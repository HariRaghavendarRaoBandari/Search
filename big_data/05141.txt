INTRODUCTION

II. THE MODEL

A ladder system, which displays properties of both one
and higher dimensions, has been of great interest in cold
atoms [1]. A question addressed now is an eﬀect of a
magnetic ﬂux in such a system, which has been success-
fully realized by the experiments with synthetic gauge
ﬁelds on an optical superlattice [2] or an optical lattice
with a synthetic dimension [3, 4].

In the presence of a magnetic ﬂux, vortices may pene-
trate into the system, which leads to an enlargement of
the unit cell and causes nontrivial phenomena. The typ-
ical example is the Hofstadter butterﬂy originally con-
sidered in the non-interacting two dimensional system
[5]. The ladder geometry may be an ideal test ground
to reveal roles of interactions in such a system since the
powerful techniques used in one dimension are available
[6].

The ﬂux ladder has been analyzed in the context of the
condensed matter, which is mostly on fermions [7–9]. An
advantage in cold atoms is that one can also study the
bosonic ladder [10–22]. As the band structure is evolved
as a function of a magnetic ﬂux, a weak-coupling regime
in such a model is already nontrivial. Especially, the
bosons are sensitive to a shape of the band, since they
tend to occupy states around the bottoms of the lowest
band. Therefore, one can expect a drastic change of the
low-energy properties due to the band evolution caused
by a ﬂux.

The purpose of this paper is to diagnose a weak-
coupling regime of the bosonic ﬂux ladder in the light
of a formalism developed in Ref.
[18]. By looking at a
regime where Bose-Einstein condensation is absent due
to quantum ﬂuctuations, we discuss which properties pre-
dicted at the mean-ﬁeld level should retain or change.
Motivated by the recent experimental realization of the
synthetic dimension, we also discuss a role of an inter-
chain interaction.

In Sec. II, we introduce the model discussed in this pa-
per and review the several properties in a weak-coupling
regime. Section III explains our formalism and mentions
a similarity to fermion systems. Results based on our
formalism are shown in Sec. IV. Section V is devoted to
the summary.

intrachain and interchain hoppings are denoted by J and
K, respectively, and U represents the on-site Hubbard
interaction, which is assumed to be positive in order to
ensure the stability of the large system size limit. In the
case of the synthetic dimension, an interchain interac-
tion shows up due to collisions between diﬀerent internal
states. This coupling is denoted as V , and has the similar
value as U for the 87Rb case [4] [23].

In accordance with the above Hamiltonian, the chiral

and rung currents are deﬁned as

which are important to characterize diﬀerent phases in
the system. In order to ensure that a magnetic ﬂux is ap-
plied in the system, below, we adopt the following gauge:
A(cid:107),1 = −A(cid:107),2 = φ

2 , A⊥ = 0.

A. Phases in the absence of V

The phase structure in a weak coupling has been ﬁrst
discussed by Orignac and Giamarchi [10]. By assuming
J (cid:29) K, U and using the bosonization method, the Meiss-
ner and vortex phases have been obtained. In the former
phase realized in a low-ﬁeld regime, the rung current van-
ishes whilest the chiral current increases as increasing a
ﬂux. In the latter phase realized in a high-ﬁeld regime,
on the other hand, the chiral current decreases as increas-
ing a ﬂux due to the penetration of vortices. An implicit

assumption used in Ref. [10] is that the mean density in
each chain takes the same value, n1 = n2. However, it
will turn out that this is the nontrivial assumption in the
presence of a ﬂux.

Tokuno and Georges have introduced another ap-
proach where the two hoppings J and K are treated in a
non-perturbative manner [14]. By diagonalizing the sin-
gle particle Hamiltonian and keeping degrees of freedom
near the bottoms of the lower band, the low-energy eﬀec-
tive theory based on the bosonization method has been
discussed.
In this analysis, the Meissner phase is ob-
tained when the lower band has a single minimum, while
the vortex phase is obtained when it has double minima.
It has also been shown that in the mean-ﬁeld analysis at
the atomic limit, the population-balance solution n1 = n2
realized in the Meissner and vortex phases exists. In ad-
dition, it has been mentioned that at certain parameter
regime, the Hessian matrix for the mean-ﬁeld energy be-
comes negative, implying that such a population-balance
solution is unstable.

Wei and Mueller have explicitly shown with the Gross-
Pitaevskii (GP) approach that a biased ladder phase,
which has a population imbalance between the legs, in-
deed exists [15].
In the biased ladder phase, the rung
current vanishes, while the chiral current decreases as in-
creasing a ﬂux. In fact, their analysis is similar to one in
Ref. [14] in the sense that the degrees of freedom around
the bottoms of the lower band are considered. An essen-
tial diﬀerence is that they explicitly consider the follow-
ing form of a many-body ground state [15]:

|GS(cid:105) =

1√
N !

(eiθ+ cos γβ

†
Q + eiθ− sin γβ

†
−Q)N|0(cid:105), (4)

†
where β
±Q is the creation operator of a boson at the bot-
toms of the lower band k = ±Q, θ± is the phase factor,
and γ describes a population rate between the minima.
Notice also that through a unitary transformation, βk
is related to bk,p, which is the Fourier transformation of
bl,p. Thus, it is natural to expect that the optimal ground
state aﬀects the density proﬁle in each chain. Indeed, it
has been shown that γ can be 0 or π/2, where all the
bosons occupy one of the minima and spontaneous pop-
ulation imbalance between the legs occurs.

More recently, an extensive analysis based on the
bosonization method has been done in Ref. [18]. There,
ﬂuctuations from the GP approach Eq. (4) and umklapp
scatterings neglected in Ref. [15] have been incorporated
to explain the low-energy properties of the system.
In
terms of this analysis, below, we wish to discuss some is-
sues of the bosonic ﬂux ladder by focusing on points not
discussed in Ref. [18].

III. FORMALISM

As far as the weak-coupling regime (K, J (cid:29) U, V )
is concerned, bosons tend to populate neighborhood of
the bottoms of the lower band, and therefore, we neglect

2

the eﬀect of the upper band. As mentioned above, the
present model shows that the lower band evolves as one
with the single minimum to one with the two minima as
increasing magnitude of a ﬂux.

In the case of the single minimum which corresponds
to the Meissner phase, the problem is almost reduced to
the single chain one without a ﬂux since bl,p ∼ 1√
βl,
which is the boson operator of the lower band at a site
l [14, 18]. Thus, we do not expect any local density or
current pattern as in the case of the single chain system.
The only diﬀerence from the case without a ﬂux is an
emergence of a nonzero chiral current.

2

On the other hand, in the case of the two minima where
the vortex and biased ladder phases can be obtained,
more involved situations appear. To see this, we note
that by means of the long-wave length approximation,
we obtain the following relations in real space [14, 18]:

factors appearing at the diagonalization of the single
particle Hamiltonian. In the above, β+(−),l is the bosonic
operatorat at a site l deﬁned in the right (left) bottom
of the lower band.
In the formulation in [14, 18], the
bosonization is performed not in bl,p but in βl,± as

(cid:114)

βl,± =

(cid:88)

(7)

where ϕ and θ are real ﬁelds describing density and phase
ﬂuctuations, respectively, and n± is the mean density [6].
Thus, the ﬁelds bl,p are decomposed into the slow ﬁelds
ϕ± and θ±, and rapidly oscillating factors e±iQl.

The situation above is similar to the bosonization of
fermions in the sence that the fermion operators are de-
composed into the similar bosonic slow ﬁelds (ϕ and θ)
and oscillating factors e±ikF l with the Fermi momentum
kF [6]. Since in the case of fermions, kF is related to the
density, commensurability of kF leads to the famous Mott
transition. In the bosonization language, this commen-
surability introduces a cosine term in density ﬂuctuation
ﬁeld ϕ. Then, the Mott transition at half ﬁlling occurs
if the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) parameter K is
less than 1. In addition, by changing the chemical poten-
tial, which can be represented as ∇ϕ in the bosonization,
the commensurate-incommensurate (C-IC) transition is
allowed. There, an inﬁnitesimal change in chemical po-
tential does not give rise to this transition, which is al-
lowed if the chemical potential added is of the order of
the Mott gap [6].

Based on the above observations, we come back to Eqs.
(5),(6),(7) to see fundamental rules in each parameter. In

the presence of the double minima in the lower band, we
can discuss commensurability of Q. In this case, a co-
sine term in phase ﬂuctuation ﬁeld θ± emerges. Since
such a cosine term is relevant for a large TLL parameter
[6], which is indeed the case for the weakly-interacting
bosons, an instability of the TLL emerges. Due to this
mechanism, the commensurate vortex phase is obtained.
As in the case of the Mott insulator, we can also discuss
the C-IC transition in the vortex phase. There, the mag-
netic ﬂux φ plays a similar role as the chemical potential
in the Mott insulator. Namely, an inﬁnitesimal change of
φ does not invoke a change of Q (or vortex density) and
the C-IC transition. The change of Q and C-IC transition
is allowed if the change of φ exceeds the gap.

IV. RESULTS

Below, we discuss several properties in terms of our
formalism especially by focusing on the case of the band
with the two minima and points which are not discussed
in Ref. [18]. In order to successfully apply the bosoniza-
tion (7), we ﬁrst need to determine the mean density n±.
In our formalism, this can been done by the GP analysis
[15, 18]. As mentioned above, there are two solutions:
population balance and imbalance ones. Sections IV A,
B, C discuss V = 0 case, and V (cid:54)= 0 case is discussed in
Sec. IV D.

A. Population-imbalance solution

The biased ladder phase belongs to the population-
imbalance solution where n+ = n, n− = 0 or n+ = 0,
n− = n is selected spontaneously. While there are the
rapidly oscillating factors in Eqs. (5) and (6), these fac-
tors do not play any role in the density and current ex-
pression since β+,l or β−,l is dropped in the biased ladder
phase. Thus, the local patterns on the density and cur-
rent are not expected. As ﬁrst pointed out in Ref. [15],
the peculiarity of this phase is rather nl,1 (cid:54)= nl,2 originat-
ing from sin ξQ

2 (cid:54)= cos ξQ
2 .

We also point out that at the transition point between
the biased ladder and vortex phases, an arbitrary imbal-
ance between n+ and n− is allowed due to the emergent
SU(2) symmetry in the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian
[18]. This point is interpreted as the special case of the
population-imbalance solution.

B. Population-balance solution

Let us now look at local density proﬁle following an
analysis in Ref. [15]. Within the GP analysis, one obtains

where we note that in Ref. [15], θ+ = θ− = 0 is implic-
itly assumed. The above expression means that except
2 π (m ∈ Z), the density in each
for 2Ql−θ+ +θ−− = 2m+1
leg is oscillating. However, we point out that the above
prediction requires considerable attention and one must
separately discuss the incommensurate and commensu-
rate Q cases.
In the incommensurate ﬂux case, ﬁxing θ+ − θ− at
some constant is directly related to the presence of an
axial U(1) symmetry in the low-energy Hamiltonian and
its breaking at the mean-ﬁeld level. The axial U(1) sym-
metry represents that the low-energy Hamiltonian is in-
variant under the transformation βl,± → e±iθβl,± with
a phase θ [18]. Then, the GP analysis predicts that the
axial U(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken. However,
as far as the thermodynamic limit is concerned, such a
ﬁxing does not occur since the U(1) symmetry breaking
in 1D system is not allowed [24]. To see this directly,
let us examine quantum ﬂuctuation eﬀects by means of

ing term in Eq.

(θ+ − θ−) is not the constant but the
where θa = 1√
ﬁeld operator. Since the low-energy eﬀective Hamilto-
nian on θa is shown to be the TLL one [18], we found that
the oscillation in local density predicted by the mean-
ﬁeld theory disappears by quantum ﬂuctuations, that is,
2θa)(cid:105) = 0. On the other hand, the recent
DMRG simulation has rather conﬁrmed local patterns
in the incommensurate vortex phase [19]. We think that
such local patterns occurring at the incommensurate vor-
tex phase could originate from eﬀects outside the reach
of the simple low-energy eﬀective theory.

On the other hand, in the commensurate ﬂux case,
the situation becomes diﬀerent. This is due to the fact
that in the presence of the umklapp terms, the axial U(1)
symmetry is explicitly broken [18]. Below, we show that
this explicit breaking of the continuous symmetry rather
supports the ﬁxing of the relative phase.
We ﬁrst consider the case of Q = π/2 (φ ≈ π). In this
case, due to the umklapp scattering, the following term
in the Hamiltonian is induced at the mean-ﬁeld level [18]:
g cos 2(θ+−θ−) with a positive g. Thus, θ+−θ− = 2m+1

.

(9)

The mean density of the vortex phase is the same be-
tween the two minima, that is, n+ = n− = n
2 . In this
case, both of the rapidly oscillating terms, eiQl and e−iQl
in Eqs. (5) and (6) play an important role.

√

We point out that the above relation holds at the
bosonization level since the umklapp scattering intro-
duces cos 2
2θa which is always relevant in a weak cou-
pling and locks θa [18]. This behavior around φ ≈ π is
consistent with the DMRG simulation [19].

We also look at the other commensurate cases where
Q = p
q π with two mutually prime integers p, q. As
discussed in Refs.
[10, 14], by considering perturba-
tion theory to order q, the seemingly irrelevant term
cos(

2θa − 2Ql) induces a term,

√

√

cos(q

2θa),

(10)

which is relevant perturbation. Thus, θa is ﬁxed, which
leads to a periodic pattern of the local density. An in-
teresting point here is that the local periodic pattern in
density is induced as a consequence of the breaking of
the discrete symmetry

We also note that the similar argument is possible for
the local current. Namely, in the incommensurate vortex
phase, a local current pattern emerged at the mean-ﬁeld
theory disappears by the bosonization treatment [25]. In
the commensurate vortex phase, such a local current pat-
tern is allowed within the bosonization due to the break-
ing of the discrete symmetry.

C. Chiral-current reversal

Recently, Greschner et al. revealed that by means of
the DMRG, the sign of the chiral current can be changed
in the vicinity of commensurate vortex phase [19]. Here,
we interpret such a chiral-current reversal in terms of our
formalism [26].

We ﬁrst consider the case in the vicinity of φ = π (Q =
π
2 ). When φ is identical to π, since the chiral current is
given by jc(l) = 2nJ sin ξπ/2(−1)l, the net chiral current
vanishes [14],

jc(l) = 0.

We now look at a regime where the ﬂux value is given by
φ = π + δ and δ is small such a way that the system is in
the commensurate vortex phase. The intrachain hopping
is then bosonized as

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

(13)

where we used the fact that θa is locked in the commen-
surate vortex phase. Thus, it turns out that the chiral-
current reversal occurs around φ ≈ π since jc is negative

4

for δ < 0, which has the opposite sign compared to the
chiral current in the incommensurate vortex phase.

We next consider the other commensurate cases. Then,
it turns out that in such a case, in addition to δ depen-
dent terms, there is a δ independent term [14]. Thus, to
discuss the chiral current reversal in the Q (cid:54)= π
2 case, we
have to compare the magnitudes of the diﬀerent terms,
each of which has the diﬀerent sign. Within the bosoniza-
tion method, however, it is diﬃcult to obtain the solid
answer in Q (cid:54)= π
2 .

D. Long-range interaction along rung direction:

synthetic dimension

Through a perspective of the synthetic dimension, we
introduce interchain interaction, V . As mentioned in Sec.
II, the coupling V takes a similar value with the onsite
coupling U . Therefore, we ﬁrst look at the interaction
terms in the limit U = V , which is given by
[(nl,1 + nl,2)2 − (nl,1 + nl,2)].

(cid:88)

(14)

Apparently, the above term has SU(2) symmetry, and
therefore one may expect that the ferromagnetic ground
state due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of SU(2)
as in the case of the two-component bosons [27]. While
the above argument may give some insight to what hap-
pens in the presence of V , one must care about the fact
that the kinetic term in the Hamiltonian explicitly breaks
the SU(2) symmetry.

To determine the phase structure, we now use the GP
approach [28]. In the case of an incommensurate Q, the
mean-ﬁeld energy is obtained as

where E−(Q) is the single particle spectrum in the lower
band at k = Q, ∆ = V − U describes the mismatch
from the isotropic limit. Notice that as in the case of
V = 0 [18], the energy does not depend on the phase
factor θ±, which is related to the absence of the umklapp
scattering between k = ±Q. As far as a weak-coupling
regime is concerned, the number of minima in the lower
band plays a crucial role in determining the phase struc-
ture.
In the single minimum case, as in V = 0, the
Meissner phase is obtained. To discuss the two mini-
mum case, we consider the regime where the mismatch is
small |∆/U| (cid:28) 1, considering the experiment with 87Rb
[4]. We then ﬁnd through Eq. (15) that in contrast to
the V = 0 case, the biased ladder phase is favored [29].
In accordance with the analysis in Ref. [18], one can also
discuss the quantum ﬂuctuation eﬀects from the above
mean-ﬁeld analysis. Then, it is straightforward to show

that the phase structure does not change by the ﬂuctua-
tions while a Bose-Einstein condensate predicted at the
mean-ﬁeld level is substituted by the TLL both in the
Meissner and biased-ladder phases.

widely favored. In the presence of the umklapp scatter-
ing, which prefers the population-balance solution, the
transition between the population imbanance and bal-
ance solutions is also allowed as a function of ∆.

We next consider the Q = π

commensurability in the weak-coupling limit. By using

where the relative phase dependence comes out via the

In the ground
state, cos 2(θ+ − θ−) = −1 if |∆/U| is small. We then
ﬁnd that the vortex phase is stabilized if ∆ < 0, and the
biased ladder phase is stabilized if ∆ > 0. Notice also
that at this mean-ﬁeld level an arbitrary imbalance state
is allowed when ∆ = 0.

In total, through the analysis with the nonzero V , it
has been found that the population-imbalance solution is

V. SUMMARY

In this paper, we considered the two-leg bosonic lad-
der model in the presence of a magnetic ﬂux especially
in the weak-coupling regime where a Bose-Einstein con-
densate is absent. Commensurability on a ﬂux plays an
important role in determining the low-energy properties,
which is in sharp contrasts to the Bose system with the
spin-orbit coupling in a continuum space, where the C-
IC transition is absent [30]. As long as the interaction
strength is larger than the temperature, the C-IC tran-
sition emerges even in a weak-coupling limit unlike the
Mott insulator case. Our formalism may be useful to
discuss the three or more leg ladder case.

[23] To be precise, the on-site interaction U can take a diﬀer-
ent value in each chain in the synthetic dimension case.
Here, we neglect such a diﬀerence, for instance, by con-
sidering that it is smaller than the temperature of the
system.

[24] The symmetry breaking may occur if one considers the
eﬀects of coupings to higher dimensions, ﬁnite systems,
and the trap, which may be relevant to the experiment.
[25] We do not imply that a local current pattern does not ex-
ist. Taking into account that there is nonzero vortex den-
sity in the vortex phase, there must exist such a pattern
in reality. It is just diﬃcult to show it with the low-energy
eﬀective theory.
[26] The chiral-current reversal in the regime J (cid:29) K, U has

also been implicitly discussed in Ref. [10].
