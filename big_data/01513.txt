We present electrically detected electron nuclear double resonance measurements of the nuclear
spins of ionized and neutral arsenic donors in strained silicon. In addition to a reduction of the
hyperﬁne coupling, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant quadrupole interactions of the nuclear spin of the neutral
donors of the order of 10 kHz. By comparing these to the quadrupole shifts due to crystal ﬁelds
measured for the ionized donors, we identify the eﬀect of the additional electron on the electric ﬁeld
gradient at the nucleus. This extra component is expected to be caused by the coupling to electric
ﬁeld gradients created due to changes in the electron wavefunction under strain.

The electron and nuclear spins of donors in silicon have
evolved as promising candidates for quantum applica-
tions, with extremely long coherence times [1–4], detec-
tion down to the single-spin level [5, 6], electrical con-
trol [7–10] and coupling to superconducting resonators
[11, 12]. One of the challenges in the design of the in-
volved nanostructures is the generation of uncontrolled
mechanical stress due to material interfaces formed by in-
sulators, metal gates or superconducting resonators with
the Si host crystal. These stresses are often distributed
over a broad range and can be hard to predict, still their
inﬂuence has to be considered for a correct quantitative
description of the quantum system [13, 14].

The inﬂuence of strain on the wavefunctions of donors
in silicon has long been known [15]. When stress is ap-
plied along the direction of two of the conduction band
minima, the energy of these minima is lowered, break-
ing the 6-fold degeneracy of the conduction band and
leading to a mixing of the electronic ground state of
the donor with excited states. Because of the ensuing
changes to the wavefunction, the hyperﬁne coupling con-
stant A, which is proportional to the probability density
at the nucleus |ψ(0)|2, is reduced, as has been shown ex-
perimentally [15, 16] and suggested as a possible tuning
mechanism for qubits [17].
In electron spin resonance
(ESR) experiments at weak magnetic ﬁelds [13, 18] or on
donors with strong hyperﬁne coupling, such as bismuth in
silicon [4, 13], a mixing of electron and nuclear spin states
leads to a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) properties on the ESR measurements
[4, 19]. For donors with nuclear spin I > 1/2, therefore,
the quadrupole interaction with electric ﬁeld gradients
has to be considered, in particular when strains are in-
volved. While interactions with crystal ﬁeld gradients
cancel out in the cubic symmetry of unstrained silicon,
they can signiﬁcantly shift the NMR of ionized donors
under strain and shear [20]. For donors in their neutral
charge state, the mixing with excited states under strain
breaks the symmetry of the wavefunction, which could
lead to an additional non-zero quadrupolar eﬀect due to
ﬁeld gradients connected to the electron charge distri-

bution [21]. NMR shifts due to these two mechanisms,
crystal ﬁelds and changes to the electronic wavefunction,
are not easily separated experimentally, as their inﬂu-
ence on the observed spectra would be expected to be
qualitatively equal. The necessary theoretical treatment,
however, is diﬀerent. While the eﬀect of crystal ﬁelds is
connected to local changes to bonds with neighboring Si
atoms, the symmetry breaking of the wavefunction can
be described by treating the host material as a dielec-
tric continuum [15]. In this work, we measure the NMR
of neutral arsenic donors in strained silicon and iden-
tify quadrupole shifts of the resonance lines. We com-
pare these to the shifts observed for the NMR of ionized
donors in the same samples and ﬁnd evidence for a com-
ponent that is observed only in the neutral charge state
and should be connected to changes in the wavefunction.

The Hamiltonian H characterizing neutral arsenic
donors with electron spin S = {Sx, Sy, Sz} and nuclear
spin I = {Ix, Iy, Iz} consists of four diﬀerent interactions,
here ordered by their typical strengths from highest to

shifts towards lower frequencies for of all six transitions.
On the other hand, a change in γn should act on the two
subensembles with diﬀerent signs. The inﬂuence of the
ﬁrst-oder quadrupole interaction is sketched in the last
column of Fig. 1 (a). While there is no eﬀect on the two
central transitions 2 and 5, the satellite transitions are
shifted by +νQ (1 and 6) and −νQ (3 and 4). Quantita-
tively this is shown in Fig. 1 (b), where the six transition
frequencies for arsenic donors are plotted as a function of
the magnetic ﬁeld with (dashed lines) and without (solid
lines) a hypothetical quadrupole interaction of νQ = 0.5
MHz.

The samples used in this work are Czochralski-grown
silicon wafers implanted with As+ ions at low energies.
This creates a doped region with a depth of ∼ 50 nm
below the surface. As part of the implantation damage,
oxygen-vacancy complexes are formed, which, in their
excited triplet state (SL1), are an eﬃcient recombination
partner for As donors [24, 25]. This allows us to perform
electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) exper-
iments providing the high sensitivity needed. The sam-
ples remained unannealed, were contacted with Cr/Au
interdigit structures and biased with typically 5 V. Elec-
trically detected electron nuclear double resonance (EN-
DOR) measurements were performed in a Bruker ﬂexline
resonator for pulsed ENDOR at a temperature of 8 K in
a He ﬂow cryostat, illumination was provided by a red
light emitting diode. The applied measuring scheme is
based on the selective ionization of donors depending on
their nuclear spin state as part of a spin-dependent re-
combination process and is discussed in detail in Ref. 20,
26, and 27. This recombination leads to two subensem-
bles with diﬀerent charge states, ionized donors Si:As+
and neutral donors Si:As0. Because of the selectivity of
the ionization, both ensembles are highly polarized and
their NMR transitions can be accessed in the ENDOR
experiments. The detection is performed on the same
electron spin resonance line as the selective ionization,
which means that we expect a positive signal for neutral
nuclear spin resonances and a negative signal for reso-
nances of ionized donors [27].

Figure 2 shows electrically detected ENDOR spectra
recorded on the four hyperﬁne-split electron resonance
lines. As expected, the nuclear magnetic resonances of
the neutral As donors are observed as an enhancement
in signal amplitude. Each measurement is sensitive to
transitions which involve the nuclear spin state chosen
for ionization and read-out (given next to the traces in
Fig. 2), hence every resonance is detected in two of the
spectra. The observed line positions are well described
by a ﬁt to the expected magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the
spin system Hamiltonian (1) which is shown as dashed
lines.

To study the eﬀect of strain on these resonances, sam-
ples with diﬀerent crystal orientations were cemented
onto sapphire substrates, which at low temperatures in-

−1/2 for ϑ = 90◦.
In a non-zero magnetic ﬁeld, the eigenstates of H
split up in two subensembles with electron spin projec-
tions mS = 1/2 and −1/2, which are further divided
into four levels with diﬀerent nuclear spin projections

In
the limit of high magnetic ﬁelds and without quadrupole
interactions the transition frequencies νmS = |mSA− ν0|
are equal within each subensemble. While the high-ﬁeld
limit is not reached in the experiments below, it still al-
lows us to discuss the qualitative changes expected due
to changes in the diﬀerent coupling constants. For a re-
duction of the hyperﬁne constant A, we expect similar

angular dependence for ϑ = ϕ.

To give a more detailed analysis of the observed reso-
nances of the neutral donors, the peak positions are ex-
tracted by ﬁtting with pseudo-Voigt functions (shape fac-
tors ∼ 0.5). For the resulting data, least square ﬁts to
the expected peak positions are performed, using the hy-
perﬁne constant A and the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio
γn as ﬁtting parameters. We then plot the deviation of
the observed peak position from these ﬁts to study any
behavior that can not well be described considering only
these two interactions. The resulting residuals for the
As0 NMR in the sample strained along the [100] axis are
shown as full circles in Fig. 4 (a) for ϕ = 0. Clearly, a
systematic deviation from 0 is observed, which is positive
and about equal for resonances 1 and 6, negative but of
similar absolute value for 3 and 4, and close to zero for
resonances 2 and 5. This mirrors the expected shift due
to a quadrupole interaction (cf. Fig. 1). When including
the term describing the quadrupole interaction in the ﬁt,
a signiﬁcantly better result is achieved (empty circles)
and the remaining deviations seem unsystematic and are
expected to reﬂect the experimental noise. The resulting
quadrupole shift ν0
Q is shown as a blue dashed line in
Fig. 4. When the sample is rotated in the magnetic ﬁeld
by ∆ϕ = 90◦, the sign of νQ changes (data not shown).
Performing the same analysis for the data obtained on
the [111] Si:As sample for ϕ = 0◦ (data not shown) and
ϕ = 90◦ [Fig. 4 (b)], a similar systematic deviation is
observed. Again, the residuals are very well explained
by a quadrupolar eﬀect and the measurements at diﬀer-
ent angles are very well described by the expected angu-
lar dependence (2) for an eﬀective electric ﬁeld gradient
generated along the strain axis (ϑ = ϕ). The constants

duces strain due to the diﬀerent thermal expansion coeﬃ-
cients [28, 29]. We assume the resulting strain to be uni-
axial and normal to the Si/sapphire interface. Note that
the angle ϕ between this normal and the magnetic ﬁeld
Bz is not per se equal to ϑ, which describes the orienta-
tion of the generated electric ﬁeld gradient. Figure 3 (a)
shows spectra obtained for Si/sapphire stacks with sam-
ples from [100] and [111] wafers. Compared to the line
position of an unstrained sample, both As0 related res-
onances in each of the spectra are shifted towards lower
frequencies. This indicates that the dominant eﬀect on
the line position is a reduction of the hyperﬁne coupling
to the donor electron and not a quadrupole interaction,
which would shift the two lines of each spectrum in dif-
ferent directions (cf. Fig. 1). Such a reduction of the
hyperﬁne constant A is expected for strain that lifts the
symmetry of the six conduction band minima in silicon,
which is expected for our [100] sample. More quanti-
tatively, A(χ)/A(0) = 1

with the unitless valleystrain χ (cf. Ref. 15), which is a
measure for the strain-induced asymmetric change of the
electron wavefunction. This leads to asymmetric electric
ﬁeld gradients, which interact with the nuclear spin of
the donor via quadrupole interaction. We therefore ex-
pect that any quadrupole shift due to the electron wave-
function is connected to χ. For strain in [111] direction,
the energy of all conduction band minima is lowered by
the same amount and χ = 0 [15]. Still, we also observe a
reduced hyperﬁne coupling in the [111] sample, suggest-
ing that the strain in the Si/sapphire stack is not purely
along the [111] axis and χ (cid:54)= 0 also in this case.

At lower frequencies [Fig. 3 (b)], the spin resonance of
the ionized donors As+ is observed as a negative signal.

Q − ν+

To investigate the origin of these quadrupole shifts, we
compare them to the shifts ν+
Q observed on the ionized
donors Si:As+ for each of the samples, which are shown as
green dotted lines in Fig. 4 (a) and (b). For both samples,
these shifts are slightly smaller than those observed for
the neutral donors ν0
Q (blue lines). This suggests that we
observe an additional quadrupole interaction connected
to the donor electron, the strength of which can be es-
timated by taking the diﬀerences ∆νQ = ν0
Q of
the frequency shifts. The values for both samples are
given in Tab. I. For the [100] sample, ∆νQ of 31(11)
and -14(18) kHz are observed at ϕ = 0 and 90 de-
grees, respectively. The factor ∼ −1/2 between the two
measurements is once more in agreement with the ex-
pected angular dependence (2), if the electric ﬁeld gra-
dient V ∆
33 connected to the electron wavefunction is gen-
erated parallel to the strain axis in the [100] direction
of our sample. Since the conduction band minima in Si
are along the (100) axes, this would indeed be expected.
Using (2), we can calculate an electric ﬁeld gradient
33 = 7.8 ± 10 × 1018 V/m2, which is generated upon
V ∆
the application of a uniaxial strain ⊥ = 2.3(5) × 10−4
along the [100] axis, as calculated from the observed
change of the hyperﬁne coupling [16]. For the [111] sam-
ple, ∆νQ of 21(9) and -12(9) kHz are observed at ϕ = 0
and 90 degrees, respectively. As discussed above, while
in principle no change to the symmetry of the wavefunc-
tion is expected for strain in [111] direction, the reduction
of A indicates the presence of a (weaker) valley strain χ,
probably due to a slightly diﬀerent strain axis in our sam-
ples. Consequently, a weaker but non-zero ∆νQ would
be expected in this sample as well, which is in agree-
ment with our measurements. The observed shifts corre-
spond to an eﬀective electric ﬁeld gradient at the nucleus
33 = 6.1 ± 5 × 1018 V/m2 which is generated approxi-
V ∆
mately along the strain axis. Comparing the values for
χ and V ∆
33 measured in the two samples, the observed
monotonous and possibly linear dependence strongly sug-
gests that strain components altering the wavefunction
symmetry are responsible for the observed additional
quadrupolar eﬀects in the neutral charge state.

In summary, we report shifts to the NMR of neutral

donors in strained silicon which agree with the behavior
expected for quadrupolar eﬀects. These shifts diﬀer from
the quadrupole shifts due to crystal ﬁeld gradients which
we determine via the NMR of ionized donors and indicate
the presence of an additional quadrupole interaction of
a similar order of magnitude. This interaction, which is
only observed in the neutral charge state, is likely to be
connected to electric ﬁeld gradients caused by changes to
the wavefunction of the donor electron. The measured
shifts are, however, smaller than those due to the strain-
induced change to the hyperﬁne interaction by more than
one order of magnitude, clearly demonstrating that the
quadrupole interaction is not the dominant mechanism
in high-ﬁeld NMR experiments on arsenic donors silicon.
For ESR measurements on mixed spin states, the inﬂu-
ence of A and νQ on the resonance positions strongly de-
pends on the observed transition and applied magnetic
ﬁeld [21]. In particular, the inﬂuence of the hyperﬁne in-
teraction vanishes at certain ﬁelds [19], so that νQ could
be the central inﬂuence of strain on the spectrum in this
case. Even though the errors to the values measured here
are still large, we can conclude that such wavefunction-
induced gradients are of the same order of magnitude as
the eﬀects due to crystal ﬁeld gradients and that both
eﬀects should be included in the modeling of strain ef-
fects on arsenic donors in silicon. For a more complete
understanding of the dependence of ∆νQ on the wave-
function, similar measurements on other group-V donors
would be desirable. This should also help to identify the
involved anti-shielding parameters, which could lead to
much stronger eﬀective ﬁeld gradients in heavier donors
[30]. Furthermore, a more precise determination of the
resulting quadrupole shifts could possibly be achieved
when the inhomogeneous broadening of the NMR of the
neutral donors is reduced. To this end, unixaial stress
would have to be applied in a very homogeneous way.
In addition, broadening due to superhyperﬁne interac-
tions with surrounding 29Si nuclei could be reduced in
isotopically controlled Si [31]. Still, since the relevant
strains will be smaller in most nanostructures than in
our Si/sapphire stacks, our results give a valuable esti-
mation of the magnitude of quadrupolar interactions of
nuclear spins with deformations of the electron wavefunc-

tion, which should motivate further modeling and can
provide a test for future theories.
