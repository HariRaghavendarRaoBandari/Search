Abstract

We build unitary representations of the BMS algebra and its higher-spin extensions in
three dimensions, using induced representations as a guide. Our prescription naturally
emerges from an ultrarelativistic limit of highest-weight representations of Virasoro and
W algebras, which is to be contrasted with non-relativistic limits that typically give
non-unitary representations. To support this dichotomy, we also point out that the ul-
trarelativistic and non-relativistic limits of generic W algebras diﬀer in the structure of
their non-linear terms.

Introduction

It has long been known that asymptotically ﬂat gravitational theories in three and four
space-time dimensions enjoy powerful symmetries at null inﬁnity, given by an inﬁnite-
dimensional extension of the Poincar´e group known as the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS)
group [1–4]. The latter and its local generalisation [5] have been the focus of renewed
interest in the last few years due to their relation e.g. to holography [6], soft graviton
theorems [7] and black holes [8].

In three space-time dimensions this extension of Minkowski isometries is closely related
to the inﬁnite-dimensional symmetry enhancement of Anti-de Sitter space at spatial in-
ﬁnity [9]. In the latter case asymptotic symmetries are generated by two copies of the
Virasoro algebra and admit an ˙In¨on¨u-Wigner contraction that reproduces the bms3 alge-
bra.

2

In three dimensions one can also broaden the purely gravitational setup to include
“higher-spin” gauge ﬁelds3 on both ﬂat and AdS backgrounds. The equations that, for
D > 3, describe the propagation of a massless ﬁeld of spin s indeed imply the absence
of local degrees of freedom in D = 3 when s ≥ 2. This feature is manifest in the Chern-
Simons formulation of both Einstein gravity [10, 11] and higher-spin theories [12]. In this
approach one can also accommodate ﬂat backgrounds [13–15], thus bypassing the no-
go results severely constraining higher-spin interactions in D > 3 Minkowski space (see
e.g. [16]). The presence of higher-spin ﬁelds further enhances the asymptotic symmetries.
Around AdS these generically consist of two copies of a non-linear W algebra [17, 18];
around ﬂat space they consist of a non-linear higher-spin extension of the bms3 alge-
bra [14, 15], which can be obtained as a contraction of the direct sum of two W algebras.
Identifying a symmetry does not suﬃce to control its implementation at the quantum
level: to this end one also needs to select the representations that are physically relevant
in a given context. With this motivation in mind, in this note we study a class of rep-
resentations of the bms3 algebra and of its higher-spin extensions. In the gravitational
case, the representations we are going to describe are the algebraic counterpart of the
unitary representations of the BMS3 group built and classiﬁed in [19, 20] along the lines
originally used by Wigner for the Poincar´e group [21]. The Hilbert space of each such
representation consists of wavefunctionals in supermomentum space, in direct analogy
to standard quantum mechanics. In the higher-spin case, analogous induced representa-
tions were built in [22] and their Lie-algebraic version was brieﬂy investigated. The main
purpose of the present paper is to delve deeper in the details of that algebraic construction.

We stress that the inclusion of higher-spin ﬁelds is a highly non-trivial extension of the
basic setup, due to the non-linearities that appear in the symmetry algebra on both AdS
and ﬂat backgrounds. As a result, standard group-theoretic methods fail to apply. One
faces a similar situation when analyzing extended BMS symmetry in four dimensions:
representations of the globally well deﬁned BMS group have been classiﬁed [23, 24], but
a corresponding result for its local counterpart is still missing. Aside from their appli-
cations in three-dimensional higher-spin theories, we thus hope that our techniques will
also prove useful in this challenging domain.

We will ﬁrst build representations in a basis suggested by the theory of induced repre-
sentations of Lie algebras, before showing how one can move to a basis of supermomentum
eigenstates analogous to one-particle states with deﬁnite momentum. For that reason,
in sect. 2 we brieﬂy review the construction of representations of the three-dimensional
Poincar´e algebra in a way that simpliﬁes generalisations to the bms3 algebra and its higher-

context it is customary to use the word “spin” to label the representations of the Lorentz group under
which ﬁelds transform.

spin extensions. We also recall how standard unitary representations of the Poincar´e al-
gebra emerge from an ultrarelativistic limit of highest-weight representations of so(2, 2).
We then apply a similar construction to the bms3 algebra in sect. 3, and to its higher-
spin extensions in sect. 4. In both cases we also comment on the emergence of unitary
representations from an ultrarelativistic limit of highest-weight representations of the (ex-
tended) local conformal algebra, while stressing that non-relativistic limits naturally lead
to non-unitary representations as those considered in [25, 26].

2 Poincar´e modules in three dimensions

The unitary representations of the Poincar´e group in three dimensions were classiﬁed
in [27] and recently reviewed e.g. in [19] due to their relation with BMS3 representations.
Here we discuss how Wigner’s standard method for the construction of irreducible, unitary
representations of the Poincar´e group (as presented e.g. in [28]) can be recovered from
induced representations of the Poincar´e algebra, also known as Poincar´e modules. The
advantage of this approach is that such modules can also be built for the bms3 algebra
and its non-linear higher-spin generalisations.

2.1 The Poincar´e algebra

In three dimensions, the Lie algebra of the Poincar´e group is spanned by three Lorentz
generators Jm and three translation generators Pm (m = −1, 0, 1) whose Lie brackets read

[Jm, Jn] = (m − n) Jm+n ,
[Jm, Pn] = (m − n) Pm+n ,
[Pm, Pn] = 0 .

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

(2.1c)

Our conventions are such that these basis elements generate the complexiﬁcation of the
Poincar´e algebra. Real translations, for example, are generated by linear combinations
αmPm with complex coeﬃcients satisfying (αm)∗ = α−m; similarly real boosts are gen-
erated by combinations zJ1 + z∗J−1 while rotations are generated by θJ0, with θ real.
Accordingly, in any unitary representation, the operators representing Poincar´e genera-
tors must satisfy the hermiticity conditions

(Pm)† = P−m ,

(Jm)† = J−m .

(2.2)

Note that the Pm’s correspond to the standard translation generators P µ (with µ = 0, 1, 2
a Lorentz index) as P0 = P 0, P1 = P 1 + iP 2 and P−1 = P 1 − iP 2.

The three-dimensional Poincar´e algebra is thus the semi-direct sum

iso(2, 1) = sl(2, R) Aad (sl(2, R))Ab

(2.3)

4

where sl(2, R) ∼= so(2, 1) is the Lorentz algebra (generated by Jm’s) and (sl(2, R))Ab is an
Abelian Lie algebra of translations (generated by Pm’s) isomorphic to the Lorentz algebra
as a vector space, and acted upon by Lorentz transformations according to the adjoint
representation. The Poincar´e algebra admits two quadratic Casimir operators: the mass
squared

and the three-dimensional analogue of the square of the Pauli-Lubanski vector,

M2 = P 2

0 − P1P−1

S = P0J0 −

4

(J1P−1 + J−1P1 + P1J−1 + P−1J1) .

(2.4)

(2.5)

The eigenvalues of these operators can be used to classify irreducible representations.

2.2 Poincar´e modules

Irreducible unitary representations of the Poincar´e group are obtained by considering
the orbit of a given momentum under Lorentz transformations — i.e. all momenta pµ =
(p0, p1, p2) that satisfy p2 = −M 2 for some mass M — and building a Hilbert space of
wavefunctions on that orbit. The eigenvalue of P0 gives the energy of the corresponding
particle and inspection of (2.1) shows that the operators that commute with P0 are P1,
P−1 and J0. It is therefore natural to build a basis of eigenstates of momentum for the
Hilbert space of wavefunctions on the orbit; we will denote such eigenstates by |pµ, si.
These correspond to plane waves of deﬁnite momentum pµ, while s ∈ R is a spin label
related to the eigenvalue of J0 in a particular frame (see eq. (2.7)). Diﬀerent values of
s yield inequivalent irreducible representations [27, 19]. Under a Lorentz transformation
parametrised by Λµ

ν these wavefunctions transform as

U(Λ)|pµ, si = eisθ|Λµ

νpν, si ,

(2.6)

where U(Λ) is a unitary operator and θ is a Λ-dependent Wigner angle. The components
pµ with µ = 0, 1, 2 are related to the eigenvalues pm of the generators Pm by p0 = p0,
p1 = (p1 + p−1)/2 and p2 = (p1 − p−1)/2i.

Lorentz transformations act transitively on the momentum orbit, so for each ﬁxed
value of the mass squared one can choose a “standard” momentum kµ and obtain all
plane waves by acting with Lorentz boosts on the corresponding wavefunction |kµ, si. For
massive representations — on which we focus for the sake of comparison with bms3 and its
higher-spin extensions — one can choose as a representative the momentum kµ = (M, 0, 0)
of the particle at rest. We denote by |M, si the corresponding wavefunction, which satisﬁes
(2.7)

P0|M, si = M|M, si , P−1|M, si = P1|M, si = 0 ,

J0|M, si = s|M, si ,

and call it the rest-frame state of the representation. To obtain a plane wave |pµ, si
with boosted momentum, one can act with a Lorentz transformation implemented by the

5

unitary operator

U(ω) = exp [ i (ωJ1 + ω∗J−1)] ,

where ω is the complex rapidity

ω =

i
2

arcsinh(cid:18)√p1p−1

M (cid:19) p−1
√p1p−1

(2.8)

(2.9)

that one can obtain by inverting the relation pµ = Λµ

νkν taking into account (2.2).

The previous discussion is standard, but note that (2.7) deﬁnes a one-dimensional
representation of the subalgebra generated by {Pm, J0}. Given a representation of a
subalgebra h of the Lie algebra g on a vector space V , one can always build a representation
of g on a suitable quotient of the space U(g) ⊗ V , where U(g) is the universal enveloping
algebra of g (see e.g. sect. 10.7 of [29]). Representations of this kind are called induced
modules. With this method one can construct an irreducible representation of the Poincar´e
algebra on the vector space HM with basis vectors4

|k, l i = (J−1)k(J1)l|M, si .

(2.10)

Upon acting from the left on the states (2.10) one obtains indeed linear operators on HM
whose commutators coincide with (2.1). Moreover, the Casimir operators (2.4) and (2.5)
have the same eigenvalue on each state (2.10), since they commute by construction with
all elements of the algebra. This readily implies that the representation thus obtained is
irreducible.

Unitarity, on the other hand, is far less obvious: it is not clear how to deﬁne a scalar
product on the space HM spanned by the states (2.10), even after enforcing the standard
hermiticity conditions (2.2). Fortunately, experience with the Poincar´e group suggests
a way to circumvent the problem.5 Upon acting on the rest frame state |M, si with a
Lorentz boost (2.8) one obtains (possibly up to an irrelevant phase) a plane wave

|pµ, si = U(Λ)|M, si .
4The states (2.10) form a basis of the induced iso(2, 1)-module

(2.11)

Indiso(2,1)

h

(ρ) ≡ (U(p3) ⊗ C) / {X ⊗ λ − 1 ⊗ ρ[X]λ| X ∈ h, λ ∈ C} ,

where h = Span{Pn, J0} and ρ is the one-dimensional C-valued representation

ρ[P0] = M ,

ρ[P−1] = ρ[P1] = 0 ,

ρ[J0] = s

deﬁned by (2.7). The quotient amounts to the rule that when one acts by the left with any element in
iso(2, 1) one moves Pm and J0 to the right by computing commutators and then lets them act on |M, si,
as is implicit in the ket notation (2.10).
5In sect. 2.3 we will also see an alternative way to deﬁne a scalar product on Poincar´e modules from

limits of representations of the so(2, 2) algebra.

Here pµ can be any momentum belonging to the orbit with mass M, provided one chooses
properly the Lorentz parameter Λ as in (2.9). Such plane wave states can be normalised
so that

where δµ is the Dirac distribution associated with the Lorentz-invariant measure

h pµ, s | qµ, s i = δµ(p, q) ,

(2.12)

(2.13)

dµ(q) =

dq1dq−1

.

2ipM 2 + q1q−1

In mapping the rest-frame state onto the states |pµ, si we applied ﬁnite Lorentz trans-
formations, so that we secretly brought the discussion back to the group-theoretic level.
Nevertheless, to perform the “change of basis” from states of the form (2.10) to eigen-
states of momentum, one does not need to control the full group structure; rather, it
suﬃces to ensure that the boost (2.8) is well deﬁned and that one can deﬁne a measure
on the momentum orbit such that (2.12) is satisﬁed (see e.g. [19] for more details). The
states obtained by acting with boosts on |M, si can then be seen as inﬁnite linear combi-
nations of states (2.10). Unitarity ﬁnally follows from the fact that plane waves form an
orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space (cf. eq. (2.12)).

2.3 Ultrarelativistic limit of sl(2, R) modules

In addition to being convenient for generalisations to inﬁnite-dimensional extensions of
the Poincar´e algebra, Poincar´e modules can be seen to arise as a limit of unitary rep-
resentations of the AdS3 isometry algebra, namely so(2, 2). Owing to the isomorphism
so(2, 2) ∼= sl(2, R) ⊕ sl(2, R), the generators of this algebra can be divided in two groups,
Lm and ¯Lm with m = −1, 0, 1, and their Lie brackets read

[Lm,Ln] = (m − n) Lm+n ,

[ ¯Lm, ¯Ln] = (m − n) ¯Lm+n .

(2.14)

As in (2.1) our conventions are such that this is a basis of the complexiﬁcation of sl(2, R),
so that real sl(2, R) matrices are linear combinations i xmLm with (xm)∗ = x−m.
In
particular, in any unitary representation the operators representing the generators Lm
and ¯Lm must satisfy the hermiticity conditions

(Lm)† = L−m ,

( ¯Lm)† = ¯L−m .

(2.15)

In terms of these basis elements the quadratic Casimir of each copy of sl(2, R) reads

C = L2

0 −

1
2

(L1L−1 + L−1L1) .

(2.16)

The Poincar´e algebra (2.1) can be recovered from an ˙In¨on¨u-Wigner contraction of (2.14)
by introducing a lenght scale ℓ (to be identiﬁed with the AdS radius) and by deﬁning the
new generators

Pm ≡

1

ℓ (cid:0)Lm + ¯L−m(cid:1) ,

7

Jm ≡ Lm − ¯L−m .

(2.17)

The Lie brackets of sl(2, R) ⊕ sl(2, R) are turned into

[Jm, Jn] = (m − n) Jm+n ,
[Jm, Pn] = (m − n) Pm+n ,
[Pm, Pn] = ℓ−2(m − n) Jm+n ,
and in the limit ℓ → ∞ one recovers the Poincar´e algebra.
In addition the quadratic
Casimir (2.16) can be combined with its counterpart ¯C in the second copy of sl(2, R),
producing

(2.18b)

(2.18c)

(2.18a)

(2.19)

2

ℓ2 (cid:0)C + ¯C(cid:1) = M2 + O(ℓ−2) ,

1

ℓ (cid:0)C − ¯C(cid:1) = S ,

where M2 and S are the Poincar´e Casimirs (2.4) and (2.5).

Aside from comparing Casimir operators, one can track how Poincar´e modules (deﬁned
by (2.7) and (2.10)) emerge from the corresponding limit of highest-weight representations
of so(2, 2). These are built out of highest-weight representations of sl(2, R), which are
deﬁned starting from a state |hi that satisﬁes the conditions
L1|hi = 0 .

L0|hi = h|hi ,

(2.20)

The carrier space of the representation is then spanned by all descendant states (L−1)m|hi,6
and the Casimir (2.16) takes the value h(h−1). If one builds a similar representation with
weight ¯h for a second copy of sl(2, R), one can produce a representation of sl(2, R)⊕sl(2, R)
from the tensor product.

To relate this tensor product — spanned by the states (L−1)m( ¯L−1)n|h, ¯hi — to a
Poincar´e module, we rewrite it in the new basis given by (2.10), where M and s are
related to the so(2, 2) weights as

h + ¯h

ℓ

,

M ≡

s ≡ h − ¯h ,

since in terms of the operators (2.17) one has

P0|h, ¯hi =

h + ¯h

ℓ

|h, ¯hi ,

J0|h, ¯hi = (h − ¯h)|h, ¯hi .

(2.21)

(2.22)

6Note that sl(2, R) highest-weight representations can also be interpreted as induced modules.
Eq. (2.20) deﬁnes indeed a one-dimensional representation of the subalgebra spanned by {L0,L1}, while
the vector space of descendant states can be identiﬁed with a quotient of U(sl(2, R)) ⊗ C as discussed
in footnote 4. The main diﬀerence with respect to the Poincar´e case is the splitting of the algebra as
n−⊕h⊕n+, where n± are nilpotent subalgebras. This decomposition allows one to deﬁne a scalar product
by enforcing the hermiticity condition (2.15). One can then verify that hh|(L1)m(L−1)m|hi is positive for
h > 0.

(2.24)

This change of basis is invertible because no Jn annihilate the vacuum. Each so(2, 2)
representation now takes the form

Jn|k, li = Xk′,l′

P(n)
k′,l′; k,l(M, s, ℓ)|k′, l′i ,
J(n)
k′,l′; k,l(M, s)|k′, l′i

(2.23a)

(2.23b)

where P(n) and J(n) are inﬁnite matrices and where only negative powers of ℓ appear in
(2.23a). These only arise because of the highest-weight conditions, which can be rewritten
as

allowing to express the action of Pn in terms of the states |k, li. As a result, the matrix
elements P(n)
k′,l′; k,l have a well deﬁned limit for ℓ → ∞. By computing the action
of the generators Pn and Jn on the Poincar´e module spanned by (2.10), one obtains the
same outcome provided that the conformal weights scale as

k′,l′; k,l and J(n)

h =

Mℓ + s

2

+ λ + O(ℓ−1),

¯h =

Mℓ − s

2

+ λ + O(ℓ−1) ,

(2.25)

where λ is an arbitrary parameter independent of ℓ. In particular, the latter condition im-
plies that in the limit the sl(2, R) highest-weight conditions (2.24) turn into the rest-frame
conditions (2.7). Note also that the Poincar´e Casimirs M2 and S take the values dictated
by the rest frame conditions. Moreover, in principle one could also deﬁne a scalar prod-
uct on Poincar´e modules starting from the limit of the scalar product hh|(L1)m(L−1)n|hi.
This procedure will lead in general to a complicated non-diagonal quadratic form. We
already know, however, that the plane-wave basis (2.12) diagonalises it, thus appearing
as a natural alternative also from this vantage point.

Relation (2.25) shows that the ﬂat limit deﬁned via (2.17) can be interpreted as an
ultrarelativistic/high-energy limit from the viewpoint of AdS3. Poincar´e modules are
thus remnants of so(2, 2) representations whose energy becomes large in the limit ℓ → ∞.
In sect. 3.4 we shall also discuss a diﬀerent contraction from so(2, 2) to iso(2, 1), to be
interpreted as a non-relativistic limit giving rise to representations of the type discussed
in [25, 26].

Induced modules for the bms3 algebra

In this section, we remark that one can readily obtain representations of the bms3 algebra
by exploiting the induced module construction introduced in sect. 2.2. We then show
how one can move to a basis of supermomentum eigenstates by following analogous steps
to those that we reviewed for the Poincar´e case. This basis then allows one to discuss

9

the irreducibility and unitarity of the induced representations. We ﬁnally display how the
previous representations can be obtained from an ultrarelativistic limit of Virasoro Verma
modules, while recalling why Galilean limits typically lead to non-unitary representations
of a diﬀerent kind.

3.1

bms3 algebra

The bms3 algebra is an inﬁnite-dimensional algebra spanned by superrotation generators
Jm and supermomentum generators Pm (m ∈ Z) whose Lie brackets read

[Jm, Jn] = (m − n)Jm+n +
[Jm, Pn] = (m − n)Pm+n +
[Pm, Pn] = 0 ,

c1
12
c2
12

m(m2 − 1) δm+n,0 ,
m(m2 − 1) δm+n,0 ,

(3.1a)

(3.1b)

(3.1c)

where c1 and c2 are central charges. The central charge c2 plays a key role for representa-
tion theory and it is e.g. non-vanishing in three-dimensional gravity [4], where it takes the
value c2 = 3
G with G being Newton’s constant. The Poincar´e algebra (2.1) is a subalgebra
of bms3. Similarly to (2.3), the bms3 algebra is the semi-direct sum

bms3 = vir Aad (vir)Ab

(3.2)

where vir denotes the Virasoro algebra. In contrast with Poincar´e, the operators (2.4)
and (2.5) no longer commute with all generators of the algebra.

To the best of our knowledge, the classiﬁcation of bms3 Casimir operators is unknown.
However, it was shown in [30] that the only Casimirs of the Virasoro algebra are functions
of its central charges. If one assumes that all bms3 Casimirs can be obtained as ﬂat limits
of Virasoro Casimirs (in the same way that the Poincar´e Casimirs can be seen as limits,
cf. (2.19)), then there are no bms3 Casimirs other than its central charges.

3.2

bms3 modules

Irreducible unitary representations of the BMS3 group are classiﬁed by orbits of supermo-
menta under the action of ﬁnite superrotations, that is, by coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro
group [19]. In analogy with the Poincar´e example, each orbit consists of supermomenta
obtained by acting with superrotations on a given supermomentum p. The latter is a
function on the circle,

pneinϕ ,

(3.3)

and can be interpreted, from the gravitational viewpoint, as the Bondi mass aspect asso-
ciated with an asymptotically ﬂat metric in three dimensions — i.e. the energy density
carried by the gravitational ﬁeld at null inﬁnity.
It transforms as a quadratic density

p(ϕ) =Xn∈Z

10

(or equivalently as a CFT stress tensor) under superrotations. The corresponding repre-
sentation is then obtained by assuming the existence of a (quasi-)invariant measure on
the orbit and by building a Hilbert space of square-integrable wavefunctionals on that
orbit [19]. This Hilbert space admits a basis of eigenstates of the operators Pm, which
generalise plane waves of deﬁnite momentum, and that we will denote as |p(ϕ), si. Here
s ∈ R is a spin label directly analogous to its Poincar´e counterpart; BMS3 representations
with identical supermomentum orbits but diﬀerent spins are mutually inequivalent.

Massive modules

An important class of representations is provided by supermomentum orbits that contain
a constant p(ϕ) = M − c2/24, where M > 0 is a mass parameter and c2 is the central
charge entering (3.1). This class contains e.g. the vacuum representation M = 0, that
accounts for all perturbative boundary excitations around the vacuum [20]. The Hilbert
space of any such representation contains a wavefunction |M, si that satisﬁes
J0|M, si = s|M, si ,

P0|M, si = M|M, si , Pm|M, si = 0 for m 6= 0 ,

(3.4)

i.e. which is a supermomentum eigenstate for the constant eigenvalue p(ϕ) = M − c2/24.
In analogy with (2.7), we will call |M, si the rest-frame state of the representation.

As in the Poincar´e case, (3.4) deﬁnes a one-dimensional representation of the subalgebra
of (3.1) spanned by {Pn, J0, c1, c2}. This representation can be used to deﬁne an induced
bms3 module HM with basis vectors

Jn1Jn2 · · · JnN|M, si ,

(3.5)

where the ni’s are non-zero integers such that n1 ≥ n2 ≥ ... ≥ nN . With this ordering,
states (3.5) with diﬀerent combinations of ni’s are linearly independent within the uni-
versal enveloping algebra of bms3, and acting on them from the left with the generators
of the algebra provides linear operators on HM whose commutators coincide with (3.1).
It is again unclear, however, how to deﬁne from scratch a scalar product on the space
spanned by (3.5). Without scalar product one cannot look for null states to identify
reducible modules, and the operators (2.4) and (2.5) can no longer be used to check
irreducibility. Analogously to Poincar´e, one can nevertheless consider the scalar product
inherited from the limit of representations of the conformal algebra or, more naturally,
reach a basis of supermomentum eigenstates. These states can be built (up to an irrelevant
phase) from the rest-frame wavefunctional as

|p(ϕ), si = U(ω)|M, si ,

(3.6)

11

where7

U(ω) = exp iXn∈Z∗

ωnJn! , with ω∗

n = ω−n

(3.7)

is a unitary operator implementing a ﬁnite superrotation. The complex coeﬃcients ωn
are the Fourier modes of a vector ﬁeld on the circle ω(ϕ)∂ϕ. One readily veriﬁes that the
semi-direct structure (3.2) implies that the states (3.6) are eigenstates of supermomentum.
Indeed, the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ formula yields

Pm|p(ϕ), si = U(cid:0)U −1PmU(cid:1) |M, si = U · exp (i adω) [Pm]|M, si ,

where Pn ωnJn acts on Pm according to the adjoint representation,

[ ωnJn, Pm ] .

adω[Pm] = Xn∈Z∗

(3.8)

(3.9)

The bracket (3.1b) then implies that U −1PmU is a certain combination of products of
Pm’s and central charges c2. This combination acts multiplicatively on the rest-frame
state thanks to conditions (3.4), from which we conclude as announced that U|M, si is
an eigenstate of supermomentum.

In fact we can even be more precise and say something about the eigenvalue of U|M, si
under Pm. (The complete argument is presented in appendix A, while here we only dis-
cuss its salient aspects.) By construction, supermomenta transform under superrotations
according to the coadjoint representation of the Virasoro group, which coincides with the
standard transformation law of CFT stress tensors under conformal transformations. Ex-
plicitly, a superrotation f (ϕ) (satisfying f (ϕ + 2π) = f (ϕ) + 2π) maps a supermomentum
p(ϕ) on a new supermomentum (f · p)(ϕ) given by

(f · p)(f (ϕ)) =

1

(f ′(ϕ))2 hp(ϕ) +

c2

12{f ; ϕ}i ,

(3.10)

where {f ; ϕ} is the Schwarzian derivative of f at ϕ. Accordingly we know that the super-
momentum of the state U(ω)|M, si takes the form (3.10) with p(ϕ) replaced by M−c2/24,
in which case the eigenvalue of U|M, si under Pm is the mth Fourier mode of f · p. The
diﬀeomorphism f is the exponential of the vector ﬁeld ω(ϕ)∂ϕ; in other words f is given
by the ﬂow of ω(ϕ)∂ϕ (see eq. (A.12) for the exact correspondence). This is, in principle at
least, the relation between the Fourier modes ωn and the corresponding ﬁnite diﬀeomor-
phism. It is the BMS3 analogue of the relation (2.9) that we displayed in the Poincar´e case.

7The exponential map from the Virasoro algebra to the Virasoro group is not locally surjective (see
e.g. [31]), so exponential operators such as (3.7) cannot map the rest-frame state |M, si on all other
plane waves in the supermomentum orbit. Nevertheless, superrotations do act transitively on the orbit:
(3.6) is always correct for some unitary operator U , although the latter cannot always be written as an
exponential (3.7). For the sake of simplicity, we assume that this subtlety does not aﬀect our arguments;
some additional comments can be found in appendix A.

12

The basis of plane waves |p(ϕ), si has the virtue of making BMS3 representations man-
ifestly unitary [19], since their scalar product takes the form (2.12). The only diﬀerence is
that now the measure µ is a path integral measure on a supermomentum orbit; such mea-
sures were shown to exist in [32]. In addition, this setup provides a simple argument for
showing that the representation is irreducible. Indeed, the supermomenta p(ϕ) of these
states span a superrotation orbit; the latter is a homogeneous space for the Virasoro
group, so any plane wave can be mapped on any other one thanks to a suitably chosen
superrotation. If we think of plane waves as a basis of the space of the representation,
then this property of transitivity implies that the space of the representation admits no
non-trivial invariant subspace, which is to say that the representation is irreducible. We
will also expose further arguments for irreducibility in sect. 3.3.

Vacuum module

The vacuum bms3 module can be characterised in a similar way, starting from a vacuum
state |0i such that

Pm|0i = 0 for all m ∈ Z and Jn|0i = 0 for n = −1, 0, 1.

(3.11)

Here the condition P0|0i = 0 says that the vacuum has zero mass, while the additional
conditions J±1|0i = 0 reﬂect Lorentz-invariance. They imply that the stability group of
the constant momentum p(ϕ) = M − c2/24 is enhanced for M = 0. In the language of
induced representations, this means that the little group of the vacuum is the Lorentz
group instead of the group of rotations.

If we were dealing with the Poincar´e algebra, such conditions would produce a trivial
representation. Here, by contrast, there exist non-trivial “boosted vacua” of the form
(3.5), where now n1, ..., nN are integers diﬀerent from −1, 0, 1. These vacua are analogous
to the boundary gravitons of AdS3 [33]. The fact that the vacuum is not invariant under
the full BMS symmetry, but only under its Poincar´e subgroup, implies that the boosted
states (3.5) (with all ni’s 6= −1, 0, 1) can be interpreted as Goldstone-like states associated
with broken symmetry generators. Equivalently each state (3.5) can be interpreted as a
vacuum dressed with the three-dimensional analogue of soft graviton degrees of freedom
created by superrotations.8 This also provides a natural interpretation for non-vacuum
BMS3 representations as particles dressed with soft gravitons. It should be noted that, in
contrast to the realistic four-dimensional case, supertranslations here do not create new
states.

8Since three-dimensional gravity has no local degrees of freedom, the notion of “soft graviton” is
ambiguous. (There are no genuine gravitons whose zero-frequency limit would be soft gravitons.) Our
viewpoint here is that “soft” degrees of freedom coincide with the boundary degrees of freedom deﬁned
by non-trivial asymptotic symmetries, in accordance with their relation to soft theorems [7].

3.3 Ultrarelativistic limit of Virasoro modules

In analogy with the discussion in sect. 2.3, bms3 modules emerge as limits of irreducible
unitary representations of the local conformal algebra, which are built as tensor products
of irreducible Verma modules of the Virasoro algebra. We still denote the generators of
the local conformal algebra by two sets of commuting Lm and ¯Lm as in (2.14), but now
m ∈ Z and the generators obey the centrally extended algebra

[Lm,Ln] = (m − n) Lm+n +
[ ¯Lm, ¯Ln] = (m − n) ¯Lm+n +

c
12
¯c
12

m(m2 − 1)δm+n,0 ,
m(m2 − 1)δm+n,0 .

(3.12b)
Highest weight representations of this algebra are built upon an eigenstate |h, ¯hi of L0
and ¯L0 that satisﬁes

(3.12a)

(3.13)

¯Ln|h, ¯hi = 0 when n > 0 .
The carrier space of the representation is then spanned by the states

Ln|h, ¯hi = 0 ,

(3.14)
with n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nk > 0 and a similar ordering for the ¯ni > 0. As suggested by
the analysis in sect. 2.3, we will be interested in large values of h and ¯h, for which these
representations are irreducible. In addition the standard hermiticity condition

L−n1 · · ·L−nk

¯L−¯n1 · · · ¯L−¯nl|h, ¯hi

yields a scalar product on this space, allowing one to discuss unitarity.

(Lm)† = L−m

(3.15)

As for the Poincar´e case, one can deﬁne the new generators (2.17) and rewrite this
vector space in the basis (3.5), where M and s are the eigenvalues of P0 and J0 related to
h and ¯h by (2.21). The change of basis is again invertible because no Jn annihilates the
vacuum. Each representation of the conformal algebra is still speciﬁed by an analogue of
(2.23), where now each state is labelled by the quantum numbers ni, ¯nj and the matrices
P(n) and J(n) also depend on the central charges c1 and c2 deﬁned by

c1 = c − ¯c ,

c2 =

c + ¯c

ℓ

.

(3.16)

As before, only negative powers of ℓ enter P(n) via the highest-weight conditions (3.13)
written in the new basis:

(cid:18)P±n ±

1
ℓ

J±n(cid:19)|h, ¯hi = 0 .

(3.17)
A limit ℓ → ∞ performed at ﬁxed M, s and c1, c2 (rather than e.g. at ﬁxed h, ¯h) then
gives the bms3 module that we built from scratch in sect. 3.2. Note, in particular, that
the highest-weight state (3.13) is mapped to the rest-frame state (3.4) in this limit. In
this sense a bms3 module is just a high-energy limit of the tensor product of two Virasoro
modules. Since Virasoro representations are irreducible for large h, it is reasonable to
expect that the same is true of bms3 modules.

14

3.4 Galilean limit of Virasoro modules

In this section we consider another possible group contraction, to be interpreted as a non-
relativistic limit of the conformal symmetry. This limiting procedure yields an inﬁnite-
dimensional extension of the Galilean algebra known as Galilean conformal algebra or gca2
(see e.g. [25]), which is isomorphic to bms3. In spite of the algebras being isomorphic, the
representations that one obtains in the ultrarelativistic or Galilean limits are signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent. In particular, the Galilean contraction we are going to review generically leads
to non-unitary representations [25].

As in the previous section, the generators Ln and ¯Ln satisfy the algebra (3.12), and
we consider Virasoro highest-weight representations as in (3.13). In order to perform the
nonrelativistic limit we introduce a dimensionless contraction parameter ǫ and the new
generators

(3.18)
We stress that the combinations of Lm’s appearing in this deﬁnition are diﬀerent from
those of the ultrarelativistic contraction (2.17). In this basis the conformal algebra reads

Mn ≡ ǫ(cid:0) ¯Ln − Ln(cid:1) ,

Ln ≡ ¯Ln + Ln .

[Lm, Ln] = (m − n) Lm+n +
[Lm, Mn] = (m − n) Mm+n +
[Mm, Mn] = ǫ2(cid:16)(m − n) Lm+n +

m(m2 − 1) δm+n,0 ,
m(m2 − 1) δm+n,0 ,
cL
m(m2 − 1) δm+n,0(cid:17) ,
12

cL
12
cM
12

where the central charges are given by

cM = ǫ (¯c − c) .
In the limit ǫ → 0 one obtains an algebra isomorphic to (3.1).

cL = ¯c + c ,

We denote the eigenvalues of M0 and L0 on a highest-weight state |h, ¯hi by

∆ = ¯h + h ,

ξ = ǫ(cid:0)¯h − h(cid:1) ,

(3.19a)

(3.19b)

(3.19c)

(3.20)

(3.21)

and we use them to label the state as |∆, ξi. In terms of the operators (3.18) the highest-
weight conditions (3.13) become

Ln|∆, ξi = 0 ,

Mn|∆, ξi = 0 , n > 0 .

(3.22)

Note that these constraints hold for any value of ǫ, including the limit ǫ → 0. One can
then consider the descendant states

|{li},{mj}i = L−l1 . . . L−liM−m1 . . . M−mj|∆, ξi ,

(3.23)

with l1 ≥ . . . ≥ li > 0 and m1 ≥ . . . ≥ mj > 0, and compute the matrix elements of the op-
erators Mn and Ln in this basis, by using the commutators (3.19). Only positive powers of

15

ǫ2 appear due to (3.19c), while in contrast to the ultrarelativistic case the highest-weight
conditions (3.22) do not bring any power of ǫ. The matrix elements also depend on the
central charges cL and cM of (3.20). In the limit ǫ → 0 at ∆, ξ, cL and cM ﬁxed one ﬁnds
the same matrix elements that one would obtain by working directly with the gca2 algebra.

We stress that the highest-weight conditions (3.22) signiﬁcantly diﬀer from the rest-
frame conditions (3.13) that we obtained in the ultrarelativistic limit. Consequently, the
corresponding representations have very diﬀerent features. In the Galilean case one can
readily deﬁne a scalar product by imposing the hermiticity conditions (Mm)† = M−m and
(Lm)† = L−m. This allows one to compute h{li},{mj}|{lk},{ml}i by taking advantage of
(3.22). One realises in this way that, in contrast with bms3 modules, these representations
are typically reducible and non-unitary [25].

4 Higher-spin modules in ﬂat space

We now turn to the higher-spin analogue of the algebraic constructions described above.
For concreteness and simplicity we focus on the spin-3 extension of bms3 but our consid-
erations apply, mutatis mutandis, to other higher-spin extensions as well. We will start by
deﬁning the quantum ﬂat W3 algebra as an ultrarelativistic limit of W3 ⊕ W3, which will
produce a speciﬁc ordering of operators in the non-linear terms of the commutators. Sect.
4.2 will then be devoted to the construction of induced modules along the lines described
above for Poincar´e and bms3, and we will see there that the ordering that emerges in the
ultrarelativistic limit may be seen as a normal ordering with respect to rest-frame con-
ditions. Along the way we will compare our results to those of the non-relativistic limit
described in [26], and we will see that the two limits lead to diﬀerent quantum algebras.

4.1 Spin-3 extension of the bms3 algebra

One can add to the bms3 algebra two sets of generators Wn and Qn that transform under
superrotations as the modes of primary ﬁelds of conformal weight 3. This gives a non-
linear algebra that can be obtained as an ˙In¨on¨u-Wigner contraction of the direct sum of
two W3 algebras. This contraction has been discussed at the semiclassical level in [14,15]
and a Galilean limit of the quantum algebra has been considered in [26]. Here we are
interested instead in an ultrarelativistic limit of W3 ⊕ W3. The key diﬀerence between
the Galilean and ultrarelativistic contractions is that the latter mixes generators with
positive and negative mode numbers, whereas the former does not. For linear algebras,
such as the Virasoro algebra for example, this does not pose a problem and thus the
two contractions yield isomorphic algebras. As soon as non-linear algebras are involved
in the contraction, however, Galilean and ultrarelativistic limits do not necessarily yield
isomorphic (quantum) algebras anymore.

Ultrarelativistic contraction

The quantum W3 algebra is spanned by two sets of generators Lm and Wm (m ∈ Z)
whose commutation relations read

[Lm, Ln] = (m − n) Lm+n +

The standard hermiticity conditions on the generators of this algebra are

(Wm)† = W−m

(4.1a)

(4.1b)

(4.1c)

(4.2)

(4.3)

together with (3.15); these conditions must hold in any unitary representation of the W3
algebra.

We consider a direct sum W3 ⊕ W3 where the generators and the central charge of
the other copy of W3 will be denoted with a bar on top ( ¯Lm, ¯Wm and ¯c). Introducing a
length scale ℓ (to be interpreted as the AdS3 radius), we deﬁne new generators Pm and
Jm as in (2.17) together with

Wm ≡ Wm − ¯W−m,

Qm ≡

(4.4)

1

ℓ (cid:0)Wm + ¯W−m(cid:1) .

We also deﬁne central charges c1 and c2 as in (3.16). In the limit ℓ → ∞, and provided
the central charges scale in such a way that both c1 and c2 be ﬁnite, one ﬁnds that Jm
and Pm satisfy the brackets (3.1) and

[Jm, Wn] = (2m − n)Wm+n ,
[Pm, Wn] = (2m − n)Qm+n ,

[Jm, Qn] = (2m − n)Qm+n ,
[Pm, Qn] = 0 .

(4.6)

One can check that with this deﬁnition the algebra (3.1), (4.5) satisﬁes Jacobi identities.
We will call this algebra the (quantum) ﬂat W3 algebra. In any unitary representation,
its generators satisfy the hermiticity conditions

(Qm)† = Q−m ,

(Wm)† = W−m .

(4.7)

supplemented with (2.2) for m ∈ Z.

The expressions (4.6) for the quadratic terms follow from the identities

(4.8a)

(4.8b)

Note, in particular, that both the linear term in (4.2) and the mixing between positive
and negative modes in (2.17)-(4.4) are necessary to reorganize the sum of quadratic terms
with the precise order of (4.6). We shall see in sect. 4.2 that (4.6) can be considered as a
normal-ordered polynomial with respect to our deﬁnition of the vacuum.

Galilean contraction

By contrast, a Galilean contraction of W3⊕W3 can be obtained by deﬁning central charges
cL and cM as in (3.20), introducing new generators Mm and Lm as in (3.18) and writing

Qm ≡ ǫ(cid:0) ¯Wm − Wm(cid:1) ,

Wm ≡ ¯Wm + Wm .

(4.9)

In the limit ǫ → 0 one obtains brackets of the same form as in (4.5) after the substitutions
Jm → Lm, Pm → Mm and c1 → cL, c2 → cM . However, there are two important

18

diﬀerences: the coeﬃcient in front of Θm+n in (4.5c) contains a shifted central charge
cL + 44/5 and the quadratic terms read

(4.10a)

(4.10b)

(see eq. (2.18) of [26]). They can be interpreted as normal-ordered operators with respect
to a highest-weight vacuum deﬁned by conditions of the type (3.22) with ∆ = ξ = 0.
These diﬀerences show that the two contractions lead to diﬀerent quantum algebras, de-
spite the fact that the corresponding classical algebras coincide.10 Thus, in the presence
of higher-spin ﬁelds, the diﬀerence between ultrarelativistic and Galilean limits manifests
itself directly in the symmetry algebras and not only at the level of the representations
surviving in the limit.

In the following we restrict our attention to irreducible unitary representations of the
ultrarelativistic quantum algebra (4.5), built once again according to the induced module
prescription. On the other hand, highest-weight representations of Galilean contractions
of two copies of non-linear W algebras were discussed in [26], where it was shown that
unitary representations with higher-spin states do not exist.

4.2 Flat W3 modules

The non-linearities in (4.5) make standard group-theoretic techniques inapplicable to the
construction of representations of the ﬂat W3 algebra. In spite of this limitation, it was
suggested in [22] that unitary irreducible representations can be built as Hilbert spaces
of wavefunctionals deﬁned on orbits of extended supermomenta

p(ϕ) =Xn∈Z

pneinϕ ,

q(ϕ) =Xn∈Z

qneinϕ ,

(4.11)

where p(ϕ) is the Bondi mass aspect/supermomentum already introduced in (3.3), while
q(ϕ) is its spin-3 analogue. The latter is a function on the circle transforming as a cubic
density (or equivalently as a current of spin 3) under superrotations. In analogy with the
bms3 case, we will further assume that the Hilbert space of wavefunctionals on a given
orbit admits a basis of eigenstates of Pm, Qm, denoted by |p(ϕ), q(ϕ)i, where for brevity
we omitted the spin labels (such as s in (3.4)) that are ﬁxed in any given irreducible

10An interesting problem is to understand if these algebras are merely diﬀerent because of an unfortu-
nate choice of basis, or if they are genuinely distinct in the sense that they are not isomorphic. We will
not address this issue here.

19

representation. This proposal was tested in [22], for arbitrary spin, by matching suitable
products of one-loop higher-spin partition functions with group characters derived using
the Frobenius formula that follows from the orbit construction. In the remainder of this
section we investigate the algebraic counterpart of that proposal.

Massive modules

We focus on orbits that contain a constant extended supermomentum p(ϕ) = M − c2/24,
q(ϕ) = q0. The Hilbert space of the corresponding representation then contains a plane
wave state |M, q0i that satisﬁes

Pm|M, q0i = 0 ,

Qm|M, q0i = 0

for m 6= 0 ,

and is an eigenstate of zero-mode charges:

P0|M, q0i = M|M, q0i ,
Q0|M, q0i = q0|M, q0i ,

J0|M, q0i = s|M, q0i ,
W0|M, q0i = w|M, q0i .

(4.12a)

(4.12b)

(4.12c)

Here M and s are the mass and spin labels encountered earlier, while q0 and w are their
spin-3 counterparts. As before we will call |M, q0i the rest-frame state of the representa-
tion.

The conditions (4.12) deﬁne a one-dimensional representation of the subalgebra spanned
by {Pm, Qm, J0, W0}. They can be used to deﬁne an induced module HM,q0 with basis
elements
(4.13)
where k1 ≥ · · · ≥ km and l1 ≥ · · · ≥ ln are non-zero integers. This provides an explicit
representation of the quantum ﬂat W3 algebra. Note that the presence of non-linearities
in the commutators (4.5) does not aﬀect the construction of the induced module, which
involves the universal enveloping algebra anyway.

Wk1 · · · WkmJl1 · · · Jln|M, q0i ,

As in the previous examples, the basis (4.13) is very useful to prove the existence of a
given representation, but not very illuminating if one wants to understand its properties.
Following our mantra, we thus move to a basis of eigenstates of supermomentum by acting
on the rest-frame state as

|p(ϕ), q(ϕ)i = U(ω, Ω)|M, q0i ,

where

U(ω, Ω) = exp iXn∈Z∗

(ωnJn + ΩnWn)! with ω∗

n = ω−n, Ω∗

n = Ω−n

(4.14)

(4.15)

is a unitary operator implementing a ﬁnite higher-spin superrotation. The complex co-
eﬃcients ωn and Ωn can be interpreted as the Fourier modes of the tensor ﬁelds ω(ϕ)∂ϕ

20

and Ω(ϕ)∂ϕ∂ϕ on the circle.

To prove that the states (4.14) diagonalise all Pm’s and Qm’s we can use the Baker-

Campbell-Hausdorﬀ formula as in (3.8) to obtain

(4.16a)

(4.16b)

(4.17)

Pm|p(ϕ), q(ϕ)i = U · exp (i adω,Ω) [Pm]|M, q0i ,
Qn|p(ϕ), q(ϕ)i = U · exp (i adω,Ω) [Qn]|M, q0i ,

where

adω,Ω[· ] = Xn∈Z∗

[ ωnJn + ΩnWn, · ] .

Inspection of (4.5) then shows that the nested commutators that appear in (4.16) always
produce either Pn or Qn modes. As a result the right-hand sides of (4.16) turn into series
of products of Pn and Qn operators, which act diagonally on the rest-frame state by virtue
of the rest-frame conditions (4.12). Computing the eigenvalue associated with a given set
of modes ωn and Ωn requires instead a control of the ﬁnite action of W3 superrotations,
that was discussed e.g. in [34].

As before the plane waves (4.14) provide an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space of
the representation, thus making unitarity manifest (provided a suitable measure exists on
the orbit). Irreducibility can be inferred from the same argument we used for bms3: by
construction, a supermomentum orbit is a homogeneous space for the action of superrota-
tions, and this carries over to the higher-spin setting. This implies that W3 superrotations
can map any plane wave state on any other one, which in turn implies that the space of
the representation has no non-trivial invariant subspace.

Vacuum module

The vacuum module of the ﬂat W3 algebra can be built in direct analogy to its bms3
counterpart discussed around (3.11). The only subtlety is the enhancement of the little
group, which leads to additional conditions on superrotations. Indeed the vacuum state
|0i is now an eigenstate of all modes Pm and Qm with zero eigenvalue, and satisﬁes in
addition

Jn|0i = 0 for n = −1, 0, 1, Wm|0i = 0 for m = −2,−1, 0, 1, 2.

(4.18)

These conditions ensure that the vacuum is invariant under the sl(3, R) wedge algebra of
the W3 subalgebra (which includes in particular the Lorentz algebra). The corresponding
module can then be built as usual by acting with higher-spin superrotation generators
on the vacuum state and producing states of the form (4.13), where now all li’s must be
diﬀerent from −1, 0, 1 and all ki’s must be diﬀerent from −2,−1, 0, 1, 2.

21

The deﬁnition of the ﬂat W3 vacuum allows us to interpret the quadratic terms in
(4.6) as being normal-ordered. Indeed, the expectation value of the operators Θn and Λn
vanishes on the vacuum |0i:

h0|Θn|0i = h0|Λn|0i = 0.

(4.19)

By contrast, for a highest-weight vacuum of the type (3.22) one obtains non-vanishing
expectation values. Thus the additional non-linear structure introduced by higher spins
stresses once more that the natural representations to be considered in the ultrarelativistic
limit are the induced ones discussed above, rather than the highest-weight ones of [25,26].

These considerations appear to be a robust feature of “ﬂat W algebras”. Ultrarela-

tivistic contractions of WN ⊕ WN algebras always take the form

“ﬂat WN ” = WN Aad (WN )Ab

(4.20)

and therefore contain an Abelian ideal. In addition the structure constants of the non-
linear terms are always proportional to inverse powers of the central charge. Indeed, for
a non-linear operator of nth order the structure constants for large c are proportional to
1
cn−1 . When expanding them in powers of the contraction parameter ℓ, this implies that
the leading term is proportional to ℓ1−n thanks to (3.16).
In order to obtain a ﬁnite
result, it is thus necessary that the resulting non-linear operator consists of at least n− 1
Abelian generators. Terms of this kind always have a vanishing expectation value on our
rest-frame vacuum, although the precise ordering in the polynomial should be ﬁxed by
other means, e.g. by deﬁning the algebra via a contraction of the quantum algebra or by
imposing Jacobi identities.

5 Conclusion

In this work we have seen how induced representations of groups can be recovered from
induced modules of Lie algebras. When applied to bms3 and its higher-spin extensions,
this approach conﬁrms and expands the prescription previously described in [22]. Each
such module consists of a rest-frame state and of its “descendants” obtained by acting
with all superrotation generators. It provides an explicit irreducible unitary representa-
tion of the corresponding symmetry algebra. It can also be seen as a high-energy, high
central charge limit of highest weight representations of direct sums of Virasoro or W
algebras.

This approach has also allowed us to discuss the diﬀerences between ultrarelativistic
and Galilean limits of Virasoro/W representations. As argued above, the ultrarelativis-
tic limit always produces unitary induced modules, while the Galilean limit generically
produces non-unitary highest-weight representations. In fact, higher-spin considerations

22

allow us to see this dichotomy already at the level of Lie algebras, regardless of repre-
sentation theory: the ultrarelativistic limit of the quantum W3 ⊕ W3 algebra produces
non-linear terms of the type (4.6), which are normal-ordered with respect to the rest-
frame conditions adapted to induced modules. By contrast, its Galilean limit leads to
terms such as (4.10), which are not normal-ordered with respect to rest-frame conditions,
but are indeed normal-ordered with respect to the highest-weight conditions of [26]. We
stress that this diﬀerence is a genuine quantum higher-spin eﬀect: it is not apparent at
the classical level, and it does not appear in pure gravity either.

The diﬀerence between ultrarelativistic and Galilean limits also emphasizes their phys-
ical distinction: the ultrarelativistic limit is adapted to gravity, and more generally to
models of fundamental interactions, where unitarity is a crucial requirement. In particu-
lar, ﬂat space holography (at least in the framework of Einstein gravity) should rely on
the unitary construction of [19,20], as conﬁrmed in [35,22] by the matching between group
characters and one-loop partition functions. By contrast, the Galilean viewpoint is suited
to condensed matter applications and, more generally, to situations where unitarity need
not hold — as was indeed argued in [25].

A Superrotations and supermomenta

In this appendix we revisit the arguments surrounding (3.10) according to which supermo-
menta transform under superrotations as Virasoro coadjoint vectors. We also display the
exact relation between a vector ﬁeld ω(ϕ)∂ϕ representing an inﬁnitesimal superrotation,
and its exponential.

23

A.1 Action of superrotations on supermomenta

We consider a state |p(ϕ), si and act on it with a superrotation f using a unitary oper-
ator U[f ]. (The discussion below (3.6) is recovered upon taking |p(ϕ), si = |M, si and
f = exp[ω], but our argument will be independent of these details.) We wish to show
that the state U[f ]|p(ϕ), si is an eigenstate of supermomentum whose eigenvalues are the
Fourier modes of the supermomentum f · p, where the dot denotes the coadjoint repre-
sentation (3.10).

We start by combining the generators Pm in a “quantum supermomentum”

P (ϕ) ≡ Xm∈Z

Pmeimϕ

and act with it on the state U[f ]|p(ϕ), si. We ﬁnd

(A.1)

(A.2)

P (ϕ)U[f ]|p(ϕ), si = U[f ](cid:0)U[f ]−1P (ϕ)U[f ](cid:1) |p(ϕ), si .

Now recall how the supermomentum generators Pm are deﬁned: a supertranslation α is
represented by a unitary operator

U[α] = exp(cid:20) i

2πZ 2π

0

dϕ α(ϕ)P (ϕ)(cid:21)

so we have

P (ϕ) = −2πi

δ

δα(ϕ)

(U[α])|α=0

(A.3)

(A.4)

and the deﬁnition of Pm follows after taking the mth Fourier mode of this expression.
Now, plugging this deﬁnition in (A.2) we get

P (ϕ)U[f ]|p(ϕ), si = −2πi

= −2πi

δ

δα(ϕ)

δ

δα(ϕ)

U[f ](cid:0)U[f ]−1U[α]U[f ](cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)α=0 |p(ϕ), si

U[f ] (U[σf −1 α])|α=0 |p(ϕ), si

(A.5)

where σ denotes the adjoint representation of the Virasoro group. In writing this we have
used the group operation of BMS3,

(f, α) · (g, β) = (f ◦ g, α + σf β) .

(A.6)

Now using (A.3) we ﬁnd

U[σf −1 α] = exp(cid:20) i

2πZ 2π

0

dϕ (σf −1α)(ϕ)P (ϕ)(cid:21) = exp(cid:20) i

2πZ 2π

0

dϕ α(ϕ)(σ∗

f P )(ϕ)(cid:21) (A.7)

24

where σ∗ is the dual representation corresponding to σ and thus coincides with the coad-
joint representation of the Virasoro group. Plugging this in (A.5) and taking the functional
derivative we ﬁnally ﬁnd

P (ϕ)U[f ]|p(ϕ), si = U[f ](σ∗

f P )(ϕ)|p(ϕ), si .
Since |p(ϕ), si is an eigenstate of supermomentum, it follows that
f p)(ϕ)U[f ]|p(ϕ), si

P (ϕ)U[f ]|p(ϕ), si = (σ∗

(A.8)

(A.9)

which was to be proven.

A.2 Exponential superrotations

As mentioned in footnote 7, the exponential map of the Virasoro group is not locally
surjective. Nevertheless one can consider superrotations given by exponentials of vector
ﬁelds as in (3.7). It is then natural to ask what is the explicit form of the diﬀeomorphism
f = exp[ω] generated by a vector ﬁeld ω = ω(ϕ)∂ϕ.

As mentioned below (3.10) the relation between f and ω is given by the ﬂow of the
latter. Explicitly, ω deﬁnes a family of integral curves, which are paths ϕ(t) on the circle
that satisfy the diﬀerential equation

dϕ(t)

dt

= ω(ϕ(t)).

(A.10)

Given an initial condition ϕ(0) = ϕ0, the solution of this equation is unique; this deﬁnes
a one-parameter family of diﬀeomorphisms ft such that

ft(ϕ0) = ϕ(t)

(A.11)

In particular, by deﬁnition of the exponential map, the
and known as the ﬂow of ω.
diﬀeomorphism f = exp[ω] generated by ω is just f = f1, that is, the ﬂow evaluated at
time t = 1. Using the evolution equation (A.10) this can also be restated as the condition

Z f (ϕ0)

ϕ0

dϕ
ω(ϕ)

= 1,

(A.12)

required to hold for any ϕ0 on the circle. This is the exact correspondence between a
superrotation generator ω and its exponential f = exp[ω]. Note that (A.12) automatically
ensures f (ϕ0 + 2π) = f (ϕ0) + 2π, in accordance with the fact that f is a diﬀeomorphism
of the circle.
