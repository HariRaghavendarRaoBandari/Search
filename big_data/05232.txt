THE MERGING GALAXY CLUSTER A520 — A BROKEN-UP COOL CORE, A DARK SUBCLUSTER, AND AN X-RAY

CHANNEL

ABSTRACT

We present results from a deep Chandra X-ray observation of a merging galaxy cluster A520. A high-resolution
gas temperature map, after the subtraction of the cluster-scale emission, reveals a long trail of dense, cool
clumps — apparently the fragments of a cool core that has been completely stripped from the infalling subclus-
ter by ram pressure. In this scenario, we can assume that the clumps are still connected by the magnetic ﬁeld
lines. The observed temperature variations imply that thermal conductivity is suppressed by a factor > 100
across the presumed direction of the magnetic ﬁeld (as found in other clusters), and is also suppressed along
the ﬁeld lines by a factor of several. Two massive clumps in the periphery of A520, visible in the weak lensing
mass map and the X-ray image, have apparently been completely stripped of gas during the merger, but then
re-accreted the surrounding high-entropy gas upon exit from the cluster. An X-ray hydrostatic mass estimate
for one of the clumps (that has simple geometry) agrees with the lensing mass. Its current gas mass to total mass
ratio is very low, 1.5–3%, which makes it a “dark subcluster”. We also found a curious low X-ray brightness
channel (likely a low-density sheet in projection) going across the cluster along the direction of an apparent
secondary merger. The channel may be caused by plasma depletion in a region of an ampliﬁed magnetic ﬁeld
(with plasma β ∼ 10 − 20). The shock in A520 will be studied in a separate paper.

1. INTRODUCTION

Galaxy clusters form and grow via mergers of less massive
systems in a hierarchical process governed by gravity (e.g.,
Press & Schechter 1974; Springel et al. 2006). In the course
of each merger, approximately speaking, the kinetic energy
carried by the gas of the colliding clusters dissipates into ther-
mal energy via shocks and turbulence and, in the absence of
further disturbances, the hotter gas comes into approximate
hydrostatic equilibrium with the deeper gravitational potential
of the resulting bigger cluster (e.g., Bahcall & Sarazin 1977)
on a ∼Gyr timescale. What happens during that Gigayear of
violent gas motions is very interesting, because it can illumi-
nate several aspects of the physics of the intracluster plasma
(e.g., Markevitch & Vikhlinin 2007). Ram pressure of the gas
ﬂows may strip the subclusters of their gas (e.g., Clowe et al.
2006) and disturb and even destroy their cool cores either di-
rectly (e.g., Fabian & Daines 1991; Markevitch et al. 2000)
or by facilitating mixing with the surrounding gas (ZuHone
et al. 2010). Temperature gradients in the gas generated by
shock heating and mixing of different gas phases should be
quickly erased by thermal conduction, if it is not suppressed
(e.g., Markevitch et al. 2003b; Eckert et al. 2012). All of this
makes observations of merging clusters in the X-ray, where
we can map the density and temperature of the hot intraclus-
ter plasma, extremely interesting.
The hot (T (cid:39) 7 keV, Govoni et al. 2004) galaxy cluster
Abell 520 at z = 0.203 is one of only a handful of merging
systems with a shock front clearly visible in the sky plane
(Markevitch et al. 2005), which makes the merger geometry
quite unambiguous. The cluster has a detailed map of the pro-

jected total mass distribution derived from weak gravitational
lensing data (Mahdavi et al. 2007; Okabe & Umetsu 2008; Jee
et al. 2012; Clowe et al. 2012; Jee et al. 2014). We show an
uncropped version of the mass map from Clowe et al. (2012),
provided by D. Clowe (private communication), in Fig. 1c.
While the above authors disagree on the details (in particu-
lar, Mahdavi et al. and Jee et al. reported the presence of a
“dark clump” with an anomalously high M/L ratio in the mid-
dle of the cluster, marked by a green cross in Fig. 1c, while
Clowe et al. contested its statistical signiﬁcance), the lens-
ing maps agree qualitatively quite well. The overall picture
is a “train wreck” of several mass clumps mostly aligned in a
chain along the NE-SW direction. This is consistent with the
merger direction indicated by the X-ray shock front.

In this paper, we analyze in detail an extra-deep 0.5 Ms
Chandra observation of A520.
It will allow us to gain in-
sights into many of the above physical processes, such as the
cool core stripping and the suppression of thermal conduc-
tivity. Analysis of the shock front based on the same X-ray
data, supplemented by the archival radio data, will be given
in a future paper (Wang, Giacintucci, & Markevitch 2016, in
prep.).

We assume a ﬂat cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1
and Ωm = 0.3, in which 1(cid:48)(cid:48) is 3.34 kpc at z = 0.203. Errors are
quoted at 90% conﬁdence in text, and at 1-σ in ﬁgures, unless
otherwise stated.

2. X-RAY DATA ANALYSIS

A520 was observed with Chandra Advanced CCD Imag-
ing Spectrometer (ACIS) between December 2007 and Jan-
uary 2008 for a total of 447 ks (ObsIDs 9424, 9425,
9426, 9430). We reprocessed Level=1 event ﬁles using
acis_process_events of the Chandra X-ray Center
(CXC) software, CIAO (4.6).4 We applied the standard event

emission on the ACIS-I chips (a circle of r = 7(cid:48) centered on
A520 and another circle of r = 1.5(cid:48) on a small extended source
to the SW). Time bins of 1 ks were used, and bins whose count
rates were more than 20% different from the mean value were

discarded, resulting in 423 ks of total clean exposure. During
the clean exposure, no gradual changes in the quiescent back-
ground level were apparent during any of the observations;
the mean rates varied with time by less than 10%. We also
checked that there was no time variability in the ratio of the
2.5–7 keV to 9.5–12 keV counts using time bins of 10 ks. The
mean value of this ratio was also in good agreement (within
2%) of that in the blank-sky background dataset. The latter
two checks ensure the absence of faint residual background

artifact was modeled

The ACIS

readout

To create ﬂux images, exposure maps were created using
Alexey Vikhlinin’s tools.6 The exposure maps account for the
position- and energy-dependent variation in effective area and
detector efﬁciency. The exposure maps for different observa-
tions were co-added in sky coordinates. Then, the co-added
background-subtracted counts images were divided by the to-
tal exposure map to produce a ﬂux image. The four obser-
vations of A520 were set up with small relative offsets in the
sky to minimize the effect of chip gaps on the ﬁnal total im-
age. We excluded point sources found in the 0.8–4 keV and
2–7 keV images.

2.1. Sky background

To model the detector and sky background, we used the
ACIS blank-sky background dataset from the corresponding
epoch (“period E”) as described in Markevitch et al. (2003b)
and Hickox & Markevitch (2006). The VFAINT mode ﬁl-
ter was applied; the events were projected to the sky for each
observation using make_acisbg.7 The count rate derived
from the data was then scaled so that it had the same 9.5–
12 keV counts as the observed data. This was further reduced
by 1.32% to accommodate the amount of background con-
tained in the readout artifact. For ﬂux images, this was done
by multiplying the background counts image by a rescaling
factor. For spectral analysis, this was effected by setting the
BACKSCAL keyword in the spectra FITS ﬁles.

After subtracting the blank-sky and readout artifact back-
grounds, the spectrum of the cluster-free background region
revealed a small positive residual ﬂux mostly at E ∼ 2 keV in.
Some residual (positive or negative) is expected, as the soft
CXB varies across the sky and the blank-sky dataset comes
from other regions of the sky. We modeled this residual in the
0.5–9 keV band with an empirical spectral model consisting
of two APEC components, a power law and a Gaussian. The
thermal components were set to temperatures of 0.2 keV and
0.4 keV and their normalizations were allowed to vary, based
on the study of the soft CXB (Markevitch et al. 2003a). The
Gaussian component best ﬁt was at E = 0.9 keV with a zero
width. The power law component was added to account for
the residuals above 2 keV, and it was found that a photon index
of 0.6 made a qualitative improvement. Of course, there is no
physical signiﬁcance to this empirical model, as it describes
a difference between the true CXB (and possibly a very faint
residual ﬂare emission) and the CXB components included in
the blank-sky dataset. An alternative is to use the “stowed”
ACIS background dataset, which contains only the detector
background, and add physically-motivated CXB components.
However, the available stowed background dataset has a much
shorter exposure than the blank-sky dataset, which is critically
important for our extra-deep A520 observation. We assumed
that our empirical residual background was constant across
the FOV (before the telescope vignetting), and included this
model, adjusted for sky area and exposure time, when doing

spectral ﬁts for the cluster regions. For the narrow-band ﬂux
images, the residual was accounted for by subtracting a con-
stant value such that the ﬂux in the background region was
zero. A520 is sufﬁciently small and there is enough cluster-
free area within the FOV to make this additional background
modeling step possible.

2.2. Spectral analysis

The instrument responses for spectral analysis were gen-
erated as described in Vikhlinin et al. (2005). We used
the CHAV tool runextrspec to generate the PHA, ARF
and RMF ﬁles for each pointings. The PHA ﬁles (observed
data, blank-sky background and readout background) were
co-added using addspec from FTOOLS package. The
addarf and addrmf from FTOOLS were used to add ARFs
and RMFs. They were weighed by 0.5–2 keV counts in the
applicable spectral extraction region.

Spectral analysis was performed in XSPEC (version
12.8.2). A single-temperature ﬁt
to the cluster in a 3(cid:48)
circle (0.6 Mpc) centered on soft band ﬂux centroid at
(α, δ)=(04:54:09.7, +02:55:25) (FK5, J2000) gives T = 8.3±
0.3 keV, metal abundance 0.21± 0.02 (relative to Anders &
Grevesse 1989) and absorption column NH = (6.3 ± 0.7) ×
1020 cm−2. Factored into the error are formal error from ﬁt-
ting, effect of the modeled soft residual background and the
3% uncertainty of the blank-sky background (§2.1); these
were added in quadrature. We ﬁtted all spectra in the 0.8–
9 keV band, excluding the 1.7–1.9 keV and 7.3–7.6 keV in-
tervals that are occasionally affected by the detector features.
The best-ﬁt Galactic NH is consistent with 5.7 × 1020 cm−2
from the LAB survey (Kalberla et al. 2005). With NH ﬁxed at
the LAB value, we obtain T = 8.5±0.3 keV, while abundance

chose to use our best-ﬁt value of NH in order to compensate
for any inaccuracies in the calibration of the time-dependent
ACIS low-energy response (while our choice of the 0.8 keV
lower energy cutoff should minimize their effect). We also
ﬁxed the abundance at its best-ﬁt value.

3. TEMPERATURE MAPS

Temperature maps shown in Fig. 2 were derived following
the method described in Markevitch et al. (2000). We ex-
tracted 6 narrow band ﬂux images between 0.8–9 keV, exclud-
ing the 1.7–1.9 keV edge and 7.3–7.6 keV (possibly affected
by poor subtraction of the instrumental lines). Both ﬂux and
error images were smoothed prior to deriving the temperature
map. A single temperature MEKAL model was then ﬁtted to
a set of 6 ﬂux values from each pixel of the image, resulting
in a smoothed temperature map. The absorption column and
metal abundance were ﬁxed to the cluster best ﬁt values. Two
smoothing methods were used, as described below.

3.1. Smoothing with variable-width Gaussian kernel

For this approach, the narrow-band images were smoothed
using a Gaussian kernel whose width at each image pixel
is determined by surface brightness in the 0.8–4 keV band,
with the goal of preserving detail in bright regions. As a
reference for this smoothing method — but also as a high-
quality X-ray image that shows the cluster structure on all
scales and omits point sources — we used wavelet reconstruc-
tion of the 0.8–4 keV image, as described in Vikhlinin et al.
(1998). We derived it using Alexey Vikhlinin’s wvdecomp

tool in ZHTOOLS.8 We extracted wavelet components (with
the atrous kernel and scales increasing in geometric progres-
sion) on scales of 53, 105, 210 and 420 kpc (or 15.7(cid:48)(cid:48), 31.5(cid:48)(cid:48),
63.0(cid:48)(cid:48)and 126(cid:48)(cid:48)). Point sources are contained in wavelet com-
ponents on smaller scales than the ﬁrst scale above, thus not
included. These image components were then co-added with
the residual image smoothed by the 840 kpc scale wavelet.
This procedure retains most of the statistically-signiﬁcant ex-
tended structures on various angular scales. The resulting im-
age is shown in Fig. 1b next to the original unsmoothed image;
we will use it as reference when discussing various features in
this cluster.

ample, to subtract the structures on large angular scales and
recover the temperature contrast of features on the interesting
small scales by reducing the projection effects. Of course,
such “deprojection” can only be qualitative, as we do not
know the gas distribution along the l.o.s. and have to assume
that structures on different scales are simply projected. Nev-
ertheless, for the interesting high-contrast features in A520,
this assumption should be close to reality.

This method has the greatest utility to recover the small-
scale, cool, bright structure at the “foot” and “leg” of A520
(Fig. 1). These high-gradient structures are mostly lost in the
adaptive Gaussian smoothing. By using the wavelet decom-
position instead of smoothing, the shape of these brightness
features are better preserved.

Based on this reference image, the narrow-band images and
their corresponding error images (with point sources excised)
were identically smoothed by a variable-width Gaussian. By
inspecting the error in the derived temperature map, we de-
termined that using the Gaussian smoothing radius ∝ ﬂux0.7,
and smoothing radius between 13 kpc and 200 kpc, achieved
a balance between revealing the temperature variations and
suppressing noise. The resulting temperature map is shown in
Fig. 2a.

To check the validity of values shown in the map, we ex-
tracted the proper spectra in a few hot spots > 10 keV (regions
T1-T4 in Fig. 2a) and ﬁtted their projected temperatures in
XSPEC. For T1, we obtain 12.1+3.4
−2.6 keV;
for T3, we could only obtain a lower bound of 11.9 keV. For
T4, the ﬁt is 12.2+2.5
−1.4 keV — all values
close to those in the smoothed map.

−1.9 keV, and for T5, 6.4+2.2

−2.4 keV; for T2, 11.3+4.1

We extracted wavelet components from the 0.8–4 keV im-
age binned to 1(cid:48)(cid:48) pixels, using 6.6, 13, 26, 53 and 105 kpc
scale wavelets, selecting the thresholds of statistical signif-
icance in order to achieve balance between retaining small-
scale details and minimizing noise and artifacts. The wavelet
decomposition coefﬁcients calculated for the 0.8–4 keV im-
age were used for all narrow-band images and their corre-
sponding error images (that is, the same smoothing was ap-
plied in all energy bands, as in §3.1). Point sources in the
6.6 kpc wavelet component were removed from those images
before coadding different scales. The resulting temperature
map is shown in Fig. 2b; it reveals the small-scale structure
much better than the one in panel a at the expense of being
only qualitative.

3.2. Wavelet-smoothed temperature map

The second method uses wavelet image decomposition
to identify structures at different angular scales, and leave
only the wavelet components on the scales of interest in the
narrow-band images used for temperature ﬁtting, instead of
simple Gaussian smoothing. This method allows us, for ex-

The bow shock to the SW of the cluster center, ﬁrst reported
in Markevitch et al. (2005), is readily apparent in the 0.8–
4 keV image (Fig. 1) and in the temperature map (Fig. 2).
The latter shows a region of about 5 keV in front of the shock
and 9–10 keV behind the shock. We extracted spectra from
4 sectors in 2 annular regions in front of the shock (S3-S10),

In the
pre-shock region, temperatures are ∼ 5 keV and are remark-
ably similar over this large area. Overall it appears that pre-
shock region is cool and undisturbed, with temperature falling
with radius slightly from T = 5.7±0.8 keV (S3-S6 combined,
r ∼ 650 kpc from the cluster center) to T = 4.5 ± 0.8 keV
(S7-S10 combined, r ∼ 900 kpc). Behind the shock, in re-
gions S0-S2, the temperatures span 8–14 keV. The values are
consistent with Markevitch et al. (2005) analysis of a shorter
dataset, who found T = 4.8+1.2
−0.8 keV in front of the shock and
T = 11.5+6.7
−3.1 keV behind (the latter value is deprojected, there-
fore not directly comparable to that here). In region S2, a cool
blob of gas appears to be projected onto the shock. This fea-
ture is coincident with a small but discernible brightness en-
hancement in the soft-band image. It could be a splash or a
broken off blob of the cool core inside the shocked gas. Re-
gardless of its origin, it may need to be masked in the analysis
of the shock, which will be the subject of a separate paper.

There is a kink in the shock surface (marked in Fig. 1), be-
hind which (downstream from the shock) is a region of en-
hanced X-ray brightness (“plume” in Fig. 1). The gas in the
plume (region S0) is as hot as the post-shock gas elsewhere,
though the temperature map (Fig. 2) suggests a mixture of
different temperatures there. It appears that a local gas inﬂow
from the south is crossing the shock at that location.

The apparent brightness edge northeast of the cluster center
(between splashes B and C in Fig. 1b) looks like a counterpart
(“reverse”) shock to the main shock front, but we do not de-
tect a signiﬁcant temperature difference between regions C3
and C4 ahead and behind that brightness feature. If there is a
shock surface here, it must have an unfavorable projection.

4.2. Break up of the cool core remnant

Behind the shock is a twisted structure resembling a leg (see
Fig. 1b and Fig. 3). There are dense clumps at the foot and
knee, and more along edge of the leg. The foot (zoomed onto
in inset of Fig. 4) is particularly striking. It consists of two
bright, very elongated (50× 10 kpc and 50× 20 kpc) clumps
separated by a gap with an X-ray brightness contrast of > 2.
Their projected temperatures are 1.5–2.5 keV (Fig. 4); the nar-
rower ﬁnger on the outside is the colder of the two. There is
no apparent galaxy coincident with the foot, but the ﬁngers are
displaced from the center of the BCG of one of the infalling
subclusters by only 16(cid:48)(cid:48) = 50 kpc.

The wavelet temperature map in Fig. 3 shows that cool
clumps trace the structure extending north from the foot to
the knee, which then turns east, continuing toward “splash A”
and “splash D” (Fig. 2; splashes will be discussed in § 4.3).
At the knee, a small X-ray brightness cavity does not show a
signiﬁcant deviation in projected temperature from the bright
blobs above it. Not all the surface brightness enhancements
correspond to cool spots (as one would expect if the struc-
ture were in pressure equilibrium), suggesting that projection
effects are signiﬁcant.

The overall picture strongly suggests that the “foot” and
the bent “leg” formed as a result of the disruption of a cool
core, once hosted by the subcluster centered on the BCG that
is now ahead of the foot (Fig. 1). The cool core have been
swept off its host by strong ram pressure of the merger, but
has not yet been completely mixed with the hot surrounding
gas. This is similar to the cool “bullet” in the Bullet cluster
displaced from the former subcluster host (Markevitch et al.
2002; Clowe et al. 2006), but, while the cool core in the Bullet

e

cluster remains a coherent shuttlecock structure, in A520 the
disruption has gone much further.

To see if this picture is consistent with the properties of the
cool clumps, we estimate the gas speciﬁc entropy and check
if it is similar to that in typical undisturbed cool cores. We
calculate the speciﬁc entropy using the following deﬁnition
(widely used in X-ray cluster work):
K = T n−2/3

(1)
where T is the gas temperature and ne is the electron num-
ber density. In all of our analysis, we assume ne = 1.17nH.
Since the regions in question are small and bright, they domi-
nate the emission along the l.o.s., so no deprojection is needed
for a qualitative estimate. For the outer, thinner ﬁnger (F1
in Fig. 4), assuming constant density within an elongated
cuboid, the derived density is nH = 2 × 10−2 cm−3, and T =
1.7 keV giving K = 20 keV cm2. Since the emission is actu-
ally conﬁned to a thinner region, if we assume instead a cylin-
drical geometry with diameter half the width of the extrac-
tion region, the density estimate increases by a factor 16/π
to 0.12 cm−3, which gives K = 7 keV cm2. For the inner, big-
ger ﬁnger (F2 in Fig. 4), an elliptical spectral extraction region
was used. It has T = 2.4 keV and density nH = 1.3×10−2 cm−3
assuming ellipsoidal geometry (long axis in the sky plane) and
constant density, which gives K = 40 keV cm2.

Since the speciﬁc entropy could only have increased in the
process of merger disruption (e.g., via mild shock heating),
such speciﬁc entropy values, along with the high gas densities,
put these gas clumps conﬁdently in the parameter space of the
central core regions of cool-core clusters (Cavagnolo et al.
2009). Thus, the cold gas “leg” indeed appears to be a trail of
pieces of a merger-disrupted cool core being swept by the gas
ﬂows. We will use this conclusion in § 5.4.

4.3. Splashes

The eastward extension of the leg curves to the SE after
about 300 kpc, and ends with a brightness edge (splash A
in Fig. 1b) not far beyond. Both the regular-smoothing and
wavelet temperature maps (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) show a cool spot
there. This is conﬁrmed by ﬁtting the spectra extracted in re-
gions G1-G4 along this extension, with the brightness edge
between G3 and G4 (Fig. 4). Region G3 on the denser side
of the edge is cooler than the rest of the regions, which them-
selves are consistent with the cluster average. The brightness
edge is most likely a “splash” of low-entropy gas — perhaps
one of the cool clumps remaining of the cool core and forming
the cool leg — that moved away from the gravitational poten-
tial well of the cluster, expanded and cooled adiabatically.

There is a subtle brightness island extending further SE
from splash A, marked splash D in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, whose
origin is unclear. Its projected temperature is not well con-
strained but does not rule out a cool structure.

North of the cluster center there is another possible splash
(splash B in Fig. 1b; also region T5 in Fig. 2). The sur-
face brightness structure is picked out by wavelet decompo-
sition, which can be seen in the original image to appear like
a pointed stream of gas. The temperature maps indicate that
this region is cool, and the soft brightness edge separates it
from the hot region to the east.

Another splash-like structure (splash C in Fig. 1b) is located
symmetrically opposite splash B about the merger axis and
coincides with one of the weak lensing mass clumps. How-
ever, the projected temperature here is in line with the cluster

5. DISCUSSION

5.1. Scene of a ‘train wreck’

The detail-rich Chandra X-ray image and gas temperature
maps of A520, especially the map in which we subtracted
the large-scale cluster emission using wavelet transformation,
tell a complex story about the events in this merging cluster.
From the X-ray and weak lensing data, we see a major merger
proceeding mostly along the NE-SW axis. The NE chain of
subclusters have apparently moved away from the collision
site, completely stripped of their gas and currently hosting
only low-level bumps of X-ray emission (we will discuss this
in detail in § 5.3). The SW subcluster is also moving away
from the cluster center, driving a prominent shock front. Ap-
parently, this subcluster had a cool core, which is now being
stripped by ram pressure, leaving a trail of cool clumps —
“foot”, “knee” and “leg”. The meandering shape of this trail,
its ending with splashes A and D, together with several other
signs of complex hydrodynamics such as the kink in the shock
surface, the “plume” next to it and “splash B” (Fig. 1), suggest
a secondary collision along the north-south direction. A cu-
rious X-ray “channel”, possibly resulting from this secondary
merger, will be discussed in § 5.2. The full history and details
of this “train wreck” of a cluster may be understood better
with a dedicated hydrodynamic simulation. However, already
our present broad-brush understanding of the A520 merger
lets us make three measurements that are interesting from the
cluster physics viewpoint.

5.2. X-ray channel

A close look at the X-ray image (in particular, Fig. 3a,
which show the image with different bin sizes, and Fig. 1d,
which shows an “unsharp-masked” image), reveals a subtle,
long X-ray brightness “channel”. It aligns with the direction
of the secondary merger that we mentioned above, running
from the “plume” in the south through the central region of
the cluster toward “splash B” in the north (Fig. 1). We se-
lected a sector in which this channel is most apparent and
which excludes any interfering features such as the leg, as
shown in Fig. 3a. An X-ray brightness proﬁle across the chan-
nel extracted in this sector is shown in Fig. 5. It conﬁrms a
highly signiﬁcant ∼ 10 − 12% drop in X-ray surface bright-
ness. The channel is about 30 kpc (9(cid:48)(cid:48)) wide and at least 200
kpc long, which is its length within our sector, though the
channel clearly extends beyond it and can be traced as an X-
ray dip in the leg and plume in the south, and similarly further
to the north.

The channel has to be a relatively thin sheet of lower-
density gas seen along the edge. If we assume a rough spher-
ical symmetry of the main cluster body, and assume that the
channel is completely devoid of gas in 3D, the sheet’s extent
along the l.o.s. would have to be ∼ 75 kpc to give the ob-
served projected X-ray brightness drop. Since it cannot be
completely empty, the extent should be signiﬁcantly greater.
It is interesting to speculate on the origin of the X-ray chan-
nel. First, we note that X-ray “cavities” ﬁlled with radio emis-
sion are routinely observed in cluster cool cores (e.g. McNa-
mara et al. 2000; Fabian et al. 2002, and later works); they are
created by outbursts of the central AGN, where the ejected
relativistic matter expands and pushes the thermal gas away.
However, the channel/ﬁlament in A520 is not in a cool core,
and its 500 − 700 kpc size is far greater than any of the cav-
ities seen in cluster cores. In principle, if in a certain region

the magnetic ﬁeld pressure reaches levels comparable to the
thermal pressure of the ICM, it may push the plasma away
from this region, in a manner similar to “plasma depletion
layers” observed near planets (e.g., Øieroset et al. 2004) and
features seen in the galaxy cluster context in MHD simula-
tions by ZuHone et al. (2011) (see their Fig. 23). Such a phe-
nomenon may have recently been observed by Werner et al.
(2016) in the core of the Virgo cluster (though they observed
X-ray enhancements rather than depletion regions).

In such a scenario, the sum of thermal and magnetic pres-
sure inside the channel would equal the thermal pressure out-
side (assuming the magnetic pressure outside to be negligible,
as expected for the bulk of the ICM). Neglecting projection ef-
fects — that is, assuming the channel to be a broad sheet span-
ning the whole cluster along the l.o.s. — the observed drop in
X-ray brightness would correspond to a drop in gas density by
5 − 6% and a drop in thermal pressure by 5 − 15% depending
on the temperature behavior. Such a drop of thermal pres-
sure would imply a plasma βp parameter (βp ≡ pthermal/pB)
reaching 10–20, compared to the usual βp ∼ few × 100. In
a high-B ﬁlament seen in simulations by ZuHone et al., both
density and temperature of the gas decline by similar factors,
so the temperature is likely to decline in this scenario.

Alternatively, the channel may be a purely hydrodynamic
feature — for example, a region of shock-heated gas currently
in thermal pressure equilibrium, which has been squeezed into
a sheet by gas ﬂows. In this case, the temperature in the chan-
nel should be higher by at least 5% than that on the outside.

To test these two possibilities, we extracted a projected tem-
perature proﬁle in the same sector across the channel (Fig. 5).
It does not show any signiﬁcant temperature changes from
the regions outside the channel, but a (cid:39) 10% deviation in ei-
ther direction cannot be excluded. Thus, both possibilities are
viable on the basis of the X-ray data. If the channel’s span
along the l.o.s. is less than assumed above, the 3D density and
temperature contrast may be higher (and the magnetic ﬁeld in
the ﬁrst scenario higher, too), but the projected surrounding
denser gas would still make it difﬁcult to detect any tempera-
ture difference.

Both of the above conﬁgurations may have emerged as a
result of a minor merger along the north-south direction. For
example, a small subcluster infalling from the south (to ex-
plain the kink in the shock surface) and crossing the main
cluster could have stretched the magnetic ﬁelds in its wake,
and/or generated a shock-heated region. Subsequently, this
region could have been squeezed into a sheet — for exam-
ple, by large-scale gas motions of the main NE-SW merger.
One can also think of a radio-ﬁlled X-ray cavity swept off one
of the merging cluster cores, stretched by a N-S merger and
compressed into a sheet. It is unclear where that subcluster is
now in the lensing mass map (it may be clump N in Okabe &
Umetsu 2008, which is not, however, a particularly signiﬁcant
feature in Clowe et al. 2012), or how a low-density, unstable
gas sheet could have survived as a coherent structure in the
middle of an ongoing merger. Such details might be clariﬁed
by a dedicated hydrodynamic simulation. In all of the above
scenarios, we expect the magnetic ﬁeld in the channel to be
enhanced and oriented preferentially along the channel (be-
cause of stretching and compression). This may produce a
bright ﬁlament in the cluster’s giant radio halo (Govoni et al.
2001; Vacca et al. 2014), because the synchrotron radio emis-
sivity is proportional to B2, and that ﬁlament would be polar-
ized. Giant radio halos are unpolarized (Feretti et al. 2012),

mass of the tail clumps suggested by lensing, not much gas
can be seen in the Chandra image, and not much galaxy light
is seen in the Subaru i(cid:48)-band image either — in particular in
the outer tail clump (Fig. 11c in Okabe & Umetsu). This is
very interesting in view of the debated “dark core” in the cen-
ter of A520; these clumps may be even “darker” and we will
try to quantify this below.

We will now concentrate on the outer tail clump, because
it is least affected by X-ray projection. (The inner tail clump
is more signiﬁcant in the lensing map, but it is hopeless to
deproject it in X-rays.) We will compare the speciﬁc entropy
of the gas in the clump with that for the main cluster gas at
the same distance from the cluster center, estimate the clump
total mass under the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, and
derive a gas-to-mass ratio for the clump.

so this would be a notable feature. The currently available ra-
dio data lack angular resolution to test this prediction (Wang,
Giacintucci, & Markevitch 2016, in prep.).

5.3. Dark subclusters in the northeast

A520 exhibits a low X-ray brightness, relatively narrow
tail, a subtle feature but clearly visible out to about 1.3 Mpc
northeast from the cluster center (Fig. 1; seen more clearly
in a heavily-binned image in Fig. 6). It has two broad X-ray
peaks, each of which coincides with a mass clump seen in
the weak lensing map (Fig. 6). The tail and the clumps are
aligned in the NE-SW direction of the main merger. The out-
ermost clump, centered 1.2 Mpc from the cluster center and
approximately 0.5 Mpc in diameter, is particularly interest-
ing, because it is relatively free of projection of the rest of the
messy cluster, which lets us make several quantitative mea-
surements.

Only two Chandra pointings (ObsIDs 9425, 9526) captured
the tail, for an effective exposure of about 200 ks. Spectra ex-
tracted from regions C1 and C2, which approximately include
the outer and inner of the two tail clumps, respectively, show
that they are both hot, with the outer tail clump (C1) being
slightly hotter than the inner (Fig. 4).

The tail mass peaks are visible in two independent datasets,
Subaru (see Fig. 11 in Okabe & Umetsu 2008) and Magellan
(Clowe et al. 2012). In the latter paper, only the inner tail peak
is shown (peak 1 in their Fig. 2); the outer, less signiﬁcant
peak is not shown because it was outside the HST FOV, but
it is seen in the uncropped version of the map provided by D.
Clowe, which we show in Fig. 1 and Fig. 6. The Subaru map
covers a bigger ﬁeld than Magellan or Chandra and reveals
another clump (their clump NE1) still further to the northeast,
but the Subaru map does not resolve these two Magellan tail
clumps, showing them as one (NE2). For the quite substantial

To derive the gas density, we ﬁt the heavily-binned X-
ray image (Fig. 6) with a simple model consisting of two
spherically-symmetric 3D β-model density proﬁles — one for
the clump and another for the main cluster outskirt near the
radius of the clump. The β-model proﬁle is given by

gas temperatures and the Chandra energy band) in the form

For the cluster outskirt, we extracted a 0.8–4 keV radial
surface brightness proﬁle in an annulus around the same dis-
tance from the cluster center as the clump, with prominent
asymmetric features (tail including the clump, foot, shock,
splashes) masked out as shown in Fig. 6. It is not obvious
where the “center” of a messy merger is; for this exercise,
the center is selected as a centroid of the X-ray emission at
the relevant radii in the outskirts. We ﬁt the proﬁle in this
annulus using a model given by Eq. 3, ﬁxing the core radius
rc at a typical value of 180 kpc (since we ﬁt very far from
the core). To determine the normalization n0, we extracted
a spectrum in the same region, ﬁt it in XSPEC using APEC
model, and compared the model emission measure integrated

cluster outskirt model are β = 0.62 and nH,0 = 4.4×10−3 cm−3
and T = 4.1+1.4
The clump density model was then ﬁtted in 2D (that is,
pixel-by-pixel, as opposed to extracting a radial proﬁle),
because the cluster outskirt contribution makes the surface
brightness distribution non-radial. We added a β-model den-
sity component for the clump to the density model for the
outskirt, ﬁxing the latter at its best ﬁt derived above (which
masked out the clump region with a good margin). We chose
to add the clump density component, rather than replacing
one with the other in the 3D region of the clump, to avoid

certainties due to the unknown geometry.

Using the deprojected temperature and density for the
clump, we can estimate the speciﬁc entropy of the gas at its
center (deﬁned as in Eq. 1) is 930+510
−320 keV cm2, with the error
accounting only for the uncertainty in temperature. For com-
parison, the gas in the outskirts has K = 1540+530
−340 keV cm2 at
this radius. The two values are consistent, and both are con-
sistent with the entropy range (1− 2)× 103 keV cm2 observed
at r ∼ 1 − 1.3 Mpc for a large sample of clusters (Cavagnolo
et al. 2009). The temperature and density of the gas in the
clump are consistent with adiabatic compression of the 4 keV
gas from the outskirts perturbed by the gravitational attraction
of the clump. In contrast, for cool cores, Cavagnolo et al. ob-
serve K < 50 keV cm2, far below the observed value for the
clump, so this gas cannot be a remnant of a former cool core
(like the “foot”, § 4.2). We will speculate on the sequence of
events that could have created this clump after estimating its
mass below.

any smoothness issues for the hydrostatic mass estimates; this
choice does not matter as long as the model ﬁts the X-ray im-
age well. The sum of the two density components was calcu-
lated in 3D and a projected emission measure was calculated
for each pixel of the X-ray image in a masked near-circular
region of r = 250 kpc (Fig. 6). The best-ﬁt shape parameters
for the clump are β = 0.80 and rc = 203 kpc, and the model
ﬁts the image very well (χ2 = 135/199 = 0.68).

To derive the absolute gas density in the clump, we need
the gas temperature. If we assume the clump to be isother-
mal with the outskirt, its density normalization can be derived
directly from the X-ray surface brightness and the outskirt
model derived above. This gives the clump model normaliza-
tion of nH,0c = 8.4× 10−4 cm−3. Adding to it 1.4× 10−4 cm−3
from the outskirt at the radius of the clump gives nH = 1.0×
10−3 cm−3 total at the center of the clump. The clump is a
rather signiﬁcant gas overdensity — 7 times the density of the
main cluster at this radius.

However, the clump has a higher projected temperature than
the outskirt, T = 8.1+3.6
−1.9 keV (for region C1 in Fig. 4, which
covers the clump), and its 3D temperature should be higher
still. Therefore, we also consider the case in which an isother-
mal, but hotter, clump is embedded in the outskirt. We make
a simple assumption that all gas within a r = 250 kpc sphere
of the clump is at a higher temperature. We generate a model
image with a cutout for this sphere and calculate the projected
contribution of the 4 keV outskirts to the clump spectrum (it
is about 9% in projected emission measure at the center of the
clump). Adding this as a “background” model for the spec-
trum of the clump, we obtain a “deprojected” clump temper-
ature T = 9.7+5.5
−3.3 keV, which is slightly higher but consistent
with the projected temperature (as expected, given the rela-
tively high brightness contrast) and the density at the center
of the clump increased by 10% to nH = 1.1× 10−3 cm−3 com-
pared to the isothermal assumption — a negligible change for
our qualitative estimates, and considering the systematic un-

estimate its total mass, assuming that its hot gas is close to hy-
drostatic equilibrium with the clump’s gravitational potential.
The equilibrium should be achieved on a timescale of sound
crossing the size of the subcluster. Considering that the sub-
cluster is unlikely to move supersonically at such a distance
from the core (we also do not see any shocks around it), this
assumption should be adequate for a qualitative estimate.

The total enclosed mass within the radius r for a spherical

mass clump is given by (e.g., Sarazin 1988)

where µ is the mean atomic mass per gas particle (µ = 0.6
for ICM), T (r) is the local gas temperature at the radius r and
nH is the gas density, which is the sum of the clump and out-
skirt density models in our case. For an accurate estimate, a
temperature proﬁle is required, for which our data are not ad-
equate — all we know is that the temperature near the clump
center is around 10 keV and it goes down to 4 keV in the
main cluster’s outskirts. Therefore, we will make two isother-
mal estimates for these two temperature values to get a rough
range of masses. (The higher-temperature estimate would ne-
glect the (d lnT /d lnr) contribution, which should be nonzero
in this case, partially canceling out the effect of the expected
lower local T at the radius of the estimate.) For the gas den-
sity gradient, we will use the best-ﬁt model (sum of offset
3D beta-models) obtained above, calculating the gradient in
the direction tangential to the main cluster in order to iso-
late the effect of the clump. We will calculate the mass for a
radius well within our model ﬁt above. Within a r = 200 kpc
sphere, we obtain the total mass of 2.5×1013 M(cid:12) and 6×1013
M(cid:12) for the lower and higher temperature values, respectively
(of course, statistical errors do not matter with such a mod-
eling uncertainty). This is consistent with masses within the
same radius derived for real mid-temperature clusters (e.g.,
Vikhlinin et al. 2006).

To assess the sensitivity of the clump hydrostatic mass es-
timate to our assumption of spherical symmetry for the main
cluster’s outskirt, we varied the surface brightness of the out-
skirt by factor ±2 in the region of the clump and reﬁtted the
density model for the clump. The resulting variations in the
quantity d lognH/d logr (where nH is the sum of the clump

and outskirt components, and r is the distance from the cen-
ter of the clump), which determines the clump mass estimate,
varies by at most 40% in the radial range of interest. Thus, our
estimate should be relatively robust to geometric assumptions.
It is interesting to compare our mass estimate with a weak
lensing mass for this clump. D. Clowe (private communica-
tion) provided us with an estimate of a projected mass within
a cylinder of r = 150 kpc. Depending on whether the HST
data (partially covering the clump) are included in the recon-
struction along with the Magellan data, the projected mass is
(1.7−2.3)×1013 M(cid:12); the statistical signiﬁcance of this clump
detection is only 2–3σ. To convert our 3D measurement into a
projected mass, we assume that the clump’s total mass proﬁle
is truncated at r = 300 kpc. For the low and high temperatures,
we obtain the projected masses within the r = 150 kpc aper-
ture of 2.4× 1013 M(cid:12)and 5.6× 1013 M(cid:12), respectively. The
lower range of our X-ray estimates is in agreement with the
lensing value.

With this qualitative validation for our mass estimate, we
now estimate the gas mass fraction fgas for the clump. Within
the r = 200 kpc sphere, we get fgas = 0.03 and 0.014 for the
cool and hot clump assumptions, respectively. This is low —
even the former, conservatively high value is at least a fac-
tor 2 below the fgas values observed within the same radius
in relaxed clusters (e.g., Vikhlinin et al. 2006). So the tail
clump appears to be “dark” in terms of the apparent deﬁcit of
both the galaxy light and the ICM density. The caveat here
is the uncertainty in the total mass is quite high, and one can-
not be entirely conﬁdent in the X-ray hydrostatic equilibrium
assumption here; a more sensitive weak lensing observation
may reduce the total mass and fgas uncertainty.

Based on the high speciﬁc entropy that we derived in § 5.3.1
(consistent with that in the A520 outskirts), a cluster-like to-
tal mass and an anomalously low gas fraction, we speculate
that this clump entered the collision site from the SW as a
fairly massive subcluster. It then lost all of its gas to ram pres-
sure stripping (and probably all matter in its outskirts to tidal
stripping) during the passage through the main cluster, but re-
accreted some high-entropy gas from the A520 outskirt once
it emerged on the other side. The gas compressed adiabati-
cally into its potential well once the subcluster slowed down
sufﬁciently. Of course, the resulting fgas need not be any-
where near the universal value. On subsequent infall, such a
subcluster would be the analog of the dark-matter dominated
“gasless” subclusters used in idealized hydrodynamic simu-
lations (e.g., Ascasibar & Markevitch 2006; ZuHone et al.
2010), which disturb the gravitational potential but produce
few hydrodynamic effects.

Judging from the X-ray/lensing overlay, the more promi-
nent inner-tail lensing mass peak (clump 1 in Clowe et al.
2012) appears to have a similar or even lower gas-to-mass ra-
tio (the peak X-ray brightness is similar and the lensing mass
is higher). We did not attempt any quantitative X-ray esti-
mates for this clump because the 3D geometry is very uncer-
tain.

5.4. Constraints on thermal conduction

Thermal conductivity is one of the important but poorly
known properties of the ICM. It is determined by the topol-
ogy of the tangled magnetic ﬁeld frozen into the ICM and
by plasma microphysics. The heat transport should be com-
pletely suppressed across the ﬁeld lines (because the electron
gyroradii are many orders of magnitude smaller than other rel-

evant linear scales in the ICM, Sarazin 1988), while heat may
ﬂow along the lines between those regions of the ICM for
which such a path along the lines exists. However, even along
the ﬁled lines, the heat transport may be strongly suppressed
in a high-βP plasma (such as the ICM) because of micro-scale
plasma instabilities (e.g., Schekochihin et al. 2008).

Observationally, few deﬁnitive measurements have been
done. Across cold fronts, where the temperature jumps
abruptly, thermal conductivity has been shown to be sup-
pressed by at least a couple of orders of magnitude compared
to the Spitzer value (Ettori & Fabian 2000, and later works).
The likely explanation is the magnetic ﬁeld “draping” along
the cold front surface as a result of the gas ﬂowing around it,
which effectively isolates the two sides of the front from each
other (Vikhlinin et al. 2001; Markevitch & Vikhlinin 2007;
ZuHone et al. 2011). Some constraints outside the special
regions of cold fronts have been reported, based on the ex-
istence of spatial temperature variations in the ICM. For ex-
ample, Markevitch et al. (2003b) derived an order of magni-
tude suppression of conductivity between regions of different
temperature in the body of a hot merging cluster A754, and
Eckert et al. (2012) derived a large suppression factor based
on the survival of a tail of cool gas stripped from a group
infalling into the hot cluster A2142. In both cases, the physi-
cal signiﬁcance of the constraints is ambiguous because the
topology of the magnetic ﬁelds is unclear — for example,
it is possible (and in the case of the infalling group, likely)
that the observed regions of the different temperature come
from separate subclusters whose magnetic ﬁeld structures re-
mained topologically disconnected even after the merger, so
there are simply no pathways for heat exchange (as suggested
in Markevitch et al. 2003b). Indirect upper limits on the effec-
tive isotropic conduction based on the analysis of ICM density
ﬂuctuations have also been derived (e.g., Gaspari & Churazov
2013).

The cool clumps in the “leg” of A520 come from the same
cool core (§ 4.2), so their magnetic ﬁeld structure should be
(a) interconnected and (b) stretched along the trail by the same
gas motions that separated the cool core pieces. This offers
a unique opportunity to constrain the conductivity along the
ﬁeld lines. We know the Mach number of the shock front and
the velocity of the post-shock ﬂow (Markevitch et al. 2005),
which lets us estimate how long ago they were stripped based
on their distance along the trail. We can then determine if the
conductivity between them should be suppressed by compar-
ing the Spitzer conduction timescale with their age,

κ/κS = (tage/tcond)−1.

(5)

In our simple picture, the “foot” is the last piece of the for-
mer cool core that is still gravitationally bound to the sub-
cluster that drives the shock (or, at least, it has been bound
until recently). The post-shock gas ﬂow peels away pieces
of the cool core, carrying them off at the downstream veloc-
ity of 1000 km s−1 (Markevitch et al. 2005). Guided by the
temperature map (Fig. 3b), we picked two pairs of circular
regions in near contact (in projection) that have large and sig-
niﬁcant temperature differences. The blobs are assumed to
attain their present temperature and spatial separation upon
stripping from the core, and then to move with the ﬂow to-
gether; the distance of the pair from the “foot” along the “leg”
gives the age of the pair.

We estimated the thermal conduction timescale as in, e.g.,

The regions we selected are far from saturation. The density
in Eq. 6 is taken to be the average density in the corresponding
stretch of the leg, nH = 0.01 cm−3. This is uncertain to a factor
2, based on density estimates for each region using two differ-
ent geometric assumptions — all emission originating from a
sphere in projection (leading to higher densities and therefore
longer tcond), or from cylinder along the l.o.s. that is 400 kpc
long (the opposite effect). Therefore our values of κS/κ also
has a factor of 2 uncertainty arising from this.
We also consider how the uncertainty in lT affect our re-
sults. Since tcond ∼ l2
T , it is important to estimate the gra-
dient correctly. For one set of estimates, we use the pro-
jected temperatures in the regions of interest, measured using
XSPEC. However, projection is likely to wash out the tem-
perature gradient, resulting in longer lT . While our wavelet
temperature map (§ 3.2) is qualitative, it removes most of the
projection effects and leaves only the relevant linear scales.
Fig. 3b shows a temperature map created with only the small-
est wavelet components that correspond to the angular scale
of the structures in the leg. Using the temperature values from
this map, the values of T /∆T are up to 2 times smaller. We
note that since we calculate the gradients using projected dis-
tances between the regions, this is a lower limit for lT . On the
other hand, the leg may be bent along the l.o.s., so our ages
for the region pairs may be underestimated. And of course,
the absence of a temperature gradient does not always result
from thermal conduction, so we can only place a lower limit
for an order-of-magnitude estimate of a suppression factor.

The results are shown in Table 1. For regions 1 and 2 (see
Fig. 3b), we cannot say whether the conduction is suppressed
— the suppression factor is consistent with 1 for both the
projected or deprojected temperatures. For regions 3 and 4,
κS/κ ∼ 3.3 − 11, so there seems to be some suppression.
We did not use splash A at the end of the cool trail for this
estimate, even though there appears to be a signiﬁcant temper-
ature gradient there. The splash should have been cooling via
adiabatic expansion as it formed, so its age is very uncertain.
The above attempted constraints for the suppression along

the ﬁeld lines can be contrasted with thermal conductivity
across the edge of the cool trail of gas.
In our scheme for
A520, the cool trail should be isolated from the surrounding
gas by a magnetic ﬁeld stretched along its boundary (a likely
analog of the infalling group in Eckert et al. 2012). For ex-
ample, consider the feature marked ‘edge’ in Fig. 3b. Along
this trail of cool gas, the temperature gradient is small. How-
ever, in the perpendicular direction, the gas temperature jumps
from about 4.5 keV in the leg to 12 keV for the post-shock gas
on a scale smaller than 10 kpc. The trail is 120 kpc long, im-
plying an age of 1.2× 108 yr from the cool core at the down-
stream velocity. The density inside the trail is estimated from
the emission measure in the same region (assuming cylindri-
cal shape) to be 6×10−3 cm−3. For these values, λe = 3.5 kpc,
so this is still in the unsaturated conduction regime. We ﬁnd
tcond = 7× 105 yr, implying (κ/κS)−1 (cid:38) 170. We are probably
overestimating both lT and ne, so this is a conservative esti-
mate of the suppression factor. Thus, this trail could not have
formed in the presence of any signiﬁcant thermal conduction
across the edge.

6. SUMMARY

The deep Chandra exposure of Abell 520 revealed rich
structure in this cluster train wreck, including a prominent
bow shock. Some of these structures provide interesting con-
straints on cluster physics. We derived detailed gas tem-
perature maps using two methods, one that utilizes variable-
width smoothing and evaluates the projected temperature, and
another that uses wavelet decomposition to “deproject” the
large-scale structure in a qualitative way and enhance the con-
trast of the interesting small-scale structure.

On small scales, A520 exhibits an apparent disrupted cool
core at a unique evolutionary stage — the gas of the core is
swept away from the central galaxy of its former host subclus-
ter by ram pressure of the gas ﬂow downstream of the shock
front, completely displacing the gas peak from the galaxy (by
50–70 kpc). The disrupted core is not mixed with the hot gas
but still forms a physically connected trail of dense clumps
(a cool “leg”).
Its twisted structure apparently reﬂects the
chaotic gas velocities in this region. The core remnant in
A520 is at a later stage of disruption compared to the bullet
in the Bullet cluster, where it is still seen as a regular shuttle-
cock structure. The speciﬁc entropy of the gas in the clumps
is much lower than elsewhere in the cluster and is typical of
other cool cores.

In the above scenario, the magnetic ﬁeld within the leg
should be stretched along the leg and still connect the clumps
(since they come from the same core), while insulating the leg
from the surrounding hot gas. We use the observed tempera-
ture variations between the cool leg and the surrounding gas,
and within the leg, to constrain thermal conductivity across
the ﬁeld lines (a factor > 100 suppression from the Spitzer
value) and, for the ﬁrst time, suggest that the conductivity
along the lines may also be suppressed by a factor of at least
several. This is, of course, dependent on our assumption about
the magnetic ﬁeld structure.

About 1.3 Mpc northeast of the cluster center, the X-ray im-
age reveals a subtle tail of low X-ray brightness. Two clumps
in the tail coincide with mass peaks seen in the weak lens-
ing mass map. For one of the clumps that is least affected
by projection, we derived a speciﬁc entropy of the X-ray gas,
which turns out to be similar to the high value for the cluster
gas at that radius, while the gas density in the clump is sev-
eral times higher. Thus, the X-ray enhancement at that clump

12

appears to be due to adiabatic compression of the surround-
ing gas. The second clump looks similar, though quantitative
estimates are difﬁcult because of projection. It appears that
these clumps have passed through the cluster merger site and
lost all of their gas (or, alternatively, arrived to the cluster al-
ready gasless) and then re-accreted the surrounding outskirt
gas as soon as they slowed down sufﬁciently. An X-ray hy-
drostatic estimate the total mass of the clump is consistent
with the lensing mass. The ratio of the X-ray measured gas
mass to total mass is 1.5–3%, much lower than the typical
average cluster value, making these clumps truly “dark sub-
clusters”. Of course, considering our scenario for their origin
with stripping and re-accretion, it would have to be a coinci-
dence if the resulting gas fraction ended up the same as the
universal cluster value.

Finally, we found a curious long (> 200 kpc), narrow (30
kpc or 9(cid:48)(cid:48)) X-ray “channel”, going across the bright cluster re-
gion along the direction of an apparent secondary merger. The
projected X-ray brightness in the channel is 10–12% lower
than in the adjacent regions. The channel has to be a sheet
spanning at least 75 kpc along the l.o.s. It is possible that this
is a “plasma depletion layer” with the magnetic ﬁeld stretched
and enhanced by the merger; the plasma β parameter should
reach 10–20 in the sheet. In this scenario, we predict that the
channel will be seen as a bright ﬁlament in the radio image of
sufﬁcient angular resolution, and the ﬁlament will be polar-
ized.

The prominent bow shock in this cluster will be studied
in our subsequent work (Wang, Giacintucci, & Markevitch
2016, in prep.).
