Abstract. We present the results of a search for elastic scattering from galactic dark matter
in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in the 4 − 30 GeV/c2 mass
range. We make use of a 582 kg-day ﬁducial exposure from an array of 800 g Germanium
bolometers equipped with a set of interleaved electrodes with full surface coverage. We
searched speciﬁcally for ∼ 2.5 − 20 keV nuclear recoils inside the detector ﬁducial volume.
As an illustration the number of observed events in the search for 5 (resp. 20) GeV/c2
WIMPs are 9 (resp. 4), compared to an expected background of 6.1 (resp. 1.4). A 90% CL
limit of 4.3 × 10−40 cm2 (resp. 9.4 × 10−44 cm2) is set on the spin-independent WIMP-
nucleon scattering cross-section for 5 (resp. 20) GeV/c2 WIMPs. This result represents a
41-fold improvement with respect to the previous EDELWEISS-II low-mass WIMP search for
7 GeV/c2 WIMPs. The derived constraint is in tension with hints of WIMP signals from some
recent experiments, thus conﬁrming results obtained with diﬀerent detection techniques.

A vast array of observations from galactic to the largest observable scales in the Universe is
currently best interpreted within the ΛCDM framework [1], which assumes the existence of
non-baryonic dark matter as one of its foundations [2]. Since the dark matter properties are
very poorly constrained as of now, many models have been proposed to describe its nature.
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) constitute a generic candidate with a mass
in the GeV to TeV range. WIMPs from our galactic halo can scatter oﬀ atomic nuclei and
generate detectable keV-scale nuclear recoils [3].

In this article, we will focus on the direct detection of WIMPs with mass MX ranging
from 4 to 30 GeV/c2. Thermal relics in this mass range are somewhat disfavored both
from constraints set by Fermi-LAT searches for annihilation signals in dwarf galaxies [4], and
from the impact that WIMP annihilation would leave on the cosmic microwave background
anisotropies [5]. However, many scenarios have been proposed where the evolutions of the
”dark” and ”visible” sectors in the early Universe are such that the relic dark matter number
density is naturally close to the baryon density [6–8]. The current measurements of the
corresponding mass densities, Ωc and Ωb, then imply that MX ∼ 5 GeV/c2, which we will
use as a benchmark WIMP mass for this search.

In addition, several dark matter search experiments [9–12] using diﬀerent target nuclei
and experimental approaches found hints of WIMP dark matter whose mass could be in
the 6 to 50 GeV/c2 range, and WIMP-nucleon elastic cross-section in the 10−40 − 10−42 cm2
range. The consistency between these hints was debated [13, 14]. More importantly they are
already severely constrained by other experimental searches [15, 16]. The aim of this article
is also to provide an independent check of these former results.

To search for low-energy WIMP-induced nuclear recoils, detectors with both low detec-
tion threshold and a very low background are needed. The EDELWEISS experiment operates
high-purity Germanium crystals in a cryogenic low-background environment, inside the Lab-
oratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM). For each detector, the combined measurement of heat
and ionisation signals enables the discrimination of a potential WIMP-induced signal against
several radioactive backgrounds. The latest generation of EDELWEISS detectors, equipped
with a set of Fully InterDigitized electrodes (FID detectors [17]), provides the possibility to

– 1 –

select interactions taking place inside a large ﬁducial fraction of each detector. During the
third stage of the EDELWEISS experiment, a ten-month-long run in low-background condi-
tions was carried out with an array of twenty-four ∼ 800-g FID detectors. We exploit here the
data from eight of those detectors to search for low-mass WIMPs. In the following sections,
we will ﬁrst present in some details the detector performances and backgrounds of relevance
for this search. We will then describe the WIMP search itself, which makes use of a Boosted
Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm dedicated to background rejection. Finally, the lack of a
signiﬁcant excess of WIMP-like events over the predicted backgrounds is exploited to derive
a set of limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross-sections. This result extends the sensitivity of the
previous low-mass WIMP search carried out with EDELWEISS-II detectors [18], thanks to
a higher exposure, lower thresholds and better background rejection.

2 Detector performances and backgrounds

2.1 Overview of the experimental setup

The detectors used in this search consist of 820 to 890 g cylindric HPGe monocrystals with an
appropriate surface treatment [19]. Fig. 1 illustrates the operation principle of these detectors.
Interleaved ring electrodes were evaporated over both their planar and side surfaces. Under
nominal operation, these electrodes are polarised alternatively at +4 and −1.5 V on the
top side, and opposite-sign voltages on the bottom. All electrodes at a given voltage are
wired together, so that there are four charge readout channels per detector. The electric ﬁeld
generated by this voltage setting inside the crystal is such that charges created far enough
from its surface generate a time-integrated signal only on the so-called ﬁducial electrodes
polarized at ±4 V. This deﬁnes the so-called ﬁducial volume, whose mass is on average
625 g. Charges created close to the surface will generate signals both on the ﬁducial and
the veto electrodes (polarized at ∓1.5 V). For each detector, two neutron transmutation
doped (NTD) thermistors are glued on the top and bottom surfaces. When operated at low
temperature, they provide a measurement of the total energy deposited in the detector after
thermalisation, in an identical way as for EDELWEISS-I [20] and EDELWEISS-II [21].

These detectors diﬀer from the ID bolometers used in the previous phase of the exper-
iment [21, 22] by their large mass, and for being fully covered with interleaved electrodes,
hence the name ”FID”. However, their working principle is similar. For each recorded in-
teraction, the measurement of charge topology enables the rejection of surface interactions
such as those generated by 210Pb subsequent decays at the detector surface and immedi-
ate surroundings. The corresponding rejection factor for 800-g FID detectors is better than
4 × 10−5 (90% CL) above 15 keV recoil energies, as derived from the exposure of two detec-
tors to 210Pb sources [23]. After ﬁducial selection, the combined heat and ﬁducial ionisation
measurements provide a way to distinguish electron recoils (ER) and nuclear recoils (NR),
since they have diﬀerent ionisation yields. In [17], it was shown using 133Ba sources that the
fraction of electron recoils present in the 90% CL NR region is less than 6 × 10−6 (90% CL).
No sign of a degradation of this rejection performance as a function of energy is observed,
except for the case when the signal amplitudes are similar to their baseline ﬂuctuations.

The data used in this search was taken in the EDELWEISS cryostat at LSM during
a ten-month-long run between July 2014 and April 2015, where the cryostat was kept at a
stabilized 18 mK temperature during all the data-taking periods. The experimental setup is
presented in detail in [24, 25]. The WIMP target is an array of twenty-four FID detectors
in a compact geometry of six four-unit towers, supported by a high-purity copper structure.

Figure 1. Cross-sectional view of an 800-g FID detector. The ﬁducial and veto electrodes are
represented with their corresponding wirings. Electric ﬁeld lines are shown inside the detector, as
derived from a numerical calculation. The associated ﬁducial volume is represented in green, while
charge depositions taking place inside the red regions are tagged by signals on a veto electrode.

Each detector is mounted inside a high-purity copper casing, and is held inside this casing
with small teﬂon holders. The cryostat is a reverse-geometry dilution fridge, inside a set of
radiopure copper thermal screens at 1 K, 4.2 K, 40 K and 100 K.

Gamma radiation is attenuated by an 18 cm thick layer of modern lead lined with a 2 cm
inner layer of Roman lead, together with a 14 cm Roman lead plate cooled at 1 K to shield
the detectors from the cold electronics. The resulting background measured in the ﬁducial
volume of the detectors in the 20 − 200 keV range is 70 counts per kg-day [26]. Polyethylene
shields consist of an outer 50 cm layer, an additional 5 cm layer and a 10 cm plate screening
the detectors from the cold electronics. They were designed to reduce the single neutron
scatter rate in the detectors to 3× 10−4 events per kg-day [24]. The entire outer polyethylene
shield is covered by plastic scintillators (98% geometrical eﬃciency for throughgoing muons),
read out in coincidence with the bolometers to reject muon-induced events [27].

The cold and warm electronics are described in [25, 28, 29]. The main diﬀerence with
respect to the electronics chain used previously by EDELWEISS (eg. [21]) concerns the
ionisation channels. The ﬁrst stage of ampliﬁcation consists of a ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor follower
with no bias and feedback resistors to avoid their thermal noises. Based on the ADC output
readout sampled at 100 kHz, the gate voltage is periodically adjusted through a capacitance

– 3 –

by a FPGA-based software controlling a DAQ. As a consequence, the response of the system
to a charge deposit is a step function. The integration time for the charge signal is then
only limited by pile-up. With the adopted integration time of 1 sec, we obtained baseline
resolutions a factor two better on average than those achieved in [21]. The heat signals are
described and modelled in [30]: their rise time of the order of 5 ms is followed by three decays
of ∼ 10, 100 and 1000 ms.

2.2 Event recording and selection

For nuclear recoils, the observed signal-to-noise ratio is better for the heat signal amplitude
than for the ionisation one. The decision to store data to disk is therefore triggered by com-
paring the amplitude of the ﬁltered heat channels to a reference online threshold. The ﬁlter
consists of a Finite-Impulse-Response Butterworth high-pass ﬁlter followed by a convolution
with a predeﬁned pulse template. The stored data consist of the raw traces of all channels of
the corresponding detector and its neighbors. In WIMP search runs, the online threshold is
automatically adjusted by an algorithm designed to lower the threshold as much as possible
without exceeding a trigger rate of 50 mHz, i.e. ten times the rate of physical pulses.

From both the heat baseline resolution measurement at a given time σ(t) and the value
of instantaneous trigger level Ethr(t), we model the trigger eﬃciency as a function of heat
energy E with the function:

1 + Erf

The agreement between this model and measurements using coincidences either in WIMP
search runs or with neutron calibration data is good, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

The reconstruction of each event is done simultaneously from the diﬀerent channels that
are recorded. The signal amplitudes and their timing are adjusted using template shapes.
The amplitudes are adjusted under the constraint of the simultaneity of all pulses in the
event, at the time given by the most signiﬁcant one in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. The
heat amplitudes are ﬁt in the frequency domain, using the noise power spectrum extracted
from the data between triggers and updated at an hourly basis. For the ionisation channels,
to avoid windowing biases due to the pulses extending far outside the recorded samples, ﬁts
are performed in the time domain, after applying a numerical ﬁlter. Cross-talk corrections
and energy calibrations are carried out for each detector using events recorded in the presence
of two 133Ba gamma sources which were regularly used during the run. All the energies are
calibrated in terms of ﬁducial electron recoils (keVee,ﬁd). The non-linearities of the ionisation
response are negligible below a few hundreds of keV. On the other hand, a correction is
applied to the heat energy scale down to low energy to take into account the measured
non-linearities.

For a given detector, the heat signals of both NTDs are combined into one using weights
that optimize the resolution. The ﬁducial ionisation signal is deﬁned as the average of the
signals on the two electrodes biased at ±4 V [31, 32], while the total ionisation is deﬁned as
the average of all four electrode signals.

Appart from a few detectors with speciﬁc issues such as a nonfunctional channel, the
main diﬀerence between detectors in terms of performance is related to variations in their
heat noise, which drives their online threshold. In order to optimize the sensitivity to WIMP
masses in the 4 to 30 GeV/c2 range, we decided to use eight detectors with the best online
threshold distributions. For each detector, we selected time periods when the online threshold

is less than 1.5 keVee,ﬁd. In addition, we rejected the small fraction of time when the combined
heat baseline FWHM was larger than 1 keVee,ﬁd, the ﬁducial ionisation FWHM was larger
than 0.7 keVee,ﬁd, or one of the veto electrode FWHM was larger than 1.5 keVee,ﬁd. This
results in a total of 927 live detector-days for WIMP searches, including the eﬀects of various
DAQ-related deadtimes. The ﬁducial fraction was measured for each detector using the
triplet of cosmic activation lines associated to 65Zn, 68Ga and 68Ge, at 9.0, 9.7 and 10.4 keV,
in the same way as in [21]: the electron recoils associated to those lines are distributed
homogeneously inside the detector volume. The total intensity of these lines was measured
using both heat and ionisation signals. The line intensity inside the ﬁducial volume is then
estimated after applying a cut of < 2.58 σ of the baseline on the signals from veto electrodes.
The ﬁducial fraction is the ratio of the ﬁducial over total line intensities. In the energy range
of interest, its variation with energy is a small eﬀect, taken into account later in the analysis.
The resulting exposure inside the ﬁducial volume is 582 kg-days. Table 1 summarizes the
most relevant performances of individual detectors.

In order to select only well-reconstructed pulses and reject pile-ups, we applied cuts on
the χ2 resulting from individual trace adjustments. The eﬃciency of these cuts is measured
using the 9.0 − 10.4 keV triplet. The average eﬃciency loss is 9%, mostly driven by the heat
channels. To reject interactions taking place inside a single NTD sensor, an additional cut is

applied on the diﬀerence between the two heat channels of a given detector, resulting in an
eﬃciency loss smaller than 1%.

2.3 Backgrounds

We now turn to the description of all expected backgrounds encountered in or close to the
region of parameter space where the WIMP signal is expected, i.e. for energies smaller than
∼ 20 keVee,ﬁd. For each background component, a model was derived before unblinding,
using data sidebands that do not overlap with the WIMP signal region.

A nuclear recoil induced by the residual neutron background is indistinguishable from a
WIMP-related signal, in the case when a single ﬁducial interaction is recorded and the recoil
energy is similar to that expected from WIMPs. Simulations show that the muon-induced
single NR background for the selected data is 0.45 ± 0.03 (stat) +0.14−0.09 (syst) events, in good
agreement with the number of detected muon-induced events. Given the high eﬃciency of
the muon veto > 93 %, the resulting background after rejection of events in coincidence with
muon veto hits is expected to be < 0.04 counts at 90% CL for the selected data set [33].
Multiple scatters in the NR region were monitored during the WIMP search run using
all available detectors. Nine nuclear recoils in the 10 − 100 keV range were observed in
coincidence with another detector, but not with the muon veto, in a 1309 kg-days exposure.
Simulations involving all known sources of radiogenic neutrons [26] cannot reproduce such
a number, thus hinting at another, yet unknown source of neutrons. Simulations show that
the spectral shape of the neutron-induced nuclear recoil distribution is quite robust with
respect to the location of the neutron source, and can be approximated in the 2 − 20 keV
energy range by a double exponential law. Moreover, simulations indicate that the ratio of
single over multiple events in the 10 − 100 keV range is 0.45 for our detector conﬁguration,
with little dependence on the exact location of the neutron source. We therefore built an
empirical model for our ﬁducial, single radiogenic neutron-induced NRs which consists in a
double-exponential energy distribution, normalised according to the observed multiple events
and the expected single over multiple count ratio. The systematics on the intensity of this

Radioactive contamination associated for example to radon daughters at the surface of
the detectors, or the surface of materials in direct view, generate a signiﬁcant amount of
low-energy beta radiation and lead recoils recorded as surface events. The associated charge
deposition on the ﬁducial and veto electrodes of a given detector side has typical ionisation
yields of 0.4 for betas, and 0 or 0.1 for lead recoils (depending on whether the recoil hits an
electrode or the surface between electrodes). It is diﬃcult to predict the energy spectrum of
these events from ab-initio simulations due to large uncertainties, e.g.
in the implantation
depth of radioactive contaminations or in the charge collection of very low energy surface
betas. Instead, we measured directly the beta and lead ionisation yields and energy spectra
for each detector side by selecting events according to their ionisation topology. We deﬁne
top (resp. bottom) side events by requiring signals more than 5 σ (baseline noise) on the
electrodes associated to the relevant detector side. Example distributions are shown on
Fig. 3 in the case of the top side for FID825. For betas, the spectra were adjusted to spline
functions down to 4 keVee,ﬁd heat signal, and then extrapolated down to 0 keV. For lead
recoils with non-zero ionisation yield, we used the sum of a gaussian and ﬂat distribution to
adjust their spectra and extrapolate them down to 0 keV. Using these parameterizations, the
average event rates in the 927 detector-days exposure used for WIMP search are 20.1 betas
per kg-day and 4.5 lead recoils with non-zero ionisation yield per kg-day. Lead recoils with
null ionisation yield cannot be distinguished from the heat-only events that we describe in the
last paragraph of this Section. The dominant uncertainty on this surface event background
parameterization comes from the low-energy extrapolation of the β-induced spectrum. We
model the related systematics by either assuming that the spectrum is ﬂat below 4 keVee,ﬁd,
or that its slope is doubled with respect to the reference extrapolation. These extreme
assumptions propagate into a ±30 % associated systematic error in the predicted numbers
after all cuts described in Sect. 3.1 for a MX = 5 GeV/c2 WIMP search.

Apart from this surface radioactivity, the low-energy electron recoil background consists
in a set of cosmogenic activation lines, together with a continuous component associated to
Compton scattering and to tritium beta decay [34]. The cosmogenic lines of relevance here are
the aforementioned K-shell triplet in the range 9.0−10.4 keV, the corresponding L-shell lines,
and a set of other lines with lower intensities in the 5.0 − 7.7 keV range. Depending on their
location inside the detector and on their multiplicity, these interactions can generate diﬀerent
ionisation signal topologies: purely ﬁducial events with charges on both ﬁducial electrodes,
near-surface events with charges on the ﬁducial and veto electrodes of a given side, and
triple events with charges on both ﬁducial electrodes and one veto. For each of these event
categories, a model electron recoil spectrum is derived using the measured energy distribution
in the 3 − 12 keVee,ﬁd range. It is extrapolated to lower energy under the assumption that
the continuous component is ﬂat below 8 keV, and that the L/K electron capture intensity
ratio is 0.11 [35]. For our WIMP-search data, the average low-energy continuous ER ﬁducial
background is 0.18 counts per kg-day per keVee,ﬁd. The average background expected from L-
shell lines is 0.79 counts per kg-day. There are several sources of uncertainty for this ﬁducial
ER background, whose impacts are similar: the expected L/K ratio, statistical ﬁt errors,
systematics in our trigger eﬃciency model and assumptions on the shape of the continuous
component. Simulations show that the total systematic error on the number of ﬁducial ER
events in the energy range of interest for a 5 GeV/c2 WIMP search is ±16 %.

An additional source of background consists in a large number of ”heat-only” events,

search data. Continuous (resp. dashed) lines represent the ﬁt (resp. extrapolation) to the model as

with a signiﬁcant heat signal but no associated ionisation except gaussian noise. The shape
of the energy distribution for these events is observed to be independent of the detector

and time, and is well described by a double-exponential distribution, dominated by a term
proportionnal to e−E/3 keVee,ﬁd. Below 1 − 2 keVee,ﬁd (depending on the heat noise), this
population overlaps with that of pure noise events, which are recorded when the acquisition
triggers on a baseline ﬂuctuation. The rate of heat-only events is very variable as a function
of both detector and time. Above 3 keVee,ﬁd, it varies from 1 up to 100 events per day
and per detector. The origin of heat-only events is still under investigation, but they are
potentially associated with cracks taking place at the level of individual detector’s holders,
in a similar way to that described in [36]. To model the distributions in rate and in amplitude
of these events in each detector, we used the observed distribution of events with negative
total ionisation signal. Using WIMP signal simulations as described in Sect.. 3.1, it was
checked that above 1 keVee,ﬁd, this sample does not overlap with potential WIMP signals.
While the origin of these heat-only events is still not fully determined, the systematics on the
data-driven background model is well controlled thanks to the large sideband data available.
We found that the strongest source of uncertainty comes from a small cross-talk between heat
and ﬁducial ionisation channels, at the level of 0.0 − 0.7 % depending on the detector, which
biases the observed ionisation distribution of these events towards positive values, with an
energy-dependent bias. In the worst case, after all cuts described in Sect. 3.1 in a search for
a 5 GeV/c2 WIMP, simulations show that the heat-only background could be larger by 17%.

3 WIMP search

3.1 Search procedure

The WIMP search procedure consists in a set of cuts determined using simulations of our
background model and the expected signal, for each WIMP mass in the interval 4−30 GeV/c2.
After applying the cuts, a simple event counting is performed without background subtrac-
tion. All the cuts were deﬁned before unblinding the data in the region of interest.

First of all, analysis thresholds on heat energies are chosen such that the corresponding
average trigger eﬃciency is at least 70% at the threshold level, in order to reduce the impact
on the uncertainties in the modeling of the trigger. For four of the detectors this analysis
threshold is 1 keVee,ﬁd and for the four others it is 1.5 keVee,ﬁd. In addition, the following pre-
selection fully deﬁnes the experimental region of interest (RoI) on which the WIMP search is
focused: a positive total ionisation signal, a signal of less than 5 σ of baseline ﬂuctuations on
either veto electrodes, heat signal smaller than 12 keVee,ﬁd and ionisation less than 8 keVee,ﬁd.
For each detector, a large amount of WIMP signal and background events are simulated
within this RoI. Each simulated event consists in a set of 4 ionisation energies, one combined
heat signal and a time-related variable which allows to connect to the rate of heat-only events
at the time of the event. The time-varying noise of individual channels as well as online trigger
eﬃciency are taken into account. All background event populations are extracted according
to the models described in Section 2. WIMP-induced events within the ﬁducial volume are
simulated assuming a NR spectrum as derived from [37] with standard halo parameters. We
use the NR quenching parametrization QNR = α Eβ
R of Ref. [20], where ER is the recoil
energy in keV, α = 0.16 and β = 0.18, as it provides a good description of the AmBe neutron
calibration data of the detectors. For each detector and WIMP mass, both simulated signal
and background events are used to train a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm, which
allows to reduce these diﬀerent features into a single discriminating variable [38] normalized
between −1 (background-like) and +1 (signal-like).

The eﬃciency of successive cuts on the expected WIMP-induced NRs is illustrated in
Fig. 5. For an event selection tuned to MX = 20 GeV/c2, the BDT keeps mostly recoils in
the 6 to 15 keV (true NR) energy range. The former value corresponds to the threshold for
the eﬃcient rejection of gamma and heat-only backgrounds, while the latter corresponds to
the rejection of the harder spectrum associated to the neutron background. The eﬃciency in
the quoted range is 87%. For a selection tuned to MX = 5 GeV/c2, the eﬃciency loss below
3 keV (NR scale) is mostly driven by the heat analysis threshold. Due to the soft recoil
spectrum associated to low WIMP masses, only detectors with the 1 keVee,ﬁd heat analysis

score is positive. Colored contours represent the simulated distribution of 5 GeV/c2 WIMP-induced

threshold yield a signiﬁcant eﬃciency. The stringent BDT cut then keeps only a ﬁfth of
all recoils in the 3 − 4 keV (NR) range. The selection criteria derived by the BDT at low
mass are better understood by studying its response to the neutron-induced nuclear recoils
observed by exposing the detector to an AmBe source, illustrated in Fig. 6. Only the lowest-
energy NR events acquire high BDT scores.
In addition, the BDT favors events slightly
above the average QNR curve.
Indeed, while nuclear recoils lie at roughly equal distance
from the heat-only (Q = 0) and ﬁducial ER (Q = 1), in WIMP-search data the intensity of
the former exceeds largely that of the ER that are mostly due to the L-shell cosmic activation
lines. Therefore, the BDT naturally shifts the WIMP-search region towards slightly higher
ionisation yields.

An additional consequence of the discrimination against the heat-only background is
that most of the eﬃciency at low WIMP mass comes from the detector with the best ionisation
resolution (FID825). This contrasts with the selection cuts tuned to MX = 20 GeV/c2, which
result in a balanced share of sensitivity between all eight detectors.

3.2 Results

The event distributions after unblinding are illustrated in Fig. 4 in terms of BDT output,
and in Fig. 7 in the heat vs ﬁducial ionisation plane. Both the very high-statistics heat-
only event population and L-shell lines between 1.1 and 1.3 keV are visible on Fig. 7, with

the background-only hypothesis, given the Poisson statistics and gaussian systematic errors.
While Fig. 4 shows that the overall agreement between simulations and data in terms of BDT
distributions is excellent, we observe slight excesses of events after the BDT cut for all WIMP
masses. These excesses are associated to diﬀerent events depending on the WIMP mass. For
MX = 20 GeV/c2, the four candidates come from three diﬀerent detectors. They lie close to
the QNR line, as shown in Fig. 7 (bottom). For MX = 5 GeV/c2, 9 events are left as WIMP
candidates, all of them in the 1− 1.7 keVee,ﬁd heat energy range. The strongest excess in the
whole 4 − 30 GeV/c2 mass range is for MX = 7 GeV/c2, for which WIMP candidates from
both the 5 and 20 GeV/c2 WIMP searches combine to yield a 1.1% p-value.

We set a Poisson limit based only on the observed event count. The corresponding
90% CL limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-section is shown in Fig. 8 as a
function of MX , together with the expected sensitivity and its 1 σ and 2 σ uncertainty bands
related to Poisson statistics and background systematics.

Figure 8. Red curve: 90% CL limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-section obtained
in this work. The green (resp. yellow) band represents the expected 1σ (resp. 2σ) sensitivity region in
the absence of a signal. The yellow, blue, pink and brown contours are respectively from CoGeNT [10],
CDMS-Si [12], CRESST-II [11] and DAMA [9]. We also represent other limits by EDELWEISS-II [18]
(dashed red), LUX [15] (green), DAMIC [40] (blue), CRESST [41] (pink), CDMSLite [42] (dashed
violet) and SuperCDMS [16] (violet).

The following eﬀects could aﬀect the expected WIMP signal, and therefore the result-
ing limit. First, WIMP-induced interactions taking place outside the ﬁducial volume could
enhance the low-mass WIMP sensitivity, since the ﬁducial volume selection rejects fewer sur-
face events as ionisation signals become comparable to the ionisation resolution. Dedicated
simulations demonstrate that the sensitivity gain is of the order of 1−2%. Systematics in our
trigger eﬃciency model may aﬀect the WIMP sensitivity by up to 5% for MX = 5 GeV/c2.

Finally, since our analysis threshold is calibrated in keVee,ﬁd and the WIMP search region for
low masses is biased towards high quenching factors, uncertainties on the NR quenching fac-
tor are expected to impact the WIMP sensitivity especially for low WIMP masses. Neutron
calibration data taken with FID detectors are compatible with our reference parametrization
QNR = 0.16 E0.18
over the whole energy range of interest, with an estimated uncertainty at
the level of 5%. Simulations demonstrate that a ±5 % change in the quenching implies a
±20 % change in the sensitivity to 5 GeV/c2 WIMPs, and ±4 % for MX > 10 GeV/c2.

R

The excess of events above the expected background for MX > 10 GeV/c2 is proba-
bly associated to neutrons, since they are the dominant expected background in this case,
with large uncertainty, and the observed events have ionisation yields very close to QNR.
However, for MX ≤ 7 GeV/c2, three candidate events appear hardly compatible with the ex-
pected dominant backgrounds which consist of heat-only events and ﬁducial electron recoils.
They are visible for MX = 5 GeV/c2 as the three highest-energy candidates on Fig. 7 (top).
The post-unblinding investigations on their origin revealed a plausible additional source of
background: calibrations with 210Pb sources on FID detectors suggest that up to 5% of the
β background could appear as triple-electrode events, in which both ﬁducial electrodes are
hit in addition to a veto electrode. Unlike triple-electrode events from the γ-ray background,
they were not anticipated before unblinding. Depending on the assumed sharing of charge
between the three electrodes, these Q ∼ 0.4 events may become undistinguishable from ﬁdu-
cial nuclear recoils at very low energy. Basic simulations support this scenario and conﬁrm
that the leaking events would have energies and ﬁducial ionisation yields similar to these
three candidates. This would add up to 1.5 events to the expected background for the event
selection tuned to MX = 5 GeV/c2, resulting in a total expected background of 7.6 events
and a p-value of 43%. The lowest p-value, still for MX = 7 GeV/c2, would then be 2.3%.

4 Conclusions and outlook

In this article, the data recorded with an array of FID bolometers during a long background
run at the LSM are used to set constraints on the scattering of 4 − 30 GeV/c2 mass dark
matter particles with nucleons. During this ﬁrst physics run for these newly developed
detectors, they proved to be fully functional, both in terms of stability during long physics
runs, and in terms of background rejection. Their remarkable capability for an ionisation-
based ﬁducial selection at very low energies permits to reach very low levels of radioactive
backgrounds down to 0.18 events per kg-day per keV within the ﬁducial volume of each
detector. For the ﬁrst time, all backgrounds relevant to the WIMP search were precisely
modelled using data-driven parameterizations. These models were in turn used in order
to optimize the WIMP-search region of experimental parameter space.
In this study, a
conservative constraint on the WIMP-nucleon cross-section is derived in a blind analysis,
without any form of background subtraction. In a forthcoming publication [43], we will use
the full knowledge of our background in order to carry out a likelihood adjustment of our
data, and better constrain a potential WIMP signal.

After unblinding, we found that the distribution of our data in the WIMP-search re-
gion was in reasonable agreement with the background models given their systematics. The
corresponding p-values associated to event counting range from 1.1 to 22%. Subsequently,
as illustrated on Fig. 8, spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-sections are ex-
cluded at 90% CL above 4.3 × 10−40 cm2 (resp. 9.4 × 10−44 cm2) for MX = 5 GeV/c2 (resp.
MX = 20 GeV/c2).

The main sensitivity limitation of this search for WIMPs with MX < 10 GeV/c2 is
related to the presence of an intense background of heat-only events. These events prevent
us to be sensitive to potential WIMP-induced recoils for which the deposited energy is large
enough to be triggered by heat channels, but the quenching too small to generate a detectable
ﬁducial ionisation signal. Consequently, a major priority of the experiment is to strongly
reduce this background which is most probably of mechanical origin. Several tests are ongoing
making use of diﬀerent mechanical supports for the detectors. The reduction of the ionisation
noise, potentially using HEMT ampliﬁers [44, 45], will also alleviate this issue.

The results presented here constitute a major improvement with respect to the previous
EDELWEISS-II low-mass WIMP search from [18]. The derived limit is lower by a factor of
12 for MX = 10 GeV/c2, and by a factor of 41 for MX = 7 GeV/c2. This is related to an
increased exposure and better baseline noises, especially for the ionisation channels, which
enable to be sensitive to lower nuclear recoil energies. Our exclusion limit is in strong tension
with previous indications for a potentially WIMP-induced signals, as seen in [9–12]. Our
result is therefore a complementary conﬁrmation of the latest LUX [15] and SuperCDMS [16]
studies.
