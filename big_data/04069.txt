for
their detection in a semiconductor nanowire
coupled to a superconductor4,5, several electron
transport experiments reported characteristic
Majorana signatures6–10. The prime challenge
to strengthen these signatures and unravel the
predicted topological properties of Majoranas
is to reduce the remaining disorder in this
hybrid system. First of all, disorder at or near
a superconductor-semiconductor interface can
mimic some of the zero-energy signatures of
Majoranas11–15. Moreover, disorder can result in
states at ﬁnite energy but still inside the induced
superconducting energy gap16. This so-called
soft-gap renders the topological properties ex-
perimentally inaccessible17,18. Here, we report
signiﬁcant improvements in reducing both types
of disorder. From structural and chemical anal-
yses, we show a high-quality interface between
an InSb nanowire and a NbTiN superconductor.
The low-temperature properties demonstrate
ballistic transport based on observing a quan-
tized conductance for normal carriers and a
strong enhancement of conductance resulting
from Andreev reﬂection. Gate tuning the device
to a tunnel probe reveals an induced hard -gap
with a strongly reduced subgap density of states.
Spatial control of carrier density using local
gates and an application of a magnetic ﬁeld
induces a zero bias peak that is rigid over a large
region in the parameter space of gate voltage and
magnetic ﬁeld. These observations are consistent
with the Majorana theory, and exclude alter-
native explanations based on disorder related
eﬀects.

Good electrical contact between a superconductor and
semiconductor opens a gap in the semiconductor den-
sity of states generally referred to as the induced su-

perconducting gap, ∆∗. The size of ∆∗ depends sensi-
tively on the transparency between the two materials.
Spatial variations in this transparency result in spatial
variations of the gap leading to a residual subgap den-
sity of states when averaged over a larger region16. In
a topological superconductor these subgap states can in-
teract with the zero-energy states, eﬀectively destroying
the topological properties of these Majorana modes17,18.
Interface properties were dramatically improved in a re-
cent demonstration of epitaxial growth of an Al super-
conductor on an InAs nanowire, resulting in a strongly
reduced subgap density of states19. Further studies on
this materials combination indeed showed improved Ma-
jorana signatures20. The InAs nanowire itself still con-
tains residual disorder showing up in transport as unin-
tentional quantum dots14,15,19. As an alternative mate-
rials system we have further developed the combination
of InSb nanowires with NbTiN as our preferred choice of
superconductor. InSb is in general cleaner (i.e. higher
electron mobility21–23) than InAs. Moreover, InSb has
a ∼ 5 times larger g-factor, bringing down the required
external magnetic ﬁeld needed to induce the topologi-
cal phase transition. Our preference for NbTiN relies on
its high critical magnetic ﬁeld (type-II), exceeding the
10 Tesla scale.

Here we present a nanofabrication recipe yielding
largely improved InSb-NbTiN interfaces. We report on
seven devices with diﬀerent geometries all showing con-
sistent results. An overview of all the devices is given
in Supplementary Figures 3 and 4. Figure 1a shows
a basic nanowire device consisting of a normal contact
(Au), a nanowire (InSb) and a superconducting contact
(NbTiN). This device was ﬁrst measured at low temper-
ature showing high-quality electron transport (data dis-
cussed below). After, the device was sliced open (using
focused ion beam) and inspected sideways in a transmis-
sion electron microscope. The hexagonal facet structure
of the nanowire is clearly visible (Figure 1c and Supple-
mentary Figure 1). Except for the bottom facet that
rests on the substrate, the polycrystalline superconduc-
tor covers the nanowire all around without creating any
visible voids.

The precise procedure for contact deposition is ex-
tremely important. First the native oxide at the InSb
surface is wet-etched using a Sulfur-based solution fol-

lowed by an Argon etch of suﬃciently low-power to avoid
damaging the InSb surface (see Methods). The inclu-
sion of Sulfur at the interface results in band bending
with electron accumulation near the surface of InSb (see
Supplementary Figure 2). Superconducting ﬁlm deposi-
tion starts with NbTi, a reactive metal whose inclusion
as a wetting layer is crucial to create a good electrical
contact. Figure 1d (details in Supplementary Figure 1)
shows that our cleaning and deposition procedure leaves
the InSb crystal structure intact. We detect a thin segre-
gation layer (∼ 2 nm) between the polycrystalline NbTi
and single crystalline InSb. The chemical analyses (Fig-
ure 1e and f) show materials content in agreement with
our deposition procedure. More importantly, the inclu-
sion of Sulfur is clearly visible at the interface whereas
the original native oxide is completely absent.

The high-quality structural properties in Figure 1 re-
sult in largely improved electronic properties. Figure 2a
shows the diﬀerential conductance dI/dV while varying
the bias voltage V between the normal and superconduct-
ing contacts, and stepping the gate voltage Vgate applied
to the global back gate (Figure 1b). We ﬁrst of all note
that throughout the entire gate voltage range in Figure 2
we do not observe signs of the formation of unintentional
quantum dots or any other localization eﬀects resulting
from potential ﬂuctuations. Instead, we observe conduc-
tance plateaus at 2e2/h for all devices, i.e. typical for
ballistic transport and a clear signature of a disorder-
free device. For a suﬃciently negative gate voltage the
non-covered nanowire section between normal and super-
conducting contacts is depleted and serves as a tunnel
barrier. A vertical line cut from this regime is plotted in
the lower panel of Figure 2b, showing a trace typical for
an induced superconducting gap with a strong conduc-
tance suppression for small V . The extracted gap value
is ∆∗ = 0.8 meV. Increasing Vgate ﬁrst lowers and then
removes the tunnel barrier completely. A vertical line
cut from this open regime is plotted in the upper panel
in Figure 2b. In this case, the conductance for small V
is enhanced compared to the value above ∼ 1 mV. Note
that the range in V showing an enhanced conductance in
the upper panel corresponds to the same range showing
the induced gap in the lower panel. The enhancement
results from Andreev processes where an incoming elec-
tron reﬂects as a hole at the NS interface generating a
Cooper pair24. This Andreev process eﬀectively doubles
the charge being transported from e to 2e enhancing the
subgap conductance. In Figure 2b the observed enhance-
ment is by a factor ∼ 1.5.

The Andreev enhancement is also visible in horizontal
line cuts as shown in Figure 2c. The above-gap conduc-
tance (black trace) taken for |V | = 2 mV represents the
conductance for normal carriers, Gn. The subgap con-
ductance, Gs, near V = 0 (Figure 2c, red trace) again
shows an Andreev enhancement in the plateau region.
The panels in Figure 2d and e show exemplary traces
from two other devices. The enhancement in Figure 2d
reaches 1.9 × 2e2/h, very close to the theoretical limit:

2

an enhancement factor of 2 in the case of a perfect in-
terface. The plateau in Gn in Figure 2e is particularly
ﬂat whereas Gs shows a pronounced dip on the right-
side of the plateau. The dip structure provides a handle
for estimating the remaining disorder by a comparison to
theory, as discussed below.

The theory for electronic transport from a normal con-
ductor via a quantum point contact to a superconductor
was developed by Beenakker24. The subgap conductance
is described by Andreev reﬂections, and for a single sub-
band given by Gs = 4e2/h × T 2/(2 − T )2. The gate
voltage dependent transmission probability T can be ex-
tracted from the measured above-gap conductance, given
by Gn = 2e2/h × T . Figure 3a shows excellent agree-
ment between the calculated and measured subgap con-
ductance up to the point where the measured Andreev
enhancement is reduced causing the dip on the right side
of the plateau. A numerical modelling (details in Supple-
mentary Information) ﬁnds that the dip is caused by a
mixing between the ﬁrst and the second subband due to
residual disorder. Even for weak disorder, mode mixing is
strongly enhanced near the opening of the next channel,
due to the van Hove singularity at the subband bottom.
Hence, the Andreev conductance will generically exhibit
a dip close to the next conductance step, instead of a
perfect doubling. We ﬁnd good agreement with our data
(compare Figures 2e and f) for a mean free path of sev-
eral µm. Given that our proximitized nanowire length is
about 1 µm, this implies ballistic transport of Andreev
pairs.

transport

inside

Besides deducing ballistic

the
nanowire, the Andreev enhancement allows for extract-
ing the highest transmission, which sets a lower bound
on the interface transparency. An enhancement factor
of 1.4 implies T > 0.9 and our record value of 1.9 gives
T > 0.98 (see Methods). The comparison between Gs
versus Gn can be continued into the regime of an in-
creasing tunnel barrier. Figures 3c and d show traces of
dI/dV for successively lower conductances. The subgap
conductance suppression reaches Gs/Gn ∼ 1/50, a value
comparable to the results obtained with epitaxial Al19.
A comparison between the measured subgap conductance
and Beenakker’s theory (without any ﬁt parameters) is
shown in Figure 3b. The excellent agreement over three
orders of magnitude in conductance implies that the sub-
gap conductance is very well described by Andreev pro-
cesses and no other transport mechanisms are involved19.
The lowest conductance (∼ 5 · 10−4 × 2e2/h) reaches our
measurement limit, causing the deviation from theory.
The inset to Figure 3b shows how the subgap conduc-
tance increases when applying a magnetic ﬁeld, which
can be expected qualitatively since Beenakker’s theory
requires time reversal symmetry. A quantitative under-
standing of such magnetic ﬁeld induced subgap trans-
port, although very important, is outside the scope of
this Letter.

The absence of unintentional quantum dots,

the
observed hard gap, quantized conductance and high

interface-transparency all result from our improved fabri-
cation process. These advances have been included in de-
vices with local gate electrodes that allow for a separate
tuning of the chemical potential in the wire section un-
derneath the superconducting contact independent from
the tunnel barrier.

This spatial gate tunability allows us to explore the
Majorana regime. Figure 4a shows an electron micro-
graph of a typical device where the three individual gates
tune the electron density below the normal and supercon-
ducting contacts as well as the tunnel barrier. After tun-
ing these gate voltages we ﬁnd a regime (Figure 4b) where
increasing the magnetic ﬁeld closes the induced gap and
induces a zero bias peak (ZBP) rigidly bound to V = 0 up
to at least 1 Tesla. The gap closure observed at 0.38 T
is expected to occur when ∆∗ ∼ Ez yielding g ∼ 40,
extracted from linear interpolation, which matches inde-
pendent measurements23. Converting the magnetic ﬁeld
B axis into a Zeeman energy scale, we ﬁnd that the ZBP
is bound to zero over an energy range that is an order
of magnitude larger than the peak width (the full width
at half maximum, FWHM ∼ 0.05 meV). This excludes a
normal level-crossing as the origin for our ZBP. We note
that the maximum ratio of ZBP-range/FWHM we have
ever measured is close to two orders of magnitude25.

The ZBP can be spatially resolved by varying the volt-
ages applied on individual gates. Figure 4c shows that
the ZBP exists only over a ﬁnite range in voltage applied
to the super gate, meaning that proper tuning of the elec-
tron density underneath the superconducting contact is
essential for the appearance of the ZBP. Figure 4d shows
that changing the tunnel barrier conductance by more
than a factor of three does not split the ZBP, nor makes
it disappear. This implies that the ZBP does not result
from physics occurring in or around the tunnel barrier
(e.g. due to the ’0.7 anomaly’26 or from a weak antilo-
calization eﬀect12). Figure 4e shows that a large varia-
tion in the voltage on the normal gate can modulate the
overall conductance (e.g. aﬀect interferences) but it does
not remove the ZBP. The combined panels Figures 4c-e
demonstrate that the ZBP originates on the supercon-
ducting side.

Diﬀerent devices show diﬀerences in the detailed trans-
port properties but the general behavior shown in Fig-
ure 4 is reproduced in all our devices with properly work-
ing contacts and local gate electrodes. Figure 5 illustrates
the behavior of a device similar to the one in Figure 4a
but with an induced gap signiﬁcantly larger than the de-
vice in Figure 4. As a result, the induced gap closes at a
higher magnetic ﬁeld. In this example the ZPB is visible
and un-split over a range in Zeeman energy larger than
1.5 meV. The FWHM is around 0.05 meV yielding a ratio
ZBP-range/FWHM ∼ 30. We again ﬁnd that the ZBP is
robust against a change in the barrier gate voltage which,
in this case, changes the conductance over more than an
order of magnitude (see Supplementary Figure 7).

In conclusion, the presented experiments demonstrate
rigid zero bias peaks that are stable over an extended

3

range in Zeeman energy and gate voltage in devices that
show clear ballistic transport behavior. These observa-
tions exclude explanations for our zero bias peaks that
are based on quantum conﬁnement14, Kondo eﬀects15,
or disorder11–13. We know of no theoretical framework
other than those based on Majorana fermions that is con-
sistent with our observations.

Methods

Nanowire growth and device fabrication. InSb
nanowires have been grown by Au-catalyzed Vapor-
Liquid-Solid mechanism in a Metal Organic Vapor Phase
Epitaxy reactor. The InSb nanowire crystal direc-
tion is [111] zinc blende,
free of stacking faults and
dislocations27. Nanowires are deposited one-by-one using
a micro-manipulator on a substrate covered with 285 nm
thick SiO2 serving as a gate dielectric for back gated
devices. For local gated devices, extra set of bottom
gates are patterned on the substrate followed by trans-
fer of h-BN (∼ 30 nm thick) onto which nanowires are
deposited. Contact deposition process starts with resist
development followed by Oxygen plasma cleaning. Then,
the chip is immersed in a Sulfur-rich ammonium sulﬁde
solution diluted by water (with a ratio of 1:200) at 60 ◦C
for half an hour28. At all stages care is taken to ex-
pose the solution to air as little as possible. For normal
metal contacts, the chip is placed into an evaporator. A
30 second Helium ion milling is performed in-situ before
evaporation of Cr/Au (10 nm/125 nm) at a base pressure
< 10−7 mbar. For superconducting contacts, the chip is
mounted in a sputtering system. After 5 seconds of in-
situ Ar plasma etching at a power of 25 Watts and an Ar
pressure of 10 mTorr, 5 nm NbTi is sputtered followed by
85 nm NbTiN.

Measurement setup and data analysis. All the
data in this Letter is measured in a dilution refrigerator
with a base temperature around 50 mK using several
stages of ﬁltering. The determination of the Andreev
enhancement factor depends sensitively on the contact
resistance subtracted from the measured data. In all our
analysis we only subtract a ﬁxed-value series resistance
of 0.5 kOhm solely to account for the contact resistance
of the normal metal lead. This value is smaller than
the lowest contact resistance we have ever obtained for
InSb nanowire devices22,23, which makes the values for
the interface transparency a lower bound.

Structure characterization. The cross-section and
lamella for TEM investigations were prepared by focused
ion beam (FIB). FIB milling was carried out with a FEI
Nova Nanolab 600i Dualbeam with a Ga ion beam fol-
lowing the standard procedure29. We used electron in-
duced Co and Pt deposition for protecting the region of
interest and a ﬁnal milling step at 5 kV to limit dam-
age to the lamella. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and
scanning TEM (STEM) analyses were conducted using
a JEM ARM200F aberration-corrected TEM operated

at 200 kV. For the chemical analysis, energy dispersive
X-ray (EDX) measurements were carried out using the
same microscope equipped with a 100 mm2 EDX silicon
drift detector (SSD).

Characterization of NbTiN. Our NbTiN ﬁlms
are deposited using an ultrahigh vacuum AJA Inter-
national ATC 1800 sputtering system (base pressure
∼ 10−9 Torr). We use a Nb0.7Ti0.3 wt. % target with

a diameter of 3 inches. Reactive sputtering resulting in
nitridized NbTiN ﬁlms was performed in an Ar/N pro-
cess gas with 9 at. % nitrogen content at a pressure of
2.5 mTorr using a DC magnetron sputter source at a
power of 250 Watts. An independent characterization of
the NbTiN ﬁlms gave a critical temperature of 13.3 K for
90 nm thick ﬁlms with a resistivity of 126 µOhm·cm and
a compressive stress on Si substrate.

multi-gate Majorana device (scale bar 1 µm). The three bottom gates (normal gate, barrier gate, and super gate) are covered

Supplementary Figure 1 | Structure characterization and HAADF analysis of the InSb-
NbTi-NbTiN interface. a, High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) cross-sectional image obtained by
aligning the InSb nanowire along the zone axis in the [111] orientation. b, Fast Fourier transform
(FFT) corresponding to a revealing the presence of both InSb and NbTiN. The NbTiN contribution
leads to the formation of several Bragg spots on concentric rings, which provides evidence of the
existence of several grains with diﬀerent orientations in the original image. Each ring with diﬀerent
radius corresponds to a particular value of the interplanar spacing, i.e., it is the result of the reﬂections
associated to a speciﬁc family of planes. Two diﬀerent d-spacings have been identiﬁed and measured:
d(111) = 0.249 nm and d(200) = 0.213 nm. They are indicated with yellow dashed lines in b. From
these values, it is possible to determine the NbTiN lattice parameter which we obtain to be 0.430 nm.
On the other hand, the six {220} reﬂections, indicated by a blue circle in the FFT, arise from the InSb
region. From the calculated interplanar value of d{220} = 0.230 nm we can estimate the InSb lattice

13

parameter to be around 0.649 nm. The obtained lattice parameters for both NbTiN and InSb are in
good agreement with the respective values reported in the literature. c, High-angle annular dark ﬁeld
(HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of the device cross-section. d,
Atomic resolution HAADF-STEM image of the interface for the region marked by the red square in
c. The highlighted area in green indicates the 2 nm deep NbTi segregation into the InSb core. This
eﬀect is in good agreement with the EDX line scan, see Figure 1f (main text), which shows the NbTi
region to be segregated 2 nm deep into the InSb core on the {220} facets. Interestingly, this value
of the fraction of Nb in InSb could lead to the formation of a half-breed ternary superconductor at
the interface, which would thus substantially improve its quality by increasing the eﬀective contact
area.

Supplementary Figure 2 | Inclusion of Sulfur creates surface accumulation by band bend-
ing. a, A schematic of the device cross-section showing both the nanowire and the contact metal.
Nanowire axis is along [111] and the hexagonal facets have <110> orientation. b, Band diagram
for an InSb surface with <110> orientation. Fermi level at the surface lies closer to valence band1.
c, Band diagram for an InSb surface with <110> orientation passivated with Sulfur-based solution.
Inclusion of Sulfur at the surface counteracts the depletion and pins the Fermi level in the conduc-
tion band. This creates an electron-rich nanowire surface. d, Gate voltage response of nanowire
devices with diﬀerent contact preparation. A ﬁnite conductance for negative gate voltages indicates
electron accumulation, highlighted in pink. Blue curve is taken from a device with contacts pre-
pared using in-situ Ar plasma etch, red curve from a device with contacts prepared using Sulfur
passivation. Both devices have identical geometries with a channel length of 150 nm. Devices with
Sulfur passivated contact areas exhibit a negative threshold voltage (red arrow), in contrast to the
devices with in-situ plasma etched contact areas (blue arrow). This typical characteristic measured
on hundreds of nanowire devices indicates the doping eﬀect of Sulfur inclusion at the InSb nanowire
surface. Black arrows indicate the 1st, the 3rd, and the 5th quantized conductance plateau2. Upper
plateaus appear at lower conductance values due to a ﬁnite contact resistance which is not subtracted
from the conductance traces shown here. We also ﬁnd that Sulfur passivated contacts show lower
contact resistances than in-situ etched contacts, which can be seen from the diﬀerence in saturation
conductance of both traces at high gate voltages.

Supplementary Figure 3 | Electron micrograph of all presented devices. N indicates the
normal metal lead, S the superconducting lead. For three terminal devices, unlabelled leads are kept
ﬂoated throughout the measurements. Scale bars for all images indicate 1 µm. For devices E and
F, the three gate electrodes underneath the superconducting contact are connected together in the
external circuit. Data in Figure 2e (main text) is taken by sweeping the barrier gate underneath the
uncovered wire section.

Supplementary Figure 4 | Ballistic transport for all devices with global back gate. a-d,
Diﬀerential conductance of device A to D is shown in colour scale (left) and in height (right) as a
function of bias and gate voltage at zero magnetic ﬁeld. All devices show quantized conductance,
Andreev enhancement and an induced superconducting gap of 0.9 mV (A), 0.8 mV (B), 0.6 mV (C)
and 0.85 mV (D). Unintentional quantum dots are absent in all devices. Correspondence with the
ﬁgures in main text: data in Figure 1 and Figures 3b-d taken on device A, Figures 2a-c on device
B, Figure 2d on device C, Figure 3a on device D.

Supplementary Figure 5 | Theoretical simulation of our devices. a, Theoretical model: a
cylindrical nanowire (black, gray, white) with length LN+ L (100 nm + 800 nm), where the latter
part is partially coated by a superconductor leaving the bottom surface uncovered. (Scheme shows
L = 100 nm for clarity.) The wire radius R is 40 nm and the superconducting ﬁlm has a thickness
Rs = 10 nm. The wire is terminated from both sides with inﬁnite leads (pink). Front lead is normal,
back lead is normal/superconductor. Each little circle represents a three dimensional mesh site with
a size of 7 nm. White circles depict a potential barrier with a width W = 60 nm in the uncovered
wire section forming a quantum point contact (QPC). Gray circles represent the smoothness of the
barrier which is set to 5 nm. b, Simulated diﬀerential conductance for diﬀerent disorder strengths
with mean free path le ranging from 1 µm (top) to 20 µm (bottom). The tunnelling conductance
is shown on the left and the plateau regime on the right. For short le, the Andreev enhancement

is lower than that observed in our measurements and disorder-induced conductance ﬂuctuations
dominate the conductance for above-gap bias which we do not observe in our measurements. A
good correspondence with the measurements is found for le > 2.5 µm. We note that the details
of the peak-dip structure in the Andreev conductance depend on several additional parameters of
the system (e.g. barrier smoothness or disorder realization). In contrast, we ﬁnd the conductance
ﬂuctuations above the gap to depend mainly on disorder strength, so that the combined analysis
can be used as an estimate for the mean free path. The four symmetric peaks outside the gap
around V ∼ ±1 mV indicate the induced superconducting gap for the higher two subbands (three
subbands are occupied in total). Asymmetric conductance for diﬀerent bias polarity is due to energy
dependent transmission through the tunnel barrier (see also bottom panel of c), i.e., for positive
bias V , eﬀective QPC potential is lower. c, Comparison between the measurement (device C) and
the simulation of a ballistic device with le = 10 µm. Experiment agrees well with theory indicating
a very low disorder strength for our devices. The induced superconducting gap edges for higher
subbands, visible in the simulation, are not observed in the experiment. d, Mode-mixing induced
dip in Andreev conductance. Upper panels show the measured data taken from the main text, the left
from Figure 2d and the right from Figure 2e. Lower panels show the transmission T of the ﬁrst two
i /(2 − Ti)2.
When the transmission of the second subband becomes ﬁnite, the conductance modes mix, decreasing
the Andreev enhancement. This eﬀect shows up as a dip in Gs when plotted as a function of gate
voltage Vgate.

Here YQPC is the centre position of the barrier (Supplementary Figure ??a). Barrier width is W =
60 nm, and the barrier height is controlled by VQPC. The softness of the barrier is given by λ
which we take 5 nm. VD(x, y, z) accounts for disorder, which is modelled as a spatially varying
potential with random values from a uniform distribution within a range [−U0, U0] where amplitude

U0 =(cid:112)3π/lem∗2a3 is set by mean free path le.

We approximate the superconductor covering the wire by a layer of non-zero ∆ for (x2 + z2) > R
and y > LN and z > −R. The huge wave vector diﬀerence in the superconductor and semiconductor
cannot be captured in a numerical simulation. Hence, to capture the short coherence length in
the superconductor, we take a superconducting shell of thickness RS = 10 nm and ∆ = 200 meV.
We then tune the induced gap to be close to the experimental value (∼ 0.5 meV) by reducing the
hopping between the semiconductor and the superconductor by a factor of 0.8.

The transport properties of the system are calculated using Kwant package3 with the Hamiltonian
in eq. (1) discretized on a 3D mesh with spacing a = 7 nm and inﬁnite input (normal) and output
(normal/superconducting) leads. For a given VQPC and excitation energy ε we obtain the scattering
matrix of the system from which we subsequently extract electron re(ε) and hole rh(ε) reﬂection
submatrices. Finally, we calculate thermally averaged conductance for injection energy E = eV

and G(ε) = N − (cid:107)re(ε)(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)rh(ε)(cid:107)2. We assume chemical potential to be µ = 30 meV, which gives
N = 3 spin-degenerate modes in the leads. The presented results are obtained for T = 70 mK and
InSb eﬀective mass m∗ = 0.014me.

units of 2e2/h). The typical zero bias peak height is around 0.1 × 2e2/h with a full width half
maximum around 50 µV. This suggests that the zero bias peak is not only temperature broadened
(3.5kBT ∼ 15 µeV).
