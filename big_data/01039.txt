Abstract. We give a minimum degree condition suﬃcent to ensure the existence
of a fractional Kr-decomposition in a balanced r-partite graph (subject to some
further simple necessary conditions). This generalises the non-partite problem
studied recently by Barber, Lo, K¨uhn, Osthus and the author, and the 3-partite
fractional K3-decomposition problem studied recently by Dukes. Combining our
result with recent work by Barber, K¨uhn, Lo, Osthus and Taylor, this gives a
minimum degree condition suﬃcient to ensure the existence of a (non-fractional)
Kr-decomposition in a balanced r-partite graph (subject to the same simple nec-
essary conditions).

1. Introduction

Given a graph F , we say a graph G has an F -decomposition if there is a collec-
tion of edge-disjoint copies of F in G that covers all the edges of G. The study of
F -decompositions dates back to 1847, when Kirkman [11] showed that the n-vertex
clique Kn has a K3-decomposition if and only if n ≡ 1, 3 mod 6. Much later, Wil-
son [12] was able to determine whether a complete graph Kn has an F -decomposition
for any graph F , when Kn is large compared to F . A hypergraph generalisation re-
garding the decomposition of large cliques into smaller cliques has only recently been
achieved, in a breakthrough by Keevash [10].

Progress has also recently been made by Barber, K¨uhn, Lo and Osthus [2] in
ﬁnding F -decompositions of large graphs which are not complete, but have a high
minimum degree. A key component in these new methods, as explained later, is to
ﬁrst ﬁnd a relevant fractional decomposition of the large graph. A graph G has a
fractional F -decomposition if a weighting can be given to the copies of F in G so
that each edge lies in copies of F with total weight 1. That is, if F(G) is the set of
copies of F in G, then there is a function ω : F(G) → [0, 1] so that, for each edge

e ∈ E(G), PF ∈F (G):e∈E(F ) ω(F ) = 1.

For example, any clique Kn can be seen to have a fractional Kr-decomposition
In
fact, any large graph with a suﬃciently high minimum degree has a fractional
Kr-decomposition. First shown by Yuster [13], the required minimum degree was
improved by Dukes [5, 6], before Barber, K¨uhn, Lo, Osthus and the current au-

and n0 there is, for some n ≥ n0, an n-vertex graph G with minimum degree
δ(G) ≥ (r/(r + 1) + ε)n without a fractional Kr-decomposition. In the particular
case r = 3, the minimum degree required to ensure a fractional K3-decomposition
was improved by Yuster [13], Dukes [5, 6] and Garaschuk [8], before Dross [4] proved
that any n-vertex graph G with minimum degree δ(G) ≥ 9n/10 has a fractional
K3-decomposition.

In this paper, we study the minimum degree required to ensure a fractional Kr-
decomposition of r-partite graphs, where, unlike in the non-partite case, the graph
must necessarily satisfy a further simple condition. In combination with recent work
by Barber, K¨uhn, Lo, Osthus and Taylor [3] this gives good bounds on the minimum
degree required to ensure a Kr-decomposition of r-partite graphs satisfying the same
necessary condition.

We say an r-partite graph G on a vertex partition (V1, . . . , Vr) is balanced if |V1| =
. . . = |Vr|. If such a graph G has a fractional Kr-decomposition ω : F(G) → [0, 1],
where F(G) is the set of copies of Kr in G, then for each i ∈ [r], v ∈ Vi and j ∈ [r]\{i}
we have

XK∈F (G):v∈V (K)

ω(K) = Xu∈Vj∩N (v) XK∈F (G):uv∈E(K)

ω(K) = Xu∈Vj∩N (v)

1 = d(v, Vj ),

where d(v, Vj ) is the number of neighbours of v in Vj. Therefore, if G has a fractional
Kr-decomposition then the degree of each vertex v ∈ Vi must be the same into each
other vertex class. Let us say that an r-partite graph G with partition (V1, . . . , Vr) is
Kr-divisible if it has this property, that is, if for every i, j ∈ [r] and v ∈ V (G)\(Vi∪Vj)
we have d(v, Vi) = d(v, Vj ). Thus, an r-partite graph must be Kr-divisible if it has
a fractional Kr-decomposition.

Given an r-partite graph G with partition (V1, . . . , Vr), let

ˆδ(G) = min{d(v, Vj ) : j ∈ [r], v ∈ V (G) \ Vj}.

Note that if such a graph G is Kr-divisible then the minimum degree of G is (r −
1)ˆδ(G). We will show that if G is a balanced Kr-divisible r-partite graph in which
ˆδ(G) is suﬃciently high (though potentially distinctly smaller than the size of the
vertex classes), then G has a fractional Kr-decomposition.

Theorem 1.1. Let r ≥ 3 and n ∈ N.
If G is a Kr-divisible r-partite graph on
(V1, . . . , Vr), where |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/106r3)n, then G has a
fractional Kr-decomposition.

Barber, K¨uhn, Lo and Osthus [2] have created a method of iterative absorption
capable of turning approximate F -decompositions (edge-disjoint copies of F in G
which cover most of the edges of G) of certain dense graphs into F -decompositions.
Haxell and R¨odl [9] have shown that (roughly speaking) large dense graphs with frac-
tional Kχ(F )-decompositions have approximate F -decompositions, where χ(F ) is the
chromatic number of F . Thus, a dense graph with a fractional Kχ(F )-decomposition
must have an approximate F -decomposition, and hence, subject to a simple neces-
sary condition, an F -decomposition [2]. Recently, Barber, K¨uhn, Lo, Osthus and
Taylor [3] have adapted and extended the methods in [2] in order to apply them to
r-partite graphs. In combination with Theorem 1.1, this gives the following result.

Theorem 1.2. For every r ≥ 3 and ε > 0, there exists an n0 ∈ N such that the
following holds for all n ≥ n0. If G is a Kr-divisible r-partite graph on (V1, . . . , Vr),

where |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/106r3 + ε)n, then G has a Kr-
decomposition.

Dukes [7] has shown that if a K3-divisible 3-partite graph G with n vertices in each
class satisﬁes ˆδ(G) ≥ 101n/104, then G has a fractional K3-decomposition. This is a
better bound on the required minimum degree than that given in Theorem 1.1 when
r = 3, and thus, when combined with the work of Barber, K¨uhn, Lo, Osthus and
Taylor [3], results in a better bound than that given in Theorem 1.2 when r = 3.
As noted in [7], the methods introduced by Dukes can be used more generally to
ﬁnd fractional Kr-decompositions of dense r-partite graphs when r ≥ 3. While this
gives a better bound than that given in Theorem 1.1 for small values of r, for large
values of r this will give a weaker bound [7]. In Theorem 1.2, the case where r = 3 is
particularly interesting. As a corollary we may deduce that partially completed latin
squares in which each symbol, row and column is used a limited number of times
can be completed [3, 7]. When r ≥ 4, Theorem 1.2 permits a similar deduction to
be made about the completion of r − 2 mutually orthogonal latin squares (see [3] for
details).

The r-partite version of the fractional Kr-decomposition problem can be viewed
as a generalisation of the comparable non-partite problem, in the following way.
Given a graph G with minimum degree δ(G), take r disjoint copies of V (G) to get
the vertex set of a new graph ˆG, and let two vertices from diﬀerent copies of V (G)
be connected by an edge in ˆG if there is an edge between the corresponding vertices
in G. Considering this construction, we can see that ˆG is Kr-divisible, ˆδ( ˆG) = δ(G),
and ˆG has a fractional Kr-decomposition if and only if G does. Thus, if the graph G
has a suﬃciently high minimum degree then we can apply Theorem 1.1 to ˆG to show
that G has a fractional Kr-decomposition.

To prove Theorem 1.1, we will use an idea introduced by Dross [4] and devel-
oped in a more general setting by Barber, K¨uhn, Lo, Osthus, and the author [1].
Roughly speaking, to ﬁnd a fractional Kr-decomposition of a (non-partite or r-
partite) graph G we begin by uniformly weighting the copies of Kr in G, so that
the weight on the individual edges (deﬁned as the sum of the weights of the copies
of Kr containing that edge) is on average 1. The weight on some edges will be
greater than 1, and the weight on some edges will be less than 1, but if we have
a suﬃciently strong minimum degree condition then the weight on each edge will
be close to 1 (as each edge is in a similar number of copies of Kr). Furthermore,
each copy of Kr in G has a strictly positive weight, allowing us to both increase and
decrease the weights of the copies of Kr while maintaining a non-negative weighting.
In making such changes we aim to correct the weight on each edge to get a frac-
tional Kr-decomposition. In [1], the corrections were made to the weight on each
edge e ∈ E(G) in turn, making sure that at each stage only the weight on e was
adjusted, not the weight on any other edges. To make the corrections in [1], it was
critical that in a non-partite graph with a high minimum degree each edge was in
many copies of Kr+2. As there are no copies of Kr+2 in an r-partite graph, we will
need a new method to make these adjustments. In fact, we are unable to adjust the
weight on an individual edge without changing the weight on some other edges and
we will therefore make adjustments to the weight on multiple edges simultaneously.
A sketch of our method is given in Section 2.

For each s ≥ r, we could also ask more generally what minimum degree is needed in
a balanced s-partite graph to ensure a fractional Kr-decomposition (subject perhaps

to some necessary conditions).
condition to that in Theorem 1.1 will ensure each edge is in many copies of Kr+2,
whereupon the methods in [1] can be used directly. In particular, this method could
ﬁnd a fractional Kr-decomposition using a minimum degree bound depending on r,
but not on s. When s = r + 1 the situation is more complicated, and there may
not be a simple set of divisibility conditions distinguishing which large graphs with
a high minimum degree have a fractional Kr-decomposition.

The authors of [1] developed the basic method outlined above to reduce the mini-
mum degree required in the non-partite setting. It is likely that improvements along
these lines could be made to our methods here to improve Theorem 1.1. However,
these improvements would neither introduce any new ideas nor achieve a plausibly
optimal bound, while obscuring the necessary changes due to the partite setting.
Therefore, we will limit ourselves to a brief discussion of these possibilities in Sec-
tion 6.

Barber, K¨uhn, Lo, Osthus and Taylor [3] have conjectured that the minimum
degree bound in Theorem 1.2 could be replaced by ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/(r + 1))n when n
is suﬃciently large. To show this would be optimal, they exhibited a balanced r-
partite graph G with rn vertices and ˆδ(G) = ⌈(1 − 1/(r + 1))n⌉ − 1 which has no
Kr-decomposition. The same graph also has no fractional Kr-decomposition (see [3,
Section 3.1]), and in light of this we make the following, weaker, conjecture.

Conjecture 1.3. For every r ≥ 3 there exists an n0 ∈ N such that the following
holds for all n ≥ n0. If G is a Kr-divisible graph on (V1, . . . , Vr), where |V1| = . . . =
|Vr| = n and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/(r + 1))n, then G has a fractional Kr-decomposition.

The results of Barber, K¨uhn, Lo, Osthus and Taylor [3] are suﬃciently strong that a
proof of Conjecture 1.3 would be enough to show that, for each ε > 0, any suﬃciently
large balanced Kr-divisible r-partite graph G with rn vertices and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1−1/(r+
1) + ε)n has a Kr-decomposition.

After detailing some of the notation we will use, in Section 2 we sketch the main

details of our proof before giving an overview of the rest of the paper.

1.1. Notation. We work with an r-partite graph G, on the partition (V1, . . . , Vr),
where the sets V1, . . . , Vr form a partition of V (G) and there are no edges between
any two vertices from the same set Vi, i ∈ [r] = {1, . . . , r}. We denote by Kr the
complete graph, or clique, with r vertices. We refer to the copies of Kr in the graph G
as the r-cliques in G.

For a vertex x ∈ V (G), we let N (x) = {y ∈ V (G) : xy ∈ E(G)} and N c(x) =
V (G) \ N (x). For a vertex set X ⊆ V (G) in a graph G, d(v, X) is the number
In an r-partite graph G on (V1, . . . , Vr), we let ˆδ(G) =
of neighbours of v in X.
min{d(v, Vj ) : j ∈ [r], v ∈ V (G) \ Vj}. Note that the value of ˆδ(G) depends on the
partition of G, and therefore when we use it without deﬁning a partition (V1, . . . , Vr)
we do so implicitly. For a vertex set X ⊆ V (G), we denote the graph induced
on G by X as G[X]. By a weighting of the r-cliques in G, we mean a function
ω : Kr → [0, 1], where Kr is the set of r-cliques in G, and we say the resulting weight

on an edge e ∈ E(G) is PK∈Kr:e∈E(K) ω(K).

Given functions f, g : N → [0, ∞), we say f (n) = O(g(n)) if there exists a constant
C > 0 such that f (n) ≤ Cg(n) for all n ∈ N, and we say f (n) = Θ(g(n)) if there
exist constants c, C > 0 such that cg(n) ≤ f (n) ≤ Cg(n) for all n ∈ N. Finally,

2. Proof Sketch

At the highest level, our proof follows the method introduced by Dross [4] and
developed by Barber, K¨uhn, Lo, Osthus and the author [1]. We seek a fractional
Kr-decomposition of a balanced r-partite Kr-divisible graph G in which ˆδ(G) is close
to the number of vertices in each class. We begin by uniformly weighting each copy
of Kr, or r-clique, in G, so that the weight on the individual edges (taken as the
sum of the weights of the r-cliques containing that edge) is on average 1. Due to
the minimum degree condition, each edge will be in roughly the same number of r-
cliques, so the weight on each edge will be close to 1 (as proved in Lemma 3.3). We
aim to correct the weight on each individual edge to 1, by making small adjustments
to the weight of the r-cliques. Each r-clique initially has a strictly positive weight,
so these adjustments may be positive or negative, as long as the total adjustment to
the weight of any r-clique is not too large.

We will break down the corrections needed to the weight on the edges into a
sequence of smaller corrections which alter the weight on small groups of edges.
We will make these smaller corrections using functions we call gadgets. We call
any function f : Kr → R a gadget, where Kr is the set of r-cliques in G. Adding a
gadget f to a weighting of the r-cliques will adjust the weight on each edge e ∈ E(G)

by ξe :=PK∈Kr:e∈E(K) f (K). For each i ∈ [r], v ∈ Vi and j ∈ [r] \ {i}, we have

f (K),

Xu∈N (v)∩Vj

ξuv = Xu∈N (v)∩Vj XK∈Kr:uv∈E(K)

f (K) = XK∈Kr:v∈V (K)

Pu∈N (v)∩Vj

as each r-clique contains exactly one vertex from each class. Therefore, the sum
ξuv does not depend on j. Considering this, we can see that we cannot
have a gadget that changes only the weight on one edge without altering the weight
on some other edges. In fact, we will use two diﬀerent gadgets which alter the weight
on diﬀerent collections of edges.

Our ﬁrst gadget works with distinct vertices v and v′ in some class Vi and vertices
uj ∈ Vj ∩ N (v) ∩ N (v′), j ∈ [r] \ {i}; the gadget adds weight w to (the weight
on) each edge vuj and removes weight w from each edge v′uj (see Figure 1). Our
second gadget works with distinct vertices v and v′ in some class Vi and distinct
vertices u1 and u2 in some other class Vj which are both neighbours of v and v′; the
gadget removes weight w from vu2 and v′u1 and adds weight w to vu1 and v′u2 (see
Figure 2). Using these two gadgets, for any vertex v we will be able to correct the
weight on the edges incident to v, but in doing so we will also alter the weight on
some edges incident to some other vertices in the same class as v (which take the role
of v′ in the gadgets). We think of this as moving the corrections we need to make
to other edges. There will not typically be one vertex v′ to whose incident edges we
can move all the corrections from the edges incident to v, as not all the neighbours
of v will be neighbours of some vertex v′.

We wish to move the required corrections to an area of the graph where they will
be easier to make. Picking one speciﬁc r-clique K from G, we aim to move the
corrections onto the edges of K, where, as the sum of the corrections to be made
is 0, they will naturally cancel out. Using our gadgets, we cannot typically move the

6

RICHARD MONTGOMERY

corrections required to the edges around each vertex v onto the edges incident to the
vertex v′ in K which is in the same class as v. Instead, where the class containing v
is Vi, we will move the corrections required to the edges incident to many diﬀerent
vertices in Vi, where the vertices in Vi will be chosen to be neighbours of every
vertex in V (K) \ Vi. Once we have done this for every vertex v in the graph we will
then use a second round of movements to move the corrections onto the edges of K,
where they will naturally cancel out to give a fractional Kr-decomposition. Finally,
to ensure the above scheme does not alter the weight of one clique unduly much, we
will take the average of the resulting gadget over all the r-cliques K in the graph.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 3, we show that each
edge in our graph is in roughly the same number of r-cliques.
In Section 4, we
construct our two gadgets and break down the required corrections to the weight
on the edges from the initial weighting into smaller corrections that can be made
using the gadgets. In Section 5, we use this to move the required corrections onto
the edges of an r-clique K, before averaging the resulting gadget over each diﬀerent

r-clique K to prove Theorem 1.1. In Section 6, we discuss possible improvements to
Theorem 1.1.

When discussing these techniques, we will always have in mind a Kr-divisible
r-partite graph G on (V1, . . . , Vr) with |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n, where the r-cliques
have been given a uniform weight which we wish to correct to a fractional Kr-
decomposition.

3. Numbers of cliques

We will ﬁrst prove some simple results concerning the number of cliques in our r-
partite graph G. We wish to consider the number of cliques with vertices in speciﬁed
classes, and therefore make the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Given an r-partite graph G on (V1, . . . , Vr) and a set I ⊆ [r], let
KI (G) be the set of |I|-cliques in G with one vertex in Vi for each i ∈ I. Where G
is the only graph under consideration, let KI = KI (G). Let kI = kI (G) = |KI (G)|.

In graphs with a high minimum degree, we can show that for each I ⊆ [r] and

i ∈ I, the quantities kI and kI\{i} are closely related.
Proposition 3.2. Let r ≥ 3 and n ∈ N, 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1/2r, and let G be an r-partite
graph on (V1, . . . , Vr), where |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − δ)n. Then, for
each I ⊆ [r] and i ∈ I,

kI /n ≤ kI\{i} ≤ (1 + 2δr)kI /n.

Proof. For each clique K ∈ KI\{i}, using the minimum degree of G, the number of
cliques in KI containing K is at least n − |I \ {i}| · δn ≥ (1 − δr)n, and at most n.
Each clique K ∈ KI contains exactly one clique in KI\{i}. Therefore,

kI /n ≤ kI\{i} ≤ kI /(1 − δr)n ≤ (1 + 2δr)kI /n,

where the last inequality follows as δr ≤ 1/2.

(cid:3)

We will now show that each edge in our graph is in approximately the same number
of r-cliques. This will imply that the initial weighting of the r-cliques is close to a
fractional Kr-decomposition.

Lemma 3.3. Let r ≥ 3 and n ∈ N, 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1/8r, and let G be an r-partite graph on
(V1, . . . , Vr), where |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − δ)n. For each e ∈ E(G),
let ze be the number of r-cliques in G containing e. Then, for each e ∈ E(G), we
have

≤ 9δrk[r]/n2.

(3.1)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ze − k[r]/n2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

By Lemma 3.2, |k[r]\{i,j} − k[r]/n2| ≤ ((1 + 2δr)2 − 1)k[r]/n2 ≤ 5δrk[r]/n2, which,
(cid:3)

together with (3.2), implies (3.1).

Proof. Let i, j ∈ I and e = xy ∈ E(G) with x ∈ Vi and y ∈ Vj and note that zxy is
equal to the number of cliques in K[r]\{i,j} which lie in N (x) ∩ N (y). If k ∈ [r] \ {i, j}
and z ∈ Vk, then the number of cliques in K[r]\{i,j} which contain z is at most

k[r]\{i,j,k} ≤ (1 + 2δr)3k[r]/n3 ≤ (5/4)3k[r]/n3 ≤ 2k[r]/n3,

where we have used Proposition 3.2. Therefore,

|(N c(x) ∪ N c(y)) ∩ Vk| · 2k[r]/n3 ≤ 4δrk[r]/n2.

(3.2)

|zxy − k[r]\{i,j}| ≤ Xk∈[r]\{i,j}

4. Gadgets

In this section, we will construct certain functions, called gadgets, which alter
the weight on edges in our graph by altering the weight of the r-cliques. We will
use gadgets which do not alter the total weight on the edges, for which we use the
following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 4.1. Given any set A, a function f : A → R is a zero-sum function if

Pa∈A f (a) = 0.

Our ﬁrst gadget works with the edges between two distinct vertices v and v′ in
some class Vi and some vertices uj ∈ Vj ∩ N (v)∩ N (v′), j ∈ [r]\{i}. Adding weight 1
to (the weight on) each edge vuj, the gadget removes weight 1 from each edge v′uj
(as depicted in Figure 1). If uj1uj2 was an edge for each distinct j1 and j2 in [r] \ {i},
then we could easily create such a gadget.
Indeed, adding weight 1 to the clique
with vertex set {v, uj : j ∈ [r] \ {i}}, and removing weight 1 from the clique with
vertex set {v′, uj : j ∈ [r] \ {i}} eﬀects this change, as the change in the weight on
each edge uj1uj2 is cancelled out. Let us call such a gadget a simple gadget.

Typically, we will not have all such edges uj1uj2 in our graph. Instead, we will
ﬁnd a set of new vertices A = {aj : j ∈ [r] \ {i}} where each vertex aj is a neighbour
of every other vertex uj ′, aj ′, v and v′ except for uj. For each j ∈ [r] \ {i}, let
Aj = A \ {aj}. For each j ∈ [r] \ {i}, as G[{v, uj } ∪ Aj] and G[{v′, uj} ∪ Aj] are
cliques, we can use a simple gadget to increase the weight on each edge between v
and Aj ∪ {uj} by 1 and decrease the weight on each edge between v′ and Aj ∪ {uj}
by 1. In total, this increases the weight on each edge between v and {uj : j ∈ [r]\{i}}
by 1 and decreases the weight on each edge between v′ and {uj : j ∈ [r] \ {i}} by 1,
as required, but it also increases the weight on each edge between v and A by r − 2
and decreases the weight on each edge between v′ and A by r − 2. However, as
G[{v} ∪ A] and G[{v′} ∪ A] are both cliques we can reverse this last change using a
simple gadget.

This describes the underlying method of our gadget, but changes the weight of a
few cliques by a large amount, while we wish only to make a small adjustment to the
weight of any clique. To avoid this, we will take an average of the above construction
for our ﬁrst gadget over all possible such vertex sets A.

Lemma 4.2. Let r ≥ 3 and n ≥ 8r2. Let G be an r-partite graph on (V1, . . . , Vr),
where |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/8r2)n. Let j ∈ [r], let v, v′ ∈ Vj with
v 6= v′ and, for each i ∈ [r] \ {j}, let ui ∈ Vi ∩ N (v) ∩ N (v′).

Then, there is a zero-sum function ψ : K[r] → R so that the following hold.

(i) For each e ∈ E(G),

XK∈K[r]:e∈E(K)

ψ(K) =


if e = vui for some i ∈ [r] \ {j}

otherwise.

2n2/k[r]
2rn/k[r]
0

if |V (K) ∩ V | = 1 and |V (K) ∩ {v, v′}| = 1
if |V (K) ∩ V | = 0 and |V (K) ∩ {v, v′}| = 1
otherwise.

Proof. Suppose, without loss of generality, that j = r, and let V = {u1, . . . , ur−1}.
Let H be the set of sets A = {a1, . . . , ar−1} with ai ∈ Vi, ai ∈ ∩i′∈[r−1]\{i}N (ui′),
and ai ∈ N (v) ∩ N (v′), for each i ∈ [r − 1], and G[A] ∈ K[r−1].

For each K ∈ K[r−1], V (K) /∈ H if and only if V (K) intersects with N c(ui) \ Vi,
for some i ∈ [r − 1], or N c(v) \ Vr, or N c(v′) \ Vr. For each j ∈ [r − 1] and z ∈ Vj,
there are at most k[r−1]\{j} ≤ 2k[r−1]/n cliques K ∈ K[r−1] containing z, where we
have used Proposition 3.2. As ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/8r2)n, for each j ∈ [r] and z ∈ Vj we
have |N c(z) \ Vj| ≤ (r − 1)n/8r2, and hence

|H| ≥ k[r−1] − |(∪i∈[r−1]N c(ui) \ Vi) ∪ (N c(v) \ Vr) ∪ (N c(v′) \ Vr)| · 2k[r−1]/n

≥ k[r−1] − (r + 1) · (r − 1)n/8r2 · 2k[r−1]/n ≥ k[r−1]/2 ≥ k[r]/2n,

(4.1)

where we have used Proposition 3.2.

For each clique K ∈ K[r], let αK be the number of sets A ∈ H for which K ⊆

and let ψ(K) = αKφ(K)/|H|. Note that for each clique K ∈ K[r] we cannot have
both v ∈ V (K) and v′ ∈ V (K), and therefore φ is well-deﬁned. We will show that ψ
satisﬁes the requirements of the lemma.

Firstly, let A ∈ H. For each clique K ∈ K[r] with K ⊆ G[A ∪ V ∪ {v}] and
v ∈ V (K), if we switch v for v′ then we alter only the sign of φ(K). That is,
φ(G[(V (K) \ {v}) ∪ {v′}]) = −φ(K). Thus, as φ(K) = 0 if V (K) ∩ {v, v′} = ∅, if
e ∈ E(G) with V (e) ∩ {v, v′} = ∅, then

If e = vui with i ∈ [r − 1], then the only K ∈ K[r] with K ⊆ G[A ∪ V ∪ {v, v′}],
e ∈ E(K) and φ(K) 6= 0 is G[(A \ {ai}) ∪ V (e)]. Therefore,

K⊆G[A∪V ∪{v,v′}]:e∈E(K)

φ(K) = 1.

Similarly, if e = v′ui with i ∈ [r − 1], then PK⊆G[A∪V ∪{v,v′}]:e∈E(K) φ(K) = −1.

If e = vai with i ∈ [r − 1], then the only K ∈ K[r] with K ⊆ G[A ∪ V ∪ {v, v′}],
e ∈ E(K) and φ(K) 6= 0 are G[A ∪ {v}] and the cliques G[(A \ {ai′}) ∪ {ui′, v}] with
i′ ∈ [r − 1] \ {i}, so that

K⊆G[A∪V ∪{v,v′}]:e∈E(K)

φ(K) = −(r − 2) + (r − 2) · 1 = 0.

Similarly, if e = v′ai with i ∈ [r − 1] then PK⊆G[A∪V ∪{v,v′}]:e∈E(K) φ(K) = 0. If

e ∈ E(G) with V (e) 6⊆ A ∪ V ∪ {v, v′} then there are no cliques K ∈ K[r] with

otherwise.

If K ∈ K[r], |V (K) ∩ V | = 1 and |V (K) ∩ {v, v′}| = 1, then for each set A ∈ H with
V (K) ⊆ A∪V ∪{v, v′} we have V (K)\(V ∪{v, v′}) ⊆ A, |V (K)\(V ∪{v, v′})| = r−2
and G[A] ∈ K[r−1]; thus αK ≤ n. If K ∈ K[r], |V (K) ∩ V | = 0 and |V (K) ∩ {v, v′}| =
1, then there is at most one set A ∈ H with V (K) ⊆ A ∪ V ∪ {v, v′}, namely
A = V (K) \ {v, v′} if A ⊆ ∩i∈[r−1](N (ui) ∪ Vi) and A ⊆ N (v) ∩ N (v′); thus αK ≤ 1.
Together with (4.4), (4.1) and the deﬁnition of ψ, this gives (ii).

Our second gadget works with distinct vertices v and v′ in some class Vi and
distinct vertices u1 and u2 in some other class Vj which are neighbours of both v
and v′. The gadget removes weight 1 from vu2 and v′u1 and adds weight 1 to vu1
and v′u2 (see Figure 2). Simpler than the construction for the ﬁrst gadget, for the
construction of the second gadget we ﬁrst ﬁnd a vertex set A = {ai′ ∈ Vi : i′ ∈
[r] \ {i, j}} of neighbours of v, v′, u1 and u2, so that G[A] is a clique. Adding
weight 1 to the cliques G[{v, u1} ∪ A] and G[{v′, u2} ∪ A] and removing weight 1
from the cliques G[{v, u2} ∪ A] and G[{v′, u1} ∪ A] produces the required change.
Similarly as in our construction of the ﬁrst gadget, we wish to avoid making large
adjustments to the weight of any clique. Therefore, we will take our second gadget to
be the average of this construction over all the diﬀerent possible such vertex sets A.

Lemma 4.3. Let r ≥ 3 and n ≥ 16r. Let G be an r-partite graph on (V1, . . . , Vr),
where |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/16r)n. Let i, j ∈ [r] and let v, v′ ∈ Vi
and u1, u2 ∈ Vj be distinct vertices with vu1, vu2, v′u1, v′u2 ∈ E(G).

Then, there is a zero-sum function ψ : K[r] → R so that the following hold.

|ψ(K)| ≤(cid:26) 2n2/k[r]

if |V (K) ∩ V | = 2
otherwise.

Proof. Suppose, without loss of generality, that i = r − 1 and j = r, and let V =
{v, v′, u1, u2}. Let H be the set of sets A = {a1, . . . , ar−2} with ai ∈ Vi and ai ∈
N (v) ∩ N (v′) ∩ N (u1) ∩ N (u2), for each i ∈ [r − 2], and G[A] ∈ K[r−2].

For each K ∈ K[r−2], V (K) /∈ H if and only if V (K) intersects with N c(v)∪N c(v′)∪
N c(u1) ∪ N c(u2). For each j ∈ [r − 2] and z ∈ Vj, there are at most k[r−2]\{j} ≤
2k[r−2]/n cliques K ∈ K[r−2] containing z, where we have used Proposition 3.2.
Therefore, as ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/16r)n,

|H| ≥ k[r−2] − |(N c(v) ∪ N c(v′) ∪ N c(u1) ∪ N c(u2)) \ (Vj−1 ∪ Vj)| · 2k[r−2]/n

≥ k[r−2] − 4r · n/16r · 2k[r−2]/n = k[r−2]/2 ≥ k[r]/2n2,

(4.5)

where we have again used Proposition 3.2.

For each K ∈ K[r], let αK be the number of sets A ∈ H for which K ⊆ G[A ∪ V ],

let

and let ψ(K) = αKφ(K)/|H|. We will show that ψ satisﬁes the requirements of the
lemma.

Firstly, let A ∈ H and e ∈ E(G) with V (e) ⊆ A ∪ V . There are 4 cliques K ∈ K[r]
for which φ(K) 6= 0 and K ⊆ G[A ∪ V ], namely G[A ∪ {v, u1}], G[A ∪ {v, u2}],
G[A ∪ {v′, u1}] and G[A ∪ {v′, u2}].

If V (e) ⊆ A, then e is contained in each of these cliques, and hence we have that

of these cliques – the two cliques containing the single vertex in V (e) ∩ V – and in

PK⊆G[A∪V ]:e∈E(K) φ(K) = 0. If |V (e) ∩ V | = 1, then e is contained in exactly two
each possibility we can see that PK⊆G[A∪V ]:e∈E(K) φ(K) = 0. If V (e) 6⊆ A ∪ V then

none of these cliques contain e. If V (e) ⊆ V , then e is contained in only one of these
cliques and checking the possibilities we can see that

XK⊆G[A∪V ]:e∈E(K)

φ(K) = 1{e∈{vu1,v′u2}} − 1{e∈{vu2,v′u1}},

ψ(K) = Xe∈E(G) XK∈K[r]:e∈E(K)

and thus ψ is a zero-sum function.

Secondly, for each K ∈ K[r], (4.6) implies that |φ(K)| = 1{|V (K)∩V |=2}. If K ∈ K[r]
and |V (K) ∩ V | = 2, then there is at most one set A ∈ H with K ⊆ A ∪ V , namely
V (K) \ V if V (K) \ V ⊆ ∩u∈V N (u); thus αK ≤ 1. Therefore, as |H| ≥ k[r]/2n2
by (4.5), if |V (K) ∩ V | = 2 then ψ(K) ≤ 2n2/k[r]. As for each K ∈ K[r] with
|V (K) ∩ V | 6= 2 we have ψ(K) = 0, this gives (ii).

Finally in this section, given a set of required corrections to the weights of edges
around a vertex v (where the total corrections to the weights on the edges from v
into any class is the same, as will naturally occur in our setup) we will break down
these corrections into a set A of corrections we can make using the ﬁrst type of
gadget and a set B of corrections we can make using the second type of gadget.

Lemma 4.4. Let r ≥ 3 and n ∈ N. Let G be an r-partite graph on (V1, . . . , Vr),
where |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n. Let j ∈ [r], v ∈ Vj and z ∈ R. Let zvu ∈ R for each
u ∈ N (v), and suppose that for each i ∈ [r] \ {j} we have

zvu = z.

Xu∈Vi∩N (v)

Let V be the set of sets V ⊆ N (v) with |V ∩ Vi| = 1 for each i ∈ [r] \ {j}. Then,
there are sets A ⊆ {(A, a) : A ∈ V, a ∈ R} and B ⊆ {(u1, u2, b) : u1, u2 ∈ Vi ∩
N (v) for some i ∈ [r] \ {j}, b > 0} so that the following hold.

(i) For each (A, a) ∈ A and u ∈ A, sgn(zvu) = sgn(a).
(ii) For each (u1, u2, b) ∈ B, zvu1 > 0 and zvu2 < 0.
(iii) For each u ∈ N (v),

zvu = X(A,a)∈A

a · 1{u∈A} + X(u1,u2,b)∈B

b · (1{u=u1} − 1{u=u2}).

Proof. Suppose without loss of generality that j = r. We will prove the lemma by
induction on the number of weights zvu, u ∈ N (v), which are non-zero. If all the
weights are non-zero then we simply take A = ∅ and B = ∅.

Let us suppose then that there is some i ∈ [r − 1] and ui ∈ Vi ∩ N (v) with zvui 6= 0,
and furthermore select such an i and ui so that |zvui| is minimised. Assume that
zvui > 0, where the case where zvui < 0 follows similarly.

If there is some u′

i ∈ Vi ∩ N (v) with zvu′

i

< 0, then let b = zvui . For each u ∈ N (v),

Therefore, we may assume that there is no u′

thus z = Pu∈Vi∩N (v) zvu ≥ zvui > 0. Therefore, for each j ∈ [r − 1] \ {i}, as
Pu∈Vj∩N (v) zvu = z > 0, we can ﬁnd a vertex uj ∈ Vj ∩ N (v) with zvuj > 0. Let

a = zvui. For each u ∈ N (v), let

As z′

vu, and thus by the induction hypothesis there exist
sets A′ ⊆ {(A, a) : A ∈ V, a ∈ R} and B′ ⊆ {(u′

[r − 1], b ∈ R} for which (i)–(iii) hold with the weights z′

choice of i and ui, sgn(zvu) = sgn(z′
vu) for each u ∈ N (v). Let A = A′ ∪ {({uj :

completes the inductive step, and hence the proof of the lemma.

5. Moving weight onto a clique

Having constructed our gadgets in the previous section, we will now use them to
move weight around the graph. Given corrections we wish to make to the weight
on the edges around a vertex v in the graph, we will use the gadgets to make these
corrections, while necessarily making changes to the weight on other edges. By
ensuring that the vertices which take the role of v′ in our gadgets lie in some ﬁxed
subset V , we will be able to make all the required corrections to the weight on edges
in the graph, except for edges with at least one endvertex in V . We will ﬁrst give a
deﬁnition which will allow us to specify sets V into which we can move weight in this
manner, before using our gadgets to make corrections to the weight on edges next
to a vertex v at the expense of alterations made to the weight on edges adjacent to
vertices in the same class as v and in V , proving Lemma 5.2.

Deﬁnition 5.1. Let r ≥ 3, let G be an r-partite graph on (V1, . . . , Vr), and let
j ∈ [r]. We say a set V ⊆ Vj is j-neighbour-rich if for each subset W ⊆ V (G) \ Vj
with |W | ≤ r we have |V ∩ (∩u∈W N (u))| ≥ |V |/2.

Proof. Suppose without loss of generality that j = r. Let V be the set of sets
A ⊆ N (v) with |A ∩ Vi| = 1 for each i ∈ [r − 1]. By Lemma 4.4, we may take sets
A ⊆ {(A, a) : A ∈ V, a ∈ R} and B ⊆ {(u1, u2, b) : u1, u2 ∈ Vi ∩ N (v) for some i ∈
[r − 1], b > 0} which satisfy the following.

B1 For each (A, a) ∈ A and u ∈ A, sgn(zvu) = sgn(a).

For each (A, a) ∈ A, and each vertex v′ ∈ V ∩ (Tu∈A N (u)) ⊆ Vr, by Lemma 4.2 we

may let ψA,v′ : K[r] → R be a zero-sum function satisfying the following.

|ψu1,u2,v′(K)| ≤ 2n2/k[r] · 1{|V (K)∩{v,v′,u1,u2}|=2}.

To prove that A2 holds, let e ∈ E(G) with V (e)∩(V ∪{v}) = ∅ or V (e)∩N (v) = ∅.

we have PK∈K[r]:vu∈E(K) ψ(K) = zvu, and thus A1 holds.
For each (A, a) ∈ A and v′ ∈ V ∩ (Tu∈A N (u)), as A ⊆ N (v) we either have that
V (e) ∩ {v, v′} = ∅ or V (e) ∩ A = ∅. Therefore, by C1, PK∈K[r]:e∈E(K) ψA,v′(K) = 0.

Similarly, for each (u1, u2, b) ∈ B and v′ ∈ V ∩ N (u1) ∩ N (u2) we have either V (e) ∩

{v, v′} = ∅ or V (e)∩{u1, u2} = ∅, and thus by D1 thatPK∈K[r]:e∈E(K) ψu1,u2,v′(K) =
0. Therefore, by (5.2), (5.3) and as ψ = ψ1 + ψ2, we have PK∈K[r]:e∈E(K) ψ(K) = 0,
(A, a) ∈ A and v′ ∈ V ∩ (Tz∈A N (z)), as u 6= v and u /∈ A, we have by C1 that

To prove that A3 holds, let uw ∈ E(G) with u ∈ V and w ∈ N (v). For each

and for each (u1, u2, b) ∈ B and v′ ∈ V ∩ N (u1) ∩ N (u2), we have by D1 that

and thus A3 holds.

We will now prove A4. First note that if K ∈ K[r], v /∈ V (K) and V (K) ∩ V = ∅,
then by C2, D2, (5.2), and (5.3), and as ψ = ψ1 + ψ2, we have ψ(K) = 0. This
leaves us with two cases to consider with K ∈ K[r], that is, when V (K) ∩ V 6= ∅ and
when v ∈ V (K). Note that, as V and {v} are disjoint subsets of Vr, these cases do
not intersect, and in the former case |V (K) ∩ V | = 1.

and thus A4 also holds in the case where v ∈ V (K), completing the proof of A4. (cid:3)

Lemma 5.2 allows us to make corrections to the weights on edges incident to a
vertex v, at the expense of changes to the weights on edges adjacent to vertices in a
set V which are in the same class as V . We will take a large set V for which V ∩ Vj
is j-neighbour-rich for each j ∈ [r], and for each vertex outside V , lying say in Vi, we
will use Lemma 5.2 with V ∩ Vi. This will allow us to make the correct adjustments
to every edge which has no endvertex in V . Repeating a similar movement, we can
then make the corrections to the weights on edges with exactly one endvertex in V .
This will complete the required corrections to the weight on the edges not contained
within the set V , giving us the following lemma.

Lemma 5.3. Let r ≥ 3 and n ≥ 8r2. Let G be an r-partite graph on (V1, . . . , Vr),
where |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/8r2)n. Let zv ∈ R for each v ∈ V (G)

Let V ⊆ V (G) be a set such that, for each j ∈ [r], V ∩ Vj is j-neighbour-rich and
|V ∩ Vj| = |V |/r.

Then, there is a zero-sum function ψ : K[r] → R such that the following hold.

E1 For each e ∈ E(G) with V (e) 6⊆ V , we have PK∈K[r]:e∈E(K) ψ(K) = ze.

Proof of Claim 5.4. If u, v /∈ V , then for each w ∈ V (G) \ (V ∪ {u, v}) we have that

{u, v} ∩ (Vw ∪ {w}) = ∅ and so, by F2, PK∈K[r]:uv∈E(K) ψw(K) = 0. By F1, we

we have |PK∈K[r]:uv∈E(K) ψw(K)| ≤ 2r/|V |. By F1, PK∈K[r]:uv∈E(K) ψv(K) = zuv

and therefore, by (5.16),

|z′

Similarly, if u /∈ V and v ∈ V , then |z′

we have either u ∈ Vw and v ∈ N (w) or u ∈ Vw and v ∈ N (w). In each case we

If u, v ∈ V , then by F2, for each w ∈ V (G) \ V with PK∈K[r]:uv∈E(K) ψw(K) 6= 0,
must have w ∈ Vj(u) ∪ Vj(v) and, by F3, |PK∈K[r]:uv∈E(K) ψw(K)| ≤ 2r/|V |. Thus,

w(K) = 0. For each w ∈ (Vj(v) \ V ) ∩ N (u),
w(K) = 0. Therefore, if u /∈ V

Given a clique K in the graph G, our aim is make all the corrections to the weight
on the edges outside K, where if the sum of the corrections to made is 0 then these
corrections will naturally cancel out inside K as well. We cannot use Lemma 5.3 to
do this directly, as typically V (K) ∩ Vj will be not j-neighbour-rich for each j ∈ [r].
Indeed, this is equivalent to each vertex in K being a neighbour of every vertex
in the other classes. Instead, we will use an intermediate set V whose vertices are
neighbours of each vertex in V (K) except for the vertex in the same class. The set V
will be large, so that the minimum degree condition for G will imply that V ∩ Vj is
j-neighbour-rich for each j ∈ [r]. We can then move the corrections needed onto the
edges within V . Then, as V (K)∩ Vj will be j-neighbour-rich in G[V ] for each j ∈ [r],
we can move the corrections into the set V (K), to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 5.6. Let r ≥ 3 and n ≥ 16r2. Let G be an r-partite graph on (V1, . . . , Vr),
where |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/16r2)n. For each v ∈ V (G), let
zv ∈ R, and for each e ∈ E(G), let ze ∈ [−1, 1]. Suppose that for each j ∈ [r],
i ∈ [r] \ {j} and v ∈ Vj we have

zuv = zv.

Take a new graph G′ = G[V ], and note that if K ′ ∈ K[r](G) \ K[r](G′), then K ′
contains a vertex in V (G) \ V . Therefore, if for each v ∈ V (G) j(v) is such that
v ∈ Vj(v), then

|K[r](G) \ K[r](G′)| ≤ Xv∈V (G)\V

k[r]\{j(v)}(G) ≤ (rn − |V |) · 2k[r](G)/n ≤ k[r](G)/2,

where we have used Proposition 3.2 and the fact that |V | = rn(1 − 1/8r). Thus,
k[r](G′) ≥ k[r](G)/2.

For each v ∈ V (G) and i ∈ [r] \ {j(v)} we have, as z′

so we may use Lemma 5.3 with the weights z′

For each j ∈ [r] and v ∈ V \ Vj, we have by the choice of V that v ∈ N (vj).
Therefore, as V (G′) = V , {vj} is j-neighbour-rich in G′ for each j ∈ [r]. Thus, by
Lemma 5.3 with the set V (K) and the weights z′

Thus, if we set φ(K ′) = ψ(K ′) + ψ′(K ′) for each K ′ ∈ K[r], then H1 holds.

To show ψ satisﬁes our requirements, it is left to show that H2 holds. Let K ′ ∈ K[r]
and recall that n ≥ 16r2. If V (K ′) ∩ V (K) = ∅, then by I3 and J2 we have |φ(K)| ≤
103n2r2/k[r]. If |V (K ′) ∩ V (K)| = 1, then by I3 and J2 we have |φ(K)| ≤ (2550 +
135r/n)n3r/k[r] ≤ 104n3r/k[r]. If |V (K ′) ∩ V (K)| ≥ 2, then by I3 and J2 we have
|φ(K)| ≤ (2250 + 135r2/n2)n4|V (K ′) ∩ V (K)|2/k[r] ≤ 2500n4|V (K ′) ∩ V (K)|2/k[r].
(cid:3)

Finally, we can now prove Theorem 1.1 by applying Lemma 5.6 with each of the
diﬀerent r-cliques K in the graph and taking an average of the resulting gadgets.
This averaging ensures that the weight of any clique is not adjusted by a large
amount.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let r ≥ 3 and n ∈ N. Let G be an r-partite graph on
(V1, . . . , Vr), where |V1| = . . . = |Vr| = n and ˆδ(G) ≥ (1 − 1/106r3)n. Note that
if n < 106r3, then ˆδ(G) = n, so G is a complete r-partite graph and hence trivially
has a fractional Kr-decomposition. Suppose then that n ≥ 106r3.

For each e ∈ E(G), let ze be the number of r-cliques in G containing e, so that
ze = |{K ∈ K[r] : e ∈ E(K)}|. By Lemma 3.3, |zen2/k[r] − 1| ≤ 9/106r2 for each

e ∈ E(G). Due to the minimum degree of G, n2(cid:0)r
and thus |zee(G)/(cid:0)r

2(cid:1)k[r] − 1| ≤ 1/105r2.

i ∈ [r] and v ∈ V (G) \ Vi,

2(cid:1) ≥ e(G) ≥ n2(cid:0)r

2(cid:1)(1 − 1/106r3),

For each v ∈ V (G), let zv be the number of cliques containing v. Then, for each

Xu∈N (v)∩Vi(cid:16)zuve(G)/(cid:18)r

2(cid:19)k[r] − 1(cid:17) = zve(G)/(cid:18)r

2(cid:19)k[r] − d(v, Vi),

and thus for each distinct i, j ∈ [r]

Xv∈Vj Xu∈N (v)∩Vi(cid:16)zuve(G)/(cid:18)r
= k[r]e(G)/(cid:18)r

2(cid:19)k[r] − 1(cid:17) = Xv∈Vj(cid:16)zve(G)/(cid:18)r
2(cid:19)k[r] − Xv∈Vj
d(v, Vi) = e(G)/(cid:18)r

2(cid:19)k[r] − d(v, Vi)(cid:17)
2(cid:19) − d(Vj, Vi),

(5.29)

(5.30)

where d(Vj , Vi) is the number of edges between Vj and Vi. Now, for each k ∈ [r]\{i, j},
as G is Kr-divisible we have

d(Vi, Vk) = Xv∈Vi

d(v, Vk) = Xv∈Vi

d(v, Vj ) = d(Vi, Vj).

Therefore there is the same number of edges between any two classes, that is, for

each distinct i, j ∈ [r] we have e(G) = (cid:0)r
2(cid:1)k[r] − 1) = 0.

That is, for each K ∈ K[r], there is some function ψK : K[r] → R such that for each

if |V (K ′) ∩ V (K)| = 1
if |V (K ′) ∩ V (K)| = 2
if 3 ≤ |V (K ′) ∩ V (K)| ≤ r.

(5.31)

|V (K ′) ∩ V (K)| = 2, where we have used Proposition 3.2. Similarly, there are at

with |V (K ′) ∩ V (K)| = 1, where we have used Proposition 3.2. Furthermore, there

For each K ′ ∈ K[r], there are at most Pi∈[r] k[r]\{i} ≤ 2rk[r]/n cliques K ∈ K[r]
are at most Pi,j∈[r]:i6=j k[r]\{i,j} ≤ (cid:0)r

3(cid:1)23k[r]/n3 ≤ 2r3k[r]/n3 cliques K ∈ K[r] with |V (K ′) ∩ V (K)| ≥ 3.

Thus, combining these calculations with (5.31), we have for each K ′ ∈ K[r] that

|ψK(K ′)| ≤ n2/102k[r] · k[r] + n3/10rk[r] · 2rk[r]/n

2(cid:19),

where we have used that n ≥ 106r3. Therefore, if for each K ′ ∈ K[r] we let wK ′ =
ψK (K ′))/k[r], then wK ′ ≥ 0. Furthermore, for each e ∈ E(G),

(e(G)/(cid:0)r

Thus, the weights wK ′, K ′ ∈ K[r], form a fractional Kr-decomposition of G.

6. Limitations of our method and possible improvements

The methods used here to prove Theorem 1.1 are comparable to those used by
Barber, K¨uhn, Lo, Osthus and the author [1] to ﬁnd a fractional Kr-decomposition
in non-partite graphs with a high minimum degree (where the implementation is
much simpler). In [1] these techniques were then developed to reduce the required
minimum degree. In this section, we will discuss the limitations of the techniques
used in this paper, and the possibility of implementing some of the improvements
from [1].

Let us suppose we have a Kr-divisible r-partite graph G with n vertices in each
class and ˆδ(G) = (1 − δ)n, for some δ = δ(r). By initially weighting each r-clique
uniformly so that the weight on the individual edges is on average 1, we ensure that
the weight on each edge is within the interval (1 − 9δr, 1 + 9δr) (as follows from

FRACTIONAL CLIQUE DECOMPOSITIONS OF DENSE PARTITE GRAPHS

27

Lemma 3.3). This means that by moving a proportion at most 9δr of the weight on
the edges around we can gain a fractional Kr-decomposition. However, our gadgets
with which we move the weight around are not very eﬃcient. Most of the change
caused by altering the weight of an r-clique is cancelled out by altering the weight of
other r-cliques, leaving changes to the weight on only a small number of altered edges.
Examining the gadgets, we see that we only alter the weight of cliques containing

at most one altered edge. This means that all but at most a proportion 1/(cid:0)r

the changes made by altering the individual weight of an r-clique are cancelled out
by other changes. Due to this ineﬃciency, we can (only) use the gadgets to move a
proportion Θ(1/r2) of the weight on the edges. By taking δ = ε/r3, for some small
constant ε > 0, we can successfully move up to a proportion 9δr = Θ(1/r2) of the
weight on the edges around, and thus can correct the initial weighting to gain a
fractional Kr-decomposition, proving Theorem 1.1.

2(cid:1) of

In order to reduce the minimum degree required by these methods we could either
ﬁnd a way to reduce the corrections we need to make to the initial weighting or ﬁnd
a more eﬃcient way to make those corrections. In the non-partite setting the compa-
rable initial method would show that an n-vertex graph G with δ(G) ≥ (1 − ε/r3)n
must have a fractional Kr-decomposition, for some small constant ε = ε(r) > 0.
In [1], the authors reduced the corrections needed to the initial weighting by itera-
tively removing copies of Kr from G until this could not be done without breaching
the minimum degree condition. They also moved the weight more eﬃciently around
the graph by simultaneously altering the weight on every edge incident to a ﬁxed
vertex. In combination, this reduced the minimum degree bound required by the
methods to δ(G) ≥ (1 − ε/r3/2)n.

It seems likely that in the partite setting we can similarly reduce the amount
of weight we need to move around the graph after the initial weighting, and thus
reduce the bound required in Theorem 1.1 to ˆδ(G) ≥ (1−ε/r2)n (some further details
are given below). In the partite setting, the technicalities involved in attempting to
adapt the second round of improvements from [1] in order to move the weight around
more eﬃciently are signiﬁcant, but it is plausible further progress can be made in
this manner. However, even if this is possible it seems very unlikely the minimum
degree bound in Theorem 1.1 could be reduced to give the correct dependence on r
using such techniques, let alone that Conjecture 1.3 could be proved.

We will conclude by sketching how the amount of weight that is needed to be
moved from the initial weighting could be reduced, where the (substantial) remaining
details can be inferred from [1]. Starting with a Kr-divisible r-partite graph G
satisfying ˆδ(G) ≥ (1−δ)n, with δ = ε/r2 for some small constant ε > 0, we iteratively
remove copies of Kr from G until no further copies can be removed without violating
the minimum degree condition. For each i ∈ [r], let Xi ⊆ Vi be the set of vertices v
for which d(v, Vj ) ≥ (1 − δ)n + 1 for each j ∈ [r] \ {i}. We must have mini |Xi| ≤ δrn,
for otherwise (as follows from the minimum degree condition) there would be a copy
of Kr with a vertex each in the sets Xi, i ∈ [r], which we could remove without
breaking the minimum degree condition, a contradiction. Letting j ∈ [r] be such
that |Xj| ≤ δrn, for each i ∈ [r] \ {j} we have

|d(v, Vi) − (1 − δ)n| ≤ |Xj|δn + n ≤ 2δ2rn2.

RICHARD MONTGOMERY

As the graph G is Kr-divisible, there is the same number of edges between any two
diﬀerent vertex classes. Due to the minimum degree condition this must be at least
(1 − δ)n2 edges and from (6.1) it is at most (1 − δ)n2 + 2δ2rn2 edges. The number
of r-cliques containing an edge xy ∈ E(G) with x ∈ Vi and y ∈ Vj is related to
|(N c(x) ∪ N c(y)) \ (Vi ∪ Vj)| (this could be shown using methods in the proof of
Lemma 3.3 with adaptations similar to those found in [1]), and
|(N c(x) ∪ N c(y)) \ (Vi ∪ Vj)|

= 2(r − 2)n − (r − 2)(d(x) + d(y))/(r − 1) + |(N c(x) ∩ N c(y)) \ (Vi ∪ Vj)|.
As G is close to a complete r-partite graph, the average of |(N c(x)∩N c(y))\(Vi ∪Vj)|
over all edges xy is small, and on average the degree of x and y does not deviate
far from (1 − δ)n. This limits the average deviation of |(N c(x) ∪ N c(y)) \ (Vi ∪ Vj)|
from its typical value, and could be used to show that on average the corrections to
be made to the initial weight on each edge is O(δ2r2), while the maximum change
required to the weight on any edge remains O(δr) (as follows from Lemma 3.3).

As δ = ε/r2, for suﬃciently small ε > 0 this average change is less than the change
that can be made using the gadgets, which was Θ(1/r2). However, potentially the
required correction to the weight on some edges may be well above average (yet still,
as noted, O(δr)). If an r-clique contains too many of these edges then this method
may change the weight of the clique too much, risking the weight of that clique
becoming negative. To avoid this, we could use gadgets in our initial constructions
in Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 which only alter the weight of those cliques in which the
weight on their edges do not on average need large adjustments (similarly to the
methods used in [1]).
