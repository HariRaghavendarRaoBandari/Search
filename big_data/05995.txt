Abstract

For K ⊆ Rn a compact convex subset with non-empty interior, let
Diﬀ ∂K (K) be the group of all C ∞-diﬀeomorphisms of K which ﬁx
∂K pointwise. We show that Diﬀ ∂K(K) is a C 0-regular inﬁnite-
dimensional Lie group. As a byproduct, we obtain results concerning
solutions to ordinary diﬀerential equations on compact convex sets.

Introduction and statement of the main results

Lie groups of smooth diﬀeomorphisms of compact manifolds (like the diﬀeo-
morphism group Diﬀ(S1) of the circle) are among the most prominent and
important examples of inﬁnite-dimensional Lie groups (see, e.g., [16], [18],
[20], [22], [26]; cf. [27]). A Lie group structure on Diﬀ(K) even is available
if K is a compact manifold with boundary or corners [21]; this includes the
case that K ⊆ Rn is a convex polyhedron.1 In this article, we describe Lie
groups of diﬀeomorphisms of an arbitrary compact convex subset K ⊆ Rn
with non-empty interior (whose boundary ∂K need not satisfy any regularity
assumptions). To explain the result, let us call a map γ : K → Rn smooth
if it is continuous, its restriction γ|K 0 to the interior of K is smooth, and
all iterated directional derivatives on K 0 admit continuous extensions to all
of K (see 1.3 for details). We write Diﬀ(K) for the group of all smooth
diﬀeomorphisms of K, i.e., bijections φ : K → K such that both φ and φ−1

1Diﬀeomorphism groups of non-compact manifolds can also be treated; their Lie group
structures are modelled only on Lie algebras of compactly supported smooth vector ﬁelds.
For Lie groups of real analytic diﬀeomorphisms of real analytic, compact manifolds with
or without boundary or corners, cf. [6], [7], and [18].

are smooth in the preceding sense. We endow the space C ∞(K, Rn) of all
smooth Rn-valued mappings on K with the smooth compact-open topology
(as recalled in 1.4), which makes it a Fr´echet space (see [15], cf. [2]). Then
also the closed vector subspace

C ∞

∂K(K, Rn) := {η ∈ C ∞(K, Rn) : η|∂K = 0}

of C ∞(K, Rn) is a Fr´echet space. Now

Diﬀ∂K(K) := {φ ∈ Diﬀ(K) : (∀x ∈ ∂K) : φ(x) = x}

is a subgroup of Diﬀ(K). We show that

Ω := {φ − idK : φ ∈ Diﬀ∂K(K)}

is an open 0-neighbourhood in C ∞
consider Diﬀ∂K(K) as a smooth manifold modelled on C ∞

∂K(K, Rn) (see Section 3), enabling us to

∂K(K, Rn) with

Diﬀ∂K(K) → Ω, φ 7→ φ − idK

as a global chart. As our main result, we obtain (see Sections 4, 5 and 6):

Theorem A. Diﬀ ∂K(K) is a C 0-regular Lie group.

Recall that, if G is a Lie group modelled on a locally convex space E, with
multiplication µ : G × G → G, then the tangent map T µ : T (G × G) ∼=
T G × T G → T G restricts to a smooth right action

T G × G → T G,

(v, g) 7→ v.g

(identifying G with the zero-section in T G). Let g := L(G) := TeG ∼= E be
the Lie algebra of G (the tangent space at the neutral element e). The Lie
group G is called C 0-regular if for each γ ∈ C([0, 1], g), there is a (necessarily
unique) C 1-curve Evolr(γ) := η : [0, 1] → G such that η(0) = e and

η′(t) = γ(t).η(t)

for all t ∈ [0, 1],

and moreover the map

evolr : C([0, 1], g) → G,

γ 7→ Evolr(γ)(1)

is smooth (using the compact-open topology on the left); cf. [5], [13], [23].

2

If G is C 0-regular, then G is regular (i.e., it has the analogous property
with C ∞([0, 1], g) in place of C([0, 1], g)). Regularity is a central concept in
inﬁnite-dimensional Lie theory, and needed as a hypotheses in many results
of this theory. We refer to [22] and [23] for more information (cf. also [18]).
Proofs for regularity properties of diﬀeomorphism groups can be found, e.g.,
in [16], [18], [19], [22], [28], and [29].

Previously, mappings of the form φ 7→ φ−id have been used as a global chart
for the Lie group Diﬀ c(Rn) of compactly supported smooth diﬀeomorphisms
of Rn [10], for certain weighted diﬀeomorphism groups of Rn (like Lie groups
of rapidly decreasing diﬀeomorphisms) [29], and for further more specialized
diﬀeomorphism groups [19].

Compared to classical discussions of Diﬀ(M) for a manifold M, we encounter
the diﬃculty that neither the inverse function theorem, nor the implicit func-
tion theorem, nor smooth dependence of ﬁxed points on parameters is readily
available in the literature for mappings on suﬃciently general non-open sets
(like K). We therefore have to develop such tools as far as required for our
purposes. We also have to develop a theory of ordinary diﬀerential equations
on K, as the C 0-regularity of Diﬀ∂K(K) is closely linked to ﬂows of diﬀeren-
tial equations on K. In particular, we ﬁnd that integral curves for smooth
time-dependent vector ﬁelds on K behave as nicely as in the classical case
of a compact smooth manifold without boundary, as long as the vector ﬁelds
vanish on ∂K (see Section 7):

Theorem B. Let J ⊆ R be a non-degenerate interval, K ⊆ Rn a compact
convex set with non-empty interior, P ⊆ F be a convex subset with non-empty
interior in a locally convex space F , and

f : P × J × K → Rn

be a smooth function such that f (p, t, x) = 0 for all p ∈ P , t ∈ J and x ∈ ∂K.
Then the initial value problem

y′(t) = f (p, t, y(t)),

y(t0) = x0

has a unique solution yp,t0,x0 : J → K deﬁned on all of J, for all p ∈ P ,
t0 ∈ J, and x0 ∈ K. The associated ﬂow

P × J × J × K → K,

(p, t0, t, x0) 7→ yp,t0,x0(t)

3

is smooth.

Beyond Diﬀ ∂K(K), for K as before and r ∈ N ∪ {∞} we consider the group
DiﬀC r
∂K(K) of all C r-diﬀeomorphisms φ : K → K with φ|∂K = id∂K. For
r ∈ N, we make DiﬀC r
∂K(K) a smooth Banach manifold with a global chart
and show that it is a topological group and has smooth right translations

ρφ : Diﬀ C r

∂K(K) → Diﬀ C r

∂K(K), ψ 7→ ψ ◦ φ

for all φ ∈ DiﬀC r
composition map

∂K(K). Moreover, for all r ∈ N ∪ {∞} and s ∈ N0 ∪ {∞}, the

Diﬀ C r+s

∂K (K) × Diﬀ C r

∂K(K) → DiﬀC r

∂K(K), (ψ, φ) 7→ ψ ◦ φ

and the inversion map

Diﬀ C r+s

∂K (K) → Diﬀ C r

∂K(K), φ 7→ φ−1

are C s (see Sections 3, 4, and 5). Such reﬁned information was basic in the
ILB-approach to inﬁnite-dimensional Lie groups (see [26] and the references
therein). We shall also see that the map

DiﬀC r

∂K(K) × K → K,

(φ, y) 7→ φ−1(y)

(1)

is C r, as a special case of an inverse function theorem with parameters:

Theorem C. Let F be a locally convex space, U ⊆ F be a convex subset with
non-empty interior, r ∈ N ∪ {∞} and f : U × K → K be a C r-map such that
fz := f (z, •) ∈ DiﬀC r
∂K(K) for all z ∈ U . Then also the following map is C r:

g : U × K → K,

(z, y) 7→ (fz)−1(y).

For K as before, let Diﬀ ﬂat(K) be the group of all φ ∈ Diﬀ∂K(K) such that
not only φ − idK, but also all derivatives of this mapping vanish on ∂K. In
Section 8, we show:

Theorem D. Diﬀ ﬂat(K) is a C 0-regular Lie subgroup of Diﬀ ∂K(K).
As a special case of our considerations, we obtain a C 0-regular smooth Lie
group structure on the index 2 subgroup Diﬀ([0, 1])+ := Diﬀ {0,1}([0, 1]) ⊆
Diﬀ([0, 1]) of all orientation-preserving smooth diﬀeomorphisms of [0, 1]. It

4

is now easy to make also Diﬀ([0, 1]) a Lie group with Diﬀ([0, 1])+ as an open
submanifold.2 The Lie group Diﬀ([0, 1])+ is also of pedagogical interest, as
it is the diﬀeomorphism group whose Lie group structure is most easily ob-
tained, using only a minimum of analysis and geometry (already Diﬀ(S1)+
and Diﬀc(R) are more complicated to discuss). The paper places this con-
struction in a larger context and provides relevant, more diﬃcult additional
information (like C 0-regularity).

Note that the Lie group structure on Diﬀ ﬂat(K) (but not on Diﬀ∂K(K)) can
be obtained in an alternative fashion, as follows. Consider the vector sub-
space C ∞
∂K(K, Rn) such that also all deriva-

ﬂat(K, Rn) of all γ : K → Rn in C ∞

tives of γ vanish on ∂K. Then γ extends via 0 to a smooth mapeγ : Rn → Rn

(see, e.g., [25, Proposition 3.32]) which is an element of the weighted function
space C ∞
W (Rn, Rn) (as deﬁned in [29]), when the set of weights is chosen as
W := {1, ∞1Rn\K} where 1 is the constant function on Rn with value 1 and
1Rn\K is the characteristic function (indicator function) of the subset Rn \ K
of Rn. It is clear that the map

C ∞

ﬂat(K, Rn) → C ∞

W (Rn, Rn),

is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces, whence

γ 7→eγ

idK +γ 7→ idRn +eγ

Diﬀ ﬂat(K) → DiﬀW (Rn),

is an isomorphism of Lie groups, where DiﬀW (Rn) is a special case of the
weighted diﬀeomorphism groups

Diﬀ W(E) := {φ ∈ Diﬀ(E) : φ − idE, φ−1 − idE ∈ C ∞

W (E, E)}

constructed in [29], for E a real Banach space and W a set of functions
f : E → R∪{±∞} which contains the constant function 1 on E. We mention
that [29] only establishes regularity for weighted diﬀeomorphism groups, not
C 0-regularity.

2Since Diﬀ([0, 1]) is generated by Diﬀ([0, 1])+ and the diﬀeomorphism I : [0, 1] → [0, 1],
x 7→ 1 − x, it suﬃces to show that the map Diﬀ([0, 1])+ → Diﬀ([0, 1])+, φ 7→ I ◦ φ ◦ I (with
I = I −1) is smooth, or equivalently, that the map Ω → Ω, γ 7→ I◦(id[0,1] +γ)◦I−id[0,1] =: η
is smooth. But η = −γ ◦ I = −I ∗(γ) is the negative of the pullback of γ along I, where
I ∗ a continuous linear (and hence smooth) self-map of C∞

{0,1}([0, 1]) (see [15], cf. [9]).

1 Preliminaries and notation

We write N = {1, 2, . . .} and N0 := N ∪ {0}. All locally convex (topological
real vector) spaces and all compact topological spaces are assumed Hausdorﬀ.
We write graph(f ) := {(x, f (x)) : x ∈ X} ⊆ X ×Y for the graph of a function
f : X → Y . If f : X → Y is a function between metric spaces (X, dX) and
(Y, dY ), we deﬁne

Lip(f ) := sup(cid:26) dY (f (x), f (y))

dX(x, y)

: x 6= y ∈ X(cid:27) ∈ [0, ∞]

r (x) := {y ∈ E : ky − xk < r} and B

and call f Lipschitz if Lip(f ) < ∞. If (E, k.k) is a Banach space, we write
GL(E) for the group of continuous automorphisms of the vector space E. For
E
x ∈ E and r > 0, we write BE
r (x) :=
{y ∈ E : ky −xk ≤ r}. A subset U of a locally convex space E is called locally
convex if, for each x ∈ U, there exists a convex neighbourhood of x in U (with
respect to the induced topology). If q is a continuous seminorm on E, we
q
r(0) := {x ∈ E : q(x) ≤ r} for r > 0. Given locally convex spaces E
write B
and F , we write L(E, F )b for the space of continuous linear mappings from
E to F , endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets.
We abbreviate L(E) := L(E, E).

We shall use a setting of C r-maps between open subsets of locally convex
spaces which goes back to A. Bastiani [3] and is also known as Keller’s C r
c -
theory. See [8], [15], [16], [21] and [22] for streamlined introductions, cf. also
[4]. For a discussion of C r-maps on non-open domains (as in 1.3), see [15].

1.1 If E and F are locally convex spaces, U ⊆ E is open and r ∈ N0 ∪ {∞},
then a map f : U → F is called C r if it is continuous, the iterated directional
derivatives

d(k)f (x, y1, . . . , yk) := (Dyk · · · Dy1f )(x)

exist for all k ∈ N such that k ≤ r, all points x ∈ U and all directions
y1, . . . , yk ∈ E, and the maps d(k)f : U × Ek → F so obtained are continuous.
If r ≥ 1, then a map f as before is C r if and only if f is C 1 and df :=
d(1)f : U × E → F is C r−1 (see, e.g., [8] or [15]).

1.2 (Rule on partial diﬀerentials). If E, F , and H are locally convex spaces,
U ⊆ E and V ⊆ F open subsets and f : U × V → H a continuous map, then
f is C 1 if and only if the directional derivatives

d1f (x, y; x1) := (D(x1,0)f )(x, y) and d2f (x, y; y1) := (D(0,y1)f )(x, y)

6

exist for all x ∈ U, y ∈ V , x1 ∈ E and y1 ∈ F , and deﬁne continuous
functions d1f : U × V × E → H and d2f : U × V × F → H. In this case,

df ((x, y), (x1, y1)) = d1f (x, y; x1) + d2f (x, y; y1)

for all (x, y) ∈ U × V and (x1, y1) ∈ E × F (see [8]).

1.3 If U is replaced with a locally convex subset U ⊆ E with dense inte-
rior U 0 in 1.1, then a map f : U → F is called C r if f is continuous, f |U 0
is C r and d(k)(f |U 0) : U 0 × Ek → F has a (necessarily unique) continuous
extension d(k)f : U × Ek → F for all k ∈ N such that k ≤ r. Then

f (k)(x) := d(k)f (x, •) : Ek → F

is a continuous symmetric k-linear map, for each k as before and x ∈ U (see
[15]). We abbreviate df := d(1)f and f ′(x) := f (1)(x) = df (x, •), which is a
continuous linear map from E to F .

1.4 In the preceding situation, we endow the space C r(U, F ) of all C r-maps
f : U → F with the so-called compact-open C r-topology, i.e., the initial topol-
ogy with respect to the linear maps

C r(U, F ) → C(U × Ek, F )c.o.,

f 7→ d(k)f

for all k ∈ N0 with k ≤ r (with d(0)f := f ), where the spaces on the right
hand side are endowed with the compact-open topology.

1.5 If J ⊆ R is a non-degenerate interval and γ : J → E a C 1-curve, as
usual we write γ′(t) := dγ
dt (t) = (D1γ)(t) ∈ E for t ∈ J; no confusion with
γ′ : J → L(R, E) should arise (as the meaning will be clear from the context).

1.6 Let E, F , and H be locally convex spaces, U ⊆ E and V ⊆ F be locally
convex subsets with dense interior, r, s ∈ N0 ∪ {∞} and f : U × V → H
be a map (more generally, if r = 0, then U can be any topological space).
Following [1] and [2], f is called a C r,s-map if f is continuous, the iterated
directional derivatives

d(k,ℓ)f (x, y, x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yℓ) := (D(xk,0) · · · D(x1,0)D(0,yℓ) · · · D(0,y1)f )(x, y)

exist for all k, ℓ ∈ N0 with k ≤ r and ℓ ≤ s and all (x, y) ∈ U 0 × V 0,
x1, . . . , xk ∈ E and y1, . . . , yℓ ∈ F , and admit continuous extensions

d(k,ℓ)f : U × V × Ek × F ℓ → H.

7

We shall frequently use the following exponential law : If f : U × V → H is
C r,s, then f ∨(x) := f (x, •) ∈ C s(V, H) for all x ∈ U, and the map

f ∨ : U → C s(V, H),

x 7→ f (x, •)

is C r [2, Theorem 3.25 (a)]. If V is, moreover, locally compact and a function
g : U → C s(V, E) is C r, then

bg : U × V → H,

bg(x, y) := g(x)(y)

is C r,s [2, Theorem 3.28 (a)]. An analogous deﬁnition of C α1,...,αn-maps on
n-fold direct products is possible for α1, . . . , αn ∈ N0 ∪ {∞}, and again an
exponential law is available (see [1]).

Vector-valued integrals depend continuously on parameters (see, e.g., [15]).

1.7 Let U be a topological space, E be a locally convex space and
f : U × [a, b] → E be a continuous map such that the weak integral

g(x) :=Z b

a

f (x, t) dt

exists in E for each x ∈ U. Then g : U → E is continuous.

1.8 If K is a compact topological space and (F, k.kF ) a Banach space, we
write k.k∞ for the supremum norm on C(K, F ) given by

kγk∞ := sup
x∈K

kγ(x)kF

for γ ∈ C(K, F ),

which deﬁnes the compact-open topology on C(K, F ).

If (F, k.kF ) = (L(E1, E2), k.kop) is a space of continuous linear maps between
two Banach spaces (E1, k.k1) and (E2, k.k2) with the operator norm, we write
kγk∞,op instead of k.k∞, for emphasis.

If F is a locally convex space and q a continuous seminorm on F , we deﬁne
a seminorm k.k∞,q on C(K, F ) via

kγk∞,q := sup
x∈K

q(γ(x)).

The compact-open topology on C(K, F ) is deﬁned by the set of all k.k∞,q.

8

1.9 If E := Rn and K ⊆ E is a compact convex subset with non-empty
interior, then the map

D : C 1(K, E) → C(K, L(E)),

γ 7→ γ′

is continuous linear. This follows from the observation that

C 1(K, E) → [0, ∞[ ,

γ 7→ kγ′k∞,op = sup
(x,y)∈L

kdγ(x, y)k

is a continuous seminorm on C 1(K, E) since C 1(K, E) → C(K × E, E),
γ 7→ dγ is a continuous linear map and L := K × B

R
1 (0) is compact.

Lemma 1.10 Let E and F be locally convex spaces, U ⊆ E be a locally
convex subset with dense interior and f : U → F be a C 2-map. Then the
map f ′ : U → L(E, F )b, x 7→ f ′(x) = df (x, •) is continuous.

Proof. Let q be a continuous seminorm on F and B ⊆ E be a bounded set.
By continuity of d(2)f : U × E × E → F , there is a convex neighbourhood
V ⊆ U of x and a continuous seminorm p on E such that

d(2)f (V × B

p
1(0) × B

p
1(0)) ⊆ B

q
1(0).

Then rB ⊆ B
V − x ⊆ B

p
1(0) for some r > 0. After shrinking V , we may assume that

p
r(0). For all y ∈ V and b ∈ B, we deduce that

q((f ′(y) − f ′(x))(b)) = q(df (y, b) − df (x, b))

= q(cid:18)Z 1

and thus (f ′(y) − f ′(x))(B) ⊆ B

1.11 If K is a compact convex subset of E := Rn with non-empty interior
and r ∈ N ∪ {∞}, we let Diﬀ C r
∂K(K) be the group of all C r-diﬀeomorphisms φ
of K such that φ|∂K = id∂K. We let C r
∂K(K, E) ⊆ C r(K, E) be the closed
vector subspace of all γ ∈ C r(K, E) such that γ|∂K = 0. We abbreviate
Diﬀ∂K(K) := DiﬀC∞

∂K (K).

2 Auxiliary results

The following fact is well-known; the simple proof is recalled in Appendix A.

Lemma 2.1 Let f : X → K be a map from a topological space X to a Haus-
dorﬀ topological space K.

(a) If f is continuous, then its graph graph(f ) is closed in X × K.

(b) If K is compact, then f is continuous if and only if graph(f ) is closed.

Lemma 2.2 Let X be a topological space, K a compact topological space and
f : X × K → K be a continuous mapping such that

fx := f (x, •) : K → K,

y 7→ f (x, y)

is bijective for each x ∈ K. Then the map

g : X × K → K,

(x, z) 7→ (fx)−1(z)

is continuous and h : X×K → X×K, (x, y) 7→ (x, f (x, y)) a homeomorphism.

Proof. Because f is continuous, graph(f ) is closed in X × K × K (see
Lemma 2.1). Since

σ : X × K × K → X × K × K,

(x, y, z) 7→ (x, z, y)

is a homeomorphism, also graph(g) = σ(graph(f )) is closed in X × K × K.
Hence g is continuous, by Lemma 2.1 (b). It is immediate from the deﬁnition
that the continuous map h is a bijection with inverse

h−1(x, z) = (x, (fx)−1(z)) = (x, g(x, z)).

As g is continuous, h−1 is continuous and thus h is a homeomorphism.

✷

The following lemma generalizes a special case stated in [16, Theorem 5.3.1].

10

Lemma 2.3 Let E and F be locally convex spaces, U ⊆ E a locally convex
subset with dense interior, k ∈ N ∪ {∞} and

f : U × F → F

be a C k-map such that fx := f (x, •) : F → F is linear and bijective for each
x ∈ U and the map

g : U × F → F,

g(x, z) := (fx)−1(z)

is continuous. Then g is C k.

Proof. Since g(x, •) is continuous linear for x ∈ U 0, we have

d2g(x, z; w) = g(x, w)

for all x ∈ U 0, z, w ∈ F , and the same formula deﬁnes a continuous extension
for (x, z, w) ∈ U × F × F . Let x ∈ U 0, y ∈ E, z ∈ F and 0 6= t ∈ R with
x + ty ∈ U 0. Then

fx(cid:18)g(x + ty, z) − g(x, z)

t

(cid:19) =

fx(g(x + ty, z)) − z

t

(fx − fx+ty)(g(x + ty, z))

(2)

t

d1f (x + sty, g(x + ty, z); y) ds, (3)

=

= −Z 1

0

using that fx(g(x, z)) = z = fx+ty(g(x + ty, z)). By 1.7, the integral in (3)
0 d1f (x, g(x, z); y) ds = −d1f (x, g(x, z); y) as t → 0. Apply-

ing now the continuous linear map (fx)−1 to (2) and (3), we see that

converges to −R 1

g(x + ty, z) − g(x, z)

t

→ −(fx)−1(d1f (x, g(x, z); y))

= −g(x, d1f (x, g(x, z); y))

as t → 0. Thus d1g(x, z; y) = g(x, d1f (x, g(x, z); y)) and the same formula
deﬁnes a continuous F -valued function of (x, z, y) ∈ U × F × E. Using 1.2,
we ﬁnd that g is C 1, with

dg(x, z, y, w) = d1g(x, z; y) + d2g(x, z; w) = g(x, w) − g(x, d1f (x, g(x, z); y))

for (x, z, y, w) ∈ U × F × E × F . Now if g is C k−1 by induction, then the
preceding formula shows that also dg is C k−1, and thus g is C k.
✷

We shall use a result on the parameter-dependence of ﬁxed points.

Lemma 2.4 Let E be a locally convex space, (F, k.k) a Banach space, P ⊆ E
and V ⊆ F be locally convex subsets with dense interior, k ∈ N0 ∪ {∞} and

f : P × V → F

be a C k-map which deﬁnes a “uniform family of contractions” in the sense
that fp := f (p, •) : V → F is Lipschitz for each p ∈ P with

θ := sup
p∈P

Lip(fp) < 1.

Assume that fp has a (necessarily unique) ﬁxed point xp for each p ∈ P and
deﬁne φ : P → V , φ(p) := xp. Then the following holds:

(a) If V is open, then φ : P → V is C k.

(b) If φ : P → V is continuous and k ≥ 2, then φ is C k.

(c) If φ is continuous, f is C 1 and the map

g : P × V → (L(F ), k.kop),

(p, x) 7→ d2f (p, x; •)

(4)

is continuous, then φ is C 1.

Proof. (a) is a special case of [12, Theorem D].

(b) and (c). It suﬃces to consider k ∈ N. Let λ : F → E × F , x 7→ (0, x)

be the continuous linear inclusion map. Then the linear mapping

L(λ, F ) : L(E × F, F ) → L(F, F ), A 7→ A ◦ λ

is continuous. If f is C 2, then the map g = L(λ, F )◦f ′ from (4) is continuous
as a consequence of Lemma 1.10. We may therefore assume continuity of g
now and prove the assertion by induction on k ∈ N. Note that

kd2f (p, x; •)kop ≤ θ < 1

since Lip(fp) ≤ θ. Hence idF −d2f (p, x; •) ∈ GL(F ) for all (p, x) ∈ P × V .
The inversion map GL(F ) → GL(F ), A 7→ A−1 being continuous, also

P × V → L(F ),

(p, x) 7→ (idF −g(p, x))−1

is continuous and hence also the map

P × V × F → F,

(p, x, z) 7→ (idF −g(p, x))−1(z),

(5)

12

as the evaluation map L(F ) × F → F , (A, x) 7→ A(x) is continuous. Since

h : (P × V ) × F → F,

(p, x, y) 7→ y − d2f (p, x; y)

is C k−1, writing hp,x := h(p, x, •) we deduce with Lemma 2.3 that the map

Θ : P × V × F → F,

(p, x, z) 7→ (hp,x)−1(z)

(which coincides with the map in (5)) is C k−1. We know from (a) that φ|P 0
is C k. Now

f (p, φ(p)) = φ(p).

(6)

Using the Chain Rule, we can form the directional derivative at p ∈ P 0 in a
direction q ∈ E on both sides of (6) and obtain the identity

d1f (p, φ(p); q) + d2f (p, φ(p); dφ(p, q)) = dφ(p, q),

which can be solved for dφ(p, q):

dφ(p, q) = (idF −d2f (p, φ(p); •)−1(d1f (p, φ(p); q) = Θ(p, φ(p), d1f (p, φ(p); q)).

Note that term on the right hand side also deﬁnes a continuous F -valued
function of (p, q) ∈ P × E. Hence φ is C 1 with

dφ(p, q) = Θ(p, φ(p), d1f (p, φ(p); q)).

Now if φ is C k−1 by induction, then the previous identity shows that also dφ
is C k−1, and thus φ is C k.

3 Submanifold structure and global chart

Let K be a compact convex subset with non-empty interior in E := Rn and
r ∈ N ∪ {∞}. We show:

Lemma 3.1 DiﬀC r
the closed vector subspace C r
admits a global chart.

∂K(K) is a smooth submanifold of C r(K, E) modelled on
∂K(K)

∂K(K, E) of C r(K, E). Moreover, DiﬀC r

13

Proof. The aﬃne vector subspace idK +C r
C r(K, E) modelled on the closed vector subspace C r

∂K(K, E) is a C ∞-submanifold of
∂K(K, E) of C r(K, E), as

Ψ : C r(K, E) → C r(K, E), φ 7→ φ − idK

is a C ∞-diﬀeomorphism (and hence a global chart for C r(K, E)) such that

Ψ(idK +C r

∂K(K, E)) = C r

∂K(K, E).

We claim that

Ωr := DiﬀC r

∂K(K) − idK

∂K(K, E).

is open in C r
open in the submanifold idK +C r
DiﬀC r

∂K(K) will be (relatively)
∂K(K, E) of C r(K, E), entailing that also
∂K(K, E). Moreover,

If this is true, then Diﬀ C r

∂K(K) is a submanifold of C r(K, E) modelled on C r

Φr : Diﬀ C r

∂K(K) → Ωr, φ 7→ φ − idK

will be a global chart for DiﬀC r
claim, let x0 ∈ K 0. Fix a norm k.k on E = Rn and write

∂K(K) (establishing the lemma). To prove the

kηk∞,op := sup
x∈K

kη(x)kop

for continuous functions η : K → L(E). Let

Qr ⊆ C r

∂K(K, E)

∂K(K, E) such that γ′(K) ⊆ GL(E) − idE holds,
be the set of all γ ∈ C r
x0 + γ(x0) ∈ K 0, and idK +γ is injective. It is clear that φ − idK ∈ Qr for
each φ ∈ DiﬀC r

∂K(K) and thus

Ωr ⊆ Qr.

To see that Ωr = Qr, let γ ∈ Qr. Then φ := idK +γ : K → E is injective.
We show that φ ∈ Diﬀ C r

∂K(K) (whence γ = φ − idK ∈ Ωr). Since

φ′(x) = idE +γ′(x) ∈ GL(E)

for each x ∈ K 0 and φ|K 0 is injective, we deduce from the inverse function the-
orem that φ(K 0) is open in E and φ|K 0 : K 0 → φ(K0) is a C r-diﬀeomorphism.
Since γ|∂K = 0, we have φ|∂K = id∂K and hence

φ(∂K) = ∂K.

14

As φ is injective, this implies that

φ(K 0) ∩ ∂K = ∅.

Therefore K 0 is the disjoint union of the open set φ−1(E \ K) and the open
set φ−1(K 0) which is non-empty as φ(x0) ∈ K 0 by deﬁnition of Qr. Since K 0
is convex and hence connected, we deduce that φ−1(E \ K) = ∅ and hence

Now φ(K 0) is open in K 0 but it is also (relatively) closed in K 0 since

φ(K 0) ⊆ K 0.

φ(K 0) = φ(K 0) ∪ K 0 ∩ φ(∂K)

= K 0 ∩ φ(K)

|

=∅

{z

}

where φ(K) is compact and hence closed in E. Since φ(K 0) is non-empty,
the connectedness of K 0 implies that φ(K 0) = K 0. Thus φ is surjective
and hence φ (being also injective) is a bijection. Since K is compact, the
continuous bijection φ : K → K is a homeomorphism. As φ is C r, the map
dφ : K × E → E is C r−1 and hence C r−1,0 (cf. [2, Lemma 3.17]), entailing
that

φ′ = (dφ)∨ : K → GL(E) ⊆ C(E, E)

is C r−1 (see [2, Theorem 3.25 (a)]). We know that

is C r and

φ−1|K 0 = (φ|K 0)−1

(φ−1)′(y) = (φ′(φ−1(y)))−1

for each y ∈ K 0. As the inversion map GL(E) → GL(E) is smooth and
hence continuous, we deduce that the map

ψ : K → GL(E),

y 7→ (φ′(φ−1(y)))−1

(7)

is continuous. Because the evaluation map ε : L(E) × E → E is continuous
bilinear (and thus smooth, for later use), we see that also the map

bψ : K × E → E,

(y, z) 7→ ψ(y)(z) = ε(ψ(y), z)

is continuous. By the preceding, bψ : K × E → E is a continuous extension of
d(φ−1|K 0). Hence φ−1 is C 1 with d(φ−1) = bψ. If now φ−1 is C k−1 by induction

15

for an integer 2 ≤ k ≤ r, then (7) and the Chain Rule entail that ψ is C k−1.

Hence bψ = d(φ−1) is C k−1,0 (see [2, Theorem 3.28]), whence d(φ−1) is C k−1,∞

by linearity in the second argument (see [2, Lemma 3.14]). Thus d(φ−1) is
C k−1, by [2, Lemma 3.15], entailing that φ−1 is C k and thus C r. Hence
φ ∈ Diﬀ C r

∂K(K), as desired.

To see that Ωr is open, note that the point evaluation εx0 : C r
γ 7→ γ(x0) is continuous linear. Moreover, the map

∂K(K, E) → E,

C r(K, E) → C(K, L(E)),

γ 7→ γ′

is continuous linear and GL(E) − idE is open in L(E). Hence

U := {γ ∈ C r

∂K(K, E) : γ′(K) ⊆ GL(E) − idE and γ(x0) ∈ K 0 − x0}

is open in C r

∂K(K, E). Let γ ∈ Ωr; then φ := idK +γ ∈ Diﬀ C r

∂K(K) and thus

a := Lip(φ−1) = k(φ−1)′k∞,op < ∞.

Now

V :=nη ∈ U : kη′ − γ′k∞,op <

1

2ao

is an open neighbourhood of γ in U (and hence also in C r
that V ⊆ Qr = Ωr (completing the proof that Ωr is open). The estimate

∂K(K, E)). We show

ky−xk = kφ−1(φ(y))−φ−1(φ(x))k ≤ Lip(φ−1)kφ(y)−φ(x)k = akφ(y)−φ(x)k

implies that kφ(y) − φ(x)k ≥ 1
x, y ∈ K with x 6= y, this entails

aky − xk for all x, y ∈ K. For η ∈ V and

1
a

ky − xk ≤ kφ(y) − φ(x)k

≤ k(idK +η)(y) − (idK +η)(x)k + k(η − γ)(y) − (η − γ)(x)k
≤ k(idK +η)(y) − (idK +η)(x)k + Lip(η − γ)ky − xk

≤ k(idK +η)(y) − (idK +η)(x)k +

ky − xk,

1
2a
2a . Hence

using that Lip(η − γ) = kγ′ − η′k∞,op < 1

k(idK +η)(y) − (idK +η)(x)k ≥

1
2a

ky − xk > 0

and thus x + η(x) 6= y + η(y). Thus idK +η is injective, whence η ∈ Qr and
hence V ⊆ Qr.
✷

4 Smoothness of composition

In this section, we establish continuity and diﬀerentiability properties of the
composition map Diﬀ C r
∂K(K), and related results.

∂K(K) → DiﬀC r

∂K(K) × DiﬀC r

Lemma 4.1 Let K be a compact convex subset of E := Rn with non-empty
interior, V a closed convex subset of a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space E2 with
non-empty interior, and F be a locally convex space. For all r, s ∈ N0 ∪ {∞},

C r(K, V ) := {η ∈ C r(K, E2) : η(K) ⊆ V }

is a convex subset of C r(K, E2) with non-empty interior and

Γ : C r+s(V, F ) × C r(K, V ) → C r(K, F ), Γ(γ, η) := γ ◦ η

is a C s-mapping. If s ≥ 1, then

dΓ(γ, η; γ1, η1) = γ1 ◦ η + dγ ◦ (η, η1)

(8)

for all γ, γ1 ∈ C r+s(V, F ), η ∈ C r(K, V ), and η1 ∈ C r(K, E2). In particular,

µ : DiﬀC r+s

∂K (K) × Diﬀ C r

∂K(K) → Diﬀ C r

∂K(K),

(γ, η) 7→ γ ◦ η

is C s, for all r ∈ N ∪ {∞} and s ∈ N0 ∪ {∞}. For each η ∈ Diﬀ C r
right translation map ρη : DiﬀC r

∂K(K) → Diﬀ C r

∂K(K), γ 7→ γ ◦ η is smooth.

∂K(K), the

It is clear that C r(K, V ) is convex and C r(K, V 0) ⊆ C r(K, V )0.

Proof.
Actually, C r(K, V 0) = C r(K, V )0 holds.3

By [2, Theorem 3.25 (a)], the map Γ will be C s if we can show that the map

bΓ : (C r+s(V, F ) × C r(K, V )) × K → F, bΓ(γ, η, x) := Γ(γ, η)(x) = γ(η(x))

is C s,r. Now

(9)
where ε : C r(K, E2)×K → E2, ε(η, x) := η(x) is C ∞,r and the corresponding
evaluation map ε1 : C r+s(V, F )×V → F is C ∞,r+s. Applying the Chain Rule

bΓ(γ, η, x) = ε1(γ, ε(η, x))

3Suppose there is η ∈ C r(K, V )0 \ C r(K, V 0); then η(x0) ∈ V \ V 0 for some x0 ∈ K.
Now η + c ∈ C r(K, V )0 for all c in a 0-neighbourhood U ⊆ E2 (identiﬁed with the
corresponding constant function x 7→ c). Evaluating at x0, we see that η(x0) + U ⊆ V and
hence η(x0) ∈ V 0, contradiction.

17

in the form [1, Lemma 81] to the right hand side of (9), we see thatbΓ is C ∞,s,r

in (γ, η, x) and hence C s,r in ((γ, η), x), by [1, Lemma 77].

Since Γ(γ, η) is a continuous linear function of γ ∈ C r+s(V, F ) for ﬁxed
η ∈ C r(K, V ), the ﬁrst partial diﬀerential always exists and is given by

d1Γ(γ, η; γ1) = Γ(γ1, η) = γ1 ◦ η.

(10)

If s ≥ 1 and γ ∈ C r+s(V, F ), then

Γ(γ, •) = C r(K, γ) : C r(K, V ) → C r(K, F ),

η 7→ γ ◦ η

with dC r(K, γ) = C r(K, dγ) (identifying the space C r(K, E2 × E2) with
C r(K, E2) × C r(K, E2)), see, e.g., [15], cf. also [9]. Hence

dΓ(γ, η, γ1, η1) = d1Γ(γ, η; γ1) + d2Γ(γ, η; η1) = γ1 ◦ η + dγ ◦ (η, η1),

establishing (8). Since DiﬀC r
∂K(K) is a submanifold of C r(K, E), it suﬃces to
show that µ is C s as a map to C r(K, E). But this is the restriction of Γ (for
E2 := F := E and V := K) to the submanifold DiﬀC r+s
∂K(K) of
C r+s(K, E) × C r(K, E) and hence C s (like Γ). For each η ∈ Diﬀ C r
∂K(K), the
map Γ(•, η) : γ 7→ γ ◦ η is continuous linear and hence smooth, entailing that
also ρη = Γ(•, η)|DiﬀCr
✷

∂K (K) × Diﬀ C r

∂K (K) is smooth.

5 Smoothness of inversion and Theorem C

We prove Theorem C. As a byproduct, we obtain continuity and diﬀerentia-
bility properties for the inversion map DiﬀC r

∂K(K) → Diﬀ C r

∂K(K), φ 7→ φ−1.

Proof of Theorem C. As before, E := Rn and K ⊆ E. We show by
induction that g is C k for all k ∈ N0 with k ≤ r. Since g is continuous
by Lemma 2.2, the case k = 0 is settled. Now assume that k ≥ 1. Since
f (z, •) : K 0 → K 0 is a C r-diﬀeomorphism for each z ∈ U 0, we deduce that

ψ : U 0 × K 0 → U 0 × K 0, ψ(z, x) := (z, f (z, x))

is a bijection. Since d2f (z, x; •) = (fz)′(x) ∈ GL(E) for each z ∈ U 0 and
x ∈ K 0, the Inverse Function Theorem with Parameters (in the form [11,
Theorem 2.3 (c)]) shows that ψ is a C r-diﬀeomorphism (being bijective and
a local C r-diﬀeomorphism around each point). Note that

dψ(z, x, z1, x1) = (z1, d1f (z, x; z1) + d2f (z, x; x1))

18

for all z ∈ U 0, z1 ∈ F , x ∈ K 0, and x1 ∈ E (using the Rule on Partial
Diﬀerentials). Recalling the familiar identity

(ψ−1)′(z, y) = (ψ′(ψ−1(z, y)))−1,

we deduce that

(ψ−1)′(z, y, z1, y1) = (z1, ((fz)′(x))−1(y1 − d1f (z, x; z1)))

(11)

for all z ∈ U 0, z1 ∈ F , y ∈ K 0, and y1 ∈ E, with x := (fz)−1(y) = g(z, y).
Since ψ−1(z, y) = (z, g(z, y)), looking at the second component of (11) we
see that g|U 0×K 0 is C r (like ψ−1), with

d(g|U 0×K 0)(z, y, z1, y1) = ((fz)′(g(z, y)))−1(y1 − d1f (z, g(z, y); z1))

(12)

for all z ∈ U 0, z1 ∈ F , y ∈ K 0, and y1 ∈ E. Let I : GL(E) → GL(E),
A 7→ A−1 be the smooth (and hence continuous) inversion map. The mapping

h : U × K × E → E,

h(z, y, v) := d2f (z, g(z, y); v)

is continuous and hz,y := h(z, y, •) = (fz)′(g(z, y)) ∈ GL(E) for all (z, y) ∈
U ×K. Hence h∨ : U ×K → GL(E) ⊆ C(E, E), h∨(z, y) := hz,y is continuous.
As a consequence, I ◦ h∨ : U × K → GL(E) is continuous, whence also the
map

β := \I ◦ h∨ : U × K × E → E,

(z, y, w) 7→ h−1

z,y(w)

is continuous. Note that the right hand side of (12) also makes sense for z ∈
U, z1 ∈ F , y ∈ K and y1 ∈ E, and deﬁnes a function θ : U × K × F × E → E,

θ(z, y, z1, y1)

:= ((fz)′(g(z, y)))−1(y1 − d1f (z, g(z, y; z1)))
= β(z, y, y1 − d1f (z, g(z, y); z1))

(13)

which is continuous. As this mapping extends d(g|U 0×K 0) by (12), we see
that g is C 1 with dg = θ. If now k ≥ 2 and g is C k−1 by induction, then h
is C k−1 and thus β is C k−1, by Lemma 2.3. Hence dg = θ is C k−1 (see (13))
and thus g is C k, which completes the inductive proof.
✷

For each r ∈ N ∪ {∞}, the evaluation map C r(K, E) × K → E is C ∞,r and
hence C r (see [2, Proposition 3.20 and Lemma 3.15]), whence its restriction

f : DiﬀC r

∂K(K) × K → K,

f (φ, x) := φ(x)

19

is C r as well. Since f (φ, •) = φ ∈ DiﬀC r
mapping in (1) is C r. If r ∈ N ∪ {∞} and s ∈ N0 ∪ {∞}, then the map

∂K(K), Theorem C shows that the

h : DiﬀC r+s

∂K (K) × K → K,

(φ, y) 7→ φ−1(y)

is C r+s by the preceding and hence C s,r, entailing that

h∨ : DiﬀC r+s

∂K (K) → C r(K, E), φ 7→ φ−1

is C s as a map to C r(K, E) (by [2, Theorem 3.25 (a)]) and hence also as a
map to its submanifold Diﬀ C r

∂K(K).

6 Regularity

We shall use a standard fact from the theory of ordinary diﬀerential equations
(a quantitative version of the Picard-Lindel¨of Theorem):4

Lemma 6.1 Let E be a Banach space, R > 0, x0 ∈ E and

f : [0, 1] × B

E
R(x0) → E

be a bounded continuous function which satisﬁes a global Lipschitz condition,

L := sup
t∈[0,1]

Lip(f (t, •)) < ∞.

If kf k∞ ≤ R and L < 1, then there is a (unique) C 1-function γ : [0, 1] →
B

R(x0) such that γ′(t) = f (t, γ(t)) for all t ∈ [0, 1] and γ(0) = x0.

E

Proof. A := {η ∈ C([0, 1], B
Banach space (C([0, 1], E), k.k∞) and

E
R(x0)) : η(0) = x0} is a closed subset of the

ψ : A → A, ψ(η)(t) := x0 +Z t

0

f (s, η(s)) ds

If L < 1, then ψ is a contraction, and hence ψ has
is a self-map of A.
a unique ﬁxed point γ (by Banach’s Fixed Point Theorem), which (by the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus) is the unique C 1-solution γ of the initial
value problem described in the lemma.
✷
Let E := Rn and K ⊆ E be a compact convex set with non-empty interior.

4The condition L < 1 is actually superﬂuous; one can use the Fixed Point Theorem of

Banach-Weissinger [30] instead of the standard Banach Fixed Point Theorem.

20

Lemma 6.2 The following map is smooth:

h : C([0, 1], C ∞(K, E))×C([0, 1], K) → C([0, 1], E), h(γ, η)(t) := γ(t)(η(t)).

Proof. If we can show thatbh : C([0, 1], C ∞(K, E))×C([0, 1], K)×[0, 1] → E,
bh(γ, η, t) := h(γ, η)(t) is C ∞,0 as a function of ((γ, η), t), then h = (bh)∨ will

be C ∞ by [2, Theorem 3.25 (a)]. We have

bh(γ, η, t) = γ(t)(η(t)) = ε1(ε2(γ, t), ε3(η, t))

where the evaluation maps ε3 : C([0, 1], K) × [0, 1] → K and

ε2 : C([0, 1], C ∞(K, E)) × [0, 1] → C ∞(K, E)

are C ∞,0 and the evaluation map ε1 : C ∞(K, E) × K → E is C ∞,∞ (see [2,
Proposition 3.20]). Now the map

C([0, 1], C ∞(K, E)) × C([0, 1], K) × [0, 1] × [0, 1] → E

which sends (γ, η, s, t) to ε1(ε2(γ, s), ε3(η, t)) is C ∞,∞,0,0 by [1, Lemma 81]
and thus C ∞,0 in ((γ, η), (s, t)) (using [1, Lemma 77] twice). Composing
✷

with t 7→ (t, t), we deduce with [2, Lemma 3.17] thatbh is C ∞,0.

As before, let E := Rn and K ⊆ E be a compact convex set with non-empty
interior. Let θ ∈ ]0, 1/3]. Since

q : C ∞

∂K(K, E) → [0, ∞[,

η 7→ sup
x∈K

kη′(x)kop = Lip(η)

(14)

is a continuous seminorm, we deduce that

k.k∞,q : C([0, 1], C ∞

∂K(K, E)) → [0, ∞[,

γ 7→ sup
t∈[0,1]

q(γ(t))

is a continuous seminorm on C([0, 1], C ∞

∂K(K, E)). Hence

Q := {γ ∈ C([0, 1], C ∞

∂K(K, E)) : kγk∞,q < θ}

is an open 0-neighbourhood in C([0, 1], C ∞

∂K(K, E)). If γ ∈ Q, then

(t, x) 7→ γ(t)(x)

bγ : [0, 1] × K → E,

21

is a C 0,∞-map (see [2, Theorem 3.28 (a)]) which satisﬁes a global Lipschitz
condition because

sup
t∈[0,1]

Lip(bγ(t, •)) = sup

t∈[0,1]

For x ∈ K, let

Lip(γ(t)) ≤ θ < 1.

(15)

d∂K(x) := min
y∈∂K

ky − xk

be the distance between x and ∂K; the minimum is attained as ∂K is a
non-empty compact set. If η ∈ C ∞
∂K(K, E) with q(η) < θ (e.g. η = γ(t) for
some γ ∈ Q and t ∈ [0, 1]), then

kη(x)k ≤ θd∂K(x)

for all x ∈ K.

(16)

To see this, given x ∈ K pick y ∈ ∂K such that ky − xk = d∂K(x). Noting
that η(y) = 0 since η ∈ C ∞

∂K(K, E) and y ∈ ∂K, we deduce that

kη(x)k = kη(x) − η(y)k ≤ Lip(η)ky − xk ≤ θky − xk = θd∂K(x).

Lemma 6.3 For each γ ∈ Q and x0 ∈ K, the initial value problem

has a unique solution yγ,x0 : [0, 1] → K. The following map is smooth:

y′(t) =bγ(t, y(t)),

y(0) = x0

(17)

φ : Q × K → C([0, 1], K),

(γ, x0) 7→ yγ,x0.

Proof. Since bγ satisﬁes a global Lipschitz condition, solutions to the initial

value problem (17) are unique whenever they exist. If x0 ∈ ∂K, then the
constant function given by yγ,x0(t) := x0 for all t ∈ [0, 1] solves (17).
If
x0 ∈ K 0, then

by Lemma 6.1. Now consider the map f : (Q×K)×C([0, 1], K) → C([0, 1], E),

for t ∈ [0, 1]. Using the continuous linear operator

f (γ, x0, η)(t) := x0 +Z t

0 bγ(s, η(s)) ds
J : C([0, 1], E) → C([0, 1], E), J(ζ)(t) :=Z t

and the function

h : Q × C([0, 1], K) → C([0, 1], K), h(γ, η)(t) :=bγ(t, η(t)) = γ(t)(η(t))

which is smooth by Lemma 6.2, we have

f (γ, x0, η) = x0 + J(h(γ, η)),

where also K → C([0, 1], E), x0 7→ x0 (the constant function t 7→ x0) is
smooth as it is the restriction of the continuous linear map E → C([0, 1], E),
x0 7→ x0. Hence f is smooth. Moreover, f deﬁnes a uniform family of
contractions. In fact, writing fγ,x0 := f (γ, x0, •) : C([0, 1], K) → C([0, 1], E)
for γ ∈ Q and x0 ∈ K, we have

kfγ,x0(η1)(t) − fγ,x0(η)(t)k ≤ Z t

kγ(s)(η1(s)) − γ(s)(η(s))k ds

Lip(γ(s))kη1(s) − η(s)k ds ≤ θkη1 − ηk∞

for all η, η1 ∈ C([0, 1], K) and t ∈ [0, 1] and hence

kfγ,x0(η1) − fγ,x0(η)k∞ ≤ θkη1 − ηk∞

with θ ≤ 1
3 < 1 independent of (γ, x0). By construction, φ(γ, x0) = yγ,x0
is the (unique) ﬁxed point of fγ,x0, for all (γ, x0) ∈ Q × K. In particular,
yγ,x0 ∈ C([0, 1], K 0) (see (18)) is the ﬁxed point of fγ,x0|C([0,1],K 0) for γ ∈ Q
and x0 ∈ K 0. Hence, applying Lemma 2.4 (a) to the restriction

(Q × K 0) × C([0, 1], K 0) → C([0, 1], E), (γ, x0, η) 7→ f (γ, x0, η)

23

of f , which is a C ∞-map on an open domain, we ﬁnd that φ|Q×K 0 is smooth,
and hence continuous. If γ ∈ Q and x0 ∈ ∂K, we shall presently show that

kφ(γ1, x1) − φ(γ, x0)k∞ ≤

2

kx1 − x0k

(19)

for all x1 ∈ K and γ1 ∈ Q. Thus φ will be continuous at (γ, x0) also in this
case. Hence φ will be continuous and so φ will be smooth, by Lemma 2.4 (b).
To establish (19), assume x1 ∈ ∂K ﬁrst. Then φ(γ1, x1)(t) = x1 for all t and
since also φ(γ, x0)(t) = x0 for all t, we obtain

kφ(γ1, x1) − φ(γ, x0)k∞ = kx1 − x0k ≤

3
2

kx1 − x0k.

It remains to consider the case x1 ∈ K 0. Then φ(γ1, x1)(t) ∈ B
t ∈ [0, 1] with R := 1

2kx1 − x0k (see (18)). Hence

2 d∂K(x1) ≤ 1

kφ(γ1, x1)(t) − φ(γ, x0)(t)k = kφ(γ1, x1)(t) − x0k

≤ R + kx1 − x0k ≤

kx1 − x0k

also in this case.

Lemma 6.4 In the situation of Lemma 6.3, also φ : Q × K → C 1([0, 1], E),
(γ, x0) 7→ yγ,x0 is smooth.

Proof. The map Λ : C 1([0, 1], E) → C([0, 1], E) × C([0, 1], E), η 7→ (η, η′) is
a linear topological embedding with closed image [2, Lemma 2.7]. It therefore
suﬃces to show that both components of Λ ◦ φ are smooth (see [15]; cf. [4,
Lemma 10.1 and 10.2]). The ﬁrst of these is φ as a map to C([0, 1], E) and
hence smooth, by Lemma 6.3. The second component is the map

Q × K → C([0, 1], E),

(γ, x0) 7→ (yγ,x0)′, where

(∀t ∈ [0, 1])

(yγ,x0)′(t) =bγ(t, yγ,x0(t)) =bγ(t, φ(γ, x0)(t))

and thus (yγ,x0)′ = h(γ, φ(γ, x0)) with h as Lemma 6.2, which is a smooth
C([0, 1], E)-valued function of (γ, x0) ∈ Q × K by smoothness of h and
smoothness of φ as a map to C([0, 1], K).
✷

Recall that G := Diﬀ ∂K(K) is an open subset of the closed aﬃne subspace
idK +C ∞
∂K(K, E) of C ∞(K, E) and hence a smooth submanifold of C ∞(K, E)

24

modelled on C ∞
∂K(K, E). Identifying the tangent bundle of the locally convex
space C ∞(K, E) with C ∞(K, E)×C ∞(K, E) in the usual way, we also obtain
an identiﬁcation

T Diﬀ∂K(K) = Diﬀ∂K(K) × C ∞

∂K(K, E).

This enables L(G) = TidK (Diﬀ∂K(K)) = {idK} × C ∞
with C ∞

∂K(K, E) (forgetting the ﬁrst component).

∂K(K, E) to be identiﬁed

Lemma 6.5 If γ : [0, 1] → L(G) = C ∞
∂K(K, E) is a continuous curve and
η : [0, 1] → G a C 1-curve5 with η(0) = idK, then η = Evolr(γ) if and only if
η is the ﬂow of the time-dependent vector ﬁeld γ for initial time t0 = 0, i.e.,

∂
∂t

and η(0)(x) = x.

(η(t)(x)) = γ(t)(η(t)(x))

for all t ∈ [0, 1]

Proof. For each ψ ∈ Diﬀ ∂K(K), the right translation

rψ : C ∞(K, E) → C ∞(K, E),

ζ 7→ ζ ◦ ψ

is a continuous linear map (by smoothness of Γ in Lemma 4.1), entailing that

T (rψ)(ζ, θ) = (rψ(ζ), rψ(θ))

for all ζ, θ ∈ C ∞(K, E). As a consequence, the tangent map of the restriction

ρψ : Diﬀ∂K(K) → Diﬀ∂K(K),

ξ 7→ ξ ◦ ψ

to the submanifold Diﬀ∂K(K) is given by

T ρψ(ξ, θ) = (ρψ(ξ), rψ(θ)) = (ξ ◦ ψ, θ ◦ ψ)

for all ξ ∈ Diﬀ∂K(K) and θ ∈ C ∞
in the lemma, then η = Evolr(γ) if and only if

∂K(K, E). Hence, if γ and η are as described

η′(t) = γ(t) ◦ η(t)

(20)

for all t ∈ [0, 1], where η′(t) ∈ C ∞
∂K(K, E) ⊆ C ∞(K, E) is the derivative of
η as a map to the locally convex space C ∞(K, E). Applying the continuous

5Since G is a submanifold, this is simply a C1-curve to C∞(K, E) with image in G.

25

linear point evaluations εx : C ∞(K, E) → E, ζ 7→ ζ(x) for x ∈ K, which
separate points on C ∞(K, E), we see that (20) is equivalent to

∂
∂t

(η(t)(x)) = γ(t)(η(t)(x))

for all x ∈ K, i.e., t 7→ η(t)(x) is the solution yγ,x of the initial value problem
y′(t) = γ(t)(y(t)), y(0) = x.
✷

Proposition 6.6 The Lie group Diﬀ ∂K(K) is C 0-regular, for each compact
convex subset K ⊆ Rn with non-empty interior.

Proof. Let E := Rn. Let Q and φ : Q × K → C 1([0, 1], E) be as in
Lemma 6.4. Since φ is smooth,

bφ : (Q × K) × [0, 1] → E,

(γ, x, t) 7→ φ(γ, x)(t)

is C ∞,1 (see [2, Theorem 3.28 (a)]) and thus C ∞,∞,1 as a map on the threefold
product Q × K × [0, 1] (see [1, Lemma 81]). Therefore

ψ : Q × [0, 1] × K → E, ψ(γ, t, x) := bφ(γ, x, t)

is C ∞,1,∞ and thus

ψ∨ : Q × [0, 1] → C ∞(K, E), ψ∨(γ, t)(x) := ψ(γ, t, x)

is C ∞,1 (see [1, Theorem 94]). We have ψ∨(γ, t)(x) = φ(γ, x)(t) = yγ,x(t)
for all γ ∈ Q, x ∈ K and t ∈ [0, 1], whence ψ∨(γ, t)(x) = x whenever
x ∈ ∂K. We can therefore consider ψ∨ as a continuous map to the aﬃne
vector subspace idK +C ∞
∂K(K, E), in which Diﬀ ∂K(K) is a neighbourhood of
idK. Since ψ∨(0, t)(x) = y0,x(t) = x, we have ψ∨(0, t) = idK for all t ∈ [0, 1].
Using the Wallace Lemma [17, 5.12], we ﬁnd an open 0-neighbourhood P ⊆ Q
such that

ψ∨(P × [0, 1]) ⊆ Diﬀ∂K(K).

For ﬁxed γ ∈ P , the map ψ∨(γ, •) : [0, 1] → Diﬀ∂K(K) is C 1 and ψ∨(γ, t)(x) =
yγ,x(t) for all x ∈ K and t ∈ [0, 1], whence

ψ∨(γ, •) = Evolr(γ)

26

by Lemma 6.5. Thus Evolr : P → C 1([0, 1], G) exists. If we can show that

evolr : P → G,

evolr(γ) := Evolr(γ)(1)

(21)

is smooth, then G will be C 0-regular by [24, Lemma 9.5]. Since G =
Diﬀ∂K(K) is a smooth submanifold of C ∞(K, E), the map evolr from (21)
will be smooth as a map to G if we can show that it is smooth as a map to
C ∞(K, E). Now, because ψ∨ is C ∞,1, the map

g := (ψ∨)∨ : Q → C 1([0, 1], C ∞(K, E)), g(γ)(t) := (ψ∨)(γ, t)

is C ∞ by [2, Theorem 3.25 (a)].
Using that the point evaluation
ε1 : C 1([0, 1], C ∞(K, E)) → C ∞(K, E), ζ 7→ ζ(1) is continuous linear and
hence smooth, we deduce that also

ε1 ◦ g : Q → C ∞(K, E),

γ 7→ g(γ)(1)

is smooth. But g(γ)(1)(x) = ψ∨(γ, 1)(x) = Evolr(γ)(1)(x) = evolr(γ)(x) for
all x ∈ K and thus g(γ)(1) = evolr(γ) for all γ ∈ P . Thus evolr |P is C ∞. ✷

7 Consequences for initial value problems on

compact convex sets

We start with some preparatory considerations.

Let E := Rn, K ⊆ E be a compact convex set with non-empty interior,
J ⊆ R be a non-degenerate interval, t0 ∈ J and f : J × K → E be a C 0,∞-
map such that f (t, x) = 0 for all t ∈ J and x ∈ ∂K.

7.1 For each compact subinterval C ⊆ J, we have that

sup
t∈C

Lip(f (t, •)) = sup
t∈C

q(f ∨(t)) < ∞,

with q as in (14). Hence f satisﬁes a local Lipschitz condition and hence
solutions to y′(t) = f (t, y(t)), y(t0) = x0 are unique on their interval of
deﬁnition (if they exist), for all t0 ∈ J and x0 ∈ K. As a consequence, there
is a unique maximal solution yt0,x0 : Jt0,x0 → K to the preceding initial value
problem, such that all other solutions are restrictions of yt0,x0 to subintervals
of Jt0,y0.

27

7.2 For ﬁxed t0, t ∈ J, the map

g : [0, 1] × K → E,

(τ, x) 7→ (t − t0)f (t0 + τ (t − t0), x)

is C 0,∞ and hence g∨ : [0, 1] → C ∞
∂K(K, E) ⊆ C ∞(K, E) is continuous by [2,
Theorem 3.25 (a)]. Thus Evolr(g∨) : [0, 1] → Diﬀ∂K(K) is C 1 and we know
that, for x0 ∈ K,

[0, 1] → K, τ 7→ Evolr(g∨)(τ )(x0)

is the solution to y′(τ ) = g(τ, y(τ )), y(0) = x0. If t − t0 6= 0, using the Chain
Rule this implies that

s 7→ Evolr(g∨)(cid:18)s − t0

t − t0(cid:19) (x0)

(22)

(for s in the interval I between t0 and t) solves y′(s) = f (s, y(s)), y(t0) = x0.
Thus I is contained in the domain of deﬁnition Jt0,x0 of the maximal solution
yt0,x0 of the latter initial value problem, and yt0,x0(s) is given by (22) for all
s ∈ I. As t was arbitrary, we deduce that yt0,x0 is deﬁned on all of J. For
later use, let us take s := t in (22); we obtain

yt0,x0(t) = Evolr(g∨)(1)(x0) = evolr(g∨)(x0).

(23)

Proposition 7.3 Let J ⊆ R be a non-degenerate interval, K ⊆ Rn be a
compact convex set with non-empty interior and P ⊆ F be a locally convex
subset with dense interior in a locally convex space F . Let r, s ∈ N0 ∪ {∞}
and

f : P × J × K → Rn

be a C r,s,∞-map such that f (p, t, x) = 0 for all p ∈ P , t ∈ J and x ∈ ∂K.
Then the initial value problem

y′(t) = f (p, t, y(t)),

y(t0) = x0

has a unique solution yp,t0,x0 : J → K deﬁned on all of J, for all p ∈ P ,
t0 ∈ J, and x0 ∈ K. The associated ﬂow

Φ : P × (J × J) × K → K,

(p, t0, t, x0) 7→ yp,t0,x0(t)

is C r,s,∞.

28

Proof. The uniqueness assertion was settled in 7.1 and existence in 7.2. We
now use that the mapping h : P × (J × J) × [0, 1] × K → Rn,

h(p, t0, t, τ, x) := (t − t0)f (p, t0 + τ (t − t0), x)

is C r,s,0,∞, whence

h∨ : P × (J × J) × [0, 1] → C ∞(K, Rn),

h∨(p, t0, t, τ )(x) := h(p, t0, t, τ, x)

is C r,s,0, by [1, Theorem 94]. Then h∨ is also C r,s,0 as a map to the closed
vector subspace C ∞
∂K(K, Rn) of C ∞(K, Rn). Using [1, Theorem 94] again, we
see that

(h∨)∨ : P ×(J×J) → C([0, 1], C ∞

∂K(K, Rn)),

(h∨)∨(p, t0, t)(τ ) := h∨(p, t0, t, τ )

is C r,s. Hence also

g := evolr ◦(h∨)∨ : P × (J × J) → Diﬀ ∂K(K) ⊆ C ∞(K, Rn)

is C r,s, where evolr : C([0, 1], C ∞
map which is smooth by C 0-regularity of Diﬀ ∂K(K). Hence

∂K(K, Rn)) → Diﬀ∂K(K) is the right evolution

bg : P × (J × J) × K → K,

bg(p, t0, t, x0) := g(p, t0, t)(x0)

✷

established.

is C r,s,∞ (see [1, Theorem 96]). Since Φ = bg (cf. (23)), the proposition is

Theorem B is a special case: If f is C ∞ and thus C ∞,∞,∞ in the preceding
proposition, then Φ is C ∞,∞,∞ and hence C ∞ (by [1, Remark 79]).

8 The Lie group Diﬀ ﬂat(K)

Let K ⊆ E = Rn as before. For k ∈ N, let Pk(E) be the ﬁnite-dimensional
vector space of all homogeneous polynomials p : E → E of order k and

P≤k(E)0

∼=

kMj=1

Pj(E)

be the ﬁnite-dimensional vector space of all polynomial functions p : E → E
of degree ≤ k such that p(0) = 0. Then P1(E) = L(E) is the space of linear

29

endomorphisms of E. Given p, q ∈ P≤k(E)0, let p⋄k q be the kth order Taylor
j=1 hj with homogeneous polynomials

hj : E → E of order j, then p ⋄k q is given by the truncated composition

polynomial of p ◦ q. Thus, if p ◦ q =Pk2
kXj=1

p ⋄k q =

hj.

It is clear that the map ⋄k is smooth and that (P≤k(E)0, ⋄k) is a monoid with
idE as the neutral element and open unit group

P≤k(E)×

0 = GL(E) ×

kMj=2

Pj(E).

Also the inversion map is smooth as it takes p to the kth order Taylor
polynomial of p|−1
U at 0 (for some open 0-neighbourhood U ⊆ E), which
depends smoothly on p (e.g., by the Inverse Function Theorem with Parame-
ters in [11]). Thus P≤k(E)×
0 is a (ﬁnite-dimensional) smooth Lie group. Note
that each x0 ∈ ∂K is a ﬁxed point for each φ ∈ Diﬀ∂K(K), and the map

fx0,k : Diﬀ ∂K(K) → P≤k(E)×
0

which takes φ to the kth order Taylor polynomial of φ − x0 around x0 is a
smooth group homomorphism, for each k ∈ N. Let O : ∂K → N0 ∪ {∞} be
a function and

DiﬀO(K)

be the group of all φ ∈ Diﬀ ∂K(K) such that fx0,k(φ) = idE for all x0 ∈ ∂K
and all k ∈ N such that k ≤ O(x0) (if O(x0) = 0, then the condition is
vacuous). Then Diﬀ O(K) is a closed normal subgroup of Diﬀ ∂K(K). Taking
O(x0) := ∞ for each x0 ∈ ∂K, we obtain

Diﬀﬂat(K) := DiﬀO(K)

as a special case. Returning to general O, it is clear that

C ∞

O (K, E) := {η ∈ C ∞

∂K(K, E) : (∀x0 ∈ ∂K)(∀N0 ∋ k ≤ O(x0)) η(k)(x0) = 0}

is a closed vector subspace of C ∞

∂K(K, E).

30

Proposition 8.1 For each compact convex subset K ⊆ Rn =: E with non-
empty interior and each O : ∂K → N0 ∪ {∞}, the subgroup DiﬀO(K) is a
submanifold of Diﬀ∂K(K) modelled on C ∞
O (K, E) and hence a Lie group.
The Lie group Diﬀ O(K) is C 0-regular.

Proof. The chart Φ : Diﬀ∂K(K) → Ω ⊆ C ∞
DiﬀO(K) onto Ω∩C ∞
the closed vector subspace C ∞
P≤k(E)×
ment idE. Then the Lie subgroup DiﬀO(K) coincides with the equalizer

∂K(K, E), φ 7→ φ − idK takes
O (K, E), whence DiﬀO(K) is a submanifold modelled on
∂K(K, E). Let gx0,k : Diﬀ ∂K(K) →
0 be the trivial homomorphism taking each φ to the neutral ele-

O (K, E) of C ∞

{φ ∈ Diﬀ∂K(K) : (∀x0 ∈ ∂K)(∀N ∋ k ≤ O(x0)) fx0,k(φ) = gx0,k(φ)}

of the given pairs (fx0,k, gx0,k) of smooth homomorphisms of Lie groups.
Hence Diﬀ O(K) inherits the C 0-regularity from the ambient C 0-regular Lie
group Diﬀ ∂K(K), by [13, Theorem G].
✷

A Proof of a folklore lemma

Proof of Lemma 2.1. (a) If (xα, yα)α∈A is a net in graph(f ) which converges
to some (x, y) ∈ X × K, then the net of the yα = f (xα) converges to f (x), by
continuity of f . Since also yα → y and limits in Hausdorﬀ spaces are unique,
we obtain (x, y) = (x, f (x)) ∈ graph(f ).

(b) We show that if f is not continuous, then graph(f ) is not closed. Now,
if f is not continuous, then f fails to be continuous at some x ∈ X. Hence,
there is an open neighbourhood V ⊆ K of f (x) such that f −1(V ) is not a
neighbourhood of x in X. Thus U \f −1(V ) 6= ∅ for each neighbourhood U of x
in X. Pick xU ∈ U \f −1(V ). Since f (xU ) ∈ K \V and K \V is compact, there
is a convergent subnet (f (xU (α)))α∈A (indexed by some directed set (A, ≤)).
Let y ∈ K \ V be its limit. Then (xU (α), f (xU (α)))α∈A is a net in graph(f )
which converges to (x, y). We have y 6= f (x) (since y ∈ K \ V but f (x) ∈ V )
and hence (x, y) 6∈ graph(f ). Thus graph(f ) is not closed.
