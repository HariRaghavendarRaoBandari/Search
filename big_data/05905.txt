A Network Topology Dependent Upper Bound on the Number of Equilibria

of the Kuramoto Model

Tianran Chen1, Dhagash Mehta2 and Matthew Niemerg3

Abstract— We begin with formulating the station-
ary equations of the Kuramoto model as a system of
polynomial equations in a novel way. Then, based on
an algebraic geometric root count, we give a prescrip-
tion of computing an upper bound on the number of
equilibria of the Kuramoto model for the most general
case, i.e., deﬁned on an arbitrary graph and having
generic values of natural frequencies and inhomoge-
neous couplings. We demonstrate with computational
experiments utilizing the numerical polynomial homo-
topy continuation method that our bound is tight for
the number of complex equilibria for the Kuramoto
model in the most general case. We then discuss the
implications or our results in relation to ﬁnding all
the real equilibria of the Kuramoto model.

I. Introduction

The Kuramoto model [1]–[4] is a prototypical model for
studying many phenomena including the synchronization
power systems, neural networks, chemical oscillators,
particle coordinations, rhythmic applause, and so on.
The general Kuramoto model is given by the diﬀerential
equation:

dθi
dt

= ωi −

1
N

N

X

j=1

Ki,j sin(θi − θj), for i = 1, ..., N, (1)

where N is the number of oscillators, Ki,j is the cou-
pling strength between the i-th and j-th oscillators.
The matrix K = [Ki,j ] may also be viewed as the
adjacency matrix for the underlying weighted graph.
Ω = (ω1, . . . , ωN ) contains the natural frequencies of
the N oscillators. Of crucial
importance in studying
the phase space of this system of ordinary diﬀerential
equations are the equilibria which are values of θ1, . . . , θN
for which dθi
dt = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , N . The stability
analysis of the equilibria can reveal the behavior of the
dynamical system near the equilibria. One can also study
synchronization phenomenon of the Kuramoto model
with the knowledge of the equilibria of the model [5].
Interpreting as the special case [6] of the power ﬂow
equations the equilibria of the Kuramoto model provide

crucial information for planning and designing power
grids.

Since the equilibrium conditions are invariant under
transformations of the form θi → θi+α for all θi with any
ﬁxed α ∈ (−π, π], they possess inﬁnitely many solutions.
To remove this degree of freedom, we ﬁx θN = 0 and
remove the N -th equation dθN
dt = 0. Thus, we are left
with N − 1 nonlinear equations in N − 1 angles.
The problem of counting the number of equilibria of
the ﬁnite N Kuramoto model has been tackled for diﬀer-
ent graphs such as complete graphs [7], nearest-neighbor
coupling on one-dimensional lattice graphs [7]–[11] and
with long-range interactions [12], two-dimensional lat-
tice graphs [8], [13]–[17], and three-dimensional lattice
graphs [17]–[19]; and the homogeneous frequencies case
(also known as the power ﬂow equations for the lossless
power system) [20], in diﬀerent disguises.

For N = 3, the Kuramoto model on a complete
graph of 3 nodes was shown to have at most 6 equilibria
[21]–[23]. Several necessary and suﬃcient conditions for
equilibria to exist and other conjectures on the types of
equilibria for diﬀerent graphs are provided in [24]–[32]
though some of which were disproved by counterexam-
ples in [5].

It was also shown in Ref. [7] that even after ﬁxing
the trivial zero mode by setting θN = 0, there existed
inﬁnitely many equilibria (also called incoherent mani-
folds [33]). Surprisingly, such inﬁnite families of equilibria
were also shown to exist in the one-, two- and three-
dimensional lattice model with nearest neighbour inter-
action in [8], [15], [34], where it was demonstrated that
the number of inﬁnite families of equilibria exponentially
grows with N .

As a signiﬁcant leap forward from the recent studies
of the Kuramoto model and the closely related load
ﬂow equations (for power networks) from algebraic view
points by the authors [5], [35], in the present contribu-
tion, we establish an upper bound on the number of equi-
libria for (1) using a novel polynomial formulation of the
and the theory of Bernshtein-Kushnirenko-Khovanskii
(BKK) bound [36]–[38]. The advantage of this bound
over existing bounds is that it takes into consideration
of the sparsity of the connections in the underlying
network. We present strong numerical evidence that for
many Kuramoto models, the proposed bound is best
possible bound for the number of complex equilibria. In
§ II-A, we describe a novel polynomial formulation of
the equilibrium equations of the Kuramoto model. After

reviewing existing bounds on the number of equilibria in
§ II-B, we propose an upper bound on the number of
equilibria based on the theory of BKK bound in § II-C.
We compute this bound for the Kuramoto models deﬁned
on diﬀerent graphs. Employing the numerical polynomial
homotopy continuation method, we provide a strong
numerical evidence to demonstrate that this bound to be
tight in these cases. In IV, we discuss the implications of
our results and conclude.

II. Upper Bound on the Number of Equilibria

In this section we discuss a novel polynomial formula-
tion of the Kuramoto model and provide an upper bound
based on the theory of BKK bound.

A. Polynomial Formulations

In studying nonlinear systems of equations like the
equilibrium equations of (1), it is a common practice
to ﬁrst transform them into algebraic equations which
would allow the use of powerful tools from algebraic
geometry. Previously (e.g. , [5], [8], [16], [20], [39]), the
equilibrium conditions of Eqs. (1) were transformed into
a system of polynomial equations by ﬁrst using the
identities sin(θi − θj) = sin θi cos θj − sin θj cos θi and
:= cos θi for
then the substitution si
all i = 1, . . . , N − 1, as well as adding the constraint
equations s2
i −1 = 0, for all i = 1, . . . , N−1, to ﬁnally
obtain the following system of polynomial equations:

:= sin θi and ci

i +c2

for i = 1, . . . , N − 1.
In the present work, we adopt a diﬀerent transfor-
mation: using the trigonometric identity, sin(θi − θj) =
2I (eI(θi−θj )−e−I(θi−θj )) where I := √−1 is the imaginary
unit, the equilibrium equations of (1) becomes

1

ωi −

N

X

j=1

Ki,j
IN

(eIθie−Iθj − e−IθieIθj ) = 0.

(3)

To formulate the above system of equations as an alge-
braic system, we let

xi := eIθi

and

yi := e−Iθi,

(4)

for all i = 1, . . . , N − 1. With this substitution (3)
becomes an enlarged system of 2(N − 1) equations in
2(N − 1) variables

For example, with N = 3, the system becomes

K1,2
3I
K2,1
3I

(x1y2 − x2y1) +
(x2y1 − x1y2) +

K1,3
3I
K2,3
3I

(x1 − y1) − ω1 = 0
(x2 − y2) − ω2 = 0
x1y1 − 1 = 0
x2y2 − 1 = 0.

(6)

It can be readily veriﬁed that the equilibria of (1) (with
the translation symmetry removed) are in one-to-one
correspondence with the special solutions of the above
system (5) that satisfy the additional restriction that
|xi| = |yi| = 1 for i = 1, . . . , N − 1.
B. Existing Bounds

Via the transformations given in (2) or (5), the prob-
lem of counting equilibria of the Kuramoto model is
turned into a root counting problem for systems of
polynomial equations. A well known bound on the root
count of a system of polynomial equations is the Bézout
bound which is simply the product of the degrees of all
the equations. In the example shown in (6), since each of
the four equations is quadratic (degree 2), the highest
possible number of isolated solutions as given by the
Bézout bound is therefore 24 = 16. In general, the Bézout
bound for the system (5) is 22(N −1).

The Bézout bound is a basic result in intersection
theory [40]. Based on this theory, a more reﬁned root
count can be derived for the equilibrium equations for
(1). This was ﬁrst studied in Ref. [20] in which it was
shown to be the binomial coeﬃcient (cid:0)2(N −1)
N −1 (cid:1), which will
be referred to as the binomial bound.1

In this subsection, we brieﬂy review the Bernstein–
Khovanskii–Kushnirenko (BKK) bound [36]–[38] for the
number of isolated nonzero complex solutions which is
a reﬁnement of the Bézout bound that takes into con-
sideration the monomials that appear in the polynomial
system: Given a polynomial, each of its terms give rise to
an exponent vector. For instance, for the term x3y2z1, the
exponent vector is simply the vector whose entries are
the exponents of x, y and z, respectively, i.e., (3, 2, 1).
The choice of this ordering is inconsequential as long
as it is kept the same for each equation. The set of
all exponent vectors derived from the nonzero terms of
an polynomial equation is called the support of that
equation. For example, if we arrange the variables in
the order of (x1, y1, x2, y2), then the supports of the four
equations in (6) are

S1 = {(1, 0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0)}
S2 = {(0, 1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0)}
S3 = {(1, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0)}
S4 = {(0, 0, 1, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0)}.

1In Ref. [20], the system (1) was termed as a special case of
the power ﬂow equations. Later on, the same binomial bound was
proposed for the complete power ﬂow equations [41] (see [42] for an
alternative proof for this bound).

A convex set is a set of points in which the line segment
connecting any pair of points in the set also lie in that
set. The convex hull of a set is the minimal convex set
containing that set. For a polynomial, the convex hull
of its support is known as the Newton polytope of that
polynomial. In the study of convex polytopes, the mixed
volume of several polytopes is an important concept. In
the simplest case, the mixed volume of two line segments
on the plane is precisely the area of the parallelogram
spanned by translations of these two line segments. The
general deﬁnition is included in the Appendix. Bern-
stein’s Theorem [36] provides an upper bound for the
number solutions to a system of polynomial equations in
terms of mixed volume:

Theorem 1 (Bernshtein [36]): Given a system of n
polynomial equations in n variables, the number of iso-
lated complex solutions for which no variable is zero
is bounded above by the mixed volume of the Newton
polytopes of the equations.

This upper bound is known as the BKK bound, af-
ter a circle of closely related works by Bernstein[36],
Kushnirenko[37], and Khovanskii[38]. Recall that via the
change of variables given in (4), each (real) equilibrium of
(1) corresponds to a unique nonzero complex solution of
(5). Therefore the BKK bound given above provides an
upper bound to the number of isolated (real) equilibria.
A crucial fact is that the BKK bound is generically
exact: when the coeﬃcients in the polynomial system
are chosen at random, with probability one the number of
isolated complex solutions for which no variable is zero is
exactly the BKK bound. In the polynomial formulation
of the Kuramoto model given in (5), if certain relations
are imposed on the coeﬃcients (e.g., the coeﬃcients of
x1y2 and x2y1 in (6) must be the same) the generic ex-
actness still holds true with a mild additional condition:
Theorem 2: If there exists a choice of Ki,j’s and ωi’s
for which the number of nonzero complex solutions of (5)
is the BKK bound, then for almost all choices of complex
Ki,j’s and ωi, the number of nonzero complex solutions
of (5) will be the BKK bound.

In other words, among the systems (5) for all possible
choices of the Ki,j’s and ωi’s,
if the BKK bound is
attainable then it must also be generically exact. In
the following, we shall compute the BKK bound for the
polynomial system (5) induced by a number of graphs.
Then, the attainability and hence the generic exactness
of the BKK bound in each case is veriﬁed by solving the
system (5) for some speciﬁc chosen set of Ki,j’s and ωi’s.

III. Results

In this section, we provide results for the Kuramoto
model on diﬀerent graphs. We compare the BKK bound
for both formulations (2) and (5) with the help of
the computational packages HOM4PS-3.0 [43], [44] and
Bertini [45], [46]. We also compare the bounds with the
corresponding binomial bound.

To analyze how tight the above mentioned bounds
are we provide results from our numerical experiments
using the NPHC method. The NPHC method guarantees
that one will obtain all isolated complex solutions for a
system of polynomial equations by following the strategy
as brieﬂy explained below[47], [48]: to solve a system of
polynomial equations, one starts with an upper bound
on the number of complex solutions of the system. Then,
another system is created such that the system has ex-
actly the same number of complex solutions as the upper
bound, and it is easy to solve. Finally, each solution
of this new system is evolved over a single parameter
towards the system to be solved. The so-called gamma-
trick is employed to ensure to achive all the isolated
complex solutions of the system.

A. BKK for the Complete Graphs

The complete graph is a graph in which each node
is connected to all other nodes. Hence, this is the most
densely connected graph. We compare the Bézout bound,
binomial bound, the BKK bound for the traditional
polynomial formulation (2), the BKK bound for the
new formulation (5), and the actual number of complex
solutions (with 100 random samples for each graph) in
Table I.

B. BKK for the Path Graphs

Now we turn our attention to one of the most sparsely
connected graphs — path graph. In a path graph, the
i-th node for 1 < i < N − 1 is connected to two of its
neighbors: the (i − 1)-th node and the (i + 1)-th node
forming a path. The results are given in Table II.

C. BKK for the Ring Graphs

A ring graph is a graph in which each node is connected
only to its nearest neighbors, same as the path graph,
and the last node is connected to the ﬁrst node making
a closed loop. The results are in Table III.

D. BKK for Erdős-Rényi Random Graphs

The Erdős-Rényi model for random graphs was ini-
tially studied in [49]–[51]. There are two formulations of
the model, but we will use the convention given originally
by Gilbert, that is the existence of each edge is i.i.d. with
probability p. Such graphs are denoted as G(N, p) where
N is the number of vertices of the graph and p is the
probability that any edge exists.

We construct a random graph G(N, p) by initially
creating an N × N empty adjacency matrix, A. Then,
for each Ai,j where i > j, we test for the existence of
edge Ei,j with the given probability p and update Ai,j
and Aj,i accordingly.

Connectedness of a graph is necessary to have non-
trivial equilibria for the Kuramoto model. Since the
probability that a random graph G(N, p) is connected
increases if p > pc = ln(N )/N , we let p vary between pc
and 1. Testing for connectedness is done by computing

for equality with N .

For both formulations of the Kuramoto model, the
Bézout bound is always 22(N −1). For all the random
Erdős-Rényi connected graphs with N = 5 and 6 that
we tested, we found that the complex solution count of
the associated polynomial system under the Kuramoto
model using the formulation of (5) was the same as
the BKK bound. For N = 5 and 6, we calculated the
number of complex roots for 10 random instances of the
Kuramoto model using (2) and (5). Tables IV and V
compare the BKK root count of polynomial systems aris-
ing from the Kuramoto model associated to 10 instances
of random Erdős-Rényi connected graphs using the two
formulations.

IV. Discussion and Conclusion

In this article, we have translated the stationary equa-
tions of the Kuramoto model to the polynomial form in
a diﬀerent way than the traditional polynomial formu-
lation to utilize complex algebraic geometry results. We
have considered a general form of the Kuramoto model,
i. e. , with arbitrary natural frequencies and on graphs
with arbitrary weights. We then provide a prescription to
compute a tight upper bound, called the BKK bound, on
the number of equilibria of the model for a given graph
topology, i.e., the bound captures the graph topology
accurately.

We ﬁrst reproduced the previously available upper
bound, (cid:0)2(N −1)
N −1 (cid:1), by computing the BKK bound for
the complete graph with arbitrary (and inhomogeneous)

coupling strengths and natural frequencies: the binomial
bound is the tightest possible bound for the Kuramoto
model on the complete graph. The previous upper bound,
however, does not take into account the sparsity of the
graphs unlike ours. For other sparser graphs such as path
graphs, ring graphs and Erdős-Rényi random graphs,
the BKK bound for the new polynomial formulation is
signiﬁcantly lower than the binomial bound as well as the
BKK bound for the traditional polynomial formulation.
Furthermore, with extensive numerical experiments
with the NPHC method, which guarantees to ﬁnd all
isolated complex solutions of systems of polynomial equa-
tions, we ﬁnd that for generic natural frequencies and
weights the number of complex solutions is always equal
to the BKK bound of the new polynomial formulation.
Hence, this is the best possible upper bound on the
number of complex solutions for generic values of natural
frequencies and inhomogeneous couplings.

Our prescription is also constructive in solving the
stationary equations of the model in that we not only
provide the tight-most upper bound but also the opti-
mum way of constructing a starting system for the NPHC
method. Because our numerical experiments suggest that
the BKK bound is always equal to the number of complex
solutions for generic parameter values, no path diverges
in the NPHC computation.

This tight upper bound not only helps the NPHC
method to solve the correpsonding systems more eﬃ-
ciently, but it also provides a concrete stopping criterion
to other stochastic nonlinear equation solving method.
Our results also give rise to the following interesting

Comparision among different bounds on the number of equilibria and the actual number of complex solutions for

generic parameter-values for the Kuramoto model on the random graph of 6 nodes for 10 samples.

and mathematically challenging questions: can there be
some values of Ki,j’s and ωi’s so that the number of
real equilibria attains the BKK bound for the given
graph? If not, what is the maximum number of real
solutions a particular graph can have? Though there are
a few algebraic geometry based methods[52] have been
developed to answer such questions, they can not yet deal
with systems beyond simple ones. Moreover, it will also
be interesting to investigate how the number of complex
and real equilibria behave for non-generic values of the
couplings and frequencies. We plan to study all these
issues in future.

In the future, we plan to explore the advantages and
disadvantages of both polynomial formulations in terms
of the numerical stability, ease to implement, and so on.
Systems with sine and cosine of angles and diﬀerence of
angles are not unique to the Kuramoto model, and hence
such a comparative analysis can have far reaching impli-
cations. We also point out a remarkable parallel between
upper bounds for the equilibria of the Kuramoto model
and those for the equilibria of the complete power ﬂow
equations [53]–[55]. We plan to quantitatively establish
this similarity in the future.

Appendix

Given n convex polytopes Q1, . . . , Qn ⊂ Rn and pos-
itive real numbers λ1, . . . , λn Minkowski’s Theorem [48]
states that the n-dimensional volume of the Minkowski
sum λ1Q1 + ··· + λnQn, deﬁned as

{ λ1q1 + ··· + λnqn | qi ∈ Qi for i = 1, . . . , n }

is a homogeneous polynomial of degree n in the variables
λ1, . . . , λn. The coeﬃcient associated with the monomial
λ1 ··· λn in this polynomial is known as the mixed volume
of the polytopes Q1, . . . , Qn.
