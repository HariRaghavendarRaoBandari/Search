Abstract. In this paper, we study the behavior of categorical actions of a Lie
algebra g under the deformation of their spectra. We give conditions under
which the general point of a family of categorical actions of g carry an action
of a larger Lie algebra ˜g, which we call an unfurling of g. This is closely
related to the folding of Dynkin diagrams, but to avoid confusion, we think
it is better to use a diﬀerent term.

Our motivation for studying this topic is the diﬃculty of proving that
explicitly presented algebras and categories in the theory of higher represen-
tation theory have the “expected size.” Deformation is a powerful technique
for showing this because of the upper semicontinuity of dimension under
deformation. In particular, we’ll use this to show the non-degeneracy (in the
sense of Khovanov-Lauda) of the 2-quantum group U for an arbitrary Cartan
datum and any homogeneous choice of parameters.

1. Introduction

The categoriﬁcation of Lie algebras and their representations has proven to be a rich
and durable subject since its introduction roughly a decade ago. This theory produces
a 2-categoryU depending on the choice of a Cartan datum and a choice of parameters;
a representation of this 2-category is called a categorical Lie algebra action of the Kac-
Moody algebra g corresponding to the Cartan datum. Many interesting categories
carry a categorical Lie algebra action, though it must be admitted that most of the
interesting examples are for a Cartan datum of (aﬃne) type A.

However, since the 2-quantum group U was ﬁrst deﬁned by Khovanov-Lauda
[KL10] and Rouquier [Roua], it has been haunted by a serious problem: since it is
presented by generators and relations, it is hard to check that it is not smaller than
expected. Speciﬁcally, in [KL10], it’s proven that there is a surjective map from the
modiﬁed quantum group ˙U to the Grothendieck group of U and that the dimension
of 2-morphism spaces between 1-morphisms in U is bounded above by a variation
on Lusztig’s bilinear form on the modiﬁed quantum group ˙U.
If equality holds
in this bound, then ˙U is isomorphic to the Grothendieck group and we call the
corresponding categoriﬁcation non-degenerate.

As a general rule, proving non-degeneracy depends on constructing appropriate
representations where one can show that no unexpected relations exist between 2-
morphisms in U. This is done for sln in [KL10], using an action on the cohomology

of ﬂag varieties. The next major step was independent proofs by Kang-Kashiwara
[KK12] and the author [Weba] that the simple highest weight representations of g
possess categoriﬁcations which are non-degenerate in an appropriate sense; this is
suﬃcient to prove the non-degeneracy for ﬁnite type Cartan data.

This allowed signiﬁcant progress, but along with many other techniques (such as
connections to quiver varieties studied in [CKL13, Roub, Webb]), it has an unfortunate
defect. Recall that the open Tits cone of a Cartan datum is the elements in the orbit of
a dominant weight under the Weyl group; for example, if g is aﬃne, then the open
Tits cone is the set of set of weights which are not non-zero multiples of δ. This set
is convex and every weight of a highest or lowest weight integrable representation
lies inside the open Tits cone.
If the Cartan datum is of inﬁnite type, then no
information about a weight λ outside the open Tits cone is contained in any of these
representations, since the corresponding idempotent 1λ ∈ ˙U kills any integrable
highest or lowest weight representation.
Thus, if we are to understand non-degeneracy for weights outside the open Tits
cone, we must have access to representations which are not highest or lowest weight.
For our purposes, the most promising are those given by a tensor product of highest
and lowest weight representations (perhaps many of each type). A construction of
such categoriﬁcations was given in [Web15], but the non-degeneracy proof given
there is only valid for weights inside the Tits cone. Thus, to access these other
weights, we must give a new argument for the non-degeneracy of these tensor prod-
uct categoriﬁcations, which will then imply the non-degeneracy of U. In particular,
we prove that:

Theorem A (Theorem 4.10) Fix a ﬁeld k and consider any Cartan datum (I,h−,−i),
andchoiceofthepolynomials Qij(u, v) ∈ k[u, v] whichishomogeneous(inthesense
discussedinSection2.1). Theassociated2-quantumgroupU isnon-degenerate,and
theGrothendieckgroupofU is ˙U.

While an interesting theorem in its own right, the techniques introduced here to
prove this result have a signiﬁcance of their own. A simple, but underappreciated,
technique for proving these sort of non-degeneracy arguments is the upper semicon-
tinuity of dimension under deformation. Perhaps calling this “underappreciated” is
unfair, since it is certainly a well-known and much used trick, but at least this author
wishes he had exploited it more systematically earlier.

Thus, much of this paper will be dedicated to an exploration of the behavior of
categorical actions under deformation. Let R be the KLR algebra of the Cartan datum
(I,h−,−i) (deﬁned in Section 2.1). We wish to consider quotients of this algebra where
the dots (the elements usually denoted yk ∈ R) have a ﬁxed spectrum; of course, all
of these quotients can be packaged together into a completion ˆR. Most often, people
have studied representations where the elements yk act nilpotently (all gradeable

2

Ben Webster

ﬁnite dimensional representations have this property), but we can also have them act
with certain ﬁxed non-zero eigenvalues. Given a choice of spectrum for the dots, we
have an associated graph with vertex set ˜I, with its associated Cartan datum. There’s
a natural map ˜I → I, which one can informally think of as a “branched cover” of the
Cartan datum (I,h−,−i).
This is closely related to the phenomenon of folding of Dynkin diagrams, but
due to some technical diﬀerences, we think it would be misleading to use the term
“folding” here. Thus, we call ˜I an unfurling of I (and I a furling of ˜I). Note that
whereas I is not necessarily symmetric as a Cartan datum (i.e. it has roots of diﬀerent
lengths), ˜I is symmetric. To give the reader a sense of this operation, let us discuss
some examples:

• If I is simply-laced, then ˜I will be a topological cover of I, such as an A∞ graph
covering an n-cycle, or the trivial cover ˜I (cid:27) I × U.
• If I is not simply laced, we can arrange for ˜I to be given by a simply-laced
Cartan datum with an isomorphism g (cid:27) ˜gσ for some diagram automorphism
σ. Note, this means that I is the Langlands dual of what is usually called a
folding of ˜I for the automorphism σ.

At the moment, it is unclear to the author what, if any, is the relationship between this
work and that of McNamara [McN] and Elias [Eli] which also combine the ideas of
categoriﬁcation and folding. Obviously, this would be an interesting topic for future
consideration.

We always have a map of Lie algebras g ֒→ ˜g, and this map has a categorical

analogue:

Theorem B (Proposition 3.3, Theorem 3.4)

(1) Thecompletion ˆR isisomorphic tothe completion oftheKLRalgebra R for ˜I

withrespecttoitsgrading.

(2) Acategorical action of g satisfying certain spectral conditions corresponding

to ˜I alsocarriesanactionof ˜g.

This theorem is particularly useful when we have a family of categorical g-modules.
We will typically have a categorical action of a larger Lie algebra at the generic
point of the deformation, but this action will fail to exist at certain special points
where the spectrum drops in size. Explicitly, the operators for ˜g are deﬁned as the
images of idempotents acting on 1-morphisms inU; the formula for these idempotent
depends on dividing by certain expressions that the spectral conditions guarantee
are invertible. At points where these denominators vanish, the idempotents and thus
their images may no longer be well-deﬁned.

That is, we can take a categorical g-module C which does not have a ˜g-action, ﬁnd
a deformation ˜C where the generic point satisﬁes the spectral conditions, and then

exploit the categorical ˜g-action to prove the original categoriﬁcation C is not smaller

This is our strategy for studying the categoriﬁcations Xλ of tensor products of

We can then apply the categoriﬁcation result for this larger irreducible (from [KK12,
Weba]) to prove the non-degeneracy of Xλ and U.

2. Background

2.1. The KLR algebra. Throughout, we’ll ﬁx a ﬁnite set I, and a Cartan datum on
this set. We’ll consider the root lattice X, the free abelian group generated by the
simple roots αi for i ∈ I, and we let h−,−i denote the symmetric bilinear form on this
abelian group attached to the Cartan datum.
The coroot lattice X∨ is the free abelian group generated by the symbols α∨i . We
have a pairing of X∨ × X → Z such that α∨i (α j) := hαi,α ji
. The matrix of this form
hαi,αii
is the Cartan matrix C = (cij = α∨i (α j)). Note that di = hαi, αii/2 are symmetrizing
coeﬃcients for this Cartan matrix: dicij = d jc ji = hαi, α ji for all i, j. For our purposes
a weight is an element of the dual lattice to X∨, so the pairing above lets us consider
each element of the root lattice as a weight2. Given a weight λ, we let λi = α∨i (λ).

Fix an algebraically closed ﬁeld k of characteristic coprime to all di, and choose
polynomials Pij(u, v) such that the product Qij(u, v) = Pij(u, v)P ji(v, u) is homogeneous
of degree −hαi, α ji = −2dicij = −2d jc ji when u is given degree 2di and v degree 2d j. Let
pij = Pij(1, 0). Let gij = gcd(−cij,−c ji) and hij = −cij/gij. We must have that

Pij(u, v) = pij Ya(k)

Homogeneity requires that Pij(x1/hi j, 1) be a polynomial. We’ll also let Aij = {α(k)
ij }
be the roots of Pij(x1/hi j, 1), again considered with multiplicity; note that the elements
of Aij are the dihijth roots of the elements of Aij. Furthermore, we have that dihij =
d jh ji = lcm(di, d j). We also let Bij = {β(k)
ji )−1}. As before, the elements of Bij are
ij
the dihijth roots of the elements of Bij.

Fix a countable set Ui ⊂ k \ {0} for each i ∈ I; for each u ∈ Ui, we ﬁx a choice
of dith root, which we denote u1/di (there are di choices, since di is coprime to the
characteristic of k). Since Ui is countable, we can write it as a union of nested ﬁnite
sets U(N)
for N ∈ Z≥0 (this choice is purely for technical reasons, and nothing we do
will depend on it).

This is the coarsest completion where we require that the topological spectrum of

2.2. Valued graphs. We’ll follow the conventions of Lemay [Lem] in this section.
For simplicity, “graph” will always mean a graph without loops.

Deﬁnition 2.3 A relatively valued graph isanorientedgraphwithvertexset I with
a pair of rational numbers (ηe, νe) assigned to each edge such that there exist di ∈ Q
foreach i ∈ I suchthat diηe = d jνe for e : i → j.
Anabsolutely valued graph isanorientedgraphasabovewithachoiceofrational
numbers di foreachvertex i and me foreachedge e.

Each absolutely valued graph has an associated relatively valued graph with

ηe =

me
di

νe =

me

Ben Webster

for an edge e : i → j, and every relatively valued graph has this form. The values ηe
and νe will be integers if di and me are and lcm(di, d j) divides me for an edge e : i → j.
Note that relatively valued graphs have a natural notion of Langlands duality, given
by switching ηe and νe. We attach a Cartan matrix to each such graph without loops,
with cii = 2 and

cij = − Xe : i→j

ηe − Xe : j→i

νe = −

1

di Xe : i→j

me −

1

d j Xe : j→i

me.

Note that Langlands duality transposes this Cartan matrix.

Having chosen Pij(u, v) for each pair i, j ∈ I2, we can canonically associate an abso-
lutely valued graph with vertex set I where we add an edge i → j whenever Pij(u, v)
is non-constant. The values di are as before, and me = deg Pij(xdi, 0) = deg Pij(0, xdj).
In the associated relatively valued quiver, the values we add to this edge are
(deg Pij(x, 0), deg Pij(0, x)). The Cartan matrix of the result is our original Cartan
matrix C.

Given a graph homomorphism between two valued graphs, we can consider var-
ious forms of compatibility between the valuings on the two graphs. One notion
considered by Lemay [Lem] is a morphism of valued graphs: this is a homomor-
phism of graphs where the appropriate statistics (η∗, ν∗, m∗, d∗) are preserved; this is
too inﬂexible for our purposes. Instead, we’ll consider a set of maps which are more
analogous to topological covers.

Deﬁnition 2.4 Wecallamap f : X → Y ofrelativelyvaluedgraphsa furling ifgiven
any y, y′ ∈ Y, and x ∈ f −1(y), we have that each edge d : y → y′ and each edge
e : y′ → y,

νd = Xx′∈ f−1(y′) Xd′ : x→x′

f (d′)=d

νd′

ηe = Xx′∈ f−1(y′) Xe′ : x′→x

f (e′)=e

ηe′.

The notion of a furling is very closely related to a “folding,” but we won’t use
this term, since it usually applies to the Langlands dual of the operation above, and
implies the existence of a group action. We’ll call Y a furling of X and X an unfurling
of Y. A morphism of relatively valued graphs which is also a topological cover is a
furling.

Note that if X has an compatible absolute valued structure such that dx and me is
constant on the ﬁbers of f and these ﬁbers are ﬁnite, then for an edge e : y′ → y, we
have that

ηe = Xx′∈ f−1(y′)

νe = Xx∈ f−1(y)

Thus, we can choose an absolute valued structure on Y such that

dy =

dx

| f −1(y)|

me = P f (e′)=e me′

| f −1(y)| · | f −1(y′)|

.

As deﬁned here, dy and me may not be integers, but if Y is ﬁnite, then we can always
just multiply every dy and me by lcm(| f −1(y)|) to clear denominators.
One special case is of particular interest is when X is given the trivial valuation
dx = me = νe = ηe = 1 and is equipped with an admissible automorphism σ; recall
that we call an automorphism of a graph admissible if no edges connect two vertices
in the same orbit under the action. We let Y be the quotient graph X/σ and f : X → Y
the obvious projection map. In this case, we have

(2.2)

dy =

1

| f −1(y)|

me =

| f −1(e)|

| f −1(y)| · | f −1(y′)|

.

This is the Langlands dual of the “folding” discussed in [Lem, §1] (which is the more
common way of associating a Cartan matrix to a graph with automorphism).

Lemma 2.5 Givenafurling f : X → Y,foranyﬁxed y, y′ ∈ Y andx′ ∈ f −1(y′) wehave
that:

(cid:3)

We assume from now on for all valued graphs appearing that the matrix C is a gen-

eralized Cartan matrix (in particular, all oﬀ-diagonal entries are negative integers).

Deﬁnition 2.9 We call a choice of spectra Ui complete ifwhenever Qij(u, u′) = 0 for
u ∈ Ui,then u′ ∈ U j.
Note that if all a(k)

ij ’s are mth roots of unity for some m, then any ﬁnite choice of Ui’s
can be made complete by adding ﬁnitely many elements (for example, all products
of elements of Ui and mth roots of unity will suﬃce). Any countable choice of spectra
can be completed to a countable complete choice of spectra; we let V(0)

Proposition 2.10 If Ui isacompletechoiceofspectra,thenthemap ˜I → I isafurling

Proof. The unique edge e : i → i′ in I has preimages corresponding to each element
u ∈ Ui and each root of Pii′(u, x) as a polynomial in x. Thus the number of preimages
e′ is the degree of this polynomial in x, and each has νe′ = 1, so this agrees with

9

Unfurling Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras

νe = deg Pij(0, x). Similarly, if we consider the edge d : i′ → i, the edges are in bijection
with the roots of Pi′i(x, u), and ηd = deg Pi′i(x, 0). This completes the proof.

(cid:3)

The most important example is the so-called “geometric” parameters for the sym-
metric Cartan matrix for an oriented graph, where Pii′(u, v) = (u− v)#i→i′. In this case,
a(k)
= 1 for all k and (i, u) is connected to (i′, u′) by the same number of edges as i and
ii′
i′ if u = u′ and none otherwise. Thus, if we choose Ui = U for some ﬁxed set U ⊂ k,
this is a complete choice of spectra and ˜I = I × U with the obvious graph structure.
If I is simply laced, but not simply-connected, then we can obtain non-trivial covers
as ˜I. For example, if I in an n-cycle with its vertex set identiﬁed with Z/nZ with
edges i → i + 1. Fix some q ∈ k and choose Qi,i+1(u, v) = qu − v. If we ﬁx U0 ⊂ k to
be any subset closed under multiplication by qn, then we have a complete choice of
spectra with Ui = qiU0. The components of the graph ˜I correspond to the orbits of
multiplication by q; these will be cycles if q is a root of unity, or A∞ graphs if q is not.
On the other hand, if we have a nonsymmetric Cartan matrix, then we may ﬁnd a
more interesting result. If Q12(u, v) = u2 − v and d1 = 1, d2 = 2 (so g = sp4), then the
factorization shown earlier is that Q12(u, v) = (u + v1/2)(u − v1/2), and so a(1)
= 1 and
a(2)
= −1. Thus, the number of edges joining (1, x) to (2, y) is given by the number of
12
solutions to x = ±√y. Thus, every component of ˜I is a subgraph of an A3 formed by
(1, x) → (2, x2) ← (1,−x) (assuming 1 , −1).
More generally, let d = lcm(di)i∈I. Let Ui be the d/dith roots of unity; there are d/di
distinct roots of unity since d is coprime to the characteristic of k. Assume that each
a(k)
ij

is a dth root of unity for all i, j, k. For example, we can assume that

12

(2.5)

Qij(u, v) = ±(uhi j − vhji)gi j

in which case, Qij(xdi, 1) = ±(xdihi j − 1)gi j, so the multiset of a(k)
is given by the
dihij = d jh ji = lcm(di, d j) roots of unity each with multiplicity gij. Alternatively, we
have α(k)
ij

ij and b(k)

ij

= β(k)
ij

= 1 for any k.

We have that each u ∈ Ui is connected by c ji edges to elements of U j, given by the
h jith roots of α(k)
ij uhi j. If Qij is as in (2.5), then for each d/dihijth root of unity ξ, we
connect each hijth root of ξ in Ui to each h jith root of ξ in U j with gij edges (with
orientation depending on Pij). Let ζ be a primitive dth root of unity.

Proposition 2.11 Assuming a(k)
ij isa dth root ofunity forall i, j, k and Ui isthe d/dith
rootsofunity,themapσ : (i, u) 7→ (i, ζdiu) isanadmissibleautomorphismofthegraph
˜I; the map ˜I → I = ˜I/σ induces the relative valued structure on I associated to the
polynomials Pij.

Note that the absolute weighting of (2.2) is the symmetrization we have chosen for

our Cartan matrix divided by d, since | f −1(i)| = d/di.

3. Completed KLR algebras

3.1. An isomorphism of completed KLR algebras. In this section we’ll show how
the completions of KLR algebras for I we discussed earlier are related to the KLR
algebras of ˜I.

Let j = (j1 = (i1, u1), . . . , jn = (in, un)). By abstract Jordan decomposition, for any
element x ∈ ˆR and u ∈ k, there is unique idempotent e in the quotient ˆR/IN whose im-
age is the generalized u-eigenspace of x acting by left multiplication; by uniqueness,
these are compatible under the quotient maps, and thus give an idempotent in ˆR.
Performing this construction inductively, we can consider any commuting set of ele-
ments {x j} and construct an idempotent projecting to their simultaneous generalized
eigenspace in ˆR/IN for any choice of scalars {uj}.
Deﬁnition 3.1 Letǫj betheresultingidempotentwhereweperformthisconstruction
with ei havingeigenvalue 1 and y j eigenvalue uj forall j.

In particular, eiǫj = ǫjei = ǫj, and (y j − uj)ǫj is topologically nilpotent.
There is a unique dikth root of ykǫj such that (y

3.2. Application to categorical actions. We’ve considered the KLR algebra R with
an eye toward studying categorical actions of Lie algebras. By “a categorical action
of a Lie algebra” we mean a representation of a speciﬁc 2-category U deﬁned by
Khovanov-Lauda [KL10] and Rouquier [Roua]. We’ll follow the conventions of
[Weba, 2.4], where this 2-category is presented by taking the quotient of a 2-category

˜˜U of KL diagrams (see [Weba, 2.3]) by the KLR relations (2.1a–2.1g) and the following

powerful technique to deform these representations in such a way as to break this
assumption. Let k be a ﬁeld, and let C (cid:27) ⊕λCλ be a k-linear idempotent complete
category with a direct sum decomposition indexed by the weights for our Cartan
datum, with each Cλ Krull-Schmidt.
Fix sets Ui ⊂ k\{0}, with the graph ˜I constructed from the polynomials Pij as before.

y : Ei,u → Ei,u

ψ : Ei,uEi′,u′ → Ei′,u′ Ei,u

such that y is nilpotent and these transformations deﬁne an action of the algebra
Ei,u with ej being projection to the
corresponding summand. This structure is part of the deﬁnition of a categorical
action of ˜g, the symmetric Kac-Moody algebra attached to the graph ˜I.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): We have already discussed the existence of an appropriate Rn action,
based on Proposition 3.3.
By [Roub, 4.18], it suﬃces to check the sl2 relations hold. That is, the proof for
general g will follow from the result for g = sl2 and I = {i} a single dot. In this case, ˜I
is disconnected and ˜g (cid:27) sl⊕ℓ
Furthermore, by [Roua, 5.5], it suﬃces to consider the universal categoriﬁcation of
2 -module with highest weight (n1, . . . , nℓ); in fact, since y is nilpotent, we
the simple sl⊕ℓ
need only consider the universal categoriﬁcation where y is topologically nilpotent.
Consider the completion of the deformed cyclotomic quotient ˇR(n1,...,nℓ), the quotient
of R ⊗k

2 where ℓ = #Ui. We pick a bijection ˜I (cid:27) [1, ℓ]

k[[q1,1, . . . , q1,n1, . . . , qℓ,1, . . . , qℓ,nℓ]] by the relations

pm1(y1em) = 0

with

pm(u) := unm1 + qm1,1unm1−1 + ··· + qm1,nm1

.

This is Morita equivalent to the tensor product of analogous completions for the
points of ˜I: ˇRn1 ⊗···⊗ ˇRnℓ. The projective modules over ˇR(n1,...,nℓ) are universal amongst
categoriﬁcation where y is nilpotent.
Consider the quotient R[[q]]/p(y1) with p(w) = Qℓ
m w − 1). The map ν−1
induces a map of k[[q]]-algebras R[[q]] → ˇR(n1,...,nℓ). This map sends p(y1)em to
p(um(1 + y1))ǫm = p1(u−1
Thus, this induces a map R[[q]]/p(y1) → ˇR(n1,...,nℓ).
On the other hand, ν induces a map ˆR[[q]] → R[[q]]/p(y1) (since the spectrum of y

1 um − 1)··· pm(y1)··· pℓ(u−1

ℓ um − 1)ǫm = 0.

ℓ umy1 + u−1

1 umy1 + u−1

m=1 pm(u−1

in the latter quotient lies in U). This map sends

pm1(y1em) 7→ pm1((u−1

m1 y1 − 1)em) = p(y1) · Ym,m1

pm(u−1

m y1 − 1)−1em = 0.

Thus, we obtain an isomorphism R(n1,...,nℓ) (cid:27) ˆR[[q]]/p(y1). Thus, the action on R(n1,...,nℓ)
is induced by the action on R[[q]]/p(y1)-modules described in [Weba, 3.25].

(2) ⇒ (1): By assumption, the spectrum of y on Ei is contained in Ui. Thus, the
action of Rn on En extends to an action of ˆRn, and thus of Rn by Proposition 3.3. As in
the proof the other direction, it’s enough to check that each Ei,u, Fi,u give a categorical
sl2-action, and thus enough to consider g = sl2. Consider an indecomposable object
B which is highest weight for Ei; the category generated by B under the action of sl2
is equivalent to ˇRn ⊗ ˇRn
End(B) by [Weba, 3.25]. By replacing this subcategory with
its module category, we can assume that B is simple. In this case, the subcategory
additively generated by categoriﬁcation functors acting on B is equivalent to ˇR/p(y1)
for some polynomial p(u) ∈ K[u] with coeﬃcients given by the action of the fake
clockwise bubbles. By (3.5), this polynomial must be p(w) = Qℓ
m=1(w − um)nm where
nm = α∨(i,m)(λ). As argued before, ˇR/p(y1) (cid:27) R(n1,...,nm), so we obtain the desired sl⊕ℓ

action.

Now, for a ﬁxed object B (no longer assumed to be highest weight), we wish to
establish the result for the subcategory generated by B under the g categoriﬁcation

15

Unfurling Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras

functors. We establish this by induction on the smallest integer p such that Ep
i B = 0. If
this is the case for p = 1, then we are back in the highest weight object case. Otherwise,
induction shows that the object EiB generates a subcategory C′ where the map ρ(i,m),λ
induces an isomorphism. Thus, it suﬃces to check this natural transformation is an
isomorphism in the quotient category C/C′. In this quotient, B is highest weight, so
we are done. This establishes that we have the desired sl⊕ℓ
2 -action, which as argued
above gives the ˜g action.

(cid:3)

4. Deformed tensor product algebras

4.1. The deﬁnition. In [Web15, §5], we introduced a natural categoriﬁcations Xλ for
tensor products of highest and lowest weight representations. These categoriﬁcations
have natural deformations, which we wish to study in the context of the previous
section.

We will use the notation

+ba

i

to denote the endomorphism (y + b)a of Fi, and similarly for Ei.

In [Web15, §4], we introduced a notion of tricolore diagrams, which naturally form
the 2-morphisms of a 2-category T. The categoriﬁcations Xλ are natural subquotients
of this category, and our deformed categoriﬁcations arise from a straightforward
deformation of the relations from [Web15], which we present below:

Deﬁnition 4.1 LetT bethequotientof ˜˜T⊗k[z1, . . . , zℓ] bytherelations(2.1a–2.1g,3.3a–

the term Q ji(u)−1 contributes a j,u′ for each edge joining (i, u) to (j, u′) in ˜I. Thus, we

¯K (recall
that we will often exclude λ from the notation when it is unlikely to be confused),
we can thus decompose it according to the spectrum of the dots yk. For a sequence

yk − uk for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n.

¯K isgenerated

bythetricolore triple (∅, 0) asacategoricalmoduleover ˜g.
Proof. First, we note that if u ∈ Ui and u′ < U j, then Qij(y1, y2) acts on Ei,uE j,u′ with its
only eigenvalue Qij(u, u′) , 0 (by the deﬁnition of Ui). Thus the crossing ψ induces
an isomorphism Ei,uE j,u′ (cid:27) E j,u′ Ei,u. Similarly, F j,u′ commutes past all red and blue
strands since y − zk is invertible, with its only eigenvalue u′ − zk; in fact, this still
follows for the kth red/blue strand if u′ , zk (in particular, if k , m(u′)).
We establish the result by induction on ℓ and n (i.e. on the total number of strands).
If n = 0, the result is tautological. Otherwise, the rightmost strand in the idempotent
If it is black, then (i, κ) = Ei(i−, κ)
for the object (i, κ) is either black, blue or red.
for some i ∈ ±I, and decomposing with respect to the eigenvalues of y, we have
Ei(i−, κ) (cid:27) ⊕Ei,u(i−, κ) where u ranges over the roots of the minimal polynomial of y
acting on Ei(i−, κ). By induction (i−, κ) is a sum of modules obtained from (∅, 0) by the
functors E j,u′ and F j,u′ for u′ ∈ U j. If u is not in Ui, then all these functors commute with
Ei,u (as argued above), and Ei,u(∅, 0) = 0, so Ei,u(i−, κ) = 0, and Fi(i−, κ) (cid:27) ⊕u∈Ui
Ei,u(i−, κ).
By induction, this establishes the result.

On the other hand, if the rightmost strand is blue or red, we simply apply induction
with the tricolore triple (λ−, i, κ−) with this strand removed. By induction, (λ−, i, κ−) (cid:27)
⊕(λ−, i, κ−)u with k > κ(m(uk)) and m(uk) < ℓ. Since adding in the ℓth blue or red strand
does not change the eigenvalues of the dots, we also have (λ, i, κ) (cid:27) ⊕(λ, i, κ)u with u
ranging over the same set. This shows equation (4.3), and that U′i

= Ui.

Thus X

¯K is generated by a single object, which is highest weight for the compo-
nents of ˜I with λm(u) dominant and lowest weight for those with λm(u) anti-dominant.
Alternatively, we can easily choose a Borel for which this representation is straight-
forwardly highest weight. To distinguish objects which are highest weight for this
Borel, we call them signed highest weight. Since ˜I is split into components in bi-
jection with [1, m], we can write each weight ˜λ uniquely as a sum ˜λ = ˜λ1 + ··· + ˜λm
where ˜λm is supported on the component with m(u) = m.
We can apply the classiﬁcation of highest weight representations in [Weba, 3.25],
which shows that any idempotent complete representation additively generated by
a highest weight object is equivalent to the projective modules over a base change of
the deformed cyclotomic quotient ˇR ˜λ for ˜g of highest weight ˜λ. This base change is by
the endomorphism ring of the highest weight object over the ring ˇR ˜λ
, the polynomial
˜λ
ring on fake bubbles in weight ˜λ.

We can justify the change of Borel by applying the Cartan involution in the factors
where λm(u) is anti-dominant, which is essentially relabeling Fi,u as Ei,u instead. The
ring ˇR ˜λ is Morita equivalent to the tensor product ˇR ˜λ1 ⊗···⊗ ˇR ˜λℓ. The diﬀerent choice
of Borel means that it is more convenient to think of deformed cyclotomic quotient
ˇR ˜λk as written with a red strand and downward black strands if λk is dominant, and
with a blue strand and upward black strands if λk is anti-dominant.

End(∅, 0) to the endomorphisms of the signed highest weight object. Since y : Fi,u →
Fi,u is nilpotent and the endomorphisms of End(∅, 0) are just the scalars, this resulting
base change is simply the tensor product of undeformed cyclotomic quotients X ˜λ ⊗k
¯K (cid:27) X ˜λ1 ⊗X ˜λ2⊗···⊗X ˜λℓ ⊗k
¯K. Thus, we have an induced strongly equivariant functor

λ

¯K is a trivial category.

Since this functor is strongly equivariant, and both source and target are generated
by a signed highest weight object with only scalar endomorphisms, this functor
is either an equivalence or X
¯K satisﬁes any
hypotheses that X ˜λ ⊗k
¯K does. For example, each weight space is equivalent to the
category of projective modules over a ﬁnite dimensional ¯K-algebra.
It will actually be more convenient for us to think of the irreducible module with
signed highest weight ˜λ as a tensor product of simples corresponding to the diﬀerent
components. That is, we use the equivalence of X ˜λ with the tensor product category
X ˜λ where ˜λ = ( ˜λ1, ˜λ2, . . . , ˜λℓ). We can deﬁne a functor

which sends (i, κ) to the sumL(j, κ) where j ranges over sequences with jk = (ik, uk).

If j satisﬁes k > κ(m(uk)), then we have (j, κ) (cid:27) (j, 0), and otherwise the corresponding

object is 0, so Lemma 4.6 shows that this is quasi-inverse to Φ on the level of 1-
morphisms.

Now, we must deﬁne how Ξ acts on 2-morphisms. First, note that by Theorem 3.4,
we have a categorical action of g on X ˜λ ⊗k
¯K. On purely black diagrams, Ξ simply
employs this action; that is, on upward oriented diagrams, it follows the formula
(3.2). Since left (or right) adjunctions are unique up to isomorphism, we can send the
leftward cup and cap in Ug to any adjunction we choose. For simplicity, we simply
match leftward oriented cups and caps as below:

For rightward oriented cups, the formula is quite complicated, but is ﬁxed by the
choices we have made thus far, and the existence of a consistent choice follows from
the existence of the g-action. Thus, we need only show this action on diagrams with
red/blue strands, with formulas given below (4.6–4.7).

Proof. In order to check this, we have to verify all the relations on 2-morphisms.
The equations that can be stated purely using upward or down diagrams, that is,
(2.1a–2.1g, 4.1b, 4.1f–4.1d) all follow by straightforward calculations as in the proof
of Proposition 3.3.

Thus we only need to argue for the relations involving right cups and caps. The
way we have deﬁned the right cup/cap means that relations (3.3a–3.3g) are automatic.
The remaining relations (4.1e, 4.1a) are actually redundant when the right cap and
cup are deﬁned in terms of the left cup and cap. The relation (4.1e) is the deﬁnition
of the upward red/black or downward blue/black crossings, in this perspective. For
the relation (4.1a), assume we are considering the red version; the blue one follows
similarly. We must consider two diﬀerent cases. Let µ be the label of the region at
the left of the picture.

• If µi ≥ 0, then we have we have make a loop at the left with µi dots. Pulling
this through and applying (4.1b), then undoing this bubble, we obtain the
desired relation.

• if µi ≤ 0, then we start with the diagram with a leftward cup at the bottom
and rightward cup at top, and compare the result of applying [Web15, 3.6d]
to these two strands to the left and right of the red strand. Using the relations
(4.1d,4.1g), we can move the bigon to the right side of the red line, and using
(4.1b) to remove bigons between red and downward strands. The left- and
right-hand sides now have the same pattern of black strands, but in one the
upward strands make a bigon with the red strand and in the other, they don’t.
This can only hold if (4.1a) is true.

λ

¯K is equivalent to X ˜λ ⊗k

¯K via the functor Φ deﬁned in

Proof. By [Weba, 3.25], this functor is an equivalence if End(∅, 0) (cid:27) k. Thus, the only
issue is that the object (∅, 0) might simply 0 (in which case the entire category X
¯K is
0).

λ

λ

The functor Ξ sends (∅, 0) to (∅, 0). The existence of this functor establishes that
¯K is not 0, so Φ must be an equivalence.
In fact, we can easily see that Ξ is
X
strongly equivariant for ˜g, so it must be quasi-inverse to Ξ when composed with the
equivalence X ˜λ ⊗k
(cid:3)
4.3. Applications. Now, we turn to the application of our results, culminating in the
proof of Theorem A.

¯K (cid:27) X ˜λ ⊗k

¯K.

Theorem 4.9 For two tricolore triples (λ, i, κ) and (λ, i′, κ′), the set D is a basis over

C[z] forthemorphismspace HOMT(cid:16)(λ, i, κ), (λ, i′, κ′)(cid:17).

Proof. The proof that these are a spanning set is essentially equivalent to that of [KL10,
Prop. 3.11]. First, note that any two minimal diagrams for the same matching are
equivalent modulo those with fewer crossings (using the relations (2.1f, 2.1g, 4.1f,
4.1g)). Similarly, moving dots to the chosen positions only introduces diagrams with
fewer crossings.

Thus, we only need show that all minimal diagrams span. Of course, if a diagram
is non-minimal then it can be rewritten in terms of the relations in terms of ones with
fewer crossings, using the relations to clear all strands out from a bigon, and then
the relations (2.1e, 3.3e–3.3f, 3.3g, 4.1b) to remove it. Thus, by induction, this process
must terminate at a expression in terms of minimal diagrams. Thus, these elements
span, and it suﬃces to show that these elements are linearly independent when z are
generic, that is, after base change to ¯K.

Assume L = µ. We consider how the elements in D act on the quadruple with

i = ∅ in the deformed category Xλ with λ chosen so thatP λi = µ.

It suﬃces to check that these elements act linearly independently on X

¯K for some
λ; in the course of the proof we’ll modify λ as necessary to achieve this. Note the

λ

Unfurling Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras

enormous advantage obtained by having both dominant and anti-dominant weights,
as we can add cancelling pairs of these without changing the total sum.

As in [Weba, 4.17], we can compose with the diagram ηκ pulling all black strands
to the left and ˙ηκ, its vertical reﬂection3. This will send a non-trivial relation between
the diagrams in D to a non-trivial relation between diagrams where κ(i) = n for all i.
We can now project this relation to the subspace where we ﬁx the eigenvalue of
each dot acting at the top and bottom. The formulas (3.2, 4.5–4.7) deﬁning the functor
Ξ show that this projection is the image under Φ of a diagram with an equal or smaller
number of crossings, and we can only have equality if we choose eigenvalues so that
they coincide at opposite ends of a strand. Now, ﬁx a matching D such that an
associated basis vector appears in our relation, and the corresponding diagram has
a maximal number of crossings among those that appear.

We can adjust our weights in the list λ so that they include weights λa in bijection
with the matching pairs in D (which correspond to arcs in the diagram), with λa
dominant if the corresponding arc a is downward oriented at its lefthand edge and
λa anti-dominant if the arc a is upward oriented at its lefthand edge. Now, let us take
the projection to the subspace where the eigenvalue of the dot at each end of the arc
a is the variable za. Let j and j′ be the associated sequences in ˜I at the bottom and top
of the diagram.

Note that D gives the only way of matching the terminals in j and j′ to produce a
legal tricolore diagram. Thus all diagrams in our relation that give a diﬀerent match-
ing from D project to 0, since there is no matching which has the same eigenvalue at
both ends of each strand and fewer crossings than D.

Therefore, this must be the projection of a relation in X

¯K where all terms have
the underlying matching D with some number da of dots on the arc a, times some
monomial M in the bubbles at the left of the diagram.
If we show that no such
relation exists, then for each choice of da and M, the corresponding term must have
had coeﬃcient 0 in the original relation. It follows that the original relation must
have been trivial.

λ

First, we consider bubbles. Any bubble at the left of the diagram evaluates to
a scalar, using the relations (4.1a) and (4.1b). The clockwise bubbles with label i
evaluate to the coeﬃcients of the power series Qi(u − zk)λi
k and counterclockwise
bubbles to the coeﬃcients of its formal inverseQi(u − zk)−λi
k. By adding new pairs of
red and blue strands with labels ν and −ν for a strictly dominant weight ν, we can
assure that any ﬁnite set of monomials in clockwise bubbles are sent to elements of
¯K which are algebraically independent over k.

Furthermore, we can explicitly describe the space HOMT(cid:16)(λ, j, κ), (λ, j′, κ′)(cid:17); it has
a basis over ¯K given diagrams with matching D and with da < |λia
a |. Thus, for any
ﬁnite number of ways of choosing da and M, we can choose λa’s so the corresponding

3We use η instead of θ here since we are pulling left rather than right.

diagrams lie in this basis. Since these diagrams remain linearly independent after
acting in X
¯K, they must be linearly independent, so we must have that the coeﬃcient
of this diagram in ¯K is 0. This in turn supplies a polynomial relation between the
values of the clockwise bubbles. We can rule out this possibility by choosing λ so
that the bubbles which appear in the relation are algebraically independent. Thus,
we see that the relation we chose is trivial. This establishes the linear independence
of our prospective basis and establishes the result.
(cid:3)

Since U has a natural functor to T just not using any red or blue strands, this

shows:

Theorem 4.10 The2-categoryU isnon-degenerateforanyﬁeld k andchoiceof Q∗,∗.
Inparticular,theGrothendieckgroup Kq(U) isisomorphicto ˙U.
Proof. The spanning set Bi,j,λ of Khovanov and Lauda is still linearly independent after
applying the functor to T , and thus must be linearly independent. This shows the
non-degeneracy, and the isomorphism of Grothendieck groups follows from [KL10,
1.2].
(cid:3)

Remark 4.11. If our goal was only to prove Theorem 4.10, we could have avoided some
of the diﬃculties of the proof above: as observed above, we can deﬁne a categorical
action of U on Xλ1 ⊗ X−λ2 which categoriﬁes the tensor product of a highest and
lowest weight simple, using Theorem 3.4. Note, however, that this requires y to not
be nilpotent, but to have at least two elements in its spectrum. This shows that the
map ˙U → K(U) must be injective, since no element of ˙U kills all highest tensor lowest
modules; we can also see that we get the correct inner product, since the Euler form
on Xλ1 ⊗ X−λ2 matches the tensor product of Shapovalov forms.
