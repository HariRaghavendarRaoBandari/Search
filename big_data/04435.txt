ABSTRACT

We present the discovery of a new satellite of asteroid (130) Elektra - S/2014 (130) 1 - in diﬀerential
imaging and in integral ﬁeld spectroscopy data over multiple epochs obtained with SPHERE/VLT.
This new (second) moonlet of Elektra is about 2 km across, on an eccentric orbit and about 500 km
away from the primary. For a comparative study, we also observed another triple asteroid system
(93) Minerva. For both systems, component-resolved reﬂectance spectra of the satellites and primary
were obtained simultaneously. No signiﬁcant spectral diﬀerence was observed between the satellites
and the primary for either triple system. We ﬁnd that the moonlets in both systems are more likely
to have been created by sub-disruptive impacts as opposed to having been captured.

INTRODUCTION

Asteroids are the relics of the building blocks that
formed the terrestrial planets in the early days of the
Solar System. Asteroids with satellites are of particu-
lar importance because their formation mechanisms, ac-
cretional and collisional processes, are critical in planet
formation and evolution.
In addition, multiple aster-
oids provide otherwise unattainable information about
the intrinsic properties of the system: composition, in-
terior structure and evolutionary processes (Margot et
al. 2015). Recently, a second-generation extreme-AO in-
strument, Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet
Research instrument (SPHERE; Beuzit et al. 2008), has
been commissioned at one of European Southern Ob-
servatory’s 8 m Very Large Telescopes (VLT) at Cerro
Paranal in Chile. SPHERE, with its unprecedented sen-
sitivity and spatial resolution, oﬀers a fresh opportunity
for detecting and characterizing multiple asteroid sys-
tems.

More than a hundred binary or triple asteroids have
been detected. However, how and under what conditions
these systems formed is poorly understood. Component-
resolved spectroscopy of the primary and the moonlet ob-
tained simultaneously is the key to understanding their
formation. If the moonlets resulted from an impact, then
they would be of the same composition as the primary.
Whereas, if the multiple system originated from capture
during a three-body encounter, then the composition of
the satellites would diﬀer from that of the primary. Most
of the available component-resolved spectroscopic studies
ﬁnd no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the primary and
secondary, for example (22) Kalliope (Laver et al. 2009),
(90) Antiope (Marchis et al. 2011), (379) Huenna (De-
Meo et al. 2011) and (809) Lundia (Birlan et al. 2014).
However, a recent work on two triple asteroid systems,

byang@eso.org

(45) Eugenia and (87) Sylvia, yield rather surprising
results. Using SINFONI/VLT, Marchis et al. (2013a)
found that the spectra of the moonlets are noticeably
redder than their primaries. The diﬀerence in the spec-
tral slopes of the individual components for Eugenia and
Sylvia is not well understood. One possible explanation
is that the primary and the satellites may have experi-
enced diﬀerent surface alteration processes (such as space
weathering eﬀects; see Lantz et al. 2013) due to the dif-
ference in their dynamical ages. Alternatively, satellites
may not result from impact but originate, instead, from
a capture during a three-body encounter (Funato et al.
2004). To investigate these possibilities, we performed
direct imaging and integral ﬁeld spectroscopy of two mul-
tiple asteroids (i.e. (93) Minerva and (130) Elektra) using
SPHERE.

(93) Minerva is the ﬁfth triple asteroid discovered in
the Main Belt (Marchis et al. 2009). The primary, lo-
cated in the mid asteroid belt (r=2.75 AU), is a large
and dark asteroid (D = 147±2 km, pv = 0.068 ± 0.003,
Usui et al. 2011) and its spectrum is classiﬁed as a C-type
(Lazzaro et al. 2004; DeMeo et al. 2009). (130) Elektra
was one of the four binary systems with eccentric mu-
tual orbits (Marchis et al. 2008b). The primary is also a
large and dark main belt asteroid (D = 197±20 km, pv
= 0.064 ± 0.013, Marchis et al. 2012). Its optical spec-
trum is classiﬁed as a G or Ch-type (Tholen & Barucci
1989; Bus & Binzel 2002). Both Minerva and Elektra
are low-albedo primitive asteroids, as are Eugenia and
Sylvia. If the space weathering eﬀect is responsible for
the spectral diﬀerence between the primary and the two
satellites seen in the Eugenia and Sylvia systems, the
same process may have also modiﬁed the surface proper-
ties of the Minerva and Elektra systems. If so, we would
expect the spectra of the moonlets to be diﬀerent from
those of the primaries.

2. OBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION

Observations were carried out with the two infrared
i.e. the
subsystems of SPHERE/VLT simultaneously,
infrared diﬀerential
imager and spectrograph (IRDIS;
Dohlen et al. 2008) and the integral ﬁeld spectrograph
(IFS; Claudi et al. 2008). Low resolution spectra were
obtained with the IFS from 0.95-1.65 µm (Y to H-band,
spectral resolution ∼30), while simultaneous images were
obtained in two narrow (∆λ = 0.1 µm) bands K1 and
K2 (λ=2.11 µm and 2.25 µm) with IRDIS. For (130)
Elektra, we observed in the ﬁeld stabilized mode, where
the sky remains ﬁxed with respect to the detector. (93)
Minerva was observed in the pupil-tracking mode (Liu
2004; Marois et al. 2006), where the sky rotates, but
the pupil stays ﬁxed with respect to the detector. The
ﬁelds of view (FOV) of IRDIS and IFS are 11(cid:48)(cid:48)×12.5(cid:48)(cid:48) and
1.73(cid:48)(cid:48)×1.73(cid:48)(cid:48) respectively, while the pixel scale is 0.0123(cid:48)(cid:48)
for both.

We used the SPHERE consortium’s pipeline (Pavlov
et al. 2008) for data reduction. See Mesa et al. (2015)
and Vigan et al. (2015) for further details. IRDIS im-
ages were dark subtracted, ﬂat ﬁelded and bad pixels
removed. The two K-band channels were combined to
improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The IFS data
were dark subtracted, bad pixel treated, ﬂat ﬁelded and
wavelength calibrated. The data were then resampled
into a cube of 39 images of 3.3% band width (∆λ/λ)
over the spectral range and with a scale of 0.0074(cid:48)(cid:48) per
spaxel. Isolated bright and dark pixels were found in the
IFS data which is due to imperfections in the wavelength
calibration procedure. The IDL routine acre (by Marc
Buie) was used to remove these via interpolation between
neighboring pixels.

Both systems were observed between UT December 6
and 9, 2014 as part of SPHERE science veriﬁcation. Ad-
ditional observations on Elektra were obtained on UT
December 30 and 31, 2014, using director’s discretionary
time. At each epoch, we also observed a nearby solar
analog (G2V) star to enable eﬀective removal of telluric
absorption artifacts and the solar color gradient. This
star also served as a point-spread-function (PSF) esti-
mate for each spectral channel.

3. ADDITIONAL IMAGE PROCESSING

The known moonlet of (130) Elektra is not far from
the primary and is nearly buried in the primary’s halo.
If this halo is not removed carefully, it could contaminate
the photometry of its moonlet. Below, we describe the
technique used to minimize the contamination from the
primary. A two-dimensional Gaussian was ﬁtted to the
primary to determine its optical center. The primary’s
halo was then removed beyond ∼0.15(cid:48)(cid:48) from the primary
In
using a process described in Wahhaj et al. (2013).
this method, local medians over arcs (centered on the
primary) of length 15–40 pixels are removed from each
pixel. The arc lengths used depended on spatial scale of
background structure, but were at least three times the
full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of any ﬁeld source.

One unavoidable side eﬀect of this process is that the
ﬂux of a moonlet is partially subtracted along with the
halo. To estimate this signal loss, we performed simula-
tions on the science data set. We inserted Gaussian point
sources into the reduced IFS images for wavelength. The

surface of the moonlets of neither system were resolved
by SPHERE and their PSFs, which depended on the AO
performance, had FWHMs close to the diﬀraction limit.
The FWHM of the simulated sources at each spectral
channel was determined by PSF ﬁtting of the standard
star that was observed right before or after the asteroid
observations. We then deﬁned annuli centered on the
primary, extending 10 pixels radially inwards and out-
wards from each satellite. In each annulus, we randomly
selected 200 positions and inserted two types of point
sources at each position. A strong source with 10 times
the estimated ﬂux of the satellite was used to estimate
the systematic ﬂux loss. A weaker source with a ﬂux
similar to that of the satellite was used to estimate the
random error of our photometric measurements. After
removing the primary’s halo, we measured the brightness
of the recovered sources using two methods: aperture
photometry and PSF ﬁtting. Our analysis showed that
the PSF ﬁtting method generally yields smaller photo-
metric uncertainties. However, when the moonlets were
too faint or exhibit an irregular shape due to high airmass
or poor AO correction, the PSF ﬁtting method failed to
emulate the PSF shape.
In these cases, aperture pho-
tometry was used instead.

4. DISCOVERY OF NEW SATELLITE S/2014 (130) 1

As a result of this process (see Figure 1), a new moon-
let, S/2014 (130) 1, was detected both in the IFS and
IRDIS data sets over several epochs. The strongest sig-
nal of the new moonlet was detected on UT December 9
when it was 0.36(cid:48)(cid:48) from the primary. On December 31,
the new inner satellite was only detected in the IFS data.
The weakened signal of the inner satellite was due to the
less favorable geometry where the asteroid system was
farther away from the Sun and the Earth. The relative
positions of the two satellites from the primary are listed
in Table 1. The diameters of the satellites, estimated
by calculating the integrated ﬂux ratio of the primary to
each companion, are also listed in Table 1. The eﬀective
diameter of the primary of 197 ± 20 km is adopted from
Marchis et al. (2012). Assuming that the satellites have
the same albedo as the primary, the estimated diameter
of the new moon, S/2014 (130) 1, is 2.0±1.5 km and the
estimated diameter for S/2003 (130) 1 is 6.0±1.5 km.

4.1. Numerical modeling and ﬁtting

We obtained the orbital parameters of the two satel-
lites of (130) Elektra using the numerical code ODIN
(Beauvalet et al. 2013), which simultaneously integrates
the heliocentric motion of the system, and the motion
of the individual components around their barycenter.
ODIN has been used to study the Pluto system and
the triple systems, such as (45) Eugenia and (87) Sylvia
(Beauvalet & Marchis 2014). Using ODIN to ﬁt Elek-
tra’s astrometric data and assuming that the masses of
the satellites are negligible, we obtained satisfactory or-
bital solutions for the two moonlets, see Figure 2a. For
satellite S/2003(130) 1, we also included the previous
observations from Marchis et al. (2008b) and compared
our results with those obtained by GENOID (Vachier et
al. 2012). We found that the two models provided very
similar results. The orbital periods for the inner and
the outer moonlets are 1.256±0.003d and 5.287±0.001d,
respectively. The residuals for the outer moonlet in

α ∗ cos(δ) and δ are: 20 mas and 25 mas, where α is
right ascension and δ is declination. For the inner satel-
lite, S/2014 (130) 1, the residuals in RA and DEC are
11 mas and 14 mas, respectively. We used the random
hold-out method described in Marchis et al. (2010) to
estimate the uncertainties of the orbital elements. We
randomly removed 3 observations from the dataset and
ﬁt the remaining observations to obtain an orbital solu-
tion. We repeated this process 100 times and adopted
3-σ uncertainty for each orbital element. We attempted
to ﬁt the gravitational harmonic parameter J2, which is
the main indicator of the mass distribution of the pri-
mary. We adopted an initial value of 0.13, based on
axial ratios from shape model estimates (Marchis et al.
2008b) and assumed a homogeneous interior. However,
we found reasonable orbital solutions for a wide range of
J2 values from 0 to 0.13. More astrometric observations,
especially of the inner moonlet, are needed to constrain
the J2 of the Elektra system.

4.2. Stability

We checked the stability of the orbits of the both satel-
lites of Elektra using ODIN, the accuracy of which has
been tested using other well-observed systems by simu-
lating them for >100 years. Our main goal is to verify
whether the orbits of the two moonlets are stable between
2006 and 2014. We performed two diﬀerent simulations
over 20 years. Neither of these simulations included the
Yarkovsky, YORP or tidal eﬀects, which are only needed
for very-long term integrations. In one simulation, the
masses of the satellites are negligible. In the other simu-
lation, the two satellites have masses of 7 × 1012 kg and
2 × 1014 kg respectively, assuming the same density as
the primary of 1.7 g/cm3 (Marchis et al. 2008b). Neither
simulation showed signiﬁcant instability over time. The
semi-major axis for S/2014 (130) 1 has a small oscilla-
tion spanning less than 100 meters. For S/2003 (130) 1,
semi-major axis oscillates less than 1.4 km.

5. COMPONENT-RESOLVED SPECTROSCOPY

5.1. The (130) Elektra system

The Elektra system was observed on four nights. How-
ever, we have reliable spectra for the inner moonlet from
December 09 and December 30 only. On UT December
9, the primarys halo varied signiﬁcantly in intensity over
small spatial scales near the inner moonlet. Hence we
used an arc length of 15 pixels for halo-removal. The so-
lar analog star, HD20926, had an average PSF FWHM
over 39 spectral channels of 5.3 pixels. The outer moon-
let is roughly 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48) away from the primary where the pri-
mary’s halo is more uniform and so an arc of length 30
pixels was used to remove the background ﬂux. On UT
December 30, given a diﬀerent AO performance, an arc
of length 40 pixels was used for the both moonlets for
the halo removal. The solar analog star, HD19315, had
an average PSF FWHM of 4.9 pixels. The spectra of
the Elektra system are presented in Figure 3, which have
been corrected for the systematic ﬂux loss estimated from
our simulations. We calculated the spectral slope, s(cid:48), the
fractional intensity change per 1000 ˚A, using a weighted
linear regression. We performed students’ t-test and cal-
culated P to compare the spectra of the satellites and
that of the primary, where P is used as an indicator to

3

determine whether the spectra of the individual compo-
nent are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. We found P=0.56 and
0.82 on UT December 09 and 30 respectively for the in-
ner moonlet and P=1.0 and 0.56 for the outer moonlet.
Since the p-values are much larger than the signiﬁcance
level of 0.05, we conclude that there is no signiﬁcant spec-
tral diﬀerence between the moonlets and the primary.

5.2. The (93) Minerva system

As shown in Figure 4a, the two moons are well sep-
arated from the primary in the IFS data and the halo
of the primary has been removed eﬀectively using the
same method described above. We adopted the eﬀec-
tive diameter of the primary of 154±6 km from Marchis
et al. (2013b) and estimated the sizes of the two satel-
lites using the ratios of the integrated ﬂuxes between
the satellites and the primary. Assuming the satellites
share the same albedos as the primary, the estimated
diameter for Aegis is 4.3±1.5 km and the diameter of
Gorgoneion is 3.7±1.5 km, which are consistent with the
previous diameter estimates of 3.6±1.0 km and 3.2±0.9
km in Marchis et al. (2013b). The large diﬀerences be-
tween the primary spectrum and the satellites’ spectra,
at wavelengths between 1.3 µm and 1.5 µm, are a result
of strong atmospheric absorption. We also performed a
t-test for the Minerva system. We found no discernible
diﬀerence between satellite and primary, both for Aegis
(P=0.64) and for Gorgoneion (P=0.79).

6. DISCUSSION

The major challenge in obtaining reliable component-
resolved spectroscopy of tight asteroid systems is the
bright halo of the primary and the variable sky back-
ground. The outer satellites, i.e. S/2003 (130) 1 and
I Aegis which are orbiting at 13 and 8 primary radii
and have detection SNR > 10, yield spectra which are
not very sensitive to our image processing methods. In
contrast, the spectral slopes of the inner moons (S/2014
(130) 1 and II Gorgoneion) are heavily inﬂuenced by the
halo removal process, because these two are closer to the
primary and are faint in comparison to the background
noise. As such, it is necessary to understand the impact
of the halo removal methods at diﬀerent wavelengths.
Inserting simulated sources with known PSFs and ﬂuxes
into the real dataset and processing the data in the same
manner as the science is perhaps the most reliable way
to correct photometric biases and estimate uncertainties.
Our simulations show large uncertainties in the spec-
tral measurements. Therefore, we are not able to fur-
ther investigate space weathering eﬀects on the individ-
ual components of the triple systems.
In terms of the
satellites, we detect no absorption band near 1.0 micron
and the spectral slopes of these moonlets are ﬂat (within
a few percent). Our IFS observations suggest that the
components of both the Elektra and the Minerva sys-
tems are similar in composition and the four satellites
are best classiﬁed as C-types. The rotational periods
for (130) Elektra and (93) Minerva are 5.225 and 5.982(cid:63)
hours respectively. Therefore, break-up from a high spin
rate is unlikely to have led to formation these triple sys-
tems. Given the small separations of the satellites from

their primaries and the large mass ratios between the
moonlets and primaries, an erosive impact is the most
likely explanation for both the Elektra and the Minerva
triple systems.

As of now, the eccentricity of the satellite orbits for
most multiple asteroid systems have not been estimated
because of the diﬃculty in obtaining suﬃcient position
measurements of the satellites. For the few systems for
which we have enough observations to characterize the
satellites’ orbits, a large range of eccentricities have been
observed, see Figure 2b. Our observations of (130) Elek-
tra reveal a unique case: both moonlets are on eccentric
orbits. We note that asteroid Elektra is elongated with
a/b ∼1.5. However, it is known that the elongation of
the primary has no long-term eﬀect on the eccentricity,
the semi-major axis or inclination (Murray & Dermott
2000). More detailed dynamical simulations of the or-

bital evolution of the asteroid triple systems are needed
to understand the diﬀerence in eccentricity between the
inner and the outer moon.

In summary, our SPHERE observations yield the fol-
lowing ﬁndings: 1) a new moonlet of (130) Elektra was
detected and the estimated diameter of this moon is
∼2km, 2) both the inner and the outer moonlet of (130)
Elektra are on orbits with non-negligible eccentricities, 3)
the reﬂectance spectra of the satellites of the (130) Elek-
tra and the (93) Minvera systems are similar to those of
their primaries, suggesting that both triple systems were
created by disruptive impacts.

Fig. 1.— Reduced IRDIS and IFS images of (130) Elektra, the triple asteroid system. The IFS images are the median combination of 31
of the 39 spectral channels. The channels severely aﬀected by the atmospheric absorption were not included. The IFS images are rotated
by 100.7 degree clockwise to align with the corresponding IRIDS data with PA=0. The pixels intensities within 0.25(cid:48)(cid:48) of the primary have
been divided by 1500 to make the faint satellites more easily viewable. A new satellite S/2014 (130) S1 was detected in both the IRDIS
and IFS data sets in most epochs. This inner moon detection was weaker in the December 31 data and was only identiﬁed in the IFS data.

Fig. 2.— Left: the grey dashed lines show the best-ﬁt orbit for S/2003 S1, as it evolved over many epochs, and the pink line is the best-ﬁt
orbit for S/2014 S1. The blue and green solid circles are the astrometric measurements of the two moonlets. The red and pink pluses
are the simulated positions using the dynamical model ODIN. The uncertainties of the orbital elements are 3-σ errors derived using the
random hold-out method. Right: the eccentricities of the satellites that belong to the 5 known triple systems; as is the semi-major axis of
the satellite’s orbit and RHill is the Hill radius of the primary. References: Marchis et al. (2010)[M10], Descamps et al. (2011)[D11], Fang
et al. (2012)[F12], Marchis et al. (2013b)[M13b].

Fig. 3.— The relative reﬂectance spectra of the (130) Elektra system, normalized at 1.0 µm. Left: Spectra of the two satellites and the
primary obtained on UT December 09, using PSF ﬁtting. Right: Spectra of the two satellites and the primary obtained on UT December
30. The spectrum of the inner moon, obtained via aperture photometry. The spectra of the primary and the outer moon were obtained
via PSF ﬁtting. For comparison, we also plot the near infrared spectrum of the primary obtained with the 3.0 m IRTF telescope by Takir
& Emery (2012). The wavelength range aﬀected by telluric absorption is shaded in the plot.
