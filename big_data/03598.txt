Abstract

The Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue method is employed to analytically investigate the
properties of holographic superconductors in higher dimensions in the framework
of Born-Infeld electrodynamics incorporating the eﬀects of noncommutative space-
time. In the background of pure Einstein gravity in noncommutative spacetime, we
obtain the relation between the critical temperature and the charge density. We also
obtain the value of the condensation operator and the critical exponent. Our ﬁnd-
ings suggest that higher the value of noncommutative parameter and Born-Infeld
parameter make the condensate harder to form. We also observe that the critical
temperature depends on the mass of the black hole and higher value of black hole
mass is favourable for the formation of the condensate.

Introduction

Holographic superconductors have been studied extensively in recent times. Their impor-
tance lies in the fact that they mimic some properties of high Tc superconductors. The
interest rose after the demonstration in [1] that an Abelian Higgs model in AdS space-
time leads to a spontaneous symmetry breaking and thus giving rise to a scalar hair near
the horizon of the black hole. The important ingredient which goes in the construction
of such holographic superconductor models is the correspondence between gravity and
gauge theory, namely,the AdS/CFT correspondence [2].
Spacetime noncommutativity has been another prominent area of research in recent years.
The idea of noncommutative (NC) spacetime, ﬁrst formally introduced by Snyder [3] back
in 1947 was not considered seriously by other scientist till recently when such a structure
emerged naturally from investigations carried out in string theory [4].
It was in this

paper that NC ﬁeld theory was resurrected and rules were given to move from ordinary
quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) to NC QFT. In more recent times, a noncommutative inspired
Schwarzschild metric was obtained in [5, 6]. Here the eﬀect of noncommutativity was
introduced through a smeared matter source which was then used to solved Einstein’s
equation of general relativity. An important aspect of this black hole solution was the
removal of black hole singularity. The thermodynamics of this black hole solution was
investigated in details in [7].
In this paper, we want to investigate the role of NC geometry on the AdS/CFT duality, in
particular to study its eﬀect on holographic superconductor models in higher dimensions.
Such a study had been carried out earlier in [8] in 4−dimensions. Here we generalize this
analysis to arbitrary dimensions by considering the d−dimensional generalization of the
NC Schwarzschild black hole. We also present expressions for the critical temperature
which is more accurate than the one given in [8] as will be clear in the subsequent discus-
sion. Further we consider Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics thereby including the eﬀect
of non-linearity in the analysis. There are quite a few reasons which makes it worthwhile
to study the eﬀect of BI electrodynamics. First of all, it is the only non-linear theory
that remains invariant under electromagnetic duality. Another intriguing feature is that
it has a nice weak ﬁeld limit [9] - [12]. It also ﬁnds remarkable application in string the-
ory [13, 14]. We would like to mention that the technique that we have adopted in this
paper to obtain the relation between the critical temperature and the charge density is
the Sturm-Liouville (SL) eigenvalue approach.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we show the basic holographic set up in
noncommutative spcetime in the background of electrically charged black hole in arbitrary
dimension. In section 3, taking into account the eﬀect of the Born-Infeld electrodynamics,
we have derived the relation between critical temperature and charge density using the
Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem. In section 4, we analytically obtain an expression
for the condensation operator in d-dimension near the critical temperature. We conclude
ﬁnally in section 5.

action on the spacetime metric f (r) is not taken into account.
The Hawking temperature of this black hole, which is interpreted as the temperature of
the conformal ﬁeld theory on the boundary, is given by

where r+ is the radius of the horizon of the black hole.
Since the construction of the holographic s−wave superconductor requires a planar sym-
metry, we set K = 0 which implies that

where prime denotes derivative with respect to r. The rescalings ψ → ψ/q, φ → φ/q and
κ2 → q2κ2 [17] allows one to set q = 1.
To solve the above non-linear coupled diﬀerential equations (10)-(11), we must ﬁx the
boundary condition for φ(r) and ψ(r) which are physically acceptable. For regularization,
one requires φ(r+) = 0 and ψ(r+) to be ﬁnite at the horizon.
Near the boundary of the bulk, the asymptotic behaviour of ψ and φ are not aﬀected by
4θ (cid:28) 1
noncommutativity. This is because near the boundary, r is large and therefore e
since θ is small. The asymptotic behaviour of the ﬁelds can be written as [18]

(14)

The gauge/gravity duality allows one to interpret ρ and µ as the charge density and
chemical potential of the boundary ﬁeld theory. For the choice m2 = −3 with the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound [19], we have ∆+ = 3 ∆− = 1 for d = 5. This allows
one to choose ψ+ or ψ−. In this paper we shall choose ψ− = 0. This basically means that
ψ+ is dual to the expectation value of the condensation operator J in the absence of the
source ψ−.

where prime now denotes derivative with respect to z. These equations are to be solved
in the interval (0, 1), where z = 1 is the horizon and z = 0 is the boundary. The boundary
condition φ(r+) = 0 now becomes φ(z = 1) = 0.

3 Critical temperature (Tc) and charge density (ρ)
To begin the analysis, we ﬁrst note that for T ≥ Tc, the matter ﬁeld must vanish. We
want to study the behaviour of ψ(r) just below the critical temperature (Tc). For that we
ﬁrst need to solve the φ(r) at T = Tc, where ψ(r) vanishes. Hence eq.(16) reduces to

(d − 2)bz3

+(c)

φ(cid:48)(z)3 = 0.

(17)

We now employ the perturbative technique developed in [20] to solve the above equation.
When b = 0, the solution of the above equation (compatible the boundary condition of
φ(z)) reads

where

φ(z)|b=0 = λr+(c)(1 − zd−3)

λ =

ρ
rd−2

+(c)

.

(18)

(19)

To solve eq.(17), we put the solution for φ(z) with b = 0 (i.e. φ(z)|b=0) in the non-linear
term of eq.(17). This leads to

φ(cid:48)(cid:48)(z) − d − 4

z

φ(cid:48)(z) − bλ3r+(c)(d − 2)(d − 3)3z3(d−3) = 0.

(20)

Using the asymptotic boundary condition (12), the solution of the above equation upto
ﬁrst order in the Born-Infeld parameter b reads

(1 − zd−3) − b(λ2|b=0)(d − 3)3

where we have used the fact that bλ2 = b(λ2|b=0) + O(b2) [20], λ2|b=0 being the value of
λ2 for b = 0.
Under change of coordinate z = r+

In the θ = 0 limit (commutative case), Ξ = 1 and Tc = 1
. So the values of Tc does

not get aﬀected by the mass of black hole. For θ = 0, we have λ2
˜α=0.7218 = 18.23 for b = 0,
which can be obtained by following the procedure in [20]. Using this value of λ2, we get
Tc = 0.1962ρ1/3 which is in very good agreement with the exact value Tc = 0.1980ρ1/3
[22]. The eﬀect of Born-Infeld parameter had been studied in arbitrary dimensions for
commutative Einstein gravity and Gauss-Bonnet gravity in details [16]. In this paper we
have included the eﬀect of spacetime noncommutativity along with the eﬀect of Born-
Infeld parameter. We have calculated the Tc values for diﬀerent set of θ, M, b values.
We have show that noncommutative parameter is not favourable for condensation.

As a byproduct of our analysis, we ﬁnd that the critical exponent is 1/2 which is not
aﬀected by the noncommutativity of spacetime.

For θ = 0, we recover the commutative result β1 = 7.705 which is very good agreement
with exact value β1 = 7.706 [23].
In Tables 4, 5, 6, we present our analytical values of β1 obtained by the SL eigenvalue
approach for diﬀerent sets of values of b, M and θ.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we have investigated the role of noncommutativity of spacetime in holo-
graphic superconductors in the framework of BI electrodynamics.
In our analysis, we
have obtained the relation between the critical temperature and the charge density in

d−dimensions. We observe that critical temperature not only depends on the charge den-
sity but also on the noncommutative parameter θ and the mass of the black hole. We
have presented the expressions of Tc for d = 4, 5. We have analytically calculated critical
temperature Tc and the condensation operator (cid:104)J(cid:105) for d = 5. Our analytic results show
that the condensation gets harder to form in the presence of Born-Infeld parameter and
the noncommutativity of spacetime. It is also observed that the formation of the conden-
sate is favoured for large black hole mass. As a future work, we would like to study the
set up away from the probe limit for Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
