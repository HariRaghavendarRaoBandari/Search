Abstract
The electric solar wind sail (E-sail) is a way to propel a spacecraft by using the natural solar wind as a thrust source.
The problem of secular spinrate change was identiﬁed earlier which is due to the orbital Coriolis eﬀect and tends to
slowly increase or decrease the sail’s spinrate, depending on which way the sail is inclined with respect to the solar
wind. Here we present an E-sail design and its associated control algorithm which enable spinrate control during
propulsive ﬂight by the E-sail eﬀect itself. In the design, every other maintether (“T-tether”) is galvanically connected
through the remote unit with the two adjacent auxtethers, while the other maintethers (“I-tethers”) are insulated from
the tethers. This enables one to eﬀectively control the maintether and auxtether voltages separately, which in turn
enables spinrate control. We use a detailed numerical simulation to show that the algorithm can fully control the E-
sail’s spin state in real solar wind. The simulation includes a simple and realistic set of controller sensors: an imager
to detect remote unit angular positions and a vector accelerometer. The imager resolution requirement is modest and
the accelerometer noise requirement is feasible to achieve. The TI tether rig enables building E-sails that are able
to control their spin state fully and yet are actuated by pure tether voltage modulation from the main spacecraft and
requiring no functionalities from the remote units during ﬂight.

1. Introduction

The solar wind electric sail (E-sail) is a concept how
to propel a spacecraft in the solar system using the natu-
ral solar wind (SW) [1, 2]. The E-sail uses a number of
thin metallic and centrifugally stretched tethers which
are biased at high positive potential (Fig. 1). The bias-
ing is eﬀected by an onboard electron gun which con-
tinuously pumps out negative charge from the tethers.

Figure 1: Schematic presentation of the E-sail.

The following secular spinrate change problem was,
however, identiﬁed [11]. When an E-sail orbits around
the sun with the sail inclined with respect to the SW,
the orbital Coriolis eﬀect causes a secular increase or
decrease of the spinrate. Inclining the sail is necessary
if one wants to produce transverse thrust perpendicular
to the SW direction, which is usually the case. Specif-
ically, if the sail is inclined so that it brakes the orbital
motion and keeps the spacecraft spiralling towards the
sun, the spinrate decreases, and if the sail is inclined in
the opposite way so that the orbit is an outward mov-
ing spiral, the spinrate increases. The rate of spinrate
increase or decrease obeys approximately the equation

ω(t) ≈ ω(0)e±(Ω tan α)t.

(1)

Here Ω is the angular frequency of the heliocentric orbit
and α is the sail angle, i.e. the (positive) angle between
the sail spin axis and the SW direction. For example if
α is 35◦ and the spacecraft is in a circular orbit at 1 au
distance, the spinrate changes by 9 % in each week. To
overcome the problem, various technical solutions were
proposed and analysed, for example the use of ionic
liquid ﬁeld-eﬀect electric propulsion (FEEP) thrusters
[8, 9, 7] or photonic blades [5] on the remote units.

In this paper we present a novel design concept (the
TI tether rig) for the E-sail which overcomes the secular
spinrate problem and yields a technically simple hard-
ware. We also present a control algorithm and demon-
strate by detailed numerical simulation that the algo-
rithm is able to ﬂy the E-sail in real SW with full ca-
pability to control the orientation of the spin plane and
the spinrate. We also demonstrate that the algorithm is
able to accomplish its task using a simple set of sensors
(remote unit position imager and vector accelerometer)
with realistic amount of measurement noise.

The structure of the paper is as follows. We show that
electric auxtethers enable spinrate control, present the
TI tether rig design, the control algorithm, the dynam-
ical simulation model and the simulation results. The
paper closes with summary and conclusions.

2. Electric auxtethers enable spinrate control

We consider an E-sail as in Fig. 2 where the auxil-
iary tethers (auxtethers) are metallic and can be biased
at high voltage, similarly to the maintethers. A segment
of an auxtether then generates E-sail thrust which is per-
pendicular to it. Our aim is then to show that if the aux-
tether voltages can be controlled independently from the
maintether voltages, spinrate control becomes possible.

lel or antiparallel with the y axis. By having the same
Fn but diﬀerent Fs in the upstream and downstream por-
tions of the maintether’s rotation cycle, we can modify
the sail’s spin rate while keeping its orientation ﬁxed.
Separate control of sail spinrate and spinplane orienta-
tion becomes possible because one has two control pa-
rameters in each angular segment, namely maintether
voltage and auxtether voltage.

3. TI tether rig

To enable separate control of auxtether and main-
tether voltages, one could use various technical means,
for example, each remote unit could carry a potentiome-
ter or other means of regulating the auxtether voltage
between zero and the maintether voltage. However, we
propose a simpler arrangement where the remote units
need no active parts. We propose that even-numbered
maintethers are such that their remote unit is galvan-
ically connected with both the left-side and right-side
auxtethers (Fig. 4, blue), while odd-numbered main-
tethers are electrically insulated from the remote unit
(Fig. 4, red). We call the even-numbered tethers the
T-tethers because of the T-shaped shape of the blue
equipotential region, and odd-numbered tethers are cor-
respondingly called I-tethers.

Figure 4: Schematic presentation of the TI tether rig.

In a given angular sector of the sail, we can eﬀectively
increase (decrease) the auxtether voltages by setting T-
tethers to higher (lower) voltage than I-tethers. The aux-
tethers are always at the same potential as their asso-
ciated T-tether so that no potentiometers or other func-
tional parts are needed on the remote units. Two types of

Figure 2: Three-dimensional schematic presentation of spinning pla-
nar E-sail inclined at angle α with respect to SW ﬂow (α lies in the
xz plane). Lines below y == 0 plane are drawn in greyscale to ease
visualisation. The z coordinate is along the SW.

Figure 3a again shows an E-sail inclined at angle α to
the SW ﬂow, but now viewed from the top, antiparallel
to the y axis. Consider a maintether in the xz plane i.e. in
the plane of Fig. 3a. The maintether generates a thrust
vector F which is perpendicular to itself.
Figure 3b shows the same maintether 90◦ rotation
later when it is parallel to y axis. Now, because the
tether is perpendicular to the SW, its thrust vector F
is aligned with the SW. We decompose F in spinplane
component Fs and spinplane normal component Fn.
The spinplane component Fs brakes the tether’s spinrate
when it moves upstream and accelerates it 180◦ rotation
later, and the net eﬀect vanishes.

Panel 3c is the same as panel 3b, but we have added
a charged auxtether segment at the tip of the maintether.
The thrust vector F is now a vector sum of the main-
tether thrust and the auxtether thrust. The maintether
thrust is still along the SW ﬂow as it was in 3b, but
the auxtether’s thrust contribution is perpendicular to
the auxtether, i.e. perpendicular to the spin plane. As
a result, F is not aligned with the SW and the ratio
Fs/Fn depends on the ratio of the auxtether thrust ver-
sus the maintether thrust. In particular, by modulating
the auxtether and maintether voltages separately, the ra-
tio Fs/Fn can be diﬀerent when the maintether is paral-

remote units are needed: ones that provide galvanic con-
nection between the maintether and the two auxtethers,
and ones that provide an insulating connection between
all three connecting tethers. As usual, the remote units
contain reels of the auxtethers which are used during de-
ployment phase. During propulsive ﬂight, no function-
ality is required from the remote units. The units only
have to continue to provide the mechanical and electri-
cal connection which is of galvanic and insulating type
of even and odd-numbered units, respectively. Because
of the presence of T-tethers and I-tethers, we call the
design as a whole the TI tether rig.

4. Control algorithm

The control algorithm consists of six throttling fac-
tors which are multiplied together at the end to yield
the voltage throttling of each maintether. The six fac-
tors and their roles in the control algorithm are listed in
Table 1.

Let r = (x, y, z) be the remote unit’s position vector
relative to the spacecraft and ˆer = r/r is the correspond-

ing unit vector. We denote the angular momentum of
the tether rig by L and the corresponding unit vector
(spin axis vector) by ˆs = L/L. The controller computes
instantaneous angular momentum Linst approximately
from imaged positions r of the remote units and their
velocities v found by ﬁnite diﬀerencing with ∆t = 2 s
timestep. The angular momentum L used by the con-
trol algorithm below is a time-averaged version of Linst
which is obtained by continuously solving the diﬀeren-
tial equation

averaging.

4.1. Factor f1

The ﬁrst throttling factor is

(cid:17)

(3)

f1 = max

where gt = 1.0 is a greediness parameter for spinplane
turning and ˆngoal is the goal spin axis orientation. The
factor f1 is responsible for turning the spinplane when
ˆs (cid:44) ˆngoal. It modulates the tether voltages so that the
SW thrust applies a torque to the tether rig.

4.2. Factor f2

The second throttling factor f2 takes care of keeping
the spinplane orientation constant. The second factor is

f2 = (1 − A)K + A

and the auxiliary factor

A =

1 + Nw/(2π) .

(5)

(6)

The algorithm works moderately well even if A = 0, but
it works better if A has the value (6). The denomina-
tor of K is the tether-perpendicular component of ˆnSW.
If the tethers spin rapidly so that they move nearly in
a plane without coning, K does not depend on tether
phase angle. However, in a real sail some coning oc-
curs. Then the K factor decreases and increases thrust
on the upwind and downwind orientations of the spin-
ning tether, respectively, to keep the total torque zero.

4.3. Factor f3

The third throttling factor f3 takes care of increasing
or decreasing the spin rate. First we deﬁne the spinrate
increase factor S by

(cid:34)

(cid:35)

S = gs

sgoal − |L|
|L(0)|

.

(7)

Here gs = 2.0 is the spinrate increase greediness factor
and sgoal is the goal for the relative spinrate, i.e. the an-
gular mometum magnitude relative to the initial angular
momentum magnitude |L(0)|. The throttling factor is
given by

f3 = 1 − clamp (±S ˆv · ˆnSW,−cst, cst) .

(8)

Here v is the instantaneous velocity of the remote unit
(relative to the spacecraft, similarly to r) and cst = 0.2 is
the maximum allowed amplitude of our sawtooth tether
modulation. Plus sign is selected for T-tethers and mi-
nus sign for I-tethers. The function clamp forces the
ﬁrst argument within given limits a and b, a ≤ b. For
any x, clamp (x) is deﬁned by

clamp (x, a, b) = max(a, min(x, b))

(9)

The controller algorithm as described up to now
works, but it does not damp tether oscillations that are
produced by SW variations and the spinplane manoeu-
vres. Neither does it set the E-sail thrust to a wanted
value. The purpose of the remaining factors f4, f5 and
f6 is to take care of these.

For the ﬁrst damping related factor, f4, we measure
the spin-axis aligned speed vs (sign convention: posi-
tive sunward) of the remote units relative to the space-
craft, averaged over the remote units. The measurement
is done by ﬁnite diﬀerencing the imaged remote unit an-
gular positions and the throttling factor is

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

f4 = 1 + min

0, gd

vs
vtot

(10)

where gd = 3.0 is greediness factor for damping and vtot
is the average rotation speed of the remote units with
respect to the spacecraft. The idea is that if the tether
rig oscillates collectively along the spin axis so that the
tether cone angle changes periodically, the oscillation is
damped if voltages are slightly throttled down when the
rig is moving in the direction of the SW.

4.5. Factor f5

The factor f4 reduces collective oscillation of the
whole tether rig, but each tether can also oscillate indi-
vidually like a guitar string between the spacecraft and
the remote unit. For reducing these a bit faster oscil-
lations we introduce throttling factor f5. We measure
the instantaneous thrust force Fsc acting on the space-
craft body (at 20 s resolution) by an onboard vector
accelerometer. Notice that Fsc is the force exerted on
the spacecraft by the tethers which is usually not equal
to the total E-sail force exerted on the whole tether
rig, except as an average over a long enough time pe-
riod. When |Fsc| increases signiﬁcantly, we apply over-
all throttling f5 to tether voltages where

Here τd5 = 1200 s is a damping timescale parameter,
dmax = 0.05 is the maximum applied thrust reduction
due to damping and F0 is the typical tether tension mul-
tiplied by the number of tethers Nw. We set the typical
tension equal to the tether tension in the initial state.

4.6. Factor f6

The ﬁnal throttling factor f6 is used to settle the E-sail
thrust to a wanted value Fgoal. We estimate the E-sail
thrust on the tether rig as

the spacecraft (determined by imaging and ﬁnite diﬀer-
encing the remote unit angular positions) and mrig, mtot

is the mass of the tether rig and the total mass, respec-
tively. The ﬁrst term is due to acceleration of the tether
rig with respect to the spacecraft body and the second
term is due to acceleration of the spacecraft with re-
spect to an inertial frame of reference. The time average
of the ﬁrst term is obviously zero, but its instantaneous
value is usually nonzero and it carries information about
tether rig oscillations that we want to damp. The instan-
taneous thrust exerted on the whole system (spacecraft
plus tether rig) is

Ftot = Fsc + Frig.

(13)

From the instantaneous Ftot we calculate a time-
averaged version Fave

it goes outside bounds (0, f max

4.7. Combining the throttling factors

The total throttling factor is

f =

f1 f2 f3

max( f1 f2 f3)

f4 f5 min(1, f6).

(16)

where the maximum is taken over the maintethers.

Factors f4, f5 and f6 are updated at ∆td = 20 s inter-
vals while f1, f2 and f3 are updated with ∆t = 2 s time
resolution. The motivation for using slower updating of
f4, f5 and f6 is only to save onboard computing power.
The computing power requirement is low in any case,
but as a matter of principle we want to avoid unneces-
sary onboard computing cycles.

Factors f4 and f5 make only small modiﬁcations to
the total throttling factor f . Despite this, their ability to
damp tether rig oscillations is profound.

The tether voltages are modulated by f . We assume
in this paper that the E-sail force depends linearly on
V so that we can achieve the wanted force throttling by

simply modulation the voltages by f . This should be a
rather good approximation (see equation 3 of Janhunen
et al. [2]). Were this assumption not made, the nonlin-
ear relationship should be modelled or determined ex-
perimentally and then used during ﬂight to map thrust
modulation values f into voltage modulation values.

5. Simulation model

We use a dynamical simulator which was build for
simulating dynamical behaviour of the E-sail tether rig
[3, 4]. The simulator models the E-sail as a collection
of point masses, rigid bodies and interaction forces be-
tween them. Also external forces and torques can be
included. The core of the simulator solves the ordinary
diﬀerential equations corresponding to Newton’s laws
for the collection the bodies. The solver is an eight or-
der accurate adaptive Runge-Kutta solver adapted from
Press et al. [10]. The solver provides in practice fully ac-
curate discretisation in time. The only essential approxi-
mation is replacing continuous tethers by chains of point
masses connected by interaction forces that model their
elasticity. The E-sail force is included in the model.
Synthetic or satellite-measured SW data can be used as
the source. Table 2 summarises the main parameters of
the simulation used in this paper.

h the α angle goal is returned back to zero. Thus, Run 1
exercises a back and forth swing of the tether rig. Spin-
rate regulation greediness parameter gs is set to zero in
Run 1 so that we can observe the natural tendency of
the spinrate to vary during the turning manoeuvre. The
spinrate (Fig. 5, panel d) increases up to 25 % from the
initial value when the sail reaches ≈ 45◦ angle. The in-
crease is due to conservation of the sun-directed angular
momentum component Lz: |L| =
z must

The control algorithm needs only two types of sen-
sors. Firstly, we need imaging sensors to detect the an-
gular positions of the remote units with moderate angu-
lar 0.17◦ resolution and 2 s temporal resolution. The
angular resolution requirement corresponds to about
2200×530 pixels, either in a single panoramic imager
or several small imagers along the spacecraft’s perime-
ter. Secondly, we need a vector accelerometer onboard
the main spacecraft, for which we assume noise level
of 1.5 µg/
Hz. A low-noise low-noise accelerome-
ter such as Colibrys SF-1500 has noise level ﬁve times
smaller than this. The imager resolution and accelerom-
eter noise level were found by numerical experimenta-
tion. The chosen values are optimal in the sense that
smaller measurement error in sensors would not notice-
ably improve the ﬁdelity of the control and its oscilla-
tion damping properties.

This is done to avoid inducing tether oscillations as an
initial transient: although the algorithm can damp such
oscillations, damping would not occur immediately.
In Run 1 (Fig. 5), the tilt angle goal (panel a) is zero
until 12 h, then it is set to 45◦ where it remains for 18
hours. The sail starts turning when the angle is set and
reaches almost 45◦ angle after 18 hours. Then the φ an-
gle goal is changed from 90◦ to -90◦ so that the sail starts
turning again, via zero to the opposite direction. At 48

In Run 2 (Fig. 6), the goal α angle is put to 35◦
throughout. The spinrate control greediness parame-
ter gd is put to its normal value of 2.0. The spinrate
goal is 110 % spin for the ﬁrst 18 hours and is put to
very large value after that. The controller turns the spin-
plane smoothly to 35◦ which also increases the spinrate
moderately because of Lz conservation. When the spin-
rate goal is put high, the spinrate starts to increase al-
most linearly, reaching 60 % increase at the end of the
run which is 2.25 days since setting the spinrate goal
high. As a byproduct of the spinrate increase part of
the algorithm, the sail angle (Fig. 6, panel a) decreases
slightly from 35◦ to about 30◦. The reason is that the
spinrate modiﬁcation and tilt angle modiﬁcation parts
of the controller algorithm slightly compete with each
other because both use the same tether voltages for ac-
tuation. We do not expect this competition to be a prac-
tical issue because usually (to compensate the secular
trend) the wanted spinrate change is much slower than
in Run 2. In any case, Run 2 shows that if needed for
any reason, the spinrate can be increased in a matter of
few days with the model sail.

Run 3 (Fig. 7) is similar to Run 2, but now we demon-
strate decreasing rather than increaseing of the spinrate.
The spinrate goal is put to 40 % at 18 h. The spin slows
down obediently. In this case the sail angle increases
somewhat above the goal value 35◦.
Finally, in Run 4 we simulate a typical use case of
the E-sail. We set the sail angle α goal to 35◦ and
the spinrate goal at 100 %. In Run 4 we also use real
SW data to drive the E-sail where t = 0 corresponds to
epoch January 1, 2000, 00:00 UT. The used SW data
comes from NASA/GSFCV’s OMNI 1-minute resolu-
tion dataset through OMNIWeb (Fig. 9,[6]).

Gaps in OMNI data were ﬁlled by the following sim-
ple algorithm (Fig. 10). Let f (t) be the data which has a
gap at t1<t<t2. Mirror the data before t1 to make a func-
tion f1(t) = f (2t1 − t). Now, function f1(t) ﬁlls the gap
[t1, t2] with data that has the same spectral content as the
real data f (t)|t<t1. The ﬁller f1(t) has, however, a dis-
continuity where the gap ends at t2 and we return to real
data f (t)|t>t2. To remedy this, we carry out a similar
procedure at the other end, mirroring data around t2 to
get f2(t) = f (2t2−t). Finally we construct the ﬁller ˜f (t),
t1<t<t2, by linear interpolation between f1(t) and f2(t):
˜f (t) = (1 − u) f1(t) + u f2(t) where u = (t − t1)/(t2 − t1).

7. Summary and conclusions

Figure 6: Same as Fig. 5 but for Run 2: demonstration of rapid spin
increase.

the following requirements:

1. Control of tether voltages from the main spacecraft

is the only actuation mechanism.

2. Capability to control the orientation of the spin
plane and thereby the orientation of the E-sail
thrust vector.

3. Delivery of the wanted amount of E-sail thrust.
4. Spinrate acceleration and deceleration capability.
With typical parameters, the spinrate modiﬁcation
control authority is many times larger than what is
needed to overcome the heliocentric orbit Coriolis
eﬀect.

5. Remote units have no functionality requirements

after deployment.

6. Algorithmic automatic capability to damp tether

oscillations.

We have presented a new E-sail design and its accom-
panying control algorithm and sensor set which satisﬁes

7. Both maintethers and auxtethers are biased and

thereby propulsive.

10. The accelerometer should have low noise (<
Hz), but devices exist (e.g. Colibrys SF-

1.5µg/
1500) whose noise level is even ﬁve times less.

In the simulations of this paper we did not study de-
ployment, but an obvious question is if the spinrate in-
crease capability of the algorithm would be enough to
deploy the sail in reasonable time. Based on our pre-
liminary analysis, the answer seems to be yes, provided
that deployment to a few hundred metre tether length is
ﬁrst achieved by some other means.

Another future work that could be performed with our
simulation is systematic analysis of average and max-
imum tether tension. Although not reported here, we
have already monitored tether tension in our simula-
tions, and the version of the control algorithm presented

in this paper (Table 3) was arrived at partly by trial and
error minimisation of the maximum tether tension when
thrust was kept ﬁxed.

We think that the TI tether rig is a signiﬁcant step for-
ward in E-sail design particularly because it enables full
control of the angular momentum vector while not re-
quiring any functionality from the remote units during
ﬂight. As a result, the secular spinrate problem orig-
inally identiﬁed by Toivanen and Janhunen [11] gets
solved in a simple way.
