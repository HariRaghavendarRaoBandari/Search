SYMMETRIZATION IN GEOMETRY

GABRIELE BIANCHI, RICHARD J. GARDNER, AND PAOLO GRONCHI

March 3, 2016

Abstract. The concept of an i-symmetrization is introduced, which provides a convenient
framework for most of the familiar symmetrization processes on convex sets. Various prop-
erties of i-symmetrizations are introduced and the relations between them investigated. New
expressions are provided for the Steiner and Minkowski symmetrals of a compact convex set
which exhibit a dual relationship between them. Characterizations of Steiner and Minkowski
symmetrization, in terms of natural properties that they enjoy, are given and examples are
provided to show that none of the assumptions made can be dropped or signiﬁcantly weak-
ened. Other familiar symmetrizations, such as Schwarz symmetrization, are discussed and
several new ones introduced.

1. Introduction

Around 1836, Jakob Steiner introduced the process now known as Steiner symmetrization
in attempting to prove the isoperimetric inequality. His proof was incomplete, since he as-
sumed the existence of the extremum, but a standard modern approach (see, for example, [12,
Chapter 9]) is still based on Steiner symmetrization. Indeed, Steiner symmetrization remains
an extremely potent technique in geometry, where it has found frequent use, for instance in
the demonstration of a variety of powerful aﬃne isoperimetric inequalities. See, for example,
[8, Chapter 9], [12, Chapter 9], [27, Chapter 10], and the references given there. Beyond
geometry, Steiner symmetrization plays an important role in several areas of mathematics,
particularly analysis and PDEs. The latter development was stimulated by the appearance
of the classic text of P´olya and Szeg¨o [25], which inspired a huge number of works. See, for
example, [2, 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 29], and the references given in these texts.

Despite the vast literature surrounding Steiner symmetrization and its applications, we
are not aware of a characterization of it, and one purpose of this paper is to provide some.
We also formulate a general framework for many symmetrizations: For i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}
and an i-dimensional subspace H in Rn, we call a map ♦, from a class B of nonempty
compact sets in Rn to the subclass BH of members of B that are H-symmetric (i.e., symmetric
with respect to H), an i-symmetrization on B. With this terminology in place, we show
that Steiner symmetrization is the unique (n − 1)-symmetrization on convex bodies in Rn,

n ≥ 2, that is monotonic, volume preserving, and either invariant on H-symmetric cylinders
or projection invariant. (See Section 3 for the deﬁnitions of these properties and Section 2 for
basic terminology and notation.) The version assuming invariance on H-symmetric cylinders
is a consequence of a result we prove for Steiner symmetrization on compact sets in Rn, n ≥ 2.
Examples are given that suggest that the familiar generalization of Steiner symmetrization
called Schwarz symmetrization may be diﬃcult to classify in a nontrivial manner.

Another process familiar in geometry is now usually called Minkowski symmetrization,
despite being introduced by Blaschke (see [12, p. 174] and [27, p. 181]), because up to a
scaling factor it involves taking the Minkowski sum of a set and its reﬂection in a subspace. The
signiﬁcance of the Minkowski symmetral of a compact convex set stems partly from the fact
that it contains the Steiner symmetral of the set. This relationship has been found particularly
useful in studying the convergence of successive Steiner symmetrals. See, for example, [5], [12,
Chapter 9], [27, Notes for Sections 3.3 and 10.3], and the references there for the many deep
results on this topic by various authors. We prove that Minkowski symmetrization is the
unique (n − 1)-symmetrization on convex bodies (or on compact convex sets) in Rn, n ≥ 2,
that is monotonic, mean width preserving, and either invariant on H-symmetric cylinders or
projection invariant.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 3, as well as introducing i-symmetrizations,
we deﬁne the eight main properties of them that we ﬁnd the most useful and indicate which
of them are or are not enjoyed by the main known symmetrizations, namely, pth central
symmetrization and Steiner, Schwarz, Minkowski, Minkowski-Blaschke, and Blaschke sym-
metrizations. To this list we add another, ﬁber symmetrization, which includes Steiner and
Minkowski symmetrization as special cases. We regard this as having essentially been intro-
duced by McMullen [24], though we substantially generalize the concept. In Theorem 3.1 we
prove that when n = 3 and i ≥ 1, Blaschke symmetrization is not projection invariant.
Section 4, on projection covariant symmetrizations, may be regarded as a sequel to the
investigation of Gardner, Hug, and Weil [9, 10] into additions, such as Minkowski and Lp ad-
dition, in convex geometry. In fact, certain symmetrizations, such as central symmetrization,
result from adding a set to its reﬂection in the origin. Such procedures form a subclass of
the 0-symmetrizations (i.e., i-symmetrizations with i = 0), and [9, Section 8] contains sev-
eral results classifying members of this subclass.
In particular, [9, Corollary 8.4] (see also
[1]) classiﬁes central symmetrization, deﬁned by (3) below. Another new symmetrization,
M-symmetrization, is introduced in Section 4 and employs the notion of M-addition stud-
ied in [9, 10]. There are many other symmetrization processes in geometry, such as those
leading to the fundamental notions of projection body, intersection body, and centroid body
(see [8, 27]). These are examples of 0-symmetrizations not covered by the results in [9] or
the present paper. However, characterizations of these and related bodies have been obtained
using valuation theory; see, for example [21, 22].

Two more natural generalizations of Steiner and Minkowski symmetrization, that we call
the inner and outer rotational symmetrizations, are deﬁned in Section 5, along with several
others that are useful in showing that the properties we assume in our results cannot be
omitted.

Section 7 examines how the various properties of i-symmetrizations relate to each other. A
signiﬁcant role is played by monotonicity and idempotence, the natural property that repeat-
ing the symmetrization with respect to the same subspace has no eﬀect. In Theorem 7.1, we
also obtain new expressions for the Steiner and Minkowski symmetrals of a compact convex
set that bring to light the dual relationship between them. The latter of these expressions is
used in obtaining our characterization of Minkowski symmetrization mentioned above. Corol-
lary 7.3 gives properties which ensure that an i-symmetral of a compact convex set contains
its Steiner symmetral and is contained in its Minkowski symmetral. We also ﬁnd properties
which ensure that an i-symmetral of a compact convex set contains its inner rotational sym-
metral and is contained in its outer rotational symmetral; see Theorem 7.5. Such results lead
to others concerning the convergence of successive i-symmetrals. For example, Corollary 8.2
gives suﬃcient conditions which guarantee that successive symmetrizations of a convex body
will converge to a ball. No attempt is made in the short Section 8 to obtain the best results
of this type; the topic will be thoroughly investigated in a future paper.

Two characterizations of Minkowski symmetrization are given in Section 9, the highlight
being Theorem 9.2(i), the one mentioned earlier. This follows from Theorem 7.4, which
provides conditions (diﬀerent to those in Corollary 7.3) under which the (n− 1)-symmetral of
a compact convex set is contained in its Minkowski symmetral.
Section 10 focuses on Steiner symmetrization, both on compact sets and on compact convex
sets or convex bodies. Among other results, the characterization of Steiner symmetrization
on convex bodies referred to above may be found in Corollary 10.4.

Throughout the paper, we attempt to provide examples which show that none of our
assumptions can be dropped or signiﬁcantly weakened and succeed in this endeavor when
i = n− 1 (in particular, for the main results mentioned above) and with just three exceptions
otherwise. The ﬁnal Section 11 lists the corresponding open problems. Here too we pose the
intriguing Problem 11.1, part of which asks whether there is a symmetrization on compact
convex sets, which like Minkowski and Steiner symmetrization is monotonic and either in-
variant on H-symmetric cylinders or projection invariant, but which preserves surface area
instead of mean width or volume.

2. Preliminaries

As usual, Sn−1 denotes the unit sphere and o the origin in Euclidean n-space Rn. We assume
throughout that n ≥ 2. The standard orthonormal basis for Rn is {e1, . . . , en}. The unit ball
in Rn will be denoted by Bn. If x, y ∈ Rn we write x · y for the inner product and [x, y] for
the line segment with endpoints x and y. If x ∈ Rn \ {o}, then x⊥ is the (n − 1)-dimensional
subspace orthogonal to x. Throughout the paper, the term subspace means a linear subspace.
If X is a set, we denote by lin X, conv X, cl X, relint X, and dim X the linear hull, convex
hull, closure, relative interior, and dimension (that is, the dimension of the aﬃne hull) of X,
respectively. If H is a subspace of Rn, then X|H is the (orthogonal) projection of X on H
and x|H is the projection of a vector x ∈ Rn on H.

4

GABRIELE BIANCHI, RICHARD J. GARDNER, AND PAOLO GRONCHI

If X and Y are sets in Rn and t ≥ 0, then tX = {tx : x ∈ X} and

X + Y = {x + y : x ∈ X, y ∈ Y }

denotes the Minkowski sum of X and Y .

When H is a ﬁxed subspace of Rn, we use X † for the reﬂection of X in H, i.e., the image
of X under an isometry of Rn that is an involution which ﬁxes each point of H. If X † = X,
we say X is H-symmetric. If H = {o}, we instead write −X = (−1)X for the reﬂection of
X in the origin and o-symmetric for {o}-symmetric. A set X is called rotationally symmetric
with respect to H if for all x ∈ H, X ∩ (H ⊥ + x) = rx(Bn ∩ H ⊥) for some rx ≥ 0.
If
dim H = n − 1, then a compact convex set is rotationally symmetric with respect to H if
and only if it is H-symmetric. The term H-symmetric cylinder will always mean a set of
the form Dr(x) + s(Bn ∩ H ⊥) = Dr(x) × s(Bn ∩ H ⊥), where s > 0 and Dr(x) ⊂ H is the
ball with dim D = dim H, center x, and radius r > 0. Of course, H-symmetric cylinders are
rotationally symmetric with respect to H.

The phrase translate orthogonal to H means translate by a vector in H ⊥.
We write Hk for k-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure in Rn, where k ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
The Grassmannian of k-dimensional subspaces in Rn is denoted by G(n, k).
We denote by Cn the class of nonempty compact subsets of Rn. Let Kn be the class of
nonempty compact convex subsets of Rn and let Kn
n be the class of convex bodies, i.e., members
of Kn with interior points. A subscript s denotes the o-symmetric sets in these classes. If
K ∈ Kn, then

hK(x) = sup{x · y : y ∈ K},

for x ∈ Rn, deﬁnes the support function hK of K. The texts by Gr¨uber [12] and Schneider
[27] contain a wealth of useful information about convex sets and related concepts such as the
intrinsic volumes Vj, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} (see also [8, Appendix A]. In particular, if K ∈ Kn, then
V1(K) and Vn−1(K) are (up to constants independent of K) the mean width and surface area
of K, respectively. If dim K = k, then Vk(K) = Hk(K) and in this case we prefer to write
Vk(K). By κn we denote volume Vn(Bn) of the unit ball in Rn.
If M is an arbitrary subset of R2, we deﬁne the M-sum K ⊕M L of arbitrary sets K and L

in Rn by

(1)

K ⊕M L = {ax + by : x ∈ K, y ∈ L, (a, b) ∈ M}.

See [9] for more information and historical remarks concerning M-addition.

Let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}. If p ∈ Rn, write p = (x, y), where x ∈ H and y ∈ H ⊥
satisfy p = x + y. Suppose that s, t ∈ R and K, L ∈ Kn. The ﬁber combination (s◦ K) C (t◦ L)
of K and L relative to H, deﬁned by

(s ◦ K) C (t ◦ L) = {(x, sy + tz) : (x, y) ∈ K, (x, z) ∈ L},

(2)
was introduced by McMullen [24], who noted that (s◦K)C(t◦L) ∈ Kn, (s◦K)C(t◦L) = sK+tL
if i = 0, and K CH L = K ∩ L if i = n. (We have adapted the deﬁnition in [24] to suit our
purposes.)

3. i-Symmetrization: Properties and known examples

Let i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1} and let H ∈ G(n, i) be ﬁxed. Let B ⊂ Cn be a class of nonempty
compact sets in Rn and let BH denote the subclass of members of B that are H-symmetric.
We call a map ♦ : B → BH an i-symmetrization on B (with respect to H). If K ∈ B, the
corresponding set ♦K is called a symmetral. We consider the following properties, where it is
assumed that the class B is appropriate for the properties concerned and that they hold for
all K, L ∈ B. Recall that K † is the reﬂection of K in H.
(Monotonicity or strict monotonicity) K ⊂ L ⇒ ♦K ⊂ ♦L (or ♦K ⊂ ♦L and
K 6= L ⇒ ♦K 6= ♦L, respectively).
2. (F -preserving) F (♦K) = F (K), where F : B → [0,∞) is a set function. In particular,
we can take F = Vj, j = 1, . . . , n, the jth intrinsic volume, though we generally prefer to write
mean width preserving, surface area preserving, and volume preserving when j = 1, n− 1, and
n, respectively.

8. (Projection covariance)

(♦K)|T = ♦(K|T ) for all nontrivial subspaces T contained in

Invariance under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets is satisﬁed by most
natural symmetrizations, so in discussing examples we shall only mention this property when
it does not hold.

Clearly invariance on H-symmetric sets implies invariance on H-symmetric cylinders and
idempotence. Other less obvious relations between the eight properties are proved in The-
orems 6.1 and 6.3. Projection invariance and projection covariance are really only relevant
when B ⊂ Kn. Other useful properties are considered in [9] but will not be needed here.

Two special cases are of particular importance: i = 0 and i = n − 1.
If i = 0, then H = {o} and 0-symmetrization is the same as the o-symmetrization discussed
in [9]. Note that in this case, the deﬁnition of projection covariance above is consistent with
that used in [9], since H ⊥ = Rn and then (4) is equivalent to (♦K)|T = ♦(K|T ) for all
T ∈ G(n, j), j ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}. Also, when i = 0, the projection invariance property is
trivially satisﬁed.
There are several useful examples of 0-symmetrization, such as pth central symmetrization,

given for K ∈ Kn and p ≥ 1 by

♦K = ∆pK = (cid:0)2−1/pK(cid:1) +p (cid:0)2−1/p(−K)(cid:1) .

Here +p denotes the general Lp addition introduced in [23] (see also [9, Example 6.7] for an
alternative approach), and the nontrivial fact that ∆pK ∈ Kn
s (in particular the convexity of

6

GABRIELE BIANCHI, RICHARD J. GARDNER, AND PAOLO GRONCHI

this set) for K ∈ Kn follows from [9, Theorem 5.1]. The pth central symmetrization is strictly
monotonic, invariant on H-symmetric sets, and projection covariant, as is easily veriﬁed using
the fact that the operation +p is projection covariant as deﬁned in Section 5 below. By
Firey’s inequality [7, (78), p. 394], the jth intrinsic volume is generally increased (meaning
not decreased and not always preserved) by ∆p for j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, except when p = 1, in which
case it is mean width preserving. Except when p = 1, ∆p is not invariant under translations
orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets. When p = 1, the subscript is dropped and

(3)

♦K = ∆K =

(−K)

deﬁnes central symmetrization (see [8, p. 106]). The central symmetral ∆K diﬀers from the
ubiquitous diﬀerence body DK = K + (−K) only by a dilatation factor of 1/2. There are
many other important o-symmetrizations in convex geometry, for example, the projection
body, intersection body, and centroid body operators, usually denoted by ΠK, IK, and ΓK,
respectively. See, for example, [8] and [27, Chapter 10].

The other case of particular importance is i = n − 1. The prime example of an (n − 1)-
symmetrization is Steiner symmetrization. If K ∈ Kn, the Steiner symmetral of K with respect
to H ∈ G(n, n − 1) is the set SHK such that for each line G orthogonal to H and meeting
K, the set G ∩ SH K is a (possibly degenerate) closed line segment with midpoint in H and
length equal to that of G∩ K. In this deﬁnition we have followed [27, p. 536], where the same
deﬁnition is used for compact sets K, with length replaced by H1-measure; see also [8, p. 62]
and [12, p. 169]. On Kn, Steiner symmetrization is strictly monotonic, volume preserving,
invariant on H-symmetric sets, and projection invariant. However, for j ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, it
generally reduces the jth intrinsic volume Vj (see [13, Satz XI, p. 260] or [27, p. 587]), and
it is not projection covariant, since the containment (SHK)|H ⊥ ⊂ SH(K|H ⊥) is in general
proper.
As an example of i-symmetrization, i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 2}, we recall that when K ∈ Kn, the
Schwarz symmetral of K with respect to H ∈ G(n, i) is the set SHK such that for each
(n − i)-dimensional plane G orthogonal to H and meeting K, the set G ∩ SHK is a (pos-
sibly degenerate) (n − i)-dimensional closed ball with center in H and (n − i)-dimensional
volume equal to that of G ∩ K. See [8, p. 62] and also [12, p. 178] (where the process is
referred to as Schwarz rounding). It is convenient to use the same notation for Steiner and
Schwarz symmetrizations. On Kn, Schwarz symmetrization is monotonic, volume preserving,
idempotent, invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, and projection invariant, but not strictly
monotonic, invariant on H-symmetric sets, or projection covariant. (On Kn
n, Schwarz sym-
metrization is strictly monotonic.) Since it can be viewed as a limit of a sequence of Steiner
symmetrizations, Schwarz symmetrization also generally reduces the jth intrinsic volume Vj
for j ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}.

We shall consider Minkowski symmetrization in the following general form. Let i ∈ {1, . . . , n−

where K † is the reﬂection of K in H. (We prefer to exclude the case i = 0, since it corresponds
to K † = −K and MHK = ∆K, the central symmetral.) Minkowski symmetrization is strictly
monotonic, and, since Minkowski addition commutes with projections, K †|H = K|H, and
K †|T = (K|T )† for all subspaces T ⊂ H ⊥, it is projection invariant and projection covariant.
It is clearly also invariant on H-symmetric sets. Since the ﬁrst intrinsic volume V1 is linear
with respect to Minkowski addition, MH is mean width preserving, but for j ∈ {2, . . . , n},
it generally increases the jth intrinsic volume Vj, by the Brunn-Minkowski inequality for
quermassintegrals [7, (74), p. 393] (see also see [13, Satz XI, p. 260]).

There is an extension of Minkowski symmetrization analogous to Schwarz symmetrization
that we shall call Minkowski-Blaschke symmetrization, though it has been referred to by other
names. For example, Bonnesen and Fenchel [4, pp. 79–80] call it stiﬀening and attribute it
to Blaschke [3, p. 137]. If i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 2} and H ∈ G(n, i), the support function hK(v)
of K ∈ Kn at a point v ∈ Sn−1 is replaced by the average of hK over the subsphere of Sn−1
orthogonal to H and containing v. More precisely, if M HK denotes the Minkowski-Blaschke
symmetral of K and u ∈ H ⊥ + x for some x ∈ H, then
(n − i)κn−i ZH ⊥+x

hM H K(u) =

hK(v) dv.

One can check that M H K ∈ Kn and M H K is rotationally symmetric with respect to H.
Minkowski-Blaschke symmetrization is strictly monotonic, mean width preserving, idempo-
tent, invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, and projection invariant, but it is not invariant on
H-symmetric sets or projection covariant.

If H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}, we deﬁne the ﬁber symmetral FH K of K ∈ Kn with

respect to H by

(5)

FHK = (cid:18)1

2 ◦ K(cid:19) CH (cid:18)1

2 ◦ K †(cid:19) ,

where the ﬁber combination is deﬁned by (2). Then FHK = MH K when i = 0 and FH K =
SHK when i = n− 1. The latter was observed by McMullen [24] and for this reason we regard
the ﬁber symmetral as known, though the general deﬁnition (5) does not appear in [24].
Observing that FHK is the compact convex set whose sections orthogonal to H are the
Minkowski symmetrals of the corresponding sections of K, we take the opportunity to gen-
eralize McMullen’s construction, as follows. Let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}, and let
G ∈ G(n, j), j ∈ {n − i, . . . , n}, be contained in H. Let K ∈ Kn and deﬁne FH,GK by

where † denotes reﬂection in H, as usual. Using (6), it is straightforward to show that
FH,GK ∈ Kn and that FH,GK is H-symmetric. Note that FH K = FH,HK. We shall use the

8

same term, ﬁber symmetrization, for the map that takes K to FH,GK. Fiber symmetrization
is strictly monotonic, invariant on H-symmetric sets, and projection invariant, but when i ∈
{1, . . . , n−1} it is not projection covariant, since the containment (FH,GK)|H ⊥ ⊂ FH,G(K|H ⊥)
is in general proper.
Finally, for H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {0, . . . , n−1}, we can deﬁne the Blaschke symmetral of K ∈ Kn

Here ♯ denotes Blaschke addition and K ♯ L is a convex body such that the surface area

When i = 0, we have K † = −K and then the body BHK is often called the Blaschke body
of K and denoted by ∇K; see, for example, [8, p. 116]. Of course, (7) only deﬁnes BHK up
to translation; see [11] for a discussion about the positions for the Blaschke sum chosen in
the literature. We deﬁne the Blaschke sum so that the centroids of BHK and K|H coincide,
in which case BH is invariant on H-symmetric sets. When n = 2, then up to translation
and on Kn
n, BH coincides with ∆ (i = 0) or MH (i = 1), whose properties have already been
discussed. When n = 3, this is not the case and BH is neither monotonic nor (except when
i = 0) projection invariant, regardless of the position chosen for the Blaschke sum, as we show
in the next theorem. Also, projection covariance is not deﬁned since the domain of BH is
Kn
n. Blaschke symmetrization preserves surface area. It is a consequence of the Kneser-S¨uss
inequality [8, (B.32), p. 423], [27, Theorem 8.2.3] that Blaschke symmetrization generally
increases volume.
Theorem 3.1. Let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}. If i = 0, Blaschke symmetrization BH
in Rn, n ≥ 3, is not monotonic and if i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, it is not projection invariant (and
therefore, by Theorem 6.1 below, also not monotonic).

Proof. Let T n be an n-dimensional cone in Rn with centroid at the origin, xn-axis as its axis,
and radius and height (i.e., width in the direction en) both equal to 1. Suppose initially that
i = 0. We claim that when n ≥ 3, the height of BH T n = ∇T n, the Blaschke body of T n,
is less than 1. Suppose the claim is true. Let 0 < s < 1 and let Ls ⊂ T n be the spherical
cylinder with base of radius s contained in the base of T n, the xn-axis as its axis, and with
maximal height w = w(s). The set Ls is centrally symmetric, so BHLs = ∇Ls is a translate
of Ls and the height of ∇Ls is w; since w → 1 as s → 0, when s is suﬃciently small it is not
possible that ∇Ls ⊂ ∇T n. This proves the result when i = 0.
To prove the claim, let n ≥ 3 and recall that the surface area of the curved part of the
boundary of an n-dimensional cone of radius r and height h is rn−2√h2 + r2κn−1. Therefore
the surface area of the curved part of the boundary of T n is √2κn−1, while the area of the
base of T n is κn−1. The surface area measure S(T n,·) consists of a point mass at −en and
a multiple of (n − 2)-dimensional Lebesgue measure on the (n − 2)-dimensional sphere of
latitude in Sn−1 whose points have vertical angle π/4 with the positive xn-axis. From this

and (7) it is easy to see that ∇T n is an o-symmetric truncated double cone of radius a, say,
with the xn-axis as axis, such that the top of ∇T n is an (n− 1)-dimensional ball B of radius h
contained in the plane {xn = a − h}, for some 0 < h < a. By (7), Vn−1(B) = κn−1/2, whence
h = 2−1/(n−1), and the surface area of the curved part of the boundary of ∇T n contained in
{xn ≥ 0} is √2κn−1/2. From the latter we see that

√2an−1κn−1 −

√2hn−1κn−1 = √2κn−1/2

and hence a = 1. Thus the height of ∇T n is 2(a − h) = 2(1 − 2−1/(n−1)), which is less than 1
when n ≥ 3. This proves the claim.
Let i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} and let H be the subspace of Rn spanned by e1, . . . , ei. Identifying
1 with Rn−1 in the natural way, let T n−1 ⊂ e⊥
e⊥
1 be as above, i.e., an (n − 1)-dimensional cone
with the xn-axis as its axis, base an (n − 2)-dimensional ball of radius 1 with center on the
xn-axis, height 1, and centroid at the origin. Let K = [−1/2, 1/2]× T n−1. The cylinder K has
centroid at the origin and is such that K †, the reﬂection of K in H, coincides with −K, so
that BHK = ∇K. (When n = 3, K is a triangular prism with its two triangular facets having
edge lengths √2, √2, and 2.) The set K has four facets: two (n − 1)-dimensional spherical
cylinders with outer unit normals ±en and volume κn−2, and two (n − 1)-dimensional cones
with outer unit normals ±e1 and volume κn−2/(n − 1). By formulas already employed in the
case i = 0, the remaining curved (except when n = 3) part of the boundary of K in {xn ≥ 0}
has (n − 1)-dimensional volume √2κn−2.
From considerations similar to those for the case i = 0, we see that ∇K = [−b/2, b/2] × D,
for some b > 0, where D ⊂ e⊥
1 is an o-symmetric (n − 1)-dimensional double truncated cone
of radius a, say, with the xn-axis as its axis, such that the top of D is an (n − 2)-dimensional
ball B of radius h contained in the plane {xn = a − h}, for some 0 < h < a. The set ∇K
also has four facets: two (n − 1)-dimensional spherical cylinders with outer unit normals ±en
and volume hn−2κn−2b, and two (n − 1)-dimensional double truncated cones with outer unit
normals ±e1 and volume 2(an−1 − hn−1)κn−2/(n − 1). (When n = 3, ∇K is a hexagonal
cylinder with eight facets.) The remaining curved (except when n = 3) part of the boundary
of ∇K in {xn ≥ 0} has (n − 1)-dimensional volume √2(an−2 − hn−2)κn−2b. From these facts
and (7), we obtain hn−2b = 1/2, 2(an−1 − hn−1) = 1, and 2(an−2 − hn−2)b = 1. Solving these
three equations, we ﬁnd that

b = 2− 1

It is not hard to see that b > 1, which implies that the width of ∇K in the direction e1 is
greater than that of K. It follows that (∇K)|H 6= K|H.

It is not possible to generalize the deﬁnitions of MH and BH in a straightforward way to
obtain Vj-preserving symmetrizations for j ∈ {2, . . . , n − 2}. Indeed, by [28, Theorem 3.1], if
j ∈ {2, . . . , n − 2} and K is an n-dimensional convex polytope in Rn such that K and K † do
not have non-trivial faces contained in parallel hyperplanes, then the sum Sj(K,·) + Sj(K †,·)
of the jth area measures of K and K † is not the jth area measure of a compact convex set.
In this connection, see also Problem 11.1.

Table 1 summarizes the properties of the symmetrizations discussed in this section.

4. Projection covariant symmetrizations and M-symmetrization

In this section we discuss projection covariant symmetrizations and introduce a further
process that we call M-symmetrization. We shall need a little terminology from [9]. A binary
operation ∗ : (Kn)2 → Kn is called GL(n) covariant if φ(K ∗ L) = φK ∗ φL for each φ ∈ GL(n)
and all K, L ∈ Kn, and projection covariant if (K ∗ L)|T = (K|T ) ∗ (L|T ) for all K, L ∈ Kn
and T ∈ G(n, j), 1 ≤ j ≤ n − 1. It is monotonic if K ⊂ K ′ and L ⊂ L′ imply K ∗ L ⊂ K ′ ∗ L′
and continuous if Km → M and Lm → N imply Km ∗ Lm → M ∗ N in the Hausdorﬀ metric
as m → ∞, where all sets are in Kn.
Theorem 4.1. Let i ∈ {0, . . . , n− 1}, let H ∈ G(n, i), and let ∗ : (Kn)2 → Kn be commutative
and GL(n) covariant. For c > 0,

♦K = (cK) ∗ (cK †)

(8)
for all K ∈ Kn, deﬁnes an i-symmetrization ♦ : Kn → Kn
H which is also monotonic if ∗
is monotonic. If in addition ∗ is continuous, then ♦ is projection covariant. If ∗ satisﬁes
(cK) ∗ (cK) = K for all K ∈ Kn, then ♦ is invariant on H-symmetric sets.
Proof. Since reﬂection in H is a transformation in GL(n), the commutativity and GL(n)
covariance of ∗ yields

(♦K)† = ((cK) ∗ (cK †))† = (cK)† ∗(cid:0)(cK †)†(cid:1) = (cK)† ∗ (cK) = (cK) ∗ (cK †) = ♦K,

H is an i-symmetrization. It is clear that if ∗ is monotonic, then ♦ is monotonic.

so ♦ : Kn → Kn

SYMMETRIZATION IN GEOMETRY

Suppose that ∗ is also continuous. Then, by [9, Lemma 4.1], ∗ is projection covariant. If T

is a nontrivial subspace contained in H ⊥, this and the commutativity of ∗ imply that

(♦K)|T = ((cK) ∗ (cK †))|T = ((cK)|T ) ∗ ((cK †)|T ) = (c(K|T )) ∗ (c(K|T )†) = ♦(K|T ),

so ♦ is projection covariant.

The last assertion in the statement of the theorem follows immediately from (8).
Let c > 0, let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}, let M ⊂ R2, and for K ∈ Kn, deﬁne

(cid:3)

♦M,cK = (cK) ⊕M (cK †),

(9)
where ⊕M is M-addition, deﬁned by (1). The following lemma will be useful in establishing
the properties of ♦M,c.
Lemma 4.2. Let c > 0, let L ∈ Kn, and let M ∈ K2 be contained in [0,∞)2 and symmetric
with respect to {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 = x2}. If M ⊂ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)], then
(10)
and the converse is true when o /∈ L.
M ∩ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)] 6= ∅.
Proof. We have

If o ∈ L and o ∈ M, then (10) holds if and only if M ⊂ conv {o, (1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)} and

(cL) ⊕M (cL) = L,

Now suppose that o ∈ L and o ∈ M.

(cL) ⊕M (cL) = {acx + bcy : x, y ∈ L, (a, b) ∈ M} = ∪{c(a + b)L : (a, b) ∈ M}.

(11)
Thus M ⊂ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)] implies (cL) ⊕M (cL) = L. To prove the converse when o /∈ L,
we argue by contradiction. Assume that (a, b) ∈ M is such that c(a + b) < 1.
If x ∈ L
has minimum distance from o, then c(a + b)x ∈ ((cL) ⊕M (cL)) \ L, so (10) fails. A similar
argument applied to an x ∈ L of maximal distance from o shows that if (a, b) ∈ M is such
that c(a + b) > 1, then (10) fails. Therefore c(a + b) = 1 for each (a, b) ∈ M, yielding
M ⊂ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)].
If M ⊂ conv {o, (1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)} and M ∩
[(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)] 6= ∅, then we see from (11) that (10) holds. Conversely, assume that (10)
holds and let x ∈ L be of maximal distance from o. If (a, b) ∈ M is such that c(a+b) > 1, then
c(a + b)x ∈ ((cL) ⊕M (cL)) \ L, a contradiction showing that M ⊂ conv {o, (1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)}.
If M ∩ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)] = ∅ then x ∈ L \ ((cL) ⊕M (cL)), again contradicting (10).
Theorem 4.3. Let c > 0, let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1}, and let M ∈ K2 be contained in
[0,∞)2 and symmetric with respect to {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 = x2}.
(i) Equation (9) deﬁnes a monotonic and projection covariant i-symmetrization ♦M,c :
Kn → Kn
H.
(ii) If M ⊂ (0,∞)2, then ♦M,c is strictly monotonic.
(iii) The symmetrization ♦M,c is idempotent if and only if either M ⊂ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)] or

o ∈ M, M ⊂ conv {o, (1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)}, and M ∩ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)] 6= ∅.

(iv) The inclusion M ⊂ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)] is equivalent to any of the following conditions:
♦M,c is invariant on H-symmetric sets, or ♦M,c is invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, or
♦M,c is projection invariant.
(v) The symmetrization ♦M,c is invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric
sets if and only if M ⊂ {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 = x2}.
Proof. (i) By [9, Theorem 6.1(i)], ⊕M : (Kn)2 → Kn if and only if M ∈ K2 and M is contained
in one of the four quadrants of R2. Also, as noted in [9, Section 6], ⊕M is continuous and
GL(n)-covariant and hence projection covariant. Moreover, it follows from the deﬁnition of
⊕M that it is monotonic, and ⊕M is commutative if and only if M is symmetric with respect
to {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 = x2}. Therefore (i) follows directly from Theorem 4.1.

(ii) Let K, L ∈ Kn and let x ∈ Rn. By [9, Theorem 6.5],

hK⊕M L(x) = hM (hK(x), hL(x)),

(12)

implying that

(13)
h♦M,cK(x) = hM (chK(x), chK †(x)).
Suppose that K ⊂ L and K 6= L. There exists z ∈ Rn such that
and hK †(z) ≤ hL†(z).
(14)
Let (a, b) ∈ M be such that

hK(z) < hL(z)

hM (chK(z), chK †(z)) = (a, b) · (chK(z), chK †(z)).

Since a, b > 0, (13) and (14) yield

h♦M,cK(x) = (a, b) · (chK(x), chK †(x)) < (a, b) · (chL(x), chL†(x)) ≤ h♦M,cL(x)

and hence ♦M,cK 6= ♦M,cL.

(iii) Let K ∈ Kn. Since ♦M,cK is H-symmetric, we have

♦2
M,cK = (c♦M,cK) ⊕M (cid:0)c(♦M,cK)†(cid:1) = (c♦M,cK) ⊕M (c♦M,cK).
(15)
If M ⊂ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)], the idempotence of ♦M,c follows from this and Lemma 4.2 with
L = ♦M,cK.
If o ∈ M, M ⊂ conv {o, (1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)}, and M ∩ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)] 6= ∅,
then o ∈ ♦M,cK and again the idempotence of ♦M,c follows from (15) and Lemma 4.2 with
L = ♦M,cK. To prove the converse, suppose that ♦M,c is idempotent. If o /∈ ♦M,cK for some
K ∈ Kn, then M ⊂ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)], by Lemma 4.2 with L = ♦M,cK. Otherwise, we have
o ∈ ♦M,cK for all K ∈ Kn. We claim that o ∈ M. Indeed, suppose on the contrary that
d = min{a + b : (a, b) ∈ M} > 0. If H = lin{e1, . . . , ei} and K ⊂ {x ∈ Rn : x · e1 ≥ 1}, then
K † ⊂ {x ∈ Rn : x · e1 ≥ 1}. Then for each x ∈ K, y ∈ K †, and (a, b) ∈ M, we have

c(ax + by) · e1 ≥ c(a + b) ≥ cd.

Therefore ♦M,cK ⊂ {x ∈ Rn : x · e1 ≥ cd}, which since cd > 0 contradicts o ∈ ♦M,cK
and proves the claim. Now since o ∈ M, Lemma 4.2 with L = ♦M,cK implies that M ⊂
conv {o, (1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)} and M ∩ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)] 6= ∅.

SYMMETRIZATION IN GEOMETRY

13

(iv) Suppose that M ⊂ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)]. If K is an H-symmetric set, then

♦M,cK = (cK) ⊕M (cK †) = (cK) ⊕M (cK).

Then Lemma 4.2 with L = K yields ♦M,cK = K. Therefore ♦M,c is invariant on H-symmetric
sets and hence also on H-symmetric cylinders. Now suppose that ♦M,c is invariant on H-
symmetric cylinders. Let K be an H-symmetric cylinder such that o 6∈ K. Then (10) holds
with L = K and Lemma 4.2 implies that M ⊂ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)]. It remains to prove (iv) for
projection invariance, which follows easily from similar arguments and the formulas

(cid:0)(cK) ⊕M (cK †)(cid:1)|H = (cK|H) ⊕M (cid:0)cK †|H(cid:1) = (cK|H) ⊕M (cK|H) .

(v) If M ⊂ {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 = x2}, then hM is constant on each line orthogonal to
{(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 = x2}. Therefore, if K ∈ Kn is an H-symmetric set and y ∈ H ⊥, by (12)
we have

(16)

h♦M,c(K+y)(x) = hM (chK+y(x), ch(K+y)†(x))

= hM (chK(x) + cy · x, chK(x) − cy · x)
= hM (chK(x), chK(x)) = h♦M,cK(x).

Thus ♦M,c is invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets. Conversely,
suppose that ♦M,c is invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets. Let
x ∈ Rn \ (cid:0)H ∪ H ⊥(cid:1) and let K be a ball with center in H, supported by x⊥ and contained
in {y ∈ Rn : y · x ≤ 0}. Then hK(x) = 0. Choosing y ∈ H ⊥ such that x · y = ±1/c
and substituting into (16), we conclude that hM (1,−1) = hM (−1, 1) = 0 and hence that
M ⊂ {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 = x2}.

(cid:3)

We call an i-symmetrization ♦M,c, deﬁned by (9) with c and M satisfying the hypotheses
of Theorem 4.3, an M-symmetrization. Examples include Minkowski symmetrization (when
⊕M = + and c = 1/2) and pth central symmetrization (when i = 0, ⊕M = +p, and c = 2−1/p).
Before discussing others, we present the following result concerning projection covariant i-
symmetrizations, which shows that they are somewhat special and explains their limited role
in this paper. The proof is essentially the same as that of [9, Theorem 8.2], which establishes
the case i = 0.
Proposition 4.4. Let i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 2}, let H ∈ G(n, i), and let ♦ : Kn → Kn
H be an
i-symmetrization. If ♦ is projection covariant, then there is a compact convex set M in R2,
symmetric with respect to {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 = x2}, such that
h♦K(x) = hM (hK(x), hK(−x))
(17)
for all K ∈ Kn and x ∈ H ⊥.
Proof. Suppose that ♦ is projection covariant. Without loss of generality, we may assume
that H ⊥ = lin{e1, . . . , en−i} and H = lin{en−i+1, . . . , en}. Since n − i ≥ 2, the proof of [9,
Theorem 8.2] can be followed, identifying H ⊥ with Rn in that proof in the natural way, leading
to (17).
(cid:3)

GABRIELE BIANCHI, RICHARD J. GARDNER, AND PAOLO GRONCHI

When M = {(1/2, 1/2)}, for example, (17) is equivalent to
hK(−x)

h♦K(x) =

hK(x) +

for all K ∈ Kn and x ∈ H ⊥. Then ♦K is just the central symmetral ∆K when i = 0.
The converse of Proposition 4.4 holds when i = 0 or if it is assumed in addition to (17) that
K ⊂ H ⊥ implies that ♦K ⊂ H ⊥, but in general it is false. For example, let i ∈ {1, . . . , n− 2}
and let ♦K = MH K + (Bn ∩ H) for all K ∈ Kn, as in Example 5.5 below. Then (17)
holds with M = {(1/2, 1/2)}, since if x ∈ H ⊥, then hK †(x) = hK(−x) and hBn∩H(x) = 0.
However, ♦ is not projection covariant, since if T is a nontrivial subspace contained in H ⊥,
then (♦Bn)|T = Bn|T , but

♦(Bn|T ) = (Bn|T ) + (Bn ∩ H).

We warn the reader that the right-hand side of (17) does not necessarily deﬁne a support
function, even when i = 0 and M is the unit ball in l2
p with p > 1; see [9, p. 2334]. Despite
this, if in (17) we take i = 0 and M to be the part of the unit ball in l2
p′ in [0,∞)2, where
1/p + 1/p′ = 1 and p > 1, then ♦K = ∆pK; see [9, Example 6.7].
We now consider other possibilities for M-symmetrizations. If M ⊂ [(1/c, 0), (0, 1/c)], then
by Theorem 4.3(iv), ♦M,c is invariant on H-symmetric sets and projection invariant. When
c = 1 and M = {(1/2, 1/2)}, we retrieve Minkowski symmetrization as in (4). On the other
hand, if we take c = 1 and M = [(1, 0), (0, 1)], then

♦M,1K = ∪{(1 − t)x + ty : x ∈ K, y ∈ K †, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1} = conv (K ∪ K †),

as in Example 5.11(ii) below. A further choice for M provides Example 5.16 below. These
examples will ﬁnd use in Section 7.

5. Further examples of symmetrizations

In this section we collect some further examples of symmetrizations that will be needed

later.

Firstly, we introduce two new generalizations of Steiner and Minkowski symmetrization. Let
H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {1, . . . , n−1}. If K ∈ Kn, we deﬁne the inner rotational symmetral IH K to be
the set such that for each (n− i)-dimensional plane G orthogonal to H and meeting K, the set
G∩IHK is a (possibly degenerate) (n−i)-dimensional ball with center in H and radius equal to
that of the (possibly degenerate) largest (n−i)-dimensional ball contained in G∩K. It is easy
to check that IHK is a compact convex set such that IH K ⊂ SHK, the Schwarz symmetral
of K. If i = n − 1, then of course IHK = SH K, the Steiner symmetral. The symmetrization
IH is monotonic, idempotent, invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, and projection invariant,
but not strictly monotonic or invariant on H-symmetric sets. The inclusion IHK ⊂ SH K,
which in general is strict unless i = n− 1, and the fact that SH is Vn-preserving and generally
reduces Vj for j ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, imply that IH generally reduces Vj for j ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}
and also for j = n when i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 2}.

SYMMETRIZATION IN GEOMETRY

15

When K is a convex body, IHK can also be viewed as the closure of the union of all H-
symmetric cylinders that have a translate orthogonal to H contained in K. It is rotationally
symmetric with respect to H.

For K ∈ Kn, we deﬁne the outer rotational symmetral OHK to be the intersection of all
rotationally symmetric convex bodies for which some translate orthogonal to H contains K.
The inclusion MH K ⊂ OHK holds, as can be seen by taking ♦ = MH in Theorem 7.5 below.
If i = n − 1, then OHK = MHK, the Minkowski symmetral. This can be deduced by taking
♦ = OH and i = n − 1 in Corollary 7.3. The symmetrization OH is strictly monotonic,
idempotent, and invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, but not invariant on H-symmetric sets
unless i = n − 1. That it is also projection invariant can be seen by noting that for each
K ∈ Kn and suitably large r > 0, the set L = (K|H)× r(Bn ∩ H ⊥) is a rotationally invariant
compact convex set with K ⊂ L and L|H = K|H. The inclusion MH K ⊂ OHK, which in
general is strict unless i = n− 1, and the fact that MH is V1-preserving and generally increases
Vj for j ∈ {2, . . . , n}, imply that OH generally increases Vj for j ∈ {2, . . . , n} and also for
j = 1 when i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 2}.
We present some examples that will be useful in showing that the various assumptions in
our results cannot be omitted. (See Section 10 for a few further examples needed only there.)
For Example 5.12, we shall need the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1. Let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, and let K ∈ Kn. Deﬁne LK = conv (K ∪
(K|H)), where K is the (possibly empty) closure of the union of all H-symmetric cylinders
contained in K. Then for j ∈ {1, . . . , n},
(18)
Proof. From the deﬁnitions of LK and IHK, we have K|H ⊂ LK ⊂ IHK. Then (18) follows,
since Vj is an increasing set function and IH does not increase Vj.

Vj(K|H) ≤ Vj(LK) ≤ Vj(K).

(cid:3)

In Examples 5.2–5.13 below, we assume that H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {1, . . . , n− 1}, and B = Kn or
B = Kn
n, and discuss the properties of the symmetrizations deﬁned. All symmetrizations are
invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets unless it is stated otherwise.
We omit mention of projection covariance since it will not be needed for the rest of the paper.
Example 5.2. For all K ∈ B, let ♦K be the smallest H-symmetric cylinder such that some
translate orthogonal to H contains K. Then ♦ : B → BH is monotonic, idempotent, and
invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, but not strictly monotonic or invariant on H-symmetric
sets. Also, ♦ is projection invariant if and only if i = 1.
(cid:3)
Example 5.3. For all K ∈ B, let xK and yK be the centroids of K|H and K|H ⊥, respectively.
Let rK, sK ≥ 0 be the largest numbers such that DK = rK(Bn ∩ H) + xK ⊂ K|H and
EK = sK(Bn ∩ H ⊥) + yK ⊂ K|H ⊥. Deﬁne ♦K = DK + EK. Then ♦ : B → BH is idempotent
and invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, but not monotonic or invariant on H-symmetric sets.
Also, ♦ is projection invariant if and only if i = 1.
(cid:3)
Example 5.4. For all K ∈ B, let ♦K = MHK + Vn(K△K ‡)Bn, where △ denotes the
symmetric diﬀerence and K ‡ is the reﬂection of K in the translate of H containing the centroid

16

of K. Then ♦ : B → BH is invariant on H-symmetric sets but not projection invariant and
hence, by Theorem 6.1 below, not monotonic either (as is also not hard to see directly). (cid:3)
Example 5.5. For all K ∈ B, let ♦K = MH K + (Bn ∩ H ⊥). Then ♦ : B → BH is
strictly monotonic and projection invariant, but not idempotent or invariant on H-symmetric
cylinders.
(cid:3)
Example 5.6. For all K ∈ B, let CK be the smallest H-symmetric cylinder such that some
translate orthogonal to H contains K (i.e., CK is the symmetral from Example 5.2) and
deﬁne ♦K = (1/2)OHK + (1/2)CK, where OHK is the outer rotational symmetral of K.
Then ♦ : B → BH is strictly monotonic and invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, but not
idempotent or invariant on H-symmetric sets. Also, ♦ is projection invariant if and only if
i = 1.
Example 5.7. For all K ∈ B, let ♦K = (K|H)+(Bn∩H ⊥). Then ♦ : B → BH is monotonic,
idempotent, and projection invariant, but not strictly monotonic or invariant on H-symmetric
cylinders.
(cid:3)
Example 5.8. For all K ∈ B, let dK be the distance between K and H. For a ≥ 0, let
φa : Rn → Rn be deﬁned by φa(x + y) = x + ay, where x ∈ H and y ∈ H ⊥. Deﬁne
♦ : B → BH by ♦K = φe−dK SHK. It is easy to check that ♦ is strictly monotonic, invariant
on H-symmetric sets, and projection invariant, but not invariant under translations orthogonal
to H of H-symmetric sets.
Example 5.9. For all K ∈ B, deﬁne ♦ : B → BH by ♦K = φe−Vn(K△K‡ )SHK, where K△K ‡
and φa, a ∈ R, are as in Examples 5.4 and 5.8, respectively. Then ♦ is invariant on H-
symmetric sets and projection invariant, but not monotonic.
Example 5.10. Let j ∈ {1, . . . , n}. For all K ∈ B, let ♦K = tKBn, where tK ≥ 0 is chosen
so that Vj(♦K) = Vj(K). Then ♦ : B → BH is monotonic (strictly monotonic if and only if
B = Kn
n or j = 1), Vj-preserving, and idempotent, but not invariant on H-symmetric cylinders
or projection invariant.
(cid:3)

(cid:3)

Example 5.11. Either deﬁne

(i) ♦K = conv ((K ∩ K †) ∪ (K|H)) for all K ∈ B, or
(ii) ♦K = conv (K ∪ K †) for all K ∈ B.
Then ♦ : B → BH is monotonic and invariant on H-symmetric sets (and therefore projection
invariant, by Theorem 6.1 below), but not strictly monotonic, Vj-preserving for any j ∈
{1, . . . , n}, or invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets.
Example 5.12. Let j ∈ {1, . . . , n}. For K ∈ B, deﬁne LK = conv (K ∪ (K|H)), where K is
the (possibly empty) closure of the union of all H-symmetric cylinders contained in K. By
(18), we may choose tK ≥ 0 such that Vj(LK + tK(Bn ∩ H ⊥)) = Vj(K) and deﬁne

(cid:3)

♦K = LK + tK(Bn ∩ H ⊥) = conv (K ∪ (K|H)) + tK(Bn ∩ H ⊥)).

If B = Kn
n, then clearly dim♦K = dim LK = n when K 6= ∅. If K = ∅, then LK = K|H and
Vj(K) > Vj(LK); then tK > 0 and again we have dim♦K = n. Hence ♦ : B → BH . Then ♦

SYMMETRIZATION IN GEOMETRY

is idempotent, Vj-preserving, invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, and projection invariant.
However, ♦ is not monotonic, at least when j = 1 and j = n; this is a consequence of
Theorem 9.2 and Corollary 10.4 below, respectively, but it is easy to check, for example, that
if K = [0, 1]×[1, 2] and L = conv (K∪{(2, 1)}), then ♦K 6⊂ ♦L. Also, ♦ is neither invariant on
H-symmetric sets nor invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets. (cid:3)
Example 5.13. Let j ∈ {1, . . . , n − i} and let L ∈ Kn
s satisfy L ⊂ H ⊥ and Vj(L) > 0. For
K ∈ B, deﬁne
where rx ≥ 0 is chosen so that

♦K = ∪{rxL + x : x ∈ K|H},
Vj(rxL) = Vj (cid:0)K ∩ (H ⊥ + x)(cid:1)

n

for all x ∈ K|H. Then the Brunn-Minkowski inequality for quermassintegrals [7, (74), p. 393]
implies that ♦ : B → BH is an i-symmetrization. If i = n−1, then ♦ is Steiner symmetrization
and if i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 2}, j = n − i, and L = Bn ∩ H ⊥, then ♦ is Schwarz symmetrization.
Moreover, if i ∈ {1, . . . , n− 2}, then ♦ is monotonic (strictly monotonic if and only if B = Kn
or j = 1), volume preserving if j = n − i, idempotent, and projection invariant, but not
invariant on H-symmetric cylinders unless L = Bn ∩ H ⊥ and not invariant on H-symmetric
sets.
Example 5.14. Let j ∈ {1, . . . , n− 1} and let K ∈ B. If K = L + y, where L is H-symmetric
and y ∈ H ⊥, then deﬁne ♦K = L. Otherwise, deﬁne ♦K = tKBn, where tK ≥ 0 is chosen
so that Vj(♦K) = Vj(K). Then ♦ : B → BH is Vj-preserving and invariant on H-symmetric
sets, but not monotonic or projection invariant.
Example 5.15. Let j ∈ {1, . . . , n−1}. For all K ∈ B, let xK be the centroid of K|H. Choose
rK ≥ 0 such that CK = conv ((K|H) ∪ (rK(Bn ∩ H ⊥) + xK)) satisﬁes Vj(CK) = Vj(K), and
deﬁne ♦K = CK. Then ♦ : B → BH is Vj-preserving, idempotent, and projection invariant,
but not monotonic or invariant on H-symmetric cylinders.
Example 5.16. Let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, and let B = Kn or B = Kn
n. Deﬁne
♦ : B → BH by (9) with c = 1 and M = [(1/4, 3/4), (3/4, 1/4)]. Theorem 4.3 implies that
this deﬁnition is valid and that ♦ is strictly monotonic, invariant on H-symmetric sets, and
projection invariant, but not invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric
sets.

Table 2 summarizes the properties (other than projection covariance, which is irrelevant for
the sequel) of symmetrizations in this section. For simplicity a few special cases are ignored;
for example, the symmetrizations in Examples 5.10 and 5.13 are strictly monotonic when
j = 1.

6. Relations between properties

It was noted above that invariance on H-symmetric sets implies invariance on H-symmetric
cylinders and idempotence. In this section we establish some less obvious relations between
the properties considered in Section 3.

Note that the conclusion in the following result holds trivially when i = 0.

that ♦ : B → BH is monotonic and either

n. Suppose

(i) i = 1 and ♦ is invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, or

R0 > 0 such that L = (K|H) + (R0Bn ∩ H ⊥) contains K. Then L ∈ B and L† = L. Also, L
is an H-symmetric set and if i = 1, then L is an H-symmetric cylinder. Our assumptions in

(i) and (ii) imply that ♦L = L. The monotonicity of ♦ yields ♦K ⊂ ♦L, so

(♦K)|H ⊂ (♦L)|H = L|H = K|H.

To prove the opposite containment, suppose to the contrary that there is a ball B with
dim B = dim(K|H) such that B ⊂ (K|H) \ ((♦K)|H). Choose R1 > 0 such that if M =
B + (R1Bn ∩ H ⊥), then K ∩ (B × H ⊥) ⊂ M. Since K ∩ M ∈ B, M ∈ B, and M † = M, the
monotonicity of ♦ and its invariance on H-symmetric cylinders imply that ♦(K∩M) ⊂ ♦M =
M and hence (♦(K ∩ M))|H ⊂ M|H = B. From K ∩ M 6= ∅ we conclude that ♦(K ∩ M) 6= ∅
and thus (♦(K ∩ M))|H 6= ∅. The inclusion K ∩ M ⊂ K gives (♦(K ∩ M))|H ⊂ (♦K)|H.
Consequently, B ∩ ((♦K)|H) 6= ∅. This contradiction shows that K|H ⊂ (♦K)|H. Therefore
(♦K)|H = K|H and ♦ is projection invariant.

(cid:3)

The proof of the previous theorem shows that in (ii) it is only necessary to assume that ♦
is invariant on sets of the form (K|H) + s(Bn ∩ H ⊥), where K ∈ B and s > 0. The latter
assumption is still stronger than invariance on H-symmetric cylinders, which Example 5.2
shows does not suﬃce. Examples 5.4 and 5.10 show that the other assumptions cannot be
omitted and Example 5.5 shows that the converse of Theorem 6.1 is false in the sense that
projection invariance does not imply invariance on H-symmetric cylinders in the presence of
monotonicity.

Next, we focus on the idempotent property.

Lemma 6.2. Let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, and let B ⊂ Cn. Suppose that ♦ : B → BH
is strictly monotonic and idempotent. If K ∈ B and either ♦K ⊂ K or ♦K ⊃ K, then
♦K = K.
Proof. If K ∈ B and the inclusion ♦K ⊂ K is proper, then so is the inclusion ♦2K ⊂ ♦K,
by the strict monotonicity of ♦. This contradicts the equality ♦2K = ♦K provided by the
idempotence of ♦. A similar argument applies when the inclusion ♦K ⊃ K holds.
Theorem 6.3. Let H ∈ G(n, n − 1) and let B = Kn or B = Kn
strictly monotonic and idempotent. The following are equivalent:

n. Suppose that ♦ : B → BH is

(cid:3)

(i) ♦ is invariant on H-symmetric sets;
(ii) ♦ is invariant on H-symmetric cylinders;
(iii) ♦ is projection invariant.

Proof. The implication (i)⇒(iii) holds by Theorem 6.1.
(iii)⇒(ii) Let K be an H-symmetric cylinder. If ♦K ⊂ K or ♦K ⊃ K, then ♦K = K by
Lemma 6.2. Otherwise, since dim H = n− 1, there is an x ∈ relint K|H = relint (♦K)|H such
that (♦K)∩(H ⊥ +x) is properly contained in K∩(H ⊥ +x). We may then choose r > 0 so that
(♦K)∩ Cr(x) is properly contained in K ∩ Cr(x), where Cr(x) = Dr(x)× H ⊥ and Dr(x) ⊂ H
is the (n− 1)-dimensional ball with center x and radius r > 0. The monotonicity of ♦ implies
that ♦(K ∩ Cr(x)) ⊂ ♦K and the projection invariance of ♦ yields ♦(K ∩ Cr(x)) ⊂ Cr(x).
Therefore ♦(K∩Cr(x)) ⊂ (♦K)∩Cr(x) and it follows that ♦(K∩Cr(x)) is properly contained
in K ∩ Cr(x). This contradicts Lemma 6.2, applied to the set K ∩ Cr(x).

20

(ii)⇒(i) Assume that K ∈ B is an H-symmetric set and initially also that dim K = n. If
L is an H-symmetric cylinder with L ⊂ K, then L = ♦L ⊂ ♦K. Since dim H = n − 1 and
dim K = n, it is easy to see that K is the closure of the union of the H-symmetric cylinders
contained in it. Consequently, K ⊂ ♦K and it follows from Lemma 6.2 that ♦K = K.
Now assume that K is an H-symmetric set and dim K < n. For each ε > 0, K + εBn
is H-symmetric and dim(K + εBn) = n, so ♦K ⊂ ♦(K + εBn) = K + εBn. Since K =
∩{K + εBn : ε > 0}, this shows that ♦K ⊂ K and we conclude that ♦K = K as before. (cid:3)
Assuming i = n − 1, Examples 5.2, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, and 5.10 with j = 1 show that neither
(ii)⇒(iii) nor (iii)⇒(ii) holds if any of the assumptions in Theorem 6.3 (strict monotonicity,
idempotence, and either invariance on H-symmetric cylinders or projection invariance) is
omitted or strict monotonicity is weakened to monotonicity. Since (i)⇒(ii) is always true by
the deﬁnitions and (i)⇒(iii) holds in the presence of monotonicity alone by Theorem 6.1, no
other implications need be considered. That the restriction dim H = n− 1 cannot be dropped
in (iii)⇒(ii) is shown by Example 5.13 with j = 1 and L 6= Bn ∩ H ⊥, while outer rotational
symmetrization serves the same purpose for (iii)⇒(i) and (ii)⇒(i). We do not have an example
to show that the assumption dim H = n − 1 is needed in (ii)⇒(iii); see Problem 11.2.
The next lemma will allow us to prove Theorem 6.5, a variant of Theorem 6.3 that achieves
the same conclusion with diﬀerent assumptions.
Lemma 6.4. Let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, let B = Kn or B = Kn
n, and let F : B →
[0,∞) be a strictly increasing set function invariant under translations orthogonal to H of
H-symmetric sets. Suppose that ♦ : B → BH is monotonic and F -preserving. If K ∈ B is H-
symmetric and either ♦(K + y) ⊂ K or ♦(K + y) ⊃ K for some y ∈ H ⊥, then ♦(K + y) = K.
Proof. If K ∈ B is H-symmetric, y ∈ H ⊥, and ♦(K + y) is a proper subset of K, then since F
is strictly increasing, F (♦(K + y)) < F (K). But F (♦(K + y)) = F (K + y) = F (K), because
♦ is F -preserving and invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets. A
similar contradiction is reached if K is a proper subset of ♦(K + y).
Theorem 6.5. Let H ∈ G(n, n − 1), let B = Kn or B = Kn
n, and let F : B → [0,∞) be a
strictly increasing set function. If ♦ : B → BH is monotonic and F -preserving, the following
are equivalent:

(cid:3)

(i) ♦ is invariant on H-symmetric sets;
(ii) ♦ is invariant on H-symmetric cylinders;
(iii) ♦ is projection invariant.

Proof. Note ﬁrstly that when y = o, the assumption that ♦ is invariant under translations
orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets is not needed in Lemma 6.2. Therefore to prove the
equivalence of the conditions (i)–(iii), we can follow the proof of Theorem 6.3, using Lemma 6.4
with y = o to replace Lemma 6.2, since this proof does not otherwise require the strict
monotonicity or idempotence of ♦.
(cid:3)

Assuming i = n−1 and taking F = V1, Examples 5.5, 5.6, 5.10 with j = 1, and 5.15, together
with Blaschke symmetrization with F = Vn−1, show that neither (ii)⇒(iii) nor (iii)⇒(ii)

SYMMETRIZATION IN GEOMETRY

21

holds if any of the three other assumptions is omitted or strict monotonicity is weakened to
monotonicity. Examples 5.2 and 5.7 with F (K) = V1(♦K) show that it does not suﬃce to
assume that F is merely increasing. That the restriction dim H = n− 1 cannot be dropped in
(iii)⇒(ii) is shown by Example 5.13 with F = Vn−i, j = 1, and L 6= Bn ∩ H ⊥, while Schwarz
symmetrization with F = Vn serves the same purpose for (iii)⇒(i) and (ii)⇒(i). We do not
have an example to show that the assumption dim H = n − 1 is needed in (ii)⇒(iii); see
Problem 11.3.

7. The role of Steiner and Minkowski symmetrization

We now present some expressions for the Steiner and Minkowski symmetrals that shed light

Ky = K + y and K †

on the relationship between them and which will ﬁnd use in the sequel.
Theorem 7.1. Let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, and for K ∈ Kn and y ∈ H ⊥, let
(19)
Then for K ∈ Kn, we have
(20)
if i = n − 1, and
(21)
Proof. If i = n − 1 and x ∈ H, let yx ∈ H ⊥ be such that x − yx is the midpoint of the line
segment K∩(H ⊥ +x). Then Kyx ∩(H ⊥ +x) ⊂ Kyx ∩K †
yx. Since the latter set is H-symmetric,
it follows that (SHK) ∩ (H ⊥ + x) ⊂ Kyx ∩ K †
y). The
reverse inclusion holds because
y = SH (Ky ∩ K †

yx and hence SH K ⊂ ∪y∈H ⊥ (Ky ∩ K †

MHK = ∩y∈H ⊥ conv (Ky ∪ K †

Corollary 7.2. If H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} and K ∈ Kn, then SHK is the union of all
H-symmetric compact convex sets such that some translate orthogonal to H is contained in
K, if i = n − 1, and MH K is the intersection of all H-symmetric compact convex sets such
that some translate orthogonal to H contains K.
Proof. For each y ∈ H ⊥, the sets Ky∩K †
y) deﬁned via (19) are H-symmetric.
It remains to observe that if L ∈ Kn is H-symmetric and L + z ⊂ K (or L + z ⊃ K) for some
z ∈ H ⊥, then L ⊂ K−z ∩ K †

−z (or L ⊃ conv (K−z ∩ K †

y and conv (Ky∪K †

−z), respectively).

By Theorem 6.3, when i = n − 1 the hypotheses of the following corollary hold if the
assumption that ♦ is monotonic and invariant under H-symmetric sets is replaced by the
assumption that ♦ is strictly monotonic, idempotent, and either invariant on H-symmetric
cylinders or projection invariant.
Corollary 7.3. Let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {1, . . . , n− 1}, and let B = Kn or B = Kn
n. Suppose that
♦ : B → BH is monotonic, invariant on H-symmetric sets, and invariant under translations
orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets. In the expression
SHK ⊂ ♦K ⊂ MHK,

(23)
the left-hand inclusion holds for all K ∈ B when i = n−1 and the right-hand inclusion without
restriction.
Proof. Let K ∈ B and let y ∈ H ⊥. The sets Ky ∩ K †
are H-symmetric and K ⊂ conv (Ky ∪ K †
property of ♦, we obtain
(24)

y) deﬁned via (19)
y)− y. Hence, using the monotonicity and invariance

y) ⊂ ♦Ky = ♦K

and

(25)

♦K ⊂ ♦(cid:0)conv (Ky ∪ K †

y) − y(cid:1) = ♦conv (Ky ∪ K †

Then (23) follows immediately from (20), (21), (24), and (25).

y) = conv (Ky ∪ K †
y).

(cid:3)

The containment SHK ⊂ MH K when i = n − 1 is both well known and rather obvious
geometrically, but nevertheless has been found useful in proving results on the convergence of
successive Steiner symmetrals; see, for example, [5] and the references given there.

The restriction to i = n − 1 cannot be dropped in obtaining the inclusion SHK ⊂ ♦K,
since it is not true that for i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 2} and H ∈ G(n, i), we have SH K ⊂ MH K,
Indeed, if H = lin{e1, . . . , ei}, a > 0, and
where SH K is the Schwarz symmetral of K.
K = [−1, 1]n−1 × [−a, a], then MHK = K and SHK is a cylinder with radius r satisfying
κn−irn−i = 2n−ia. Thus if a < (2n−i/κn−i)1/(n−i−1), then r > a and SHK 6⊂ MH K.
Examples 5.8, 5.9, and 5.10 with j = 1 show that none of the other assumptions can be
omitted in obtaining the inclusion SHK ⊂ ♦K. Examples 5.4, 5.5, and 5.16 show that none
of the assumptions can be omitted in obtaining the inclusion ♦K ⊂ MH K.
The ﬁber symmetrizations FH,G satisfy the hypotheses of Corollary 7.3. Another such
family of symmetrizations is given by ♦t,J K = ((1 − t) ◦ SHK) CJ (t ◦ MH K) for K ∈ Kn and

SYMMETRIZATION IN GEOMETRY

23

0 ≤ t ≤ 1, where dim J ∈ {0, . . . , n} and J ⊂ H or J ⊃ H. Further examples can be obtained
by concatenating these symmetrizations for diﬀerent t and J.

strictly increasing set function invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric
If ♦ : B → BH is monotonic, F -preserving, and either invariant on H-symmetric
sets.
cylinders or projection invariant, then ♦ is invariant under translations orthogonal to H of
H-symmetric sets and

SHK ⊂ ♦K ⊂ MH K

(26)
for all K ∈ B.
Proof. By Theorem 6.5, ♦ is invariant on H-symmetric sets. Then (26) will follow from
Corollary 7.3 if we can show that ♦ is invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-
symmetric sets. To this end, let K ∈ B be H-symmetric and let y ∈ H ⊥. The desired
conclusion that ♦(K + y) = ♦K will follow if we show that ♦(K + y) = K.
Suppose that ♦(K + y) 6= K. By Theorem 6.1, ♦ is projection invariant. Assuming
dim K = n, it follows from Lemma 6.4 that there is an x ∈ relint K|H = relint (♦K)|H such
that (♦(K + y))∩ (H ⊥ + x) is properly contained in K ∩ (H ⊥ + x). We may then choose r > 0
so that (♦(K + y)) ∩ Cr(x) is properly contained in K ∩ Cr(x), where Cr(x) = Dr(x) × H ⊥
and Dr(x) ⊂ H is the i-dimensional ball with center x and radius r > 0. By the monotonicity
and projection invariance of ♦, we have

♦((K ∩ Cr(x)) + y) = ♦((K + y) ∩ Cr(x)) ⊂ (♦(K + y)) ∩ Cr(x),

and hence ♦((K∩Cr(x))+y) is properly contained in K∩Cr(x). This contradicts Lemma 6.4,
applied to the set K ∩ Cr(x).
Now suppose that dim K < n. By the monotonicity of ♦ and the above, for each ε > 0 we
have

♦(K + y) ⊂ ♦(K + εBn + y) = ♦(K + εBn) = K + εBn,

which implies that ♦(K + y) ⊂ K and hence, by Lemma 6.4 again, that ♦(K + y) = ♦K. (cid:3)
The restriction to i = n− 1 cannot be dropped in obtaining either inclusion in (26). Indeed,
we may take ♦ = SH, Schwarz symmetrization, and F = Vn, but we showed after Corollary 7.3
that for i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 2} and H ∈ G(n, i), it is not generally true that SHK ⊂ MH K. A
similar conclusion is reached by taking ♦ = M H, Minkowski-Blaschke symmetrization, and
F = V1.
Examples 5.10, 5.11(i) and (ii), and 5.12 with j = 1 or j = n show that none of the other

assumptions can be omitted in obtaining the inclusions in (26).

be invariant on H-symmetric cylinders and invariant under translations orthogonal to H of
H-symmetric sets. In the expression

the left-hand inclusion (or right-hand inclusion) holds for all K ∈ B if B = Kn
monotonic (or if ♦ is also strictly monotonic and idempotent, respectively).
Proof. Suppose that ♦ is invariant on H-symmetric cylinders and invariant under translations
orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets. Let K ∈ Kn
n. Assume ♦ is also monotonic. Let L be
an H-symmetric cylinder such that L + y ⊂ K for some y ∈ H ⊥. Then

n and ♦ is also

L = ♦L = ♦(L + y) ⊂ ♦K.

Since IHK is the closure of the union of such sets L, the left-hand inclusion in (27) follows.
Now assume instead that ♦ is also strictly monotonic and idempotent. Let K ∈ Kn and let
C be a rotationally invariant convex body such that K ⊂ C + y for some y ∈ H ⊥. If L is an
H-symmetric cylinder with L ⊂ C, then L = ♦L ⊂ ♦C. Since C is the closure of the union
of all such sets L, we have C ⊂ ♦C and hence ♦C = C by Lemma 6.2. Therefore

♦K ⊂ ♦(C + y) = ♦C = C.

The right-hand inclusion in (27) now follows from the deﬁnition of OHK.

(cid:3)

The assumption B = Kn

n, and 5.10 with B = Kn

n cannot be omitted in obtaining the inclusion IHK ⊂ ♦K, as can
be seen by deﬁning ♦ : Kn → Kn
H by ♦K = IH K if dim K = n and ♦K = K|H otherwise.
Examples 5.3, 5.8 with B = Kn
n and j = 1 show that none of the other
assumptions can be omitted either. Examples 5.2, 5.6, 5.10 with j = 1, and 5.16 serve the
same purpose for the inclusion ♦K ⊂ OHK.
Note that we may take ♦ = SH, Schwarz symmetrization, in the previous theorem. Other
symmetrizations satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 7.5 are the ﬁber symmetrizations FH,G
or those given by ♦t,J K = ((1 − t) ◦ IHK) CJ (t ◦ OHK) for K ∈ Kn and 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, where
dim J ∈ {0, . . . , n} and J ⊂ H or J ⊃ H, and again, further examples can be obtained by
concatenating these symmetrizations for diﬀerent t and J.
In the context of Corollary 7.3 and Theorem 7.5 it is natural also to consider deﬁning
♦tK = (1 − t)SHK +p tMH K or ♦tK = (1 − t)IH K +p tOHK, where 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and the Lp
sum is taken with respect to the centroid of SH K or IHK, as appropriate. However, ♦t is not
monotonic when p > 1.

8. Convergence of successive symmetrals

Elsewhere in this paper we always consider a symmetrization ♦ = ♦H : B → BH with
respect to a ﬁxed subspace H. In this section, we ﬁx i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} but regard ♦ as the
entire collection of such maps, for all H ∈ G(n, i), and consider the convergence of successive
applications of ♦ through a sequence of i-dimensional subspaces.
(We do not attempt to
obtain optimal results; the topic will be thoroughly investigated in a future paper.) To keep
the terminology clear, we refer to the collection ♦ of maps ♦H as a symmetrization process. We
shall use and extend ideas of Coupier and Davydov [5], who consider only the case i = n − 1,
and adopt some of their notation in modiﬁed form.
Let i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} and suppose that ♦ is a symmetrization process such that for each
H ∈ G(n, i), ♦H : B → BH is an i-symmetrization. Let (Hm) be a sequence in G(n, i) and for

convenience write ♦m = ♦Hm for m ∈ N. If 1 ≤ j ≤ m, let

♦j,mK = ♦m(♦m−1(· · · (♦jK)· · · ))

Let B = Kn

n. A sequence (Hm) in G(n, i) is called weakly ♦-universal if for all K ∈ Kn

for each K ∈ B, so that ♦j,mK results from m − j + 1 successive ♦-symmetrizations applied
to K with respect to Hj, Hj+1, . . . , Hm.
n and
j ∈ N, there exists r(j, K) > 0 such that ♦j,mK → r(j, K)Bn as m → ∞. Note that this
implies in particular that the successive symmetrals ♦1,mK converge to a ball as m → ∞.
If the constant r(j, K) is independent of j, we say that (Hm) is ♦-universal. Example 8.3
below exhibits a symmetrization ♦ and a sequence (Hm) that is weakly ♦-universal but not
♦-universal.
We shall use the terms (weakly) S-universal or (weakly) M-universal when ♦ is Steiner
or Minkowski symmetrization, respectively, and when i = n − 1, also use the terms for
the sequences (um) of directions in Sn−1 such that Hm = u⊥
In fact, by [5,
Theorem 3.1], a sequence (um) in Sn−1 is S-universal if and only if it is M-universal. Since
Steiner and Minkowski symmetrization preserve volume and mean width, respectively, it is
easy to see that (um) is weakly S-universal (or weakly M-universal) if and only if it is S-
universal (or M-universal, respectively). Much is known about such sequences; in particular,
any sequence (um) that is dense in Sn−1 has each of these four equivalent properties.

m for each m.

The proof of the following result essentially follows that of [5, Theorem 3.1] and we include

it for the convenience of the reader.
Theorem 8.1. Let i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} and let ♦ be a symmetrization process on Kn
that

n. Suppose

IHK ⊂ ♦H K ⊂ MH K

n. If (Hm) is an M-universal sequence in G(n, i), then (Hm)

(28)
for all H ∈ G(n, i) and all K ∈ Kn
is weakly ♦-universal.
Proof. Let (Hm) be M-universal and let K ∈ Kn
n. It is easy to see that any ball with center at
the origin that contains K will also contain all the successive ♦-symmetrals ♦1,mK. If m ∈ N
and L ∈ Kn
n, then by (28), we have ♦mL ⊂ MmL and hence V1(♦mL) ≤ V1(MmL) = V1(L).
Taking L = ♦1,m−1K, we obtain V1(♦1,mK) ≤ V1(♦1,m−1K) for all m = 2, 3, . . . . Therefore
V1(♦1,mK) → a, say, as m → ∞.
n, there is an n-dimensional ball contained in K of radius b > 0. For any
L ∈ Kn
n and m ∈ N, let ImL = IHmL. From the deﬁnition of the inner rotational symmetral,
it is clear that if L contains an n-dimensional ball of radius b, then ImL does as well. Then
(28) implies that ♦1,mK, m ∈ N, also contains an n-dimensional ball of radius b. It follows
that a > 0. By Blaschke’s selection theorem, there is a subsequence (Hmp) of (Hm) such that
♦1,mpK → J ∈ Kn

n as p → ∞, where V1(J) = a > 0.

Since K ∈ Kn

Now if 1 ≤ p ≤ s, then by (28),

(29)

♦1,msK = ♦mp+1,ms(♦1,mpK) ⊂ Mmp+1,ms(♦1,mpK).

26

GABRIELE BIANCHI, RICHARD J. GARDNER, AND PAOLO GRONCHI

As s → ∞, the body on the left converges to J, while because (Hm) is M-universal, the body
on the right converges a ball Bp,K with center at the origin such that V1(Bp,K) = V1(♦1,mpK).
However, the latter equation implies that V1(Bp,K) → a as p → ∞. Since V1 is strictly
monotonic, J ⊂ Bp,K by (29), and V1(J) = a, this forces J to be the ball B1 centered at the
origin with V1(B1) = a. Consequently, any convergent subsequence of (♦1,mK) converges to
B1 and hence ♦1,mK → B1 as m → ∞.
Finally, if j ∈ N, j ≥ 2, we can apply the above argument to the M-universal sequence
(Hm+j−1), m ∈ N, to conclude that ♦j,mK converges to a ball Bj as m → ∞. This proves
that (Hm) is weakly ♦-universal.

(cid:3)

Note that if i = n − 1, then IH = SH , the Steiner symmetral. As noted above, M-universal
and S-universal sequences coincide. By Theorem 6.3, when i = n − 1 the hypotheses of
the following corollary hold if the assumption that ♦ is monotonic and invariant under H-
symmetric sets is replaced by the assumption that ♦ is strictly monotonic, idempotent, and
either invariant on H-symmetric cylinders or projection invariant.
Corollary 8.2. Let i ∈ {1, . . . , n− 1} and let ♦ be a symmetrization process on Kn
n. Suppose
that for each H ∈ G(n, i), ♦ : Kn
nH is monotonic, invariant on H-symmetric sets, and
invariant under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets. If (Hm) is an M-universal
sequence, then (Hm) is weakly ♦-universal.
Proof. By Corollary 7.3 and Theorem 7.5, (28) holds for all H ∈ G(n, i) and all K ∈ Kn
result follows directly from Theorem 8.1.

n → Kn

n. The
(cid:3)

Examples 5.10 and 5.14, both with j = 1 (say) and Bn replaced by an H-symmetric
n-dimensional cube, show that the assumptions of invariance on H-symmetric sets and mono-
tonicity, respectively, cannot be dropped in the previous corollary. We do not have an example
showing that the assumption of invariance under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric
sets is necessary. However, the following example shows that if this assumption is omitted,
the hypotheses of Corollary 8.2 do not allow the stronger conclusion that (Hm) is ♦-universal.
Example 8.3. Let ♦ be the symmetrization process corresponding to the symmetrization
♦H in Example 5.8, with n = 2 and i = 1. Let 0 < θ < π/2 be an irrational multiple of π and
let H1 be the line through the origin in the direction (cos θ, sin θ). For m ∈ N, let H2m+1 = H1
and H2m = e⊥
2 . Then the sequence (Hm) is S-universal; see, for example, [18, Corollary 5.4].
We claim that (Hm) is weakly ♦-universal. (Note that this is not a consequence of Corol-
lary 8.2.) To see this, let K be a planar convex body, let j ∈ N, and let Dj ⊂ ♦jK be a disk
of radius r > 0 whose center xj ∈ Hj is at distance kxjk from the origin and at distance d ≥ 0,
say, from Hj+1. Then the distance from Dj to Hj+1 is no larger than d and the deﬁnition
of ♦ implies that ♦j+1D is an ellipse with center xj+1 = xj|Hj+1 at distance kxjk cos θ from
the origin and area at least e−dπr2. The distance from xj+1 to Hj+2 is d cos θ, so similarly,
♦j,j+2D is an ellipse with center xj+2 = xj+1|Hj+2 at distance kxjk cos2 θ from the origin and
area at least e−d cos θe−dπr2. Arguing inductively, we see that ♦j,mD is an ellipse with center

say, for each m ≥ j. Now ♦j,mD ⊂ Sj,mD, which is a disk of radius r, so the diameter d(♦j,mD)
of ♦j,mD is no larger than 2r. Consequently, by the extended isoperimetric inequality [8,
(B.21), p. 420] with i = 1 and n = 2, we obtain

V1((♦j,mD)|H) = d(♦j,mD) ≥

for each m ≥ j. The distance from the center xj+m of ♦j,mD to the origin is kxjk cosm θ → 0
as m → ∞, so there is an m0 = m0(j) such that o ∈ ♦j,m0D ⊂ ♦j,m0K. Then for m ≥
m0 + 1, we have ♦j,mK = ♦m0+1,m(♦j,m0K) = Sm0+1,m(♦j,m0K). Since (Hm) is S-universal,
♦j,mK → r(j, K)Bn for some r(j, K) > 0, proving the claim.
Now let K = [−a, a] × [1, 1 + b], where a, b > 0 are chosen so that K ∩ H1 6= ∅ and
o ∈ K|H1. Then o ∈ ♦1K = S1K, from which it follows that ♦1,mK = S1,mK and hence that
V2(♦1,mK) = 2ab for m ∈ N. On the other hand, ♦2K = [−a, a] × [−b/(2e), b/(2e)], so o ∈
♦2,mK = S2,m(♦2K) yields V2(♦2,mK) = 2ab/e for m ∈ N. It follows that r(1, K) 6= r(2, K),
proving that (Hm) is not ♦-universal.

9. Characterizations of Minkowski symmetrization

We begin with the following basic characterization.

Theorem 9.1. Let H ∈ G(n, i), i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}. If ♦ : Kn → Kn
H is monotonic, invariant
on H-symmetric sets, and linear (i.e., ♦(K + L) = ♦K + ♦L for all K, L ∈ Kn), then ♦ is
Minkowski symmetrization with respect to H.
Proof. If y ∈ H ⊥, then

♦{y} + ♦{y†} = ♦({y} + {y†}) = ♦{o} = {o},

since {o} is an H-symmetric set. This implies that both ♦{y} and ♦{y†} are singletons.
Moreover, by the monotonicity, both are contained in ♦[y, y†] = [y, y†]. Thus ♦y is an H-
symmetric singleton contained in [y, y†] and it follows that ♦{y} = {o}. If K ∈ Kn, we then
have

♦(K + y) = ♦K + ♦{y} = ♦K,

so ♦ is invariant under translations orthogonal to H. By Corollary 7.3, ♦K ⊂ MH K and
♦K † ⊂ MH(K †). Moreover,
K+K † = ♦(K+K †) = ♦K+♦K † ⊂ MHK+♦K † ⊂ MH K+MHK † = MH (K+K †) = K+K †,
since K + K † is H-symmetric. This implies that ♦K + ♦K † = MHK + ♦K † and by the
cancelation law for Minkowski addition [27, p. 139], we have ♦K = MH K.

n. Suppose that

Proof. Let K ∈ B. For part (i), we can appeal to Theorem 7.4 with F = V1, the ﬁrst intrinsic
volume, to conclude that ♦K ⊂ MH K. Then, since both ♦ and MH preserve mean width,
we obtain

V1(K) = V1(♦K) ≤ V1(MH K) = V1(K).

Hence V1(♦K) = V1(MH K) and with ♦K ⊂ MHK we conclude that ♦K = MHK.
follows as before.

For part (ii), we may appeal to Corollary 7.3 to get ♦K ⊂ MH K and then the conclusion

(cid:3)

Minkowski-Blaschke symmetrization shows that the restriction to i = n − 1 cannot be
dropped in (i). Examples 5.10, 5.11, and 5.12, all with j = 1, show that none of the other
assumptions in (i) can be omitted. (Note that if ♦ is V1-preserving, then ♦K ⊂ MH K implies
that ♦K = MH K.)
Concerning (ii), Example 5.14, ﬁber symmetrization FH, and Minkowski-Blaschke sym-
metrization show that the monotonicity, mean width preserving, and invariance on H-symmetric
sets cannot be omitted. We do not have an example to show that the assumption of invariance
under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets is necessary; see Problem 11.4.

10. Characterizations of Steiner symmetrization

Theorem 10.1. (i) Let i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} and let H ∈ G(n, i). Suppose that ♦ : Cn → Cn
H
is an i-symmetrization that is monotonic, volume preserving, and invariant on H-symmetric
cylinders. Then

Hn−i(cid:0)(♦K) ∩ (H ⊥ + x)(cid:1) = Hn−i(cid:0)K ∩ (H ⊥ + x)(cid:1)

(30)
for all K ∈ Cn and Hi-almost all x ∈ H.
(ii) Suppose that i = n− 1 and that in addition to the assumptions in (i), (♦K)∩ (H ⊥ + x)
is a line segment for Hn−1-almost all x ∈ H. Then ♦ is essentially Steiner symmetrization
on Cn, in the sense that for all K ∈ Cn, (♦K) ∩ G = (SH K) ∩ G for Hn−1-almost all lines G
orthogonal to H.
Proof. (i) Fix K ∈ Cn. For r > 0, let Dr(x) denote the i-dimensional ball in H with center x
and radius r. Choose s > 0 so that K|H ⊥ ⊂ s(Bn ∩ H ⊥). Let Cr(x) = Dr(x) + s(Bn ∩ H ⊥)
and for all L ∈ Cn and x ∈ H, deﬁne

mr,L(x) = Hn(L ∩ Cr(x))

SYMMETRIZATION IN GEOMETRY

29

and

(31)

We ﬁrst claim that

mL(x) = Hn−i(L ∩ (H ⊥ + x)).

mr,♦K ≥ mr,K.

(32)
To see this, let r > 0 and x ∈ H. By the invariance on H-symmetric cylinders, ♦Cr(x) =
Cr(x). Since ♦ is monotonic,
♦(cid:0)K ∩ Cr(x)(cid:1) ⊂ (♦K) ∩ Cr(x).
(33)
Therefore, using the fact that ♦ is volume preserving, we obtain

mr,♦K(x) = Hn((♦K) ∩ Cr(x)) ≥ Hn(♦(K ∩ Cr(x))) = Hn(K ∩ Cr(x)) = mr,K(x).

This proves (32). Next, it follows immediately from Lebesgue’s diﬀerentiation theorem (see
e.g. [26, Theorem 8.8]) that

(34)

lim
r→0

= mK(x)

and

lim
r→0

= m♦K(x)

mr,K(x)
Hi(Dr(x))

mr,♦K(x)
Hi(Dr(x))

for Hi-almost all x ∈ H. From (31) and the volume-preserving property of ♦, we obtain

ZH

(m♦K(x) − mK(x)) dx = Hn(♦K) − Hn(K) = 0.

By (32) and (34), the previous integrand is nonnegative for Hi-almost all x ∈ H and therefore
vanishes Hi-almost everywhere in H, yielding (30).

(ii) This follows directly from (30) and the deﬁnition of SHK.

(cid:3)

We remark that the assumptions in part (i) of the previous theorem can be weakened, since
the result remains true if the monotonicity and invariance on H-symmetric cylinders only
hold modulo sets of zero Hn-measure. In this case the conclusion in part (ii) is also slightly
weaker, namely that for all K ∈ Cn, Hn((♦K)△SHK) = 0. The extra assumption made in
part (ii) is very strong, but the following example indicates that it may be diﬃcult to weaken
it signiﬁcantly.

Example 10.2. Let H = e⊥

n . For each K ∈ Cn, let ♦1K = SH(K ∩ (Rn−1 × [−1, 1])), let

♦2K = SH (K ∩ (Rn−1 × ((−∞,−1) ∪ (1,∞)))),

and let ♦K = (♦1K)∪ (((♦2K)∩ (Rn−1 × [0,∞))) + en)∪ (((♦2K)∩ (Rn−1 × (−∞, 0]))− en).
Since both ♦1 and ♦2 are monotonic and preserve the volume of the subset of K on which
they act, it follows easily that ♦ : Cn → Cn
It is
straightforward to check that ♦ is also invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, but it is essentially
diﬀerent from Steiner symmetrization with respect to H. Note that while the assumption in
Theorem 10.1(ii) is false, (♦K) ∩ (H + x) is the union of at most three line segments for all
x ∈ H.

H is monotonic and volume preserving.

(cid:3)

(♦(K ∩ Cr(x)))|H = (K ∩ Cr(x))|H ⊂ Dr(x) = Cr(x)|H

and hence, since (♦K)|H ⊥ ⊂ Cr(x)|H ⊥, we have
(36)

♦(K ∩ Cr(x)) ⊂ (♦K) ∩ Cr(x).

In the following, we write Kn

nH instead of (Kn

n)H for the class of convex bodies in Rn that

are H-symmetric.
Theorem 10.3. Let i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}, let H ∈ G(n, i), and let ♦ : Kn
nH be an i-
symmetrization. Suppose that ♦ is monotonic, volume preserving, and projection invariant.

K ∩ Cr(x) ⊂ K, the monotonicity of ♦ gives ♦(K ∩ Cr(x)) ⊂ ♦K. The projection invariance
of ♦ implies that

n. If ♦ is assumed to be projection invariant, then by Theorem 10.3 with

With (36) in hand, the proof of Theorem 10.1(i) may be followed from (33) onwards to conclude
that (35) holds for Hi-almost all x ∈ relint (K|H). By the projection invariance of ♦ and
continuity, this is enough to yield (35) for all x ∈ H.
Corollary 10.4. Let H ∈ G(n, n − 1) and let ♦ : Kn
nH be an (n − 1)-symmetrization.
If ♦ is monotonic, volume preserving, and either invariant on H-symmetric cylinders or
projection invariant, then ♦ is Steiner symmetrization with respect to H.
Proof. Let K ∈ Kn
i = n − 1, we have
(37)
for all lines G orthogonal to H. Since ♦K is H-symmetric, this yields ♦K = SHK. If ♦
is assumed to be invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, we can apply Theorem 10.1(i) with
i = n − 1 to obtain (37) for Hn−1-almost all lines G orthogonal to H. Since ♦K and SHK
are convex bodies, (37) holds for all lines G orthogonal to H by continuity and the conclusion
follows as before.
(cid:3)
For maps ♦ : Kn
If in Corollary 10.4, it is only assumed that ♦ does not decrease volume, i.e., Vn(♦K) ≥
Vn(K) for all K ∈ Kn
n, instead of the condition that ♦ is volume preserving, then the proofs
of Theorem 10.1(i) and Theorem 10.3 show that SHK ⊂ ♦K for all K ∈ Kn
n. However,
Example 5.11(ii) shows that this is not enough to conclude that ♦ is Steiner symmetrization.
Similarly, Example 5.11(i) shows that it is not enough to assume that ♦ does not increase
volume instead of preserving volume.

nH, Examples 5.10 with j = n, 5.11, and 5.12 with j = n show that

none of the assumptions can be omitted.

SYMMETRIZATION IN GEOMETRY

For j ∈ {1, . . . , n− 1}, the jth intrinsic volume does not increase under Steiner symmetriza-
tion; see [27, p. 587]. But again, Example 5.11(ii) shows that in Corollary 10.4, the volume-
preserving property of ♦ cannot be replaced by the assumption that ♦ does not increase the
jth intrinsic volume for j ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}.
Corollary 10.5. Let H ∈ G(n, n−1) and let ♦ : Kn → Kn
H be an (n−1)-symmetrization. If ♦
is monotonic, volume preserving, and either invariant on H-symmetric cylinders or projection
invariant, then ♦K = SHK for each K ∈ Kn not contained in a hyperplane orthogonal to H.
Proof. Since ♦ is volume preserving, we have ♦ : Kn
nH and hence by Corollary 10.4, the
result holds when K is a convex body. Suppose that dim K < n. For each ε > 0, K + εBn
is a convex body, so ♦(K + εBn) = SH(K + εBn). Therefore, if K is not contained in a
hyperplane orthogonal to H, the monotonicity of ♦ yields

n → Kn

♦K ⊂ ♦(K + εBn) = SH(K + εBn) → K|H = SHK

in the Hausdorﬀ metric as ε → 0+.
If ♦ is projection invariant, we obtain ♦K = SHK
immediately. Otherwise, we know only that ♦K ⊂ K|H = SHK. Suppose that (K|H)\♦K 6=
∅. Choose L ∈ Kn with L ⊂ K and L|H ⊂ (K|H) \ ♦K. Since the previous argument shows
that ♦L ⊂ L|H, we obtain ♦L 6⊂ ♦K, contradicting the monotonicity of ♦. Therefore
♦K = K|H = SH K as before.
Example 10.6. Let H ∈ G(n, n − 1) and for all K ∈ Kn, let ♦K = SHK if K is not
contained in a hyperplane orthogonal to H and ♦K = K|H otherwise. Then ♦ : Kn →
Kn
H is monotonic, volume preserving, idempotent, invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, and
projection invariant. However, ♦ is not invariant on H-symmetric sets and is therefore not
Steiner symmetrization; indeed, if u ∈ Sn−1 is orthogonal to H and K = [−au, au] for a > 0,
then SHK = [−au, au] 6= {o} = K|H = ♦K.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

Returning to Theorem 10.3, we note that the hypotheses stated there are not enough to
conclude that ♦ is Schwarz symmetrization. This is shown by Example 5.13 with j = n − i
and L 6= Bn ∩ H ⊥, as well as by the following diﬀerent example, which together suggest that
it may be diﬃcult to ﬁnd a nontrivial characterization of Schwarz symmetrization.
Example 10.7. Let i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 2} and let H ∈ G(n, i). Choose mutually orthogonal
subspaces Hj ∈ G(n, n − 1), j = 1, . . . , n − i, such that H = ∩n−i
n, deﬁne
♦K = (SH1 ◦ SH2 ◦ · · · ◦ SHn−i)K. Since ♦K is Hj-symmetric, j = 1, . . . , n − i, it is also
H-symmetric and hence ♦ : Kn
nH is an i-symmetrization. Moreover, ♦ is strictly mono-
tonic, volume preserving, invariant on H-symmetric sets, and projection invariant. However,
♦ is not Schwarz symmetrization.

Problem 11.1. Let i = n−1 and let j ∈ {2, . . . , n−1}. Is there a symmetrization ♦ : B → BH
that is monotonic, Vj-preserving, and either invariant on H-symmetric cylinders or projection
invariant?

In particular, taking j = n − 1 in Problem 11.1, is there a symmetrization on compact
convex sets that behaves like Minkowski or Steiner symmetrization but which preserves surface
area instead of mean width or volume? Variants of Problem 11.1 may be posed, for example
insisting that ♦ be invariant on H-symmetric sets or extending the question to i ∈ {1, . . . , n−
1}.
Is there a symmetrization ♦ : B → BH that is
Problem 11.2. Let i ∈ {2, . . . , n − 2}.
strictly monotonic, idempotent, and invariant on H-symmetric cylinders, but not projection
invariant?

We remark that if such a ♦ exists, it cannot be invariant under translations orthogonal
Indeed, suppose it is and let K ∈ B. Then by Theorem 7.5,
to H of H-symmetric sets.
♦K ⊂ OHK, and since OH is projection invariant, we obtain (♦K)|H ⊂ (OHK)|H = K|H.
The second paragraph of the proof of Theorem 6.1 shows, assuming only monotonicity and
invariance on H-symmetric cylinders, that the reverse inclusion K|H ⊂ (♦K)|H holds, so ♦
is projection invariant.
Problem 11.3. Let i ∈ {2, . . . , n − 2}. Is there a strictly increasing set function F : B →
[0,∞) and a symmetrization ♦ : B → BH that is monotonic, F -preserving, and invariant on
H-symmetric cylinders, but not projection invariant?
Is there a symmetrization ♦ : B → BH that is
Problem 11.4. Let i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 2}.
monotonic, mean width preserving, and invariant on H-symmetric sets, but not invariant
under translations orthogonal to H of H-symmetric sets?
