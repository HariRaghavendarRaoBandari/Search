Background: The electromagnetic form factors of the proton measured by unpolarized and polarized electron
scattering experiments show a signiﬁcant disagreement that grows with the squared four momentum transfer (Q2).
Calculations have shown that the two measurements can be largely reconciled by accounting for the contributions
of two-photon exchange (TPE). TPE eﬀects are not typically included in the standard set of radiative corrections
since theoretical calculations of the TPE eﬀects are highly model dependent, and, until recently, no direct evidence
of signiﬁcant TPE eﬀects has been observed.

Purpose: We measured the ratio of positron-proton to electron-proton elastic-scattering cross sections in order
to determine the TPE contribution to elastic electron-proton scattering and thereby resolve the proton electric
form factor discrepancy.

Methods: We produced a mixed simultaneous electron-positron beam in Jeﬀerson Lab’s Hall B by passing the 5.6
GeV primary electron beam through a radiator to produce a bremsstrahlung photon beam and then passing the
photon beam through a convertor to produce electron/positron pairs. The mixed electron-positron (lepton) beam
with useful energies from approximately 0.85 to 3.5 GeV then struck a 30-cm long liquid hydrogen (LH2) target
located within the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). By detecting both the scattered leptons and
the recoiling protons we identiﬁed and reconstructed elastic scattering events and determined the incident lepton
energy. A detailed description of the experiment is presented.

Results: We present previously unpublished results for the quantity R2γ, the TPE correction to the elastic-
scattering cross section, at Q2 ≈ 0.85 and 1.45 GeV2 over a large range of virtual photon polarization ε.
Conclusions: Our results, along with recently published results from VEPP-3, demonstrate a non-zero contri-
bution from TPE eﬀects and are in excellent agreement with the calculations that include TPE eﬀects and largely
reconcile the form-factor discrepancy up to Q2 ≈ 2 GeV2. The combined world data are consistent with an
increase in R2γ with decreasing ε at Q2 ≈ 0.85 and 1.45 GeV2. There are indications of a slight increase in R2γ
with Q2.

INTRODUCTION

The electromagnetic form factors are the fundamental
observables that contain information about the spatial
distribution of the charge and magnetization inside the
proton. The electric (GE(Q2)) and magnetic (GM (Q2))
form factors have been extracted by analyzing data from
both unpolarized and polarized electron scattering exper-
iments assuming an exchange of a virtual photon between
the electron and the proton.
The unpolarized electron scattering experiments use
the Rosenbluth separation method [1–6], where the e−p
elastic cross section is measured at ﬁxed four-momentum
transfer, Q2 (Q2 = −q2 = 4EE(cid:48) sin2(θ/2), where E is the

ence between the lepton and proton bremsstrahlung ra-
diation terms, which is of comparable size to the TPE
eﬀect.

where δeven is the total charge-even radiative correction
factor and δ2γ and δe.p.brem are the TPE and lepton–
proton bremsstrahlung interference contributions. See
Ref. [34] for more details. The signs of δ2γ and δe.p.brem
are chosen by convention such that they appear as addi-
tive corrections for electron scattering. Typically, the ex-
perimental ratio R is corrected for the calculated δe.p.brem
and δeven to isolate the TPE contribution:

R2γ ≈ 1 − 2δ2γ.

The measured TPE correction (δ2γ) can be directly used
to correct the measured reduced unpolarized elastic scat-
tering cross section, σR (Eq. 1), as

magnetic moment, extracted from polarized and unpolar-
ized electron scattering shows a signiﬁcant discrepancy
that grows with Q2, as seen in Fig. 1.

A popular explanation is that the observed discrep-
ancy results from neglecting hard two-photon exchange
(TPE) corrections [14–17], a higher-order contribution to
the radiative corrections [18–20]. In TPE, the ﬁrst ex-
changed virtual photon can excite the proton to a higher
state and the second virtual photon de-excites the pro-
ton back to its ground state. TPE will aﬀect the cross
section through its interference with the single photon
exchange (First Born Approximation) amplitude. This
should be smaller than the Born cross section by a factor
of α ≈ 1/137. However, the size of the TPE contribu-
tion to the cross section is expected to have a signiﬁcant
ε dependence [21, 22] that grows with Q2, while the ε-
dependent part of the unpolarized cross section in the
Born Approximation becomes very small at large Q2.

Calculations of the box and crossed TPE diagrams
(Figs. 2(f) and 2(e)) in elastic e−p scattering are compli-
cated since such calculations require complete knowledge
of intermediate hadronic states [21, 23–31]. As a result,
these calculations have signiﬁcant model dependence.

A model-independent way of measuring the size of the
TPE eﬀect is by comparing e−p and e+p elastic scatter-
ing cross sections [32, 33]. The interference between one-
and two-photon exchange diagrams has the opposite sign
for electrons and positrons while most of the other radia-
tive corrections are identical for electrons and positrons
and cancel in the ratio. Apart from TPE, the only other

and then used to extract the TPE-corrected GE and GM .
An analysis of Rosenbluth separation data [35] found
no non-linear eﬀects in the relationship between σR and
ε in elastic [6], inelastic or deep inelastic scattering. As-
suming a TPE contribution linearly dependent on ε, the
polarization-Rosenbluth discrepancy can be used to esti-
mate the size of the TPE contributions needed to recon-
cile them. For Q2 above 3-4 GeV2, an ε-dependent cor-
rection of approximately 5% could explain the observed
discrepancy [13, 14, 17, 36]. At Q2 < 2 GeV2 the discrep-
ancy is smaller and provides a less sensitive constraint on
TPE contributions [37], though is consistent with a few
per cent correction.

In the 1960s and 1970s there were several attempts to
determine the TPE corrections to electron-proton elas-
tic scattering. Early measurements comparing electron
and positron elastic-scattering cross sections [38–46] were
largely limited to low Q2 and/or high ε, where calcula-
tions [47–49] suggest that TPE contributions are small.
Given the limited experimental sensitivity of these early
measurements, none of the experiments observed a sig-
niﬁcant deviation from R2γ = 1. A global analysis [32]
of these measurements showed only limited evidence for
non-zero TPE contributions. Improved measurements of
these contributions, in particular for large Q2 and small ε
values, are required to reconcile the form factor discrep-
ancy.
There have been several recent attempts to make im-
proved TPE measurements by comparing e±p scattering.
The VEPP-3 [50, 51] and OLYMPUS [52, 53] experi-
ments used alternating electron and positron beams in
storage rings incident on internal gas targets. In these
experiments, data for e±p scattering are taken at a ﬁxed
beam energy leading to known event kinematics. These
experiments measure R2γ as a function of lepton scatter-
ing angle, which varies both Q2 and ε simultaneously, and
do not measure the ε dependence at ﬁxed Q2. Because
the target thickness and hence the luminosity was not
well known, both experiments normalized their data to
R2γ = 1 at low Q2 and high ε. The VEPP-3 experiment
utilizes a non-magnetic spectrometer while the OLYM-
PUS experiment utilizes the upgraded BLAST detector
that was previously located at MIT-BATES.
The MUSE Collaboration [54] will compare e±p and
µ±p scattering at very low Q2. This is motivated by
the “proton radius puzzle”, the diﬀerence between pro-
ton radius extractions involving muonic hydrogen [55, 56]
and those involving electron-proton interactions [10, 57,
58]. The MUSE experiment will compare electron and
muon scattering to look for indications of lepton non-
universality, but will also examine TPE corrections,
which are important in the radius extraction from elec-
tron scattering data [21, 59–65].
We applied a very diﬀerent approach to compare e+p
and e−p scattering. Rather than alternating between
mono-energetic e+ and e− beams, we generated a mixed
beam of positrons and electrons covering a wide range of
energies and used the large-acceptance CLAS spectrom-

4

eter in experimental Hall B at Jeﬀerson Lab to detect
both the scattered lepton and the struck proton. The
over-constrained elastic-scattering kinematics allowed us
to reject inelastic events and to determine the energy of
the incident lepton in each event. This allows a simulta-
neous measurement of electron and positron scattering,
while also covering a wide range in ε and Q2. This pa-
per is a follow up to our previously published results [66]
and includes corrections for δeven along with previously
unpublished results.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

This experiment was conducted at the Thomas Jef-
ferson National Accelerator Facility (Jeﬀerson Lab). A
simultaneous mixed beam of electrons and positrons was
produced using the 5.6 GeV primary electron beam from
the accelerator (see Fig. 3). Bremsstrahlung photons
were produced by bombarding a 9×10−3 radiation length
(RL) gold radiator with a 110-140-nA electron beam.
The resulting photon beam traversed a 12.7-mm inner-
diameter nickel collimator, while the electrons were di-
verted into the tagger beam dump by the Hall B tagger
magnet [67]. The photon beam then struck a 0.09 RL
gold converter to produce electron-positron pairs. The
mixed lepton-photon beam then passed through a three-
dipole magnet chicane. The chicane bent electrons and
positrons in the opposite directions, spatially separating
them in the horizontal plane (shown as a vertical sepa-
ration in Fig. 3). The photon beam was stopped by a
4-cm-wide and 35-cm-long tungsten block placed at the
upstream face of the second dipole. The electron and
positron beams were then recombined into a single beam
by the third dipole. The mixed lepton beam then passed
through a pair of collimators en route to a 6 cm-diameter,
30-cm long liquid hydrogen (LH2) target. The scattered
leptons and the protons were detected in the CEBAF
Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) [68].
The ﬁrst and third dipoles of the TPE chicane were
operated with a magnetic ﬁeld of B ≈ ±0.4 T and were
about 0.5 m long. They were powered in series by a single
power supply. The second dipole had a ﬁeld of B ≈ ∓0.38
T and was about 1 m long. The momentum acceptance
of the chicane is ﬁxed by the width of the photon blocker
and the apertures of the second dipole. The width of
the photon blocker (±2 cm) ﬁxed the maximum lepton
momentum and the aperture of approximately ±20 cm
ﬁxed the minimum lepton momentum. In the ideal case
the three dipoles are left-right symmetric and the two
lepton beams should be identical. The ﬁnal useful lepton
beam energy ranged from approximately 0.5 to 3.5 GeV.
This experiment ran with a much higher primary elec-
tron beam current and much thicker radiator than is nor-
mally used in CLAS photoproduction experiments and
the process of producing a tertiary mixed beam pro-
duced a large rate of background radiation in the hall.
To protect CLAS from this radiation a number of shield-

a systematic charge bias in lepton detection. Data from
the EC was not necessary for particle identiﬁcation and
due to limited angular coverage and the possibility that
it would bias the electron-positron comparison, the EC
was not used in the analysis. A compact mini-torus mag-
net (not shown) was placed close to the target to shield
the drift chambers from Møller electrons.

A sparse ﬁber beam monitor (labeled as Beam Mon-
itor in Fig. 3) was installed just upstream of CLAS to
measure the position and spatial distribution of the two

ing structures (not shown in Fig. 3) were installed in the
hall. Two large shielding structures were constructed be-
tween the ﬁrst and second dipoles of the chicane and
between the second and third dipoles of the chicane. A
1-m by 1-m by 0.1-m thick lead wall was placed imme-
diately downstream of the chicane. The lepton beams
passed through a 1.75-cm diameter tungsten collimator
in this wall. Further downstream just before CLAS was
a 4-m by 4-m by 2.5-cm thick steel wall. A second lepton
beam collimator made of lead with a 4-cm diameter aper-
ture was located at the entrance to CLAS. The shielding
around the CLAS tagger beam dump was increased dur-
ing a 2004 test run [34] and remained in place for this
experiment. This shielding was designed to remove back-
grounds from the beamline and beam dump that would
otherwise overwhelm the CLAS detector systems.

CLAS (see Fig. 4) is a nearly 4π acceptance detec-
tor divided into six segments known as sectors. Six
superconducting coils produce a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld
in the azimuthal direction. The magnetic ﬁeld bends
the charged particles towards (in-benders) or away (out-
benders) from the beamline. Each CLAS sector con-
tains three regions (R1, R2, and R3) of drift cham-
bers to determine charged particle trajectories [69], a
Cherenkov counter (CC) for electron identiﬁcation [70],
time-of-ﬂight (TOF) scintillator counters for timing mea-
surements [71], and an electromagnetic calorimeter (EC)
for energy measurements of charged and neutral parti-
cles [72]. The CC and EC cover only the forward region
of CLAS (8◦ < θ < 45◦). The CLAS event trigger re-
quired at least some minimum ionizing energy deposited
in the EC in any sector and a hit in the opposite sec-
tor TOF. The CC was not used because it is optimized

measuring the energy distributions of the electron and
positron beams with the “TPE calorimeter” installed
downstream of CLAS. To measure the energy distribu-
tion of one lepton beam, we inserted the calorimeter into
the beamline, emptied the target, blocked the other beam
and reduced the beam intensity by a factor of about 10−4
by reducing the primary beam current to 1 nA and re-
ducing the radiator thickness to 10−4 RL.

The TPE Calorimeter consisted of 30 shashlik modules
[73] arranged in ﬁve rows of six modules each. The indi-
vidual shashlik modules (Fig. 7) are 3.82× 3.82× 45 cm3
and consist of alternating 3.82× 3.82 cm2 layers of 1-mm
thick lead and 2-mm thick plastic scintillator. Each mod-
ule has 16 wavelength shifting light-guide ﬁbers, each 1.5
mm in diameter and spaced 7.7 mm apart. The wave-
length shifting ﬁbers transmit the light from the individ-
ual scintillator layers to photomultiplier tubes. In front
of the shashlik modules was a dense ﬁber monitor (DFM)
consisting of a closely-packed array of 1×1 cm2 scintillat-
ing ﬁbers arranged both horizontally and vertically, with
an area that covered the face of the calorimeter. We used

lepton beams and to monitor their stability during the
experiment. The sparse ﬁber beam monitor contains two
sets of 16, 1 × 1 mm2 scintillating ﬁbers forming verti-
cal and horizontal grids with a ﬁber separation of 5 mm.
During commissioning and following each chicane mag-
netic ﬁeld reversal, we blocked one of the lepton beams
by inserting a remotely-controlled lead block at the en-
trance of the second chicane dipole. By alternately block-
ing each one of the two lepton beams, we measured the
centroid and shape of the other beam in two dimensions
as shown in Fig. 5. In order to center both lepton beams
at the same position, we determined the position of each
individual beam as a function of the current in the ﬁrst
and third chicane dipoles. Figure 6 shows the location
of the positron and electron beams as a function of the
dipole current. We set the ﬁnal current at the crossing of
the ﬁts to the individual beam positions for both chicane
polarities.

We periodically reversed the polarity of the CLAS
torus magnets and the beamline chicane magnets to con-
trol systematic uncertainties. Periodic torus ﬁeld reversal
provides control on the systematics due to potential de-
tector acceptance related bias for the oppositely charged
leptons. Similarly, reversing the chicane current swaps
spatial positions of the oppositely charged lepton beams.
Data from three such complete polarity cycles and one
partial cycle were used in the ﬁnal analysis. This is dis-
cussed in more detail in Sec. III D.

We determined the energy-dependent lepton ﬂuxes by

the DFM to make sure that both lepton beams had the
same centroid at the upstream Beam Monitor and at the
DFM and were therefore parallel.

We measured the beam-energy distribution for each
lepton beam before and after each chicane magnet polar-
ity reversal (see Fig. 8). The energy distributions for elec-
trons and positrons passing through the left side of the
chicane are very similar to each other as are the distribu-
tions for when the electrons and positrons pass through
the right side of the chicane. However, the distributions
for leptons passing through the left side of the chicane
diﬀer from the distributions of leptons passing through
the right side of the chicane, indicating that the chicane
was not perfectly left/right symmetric.

FIG. 8. (Color online) The beam energy distribution for elec-
trons and positrons as they pass on the left or the right side
of the chicane as indicated by the key. The horizontal axis
is in ADC channel number, where channel 1000 corresponds
approximately to 370 MeV. The distributions are normal-
ized to unity. Note the energy distributions for electrons and
positrons passing on one side of the chicane are very similar
to each other but the energy distributions for the two sides of
the chicane diﬀer from each other, indicating that the chicane
was not symmetric.

In order to know our relative electron and positron

luminosities, we rely on several pieces of information:

• Electron-positron pair production is

charge-

symmetric.

• At energies over 100 MeV, electron and positron
interactions with matter are identical (i.e., the an-
nihilation cross section is negligible and the diﬀer-
ence between Møller and Bhabha cross sections is
negligible).

• The magnet settings of the beamline chicane were

absolutely reproducible for each magnet cycle.

• The ratios of the positron to electron energy dis-
tributions for particles passing on one side of the
chicane (either left or right) as measured by the

ergy distribution to the incident electron energy distribution
versus incident energy (measured in channels where channel
1000 corresponds approximately to 370 MeV) for leptons pass-
ing on the right side of the chicane (top panel) and for lep-
tons passing on the left side of the chicane (middle panel),
and the square root of the product of the two ratios (bottom
panel). The distributions are normalized to unity. The statis-
tics boxes show the results of one-parameter (constant) ﬁts to
the ratios.

TPE Calorimeter are energy independent. This is
shown in Fig. 9 where we have plotted the ratio
of the incident positron energy distribution to that
of the incident electron versus energy for beams
through the left (top) and right (middle) sides of
the chicane. Monte Carlo simulations of the beam-
line reproduce this behavior.

• The product of the ratios of the positron to electron
energy distributions for positive and negative chi-
cane settings as measured by the TPE Calorimeter
is also energy independent as seen in the bottom
panel of Fig. 9.

Since we measured the electron-proton and positron-

cane, any asymmetries in the chicane cancel (see Eq. 14
in Sect. III D) and the resulting lepton luminosities are
equal. Note that the distributions in Fig. 9 are normal-
ized to unity because the separate measurements of e+
and e− distributions making up the ratios could not be
absolutely normalized since we did not have a measure-
ment of the incident primary electron beam charge pre-
cise to 1% at the low primary beam currents used to
measure the energy distributions.

III. DATA ANALYSIS

The identiﬁcation of elastic e±p events with no charge
bias required us to make a series of cuts and corrections
and to test the charge independence of our analysis pro-
cedures. This section will discuss the steps taken in the
analysis process. These include applying momentum and
energy loss corrections, applying data selection cuts, de-
termining dead detector corrections, subtracting back-
grounds, and applying radiative corrections.

A. Energy loss and momentum corrections

As a charged particle traverses CLAS, it loses energy
through interactions with the target and detector ma-
terials. The CLAS reconstruction software returns an
eﬀective momentum without accounting for this energy
loss. For the low momentum protons, this loss could have
a signiﬁcant impact on event reconstruction kinematics.
The standard CLAS ELOSS package corrects for this lost
energy using the Bethe-Bloch equation to relate the ma-
terial characteristics and path length to the energy loss.
Energy-loss corrections ranged from ≈ 4−5 MeV for pro-
tons with momenta above 0.5 GeV up to ≈ 25 MeV for
momenta down to 0.2 GeV.

Because of incomplete knowledge of the magnetic ﬁeld
and drift chamber positions in CLAS, the reconstructed
momenta show some systematic deviations. To deter-
mine the momentum corrections, a set of runs was taken
with a 2.258-GeV primary electron beam incident di-
rectly on the CLAS target. Data were taken with both
torus polarities. We then used exclusive events where all
the ﬁnal-state particles were detected and employed four-
momentum conservation to determine the correct scatter-
ing angles and magnitudes of the momenta. The events
used were p(e, e(cid:48)p) and p(e, e(cid:48)pπ+π−) events. This com-
bination of particles provided the same scattering-angle
and momenta ranges as seen in the ﬁnal data as well as
providing events with both positive and negative charge.
The eﬀect of the momentum corrections lead to an invari-
ant mass distribution for electron-proton elastic scatter-
ing that is consistent with the proton mass to within less
than 1 MeV.

8

B. Data selection cuts

We applied a series of cuts to the data to select elastic
e±p events. In addition to the kinematic cuts described
below, a 28-cm target vertex cut was applied to both
lepton and proton candidates to remove events from the
target walls. A set of momentum-dependent ﬁducial cuts
on the angles (both θ and φ) were applied to select the
region of CLAS with uniform acceptance. The ﬁducial
cuts were selected such that the angular acceptance of
both positrons and electrons were identical for both torus
polarities.

This analysis did not use the usual EC- and CC-based
CLAS lepton identiﬁcation scheme. These detector com-
ponents cover only a limited range of scattering angles.
We instead employed elastic scattering kinematics, which
are over-constrained by the simultaneous detection of
both the lepton and the proton.

The elastic event identiﬁcation algorithm is shown in
Fig. 10 and started with the selection of the events with
at least two good tracks in opposite sectors of CLAS.
Ideally, events with only two tracks would be selected.
However, events triggered by accidental hits in conjunc-
tion with a valid elastic event could have more than two
tracks. In that case, pairs of viable tracks were formed
by looping over all possible good track pairs in the event
that had either a negative/positive or positive/positive
charge combination. For a pair with a negative/positive
charge combination: the negative track was considered
as a e− candidate and the positive track as a p candi-
date.
If the pair passed all elastic kinematic cuts dis-
cussed in the next section, the pair was identiﬁed as the
elastic e−p pair. If not, the next track pair of the event
was considered. For positive/positive pairs, we ﬁrst con-
sidered one of the tracks to be the e+ candidate and
the other to be p candidate. We then checked to see
whether the pair passed elastic kinematic cuts as e+p or
as pe+.
If the pair passed kinematic cuts both as e+p
and as pe+, an additional minimum-timing cross check
was done. This cross check used the diﬀerence between
the TOF of the particle pairs (∆tmeas = proton TOF −
lepton TOF) and compared it to TOF diﬀerence (∆tcalc)
calculated assuming the pair was e+p (pair 1) or pe+ (pair
2). Whichever pair assumption that led to the small-
est diﬀerence ∆tn = ∆tmeas − ∆tcalc (n = 1 or 2) was
assigned to the event. Overall, a negligible fraction of
events (10−5) had more than one pair passing all cuts.
We note that no TOF cuts were applied and that all cuts
for e−p and e+p events were identical in order to avoid
introduction of a charge bias.

1. Elastic Kinematic Cuts

Because elastic scattering kinematics are overdeter-
mined by measuring momenta and angles for both lep-
tons and protons, we can identify elastic events and de-
termine the incident lepton energy by a series of four

ton and proton emerge back to back in the az-
imuthal direction. As a result, the azimuthal an-
gle diﬀerence between the lepton and the proton
(∆φ = φl−φp) was sharply peaked at 180◦ (Fig. 11,
upper left).

2. Lepton Energy Cuts: The unknown energy of the

tering angles of the lepton (θl) and the proton (θp)

Fig. 13 shows that ∆El and ∆E(cid:48) are linearly cor-
related. Rather than applying cuts to these vari-

sums (∆E+ = ∆El + ∆E(cid:48)) and their diﬀerences
(∆E− = ∆El − ∆E(cid:48)). Distributions for ∆E+ and
∆E− are shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 11.

In each case, the widths of the distributions vary with
Q2 and ε. Based on the means and widths of Gaus-
sian ﬁts to the peaks of the distributions, Q2- and ε-
dependent, parameterized cuts were set to ±3σ. Fig. 11
shows distributions of the four cut variables before and
after applying cuts on other three variables. The eﬀect
of the other three cuts on any one variable leads to dis-
tributions that are remarkably free of background for all
but kinematic regions corresponding to large electron an-
gles (see Sec. III E). The non-Gaussian shape of the E−
distribution in Fig 11 is due to summing over the entire

distributions of all elastic scattering events using scattering
angles. The positron (red) and electron (blue) distributions
have been scaled by the total number of counts in the distribu-

diﬀers from Fig. 8 in that it shows the incident energy dis-
tribution for elastic scattering events rather than the overall
beam energy distribution.

butions are changing. For each kinematic bin (see, e.g.,
Fig. 17) the signal peak is Gaussian, but the background
is not.

C. Kinematic coverage and binning

Figure 14 shows the Q2 and ε distribution of e+p elas-
tic scattering events for positive torus polarity. The wide
coverage of Q2 and ε is apparent. There is a hole in the
distribution at ε ≈ 0.7 and lower values of Q2. This hole
is due to the trigger used in the experiment, which re-
quired one particle track hitting the forward TOF and
the EC. Events where neither particle had a lab-frame
scattering angle of less than about 45◦ did not trigger
the CLAS readout. The trigger hole is largest for e+p,
positive torus events, which ultimately limits our kine-
matic coverage.

The data bins (Fig. 14) were selected to measure the
Q2 dependence of R2γ at two values of ε and the ε de-
pendence of R2γ at two values of Q2 with roughly equal
statistical uncertainties in each range. We avoided the
edges of the distributions, where the acceptance for in-
bending and out-bending particles vary rapidly. The bin-
ning choice leads to some overlap in the data bins. The
average values, (cid:104)Q2(cid:105) and (cid:104)ε(cid:105), are given in Tables II and
III.

D. Dead detector removal and acceptance

matching

In addition to the ﬁducial cuts mentioned above, we
also removed dead, broken, and/or ineﬃcient detec-
tor elements of CLAS as these components could lead
to charge-dependent biases in the lepton detection ef-
ﬁciency. Events that hit ineﬃcient TOF paddles were
removed. The forward region of one of the six sectors
of CLAS (sector 3) had a large number of holes due to
dead drift chamber and EC channels. All data with ei-
ther particle entering this region of sector 3 were removed
from the analysis as such events would have insuﬃcient
information for event reconstruction.

As mentioned above, the polarities of the CLAS torus
magnets and the beamline chicane magnets were periodi-
cally reversed during the course of the experiment. For a
given torus polarity, t = ±, and chicane polarity, c = ±,
we measured the ratio of detected elastically-scattered

By taking data with both chicane polarities, any ﬂux-
dependent diﬀerences between the two lepton beams is
eliminated within the uncertainty. Each complete cycle
of chicane and torus polarity reversal contained all four
conﬁgurations (tc = ++, +−, −+, −−).
This experiment relies on the fact that the electron and
positron acceptance factors (f±
± ) cancel out in Eq. 13.
However, ineﬃcient detectors can bias the lepton detec-
tion eﬃciencies. This eﬀect was taken into account by im-
plementing a “swimming” algorithm to ensure the same
detection eﬃciencies in each TOF paddle. For each event,
this algorithm traced the particle trajectories through the
CLAS geometry and the magnetic ﬁeld (including the
mini-torus ﬁeld) and predicted the hit positions on the
detectors. The algorithm was then rerun with the con-
jugate lepton charge, keeping the momentum and scat-
tering angle unchanged. The event was accepted only if
both the actual lepton and its conjugate are both within
the ﬁducial acceptance region and hit a good TOF pad-
dle. Otherwise, the event was rejected.

The angles and the momenta of the lepton and proton
in each event are not independent of each other. These
correlations can potentially interfere with the acceptance
canceling as described in Eqs. 12 and 13. In addition, the
minitorus magnetic ﬁeld, used to deﬂect Moller electrons,
was never reversed. We simulated events using a Monte
Carlo program in order to determine the magnitude of
these eﬀects on our quadruple ratios.

The energy distributions of the incident lepton beams
were taken from a detailed GEANT-4 simulation of the
beamline, including the radiator, convertor, tagger and
chicane magnets, collimators, and shielding. Lepton-
proton elastic scattering events were thrown uniformly
in phase space and then weighted by the cross section.
This allowed us to get a realistic distribution of events
with high statistics for all bins in a reasonable time pe-
riod.

For each bin, we calculated the acceptances for posi-
tive and negative torus ﬁelds and for electron-proton and
positron-proton events separately as the ratio of weighted
reconstructed events (selected with the same analysis
procedure as the data) to weighted generated events:

the superscript refers to the lepton charge. We calculated
the uncertainty for each acceptance using weighted bino-
mial uncertainties and then combined the acceptances to
get the acceptance correction factor as

We then divided the quadruple ratios (Eq. 14) with this
acceptance correction factor.

The acceptance correction factors for the ﬁnal kine-
matic points are shown in Fig. 15. The acceptance cor-
rection factors are all within 0.5% of unity and almost
all are compatible with unity. The statistical uncertain-
ties are all less than or equal to 0.1%. Therefore, the
eﬀects of the minitorus and of lepton-proton kinematic
correlations are very small.

and (cid:104)Q2(cid:105) = 1.44 GeV2, the bin with the largest background.
The other three kinematic cuts have been applied. The box
shows the region of the distribution that was sampled for
background.

There are two leading order corrections that are odd
in the product of the beam and target charges. The ﬁrst
is the TPE contribution (or more correctly, the interfer-
ence between one- and two-photon exchange amplitudes),
which is highly model-dependent, and which we aim to
extract. The second is the interference between real pho-
ton emission from the proton and from the incident or
scattered electron. The latter is considered a background
for this measurement and needs to be computed to isolate
the TPE contribution.

The bremsstrahlung interference term is somewhat
model dependent, as the proton bremsstrahlung contri-
bution has some sensitivity to the proton internal struc-
ture. However, this sensitivity is relatively small and the
amplitude for photon emission from the proton is also
small at low Q2, where the proton is not highly relativis-
tic.

While

the

the key contribution is

charge-odd
bremsstrahlung term, the charge-even terms also need to
be applied, as they dilute the charge-odd term as shown
in Eq. 2. For both contributions, the bremsstrahlung
contributions are typically calculated assuming a ﬁxed
energy loss or W 2 cut used to determine which events
are included as elastic and which are in the excluded
radiative tail.
In our case, we apply our elastic event
identiﬁcation kinematic cuts, rather than a W 2 cut. The
primary diﬀerence between the two approaches is that
our cuts do not remove events where the incoming lep-
ton radiates a photon; this radiation just changes the
incident lepton energy.

We simulated radiative eﬀects following the prescrip-
tion of Ref. [74], taking the “extended peaking approx-
imation” approach. In this approach, radiated photons
are generated only in the directions of the charged par-
ticles, but both the incoming and outgoing lepton and
the struck proton are allowed to radiate. The sum of the

tion for e−p elastic events at (cid:104)ε(cid:105) = 0.40 and (cid:104)Q2(cid:105) = 1.44
GeV2, the bin with the largest background. The other three
kinematic cuts have been applied. Tails of the distribution
to the left of 172◦ and to the right of 188◦ (shown by ver-
tical lines) were ﬁt with a Gaussian function shown in blue.
The ﬁlled red histogram is a scaled background sample from
Fig. 17.

E. Background Subtraction

After applying all event selection cuts some back-
ground remains, particularly at low ε and high Q2. The
background was found to be symmetric about ∆φ = 0
but not symmetric in ∆Pp or ∆E±. Therefore, we used
the ∆φ distributions to determine the background. ∆φ
distributions were made for each bin and for e+p and e−p
events separately. The tails of the ∆φ distributions (over
the regions 160◦ − 172◦ and 188◦ − 200◦) were ﬁt with
a Gaussian. An example of the Gaussian ﬁt is shown in
Fig. 16.

To verify the Gaussian shape of the background, we
used a sampling method to determine the shape of the
background at low ε. The sample was selected from the
right-hand tail of the ∆E− distribution (Fig. 17), and
scaled to match the tails of the ∆φ distributions. The
sampled background shows excellent agreement with the
tails of the ∆φ distribution shown by the red histogram in
Fig. 16. Because the ∆E− peak broadened signiﬁcantly
and the background was much smaller at higher ε, it was
not possible to use the sampling method across all bins
and so the Gaussian ﬁt was employed for all bins.

F. Radiative Corrections

Higher order QED diagrams beyond the Born approx-
imation have a signiﬁcant, but generally well-calculable,
impact on the elastic charged lepton–proton scatter-
ing cross sections. The largest contributions are the
charge-even terms, which are the same for electrons and
positrons. The charge-odd terms cause the diﬀerence be-
tween the positron and electron scattering cross sections
while the charge even terms dilute this diﬀerence.

−radiated photon energy thus has a fairly realistic angular
distribution, as shown in Ref. [74, 75].

The

between

the

diﬀerence

uncorrected

The radiative corrections are applied using the full for-
malism of Ref. [74] for electron–proton scattering, and
then again with the sign of the bremsstrahlung interfer-
ence term changed. The average of these two yield the
bremsstrahlung contribution to δeven, while the ratio of
these yields the charge asymmetry, corresponding to the
no-TPE limit R = 1 − 2(δe.p.brem)/(1 + δeven).
and
radiatively-corrected results, Rmeas − R2γ, where
Rmeas is the experimentally measured equivalent to R
in Eq. 2, and R2γ is shown in Eq. 3, varies from 0.003
at high ε and low Q2 to 0.034 at low ε and high Q2.
Our radiative correction factor at Q2 = 1.45 GeV2
and ε = 0.4 is consistent with the radiative corrections
applied to the Novosibirsk results at similar Q2 and ε
[51].
We divided our measured e+p/e−p cross section ratios
by the calculated ratio of the radiated e+p cross section
to the radiated e−p cross section assuming no TPE. Any
error due to the radiative corrections prescription is likely
to have a correlated eﬀect between diﬀerent kinematics.
Because the correlation is unknown, we approximate this
by applying an overall scale uncertainty of 0.3% (roughly
15% of the correction at the high Q2 kinematics), with
an additional point-to-point uncertainty at each setting
equal to 15% of the correction for that point.

G. Systematic Uncertainties

As discussed earlier, our experimental design helped to
cancel or minimize most of the systematic uncertainties
in the measurement of R2γ. Any remnant systematic
uncertainties are discussed below.

1. CLAS imperfections: We compared our ﬁnal cross
section ratio measured in diﬀerent sectors of CLAS.
The variations in these ratios quantify the system-
atic eﬀects due to detector imperfections. Since we
removed the forward going lepton or proton events
from sector 3, we had ﬁve independent cross-section
ratios for each bin. We calculated the weighted av-
erage and the chi-squared based on the scatter of
the ﬁve independent ratios. We then added the
same systematic uncertainty to each of the sector-
based quadruple ratios and recalculated the chi-
squared and the conﬁdence level. We chose a 0.75%
systematic uncertainty for each sector measure-
ment to give an average conﬁdence level of ∼ 50%
√
for all of the bins. This gives a sector-to-sector over-
all systematic uncertainty of 0.75%/
5 = 0.34%
for each bin except bin 1 as it showed a larger sector
dependence than the other bins. This uncertainty
is listed in Table II under δRsector.

2. Diﬀerences in the e+ and e− luminosities: With
electron-positron pair production being inherently

14

charge symmetric, the e+ and e− beam ﬂuxes
should be identical.
In the experiment, the only
diﬀerences in the two beams could come from dif-
ferences in beam transport from the converter to
the target. The chicane magnet setting was period-
ically reversed several times during the run period
to minimize the diﬀerences and we measured the
energy distributions of the electron and positrons
with TPE Calorimeter after each reversal. Fig. 12
shows that the reconstructed energy distributions
of the incident e+ and e− are identical. Any diﬀer-
ence in the incident lepton ﬂux primarily appears as
the variation in the cross section ratios for the dif-
ferent chicane cycles. The systematic uncertainty
was calculated similarly to that for the CLAS im-
perfections. For each of the independent chicane
cycles we determined the double ratios (Eq. 13).
We added the same systematic uncertainty to each
double ratio to give an average conﬁdence level of
50% for all bins. The overall systematic uncertainty
due to lepton luminosity diﬀerences was estimated
to be 0.3% for each bin.
It is listed in Table II
under δRcycle.

3. Charge independence of track reconstruction: A se-
ries of special runs were conducted with the CLAS
minitorus turned oﬀ in order to make sure that our
track reconstruction and analysis code was inde-
pendent of the charge of the particles. We deter-
mined the number of e+p elastic events for posi-
tive and negative torus settings and a ﬁxed chicane
setting. We then replayed the same runs assum-
ing the opposite torus polarity, thus reversing the
roles of negatively and positively charged tracks,
and determined the number of elastic events where
both particles had a “negative” charge. The analy-
sis found equal numbers of events for the two anal-
yses to within 0.13%, which we have assumed as a
systematic uncertainty associated with the charge
dependence of track reconstruction. It is listed in
Table II under δRtrack.

4. Elastic event selection and background subtraction:
For each bin, the systematic uncertainty due to
elastic event selection cuts was estimated by in-
creasing the width of the kinematic cuts from the
nominal ±3σ cuts to ±3.5σ cuts. Relaxing these
cuts doubled the background present in the data.
Thus the kinematic cut uncertainty includes the
background subtraction uncertainty. The deviation
of the ﬁnal ratio with the varied cuts from the ratio
with the nominal cuts was assigned as the system-
atic uncertainty due to our event selection.
It is
listed in Table II under δRkin.

5. Background ﬁtting: We determined the systematic
uncertainty due to background ﬁtting by varying
the ﬁtting regions from the nominal ﬁtting range.
For each bin, we varied the ﬁtting range by −2◦

6. Target vertex cut: For each bin, the systematic un-
certainty due to the target vertex cut was estimated
by varying the width of the kinematic cuts from
the nominal vertex cut of −44 < vz < −16 cm to
−43 < vz < −17 cm. The deviation of the ﬁnal
ratio with the varied cuts from the ratio with the
nominal cut was assigned as the systematic uncer-
tainty due to the vertex cut. It is listed in Table II
under δRvz.

7. Fiducial cuts: The systematics eﬀect due to the ap-
plied ﬁducial cuts were estimated by increasing the
lower limit of the φ cut by one degree and decreas-
ing the upper limit of φ cut by one degree thereby
reducing the ﬁducial volume. The deviation of the
ﬁnal ratio with the tightened ﬁducial volume from
that with the nominal ﬁducial volume was assigned
as the systematic uncertainty due to our ﬁducial
cuts. It is listed in Table II under δRf id.

8. Acceptance correction: As seen above, the accep-
tance correction factors determined from the Monte

Carlo simulation were close to unity with a high
level of uniformity. We conservatively estimate an
uncertainty of 0.1% for all bins, which is 20% of the
largest deviation of the acceptance correction from
unity. It is listed in Table II under δRacc.

For each bin, the contribution from all the sources were
added in quadrature to obtain our total systematic un-
certainties δRsys. The total uncertainties are presented
along with the ﬁnal results in Table III.

IV. RESULTS

The ﬁnal results are given in Table III along with all
associated uncertainties, and shown in Figs. 18 and 19.
Table III includes both Rmeas, which is the experimen-
tally measured equivalent to R of Eq. 2, and R2γ which is
the δe.p.brem and δeven-corrected result as shown in Eq. 3.
Estimated systematic uncertainties associated with the
δe.p.brem and δeven corrections are also given in the table.
The numbers in the column labeled “overlap” indicate
that a given bin contains part or all of the bins listed in
that column of the table. For example, bin 1 has an over-
lap with part of bin 10, while bin 10 overlaps both bins
1 and 2. The reason for showing data from overlapping
kinematic bins is to separately study the Q2 and ε de-
pendencies, though future use of our results in modeling
TPE corrections should take into account the fact that
we are displaying non-independent results. Quantitative

model comparisons will be discussed in Sec. IV D.

A.

ε-dependence

FIG. 18. (Color online) R2γ as a function of ε at Q2 ≈ 0.85
GeV2 (top) and 1.45 GeV2 (bottom) extracted from the mea-
sured ratio of e+p/e−p cross sections corrected for both δbrem
and δeven. The ﬁlled black squares show the results of this
measurement. The inner error bars are the statistical uncer-
tainties and the outer error bars are the statistical, system-
atic and radiative-correction uncertainties added in quadra-
ture. The line at R2γ = 1 is the limit of no TPE. The ma-
genta solid and red dashed curves show the calculation by
Zhou and Yang [31] including N only and N + ∆ interme-
diate states, respectively. The blue dotted curve shows the
calculation by Blunden et al. [21]. The black dot-dashed line
shows the calculation of TPE eﬀects on a structureless point
proton [20]. The open green circles show the previous world
data at 0.7 ≤ Q2 ≤ 1.0 GeV2 and 1.0 ≤ Q2 ≤ 4.0 GeV2 in
the top and bottom plots, respectively [32]. The ﬁlled blue
diamonds are from VEPP-3 [51] showing the combined statis-
tical and systematic uncertainty. The solid black line in the
lower ﬁgure is a linear ﬁt to the all of the data shown and was
constrained to go to R2γ = 1 at ε = 1.

Fig. 18 shows the ε-dependence of R2γ at Q2 ≈ 0.85
and 1.45 GeV2, along with previous world data and the

16

calculations of Refs. [20, 21, 31]. Our results at Q2 =
0.85 GeV2 are consistent with no epsilon dependence,
though inclusion of the VEPP-3 results at Q2 = 0.83
and 0.976 GeV2 may suggest a slight increase of R2γ
with decreasing ε. Our data at Q2 = 1.45 GeV2 when
combined with the VEPP-3 at Q2 = 1.51 GeV2 result
show a moderate epsilon dependence. Together with the
VEPP-3 data, the results are inconsistent with the no-
TPE (R2γ = 1) limit.

The data are compared to calculations of TPE in a
hadronic framework [21, 31], and the analytic results for
scattering from a structureless (point-like) proton [20].
The data are signiﬁcantly higher than the point-proton
calculation and show the opposite ε dependence. The
data are consistent with the hadronic calculations which,
for the Q2 values presented here, are dominated by
the elastic intermediate state. The hadronic calcula-
tions bring the form factor ratio extracted from Rosen-
bluth separation measurements into good agreement with
the polarization transfer measurements up to Q2 ≈ 2
GeV2 [20], so the data support the explanation of the
discrepancy in terms of TPE contributions. As discussed
in Ref. [18], conﬁrmation that TPE contributions explain
the discrepancy is suﬃcient to allow extraction of the
form factors without a signiﬁcant uncertainty associated
with the TPE corrections.

B. Q2-dependence

Fig. 19 shows the Q2-dependence of the ratio at ε ≈
0.45 and 0.88 along with previous world data and the
calculations of Refs. [20, 21, 31]. In both cases our results
are consistent with little or no Q2 dependence, while the
inclusion of the VEPP-3 data at ε ≈ 0.45 indicates a
gradual increase in R2γ with Q2. As before, the results
are largely consistent with the calculations of Blunden
et al. and Zhou and Yang but not that for a point-like
proton.

C. TPE Corrected Rosenbluth Extraction at

Q2 = 1.75 GeV2

From our results of R2γ at Q2 ≈ 1.45 GeV2 we deter-
mined the correction factor δ2γ (ε). We did a linear ﬁt of
all of the R2γ data shown in Fig. 18 that was constrained
to go to R2γ = 1 at ε = 1. We then applied the resulting
correction factor (see Eq. 4) to the unpolarized reduced
cross section of Andivahis et al. [2] and did a Rosenbluth
separation to extract µpGE/GM at Q2 = 1.75 GeV2.
Figure 20 shows the original reduced cross section mea-
surements from Andivahis et al. and the CLAS TPE cor-
rected values as a function of ε. The TPE corrections
change the proton form factor ratio obtained from the
unpolarized data from µpGE/GM = 0.910 ± 0.060 to
0.837 ± 0.066, bringing it into 1σ agreement with the
polarization transfer result of 0.789± 0.042 at Q2 = 1.77

D. Global Analysis

From Figs. 18 and 19, we can see that our results, com-
bined with the recent VEPP-3 data, favor the hadronic
TPE calculations [21, 31]. Though other calculations of
TPE eﬀects are available (e.g. GPD-based calculations
of ref. [16]), the hadronic calculations are expected to
be more reliable at this low-to-moderate Q2 range. To
make a more quantitative comparison of the TPE calcu-
lations, we perform a global comparison of the data to the
hadronic calculation of Ref.[21], the no-TPE assumption,
and the calculation based on a structureless proton [20].
Our data points and the VEPP-3 measurements have
uncertainties that are at the 0.5-2% level. Previous mea-
surements typically have uncertainties greater than 3%,
and the measurements with better uncertainties are gen-
erally at Q2 < 0.5 GeV2 or ε > 0.7, where the calcula-
tions all suggest minimal TPE contributions. Because of
the large experimental uncertainties leading to low sensi-
tivity, as well as incomplete knowledge of how radiative
corrections were applied to extract R2γ, we do not in-
clude these points in our analysis.

For this analysis, we have to select a subset of our data,
to avoid double counting of data included in more than
one binning scheme. We take the high-Q2 data (bins
5–9) and the high-ε data (bins 14–18, excluding bin 19
which overlaps bins 8 and 9). We also include the two
low-Q2, low-ε data points (bins 1 and 2), which do not
overlap with the bins at high-Q2 or high-ε. This yields
a total of 12 data points from our measurement. For

the Novosibirsk data, we use the four non-normalization
data points, including the 0.3% systematic uncertainty
applied to account for the model-dependence of the high-
ε normalization procedure. The comparison of the CLAS
plus VEPP-3 data (16 data points total) to the various
models is summarized in Table IV. The data are in good
agreement with the hadronic calculations of Ref. [21, 31]
but of insuﬃcient precision to make any deﬁnitive dis-
tinction between them. However, the data exclude the
no-TPE hypothesis at the 4.4σ level, and rule out the
point-proton result at the ∼ 24σ level. The point-proton
result has sometimes been used to approximate TPE cor-
rections at low Q2 values [58]. The ﬁt includes a varia-
tion of the normalization uncertainty associated with the
model dependence of the radiative corrections, which in-
creases all of the CLAS ratios by roughly 0.3% for the ﬁt
to the hadronic calculation and decreases it by a similar
amount for the point-like comparison.

FIG. 19. (Color online) Same as Fig. 18 except as a function
of Q2 at ε ≈ 0.45 (top) and 0.88 (bottom). Also included
is the CLAS 2013 [34] result (black open square), which has
been averaged to a single point at ε = 0.893. The open green

the proton electric form factor discrepancy up to Q2 ≈ 2
GeV2. We look forward to the OLYMPUS results, which
will check the existing measurements and extend them to
slightly higher momentum transfer. However, the form
factor discrepancy is small at the low momentum trans-
fers of the new data. Though there are currently no ex-
periments planned to extend the measurements to Q2 ≥ 3
GeV2, where the form-factor discrepancy is the largest,
such experiments are needed before one can deﬁnitively
state that TPE eﬀects are the reason for the discrepancy.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Our results, along with recently published results from
VEPP-3, rule out the zero TPE eﬀect hypothesis at the
99.4% conﬁdence level and are in excellent agreement
(χ2
ν = 1.03 to 1.09) with the calculations [21, 31] that
include TPE eﬀects and largely reconcile the form-factor
discrepancy. The combined world data are consistent
with an increase in R2γ with decreasing ε at Q2 ≈ 0.85
and 1.45 GeV2. A slight, non-statistically signiﬁcant,
increase in R2γ with Q2 is seen. Extracting the ε-
dependent TPE correction factor, δ2γ (ε), from our re-
sults for R2γ at Q2 ≈ 1.45 GeV2 and applying it to the
extraction of µpGE/GM at Q2 = 1.75 GeV2 from the
Ref. [2] reduced cross-section data brings it into good
agreement with the polarization transfer measurement
at Q2 = 1.77 GeV2 by Punjabi et al. [7].
