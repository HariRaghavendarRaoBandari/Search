ABSTRACT

We report on a 120 ks Chandra/HETG spectrum of the black hole GRS 1915+105. The observation was
made during an extended and bright soft state in June, 2015. An extremely rich disk wind absorption spectrum
is detected, similar to that observed at lower sensitivity in 2007. The very high resolution of the third-order
spectrum reveals four components to the disk wind in the Fe K band alone; the fastest has a blue-shift of
v = 0.03c. Broadened re-emission from the wind is also detected in the ﬁrst-order spectrum, giving rise to clear
accretion disk P Cygni proﬁles. Dynamical modeling of the re-emission spectrum gives wind launching radii
of r ≃ 102- 4 GM/c2. Wind density values of n ≃ 1013- 16 cm- 3 are then required by the ionization parameter
emergent magnetic ﬁeld to be B ≃ 103- 4 Gauss if the wind is driven via magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pressure
from within the disk, and B ≃ 104- 5 Gauss if the wind is driven by magnetocentrifugal acceleration. The MHD
estimates are below upper limits predicted by the canonical α-disk model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). We
discuss these results in terms of fundamental disk physics and black hole accretion modes.

for magnetic driving. With simple, reasonable assumptions, the wind properties constrain the magnitude of the

1. INTRODUCTION

Disk accretion onto stellar-mass black holes at high Edding-
ton fractions is dominated by thermal emission from an accre-
tion disk. This blackbody-like emission can be characterized
extremely well with just two parameters: ﬂux, and color tem-
perature. This simplicity enables efﬁcient traces of disk tem-
perature across orders of magnitude in ﬂux (e.g. Reynolds &
Miller 2013), but it hides the underlying physics that mediate
the accretion process.

The magneto-rotational instability (MRI; Balbus & Haw-
ley 1991) appears to supply the degree of effective viscosity
required to drive disk accretion. Alternatively, gas might es-
cape along poloidal magnetic ﬁeld lines, transferring angular
momentum and allowing mass transfer through the disk (e.g.,
Blandford & Payne 1982). Accretion in FU Ori and T Tauri
systems suggests that these mechanisms might operate con-
currently: thermal continuum emission signals a viscous disk,
but the proﬁles observed in line spectra signal a rotating disk
wind (e.g., Calvet, Kenyon, & Hartmann 1993). If young stel-
lar disks are any guide, line spectra and winds may hold the

key to understanding disks around black holes.

Miller et al. (2015) recently examined the richest disk winds
found in Chandra/HETG spectra of the stellar-mass black
holes 4U 1630- 472, H 1743- 322, GRO J1655- 40, and GRS
1915+105. The observations were obtained in the disk–
dominated “high/soft” or “thermal dominant” state (see, e.g.,
Remillard & McClintock 2006). The Fe K band was found
to require 2–3 velocity/ionization components when ﬁt with
new, self-consistent XSTAR photoionization models. The
spectra also require re-emission from the dense absorbing gas,
and the emission is broadened by a degree that is loosely con-
sistent with Keplerian orbital motion at the photoionization
radius. This provides a means of estimating wind launch-
ing radii, densities, outﬂow rates, kinetic power, and driving
mechanisms.
The observation of GRS 1915+105 treated in Miller et al.
(2015) was obtained during an extended soft state in 2007
(also see Ueda et al. 2009, Neilsen & Lee 2009).
In the
spring of 2015, GRS 1915+105 was observed to be in a
long decline in the SWIFT/BAT (15–50 keV). The source
ﬂux eventually became consistent with zero in single visits,
indicating that GRS 1915+105 had again locked into a steady
soft state. We therefore triggered an approved Chandra target
of opportunity (TOO) observation of GRS 1915+105.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTION

GRS 1915+105 was observed for 120 ks starting on 2015
June 9 at 15:30:59 UT ("obsid" 16711), using the HETGS.
Owing to the high ﬂux level expected in the Chandra band,
the ACIS-S array was read-out in "continuous clocking" mode
to prevent photon pile-up, reducing the nominal frame time to
just 2.85 ms. A 100-column "gray" ﬁlter was applied across
the full height of the S3 chip, windowing the zeroth-order
aimpoint. Within this window, one in 10 events was teleme-
tered; this enables the wavelength grid to be reconstructed
while preserving telemetry.

ﬁles were used to generate spectral ﬁles and responses. The
tool "add_grating_orders" was used to combine opposing
spectra from the ﬁrst and third orders. Redistribution matri-
ces were created using the tool "mkgrmf" and the ancillary
responses were created using "mkgarf".

The Fe K band traces the mostly highly ionized gas, likely
originating closest to the black hole. Following Miller et al.
(2015), we proceed to only analyze the combined third-order
HEG spectrum in the 5–8 keV band (above 8 keV, order sort-
ing becomes difﬁcult and stray ﬂux enters the extraction re-
gion), and the combined ﬁrst-order HEG spectrum over the
5–10 keV band.

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

Models were ﬁt to the data using XSPEC version 12.8.2
(Arnaud 1996). In all of the ﬁts, "Churazov" weighting (Chu-
razov et al. 1996) was adopted. All of the errors reported in
this work are 1σ conﬁdence intervals.
An equivalent neutral hydrogen column density of NISM =
4.0 × 1022 cm- 2 was assumed in all ﬁts and modeled using

“tbabs” (Wilms et al. 2000). Fits to the ﬁrst-order spectrum
conﬁrmed that the continuum can be well described with disk
blackbody (Mitsuda et al. 1984) and power-law components.
The kT ≃ 1.6 keV thermal emission dominates over the steep
(Γ ≃ 2.8) power-law (see Table 1). This characterization of
the ﬁrst-order spectrum gives an unabsorbed ﬂux of F ≃ 4.1×
10- 8 erg cm- 2 s- 1 in the 0.5–30.0 keV band, corresponding to
a luminosity of L ≃ 3.7× 1038 erg s- 1 for d = 8.6 kpc (Reid et

al. 2014).

In order to characterize the the wind, we generated a grid of
photoionized line spectra using XSTAR version 2.2.1bo8 (see,
e.g., Kallman et al. 2009). This (newest) version of the code
includes the effects of resonant scattering when calculating
emission spectra, in addition to recombination, ﬂuorescence,
and collisional ionization. A blackbody input spectrum with

kT = 1.6 keV and L = 3.7×1038 erg s- 1 was assumed. Follow-
ing Miller et al. (2015), a turbulent velocity of 300 km s- 1, so-
lar abundances (except for iron, ﬁxed at twice the solar value
as per Lee et al. 2002), a covering factor of Ω/4π = 0.5, and
a gas density of n = 1014 cm- 3 were assumed. Via the "xs-
tar2xspec" function, 400 photoionization models were cre-
ated, spanning a range of 6.0 × 1021 cm- 2 ≤ N ≤ 6.0 × 1023,
and 3.0 ≤ log(ξ) ≤ 6.0. The resolution of the models was set
to give 100,000 spectral bins.
Photoionized absorption was included in the overall model
as a multiplicative component acting upon the continuum. It
was characterized in terms of a column density, ionization
parameter, and velocity shift (NH,wind, ξ = L/nr2, and v/c).
Self-consistency demands an additive re-emission component
for each absorption component. The column density and ion-
ization parameter were linked between the absorption and re-
emission components in each zone. The emission component
carries a ﬂux normalization, given by K = (Ω/4π) L38/d2
kpc
(where L38 is the luminosity in units of 1038 erg s- 1 and dkpc
is the distance in units of kpc). Normalization values were
restricted to the 0.1–10.0 range. The re-emission spectra are
consistent with a gas at zero velocity shift, per emission from
a broad range of azimuth in a cylindrical geometry. Emission
velocity shifts were then ﬁxed at zero.

The re-emission is broadened, and is expected to have
a non-Gaussian shape if it originates from several hundred
or several thousand radii. We therefore convolved each re-
emission component with the “rdblur” function (Fabian et al.

1989). This Schwarzschild function differs negligibly from
the anticipated (see, e.g., McClintock et al. 2006, Miller et al.
2013) near-maximal Kerr potential far from the black hole,
and its range extends to the launching radii whereas newer
Kerr blurring functions do not. The inclination was jointly
determined between all zones (restricted to the 60◦ ≤ θ ≤ 80◦
range). Tests revealed that a constant density emissivity pro-
ﬁle (r- 2) gave the best ﬁts, with the outer radius ﬁxed at a
multiple of the inner radius for all zones. A value of 5.0 gave
the lowest ﬁt statistic (Rout = 5.0 × Rin), and values reported
in Table 1 reﬂect ﬁts made with this scheme. Last, a Gaus-
sian emission feature with an energy constrained to lie in the
6.40–6.43 keV range (Fe I-XVII) was included to account for
any distant, low-ionization emission.

Initial ﬁts were made to the ﬁrst and third-order spectra sep-
arately. A model with three zones is able to reproduce the
lines in the third-order spectrum below 7 keV, and even an H-
like absorption doublet blue-shifted by approximately 0.01 c,
up to 7.05 keV. However, a weak H-like doublet is apparent at
approximately 7.2 keV. We therefore included a fourth zone
in ﬁts to the third-order spectrum, measuring a blue-shift of
v = 0.0305(4) c.

We next made joint ﬁts to the ﬁrst-order and third-order
spectra. The continuum in the ﬁrst-order spectrum is robust
and reported in Table 1, but the continuum in the third-order
is affected by stray continuum ﬂux, so the continuum param-
eters and column densities are not linked between the two
spectra. The ﬁrst-order spectrum is generally more sensitive
and the parameters of the third-order wind model were tied
to those for the ﬁrst-order spectrum, with the exception of
the third and fourth zones, which carry higher velocity shifts.
For those zones, the velocity is determined by the third-order
spectrum.

The best-ﬁt model is detailed in Table 1. The ﬁts are shown
in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 3 illustrates that the re-emission
spectrum is broadened. Last, Figure 4 compares the 2007 and
2015 spectra of the high/soft state in GRS 1915+105. Over-
all, a good ﬁt is achieved, with χ2/ν = 1951.2/1572 = 1.241.
Each zone is required by the data, as measured by the F-
statistic. The best two-zone model is an enormous (>> 8σ)
improvement over the best single-zone model. The best three-
zone model is a 5σ improvement over any ﬁt with just two
zones. The addition of the fourth zone is a 3σ improvement
over any three-zone model. Re-emission from Zone 3 is not
highly broadened, suggesting a more distant origin. The re-
emission from Zone 4 is not well-constrained, and was ﬁxed at
a representative value of K = 0.5. In general, the re-emission
normalizations should be regarded as relative scaling factors,
since they are partially affected by small continuum dispari-
ties between the ﬁrst and third-order spectra.

The slower components of the wind (Zones 1 and 2 in Ta-
ble 1) have lower ionizations and higher densities; in contrast,
the faster components (Zones 3 and 4 in Table 1) have higher
ionizations, and lower densities. This may be consistent with
acceleration within the absorbing region. However, the fastest
component - Zone 4 - appears to originate at small radii. The
wind is likely inconsistent with a homogeneous ﬂow with uni-
form acceleration, but it may be consistent with a complex
ﬂow with multiple stream lines.

Table 1 also gives estimates of the gas density, mass out-
ﬂow rate, kinetic power, and ﬁlling factor in each wind zone.
The gas density was obtained through the ionization param-
eter (ξ = L/nr2), utilizing the radius implied by the broad-

GRS 1915+105

ening of the re-emission. The mass outﬂow rate is esti-
mated without assuming a density by utilizing L/ξ = nr2,
giving ˙Mwind = Ωµmpv(L/ξ). The kinetic power is then just
Lkin = 0.5 ˙Mwindv2. It is notable that the outﬂow rate is com-
parable to the accretion rate in the inner disk in Zones 2, 3,
and 4. Summing all zones, the kinetic power of the wind is
nominally about 0.1% of the radiative power. The thickness
of each wind zone can be estimated via ∆r = N/n, and the
volume ﬁlling factor is then given by f = ∆r/r. Table 1 gives
estimates of f for each zone. Depending on the geometry, it
may or may not be appropriate to multiply the mass outﬂow
rates and kinetic power by f , reducing both quantities. The
best ﬁts are obtained when ∆r/r = 5 in the blurring function;
this may indicate that the ﬁlling factor is not very small.
Radiative line driving is only effective for log(ξ) ≤ 3 (Proga
2003);
the wind cannot be driven in this manner. Ther-
mal driving is effective outside of the Comptonization radius,
RC = 1010 × (MBH/(M⊙)/TC,8 cm (where TC,8 is the Compton
temperature in units of 108 K; Begelman et al. 1983). Other
work suggests that winds can be driven from 0.1 RC (Woods
et al. 1996; also see Proga & Kallman 2002). Approximat-
ing the Compton temperature with the disk temperature (rea-
sonable under equilibrium conditions), RC ≃ 5 × 1011 cm, or
3.3× 105 GM/c2. Thus, RC is 2–3 orders of magnitude larger
than implied by the broadening of the re-emission spectra of
Zones 1, 2, and 4 (see Table 1). The wind densities and out-
ﬂow rates also exceed estimates from thermal driving mod-
els, though such models are evolving (e.g., Higginbottom &
Proga 2015). Emission line broadening might arise via turbu-
lent motions in thermal winds (e.g., Sim et al. 2010). How-
ever, this would lead to similar line widths in emission and
absorption, whereas the emission lines are much broader than
the absorption lines in our best-ﬁt model (see Figure 3).

If the wind is driven by MHD pressure (e.g., Proga et
al. 2003), the magnetic pressure must equal or exceed the
gas pressure in the wind, meaning that B2/8π = 2nkT , or
B = √16πnkT. If magnetocentrifugal driving (Blandford &
Payne 1982) dominates, the magnetic ﬁeld pressure must
equal or exceed the ram pressure of the wind (else the poloidal
ﬁeld geometry will break down), giving B2/8π = 0.5ρv2
tot, or
B = q4πµmpnv2
tot (where vtot includes radial and azimuthal
velocities). We ran new XSTAR models assuming the derived
densities to ascertain the temperature within the wind; these
temperatures and the magnetic ﬁeld magnitudes are listed in
Table 1. Using equation 2.19 in Shakura & Sunyaev (1973),
limits on the magnetic ﬁeld strength expected in the α-disk
prescription were calculated; these are also listed in Table 1.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have obtained a sensitive Chandra/HETGS observation
of the black hole GRS 1915+105, in an extended soft state.
The spectrum shows strong absorption lines in the Fe K band,
and weaker, broadened emission lines, together creating ac-
cretion disk P Cygni proﬁles (see Figures 1–4). Four distinct
wind zones are detected in ﬁts to the ﬁrst and third-order spec-
tra; the fastest has a blue shift of v = 0.03c. The broadening
of the re-emission components of the wind permits measure-
ments of its launching radius (R ≃ 102- 4 GM/c2), which in
turn allow for estimates of the wind density (n ≃ 1013- 16 cm- 3)

and other parameters. The wind is likely driven by magnetic
processes, connecting the wind to fundamental aspects of disk

accretion, including momentum and mass transfer.
Though luminosities can be difﬁcult to estimate even for X-
ray binaries, we observed GRS 1915+105 at an apparent lumi-
nosity of L = 0.28 LEdd, assuming the most recent estimates of
its distance and mass. This is signiﬁcant because simulations
suggest that standard thin accretion disks operate at this Ed-
dington fraction (e.g., Shafee et al. 2008, Reynolds & Fabian
2008). Simulations ﬁnd that winds might be Compton-thick
very close to the disk, but do not remain so as the gas moves
upward and outward (Chakravorty et al. 2016). It is possi-
ble but unlikely that a Compton-thick, super-Eddington ﬂow
was observed in GRS 1915+105; all of the column densities
measured in Table 1 are signiﬁcantly below NH = 1024 cm- 2,
and the total kinetic power of the wind is only a small fraction
(≃ 0.1%) of the radiated luminosity.
Wind rotation might nominally favor magnetocentrifugal
driving (Blandford & Payne 1982), but rotation is not neces-
sarily unique to this mechanism. Moreover, a low ﬁlling fac-
tor may be required in order to hold the mass outﬂow rate be-
low the accretion inﬂow rate (else the wind transfers more an-
gular momentum than the disk can supply; see, e.g., Reynolds
2012). Velocity proﬁles can shed additional light: if an MHD
wind is a momentum-conserving ﬂow, then azimuthal veloc-

ity should decrease linearly (v ∝ R- 1); however, in the magne-
tocentrifugal case, azimuthal velocity increases linearly with
radius (v ∝ R). Associating observed blue-shifts with local es-
cape speeds gives a poor radius estimate (effectively an upper
limit). Our results reveal no trend between rotational broaden-
ing (traced by the radius estimate from blurring with “rdblur”)
and radius (poorly traced by outﬂow speed). This is consistent
with a combination of MHD and magnetocentrifugal driving;
the wind would then fail to conserve momentum and transfer
some away from the disk, aiding mass transfer through the
disk.

The magnetic ﬁeld estimates made assuming that MHD
pressure drives the wind are safely below the limits predicted
by α-disk models (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; see Table 1).
This may offer new support for the basic framework of α-disk
models, at least in the inner disk in stellar-mass black holes.
Moreover, the magnetic energy ﬂux predicted in MRI disk
simulations by Miller & Stone (2000) appears sufﬁcient to
power the wind launched in the soft state of GRS 1915+105.
The equatorial nature of this disk wind (and others) is also
consistent with simulations of MHD winds; indeed, the in-
ferred wind parameters (such as density) closely resemble
some values obtained in Proga et al. (2003). Chakravorty
et al. (2016) simulated MHD winds in X-ray binaries and
found that magnetic winds are possible at small radii for high
densities and high ionizations; this appears to conﬁrm AGN-
focused studies of MHD ﬂows (e.g., Fukumura et al. 2014,
2015). In the broadest sense, magnetic ﬁeld constraints from
disk winds may mark a turning point in our ability to probe
fundamental disk physics, and the start of closer comparisons
between observations and simulations.

Observations indicate that winds and jets are anti-correlated
by spectral state (e.g., Miller et al. 2006a,b,2008; Neilsen &
Lee 2009, King et al. 2012, Ponti et al. 2012). This may also
indicate a link between disk properties, magnetic ﬁeld conﬁg-
urations, and outﬂow modes. Begleman et al. (2015) have
proposed an association between the spectral state and the
structure of the dynamo based on an analytic description of
magnetically dominated disks supported by shearing box sim-
ulations (Salvesen et al. 2016). The close similarity in wind

4
properties in soft states of GRS 1915+105 separated by eight
years signals an even closer relationship between the state of
the disk and the nature of the wind that is launched (see Fig-
ure 4). An intriguing possibility is that winds may act to partly

J. M. Miller et al.

regulate the operation of the disk. Obtaining sensitive spectra
at a high cadence could detect changes in the wind and disk
continuum, and determine which geometry leads variations.

FIG. 1.— The third-order spectrum of GRS 1915+105. The best-ﬁt model based on joint ﬁts to the ﬁrst and third-order spectra is shown in red (see Table 1).
Four photoionization zones with paired absorption and re-emission are required to ﬁt the data. The He-like Fe XXV line is resolved into intercombination and
resonance lines (rest frame energy: 6.700 keV). Instances of H-like Fe XXVI absorption lines close to the rest-frame value of 6.970 keV, and blue-shifted up to
7.05 keV and 7.2 keV are apparent. The Fe XXVI line shape is a doublet owing to the expected spin-orbit splitting in the H-like atom.

FIG. 3.— Dynamical broadening plays an important role in shaping the re-emission spectrum of the wind. Zones 1–4 are depicted in red, green, blue, and
magenta, respectively. Left: Dynamical broadening has been removed from the model in Table 1, yielding wind re-emission lines that are much sharper than the
data. Right: The spectral model detailed in Table 1, with the blurring required by the data.

FIG. 4.— First-order HEG spectra of GRS 1915+105 from the soft states observed in 2007 and 2015. The spectra are shown as a ratio to the best-ﬁt continuum,
with the best-ﬁt wind spectrum plotted through the ratio. In this representation, the presence of accretion disk P Cygni line proﬁles is clear. Top: Data from the
2007 soft state, with the model of Miller et al. (2015). Middle: Data from the 2015 soft state, with the corresponding best-ﬁt model (see Figure 2 and Table 1).
Bottom: The 2007 and 2015 data and respective models are plotted together. The similarity of the spectra suggests that a particular wind geometry manifests in
soft states.

NOTE. — Results of ﬁts to the ﬁrst- and third-order spectra. The orders were ﬁt jointly, allowing the third-order spectra to have a ﬁducial continuum, and
to set the velocity shifts for Zones 3 and 4; all other parameters pertain to the ﬁrst-order spectrum. The photoionized wind spectrum is modeled using XSTAR
(parameters include the column density NH and ionizaton paramter ξ). Each zone consists of absorption paired with re-emission. The re-emission component has
zero net shift, and is blurred with the “rdblur” function to measure dynamical broadening (giving the radius R, and inclination θ). The absorption component is
shifted by v and negative values indicate blue-shifts; the re-emission component also carries an overall ﬂux normalization. Below the model parameters, estimates
of the wind properties are given for each zone, including the gas density (n), mass outﬂow rate ( ˙Mwind), kinetic power (Lkin), volume ﬁlling factor ( f ), temperature
(Twind), and estimates of the magnetic ﬁeld strength required to launch the wind via MHD processes (e.g., MRI) within the disk (BMHD) or magnetocentrifugal
driving (BMCF ). The ratio of the mass loss rate to mass accretion rate was calculated assuming an efﬁciency of η = 0.1. A limit on the ﬁeld strength predicted by
α-disk models (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) is also given (Bα); the range reﬂects the full range of radii for each zone. Values with an asterisk were frozen. The
overall model gives χ2/ν = 1951.2/1572 = 1.241. Please refer to the text for more details.
