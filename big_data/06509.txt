Quantum work is usually determined from two projective measurements of the energy at the beginning
and at the end of a thermodynamic process. However, this paradigm cannot be considered thermodynami-
cally consistent as it does not account for the thermodynamic cost of these measurements. To remedy this
conceptual inconsistency we introduce a novel paradigm that relies only on the expected change of the av-
erage energy given the initial energy eigenbasis. In particular, we completely omit quantum measurements
in the deﬁnition of quantum work, and hence quantum work is identiﬁed as a thermodynamic quantity of
only the system. As main results we derive a modiﬁed quantum Jarzynski equality and a sharpened maxi-
mum work theorem in terms of the information free energy. Comparison of our results with the standard
approach allows to quantify the informational cost of projective measurements.

In classical mechanics and thermodynamics work is de-
termined by a functional of a force along a trajectory in
phase space [1–3]. For quantum systems the situation is
much more subtle, since trajectories simply do not exist
and a hermitian work operator cannot be deﬁned [4, 5].
Rather, quantum work is commonly determined as the dif-
ference between two energies projectively measured at two
times: one at the beginning and one at the end of a ther-
modynamic process [6, 7]. Despite the obvious limitations
of this notion – no truly open systems can be described
since the change of internal energy comprises only work,
but no heat – the two-time energy measurement approach
has proven to be practical and powerful. For instance, this
approach has led to the experimental veriﬁcation of quan-
tum ﬂuctuation theorems [8, 9] and the development of heat
engines at the nanoscale [10–13].

Nevertheless, quantum work has remained somewhat
elusive with many peculiar features and open questions
[14, 15]. For instance, it has only recently been pointed out
that work can be measured at a single (ﬁnal) time by means
of a generalized measurement [16], that its probability dis-
tribution can be interferometrically estimated [17–20], that
it reduces to the classical notion of thermodynamic work in
high-temperature [21] and semi-classical [22] limits, and
that the paradigm of two-time energy measurements is also
applicable to open systems as long as the dynamics is unital
[23], see Refs. [24–30].

In the following we will motivate and introduce a new
deﬁnition of quantum work based on a proper characteri-
zation of the the role of quantum measurements – a fea-
ture not present in semi-classical limits [22]. Imagine the
typical situation for which the quantum Jarzynski equal-
ity is valid [3]: at t = 0 the system is prepared in a
Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, ρ0 ∝ exp (−βH0), where
H0 is the initial Hamiltonian and β denotes the inverse
temperature. Then the density operator ρ0 is diagonal in

energy basis, and the projective measurement of the en-
ergy simply determines the thermal occupation probabili-
ties p(n0) ∝ exp (−β(n0)). After the ﬁrst measurement,
the system evolves under a time-dependent Hamiltonian
H(t) from t = 0 to t = τ, and the ﬁnal state, ρτ , is typ-
ically a complicated nonequilibrium state [31–33]. Gener-
ally, ρτ is not diagonal in the energy basis, and therefore
a projective measurement of the energy is accompanied by
a back-action on the system [34]. In many realistic situa-
tions one does not have to worry too much about this back-
action. Experimentally it poses a real challenge to fully
isolate a quantum system from its environment, and hence
almost all, real quantum systems quickly decohere [35, 36].
Interestingly, the energybasis can be superselected by the
environment [37], and hence ρτ quickly becomes close to
diagonal in energy eigenbasis.

For fast processes – faster than the time-scales over
which decoherence happens – or small systems, however,
ρτ is not diagonal, which has been seen explicitely, e.g.,
in the ion trap experiment by An et al. [9]. In such situ-
ations the back-action of the measurement on the system
does play a role and results in an increase of von-Neumann
entropy of the system, i.e., in a change of information. In-
formation, however, is a thermodynamic resource, which
can be related to a free energy usable to perfrom additional
work [38, 39]. Hence, one would expect this additional
(information) free energy to explicitly show up in the ther-
modynamic relations [40, 41]. However, in the standard
treatment [5] and in experiments [8, 9] this informational
back-action of the second projective measurement has not
been considered, and hence the paradigm of two-time mea-
surements is thermodynamically incomplete.

In our analysis we will address this issue and resolve the
conceptual inconstency arising from neglecting the infor-
mational contribution to the laws of thermodynamics. This
will lead to a new notion of quantum work, which relies

only on the internal energy as an avarge of the time-evolved
energy eigenstates. We will see that this notion is in full
agreement with the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics – the av-
erage work is given by the change of internal energy – but
that we can also quantify the informational contribution to
the free energy from projective measurements. As a main
result we will derive a modiﬁed quantum Jarzynski equal-
ity and an associated maximum work theorem, in which the
thermodynamic free energy is replaced by the information
free energy [39, 42–44].

Two-time measurements – notions and issues We be-
gin by brieﬂy reviewing the paradigm of the two-time en-
ergy measurement approach, and establish notions and no-
tations. Here and in the following we consider an isolated
quantum system with time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, i| ˙ψt(cid:105) = Ht |ψt(cid:105). We are interested in describ-
ing thermodynamic processes that are induced by vary-
ing an external control parameter λt during time τ, with
Ht = H(λt).

Commonly quantum work is determined by the follow-
ing, experimentally motivated protocol: After preparation
of the initial state ρ0 a projective measurement of the en-
ergy is performed; then the system is allowed to evolve un-
der the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation, before a sec-
ond projective energy measurement is performed at t = τ.
For the sake of simplicity and to avoid clutter in the for-
mulas we further assume that the system is initially pre-
pared in a Gibbs state, ρ0 = exp (−βH0)/Z0, where
β is the inverse temperature and Z0 is the partition func-
tion, Z0 = tr{exp (−βH0)}. Strictly speaking the pro-
jective measurement at t = 0 is superﬂuous for initially
thermal states, since such ρ0s are diagonal in the energy
basis. The internal energy of the system, and therefore
the full thermodynamic behavior, can simply be deter-
mined by an average over all energy eigenstates equipped
with the thermal occupation probabilities [45], p(n0) =
exp (−β (n0, λ0))/Z0.

time evolution operator, Uτ = T> exp(cid:0)−i/(cid:82) τ

The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics determines that the
average work is given by the change of internal energy,
(cid:104)W(cid:105) = tr{ρτ Hτ} − tr{ρ0 H0}, where Uτ is the unitary
0 dt Ht
and T> denotes time-ordering. Accordingly, for a single
realization of the two-time measurement protocol the quan-
tum work reads

(cid:1),

Wn0→nτ = (nτ , λτ ) − (n0, λ0) ,

(1)
where |n0(cid:105) is the initial eigenstate with eigenenergy
(n0, λ0) and |nτ(cid:105) with (nτ , λτ ) describes the ﬁnal en-
ergy eigenstate.

The corresponding quantum work probability distribu-
tion (2) is then given by an average over an ensemble of re-
alizations of this protocol, P(W ) = (cid:104)δ (W − Wn0→nτ )(cid:105),
which can be written as [18, 46]

P(W ) =

δ (W − Wn0→nτ ) p (n0; nτ ) .

In the latter equation the symbol (cid:80)(cid:82) denotes a sum over

p (n0; nτ ) = tr(cid:8)Πnτ Uτ Πn0 U†

the discrete part of the eigenvalues spectrum and an inte-
gral over the continuous part. In Eq. (2) p (n0; nτ ) are the
joint probabilities for detecting n0 and nτ in the two energy
measurements [18, 27, 46],

(3)
where, Πn denotes the projector into the space spanned
by the nth eigenstate, which becomes for non-degenerate
spectra Πn = |n(cid:105)(cid:104)n|. It is then a simple exercise to show
that from the deﬁnition of P(W ) (2) we have the quantum
Jarzynski equality [4, 5],

where ∆F = Fτ − F0 and Ft = −(1/β) ln (Zt).

Neglected informational cost Generally the ﬁnal state
ρτ is a complicated nonequilibrium state. This means,
in particular, that ρτ does not commute with the ﬁnal
Hamiltonian Hτ , and one has to consider the back-action
on the system due to the projective measurement of the
energy [34]. For a single measurement, Πnτ , the post-
measurement state is given by Πnτ ρτ Πnτ . Thus, the sys-
tem can be found on average in

(cid:10)e−βW(cid:11) =

Accordingly, the ﬁnal measurement of the energy is accom-
panied by a change of information, i.e., by a change of the
von Neumann entropy of the system

(cid:1)(cid:9)+tr{ρτ ln (ρτ )} ≥ 0 . (6)

∆HM = −tr(cid:8)ρM

Information, however,
is physical [47] and its change
“costs” work. This additional work has to be paid by the
external observer – the measurement device. In a fully con-
sistent thermodynamic framework this cost has to be taken
into consideration [38] – in particular when calculating the
efﬁciency of thermodynamic devices [10, 11].

Quantum work without measurements To remedy this
conceptual inconsistency arising from neglecting the in-
formational contribution of the projective measurements,
we propose an alternative paradigm. For isolated systems
quantum work is clearly given by the change of internal en-
ergy. As a statement of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics this
holds true no matter whether the systems is measured or
not. Quantum measurements, however, can be understood
as an interaction with a “measuring environment”. How-
ever, almost any environment induces decoherence [36].
Thus, deﬁning work with the help of the environment and
ignoring the effect of decoherence is as thermodynamically
inconsistent as deﬁning work via an external measurement
and neglecting the informational cost of these projective
measurements.

For thermal states measuring the energy is superﬂuous
as state and energy commute. Hence, a notion of quantum
work can be formulated that is fully based on the time-
evolution of energy eigenstates [48]. Quantum work for a

(cid:102)Wn0 ≡ (cid:104)n0| U†

single realization is then determined by considering how
much the expectation value for a single energy eigenstate
changes under the unitary evolution. Hence, we deﬁne

τ Hτ Uτ |n0(cid:105) − (n0, λ0) .

(7)
We can easily verify that the so deﬁned quantum work (7),
indeed, fulﬁlls with the ﬁrst law. To this end, we compute

the average work (cid:104)W(cid:105)(cid:101)P for the modiﬁed quantum work
distribution (cid:101)P(W ), and we obtain,
(cid:104)W(cid:105)(cid:101)P =
τ Hτ Uτ |n0(cid:105) p(n0) − tr{ρ0 H0}

(cid:88)(cid:90)

(cid:104)n0| U†

= tr{ρτ Hτ} − tr{ρ0 H0} = (cid:104)W(cid:105) .

(8)
It is important to note that the average quantum work deter-
mined from two-time energy measurements is identical to
the (expected) value given only knowledge from an a single
measurement at t = 0. Most importantly, however, in our
paradigm the external observer does not have to pay a ther-
modynamic cost associated with the change of information
due to measurements. Hence, the present paradigm can be
considered thermodynamically consistent and complete.

Modiﬁed quantum Jarzynski equality What we have
seen so far is that the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is im-
mune to whether the energy of the system is measured or
not, since projective measurements of the energy do not af-
fect the internal energy. However, the informational con-
tent of the system of interest, i.e., the entropy crucially
depends on whether the system is measured. Therefore,
we expect that the statements of the second law have to be
modiﬁed to reﬂect the informational contribution [38]. In
our paradigm the modiﬁed quantum work distribution be-
comes

where as before p(n0) = exp (−β (n0, λ0))/Z0. Now,
we can compute the average exponentiated work,

the best possible guess for a thermal state of the ﬁnal sys-
tem given only the time-evolved energy eigenbasis. This

In information theory the “quality” of such a best pos-

(17)

where we used (cid:104)W(cid:105)(cid:101)P = (cid:104)W(cid:105) (8).

Equations (16) and (17) are our main results. By deﬁning
quantum work as an average over time-evolved eigenstates
we obtain a modiﬁed quantum Jarzynski equality (16) and
a generalized maximum work theorem (17), in which the
thermodynamic cost of projevtive measurements becomes
apparent. These results become even more transparent by
noting that similar versions of the maximum work theorem
have been derived in the thermodynamics of information
[38, 39, 42]. In this context it has proven useful to intro-
duce the notion of an information free energy,

(cid:101)Fτ = Fτ + S((cid:101)ρτ||ρeq

τ ) .

(18)

4

This free energy is a true thermodynamic quantity [39, 42]
that accounts for the additional capacity of a thermody-
namic system to perform work due to information [38].
Hence, we can rewrite Eq. (17) as

β (cid:104)W(cid:105) ≥ β ∆(cid:101)F .

(19)

Equation (20) constitutes a sharper bound than the usual
maximum work theorem, and it accounts for the extra free
energy available to the system. This extra free energy ex-
presses the thermodynamic cost of the projective measure-
ments, and hence our treatment can be considered thermo-
dynamically consistent and complete.

Illustrative example: parametric harmonic oscillator
For the remainder of this discussion we will turn to an
analytically solvable example, namely the parametric har-
monic oscillator,

H = p2/2m + mω2

t x2/2 .

(20)

This system has been studied extensively in the literature,
and it can be shown that the average work performed by
changing the angular frequency from ω0 to ωτ is given by
[21, 31]

(cid:104)W(cid:105) = /2 (Q∗ωτ − ω0) coth (β/2 ω0) .

(21)
The quantity Q∗ is a measure of adiabaticty [21, 51], which
fully encodes the dynamics. In particular, we have Q∗ = 1
for adiabatic, inﬁnitely slow processes, and Q∗ > 1 for
ﬁnite time driving. The change in equilibrum free energy
becomes [31]

parametrizations even tight.

Concluding remarks A conceptually consistent and
complete framework of quantum thermodynamics cru-
cially depends on accounting for quantum features and pe-
culiarities [52]. In the present analysis we have shown that
despite its success the two-time energy measurement ap-

�������������������*�������<�>�������������������*-���������<�>proach to quantum work neglects the informational back-
action of the projective measurements. This informational
contribution to the laws of quantum thermodynamics has
been highlighted by introducing a new paradigm, in which
quantum work is fully determined by the change of inter-
nal energy as an average over the initial energy eigenstates.
This approach has allowed us to derive a modiﬁed quantum
Jarzynski equality and a modiﬁed maximum work theorem,
in which the equilibrium free energy is replaced by the
information free energy. In conclusion, we achieved sev-
eral important insights: (i) we have proposed a thermody-
namically consistent notion of quantum work, which does
not rely on external observers and projective measurements
and (ii) we have included the thermodynamic cost of infor-
mation gain in the paradigm of quantum work, and hence
taken an instrumental step towards a conclusive theory of
quantum thermodynamics of quantum information.

[23] A unital map is a completely positive, trace preserving map
that also preserves the identity. Thermodynamically, a sys-
tem evolving under unital dynamics can be understood as an
open system that is so weakly coupled that it only exchanges
information, but no heat with the environment.
