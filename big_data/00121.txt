Abstract

We obtain lower bounds on the inverse compressibility of systems whose Lee-Yang zeros of the

grand-canonical partition function lie in the left half of the complex fugacity plane. This includes

in particular systems whose zeros lie on the negative real axis such as the monomer-dimer system

on a lattice. We also study the virial expansion of the pressure in powers of the density for such

systems. We ﬁnd no direct connection between the positivity of the virial coeﬃcients and the

negativity of the L-Y zeros, and provide examples of either one or both properties holding. An

explicit calculation of the partition function of the monomer-dimer system on 2 rows shows that

there are at most a ﬁnite number of negative virial coeﬃcients in this case.

INTRODUCTION

The zeros of the grand canonical partition function (GPF) Ξ(z, Λ), of equilibrium systems

in a region Λ at fugacity z, continue to be of interest [1] sixty years after their importance

for identifying phase transitions was described by Lee and Yang [2,3]. Thus, it was shown

recently that when the zeros of the GPF all lie in the left half of the complex z plane, the

system satisﬁes a local central limit theorem [4,5]. In this note we obtain some new results

for the thermodynamic properties of such systems, of which there are many examples in the

literature [6-14]. We also discuss the relation between the location of the zeros and the sign

of the virial coeﬃcients of such systems. Along the way, we obtain an exact expression for
the limiting behavior of the GPF for all systems with hard cores in the limit z → ∞, Λ
ﬁnite.

II. GENERAL PROPERTIES OF L-Y ZEROS

For systems with superstable [15] Hamiltonians, which includes all systems with hard
cores and interactions decaying fast enough, as well as ideal fermions, Ξ(z, Λ), Λ ⊂ Rd (or
Λ ⊂ Zd), can be written as a product over its roots [15]

Nm(cid:89)

Ξ(z, Λ) =

(1 + ηαz) ,

1 ≤ Nm ≤ ∞,

(1)

α=1

where Nm = Nm(Λ) is the maximum number of particles that can be contained in Λ. We
shall restrict ourselves here to systems with Nm(Λ) < ∞ and write Nm = ρm|Λ|, where |Λ| is
the volume of Λ (or the number of lattice sites), without explicitly indicating the dependence

of ρm on Λ. The roots of Ξ(z, Λ) are either negative or come in complex conjugate pairs and

depend on Λ, the inverse temperature β, and the interactions - dependencies which we will

not write out explicitly1.

1 The zeros will also depend for ﬁnite systems on the boundary conditions. This dependence disappears in

the thermodynamic limit as can be seen by taking limits in Eq. (4) as is done in Eq. (5).

The virial expansion is then obtained by eliminating z between Eq. (3) and Eq. (6) and

writing

p(ρ, Λ) ≡ p(z(ρ, Λ), Λ) =

∞(cid:88)

Bj(Λ)ρj.

(7)

The relation between the Bj(Λ) and bi(Λ), i ≤ j was derived in [18], but we will not make
use of that here. We also do not consider the direct derivation of the virial expansion from

j=1

the canonical partition function given in [19]. The latter diﬀers from Eq. (7) by terms which

3

vanish in the thermodynamic limit Λ → Rd(Zd). The rate of approach to equality between
the diﬀerent ensembles may depend on z (see below).

The |ηα|’s all lie in the range

|zm(Λ)|−1 ≤ |ηα(Λ)| ≤ |z0(Λ)|−1,

(8)

where z0(Λ) (zm(Λ)) are the zeros of Ξ(z, Λ) with the smallest (largest) absolute value.
Note that |z0(Λ)| = R(Λ), the radius of convergence of the fugacity series Eq. (3). There
is a simple lower bound to R(Λ) uniform in |Λ| [16, 20,21] (for positive potentials it is
2e|b2(Λ)|). Thus the |ηα(Λ)| remain bounded above when |Λ| → ∞, but can approach
R(Λ) ≥
zero in this limit. This fact and Eq. (4) ensures that there exists a limiting distribution for

the ηα’s in the thermodynamic limit, i.e. (cid:104)f (z)(cid:105) →(cid:82) f (z, η)ν(η)dη.

1

The radius of convergence R of the power series in z, obtained by interchanging the sum in
Eq. (3) and the limit Λ → Rd satisﬁes R ≥ limΛ→Rd R(Λ) [16] with equality when φ(r) ≥ 0.
There is also a lower bound for the radius of convergence R(Λ) of the virial expansion [22],
satisfying R(Λ) ≤ R, where R is the radius of convergence of the series Eq. (7) when Bj(Λ)
is replaced with Bj = limΛ→Rd Bj(Λ).

III. RESULTS FOR L-Y ZEROS IN THE NEGATIVE HALF PLANE

It follows from Eq. (4) that if the zeros all lie on the negative z-axis, the bj(Λ) alternate
in sign. This alternation of signs also holds if φ(r) ≥ 0 [23] although φ(r) ≥ 0 is not a
necessary condition for the zeros to be on the negative z-axis [8]. If φ(r) is negative over
any ﬁnite range, however, then there exists a β∗ suﬃciently large (i.e. a suﬃciently low
temperature) such that the alternation in sign does not hold. Therefore the L-Y zeros can
only stay on the negative real z-axis for all temperatures if φ(r) ≥ 0.

Let ηα = xα + i yα. Combining complex conjugate pairs in Eq. (6) leads to

which alternates in sign with k.

The inequality Eq. (16) becomes an equality for the ideal lattice gas, when the only

interaction is the hard core exclusion preventing the occupancy of any lattice site by more
than one particle. In that case ρm = 1, Ξ(z, Λ) = (1 + z)|Λ|, and all the L-Y zeroes are
located at z = −1, i.e. ηα = 1 for all α. Therefore V (z, Λ) = 0 and p(ρ, Λ) = − ln(1 − ρ).
While Eqs. (15-17) remain valid in the thermodynamic limit, where p(ρ) is the same for

all ensembles, including the grand canonical and canonical ensembles, the same is not true

of the limiting equality

(18)

Eq. (18) follows from the fact that for ﬁnite Nm(Λ), the |ηα|’s are bounded away from zero,
and is valid independent of the location of the L-Y zeros. Note, however, that Eq. (18)
may fail if the thermodyamic limit is taken before z → ∞ or when one uses the canonical
ensemble deﬁnition of the pressure. Such is the case for the lattice systems with extended

hard cores discussed in Sect. IV A.

(cid:40)

(cid:41)

Another (more interesting) way of writing Eq. (18), using Eq. (11), is

Nm(Λ) − N (z, Λ)

lim

N (z, Λ)

(19)

where both the numerator and the denominator vanish as z → ∞. Eq. (19) also can be
obtained by keeping only the terms proportional to zNm−1 and zNm in the GPF when z → ∞
at ﬁxed Λ.

IV. THE VIRIAL EXPANSION

The thermodynamic properties of a gas are determined at small densities by the virial

expansion (VE) of the pressure p(ρ, Λ) in powers of the density ρ given in Eq. (7). The

low order terms in the expansion can be readily computed for classical systems with pair

interactions φ(r) [17]. This can be done analytically or numerically in terms of the irreducible

Mayer cluster integrals [24]. In practice one only computes Bj = limΛ→Rd(Zd) Bj(Λ).

For the system of hard spheres (HS) in Rd, which is the paradigm model for representing
the eﬀective strong repulsion between atoms at short distances, the Bj are known in d = 3
for j ≤ 12 [25], with high accuracy for j ≤ 11 (Boltzmann had computed the ﬁrst four). In

6

d = 2, the Bj are known for j ≤ 10 [26]. In d = 1, p = ρ
m is the diameter
of the hard rods, so that Bj = aj−1, for all j. Remarkably, all known Bj for d = 1, 2, 3 are
positive, which has led to the speculation that in fact all Bj in d = 2, 3 are positive. It is

1−ρ a, where a = ρ−1

known, however, that this is false in d = 5, so that it is now generally expected that there

will be negative Bj in d = 3, but perhaps not in d = 2.

The physical interest in the positivity of the Bj lies in the fact that one would like

to extrapolate from the low density regime, well described by the ﬁrst few terms in the

virial expansion, to obtain information about p(ρ) = limΛ→Rd p(ρ, Λ) at higher densities,

including possibly about the ﬂuid-solid transition in d = 3. Based on numerical simulations

(Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics), one expects this transition to occur at a density of
ρf ≈ .492/v where v = π/6 a3 is the actual volume occupied by a sphere with diameter
a. The extrapolations of the pressure to higher densitites take many forms and are in very
good agreement with the machine results for ρ (cid:46) ρf [27,28]. Some even give very high
accuracy results for the metastable extension between ρf and the random close-packing
density ρr ≈ .64/v, a region which may also contain a transition from metastable ﬂuid to
glass [29–31].

In many of these (approximate) extrapolations, the radius of convergence R of the virial
expansion is determined by a singularity at some positive value of the density ˜ρ = R, with
˜ρ > ρf in d = 3 [27,28]. This will certainly hold when all Bj, or all but a ﬁnite number

of them, are positive, but need not be the case otherwise. In fact, for hard hexagons on a
triangular lattice R is determined by a singularity of p(ρ) at ρ(cid:48), with ρ(cid:48) complex [32] and
smaller in modulus than the disorder-order transition ρd [33], |ρ(cid:48)| < ρd. If this were true
also for hard spheres in d ≥ 2 it would limit the utility of extrapolating the virial expansion
beyond the rariﬁed-gas phase.

Here we consider the relation between the signs of the Bj and the location of the Lee-

Yang zeros in the complex z plane. All the previously known examples of almost all positive

(i.e. a ﬁnite number of negative) Bj were for systems for which all the L-Y zeros lie on the

negative z-axis. This behavior ﬁts in with the conjecture by Federbush, et al., that all the

Bj for the monomer-dimer system on regular lattices are positive [34], since there the L-Y

zeros are indeed on the negative z-axis [12]. Systems with strictly negative L-Y zeros do

not have any phase transition, but this does not rule out the possibility that a system with
a phase transition has almost all Bj ≥ 0.

7

In fact, we do not ﬁnd a direct connection between the negativity of the L-Y zeros and

the possibility of almost all positive virial coeﬃcients, and indeed we ﬁnd models that have

only the former property, only the latter, or both. This negative result leaves open the
positivity of almost all positive virial coeﬃcients for hard spheres in d = 2 or d = 3 (R
could even be larger than the close packing density). There does seem, however, to be some

connection between the proximity of L-Y zeros to the negative axis and the positivity of

virial coeﬃcients (see examples below) for which we have no complete explanation at the
present time. For example, in terms of the moments mj = (cid:104)ηj(cid:105) introduced in Eq. (4), the
ﬁrst few Bj are

B1 = 1 = ρm m1,

B2 =

2
B3 = ρ2

2 − 2

ρm m3.

(20)

It follows that B2 > 0 iﬀ (cid:104)x2(cid:105) > (cid:104)y2(cid:105), where the xα and yα are deﬁned in Sect. III.

A. Hard core lattice gases in 1D

(i) Consider a 1D lattice of N sites separated by unit distance (the lattice length is

L = N ) with the pair potential u(xij), (xij = |i − j|)

u(xij) = 0 if xij ≥ q,
u(xij) = ∞ if xij < q.

(21)

The integer q, q ≥ 1, is called the “exclusion factor” (q = 1 is the ideal lattice gas and q = 2
is isomorphic to the 1D monomer-dimer problem). Using the canonical ensemble, it was
shown in Ref. [3] that for L → ∞

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

p(ρ) = ln

1 +

ρ

1 − ρ/ρm

= − ln(1 − ρ/ρm) + ln(1 − ρ/ρm + ρ),

dρ = 1/ρm (cid:54)= 1 for q > 1, which gives an
where ρm = 1/q. Note that limρ→ρm(1 − ρ/ρm) dp(ρ)
example of Eq. (18) failing when the thermodynamic limit is taken before letting z → ∞.
Expanding Eq. (22) we see that

1 − (1 − ρm)j

Bj =

(23)

ρj

8

which agrees with the ﬁnite-L grand canonical virial coeﬃcients from Eq. (7) only in the

thermodynamic limit. If we introduce the lattice constant δ and take the continuum limit
q δ → a as q → ∞, the problem reduces to that of hard rods of length a on a line with
pressure

p(ρ) =

ρ

1 − ρ/ρm

.

(24)

where ρm = 1/a. The L-Y zeros of the lattice model are on the negative real axis [9], as are

those of the continuum model [7]. Note however the change in the nature of the singularity
as ρ → ρm, with the divergence in the continuum case much stronger than in the lattice.

One can also derive the distribution of the L-Y zeros when L → ∞ for the q-exclusion

models. The equation of state, Eq. (22), gives z(p)

z(p) = (ep − 1)ep(q−1),

(25)

Upon using the Lagrange inversion formula to obtain the moments deﬁned in Eq. (4), mj =
(cid:104)ηj(cid:105), we ﬁnd

For q = 1, the m[1]

(cid:1). They ﬁnd that the m[t,r]

j = 1 are moments of a delta function δ(η − 1), which corresponds to the
ideal lattice gas. The authors of Ref. [35] consider a more general set of binomial sequences
m[t,r]
are moments of a probability density function ht,r(η)
with support on a domain Dt ⊆ [0, tt(t − 1)1−t]. Here we have t = q ∈ N, r = 0, and hq,0(η)
can be written in terms of the Meijer G-function [35]. This permits, for some q, to express

j

the limiting density of the ηα’s in terms of elementary functions. For example, for q = 2

h2,0(η) =

,

(27)

as also derived in [9]. The density h3,0(η) also has a simple expression in terms of elementary
functions for η ∈ [0, 27/4], which also diverges at the endpoints. These divergences imply
that the L-Y zeros of these two models reach inﬁnity in the thermodynamic limit and that

there is an accumulation of zeros near the smallest magnitude L-Y zero z0.

(ii) The next model we consider is a lattice consisting of two rows in which particles

exclude their nearest neighbor sites: two horizontal and one vertical. Using open boundary

The fugacity z, as a function of pressure p in the N → ∞ limit, is given by

z(p) = e2p tanh p.

(28)

(29)

There are in general several branches pj(z) that invert Eq. (29) at a given value of z. From

the results of Ref. [7], the pressure p(z) is the particular branch among the pj(z) with

largest real part. The L-Y zero distribution consists of analytic arcs that do not intersect

the positive z-axis and satisfy either: (a) for a given z0 there exist multiple branches pj(z0)
dp |p0 = 0
of largest real part or (b) the branch p(z) has an algebraic branch point, i.e. dz(p)
when p(z(p0)) = p0. By taking the modulus squared of Eq. (29) and equating real parts,
one ﬁnds that (a) implies z0 ∈ R. Checking (b), one ﬁnds that dz(p)
z± = −1/(±√

2 + 1)2. The L-Y zeros therefore lie on some part of the negative z-axis.

dp = 0 has solutions

To locate the singularities in the ρ plane, we get p(ρ) from Eq. (29)

where ρm = 1/2. The nearest singularities of p(ρ) occur at the square-root singularity
4(1 ± i). Thus there are an inﬁnite number of negative virial
in Eq. (30), i.e. at ρ± = 1

coeﬃcients. Though we limited our analysis to the 2-row case, Ref. [10] gives an in-depth

study of the L-Y zeros of the k-row case of this model with shifted cylindrical boundary

conditions. It is found that for k > 2, the L-Y zeros move oﬀ the negative real axis.

(iii) The 2-row monomer-dimer system is considered in Appendix A. We prove that it
has almost all Bj ≥ 0. This is not as strong as what Federbush, et al conjecture, but it goes
in that direction [34].

B. Square well interactions

In all examples so far, systems with positive virial coeﬃcients also have all L-Y zeros

on the negative z-axis. Next we give an example where almost all (possibly all) virial

10

coeﬃcients are positive, but the L-Y zeros are oﬀ axis. Consider the 1D lattice gas with

a nearest neighbor pair potential ε. This system is isomorphic to the 1D Ising model with

nearest neighbor interactions. The equation of state in the thermodynamic limit is [13]

p(ρ) = − ln[1 − ρ] + ln

(cid:34)

1 − 1 − 2αρ −(cid:112)1 − 4α(1 − ρ)ρ

(cid:35)

2(1 − α)

(31)

α = 1 − e−ε.

For α ≥ 0, the system is ferromagnetic and the L-Y zeros lie on a circle in the complex plane
by the well-known L-Y circle theorem [3]. When α < 0 the system is antiferromagnetic and

the L-Y zeros are on the negative real axis with a known distribution [13].

The virial coeﬃcients Bj, however, are almost all positive over a range of both positive

and negative potentials. The power series of the ﬁrst logarithm in Eq. (31) has all positive
coeﬃcients and a radius of convergence of R1 = ρm = 1.
If the series expansion of the
second logarithm in Eq. (31) has a radius of convergence R2 > R1, then it follows that its
coeﬃcients will eventually be smaller in magnitude than those of the ﬁrst logarithm, and

only a ﬁnite number of virial coeﬃcients can be negative.

All singularities in the second logarithm occur when the square root in Eq. (31) vanishes.

One ﬁnds

Note that for all α < 1, R2 occurs at a complex value of ρ. For |α| (cid:28) 1, R2 > R1
and the virial coeﬃcients are almost all positive. As we increase the magnitude of α, R2
decreases until it falls below R1, at which point there are an inﬁnite number of negative
virial coeﬃcients. Only when α = 1, the hard core limit, does R2 occur at a positive value
of ρ. Deﬁning α∗ by R2(α∗) = R1, we ﬁnd

Appendix A: Virial coeﬃcients for the 2-row monomer-dimer problem

Heilmann and Lieb [12] proved that monomer-dimer (MD) systems have all L-Y zeros

on the negative real axis of the dimer fugacity z. It is conjectured in [34] that the virial

coeﬃcients are always positive for MD systems on regular lattices. We prove here that this

is indeed the case for the 2-row inﬁnite square lattice (more precisely, we prove that only a

ﬁnite number of coeﬃcients can be negative).

We use a standard transfer matrix formalism to obtain the grand partition function on
a 2 × N lattice with open boundary conditions. The system can have one of ﬁve right-end
states, as shown in Fig. 1. Let vN be the vector whose j-th component is the GPF for
conﬁgurations on a 2× N lattice restricted to having the j-th right-end state listed in Fig. 1.
The total GPF ΞN (z) is then

ΞN (z) = u · vT

and the transfer matrix M is

For z > 0, one can verify that M 2 has strictly positive entries, which implies by the Perron-

Frobenious theorem that there is a unique, real, largest modulus eigenvalue of M for z > 0.

The characteristic polynomial P (z, λ) of M satisﬁes the equation

which implies that λm(z) is the largest solution of

T ≈ (−.394, .784).

Let t1,2 be the two real roots of the polynomial P4(t), where t1 ≈ −.394 and t2 ≈ .784. On
T = (t1, t2), ρ(t) is a strictly increasing function, with ρ(t) → −∞ as t → t1 and ρ(t) → ∞
as t → t2, so that we may deﬁne τ (ρ) to be the particular inverse function of ρ(t) which
takes values in T. τ (ρ) is then a bijection from R to T (see Fig. 2), with τ (ρ(t)) = t for
t ∈ T. This deﬁnition of τ (ρ) allows us to deﬁne p(ρ) on ρ ∈ (−∞, ρm)

(A8)

We now analytically continue p(ρ) from the domain ρ ∈ (−∞, ρm) into the complex plane in
order to determine the location of its ﬁnite-ρ singularities. In particular, the ﬁrst logarithm
in Eq. (A8) is singular only at ρm or |ρ| → ∞. This term has all positive expansion
coeﬃcients about ρ = 0 and a radius of convergence of R1 = ρm. We will show that f (ρ) is
analytic inside a disk of radius R2 > R1. This implies that asymptotically the coeﬃcients
in the expansion of f (ρ) are smaller in magnitude than those coming from the ﬁrst term,

and therefore there are at most a ﬁnite number of negative virial coeﬃcients.

The singularities of the second logarithm in Eq. (A8) occur either where τ (ρ) is singular

or where f (ρ) diverges. To discuss both of these possibilities it is convenient to deﬁne a

14

-0.4-0.20.20.40.60.8τ(ρ)-4-3-2-1123ρsingle-valued “physical” branch of τ (ρ) in an appropriately cut complex ρ plane. We begin

(cid:12)(cid:12)t∗= 0; using Mathematica

with τ (ρ) deﬁned on the entire real axis (see Fig. 2) and real analytic there. All possible sin-
gularities (branch points) t∗ of τ (ρ) may be found by solving dρ(t)
to get numerical values, we ﬁnd six solutions of this equation, with corresponding branch
points in the ρ plane given by 0.313 ± 0.536 i, 0.497 ± 0.121 i, 0.438, and 1.039. We now
introduce four cuts in the ρ plane, one beginning at each of the complex branch points and
extending radially to ∞. The physical branch of τ (ρ) is deﬁned in this plane by analytic
continuation from the real axis, and is single valued. Note that we do not need to consider

dt

the two real branch points since this physical branch is known to be analytic on the real

axis; these branch points lie on other sheets of τ (ρ).

The singularities we must consider in determining R2, the radius of convergence of the
power series for f (ρ) in powers of ρ, are thus the four complex branch points deﬁned above
and the points where f (ρ) diverges. For the latter, we note that f (ρ) diverges if τ (ρ) = −1.
Using Eq. (A7), however, we see that τ (ρ) = −1 implies that ρ = ρm, and we know that on
the physical branch, τ (ρm) = φ−1 (cid:54)= −1; thus this singularity cannot occur on the physical
branch. The only other way that f (ρ) diverges is if P4(τ (ρ)) = 0. Here we again use Eq. (A7)
and we see that |ρ(t)| = ∞ if P4(t) = 0; these singularities occur at ∞ in the ρ plane and
cannot aﬀect the value of R2.

Since each of the complex branch points of τ (ρ) has absolute value greater than ρm, we
conclude that R2 > R1. It follows that for j → ∞, the Bj are dominated by those obtained
from the ﬁrst logarithm in Eq. (A8). Hence, there are at most a ﬁnite number of negative

virial coeﬃcients in the virial expansion.

The solution of the ﬁnite periodic 2-row lattice (not detailed here) yields the ﬁrst N − 1
inﬁnite lattice virial coeﬃcients exactly (see [36] for example). Numerically we checked the

ﬁrst 200 virial coeﬃcients are positive, and we believe that the proven ﬁnite number of

negative coeﬃcients is indeed zero.
