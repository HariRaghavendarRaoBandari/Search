Abstract

In this work, oriented for students with knowledge of basics of linear
algebra, we demonstrate, how the use of polar decomposition allows one
to understand metric properties of non-degenerate linear operators in R2.

Introduction

Let R2 be the standard two-dimensional Euclidean space and ϕ be a reversible,

non-isometric linear operator on this space. Let A =(cid:18)a b
ϕ in the standard basis i =(cid:18)1
0(cid:19), j =(cid:18)0
ϕ is reversible, so det(A) = ad − bc 6= 0.

Let P (λ) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

1(cid:19) of R2. We will assume that operator

The roots λ1, λ2 of polynomial P could be either real numbers (real spectrum),
or complex conjugate (complex spectrum).
In the case of real spectrum we
will assume that λ2 > λ1 > 0. In the real case there are two one-dimensional
invariant subspaces L1 and L2 in R2, which consist of the eigenvectors with
eigenvalues λ1 and λ2, respectively. In the complex case there are no non-trivial
invariant subspaces.

In this paper we will determine the range of angles between the vectors x and
ϕ(x), using the polar decomposition of given operator ϕ. In § 1 we will recall
the notion of polar decomposition and its properties. In § 2 we will consider an
operator with a real spectrum and will estimate the angle γ between the vectors
x and ϕ(x).

In § 5 we compute the norm of an operator ϕ and in § 6 we study trajectories
of the points under the action of an operator with the complex spectrum such
that det(A) = 1. We prove that each trajectory belongs to some ellipse.

Other applications of polar decomposition can be seen in [4].

§ 1. The polar decomposition of the reversible

linear operator on the plane

Let us note at ﬁrst that if ϕ is an operator in R2 with complex spectrum, then

det(A) > 0, where A =(cid:18)a b
d(cid:19) is the matrix of ϕ in the standard base. Indeed,
in this case the discriminant (a+d)2−4(ad−bc) of the characteristic polynomial
of matrix A is negative.
In the real case we will assume that eigenvalues λ1 and λ2 of ϕ are positive.

c

Here det(A) is also positive.

Now let us consider a self-conjugate operator ϕ ◦ ϕ∗ (ϕϕ∗(x) = ϕ∗(cid:0)ϕ(x)(cid:1))
and its (symmetric) matrix AtA. It is well known that eigenvalues λ and µ of
operator ϕ ◦ ϕ∗ are positive and the corresponding eigenvectors e1 and e2 —
orthonormal. There exists operator ϕ′ such that ϕ◦ ϕ∗ = (ϕ′)2. ϕ′ is a positive

operator with the matrix B in the standard base and the matrix

B ′ =(cid:18)√λ

0 √µ(cid:19)

(4)

in base e1 and e2. It must be noted that B is a symmetric matrix, because ϕ′
is a self-adjoint operator, and B 2 = AtA.

The product A = (AB−1)B = OB is called a polar decomposition of matrix

A. Here the matrix O = AB−1 is orthogonal. Indeed,

OtO = (AB−1)tAB−1 = B−1AtAB−1 = B−1B 2B−1 = E.

Orthogonal matrix O deﬁnes an operator ψ, which is either a rotation,
det(O) > 0, or reﬂection, if det(O) < 0.
operator, then O deﬁnes a rotation on angle α, thus

if
If det(A) > 0 and ϕ′ is a positive

O =(cid:18)cos α − sin α
cos α (cid:19) .

sin α

If ϕ is an operator with complex spectrum, then, as we know, det(A) > 0. So,
in this case also the orthogonal operator ψ in polar decomposition is a rotation.
Let A′ be the matrix of operator ϕ in the base e1 and e2. As A′ = OB ′,

then

A′ =(cid:18)cos α − sin α

§ 2. Angles of rotations of the operator with the

real spectrum

Let λ1 and λ2, 0 < λ1 < λ2, be eigenvalues of ϕ and u1 and u2, |u1| = |u2| = 1,
be the corresponding eigenvectors. Let β be the acute angle between u1 and
u2. The plane is divided in four parts (cones) by two lines corresponding to
the subspaces L1 = hu1i and L2 = hu2i. Each open cone is invariant under the

3

action of ϕ and under this action each vector x moves in the direction to the
line L2. Let us compute the maximal value γmax of the angle γ between the
vectors x and ϕ(x) and estimate the angle γ.

Theorem 1. Let ϕ be the operator with the real spectrum , λ1, λ2 are
positive eigenvalues of the operator ϕ and β is the acute angle between the

eigenvectors, then 0 6 γ 6 arccos

2√λ1λ2 − (λ1 + λ2) cos β

Proof. We shall work in the base {u1, u2}. Let x1 and x2 be the coordinates
(x, ϕ(x))
of vector x in our base, then ϕ(x) = λ1x1u1 + λ2x2u2. As cos γ =
|x||ϕ(x)|

be its matrix in the base e1, e2 (see § 1).
Here α is the rotation angle of the orthogonal operator ψ and λ and µ are
eigenvalues of positive operator ϕ ◦ ϕ∗ = (ϕ′)2. As ϕ has no eigenvectors then
it rotates each vector x 6= 0 in one direction on some angle γ = γ(x) 6= 0. If
γ ′(x) is the angle between vectors x and ϕ′(x), then γ(x) = α + γ ′(x). It must
be noted that angles γ ′ may be positive and negative i. e. rotation from x to
ϕ′(x) may be counterclockwise or clockwise.

Remark. For an operator ϕ with the real positive spectrum, its polar de-
composition also can be used to calculate the angles γmin and γmax, but the
condition (6) shows us that |γmax| > |α|, hence γmin and γmax have diﬀerent
signs. It means that ϕ rotates vectors in diﬀerent directions, while the opera-
tor ϕ with the complex spectrum rotates all vectors in one direction — in the
direction of the angle α.

In order to simplify the integration we apply the polar coordinates x =

In order to get the sensible result for ¯γ we have to limit the value of the
angles α — the angles of rotation of the operators ψ. Let α ∈ [0, π] then α can
be uniquely determined by cos α. As similar matrices have the same trace, then
cos α(√λ +√µ) = a + d or, after the change of variables, cos α =

As sin α > 0 for α ∈ [0, π] then sin α =

consider only part of the domain G corresponding to z > 0. As α = α(x, y, z, t)
is the homogeneous function, we can use the domain G′ with the condition

but also changes its length. If x = x1e1 + x2e2 then ϕ′(x) = √λ x1e1 +√µ x2e2.
As an orthogonal operator ψ does not change the length of the vectors, then
(λ − µ)(x1)2
|ϕ(x)| = |ϕ′(x)|. So
(x1)2 + (x2)2 . It is
easy to estimate all possible values of this ratio and to calculate the norm of an

Let ϕ be an operator with the complex spectrum, such that det(A) = 1. Thus
its eigenvalues are complex conjugate numbers exp(iθ), exp(−iθ) of modul 1.

Let Φ be the complexiﬁcation of ϕ and z =(cid:18)z1
z2(cid:19) = A ·(cid:18)u1

As Φ(z) = exp(iθ) · z = (cos θ + i sin θ) · (u + iv) = (cos θ · u − sin θ · v) +
i(sin θ · u + cos θ · v), then

v2(cid:19) = ϕ(u) + iϕ(v), where u ∈ R2, v ∈ R2.

(19)

(20)

Now consider conjugate complex vector ¯z = u − iv. Φ(¯z) = A · ¯z = A · z =
exp(iθ) · ¯z = exp(−iθ) · ¯z, hence ¯z is the eigenvector of Φ corresponding to the
eigenvalue exp(−iθ). The vectors z and ¯z are linearly independent hence the
are linearly independent too and can be taken
vectors u =

the operator ϕ in the base u, v is

This matrix describes a rotation of the plane on an angle θ if and only if the

not true in general.

Let us look at two co-ordinate systems on the plane. One of them has the
x-axis and the y-axis corresponding the base i, j and another co-ordinate system
has the x′-axis and the y ′-axis corresponding the base u, v. Let x′ and y ′ are
coordinates of vector x in the base u, v, then according to (21), coordinates of
vector ϕ(x) in this base, cos θ · x′ − sin θ · y ′ and sin θ · x′ + cos θ · y ′, satisfy the
condition (cos θ · x′ − sin θ · y ′)2 + (sin θ · x′ + cos θ · y ′)2 = (x′)2 + (y ′)2.
