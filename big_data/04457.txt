Manipulating materials properties far from equilibrium recently garnered

signiﬁcant attention, with experimental emphasis on transient melting, en-

hancement, or induction of electronic order [1, 2, 3, 4]. A more tantalizing

aspect of the matter-light interaction regards the possibility to access dy-

namical steady states with distinct non-equilibrium phase transitions to aﬀect

electronic transport [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Here, we show that the interplay of crystal

symmetry and optical pumping of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides

(TMDCs) provides a novel avenue to engineer topologically-protected chiral

edge modes. In stark contrast to graphene [10, 11] and previously-discussed

toy models [8, 13, 14], the underlying generic mechanism relies on the intrin-

sic three-band nature of TMDCs near the band edges. Photo-induced band

inversions scale linearly in applied pump ﬁeld and exhibit a transition from

one to two chiral edge modes upon sweeping from red to blue detuning. We

develop a strategy to understand non-equilibrium Floquet-Bloch bands and

topological transitions directly from ab initio calculations, and illustrate for

1

the example of WS2 that control of chiral edge modes can be dictated solely

from symmetry principles and is not qualitatively sensitive to microscopic

materials details.

Viewed na¨ıvely as semiconducting analogs of graphene, trigonal-prismatic monolayers

of MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2 possess sizeable intrinsic band gaps due to broken inver-

sion symmetry [13], that can be expected to sustain intense sub-gap pump pulses while

limiting absorption. Prior theoretical studies established that the band edges at K and
K(cid:48) are dominated by transition-metal d-orbitals, which split into three groups with irre-
ducible representations (IRs) A(cid:48){d3z2−r2}, E(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48){dx2−y2 ± id2xy} and E(cid:48)(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48)(cid:48){dxz ± idyz}
of the C3h point group [15, 16]. Generalizing graphene, these valleys are well-captured

in equilibrium by a degenerate Kramers’ pair of massive Dirac fermions, giving rise to

valley-Hall [13] and spin-Hall [17, 18] eﬀects.

Out of equilibrium, dynamical breaking of time-reversal symmetry was demonstrated

to lift the valley degeneracy for WS2 and WSe2 via oﬀ-resonant optical pumping with

circularly-polarized light [8, 9]. In this case, the selection rules for a massive Dirac fermion
entail that the handedness of pump polarization selectively addresses either the K or K(cid:48)

valley, imparting an AC Stark shift on only one of the valleys. Analogously, the photo-

excitation can selectively populate valleys, enabling spin and valley valley currents using

circular or linear polarization [19, 20, 21].

Conceptually simple, irradiation with a suﬃciently broad pump pulse dresses the origi-

nal electronic bands by multiples of the photon frequency, with electric dipole coupling re-

sulting in an eﬀective steady-state band structure; Floquet-Bloch theory then corresponds

precisely to the classical limit of strong pump ﬁelds that are indistinguishable before and

after photon absorption or emission. One paradigmatic model of such “Floquet-Bloch

bands” is graphene [10, 11, 12], where circularly-polarized light can break time-reversal

2

symmetry to dynamically lift the Dirac point degeneracies. While Floquet-Bloch states

were indeed observed recently via micro-wave pumping Dirac cones on the surface of topo-

logical insulators [6, 7], an extension to proper topological phase transitions is still well

beyond experimental reach due to the tremendous required intensity A to open a sizeable
gap ∆ ∼ A2/Ω [10] for above-bandwidth pump frequencies.

Even more tantalizingly, it was predicted that eﬀective TMDC toy models of “graphene

with a gap” admit in theory an optically-induced quantum Hall eﬀect with a single chiral
mode localized at the sample edge. A high-frequency pump Ω → ∞ well above the

bandwidth can in principle close and invert the equilibrium band gap at a single valley

[14], however requiring tremendous pump intensities as the relative gap shift scales as
∼ evDA2/Ω3 with vD the Dirac velocity. Alternatively, it was proposed that a resonant

pump beam can hybridize the massive Dirac fermion valence and conduction bands and

thereby generate a single chiral edge mode [8] at lower pump strength. However, we show

instead that such a simple description of TMDCs fails to hold for optical pumping; here,

the added complexity of a microscopic materials description opens up a novel avenue to

photo-induce chiral edge modes in a realistic experimental setting.

Central to this paper, dipole transitions to higher-lying bands as determined directly

from ab initio calculations and underlying symmetry considerations are crucial for a de-

scription of photo-induced topological band inversions in TMDCs. To understand the

breakdown of “graphene with a gap”, consider a monolayer ribbon irradiated by circularly-

polarized light, for collinear sample and polarization planes [Fig. 1(a)]. In graphene, the
low-energy E(cid:48)(cid:48) bands are separated from A(cid:48)(cid:48) bands by more than 10eV at K, K(cid:48) [22], hence

optical frequencies can be treated safely within the canonical low-energy Dirac model of

π orbitals. In contrast, the band structures of prototypical TMDC monolayers [Fig. 1(b)]
possess a E(cid:48) band only ∼ 2eV above the conduction band (CB) [Fig. 1(b)], and E(cid:48)(cid:48)

3

bands in the same vicinity [23, 24, 25, 26]. Circularly-polarized light at close-to-bandgap
pump frequencies therefore couples the A(cid:48) CB to both the E(cid:48) valence band (CB) and the
¯E(cid:48) higher-energy conduction band (XB), while leaving the E(cid:48)(cid:48) bands decoupled in the

absence of multipole transitions.

Consider ﬁrst slightly red-detuned pumping below the band edge [Fig. 2(a)]. Here,

a ring of states from the higher-energy XB is brought into resonance with the CB, while

simultaneously limiting absorption and heating by avoiding resonant coupling between the

VB and CB. At the band edge, C3h dipole selection rules [Fig. 2(e)] dictate that absorption
of a photon couples transitions A(cid:48) → ¯E(cid:48) → E(cid:48) → A(cid:48). At K(cid:48), the bare CB |m = 0; A(cid:48), CB(cid:105)
couples to the XB dressed by a single emitted photon |m = −1; E(cid:48), XB(cid:105) as well as the

VB dressed by a single absorbed photon (cid:12)(cid:12)m = +1; ¯E(cid:48), V B(cid:11). Both transitions, though

oﬀ-resonant, are energetically favorable, leading to a signiﬁcant Stark shift at K(cid:48) [Fig.

2(b)]. Conversely, at K the IRs of VB and XB are reversed. Here, the conduction band
couples to the VB dressed by a single emitted photon |m = −1; E(cid:48), V B(cid:105) as well as the XB

dressed by a single absorbed photon(cid:12)(cid:12)m = +1; ¯E(cid:48), XB(cid:11). Both transitions are energetically

unfavorable, leading to a negligible shift of the band edge. Slightly away from K and K(cid:48),

electric dipole coupling lifts the ring of degeneracy between the CB and XB and opens

a photo-induced hybridization gap at both valleys [Fig. 2(b)], which scales linearly with

weak pump ﬁelds. Crucially, the resulting Floquet-Bloch bands exhibit a topological

‘band inversion’ with the orbital character ﬂipped close to the valley minimum at both

valleys [Fig. 2(b)].

To discern whether the band inversions can be non-trivial, we devise eﬀective Floquet

“low-energy” models of the hybridization gaps. We start from the generic description

ˆH0 = ˆp2/2m0 + V (r) of a semiconductor in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and ex-

citonic eﬀects, where V (r) is the crystal potential. In equilibrium, starting from an ab

4

initio Bloch eigenbasis at a single high-symmetry point, the dispersion and orbital con-

tent follow from canonical k.p theory by perturbing in momentum deviation k under
replacement ˆp → ˆp + k [27]. In the presence of a time-periodic ﬁeld A(t), a straight-

forward generalization uses a Floquet eigenbasis of the generic non-equilibrium problem

ˆH0(t) = 1
2m0

[ˆp + eA(t)]2 + V (r). This basis can be obtained from density-functional

theory calculations via knowledge of the equilibrium band energies and dipole transition

matrix elements. Note that this Floquet k.p theory is non-perturbative in the applied

pump ﬁeld and naturally accounts for multi-photon coupling to higher-energy CBs, XBs

and deeper VBs, as well as local inter-orbital dipole transitions. An eﬀective low-energy

description of the photo-induced gaps can now be devised in Floquet basis in analogy to
the equilibrium problem, by considering a perturbation in crystal momentum ˆp → ˆp +k

and downfolding onto eﬀective two-band Floquet models using canonical L¨owdin pertur-

bation theory.

Central to the robustness of this proposal, the form of these eﬀective models is de-

termined solely from symmetry and is universal to trigonal-prismatic TMDC monolay-
ers. To see this, ﬁrst consider K: Here, the Floquet eigenbasis [Fig. 2(b)] |Ψ1(cid:105) (|Ψ2(cid:105))

admixes |m = 0; A(cid:48), CB(cid:105) with |m = −1; E(cid:48), V B(cid:105), (cid:12)(cid:12)m = +1; ¯E(cid:48), XB(cid:11) ((cid:12)(cid:12)m = −1; ¯E(cid:48), XB(cid:11)

with |m = −2; A(cid:48), CB(cid:105), |m = 0; E(cid:48), V B(cid:105)), linear in ﬁeld A0. Constrained by crystal sym-

metry, we ﬁnd that the eﬀective Floquet physics at K is generically determined by a p-d

Dirac model [Supplementary Material]:

ˆHK(k) = 0(k) +

vpk− − vdk2
2 + B|k|2

+

(cid:20) M
2 − B|k|2
vpk+ − vdk2− − M

(cid:21)

(1)

Here, vp, vd are linear functions in ﬁeld strength, and an additional purely dispersive term
0(k) = ∆0 + ∆2|k|2 breaks particle-hole symmetry. While the parameters depend on the

details of the Bloch states near the Dirac points, overall topological considerations can be

5

gleaned simply from Eq. 1. In the absence of vd, Eq. (1) describes a conventional massive

Dirac fermion, with M (B) the Dirac (inverse band) mass, and vp the Dirac velocity.

The orbital character exhibits a p-wave winding around K and mirrors the quantum

anomalous Hall eﬀect in HgyMn1−yTe quantum wells [29]. Switching on vd imparts a

trigonal distortion by reducing the continuous rotational symmetry around K to C3, and

introduces instead a ‘d-wave’ winding in the limit of(cid:112)B/M vd (cid:29) vp.

At K(cid:48) interchanged IRs E(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48) entail a strongly-admixed Floquet eigenbasis as well
as a signiﬁcant Stark shift. However selection rules forbid a coupling between |Ψ1(cid:105) ,|Ψ2(cid:105)
linear in k – instead, one ﬁnds that the two bands couple to quadratic order in ∼ A0k+k−,
via intermediate states m = 0; E(cid:48) XB or m = −1; A(cid:48) CB. The eﬀective Hamiltonian for
K(cid:48) in this case generically reads

(cid:20) M(cid:48)
2 − B(cid:48)|k|2
v(cid:48)|k|2

(cid:21)

v(cid:48)|k|2
2 + B(cid:48)|k|2

− M(cid:48)

ˆHK(cid:48)(k) = (cid:48)

0(k) +

(2)

with v(cid:48) a rotationally-symmetric band mixing term.

At K (K(cid:48)), the band ordering is inverted when M/B > 0 (M(cid:48)/B(cid:48) > 0).

If the

orbital character of Floquet-Bloch bands in the remaining Brillouin zone is suﬃciently

ˆd(k)× ∂ky

benign, we can draw conclusions on the global topology by understanding separately
the band inversions at K and K(cid:48). Rewriting Eqs. (1), (2) in terms of Pauli matrices
ˆd(k) ·
ˆH = 0(k) + σ · d(k), the local Berry curvature follows from the winding F(k) = 1
ˆd(k)) with ˆd(k) = d(k)/|d(k)|. One can see by inspection that the absence
(∂kx
of ˆσy in Eq. (2) enforces F(k) = 0 ; therefore, the photo-induced band inversion around
K(cid:48) is necessarily trivial. Conversely, the band inversion at K is topological and triggers a
change in the Chern number C, which can be evaluated via appropriate compactiﬁcation
of k-space R2 to a non-contractible manifold [Supplementary Material].

2

Consider ﬁrst the limit of a massive Dirac model with vd = 0. In this case, the Chern

6

number changes from C = 0 for B/M < 0 to C = ±1 for B/M > 0, inducing a single

chiral edge mode at the sample boundary that spans the photo-induced hybridization gap.

Then, switching on vd introduces a trigonal distortion of the Floquet-Bloch bands around

K up to a critical strength v2

d = B/M v2

p, at which the Floquet-Bloch bands close the gap

at three points away from K, related by C3. Correspondingly, this topological transition
changes C by 3, to C = ∓2, entailing not one but two chiral edge modes at the sample

boundary.

While the relevant Floquet basis is predominantly built from only the m = 0 CB
and m = −1 XB for a red-detuned pump, the p-wave coupling vp between the two

is necessarily mediated via the VB, highlighting the necessity of a minimal three-band

description. The d-wave term vd instead results from direct coupling between CB and

XB.Strong optical absorption in TMDC monolayers indicates a large dipole transition

matrix element between VB and CB, suggesting that a red-detuned pump will generically

reach only the C = 1 phase.

Conversely, consider the opposite regime of a suﬃciently blue-detuned pump [Fig.
2(c)]. Here, a ring of VB states is brought into resonance with the CB near K, K(cid:48) while

pushing the photon-dressed XB into the equilibrium band gap. Electric dipole coupling

again opens photo-induced hybridization gaps, both at the bottom of the CB and top of

the VB [Fig. 2(d)], and the symmetry analysis mirrors the discussion of the red-detuned
case above, leading to equivalent eﬀective Hamiltonians at K, K(cid:48) (1), (2). However, linear

in k coupling between the m = 0 CB and the m = +1 VB is now necessarily mediated
via the XB (or other ¯E(cid:48) bands separated further in energy), whereas the d-wave term vd

follows directly from dipole coupling between VB and CB and thus dominates over vp.

One can thus generically expect a frequency-tunable Floquet Chern insulator in monolayer

TMDCs, upon tuning the pump from red to blue detuning.

7

To illustrate the above predictions, we now consider WS2 as a prototypical TMDC

monolayer. First, we perform ab initio DFT calculations to derive an eﬀective minimal
tight-binding model of three A(cid:48), E(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48) Wannier orbitals localized on the transition metal

[Fig. 1(b,c)]. The resulting Floquet spectrum on a ribbon is depicted in Fig. 3.

In

equilibrium [Fig. 3(a)], WS2 already hosts a pair of trivial edge states in analogy to
zigzag edges of graphene, with right (left) propagating modes at the K (K(cid:48)) point that

span the band gap. A weak, red-detuned pump ﬁeld opens a hybridization gap at the

bottom of the CB, spanned by a single chiral mode at K [Fig. 3(b)], localized at the

sample edge. The photo-induced gap scales linearly with weak A, but closes and reopens

at a critical pump strength, transitioning again to a trivial phase without chiral modes.

Conversely, for a blue-detuned pump [Fig. 3(c)] a second chiral edge mode appears,

spanning the hybridization gaps both at the bottom of the CB and the top of the VB.

The appearances of edge modes in ribbon spectra are in excellent agreement with eﬀec-

tive model parameters [Eqs. (1), (2)] derived from the Wannier tight-binding description.
Fig. 4(c) depicts M/B and the ratio of p−/d−wave couplings that determine the Chern

number [Fig. 4(b)], in perfect correspondence with a rigorous calculation of the Floquet

Chern number [28] in the Wannier tight-binding model [Fig. 4(d), see supplement]. For

weak ﬁelds, deep within both the red- and blue-detuned regimes, the sign of the Dirac

M and band B mass are equal in the topologically-nontrivial phase. Increasing A closes

and reopens the Floquet gap at K, ﬂips the sign of M and uninverts the bands to reach a
trivial phase with C = 0. When C (cid:54)= 0, the Chern number follows from trigonal distortion

and changes from C = 1 for red detuning to C = 2 for blue detuning.

Having checked the validity of Floquet k.p theory in the tight-binding model, we now

turn to the full ab initio problem: To quantify the eﬀects of multi-photon resonances,

as well as local inter-orbital dipole transitions not captured in a tight-binding model, we

8

consider an ab initio 185-band description of band energies and dipole transition matrix
elements at K and K(cid:48) and calculate the model parameters of eqns.

(2), (1), taking

into account up to four-photon processes. The bands closest to the equilibrium gap are

depicted in Fig. 4(e). The resulting k.p classiﬁcation is depicted in Fig. 4(f). Crucially,

while the resonance lines distort due to eﬀects not accounted for in the tight-binding

model, the frequency-dependent switch from C = 1 to C = 2 as well as the reclosing of

the hybridization gap and transition back to a trivial regime for increasing pump strength

remains qualitatively the same. This suggests that the mechanism of photo-induced chiral

edge modes described in this work is largely robust at weak ﬁelds to the microscopic details

of the material.

The guiding theme of this work has been to build a bridge between the rapidly develop-

ing ﬁeld of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides and topological phase transitions

out of equilibrium, to provide a route towards achieving the latter in an experimentally-

attainable setting. We have shown that the three-band nature of the valleys in proto-

typical WS2 leads to a new mechanism to ‘switch’ on or oﬀ one or two chiral edges with

near band-gap optical irradiation. The resulting photo-induced gap in the single-particle

spectrum scales linearly with pump strength, suggesting substantial energy scales already

at low ﬁelds, while simultaneously ensuring minimal heating with suﬃcient detuning from

the band edge. Our theoretical analysis of the out-of-equilibrium valley band inversions

connects directly with equilibrium ab initio calculations, whereas the ensuing topology

of Floquet-Bloch bands relies purely on generic symmetry arguments, suggesting that

the predictions are robust to microscopic detail and should be observable in a range of

monolayer TMDC materials. Finally, our ﬁrst-principles and theoretical analysis provides

a promising strategy to predict and design topological states out of equilibrium in other

semiconductor materials.

Methods

ab initio Calculations ab initio calculations were performed in the framework of

the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) type generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of

density functional theory (DFT) using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave

method implemented in Wien2k [30]. We consider a single monolayer of WS2 with a

30rA vacuum space perpendicular to the layer along the z-direction. The in-plane lattice

constant and the S position have been relaxed by optimization of the total energy and total
force, respectively. For electronic structure calculations, we utilized a 15×15×1 k-space

grid. Momentum matrix element calculations were performed using the OPTIC package
implemented in Wien2k, with a 60×60×1 k-space grid. Maximally-localized Wannier

functions (MLWFs) for the ﬁve W 5d orbitals were obtained using wien2wannier [31] and

Wannier90 [32] with initial projections set to the spherical harmonics Y2m (m = -2, -1, 0,

1, 2). Due to the symmetry of the hexagonal lattice, the calculated Hamiltonian in the
new Wannier basis naturally decouples into the two standard subspaces { dx2−y2 ± i d2xy,
d3z2−r2 } and { dxz ± idyz }.

Floquet theory of the single-particle spectrum on a ribbon Floquet theory cap-

tures the eﬀective steady states that arise from a time-dependent (quasi-)periodic mod-

ulation. Consider a Hamiltonian ˆH(t) = ˆH(t + 2π

Ω ) with a periodic time dependence
with frequency Ω. Then, solutions of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for ˆH(t)

can be written as Φ(t) = eit(cid:80)

m umeimΩt, where  is the Floquet quasi-energy, and um

are Fourier coeﬃcients of the time-periodic part of the wave function. Substitution of

Φ(t) into Schr¨odinger’s equation recasts the time-dependent problem as an eﬀective time-

independent Floquet problem: the Floquet states can be found by ﬁnding eigenstates of

Floquet k.p Theory and Eﬀective Hamiltonians at K, K(cid:48) Here, we describe in
detail the derivation of the eﬀective Hamiltonians (1) and (2) at K and K(cid:48) that capture

the Floquet-Bloch band inversions for red and blue detunings. We take into account the

full ab initio problem including spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For brevity, and consistent
with the main text, we employ C3h single group IRs A(cid:48), E(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48), and ignore weak spin-
ﬂip terms such that the eﬀect of SOC enters as a Zeeman-like shift on spin ↑z,↓z bands.

However, as discussed in the supplementary information, the crystal double group dictates

that the discussion below remains the same under inclusion of spin-ﬂip scattering, and

15

the full SOC problem can be readily recovered merely by replacing the single-group by

the appropriate double IRs [Supplementary Information].

At K (and equivalently at K(cid:48)), a Floquet-Bloch eigenbasis follows from a solution of

where k± = kx ± iky. An eﬀective two-band Hamiltonian description of high-symmetry
points now follows from canonical L¨owdin partitioning of ˆH(cid:48) in the eigenbasis of ˆH0F , as

described in the main text.

Importantly, the inclusion of full spin-orbit coupling does not qualitatively alter these
conclusions. First, spin-ﬂip terms only weakly admix E(cid:48)(cid:48) bands of opposite spin [35,36];
however, the full crystal double group ¯C3h again decomposes into two spin-orbital manifold

with equivalent selection rules and eﬀective physics [Supplementary Material]. Second,

the valley Zeeman shift simply leads to a shift of the relevant resonance energies. Similarly,

while monolayer TMDCs have been shown to give rise to large excitonic binding energies

[33,34], in the context of our work their role is conﬁned to shifting the relevant resonance

energies, given appropriate tuning of the pump frequency.

Floquet two-band model and phase diagram of Fig. 2 in ab initio Floquet k.p theory. The
resulting phase diagram (f) remains qualitatively the same, suggesting that the photo-
induction of one or two chiral edge modes for appropriate tuning of the pump laser is
robust to multi-photon processes at weak pump ﬁelds.

Symmetry Analysis and the Role of Spin-Orbit Coupling

In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the relevant bands near K, K(cid:48) can be clas-

siﬁed according to the single-group irreducible representations (IRs) of the point group
C3h, denoted A(cid:48), E(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48), E(cid:48)(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48)(cid:48) [15, 16]. The corresponding character table and relevant

invariants are depicted in Tbl. 2. As discussed in the main text, reﬂection symmetry σh
guarantees that bands A(cid:48), E(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48) remain decoupled from E(cid:48)(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48) across the entire Brillouin

zone [13, 23, 24, 25, 26], and the analysis can therefore be constrained to three relevant
bands A(cid:48), E(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48) only. In 2H monolayer TMDCs, the conduction band transforms as A(cid:48)

and is dominantly composed of the transition metal d3z2−r2 orbital, whereas the valence
and relevant higher-energy band transform as E(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48) with a dominant contribution of
dx2−y2 ± id2xy orbitals. Furthermore, spin z is a good quantum number.

In equilibrium, the band structure can be expanded in k around K, K(cid:48) by starting

from Hamiltonian

Here, ˆσ are the Pauli matrices, and V (r) is the crystal potential.

The role of SOC can now be understood in two complementary ways, by either con-

sidering the eigenstates of ˆH0 as IRs of the C3h single group and treating SOC as a

23

perturbation, or by starting from the true Bloch eigenstates of ˆH0 + ˆHSOC at K, K(cid:48),
as IRs of the ¯C3h double group.
In the former case, the eigenstates of ˆH0 are spin-z
eigenstates with a given single-group IR, namely |A(cid:48)[d3z2−r2], σ(cid:105), |E(cid:48)[dx2−y2 + id2xy], σ(cid:105)

and(cid:12)(cid:12) ¯E(cid:48)[dx2−y2 − id2xy], σ(cid:11) with σ =↑z,↓z. To understand the eﬀect of SOC, it is useful

SOC transforms as A(cid:48) and acts as a mere Zeeman shift, whereas the spin-ﬂip con-
↑↓
SOC transforms as E(cid:48)(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48)(cid:48) and hence couples states with opposite parity under

σh. The latter entails a mixing between conduction band state |A(cid:48), σ(cid:105) and(cid:12)(cid:12)E(cid:48)(cid:48)( ¯E(cid:48)(cid:48)),−σ(cid:11)
as well as between the higher-energy conduction band(cid:12)(cid:12) ¯E(cid:48),↑(cid:11) and |E(cid:48)(cid:48),↓(cid:105) while leaving the
opposite spin(cid:12)(cid:12) ¯E(cid:48),↓(cid:11) unmixed. However, this mixing of ↑z,↓z states is suppressed as the

energy diﬀerence between the A(cid:48), E(cid:48) and E(cid:48)(cid:48) bands is larger than the spin-orbit coupling.
The SOC at K, K(cid:48) can therefore be well-captured as an eﬀective Zeeman shift [24, 26, 17]
while approximately leaving spin as a good quantum number [35, 36]. Away from K, K(cid:48),
k transforms as E(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48) and imparts an additional momentum-dependent Zeeman shift.

Consider now the double group, with its character table given in Tbl. 2. Spin-ﬂip
mixing with the E(cid:48)(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48)(cid:48) bands necessarily reduces the number of band IRs from 5 IRs ×2

spin orientations, to 6 double-group IRs. These again decompose into into two manifolds
denoted ⇑,⇓ that remain decoupled over the entire Brillouin zone. The identiﬁcation

24

of band states with single group and double group IRs is given in Tbl. 2(b). Note

that the states listed are not an eigenbasis of ˆH0 + ˆHSOC:

instead, the true eigenba-

sis will be a superposition of states of equal double-group IR, governed by the strength
of SOC. At K, K(cid:48), one can immediately deduce that the eigenbasis entails mixing of
|d3z2−r2, σ(cid:105) and |dxz+σ·iyz,−σ(cid:105), of |dx2−y2+2ixy + id2xy,↑(cid:105) and |dxz−iyz,↓(cid:105), and of|dxz+iyz,↑(cid:105)
and |dx2−y2 − id2ixy,↓(cid:105), while leaving states |dx2−y2 − id2xy,↑(cid:105) and |dx2−y2 + id2xy,↓(cid:105) un-
mixed and as proper eigenstates of ˆH0 + ˆHSOC.

Here, the k.p perturbation transforms as Γ2, Γ3 and couples the three ⇑ IRs Γ7, Γ10, Γ11
(⇓ IRs Γ8, Γ9, Γ12) in an equivalent manner as in the single-group case of A(cid:48), E(cid:48), ¯E(cid:48) without

spin-orbit coupling, or with SOC but without spin-ﬂip terms. Consequently, the selection

rules of electric dipole transitions for circular polarization are exactly equivalent, as shown

in Tbl. 2(c). For this reason, we chose to simply adopt the single-group notation and
label the spin manifolds as ↑z,↓z, while keeping in mind that SOC is indeed signiﬁcant for

certain TMDCs and enters through a one-to-one correspondence with the double group
IRs and spin manifolds ⇑,⇓.

Topological Classiﬁcation and Pseudospin Textures

The main text classiﬁes photo-induced topological phase transitions via local eﬀective
Floquet k.p Hamiltonians at K, K(cid:48). The key idea is to understand the global topology
via a local classiﬁcation of band inversions at K, K(cid:48), which relies on a-priori knowledge

that 1) the Floquet spectrum is gapped globally and 2) the Berry curvature behaves

benign at other high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. Armed with this knowledge, a

complementary view of local band inversions follows from considering so-called pseudospin
textures around K and K(cid:48). Starting from the local Floquet k.p Hamiltonians ˆHK(k) and
ˆHK(cid:48)(k) of equations 3 and 4 of the main text, we can recast these in terms of pseudospin

25

Pauli matrices σ:

ˆHν=K,K(cid:48)(k) = 0(k) + (k) ˆdν(k) · σ

(S9)

Here, 0(k) ± (k) is the dispersion of ˆHK(k) or ˆHK(cid:48)(k), and ˆdν(k) is the pseudospin
vector, with |ˆdν(k)| = 0. Here, ν = K, K(cid:48). The pseudospin vector equivalently follows
from taking the expectation value (cid:104)σ(cid:105) of the Floquet-Bloch states around K, K(cid:48).

As discussed in the main text, the band inversion at K(cid:48) is trivial, and the pseudospin

obeys dy

K(k) = 0. Conversely, at K, the pseudospin becomes

(cid:2)v1kx + v3(k2

y), v1ky − 2v3kxky, M − B|k|2(cid:3)(cid:62)

x − k2

ˆdK(k) =

1

N (k)

(S10)

with a normalization N (k) to ensure that |ˆdK(k)| = 1.

At K, the eﬀective Hamiltonian S9 can be viewed as a d-wave generalization of the

conventional massive Dirac Hamiltonian, with an additional band mass term in analogy

to the k.p model at Γ for HgTe/CdTe quantum wells. Figure S1 depicts the pseudospin
textures upon increasing v3/v1 to enhance trigonal distortion. v1 (cid:54)= 0, v3 = 0 recovers the

conventional massive Dirac fermion with a quadratic band mass term; here, the pseudospin
has a p-wave winding around K(cid:48) and the Chern number becomes C = 1. In the opposite
limit v1 = 0, v3 (cid:54)= 0, the pseudospin acquires a d-wave winding around K. Here, since
the band mass term is quadratic only, the winding in dx(k), dy(k) persists in principle to
k → ∞. Given the knowledge that the band structure is gapped globally and that the

band inversion should be conﬁned to high-symmetry points, this behavior is an artifact

of the lower-order k.p expansion.

More rigorously, quantization of the integral C = 1

R2 dkF(k) necessitates a com-
pactiﬁcation of k-space R2 to a non-contractible manifold. This can be motivated as

(cid:82)

2π

follows: Since the Floquet k.p theory can be expected to faithfully represent the physics
only in the close vicinity around K, momenta k far away from K should not aﬀect C.

26

This can be enforced rigorously by adding to ˆH an inﬁnitesimal rotationally-symmetric
regularizer −ηB(cid:48)ˆσz|k|4 with η → 0, leading to:

(cid:2)v1kx + v3(k2

It follows that the unit vector ˆd(reg)

the north pole without loss of information. The choice ˆσz of the regularizer is motivated
by noting that |B| (cid:29) |v3| for any choice of pump ﬁeld entails that ˆd(|k| → ∞) ∼
−sgn(B)ˆez + v3|B|[cos(2θ)ˆex − sin(2θ)ˆey] already approximately points in the z-direction.
The band inversion can be seen clearly by looking at the behavior of dz(k) close to
K, which switches sign when going from k = 0 to k → ∞. The intermediate regime

of p-d-wave winding leads to a distorted pseudospin texture when looking at the close

vicinity of K, whereas a d-wave (or p-wave) texture is retained at large k to arrive at a

C = 2 or C = 1 phase.

Strong Pumping and Inversion of the Equilibrium Band Gap

Discussions on photo-induced chiral edge states have focused so far solely on dynamically-

generated gaps within the equilibrium conduction and valence bands, since a sizeable
energy scale ∼ 1.5eV in WS2 protects the equilibrium band gap from closing for weak

pump ﬁelds. This picture changes conceivably when approaching the regime of Wannier-

Stark physics at signiﬁcantly higher pump strength. In the high-frequency limit, broken

time-reversal symmetry then bestows an optical Stark shift of equal and opposite magni-
tude on K and K(cid:48), that bridges the equilibrium band gap at a critical ﬁeld strength A.
The gap closes and reopens at K(cid:48) to eliminate one branch of the trivial equilibrium edge

states, leaving a single chiral edge state to bridge the Floquet-Bloch band gap at K, as

depicted in Fig. 2(a). Upon even further increase of A, the gap ﬁnally closes and reopens

27

at Γ, returning to a trivial regime without chiral edge modes. Na¨ıvely, the ﬂattening

of the bands upon crossover to Wannier-Stark ladders at increasing pump strengths A

or decreasing frequencies Ω suggests that one should not expect to continue attributing

special signiﬁcance to the original high-symmetry points in this regime. Nevertheless, the
system can undergo a series of gap closings conﬁned to K, K(cid:48), Γ upon further decrease
of Ω. The associated topological transitions change the Floquet Chern number by ±1,

leading to a mosaic of photo-induced topological phases at high pump intensities. In ad-

dition, gap closures occur near the second conduction-band minimum Q in WS2. As this

is not a high-symmetry point, C3 rotation symmetry dictates that the gap must instead

close simultaneously at three distinct points in the Brillouin zone, changing the Chern
number by ±3. We veriﬁed the corresponding phase diagram in Fig. 2(b) by numerically

evaluating the Floquet Chern number.

Figure S1: Floquet-Bloch pseudospin textures at K and K(cid:48). (a) At K the pseudospin
texture interpolates between p-wave (v1 (cid:54)= 0, v3 = 0) and d-wave (v1 = 0, v3 (cid:54)= 0) winding
upon increase of trigonal distortion. Given a-priori knowledge that the band structure
remains gapped globally, a topological invariant can be assigned by introducing a regu-
larizer η that ensures that the pseudospin points into the z direction for k → ∞ and the
k-space manifold can thus be compatiﬁed to a sphere. Trigonal distortion is seen clearly
when zooming into the vicinity of the K point, as depicted in (b). Here, little information
can be gleaned from the intermediate p-d wave texture, however globally a d-wave winding
appears as seen in (a). At K(cid:48), the pseudospin is trivial, with the y-component always
zero, depicted in (c).

Figure S2: Photo-induced inversion of the equilibrium band gap in WS2 for strong pump
ﬁelds, for spin-↓. (a) A suﬃciently blue-detuned pump ﬁeld closes the gap selectively at
a single valley K(cid:48), transitioning into a C = 1 phase. One of the two trivial equilibrium
edge states disappears, leaving a single chiral edge mode that spans the band gap. The
corresponding phase diagram of Floquet Chern numbers at strong pump strengths is
depicted in (b), with (a) corresponding to parameters A = 0.9, ω = 2.7eV . Further
increase of the pump amplitude or decrease of frequency triggers additional gap closings
at K, Γ, and around the second conduction band minimum Q, inducing a mosaic of
possible Chern numbers for the photo-modulated valence band. Closing the gap at K,
K(cid:48) changes the Chern number by ±1, whereas C3 symmetry dictates closing the gap at
Q must happen at three points in the Brillouin zone, triggering a change of the Chern
number by ±3. Progressive ﬂattening of the valence band dispersion at strong pump ﬁelds
indicates the onset of Wannier-Stark physics.
