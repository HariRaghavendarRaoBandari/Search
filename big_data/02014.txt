ABSTRACT

Recently, a fading radio transient after the fast radio burst (FRB) 150418 was discovered and its
cosmological redshift was measured by Keane et al. (2016). This afterglow lasting ∼ 6 days is largely in
agreement with the radio afterglow of a short gamma-ray burst (SGRB), and thus the double neutron
star (NS-NS) merger model for this FRB is favored. Here we suggest that an FRB could originate from
the magnetic interaction between two NSs during their inspiral, within the framework of a unipolar
inductor model. In this model, an electromotive force is induced on one NS to accelerate electrons.
We show that coherent curvature radiation from these electrons in the magnetosphere of the other NS
is responsible for the observed FRB signal, that is, the characteristic luminosity, duration, frequency
and event rate of an FRB can be well understood. In addition, we discuss several implications of this
model, including possible associations of FRBs with SGRB afterglows and gravitational wave events.

1. INTRODUCTION

2015; Masui et al.

2012; Thornton et al.

Fast radio bursts (FRB) are ﬂashes with durations
of order 1 ms at typical frequencies of ∼ 1 GHz. Up to
now, 17 FRBs have been detected (Lorimer et al.
2007; Keane et al.
2013;
Burke-Spolaor & Bannister 2014; Spitler et al. 2014,
2016; Ravi, Shannon & Jameson 2015; Petroﬀ et al.
2015; Champion et al.
2015;
Keane et al. 2016).
Recently, a new FRB (FRB
150418) and its fading radio afterglow lasting ∼ 6 days
were reported (Keane et al. 2016). The host galaxy
associated with this afterglow has been identiﬁed to
be an elliptical galaxy with redshift z = 0.492 ± 0.008.
These observations provide strong evidence that at
least some FRBs locate at cosmological distances.
Besides, the observed dispersion measure of this source
is DMobs = 776.2 cm−3 pc, being in agreement with
those of the other FRBs (∼ 500 − 2000 cm−3 pc).

Many models have been proposed to explain the
properties of FRBs,
including giant ﬂares from mag-
netars (Popov & Postnov 2010; Kulkarni et al. 2014),
annihilations of mini-black holes (BHs) (Keane et al.
2012), NS-NS mergers (Totani 2013), NS-BH merg-
ers (Mingarelli, Levin & Lazio 2015), double whiter
dwarf mergers
(Kashiyama, Ioka & M´esz´aros 2013),
blitzars (Falcke & Rezzolla 2014; Zhang 2014), erup-
tions of nearby ﬂaring stars (Loeb, Shvartzvald & Maoz
2014), collisions between NSs and asteroids/comets
giant pulses
(Geng & Huang 2015),
from pulsars
(Connor, Sievers & Pen
2016; Cordes & Wasserman
2016), charged BH-BH mergers (Zhang 2016a), and
so on. However, some of these models are clearly
inconsistent with a high kinetic energy required by the
observed radio afterglow of FRB 150418, as argued by
Zhang (2016b).

Although observations of FRB 110523 (Masui et al.
2015) and FRB 121102 (Spitler et al. 2014, 2016) seem

to disfavor the NS-NS merger model, as indicated by the
classiﬁcation of gamma-ray bursts, at least two distinct
classes of FRBs should exist (Keane et al. 2016), which
is also suggested by a recent statistic analysis (Li et al.
2016). Recent observations of the fading radio after-
glow of FRB 150418 associated with an elliptical galaxy
show that this FRB is very likely to be contemporaneous
with a short gamma-ray burst (SGRB), and thus the NS-
NS merger model is strongly favored (Keane et al. 2016;
Zhang 2016b). This conclusion is further supported by
the fact that the optimistic estimate rate of NS-NS merg-
ers (Abadie et al. 2010) is statistically consistent with
the FRB rate, as noted by Totani (2013).

The merger of two NSs after the FRB could lead to a
rapidly rotating BH (Pacz´ynski 1986; Eichler et al. 1989;
Narayan, Pacz´ynski & Piran 1992; Rezzolla et al. 2011)
or a millisecond pulsar/magnetar (Dai & Lu 1998a,b;
Dai et al. 2006; Zhang 2013), which may be surrounded
by a transient torus. Such objects have been widely ar-
gued as both the central engine of SGRBs and one source
of gravitational wave (GW) events that could be de-
tected by the advanced LIGO. The ultra-relativistic out-
ﬂow producing an SGRB would subsequently sweep up
its ambient rareﬁed gas and could drive multi-waveband
afterglows including a fading radio transient discovered
by Keane et al. (2016). This afterglow is clearly much
brighter than that studied by Yi, Gao & Zhang (2014),
who assumed a much lower kinetic energy of the FRB
ejecta.

In the scenario described above, the physical mech-
anism of FRBs remains a mystery.
In this Letter, we
study the physical processes of forming an FRB within
the framework of a unipolar inductor model. This
model has been proposed to describe a kind of mag-
netic interaction in NS-NS systems, by which energy
can be extracted during the binary inspiral (Piro 2012;
Lai 2012). This leads to electromagnetic radiation be-

binary in electromagnetic waves as a function of time, where the

Lai 2012). As we show below, this magnitude of resis-
tance is reasonable. The factor of 2 is introduced because
the circuit could be established on both upper and lower
sides of the binary orbit. However, this circuit is unsta-
ble, since a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld is produced and grows
even to be comparable to the poloidal ﬁeld. Thus, Lai
(2012) proposed a quasi-cyclic circuit model, in which
when the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld is strong enough, the
circuit breaks down and then the magnetic energy is re-
leased due to the reconnection process. Subsequently,
the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld becomes weak and the whole
cycle repeats. In this case, the energy dissipation rate is
(Lai 2012)

˙Ediss = 1.7 × 1042B2

∗,12a−7

30 erg/s,

(2)

where B∗,12 = B∗/1012 G and a30 = a/30 km. This is
consistent with the energy dissipation rate given by the
simulations of Palenzuela et al. (2013). Thus we believe
that the resistance used here is reasonable.

Even if a small fraction of the binary orbital energy is
extracted by the magnetic interaction, evolution of the
NS-NS binary is dominated by gravitational waves (Lai
2012), following

,

(3)

where q = Mc/M∗ is the mass ratio of two stars
(Landau & Lifshitz 1975). For simplicity, we set M∗ =
1.4M⊙, R∗ = Rc = 10 km and q = 1. Thus we obtain

where we set the zero time when the surfaces of two NSs
just touch with each other, i.e. a = 20 km at t = 0.
Therefore, the time evolution of the power of electro-
magnetic radiation ( ˙Ediss) is obtained, as shown in Fig 2.

3. MODELING AN FRB

The magnetosphere of a pulsar is ﬁlled with a plasma,
as described by Goldreich & Julian (1969). Since the pri-
mary NS has a much stronger magnetic ﬁeld and we here

fore the ﬁnal merger. Even though Totani (2013) and
Mingarelli, Levin & Lazio (2015) argued that the merg-
ers of NS-NS/BH binaries could be progenitors of FRBs,
they have not carried out an analysis and modeling of
relevant physical processes. We here test whether this
unipolar inductor model is responsible for FRBs. In Sec-
tion 2, we brieﬂy introduce the unipolar inductor model.
In Section 3, we apply it to an FRB. In Section 4, we
present our summary and discussion.

2. THE UNIPOLAR INDUCTOR MODEL

The

unipolar

put
the ﬁrst

inductor model was

for-
ward in the Jupiter-Io system for
time
(Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1969). This model was then
applied to several systems, such as double white dwarf
binaries
(Wu et al. 2002) and NS-NS/BH binaries
(Hansen & Lyutikov 2001; McWilliams & Levin 2011;
Piro 2012; Lai 2012). Usually, one of two NSs in this
model has a much stronger magnetic ﬁeld than that
of the other NS. Recent simulations show that this
model is still likely to be established, even if the ratio
of the magnetic ﬁeld strengths of two NSs is ∼ 100
(Palenzuela et al. 2013).

Considering a primary NS with mass M∗, spin Ω∗,
magnetic dipole moment µ∗ = B∗R3
∗ and radius R∗, and
its companion NS with mass Mc and radius Rc. The
distance between the two NSs is a and the orbital an-
gular velocity is Ω. We assume that Ω∗, µ∗ and Ω
are aligned for simplicity. As the companion crosses the
magnetic ﬁeld lines of the primary NS, an electromotive
force (EMF) is generated as shown in Fig. 1, E ≃ 2Rc|E|,
where E = v × B/c, B = µ/a3 and v = (Ω − Ω∗) × a
(Piro 2012; Lai 2012). During the inspiralling stage, spin-
orbit synchronization cannot be achieved by magnetic
and tidal torques (Bildsten & Cutler 1992; Kochanek
1992; Lai 1994; Ho & Lai 1999; Lai 2012), so the spin
of the primary NS could be much smaller than the or-
bital angular velocity and we assume that v ∼ Ωa. Thus
the EMF is given by

E ≃

2µRc
ca2 Ω.

(1)

The magnetic ﬁeld lines exhibit like electric wires and
thus a current loop is established. The resistance of the
circuit (Rtot) is generally believed to be dominated by
the magnetosphere, which is in units of the impedance
of free space, namely Rtot ≃ 2Rmag = 8π/c (Piro 2012;

assume that the plasma is mainly produced by the pri-
mary star, whose magnetic ﬁeld is B∗ = B∗,12 × 1012 G

where ρ is the curvature radius, and γ is the Lorentz
factor of a radiating electron. For a typical FRB with
νcurv ∼ 1 GHz, we obtain γ = 52ρ1/3

ρ/10 km. The condition that the curvature radiation can
propagate through the plasma is that νcurv > νp. Com-
bining equation (6) with equation (7), we get

comparable to the size of the emission region, the emis-
sion is coherent (Ruderman & Sutherland 1975). Thus
the total power by coherent radiation is

The electrons/positrons are accelerated mainly by the
EMF, while radiation cools them down. In the surface
of the companion, the drift velocity of the electrons is
vd ∼ cEk/B, where Ek is the parallel component of the
electric ﬁeld along the magnetic ﬁeld, which has a small
value for the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in our model.
Thus, the drift velocity vd . c and thus the curvature ra-
dius of the electron motion could be approximately the
synchrotron gyration radius. The electron energy after
acceleration could be determined by the balance between
the “synchrotron-like” cooling and electric ﬁeld acceler-
ation, that is,

Combining with the upper and lower limits given by
Equations (8), (10) and (13) and noting that the electron
density is related to the magnetic ﬁeld of the primary star
as shown in Equation (5), we can obtain constraints on
parameters such as B∗ and a. An example is shown in
Fig. 3 with assumptions of ρ10 = 2, P0.4 = 1 and r25 = 1.
The gray region means an appropriate parameter space
for a successful FRB. Thus our model can well explain
an FRB. In addition, the dispersion measure contributed
by the Goldreich-Julian density is (Yu 2014)

DMGJ = Z nedl ∼ 0.007B∗,12P −1

0.4 pc/cm3 ≪ DMobs.

(14)

This dispersion measure is thus negligible.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this Letter, we have studied the physical processes
of an FRB and explained its main features within the
framework of the unipolar inductor model of an inspi-
ralling NS-NS binary. The companion non-magnetic
NS crosses the magnetosphere of the primary highly-
magnetized NS and simultaneously produces an EMF,
by which electrons are accelerated. These electrons could
then move along the magnetic ﬁeld lines and generate co-
herent curvature radiation as presented in Fig. 1. The to-
tal power and timescale are well consistent with a typical
FRB as shown in Fig. 2.

Our model is clearly diﬀerent from the SGRB/FRB as-
sociation scenario proposed by Zhang (2016a), who sug-
gested that the inspiral of a charged BH-BH binary forms
a current loop and produces an induced magnetic ﬁeld.
This ﬁeld, if co-rotating with the BHs around the center
of mass of the binary system, would behave like a “gi-
ant pulsar”. The coherent curvature radiation from the
magnetosphere of this pulsar-like object could explain an
FRB. In what follows, we would like to discuss several
implications of our model.

First, since the direction of curvature radiation might
not be aligned with the orbital angular momentum that
is just along a subsequent SGRB, it is not necessary to
observe an FRB and an SGRB contemporaneously. In
fact, only one FRB detected so far is associated with an
SGRB (Keane et al. 2016).

Second, the coherent curvature radiation does not
point to us at all of the times during one orbital pe-
riod. Thus, for binaries with stronger magnetic inter-
action, we might observe an FRB signal in two peri-
ods, which might be responsible for an FRB with double
peaks (Champion et al. 2015).

Third, X-ray emission is also predicted in the
unipolar
(Hansen & Lyutikov 2001;
McWilliams & Levin 2011; Lai 2012; Palenzuela et al.
2013). Following McWilliams & Levin (2011), a fraction

inductor model

of energy will be kept in the form of plasma kinetic en-
ergy. When this plasma reaches the primary NS, a hot
spot might be induced. However, this hot spot would
be observed only for a source at distance . 100 Mpc
(McWilliams & Levin 2011).

Finally, the mergers of NS-NS binaries are both the
central engine of SGRBs and one of the candidate sources
of GW events that could be detected by the advanced
LIGO. Thus, it would be expected to see possible asso-
ciations of FRBs with SGRB afterglows and GW events
in the future. The detections/non-detections of such as-
sociations would conﬁrm/constrain/exclude our model.
