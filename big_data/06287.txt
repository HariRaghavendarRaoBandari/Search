Large deviations of radial statistics in
the two-dimensional one-component
plasma

Abstract The two-dimensional one-component plasma is an ubiquitous model
for several vortex systems. For special values of the coupling constant βq2
(where q is the particles charge and β the inverse temperature), the model
also corresponds to the eigenvalues distribution of normal matrix models.
Several features of the system are discussed in the limit of large number N
of particles for generic values of the coupling constant. We show that the
statistics of a class of radial observables produces a rich phase diagram, and
their asymptotic behaviour in terms of large deviation functions is calculated
explicitly, including next-to-leading terms up to order 1/N . We demonstrate
a split-oﬀ phenomenon associated to atypical ﬂuctuations of the edge density
proﬁle. We also show explicitly that a failure of the ﬂuid phase assumption of
the plasma can break a genuine 1/N -expansion of the free energy. Our ﬁnd-
ings are corroborated by numerical comparisons with exact ﬁnite-N formulae
valid for βq2 = 2.

with logarithmic interactions. The simplest example of models in this class

is the two-dimensional one-component plasma (2D-OCP). This system is
also known in literature as ‘jellium’, 2D Dyson’s gas or 2D Coulomb gas [4,
16,22,25,31,33,43,49]. The 2D-OCP consists of N identical classical point-
like particles, each carrying a charge q (one species of particle) on a two-
dimensional domain. The Coulomb interaction between any two particles at
distance r from each other is −q2v(r), where v(r) obeys the Poisson equation.
In the planar case v(r) = log(|r|/L), where L is a length scale that ﬁxes the
zero of the potential. To ensure charge neutrality, the particles are embedded
in a ﬁxed neutralizing background with opposite charge −qN . The canonical
distribution of the 2D-OCP at inverse temperature β is

In (2), ri = (xi, yi) ∈ R2 denotes the position of the i-th particle of the
2D-OCP (i = 1, . . . , N ) and | · | denotes the Euclidean distance. The ﬁrst
term in H (r1, . . . , rN ) is the particle-particle contribution to the energy,
while the second term is the particle-background contribution (the 2D-OCP
experiences the electrostatic potential V generated by the ﬁxed background).
The coupling constant βq2 is often referred to as plasma parameter.

This statistical mechanics ﬂuid model has appeared in several areas of
physics and mathematics. Indeed, the logarithmic repulsion in (2) does oc-
cur as interaction between vortices and dislocations in real systems such as
superconductors [42], superﬂuids, rotating Bose-Einstein condensates [17,18,
41] (we refer to [2] and [45] for detailed reviews). There is also a well-known
analogy between the canonical measure (3) of the 2D-OCP and the Laughlin
trial wave function [36] (in the symmetric gauge) in the theory of fractional
quantum Hall eﬀect [11]. In the large N limit with ﬁxed potential (without
the factor N in front of V (r/L)), the 2D-OCP is equivalent to a class of
growth models known as ‘Laplacian growth’ [49, 50].
In the following q and L will be set to one for simplicity. For notational
convenience, we also identify R2 (cid:39) C and denote the positions of the particles
in the plane by complex numbers z1, . . . , zN . With these conventions, (1)-(2)

For β = 1, 2 and 4, (3) turns out to be the eigenvalues joint distribu-
tion of normal matrix ensembles with real, complex or quaternionic entries
respectively [34,8,27]. Remarkably, at inverse temperature β = 2, (3) is a
determinantal point process. When the background ﬁlls uniformly the unit
disk D = {|z| ≤ 1}, the plasma particles experience a quadratic conﬁnement
V (z) = |z|2/2 and, for β = 2, the system is integrable (the partition function

3

is known exactly for ﬁnite N ). In this case, (3) describes the eigenvalues dis-
tribution of the celebrated complex Ginibre ensemble [29]. The 2D Coulomb
gas analogy has been extensively used in random matrix theory to investi-
gate the large dimensional limit of random normal matrices since the seminal
works of Dyson [22].

The present paper deals with some macroscopic features of the 2D-OCP.
We present explicit results for the disk conﬁguration of the background. Our
quantities of interest are the radial moments ∆(p)

have been chosen in order to have ∆(p)

N = O(1) for all p.

The aim of this paper is to derive the asymptotic distribution of this
class of radial observables in the limit of large number N of particles at
logarithmic scales1 (i.e. including the large deviation tails). Our ﬁndings can

where the left (L) and right (R) large deviation functions are computed
explicitly (see (35) and (36) below). Note the diﬀerent exponential rates
of suppression for x ≤ 1 (O(N 2)) and x > 1 (O(N )). In the derivation
of our results, it will be clear that the ﬂuctuations for x ≤ 1 are driven
by a collective behaviour of the charges; on the contrary, the ﬂuctuations
to the right x > 1 are associated to a spontaneous symmetry breaking in
the problem (the equilibrium conﬁguration breaks the rotational invari-
ance in the plane). This change of behaviour of the Coulomb gas is at the
heart of the change of speed in the large deviations tails. Moreover, based
on the analysis of the next-to-leading order corrections to (6), which we
are also able to obtain (see (51)), we show that a genuine 1/N -expansion
of the excess free energy for the 2D-OCP fails to exist if the ﬂuid phase
assumption is violated (i.e. when the plasma distribution becomes singu-
lar). Indeed, our computations show that, if the equilibrium distribution
of the Coulomb gas has a singular component, the large-N expansion of
log ZN,β includes a non-universal term of order O(N log N ).

N (s) is nothing but the excess free energy of
the 2D-OCP. This free energy is given by the electrostatic energy term
Ep(s) at leading order, while the ﬁrst 1/N -correction is just a conﬁgu-
rational entropy term Sp(s). The explicit forms of Ep(s) and Sp(s) are
given in (69) and (70). For p = 1 (mean radial displacement) we recover
recent results [19]. Amusingly, for 0 < p < 2 the leading order term Ep(s)
has a weak non-analytic point at s = 0 due to a change in topology of
the plasma distribution. Furthermore, the order of the phase transition
(i.e. the order of the ﬁrst non-continuous derivative of Ep(s) at s = 0),
while being always at least 3, depends on the parameter p (the larger p
the weaker the transition). These non-analyticities of the free energy at
the ground state of the plasma unveil a non-regular behaviour of the high
order cumulants of ∆(p)
N that cannot be detected by a standard Gaussian
approximation.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss some aspects of the
thermodynamic limit of the 2D-OCP and we introduce the main quantities
of interest. Section 3 contains a brief review on the role of the 2D-OCP in
random matrix models where some ﬁnite-N formulae are available for β = 2.
These results will be used to substantiate our ﬁndings. In section 4 we present
our results on the edge density proﬁle ∆(∞)
N . In particular, in subsections 4.1
and 4.2 we demonstrate the split-oﬀ mechanism and we show the break-
down of the free energy 1/N -expansion for a constrained 2D-OCP. The large
deviation functions of the radial moments ∆(p)
N (p ﬁnite) are considered in
section 5. We conclude with some ﬁnal remarks in section 6.

2 Thermodynamics of the 2D-OCP

In order to describe the large N limit of the 2D-OCP, it is useful to introduce
the normalized density of the gas

N(cid:88)

i=1

µ =

1
N

δzi .

(8)

For large N , when the density approaches a macroscopic limit, the partition
function ZN,β of the 2D-OCP can be written as a functional integral over
densities

ZN,β =

[Dµ]e−βN 2A[µ] ,

(9)
where A is the so-called action that can be determined as follows. Assuming
a ﬂuid phase for the 2D-OCP, one expects that the partition function admits

(cid:90)

5

a large-N expansion [48,49]. Under this assumption, the leading order con-
tributions to A are given by the electrostatic energy and the conﬁgurational
entropy of the Coulomb gas. The energetic contribution comes from

βH(z1, . . . , zN ) = βN 2E[µ] +

dµ(z) log (cid:96)(z) + ··· .

be chosen as (cid:96)(z)−1 =(cid:112)N (dµ(z)/dz). A second contribution to the action
microscopic variables zk’s to µ: (cid:81)

In the continuous limit, this functional needs to be corrected by introducing
a cut-oﬀ that regularizes the particles self-interaction. This correction is pro-
vided by the second term in (10), where the short-distance cut-oﬀ (cid:96)(z) can
A arises from the Jacobian J of the change of integration variables from the
k dzk = [Dµ]N !elog J[µ], where the factor
N ! takes into account the symmetry under permutations of the charges. A

(14)

is the conﬁgurational entropy of the gas density. Note that the 1/N -order of
the action vanishes at inverse temperature β = 4. The action representation
(9) of the partition function is amenable to a saddle-point approximation;
for large N , the value of ZN,β is given by the action A[µeq] evaluated at
the equilibrium density µeq, i.e. the minimizer of the mean-ﬁeld energy func-
tional E. The leading term of the action is then E[µeq]. Lebl´e and Serfaty [46,
Eq. (1.19)] have recently proved that, under regularity assumptions on the
equilibrium measure µeq, the coeﬃcient of the next-to-leading term is univer-
sal and equal to Cβ = −β/4 (the universality of Cβ was already known for
the 2D-OCP constrained on the line [12,23,10]). In section 4 we will see that
this is not the case when µeq has singular components (non-ﬂuid phase). This
explicit example shows that the assumption [46, Eq. (2.7)] of µeq having a
density (used to prove the universality of Cβ) is pertinent and not only tech-
nical. The next correction for large N is given by the conﬁgurational entropy
S[µeq]. Note, however, that if the saddle-point density is not in a ﬂuid phase

6

the conﬁgurational entropy (14) diverges, as dµeq(z)/dz is not ﬁnite on the
set of singular points. From now on, we focus on the harmonic potential case

V (z) =

|z|2 .

(15)

As already mentioned in the introduction, this quadratic potential is gener-
ated by a uniform background in the unit disk D = {|z| ≤ 1}. The relevance
of this choice in random matrix theory will be discussed later. It is well-known
that, in the limit of large number of particles, the 2D-OCP in the harmonic
potential (15) concentrates in a bounded region of the plane. Not surpris-
ingly, the limiting distribution of the plasma is the uniform distribution on
the unit disk

µdisk =

1
π

1D ,

(16)

which is exactly the conﬁguration of the 2D-OCP that neutralizes the uniform
background of opposite charge. This distribution on the disk is known as
circular law in random matrix theory [7,8, 30]. The electrostatic energy and
the entropy of the gas are then easy to compute,

E[µdisk] =

,

S[µdisk] = log π .

(17)

For β = 2, detailed results on the typical ﬂuctuations of radially symmet-
ric observables of this system have been obtained exploiting the aforemen-
tioned determinantal structure. In the next section, we summarize some of
these results.

3 The integrable case β = 2 and random matrices

At β = 2, the canonical distribution of the 2D-OCP (3) assumes a determi-
nantal structure and provides a model whose partition function and correla-
tion functions can be computed explicitly [14, 34]. The probability measure

of the N eigenvalues z1, . . . , zN of N−1/2G is given by (18) with partition
function ZN,2 = [1!2!··· N !] πN N− N (N +1)

Kostlan in [35] managed to integrate out the angular variables θj of the
eigenvalues zj = rjeiθj , and showed that, up to a random reshuﬄing, the
eigenvalues moduli rj = |zi| are distributed as a collection of independent

A similar result has been recently established [13] for a general class of ra-
dially symmetric external potentials V (z) = V (|z|). Rider’s theorem (22)
describes the typical ﬂuctuations of the ‘top eigenvalue’ of complex Ginibre
matrices. In this work, we address the question of atypical ﬂuctuations. Few
explicit results are available on large deviations for the 2D-OCP, and they
are usually valid at the leading order in N , see [5,19,32].

Forrester [26] obtained a ﬁnite-N formula for the moment generating
function of radially symmetric linear statistics. Specializing his result to ∆(p)

For a rigorous proof of central limit theorems at β = 2 for radially sym-
metric observables (including ∆(p)
N with average and variance as above) see
[40]. Atypical ﬂuctuations are not described, of course, within the Gaussian
approximation. Formulae (21), (23) and (24) will be used in the next sections
to corroborate numerically our results, as well as to prove some of our claims
for β = 2.

4 Large deviations of the edge density proﬁle

The large N distribution of the plasma µdisk (16) implies that the edge density
proﬁle ∆(∞)
N = maxk rk of the 2D-OCP converges to x = 1 as N → ∞. For
β = 2, it is known that the typical ﬂuctuations of the edge, i.e. the ‘top
eigenvalue’ of Ginibre matrices, are described by a Gumbel distribution (see
previous section). These typical ﬂuctuations are of order O(1/
N ). Our
goal is to ﬁnd, for all β > 0, the statistical law of the ﬂuctuations of ∆(∞)
N of
order O(1) (hence, atypical). This amounts to computing the following large
N limit

(26)
where ZN,β(x) is the partition function of the 2D-OCP with the constraint
rk ≤ x for k = 1, . . . , N . As discussed in section 2, (−1/βN 2) log ZN,β(x) is
dominated for large N by the saddle-point of the action in (9). The saddle-
point is given by the distribution of the plasma that minimizes the electro-
static energy functional

Finding the minimizer of a logarithmic potential under constraints is usu-
ally a technically involved task. From electrostatic considerations, we know
that the equilibrium distribution of the plasma concentrates on a compact
set. In the interior of the support, the distribution has constant density 1/π

9

and the excess of charges accumulates on the boundary of the support3. Note
that the support of the distribution is itself unknown. In our case, we can
take advantage of the rotational symmetry of the problem and eventually we

For x ≥ 1, the saddle-point density is independent of x (the constraint on
the 2D-OCP is ineﬀective). When x < 1, the constraint forces the 2D-OCP
in a smaller disk and a fraction of charge accumulates on the boundary of
the disk. More precisely, in the interior of the disk of radius x the density
is constant and equal to 1/π; the exceeding charge (1 − x2) lies exactly on
the boundary of the disk and, by symmetry, is uniformly distributed. Hence,
for x < 1 the equilibrium distribution has a singular component (the delta
measure at distance x = r in (30)) and we say that the plasma is not in a
ﬂuid phase. Evaluating E[µx] and using (17) for E[µdisk] we get

where θ(x) is the Heaviside theta function. Note that (31) is identically zero
for x ≥ 1, while for x → 1− it vanishes as (x− 1)3. Therefore the third-order
derivative of the large deviation function (31) is discontinuous at x = 1.
Similar non-analiticities in the large deviation function of the edge density
proﬁle for 2D Coulomb gases in one dimension have been recorded in previous
works on Hermitian random matrices [38].

Inspired by the phenomenology of 2D Coulomb gases on the line [21,24,

37,38] we ask for the existence of the nontrivial limit

N→∞
N (x) = (cid:104)δ(∆(∞)
where P (∞)
N − x)(cid:105) is the probability that the edge density takes
value x. The idea is to compute this limit as energy cost of a conﬁguration
with one charge of the Coulomb gas at distance x > 1. Our intuition is
that, for large N , the most probable conﬁguration of the gas with at least
one particle at distance x > 1 is described by the (unperturbed) equilibrium
measure µdisk (i.e., the circular law) with one single particle at distance x.
Among all possible realizations of the constraint ∆(∞)
N = x (with x > 1), this
is the least energetic one. The presence of one particle outside the unit disk
corresponds to a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the system: the problem
is symmetric under rotations U (1) in the complex plane, however the plasma
conﬁguration with the split-oﬀ of a single particle is necessarily no longer
symmetric. The computation of (32) therefore amounts to estimating the
energy cost in pulling one particle away from its equilibrium position inside

energy of a 2D-OCP constrained on a disk of radius smaller than 1 does not
have a genuine 1/N -expansion: the presence of spurious logarithmic terms in
the large-N expansion is due to the constrained 2D-OCP being in a non-ﬂuid

4.1 Proof of the split-oﬀ mechanism for β = 2

In the previous section we have computed the limit (32) using large devia-
tions ideas. A key step in the computation was ﬁnding the typical plasma
distribution realizing the atypical event ∆(∞)
N = x with x > 1. Guided by
intuition, we have guessed that the typical way for the 2D-OCP to satisfy
the constraint on the edge density proﬁle is by a split-oﬀ mechanism. Evalu-
ating the limit as energy cost for the splitting we found (34). Here we obtain
the same result (i.e. Ψ (∞)
R (x)) using an asymptotic expansion of a ﬁnite-N
formula, thus proving the split-oﬀ phenomenon.

Let us consider the ﬁnite-N formula (21) valid at β = 2:

for t ≤ 1 < x, and hence we get

Thia proves, at least for β = 2, that the typical conﬁguration of the 2D-OCP

N > 1 is given by the unperturbed uniform distribution
on the unit disk with one charge located at distance x > 1 from the origin
(hence one charge splits from µdisk).

We have seen that the plasma under the constraint rk ≤ x ≤ 1 is not in a

on the boundary of the disk and the plasma distribution is not absolutely
continuous. We want to show here that the excess free energy of the 2D-OCP
with hard constraints does not admit a genuine 1/N -expansion.

The expression (47) lends itself to an evaluation in a saddle-point approxima-
tion. The largest contribution to the integral comes from the neighborhood
of the point that minimizes the exponent gξ(t) = t − ξ log t. This function
achieves its global minimum at t = ξ, which may or may not be in the interior
of the integration range [0, x2].

Let us ﬁrst consider the expansion in the case of 1/N < ξ < x2 (saddle-
point in the interior of the integration range). Then, we can expand the
exponential term around t = ξ and obtain

Note the nonzero coeﬃcient of O(log N/N ). This explicit calculation shows
that when the 2D Coulomb gas is not in a ﬂuid phase (here for x < 1), the
coeﬃcient Cβ in the large-N asymptotics (13) is not universal and there-
fore the excess free energy log(ZN,β(x)/ZN,β) does not admit a genuine
1/N -expansion. Note that here the hard constraint rk ≤ x has more dra-
matic consequences on the free energy expansion of the 2D-OCP compared
to the one-dimensional case (Hermitian random matrices), where the large-N
expansion is not aﬀected by the presence of hard walls [9,15]. The expan-
sion (51) has been compared with the exact β = 2 formula. See Fig. 2.

The leading term (59) is the rescaled cumulant generating function of ∆(p)
N ,
while Sp(s) in (60) provides the O(1/N ) correction to the cumulants. In
this case, the O(N log N ) term in the expansion of log Z (p)
N,β(s) is universal
(|z|) is suﬃciently regular [46]) and hence we have no
(the potential V (p)
logarithmic terms in the excess free energy (54)-(58).

To summarize, the statistics of ∆(p)

N is governed at leading order by the
electrostatic energy excess Ep(s) of the equilibirum distribution in the po-
tential V (p)
(independent of β) with the ﬁrst correction in 1/N expressed in
terms of a conﬁgurational entropy term Sp(s). Again, the technical challenge
is the solution of a constrained optimization problem. In the next section, we
solve the variational problem and we show that the statistical behaviour of
∆(p)

N is quite rich and depends on the exponent p > 0.

5.1 Solution of the variational problem

These diﬀerent ranges correspond to the stability values of s for the 2D-OCP
in the eﬀective potential (55). Observe that the equilibrium distribution µ(p)
will inherit the rotational symmetry of the energy functional E (p)
. In fact, the
minimization problem can be solved explicitly using the arguments presented
in [19]. A suitable modiﬁcation of those steps provides the solution of the
variational problem for s ∈ Ωp as

Note that as long as s ≥ 0 the eﬀective potential (55) is convex and therefore
the plasma distribution is supported on a disk (rp(s) = 0). However, for
p < 2, when s is negative the convexity of the potential is broken and the
inner radius rp(s) becomes positive. Hence, for s < 0 the support Σp(s) of the
plasma distribution is an annulus. This change of topology of the equilibrium
distribution has important consequences on the statistical behaviour of the
radial moments. The equilibrium measure µ(p)

where cp is a constant. Hence, Ep(s) is not analytic at s = 0 for 0 < p < 2.
Since Ep(s) is the leading order in N of the excess free energy (56), this
non-analyticities corresponds to phase transitions. Note that the phase tran-
sitions occurs at the ground state of the 2D-OCP (at s = 0) and correspond
exactly to the disk-to-annulus change in topology of the equilibrium plasma
distribution µ(p)
in (62). More precisely the (cid:96)-th derivative of Ep(s) is dis-
0 < p ≤ 2/3 we have a third-order phase transition, for 2/3 < p ≤ 1 a
fourth-order phase transition, for 1 < p ≤ 6/5 the transition is of order ﬁve,
and so on. For p = 2 the function Ep(s) is analytic. We stress that, although
the underlying mechanism is the same (the change in topology), the order of
the singularity in the free energies of the 2D-OCP depends on the particular
statistics 4, i.e. on the exponent p.

4 The fact that the order of the phase transition depends on the observable,
even if the macroscopic mechanism is the same, may appear surprising especially
if compared with previous works for the 2D-OCP on the line (Hermitian random
matrices, see e.g. [38]). A general treatment of phase transitions for 2D Coulomb
gases will appear in F. D. Cunden, P. Facchi, M. Ligab´o and P. Vivo, in preparation.

Having in mind these weak singularities, one can obtain the ﬁrst cumu-

limit of large number N of particles and for generic values of the coupling
constant.

For ﬁnite p, the moment generating function of the p-th radial moment
is obtained with logarithmic accuracy up to the ﬁrst sub-leading term in
the 1/N -expansion. The leading order Ep(s) of the excess free energy of the
plasma is shown to exhibit a weak non-analytic point at s = 0 for 0 < p < 2:
interestingly, the order of this non-analyticity (i.e. the order of the ﬁrst non-
continuous derivative), while being always larger or equal than 3, is found to
depend on p and arbitrarily weak singularities at s = 0 are possible. In the
mean-ﬁeld representation of the problem, these singularities are associated
to disk-to-annulus transitions in the equilibrium distribution of the plasma.
Since Ep(s) is the generating function of cumulants of ∆(p)
N at leading order
in N we expect that the non-continuity of the derivatives of Ep(s) at s = 0

may be related to a ‘non-regular’ behaviour of high cumulants as N → ∞.
For p = 1 this was numerically observed in [19].

We have considered in detail the edge density proﬁle ∆(∞)

N of the plasma
in the plane, i.e. the ﬂuctuations of the farthest particle from the origin. We
obtained the rate functions governing the probability of atypical ﬂuctuations
to the left and right of the expected position x = 1. The diﬀerence in speeds
(O(N 2) vs. O(N )) between the two large deviation principles is due to dif-
ferent arrangements of the ﬂuid particles realizing an atypical conﬁguration:
large ﬂuctuations to the left are realized cooperatively, while to the right
by a splitting-oﬀ mechanism, which breaks the rotational symmetry of the
ﬂuid. This physically intuitive explanation has been also demonstrated for
β = 2 by the asymptotic expansion of the ﬁnite-N formula (21). To the best
of our knowledge, this is one of the few existing proofs (at least in the ran-
dom matrix theory literature) of the split-oﬀ phenomenon associated to the
ﬂuctuations of the maximum of a set of correlated random variables ({rk} in
our problem)5.

It is worth noticing that, at odds with what generally happens in this
kind of problems, the large deviation result (31) does not exhibit a smooth
matching with the limiting result by Rider (Eq. (22)) for typical ﬂuctua-
tions to the left of the expected value, as the Gumbel distribution decays
too fast (super-exponentially) towards −∞ to meet the left rate function at
an exponential scale. This problem gives then rise to another of the very
few instances where the conventional matching between typical and atypical
ﬂuctuations is more delicate (see e.g. [44,47]).

A careful asymptotic analysis, extended to the ﬁrst two sub-leading or-
ders, also reveals that a genuine 1/N -expansion of the excess free energy
requires a ﬂuid-phase assumption; in our problem the equilibrium density µx
in (30) is not absolutely continuous for x < 1, and the large-N expansion of
log Pr[∆(∞)
N ≤ x] for β = 2 contains spurious logarithmic terms (see (51)).
This ﬂuid-phase condition should be compared with the so-called one-cut
assumption for the 2D-OCP on the line [10].

It would be interesting to see if the results reported in this paper can
be extended, at least qualitatively, to the 2D-OCP in more generic conﬁning
potentials [14,34,51] (other than radially symmetric [3, 30,28]) or for the
plasma on diﬀerent planar surfaces (e.g. on a cylinder [11]).

5 In fact, the only exact result we are aware of is [6, Theorem 6.2] for the largest
eigenvalue of GOE matrices. Later, the same right rate function was obtained in [37]
by means of Coulomb gas ideas with a split-oﬀ ansatz.
