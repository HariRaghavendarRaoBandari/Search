Electric dipole spin resonance in systems with a valley dependent g-factor

Department of Physics, University of Konstanz, D-78457 Konstanz, Germany

Marko J. Ranˇci´c and Guido Burkard

In this theoretical study we qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the electric dipole spin
resonance (EDSR) in a single Si/SiGe quantum dot in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld gradient,
e.g., produced by a ferromagnet. We model a situation in which the control of electron spin states
is achieved by applying an oscillatory electric ﬁeld, inducing real-space oscillations of the electron
inside the quantum dot. One of the goals of our study is to present a microscopic theory of valley
dependent g-factors in Si/SiGe quantum dots and investigate how valley relaxation combined with
a valley dependent g-factor leads to a novel electron spin dephasing mechanism. Furthermore,
we discuss the interplay of spin and valley relaxations in Si/SiGe quantum dots. Our ﬁndings
suggest that the electron spin dephases due to valley relaxation, and are in agreement with recent
experimental studies [Nature Nanotechnology 9, 666–670 (2014)].

I.

INTRODUCTION

Finding eﬃcient ways to use electron spins in quan-
tum dots (QDs) as quantum bits (qubits) has been an
active ﬁeld of research in condensed matter physics for
many years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. A necessary prerequisite for
building qubits are long coherence times, long enough to
allow for a large number of gate operations before the
quantum-mechanical nature of the qubit is irreversibly
lost [7]. An electron spin conﬁned in a semiconductor
quantum dot loses its quantum phase coherence due to
interactions with its noisy, solid state environment. Un-
avoidable interactions of the electron spin with surround-
ing charges and nuclear spins are common mechanisms
that limit the coherence time of the electron spin T ∗
2 to
as little as nanoseconds in some structures [2, 8, 9, 10].
In natural silicon only ≈ 4.7 % of the atomic nuclei
have a non-zero spin. Therefore, Si represents a logical
candidate for the implementation of spin qubits [4, 11,
12, 13]. There are two implementation strategies for spin
qubits in Si, using the nuclear spin of a phosphorus donor
in Si [14] and using spin states of an electron conﬁned
inside a Si quantum dot [15, 16, 17, 18]. Bulk silicon has
six minima of the conduction band, known as valleys. In
a Si/SiGe quantum well, four out of six valley states are
higher in energy due to strain at the Si/SiGe interface
[19]. The degeneracy of the remaining two valley states
can be lifted by the conﬁning potential in the z-direction
[20, 21].

In this paper we study a situation in which a ferromag-
net is embedded on top of the quantum dot, as shown
in Fig. 1. The in-plane component of the ferromagnet
stray magnetic ﬁeld, leads to the existence of a valley
dependent g-factor, as predicted in the following theo-
retical study [22]. The goal of our theoretical study is to
establish a quantitative relationship between valley de-
pendent g-factors and the tilt of the Si/SiGe interface.
Consequently, the ferromagnet embedded on top of the
quantum dot also leads to a valley dependent Rabi fre-
quency [23]. The valley dependent g-factor causes the
resonance condition to be diﬀerent for the two valleys,
and alongside with valley dependent Rabi frequencies,

microwaves.

leads to errors in controlling the electron spin state in
one of the valleys. Furthermore, when valley relaxation
is present, a novel decoherence mechanism exists which
cannot be reversed by a spin echo [24]. If the electron
is driven on resonance in one of the valleys, valley re-
laxation abruptly changes the resonance condition caus-
ing the electron spin to decohere. Another goal of this
manuscript is to describe the reduction of electron spin
coherence due to valley relaxation, by solving a Lind-
blad master equation. The presence of spin relaxation,
alongside with valley relaxation, leads to a rich interplay
of spin and valley relaxation, which is also described by
solving a Lindblad master equation.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Section II we
quantitatively describe the valley dependent g-factor in-
duced by an in-plane stray magnetic ﬁeld. We continue
by discussing the existence of a valley dependent Rabi
frequency in Section III. Subsequently, in Section IV we
present the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad equation for

the open-system dynamics of the electron spin and qual-
itatively and quantitatively describe the drop of the elec-
tron spin coherence caused by valley relaxation. In Sec-
tion V we discuss the interplay of valley and spin relax-
ations, before concluding in Section VI.

II. VALLEY DEPENDENT g-FACTOR IN

Si/SiGe QUANTUM DOTS

Bulk silicon has six eﬀective minima of the conduction
band named valleys. In a Si/SiGe quantum dot four of
the valleys are lifted higher in energy by the presence
of strain at the Si/SiGe interface and the two low en-
ergy valleys remain degenerate. The degeneracy of the
remaining two valleys is typically lifted by the conﬁning
potential in the z-direction [20, 21].

The Hamiltonian of a single electron conﬁned in a
Si/SiGe quantum dot in a magnetic ﬁeld in the z-
direction, and a magnetic ﬁeld gradient in the x-direction
is given by

H = H0 + Hz + HFM.

Here, H0 is the Hamiltonian of the single electron con-
ﬁned in a Si/SiGe quantum dot,

operator, and m∗
z the longitudinal electron mass (in the
direction perpendicular to the Si/SiGe quantum well).
Furthermore, m∗
is the transverse electron mass (in
the plane of Si/SiGe quantum well) and V (x)V (y)V (z)
are conﬁning potentials in the x, y, z directions, respec-
tively. The conﬁning potentials in the x-direction and
y-direction originate from the electrostatic conﬁnement
and are modeled with a harmonic oscillator potential
V (x) = m∗
0 y2/2. The potential
in the z-direction comes from the Si/SiGe quantum well
and is modeled as a ﬁnite square well potential. Hz is

ton, B0 is the total magnetic ﬁeld (in the z-direction) and

thermore, HFM is the Hamiltonian describing the stray
ﬁeld in the x-direction coming from the ferromagnet

HFM = gµBB(x)Sx,

and B(x) is the x component of the magnetic ﬁeld coming
from the ferromagnet B(x) = B0

dot, where m∗
t is the transverse eﬀective electron mass
and ωx
0 is the conﬁning potential in the x-direction. An
in-plane magnetic ﬁeld gradient B(x) modiﬁes the Zee-
man energy [22]. In our case the in-plane magnetic ﬁeld
gradient is caused by the ferromagnet embedded on top
of the quantum dot (Fig. 1). Neglecting the gradient in
the z-direction is a good approximation when the total
magnetic ﬁeld (directed along z) is much larger than the
z component of the stray ﬁeld.

Proceeding similar to [22], energy levels of H0 + Hz are

obtained as

E = En ± Ez/2.

(5)

Here, En is the conﬁnement energy and Ez = gµBB0 is
the electron Zeeman energy. A plus sign in Eq. (5) stands
for a spin-up state |↑(cid:105) and a minus sign for a spin-down
state |↓(cid:105).

The ﬁrst order energy correction coming from HFM
is zero because of the even parity of the ground state
wavefunction of the linear harmonic oscillator (LHO) and
odd parity of HFM. The second order energy correction
coming from the magnetic ﬁeld gradient term HFM =

Here, z0 is the position of the SiGe interface, the miscut is
usually between 0◦ ≤ θ ≤ 2◦, so it is safe to approximate
tan(θ) ≈ sin(θ) ≈ θ. Furthermore, vv is the valley cou-
pling strength. We have further assumed for simplicity
that the miscut occurs in the x-direction, and therefore
the valley coupling operator Eq. (14) does not depend
on the y component.

As the wavefunction is closest to the top interface only
one delta function potential is present in the theory. It
should be noted that the atomistic details of the valley
splitting are included via the valley coupling potential
Eq. (14) and therefore the periodic parts of the Bloch
wavefunctions do not play a role in our calculations and
can be omitted. Treating valley coupling as a perturba-
tion the general formula for matrix elements of the valley

Assuming that the wavefunctions Ψn are those of the
LHO the diagonal elements of the valley coupling opera-
tor Eq. (14) have the following form

(cid:104)n, v|Vv(r)|n, v(cid:105) = vvξ2(z0),

(16)

where n is the orbital quantum number corresponding to
the wavefunction in the x-direction, v is the valley quan-
tum number, ξ(z0) is the ground state electron wave-
function in the z-direction and z0 is the position of the
Si/SiGe interface. Due to the fact that the conﬁnement
in the z-directions comes from a sharp Si/SiGe interface,
the orbital level spacing in the z-direction is large, so we
assume that the system is always in the ground state in
the z-direction. The oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements of the
lowest two orbital states of the valley coupling operator
Eq. (14) have the following form

should be noted that due to valley-orbit mixing the orbital
quantum numbers n = 0, 1 and valley quantum numbers v =
±1 are not good quantum numbers anymore.

In the presence of valley-orbit mixing the orbital split-
ting ∆v,¯v is valley dependent [25, 26]. This yields a valley
dependent energy correction due to the slanting magnetic
ﬁeld Eq. (10), and therefore a correction to the electron
g-factor which depends on the valley state,

Valley-orbit mixing ∆v−∆¯v (cid:54)= 0 occurs due to miscuts

(Fig. 3). In Fig. 3 (a) we see that for θ ≈ 0.2◦ the aver-
age diﬀerence of valley dependent g-factors goes to zero
due to the fact that for this particular value of the ef-
fective tilt angle ∆v ≈ ∆¯v. Recent experimental studies
[24] yield an absolute average diﬀerence of valley g-factors
of |∆g/¯g| = 1.5 · 10−4 and predict an absolute average
diﬀerence of g-factors of |∆g/¯g| = 3· 10−5, given the sin-

|∆g/¯g| = 3 · 10−5 corresponds to the values θ ≈ 0.15◦ or

ing. As seen in Section II, the g-factors corresponding
to diﬀerent valleys only diﬀer by ≈ 10−3 relative to their
values, so throughout this Section it is safe to assume
that gv = g¯v = g = 2.
If the valley and orbit degree
of freedom mix (due to, e.g., Si/SiGe interface miscut)
the orbital level spacing ∆v,¯v, and therefore the Rabi

quencies as a function of the eﬀective tilt angle θ (Fig. 5).
A 50% absolute average diﬀerence of valley Rabi frequen-
cies has been measured in a recent experimental study
[24]. In our case the maximum ∆Ω/ ¯Ω = 25%, which cor-

(see Fig. 5). The discrepancy between our theory and the
experiment may be due the fact that the product of val-
ley coupling strength and the square of the wavefunction
at the position of the Si/SiGe interface vvξ2(z0), is a free
parameter. vv depends on the abundance of Ge x in the
Si/SixGe1−x quantum well and can be estimated from
tight binding theories [29]. On the other hand, ξ2(z0)
depends on the thickness of the Si layer and the exact
type of the conﬁnement in the Si/SiGe quantum well.

IV. MODELING THE DECOHERENCE

We model a situation in which an electron spin is con-
ﬁned in a Si/SiGe quantum dot with a ferromagnet em-
bedded on top of the quantum dot [22], inducing a stray
magnetic ﬁeld as shown in Fig. 1. All-electrical two-axis
control of single electron spin states is achieved by oscil-
lating the electron in real space with microwave bursts
[22, 30] (Fig. 1). As the electron oscillates in real space
it experiences a periodic, time-dependent, magnetic ﬁeld.
The free evolution of the electron spin is described by

the following Hamiltonian

the height of the Si quantum well is z0 = 12 nm.

Microwave induced oscillations of the electron in real
space, combined with the stray ﬁeld of the ferromag-
net, alter the state of the electron spin, while leaving
the valley degree of freedom unchanged. Coupling to the
microwave ﬁeld is described by

Rabi frequency and δE = (gv − g¯v)µBBz is the diﬀerence

The goal of our study is to model the inﬂuence of valley
relaxation on electron spin coherence. An electron is ini-

tialized in the |↓(cid:105) state with valley injection probabilities
P 0
v = 0.7, P 0
¯v = 0.3. We model a spin echo experiment,
where ﬁrst a π/2 pulse is applied, followed by a free (un-
driven) evolution of a duration t/2. Afterwards, a π pulse
is applied followed by another free evolution of a duration
t/2 and another π/2 pulse.

The valley relaxation is assumed to occur only during
the free evolution stage (as the duration of the free evolu-
tion stage t is much larger than the duration of π pulses),
and is modeled with a Lindblad equation

1

[H0, ρ] +

Γ(2L†ρL− LL†ρ− ρLL†) = Lρ.

˙ρ = − i

Here, L is the Lindblad superoperator. Furthermore, Γ is
the valley relaxation rate, and L† = |v(cid:105)(cid:104)¯v| and L = |¯v(cid:105)(cid:104)v|
are Lindblad inter-valley dissipation operators.

We use the echo envelope function as a measure of
the electron spin coherence. In order to be able to derive
the echo envelope function, instead of using the Lindblad
equation in the mentioned form Eq.
(23) we use the
Lindblad equation in superoperator form

ρ(t) = eLtρ(0).

(24)

Writing the Lindblad equation in the superoperator form
allows us to include a sequence of π/2 − π − π/2 pulses,
around the x axis, with inter-valley scattering occurring
in the free evolution stage in the following way
ρ(t) = Rx(π/2)eLt/2Rx(π)eLt/2Rx(π/2)ρ(0).

(25)

Here, Rx(β) rotates the spin ρ(t) about an angle β around
the x axis on the Bloch sphere. The π and π/2 pulses
are achieved by applying microwave pulses with a du-
ration π/Ωv and π/2Ωv, described by time evolution
operators Rx(π) = exp (−iHπ/¯hΩv) and Rx(π/2) =
exp (−iHπ/2¯hΩv), with H being given by Eq. (22).
Finally, we obtain the echo envelope function, the
probability that the electron changes spin to the |↑(cid:105) state
after a total time of a free evolution t, when being sub-
jected to a sequence of π/2 − π − π/2 pulses

(cid:88)

P↑ =

Tr(M j↑ ρ(t)).

(26)

j=v,¯v

Here the M j↑ are spin-up projection operators corre-
sponding to j-th valley state.

While the electron g-factor is valley dependent, the π
and π/2 pulses are still assumed perfect (see Fig. 7, black
line), and a valley relaxation event abruptly changes the
resonance condition for δE (see Eq.
(22)). After the
initial perfect π/2 pulse, in one half of the cases of inter-
valley relaxation from |v(cid:105) to |¯v(cid:105) the electron spin is in
|↑(cid:105) state. This is why the increase of the probability P↑,
originating from valley relaxation, saturates at P 0
v /2 (see
Fig. 7, gray dashed line).

The red triangles in Fig. 7 represent the result of
our simulation when the g-factors are valley dependent
throughout the free evolution stage and the π and π/2
pulses are imperfect in one of the valleys due to valley
dependent g-factors and Rabi frequencies. After the im-
perfect initial π/2 pulse, the electron spin is not perpen-
dicular to the magnetic ﬁeld yielding rotations around
the quantization axis with a frequency proportional to
the Zeeman energy g¯vµB(Bz + BFM
)/h, where Bz is the
z
external magnetic ﬁeld and BFM

∼ 50 ps timescale, with the amplitude of the oscillations
being given by the valley dependent Rabi frequencies Ωv
and Ω¯v and g-factors gv and g¯v. Therefore, the prob-
ability P↑ is very sensitive to the duration of the free
evolution stage. Due to the fact that the results of a
recent experimental study [24] represent an average over
150-1000 experimental outcomes, our results (red trian-
gles and yellow discs, Fig. 7) represent an average over
1000 outcomes, randomly sampled from a 5 ns interval.
When we compare the increase in probability due to val-
ley relaxation (black line, Fig. 7) and the additional ef-
fect of imperfect π and π/2 pulses we see that imperfect
rotations provide an additional mechanism that further
increases P↑.

A recent experimental study [24] shows a fast initial in-
crease by 0.25 of the probability P↑. Our model explains
an initial increase of P↑ by a few % due to the averaging
of the amplitude of 1000 randomly selected data points
of the P↑ oscillations close to t = 0, occurring due to im-
perfect π and π/2 pulses alongside with rotations around
the z-axis in the free evolution stage. One possible ex-
planation for the remaining discrepancy between the ex-
perimental ﬁndings and theory may be the initialization
to the |↓(cid:105) state with a ≈ 0.79 ﬁdelity (yellow disks, Fig.
7).

the echo P↑ probability is caused by the interplay of
valley and spin relaxations (Fig. 8, green circles and
blue squares). The exponential function f (P 0
v , Γ, γ, t) =
¯v e−γt/2) describes the drop of co-
0.5(1+P 0
herence. In the |v(cid:105) state the drop of coherence is caused
by both spin and valley relaxation processes, while in the
|¯v(cid:105) valley the drop of coherence is caused by spin relax-
ation processes. By comparing the results for T1 = ∞
(black dashed dotted line, Fig. 8) and T1 = 1 ms (green
dashed line, Fig. 8), we see that the spin relaxation hap-
pening on T1 = 1 ms timescales is increasing the P↑ prob-
ability by only ∼ 0.01 on ∼ 200 µs timescales.
In Fig. 9 we assume imperfect π and π/2 pulses, with
the rotation operators Rx(π) = exp (−iHπ/¯hΩv) and
Rx(π/2) = exp (−iHπ/¯h2Ωv), where the H is given by
Eq. (22), and Ωv is the valley dependent Rabi frequency.
During the free evolution stages the electron spin pre-
cesses around the external magnetic ﬁeld. After the im-
perfect initial π/2 pulse, the electron spin is not perpen-
dicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, yielding rotations around
the quantization axis with a frequency proportional to
the Zeeman energy g¯vµB(Bz + BFM
)/h, where Bz is the
z
external magnetic ﬁeld and BFM
is the z-component of
the magnetic ﬁeld of the ferromagnet. For Bz = 0.75 T

given by the valley dependent Rabi frequencies Ωv and

the P↑ probability is very sensitive to the duration of
the free evolution stage. The relaxation time T1 = 1 ms

INTERPLAY BETWEEN VALLEY AND

SPIN RELAXATION

In Si quantum dots orbital relaxation happens on the
10−12−10−7 s time scale, spin relaxation on the 10−6−1 s
scale, and valley relaxation is somewhere between the two
values [31]. In order to include spin relaxation processes
we add an additional term to our Lindblad equation Eq.
(23),

γ(2σ+ρσ− − σ−σ+ρ − ρσ−σ+) = L(cid:48)ρ,

(27)
where L(cid:48) is the Lindblad superoperator. Other than the
terms introduced in Eq. (23), the newly introduced terms
are the spin relaxation rates γ and two new Lindblad dis-
sipation operators related to spin relaxation σ+ = |↑(cid:105)(cid:104)↓|
and σ− = |↓(cid:105)(cid:104)↑|.

Because we are again interested in obtaining the echo
envelope function as a measure of the coherence drop we
will start from a Lindblad equation in a superoperator
form

ρ(t) = eL(cid:48)tρ(0).

(28)

By repeating the procedure from Section IV (Eq. (25)
and Eq.
(26)), we obtain the echo envelope function
Fig. 8 (probability that the electron spin is measured
in the |↑(cid:105) state after a time t, when being subjected
to a sequence of perfect π/2 − π − π/2 pulses). When
the g-factor is valley dependent, the π pulses perfect
and electron spin relaxation is occurring the increase of

study.

By comparing experimental data points (blue circles)
with the result of our modeling (purple diamonds) we
conclude that the saturation value of the P↑ probability
P↑(t → ∞) ≈ 0.39 and the P↑ probability close to t = 0,
P↑(t = 0) ≈ 0.25 are all within the the values measured
in a recent experimental study [24] and that our model
yields the correct functional form of P↑ probability in-
crease.

relaxation is present, a novel decoherence mechanism ex-
ists, further limiting the coherence of the electron spin.
Furthermore, the control of the electron spin state on the
Bloch sphere is inﬂuenced by a valley dependent g-factor
and Rabi frequency. Our model gives a good qualita-
tive and quantitative description of recent experimental
studies. Further research on this topic will move towards
including the drop of coherence due to the presence of
nuclear spins.

VI. CONCLUSION

VII. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

To conclude, we have discussed the control of the elec-
tron spin inside a Si/SiGe quantum dot with a ferromag-
net embedded on top. The stray magnetic ﬁeld of the fer-
romagnet combined with Si/SiGe interference imperfec-
tions consequently leads to a valley dependent g-factor.
When a valley dependent g-factor, alongside with valley
