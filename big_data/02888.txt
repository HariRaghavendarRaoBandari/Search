The friction and diﬀusion coeﬃcients of rigid spherical colloidal particles dissolved in a ﬂuid are
determined from velocity and force autocorrelation functions by mesoscale hydrodynamic simula-
tions. Colloids with both slip and no-slip boundary conditions are considered, which are embedded
in ﬂuids modelled by multiparticle collision dynamics (MPC) with and without angular momentum
conservation. For no-slip boundary conditions, hydrodynamics yields the well-known Stokes law,
while for slip boundary conditions the lack of angular momentum conservation leads to a reduction
of the hydrodynamic friction coeﬃcient compared to the classical result. The colloid diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient is determined by integration of the velocity autocorrelation function, where the numerical
result at shorter times is combined with the theoretical hydrodynamic expression for longer times.
The suitability of this approach is conﬁrmed by simulations of sedimenting colloids.
In general,
we ﬁnd only minor deviations from the Stokes-Einstein relation, which even disappear for larger
colloids. Importantly, for colloids with slip boundary conditions, our simulation results contradict
the frequently assumed additivity of local and hydrodynamic diﬀusion coeﬃcients.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of colloids in solution is governed by hy-
drodynamic interactions, a fact which is very well estab-
lished [1–3]. Yet, a full account of the long-range nature
of the hydrodynamic interactions in computer simula-
tions of large systems of colloidal dispersions is still chal-
lenging. Recently developed mesoscale hydrodynamic
simulation approaches, such as the multiparticle colli-
sion dynamics (MPC) method [4–6], are very valuable
to study colloidal dispersions, with the strong length-
and time-scales separation between the colloid and ﬂuid
degrees of freedom. The particle-based MPC approach
has been shown to correctly reproduce the hydrodynamic
properties of embedded colloids or polymers [6, 7]. Vari-
ous approaches have been proposed for the embedding of
a spherical colloid into the MPC ﬂuid [8–11]. The corre-
sponding colloid-ﬂuid coupling governs the colloid’s ve-
locity or force autocorrelation function (VACF, FACF).
Here, two diﬀerent time regimes are typically identiﬁed:
a short-time regime of uncorrelated ﬂuid-particle motion
and local interactions, characterized by molecular chaos,
and a long-time regime with strong hydrodynamic corre-
lations. The ﬁrst regime is typically dominated by ballis-
tic ﬂuid-colloid collisions and is described by the Enskog
gas theory [10, 12, 13]; in a more general sense, we will
denote this regime as local regime. As a consequence,
the VACF decays exponentially for short times with a
characteristic time given by the ratio of the local friction

coeﬃcient and the colloid mass [9–11, 14, 15]. On longer
time scales, the VACF follows the prediction of hydrody-
namic theory (Navier-Stokes) and displays an algebraic
long-time tail [9–11, 14–17].

The separation between local and hydrodynamic time
scales aﬀects the frictional and consequently the diﬀusive
behavior of a colloid. Indeed, several studies suggest that
the total colloid diﬀusivity is a sum of a hydrodynamic
and local diﬀusion coeﬃcient [8, 10, 18]. However, a de-
tailed and decisive study of the relevance of the various
contributions for a colloid embedded in a MPC ﬂuid is
still missing.

The standard, most often applied implementation of
MPC [5, 6] does not conserve angular momentum, which
can give rise to unphysical torques [19], and, in case of
(partial) slip boundaries, yields ﬂow ﬁelds, which deviate
from those theoretically predicted [20]. In Ref. [20], it has
been found in particular that the lack of angular momen-
tum conservation combined with (partial) slip boundary
conditions leads to a reduction of the friction coeﬃcient
compared to that of a ﬂuid with angular momentum con-
servation. This result is surprising, especially since it
was not reported before in studies where the friction of
colloids with slip boundary conditions was determined
[8, 10, 18]. The reason may lie in the rather involved
interpretation of simulated friction coeﬃcients. As men-
tioned above, the friction measured in MPC simulations
is not only determined by hydrodynamics, but also by
short-time local processes. Additionally, periodic bound-
ary conditions, typically employed in simulations, aﬀect
the frictional behavior. The importance of the various
contributions has been addressed before [8, 10, 18], but
the validity of Stokes’ law for systems with slip boundary
conditions has been presumed. In the light of the mod-
iﬁed Stokes law [20], the frictional behavior needs to be

reconsidered to correctly identify the hydrodynamic and
local contributions.

In this paper, we generalize the steady-state consid-
erations for the friction coeﬃcient of Ref. [20] and de-
termine its full frequency dependence. We verify the
reduction of the hydrodynamic friction of non-angular-
momentum-conserving MPC methods compared to an-
gular momentum conserving ones by measuring force as
well as velocity autocorrelation functions. Moreover, the
relative contributions of local and hydrodynamic friction
are determined by the force autocorrelation function. We
determine the diﬀusion and friction coeﬃcients for col-
loids of diﬀerent radii by integration of the autocorrela-
tion function (Green-Kubo) and complement the analysis
by sedimentation studies. This enables us to examine the
additivity of various contributions to the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient. We ﬁnd that the hydrodynamic frictional contribu-
tion dominates by far for slip as well as no-slip boundary
conditions. The local friction only yields a small addi-
tional contribution for small colloid radii. For colloids
with no-slip boundaries, the sum of the hydrodynamic
and local diﬀusion coeﬃcient yields a good approxima-
tion for the total diﬀusion coeﬃcient. However, for slip
boundary conditions this additivity does not apply.

The paper is structured as follows.

In section II we
present the multiparticle collision dynamics method and
the colloid-solvent coupling. The relevant ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorems for Brownian motion as well as hy-
drodynamic and local friction are brieﬂy discussed in sec-
tion III. Simulation results are presented in section IV;
section V summarizes our ﬁndings. Finally, we include
appendixes, in which analytical formula are derived for
hydrodynamic and Enskog friction, the latter being a spe-
cial case of local friction (see appendix A and B, respec-
tively).

II. MULTIPARTICLE COLLISION DYNAMICS

A. Algorithm

The MPC solvent is modeled by N point particles with
mass m, positions ri, and velocities vi (i = 1,··· , N ),
contained in a cubic simulation box with periodic bound-
ary conditions. The discrete time dynamics consists of
a streaming step, for the collision-time interval h, and
a subsequent instantaneous collision.
In the ballistic
streaming step, the particle positions are updated via

ri(t + h) = ri(t) + hvi(t).

(1)

In the collision step, the simulation box is partitioned
into cubic collision cells of length a, in which stochas-
tic multiparticle collisions are performed. For these colli-
sions, diﬀerent approaches have been developed [4, 6, 21–
23]. In the stochastic-rotation-dynamics version (MPC-
SRD) [4–6], the relative velocity of each particle, with
respect to the center-of-mass velocity of the cell, is ro-
tated by a ﬁxed angle α around a randomly oriented axis,

independent for each cell, which yields the velocities

vi(t + h) = vcm(t) + R(α)(vi(t) − vcm(t)).

Here, vi(t) and vi(t+h) are the velocities before and after
the collision, respectively. R(α) is the rotation matrix,

vcm =

Nc Xj∈cell

is the center-of-mass velocity, and Nc the total number of
particles in the cell of particle i. To maintain Galilean in-
variance, a random shift of the collision grid is performed
in every collision step [24, 25]. The update in Eq. (2)
conserves energy and momentum. A canonical ensemble
is achieved by a suitable thermostat [26, 27]. Through-
out this paper, we apply the local Maxwell-Boltzmann-
scaling (MBS) thermostat, where the relative particle ve-
locities in each cell are scaled by a factor determined from
the Gamma distribution of cell kinetic energies [27, 28].
On length scales larger than a collision cell, the MPC
ﬂuid obeys the Navier-Stokes equations [4, 17, 29]. How-
ever,
in contrast to real ﬂuids, the stress tensor of
the above MPC-SRD implementation is non-symmetric,
since angular momentum is not conserved during the col-
lision step [20, 30, 31]. A symmetric stress tensor follows
by an extension of Eq. (2), which ensures angular mo-
mentum conservation on a cell level [32]. The velocity
update then reads as [23, 32]

vi(t + h) = vcm + R(α)vi,c

− ri,c ×hmI −1 Xj∈cell

{rj,c × (vj,c − R(α)vj,c)}i,
(4)
where ri,c = ri − rcm is the particle position relative
to their center-of-mass rcm of a cell, I is the moment-
of-inertia tensor of the particles in the center-of-mass
It is not neces-
reference frame, and vi,c = vi − vcm.
sary that the update in Eq. (4) conserves energy, since
we apply the MBS-thermostat subsequently. MPC-SRD
with and without angular momentum conservation are
referred to as MPC-SRD+a and MPC-SRD-a, respec-
tively. The stress tensor of the MPC ﬂuid is of the general
form [23]

σ = −p E + η1∇vT + η2(∇vT )T + η3(∇ · v) E,

(5)

where p(r, t) is the pressure ﬁeld, v(r, t) is the velocity
ﬁeld, η1, η2, and η3 are the viscosity parameters, and
E is the unit matrix. The stress tensor of MPC-SRD-
a is asymmetric with η1 = ηk, η2 = η = ηc + ηk, and
η3 = −2η1/3 [23, 31], where η is the shear viscosity with
its kinetic ηk and collisional ηc contribution. In case of
MPC-SRD+a, the stress tensor is symmetric and η1 =
η2 = η, η3 = −2η/3 + ηV , where ηV = (η1 + η2 + 3η3)/3 is
the bulk viscosity [23]. Note that the viscosities ηk and ηc
depend on the presence or absence of angular momentum
conservation [32], but ηV is equal for MPC-SRD-a and
MPC-SRD+a, since the bulk viscosity of MPC-SRD+a
is determined by the collisional viscosity of MPC-SRD-a
[23].

B. Colloid-solvent coupling

has to be used. At third, the colloid’s translational and
rotational velocities are updated via

3

A spherical colloid of radius R, mass M , velocity u,
and angular velocity Ω can be coupled to the solvent by
elastic collisions during the streaming step [9, 10]. Each
of these collisions transfers a linear momentum Ji, while
conserving the total linear and angular momentum as
well as energy. Denoting post-collisional quantities by a
prime, we may write [10, 33]

v′
i = vi − Ji/m,
u′ = u + Ji/M,
Ω′ = Ω + R(ni × Ji)/I,

(6)
(7)
(8)

which ensures conservation of linear and angular momen-
tum for every choice of Ji. Here, vi is the velocity of the
colliding MPC particle, I = χM R2 = (2/5)M R2 is the
colloid’s moment of inertia, and ni = (ri− C)/|ri− C| is
the unit vector between the particle position ri and the
colloid center C. We deﬁne the relative velocity

¯vi = vi − u − Ω × Rni

(9)

between the MPC particle and the closest point on the
colloid surface. By using energy conservation, we obtain
two solutions for Ji, which we distinguish by the param-
eter Γ ∈ {0, 1} [10, 33], hence,

Ji = 2µ¯vi,n + 2(1 − Γ)µ

(10)

Here, µ = mM/(m + M ) is the reduced mass and the
indices n and t indicate the normal and tangential com-
ponents, i.e., ¯vi,n = ninT
i )¯vi. For
M ≫ m, the choice Γ = 1 corresponds to a specular re-
ﬂection, and hence slip boundary conditions, while Γ = 0
corresponds to bouncing-back and thus no-slip boundary
conditions. As a generalization, by the choice Γ ∈ (0, 1)
partial slip can be modeled [10, 34].
The MPC ﬂuid-colloid collisions are performed in a
coarse-grained manner. At ﬁrst, the solvent particles as
well as the colloid move ballistically according to Eq. (1)
and

C(t + h) = C(t) + hu(t),

(11)

respectively. At second, each solvent particle i with
|ri(t + h) − C(t + h)|2 < R2 is moved back in time by
(h − hi), where hi is deﬁned by |ri(t) − C(t) + hi(vi −
u)|2 = R2. Each of those particles will then collide with
a virtual colloid at position C(t) + hiu(t), with veloc-
ity u(t) and angular velocity Ω(t), transfer momentum
Ji and subsequently move with its corrected velocity v′
i
for the time (h − hi). Hence, the streaming step Eq. (1)
of a MPC particle interacting with a colloid is changed
and consists of two parts, streaming before—with veloc-
ity vi—and after—with velocity v′
i—the collision. Ad-
ditionally, in the MPC collision Eq. (2), the velocity v′

In the case of no-slip boundaries, additionally MPC
ghost particles [35] are randomly distributed inside the
colloid at each time step, which introduces an additional
colloid-solvent interaction in the MPC collision step, and
reduces the amount of slip. After each MPC collision
step, the colloid velocities are updated via

tions, see Refs. [10, 34]

Since the MPC algorithm is highly parallel, we execute
simulations on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for a
high performance gain [36].

III. BROWNIAN MOTION

A. Fluctuation dissipation relations

The equations of motion of a colloidal Brownian parti-
cle of mass M and velocity u(t) in a viscous ﬂuid, expe-
riencing a retarded friction force together with a random
force K(t), are given by

M

dt′ γ(t − t′)u(t′) + K(t).

(16)

The friction kernel γ(t) obeys γ(t) = 0 ∀ t < 0 due to
causality, but is not speciﬁed beyond that at this stage.
By multiplying Eq. (16) by u(0), averaging over the ran-
dom forces, and assuming hK(t) · u(0)i = 0, we ﬁnd the
governing equation

for the velocity autocorrelation function

Cu(t) =

(18)

To solve Eq. (17), we perform a Laplace transformation
0 dt e−ztf (t). The resulting algebraic

(19)

with the initial condition Cu(0) = kBT /M , i.e., equipar-
tition of energy, where z is the Laplace variable, kB
is Boltzmann’s constant, and T the temperature. For
u(t), the correlation function ˜Cu(z)
Cu(−t) = Cu(t) = C ∗
is related with the Fourier transform

ˆCu(ω) =Z ∞

dt eiωtCu(t)

(20)

of Cu(t) according to ˆCu(ω) = 2Re{ ˜Cu(z = −iω)}. We
will work further in Fourier space for convenience. The
velocity autocorrelation function is then given by

ˆCu(ω) = 2Re(cid:26)

kBT

ˆγ(ω) − iωM(cid:27) .

(21)

The explicit expression for ˆγ(ω) is provided in App. A 1.
Similarly, we can determine the force autocorrelation

function of the random forces (FACF)

CK(t) =

1
3hK(t) · K(0)i.

(22)

In order to determine CK (t), we establish a relation be-
tween h ˆu(ω1) · ˆu∗(ω2)i and h ˆK(ω1) · ˆK ∗(ω2)i by Fourier
transforming Eq. (16). This yields the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation relation

ˆCK (ω) = 2kBT Re{ˆγ(ω)}.

(23)

The time integral of the force autocorrelation function
is related with the zero-frequency friction coeﬃcient ac-
cording to

Z ∞

dt CK(t) =

ˆCK(ω = 0) = kBT ˆγ(ω = 0).

(24)

On the other hand, the time integral of the velocity auto-
correlation function, which is by deﬁnition the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient D, yields

D =Z ∞

dt Cu(t) =

1
2

ˆCu(ω = 0) =

kBT

ˆγ(ω = 0)

,

(25)

which is known as Einstein-Sutherland relation.

Similarly, the equation of motion for the rotational mo-

tion is

I

dΩ
dt

= −Z t

0

dt′ ξ(t − t′)Ω(t′) + N (t),

(26)

where I is the moment of inertia, Ω is the angular veloc-
ity, ξ(t) is the rotational friction, and N is the random
torque. Since this equation is mathematically equivalent
to Eq. (16), all results for the translational motion apply
here as well. In particular, Eqs. (17)-(25) hold, when M
is replaced by I, u by Ω, γ by ξ, K by N , and D by
DR, with the rotational diﬀusion coeﬃcient DR.

On long time scales, the MPC solvent can be described
by hydrodynamics, whereas on short time scales the
molecular chaos assumption applies [17, 38]. For the
latter, the relevant time range depends on the collision
time h. We will denote the resulting friction coeﬃcients
on these time scales as hydrodynamic friction γh and
local friction γl.
In our simulations, we determine the
friction coeﬃcients via velocity and force autocorrelation
functions. Theoretical predictions for Cu(t) and CK (t)
can be found by numerical Fourier transformation of
Eqs. (21) and (23), with ˆγ(ω) given in App. A 1.
In an analogous manner, CΩ(t) and CN (t) are deter-
mined by Fourier transformation with ˆξ(ω) of App. A 2.

Hydrodynamic friction The classical result for the fre-
quency dependent hydrodynamic friction ˆγ(ω) (Ref. [39])
assumes local angular momentum conservation for the
solvent, i.e., η1 = η2 in Eq. (5). The respective deriva-
tion of the friction coeﬃcients for translational and ro-
tational motion for the case η1 6= η2, which applies for
MPC-SRD-a, is presented in App. A 1. In any case, on
long time scales, where the MPC ﬂuid is described by
hydrodynamics, the correlation function Cu(t) exhibits
the well-known algebraic long-time tail [11, 16, 38]

Cu(t) t→∞−−−→

2kBT

3ρ0 (cid:18)4π

η2

ρ0|t|(cid:19)−3/2

.

(27)

Here, ρ0 is the equilibrium mass density. For a no-slip
colloid, γh is unaﬀected by angular momentum conserva-
tion and reads [20]

γh = 6πηR.

(28)

In contrast, for a colloid with a slip boundary condition,
the classical result γh = 4πη2R is modiﬁed, and the fric-
tion coeﬃcient becomes

γh = 6πη2R

η1 + η2
η1 + 2η2

(29)

for η1 6= η2 (cf. Ref. [20] and Eq. (A24)). For MPC-SRD-
a, Eq. (29) reduces to γh ≈ 4πηR for ηc ≪ ηk, and to
γh ≈ 3πηR in the typical case ηc ≫ ηk. In contrast, the
stress tensor is symmetric for MPC-SRD+a, i.e., η1 = η2,
and the classical result γh = 4πηR is recovered. The
zero-frequency limit of the rotational friction coeﬃcient
is

ξh = (1 − Γ)8πηR3.

(30)

Note that for slip colloids Γ = 1 so that no hydrodynamic
drag torque opposes the colloid’s rotation.

Local friction At short times, the molecular chaos as-
sumption applies for the MPC ﬂuid [17, 38], which yields
CK(t) = 0 ∀t > 0. In the time continuum this implies

that CK (t) is proportional to a delta distribution and
therefore ˆCK (ω) = ˆCK(ω = 0). By means of Eq. (23),
we ﬁnd ˆγ(ω) = ˆγ(ω = 0) ≡ γl and the typical Langevin
equation is obtained, which yields

Cu(t) = Cu(0) exp (−γlt/M ).

(31)

We expect to observe this behavior in MPC simulations
only approximately and for very short times. Since MPC
is a discrete-time random process and CK(t) = 0 ∀t > 0,
Eq. (24) yields

γl =

h

2kBT

CK (0).

(32)

This equation provides a simple relation to measure the
local friction coeﬃcient γl [40].

In order to ﬁnd an analytical expression for γl, we have
to evaluate various contributions to CK(0). The random
force K = K k + K c comprises the contributions K k due
to collisions with MPC particles in the streaming step
and K c due to the change of the ghost-particle momenta
during the collision step [40]. Hence, the autocorrelation
functions hK k · K ki and hK c · K ci, as well as the cross-
correlation function hK k · K ci contribute to CK(0). We
denote the friction by the correlation hK k·K ki as Enskog
friction γE. When no ghost particles are present, as is the
case for slip boundary conditions, K c = 0 and γl = γE.
A derivation for γE is presented in App. B, which yields
the result previously established in Ref. [10]

γE =

8

3p2πkBT µnR2 1 + (2 − Γ)χM/µ

1 + χM/µ

.

(33)

Here, n = ρ0/m is the particle density. We could not
ﬁnd analytical expressions for hK c · K ci and hK c · K ki.
Therefore, we measure γl according to Eq. (32) in pres-
ence of ghost particles.

For the rotational motion, the treatment is analogous.

The local and Enskog friction are (cf. App. B)

IV. SIMULATIONS

MPC simulations are performed with the rotation an-
gle α = 130◦ and the mean number of particles per colli-
sion cell hNci = 10, which corresponds to the equilibrium
density ρ0 = hNci m/a3. We focus on the liquid-like
regime of the MPC ﬂuid [38] by choosing the collision
time as h/pma2/(kBT ) = 0.05, which corresponds to

a Schmidt number of approximately 100. We employ
a cubic simulation box of length L/a = 100 with peri-
odic boundary conditions if not otherwise stated. Since

ties ηk and ηc for our applied methods (MPC-SRD±a)
and parameters. Measuring viscosities by nonequilib-
rium simulations using shear ﬂow [23, 28, 41] yields
η = 7.45√mkBT /a2 and ηV = 5.40√mkBT /a2 for
MPC-SRD+a, as well as ηk = 0.3√mkBT /a2 and ηc =

sume a neutrally buoyant colloid, i.e., M = (4π/3)ρ0R3.

colloid in the MPC solvent. For the force autocorrelation
function, we ﬁx the colloid center at the origin of the
reference frame by means of a constraining force F C (t).
The random force follows then as K(t) = −F C (t) [8,
40], while F C is calculated as momentum transfer per
time step h, with contributions due to collisions of MPC
particles in the streaming step and due to the change of
the ghost particles’ momenta during the collision step.

Figure 1 shows two typical force autocorrelation func-
tions.
In case of the slip colloid, the FACF at t = 0
matches the expected Enskog value 2kBT γE/h (cf. Eq.
(32) or App. B) very well. However, for the no-slip col-
loid, CK(0) is only captured by Enskog theory if ghost
particles are neglected, as can be expected for non-zero
correlations hK c · K ci. Taking into account the momen-
tum transfer due to ghost particles, we obtain a signif-
icantly larger value of CK (0), and hence, of the local

friction coeﬃcient.

Within the molecular chaos assumption, the FACF is
zero for all t > 0, which implies an exponentially decay-
ing VACF. In fact, in our MPC simulation, the FACF
decreases substantially after one time step, but instead
of zero, it assumes about 10% of its initial value for the
parameters of Fig. 1 (a). This explains the approxi-
mate exponential decay of the VACF for the ﬁrst few
time steps, as reported in Refs. [8, 10, 15, 18]. As Fig.
1 shows, the FACF is rather noisy, and an average over
many independent realizations is required to achieve a
smooth curve on long time scales.

The corresponding velocity autocorrelation functions
are much smoother, as revealed by Fig. 2. At t = 0,
Cu(t = 0) = kBT /M , as expected. For short times t > 0,
the simulation data slightly exceed the theoretical pre-
diction until the hydrodynamic regime is reached. For
longer times, we observe the long-time tail (cf. Eq. (27).
The oscillations visible in Fig. 2 for long times origi-
nate from sound modes and are a consequence of the
ﬁnite compressibility of the MPC ﬂuid combined with
the periodic boundary conditions [17]. This also leads to
an exponential decay of the correlation function on long
time scales [17]. We determine the VACF for colloids of
radii R/a = 1, 2, . . . , 8, and ﬁnd that for no-slip boundary
conditions the VACF follows the hydrodynamic predic-
tion well for radii R > 2a, while for slip colloids, R ≥ 3a
is required.
A detailed analysis of the VACF at t = 0 shows a small
deviation from the equipartition value Cu(0) = kBT /M ,
which vanishes with increasing colloid size. For a slip
colloid of radius R = 3a in a MPC-SRD+a ﬂuid, Cu(0)
is just 1% larger than the expected value, while for no-slip

η = 7.45√mkBT /a2. The box sizes are L = 100a (a) and
L = 60a (b), respectively. The inset in (a) shows the ﬁrst few

torque autocorrelation function on a linear scale. The torque
autocorrelation function in (b) reaches its t−5/2 long-time tail
at t/pma2/(kBT ) & 102 which is not visible in the plotted
time domain. Since the theoretical hydrodynamic-torque au-
tocorrelation function (dashed, red) diverges for t → 0, both

noted as C s

colloids the theoretical value is exceeded by 5% for R =
2a and by 2% for R = 3a. Working with R/a ≥ 3, these
values are acceptable, and we do not see a broadened
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution due to ghost particles
as reported in Ref. [10]. A disregard of ghost particles, as
suggested in Ref [10], leads to strong deviations between
VACF obtained in simulations and from hydrodynamic
theory for t > 0 as shown by Fig. 2 (b). Hence, ghost
particles are essential to obtain a good representation of
no slip boundary conditions.

To elucidate the relevance of angular momentum
conservation on the VACF, we perform simulations
of a slip colloid in MPC-SRD+a with the collision

step h/pma2/(kBT ) = 0.05 and in MPC-SRD-a with
h/pma2/(kBT ) = 0.12, respectively. By this choice,
both ﬂuids possess approximately the same shear viscos-
ity η = 7.45√mkBT /a2. As Fig. 3 shows, the velocity
autocorrelation functions deviate from each other, but
both are well described by hydrodynamic theory with
the appropriate stress tensor. The colloid VACF for the
MPC-SRD-a ﬂuid is consistently larger than that for the
MPC-SRD+a ﬂuid, which corresponds to a reduced fric-
tion of the MPC-SRD-a ﬂuid (cf. Eq. (29)). This re-
conﬁrms the result of Ref.
[20] that the friction of slip
colloids is reduced for non-angular-momentum conserv-
ing MPC ﬂuids.

Finally, Fig. 4 displays simulation results for the
angular-velocity-autocorrelation function as well as the
torque-autocorrelation function for a no-slip colloid,
which both agree well with hydrodynamic theory. Similar
to the force autocorrelation, the torque autocorrelation
function is very noisy.

B. Diﬀusion coeﬃcient

As is well known, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of a particle
in a system with periodic boundary conditions is system-
size dependent [7, 18, 42–45]. In order to ﬁnd the asymp-
totic diﬀusion coeﬃcient for an inﬁnite system (L → ∞),
we integrate the simulation data for the VACF from t = 0
to t0 > 0 and subsequently integrate the theoretical cor-
relation function from t = t0 to t → ∞ [7, 11]. Hereby, t0
has been chosen such that hydrodynamic theory applies
for t > t0. This procedure is illustrated in Fig. 5, where

prised of the numerical results for L/a = 80 up to

t0 = 40pma2/(kBT ) and the theoretical expression fol-

lowing from Eq. (21) for longer times.

In this way, we determine the diﬀusion coeﬃcients of
slip and no-slip colloids for several radii. The results are
presented in Fig. 6. Evidently, the diﬀusion coeﬃcients
are in close agreement with the prediction by hydrody-
namics at large colloid radii. However, for small radii,
we observe certain deviations, which we attribute to the
eﬀect of local friction. In general, the simulation data are
by far closer to the hydrodynamic diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dh
than to the combination with the Enskog expression, i.e.,
Dh + DE, where Dh = kBT /γh and DE = kBT /γE.

In case of no-slip colloids, we have to compare Dh to

ﬂuid. The colloid radius is R/a = 6. The open circles corre-
spond to the plateau values of Fig. 5. The values indicated
by crosses (red) are obtained by sedimentation simulations.
The lines follow from Eq. (37), where we insert D = Dh + Dl
for the dashed orange line, D = Dh for the blue solid line,
and we substitute D by the value obtained from the integral
extrapolation approach of section IV B for the black dotted
line.

Dh + Dl, where Dl = kBT /γl accounts for local interac-
tions. Note that Dl is small compared to Dh, because
γl is very large. Our simulation results are about mid-
way in-between the predictions Dh and Dh + Dl. As a
consequence, for both, slip and no-slip colloids, hydrody-
namics dominates at large R and the simulation results
are well described by Dh.

C. Colloid sedimentation and diﬀusion coeﬃcient

We can extract ﬁnite-system-size diﬀusion coeﬃcients
DL by the plateau values in Fig.
5. Complemen-
tary, we perform simulations of sedimenting colloids by
constantly accelerating a colloid with the acceleration
g = 10−3kBT /(ma). At the same time, the ﬂuid ex-

periences the acceleration gf = −g/(ρ0L3/M − 1), such
that the center of mass of the total system remains at
rest. For the selected values, the Reynolds number is
approximately 0.1. When a steady state velocity u is
reached, we obtain the ﬁnite-system-size friction coef-
ﬁcient as γL = M g/u, and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient as
DL = kBT /γL (Einstein-Sutherland relation).

For a hydrodynamic solvent, a relation between DL
and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of an inﬁnite system D has
been provided in Ref. [43] to ﬁrst order in R/L,

DL = D −

2.837kBT

6πηL

.

(37)

Since this expression is derived for point particles, the
ﬁnite-size correction should hold for both slip and no-
slip colloids. We consider colloids of radius R/a = 6,
for which hydrodynamics should dominate in our simu-
lations, and thus, Eq. (37) should apply.
Results for DL are presented in Fig. 7 together with the
theoretical expression Eq. (37) for various systems sizes
L. Our values obtained by sedimentation are only about
2% higher than those determined via the VACF, which is
an excellent agreement taking the accuracy of our meth-
ods into account.

We return to the question whether diﬀusivity is addi-
tive, i.e., D = Dh + Dl. According to the sedimentation
data for no-slip colloids, D = Dh + Dl seems to be a
decent approximation, with an error of about 2%. For
slip colloids, however, the prediction D = Dh + Dl ex-
ceeds the measured values by about 30%. Hence, for slip
colloids the diﬀusivities are not additive in MPC.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have determined velocity and force autocorrelation
functions of rigid spherical colloids dispersed in a MPC
ﬂuid. Both, slip and no-slip boundary conditions on the
colloid surface have been considered. For slip boundary
conditions, MPC ﬂuids with (MPC-SRD+a) and with-
out (MPC-SRD-a) angular-momentum conservation have
been employed. In contrast, for no-slip boundary condi-
tions only a MPC-SRD+a ﬂuid has been utilized, be-
cause the coupling between the colloidal rotational de-
grees of freedom and the ﬂuid requires a proper angu-
lar momentum transfer. We have veriﬁed the reduction
of hydrodynamic friction of colloids with slip boundary
conditions in a MPC-SRD-a ﬂuid compared to the re-
spective Stokes law. As derived in Ref. [20], the friction
coeﬃcient of such a colloid is given by an expression (Eq.
(A24)), which reduces to γh ≈ 3πηR for ηc ≫ ηk, in con-
trast to the classical result γh = 4πηR for an angular-
momentum-conserving ﬂuid. We like to stress that dif-
ferences in the transport coeﬃcients of angular- and non-
angular-momentum-conserving ﬂuids are a general prob-
lem of ﬂuid simulations and not particular to MPC.

By measuring correlation functions for no-slip colloids,
we found that ghost ﬂuid particles inside the colloid are

9

essential for a proper hydrodynamic colloid-solvent cou-
pling. We did not observe a broadening of the Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution due to ghost particles, as dis-
cussed in Ref. [10], i.e., a notably deviation of Cu(0) from
kBT /M . Hence, ghost particles are essential to properly
describe the dynamics of colloids with no-slip boundary
conditions.

In addition, we have extracted diﬀusion coeﬃcients
from correlation functions and indirectly via colloid sed-
imentation. Most importantly, our simulations clearly
show that the colloid diﬀusion coeﬃcient is dominated
by hydrodynamics in the parameter regime where MPC
is liquid-like, i.e., for ηc ≫ ηk. Local friction yields only a
minor contribution to the overall diﬀusion coeﬃcient, and
disappears with increasing colloid radius. Thereby, for
no-slip colloids, the sum of the local and hydrodynamic
diﬀusion coeﬃcients is an acceptable approximation for
the total diﬀusivity. This sum slightly overestimates the
simulation result, but the deviation disappears with in-
creasing colloid radius, and the Stokes-Einstein relation
is satisﬁed. We have conﬁrmed the result for the time

steps h/pma2/(kBT ) = 0.1, 0.02. Thereby, all consid-

ered collision-time steps are well within the liquid regime
of MPC-SRD [38]. However, for colloids with slip bound-
ary conditions, the total diﬀusion coeﬃcient is not given
by the sum of the hydrodynamic and local diﬀusion co-
eﬃcients, regardless of angular-momentum conservation.
The combination of both signiﬁcantly overestimates the
diﬀusivity. As for other colloids, the simulation result is
well described by the hydrodynamic diﬀusivity.

In the literature, colloids with slip boundary conditions
have also been modeled by ﬁnite-range (steep) central po-
tentials between colloids and MPC ﬂuid particles [8, 18].
For inﬁnitely steep interaction potentials, this approach
should be equivalent to the method of specular reﬂec-
tion applied in this paper. For a ﬁnite interaction range,
the interpretation of simulation results is less straight-
forward, since an eﬀective hydrodynamic radius has to
be introduced as a ﬁt parameter. But also in this case,
we expect the non-additivity of diﬀusion coeﬃcients to
prevail.

Our studies clearly underline the dominance of hydro-
dynamic interactions in colloid diﬀusion. Even for mod-
erately large colloids, hydrodynamics dominates already.
The necessity of a local friction contribution in previous
studies for colloids with slip boundary conditions may
partially originate from an overestimation of the hydro-
dynamic friction coeﬃcient by assuming the applicability
of the Stokes law. The actual coeﬃcient is up to a factor
of 3/4 smaller, and hence the diﬀusion coeﬃcient corre-
spondingly larger.

1. Translational friction

In the following, we derive expressions for the friction
coeﬃcient ˆγ(ω) of a spherical colloid with slip or no-
slip boundary conditions moving with velocity u(t) =
u(t)(0, 0, 1)T in a ﬂuid, with a stress tensor speciﬁed by
Eq. (5). Thereby, we follow the derivation of Ref.

i.e., c2 = ∂p/∂ρ, where c is either the adiabatic or isother-
mal sound velocity. MPC obeys the ideal-gas equation
of state [41], and in simulations we apply the MBS-

thermostat, hence c = pkBT /m. The pressure can be

For a rotating sphere with no-slip boundary conditions
ˆv(r = R) = ˆΩ× r. Since the rotational motion of the no-
slip colloid should not excite longitudinal sound modes,
we can restrict ourselves to an incompressible description
of the ﬂuid [51]. The linearized incompressible Navier-
Stokes equation can be solved by the Ansatz

ˆv = ∇ × A,

(A27)

with A = f (r) ˆΩ [52]. The torque is found by ˆT =

Appendix B: Enskog friction

For short times, the force autocorrelation function of
a colloid is determined by uncorrelated collisions with
ﬂuid particles (molecular chaos). Hence, during the ﬁrst
streaming and collision step, no hydrodynamic correla-
tions build up. (We will neglect ghost particles for the
following considerations.) Since force is change of mo-
mentum per time, the force K on the colloid during a
streaming step is

K =

1
h

N

Xk=1

Jk.

(B1)

(A25)

Hence, the force-autocorrelation function at time t = 0
is

hK(0)2i =

within the molecular-chaos assumption. Instead of sum-
ming over particles, we can integrate the respective dis-
tribution over the colloid surface. Consider an inﬁnites-
imal surface element of the spherical colloid of area
dS = R2 sin θdθdϕ. During a time step, solvent parti-
cles with a relative velocity

¯v = v − u − Ω × Rn,

(B3)

which is negative in the normal direction, i.e., ¯v · n =
¯vn < 0, collide with the colloid if they are located in
the volume element dV = −¯vnhdS. With the average
particle density n = N/V , we ﬁnd for the number dN of
colliding particles per surface element dS

dN = −n¯vnhdS

(B4)

and consequently for the force autocorrelation function

hK(0)2i =

1

h2 Z dS(cid:28) dN

dS

J 2(cid:29) .

(B5)

The dependence of J on ¯v is speciﬁed in Eq.(10), and
the average is deﬁned as

h. . .i =Z 0

−∞

d¯vnZ ∞

−∞

d¯vθZ ∞

−∞

d¯vϕPn(¯vn)Pt(¯vθ)Pt(¯vϕ) . . . ,

(B6)

where ¯vθ and ¯vϕ are the components of the tangential
velocity ¯vt in θ and ϕ direction. The probability distri-
bution functions Pn and Pt are Gaussian, since v, u, and
Ω are Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed. The variance of
¯vn is σ2
n = kBT /m + kBT /M , while the variance of ¯vθ as
well as ¯vϕ is σ2
t = kBT R2/I + kBT /m + kBT /M , where
I = χM R2. Evaluation of the average yields

hK(0)2i =

16

h p2π(kBT )3µnR2 1 + (2 − Γ)χM/µ

1 + χM/µ

.

(B7)

The friction coeﬃcient, which we will denote as Enskog
friction, follows by integration of the force autocorrela-
tion function according to Eq. (24). Since MPC is a
discrete-time-random process, the integral is

Z ∞

0

dthK(t) · K(0)i =

h
2hK(0)2i + h

∞

Xl=1

hK(lh) · K(0)i.
(B8)

Within the molecular chaos approximation, hK(lh) ·
K(0)i = 0 for l 6= 0, and we ﬁnd the Enskog friction
coeﬃcient

γE =

8

3p2πkBT µnR2 1 + (2 − Γ)χM/µ

1 + χM/µ

,

(B9)

In the time continuum limit, the force autocorrelation
function is a delta distribution

hK(t) · K(0)i = 6kBT γEδ(t),

(B10)

12

which leads to the exponentially decaying velocity-
autocorrelation function

Cu(t) =

kBT
M

e−γE t/M .

(B11)

The rotational motion is treated in a similar manner. For
the torque autocorrelation function at time t = 0 we ﬁnd

hN (0)2i =Z dΩ(cid:28) dN

16nR4

=

dΩ

(Rn × J)2(cid:29) /h2
h p2π(kBT )3µ(1 − Γ)

and hence, for the rotational friction coeﬃcient

ξE =

[52] Since v is a polar vector, A has to be an axial vector. But
as ˆΩ already is an axial vector, and ˆv should be linear in
ˆΩ, the Ansatz A = f (r) ˆΩ is well motivated [49].
