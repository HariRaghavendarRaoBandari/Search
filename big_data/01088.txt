ABSTRACT

Mergers of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) are considered as one of the potential pro-
genitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Recent hydrodynamical simulations showed that the less
massive (secondary) WD violently accretes onto the more massive (primary) one, carbon detonation
occurs, the detonation wave propagates through the primary, and the primary ﬁnally explodes as a
sub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia. Such an explosion mechanism is called the violent merger scenario.
Based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of merging CO WDs, we derived
more stringent critical mass ratio (qcr) leading to the violent merger scenario than the previous re-
sults. We conclude that this diﬀerence mainly comes from the diﬀerences in the initial condition,
synchronously spinning of WDs or not. Using our new results, we estimated the brightness distribu-
tion of SNe Ia in the violent merger scenario and compared it with previous studies. We found that
our new qcr does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the brightness distribution. We present the direct outcome
immediately following CO WD mergers for various primary masses and mass ratios. We also discussed
the ﬁnal fate of the central system of the bipolar planetary nebula Henize 2-428, which was recently
suggested to be a double CO WD system whose total mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar-limiting mass,
merging within the Hubble time. Even considering the uncertainties in the proposed binary param-
eters, we concluded that the ﬁnal fate of this system is almost certainly a sub-Chandrasekhar mass
SN Ia in the violent merger scenario.

1. INTRODUCTION

SNe Ia have been considered as thermonuclear explo-
sions of a CO WD. They play important roles in astron-
omy as a standard candle to determine the cosmologi-
cal parameters (e.g., Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al.
1999) and as major sources of iron group elements (e.g.,
Kobayashi et al. 1998). However, their progenitor sys-
tems and explosion mechanisms are still uncertain (e.g.,
Hillebrandt et al. 2000; Maoz et al. 2014). A merger of
CO WDs has been considered as one of the potential pro-
genitors of SNe Ia, which is called the double degenerate
(DD) scenario (Iben & Tutukov 1984; Webbink 1984).
A binary of CO WDs loses its angular momentum by
emitting gravitational waves and ﬁnally merges. When
the total mass exceeds the critical mass(Mig = 1.38 M⊙,
Nomoto et al. 1984) for the carbon ignition in the center,
such a system has been proposed to give rise to an SN Ia
explosion. Some observational studies reported that nei-
ther surviving companions (e.g., Gonz´alez Hern´andez et
al. 2012; Kerzendorf et al. 2012; Schaefer & Pagnotta
2012) nor signatures of them (e.g., Brown et al. 2012;
Foley et al.
2015) were detected
in some well-studied SN Ia remnants and nearby SNe Ia,

2012; Olling et al.

but recently there are several examples which possibly
show these signatures as well both in SNe with special
properties (McCully et al. 2014; Cao et al. 2015) and in
a normal SN Ia (Marion et al. 2015). These studies sug-
gest that at least a part of SNe Ia would originate from
either the DD scenario or the J(angular momentum)-loss
induced “delayed” carbon ignition in the single degener-
ate (SD) scenario (e.g., Benvenuto et al. 2015).

2006; Motl et al.

After Benz et al. (1990) ﬁrstly performed three di-
mensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of CO WD
mergers with their SPH code (e.g., Gingold & Monaghan
1982; Monaghan 2005; Rosswog 2009), similar merger
simulations have been performed by various groups (e.g.,
Rasio & Shapiro 1995; Segretain & Chabrier 1997; Guer-
rero et al. 2004; D’Souza et al.
2007; Yoon et al. 2007; Lor´en-Aguilar et al. 2009; Fryer
et al. 2010; Pakmor et al. 2010, 2011, 2012a,b; Dan et
al. 2011, 2012, 2014; Raskin et al. 2012, 2014; Zhu et
al. 2013; Moll et al. 2014; Kashyap et al. 2015; Sato et
al. 2015; Tanikawa et al. 2015). These studies showed
that a CO WD merger could lead to an SN Ia if sev-
eral conditions are satisﬁed. Pakmor et al. (2010, 2011,
2012a,b) simulated mergers of CO WDs, both of the bi-
nary members have masses ∼ 1 M⊙, with their SPH
code. They found that the secondary WD violently ac-
creted onto the primary and carbon detonation would

2

Sato et al.

occur during the merger. They showed that detonation
wave propagated through the primary and the primary
ﬁnally exploded as an SN Ia. They called this explosion
mechanism “the violent merger scenario.” As the mass
ratio q ≡ M2/M1, where M1 is the primary mass and
M2 is the secondary mass, approaches unity, the mass
accretion becomes more violent and the carbon detona-
tion occurs more easily. Therefore, the mass ratio is an
important parameter for the violent merger scenario.

Pakmor et al. (2011) investigated the critical mass ratio
qcr above which the violent merger scenario is realized,
and found that qcr ∼ 0.8 for M1 = 0.9 M⊙. Dan
et al. (2012) studied mergers of WDs over a wide range
of masses, i.e., 0.2 ∼ 1.2 M⊙. They found that dynam-
ical carbon burning did not occur in all their models.
However, their numerical resolution was low (∼ 20, 000
particles per star). Sato et al.
(2015) performed SPH
simulations of CO WD mergers over a wide range of
masses (0.5 ∼ 1.1 M⊙) and with a resolution of 500,000
particles per M⊙, i.e., 500, 000 M −1
⊙ . They investigated
whether or not dynamical carbon burning would occur
during the merger. Pakmor et al. (2012b) and Sato et
al.
(2015) showed that the numerical resolution is an-
other important factor in studying the violent merger
scenario, and Sato et al. (2015) suggested that it should
be ≥ 500, 000 M −1
Assuming critical mass ratios for the violent merger
scenario based on the result of Pakmor et al. (2011),
Ruiter et al.
(2013) estimated the brightness distri-
bution of SNe Ia and suggested that it could be qualita-
tively consistent with what is observed (Li et al. 2011).
Because the critical mass ratio could have inﬂuence on
the distribution of SN Ia brightness, detailed investiga-
tion of the critical mass ratio is required to verify the
violent merger scenario.

⊙ (see also Tanikawa et al. 2015).

Recently, Santander-Garc´ıa et al. (2015) reported that
the central system of the bipolar planetary nebula (PN)
Henize 2-428 might be a super-Chandrasekhar DD pair.
They estimated the combined mass as ∼ 1.8 M⊙ and the
mass ratio as ∼ 1. Although there are some negative ar-
guments against their conclusion (e.g., Frew et al. 2015;
Garcia-Berro et al. 2015), Henize 2-428 is a candidate
progenitor for the violent merger scenario, if the inter-
pretation by Santander-Garc´ıa et al.
(2015) is correct.
While Sato et al.
(2015) have already simulated a set
of primary and secondary masses which cover a plausible
parameter space for Henize 2-428, their mass grids were
too coarse. In this paper, we perform some additional
(much ﬁner grids of the masses) SPH simulations of CO
WD mergers to accurately obtain the critical mass ratio
for the violent merger scenario. We try to derive the re-
lation between M1 and qcr, and compare it with previous
studies. We also use our results to discuss the ﬁnal fate
of Henize 2-428.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we
brieﬂy describe our numerical method. Our results are
shown in Section 3 and we discuss them in Section 4. We
summarize our ﬁndings in Section 5.

Figure 3 shows the density and temperature of the par-
ticle having smallest τCC/τdyn ratio in each merger sim-
ulation, where τCC and τdyn are carbon burning and dy-
namical timescales, respectively, as deﬁned below. Colors

2. NUMERICAL METHODS

Our SPH simulations of CO WD mergers are essen-
tially the same as those of Sato et al.
(2015). We used
the OcTree On OpenCL (OTOO) code, which was de-
veloped for various particle simulations for astrophysical
ﬂuid phenomena (Nakasato et al. 2012). The equation of
state (EOS) is that of Timmes & Swesty (2000). Initial
setups are also the same as those in Sato et al.
(2015),
which refer to Rasio & Shapiro (1995) and Dan et al.
(2011). Our CO WD models have an uniform compo-
sition of 50% carbon and 50% oxygen in mass. Sato et
al. (2015) simulated mergers of CO WDs whose masses
were 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1 M⊙.

In this paper, we performed additional simulations of
CO WD mergers to accurately determine the critical
mass ratio qcr to realize the violent merger scenario. We
add M2 = 0.725, 0.75, 0.775, 0.825, 0.85, and 0.875 M⊙
for each M1 = 0.75, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1 M⊙, because
qcr seems to be in this mass range (see Figure 5 of Sato
et al. 2015). The numerical resolution is 500 k per solar
mass (k ≡ 1, 024). Our SPH scheme derives the temper-
ature of a particle from the density and internal energy
through the EOS. The estimations of density and inter-
nal energy have some numerical noises, and the derived
temperature is also ﬂuctuated (Dan et al. 2012; Sato et
al. 2015; Tanikawa et al. 2015).

Because nuclear burning rate is sensitive to the tem-
perature, it might strongly enhance the ﬂuctuated tem-
perature. Therefore, we ﬁrstly performed our simulations
without nuclear reactions, as in our previous work (Sato
et al. 2015), and determined the critical mass ratio for
the violent merger scenario. Then, we added simulations
including nuclear reactions in order to conﬁrm that the
inclusion of nuclear burning in our SPH simulation in-
creases the temperature high enough to really satisfy the
detonation condition for the models above the critical
mass ratio (see Section 4.3).

rupted and accretes onto the primary, which is consistent
with previous studies. Black vertical dashed lines show
the time when our detonation condition, which is de-
scribed below in Section 3.1, is ﬁrst fulﬁlled. Figure 2

torial plane at the time which is indicated by the black
dashed lines in Figure 1. The proﬁle and morphology
are consistent with the similar cases in Pakmor et al.
(2012a,b).

3.1. Conditions for Violent Merger-Induced Explosion

For the violent merger scenario, it is crucial whether or
not carbon detonation occurs during a merger. Although
Pakmor et al. (2011) used the results of Seitenzahl et
al.
(2009) as the detonation condition, the treatment
is still controversial. In this paper, we judge it from the
condition to trigger the dynamical carbon burning. We
obtain the dynamical timescale (e.g., Nomoto 1982),

and the carbon burning timescale,

for each SPH particle. Here, ρ and T are particle’s den-
sity and temperature, respectively, CP is the speciﬁc heat
at constant pressure of a particle, G is the gravitational
constant, and ǫCC is the energy generation rate of carbon
burning (see Equation (6) of Sato et al. 2015). When
there are any particles that satisfy τCC < τdyn, carbon
ignites dynamically. We regard this as the detonation
condition.

If τCC < τdyn, the temperature increases more rapidly
than decreases by adiabatic expansion and accelerates
carbon burning. The temperature would increase high
enough to satisfy the detonation condition, such as the
results of Seitenzahl et al.
(2009). Thus, we con-
sider that the condition of the dynamical carbon burning
(τCC < τdyn) is a plausible detonation condition in the
case without nuclear reactions. We conﬁrm this later by
including carbon burning in our SPH code in Section 4.3.
As described in Section 2, temperature is possibly af-
fected by numerical noises in our SPH simulations. In
order to minimize the inﬂuence of temperature noise in
judging the condition for carbon detonation, we examine
whether the particle continuously satisﬁes the above con-
dition at least for a dynamical timescale (τdyn ∼ 0.4 s at
ρ ∼ 106 g cm−3). If so, we assume that dynamical carbon
burning is deﬁnitely initiated and detonation occurs.
For example, mergers of 0.8 + 0.8 M⊙ and 0.75 +
0.75 M⊙, which are surrounded by black frames in Fig-
ure 3, both satisfy τCC < τdyn. However, in the case of
0.75+0.75 M⊙, there are no particles which continuously
satisfy the above condition for a dynamical timescale.
We thus regard that detonation does not occur in the
merger of 0.75 + 0.75 M⊙. In the case of 0.8 + 0.8 M⊙, on
the other hand, three particles keep τCC < τdyn for longer
than τdyn. Therefore, we regard that carbon detonation
does occur in the case of 0.8 + 0.8 M⊙ and eventually the

system leads to an SN Ia in the violent merger scenario.

3.2. Critical Mass Ratio for Violent Merger Scenario

We plot our numerical results of violent merger sce-
nario in Figure 4. Here, the ﬁlled circles denote models
which satisfy our condition for carbon detonation while
the crosses do models which do not. The black dashed
line indicates M1 = M2. Figure 4 shows that car-
bon detonation occurs only in the models whose primary
and secondary masses are more massive than ∼ 0.8 M⊙,
which is consistent with the results of Sato et al. (2015).
We derived approximate formulae of the critical mass
ratio, qcr, as a function of the primary mass, M1, and
plot them in Figure 5, both of which are on logarithmic
scales. The red solid line is for an upper bound, while the
blue solid line is for a lower bound. They are represented
by

qcr = 0.82(cid:18) M1
qcr = 0.80(cid:18) M1

M⊙(cid:19)−0.91
M⊙(cid:19)−0.84

(upper bound),

(3)

(lower bound),

(4)

respectively. Considering the lowest mass ratios in which
the model satisﬁes our condition for carbon detonation,
we derive Equation (3). On the other hand, we derive
Equation (4) from the highest mass ratios in which the
model does not satisfy our condition for carbon detona-
tion.

If a sizable helium layer exists on the CO WD, helium
detonation could occur during merger and induce carbon
detonation (e.g. Guillochon et al. 2010; Dan et al. 2012;
Raskin et al. 2012; Pakmor et al. 2013; Tanikawa et al.
2015). In this helium-ignited violent merger scenario, qcr
could be smaller than Equations (3) and (4). But such a
study needs much ﬁner resolution because the occurrence
of helium detonation depends strongly on the mass of the
helium layer (e.g., Tanikawa et al. 2015). We leave such
a systematic study to our future work.

et al.

Pakmor

(2011) obtained qcr ∼ 0.8 for
M1 = 0.9 M⊙. Our results show a diﬀerent value of
qcr ∼ 0.9 for M1 = 0.9 M⊙. This discrepancy could arise
from the diﬀerences in (1) the initial conditions, (2) nu-
merical resolution, and (3) inclusion of nuclear burning.
We discuss these three eﬀects in this order.

Pakmor et al. (2011) used non-spinning WDs and set
them at the initial separation where the Roche lobe
overﬂow (RLOF) just started in the sense of Eggleton’s
(1983) approximation. On the other hand, we assume
that the WDs spin synchronously with the orbital mo-
tion, and set them at the initial separation large enough
to avoid the RLOF. We decrease the separation until the
RLOF starts (Rasio & Shapiro 1995; Dan et al. 2011;
Sato et al. 2015). For the initial condition of Pakmor
et al. (2011), as mentioned in Dan et al. (2011), the sec-
ondary accretes onto the primary more violently than
for the case of synchronously spinning WDs. As a result,
carbon detonation would occur easily. We examined the
merger of 0.9 + 0.75 M⊙ WDs in the similar initial con-
dition to that of Pakmor et al. (2011). We thereby found
that there exist 16 particles which satisfy the condition
for carbon detonation in this case, while there is no such
a particle for our initial condition (see Figure 3). Al-
though no deﬁnite conclusion has been reached yet, sev-
eral numerical studies suggest that compact WD binaries
would reach synchronization before their merging due to
angular momentum dissipation by tidally excited gravity
waves (e.g. Fuller & Lai 2014, and references therein).

4.2. Numerical resolution

Numerical resolution might also cause the diﬀerence.
Sato et al.
(2015) reported that the maximum tem-
perature and the minimum τCC/τdyn ratio did not con-
verge in the range of 10k ∼ 500k M −1
⊙ . This is because
smaller hot regions can be resolved as the numerical res-
olution becomes higher. Several previous studies also
indicated that numerical resolution would aﬀect their re-
sults (e.g., Pakmor et al. 2011, 2012b).

sity and temperature of a particle which has the smallest
τCC/τdyn ratio for all the cases we recalculated includ-
ing nuclear burning. The symbols surrounded by black
frames are the results of the cases with carbon burning.
Since our simulations include only carbon burning, the
eﬀect of nuclear reactions would be underestimated. To
check this eﬀect, we perform post-processing calcula-
tions, using an α-chain reaction network containing 13
species from 4He to 56Ni (Timmes 1999). Figure 9 shows
the results for a particle which has the highest temper-
ature in the case of 0.9 + 0.8 M⊙. This calculation
was done for a period in which carbon burning contin-
ued. The red lines indicate the case with the α-chain
reaction network, while green lines do the case with only
carbon burning. Because we ﬁnd essentially no diﬀer-
ence between them, our simulations including only car-
bon burning are appropriated to estimate the eﬀect of
nuclear burning, and being consistent with the previous
studies using α-chain networks (Pakmor et al. 2010, 2011,
2012a; Raskin et al. 2012), at least until the initiation of
detonation. Thus, the inclusion of carbon burning low-
ers qcr to realize violent merger-induced explosion if we
use the same criterion as in Section 3.2. In Figure 10(a),
green triangles are the models which satisfy our deto-
nation condition with carbon burning, although they do
not satisfy the condition without.

However, our detonation condition in Section 3.2 is
considered under the situation without nuclear burning,
so it would be no longer valid in the case with carbon
burning. Therefore, for comparison with the results of
Pakmor et al. (2011), we adopt the same detonation con-
dition as theirs, i.e., the detection of particles having
ρ > 2 × 106 g cm−3 and T > 2.5 × 109 K (Seitenzahl
et al. 2009). The results are presented in Figure 10(b).
Although the boundary of Figure 10(b) is slightly lower
than that of Figure 4, the diﬀerence between them is
small. Thus, we conﬁrm that the detonation condition
adopted in Section 3.1 is plausible for the case without
nuclear reactions.

The approximated lines of qcr(M1) in the case with
carbon burning are also presented in Figure 5, where the

we performed several simulations with higher numerical
resolutions (1000k M −1
⊙ ) than our standard
ones (500k M −1
⊙ ), for 0.8 + 0.775 M⊙, 0.9 + 0.8 M⊙,
and 1.1 + 0.8 M⊙ WDs. Our numerical results are sum-
marized in Figure 6. The maximum temperature still
increases and the minimum τCC/τdyn ratio decreases ex-
cept for 0.8 + 0.775 M⊙ as the numerical resolution in-
creases. Similar trends were also reported in Pakmor
et al. (2012b), Sato et al.
(2015), and Tanikawa et al.
(2015). These trends indicate that our numerical results
have not been fully converged yet. Therefore, our critical
mass ratio could be slightly lower than the red solid line
in Figure 5.

4.3. Eﬀect of nuclear burning

Inclusion of nuclear reactions could also make the dif-
ference between theirs and ours. Pakmor et al. (2011)
found that particles with high temperature (≥ 2×109 K)
did not exist in the case of 0.9+0.81 M⊙ without nuclear
reactions. On the other hand, they existed in the case
with nuclear reactions.

In order to evaluate the eﬀect of nuclear energy re-
lease, we performed additional simulations including nu-
clear burning for some models.
In these simulations,
we include only carbon burning, i.e., 12C + 12C re-
action, to avoid large computational cost for solving a
reaction network. The formulation of the reaction rate
is the same as Equation (6) of our previous work (Sato
et al.
2015). Because the initiation of carbon detona-
tion is judged by this reaction, such a simple treatment
of nuclear reactions would be suﬃcient for our purpose.
Electron screening eﬀect is negligibly small in the region
of ρ = 106–107 g cm−3 and T > 2× 109 K, where carbon
detonation would occur, so we do not include this eﬀect.
Figure 7 shows the comparison between simulations
with and without carbon burning for the case of
0.9 + 0.8 M⊙. The red lines indicate the case with car-
bon burning, while the black ones do the case without.
Although the orbital evolution (Figure 7(a)) is almost the
same, the maximum temperature (Figure 7(c)) realized
in the case with carbon burning is higher than the case
without during the merger phase. This diﬀerence comes
from the nuclear energy release (Figure 7(b)). We con-

The value of qcr with carbon burning is slightly lower
than that without carbon burning. The lower bound
without carbon burning is almost the same as the upper
bound with carbon burning, so we adopt the boundary of
Equation (4). Then, our qcr is more stringent than that
derived in Pakmor et al. (2011). This diﬀerence mainly
comes from the initial condition as discussed in Section
4.1.

4.4. Brightness distribution in violent merger scenario

Using the results of Pakmor et al. (2011) and the binary

population synthesis (BPS) calculation (Ruiter et al.
2011), Ruiter et al.
(2013) estimated the brightness
distribution of SNe Ia arising from the violent merger
scenario. They adopted the value of qcr = 0.8 for M1 =
0.9 M⊙ from Pakmor et al. (2011), and assumed

qcr = min"0.8(cid:18) M1

0.9 M⊙(cid:19)−η

, 1.0# ,

(5)

where they used η = 0.0, 0.75, 1.5. We add these three
lines in Figure 5. Our qcr(M1) is basically more stringent
than Ruiter et al.’s (2013) assumptions.

In order to examine how our qcr(M1) would aﬀect the
brightness distribution of the violent merger scenario, we
adopt the same assumptions as in Ruiter et al.
(2013)
except for qcr(M1).

For the primary at the time of merging, we use the
same WD mass distribution as Ruiter et al. (2013) (see
also Ruiter et al. 2011), although it is highly uncertain
whether the WD can increase its mass by avoiding the
formation of a common envelope during the very rapid
accretion from the He star companion. We also assume
the same mWD − Mbol relation of SNe Ia as Ruiter et
al.’s (2013) (see Figure 4 in Ruiter et al. 2013; Sim et
al. 2010) and a ﬂat mass ratio distribution of DD sys-
tems for simplicity. Using either our critical mass ratio
or theirs, we calculated the brightness distribution and
compared them each other (Figure 11). We ﬁnd that
there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between them quali-
tatively. This result implies that the qcr of the violent

merger-induced explosion is not so crucial for the bright-
ness distribution of SNe Ia, as mentioned in Ruiter et
al.
(2013). Our results are closest to the η = 1.5
case among Ruiter et al.’s three cases. In the both cases
of our qcr and Ruiter et al.’s η = 1.5, the brightness
distribution concentrates around −19.0 mag. In Figure
11, we add the observational volume-limited brightness
distributions of SNe Ia. One in panel (a) is derived by
the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS, Li et al.
2011), and the other in panel (b) is obtained by ROTSE-
IIIb (see Table 1 in Quimby et al. 2012). The fraction of
faint events in our models is lower than the observation
of LOSS. This discrepancy might decrease if we consider
the viewing angle eﬀects (see also discussion in Ruiter et
al. 2013), which might be increasingly important espe-
cially for a large value of qcr. On the other hand, the
results of ROTSE-IIIb are consistent with ours, except
most luminous ( <
It should be
noted, however, that there are large uncertainties for the
observational brightness distribution (e.g., Quimby et
al. 2012) and our models are too simple to be compared
with the observational results. More detailed studies are
required to reach the deﬁnitive conclusion.

∼ − 19.5 mag) events.

As the mass ratio is approaching unity, the primary
is more strongly deformed by the secondary at merging.
As a result, the central density of the primary becomes
lower. Because the nucleosynthesis in SN Ia explosions is
so sensitive to the density proﬁle near the center of the
primary in the violent merger scenario, the amount of
56Ni decreases as the deformation of the primary becomes
higher (Pakmor et al. 2010, 2011). Since our qcr is higher
than that in the previous studies, the amount of 56Ni in
the violent merger scenario would decrease, while this
eﬀects are not included in our brightness estimates.

4.5. Outcome of mergers and ﬁnal fate of Henize 2-428

We summarize the ﬁnal fates of CO WD mergers in
the total mass versus mass ratio (Figure 12), as well as
in the mass ratio versus primary mass diagram (Figure

(2009).

The direct outcome is a violent merger-induced explo-
sion (VM) in the red hatched region. We adopt Equa-
tion (4) as the boundary of this immediate explosion. In
other regions, our condition for the violent merger sce-
nario is not satisﬁed and the merger remnant reaches a
quasi-stationary state.

The merger remnant consists of three parts, a cold core,
hot envelope, and outer disk (e.g. Benz et al. 1990). In
the blue hatched region, oﬀ-center carbon burning occurs
in the hot envelope (see, e.g., Sato et al. 2015) and the
core of the merger remnant would be converted to an
oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) WD (Saio & Nomoto
1985, 1998, 2004). Because the total mass exceeds Mig,
the merger remnant ﬁnally collapses to a neutron star,
i.e., the accretion induced collapse (AIC) (e.g., Nomoto
& Kondo 1991).

In the green hatched region, the core of the merger
remnant remains a CO WD because oﬀ-center carbon
burning does not occur in the early remnant phase
(102 − 103 s after the secondary is completely dis-
rupted, e.g., Sato et al. 2015). Further evolution of the
merger remnant depends on the viscosity and the accre-
tion of material from the outer Keplerian disk (Yoon et
al. 2007). If the viscous heating is suﬃciently large in the

viscous evolution phase (104 − 108 s, e.g., Mochkovitch
& Livio 1989), or if the accretion rate exceeds the criti-
cal rate of ∼ 2×10−6 M⊙ yr−1 in the thermal evolution
phase (105q − 106 yr, e.g., Nomoto & Iben 1985; Yoon
et al. 2007), oﬀ-center carbon burning is ignited. The
ﬁnal result would be AIC. On the other hand, if the vis-
cous heating is too small or if the accretion rate does
not exceed the critical rate, the mass of the merger rem-
nant could grow to exceed Mig without oﬀ-center carbon
burning. We should note that Mig of the rotating CO
WD is larger than 1.38 M⊙ because of the centrifugal
force, being 1.43 M⊙ if the rotation is uniform (or larger
if diﬀerential rotation). Eventually, the merger remnant
would explode or collapse depending on Mtot and the
timescale of the angular momentum loss from the merger
remnant (Benvenuto et al.
2015). We call the case of
explosion as the accretion induced explosion (AIE). Be-
cause of the above uncertainties, we indicate the green
hatched region as AIE/AIC in Figure 12. The bound-
ary between the AIC and AIE/AIC is derived from the
results of Sato et al. (2015).

In the magenta hatched region, because oﬀ-center car-
bon burning does not occur and the total mass of the
merger remnant does not exceed Mig, it possibly leaves
a massive CO WD (MWD). Outer boundaries are set
from the WD mass range (0.5 ∼ 1.1 M⊙).
Figures 12 and 13 could not be conclusive. If higher nu-
merical resolutions are applied, the VM region in Figures
12 and 13 would extend downward. As mentioned in Sec-
tion 4.1, the initial condition of simulations also aﬀects
the merger outcomes.
If we adopt non-synchronously
spinning systems as initial conditions, the VM and AIC
region might extend (e.g., Dan et al. 2011; Sato et al.
2015).

In Figure 13, we depict the results of previous works
for comparison. The squares indicate the models calcu-
lated by Pakmor et al. (2011). Their WD masses are
M2 = 0.70, 0.76, 0.81, and 0.89 M⊙ for M1 = 0.9 M⊙

al.
(2009), while the open one did not. Their results
indicate that qcr ∼ 0.8 for M1 = 0.9 M⊙. Note that
our boundary is qcr ∼ 0.9 for M1 = 0.9 M⊙, which is
more stringent than theirs.
We discuss the ﬁnal fate of Henize 2-428 on the basis
of our results. Henize 2-428 is a bipolar PN and its cen-
tral system was identiﬁed as a binary (e.g., Rodr´ıguez et
al. 2001). Santander-Garc´ıa et al. (2015) analyzed the
light curve and spectra of the central system. From the
depth of the light curve minima, the intensities of two
He II 541.2 nm absorption lines, and the obtained radial
velocity amplitudes, they interpreted the central system
of Henize 2-428 as a DD (double post-AGB core) sys-
tem with nearly equal masses and eﬀective temperatures.
They estimated the total mass of the central system as
1.76 M⊙, which clearly exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit.
They also derived the merging time of this system as
∼ 700 Myrs from the orbital period of 0.176 days. If their
interpretation is correct, the central system of Henize 2-
428 is the ﬁrst detected super-Chandrasekhar DD sys-
tem, which is a candidate of SN Ia progenitors in the
DD scenario. Because the mass ratio is close to unity, it
likely leads to an SN Ia in the violent merger scenario.

Santander-Garc´ıa et al.

(2015) ﬁxed the mass ratio
of the central system of Henize 2-428 at unity based
on the similar depths of light curve minima and the
radial velocity amplitudes.
In this paper, considering
1σ-uncertainties mentioned in Santander-Garc´ıa et al.
(2015), we derive possible ranges of the mass ratio and
primary mass without ﬁxing the mass ratio. In Figures
12 and 13, the black point with error bars depicts the
possible ranges of the mass ratio and primary mass thus
derived. Even considering the uncertainties of the mass
ratio and primary mass, we regard that Henize 2-428 is
a possible progenitor of SNe Ia in the violent merger sce-

5. SUMMARY

We summarize our main results as follows:
(1) Based on the SPH simulations of merging CO WDs,
we derived the critical mass ratio for the violent merger
scenario, i.e., the qcr versus M1 relation, and compared
our result with the previous studies. Our qcr(M1) is more
stringent than that derived by Pakmor et al. (2011). We
conclude that this small diﬀerence stems mainly from the
diﬀerences in the initial condition (synchronously spin-
ning or not).

(2) We conﬁrmed that the diﬀerence in the critical
mass ratio does not aﬀect the brightness distribution of
SNe Ia signiﬁcantly, as claimed in Ruiter et al.
(2013).
Our results are close to that of the η = 1.5 case in Ruiter
(2013) and consistent with the observational one
et al.
obtained by ROTSE-IIIb (Quimby et al.
2012). Our
larger qcr would also decrease the relative rate of higher
central density primary WDs at the merger, and as a re-
sult the total amount of 56Ni synthesized in the violent
merger would be reduced.

(3) We also summarized the direct outcome of CO WD
mergers and their ﬁnal fates in the diagram of Mtot ver-
sus q (and q versus M1). On the basis of this diagram,
we discussed the fate of the central system of the bipo-
lar planetary nebula Henize 2-428, which was recently
suggested to be a possible super-Chandrasekhar DD sys-
tem merging in a timescale much shorter than the Hubble
time. Even considering uncertainties of the proposed sys-
tem in the Mtot versus q diagram, we identify the ﬁnal
fate of this system as almost certainly an SN Ia in the
violent merger scenario.
