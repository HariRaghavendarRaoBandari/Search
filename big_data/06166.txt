ABSTRACT
Scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in galaxy clusters in-
duces polarization signals determined by the quadrupole anisotropy in the photon
distribution at the location of clusters. This ”remote quadrupole” derived from the
measurements of the induced polarization in galaxy clusters provides an opportunity
of reconstruction of local CMB temperature anisotropies. In this Letter we develop an
algorithm of the reconstruction through the estimation of the underlying primordial
gravitational potential, which is the origin of the CMB temperature and polarization
ﬂuctuations and CMB induced polarization in galaxy clusters. We found a nice re-
construction for the quadrupole and octopole components of the CMB temperature
anisotropies with the assistance of the CMB induced polarization signals. The re-
construction can be an important consistency test on the puzzles of CMB anomaly,
especially for the low quadrupole and axis of evil problems reported in WMAP and
Planck data.

INTRODUCTION

Large-scale anomalies have been reported in Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) temperature map with
independent observations. A low quadrupole
several
of CMB temperature anisotropies was ﬁrst
found in
COBE data (Hinshaw et al. 1996)
then conﬁrmed by
WMAP (WMAP Collaboration et al. 2003). The so-called
axis of evil, which is an unusual alignment of
the
preferred axes of
the quadrupole and octopole are
found by several authors (de Oliveira-Costa et al. 2004;
Land and Magueijo 2005; Samal et al. 2008). Other anoma-
lies
include power asymmetry in north/south hemi-
sphere (Eriksen et al. 2004; Hansen et al. 2009) and an
anomalous cold spot (Cruaz et al. 2006). If the anomalies
are not caused by foreground residuals or systematic eﬀects,
we are facing a challenge of understanding of fundamental
physics and the nature of the cosmos.

The polarization of the CMB is expected to provide
valuable information on the nature of CMB anomalies. It
is generated through Thomson scattering of temperature
anisotropies on the last scattering surface (Hu and White

1997). If the anomalies in the CMB temperature are pri-
mordial, the polarization should thus exhibit similar pecu-
liarities (see Vielva et al. 2011; Frommert and Ensslin 2010,
for examples related to the Cold Spot, axis of evil, respec-
tively).

One of the question here is that: Is it possible to recon-
struct CMB temperature map for the low multipole l from
other independent observations? If the answer is yes, then
the reconstructed temperature map may be used to distin-
guish whether the anomalies are primordial or systematic.
CMB polarization is one of the candidates. Due to the poor
correlation coeﬃcients (less than 0.5 for multipole l = 2 and
l = 3), however, the reconstruction from only CMB polar-
ization can not achieve our goal. The scattering of CMB
photons in clusters of galaxies may shed light on this at-
tempt.

The scattering of CMB photons in clusters of galax-
ies induces a polarization signal, which is determined by
the quadrupole anisotropy in the photon distribution at
the cluster location (Sazonov and Sunyaev 1999). There-
fore, the remote quadrupole in distant clusters, in princi-
ple, is investigable by the measurements of this induced
polarization signal. The measurements of these signals
were originally proposed to suppress the cosmic variance

uncertainty (Kamionkowski and Loeb 1997; Bunn 2006;
Portsmouth 2004). Moreover, the magnitude of these signals
gives some clues about the evolution of the CMB quadrupole
to probe the dark energy. Of particular interest here is that
it probes three-dimensional information of potential ﬂuctu-
ations around our last scattering surface (Seto and Sasaki
2000). Even though this induced polarization in galaxy clus-
ters has not beed observed, its detection contains rich infor-
mation for study of cosmology.

In this Letter we propose an independent observation
for the study of the CMB anomalies. We explore a practi-
cally useful cosmological probe from the measurements of
remote quadrupole: the reconstruction of CMB tempera-
ture anisotropies for low multipole. Provided by the strong
correlation of the remote quadrupole in low redshifts with
the local CMB (Hall and Challinor 2014), the reconstructed
CMB temperature anisotropies are accurate enough for dis-
tinguishing the sources of low quadrupole and axis of evil
problems.

2 SIMULATIONS OF CMB SKY AND CMB

INDUCED POLARIZATION IN DISTANT

GALAXY CLUSTERS

The CMB temperature anisotropies and E-mode po-
larization from a single plane wave can be written
as (Ma and Bertschinger 1995)

∆X(k, η, ˆn) = Xl

(−i)l(2l + 1)∆Xl(k, η)Pl(ˆk · ˆn),

(1)

where Pl is Legendre polynomial, ∆Xl is the transfer func-
tion with X = T, E for temperature anisotropies or E-mode
polarization, respectively. To compute the spherical harmon-
ics coeﬃcients of the temperature anisotropy and E-mode
polarization aX,lm and some derivations later, we need the
additional theorem of the spin-weighted spherical harmon-
ics (Ng and Liu 1999)

where α, β and γ are the Euler angles as being composed
of a rotation α around ˆe3, followed by β around the new
ˆe′

coeﬃcients are

2 and ﬁnally γ around ˆe′′

aX,lm = (−i)l4πZ d3kY ∗

lm(ˆk)∆Xl(k, η).

(3)

On the other hand, the polarization eﬀect in the
distant clusters of galaxies arises from the presence of
the quadrupole component of the CMB in the rest-frame
of a cluster. For a cluster located in the ˆz direction,
the primordial CMB quadrupole induced polarization is
(Ramos, da Silva and Liu 2012)

(4)

where τ is the optical depth across the cluster, QT and UT
are Stokes parameters in the unit of brightness tempera-
ture. We adopt here, by convection, QT < 0 (QT > 0) for

a N-S (E-W) polarization component and UT > 0 (UT < 0)
for a NE-SW (NW-SE) component. We have assumed that
free electrons in a cluster see the same CMB quadrupole
because the primordial CMB temperature quadrupole has
variations on much larger scales than the extent of indi-
vidual clusters (Ramos, da Silva and Liu 2012). Using the
addition theorem of spin-weighted spherical harmonics in
Eq.(2), we rewrite Eq. (5) for a cluster located in any line
of sight direction ˆn

All the CMB temperature anisotropy and its polariza-
tion and the polarization signal at distant clusters of galax-
ies can be computed directly from Eqs.(3) and (5), provided
that the ∆Xl(k, η) for each wave-mode is known. Since the
evolution of ∆Xl(k, η) is independent of the direction of k,
we may write ∆Xl(k, η) = ∆Xl(k, η)Ψ(k), where Ψ(k) is
the primordial gravitational potential. This primordial grav-
itational potential Ψ(k) that appears in Eq. (3) and (5) is
the origin of CMB temperature and polarization ﬂuctua-
tions and primordial CMB induced polarization in galaxy
clusters. Therefore, estimating the primordial gravitational
potential in three-dimensional Fourier space is our ﬁrst step
for the reconstruction.

It is usual to assume that the two-point correlation func-

tion of the Ψ(k) has the form

< Ψ∗(k)Ψ(k′) >= PΨ(k)δ3(k − k′),

and the power spectrum PΨ(k) obeys a power-law

PΨ(k) = Akns−4

(6)

(7)

with A being a normalization factor and ns a spectral index
of the scalar perturbations.

To compute the simulation data, we ﬁrst generate the
three-dimensional primordial gravitational potential Ψ(k)
by drawing a random number from a gaussian distribution
with variance PΨ(k) for each wave-mode. The time evolu-
tion of the transfer function ∆Xl(k, η) is calculated numeri-
cally by the CMBFast (Seljak and Zaldarriaga 1996) Boltz-
mann code, assuming the cosmological parameters from the
Planck 2013 results (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014). Dif-
ferent skies can be generated by changing the seed of our ran-
dom number generator routine. Given the simulated primor-
dial gravitational potential, we generate CMB data aT ,lm
and aE,lm using Eq.(3) and polarization data in clusters QT
and UT using Eq. (5). The observed CMB induced polariza-
tion in clusters is linear proportional to the cluster’s optical
depth, which may be extracted from X-ray surface bright-
ness observations if the temperature proﬁle is known. Here
we simply assume τ = 1. The position of the galaxy clus-
ters is assumed to be randomly distributed in the universe
from z = 0 to 4. We perform the integration in Eqs.(3) and
(5) by summing the contribution from each Fourier mode
in spherical coordinates. In each radial direction of k, we
have sampled uniformly 240 modes in logarithm space from
k = 7× 10−6 to 1.4× 10−1 h/Mpc. The angular directions of
(θk, φk) are obtained by the Healpix scheme (Gorski et al.
2005) at resolution-5 map.

3 RECONSTRUCTION OF CMB

TEMPERATURE ANISOTROPIES

We present in Fig. (1) a typical sky realization of the CMB
temperature anisotropies (l ≤ 16) and its quadrupole and
octopole components. In order to reconstruct this CMB tem-
perature map with CMB induced polarization in galaxy clus-
ters from the same realization, we ﬁrst estimate the primor-
dial gravitational potential using Bayes’ theorem

P r(Ψ|d) ∝ P r(d|Ψ)P r(Ψ),

(8)

where P r(Ψ) is the prior probability, P r(d|Ψ) is the likeli-
hood of obtaining the data d = {QT , UT} given a realization
of primordial gravitational potential Ψ. The estimation of Ψ
is obtained by minimizing the function

where σQT and σUT are instrument noise of observation,

Ψ(k), ˆQT ,j and ˆUT ,j are the reconstructed Stokes parameters

in the right side is the logarithm of the prior.

There must be many possible sets of Ψ corresponding
to one observation within the desired uncertainty since the
number of modes nk is much bigger than the number of
data nc. Therefore, the reconstructed Ψ diﬀer with the in-
put, while the reconstructed Stokes parameters in the galaxy
clusters do not change too much. However, reducing nk to
avoid the overﬁtting produces another problem. It generates
the spurious correlation between the induced polarization in
clusters and the CMB temperature anisotropy and E-mode
polarization once we reduce the number of modes nk in ra-

dial direction. Moreover, the orthogonality property of the
spherical harmonics may be broken once we reduce the num-
ber of modes nk in angular direction. When we perform the
minimization, we use a smaller number of nk than the input.
We reduce the number of sampling from 240 to 60 for the ra-
dial direction, and number of pixel from Healpix resolution-5
to resolution-3 map for the angular direction of k. The total
number of the parameters in the ﬁtting is 46080 (complex
variables). The relative errors of QT , UT and aX,lm with
l ≤ 10 in this conﬁguration are less than 3%. We also tested
bigger nk but it does not signiﬁcantly change our conclusion
below.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In Fig. (2) we present the reconstructed temperature map
(l ≤ 10) and its quadrupole and octopole components with
the estimated Ψ, which is obtained by ﬁtting to the simu-
lated data from 300 galaxy clusters whose redshifts z < 1.0
in our catalog. It is obvious that the reconstructed tempera-
ture map loses power on small angular scales. However, with
the assistance of strong correlation of remote quadrupole
with local CMB, the quadrupole component is almost com-
pletely reconstructed and the octopole component is also
similar to the simulated one. It shows the feasibility of the
reconstruction with our algorithm and the results should be
useful for the study of anomalies in CMB maps. For the
higher multipole, the reconstruction becomes worse due to
the more deviation of the transfer functions from that of
remote quadrupole with increasing l.

We forecast the observation strategy for the induced
polarization in galaxy clusters. To quantify the goodness of
the reconstruction, we deﬁned the dimensionless correlation

coeﬃcient rl = Pm aT ,lmˆaT ,lm/(2l + 1)pCl ˆCl and error of
reconstruction El = Pm(ˆaT ,lm − aT ,lm)2/(2l + 1)Cl with Cl
the input temperature power spectrum from simulation. We
make 100 realizations and select the observed galaxy clusters
with redshifts z ≤ zh. We show the average of rl and El as
function of nc for l = 2, 3 and 4 in Fig (3) with ﬁxed zh = 1.

With tens of observed galaxy clusters the quadrupole com-
ponent can be perfectly reconstructed and be useful for the
investigation of low quadrupole problem. The reconstruction
of higher multipole components improves with the increas-
ing number of observed galaxy clusters. We also test the
reconstruction by adding E-mode polarization data (dashed
curves). With the additional data aE,lm for l ≤ 10, the re-
construction of octopole and higher multipole anisotropies
improves signiﬁcantly through the T E correlation. The rela-
tion of the reconstruction and the depth of the observation
is shown in Fig. (4). The remote quadrupole of observed in
high redshift galaxy clusters probes the universe on scales
smaller to the local CMB, so the reconstruction of octopole
and higher multipole improves with increasing zh.

The procedure we have here is something of an ideal-
ization. We assume the optical depth through the galaxy
clusters is precisely measured and the instrumental noise
is signiﬁcantly small (σQT = σUT = σlm = 10−3µK). We
also ignore all the contaminations of the polarization signal,
for example, the polarization induced by the transverse pe-
culiar velocity of the galaxy clusters (Sazonov and Sunyaev
1999; Ramos, da Silva and Liu 2012) and the background
polarization. The signal is probably detectable in the next-
generation polarization experiments with broad frequency
coverage such as PRISM (Prism Collaboration et al. 2013)
but the separation of the quadrupole signal from the other
contaminants would be an experimental challenge.
