Abstract—With the potential to ﬁnd global solutions, signiﬁcant
research interest has focused on convex relaxations of the non-
convex OPF problem. Recently, “moment-based” relaxations
from the Lasserre hierarchy for polynomial optimization have
been shown capable of globally solving a broad class of OPF
problems. Global solution of many large-scale test cases is
accomplished by exploiting sparsity and selectively applying the
computationally intensive higher-order relaxation constraints.
Previous work describes an iterative algorithm that indicates the
buses for which the higher-order constraints should be enforced.
In order to speed computation of the moment relaxations, this
paper provides a study of the key parameter in this algorithm as
applied to relaxations from both the original Lasserre hierarchy
and a recent complex extension of the Lasserre hierarchy.

I. INTRODUCTION

The non-convex optimal power ﬂow (OPF) problem is one
of the most important power system optimization problems.
The OPF problem minimizes an objective function subject to
physical network constraints and engineering limits. There is
an extensive literature of solution techniques for OPF prob-
lems, including successive quadratic programs, Lagrangian re-
laxation, heuristic optimization, and interior point methods [1],
[2]. However, while these local solution techniques often ﬁnd
global solutions [3], they may fail to converge or converge to
a local optimum [4], [5].

Recent research has focused on convex relaxations of the
OPF problem. Convex relaxations lower bound the objective
value and can certify infeasibility of OPF problems. For
many OPF problems, a convex relaxation based on semidef-
inite programming (SDP) is exact (i.e., the lower bound is
tight and the solution provides the globally optimal decision
variables) [6]. A second-order cone programming (SOCP)
relaxation is provably exact for radial systems that satisfy
certain non-trivial technical conditions [7]. Developing tighter
and faster relaxations is an active research area [8]–[10].

This paper focuses on a generalization of the SDP relaxation
of [6] using the Lasserre hierarchy of semideﬁnite relaxations

for real polynomial optimization problems [11]. The primal
form of the Lasserre hierarchy is interpreted as a truncated
moment series, while the dual form is interpreted as a sum-
of-squares optimization problem. We therefore refer to the
order-γ relaxation in this hierarchy as MSOSγ-R.

The OPF problem is a polynomial optimization problem
in terms of the complex voltage phasors. Separating the
complex voltages into real and imaginary parts yields a
polynomial optimization problem in real variables. The ﬁrst-
order relaxation in the Lasserre hierarchy (i.e., MSOS1-R) is
equivalent to the SDP relaxation of [6]. Higher-order moment
relaxations globally solve a broader class of OPF problems at
the computational cost of larger SDPs.

Recent work builds a complex hierarchy MSOSγ-C that is
inspired by the Lasserre hierarchy [12]. Rather than decom-
posing into real and imaginary parts, this complex hierarchy
is directly constructed from the complex voltages, which
provides computational advantages for many problems. This
paper summarizes MSOSγ-C through analogy to MSOSγ-R.
The computational requirements of both MSOSγ-R and
MSOSγ-C grow quickly with increasing relaxation order γ.
Fortunately, low-order relaxations (γ 6 2) solve many small
OPF problems [13]–[15]. However, dense formulations for
low-order relaxations are intractable for problems with more
than approximately ten buses. Applying a “chordal sparsity”
technique for the ﬁrst-order relaxations enables solution of
OPF problems with thousands of buses [16], [17]. Extending
the chordal sparsity technique to higher-order relaxations [18]
facilitates the solution of the second-order relaxation for OPF
problems with up to approximately 40 buses [19].

Selectively enforcing the computationally intensive higher-
order constraints only at “problematic” buses enables exten-
sion to larger problems [19], including some OPF problems
with thousands of buses [12], [20]. The iterative algorithm
in [19] applies the higher-order relaxation constraints to spe-
ciﬁc buses identiﬁed with a heuristic, based on “power injec-
tion mismatches”, that provides an indication of the quality
of the solution at each bus. (Further details are provided in
Section III-C.)

The algorithm in [19] requires a single parameter specifying
how many buses should have higher-order constraints applied
at each iteration. There is a computational trade-off associated
with this parameter: applying higher-order constraints at more

buses potentially requires fewer iterations but a larger com-
putational cost per iteration. By balancing this trade-off, this
parameter can have a large impact on overall solution times.
To improve the computational effectiveness of both
MSOSγ-R and MSOSγ-C, this paper presents a study of this
parameter. Speciﬁcally, appropriate choice of this parameter
is investigated by applying the algorithm in [19] to a variety
of large test cases (Polish models in MATPOWER [21] and
European models from the PEGASE project [22]).

This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the
OPF problem in complex variables. Section III summarizes
MSOSγ-R and MSOSγ-C as applied to the OPF problem,
including the sparsity-exploiting algorithm in [19]. Section IV
presents a computational study of the parameter in this algo-
rithm. Section V concludes the paper.

II. OPF PROBLEM FORMULATION

We ﬁrst present an OPF formulation in terms of complex
voltages, active and reactive power injections, and apparent-
power line-ﬂow limits. Consider an n-bus power system,
where N = {1, 2, . . . , n} is the set of all buses, G is the set of
generator buses, and L is the set of all lines. Let PDk + jQDk
represent the active and reactive load demand, where j is
the imaginary unit, and Vk the complex voltage phasor at
each bus k ∈ N . Superscripts “max” and “min” denote
speciﬁed upper and lower limits. Buses without generators
have maximum and minimum generation set
to zero. Let
Y denote the network admittance matrix. The generator at
bus k ∈ G has a quadratic cost function for active power
generation with coefﬁcients ck2 > 0, ck1, and ck0.
We use a line model with an ideal transformer that has a
speciﬁed turns ratio τlmejθlm : 1 in series with a Π circuit with
series impedance Rlm + jXlm (equivalent to an admittance of
ylm =

) and shunt admittance jbsh,lm [21].

III. RELAXATION HIERARCHIES

The OPF formulation is composed of polynomials, which
enables global solution using polynomial optimization the-
ory. Separating the complex decision variables into real and
imaginary components Vk = Vdk + jVqk facilitates the
application of moment/sum-of-squares relaxations MSOSγ-R
from the Lasserre hierarchy [11] to the OPF problem [13]–
[15], [19]. Directly building a relaxation hierarchy from the
complex polynomial optimization formulation yields complex
moment/sum-of-squares relaxations MSOSγ-C [12]. This sec-
tion reviews these hierarchies in the context of the OPF
problem and discusses methods for exploiting sparsity.

A. Hierarchy for Real Polynomial Optimization Problems

The Lasserre hierarchy MSOSγ-R builds relaxations that
take the form of semideﬁnite programs. For generic polyno-
mial optimization problems that satisfy a technical condition1,
relaxations in the Lasserre hierarchy converge to the global
solutions of generic polynomial optimization problems at a
ﬁnite relaxation order [11], [23]. While the Lasserre hierarchy
can ﬁnd all global solutions, we focus on OPF problems with
a single global optimum.2

We begin with several deﬁnitions. Deﬁne the vector of real

. . . Vqn(cid:3)⊺.3
decision variables ξ ∈ R2n as ξ := (cid:2)Vd1 Vd2
A monomial is deﬁned using a vector α ∈ N2n of expo-
nents: ξα := V α1
qn . A polynomial is g (ξ) :=
Pα∈N2n gαξα, where gα is the real scalar coefﬁcient corre-
Deﬁne a linear functional Ly {g} which replaces the mono-
mials ξα in a polynomial g (ξ) with real scalar variables y:

d2 ··· V α2n
sponding to the monomial ξα.

d1 V α2

Ly {g} := Xα∈N2n

gαyα.

(2)

For a matrix g (ξ), Ly {g} is applied componentwise.
Consider, for example, the vector ξ = (cid:2)Vd1 Vd2 Vq2(cid:3)⊺
corresponding to the voltage components of a two-bus system,
where the angle reference is used to eliminate Vq1, and the
polynomial g (ξ) = − (0.9)2 + V 2
q2. (The constraint
g (ξ) > 0 forces the voltage magnitude at bus 2 to be greater
than or equal to 0.9 per unit.) Then Ly {g} = − (0.9)2 y000 +
y020 + y002. Thus, Ly {g} converts a polynomial g (ξ) to a
linear function of y.

d2 + V 2

1This technical condition is satisﬁed when the decision variables are

bounded and is therefore not restrictive for the OPF problem.

2See [19] for a discussion of atypical cases with multiple global optima.
3The ability to select an angle reference in the OPF problem enables

speciﬁcation of one arbitrarily chosen variable. We choose Vq1 = 0.

For the order-γ relaxation, deﬁne a vector xγ consisting of

all monomials of the voltage components up to order γ:

xγ :=(cid:2) 1 Vd1

. . . V 2

. . . Vqn V 2
qn V 3
d1 V 2

d1 Vd1Vd2
d1Vd2

. . .
. . . V γ

The relaxations are composed of positive semideﬁnite con-
straints on moment and localizing matrices. The symmetric
moment matrix Mγ is composed of entries yα corresponding
to all monomials ξα up to order 2γ:

(3)

qn (cid:3)⊺ .

γ(cid:9) .
Mγ {y} := Ly(cid:8)xγ x⊺

Symmetric localizing matrices are deﬁned for each con-
straint of (1). For a polynomial constraint g (ξ) > 0 of degree
2η, the localizing matrix is:

(4)

(5)

Mγ−η {gy} := Ly(cid:8)gxγ−ηx⊺

γ−η(cid:9) .

See (8a) and (9a) for example moment and localizing matrices
for MSOS2-R applied to a two-bus OPF problem.

Separating real and imaginary parts Vk = Vdk + jVqk, deﬁne
fP k, fQk, and fV k for the active power injection, reactive
power injection, and squared voltage magnitudes at bus k
using (1b), (1c), and (1d), respectively, as functions of the
real variables Vd and Vq. Likewise, deﬁne fSlm for the squared
apparent power ﬂow on the line from bus l to bus m using (1e)
and fCk as the quadratic cost function for the generator at
bus k using (1a) as functions of the real variables Vd and Vq.

where < 0 indicates that the corresponding matrix is positive
semideﬁnite and ⋆ represents any integer in [0, 2γ − 1]. The
constraint (6j) enforces the fact
that x0 = 1. The con-
straint (6k) corresponds to the angle reference Vq1 = 0; the ρ
in (6k) is in the index n+ 1, which corresponds to the variable
Vq1. Note that the angle reference can alternatively be used to
eliminate all terms corresponding to Vq1 to reduce the size of
the semideﬁnite program.

A dual form of the “moment” relaxation presented here is
a sum-of-squares program, thus leading to the nomenclature
MSOSγ-R [11]. There is zero duality gap between the moment
and sum-of-squares formulations for the OPF problem [24].
The order-γ relaxation yields a single global solution if
rank (Mγ {y}) = 1. The global solution V ∗ to the OPF
problem (1) is then determined by a spectral decomposition
of the diagonal block of the moment matrix corresponding
to the second-order monomials (i.e., |α| = 2, where | · |
indicates the one-norm). Speciﬁcally, let η be a unit-length
eigenvector corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalue λ of

V ∗ = √λ(cid:0)η1:n + jη(n+1):2n(cid:1) is the globally optimal voltage

Note that the order γ of the relaxation must be greater
than or equal to half of the degree of any polynomial in
the OPF problem (1). Although direct implementation of (1)
requires γ > 2 due to the fourth-order polynomials in the cost
function (1a) and apparent-power line-ﬂow constraints (1e),
these can be rewritten using a Schur complement [6] to allow
γ > 1. Experience suggests that implementing (1a) and (1e)
both directly and with a Schur complement formulation gives
superior results for γ > 2.

B. Hierarchy for Complex Polynomial Optimization Problems
Rather than ﬁrst separating the decision variables into real
and imaginary parts Vd and Vq, a hierarchy of relaxations,
denoted as MSOSγ-C, built directly from (1) in complex
variables has computational advantages for many OPF prob-
lems [12]. Presentation of the complex hierarchy MSOSγ-C
mirrors the development of MSOSγ-R in Section III-A.

Deﬁne a linear functional ˆLˆy (g) which replaces the mono-
mials in a polynomial g (ζ) with complex scalar variables ˆy:

1

ˆLˆy {g} := Xα,β∈Nn

gα,β ˆyα,β.

(10)

For a matrix g (ζ), ˆLˆy {g} is applied componentwise.
Consider, for example, the vector ζ = (cid:2)V1 V2(cid:3)⊺ cor-
responding to the complex voltage phasors of a two-bus
system and the polynomial g (ζ) = − (0.9)2 + V2V2. (The
constraint g (ζ) > 0 forces the voltage magnitude at bus 2
to be greater than or equal to 0.9 per unit.) Then ˆLˆy {g} =
− (0.9)2 ˆy00,00 + ˆy01,01. Thus, ˆLˆy {g} converts a polynomial
g (ζ) to a linear function of ˆy.
For the order-γ relaxation, deﬁne a vector zγ consisting of
all monomials of the voltages up to order γ without complex
conjugate terms (i.e., β = 00 ··· 0):

4For the example (7a), (8a),

the angle reference was established by

eliminating Vq1. Therefore, k = 2n for this case.

(12)

Symmetric localizing matrices are deﬁned for each con-
straint of (1). For a polynomial constraint g (ζ) > 0 with
largest degree |α + β| among all monomials equal to 2η,5 the
localizing matrix is:

Deﬁne ˆfP k, ˆfQk, and ˆfV k for the active power injection,
reactive power injection, and squared voltage magnitudes at

apparent power ﬂow on the line from bus l to bus m using (1e)

Rather than explicitly setting an angle reference, we rotate the
solution to (14) in order to satisfy (1f). Note that a Schur
complement formulation for (1a) and (1e) enables solution
of (14) with γ = 1 [6].

Similar to the real hierarchy, MSOSγ-C yields a single

global solution if rank(cid:0) ˆMγ{ˆy}(cid:1) = 1. The global solution V ∗
is calculated using a spectral decomposition of the diagonal
block of the moment matrix corresponding to the second-order
monomials (i.e., |α| = |β| = 1). Let ˆη be a unit-length
eigenvector corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalue ˆλ of
. Then the vector V ∗ =pˆλˆη, rotated to
(cid:2) ˆM1{ˆy}(cid:3)(2:n+1,2:n+1)

match the angle reference, gives the globally optimal voltages.
We next summarize theoretical developments for MSOSγ-C
applied to the OPF problem.6 These developments, which are
proven in [12], relate to duality, convergence, and comparison
to the real hierarchy. See [11] for similar results for MSOSγ-R.

5For OPF problems, all constraint and cost-function polynomials (other

than the reference angle (1f), which is discussed later) have even degree.

6These statements do not hold for all polynomial optimization problems.

1) Analogous to the real hierarchy, MSOSγ-C can be
interpreted in a dual sum-of-squares form. There is zero
duality gap between the primal (14) and dual forms.

2) The relaxations MSOS1-R and MSOS1-C, and the re-
laxation in [6] all give the same optimal objective values.
3) Augmenting the OPF problem with a sphere constraint

i

)2 ,

(15)

where ψ is a slack variable, guarantees convergence of
MSOSγ-C to the global optimum with increasing γ.
Observe that the sphere constraint is redundant due to
the upper voltage magnitude limits (1d) and therefore
does not impair the applicability of MSOSγ-C.

4) For MSOSγ-C with the sphere constraint (15) and

MSOSγ-R of the same order γ:

a) The optimal objective value from MSOSγ-R is at

least as large as that from MSOSγ-C.

b) There exist optimization problems for which
MSOSγ-R gives strictly superior objective values.
c) Numerical results support the conjecture (formal-
ized in [12]) that MSOSγ-C yields the same op-
timal objective value as MSOSγ-R when applied
to complex polynomial optimization problems that
exhibit rotational symmetry, such as OPF prob-
lems.

5) For an n-bus system,

the size of the moment ma-
trices (6i) and (14i) for MSOSγ-R (using the angle
reference (6k) to eliminate Vq1) and MSOSγ-C (con-
verted to real representation for input to the solver [25,
Example 4.42]) are (2n − 1 + γ)!/ ((2n − 1)!γ!) and
2 ((n + γ)!) / (n!γ!), respectively. For example, n = 10
and γ = 3 correspond to matrices of size 1,540× 1,540
and 572 × 572 for the real and complex hierarchies,
respectively. Thus, the complex hierarchy is signiﬁcantly
more computationally tractable than the real hierarchy.

C. Exploiting Network Sparsity

computationally superior

Although MSOSγ-C is

to
MSOSγ-R, matrices for both hierarchies grow quickly with the
relaxation order γ. Practical evaluation of both hierarchies for
large problems requires low relaxation order. Fortunately, low-
order relaxations often yield high-quality lower bounds and,
in many cases, the global optima for practical OPF problems.
However, for n & 10, the “dense” formulations (6) and (14)
are intractable even for γ = 2. Exploiting network sparsity
enables the application of the hierarchies to many large
problems. First proposed for the OPF problem in [16], a
“chordal sparsity” technique enables solution of the ﬁrst-order
relaxation for systems with thousands of buses [17]. The
approach in [18] extends these chordal sparsity techniques
to higher relaxation orders of the real hierarchy and can
be readily applied to the complex hierarchy. Each positive
semideﬁnite matrix constraint is replaced by a set of positive
semideﬁnite matrix constraints on certain submatrices. These

submatrices are deﬁned by the maximal cliques of a specif-
ically constructed chordal extension of the network graph.
See [12], [19] for a detailed description of this approach.

When the relaxation order γ = 1, the “sparse” versions of
the moment/sum-of-squares hierarchies give equivalent solu-
tions to their dense counterparts. However, this is not the case
for γ > 1: the sparse hierarchies are generally not as tight
as the dense hierarchies [11]. Nevertheless, low-order sparse
hierarchies globally solve many practical problems.

Applying the chordal sparsity approach enables solution of
OPF problems with n . 40. Extension to larger problems is
possible by recognizing that the computationally challenging
higher-order relaxations are only necessary for the constraints
associated with speciﬁc buses. In other words, rather than a
single relaxation order γ applied to all buses in the problem,
each bus i has an associated relaxation order γi. By both ex-
ploiting sparsity and selectively applying the computationally
intensive higher-order relaxation constraints, many large OPF
problems are computationally tractable.

Selectively applying the higher-order constraints requires a
method for determining γi for each bus. We use a heuristic
based on “power injection mismatches” to the closest rank-one
matrix [19]. Consider the application of the complex hierarchy
to an OPF problem with a single global optimum. (Application
of the real hierarchy proceeds analogously.) An “approximate”
solution zapprox to the OPF problem can be obtained from the
largest eigenvalue ˆλ1 and associated unit-length eigenvector ˆη1

of the matrix(cid:2) ˆM1{ˆy}(cid:3)(2:n+1,2:n+1)

each bus i, deﬁne a power injection mismatch Smis

We employ an iterative algorithm for determining relaxation
orders γi, i = 1, . . . , n. (See Algorithm 1.) Each iteration of
the algorithm solves the relaxation after increasing the relax-
ation orders γi in a manner that is dependent on the largest
associated Smis
values. At each iteration of the algorithm,
calculate γmax := maxi {γi}.7 Each iteration increments γi
at up to h buses, where h is a speciﬁed parameter, that have
the largest mismatches Smis
among all buses satisfying two
conditions: 1.) γi < γmax and 2.) Smis
i > ǫ, where ǫ is a
speciﬁed mismatch tolerance. If no buses satisfy both of these

7Note that γmax is not a speciﬁed maximum but can change at each iteration.

conditions, increment γi at up to h buses with the largest Smis
greater than the speciﬁed tolerance and increment γmax. That
is, in order to avoid unnecessarily increasing the size of the
positive semideﬁnite matrices, the heuristic avoids increment-
ing the maximum relaxation order γmax until γi = γmax at
all buses with mismatch Smis
i > ǫ. The algorithm terminates

when (cid:12)(cid:12)Smis

lute value, which indicates satisfaction of the rank condition
for practical purposes. Thus, the relaxations are successively
tightened in a manner that preserves computational tractability.

IV. COMPUTATIONAL STUDY OF THE PARAMETER IN THE

SPARSITY-EXPLOITING ALGORITHM

There is a computational trade-off in choosing the value
of h. Larger values of h may result in fewer iterations of
the algorithm but each iteration is slower if more buses than
necessary have high-order relaxations. Smaller values of h
result in faster solution at each iteration, but may require more
iterations. Previous work [12], [19], [20] chose h = 2 based
on limited computational experience. This section presents a
more comprehensive study of the impact of this parameter.

In theory, the choice of h has no impact on the eventual
convergence of the hierarchies. With sufﬁciently small toler-
ance ǫ, Algorithm 1 eventually proceeds to build the complete
hierarchies. Thus, Algorithm 1 inherits the theoretical conver-
gence guarantees for MSOSγ-R and MSOSγ-C. In practice,
the choice of h signiﬁcantly affects the computational require-
ments, and thus the practical capabilities of the hierarchies.

To study the impact of the parameter h on solution times,
we solved both MSOSγ-R and MSOSγ-C for large OPF
problems representing Poland (PL) [21] and other European
networks from the PEGASE project [22] for which the ﬁrst-
order relaxation fails to yield the globally optimal decision
variables. The hierarchies as presented in this paper have
difﬁculty solving test cases that minimize generation costs, due
to the need for higher-order constraints at many buses.8 We
therefore chose to minimize active power losses; the relaxation
hierarchies globally solve these problems with higher-order
constraints at only a few buses.

The low-impedance line preprocessing method in [20] with
a threshold of 1 × 10−3 per unit for the Polish systems and
3 × 10−3 per unit for the PEGASE systems was used to
improve numerical convergence. To further improve numerical
convergence and computational speed, we did not enforce the
sphere constraint for MSOSγ-C. Low-order relaxations from
the complex hierarchy converged for the test cases considered
here despite the lack of a convergence guarantee in the absence
of the sphere constraint [12]. Bounds on the lifted variables y
and ˆy derived from the voltage magnitude limits (1d) are also
enforced to improve numeric convergence.

The relaxations were implemented using MATLAB 2013a,
YALMIP 2015.06.26 [26], and Mosek 7.1.0.28 and were
solved using a computer with a quad-core 2.70 GHz processor

8For problems that minimize generation cost, see [20] for a related approach

that ﬁnds feasible points with objective values near the global optimum.

and 16 GB of RAM. The results do not include the typically
small formulation times. We used a tolerance ǫ = 1 MVA.

Figure 1 shows a plot of the solver times for the large test
cases vs. h. In order to match previous results [12], [19], [20],
the values in Figure 1 are normalized such that a value of one
represents the solution time for the real hierarchy with h = 2.9
The solver times for the real hierarchy with h = 2 are 571,
2610, 261, 339, 351, and 806 seconds for the systems in the
order shown in the legend of Figure 1. Figure 2 shows a plot
of the number of iterations of Algorithm 1 vs. h.

These results demonstrate that the complex hierarchy is
generally faster than the real hierarchy for a range of values
of h despite sometimes requiring more iterations. This is
expected due to the smaller matrices in the complex hierarchy.

9A maximum solver time of two hours was enforced. Any convergence
failures (e.g., insufﬁcient memory) are assigned this maximum solver time.
Solver times are reported as the mean time from three MOSEK solves.

Averaged over all test cases and choices of h, the complex
hierarchy was a factor of 9.2 faster than the real hierarchy.

The computational challenges of MSOSγ-R are most appar-
ent when Algorithm 1 increases γi for buses that are contained
within large cliques, which correspond to large matrices. For
instance, PEGASE-1354 with h = 7 results in second-order
relaxation constraints for a clique with ten buses and a solver
time of 4112 seconds for this iteration of Algorithm 1. This
motivates future work in developing a more sophisticated algo-
rithm that considers the size of the corresponding matrix rather
than just the power injection mismatch when determining how
to increment γi. This example also demonstrates the signiﬁcant
advantages of the complex hierarchy, for which global solution
with the same set of higher-order buses only requires 89
seconds. With smaller matrices associated with the higher-
order constraints, the complex hierarchy is also generally less
sensitive to the parameter h than the real hierarchy.

Figure 2 numerically demonstrates the expected trade-off
related to h: with more higher-order constraints added each
iteration, there are generally fewer iterations required but more
time per iteration. The number of iterations quickly decreases
but ﬂattens out when h ≈ 4. This ﬂattening indicates a
saturation in the beneﬁt associated with adding more higher-
order constraints at each iteration. For the loss minimization
test cases, the average solver time results suggest that good
values of h are 7 for MSOSγ-C and 4 for MSOSγ-R.

The results may be sensitive to the test cases and im-
plementation details. Future work includes studying re-
lated hierarchies (e.g., alternatives to Algorithm 1,
the
“moment+penalization” approach in [20], and the mixed
SDP/SOCP hierarchy in [27]) as well as other means of
tightening the relaxations (e.g., the valid inequalities in [8]).
Leveraging efforts in test case development [28], future work
also includes extending this study using additional test cases.

V. CONCLUSION

This paper presented two hierarchies of convex relax-
ations for globally solving OPF problems. The real hierar-
chy MSOSγ-R has been successfully applied to OPF prob-
lems in several previous works, while the complex hierarchy
MSOSγ-C has only recently been introduced. After summariz-
ing and comparing these hierarchies, we discussed an iterative
method for exploiting sparsity and selectively applying com-
putationally intensive higher-order relaxation constraints using
a “power injection mismatch” approach to identify problematic
buses. This approach requires a single parameter h deﬁning
the maximum number of buses that are assigned higher-order
constraints at each iteration of the algorithm. We presented
numerical experiments using several large OPF problems to
identify the impact of different choices for h.
