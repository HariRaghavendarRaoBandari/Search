According to the Particle Data Group, the measurements of B(W + → τ +ντ ) and B(W + → ℓ+νℓ)
(ℓ = e, µ) disagree with one another at the 2.3σ level. In this paper, we search for a new-physics
(NP) explanation of this W → τ ν puzzle. We consider two NP scenarios: (i) the W mixes with a W ′
boson that couples preferentially to the third generation, (ii) τL,R and ντ L mix with isospin-triplet
leptons. Unfortunately, once other experimental constraints are taken into account, neither scenario
can explain the above experimental result. Our conclusion is that the W → τ ν puzzle is almost
certainly just a statistical ﬂuctuation.

INTRODUCTION

At present, there are a few measurements that are in potential disagreement with the predictions of the standard
model (SM) of particle physics. One hint of lepton non-universality involves the leptonic decays of the W . According
to the Particle Data Group [1], we have

yielding

B(W + → e+νe) = (10.71 ± 0.16)% ,
B(W + → µ+νµ) = (10.63 ± 0.15)% ,
B(W + → τ +ντ ) = (11.38 ± 0.21)% ,

2B(W + → τ +ντ )

B(W + → e+νe) + B(W + → µ+νµ)

= 1.067 ± 0.029 .

(2)

The SM prediction for this ratio is 0.999 to a very good approximation, so there is a diﬀerence at the level of 2.3σ.
We refer to this as the “W → τ ν puzzle.” Of course, this could simply be a statistical ﬂuctuation. But could it in
fact be due to the presence of new physics (NP)?
In the past, the only theoretical studies that attempted to directly address the W → τ ν puzzle involved models
with two Higgs doublets. Speciﬁcally, it was suggested that the excess in W → τ ν events is due to contamination
by a light charged Higgs, with mass mW , decaying via H + → τ +ντ [2]. However, recently the data of the four LEP
collaborations was combined and a search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons was performed [3]. No signiﬁcant
excess of τ +ντ ﬁnal states was observed compared to the SM background, so that a lower limit can be set on the mass
of the charged Higgs as a function of the H + → τ +ντ branching ratio. While the LEP study does not completely
rule out two-Higgs-doublet models with the most general couplings, it does severely restrict the available parameter
space [4].

An alternative explanation of the puzzle is that the W -τ -ντ coupling is itself increased. Furthermore, as we show
below, a larger coupling can also improve some other discrepancies with the SM. Below we discuss several other
measurements that are sensitive to the W -τ -ντ coupling. It should be noted that, while Eq. 1 is a direct measurement
of the W -τ -ντ coupling, these other measurements are indirect probes of this coupling, and there may be other
new-physics contributions to these decays [5].

Consider ﬁrst the decay B+ → τ +ντ . Its branching ratio is [1]

B(B+ → τ +ντ ) = (1.14 ± 0.27) × 10−4 ,

Here the FLAG average fB = (190.5 ± 4.2) MeV [7] and the CKMﬁtter result |Vub| = (3.55 ± 0.16) × 10−3 [8] have
been used. From the above numbers, we see that there is a small (1.5σ) disagreement between the measurement and
the SM prediction. It is stressed in Ref. [6] that the size of the disagreement depends on the value taken for |Vub|, and
there is a long-standing discrepancy between the determinations of |Vub| from inclusive B → Xuℓ+ν and exclusive
¯B → M ℓ¯ν decays [1]. Indeed, if the inclusive value for |Vub| is used, the disagreement disappears. Still, if the SM
prediction of Eq. (4) holds, the agreement with experiment can be improved if the W -τ -ντ coupling is increased.

(6)

Due to the large experimental error on RDs, there is no discrepancy with the SM, but, at the 3σ level, a 10% increase
in the W -τ -ντ coupling is allowed. This measurement is thus consistent with that of Eq. (1).

τ decays would obviously be aﬀected by a change in the W -τ -ντ coupling. Consider ﬁrst τ − → e−ντ ¯νe. Here the

SM predicts [1]

where τi represents the mean lifetime of particle i. The experimental value for the above ratio is

(8)
assuming the branching ratio for the µ decay is ≈ 100% [1]. This τ decay channel therefore allows very little (less
than a percent) change in the W -τ -ντ coupling.

Rτ ≈ (17.83 ± 0.04)% ,

A second decay is τ − → π−ντ . In the SM, the branching ratio for this decay can be expressed as [9]

(9)
Here δτ /π represents the small radiative corrections to the decay rate; it is known very well: δτ /π = 1.0016±0.0014 [10].
Above we have used the FLAG average fπ = (130.2±1.4) MeV [7] and the CKMﬁtter result |Vud| = (0.97425±0.00022)
[8]. (The biggest source of the ∼ 2% error in the predicted branching ratio is the lattice value for fπ which has a
∼ 1% error.) The prediction in Eq. (9) should be compared with the measured value [1]

= (10.67 ± 0.23)% .

B(τ − → π−ντ ) = (10.91 ± 0.07)% .

(10)

In this case the predicted value has a larger error than the measured value and they are consistent with each other.
Still, if we allow for a 3σ (upward) deviation from the measured value and trust the predicted central value, we ﬁnd
that a 2% increase in the W -τ -ντ coupling is allowed. Also, it must be remembered that this decay can be aﬀected
by other new-physics contributions [11].
Finally, there are the charged-current decays ¯B → D(∗)+ℓ− ¯νℓ, which have been measured by the BaBar [12], Belle
[13] and LHCb [14] Collaborations. It is found that the values of the ratios B( ¯B → D(∗)+τ − ¯ντ )/B( ¯B → D(∗)+ℓ− ¯νℓ)
(ℓ = e, µ) considerably exceed their SM predictions. The experimental results and theoretical predictions can be
combined to yield [15]

RD ≡ B( ¯B → D+τ − ¯ντ )exp/B( ¯B → D+τ − ¯ντ )SM
B( ¯B → D+ℓ−¯νℓ)exp/B( ¯B → D+ℓ− ¯νℓ)SM
RD∗ ≡ B( ¯B → D∗+τ − ¯ντ )exp/B( ¯B → D∗+τ − ¯ντ )SM
B( ¯B → D∗+ℓ−¯νℓ)exp/B( ¯B → D∗+ℓ− ¯νℓ)SM

= 1.37 ± 0.18 ,

= 1.28 ± 0.08 .

(11)

3

The measured values of RD and RD∗ represent deviations from the SM of 2.0σ and 3.8σ, respectively. This is the
RD(∗) puzzle. In this case, the discrepancies with the SM are too large to be explained entirely by an increase in
the W -τ -ντ coupling. Even so, such an increase would lead to larger theoretical predictions for B( ¯B → D(∗)+τ − ¯ντ ),
which would reduce the disagreement with experiment.
We therefore see that an increased W -τ -ντ coupling can explain the W → τ ν puzzle, and can also improve other
discrepancies with the SM. (It must also be conceded that not all measurements support the idea of an increased
coupling.) The purpose of this paper is to attempt to ﬁnd a NP model in which the W -τ -ντ coupling can be made
larger.

To this end we consider two NP possibilities. In the ﬁrst, we assume that a W ′ boson exists that couples preferentially
to the third generation. The mixing of this W ′ with the SM W could then lead to an increased W -τ -ντ coupling. In
the second, we allow the τL,R and ντ L to mix with isospin-triplet leptons. Once again, this mixing could generate
a larger W -τ -ντ coupling. Unfortunately, as we will see, once constraints from other measurements are taken into
account, neither NP scenario can reproduce the measured W -τ -ντ coupling. Because of the diﬃculty in ﬁnding a
reasonably simple NP explanation, we are forced to conclude that the W → τ ν puzzle is probably just a statistical
ﬂuctuation.
We begin in Sec. 2 with an evaluation of the potential for W -W ′ mixing to lead to an increased W -τ -ντ coupling
once all experimental constraints are taken into account. This analysis is repeated in Sec. 3 for the mixing of the τL,R
and ντ L with isospin-triplet leptons. (The details of the formalism of this mixing are given in the Appendix.) We
conclude in Sec. 4.

II. W -W ′ MIXING

There has been another recent hint of lepton non-universality. The LHCb Collaboration measured the ratio of
decay rates for B+ → K +ℓ+ℓ− (ℓ = e, µ) in the dilepton invariant mass-squared range 1 GeV2 ≤ q2 ≤ 6 GeV2 [16],
and found

RK ≡ B(B+ → K +µ+µ−)
B(B+ → K +e+e−)

= 0.745+0.090

(12)
This diﬀers from the SM prediction of RK = 1±O(10−4) [17] by 2.6σ. A NP explanation of this RK puzzle was oﬀered
in Ref. [18]. Here the NP is assumed to couple preferentially to the third generation, giving rise to the operator1

transforms to the mass basis, this generates the operator (¯bLγµsL)(¯µLγµµL) that contributes to ¯b → ¯sµ+µ−. (There
is also a contribution to ¯b → ¯se+e−, but it is much smaller.)
In Ref. [21], it was pointed out that, assuming the scale of NP is much larger than the weak scale, the operator of
Eq. (13) should be made invariant under the full SU (3)C × SU (2)L × U (1)Y gauge group. One way to do this is to
write the NP operator as

current (NC) and charged-current (CC) interactions. The NC and CC pieces can be used to respectively explain the
RK and RD(∗) puzzles. One NP model that contains the above operator involves vector leptoquarks [22]. Another
assumes the addition of a set of massive vector bosons that transform as an SU (2)L triplet, and that are coupled to
both quark and lepton currents [15]. It is this second NP model that is of interest for the W → τ ν puzzle.

In Ref. [23], a formalism was presented for adding to the SM a real spin-1 isospin-triplet V a

angular distributions measured by LHCb [20].

In Ref. [15] it was shown that tree-level Z ′ and W ′

It is emphasized in Ref. [23] that the V a

µ ﬁelds in Eq. (15) are not the mass eigenstates as they mix with the W a
µ

after electroweak symmetry breaking. In particular, the physical W mass eigenstate is

(W ±)phys = W ± cos θC + V ± sin θC ,

(16)

where θC is the charged-current mixing angle. Naively, this angle could be as large as O(mW /mV ), which equals 0.08
for mV = 1 TeV. In the presence of such mixing, the W -τ -ντ coupling is given by

g(cos θC + (gl/g)λl

33 sin θC ) .

(17)

The experimental measurement of the W -τ -ντ coupling could therefore be reproduced if the expression in parentheses
equals 1.033. Given that λl

33 = 1, this could happen if, for example,

gl = g ,

θC = 0.034 .

(18)

On the face of things, this appears to be possible. However, constraints from the neutral-current sector must be

taken into account. In the presence of mixing, the physical Z mass eigenstate is given by

The key point [23] is that, for small mixing angles,

(Z 0)phys = Z 0 cos θN + V 0 sin θN .

(19)

(20)

Thus, constraints on θN lead directly to constraints on θC . And θN can be bounded by the data on Z decays. For
example, consider Z → τ +τ −. The Z → ℓ+ℓ− data are [1]

B(Z → e+e−) = (3.363 ± 0.004)% ,
B(Z → µ+µ−) = (3.366 ± 0.007)% ,
B(Z → τ +τ −) = (3.370 ± 0.008)% ,

leading to

Theoretically, we have

This corresponds to the constraint θC < 0.0015, which rules out the solution of Eq. (18).

We note in passing that a similar result can be found by considering Z → ντ ¯ντ decays. In the SM,

This corresponds to the constraint θC < 0.004. This is weaker than that from Z → τ +τ −, but it still rules out the
solution of Eq. (18).

We therefore conclude that the W → τ ν puzzle cannot be explained by W -W ′ mixing.

III. MIXING WITH ISOSPIN-TRIPLET LEPTONS

In this section we consider the mixing of τL,R and ντ L with isospin-triplet leptons. Such exotic leptons were
examined in Ref. [24], and were allowed to mix with all three ﬂavors of SM leptons. This then generates ﬂavor-
changing neutral-current processes (FCNCs) such as µ → eγ, τ → µµµ, etc. Ref. [24] focused speciﬁcally on FCNCs,
as well as on the phenomenology of the exotic leptons.
In the present paper, the isospin-triplet leptons are allowed to mix with only one ﬂavor of SM leptons, τ and ντ , so
that FCNCs are not generated. Thus, only ﬂavor-conserving processes (such as W → τ ν) are aﬀected. Now, if the
new leptons with which τL and ντ L mix were singlets under SU (2)L, the W -τ -ν coupling would be reduced (by the
cosine of the mixing angle) [25]. However, as we show below, if the exotic leptons are isospin triplets, this coupling
can be increased.

We consider two types of isospin triplets:

LL,R ≡

L+
L0

L− 
L,R

,

L′

L,R ≡


L′0

L,R

L has hypercharge Y = 0 and is Majorana; L′ has hypercharge Y = −2 and is Dirac. Both are vector fermions, i.e.,
their L and R chiralities are both isospin triplets. As shown in the Appendix [Eq. (60)], since L(′) is an isotriplet, the
charged-current interactions between L(′)0 and L(′)− take the form

.

(36)

Compare this to the SM charged-current interaction terms:

It is the diﬀerent coeﬃcients – 1/√2 for isospin doublets, 1 for isospin triplets – that has the potential to produce an
increased W -τ -ν coupling.

The basic idea is as follows. The SM fermions are

τ − (cid:19)L

L have components with Qem = −1 (L(′)−

the expression in parentheses equals 1.033. This could happen if, for example,

L = 0.28 .

(42)

One immediate question is: Theoretically, can such large mixing be obtained? In the case of mixing with isotriplet
leptons, the answer is yes. Because both EL and the SM Higgs are doublets under SU (2)L, and because 2⊗ 2 = 1⊕ 3,
one can write dimension-four operators that involve EL, H and L(′). When the Higgs acquires a vacuum expectation
value (VEV) v/√2, it generates a mass term mixing EL and L(′). This mass term m is naturally of O(v). Assuming
the exotic leptons have masses M ≃ O(1 TeV), the mixing angle will be O(m/M ). This is in the right ballpark of the
above angle.
On the other hand, this would not work if τL,R and ντ L mix with exotic leptons of higher isospin. In this case,
higher-dimension operators involving more than one Higgs ﬁeld are required. These are suppressed by powers of the
NP mass scale, and so the mixing angles will be correspondingly reduced.

We therefore see that the mixing of τL,R and ντ L with exotic isotriplet leptons has the potential to explain the
W → τ ν puzzle. But this raises further questions. Is such mixing consistent with other experimental constraints?
If not, are there any mixing scenarios, even ﬁne-tuned, in which this can be made to work? To investigate these
questions, we consider four diﬀerent models involving the mixing of τL,R and ντ L with isotriplet leptons:

(i) mixing with L′ alone,
(ii) mixing with L alone,
(iii) mixing with L and L′,
(iv) mixing with L, L′ and ντ R.

For a given model to pass all the experimental tests, it must (1) give the correct value of mν , (2) reproduce the
measured value of the W -τ -ντ coupling, (3) satisfy the constraints from Z → τ +τ − and Z → ντ ¯ντ . Regarding test

(1), we know that ντ has a tiny mass, and there are neutrino oscillations. However, as can be seen in the Appendix,
the nonzero entries in the neutrino mass matrices are all O(v) or O(1 TeV). As such, there is no way of implementing a
seesaw mechanism, which requires a mass term of O(1015 GeV). For this reason we require only that a model contain
a massless neutrino in order to pass test (1). If a possible solution to the W → τ ν puzzle is found, we can then try to
explain neutrino masses and oscillations by allowing all three neutrinos to mix and incorporating some sort of seesaw
mechanism. However, for now we are content to focus on massless neutrinos.

7

Models (i)-(iv) are analyzed in detail in the Appendix. In all cases, we ﬁrst examine the mass matrix of the neutral
leptons, to see if the model passes test (1), i.e., if it predicts a tiny mass or m = 0 for ντ . We ﬁnd that models (ii)
and (iii) fail this test. However, models (i) and (iv) do contain ντ with m = 0. For these models, we express (ντ L)phys
and (τ −

L,R)phys in terms of the gauge eigenstates. This allows us to move on to tests (2) and (3).

Consider ﬁrst model (i). Here the τ −

That is, they are of opposite sign2. Since the correction to the W -τ -ντ coupling is proportional to sin θτ
actually has the eﬀect of decreasing the coupling. Model (i) thus fails test (2).

For completeness, how does model (i) fare with test (3)? First, consider Z → τ +τ − [see Eqs. (21)-(24)]. In the

presence of mixing, the I3L of the physical τ −

Following Eq. (41), it was noted that this quantity should equal 1.033 to explain W → τ ν puzzle. This is clearly not
satisﬁed by the above equation. Thus, even if the sign diﬀerence of Eq. (43) had not been present, model (i) could
not have passed test (2). Conversely, taking values for the mixing angles large enough to explain W → τ ν puzzle
would have resulted in failing test (3). The bottom line is that model (i) does not pass the experimental tests.

2 This sign diﬀerence is due to the opposite signs of the m′

2 entries in the neutral- and charged-lepton mass matrices [Eqs. (65) and (66)].
And this is in turn due to fact that the 12 and 22 elements of the 2 × 2 representation of L′ [Eq. (64)], which contribute to the mass
matrices, are of opposite sign.

We now turn to model (iv). Here the mixing is much more complicated. The expressions for (ντ L)phys and (τ −

L,R)phys

are given in Eqs. (72) and (75), and are repeated for convenience below:

In both cases above, we have expanded the expressions for the coeﬃcients, neglecting mτ and keeping terms to leading

from the decays Z → τ +τ − and Z → ντ ¯ντ are quite severe. To evade these constraints, the mass parameters in
model (iv) must be such that the values of I3L of both (τ −

Above, it was noted that η = 3 is required to evade the constraints from Z → τ +τ − and Z → ντ ¯ντ . However, if
η ≥ 1, we have K < 1, so that, as was the case with model (i), mixing has the eﬀect of reducing the W -τ -ντ coupling.
Thus, although the model passes test (3), it now fails test (2). We therefore conclude that the W → τ ν puzzle cannot
be explained by allowing τL,R and ντ L to mix with isospin-triplet leptons.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

At present, there are several measurements of B decays that exhibit discrepancies with the predictions of the SM
at the level of 2σ or greater. These hints of new physics have been taken very seriously – there has been a ﬂurry
of theoretical activity looking for NP explanations of the various B-decay results. Another decay that has a similar
disagreement with the SM is W → τ ν. According to the Particle Data Group, there is a 2.3σ disagreement between

9

B(W + → τ +ντ ) and B(W + → ℓ+νℓ) (ℓ = e, µ). However, for some reason – perhaps because τ − → e−ντ ¯νe does not
exhibit a similar discrepancy with the SM – little attention has been paid to this result. In the present paper, we
search for a NP explanation of the W → τ ν puzzle.
The obvious conclusion to be drawn from the experimental measurement is that the W -τ -ντ coupling has been
increased due to the presence of NP. Because the process is rather simple – an on-shell W decaying to τ ν – there are
only two possible ways NP can enter. Either the W mixes with a W ′, or the τL and ντ L mix with exotic leptons. We
consider both possibilities.

First, we assume that a W ′ boson exists that couples preferentially to the third generation. W -W ′ mixing could
then lead to an increased W -τ -ντ coupling. The problem is that such a W ′ also comes with a neutral partner, a Z ′,
that mixes with the SM Z. Now, the amount of W -W ′ and Z-Z ′ mixing are related. And Z-Z ′ mixing is strongly
constrained by the experimental measurements of Z → τ +τ − and Z → ντ ¯ντ . The upshot is that, when the constraints
from Z decays are taken into account, the allowed W -W ′ mixing is too small to produce the necessary increase in the
W -τ -ντ coupling.

Second, we allow τL,R and ντ L to mix with isospin-triplet leptons. Such mixing can potentially lead to an increased
W -τ -ντ coupling. We take two isospin-triplet leptons, one with hypercharge Y = 0, the other with Y = −2, and
consider a variety of mixing scenarios. For a given scenario to succeed, it must (1) give the correct value of mντ
(m = 0 is allowed), (2) reproduce the measured value of the W -τ -ντ coupling, and (3) satisfy the constraints from
Z → τ +τ − and Z → ντ ¯ντ . Unfortunately, all the mixing scenarios fail at least one of these tests.
certainly just a statistical ﬂuctuation.

Because we are unable to ﬁnd a NP explanation of the W → τ ν puzzle, we are forced to conclude that it is almost

L and L′ have hypercharge Y = 0 and Y = −2, respectively. Both are vector fermions, i.e., their L and R chiralities
are both isospin triplets. For this reason, they may have direct mass terms. However, L is Majorana, while L′ is
Dirac, which means that the forms of the mass terms and mass matrices are diﬀerent. The kinetic and direct mass

the form of the SU(2) generators (T ±, T3) depends on whether the the fermion is an isodoublet or an isotriplet. In

Below we examine four diﬀerent models: τL,R and ντ L mixing with (i) L′ alone, (ii) L alone, (iii) L and L′, (iv) L,
L′ and ντ R. If a given model does not contain a neutrino with a tiny mass (m = 0 is accepted), it is excluded from
further consideration. If it passes this test, we ﬁnd the eigenvectors corresponding to (τL,R)phys and (ντ L)phys.

The states in Eqs. (65) and (66) are deﬁned in the gauge basis. To transform to the mass basis one applies the
unitary transformations UL and UR on the left-handed and right-handed states, respectively. UL (UR) diagonalizes
MM† (M†M). In the present case, since the mass matrices are real, the transformation matrices are orthogonal,
OL and OR. The diagonalization of the mass matrices yields the mass eigenvalues and the decomposition of the mass
eigenstates in terms of gauge eigenstates.

For the neutral leptons, this procedure is rather simple. The mass eigenvalues are m = 0 and m = qm′

The eigenstate that has m = 0 is given by Eq. (40), with

Turning to the charged-lepton mass matrix, we assume that the lighter of the two eigenvalues is the physical τ -lepton

The mass eigenvalues for the neutral leptons are obtained by diagonalizing MνL. Approximately, these are m =
−m2
2/4M and m = M/2. However, we see immediately that this is problematic. Given that m2 is O(v) and M is
O(1 TeV), the light neutrino mass m2
2/4M is orders of magnitude too large. We therefore conclude that the model in
which τL,R and ντ L mix with L alone is not viable.

Now, the determinant of the diagonalized matrix – which is just the product of the four mass eigenvalues – is equal

to the determinant of the above mass matrix. However, Det(MνLL′) = m2
matrix does not yield an m = 0 eigenvalue. Furthermore, since m2 and m′
2 are O(v), while M and M ′ are O(1 TeV),
there is no possibility of a seesaw mechanism. It is therefore not possible to generate a tiny mass for ντ , which rules
out the model in which τL,R and ντ L mix with L and L′.

mD, m2 and m′

2 are O(v), while M and M ′ are O(1 TeV). However, the size of mS is as yet undetermined.

If mS were O(1015 GeV), it might be possible to generate a tiny mass of O(v2/mS) for ντ via the seesaw mechanism.
In order to establish whether this is possible, it is necessary to diagonalize MννLL′. However, this involves solving a
quintic equation, which cannot be done analytically. Still, we can get some information about the mass eigenvalues as
follows. First, we know that mD, m2 and m′
2 are less than M and M ′. In the limit where these entries are neglected, the
mass eigenvalues are 0, mS/2, M/2, M ′/2 and −M ′/2, i.e., there are three intermediate mass eigenvalues of O(1 TeV).
When mD, m2 and m′
2 are included, the values of these eigenvalues will be modiﬁed. However, we do not expect them
to change enormously – perhaps a multiplicative factor of 10±1 is possible. Second, the determinant of the diagonalized
matrix – which is just the product of the ﬁve mass eigenvalues – is equal to Det(MννLL′) = M ′2(2M m2
2mS)/64.
If mS is O(1015 GeV), this is O(1024 GeV5). Given that mντ = O(v2/mS) ∼ 10−11 GeV, this implies that the product
of the three intermediate mass eigenvalues is O(1020 GeV3). However, as we argued above, this is many orders of
magnitude larger than what is possible with MννLL′. A seesaw mechanism can therefore not be implemented.
It is still possible to generate a neutrino mass eigenvalue m = 0 if 2M m2
sizes of mD, m2 and M , a simple choice that satisﬁes this condition is m2
This is clearly a ﬁne-tuned solution, but we cannot overlook any possibilities. For this solution, we have

2mS = 0. Keeping in mind the expected
2/(2M 2) with η = −M/ms > 0.
