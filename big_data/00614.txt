We propose a realization of the electric-ﬁeld-induced antiferromagnetic resonance. We consider three-
dimensional antiferromagnetic insulators with spin-orbit coupling characterized by the existence of a topological
term called the θ term. By solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the presence of the θ term, we show
that, in contrast to conventional methods using ac magnetic ﬁelds, the antiferromagnetic resonance state is re-
alized by ac electric ﬁelds along with static magnetic ﬁelds. This mechanism can be understood as the inverse
process of the dynamical chiral magnetic eﬀect, an alternating current generation by magnetic ﬁelds. In other
words, we propose a way to electrically induce the dynamical axion ﬁeld in condensed matter. We discuss a pos-
sible experiment to observe our proposal, which utilizes the spin pumping from the antiferromagnetic insulator
into a heavy metal contact.

Introduction.— Possible applications of materials in which
the low-energy eﬀective models are described by relativis-
tic Dirac fermions have been studied intensively and exten-
sively. The representative examples of Dirac fermion sys-
tems are graphene [1] and topological insulators [2–4]. Stud-
ies on topological phases of matter are now extended to vari-
ous gapless topological phases such as Weyl semimetals [5–9]
and Dirac semimetals [10–13]. Unlike graphene, topological
phases are realized in spin-orbit coupled systems. It has been
revealed that strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a key ele-
ment in unconventional phenomena. For example, the spin-
momentum locking, which is realized in the metallic surface
states of three-dimensional topological insulators, arises as a
consequence of SOC and results in a persistent pure spin cur-
rent on the surface that is robust against disorder [2–4]. Re-
cently, possible ways to manipulate and utilize such topolog-
ical surface states have been investigated experimentally in
spintronics [14–17]. Another interesting example is the chi-
ral magnetic eﬀect, which was originally proposed in high-
energy theory as a direct current generation by static magnetic
ﬁelds [18]. Its possibility has been investigated theoretically
in Weyl semimetals [19–24], and the dynamical realization of
the chiral magnetic eﬀect, i.e., an alternating current genera-
tion by magnetic ﬁelds, has also been proposed in spin-orbit
coupled insulators [25].

One of the most important themes in spintronics is the gen-
eration and control of spin currents. Spin pumping is a pow-
erful technique to generate a pure spin current [26–28]. While
a magnetization is precessing, the spin angular momentum in
a magnet is injected across the interface into a neighboring
material through the exchange interaction. The spin current
injected into a heavy metal (HM) such as Pt can be detected
electrically via the inverse spin Hall eﬀect [27, 29, 30]. So far,
ferromagnets have been used as a source material in which
magnetization precession is caused for spin pumping. On
the other hand, unlike ferromagnets, antiferromagnets had not
been considered to be of practical use due to zero net mag-
netization. However, recent studies in spintronics is now ex-
tended to active use of antiferromagnets [31–35]. It has been
suggested that antiferromagnets can complement or replace

ferromagnets as active elements of a memory [36] or logic
device [37], e.g., because antiferromagnets do not generate
unwanted stray ﬁelds.

In this paper, we propose a realization of the electrically
driven antiferromagnetic (AF) resonance in three-dimensional
AF insulators with SOC. This is in sharp contrast to conven-
tional methods using magnetic ﬁelds. In spintronics, electri-
cal manipulation of magnetism is one of the most important
subjects in the pursuit of energy-saving and higher-density
information storage. However, preceding studies have been
based on electric-current-induced methods that require such
high-density currents as ∼ 1010 A/m2 [38]. Namely, there
is a large energy dissipation due to Joule heat. In contrast,
since the system we consider is insulating, there is no en-
ergy dissipation due to Joule heat in the presence of elec-
tric ﬁelds. Moreover, whereas the electric-ﬁeld-induced fer-
romagnetic resonance has been realized experimentally in a
ferromagnetic metal [39], the electric-ﬁeld-induced AF reso-
nance has not yet been realized. The key ingredient for its
realization in our study is a topological term called the θ term
which arises due to strong SOC. The existence of the θ term
leads to a coupling of electric ﬁelds and the N´eel ﬁeld. By
solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the presence
of the θ term, we show that the AF resonance state is realized
by ac electric ﬁelds. We also show that the resonance state can
be detected as an usual spin-pumping-induced voltage signal.
We argue that the mechanism of the electric-ﬁeld-induced AF
resonance in this study can be understood as the inverse pro-
cess of the dynamical chiral magnetic eﬀect [25].

Low-energy eﬀective model.— We study a class of three-
dimensional AF insulators that can be realized in systems with
electron correlations and SOC, such as 5d transition metal ox-
ides [40, 41]. As a theoretical model, we adopt a tight-binding
model called the Fu-Kane-Mele-Hubbard model on a dia-
mond lattice [25, 42], in which the nearest-neighbor electron
hopping, spin-dependent next-nearest-neighbor electron hop-
ping (i.e., SOC), and on-site electron-electron repulsive inter-
action are taken into account. In this model, an AF insulator
phase develops when on-site interactions are strong. Here, the
mean-ﬁeld AF order parameter is parameterized between the

two sublattices as (n0 sin θ cos ϕ, n0 sin θ sin ϕ, n0 cos θ), with
n0 the magnitude of the order parameter, and angles θ and ϕ
obtained from the coordinate of a diamond lattice [42].

The mean-ﬁeld low-energy eﬀective action of the system in
the presence of an external electromagnetic ﬁeld is given by a
massive Dirac fermion model of the form [25, 42]

M0 is a mass term (band gap) induced by strong SOC, and
preserves time-reversal and inversion symmetries. iγ5M5 f is a
mean-ﬁeld mass term induced by the AF ordering of itinerant
electrons, and breaks both time-reversal and inversion sym-
metries. M5 f are given explicitly by M5,1 = Un0n1, M5,2 =
Un0n2, and M5,3 = Un0n3, where U is the strength of on-
site electron-electron repulsive interactions, and (n1, n2, n3) =
(sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ) is the N´eel ﬁeld. Eﬀective ac-
tions similar to Eq. (1) have been obtained in the AF insulator
phases of the magnetically doped Bi2Se3 family [43] and tran-
sition metal oxides with the corundum structure [44].

Integrating out the fermionic ﬁeld ψ f , we obtain the eﬀec-
tive action in terms of the N´eel ﬁeld and an electromagnetic
ﬁeld up to the relevant lowest order in n f as S AF = S 0 + S θ
[25]. Here, S 0 is the action of the N´eel ﬁeld (i.e., the nonlinear
sigma model [45])

direction in Eq. (2) cannot be determined from Eq. (1), since
the N´eel ﬁeld is isotropic in Eq. (1).

Let us implement a little more realistic condition in the

tion m satisfying the constraint n · m = 0 with |n| = 1 and
|m| (cid:28) 1. Furthermore, we assume the case of AF insula-
tors with easy-axis anisotropy. Then a modiﬁcation of Eq. (2)
gives the free energy of the trivial part as [47, 48]

Electric-ﬁeld-induced antiferromagnetic resonance.— In
order to realize and detect the electric-ﬁeld-induced AF res-
onance, we consider the AF insulator/HM bilayer system in
the presence of an ac electric ﬁeld Eac(t) = Eaceiω0tez and a
static magnetic ﬁeld H = gµBBez (B = Bez) with B being
much weaker than both the AF exchange coupling and easy-
axial anisotropy. Here ez is the unit vector parallel to the easy
axis of the AF order. A schematic ﬁgure of our setup is shown
in Fig. 1(a). The essential point is the coupling of the N´eel
ﬁeld and an electric ﬁeld through Eq. (5). Now we study the
dynamics of m and n phenomenologically, i.e., based on the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation [48]. From the total free en-
ergy of the system FAF = F0 + Fθ, the eﬀective ﬁelds for n
and m are given by
fn = − δFAF
δn

+ ηθ(Eac · B)e[111],
= −am + n × (H × n),

(6)

fm = − δFAF
δm

where ηθ = (e2/2πh)(
3Un0/M0). Since the AF insulator
has the HM contact, in the resonance state a pure spin cur-
rent is injected into the HM layer through the interface, which
enhances the Gilbert damping constant [32]. The Landau-
Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is given by

˙n = (γfm − G1 ˙m) × n,
˙m = (γfn − G2 ˙n) × n + (γfm − G1 ˙m) × m + τSP,

(7)

√

where γ is the eﬀective gyromagnetic ratio, G1 and G2
are dimensionless Gilbert-damping parameters, and τSP =
−GSP( ˙n × n + ˙m × m) is the additional damping torque with
a spin pumping parameter GSP [32, 49].

To obtain the resonance state, where all the spins are
precessing uniformly, we assume the dynamics of the N´eel
vector and the total magnetization around the easy axis as
n(t) = ez + δn(t) and m(t) = δm(t), denoting that δn(t) and
(cid:82)
δm(t) are the small precession components (|δn|,|δm| (cid:28) 1).
After the linearization and the Fourier transform δn(t) =
δ ˜n(ω)e−iωtdω/(2π), Eq. (7) reduces to

is insulating, we are free from additional dc voltages from the
anisotropic magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall eﬀect
[53]. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the spin pumping generates a
pure dc spin current Js ﬂowing across the AF insulator/HM

rent) per unit area [26]. Its magnitude Js = |Js| is given by

the spin relaxation is included in gr

the HM. The spin current is converted into an electric voltage

One can conﬁrm the electric-ﬁeld-induced AF resonance
in this study as follows. The experimental setup we propose
is for measuring the magnetic-ﬁeld angle dependence of the
induced dc voltage in the case where the applied static mag-
netic ﬁeld B is much weaker than both the AF exchange cou-
pling and uniaxial anisotropy. In this case, the induced voltage
VSP(ω±) ∝ −(γηθEacB)2 cos2 ψ oscillates as a function of the
relative angle ψ between Eac and B. For magnetic ﬁeld ro-
tations in the x-y plane, where Eac ⊥ B, one will not ﬁnd
any electrical signals since ψ = π/2. Such a ψ dependence is
a direct consequence of the existence of the topological term
(5) which is essential for the realization of the electric-ﬁeld-
induced AF resonance in this study.

Discussions.— First, we comment on a possible realization
of our prediction in real materials. It is suggested theoretically
that the AF insulator phases, in which there exists the θ term
and the value of θ is proportional to the N´eel ﬁeld as in our
case, can be realized in the magnetically doped Bi2Se3 fam-
ily [43] and transition metal oxides with the corundum struc-
ture [44]. Recently, AF insulator phases have been observed
experimentally in GaxBi2−xSe3 [56] and CexBi2−xSe3 [57].
These could be candidate materials to observe the electric-
ﬁeld-induced AF resonance.

Next, we discuss the mechanism of the AF resonance in
this study. Recall that the presence of the θ term (3) results in

FIG. 1. (a) Schematic ﬁgure of a possible experimental setup to ob-
serve the electric-ﬁeld-induced AF resonance in our system. The
direction of the AF order (i.e., the easy axis) is deﬁned as the z di-
rection. e[111] is the unit vector along the [111] direction of the di-
amond lattice. An ac electric ﬁeld Eac(t) = Eaceiω0tez is applied to
the parallel-plate capacitor, and a static magnetic ﬁeld B = Bez is
also applied to the AF insulator. The pumped spin current Js into
the attached HM such as Pt can be detected through the inverse spin
Hall eﬀect as a direct current Jc (i.e., the voltage VSP) across the
transverse direction. (b) Schematic illustration of the spin pumping
mechanism. Spin resonance injects a pure spin current into the at-
tached layer via the exchange interaction at the interface.

where ωH = γgµBB, ωa = γa, ωK = γK, W = ωθe[111] × ez
with ωθ = γηθEacB, ω0 is the frequency of the applied ac elec-
tric ﬁeld [Eac(t) = Eaceiω0tez], and ˜G2 = G2 + GSP. It can be
shown that for τ (cid:29) /J (τ is the typical time scale of AF
dynamics and J ∝ A is the AF exchange coupling constant),
the G1 term in Eq. (7) becomes unimportant, enabling the dis-
regard of the damping term −G1 ˙m × n [50]. The resonance
frequencies are obtained as [51]

where +(−) corresponds to the excitation of the right-handed
(left-handed) mode. The uniaxial anisotropy gives a band gap,
while a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld splits the degeneracy and
creates diﬀerent dispersion relations ω+ and ω−.

Detection of the antiferromagnetic resonance.— So far we
have shown that the AF resonance can be realized by ac elec-
tric ﬁelds, which is in sharp contrast to conventional methods
using ac magnetic ﬁelds. How can we detect this electrically
driven AF resonance? Regarding its detection, we can em-
ploy a standard method. Namely we can observe the spin-
pumping-induced voltage signal in the HM layer. One of the
advantages of employing this method in our system is that we

4

this study can be understood as the inverse process of the dy-
namical chiral magnetic eﬀect. In other words, we have pro-
posed a way to electrically induce the dynamical axion ﬁeld
in condensed matter.

We can also conﬁrm this mechanism from another view-
point. As shown in Fig. 2, it is known that the θ term rep-
resents the chiral anomaly described by a triangle Feynman
diagram. In this triangle diagram, one of the three vertices is
the N´eel ﬁeld iγ5M5 f and the other two are the electromag-
netic ﬁelds eγµAµ [25]. Both the AF resonance in this study
and the dynamical chiral magnetic eﬀect are described by the
θ term. Figure 2 shows a diagrammatic comparison of these
two phenomena. In the dynamical chiral magnetic eﬀect, the
N´eel ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld are the inputs, and the elec-
tric ﬁeld is the observable. On the other hand, in the AF res-
onance state, the magnetic and electric ﬁelds are the inputs,
and the N´eel ﬁeld is the observable. Hence, we see that the
AF resonance state can be understood as the inverse process
of the dynamical chiral magnetic eﬀect.

Summary.— In summary, we have demonstrated that the
AF resonance can be realized by ac electric ﬁelds in three-
dimensional AF insulators with SOC. This is in sharp contrast
to conventional methods using ac magnetic ﬁelds. The es-
sential point is the existence of the θ term which arises as a
consequence of strong SOC. The mechanism of the AF reso-
nance in this study can be understood as the inverse process
of the dynamical chiral magnetic eﬀect. In other words, we
have proposed a way to electrically induce the dynamical ax-
ion ﬁeld in condensed matter. Also, the observation of the
electric-ﬁeld-induced AF resonance indicates the existence of
the chiral magnetic eﬀect. The spin-pumping-induced voltage
signal via the inverse spin Hall eﬀect, which is an observable
quantity to verify our prediction, is characterized by the an-
gle dependence between the applied ac electric ﬁeld and static
magnetic ﬁeld. Our study opens a new direction in possible
applications of topological materials in spintronics.

the topological magnetoelectric eﬀect (in ground states), i.e.,
an electric polarization density in the bulk is obtained as P =
(e2/2πh)θB [2–4, 46]. In the case of static magnetic ﬁelds, the
time derivative of both sides reads ˙P = (e2/2πh)˙θB. There is
no electric-ﬁeld screening since the system we consider is in-
sulating, which means that the electric polarization in the bulk
can be ﬂipped by external ac electric ﬁelds. Namely, we have
demonstrated that nonzero ˙P realized by external ac electric
ﬁelds induces nonzero ˙θ, i.e., a time dependence of the N´eel
ﬁeld n. On the other hand, a recent study has proposed a novel
phenomenon, the “dynamical chiral magnetic eﬀect” in AF in-
sulators with SOC that possess the θ term [25]. The dynamical
chiral magnetic eﬀect indicates an alternating electric current
generation by magnetic ﬁelds such that j = (e2/2πh)˙θB, and
emerges as a consequence of the realization of the dynamical
axion ﬁeld θ(t) in condensed matter. Here, nonzero ˙θ, i.e., a
time dependence of the N´eel ﬁeld n realized by external ac
magnetic ﬁelds, induces a polarization current j(= ˙P ) in the
bulk. Therefore, the electric-ﬁeld-induced AF resonance in

1. Solution of Antiferromagnetic Dynamics

Supplemental Material

Here we derive the solution of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (8) in the resonance state. Equation (8) is rewritten in the

matrix form

ω2 − ωaωK + ω2

−(cid:16)

where ωH = γgµBB, ωa = γa, ωK = γK, W = ωθe[111] × ez with ωθ = γηθEacB, ω0 is the frequency of the applied ac electric
ﬁeld [Eac(t) = Eaceiω0tez], and ˜G2 = G2 + GSP.

As in the case of ferromagnets [52], we can apply the resonance approximation after multiplying the inverse matrix from the
