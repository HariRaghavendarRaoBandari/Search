Abstract: We present a ﬁrst study of the ﬁeld spectrum on a class of negatively-curved
compact spaces: nilmanifolds or twisted tori. This is a case where analytical results can be
obtained, allowing to check numerical methods. We focus on the Kaluza-Klein expansion
of a scalar ﬁeld. The results are then applied to a toy model where a natural Dark Matter
candidate arises as a stable massive state of the bulk scalar.

1 Introduction

Particle physics models are built on the basis of both experimental results and theoretical
expectations. On the one hand one can start from a well-deﬁned high-energy theory and
try to build a low-energy eﬀective theory. A notable example is string theory which, in
its best known phase, lives in ten spacetime dimensions. Compactiﬁcation of the six extra
dimensions provides us, in principle, with a systematic way to construct eﬀective low-energy
theories in four-dimensional spacetime. Another possibility consists of starting from the
low-energy side and building intermediate theories that can then be linked to high-energy
models. Although this second approach does not have the ambition to bring a complete
solution all the way up to the Planck scale, it has the advantage of allowing the construction
of new theories beyond the Standard Model, which may be able to tackle at least some
of the present problems. A popular example has been to consider extra compact spaces
which can be large with respect to the Planck scale, leading in some cases to measurable

– 1 –

consequences at the TeV scale [1–4]. Compact manifolds studied in this setup are typically
ﬂat or positively-curved, stemming from the simple examples of the torus or the sphere.

In recent years compact negatively-curved spaces (CNS) have been put forward in
extra-dimensional models [5], but they are much less studied than positively-curved com-
pact spaces. They also appear in string theory [6–9], hence they can be connected to more
fundamental theories. The main motivation for the study of CNS is that some of their
properties are extremely interesting for realistic model building. Among them one can list:
• Zero modes of the Dirac operator are typically present in the eﬀective four dimen-
sional theory [10]. This contrasts with the case of positive curvature, as for spherical
orbifolds, where breaking of gauge invariance or background ﬁelds are needed, see for
example [11–13].

• Explanation of the hierarchy between the Planck scale and the electroweak scale,
thanks to their potentially large volume with respect to a linear size only slightly
larger than the new fundamental length scale (see for example [5]).
In particular
compact hyperbolic manifolds, which are special cases of CNS, have two length scales:
lc linked to local properties such as the curvature, and lG, related to global properties
such as the volume (which appears in the expression of the eﬀective Planck mass).
Typically large lG values correspond to large genus. The volume grows exponentially
with the ratio lG/lc, allowing a natural solution to the hierarchy problem [14].

• Typical mass spectra for the Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction of these spaces feature
a mass gap similar to the one present in Randall-Sundrum models [15], therefore
allowing for a solution to the hierarchy problem that does not require light KK
modes [14].

• When the extra compact space is negatively-curved, rather than ﬂat, the dynamics of
the very early universe alleviate standard cosmological problems, allowing to account
for the current homogeneity and ﬂatness of the universe [16–18].

• Finite volume hyperbolic manifolds of dimension greater than two have the remark-
able property of rigidity (Mostow’s theorem [19]): geometrical quantities such as the
length of its shortest closed geodesics, the volume, etc. are topological invariants. In
practice this means that once we ﬁx the volume and the curvature, there are no more
moduli [20].

Diﬀerent scenarios using these properties have been proposed for cosmology and inﬂation
(see for example [21, 22]). One striking point is the lack of detailed particle physics models
based on orbifolds of CNS. The reason is the diﬃculty in obtaining detailed predictions for
the spectra of these models: for example the Laplacian eigenmodes of a generic compact
hyperbolic manifold cannot be obtained in closed analytic form, thus the spectra must be
sought by means of expensive numerical methods [23–25].

We shall therefore focus here on the study of a speciﬁc case which allows analytical
control of the spectra and their KK reductions: twisted tori, compact manifolds built as

– 2 –

non-trivial ﬁbrations of tori over tori. They can be constructed from solvable (Lie) algebras
and related groups, hence their mathematical name of solvmanifolds. Nilpotent algebras
and groups are subcases thereof, from which one gets nilmanifolds. For the latter, the Ricci
scalar is always negative; this also holds for most of the solvmanifolds. We have therefore
at hand simple and calculable examples of CNS. Reviews on nil- and solvmanifolds can
be found in [26–29]. Here, we will consider the unique three-dimensional nilmanifold M3
(apart from the torus T 3), built from the Heisenberg algebra, and we will determine the
Laplacian scalar spectrum, both analytically and numerically.

Twisted tori have played an important role in compactiﬁcations of string theory and
supergravity down to four dimensions. Used as six-dimensional internal manifolds, they
appear for instance in ten-dimensional vacua of type II supergravities. The ﬁrst example
of such a supersymmetric ﬂux vacuum was found in [30] on a four-dimensional Minkowski
spacetime times M3 × T 3. Many more have been found since, as e.g.
in [26] (see [31]
for a review). M3 also appeared as part of the internal manifold in the ﬁrst example of
axion monodromy inﬂation mechanism [32] (see [33, 34] on the ten-dimensional comple-
tion of this cosmological model). A partial quantisation of closed strings on M3 appeared
in [35]. Since twisted tori are used as internal manifolds, it is important for string phe-
nomenology to determine the corresponding low-energy eﬀective theory in four dimensions.
Four-dimensional gauged supergravities can be obtained by a truncation to a ﬁnite set of
modes, as e.g. in [36, 37]. Whether this set corresponds to the light modes in a controlled
low-energy approximation has not yet been settled. Contrary to reductions on pure Calabi-
Yau manifolds or even torus, where the light modes are massless and the truncation of the
KK tower is a good low-energy approximation, here the curvature induces additional en-
ergy scales that should be compared to the KK scale, and gives rise to massive light modes
that complicate the truncation. The concrete KK scalar spectrum obtained in the present
work should help clarify these issues.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we present twisted tori and build our
nilmanifold M3, deﬁning in particular explicit coordinates together with discrete identiﬁ-
cations that make the manifold compact; we also write down the most general left-invariant
metric on M3. In Section 3 we analyse the KK spectrum of a scalar ﬁeld for that metric,
ﬁrst in a simple case and then in the most general one. Section 4 contains a numerical pro-
cedure used to study spectra on CNS that we test against the analytical solutions obtained
in the previous section. Finally, in Section 5 we discuss how a Dark Matter candidate
may arise in an orbifolded version of the twisted torus. We conclude in Section 6. Further
technical details can be found in the appendices.

2 The three-dimensional nilmanifold

2.1 From algebras to compact manifolds

We consider here Lie algebras and Lie groups in one-to-one correspondence with the ex-
ponential map. Those are closely related to geometry, since any Lie group of dimension d
can be viewed as a d-dimensional manifold. To build a (compact) solvmanifold, or twisted
torus, one divides a solvable Lie group by a lattice, namely a discrete subgroup that makes

– 3 –

the manifold compact thanks to discrete identiﬁcations. Given a d-dimensional algebra
generated by the vectors {Za, a = 1, . . . , d} satisfying

[Zb, Zc] = f a

bcZa ,

(2.1)

with structure constants f a
an orthonormal frame {ea, a = 1, . . . , d} obeying the Maurer–Cartan equation

cb, the corresponding d-dimensional manifold admits

bc = −f a

dea = − 1
2

bceb ∧ ec .

f a

(2.2)

These one-forms are globally deﬁned on the manifold. One can see from (2.2) that f a
bc is
related to the spin connection. The Ricci tensor (in ﬂat indices) can then be expressed in
terms of the structure constants: for a unimodular Lie algebra, one gets

with the ﬂat, here Euclidian, metric δab; see e.g. [31]. For a nilpotent algebra (subcase of

vanishing and the corresponding Ricci scalar

(2.4)

is constant and strictly negative.

For d = 3, in addition to the trivial abelian algebra leading to the three-torus, there
are three diﬀerent solvable algebras. Only one of them is nilpotent: it is the Heisenberg
algebra, given by

[Z1, Z2] = −f Z3 ,

[Z1, Z3] = [Z2, Z3] = 0 ,

with f = −f 3

12 (cid:54)= 0, for which (2.2) takes the form
de1 = 0 ;

de3 = f e1 ∧ e2 ;

de2 = 0 .

(2.5)

(2.6)

The constant f thus has dimension of an inverse length. To build our 3-dimensional nilman-
ifold M3, and to discuss in detail associated physical models, a set of explicit coordinates
has to be selected. The following choice is consistent with (2.6)

e3 = r3(cid:0)dx3 + N x1dx2(cid:1) ; N =

r1r2
r3 f ,

(2.7)

e1 = r1dx1 ;

e2 = r2dx2 ;

for some constant (positive) “radii” r1, r2, r3, and angular coordinates xm. This is the
most general solution up to redeﬁning the coordinates.1

For a compact three-dimensional M3, we impose the following discrete identiﬁcations

(under a unit shift of the angles)
x2 ∼ x2 + n2 ;

x1 ∼ x1 + n1 ;
1Of course we could absorb the radii by rescaling the coordinates. However we have preferred to factor
out the normalisation of the xm’s so that we can impose integral identiﬁcations, see (2.8) below. Note also
that ﬁxing the value of f makes (2.5) a single representative of a class of isomorphic algebras.

x3 ∼ x3 + n3 − n1N x2 , n1, n2, n3 ∈ {0, 1} ,

(2.8)

– 4 –

which come from demanding that (2.8) should leave (2.7) invariant. Choosing diﬀerent
integer values for the nm is in general allowed, but corresponds to another lattice. We see
from (2.8) that M3 is a twisted S1 ﬁbration over T 2, i.e. a twisted torus, with ﬁber coor-
dinate x3 and base parameterised by x1, x2. The discrete identiﬁcations (2.8) correspond
to the lattice action, making M3 a quotient of a nilpotent group by a discrete subgroup:
a nilmanifold. Finally, for consistency we must require

N ∈ Z∗ .

(2.9)

The integrality of N is discussed in Appendix A. Once the unit lattice in (2.8) is deﬁned,
one can verify that translations along the three directions with arbitrary nm ∈ Z are also
identiﬁed as in (2.8). In addition, the lattice cell deﬁned by a non unitary identiﬁcation is
equivalent to a unit cell with

r(cid:48)m = nmrm ,

N(cid:48) = N

n1n2
n3 = f

r(cid:48)1r(cid:48)2
r(cid:48)3

.

From the results in Appendix A, it follows that N(cid:48) ∈ Z∗, thus implying that

N

n1n2

n3 ∈ Z∗ .

(2.10)

(2.11)

To summarise, the space M3 is characterised by three independent radii rm=1,2,3 and an
integer N , related as in (2.7) to the structure constant or geometric ﬂux f. The coordinates
xm chosen are angles ranging in [0, 1]. In terms of physical dimensions, xm are dimensionless
while the rm are a length, and f is the inverse of a length, i.e. an energy.
2.2 General left-invariant metric on M3
In vielbein basis the most general left-invariant metric for M3 reads

ds2 = δabEaEb ,

(2.12)

where Ea are one-forms related to the orthonormal frame ea through a constant GL(3, R)
transformation L

Ea =(cid:0)L−1(cid:1)a

beb .

(2.13)

This description is redundant since we should mod out by the group Aut of automorphisms
of the Heisenberg algebra, i.e. by any M ∈ Aut that leaves (2.2) invariant. The M ’s such
that ma

beb satisfy (2.2) are constrained by

condition that, for the Heisenberg algebra, is solved by a matrix of the form:

We want to mod out by such elements, i.e. we want to consider in (2.13) only those L’s
that are not related to each other by some M . So we want to identify any elements L1
and L2 for which ∃M ∈ Aut such that L−1
2 M . Such an identiﬁcation, rewritten as
L ∼ M−1L, deﬁnes the equivalence class [L] of Aut in GL(3, R) (M and M−1 take the
same form); the set of these classes is precisely the coset Aut\GL(3, R), as expected. To
determine this coset, we need to ﬁnd representatives of each equivalence class. Consider the
following generic matrix G ∈ GL(3, R) and pick the M with the corresponding components,
then

Requiring for this M that G = M−1G implies that G must be an element of

(2.17)

(2.16)

E turns out to be the set of representatives. Indeed, consider ﬁrst L1 ∈ E and M ∈ Aut, then
one can easily verify that M L1 ∈ E ⇔ M = 1. Consider now L1, L2 ∈ E and L1 (cid:54)= L2, then
∀M ∈ Aut, M (cid:54)= 1, M L2 /∈ E so M L2 (cid:54)= L1. In addition, for M = 1, M L2 = L2 (cid:54)= L1.
We conclude that ∀M ∈ Aut, M L2 (cid:54)= L1, so [L1] (cid:54)= [L2]. Finally, one can verify that
the matrices M L span GL(3, R) since the product gives generic matrices with non-zero
determinant, so E is the set of representatives of the coset Aut\GL(3, R).2 As a side
remark, for the torus one gets E = {13}.

We now want to act with this set of transformations in (2.13). The inverse matrices
in (2.17) being of the same form, we ﬁnally obtain from (2.12) and (2.13) the most general
form of the metric

ds2 =(cid:0)e1 + ae3(cid:1)2 +(cid:0)e2 + be3(cid:1)2 + c2(cid:0)e3(cid:1)2 ,

a, b ∈ R, c ∈ R∗ .

We deduce that

g = r1r2r3|c|. Hence the volume is given by

Given the explicit form of the metric (2.18), we will calculate the Laplacian of a scalar Φ

∇2Φ =

∂m (

√

ggmn∂nΦ) .

(3.1)

The determinant of the metric being constant, it drops out here.

2Note that the matrices L form a group isomorphic to R∗ (cid:110) R2. However this does not mean that

Aut\GL(3, R) has the structure of a group: indeed Aut is not a normal subgroup of GL(3, R).

– 6 –

3.1 Simplest case: a = b = 0

As a warm-up we start by considering the special case a = b = 0, and we set all other
parameters to unity: c = 1, unit radii r1 = r2 = r3 = 1 and f = 1. Then the metric (2.18)
becomes

which gives the Laplacian

ds2 =(cid:0)dx1)2 +(cid:0)dx2)2 +(cid:0)dx3 + x1dx2(cid:1)2 ,
(cid:1) u .
∇2u =(cid:0)∂2

1 + (∂2 − x1∂3)2 + ∂2

3

In this paper we limit ourselves to studying a scalar ﬁeld, thus the wave-functions are
simply eigenmodes of the above Laplacian.

We would like to expand u on the space of functions invariant under (2.8). For functions

that do not depend on the coordinate x3, the Laplacian can easily be diagonalised

(cid:0)∇2 + µ2

(cid:1)˜vp,q = 0 ,

(3.10)

where the Klein-Gordon masses µp,q are given by

p,q = 4π2(p2 + q2) ,

and we deﬁned

˜vp,q(x1, x2) = e2πpix1

e2πqix2

;

p, q ∈ Z ,

which are manifestly invariant under (2.8).

More generally a basis of invariant functions uk,l can be expressed in terms of Weil-

Brezin-Zak transforms [38]

uk,l(x1, x2, x3) = e2πki(x3+x1x2)e2πlix1 (cid:88)

m∈Z

e2πkmix1

f (x2 + m) ;

k, l ∈ Z .

(3.7)

It can be checked that these functions uk,l are indeed invariant under (2.8) for any f (x), so
they are well-deﬁned on our manifold. Plugging (3.7) into the Laplacian (3.3) we obtain

∇2uk,l = e2πki(x3+x1x2)e2πlix1 (cid:88)

e2πkmix1(cid:110)

where we consider k (cid:54)= 0 to maintain an x3 dependence. Setting zm = x2 + m + l/k and
g(zm) = f (x2 + m) this becomes

Let us now recall the deﬁnition of the normalised Hermite functions

which obeys the diﬀerential equation

Hence by setting g(zm) = Φ2πk

l = 0, . . . ,|k| − 1 , k ∈ Z∗ , n ∈ N.

(3.15)

There is a mass degeneracy since (3.14) is independent of l. However the wave-functions
(3.15) are parameterised by a ﬁnite number of inequivalent l’s, 0 ≤ l ≤ |k| − 1, i.e. the
level of degeneracy is |k|. We have restricted l to the range of values indicated above due
to the fact that l is only deﬁned modulo k:4 this is a consequence of the identity

˜uk,l+pk,n(x1, x2, x3) = ˜uk,l,n(x1, x2, x3) ,

∀p ∈ Z ,

(3.16)

which readily follows from the deﬁnition of ˜uk,l,n. Finally, we remark that the only zero
mode (with vanishing mass) is given by the wave-function ˜v0,0, thus it belongs to the modes
on the torus base.

In order to have a physical spectrum, we now reintroduce the dimensional parameters

mentioned in Section 2.1, namely rm, f, and we also want to include c. We obtain

As in Section 3.1 the range of l is ﬁnite, leading to a ﬁnite degeneracy in the masses. This
can be seen from the invariance of (3.36) under L → L + KP , where P = r3
r1 p with p ∈ Z:
taking (3.26) into account it then follows that (3.36) is invariant under l → l + kp. It is
also straightforward to recover the results of Section 3.1 by setting the parameters to the
appropriate values.

The masses obtained in (3.34) only depend on the radius of the ﬁber, r3 (or r3c).
This is a way to understand the modes just discussed as coming from the ﬁber. As in
the simple case, there should be other modes coming from the base, independent of the
ﬁber coordinate. The most general decomposition of such modes, invariant under the
identiﬁcations (3.24), can be given in terms of a Fourier basis, i.e. in orthonormal form

the complete set of eigenmodes of the Laplacian on M3, as veriﬁed in Appendix C.

4 Numerical study of the spectrum

Having an analytical solution for the KK spectrum on a non-trivial manifold is an interest-
ing opportunity to check the validity of numerical methods that could be used in situations
where a complete derivation is out of reach, or as a cross-check on the completeness of
the set of modes analytically obtained. In this section we will check the validity of our
implementation of a numerical method that determines the eigenvalues of the Laplacian.
We will use the results derived in Section 3.1 in the simplest case where a = b = 0, c = 1,
rm=1,2,3 = 1 and f = 1.

Principle of the analysis

Several methods have been proposed to ﬁnd the spectrum of Laplace operators numerically,
in particular on hyperbolic manifolds [23–25] where no analytic results are known. We
found the algorithm by Cornish and Turok [23] to be the most straightforward to adapt
to nilmanifolds since it does not require any data apart from the Laplacian operator (3.3)
and a deﬁnition of the fundamental domain of the compactiﬁed manifold (2.8). Let us ﬁrst
review the principle of the algorithm:

• deﬁne a lattice representing the geometry of a choice of fundamental domain;
• deﬁne an approximate Laplacian operator ∆ on this lattice, using appropriate bound-

ary conditions to evaluate derivatives on the edge of the lattice;

• deﬁne an initial condition φ(x, t = 0) = φ0(x) for the ﬁeld (for simplicity we always

take ∂tφ(x, t = 0) = 0);

• generate the time evolution of this ﬁeld according to the equation ∂2

t φ = ∆φ.

The rationale is that the wave equation has a set of solutions given by φ(x, t) = ψq(x)eiqt

where ψq is an eigenfunction of ∆ with eigenvalue −q2 so that if φ0(x) =(cid:80) αqψq(x), the
solution can be expressed as φ(x, t) =(cid:80) αqψq(x)eiqt. Provided the spectrum is discrete (the

case for a compact space), the ﬁeld has a Fourier transform in the time variable composed
of Dirac peaks whose positions are given by the spectrum of the Laplace operator. A second
step in the algorithm is therefore to post-process the solution φ(x, t) as follows:

• perform a point-wise Fourier transform to get ˆφ(x, ω) =(cid:82) dtφ(x, t)e−iωt;
• extract the power spectrum C(ω) =(cid:82)

• extract the peaks to obtain a numerical spectrum.

Details of the implementation
In the simple case studied, the fundamental domain is a cube of physical dimension 1×1×1
with boundary conditions straightforwardly derived from (2.8):

• x2 ∈ [0, 1[ and (x1, 0, x3) ∼ (x1, 1, x3),
• x3 ∈ [0, 1[ and (x1, x2, 0) ∼ (x1, x2, 1),
• x1 ∈ [0, 1[ and (0, x2, x3) ∼ (1, x2, x3 − x2).

A cubic lattice on this fundamental domain is therefore perfectly suited for our purpose:
it is stable under the boundary conditions for any value of the spacing δx. We performed
the time evolution using the leapfrog method, which relies on the O(δt2) approximation of
the time derivative in the wave equation:

φ(x, t + δt) (cid:39) 2φ(x, t) − φ(x, t − δt) + δt∆φ(x, t) ,

(4.1)
where the Laplace operator is computed using the O(δx2) centred ﬁnite diﬀerence deﬁnition
of the second order derivatives in (3.3). Whenever a derivative requires the value of the
ﬁeld outside the fundamental domain, the boundary conditions are used to provide a value
from within the fundamental domain. At this order of precision in time and lattice spacing,
the leapfrog method in ﬂat space is proved to be stable under the condition that δt < 1√
δx
3
and, while the proof does not carry on to our situation, it seems indeed that, at small
enough time spacings, stability is ensured to very long simulation times on nilmanifolds as
well. In practice, we used a lattice spacing δx = 0.01 and a time spacing δt = 0.005, which
allowed simulations to be run to t = 100.

The Fourier transforms were calculated using the Gnu Scientiﬁc Library [39] imple-
mentation of the discrete Fourier transform, which takes as input a sampled function
{f (k∆t)}0≤k≤n at a rate ∆t over a period T = n∆t and returns a discrete spectrum
{ ˆf (l∆ω)}0≤l≤n/2, with resolution ∆ω = 2π/T and range up to a maximum pulsation of
ω = 2π/∆t. The long evolution time we used in our simulations therefore resulted in a
good resolution in the spectra we computed, ensuring a suﬃcient separation between the
diﬀerent peaks.

Results

To obtain a spectrum, we used initial states φ0(x) generated using randomly centred gaus-
sians within the central region of the fundamental domain. The standard deviation of
these functions gave us a handle to probe diﬀerent length scales while ensuring that the
boundary conditions were veriﬁed by having φ0(x) (cid:39) 0 on all the edges of the fundamental
domain. As can be seen in Figure 1, we ﬁnd very good agreement with the low-energy
spectrum derived analytically in (3.5) and (3.14).

Another check of the validity of the implementation is to use the eigenfunctions of
the Laplacian as an initial state. As seen in their expression (3.15), the combination
˜uk,0,n + ˜u−k,0,n is real and contains a series with a fast convergence due to the exponential

in the deﬁnition of the Hermite functions (3.10). A truncation of this series gives therefore
a good approximation of its values and we could check that such an initial state does show
the expected harmonic oscillation as depicted in Figure 2 (a). At the level of discretisation
we used for our simulations, however, this pure frequency behaviour is not stable for long
evolution times and signiﬁcant leaking to neighbouring modes happens, leading to the
double peak feature seen in Figure 2 (b).

the lower mode ˜u1,0,0 + ˜u−1,0,0 due to the long evolution time needed to produce a well-resolved
spectrum.

In light of these results, we remark that the algorithm we used to obtain the low-
energy scalar KK spectrum on the simplest nilmanifold works precisely enough to be used
as a predictive tool in contexts where an analytical solution is diﬃcult or impossible to
obtain. In particular, it could be applied to ﬁnd the spectrum of gauge ﬁelds and fermions
in particle physics models with nilmanifold extra-dimensions without localised ﬁelds.

We ﬁrst study in this section two discrete isometries of our Heisenberg nilmanifold M3.
Considering the resulting orbifolds, we discuss their ﬁxed points. Using these results and
the above KK spectrum, we propose a simple model for Dark Matter.

5.1 Orbifolding and ﬁxed points

We look for discrete isometries of the nilmanifold, such that an orbifolding can be per-
formed. Explicitly we consider transformations of the form:

 →

 x1

x2
x3

 x(cid:48)1

x(cid:48)2
x(cid:48)3

 = J ·

 ,

 x1

x2
x3

(5.1)

where J ∈ GL(3, R) is a constant matrix (more generally, J corresponds to ∂x(cid:48)/∂x). The
isometry condition then takes the form (in matrix notation):

The metric can be written as

g(x) = J T · g(x(cid:48)) · J .

g(x) = (L · e(x))T · L · e(x) ,

(5.2)

(5.3)

where the matrices L, e were deﬁned in (2.17) and (3.19) respectively.

Transformation T

Rather than examining the most general case, we ﬁrst focus on discrete actions on the T 2
base of the ﬁbration, such that the ﬁber coordinate x3 remains invariant. It can then be
seen that there is only one nontrivial solution to (5.2), corresponding to the transformation

T : x1,2 → −x1,2 ;

x3 → x3 ,

(5.4)

and we must set a = b = 0; all other parameters of the metric can be arbitrary. The
resulting orbifolded base T 2/Z2 is a square, topologically a disc:
it consists of the inter-
2 ] tensored with the interval parameterised by x2 ∈ [0, 1
val parameterised by x1 ∈ [0, 1
2 ].
There are four ﬁxed (ﬁber) circles, stemming from the points on the base: (x1, x2) =
(0, 0), ( 1
2 ). The scalar spectrum can be reorganised in eigenstates of the
orbifold involution (5.4). For the torus modes, we obtain the usual spectrum of a T 2/Z2
orbifold: starting from (3.18), the linear combinations
(vl,n ± v−l,−n) ,

2 , 0), (0, 1

are even, odd respectively. For the modes propagating in the ﬁber, it is the linear combi-
nations

(uk,l,n ± (−1)nuk,|k|−l,n) ,

1√
2

(5.6)

that are even, odd respectively. This can be seen by taking into account the deﬁnition
in (3.18), and the fact that the Hermite polynomials Hn are even (odd) under parity
transformations for n even (odd), and we have used the identity uk,−l,n = uk,|k|−l,n.

– 15 –

Transformation P
We would now like to perform an orbifolding of M3 by taking the discrete quotient with
respect to the involution P deﬁned as

P : x1 ↔ x2 ;

x3 → −x3 − N x1x2 .

(5.7)
This is an isometry only for b = −a in the metric, and for equal radii along the torus
directions, i.e. r1 = r2.
It is interesting to note that P commutes with T deﬁned in
(5.4):
if we deﬁne an orbifold projection on P , then (if a = b = 0) T acts as an exact
global symmetry that may preserve some of the KK modes as stable. Here, by stable, we
mean that all decays into zero modes are forbidden. As a ﬁrst step, we need to deﬁne the
geometry of the orbifold quotient.

Firstly let us make the deﬁnition of P more precise. For that we will make use of
the open cover of M3 given in Appendix A (see Figure 6). P exchanges x1 with x2,
which is well-deﬁned if 0 ≤ x1, x2 < 1, since in that case x1 ∈ U+ both before and after
the transformation. Similarly P is well-deﬁned in the case x1 = x2 = 1.
If however
0 ≤ x1 < 1, x2 = 1, then x1 ∈ U+ before the transformation but x1 ∈ U− after the
+ to x1− = 1 and
transformation.
correspondingly the value of the x3 coordinate before and after the transformation should
be understood as that of x3± respectively. The case 0 ≤ x2 < 1, x1 = 1 is completely
analogous. More explicitly, P is deﬁned in these two cases as

In that case P should be understood as sending x1

+) = (s, 1,−t − N s)

+, x2, x3

,

(5.8)

where 0 ≤ s < 1, t ∈ R with the understanding that x3 ∼ x3 + 1.

x3 over a generic point (x1, x2) with S1

No potential inconsistency can arise from the deﬁnition of P when 0 ≤ x1, x2 < 1 since
the bundle is trivial over that region of the base, being a subset of B+ × S1
x3. In that case
P relates the ﬁber S1
x3 over a diﬀerent point (x2, x1)
and identiﬁes the respective points on the base, “folding” the base along the diagonal in
the x1, x2-plane. Over a point on the diagonal (x1, x2) = (s, s), s ∈ [0, 1[, P acts as an
x3 resulting in an interval Is = S1/Z2. More precisely for each s ∈ [0, 1[, Is
involution on S1
can be parameterised by x3 ∈ [− 1
2 ]. This can be seen from the fact that
for each (x1, x2) = (s, s), P identiﬁes the points x3 = − 1
2 N s2 ± ε (therefore it ﬁxes the
point x3 = − 1

2 N s2), and we have x3 ∼ x3 + 1.

2 N s2,− 1

2 N s2 + 1

On the other hand there is a potential source of inconsistency arising from deﬁnitions
(5.8), which can be seen as follows: for s ∈ [0, 1[ deﬁne Ss1, Ss0, S1s, S0s to be the ﬁber
over the points (x1, x2) = (s, 1), (s, 0), (1, s), (0, s) respectively, as illustrated in Figure
3. Ss1 = Ss0 since the respective base points are identiﬁed and the bundle is trivial for
0 ≤ x1 < 1. Moreover Ss1 is mapped to S1s under (5.8) and Ss0 is mapped to S0s under
(5.7). The consistency check is therefore that x3− ∈ S1s and x3
+ ∈ S0s should respect the
gluing condition (A.4) which in this case reads,

x3− = x3

+ − N s .

(5.9)

– 16 –

Figure 3. The ﬁbers over the points (s, 1), (s, 0), (1, s), (0, s) on the base are the circles Ss1,
Ss0, S1s, S0s, respectively. The pairs of points (s, 1), (1, s) and (s, 0), (0, s) are mirror symmetric
with respect to the diagonal joining (0,0) and (1,1). The ﬁbers over each pair are related by the
orbifolding involution P . Points joined by dashed lines on the base are identiﬁed.

+ be the ﬁber coordinate over (x1

Having veriﬁed the consistency of the orbifolding action P , let us now determine its
ﬁxed points. As we already noted, these can only occur over the diagonal in the x1, x2-plane.
Before orbifolding, let us ﬁrst make some further remarks. Let x3− be the ﬁber coordinate
+, x2) = (0, 1) ∼ (0, 0). In
over (x1−, x2) = (1, 1) and let x3
this case the gluing condition (A.4) implies: x3− = x3
+. It follows that, when restricted over
the diagonal in the base space, the S1
x3-ﬁbration is trivial. Note that the diagonal is in fact
a circle, Sdiag, since the endpoints s = 0, 1 are identiﬁed. In particular the total space of
the ﬁbration restricted over the diagonal in the base is a trivial ﬁbration of S1
x3 over Sdiag,
i.e. a torus (see Figure 4.a). This fact simpliﬁes the analysis of the ﬁxed-point locus when
orbifolding since we can then parameterise all points in the diagonal (x1, x2) = (s, s) ∈ Sdiag
with a global coordinate s ∈ [0, 1].

2 N s2,− 1

As discussed earlier, upon orbifolding the ﬁber becomes Is over the diagonal base point
parameterised by s. This ﬁber can be thought of as the circle x3 ∈ [0, 1] “folded” along
the antipodal points x3 = − 1
2 ; these are the endpoints of the interval Is
deﬁned earlier. Therefore we have two lines of ﬁxed points: (x1, x2, x3) = (s, s,− 1
2 N s2)
2 ), s ∈ [0, 1]. If N is even, the endpoints of these lines
and (x1, x2, x3) = (s, s,− 1
at s = 0, 1 are identiﬁed, so instead of two lines we have in fact two circles of ﬁxed points.
These two circles deﬁne the boundary of the Is ﬁbration over Sdiag which in this case is
trivial, i.e. topologically a cylinder (see Figure 4.b).

2 N s2 + 1

2 N s2 + 1

If however N is odd the endpoints diﬀer by 1

2 in the x3 coordinate. Hence starting at
one endpoint of Is over s ∈ Sdiag, after going once around Sdiag we end up at the other
endpoint of Is. In this case the Is ﬁbration over Sdiag is therefore a M¨obius strip. The
ﬁxed-point locus is the boundary of the strip, which has the topology of a (single) circle

– 17 –

Figure 4. (a) The S1
x3-ﬁbration restricted over the diagonal Sdiag in the base is topologically a
torus. (b) For N even the orbifold ﬁbration of Is over Sdiag is a cylinder. The ﬁxed-point locus
is the boundary of the bundle, which consists of two circles. (c) For N odd the orbifold ﬁbration
of Is over Sdiag is a M¨obius strip. The ﬁxed-point locus is the boundary of the strip, which is
topologically a circle.

(see Figure 4.c).

Combining T and P

Finally, let us perform an orbifolding of the Heisenberg nilmanifold by taking the discrete
quotient with respect to the action generated by both involutions T and P deﬁned in (5.4)
and (5.7), (5.8) respectively. Noting that P , T commute, we will denote the resulting

orbifold by (cid:102)M3 = M3/Z2 × Z2.
To determine the topology of (cid:102)M3 it is easier to ﬁrst mod out by the action of T . As was

described below (5.4), the orbifolding by T gives a three-manifold which can be thought
of as an S1 ﬁbration over a square base. More precisely the base is parameterised by
(x1, x2) and it is a square with vertices (x1, x2) = (0, 0), ( 1
2 ). The S1 ﬁber is
parameterised by x3. After modding out by T there are no remaining discrete identiﬁcations
among the base points, hence the x1,x2 are globally well-deﬁned coordinates and the S1
ﬁbration is topologically trivial, i.e. modding out by T gives a square (topologically a disc)
tensored with a circle.

2 , 0), (0, 1

2 ), ( 1

2 , 1

Next let us mod out by P . Its action on the (x1, x2)-base can be viewed as a folding
of the square to form the triangle with vertices (x1, x2) = (0, 0), ( 1
2 ), which we
denote by O, A, B respectively. Let us now turn to the result of the action of P on the
S1 ﬁber. Above each base point (x1, x2) in the interior of OAB we have the same circle
parameterised by x3 as before: the action of P simply relates the circle over (x1, x2) ∈ OAB
to a circle over (x2, x1) /∈ OAB. The same is true for the sides OA and AB, excluding
the points O and B: over each point (x1, x2) we have the same circle parameterised by x3
as before. However on the circle S1 over each point (x1, x2) = (s, s) ∈ OB, s ∈ [0, 1
2 ], the
action of P results in an interval Is = S1/Z2, as mentioned previously.

To summarise: the (cid:102)M3 orbifold can be described as a topologically trivial ﬁbration

2 , 0), ( 1

2 , 1

with base the triangle OAB. Over each point on the base we have a circle ﬁber, except
over the interval OB where the ﬁber degenerates to an interval with endpoints J1, J2. The
ﬁxed locus of the Z2 × Z2 orbifolding consists of the two intervals: OB × J1 and OB × J2.

5.2 A simple Dark Matter model

As a ﬁrst example, and as a proof of concept, we want to build a model where the Dark
Matter candidate is provided by a scalar ﬁeld, singlet under the Standard Model (SM)
gauge symmetries, which propagates in the bulk of the nilmanifold. The SM ﬁelds, on the
other hand, are ordinary four-dimensional (4D) ﬁelds which propagate on a 4D subspace,
i.e. a point in the nilmanifold. For this construction to be consistent, therefore, we would
need an orbifold that contains singular points where a 4D brane can be localised, supporting
the SM ﬁelds. The orbifold examples given above do not satisfy this requirement, as the
singular points, left ﬁxed under the orbifold symmetry, form circles or intervals in the extra
space and thus correspond to 5D subspaces. For the existence of a natural Dark Matter
candidate, we further require that the orbifold space possesses at least another symmetry,
the Dark Matter parity, under which the KK modes can be labelled. The lightest state
odd under the latter will thus be our Dark Matter candidate, as it cannot decay into zero
modes nor into SM ﬁelds.

In this work, we do not attempt a complete classiﬁcation of the possible orbifolds,
rather we look for a simple example, i.e. the orbifold deﬁned by the involution P deﬁned
in (5.7) and (5.8) as it commutes with T in (5.4) which can be identiﬁed with the Dark
Matter parity. Note that the space is characterised by a = b = 0 (thus corresponding to
the simple case in Section 3.1, more precisely to (3.18)), and by r1 = r2 = r. While this
orbifold has no ﬁxed points but circles, the origin (0, 0, 0) ∼ (1, 1, 1) plays a special role, as
it belongs to the ﬁxed points of the orbifold and it is also left ﬁxed by T . Thus, localising
the SM on the origin is consistent with the orbifold and it does not break the Dark Matter
parity. We will therefore discuss a scenario where the SM is localised there, and the singlet
bulk scalar ﬁeld communicated to the SM via a Higgs portal coupling (which is the only
one allowed by gauge invariance).

To recapitulate, the symmetries we use to deﬁne the orbifold and Dark Matter (DM)

are

orbifold: → x1 ↔ x2 , x3 → −x3 − N x1x2 ;
DM parity: → x1,2 ↔ −x1,2 , x3 → x3 .

The wave-functions (3.18) for a = b = 0 can now be reorganised in terms of their parities

both DM-even and DM-odd states, except for the zero mode on the torus, and the modes
with k = 1 on the ﬁber. Furthermore, the lightest KK mode is the DM-even ﬁber mode

else it is in the lightest torus mode. A plot of the spectrum for N = 1 as a function of ξ can
be seen in Figure 5: we clearly see that for small ξ, i.e. large r3, a dense spectrum of ﬁber
states forms above a mass gap determined by the radius of the torus base. For increasing
ξ (decreasing r3), these states are lifted and for ξ > 1 the phenomenology is dominated by
the torus modes alone.

6 Conclusions and outlook

Nilmanifolds are a class of negatively-curved manifolds which oﬀer the possibility to an-
alytically calculate the spectrum of propagating ﬁelds. This property can be very useful

for the construction of eﬀective models of new physics beyond the Standard Model. One
attractive feature is that the spectrum of masses is quite diﬀerent from that of the more
familiar cases of ﬂat or positively-curved spaces. Moreover these models are likely to be
embeddable in string theory compactiﬁcations.

In this work, we considered three extra spatial dimensions, compactiﬁed as the three-
dimensional Heisenberg nilmanifold. This space consists of a one-dimensional ﬁber over a
two-dimensional torus base. After constructing an explicit metric and coordinate system
on the manifold, we studied the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the three-dimensional
Laplacian, which directly determines the spectrum and wave-functions of a scalar ﬁeld
propagating in the bulk of the manifold. We found that the spectrum contains a complete
tower of modes on the torus, which do not depend on the coordinate and radius of the
ﬁber. Additionally, there are states whose masses only depend on the ﬁber radius and on
the energy scale f related to the curvature. These ﬁber modes can be made lighter than
the torus modes by tuning the various scales, as discussed in Section 5.2, and the energy
gaps can be enhanced thanks to additional parameters in the general case (3.34). The ﬁber
modes are novel: the ﬁrst term in their masses (3.17) is the standard KK one, showing a
mass gap given by the radius, but the second term involving also f is unusual and gives
more ﬁnely-spaced modes following a linear Regge trajectory. The ﬁber can thus provide
a unique signature at a collider, if a particle physics model is built in this background.

As a ﬁrst example, we built a model consisting of a singlet scalar ﬁeld propagating in
the bulk, while the SM ﬁelds are localised on a brane in four dimensions. The orbifolding
of the nilmanifold is necessary in order to deﬁne ﬁxed points where the SM brane might
be localised. In the case we present, only ﬁxed circles are possible, however the orbifold

– 21 –

0.00.51.01.52.00.00.51.01.52.0ξMKKRspace has a residual isometry that can play the role of Dark Matter parity. This example
shows that this class of models are indeed possible.

We discussed in the Introduction the problem of the low energy approximation in
supergravity compactiﬁcations. The scalar spectrum obtained here does not allow to de-
couple the KK tower while keeping a few light massive modes. Indeed, despite the presence
of the geometric ﬂux f in the masses in addition to the radii, there is no approximation
leaving a ﬁnite set of massive modes while getting rid of the tower: sending the radii to
zero makes all ﬁber modes disappear and leaves only the torus base massless modes. This
can also be seen when replacing f
in (3.17). If any, light massive modes (or equiv-
r3
alently masses for moduli) then do not come from the reduction of scalars, but from that
of diﬀerent ﬁelds.

by N
r1r2

The spectrum of ﬁelds carrying non-trivial spin is more complicated to obtain, but
the algorithm presented and tested in Section 4 could be used for this purpose. This is
the natural next step in order to allow the whole SM to propagate in the bulk of the
nilmanifold instead of being localised. Indeed, while this paper focuses on a setup with a
bulk scalar ﬁeld whose excitations contain a dark matter candidate, it would be interesting
to investigate the case in which all SM ﬁelds are bulk ﬁelds and the dark matter candidate
is an excitation of a neutral SM ﬁeld, as realized in other types of extra-dimensional models
[11, 12, 40]. Furthermore, a more complete study of the orbifolds is necessary to identify a
space that can accommodate both a Dark Matter candidate and chiral fermion zero modes.
Our work is a ﬁrst step in using negatively-curved spaces for particle phenomenology.

A On the integrality of N

The integrality of N given in (2.7) can be understood as follows. The nilmanifold is a
circle ﬁbration of an S1 parameterised by x3 ﬁbered over a T 2 base parameterised by
x1, x2. Let us consider the associated principal U (1) bundle with ﬁber parameterised by
{g := e2πix3, x3 ∈ [0, 1]}. From (2.7) we see that the vertical displacement on the ﬁber can
be rewritten as:

(A.1)
where D := d + A is the U (1)-covariant derivative with connection A := 2πiN x1dx2. The
base of the bundle may be covered by the open patches B+ = U+× S1
x2 and B− = U−× S1

xm denotes the circle parameterised by xm; the open intervals U± furnish a cover

Evaluating the above at Q (x1

x2, N must be an integer. Alternatively
we can arrive at the same conclusion by noting that the ﬁrst Chern class of the principal
U (1)-bundle is integral in cohomology and is given by c1 = N dx1 ∧ dx2.

To obtain the twist of the ﬁber coordinate, let x3± be the coordinate of the S1

x3 ﬁber
over B± respectively and let g± = e2πix3± denote the corresponding points on the ﬁber of
the associated principal U (1) bundle. On the overlap B− ∩ B+ = Q × S1
x2 these are related
via g− = t · g+, which leads to

(A.4)
Note that the above equation is invariant under x2 ∼ x2 + 1, since x3 itself is only deﬁned
modulo integral shifts and N is an integer.

x3− = x3

+ − N x2 .

Finally, let us give a further derivation of these results. We ﬁrst consider the lattice
identiﬁcations (2.8) for nm=1,2,3 being either zero or some ﬁxed value in Z∗, and N ∈ R∗:
those can be rewritten as

(x1, x2, x3) ≡ (x1, x2 + n2, x3) ≡ (x1, x2, x3 + n3) ≡ (x1 + n1, x2, x3 − n1N x2) ,

(A.5)
with nm ∈ Z∗. Using each of them, one can prove the following chains of identiﬁcations:

(x1, x2, x3) ≡ (x1, x2, x3 + n3) ≡ ··· ≡ (x1, x2, x3 + N(cid:48)n3) ,

for any N(cid:48) ∈ Z∗ and

(x1, x2, x3) ≡ (x1, x2 + n2, x3) ≡ (x1 + n1, x2 + n2, x3 − n1N n2 − n1N x2)
≡ (x1 + n1, x2, x3 − n1N n2 − n1N x2) ≡ (x1, x2, x3 − n1N n2) .

N(cid:48) =

n3 N ∈ Z∗ ⇔ N =

n1n2 N(cid:48) ∈ Q∗ .

(A.8)

This reproduces for our M3 the mathematical result by Malcev [41], stating that for
nilpotent groups, a lattice exists (allowing to build the nilmanifold) if and only if the
structure constants of the algebra are rational in some basis. After rescaling the algebra by
the radii, N is nothing but the non-zero structure constant, and we indeed conclude that
having identiﬁcations by a lattice is equivalent to N being rational. In addition, specialising
to the case nm = 1, one deduces N = N(cid:48) ∈ Z∗, in agreement with the above result.

over x1 imposes similarly l− l(cid:48) = −k(m− m(cid:48)). Since 0 ≤ l ≤ |k|− 1 and similarly for l(cid:48), one
deduces |m − m(cid:48)| < 1 i.e. m = m(cid:48), thus l = l(cid:48). We deduce zm,k,l = zm(cid:48),k(cid:48),l(cid:48) and similarly

C On the completeness of the set of modes

In this appendix we argue that the set of Laplacian eigenmodes found in the main text,
namely Uk,l,n in (3.35) and Vp,q in (3.37), is complete. To show this, we verify that the
most general normalisable solutions to the diﬀerential equation have been found, given the
boundary conditions. To that end, we ﬁrst give the most general form of the functions
satisfying the boundary conditions, namely the identiﬁcations (3.24), and then solve the
equation for those. For eigenfunctions independent of X 3, (3.24) simply indicates functions
periodic in X 1 and X 2. Such a function can be written in full generality as two Fourier
series, leading to the modes Vp,q. Then, solving the equation does not introduce new
constraints. So we turn to the case of a non-trivial dependence on X 3.

Boundary conditions

Consider a function U (X 1, X 2, X 3) that satisﬁes the boundary conditions (3.24) with n1 =
n2 = n3 = 1. First of all, it is periodic in X 3 of period r3. It can thus be written in full
generality as a Fourier transform

U (X 1, X 2, X 3) =

e2πiKX 3

ck(X 1, X 2) ,

(C.1)

(cid:88)

k∈Z

where we use the notation (3.26). As we are interested in a dependence on X 3, we focus
on the modes with K (cid:54)= 0. For convenience, we rewrite ck as

ck(X 1, X 2) = dk,l(X 1, X 2)e2πi(KfX 1X 2+LX 1) .

(C.2)

– 25 –

We now study the boundary condition X 1 → X 1 + r1, X 3 → X 3 − fr1X 2:
each X 3 mode, we arrive at the condition

identifying

(C.3)
In addition, U should as well be periodic under X 2 → X 2 + r2, last of the three boundary
conditions. This translates into

dk,l(X 1 + r1, X 2) = dk,l(X 1, X 2) .

dk,l(X 1, X 2 + r2) = e−2πiKfX 1r2

dk,l(X 1, X 2) .

(C.4)

The periodicity condition (C.3) could lead to a Fourier series with coeﬃcients depending
on X 2. The remaining condition (C.4) translated on these coeﬃcients is then not easy to
solve. We proceed diﬀerently and introduce the Zak transform Zf (w, t) of a function f (t),
deﬁned as

Zf (w, t) =

e2πimwf (t + m) ,

(C.5)

(cid:88)

m∈Z

given some conditions on f that we will come back to. This transform veriﬁes precisely
the two properties of periodicity (C.3) and translation (C.4), up to appropriate normalisa-
tions. In addition, this transformation is invertible. We thus consider that dk,l is the Zak
transform of a function fk,l(X 2). Following [38, 42], this should be the only solution to the
boundary conditions. We get

(C.6)

and one can verify that (C.3) and (C.4) are satisﬁed using (3.26) and (2.9). We conclude
that the modes Uk,l in (3.25) with k (cid:54)= 0 are the most general ones verifying the boundary
conditions (3.24).

Solving the equation

We turn to the diﬀerential equation and follow the procedure presented in Section 3.2. Go-
ing from F to G to H to T are smooth operations that can be done in full generality. Fur-
thermore we perform the redeﬁnitions T (wm) = |λ| 1

For a generic Λ ∈ R, this is precisely the Hermite diﬀerential equation. Using series, this
equation can be shown to admit two independent solutions, sometimes called conﬂuent
hypergeometric functions of the ﬁrst kind. These series solutions, one of which consists of
odd powers of y and the other of even powers, converge for all y so are deﬁned without
restrictions (a particular case of Fuch’s theorem). For Λ = 2n ≥ 0 and for these values

only, one of these two series (depending on n being an even or odd integer) gets truncated
to a Hermite polynomial; the other one remains an inﬁnite series. In Sections 3.1 and 3.2,
we took precisely this Λ and the Hermite polynomial to solve the equation. More generally
for Λ ∈ R, one would obtain the following mass

M 2 = (A + |λ|(1 + Λ))

Such a continuous spectrum is not consistent with the fact that the Laplacian spectrum of
normalisable functions on a compact manifold should be discrete. Here, the only distinction
among solutions allowing a discretisation would be the value Λ = 2n ≥ 0 and the Hermite
polynomials. One may then wonder about the inﬁnite series solutions. They turn out to
be very divergent at inﬁnity. For instance, when Λ (cid:54)= 2n, the even series behave at y ∼ ∞
as a constant times ey2. Coming back to T , the e− 1
2 y2
factor is not enough to compensate
this divergence. Coming back to F , one obtains at X ∼ ∞

|F (X)| ∼ e

|λ|
2 (X)2

(C.9)

As a consequence, the Zak transform on F cannot be deﬁned (its deﬁning series does not
converge). More precisely F /∈ L1(R, C), F /∈ L2(R, C), nor does F satisfy the “decay
condition”, which is problematic for the Zak transform as discussed in chapter 16 of [43].
This illustrates why the inﬁnite series solutions and their continuous spectrum are excluded.
On the contrary, for a (Hermite) polynomial H(y), the combination with e− 1
2 y2
in T is not
divergent at inﬁnity, and the convergence is good enough to deﬁne the Zak transform.

We conclude that the modes Uk,l,n in (3.35) are the only solutions to our problem. They
are normalisable wave-functions, as shown in Appendix B, and give the discrete spectrum
(3.34).
