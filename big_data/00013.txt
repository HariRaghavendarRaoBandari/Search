INTRODUCTION

Since the discovery of a particle consistent with being the SM Higgs boson in LHC at 2012 [1, 2],
our understanding of Standard Model has improved greatly. Yet limited by the underlying QCD
interaction from proton-anti-proton collision, one has great diﬃculty to measure the properties of
the Higgs precisely. Next generation electron-positron linear collider could hopefully make precision
measurements of the Higgs sector and the Top quark sector [3].

The leading candidates for next generation electron-positron linear collider are the International
Linear Collider (ILC) [4], and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) [5]. The ILC has developed two
detector models, namely the International Large Detector (ILD) [6] and the Silicon Detector (SiD)
[7]. The CLIC has developed two slightly modiﬁed detector models based on ILD and SiD [5]. One
key common feature of these next generation electron-positron linear colliders is the high granular
calorimeter, which provides a great spatial resolution at the cost of the energy resolution. Particle
ﬂow algorithms (PFA) beneﬁt from the spatial resolution from calorimeters, together with tracking
information, to provide excellent a jet energy resolution. PandoraPFA, the most complicated and
the best performing one, provides a jet energy resolution of less than 3.5%, which is required for
W/Z separation [8, 9].

Photon reconstruction is an important part of particle reconstruction. For many physics pro-
cesses involving particles decaying into photons, such as τ lepton and π0, a good photon recon-
struction, which provides a good single photon completeness and purity, as well as a good photon
separation resolution, is crucial for reconstructing these particles.

II. OVERVIEW OF EXISTING PHOTON RECONSTRUCTION IN PANDORAPFA

PandoraPFA provides a framework for particle reconstruction [10]. In the linear collider content,
it has a vast library of algorithms, developed through years by many people, each aiming to address
one topological issue in reconstruction [8, 9]. The essential part is track-cluster association and
reclustering to ﬁnd the best track-cluster pair. Algorithms that removes clusters without tracks in
the tracking detector, such as removing muon clusters or photon clusters, would provide a cleaner
environment for reconstruction of charged hadrons, hence improving the jet energy resolution.

Photon identiﬁcation in PandoraPFA has two main mechanisms. The basic photon identiﬁcation
performs photon identiﬁcation test on clusters that are not matched to tracks, after track-cluster
association and reclustering processes. The second photon identiﬁcation, a more aggressive stan-
dalone algorithm, is performed before track-cluster association and reclustering process, aiming
to remove the photon electromagnetic shower cores carefully from the rest of the complicated
environment.

The addition of the second mechanism has provided an improvement for jet energy resolution, as
compared to the case without it, due to correctly identifying photon electromagnetic shower cores
and leaving a cleaner environment for the particle ﬂow algorithms. However, its aggressiveness in
identifying electromagnetic shower cores leaves the outer parts of the shower core as fragments,
which may be reconstructed as separate particles. This undesired feature presents diﬃculties for
anyone to use the number of reconstructed photons as a good physical quantity. Also, there is room
for improvement for a better photon separation resolution, as the photon reconstruction algorithm
could only identify nearby photons at four cell sizes apart in the electromagnetic calorimeter (see
Fig. 5).

This paper presents a solution to the problem above, the fragmentation of photon reconstruc-
tion in PandoraPFA, as well as introducing new algorithms that improve the photon separation
resolution.

The testing simulated data in this paper are generated either by WHIZARD [11] or by the simple
HepEvt generator. Events are simulated with GEANT4 [12] in MOKKA [13]. Jet fragmentation
was performed with PYTHIA [14] and the particle reconstruction was done by PandoraPFA [10]
in MARLIN reconstruction framework [15], in ILD o1 v6 detector model. The iLCSoft v17-01-07

III. OVERVIEW OF CHANGES TO PHOTON RECONSTRUCTION

FIG. 2: An event display of a typical 10 GeV photon (Fig. 2a), reconstructed into a main photon cluster
(Fig. 2b) and a photon fragment cluster (Fig. 2c).

Fig. 2 illustrates a typical creation of photon fragments in the electromagnetic calorimeter
(ECal). When the core of the photon electromagnetic shower is identiﬁed as a photon (the main
photon), the outer part of the shower is reconstructed as a separate particle, and wrongly identiﬁed
as a photon or a neural hadron (the photon fragment). The photon fragment does not have the
typical shower like structure of a main photon, and typically it is has much lower energy than the
main photon. Thus these characteristics of fragments provide a way of merging photon fragments
to the main photon.

To merge photon fragments to the main photon, we carefully compare distributions of various
quantities for main photon-fragment pairs and main photon-other particles pairs, and choose cuts
that would merge fragments to main photons and not merge other particles to main photons.
The most useful distances related parameters are the simple distance between centroids of the
pair, and the mean intra-layer distance weighted over energy between the pair, where the main
photon-fragment pairs should have a small distance metric and main photon-non-photon particles
pairs would have larger ones. The other useful method is the energy deposition of the pair in a
transverse plane perpendicular to the direction of the ﬂight, where the main photon-fragment pairs
produce a single peak in the two dimensional shower, and the main photon-non-photon particles
pairs produce two peaks in the two dimensional shower.

Based on this, two algorithms have been carefully implemented to merge fragments in elec-
tromagnetic calorimeter to the main photons. One algorithm (RecoPhotonMergingAlgorithm) is
placed immediately after the standalone photon identiﬁcation. The other one (PhotonMergingAl-
gorithm) is placed at the end of the reconstruction chains in PandoraPFA. The two algorithms
provide an excellent reduction in the number of fragments created, as shown in Fig. 5.

Another type of photon fragment is caused when a highly energetic photon, typically more than
50GeV, goes through the ECal and deposits energy in the hadronic calorimeter (HCal), illustrated
in Fig. 3. Since the photon identiﬁcation in PandoraPFA implicitly assumes that all photons are
contained in the ECal, the energy deposited in the HCal either becomes neutral hadron fragments
or part of a hadronic shower if a hadronic shower of another particle is nearby.

Similar to the treatment of fragments in the ECal, we merge the fragments in the HCal by
calculating various quantities and place selection cuts. The important quantities are the distance
between centroid for main photon and fragments, the distance of closest approach of the directions

of the ﬂights for main photon and fragments, and the fraction of energy in a ﬁtted cone in HCal by
extending the ﬁtted cone from main photon in the ECal, where for main photon-fragment pairs,
the distance metrics are small and the fraction of the energy in a ﬁtted cone in HCal are large.

We implemented the algorithm in PandoraPFA (HighEnergyPhotonRecovery), after the stan-
dalone photon reconstruction algorithm, which successfully remove most of photon fragments in
the HCal for high energy photons, as shown in Fig. 5b.

FIG. 4: Two 500 GeV photons (yellow and blue), being just resolved in the transverse plane perpendicular
to the direction of the ﬂight, of their energy deposition in electromagnetic calorimeter. U and V axis are
two arbitrary axis perpendicular to each other in the plane. Z axis is the sum of the calorimeter hit energy
in each particular bin in 2D plane in GeV.

With these new fragment merging algorithms, we have removed most of the photon fragments.
We also improved the photon separation resolution by rewriting the existing standalone photon
reconstruction algorithm and the existing 2D peak ﬁnding algorithm.

The core part of the standalone photon reconstruction algorithm is to identify peaks in a 2D
plane, the energy deposition of a transverse 2D plane perpendicular to the direction of the ﬂight.
Each identiﬁed peak will form a cluster. The cluster will be identiﬁed as a photon if it passes the
photon likelihood test. The key to improve photon separation resolution is to improve the 2D peak
ﬁnding algorithm. We have implemented a new peak ﬁnding algorithm, which ﬁnds all possible
local maxima. Other cells in the 2D plane are associated to each peak by minimising the metric
d/p(E), where d is the distance in 2D plane from the cell to the peak, and E is the energy or

height of that particular peak. Fig. 4 shows two energetic photons just resolved with the new 2D
peak ﬁnding algorithm.

We also carefully identify photons close to charged hadrons, by discarding identiﬁed peaks in
2D plane that are associated with tracks. The likelihood test for photons is improved by taking
the normalisation factor into account.

As shown in Fig. 7, jet energy resolution at high energy has improved due to the improving

ability to identify photons close to charged hadrons.

We also implemented a new photon separation algorithm (PhotonSplittingAlgorithm) at the end
the reconstruction in PandoraPFA to separate photons that are wrongly merged into one photon
by algorithms in the construction chain. The photon separation algorithm uses the new 2D peak
ﬁnding algorithm and separate photon clusters according to peaks in the 2D plane. Hence if two
photons are merged and are identiﬁed as two peaks in the 2D plane, the new algorithm would
correctly separate the merged photon into two photons. As shown in Fig. 5a, the separation of two
photons improved from previously four cell size as minimum separation distance to two cell size.

We will review performance metrics of above algorithms. Fig. 5a shows the number of recon-
structed photons as a function of their true distance separation for a two photons per event sample.
The reduction of the number of reconstructed photons are mainly due the the fragment merging
algorithms for fragments in the ECal. Fig. 5b shows a similar reduction in the reconstructed par-
ticles as in Fig. 5a, and it shows that neutral hadron fragments in HCal have been merged back to
main photons.

Fig. 5 also shows the separation resolution is improved with new 2D peak ﬁnding algorithms
and new photon reconstruction. Two photons start to be separated at a much shorter distance,
typically starting to resolve when they are two cell size (10 mm) apart comparing to previously
four cell size (20 mm) apart.

FIG. 6: Figure shows the normalised energy in the fragment as as a function of their true distance separation
for a two photons per event sample. The normalised fragment energy is deﬁned as the energy in fragments
divided by the total reconstructed energy in the event. The blue line is reconstructed with PandoraSettings-
Default.xml with iLCSoft v01-17-07. The orange line is reconstructed with PandoraSettingsDefault.xml plus
two fragment merging algorithm (RecoPhotonFragmentMergingAlgorithm and PhotonFragmentMergingAl-
gorithm). The green line is is reconstructed with PandoraSettingsDefault.xml plus all algorithms described
above.

Fig. 6 shows the energy in the fragment as as a function of their true distance separation for
a two photons per event sample. The fraction of energy in the photon fragments has reduced
considerably, which is consistent with the reduction of number of reconstructed photons. The
green line which is shows the best performance, comparing with the orange line which did not
contains the PhotonSplittingAlgorithm and the new 2D Peak Finding algorithm, indicates the
fragments in the HCal are merged to the main photon correctly.

Fig. 7 shows the comparison of jet energy resolution for di-jet energy of 91, 200, 360 and 500 GeV,
before and after the improvement. Although there is a small degradation at low energy, the jet
energy resolution improves at high energy.

The jet energy resolution is deﬁned as the root mean squared divided by the mean for the smallest width of

V. CONCLUSION

This paper presents the algorithms for improving photon reconstruction in PandoraPFA, reduc-
ing the fragmentation and to improve the photon separation resolution. As a result, reconstructed
photons have a greater completeness and purity, and the jet energy resolution has improved for
high energy jets.

This will feed back to physics studies that involves photons as part of the ﬁnal decay states. For
example, τ lepton and π0 decay and single photon study would beneﬁt from the improved photon
reconstruction.

Future work could consist of improving the photon separation resolution further by using tem-

plate ﬁt for two photons that are inseparable by 2D peak ﬁnding algorithms.
