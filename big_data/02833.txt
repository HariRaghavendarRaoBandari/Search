Since the ﬁrst suggestion of the Jarzynski equality many derivations of this equality have been
presented in both, the classical and the quantum context. While the approaches and settings greatly
diﬀer from one to another, they all appear to rely on the initial state being a thermal Gibbs state.
Here, we present an investigation of work distributions in driven isolated quantum systems, starting
oﬀ from pure states that are close to energy eigenstates of the initial Hamiltonian. We ﬁnd that,
for the nonintegrable system in quest, the Jarzynski equality is fulﬁlled to good accuracy.

Introduction. The last decades have witnessed a re-
newed interest in the old question if and how closed
ﬁnite quantum systems approach thermal equilibrium.
Equilibration and thermalization have been theoretically
discussed for both, fairly abstract [1–6] and more spe-
ciﬁc systems of condensed-matter type [7–10]. Key con-
cepts in this discussion are typicality (or concentration
of measure) and the eigenstate thermalization hypothe-
sis (ETH). With the advent of experiments on ultracold
atoms, some of the theoretical results have even become
testable. As of today, the mere existence of some sort
of equilibrium in closed quantum system has been the
most widely addressed question. However, lately the dy-
namical approach to equilibrium has been intensely in-
vestigated [11, 12]. Here, crucial questions are relaxation
times but also the degree of agreement of quantum dy-
namics with standard statistical relaxation concepts like
master or Fokker-Planck equations, stochastic processes,
etc. [13–15] The crucial feature that discriminates these
types of analysis from standard open-systems concepts,
like quantum master equations, is the fact that the sta-
tistical dynamics emerge from the systems themselves,
i.e., are not induced by any bath.

Also ﬂuctuation theorems have been and continue to
be a central topic in the ﬁeld of statistical mechanics [16].
The Jarzynski relation (JR), making general statements
on work that has to be invested to drive processes also
and especially far from equilibrium, is a prime example
of such a ﬂuctuation theorem. Many derivations of the
JR from various starting grounds have been presented.
These include classical Hamiltonian dynamics, stochastic
dynamics such as Langevin or master equations, as well
as quantum mechanical starting points [16–20]. However,
all these derivations assume that the system that is acted
on with some kind of “force” is strictly in a Gibbsian
equilibrium state before the process starts. This starting
point diﬀers from the progresses in the ﬁeld of thermal-

ization: There, the general features of thermodynamical
relaxation are found to emerge entirely from the system
itself without the necessity of evoking external baths or
specifying initial states in detail. Clearly, the preparation
of a strictly Gibbsian initial state requires the coupling
to a bath prior to starting the process.

In this Letter, we study the question whether or not the
JR is valid with a system starting in a state other than a
Gibbs state. Since counterexamples can be constructed,
any aﬃrmative answer cannot hold for any quantum sys-
tem and for any process protocol.
In fact, previous
works [21–24] have shown that, when the initial state
is microcanonical, the JR does not follow, but a related
entropy-from-work relation emerges instead. The ques-
tion remains, however, if and under what conditions the
JR holds approximately for non-canonical initial states.
Thus, the emphasis in the search for the origins of the
JR’s validity is shifted from specifying the initial state to
specifying the nature of the system.

JR and ETH. To further clarify this, consider the stan-
dard setup of the quantum JR for closed systems. It is
based on a two-measurement scheme: If the system is
at energy Eini before the process, then there is a condi-

tional probability T = T (Eﬁn|Eini, λ(t)) (with λ(t) being
the protocol) to ﬁnd the system at Eﬁn after the process
[25]. Let W = Eﬁn − Eini be the work associated with
this transition. The average of the exponentiated work
he−βWi can now be written as

T e−β(Efin−Eini)Pini(Eini) .

(1)

he−βWi = XEfin,Eini

Obviously, he−βWi depends on Pini(Eini).
It is well-
known that the JR he−βWi = e−β∆F always holds for
initial Gibbs states Pini(Eini) ∝ e−βEini, regardless of the
system and the protocol. Much less is known on other
initial states, e.g., initial energy eigenstates Pini(Eini) ≈
δEini,En with En being the energy of an eigenstate. These
states are in center of our Letter.

It is very important to note that this question can be
recast as a question on the validity of the ETH in a spe-
ciﬁc sense: As shown in [21], the average exponentiated
work can be written as the expectation value

he−βWi = he−βHH

fineβHiniidiag ,

(2)

where Hﬁn/ini are the ﬁnal/initial Hamiltonian (with
the index H indicating the Heisenberg picture) and
h···idiag denotes the average over the diagonal part
of the initial density matrix w.r.t. the eigenbasis of
Hini [21]. Let h···ican/mic denote averages over canon-
ical/microcanonical states, which are both diagonal in
the above sense. While the standard JR he−βWi =
he−βHH
fine−βHiniican = e−β∆F always holds, our questions
can be reformulated as

he−βHH

fineβHiniimic

?= he−βHH

fineβHiniican .

(3)

The validity of this equation is claimed by the ETH (even
though the operator in the average is non-Hermitian).
Since each protocol yields a diﬀerent H H
ﬁn, the JR’s va-
lidity for microcanonical states is equivalent to the ETH’s
validity for a set of diﬀerent operators. So far, how-
ever, no general principle guarantees the applicability
of the ETH, except for large quantum systems with
a direct classical counterpart [26] or systems involving
random matrices [27]. While the ETH is expected to
hold for non-integrable systems and few-body observ-
ables, e−βHH
fineβHini is not such an operator. Thus, in-
vestigating the JR’s validity for microcanonical states is
an highly non-trivial endeavor.

In this Letter, we use numerical methods to prepare
an energetically ﬁrmly concentrated initial state and to
propagate it according to the Schr¨odinger equation for
a complex spin system with a strongly time-dependent
Hamiltonian. Due to the initial state being sharp in
energy, the eventual energy-probability distribution is
interpreted as a work-probability distribution and thus
checked for agreement with the JR, including a careful
ﬁnite-size scaling. As there is no thermal initial state, we

2

use for the inverse temperature β in the JR the standard
deﬁnition dS/dE = β and resort to the microcanonical
entropy S = ln n(E), where n(E) is the density of energy
eigenstates (DOS). Thus, β depends on the spectrum.
Since β also depends on E, we evaluate β at the initial
energy Eini.

Spin model and time-dependent magnetic ﬁeld. The
choice of our speciﬁc spin model including all its parame-
ters roots in its being a prime example for the emergence
of thermodynamical behavior in closed, small quantum
systems. The quantum dynamics of certain observables
have been found to be in remarkable accord with an irre-
versible Fokker-Plank equation for the undriven system
and with a Markovian stochastic process in a more de-
tailed sense [13].

As shown in Fig. 1, we study an anisotropic spin-1/2
Heisenberg ladder with the rung coupling being signif-
icantly weaker than the leg coupling. Speciﬁcally, the
Hamiltonian H = JkHk + J⊥H⊥ consists of a leg part
Hk and a rung part H⊥,

are spin-1/2 operators at site (i, k). Jk,⊥ > 0
are antiferromagnetic exchange coupling constants with
J⊥ = 0.2 Jk, ∆ = 0.6 is the exchange anisotropy in the z
direction, and L is the number of sites in each leg. We
set Jk = 1 throughout this work.

A magnetic ﬁeld (h) is turned on once the time evolu-
tion starts. The ﬁeld is uniform along each individual leg,
pointing in the positive z direction on one leg and in the
negative z direction on the other. This ﬁeld is linearly
ramped up in time from zero to hmax for a certain time
τ , and then linearly ramped down for the same time with
the same slope. Thus, the ﬁeld starts of at zero and ends
at zero, i.e., initial and ﬁnal Hamiltonian are identical.
More precisely, we model the ﬁeld by

h(t) = −h f (t) (Sz
i=1 Sz

1 − Sz
2 ) ,

k = PL

where Sz
i,k, f (t) = t/τ for 0 < t ≤ τ , and
f (t) = 2 − t/τ for τ < t ≤ 2τ . The full Hamiltonian is
Htot(t) = H + h(t). We choose the ﬁeld strength h = 0.5
for all simulations and vary the sweep time τ .

(5)

To specify a quantity that plays the role of tempera-
ture, we must have information on the DOS of H. Since
the numerical diagonalization of H is unfeasible for the
system sizes we are interested in, we resort to the numer-
ical method described in [29]. This method is incapable
of resolving individual energy eigenvalues but captures
rather accurately the coarser features of the DOS [28].
The result for our Hamiltonian is displayed in Fig. 2.

FIG. 2. DOS n(E) for the Heisenberg S = 1/2 ladder in
Eq. (4) with J⊥ = 0.2 Jk, ∆ = 0.6, and L = 11. Due to
the method used to obtain the numerical data, the energy
resolution 0.007(6) is high but ﬁnite [28]. The initial state
prepared is also indicated. Inset: The same as the main panel
but in a semi-log plot and with the inverse temperature β =
1.2(3) indicated.

We choose the initial energy Eini to locate the pro-
cess at a non-peculiar temperature regime, i.e., neither
extremely high nor very low (nor negative) tempera-
tures but an intermediate regime on the natural scale
of the model: β ∼ 1/Jk. To this end, we prepare
an initial state that is energetically ﬁrmly concentrated
at Eini = −4.2(8) for L = 11. Using the deﬁnition
β = d/dE ln n(E) yields β = 1.2(3). It is worth pointing
out that, in this energy regime, β does not vary much on
an interval of ca. 2Jk, which is about the overall scale of
the work required for our process.

Preparation and characterization of the initial state.

We prepare a state of the form

|Ψ(a, Eini)i =

e−a(H−Eini)2/4 |Φi
hΦ| e−a(H−Eini)2/2 |Φi

,

(6)

where |Φi is a random state drawn according to the
Haar measure on the total Hilbert space. Obviously,
|Ψ(a, Eini)i is always centered at the energy Eini with a
variance ∝ 1/a. Clearly, since |Φi is random, any quan-
tity calculated from |Ψ(a, Eini)i is random. However, as
shown (and applied [10, 30, 31]) in the context of typi-
cality, the average ¯Q of any quantity Q calculated from
|Ψ(a, Eini)i equals the Q calculated from the mixed state
ρ ∝ e−a(H−Eini)2/2. Moreover, the “error” ǫ2 = ¯Q2 − ¯Q2
scales as ǫ ∝ Tr{e−a(H−Eini)2/2)}−1/2 and is very small if
the Hilbert space is large (but a is not too large). Invest-
ing with reasonable computational eﬀort, we are able to
reach a = 1000. In this regime, ǫ is negligibly small [28].
Using the same method as for calculating the DOS,
we visualize the probability distribution of a state
|Ψ(a, Eini)i in Fig. 2. Clearly, this distribution is ﬁrmly
concentrated at Eini = −4.2(8).
Process, ﬁnal energy distribution, and JR. Now, we
perform the simulation of the actual process. To this
end, we propagate |Ψ(a, Eini)i in time according to the

FIG. 3. Probability distribution Pﬁn(E) of the ﬁnal state for
(a) weak, (b) intermediate, and (c) fast driving. (Remaining
parameters are identical to Fig. 2.) Due to the initial state
being almost an energy eigenstate, this distribution almost
coincides with the probability distribution of work.

Schr¨odinger equation using the time-dependent Hamil-
tonian Htot(t) = H + h(t) [28]. We do so for diﬀer-
ent sweep rates γ = 1/(2τ ), ranging from slow driving
γ0 = 2.6· 10−4 to fast driving at γ = 150γ0. This yields a
set of ﬁnal energy-probability distributions Pﬁn(E, γ), see
Fig. 3. Clearly, these distributions shift towards higher
energies and broaden with increasing γ. Furthermore,
they develop distinctly non-Gaussian features.

Let us compare this result against the JR which here,

since initial and ﬁnal Hamiltonian are the same, reads

he−βWi =Z PW (W ) e−βW dW = 1 .

(7)

If the initial state was a true energy eigenstate at en-
ergy E = Eini, then it would be justiﬁed to infer the
actual probability distribution of work PW from Pﬁn as
PW (W ) = Pﬁn(W + Eini).
In this case the latter ex-
pression could be used to check Eq. (7) directly. Given
the “narrowness” of Pini, it seems plausible that the ac-
tual work-probability distribution PW (W ) must be close
to Pﬁn(W + Eini). However, since Pini is not precisely
a δ-distribution, one cannot, strictly speaking, conclude
from Pﬁn onto PW . To nonetheless do so, we employ a
further assumption, namely, that the true PW computed
from an actual initial δ-function would not change much
under variation of the position of the initial δ-peak on
the order of the width of Pini, i.e., ≈ 0.25Jk. Under this
assumption, the l.h.s. of Eq. (7) may be cast into the

Thus, the l.h.s. of Eq. (8) yields he−βWi based on
Pﬁn, Pini for diﬀerent sweep rates γ. The closeness of
the outcome to 1 indicates how well the JR is fulﬁlled.
As shown in Fig. 4, for very slow processes the l.h.s. of
Eq. (8) is practically 1, while there is a diﬀerence of ca.
0.1 for faster processes. Comparing this diﬀerence to the
deviation of e−βhW i from 1, points to the approximate
validity rather than a strong violation of the JR.

To judge further on this, we use the following scheme:
For every actual Pﬁn(Eﬁn) there is a ﬁctitious probability
distribution P(Eﬁn) := Pﬁn(Eﬁn + δE), which is identical
in shape but shifted in energy by δE and fulﬁlls the JR
exactly, i.e., Eq. (8) with Pﬁn → P is identical to 1. We
use this equation to identify δE and get δE = 0.06(4)
for L = 11 and for γ = 40γ0 where the deviation of the
l.h.s. of Eq. (8) from 1 is largest. In Fig. 4 (b) we display
P(Eﬁn) together with Pﬁn(Eﬁn). Clearly, the diﬀerence
is hardly visible as δE is much smaller than the standard
deviation ∆E = 0.7(4) of either distribution. Thus, while
the JR is clearly violated, the smallness of δE indicates
that this violation is remarkably small.

4

It should be stressed that the JR exponentially am-
pliﬁes errors in the negative tail of the distribution [32],
i.e., a tiny lack of statistics in this tail can in principle
result in a large deviation from the JR (the observed non-
negativity of δE probably reﬂects this occurrence). This
implies that one needs roughly an exponential number of
samples to get a good estimate of the average exponen-
tiated work [33] even for initial canonical states. In this
sense the observed deviation from the JR of at most 10%,
obtained from a single wave function, is indeed small and
a central result of our Letter.

For all other sweep rates, δE turns out to be even
smaller, thus rendering the actual work-probability dis-
tribution even closer to the ﬁctitious one. Note that the
ﬁctitious probability distribution P(Eﬁn) introduced is
certainly not the only choice possible. However, it allows
for a very natural interpretation.

Finite-size scaling. Finally, we perform a ﬁnite-size
scaling for L = 9, . . . , 15 and Eini = −0.42(L − 1), yield-
ing β ≈ 1.2 within the attainable precision. Focusing on
γ = 40γ0 with the largest violation of the JR, we de-
pict the scaling ∆E(L) and δE(L) in Fig. 4 (c). While
∆E(L) follows a “trivial” upscaling ∆E(L) ∝ √L [28],

giving a precise statement on δE(L) remains challeng-
ing. Given the error bars shown, resulting from errors
when determining β by ﬁtting [28], a very reasonable
√L and indicated in Fig. 4 (c). Then,
guess is δE(L) ∝
δE(L)/∆E(L) = const. and we can expect that the JR
remains valid to very good approximation for L → ∞.
This is another central result of our work.
Conclusions. In summary, we have studied the validity
of the JR for non-canonical initial states that are pure
states close to energy eigenstates. To this end, we have
performed large-scale numerics to ﬁrst prepare typical
states of such kind and then to propagate these states
under a time-dependent protocol in a complex quantum
system of condensed-matter type. While we have found
violations of the JR in our non-equilibrium scenario, we
have demonstrated that these violations are remarkably
small and point to the approximative validity of the JR
in a moderately sized system already. Furthermore, our
systematic ﬁnite-size analysis has not shown indications
that this result changes in the thermodynamic limit of
very large systems.

While this result cannot be simply explained by the
equivalence of ensembles, it indicates the validity of the
ETH for a non-trivial operator being the “operator of
exponentiated work”. This validity is surprising due to
the structure of this operator but also since the ETH is
commonly associated with equilibrium properties, while
the JR addresses non-equilibrium processes. Promising
directions of future research include the generality of our
ﬁndings for a wider class of systems and protocols, the
necessity of the two-measurement scheme, as well as the
dependence of the work distribution as such on the type
of initial condition realized.

Time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation

The full Hamiltonian of the spin-1/2 ladder system
reads H(t) = H + h(t), where H and h(t) are deﬁned
by Eqs. (4) and (5) in the main text. Here, to shorten
notation, we write H(t) instead of Htot(t). The time evo-
lution of the system is governed by the time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) (in units of  = 1)

Initial state

The initial state is obtained by a Gaussian projection
of a random state drawn at random according to the Haar
measure on the total Hilbert space of the system,

|Ψ(a, E)i =

e−a(H−E)2/4 |Φi
hΦ| e−a(H−E)2/2 |Φi

,

(14)

where 1/a characterizes the variance of the Gaussian
projection and H is the Hamiltonian at t = 0. This
calculation is performed by employing the Chebyshev-
polynomial representation of a Gaussian function, prop-
erly generalized to matrix-valued functions [37, 38], and
yields numerical results which are accurate to about 14
digits.

In general, a function f (x) whose values are in the

range [−1, 1] can be expressed as

f (x) =

(15)

where |Ψ(t)i is the wave function of the system. The
solution of the TDSE can be written as

where Tk(x) = cos(k arccos x) are Chebyshev polynomi-
als and the coeﬃcients ck are given by

|Ψ(t + δt)i = U (t + δt, t)|Ψ(t)i

= exp+ −iZ t+δt

H(u) du! |Ψ(t)i, (10)

where δt is the time step. For small δt, the Hamiltonian
is considered to be ﬁxed in the time interval [t, t + δt] and
then the time-evolution operator may be approximated
by

U (δt) = U (t + δt, t) = exp(−iH(t + δt/2)δt) .
We solve the TDSE using a second-order product-
formula algorithm [35, 36]. The basic idea of the algo-
rithm is to use a second-oder approximation of the time-
evolution operator U (δt), given by

(11)

eU2(δt) = e−iδtHk/2 ··· e−iδtH1/2e−iδtH1/2 ··· e−iδtHk/2 ,

(12)
where H = H1 +···+Hk. The approximation is bounded
by

(13)

where c2 is a positive constant.

||U (δt) −eU2(δt)|| ≪ c2 δt3 ,

In practice, we use an XYZ decomposition for the
Hamiltonian according to the x, y, and z components
of the spin operators, i.e., H = Hx + Hy + Hz. The
computational basis states are eigenstates of the Sz op-
erators. Thus, in this representation e−iδtHz is diagonal
by construction, and it only changes the input state by
altering the phase of each of the basis vectors. By an
eﬃcient basis rotation into the eigenstates of the Sx or
Sy operators, the operators e−iδtHx and e−iδtHy act as
e−iδtHz .

For the operators f (H) = e−a(H−E)2/4, we normalize

Tk+1(eH) − 2eHTk(eH) + Tk−1(eH) = 0
with T0(eH) = 1 and T1(eH) = eH.

In practice, the coeﬃcients ck become exactly zero for
a certain k ≥ K. Hence, we have an exact representa-
tion of the Gaussian projection up to a sum of K terms in
Eq. (18). Note that the Chebyshev algorithm can only be
eﬃciently applied to solve the TDSE if the total Hamil-
tonian is time-independent [38].

where H is the Hamiltonian of the system at t = 0 and

respect to a random vector, e.g., by exploiting quantum
typicality [39, 40]. Thus, we have

Tr{e−itH}

D

≈ hΦ(0)|e−itH|Φ(0)i = hΦ(0)|Φ(t)i ,

(21)

where D is the dimension of the Hilbert space and |Φ(0)i
is a pure state drawn at random according to the uni-
tary invariant measure (Haar measure) and the error
scales with 1/√D. |Φ(t)i = e−itH|Φ(0)i can be eﬃciently

computed by the second-oder product-formula algorithm.
Therefore, the DOS can be conveniently calculated by
FFT,

n(E) ≈ CZ +Θ

−Θ

eitEhΦ(0)|Φ(t)idt ,

(22)

where C is a normalization constant and Θ is the time up
to which one has to integrate the TDSE in order to reach
the desired energy resolution π/Θ. The Nyquist sampling
theorem gives an upper bound to the time-step that can
be used. For the systems considered in the present pa-
per, this bound is suﬃciently small to guarantee that the
errors on the eigenvalues are small, see Ref. [39] for a
derivation of bounds, etc.

Similarly, we can obtain the local DOS (LDOS) of the
system for a particular pure state |Ψi, such as the initial
state and ﬁnal state of the system, by the formula

|hEn|Ψi|2 δ(E − En)

n δ(E − En) =Xn

(23)

(24)

where |Eni are energy eigenstates and dn = hEn|Ψi.
Note that the concept of typicality is not involved in the
calculation of P (E).

FIG. 5. Simulation results for the density of states n(E) for
a quantum ladder system with 18 spins (top) and 22 spins
(bottom). Two diﬀerent random states are used to compute
n(E) according to the algorithm described in the text. The
system Hamiltonian is deﬁned by Eq. (4) in the main text.

2. Copy this state to |Φ(t)i.
3. Calculate hΦ(0)|Φ(t)i and store the result.
4. Solve the TDSE for a small time step δt, replacing

|Φ(t)i by |Φ(t + δt)i.

5. Repeat K times step 3 and 4.

6. Perform a Fourier transform on the tabulated re-

sult.

In the simulation, we use δt = 0.02 for the second-order
product-formula algorithm and repeat K = 4096 × 5
steps. The total simulation time is Θ = 409.6. Hence,
the energy resolution is about π/Θ ≈ 0.0077. In princi-
ple, n(E) may be averaged over diﬀerent random states.
It turns out that this is only necessary for small system
sizes as the error scales with the square root of the di-
mension of the Hilbert space. Figure 5 shows the simula-
tion results for n(E) obtained from two diﬀerent random
states for systems with 18 and 22 spins. It can be clearly
seen that the curves n(E) obtained for two diﬀerent ran-

dom states coincide apart from some small ﬂuctuations.
These ﬂuctuations disappear for larger system sizes.

The strategy for numerically testing the Jarzynski re-

lation is:

1. Generate the initial state |Ψ(a, Eini, t = 0)i by the

Chebyshev polynomial algorithm.

2. Calculate the LDOS Pini(E) for the initial state

|Ψ(a, Eini, t = 0)i.

4. Calculate the LDOS Pﬁn(E) for the ﬁnal state

|Ψ(a, Eini, t = 2τ )i.

5. Repeat from step 3 for diﬀerent process rates γ =

1/2τ .

In the simulation, the parameters for the initial states
are a = 1000 and Eini = 0.42(L − 1), L = N/2, where N
ranges from 18 to 30. We use δt = 0.02 for the second-
order product-formula algorithm to solve the TDSE. Af-
ter the whole process, we collect the data sets of n(E),
hEiini, Pini(E), hEiﬁn, and Pﬁn(E) for further analysis.
Our goal is to test the validity of the Jarzynski relation
beyond the Gibbsian initial state in isolated systems, i.e.,

he−βWi =Z PW(W ) e−βW dW = e−β∆F ,

(25)

where the work W is deﬁned as W = Eﬁn − Eini accord-
ing to the two-measurement scheme, PW(W ) is the work
probability, and ∆F is the diﬀerence between the free en-
ergies of the two equilibrium states of the initial and ﬁnal
Hamiltonian. Obviously, we need to calculate both sides
of Eq. (25). The right-hand side equals 1 as the protocol
we uses (see Eq. (5) in the main text) ends with the same
Hamiltonian as the initial one and hence ∆F = 0. There-
fore, we only need to calculate the left-hand side, which
requires the information about the inverse temperature
β and the work probability PW(W ).

Estimation of the inverse temperature β

The initial state is narrowly centered at the initial en-
ergy Eini (as the standard deviation of Pini(E) is about
0.03 for a = 1000). A microcanonical temperature can
be calculated according to the standard formula

β =

dS
dE

,

(26)

where S = ln n(E) is the microcanonical entropy.

We get β from ﬁtting n(E) in the interval [Eini −
ǫ, Eini +ǫ], where Eini is the initial mean energy and ǫ is a
parameter to determine the range for ﬁtting. The inverse
temperature β does not vary signiﬁcantly for ǫ . 0.5 (see
below).

FIG. 6. Simulation results for he−βW i and e−βhW i as a func-
tion of the process rate γ (normalized to the slowest rate
γ0 = 2.6 × 10−4) for two diﬀerent random states |Φi (repre-
sented by squares and circles) used to determine the initial
states (see Eq. (14)). The system is a quantum ladder with
22 spins. The initial energy corresponds to the inverse tem-
perature β = 1.23 (see Fig. 2 (inset) in the main text).

Estimation of the work probability PW(W )

As mentioned in the main text, we have two non-trivial
distributions of energy, a ﬁnal and an initial one, from
which PW must be inferred. Without further assump-
tions, the attribution of a ﬁnal and an initial distribution
of energy to one distribution of work cannot be entirely
unique. Thus, we rely on a further assumption: The
probability distribution of work as arising from an ini-
tial δ distribution w.r.t. energy could in principle vary
strongly with the position Eini at which this initial dis-
tribution is peaked. Assuming that this is not the case
on the small regime where Pini(E) takes on non-negligible
values, the probability distributions of work and energy
are related as

Pﬁn(Eﬁn) =Z Pini(Eini) PW (Eﬁn − Eini) dEini .

(27)

Multiplying this equation by e−βEﬁn and integrating over
Eﬁn, followed by a change of variables Eﬁn → W + Eini
on the r.h.s. yields

R Pﬁn(Eﬁn) e−βEfin dEﬁn
=Z PW(W ) e−βW dW . (28)
R Pini(Eini) e−βEini dEini
Thus, the l.h.s. of Eq. (28) yields he−βWi based on
Pﬁn, Pini for diﬀerent sweep rates γ.

Estimations of he−βW i and e−βhW i

In order to calculate the left-hand side of Eq. (25),
i.e., he−βWi, we do not have to really calculate the work

probability. As explained before, the left-hand side can
be expressed as

he−βWi = R Pﬁn(Eﬁn) e−βEfin dEﬁn
R Pini(Eini) e−βEini dEini

Similarly, we have

.

(29)

hWi =Z Pﬁn(Eﬁn) Eﬁn dEﬁn −Z Pini(Eini) Eini dEini

= hEﬁni − hEinii

(30)

and

e−βhW i = e−β(hEfini−hEinii) .

(31)

Hence, the calculations of he−βWi and e−βhW i solely de-
pend on the data set obtained from the simulation.
Figure 6 presents the simulation results for he−βWi and
e−βhW i as a function of the process rate of the magnetic
ﬁeld imposed on the two legs of the ladder for 22 spins.
The inverse temperature β is set to 1.23 (see Fig. 2 in the
main text). Two diﬀerent random states are used to pre-
pare the initial state of the system. It can be seen that
he−βWi and e−βhW i calculated for these two diﬀerent ini-
tial states do not diﬀer much. Hence, it is suﬃcient to
study the Jarzynski relation only for one particular initial
state.

Error estimation of he−βW i

The main error of our overall analysis is set neither by
our numerical methods (ﬁnite time step, maximum time)
nor by the speciﬁc realization of the initial state. Instead,
the main error results when determining the inverse tem-
perature β by ﬁtting locally the density of states. By
varying the ﬁt range [Eini − ǫ, Eini + ǫ] from ǫ = 0.25 to
ǫ = 0.5, we ﬁnd that the value of β can be determined
with a precision of ≈ 5 %, see the small error bars in Fig.
4 (c) of the main text. This precision implies that, for
the sweep rate γ/γ0 = 40, the quantity he−βWi has a
corresponding error of ≈ 2 %. This error is smaller than
the symbol size used and not indicated explicitly in Fig.
4 (a) of the main text. We can therefore exclude that the
deviation of this quantity from 1 for such values of γ is
an artifact of our approach.

However, the corresponding error for the shift δE is

much larger since

δE = −

Finite-size scaling

8

A central result of our Letter concerns the upscaling of
the system towards the limit L → ∞. It is instructive to
compare to a set of M disconnected small systems: The
work-probability distribution in this case is a M -fold con-
volution of the work-probability distribution as resulting
for each small system. Since mean values are additive
under convolution, one gets the corresponding shift scal-
ing as δE(M ) = M δE(1). The standard deviation of the
work-probability distribution, however, scales under con-
volution as ∆E(M ) = √M ∆E(1). This implies that, for
large M , δE(M ) becomes inevitably larger than ∆E(M )
and thus the resulting work-probability distribution is
far away from fulﬁlling the JR. Therefore, in the limit of
many disconnected small systems, the JR is strongly vio-
lated whenever δE(1) is non-zero. This ﬁnding is clearly
diﬀerent to a long connected ladder, as discussed in our
Letter.
