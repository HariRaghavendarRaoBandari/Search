Abstract

Quenched and unquenched quark models predict very diﬀerent patterns for the spectrum of

the low excited hyperon states. Evidence is accumulating for the existence of some new hyperon

resonances, such as a Σ∗ of spin-parity J P = 1/2− around 1400 MeV instead of 1620 MeV as

listed in PDG, a new Σ(1540)3/2− resonance, a new narrow Λ(1670)3/2− resonance and a new

Λ(1680)3/2+ resonance. All these new hyperon resonances ﬁt in the predicted pattern of the

unquenched quark models very well. It is extremely important to check and establish the spectrum

of these low excited hyperon states by the proposed KL beam experiments at JLAB.

I. WHY HYPERON RESONANCES ?

Creation of quark-anti-quark pairs from gluon ﬁeld plays a crucial role for understanding

quark conﬁnement and hadron spectroscopy. In the classical quenched quark model for a

q1 ¯q1 meson, the q1 quark cannot be separated from the ¯q1 anti-quark due to a inﬁnitely large

conﬁnement potential. But in realty, we know the q1 and ¯q1 can be easily separated from

each other by creation of another quark-anti-quark pair q2 ¯q2 to decay to two mesons, q1 ¯q2

and q2 ¯q1. With the creation of the q2 ¯q2, instead of forming two colorless mesons, the system

could also exist in the form of a tetra-quark state [q1q2][¯q1 ¯q2]. Therefore both lattice QCD

and quark models should go beyond the quenched approximation which ignore the creation

of quark-anti-quark pairs.

Quenched qqq quark models and unquenched qqq ↔ qqqq ¯q quark models give very dif-

ferent predictions for the hyperon spectroscopy. For example, for the J P = 1

nonet partners of the N(1535) and Λ(1405). While quenched quark models [1–4] pre-

dict the J P = 1

−

Σ and Ξ resonances to be around 1650 MeV and 1760 MeV, respec-

tively, the unquenched quark models [5–7] expect them to be around 1400 MeV and 1550

MeV, respectively, a meson-soliton bound-state approach of the Skyrme model [8] and other

meson-baryon dynamical models [9, 10] predict them to be around 1450 MeV and 1620

MeV, respectively.

In Fig.1, we show prediction of the lowest penta-quark states with

J P = 1/2±, 3/2± [5, 6] (red solid) compared with those from the classical quenched qqq

model [1] (black solid). The major diﬀerences are that the lowest penta-quark hyperon

states with J P = 1/2− and 3/2+ are about 200 MeV lower those from the classical quenched

qqq models [1].

Although various phenomenological models give distinguishable predictions for the lowest

excited hyperon states, most of them are not experimentally established or even listed in

PDG [11]. Most of our knowledge for the hyperon resonances came from analyses of old KN

experiments in the 1970s [11]. In the new century, some new measurements from Crystal

Ball (CB) [12–14], LEPS [15] and CLAS [16] have started to provide us new information on

Σ∗ and Λ∗ resonances. It is crucial to use them to clarify the spectrum of low-lying hyperon

resonances to pin down the underlying dynamics for baryon spectrum and structure. Recent

analyses of these new data together with old data reveal some interesting new features of

the low-lying excited hyperon states. Here I will give a brief review of these new results and

discuss about their further conﬁrmation from the proposed KL beam and other experiments.

II. NEW RESULTS ON Σ∗ AND Λ∗ RESONANCES

A. On the lowest Σ∗ resonances with negative parity

The lowest Σ∗ resonances with J P = 1/2− or 3/2− are still far from established. There

is a Σ(1620) 1

listed as a 2-star resonance in the previous versions of PDG tables and

downgraded to 1-star in the newest version [11]. There is also a Σ(1580) 3

listed as 1-star

resonance [11].

The Σ(1620) 1

seems supporting the prediction of quenched quark models. However, for

the 2-star Σ(1620) 1

resonance, only four references [17–20] are listed in PDG tables with

weak evidence for its existence. Among them, Ref. [17] and Ref. [18] are based on multi-

channel analysis of the KN reactions. Both claim evidence for a Σ( 1

2

−

) resonance with mass

around 1620 MeV, but give totally diﬀerent branching ratios for this resonance. Ref. [17]

claims that it couples only to πΛ and not to πΣ while Ref. [18] claims the opposite way. Both

analyses do not have Σ(1660) 1

+ in their solutions. However, Ref. [21] shows no sign of Σ( 1

Later multi-channel analyses of the KN reactions support the existence of the Σ(1660) 1

instead of Σ(1620) 1

[11]. In Ref. [19], the total cross sections for K −p and K −n with all

proper ﬁnal states are analyzed and indicate some Σ resonances near 1600 MeV without

clear quantum numbers. Ref. [20] analyzes the reaction K −n → π−Λ and gets two possible

solutions, with one solution indicating a Σ( 1

2

−

) near 1600 MeV, and the other showing no

resonant structure below the Σ(1670). So all these claims of evidence for the Σ(1620) 1

2

−

are

very shaky. Instead, some re-analyses of the πΛ relevant data suggest that there may exist a

−

Σ( 1

2

) resonance around 1380 MeV [22], which supports the prediction of unquenched quark

models [5, 6]. This is supported by the new CLAS data on γp → KΣπ [16], although a more

delicate analysis [23] of the data suggests the resonant peak to be at a higher mass around

1430 MeV.

For the study of Σ resonances, the ¯KN → πΛ reaction is the best available channel, where

the s-channel intermediate states are purely hyperons with strangeness S = −1 and isospin

I = 1. Recently, high statistic new data for the reaction K −p → π0Λ are presented by

the Crystal Ball collaboration with the c.m. energy of 1560-1676 MeV for both diﬀerential

cross sections and Λ polarizations [13].

In order to clarify the status of the Σ(1620) 1

2

−

and the Σ(1660) 1

2

+, we analyzed the diﬀerential cross sections and Λ polarizations for both

K −p → π0Λ and K −n → π−Λ reactions with an eﬀective Lagrangian approach, using the

new Crystal Ball data on K −p → π0Λ with the c.m. energy of 1560-1676 MeV [13], and the

K −n → π−Λ data of Ref. [20] with the c.m. energy of 1550-1650 MeV, where the evidence

of the Σ(1620) 1

This analysis also suggests a possible Σ( 3

After our analysis, there were three groups [26–28] having made more sophisticated cou-
pled channel analysis of the ¯KN scattering data including those from the Crystal Ball ex-

periment. The newest analysis [28] gives roughly consistent results for the lowest Σ∗(1/2±)

resonances as ours. In both analyses, there is no Σ(1620)1/2−. While in our analysis, the

Σ(1635)1/2+ is deﬁnitely needed, in Ref.[28], the Σ(1635)1/2+ is split to two 1/2+ reso-

nances: Σ(1567) and Σ(1708). The other two analyses claim the need of the Σ(1620)1/2−,

but with much lower energy at 1501 MeV [26] and 1551 MeV [27], respectively.

For the lowest Σ∗(3/2−), Ref.[27] gives a similar result as ours with mass around 1550

MeV. Refs.[26, 28] give a higher mass around 1670 MeV.

So there are strong evidences for the lowest Σ∗(1/2−) to be in the range of 1380 ∼ 1500

MeV and the lowest Σ∗(3/2−) to be around 1550 MeV. But this is not conclusive.

B. On the lowest Λ∗(3/2±) resonances

Many studies have been carried out to investigate the Λ resonances. Oset et al. [29, 30]

used a chiral unitary approach for the meson-baryon interactions and got two J P = 1

2

−

resonances with one mass near 1390 MeV and the other around 1420 MeV. They believe the

well established Λ(1405) 1

2

−

resonance listed in PDG [11] is actually a superposition of these

−

two 1

2

resonances. Manley et al. [26] and Kamano et al. [27] made multichannel partial-

wave analysis of KN reactions and got results with some signiﬁcant diﬀerences. Zhong

et al. [31] analyzed the K −p → π0Σ0 reaction with the chiral-quark model and discussed

characteristics of the well established Λ resonances. Liu et al. [32] analyzed the K −p → ηΛ

reaction [12] with an eﬀective Lagrangian approach and implied a D03 resonance with mass

about 1670 MeV but much smaller width compared with the well established Λ(1690) 3

2

−

.

So there are still some ambiguities of the Λ resonant structures needing to be clariﬁed.

Recently, the most precise data on the diﬀerential cross sections for the K −p → π0Σ0

reaction have been provided by the Crystal Ball experiment at AGS/BNL [13, 14]. The Σ0

polarization data were presented for the ﬁrst time. However, with diﬀerent data selection

cuts and reconstructions, two groups in the same collaboration, i.e., VA group [14] and

UCLA group [13], got inconsistent results for the Σ0 polarizations. Previous multi-channel

analysis-[26, 27, 31] of the KN reactions failed to reproduce either set of the polarization

data.

5

In our recent work [33], we concentrate on the most precise data by the Crystal Ball

collaboration on the pure isospin scalar channel of KN reaction to see what are the Λ

resonances the data demand and how the two groups’ distinct polarization data [13, 14]

inﬂuence the spectroscopy of Λ resonances. Consistent diﬀerential cross sections of earlier

work by Armenteros et al. [34] at lower energies are also used. It is found that the 4-star

III. SUMMARY AND PROSPECTS

Taking into account new data from Crystal Ball (CB) [12–14], LEPS [15] and CLAS [16],

new analyses show strong evidences for the lowest Σ∗(1/2−) to be in the range of 1380 ∼ 1500

MeV, the lowest Σ∗(3/2−) to be around 1550 MeV and the lowest Λ∗(3/2+) to be around

1680 MeV. There is also evidence for a very narrow Λ∗(3/2−) around 1670 MeV decaying

to Λη. All these new hyperon resonances ﬁt in the expected pattern of unquenched quark

models very well. It is very important to pin down the existence of these new resonances.

Various processes could be used to study these hyperon resonances. The neutrino induced

hyperon production processes ¯νe/µ + p → e+/µ+ + π + Λ/Σ may provide a unique clean place

for studying low energy πΛ/Σ interaction and hyperon resonances below KN threshold [36].

With plenty production of Λc at BESIII, JPARC, BelleII, Λ+

c → π+π0Λ could also be used
to study Σ∗. The K −, KL beam experiments at JPARC and Jlab could provide an elegant

new source for Λ∗, Σ∗ and Ξ∗* hyperon spectroscopy. KLp → Λπ+, Σ0π+, Σ+π0, Σ∗0π+,

Σ∗+π0 could pin down the Σ∗(1540)3/2−; KLp → Σ0π0π+, Λπ0π+ could shed light on the

Σ ∗ (1380 ∼ 1500)1/2−, Σ∗(1540)3/2−, Λ∗(1680)3/2+; KLp → Σ0ηπ+, Ληπ+ may check

Σ∗(1380 ∼ 1500)1/2−, Σ∗(1540)3/2−, Λ∗(1670)3/2−. We believe the proposed KL beam

experiments at JLAB could settle down the spectrum of the low excited hyperon states

which provide complimentary information to the study of penta-quark states with hidden

charm [37, 38] and play a crucial role for understanding the hadron dynamics and hadron

structure.
