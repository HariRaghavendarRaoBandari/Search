Distinguishing Coherent States from Phase-Mixed Coherent States with Only a

Variable Beam Splitter and Single-Photon Detector, In Principle

The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD 20723, USA

(Dated: March 22, 2016)

Samuel R. Hedemann

It is generally assumed that on-oﬀ detectors with single-photon sensitivity cannot distinguish co-
herent states from phase-mixed coherent states without some form of quadrature-based tomography.
Here, we show that it is theoretically possible to distinguish these states without quadrature-based
methods by comparing the vacuum probability of one output port of a variable beam splitter (VBS)
that has two diﬀerent phase-mixed coherent states as its inputs to the well-known case of dual
coherent-state inputs. As an application, a method is proposed to test whether a laser ﬁeld is in a
coherent state over a given time by simply measuring the VBS output populations with an on-oﬀ
single-photon detector. Unfortunately, timing limitations of present technology prohibit such simple
tests, but the technique may become practical in the future.

INTRODUCTION

Since optical systems oﬀer a relatively aﬀordable
testbed for ideas in quantum mechanics, the action of a
variable beam splitter (VBS) has been studied for a wide
variety of input states of light. In particular, papers like
[1] have shown that the input state must be nonclassical
for a VBS to produce entanglement in the output state,
and have examined this proposition for a number of dif-
ferent inputs including Fock, coherent [2], squeezed [3, 4],
and thermal states. Others have investigated how to use
beam splitters to ﬁlter out Fock states under certain spe-
cial cases [5]. The VBS has even been investigated as a
means to realize the displacement operator [6].

The motivation for studying the VBS is that it acts as
a unitary operator that can be easily controlled, making
it an attractive tool for realizations of quantum-optical
computers, which is an active area of research, particu-
larly in the subjects of linear quantum optical computing
[7, 8] and quantum-Zeno optical computing [9].

The motivations for developing a quantum computer
[10] are well-documented, the chief reason being that
quantum computers may be able to solve certain kinds
of problems much more eﬃciently than classical comput-
ers. However, the production and control of pure quan-
tum states is very challenging, and it is often diﬃcult to
verify quantum features such as superposition that are
essential to quantum algorithms.

Here, we seek a method of verifying the purity of a co-
herent state subject only to phase-damping noise, with-
out using full tomography. Speciﬁcally, since a laser ﬁeld
is in a pure coherent state over small enough times [11],
we ask: can we verify that a laser ﬁeld is still in a pure
coherent state over a certain time using only linear op-
tics and an on-oﬀ detector? This is especially relevant
since lasers are vital for control in many implementations
of quantum computation. This question was in fact ad-
dressed by [12] in 1999, however their method relies on
quadrature measurements, which we seek to avoid here.
Over time, a laser ﬁeld’s phase does a random-walk,

yielding a phase-damping eﬀect which reduces all of the
oﬀ-diagonal elements of the density matrix to zero in the
Fock photon-number basis, leaving the probabilities un-
changed, the result of which is called a phase-mixed co-
herent state. Since these probabilities are the same as
those of the original pure coherent state, we cannot test
the purity of the laser ﬁeld by checking its probabilities.
Thus, in order to develop a simple method for distin-
guishing these two states, we now review their mathe-
matical descriptions as well as those of the VBS.

Recall that Glauber’s coherent states [2] are

where {|n(cid:105)} is the Fock basis, and α ≡ |α|eiϕ is complex,

Although coherent states exhibit many classical features,
they are still quantum in the sense of being pure states
possessing superposition. The truly classical counter-
parts to these states are the phase-mixed coherent states,

which we shall call Poisson states, where their classicality
comes from being diagonal in the Fock basis, meaning
that these mixed states are the results of coherent states
that have been fully phase-damped.
Recall also that Bθ ≡ eθ(a†b−ab†) is the unitary oper-
ator of a VBS (without a second phase shifter), where
annihilation operators a and b obey [a, a†] = 1 and
[b, b†] = 1 where [A, B] ≡ AB − BA, and correspond
to diﬀerent input ports of the VBS [13]. The action of
Bθ on a and b then gives the output operators as

†
a(cid:48) ≡ BθaB
θ = acθ − bsθ
†
b(cid:48) ≡ BθbB
θ = asθ + bcθ,

where cθ ≡ cos(θ) and sθ ≡ sin(θ). Then, using the
fact that |n(cid:105) = (a†)n√
|0(cid:105), and letting |A(cid:105)|B(cid:105) ≡ |A(cid:105) ⊗
|B(cid:105), where a operates on the left ket and b oper-
ates on the right ket, and recalling the unitary dis-
placement operator D(α) ≡ eαa†−α∗a such that |α(cid:105) =
D(α)|0(cid:105), and using the facts that |0(cid:105) = e−α∗a|0(cid:105) and
e|α|2 eαa†−α∗a, we get the well-known re-
eαa†
sult of applying a VBS to dual pure-coherent inputs as

e−α∗a =

√

Bθ|α(cid:105)|β(cid:105) = |αcθ + βsθ(cid:105)| − αsθ + βcθ(cid:105),

(5)

where β is also any complex number. Thus, a VBS trans-
forms the product of pure coherent states to a new prod-
uct of pure coherent states, whose complex parameters
are a unitary transformation of the complex input pa-
rameters, as depicted in Fig. 1.

transmittivity T is related to parameter θ by T = cos2(θ) ≡ c2

The ﬁrst question we wish to answer here is, what is the
output of a VBS acting on two diﬀerent Poisson states,
and can we do anything useful with it?. That is, given
these two very classical input states, can we distinguish
them from the coherent-state case to verify nonclassical
properties such as superposition using only classical mea-
surements of probability with an on-oﬀ detector? The
situation of interest is shown in Fig. 2.

Immediately, we see that (8) is diﬀerent from (6), re-
vealing that there is a diﬀerence in the VBS output prob-
abilities accessible to an on-oﬀ detector. Therefore we
now investigate these results visually to see if they are
diﬀerent enough to be useful in practice.

A. Comparison of Coherent Inputs and Poisson

Inputs to a Variable Beam Splitter

In particular, since single-photon detectors are the
most widely available detection devices, we will focus on

Since the output pulses of an ideal typical single-
photon detector describe nonvacuum events, meaning
collapses of the ﬁeld state onto outcomes other than the

0 and(cid:101)p ≡ 1 −(cid:101)p(1)

vacuum state, then here we will study the nonvacuum
probabilities p ≡ 1 − p(1)
0 . Our goal here
is to visually check whether there is any noticeable and

useful diﬀerence between p and (cid:101)p.

In fact, there is a noticeable diﬀerence, as seen in
Fig. 3, which uses the simplifying condition that |α|2 =
|β|2, which are the mean photon numbers of each input
beam for both the coherent case and the Poisson case.

(cid:101)p(1)

one must apply nonvacuum states to both inputs of the
VBS in order to obtain diﬀerent detection probabili-
ties in one of the output ports. To see why, putting
β = 0 into (6) and (8) produces p(1)
and
0 = e−|αcθ|2
, making the on-oﬀ output
statistics identical, and therefore useless to compare.
Note that nonvacuum probability p only relates to |α|2
as |α|2 = −ln(1− p) for both coherent and Poisson states
if p is measured for each single beam prior to the VBS.
Therefore, p∗ is a pre-VBS quantity.

Before using these results to develop a test, we now

view it oﬀers. The coherent-generated surface p is the one

generated surface (cid:101)p has four periods with θ.

The extreme cases when |α|2 = 0 and |α|2 = ∞ cause

ues. In particular, the case corresponding to p∗ = 0.85
gives |α|2 = −ln(1 − p∗) ≈ 1.9 which is a mean photon
number that approximately yields the most pronounced

diﬀerences between the behaviors of p and (cid:101)p.

As Fig. 3 shows,

Thus, while there are some points of intersection, as
seen in Fig. 3, it is permissible to suppose that, adjusting
to get |α|2 = |β|2 ≈ 1.9, one could then vary the VBS
angle θ and collect data to see which curve is obtained,
with the time-interval of interest being deﬁned by the
time-window over which the detector is allowed to oper-
ate during each Bernoulli trial of a binomial experiment.
We will discuss this in more detail later.
In practice, one can let |α|2 and |β|2 be diﬀerent
and use them as ﬁtting parameters for the data. How-
ever, one important limiting case should be avoided;

Here, we wish to look at the cases where the single-

beam nonvacuum output probabilities p and (cid:101)p are the

most diﬀerent, and check that they are reliably distin-
guishable, which would then license the creation of a
simple test to determine whether the input states were
coherent states or Poisson states.
In this section, we limit ourselves to the case where
|α|2 = |β|2 ≈ 1.9, and we assume that the input states
have been created from identical monochromatic laser
beams (the preparation of which we will discuss in more
detail soon), with a stable phase relationship.

Then, since small and unavoidable changes in path
length between the two beams will occur within the VBS,
if we use one beam as a reference, the other will have
some unknown classical phase shift with respect to that
beam. Thus, here we seek to determine whether there are
any dangerous classical phase shifts that would make the
nonvacuum probabilities of the two cases identical. If all
classical phase shifts produce curves distinguishable from
the Poisson case, then we have a robust simple test for
verifying the purity of the initial laser ﬁeld state.
To examine the eﬀects of classical phase shift, Fig. 4
examines the case where |α|2 = |β|2 ≈ 1.9 for vari-
ous diﬀerences between coherent-state phase angles χ ≡
arg(β)−arg(α) = φ−ϕ, where we arbitrarily assign ϕ = 0
as a reference. Although these are phase angles of coher-
ent states which are quantum states, it is well-known that
the expectation value of the electric ﬁeld operator for a
ﬁeld in a single-mode coherent state produces a classical
electric plane-wave ﬁeld with classical phase shift equal
to the phase angle of the coherent state, which is why we
refer to χ as a classical phase shift.

As Fig. 4 shows, under the speciﬁed conditions, the
coherent-generated curves p are reliably distinguishable

[90◦, 180◦] simply produces a horizontal translation of the
curves shown resulting in a qualitatively identical situa-
tion, and then χ ∈ [180◦, 360◦] simply causes the reverse
sequence of curves.

diﬀerent behaviors between p and (cid:101)p. This ﬁgure examines
|β|2 = −ln(1 − p∗), where p∗ = 0.85 causes the most visibly
the eﬀect of changing the relative phase angle χ ≡ φ − ϕ be-
χ = φ = arg(β). Note that (cid:101)p is unaﬀected by χ, and has
tween α and β, taking arg(α) = ϕ ≡ 0 as the reference so
from (cid:101)p, as long as θ is varied by at least 180◦, so that we see
enough of the curves to avoid the similarity of p(67.5◦) to (cid:101)p

twice as many periods with θ than p. Most importantly, this
plot shows that, under these conditions and if measurements
are separated at most by 45◦, we can reliably distinguish p

when θ ∈ [90◦, 180◦] and [270◦, 360◦].

The only case in Fig. 4 where the curves are even re-

motely similar is when χ = 67.5◦ since p and(cid:101)p have sim-

ilar shapes for two quadrants of θ, but then, for the other
two quadrants, the curves conveniently spread away with
diﬀerent curvatures and are easily distinguished.

Therefore, it does not matter what the classical phase
shift χ is; as long as one varies the VBS angle θ over at
least a half of its full period, then it should be possible
to get enough data to say which curve is being observed.
Now that we have veriﬁed that the two diﬀerent input
state-pairs can yield distinguishable results from a the-
oretical point of view, we need to brieﬂy consider some
practical concerns for implementing this in a lab, in par-
ticular, how do we prepare these input states?

1. Single Laser Beam Split into Two Beams (Fails)

This is the most natural idea to suggest, since it en-
sures a stable phase relationship between the two coher-
ent states after they are initially split from an input of
2α ⊗ ρ0 to a preliminary 50:50 beam splitter prior to
ρ√
entering the VBS, as shown in Fig. 5.

joint-beam state ρ, which is sent by mirrors M to the variable
beam splitter (VBS) which is a Mach-Zehnder interferometer
starting at B2. The VBS angle θ is realized by a phase-shifter
PS, and the VBS ends with B3. Finally, one output beam
goes to beam-dump BD, while the other output beam goes
to detector D, the output of which is processed by electronics
E. Although this method ensures stable relative phase for the
coherent-input case, it fails to produce a product of Poisson
inputs at ρ for the Poisson-input case, ultimately producing
the same vacuum probability as the coherent case at D.

The coherent-generated input to the VBS is then ρ =

2α, the action of the VBS on ρ yields
(1) = e−|α|2(1−s2θ), which is the same as the output for
the coherent case, making this setup useless.

2αϕ

The trouble here is that the input to the VBS is not a

product of Poisson states.

C. Appraisal of Various Input-State Preparations

Here we look at two simple ways of preparing input
states to the VBS and discuss their merits and faults
relative to the theoretical results we have just developed.
The ﬁrst seems the safest, but is found to fail completely,
while the second could yield a robust test of laser ﬁeld
purity if practical obstacles can be overcome.

2. Two Separate Identical Laser Beams (Succeeds but Fails)

The idea here is to use two separate lasers of the same
exact model and speciﬁcations as direct inputs to the
VBS, as shown in Fig. 6. The input for the coherent
case is then ρα ⊗ ραeiχ, where we treat the phase of ρα
as a reference so that arg(α) ≡ ϕ = 0, and eiχ is the
relative phase between the two beams. The principal
concern here is that χ will be arbitrarily varying over

time, possibly rapidly. Nevertheless, putting β = αeiχ in
(6), the output of the VBS will lead to
0 = e−|α|2(1+s2θcχ),
p(1)

which is the same as the quantity used to compute the
coherent-generated curves in Fig. 4.

of the laser phases are negligible over the time-window,
the time-evolution eﬀects will still cause the output to
be indistinguishable from that of Poisson inputs under
presently achievable conditions.

To show that (11) is a valid model of what to expect,
recall that the time-evolution of a coherent state in a
harmonic oscillator potential is

to test for laser ﬁeld state purity. All labels are the same as
in Fig. 5, except that here the VBS starts at B1 and ends at
B2, and we now have two lasers and two attenuators. For this
test to work, it is essential that the two lasers be exactly the
same model in every way, the mean wavelengths of each beam
must be known, and the detection time-window must be very
small, as discussed in the text.

In the case where both laser ﬁelds are Poisson states,
their input to the VBS is the desired Poisson product
ραϕ ⊗ ραχ, so that the VBS will produce
I0(|α|2s2θ).

While the output probabilities are now suﬃciently dif-
ferent to distinguish the two cases of input states, what
if relative phase χ varies randomly and rapidly? In that
case, only the coherent case is aﬀected, and our measure-
ments of p(1)

phase shifts in (9), yielding

So in order for this setup to be useful, we need to
ﬁnd conditions for which the phase diﬀerence between the
two lasers is relatively stable. Unfortunately, there are
two mechanisms working against us; the natural time-
evolution of coherent states will cause rapid periodic
changes in phase making it eﬀectively random, and the
two diﬀerent lasers are also subject to diﬀerent random
walks in their own phases. Even if the random walks

|α(t)(cid:105) = e

−i

ω

2 t|αe−iωt(cid:105),

(12)

where ω is the angular frequency of the ﬁeld and t is
time. Thus, supposing that the two lasers are atten-
uated to the same amplitude |α| but have slightly dif-
ferent frequencies ω1 and ω2, so that α1 ≡ |α|ei(ϕ−ω1t)
and α2 ≡ |α|ei(φ−ω2t), then from (6), we again obtain (9),
where now χ has time-dependence as

χ ≡ χ(t) = χ0 − (ω2 − ω1)t,

(13)
where χ0 ≡ φ− ϕ represents constant phase shifts due to
diﬀerences in path length between the two beams, and we
ignore eﬀects due to the separate random walks of each
laser phase.

Now, using the fact that ω2 − ω1 = 2πc( 1

), and
supposing that our two lasers only diﬀer by a small
1
fraction of nominal wavelength λ such as
100 λ, then if
λ2 = 635[nm] and λ1 = 635.01[nm], we get ω2 − ω1 ≈
4.67× 1010[ rad
s ]. Thus, if the detection time-windows are
typically on the order of 1[µs], then χ(t) will rotate with
an angular speed of 4.67 × 104[ rad
µs ], meaning that χ(t)
cycles through a full 2π radians nearly 7500 times per
1[µs]-detection time-window.

− 1

λ2

λ1

Therefore, over the sample time, the relative phase χ(t)
changes rapidly, and when a particular collapse happens
at the detector, the phase at that moment is picked from
a uniformly distributed set of angles over [0, 2π) because
the phase χ(t) is linear in t. Therefore, we are justiﬁed in
supposing that even small diﬀerences in the laser wave-
length will cause the measurements of the probability to
be an average over the relative phase angle χ(t).

One possible exception is if we happen to get ω2 = ω1
exactly. Then if the source is a coherent state, p will sim-
ply be one of the curves shown in Fig. 4, and the test will
work, indicating whether the random walks are negligible
over the detection time-window.

Another possible way this method could work is if the
lasers have tunable wavelengths with a ﬁne-enough reso-
lution to cause their relative phase shifts to be essentially
constant over the detection time-window. Unfortunately,
present tuning techniques only have down to 0.1[nm] res-
olution, so it would be very hard to achieve this condition
except by chance.

An interesting alternative would be to use chirping,
meaning the application of a high-speed phase shift by
changing the optical path length over time in a way that
cancels out the frequency-dependent evolution. Then, if
the chirping can be done reliably enough for each laser,
it would not matter whether their frequencies were the
same, since each state would have a constant net phase.

However, there is another way this could work. If one
has access to electronics capable of implementing detec-
tion time-windows on the order of 100[fs], then suppos-
ing that the lasers are nominally within 1
10 λ, so that for
instance, λ2 = 635[nm] and λ1 = 635.1[nm], then the re-
sulting angular speed of χ(t) would be 4.67× 10−2[ rad
100fs ],
meaning that χ(t) only changes by 0.00744 of a period, or
about 2.7◦ over the sample time. Unfortunately, typical
detectors have a dead time of about 100[ns], after which
the phases would have changed so much that it would be
hard to synchronize the next time window to fall at the
same part of the period of χ(t). Therefore, one would
need a specialized segmented detector capable of taking
a statistically signiﬁcant number of consecutive measure-
ments with zero eﬀective dead time between each, or else
a detector with dead time ≤ 100[fs]. Note that a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant number of measurements is the number
of Bernoulli trials that lets the error in the estimators of
the probabilities in the binomial experiment be accept-
able for a given application.

Thus, (9) and (10) show that when the classical phase
shift χ is relatively stable, the results of the setup in
Fig. 6 will be identical to those in Fig. 3 (where χ = 0)
and Fig. 4. However, since Fig. 6 uses two separate lasers
as inputs, under presently achievable conditions, the rel-
ative phase χ is likely to cause the probability measure-
ments to be an average over all values of χ, yielding (11),
so the coherent-input case would be indistinguishable
from the Poisson case. As explained above, technological
advances in the time-resolution of detectors could eventu-
ally make this test a feasible means of distinguishing the
cases of coherent vs. Poisson input. Otherwise, one must
use quadrature methods, as in [12]. Another method is
that of [15], but if limited to coherent or Poisson probes,
that only works if the beam splitter is variable, and one
reaches the same conclusions as the present work.

At the very least, it is interesting to note that, from
an instantaneous perspective, the coherent case actually
has diﬀerent vacuum probabilities than the Poisson case.
This is fascinating from a theoretical point of view be-
cause these kinds of highly simple on-oﬀ measurements
are not usually enough to distinguish these two kinds of
states. Therefore the problems we encountered are only
practical diﬃculties, and may eventually be overcome as
the state of technology advances, making this method
ultimately more useful in that case.

III. CONCLUSIONS

The main result of this paper is that if high-enough
time resolution can be achieved in the measurement pro-
cess, then it is possible to distinguish coherent states
from phase-mixed coherent states (Poisson states) using
only a variable beam splitter (VBS) and a single-photon
on-oﬀ detector. The reason this is possible is that the
vacuum probability for one output beam of the VBS is
generally diﬀerent for the two cases where the input to

6

the VBS is a product of coherent states or a product
of Poisson states, as shown in Sec. II A. Therefore, the
case of product-Poisson input was certainly worthwhile
to study since it yields a simple test to verify whether a
particular laser is truly in a pure coherent state over a
given detection time-window.

Then in Sec. II B, we took a closer look at phase shifts
in the coherent-state input case, and veriﬁed that the re-
sulting detection probabilities are reliably distinguishable
from those of the Poisson-input case, provided that that
the mean photon numbers of each beam are not too close
to zero, and not so large than they cause their respective
beams’ detection probabilities to be close to 1.
It was
found that choosing a nonvacuum detection probability
for each independent beam of approximately p∗ = 0.85
produces a favorable condition for getting useful results.
This section implicitly assumed that the phases of each
input beam in the coherent case were constant with re-
spect to each other, but later in Sec. II C, we investigated
the case of time-dependent phase.

Section II C investigated two simple proposals to re-
alize a test to distinguish coherent states from Poisson
states based on the results of Sec. II A and Sec. II B. The
ﬁrst method in Sec. II C 1 uses a preliminary beam split-
ter and mirrors to prepare inputs to the VBS that have a
stable phase relationship in the coherent-input case since
they come from a single beam. However, it was shown
in App. B and App. C that the vacuum probabilities at
the detector would be identical for both cases of coherent
input and Poisson input. The problem was seen to arise
from the fact that the preliminary 50:50 beam splitter’s
action on a Poisson state does not cause a product of
Poisson states, but rather it causes a two-beam nondiag-
onal joint state, as shown in (B1). Therefore, the setup
shown in Fig. 5 is useless for the desired test.

An alternative was then given in Sec. II C 2, which con-
sidered a two-laser input to the VBS as shown in Fig. 6.
This test requires that the two lasers be the exact same
model, and allows the product of Poisson inputs to be
realizable if the lasers’ phase diﬀusion occurs much more
rapidly than the given time-window. However, the use
of two separate lasers will result in a slight diﬀerence
in wavelength of their ﬁelds due to unavoidable diﬀer-
ences in laser construction, temperature, etc. Thus, un-
der typical conditions, the natural time-evolution of co-
herent states would cause the relative phase between the
two input ﬁelds to vary rapidly over the detection time-
window. The instantaneous output probability is then a
function of time, due to its dependence on relative phase,
and since this phase is a uniformly distributed random
variable, the estimator of the probability will be a time
average of the instantaneous function, resulting in prob-
abilities that make the two cases of coherent input and
Poisson input indistinguishable, despite their instanta-
neous diﬀerences.

However, Sec. II C 2 then considered the conditions for
which a typical laser could be tested that would avoid
the problems of eﬀective phase averaging due to time-

evolution, and found that if the data acquisition electron-
ics are capable of time-windows on the order of 100[fs],
and if the detector has dead times (or eﬀective dead times
if partitioned) on this timescale as well, then it would
be possible to observe the diﬀerences between the two
kinds of input states using this method. Since this time-
resolution is not currently widely available and may not
be presently possible, this method must only be consid-
ered a theoretical curiosity unless further advances are
made in electronics. However, since it was not previously
thought that on-oﬀ statistics could distinguish coherent
states from Poisson states, then this at least advances
our understanding of what is theoretically possible.

Throughout this treatment, detectors were treated as
ideal, but a real detector can be modeled as an ideal de-
tector preceded by a VBS with transmittivity T = η,
where η is the quantum eﬃciency of the detector. For
an even more realistic model, the auxiliary input to this
VBS (perpendicular to the detector) can be thought of as
a thermal state with its mean photon number chosen so
that it explains the dark counts measured by the detec-
tor, found by setting the primary input to vacuum and
measuring the counts. However, in most cases, single-
photon detectors are thermo-electrically cooled to the
point where the dark counts are negligible, meaning that
a pure state at the primary input will be almost perfectly
transmitted to the imaginary ideal detector. Speciﬁcally,
the mixture induced by the thermal state modeling the
dark noise will be a mixed state where the pure state
with the largest probability is the primary input state,
and its probability will be very near 1.

Certainly there are other ways to see if a laser’s ﬁeld
is in a coherent state, and many others have done this.
However, the goal here was to design a simple test with
a minimum of hardware. The proposed setup in Fig. 6
ﬁts the bill nicely, with the only drawbacks being that
two identical lasers are needed which then requires ultra-
fast electronics to resolve the changes due to the time-
dependent relative phase. Nevertheless, as detection de-
vices improve, this test may become feasible.

Since this paper is a theoretical treatment only,

it
would be interesting to see an experimental implemen-
tation of this test, though it is likely to be diﬃcult to
achieve the time-resolution needed. Hopefully, when elec-
tronics have improved to the time-sensitivity required,
this proposed test will serve as a relatively quick and
inexpensive method for verifying that a particular laser
device is adequate as a source of coherent (or Poisson)
states for a given application.

subject to m = k − n, r = k − q, and t = k − s. For
the m sum, the fact that the original sum extended to
∞ means that the m = k − n ≤ ∞ will simply pick that
term out of the sum.
However, the situation is slightly diﬀerent for the other
sums. For the r sum, we have r ≤ m, which becomes
r ≤ k − n. But then, applying r = k − q, we get k − q ≤
k − n, which leads to q ≥ n, and since the q sum has an
inherent upper limit of n, then this means that only the
equality case of q = n survives, so that these constraints
eﬀectively act as δq,nδr,k−n, where the second delta is
due to the constraint r = k − q with q = n applied to

can use (A2 + B2)k to derive an alternate form for each

standard appearance. Also, due to the right sides of
(A13) all being the same, all the left sides are equal to

Appendix B: Outputs of a 50:50 Beam Splitter with

Poisson State and Vacuum Inputs

fully phase-damped laser ﬁeld does not yield a product
of Poisson states after a 50:50 beam splitter. That is the
motivation for the modiﬁed test suggested in Fig. 6.

Here, we will brieﬂy show that when a Poisson state
enters a 50:50 beam splitter with the vacuum state |0(cid:105)
at the other input port, the joint-beam state is not a
product of Poisson states, but if one measures one of the
beams, then the other will be in a Poisson state.

VBS with Joint Beam Input Made from 50:50 Split

of Poisson and Vacuum

First, since (7) is the output of a VBS given two Pois-
son inputs, then here, we simply set β = 0 to get vacuum
on one of the inputs, and set θ = 45◦ to get 50:50 be-
havior from the VBS. Then, 0m acts as δm,0 since only
00 = 1 in that sum, so m = 0, which also causes δr,0 and

Notice that (B1) is not diagonal in each subsystem, and
therefore cannot be a product of Poisson states, which
would have to be diagonal.

To get the state of a single output beam, apply the
partial trace over subsystem 2, which introduces δq,k and
δs,k which can be handled by ﬁrst applying the eﬀective
δq,s and then applying δq,k, which results in

where our notation in the last line comes from (3), and

The important thing to note here is that one cannot
make a product of Poisson states by applying a 50:50
beam splitter to a Poisson state in product with the vac-
uum. This means that although the vacuum probability
of the output of a VBS with product-Poisson inputs is
diﬀerent from that caused by product-coherent inputs, a

Here, we will derive the output we should expect from
a VBS when the input is a joint-beam state ρ prepared
by sending a Poisson state in product with the vacuum
ραϕ ⊗ ρ0 into a 50:50 beam splitter (BS). The input to
the VBS is ρ as shown just prior to B2 in Fig. 5, and was
given in (B1).

Our goal now is to ﬁnd the joint-beam output state
of the VBS when its input is ρ from (B1). Thus, com-
†
θ, and using the binomial theorem to
handle the action of Bθ on the creation and annihila-
tion operators, after some reorganization, we arrive at
the joint-beam output state,

which introduces Kronecker deltas δw+x,k, δy+z,k, δw+x,n,
δy+z,n, where k is from the sum of the partial trace.
These deltas eﬀectively also cause δk,n, which picks k = n
out of the k sum, and lets us begin by picking x = k−w =
n − w and z = k − y = n − y out of the x and z sums.
However, an important point to notice, for example, is
that since the limits of the z sum are z = 0 and z = s,
then when we pick z = n− y out of that sum, this causes
the limit values to yield equations n−y = 0 and n−y = s,
which if solved for y produces a restriction on allowable
values of y to be n − s ≤ y ≤ n. But the existing sum
on y already places the restriction that 0 ≤ y ≤ n − s,
therefore the only value of y that is allowed between these
two restrictions is y = n − s, so we see that we have an
eﬀective δy,n−s. Similarly, we also get an eﬀective δw,n−q.

one of the output beams from a VBS that has acted on

a joint-beam input ρ ≡ B45◦ (ραϕ ⊗ ρ0)B
45◦ which is the
output of a 50:50 BS acting on the product state ραϕ⊗ρ0,
where ραϕ is a Poisson state and ρ0 ≡ |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0|.

Since (C3) is the vacuum probability that would be
measured at the detector after the VBS after the origi-
nal laser ﬁeld has completely phase-damped to a Poisson
state, but is equal to that same quantity for the coherent-
input case, this shows that the method in Fig. 5 is useless
as a test for laser ﬁeld purity.
