We present the phase diagram and associated ﬁxed points for a wide class of Gauge-Yukawa
theories in d = 4 +  dimensions. The theories we investigate involve non-abelian gauge ﬁelds,
fermions and scalars in the Veneziano-Witten limit. The analysis is performed in steps, we start
with QCDd and then we add Yukawa interactions and scalars which we study at next-to- and
next-to-next-to-leading order.
Interacting infrared ﬁxed points naturally emerge in dimensions
lower than four while ultraviolet ones appear above four. We also analyse the stability of the
scalar potential for the discovered ﬁxed points. We argue for a very rich phase diagram in three
dimensions while in dimensions higher than four certain Gauge-Yukawa theories are ultraviolet
complete because of the emergence of an asymptotically safe ﬁxed point.

INTRODUCTION

There has been recent interest in the conformal struc-
ture of gauge theories in d = 4 +  dimensions with spe-
cial attention to QEDd [1]. It has also been noticed that
QED3 can be viewed as the continuum limit of spin sys-
tems [2].

Of particular interest are applications to phase transi-
tions with multiple order parameters such as conﬁnement
and chiral symmetry breaking [3, 4] at nonzero ﬁnite tem-
perature and matter density. Analyses in d = 4 +  re-
vealed intriguing possibilities such as the possible occur-
rence of tetracritical-type phase transitions [5]. Related
recent studies appeared in [6–8]. Away from four dimen-
sions nonabelian gauge theories have been studied in [9–
13], the non-linear sigma model in [14] and scalar QED3
in [15]. Similarly quantum gravity has been investigated
in general dimensions in [16–18].

Our goal is to go beyond the present knowledge by
simultaneously extending the perturbative analysis be-
yond the leading order and by including gauge-singlet
scalar degrees of freedom. The latter are in the form of

complex scalar Higgs matrices that are bi-fundamental
with respect to the global symmetry group. In this ini-
tial investigation we work in the Veneziano-Witten limit
of inﬁnite number of ﬂavors and colors to neatly uncover
the salient properties.

In four dimensions a similar analysis has led to the
discovery of the ﬁrst nonsupersymmetric class of asymp-
totically safe quantum ﬁeld theories [19]. Furthermore
the quantum corrected potential was determined in [20]
while basic thermodynamic properties were uncovered in
[21]. The nonperturbative dynamics of supersymmetric
cousin theories in four dimensions was analysed in [22],
further generalising or correcting the results of [23]. Here
it was nonperturbatively shown that the supersymmet-
ric versions of the theories investigated in [19] cannot be
asymptotically safe. The discovery of asymptotically safe
ﬁeld theories in four dimensions has far reaching conse-
quences for model building [24–26].

The work is organized as follows. We brieﬂy introduce
the Lagrangian for a general class of Gauge-Yukawa the-
ories in Section II together with the Veneziano-Witten
rescaled couplings. Here we also discuss some general
features of the β functions of this class of theories in
d = 4 +  dimensions. In Section III, as a stepping stone
we consider ﬁrst the interesting case of QCDd. We then
upgrade it to the full Gauge-Yukawa system in Section
IV. We will consider the full Gauge-Yukawa system at
both the next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-

to-leading order (NNLO). We oﬀer our conclusions and
general considerations in Section V.

II. GAUGE-YUKAWA THEORY TEMPLATE

µ with associated ﬁeld strength F a

Our starting point is the general class of Gauge-
Yukawa theories that,
in four dimensions, constitutes
the back-bone of the standard model of particle inter-
actions. We consider an SU (NC) gauge theory featuring
gauge ﬁelds Aa
µν, NF
Dirac fermions Qi (i = 1,··· , NF ) transforming accord-
ing to the fundamental representation of the gauge group
(color-index muted), and an NF × NF complex matrix
scalar ﬁeld H uncharged under the gauge group. We take
the fundamental action to be the same as in [19, 27], such
that the Lagrangian is the sum of the following terms:

LYM = − 1

2 Tr F µνFµν

LF = Tr(cid:0)Q i /D Q(cid:1)
LY = y Tr(cid:0)QLHQR + QRH†QL

LH = Tr (∂µH† ∂µH)
LU = −u Tr (H†H)2
LV = −v (Tr H†H)2 .

(cid:1)

(1)

Tr is the trace over both color and ﬂavor indices, and
2 (1 ±
the decomposition Q = QL + QR with QL/R = 1
γ5)Q is understood. In four dimensions, the model has
four classically marginal coupling constants given by the
gauge coupling g, the Yukawa coupling y, the quartic
scalar coupling u and the ‘double-trace’ scalar coupling
v, which we write as:

αg =

αh =

g2 NC

(4π)d/2Γ(d/2)

(4π)d/2Γ(d/2)

u NF

(4π)d/2Γ(d/2)

, αv =

v N 2
F

(4π)d/2Γ(d/2)

,

.

(2)

We have normalized the couplings with the appropriate
powers of NC and NF so that the limit of inﬁnite number
of colors and ﬂavours with NF /NC a real ﬁnite number
(Veneziano-Witten limit) is well deﬁned. In dimensions
diﬀerent from four the couplings are dimensionful. We
will denote by βi with i = (g, y, h, v) the β-functions for
the dimensionless version of the couplings in (2), which
we will still call αi for simplicity. We express the β
functions in terms of

δ =

NF
NC

− 11
2

,

2

Since we perform the -expansion around four dimen-
sions, we require the β-functions to abide the Weyl con-
sistency conditions [27–29]. This implies that, at the LO,
one only needs to consider the one-loop corrections to the
gauge coupling. We denote this order with (1,0,0,0) to
indicate zero loops in the other three couplings. There-
fore to LO the Gauge-Yukawa system reduces to the LO
of QCDd. We will also consider the phase diagram, be-
yond the LO, for QCDd in section III. At the NLO the
Gauge-Yukawa system (2,1,0,0) can be simpliﬁed by ﬁrst
setting the Yukawa β function to zero. This allows to
write the Yukawa coupling, at the ﬁxed point, as func-
tion of the gauge coupling. One can then substitute into
the gauge β function. To this order we can anticipate the
generic form of the associated ﬁxed points by analysing
the expected two-loop gauge-beta function in terms of
the gauge coupling. The situation is more involved at
the NNLO. At LO the gauge β-function in d = 4 +  does
not depend on the Yukawa coupling and reads

βg = αg − Bα2
g .

(4)

In four dimensions, i.e.  = 0, and to this order the theory
displays only a non-interacting ﬁxed point. For B > 0
it corresponds to asymptotic freedom and for B < 0 to
an infrared free theory. Away from four dimensions, i.e.
 (cid:54)= 0, we have a Gaussian ﬁxed point (G) and a non-
Gaussian ﬁxed point (NG) given by

αG

g = 0 ,

αNG

g =

B

(5)

Above four dimensions an ultraviolet safe ﬁxed point
emerges for B > 0 and vice-versa for B < 0 the interact-
ing ﬁxed point becomes an infrared one. That means that
an asymptotically free theory in four dimensions leads to
an asymptotically safe one in higher dimensions while an
infrared free leads to a theory with an interacting ﬁxed
point in dimensions lower than four. At the NLO, and
upon having substituted the Yukawa coupling as function
of the gauge coupling into the gauge beta function, the
eﬀective gauge β-function reads
g = αg − Bα2

g + Cα3

g .

(6)

In four dimensions for B > 0 one achieves an interact-
ing IR ﬁxed point for α∗
g = B/C with C > 0. When
asymptotic freedom is lost, B < 0, the theory can have
an asymptotically safe UV ﬁxed point at α∗
g = B/C for
C < 0 [19]. Away from four dimensions, i.e.  (cid:54)= 0, at
the NLO we have at most three ﬁxed points: a Gaus-
sian ﬁxed point (G) and two non-Gaussian ﬁxed points
(NG±) given by

which in Veneziano-Witten limit is a continuous param-
eter taking values in the interval [− 11

fects of introducing a small, but positive  to four-dimensions,
i.e. moving towards higher dimensions. In this case, the Gaus-
sian UV ﬁxed point splits into a Gaussian IR ﬁxed point and
a interacting UV ﬁxed point.

where ∆ = B2−4C. In ﬁgure (1) we show the β-function
of (6) with and without the linear term in αg.
In d = 4, perturbativity of the non-Gaussian (either IR
or UV) ﬁxed point is guaranteed for |B| (cid:28) 1 and |C| of
order unity [30]. The situation changes when we go away
from four-dimensions. By inspecting (7) we can consider
diﬀerent regimes. The ﬁrst is the one in which  vanishes
more rapidly than |B|2 (proportional to δ2). This regime
is a slight modiﬁcation of the four dimensional case. To
be able to extend our analysis to ﬁnite values of  (ide-
ally achieving integer dimensions above and below four),
we need B2 > |C|. For the case B2 (cid:29) |C| and C of
g (cid:39) /B
order unity, we have a perturbative ﬁxed point α∗
g (cid:39) B/C. Only when
and a non-perturbative one at α∗
B/C > 0 the second ﬁxed point is physical. The ﬁrst
one is physical when  and B have the same sign. Also,
a negative  corresponds to having an UV ﬁxed point
for vanishing couplings. When both non-Gaussian ﬁxed

points are physical, they are separated by
will thus merge when ∆ = 0. A near conformal behaviour
is expected for very small negative values of ∆ since the
β-function almost crosses zero. This situation, however,
is very diﬀerent from the four-dimensional case (see [31]
for a recent review) because: i) it arises away from four
dimensions; ii) it can appear already at two-loop level

√

We will discuss the scaling exponents when we have ex-
plicit forms for B,C in the next sections.

III. QCDd

Here we elucidate the phase diagram for QCDd be-
fore embarking on the phase diagram of the full Gauge-
Yukawa theory in the next sections.

The term linear in αg and proportional to  appears when
rendering dimensionless the coupling in d = 4 +  dimen-
sions via the replacement αi → µαi with µ the RG scale.
In addition to the simple zero at the origin αG
g = 0, the
beta function of (9) has a non-trivial zero at

g = − 3

(10)

Positivity of αg requires that below (above) four dimen-
sions we must have δ > 0 (δ < 0). In dimensions higher
than four the non-interacting ﬁxed point is IR while the
interacting one is UV safe. In dimensions lower than four
the UV and IR roles are inverted. Diﬀerently from the
four-dimensional case perturbativity is guaranteed by a
non-vanishing value of δ for any nonzero and small .
Larger values of δ, implying going away from the asymp-
totic freedom boundary in four-dimensions, naively seem
to allow larger values of  that could potentially assume
integer values1. This is, however, unsupported by a care-
ful analysis of higher order corrections. At each new or-
der higher powers of δ appear. They are organised as
shown in [33, 34] and therefore in the inﬁnite δ limit the
couplings must be properly redeﬁned. We shall not con-
sider this limit here and we will analyze our results for

1 One could naively consider arbitrary large positive values of δ
because we can have Nf (cid:29) Nc. On the other hand the smallest
negative value of δ occurs for Nf = 0 corresponding to δ =
−11/2.

ﬁnite values of δ. We will however further test the sta-
bility of our results by comparing LO, NLO and NNLO
approximations when assuming integer values of . The
LO scaling exponents are θG =  and θNG = − for either
signs of , and do not depend on δ. Clearly for positive 
the interacting ﬁxed point is UV safe since the scaling ex-
ponent is negative indicating a relevant direction driving
away from it.

that the interacting ﬁxed points αNG±

mensions higher than four, i.e. with  > 0. Otherwise, B
and C have opposite signs, and one of the two couplings
is unphysical being negative. Furthermore by tuning δ
the interacting ﬁxed points disappear via a merging phe-
nomenon. The condition for this to happen is obtained
by setting ∆ = 0, or more explicitly

The full four loop investigation in four dimensions of the
phase diagram of QCD like theories has been performed
in [33]. It can serve as basis, in the future, to go beyond
the NLO analysis away from four dimensions.

IV. GAUGE YUKAWA

We will now move to the full Gauge-Yukawa system.
As already noticed, at LO it coincides with LO-QCDd.
At the NLO the Yukawa coupling starts playing an im-
portant role [19] aﬀecting the phase diagram of the the-
ory. The quartic couplings αh and αv will be relevant at
the NNLO discussed in section IV B.

It is clear that the /δ expansion is not supported at the

Phase diagram. To illustrate our results we now dis-
cuss the overall phase diagram for the limiting physical
cases of ﬁve and three dimensions.

In Fig. 2 we present the NLO phase diagram for d = 5.
For negative values of δ we observe three ﬁxed points, the
Gaussian (G), the non-Gaussian (NG−) and the Yukawa
non-Gaussian (YNG−) in the (αg, αy)-plane. The ﬁrst
ﬁxed point is IR attractive in both directions while the
second is UV attractive in both directions. The third
one has a relevant direction (with negative scaling expo-
nent) and an irrelevant one. Along the relevant direction
it constitutes an asymptotically safe ﬁxed point. This
phase diagram is very similar to the one considered in
[19] and points towards the possible existence of a fun-
damental ﬁve dimensional Gauge-Yukawa theory.

For the d = 3 case, the purely Yukawa ﬁxed point (YG)
occurs on the αy axis but now G is an UV ﬁxed point
while YNG− is an IR one. Both YG and NG− are of
mixed character with one of the two couplings vanishing.
This is a safety-free situation similar to the one uncovered
in four dimensions in [36]. In the IR they also both ﬂow
to the same theory, i.e. to the ﬁxed point YNG− which
is attractive from both directions.

Phase diagrams and scaling exponents. We now inves-
tigate the NNLO phase diagrams and explore the eﬀects
of the scalar self-couplings. We will comment on the re-
liability of the NLO physical picture that emerged previ-
ously when assuming integer values of . Figure 3 shows
the NNLO version of the phase diagrams in three and
ﬁve dimensions. A comparison with their NLO counter-

parts, shown in Figure 2, manifest a certain stability: in
the (αg, αy)-plane the ﬁxed points and the ﬂow is quali-
tatively unchanged. But the new scalar directions aﬀects
the nature of the ﬁxed points. In d = 3, as can be seen
from Table II, only G remains a complete UV-trivial ﬁxed
point while YG and NG− acquire two relevant directions
in the scalar self-couplings. Two relevant directions are

added also to YNG−. We thus conclude that in three
dimensions scalar self-couplings increase the dimension
of the critical surface of YNG− and that the IR conse-
quently reduces predictivity.

The d = 5 dimension case is quite interesting since,
as it is clear from Table III, both G and YNG− don’t
change their character: the ﬁrst remains a complete IR
ﬁxed point while the second displays complete asymp-
totic safety with only one relevant direction. NG− adds
two irrelevant directions to the previous two relevant
ones. For the asymptotically safe ﬁxed point YNG− one
observes that the scaling exponents do not change much
at the NNLO compared to the NLO case. The overall
picture is that there is encouraging evidence for a ﬁve di-
mensional complete asymptotically safe Gauge-Yukawa
theory.

Stability of the scalar potential. Here we will analyze
the eﬀect of adding loop contributions to the beta func-
tions of the quartic couplings.
In order for the scalar
potential to be stable in the Veneziano-Witten limit, we
need [20]

system we predict for the pure Yukawa ﬁxed point in
three dimensions that δ is in the range [−4.5,−5.5] while
the couplings are αg = 0, αy ∼ 0.25, αu ∼ −αv ∼ 0.12.
For the interacting ﬁxed point, the prediction is that δ is
in the range [1.5, 4] while the couplings are αg ∼ 0.7, αy ∼
0.25, αu ∼ −αv ∼ 0.4. We see that naively maintaining
the condition for four dimensional stability of the scalar
potential in three dimensions requires non-perturbative
values of the ﬁxed points. Furthermore new superﬁcially
relevant operators can occur in three dimensions, which
might change the stability condition (22). We checked,
via direct NNLO computation, that pushing for large
negative values of  is challenging from the scalar po-
tential stability point of view. In ﬁve dimensions, as we
shall see, the system is less constrained resulting into a
stable scalar potential at the asymptotically safe ﬁxed
point.
In the analysis at NLO, we found that
the gauge coupling crosses its lower bound αg ≥ /6 at
the critical value δ∗ (17). For the NNLO system this
lower bound has changed into

Solving the subsystem of the quartic couplings fulﬁll-
ing this constraint, we ﬁnd a required bound on the
Yukawa coupling αy ≥ − 
4 . At the equality, we have
αu = −αv =
2 + δ. Hence, stability of the scalar
potential puts a lower bound on the Yukawa coupling in
dimensions lower than four. At the same time, it seems
that in order to have small quartic couplings, we need δ
negative. Combining this with the NLO Gauge-Yukawa

If we solve the gauge beta function with Yukawa and
quartic couplings set to zero, we can ﬁnd a relation in
δ() for which the equality is exactly true. This curve is
shown on Figure 4 together with the corresponding lower
bound on α∗
g (23). The critical value at NNLO evaluates
to δ∗ = −4.98 at  = 1. In the phase diagram shown in
Figure 3 we use δ = δ∗ + 0.1 = −4.88. We can now set
up an expansion around δ∗. In this way, we will develop

limit and in perturbation theory.

In d = 5 the consistency between the NLO and NNLO
phase diagrams points to the existence of an asymptoti-
cally safe ﬁxed point. This result extends the discovery
of asymptotic safe Gauge-Yukawa theories beyond four
dimensions [19].

In three dimensions we found a rich phase diagram fea-
turing, besides the UV non-interacting ﬁxed point, sev-
eral ﬁxed points with the fully interacting one attractive
in two directions but repulsive in the other two, rendering
the theory less predictive in the deep infrared.

Our analysis constitutes a step forward towards a sys-
tematic study of the phase diagram of Gauge-Yukawa
theories in several space-time dimensions.

in 5D with perturbative control for the three couplings
(αy, αu, αv). For a theory with δ = δ∗ + x, where x (cid:28) 1,
the Yukawa coupling emerges as linear in x, while the
quartic couplings (αu, αv) are sub-leading, x2 and x4.
The coeﬃcient of αu is positive, while it is negative for
αv. Hence, the constraints (22) are satisﬁed.
