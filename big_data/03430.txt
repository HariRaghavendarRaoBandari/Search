An interesting possibility for dark matter is a scalar particle of mass of order 10 MeV – 1 GeV,
interacting with a U (1) gauge boson (dark photon) which mixes with the photon. We present a
simple and natural model realizing this possibility. The dark matter arises as a composite pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone boson (dark pion) in a non-Abelian gauge sector, which also gives a mass to the
dark photon. For a ﬁxed non-Abelian gauge group, SU (N ), and a U (1) charge of the constituent
dark quarks, the model has only three free parameters: the dynamical scale of the non-Abelian gauge
theory, the gauge coupling of the dark photon, and the mixing parameter between the dark and
standard model photons. In particular, the gauge symmetry of the model does not allow any mass
term for the dark quarks, and stability of the dark pion is understood as a result of an accidental
global symmetry. The model has a signiﬁcant parameter space in which thermal relic dark pions
comprise all of the dark matter, consistently with all experimental and cosmological constraints. In
a corner of the parameter space, the discrepancy of the muon g − 2 between experiments and the
standard model prediction can also be ameliorated due to a loop contribution of the dark photon.
Smoking-gun signatures of the model include a monochromatic photon signal from the rare decay
of Υ into a photon and a “dark rho meson.” Observation of two decay modes of Υ, the mode into
the dark photon and that into the dark rho meson, would provide strong evidence for the model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The identity of the dark matter of the universe is un-
known. An interesting possibility is that it is a relatively
light particle of mass of order 10 MeV – 1 GeV, interact-
ing with the standard model particles through a U (1)
gauge boson (dark photon) that mixes with the pho-
ton [1, 2]. This avoids stringent constraints from dark
matter direct detection experiments [3, 4] while still al-
lows for understanding the current dark matter abun-
dance as the thermal relic from the early universe, if the
mixing between the dark and standard model photons is
adequately suppressed.

This potentially elegant scenario, however, suﬀers from
the issue of naturalness. First of all, if the dark matter
is a fermion, then the constraint on its late annihilations
from observations of the cosmic microwave background
excludes the scenario [5–7]. This (essentially) forces the
dark matter to be a scalar, in which case the constraint
is avoided because of the p-wave suppression of the anni-
hilation cross section [8]. This, however, raises the ques-
tion: why do we have such a light scalar? This is puzzling,
especially given that a scalar mass is generally unstable
under quantum corrections. A similar question can also
be raised for the dark photon, whose mass must be in
the same range as the scalar mass for phenomenological
reasons.

In this paper, we present a simple model addressing
this issue, in which the dark matter arises as a “dark
pion” of new gauge interactions with the dynamical scale
Λ ≈ O(10 MeV – 1 GeV). The dark photon is introduced
by gauging a U (1) subgroup of the ﬂavor symmetry of
this sector so that its mass is generated by the same
dynamics as the one forming the dark pion. The model
has the following salient features:

• Gauge symmetry of the model does not allow any

mass term for the constituent “dark quarks.” The
model, therefore, is fully (i.e. not only technically)
natural—the masses of all the new particles arise
from the dynamics of new gauge interactions.

• Despite the lack of dark quark masses, all the new
particles of the model have nonzero masses. In par-
ticular, both the dark pion and dark photon obtain
masses of the same order, ≈ eDΛ/4π, where eD is
the gauge coupling associated with the dark pho-
ton.

• The stability of the dark pion is ensured as a result
of an accidental symmetry of the model. This ac-
cidental symmetry is an extremely good symmetry
unless the cutoﬀ scale of the theory is very low.

We ﬁnd that the model is phenomenologically viable

and has interesting implications. In particular,

• There is a signiﬁcant parameter region in which the
dark pion comprises the dark matter of the uni-
verse. In this region, the dark pion mass is compa-
rable but smaller than the dark photon mass, which
is of order 10 MeV – 1 GeV. The mixing parameter
between the dark and standard model photons is in
the range ≈ 10−4.5 – 10−2.5.

• In a corner of the allowed parameter region, the dis-
crepancy of the muon g−2 between the experimen-
tal result and standard model prediction [9, 10] is
ameliorated due to a loop contribution of the dark
photon. Clearly, the model may also ameliorate the
muon g − 2 discrepancy even if the dark pion does
not comprise all of the dark matter.

• The model predicts a plethora of new resonances
around 10 MeV – 10 GeV, some of which may

be detectable in future experiments.
In particu-
lar, one of the lowest-lying spin-one CP -odd states,
the dark rho meson ρD3, mixes with the dark
photon and hence couples to the standard model
fermions. This provides a monochromatic photon
signal in rare decays of standard model particles,
e.g. Υ → γρD3, which can be probed by the Belle II
experiment.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec-
tion II, we present our model and analyze its dynamics.
In Section III, we study physics of the dark pion as dark
matter. We present a parameter region in which the dark
pion is dark matter while avoiding constraints from ex-
isting experiments and observations. In Section IV, we
discuss the muon g − 2. Finally, in Section V, we discuss
the possibility of detecting the dark rho meson.

II. THE MODEL

The model has a gauge group GD = SU (N ), whose
dynamical scale (the mass scale of generic low-lying res-
onances) is Λ ≈ O(10 MeV – 1 GeV), and two ﬂavors of
dark quarks transforming under it. In addition, we in-
troduce an Abelian U (1)D gauge group under which the
dark quarks are charged as in Table I while the standard
model particles are singlet. We may take 0 ≤ a ≤ 1
without loss of generality.
We assume a (cid:54)= 1. This makes the theory chiral,
i.e. the mass terms of the dark quarks are forbidden by
the U (1)D gauge symmetry, so that the only free pa-
rameters in this sector are the dynamical scale of GD,
Λ, and the gauge coupling of U (1)D, eD.
(There are
also θ parameters for GD and U (1)D, but they can be
eliminated by phase rotations of dark quarks.) The
SU (2)L × SU (2)R × U (1)B ﬂavor symmetry of GD is
explicitly broken by U (1)D gauge interactions. For a = 0
it is broken to U (1)D × SU (2)R × U (1)B, while for a (cid:54)= 0
the residual symmetry is U (1)D × U (1)B × U (1)P . (The
U (1)B symmetry is anomalous with respect to U (1)D,
but this does not have any consequence for our discus-
sion.) The charges of the dark quarks under U (1)B and
U (1)P are given in Table I.

Let us ﬁrst discuss the strong dynamics of the dark
gauge group GD. Below the dynamical scale Λ, the dark

bination of a vector current and the baryon number current. Here
we need to include an axial current as well. A possible eﬀect from

the nonzero dark photon mass is suppressed by(cid:0)mAD /mρD

(cid:1)2.

From now on, we only consider a (cid:54)= 0.

We next discuss couplings between the dark and stan-
dard model sectors. These couplings are induced by
a kinetic mixing between the hypercharge, U (1)Y , and
U (1)D gauge bosons, deﬁned by

where Bµν and ADµν are the U (1)Y and U (1)D gauge

In the
limit  → 0, the Z boson and the photon couple to the
standard model particles as usual, and the dark photon
couples to φ through interactions in Eq. (4):

L = (Dµφ)(Dµφ)†,

(9)

where

Dµφ = ∂µφ + ieD(1 + a)ADµφ.

(10)
For  (cid:54)= 0, after solving the kinetic and mass mixings, we
ﬁnd that the dark photon also couples to standard model
particles as [12]

L = −eADµJ µ

(11)

where e and J µ
em are the electromagnetic coupling and
current, respectively. Here, we have assumed mAD (cid:28)
mZ and  (cid:28) 1, and neglected interactions suppressed by
mAD /mZ or higher powers of . The standard model Z
boson also couples to the U (1)D charged particles as

L = eD tan θW ZµJ µ
D,

(12)

where J µ

D is the U (1)D current.

III. DARK PION AS DARK MATTER

As we have seen, the model has two accidental sym-
metries U (1)B and U (1)P . These symmetries guarantee
the stability of dark baryons and the dark pion φ, re-
spectively. In the early universe, dark baryons eﬀectively
annihilate into dark pions, so that their thermal abun-
dance is negligible. We are therefore left with the dark
pion as our dark matter candidate.

The U (1)P symmetry, in fact, is an extremely good
symmetry. The GD and U (1)D gauge symmetries forbid
interactions that explicitly break the U (1)P symmetry
up to dimension eight. Therefore, unless the scale sup-
pressing higher dimension operators is very low, the dark
pion is stable at cosmological timescales.

The phenomenology of the dark particles depends sig-
niﬁcantly on the ratio of the masses of the dark pion, mφ,
and dark photon, mAD . Below we discuss three cases
mφ < mAD /2, mAD /2 < mφ < mAD , and mφ > mAD in
turn.

3

1. mφ < mAD /2

The case mφ < mAD /2 occurs if the U (1)D charge a is
suﬃciently small or if N is suﬃciently large. The thermal
abundance of dark pions in this case is determined by
the annihilation into standard model particles through
s-channel dark photon exchange. The annihilation cross
section into a pair of standard model fermions f with the
electric charge qf and mass mf is given by

(13)

where v is the relative velocity between the initial two
dark pions. We ﬁnd that the annihilation cross section
is suppressed by the relative velocity. This is because
the intermediate dark photon has an odd C parity and
hence the initial state dark pions must be in p-wave. This
implies that the velocity suppression exists regardless of
the ﬁnal state as long as the annihilation is through the
s-channel dark photon exchange.3

In Fig. 1, we show the constraints on (mAD , ) for
mφ = 0.4mAD and a = 1/2. Here, we determine the
U (1)D gauge coupling, eD, so that the thermal relic of
dark pions explains the observed dark matter abundance.
The blue shaded region in the upper part is excluded by
the search for the process Υ → γ + AD at the BaBar
experiment [13, 14]. The brown shaded region is ex-
cluded by the K + → π+ν ¯ν searches at E787 [15] and
E949 [16], which constrain the K + → π+AD process [14].
The purple shaded region in the upper-left part is elim-
inated because of too large contributions to the electron
g − 2 [17, 18]. The gray shaded region in the left is
excluded by the search for the process π0 → γAD fol-
lowed by AD → φ ¯φ with subsequent scatterings of φ in
the LSND detector [19, 20].
In the yellow shaded re-
gion, dark pions annihilate after neutrinos decouple from
the thermal bath in the early universe, so that the neu-
trino energy density becomes too small [7]. The green
shaded region is excluded by the search for the process
e−N → e−N AD followed by AD → φ ¯φ with subsequent
scatterings of φ in the E137 detector [21, 22].

In the region below the gray dashed line, which runs
diagonally from the lower left to the upper right, the
dark photon coupling is large (eD > 1 around the dark
pion mass scale), so that eD hits the Landau pole below
typical uniﬁcation scales of 1014 – 1017 GeV. If we want
to avoid this, we are left with the region centered around
mAD ≈ O(100 MeV – 1 GeV) and  ≈ O(10−3.5 – 10−2.5).

3 Diagrams with two intermediate dark photons lead to s-wave
annihilation. Such processes are suppressed by  and a loop or
extra two-body phase space factor, and hence negligible.

section at the maximum temperature at which the BBN
could be aﬀected by the annihilations. This treatment
most likely gives a too aggressive bound. For proton-
neutron conversion, we assumed the maximum tempera-
ture of 1 MeV, where the proton-neutron ratio is ﬁxed in
the standard BBN. A precise estimate of the constraint
from the BBN requires a dedicated calculation, which is
beyond the scope of this paper.

In addition to the bounds discussed above, the anni-
hilation cross section of dark pions is also constrained
by the hadro- and photo-dissociation processes dur-
ing the BBN, eﬀect on ﬂuctuations of the cosmic mi-
crowave background, and production of gamma rays in
the present universe. Because of the p-wave suppression
of the annihilation, these constraints are weak and do not
exclude the parameter region further.

Since the dark pion mass is much smaller than the
nucleon mass, it is diﬃcult to directly detect dark pi-
ons through collisions with nuclei. However, scattering
of dark pions with electrons may be detectable [26]. In
Fig. 1, we show the contours of the scattering cross sec-
tion between the dark pion and the electron, given by

in the nonrelativistic and mφ (cid:29) me limit. We ﬁnd that
the model gives

(15)

A projected experiment with semiconductor targets can
probe the cross section down to σφe ∼ 10−42 cm2 [26].

2. mAD /2 < mφ < mAD

FIG. 1. Constraints on the dark photon mass, mAD , and the
mixing parameter  for mφ = 0.4mAD and a = 1/2. The
U (1)D gauge coupling, eD, is determined so that the thermal
abundance of dark pions reproduces the observed dark matter
abundance. The blue, brown, purple, gray, yellow, and green
shaded regions are excluded by the mono-photon search at the
BaBar experiment, K + → π+ν ¯ν searches at E787 and E949,
the electron g − 2, the search for π0 → γAD → γφ ¯φ with
subsequent scatterings of φ in the LSND detector, dark pions
annihilating after the neutrino decoupling, and the search for
e−N → e−N AD → e−N φ ¯φ with subsequent scatterings of φ
in the E137 detector, respectively.
In the region below the
gray dashed line, eD > 1 around the dark pion mass scale,
so that eD hits a Landau pole below the uniﬁcation scale.
Between the two vertical green dashed lines, the annihilation
of dark pions during the BBN may result in too much 4He.
The calculation of this bound, however, is subject to large
theoretical uncertainties; see the text.

We note that the region between the two vertical green
dashed lines may be excluded by the big bang nucleosyn-
thesis (BBN) because annihilations of dark pions into
hadrons in the BBN era may lead to proton-nucleon con-
version that yields too many 4He [23, 24]. However, this
bound, derived naively by extrapolating the bound in
Ref. [24], might be too strong.
In Ref. [24], the dark
matter mass was taken to be larger than 10 GeV, and
the annihilation was assumed to be s-wave. To convert
this to our bound, we ﬁrst assumed that the upper bound
on the dark matter annihilation cross section scales as
σv ∼ m3/2
φ comes from the square
−1/2
of the number density of φ, and m
from the multi-

plicity of particles produced by the annihilations.4 We
then adopted the upper bound on the annihilation cross

4 Strictly speaking, the latter scaling is valid only down to mφ (cid:39)
1 GeV, but we also use it below 1 GeV, since the resulting error
is expected to be insigniﬁcant in the region of interest.

If mAD /2 < mφ < mAD , the dark photon does not
decay into dark pions. It decays only into standard model
fermions. For the annihilation of dark pions, the three-

For larger mφ, the three body annihilation mode is
more eﬀective because of larger phase space of the ﬁnal
state. As a result, the Planck data becomes more con-
straining, excluding the model up to larger values of . In
particular, for mφ (cid:38) 0.8mAD no viable parameter region
remains.

3. mφ > mAD

For mφ > mAD , the thermal abundance of dark pions
is determined by the s-wave annihilation mode of φ ¯φ →
ADAD. Since the same annihilation mode is eﬀective
in the eras of the BBN and recombination, this mass
spectrum is excluded by the constraints from the BBN
and the cosmic microwave background.

In the absence of this contribution, there is a discrepancy
of the muon g − 2 between the experimental result and
standard model prediction, aexp − aSM = (26.1 ± 8.0) ×
10−10 [9, 10].
In Figs. 1 and 2, we depict the region
of (mAD , ) in which the experimental and theoretical
values become consistent at the 1σ (2σ) level because of
this contribution by the red (pink) shaded bands. We
ﬁnd that the regions in which the discrepancy can be
ameliorated are excluded by other experiments.

This conclusion, however, does depend on the ratio
between the dark pion and dark photon masses. In par-
ticular, if mφ is slightly smaller than mAD /2, we ﬁnd
a small parameter region in which the muon g − 2 dis-
crepancy can be ameliorated. This is because the value
of eD required to obtain the correct thermal relic abun-
dance becomes smaller for a ﬁxed (mAD , ), so that the
scattering rates of φ with the detectors become smaller,
weakening constraints. In Fig. 3 we show the same plot
as Fig. 1 except that we take mφ = 0.45mAD , instead of
0.4mAD . We see a small region in which the experimental
and theoretical values of the muon g − 2 become consis-
tent within 2σ. The weakening of the constraints also
enlarges the parameter space for dark pion dark matter.
In particular, there is now a sliver of the allowed region
along the eD ∼ 1 line, which goes down to smaller dark
photon masses.
We may consider the model to ameliorate the muon
g − 2 discrepancy without requiring that the dark pion
comprises all of the dark matter.
In Fig. 4, we show
the constraints on (mAD , eD) for mφ = 0.45mAD and
a = 1/2, with the value of  determined so that the
discrepancy of the muon g − 2 between the experimen-
tal and standard model values is ameliorated by the

FIG. 2. Constraints on the dark photon mass, mAD , and
the mixing parameter  for mφ = 0.6mAD and a = 1/2.
The gray shaded region at the bottom is excluded by the
constraint from the Planck experiment on the annihilation
D → ADe+e−. The blue, green, and brown
mode φ ¯φ → ADA∗
shaded regions are excluded by the search for the process Υ →
γAD → γ(cid:96)+(cid:96)− ((cid:96) = e, µ), the process π0 → γAD → γe+e−,
and the process e−N → e−N AD → e−N e−e+, respectively.
The meanings of the other shaded regions and lines are the
same as those in Fig. 1.

and we have neglected the mass of the standard model
fermion f . Being the three-body channel, the process
is subdominant in determining the thermal abundance
of dark pions. It can, however, give dominant eﬀects in
later stages of the evolution of the universe, since it is
s-wave. In particular, it is eﬀective around the recom-
bination era and aﬀects the ﬂuctuations of the cosmic
microwave background.

Fig. 2 shows the constraints on (mAD , ) for mφ =
0.6mAD and a = 1/2. The gray shaded region at the
bottom is excluded by the constraint on the annihilation
D → ADe+e− from the measurement
mode φ ¯φ → ADA∗
of the cosmic microwave background by the Planck ex-
periment [6]. The blue, green, and brown shaded regions
are excluded by the search for the process Υ → γAD
followed by AD → e+e−, µ+µ− at the BaBar experi-
ment [27], the search for the process π0 → γAD followed
by AD → e+e− at the NA48/2 [28], and the search for
the process e−N → e−N AD followed by AD → e−e+ in
beam dump experiments [29], respectively. The mean-
ings of the other shaded regions and lines are the same
as those in Fig. 1. This leaves us the region around
mAD ≈ O(10 MeV – 100 MeV) and  ≈ O(10−4.5 – 10−3)
as the bulk of the viable parameter space. The scattering
cross section between the dark pion and the electron in
this region is

ings of the other shaded regions are the same as those in
Fig. 1. We ﬁnd that the discrepancy of the muon g−2 can
be ameliorated in the region around mAD (cid:39) 150 MeV,
consistently with all the other experiments. In the ﬁg-
ure, we also show the contours of the eﬀective scattering
cross section between the dark pion and the electron,
σe,eﬀ = σφe × (Ωφ,th/ΩDM).

V. DARK RHO MESONS

The model predicts a plethora of resonance states com-
posed of the dark quarks and GD gauge bosons. The
masses of these states depend on parameters of the model
but are generally in the range of 10 MeV – 10 GeV. These
states may be detectable in various experiments. Here we
discuss a possible way to detect the lowest-lying spin-one
CP -odd composite states: the dark rho mesons ρD.

The masses of ρD are expected to be larger than the
mass of the dark photon by about an order of magnitude

One of the dark rho mesons, which we call ρD3, has
the same charge as π3 under the vectorial subgroup of
SU (2)L × SU (2)R and mixes with the dark photon. The
mixing induces the coupling of ρD3 with the standard
model fermions

This coupling leads to rare decays of standard model par-
ticles such as Υ → γρD3, which yield monochromatic
photons. Adopting the analysis for the dark photon
in Ref. [14], we ﬁnd that the Belle II experiment will
be sensitive to the dark rho meson with (cid:48) (cid:38) 10−4 for
< 10 GeV.5 Observation of the two rare
1 GeV < mρD3
decay modes Υ → γAD and γρD3 in future experiments
would provide strong evidence for the model.

The value of the mixing parameter  is determined so that
∆aµ,AD = (26.1−16.0)×10−10. In the red shaded region, the
thermal relic abundance of dark pions exceeds the observed
dark matter abundance. The meanings of the other shaded
regions are the same as those in Fig. 1. The dotted lines are
the contours of the eﬀective scattering cross section between
the dark pion and the electron.

dark photon contribution to the 2σ level, ∆aµ,AD =
(26.1 − 16.0) × 10−10. In the red shaded region at the
bottom, the thermal relic abundance of dark pions ex-
ceeds the observed dark matter abundance. The mean-

5 In Ref. [14] the width of the dark photon is assumed to be negli-
gible, while our ρD3 has a decay width of ∼ mρD /N . For small

N , this width is not negligible, so that the sensitivity to (cid:48) would
be somewhat weaker.
