Using a highly viscous magnetic ﬂuid, the dynamics in the aftermath of the Rosensweig instability
can be slowed down by more than 2000 times. In this way we expand the regime where the growth
rate is predicted to scale linearly with the bifurcation parameter by six orders of magnitude, while
this regime is tiny for standard ferroﬂuids and can not be resolved experimentally there. We measure
the growth of the pattern by means of a two-dimensional imaging technique, and ﬁnd that the
slopes of the growth and decay rates are not the same - a qualitative discrepancy to the theoretical
predictions. We solve this discrepancy by taking into account a viscosity which is assumed to be
diﬀerent for the growth and decay. This may be a consequence of the measured shear thinning of
the ferroﬂuid.

INTRODUCTION

so far not resolved phenomena.

The ”pitch-drop-experiment” [1], which received the
Ig-Nobel Price in physics 2005, has brought to the at-
tention that a fast process like drop formation [2, 3] can
be retarded considerably if instead of a standard liquid
like water – it has a viscosity of 10−3 Pa s at 20 ◦C –
a material like pitch, with a viscosity around 108 Pa s
is selected. The funnel was ﬁlled in 1930 [4], and to-
day ”Finally the ninth Pitch Drop has fallen from the
world’s longest running lab experiment” [5] and the 10th
is awaited within the next 14 years. Here the question
arises whether those high viscosities may give access to

In the following we are investigating this question for
the case of the well known Rosensweig or normal ﬁeld
instability [8]. It is observed in a horizontal layer of mag-
netic ﬂuid (MF) [9] with a free surface, when a critical
value Bc of the vertically oriented magnetic induction is
surpassed. Figure 1 presents a photo of the ﬁnal hexago-
nal arrangement of static liquid peaks. Beside the thresh-
old, beyond which the instability occurs, two quantities
characterizing the emerging pattern have been in the fo-
cus of various studies: the critical wave number of the
peaks and the corresponding growth rate, where both
are strongly inﬂuenced by the viscosity of the magnetic
ﬂuid.

That essential role of the viscosity for the dynamics
of the pattern formation is reﬂected in the course of the
analyses devoted to the Rosensweig instability. For an
inviscid magnetic ﬂuid (the dynamic viscosity η is zero)
and an inﬁnitely deep container, Cowley and Rosensweig
[8] provide a linear stability analysis already in the very
ﬁrst description of the normal ﬁeld instability to ﬁnd the
critical threshold Bc and the critical wave number kc.
This approach has been extended later by Salin [10] to
ﬂuids with non-zero viscosity, where the growth rate de-
pends on η, and to a ﬁnite depth of the container by
Weilepp and Brand [11]. First experimental investiga-
tions on the growth of the pattern are provided by Lange
et al. [12, 13], who also derive the growth rate for the case
of a viscous magnetic ﬂuid and an arbitrary layer thick-
ness h. This theoretical analysis has been later extended
to the case of a nonlinear magnetization curve M (H) by
Knieling et al. [14].

Whereas so far the growth rate of the emerging
Rosensweig pattern has been measured utilizing ferroﬂu-

ids with η = 4.2 × 10−3 Pa s [12, 14] and 5.2 × 10−2 Pa s

[14] we are tackling here the growth process in a ferroﬂuid
which is a thousand times more viscous than the ﬁrst one.
Such a ferroﬂuid is being created by cooling a commer-
cially available viscous ferroﬂuid (APG E32 from Fer-

rotec Co. ) down to 10 ◦C. The ferroﬂuid has now a vis-
cosity of (4.48 ± 0.1) Pa s. In such a cooled Rosensweig
(sloppy Frozensweig) instability [15] the growth of the
pattern takes 60 seconds and can be measured with high
temporal resolution in the extended system using a two-
dimensional X-ray imaging technique [16, 17]. That tech-
nique provides the full surface topography, as opposed to
the 7 kHz fast, but one dimensional Hall-sensor array,
which had to be utilized for the low viscosity ferroﬂu-
ids [14]. The potential of the retarded instability was
demonstrated before [18], when the coeﬃcients of non-
linear amplitude equations were determined in this way.
In addition a sequence of localized patches of Rosensweig
pattern could be uncovered most recently [19] with that
technique.

Here we exploit a higher viscosity to investigate the
linear growth rate in a regime, which was hitherto not ac-
cessible. This expectation is based on a scaling analysis
presented in Ref. [20]. For supercritical inductions larger
than ¯ν2/6 (the dimensionless kinematic viscosity ¯ν is de-
ﬁned in Eq. (3.6c) below) the behavior of the growth rate
is characterized by a square-root dependence on those
inductions, as conﬁrmed in [14]. Contrary, for super-
critical inductions smaller than ¯ν2/6 the behavior of the
growth rate is characterized by a linear dependence. In
the present experiment we increase ¯ν2/6 by six orders
of magnitude due to the high viscosity of the ferroﬂuid
APG E32 at 10 ◦C. Thus a new territory of linear scaling
is open for exploration.

The outline of the paper is as follows: the experimental
setup and the measurements are sketched in the next
Sect. II. The theoretical analysis is presented in Sect.
III and compared with the experimental ﬁndings in the
subsequent Sect. IV.

II. EXPERIMENT

In this section we describe the experimental setup
(Sect. II A), the ferroﬂuid (Sect. II B), the protocol uti-
lized for the measurements (Sect. II C), and the way the
linear growth rate is extracted from the recorded data
(Sect. II D).

A. Experimental setup

The experimental setup for the measurements of the
surface topography consists of an tailor made X-ray appa-
ratus described in detail before [16, 17]. An X-ray point
source emits radiation vertically from above through the
container ﬁlled with the MF. Underneath the container,
an X-ray camera records the radiation passing through
the layer of MF. The intensity at each pixel of the de-
tector is directly related to the height of the ﬂuid above
that pixel, as sketched in Fig. 2(a). Therefore, the full
surface topography can be reconstructed after calibration
[16, 17].

The container, which holds the MF sample, is depicted
in Fig. 2(b). It is a regular octagon machined from alu-
minium with a side length of 77 mm and two concentric
inner bores with a diameter of 140 mm. These circular
holes are carved from above and below, leaving only a
thin base in the middle of the vessel with a thickness of
2 mm. On top of the octagon, a circular aluminium lid
is placed, which closes the hole from above, as shown in
Fig. 2(b). Each side of the octagon is equipped with a
thermoelectric element QC-127-1.4-8.5MS from Quick-
Ohm, as shown in Fig. 2(c). The latter are powered by
a 1.2 kW Kepco KLP-20-120 power supply. The hot side
of the Peltier elements is connected to water cooled heat
exchangers. The temperature is measured at the bottom
of the aluminium container with a Pt100 resistor. The
temperature diﬀerence between the center and the edge
of the bottom plate does not exceed 0.1 K at the tem-
perature θ = 10.0 ◦C measured at the edge of the ves-
sel. A closed loop control, realized using a computer and
programmable interface devices, holds θ constant within
10 mK.

The container is surrounded by a Helmholtz-pair-of-
coils, thermally isolated from the vessel with a ring made
from the ﬂame resistant material FR-2. The size of the
coils is adapted to the size of the vessel in order to intro-
duce a ”magnetic ramp” at the edge of the vessel. This
technique, as described more detailed in Ref. [21], serves
to minimize distortions by compensating partly the jump
of the magnetization at the container edge. Filling the
container to a height of 5 mm with ferroﬂuid enhances
the magnetic induction in comparison with the empty
coils for the same current I. Therefore B(I) is measured
immediately beneath the bottom of the container, at the
central position, and serves as the control parameter in
the following.

B. Characterization of the ferroﬂuid

The vessel is ﬁlled with the commercial magnetic ﬂuid
APG E32 from Ferrotec Co. up to a hight of 5 mm. The
material parameters of this MF are listed in Tab. I. The
density was measured using a DMA 4100 density meter
from Anton Paar. The surface tension was measured us-
ing a commercial ring tensiometer (Lauda TE 1) and a
pendant drop method (Dataphysics OCA 20). Both meth-

but when the liquid is allowed to rest for one day, σ drops

ods result in a surface tension of σ = (31± 0.5) mN m−1,
down to (25± 0.5) mN m−1. This eﬀect, which is not ob-

served in similar, but less viscous magnetic liquids like
the one used in Ref. [22], gives a hint that the surfac-
tants change the surface tension at least on a longer time
scale, when the surface is changed. Since indeed the pat-
tern formation experiments do change the surface during
the measurements, the uncertainty of the surface tension

is ≈ 5 mN m−1, as given in Tab. I.

with η0 = 0.48 mPa s, ψ = 1074 K, and θ0 = −107.5 ◦C,
as described in detail in Ref. [18]. For the present mea-
surements, we chose a temperature of θ = 10 ◦C, where
the viscosity amounts to η = 4.48 Pa s according to Eq.
(2.2).

roﬂuidic spikes takes place in a magnetic ﬁeld, which is
known to alter the viscosity. Furnishing the rheometer
with the magnetorheological device MRD 170-1T from
Anton Paar we exemplary measure the magnetoviscous
behaviour for a shear rate of ˙γ = 1 s−1. We use a plate-
plate conﬁguration with a gap of 300 µm, where the up-
per plate has a diameter of 20 mm. Figure 4 displays the
measured data together with a ﬁt by

the ratio between the magnetic energy of the dipole in

η|α=0 captures the viscosity without a magnetic ﬁeld,
ηr the additional rotational viscosity due to the pres-
ence of the magnetic ﬁeld (cid:126)Hi in the ferroﬂuid, and Φh
is the hydrodynamic volume fraction of the magnetite
particles. The brackets (cid:104). . .(cid:105) indicate a spatial average
over the inclosed quantity. Note that in case of Fig. 4
the angle β between (cid:126)Hi and the vorticity of the ﬂow is
90o. For the ﬁt the internal ﬁeld was obtained via solving
Hi = B/µ0−D · M (Hi), assuming a demagnetization fac-
tor of D = 1. The ﬁt yields a hydrodynamic volume frac-
tion of Φh = 43.5± 0.1% and α/Hi = 256± 2· 10−6 m/A.

to this model.

samples of high viscosity at a temperature of θ = 20 ◦C.
Figure 3 shows the data, which have been ﬁtted by the
modiﬁed mean ﬁeld model of second order [23], marked
by the dashed black line. For a comparison with the pat-
tern formation experiments performed at θ = 10 ◦C, this
curve is extrapolated utilizing this model (blue line). The
deviation between both curves is tiny, which was corrobo-
rated with a vibrating sample magnetometer (Lakeshore
VSM 7404) at θ = 20 ◦C and 10 ◦C. Note that the VSM
oﬀers the advantage that it can be tempered, but has a
lower resolution in comparison to the ﬂuxmetric device
because of the smaller sample volume.

To take into account the nonlinear M (H), an eﬀective

susceptibility ¯χH is deﬁned by a geometric mean

1 + ¯χH =(cid:112)(1 + χta)(1 + χch),

(2.1)

with the tangent susceptibility χta = ∂M/∂H and the
chord susceptibility χch = M/H [26]. For any ﬁeld H
the eﬀective susceptibility ¯χH can be evaluated, when
the magnetization M (H) curve is known.

b. Viscosity The viscosity η deserves special atten-
tion for the experiments, as it inﬂuences the time scale of
the pattern formation. It has been measured in a temper-

ature range of −5 ◦C ≤ θ ≤ 20 ◦C, using a commercial

rheometer (MCR 301, Anton Paar) with a shear cell fea-
turing a cone-plate geometry. At room temperature, the
magnetic ﬂuid with a viscosity of η = 2 Pa s is 2000 times
more viscous than water. The value of η can be increased

by factor of 9 when the liquid is cooled to −5 ◦C. The

temperature dependent viscosity data can be nicely ﬁtted
with the well-known Vogel-Fulcher law [27]

From V one estimates a mean diameter of dm = 15 nm
for the magnetic particles. This is almost a factor of ten
larger than d0 = 1.7 nm obtained from the magnetisation
curve (cf. table I). Assuming a spherical layer of oleic acid
molecules of thickness δ = 2 nm around the magnetic
particles [9], the volume fraction of the magnetic active

material is Φ = Φh · (1+2δ/dm)−3 = 21.4%. This is more

than three times larger than the value obtained via the
magnetisation curve (cf. table I). The elevated values of d
and Φ may be a consequence of magnetic agglomerates,
which are not taken into account by Eq. (2.3).

at at the tenfold value of B = 114 mT. At the same time
η0 does not even double. This quantitative description is
in agreement with the increasing decay of the curves in
Fig. 5. The deepening of shear thinning with B has been
attributed to the formation of chains and agglomerates
of magnetic particles in the ﬁeld, and their subsequent
destruction under shear. Chains have been uncovered by
transmission electron microscopy [30, 31], and their de-
sctruction has been studied in magnetorheology [32]. For
a review see, e.g., Ref. [33].

To conclude this paragraph, both, the ﬁt of the magne-
toviscous behaviour as well as the shear thinning are indi-
cating that agglomerates of magnetic particles are emerg-
ing in the ﬁeld. In this way the faint non-Newtonian be-
haviour of the suspension which is already present at zero
induction may be enhanced considerably in the ﬁeld and
may cause unexpected dynamics.

C. Measurement protocol

To test the ﬂow behaviour of the ferroﬂuid, the vis-
cosity was measured versus the shear rate for three ex-
emplary magnetic inductions, as presented in Fig. 5. All
curves exhibit a decay of the viscosity for increasing ˙γ,
i.e. shear thinning which is typical for dispersions [28].
For a quantitative description of this eﬀect the measured
data are ﬁtted by the Sisko equation [29]

η( ˙γ) = k ˙γn−1 + η0.

(2.4)

adapted to the limit ˙γ → 0 s−1, where η → η0. More-

over k denotes a factor and n a scaling exponent. Table
II displays the ﬁtting parameters obtained for the three
inductions. Under increase of B most prominently the
factor k is varying. For B = 0 mT k is tiny and we have
an almost Newtonian liquid. The factor k doubles at
B = 11.4 mT, and eventually enlarges by a factor of ten

Figure 6 displays the measurement protocol on the ba-
sis of the bifurcation diagram, measured in Ref. [18]. The
static pattern amplitude of the Rosensweig instability in
our ﬂuid is indicated by the red line. When the system is
set onto an arbitrary initial point (Bini, Aini) in this dia-
gram, and the magnetic induction B is kept constant, the
amplitude A increases or decreases monotonically, until
the system reaches the stable equilibrium (solid red line).
The direction of the change of A depends on the region,
where (Bini, Aini) is situated – in the regions I and III in
Fig. 6, A increases, and in regions II and IV, the ampli-
tude decreases with time.

In order to push the system to an arbitrary initial lo-
cation (Bini, Aini), a three-step measurement protocol is
employed. The ﬁrst step (path ↑1 ) is always a relax-
ation of the pattern in region I at the overcritical in-

plays a reconstruction of the surface in real space. The outer
dimension of the container is not to scale. The color code

The pattern amplitude is determined from the correspond-
ing power spectrum shown in (b) by the total power in the
encircled mode. The data are taken from Ref. [18].

duction B1 = 11.45 mT for τ1 = 60 s, to reach the high
amplitude of Ahigh = 2.98 mm at that point. The corre-
sponding pattern is shown in Fig. 7. Then the magnetic
induction is quickly reduced to the value B2 = 10.74mT,
and the resulting dynamics is observed (path ↓2 ), until
the desired starting amplitude (Aini,II, Aini,IV, or Aini,I)
is reached after a period τ2. To start with this pattern at
arbitrary inductions in the regimes II, IV, I the induction
is then quickly raised to the desired value Bini. Then we
record the pattern evolution along the path ↑3a or ↓3b
in region II, IV, and I, respectively.
We use this detour instead of directly switching the
magnetic induction from zero to Bini in order to estab-
lish the identical pattern in all regions. Coming from a
perfectly ﬂat surface, the pattern would have additional
degrees of freedom, e.g. it could amplify any local dis-
turbance, resulting in a propagating wave front on the
liquid surface [21, 35]. The emerging hexagonal pattern
would comprise point defects or diﬀerent orientations of
the wave vectors [35, 36]. When we take the detour by
the paths ↑1 and ↓2, we seed a regular hexagonal pattern
at (B1, Ahigh), and the evolving pattern is likely to be of
the same regularity.

D. Extraction of the growth rate

Next we describe the extraction of the growth rate from
the recorded sequence of X-ray frames along the path
↑3a or ↓3b. From each X-ray frame the surface topog-
raphy is reconstructed following the procedure described
in Ref. [17]. As an example, Fig. 7(a) displays the result-
ing surface topography at (B1, Ahigh). The amplitude of
the pattern is determined in Fourier space, as sketched
in Fig. 7(b). We use a circularly symmetric Hamming
window with a radius of 46 mm [18]. The total power in
one of the modes, as marked in Fig. 7(b) by a red circle,
is used to compute the amplitude of the pattern [18].

Figure 8 shows three exemplary curves for the growth
of the pattern amplitude A. With increasing induction

B3 (from (cid:5) via (cid:74) to (cid:3)) the growth increases; likewise

FIG. 8. (Color online) Three examples for the growth of the
pattern amplitude in region I. The initial state was prepared
with the sequence B2 = 10.743 mT, τ2 = 20.000 s. The three
curves have been measured after switching to B3 = 11.455 mT

((cid:3)), 11.376 mT ((cid:74)), and 11.323 mT ((cid:5)), respectively. The

solid black lines denote ﬁts by Eq. (2.5).

FIG. 9. (Color online) Three examples for the decay of the
pattern amplitude. The initial state was prepared with the
sequence B2 = 10.743 mT, τ2 = 10.000 s. The three curves
have been measured after switching to B3 = 10.888 mT ((cid:3)),

11.020 mT ((cid:74)), and 11.059 mT ((cid:5)), respectively. The solid

black lines denote ﬁts by Eq. (2.5).

Fig. 9 presents three examples for the decay of A, where
B3 denotes the initial induction Bini after the three steps
of the detour procedure. Remarkably A does not relax
to zero, but to a small oﬀset of Aconst which linearly
increases from 32 µm at 10.7 mT to 34 µm at 10.9 mT.

A possible explanation are imperfections induced by
the lateral container wall, as already observed before, see
e.g. Refs. [17, 37]. In the present setup special precau-
tions were taken by means of a ”magnetic ramp” [21]
to minimize such ﬁnite size eﬀects. However for an ex-
perimental setup with ﬁnite aspect ratio they can not be
excluded. The fact that Aconst does increase only slightly
with B does not contradict this assumption, because the
decay is investigated in the regime II well below Bc. From
Fig. 6 one clearly unveils that an increase of the imper-
fection becomes only prominent in the hysteretic regime
(IV).

A further explanation would be an inhomogeneous dis-

strict the ﬁt to the interval A ∈ [0.0 mm, 0.3 mm], for
which we assume that a linear description is still possi-
ble. This is corroborated by exemplary ﬁts in Figs. 8 and
9 which are marked by solid black lines.

In Fig. 10 we present the extracted growth and decay
rate ω2 versus the applied induction B = B3. Because
of the large statistical errors of ω2 we have refrained to
plot the decay rate in the hysteretic regime. The mea-
sured values show a monotonous relation with the applied
induction, and indicate that a critical value for the mag-
netic induction of about 11.2 mT exists. Using the mate-
rial parameters from table I and an inﬁnite layer thickness
yields Bc,theo,lin,∞ = 10.5 mT [8].

III. THEORY

The experimental system, described in Sect. II, is mod-
eled as a horizontally unbounded layer of an incom-
pressible, nonconducting, and viscous magnetic ﬂuid sub-
jected to a magnetic ﬁeld which is perpendicular to the
plain, horizontal, and undisturbed surface. The ﬂuid is
bounded from below by the bottom of a container made
of a magnetically insusceptible material and has a free
surface with air above.

According to the linear stability analysis [39], the pat-
tern amplitude A can be described by an exponential
growth, A ∼ exp (−i˜ωt), with an exponent ˜ω = ω1 + iω2,
when A is small. The real part of −i˜ω, ω2, is called the
growth rate and deﬁnes whether the disturbances will
grow (ω2 > 0) or decay (ω2 < 0). The absolute value
of the imaginary part of −i˜ω, |ω1|, gives the angular fre-
quency of the oscillations if it is diﬀerent form zero [39].
The exponent ˜ω follows from the dispersion relation
given in Ref. [14] for a layer of MF with the ﬁnite depth
h, a nonlinear magnetization curve M (H), the surface
tension σ, the density ρ, and the kinematic viscosity ν

tribution of surfactants at the surface of the MF, which
develops after the massive destruction of surface area,
which can not be followed up by the diﬀusion of the sur-
factants on the surface and into the bulk liquid. A re-
sulting spatial variation of σ would lead to surface crests,
somehow reminiscent of those observed in Marangoni
convection.

A third explanation is an inhomogeneous distribution
of magnetic particles due to magnetophoresis [38] taken
place while the ﬁeld is at B1. We consider this less likely
because of the enormous time scales of such a process at
the large viscosity of the experimental ﬂuid.

growth or decay rate by a least square ﬁt with the func-

clusions can be drawn: for k = kc, ˜ω is purely imaginary
and the pattern grows or decays exponentially.

Inspecting Eq. (3.7) one sees that Γ is independent of the
wave number ¯k and it is a ﬁnite constant. Exploiting the
latter and using that at the point of bifurcation ¯ω2( ¯M =

For ﬁnding a scaling law for the growth rate, we dif-
ferentiate implicitly the dimensionless dispersion rela-
tion (3.5) with respect to ¯M , i.e. we determine the slope
of the growth rate called Γ. By taking the limit ¯M = 1
we ﬁnd Γ in the vicinity of the point of bifurcation,

Γ =

(3.7)

That linear dependence of ¯ω2 on ˆM is universal and is
depicted already in the measured growth rates presented
in Fig. 10. Since Γ scales with 1/¯ν, the slope of the
growth rates goes to inﬁnity in the limit of inviscid ﬂuids.
Moreover, for normal magnetic ﬂuids with their rather
low viscosity the range of validity of Eq. (3.8) is bounded
by ¯ν2/6 which is very small, see third row, third line
in Tab. III. Therefore this scaling law is only of limited
practical value.

For low viscous ﬂuids it holds that ω2/(cid:0)νk2(cid:1) =
¯ω2/(cid:0)¯ν¯k2(cid:1) (cid:29) 1, see third row, last line in Tab. III. With

the latter inequality, Eq. (3.5) simpliﬁes to

(3.9)

and one can now determine the slope of the square of the
growth rate

(3.10)

That scaling law that states that ¯ω2 scales with the
square root of ¯M is of great practical use, as it is shown
below.

In Eq. (3.5) two scaled material parameters appear,

where χrel is a function of the magnetic ﬁeld,

χrel =

(1 + ¯χH)
(2 + ¯χH) ·

(2 + ¯χHc)
(1 + ¯χHc)

,

(3.11)

and relates the susceptibility at the ﬁeld strength H to
the one at the critical ﬁeld Hc for the Rosensweig insta-
bility. A step towards the scaling laws is the expansion of
χrel in powers of the scaled distance of the magnetization
to the critical value, ˆM = (M − Mc, ∞)/Mc, ∞,

χrel = 1 + aχ ˆM + bχ ˆM 2 .

(3.12)

In the following we utilize this simpliﬁed description of
χrel.

By expanding ¯M , ¯ω2, and ¯k with respect to ˆM around

their critical values at the onset of the instability, too,

¯M = 1 + ˆM ,

and following the procedure outlined in Ref. [20], one
yields two scaling laws valid up to a scaled magnetiza-
tion of ˆM ≤ ¯ν2/6,

Due to their length the coeﬃcients Θ, ξ, ι, and o are

fore Eqs. (3.14) and (3.15) represent the generalization
of the results for a linear law of magnetization, i.e.
for
aχ = bχ = 0, given in Ref. [20].

To prove the quality of the simpliﬁed description of
χrel by Eq. (3.12), in Fig. 11 the experimental values of
χrel based on the magnetization curve shown in Fig. 3 are
determined by ﬁtting that magnetization by the model
proposed in Ref. [23]. The solid line represents Eq. (3.12)
with aχ = −0.1118 and bχ = −0.0097 resulting in a very
good agreement with the experimental data.

B. The ﬁnite layer approximation for a highly

viscous ﬂuids

It is known from a previous study for less viscous ﬂuids
[13] that a layer thickness of about the critical wavelength
λc is necessary to represent the case h → ∞ for the max-
imal growth rate as well as for the corresponding wave
number, as shown in Fig. 12(a, b).

That rule is no longer valid for more viscous ﬂuids like
APG E32 (λc (cid:39) 11 mm) as Fig. 12(d) displays. The re-
sults for the wave number deviate considerably from the
results of the scaling law - compare the long-dashed black
line (h = 9 mm) and the red ﬁlled circles in Fig.12(d).
By choosing a layer thickness of h = 15 mm, the results
stemming from the numerical solution of the dispersion

curve ((cid:3)) and from the second order approximation (3.12)

relation (3.1) agree rather well with the data from the
scaling laws - compare solid cyan lines and ﬁlled red cir-
cles in Fig.12(d). Note that the maximal growth rate is
not sensitive to h, as shown in Fig. 12(c). As a r´esum´e
the rule can be formulated that for magnetic ﬂuids with
high viscosities a larger ﬁlling depth than in the case of
low viscosities has to be used, in order to approximate
the results of h → ∞.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

imal growth rate states that ˆω2,m should increase mainly
linearly with ˆM as long as ˆM is not too large.

We will next compare the experimentally determined
growth rates, with the calculated ones for our particular
ﬂuid (Sect. IV A). Then we widen our scope and com-
pare as well the decay rates with the model (Sect. IV B).
Eventually some deviations are discussed in the context
of structured ferroﬂuids (Sect. IV C).

A. Comparing the growth rate in experiment and

theory

For our kind of magnetic ﬂuids it was argued in the
introduction that their high viscosity paves the way into
a scaling regime, hitherto not accessible. That claim is
now proven since a value of 87.9 for the upper bound
¯ν2/6 of the scaling regime results, as summarized in Tab.
III. That means that for experimentally feasible scaled
supercritical magnetizations ˆM the region ˆM ≤ ¯ν2/6 is
approachable. The corresponding Eq. (3.14) for the max-

To conﬁrm this scaling behavior, the experimentally
determined growth rates from Fig. 10 are plotted to-
gether with a Levenberg-Marquard ﬁt [42] of the max-
imal growth rate obtained from Eq.(3.14) versus the the
magnetisation M as shown in Fig. 13. The agreement
between both data sets is convincing.
In table IV we
present in line one the parameters for viscosity and sur-
face tension, obtained from the ﬁt. For comparison, we
reprint in line zero the measured values. The ﬁtted sur-
face tension is well within the error bars of the measured
value, whereas the ﬁtted viscosity is only 6 % below the
measured one. Thus the theoretically predicted linear
dependence of the growth rates on M is experimentally
conﬁrmed.

B. Comparing growth and decay

Next we focus as well on the experimental data for the
decay, which are plotted together with the growth data in
Fig. 14. The decay rates (•) are scattering more widely
in comparison to the growth rates ((cid:4)). This may be due
to the fact, that the decay rates could not be resolved
in the bistability range, and thus not in the immediate
vicinity of Mc, in contrast to the growth rates. The black
dashed line marks the outcome of a ﬁt of Eq (3.14) to all
experimental values. Also in this extended range the ﬁt
describes the measured growth and decay rates to some
extent.
In table IV we present in line two the ﬁt pa-
rameters for viscosity and surface tension. The ﬁtted
surface tension is well within the error bars of the mea-
sured value, whereas the ﬁtted viscosity is about 20 %
above the measured one.

Most importantly, inspecting the measured data more
closely, one observes a diﬀerent inclination for growth and
decay rates with respect to M . Obviously this system-
atic deviation is not matched by Eq. (3.14). As a possible
origin for the diﬀerent inclinations one may suspect that
utilizing the static surface tension in Eq.(3.14) is not a
suﬃcient approximation.

given in the line two of table IV. The orange dashed line marks
as well a ﬁt by Eq. (3.14), but is taking into account a growth
rate dependent surface tension, as described by Eq. (4.1). For
the parameters see line three of table IV. The solid blue line

the peaks new surface area is generated, and the diﬀu-
sion of surfactants from the bulk of the ferroﬂuid towards
the surface may lag behind. Similarly during the decay of
the peaks surface area is annihilated and the surface den-
sity of surfactants may there exceed the equilibrium con-
centration. Therefore we adopt a growth-rate-dependent
dynamic surface tension according to

σ(ω2) = σS + ω2 · ς,

(4.1)

where σS denotes the static surface tension and ς a co-

eﬃcient of dimension N· (m s)−1. In Fig. 14 the orange

dashed line marks the outcome of the ﬁt. It follows the
black dashed line, and thus can not explain the diﬀerent
inclinations.

In a next attempt to describe the diﬀerent inclinations
we postulate a growth rate dependent viscosity in the

where ϑ is a coeﬃcient of dimension Pa s2. In Fig. 14 a ﬁt
by Eq. (4.2) is marked by the solid blue line. Obviously
this phenomenological ansatz meets the data remarke-
ably well.

C. Discussion of deviations

A possible explanation of this complex behaviour is
based upon the formation of chains of magnetic parti-
cles, which is indicated by the enhanced shear thinning
as recorded in Fig. 5. The chain formation will be most
prominent in the higher magnetic ﬁeld in the spikes at
the starting amplitude Ahigh, marked in Fig. 6. These
chains are then increasing the magnetoviscosity during
the decay of the spikes, which retards the decay (cf. path
↓2 and ↓3b in Fig.6). During the decay they are partially
destroyed. As a consequence, after switching again to an
overcritical induction, the growth of the spikes (path ↑3a)
is comparatively faster. In contrast, our theory is based
on Newtonian ﬂuids. An extension to shear thinning and
structured liquids has still to be developed.

We are next comparing the critical inductions in the
last column of table IV. The static ﬁt of the growth pro-
cess yields Bc1 = 11.24 mT and deviates by only 1% from
the mean value ¯Bc = 11.36 mT obtained by a ﬁt of the full
dynamics by means of amplitude equations in Ref. [18].
All other values for Bc underestimate this value slightly
more (cf. line 2-4). In the latter three cases the growth
and decay was taken into account. This is a conforma-
tion, that mainly the decay is aﬀected by chain formation
in the spikes.

Eventually we will not hide four further eﬀects which

may have impact on our experiment:

First, the experiments are performed in a ﬁnite con-
tainer which comprises only 27 spikes on a hexagonal
lattice, whereas the theory considers a laterally inﬁnite
layer. Our ﬁnite circular size does indeed suppress the
onset of a hexagonal pattern, due to the ramp described
above.

Second, by seeding a regular hexagonal pattern at large
amplitude the selected wavelength may diﬀer from the
wavelength of maximal growth. This can in principle
shift the experimental threshold towards higher values.
However, it was demonstrated by linear stability analy-
sis that this eﬀect can be neglected in the limit of high
viscosities [39].

Third, magnetophoresis may take place in the crests
of the pattern, in this way creating an inhomogeneous
distribution of magnetite. Even though the timescale for
separation in a low viscous MF comprise days [38, 43]
and our measurements last only hours, an eﬀect can not
completely excluded.

A fourth reason may be that instead of the shear
viscosity the extensional viscosity has to be taken into

12

account in Eq.(3.1).
Indeed, besides a small viscous
sublayer, the ﬂow proﬁle of surface waves can ”be de-
scribed by a potential and is rotational free and purely
elongational” [44]. Most recently a capillary-break-up-
extensional-rheometer was subjected to magnetic ﬁelds
oriented along the direction of the capillary [45]. For
increasing ﬁelds an enlarged elongational viscosity was
observed. This eﬀect was also attributed to chain forma-
tion. However, to measure the elongational viscosity of
ferroﬂuids is a diﬃcult task, and sensitive devices have
still to be developed.

V. CONCLUSION

Using a highly viscous magnetic ﬂuid, the dynamics of
the formation of the Rosensweig instability can be slowed
down to the order of minutes. Therefore, it is possible
to measure the dynamics using a two-dimensional imag-
ing technique, in contrast to previous work [14], where
only a one-dimensional cut through the two-dimensional
pattern was accomplished. By means of a speciﬁc mea-
surement protocol we were able to seed regular patterns
of small amplitude, suitable for a comparison with lin-
ear theory. From the evolution of their amplitudes we
could estimate the linear growth and decay rates, respec-
tively. Our experiment conﬁrmed for the very ﬁrst time
a linear scaling of the growth rate with the magnetic in-
ductions, as predicted [20] for the immediate vicinity of
the bifurcation point. Thus the scaling behavior of the
growth rate is now conﬁrmed for supercritical magneti-
zations not only above [14] but also below the boundary
of the two scaling regimes at ¯ν2/6.

Additionally, we uncovered, that the rates of growth
and decay are slightly diﬀerent, a phenomenon not pre-
dicted by the theory. A possible origin of this discrepancy
is the formation of chains of magnetic particles. Their
presence in our ferroﬂuid is indicated by the magneti-
cally enhanced shear thinning. The build up of chains in
the static spikes, and their subsequent destruction dur-
ing the decay may change the eﬀective viscosity of the
structured ferroﬂuid, and thus explain the deviations.

So far our theory is based on Newtonian liquids. An
extension to shear thinning and structured ferroﬂuids is
referred to future investigations. It may be able to re-
produce the scaling of the eﬀective viscosity as described
phenomenologically by Eq. (3.6c).
