SPECTRAL THEOREM FOR QUATERNIONIC NORMAL

OPERATORS : MULTIPLICATION FORM

G. RAMESH and P. SANTHOSH KUMAR

Abstract. In this article we prove the multiplication form of a spectral the-
orem for normal operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces: Let T be a right
linear normal operator in a quaternionic Hilbert space H with the domain
D(T ) ⊂ H. We prove that for a ﬁxed unit imaginary quaternion, say m,
there exists a Hilbert basis Nm of H, a measure space (Ω, µ), a unitary oper-
ator U : H → L2(Ω; H; µ) and a µ - measurable function φ : Ω → Cm, ( here
Cm = {α + mβ; α, β ∈ R}) so that if T is expressed with respect to Nm then

T x = U ∗MφU x, for all x ∈ D(T ),

where Mφ is the multiplication operator in L2(Ω; H; µ) induced by φ with
U (D(T )) ⊆ D(Mφ).

In the process, we prove that every complex Hilbert space is a slice Hilbert
space of some quaternionic Hilbert space. Also, we prove that there exists an
anti self-adjoint, unitary operator which commutes with an unbounded normal
operator in a quaternionic Hilbert space. In proving all these results, we solve
the problem by reducing the problem to the complex case and lift it to the
quaternionic case.

1. INTRODUCTION

The theory of quaternionic Hilbert spaces is found to be useful in quaternionic
quantum mechanics. Particularly, in mathematical physics, ﬁnding the solution
of the Schrodinger equation over the skew-ﬁeld of quaternions is equivalent to the
study of diagonalization of an anti self-adjoint, unitary operator on a quaternionic
Hilbert space [6].

In quantum mechanics most of the operators which we come across are un-

bounded. In particular, this is the case in quaternionic quantum mechanics also.

One of the most important operators in quantum mechanic is the position op-
erator, which is nothing but a multiplication operator deﬁned in a Hilbert space.
This is a normal operator. In fact, it is well known in the classical theory of opera-
tors that every normal operator is a multiplication operator induced by a suitable
function. One can ask whether the same is true or not in quaternionic setting.

In this direction, upto our knowledge, only [12] dealt with such a question and
the solution of this is given by using spectral system. In this article, the author
used the simplectic image concept to obtain the result.

This question is answered for normal operators in a real Hilbert spaces by S. H.
Kulkarni and S. Agarwal in [1] using Banach algebra techniques. Both the above

results do not use the concept of the spherical spectrum of a quaternionic normal
operator.

In our case we show that an unbounded normal operator on a quaternionic
Hilbert space is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator induced by an
appropriate function. The result exactly looks like the classical one. To our surprise,
we observed that the function which determine the multiplication operator is Cm-
valued, for a ﬁxed unit imaginary quaternion m.

In proving our results we use the following approach: Given an unbounded nor-
mal operator in a quaternionic Hilbert space, we associate a unique operator in a
complex Hilbert space, which have similar properties and by using the results of the
complex operator theory, we obtain the results for quaternionic operator. Though
this technique is available in the literature (see [7] for details ), to our knowledge
we use this for the ﬁrst time. Later, we extend this technique for quaternionic
operators deﬁned between two diﬀerent Hilbert spaces.

We organize this article in four sections. In the second section we recall basic
properties of the ring of quaternions, quaternionic Hilbert spaces and operators in
quaternionic Hilbert spaces. o In the third section, we prove two main results:

• we show that every complex Hilbert space is a slice Hilbert space of a
quaternionic Hilbert space for some anti self-adjoint, unitary operator and
• a linear operator between two complex Hilbert spaces can be extended to

a unique right linear operator between quaternionic Hilbert spaces.

In the fourth section, we prove the spectral theorem (multiplication form) for right
linear bounded operators on quaternionic Hilbert spaces. In the ﬁnal section, we
prove the similar results for unbounded normal operator in quaternionic Hilbert
space by using the Z-transform. In this proof we restrict the operator to the slice
Hilbert space, then associate it to the Z- transform to get the spectral theorem for
the operator on the slice Hilbert space. Finally, we lift this result to the quaternionic
case.

2. PRELIMINARIES

Let H denotes the ring of all real quaternions. If q ∈ H, then q = q0 + q1i + q2j +

q3k, where qℓ ∈ R for each ℓ = 0, 1, 2, 3. Here i, j, k satisfy
i2 = j2 = k2 = −1 and i · j · k = −1.

For q ∈ H, the conjugate of q is q = q0 − q1i − q2j − q3k. The real part of H is
denoted by Re(H) = {q ∈ H : q = q} and the imaginary part of H is denoted by
Im(H) = {q ∈ H : q = −q} . The set S := {q ∈ Im(H) : |q| = 1} is the imaginary
unit sphere. For p, q ∈ H, we have p · q = q · p and |q| :=pq2
For m ∈ S, the ﬁled Cm := {α + mβ : α, β ∈ R} is called a slice of H. Here Cm
is isomorphic to the complex ﬁeld C through the mapping α + mβ → α + iβ. For
m 6= ±n ∈ S, we have Cm ∩ Cn = R. We also have H = Sm∈S
Cm. The positive

1 + q2

m = {α + mβ; α ∈ R, β ≥ 0}.

Note 2.1. All the results in complex Hilbert spaces holds true in the slice Cm-
Hilbert spaces, for any m ∈ S.

Relation on H: Deﬁne a relation on H by

p ∼ q ⇔ p = s−1qs, for some 0 6= s ∈ H.

SPECTRAL THEOREM: MULTIPLICATION FORM

Here ∼ is an equivalence relation on H. The equivalence class of q is given by

If Im(q) 6= 0, then q = Re(q) + Im(q)

|Im(q)| · |Im(q)|. It follows that

[q] =:= {s−1qs : 0 6= s ∈ H}.

[q] = Re(q) + |Im(q)| · S.

We have the following observations through the representation of the equivalence
classes:

(1)

for all m ∈ S, [q] ∩ Cm =(cid:26)Re(q) ± m ·

|Im(q)|(cid:27) ,

satisfying:

(1) If u ∈ H, then hu|ui = 0 ⇔ u = 0
(2) hu|v + w · qi = hu|vi + hu|wi · q, for all u, v ∈ H and q ∈ H
(3) hu|vi = hv|ui, for all u, v ∈ H,

is called an inner product on H. If we deﬁne kuk2 = hu|ui, for all u ∈ H, then k·k
is a norm on H and is called the norm induced by h·|·i. If (H,k · k) is complete
space then it is called a right quaternionic Hilbert space.

Note 2.2. Throughout the article H denotes a right quaternionic Hilbert space.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let (Ω, µ) be a measure space and ﬁx m ∈ S. If φ : Ω → Cm is
measurable, then

(1) essential supremum of φ is deﬁned by

ess sup(φ) = inf(cid:8)α : µ(cid:0){x : φ(x) > α}(cid:1) = 0(cid:9)

(2) essential range of φ is deﬁned by

ess ran(φ) := {λ : ∀ǫ > 0, µ(cid:0){x : |φ(x) − λ| = 0}(cid:1) > ǫ}
(3) φ is said to be essentially bounded if ess sup(|φ|) is ﬁnite.

Proposition 2.3. [7, Proposition 2.5] Let N be a subset of a right quaternionic
Hilbert space H such that, for z, z′ ∈ N , hz|z′i = 0 if z 6= z′ and hz|zi = 1. The
following conditions are equivalent:
(1) For every x, y ∈ H, it holds:

hx|yi = Xz∈N

hx|zihz|yi .

The above series converges absolutely

(2) For every x ∈ H, it holds:

kxk2 = Xz∈N

|hz|xi|2

(3) N ⊥ = {0}
(4) span N = H.

Proposition 2.4. [7, Proposition 2.6] Every quaternionic Hilbert space H admits
a subset N ,called Hilbert basis of H such that, for z, z′ ∈ N , hz|z′i = 0 if z 6= z′
and hz|zi = 1, and N satisﬁes equivalent conditions stated in proposition 2.3.
Furthermore, if N is Hilbert basis of H then every x ∈ H can be uniquely de-
composed as follows:

x = Xz∈N

Deﬁnition 2.6. [7, Deﬁnition 2.9] Let (H1,kk1) and (H2,kk2) be two Hilbert spaces.
A map T : H1 → H2 is said to be a right H− linear operator if

T (u · q + v) = T (u) · q + T (v),

for every u, v ∈ H1 and q ∈ H. We say that T is bounded or continuous, if there
exists K > 0 such that

is ﬁnite and it is called the norm of T .

kTk = sup{kT uk2 : u ∈ H1,kuk1 = 1}

We denote the set of all bounded right H - linear operators between H1 and H2
by B(H1, H2) and B(H, H) = B(H). If T ∈ B(H1, H2), the null space and the range
space are denoted by N (T ) and R(T ) respectively.
Deﬁnition 2.7. [7, Deﬁnition 2.12] Let T ∈ B(H). Then there exists a unique
operator T ∗ ∈ B(H) such that hu|T vi = hT ∗u|vi, for all u, v ∈ H. This operator T ∗
is called the adjoint of T.
Deﬁnition 2.8. [7, Deﬁnition 2.12] Let T ∈ B(H). Then T is said to be

(1) self-adjoint if T = T ∗
(2) positive if T = T ∗ and hx|T xi ≥ 0, for all x ∈ H
(3) anti self-adjoint if T ∗ = −T
(4) normal if T T ∗ = T ∗T

(5) unitary if T T ∗ = T ∗T = I.

Example 2.9. [12, Example 1.1] Let (Ω, µ) be σ- additive measure space and
φ : Ω → Cm be µ-measurable. Then we deﬁne the multiplication operator Mφ : L2(Ω; H; µ) →
L2(Ω; H; µ), by

Mφ(g)(x) = φ(x) · g(x), for all g ∈ L2(Ω; H; µ).

Then

φ = Mφ

(1) Mφ is a right H- linear normal.
(2) M ∗
(3) Mφ ∈ B(L2(Ω, H, µ)) if and only if φ is essentially bounded
(4) kMφk = ess sup(|φ|)
(5) M ∗

φ = Mφ ⇔ φ = φ in µ- a.e.

In the forthcoming sections we show that every normal operator in quaternionic

Hilbert space is some form of multiplication operator.
Deﬁnition 2.10. Let T ∈ B(H). A closed subspace M of H is said to be invariant
under T if T (M ) := {T u : u ∈ M} ⊆ M. Moreover, if M ⊥ is also invariant under
T then we say that M is a reducing subspace for T .

We recall the notion of the spherical spectrum of a right quaternionic linear

operator in quaternionic Hilbert space.
2.3. Spherical spectrum: [7, Deﬁnition 4.1] Let T : H → H be a right linear
operator with domain D(T ), a right linear subspace of H and q ∈ H. Deﬁne
∆q(T ) : D(T 2) → H by

∆q(T ) := T 2 − T (q + q) + I.|q|2.

The spherical resolvent of T is denoted by ρS(T ) and is the set of all q ∈ H satisfying
the following three properties:

(1) N (∆q(T )) = {0}
(2) R(∆q(T )) is dense in H
(3) ∆q(T )−1 : R(∆q(T )) → D(T 2) is bounded.

Then the spherical spectrum of T is deﬁned by setting σS(T ) = H \ ρS(T ).
Theorem 2.11. [7, Theorem 5.9] Let T ∈ B(H) be normal. Then there exists three
mutually commuting bounded operators A, B and J on H such that

T = A + J.B,

3. EXTENSION OF Cm-HILBERT SPACE TO A QUATERNIONIC

HILBERT SPACE

It is known that a Cm- linear operator in a slice Hilbert space H Jm

+ can be
extended uniquely to a right linear operator in H [7].
In this section we prove
that a linear operator in any Cm- Hilbert space K can be extended uniquely to a
quaternionic linear operator in some quaternionic Hilbert space H associated to K.
This is possible by showing that every Cm- Hilbert space is a slice Hilbert space
of some quaternionic Hilbert space, with respect to some anti self-adjoint, unity
operator J.

+ is a closed subset of H.

+ is also separable. It is clear from the deﬁnition of H Jm

Remark 3.4. In particular, if T ∈ B(H) is non self-adjoint, normal, there exist
an anti self-adjoint, unitary J ∈ B(H) such that T J = J T (see [7, Theorem 5.9]).
If T ∈ B(H) is self-adjoint, then the existence of such J is given in [7, Theorem
5.7(b)]. Hence all the results of Proposition 3.3 holds true for normal operators.

quaternionic Hilbert space and for some anti self-adjoint, unitary J. Later we

Hilbert spaces.

operators in slice Hilbert space of H.

Proposition 3.6. Let K be a Cm - Hilbert space. Then there is a quaternionic
Hilbert space H and an anti self-adjoint, unitary J ∈ B(H) such that

K = H Jm
+ .

Proof. Deﬁne H := K × K. We deﬁne binary operations on H as follows:

(x, y) + (z, w) = (x + z, y + w), for all (x, y), (z, w) ∈ H.

For q ∈ H we can write q = α + β · n, for some α, β ∈ Cm, where n ∈ S is such that
m · n = −n · m. Then
(4)
Let us denote the inner product on K by h·|·iK. Deﬁne h·|·i : H × H → H by

(x, y) · (α + β · n) = (x · α − y · β , x · β − y · α).

h(x, y)|(z, w)i = [hx|ziK + hw|yiK] + [hx|wiK − hz|yiK] · n.

Using the fact that h·|·iK is an inner product on K, it can be shown that h·|·i is an
inner product on H. The completeness of h·|·iK implies that H is complete with
respect to the norm, k(x, y)k2 = kxk2 +kyk2 which is induced from the above inner
product. There fore H is a right quaternionic Hilbert space.
If we identify x of K by (x, 0) of H and y of K by (y, 0) of H, then the following

identiﬁcation holds:

(x, y) = (x, 0) + (0, y) = (x, 0) + (y, 0) · n

= x + y · n.

Here we used Equation (4) to conclude (0, y) = (y, 0) · n.

Deﬁne J : H → H by

J(x + y · n) = (x − y · n) · m, for all x + y · n ∈ H.

8

G. RAMESH and P. SANTHOSH KUMAR

We shall prove that J is anti self-adjoint and unitary. If x + y · n, z + w · n ∈ H
then

hx + y · n|J(z + w · n)i = hx + y · n|(z − w · n) · mi

= hx|(z − w · n) · mi + hy|(z − w · n) · mi
= hx · m|z + w · ni + hy · m · n|z + w · ni
= h(−x + y · n) · m|z + w · ni .

It remains to show that H Jm

Therefore J ∗(x + y· n) = (−x + y· n)· m, for all x + y· n ∈ H. This implies J ∗ = −J
and J ∗J = J J ∗ = I.
+ , then J(x + y · n) =
(x + y · n) · m. By the deﬁnition of J, it follows that y = 0. Conversely, if x ∈ K
then J(x) = x · m. Hence K = H Jm
+ .

+ = K. If x + y · n ∈ H Jm

(cid:3)

From Proposition 3.6 it is clear that for a ﬁxed m ∈ S, a linear operator on
any Cm- Hilbert space can be extended uniquely to the corresponding quaternionic
Hilbert space.

We prove the following lemma to give the relation between the spectrum of T

and the spherical spectrum of eT .

Lemma 3.7. Let T : H Jm
of T as given in Proposition 3.3. Then

+ be bounded Cm - linear and eT be the extension

σS(eT ) = {[λ] : λ ∈ σ(T )} .

Proof. If λ ∈ σ(T ), then (T − λ · I) is not invertible. We show that ∆λ(T ) is
not invertible. Suppose ∆λ(T ) is invertible, there exists L ∈ B(H) such that
L∆λ(T ) = ∆λ(T )L = I. This implies (T − λ · I)L = L(T − λ · I). Equivalently,
This is contradiction. Therefore ∆λ(T ) is not invertible. We claim that ∆µ(eT ) is
not invertible for every µ ∈ [λ]. If ∆µ(eT ) is invertible for some µ ∈ [λ], then by

(T − λ · I)[(T − λ · I)L] = [(T − λ · I)L](T − λ · I) = L.

Equation (3) and Proposition 3.3(3), we have

This is contradiction to λ ∈ σ(T ). Hence

∆µ(eT )−1 = e∆µ(T )−1 = e∆λ(T )−1.

{[λ] : λ ∈ σ(T )} ⊆ σS(eT ).

σS(eT ) = {[λ] : λ ∈ σ(T )}.

On the other hand if q ∈ σs(eT ), then λ := Re(q) + m · |Im(q)| ∈ [q] ∈ σS(eT ). By
[7, Proposition 5.11(c)], we have λ ∈ σS(eT ) ∩ C+

m = σ(T ). Thus

This implies that extension eT of T is unique.
Since eT is the extension of T , it follows that kTk ≤ keTk. If x = x1 + x2 ∈ H then

U x = V x, for all x ∈ D(U ).

Conversely, assume that J2V = V J1. That is J2V x = V J1x,∀ x ∈ D(V ). This
means that J1x ∈ D(V ), for every x ∈ D(V ). Hence V (D(V )T H J1m
Deﬁne U : D(V )T H J1m
Here V is right H- linear extension of U such that J1(D(V )) ⊂ D(V ), by the

unitary J ∈ B(L2(cid:0)Ω; H; µ)(cid:1). To establish this result, we need the following theorem.
Theorem 3.9. Let m, n ∈ S be such that m · n = −n · m. Let (Ω, µ) be a mea-
sure space. Then L2(Ω; Cm; µ) is closed in L2(Ω; H; µ). More over, we represent
L2(Ω; H; µ) as {f + g · n|f, g ∈ L2(Ω; Cm; µ)}, where

Our aim is to prove that L2(Ω; Cm; µ) = L2(Ω; H; µ)Jm

+ for some anti self-adjoint,

(cid:3)

(f + g · n)(x) = f (x) + g(x) · n, for all x ∈ Ω.

Proof. If f ∈ L2(Ω; H; µ), then f (x) = αx + βx · n, for every x ∈ Ω, where αx, βx ∈
Cm. Deﬁne f1(x) = αx and f2(x) = βx. For l = 1, 2 the map fl : Ω → Cm satisﬁes

Z

|fl(x)|2dµ(x) ≤Z

|f (x)|2dµ(x) < ∞.

Hence f1, f2 ∈ L2(Ω; Cm; µ).

Deﬁne Ψ : L2(Ω; H; µ) → {f + g · n|f, g ∈ L2(Ω; Cm; µ)} by

Ψ(f ) = f1 + f2 · n, for every f ∈ L2(Ω; H; µ).

Here {f + g · n|f, g ∈ L2(Ω; Cm; µ)} is right quaternionic Hilbert space. Clearly, Ψ
is well deﬁned,right H- linear onto map. Next, we show that Ψ is an isometry. Let
f ∈ L2(Ω; H; µ). Then

kΨ(f )k2 =Z

|f1(t)|2dµ(t) +Z

Ω

Thus Ψ is an isometrically isomorphism. It remains to show that L2(Ω; Cm; µ) is
closed. Let {fk} be a sequence in L2(Ω; Cm; µ). If {fk} converges to f = f1 + f2 · n

in L2(Ω; H; µ), then

kfk − fk2 = k(fk − f1) − f2 · nk2
= kfk − f1k2 + kf2k2.

Since fk → f , it follows that kfk − f1k2 → 0, as n → ∞ and f2 = 0. Therefore
L2(Ω; Cm; µ) is closed in L2(Ω; H; µ).
Corollary 3.10. There exists J ∈ B(L2(Ω; H; µ)), an anti self-adjoint, unitary

4. SPECTRAL THEOREM: BOUNDED OPERATORS

In this section we prove the spectral theorem (multiplication form) for bounded

normal operators on a quaternionic Hilbert space.

We recall the spectral theorem for bounded normal operators on complex Hilbert

spaces.
Theorem 4.1. [4, Theorem 11.5] If N ∈ B(H) is a normal operator then there is a
measure space (X, µ) and an essentially bounded µ- measurable function φ : X → C
such that N is unitarily equivalent to Lφ, where Lφ is a left multiplication by φ
acting on L2(X; C; µ).

More over, if H is separable then the measure space obtained above (X, µ) is σ-

ﬁnite.

We prove the multiplication form of normal operator on quaternionic Hilbert
+ to

spaces by using Proposition3.3(1), the extension of Cm-linear operator on H Jm
the linear operator on quaternionic Hilbert space H.

MULTIPLICATION FORM:.

Theorem 4.2. Let T ∈ B(H) be normal and ﬁx m ∈ S. Then there exists

(a) a Hilbert basis Nm of H
(b) a measure space (Ω, µ)
(c) a unitary operator U : H → L2(Ω; H; µ) and
(d) an essentially bounded µ- measurable function φ : Ω → Cm

so that if T is expressed with respect to Nm, then
T = U ∗MφU,

where Mφ is a bounded multiplication operator on L2(Ω; H; µ).

Moreover,
(1) kTk = ess sup(|φ|)
(2) σS(T ) = {[λ] : λ ∈ ess ran (φ)}.

Further more, if H is separable Hilbert space, then the obtained measure space (Ω, µ)
is σ- ﬁnite.

Proof. By Proposition 3.3, T+ : H Jm

operator such that eT+ = T . Let Nm be Hilbert basis for H Jm
2.13, Nm is Hilbert basis for H and moreover,

+ is a Cm- linear bounded normal
+ then by Remark

By Theorem 4.1, there exist a measure space (Ω, µ), a Cm- valued µ- measurable
function φ on Ω and a unitary operator U+ : H Jm

+ → L2(Ω; Cm; µ) such that

T+ = U ∗

+LφU+,

where Lφ : L2(Ω; Cm; µ) → L2(Ω; Cm; µ) is deﬁned by

Lφ(g)(t) = φ(t) · g(t), for all g ∈ L2(Ω; Cm; µ).
By Theorem 3.3, we have eLφ : L2(Ω; H; µ) → L2(Ω; H; µ) given by
Let us denote eLφ by Mφ. It is clear that Mφ is a right H- linear and Mφ|L2(Ω;Cm;µ) =
Lφ. For h = h1 + h2 · n ∈ L2(Ω; H; µ) and x ∈ Ω, we have

eLφ(g + h · n) = Lφ(g) + Lφ(h) · n, for all g, h ∈ L2(Ω; Cm; µ).

Mφ(h1 + h2 · n)(x) = Lφ(h1)(x) + Lφ(h2)(x) · n

= φ(x) · h1(x) + φ(x) · h2(x) · n
= φ(x)(h1(x) + h2(x) · n)
= φ · (h1 + h2)(x).

That is Mφ is a multiplication operator induced by φ. By Theorem 3.8, U+ has a
unique extension U : H → L2(Ω; H; µ) such that

U (a + b) = U+(a) − U+(b · n) · n, for all a ∈ H Jm

+ , b ∈ H Jm
− .

Therefore, for all a ∈ H Jm

+ and b ∈ H Jm

− , we have

U ∗MφU (a + b) = U ∗Mφ(U+(a) − U+(b · n) · n)

+LφU+(a) + U ∗

= T (a + b).

+(LφU+(b · n) · n · n) · n
+LφU+(b · n) · n

Hence U ∗MφU = T .

Proof of (1): It is clear from Proposition 3.3(1), that kTk = kT+k and since
Proof of (2): We know that σ(T+) = ess ran(φ). By Lemma 3.7, we have

kT+k = ess sup(|φ|), we have kTk = ess sup(|φ|).

σS(T ) = {[λ] : λ ∈ ess ran(φ)}

If H is separable, by Lemma 3.1 H Jm
(Ω, µ) is σ- ﬁnite.

+ is separable. Therefore by Theorem 4.1,

Corollary 4.3. Let T ∈ B(H) be anti self-adjoint operator and ﬁx m ∈ S. Then,
there exists Hilbert basis Nm, a measure space (Ω; µ), a µ - measurable purely
imaginary function ξ : Ω → Cm and a unitary operator U : H → L2(Ω; H; µ) so
that if T is expressed with respect to Nm then

T = U ∗MξU.
In particular, T is unitary ⇔ |ξ| = 1 in µ- a.e.
Proof. By Theorem 4.2, we have T = U ∗MξU . Since T is anti self-adjoint, T ∗ =
−T . It follows that U ∗MξU = U ∗M−ξU .

This implies ξ = −ξ. In particular,
T is unitary ⇔ T ∗T = T T ∗ = I
⇔ U ∗M|ξ|2U = I
⇔ U ∗M|ξ|2U = U ∗M1U (Here M1 is the identity on L2(Ω; H; µ))
⇔ |ξ| = 1, µ - a.e.

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.4. Let T ∈ B(H) be normal. Then T and T ∗ are unitarily equivalent.
Proof. By Theorem 4.2, there exists a measure space (Ω, µ), µ- measurable Cm-
valued function ξ on Ω and a unitary U : H → L2(Ω; H; µ) such that T = U ∗MξU .
This implies T ∗ = U ∗MξU .

Clearly, φ is non-zero a.e (µ), ess sup (|φ|) = 1 and Mφ is a right linear, unitary

Example 4.5. Let φ(t) = (i − j − k)t, for all t ∈ [0, 1] . Then φ is essen-
tially bounded measurable function with the Lebesgue measure µ on [0, 1]. Deﬁne
Mφ : L2 ([0, 1]; H; µ) → L2([0, 1]; H; µ) by

Mφ(g)(t) = φ(t) · g(t) for all g ∈ L2([0, 1]; H; µ).

We show that Mφ is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator on L2([0, 1]; H; µ)
induced by some complex valued measurable function.

Deﬁne U : L2([0, 1]; H; µ) → L2([0, 1]; H; µ) by

U (g)(t) =

This example 4.5 infers that every multiplication operator induced by quaternion

complex valued function.

5. SPECTRAL THEOREM: UNBOUNDED OPERATORS

In this section we prove the spectral theorem ( multiplication form ) for un-
bounded normal operator in a quaternionic Hilbert space. For this, we restrict
the operator to the slice Hilbert space, associate a bounded operator to the re-
stricted operator through the Z- transform then by using Theorem 4.1, we obtain
the result. Analogous to the complex Hilbert spaces, the theory of unbounded op-
erators in quaternionic Hilbert space is studied in [7]. We recall some properties of
unbounded operators in quaternionic Hilbert space, that we need for our purpose.
Deﬁnition 5.1. [10, Deﬁnition 13.1] Let T : D(T ) ⊂ H1 → H2 be a right linear
operator with domain D(T ), a right linear subspace of H1. Then T is said to be
densely deﬁned, if D(T ) is dense in H1.

The graph of an operator T is denoted by G(T ) and is deﬁned as

G(T ) = {(x, T x)|x ∈ D(T )} .

Deﬁnition 5.2. Let T : H1 → H2 be right linear with domain D(T ) ⊂ H1. Then
T is said to be closed, if the graph G(T ) is closed in H1 × H2. Equivalently, if
(xn) ⊂ D(T ) with xn → x ∈ H1 and T xn → y, then x ∈ D(T ) and T x = y.

Let S, T be densely deﬁned closed operators with domains D(S),D(T ), respec-
tively. Then S is said to be a restriction of T denoted by S ⊂ T , if D(S) ⊆ D(T )
and Sx = T x, for all x ∈ D(S). In this case, T is called an extension of S.
Deﬁnition 5.3. An operator T with domain D(T ) is said to be normal, if T is
densely deﬁned, closed and T ∗T = T T ∗.
Deﬁnition 5.4. Let T : D(T ) → H be densely deﬁned closed operator and S ∈
B(H), then we say that S commute with T if ST ⊆ T S. In other words, Sx ∈ D(T )
and ST x = T Sx, for all x ∈ D(T ).

Recall that if T ∈ B(H) is normal, then by Remark 3.4 there exists a J ∈ B(H)
anti self-adjoint, unitary such that T J = J T . We generalize this result to the case
of densely deﬁned, closed right linear operators.

following properties:

Theorem 5.6. Let T : D(T ) → H be normal with D(T ) ⊂ H. Then there exists
an anti self-adjoint unitary operator J ∈ B(H) such that J commutes with T .
Proof. It is clear from the Theorem 5.5, that ZT is a bounded right linear normal
operator. By Proposition 2.11, there exists an anti self-adjoint and unitary operator
J ∈ B(H) such that ZT J = JZT and JZ ∗
T J. This implies that J(I −
TZT ) = (I − Z ∗
Z ∗
TZT )J. So J commutes with the square roof of bounded positive
operator (I − Z ∗
TZT ), that is J(I − Z ∗
TZT )
2 J.
Now we show that J commutes with the inverse of (I − Z ∗
unbounded operator. Let x ∈ D((I − Z ∗

If η(z) = z on Ω0, then Lη : D(Lη) → L2(Ω0; Cm; ν) deﬁnes a right linear
operator in L2(Ω; Cm; µ) with the domain D(Lη) = {g ∈ L2(Ω0; Cm; ν)|η · g ∈
L2(Ω0; Cm; ν)}. We establish a unitary between L2(Ω; Cm; µ) and L2(Ω0; Cm; ν) as
follows:

Deﬁne π : L2(Ω; Cm; µ) → L2(Ω0; Cm; ν) by

π(g) = g ◦ ξ−1, for all g ∈ L2(Ω; Cm; µ).

SPECTRAL THEOREM: MULTIPLICATION FORM

Ω

This shows that π is one to one. If h ∈ L2(Ω0; Cm; ν), then h ◦ ξ ∈ L2(Ω; Cm; µ)
and π(h ◦ ξ) = h.

Let g ∈ L2(Ω; Cm; µ) and h ∈ L2(Ω0; Cm; ν). Then

This implies π∗(h) = h ◦ ξ, for all h ∈ L2(Ω0; Cm; ν). It can be veriﬁed that

V+ between H Jm

This shows π∗Lηπ = Lψ.

Deﬁne V+ : H Jm

Now extend the operator T+ to the operator T in H by using Theorem 3.3 and
Theorem 3.8. The rest of the proof follows in the similar lines as in the case of

bounded operators. Let fLη = Mη and fV+ = V . Then by extension of T+ we get

T x = V MηV x, for all x ∈ D(T ).
where Mη is the multiplication operator in L2(Ω0; H; ν).

If H is separable, then µ is σ- ﬁnite by Theorem 4.2. Therefore ν is also σ- ﬁnite.
