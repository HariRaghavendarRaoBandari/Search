Abstract

Using derivative expansion applied to the Wigner transform of the two - point Green function we analyse the
anomalous quantum Hall eﬀect (AQHE), and the chiral magnetic eﬀect (CME). The corresponding currents
are proportional to the momentum space topological invariants. We reproduce the conventional expression
for the Hall conductivity in 2 + 1 D. In 3 + 1 D our analysis allows to explain systematically the AQHE
in topological insulators and Weyl semimetals. At the same time using this method we prove, that the
equilibrium CME is absent in the wide class of solids, as well as in the properly regularized relativistic
quantum ﬁeld theory.

1. Introduction

Momentum space topology is becoming the important tool for the study of the ground states of con-
densed matter systems (for the review see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). In particular, the momentum space topological
invariants protect gapless fermions on the boundaries of topological insulators [6, 7]. Topological invariants
in momentum space protect also the bulk gapless fermions in Dirac and Weyl semi - metals [9, 8]. The
large variety of topological defects and textures exist in the fermionic superﬂuids, and the gapless fermions
associated with these objects are described by momentum space topology [10]. Momentum space topology
was also discussed in the context of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 9, 16, 17, 18].
In [19] the topological invariants in momentum space have been considered for the lattice regularization of
QFT with Wilson fermions. Appearance of the massless fermions at the intermediate values of bare mass
parameter was related to the jump of the introduced momentum space topological invariant. This invariant
may actually be used for the description of a certain class of topological insulators2. In [20] the model with
overlap fermions has been considered on the same grounds. In particular, the possible physical meaning of
the zeros of the Green function has been discussed. The appearance of zeros of the Green function, in turn,
has been discussed in the context of condensed matter physics (see, for example, [21]).

The momentum space topological invariants are expressed in terms of the Green functions. Therefore,
they are applicable both to the non - interacting and to the interacting systems [9]. Suppose, that we start
from the model without interactions. When the interactions are turned on, the value of the topological
invariant is not changed until the phase transition is encountered. This means, that the properties of the
system described by the given topological invariant are robust to the introduction of interactions. The more
simple non - interacting model may be investigated in order to describe such properties of the complicated
interacting system. In the present paper we apply momentum space topology to the description of the two
particular examples of the non - dissipative transport eﬀects - anomalous quantum Hall eﬀect (AQHE) and
chiral magnetic eﬀect (CME).

2This pattern is complimentary to that of [7], where in the similar way the number of boundary gapless fermions is related

to the jump of the topological invariant across the boundary in coordinate space.

Actually, momentum space topology with topological invariants expressed through the Green functions
represents the alternative to the less powerful but more popular technique of Berry curvature proposed
to describe the QHE in [22] and developed later in a number of publications (see, for example, [23] and
references therein). The technique of Berry curvature may be applied to the noninteracting condensed
matter systems with Green function of the form G−1 = iω − ˆH, where ω is the imaginary frequency while ˆH
is the Hamiltonian. Unfortunately, this formalism does not allow to deal in a similar way with the interacting
systems with more complicated dependence of the Green function on the imaginary frequency. Besides, in
spite of all its advantages, the Berry curvature formalism does not allow to describe the response of the system
to the external magnetic (rather than electric) ﬁeld. Finally, the bulk - boundary correspondence remains out
of this formalism. Those three points are improved in the technique that utilizes the topological invariants
composed directly of the Green functions. It was proposed ﬁrst by G.E.Volovik (see [9, 6] and references
therein). In the present paper we develop this technique and give the relation between the electromagnetic
response of electric current and the topological invariants in momentum space of both 2 + 1D and 3 + 1D
systems. Those topological invariants are constructed of the Wigner transform of the two - point Green
functions, which allows to apply the proposed methodology to the direct description of bulk - boundary
correspondence. As for the Berry curvature formalism, we demonstrate that it follows from our approach as
a particular case.

The family of the non - dissipative transport eﬀects related to chiral anomaly has been widely discussed
recently both in the context of the high energy physics and in the context of condensed matter theory
[24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 32, 33, 34]. In particular, the possible appearance of such eﬀects in the
recently discovered Dirac and Weyl semimetals has been considered [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Besides,
the possibility to observe those eﬀects in relativistic heavy - ion collisions was proposed [42, 43]. The chiral
magnetic eﬀect (CME) is the generation of electric current in the presence of external magnetic ﬁeld and
chiral chemical potential [44, 45]. The quantum Hall eﬀect in the 2 + 1 D and the 3 + 1 D systems is the
appearance of electric current in the direction orthogonal to the direction of the applied electric ﬁeld. The
anomalous quantum Hall eﬀect (AQHE) is such an eﬀect that takes place due to the internal properties of the
system rather than due to the external magnetic ﬁeld. Recently its possible appearance in Weyl semimetals
has been widely discussed [40, 41]. The AQHE was also discussed in the 3 + 1D topological insulators [23].
In the present paper we consider both AQHE and CME on the same grounds within the lattice regularized
quantum ﬁeld theory and within the tight - binding models of the solid state physics. The expression of
the Hall current (through the topological invariant in momentum space ˜N3) in the quasi two dimensional
condensed matter systems is well - known [9, 46]. We reproduce this result basing on the technique of the
derivative expansion applied to the Wigner transform of the two - point Green function. Next, we apply
the same technique to the AQHE in the 3 + 1 D lattice models. The obtained expression relates the AQHE
current to the new topological invariant. The technique of its calculation is developed. Our methodology
allows to predict the appearance of the AQHE both in the Weyl semi - metals and in the insulators of certain
class.

Using the same technique we consider also the equilibrium CME. It appears, that the resulting current
is also proportional to the topological invariant in momentum space. Unlike the case of the naive continuum
fermions for the lattice model with regular fermionic Green function the value of the mentioned topological
invariant does not depend on the chiral chemical potential. We consider the case, when the lattice Dirac
fermions are massive. However, the limit, when the physical Dirac mass tends to zero, does not change our
conclusion. This means, that the equilibrium bulk CME current is absent for the lattice regularized quantum
ﬁeld theory and in the wide class of solids including Dirac semimetals.

Notice, that our conclusions on AQHE and CME are in accordance with the recent consideration of the
particular lattice model of Weyl semimetals [47]. The conclusion on the absence of the equilibrium bulk CME
is in line with the recent numerical calculations made using the particular lattice models [31, 32, 32, 33, 34].
It also does not contradict to the consideration of the eﬀective continuum ﬁeld theoretic description of
Weyl/Dirac semimetals [29]. Besides, this conclusion is in accordance with the Bloch theorem [48].

In order to express the response of electric current to external gauge ﬁeld through the topological invariant
in momentum space we incorporate the slowly varying external gauge ﬁeld directly to the momentum space
representation of the lattice model.
In this representation it appears as a pseudo - diﬀerential operator
A(i∂p), where A(r) determines the functional dependence of the gauge ﬁeld on coordinates, while ∂p is the

2

derivative over momentum. Such an introduction of the gauge ﬁeld to the lattice model deforms it at small
distances (of the order of the lattice spacing). However, the gauge invariance remains intact, and at large
distances the theory is indistinguishable from the lattice model with the external gauge ﬁeld introduced in a
conventional way. Therefore, the given way to introduce the electromagnetic ﬁeld satisﬁes all requirements
to be imposed on the lattice regularization of the QFT. We also consider this appropriate to apply this
method to the lattice models of solid state physics if the long range phenomena are to be investigated.
We demonstrate explicitly, that in the particular case of the noninteracting condensed matter system our
formalism allows to reproduce the expression for the Hall conductivity as an integral over the Berry curvature
(the Green function of such system has the form G−1 = iω − ˆH, where ω is the imaginary frequency while
ˆH is the Hamiltonian).

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sect. 2 we describe the way to introduce the slowly varying
external gauge ﬁeld to the momentum space formulation of lattice model. In Sect. 3 we consider Wigner
transformation of the two - point Green function in momentum space. The linear response of electric current
to external ﬁeld strength is considered in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we reproduce the expression for the QHE
current in the 2 + 1 D systems using the developed methodology.
In Sect. 6 we demonstrate, how the
formalism of Berry curvature follows from our expressions. In Sect. 7 we consider the AQHE in the 3 + 1D
systems. In Sect. 8 we discuss bulk - boundary correspondence for the topological insulators with AQHE.
The considerations of Sect. 7 are illustrated by two particular models of insulators in Sect. 9, and by two
particular models of Weyl semimetal in Sect. 10. In Sect. 11 we analyse using this methodology the CME,
and demonstrate, that it is absent in the considered systems. In Sect. 12 we end with the conclusions.

2. External gauge ﬁeld as a pseudo - diﬀerential operator in momentum space

We consider the d + 1 = D dimensional lattice model of non - interacting fermions. In this way the tight
- binding models of solid state physics as well as the lattice regularization of the continuum quantum ﬁeld
theory (QFT) may be described. In momentum space the fermionic Green function G(p) depends on the
D vector p = (p1, ..., pD) of Euclidean momentum. Momentum space is supposed to have the form of the
product M = S1 ⊗ Ω or M = R1 ⊗ Ω, where Ω is the compact d - dimensional Brillouin zone. Here R1 is the
line of the imaginary frequencies pD. In the lattice regularization of QFT the values of pD correspond to S1.
In condensed matter physics the representation of the theory with momentum space M = S1 ⊗ Ω appears if
the evolution in time is discretized. In particular, momentum space of such form appears in the application
of the numerical lattice methods to the calculation of the functional integrals in the solid state physics. In
the conventional lattice models deﬁned on the hypercubic lattice Ω has the form of the d - dimensional
torus3. In the solid state physics the form of the Brillouin zone is typically more complicated.

In the absence of the external electromagnetic ﬁeld the partition function of the theory deﬁned on the

inﬁnite lattice may be written as

Z = Z D ¯ΨDΨ exp(cid:16) −ZM

dDp
|M|

¯Ψ(p)G−1(p)Ψ(p)(cid:17)

(1)

where |M| is the volume of momentum space M, while ¯Ψ and Ψ are the Grassmann - valued ﬁelds deﬁned
in momentum space M. For example, the model with 3 + 1 D Wilson fermions that describes qualitatively
a certain class of topological insulators corresponds to G that has the form

G(p) = (cid:16)Xk

γkgk(p) − im(p)(cid:17)−1

(2)

where γk are Euclidean Dirac matrices while gk(p) and m(p) are the real - valued functions (k = 1, 2, 3, 4)
given by

gk(p) = sin pk, m(p) = m(0) + Xa=1,2,3,4

(1 − cos pa)

(3)

3Notice, that the lattice momentum p does not appear as the eigenvalue of the operator −i∂r.

The ﬁelds in coordinate space are related to the ﬁelds in momentum space as follows

Ψ(r) = ZM

|M|

eiprΨ(p)

(4)

At the discrete values of r corresponding to the points of the lattice this expression gives the values of the
fermionic ﬁeld at these points, i.e. the dynamical variables of the original lattice model. However, Eq. (4)
allows to deﬁne formally the values of ﬁelds at any other values of r. The partition function may be rewritten
in the form

Z = Z D ¯ΨDΨ exp(cid:16) −Xrn

¯Ψ(rn)hG−1(−i∂r)Ψ(r)ir=rn(cid:17)

(5)

Here the sum in the exponent is over the discrete coordinates rn. However, the operator −i∂r acts on the
function Ψ(r) deﬁned using Eq. (4). In order to derive Eq. (5) we use identity

eipr = |M|δ(p)

Xr

(6)

In the particular case of Wilson fermions4 we may rewrite the partition function in the conventional way as

Z = Z D ¯ΨDΨ exp(cid:16) − Xrn,rm

¯Ψ(rm)(−iDrn,rm)Ψ(rn)(cid:17)

with

Dx,y = −

[(1 + γi)δx+ei,y + (1 − γi)δx−ei,y] + (m(0) + 4)δxy

(7)

(8)

Here ei is the unity vector in the i - th direction. Gauge transformation of the lattice ﬁeld takes the form

Ψ(rn) → eiα(rn)Ψ(rn)

(9)

In case of Wilson fermions the U (1) gauge ﬁeld is typically introduced as the following modiﬁcation of
operator D:

Dx,y = −

1

2 Xi

[(1 + γi)δx+ei,yeiAx+ei,y + (1 − γi)δx−ei,yeiAx−ei ,y ] + (m(0) + 4)δxy

(10)

Here Ax,y = −Ay,x is the gauge ﬁeld attached to the links of the lattice. In the same way the gauge ﬁeld is
typically incorporated into the models of solid state physics.

Below we propose the alternative way of the introduction of gauge ﬁeld into the lattice model. First of all,
Eq. (9) may be understood as the gauge transformation of the ﬁeld Ψ deﬁned for any values of r: we simply
extend the deﬁnition of the function α(r) to the function, which is deﬁned at any values of r and take the
original values at the discrete lattice points. This prompts the following way to introduce the external gauge
ﬁeld to our lattice model. Suppose, that we need to put on the lattice the gauge ﬁeld, which in continuum
theory has the form of the function A(r) of the continuum coordinate r. We consider the partition function
of the form

Z = Z D ¯ΨDΨ exp(cid:16) −
−A(r))Ψ(r)ir=rn

h ¯Ψ(rn)hG−1(−i∂r

1

2 Xrn
+ (h.c.)i(cid:17)

(11)

Here by (h.c.) we denote the Hermitian conjugation, which is deﬁned as follows. First of all, it relates the
components of Grassmann variable Ψ with the corresponding components of ¯Ψ. Besides, it inverses the

topological insulators.

ordering of operators and the variables ¯Ψ, Ψ, and substitutes each operator by its Hermitian conjugated.
For example, a conjugation of ¯Ψ ˆB(i∂ri1 )...(i∂rin )Ψ for a certain operator (in internal space) ˆB is given by
h(−i∂ri1 )...(−i∂rin ) ¯Ψi ˆB+Ψ. As well as in continuum theory operators ˆpi − Ai(r) and ˆpj − Aj (r) do not
commute for i 6= j. Therefore, we should point out the way of their ordering inside G−1(−i∂r − A(r)). We
choose the following way for deﬁniteness: each product pi1...pin in the expansion of G−1 is substituted by
the symmetrized product 1
n! Ppermutations(ˆpi1 − Ai1 )...(ˆpin − Ain ). This method of introducing the gauge
ﬁeld to the lattice model diﬀers from the more conventional ways, but it is manifestly gauge invariant, i.e.
the exponent in Eq. (11) is invariant under the transformation of Eq. (9) if we transform the gauge ﬁeld as

A(r) → A(r) + ∂rα(r)

(12)

where α is the extension to the continuous values of r of the function of Eq. (9) deﬁned on the discrete lattice
points rn. Besides, the partition function of Eq. (11) is obviously reduced to the conventional continuum
partition function with the minimal connection of fermion ﬁeld with the gauge ﬁeld in the naive continuum
limit. Thus, the proposed way of the incorporation of the external gauge ﬁeld into the lattice theory satisﬁes
all requirements to be fulﬁlled by the introduction of the gauge ﬁeld in lattice regularization of quantum
ﬁeld theory.

In case of the models of the solid state physics the proposed introduction of the external gauge ﬁeld
deforms the theory at the interatomic distances. However, the gauge invariance remains intact, and the
long distance behavior of the theory should remain the same. Therefore, we consider this appropriate to
incorporate the slow varying gauge ﬁeld to the solid state lattice models in this way.

Now let us come back to momentum space. One can easily check, that Eq. (11) may be rewritten as

Z = Z D ¯ΨDΨ exp(cid:16) −ZM

dDp
|M|

¯Ψ(p) ˆQ(i∂p, p)Ψ(p)(cid:17)

Here

ˆQ = G−1(p − A(i∂p))

(13)

(14)

while the pseudo - diﬀerential operator A(i∂p) is deﬁned as follows. First, we represent the original gauge
ﬁeld A(r) as a series in powers of coordinates r. Next, variable r is substituted in this expansion by the
operator i∂p.

In order to prove Eq. (13) we introduce the function Qright that is constructed of G−1 as follows. We
represent G−1(−i∂r − A(r)) as a series in powers of −i∂r and A(r) such that in each term A(r) stand right
to −i∂r. For example, we represent (−i∂r − A(r))2 as (−i∂r)2 − 2(−i∂r)A(r) + A2(r) − i(∂A). Next, we
substitute the argument of A by i∂p and −i∂r by p. Correspondingly, Qlef t is deﬁned with the inverse
ordering. With these deﬁnitions one may easily prove, that Eq. (11) is equivalent to

Z = Z D ¯ΨDΨ exp(cid:16) −

|M|h ¯Ψ(p)Qright(i∂p, p)Ψ(p)

+ ¯Ψ(p)Qlef t(i∂p, p)Ψ(p)i(cid:17)

after the substitution of Eq. (4). Since the commutators [−i∂ri, rj] = iδj
each other, the actual expression for 1
Green function of our system in momentum space satisﬁes equation

i are equal to
2hQright(i∂p, p) + Qlef t(i∂p, p)i is given by Eq. (14). Finally, the

i and [pi, i∂pj ] = iδj

ˆQ(i∂p1, p1)G(p1, p2) = |M|δ(D)(p1 − p2)

(16)

3. Wigner transform in momentum space

According to the proposed above way to incorporate gauge ﬁeld into the lattice model the Green function

in momentum space appears as a correlator

G(p1, p2) =

Z Z D ¯ΨDΨ ¯Ψ(p2)Ψ(p1)
exp(cid:16) −Z dDp

|M|

¯Ψ(p) ˆQ(i∂p, p)Ψ(p)(cid:17)

(17)

5

It obeys equation Eq. (16). Wigner transform [49, 53, 50, 51, 52] of the Green function may be deﬁned as

˜G(R, p) = Z dDP

|M|

eiPRG(p + P/2, p − P/2)

In terms of the Green function in coordinate space this Green function is expressed as:

˜G(R, p) = Xr=rn

e−iprG(R + r/2, R − r/2)

where

G(r1, r2) =

(18)

(19)

(20)

In Appendix A we prove, that this Green function obeys the Groenewold equation (see also Appendix B

of [51]):

(21)

As well as in continuum case the Weyl symbol [51, 52] of operator ˆQ is given by function Q that depends
on the real numbers rather than on the operators. As it is explained in Appendix A, if ˆQ has the form of a
function G−1 of the combination (p − A(ˆr)) with a gauge potential A(ˆr), i.e.

then we have

ˆQ(r, ˆp) = G−1(p − A(i∂p))

Q(r, p) = G−1(p − A(r)) + O([∂iAj]2)

(22)

(23)

Here O([∂iAj]2) does not contain terms independent of the derivatives of A and the terms linear in those
derivatives, i.e.
In certain particular cases the restrictions on the term
O(([∂iAj]2) may be more strong, or it may even vanish at all [52]. In particular, from Sect. 4 (Eqs. (1.23)-
(1.27)) of [52] it follows, that O([∂iAj]2) vanishes for the case of Wilson fermions with the Green function G
given by Eqs. (2) and (3).

it is higher order in derivatives.

Notice, that the star product entering Eq. (21) is widely used in deformation quantisation [52, 50] and

also in some other applications (see, for example, [53] and references therein).

4. Linear response of electric current to the strength of external gauge ﬁeld.

Let us apply the gradient expansion to the Wigner transform of the Green function. For this we expand

exponent in powers of its arguments in Eq. (21). This gives

˜G(R, p) = ˜G(0)(R, p) + ˜G(1)(R, p) + ...

(24)

˜G(1) = −

˜G(0)

∂h ˜G(0)i−1

∂pj

˜G(0)Aij(R)

Here ˜G(0)(R, p) is deﬁned as the Green function with the ﬁeld strength Aij = ∂iAj − ∂jAi neglected. It is
given by

˜G(0)(R, p) = G(p − A(R))

(25)

6

Next, suppose, that we modiﬁed the external gauge ﬁeld as A → A + δA. The response to this extra
contribution to gauge potential gives electric current. Let us calculate this response basing on the description
of the system given by Eq. (13):

δ log Z = −

(26)

In Appendix B we discuss the Weyl symbol Q(r, p) of the operator ˆQ entering Eq. (21). Notice, that 2p
and P enter the expression inside ˆQ in a symmetric way. This allows to use Eq. (98). The form of Eq. (26)
demonstrates, that the above expression for the electric current may also be written through the function
Q:

As a result of the above mentioned manipulations we come to the following simple expression for the elec-

(28)

Here by |V| we denote the volume of the unit cell understood as the ratio of the total volume of the system to
the number of lattice points at which the ﬁeld Ψ is deﬁned. For the ordinary hypercubic lattice the product
of the two volumes is obviously equal to (2π)D. One might think, that for the lattices of more complicated
symmetry the product of the momentum space volume and the deﬁned above volume of the lattice cell may
diﬀer from this expression. Nevertheless, this is not so, and in general case the given product is always equal
to (2π)D exactly. In general case of an arbitrary crystal the direct proof is rather complicated. However,
the result for the product of the two volumes may be found from the simple ﬁeld theoretical correspondence:
the limit of the microscopic model described by the eﬀective low energy theory should correspond to the
product of the two volumes equal to (2π)D. Notice, that the construction of the unit cell in the original
lattice should be performed with care. One has to count only those sites of the original crystal lattice, at
which the dynamical variables of the model described by Eq. (11) are incident.

Let us apply the gradient expansion to Eq. (28). It results in the following expression for the electric

current:

jk(R) = j(0)k(R) + j(1)k(R) + ...

j(0)k(R) = Z dDp

Notice, that the second row of this expression represents the topological invariant as long as we deal with
the system with regular Green functions, which do not have poles or zeros, i.e. this expression is unchanged
while we are continuously deforming the Green function. We will not need this expression below since it
does not contain the linear response to the external ﬁeld strength.

In the 3 + 1 D systems the contribution to this current originated from ˜G(1) is given by

j(1)k(R) =

(30)

(31)

(32)

In the linear response theory we should substitute A = 0 into the expression for Ml. Therefore, in Eq.
it is robust to any variations of

(32) we substitute G instead of ˜G(0). Ml is the topological invariant, i.e.
the Green function ˜G as long as the singularities are not encountered (for the proof see Appendix B).

Although Eq. (30) was derived for the case of compact momentum space, the non - compact case may
always be obtained as a limit of the compact case, when a certain parameter of the theory tends to inﬁnity.
Therefore, in Eq. (30) the integration may be over compact or over non - compact space depending on the
type of the given system. In particular, we will encounter in the upcoming sections the non - interacting
condensed matter systems with the Green functions of the form G−1 = iω − ˆH, where ω ∈ R is the imaginary
frequency while ˆH is the Hamiltonian. Momentum space of such a system is non - compact and has the
form of R ⊗ Ω, where Ω is the compact Brillouin zone. The linear response of electric current to external
electromagnetic ﬁeld is still given in such systems by Eq. (30). The derivation is analogous to the one we
gave above for the case of compact momentum space.

In this section we give the derivation of the well - known expression for the Hall current in the gapped system
through the topological invariant in momentum space. For the references to the other derivations see, for
example, [9].

Let us consider the 2 + 1 D model with the gapped fermions and the Green function G(p) that depends
on the three - vector p = (p1, p2, p3) of Euclidean momentum. In order to obtain expression for the Hall
current let us introduce into Eq. (34) the external electric ﬁeld E = (E1, E2) as A3k = −iEk (the third
component of vector corresponds to imaginary time). This results in the following expression for the Hall
current

jk
Hall =

˜N3 ǫkiEi,

(35)

where the topological invariant (denoted by ˜N3 according to the classiﬁcation of [9]) is to be calculated for
the original system with vanishing background gauge ﬁeld:

˜N3 = −

1

24π2 Tr Z G−1dG ∧ dG−1 ∧ dG

(36)

Eq. (36) deﬁnes the topological invariant (this is proved in Appendix B). Its appearance explains the quan-
tization of Hall conductance. In Appendix C we demonstrate how to calculate the invariant ˜N3 entering Eq.

8

(35) for the models with 2 × 2 Green functions, and give the example of the model, where the corresponding
value is nonzero. (For the other examples of such models see [9].) In the considered example the Green
function has the form G−1 = iω − H(p), where the Hamiltonian is

H = sin p1 σ2 − sin p2 σ1 − (m + Xi=1,2

(1 − cos pi)) σ3

(37)

For m ∈ (−2, 0) we have ˜N3 = 1 while ˜N3 = −1 for m ∈ (−4, −2) and ˜N3 = 0 for m ∈ (−∞, −4) ∪ (0, ∞).
Let us consider brieﬂy the above mentioned system with the Hamiltonian Eq. (37) in the presence of
boundary.
It gives rise to the potential step of electric potential and the step in m, which becomes the
function of R. Say, if the boundary is directed along the x axis, the potential step results in the extra
electric ﬁeld directed towards the interior of the sample

where ∆φ is the jump of electric potential. We may suppose, that

E2 = ∆φδ(y),

m = m(0) ∈ (−2, 0),
m = m(−) ∈ (0, ∞),

y > 0

y < 0

(38)

(39)

Then at y > 0 we deal with the AQHE system with ˜N3 = 1 while at y < 0 there is the ordinary insulator with
˜N3 = 0. The step in m(R) is important for the demonstration of the appearance of massless edge states.
Namely, at m(R) = 0 the Green function ˜G(0) has the pole, which corresponds to the massless excitation.
Such excitations have deﬁnite chirality, and in general case their number is proportional to the jump of the
topological invariant ˜N3 across the boundary (if we substitute into the expression for ˜N3 the R - dependent
function m). For the derivation of this index theorem the reader is advised to consult chapter 22 of [9]. The
similar derivation for the 3 + 1 D case will be given in Sect. 8.

6. Topological invariant ˜N3 and Berry curvature

In this section we demonstrate how the topological invariant ˜N3 is expressed through Berry curvature in
the 2 + 1 D models. This correspondence works for the Green function of the non - interacting model that
has the form

(40)
with the hermitian hamiltonian ˆH. In the presence of interactions, when the Green function receives a more
complicated form this correspondence looses its sense. (This is the advantage of the formalism, that utilizes
the Green functions.) Nevertheless, at the present moment the approach to the description of QHE based
on Berry curvature is more popular. Therefore, we feel this instructive to derive it from our expressions.

G−1 = iω − ˆH

Thus, we start from

and substitute into it

˜N3 =

1

24π2 Tr Z GdG−1 ∧ dG ∧ dG−1

G−1 = iω −Xn

En(~p)|n, ~pihn, ~p|

(41)

(42)

Here En(p) is the n - th eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian depending on to the lattice momentum ~p = (p1, p2).
The corresponding eigenvector of the Hamiltonian is denoted by |n, ~pi. We have:

˜N3 =

iǫij

8π2 Xnk

Z dω d2p hn, ~p|∂i ˆH(~p)|k, ~pihk, ~p|∂j ˆH(~p)|n, ~pi

(iω − En(~p))2(iω − Ek(~p))

(43)

Integral over the imaginary frequency ω may be taken as a residue at the negative value of Ek, and gives

˜N3 =

iǫij

Z d2p hn, ~p|∂i ˆH(~p)|k, ~pihk, ~p|∂j ˆH(~p)|n, ~pi

θ(−Ek(~p))

(44)

This expression is the starting point of [22], where the expression for the Hall conductivity through the Berry
curvature has been derived for the ﬁrst time. After some algebra we arrive at

˜N3 =

iǫij

2π Xk

Z d2p ∂ihk, ~p|∂j|k, ~piθ(−Ek(~p))

7. AQHE in the 3 + 1D systems

Now let us turn to the 3 + 1D systems. Similar to the two - dimensional models the Hall current is given

by

Notice, that in the case of the non - interacting condensed matter system with the Green function
G−1 = iω − ˆH(p) expressed through the Hamiltonian ˆH we may derive (similar to the above considered case
of the 2 + 1 D system) the representation of the components of topological invariant M′
l with l 6= 4 through
the Berry curvature given by Eqs. (46), (48):

7.2. The case of 2 × 2 Green functions

Let us demonstrate how M′
the Green function has the form

l may be calculated. Let us consider ﬁrst (as in Appendix C) the case, when

G−1(p) = iσ3(cid:16)Xk

σkgk(p) − ig4(p)(cid:17)

(52)

Now we have p = (p1, p2, p3, p4), and p4 is to be identiﬁed with the imaginary frequency. We denote ˆgk = gk
g ,

g = qPk=1,2,3,4 g2

k, and introduce the parametrization

ˆg4 = sin α,

ˆga = ka cos α

(53)

10

where a = 1, 2, 3 while Pa=1,2,3 k2

of momentum space p ∈ ∂M. This gives

a = 1, and α ∈ [−π/2, π/2]. We suppose, that ˆg4(p) = 0 on the boundary

is the integer number, the corresponding integral is along the inﬁnitely small surface Σ, which is wrapped
around the line yj(s) near to the given point of this line.

7.3. The case of 4 × 4 Green functions

Let us consider the more complicated systems with the Green function of the form

G (p) = (cid:16)Xk

γkgk(p) + γ5g5(p) + γ3γ5b(p)(cid:17)−1

(57)

where γk are Euclidean Dirac matrices while gk(p), b(p) are the real - valued functions, k = 1, 2, 3, 4. We
deﬁne γ5 in chiral representation as diag(1, 1, −1, −1). Let us represent G−1 as follows:

G−1(p) = eαγ 3γ 5(cid:16)γ1g1(p) + γ2g2(p) + γ4g4(p) + γ3qg2

3(p) + g2

5(p) + γ3γ5b(p)(cid:17)e−αγ 3γ 5

where

α = −

1
2

arctg

g5
g3

(58)

(59)

Let us assume, that g3 never equals to zero, and that the Green function does not have poles. Then since
M′

l is the topological invariant, we may deform continuously the Green function to the form

G(p) = (cid:16)γ1g1(p) + γ2g2(p) + γ4g4(p) + γ3qg2

3(p) + g2

5(p) + γ3γ5b(p)(cid:17)−1

Under this deformation M′

l remains invariant if on the boundary of momentum space

This follows from Appendix B. This condition is fulﬁlled if on ∂M

Tr(cid:0)[δG−1]G]dG−1 ∧ dG(cid:1) = 0

Now M′

l is equal to

Tr(cid:0)γAGdG−1 ∧ dG(cid:1) = 0, A = 3, 5

M′

l = M′

l,+ + M′

l,−

(60)

where M′

l,± is to be calculated using the 2 × 2 Green functions

± (p) = σ1g1(p) + σ2g2(p) + σ3g4(p) ± i(cid:16)qg2
G−1

3(p) + g2

5(p) ± b(p)(cid:17)

(64)

Thus the problem is reduced to the one considered above. It is worth mentioning, that the given way of
calculation may easily be extended to the Green functions of some other forms.
In particular, the same

expression for the topological invariant is valid for G (p) = (cid:16)Pk γkgk(p) − ig5(p) + γ3γ5b(p)(cid:17)−1

.

8. Bulk - boundary correspondence

We are able to use the Wigner transform of the Green function in order to describe the bulk - boundary
correspondence (for the description of the method see Chapter 22 in [9] and [7]). Let us suppose, that in
the given solid (R is inside the bulk) there are no poles of ˜G(0)(R, p) as functions of p. Let us also suppose,
that a surface divides space into the two parts with diﬀerent values of M′
l. For simplicity let us consider the
situation, when momentum space has the form of torus, M′
l is nonzero for l = 1 only, while this surface is
situated in the xy plane, and ˜G(0)(R, p) depends on R3 = z only. The set z, pk with k 6= l constitues four
- dimensional space. The following integrals over the two hyper - surfaces in this space with z = ±ǫ (with
small ǫ) may be deformed safely to a closed hyper - surface:

N3(p1) =

1

3! 4π2 ǫijkl Z dp2dp3dp4 Trh ˜G(0) ∂( ˜G(0))−1

∂pi

∂ ˜G(0)
∂pj

∂( ˜G(0))−1

∂pk

i

(65)

If the resulting integral is nonzero, then inside it there are N3 topologically protected poles of ˜G(0), which
correspond to massless states concentrated in a small vicinity of boundary. There is also the question about
the relation of these poles of ˜G(0) with the gapless excitations in the eﬀective theory that describes fermions
on the boundary. Such a relation was discussed in Chapter 22 of [9] and in [7]). The output of this study is
that the chirality of those 1 + 1 dimensional fermions is given by the sign of N3. This chirality is encoded in
the quantity

N1(C, p1) =

1

2πi Xz

Z dp3

2π ZC

Tr ˜G(R, p)d ˜G−1(R, p)

(66)

Here the contour is in the plane (p4, p2), while the sum is over all possible (discrete) values of z. Again, we
use Eq. (21) and expand exponent in powers of its arguments, which gives

˜G(R, p) = ˜G(0)(R, p) + ˜G(1)(R, p) + ...

˜G(1) =

˜G(0)

˜G(0)

˜G(0)

Here ˜G(0)(R, p) is given by Eq. (25). Let us substitute Eq. (67) into Eq. (66). Assuming, that ˜G is slowly

varying we substitute Pz by R ∞

−∞ dz. This way we come to the integral of the form
3! 4π2 Z Trh ˜G(0)d( ˜G(0))−1 ∧ d ˜G(0) ∧ d( ˜G(0))−1i

1

N3(p1) =

(68)

Here the integral is over the surface C⊗S1⊗R1, where S1 corresponds to the values of p3 while R1 corresponds
to the values of z. Since there are no poles of ˜G inside the bulk we are able to deform this hyper - surface
into the form of two hyper - planes (p2, p3, p4) placed at z = ±ǫ, which gives the value of N3(p1).

In turn, for the case of noninteracting system with G = iω − ˆH we have

G = iω −Xn

En(p1, p2)|n, p1, p2ihn, p1, p2|

12

where the sum is over the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian enumerated by index n and the values of conserved
momenta p1, p2. Let us denote Gn = iω − En(p1, p2). Then Eq. (66) may be represented as

N1(C, p1) =

1

2πi Xn

ZC

˜Gnd ˜G−1
n

(69)

This expression gives the sum of the chiralities of the states enumerated by n. Only those states which are
localized at the boundary may have gapless excitations because according to our supposition in the bulk of
the system there are no poles of the Green function. Thus we come to conclusion, that N3(p1) enumerates
the gapless boundary modes, and its sign corresponds to their chirality. Notice, that the similar conclusion
is given in the lattice theory of domain - wall fermions (see, for example, [14]).

Now let us describe the dependence of this pattern on p1. N3(p1) cannot depend on p1 because we
assumed, that there are no poles in the bulk. Therefore, we come to the conclusion, that the topologically
protected gapless surface states exist, which form lines in momentum space (the dispersion does not depend
on p1). The number of such Fermi lines is equal to the jump of N3 accross the boundary and is related to the
jump of M′
l for arbitrary l is
straightforward. The generalization to the case of the Brillouin zones of arbitrary form is more involved and
will be omitted here. It is worth mentioning, that in section 10 we will see, that for the Weyl semimetals,
when there are Fermi points in the bulk, the described above boundary Fermi lines become the Fermi arcs
connecting the bulk Fermi points.

1 = R dp1N3(p1). The generalization of this consideration to the values of M′

9. AQHE in the toy models of 3 + 1 D insulators

9.1. Model I1

In this section we will consider the two particular examples of the 3 + 1D insulators, for which the
l may be calculated using the technique developed above. Let us start from the

topological invariant M′
model with the Hamiltonian

H = sin p1 σ2 − sin p2 σ1 − (m(0) − γ cos p3 + Xi=1,2

(1 − cos pi)) σ3

(70)

For γ < 1, and m(0) ∈ (−2 + γ, −γ) we deal with the insulator. Here we use the system of units, in which
the lattice spacing a is equal to unity. Therefore, lattice momentum pk is dimensionless. The 2 × 2 Green
function has the form G−1 = iω − H(p) while the Brillouin zone has the form of torus. We will be using the
following expression for the Green function:

− iσ3G−1 = sin p1 σ1 + sin p2 σ2 + ω σ3 − i(m(0) − γcos p3 + Xi=1,2

(1 − cos pi))

(71)

We have

and

ˆg4(p) =

(m(0) − γcos p3 +Pi=1,2(1 − cos pi))

q(m(0) − γcos p3 + Pi=1,2(1 − cos pi))2 + sin2 p1 + sin2 p2 + ω2

ˆgi(p) = 0 (k = 1, 2, 3), p = (0, 0, p3, 0),

ˆg4(p) = 0, p ∈ ∂M (ω → ±∞)
ˆg4(p) = −1,
ˆg4(p) = 1,
ˆg4(p) = 1,
ˆg4(p) = 1,

ˆgi(p) = 0
ˆgi(p) = 0
ˆgi(p) = 0

(k = 1, 2, 3), p = (0, π, p3, 0),
(k = 1, 2, 3), p = (π, 0, p3, 0),
(k = 1, 2, 3), p = (π, π, p3, 0),

This follows from Appendix B. The interactions, that keep Eq. (75) cannot aﬀect the value of the AQHE

with

g3(p) = g(0)

3 +sin p3,

This system is able to describe qualitatively a certain class of topological insulators [57]. Depending on
the identiﬁcation of matrices σa entering matrices γa of Eq. (57) with the operators of spin, isospin, or
Bogolyubov spin, Eq.
(76) may describe diﬀerent classes of topological insulators, including those with
broken time reversal symmetry and/or broken particle - hole symmetry. We assume, that the parameters

(Here a is the lattice spacing.)

As it was mentioned above, the nontrivial topology in the bulk of the topological insulators, which
possess the AQHE, manifests itself in the appearance of the surface Fermi lines. Let us suppose, that the
given insulator sample has the cubic form. Then the Fermi lines appear on the boundaries that belong to
p3 ∈ (−π, π). On the boundaries
planes (xz) and (yz). Those Fermi lines are placed at p = (0, 0, p3, 0),
that belong to (xy) plane there is the Fermi point at p1 = p2 = 0. This pattern may easily be derived using
the Wigner transform of the Green function ˜G(0)(R, p), which depends on coordinate denending parameter
b(R). It is assumed, that this parameter vanishes when we approach boundary.

10. AQHE in the toy models of 3 + 1 D Weyl semimetals

10.1. Model W1

Let us extend the above consideration to the models of Weyl semimetals. First, let us start from the toy

model of Weyl semimetal with the Green function G−1 = iω − H(p) and the Hamiltonian of the form

H = sin p1 σ2 − sin p2 σ1 − (m(0) − cos p3 + Xi=1,2

(1 − cos pi)) σ3

(81)

This is the modiﬁcation of the model I1 considered above. For m(0) ∈ (0, 1) the system contains the two
Fermi points

K± = (0, 0, ±β, 0),

β = arccos m(0)

(82)

Although the Green function contains singularities, the integral in Eq. (50) is convergent as we will see
below. To be explicit, we ﬁrst integrate over the momentum space with the small vicinities of the poles
subtracted, and then consider the limit, when those vicinities are inﬁnitely small. We will be using the
following expression for the Green function:

− iσ3G−1 = sin p1 σ1 + sin p2 σ2 + ω σ3 − i(m(0) − cos p3 + Xi=1,2

(1 − cos pi))

(83)

We have

and

ˆg4(p) =

(m(0) − cos p3 +Pi=1,2(1 − cos pi))

q(m(0) − cos p3 +Pi=1,2(1 − cos pi))2 + sin2 p1 + sin2 p2 + ω2

ˆgi(p) = 0

(k = 1, 2, 3), p = (0, 0, p3, 0),

p3 ∈ (−β, β)

ˆg4(p) = 0, p ∈ ∂M
ˆg4(p) = −1,
ˆg4(p) = 1,
ˆg4(p) = 1,
ˆg4(p) = 1,
ˆg4(p) = 1,

ˆgi(p) = 0 (k = 1, 2, 3), p = (0, 0, p3, 0),
ˆgi(p) = 0 (k = 1, 2, 3), p = (0, π, p3, 0),
ˆgi(p) = 0 (k = 1, 2, 3), p = (π, 0, p3, 0),
ˆgi(p) = 0 (k = 1, 2, 3), p = (π, π, p3, 0),

p3 ∈ (−π, −β) ∪ (β, π)
p3 ∈ (−π, −π)

From the above expression it is obvious, that the contributions of all zeros of gk (k = 1, 2, 3) listed in Eq.
(84) are important. Nevertheless, our result coincides with the one of the naive low energy eﬀective ﬁeld
theory [40]. The coeﬃcient in Eq. (90) has also been calculated using the technique of Berry curvature in
[54].

It is also worth mentioning, that in the particular case of the Weyl semimetal, when the Green function
contains poles Eq. (50) is not the topological invariant. It still gives the AQHE current, though. But we
should remember, that turning on interactions we change the value of M′
k, thus leading to the continuous
renormalization of the value β that marks the position of the Fermi point. Notice, that even in the presence
of a pole Eq. (50) remains invariant under those continuous changes of the Green function, which do not
alter the positions of the Fermi points and for which

Z Tr(cid:0){[δG−1]G]}dG−1 ∧ dG(cid:1) = 0

where the integral is taken along the boundary of the small vicinity of the pole. This follows immediately
from the derivation of Appendix B.

It is worth mentioning, that the ﬁrst order in the derivative expansion does not allow to calculate the
derivative of electric current. That’s why we cannot simply diﬀerentiate Eq. (90) in order to calculate such
a derivative. Both dependence of β on R and the second order in the derivative expansion should be applied
to calculate ∂j (that should vanish in equilibrium due to the gauge invariance).

10.2. Model W2

Let us consider the more complicated model of Weyl semimetal, which represents the deformation of the
insulator model I2 with the Green function of the form of Eq. (57). We imply, that the functions ga and
b entering Eq. (57) have the form of Eq. (76). But we assume diﬀerent relations between the parameters
of the model. Now we require, that the parameters entering the expression for the Green function satisfy
3 > pb2 − (m(0))2 > g(0)
g(0)

3 − 1 > 0 while

q(g(0)

3 + sin β±)2 + (m(0))2 = b

3 + sin p3)2 + (m(0))2 < b,

q(g(0)
3 + sin p3)2 + (m(0))2 > b,

q(g(0)

p3 ∈ (β−, β+),

p3 ∈ (−π, β−) ∪ (β+, π)

The given model contains the two Fermi points

K± = (0, 0, β±, 0)

(87)

Instead of Eq. (78) we have

(k = 1, 2, 3), p = (0, 0, p3, 0),

ˆg′
4(p) = 0, p ∈ ∂M (ω → ±∞)

ˆg′
i(p) = 0 (k = 1, 2, 3), p = (0, π, p3, 0),
ˆg′
i(p) = 0 (k = 1, 2, 3), p = (π, 0, p3, 0),
ˆg′
i(p) = 0 (k = 1, 2, 3), p = (π, π, p3, 0),

p3 ∈ (β−, β+)

p3 ∈ (−π, β−) ∪ (β+, π)
p3 ∈ (−π, π)
p3 ∈ (−π, π)
p3 ∈ (−π, π)

(88)

In Eq. (50) we represent Ml as an integral over the component pl of the topological invariant of the 2 + 1
D system, which depends on pl as on parameter. In the presence of the pole the integral is ill - deﬁned at the
positions of poles and requires regularization. We consider the integration over pl with the small vicinities
of the l - th coordinates of the poles subtracted. For each value of pl, which does not belong to this interval
the integral over the other components of p is well - deﬁned. Therefore, we are able to use Eq. (63) if Eq.
(62) is fulﬁlled at ω → ±∞ (which may be checked easily). The values of M′
j,± are given by the integrals

16

in Eq. (55) over dpj, where as it was explained above, the small vicinities (p(a)
j + ǫ) of the j - th
coordinates of the poles p(a), a = 1, 2 are subtracted. At the end of the calculations we take the limit ǫ → 0.

In order to illustrate how the bulk - boundary correspondence works here, let us consider what happens to
the Fermi points when we aproach the boundary of the sample. This approaching is described by the Wigner
transform of the Green function ˜G(0)(R, p), which depends on the coordinates R through the dependence
of parameter b on R. We assume, that out of the bulk of the semimetal b(R) = 0, and this parameter is
increased inside the semimetal. In this situation the derivative expansion in the presence of external electric
ﬁeld becomes more complicated near boundary than inside of the bulk. However, we do not discuss here the
corresponding expression for the electric current. As for the Fermi points, one can easily see, that the two
Fermi points K± approach each other, and ﬁnally annihilate while we are aproaching boundary. Since this
process occurs in the small vicinity of the boundary, it results in the appearance of surface states of zero
energy that connect the two bulk Fermi points. These surface states are the Fermi arcs.

11. The absence of bulk chiral magnetic current

The conventional expression for the CME current reads jk

4π2 ǫijk4 Aij , where µ5 is the chiral
chemical potential. One may expect, that such an expression will follow from Eq. (30): we need to substitute
A = 0 into Eq. (32) in the linear response approximation. Then one might expect that M4 = µ5 for the
system of a single massless Dirac fermion and a similar expression may take place for the other systems with
gapless fermions (or, nearly gapless fermions).

CME = µ5

Let us consider the situation, when vector gauge ﬁeld Ak(R) has the nonzero components with k = 1, 2, 3
that do not depend on imaginary time. There may exist many diﬀerent deﬁnitions of µ5. Possibly, the most
straightforward way is to consider the following expression for the fermion Green function:

G (p) = (cid:16)Xk

γkgk(p) + iγ4γ5µ5 − im(p)(cid:17)−1

(91)

In the limit of vanishing chiral chemical potential it is reduced to the form of Eq. (2), where γk are Euclidean
Dirac matrices while gk(p) and m(p) are the real - valued functions, k = 1, 2, 3, 4. We deﬁne γ5 in chiral
representation as diag(1, 1, −1, −1). We may substitute G of Eq. (91) into Eq. (30) instead of ˜G(R, p) while
dealing with the linear response to the external magnetic ﬁeld.

We will apply our methodology to the investigation of the theory with compact Brillouin zone. We imply,
that momentum space can be represented as R1 ⊗ Ω or S1 ⊗ Ω, where Ω is the compact 3D Brillouin zone.
First, we assume, that the Green functions do not have zeros or poles, which means, that the fermions
are gapped (massive). However, at the end of the calculations the limit of vanishing mass may always be
considered. We need, though, that the inclusion of the chiral chemical potential does not produce poles in
the Green function. For the Green function of the form of Eq. (91) this may be proved as follows. The poles
of the Green function appear as the solutions of the following equation

4(p) +(cid:16)µ5 ±qg2
g2

1(p) + g2

2(p) + g2

3(p)(cid:17)2

+ m2(p) = 0

(92)

One can easily see, that if functions m(p) and g4(p) never vanish simultaneously (which is the common
case if the original Green function Eq. (2) does not have poles), then the inclusion of the chiral chemical
potential in the form of Eq. (91) cannot lead to the appearance of the poles5 of G. We need this property

5This is in contrast to the case of the ordinary chemical potential, in which the poles of the Green function may appear if

chemical potential exceeds the gap.

17

to be obeyed by the inclusion of the chiral chemical potential, and we do not need the particular form of
Eq. (91). To illustrate this general pattern let us recall, however, the form of the Green function for the free
lattice Wilson fermions:

gk(p) = sin pk (k = 1, 2, 3, 4), m(p) = m(0) + Xa=1,2,3,4

(1 − cos pa)

(93)

One can see, that for nonzero bare mass parameter m(0) the values of g4(p) and m(p) do not vanish at the
same value of p. The counter - examples are considered here as marginal.

Let us notice that M4 is topological invariant, i.e.

it is robust to any variations of the Green function
as long as the singularities are not encountered (for the proof see Appendix B). The introduction of chiral
chemical potential is the particular case of such a variation. Actually, for the Green function of the form of
Eq. (2) M4 = 0. However, we do not need here the particular form of the Green function. We only need
that momentum space can be represented as R1 ⊗ Ω, or S1 ⊗ Ω, where Ω is the compact 3D Brillouin zone.
The absence of the dependence on chiral chemical potential means, that there is no CME as long as we
deal with compact Brillouin zone and regular Green function. The ﬁnite value of chiral chemical potential
does not change the situation because as we mentioned above such a ﬁnite value cannot provide the Green
function of the form of Eq. (2) with the pole (at least, when the form of G is not marginal).

The above consideration referred to gapped fermions. However, the limit of vanishing gap does not
change this conclusion. Moreover, we may start from the system with the gapped fermions from the very
beginning. Then, the introduction of nonzero chiral chemical potential eliminates the pole and again, the
independence of current of Eq. (30) on the value of chiral chemical potential gives rise to the absence of the
CME.

12. Conclusions and discussion

In the present paper we demonstrated how momentum space topology may be applied to the analysis
of the anomalous transport related to the non - dissipative electric current. We concentrate on the linear
response of electric current to external electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The response to external electric ﬁeld
leads to the appearance of the quantum Hall eﬀect while the response to external magnetic ﬁeld was associated
in certain publications with the equilibrium chiral magnetic eﬀect.

We show that the corresponding currents are proportional to the momentum space topological invariants.
Our methodology is based on the derivative expansion applied to the Wigner transform of the two - point
Green functions. We introduce the slowly varying external gauge ﬁeld directly to the momentum space
formulation of the lattice models of solid state physics and of the lattice regularization of continuous QFT.
In this representation the external gauge ﬁeld appears as a pseudo - diﬀerential operator A(i∂p). This way
of the incorporation of the external ﬁeld to the theory is not useful for its numerical simulations, but is
convenient for the analytical derivations. As it was mentioned above, the response of electric current to
external ﬁeld strength is expressed through the topological invariant in momentum space. This relation
allows to describe the anomalous quantum Hall eﬀect both in the 2 + 1 D and in the 3 + 1 D systems. First
of all we reproduce the conventional expression for the 2 + 1 D Hall conductivity through the topological
invariant ˜N3 (in the classiﬁcation of [9]). It is demonstrated, how this invariant may be calculated in practise
in the systems with the 2 × 2 Green function. Besides, we reproduce the conventional expression of the 2 + 1
D Hall conductivity through the integral over Berry curvature [22, 23].

Next, we extend our consideration to the 3 + 1 D models. We describe the way to calculate the corre-
sponding topological invariants for the wide class of systems with 2 × 2 and 4 × 4 Green functions (including
those with the broken time reversal symmetry). This method is illustrated by the consideration of the two
particular toy models of topological insulators. We demonstrate, that the resulting Hall current is pro-
portional to one of the vectors of reciprocal lattice (which was also proposed in [56]). We also show, how
the bulk boundary correspondence may be ivestigated using the Wigner transform of the Green functions.
It is pointed out, that the insulator state, which admits AQHE is accompanied by the appearance of the
topologically protected surface Fermi lines incident at the boundary of the insulator.

Further, we consider the 3 + 1 D Weyl semimetals. The two toy models of Weyl semimetals with the
2 × 2 and 4 × 4 Green functions are investigated in details. The conventional expressions for AQHE currents

18

obtained earlier using the eﬀective low energy ﬁeld theory [37] are reproduced in both cases. Our ﬁndings
here are in line with the recent results on AQHE reported in [47, 54]. We also brieﬂy discuss how the
surface Fermi arcs connecting the bulk Weyl points manifest themselves on the language of the Wigner
transformation of the Green functions.

Our analysis of the equilibrium chiral magnetic eﬀect demonstrates that the corresponding topological
invariant entering the expression for the CME current does not depend on the value of chiral chemical
potential for the systems with compact Brillouin zone and without poles or zeros of the Green function.
Therefore, we conclude, that the lattice regularized quantum ﬁeld theory as well as the gapped solid state
systems do not possess the equilibrium bulk chiral magnetic eﬀect. The same conslusion refers to the
semimetals, which may be considered as the limiting case of the insulators when the gap tends to zero. Such
a limit does not change the independence of the mentioned above topological invariant on chiral chemical
potential. Thus, we conﬁrm the recent numerical results [31, 32, 32, 33, 34], which led to the same conclusion.
To conclude, in all considered cases the proposed methodology reproduces the known results on the
AQHE and CME currents. However, the class of models analysed here is more wide. Unlike the more
popular method, which utilizes Berry curvature, we use the topological invariants composed of the Green
functions [9]. This allows us to investigate the topological contribution to electric current in the interacting
systems, when the Green function does not have the simple form G−1 = iω − ˆH with the Hamiltonian ˆH and
imaginary frequency ω. We relate both AQHE and CME currents to such invariants composed of the Wigner
transform of the Green functions. This representation is unique and allows to describe both bulk AQHE and
the bulk - boundary correspondence. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is the possibility
to describe systematically the anomalous transport in the wide class of models, including those with the
interactions turned on. The proposed method of the calculation of the mentioned topological invariants
may, in principle, be extended to the more complicated systems.

Appendix A. Wigner transformation of the Green function

Let us consider the d+1 = D dimensional lattice model of solid state physics (or the lattice regularization

of the continuum QFT) with the Green function G(p1, p2), which obeys equation

ˆQ(i∂p1, p1)G(p1, p2) = |M|δ(D)(p1 − p2)

(94)

Here ˆQ is Hermitian operator - valued function. Wigner decomposition in momentum space takes the form

˜G(R, p) = Z dDP

Here Q is the Weyl symbol of operator ˆQ, that is the function of real numbers rather than of the operators.
In [51, 52] it is deﬁned as

Q(R, p) = Z dDKdDPeiPRδ(p − P/2 − K) ˆQ(i∂K, K)δ(p + P/2 − K)

(97)

The derivation of Eq. (96) was given, for example, in [52].

The further consideration will be based on the diﬀerent deﬁnition of Weyl symbol. Its equivalence to
that of Eq. (97) follows from the fact that it obeys the same equation Eq. (96). To be explicit, we determine
relation between the function Q(r, p) (of real - valued vectors r and p) and the function ˆQ(ˆr, p) (of the
operators p and ˆr = i∂p) through equation

∂(X/2−Y/2) = ∂X − ∂Y. We may rewrite Eq. (98) as

The given correspondence between operator ˆQ and its symbol Q takes the simple form in certain particular
cases. For example, if ˆQ = (p − A(ˆr))2 = p2 + A2(ˆr) + i(cid:16)∂kAk(ˆr)(cid:17) − 2A(ˆr)p (recall, that ˆr is operator
equal to i∂p), then Q = p2 + A2(r) − 2A(r)p. Besides, if ˆQ has the form

then

ˆQ(ˆr, p) = F (p − A(ˆr))

Q(r, p) = F (p − A(r)) + O([∂iAj]2)

(100)

(101)

Here O([∂iAj]2) may contain the terms with the second power of the derivatives of A and the terms higher
order in derivatives.

In order to prove Eq. (101) let us represent the function F (p−A(ˆr)) = Pn Fi1...in(pi1 −Ai1 (i∂p))...(pin −

Ain (i∂p)) as a series in powers of its arguments (Fi1...in are Hermitian operators that do not depend on p).
Operator ˆQ is Hermitian, therefore, the operator in the ﬁrst row of Eq. (99) should also be Hermitian.

Let us suppose, that Q is linear in the derivative of A. The linear term appears as a product of a

appearance of imaginary unity in the expression for q... as a combination of F..., which means that q... is not
Hermitian. Therefore, we come to the contradiction, which proves the non - appearance of the terms linear
in the derivatives of A in the expression for Q(r, p).

Appendix B. Topological invariant responsible for the linear response of electric current to
external ﬁeld strength

Let us consider the following expression for the coeﬃcient entering the linear response of electric current

to external magnetic ﬁeld:

Ml = −

48π2 ǫijklTr ZM

d4p(cid:16)G∂iG−1(cid:17)(cid:16)G∂jG−1(cid:17)(cid:16)G∂kG−1(cid:17)

(105)

If M has the form of the product R1 ⊗ Ω, where Ω is the compact 3D Brillouin zone, while R1 is the
imaginary frequency line (or if M = S1 ⊗ Ω, which takes place if the time evolution is discretized), then for
l = 4 we may rewrite this quantity as follows:

M4 = −

˜N3(p4) =

d3p(cid:16)G∂iG−1(cid:17)(cid:16)G∂jG−1(cid:17)(cid:16)G∂kG−1(cid:17)

(106)

(107)

Here for the ﬁxed value of p4 we encounter the expression for the topological invariant in the 3D Brillouin
zone. Green function G should be considered here as the function of the 3 arguments p1, p2, p3 while p4 is to
be considered as a parameter.

Notice, that for the Green function of the form of Eq. (2) the value of ˜N3(p4) is equal to zero. One might
naively think, that the deviation of the Green function from the form of Eq. (2) - say, of the form of Eq.
(91) may change the expressions for ˜N3 and M4. Below we will demonstrate, that this does not occur as
long as we deal with the compact Brillouin zone and regular Green functions.

Let us consider arbitrary variation of the Green function: G → G + δG. Then expression for ˜N3 is changed

as follows:

δ ˜N3 = −

3

24π2 Z Tr(cid:0){[δG]dG−1 + Gd[δG−1]} ∧ GdG−1 ∧ GdG−1(cid:1)

24π2 Z Tr(cid:0){[δG−1][dG] + d[δG−1]G} ∧ dG−1 ∧ dG(cid:1)
24π2 Z d Tr(cid:0){[δG−1]G]}dG−1 ∧ dG(cid:1) = 0

3

3

= −

=

=

(108)

That’s why we proved that ˜N3 and M4 are the topological invariants.

In the similar way it may be proved, that Ml is the topological invariant for l 6= 4 if M = R ⊗ Ω, and G
tends to zero suﬃciently fast at ω = p4 → ±∞. Also it may be easily found that for any l the value of Ml
is topological invariant if we deal with any compact momentum space.

Appendix C. Calculation of ˜N3 for the 2 + 1 D systems

In this section we demonstrate how the value of the topological invariant ˜N3 may be calculated. Below

we calculate ˜N3 for the case, when the Green function has the form

G−1(p) = iσ3(cid:16)Xk

σkgk(p) − ig4(p)(cid:17)

where σk are Pauli matrices while gk(p) and g4(p) are the real - valued functions, k = 1, 2, 3. Let us deﬁne

ǫijk Z∂Ω(y)
It is worth mentioning, that this symbol obeys Pl Res (yi) = 0.
the Green function G−1 = iω − H(p), where the Hamiltonian has the form

ˆgidˆgj ∧ dˆgk

Res (y) =

1
8π

(116)

(117)

Let us illustrate the above calculation by the consideration of the particular example of the system with

H = sin p1 σ2 − sin p2 σ1 − (m(0) + Xi=1,2

(1 − cos pi)) σ3

(118)

22

This gives

− iσ3G−1 = sin p1 σ1 + sin p2 σ2 + ω σ3 − i(m(0) + Xi=1,2

(1 − cos pi))

(119)

The boundary of momentum space corresponds to ω = ±∞. We have

ˆg4(p) =

(m(0) +Pi=1,2(1 − cos pi))

q(m(0) +Pi=1,2(1 − cos pi))2 + sin2 p1 + sin2 p2 + ω2

For example, for m(0) ∈ (−2, 0) we have

ˆgi(p) = 0

ˆg4(p) = 0, p ∈ ∂M
ˆg4(p) = −1,
ˆg4(p) = 1,
ˆg4(p) = 1,
ˆg4(p) = 1,

ˆgi(p) = 0
ˆgi(p) = 0
ˆgi(p) = 0

(k = 1, 2, 3), p = (0, 0, 0)

(k = 1, 2, 3), p = (0, π, 0)

(k = 1, 2, 3), p = (π, 0, 0)
(k = 1, 2, 3), p = (π, π, 0)

Therefore, we get immediately

˜N3 =

1
2

−

1
2

(−1) −

1
2

(−1) −

1

= 1

In the similar way ˜N3 = −1 for m(0) ∈ (−4, −2) and ˜N3 = 0 for m(0) ∈ (−∞, −4) ∪ (0, ∞).
