Abstract

We study the generalized Drazin invertibility as well as the Drazin and

ordinary invertibility of an operator matrix MC = (cid:18) A C

0 B (cid:19) acting

on a Banach space X ⊕Y or on a Hilbert space H⊕K. As a consequence
some recent results are extended.

Introduction and Preliminaries

Let X and Y be inﬁnite dimensional Banach spaces. The set of all bounded
linear operators from X to Y will be denoted by L(X , Y). For simplicity, we
write L(X ) for L(X , X ). The set

X ⊕ Y = {(x, y) : x ∈ X , y ∈ Y}

is a vector space with standard addition and multiplication by scalars. Under
the norm

||(x, y)|| = (||x||2 + ||y||2)

1

2

X ⊕ Y becomes a Banach space. If X1 and Y1 are closed subspaces of X

and Y respectively, then we will use sometimes notation (cid:18) X1

Y1 (cid:19) instead of

X1 ⊕ Y1. If A ∈ L(X ), B ∈ L(Y) and C ∈ L(Y, X ) are given, then

(cid:18) A C

0 B (cid:19) : X ⊕ Y → X ⊕ Y

represents a bounded linear operator on X ⊕ Y and it is called upper trian-

gular operator matrix. If A and B are given then we write MC = (cid:18) A C

0 B (cid:19)

in order to emphasize dependence on C.

Let N (N0) denote the set of all positive (non-negative) integers, and let
C denote the set of all complex numbers. Given T ∈ L(X , Y), we denote
by N (T ) and R(T ) the kernel and the range of T . The numbers α(T ) =
dimN (T ) and β(T ) = codimR(T ) are nullity and deﬁciency of T ∈ L(X , Y)
respectively. The set

σ(T ) = {λ ∈ C : T − λ is not invertible}

is the spectrum of T ∈ L(X ). An operator T ∈ L(X ) is bounded below if
there exists some c > 0 such that ckxk ≤ kT xk for every x ∈ X . It is
worth mentioning that the set of bounded below operators and the set of
left invertible operators coincide in the Hilbert space setting. Also, the set
of surjective operators and the set of right invertible operators coincide on
a Hilbert space. Recall that T ∈ L(X ) is nilpotent when T n = 0 for some
n ∈ N, while T ∈ L(X ) is quasinilpotent if T − λ is invertible for all complex
λ 6= 0. The ascent of T ∈ L(X ) is deﬁned as asc(T ) = inf{n ∈ N0 : N (T n) =
N (T n+1)}, and descent of T is deﬁned as dsc(T ) = inf{n ∈ N0 : R(T n) =
R(T n+1)}, where the inﬁmum over the empty set is taken to be inﬁnity. If
K ⊂ C, acc K is the set of accumulation points of K.

If M is a subspace of X such that T (M ) ⊂ M , T ∈ L(X ), it is said that
M is T -invariant. We deﬁne TM : M → M as TM x = T x, x ∈ M . If M
and N are two closed T -invariant subspaces of X such that X = M ⊕ N ,
we say that T is completely reduced by the pair (M, N ) and it is denoted by
(M, N ) ∈ Red(T ). In this case we write T = TM ⊕ TN and say that T is a
direct sum of TM and TN .

An operator T ∈ L(X ) is said to be Drazin invertible, if there exists

S ∈ L(X ) and some k ∈ N such that

T S = ST, ST S = S, T kST = T k.

It is a classical result that necessary and suﬃcient for T ∈ L(X ) to be Drazin
invertible is that T = T1 ⊕ T2 where T1 is invertible and T2 is nilpotent; see
[10, 11]. The Drazin spectrum of T is deﬁned as

σD(T ) = {λ ∈ C : T − λ is not Drazin invertible}

and it is compact [3, Proposition 2.5]. An operator T ∈ L(X ) is left Drazin
invertible if asc(T ) < ∞ and if R(T asc(T )+1) is closed and T ∈ L(X ) is right
Drazin invertible if dsc(T ) < ∞ and if R(T dsc(T )) is closed.

J. Koliha extended the concept of Drazin invertibility [14]. An operator
T ∈ L(X ) is said to be generalized Drazin invertible, if there exists S ∈ L(X )

2

such that

T S = ST, ST S = S, T ST − T is quasinilpotent.

According to [14, Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 7.1], T ∈ L(X ) is generalized
Drazin invertible if and only if 0 6∈ acc σ(T ), and it is exactly when T =
T1 ⊕ T2 with T1 invertible and T2 quasinilpotent. Naturally, the set

σgD(T ) = {λ ∈ C : T − λ is not generalized Drazin invertible}

is the generalized Drazin spectrum of T .

We also recall deﬁnitions of the following spectra of T ∈ L(X ):

the point spectrum: σp(T ) = {λ ∈ C : T − λ is not injective},
the defect spectrum: σd(T ) = {λ ∈ C : R(T − λ) 6= X },
the approximate point spectrum: σap(T ) = {λ ∈ C : T −λ is not bounded below},
the surjective spectrum: σsu(T ) = {λ ∈ C : T − λ is not surjective},
the left spectrum: σl(T ) = {λ ∈ C : T − λ is not left invertible},
the right spectrum: σr(T ) = {λ ∈ C : T − λ is not right invertible}.

Let M and L be two closed linear subspaces of X and set

δ(M, L) = sup{dist(u, L) : u ∈ M, kuk = 1},

in the case that M 6= {0}, otherwise we deﬁne δ({0}, L) = 0 for any subspace
L. The gap between M and L is deﬁned by

ˆδ(M, L) = max{δ(M, L), δ(L, M )}.

It is known that [15, corollary 10.10]

ˆδ(M, L) < 1 =⇒ dimM = dimL.

(1.1)

An operator T ∈ L(X ) is semi-regular if R(T ) is closed and if one of the

following equivalent statements holds:
(i) N (T ) ⊂ R(T m) for each m ∈ N;
(ii) N (T n) ⊂ R(T ) for each n ∈ N.
It is clear that left and right invertible operators are semi-regular. V. M¨uller
shows ([15, Corollary 12.4]) that if T ∈ L(X ), then T is semi-regular and
0 6∈ acc σ(T ) imply that T is invertible. In particular,

T is left invertible and 0 6∈ acc σ(T ) =⇒ T is invertible,
T is right invertible and 0 6∈ acc σ(T ) =⇒ T is invertible.

An operator T ∈ L(X ) is said to admit a generalized Kato decomposition,
abbreviated as GKD, if there exists a pair (M, N ) ∈ Red(T ) such that TM
is semi-regular and TN is quasinilpotent. A relevant case is obtained if we
assume that TN is nilpotent. In this case T is said to be of Kato type.

The invertibility, Drazin invertibility and generalized Drazin invertibility
of upper triangular operator matrices have been studied by many authors,
see for example [12, 13, 7, 18, 5, 8, 9, 19, 17]. In this article we study pri-
marily the generalized Drazin invertibility but also the Drazin and ordinary
invertibility of operator matrices by using the technique that involves the
gap theory; see the auxiliary results: (1.1), (1.2), (1.3), Lemma 2.1, Lemma
2.3. Let A ∈ L(H) and B ∈ L(K), where H and K are separable Hilbert
spaces, and consider the following conditions:
(i) A = A1 ⊕ A2, A1 is bounded below and A2 is quasinilpotent;
(ii) B = B1 ⊕ B2, B1 is surjective and B2 is quasinilpotent;
(iii) There exists a constant δ > 0 such that β(A − λ) = α(B − λ) for every
λ ∈ C such that 0 < |λ| < δ.

Our main result stands that if the conditions (i)-(iii) are satisﬁed then there
exists C ∈ L(K, H) such that MC is generalized Drazin invertible. The
converse is also true under the assumption that A and B admit a GKD.
Moreover, we obtain the corresponding results concerning the Drazin in-
vertibility of operator matrices. Further, let A ∈ L(X ) and B ∈ L(Y) where
X and Y are Banach spaces. It is also shown that if 0 is not an accumula-
tion point of the defect spectrum of A or of the point spectrum of B and if

the operator matrix MC = (cid:18) A C

0 B (cid:19) is invertible (resp. Drazin invertible,

generalized Drazin invertible) for some C ∈ L(Y, X ) then A and B are both
invertible (resp. Drazin invertible, generalized Drazin invertible). What is
more, we give several corollaries that improve some recent results.

2 Results

From now on X and Y will denote Banach spaces, while H and K will denote
separable Hilbert spaces. We begin with several auxiliary lemmas.

Lemma 2.1. Let T ∈ L(X ) be semi-regular. Then there exists ǫ > 0 such
that α(T − λ) and β(T − λ) are constant for |λ| < ǫ.

Proof. Let T ∈ L(X ) be semi-regular. The mapping λ → N (T − λ) is
continuous at the point 0 in the gap metric; see [1, Theorem 1.38] or [15,
Theorem 12.2]. In particular, there exists ǫ1 > 0 such that |λ| < ǫ1 implies

4

ˆδ(N (T ), N (T − λ)) < 1. From (1.1) we obtain dimN (T ) = dimN (T − λ),
i.e. α(T ) = α(T − λ) for |λ| < ǫ1. Further, T ′ is also semi-regular where
T ′ is adjoint operator of T [1, Theorem 1.19]. As above we conclude that
α(T ′) = α(T ′ − λ) on an open disc centered at 0. Since T − λ has closed
range for suﬃciently small |λ| [1, Theorem 1.31], it follows that there exists
ǫ2 > 0 such that

β(T ) = α(T ′) = α(T ′ − λ) = β(T − λ) for |λ| < ǫ2.

We put ǫ = min{ǫ1, ǫ2}, and the lemma follows.

Lemma 2.2 ([13]). Let A ∈ L(X ) and B ∈ L(Y). If A and B are both
invertible, then MC is invertible for every C ∈ L(Y, X ). In addition, if MC
is invertible for some C ∈ L(Y, X ), then A is invertible if and only if B is
invertible.

Lemma 2.3 ([20]). (a) Let T ∈ L(X ). The following conditions are equiv-
alent:
(i) There exists (M, N ) ∈ Red(T ) such that TM is bounded below (resp.
surjective) and TN is quasinilpotent;
(ii) T admits a GKD and 0 6∈ acc σap(T ) (resp. 0 6∈ acc σsu(T )).

(b) Let T ∈ L(X ). The following conditions are equivalent:
(i) There exists (M, N ) ∈ Red(T ) such that TM is bounded below (resp.
surjective) and TN is nilpotent;
(ii) T is of Kato type and 0 6∈ acc σap(T ) (resp. 0 6∈ acc σsu(T )).

We now prove our ﬁrst main result.

Theorem 2.4. Let A ∈ L(H) and B ∈ L(K) be given operators on separable
Hilbert spaces H and K, respectively, such that:

(i) A = A1 ⊕ A2, A1 is bounded below and A2 is quasinilpotent;
(ii) B = B1 ⊕ B2, B1 is surjective and B2 is quasinilpotent;
(iii) There exists a constant δ > 0 such that β(A − λ) = α(B − λ) for every
λ ∈ C such that 0 < |λ| < δ.
Then there exists an operator C ∈ L(K, H) such that MC is generalized
Drazin invertible.

Proof. By assumption, there exist closed A-invariant subspaces H1 and H2
of H such that H1 ⊕ H2 = H, AH1 = A1 is bounded below and AH2 = A2
is quasinilpotent. Also, there exist closed B-invariant subspaces K1 and
K2 of K such that K1 ⊕ K2 = K, BK1 = B1 is surjective and BK2 = B2

5

is quasinilpotent. It is clear that β(A − λ) = β(A1 − λ) + β(A2 − λ) and
α(B − λ) = α(B1 − λ) + α(B2 − λ) for every λ ∈ C. Since A2 and B2 are
quasinilpotent we have

β(A − λ) = β(A1 − λ),
α(B − λ) = α(B1 − λ),

(2.1)

(2.2)

for every λ ∈ C \ {0}. Further, according to Lemma 2.1 there exists ǫ > 0
such that

β(A1 − λ) and α(B1 − λ) are constant for |λ| < ǫ.

(2.3)

Consider λ0 ∈ C such that 0 < |λ0| < min{ǫ, δ}, where δ is from the
condition (iii). Using (2.1), (2.2), (2.3) and the condition (iii) we obtain

β(A1) = β(A1 − λ0) = β(A − λ0) = α(B − λ0) = α(B1 − λ0) = α(B1).

On the other hand, it is easy to see that (cid:18) H1
K1 (cid:19) ⊕ (cid:18) H2

K (cid:19) and that (cid:18) H1

subspaces of (cid:18) H

K1 (cid:19) and (cid:18) H2
K2 (cid:19) = (cid:18) H

K2 (cid:19) are closed
K (cid:19). H1 and K1

are separable Hilbert spaces in their own right, so from [12, Theorem 2] it
follows that there exists an operator C1 ∈ L(K1, H1) such that the operator

(cid:18) A1 C1

0 B1 (cid:19) : (cid:18) H1

K1 (cid:19) → (cid:18) H1

K1 (cid:19) is invertible. Let deﬁne an operator

C ∈ L(K, H) by

0

C = (cid:18) C1 0

0 (cid:19) : (cid:18) K1
An easy computation shows that (cid:18) H1
MC = (cid:18) A C

0 B (cid:19) and also

H2 (cid:19) .
K2 (cid:19) → (cid:18) H1
K2 (cid:19) are invariant for
K1 (cid:19) and (cid:18) H2

(MC )H1⊕K1 = (cid:18) A1 C1
(MC )H2⊕K2 = (cid:18) A2

0 B1 (cid:19) ,
0 B2 (cid:19) .

0

Since A2 and B2 are quasinilpotent, from σ((MC )H2⊕K2) = σ(A2)∪ σ(B2) =
{0}, it follows that (MC )H2⊕K2 is quasinilpotent. Finally, (MC )H1⊕K1 is
invertible and thus MC is generalized Drazin invertible.

6

Using Theorem 2.4 we obtain [5, Theorem 2.1] in a simpler way.

Theorem 2.5 ([5]). Let A ∈ L(H) and B ∈ L(K) be given operators on
separable Hilbert spaces H and K, respectively, such that:

(i) A is left Drazin invertible;
(ii) B is right Drazin invertible;
(iii) There exists a constant δ > 0 such that β(A − λ) = α(B − λ) for every
λ ∈ C such that 0 < |λ| < δ.
Then there exists an operator C ∈ L(K, H) such that MC is Drazin invert-
ible.

Proof. By [2, Theorem 3.12] it follows that there exist pairs (H1, H2) ∈
Red(A) and (K1, K2) ∈ Red(B) such that AH1 = A1 is bounded below,
BK1 = B1 is surjective, AH2 = A2 and BK2 = B2 are nilpotent. From the
proof of Theorem 2.4 we conclude that there exists C ∈ L(K, H) such that

MC = (MC )H1⊕K1 ⊕ (MC )H2⊕K2,
(MC)H1⊕K1 is invertible,

(MC)H2⊕K2 = (cid:18) A2

0 B2 (cid:19) .

0

For suﬃciently large n ∈ N we have

(cid:18) A2

0 B2 (cid:19)n

0

= (cid:18) (A2)n

0

0

(B2)n (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 0

0 0 (cid:19) .

It means that (MC )H2⊕K2 is nilpotent, and the proof is complete.

Under the additional assumptions the converse implications in Theorem

2.4 and Theorem 2.5 are also true even in the context of Banach spaces.

Theorem 2.6. Let A ∈ L(X ) and B ∈ L(Y) admit a GKD. If there exists
some C ∈ L(Y, X ) such that MC is generalized Drazin invertible, then the
following holds:
(i) A = A1 ⊕ A2, A1 is bounded below and A2 is quasinilpotent;
(ii) B = B1 ⊕ B2, B1 is surjective and B2 is quasinilpotent;
(iii) There exists a constant δ > 0 such that β(A − λ) = α(B − λ) for every
λ ∈ C such that 0 < |λ| < δ.

Proof. Let MC be generalized Drazin invertible for some C ∈ L(Y, X ). Then
there exists δ > 0 such that MC −λ is invertible for 0 < |λ| < δ. According to
[13, Theorem 2] we have 0 6∈ acc σl(A), 0 6∈ acc σr(B) and that the statement
(iii) is satisﬁed. It means that also 0 6∈ acc σap(A) and 0 6∈ acc σsu(B). By
Lemma 2.3 we obtain that the statements (i) and (ii) are also satisﬁed.

7

Theorem 2.7. Let A ∈ L(X ) be of Kato type and let B ∈ L(Y) admit a
GKD. If there exists some C ∈ L(Y, X ) such that MC is Drazin invertible,
then the following holds:
(i) A is left Drazin invertible;
(ii) B is right Drazin invertible;
(iii) There exists a constant δ > 0 such that β(A − λ) = α(B − λ) for every
λ ∈ C such that 0 < |λ| < δ.

Proof. Applying the same argument as in Theorem 2.6 we obtain that the
statement (iii) holds and 0 6∈ acc σap(A) ∪ acc σsu(B). Now Lemma 2.3 im-
plies that there exist (X1, X2) ∈ Red(A) and (Y1, Y2) ∈ Red(B) such that A1
is bounded below, A2 is nilpotent, B1 is surjective and B2 is quasinilpotent.
Since dsc(B) < ∞ [18, Lemma 2.6], then dsc(B2) < ∞, so B2 is quasinilpo-
tent operator with ﬁnite descent. We conclude that B2 is nilpotent by [16,
Corollary 10.6, p. 332]. Let n ≥ d where d ∈ N is such that (A2)d = 0 and
(A2)d−1 6= 0. We have

N (An) = N ((A1)n) ⊕ N ((A2)n) = X2,
N (Ad−1) = N ((A1)d−1) ⊕ N ((A2)d−1) = N ((A2)d−1) ( X2.

It follows that asc(A) = d < ∞. From R(An) = R((A1)n) ⊕ R((A2)n) =
R((A1)n) we conclude that R(An) is closed and therefore A is left Drazin
invertible. In a similar way we prove that B is right Drazin invertible.

An operator T ∈ L(X ) is semi-Fredholm if R(T ) is closed and if α(T ) or
β(T ) is ﬁnite. The class of semi-Fredholm operators belongs to the class of
Kato type operators [15, Theorem 16.21]. According to this observation it
seems that Theorem 2.7 is an extension of [5, Corollary 2.3].

If δ > 0, set D(0, δ) = {λ ∈ C : |λ| < δ}. The following theorem is our

second main result.

Theorem 2.8. Let A ∈ L(X ) and B ∈ L(Y) be given operators such that
0 6∈ acc σd(A) or 0 6∈ acc σp(B).
(i) If there exists some C ∈ L(Y, X ) such that MC is generalized Drazin
invertible, then A and B are both generalized Drazin invertible.
(ii) If there exists some C ∈ L(Y, X ) such that MC is Drazin invertible, then
A and B are both Drazin invertible.
(iii) If there exists some C ∈ L(Y, X ) such that MC is invertible, then A
and B are both invertible.

8

Proof. (i). Suppose that 0 6∈ acc σd(A) and that MC is generalized Drazin
invertible for some C ∈ L(Y, X ). Since 0 6∈ acc σ(MC ) then there exists
δ > 0 such that

MC − λ is invertible,

R(A − λ) = X ,

(2.4)

(2.5)

for every λ ∈ D(0, δ) \ {0}. From [13, Theorem 2] it follows that A − λ is left
invertible for every λ ∈ D(0, δ) \ {0}. Since A − λ has closed range for every
λ ∈ D(0, δ) \ {0}, from (2.5) we conclude R(A − λ) = R(A − λ) = X for
λ ∈ D(0, δ)\{0}, i.e. A−λ is surjective for λ ∈ D(0, δ)\{0}. Moreover, A−λ
is injective for λ ∈ D(0, δ)\{0}, hence A−λ is invertible for λ ∈ D(0, δ)\{0}.
It means that 0 6∈ acc σ(A), so A is generalized Drazin invertible. Now, (2.4)
and Lemma 2.2 imply that B is generalized Drazin invertible.

Assume that 0 6∈ acc σp(B) and that MC is generalized Drazin invertible

for some C ∈ L(Y, X ). There exists δ > 0 such that (2.4) holds and

B − λ is injective for λ ∈ D(0, δ) \ {0}.

(2.6)

B is generalized Drazin invertible by (2.4), (2.6) and [13, Theorem 2]. We
apply Lemma 2.2 again and obtain that A is generalized Drazin invertible.
(ii). If there exists C ∈ L(Y, X ) such that MC is Drazin invertible, then MC
is also generalized Drazin invertible. According to the part (i) it follows that
B is generalized Drazin invertible, i.e. 0 6∈ acc σ(B). Further, dsc(B) < ∞
by [18, Lemma 2.6], so from [6, Corollary 1.6] it follows that B is Drazin
invertible. We apply [18, Lemma 2.7] and obtain that A is also Drazin
invertible.
(iii). A is left invertible and B is right invertible by [13, Theorem 2]. On
the other hand, the part (i) now leads to 0 6∈ acc σ(A) and 0 6∈ acc σ(B).
The result follows from (1.2) and (1.3).

The part (ii) of Theorem 2.8 is also an extension of [5, Corollary 2.3]. The
following result is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.8. The second
inclusion of Corollary 2.9 is proved in [13, Corollary 4], [8, Theorem 5.1] and
[9, Lemma 2.3].

Corollary 2.9. Let A ∈ L(X ) and B ∈ L(Y). If σ∗ ∈ {σ, σD, σgD}, then
we have

(σ∗(A) ∪ σ∗(B)) \ (acc σd(A) ∩ acc σp(B)) ⊂ σ∗(MC) ⊂ σ∗(A) ∪ σ∗(B)

for every C ∈ L(Y, X ).

9

Remark 2.10. Let T ∈ L(X ). Inclusions acc σp(T ) ⊂ acc σl(T ) ⊂ acc σ(T ) ⊂
σ(T ) and acc σd(T ) ⊂ acc σr(T ) ⊂ acc σ(T ) ⊂ σ(T ) are clear. Accord-
ing to [4, Theorem 12(iii)] and from the fact that the Drazin spectrum is
compact we have acc σp(T ) ⊂ acc σ(T ) = acc σD(T ) ⊂ σD(T ) and also
acc σd(T ) ⊂ acc σ(T ) = acc σD(T ) ⊂ σD(T ). From this consideration we
obtain the following statements for every A ∈ L(X ) and B ∈ L(Y):
(i) acc σd(A) ∩ acc σp(B) ⊂ σ(A) ∩ σ(B);
(ii) acc σd(A) ∩ acc σp(B) ⊂ σD(A) ∩ σD(B);
(iii) acc σd(A) ∩ acc σp(B) ⊂ acc σr(A) ∩ acc σl(B) ⊂ σr(A) ∩ σl(B).

Remark 2.10 shows that Corollary 2.9 is an improvement of [13, Corollary
4], [17, Corollary 3.17] and of the equation (1) in [18]. Another extension of
the equation (1) from [18] may be found in [5, Proposition 2.2].

We also generalize [5, Corollary 2.6].

Corollary 2.11. Let A ∈ L(X ), B ∈ L(Y) and let σ∗ ∈ {σ, σD, σgD}. If
acc σd(A) ∩ acc σp(B) = ∅ then

σ∗(MC) = σ∗(A) ∪ σ∗(B) for every C ∈ L(Y, X ).

(2.7)

In particular, if σr(A) ∩ σl(B) = ∅ then (2.7) is satisﬁed.

Proof. Apply Corollary 2.9 and (iii) of Remark 2.10.

Example 2.12. Let X = Y = ℓ2(N) and let U be forward unilateral shift
operator on ℓ2(N). It is known that

σ(U ) = σD(U ) = σgD(U ) = {λ ∈ C : |λ| ≤ 1}.

Since σp(U ) = ∅, then from Corollary 2.11 we conclude

σ∗(cid:18)(cid:18) A C

0 U (cid:19)(cid:19) = σ∗(A) ∪ σ∗(U ),

where σ∗ ∈ {σ, σD, σgD} and A, C ∈ L(ℓ2(N)) are arbitrary operators.

We ﬁnish with a slight extension of [13, Corollary 7], [18, Theorem 2.9] and
[17, Theorem 3.18].

Theorem 2.13. Let A ∈ L(X ) and B ∈ L(Y). If σ∗ ∈ {σ, σD, σgD}, then
for every C ∈ L(Y, X ) we have

σ∗(A) ∪ σ∗(B) = σ∗(MC) ∪ W,

(2.8)

where W is the union of certain holes in σ∗(MC), which happen to be subsets
of acc σd(A) ∩ acc σp(B).

10

Proof. Expression (2.8) is the main result of [13], [18] and [19]. Corollary
2.9 shows that the ﬁlling some holes in σ∗(MC ) should occur in acc σd(A) ∩
acc σp(B).
