Gamma-Gamma Absorption in the Broad Line Region Radiation

Fields of Gamma-Ray Blazars

Markus B¨ottcher1,2, and Paul Els1

ABSTRACT

The expected level of γγ absorption in the Broad Line Region (BLR) ra-
diation ﬁeld of γ-ray loud Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) is evaluated
as a function of the location of the γ-ray emission region. This is done self-
consistently with parameters inferred from the shape of the spectral energy dis-
tribution (SED) in a single-zone leptonic EC-BLR model scenario. We take into
account all geometrical eﬀects both in the calculation of the γγ opacity and the
normalization of the BLR radiation energy density. As speciﬁc examples, we
study the FSRQs 3C279 and PKS 1510-089, keeping the BLR radiation energy
density at the location of the emission region ﬁxed at the values inferred from the
SED. We conﬁrm previous ﬁndings that the optical depth due to γγ absorption
in the BLR radiation ﬁeld exceeds unity for both 3C279 and PKS 1510-089 for
locations of the γ-ray emission region inside the inner boundary of the BLR. It
decreases monotonically, with distance from the central engine and drops below
unity for locations within the BLR. For locations outside the BLR, the BLR
radiation energy density required for the production of GeV γ-rays rapidly in-
creases beyond observational constraints, thus making the EC-BLR mechanism
implausible. Therefore, in order to avoid signiﬁcant γγ absorption by the BLR
radiation ﬁeld, the γ-ray emission region must therefore be located near the outer
bounary of the BLR.

Introduction

Blazars are a class of radio-loud, jet-dominated active galactic nuclei whose jets are
oriented at a small angle with respect to our line of sight. Their broadband emission is
characterized by two broad non-thermal radiation components, from radio to UV/X-rays,
and from X-rays to γ-rays, respectively. The low energy emission is generally understood to
be due to synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons in a localized emission region in the
jet. In leptonic models for the high-energy emission of blazars (see, e.g., B¨ottcher et al. 2013,
for a discussion of the alternative, hadronic models), the γ-ray emission is due to Compton
upscattering of soft target photon ﬁelds by the same ultrarelativistic electrons in the jet. In
the case of low-frequency-peaked blazars (with synchrotron peak frequencies typically below
∼ 1014 Hz), such as Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQ), which show strong optical – UV
emission lines from a Broad Line Region (BLR), it is often argued that the target photons for
γ-ray production are the external (to the jet) photons from the BLR (e.g., Madejski et al.
1999). This would naturally suggest that the γ-ray emission region is located inside the
BLR, in order to experience a suﬃciently high radiation energy density of this target photon
ﬁeld.

This picture, however, seems to be challenged by the detection of several FSRQs (includ-
ing 3C279, PKS 1510-089: Albert et al. 2008; Abramowski et al. 2013) as sources of very-
high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) γ-rays: VHE γ-rays produced in the intense BLR radiation
ﬁelds of these FSRQs are expected to be subject to γγ absorption (e.g. Donea & Protheroe
2003; Reimer 2007; Liu et al. 2008; Sitarek & Bednarek 2008; B¨ottcher et al. 2009). This
has repeatedly been considered as evidence that the γ-ray emission region must be located
near the outer edge of the BLR (e.g., Tavecchio et al. 2011), in order to avoid excess γγ ab-
sorption by the BLR radiation ﬁeld, or that exotic processes, such as photon to Axion-Like
Particle conversion, may act to suppress the impact of γγ absorption (e.g., Tavecchio et al.
2012).

The above referenced works on the γγ opacity due to the BLR radiation ﬁeld, however,
used generic parameters for the respective FSRQs, independent of parameters and emis-
sion scenarios actually required for the production of the observed γ-ray emission in those
blazars.
In this paper, we consider two VHE γ-ray detected FSRQs, namely 3C279 and
PKS 1510-089. We start out with constraints on the BLR luminosity and energy density
from direct observations, under the assumption that the MeV – GeV γ-ray emission is the
result of Compton upscattering of the BLR radiation ﬁeld (EC-BLR) by the same ultra-
relativistic electrons responsible for the IR – optical – UV synchrotron emission. Within
the observational constraints, we then self-consistently investigate the dependence of the γγ
opacity due to the BLR radiation ﬁeld on the location of the γ-ray emission region. This is

– 3 –

done by re-normalizing the local emissivity in the BLR (within the observational constraints)
for any given location of the γ-ray emission region to result in the required energy density
experienced by the emission region, which is kept ﬁxed in the process.

In Section 2, we describe the general model setup and methodology of our calculations.
Section 3 presents the results, speciﬁcally for 3C279 (Section 3.1) and PKS 1510-089 (Section
3.2). Section 4 contains a brief summary and a discussion of our results.

2. Model Setup

Our considerations are based on the frequently used model assumption that the γ-ray

emission from FSRQ-type blazars is the result of the EC-BLR mechanism (e.g., Ghisellini et al.
2010; B¨ottcher et al. 2013). We represent the BLR as a spherical, homogeneous shell locally
emitting with an emissivity j0
ǫ within an inner (Rin) and outer (Rout) boundary of the BLR.
The geometry of our calculations is illustrated in Figure 1.

Under the single-zone leptonic model assumptions with the EC-BLR mechanism pro-
ducing the MeV – GeV γ-ray emission, the energy density of the BLR can be uniquely
determined solely based on the peak frequencies and νFν peak ﬂuxes of the synchrotron
and EC γ-ray components of the SED. For this purpose, we make the simplifying assump-
tion that the Doppler factor δ = (Γ[1 − βΓ cos θobs])−1 is equal to the bulk Lorentz factor
Γ (corresponding to a normalized velocity βΓ = p1 − 1/Γ2) of the ﬂow, which is true to

within a factor of . 2 for blazars, in which we are viewing the jet at a small observing
angle θobs . 1/Γ. We furthermore assume that the γ-ray peak in the SED is dominated
by Compton upscattering of Lyα photons from the BLR in the Thomson regime. This lat-
ter assumption is valid for FSRQ-type blazars in which the γ-ray peak typically occurs at
E < 1 GeV (and which we are considering in this paper), but may not hold for blazars of
the intermediate- or high-frequency peaked classes.
In the following, photon energies are
expressed as dimensionless values ǫ = hν/(mec2).

The synchrotron peak frequency in the blazar SED is then given by νsy ≈ ν0 BG γ2

p Γ/(1+
z), where ν0 ≈ 4 × 106 Hz, BG is the magnetic ﬁeld in the emission region in units of Gauss,
and γp is the Lorentz factor of electrons radiating at the peak of the SED (i.e., the peak of
the electron energy spectrum in a γ2 n(γ) representation). The EC-BLR peak frequency is
located at ǫEC ≈ ǫLyα γ2
p Γ2/(1 + z), where ǫLyα ≈ 2 × 10−5. These two observables can be
used to constrain the magnetic ﬁeld:

BG =

Denoting fsy/EC as the peak νFν ﬂux values of the synchrotron and EC-BLR components,
respectively, the ratio of EC-BLR to synchrotron peak νFν ﬂuxes may then be used to
constrain the BLR radiation energy density, since

Notably, the dependence on the uncertain bulk Lorentz (and Doppler) factor cancels
out in this derivation, so that Equation 3 provides a rather robust estimate of uBLR in the
framework of a single-zone leptonic EC-BLR interpretation of the blazar SED.

It has been shown (Tavecchio & Ghisellini 2008; B¨ottcher et al. 2013) that the γ-ray
spectrum resulting from Compton upscattering of a thermal blackbody at a temperature of
TBLR = 2 × 104 K is an excellent approximation to the spectrum calculated with a detailed,
line-dominated BLR spectrum. However, γγ absorption features are known to be much more
sensitive to the exact shape of the target photon spectrum. Therefore, for our evaluation of
the γγ opacity in the BLR radiation ﬁeld, we use a detailed, line-dominated BLR spectrum
including the 21 strongest optical and UV emission lines with wavelengths and relative ﬂuxes
as listed in Francis et al. (1991).

Based on the value of uBLR estimated through Equation 3 and observational constraints
on the BLR luminosity LBLR, we ﬁrst estimate the approximate location of the BLR, RBLR
through

RBLR = r LBLR

4π uBLR c

(4)

LBLR is either directly measured or estimated to be a fraction (f ∼ 0.01 – 0.1) of the
accretion-disk luminosity. The boundaries of the BLR are then chosen as R1 = 0.9 RBLR and
R2 = 1.1 RBLR. We have done calculations with diﬀerent widths of the BLR and veriﬁed
that the choice of these boundary radii has a negligible inﬂuence on our ﬁnal results.

For any given location of the emission region at a distance Rem from the central super-
massive black hole of the AGN, the emissivity jǫ at any point within the BLR is then ﬁxed
through the normalization to the required energy density uBLR as resulting from a proper
angular integration, assuming azimuthal symmetry around the x axis:

is within plausible observational uncertainties of the reference value.

3C279

The BLR luminosity of 3C279 was estimated by Pian et al. (2005) to be Lobs

BLR = 2 ×
1044 erg s−1. Representative SEDs of 3C279 (e.g., Abdo et al. 2010) show a synchrotron
peak frequency of νsy ∼ 1013 Hz and a γ-ray (EC-BLR) peak energy of ǫEC ∼ 102, while the
γ-ray to synchrotron ﬂux ratio is characteristically fEC/fsy ∼ 5. This yields an estimate of
the BLR radiation energy density of uBLR = 1 × 10−2 erg cm−3, implying an average radius
of the BLR (according to Equ. 4) of RBLR = 2.3 × 1017 cm.

Figure 2 illustrates the resulting γγ optical depth due to the BLR radiation ﬁeld for
various γ-ray photon energies (lower panel) and the required BLR luminosity (upper panel)
as a function of the location of the γ-ray emission region. For most photons in the VHE
γ-ray regime, the γγ opacity exceeds one for locations far inside the inner boundary of the
BLR, and gradually drops to values slightly below one when approaching the BLR.

It is well known (e.g. B¨ottcher & Dermer 1998) that, for a ﬁxed emissivity (and, hence,
luminosity) of the BLR, the BLR photon energy density slowly increases when approaching
the inner boundary of the BLR. Consequently, as we keep uBLR ﬁxed in our procedure, the
inferred BLR luminosity has to decrease as we consider locations of the emission region closer
to Rin, which adds to the eﬀect of a decreasing optical depth simply due to the decreasing
path length of the γ-ray photons through the BLR radiation ﬁeld. The opacity continues to
decrease as the emission region is located inside the BLR. Notably, the decrease of τγγ for

– 8 –

locations outside the BLR is very shallow, at least for photons at E ≫ 100 GeV, because
the ﬁxed value of uBLR requires a rapidly increasing local emissivity j0
ǫ (and, thus, BLR
luminosity). For this reason, we quickly reach values of Lrequ.
BLR which we consider
excessive compared to the observationally determined value. Thus, if the γ-ray emission
region is located beyond the distance range considered in Figure 2, the GeV γ-ray emission
can no longer be produced by EC scattering of BLR photons with plausible parameter
choices, and would, instead, have to be produced by a diﬀerent mechanism, such as EC
scattering of IR photons from a dusty torus.

3.2. PKS 1510-089

In the case of PKS 1510-089, to our knowledge, no value of the total luminosity of
the BLR has been published. We therefore parameterize the luminosity of the BLR as a
fraction f = 0.1f−1 of the accretion disk, LBLR = f Ld. The accretion disk luminosity
was determined by Pucella et al. (2008) to be Ld = 1.0 × 1046 erg s−1. Characteristic
SEDs of PKS 1510-089 (e.g., Abdo et al. 2010) indicate νsy ∼ 3 × 1012 Hz, ǫEC ∼ 102, and

– 9 –

fEC/fsy ∼ 20, for which Equation 3 yields uBLR = 4.5 × 10−3 erg cm−3, yielding a BLR
radius of RBLR = 7.7 × 1017 f 1/2

−1 cm.

The results for a ﬁducial value of f = 0.1 (i.e., BLR luminosity = 10 % of the accretion
disk luminosity) are illustrated in Figure 3. The general trends are the same as found for
3C279, with slightly larger values of τγγ due to the larger BLR luminosity (assuming f = 0.1)
and larger BLR size. Still, the same conclusion holds: If the GeV γ-rays are produced by
the EC-BLR mechanism, the γ-ray emission region must be located near the outer boundary
of the BLR, whereas for locations far beyond the outer boundary, the EC-BLR mechanism
becomes implausible for the production of the observed GeV γ-ray ﬂux.

Figure 4 illustrates that this general result is is only weakly dependent on the value of
f , with γγ opacities being smaller for smaller values of f (i.e., smaller values of LBLR, but
keeping uBLR ﬁxed). This is expected as a smaller value of LBLR implies a smaller size of the
BLR and, thus, a smaller eﬀective path length of γ-ray photons through the BLR radiation
ﬁeld. Consequently, an approximate scaling τγγ ∝ f 1/2 holds.

4. Summary and Discussion

We have re-evaluated the γγ opacity for VHE γ-rays in the BLR radiation ﬁelds of VHE-
detected FSRQ-type γ-ray blazars. Our method started from a ﬁxed value of the radiation
energy density uBLR and inferred average radius of the BLR, based on the observationally
constrained BLR luminosity. Keeping the value of uBLR ﬁxed, we calculated τγγ for a range
of locations of the γ-ray emission region, from inside the inner boundary to outside the
outer boundary of the BLR. For the speciﬁc examples of 3C279 and PKS 1510-089, we
found that the resulting γγ opacities for VHE γ-ray photons exceed unity for locations of
the γ-ray emission region inside the inner boundary of the BLR (in the case of PKS 1510-
089, this is true for LBLR & 0.1 Ld), in agreement with previous studies (e.g., Liu et al.
2008; Sitarek & Bednarek 2008; B¨ottcher et al. 2009). We ﬁnd that, under the assumption
of the GeV γ-ray emission being produced by the EC-BLR mechanism, the γγ opacity
gradually drops for locations of the γ-ray emission region approaching the BLR and within
the boundary radii of the BLR, reaching values far below unity when approaching the outer
boundary. For locations outside the BLR, the BLR luminosity required to still be able
to produce the observed GeV γ-ray ﬂux through the EC-BLR mechanism, quickly exceeds
observational constraints, thus requiring alternative γ-ray production mechanisms, such as
EC scattering of IR photons from a dusty torus. Alternative radiation mechanisms / target
photon ﬁelds are required in any case for the production of VHE γ-rays, since Compton
scattering of the optical/UV target photons from the BLR to > 100 GeV energies would
occur in the Klein-Nishina regime, in which this process is strongly suppressed.

In the case of PKS 1510-089, the uncertain BLR luminosity allows for conﬁgurations
of the VHE γ-ray emission region even within the inner boundary of the BLR if the BLR
luminosity is LBLR . 10−2 Ld, i.e., in the case of a very small covering factor of the BLR.

The generic estimates of the BLR radiation energy density and inferred radius of the
BLR based on the SED characteristics and the assumption of γ-ray production dominated
by EC scattering of BLR photons, are in reasonable agreement with independent methods of
determining RBLR (and, thus, uBLR). Speciﬁcally, Pian et al. (2005) estimated the size of the
BLR of 3C279 to be RBLR ∼ 9×1016 cm. Bentz et al. (2009) provided a general scaling of the
size of the BLR with the continuum luminosity of the accretion disk, Ld = 1045 Ld,45 erg s−1,
of RBLR ∼ 3 × 1017 L1/2
d,45 cm, where the continuum lumonisity λLλ at λ = 5100 ˚A is used as a
proxy for the disk luminosity. This implies a universal value of uBLR ∼ 3 × 10−2 f erg cm−3,
in reasonable agreement with our SED-based estimates.

The γγ opacity constraints derived here can, of course, be circumvented if (a) the GeV
γ-ray emission is not produced by the EC-BLR mechanism, or (b) the GeV and TeV γ-ray
emissions are not produced co-spatially. In case (a) the energy density of the BLR radiation

– 11 –

ﬁeld at the location of the γ-ray emission region can be arbitrarily small, i.e., the γ-rays can
be produced at distances far beyond the BLR. Evidence for γ-ray production at distances
of tens of pc from the central engine has been found in a few cases, based on correlated
γ-ray and mm-wave radio variability (e.g., Agudo et al. 2011).
In this case, GeV γ-rays
can still be produced in a leptonic single-zone EC scenario by Compton scattering external
infrared radiation from a dusty torus. However, it is often found that, in order to provide
a satisfactory representation of the SEDs of FSRQ-type blazars, both the BLR and the
torus-IR radiation ﬁelds are required as targets for γ-ray production (e.g., Finke & Dermer
2010).
in which the GeV
emission could be produced within the BLR at sub-pc distances, but the VHE γ-rays are
produced at distances of at least several parsecs. In such a scenario, one would not expect
a strong correlation between the variability patterns at GeV and VHE γ-rays. This appears
to be in conﬂict with the correlated GeV (Fermi-LAT) and VHE variability of PKS 1510-
089 (Abramowski et al. 2013) and PKS 1222+21 (Aleksi´c et al. 2011), while the VHE γ-ray
detections of 3C279 by MAGIC (Albert et al. 2008) occurred before the launch of Fermi,
so no statements concerning correlated GeV and VHE γ-ray variability can be made in this
case.

In case (b), one would need to resort to multi-zone models,
