This short note gives a suﬃcient condition for having the class of polynomials dense
in the space of square integrable functions with respect to a ﬁnite measure dominated
by the Lebesgue measure in the real line, here denoted by L2. It is shown that if the
Laplace transform of the measure in play is bounded in a neighbourhood of the origin,
then the moments of all order are ﬁnite and the class of polynomials is dense in L2. The
existence of the moments of all orders is well known for the case where the measure is
concentrated in the positive real line (see Feller, 1966), but the result concerning the
polynomial approximation is original, even thought the proof is relatively simple. This
tool is essential for constructing semiparametric extensions of classic parametric models.
A review on the Laplace transform theory is given in section 2. The main result is
proved in section 3 and an alternative stronger condition easier to be veriﬁed not involving
the calculation of the Laplace transform is given in section 4.

2 Basic properties of the Laplace Transform

In this section we review the basic properties of the Laplace transform. Let f : IR −→
[0, ∞) be a function such that for some s ∈ IR the integral

M(s; f ) = ZIR

esxf (x)λ(dx)

(1)

converges. Here λ is a σ- ﬁnite measure on (IR, B(IR)). The function M( · ; f ) : IR −→
[0, ∞] such that for each s ∈ IR, M(s; f ) is given by (1) is said to be the Laplace transform
of f .

We now study some properties of the functions with ﬁnite Laplace transform in a

neighborhood of zero.

Proposition 1 Let f : IR −→ [0, ∞) be a continuous function such that for some δ > 0
and for all s ∈ (−δ, δ)

M(s; f ) < ∞ .

(2)

Then f possesses ﬁnite moments of all orders, i.e. for all n ∈ N0 = {0, 1, 2, . . .},

xnf (x)λ(dx) ∈ IR .

ZIR

Proof: Since for all s ∈ (−δ, δ), M(s; f ) < ∞, e|sx| ≤ esx + e−sx and using the series
version of the monotone convergence theorem (see Billingsley 1986 page 214 theorem 16.6
1 ) we have

eδxf (x)λ(dx) +ZIR

e|δx|f (x)λ(dx)

and we conclude that the moments of all orders of f are in IR.

1The referred theorem states: ”If fn ≥ 0, then R Pn fndλ =PnR fndλ.”.

The notion of Laplace transform can be extended to functions with range equal to the
whole real line in the following way. Given a function f : IR −→ IR we deﬁne the positive
and the negative part of f respectively by

f +( · ) = f ( · )χ[0,∞){f ( · )} and f −( · ) = −f ( · )χ(−∞,0]{f ( · )} .

Here χA( · ) is the indicator function of the set A. We have clearly the decomposition

f ( · ) = f +( · ) − f −( · ) .

We deﬁne the Laplace transform of a function f : IR −→ IR as the function M( · ; f ) :
IR −→ [−∞, ∞] given by

M( · ; f ) = M( · ; f +) − M( · ; f −) ,

(3)

provided that at least one of the terms of the right side of (3) is ﬁnite (otherwise the
Laplace transform of f is not deﬁned).

Proposition 2 Let f : IR −→ IR and δ > 0 be such that for all s ∈ [−δ, δ], M(s; f ) ∈ IR.
Then, for all n ∈ N and all s ∈ (−δ/2, δ/2), we have

M[s; ( · )nf ( · )] ∈ IR .

Proof: Assume without loss of generality that the function f is nonnegative. Take an
arbitrary s ∈ [−δ/2, δ/2] and n ∈ N. By hypothesis, f has ﬁnite Laplace transform in
a neighborhood of zero; then, from proposition 1, f has ﬁnite moments of all orders, in
particular

x2nf (x)λ(dx) ∈ IR .

ZIR

Using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality we obtain

|M[s; ( · )nf ( · )]| = | < e( · )s, ( · )nf ( · ) >λ |

= | < e( · )sf 1/2( · ), ( · )nf 1/2( · ) >λ |

3 Polynomial approximation in L2

In this section we give a suﬃcient condition for having the class of polynomials dense
in L2(a). Here a is a density with respect to the σ- ﬁnite measure λ of a positive ﬁnite
measure on (IR, B(IR)) and L2(a) is endowed with the usual inner product and norm
denoted by < · , · >a and k · ka respectively. The conditions we give will ensure that the
measure a possesses all moments ﬁnite, i.e. for all k ∈ N,

xka(x)λ(dx) ∈ IR .

ZIR

In that case we can deﬁne the sequence of polynomials {ei( · )}i∈N0 ⊆ L2(a) as the result
of a Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process applied to the sequence {1, ( · ), ( · )2, ...}.
The following theorem gives a suﬃcient condition for {ei( · )} to be a complete sequence
in L2(a), which implies that the polynomials are dense in L2(a).

Theorem 1 Let a : IR −→ IR be a function such that

∀x ∈ IR, a(x) > 0;

∃δ > 0 such that ∀s ∈ [−δ, δ], M(s; a) = ZIR

esxa(x)λ(dx) < ∞ .

Then the orthonormal sequence {ei( · )}i∈N0 is complete in L2(a).

(4)

(5)

Proof: First of all we observe that condition (5) implies that the measure determined by
a possesses ﬁnite moments of all orders (see proposition 1).

Let f : IR −→ IR be a function in L2(a) such that for all k ∈ N0,

xkf (x)a(x)λ(dx) = 0 .

ZIR

(6)

We prove that f ( · ) = 0 a-a.e. which implies the theorem (see Luenberg, 1969, Lemma 1,
page 61).

Deﬁne for each k ∈ N0, t ∈ [−δ/2, δ/2] and x ∈ IR,

fk(x) = (xt)kf (x)a(x) .

We will use a series version of the dominated convergence theorem applied to {fk}. In
for all
the following we ﬁnd a Lebesgue integrable function dominating uniformly (i.e.

k) the functions fk, which will enable us to use the referred theorem. We have for each
n ∈ N, k ∈ N0, t ∈ [−δ/2, δ/2] and x ∈ IR,

where the function g is given, for all x ∈ IR, by

g(x) = (cid:26)|f (x)|qa(x)(cid:27)(cid:26)qa(x)(ext + e−xt)(cid:27) .

We prove that the function g is Lebesgue integrable. For, note that

Then the second term in the right side of (8) is in L2(λ). Using the Cauchy-Schwartz
inequality (see Luenberg, 1969, lemma 1, page 47) we obtain

Since (7) holds for each n ∈ N, x ∈ IR, t ∈ [−δ/2, δ/2] and g is Lebesgue integrable
we can use the series version of the dominated convergence theorem (see Billingsley, 1986,
theorem 16.7 page 214 2 ) to obtain

4 Functions with exponentially decaying tails

The following proposition gives a suﬃcient condition for having the Laplace transform
deﬁned in a neighborhood of zero, which is easy to verify.

Proposition 3 Let f : IR −→ [0, ∞) be a continuous function such that for some δ > 0
and for all s ∈ [−δ, δ]

lim

x→+∞

esxf (x) = lim
x→−∞

esxf (x) = 0 ·

(10)

Then we have:

i) For all s ∈ (−δ, δ) the Laplace transform of f , M(s; f ), is ﬁnite.

ii) For all k ∈ N,

lim

x→+∞

xkf (x) = lim
x→−∞

xkf (x) = 0

Proof:
i) Take s ∈ (−δ, δ). Condition (10) implies that there exists L ∈ IR+ such that for all
x ∈ IR \ [−L, L], eδxf (x) < 1 and e−δxf (x) < 1. We have then

M(s; f ) =ZIR

e(s−δ)xλ(dx) +Z(−∞,−L]

e(δ−s)xe−δxf (x)λ(dx)

e(δ−s)xλ(dx) < ∞ .

ii) For each k ∈ N

and

lim

x→+∞

xkf (x) = lim
x→+∞

{e−δxxk}{eδxf (x)} = 0

lim

x→−∞

xkf (x) = lim
x→−∞

{eδxxk}{e−δxf (x)} = 0
