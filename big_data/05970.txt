Abstract

We construct explicit codes for transmitting classical or quantum information over the thermal-
noise Bosonic Gaussian channel. For classical information transmission, our codes achieve the
classical capacity, recently characterized by Giovannetti et al.
[Nature Photonics 8, 796 (2014)],
while in the quantum case they transmit at a rate given by the Gaussian coherent information.
The construction is based on concatenating polar codes with a suitable discretization of the channel
input into a ﬁnite “constellation” of coherent states. The codes have eﬃcient encoders, but the
complexity of decoding is unknown. Our results are based on a quantum version of Wu and Verd´u’s
technique of determining the achievable rates of ﬁnite constellations for the classical Gaussian-noise
channel [Allerton 2010, pp. 620].

Introduction

Practical optical communication channels, such as optical ﬁbers or free-space propagation, are ulti-
mately quantum-mechanical in nature. Thus, we must look beyond classical information theory to
determine the communication capacity as well as to ﬁnd eﬃcient, high-rate encoding and decoding
schemes. Indeed, these questions were the genesis of the ﬁeld of quantum information theory. Many
such channels can be modelled as Bosonic Gaussian channels, which simpliﬁes their study since phase
space methods can be employed. One particular interesting class of channels are thermal-noise chan-
nels, which can be deﬁned as the composition of an attenuation channel and a noise channel adding
Gaussian noise.

The ultimate capacity for transmitting classical information over thermal-noise channels has been
recently established in [1]. Less is rigorously established about the quantum capacity of such channels,
but it is widely believed that the regularized version of the coherent information is the correct quantity
(see e.g. [2]). En route to a better understanding of the quantum case, it was shown in [3] that the
maximum of the coherent information when restricting to Gaussian inputs is achieved by choosing as
input the thermal state with mean photon number tending to inﬁnity.

However, for practical applications we are interested in eﬃcient encoding and decoding schemes,
which ideally can also be implemented by Gaussian (linear optics) operations. In this contribution,
we address this question. Speciﬁcally, we construct an explicit polar code that achieves the classical
capacity as well as a (likewise explicit) quantum polar code that achieves the coherent information
(restricted to Gaussian inputs) of thermal-noise channels. On the way to the latter, we construct a
polar code for private information transmission that also achieves the coherent information.

Our code constructions are based on discretizing the optimal channel input to a ﬁnite “constella-
tion”, and then using a polar code on the induced channel. That is, the optimal thermal input state,
which can be viewed as a Gaussian-weighted mixture of coherent states, is replaced by a ﬁnite convex
combination of particular coherent states. To establish that rates achievable over the discretized chan-
nel approach those of the original channel, we adapt the results of Wu and Verd´u [4] to the quantum
case. This shows that, as in the classical case, to achieve high rates it is not necessary to emulate the
optimal channel input in the strong sense of trace distance, but rather in a much weaker topology.

In the following, we ﬁrst review the setup of thermal-noise channels, state our main contribution,
and brieﬂy review previous results. The remainder of the paper then describes the discretization and
code construction steps in more detail.

1.1 Bosonic channels

Thermal-noise channels We consider single-mode thermal-noise channels [1], denoted Ek,N0, which
describes an input mode interacting with a thermal state with mean photon number N0 at a beam-
splitter of transmittivity k < 1. The channel action can be described by the following transformation
of the annihiliation operators a and b of the input (signal) and auxiliary (ancilla) modes, respectively:

a → a′ = ka +p1 − k2b,
b → b′ = kb −p1 − k2a,

(1a)

(1b)

where the ancilla mode is initially in the thermal state with mean photon number N0. Equivalently,
deﬁning Nc = (1− k2)N0, Ek,N0 describes the composition of an attenuation channel (N0 = 0 in Ek,N0)
with coeﬃcient 0 ≤ k ≤ 1 and a channel adding Gaussian-distributed noise to each quadrature with
identical variance √Nc.1

Achievable rates and capacities For a ﬁxed maximum input mean photon number N , the classical
capacity C(N ) of the thermal-noise channel has been shown [1] to be the Holevo information of the
channel, evaluated for the thermal state of mean photon number N . More formally, we have the
following. Let Z be a random variable over C with probability density
PZ (z) = ψN (z) := (πN )−1 exp(−|z|2/N ),

|zi the coherent state centered at z ∈ C, and θB
expressed as

z = E A→B

C(N ) = I(Z : B)ρ,

where ρZB is the classical-quantum state corresponding to the ensemble {PZ (z), θB
B)ρ is deﬁned as

k,N0 (|zihz|A). Then, the capacity can be

Determining the quantum capacity of the channel is a more elusive task. Here we will settle for the
single-letter quantum capacity Q(1), which in general is given by maximizing the coherent information.

is not needed, as Planck’s constant sets the appropriate scale. While the optimization is unsolved
for arbitrary states,3 Holevo and Werner have shown that when restricting to Gaussian states, the
optimizer is τN for N → ∞ [3]. We denote the associated quantity Q(1)
G . The corresponding output is
given by τN ′ where N′ = k2N + Nc.

1The case k = 1 requires the latter formulation; see [5, Sec. 4].
2We must use ensembles here as the more usual cq-state formalism does not yield a proper quantum state when the

classical random variable is continuous.

3The optimal input is Gaussian when the channel is degradable [2].

1.2 Our results: new coding schemes

We propose explicit coding schemes, both for classical and for quantum information transmission over
the thermal-noise channel. Both consist of applying a modulation scheme to map a ﬁnite classical or
quantum system into the quantum channel, combined with a polar code for discrete channels.

In classical information theory, such modulations are designed to emulate the optimizer of the
channel mutual information, as this gives a means for showing that the overall coding scheme can
approach the Shannon capacity. Here we take the same approach, and aim to emulate τN , the optimizer
in both the Holevo information and coherent information.

A particularly appealing choice is based on the Gauss-Hermite quadrature. This discretizes the
Gaussian distribution to a discrete distribution over m points in R such that the ﬁrst 2m− 1 moments
Indeed, Gauss-Hermite quadrature is optimal in that it reproduces the
are correctly reproduced.
largest number of moments for ﬁxed m.
In our case, we apply this discretization in phase space,
speciﬁcally to the P function of τN . As described above, this is a circularly-symmetric complex
Gaussian, and we use the quadrature to mimic the real and imaginary parts separately.

The polar code construction provides an explicit code that achieves the capacity of the induced
channel. The use of polar codes also ensures the encoding operation is eﬃcient, though it is not known
if eﬃcient decoding is possible when the channel outputs noncommuting states. We then show that
as m increases, the rate of the classical code approaches the classical capacity and the rate of the
quantum code approaches the Gaussian coherent information, both exponentially in m. Speciﬁcally,
we show the following:

Theorem 1. There exist explicitly-constructable codes for transmitting classical information at rate
C(N ) and for transmitting quantum information at rate Q(1)
G over the thermal noise channel Ek,N0.
In the former case, the codewords are products of coherent states drawn from a ﬁnite set, while the
latter requires superpositions of products of coherent states.

The proof can be broadly separated into two parts: First, in Sec. 2 we relate the construction
of coherent state constellations and modulation schemes to classical constellations for the AWGN
channel, which enables us to apply the results of Wu and Verd´u [4]. Second, in Sec. 3 we employ these
constellations and construct polar coding schemes “on top”, i.e. concatenating the polar code with the
modulation scheme. For this, we ﬁrst focus on classical and private communication, and then describe
a quantum coding scheme based on entanglement distillation.

1.3 Comparison to previous results

In establishing the formula for the classical capacity, [1] relies on random coding arguments. For the
pure loss case (N0 = 0), Wilde and Guha constructed polar codes for a constellation of two coherent
states (BPSK) [6] whose optimal rate approaches the capacity in the limit of vanishing input mean
photon number.

For quantum coding, Harrington and Preskill gave a random coding argument for achieving the
coherent information for the k = 1 case in [7]. Their construction is not based on discretization, but
rather embedding an appropriate number of qubits directly into the state space of a larger number
of modes, using the method of Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill [8]. The practicality of this method
is limited, even disregarding the non-explicit nature of the code, as it ostensibly requires codewords
which are superpositions of highly squeezed states.

Meanwhile, Devetak’s proof [9] that the coherent information and its regularization are achievable
rates of quantum communication does not deal with continuous-variable channels, though it seems
straightforward to extend his method by suitably truncating the input and output spaces of the
continuous-variable channel. Doing so would lead to random codes involving superpositions of products
of number states.

2 Coherent state constellations

We consider constellations of coherent states |zi formed by using this classical constellation in both the
real and imaginary parts of z. Speciﬁcally, the constellation is described by the distribution QN,m(z),
supported on m2 points, such that

N

2 (x + iy)) = PXm (x)PXm(y),

(7)

where PXm is one of the four constellations considered in [4]. In terms of random variables, Zm =
q N
2 (Xm + iX′m), where Xm and X′m are independent realizations of the given constellation. The
factor √N ensures that the resulting P function has variance N , while the 1/√2 factor takes care of
the conversion from two real to one complex variable.

Now we sketch how to upper-bound the gap between the coherent information and the rate of the
polar code applied to the induced discretized channel. A simpler version of the same argument yields
the analogous result for the classical capacity.

Let us denote the target rate without using modulation as R, and the associated rate using the
modulation with m points Rm. The former is the coherent information of the channel, while the latter
is the same entropic expression, but evaluated for the input state given by the discretization scheme.
The coherent information may be written as R = I(Z : B) − I(Z : E) for PZ as in (2), and Rm is
the same expression, evaluated with Z ∼ QN,m. Here E the output of the channel to the environment
(i.e. its puriﬁcation).
We would like to upper-bound ∆ = R − Rm, which can be written as ∆ = ∆B − ∆E for ∆B =
I(Z : B)− I(Zm : Bm) and similarly for ∆E. Here, Zm denotes the classical random variable obtained
when measuring the discretized input, and Bm the channel output for the discretized input. Clearly,
we need not consider ∆E for the problem of classical information transmission. These quantities can
be written as relative entropies. More speciﬁcally, we have the following lemma.

Lemma 1. Let ρZBE and ρZmBmEm
in §1.1) and QN,m as in (7), respectively. Then

∆E := I(Z : E) − I(Zm : Em) = D(ρEm

m kρB),
m kρE).

(9a)

(9b)

Proof. Let R denote either B or E; the following argument will work in both cases. We have ∆R =
H(R) − H(R|Z) − H(Rm) + H(Rm|Zm). Since both inputs are mixtures of coherent states, the state
outputs conditioned on the inputs are the same; hence H(R|Z) = H(Rm|Zm).
k,N0 are Gaussian.
Therefore, ρR is a zero-mean Gaussian state, equivalent up to unitary conjugation to a tensor product
of thermal states. It follows that log ρR is a second-order polynomial q(r, r†) of the output creation
and annihilation operators. We thus have

k,N0 and the complementary channel E A→E

Now observe that both the channel E A→B

where E†k,N0 is the channel adjoint and, since the channel is Gaussian, p(a, a†) is a second-degree

polynomial in the input creation and annihilation operators. Similarly, we have Tr[ρRm
m match those of ρR, we have
Tr[ρA

mp(a, a†)]. Finally, due to the fact that the ﬁrst two moments of ρR
m log ρR] = Tr[ρR log ρR]. A short calculation shows that ∆R = D(ρRm

m kρR).

4

As the relative entropy is non-negative, we immediately have ∆E ≥ 0, and we need only an upper
bound for ∆B. A convenient choice is the χ2-distance, given by χ2(ρ, σ) = Tr(cid:2)(ρσ−1/2)2(cid:3) − 1, since
D(ρkσ) ≤ χ2(ρ, σ) [10, 11].
In [4], Wu and Verd´u obtain a bound on the χ2-distance between the optimal output state and the
discretized version for the case of the classical Gaussian channel. They relate χ2(PYm , PY ) directly to
the moments of Xm, speciﬁcally the moments of the Hermite polynomials of Xm. (These all vanish for
standard normal X, save the zeroth order polynomial.) Indeed, they show the slightly more general
statement
Lemma 2 ([4, §V.A]). Let X ∼ N(0, 1) and X′ be an arbitrary random variable with density PX ′.
Then, for Y = Ws(X) and Y ′ = Ws(X′) with s > 0,

Fortunately, we can use their result to bound χ2(ρBm

m , ρB). We show the following statement:

Lemma 3. With QN,m(q N

∆B ≤ (1 + χ2(PYm, PY ))2 − 1.

(11)
Hence, per [4, §VII], using the quantile or random walk constellations will lead to ∆B decaying as
the inverse of the number of points in the coherent state constellation m2, while the Gauss-Hermite
quadrature leads to ∆B ≤ O(e−cm) for appropriate c. Lemma 3 is a consequence of the χ2 bound
described above and following lemma relating the quantum and classical χ2 quantities for general
factorizable P functions. The proof is given in the Appendix.

3 Polar codes for the thermal-noise channel

The polar code construction can be used for classical, private classical, and quantum coding. Here we
provide only the essential details for the present case and will not attempt to provide a background on
polar coding. One could also appeal to other capacity-achieving schemes for the task of transmitting
classical information, e.g. spatially-coupled LDPC codes [12], but no explicit quantum coding schemes
besides polar codes are known to achieve the coherent information. Common to all our coding scenarios
is a truncation of the output space to ﬁnite dimensions, as described in §1.3. This ensures that we
may apply existing results on the construction and properties of polar codes.4

3.1 Classical coding

Wilde and Guha [13] show how to construct polar codes to transmit classical information over channels
with classical input and ﬁnite-dimensional quantum output. Here, the modulator selects a coherent
state input for the Bosonic Gaussian channel, but the choice of which input to make is classical. They
only considered the case of uniformly-random channel input (beﬁtting the equilattice or quantile
constellations), but this restriction can be lifted by the construction of Honda and Yamamoto [14]
(using modiﬁed polarization statements found in [15]), so as to apply to CLT or Gauss-Hermite
constellations. Thus, a rate of I(Zm : Bm) is achievable. Wilde and Guha appeal to Arikan’s original
encoder, hence encoding is eﬃcient. Their quantum version of the successive cancellation decoder is
likewise explicit, but its implementation complexity is unknown.

4It appears that all the necessary statements also hold for channels with inﬁnite-dimensional outputs, but we have

not shown this deﬁnitively.

5

3.2 Private coding

For private coding, the task is not only to transmit information reliably, but also to hide it from an
eavesdropper. Codes to do so are constructed by one of us and Wilde in [16], where it is shown that the
“naive” wiretap rate I(Zm : Bm) − I(Zm : Em) is achievable. Generally, the code requires secret-key
assistance at nonzero rate, but not if the channel is degradable [2], e.g. for pure-loss (N0 = 0).
Crucial to the construction is the observation is that the channels to the legitimate receiver Bob and
to the eavesdropper Eve are related by an entropic uncertainty relation. Eve’s information about the
actual classical message must be small if the code is constructed so that it could send complementary
“phase” information to Bob. The construction in [16] is again for uniform channel inputs, but can
be extended as just described above. The uncertainty principle argument is unaﬀected by having
non-uniform channel inputs.

3.3 Quantum coding

For quantum coding, we proceed as in the case of private coding, except we use the channels to send
quantum states. Now we regard the modulator as mapping the kth basis state of an m2-dimensional
quantum system to the kth coherent state in the constellation. Since this mapping is not unitary, the
coherent information of the modulator composed with Ek,N0 is lower than that of Ek,N0 itself. This
implies that we cannot employ the method of Devetak [9] to upgrade a private code to a quantum
code (at least, not at the same rate).

Instead, we employ a scheme based on one-way entanglement distillation, combining it with tele-
portation to enable transmission of arbitrary states [17]. Recall that in entanglement distillation, Alice
and Bob use local operations and classical communication to transform many copies of a bipartite
mixed state into a number of maximally-entangled states. The mixed state in question is that ob-
tained by Alice transmitting the state in (8) through the channel to Bob, while keeping its puriﬁcation.
Abusing notation and denoting by QN,m(k) the probability of the kth coherent state |zki, the state
at the input to the channel can be written

|ψiA′A =

m2

Xk=1qQN,m(k) |bkiA′

|zkiA ,

(12)

where the |bki are an orthonormal basis for an m2-dimensional space A′. Here we are interested in
using stabilizer codes for entanglement distillation, where Alice makes stabilizer measurements on A′
and sends the outcomes (the syndrome) to Bob. Bob then uses this side information to execute a
decoding operation on his system. By choosing a suitable stabilizer code, Alice and Bob end up with
copies of a maximally-entangled state. As shown in [15, 18], by using a polar code the scheme has
G (Ek,N0) as m → ∞. Moreover, Alice’s
stabilizer measurements can be done eﬃciently, since the required quantum circuit is just the polar
coding circuit.

rate equal to I(Zm : B) − I(Zm : E) which approaches Q(1)

This scheme can be converted into a quantum code involving no classical communication as follows.
Consider a particular syndrome, selected in advance and known to Bob (since the ﬁnal state is entan-
gled, the distribution of syndromes is essentially uniform). Instead of preparing many copies of the
state |ψiA′A and making the stabilizer measurement, Alice could just create the bipartite state that
results when the given syndrome is observed. After receiving the channel output Bob proceeds with
his decoding operation. By the properties of stabilizer codes, each logical codeword will correspond
to a superposition of tensor products of coherent states.

4 Conclusions and Outlook

We have constructed three classes of codes for the Bosonic Gaussian channel, all based on concatenation
of polar coding with suitable discretizations of the channel into a constellations of input coherent states.
For transmitting classical information, this leads to explicit codes with eﬃciently-implementable en-
coders that achieve the channel capacity. Moreover, the encoder need only prepare products of coherent

6

states. An explicit decoder is known, the successive cancellation decoder of [13], but it is not known
how to implement it eﬃciently for non-commuting channel outputs.

For transmitting classical information privately, our codes naively achieve the unoptimized wiretap
rate I(Z : B) − I(Z : E), but this could presumably be improved by preprocessing exactly as in the
classical wiretap scenario. Again the encoding is eﬃcient, but may require secret-key assistance as
the thermal-noise channel is not degradable. Degradability is not strictly necessary, however, and the
methods of [19] could be used to determine k and N0 parameter combinations where key-assistance is
not required.

In fully quantum case, we have shown how to employ a one-way entanglement distillation scheme
in order to send quantum information at a rate given by the Gaussian coherent information. Alice’s
operations are eﬃciently implementable in this scheme, but it is not clear how to eﬃciently generate
the corresponding quantum codewords for use in a standard error-correction scenario.

An intriguing open question is whether polar coding techniques can be applied directly in the phase
space representation of Gaussian channels, possibly yielding more tractable encoding and decoding
operations.

Now we give the expression for the relevant classical χ2 quantity, χ2(PY ′, PY ) with an arbitrary

input X′. To this end deﬁne, for s ≥ 0 and x, x ∈ R,

Ks(x, x′) :=

1 + s
√1 + 2s

exp(cid:20)−

s

2(1 + 2s)(cid:0)s(x − x′)2 − 2xx′(cid:1)(cid:21) .

Lemma 5. For random variables X, X′, Y , and Y ′ as in Lemma 2,

1 + χ2(PY ′, PY ) =ZR2

dx dx′ PX ′(x)PX ′ (x′)Ks(x, x′).

Proof. First observe that PY (y) = ϕ1+s(y), while

PY ′(y) =ZR

dx PX ′(x)ϕ1(y − √sx).

where we have implicitly deﬁned Is(x, x′) as the inner integral. This is a simple Gaussian integral,
and using (14) we ﬁnd Is(x, x′) = Ks(x, x′).

Next we turn to the expression for the quantum χ2 quantity.

Lemma 6. Let ρ be a state with positive P function (a probability density P ). For any N > 0,

1 + χ2(ρ, τN ) =ZC2

dz dz′ P (z) P (z′) CN (z, z′),

(21)

where, for tN =q N +1

N ,

Proof. Computing the trace in the number basis, we get

CN (z, z′) := (N + 1) exp(cid:2)−|z|2 − |z′|2 + tn(z¯z′ + ¯zz′)(cid:3) .

This proves (21).

With these two intermediate results, we are ready to establish Lemma 4.

Proof of Lemma 4. Using the form of θz as described in §1.1, it is apparent that the P function of ρ
is simply

Pρ(w) =ZC

dz Q(z)ψNc (w − kz).

Now applying Lemma 6 with number parameter N′, we have

1 + χ2(ρ, τN ′) =ZC2
=ZC2

dz dz′ Q(z) Q(z′) ZC2

dz dz′ Q(z) Q(z′)RN ′(z, z′),

dw dw′ ψNc (w − kz)ψNc (w′ − kz′)CN ′(w, w′)

(23)

(24)

where we have implicitly deﬁned the inner integral as RN ′(z, z′).

Recalling (2) and using AN =(cid:18) 1

in matrix form, we obtain a Gaussian integral for RN ′(z, z′):

(25)

Here z = (z, z′) and similarly for w. The integrand has the form e− ¯wT Aw+¯uT w+ ¯wT v where A =
AN ′ + 1/Nc and u = v = k/Ncz. Applying (14) to (25), we obtain

RN ′(z, z′) =

To simplify this expression, let c = N′ − Nc and d =pN′(N′ + 1); these are the prefactors of the
ﬁrst and second terms in the argument of the exponential, absent the denominator. Observe that the
denominator itself is simply d2 − c2. Now notice that s as deﬁned in the statment of the lemma is such
that s/(1 + s) = c/d. By direct substitution it is easy to show that the prefactor of the exponential in
(27) simpliﬁes to

N′(N′ + 1)

N′ + 2N′Nc − N 2

c

=

(1 + s)2
1 + 2s

Therefore,

RN ′(z, z′) =

As c = k2N , we obtain

RN ′(q N

2 (x + iy),q N

2 (x′ + iy′)) = Ks(x, x′)Ks(y, y′).

Returning to (24) and changing variables z →q N

Appealing to Lemma 5 completes the proof.
