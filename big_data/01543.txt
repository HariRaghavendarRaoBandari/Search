ABSTRACT

The γ-ray loud narrow line Seyfert 1 (γ-NLSy1) galaxy PKS 1502+036 (z = 0.409) exhibited its ﬁrst γ-ray
outburst on 2015 December 20. In the energy range of 0.1-300 GeV, the highest ﬂux measured by Fermi-Large
Area Telescope is (3.90 ± 1.52) × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1, which is the highest γ-ray ﬂux ever detected from this
object. The associated spectral shape is soft (Γ0.1−300 GeV = 2.57 ± 0.17) and this corresponds to an isotropic
γ-ray luminosity of (1.2 ± 0.6) × 1048 erg s−1. We generate the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED)
during the GeV ﬂare and reproduce it using a one zone leptonic emission model. The optical-UV spectrum
can be explained by a combination of synchrotron and the accretion disk emission, whereas, the X-ray to γ-ray
SED can be satisfactorily reproduced by inverse-Compton scattering of thermal photons originated from the
torus. The derived SED parameters hint for the increase in the bulk Lorentz factor as a major cause of the ﬂare
and the location of the emission region is estimated as outside the broad line region but still inside torus. A
comparison of the GeV ﬂaring SED of PKS 1502+036 with that of two other γ-NLSy1 galaxies, namely, 1H
0323+342 (z = 0.061) and PMN J0948+0022 (z = 0.585), and also with FSRQ 3C 279 (z = 0.536) has led
to the conclusion that the GeV ﬂaring SEDs of γ-NLSy1 galaxies resemble with FSRQs and a major fraction
of their bolometric luminosity is emitted at γ-ray energies.

1. INTRODUCTION

Blazars, a peculiar class of active galactic nuclei (AGN)
with relativistic jets pointed towards the observer, are
known to exhibit high amplitude γ-ray ﬂux variations (e.g.,
Abdo et al. 2011; Paliya 2015). Along with blazars, Fermi-
Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT; Atwood et al. 2009) has
also detected variable γ-ray emission from about half-a-dozen
radio-loud narrow line Seyfert 1 (RL-NLSy1) galaxies (e.g.,
Abdo et al. 2009; Calderone et al. 2011; Paliya et al. 2015).
Though these sources host low luminosity jets compared to
powerful ﬂat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs; Foschini et al.
2015), multiple episodes of γ-ray outbursts have been ob-
served from some of the γ-ray emitting NLSy1 (γ-NLSy1)
galaxies when their isotropic γ-ray luminosity exceeds 1048
erg s−1 (e.g., Foschini et al. 2011b; D’Ammando et al. 2012).
In general, FSRQs are known to emit such powerful GeV
outbursts. Prior to this work, GeV ﬂares have been ob-
served only from 3 γ-NLSy1 galaxies, namely, 1H 0323+342
(z = 0.061; Paliya et al. 2014), SBS 0846+513 (z = 0.585;
D’Ammando et al. 2012), and PMN J0948+0022 (z = 0.585;
Foschini et al. 2011b; D’Ammando et al. 2015). A broadband
study of these peculiar events are of great importance to un-
derstand the physical properties of relativistic jets in γ-NLSy1
galaxies at different black hole mass and accretion rate scales.
PKS 1502+036 (z = 0.409) is one of the RL-NLSy1
galaxies detected in γ-ray band (Abdo et al. 2009).
It is a
faint but persistent γ-ray emitter (e.g., Calderone et al. 2011;
Paliya et al. 2015) and subsequently included in the recently
released third catalog of Fermi-LAT detected objects (3FGL;
Acero et al. 2015).
It exhibits a compact core-jet struc-
ture (Orienti et al. 2012) and has a brightness temperature
of ∼1012 K (Yuan et al. 2008). Rapid infra-red and intra-
night optical variabilities of this source are also reported

(Jiang et al. 2012; Paliya et al. 2013a). Recently, this ob-
ject was in a high γ-ray activity state when a γ-ray ﬂux
as high as ∼1 × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1, in 0.1−300 GeV en-
ergy range, was detected by LAT on 2015 December 20
(D’Ammando & Ciprini 2015). This is the ﬁrst GeV ﬂare ob-
served from this source. A quasi-simultaneous Swift telescope
monitoring ensured the contemporaneous coverage of this pe-
culiar event at lower energies as well (D’Ammando 2015).
Motivated by the availability of good quality data, we study
this rare event following a variability and broadband spec-
tral energy distribution (SED) modeling approach. Through-
out, we adopt a ΛCDM cosmology with the Hubble constant
H0 = 71 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.27, and ΩΛ = 0.73.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTIONS

2.1. Fermi-Large Area Telescope Observations

We follow the standard data reduction procedure1 and de-
scribe it brieﬂy. The recently released Pass 8 data, covering
the period of the outburst (2015 December 16 to 2015 De-
cember 23 or MJD 57372−57379), are used to extract the
0.1−300 GeV SOURCE class events which are lying within
10◦ region of interest (ROI) centered at the 3FGL position
of PKS 1502+036. To minimize the contamination from
Earth limb γ-rays, we reject the events having zenith an-
gle >90◦. The data analysis is performed with the Science-
Tools (v10r0p5) package and post-launch instrument response
function P8R2 SOURCE V6. The signiﬁcance of γ-ray sig-
nal is determined by adopting a maximum likelihood (ML)
test statistic TS=2∆log(L), where L represents the likelihood
function between models with and without a point source at
the position of source of interest (Mattox et al. 1996). All the
sources present in the 3FGL catalog and lying within the ROI
are considered and their spectral parameters are kept free to

Paliya and Stalin

vary during the unbinned likelihood ﬁtting. We also include
the sources lying within 10◦ to 15◦ from the center of the ROI
and their parameters are ﬁxed to the 3FGL catalog values. We
perform a ﬁrst run of the ML analysis and the sources with
TS<25 are removed from further analysis.

The γ-ray variability properties of the source are studied by
generating light curves with various time binnings (1 day, 12
hr, 6 hr, and 3 hr). To generate the light curves, we freeze the
photon indices of all the sources to the values obtained from
the average analysis of the period of interest. Furthermore, to
test for the presence/absence of a possible curvature, we apply
various models to the γ-ray spectrum of the object. This in-
cludes a log-parabola (N (E) = N0(E/Ep)−α−β log(E/Ep),
where α is the photon index at Ep, β is the curvature index and
Ep is ﬁxed at 300 MeV), and a power law model. We estimate
2σ upperlimits for the time/energy bins with ∆Fγ /Fγ > 0.5,
where ∆Fγ is error in the ﬂux Fγ, and/or 1<TS<92. We do
not consider the bins with TS<1 in the analysis. Statistical
uncertainties are estimated at 1σ level.

2.2. Swift Observations

A Swift target of opportunity observation was performed on
2015 December 22 (D’Ammando 2015). Swift X-ray Tele-
scope (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005) observed the source in the
most sensitive photon counting mode for a net exposure of
∼2.8 ksec. We perform the standard ﬁltering and data analy-
sis (xrtpipeline) using HEASOFT (v 6.17) and the cal-
ibration database updated on 2015 November 5. To extract
the source spectrum, we select a circular region of 30′′, cen-
tered at the target. Background events are extracted from an
annular region of inner and outer radii of 50′′ and 150′′, cen-
tered on the source, respectively. We combine the exposure
maps using the task ximage and xrtmkarf is used to gen-
erate ancillary response ﬁles. The source spectrum is binned
to have at least 1 count per bin. We adopt an absorbed power
law (NH = 3.93 × 1020 cm−2; Kalberla et al. 2005) and use
C-statistics (Cash 1979) to perform spectral ﬁtting in XSPEC.
The associated errors are calculated at 90% conﬁdence level.
Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al.
2005) observed PKS 1502+036 in all the six ﬁlters. We
use the task uvotimsum to add the individual frames. The
source magnitudes are extracted using uvotsource, cor-
rected for galactic extinction following Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner
(2011), and converted to ﬂux units using the zero points and
conversion factors of Breeveld et al. (2011).

3. RESULTS

3.1. Variability and Spectral Properties

The γ-ray ﬂux variations of PKS 1502+036, covering the
period of GeV outburst, are presented in Figure 1. As can
be seen, the source entered in high activity state around MJD
57374. The rise in the ﬂux appears smooth, as evident from
the daily and 12 hr binned light curves and the maximum oc-
curred on MJD 57376. Though the photon statistics is not
good enough to perform a detailed ﬂare proﬁle ﬁtting, the
visual inspection of the 6 hr binned light curve indicates a
slow rise and fast decay trend. Immediately after the ﬂare, the
source returned to low activity and was hardly detected after
that, as evident from the 3 hr binned light curve. To determine
the highest ﬂux and also the shortest ﬂux doubling/halving
time, we generate the γ-ray light curve using bin sizes equal

to good time intervals (GTI, e.g., Foschini et al. 2011a). A
GTI is the shortest time period when LAT data can be con-
sidered ‘valid’3. The maximum ﬂux using this approach is
derived as (3.90 ± 1.52) × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1 in the GTI
bin 57376.1242−57376.1788, which is the highest γ-ray ﬂux
ever detected from PKS 1502+036 and is about 86 times its
ﬁve year average value (Paliya et al. 2015). No short term ﬂux
variability, of the order of hours or less, is detected.

FSRQs are known to exhibit a pronounced curvature in
their γ-ray spectrum, especially during ﬂaring episodes (e.g.,
Paliya 2015). Such feature is also observed in the high activ-
ity state γ-ray spectrum of γ-NLSy1 galaxy SBS 0846+513
(Paliya et al. 2015). With this in mind, we search for the
presence of spectral curvature in the γ-ray spectrum of PKS
1502+036 by deriving the TS of the curvature (TScurve =
2(log L(log-parabola) − log L(PL)); Nolan et al. 2012). We
obtained a TScurve = 2.01, indicating the absence of the cur-
vature. Furthermore, the photon index obtained from aver-
age analysis of the period of interest is 2.57 ± 0.17 which
is similar to that obtained from its ﬁve year average value
(Paliya et al. 2015).
During the ﬂare,

the 0.3−10 keV X-ray ﬂux increases
by a factor of ∼1.5 with respect to the low activity state
(3.52+0.73
× 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1, see Table 1) studied in our
−0.62
earlier work (Paliya et al. 2013b). There are hints for the spec-
tral hardening (Γ0.3−10 keV = 1.33+0.56
−0.55), however a strong
claim cannot be made due to large errors. Comparing to the
same low activity state, the source brightened by ∼0.5−0.7
magnitudes in optical-UV bands during the GeV ﬂare, as re-
vealed by Swift-UVOT monitoring (Table 1).

3.2. Spectral Energy Distribution

The broadband SED of PKS 1502+036 is generated for the
period MJD 57375−57379 (see Figure 1). This period is cho-
sen on the basis of the availability of multi-frequency data
and also the requirement to generate good quality LAT spec-
trum. The generated SED is shown in the top panel of Figure
3 and the associated ﬂux values are reported in Table 1. For a
comparison, we also show a relatively low activity state SED
considered in our earlier work (Paliya et al. 2013b).

The generated broadband SED is modeled following the
prescriptions of Ghisellini & Tavecchio (2009) and here it is
brieﬂy described. The emission region is assumed to be spher-
ical and moves with a bulk Lorentz factor Γ. The relativistic
electrons present in the emission region emit via synchrotron
and inverse Compton processes and are assumed to follow a
smooth broken power law energy distribution (Figure 2)

N ′(γ ′) = N0

b)p + (γ ′/γ ′

b)q ,

(1)

where p and q are the energy indices before and after the
break energy (γ ′
b), respectively, and prime quantities are in
comoving frame. The spectrum of the accretion disk is con-
sidered as a multi-temperature blackbody (Frank et al. 2002).
Above and below the disk, we assume the presence of X-ray
corona whose spectrum is considered as a cut-off power law.
The broad line region (BLR) and the torus are assumed as
spherical shells located at distances RBLR = 1017L1/2
disk,45 cm
and Rtorus = 1018L1/2
disk,45 cm, respectively, where Ldisk,45
is the accretion disk luminosity in units of 1045 erg s−1(e.g.,

2 TS = 9 corresponds to ∼3σ detection (Mattox et al. 1996).

Kaspi et al. 2007; Bentz et al. 2009). We calculate the relative
contributions of these components with respect to the distance
from the central black hole following Ghisellini & Tavecchio
(2009). We derive the black hole mass and the accre-
tion disk luminosity as 107.65 M⊙ and 1044.78 erg s−1, re-
spectively, by reproducing the low activity state optical-UV
spectrum with a standard optically thick, geometrically thin
Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) accretion disk model (see Figure
3). The accretion disk luminosity can be constrained from
the observations, provided the big blue bump is visible and
assuming a ﬁx accretion efﬁciency (considered as ηdisk =
10%). This leaves the black hole mass as the only free param-
eter. A large black hole mass implies a larger accretion disk
surface and that, in turn, hints the lower value of the peak disk
temperature needed to emit a ﬁxed accretion disk luminosity
(see, Frank et al. 2002), thus implying a ‘redder’ spectrum.
The hole hole mass and the accretion disk luminosity derived
by us (4.5 × 107M⊙ and 6 × 1044 erg s−1, respectively) are
similar to that reported by Ghisellini et al. (2014). It should
be noted that the black hole mass derived from this method
agrees, on average, within a factor of ∼4 to that obtained
from virial relationship (Ghisellini & Tavecchio 2015). On
the other hand, a broader limiting range of the disk luminos-
ity can be set by ensuring 10−2LEdd < Ldisk < LEdd. The
lower limit assumes the accretion disk is radiatively efﬁcient
and the upper limit ensures the source to be sub-Eddington.
Furthermore, along with synchrotron photons, electrons also
scatter thermal photons entering from the accretion disk, the
BLR, and the dusty torus via external Compton (EC) process.
Various jet powers are derived following the prescriptions of
Celotti & Ghisellini (2008). In particular, kinetic jet power is
calculated by assuming the protons to be cold and having an
equal number density to that of electrons. The viewing angle
is assumed as θview = 3◦, a value typically considered for
blazars (e.g., Ghisellini & Tavecchio 2015). We model both
GeV ﬂaring and low activity SEDs using the methodology
described above and show them in Figure 3. The associated
modeling parameters are given in Table 2.

4. DISCUSSION

At the peak of the ﬂare, the highest γ-ray ﬂux measured is
(3.90 ± 1.52) × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1 and the associated pho-
ton index is 2.57±0.17. This corresponds to an isotropic γ-
ray luminosity (Lγ) of (1.22 ± 0.57) × 1048 erg s−1, which is
∼96 times larger than its ﬁve year average value (Paliya et al.
2015). Furthermore, the γ-ray luminosity in the jet frame
would be Lγ,em ≃ Lγ/2Γ2 ≃ 1.7 × 1045 erg s−1, assum-
ing Γ = 19, obtained from SED modeling. Interestingly, this
is a signiﬁcant fraction of the total available accretion power
(∼35%, Lacc ≃ Ldisk/ηdisk ≃ 6 × 1045 erg s−1; assuming
radiative efﬁciency ηdisk = 10%) and also comparable to Ed-
dington luminosity (∼33%, LEdd ≈ 5.7 × 1045 erg s−1).

A careful examination of the jet energetics reveals few in-
teresting features. First, the power spent by the jet in the form
of radiation is larger than the sum of the jet power in electrons
and magnetic ﬁeld, during the GeV ﬂare. This indicates the
requirement for another power source to account for the ra-
diative power and the assumption of the cold protons present
in the jet would be the most plausible option. It should be
noted that this feature has already been seen in the GeV ﬂares
of other γ-NLSy1 galaxies (e.g., Paliya et al. 2016, ApJ,
in press), in addition to previously known luminous FSRQs
and radio galaxies (Ghisellini et al. 2014; Tanaka et al. 2015).
Furthermore, considering the radiative efﬁciency of the jet as

ηrad = Pr/Pjet, we ﬁnd ηrad = 0.32 and 0.04 during the GeV
ﬂare and the low activity state, respectively. This suggests an
efﬁcient conversion of the jet kinetic power to the radiative
power during the γ-ray ﬂaring activity.

The high activity state optical-UV spectrum of PKS
1502+036 can be explained as a combination of synchrotron
and the accretion disk radiation. Compared to the low activity
state where a break is observed (that can be interpreted as a
falling synchrotron and a rising accretion disk radiation), the
shape of the high state optical-UV SED hints for enhanced
synchrotron emission during the ﬂare. Though the X-ray ﬂux
levels appear similar in both the activity states, the X-ray
spectrum becomes harder during the GeV ﬂare, which we in-
terpret as a rising EC process. The γ-ray window of the SED
can be well explained by EC mechanism with seed photons
provided by IR-torus, similar to that reported by Paliya et al.
(2013b). This sets the location of the emission region far out
from the BLR but still inside the dusty torus (Table 2). The
location of the emission region is derived from the following
two constraints. First, we did not ﬁnd any short timescale
ﬂux variability in the γ-ray band. Assuming it to be ∼1 day
(similar to that taken by Paliya et al. 2013b) and consider-
ing the conical geometry of the jet with semi opening angle
θjet = θview = 3◦ (∼ 1/Γ), we have

Rdiss = 20Rblob . 20

ctvarδ
(1 + z)

≈ 0.16pc

(2)

where tvar is the timescale of variability and δ = 1/[Γ(1 −
β cos θview)]. Now, the size of the BLR and the dusty torus
are derived as 0.02 parsec and 0.5 parsec, respectively, thus
indicating the emission region to be located outside the BLR
but inside the torus. Second, in one zone models, the loca-
tion of the synchrotron peak constrains the position of the
IC peak. Since, the characteristic frequency of BLR photons
(∼1015 Hz) is higher than that of torus photons (∼1013 Hz),
corresponding EC-BLR will peak at higher frequencies than
EC-torus process. In other words (see, Tavecchio et al. 2007)

νpeak,obs ≃

νseedΓ2γ ′2
b
(1 + z)

(3)

where νpeak,obs is the observed peak frequency of the EC pro-
cess, νseed is the characteristic frequency of seed photons for
b is the break Lorentz factor constrained
EC mechanism, and γ ′
from the location of the synchrotron peak (Table 2). This
gives, νpeak ≈ 1024 Hz or 1022 Hz, provided the seed pho-
tons are originating from the BLR or the dusty torus. It is clear
that EC-BLR process cannot explain the observed soft γ-ray
spectrum that demands the IC peak to lie at lower frequen-
cies. This indicates the EC-torus as a plausible mechanism to
reproduce the observed γ-ray spectrum. Furthermore, we can
neglect EC-BLR emission by assuming the emission region to
be sufﬁciently far out from the BLR where its contribution to
comoving frame total radiation energy density is negligible.
In the bottom panel of Figure 3, we plot the variation of the
radiation energy densities as a function of the distance from
the central engine and as can be seen, the emission region is
probably located outside the BLR.

The γ-ray spectral shape remains similar in both the activity
states, however, the ﬂux increases by an order of magnitude.
Comparing the SED parameters obtained during the ﬂare with
that derived during the low activity state, we ﬁnd increase in
the bulk Lorentz factor as a major cause of the outburst. This
is also supported by the fact that though optical-UV and X-ray

4

ﬂuxes also increase, a major enhancement is seen in the γ-
ray band only. In the emission region frame, the synchrotron
emissivity can be adopted as (e.g., Shu 1991)

where U is the external photon density and starred quantities
are in the AGN frame. Comparing Equation 4 and 5 we ﬁnd
that the excess in EC emissivity can be achieved by enhanc-
ing the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet, without altering the syn-
chrotron emissivity. There are few other factors that changes
such as the increase in the energy of the injected electrons and
a slight enhancement of the magnetic ﬁeld (Table 2). Overall,
these parameters and/or their combination can reproduce the
observed brightening seen in the γ-ray band. Furthermore,
though we explain both X-ray and γ-ray emission via same
EC mechanism, the ﬂux increment appears relatively lower in
the former. This is primarily because we reproduce low ac-
tivity state X-rays via synchrotron self Compton (SSC) pro-
cess and it also has some contribution during the GeV ﬂare
(see Figure 3). Similar to optical-UV, following Equation 4
and 5, a relatively lower variability at X-rays with respect to
γ-rays can be understood. Furthermore, the value of the min-
imum energy of electrons (γ ′
min) also changes between the
two states, which is due to different spectral shape observed
at X-ray energies. A soft X-ray spectrum hints to be origi-
nated either from X-ray corona (Paliya et al. 2014) or from
SSC process. This suggests EC process to contribute negligi-
bly in the X-ray band, requiring a relatively large γ ′
min. On
the other hand, during the ﬂare, the X-ray spectrum becomes
min = 1.
ﬂatter and to explain it via EC mechanism, we need γ ′
It is of great interest to compare the ﬂaring state SED
of PKS 1502+036 with that of other GeV ﬂaring γ-NLSy1
galaxies. With this in mind, we generate SEDs of two other
γ-NLSy1 galaxies covering their GeV outbursts, namely,
1H 0323+342 (Paliya et al. 2014) and PMN J0948+0022
(D’Ammando et al. 2015). We do not include another GeV
ﬂaring γ-NLSy1 galaxy SBS 0846+513 because there were
no simultaneous multi-wavelength observations at the time of
its GeV ﬂare (see, D’Ammando et al. 2012). In luminosity vs.
frequency plane, we plot all the SEDs and the results are pre-
sented in Figure 4.
In this plot, PKS 1502+036 is slightly
more luminous at optical-UV energies than 1H 0323+342,
however, both the shape and the luminosity of the X-ray spec-
trum of PKS 1502+036 are similar to that of 1H 0323+342.
At γ-ray energies, PKS 1502+036 is more luminous than 1H
0323+342. The apparent differences in the γ-ray band can be
understand in terms of the higher Doppler boosting in the case
of PKS 1502+036. For 1H 0323+342, Paliya et al. (2014) no-
ticed the bulk Lorentz factor of the ﬂaring emission region as
Γ = 8, whereas for PKS 1502+036, it is 25. It should be noted
that γ-ray luminosity also depends on the external photon en-
ergy density which itself depends on the bulk Lorentz factor.
In particular, assuming the emission region to lie inside BLR,

we have (e.g., Ghisellini & Tavecchio 2009)

assuming RBLR ∼ 1017L1/2
d,45 cm and ηBLR is the fraction
of the accretion disk luminosity reprocessed by BLR and
here taken as 10%. A similar relation holds for the torus
energy density also. Both the BLR and the torus adjust
their sizes according to the accretion disk luminosity so as
to give a constant radiative energy density in the lab frame.
Furthermore, there are few other factors which one should
take into account, e.g., the location of the emission region,
which was found to be inside the BLR for 1H 0323+342
and outside the BLR for PKS 1502+036. This suggests a
higher magnetic ﬁeld for the case of former, implying a high
level of synchrotron and SSC emission. A high synchrotron
emission is not reﬂected in the optical-UV spectrum of 1H
0323+342 due to the fact that its synchrotron radiation peaks
at around sub-milimeter frequencies and thus the observed
optical-UV radiation is dominated by the disk emission, even
during the GeV ﬂare (see, Paliya et al. 2014). On the other
hand, modeling of the ﬂaring SED of PKS 1502+036 indi-
cates a signiﬁcant contribution of the synchrotron mechanism
at optical-UV energies. This could be one of the reason for
the higher optical-UV luminosity of PKS 1502+036. A possi-
ble explanation for the difference in the locations of the syn-
chrotron peaks for 1H 0323+342 and PKS 1502+036 can be
given on the basis of the difference in their accretion disk
luminosities. The accretion disk of 1H 0323+342 is more
powerful than that of PKS 1502+036, though it is not re-
ﬂected in the observed optical-UV band. This is because
the peak of the disk luminosity occurs at unobserved far-
UV energies for 1H 0323+342 (Abdo et al. 2009; Paliya et al.
2014; Itoh et al. 2014). A higher disk luminosity means a
denser external photon ﬁeld which, in turn, indicates a faster
cooling of the emitting electrons before they could reach to
higher energies. Accordingly, synchrotron peak will lie at
lower frequencies and may not contribute signiﬁcantly in the
optical-UV band. Furthermore, a high SSC emission and
also contribution from the EC scattering of the accretion disk
photons (EC-disk; Paliya et al. 2014) can explain the simi-
lar X-ray luminosity of 1H 0323+342 with PKS 1502+036.
A comparison of the SED of PKS 1502+036 with PMN
J0948+0022 reveals that the latter one is more powerful at
all the energies. The accretion disk luminosity of PMN
J0948+0022 is derived as 9 × 1045 erg s−1 (Foschini et al.
2012) and 1.18 × 1046 erg s−1 (Foschini et al. 2015) based
on the accretion disk model ﬁtting and optical spectroscopic
approach, respectively. This suggests the accretion disk of
PMN J0948+0022 to be more luminous than PKS 1502+036
and can be clearly seen in the optical-UV band. The higher
luminosity of the former at X-ray and γ-ray energies could be
due to stronger boosting and larger power of injected electrons
(D’Ammando et al. 2015).

In our earlier work, we compared the low activity SEDs
of γ-NLSy1 galaxies with FSRQ 3C 454.3 (z = 0.859) and
BL Lac object Mrk 421 (z = 0.031; Paliya et al. 2013b) and
found them to resemble more to FSRQs. Later, few other ob-
servations, such as curved γ-ray spectrum, also supported this
ﬁnding (e.g., Paliya et al. 2015). Therefore, it is interesting to
test whether GeV ﬂaring SEDs of γ-NLSy1 galaxies are also
similar to that of FSRQs. We, therefore, generate SED of the
FSRQ 3C 279 covering its recent GeV outburst in 2015 June

(Paliya 2015) and plot it along with other γ-NLSy1 galaxies
in Figure 4. As can be seen, 3C 279 is more luminous than
any γ-NLSy1 galaxy, especially at γ-ray energies. The over-
all shapes of the SEDs of 3C 279 and γ-NLSy1 galaxies are
similar, thus suggesting similar mechanisms to be working for
the observed ﬂaring behaviors, with more extreme parameters
for 3C 279. Finally, the Compton dominance (the ratio of
the inverse-Compton to synchrotron peak luminosities) of all
the GeV ﬂaring γ-NLSy1 galaxies is found to be greater than
unity, a feature generally exhibited by FSRQs like 3C 279.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the ﬂaring state behavior
of γ-NLSy1 galaxies resembles more to powerful FSRQs.
