If the spacetime metric has anisotropic spatial curvature, one can aﬀord to expand the
universe isotropically, provided that the energy-momentum tensor satisfy a certain con-
straint. This leads to the so-called shear-free metrics, which have the interesting property
of violating the cosmological principle while still preserving the isotropy of the cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB) radiation. In this work we show that shear-free cosmologies
correspond to an attractor solution in the space of models with anisotropic spatial curva-
ture. Through a rigorous deﬁnition of linear perturbation theory in these spacetimes, we
show that shear-free models represent a viable alternative to describe the large-scale evo-
lution of the universe, leading, in particular, to a kinematically equivalent Sachs-Wolfe
eﬀect. Alternatively, we discuss some speciﬁc signatures that shear-free models would
imprint on the temperature spectrum of CMB.

1. Introduction

The standard concordance model of cosmology – or ΛCDM model – is based on
three main ingredients: i) the validity of general relativity at cosmological scales,
ii) the validity of the standard model of particle physics at all cosmological epochs
and distances and iii) the cosmological principle, according to which our universe is,
on average, spatially homogeneous, isotropic and inﬁnite. While the ﬁrst two ingre-
dients have been largely tested, modiﬁed and scrutinized as an attempt to explain
diverse phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy, attempts to question the
validity of the cosmological principle happens at a slower pace, mainly because of
our inabilities to collect data from regions other than our insigniﬁcant corner in an
otherwise indiﬀerent and colossal universe.

Notwithstanding the fact that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radi-
ation is isotropic at 0.001% level,1, 2 and that the distribution of matter at scales

above 100h−1Mpc are compatible with the cosmological principle,3–5 one cannot
take for granted a principle of central importance to the whole scientiﬁc endeavor.
On the other hand, attempts to extend the cosmological principle have to cope with
these very data suggesting isotropy and homogeneity.

There are two ways of bridging the extensions of the cosmological principle with
observational data. One is to admit that small deviations of isotropy and homogene-
ity are hidden under current cosmological data, either lurking in the precision of
our current experiments or, to take the example of CMB, in the form of large-scale
statistical anomalies.6 The second alternative is to formulate symmetry-violating
models that respect the data we have at hand.

In this work we explore the second of these alternatives and investigate a class of
spatially anisotropic models which preserve, at the background level, the observed
isotropy of CMB. In particular, we start from previous works in which the anisotropy
of the universe results from the curvature of the spatial sections, and not from
the kinematics of expansion.7–10 Such feature is implemented by metrics admitting
shear-free expansion,7 and in this work we focus on two particular cases: Bianchi
type III and Kantowski-Sachs metrics.

This work is organized as follows: in section 2.1 we describe a simple class of
anisotropic metrics admitting anisotropic spatial curvature, and show that, for a
speciﬁc choice of the energy-matter content, these metrics lead to an attractor so-
lution in which the universe expands isotropically. Assuming that shear-free models
go through a period of inﬂationary expansion, we show in section 2.2 that the the-
ory of linear perturbations in these models is feasible, and leads to very speciﬁc
signatures. In section 2.3 we explore a few signatures that shear-free models would
imprint on the temperature spectrum of CMB. We conclude in section 3 with some
perspectives of extensions of this work.
Throughout this work use metric signature (−, +, +, +) and adopt units such
that c = 1 = 8πG. Space and spacetime indices are represented by Latin and
Greek letters, respectively. The lower case letters (a, b, c) represent coordinates on
two-dimensional manifolds.

2. Shear-free anisotropy

Once we are willing to admit our ignorance about the global symmetries of the
universe, we ﬁnd that there is much more to anisotropy than just anisotropic ex-
pansion.11–13 In fact, there exists anisotropic solutions of the Einstein ﬁeld equations
in which not only the expansion of the universe is anisotropic, but so is the cur-
vature of spatial sections.14, 15 In the standard four-dimensional description of the
universe, one waya of constructing a manifold with anisotropic curvature is by mul-
tiplying the (ﬂat) one-dimensional real line R with a curved two-dimensional space

aEvidently, there exist more sophisticated three-dimensional geometries, such as the Nil, Sol and
SL(2, R) geometries, which we will not consider here. For a recent cosmological study involving a
Bianchi type II solution (which corresponds to the Nil geometry) see Ref. 16.

M. If we restrict, for the sake of simplicity, to maximally symmetric two-dimensional
spaces, then there are only two possibilities: either M is a sphere (S2) or a pseudo
sphere (H2). The ﬁrst case represents the known Kantowski-Sachs (KS) anisotropic
solution, while the second gives the Bianchi type III (BIII) metric. In comoving
cylindrical coordinates, these two solutions can be parameterized as follows:

(cid:21)

where α is the average scale factor and σ measures the spatial shear. The number
κ measures the curvature of the two-dimensional spaces, and can be either −1
(BIII), +1 (KS). Incidentally, we note that κ = 0 also corresponds to the locally-
rotationally-symmetric Bianchi I solution.

Given that (1) is already anisotropic at the level of the spatial curvature, it is
natural to ask whether these models can evolve with a single scale factor. Indeed,
it has been shown that for some speciﬁc choices of the energy-momentum content,
these models admit a shear-free (SF) expansion,7, 8 that is, there exist anisotropic
cosmological solutions with σ = 0 in (1). Thus, before developing the observational
signatures of SF models, it is important to investigate whether these solutions are
dynamically stable.

2.1. Background dynamics

Let us consider the scenario of a universe with metric (1) and composed of a perfect
ﬂuid with energy density ρf and pressure pf , plus some anisotropic source of energy
and momentum. To be more speciﬁc, let us model the latter by a two-form ﬁeld Bµν,
for which we know that shear-free solutions exist10b. The total energy-momentum
tensor of the system is thus:

Tµν = (ρ + p)uµuν + pgµν + πµν

requires γ < 0.

The above system is quite general and can be applied to diﬀerent scenarios with
diﬀerent perfect ﬂuids. We are particularly interested to see whether an inﬂationary
(more precisely, de Sitter) phase would produce shear-free expansion, which would
then determine the metric during the following radiation and matter dominated
eras, possibly aﬀecting the formation of CMB anisotropies. We thus consider the
case with ω = −1, for which the point

is a stable ﬁxed point18 – see Fig. (1). It is worth mentioning that, since by deﬁ-
nition Ωκ ∝ −κ (see (11)), the above result imply that only the BIII geometry is
dynamically stable. However, this does not exclude the possibility that the KS ge-
ometry leads to a stable ﬁxed points when couplings between the ﬂuids are allowed.
For a more sophisticated dynamical analysis in KS spacetimes, see.19

Fig. 1. Attractor behavior of the shear-free solution on the planes ΩB × Σ (left) and Ωκ × Σ
(right).

Thus, cosmologies with metric (1) possess an attractor solution in which the
universe, although anisotropic, will expand isotropically. Since the metric has only
one scale factor, it can be brought to a conformally static form

ds2 = a2(η)(cid:2)−dη2 + γab(xc)dxadxb + dz2(cid:3) ,

(13)

which implies that the CMB will be perfectly isotropic.20, 21 Moreover, provided
that the stress tensor “balances” the spatial curvatured – see Eq. (6) – the shear
decays and the background equations in conformal time will be given by

These are exactly the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) equations of universes
with spatial curvature. Evidently, the anisotropy in the spatial curvature will lead
to new signatures at the perturbative level, which we now explore.

dRigorously speaking, the stress tensor has to equal the electric part of the Weyl tensor in these
spacetimes.7

2.2. Perturbation Theory

As far as the machinery of gauge-invariant and linear cosmological perturbations is
concerned, perturbation theory in anisotropic spacetimes22–25 is essentially the same
as its isotropic cousin.26 Nonetheless, when one departures from FRW universes,
there are three main aspects which require attention. These are:

(1) the dynamics of the background spacetime;
(2) the geometry of constant-time hypersurfaces;
(3) the determination of spatial eigenfunctions.

Thus, for example, perturbation theory in Bianchi I spacetimes is directly aﬀected
by item (1) since, at the background level, the anisotropy of expansion couples per-
turbative modes through the background shear, even if they are decoupled at some
initial time.22, 23 Consequently, one cannot track the evolution of each perturbative
mode independently, which considerably complicates the analysis. SF models are
obviously exempt from this diﬃculty, and in this regard they are much simpler to
perturb. On the other hand, SF are directly aﬀected by items (2) and (3), from
which most of their distinctive observational signatures follows.

SF space-times are orthogonal models, which means that they admit a timelike
vector ﬁeld everywhere orthogonal to the spatial hypersurfaces. Thus, say, metric
perturbations can be naturally split into time-time (or scalars, e.g. δg00), space-time
(or 3-vectors, e.g., δg0i), and space-space components (or 3-tensors, e.g. δgij). Next,
3-vectors and 3-tensors can be further decomposed into their irreducible pieces,
according to the symmetries of the spatial hypersurfaces where they live. In the
case of isotropic FRW spacetimes, the spatial sections are invariant under the SO(3)
group, which leads to the standard Scalar-Vector-Tensor (SVT) decomposition of
perturbations.26, 27 As we have seen, the spatial hypersurfaces of SF universes is a
product manifold, and we thus implement an irreducible decomposition according
to the symmetries of each submanifold.

Thus, in the real line R one can only have scalars, while in the two-dimensional

submanifold of metric (13), vectors and tensors are decomposed as:

V a = DaV + ¯V a ,
hab = 2Sγab + DaDbU + D(a ¯Eb) ,

(16)

(17)

where (V, S, U ) are scalars and ( ¯V a, ¯Ea) are transverse vectors: Da ¯Va = 0 = Da ¯Ea.
Note that, in two dimensions, transverse vectors are essentially scalars. Moreover,

there are no transverse and traceless tensors in two dimensions. Of course, this does
not mean that there are no gravitational waves, but rather that each polarization of
the wave come from a diﬀerent perturbative sector. However, this does imply that
each polarization will have its own dynamics. Incidentally, this is a general feature
of anisotropic spacetimes28, 29 which can be relevant to the recently founded era of
gravitational wave astronomy.30

The last step to the implementation of perturbation theory is the determination
of a complete set of spatial eigenfunctions. This step cannot be overlooked since,
without it, crucial cosmological observables, like the primordial power spectrum,
cannot be computed. The eigenfunctions φq that we are looking for are the solutions
of the eigenvalue problem

(18)

where hij is the metric on spatial sections of (13). In the cylindrical coordinates of
metric (1), these eigenfunctions can be found by means of a simple separation of
variables. They are, up to a normalization factor, given by:31, 32

φq(x) ∝

P m−1/2+i(cid:96)(cosh ρ)eimϕeikz ,
P m

(BIII)

(19)

where P µ
related to the wave-vector q through the following dispersion relations:

ν (z) are associate Legendre polynomialse. The eigenvalues (cid:96), m and k are

(cid:40)

(cid:40)

q2 =

(cid:96)2 + k2 + 1/4 ,
((cid:96) + 1/2)2 + k2 − 1/4 .

(BIII)

(KS)

(20)

Some general remarks about these results are in order: ﬁrst, it is straightforward
to show that, in the limit of small distances and large (cid:96), both eigenfunctions become

φq(x) ∝ (cid:96)1/2Jm((cid:96)ρ)eimϕeikz .

As expected, these are the spatial eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on a ﬂat FRW
universe. Second, note that the eigenvalues m do not appear explicitly in the disper-
sion relations (20), which reﬂects the residual rotational symmetry of (13). Finally,
we note that in both BIII and KS cases there is an intrinsic lower limit to the
“Fourier” mode q. In fact, the largest wave in BIII has (cid:96) = 0 = k, whereas in KS it
hasf (cid:96) − 1 = 0 = k. In both cases, thus

q ≥

1

|curvature scale| .

(21)

In other words, there can’t be a wave larger than the curvature scale in such
universes. This feature oﬀers an interesting observational window through the
Grishchuk-Zel’dovich eﬀect.33, 34

eNote that (ρ, (cid:96)) ∈ R+ in H2, whereas ρ ∈ [0, π) and (cid:96) ∈ N in S2.
f The case (cid:96) = 0 in KS corresponds to a monopole, and can thus be neglected.

From the above recipes, it is a straightforward but rather tedious task to pa-
rameterize metric and matter perturbations, construct gauge-invariant variables and
linearize Einstein equations. The reader interested in the details can check Ref. 29.
We now comment on the observational signatures that SF models would imprint in
the CMB.

2.3. Observational signatures

In order to discuss observational signatures of SF models, let us thus focus on scalar
perturbations. Assuming an inﬂationary period, the perturbations to the metric are
found to be:31

ds2 = a2(η)[−(1 + 2Φ)dη2 + (1 − 2Φ)dxidxi] ,

(22)

where dxidxi = γabdxadxb + dz2 and where Φ is the only gauge-invariant scalar
metric perturbation. Interestingly, the above line element is identical to the one
we ﬁnd from scalar metric perturbations in an inﬂationary FRW universe. Thus,
from the dynamical point of view, Φ has the same time evolution as the Newtonian
gravitational of standard perturbation theory. A corollary of the above result is
that, since the Sachs-Wolfe (SW) eﬀect is purely kinematic, it has the same shape
in SF universes. That is

∆T (ˆn) =

1
3

Φ(x, η) .

(23)

Of course, SW eﬀect will still lead to diﬀerent signatures, since in the above relation
x are the coordinates of a point in a manifold with anisotropic spatial curvature.
In order see how these diﬀerences comes about, we can compute the two-point
correlation function (2pcf), C(ˆn, ˆn(cid:48)) = (cid:104)∆T (ˆn)∆T (ˆn(cid:48))(cid:105), under the assumption that
the gravitational potential that we measure today is one realization of a Gaussian
random variable. In “Fourier” space, this is implemented by the relation

(cid:104)Φ(q)Φ∗(q(cid:48))(cid:105) = P(q) ×

(tanh (cid:96)π)−1δmm(cid:48)δ((cid:96) − (cid:96)(cid:48))δ(k − k(cid:48))
(2π) δmm(cid:48)δ(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:48)δ(k − k(cid:48))

(BIII) ,

(KS) ,

(24)

where P(q) is the (anisotropic) primordial power spectrum. Expanding Φ in the
eigenfunctions (19) and using some identities of Bessel functions, one can easily
show that, in the BIII case31

mind the reader that, in deriving these expressions, we have used the fact the
P(q) = P((cid:96), k) cannot depend on the eigenvalue m, since the latter is associated
with an angular variable of a rotationally symmetric (sub) space. It is important to

(26)
where ∆ρ2 = ρ2 + ρ(cid:48)2 − 2ρρ(cid:48) cos(ϕ − ϕ(cid:48)). A further integrationg reveals that, in
this case, the 2pcf is only a function of ϑ = arccos(ˆn · ˆn(cid:48)), as one expects from
isotropy. However, we prefer to keep Eq. (26) in its present form to compare with
Eqs. (25). There are two main diﬀerences between them. The ﬁrst is obviously in the
anisotropy of the primordial power spectrum P, which in the SF cases is a function
of the modes (cid:96) and k. Rigorously speaking, one should ﬁx P((cid:96), k) by canonically
quantizing the inﬂaton perturbations in SF universes. However, since we are only
interested in the general signatures of SF models, we can take a simpler route by
demanding that the anisotropic 2pcf recovers C(ϑ) in the limit of coincident points:

C(n, n(cid:48))|n=n(cid:48)

!= C(ϑ)

(27)
which completely ﬁx P((cid:96), k) in terms of the isotropic power spectrum P(q). The
second diﬀerence between (26) and (25) is that the function J0 in the kernel of the
integral gets replaced by P µ
ν , the latter being a function of the distance between
two points in a curved two-dimensional space. As we know, CMB data suggest that
the observable universe is spatially ﬂat.1 Thus, in the light of current observations,
shear-free models should be considered in the limit of large spatial curvature, where
ν → J0. Evidently, we are interested in the next-to-leading order corrections, since
P µ
those will lead to statistical anisotropies in CMB maps. Schematically, thus, we can
write the large-curvature limit of (25) as:31

C(ˆn, ˆn(cid:48)) = C(ϑ) ± F(ˆn, ˆn(cid:48))

(28)
where the plus\minus signs correspond to BIII\KS cases, respectively, and the func-
tion F is of second order in the quantity (∆η/L), that is, the horizon distance ∆η
in units of the curvature scale L. Since the latter is not known, this ratio appears
as a free parameter in the model. One interesting aspect of the function F is that
it only couples multipoles of equal parities, which is a direct consequence of parity
invariance of metric (1). In order to have an idea of the shape of this function,
we deﬁne its angular power spectrum in terms of oﬀ-diagonal terms of the CMB
covariance matrix:

(cid:96)(cid:88)

m=−(cid:96)

F(cid:96)+∆(cid:96) ≡ 1

2(cid:96) + 1

|(cid:104)a∗

(cid:96)ma(cid:96)+∆(cid:96),m(cid:105)| ,

(29)

which can in turn be directly computed from (28). The strongest signal is expected
to come from the closest neighbors in multipole space. Since multipoles with sepa-
ration ∆(cid:96) = 1 give zero signal due to parity, the next eﬀect results from neighbors

gIf we let (cid:96) = q sin ψ and k = q cos ψ, the integral in ψ can be evaluated analytically, leading to
the famous expression for the 2pcf in real-space. See Ref. 35.

with ∆(cid:96) = 2. We show in Figure (2) a plot of this quantity for two arbitrary choices
of the parameter ∆η/L. It is interesting to note that this function grows smoothly
with growing (cid:96) – a feature which, in observational terms, might alleviate the cosmic
variance of very low multipoles.

3. Conclusions and Perspectives

Unprecedented progress in observational cosmology compel us to explore theoretical
possibilities beyond the simple scenario of an isotropic and spatially ﬂat universe.
However, since the framework of a vanilla ΛCDM cosmology becomes stronger after
each new observational mission, it is important to develop models with new degrees
of freedom that do not spoil known observational results.

In this work we have explored cosmological models which, starting from a general
anisotropic conﬁguration, are rapidly attracted to an FRW-like model, while still
being anisotropic at the level of its spatial curvature. Although we have focused
on the choice of a speciﬁc anisotropic source of matter to obtain this feature, the
simplicity of our model suggest that it might hold in more general scenarios. Since
the background dynamics of these models is exactly the one of a curved FRW
universe, it represents an interesting counter example to our (unjustiﬁed) intuition
that the isotropy of CMB requires an equally isotropic universe.

By developing a proper decomposition of perturbative modes in spaces with
anisotropic curvature, we have shown that linear perturbation theory in shear-free
models is perfectly doable, and leads to interesting phenomenological consequences
– one of which is the existence of a geometrical upper bound to the wavelength of
cosmological perturbations. Assuming that the curvature of the universe lurks just

Extending the ΛCDM model through shear-free anisotropies

11

beyond the current horizon radius, we have computed oﬀ-diagonal signatures that
an anisotropically curved geometry would imprint on the temperature spectrum
of CMB. Such eﬀects could be responsible to some of the known CMB statistical
anomalies, although further investigation is required to clarify this issue.

Finally, we comment on an interesting possibility to extend the results of this
work. A general prediction of anisotropic cosmological metrics, and of shear-free
metrics in particular, is that each polarization of gravitational waves should have
its own dynamics. This will be an interesting signature to look for in the forthcoming
measurements of primordial gravitational wavesh. Moreover, due to the speciﬁcities
of the eigenfunctions and mode decomposition in spaces with anisotropic curvature,
we also expect the tensor-to-scalar ratio to be very diﬀerent in these models.36 Thus,
future measurements of the B-modes in the CMB polarization maps will oﬀer a new
window to constrain both the isotropy and the curvature of the universe.
