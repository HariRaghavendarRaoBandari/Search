ABSTRACT
We have conducted the ﬁrst comprehensive numerical investigation of the relative
velocity distribution of dust particles in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs with a
view to assessing the viability of planetesimal formation via direct collapse in such
environments. The viability depends crucially on the large sizes that are preferentially
collected in pressure maxima produced by transient spiral features (Stokes numbers,
St ∼ 1); growth to these size scales requires that collision velocities remain low enough
that grain growth is not reversed by fragmentation. We show that, for a single sized
dust population, velocity driving by the disc’s gravitational perturbations is only ef-
fective for St > 3, while coupling to the gas velocity dominates otherwise. We develop
a criterion for understanding this result in terms of the stopping distance being of
order the disc scale height. Nevertheless, the relative velocities induced by diﬀerential
radial drift in multi-sized dust populations are too high to allow the growth of silicate
dust particles beyond St ∼ 10−2 or 10−1 (10 cm to m sizes at 30 au), such Stokes num-
bers being insuﬃcient to allow concentration of solids in spiral features. However, for
icy solids (which may survive collisions up to several 10 m s−1), growth to St ∼ 1 (10 m
size) may be possible beyond 30 au from the star. Such objects would be concentrated
in spiral features and could potentially produce larger icy planetesimals/comets by
gravitational collapse. These planetesimals would acquire moderate eccentricities and
remain unmodiﬁed over the remaining lifetime of the disc.

INTRODUCTION

While spectral modeling of protoplanetary discs indicates
that growth of regions up to mm or cm sizes (Ricci et al.
2010),
it has been argued based on models of non-self-
gravitating discs that agglomerative growth beyond these
sizes becomes ineﬃcient due to bouncing, fragmentation
and radial drift (e.g. Brauer et al. 2008; Zsom et al. 2010;
Pinilla et al. 2012; Garaud et al. 2013). How growth pro-
ceeds beyond cm sizes remains one of the biggest uncer-
tainties in current models of planet formation.

Collective phenomena, such as the streaming instabil-
ity (Youdin & Goodman 2005; Johansen et al. 2007), may
provide a possible growth mechanism, but typically this re-
quires large dust-to-gas ratios to be eﬀective (Bai & Stone
2010b), potentially limiting the process until late phases of
disc evolution. Alternatively, in young discs massive enough
to be ‘gravoturbulent’1, the spiral structure may be able

to focus large grains strongly enough that planetesimals
may form directly via gravitational collapse in the dust
layer (Rice et al. 2004, 2006; Gibbons et al. 2012, 2014) and
thus provides a mechanism by which planetesimals may be
formed early within the disc’s lifetime.

The focussing of dust grains requires Stokes numbers
approaching unity, where the Stokes number, St , is the ra-
tio of the stopping time to dynamical time-scale. For discs
massive enough to be self-gravitating, MD ∼ 0.1M⊙, this
requires growth to sizes of several metres at 30 AU. While
growth to St ∼ 1 may occur in less massive discs (and where
St ∼ 1 corresponds to smaller objects, roughly cm-sizes at
30 au in a minimum mass solar nebular disc), gravoturbu-
lence gives rise to perturbations in the velocity of order the
sound speed in both the gas and dust (Gibbons et al. 2012;
Walmswell et al. 2013). Collisions at the sound speed would
inevitably lead to fragmentation, since the sound speed at

shock heating, thus maintaining a Toomre Q parameter close to
unity.

30 au is a few 100 m s−1, well above the typical fragment-
ation threshold for both silicate (∼ 1 m s−1, Güttler et al.
2010) and icy grains (a few 10 m s−1, Wada et al. 2009;
Gundlach & Blum 2015). However, collision velocities can
be considerably lower than the global velocity variation as
particle pairs at small separations will experience similar
perturbations, resulting in only small changes to their rel-
ative velocity. Clearly, in order that planetesimals can form
via direct gravitational collapse of a layer of solid material,
the collision velocity has to remain low enough for particles
to ﬁrst grow to metre sizes and beyond in a low velocity
dispersion environment.

Observationally, the detection of mm to cm-sized grains
in Class I discs (Greaves et al. 2008; Miotello et al. 2014)
has shown that grains can indeed grow to relatively large
sizes while the discs remain massive. Typical mass estimates
for Class I discs are in the range ∼ 0.01M⊙, up to ∼ 0.1 M⊙,
modulo the typical uncertainty in the dust-to-gas ratio and
grain opacity (Eisner 2012), with younger systems (. 1 Myr)
perhaps favouring the higher masses conducive to strong
self-gravity (Mann et al. 2015). Since many of these systems
have large radii (several 100 au), the large mass alone does
not necessarily imply that self-gravity is important; how-
ever, some may well be in the self-gravitating regime (e.g.
WL 12, Miotello et al. 2014). Furthermore, it is possible that
grain growth to ∼ 10 cm sizes may have already occured in
HL Tau (Zhang et al. 2015), a very young system that may
have recently been in the self-gravitating phase, even if the
lack of spiral structure in recent high resolution observa-
tions imply it may no longer be so (ALMA Partnership et al.
2015). The formation of such large pebbles so early in
the disc’s evolution presents exciting prospects for theories
such as the planet formation via the streaming instability
(Youdin & Goodman 2005; Johansen et al. 2007) or pebble
accretion (Lambrechts & Johansen 2012) and perhaps even
dust driven gravitational fragmentation.

In contrast to gravoturbulent discs, the relative velocity
of dust particles in MRI and classical turbulence has been
extensively studied with both theoretical and numerical ap-
proaches. In an astrophysical context, the classical picture
is that eddies with turnover times shorter than the stopping
time of the particles give rise to random kicks that aﬀect
the relative velocity while those with larger turnover times
lead to correlated motion (Völk et al. 1980; Ormel & Cuzzi
2007). Additionally, Pan & Padoan (2010) showed that the
size of the eddies is also important, since eddies larger than
the separation between two particles will cause the particles
to experience similar kicks. Thus the history of the separa-
tion between particle pairs is important for determining the
collision velocity. Numerical simulations have been used to
test these ideas, showing good agreement with the theory
(Cuzzi & Hogan 2003; Bai & Stone 2010a; Carballido et al.
2010; Pan & Padoan 2010, 2013; Pan et al. 2014). The rel-
ative velocity of dust particles in self-gravitating discs has
received much less investigation, although Gibbons et al.
(2012) investigated the distribution of individual particle
velocities in a shearing box. For MRI turbulent discs, the
gravitational acceleration due to MRI density ﬂuctuations
has also been found to be important for large bodies with
St ≫ 1 (Laughlin et al. 2004; Ida et al. 2008).
In this work we ﬁrst present a qualitative picture for
the dynamics of dust particles in self-gravitating discs and

describe how this controls the velocity of collisions between
pairs of particles, focussing primarily on particles with St &
0.3: i.e. those that can be resolved in simulations. We then
use smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations (SPH) to
quantify the collision velocities. We then use our results to
address the prospects for in situ grain growth and the pos-
sibility of planetesimal formation by gravitational collapse
in spiral arms.

In section 2 we discuss the important eﬀects that gov-
ern the motion of dust particles in self-gravitating discs. In
sections 3 and 4 we describe the simulations. Sections 5 and
6 discuss how we measure the collision velocity and the as-
sociated biases. We discuss the collision velocity and con-
centration of identical particles in section 7, while in section
8 the case of diﬀering particle sizes is considered. Finally in
sections 9 and 10 we present our discussion and conclusions.

2 COLLISION VELOCITIES IN
SELF-GRAVITATING DISCS

In order to interpret the simulations presented in this work,
it is useful to ﬁrst consider the factors that aﬀect the velo-
city of dust particles in self-gravitating discs. For simplicity,
throughout this section we focus on the case of identical
particles (mono-disperse case), unless otherwise stated. The
case of diﬀering particle sizes (bi-disperse case) is discussed
in detail in section 8. Our discussion contains a number of
similarities with the classical turbulent case – particularly
that of Pan & Padoan (2010) and Pan & Padoan (2013), in
that a comparison of length scales and particle separations
is central to our argument.

For large particles that are weakly coupled to the gas,
i.e. those with St ≫ 1, the dynamics of a single particle is
well described by a series of perturbations through gravit-
ational scattering by the spiral structure (Walmswell et al.
2013). For a disc with mass 10 per cent of the star mass
and a short cooling time – 5 times the dynamical time-scale
(which represents a region just inside the point at which the
amplitude of spiral features becomes suﬃcient to drive grav-
itational fragmentation in the gas) – the scattering events
were able to drive the eccentricity, e, of planetesimals to typ-
ical values of e ∼ 0.12. This eccentricity in combination with
random phases leads to the crossing of orbits (c.f. caustics
for turbulent gases, Gustavsson & Mehlig 2011) which dom-
inates the collision velocity.

For initial conditions that are dynamically cold, with
particles at similar positions having similar velocities, then
correlations in the motions aﬀect the distributions of eccent-
ricities and relative velocities. Over time these correlations
are broken by variations in the gravitational forces on scales
of order the particle separation. However, since there is little
power on these scales (Boley et al. 2007; Cossins et al. 2009;
Michael et al. 2012), the correlation times can be long.

Using 3D simulations Boley et al. (2007) reported that
the strength of the density perturbations follow the rela-
0)−k, with m0 ∼ 13, and k = 1.5
tion δρ ∼ (m2 + m2
where m is the azimuthal wavenumber. Our 2D simulations

2 Walmswell et al. (2013) neglect drag forces entirely, but eccent-
ricity growth to e ∼ 0.1 is consistent with St > 100 for their
simulation parameters.

show good agreement, but are better ﬁt with m0 = 16
and k = 1.2 to 1.4, showing a slightly slower decrease in
power to small scales. The length scale, λ, associated with
a given mode is λ/R ∼ 1/m, thus m0 = 16 corresponds to
λ/R ≈ 0.06 ≈ 2H/R, showing that the power is predomin-
antly on scales & H. The rapid decrease in power towards
small scales forms the basis for our argument that particles
with small separations will only experience small diﬀerences
in the gravitational perturbations and that the disc scale
height is the natural length scale to associate with this pro-
cess. However, even though the diﬀerence in accelerations
between two closely separated particles is small, if the drag
forces are suﬃciently weak the perturbations may eventually
break the correlations and generate large relative velocities
and signiﬁcant eccentricities, as found by Walmswell et al.
(2013).

For smaller particles, for which the drag force is non-
negligible, the damping provided by drag forces can prevent
the growth of large relative velocities for pairs with small
separations. Since the damping occurs on a stopping time,
perturbations growing on time-scales longer than this are
damped and will not contribute signiﬁcantly to the relat-
ive velocity. For a collision occurring at velocity ∆v, we can
deﬁne a characteristic distance λstop, which is the typical dis-
tance that the particles cross within a stopping time prior
to the collision. Perturbations that vary on scales much lar-
ger than this will have similar eﬀects on the velocity of both
particles, but only a weak eﬀect on their relative velocity.
Therefore, it is natural to compare the driving scale of the
perturbations, λd, to the characteristic stopping distances
of colliding particles

λstop = ∆vts,

(1)

where ∆v is the typical relative velocity. By equating λd and
λstop, we can determine a critical relative velocity,

vcrit =

λd
H

St −1cs.

(2)

Since there is little power in the density ﬁeld on scales < H,
we expect that once the typical collision velocity is smal-
ler than St −1cs driving by self-gravity should become in-
eﬃcient. If only driving by self-gravity is possible then de-
creasing St further should lead to a rapid drop in the typ-
ical collision velocity. However, as St decreases and the drag
forces increases, the coupling of the dust velocity to the gas
velocity becomes stronger and driving by ﬂuctuations in the
gas velocity on scales 6 λstop becomes more important. In
section 7 we demonstrate the transition from gravitational
driving to driving by drag and ﬁnd the corresponding Stokes
number at which this occurs.

The bi-disperse case is further complicated by the dif-
fering terminal velocity of particles with diﬀerent stopping
times, vterm = ts∇P/ρ. The diﬀerent terminal velocities res-
ult in diﬀerent azimuthal and radial drift velocities even for
axisymmetric discs. For small particles (St ≪ 1) with very
diﬀerent stopping times this could give rise to a mean colli-
sion velocity that is larger than the typical velocity disper-
sion within a given size bin. For large particles (St ≫ 1), the
relative radial and azimuthal drift velocity is small, but the
velocity dispersion is large (due to eﬃcient driving). These
behaviours are tested in section 8.

Collisions in self-gravitating discs

3 NUMERICAL METHODS

We have run two-dimensional smoothed particle hydro-
dynamics simulations of self-gravitating discs using a mod-
iﬁed version of the gadget-2 code (Springel 2005). Below
we brieﬂy describe the improvements made to the hydro-
dynamics and the implementation of dust dynamics.

Kernel – We use the Wendland C 6 kernel, which is
stable against the pairing instability and improves conver-
gence in the presence of strong shear (Dehnen & Aly 2012).
We deﬁne the smoothing length, h as the full extent of the
kernel, as in Springel (2005). We set the smoothing lengths
to give a constant number of neighbours in two dimensions,

πh2

i Xj

W (|rij|, hi) = Nngb,

(3)

where W is the kernel function, rij = ri − rj, hi is the
smoothing length of the ith particle and Nngb is the desired
number of neighbours. Typically we use Nngb = 50 or 100
to reduce noise and ensure an accurate density estimate.3

Gradients – Additionally we make use of the integral
approximation to kernel gradients (García-Senz et al. 2012;
Rosswog 2015). The gradient of a quantity f is given by

∇kf (r) = Xj

the lower indices denote the particles. The matrix C kd =
(τ −1)kd, where

The quantities inside the second sum in Equation 4 replace
directly the ∇W terms that appear in the equations of mo-
tion. SPH formulations based on the integral approxima-
tion produce less numerical noise, better resolve instabilities
and are not sensitive to the underlying particle distribution,
thus preserving symmetry more accurately. For details see
García-Senz et al. (2012) or Rosswog (2015). Similarly, in
Booth et al. (2015) we found integral gradients introduce
less numerical noise into the dust particle velocities.

torques and Reynolds

Viscosity – To ensure that artiﬁcial dissipation does
not interfere with the angular momentum transport by
gravitational
stress we use a
Cullen & Dehnen (2010) type viscosity switch to reduce vis-
cosity away from shocks. Additionally we employ the noise
trigger of Rosswog (2015) to help maintain particle order
in the presence of strong shear. Since the shocks in self-
gravitating discs are typically weak, we use a higher than
normal value of the maximum viscosity parameter, αmax = 3
to ensure suﬃcient entropy generation at shock fronts. Away
from shocks the scheme produces α < 0.1, i.e. less viscosity
than is often used with ﬁxed α prescriptions (Lodato & Rice
2004; Rice et al. 2004, 2006; Meru & Bate 2011, 2012).

Conductivity – We employ artiﬁcial conductivity as in

Price (2012) to smooth jumps at contact discontinuities.

Self-gravity – For self-gravity we use a Barnes & Hut
(1986) tree with a relative opening criterion, as described in
Springel (2005). We soften the gravitational force on scales

3 Nngb = 50, corresponds to η = 4, for η as deﬁned in Price 2012.

smaller than H = cs/Ω to take into account the fact that
we are modelling a 3D dimensional structure in 2D. This is
necessary since otherwise the gravitational force on scales
smaller than H is over-estimated, which leads to the form-
ation of artiﬁcial small scale structures and can lead to
spurious fragmentation (Müller et al. 2012; Young & Clarke
2015). Following Müller et al. (2012), we soften the force by
integrating the force felt by each particle over the vertical
structure of the disc, which we approximate by a Gaussian.
For full details, see Appendix A.

Dust Dynamics – We include dust particles in the test-
particle limit, which feel gravitational and drag forces, but
do not aﬀect the motion of the gas. The dust acceleration is
given by

dvd
dt

= −

vd − vg

ts

+ g,

(6)

where vd, vg are the dust and gas velocities, ts is the
stopping time, and g if the gravitational acceleration. As
in Booth et al. (2015), we use a semi-implicit update for
the dust velocity as part of the kick-drift-kick scheme in
gadget-2, where the velocity is set using the analytical
solution for the drag force, under the assumption that the
gas velocity, gravitational acceleration and stopping time
remain constant throughout the time step. These quantities
are calculated by interpolating the gas properties at the loc-
ation of the dust particle, with the dust smoothing length
calculated via Equation 3, summing over neighbouring gas
particles to ensure suﬃcient neighbours. The robustness of
the scheme has been demonstrated in a wide range of ideal-
ized test problems Booth et al. (2015).

For the drag force, we set the stopping time using either
a constant Stokes number, ts = St Ω−1, or a scale-free ap-
proximation to the Epstein regime. In the Epstein regime the
stopping time for spherical grains is ts = ρss/(ρgvT ), where

ρs, s, ρg and vT = pπ/8cs are the internal density of the

grain, the grain size, the gas density and the mean thermal
velocity of the gas respectively. Since in the mid-plane,
ρg ∼ Σ/H and H = cs/Ω, where Σ is the surface density
and cs is the sound speed, we see that St = tsΩ ∝ s/Σ, with
no dependence on the sound speed. Therefore we can include
the drag force in a scale free way by taking ts = St Σ0/(ΣΩ),
where Σ0 is the the surface density in the absence of grav-
itational perturbations.

We have neglected the eﬀects of collisions between dust
grains on the dust dynamics, since for typical parameters the
time between collisions, tc, is much longer than the stopping
time, ts,

Cooling – We assume a β cooling law, ˙u = −u/tc, where
tc = β/Ω. We consider β in the range 7 6 β 6 25, to
investigate the dependence of the collision velocity on the
strength of the gravitational perturbation, while remaining
safely in the range in which fragmentation does not occur in
2D (Young & Clarke 2015) as well as minimizing the inﬂu-
ence of artiﬁcial viscosity heating on the spiral structure.

4 DISC MODEL AND INITIAL CONDITIONS

For the gas disc model we take a central mass M⋆ = 1 and
disc mass MD = 0.1. For the disc structure we use an ini-
tial surface density proﬁle Σ ∝ R−2, between Rin = 1 and
Rout = 5, which ensures the same resolution in h/H every-
where. We set up the disc with an initial Toomre parameter
Q = 2, and evolve it for 103 inner dynamical times, ap-
proximately nine cooling times at the outer edge, allowing
the self-gravitating structure to reach a steady state before
introducing the dust.

The dust particles are given an initially uniform density
with the same Σ ∝ R−2 density distribution as the gas. The
simulations have then been run for a further 100 to 300
inner dynamical times, until the dust velocity distribution
has stopped varying. For our canonical simulations we use
106 particles per phase. We use the same number of gas
neighbours for both the gas and dust particles, NNGB = 50,
which corresponds to h/H ≈ 0.2. It is worth noting that our
chosen kernel, the Wendland C6, is 1.35 times wider than
the commonly used Cubic Spline kernel, such that sound
waves with wavelength λ & 0.6H should be well resolved
(Dehnen & Aly 2012). Additionally we have run some high-
resolution simulations using 4 × 106 and 16 × 106 particles
per phase, in which we use a higher NNGB = 100 to further
reduce noise.

Since the velocities of particles with small initial phase
space separations remain correlated for many orbits, care
needs to be taken to ensure the initial conditions do not
aﬀect the measured relative velocity distribution. This cor-
relation time will inevitably be resolution dependent since
small wavelength perturbations are responsible for breaking
these correlations. Rather than trying to model the processes
responsible (e.g. gravitational interactions between planetes-

simulation with 4 × 106 particles per phase and cooling parameter β = 10, shown 200 inner dynamical time-scales (Ω−1) after the dust
was introduced. The spatial range covers the whole disc from −5 to 5 and the dust density is scaled to give the same background density
as the gas. The overall dust morphology is similar to the gas in both cases, but with narrower spiral features for St ∼ 1. The majority
of dust particles are found in regions where the dust density is enhanced relative to the average ΣD/ΣG.

imals for St ≫ 1), we calculate the steady-state velocity
distribution, once the initial correlations have been lost. In
doing so we neglect a possible low velocity component of rel-
ative velocity distribution that may play a role in the growth
of grains, but are able to determine the frequency of high
velocity collisions that will be responsible for fragmentation.
However, since the formation process itself may take several
dynamical times, it is likely that highly correlated initial
conditions are not representative of the distribution of ve-
locities that the dust is initially formed with. Similar non-
convergence at the smallest resolvable scales is seen in tur-
bulence driven by the streaminng instability (Carrera et al.
2015).

We therefore choose our initial conditions in such a way
that the steady state distribution of dust velocities is reached
as rapidly as possible. Since the particle pairs that take the
longest to reach steady state are those with small separa-
tions, it is sensible to break the initial correlation of particles
that are initially close together. The simplest way to achieve
this is to add noise to the initial particle velocity, thus en-
suring that particles close together in position space have a
signiﬁcant separation in the full phase space. For our stand-
ard set-up, we set the initial dust velocity to the local gas
velocity, on top of which we add a random velocity of or-
der the sound speed. In adding an initial velocity dispersion
we now have to integrate for long enough to ensure that
the measured velocity distribution is not just an artefact of
the initial velocity distribution. For tightly coupled particles
integrating for relatively few dynamical times is suﬃcient
(though in practice we do not use less than 100 inner dy-
namical times). For the more weakly coupled particles, the
velocity dispersion grows above the initial velocity disper-
sion within a few 10s of dynamical time-scales, therefore it
is suﬃcient to integrate until a steady state is reached and
the velocity dispersion saturates.

The eﬀects of the initial conditions on the distribution

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2015)

of relative velocities are demonstrated in Figure 1, which
shows the relative velocities for simulations at resolutions of
1 × 106 and 4 × 106 particles per phase and St = 10 (for an
explanation of how the velocity dispersion is calculated, see
section 5.). At 1×106 particles per phase we ﬁnd that the ve-
locity correlations are lost before 200 inner dynamical times,
resulting in the same distributions independent of whether
noise was added, or whether the initial velocity was set to
the gas velocity or the local Keplerian velocity. However, for
4 × 106 this is no longer the case and the simulations with
correlated initial conditions produce distributions biased to
lower velocities.

By sub-sampling the dust in the 4× 106 particle simula-
tion to the same resolution as the 106 particle simulation we
see that the eﬀect is not merely due to sampling the distribu-
tion on smaller scales, since it only partially accounts for the
diﬀerence, but that the correlation time is also longer. This
is because the high resolution simulations have less power
on small scales due to reduced noise, which means the cor-
relation time is longer at small separations. It is important
to note that the although we measure the velocity dispersion
on these small scales, the velocity dispersion is driven by ef-
fects on larger scales (λd > λsam, see section 6) so the steady
state velocity dispersion is correctly reproduced. However,
the correlation times at small separations are not. For this
reason our ‘noisy’ initial conditions, which remove the ef-
fects of the smallest scales and save computational time are
the best choice.

In Figure 2 we show the gas and dust surface density
for St = 3 and St = 10, which provides a useful reference
for interpretation of the collision velocities. The dust surface
density scale is arbitrary due to the use of the test particle
limit; for reference we scale the density such that the un-
perturbed gas and dust surface density are equal. The range
St = 3 and St = 10 bridges the region where the width of
the dust spiral features is the same as those in the gas, with

to higher order terms in the background velocity.

spirals it is clear that these spirals interact with each other
forming kinks in the linear structures.

5 MEASURING THE COLLISION VELOCITY

If we denote the probability that two particles separated by
a distance δr have a relative velocity between v and v + δv as
P (δr, v)δv, then the probability density of relative velocities,
p(v)δv, is given by

(8)

δr→r0

P (δr, v)g(δr)δv,

p(v)δv ∝ lim
where g(δr) is the probability that two particles are separ-
ated by a distance δr and the constant of proportionality is
chosen such the the probability normalises to unity. Here we
have neglected the formal spatial dependence of these quant-
ities since we will average over the disc anyway. The limit r0
should be twice the particle size, but since this is much smal-
ler than typical ﬂow scales (mm or cm compared with AU),
it is safe to consider r0 ≈ 0. Taking the limit δr → 0, then
g(δr) is proportional to the density. For suﬃciently small δr,
P (δr, v) and g(δr) are approximately independent of r. Since
g ∝ ρ, we can measure the relative velocity distribution,
p(v), by choosing particles the same way as they are chosen
in the density calculation, i.e. using all particle pairs formed
from the neighbours within the smoothing volume. To get a
good estimate of the distribution one ideally wants to be in
the limit of a large number of neighbours and small sampling
volume, a regime that is limited by computational expense.
It is important to make the distinction that the diﬀerential
collision rate, Γ(v), is diﬀerent from the relative distribution
measured from the simulation, p(v), since the time between
collisions tc = (nσv)−1, depends on the velocity. Therefore,

the rate of collisions at a given velocity obeys Γ(v) ∝ vp(v),
which we use for calculating the typical collision velocity.
Some improvement can be made over the direct estim-
ate by noting that the relative velocity of two particles sep-
arated by a distance δr includes both a term from the phys-
ical velocity dispersion, and a contribution from the back-
ground ﬂow. For example, Keplerian shear introduces a ve-
locity gradient into the disc, which produces a velocity dif-
ference between two particles of order δr
H cs. As long as a
suﬃciently large number of particles is used to measure the
velocity gradient, it can be safely subtracted when calculat-
ing the collision velocities. This has been veriﬁed directly for
the case of diﬀering particle sizes, in which we ﬁnd the same
velocity dispersion independently of which particle size is
used to remove the background gradient (see section 8). We
measure the gradient using the integral approximation for
gradients (Equation 4) and use the corrected relative velo-
city in measuring the p.d.f. For the relative velocity we use

the 1D equivalent r.m.s. velocity, p∆v · ∆v/2, rather than
the projected velocity, ∆v · ∆x/|∆x|, since it appears to
be more robust to subtracting oﬀ the background gradient.
This choice results in p(∆v) ∝ ∆v for small ∆v, rather than
p(∆v) ≈ const. We ﬁnd the diﬀerence in the mean velocities
is minor, which are a factor of 2 higher for the r.m.s. case.
To ﬁnd the optimal sampling volume, we computed
the velocity p.d.f. for a variety of number of neighbours,
NNGB, the results of which are shown in Figure 3 for St =
10. The behaviour of the measured p.d.f. diﬀers for small
(NNGB . 100) and large volumes. For small volumes the
p.d.f. is aﬀected by a noisy gradient estimate, which results
in a broader distribution as the background velocity is not
removed accurately. For large NNGB, there are two eﬀects.
Firstly, as NNGB increases the contribution to the p.d.f. from
particles at the smallest separations is down-weighted. This
reduces the width of the low velocity tail in the p.d.f, which
is enhanced by particles that are very close to each other and
therefore have had very similar histories. For particles with
large separations, higher order terms in background velocity
become important for NNGB > 200 and St = 10, which leads
to a change in the mean collision velocity, proportional to
NNGB (or h2), of order a few per cent. Figure 3 shows that
the optimal choice will be both a function of resolution and
St, but we consider NNGB = 200 to be a good compromise.

6 SAMPLING SCALE

In measuring the velocity from simulations we introduce a
sampling scale, λsam, into the problem in addition to the
stopping distance, λstop, and driving scale, λd. To measure
velocity dispersion we need

λsam < min(λd, λstop),

(9)

and we have λd ∼ H. The ﬁrst inequality can be satisﬁed
provided the simulation is well enough resolved (λsam ≪ H).
λstop is however ∆vts and so there will always be some
particles in the tail of the relative velocity distribution for
which ∆vts < the particle separation, r (< λsam). We term
these particles ‘unresolved’ because, in the absence of driv-
ing by small scales, the measured relative velocity of such
particles with respect to a reference particle is an upper limit

that are marked as resolved, while red points show unresolved
pairs. The solid lines denote means for resolved/unresolved pairs
and the black dashed lines are included as approximate bounding
boxes for the N = 106 case to guide the eye. Increasing the res-
olution causes resolved pairs to move to lower separations at the
same velocity; while unresolved pairs move to both lower separa-
tions and lower velocities.

since in this case the relative motion will be further damped
before the particles collide4.

For any reference particle, we can sort the NNGB pair-
wise interactions within λsam according to whether ∆vts < r
(unresolved) or ∆vts > r. If λd ≫ λsam then we do not ex-
pect a signiﬁcant spatial gradient of the velocity of resolved
particles within λsam (after having subtracted oﬀ the con-
tribution from the mean velocity ﬁeld). We illustrate such
a case in the right panels of Figure 4 where we see that
by construction the resolved particles in this case have a
higher velocity dispersion than the unresolved. Increasing
the resolution clearly only aﬀects the separation of resolved
pairs, while the number of unresolved pairs decreases. The
slight lack of low velocity dispersion pairs at small separ-
ations hints at a density dependence of the velocity distri-
bution, with the higher velocity dispersion collisions more
probable in higher density environments.

When we present our results we will (for each value
of the Stokes number) present particle velocity dispersions
considering only the resolved particles and also those in-
cluding the unresolved too - evidently the fraction of unre-
solved particles varies with both Stokes number and resol-
ution (λsam). The way that such plots (Figure 7) should be

Figure 5. The relative velocity and separation between ﬁve ran-

All particles have St = 10. It is clear that their separation a
few dynamical times ago (−∆t ∼ ts) is a better predictor of the
particles relative velocity than their current separations, which
are all similar.

interpreted is that the resolved values represent a true rep-
resentation of the velocity dispersion of that particle subset;
in cases where this value is signiﬁcantly above the ‘total’
value, then the latter is an overestimate of the true velo-
city dispersion because of the important contribution from
unresolved interactions.

In the limit of low ts we also have to consider the possib-
ility of driving of velocity dispersion on small scales (< λsam)
due to the relative motion of individual gas particles to
which such dust particles are tightly coupled. In this case
we expect this purely numerical eﬀect to introduce a gradi-
ent in relative velocities within λsam. The upper left panel of
Figure 4 shows such a case in which there is clear gradient
in the collision velocity, and that resolved particles tend to
be close to the target particle and also at lower velocities.
This can result in the magnitude of unresolved velocity dis-
persion exceeding that of the resolved particles, which we
use in section 7 to identify the contribution from noise.

7 MONO-DISPERSE CASE

We ﬁrst examine in detail the idealized case of equal-sized
particles, thereby neglecting eﬀects that arise due to diﬀer-
ences in stopping time, such as radial and azimuthal drift.
Since in a smooth disc equal-sized particles have zero relat-
ive velocity the mono-disperse case is ideal for determining
the random component of the collision velocity. In section 8
we discuss the case of collisions between diﬀerent particle
sizes.

In Figure 5 we show the separation and relative velocity
between pairs of St = 10 particles as a function of time into
the past. For each of 5 randomly selected particles we show
the history of the separation of the particle’s current nearest
neighbour. It is clear that while all particle pairs have a sim-
ilar separations at the current time, they have quite diﬀerent
relative velocities. The relative velocity is much more accur-

ately predicted by the separation of the particles 3–10Ω−1
ago, i.e. within of order ts. This neatly demonstrates our
argument above that the spatial separation of particles is
important for determining the relative velocity of particle
pairs, and also that information about the particles separa-
tion far into the past has been lost. We will thus discuss the
measured collision velocities in terms of this model in the
following sections.

7.1 Dependence on Stokes Number

Figure 6 shows the distribution of relative velocities for
St > 1; this plot contains only resolved particles (unre-
solved particles are a minority component at these Stokes
numbers). At low velocity, the distribution shows a p(v) ∝ v
behaviour, which is a consequence of using the r.m.s. rel-
ative velocity. (The lowest Stokes number runs, St = 0.1
and St = 0.3, are not shown as the velocity distribution
becomes dominated by unresolved pairs.) Even at large St
we ﬁnd that velocity distribution is not well ﬁt by a Gaus-
sian and that for St = 100 we ﬁnd a reasonable match
to p(v) ∼ v exp(−C|v|1.3). Surprisingly, this is close to
the distribution of dust collision velocities in turbulent gas,
p(v) ∼ exp(−C|v|4/3) (Gustavsson et al. 2008), despite the
additional driving by gravitational forces.
The velocity distribution for St 6 3 shows a power-
law tail to large velocities that is due to collisions involving
particles at low densities in the simulation. Even though
there are relatively few particles in low density regions (es-
pecially for small St ), they can overlap dense regions con-
taining many particles and thus make a signiﬁcant contribu-
tion to the relative velocity distribution. Since these particles
can have separations larger than a scale height the relative
velocity may change signiﬁcantly before a collision occurs.
Furthermore, the gradient subtraction process actually in-
creases the strength of these tails, most likely because the
large number of closely associated particles in the high dens-
ity region biases the gradient estimate. We therefore suggest
that they are unphysical, and have found that if we exclude

collisions in which either of the particles are in low density
environments (ΣD/ΣG less than the global average, which
we deﬁne as ΣD/ΣG = 1 by scaling the dust density) then
these tails are reduced (right hand panel, Figure 6) and the
distributions show a similar cut oﬀ to the high St distribu-
tions. The excluded fraction of particles is greatest for the
high St cases (less than 10 per cent), but we ﬁnd even in this
case it makes little diﬀerence to distribution apart from the
high velocity tails. However, particular choices of the cut-
oﬀ density, make very little diﬀerence to the results because
the dust particles are preferentially found in features with
ΣD/ΣG > 1.

Figure 6 also indicates for each Stokes number the velo-
city scale at which λstop = H and we see that for St > 10 the
majority of collisions occur in the regime where λstop > H.
This is consistent with velocity driving on a scale H, as is
expected for gravitational driving (see the gas surface dens-
ity snapshot in the lower left of Figure 9 which indicates the
broad striations on scale H).

The median collision velocity, ∆vmed,

is shown in
Figure 7, and is showing shows signs of saturating towards 2
to 3cs by St = 100. In the absence of drag, the sound speed
aﬀects the velocity distribution only in as far as it controls
gravitational perturbations from the disc: these are jointly
set by β (Cossins et al. 2009) and by the disc surface density,
Σ, which is related to cs via the constancy of the Toomre Q
parameter. For St > 3 we see that ∆vmed is converged even
at the lowest resolution, which is expected since λstop ≫ h.
Between St = 3 and St = 100 we ﬁnd ∆vmed ∝ St 1/2,
the same dependence that is found for particles in turbu-
lence in the inertial range (e.g. Ormel & Cuzzi 2007). This
behaviour may indicate that the particles are undergoing
a random walk in velocity space, which would produce a
˙Q, that is in-
∆v2
dependent of ∆vmed and ts. As discussed above, this is as
expected for gravitational driving of particles in this range
of St for which λstop > H.

med ∝ ˙Qts behaviour for a heating rate,

Turning now to the behaviour at lower St , we see from
Figures 7 and 8 that ∆vmed is only approximately converged

verged velocity distribution would require > 109 particles.
This is because λstop is a very strong function of St since
both ∆vmed and ts depend on St . We also see from Fig-
ures 6 and 8 that the velocity distribution broadens (relat-
ive to its form at high St ) at a Stokes number of around
3 and that a signiﬁcant fraction of particles have velocit-
ies for which λstop < H, which is an unexpected outcome
in the case of gravitational driving. This behaviour is ex-
plained by examination of the lower right panel of Figure 9,

which shows regions of localised structure in the gas vorti-
city ﬁeld on scales < H. These regions are associated with
locations where spiral arms cross (as can be seen in the dis-
tribution of St = 1 particles in the upper left panel) and
these drive locally high values of the velocity dispersion of
such particles (upper right panel of Figure 9). We emphas-
ise a qualitative shift in particle driving at around St = 3,
where λstop = H. At higher Stokes number, all particles
are subject to gravitational driving and the velocity ﬁeld re-
ﬂects a balance between such driving and gas drag. At lower
Stokes number, the dominant driving is also by drag forces
whose strength is determined by the local gas velocity ﬁeld.
The majority of particles which are trapped in spiral fea-
tures experience a quiescent velocity ﬁeld and have very low
mutual velocities which we struggle to resolve. A small frac-
tion of particles however experience strong driving in regions
of high vorticity where spiral features cross. We are able to
measure a converged median collision velocity for particles
in the latter category at St = 1 and are approaching con-
vergence for this particle subset at St = 0.3 (triangles in
Figure 7).

At St = 0.1 we ﬁnd that the relative velocity of re-
solved particles is smaller than that of the unresolved ones.
The explanation for this is that the resolved particles are
on average closer than the unresolved ones and the reason
that these particles are ﬂagged as ‘resolved’ is thus due to
their small separation. This results in a lower than average
velocities since the particles are suﬃciently close that they
share the same gas neighbours and see the same realisations
of the noise. This inversion of the resolved and unresolved
velocity dispersions is a clear signature of noise induced by
jitter of individual gas particles. This eﬀect becomes less
important at higher Stokes number because the noise is av-
eraged over more gas particles and more time-steps. We are
conﬁdent that this interpretation is correct since the same
behaviour can be clearly seen in test problems (see Fig. 12
of Booth et al. 2015), where the velocity dispersion can be
unambiguously determined to be due to noise. By extrapol-
ating ∆vmed from St = 0.1 and St = 0.3 it is clear that noise
is not contributing to ∆vmed at St = 1.

Since for St < 3 we ﬁnd the presence of both high and
low velocity collisions, we also consider the fraction of colli-
sions that occur above a given threshold, which is important
for examining the growth and fragmentation of dust grains.
The results are shown in Figure 10. At St = 1 more than 30
per cent of collisions occur at velocities greater than 0.1cs
and it is unlikely that this drops below 10 per cent until
St . 0.1. However, at St = 1 the fraction of collisions with
velocities greater than cs (∼ 10∆vmed) is less than 1 per
cent, due to the exponential tail in the velocity distribution.
Even though a small fraction of high velocity collisions
occur, if particles can avoid environments in which large
collision velocities occur then it may also be possible for
particles to avoid fragmentation for long periods of time.
We have investigated this by examining the distribution of
delay times between particles entering high velocity disper-
sion environments. This was done by identifying the local
velocity dispersion of each particle in simulation snapshots
separated by an inner dynamical time scale (Ω(Rin)−1),
once a ∆t had been found it was scaled to the local dy-
namical time-scale. We limit the investigation to particles
within the range r = [2, 3], where the eﬀective time resol-

The highest velocity dispersion environments are associated with regions where the narrow spiral features in the density cross. In those
regions where the spirals merely closely approach the velocity dispersion can be considerably smaller. The particles ﬂagged as in low
density regions have been excluded from the velocity dispersion calculation, resulting in σv = 0 in the lowest density regions. Bottom:

Figure 10. Fraction of collisions that occur above a given velocity
threshold for diﬀerent Stokes numbers.

ution of the snapshots is 0.2 to 0.35Ω−1. The distributions
are shown in Figure 11. We ﬁnd that at large ∆t, the dis-
tribution is in good agreement with an exponential decay.
For ∆t . 3Ω−1 the distribution is clearly enhanced relative
to the tail. For the range of St considered here, the typical
delay times are considerably shorter than the collision time
(tc > 104Ω−1 at St = 3, Equation 7). Although particle
trapping in spiral features may signiﬁcantly reduce the col-
lision time (for St ∼ 1), it is likely that the a given dust
particle samples the disc-averaged collision velocity distri-
butions fairly evenly.

Finally, although the focus of our analysis has been the
quantiﬁcation of the velocity dispersion in relation to solid
growth by collisions, we also brieﬂy consider the issue of
planetesimal assembly by direct gravitational collapse of the
dust. For dust self-gravity to become strong enough that
dust driven collapse to form planetesimals to occur the dust
must be concentrated in regions where the local dust dens-
ity is comparable, or higher than the local gas density. We
ﬁnd that the factor ∼ 100 enhancement required for this to
happen is limited to the range 0.3 . St . 3 (Figure 12).
The eﬀects of dust self-gravity, which have been neglected
here may increase this range slightly, but equally once the
dust mass becomes locally comparable to the gas mass the
drag force will weaken (due to a factor of (1 + ρD/ρG)−1 in
the stopping time), which may also reduce the viable range
of St for St < 1.

7.2 Dependence on β

Our canonical value of the cooling time β = 10 repres-
ents cooling just inside the boundary for gas phase frag-
mentation, where the perturbations are strong. Due to the
strong dependence of β on radius (β ∝ r−4.5, Raﬁkov 2005;
Clarke & Lodato 2009), the surface density perturbations
will be weaker at smaller radii, which will aﬀect the col-
lision velocities. In order to investigate this we have run
simulations in which we varied the cooling time, (βΩ)−1 (at
resolutions of 106 and 4× 106 particles per phase). We have
measured the velocity dispersion for particles with St = 10

and St = 3, for which the driving scale should be well re-
solved.

The results for the velocity dispersion averaged over 50
inner dynamical times are shown in Figure 13, along with
the r.m.s. gas velocity. We also show curves of β−1/2, the de-
pendency expected for the r.m.s. gas velocity perturbation
when heating by weak shocks (∝ v2) balances cooling (∝
β−1). This dependence was predicted by Clarke & Lodato
(2009) in order to explain the ∆Σ/Σ ∝ β−0.5 dependence
found in the simulations of Cossins et al. (2009). We ﬁnd a
slightly steeper dependence of the r.m.s. gas velocity at low
resolution, but a shallower dependence at high resolution.
Figure 14 shows that diﬀerences may partly be accounted for
by variations in cs, which increases with β, with the Toomre
Q parameter showing similar dependence. We note that a
slight increase in Q with β should be expected since Q con-
trols the strength of the self-gravity and thus by regulating
Q the disc is able to maintain an equilibrium temperature
for diﬀerent β. However, the behaviour for β & 20 is likely
to be aﬀected by artiﬁcial viscosity since in 3D shearing box
simulations Shi & Chiang (2014) found only a very weak de-
pendence of cs on β for β > 10.

Turning now to the median collision velocity for dust
grains, we also see a behaviour that is broadly similar to,
although slightly steeper than, the β−0.5 behaviour exepcted
for gas. Interpretting this in terms of a random walk that
produces ∆vmed ∝ St 1/2, we see that the rate of excitation
˙Q ∼ β−1 ∝ (∆Σ/Σ)2. The fact that we see similar behaviour
for the dust and gas is indicative of a single mechanism
being responsible for driving both of them – for the gas this
mechanism is spiral density waves that contain an energy
density contained ∝ (∆Σ/Σ)2 Cossins et al. (2009). Thus we
suggest that it is the energy available in these spiral waves
that is responsible for exciting the dust collision velocities,
at least for the case λstop > H.

7.3 Density dependent Epstein drag law

We now revisit the collision velocity with a prescription that
takes into account the explicit density dependence of the
Epstein drag law instead of ﬁxed Stokes number (i.e. we
allow the Stokes number to vary according to the inverse
ratio of the local surface density to its azimuthally averaged
value). As described in section 3, under the approximation of
vertical hydrostatic equilibrium the Stokes number depends
only on the surface density. To ensure self-similarity we have
normalized the surface density to background (unperturbed)
density, to keep the same Stokes number at all locations
while including the density dependence.

The eﬀect that the drag law makes on the relative velo-
city can be seen in Figure 15. For all Stokes numbers St > 1,
the diﬀerences in the distributions are small and decreasing
as the Stokes number increases, with the diﬀerence in the
mean velocity less than 20 per cent at St = 1. In all cases
the mean collision velocity is slightly smaller when using the
Epstein drag law, but the diﬀerence is small enough that the
drag law is unlikely to have a large eﬀect on the outcome of
collisions derived from simulations. We interpret this result
as being due to the fact that stronger perturbations are as-
sociated with higher density regions and the stopping time
in these regions will be smaller for the Epstein drag case
than the average Stokes number case.

8 BI-DISPERSE CASE

We now turn our attention to the case of collisions between
dust particles of diﬀerent sizes. To ensure that we are com-
paring particles in identical environments we have run a pair
of simulations using a gas resolution of 106 particles and dust
resolutions of 2.5× 105 particles per phase and 106 particles
per phase at Stokes number St = {0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100}
and St = {1, 3, 10, 30} respectively. The collision velocity is
then determined for each size by ﬁnding the neighbouring
particles of a given size and subtracting oﬀ the gradient as
before. This process is not symmetric, as only the gradient
in one particle size is taken into account, but we ﬁnd a less
than 10 per cent diﬀerence on swapping the particle sizes,
which conﬁrms that the subtraction eﬀectively removes the
background velocity ﬁeld.

The results of these simulations are shown in Figure 16.
As before, the behaviour can be broadly split into two cat-
egories. For particles with λstop = ∆vmedts & H (St & 3)

the results are consistent with the relative velocity of these
particles being determined by the diﬀerence between two
random velocity distributions, as expected for particles that
undergo many gravitational perturbations within a stop-
ping time. This result holds even when one of the species
has λstop ≪ H since the collision velocity is dominated by
the collision velocity of the larger species. These results re-
ﬂect those found for particles with St > 1 in turbulent me-
dia (Völk et al. 1980; Ormel & Cuzzi 2007; Pan & Padoan
2010).

When both particles have λstop . H, the behaviour is
diﬀerent. For nearly identical particles, the velocity is dom-
inated by the (approximately) mono-disperse velocity dis-
persion and rapidly decreases in strength for λstop < H.
However, for particles with diﬀerent Stokes number the
relative velocity increases with increasing size diﬀerence.
This behaviour is driven by the diﬀerent terminal velocit-
ies between particles of diﬀering sizes ∆vterm = (ts,1 −

the local Keplerian value, ηvK ≈ 1.4 × 10−3vK (≈ 0.05cs)
is approximately 7 m s−1 at 30 au (cf. ∼ 50 m s−1 through-
out the minimum mass solar nebular, Johansen et al. 2014).
From the simulations we ﬁnd the dust-gas relative velocity
is 3.5 × 10−2, 7.5 × 10−2 and 17 × 10−2cs for St = 0.1, 0.3
and 1, suggesting that density perturbations result in drift
velocities a few times larger than the background disc.
Since the surface density perturbations, ∆Σ/Σ ∼ 1/√β,

we can expect the radial drift of the background disc to dom-
inate the spiral perturbations for β & 100, thus limiting the
region in which the self-gravitating structure aﬀects small
grains. Once the radial drift of the background disc domin-
ates the relative drift in the spirals we can expect the self-
gravitating spiral structure to be no longer able to trap dust
particles, even at St = 1. This appears consistent with the
results of Gibbons et al. (2012), in so far as they only ran
one simulation at the very edge of the region of vr–β space
in which radial drift should be important. That simulation
showed a mild suppression of the concentration of dust in
spiral features by radial drift, supporting our argument.

9 DISCUSSION

We have run smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations
of dust particles in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs,
with the aim of understanding whether the conditions for
direct gravitational collapse can occur in dust trapped in
the spiral arms of the disc, or whether collisions between
dust grains lead to fragmentation, thus preventing growth
to large enough sizes. To this end we have measured the col-
lision velocity between pairs of particles for a range of sizes,
along with the density enhancement.

We ﬁnd that while gas self-gravity can drive velocity dis-
persions of order the sound speed in weakly coupled particles
(St > 10), for St . 3 the largest scales that can eﬀectively
drive the velocity dispersion, λd, drop below the disc scale
height, H. Once this happens, driving by the disc gravity
becomes ineﬃcient, and the dominant driving mechanism
comes from the gas drag. We ﬁnd that at this transition the
fraction of collisions occurring at velocities exceeding a signi-
ﬁcant fraction of the sound speed drops rapidly. In addition
we see that the highest velocity collisions become associated
with the crossing of spiral features in the dust density, while
collisions between particles within the same spirals occur at
considerably lower velocity.

We ﬁnd that particles are eﬀectively trapped in spiral
features, leading to high local dust to gas ratios, in the range
of Stokes number ∼ 0.3–3. These results are in good agree-
ment with those of Gibbons et al. (2012), who also found
that particles with St = 0.1 or St = 10 are not eﬀectively
trapped by the spiral features5They also reported single
particle velocity dispersions of order the sound speed, which
is similar to what we ﬁnd for the relative velocity of weakly
coupled particles and therefore consistent with their motions
being largely uncorrelated. They also noted that the motion

5 Trapping is most eﬀective when the radial drift velocity is large,
i.e. close to St = 1. For smaller St the drift rate is limited by the
terminal velocity of the dust, while for St > 1 the radial drift
velocity is set by the torque from the drag forces, which is weaker
for larger St.

did not go as far as calculating the collision velocity between
particles, which we ﬁnd to be considerably smaller than the
sound speed.

9.1 2D vs. 3D

The main uncertainties related to our work are due to the
use of 2D simulations. For large St , where the collision velo-
cities are driven by gravitational forcing, the biggest eﬀect
will be due to the vertical component of the motion. Since
the size of the spiral structures is of order a scale height
in both the vertical and radial directions, the diﬀerence is
unlikely to be more than a factor of two. The second un-
certainty is due to the importance of small scale structure.
However, since our simulations show a similar cut oﬀ in the
azimuthal power spectrum of the density ﬂuctuations to the
3D simulations of Boley et al. (2007) we are conﬁdent that
small scale structure will not be important when the driving
is dominated by gravitational forcing.

Conversely, since we ﬁnd that coupling to small scale
ﬂuctuations in the velocity ﬁeld is important for driving
particles with St < 3, the small scale structure will be im-
portant for small particles. Using high resolution 2D simu-
lations, Gibbons et al. (2015) found that self-gravity drives
short-lived eddies with a minimum scale of ∼ 0.1H, which
corresponds to λstop for St = 1. Therefore, we expect that
in 2D even driving by gas drag is unlikely to drive strong
collisions for St < 0.3 (i.e. in the regime where we are un-
able to measure the dust velocity dispersion accurately in
our simulations). However, it is currently unknown whether
these results will extend to 3D or whether the formation and
destruction of eddies can drive fully-developed turbulence. If
this is the case, we would expect that at small St collisions
between equal sized dust particles in self-gravitating discs
would be analogous to the turbulent case, in which the colli-
sion velocity also has an St 1/2 dependence (Ormel & Cuzzi
2007). However, in either case we expect that the relative

drift between particles of diﬀerent sizes will be the domin-
ant cause of collisions for St < 1

Note that we do not predict strong settling of grains in
self-gravitating discs even though we predict that the local
velocity dispersion of small grains is very low. As found by
the 3D simulations of Rice et al. (2004), it turns out that
the thickness of the dust layer is comparable to the gas
layer, independent of particle size. The reason for this is
that large particles have ∆vmed ∼ cs, giving a particle layer
thickness Hp = ∆vmedΩ−1 ∼ H. For small grains the scale-
height is controlled by the balance of sedimentation and dif-
fusion (Dubrulle et al. 1995; Youdin & Lithwick 2007) and

the scale-height is given by Hp/H ∼ pαz/St /p1 + αz/St ,
where αz is the turbulent parameter for diﬀusion. While for
small grains ∆vmed ≪ cs on scales of λstop, the large scale
turbulent velocity of the gas is of order cs (Shi & Chiang
2014), suggesting αz ∼ 1 and Hp ∼ H for St ≪ 1. There-
fore, we expect Hp ∼ H to hold more or less independently of
particle size. With such large scale-heights, the self-gravity
in the dust layer is likely to be unimportant unless growth
to St ∼ 0.3 occurs.

9.2 Grain growth to St > 0.3

We now consider whether it is possible, starting with ar-
bitrarily small grains, for these to grow to the point where
direct gravitational collapse into planetesimals is possible.
Such an outcome requires that the dust to gas ratio is sig-
niﬁcantly enhanced locally due to trapping of dust in spiral
features. Eﬃcient dust trapping requires two conditions to
be met a) grains grow to a Stokes number of ∼ 0.3 or above
(this paper and Gibbons et al. 2012) and b) the spiral fea-
tures are suﬃciently pronounced that convergent radial ﬂows
within spiral features exceeds the dust’s mean radial inﬂow6.

6 The spiral features must create pressure maxima. If the ﬂuctu-
ations are small enough then they can result in pressure changes
relative to the background gradient without creating maxima

Clarke (2009). The black dashed line shows the boundary between the Epstein and Stokes drag regimes. Right: Corresponding collision
velocity in a self-gravitating disc. Colour coding is as in the left panel. The solid lines show collision velocities calculated as being the
maximum of the diﬀerential radial drift velocity (assuming particles diﬀer by a factor of two in size) and the mono-disperse local relative
velocity dispersion. In cases where the latter dominates, the former is shown by the dashed lines. The transition to fully quadratic Stokes
drag occurs for size above 100 m. The velocities shown in the right hand panel are obtained from radial scalings of the simulation results
(which equate to conditions at 60 AU in this disc model), being derived from Figure 7 for 100 > /St > 1, Figure 16 for St = 1 and
an extrapolation based on the short friction limit for smaller Stokes numbers. For St > 1, the scaling of relative velocity with cooling
timescale (β) is taken from the results of Figure 13.

In practice this implies that β (the local ratio of disc cool-
ing time to dynamical time) is suﬃciently small (< 150; see
section 8 and Gibbons et al. 2012). The latter condition re-
stricts the region of the disc in which this process can work
(favouring larger radii); the former places a requirement that
grains can grow to St = 0.3 without experiencing collision
velocities in excess of their fragmentation thresholds.

In our following discussion we make several assump-
tions: i) For small grains the relative collision velocity is
dominated by the diﬀerential radial drift velocity acquired
once the grain population achieves a modest (factor two)
spread in sizes. For small grains we expect that the scaling
can be derived using the short friction time limit ∆vdrift ∼
(ts,1 − ts,2)∇P/ρ. Since ∇P/ρ ∼ (∆Σ/ΣH)c2
s we expect
∆vdrift ∼ (∆Σ/Σ)(c2
s/H)(ts,1 − ts,2), where ∆Σ/Σ is the
amplitude of surface density ﬂuctuations. ii) Drag is in the
Epstein limit so that for grain size a, ts ∝ a/ρcs. iii) In
the absence of observationally calibrated models for self-
gravitating discs we use the pseudo-viscous models of self-
regulated self-gravitating discs from Clarke (2009). In par-
ticular, the simulations run here (for which β = 10 and
H/R ∼ 0.05) correspond to a radius of 60 au and accre-
tion rate (driven by gravitational torques in the disc) of
∼ 10−7 M⊙ yr−1, with a sound speed of ∼ 200 m s−1. The
disc in this region is optically thick with opacity dominated
by ice grains. The relevant radial scalings for such a disc are:
cs ∝ R−1.5, ρ ∝ R−3 and ∆Σ/Σ ∝ β−0.5 ∝ R9/4. This re-
gime extends inwards to the point where ice grains sublime
(around 15 au for this accretion rate). A radius of 30 au cor-
responds to β = 150 which we estimate as being the inner
limit for which trapping in spirals is eﬀective, given grains
of a suitable Stokes number. Figure 17 illustrates the ra-
dial dependence of Stokes number and collision velocity as

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2015)

a function of particle size given our model disc (see Figure
caption for details).

Answering the question posed above then boils down
to determining whether collision velocities are small enough
to permit growth to St= 0.3 at radii > 30 au (noting that
at such radii the grains are expected to be icy)7. If we fold
together the radial scalings given above and the expression
for the diﬀerential radial drift of dust in multi-size dust pop-
ulations, we ﬁnd that the diﬀerential drift velocity between
two particles with ﬁxed sizes scales as:
∆vdrift ∝ R15/4,
with radius since it is associated with a ﬁxed Stokes number
and, for our assumed disc structure, St ∝ R3. For typical
parameters associated with self-gravitating discs, we ﬁnd a
maximum grain size

7 This argument neglects the possibility of lucky growth, in which
a small fraction of dust particles avoid high velocity collisions
and grow beyond this size (Windmark et al. 2012; Garaud et al.
2013). However, unless runaway growth can occur this is unlikely
to aﬀect the bulk of the mass distribution. Also, current estim-
ates of the eﬀectiveness of lucky growth are model dependedent
and likely sensitive to the collision velocity distribution used
(Dr¸ażkowska et al. 2014; Pan & Padoan 2014).

16

Booth & Clarke

Since the fragmentation threshold for ices may be
as high as vfrag > 15 m s−1 (Gundlach & Blum 2015;
Wada et al. 2009), the growth of icy grains into the St = 0.3
to St = 3 range may be possible. Collisional growth much
beyond these sizes is clearly impossible due to the high col-
lision velocities, a fact that may actually help a signiﬁcant
fraction of the mass in icy dust to be concentrated in these
critical sizes. However, detailed modelling is needed to de-
termine whether growth to the critical sizes can occur since
even a moderate fraction of collisions leading to fragment-
ation may prevent growth to the critical, metre scale, sizes
as the net growth times may be long. Even so, gravitational
fragmentation of icy grains may be a viable way to produce
planetesimals at radii > 30 au early in the disc’s evolution.
If suﬃcient growth to St = 1 does occur so that dust
driven fragmentation takes place, then the typical mass of
bound clumps should be the Jeans mass in the dust layer:

MJ =

v

.

(14)

noting that σv is the local velocity dispersion which, at low
St, may be much less than the diﬀerential radial drift velo-
city (Equation 11). At 60 au, where β = 10 and σv ∼ 0.1cs
for St = 1, we ﬁnd MJ ≈ 5 × 10−2(ρd/ρg)−1/2M⊕. For
comparison, using shearing-sheet simulations Gibbons et al.
(2014) found clump masses of order 3× 10−3M⊕ (for β = 10
and similar disc properties). While the simulations produce
fragments that are ∼ a factor ten lower in mass than our es-
timates, this is to be expected since the simulations include
the self-gravity of the dust.

(15)

Adopting the β dependence of σv from subsection 7.2
and the radial scaling of β expected in the regime of ice
dominated cooling we obtain:
σv ∼ β−0.5vk St 1/2 ∝ St 1/2R7/4.
At St = 1 this results in λstop < H for R < 60 au and
thus driving by self-gravity density ﬂuctuations will be inef-
ﬁcient, making Equation 15 an over-estimate of the velocity
dispersion. Instead we expect that the dominant driving of
velocity dispersion at smaller radii and St ∼ 1 may be the
turbulent gas velocity, which is also weaker at longer cool-
ing times (Shi & Chiang 2014). Therefore, we expect that
the typical masses should be less than those estimated from
Equation 15 (≈ 4.5 × 10−5(ρd/ρg)−1/2M⊕ at 30 au), with
10 or 100 km planetesimals perhaps more typical outcomes
than Moon-mass or Ceres-mass objects.

Finally we note that even though we have shown that
growth to St > 0.3 (and hence signiﬁcant particle concen-
tration) requires icy grains, even silicate grains with vfrag ≈
1 m s−1 can grow to St ∼ 10−2 or cm-sizes (Equation 12).
We thus expect spectral evidence of grain growth in self-
gravitating discs even in the absence of icy grains.

While cm-sized grains correspond to Stokes numbers
of ∼ 10−2 during the self-gravitating phase they will have
St & 1 in typical Class II discs, once the accretion rate onto
star has decreased and the correponding surface density has
dropped. Although this increase in Stokes number means
that perturbations driven by the disc are not as strongly
damped, we have to also consider how the perturbations and
corresponding collision velocity change as the disc evolves.
To do this we once again make use of the pseudo-viscous
models for self-gravitating discs and consider how the col-

˙M , decreases

lision velocity changes as the accretion rate,
towards the end of the self-gravitating phase.

Clarke (2009) showed that, while both Σ ∝ ˙M 1/3 and
cs ∝ ˙M 1/3, the cooling time β does not depend on ˙M (in
the range of interest, 30–60 au). Thus, in the Epstein regime,
St ∝ ˙M −1/3. Incorporating these behaviours into our scaling
relations results in σv ∝ ˙M −1/6 (since σv ∝ St 1/2); ∆vdrift
˙M since although St increases
is however independent of
with decreasing ˙M , this is counteracted by the decrease in
cs. These relations show that the cm-size silicate grains will
survive the self-gravitating phase and thus may already be
present at the start of the Class II phase. Thus the detection
of large grains (cm-size) in very young systems such as HL
Tau and WL 12 may be evidence of eﬀective grain growth
during, or before, the self-gravitating phase.

9.3 Weakly coupled particles: St > 3

We have seen above that we do not expect solids to grow
into the weakly coupled ‘planetesimal’ regime with St > 3
by coagulation alone, owing to the rise in velocity disper-
sion with Stokes number. Nevertheless, we have argued that
it may be possible to grow in this way to Stokes numbers
(0.3 − 3) where grains are suﬃciently concentrated so as to
lead to gravitational collapse. In this way it is possible that
self-gravitating discs may from a population of planetesimals
as originally suggested by Rice et al. (2004). We now con-
sider the implications of our calculations for the subsequent
evolution of such a planetesimal population.

For

large grains and planetesimals with St ≫
in good agreement with
1 we found ∆vmed ≈ 2cs,
Walmswell et al. (2013). For similar sized planetesimals, col-
lisions at these velocities will be above the catastrophic dis-
ruption threshold, Q∗
RD, except for the largest planetesim-
als for which their gravitational binding energy exceeds the
collision kinetic energy (s & 100 km, Stewart & Leinhardt
2009). However, collisions will be rare since the time between
collisions, tc ∼ 104( s
m ) yr, exceeds the lifetime of the self-
gravitating phase (a few 105 yr) for sizes above a few 10s of
meters (the above estimate makes the optimistic assumption
that the entire solid component of the disc is in the form of
objects of size s).

We can also use Figure 17 to examine typical velocity
dispersions in the planetesimal regime. This plot takes into
account the fact that the form of the drag term transitions
from the Epstein regime to the ‘Stokes drag’ regime in which
the drag varies quadratically with relative velocity and hence
the Stokes number is a function of relative velocity as well
as particle size and disc parameters. This transition occurs
for particles with size s > 9λmfp/4, where λmfp is the mean
free path, the drag forces transitions to the Stokes regime,
in which St is a function of velocity as well as size (Whipple
1972; Weidenschilling 1977). Since λmfp ≈ 50(R/60 au)3 m,
particles with St < 1 are in the Epstein regime, but for
particles with St > 1 we have to consider the transition to
Stokes drag, which happens at

m,

60 au(cid:19)3

s ≈ 110(cid:18) R
which corresponds to St ≈ 120(R/60 au)6. The transition
to the fully quadratic Stokes drag regime occurs at s ≈
500(R/60 au)2 m.

(16)

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2015)

Figure 17 shows that planestesimal scale objects are
generally in the Stokes drag regime and that the velocity
dispersion falls steeply at small radii, a result that is read-
ily explicable in terms of the normalised cooling timescale
(β) dependence shown in Figure 13 and the fact that the
cooling time is long at small radii. This suggests that the
eccentricity of planetesimals will be predominantly driven
at apocentre as argued by Walmswell et al. (2013). Thus we
expect that if a population of planetesimals is formed by
this mechanism at radii > 30 au (as argued in 9.2) then
they will be perturbed into eccentric orbits which visit the
inner disc but which retain apocentres > 30 au. Using the
numerical results of Walmswell et al. (2013), we ﬁnd that
few planetesimals are likely to end up, at the end of the
disc’s self-gravitating phase, at radii well within 30 au: this
is because this represents a large radial excursion for any
planetesimals formed in the outer part of the disc (where
spiral structure is strongest) while for those planetesimals
formed at the limiting radius of 30 au the relatively weak
spiral structure results in weak orbital excitation.

Even though we expect the radial re-conﬁguration of
the planetesimal distribution to be minor, re-scaling the
results of Walmswell et al suggests that the planetesimals
would nevertheless end up on rather eccentric orbits (typic-
ally in the range e ∼ 0.1 − 0.5) over the lifetime of the self-
gravitating disc. This value should be contrasted with the
typical eccentricities of planetesimals established through
equilibrium between gas drag and stirring by larger bodies in
non-self gravitating discs (∼ 0.01; Kokubo et al. 2000). The
high eccentricities of any planetesimals formed in the self-
gravitating phase means that they would not be signiﬁcantly
damped by gas drag over the entire age of the gas disc, since
the estimated eccentricity damping timescale given these ini-
tial eccentricities is > 108 years (Ida et al. 2008). Similarly,
the high velocity dispersion means that gravitational focus-
sing is ineﬀective in enhancing the rate of mutual collisions,
so that typical collision times are in excess of 107 years.
Therefore, we can expect the population of eccentric plan-
etesimals to be long lived unless disturbed by some other
process, such as planetary migration.

10 CONCLUSION

Our simulations show that the spiral structure in self-
gravitating protoplanetary discs is only eﬀective at driv-
ing a large velocity dispersion in the dust for particles with
Stokes number St (ratio of stopping time to dynamical time)
St & 3. Below St ∼ 1 the velocity dispersion is driven
by coupling to small scale structure in the gas velocity via
drag forces, resulting in collision velocities that are consid-
erably less than the sound speed. Instead, the diﬀering drag
forces felt by particles of diﬀerent sizes gives rise to diﬀer-
ent terminal velocities larger than the velocity dispersion for
particles of a single size.

The relative velocities produced by diﬀerential radial
drift in multi-sized grain populations are also an important
consideration for particle growth in non-self gravitating discs
(Dullemond & Dominik 2005; Brauer et al. 2008) and in the
inner regions of self-gravitating discs where the spiral struc-
ture is weak. Here, however, we concentrate on the regime
where spiral structure is strong enough to produce signiﬁc-

ant grain trapping in density maxima and where high local
values of the solid to gas ratio can trigger collective phe-
nomena (ultimately gravitational collapse) of the solid com-
ponent. The regime of strong spiral structure, where there is
the potential for trapping and concentration of solids, cor-
responds to radii in the disc beyond ∼ 30 au.
Eﬃcient trapping however requires, in addition to re-
gions of strong spiral structure, that particles can grow so as
to enter a critical regime of Stokes numbers: 0.3 < St < 3.
Thus growth to these sizes (St ∼ 1 corresponds to metre
sizes at 60 au; see left panel of Figure 17). We ﬁnd that the
median relative velocity of metre sized objects at 60 au is
around 10 m s−1 (see right hand panel of Figure 17). This
clearly rules out suﬃcient growth in the case of silicate
dominated grains (for which the fragmentation threshold
is around 1 m s−1) whose growth would be limited to cm-
sizes. However we note that growth to cm scales is suﬃcient
to produce observational signatures of grain growth in self-
gravitating discs.

The best prospects for direct gravitational collapse
comes from icy grains since the fragmentation threshold of
ices is above 15 m s−1. We noted above that eﬃcient dust
trapping is restricted to regions outside 30 A.U., where
the spiral structure is suﬃciently strong. Provided that
˙M < 10−6 M⊙ yr−1 the water snow line corresponds to
< 30 au. We thus argue that icy solids may be able to grow
to the point where they can be concentrated and ultimately
undergo gravitational collapse in this region of the disc.

If gravitational collapse indeed occurs, then the size
scale of fragments (‘planetesimals’) is largely controlled by
the driving of the dust velocity by turbulent gas ﬂuctuations.
Although the resulting planetesimals will have their eccent-
ricities pumped by interaction with spiral structure in the
disc, they will remain largely conﬁned to the outer disc.
Their high eccentricities imply very long collision times and
very long timescales for drag from the disc gas, so that they
are unlikely to be further modiﬁed during the lifetime of the
gas disc. Therefore we suggest that the legacy of particle
growth during the earliest, self-gravitating, phase of the
disc’s evolution is likely to be a population of icy planetes-
imals on eccentric orbits in the outer disc.

APPENDIX A: GRAVITATIONAL SOFTENING
IN 2D

Since each particle in a two dimensional disc simulation represents
a column of gas with a scale height H, it is necessary to soften the
gravitational force, which no longer has r−2 dependence for r <
H. Often a Plummer potential is used for this purpose, φ = (r2 +
ǫ2)−1/2, where ǫ ≈ 0.6H is often used. As shown by Müller et al.
(2012), this underestimates the force for r < H since it produces
a force with ∝ r rather than f ∝ r−1. For an isothermal column
with ρ = ρ0 exp(−z2/(2H 2)), integrating over the vertical density
gives the following acceleration at the mid-plane a distance r from
the particle, which gives the gravitational acceleration, g,

where K0 and K1 are modiﬁed Bessel functions of the second

I(x) →p2/πx as x → 0. Using a polynomial of the form

to be reasonably accurate. The factor χ ≡ χ(ǫ, H) takes into ac-

imation for χ(ǫ, H), we solve for the force at the disc mid-plane by,
taking the Fourier transform of the Poisson equation, and solving
when z = 0, giving

Figure A1. Speciﬁc gravitational force, a/GΣ = ISPH/r2 at z =
0, from a particle with the density given by Equation A5 (solid
lines), and the approximate form (Equation A6 and Equation A9,
dotted lines) for a range of diﬀerent softening parameters. The
approximation gives excellent agreement with the exact force in
the limits r ≫ βH and r ≪ βH, but under estimates the force
by 25 per cent at r = βH.

where f = pπ/2, reproduces these limits. For the ﬁtting con-
stants, we use A = 3/2, and set B to interpolate through the exact
value of I at r = H, I(1). This gives B = (1 + A)/I(1)− (1 + Af ).
For this choice of parameters the maximum relative error is less
than 1 per cent.

We note that the vertical structure in self-gravitating discs
diﬀers from a Gaussian. Müller et al. (2012) found a only 10 per
cent diﬀerence between the force calculated assuming a Gaussian
and isothermal density slab density proﬁles. The actual force error
introduced by using a vertically averaged must be smaller than
this, since for a disc with a Toomre Q parameter of Q = 1 both the
central star and disc self-gravity have equal importance (Lodato
2007).

Since the vertically integrated force diverges as r−1 for small
separations it is necessary to further soften the force between
neighbouring particles. Usually this is done by assuming that the
mass of each particle is distributed according to the SPH kernel,
ρi(r) = miW (r, hi), which leads to a self-consistent deﬁnition of
the SPH density estimate and a softening for the potential that
can be constructed using the Poisson equation (Dehnen 2001;
Price & Monaghan 2007). By a similar analogy a particle density
for disc simulations can be written as

ρ2D,i(R, z) = miWg(R, ǫi)

exp(cid:18)− z2

(A4)

Integrating ρ2D,i over z gives the usual deﬁnition for the (surface)
density in two dimensions when ǫi = hi. The idea now is to solve
the Poisson equation for this density distribution and use it to
construct a softening function ISPH. For simplicity, we use a 2D
Gaussian kernel rather than a Wendland or cubic spline kernel
for computing the softening, i.e.

For r ≪ ǫ, H; the density is approximately constant so we can

and ISPH = p2/πx3/3 for x ≪ H. In this way, we can expect a
