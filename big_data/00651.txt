Perturbative Expansion for the Maximum of Fractional Brownian Motion

Mathieu Delorme and Kay J¨org Wiese

Brownian motion is the only random process which is Gaussian, stationary and Markovian. Dropping the
Markovian property, i.e. allowing for memory, one obtains a class of processes called Fractional Brownian
motion, indexed by the Hurst exponent H. For H = 1/2, Brownian motion is recovered. We develop a
perturbative approach to treat the non-locality in time in an expansion in ε = H − 1/2. This allows us to
derive analytic results beyond scaling exponents for various observables related to extreme value statistics:
The maximum m of the process and the time tmax at which this maximum is reached, as well as their joint
distribution. We test our analytical predictions with extensive numerical simulations for different values of H.
They show excellent agreement, even for H far from 1/2.

INTRODUCTION

Random processes are ubiquitous in nature. Though many
processes can successfully be mExtensive numerical simula-
tions for different values of H test these analytical predic-
tions and show excellent agreement, even for large ε.odeled
by Markov chains and are well analyzed by tools of statis-
tical mechanics, there are also interesting and realistic sys-
tems which do not evolve with independent increments, and
thus are non-Markovian, i.e. history dependent. Dropping the
Markov property, but demanding that a continuous process be
scale-invariant and Gaussian with stationary increments de-
ﬁnes an enlarged class of random processes, known as frac-
tional Brownian motion (fBm). Such processes appear in a
broad range of contexts: Anomalous diffusion [1], diffusion of
a marked monomer inside a polymer [2, 3], polymer translo-
cation through a pore [3–6], single-ﬁle diffusion in ion chan-
nels [7, 8], the dynamics of a tagged monomer [9, 10], ﬁ-
nance (fractional Black-Scholes, fractional stochastic volatil-
ity models, and their limitations) [11–13], hydrology [14, 15],
and many more.

While averaged quantities have been studied extensively
and are well characterized, it is often more important to un-
derstand the extremal behavior of these processes, or the time
the process satisﬁes a given criterion [16]. These quantities
are associated with failure in fracture or earthquakes, a crash
in the stock market, the breakage of dams, the time one has to
heat, etc. For Brownian motion the three arcsine laws are well
studied examples. They state that for a Brownian process Xt,
with 0 < t < 1, and X0 = 0, three observables Y have the
same probability distribution, namely

P(Y < y) =
⇔ P(y) =

The observables in question are (see Fig. 1)

1. First (L´evy’s) arcsine law: The time the process Xt is

positive, (red in Fig. 1),

FIG. 1. The three arcsine laws discussed in the main text. tmax, in
green, is the time where the process achieves its maximum. tlast,
in blue, is the last time the process is at its starting value X0 = 0.
Finally, t+, in red, is the time spend in the positive half space, which
is the sum of the red intervals .

2. Second arcsine law: The last time the process is at its

initial position, (blue in Fig. 1),

tlast := sup{t ∈ [0, 1], Xt = 0} .

(4)

3. Third arcsine law: The time at which the process Xt
achieves its maximum (which is almost surely unique),
(green in Fig. 1)

tmax := t, s.t. Xt = sup{Xs, s ∈ [0, 1]} .

(5)

While these laws are well-studied for Brownian motion, lit-
tle is known about their generalization to other random pro-
cesses. In this article, we will generalize the third arcsine law
to fractional Brownian motion, and obtain the distribution of
the achieved maximum.

Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is a random process Xt
characterized by the Hurst exponent H which quantiﬁes the
growth of the 2-point function in time,

(cid:10)(Xt − Xs)2(cid:11) = 2|t − s|2H .

Up to now, analytical tools to study its extreme value statis-
tics were available only for Brownian motion, i.e. H = 1/2.
In this article, we aim to extend this to H (cid:54)= 1/2. This is

achieved by constructing a path integral, and evaluating it per-
turbatively around a Brownian, setting H = 1/2 + ε. This
technique has been introduced in Ref. [17]. We will calculate
the probability distribution of the maximum m of the process
and the time tmax at which the maximum is reached, as well
as their joint distribution. A short account of this work was
published in Ref. [18].

The article is structured as follows: Section II deﬁnes the
fBm, discusses its relation to anomalous diffusion, and deﬁnes
the observables related to extremal value statistics we wish to
study.
Section III introduces the path integral we need to calculate,
followed by its perturbative expansion in ε = H − 1/2. This
deﬁnes the main integrals to be calculated, for which we also
give a diagrammatic representation. As the calculations are
rather tedious, they are relegated to appendix C.

Section IV presents our results: We start by recalling scal-
ing relations in section IV A, before introducing our most gen-
eral formula, the probability to start at m1 > 0, to reach the
minimum x0 ≈ 0 at time time t, and to ﬁnish at time T > t
in m2. This allows us to derive several simpler results: First
the distribution of times when the maximum is achieved, for
a Brownian known as the third arcsine law (section IV C).
Second, the distribution of the value of this maximum. And
third, the joint distribution of maximum, and the time when
this maximum is taken.

Extensive numerical simulations for different values of H

test these analytical predictions in section V.

Conclusions are given in Section VI, followed by several
appendices: Appendix A gives details on the perturbation ex-
pansion. Appendix B reviews results from [17], including a
new derivation of the latter. Appendix C calculates the main
new, and most difﬁcult, contribution. Appendix D gives de-
tails on the corrections to the third Arcsine Law, while for the
attained maximum and its cumulative distribution this is done
in appendices E and F. Appendix G gives a list of used inverse
Laplace transforms. Finally, in appendix H is veriﬁed that the
second cumulant is correctly reproduced.

II. FRACTIONAL BROWNIAN MOTION AND

OBSERVABLES

A. Deﬁnition of the fBm

FBm is a generalization of standard Brownian motion to
other fractal dimensions, introduced in its ﬁnal form by Man-
delbrot and Van Ness [19]. It is a Gaussian process (Xt)t∈R,
starting at zero, X0 = 0, with mean (cid:104)Xt(cid:105) = 0 and covariance
function (variance)

(cid:104)XtXs(cid:105) = s2H + t2H − |t − s|2H .

(7)

A fBm Yt starting at a non-zero value y = Y0 is deﬁned as
Yt = Xt + y, with Xt as above. The parameter H ∈ (0, 1)
appearing in (7) is the Hurst exponent. Standard Brownian
motion corresponds to H = 1/2; there the covariance func-
tion (7) reduces to (cid:104)XtXs(cid:105) = 2 min(s, t). Unless H = 1/2,

2

the process is non-Markovian , i.e. its increments are not in-
dependent: For H > 1/2 they are correlated, whereas for
H < 1/2 they are anti-correlated:

(cid:104)∂tXt ∂sXs(cid:105) =2H(2H − 1)|t − s|2(H−1).

(8)

It is important to note that the process is stationary, as the
second moment (and thus the whole distribution) of the incre-
ments is a function of the time difference |t − s| only,

(cid:104)(Xt − Xs)2(cid:105) = 2|t − s|2H .

(9)

The fact that a fBm process is non-Markovian makes its study
difﬁcult, as most of the standard stochastic-process tools (de-
composing transition probabilities into products of propaga-
tors, or writing the evolution of a density using a Fokker-Plank
equation) rely on the Markov property.

B. Anomalous diffusion

Anomalous diffusion is another interesting property of the
fBm. It is caracterized by the non-linear growth (for H (cid:54)= 0.5)
of the second moment of the process,
t (cid:105) = 2t2H .

(cid:104)X 2

(10)

For H < 1/2, a fBm is a sub-diffusive process, while for
H > 1/2, it is super-diffusive.

Anomalous diffusion is usually implied by a stronger prop-
erty (but equivalent in the case of a Gaussian process): self-
similarity of exponent H.
It means that rescaling time by
λ > 0 and space by λ−H leaves every averaged observable
(cid:104)O[Xt](cid:105) deﬁned on the process invariant,

(cid:104)O[λ−H Xλt](cid:105) = (cid:104)O[Xt](cid:105) .

(11)

This property is stronger in the sense that the growth of every
moment, and not only the second one, is governed by the same
exponent H: (cid:104)X n

t (cid:105) ∼ tnH.

It is well known that standard Brownian motion is the only
continuous process with stationary, independent (Markovian)
and Gaussian increments. As a consequence, every process
2-self-similar, i.e. exhibits normal diffusion.
in this class is 1
To obtain an anomalous diffusive process, one of these three
hypotheses has to be removed. This gives three main classes
of anomalous diffusion:

• heavy tails of the increments (Levy-ﬂight process) or
heavy tails in the waiting time between increments
(CTRW processes); these processes are non-Gaussian.
• time dependence of the diffusive constant: the distribu-
tion of the increments is time dependent, i.e. the process
is non-stationary.

• correlations between increments:

Markovian

the process is non-

bel or Fr´echet distribution [16, 24]. This is the equivalent of
the central-limit theorem, which classiﬁes the sums, or equiv-
alently averages, of a large number of independent identically
distributed (i.i.d.) variables.

The case of strongly correlated variables was a natural ex-
tension to this problem, as many physically relevant situations
present signiﬁcant deviations from the i.i.d. case. Many re-
sults were derived for random walks and Brownian motion
[25, 26]. The distribution of the largest eigenvalue is also a
central question in random matrix theory [27]. Finally, some
previous study in the context of non-Markovian processes can
be found in Ref. [28–30].

In this article we study the extremal properties of a frac-
tionnal Brownian motion Xt. The main observables are the
maximum m = maxt∈[0,T ] Xt and the time tmax when this
maximum is reached. Figure 2 shows an illustration for dif-
ferent values of H, using the same random numbers for the
Fourier modes. We will denote P T
H (t) their re-
spective probability distributions. Previous studies on these
distributions, focusing on the small-scale behaviour, can be
found in Refs. [31, 32].

H (m) and P T

These observables are closely linked to other quantities of
interest, such as the ﬁrst-return time, the survival probability,
the persistence exponent, and the statistics of records.

III. THE PERTURBATIVE APPROACH

A. Path integral formulation and the Action

Following the ideas of [17, 33, 34], we start with the path-

integral,

Z +(m1, t1; x0; m2, t2) =

(cid:90) Xt1+t2 =m2

D[X] Θ[X] δ(Xt1 − x0) e−S[X] .

(12)

(cid:81)t1+t2

It sums over all paths Xt, weighted by their probability
e−S[X], starting at X0 = m1 > 0, passing through x0
(close to 0) at time t1, and ending in Xt1+t2 = m2 > 0,
while staying positive for all t ∈ [0, T = t1 + t2]. The latter
is enforced by the product of Heaviside functions Θ[X] :=
s=0 Θ(Xs). This path integral depends on the Hurst ex-
ponent H through the action. Since Xt is a Gaussian process,
the action S can (at least formally) be constructed from the
covariance function of Xt,

(cid:90)

S[X] =

1
2

t1,t2

Xt1 G(t1, t2)Xt2 .

(13)

Here (cid:104)Xt1Xt2(cid:105) = G−1(t1, t2). This, however, is not enough
to evaluate the path integral (12), since it is not evident how
to implement the product of Θ-functions. Following the for-
malism of Ref. [17], we use standard Brownian motion as a
starting point for a perturbative expansion, setting H = 1
2 + ε
with ε a small parameter; then the action at ﬁrst order in ε is

FIG. 2. Two realisations of fBm paths for different values of H,
generated using the same random numbers for the Fourier modes in
the Davis and Harte procedure [23]. The observables m and tmax are
given.

FBm is the only process which is Gaussian, stationary, and
statistically self-similar. As the ﬁrst two hypotheses are natu-
ral in a large class of processes appearing in nature, and self-
similarity with exponent H (cid:54)= 1/2 is equivalent to anomalous
diffusion for a Gaussian process, fBm appears as an important
representative for anomalous diffusion.

Interestingly, several processes commonly used in physics,
mathematics, and computer science belong to the fBm class.
For expample, it was recently proven that the dynamics of a
tagged particle in single-ﬁle diffussion (cf. [8, 20–22]) has at
large times the fBm covariance function (7) with Hurst expo-
nent H = 1/4.

The objective of this article is to study fBm in the con-
text of what is now called extreme-value statistics. While the
knowledge of averages or of the typical behavior is an impor-
tant step in understanding and comparing stochastic models
to experiments or data, there are situations were the interest
lies in the extremes or rare events. For example, the physics
of disordered systems at low temperatures is governed by the
states with a (close to) minimal energy in the random energy
landscape. Extreme weather conditions are of importance in
the dimensioning of infrastructures such as dams and bridges.
More generally, extreme value questions appear naturally in
many optimization problem.

The simplest and ﬁrst case studied for these extreme-value
statistics was the distribution of the maximum of a large num-
ber N of independent and identically distributed random vari-
ables, which is now well understood in the large-N limit
thanks to the classiﬁcation of the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko
theorem: Depending on the initial distribution of the vari-
ables, the rescaled maximum follows either a Weibull, Gum-

The time τ is a regularization cutoff for coinciding times (a
UV cutoff). We will see that it has no impact on the distri-
bution of observables which can be extracted from the path
integral. (One can also introduce discrete times spaced by τ
[17]).

The ﬁrst line of Eq. (14), which we denote S0[X], is the ac-
tion for standard Brownian motion, with a rescaled diffusion
constant

Dε,τ = 1 + 2ε[1 + ln(τ )] + O(ε2) (cid:39) (eτ )2ε.

(15)

As we will

It is a dimensionfull constant, as fBm and standard Brownian
motion do not have the same time dimension. The second line,
which we denote S1[X], is the ﬁrst correction to the action. It
is non-local in time, which implies that the process is non-
Markovian (even if we neglect O(ε2) terms). We check this
expansion of the action in appendix H, where we compute the
covariance of the process from a path integral, and recover
Eq. (7) at ﬁrst order in ε.
this path integral
Z +(m1, t1; x0; m2, t2), in the limit of x0 → 0, encodes a
plethora of information about the maximum of the process:
both distributions P T
H (t) can be extracted from it,
as well as the joint distribution. Further, the same distributions
in the case of a fBm bridge.
It is important to note that the limit of x0 → 0 is non-trivial,
as it forces the process to go close to an absorbing boundary
which leads to non-trivial scaling involving the persistence ex-
ponent θ deﬁned below in section IV A.

B. The order-0 term

Having expressed the perturbative expansion of the action,
the main task is to compute the path integral (12), at ﬁrst order
in ε, and in the limit of small x0. Expanding the exponential
of the action in (12),

e−S[X] = e−S0[X] (1 − S1[X] + ...) ,

(16)

allows us to compute the path integral perturbatively in the

As before, we denote T = t1+t2. To compute Z +

pose it into three terms, distinguished by their time ordering.
Denote Z +

t1 < τ1 < τ2, and Z +

In the ﬁrst term, the interaction affects only the process in the
time interval [0, t1], and there is no coupling with the process
on the time interval [t1, t1 + t2]. This leads, as shown in ap-

Here P +

This object, which we need in the limit of x0 → 0, was studied
and computed in Ref. [17]. The result is recalled in appendix
B, and recalculated using more efﬁcient technology developed
here. The second term is similar to the ﬁrst, swapping the two
time intervals,

Z +
β (m1, t1; x0; m2, t2) = P +

(29)
The third term, Z +
γ , is more complicated as the interaction
couples the two time intervals [0, t1] and [t1, T = t1 + t2].
We can still take advantage of locality in time of the action S0
to write the path integral (26), with time integrals restricted to
0 < τ1 < t1 < τ2 < T , as a product of simpler path integrals:

In this expression, all path integrals can be expressed in terms of the bare propagator P +
0 ; we refer to appendix A for how to deal
with the terms containing ˙X. We have not written the cut-off τ as there are no short-time divergences that need to be regularized
β ). The structure of the time integrals, which are products of convolutions, suggests to use
(contrary to the terms Z +

D. Graphical representation

It is useful to give a diagrammatic representation for the
terms of the perturbative expansion. We denote bare propaga-
tors (33) with a solid blue lines. The interaction between two
points (τ1, x1) and (τ2, x2) is represented in red. As can be
seen from Eq. (32), it acts as 2∂x1 on the propagator starting at
x1, 2∂x2 on the propagator starting at x2; it also translates the
Laplace variable of each time slice between these two points
by +y. The space variables x1, x2 and the interaction vari-
able y (which has the inverse dimension of time) have to be
integrated from 0 to ∞. In case of divergences, the integration
has to be cut off with a large-y cutoff (c.f. appendix G for the
link between the short time cutoff τ and the large y cutoff).

The contribution of Z +

γ , is computed in detail in Appendix
C, and represented in Figure 3 (left), together with the contri-
bution Z +

α (right).

IV. ANALYTICAL RESULTS

We present here some known scaling results about extremal
properties of the fBm. We then show how our perturbative ex-
pansion, and the computation of Z +(m1, t1; x0; m2, t2), al-
lows us to obtain analytical results on the distributions beyond
these scaling arguments. Some of our results were already
presented in a Letter [18].

A. Scaling results

Let us start with the the survival probability S(T, x), and
the persistence exponent θ, deﬁned for any random process

For a review of these concepts in the context of theoretical
physics, we refer to [35]. In a large class of processes the ex-
ponent θ is independent of x, and characterizes the power-law
decay for the probability of long positive excursions. For frac-
tional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H it was shown
that θx = θ = 1 − H [32, 36]. To understand the link of
S(T, x) with the maximum distribution for fBm, we use self
afﬁnity of the process Xt to write P T

(35)

P T

H (m) =

Here f is a scaling function depending on H. The survival
probability is related to the maximum distribution by

S(T, x) =

P T (m) dm =

2T H

(36)

This states that due to translational invariance a realisation of
a fBm starting at x and remaining positive is the same as a
realisation starting at 0 and having a minimum larger than
−x. Finally, the symmetry x → −x (for a fBm starting at
X0 = 0) gives the correspondence between minima and max-
ima. These considerations allow us to predict the scaling be-
havior of P T
H (m) at small m from the large-T behaviour of
S(T, x) [32],

For the distribution of the time at which the maximum is
achieved we can estimate the behavior close to the origin by
assuming that small values of the maximum are reached close
to the origin. Starting with

The ﬁrst term Z +
0 of this expansion is given in Eq. (24), while
the second term Z +
1 was split into three contributions Z +
α ,
Z +
γ , see Eq. (27). The ﬁrst two terms can be ob-
β and Z +
tained explicitly from (B8), while the third one is computed
in appendix C, the result being split between (C13), (C29)
and (C45).
In order to display a compact form, we choose T ≡ t1 +
t2 = 1 (which is equivalent to rescaling m1 and m2 by T −H
and t1 and t2 by T −1) and introduce new rescaled (dimen-
sionless) variables,

C. The third Arcsine Law: Distribution of the time when the

maximum is reached

To simplify the result (44), we can extract from it the dis-
tribution of a single observable. We start with the probability
distribution PH (t) of tmax, the time when the fBm achieves its
maximum. For Brownian motion (H = 1/2), this distribution
is well known as the third arcsine law, because the cumulative
distribution involves the arcsin function c.f. Eq. (1),
, for t ∈ [0, T ] .

Until now, only scaling properties were known for this distri-
bution in the general case [37], as recalled in Eq. (40).
The path integral (12), in the limit of x0 → 0, selects paths
which go through x0 ≈ 0+ at time t1 while staying positive.
This means that we sum over paths reaching their minimum

(in the interval [0, t1 + t2], and which is almost surely unique)
at t1, starting at m1 and ending at m2. This is equivalent
to summing over paths starting at 0, reaching their minimum
with value −m1 at time t1, and ending in m2 − m1. Inte-
grating over m1 and m2 ﬁnally gives the sum over all paths
reaching their minimum in t1, independent of the value of this
minimum, and the end point. Up to a normalization, this is
the probability distribution of tmin. By symmetry, this is the
same as the distribution of tmax. Formally, it reads

P T

H (t) = lim

The normalization Z N depends on x0 and T . It ensures that
H (t) is normalized; it can be expressed in terms of Z + as

m2 allows us to recover Eq. (46) with normalisation ZN =
0.

For the order-ε correction, the integrations over m1 and m2
are lengthy. This is done in appendix D. It allows us to write

The plain lines represent the analytic prediction from our perturbative
theory (at ﬁrst order in ε) given in Eq. (55); the symbols are results
from numerical simulations, c.f. section V.

On the other hand, the scaling results presented in IV A pre-
H (m) behaves at small scale as m1/H−2,
dict that for any H, P T
as given in Eq. (38).

Using our path integral, we can go further. Similarly to the
distribution of tmax, the distribution of the maximum m itself
can be extracted from Z +, deﬁned in Eq. (12),

Eq. (45) , and logarithmic terms,

This is a direct consequence of an important theorem in the

Eq. (58). A proof of this theorem and a derivation of its im-

Comparison of our full prediction (i.e. not only the asymp-

the next section V.

E. Survival probability

The survival probability S(x, T ) is deﬁned as the probabil-
ity for a process Xt to stay positive up to time t, while starting
at X0 = x,

S(x, t) := prob (Xt > 0, ∀t ∈ [0, T ]| X0 = x) .

ability is the cumulative distribution of the maximum value,
and reads

S(y) =

F. The joint distribution for tmax and m

The result (44) was obtained by considering paths starting
at X0 = m1 > 0 with an absorbing boundary at x = 0 con-
straining the process to stay positive, as can be seen from the

10

where now y = m√
2tH (to keep y a dimensionless variable). It
is important to note that the variable y here is not the same as
in Eq. (55), as the maximum m is rescaled by t (the time at
which the maximum is reached), and not by T (the total time
of the process).
The non-trivial correction G(y|ϑ) is obtained from the re-

sult (44) as

While we can integrate Eq. (44) over y1 and y2 to obtain the
probability that the maximum is attained at time t, we were
√
in general not able to analytically integrate it solely over y2,
due to the presence of the term I(
ϑy2). An
exception are the two limiting cases ϑ = 0 and ϑ = 1, for
which

path-integral deﬁnition (12). Using translational invariance,
and the symmetry x ↔ −x of the fBm, we can reinterpret
this as the sum over paths starting at X0 = 0, reaching their
maximum (over the interval [0, T = t1 + t2]) of value m1 at
time t1, and ending in XT = m1 − m2 < m1.
The integral over m2 is then, in the limit x0 → 0 and up to
a normalisation factor Z N , the joint probability density for a
fBm to have a maximum value m = m1 at a time t = tmax =
t1 over the interval [0, T ]; this we can write as

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

To validate the perturbative approach used in this article, we
tested our analytical results with direct numerical simulations
of fBm paths. The discretized fBm paths are generated using
the Davis and Harte procedure as described in [23] (and ref-
erences therein). The idea is to take advantage of the station-
arity of the increments and use fast-Fourier transformations to
compute efﬁciently the square root of its covariance function.
This method is exact, i.e. the samples generated have exactly

The plain curves are the analytical prediction (70), where the scaling functions are given analytically for the two extremal cases, ϑ = 0 and
ϑ = 1 c.f. Eqs. (72)-(73); for 0 < ϑ < 1 the curves are obtained via numerical integration. The predicted spread of the curves (which collapse
2 to Eq. (66), plotted in black dots) is well reproduced in the numerics, both for ε > 0 and ε < 0. For ϑ → 1 the agreement with
for H = 1
numerics is remarkable, while for ϑ close to zero, we see signiﬁcant deviations. These deviations may be due to both discretisation effects and
ε2 corrections (they have the same sign for both ε > 0 and ε < 0).

Our estimation of F2 is plotted on ﬁgure 6 (right). Our pertur-

to write the integrals needed to compute F2 analytically; this,
however, is left for future work [40].

B. The distribution of the maximum

A. The third Arcsine Law

For the distribution of tmax, we want to test our analytical
results given in Eqs. (51)-(52). Fig. 4 shows the good agree-
ment between theory and numerics. To perform a more pre-
cise comparison, we extract from the numerically computed
num of the function F as

This function should converge, as ε → 0, to the theoretical
prediction (52). Obviously, statistical errors become relevant
in this limit due to the factor of ε−1, while for larger ε we ex-
pect to see deviation due to order-ε2 (and larger) corrections,
which are not taken into account in our analytical computa-
tions. As can be seen on Fig. 6, our numerical and analytical
results are in remarkable agreement for all values of H stud-
ied, both for ε positive and negative. This means in particular
that even for large values of ε (H = 0.8 or H = 0.2 in the
cases studied here), the order-ε correction is large as com-
pared to higher-order corrections.
The precision of our simulations allows us to numerically
investigate these subleading O(ε2) corrections, extracted as
follows,

for different values of ε (once rescaled by ε−1), suggests that

The left-hand side is evaluated from the normalized binned
distribution of the maximum for each fBm path, denoted
num(m). The right-hand side is the analytical result; the
P 1,H
constant term is evaluated by numerical integration such that
fH (y), given in Eq. (80), is normalized to 1.
The sample size N (i.e. lattice spacing dt = N−1) of the
discretized fBm used for this numerical test is important, as
the samples recover Brownian behavior for m smaller than a
cutoff of order N−H. This can be understood by assuming
that the typical value of the ﬁrst discretized point X1/N is of

(82)

Far small H the system size necessary to obtain the asymp-
totic behavior at small scale is very large, so we focus our tests
on H > 0.4. Figure 9 presents results for H = 0.4, H = 0.6
and H = 0.75, without any ﬁtting parameter. As predicted,
convergence to the small-scale behavior is quite slow. For ex-
ample, in the H = 0.6 plot the convergence to the small-scale
behavior is somewhere between 10−1 and 10−2 (in dimen-
sionless variables where we rescaled the total time to T = 1).
This might lead to a wrong numerical estimation of the per-
sistence exponent or other related quantities, if the crossover
to the large-scale behavior is not properly taken into account.
At large scales, the numerical data on Fig. 9 grow as m2ε,
consistent with the prediction (60).

As stated, for H < 0.5 the numerical simulations do not
allow us to investigate the small-scale behavior of the distri-
bution, as can be seen for H = 0.4 on ﬁgure 9. Nevertheless,
the agreement with the theoretical prediction is good in the
crossover region and in the beginning of the tail. The numer-
ical prefactor of the small-scale power law is also very sensi-
tive to numerical errors (and probably to ε2-corrections) due
to a vanishing probability when m → 0 for H < 0.5, as can
be seen in Fig. 5.

allows to derive the, to our knowledge, ﬁrst analytical results
for generic values of H in the range 0 < H < 1, beyond
scaling relations. The main, and most general result is the
joint probability of the value of the maximum and the time
when this maximum is reached, conditioned on the value of
the end point, as given in Eq. (44). From this, we extracted
simpler result, as the unconditioned distribution of the value
of the maximum, as well as distribution of the time when this
maximum is reached. These two distributions have non-trivial
features, which we compared to numerical simulations. The
remarkable agreement of the simulations with our predictions
is a valuable check of our method. It also shows that the per-
turbative approach gives surprisingly good results, even far
form the expansion point H = 1
2.

The method can be generalized to other cases of interest,
such as the other two Arcsine laws, linear and non-linear drift,
and fractional Brownian bridges. Work in these directions is
in progress.

(C3)
This implies that the x0 → 0 limit can not be taken before integrating over y, as this induces a new large-y, i.e. short-time
divergence. Taking this limit before integration, and regularizing the new divergence with the large-y cutoff Λ would lead to a
wrong result. This is expected as the scaling of the result in terms of x0 depends on H, thus inducing a ln(x0) term at order ε.

We anticipate here that ZA and ZC have a well-deﬁned x0 → 0 limit, and only ZB has a divergence (as shown later). The
next step consists in computing these three integrals over y, taking the limit of small x0, and performing the inverse Laplace
transforms w.r.t. s1 and s2. The order of these manipulations can sometimes be inverted to simplify the calculations.

In the ﬁrst term of Eq. (C8) it is possible to take the x0 → 0 limit inside the integral, as this integrand converges fast enough

integral cancel. The diverging part when x0 → 0 is now the term outside the integral and the integral has a ﬁnite limit when
x0 → 0. To proceed, denote K := e−m1

We now need a series of Inverse Laplace transforms obtained in appendix G. To deal with the double Laplace inversion, we start
with formula (G6) and use the special function J deﬁned in Eq. (G2). Using commutativity of derivation and integration with

Appendix E: Distribution of the maximum of the fractional BM

22

Similarly to the distribution of tmax, the distribution of m can be computed from the path integral Z +(m1, t1, x0, m2, t2).

This is done by taking the limit of small x0, the integral over m2 and the integral over t1 at t1 + t2 = T ﬁxed,

H (m) = lim

dt Z +(m, t, x0, m2, T − t) .

(E1)

It is useful to note that the integration over t = t1 at ﬁxed T = t1 + t2 can be replaced by taking the Laplace transform of Z +
at equal arguments (s1 = s2 = s) and then performing the inverse Laplace transform s → T . The normalisation Z N (T, x0) is
the same as the one for the distribution of P T
being the integrals over m2 > 0 and t1 ∈ [0, T ].

H (t); expanding in ε thus gives the same structure as (D4), with the(cid:82) symbol now

We start with the contribution of Zγ. As before, the integral over m2 of ZA vanishes, so this term does not contribute. The

correction from ZB can be computed starting with Eq. (C21), taken at equal Laplace variables (i.e. s1 = s2 = s),

We changed the variable in G from z to y as it does not change
the result at order ε and since it is more consistent in terms of

dimensions. The function G is given by

G(y) = I(y) + (y2 − 2)(cid:2)ln(2y2) + γE

(E16)
The function I is regular at y = 0, and its asymptotic behavior
is given in Eq. (G5); this gives the asymptotics for G as

(cid:3) ;

(cid:40)−2 ln(y)

−4 ln(y)

G(y) ∼

for y → ∞
for y → 0 .

(E17)

Since these asymptotics are logarithmic new power laws are
obtained for the density distribution, both at m → 0 and m →
∞, which multiply the Gaussian term, with

The constant term in Eq. (E12) is ﬁxed by normalisation. In-
stead of computing it at order ε, we can also evaluate it nu-
merically such that (E15) is exactly normalized, and not only
at order ε. This is appropriate for numerical checks and the
procedure we adopted for the latter.

Appendix F: Survival distribution

To compute the survival probability up to time T of a fBm
starting in m, we need to take the primitive function w.r.t. m
of (E12). We can deal with the terms involving I using (G3);
the difﬁcult part comes from

dm e− m2

2 (2 − m2) ln(m) .

(F1)

To deal with this integration, we consider e− m2
2 ma, compute
the primitive function w.r.t. m, and then take the derivative
w.r.t. a, at a = 0 and a = 2.

The ﬁnal result can be written as

This can be checked by Taylor expansion. With that, and the deﬁnition of J in Eq. (G2), we obtain the announced result (G11).
Equation (G10) is obtained from there by taking one derivative.

Appendix H: Check of the covariance function

As a check of the action, we computed the two-point correlation function (i.e. the covariance function). The needed path

integral is

At ﬁrst order in ε, we can expand this path integral using Eq. (14) ,

(cid:104)Xt1Xt2(cid:105) = (cid:104)Xt1Xt2(cid:105)0 +

ε
2

dτ1

dτ2

τ1+τ

Here, averages (cid:104)•(cid:105)0 are performed with the action S0[X] given in Eq. (20), i.e. the action of standard Brownian motion with
diffusive constant Dε,τ = 1 + 2ε[1 + ln(τ )] + O(ε2). This action is quadratic, and using Wick contractions allows us to write

˙Xτ2(cid:105)0 = 4(cid:0) min(t1, t2)δ(τ1 − τ2) + θ(t1 − τ1)θ(t2 − τ2) + θ(t1 − τ2)θ(t2 − τ1)(cid:1) + O(ε) .

(cid:104)Xt1 Xt2

˙Xτ1

(H3)

In this equation, we used only the zeroth order for the diffusive constant (Dε,τ = 1 + O(ε)); the ﬁrst term does not contribute
since τ1 and τ2 do not coincide due to the time regularization.

The last two terms require to compute the integrals

(cid:90) min(t1,t2−τ )

(cid:90) t2

(cid:90) min(t2,t1−τ )

τ1+τ

= t1 ln(t1) + t2 ln(t2) − |t1 − t2| ln|t1 − t2| − 2 min(t1, t2)(ln(τ ) + 1) .

We now sum all contributions to order ε, the Brownian result with the rescaled diffusive constant being (cid:104)Xt1Xt2(cid:105)0 =
2Dε,τ min(t1, t2). This gives
(cid:104)Xt1Xt2(cid:105) = 2Dε,τ min(t1, t2) + 2ε (t1 ln(t1) + t2 ln(t2) − |t1 − t2| ln|t1 − t2|) − 4ε min(t1, t2)(ln(τ ) + 1) + O(ε2)

= 2 min(t1, t2) + 2ε (t1 ln(t1) + t2 ln(t2) − |t1 − t2| ln|t1 − t2|) + O(ε2)
= t1+2ε

− |t1 − t2|1+2ε + O(ε2) .

+ t1+2ε

The τ dependence in the diffusive constant and in the ﬁrst correction to the action cancel, and we recover the fBm correlation
function at ﬁrst order in ε. We also see that the correction to the diffusive constant is equivalent to setting ln(τ ) = −1.
