A Numerical Study of Long-Range Magnetic Impacts during

Coronal Mass Ejections

ABSTRACT

With the global view and high-cadence observations from SDO/AIA and
STEREO, many spatially separated solar eruptive events appear to be coupled.
However, the mechanisms for “sympathetic” events are still largely unknown.
In this study, we investigate the impact of an erupting ﬂux rope on surround-
ing solar structures through large-scale magnetic coupling. We build a realistic
environment of the solar corona on 2011 February 15 using a global magnetohy-
drodynamics (MHD) model and initiate coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in active
region (AR) 11158 by inserting Gibson-Low analytical ﬂux ropes. We show that
a CME’s impact on the surrounding structures depends not only on the magnetic
strength of these structures and their distance to the source region, but also on
the interaction between the CME with the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld. Within the
CME expansion domain where the ﬂux rope ﬁeld directly interacts with the so-
lar structures, expansion-induced reconnection often modiﬁes the overlying ﬁeld,
thereby increasing the decay index. This eﬀect may provide a primary coupling
mechanism underlying the sympathetic eruptions. The magnitude of the impact
is found to depend on the orientation of the erupting ﬂux rope, with the largest
impacts occurring when the ﬂux rope is favorably oriented for reconnecting with
the surrounding regions. Outside the CME expansion domain, the inﬂuence of
the CME is mainly through ﬁeld line compression or post-eruption relaxation.
Based on our numerical experiments, we discuss a way to quantify the eruption
impact, which could be useful for forecasting purposes.

Introduction

The term “sympathetic solar events” refers to sequences of eruptions from distinct
regions on the Sun with apparently causal relations. Sympathetic solar events were reported
even before the space age (e.g.,Richardson 1951; Becker 1958). However, due to a lack
of observational evidence, the coupling mechanism remained speculative. With the launch
of Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO; Kaiser 2005) and Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012), we have, for the ﬁrst time, a (nearly) complete
coverage of the Sun from three diﬀerent perspectives1, which gives us an unprecedented
opportunity to investigate sympathetic events on a global scale. A dozen solar sympathetic
events have been reported so far in solar cycle 24, which are typically in the form of coupled
quiescent ﬁlament eruptions (e.g., Schrijver & Title 2011; Yang et al. 2012) or coupled active
region/ﬁlament eruptions (e.g., Schrijver et al. 2011, 2013; Shen et al. 2012). Compared
with the extensively studied initiation mechanisms for isolated events (see, e.g., Forbes et
al. 2006; Kliem et al. 2014, and references therein), the mechanisms by which sympathetic
events are coupled remain largely unknown. Few allegedly sympathetic events have been
extensively analyzed/modeled, so the physical mechanisms of how perturbations propagate
from one region to another and how they interact with the background magnetic ﬁeld and
trigger an eruption remain unknown.

Sympathetic events may also present important implications in understanding the space
weather, whose two important elements, non-recurrent geomagnetic storms and solar ener-
getic particles (SEPs), are largely attributable to coronal mass ejections (CMEs, see, e.g.,
Gosling 1993). When propagating into the solar wind, sympathetic events are prone to
CME-CME interaction (e.g., Lugaz et al. 2008; Lugaz et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014a). Such
interactions may signiﬁcantly modify the structure of the CME-driven shock wave and the
properties of the interplanetary CME (ICME), and therefore aﬀect the potential of space
weather eﬀects (e.g., Liu et al. 2012; M¨ostl et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014b). Interactions between
CMEs from the same active region have often been discussed (e.g., Lugaz et al. 2005b, 2007;
Xiong et al. 2006; Lugaz et al. 2013), but CMEs can be spatially extended and those from
distant regions may also interact, adding complexity to solar wind data (e.g., Temmer et al.
2012). It is also possible that sympathetic events may play a role in SEP events observed at
widely separate locations (e.g., Richardson et al. 2014; G´omez-Herrero et al. 2015).

Statistical studies suggest that coupling between near-simultaneous events likely exists.
By investigating all M5 and above ﬂares observed by SDO using superposed-epoch analysis,

and until they drift past the quadrature points once again around mid-May 2019.

Schrijver & Higgins (2015) found increased rate of ﬂaring and ﬁlament eruptions within the
ﬁrst 4 hours, even at locations more than 20◦ away from the primary ﬂare. Fu & Welsch
(2015) found an increase in the M- and X-class ﬂaring rates following new active region
emergence. A recent study ﬁnds that 90% and 79% of X-ﬂares occurred in clusters of 2 or
more with the mean separation of ∼1 day in solar cycle 22 and 23, respectively (A. M. Title,
private communication). These studies support the existence of solar sympathy but do not
identify the coupling mechanisms. In this study, we would like to establish whether such
coupling really exists, and if so, the physical mechanisms responsible.

To uncover the coupling mechanisms in solar sympathetic events, two approaches have
typically been used in past studies. One approach involves using a topological analysis of
the magnetic ﬁeld, as applied to coronal ﬁeld extrapolations that employ photospheric mag-
netograms as boundary conditions (e.g., PFSS: potential ﬁeld source surface model). One
well-studied example is the series of events occurring on 2010 August 1-2. A sequence of
apparently coupled eruptions was observed at widely separated locations that spanned a full
hemisphere of the Sun. From a comprehensive analysis of the observational data from SDO
and STEREO for the 2010 August 1-2 eruptions, Schrijver & Title (2011) argued that the
three active regions involved are connected by topological elements present in the magnetic
ﬁeld (i.e., separatrix surfaces, separators, and quasi-separatrix layers). A detailed topological
analysis of the source-surface background ﬁeld by Titov et al. (2012) also strongly supports
the idea that these structural features were involved in generating sympathetic eruptions for
the 2010 August 1-2 events. The other approach is through numerical modeling. T¨or¨ok et
al. (2011) reproduce some important aspects of the global sympathetic event on 2010 August
1 using an idealized arrangement of ﬂux ropes in a zero-β simulation, and found that the
presence of a pseudo-streamer is important for producing the “twin-ﬁlament” eruptions seen
in the observations. Also, Lynch & Edmondson (2013) present a 2.5D magnetohydrodynam-
ics (MHD) simulation of sympathetic magnetic breakout eruptions from a pseudo-streamer
source region.

One major diﬃculty in constructing more realistic three-dimensional (3D) global MHD
models of sympathetic events is that additional assumptions are needed to establish how
unstable the triggered eruption might be. However, these assumptions are very hard to con-
strain from the available observations. Therefore, instead of building a single realistic case,
we build a realistic background coronal environment for 2011 February 15 and investigate
quantitatively how the eruption of ﬂux ropes having various strengths and orientations might
impact the magnetic structures in the near and remote neighborhood of the eruption. With
this study, we can achieve a better understanding about the role of large-scale magnetic cou-
pling during solar sympathetic events and can thereby explore several candidate mechanisms
for solar sympathy.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the global MHD model
Alfv´en Wave Solar Model (AWSoM) used to construct the background solar wind and
Gibson-Low (GL) ﬂux rope model for the CME initiation. In Section 3, we describe the
methods that are used for analyzing the simulation data in this study. The simulation
results are shown in Section 4, followed by the discussion and summary in Section 5.

2. Model

In this study, we utilize the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) developed at
the University of Michigan, which provides a high-performance computational capability to
simulate the space weather environment from the upper solar chromosphere to the Earth’s
upper atmosphere and/or the outer heliosphere (T´oth et al. 2005, 2012). The framework con-
tains several components that represent diﬀerent physical domains of the space environment
and each physics domain has several models available. We will mainly focus on the Solar
Corona (SC), Inner Heliosphere (IH), and Eruptive Event generator (EE) components. For
SC/IH, the Block-Adaptive-Tree-Solarwind-Roe-Upwind-Scheme (BATS-R-US) code plays
a central role in solving the MHD equations that describe the plasmas in the heliosphere
(Powell et al. 1999).

2.1. Alfv´en Wave Solar Model

The SC model used in this study is the newly developed AWSoM (van der Holst et al.
2014), which is a data-driven model with a domain extending from the upper chromosphere
to the corona and heliosphere. A steady-state solar wind solution is obtained with the local
time stepping and second-order shock-capturing scheme (T´oth et al. 2012). In order to con-
struct a realistic coronal environment, the inner boundary condition of the magnetic ﬁeld
is speciﬁed by a global magnetic map sampled from an evolving photospheric ﬂux trans-
port model (Schrijver & DeRosa 2003). The inner boundary conditions of electron and
proton temperature Te and Ti and number density n are assumed at Te = Ti = 50,000 K
and n =2×1017 m−3, respectively. The overestimated density at the inner boundary allows
chromospheric evaporation to self-consistently populate the upper chromosphere with an ap-
propriately high density, as found on the Sun. The inner boundary density and temperature
do not otherwise have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the global solution (Lionello et al. 2009).
The initial conditions for the solar wind plasma are speciﬁed by the Parker solution (Parker
1958), while the initial magnetic ﬁeld is based on the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS)
model with the Finite Diﬀerence Iterative Potential Solver (FDIPS, T´oth et al. 2011).

– 5 –

Alfv´en waves are driven at the inner boundary with the Poynting ﬂux scaling with the
surface magnetic ﬁeld. The solar wind is heated by Alfv´en wave dissipation and accelerated
by thermal and Alfv´en wave pressure. Electron heat conduction (both collisional and colli-
sionless) and radiative cooling are also included in the model. These energy transport terms
are important for self-consistently creating the solar transition region. In order to produce
physically correct solar wind and CME structures, such as shocks, the electron and proton
temperatures are treated separately (Manchester et al. 2012; Jin et al. 2013). Thus, while the
electrons and protons are assumed to have the same bulk velocity, heat conduction is applied
only to the electrons, owing to their much higher thermal velocity. By using physically con-
sistent treatment of wave reﬂection, dissipation, and heat partitioning between the electrons
and protons, the AWSoM showed the capability to reproduce the solar corona environment
with only 3 free parameters that determine Poynting ﬂux (SA/B), wave dissipation length
(L⊥

B), and stochastic heating parameter (hS) (van der Holst et al. 2014).

√

The SC model uses a 3D spherical grid from 1 R(cid:12) to 24 R(cid:12). The grid blocks consist
of 6×4×4 mesh cells. The smallest radial cell size is ∼10−3 R(cid:12) at the Sun, allowing the
steep density and temperature gradients in the upper chromosphere to be resolved. The
largest radial cell size at the outer boundary of SC is ∼1 R(cid:12). Below r = 1.7 R(cid:12), the angular
resolution is ∼1.4◦. Above this radius, the grid coarsens by one level to ∼2.8◦. The IH model
uses a Cartesian grid to reach 250 R(cid:12) with grid blocks consisting of 4×4×4 mesh cells. The
smallest cell size in IH is ∼10−1 R(cid:12) and the largest cell size is ∼8 R(cid:12). For both the SC and
IH, adaptive mesh reﬁnement (AMR) is performed to resolve the heliospheric current sheet
(HCS). The number of total cells is ∼3×106 in SC, and ∼1×106 in IH. In steady-state, both
the SC and IH domains are in heliographic coordinates (rotating at the Carrington rotation
rate).

2.2. Gibson-Low Flux Rope Model

In this study, we initiate CMEs using the analytical Gibson-Low (GL; Gibson & Low
1998) ﬂux rope model implemented in the Eruptive Event Generator Gibson Low (EEGGL)
module. This ﬂux rope model has been successfully used in numerous studies modeling CMEs
(e.g., Manchester et al. 2004a,b; Lugaz et al. 2005a,b; Schmidt & Ofman 2010; Manchester
et al. 2014). Analytical proﬁles of the GL ﬂux rope are obtained by ﬁnding a solution to
the magnetohydrostatic equation (∇ × B) × B − ∇p − ρg = 0 and the solenoidal condition
∇ · B = 0. This solution is derived by applying a mathematical stretching transformation
r → r − a to an axisymmetric, spherical ball of twisted magnetic ﬂux b with diameter r0
centered relative to the heliospheric coordinate system at r = r1. The ﬁeld of b can be

– 6 –

expressed by a scalar function A and a free parameter a1 to determine the magnetic ﬁeld
strength. The full derivation of b can be found in the Appendix of Lites et al. (1995).
Following the transformation, the GL ﬂux rope ﬁeld takes the form:

BGL(r, θ, φ) =

where F (r) = GM/r2, G is the gravitational constant and M is the solar mass. The
transformed ﬂux rope appears as a tear-drop shape of twisted magnetic ﬂux. At the same
time, Lorentz forces are introduced, which leads to a density-depleted cavity in the upper
portion and a dense core at the lower portion of the ﬂux rope. This ﬂux rope structure helps
to reproduce the 3-part density structure of the CME in the observation (Illing & Hundhausen
1985). However, the dense core in the GL ﬂux rope is not highly structured as is observed.
The GL ﬂux rope and contained plasma are then superposed onto the steady-state solar
corona solution: i.e. ρ = ρ0 + ρGL, B = B0 + BGL, p = p0 + pGL. The combined background-
ﬂux rope system is in a state of force imbalance (due to the insuﬃcient background plasma
pressure to oﬀset the magnetic pressure of the ﬂux rope), and thus erupts immediately when
the numerical model is advanced forward in time. There are several advantages of using this
unstable ﬂux rope for this study. First, the eruption does not require time for energy to
build up that is computationally expensive. Second, the GL ﬂux rope enables us to estimate
the total magnetic energy added to the system, therefore facilitates a parameter study.

The initial out-of-equilibrium ﬂux rope eruption does have some artifacts that should
be noted. Due to the force imbalance, the initial acceleration process in the source region
may not be captured correctly in the simulation. In this study, we focused on the dynamic
evolution of surrounding solar structures rather than the eruption itself. The initial arbitrary
acceleration in the source region therefore has limited inﬂuence on these structures due to
the long distance and the cumulative eﬀect of magnetic reconnection between the erupting

– 7 –

ﬂux rope and the ambient ﬁelds. However, we noticed that the strong acceleration in the be-
ginning may lead to stronger fast-mode waves/shock-waves than those in the realistic events.
Therefore, the impact caused by waves (see §4.2.2) may be overestimated in this study. To
overcome this drawback, a more self-consistent modeling of pre-eruptive conﬁgurations is
needed (e.g., Titov et al. 2014).

The GL ﬂux rope is mainly controlled by four parameters: the stretching parameter a
determines the shape of the ﬂux rope, the distance of torus center from the center of the Sun
r1 determines the initial position of the ﬂux rope before it is stretched, the radius of the ﬂux
rope torus r0 determines the size of the ﬂux rope, and the ﬂux rope ﬁeld strength parameter
a1 determines the magnetic strength of the ﬂux rope. The location (longitude and latitude)
and orientation of the ﬂux rope are also speciﬁed in the simulation. For this study, we ﬁx
three parameters (a = 0.3, r0 = 0.3, r1 = 1.4) and location of the ﬂux rope. We conducted
a total of 11 runs with diﬀerent ﬂux rope a1 and orientations. The GL ﬂux rope parameters
used in this study are shown in §3.

3. Method

3.1. Reconstruction of the Solar Corona

By using the global map, as taken from the time-evolving surface ﬂux transport model
of Schrijver & DeRosa (2003) on 2011 February 15 00:04:00 UT, and running AWSoM in
local time-stepping mode that allows fast convergence, a steady-state MHD solution of the
solar corona at that time can be obtained. For a complete list of model parameters of the
AWSoM, refer to the Table 1 of van der Holst et al. (2014). Here, we use all parameters
except (SA/B)(cid:12), which controls the Poynting ﬂux passing through the surface of the Sun.
A larger value of this parameter increases the level of coronal heating and therefore opens
up more ﬁeld into the heliosphere, leading to larger coronal holes in the synthesized extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) images. We chose (SA/B)(cid:12) = 1.2 × 106 W m −2 T−1 to get a better
match between the synthesized and observed EUV images near the Sun. In Figure 1, the
model density, temperature, and the instrumental response functions constructed from the
CHIANTI 7.1 atomic database (Dere et al. 1997; Landi et al. 2013) are used to synthesize
EUV images, which are then compared with the EUV observations from SDO/Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and STEREO/Extreme UltraViolet Imager
(EUVI; Howard et al. 2008). Three EUV spectral bands (AIA 211 ˚A EUVIA 171 ˚A and
EUVIB 195 ˚A) are selected that cover the temperature range from 1 MK to 2 MK. It is
evident in the ﬁgure that emission from all the major active regions and coronal holes is
reproduced in the synthesized AIA 211 ˚A image. However, in the synthesized STA/STB

– 8 –

images, several active regions are missing due to the outdated far-side magnetic map (STA
was ∼87◦ ahead of Earth and STB was ∼94◦ behind Earth at that time). Identical log scales
are used for both the observed and synthesized images.

In order to further validate the steady-state background solar wind, we also compare
the modeled unsigned openﬂux with that measured at 1 AU by the in situ OMNI database2.
Under the assumption of constant interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) |Br| in latitude (Suess
et al. 1996; Suess & Smith 1996), the total unsigned openﬂux is calculated as F1AU =
4πr2|Br|, where |Br| is averaged over one Carrington rotation. The unsigned openﬂux in
the database is calculated to be 5.73× 1022 Mx, while the unsigned openﬂux in the model is
5.33 × 1022 Mx.

In Figure 2, we compare the initial potential ﬁeld (blue) with the relaxed, steady-state
MHD solution (red) from AWSoM. Carrington coordinates are used for all the 3D simulation
data in this study. We select the same foot points for both the potential and MHD ﬁeld lines
in the ﬁgure. In the left panel, the closed ﬁeld near the Sun is shown with the isosurface
showing the current density |J| = 2× 10−7 A m−2. In general, the PFSS and MHD solutions
are very similar for small loops, but the larger loops in the MHD solution are more radially
stretched. This result is consistent with a study by Riley et al. (2006). In the right panel,
the helmet streamer belt in the two solutions may be compared. The helmet streamer ﬁeld
lines are selected according to the HCS locations at 2.5 R(cid:12) for PFSS solution and 3.0 R(cid:12) for
MHD solution. In addition to being stretched to a higher altitude, the MHD helmet streamer
belt has also reached higher latitudes at certain places than the corresponding potential ﬁeld
solution.

3.2. Quantifying the Eruption Impact

A GL ﬂux rope located within active region (AR) 11158 is inserted into the model.
The location is marked as “CME” in Figure 3. The insertion of the ﬂux rope adds a mass
of 2.4×1016 g and a magnetic energy 4.1×1032 ergs to the solar corona3, both of which are
typical parameters associated with X-class ﬂare/CME systems (e.g., Emslie et al. 2005). The
simulation is evolved forward in time for 1 hour after ﬂux rope insertion, during which time
CME passes through the model corona. The other active regions and ﬁlament channels on

2The OMNI database (obtained from the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC)) provides selected
data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), Wind, Geotail, and IMP8 spacecraft (IMP8 ceased
operation on October 7, 2006).

– 9 –

disk at the time of the eruption are shown in Figure 3. In the following, we brieﬂy describe
these solar structures, quantify the eruption impact, and summarize the simulation runs.

3.2.1. Selection of the Solar Structures

The objective is to investigate the impact of a CME on all the active regions (with or
without an AR number), ﬁlament channels, and some quiet Sun regions on disk at the time
of the liftoﬀ of the CME. In total, there are 8 active regions, 5 ﬁlament channels, and 2
quiet Sun regions, all of which are labeled in the left panel of Figure 3. The right panel of
Figure 3 shows the Hα observation, in which the ﬁlament channels are evident. Note that the
ﬁlament channels in this simulation do not contain ﬂux ropes. Instead, they are modeled by
the MHD solution with near-potential ﬁelds. Therefore, the ﬁlament channels in this study
are essentially referred to diﬀuse region polarity inversion lines (PILs).

3.2.2. Decay Index

To characterize the impact of the eruption on the various structures, we evaluate the

decay index IDecay before and after the eruption:

IDecay = −d log B
d log h

(4)

where B is the magnetic ﬁeld strength and h is the height above the solar surface. The decay
index represents how fast the overlying ﬁeld decays with height, which is a key factor for
determining when the instabilities happen. Faster decay corresponds to a lesser conﬁning
force, which in turn makes eruptions more likely. The critical decay index Icrit, above which
the ﬂux rope becomes unstable, depends on the ﬂux rope conﬁguration: 1.0 for a straight
line current (van Tend & Kuperus 1978) and 1.5 for a toroidal current (Bateman 1978).
Several observational studies ﬁnd that active regions with a larger decay index are more
likely to generate CMEs (e.g., Liu 2008). In a statistical study, Filippov & Zagnetko (2008)
ﬁnd that source regions for erupted ﬁlaments have a larger decay index than those for stable
ﬁlaments. Theoretical and numerical studies suggest that a critical decay index between
1.0 and 2.0 is a good approximation for solar corona conditions under various assumptions
(e.g., Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; Aulanier et al. 2010; D´emoulin & Aulanier 2010). In this study,
we extract the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle above the PIL of diﬀerent solar structures. We then
calculate the decay index for the selected solar structures between 5 Mm and 100 Mm and
track its evolution after the eruption, from which we characterize to what extent the solar
structures are aﬀected by the CME.

– 10 –

3.2.3.

Impact Factor

Because the plasma parameters (e.g., ﬁeld, velocity, pressure, density) may undergo
dramatic changes during the eruption, the decay index alone may not fully characterize the
CME’s impact magnitude on diﬀerent structures.
In order to quantify the impact more
comprehensively, we introduce the following two impact factors. The ﬁrst is the sum of
relative perturbations in relevant physical quantities:

Fimp1,i =

· (∆ρi + ∆Bi + ∆Pi + ∆FLorentz,i + ∆Ui + ∆IDecay,i + ∆IFinal,i)

where ρ, B, P , FLorentz, and U represent density, total magnetic ﬁeld, total pressure, Lorentz

force, and total velocity, respectively. ∆ρi =
∆IDecay,i have similar deﬁnitions, while FLorentz = |J × B|/B2. ∆IFinal =
where IFinal refers to the decay index derived from the relaxed steady-state solution calculated
from the modiﬁed inner boundary map, which is comprised of the global magnetic map plus
the contribution of the GL ﬂux rope. This term describes how close the decay index (at t
= 1 hour) is to the ﬁnal relaxed MHD solution. The impact factor Fimp1 thus takes into
account changes in 7 diﬀerent impact quantities over the course of the ﬁrst hour of evolution.
All the valuables are averaged between 5 and 100 Mm, and are weighted equally.

The second impact factor has a similar deﬁnition but is normalized to the maximum
relative impact seen within the 15 selected regions. Also a new quantity (penetration height)
is added:

The penetration height Hi is deﬁned as the lowest altitude where the magnetic ﬁeld magni-
tude changes by at least 10% relative to the pre-eruption ﬁeld. This impact factor can vary
from 0 (no impact) to 1 (largest impact among structures). As we can see from the equations,
the ﬁrst impact factor is useful when comparing the impact amongst the set of simulation
runs with diﬀerent initial ﬂux rope parameters. The second impact factor is useful when
comparing the impact of the CME on the various structures in the same simulation run.

3.3. Summary of the Simulation Runs

In Table 1, we summarize the various simulation runs, in which the calculations were
initialized with diﬀerent GL ﬂux rope parameters. The two major parameters that we
experimented with are the initial orientation angle and the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the
ﬂux rope. As shown in Table 1, for Runs 1–7, the ﬂux rope orientation angle various between
90◦ and 270◦, allowing the study of the dependence of the impact on orientation. For Runs
1, 8, 9, and 11, only the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the ﬂux rope is varied, which enables
the energy dependence of the impact to be assessed. The convention used here is that the
an orientation angle of 0◦ means that the foot points of the ﬂux rope are along the East-
West direction with the positive polarity at East, while an orientation angle of 180◦ has the
positive polarity to the West. The orientation angle increases in a clockwise fashion.

4. Results

4.1. Dynamic Evolution after the Eruption

The corona evolves dramatically after the eruption. In Figure 4, we show the plasma-
β = 2µ0 · (pe + pi)/B2 at 2.5 R(cid:12) (a-c) and radial velocity at 42 Mm (d-f) for t = 0, 10, and
60 min, respectively. In general, the high plasma-β regions at 2.5 R(cid:12) approximate the HCS
location. From the evolution of the plasma-β, we can see clearly that the eruption changes
the large-scale magnetic conﬁguration, and thus the HCS, signiﬁcantly. After an hour of
evolution, the HCS has still not relaxed to the original state at t = 0. The major changes
occur around ±50◦ in longitude around the CME source region (AR 11158). In that region,
the HCS locations are pushed to higher latitudes both in the north and south hemispheres.

In Figure 4(d)-(f), we show the radial velocity evolution at 42 Mm, which approximately
resembles the height of the Dopplergram observed by spectral lines with log T = 5.5 – 6.0
(Guo et al. 2009). At t = 10 min, we can see clearly the strong upward motion inside the
expanding CME “bubble”, in front of which the downward motion is evident with a maximum
value of ∼100 km s−1 (Figure 4(e)). The downward motion is caused by the downward push
of the CME during its expansion into the corona. This same phenomenon was observed to
occur in AR 11158 by Harra et al. (2011) and Veronig et al. (2011) using data from the
Hinode/EUV imaging spectrometer (EIS; Culhane et al. 2007) during an M1.6 ﬂare/CME
event on 2011 February 16. The upward motion is induced by the radial propagation of the
CME and is more often observed in the Dopplergrams after CMEs (e.g., Harra et al. 2007;
Imada et al. 2007; Jin et al. 2009; Tian et al. 2012). At t = 1 hour, the plasma speed has
mostly decreased back to the pre-event magnitude, except for a small area around the CME

– 12 –

source region where some upward motion is still evident (∼70 km s−1).

In order to illustrate the global magnetic conﬁguration change during the eruption, we
further show in Figure 5 the 3D ﬁeld conﬁguration at t = 0 (left column) and 15 min (right
column) from three diﬀerent points of view (an animation is available online). The lines
represent ﬂux rope ﬁeld lines (red), large-scale helmet streamers (white), and ﬁeld lines from
surrounding active regions/open ﬁeld (green). At t = 15 min, the ﬂux rope structure is a
mix of three diﬀerent ensembles (colors) of ﬁeld lines due to magnetic reconnection. Also,
the large-scale helmet streamers around the CME ﬂux rope are signiﬁcantly disturbed, either
by ﬁeld line compression or reconnection.

4.2. Diﬀerent Types of CME Impact

By analyzing the simulation data using the method described in §3, we can identify
the factors that determine the CME impact. Ideally, we expect that the CME impact is
determined by the distance from the source region as well as by the magnetic ﬁeld strength
of the structures. In Figure 6, we show two scatter plots between the impact factors (deﬁned
in §3) as a function of the distance (Figure 6(a)) and magnetic ﬁeld strength (Figure 6(b))
based on the data from Run 1. Larger symbol sizes in the ﬁgure reﬂect stronger magnetic
ﬁeld strengths (Figure 6(a)), whereas in Figure 6(b), larger symbols indicate closer distances
to the source region. The magnetic ﬁeld strength is the average value between 5 Mm and
100 Mm in height. For display purposes, the impact factor Fimp1 is normalized by the largest
value. The general trend is that stronger CME impacts occur when the target region has
weaker ﬁeld strength, and especially when the target region is closer to the source region.
All regions with impact factor larger than 0.2 are located within 400 Mm from the source
region, while these regions can have a broad range of magnetic ﬁeld strengths. We now
discuss additional contributing factors such as magnetic ﬁeld line connectivity and topology.

The CME impact morphologies can be placed into three categories:

4.2.1. Type I: direct connection

This type of impact applies to the solar structures that the ﬂux rope expansion can
reach directly. Due to the direct interaction between the ﬂux rope magnetic ﬁeld and the
ﬁeld of the impacted solar structures, the severity of Type I impacts depends strongly on
the initial orientation of the ﬂux rope in the simulation. For the simulated CME erupting
from AR 11158 discussed here, we ﬁnd that regions that experience Type I impacts include

– 13 –

QR1, AR2, FC1, FC2, and AR8 (marked with red in Figure 3). In Figure 7, we show as an
example the Type I impact for AR2 (an animation is available online), in which we compare
the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration as well as the decay index with height for two diﬀerent ﬂux
rope orientations (Run 1 and 2).

At around 15 min after the eruption, the CME expansion reaches AR2 and starts to
interact with the AR2 magnetic ﬁeld. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show the global magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁguration at t = 15 min with selected ﬁeld lines to represent ﬂux rope (red), large-scale
helmet streamers (white), and ﬁeld lines from surrounding active regions and open ﬁeld
(green). A zoom-in view of AR2 can be found in Figure 7(c) and 7(d) with the background
showing the normalized Lorentz force and the coloring of the ﬁeld lines showing the height
information. In order to distinguish the ﬁeld line connectivity, the ﬁeld lines that reconnect
with the erupting ﬂux rope are shown in white color. For Run 1, we can see that the ﬂux rope
expansion induces more magnetic reconnections than the expansion in Run 2, as indicated
by the larger fraction of ﬁeld lines connecting AR2 and the CME source region in Run 1.
As a consequence, the reconnection in Run 1 removes more overlying ﬁeld from AR2 and
leads to a higher decay index with height (Figure 7(e) and 7(f)). Note that CME-induced
reconnection has been observed and simulated by van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. (2014). In the
decay index ﬁgure, we also show the PFSS solution as well as MHD ﬁnal solution (new
steady-state after ﬂux rope insertion) for comparison. For AR2, the PFSS and MHD ﬁnal
solutions overlap.

In Figure 8, another example of a Type I impact is shown for ﬁlament channels FC1 and
FC2, which are located southwest of the CME source region. Due to the weaker magnetic
ﬁeld strength above the ﬁlament channel (∼20 G at 5 Mm) compared with AR2 (∼35 G at
5 Mm), the CME has a larger and more substantial impact on these structures. Again, we
compare the results for two diﬀerent ﬂux rope orientations (Run 1 and 2). In contrast to
AR2, the impact on FC1 and FC2 is larger in Run 2 than in Run 1. As shown in the ﬁeld
line conﬁgurations shown in Figure 8(a) and 8(b), we ﬁnd that there are more open ﬁeld
lines created in Run 2 than in Run 1 for both FC1 and FC2 at t = 30 min, which in turn
leads to a greater change in the overlying ﬁeld strength and therefore a larger decay index.
Note that the decay index starts to decrease above ∼50 Mm for FC1 in the Run 2 case, an
eﬀect likely caused by the dramatically lower magnetic ﬁeld strength below 50 Mm. Also,
we notice that the decay index change for FC2 above 80 Mm is bigger for Run 1 than Run
2. For FC1 and FC2, we can see that the potential and MHD solutions are slightly diﬀerent,
with larger diﬀerences at higher altitude.

In order to further determine the magnitude of the impact as the ﬂux-rope orientation
changes, and to characterize when the impact is largest for diﬀerent solar structures, we

– 14 –

conduct a total of 7 simulation runs (Run 1–7) with diﬀerent ﬂux rope orientations, while
keeping the other ﬂux rope parameters ﬁxed, and calculate the impact factor Fimp1 for the
solar structures in each run. Figure 9 shows the orientation dependence of CME impact on
two structures with type I impacts (AR2 and AR8), and indicates that the magnitude of
impact changes signiﬁcantly in AR2 and AR8 with diﬀerent ﬂux rope orientations. For AR2,
the diﬀerence between the largest and smallest impact factor is ∼30%, whereas for AR8 the
diﬀerence is ∼40%. In the left panel of Figure 9, we mark the largest impact conﬁguration
for both AR2 (red) and AR8 (blue). The arrows in AR2 and AR8 show the orientation of
the active region (pointing from positive to negative polarity), while the arrows in the CME
source region show the orientations of the ﬂux rope with the largest impact. The results
shown here suggest that the largest impact occurs when the CME ﬂux rope orientation favors
reconnection with the impacted solar structures during the expansion phase.

In the numerical simulations, the interaction between the ﬂux rope and the surrounding
magnetic structure is traced through 3D ﬁeld evolution, however such information cannot be
easily obtained from observations. To make the simulation results more readily comparable
to observations, we now use the simulation data to synthesize time series of EUV images.
These synthesized images clearly reveal EUV waves, namely bright fronts that propagate on
a global scale, as seen in EUV images from EIT and AIA. Note that the EUV wave in the
2011 February 15 event was studied by Schrijver et al. (2011), Olmedo et al. (2012), and
Nitta et al. (2013a). Although there is some debate about the origin of EUV waves, there
seems to be a consensus that a single event could consist of both the “wave” (fast MHD
wave) and “non-wave” (CME structure) components (see recent reviews by Chen et al.
2005, Patsourakos & Vourlidas 2012, Liu & Ofman 2014, and Warmuth 2015). Which part
of the front represents which processes remains unclear, however. This is where numerical
experiments may help reduce the ambiguities of the observations.

We try diﬀerent ﬂux rope orientations and evaluate the properties of the ensuing EUV
waves. For this purpose, we select two simulation runs with moderate ﬂux rope energy and
initial orientation of 128◦ and 270◦ (Run 9 and 10). A moderate ﬂux rope energy is chosen
to approximately match the intensity enhancement of EUV waves in the observation, and
the two orientation angles were chosen to correspond to the maximum and minimum impact
factors for AR2 shown in Figure 9. Tri-ratio EUV images were then synthesized by dividing
two subsequent simulated images in selected wavelengths at times with an appropriate time
interval between them (t = 6 min / t = 4 min) for both runs, as shown in the left and middle
panels of Figure 10. The images are composites of AIA 211 ˚A (red), AIA 193 ˚A (green), and
AIA 171 ˚A (blue). The ratio in each channel is scaled to 1±0.3. Because these three ﬁlters
have the highest signal-to-noise ratio on AIA, the tri-ratio method serves as a useful tool
to investigate EUV waves (e.g., Downs et al. 2012) and eruptions (e.g., Nitta et al. 2013b).

– 15 –

Comparing the synthesized images in the two runs indicates that the outer front of the EUV
waves (marked by blue arrow) is quite similar for the two orientations, while certain areas
of the inner front (marked by red arrow) show a marked diﬀerence.

These diﬀerences can be interpreted with the assistance of 3D ﬁeld conﬁguration shown
in the right panel of Figure 10. The outer front has a fast-mode wave nature driven by the
eruption, which has been simulated in previous studies (e.g., Wu et al. 2001; Cohen et al.
2009; Downs et al. 2011; Downs et al. 2012). The intensity increase in the EUV bands
is caused by adiabatic compression, which can be seen as a density increase region in the
3D conﬁguration image (red surface). The inner front represents the expanding volume
of the ﬂux rope, where is the main site for reconnection between the ﬂux rope and the
surrounding ﬁelds. This wave/non-wave nature of EUV waves has also been found in the
previous numerical studies (Cohen et al. 2009; Downs et al. 2012). Behind that front is a
low density region (blue surface) with most of the ﬂux rope ﬁeld lines contained inside. The
intensity diﬀerence of the inner front near AR2 found in the two runs is due to magnetic
reconnection between the ﬂux rope and AR2 ﬁeld. When the ﬂux rope orientation is more
favorable to reconnection with AR2, as in Run9, the intensity increases. This eﬀect may be
used to identify the reconnection site in observations, and may also help to constrain the
orientation of the expanding ﬂux rope. Our result suggests that these numerical models may
help us diagnose the origin of the slow and late EUV fronts that brighten due to magnetic
reconnection (Guo et al. 2015).

4.2.2. Type II: indirect connection

This type of impact includes solar structures that the ﬂux rope cannot reach directly.
In contrast to the type I impact, we ﬁnd that Type II impacts do not signiﬁcantly depend as
much on the orientation of the ﬂux rope. In this study, the structures with Type II impacts
include AR1, AR3, AR4, AR5, FC3, FC4, FC5, and QR2 (marked with green in Figure 3).
As an example, we show the orientation dependence of the CME impact on AR1 in Figure
9. In contrast to Type I impacts, the calculated impact factor does not depend on the ﬂux
rope orientation, and thus does not involve pronounced magnetic reconnection.
Instead,
the impact is usually caused by ﬁeld line compression during the eruption (i.e., fast-mode
waves). Because no reconnection is involved, the decay index decreases slightly during the
compression process and relaxes back to the pre-event state after the wave passage.

Another mechanism that can cause Type II impacts is through the recovery phase4

4The recovery phase refers to the evolution after the main phase of the CME impact. The main phase is

– 16 –

evolution. An example is shown in Figure 11, in which we show the magnetic ﬁeld evolution
of AR5 during the hour after the eruption. We can see that after the main phase of CME
impact (t = 8 min), the ﬁeld lines start to relax back to the original state. However, the
ﬁeld of AR5 starts to expand again after t = 26 min and keeps changing at t = 60 min.
This evolution is induced by the large-scale structure changing at higher altitudes during
the CME propagation. The ﬁeld lines above AR5 are stretched during this process, which
leads to a larger pressure gradient that causes the lower ﬁeld to expand again in the recovery
phase. Our simulation suggests that although the main phase of CME impact only lasts for
several minutes, the post-eruption reconﬁguration can last for hours after the eruption. The
fact that the expansion in the recovery phase causes an increase in the decay index shows
that this post-eruption reconﬁguration process could play an important role for some of the
solar sympathetic events.

4.2.3. Type III: hybrid wave-reconnection coupling

Type III impacts are hybrids between Type I and Type II. Their evolution does depend
on the orientation of the ﬂux rope, but the inﬂuence is less pronounced than Type I impacts.
For example, the eﬀects on AR6 and AR7 (marked with blue in Figure 3), which are not
directly connected to the source region, occur as a result of their proximity to AR2, which
we classiﬁed earlier as having Type I impact. The interaction between Type III structures
and the CME often occur via nearby structures possessing Type I impacts. Because the
magnetic conﬁguration can be quite diﬀerent for Type I impacts under diﬀerent ﬂux rope
orientations, this diﬀerence may change the magnetic conﬁguration of regions showing Type
III impacts as a result. But due to the indirect nature, the inﬂuence of orientation is less
evident than for the Type I impacts. In Figure 9, we show the orientation dependence of
the CME impact on AR6 as an example.

4.3. Energy Dependence

Another factor that may inﬂuence CME impacts is the energy of the eruption. In order
to investigate the energy dependence of the CME impact on diﬀerent structures, we change
a1 parameter in Equation (2) and (3) while keeping the other parameters ﬁxed. Run 1, 8,
9, and 11 possess four diﬀerent energy inputs, covering a range spanning a factor of about
40: 1.13×1031, 4.12×1031, 1.23×1032, and 4.06×1032 ergs. For each run, we calculate the

deﬁned as when the average normalized Lorentz force in the active region reaches maximum in the simulation.

– 17 –

CME impact on the selected set of structures, as shown in Figure 12. As expected, the
magnitude of impact generally increases for larger energy input. An interesting ﬁnding is
that for most of the structures with Type II impacts, the magnitude of the impact and energy
input have a quasi-linear relationship, while for Type I and III structures, that relationship
is non-linear. According to the characteristics of diﬀerent impact types mentioned in §4.2, it
suggests that environments that facilitate magnetic reconnection between two regions cause
the impact factor to depend nonlinearly on the energy input. If no reconnection is involved
in the process, the impact magnitude increases linearly with the CME energy. We also ﬁnd
that all the remote regions feature the same impact types across all energies in this study.

We also try to relate the CME speeds with the corresponding impacts in the simulations.
The resulting CME speed for each energy input is shown in Figure 12 in the unit of km s−1.
The CME speed is deﬁned as the average speed of the outmost density enhancement front
between 30 and 60 minutes in the simulation. The CME speeds in our simulations range
from 411 km s−1 to 2607 km s−1. We also found that the square of the CME speed has a
linear relationship with the magnetic energy of the GL ﬂux rope.

4.4.

Inﬂuence of Field Topology

In previous sections, the connectivity between the eruptive ﬂux rope and the various
target features is determined by tracing and visualizing ﬁeld lines associated with the unsta-
ble ﬂux rope (e.g., in Figure 5 and 7). However, it is unclear how the boundary of the ﬂux
rope expansion is determined. Analyzing the large-scale ﬁeld topology provides additional
insight (e.g., Longcope 2005). In this study, we assume that the PFSS solution could be a
good estimation for the large-scale conﬁguration of the corona ﬁeld, which is presumed to
be mostly relaxed and thus close to the potential state. In Figure 13, we show the topologi-
cal structures calculated from the PFSS model, in order to better understand the magnetic
environment into which the CME ﬂux rope propagates. Figure 13(a) shows all null points,
spine lines, and separatrix surfaces from the PFSS ﬁeld, while Figure 13(b) shows only those
topological domains that directly connect to the CME source region. The methods used to
calculate these topological structures are described by Haynes & Parnell (2007, 2010), after
adapting for spherical geometrics. The very large yellow semi-transparent surface demar-
cates the boundary between the open and closed ﬂux in the PFSS model. The separatrix
surfaces evident underneath are topological domains associated with null points in the coro-
nal volume. The blue line shows the null line on the source surface, and approximates the
location of the base of the HCS. A detailed description of these topological features can be
found in Platten et al. (2014).

– 18 –

We ﬁnd that all the Type I impacts identiﬁed in the simulations occur within topological
domains that have direct connections with the CME source region. Considering the similarity
between the PFSS and MHD ﬁeld solution in this study (shown in Figure 2), this topology
analysis suggests that the erupting ﬂux rope does not easily break out of the domain of
self-contained ﬁeld from which it originates. PFSS models seem useful for identifying the
diﬀerent types of impacts on solar structures caused by an erupting ﬂux rope, however,
additional regions need to be analyzed in this way in order to more ﬁrmly establish this
possibility.

5. Summary & Conclusion

We have constructed a global solar coronal model for 2011 February 15, with the aim
of analyzing the eﬀects of a ﬂux-rope eruption from AR 11158 on the surrounding features
visible on the solar disk. Unstable CMEs having diﬀerent ﬂux rope parameters (e.g., orien-
tation, strength) were inserted into this model, allowing the dependence of the eruption on
these parameters to be investigated. The main conclusions are:

1. The impact of a solar eruption on the surrounding solar structures depends on the
distance and the magnetic strength of the impacted structures, as well as on the presence (or
absence) of a direct coupling mechanism between the CME ﬂux rope and the surrounding
large-scale magnetic ﬁeld. Within the CME expansion domain where the CME ﬂux rope
ﬁeld directly interacts with the solar structures, expansion induced reconnection eﬀectively
weakens the overlying ﬁeld, leading to an increase of decay index. This mechanism may
be responsible for coupled eruptions in certain solar sympathetic events. The magnitude of
the impact is found to depend on the orientation of the erupting ﬂux rope, with the largest
impact occurring when the CME ﬂux rope is favorably oriented for reconnecting with the
surrounding regions. Moreover, the magnitude of the impact appears to increase more weakly
than linearly with eruption energy.

2. Outside the CME expansion domain, the inﬂuence of the CME is mainly through ﬁeld
compression by fast-mode waves, with a magnitude that is roughly proportional to eruption
energy. Because no direct reconnection is involved, the decay index in the low corona always
decreases during the wave passage and largely relaxes back to the pre-event state thereafter.
Even with the energy input of an X-ﬂare/CME, the waves by themselves have limited impact
on a distant active region.

3. For certain structures outside the CME expansion domain, the inﬂuence of CME
can also occur through the post-eruption reconﬁguration of the large-scale ﬁeld that can

– 19 –

persist for hours. During this process, although the major impact of the CME has passed,
the magnetic ﬁeld over the structure continues to evolve, causing the decay index to slowly
increase. Therefore, it could be an important factor for certain solar sympathetic events.

Based on the results of this numerical study, we can summarize a list of factors that
may determine the CME impact on the diﬀerent solar structures: the distance from the
source region, overlying ﬁeld of the structure, the relative position of the structure to the
source region, the relative orientation of source region and impacted structure, the energy of
the eruption, and the topology of the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld. All of the above-mentioned
factors are measurable or can be derived from observations. Therefore, it appears possible to
establish an empirical relationship to describe the CME impact in future studies. If such an
empirical relationship were found, it could be used to determine regions that will experience
the greatest inﬂuence even before the actual eruption happens, which is potentially useful
for the purpose of space weather forecasting.

Fig. 2.— The comparison between the initial PFSS and ﬁnal steady-state MHD solution
of the 3D ﬁeld conﬁguration for near-Sun closed ﬁeld (left panel) and large-scale helmet
streamer belt (right panel). The blue ﬁeld lines represent the potential ﬁeld solution, and
the red ﬁeld lines represent the MHD solution. The green isosurface represents the current
density |J| = 2×10−7 A m−2. The helmet streamer ﬁeld lines are selected according to the
HCS locations at 2.5 R(cid:12) for PFSS solution and 3.0 R(cid:12) for MHD solution.

Fig. 5.— Magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration from three diﬀerent point of views at t = 0 (left
column) and t = 15 min (right column). Run 1 data is used. The red, white, and green
ﬁeld lines represent ﬂux rope ﬁeld lines, large-scale helmet streamers, and ﬁeld lines from
surrounding active regions and open ﬁeld. The coloring of ﬁeld lines at t = 15 min is
determined by the initial foot point location of individual ﬁeld lines. (An animation of this
ﬁgure is available online)

Fig. 6.— Impact factors Fimp1 and Fimp2 [Eq.(5) and Eq.(6)] as a function of (a) the distance
from the source region, and (b) magnetic ﬁeld strength of the structures. The colors represent
Type I (red), Type II (green), and Type III (blue) impacts described in §4.2. In panel (a),
larger symbol sizes represent stronger magnetic ﬁeld strengths, and in panel (b), the symbol
size indicates distance from the source region, with larger symbols corresponding to solar
structures that are closer.

Fig. 7.— Panels (a) and (b) show the global magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of AR2 at t = 15
min for Runs 1 and 2. The red, white, and green ﬁeld lines represent ﬂux rope ﬁeld lines,
large-scale helmet streamers, and ﬁeld lines from surrounding active regions and open ﬁeld,
respectively. Panels (c) and (d) show an enlarged view of AR2 as viewed from the side. The
background shows the normalized Lorentz force and the coloring of the ﬁeld lines shows the
height. The white ﬁeld lines represent the ﬁeld lines reconnected with the erupting ﬂux rope.
Panels (e) and (f) show plots of the magnetic ﬁeld strength and decay index along the height
between 5 and 100 Mm (black solid lines). The PFSS and MHD ﬁnal solutions are shown
with blue and red dashed lines (which overlap in this case), respectively. (An animation of
this ﬁgure is available online)

under diﬀerent ﬂux rope orientations (Run 1 and 2). Panels (a) and (b) show the zoom-in
view for FC1 and FC2. The background shows the normalized Lorentz force and the coloring
of the ﬁeld lines shows the height. The white ﬁeld lines represent the ﬁeld lines reconnected
with the erupting ﬂux rope. Panels (c) through (f) show the magnetic ﬁeld strength and
decay index along the height between 5 and 100 Mm (black solid lines). The PFSS and
MHD ﬁnal solutions are shown with blue and red dashed lines, respectively. (An animation
of this ﬁgure is available online)

Fig. 10.— The simulated EUV waves and the corresponding 3D ﬁeld conﬁguration at t = 6
min. The synthesized images are produced by tri-ratio method with reference image at t = 4
min. The tri-color channels are AIA 211 ˚A (red), AIA 193 ˚A (green), and AIA171 ˚A (blue).
The ratio in each channel is scaled to 1±0.3. The blue arrow marks the location of fast-mode
wave, and the red arrow marks the location where the ﬂux rope ﬁeld reconnects with AR2
ﬁeld. The red and green ﬁeld lines in the right panel represent ﬂux rope and surrounding
active region/open ﬁeld, respectively. The red isosurface represents density ratio of 1.05
between t = 6 min and t = 4 min solution. The blue isosurface represents a density ratio of
0.8.
