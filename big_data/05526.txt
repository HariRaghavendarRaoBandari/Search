DESTRUCTIBILITY OF THE TREE PROPERTY AT ℵω+1

YAIR HAYUT AND MENACHEM MAGIDOR

ABSTRACT. We construct a model in which the tree property holds in ℵω+1 and
it is destructible under Col(ω, ω1). On the other hand we discuss some cases in
which the tree property is indestructible under small or closed forcings.

1. INTRODUCTION

A partial order hT, ≤T i is called a tree, if it has a minimal element and for every
t ∈ T , the set {s ∈ T | s ≤T t} is well ordered by ≤T . The order type of the chain
of elements that lie below t in the tree order is called the level of t and denoted by
LevT (t). For a cardinal κ, T is called a κ-tree if supt∈T (LevT (t) + 1) = κ and the
cardinality of each level of T is strictly below κ.

By a theorem of K˝onig, every ω-tree has a coﬁnal branch (namely, a coﬁnal
chain). On the other hand, a theorem of Aronszajn states that there is an ω1-tree
that has no coﬁnal branches. Such a tree is called Aronszajn tree. For any larger
successor cardinal, κ > ω1, it is independent with ZFC whether there is κ-tree
with no coﬁnal branches. This question is related to other combinatorial topics and
in order to get the consistency of the non-existence of κ-Aronszajn tree, one must
assume the consistency of some large cardinals. If every κ tree has a coﬁnal branch,
we say that κ has the tree property.

By a theorem of Silver, if uncountable cardinal κ has the tree property then κ is
weakly compact cardinal in L. On the other end, Mitchell proved that if κ is weakly
compact cardinal and µ < κ is regular then there is a generic extension in which
κ = µ++ and the tree property holds at κ, thus showing that the tree property at
double successor of regular cardinal is equiconsistent with the existence of weakly
compact cardinal. Where κ is a successor of singular cardinal, the situation is more
complicated. In [3], Magidor and Shelah showed that it is consistent, relative to
some large cardinals, that the tree property holds at ℵω+1. The large cardinals
assumption was later reduced by Sinapova and Neeman to the existence of an ω-
sequence of supercompact cardinals (see, e.g. [4] for the Prikry-free version). In
both constructions, ℵ1 plays a special role. It reﬂects, in some sense, the properties
of ℵω+1.

In section 3 we will show that it is consistent to have a model in which the
tree property holds at ℵω+1, but after collapsing ℵ1, it fails. This extends a work
by Cummings, Foreman and the second author [2, Theorem 14].
In this paper
they show that it is possible that a weak square is added by a small forcing. Our
arguments are very similar to the arguments there.
In [5], Rinot shows that it
is consistent that there is no special Aronszajn tree on ℵω1+1 and a σ-closed ℵ2-
Knaster forcing of cardinality ℵ3 introduces one. We note that we do not know how
to apply a similar argument for this case.

In section 4 we discuss three cases in which the tree property at a successor
of a singular cardinal is somewhat indestructible.
In 4.1 we will show that it is
consistent that the tree property holds at ℵω2+1 and it is indestructible under any
forcing of cardinality < ℵω2. In 4.2 and 4.3 we will show that the tree property at

ℵω+1 can be made indestructible under small σ-closed forcings or arbitrary large
ℵω+1-closed forcings.

2. PRELIMINARIES

The following notation, due to Magidor and Shelah [3], plays an important role

in the investigation of the tree property at successors of singular cardinals.

Deﬁnition 1. Let λ be a regular cardinal. A system is a triplet S = hI, κ, Ri such
that:

(1) I ⊆ λ unbounded. κ < λ.
(2) R is a collection of partial order relations on I × κ.
(3) Each R ∈ R is a tree like partial order. R respects the lexicographic order
on I × κ. Namely, hα, ζiRhβ, ξi implies α ≤ β and if α = β then ζ = ξ.
Moreover, if hβ, ξi, hγ, ρiRhα, ζi and β ≤ γ then hβ, ξiRhγ, ρi.

(4) For every α < β in I there are ζ, ξ < κ and R ∈ R such that hα, ζiRhβ, ξi.
A branch through S is a set of elements on I × κ which is a chain relative to some
R ∈ R. We say that a branch b meets the α-th level of S if b ∩ {α} × κ 6= ∅. A branch
is coﬁnal if it meets coﬁnally many levels.

A system S is narrow if κ+, |R|+ < λ.

Deﬁnition 2. Let λ be a regular cardinal. We say that the narrow system property
holds at λ if every narrow system of height λ has a coﬁnal branch.

Unlike the tree property, the narrow system property is indestructible by any
˙S be a name for a
small forcing. Let P be a forcing notion with |P|+ < λ and let
˙R be the collection of names of relations in S and let I be the
narrow system. Let
set of all ordinals that can be levels of the P. Let us deﬁne the narrow system ˆS in
the natural way: the relations of ˆS are indexed by P× ˙R, and let hα, βi(p, R)hγ, δi iff
p (cid:13) hα, βiRhγ, δi for R ∈ ˙R. A branch in the system ˆS corresponds to a condition
p ∈ P and a set of element in S which are forced to be a branch in the generic
extension by p.

3. DESTRUCTIBLE TREE PROPERTY

Theorem 3. Let κ = κ0 < κ1 < · · · be an ω-sequence of supercompact cardinals.
Then there is a forcing extension in which the tree property holds at ℵω+1 and the
forcing Col(ω, ω1) adds a special Aronszajn tree.

We will prove something slightly stronger. We will deﬁne a forcing poset that
force that in the generic extension there is a partial weak square on ℵω+1 whose
domain contains all ordinals with coﬁnality above ω1, while the tree property holds
at ℵω+1. If we further extend the universe and collapse ω1 to be countable, then
we can complete all the missing ordinals in this square sequence by just adding
an ω sequences. By a theorem of Shelah and Ben-David [1], without violating the
continuum hypothesis at ℵω, we cannot hope to have this kind of partial square
with only one club at each ordinal. Our partial square will be quite wide.

Let µ = sup κn and let λ = µ+.
We begin with some deﬁnitions:

Deﬁnition 4. A partial square on a set S ⊆ λ with width < η is a sequence C =
hCα | α < λi such that:

(1) For every α < λ, Cα is a set of cardinality < η. If α ∈ S then Cα 6= ∅.
(2) Every D ∈ Cα is a closed and unbounded subset of α and otp D < α.
(3) If β ∈ acc D, D ∈ Cα then D ∩ β ∈ Cβ.

DESTRUCTIBILITY OF THE TREE PROPERTY AT ℵω+1

3

When λ = µ+, we may assume that otp D ≤ µ for every D ∈ Cα.
Since successor ordinals are never accumulation points of a club, the values
of the square sequence at successor points are irrelevant. We will assume that
Cα+1 = {α} for every α, for consistency.

We want to force a partial square for the set Sλ

≥κ with width < µ.

Deﬁnition 5. Let S be the following forcing notion. A condition s ∈ S is a sequence
s = hci | i ≤ γi for some ordinal γ < λ such that all three requirements for the
partial square sequence hold for every α ≤ γ. Namely,

(1) ∀α ≤ γ, cα is a set of less than µ sets. If cf α ≥ κ, then cα 6= ∅.
(2) For every D ∈ cα, otp D ≤ µ and D is a closed and unbounded subset of α.
(3) If β ∈ acc D, D ∈ cα then D ∩ β ∈ cβ.

We order S by end extension.

We will think on the conditions s ∈ S as functions, so for s = hci | i ≤ γi we will

write dom s = γ + 1 and s(i) = ci for i ∈ dom s.

Lemma 6. S is κ-directed closed.

Given a partial square C, we will deﬁne a threading forcing, Tη. This forcing will

add a club at λ with order type η such that all its initial segments are from C.

Deﬁnition 7. Let Tη = {D | ∃α, D ∈ Cα, 1 < otp D < η}, ordered by end exten-
sion.

The following lemma is standard:

Lemma 8. Let S, Tη be as above. Then:

(1) S is λ-distributive.
(2) Let C be the generic partial square added by S, and let η be a regular cardinal.
S ∗ Tη is equivalent to an η-closed forcing. Moreover, for every ρ < µ, S ∗ Tρ
η
(where we use full support power in V S) contains an η-closed dense subset.

Proof. Let us show that S is λ-distributive. We will show that it is η-strategically
closed for every regular η < λ. We will do this by showing the second part of the
lemma – that S ∗ Tη contains a η-closed dense set.

Let us observe ﬁrst that the set of conditions hs, ˇti ∈ S ∗ Tη, dom(s) = γ + 1,
t ∈ s(γ) is dense. For every condition hs, ˙ti, s (cid:13) " ˙t is a member of some set in the
square sequence" and therefore ˙t is forced to be a member of the ground model.

Thus, there is an extension of s, s′, which decides the value of ˙t to be equal to an
element in V , that we will denote by t. t might have no extension in s′(max dom s′)
but we can extend s′ to s′′ where dom s′′ = dom s′ + ω + 1, and t has an extension
in the top element of s′′. Let call this extension t′. Thus we have a condition
hs′′, t′i ≤ hs, ti and hs′′, t′i has the desired form.

The set D = {hs, ˇti ∈ S ∗ Tη | max t = max dom s} is η-closed. Let ρ < η and let
{hsi, ˇtii | i < ρ} ⊂ D be a decreasing sequence, and assume that sup dom si is limit
ordinal (otherwise, the sequence is ﬁxed from some point). The condition s⋆, t⋆i,
where t⋆ = S ti and s⋆ = (S si)aht⋆i is a condition in D, stronger than si for all i.
η contains a η-closed dense subset (for all
(cid:3)

The stronger statement, that S ∗ Tρ
ρ < µ), is proved by the same method.

Let us move now toward the proof of 3. Let κ0 < κ1 < · · · < κn < · · · be
supercompact cardinals. By using Laver’s preparation, we may assume that they
are Laver-indestructible, i.e. that for every n < ω and every κn-directed closed
forcing P, (cid:13)P ˇκn is supercompact. Let M = Qi<ω Col(κi, < κi+1) a full support
product of Levy collapses.

4

Lemma 9. After forcing with S × M, the narrow system property holds at λ.

Proof. Let HS ⊆ S, HM ⊆ M be generic ﬁlters. Let G = HS × HM . Let Hi ⊆
Col(κi, < κi+1) be the i-th coordinate of the generic ﬁlter HM . Let H i be the generic
ﬁlters for all the parts of M except the i-th coordinate, namely H i = hHm | m 6= ii.
Let S ∈ V [G] be a narrow system on I × η, with relations R. Let us assume,
towards a contradiction, that S has no coﬁnal branch in V [G]. Since the set I will
play no role later in the proof, we will restrict ourselves to the notation-wise simpler
case in which I = λ. Let n be large enough such that κn−2 ≥ |η × R|+ in V S×M.

Let Wn = V [G][H n]. Let us force over Wn with Tκn−2

. Let K = hKi | i < κni
be the sequence of pairwise mutually generic ﬁlters. We stress that the product,
Tκn−1

, is taken over V [G] and not over Wn.

κn

κn

Fix ξ < κn. Wn[Kξ] |= κn is supercompact since:
(1) S ∗ Tκn−2
(2) Qn≤i<ω Col(κi, < κi+1) is κn-directed closed.
(3) Qi<n−1 Col(κi, < κi+1) has cardinality < κn.

is κn-directed closed,

κn

Where we are using the indestructibility in the two ﬁrst forcings and Levy-Solovay
in the last one.

Let j : Wn[Kξ] → M be a λ-supercompact embedding with critical point κn.

Since Col(κn−1, < κn) is κn-c.c., after forcing with

Col(κn−1, j(κn)) = Col(κn−1, κn) × Col(κn−1, [κn, j(κn)))

we may extend the elementary embedding j to a λ-supercompact elementary em-
bedding ˜j : Wn[Hn][Kξ] → M [˜j(Hn)]. Since Wn[Hn] = V [G][H], S ∈ Wn[Hn], so
˜j(S) is deﬁned.

Let L = hLi | i < κn−2i be a generic ﬁlter for Col(κn−1, [κn, j(κn)))κn−2. Note

that the forcing that adds L is κn−1-closed over the V .

Let δ = sup ˜j′′λ < ˜j(λ). Let ≤i∈ R and let

bi,ǫ = {hα, βi | ˜j(S) |= hj(α), βi ≤i hδ, ǫi}.

Since |R|, η < κn = crit ˜j, for some i, ǫ, bi,ǫ is a coﬁnal branch and moreover
Si∈I,ǫ<η{α | ∃β, hα, βi ∈ bi,ǫ} = λ.

We say that forcing with Col(κn−1, [κn, j(κn))) × Tκn adds a system of branches

for S.

In particular the forcing Col(κn−1, [κn, < j(κn)))κn−2 × Tκn−2 introduces κn−2
many distinct realizations for the system of branches { ˙bi | i ∈ I}. Note that in order
to claim that there is no pair of system of branches which are equal we only used
the pairwise mutually genericity.

i , bβ

We conclude that in V [G][H][K][L] there are κn−2 different system of branches.
But in this model κn−2 ≥ |η×I|+ is still regular and cf λ ≥ κn−1. Since for every two
realization, and every relation ≤i∈ R, bα
i split at some point below λ, and since
there are only κn−2 realizations and only |R| relations in R, there is ρ⋆ < λ such
that for every ξ ≥ ρ⋆, and for every α, β, bα
i (ξ) 6= bβ(ξ) (where it is possible that
only one of them is deﬁned). By the Pigeonhole Principle there are α, β < κn−2
such that hρ⋆, ξi ∈ bα
i for the same ξ, i, because there are only |R| × η many
possibilities for this pair. This is a contradiction to the choice of ρ⋆. We conclude
that it is impossible that there was not coﬁnal branch in S in the ground model, as
wanted.
(cid:3)

i , bβ

Let W = V S×M.

Theorem 10. There is ρ < κ such that forcing with Col(ω, ρ+ω) × Col(ρ+ω+1, < κ)
over W forces the tree property at ℵω+1. Further collapsing the new ℵ1 introduces a
weak square at ℵω+1.

DESTRUCTIBILITY OF THE TREE PROPERTY AT ℵω+1

Proof. Assume otherwise. Let Lρ = Col(ω, ρ+ω)×Col(ρ+ω+1, < κ). For every ρ < κ,
let ˙Tρ, be a Lρ-name for an Aronszajn tree at λ. Since κ is supercompact, there is
j : W → M such that λM ⊆ M . By our assumption, M |= j(L)κ (cid:13) j( ˙T )κ is an
Aronszajn tree. Let δ = sup j′′λ < j(λ), and let t = hδ, 0i.

Work in M . For every α < λ, pick a condition pα = hcα, qαi such that

∃ζ < j(κ+ω), pα (cid:13)j(Lκ) hj(α), ζi ≤j( ˙T )κ

ˇt

Let us denote this ζ by ζα. We may pick the conditions pα in a way that qα is a
decreasing sequence. Since λ is regular and | Col(ω, κ+ω)| = κ+ω < λ, there is a
coﬁnal set I ⊆ λ, n < ω and c⋆ ∈ Col(ω, κ+ω) such that for every α ∈ I, cα = c⋆
and ζα < j(κ+n).

By elementariness, for every α, β ∈ I, there are γ, γ′ < κ+n, ρ < κ and p ∈ Lρ

such that p (cid:13)Lρ hα, γi ≤ ˙Tρ

hβ, γ′i.

This deﬁnes a narrow system in W : The domain of the system is I × κ+n. The

indices set is Sρ<κ Lρ × {ρ}. hα, ξi ≤p,ρ hβ, ζi iff p (cid:13)Lρ hα, ξi ≤ ˙Tρ

hβ, ζi.

By the narrow system property there is a coﬁnal branch in W . Namely there are

ρ < κ, p ∈ Lρ and γ < κ+n such that for every α, β ∈ I, p (cid:13)Lρ hα, γi ≤ hβ, γi.

This prove that the tree property holds at ℵω+1 in the generic extension.
For the last claim, note that after collapsing ℵ1, for every γ < ℵω+1 either cf γ =
ω or Cγ 6= ∅. Thus, one can complete the partial square to a full (cid:3)ℵω ,<ℵω by adding
coﬁnal ω-sequences.
(cid:3)

4. INDESTRUCTIBLE TREE PROPERTY

In this section we will build three models in which the tree property at a suc-
cessor of singular cardinal is indestructible under certain class of forcing notions.
We start by building a model in which the tree property holds at ℵω2+1 and it is
indestructible under any forcing P of cardinality less than ℵω2 . Similarly, we will
construct a model for the tree property at ℵω+1 in which the tree property still holds
after any σ-closed forcing of cardinality < ℵω.

In the last subsection we will show that it is possible to force the tree property

at ℵω+1 to be indestructible under any ℵω+1-closed forcing notions.

4.1. Indestructible Tree Property for ℵω2+1. In this subsection, we will show that
in Sinapova’s model for the tree property at ℵω2+1 [6], the tree property is inde-
structible under small forcings. We start with some simple observations:

Lemma 11. Let λ be a cardinal such that the tree property holds at λ+ and it is
indestructible by any forcing of the form Col(ω, µ) for µ < λ. Then the tree property
at λ+ is indestructible by any forcing of size < λ. Moreover, it is enough to assume
that for every µ < λ there is µ ≤ µ′ < λ such that Col(ω, µ′) forces the tree property
at λ+.

Proof. Let P be a forcing notion of cardinality < λ. Let µ = |P|. Col(ω, µ) adds a
generic ﬁlter for P. Let G ⊆ P be a generic ﬁlter. The quotient forcing Col(ω, µ)/G
has cardinality at most µ and therefore it does not add a coﬁnal branch to any λ+-
Aronszajn tree. Since the tree property holds after forcing with Col(ω, µ) and the
forcing Col(ω, µ)/G does not add a branch to Aronszajn tree – the tree property
holds in V [G] as well.
(cid:3)

Theorem 12. Le tκ = κ0 < κ1 < · · · be a sequence of ω supercompact cardinals. Let
µ = sup κn and λ = µ+. There is a generic extension in which κ = ℵω2, λ = ℵω2+1
and for every ρ < µ, the tree property holds after forcing with Col(ω, ρ).

6

YAIR HAYUT AND MENACHEM MAGIDOR

In order to prove this theorem, we will work with Sinapova’s model for the tree
property at ℵω2+1 from [6]. We will not need to violate SCH at this point, so the
proof is somewhat simpler at some points.

The main idea behind the indestructibility is that one can deﬁne a projection
f : P → P that shifts the Prikry sequence by one step to the left. This way, we
can analyze the sets that were added by a forcing of the form Col(ω, µ) simply by
shifting the ﬁrst element of the Prikry sequence to be above µ. We will show that
the quotient forcing between the model P ∗ Col(ω, µ) and the model P is λ-centred
and therefore cannot add a branch to a λ+-Aronszajn tree.

We start with a well known fact:

Lemma 13. Let M = Qn<ω Col(κn, < κn+1) - a full support product of Levy collapses.
In V M the narrow branch property holds at λ+.

The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 9.
Work in V M. κ0 = κ is still supercompact, by the Laver indestructibility, so we
may pick a normal measure on Pκλ, U . Let Un be the projection of U to Pκκn for
n < ω.

Let jn : W → Nn ∼= Ult(W, Un) be the elementary embedding derived from Un.
Let us construct a Nn-generic ﬁlter Hn for the forcing Col(κ+ω+2, < j(κ))Nn . This
is possible by the standard arguments: the forcing notion Col(κ+ω+2, < j(κ))Nn is
κn+1-closed in W and has only κ+n+1-dense subsets in Nn.

Let’s deﬁne the forcing P:
A condition p ∈ P has the following form

p = hd0, a0, c0, . . . , an−1, cn−1, An, Cn, . . . i

where:

(1) ai ∈ Pκκ+i and Ai ∈ Ui. Let ρi = ai ∩ κ if i < n and ρi = κ otherwise.
(2) d0 ∈ Col(ω, ρ+ω
(3) ci ∈ Col(ρ+ω+2
(4) Ci : Ai → W such that Ci(a) ∈ Col((a ∩ κ)+ω+2, < κ) for every a ∈ Ai and

0 ) if ρ0 < κ and otherwise d0 ∈ Col(ω, κ).

Theorem 14 (Sinapova). P forces that λ = ℵω2+1 and the tree property holds in λ.

˙T
Proof. We will give a sketch of the proof. Let p ∈ P be a condition and let
be a name for a λ-Aronszajn tree. Let n be the length of p. Let j : V → M be
a λ-supercompact embedding, with critical point κ which is compatible with Un
(namely Un is the Pκκ+n measure which is derived from j).

In M , let us look at the forcing j(P) below the condition pahj′′κ+ni (the maximal
extension of p that forces that the n + 1-th element of the diagonal Prikry sequence
is j′′κ+n). This forcing preserves λ as a regular cardinal and realizes j( ˙T ) to be a
j(λ)-Aronszajn tree.

Let us denote δ = sup j′′λ < j(λ) and let us look at the name of a partial branch

{hj(α), ζαi | M j(P) |= hj(α), ζαi ≤j( ˙T ) hδ, 0i}.

DESTRUCTIBILITY OF THE TREE PROPERTY AT ℵω+1

7

Using the Prikry property, we may ﬁnd a direct extension of j(p), q, such that
for every α < λ the value of n < ω such that ζα < j(κ+n) is determined by q up
to forcing with the ﬁrst m lower parts of P (m < ω). Since there are less than λ
many possible values for the ﬁrst m coordinates of the conditions below q, there is
a coﬁnal subset of λ, I, a natural number n⋆ < ω large enough and a ﬁxed lower
part a⋆ of length n⋆ such that

I = {α < λ | ∃r ≤ j(p), stem(r) = a⋆, r (cid:13) ∃ζ < j(κ+n⋆ ), hα, ζi ≤ hδ, 0i}.

In particular, for every α, β ∈ I, M thinks that there is a direct extension of j(p),
q and ordinals ζ, ζ′ < j(κ+n⋆ ) such that q (cid:13) hj(α), ζi ≤j( ˙T ) hj(β), ζ′i. Reﬂecting
this to V we conclude that for every α, β ∈ I there is a condition q ≤ p with stem
of length n and ζ, ζ′ < κ+n⋆ such that q (cid:13) hα, ζi ≤ ˙T hβ, ζ′i.

This deﬁnes a narrow system on I × κ+n⋆, indexed by the stems of length n
which are stronger than the stem of p. By the narrow system property, there is a
coﬁnal branch. So there is I ′ ⊆ I, a stem s⋆ and an ordinal ζ⋆ < κ+n⋆ such that for
every α < β in I ′ there is a condition q with stem s⋆ forcing hα, ζ⋆i ≤ ˙T hβ, ζ⋆i.

Next we will build inductively a sequence of conditions hpα | α ∈ I ′ \ ρi (for

some ρ < λ), such that for every α < β,

pα ∧ pβ (cid:13) hα, ζ⋆i ≤ ˙T hβ, ζ⋆i

The construction is done by induction on m < ω, where at each step we deﬁne
pα ↾ m in a way that for all α, β (except a bounded segment) there is a condition q
with q ↾ m = pα ↾ m ∧ pβ ↾ m such that

q (cid:13) hα, ζ⋆i ≤ ˙T hβ, ζ⋆i.

Extending pα ↾ m to pα ↾ (m+1) is done by deﬁning a narrow system corresponding
to the possible extension and using the branch in order to deﬁne the relevant value
for all α ∈ I ′ above the ﬁrst level that the branch meets.

Eventually, we obtain a sequence of conditions {pα | α ∈ I ′ \ ρ}, for some ρ < λ,
pα ≤ p. Using the chain condition of the forcing P we conclude that there is an
extension of p that forces that for unbounded many ordinals α < λ, pα will be in
the generic ﬁlter. But then {hα, ζ⋆i | pα ∈ G} is a coﬁnal branch in ˙T (where G is
the generic ﬁlter for P).
(cid:3)

We will introduce a shifted version of the above forcing. For s < ω, we deﬁne the
forcing Ps.

A condition p ∈ Ps has the following form

p = hd0, a0, c0, . . . , an−1, cn−1, An, Cn, . . . i

where:

(1) ai ∈ Pκκ+i+s and Ai ∈ Ui+s. Let ρi = ai ∩ κ if i < n and ρi = κ otherwise.
(2) d0 ∈ Col(ω, ρ+ω
(3) ci ∈ Col(ρ+ω+2
(4) Ci : Pκκ+i+s → W such that Ci(a) ∈ Col((a∩κ)+ω+2, < κ) for every a ∈ Ai

0 ) if ρ0 < κ and otherwise d0 ∈ Col(ω, κ).

, ρi+1)

i

and [Ci]Ui+s ∈ Hi+s.

We order the conditions in the same way as we did for P.

The proof of Theorem 14 still works without change and we conclude that:

Theorem 15. For every s < ω, Ps forces λ = ℵω2+1 and the tree property holds at λ

In order to show the indestructibility, we need to show that there is a simple

connection between the different shifts of the forcing:

Lemma 16. Let p ∈ P, len(p) = n + 1, n ≥ 1. There is a condition q, of length one
such that ρq

n, and a projection π : Pn/q → P × Col(ω, ρ+ω

n ).

0 = ρp

Proof. Let η = ρp
n.

First, let us note that P/p is the product of C = Col(ω, ρω

, <
ρi+1) and the forcing P≥n which is the set of n-upper part of the conditions of P.

Since |C| = ρn ≤ ρω

n = η, the forcing Col(ω, η) projects onto C × Col(ω, η). Let

π0 be the projection.

d0 ∈ Col(ω, η). Let π(r) be

Let r = hd0, a0, c0 . . . i ∈ Pn, r ≤ q. So d0 ∈ Col(ω, (ρq

π0(r)aha0, c0, a1, c1, . . . i ∈ P × Col(ω, η)

Clearly, π is a projection.

Lemma 17. Let G be a generic ﬁlter for P×Col(ω, η) above p. The separative quotient
of the quotient forcing {r ∈ Pn/q | π(r) ∈ G} is equivalent to a forcing of cardinality
η.

Proof. The lemma follows from the representation of P ↾ p and Ps ↾ q as a product.
(cid:3)

Theorem 18. P forces the tree property at ℵω2+1 to be indestructible by any forcing
of size < ℵω2.

Proof. Is it enough to show that it is the case for Col(ω, ℵω·n). Recall that ℵω·n =
ρ+ω
so we are in the situation of Lemma 17. This means that after forcing with
n
Col(ω, ℵω·n) there is a further forcing R that restores the tree property (as the
iteration is equivalent to forcing with Pn above some condition). But |R| = ℵω·n is
a small forcing so it can’t add a branch to an Aronszajn tree. So every ℵω2+1-tree
in the universe after forcing with Col(ω, ℵωn) must have a branch.
(cid:3)

4.2. Indestructible Tree property for ℵω+1 under small σ-closed forcings. Let
us construct a model very similar to subsection 4.1, in which we have the tree prop-
erty at ℵω+1 and it will be indestructible under any σ-closed forcing of cardinality
< ℵω. The additional restriction on the forcing notions (namely that we require the
forcing to be σ-closed), implies that those forcing notions cannot collapse ω1.

Theorem 19. It is consistent, relative to the existence of ω many supercompact cardi-
nals, that the tree property holds at ℵω+1 and it is indestructible under any σ-closed
forcing of cardinality < ℵω.

Proof. We will start with a model of the narrow system property at κ+ω+1 for κ
a supercompact cardinal. This can be obtained, for example, by forcing with the
product of the Levy collapses between the supercompact cardinals as in Lemma 13.
Let U0 be a normal ultraﬁlter on κ generated from a κ+ω+1-supercompact elemen-
tary embedding, j : V → M .

Let us show that for every n < ω, there is a large set An ∈ U0 such that for every
ρ ∈ An, forcing with Lρ = Col(ω, ρ+ω) × Col(ρ+ω+1, κ+n) forces the tree property
at κ+ω+1.

Assume that this is not the case and let ˙Tρ be a counterexample for every "bad
choice" of ρ, for a ﬁxed n < ω. Since the set of bad choices is in U0, κ is a bad choice
of ordinal in M . Let us force with j(L)κ, and let M [H] be the generic extension.
Let T = j( ˙T )H
κ be an Aronszajn tree at j(κω+1). Let δ = sup j′′κ+ω+1 and for every
α < κ+ω+1 let βα < j(κ+ω) be the element in the level j(α) below hδ, 0i.

Using the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 10, there is a coﬁnal
set I ⊆ κ+ω+1, a decreasing sequence of conditions qα ∈ Col(κ+ω+1, j(κ)+n), a

DESTRUCTIBILITY OF THE TREE PROPERTY AT ℵω+1

condition p ∈ Col(ω, κ+ω) and a natural number N < ω such that for every α ∈ I
there is β < j(κ+N ) such that (p, qα) (cid:13) hj(α), βi ≤T hδ, 0i.

Reﬂecting this back to V , we conclude that for every α, α′ ∈ I:

∃β, β′ < κ+N , ρ < κ, p ∈ Lρ such that p (cid:13)Lρ hα, βi ≤Tρ hα′, β′i.

This gives us a narrow system, similar to the one in the proof of Theorem 10.
A branch through this system provides us an ordinal ρ which was a bad choice, a
condition r ∈ Lρ, a coﬁnal set J ⊆ I and for all α ∈ J an ordinal βα < κ+N such
that for all α, α′ ∈ J ,

r (cid:13)Lρ hα, βαi, hα′, βα′i are compatible.

This is a contradiction to the fact that this ˙Tρ was a name for an λ-Aronszajn tree.
Let A = Sn<ω An and let ρ ∈ A. Forcing with Col(ω, ρ+ω) × Col(ρ+ω+1, κ)
forces the tree property. For every small σ-closed forcing notion Q there is n such
that Col(ρ+ω+1, κ) ∗ Q is a regular subforcing of Col(ρ+ω+1, κ+n) and since the tree
property holds after this forcing and since the quotient is small and thus cannot
add branches to Aronszajn trees - we are done.
(cid:3)

4.3. Indestructible Tree Property at ℵω+1 under closed forcings.

Theorem 20. Assume that hκn | n < ωi is a sequence of supercompact cardinals.
There is a generic extension in which the tree property holds at ℵω+1 and it is inde-
structible under any ℵω+1-closed forcing.

Proof. Let λ = (supn<ω κn)+.

We would like to force with the iteration

Col(ω, ρ) ∗ Col(ρ+, < κ0) ∗ Col(κ0, < κ1) ∗ · · · ∗ Col(λ, µ)

and show that for every µ ≥ λ there is ρ < κ0 such that this iteration forces the
tree property at λ. Then, we claim that for many values of µ, the same ρ works and
conclude that in this case, the iteration

Col(ω, ρ) ∗ Col(ρ+, < κ0) ∗ Col(κ0, < κ1) ∗ · · · ∗ Col(κm, < κm+1) ∗ · · ·

force the tree property at ℵω+1 in an indestructible way.

We know that the claim holds when we use product instead of iteration. In this
case, the arguments of Neeman shows that for all µ ≥ λ there is ρ < κ0 such that
the forcing with ρ forces the tree property. Luckily, there is a natural projection
from the product onto the iteration. The termspace forcing for each component in
the iteration contains a dense subset in which every element is a partial function
from the domain of the collapse into names of ordinals below the the range of the
collapse. Using the chain condition of the components, the number of names of
ordinals is the same as the number of ordinals in each component.

So, in order to pull all of this together, we need to know that the quotient forcing

of the product modulo the iteration cannot add a branch to a λ-Aronszajn tree.

The following lemma will show that this is indeed the case:

Lemma 21. Let λn, n < ω be an increasing sequence of regular cardinals, µ = sup λn,
λ = µ+. Denote λ−1 = ω.

Let Pn be a P0 ∗ · · · Pn−1-name for a λn−1-forcing notion of cardinality ≤ λn. Pω is
a P0 ∗ · · · ∗ Pn ∗ · · · -name for a λ-closed forcing (the iteration is with full support). Let
Qn be a λn−1-forcing notion of cardinality ≤ λn, and Qω a λ-closed forcing notion.

Assume that for all n < ω, there is a projection πn : Qn → Pn in V P0∗···∗Pn−1 and

there is πω : Qω → Pω in the generic extension by P0 ∗ · · · Pn ∗ · · · .

Let Q = Qn≤ω Qn and let P = P0 ∗ · · · ∗ Pn ∗ · · · ∗ Pω, both with full support. Let

π : Q → P be the corresponding projection and let R be the quotient forcing.

YAIR HAYUT AND MENACHEM MAGIDOR

Assume that π is σ-continuous. Namely, that if pn ≤ π(qn) in P, pn, qn are decreas-

ing and there are limits pω ≤ V pn, qω ≤ V qn then pω ≤ π(qω).
Let T be a λ-tree in V P. Then R does not add a branch to T .

Proof. Assume otherwise, and let ˙b be a R-name for a new branch.

Let us deﬁne by induction conditions pn ∈ P, qη ∈ Q for all n < ω, η ∈

Sn<ω Qm<n λm and ordinals ζα < λ such that:

(1) pn (cid:13) qη ∈ R for all len η < n.
(2) n < m implies pm ≤ pn.
(3) For α < β < λn and η ∈ Qm<n λm,

hpn+1, qαi (cid:13) ˙b(ζβ) = ˙x, hpn+1, qβi (cid:13) ˙b(ζβ) = ˙y and pn+1 (cid:13) ˙x 6= ˙y.

(4) For all m ≥ n, pm ↾ n = pn ↾ n. For all η E η′, qη ≥ qη′ and qη ↾

(len(η) − 2) = qη′ ↾ (len(η) − 2).

The induction works since for every n < ω, one can construct a decreasing
sequence of conditions ˜pα ≤ pn, α < λn, with ﬁxed ﬁrst n coordinates such that for
every α, β < λn and η ∈ Qm<n λm one can ﬁnd for every possible extension of the
lower n-part of ˜pα, qηahαi, qηahβi a further extension in which qηahαi, qηahβi force
contradictory information on the branch. Using the closure of the forcing notions
and the limitation on their sizes, this can be done. We take pn+1 to be a lower
bound of ˜pα for all α < λn.

In the end of the process, we have a condition pω, ∀n < ω, pω ≤ pn (well deﬁned,

since all but maybe P0 are σ-closed and we ﬁx the ﬁrst coordinate).

Using the closure of the upper coordinates of Q, for all η ∈ Qn<ω λn, there is
qη ∈ Q which is stronger than qη↾n for all n < ω. Let us show that pω (cid:13) qη ∈ R.
This is true by our assumption that π is σ-continuous.

Finally, qη, η ∈ Qn<ω λn deﬁne a set of | Q λn| many incompatible evaluations
(cid:3)

for ˙b at bounded point of the tree - a contradiction.

Let us return to the proof of the theorem.
Let Pn be the n-th collapse in the iteration and Qn be the n-th collapse in the
product. It is well known that there are projections πn : Qn → Pn as required (de-
ﬁned by identifying the collapse forcing in the product with the termspace forcing
for the n-th step of the iteration). Therefore, it is enough to show that for all µ there
is ρ such that the product Col(ω, ρ)×Col(ρ+, < κ0)×Q Col(κm, < κm+1)×Col(λ, µ)
forces the tree property.

Lemma 22. Let µ ≥ λ. There is ρ < κ0 such that the forcing

M = Col(ω, ρ) × Col(ρ+, < κ) × Y

Col(κm, κm+1) × Col(λ, µ)

m

forces the tree property at λ.

Proof. For all n, κn is indestructible supercompact. Thus, we can start by forcing
with Col(λ, µ), and work in W = V Col(λ,µ) in which still for every n < ω, the
cardinal κn is indestructible supercompact. In W , we apply Neeman’s proof and
conclude that there is ρ < κ0 such that Col(ω, ρ)×Col(ρ+, < κ)×Qm Col(κm, κm+1)
forces the tree property at λ.
(cid:3)

Combining those two lemmas, for every µ ≥ λ there is ρ < κ0 such that forcing

with Lρ ∗ Col(λ, µ), where

Lρ = Col(ω, ρ) ∗ Col(ρ+, < κ0) ∗ Col(κ0, < κ1) ∗ · · ·

will force the tree property at λ. For class many values of µ, the same ρ works. Let
us call the elements of this class the good cardinals. Let ρ⋆ be this value and let us
force with Lρ⋆ .

DESTRUCTIBILITY OF THE TREE PROPERTY AT ℵω+1

11

Now, let P be a λ-closed forcing in V Lρ⋆ . There is µ large enough which is good
and such that there is a projection from Col(λ, µ) onto P. Since the tree property
holds at λ in V Lρ⋆ ∗Col(λ,µ) and the quotient forcing Col(λ,µ)/P cannot add a branch
to an Aronszajn tree - the tree property holds at λ in V Lρ⋆ ∗P as well.

5. OPEN QUESTIONS

In Section 4.1 we proved that the tree property at ℵω2+1 can be made indestruc-

tible under any small forcing poset.

Question 1. Is it consistent that the tree property at ℵω+1 is indestructible under
any forcing of cardinality < ℵω?

On the other hand, one can ask whether it is possible to extend the results of

Theorem 3.

Question 2. Is it consistent that the tree property holds at ℵω+1 but there is a
small forcing (of cardinality < ℵω), that does not collapse cardinals and adds an
Aronszajn tree?

Note that in all the currently known models for the tree property at ℵω+1, adding
a single Cohen real does not add Aronszajn tree at ℵω+1. So we ask the following
stronger version of Question 2:

Question 3. Is it consistent that the tree property holds at ℵω+1 but there adding
a Cohen real adds an Aronszajn tree?

This question is particularly interesting when we assume that ℵω is strong limit

since then adding a Cohen real cannot add a weak square for ℵω.
