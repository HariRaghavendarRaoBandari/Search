Abstract: We study the local symplectic algebra of curves with semigroups (4, 5, 6, 7), (4, 5, 6) and

(4, 5, 7). We use the method of algebraic restrictions to parameterized curves as in [D1]. A new dis-

crete invariant for algebraic restrictions to parameterized quasi-homogeneous curves is introduced. This

invariant together with the method of algebraic restriction can distinguish diﬀerent symplectic orbits of

quasi-homogeneous curves.

Introduction

This paper is concerned with the problem of symplectic classiﬁcation of parameterized
quasi-homogeneous curve-germs in the symplectic space (K2n, ω) (K = R or C).

We say that two parameterized curve-germs f, g : (K, 0) → (K2n, 0) are symplecti-
cally equivalent, or symplectomorphic, if there exist a germ of diﬀeomorphism φ :
(K, 0) → (K, 0) and a germ of symplectomorphism Φ : ((K2n, ω), 0)) → ((K2n, ω), 0) such
that Φ ◦ f = g ◦ φ. By symplectomorphism we mean a diﬀeomorphism which preserves the
symplectic form ω. We study the action of a subgroup of the classical A-group where the
diﬀeomorphism in the target is a symplectomorphism.

The problem of symplectic classiﬁcation of singular varieties was introduced by V.I.
Arnold in [A1]. He proved that the A2k-singularity of a planar curve (the orbit with respect
to the standard A-equivalence of parameterized curves) splits into exactly 2k + 1 symplectic
singularities. He distinguish the orbits by the orders of tangency of the parameterized curve
to the nearest smooth Lagrangian submanifold. Arnold posed a problem of expressing these
new symplectic invariants in terms of the local algebra’s interaction with the symplectic
structure and he proposed to call this interaction the local symplectic algebra.

In [IJ] G. Ishikawa and S. Janeczko classiﬁed symplectic singularities of curves in the
2-dimensional symplectic space. A symplectic form on a 2-dimensional manifold is a special
case of a volume form on a smooth manifold. The generalization of results in [IJ] to volume-
preserving classiﬁcation of singular varieties and maps in arbitrary dimensions was obtained
in [DR].

A symplectic singularity is stably simple if it is simple and remains simple if the ambient
symplectic space is symplectically embedded (i.e. as a symplectic submanifold) into a
larger symplectic space.
In [K] P. A. Kolgushkin classiﬁed the stably simple symplectic
singularities of curves (in the C-analytic category).

A generalization of the Darboux-Givental Theorem ([AG]) to germs of quasi-homogeneous
subsets of the symplectic space was obtained in [DJZ2] and reduces the problem of symplec-
tic classiﬁcation of germs of quasi-homogeneous subsets to the problem of classiﬁcation of
algebraic restrictions of symplectic forms to these subsets. By this method, complete sym-
plectic classiﬁcations of the A − D − E singularities of planar curves and the S5 singularity
were obtained in [DJZ2].

In [D1] W. Domitrz used the method of algebraic restrictions to study the problem of
symplectic classiﬁcation of quasi-homogeneous parametrized curve-germs. He proved that
the vector space of algebraic restrictions of closed 2-forms to the germ of a K-analytic
curve is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space. The symplectic orbits were distinguished by
the symplectic invariants: symplectic multiplicity, index of isotropy and the Lagrangian
tangency order.

The method of algebraic restrictions was also applied to the zero-dimensional symplectic
isolated complete intersection singularities (see [D2]) and to other 1-dimensional isolated
complete intersection singularities: the Sµ symplectic singularities for µ > 5 in [DT1], the
T7 − T8 symplectic singularities in [DT2], the W8 − W9 symplectic singularities in [T1] and
the U7, U8 and U9 symplectic singularities in [T2].

In this paper we use the method of algebraic restrictions described in [D1] to obtain the
symplectic classiﬁcation of all parametrized curve-germs with semigroups (4, 5, 6, 7), (4, 5, 6)
and (4, 5, 7). The choice of the semigroup (4, 5, 6, 7) is due to the following reason: this
semigroup shows us that the system of symplectic invariants used in [D1] is not enough to
distinguish all the symplectic orbits here obtained. Then we apply this method to others
semigroups as examples.

The contribution of this paper is to introduce a new discrete invariant for algebraic
restrictions of k-forms to parameterized quasi-homogeneous curves: the proportional
minimum quasi-degree part. This is a very natural invariant for algebraic restrictions
but the translation of this invariant for the symplectic action is still open.

We present an algorithm in Singular software [DGPS] to ﬁnd a basis of the space of

algebraic restrictions of closed 2-forms to a germ of parameterized curve.

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we recall the method of algebraic re-
strictions for quasi-homogeneous curves following [D1]. The discrete symplectic invariants
appear in section 3. Finally, in section 4, we present the classiﬁcation.

2 The method of algebraic restrictions of quasi-homogeneous

curves

In this section we present the method of algebraic restrictions. More details can be found
in [DJZ2] and [D1].

Deﬁnition 2.1. A curve-germ f : (K, 0) → (Km, 0) is quasi-homogeneous if there exist
coordinate systems t on (K, 0) and (x1, . . . , xm) on (Km, 0) and positive integers (λ1, . . . , λm)
such that

d

dt(cid:19) = E ◦ f,

df(cid:18)t

2

where E =Pm

i=1 λixi∂/∂xi is the germ of the Euler vector ﬁeld on (Km, 0). The coordinate
system (x1, . . . , xm) is also called quasi-homogeneous, and the numbers (λ1, . . . , λm) are
called weights.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Positive integers λ1, . . . , λm are linearly dependent over non-negative

integers if there exist j and non-negative integers ki for i 6= j such that λj = Pi6=j kiλi.

Otherwise we say that λ1, . . . , λm are linearly independent over non-negative inte-
gers.

It is not diﬃcult to show that quasi-homogeneous curves have the following form in

quasi-homogeneous coordinates.

Proposition 2.3. A curve-germ f is quasi-homogeneous if and only if it is A-equivalent to

t → (tλ1, . . . , tλk , 0, . . . , 0),

where λ1 < · · · < λk are positive integers linearly independent over non-negative integers.

The integers λ1, . . . , λk generate the semigroup of the curve f , which we denote by

(λ1, . . . , λk).

Deﬁnition 2.4. The germ of a function, of a diﬀerential k-form, or a vector ﬁeld α on
(Km, 0) is quasi-homogeneous in a coordinate system (x1, . . . , xm) on (Km, 0) with posi-
i=1 λixi∂/∂xi is the germ of the Euler

tive weights (λ1, . . . , λm) if LEα = δα, where E =Pm

vector ﬁeld on (Km, 0) and δ is a real number called the quasi-degree.

It is easy to show that α is quasi-homogeneous in a coordinate system (x1, . . . , xm) with
weights (λ1, . . . , λm) if and only if F ∗
t α = tδα, where Ft(x1, . . . , xm) = (tλ1x1, . . . , tλmxm).
Thus germs of quasi-homogeneous functions of quasi-degree δ are germs of weighted homoge-
neous polynomials of degree δ. The coeﬃcient fi1,...,ik of the quasi-homogeneous diﬀerential

k-formP fi1,...,ik dxi1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxik of quasi-degree δ is a weighted homogeneous polynomial of
degree δ −Pk

j=1 λij . The coeﬃcient fi of the quasi-homogeneous vector ﬁeld Pm

of quasi-degree δ is a weighted homogeneous polynomial of degree δ + λi.

i=1 fi∂/∂xi

Proposition 2.5. ([DJZ2]) If X is the germ of a quasi-homogeneous vector ﬁeld of quasi-
degree i on (Km, 0) and ω is the germ of a quasi-homogeneous diﬀerential k-form of quasi-
degree j on (Km, 0) then LXω is the germ of a quasi-homogeneous diﬀerential k-form of
quasi-degree i + j on (Km, 0).

Given the germ of a smooth manifold (M, p) denote by Λk(M ) the space of all germs
at p of diﬀerential k-forms on M . Given a curve-germ f : (K, 0) → (M, p) we introduce the
following subspaces of Λk(M ):

Λk
Im(f )(M ) = {ω ∈ Λk(M ) : ω(f (t)) = 0 for any t ∈ (K, 0)},
0 (Im(f ), M ) = {α + dβ : α ∈ Λk
Im(f )(M )}.

Im(f )(M ), β ∈ Λk−1

A k

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let f : (K, 0) → (M, p) be a curve-germ and ω ∈ Λk(M ). The algebraic
restriction of ω to Im(f ) is the equivalence class of ω in Λk(M ), where the equivalence
is as follows: ω is equivalent to ˜ω if ω − ˜ω ∈ A k
0 (Im(f ), M ). We denote the algebraic
restriction of ω to Im(f ) as [ω]f .

The next result provides some basic properties about the set of zero algebraic restrictions

to a parameterized curve-germ.

In particular, the exterior derivative and the wedge product for algebraic restriction to

a parametrized curve-germ are well deﬁned.

Let (M, p) and (fM , ˜p) be germs of smooth equi-dimensional manifolds. Let f : (K, 0) →

germs of diﬀeomorphisms Φ : (fM , ˜p) → (M, p) and φ : (K, 0) → (K, 0) such that Φ◦ ˜f ◦φ−1 =

Deﬁnition 2.8. Two algebraic restrictions [ω]f and [˜ω] ˜f are diﬀeomorphic if there exist

f and Φ∗([ω]f ) := [Φ∗ω]Φ−1◦f = [˜ω] ˜f ◦φ−1 = [˜ω] ˜f .

Remark 2.9. The above deﬁnition does not depend of the choice of the representatives ω
and ˜ω since a local diﬀeomorphism maps forms with zero algebraic restriction to f to forms
with zero algebraic restrictions to ˜f .

The method of algebraic restrictions is based on the following result.

Theorem 2.10. (Theorem A in [DJZ2]) Let f : (K, 0) → (K2n, 0) be the germ of a quasi-
If ω0, ω1 are germs of symplectic forms on (K2n, 0) with the same
homogeneous curve.
algebraic restriction to f then there exists a germ of a diﬀeomorphism Φ : (K2n, 0) →
(K2n, 0) such that Φ ◦ f = f and Φ∗ω1 = ω0.

Corollary 2.11. The quasi-homogeneous curve-germs f1 and f2 are symplectomorphic in
the symplectic space (K2n, ω) if and only if the algebraic restrictions [ω]f1 and [ω]f2 are
diﬀeomorphic.

Theorem 2.10 reduces the symplectic classiﬁcation of curve-germs which are diﬀeomor-
phic to some ﬁxed quasi-homogeneous curve-germ to the classiﬁcation of algebraic restric-
tions with symplectic representative to this ﬁxed curve-germ.

Let f be a parameterized curve-germ. Every algebraic restriction to f of a closed 2-form

has a symplectic representative due to the following result.

Proposition 2.12. ([DJZ2]) Let r be the minimal dimension of germs of smooth subman-
ifolds of (K2n, 0) containing Im(f ). Let (S, 0) be one of such germs of dimension r. Let θ
be the germ of a closed 2-form on (K2n, 0). Then there exists a germ of a symplectic form
ω on (K2n, 0) such that [θ]f = [ω]f if and only if rank(θ|T0S) ≥ 2r − 2n.

The following result shows the reason that this method is very powerful for analytic

curves.

Theorem 2.13. ([D1]) Let C be the germ of a K-analytic curve. Then the space of algebraic
restrictions to C of germs of closed 2-forms is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space.

Theorem 2.14. ([D1]) The space of algebraic restrictions of closed 2-forms to a param-
eterized quasi-homogeneous curve-germ g is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space spanned by
algebraic restrictions of quasi-homogeneous closed 2-forms of bounded quasi-degrees.

Let f : (K, 0) → (K2n, 0) be a parametrized curve-germ and let (M, 0) be a germ of
submanifold in (K2n, 0) such that Im(f ) ⊂ (M, 0). Due to the following result we can
replace the classiﬁcation of algebraic restrictions to f in (K2n, 0) to the classiﬁcation of
algebraic restrictions to f in (M, 0).

Proposition 2.15. ([DJZ2])

(a) Let (M, 0) be the germ of a smooth submanifold of (Km, 0) containing Im(f ). Let
ω1, ω2 be germs of k-forms on (Km, 0). Then [ω1]f = [ω2]f if and only if [ω1|T M ]f =
[ω2|T M ]f .

(b) Let f1, f2 be curve-germs in (Km, 0) whose images are contained in germs of equi-
dimensional smooth submanifolds (M1, 0), (M2, 0) respectively. Let ω1, ω2 be two germs
of k-forms on (Km, 0). The algebraic restrictions [ω1]f1 and [ω2]f2 are diﬀeomorphic
if and only if the algebraic restrictions [ω1|T M1]f1 and [ω2|T M2]f2 are diﬀeomorphic.

The following two results are very useful to obtain a basis of the space of algebraic

restrictions of closed 2-forms to f .

Proposition 2.16. ([DJZ2]) Let a1, . . . , ak be a basis of the space of algebraic restrictions
of 2-forms to a quasi-homogeneous parameterized curve-germ f : (K, 0) → (Km, 0) satisfying
the following conditions:

(1) da1 = · · · = daj = 0,

(2) the algebraic restrictions daj+1, . . . , dak are linearly independent.

Then a1, . . . , aj is a basis of the space of algebraic restrictions of closed 2-forms to f .

Fix a coordinate system (x1, . . . , xm) in (Km, 0).

Lemma 2.17. ([D1]) Let f be a quasi-homogeneous curve on (Km, 0). If the monomials
l have the same quasi-degree then the forms s(x)dxi∧dxj

l=1 xpl

and p(x)dxi ∧ dxj have the same algebraic restriction to f .

s(x) =Qk

l=1 xsl

l and p(x) =Qk

Let ω be the germ of a k-form on (Km, 0). We denote by ω(r) the quasi-homogeneous

part of quasi-degree r in the Taylor series of ω.

Proposition 2.18. ([D1]) Let f be a quasi-homogeneous curve in (Km, 0). If [ω]f = 0 then
[ω(r)]f = 0 for any r.

This proposition allows us to deﬁne quasi-homogeneous algebraic restriction to a quasi-

homogeneous parameterized curve-germ.

Deﬁnition 2.19. Let a = [ω]f be an algebraic restriction to f . The algebraic restriction
a(r) = [ω(r)]f is called the quasi-homogeneous part of quasi-degree r of the algebraic
restriction a; and a is quasi-homogeneous of quasi-degree r if a = a(r).

Deﬁnition 2.20. Let f be a curve in (Km, 0). The germ X of a vector ﬁeld on (Km, 0) is
called liftable over f if there exists a function germ h on (K, 0) such that

h(cid:18) df

dt(cid:19) = X ◦ f.

The tangent space to the orbit of an algebraic restriction to f a is given by LXa for all
vector ﬁelds X liftable over f . The Lie derivative of an algebraic restriction with respect to
a liftable vector ﬁeld is well deﬁned since [LXθ]f = 0, for every k-form θ with zero algebraic
restriction (Proposition 6.8 [D1]).

5

Let f be a quasi-homogeneous parameterized curve-germ and let X be a smooth vector
ﬁeld. We denote by X (r) the quasi-homogeneous part of quasi-degree r in the Taylor series
of X. If X is liftable over f then X (r) is liftable over f (Proposition 6.11 in [D1]).

Let K(f ) be the minimal natural number such that all quasi-homogeneous algebraic
restrictions to f of closed 2-forms of quasi-degree greater than K(f ) vanish. By Theorem
2.13, K(f ) is ﬁnite.

Theorem 2.21. ([D1]) Let f (t) = (tλ1, . . . , tλk , 0, . . . , 0). Let Xs be the germ of a vector
ﬁeld such that Xs ◦ f = ts+1df /dt. Then the tangent space of the orbit of the quasi-
homogeneous algebraic restriction ar of quasi-degree r is spanned by LXsar for s that are
Z≥0-linear combinations of λ1, . . . , λk and are smaller than K(f ) − r.

We use the following result to obtain the normal forms of algebraic restrictions to a

parameterized quasi-homogeneous curve-germ under the action of local symmetries.

Theorem 2.22. ([D1]) Let a1, . . . , ap be a quasi-homogeneous basis of quasi-degrees δ1 ≤
. . . ≤ δs < δs+1 ≤ . . . ≤ δp of the space of algebraic restrictions of closed 2-forms to f .
j=s cjaj, where cj ∈ K for j = s, . . . , p and cs 6= 0. If there exists a liftable
quasi-homogeneous vector ﬁeld X over f such that LXas = rak for k > s and r 6= 0 then a

3 Discrete symplectic invariants

In [D1], [DJZ2] and [DT2] some symplectic invariants have been deﬁned. They are the
symplectic multiplicity, the index of isotropy and the Lagrangian tangency order. This
system of invariants is not enough to distinguish the orbits in the classiﬁcations in this
paper. We recall these invariants and introduce a new invariant for algebraic restrictions to
quasi-homogeneous parametrized curve-germs.

The ﬁrst invariant is the symplectic multiplicity [DJZ2] introduced in [IJ] as the sym-

plectic defect of a curve f .

Deﬁnition 3.1. The symplectic multiplicity µsympl(f ) of a curve f is the codimension
of the symplectic orbit of f in the A-orbit of f .

The symplectic multiplicity can be described in terms of algebraic restrictions.

Proposition 3.2. ([DJZ2]) The symplectic multiplicity of a quasi-homogeneous curve f
in a symplectic space is equal to the codimension of the orbit of the algebraic restriction
[ω]f with respect to the group of local diﬀeomorphisms preserving f in the space of algebraic
restrictions of closed 2-forms to f .

The second one is the index of isotropy.

Deﬁnition 3.3. The index of isotropy ι(f ) of f is the maximal order of vanishing of the
2-forms ω|T S over all smooth submanifolds S containing Im(f ).

Again we can describe the index of isotropy in terms of algebraic restrictions.

Proposition 3.4. ([DJZ2]) The index of isotropy of a quasi-homogeneous curve f in a
symplectic space (K2n, ω) is equal to the maximal order of vanishing of closed 2-forms rep-
resenting the algebraic restriction [ω]f

6

The Lagrangian tangency order was introduced in [D1] following the ideas in [A1]. If
H1 = · · · = Hn = 0 deﬁne a smooth submanifold L in the symplectic space M then the
tangency order of a curve f : K → M to L is the minimum of the orders of vanishing at 0
of the functions H1 ◦ f, . . . , Hn ◦ f . We denote the tangency order of f to L by t(f, L).

Deﬁnition 3.5. The Lagrangian tangency order Lt(f ) of a curve f is the maximum
of t(f, L) over all smooth Lagrangian submanifolds L of the symplectic space.

The Lagrangian tangency order of a quasi-homogeneous curve in a symplectic space can

also be expressed in terms of algebraic restrictions.

The order of vanishing of the germ of a 1-form α on a curve f at 0 is the minimum of
the orders of vanishing of the functions α(X) ◦ f at 0 over all germs of smooth vector ﬁelds
i=1 gidxi in local coordinates (x1, . . . , xm) then the order of vanishing of α on

f is the minimum of the orders of vanishing of functions gi ◦ f for i = 1, . . . , m.

X. If α =Pm

Proposition 3.6. ([D1]) Let f be the germ of a quasi-homogeneous curve such that the
algebraic restriction of a symplectic form to it can be represented by a closed 2-form van-
ishing at 0. Then Lagrangian tangency order of the germ of a quasi-homogeneous curve f
is the maximum of the orders of vanishing on f over all 1-forms α such that [ω]f = [dα]f .

Next we deﬁne an invariant to distinguish the diﬀerent orbits of algebraic restrictions to
quasi-homogeneous parameterized curve-germs of k-forms under the action of local symme-
tries. Let f : (K, 0) → (Km, 0) given by f (t) = (tλ1, . . . , tλs, 0, . . . , 0), where λ1 < · · · < λs
are positive integers linearly independent over non-negative integers.

Deﬁnition 3.7. Let a1, a2 be algebraic restrictions to f of k-forms on (Km, 0). Let r1, r2
be the smallest non-negative integers such that a(r1)
6= 0. We say that a1 and
a2 have proportional minimum quasi-degree part if r1 = r2 and

6= 0 and a(r2)

for some c ∈ K − {0}.

a(r1)
2 = ca(r1)

,

Lemma 3.8. Let f : (K, 0) → (Ks, 0) be a curve-germ given by f (t) = (tλ1 , . . . , tλs), where
λ1 < · · · < λs are positive integers linearly independent over non-negative integers.
If
Φ : (Ks, 0) → (Ks, 0) is a local symmetry of f then Φ is of the form

Φ(x) = (cλ1x1 + c1,2x2 + · · · + c1,sxs + ξ1(x),
cλ2x2 + c2,3x3 + · · · + c2,sxs + ξ2(x), · · · , cλsxs + ξs(x)),

(1)

where ci,j ∈ K and ξi ∈ M2
s.

Proof. If Φ : (Ks, 0) → (Ks, 0) is a local symmetry of f then there exists a germ of diﬀeo-
morphism φ : (K, 0) → (K, 0) such that Φ ◦ f = f ◦ φ. Then

Φ(tλ1, . . . , tλs) = (φ(t)λ1, . . . , φ(t)λs).

We can write φ(t) = ct + t2u(t), where u is smooth and c 6= 0. Then

Φ(tλ1, . . . , tλs) = (cλ1tλ1(1 +

tu(t)

c

)λ1 , . . . , cλstλs(1 +

tu(t)

c

)λs).

Since λ1 < · · · < λs are linearly independent over non-negative integers then Φ must be as
in (1).

7

Theorem 3.9. Let a1, a2 be algebraic restrictions to f of k-forms in (Km, 0). If a1 and a2
are diﬀeomorphic then they have proportional minimum quasi-degree part.

Proof. We can suppose f (t) = (tλ1, . . . , tλs) due to Proposition 2.15. Since a1 and a2 are
diﬀeomorphic then there exist a local symmetry Φ : (Ks, 0) → (Ks, 0) and φ : (K, 0) → (K, 0)
such that Φ ◦ f = f ◦ φ and Φ∗a1 = a2. Due to Lemma 3.8 Φ must be as in (1).

Let r1, r2 be the smallest non-negative integers such that a(r1)

6= 0 and a(r2)

2

6= 0.

Consider θ1 a k-form representing a1. The k-form θ(r1)

1

can be assumed as

θ(r1)

1 =X uI xγ1(I)

1

. . . xγs(I)

s

dxi1 ∧ . . . ∧ dxik ,

where I = i1, . . . , is, uI ∈ K and γ1(I), . . . , γs(I) are non-negative integers such that
is a monomial with quasi-degree r1 − λi1 − · · · − λik . Let η = θ1 − θ(r1)
xγ1(I)
.

We have

. . . xγs(I)

a2 = Φ∗a1 = Φ∗[θ1]f = [Φ∗(θ(r1)

]f + [Φ∗η]f .

One has [Φ∗η](j)

f = 0, for all j < r1 + 1. Moreover

Φ∗θ(r1)

1 = cr1θ(r1)

1 + ν,

where ν is a k-form such that ν(j) = 0, for all j < r1 + 1. We have

a2 = Φ∗a1 = Φ∗[θ1]f = cr1[θ(r1)

1

]f + [µ]f = cr1ar1

1 + [µ]f ,

where µ = Φ∗η+ν. Then r1 = r2 and a(r1)
minimum quasi-degree part.

2 = cr1a(r1)

1

. Therefore a1 and a2 have proportional

4 Symplectic singularities of curves with semigroup (4, 5, 6, 7)

The symplectic classiﬁcation of curves with semigroup (4, 5, 6, 7) is given by the following
Theorem.

Theorem 4.1. (i) Let (R2n, ω0 =Pn

i=1 dpi∧dqi) be the symplectic space with the canonical
coordinates (p1, q1, . . . , pn, qn). Then the germ of a curve f : (R, 0) → (R2n, 0) with
semigroup (4, 5, 6, 7) is symplectically equivalent to one and only one of the curves in
the second column of Table 1 for n = 2. When n = 3 f is symplectically equivalent
to one and only one of the curves in the second column and rows 1-14 of Table 2.
Finally when n ≥ 4 f is symplectically equivalent to one and only one of the curves
in the second column of Table 2.

(ii) The parameters c, c1, c2 and c3 are moduli.

The proof of Theorem 4.1 is done in the following steps. Due to Proposition 2.3 f is
A-equivalent to g(t) = (t4, t5, t6, t7, 0, . . . , 0). Due to Corollary 2.11, the classiﬁcation of
parameterized curve-germs with semigroup (4, 5, 6, 7) under the symplectic action is given
by the classiﬁcation of algebraic restrictions to g of symplectic forms under the action of
local symmetries of g. Due to Proposition 2.12, an algebraic restriction to g of a closed
2-form has a symplectic representative in R2n0, for some n0 ≥ 2. Proposition 4.2 provides
a basis for the vector space of algebraic restrictions of closed 2-forms to g. In Proposition
4.3 we ﬁnd a ﬁnite set of orbits of algebraic restrictions to g of symplectic forms. Finally,
we apply Corollary 2.11 and Proposition 4.3.

Proposition 4.2. A basis of the vector space of algebraic restrictions of closed 2-forms to
g is given by:

a9 = [dx1 ∧ dx2]g

a10 = [dx1 ∧ dx3]g

a+
11 = [dx2 ∧ dx3]g

a−
11 = [dx1 ∧ dx4]g

a12 = [dx2 ∧ dx4]g

a+
13 = [dx3 ∧ dx4]g

a−
13 = [x1dx1 ∧ dx2]g a14 = [x1dx1 ∧ dx3]g a−

15 = [x1dx1 ∧ dx4]g

Proof. This basis is obtained by the following algorithm on Singular software.

Proposition 4.3. Let a be an algebraic restriction to g of a symplectic form in (R2n, 0),
where n ≥ 2. Then a is diﬀeomorphic to one of the algebraic restrictions to g of Table

11

3 when n = 2. For n = 3 a is diﬀeomorphic to one of the algebraic restrictions to g in
the rows 1-14 of Table 4. Finally, when n ≥ 4 a is diﬀeomorphic to one of the algebraic
restrictions to g of Table 4.

For example, the algebraic restriction [ω1]g of Table 3 is represented by

ω1 = dx1 ∧ dx2 + c1dx1 ∧ dx4 + c2dx3 ∧ dx4 = dx1 ∧ (dx2 + c1dx4) + dx3 ∧ (c2dx4),

where c1, c2 ∈ R with c2 6= 0.

Consider F : (R4, 0) → (R4, 0) deﬁned by F (x) = (x1, x2 + c1x4, x3, c2x4). Let Ψ = F −1.

Note that Ψ∗ω1 = ω. Therefore f is symplectomorphic to

(Ψ−1 ◦ g)(t) = (F ◦ g)(t) = (t4, t5 + c1t7, t6, c2t7).

The symplectic multiplicity and the index of isotropy follow straightforward from The-
orem 3.2 and Theorem 3.4 respectively. The Lagrangian tangency order can be calculated
using Proposition 3.6 for the curves 15,16,17 and 18 from Table 2, the others curves we
calculate by deﬁnition.

We observe that although some curves in Tables 1 and 2 do have the same symplec-
tic invariants they are not symplectomorphic by Proposition 3.9 since the corresponding
algebraic restrictions do not have proportional minimum quasi-degree part.

Now we prove that the parameters c, c1, c2 are moduli in the normal forms. The proofs
are very similar in all cases. As an example we consider the orbit of [ω2]g = ±a10 + c1a−
11 +
c2a12, c1 6= 0 of Table 3. The tangent space to the orbit of [ω2]g is spanned by the algebraic
restrictions ±10a10 + 11c1a−
15. One can
easily see that a−

11 and a12 are not in this tangent space. Therefore c1 and c2 are moduli.

5 Symplectic singularities of curves with semigroup (4, 5, 6)

In this section we classify parameterized curve-germs with semigroup (4, 5, 6). We follow
the steps described in Section 4.

Theorem 5.1. (i) Let (R2n, ω0 = P dpi ∧ dqi) be the symplectic space with canonical co-

ordinates (p1, q1, . . . , pn, qn). Then the germ of a curve f : (R, 0) → (R2n, 0) with
semigroup (4, 5, 6) is symplectically equivalent to one and only one of the curves in
the second column and rows 1-3 of Table 6 for n = 2. When n > 2 f is symplectically
equivalent to one and only one of the curves in the second column of Table 6.

(ii) The parameters are c, c1, c2 moduli.

Let g : (R, 0) → (R2n, 0) given by g(t) = (t4, t5, t6, 0, . . . , 0). The proof of the next

Proposition is similar to the proof of Proposition 4.2.

Proposition 5.2. A basis of the vector space of algebraic restrictions of closed 2-forms to
g is given by:

a9 = [dx1 ∧ dx2]g

a10 = [dx1 ∧ dx3]g

a11 = [dx2 ∧ dx3]g

a13 = [x1dx1 ∧ dx2]

a14 = [x1dx1 ∧ dx3]g a15 = [x2dx1 ∧ dx3 + x1dx2 ∧ dx3]g
a17 = [x3dx2 ∧ dx3]g a19 = [x2

2dx1 ∧ dx2]g

Proposition 5.3. Let a be an algebraic restriction to g of a symplectic form in (R2n, 0),
where n ≥ 2. Then a is diﬀeomorphic to one of the algebraic restrictions to g in the rows
1-3 of Table 7 for n = 2. If n ≥ 3 then a is diﬀeomorphic to one of the algebraic restrictions
to g of Table 7.

Due to Propositions 2.12 and 5.2 a can be written as:

a = t9a9 + t10a10 + t11a11 + t13a13 + t14a14 + t15a15 + t17a17 + t19a19,

where ti ∈ R, i ∈ J = {9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19}.

Suppose ti 6= 0, for some i ∈ J and tu = 0, for all u < i. Considering the local symmetry
− 6
Ψi : (R3, 0) → (R3, 0) deﬁned by Ψi(x) = (s
i x3), where si = ti if i is odd
i
and si = |ti| if i is even, we can suppose ti = 1 if i is odd and ti = ±1 if i is even. By Theorem
2.22 we conclude that a is diﬀeomorphic to one of the following algebraic restrictions:

6. a15 + ca17

7. a17 + ca19

8. a19

If ti = 0, for all i, then a = [ω10]g. We prove in Lemma 5.4 that ±a10+c1a11+c2a13+c3a17

is diﬀeomorphic to ±a10 + c1a11 + c2a13 if c1 6= 0.

Lemma 5.4. Let a = ±a10 + c1a11 + c2a13 + c3a17. If c1 6= 0 then a is diﬀeomorphic to
±a10 + c1a11 + c2a13.

Proof. We use the Moser’s homotopy method. Let At = ±a10 + c1a11 + c2a13 + (1 − t)c3a17,
where t ∈ [0, 1]. Suppose there exists a family of local symmetries of g Φt : (R3, 0) → (R3, 0),
t ∈ [0, 1], such that

6 Classiﬁcation of curves with semigroup (4, 5, 7)

In this section we classify parameterized curve-germs with semigroup (4, 5, 7). Again, we
follow the steps as in Section 4.

Theorem 6.1. (i) Let (R2n, ω0 = P dpi ∧ dqi) be a symplectic space with canonical co-

ordinates (p1, q1, . . . , pn, qn). Then the germ of a curve f : (R, 0) → (R2n, 0) with
semigroup (4, 5, 7) is symplectically equivalent to one and only one of the curves in
the second column and rows 1-3 of Table 9 if n = 2. When n > 2 f is symplectically
equivalent to one and only one of the curves in the second column of Table 9.

(ii) The parameters c, c1, c2 are moduli.

Let a be an algebraic restriction to g of a symplectic form on R2n, n ≥ 2. Due to

Propositions 2.12 and 6.2, a can be written as

a = t9a9 + t11a11 + t12a12 + t13a13 + t14a14 + t15a15 + t16a16 + t17a17 + t18a18.

ti ∈ R, for all i ∈ {9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}.

Suppose ti 6= 0, for some i. In this case, we consider the local symmetry Ψi : (R3, 0) →
− 7
(R3, 0) deﬁned by Ψi(x) = (s
i x3), where si = ti if i is odd, and si = |ti|

if i is even. Thus we can suppose ti = 1 if i is odd or ti = ±1 if i is even. Applying the
Theorem 2.22 we conclude that a is diﬀeomorphic to one of the algebraic restrictions in the
rows 1-9 of the Table 10. If ti = 0, for all i, then a = [ω10]g.
