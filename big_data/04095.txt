THE RUDIN-SHAPIRO POLYNOMIALS AND THE FEKETE

POLYNOMIALS ARE NOT Lα-FLAT

EL HOUCEIN EL ABDALAOUI

Abstract. We establish that the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials are not Lα-ﬂat,
for any α ≥ 0. We further prove that the “truncated” Rudin-Shapiro sequence
cannot generate a sequence of Lα-ﬂat polynomials, for any α ≥ 0.
In the
appendix, we present a simple proof of the fact that the Fekete polynomials
and the modiﬁed or shifted Fekete polynomials are not Lα-ﬂat, for any α ≥ 0.

1. Introduction

The purpose of this note is to establish that the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials are
not Lα-ﬂat, for any α ≥ 0. This answers a question raised by B. Weiss [37]. We
thus obtain that the equivalence of the Lα-norms does not imply Lα-ﬂatness. We
further provide a simple and direct proof that the Fekete polynomials and the mod-
iﬁed or shifted Fekete polynomials are not Lα-ﬂat, for any α ≥ 0.

The Rudin-Shapiro polynomials were introduced independently by H. Shapiro
[35] and W. Rudin [34]. In the beginning, H. Shapiro introduced them in his 1951’s
Master thesis [35, p.39]. Precisely, he produced them in the study of two extremal
problems related to the well-known coeﬃcient problem of Landau [13, p.139]. Later,
by appealing essentially to the same methods, W. Rudin produced those polynomi-
als in [34] with the consent of H. Shapiro. Therein, the author answered positively a
question posed to him by Salem. Since then, the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials are the
powerful tool for building examples or counterexamples in many settings. Among

the most known examples is the one in which the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials are
used to establish the sharpness in Bernstein’s theorem [38, Vol I, p.240] which says
that the set of Lipschitz functions Lip(α) is contained in the space of functions with
an absolutely convergent Fourier series provided that α > 1/2.

The Rudin-Shapiro polynomials are also connected to the spectral theory of dy-
namical systems. This discovery was made by T. Kaeme [22] and M. Queﬀelec [32].
Indeed, they proved that the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials appear in the calculus
of the spectral type of a certain substitution called nowadays the Rudin-Shapiro
substitution. Their investigation yields that the spectrum of the Rudin-Shapiro
substitution has a Lebesgue component of multiplicity two. Before, J. Mathew and
M. G. Nadkarni constructed in [27] a transformation with a Lebesgue component
of multiplicity two. Of course, this gives a positive answer to the weak Rokhlin
problem. Nevertheless, it seems that the Rokhlin’s problem on ﬁnding an ergodic
measure preserving transformation on a ﬁnite measure space whose spectrum is
Lebesgue type with ﬁnite multiplicity is still unsolved [33, p.219]. This problem
is related to the well-known Banach’s problem whether a transformation measure-
preserving may have a simple Lebesgue spectrum [36, p.76]. For the Banach’s
problem, the transformation may act on the inﬁnite measure space and it is sup-
posed to be ergodic and non-dissipative.

The connection between Banach’s problem and some extremal problem for the
analytic trigonometric polynomials was established by J. Bourgain in [8]. Therein,
he proved that the singularity of the spectrum of the rank one maps is related
to the L1-ﬂatness of the analytic trigonometric polynomials with coeﬃcients in
{0, 1}. Later, M. Guenais [17] and Downarowicz-Lacroix [12] proved that the weak
Rokhlin’s problem is connected to the L1-ﬂatness in the class of the analytic trigono-
metric polynomials with coeﬃcients in {+1,−1}. Precisely, M. Guenais proved that
there exist a dynamical system with simple Lebesgue component if and only if there
exist a sequence of analytic trigonometric polynomials Pn, n = 1, 2,··· whose ab-
solute values | Pn |, n = 1, 2,··· converge to 1 in L1, and such that for each n, the
coeﬃcients of Pn are ±1. Downarowicz and Y. Lacroix established that the weak
Rokhlin’s problem has a positive answer provided that there exist the so-called
Barker sequences of arbitrary high length.

Recently, E. H. el Abdalaoui and M. Nadkarni proved that the weak Rokhlin’s
problem has an aﬃrmative answer in the class of nonsingular transformations of
a Lebesgue probability space [2]. Therein, the authors produced a sequence of
ultraﬂat polynomials Pn, n = 1, 2,··· with real coeﬃcients, where for each n the
coeﬃcients of Pn, n = 1, 2,··· are not equal in absolute value, but which can be
used to construct non-singular ergodic maps with the desired spectral property. We
also mention that Guenais has constructed a concrete ergodic measure preserving
group action whose unitary group admits a Haar component of multiplicity one in

its spectrum. Guenais’s construction is done by appealing to the ultraﬂat Fekete
polynomials deﬁned on some countable discrete torsion Abelian group [4].

Very recently, the author in [1] settled the Banach Scottish problem by prov-
ing that there exists a rank one map acting on inﬁnite measure space with simple
Lebesgue spectrum. Therein, the author established that there exist an L1-ﬂat
polynomials from the class B or the so-called Newman polynomials. The con-
struction of such polynomials is based on Singer’s construction and on the nice
combinatoric properties of Sidon sets and Singer sets. The proof is accomplished as
a consequence of the sharper results from the H p theory and the Carleson interpo-
lation theory. Consequently, the author obtained a positive answer to the problems
attributed to Littlewood and Mahler. For more details, we refer to [1].

Here, in connection with the Littlewood problem on the ﬂatness of the poly-
nomials with coeﬃcients ±1, we shall prove that the Rudin-Shapiro polynomials
are not Lα-ﬂat for α ≥ 0. This result supports the conjecture mentioned by D. J.
Newman in [29] which says that all the analytic trigonometric polynomials P with
coeﬃcients ±1 satisfy

(cid:13)(cid:13)P(cid:13)(cid:13)1 < c(cid:13)(cid:13)P(cid:13)(cid:13)2,

for some positive constant c < 1.

According to M. Guenais’s result [17] and Downarowicz-Lacroix contribution
[12], the previous conjecture can be translated in the language of dynamical systems
and the language of coding and information theory respectively as follows:

Conjecture (On the Morse cocyle). The Morse cocycles with simple Lebesgue
component do not exist.

Conjecture (On the Barker sequences). The Barker sequences of arbitrary length
do not exist.

The paper is organized as follows.

We further give a short and a direct proof of the fact that the Fekete polyno-
mials and the modiﬁed or shifted Fekete polynomials are not Lα-ﬂat, for any α ≥ 0.
In section 2, we review some basic tools
and we state our main result. In section 3, we prove it. Finally, in the appendix,
we present a simple proof of the fact that Fekete polynomials and shifted Fekete
polynomials are not Lα-ﬂat, for any α ≥ 0.

2. Basic definitions and tools

Let S1 denote the circle group and dz the normalized Lebesgue measure on S1.

The Rudin-Shapiro polynomials are deﬁned inductively as follows




P0 = Q0 = 1,
Pn+1(z) = Pn(z) + z2n
Qn+1(z) = Pn(z) − z2n

Qn(z),
Qn(z),

and
for n ≥ 0 and z ∈ S1.

It can be easily seen by induction that Pn and Qn are analytic trigonometric poly-
nomials of degree 2n − 1 with coeﬃcients ±1. Let {rk}2n−1
k=0 be re-
spectively the sequence of coeﬃcients of the polynomials Pn and Qn. We thus
have

k=0 and {r′k}2n−1

r′k =(cid:26) rk,
−rk,

if k < 2n−1;
if not.

The sequence rk, k = 0,··· , is nowadays called the Golay-Rudin-Shapiro sequence
1. Such a sequence veriﬁes

(2.1)

r0 = 1,

rn = (cid:26) rn/2,

(−1)[n/2]r[n/2],

if n is even;
if n is odd,

as customary, [x] denotes the integer part of x. It has been shown by Brillart and

j=0 ǫj2j is a dyadic representation of n, then

Carlitz [5] that if n =PNn
where s(n) =PNn−1
ǫjǫj+1. Therefore, one can deﬁne rn in a combinatoric manner
by considering s(n) as the occurrence number of “11” in the dyadic representation
of n. For that it suﬃces to see that (−1)s(n) satisﬁes the Golay-Rudin-Shapiro
properties (2.1).

rn = (−1)s(n),

j=0

The relationship between the Golay-Rudin-Shapiro sequence and the substitu-
tion has been established by G. Christol, T. Kamae, M. Mend`es France and G.
Rauzy in [10].
Indeed, therein, the authors proved that rn is a 2-automatic se-
quence, obtained from a primitive substitution ξ of length two on a four-letters
alphabet {0, 1, 2, 3} given by

ξ(0) = 02
ξ(1) = 32

ξ(2) = 01
ξ(3) = 31,

with the ﬁxed point u = ξ∞(0) which generated the Rudin-Shapiro dynamical
system. We further have rn = π(un), where π : {0, 1, 2, 3} −→ {+1,−1} projects

1This terminology is due to Brillhart & Morton [6].

0, 2 onto 1 and 0, 3 on −1. This can be seen by deﬁning the following words on the
alphabet {+1,−1}

An = r0 ··· r2n−1, and Bn = r2n ··· r2n+1−1.

We deﬁne the Rudin-Shapiro conjugate transform on the word A ∈ [n∈N(cid:8) + 1,−1(cid:9)n

by

We thus have

A(i) =(cid:26) +1,
−1,

if A(i) = −1;
if not.

An+1 = AnBn, and Bn+1 = AnBn.

Subsequently, we construct the ﬁxed point by coding A as 0, B as 1, the conju-
gate of A as 2 and the conjugate of B as 3. For the construction of the stage n + 1,
the rule is given by ξ.

We end this section by recalling that a sequence Pn(z), n = 1, 2,··· of analytic
trigonometric polynomials of L2(S1, dz) norm 1 is said to be L1-ﬂat if the sequence
|Pn(z)|, n = 1, 2,··· converges in L1-norm to the constant function 1 as n → ∞.
More generally, we say that (Pn) is Lα-ﬂat if |Pn(z)|, n = 1, 2,··· converges in
Lα-norm to the constant function 1, for α > 0 or α = +∞. For α = 0, we say that
(Pn) is Lα-ﬂat, if the Mahler measures M (Pn) converge to 1. We remind that the
Mahler measure of a function f ∈ L1(S1, dz) is deﬁned by

M (f ) = kfk0 = lim

β−→0kfkβ = exp(cid:16)ZS1

log(|f (t)|)dt(cid:17).

In the following, we generalize the characterization of L1-ﬂatness obtained in [1]

to the case of Lα-ﬂatness for 0 < α ≤ 2.
Proposition 2.1 (Characterization of Lα-ﬂatness, 0 < α ≤ 2.). Let (Pn) be a
sequence of L2-normalized analytic trigonometric polynomials and 0 < α ≤ 2.
Then, the following assertions are equivalent

(i) (Pn) are Lα/2-ﬂat.

(2.2)

Proof. We start by proving that (ii) and (iii) are equivalent. Assume that (ii)
holds. Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

− 1(cid:12)(cid:12)dz = Z (cid:12)(cid:12)Pn(z)(cid:12)(cid:12)α/2

But, since 0 < α ≤ 2, we have

Therefore, we can rewrite (2.2) as follows

to 1 as n −→ +∞ implies that (cid:13)(cid:13)Pn(cid:13)(cid:13)1 converges to 1 as n −→ +∞, since α/2 ≤ 1.
Moreover,(cid:13)(cid:13)Pn(cid:13)(cid:13)1 converges to 1 as n −→ +∞ is equivalent to(cid:13)(cid:13)|Pn|− 1(cid:13)(cid:13)1 converges

The ﬂatness problem has nowadays a long story, and it turn out that the ﬂat
polynomials can be used to design signals for use in digital transmission systems.
Consequently, the increasing interest in the ﬂatness problem is fueled by the need
for the pseudo random sequences suitable for application in ﬁelds such as trans-
mission and encryption. For more details, we refer the reader to [1], [23] and [19].
Here, we shall prove the following

For a nice account on the merit factor problem, we refer the reader to [19].

We proceed to prove by contradiction our main result for α = 1. Suppose that

the sequence (RN ) is L1-ﬂat. Then, we can assert that

It follows that we can extract a subsequence (Xn′) such that |Xn′| converges a.e.
to 1. But (|Xn|4)n≥0 is uniformly bounded (Thanks to (3.5)). Therefore, by the

(Xn) is not L1-ﬂat.

Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem, we can assert that(cid:13)(cid:13)Xn(cid:13)(cid:13)4 converges to

We further claim that we have

Following the authors, this conjecture seems to be supported by the extensive
numerical evidence employing the Bose-Einstein statistics methodology of statis-
tical mechanic. Notice that this conjecture solves the merit factor problem which
says that the minimum of the L4-norm of the L2-normalized analytic polynomials
with ±1 coeﬃcients is great than 1 + δ for some δ > 0. We remind that the ana-
lytic polynomials with ±1 coeﬃcients are nowdays called Littlewood polynomials.
Of course, this conjecture implies that the L4-uniformly integrable sequence of
Littlewood polynomials can not be L1-ﬂat. We further notice that Newman-
Byrnes’s conjecture implies that Erd¨os conjecture holds. Let us recall that Erd¨os
conjecture for the class of Littlewood polynomials says that for any L2-normalized

Littlewood polynomials P , we have(cid:13)(cid:13)P(cid:13)(cid:13)∞ ≥ (1 + C) for some constant C > 0 [14].

Appendix A. On the Fekete polynomials.

Let p be a prime number. The Fekete polynomials are deﬁned by

Qp(z) =

p(cid:19) zk,
(cid:18) k

p−1Xk=1

where (cid:18) k

p(cid:19) is the Legendre symbol. We recall that the Legendre symbol is given

by

The Fekete polynomials are intimately linked to the Gauss sum given by

p(cid:19) =
(cid:18) k


0,
1,
−1,
G2(χ) =Xn

if k = 0;
if a square modulo p;
if not.

χ(n)ωn

p = Qp(ωp),

where χ(n) = (cid:18) k

p(cid:19) and ωp is the p-root of unity given by ωp = e2πi1/p. In his

1811’s paper, Gauss proved the following

Qp(ωk

p ) = ǫp√p(cid:18) k

p(cid:19) , k = 0,··· , p − 1,

where ǫp is deﬁned by

ǫp =(cid:26) 1,

i,

if p ≡ 1 (mod 4);
if p ≡ 3 (mod 4).

For the proof of the Gauss formula, we referee to [9, p.10]. We thus get

(A.1)

(cid:12)(cid:12)Qp(ωk

p )(cid:12)(cid:12) = √p,

for any k = 0,··· , p − 1. It follows that the Fekete polynomials may possibly be
a candidate to solve the Littlewood’s well-known problem whether there exists a
sequence of analytic trigonometric polynomials Pn with coeﬃcients ±1 such that

c.(cid:13)(cid:13)Pn(cid:13)(cid:13)2 ≤(cid:12)(cid:12)Pn(z)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C.(cid:13)(cid:13)Pn(cid:13)(cid:13)2,

for all z ∈ S1 and for two absolute positive constants c, C. Unfortunately,
Montgomery in [28] proved that there is an absolute constant c such that

√p log(log(p)) <(cid:13)(cid:13)Qp(cid:13)(cid:13)∞

def= sup

z∈S1(cid:12)(cid:12)Qp(z)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ c√p log(p).

In [15], Erd´elyi and Lubinsky observed that if p ≡ 1 (mod 4) then the Fekete
polynomials are not L1-ﬂat by applying the following Littlewood’s criterion.

14

for some absolute constant k. Then, for any α > 0 there exists a constant A(k, α)
such that

kfnkα ≤(cid:0)1 − A(k, α)(cid:1)kfnk2,
kfnkα ≥(cid:0)1 + A(k, α)(cid:1)kfnk2,

if α < 2;
if α > 2.

In order to apply the criterion of Littlewood we observe that if p ≡ 1 (mod 4) then
Qp is self-reciprocal, that is,

Hence

z(cid:17) = Qp(z).

Qp(t) = e2it

ak cos((2k + 1)t), ak = ±2.

Here, we shall prove the following.

Theorem A.2. The Fekete polynomials are not Lα-ﬂat for any α ≥ 0.
For that we need the following theorem due Høholdt and Jensen [16].

(cid:4)

Theorem A.3. The L4-norm of the L2-normalized Fekete polynomials verify

kQpk4

p −−−−−→p→+∞

.

The exact formula of kQpk4 in term of the number of class of Q(√−p) was

obtained by Browein and Choi [7]. Very recently, G¨unther and Schmidt in [18]
established a formula for the limit of the L2q-norm where q is a positive integer.

We further needs some classical and fundamental ingredient from the modern
probabilistic literature. This ingredient seems to be useful in some problem related
to the almost sure convergence.

Of course, it is obvious that the almost everywhere convergence does not in general
imply the convergence in Lp(X). Nevertheless, it is well known that the condition of
domination insure such convergence (Lebesgue’s Dominated Convergence Theorem)
but in the absence of domination the following Vital Convergence Theorem allows
us to obtain the convergence in Lp(X) provided that the sequence is uniformly
integrability.

Theorem A.4 (Vitali Convergence Theorem ). Let (X,B, µ) be a probability space,
p a positive number and {fn} a sequence in Lp(X) which converges in probability
to f . Then, the following are equivalent:
(i) (|fn|p)n≥0 is uniformly integrable;
(ii) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)fn − f(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p −−−−−→n→+∞
(iii) ZX |fn|pdµ −−−−−→n→+∞ ZX |f|pdµ.

0.

For the proof of Theorem A.4 we refer the reader to [11, pp.101].

We remind that the condition

sup

n∈N(cid:16)ZX(cid:12)(cid:12)fn(cid:12)(cid:12)1+ε

dµ(cid:17) < +∞,

for some ε positive, implies that {fn} are uniformly integrable.

The third ingredient we need is the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequality [38, Vol.
II, p. 30]. The Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequality asserts that for any α ∈]1, +∞[
there are two positive constants A(α), B(α) such that

n−1Xj=0(cid:12)(cid:12)P (e2πi j

for any polynomial P of degree at most n − 1.

We are now ready to proof Theorem A.2.

Proof of Theorem A.2. We start by noting that for any α ≥ 0, there is a con-
stant cα such that,

kQpkα ≤ cα,

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

for any prime number p. This is an easy application of the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund
inequality (A.2) combined with Gauss formula (A.1). Assume that for some α > 0,
Qp is Lα-ﬂat, Then

(cid:12)(cid:12)Qp(z)(cid:12)(cid:12)√p − 1(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)α −−−−−→p→+∞
This gives that there is a subsequence (pn) for which the sequence(cid:16)|Qp|√p (cid:17) converges
almost everywhere to 1. But (cid:16) |Qpn|4
pn (cid:17) is uniformly integrable, hence
Qpn√pn(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)4 −−−−−→n→+∞
(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

by Vital convergence theorem A.4. This contradicts Theorem 3.8. We thus get that
for any α ≥ 0, the Fekete polynomials are not Lα-ﬂat as in the proof of Theorem
2.2.

Questions. Our work suggests the following naturel question. Let p be a prime
number and q = p2 + p + 1. Assume that S ⊂ Z/qZ is a Singer set and put
T = S + S. By the nice combinatorial properties of Singer sets we know that if
x = a + b then this representation is essentially unique: there is one representation
if a = b and there are two if a a 6= b , namely x = a + b = b + a. Whence
