We present evidence of strain-induced modulation of electron correlation eﬀects and increased
orbital anisotropy in the rutile phase of epitaxial VO2/TiO2 ﬁlms from hard x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy and soft V L-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy, respectively. By using the U(1)
slave spin formalism, we further argue that the observed anisotropic correlation eﬀects can be
understood by a model of orbital selective Mott transition at a ﬁlling that is non-integer, but close
to the half-ﬁlling. Because the overlaps of wave functions between d orbitals are modiﬁed by the
strain, orbitally-dependent renormalizations of the bandwidths and the crystal ﬁelds occur with the
application of strain. These renormalizations generally result in diﬀerent occupation numbers in
diﬀerent orbitals. We ﬁnd that if the system has a non-integer ﬁlling number near the half-ﬁlling
such as for VO2, certain orbitals could reach an occupation number closer to half-ﬁlling under the
strain, resulting in a strong reduction in the quasiparticle weight Zα of that orbital. Moreover, an
orbital selective Mott transition, deﬁned as the case with Zα = 0 in some, but not all orbitals, could
be accessed by epitaxial strain-engineering of correlated electron systems.

Introduction – Mott insulators are characterized by the
ratio of U/W , where U refers to the correlation strength
and W is the full bandwidth. A Mott state is usually
predicted from theoretical models to exist in materials at
half ﬁlling and when U/W ∼ 1. However in multi-orbital
systems an incipient Mott picture has been proposed
with the possibility of an “orbital selective Mott tran-
sition” (OSMT). The OSMT scenario was ﬁrst proposed
to understand the physical properties of Ca2−xSrxRuO4
by Anisimov[1], stimulating a lot of research eﬀorts on
this subject.[2–6] More recently, in the iron based su-
perconductors, OSMT has been suggested to account for
the insulating properties driven by the iron vacancy in
[7–14] In general, the physics of OSMT
K1−xFe2−ySe2.
has relevance to a variety of multi-band materials that
are close to a Mott transition, and a better understand-
ing of this phase both theoretically and experimentally
would be crucial for advancing our understanding of Mott
physics.

Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is one of the early prototypes
for strongly correlated systems near half ﬁlling.[15, 16]
VO2 exhibits a metal to insulator transition (MIT) with
a concomitant formation of V-V dimers that is generally
considered to be driven cooperatively by both Mott and
Peierls physics.[16–20] For example, it has been pointed
out that the massive orbital switching that occurs upon
entering the insulating phase can only be achieved if the
system is already close to a Mott insulating regime.[16] A

signiﬁcant theoretical eﬀort has been made to understand
this MIT using local density approximation (LDA), LDA
+ U, LDA + DMFT, etc. [16, 19, 21, 22] Speciﬁcally, a
Peierls-assisted OSMT mechanism has been proposed to
understand the MIT between metallic R and insulating
M 1 phases in bulk VO2.[22] Furthermore, recent progress
in ultra thin epitaxial VO2 growth using TiO2 substrates
has provided surmounting evidence that electron corre-
lation eﬀects may become enhanced by the large strains,
thus pushing the system further into the Mott regime
without introducing any dopants.[23–26]. These results
suggest that VO2 is a candidate for exploring the OSMT
with epitaxial strain.

In this Letter we present a generalized theory of OSMT
to describe how strain can result in quasiparticle weight
variation and preferential orbital switching. We perform
theoretical calculations to show that an OSMT can be
tuned within the metallic phase of VO2 (R-phase) by ap-
plying a strain that enhances the electron correlations.
We ﬁnd that the application of a uniaxial strain tends to
make the occupation number on each orbital unequal. As
a result, even if the system is slightly away from half ﬁll-
ing, the presence of a moderate anisotropic strain along
particular directions could render the occupation num-
ber in certain orbitals closer to half-ﬁlling, leading to an
OSMT. Further, by performing hard x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (HAXPES) and V L-edge x-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) on 10 nm epitaxial VO2 ﬁlms on

TiO2(001), (100) and (110), referred to as VO2(001),
VO2(100), and VO2(110) (see Supplementary), we show
that strain induced electronic eﬀects indeed exist in the
metallic phase of VO2, in an agreement with our theo-
retical predictions.

Model and Formalism – We have employed the U (1)
slave spin formalism[10] on a two orbital model to inves-
tigate the eﬀect of strain on the quasiparticle weight near
the transition to the featureless Mott phase. The slave
spin formalism[6] has been shown to reproduce the Mott
transition at the mean-ﬁeld level in good agreement with
DMFT results, and the U (1) version can even obtain the
correct non-interacing limit at the mean-ﬁeld level.[9] We
start from a generic two orbital model containing a tight
binding Hamiltonian and a multi-orbital Hubbard inter-
action term representing onsite electron correlations (see
Supplementary Materials). Below we brieﬂy summarize
the mechanism for studying OSMT in a U (1) slave spin
formalism[10] applied to our model Hamiltonian.

Representing the charge degree of freedom by a quan-
tum spin 1/2, the electron creation operator d†iασ can
be written as d†iασ = S +
iασf†iασ, where d†iασ creates an
electron on the orbital α with spin σ at site i, S +
iασ is
the spin raising operator for the slave spin describing
a charge on the orbital α with physical spin σ on the
site i, and f†iασ is the fermionic spinon associated with
the physical spin. After solving the mean-ﬁeld equations
subject to the constraints to eliminate the unphysical
Hilbert spaces due to the introduction of the slave spins,
the quasiparticle weight on orbital α can be obtained
by Zασ ∝ |hS +
ασi|2.[10] Finally, the correlated metallic
phase (Mott insulating phase) corresponds to Zασ 6= 0
(Zασ = 0) for every orbital, and the OSMT is given by
Zασ = 0 for some orbitals. Note that the OSMT is not a
complete insulating state since the quasiparticle weight
in certain bands is still ﬁnite. We perform the calcula-
tions at zero temperature and limit our attention only on
the featureless Mott insulating phases. As a result, we
have hnασi = nα
2 and Zασ = Zα. In a two orbital model,
the half-ﬁlling is corresponding to n = n1 + n2 = 2, and
we focus on the case with 1 < n < 2.

Results – Although the generic tight binding model
can describe any two orbital system, we begin by choos-
ing a dxz and dyz two orbital system for the purpose of
demonstration (see Supplementary Materials). Now as-
sume that the strain is applied to elongate the system
along ˆx direction. This strain signiﬁcantly reduces the
wave function overlaps associated with the dxz but has
much less eﬀect on the wave function overlaps associated
with the dyz. As a result, the bandwidth of dxz orbital
should reduce, and we may introduce an eﬀective param-
eter d such that t11,strain
Here t11 is the
hopping matrix element associated with the dxz orbital
and (1 − d) reﬂects the bandwidth reduction in the dxz
orbital. As a test, we have studied the case with C4 sym-
metry and d = 0, which is summarized in Supplementary

FIG. 1: The orbitally-dependent quasiparticle weight in the
case under the strain with U = 4.5 for diﬀerent ﬁlling n. At
the ﬁlling away from the half-ﬁlling (n = 1), the quasiparticle
weights remain almost the same even at large d. In contrast,
at the ﬁlling near the half-ﬁlling (n = 1.8 and n = 1.9),
the quasiparticle weight in dxz (Z1) reduces signiﬁcantly as d
increases.

Materials.

Now we turn on the strain by setting d 6= 0. There
are two eﬀects of d on the dxz orbital. First, since the
its bandwidth W1 is reduced, the ratio of the interaction
to the bandwidth U/W1 increases, leading to stronger
correlation eﬀect on dxz orbital. Second, if n < 2, the
reduction of the bandwidth W1 tends to attract more
electrons to occupy dxz orbital. Therefore we can expect
that under the strain, n1 = n/2 + x and n2 = n/2 − x.
This indicates that dxz orbital is pushed even closer to the
half-ﬁlling and consequently much more correlated. As a
result, both eﬀects favor driving dxz more correlated, and
an OSMT could be obtained if n is near the half-ﬁlling.
The orbitally-dependent quasiparticle weight Zα as a
function of strain with ﬁxed U at diﬀerent n is presented
in Fig. 1. For n = 1, the strain does not aﬀect Zα
too much even at quite large d. As n is closer to 2, the
diﬀerence between Z1 and Z2 becomes more prominent,
consistent with our discussion above. It should be noted
that this result is quite general for a multi-orbital sys-
tem, and an intriguing point is that one could engineer
the OSMT by the strain eﬀect even in a system with
non-integer ﬁllings.
In the next section, we study the
MIT in VO2 under high strain using the same formalism
developed above.

Application to epitaxially strained VO2 – Although the
origin of the MIT in VO2 is a complicated issue, the dom-
inant bands near the Fermi surface are well-known. The
orbital compositions of the three dominant bands near
the Fermi surface can be expressed as |σ(dk)i = |x2 −y2i,
and |π±i = 1√2
(|xzi ± |yzi). While the leading hopping
parameter of σ band mostly comes from the strong di-
rect σ bonding between nearest V − V pairs, the leading

hopping parameters of π± bands come from a combina-
tion of the direct π bonding between nearest V − V pairs
and the second order hoppings via the V − O bonds be-
tween 3d and 2p orbitals.[16, 27] Tanaka estimated[27]
|tσσ| ∼ |tπ−π−| >> |tπ+π+ |, which is in close agreement
with LDA calculations.[16] Moreover, due to the crys-
tal ﬁeld eﬀect coming from the oxygen atoms, π± bands
are pushed to the higher energy, leading to a lower on-
site energy in the σ band. As a result, this system can
be reasonably approximated as a two-band system with
comparable bandwidths in the metallic R phase. A strain
on VO2 due to the (110) or (100)-oriented TiO2 sub-
strate leads to two important eﬀects that support the
OSMT scenario. Firstly, because the c-axis lattice con-
stant of the bulk TiO2 is longer than that of bulk VO2
by 3.62%[28], the c-axis is stretched in both VO2(110)
and VO2(100) (note that the ˆx-direction in the tetrag-
onal unit cell is along the c-axis[19, 29]). It is found in
LDA calculations that a longer c-axis primarily leads to
a reduction of the σ orbital hoppings tσσ and suppression
of the corresponding band width Wσ.[29] Consequently a
larger U/Wσ would enhance the electronic correlations in
σ band. Secondly, due to the elongation of c-axis, the av-
erage V − O bond length would shorten, which enhances
the d − p hybridizations, increases the on-site energy of
π orbital, and leads to a larger energy diﬀerence between
the σ and π orbitals. For simplicity, we model the change
in the onsite energy as an eﬀective lowering of σ orbital
on-site energy. The eﬀects of the strain can then be taken
into account by

tσσ,strain

(1)

where C is a positive constant. It can be seen easily that
both eﬀects from the strain strongly favor more occupa-
tion numbers in the σ band, thus pushing it closer to half
ﬁlling.

Moreover, because of the large hybridization between
3d orbitals of V and 2p orbitals of O, the total occu-
pation number in 3d orbitals is in fact in the range of
n = 1.2 − 2 instead of 1 as one might expect from a di-
rect counting of the valence charges. Consequently, the
OSMT due to the strain eﬀect discussed in the last sec-
tion is very likely to occur with a moderate d. We adopt
the values of tσσ, tπ−π−, and the onsite energies derived
in Ref.
[27] and Eq. 1 to model the strain eﬀect. The
quasiparticle weight in the σ band Zσ at n = 1.5 as a
function of U and d is plotted in Fig. 2. For small U , Zσ
remains close to 1 and does not depend on d. As U in-
creases, Zσ develops a signiﬁcant dependence on d, and
an orbital selective Mott transition occurs at a critical
d = dc if U is large enough. Clearly, dc decreases as U
increases, indicating that the OSMT is indeed driven by
the strong Coulomb repulsive interaction. Furthermore,
we notice that the behavior would be fundamentally dif-

ferent when the c-axis is compressed rather than elon-
gated, as is the case for VO2(001). This will shorten σ
bond distance along the c-direction and would reduce the
energy diﬀerence between σ and π orbitals, thus keeping
their occupations away from half ﬁlling in the R phase.
As a result, the OSMT would be expected to occur in
VO2(100) and VO2(110), but not in VO2(001).

We emphasize that the increase of the occupation num-
ber in the σ band is a direct consequence of the balance
between kinetic and interaction energies. Because the
bandwidth and the eﬀective onsite energy of the σ band
are both lowered by the strain, it is energetically favor-
able to put more electrons in the σ than in the π− bands
to compromise the interaction energy. While this trend in
the occupation numbers can be captured by LDA-based
approaches, the signiﬁcant change in the quasiparticle
weight as well as the OSMT found here is attributed to
the advantage of the U (1) slave spin formalism. We pre-
dict that the occupation number in the σ band could be
substantially increased under the strain even in R phase
without the dimerization of V − V pairs, and the metal-
lic phase in this region would be a strongly correlated
metallic state with vanishing quasiparticle weight in the
σ band Zσ.

To investigate the predicted eﬀect of strain on VO2
thin ﬁlms, we have performed HAXPES and polarization
dependent XAS of the V L-edge on VO2(001), VO2(100),
and VO2(110) in the metallic R phase close to the MIT
(see Supplementary). Figure 3a shows the HAXPES of
the topmost valence states, while ﬁg. 3b shows the cor-
responding V L XAS spectra collected from each VO2
ﬁlm. All presented spectra are collected at ∼20 ◦C above

TMIT , i.e. in the metallic phase. The XAS at the V L-
edge were collected with the polarization vector either
parallel to the [001] (EkcR) or [110] (E⊥cR) crystallo-
graphic axis. Included at the bottom of ﬁg. 3b are the
diﬀerence spectra (EkcR - E⊥cR) representing the linear
orbital dichroism.

Both the valence band HAXPES and weak orbital
dichroism of the VO2(001) closely resemble that of bulk
VO2.[16, 20, 30] In contrast, both the VO2(100) and
(110) ﬁlms show dramatic deviations from the bulk. The
sharp Fermi edge at EF , indicating Fermi liquid behavior,
is weakened in the VO2(100) case and further so for the
(110) case resulting in a more smeared out intensity dis-
tribution near the Fermi energy. This behavior is equiva-
lent to the vanishing Zσ in our model and is typically seen
in Mott insulating materials such as in parent cuprate
superconductors.[15, 31] Along with these changes at EF
are concurrent increases in orbital anisotropy observed
in the V L-edge spectra of the VO2(100) and VO2(110)
ﬁlms, indicating preferential ﬁlling of certain bands. This
demonstrates that the strain, speciﬁcally when the c-axis
is elongated, can indeed eﬀect both the electron correla-
tions and the orbital occupancy.

The orbital dichroism observed here in the VO2(100)
and VO2(110) ﬁlms tends toward that observed for the
insulating phase of unstrained VO2, despite remaining in
the metallic phase. Haverkort et al. [16] observed a dra-
matic switching of the orbital occupancy going from the
high temperature rutile to low temperature M1 phase,
in which the σ (often referred to as dk) orbital becomes
preferentially ﬁlled. Our results indicate a similar modiﬁ-
cation of the orbital occupancy purely induced by strain

4

within the distorted rutile structure. Remarkably, the
increased preferential ﬁlling of the σ orbital in this case
does not require the formation of V–V dimers, supporting
our OSMT picture.

Consistent with our OSMT prediction for VO2, the
weak orbital dichroism and the sharp Fermi edge for
VO2(001), when the c-axis is contracted, resemble that
of the bulk. Furthermore, we observe that while both
VO2(110) and VO2(100) have the same stretched c-axis,
VO2(110) exhibits larger orbital dichroism, as well as a
weaker Fermi edge, indicating that VO2(110) is more cor-
related than VO2(100). This diﬀerence can be attributed
to the compression along the out-of-plane direction of the
ﬁlm due to the compensation of the biaxial strain, which
is ignored in our theory. The compression in VO2(110)
is along rutile (110) direction (the ˆy-direction in the unit
cell)[19, 29], thus directly eﬀecting the V-O bond lengths.
This serves to increase the on-site energy of π orbital
due to the enhanced d − p hybridization, which leads to
a larger energy diﬀerence between the σ and π orbitals.
However, in VO2(100) the compression decreases the dis-
tance between V atoms along the rutile a-axis (the (ˆy− ˆz)
direction in the unit cell)[19, 29], having a less direct ef-
fect on the V-O bond lengths. As a result, the strain
eﬀects distinguishing σ and π orbitals are expected to be
stronger in VO2(110). More rigorous theoretical eﬀorts
are required to obtain a quantitative description in this
aspect.

Conclusion – To summarize, we have studied the ef-
fect of strain on multiorbital systems. Because the spa-
tial proﬁle of the orbital wave function are anisotropic,
the strain-induced bandwidth reduction and the onsite
energy due to the crystal ﬁeld eﬀect become orbitally-
dependent. Based on the U (1) slave spin formalism on
a generic two orbital Hubbard model, we have demon-
strated that if the system has a total ﬁlling which is
non-integer, but close to the half-ﬁlling, an orbital se-
lective Mott transition could be engineered by the ap-
plication of strain if the system has strong Coulomb re-
pulsive interactions. By applying this theory to study
the highly strained VO2 in combination with experimen-
tal results from spectroscopic studies, we have proposed
that an orbital selective Mott state exists in the high
temperature phase of coherently strained VO2 with an
elongated c-axis. This state could appear before the
M2 phase emerges, which explains why the region of M2
phase found in experiments is much narrower than the
prediction of Landau-Ginzburg theory.[25]. Our results
indicate that Mott physics is crucial to understand the
properties of VO2.

It is instructive to study the case with C4 symmetry

Clearly, at n away from the half-ﬁlling, Z remains close

decreases much more signiﬁcantly as U increases. Fig. 4

annealing to have clean and well-deﬁned step and terrace
microstructured surfaces. Vanadium and distilled ozone
were codeposited onto the substrate held at 250 ◦C under
a distilled ozone background pressure of 1.0×10−6 Torr.
Following deposition of the desired 10 nm ﬁlm thickness,
the temperature of the sample was rapidly ramped to
350 ◦C, then immediately cooled to below 100 ◦C un-
der the same background pressure of distilled ozone to
achieve an improved ﬁlm smoothness and a more abrupt
MIT. For further details, the reader is referred to Paik
et al. [23].

The HAXPES measurements were performed using a
photon energy of hν = 5.934 keV and a pass energy of
200 eV, with a corresponding resolution better than 200

meV. The binding energy axes were referenced to both
the Au 4f7/2 and Fermi edge of a Au foil in electrical
contact with the ﬁlm. Figure 5 displays the full valence
band spectra of each ﬁlm presented in the main text. The
spectra are normalized to the O 2p states and oﬀset for
comparison.

The XAS was performed in total electron yield (TEY)
mode by measuring the sample drain current and was
normalized by the incoming beam current with a linearly
polarized beam. The photon energy axis was calibrated
using the Ti L2,3 and O K absorption edge features of a
rutile TiO2 single crystal. To achieve the desired align-
ment between the x-ray polarization and crystallographic
direction, the ﬁlms were rotated in both polar and az-
imuth. The spectra are normalized to the V L3 peak to
account for the intensity variations due to sample geom-
etry.

The samples were heated with a resistive heating el-
ement while monitoring the O K-edge for signatures of
the MIT, i.e. V–V dimers. Once the MIT was observed,
samples were heated an additional ∼20 ◦C above TMIT
to avoid phase coexistance. Figure 6 shows the polar-
ization dependent XAS for VO2(001), (100), and (110).
The spectra includes both the V L (presented in the main
text) and O K-edges. The O K-edge spectra presented
here show no evidence V–V dimers, consistent with the
rutile metallic phase.
