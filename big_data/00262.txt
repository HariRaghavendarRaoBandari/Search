ABSTRACT

Using a spectroscopically conﬁrmed sample of M-giants, M-dwarfs and quasars from the LAMOST
survey, we assess how well WISE & 2MASS color-cuts can be used to select M-giant stars. The WISE
bands are very eﬃcient at separating M-giants from M-dwarfs and we present a simple classiﬁcation
that can produce a clean and relatively complete sample of M-giants. We derive a new photometric
relation to estimate the metallicity for M-giants, calibrated using data from the APOGEE survey. We
ﬁnd a strong correlation between the (W 1 − W 2) color and [M/H], where almost all of the scatter
is due to photometric uncertainties. We show that previous photometric distance relations, which
are mostly based on stellar models, may be biased and devise a new empirical distance relation,
investigating trends with metallicity and star formation history. Given these relations, we investigate
the properties of M-giants in the Sagittarius stream. The oﬀset in the orbital plane between the
leading and trailing tails is reproduced and, by identifying distant M-giants in the direction of the
Galactic anti-center, we conﬁrm that the previously detected debris in the outer halo is the apocenter
of the trailing tail. We also ﬁnd tentative evidence supporting an existing overdensity near the leading
tail in the Northern Galactic hemisphere, possibly an extension to the trailing tail (so-called Branch
C). We have measured the metallicity distribution along the stream, ﬁnding a clear metallicity oﬀset
between the leading and trailing tails, in agreement with models for the stream formation. We include
an online table of M-giants to facilitate further studies.

INTRODUCTION

Standard ΛCDM cosmology predicts that the stellar
halo is formed by merger of smaller satellite systems.
This process would leave its imprint in a diﬀuse stellar
halo on a large scale. The density, luminosity, velocity,
and metallicity of the stellar halo can thus provide direct
constraints on the evolution history (e.g. Newberg et
al. 2002; Rocha-Pinto et al. 2004; Belokurov et al. 2006;
Newberg et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2009; Schlaufman et
al. 2012; Drake et al. 2013). Therefore detecting struc-
tures in the stellar halo of the Milky Way is particularly
important for understanding the evolution of our Galaxy.
M-giant stars, with temperatures in the range 2,400
to 3,700 K, are very bright; at the tip of the red giant
branch, their luminosities are ∼ 103 L(cid:12), making them
excellent tracers of substructures at large distances in
the outer Galactic halo (Majewski et al. 2003; Sharma et
al. 2010; Bochanski et al. 2014; Sheﬃeld et al. 2014, etc.).
However, only relatively metal-rich stellar populations in
the red giant branch (RGB) can extend to cool enough

temperatures to produce M-giants, making M-giants a
rare spectral type in the mostly metal-poor Galactic halo.
As M-giants are useful for tracing metal-rich struc-
tures, they are ideal for tracing the Sagittarius (Sgr)
stream. Since this stream is (relatively) metal-rich it
contains a signiﬁcant number of M-giants. Currently,
M-giants are mainly selected from multi-band photomet-
ric surveys as spectral identiﬁcation is only available for
small samples. From a Near Infra-Red (NIR) color-color
diagram of stars from 2MASS photometry catalog, Ma-
jewski et al. (2003), for the ﬁrst time, selected thousands
of M-giant candidates which were used to map the all-
sky view of the Sgr dwarf galaxy. Recently, Bochanski
et al. (2014) used a combined NIR and optical color se-
lection to assemble a catalog of 374 faint M-giant can-
didates from UKIDSS and SDSS. These candidates were
selected by position in the (J − H)0 vs (J − K)0 color-
color diagram for point sources in UKIDSS. This NIR
color-color selection is similar to that of Majewski et al.
(2003), but slightly shifted reward to reduce contami-
nation from bluer nearby M-dwarfs. They used a NIR-
optical (g − i)0 vs (i − K)0 color-color selection to iden-
tify quasar (QSO) contamination, removing nearly half
of their M-giant candidates. In order to further conﬁrm
those M-giants, they have begun high resolution spec-
troscopic follow-up observations. From their sixteen M-
giant candidates only 3 are conﬁrmed to be genuine M-
giants, which implies that the eﬃciency of selecting true
M-giants is only about ∼ 18%, although this is partially
a consequence of operating at faint magnitudes where
the fraction of M-giants to M-dwarfs drops dramatically.

Li et al.

During the preparation of this paper, Koposov et al.
(2015) showed that mid-IR photometry is more eﬀective
for classiﬁcation and used this technique to investigate
Sgr debris towards the Galactic anti-center.

It is clear that M-giant samples need to be enlarged,
not only with respect to the number of candidates, but
also in the sky coverage. The selection eﬃciency also
needs to be improved substantially. An important way
to test and improve photometric selection techniques
is through large spectroscopic surveys containing con-
ﬁrmed M-giant stars. One such survey is the LAM-
OST Experiment for Galactic Understanding and Ex-
ploration (LEGUE). The LAMOST telescope (Large sky
Area Multi-Object ﬁber Spectroscopic Telescope, also
known as the Guo Shou Jing Telescope) has been in full
survey mode since 2012 (Luo et al. 2015). From the
huge catalog of LAMOST spectra Zhong et al. (2015,
hereafter Z15; see also Zhong et al. 2015) constructed
M-giant templates and identiﬁed around 9,000 M-giant
stars, which is currently the largest spectroscopic catalog
of M-giants. This large spectroscopically-selected catalog
provides a mechanism with which we can explore more
eﬃcient multi-band photometric methods for separating
M-giants from the much more numerous M-dwarfs in the
Milky Way.

The paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy de-
scribes the LAMOST data we used in this work and the
spectroscopic M-giant/M-dwarf identiﬁcation.
In Sec-
tion 3 we recap previous methods for selecting M-giants
and introduce our new selection criteria based on IR pho-
tometry.
In Section 4 we analyze the properties these
M-giants, constructing photometric relations for estimat-
ing metallicities (4.1) and distances (4.2). In Section 5
we use our selection criteria to identify M-giants from
the all-sky ALLWISE database in order to study the Sgr
stream. We give our conclusions in Section 6.

2. LAMOST DATA AND SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION
In order to study the properties of M-giants, we ﬁrst
need to identify a large sample of such stars. We do this
using data from the LAMOST spectroscopic telescope
(Zhao et al. 2012). LAMOST is a large-aperture (4-5m)
spectroscopic survey telescope, operated by National As-
tronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
It has a total of 4,000 ﬁbers across a 20 sq. deg. ﬁeld-
of-view. Since 2012 the telescope has been carrying out
an extensive survey of stars in the Milky Way (Deng et
al. 2012), obtaining spectra for over 1 million stars each
year at a resolution of R ≈ 1, 800. In general, the input
catalog uses a selection method which is either random
or preferentially selects less populous regions of color-
magnitude space (Luo et al. 2015). DR1 was released to
the international community in 2015 (Luo et al. 2015).

The survey has been shown to be extremely useful for
obtaining large samples of red giant stars (notably the
sample of K-giants from Liu et al. 2014), but unfortu-
nately the LAMOST pipeline has diﬃculties with cool
M-type stars, in particular in the 2D spectral analysis
and ﬂux calibration (Luo et al. 2015). This leads to prob-
lems classifying late-type stars such as M-giants due to
the numerous molecular bands which aﬀect the morphol-
ogy of the spectra.

To circumvent these problems a separate analysis of
the M-type stars needs to be undertaken. For example,

Yi et al. (2014) applied a modiﬁcation of the Hammer
technique (Covey et al. 2007) to a set of spectra from
the LAMOST pilot survey, obtaining a sample of 67,000
M-dwarfs.

Another analysis has been carried out by Z15 and it
is this sample which we will use as a foundation for our
study. Z15 selected a large sample of M-giants and M-
dwarfs from LAMOST Data Release 1 (DR1) using a
template ﬁtting method to select M-type stars. They
ﬁnd over 100,000 spectra that show the characteristic
molecular titanium oxide (TiO), vanadium oxide (VO)
and calcium hydride (CaH) features typical of M-type
stars. They then take this sample and calculate the
TiO5, CaH2, and CaH3 spectral indices. The TiO and
CaH spectral indices were deﬁned by Reid, Hawley, &
Gizis (1995) and L´epine, Rich, & Shara (2007), and the
distribution of the spectral indices is a good indicator to
separate M-dwarf stars with diﬀerent metallicity (Gizis
1997; L´epine, Rich, & Shara 2003, 2007; L´epine et al.
2013; Mann et al. 2012). Figure 1 in Z15 shows the dis-
tribution of identiﬁed M-type stars in the TiO5 against
CaH2+CaH3 plot. The M-giants generally have weaker
CaH molecular bands for a given range of TiO5 values,
which is also consistent with the giant/dwarf discrimina-
tion of Mann et al. (2012). We note that the spectral in-
dices distribution of M-type stars can be used to separate
giants from dwarfs with little contamination, especially
for late-type M-giants.

The analysis of Z15 resulted in two catalogs, one con-
taining 8,639 M-giant candidates and one with around
100,000 M-dwarf candidates. It is these samples which
we use in the following study. We augment these with
a further catalog of 4,000 spectroscopically conﬁrmed
QSOs from LAMOST DR1, in order to assess QSO con-
tamination.

3. PHOTOMETRIC SELECTION OF M-GIANTS

3.1. WISE and 2MASS photometric data

With these relatively pure spectroscopically identiﬁed
M-giants, M-dwarfs and QSO candidates selected from
LAMOST DR1, we now attempt to ﬁnd an eﬀective se-
lection criteria for M-giants using near- and mid-IR pho-
tometry.

The Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is a
medium class space Explorer mission funded by NASA
and launched in December 2009. The WISE project
mapped the whole sky in four bands (W 1, W 2, W 3 and
W 4), centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 µm
(Wright et al. 2010).

We cross-matched our LAMOST sample of M giants,
M dwarfs and QSOs to the ALLWISE Source Catalog
in the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive, using a
search radius of 3(cid:48)(cid:48). More than 99% of the matched ob-
jects had LAMOST-WISE source separations less than
1(cid:48)(cid:48). We also applied the following cuts to ensure high
quality data: ccﬂags = 0000; extﬂg = 0; W1 sigmpro &
W2 sigmpro < 0.05, which means that the proﬁle-ﬁt pho-
tometric uncertainty is less than 0.05 mag; and ﬁnally
three cuts to ensure that we avoid saturated photome-
try, W1 sat & W2 sat < 0.05 (which means that the satu-
rated pixel fraction is less than 0.05), and W1 > 8.1 mag
(corresponding to the W1 saturation magnitude). After
applying these quality cuts, we are left with 4,136 M-

giants, 63,979 M-dwarfs, and 644 QSOs with both LAM-
OST and WISE & 2MASS data. The mean photometric
errors for our sample are: δJ = 0.023 mag, δK = 0.024
mag, δW 1 = 0.023 mag, and δW 2 = 0.021 mag.
Throughout we adopt the E(B − V ) maps of Schlegel
et al. (1998), in combination with Ar/E(B − V ) = 2.285
from Schlaﬂy et al. (2011) and Aλ/A(r) from Davenport
et al. (2014). This ﬁnal conversion has a weak depen-
dence on latitude (see Section 4.2 of their paper).
In
Appendix A we describe our implementation of this lati-
tude dependence. For illustrative purposes, in the follow-
ing ﬁgures we include an arrow denoting the reddening
vector. For this we choose b = 30 deg, which corresponds
to the value for high galactic latitudes. At high galactic
latitudes the orientation of the reddening vector is inde-
pendent of b; at smaller latitudes the dependence means
that in the E(J − K) vs E(W 1− W 2) plane the redden-
ing vector becomes closer to vertical as |b| approaches
0. The length of the reddening vector in these ﬁgures
corresponds to an extinction of AJ = 0.5 mag; this is
around an order-of-magnitude larger than typical values
at high latitudes, but underestimates the extinction at
low latitudes (i.e. |b| (cid:46) 10 deg) and towards the central
parts of the Galaxy.

3.2. Previous selection methods

In the past decades many studies have used M-giants to
trace substructures in the Milky way halo (e.g. Majewski
et al. 2003; Yanny et al. 2009; Rocha-Pinto et al. 2003;
Belokurov et al. 2014). One issue for these studies is the
problem of contamination from M-dwarfs, especially for
samples derived from photometry. In this subsection we
discuss previous methods which have been used to select
M-giants.

The simplest and most robust way to identify M-giants
is to use features in their spectra. In the optical band
the main diﬀerences between giants and dwarfs can be
seen in the morphology near the TiO band heads and
also the lack of strong Na I absorption at 8200 ˚A. In the
K band, giants possess signiﬁcantly stronger CO bands
than their dwarf counterparts (Bochanski et al. 2014).
Another method, also based on spectroscopy, is to use
the stellar parameters (such as eﬀective temperature and
surface gravity) to separate M-giants. An example of
this approach is shown in ﬁgure 4 and Equation (2) of
Belokurov et al. (2014), although in this example the
temperature range they have selected is more-commonly
associated to K-type stars. This was a deliberate deci-
sion due to issues with the reliability of the spectroscopic
temperature estimation for M-type stars (V. Belokurov,
private communication). As we will show later in Section
3.3, 2MASS colors can be used to diﬀerentiate spectral
class. The colors of stars from the Belokurov et al. se-
lection (0.7 (cid:46) (J − K)0 (cid:46) 0.9 mag) are consistent with
early-type M-giants, although some may be late-type K-
giants. Clearly the eﬃcacy of this method relies on the
accuracy of the measurements of temperature and grav-
ity.

The above two methods both rely on spectroscopic
data, but to eﬃciently map wide areas (and large vol-
umes) it is often better to use photometric surveys. This
can be done using optical data (e.g. Yanny et al. 2009),
although better results have been achieved using NIR
data, such as 2MASS (Majewski et al. 2003; Sharma et

Figure 1. 2MASS (J−K)0 vs (J−H)0 color-color distribution for
spectroscopically classiﬁed M-giants (blue contours), M-dwarfs (red
contours) and QSOs (green triangles). The contours correspond to
1- and 2-σ, i.e. contain 68.3% and 95.4% of the data), the. The

selection criteria.
al. 2010; Bochanski et al. 2014, e.g.). Figure 1 shows the
2MASS color-color diagram for our sample of M-giants,
M-dwarfs and QSOs identiﬁed from LAMOST (see Sec-
tion 2). The blue contours show the distribution of M-
giants (corresponding to 1- and 2-σ, i.e. containing 68.3%
and 95.4% of the data), the red contours M-dwarfs, and
the green triangles QSOs. The black arrow shows an
example reddening vector (see Section 3.1 for further de-
tails).

The stellar locus is clearly deﬁned in this ﬁgure, but
there is no obvious division between M-giants and M-
dwarfs. Although the QSOs are oﬀset from the stars,
there is also signiﬁcant overlap.
In Majewski et al.
(2003), they used (J − K)0 > 0.85 to remove M-dwarf
contamination and the black box in Figure 1 shows their
ﬁnal selection region. Although these color cuts remove
many of the M-dwarf and QSO contaminants, there are
clearly still a signiﬁcant number of M-dwarfs present
in this region.
In Bochanski et al. (2014), they used
a similar selection region, applying a stricter color cut
of (J − K)0 > 1.02 to remove more M-dwarf contam-
ination. This indeed removes more of the M-dwarfs,
but at a cost of removing many genuine M-giants with
(J − K)0 < 1.02. After applying the Bochanski et al.
(2014) color cuts to our spectroscopically classiﬁed sam-
ple, we ﬁnd that these 2MASS-selected M-giant candi-
dates still have 13.5% dwarf contamination and many
M-giants have been sacriﬁced (the M-giant completeness
is only 48.7%). Although these percentages will depend
on the magnitude range under consideration and the un-
derlying LAMOST selection-function, they give an in-
dication of the problems faced by these techniques. In
short, by using NIR data it is not possible to entirely re-
move M-dwarf contamination and simultaneously ensure
reasonable levels of M-giant completeness.

3.3. 2MASS & WISE selection criteria

A better way to identify M-giants is to use mid-IR
data, such as that available from the WISE mission. A
combined 2MASS and WISE color-color diagram for M-
giants, M-dwarfs and QSOs is shown in Figure 2, where
the data used here are same as in Figure 1.
The separation of QSOs from stars is substantially im-
proved, with the former having much redder (W1 −W2 )0
color. As before the separation is not perfect and a few
QSOs appear to lie amid the stellar locus, particularly

color distribution for spectroscopically classiﬁed M-giants (blue
contours), M-dwarfs (red contours) and QSOs (green triangles).
The contours corresponding to 1- and 2-σ. The black arrow shows
an example reddening vector (see Section 3.1 for further details).
There are a small number of M-giant located in the M-dwarf re-
gion, but these are most likely mis-classiﬁed due to having low S/N
spectra (see Section 3.3.

around (J − K)0 ≈ 0.5. Although most of these are low
S/N spectra (almost all have S/N < 10) and hence are
probably mis-classiﬁed, around 20% or more appear to
be binary stars composed of an M-dwarf around a hotter
companion.
From this ﬁgure one can also see that the (J − K)0 vs
(W1 − W2 )0 color-color plane enables a relatively clean
separation of M-giants from M-dwarfs, much more eﬃ-
ciently than NIR data alone. There appears to be a small
number of M-giants located in M-dwarf region, but these
are actually misidentiﬁed M-giants. For low S/N spectra
the dwarf/giant spectroscopic classiﬁcation breaks down
and it becomes increasingly diﬃcult to separate the two
populations.
If we remove stars with low S/N spectra
(i.e. S/N < 5), then these spurious objects almost all
disappear.

One issue that is not dealt with in Figure 2 is the prop-
erties of cooler stars, such as K-dwarfs/giants. To ad-
dress this we have supplemented our data with a sample
of LAMOST K-type stars from Liu et al. (2014), which
have been classiﬁed using spectral line features. The dis-
tributions in the (J − K)0 vs (W1 − W2 )0 plane are
shown in Figure 3. There is an overlap between late-
K and early-M giants, which is not surprising and most
likely due to the Liu et al. sample including a number of
early M-giants, but reassuringly there is very little over-
lap between K-dwarfs and M-giants. This implies that a
2MASS-WISE color selection should be free from signif-
icant dwarf contamination.

Given these ﬁndings, we now deﬁne the following se-

lection region for M-giants,

− 0.23 < (W1 − W2 )0 < 0.02,
0.85 < (J − K)0 < 1.3,
(J − K)0 > 1.45 × (W1 − W2 )0 + 1.05.

(1)

This has been chosen to minimize contamination while
retaining a reasonable level of completeness. Assum-
ing the spectroscopic classiﬁcations are reliable, we ﬁnd
that there is only 4.9% contamination from dwarfs in
the color-box given in Equation (1). Furthermore, we
believe that most of this contamination is likely due to
misclassiﬁed spectra; if we remove all spectra with S/N
less than 10, then the contamination from dwarfs drops
to less than 1%.

Figure 3. 2MASS and WISE (J − K)0 vs (W 1 − W 2)0 color-
color distribution for spectroscopically classiﬁed M-giants (blue),
M-dwarfs (red), K-giants (purple) and K-dwarfs (green). Contours
correspond to 1- and 2-σ. The dashed box shows our M-giants
selection criteria. The black arrow shows an example reddening
vector (see Section 3.1 for further details).

Any discussion of contamination and completeness will
depend on the details of the selection-function (e.g. the
presence of color-biases), the sky coverage and the mag-
nitude range under consideration, with brighter mag-
nitudes containing a higher M-giant/M-dwarf fraction.
This is because at bright magnitudes the volume probed
by M-dwarfs is small and at faint magnitudes the num-
ber of M-giants drops because there are so few at large
distances in the halo. For reference, the magnitude range
probed by our sample is 7.63 (cid:46) J0 (cid:46) 15.52.

A similar approach was adopted by Koposov et al.
(2015), although they chose a narrower selection region in
the (J − K)0 vs (W 1− W 2)0 color-color plane (see equa-
tion 1 of their paper). The performance of their selection
is comparable to ours; their completeness is around 10
per cent lower due to the narrower selection, and their
contamination, while still below 5 per cent, is slightly
higher than ours since their selection is closer to the M-
dwarf region.

4. PROPERTIES OF M-GIANTS

4.1. Metallicity estimation

In Figure 3 we can see that most M-giants are located
in the region (W1 − W2 )0 < −0.1, but there is an exten-
sion to redder (W1 − W2 )0 colors. After checking the
location of the stars which populate this extended region
we ﬁnd that most of them are at high galactic latitudes,

indicating that they are likely to be more metal-poor.
This WISE metallicity trend is also predicted by stellar
models, as can been seen (for example) in ﬁgure 1 of
Koposov et al. (2015).

To go one step further, we compare the photometry
of our M-giants to the spectroscopic metallicity obtained
using data from the SDSS project APOGEE (Holtzman
et al. 2015). This survey is taking high S/N and high-
resolution (R = 22,500) NIR spectra, resulting in de-
tailed chemistry and a measurement of [M/H] to a pre-
cision of better than 0.1 dex. We cross-match APOGEE
DR12 with WISE and 2MASS, using the same photo-
metric quality cuts as described in Section 3.1 with an
additional cut of |b| > 30 deg, and then use our photo-
metric criteria to select a sample of M-giants. Figure 4
shows the APOGEE metallicities of the resulting sample
of 296 M-giants as a function of (W 1 − W 2) color. The
correlation with (W1 − W2 )0 is very strong and can be
ﬁt with the following linear relation:
[M/H]phot = −13.2+0.5−0.6 × (W1 − W2 )0 − 2.28+0.06−0.07 dex,
(2)
taking into account errors on both color and metallicity
(Hogg et al. 2010).

As can be seen from the inset of Figure 4, the resid-
ual scatter about this linear relation is small (0.29 dex).
What is most remarkable about this is that the spread
is almost entirely due to photometric uncertainties. The
mean photometric error on (W1 −W2 )0 for these stars is
0.031 mag, which is larger than the measured spread in
(W1 − W2 )0 about the linear relation (0.022 mag). This
implies that the photometric uncertainties are probably
overestimated and, in any case, the intrinsic dispersion
in this relation must be exceptionally small.
If we at-
tempt to ﬁt the relation including a term to represent
the intrinsic spread (Equation 35 of Hogg et al. 2010) we
ﬁnd, as expected, that the best-ﬁt spread is zero.

It should be noted that the APOGEE parameter
pipeline encounters diﬃculties for very cool giants, with
a recommendation that metallicities for stars cooler than
4000K should be treated with caution (Holtzman et al.
2015). Around a third of our cross-matched sample are
cooler than this limit, and so to check the eﬀect on our
relation we repeat the ﬁt excluding these stars. The re-
sulting relation is very similar, although slightly steeper,
[M/H]phot = −15.6+0.4−0.2 × (W1 − W2 )0 − 2.58+0.06−0.04 dex.
(3)
Throughout the paper we adopt the original relation
(Equation 2) and label these metallicities [M/H]phot.
Clearly (W1 − W2 )0 is a very good proxy for [M/H],
meaning that this can be used to quantify metallicities of
halo substructures (as we will demonstrate later in Sec-
tion 5). Similar work has been carried out by Schlaufman
& Casey (2014), ﬁnding that WISE photometry can ef-
ﬁciently identify metal-poor stars.

In Figure 5 we show the distribution of M-giants on
the sky, using our M-giant selection from Equation (1)
and photometric quality cuts as described in Section 3.1.
We add a further cut of J0 > 12, to ensure that our stars
are beyond ∼ 10 kpc, and 10.5 < W 10 < 13.5, which is
optimal for detecting the Sgr stream. Using our photo-
metric metallicity [M/H]phot, we show two distributions
in this ﬁgure:
in the top panel we show all M-giants,

Figure 4. The metallicity distribution of APOGEE M-giants vs
(W1 − W2 )0 color. The red line shows the best-ﬁt linear relation-
ship. The inset histogram shows the scatter in metallicity about
this relation, which has a dispersion of 0.29 dex. Note that the
mean error in [M/H]APOGEE is 0.03 dex and the mean error in
(W1 − W2 )0 is 0.03 mag, which implies that the intrinsic scatter
in this relation is exceptionally small (see Section 4.1).

while in the bottom we show the more metal-poor ones
(by removing stars with (W1 − W2 )0 < −0.13, corre-
sponding to [M/H]phot > −0.56 dex). As can be seen
from the lower panel, this cut reduces the amount of disc
M-giants in the sample and also removes some relatively
metal-rich substructures in the halo, such as the Tri-And
system located at RA ∼ 30 deg, Dec ∼ 30 deg (Majew-
ski et al. 2004; Rocha-Pinto et al. 2004; see, for example,
Figure 7 of Deason et al. 2014 for a plot of the metal-
licity distribution).

4.2. Distance estimation

4.2.1. An empirical distance relation

In Figure 5, we can see the Sgr stream, LMC and SMC
very clearly. We can use these structures to estimate an
M-giant color-absolute-magnitude relation, since we al-
ready know their distances. To do this we ﬁrst calculate
the absolute magnitude (MJ ) for each M-giant in these
regions using distance estimates from the literature, as-
suming that all stars lie at the systemic distance of the
structure.
We select four regions from the upper panel of Fig-
ure 5: a region near the core6 of Sgr (285◦ < α <
300◦, −35◦ < δ < −28◦; hereafter called Sgr core re-
gion); one near the apocenter of the leading tail of Sgr
(214◦ < α < 226◦,−10◦ < δ < 0◦); an LMC region
(60◦ < α < 105◦,−78◦ < δ < −60◦); and an SMC region
(5◦ < α < 25◦,−77◦ < δ < −70◦). The distances we
adopted for the LMC, SMC, Sgr core and Sgr leading
apocenter are 51 kpc (Keller & Wood 2006; de Grijs et
al. 2014), 61 kpc Keller & Wood (2006), 29 kpc (calcu-
lated using the model of Law & Majewski 2010), and 53
kpc (Belokurov et al. 2014), respectively.

6 We have not included the actual Sgr core in order to avoid
low-latitude regions where extinction and crowding could aﬀect
our analysis.

also removes some relatively metal-rich substructures in the halo, such as the Tri-And system located at RA ∼ 30 deg, Dec ∼ 30 deg (see
Section 4.1).

Figure 6 shows MJ vs (J − K)0 relations in our four
regions. As has been seen by many authors (e.g. Sharma
et al. 2010), the absolute magnitude for M-giants varies
approximately linearly with (J − K)0 color. However,
it is not precisely linear, so we choose to ﬁt these data
using the following power-law relation,
0 − 1

(4)
where A3 corresponds to the value of MJ at (J−K)0 = 1
mag. We do this by slicing the data into MJ segments
and ﬁtting each of these with two Gaussians (one for
the system and one for the background). We then ﬁt
the centroids of the former Gaussians with the above
polynomial relation.

the range 0.9 – 1.1 mag.

We start with the Sgr core region, which covers the
largest magnitude range (owing to the fact that it is the
closest of the three structures). The parameters are pre-
sented in Table 1 and should be valid for the color range
that we probe, i.e. 0.9 (cid:46) (J − K)0 (cid:46) 1.1. The inset in
the ﬁrst panel of Figure 6 shows the scatter around the
MJ,ﬁt relationship. The dispersion is 0.36 mag, which
corresponds to a distance uncertainty of 20%. Note that
this uncertainty doesn’t take into account population ef-
fects (which we discuss next) and so this estimate can be
considered as a lower-limit on the actual uncertainty.

In the second panel of Figure 6 we compare the Sgr core
ﬁt to data from the leading tail’s apocenter, ﬁnding very
good agreement. The ﬁnal two panels of this ﬁgure show
the derived relation for the LMC and SMC, where we
have kept parameters A1 and A2 ﬁxed to match the Sgr
core values. As expected the color-absolute-magnitude
relation varies between Sgr and the LMC and SMC, ow-
ing to the diﬀerent metallicities and star-formation his-
tories of these systems. Figure 7 shows the metallic-
ity distribution function (MDF) in these four regions,
using the photometric metallicity relation presented in
Equation (2). It is interesting to note that although the
MDF for the Sgr core and SMC are quite similar, their
MJ,ﬁt relations vary signiﬁcantly. In fact, despite having
a signiﬁcant shift in mean metallicity compared to Sgr
core, the LMC has a much better agreement in terms of
MJ,ﬁt. These discrepancies are likely caused by the dif-
ferent star-formation histories in these systems. This can
also be seen when one considers the diﬀerence between
the Sgr core and leading apocenter regions, which have
very similar MJ,ﬁt relations yet clearly discrepant MDFs.
This is most likely a consequence of the fact that the
leading apocenter material is composed of stars stripped
from the outer parts of the infalling dwarf, while the core
material is from the younger populations in the center.
So the shift in MJ,ﬁt from the MDF oﬀset is probably
canceled by a corresponding shift coming from the age
oﬀset. We return to the issue of Sgr in Section 5.

We performed the following simple test to check
whether internal extinction in these systems is likely to
be aﬀecting our derived MJ,ﬁt relations. We took two
LMC samples, one consisting of the entire LMC region
(60◦ < α < 105◦, −78◦ < δ < −60◦) and one cov-
ering the same area but excluding the central region
(70◦ < α < 90◦, −72◦ < δ < −68◦) where internal
extinction will be most signiﬁcant. We then performed
the same MJ,ﬁt ﬁtting to these two regions and found
that there was no clear shift in the relations, conﬁrming

Figure 7. Photometric [Fe/H] distribution in Sgr core, Sgr apoc-
enter, LMC and SMC region, as derived from Equation (2).
that internal extinction is unlikely to bias our results.

In Figure 8 we compare our MJ,ﬁt relation to some of
those in the literature. The two main references we use
are Sharma et al. (2010) and Sheﬃeld et al. (2014). The
former paper uses a single linear relation calibrated to
match a range of stellar models with ages and metallic-
ities consistent with simulated stellar halos (Bullock &
Johnston 2005). Sheﬃeld et al. (2014) generalized this
to include a metallicity dependence, again using stellar
models. For completeness we also include the relation
from Covey et al. (2007), which the authors admit is not
especially robust (this relation is itself based on Pickles
1998, who use solar-age and solar-abundance stellar mod-
els). Note that our method diﬀers from these in that it is
an empirical relation, rather than relying on stellar mod-
els. We can see that our three relations (Sgr, LMC and
SMC) are consistent with the [Fe/H] = 0 relation from
Sheﬃeld et al. (2014), even though these three systems
are all more metal-poor than this value. In particular our
Sgr relation, which provides a good match to the leading
apocenter where [Fe/H] (cid:46) −1, is oﬀset from Sheﬃeld et
al.’s [Fe/H] = −1 relation by around 1 mag. As discussed
above, this is may be due to the age dependence of these
relations. We conclude that a simple relation based on
metallicity might overlook some subtleties and hence not
be ideal for all purposes.

metal-rich population is bluer than the metal-poor one.
The contrasting behavior for the LMC and Sgr can be
understood when one considers the diﬀerence between
the star formation histories of these two systems. We
know that the LMC retains gas and has an extended
star formation history. As a consequence, the metal-rich
populations are likely to be signiﬁcantly younger than
the metal-poor ones, which can lead to the MJ depen-
dence on metallicity to be canceled out. This is because
the red giant branch for younger populations is generally
bluer than older populations. However, the star forma-
tion history of Sgr is likely to be less extended than the
LMC, as its infall into the Milky Way will have removed
most of the gas and truncated star formation (see, for
example, de Boer et al. 2015).

4.2.3. Test case: The tilt of the LMC

Although the distance uncertainty for an individual M-
giant is relatively large (around 20% before considering
population eﬀects), for structures like the LMC we can
average large numbers of stars to determine the distance
to relatively high precision. We therefore test the per-
formance of our relation by addressing the tilt in the
LMC disc, which has been established by previous au-
thors (e.g. Subramanian & Subramaniam 2013, and ref-
erences therein).

We do this by calculating MJ for each of the stars,
assuming a distance of 51 kpc, and compare the distri-
bution of magnitudes to the ﬁducial relation calculated
above (see Table 1). The tilt means that stars on the
near-side will be on-average brighter, while those on the
far-side will be on-average fainter. Since we expect such
variations to be correlated with azimuth, we divide up
the data into eight segments as shown in the right panel
of Figure 10. The central regions will exhibit negligi-
ble tilt, so we exclude these using an ellipse with major
axis of 10 deg and minor axis of 4 deg, centered on (α,
δ)=(83◦, −69◦). The left and middle panels show the
color-absolute-magnitude relation for two of these seg-
ments, compared to the ﬁducial relation. There are clear
magnitude oﬀsets in some of these regions, with Seg-
ment 2 (middle panel) hosting stars that are on-average
brighter than the ﬁducial relation, while Segment 5 (left
panel) shows the opposite behavior. To quantify this
discrepancy, we calculate the mean oﬀset from the ﬁdu-
cial relation for each numbered segment by ﬁtting the
distribution with a Gaussian function. The results are
presented in Table 2. From this we can see that the oﬀ-
sets exhibits a clear sinusoidal behavior with azimuth,
as expected if the LMC is tilted to our line-of-sight. By
ﬁtting a sine curve to these oﬀsets (excluding Segment 7
which has an unusually broad M-giant branch and does
not match the overall trend), we ﬁnd that the position
angle of the line of nodes is 128.5◦, where the angle is
measured Eastwards from the North. This compares fa-
vorably to Subramanian & Subramaniam (2013), who
found an angle of 141.5◦.

We can also investigate the inclination angle, but this
is slightly harder to measure as it is also a function of
the distance of the stars from the center of the LMC. The
amplitude of the oﬀsets in Table 2 is around 0.11 mag and
the separation of these stars is around 10 deg from the
center of the LMC. This corresponds to an inclination of
around 16 deg, which is not too dissimilar to the value of

Figure 8. Comparison of our empirical distance relation to var-
ious literature sources. The red lines correspond to our new rela-
tions, where the top, middle and bottom lines correspond to rela-
tions based on the SMC, LMC and Sgr, respectively. Our relations
are only valid for the range 0.9 (cid:46) (J −K)0 (cid:46) 1.1, while the Sharma
et al. and Sheﬃeld et al. ones are valid for 0.97 (cid:46) (J − K)0 (cid:46) 1.2.

The location of the red giant branch in color-magnitude
space is well-known to be dependent on both age and
metallicity. Given the metallicity relation found in the
previous section, the question naturally arises whether
we can detect metallicity gradients within our distance
relation.

We ﬁrst test the core region of Sgr, where we have
the most coverage of the color-magnitude plane. We re-
peat the same procedure as above, assuming all stars lie
at a distance of 29 kpc, but for two samples: one with
metallicity around 0.5 dex greater than the mean and
one around 0.5 dex smaller (−0.42 < [M/H] < 0.00 dex
and −1.50 < [M/H] < −1.12 dex, respectively, where
the mean photometric metallicity is −0.76 dex). In or-
der to clean the sample, in each band we reject the stars
with 10% largest photometric errors. The two samples
have around 250 stars each.
The resulting distributions of MJ vs (J − K)0 are
shown in Figure 9. The ﬁducial relation derived for
the whole population (Section 4.2.1) is shown by the
solid red line. As can be seen, especially for the region
0.95 < (J − K)0 < 1.10 mag, there is a systematic shift
with the metal-rich population lying below the relation
and metal-poor one above. This matches the expectation
from stellar models, where for a given age metal-poor
populations are bluer. The dashed lines in this Figure
correspond to the ﬁducial relation shifted vertically by
±0.2 and ±0.4 mag, which means that the shift with
metallicity for Sgr is around 0.3 to 0.6 mag.dex
It can also be seen that the metal-rich population ex-
tends to smaller (J − K)0 colors. This is due to our diag-
onal color-cut, which means that at redder (W 1 − W 2)0
colors the M-giant selection box does not extend as far
in (J − K)0 (see Figure 3).
We repeat this exercise for the LMC, where we have
the largest number of M-giants. We again reject lower-
quality photometry, this time removing the stars with
20% largest photometric errors in each band. Our two
metallicity ranges were again chosen to be 0.5 dex above
and below the mean value (−0.20 < [M/H] < −0.05 dex
and −1.20 < [M/H] < −1.07 dex, respectively, where
the mean photometric metallicity is −0.63 dex). Each
sample has around 2,500 stars.

The resulting distributions, shown in Figure 9, are sig-

trend with metallicity and one might even claim that the

5. MAPPING THE SAGITTARIUS STREAM

In Figure 5 we have shown the distribution of M-
giants across the entire sky. The most prominent fea-

tures in this ﬁgure are the LMC and SMC (located in
the bottom-right corner of each panel), but in addi-
tion the Sgr stream is clearly visible, extending from
the core of the dwarf galaxy located behind the Galac-
tic bulge (lying at RA = 284 deg and Dec = −30 deg).
This map is qualitatively similar to that obtained from
2MASS M-giants (Majewski et al. 2003), but as we have
shown above our version will have less M-dwarf contam-
ination.7 There are further stream-like detections (e.g.
at RA, Dec = 180,−10 deg or 90,−20 deg), but these are
most-likely artifacts due to the WISE scanning law. We
present a table of all M-giants from this map in Appendix
B.

5.1. Distances to the stream

Given the relations obtained in the previous section,
we now proceed to analyze the distribution of Sgr M-
giants. We start oﬀ by looking at the heliocentric dis-
tances to the stream. This is shown in the bottom panel
of Figure 11, where we have plotted all M-giants obtained
using the selection criteria deﬁned in Equation (1) but
restricted ourselves to only those stars which lie within
10 deg of the Sgr orbital plane (deﬁned following the
equations in the Appendix of Belokurov et al. 2014; note
that this coordinate system is related to the Majewski et
al. 2003 system through ˜Λ = 360− Λ and ˜B = −B). Dis-
tances have been calculated using the Sgr relation given
in Section 4.2. Background subtraction has been per-
formed by averaging two ﬁelds at 10 < ˜B < 20 deg and
−20 < ˜B < −10 deg. We have omitted the two regions
closest to the bulge (˜Λ < 40 deg and ˜Λ > 320 deg) as
confusion means it is diﬃcult to reliably identify the Sgr
stream.

This plot clearly shows the leading stream reaching
apocenter at around 50 – 60 kpc at ˜Λ = 50 – 60 deg, and

7 Our map is very similar to that of Koposov et al. (2015, right
panel of Figure 2), owing to the fact that our 2MASS & WISE
selection cuts are similar to theirs (see Section 3.3).

ment between the existing trailing debris and the pro-
posed apocenter detection. Making a detection of this
connecting material is diﬃcult due to the fact that at this
point the stream passes through the disc in the Galactic
anti-center. However, given the purity of the giant sam-
ple from our WISE selection, we are also able to support
the hypothesis that the distant detection is the apocen-
ter of the trailing tail. Although the WISE data is not
deep enough to reach the apocenter itself, in the lower
panel of Figure 11 we clearly detect a bridge of stars
connecting the well-studied trailing material at ˜Λ > 210
deg with the apocenter detection at ˜Λ < 190 deg. If one
takes all M-giants in this region (180 < ˜Λ < 210 deg and
55 < Dhelio < 80 kpc), there is an overdensity around
the plane of the stream (with ˜B ∼ 5 deg).

Belokurov et al. (2014) also argued that the trailing
stream may extend even further, connecting to an over-
density located around ˜Λ ∼ 110 deg (which is sometimes
referred to as Branch C; see Belokurov et al. 2006, Cor-
renti et al. 2010). We also ﬁnd a tentative detection of
this overdensity (with around 10–15 M-giants; this is the
weak spur at ˜Λ = 115 deg and at a distance of 45 kpc in
Figure 11), implying that its existence is robust as it has
been detected in samples of subgiants, red clump stars
and now M-giants. It is indeed clustered around the Sgr
orbital plane, but appears to be relatively broad (with
−15 (cid:46) ˜B (cid:46) 5 deg). One may expect the stream to be
more diﬀuse this far from the core. However, until one
can detect material connecting Branch C to the apocen-
ter detection (which is not evident in our data), then its
nature remains up for debate.

5.2. Orbital plane

In the middle panel of Figure 11 we have plotted the
distribution of Sgr stream stars on the sky, rotated into
the Sgr coordinate system (Belokurov et al. 2014).
In
this system Sgr lies at (0,0) and its orbit moves in the
direction of increasing ˜Λ. To construct this ﬁgure we
have only included M-giants within 10 kpc of the stream
(as given by the black lines in the lower panel, where
we have linearly extrapolated for the regions with no de-
tections). We have also incorporated a background sub-
traction, averaging two regions either side of this range
(i.e. 20 (cid:46) ˜B (cid:46) 30 deg and −30 (cid:46) ˜B (cid:46) −20 deg) and
interpolating between them.
As mentioned above, it is diﬃcult to determine the be-
havior towards the anti-center (˜Λ ∼ 180 deg), but apart
from that the stream is clearly detected and lies close to
the adopted stream plane (i.e. ˜B = 0). We have ﬁt the
cross-stream proﬁle with a Gaussian model in order to
trace the centroid of the density distribution and this is
shown by the two solid lines. The trailing tail lies almost
precisely on the orbital plane. The leading stream, how-
ever, shows clear deviation from the plane and crosses at
a shallow angle. This oﬀset between the orbital planes
of the leading and trailing tails is not new; for example
Johnston et al.
(2005) did this with 2MASS M-giants,
ﬁnding an oﬀset of around 5–10 degrees in the orientation

out by Newby et al. (2013) and Belokurov et al. (2014).
In order to interpret this plot, we now compare this
to the behavior of main-sequence turn-oﬀ (MSTO) stars

In this system the Sgr dwarf is located at (0,0) and its orbit moves

have distances within 10 kpc of the stream. The centroid of the

the trailing stream at ˜Λ > 220 deg. We see good agree-
ment with literature distances (shown by the solid black
lines in this panel; taken from Belokurov et al. 2014),
although there is a possible discrepancy in the gradi-
ent for the leading debris around ˜Λ (cid:38) 100 deg, which
may be due to population eﬀects aﬀecting our distance
relation. This may occur if the material more-distant
from the core is more metal-poor or older, having been
stripped earlier. We return to the issue of metallicities
later in this Section.
It is worthwhile to note that al-
though these literature distances come from a variety of
tracers (blue horizontal branch stars, red clump stars,
subgiant branch stars and now M-giants), the agreement
is remarkably consistent.

There has been recent controversy over the potential
detection of the apocenter of the trailing tail of the Sgr
stream by Belokurov et al. (2014), based on BHBs and
kinematics of giant stars in SDSS (see also Newberg et
al. 2003 and Drake et al. 2013). This detection is shown
with the distant black line in the bottom panel of Fig-
ure 11. Recent evidence to support this claim comes
from Koposov et al. (2015), where they take velocities of
M-giants around ˜Λ ∼ 200–230 deg and ﬁnd good agree-

in this region. Many authors have looked at the dis-
tribution of MSTO stars and we have included a map
of MSTO density in the top panel of Figure 11 (taken8
from Koposov et al. 2012). The MSTO stars exhibit the
well known ‘bifurcation’ in the leading stream, splitting
into two separate branches bisected by ˜B = 0 with the
faint companion stream at ˜B ∼ 2 deg. Koposov et al.
(2012) also detect a bifurcation in MSTO stars in the
trailing stream, with the bifurcation being harder to de-
tect and consisting of a faint wing to the distribution
(around −15 < ˜B < 5 deg; see also Slater et al. 2013).
Our distributions (also shown by the solid lines in the
top panel) show good agreement with the bright MSTO
stream in both the leading and trailing tails, but with no
evidence for a bifurcation. The location where the bifur-
cation is clearest in MSTO stars is around 100 < ˜Λ < 160
deg, but here the density of M-giants is low and so it
is hard to detect even the bright stream. Therefore
this non-detection may be because there are insuﬃcient
stars to sample the faint secondary stream, or this may
be due to physical diﬀerences between the two streams.
There are two main hypotheses for the origin of the faint
stream: either this is material from an earlier wrap of the
stream (e.g. de Boer et al. 2015), or this is from a smaller
companion system to the main progenitor (e.g. Koposov
et al. 2012). Both of these scenarios are consistent with
our non-detection of the faint stream, if one argues that
the faint stream should posses fewer M-giants as it is
older and more metal-poor than the bright stream (be-
cause the faint stream contains material stripped from
the outer parts of the progenitor where there is less
metal-enrichment, or because it is simply from a smaller
system with less metal-enrichment). One ﬁnal point to
note is that Koposov et al. (2012) claimed to detect
a bifurcation in the distribution of 2MASS-selected M-
giants in the trailing tail, with the faint stream lying at
5 < ˜B < 10 deg for 240 < ˜Λ < 270 deg. We however are
unable to conﬁrm this with our WISE-selected sample.
Our detection shows very good agreement with the
bright stream, although the leading tail appears to be
misaligned by a couple of degrees. This could be due
to statistical ﬂuctuations, especially if a few M-giants
from the faint stream were biasing the centroid ﬁts. The
other explanation is that this oﬀset is due to population
eﬀects, as one would not necessarily expect that the M-
giants and MSTO stars to share the same radial proﬁle
in the progenitor system. Rather we expect that the
M-giants, which are rare in halo populations, should be
more tightly bound and centrally concentrated than the
MSTO stars, and this may lead to the two populations
being stripped diﬀerently and hence not lying on iden-
tical orbital planes. We defer a detailed analysis of the
alignment of the orbital planes to a further study. An in-
depth discussion of the alignment and precession of the
stream has been presented in Belokurov et al. (2014),
which compares the orbital plane of the MSTO and red
clump stars to that of the M-giants as measured by John-
ston et al.
(2005). They also ﬁnd that the M-giants lie
close to the plane of the bright stream, with the orbital
poles being a few degrees oﬀset for the leading stream

Koposov et al. (2012), as the B axis has the wrong sign. See Figure

and almost identical for the trailing stream.

5.3. Metallicity gradient

In Section 4.1 we demonstrated that the WISE W1
and W2 bands provide a very good measure of an M-
giant’s metallicity. Given this fact, we now investigate
the metallicity gradient in the stream. Previous attempts
to do so have been published, but are usually limited
to small sample sizes or are drawn from inhomogeneous
populations (e.g. Chou et al. 2007; Monaco et al. 2007;
Chou et al. 2010; Keller et al.
2010). Using our pho-
tometric relation, we are able to estimate metallicities
for a large number of stars, all belonging to the same
population (i.e. M-giants).

We have measured the metallicity distribution at two
locations along the stream, as shown in Figure 12. Here
we have restricted ourselves to only plotting stars with
−10 < ˜B < 10 deg and (as in the previous subsection)
those whose distances are within 10 kpc of the stream.
Although our photometric metallicity relation is valid
over a large range (−1.5 (cid:46) [Fe/H] (cid:46) 0 dex), values be-
yond this should be treated with caution; this is because
our linear relation is based on APOGEE data which only
covers −1.5 (cid:46) [Fe/H] (cid:46) 0 dex, and so values beyond this
are based on extrapolations. As discussed in Section 4.1,
the uncertainty in this relation is 0.22 dex.

From Figure 12 we can see a clear oﬀset between the
two streams, with the leading stream being more metal-
poor. This is in good agreement with the result in
Monaco et al. (2007, see their Figure 7), albeit with an
order of magnitude more stars. Our measurement of the
trailing tail metallicity is also in good agreement with
that derived from main-sequence turn-oﬀ stars in Car-
lin et al. (2012). The mean and standard deviation of
our distributions are (−1.00, 0.28) and (−0.80, 0.20) dex
for the leading and trailing streams, respectively. Since
the uncertainty in the photometric metallicity relation is
around 0.2 dex, the small dispersions indicate that there
is very little intrinsic spread in the M-giant metallicity
for each tail, especially for the trailing tail. Note that we
were unable to ﬁnd any signiﬁcant gradients within the
leading or trailing streams, probably due to the lack of
precision in the metallicity measurements.

Such an oﬀset between the two streams can be ex-
plained by internal metallicity gradients in the progeni-
tor dwarf. If the outer-regions are more metal-poor, then
the fact that these will be stripped earlier than the inner
regions sets up a metallicity gradient along the stream.
Although our leading and trailing metallicity distribu-
tions are both measured around 100 deg from the core,
they actually correspond to material stripped at diﬀerent
times. By analyzing the Sgr disruption history from the
model of Law & Majewski (2010), we ﬁnd that our trail-
ing material is predicted to consist of debris stripped dur-
ing the most-recent pericentric passage, while our leading
material includes debris stripped from the last two peri-
centric passages (see Fig. 17 of Law & Majewski 2010).
This naturally leads to the observed oﬀset in metallicity
(and also explains the narrower dispersion in metallicity
for the trailing tail), from which we can conclude that
the progenitor dwarf must have been massive enough to
support internal metallicity gradients.

One may wonder whether our distributions are aﬀected

tion 2), with a scatter of 0.35 dex. The most remark-
able aspect of this is that the scatter in (W1 − W2 )0 is
comparable to the observational error in the photome-
try, implying that the intrinsic dispersion in this relation
must be exceptionally small. This means that it is pos-
sible to quickly amass large samples of M-giants which
are (a) free from dwarf contamination and (b) have good
metallicity estimates, without having to undertake time
consuming spectroscopic observations.

We applied our photometric selection criteria to the
ALLWISE catalog to obtain a large sample of stars from
the Sgr stream. Using the above distance and metallic-
ity relations, we then investigated the properties of the
stream. We conﬁrmed that the plane of the orbit is mis-
aligned for the leading and trailing tails, as is the case for
the main-sequence turn-oﬀ population. The recent detec-
tion of Sgr debris towards the Galactic anti-center (Ko-
posov et al. 2015) was conﬁrmed and, although the WISE
data does not allow us to detect the recently identiﬁed
apocenter of the trailing tail (Belokurov et al. 2014), the
anti-center material clearly forms a bridge between the
known trailing tail and the proposed apocenter detec-
tion. The proposed Branch C of the stream can also be
seen in our M-giant sample and, despite being relatively
tentative, the fact that it has been seen in a range of
tracers (subgiants, red clump stars and now M-giants)
means that it’s unlikely to be spurious. However, we are
unable to conﬁrm that Branch C is an extension of the
trailing tail as we ﬁnd no stars connecting this to the
trailing apocenter material.

Our photometric metallicity relation also allowed us to
investigate the metallicity of the stream. Using a large
sample of stars from a homogeneous population alleviates
biases inherent when using a variety of diﬀerent tracer
populations. The oﬀset between the leading and trailing
material can be clearly seen (Figure 12) and is around
0.2 dex. The fact that there is an oﬀset is consistent with
prediction from the model of Law & Majewski (2010), as
our leading material sample consists of debris stripped
in the last two pericentric passages, while our trailing
sample consists only of debris stripped in the most recent
pericentric passage. There can now be no doubt that the
progenitor system must have been massive, containing
a signiﬁcant radial metallicity gradient, otherwise such
metallicity oﬀsets would not be present along the stream.
M-giants are a valuable resource for studying our
Galaxy. Their bright absolute magnitudes means that
they can be used to trace distant structures in the disc
and halo. In future work we will investigate the disc pop-
ulation, studying low-latitude substructures or the trun-
cation of the stellar disc. A more complete picture can
be inferred when radial velocities are incorporated into
the analysis. For example, the ﬁrst data release of the
LAMOST survey contains almost 10,000 M-giant spec-
tra, which we are now in the process of analyzing. This
will be especially important for dissecting low-latitude
substructures, but will also allow us to conﬁrm the na-
ture of Sgr Branch C and potentially detect new halo
overdensities. As well as substructures, M-giant veloc-
ities can be used to study the global properties of the
Milky Way, for example constraining the mass proﬁle of
the halo.

However, if we minimize potential Tri-And contamina-
tion by avoiding 20 < RA < 60 deg (Deason et al. 2014),
then our ﬁndings remain unchanged, indicating that this
structure is not strongly biasing our results. Contam-
ination from foreground M-dwarfs could also aﬀect our
results, but if we reduce potential contamination by em-
ploying a stricter (J − K)0 cut of 0.95 mag (see Figure
3) our ﬁndings are unchanged.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that WISE+2MASS photometry can
be used to eﬃciently identify M-giant stars. By using
a large sample of spectroscopically conﬁrmed M-giants
from LAMOST we have devised a photometric selection
(Equation 1) that contains only a few per cent dwarf
contamination and negligible contribution from QSOs.
At fainter magnitudes the dwarf contamination will in-
crease, but as we have shown in Section 3 this method is
far superior to those constructed using 2MASS photom-
etry alone.

We have also constructed new photometric distance
relations, using large samples of M-giants from known
structures (e.g. LMC/SMC/Sgr). The variations in
these distance relations reﬂects the diﬀering chemical
composition of these structures. Unlike most previous
attempts to deﬁne distance relations, our approach is en-
tirely empirical and does not rely on stellar models. We
have demonstrated the accuracy of these relations by in-
vestigating the tilt of the LMC. The fact that we are able
to reproduce the previously detected tilt shows that when
averaging over large samples of M-giants, these relations
can be used to obtain precise distances.

As has been noted previously (e.g. Koposov et al. 2015;
Schlaufman & Casey 2014), the WISE IR bands are sen-
sitive to a star’s metallicity. Using the high-S/N, high-
resolution spectroscopic metallicities from APOGEE, we
found a strong correlation between the (W1 −W2 )0 color
and [M/H]. This is well-ﬁt by a linear relation (Equa-

A. EXTINCTION CORRECTION

Since many of our M-giants are at low latitudes, we need to carefully take extinction into account. Recent work by
Davenport et al. (2014) has shown that at near- and mid-infrared bands the dust extinction law varies as a function
of Galactic latitude. This can result in up to an order of magnitude diﬀerence in Aλ/Ar when comparing high- to
low-latitudes.
We account for this latitude dependence using a simple prescription. Taking the data from Figure 8 of Davenport et
al. (2014), we ﬁt the extinction law for each band using a constant value for |b| > 30 deg and a power-law for |b| < 30,

Aλ/Ar = c 10m(|b|−30)

|b| ≥ 30 deg.

calculated using Equation 4, metallicities using Equation 2, and extinctions using Equation A1. Values of E(B − V )
are derived from the maps of Schlegel et al. (1998). This table must be used with caution at low-latitudes, since source
confusion and problems with the extinction maps (e.g. the low resolution) can aﬀect the reliability of the sample.
