C 1,α REGULARITY FOR THE NORMALIZED p-POISSON

PROBLEM

AMAL ATTOUCHI, MIKKO PARVIAINEN, AND EERO RUOSTEENOJA

Abstract. We consider the normalized p-Poisson problem

−∆N

p u = f

in Ω.

The normalized p-Laplacian ∆N
p u := |Du|2−p∆pu is in non-divergence
form and arises for example from stochastic games. We prove C 1,α
loc
regularity with nearly optimal α for viscosity solutions of this problem.
In the case f ∈ L∞ ∩ C and p > 1 we use methods both from viscosity
and weak theory, whereas in the case f ∈ Lq ∩ C, q > max(n, p
2 , 2), and
p > 2 we rely on the tools of nonlinear potential theory.

1. Introduction

In this paper we study local regularity properties of the inhomogeneous

normalized p-Laplace equation
− ∆N

p u = f

The normalized p-Laplacian is deﬁned as

in Ω.

∞u,

∞u := hD2u Du
|Du|

, Du
where ∆N
|Du|i denotes the normalized inﬁnity Laplacian.
The motivation to study these types of normalized operators stems par-
tially from their connections to stochastic games and their applications to
image processing. The normalized p-Laplacian is gradient dependent and
discontinuous, so we cannot directly rely on the existing general C 1,α regu-
larity theory of viscosity solutions. Only H¨older continuity for solutions of
(1.1) follows from the regularity theory for uniformly elliptic equations, see
[Caf89, CC95].

Our aim is to show local H¨older continuity for gradients of viscosity so-
lutions of (1.1) by relying on diﬀerent methods depending on regularity
assumptions of the source term f . Assuming ﬁrst that f ∈ L∞(Ω) ∩ C(Ω),
we use two diﬀerent techniques to show that the solutions of (1.1) for p > 1
are of class C 1,α

loc for α > 0 depending on p and the dimension n.

Theorem 1.1. Assume that p > 1 and f ∈ L∞(Ω) ∩ C(Ω). There exists
α = α(p, n) > 0 such that any viscosity solution u of (1.1) is in C 1,α
loc (Ω),
and for any Ω′ ⊂⊂ Ω,

[u]C1,α(Ω′) ≤ C = C(cid:16)p, n,||u||L∞(Ω),||f||L∞(Ω)(cid:17) .

In the ﬁrst proof of Theorem 1.1, the idea is to ﬁrst show an improvement
of ﬂatness for a slightly modiﬁed version of equation (1.1), and then proceed
by iteration. The second proof is restricted to the case p ≥ 2 and relies on
the known regularity results for quasilinear PDEs after we have shown that
viscosity solutions to (1.1) are weak solutions to

− ∆pu = |Du|p−2f

in Ω.

(1.2)

Notice that in Theorem 1.1 we allow the case inf f < 0 < sup f , and
the proof does not use uniqueness. However, in the second main theorem
our technique relies on uniqueness, which was shown in the case f > 0 in
[KMP12].
Theorem 1.2. Assume that p > 2, q > max(2, n, p/2), f ∈ C(Ω) ∩ Lq(Ω)
and f > 0 (or f < 0). Then the unique viscosity solution u to (1.1) with
continuous boundary data g is in C 1,α
loc (Ω) for some α = α(p, q, n). Moreover,
for any Ω′ ⊂⊂ Ω,

[u]C1,α(Ω′) ≤ C = C(cid:16)p, q, n, Ω,||g||W 1,p(Ω),||f||Lq(Ω)(cid:17) .

The main idea to prove Theorem 1.2 relies on approximation, where we use
classical methods from the weak theory and potential estimates developed
by Duzaar and Mingione in [DM10]. In the proof we also show that under
the assumptions of Theorem 1.2, there exists a weak solution of equation
(1.2) which is in C 1,α

loc (Ω).

It is well known that p-harmonic functions are of class C 1,α0
loc

for some
maximal exponent 0 < α0 < 1 that depends only upon n and p. This
was shown independently by Uraltseva [Ura68] and Uhlenbeck [Uhl77] in
the case p > 2, and later extended to the case p > 1, see [DiB83, Lew83]
and also [Man86] for related research. The question of optimal regularity
for p-Laplace equations in divergence form has attracted a lot of attention
recently, see Section 5 for further references. Since the solutions of (1.1)
should not be expected to be more regular than p-harmonic functions, the
maximal exponent α0 is a natural upper bound for C 1,α regularity for equa-
tion (1.1). In the following theorem we obtain nearly optimal regularity for
solutions of (1.1).
Theorem 1.3. Fix arbitrary ξ ∈ (0, α0), where α0 is the optimal H¨older
exponent for gradients of p-harmonic functions.
If p > 1 and f ∈ L∞(Ω) ∩ C(Ω), then viscosity solutions to (1.1) are in

C 1,α0−ξ

loc

(Ω).

REGULARITY FOR NORMALIZED p-LAPLACIAN

If p > 2, q > max(2, n, p/2), f ∈ C(Ω) ∩ Lq(Ω) and f > 0, then viscosity

1,αξ

solutions to (1.1) are in C

loc (Ω), where αξ := min(α0 − ξ, 1 − n/q).

When the gradient is suﬃciently large, the result follows from the classi-
cal regularity results for uniformly elliptic equations. When the gradient is
small, the ﬁrst step is to use local C 1,α regularity of the solutions of (1.1),
proved in Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, to show that the solutions can be approx-
imated by p-harmonic functions in C 1,α. The next step is to use suitable
rescaled functions and iteration to obtain the required oscillation estimate.

Over the last decade, equation (1.1) and similar normalized equations
have received growing attention, partly due to the stochastic zero-sum tug-
of-war games deﬁned by Peres, Schramm, Sheﬃeld and Wilson in [PS08,
PSSW09]. In [PS08] Peres and Sheﬃeld studied a connection between equa-
tion (1.1) and the game tug-of-war with noise and running pay-oﬀ. The
game-theoretic interpretation led to new regularity proofs in the case f = 0
in [LPS13], and later in the case of bounded and positive f in [Ruo16],
see also [CPCM13] for a PDE approach. Regularity studies were extended
to the parabolic version ut = ∆N
p u in [MPR10, BG15, JS15] and led to
applications in image processing, see e.g.

[Doe11, ETT15].

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we ﬁx the notation and
gather some deﬁnitions and tools which we need later. In Section 3 we give
two proofs for Theorem 1.1, in Section 4 we prove Theorem 1.2, and in
Section 5 Theorem 1.3.

2. Preliminaries

Throughout the paper Ω ⊂ Rn is a bounded domain. For p > 1, we
denote by Λ and λ the ellipticity constants of the normalized p-Laplacian
∆N
p . Recalling the expression

p u = ∆u + (p − 2)∆N
∆N

∞u = tr(cid:18)(I + (p − 2)

Du ⊗ Du

)D2u(cid:19)

and calculating for arbitrary η ∈ Rn, |η| = 1,

h(I + (p − 2)

|Du|2

)η, ηi = |η|2 + (p − 2)hη, Dui2
|Du|2
= 1 + (p − 2)hη, Dui2
|Du|2 ,

we see that Λ = max(p − 1, 1) and λ = min(p − 1, 1).

We will use the Pucci operators

P +(X) := sup

A∈Aλ,Λ − tr(AX)

and

P −(X) := inf

A∈Aλ,Λ − tr(AX),

where Aλ,Λ is a set of symmetric n × n matrices whose eigenvalues belong
to [λ, Λ].
For a, b ∈ Rn, we denote by a⊗b an n×n-matrix for which (a⊗b)ij = aibj.
When studying H¨older and C 1,α regularity, for α ∈ (0, 1] and a ball Br ⊂

Rn we use the notation

[u]C0,α(Br ) :=

sup

x,y∈Br,x6=y

for H¨older continuous functions, and

|u(x) − u(y)|

|x − y|α

[u]C1,α(Br) := [u]C1(Br) +

sup

|Du(x) − Du(y)|

|x − y|α

x,y∈Br,x6=y

for functions of class C 1,α. Here [u]C1(Br) := supx∈Br |Du(x)|.

Recall that weak solutions to −∆pu := − div(|Du|p−2 Du) = 0 are called
p-harmonic functions. We will use the known C 1,α0
loc -regularity of these func-
tions in sections 4 and 5. The existence of the optimal α0 = α0(p, n) follows
from the known regularity estimates for the homogeneous p-Laplace equa-
tion, but the precise value of α0 is unknown when n ≥ 3.

The normalized p-Laplacian is undeﬁned when Du = 0, where it has
a bounded discontinuity. This can be remediated adapting the notion of
viscosity solution using the upper and lower semicontinuous envelopes (re-
laxations) of the operator, see [CIL92].
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let Ω be a bounded domain and 1 < p < ∞. An upper
semicontinuous function u is a viscosity subsolution of (1.1) if for all x0 ∈ Ω
and φ ∈ C 2(Ω) such that u − φ attains a local maximum at x0, one has

p φ(x0) ≤ f (x0), if Dφ(x0) 6= 0,

−∆N

−∆φ(x0) − (p − 2)λmax(D2φ(x0)) ≤ f (x0), if Dφ(x0) = 0 and p ≥ 2,
−∆φ(x0) − (p − 2)λmin(D2φ(x0)) ≤ f (x0), if Dφ(x0) = 0 and 1 < p ≤ 2.

A lower semicontinuous function u is a viscosity supersolution of (1.1) if
for all x0 ∈ Ω and φ ∈ C 2(Ω) such that u − φ attains a local maximum at
x0, one has




p φ(x0) ≥ f (x0), if Dφ(x0) 6= 0,

−∆N
−∆φ(x0) − (p − 2)λmin(D2φ(x0)) ≥ f (x0), if Dφ(x0) = 0 and p ≥ 2,
−∆φ(x0) − (p − 2)λmax(D2φ(x0)) ≥ f (x0), if Dφ(x0) = 0 and 1 < p ≤ 2.
We say that u is a viscosity solution of (1.1) in Ω if it is both a viscosity
sub- and supersolution.

REGULARITY FOR NORMALIZED p-LAPLACIAN

We will make use of the equivalence between weak and viscosity solutions
to the p-Laplace equation ∆pu = 0. This was ﬁrst proved in [JLM01] by
using the full uniqueness machinery of the theory of viscosity solutions, and
later in [JJ12] without relying on the uniqueness. The techniques of the
second paper are particularly important for us in Section 3.2, where we do
not have uniqueness.

3. Two proofs for Theorem 1.1

In this section we give two proofs for Theorem 1.1. In the ﬁrst subsection
we use an iteration method often used to show C 1,α regularity for elliptic
equations. Recently, Imbert and Silvestre [IS13] used this method of show
C 1,α regularity for viscosity solutions of |Du|γF (D2u) = f , where F is
uniformly elliptic.

In Section 3.2 we give another proof for Theorem 1.1 in the case p ≥ 2 by

showing that a viscosity solution to (1.1) is also a weak solution to (1.2).

3.1. First proof by improvement of ﬂatness and iteration. In this
subsection we give a ﬁrst proof for Theorem 1.1. We assume that p > 1 and
f ∈ L∞(Ω) ∩ C(Ω), and we want to show that there exists α = α(p, n) > 0
such that any viscosity solution u of (1.1) is in C 1,α
loc (Ω), and for any Ω′ ⊂⊂ Ω,

[u]C1,α(Ω′) ≤ C = C(cid:16)p, n,||u||L∞(Ω),||f||L∞(Ω)(cid:17) .

Notice that it is suﬃcient to prove that there exists some constant C such

that for all x ∈ Ω and r ∈ (0, 1), there exists q = q(r, x) ∈ Rn for which

osc
Br(x)

(u(y) − q · y) ≤ Cr1+α.

By translation, it is enough to show that the solution is C 1,α at 0. If one
also start with a solution u such that osc u ≤ 1, then it is suﬃcient to
choose a suitable ρ ∈ (0, 1) such that the previous inequality holds true for
r = rk = ρk, q = qk and C = 1 by proceeding by induction on k ∈ N.

The idea of the proof is to ﬁrst study approximating functions w = u−q·x

satisfying

− ∆w − (p − 2)(cid:28)D2w

Dw + q
|Dw + q|

,

Dw + q

|Dw + q|(cid:29) = f

in B1

(3.1)

in a viscosity sense, and show equicontinuity for uniformly bounded solutions
in Lemma 3.1. By Arzel`a-Ascoli theorem we get compactness, which we use
to show improvement of ﬂatness for solutions of (3.1) in Lemma 3.2. Finally,
we prove C 1,α regularity for solutions of (1.1) in Lemma 3.3 by using Lemma
3.2 and iteration.

ATTOUCHI, PARVIAINEN, AND RUOSTEENOJA

For the proofs of Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 we reduce the problem by rescaling.
0 ||f||L∞(B1))−1. Setting ˜u = κu, then ˜u satisﬁes

Let κ = (2||u||L∞(B1) + ε−1

p (˜u) = ˜f

−∆N

2 and || ˜f||L∞(B1) ≤ ε0. Hence, without loss of generality
with ||˜u||L∞(B1) ≤ 1
we may assume in Theorem 1.1 that ||u||L∞(B1) ≤ 1/2 and ||f||L∞(B1) ≤ ε0,
where ε0 = ε0(p, n) is chosen later.

In order to prove Theorem 1.1, we will ﬁrst need the following equiconti-

nuity lemma for viscosity solutions to equation (3.1).
Lemma 3.1. For all r ∈ (0, 1), there exist β = β(p, n, r) ∈ (0, 1) and
C = C(p, n, r, oscB1(w),||f||Ln(B1)) > 0 such that any viscosity solutions w
of (3.1) satisﬁes

[w]C0,β (Br) ≤ C.

(3.2)

Proof. Equation (3.1) can be rewritten as

− tr(cid:18)(cid:18)I + (p − 2)

Du + q

|Du + q| ⊗

Du + q

|Du + q|(cid:19) D2u(cid:19) = f.

Recalling the deﬁnitions of the Pucci operators P + and P − respectively, we
have

(cid:26) P +(D2w) + |f| ≥ 0
P −(D2w) − |f| ≤ 0.

By the classical result of Caﬀarelli in [Caf89, Proposition 4.10], there exists
β1 = β1(r, p, n) ∈ (0, 1) such that

[w]C0,β1 (Br) ≤ C = C p, n, r, osc(w)

B1

,||f||Ln(B1)! .

(cid:3)

Next we show an improvement of ﬂatness for solutions to equation (3.1) by
using the previous lemma together with known regularity results for elliptic
PDEs. Intuitively, we show that graphs of the solutions get more ﬂat when
we look at them in smaller balls.
Lemma 3.2. There exist ε0 ∈ (0, 1) and ρ = ρ(p, n) ∈ (0, 1) such that for
any viscosity solution w of (3.1) with oscB1(w) ≤ 1 and ||f||L∞(B1) ≤ ε0,
there exists q′ ∈ Rn such that
osc
Bρ

(w − q′ · x) ≤

ρ.

Proof. Thriving for a contradiction, assume that there exist a sequence of
functions (fj) with ||fj||L∞(B1) → 0, a sequence of vectors (qj) and a se-
quence of viscosity solutions (wj) with oscB1(wj) ≤ 1 to
Dwj + qj

− ∆wj − (p − 2)(cid:28)D2wj

|Dwj + qj|

|Dwj + qj|(cid:29) = fj,

such that, for all q′ ∈ Rn and any ρ ∈ (0, 1)

.

(3.4)

Using the compactness result of Lemma 3.1, there exists a continuous func-
tion w∞ such that wj → w∞ uniformly in Bρ. Passing to the limit in (3.4),
we have that for any vector q′,

osc
Bρ

(w∞ − q′ · x) >

ρ

.

(3.5)

Suppose ﬁrst that the sequence (qj) is bounded. We consider vj(x) =
wj(x) + qj · x and use the result of Appendix A to extract a subsequence
(vj) converging to a limit v∞ = w∞ + q∞ · x, which satisﬁes

−∆N

p v∞ = 0

in a viscosity sense. Then v∞ is also a viscosity solution to the homogeneous
p-Laplace equation ∆pv = 0, and by the equivalence result ﬁrst proved in
[JLM01], a weak solution to the homogeneous p-Laplace equation. Hence,
there is β1 = β1(p, n) > 0 so that w∞ = v∞ − q∞ · x ∈ C 1,β1
from ej = qj
|qj|

If the sequence (qj) is unbounded, we extract a converging subsequence

, ej → e∞, and obtain (see Appendix A)
− ∆w∞ − (p − 2)(cid:10)D2w∞ e∞, e∞(cid:11) = 0

in B1,
with |e∞| = 1. Noticing that equation (3.6) can be written as

loc (B1).

(3.6)

− tr ((I + (p − 2)e∞ ⊗ e∞)D2w∞),

we see that equation (3.6) is uniformly elliptic and depends only on D2w∞.
By the regularity result of [CC95, Corollary 5.7], there is β2 = β2(p, n) > 0
so that w∞ ∈ C 1,β2
loc .

We have shown that w∞ ∈ C 1,β

(0, 1/2) such that

loc for β = min(β1, β2) > 0. Choose ρ ∈
C0ρβ ≤

By C 1,β

(w∞ − kρ · x) ≤ C0ρ1+β ≤

This contradicts (3.5) so the proof is complete.

Proceeding by iteration, we obtain the following lemma.

(3.8)

(cid:3)

Lemma 3.3. Let ρ and ε0 ∈ (0, 1) be as in Lemma 3.2 and let u be a
viscosity solution of (1.1) with oscB1(u) ≤ 1 and ||f||L∞(B1) ≤ ε0. Then,
there exists α ∈ (0, 1) such that for all k ∈ N, there exists qk ∈ Rn such that

where rk := ρk.

Proof. For k = 0, the estimate (3.9) follows from the assumption oscB1(u) ≤
1. Next we take α ∈ (0, 1) such that ρα > 1/2. We assume for k ≥ 0 that
we already constructed pk ∈ Rn such that (3.9) holds true. To prove the
inductive step k → k + 1, we rescale the solution considering for x ∈ B1

(cid:3)

Since the estimate (3.9) holds for every k, the proof of Theorem 1.1 is

complete.

3.2. Second proof by using weak theory. In this part we establish a
second method to show that viscosity solutions to (1.1) are in C 1,α
loc (Ω), when
f ∈ L∞(Ω) ∩ C(Ω) and p ≥ 2. Recall that equation (1.2) reads as

−∆pu = |Du|p−2f

in Ω.

Since the exponent of the nonlinear gradient term is less than p and f ∈
L∞(Ω), weak solutions of (1.2) are known to be of class C 1,α
for some
loc
α ∈ (0, 1), see [Tol84]. More precisely, if u is a weak solution to (1.2) in B2r,
then

||u||C1,α(Br ) ≤ C = C(cid:16)p, n, r,||u||L∞(B2r ) ,||f||L∞(B2r )(cid:17) .

We know that in the case p ≥ 2 viscosity solutions of (1.1) are viscosity
solutions to (1.2), and our aim is to show that they are also weak solutions
to (1.2). The next theorem holds for a more general case f ∈ Lq(Ω)∩ C(Ω),
where q > max(n, p/2), and will be useful not only in this subsection, but
in Section 5 as well. Our proof cannot rely on uniqueness, see Example
3.5 below. Instead, we use a technique developed by Julin and Juutinen in
[JJ12].
Theorem 3.4. Assume that p ≥ 2, max(n, p/2) < q ≤ ∞, and f ∈ Lq(Ω)∩
C(Ω). Let u be a viscosity solution to (1.1). Then u is a weak solution to
(1.2).

REGULARITY FOR NORMALIZED p-LAPLACIAN

9

Proof. We will prove that a viscosity supersolution u to (1.2) is also a weak
supersolution to (1.2) (the proof adapts to the case of subsolutions with ob-
vious changes). By [CC95, Theorem 3.2], we may assume that u is bounded.
We need to show that

ZΩ |Du|p−2Du · Dϕ dx ≥ZΩ |Du|p−2f ϕ dx,

where ϕ ∈ C∞0 (Ω).
Step 1: regularization. Let us start by showing that the inf-convolution uε
of u,

uε(x) = inf

y∈Ω(cid:18)u(y) + |x − y|2
2ε (cid:19) ,

is a weak supersolution to

(3.10)

(3.11)

where

and

− ∆puε ≥ |Duε|p−2fε

in Ωr(ε),

fε(x) =

inf

|y−x|≤2√ε osc u

f (y)

Ωr(ε) =(cid:8)x : dist(x, ∂Ω) > 2√ε osc u(cid:9) .

We recall some properties of inf-convolutions. For more general discussion
and proofs, see the appendix of [JJ12]. First we mention that uε is a semi-
concave viscosity supersolution to (3.11). Moreover, uε is twice diﬀerentiable
a.e and satisﬁes

−∆puε = −|Duε|p−2(cid:18)∆uε + (p − 2)D2uε

Duε

|Duε| ·

Duε

|Duε|(cid:19)

≥ |Duε|p−2fε

(3.12)
almost everywhere in Ωr(ε). Finally we mention that uε → u uniformly, see
[CIL92].

Since the function φ(x) := uε(x) −

1
2ε|x|2 is concave in Ωr(ε), we can
approximate it by a sequence (φj) of smooth concave functions by using
1
2ε|x|2, we can integrate by

standard molliﬁcation. Denoting uε,j := φj +
parts to obtain

ZΩr(ε) |Duε,j|p−2Duε,j · Dϕ dx =ZΩr(ε)

(−∆puε,j)ϕ dx.

(3.13)

Since Duε is locally bounded, the dominated convergence theorem implies

lim

j→∞ZΩr(ε) |Duε,j|p−2Duε,j · Dϕ dx =ZΩr(ε) |Duε|p−2Duε · Dϕ dx.

(3.14)

10

Next, using the concavity of uε,j (we have D2uε,j ≤ 1
edness of Duε,j, we get

ε I) and the local bound-

C p−2(n + p − 2)
locally in Ωr(ε). Applying Fatou’s lemma, we obtain

−∆puε,j ≥ −

ε

lim inf

j→∞ ZΩr(ε)

(−∆puε,j)ϕ dx ≥ZΩr(ε)

lim inf

(−∆puε,j)ϕ dx.

(3.15)

Since

almost everywhere, by using (3.13), (3.14) and (3.15) we obtain

lim inf
j→∞

(−∆puε,j(x)) = −∆puε(x)

ZΩr(ε) |Duε|p−2Duε · Dϕ dx ≥ZΩr(ε)

(−∆puε)ϕ dx
≥ZΩr(ε) |Duε|p−2fεϕ dx.

Hence, we have shown that uε is a weak supersolution to (3.11).

Step 2: passing to the limit in the regularization. Take an arbitrary test
function ϕ ∈ C∞0 (Ω). We ﬁnish the proof by showing that
ZΩr(ε) |Duε|p−2Duε · Dϕ dx →ZΩ |Du|p−2Du · Dϕ dx
ZΩr(ε) |Duε|p−2fεϕ dx →ZΩ |Du|p−2f ϕ dx.

and

Let Ω′ be the support of ϕ and ε so small that Ω′ ⊂ Ωr(ε). We start
by showing that Duε is uniformly bounded in Lp(Ω′). Take a compactly
supported smooth cut-oﬀ function ξ : Ωr(ε) → [0, 1] such that ξ ≡ 1 on
Ω′. Choose the test function (2L − uε)ξp in the weak formulation, where
L = supΩ′ uε. By using H¨older’s inequality we obtain
ZΩr(ε)

ξp|Duε|p dx ≤ ZΩr(ε) |Duε|p−2(2L − uε)ξ2ξp−2|fε| dx

Hence, Duε is uniformly bounded with respect to ε in Lp(Ω′). It follows
that there exists a subsequence such that Duε → Du weakly in Lp(Ω′), and

we can also show that Duε → Du strongly in Lp(Ω′). Indeed, taking this
time the test function (u − uε)ξp, we estimate

AddingRΩ |Du|p−2Du· (Du− Duε)ξp dx to this inequality and recalling that

we get

By using the local uniform convergence of uε to u, the facts Du ∈ Lp(Ω′),
||fε||Lq(Ωr(ε)) ≤ C(q, Ω)||f||Lq(Ω) and the weak convergence of Duε in Lp(Ω′),
we obtain

ZΩr(ε) |Du − Duε|pξp dx → 0,

so Duε → Du strongly in Lp(Ω′).

Finally, we are ready to show that (3.16) and (3.17) hold. First we use

2q−p ≤ C||fε − f||Lq → 0.

To estimate I2, notice ﬁrst that since f and ϕ are continuous in Ω, f ϕ is

ment, also (3.16) holds. The proof is complete.

Finally, we give an example to show why we deliberately avoided using
the uniqueness machinery. For similar counterexamples in the case of the
inﬁnity Laplacian, see [CF15].

Example 3.5. We give an example to show that for given continuous bound-
ary data, there can be several weak solutions to equation (1.2). Let f =
(p− 1). Consider the 1-dimensional situation, where for R ∈ [0, 1] we deﬁne
a function

This gives diﬀerent weak solutions for the whole range of R. Indeed, for any

Only the largest i.e. R = 0 is a solution to the original −∆N

This counterexample also shows that in general weak solutions to (1.2)

are not necessary viscosity solutions to (1.1).

4. Uniform gradient estimates when f ∈ C(Ω) ∩ Lq(Ω)
In this section we assume that p > 2, f ∈ C(Ω) ∩ Lq(Ω) for some q >
max(cid:0)n, p
2 , 2(cid:1), and f > 0. We also assume that the complement Ωc is p-
thick, see [HKM93] for deﬁnition. Our aim is to prove Theorem 1.2, which
states that the unique viscosity solution to (1.1) is of class C 1,α
loc (Ω) for some
α = α(p, q, n), and for any Ω′ ⊂⊂ Ω,

||u||C1,β (Ω′) ≤ C = C(cid:16)p, q, n, Ω,||g||W 1,p(Ω),||f||Lq(Ω)(cid:17) .

By Ω dependence we mean that the constant depends both on the measure
and diameter of Ω.

REGULARITY FOR NORMALIZED p-LAPLACIAN

The idea for the proof of Theorem 1.2 is to obtain uniform estimates for

solutions uε to the following regularized problems

Here fε = ηεf , where ηε is a smooth cut-oﬀ function satisfying ηε ≡ 1 on
{x : −1/ε ≤ f (x) ≤ 1/ε}, g ∈ W 1,p(Ω)∩C(Ω), and uε = g on the boundary
means that uε−g ∈ W 1,p
(Ω). Notice that the right-hand side of the equation
is bounded.

Since the regularized equations are uniformly elliptic with smooth coeﬃ-
cients and bounded right-hand side, in Step 1 we notice that uε ∈ C 1,β(ε)
(Ω)∩
W 2,2
loc (Ω). In the next two steps we obtain uniform estimates for the norms
loc(Ω). Once we know that |Duε|p−2 is locally uni-
||Duε||Lp(Ω) and ||Duε||L∞
formly bounded, in Step 4 we use the regularity result of Lieberman [Lie93]
loc(Ω) for some β > 0. By using the
to get a uniform estimate for ||Duε||Cβ
equicontinuity of (Duε), we obtain a subsequence (uε) converging to a vis-
cosity solution v of equation (1.1) in C 1,α
loc (Ω) for some 0 < α < β when
ε → 0.

According to [KMP12, Theorem 5], for f > 0 and given continuous bound-
ary data g, there is a unique viscosity solution u to equation (1.1). By using
uniqueness, we conclude in Step 5 that the function v is the unique solution
to (1.1) with given boundary data g. This gives a proof for Theorem 1.2.

Step 1: Local C 1,β regularity for uε. Notice that our regularized oper-
ator is uniformly elliptic and uε ∈ g + W 1,p
(Ω). Regularity theory implies
that the solutions uε are Lipschitz continuous, and since the right hand side
is bounded, we also have uε ∈ C(Ω) ∩ C 1,α(ε)
loc (Ω) (see [LU68,
Theorem 8.7, pp. 311], and also [DiB83, Tol84] for more general regularity
results.) This observation is useful, since we will derive estimates for Duε
by using test functions involving the derivatives of uε.

Step 3: Local uniform estimate for ||Duε||L∞
we derive a uniform local gradient estimate for uε by combining [DM10,
Theorem 1.5] with the previous estimates (4.3)-(4.7). We follow the main
steps of Duzaar and Mingione [DM10]. For the sake of completeness, we
give some details of these steps.

The Duzaar-Mingione gradient estimate relies on the use of a nonlinear

Typically, nonlinear potential theory gives useful tools when dealing with
boundedness and continuity of the gradient. Let us recall the main ingredi-
ents of the proof of the result of [DM10]. A key step is to derive a Caccioppoli
p
type estimate for the function (|Duε|2 + ε2)
2 with a suitable remainder in-
volving |fε|2. Relying on the regularity result of Step 1, this can be done by
taking

ϕij(x) :=

∂

∂xj (cid:18)η(x)2((|Duε(x)|2 + ε2)

p

2 − k)+

∂uε(x)

∂xi (cid:19)

as test functions in the weak formulation, where η is a non negative cut-oﬀ
function. Next, a modiﬁcation of the De Giorgi techniques allowed them
to get pointwise estimate of |Duε|p in terms of the L2p norm of Duε and
the nonlinear potential P fε. Finally, using interpolation, they improved the
estimate in terms of the natural Lp norm of the gradient and the L∞ norm
of the nonlinear potential.

Our approximation is slightly diﬀerent, but the Caccioppoli type estimate
of [DM10, Lemma 3.1] (adapted for the new right hand side) holds for 2 <
p ≤ n and also for p > n. Indeed, by using the weak formulation with the test

such that for any ball BR ⊂ Ω,

holds. Once we have such control on the level sets of |Duε|p, a standard

Consequently, combining (4.3), (4.5), (4.7) and (4.9) we get

Step 5: Convergence in the weak and viscosity sense and conclu-
sion. We get from (4.10) and Arzel`a-Ascoli theorem that (uε) converges (up
to a subsequence) to a function u in C 1,α

Passing to the limit within the weak formulation, u is a weak solution to

− ∆pu = |Du|p−2f,

(4.11)

see Appendix B for details.

On the other hand, the local H¨older continuity of Duε and the continuity

of fε imply that uε is also a classical solution to

(4.12)

We conclude that uε is a continuous viscosity solutions of the associated
Dirichlet problem to equation (4.12) with continuous boundary data g. Ap-
plying the ABP estimate (see [Koi04, Proposition 6.2]) for uε we obtain

||uε||L∞(Ω) ≤ C(p, n, Ω)(||g||L∞(Ω) + ||fε||Ln(Ω)).

It follows that u is a bounded weak solution of the Dirichlet problem as-
sociated to (4.11). Let us prove that u ∈ C(Ω) and for any x0 ∈ ∂Ω
lim
u(x) = g(x0). When p > n, we get from the boundedness of ||uε||W 1,p(Ω)
x→x0
and Morrey’s inequality that uε are uniformly bounded in C 0,1−n/p(Ω), and

The statement then follows straightforwardly by passing to the limit.

||uε||C0,1−n/p(Ω) ≤ C ||uε||W 1,p(Ω) ≤ ˜C = ˜C(cid:16)p, n, Ω,||g||W 1,p(Ω) ,||f||L
2 (Ω)(cid:17) .
When 2 < p ≤ n, we use the boundedness of u and the Wiener criterion
for the continuity on the boundary. The right hand side of (4.11) satisﬁes

Since f is assumed to be in Lq(Ω) for some q > n, it is easy to check that
|f|p/2 ∈ Ln/(p−δ)(Ω) for 0 < δ < 1. Recall that the complement Ωc is p-
thick. Applying the result of Gariepy and Ziemer [GZ77, Theorem 2.5], we
get that u satisﬁes the boundary condition in the classical sense. The reader
can ﬁnd further discussion of the boundary regularity problem for elliptic
equations in the monograph of Mal´y and Ziemer [MZ97].

The limit function u is also a viscosity solution of (1.1), see Appendix
C. By uniqueness, we conclude that the limit function u is the unique vis-
cosity solution of (1.1), and also a weak solution of class C 1,α
for some
loc
α = α(p, q, n). Hence we have proved Theorem 1.2.

and α0 is the optimal H¨older exponent for gradients of p-harmonic functions.
In the case q = ∞ we only assume that p > 1, whereas in the case q < ∞
we require p > 2.

The precise value of the optimal H¨older exponent for gradients of p-
harmonic functions is known on the plane, see [IM89], but remains a major
open problem in higher dimensions. The related question of optimal regular-
ity for inhomogeneous p-Laplacian in divergence form has received attention
as well, see [LL13, KM14, ATU15, AZ15]. However, here we do not try to
quantify the explicit optimal value of α in C 1,α estimate to the homogenous
case.

5.1. The case q = ∞. In this subsection we prove Theorem 1.3 when
f ∈ L∞(Ω)∩ C(Ω). Since our results are local, from now on we will work in
the unit ball B1 ⊂ Ω and show the regularity at 0 ∈ B1 ⊂ Ω. Like previously,
it is useful to do suitable rescaling to get an Arzel`a-Ascoli type compactness
lemma. During the rest of this section, for δ0 > 0 to be determined later, we
assume that ||u||L∞(B1) ≤ 1 and ||f||L∞(B1) ≤ δ0 without loss of generality.
Indeed, if u satisﬁes −∆N

p u = f , then v(x) = u(θx)/||u||L∞(B1) solves

p v(x) =

f (θx).

v is a solution to (5.1) with small enough right-hand side.

For convenience, in this subsection we denote by C diﬀerent constants

depending only on p and n.

First we use our regularity result from Section 3 to show that the solutions
loc for some small

to (1.1) can be approximated by p-harmonic functions in C 1,α
α > 0.
Lemma 5.1. Let u ∈ C(B1) be a viscosity solution to equation (1.1). For
given ε > 0, there exists δ0 = δ0(p, n, ε) such that for ||u||L∞(B1) ≤ 1,
||f||L∞(B1) ≤ δ0, there exists a p-harmonic function h in B3/4 satisfying

||u − h||L∞(B1/2) < ε

and

||Du − Dh||L∞(B1/2) < ε.

Proof. Suppose that the lemma is not true. Then, for some ε0 > 0 there is
a uniformly bounded sequence of continuous functions (uj) and a sequence
(fj) ⊂ C(Ω) ∩ L∞(Ω), ||fj||L∞(B1) → 0, such that

−∆N

p uj = fj,

but for all p-harmonic functions h deﬁned in B3/4 we have either ||u −
h||L∞(B1/2) ≥ ε0 or ||Du − Dh||L∞(B1/2) ≥ ε0.

By Theorem 1.1, (uj) ⊂ C 1,α(B1/2) for some α > 0, so by the Arzel`a-
Ascoli theorem there is a subsequence, still denoted by (uj), which converges
to some function h in C 1,α(B1/2). Then the limit function h satisﬁes ∆N
p h =

20

ATTOUCHI, PARVIAINEN, AND RUOSTEENOJA

0 in the viscosity sense, so it also satisﬁes ∆ph = 0 in the weak sense. By
C 1,α convergence, there is j0 ∈ N such that ||uj0 − h||L∞(B1/2) < ε0 and
||Duj0 − Dh||L∞(B1/2) < ε0. We have reached a contradiction.

(cid:3)

By using the approximation with p-harmonic functions, in the next lemma
we obtain an oscillation estimate for solutions u to (1.1) near the critical set
{x : Du(x) = 0}.
Lemma 5.2. There exist λ0 ∈ (0, 1
2 ) and δ0 > 0 such that if ||f||L∞(B1) ≤ δ0
and u ∈ C 1,α(B1) is a viscosity solution to (1.1) in B1 with ||u||L∞(B1) ≤ 1,
then

sup
x∈Bλ0

|u(x) − u(0)| ≤ λ

1+αξ

+ |Du(0)|λ0.

Proof. Take the approximating p-harmonic function h from the previous
lemma. By the known regularity of p-harmonic functions, there exist λ0 ∈

The result follows by the triangle inequality.

(cid:3)

Next we iterate the previous estimate to control the oscillation of the

solutions in dyadic balls.

Theorem 5.3. Under the assumptions of the previous lemma, there exists
a constant C such that

sup

x∈Br |u(x) − u(0)| ≤ Cr1+αξ(cid:0)1 + |Du(0)|r−αξ(cid:1)
for all suﬃciently small r ∈ (0, 1).

Let us show by induction that ||vk||L∞(B1) ≤ 1. By the previous lemma,
this holds for k = 1, so assume that ||vj||L∞(B1) ≤ 1 for j ≤ k. As shown
above, the function vk satisﬁes the conditions of the previous lemma, so we
have

(cid:3)

We are ready to show C

regularity for solutions to equation (1.1). If
the gradient Du(0) is very small, we obtain the result from the previous
theorem. In the other case the result follows from a more classical reasoning
using the regularity theory of uniformly elliptic equations.

Theorem 5.4. Under the assumptions of Lemma 5.2, we have for all suf-
ﬁciently small r ∈ (0, 1),

Proof. When |Du(0)| ≤ rαξ , Theorem 5.3 gives

It follows that w solves a uniformly elliptic equation in Bγ, so by [GT01,
Theorem 9.11], for arbitrary ε > 0, w ∈ C 1,βε(Bγ) for βε = 1 − ε.
In
particular, w ∈ C 1,αξ (Bγ). Hence, for all s ∈ (0, γ

This theorem completes the proof of Theorem 1.3 when f ∈ C(Ω)∩L∞(Ω).
5.2. The case f ∈ C ∩ Lq. In this subsection we assume that f ∈ C(B1) ∩
Lq(B1), f > 0, and use Theorem 1.2 to show that the solutions to equation

loc . As previously, for δ0 > 0 to be determined later,
(1.1) are of class C
we take the assumptions ||u||L∞(B1) ≤ 1 and ||f||Lq(B1) ≤ δ0 without loss
of generality. We also denote by C diﬀerent constants depending only on p
and n.

We follow the reasoning of the ﬁrst subsection. First we show that the
solutions to equation (1.1) can be approximated by p-harmonic functions in
C 1,α
loc .
Lemma 5.5. Let u ∈ C(B1), ||u||L∞(B1) ≤ 1, be a viscosity solution to
equation (1.1). Given ε > 0, there is δ0 = δ0(p, n, ε) such that if ||f||Lq(B1) ≤
δ0, there is a p-harmonic function h in B3/4 satisfying

||u − h||L∞(B1/2) < ε

and

||Du − Dh||L∞(B1/2) < ε.

Proof. Thriving for contradiction, assume that there exists ε0 > 0 such
that there are sequences (uj), (fj), fj > 0, satisfying ||uj||L∞(B1) ≤ 1,
||fj||Lq(B1) → 0, and

but for all p-harmonic functions h in B3/4

−∆N

p uj = fj,

||uj − h||L∞(B1/2) > ε0

or

||Duj − Dh||L∞(B1/2) > ε0.

Recall from Theorem 3.4 that uj is a weak solution to

−∆puj = |Duj|p−2f

in Ω.

From Theorem 1.2 we know that (uj) ⊂ C 1,α(B3/4) for some α > 0, so
by Arzel`a-Ascoli theorem, there is a subsequence, still denoted by (uj),
converging in C 1,α(B3/4)-topology to a function h. By Appendix B, h is a
p-harmonic function. We have reached a contradiction.
(cid:3)

The next lemma follows from the previous approximation result as in the

ﬁrst subsection.

The proof of Theorem 1.3 is complete.

Appendix A. The limit equation in Lemma 3.2

We prove two convergence results needed in the proof of Lemma 3.2.
Assume that there exist a sequence of functions (fj) with ||fj||L∞(B1) → 0,
a sequence of vectors (qj) and a sequence of viscosity solutions (wj) with
oscB1 wj ≤ 1 to

(qj) is bounded. First we show that if (qj) is bounded, then
Case 1:
for the sequence vj : B1 → R, vj(x) = wj(x) + qj · x, we have (up to a
subsequence) vj → v∞ uniformly, where

− ∆N

p v∞ = 0.

(A.1)

We show that v∞ is a subsolution of (A.1) (the case of supersolution being
similar). We ﬁx φ ∈ C 2(Ω) such that v∞−φ has a strict maximum at x0. As
v∞ is the uniform limit of the subsequence (vj) and x0 is a strict maximum
point, there exists a sequence of points xj → x0 such that (vj − φ) has a
local maximum at xj.

Suppose ﬁrst that Dφ(x0) 6= 0. Then Dφ(xj) 6= 0 when j is large, and at

those points we have

− tr(D2φ(xj)) − (p − 2)(cid:10)D2φ(xj)Dφ(xj ), Dφ(xj)(cid:11)

Passing to the limit, we get the desired result.

≤ fj(xj).

Suppose next that Dφ(x0) = 0. We have to consider two cases. Assuming
that there exists a subsequence still indexed by j such that |Dφ(xj)| > 0 for
all j in the subsequence, then

− tr(D2φ(xj)) − (p − 2)(cid:10)D2φ(xj)Dφ(xj ); Dφ(xj)(cid:11)

|Dφ(xj)|2

≤ fj(xj),

and we conclude by passing to the limit. If such a subsequence does not
exist, then we have

− tr(D2φ(xj)) − (p − 2)λmax(D2φ(xj)) ≤ fj(xj)

for j large enough. Passing to the limit we get

− tr(D2φ(x0)) − (p − 2)λmax(D2φ(x0)) ≤ 0.

We have shown the desired result.

Case 2: (qj) is unbounded. When (qj) is unbounded, take a subsequence,
still denoted by (qj), for which |qj| → ∞, and then a converging subsequence
from ej = qj

We only show that w∞ is a subsolution of (A.2) (the case of supersolution
is similar). We ﬁx φ ∈ C 2(Ω) such that w∞ − φ has a strict maximum at
x0. By the uniform convergence of wj to w∞, there are points xj such that
wj − φ has a maximum at xj and xj → x0. Since Dφ(xj) → Dφ(x0) and

Appendix B. Convergence in the weak formulation

Assume that p > 2, q > max(2, n, p/2), fε, f ∈ C(Ω)∩ Lq(Ω), fε > 0, and

fε → f in Lq(Ω). We show that if uε is a weak solution to

−∆puε = |Duε|p−2fε,

and if uε → u in C 1,α(K) for any K ⊂⊂ Ω, then u is a weak solution to

−∆pu = |Du|p−2f.
For any test function ϕ ∈ C∞0 (Ω), uε satisﬁes

ZΩ |Duε|p−2Duε · Dϕ dx =ZΩ |Duε|p−2fεϕ dx.

Since Duε → Du locally uniformly, we have for all suﬃciently small ε,

|Duε|p−2|Duε · Dϕ| ≤ (||Du||L∞
so by the dominated convergence theorem,

loc(Ω) + 1)p−1|Dϕ| ∈ L1(Ω),

ZΩ |Duε|p−2Duε · Dϕ dx →ZΩ |Du|p−2Du · Dϕ dx.

It remains to show that

ZΩ |Duε|p−2fεϕ dx →ZΩ |Du|p−2f ϕ dx.

(B.1)

Notice that

|Duε|p−2fεϕ = |Duε|p−2(fε − f )ϕ + |Duε|p−2f ϕ.

(B.2)
Since Duε ∈ L∞(Ω), by the dominated convergence and identity (B.2), (B.1)
holds.

Appendix C. Convergence in the viscosity sense

For a function f ∈ C(Ω), set fε = ηεf where ηε is a smooth cut oﬀ-
function satisfying ηε ≡ 1 on {x ∈ Ω,−1/ε ≤ f (x) ≤ 1/ε}. Let uε be a
viscosity solution to

(C.1)

and assume that uε → u locally uniformly in Ω. We prove that the limit u is
a viscosity solution of (1.1). We only show that u is a viscosity subsolution.
To show that u is a viscosity super-solution, one proceeds similarly. Let
ϕ ∈ C 2 be such that u − ϕ has a local strict maximum at x0. Since uε → u
locally uniformly, there exists a sequence xε → x0 such that uε − ϕ has a

28

ATTOUCHI, PARVIAINEN, AND RUOSTEENOJA

local maximum at xε. Since uε is a viscosity solution of (4.12), it follows
that

−∆ϕ(x0) − (p − 2)λmax(D2ϕ(x0)) ≤ f (x0).

It follows that for any test function ϕ such that u − ϕ reaches a local maxi-
mum at x0, we have

D2ϕ(x0)Dϕ(x0) · Dϕ(x0)

|Dϕ(x0)|2

−∆ϕ(x0) − (p − 2)
−∆ϕ(x0) − (p − 2)λmax(D2ϕ(x0)) ≤ f (x0)
Since f > 0, we conclude from the equivalence of diﬀerent deﬁnitions of
a viscosity solution to the normalized p-Laplacian [KMP12][Proposition 4],
that u is a viscosity sub-solution of (1.1).

≤ f (x0)
if Dϕ(x0) 6= 0
if Dϕ(x0) = 0 and D2ϕ(x0) = 0
