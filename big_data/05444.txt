ON THE AXIOMATIZABILITY OF C∗-ALGEBRAS AS

OPERATOR SYSTEMS

ISAAC GOLDBRING AND THOMAS SINCLAIR

Abstract. We show that the class of unital C∗-algebras is an elemen-
tary class in the language of operator systems. As a result, we have that
there is a deﬁnable predicate in the language of operator systems that
deﬁnes the multiplication in any C∗-algebra. Moreover, we prove that
the aforementioned class is ∀∃∀-axiomatizable but not ∀∃-axiomatizable
nor ∃∀-axiomatizable.

Recall that a C∗-algebra is a ∗-subalgebra of B(H), the ∗-algebra of bounded
operators on a complex Hilbert space, that is closed in the operator norm
topology. In this note, we assume that all C∗-algebras are unital, namely
that they contain the identity operator. As shown in [5, Proposition 3.3],
there is a natural (continuous) ﬁrst-order language LC∗ in which KC∗, the
class of LC∗-structures that are unital C∗-algebras, is an elementary class,
meaning that there is a (universal) LC∗-theory TC∗ for which KC∗ is the class
of models of TC∗; in symbols, KC∗ = Mod(TC∗ ). (The authors only treat not
necessarily unital C∗-algebras, but one just adds a constant to name the
identity with no additional complications.)

An operator system is a ∗-closed subspace of B(H) that is closed in the op-
erator norm topology. The appropriate morphisms between operator systems
are the unital completely positive linear maps. There is a natural ﬁrst-order
language Los in which the class of operator systems is universally axiomatiz-
able; see [3, Subsection 3.3] and [7, Appendix B]. Since the operator system
structure on a C∗-algebra is uniformly quantiﬁer-free deﬁnable, we may as-
sume that Los ⊆ LC∗. For a C∗-algebra A, we let A|Los denote the reduct of
A to Los, which simply means that we view A merely as an operator system
rather than as a C∗-algebra. Set KC∗|Los := {A|Los
: A ∈ KC∗}. In [6],
the following question was raised: is KC∗|Los an elementary class? The main
result of this note is to give an aﬃrmative answer to this question.
We ﬁrst need a lemma, which is nearly identical to [2, Theorem 6.1].
Some notation: for a C∗-algebra B and x, y, z, b ∈ B, let ϕ(x, y, z, b) be the
Los-formula

Lemma 1. Suppose that A is a subsystem of the unital C∗-algebra B. Then
A is closed under products if and only if we have

sup
x,y∈A1

inf
z∈A1

sup
b∈B2

ϕ(x, y, z, b) = 0.

Proof. Fix ǫ ∈ (0, 1) and x, y ∈ A1. Choose z ∈ A1 such that

ϕ(x, y, z, b) < ǫ

sup
b∈B2

and let b be the square root of kxx∗ + zz∗k · 1 − xx∗ − zz∗ ∈ B so that
kbk2 = kb2k ≤ kxx∗ + zz∗k ≤ 2. Multiplying [2 · 1 x z
b] by its adjoint
have that

2 = 4 · 1 + xx∗ + zz∗ + bb∗ = (4 + kxx∗ + zz∗k) · 1.
b(cid:13)(cid:13)

Similarly, it holds that

(cid:13)(cid:13)2 · 1 x z

.

Examining the second row, it follows that the norm of the right side is at

Conversely, the above calculations show that if A is multiplicatively closed,
(cid:3)

least (kxy∗ + zk2 + (4 + kxx∗ + zz∗k)2)1/2, whence kxy∗ + zk ≤ 4√ǫ. As A
is complete, it follows that xy∗ ∈ A.
then setting z = −xy∗ suﬃces.
Theorem 2. Let B be a C∗-algebra. If A ⊂ B is a subsystem of B which is
an elementary substructure in the language of operator systems, then A is a
C∗-subalgebra of B.

Proof. Since A inherits the unit of B and A is self-adjoint, we need only check
that A is closed under products, that is, we need only verify the condition
of the previous lemma. Fixing x, y ∈ A1, we have
ϕ(x, y, z, b) = 0.

inf
z∈B1

sup
b∈B2

Since A is an elementary substructure of B, we have

inf
z∈A1

sup
b∈A2

ϕ(x, y, z, b) = 0.

Fix ǫ > 0 and take z ∈ A1 such that

sup
b∈A2

ϕ(x, y, z, b) ≤ ǫ.

By elementarity again, we have

whence we have

sup
b∈B2

ϕ(x, y, z, b) ≤ ǫ,

inf
z∈A1

sup
b∈B2

ϕ(x, y, z, b) = 0,

which is what we desired.

Corollary 3. KC∗|Los is an elementary class.
Proof. We use the semantic test for axiomatizability, that is, we show that
KC∗|Los is closed under isomorphism, ultraproduct, and ultraroot. (See [1,
Proposition 5.14].) Closure under isomorphism and ultraproducts is clear.
We thus only need to show that KC∗|Los is closed under ultraroots. So
suppose that A is an Los-structure for which AU ∈ KC∗|Los. Note that this
implies that A is an operator subsystem of AU , whence A is an elementary
substructure by Łos’ theorem. Thus A is a C∗-subalgebra of AU .
(cid:3)

We recall the Beth Deﬁnability Theorem (see, for example, the proof of

[4, Theorem 3.5.1]):
Fact 4. Suppose that T is a theory in a language L and T ⊆ T ′ where T ′ is
a theory in a language L′ with no new sorts. Further suppose that, for any
model M of T ′ and any automorphism σ of M|L, σ is also an automorphism
of M . Then every predicate in L′ is T ′-equivalent to a deﬁnable predicate
in L, that is, there is a sequence ϕn(~x) of L-formulae such that, for all
A ∈ Mod(T ′) and all ~a ∈ A, we have that ϕA
n (~a) converges uniformly to
P A(~a).

Let TC∗,os be an Los-theory such that KC∗|Los = Mod(TC∗,os). A well-
known consequence of Pisier’s Linearization Trick (see Corollary 16 below
for a short proof) implies that any complete order isomorphism between two
C∗-algebras is actually a ∗-isomorphism. We thus have:
Corollary 5. There is an Los-deﬁnable predicate P such that, for any C∗-
algebra A and any x, y, z ∈ A1, we have

P A(x, y, z) = d(x · y, z).

We now consider the quantiﬁer-complexity of an axiomatization for KC∗|Los.
Recall that if X is an operator system and u ∈ X, then u is called a unitary
of X if u is a unitary of the C∗-envelope C∗
e(X).
Proposition 6. KC∗|Los is not ∀∃-axiomatizable.
Proof. If KC∗|Los were ∀∃-axiomatizable, then there would be A ∈ KC∗|Los
that is existentially closed for KC∗|Los. However, in [6, Section 5], it was
observed that if φ : X → Y is a complete order embedding that is also exis-
tential, then φ maps unitaries to unitaries. Take a complete order embedding
of A into a C∗-algebra B that is not a ∗-homomorphism (see, for example,
[6, Section 5]); since this embedding maps unitaries to unitaries (since A is
existentially closed for K), this contradicts Corollary 15.
(cid:3)
Remark 7. In [6, Section 5], it was observed that if the set of unitaries
in operator systems is deﬁnable (uniformly over all operator systems), then
KC∗|Los is elementary. (This is equivalent to the statement that if (Xi) is a
family of operator systems and u is a unitary of QU Xi, then there are uni-
taries ui in Xi such that u = (ui)•.) In fact, if unitaries in operator systems
were deﬁnable, then the following axioms would axiomiatize KC∗|Los:

4

ISAAC GOLDBRING AND THOMAS SINCLAIR

(i) the universal axioms for operator systems;
(ii) supx∈A1 infu1,...,u4∈U (A) d(x, 1
(iii)




v

x∗ u∗ 1

 , M3(A)+
 = 0.

To see this, ﬁrst note that an operator system is a C∗-algebra if and only if it
is spanned by its unitaries and is closed under the product of two unitaries.
The axiom in (ii) implies that the unitaries span; moreover, in a C∗-algebra,
any self-adjoint element is an average of two unitaries, whence the axiom in
(ii) is true in any C∗-algebra. Moreover, a result of Walter ([9]) shows that
the matrix appearing in axiom (iii) is positive if and only if x = uv.

While we still do not know if the unitaries in operator systems are deﬁn-
able, the previous proposition shows that if they are deﬁnable, then they
are not deﬁnable by an inf-predicate, for otherwise the above axioms would
give an ∀∃-axiomatization of KC∗|Los. This latter statement would have the
following consequence: there is an inclusion X ⊆ Y of operator systems and
an element x ∈ X such that the distance from x to the unitaries in X is
larger than the distance from x to the unitaries in Y .

Proposition 8. KC∗|Los is not ∃∀-axiomatizable.
Proof. Fix a C∗-algebra A and an operator system X that is not a C∗-algebra
with A ⊆ X ⊆ AU . Suppose, towards a contradiction, that KC∗|Los is ∃∀-
axiomatizable and let σ := infx supy ϕ(x, y) be such an axiom. Fix ǫ > 0 and
take a ∈ A such that (supy ϕ(a, y))A ≤ ǫ. It follows that (supy ϕ(a, y))AU
≤
ǫ, whence (supy ϕ(a, y))X ≤ ǫ. Since a ∈ X and ǫ > 0 was arbitrary, we see
that σX = 0. Since σ was an arbitrary axiom, we see that X is a C∗-algebra,
yielding a contradiction.
(cid:3)

To obtain some positive results, it is convenient to expand our language.

For each n ≥ 1, let ψn(u) denote the Los-formula
x (cid:21)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
(cid:20)u ⊗ 1n

kxk≤1 min(k(cid:2)u ⊗ 1n x(cid:3)k2, (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

inf

2) − kxk2! .

It was observed in [6] that if X is an operator system and u ∈ X is a
contraction, then u is a unitary of X if and only if ψn(u)X = 2 for all n ≥ 1.
Let L#
os be the language obtained from Los obtained by adding new unary
predicates Qn for n ≥ 1. Let T #
C∗,os be the L#-theory obtained from TC∗,os
by adding, for each n ≥ 1, the axiom

sup
u |Qn(u) − ψn(u)| = 0.

Proposition 9. T #

C∗,os is ∀∃-axiomatizable.

Proof. If A1 ⊆ A2 ⊆ A3 ⊆ ··· is an ascending sequence of models of T #
C∗,os,
then each Am is a C∗-algebra and the inclusions are complete order embed-
dings that preserve each predicate Pn, whence map unitaries to unitaries. It
follows from Corollary 15 that the inclusions are ∗-homomorphisms, whence
the union is a C∗-algebra and hence a model of TC∗,os. It is readily veriﬁed
that the axioms of T #
C∗,os not in TC∗,os also hold in the union, whence the
union is a model of T #
C∗,os.
(cid:3)

In classical logic, the next corollary would be immediate. In the continuous

os-axiom for T #

case, a few words are in order.
Corollary 10. TC∗,os is ∀∃∀-axiomatizable.
Proof. Let σ := supx infy ϕ(x, y) = 0 be an L#
C∗,os. We can
view ϕ as an Los-formula by replacing any occurrence of the new predicates
Qn by the Los-formula ψn. Fix ǫ > 0 and take a restricted Los-formula
θ(x, y) that approximates ϕ to within ǫ. (See [1, Section 6] for the deﬁni-
tion of restricted formula.) The key property of restricted formulae is that
they are monotone in their arguments. Thus, an easy induction shows that
any formula formed from restricted connectives and atomic and existential
formulae is logically equivalent to both a ∀∃- and a ∃∀-formulae. It follows
that, without loss of generality, we may assume that θ is an ∃∀-formula of
Los. The axiom supx infy(θ(x, y) −. ǫ) = 0 is an ∀∃∀-axiom and the totality
of these axioms has the same expressive power as the original axiom.
Remark 11. It would be interesting to identify concrete ∀∃∀-axioms for
TC∗,os; the “quasi-sentences” appearing in the statement of Lemma 1 come
tantalizingly close to such axioms.

os-deﬁnable predicate in T #

We can also use this extended language to give some quantiﬁer informa-
tion about the Los-deﬁnable predicate P deﬁning the graph of the algebra
operation.
Proposition 12. P is a quantiﬁer-free L#
Proof. If A ⊆ B is an inclusion of models of T #
inclusions is an inclusion of C∗-algebras, whence it preserves P .
Corollary 13. For each m ≥ 1, there is a continuous function fm : Rk(m) →
R and Los-formulae ϕ1(a, b, c), . . . , ϕk(m)(a, b, c) such that each ϕi is either
an atomic Los-formula or else some ψn and such that, for every C∗-algebra
A and every a, b, c ∈ A1, we have

Appendix on Pisier’s Linearization Trick

The following facts follow immediately from Stinespring’s Dilation Theo-

rem; see, for example, [8, Theorem 18].
Fact 14. Suppose that φ : A → B is a u.c.p. map between C∗-algebras. Then
for all x, y ∈ A, we have

and

φ(x)∗φ(x) ≤ φ(x∗x)

kφ(y∗x) − φ(y)∗φ(x)k ≤ kφ(y∗y) − φ(y)∗φ(y)k1/2kφ(x∗x) − φ(x)∗φ(x)k1/2.
Corollary 15. Suppose that φ : A → B is u.c.p. map between C∗-algebras
that maps unitaries to unitaries. Then φ is a ∗-homomorphism.

Proof. The previous fact shows that the set

Mφ := {a ∈ A : φ(a∗)φ(a) = φ(a∗a), φ(a)φ(a∗) = φ(aa∗)}

is a C∗-subalgebra of A on which φ is a ∗-homomorphism. By assumption
we have that U (A) ⊂ Mφ whence Mφ = A.
(cid:3)
Corollary 16. Suppose that φ : A → B is a linear isometry between C∗-
algebras that is also u.c.p. Then φ is a ∗-isomorphism.
Proof. First suppose that v ∈ B is a unitary and let u := φ−1(v). We then
have

1 = φ(u)∗φ(u) ≤ φ(u∗u) ≤ φ(1) = 1,

so φ(1 − u∗u) = 0. Since φ is injective, we see that u∗u = 1. Similarly, we
have

1 = φ(u)φ(u)∗ = φ(u∗)∗φ(u∗) ≤ φ(uu∗) ≤ φ(1) = 1,

whence we can likewise conclude that uu∗ = 1 and hence u is a unitary of
A.

Now ﬁx x, y ∈ A with kxk,kyk ≤ 1. Since kφ(x)k,kφ(y)k ≤ 1 as well,
