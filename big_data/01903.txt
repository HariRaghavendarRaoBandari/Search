Approximate but Accurate Quantum Dynamics from the Mori Formalism: I.
Nonequilibrium Dynamics

(Dated: 8 March 2016)

We present a formalism that explicitly uniﬁes the commonly used Nakajima-Zwanzig approach for reduced density
matrix dynamics with the more versatile Mori theory in the context of nonequilibrium dynamics. Employing a Dyson-
type expansion to circumvent the diﬃculty of projected dynamics, we obtain a self-consistent equation for the memory
kernel which requires only knowledge of normally evolved auxiliary kernels. To illustrate the properties of the current
approach, we focus on the spin-boson model and limit our attention to the use of a simple and inexpensive quasi-
classical dynamics, given by the Ehrenfest method, for the calculation of the auxiliary kernels. For the ﬁrst time, we
provide a detailed analysis of the dependence of the properties of the memory kernels obtained via diﬀerent projection
operators, namely the thermal (Redﬁeld-type) and population based (NIBA-type) projection operators. We further elu-
cidate the conditions that lead to short-lived memory kernels and the regions of parameter space to which this program
is best suited. Via a thorough analysis of the diﬀerent closures available for the auxiliary kernels and the convergence
properties of the self-consistently extracted memory kernel, we identify the mechanisms whereby the current approach
leads to a signiﬁcant improvement over the direct usage of standard semi- and quasi-classical dynamics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The continued eﬀort to develop accurate and eﬃcient ap-
proaches for the calculation of the dynamics of many-body
quantum systems has produced a rich variety of methods,
ranging from the numerically exact to the approximate. While
exact methods provide important benchmark results for model
systems,1–8 their computational cost makes them impractical
for realistic multidimensional systems. Conversely, approx-
imate methods, whether perturbative9–11 or based on quasi-
12–16 or semi-classical17–23 approaches, tend to scale more
gracefully with system size and can address both model and
realistic systems, albeit at the expense of general applicability
and accuracy. For cases where one is interested in the dynam-
ics of a limited number of degrees of freedom, the Nakajima-
Zwanzig (NZ) equation24,25 provides a useful starting point
for a plethora of methods based on generalized quantum mas-
ter equations (GQME).

The NZ equation, which may be derived via the projection
operator technique,26,27 dictates the evolution of the reduced
density matrix (RDM) for the portion of the Hilbert space
denoted as the system. The inﬂuence of the complementary
subspace, referred to as the bath, on the RDM dynamics ap-
pears in the form of a memory term, full knowledge of which
is tantamount to solving the original problem. The apparent
simplicity of the NZ equation, however, belies the complexity
of the memory term, which can be formidably diﬃcult if not
impossible to calculate exactly. Despite the seeming conser-
vation of diﬃculty, diﬀerent treatments of the memory kernel
have led to manageable and often very successful approximate
and numerically exact schemes.9–11,28–30

A major diﬃculty in the calculation of the memory ker-
nel lies in the fact that its dynamical evolution involves the
“projected” propagator, ei(1−P)Lt, where P is the projector that

a)Electronic mail: am3720@columbia.edu

deﬁnes the reduced dynamics. To circumvent the problem
of projected dynamics, Shi and Geva31–33 proposed a self-
consistent expansion of the memory kernel, which requires the
calculation of auxiliary kernels evolved with the normal rather
than the projected propagator. From an exact perspective, this
approach is useful only if the numerical eﬀort necessary for
the calculation of the auxiliary memory kernels is less than
that required for the direct calculation of the system dynam-
ics. Using the numerically exact quasi-adiabatic path integral
(QUAPI) method,2,3 Shi and Geva have shown that the mem-
ory kernel for the spin-boson model can decay up to 10 times
faster than the system dynamics,31 lending credence to the fea-
sibility of the self-consistent approach. More recently, a sim-
ilar scheme has been used by Rabani and co-workers within
a path integral framework for the study of quantum transport
problems.34–38 Just as importantly, applications of the method
have successfully used semi- and quasi-classical theories to
calculate the auxiliary kernels.32 In particular, Kelly, Mark-
land, and coworkers have illustrated the impressive accuracy
and robustness of this approach in both model and realistic
problems.39–41 These studies have led to two important con-
clusions: (i) the memory kernels are short-lived in a wide re-
gion of parameter space for canonical problems such as the
spin-boson model and (ii) the self-consistent solution of the
memory kernel using approximate dynamics can yield im-
pressively more accurate results than direct simulation of the
RDM dynamics using the very same approximate method.

Despite these important results, questions of general appli-
cability still remain. For instance, the conditions that lead
to short-lived memory kernels remain unknown. Further, it
is still unclear how the breakdown of approximate methods
(in unfavorable parameter regimes) aﬀects the quality of the
self-consistently extracted memory function. Perhaps most
importantly, an understanding of the necessary and suﬃcient
conditions from which the improvement in the accuracy of ap-
proximate dynamics from use in conjunction with the memory
function formalism as observed in Refs. 32, 39, and 40 is lack-
ing. Finally, the convergence properties of diﬀerent versions

of the auxiliary memory kernels arising from the alternative
closures in the self-consistent expansion of the memory func-
tion have not yet been explored. We expect these convergence
properties to diﬀer when approximate methods are employed
in the calculation of the auxiliary kernels.

The remarkable utility of the NZ equation notwithstanding,
objects beyond single-time nonequilibrium dynamics are ei-
ther cumbersome to obtain within this framework. Despite
this diﬃculty, recent work has generalized the NZ equation to
multi-time correlation functions.42 In contrast, the more ﬂex-
ible Mori formulation permits direct extension to multiple-
time and equilibrium correlation functions, which are essen-
tial in the treatment of linear43 and non-linear spectroscopy,44
and the calculation of chemical rate constants21,45 and kinetic
coeﬃcients,46 to name a few examples. For this reason, in pa-
per I (this paper) of this series, we provide a uniﬁed Mori-type
framework to approach single-time nonequilibrium correla-
tion functions, and address several of the open questions listed
above. In a second paper, we present the a similar framework
to treat equilibrium correlation functions. It should be noted
that a major advantage of the Mori formulation is that it can
naturally address problems where no system-bath distinction
exists, such as spin and fermion lattice models,47–49 and quan-
tum ﬂuids.50–53

The structure of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we
present the formalism for nonequilibrium correlation func-
tions from the Mori perspective and show that, with the appro-
priate choice of projection operator, one recovers equations
identical to those arising from the conventional NZ treatment.
Sec. II introduces the spin-boson model and the proposes two
types of projection operators for this model. Sec. III discusses
diﬀerent closures of the memory kernel based on diﬀerent
placements of the Q = 1−P projection operator and on the use
of time derivatives. To illustrate the arguments related to con-
vergence, we implement the mean ﬁeld Ehrenfest method, as
ﬁrst proposed in Ref. 40, to obtain the auxiliary memory ker-
nels. We henceforth refer to the use of the Ehrenfest method
coupled to the self-consistent extraction of the memory ker-
nels as the GQME+MFT approach. In the Sec. IV, show the
diﬀerent properties of the memory kernels associated with the
Redﬁeld- and NIBA-type projectors, explore the performance
of the GQME+MFT approach to SB models whose system-
bath coupling is characterized by Ohmic and Debye spectral
densities, and investigate the convergence properties of the
distinct closures introduced in Sec. III. In Sec. V, we con-
clude.

II. MORI APPROACH

For illustrative purposes, we focus on the spin-boson (SB)
Hamiltonian, which is representative of typical open quantum
systems, but note that the current approach is general and may
be applied to any Hamiltonian.54 In particular, a major ad-
vantage of the Mori formalism developed here over the tra-
ditional NZ approach is the ability to treat systems with no
natural system-bath separation, such as spin-chains and lat-
tice models47–49 or liquids.50–53 We reserve these applications

2

for later work.

The SB Hamiltonian takes the form H = HS + HB + V.
It contains a system part consisting of two sites oﬀset by an
energy bias 2ε and with oﬀ-diagonal coupling ∆, which is as-
sumed to be independent of the bath coordinates,

HS = εσz + ∆σx,

(1)

where σi corresponds to the ith Pauli matrix. The bath part of
the Hamiltonian consists of independent harmonic oscillators,

HB =

2 Xk h ˆP2

k

+ ω2
k

ˆQ2
ki,

(2)

where Pk and Qk are the mass weighted momenta and coordi-
nates for the kth harmonic oscillator, respectively, and ωk is the
frequency of the kth mode. The coupling between the system
and bath is assumed to be linear in the bath coordinates and
diagonal and antisymmetric with respect to the system basis,

V = ασzXk

ck ˆQk,

(3)

where ck is the coupling constant between the system and
the kth oscillator, and α = ±1 depending on the deﬁnition of
the model. The spectral density, J(ω), fully characterizes the
system-bath interaction, and takes the form,

J(ω) = α2Xk

c2
k

δ(ω − ωk).

(4)

It is common to assume one of several forms for the spec-
tral density. Two important cases describe Ohmic dissipation
in condensed phase systems where J(ω) is proportional to ω
as ω → 0. These are the standard Ohmic spectral density11
characterized by an exponential cutoﬀ, and the Debye spec-
tral density characterized by a Lorentzian cutoﬀ:

JOh(ω) = ξωe−ω/ωc ,

zation energy, λ = π−1R ∞

where the cutoﬀ frequency ωc determines the correlation time
of the bath at suﬃciently high temperatures.55 The reorgani-
0 dω J(ω)/ω, is a measure of the
strength of the system-bath coupling. In the case of the Ohmic
spectral density, the Kondo parameter, ξ = πλ/ωc, is often
used instead to gauge the coupling strength.

To assess the applicability of the formalism presented here,
we compare our results to exact nonequilibrium population
dynamics of the SB model,

hσz(t)i = Tr[σz(t) |1i h1| ρB],

(7)

where ρB = e−βHB /TrB[e−βHB] is the equilibrium density oper-
ator for the uncoupled bath, β = [kBT ]−1 is the inverse ther-
mal energy, and the initial condition |1i h1| ρB corresponds to
a Frank-Condon transition.

A. Generalized Nakajima-Zwanzig-Mori Equation

Here, we deviate from the derivations commonly given for
the NZ equation or the Mori equation of motion (EOM) for an
operator and instead focus on a generalized EOM for the full
propagator,

d
dt

eiLt = ieiLtPL + iQeiLQtL

−Z t

0

dτ eiL(t−τ)PLQeiLQτL

(8)

where P is the projection operator that deﬁnes the subsystem
whose dynamics we seek and Q = 1 − P is the complementary
projection operator. This equation is general and can be em-
ployed within both the NZ and Mori approaches. For instance,
applying Eq. (8) on an operator ˆA, yields the Mori EOM for
that operator. Conversely, taking the Hermitian conjugate of
Eq. (8), applying it on the initial density of the system and
bath, ρ0, and acting the projection operator P from the left
followed by a trace over the bath degrees of freedom yields
the NZ equation for the system’s RDM.

Essentially all work on the self-consistent expansion of the
memory kernel has employed the thermal (Argyres-Kelley)
projection operator P = RBTrB[...],31–35,39,40 where RB is a
bath operator with unit trace and TrB[...] corresponds to partial
trace over the bath. To use the Mori formulation, it is conve-
nient to rewrite the thermal projector, in the Heisenberg pic-

ture using Liouville notation,56 as P = Pi |AiiihhRBiAi|, where

{Ai} contains all outer product states spanning the system. For
the spin-boson model, Ai ∈ {|1i h1| , |2i h1| , |1i h2| , |2i h2|}.

Using the thermal type projector, applying Eq. (8) to |Akii,
and closing on the left with hhR′
B j is again a
bath operator with unit trace that may be diﬀerent from RB j in
the projection operator, yields the following set of EOMs for
system observables,

B jA j|, where R′

term. The elements of the memory kernel are given by,

B j)†A†

K jk(t) = hhRB jA j| LQeiQLtQL |Akii.

(10)

When R′
= RB j, the inhomogeneous term disappears, I(t) =
B j
0. Often, RB j = RB j/TrB[RB j] is chosen such that RB j ∈
{e−βHB , e−β(HB±Pk ck ˆQk)}, which correspond to the harmonic os-
cillator bath at equilibrium with the ground electronic state or
with one of the two excited states, respectively. Initial condi-
tions of the form ρ(0) = ρS (0)RBi, where ρS (0) is an arbitrary
system operator and RBi is taken from the set above, corre-
spond either to a Frank-Condon excitation where the bath is
in the electronic ground state also called the spectroscopic ini-
tial condition, or a charge transfer initial condition where the
bath is in equilibrium with one of the excited states.

3

We henceforth refer to the thermal projector above with
the additional restriction that RBi = exp[−βHB] as Redﬁeld-
type.9,10 The reason for this name is that truncation of the
memory kernel at second order in Q is equivalent to a second-
order perturbative expansion of the memory kernel with re-
spect to the system-bath coupling, which corresponds to Red-
ﬁeld theory. We further note that the choice for R′
B,i remains
ﬂexible.

An important alternative for the projection operator consists
of restricting the set {Ai} to the system populations Bi = |ii hi|,

and choosing RBi = exp[−β(HB + (−1)iPk ck ˆQk)]. When us-

ing this projection operator, a similar second-order truncation
of the memory kernel with respect to Q leads to equations
that are equivalent to the non-interacting blip approximation
(NIBA), which is a second order expansion in the electronic
coupling ∆ as opposed to the system-bath coupling.11,57 Ac-
cordingly, we hereafter refer to this projector as NIBA-type.
As in the case of the Redﬁeld-type projector, the choice for
B,i determines whether the inhomogeneous term is zero or
R′
ﬁnite.

III. SELF-CONSISTENT EXPANSIONS FOR K(t)

As mentioned in Sec. I, the main diﬃculty associated with
the memory kernel, Eq. (10), is the presence of the projected
propagator, eiLQt. To circumvent this problem, Shi and Geva
proposed the use of the Dyson identity,

e(A+B)t = eAt +Z t
= eAt +Z t

0

0

ds eAsBe(A+B)(t−s)

ds e(A+B)sBeA(t−s),

(11)

(12)

yielding a self-consistent expansion of the memory kernel that
only involves unprojected dynamics.31,33 Not surprisingly,
Eq. (8) can also be derived using the Dyson identity, Eqs. (11)
and (12). Despite considering only time-independent Hamil-
tonians in this work, extension of the formalism to time-
dependent Hamiltonians is simple and only requires the time-
ordered form for the propagators in Eqs. (11) and (12).

It is important to remark that in the literature, diﬀerent vari-
ants of the Dyson expansion have led to a menagerie of seem-
ingly distinct expressions, which diﬀer with respect to the
number of and type of auxiliary kernels employed.33 When
these distinct expressions are evaluated via exact methods, all
expansions yield equivalent results, up to numerical errors.
However, when the auxiliary kernels are computed via ap-
proximate methods, diﬀerent expansions can lead to memory
kernels with diﬀerent properties. In the following, we show
that there is only a limited number of integral equation forms
that can yield numerically distinct approximate memory ker-
nels from the self-consistent solution of the resulting integral
equations.

A. Bare expansions: Backward and Forward Q

The expansion of the memory kernel, Eq. (10), takes the

following form,

K(t) = K (1)(t) +Z t

0

dτ K (3b)(t − τ)K(τ),

(13)

where the superscript b refers to the placement of the Q in
the projected propagator as “backward” with respect to the
placement of the Liouvillian, i.e., eiQLt. The auxiliary memory
kernels take the forms

[K (1)(t)] jk = hhRB jA j| LQeiLtQL |Akii,
[K (3b)(t)] jk = −i hhRB jA j| LQeiLt |Akii.

(14)
(15)

A seemingly distinct type of closure that is commonly used
in the literature involves a third auxiliary memory kernel. In
Appendix B, we show that the three-member expansions are
equivalent to the two-member expansions given by Eqs. (13)
and (16). We further note that the auxiliary kernels we obtain
are equivalent to those used by others in the ﬁeld.31,39,40

A second set of closures makes use of the identity eiQLtQ =
QeiLQt. To indicate that the Q is to the right of the Liouvillian
L in the propagator, we have used the superscript f (indicat-
ing a “forward” placement). Inserting the previous identity in
Eq. (10) leads to the following expansion upon insertion of the
Dyson identity,

K(t) = K (1)(t) +Z t

0

dτ K(t − τ)K (3 f )(τ).

(16)

We note that K (1)(t) has the form given in Eq. (14), and
K (3 f )(t) has the following form,

[K (3 f )(t)] jk = −i hhRB jA j| eiLtQL |Akii.

(17)

It bears remarking that Eqs. (16) and (13) diﬀer in the place-
ment of K(t) under the integral and Eqs. (17) and (15) diﬀer in
whether QL or its Hermitian conjugate act on operators that
require sampling only at t = 0 or at ﬁnite times.

B. Expansions using time-derivatives

Because the auxiliary kernels given by Eqs. (14) and (15) or
(17) require sampling of additional bath operators at t = 0 and
at ﬁnite times, convergence of these functions, at least within
the context of semi- and quasi-classical methods, necessitates
the sampling of a larger number of bath realizations than for
the direct simulation of C(t), making the initial step of the
calculation more expensive, even if trivially parallelizable. To
avoid this added complexity and expense, the expressions for
the auxiliary kernels can be rewritten as time derivatives of
simpler correlation functions, including C(t) itself.
Indeed,
this observation has been made in recent work.34–38,58

Here we focus on three types of auxiliary memory kernels
that exploit diﬀerent placements of the time-derivative. The

ﬁrst type replaces the Liouvillian acting on operators that re-

(18)

(19)

(20)

The second type focuses on replacing the Liouvillian oper-
ating on static operators with the time derivative, yielding the
following expressions,

(26)

It should be noted that Eqs. (18)–(26) are exact identities in
the context of exact quantum dynamics but may yield diﬀerent
results when approximate quantum dynamics are employed.

For clarity in the subsequent discussion, we henceforth re-
fer to the diﬀerent closures via abbreviations of the form c(xy),
where x ∈ {f(orward), b(ackward)}, and y ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3} where
0 denotes the bare expansion and 1, 2, 3 the three types of
expansion in the present section. For example, the cb2 clo-
sure refers to the use of Eqs. (21) and (22) to solve for K(t) in
Eq. 13.

IV. RESULTS

The recent success achieved in using semi- and quasi-
classical schemes to calculate the auxiliary kernels required in
the self-consistent extraction of memory kernels underscores
the importance of understanding the properties of this pro-
gram in more detail. Consequently, we employ a simple quasi-
classical method, namely Ehrenfest dynamics,16,59 to obtain
the auxiliary memory kernels and study the performance of
the Redﬁeld- and NIBA-type projectors and of the diﬀerent
closures available for the kernels. The procedural steps we
follow can be summarized as follows:

1. Calculate the various auxiliary kernels via a dynami-
cal method of choice. Here, we use the approximate
Ehrefest approach.

2. Solve Eqs. (13) or (16) iteratively until the relative error

becomes negligible. Our threshold is 10−10.

3. Numerically integrate Eq. (9) subject to the appropriate

order Runge-Kutta algorithm.

The memory kernel decays to zero for a large sections of
parameter space for the SB and other impurity-type models.60
We refer to the timescale that determines this decay as the
memory lifetime. As mentioned in the Introduction, the com-
putational eﬃciency of the memory function approach de-
pends sensitively on this lifetime.

When approximate methods, such as semi- and quasi-
classical schemes, are used to calculate the auxiliary kernels,
the extracted memory function can accrue errors that are ex-
pected to grow with increasing simulation time. Hence, the
decay of the memory kernel may not be accurately captured
by these methods. Previous applications of the memory func-
tion approach have implemented a cutoﬀ time for the mem-
ory kernel, after which all its components are set to zero.
Sensitivity of the results to this cutoﬀ time will be discussed
in Sec. IV C. For all results showing only one GQME+MFT
curve, the cutoﬀ time, τc, was chosen at the point where the
extracted C(t) dynamics reached a plateau of stability. For
a more thorough discussion of the Ehrenfest method and its
implementation for obtaining the auxiliary kernels, see Ap-
pendices C and D.

A. Projection Operators

In this section, we restrict our attention to the Ohmic spec-
tral density, a model whose performance has already been
studied extensively using the Redﬁeld-type projection oper-
ator and closure scheme cb0 by Kelly, Markland, and co-
workers.40 The purpose of this section is mainly to provide an
analysis of the NIBA-type memory kernels and show the via-
bility of the GQME+MFT approach using both the Redﬁeld-
and NIBA-type projectors. Here and in Sec. IV B, we show
results only for the cb1 closure, and postpone the discussion
of the closure dependence of the results to Sec. IV C.

We ﬁrst compare the diﬀerent properties of the Redﬁeld-
and NIBA-type memory kernels for a realization of the biased
(ε = 1) spin-boson model characterized by weak system-bath
coupling (ξ = 0.1), low temperature (β = 5.0), and a moder-
ately fast bath (ωc = 2.5). Fig. 1 shows a representative set
of components of the Redﬁeld-type memory kernel, Kx2(t), in
panels (a)-(d), and all components of the NIBA-type memory
kernel K(t) in panels (e)-(f). Comparison of the two types
of type memory kernel reveals the diﬀerent timescales asso-
ciated with their decay. Although seemingly noisy at longer
times, the Redﬁeld-type memory kernel has a short lifetime
(τc ∼ 2), while the NIBA-type memory kernel decays much
more slowly, (τc > 15).

Fig. 2 illustrates the dynamics for the parameters used in
Fig. 1. Despite capturing the correct oscillation frequency
and amplitude decay, the Ehrenfest dynamics (green dashes)
fails to capture the long-time limit of the populations. Indeed,
because of the assumption of a classical bath, the Ehrenfest
method is known to violate detailed balance.61 Instead, the
dynamics resulting from both the Redﬁeld- and NIBA-type

properties of a massive particle suspended in a bath of lighter
particles, relies on the separation of timescales for the dy-
namics of the heavy and light particles. This separation of
timescales is made eﬀective via the projection operator, which
must be chosen such that it contains all slow variables asso-
ciated with the massive particle. Appropriate inclusion of all
slow variables in the projector ensures that the memory ker-
nel decays on a shorter timescale than the system dynamics.63
The Redﬁeld-type projector spans the entire Hilbert space of
the system, whereas the NIBA-type projector excludes pro-
jections onto coherences, |ii h j| where i , j. While coher-
ences often decay faster than populations, their decay is often
slower than bath correlations, as long as the bath dimension-
ality is large. Hence, the slower time-scale associated with the
decay of the coherences induces the slow decay of the NIBA-
type memory kernels. This conclusion further suggests that
the NIBA-type projector may be most useful in instances of
fast system relaxation, such as strong system-bath coupling
cases at high temperatures.

It has been suggested that the success of the memory
function program, where the auxiliary kernels are calculated
via semi- and quasi-classical schemes like Ehrenfest mean-
ﬁeld theory,40 the momentum-jump solution to the quantum-
classical Liouville equation,39 and the linearized semiclassi-
cal initial value representation (LSC-IVR) scheme,64 relies
primarily on the conﬂuence of two important factors. First,
the memory kernels are short-lived in comparison to the de-
sired system dynamics. Second, approaches based on semi-
classical arguments are more accurate at short times. Consid-
ered in tandem, these factors imply that the present scheme
can lead to highly accurate short-time memory kernels, thus

avoiding problems associated with the long-time dynamics
produced by these approximate methods by virtue of fast
memory decay. However, the ability of the slowly decaying
NIBA-type memory kernel to nearly recover the exact dy-
namics raises an important question: given the long lifetime
of the NIBA-type kernel, how can it remain suﬃciently ac-
curate at long times to correct the long-time behavior of the
bare quasi-classical dynamics? To answer this question, it
is necessary to scrutinize the form of the auxiliary kernels.
The NIBA-type auxiliary kernels for closure cb1 include two
types of correlation functions, q(00)
nm (t) and q(10a)
nm (t) given by
Eqs. (B1) and (B4). Clearly, q(00)
nm (t) is the Ehrenfest ver-
sion of C(t), while q(10a)
nm (t) involves a new type of correla-
tor that requires the sampling of an additional bath operator,

ζW = −αP j c jP j tanh(βω j/2)/ω j, at t = 0. At this point, two

possible reasons for the improvement aﬀorded by the NIBA-
type approach seem likely. First, it may be that the Ehrenfest
method describes the the dynamics of coherences, which are
required as input in the auxiliary kernels, better than those of
populations. Second, q(10a)
nm (t) contains exact sampling of the
bath operator ζW at t = 0, which may encapsulate important
information about the system-bath interaction. With the in-
formation above, however, it is diﬃcult to decide on which
hypothesis is more likely. We return to this discussion in
Sec. IV C. The previous questions notwithstanding, the abil-
ity of the long-lived NIBA-type memory kernel to produce
dynamics that are comparably accurate to those obtained via
the Redﬁeld-type approach underscores the fact that a rapidly
decaying memory function is not required for the success of
the GQME+MFT approach.

Fig. 3 provides a more thorough test of the performance
of the NIBA-type projector. Here we compare the NIBA-
type GQME+MFT dynamics to exact results for the cases ad-
dressed by Kelly et al.40 in their recent work characterizing
the performance of the Redﬁeld-type GQME+MFT approach.
For convenience, we include the results from the Redﬁeld-
type projector as well. We further remark that the focus of
these cases is the performance of the present approach to bi-
ased systems coupled weakly (λ = πξ/ωc < 1) to a bath char-
acterized by varying timescales, evident in the range of ωc. As
is clear from Fig. 3, direct use of the Ehrenfest MFT method
consistently leads to incorrect long-time values of the popu-
lation diﬀerence. In agreement with the work of Kelly and
co-workers,40 the Redﬁeld-type GQME+MFT method quan-
titatively corrects the dynamics in all considered cases. The
NIBA-type approach generally provides clear improvement
over direct use of MFT, but is slightly less accurate than the
Redﬁeld-type GQME+MFT. Regardless, the improvement of
the dynamics produced by the NIBA-type projector is remark-
able not just because of the fact that the memory function is
long-lived, but also because such an approach is not tailored
for the weak system-bath coupling limit as is the Redﬁeld-type
projector where the benchmark calculations of Fig. 3 have
been performed.

els (a)–(d) correspond to the real (solid) and imaginary (dashed) parts of the
Redﬁeld-type memory kernel elements Kx2(t). Panels (e)-(f) display all com-
ponents of the NIBA-type memory kernel.

B. Debye Spectral Density

Due to its slower decay at large frequencies, the Debye
spectral density is generally considered a more challenging
case for trajectory-based dynamical methods.65 Here we show
that the conclusions drawn from the Ohmic case, namely that
the GQME+MFT method can signiﬁcantly improve the prob-
lematic MFT dynamics for weakly coupled, biased systems at
low temperatures, are similarly applicable to the Debye case.
A few diﬀerences are worth mentioning, chief among them
that the highly oscillatory nature of the Redﬁeld-type memory
kernels for this spectral density generally means that a larger
number of trajectories to achieve convergence are required.

Panels (a)-(d) of Fig. 4 show the components Kx2(t) for
the Redﬁeld-type memory kernel, while panels (e)-(f) show
all components of the NIBA-type memory kernel. While the
NIBA-type memory kernels do not show any obvious diﬀer-
ences from their Ohmic counterparts, the Redﬁeld-type mem-
ory kernel displays recurrent beating alongside overall de-
cay. The presence of this much stronger oscillatory behav-
ior requires that the dynamics of high frequency modes in the
Ehrenfest procedure be treated more accurately than is neces-
sary in the Ohmic case. We discuss this issue in more depth in
the next section, where we explore the convergence properties
of the diﬀerence closures.

Fig. 5 presents some illustrative examples of the capabil-
ity of the GQME+MFT approach to yield accurate dynam-
ics for the biased SB model at low temperatures, over a

ased case characterized by weak system-bath coupling at low
temperature (β = 50.0) and an intermediate bath frequency
(ωc = 1.0), shows nearly perfect agreement between the
Ehrenfest and exact dynamics. Both the Redﬁeld- and NIBA-
type GQME+MFT approaches are able to recover the remark-
able agreement between the Ehrenfest and exact dynamics.
Panels (b)-(d) correspond to biased cases, spanning a wide
range of bath frequencies (ωc = 0.25, 5.0) and temperatures
(β =0.5, 50.0). As expected, the bare Ehrenfest method leads
to incorrect long-time limits for all three biased cases. As in
the Ohmic case, both the Redﬁeld- and NIBA-type approaches
yield results in almost quantitative agreement with the exact
dynamics. Slight deviations are evident, as in panel (b), where
the NIBA-type GQME slightly underestimates the long-time
limit of the population diﬀerence. Perhaps the most diﬃcult
case for the current approach, panel (d), shows that the NIBA-
type GQME+MFT treatment leads to overly damped oscilla-
tions at long times, whereas the Redﬁeld-type approach yields
results in near quantitative agreement with the exact dynam-
ics. In short, the results in Fig. 5 illustrate the robustness of
the approach for weak-coupling cases over a wide range of
bath frequencies and temperatures.

C. Memory Kernel Closures and Dynamics

In Sec.

III, we introduced eight diﬀerent closures of the
memory kernels. These include two subsets consisting of the
Q-forward and Q-backward closures, which are further subdi-
vided into the bare expansion (c f 0 and cb0) and three expan-
sions that use numerical derivatives of the simulated correla-

tion functions, (c f 1–c f 3 and cb1–cb3). While the resulting
dynamics do not diﬀer when the auxiliary kernels are calcu-
lated via exact methods, the same claim is not necessarily true
when using approximate dynamics. Here, we continue to use
the Ehrenfest method to illustrate the sensitivity of the results
that occur across the spectrum of closures.

To inform the discussion on the properties of diﬀerent clo-
sures of either the Redﬁeld- or NIBA-type memory kernels,
we ﬁrst provide an overview of the underlying types of cor-
relation functions that are employed in the calculation of the
auxiliary kernels. These are summarized in Eqs. (B1)–(B6)
of Appendix B. For convenience, we reproduce these expres-
sions, within the Ehfenfest approximation, below,

system-bath interaction via statically sampled bath operator,
ζW, that facilitate the improvement over the bare Ehrenfest
dynamics aﬀorded by the memory function approach.

A distinct source of error that may aﬀect the accuracy of
closures that implement numerical time-derivatives lies in the
accuracy of the time-derivatives themselves. If the correla-
tion functions calculated via the Ehrenfest procedure are suf-
ﬁciently smooth and well converged and the time-step is suﬃ-
ciently small, this error can be expected to be minimal. How-
ever, correlation functions containing bath operators that re-
quire sampling at ﬁnite times tend to be highly oscillatory,
especially for fast baths, which may lead to less accurate re-
sults.

Armed with these considerations, it is possible to explore
the diﬀerences associated with the diﬀerent closures of the
auxiliary kernels. Because the Redﬁeld- and the NIBA-type
projectors require diﬀerent combinations of the aforemen-
tioned correlators, Eqs. (27)–(32), as input for their auxiliary
kernels, we discuss the behaviors of the diﬀerent closures for
the two projectors separately.

Focusing ﬁrst on the Redﬁeld-type kernel closures, we as-
sess the eﬀect of the Q-backward and Q-forward approaches
by focusing ﬁrst on the cb0 and c f 0 closures.
Inspection
of Eqs.
(15) and (17) reveals that the only diﬀerence be-
tween the Q-forward and Q-backward closures lies in the fact
that K (3 f )(t) contains the time-evolved bath operator VW
B (t),
whereas K (3b)(t) requires sampling of the static bath opera-
tor, VW
B (0). Consistent with the above discussion, we may
expect that the c f 0 closure will lead to less accurate results
than cb0. As Fig. 6 shows, the diﬀerence between the two
closures is minimal. To understand the smallness of the dif-
ference between these two closures, it is suﬃcient to consider
that, while each closure has a diﬀerent form for K (3)(t), both
closures share the same form for K (1)(t), which requires the
sampling of bath operators both at t = 0 and at ﬁnite times.
Hence, any error associated with the explicit inclusion of time
evolved bath operators would aﬀect both closures, cb0 and
c f 0, and any beneﬁt derived from the exclusive sampling of
t = 0 bath operators is also maintained in the form for K (1)(t).
Further, the similarity in performance of the cb0 and c f 0 clo-
sures indicates that the error associated with the dynamical

Inspection of Eqs. (27)–(32) reveals that there are two main
those that re-
types of functions containing bath operators:
quire their sampling exclusively at t = 0 [Eqs.
(27), (29)
and (30)], and those containing both statically and dynami-
cally sampled bath operators [Eq. (28), (31), and (32)]. We
recall the important fact that at t = 0, the Ehrenfest method is
exact and the accuracy of the method diminishes with increas-
ing simulation time.66 What is not clear, however, is whether
the accuracy associated with the dynamical sampling of a sin-
gle system operator is the same as that of a product of system
and bath operators, as is required in Eqs. (28), (31), and (32).
Because the bath is treated classically, dynamical sampling of
bath operators may indeed accrue larger errors. Since the clas-
sical approximation is most problematic for high frequency
modes, this problem may be exacerbated by fast baths charac-
terized by broad spectral densities, namely the Debye spectral
density. Instead, when bath operators are sampled statically,
as is the case in Eqs. (27), (29), and (30), the t = 0 weighting
of trajectories of the correlation functions is captured exactly.
One may also distinguish the correlation functions above on
the basis of sampling of distinct bath operators not normally
included, whether explicitly or implicitly, in C(t). Naively,
one may suppose that Eqs. (28)–(32) contain information dis-
tinct from that in contained in C(t), but the Ehrenfest evolution
algorithm requires sampling of VW
B (t), which contributes a dy-
namic component to the system’s bias energy ε 7→ ε + VW
B (t).
Consequently, only Eqs. (30) and (32), which sample ζW, con-
tain distinct information about the system which is not already
included in the calculation of C(t).
Indeed, these correla-
tion functions may contain additional information about the

sampling of products of system and bath operators is often
similar to the error associated with the exclusive sampling
of system operators. Because the diﬀerence between the re-
sults of the Q-forward and Q-backward closures is small, we
henceforth exclusively address the diﬀerences among the Q-
backward closures, cb0, cb1, cb2, and cb3.

Consideration of the remaining three Q-backward closures,
cb1, cb2, and cb3, likewise requires close scrutiny of the types
of correlation functions that are used in each. First we note
that, while the form of K (3b)(t) in the cb0 closure avoids the
sampling of bath operators at ﬁnite time, K (1)(t) still samples
bath operators at ﬁnite times. Instead, the cb1 closure com-
pletely avoids the sampling of bath operators at t , 0, while
still beneﬁting from sampling of static bath operators for both
auxiliary kernels. In contrast, the cb2 and cb3 closures ex-
plicitly avoid sampling of static bath operators, other than the
density operator for the bath. As is evident from panels (a)
and (b) in Fig. 7, the cb1 closure performs as well or better
than the cb0 closure. However, because the cb1 closure leads
to equations that are easier to converge and auxiliary kernels
that are easier to calculate, it should be preferred over the cb0
closure.

Inspection of panels (c) and (d) of the same ﬁgure shows
that the cb2 and cb3 essentially recover the bare Ehrenfest be-
havior. Thus, we have demonstrated the remarkable fact that
diﬀerent closures for the memory function, all of which are
exact when implemented with exact input, can yield markedly
diﬀerent results when combined with approximate dynami-
cal input. The analytical proof that, for example, the cb3
(and c f 3) closure must yield correlators that are identical to
the use of the bare input dynamics is provided in the com-

panion paper.67 Further, the fact that the cb2 closure also re-
covers the bare Ehrenfest dynamics clearly indicates that the
ﬁrst of the two criteria speciﬁed in Ref. 67 is satisﬁed by
the Ehrenfest method. Indeed, the numerical data show that
within the Ehrenfest approach the action of the Liouvillian
acting on a dynamically sampled operator is equivalent to the
numerical time-derivative of the analogous correlation func-
tion. In addition, given the violation of the second criterion
([LEh, (eiLt)Eh] , 0), it is not surprising that the cb0 and cb1
closures yield GQME dynamics that are distinct from the the
results of direct application of the Ehrenfest method. How-
ever, the violation of the second criterion does not explain the
reason for marked improvement in the dynamics aﬀorded by
the cb0 and cb1 closures. These results also lend additional
credence to the claim that the success of the GQME+MFT ap-
proach does not rely on the short-time accuracy of Ehrenfest
dynamics. Further, they illustrate that improvement within
the memory formalism over the bare quasi-classical theory
depends sensitively on the correlation functions calculated as
input for the auxiliary memory kernels. In Sec. IV A we sug-
gested that the Ehrenfest method might capture the dynam-
ics of coherences more accurately than that of the popula-

tions, and that the self-consistent extraction of the memory
kernel would include corrections to the population dynamics
aﬀorded by the ostensibly more accurate coherence dynam-
ics. However, the recovery of Ehrenfest dynamics by closures
cb2 and cb3, which also use the dynamics of coherences, im-
plies that this cannot be the root cause of the improvement
of dynamics within the memory function approach. Instead,
the more likely explanation is that the sampling of static bath
operators in Eqs. (29) and (31) contributes important infor-
mation about the system-bath interaction, which leads to far
greater accuracy in the extracted memory kernels themselves.
The diﬀerences in the dynamics resulting from the diﬀer-
ent closures are also evident in the extracted memory kernels.
Direct comparison of the Redﬁeld-type memory kernels for
cases characterized by the Debye spectral density fails to re-
veal much, since their highly oscillatory behavior obfuscates
subtle diﬀerences among the memory kernels obtained from
diﬀerent closures. However, the fast decay of the Ohmic spec-
tral density, which results in quickly decaying memory ker-
nels with minor oscillations, makes discerning qualitative and
quantitative diﬀerences between the extracted kernels possi-
ble. Fig. 8 compares a representative set of Redﬁeld-type ker-
nel elements arising from diﬀerent closures. As is clear from
the ﬁgure, all closures agree within numerical and sampling
error in their t = 0 values. However, the cb2 and cb3 closures
display a stronger oscillatory behavior, in contrast to the cb0
and cb1 closures, which correctly recover accurate dynamics
(see Fig. 2). We further note that the diﬀerence in behavior is
greatest at intermediate times.

The previous discussion suggests that the main factor lead-
ing to highly accurate memory kernels is the exact sampling

10

of speciﬁc static bath operators. A corollary question arises:
do all correlation functions with statically sampled bath oper-
ators lead to a similar improvement? After all, Eq. (28) sam-
ples VW
B (0) at t = 0, but its use in closure cb3 does not lead
to any improvement over the bare Ehrenfest dynamics. This
suggests either that the exact sampling of exclusively static
bath operators adds an important correction to the auxiliary
kernels, or that correlation functions that sample VW
B (0) are
not as important as those that sample ζW. The idea that ζW
is neither sampled explicitly nor implicitly (via the Ehrenfest
evolution protocol) in the calculation of C(t) provides some
support to the latter claim. It is also fair to ask whether one
can similarly beneﬁt from “improperly” Wigner-transformed
bath operator products sampled at t = 0. This question be-
comes particularly important when a functional form for the
density operator of the bath is either not available or challeng-
ing to obtain. To see the importance of properly including the
terms in the Wigner transformation, we take an approximate
form for the Wigner transform of the product ρBVB (deﬁned
in Appendix D). Our approximation truncates the Moyal ex-
pansion for the Wigner transform of a product of operators at
zeroth order in , neglecting the second term (containing ζW)
on the right side of Eq. (D5). Results for this approximation
are shown in Fig. 9. As is evident in the ﬁgure, the beneﬁts
in closures cb0 and cb1 that originally led to the quantitative
agreement between the GQME+MFT and exact dynamics are
eliminated. Instead, the ﬁnal result, while not unphysical, is
not better than the standard Ehrenfest result. Since the cb2 and
cb3 closures do not contain this neglected term, the results in
panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 9 are the same as those in panels (c)
and (d) of Fig. 7. This result underscores the importance of

FIG. 12. Comparison of population dynamics obtained from the Q-backward

the memory kernels. Exact results are obtained from Ref. 7.

proper sampling of all contributions arising from the Wigner
transform of operator products.

In comparison to the Redﬁeld-type closures, the NIBA-type
kernels only contain two types of correlation functions, q(00)(t)
and q(10a)(t). As mentioned in the discussion of the Redﬁeld-
type closures, q(00)(t) contains the same information as Ehren-
fest version of C(t), whereas q(10a)(t) contains exact informa-
tion about the system-bath interaction at t = 0. For this reason,
we expect the c0b and c1b closures to yield signiﬁcantly better
dynamics than the cb2 and cb3 closures, which should simply
recover the Ehrenfest dynamics.67 Indeed, as Fig. 10 shows,
the cb0 and cb1 closures are able to quantitatively correct the
Ehrenfest dynamics. In contrast to the Redﬁeld case, the cb0
and cb1 NIBA-type auxiliary kernels require the sampling of
the same bath operators, which explains the lack of diﬀerence
in the behaviors of the two closures.

Of paramount importance to the success of the memory ap-
proach is the ﬁnite lifetime of the memory kernel. For the
GQME+MFT implementation used here, we have chosen a
cutoﬀ time for the memory kernel, τc, which lies in a stability
plateau alluded to in Sec. IV. The range of the stability plateau
can depend sensitively on the regime of parameter space ex-
plored. Fig. 11 shows the dependence of the GQME+MFT
dynamics for the Redﬁeld- and NIBA-type projectors on the
speciﬁc value of τc used. Panels (a) and (b), corresponding to
a fast bath, high temperature, biased case, show the greatest
sensitivity of the GQME dynamics to the exact cutoﬀ time,
τc. In contrast, the results in panels (c) and (d), which cor-
respond to lower temperatures, are more stable. Despite the
slight sensitivity of the results on the choice of τc for the ex-
amples shown, the GQME dynamics are clearly robust. We

remark, however, that there are regions of parameter space for
which this stability plateau is short-lived or nonexistent. In
those cases, the present approach is clearly not appropriate.

Finally, we address the convergence properties of the
GQME dynamics with respect to the time-step of the memory
kernel and the GQME evolution algorithm. As Fig. 12 shows,
decreasing the time step used in the extraction of the memory
kernel can greatly alter the accuracy of the GQME dynam-
ics. The closures most sensitive to the time step are cb0 and
cb3 closures. The sensitivity of the cb3 closure to the time
step is not diﬃcult to understand, since for large dt the sec-
ond numerical time derivative becomes noisy, leading to the
growing oscillations in panel (d). Because closure cb0 shown
in panel (a) contains the correlation functions q(11s)(t) and
q(11a)(t), which require sampling of bath operators at t = 0 and
at ﬁnite times and are highly oscillatory functions, a smaller
time step is required to achieve suﬃciently accurate memory
kernels. It is important to note that, as stated before, the cb0
and cb1 closures, when fully converged with respect to bath
realizations and time step, yield identical results that greatly
improve the Ehrenfest results, while closures cb2 and cb3 are
only capable of recovering the Ehrenfest dynamics.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have developed a method to obtain the
nonequilibrium population and coherence dynamics based on
the Mori formalism. Our approach is general and, depend-
ing on the choice of projector, can treat arbitrary single-

time nonequilibrium populations and coherences as well as
more complicated dynamical objects, such as multi-time,
equilibrium and nonequilibrium correlation functions. We
have shown that use of the Redﬁeld-type projector recovers
the conventional NZ treatment previously used by Shi and
Geva31,33,64 and Kelly, Markland, and coworkers39–41 in the
context of the SB model, and Rabani and coworkers34–38 for
more general models.

While previous applications of the GQME+semi-classical
approach39,40,64 have been limited to the Redﬁeld-type pro-
jector and have focused on the improvement over the bare
semi-classical dynamics that the memory function formalism
can aﬀord, we have systematically explored the sensitivity of
the results to the choice of projector and the type of closure
employed. In doing so, we ﬁnd two important facts. First,
slowly decaying memory kernels, often observed when using
the NIBA-type projector, do not result in an inaccurate de-
scription of the GQME dynamics. This demonstrates that the
success of the GQME+semi-classical approach is not a func-
tion of the short-time accuracy of the approximate method
used to calculate the auxiliary kernels. Second, we identify
the types of closures that consistently lead to improvements
over the bare semi-classical dynamics (cb0, cb1, c f 0, and
c f 1) and attribute this improvement, in part, to the sampling
of static bath operators, ζW, which do not appear in the evalua-
tion of the approximate bare populations. Just as importantly,
we identify the types of closures that recover the Ehrenfest
dynamics (cb2, cb3, c f 2, and c f 3). Our ﬁndings also provide
numerical conﬁrmation of the analytical proof included in the
companion paper,67 which indicates that use of the cb3 and
c f 3 closures can only recover the level of dynamics used to
calculate the auxiliary kernels.

Finally, we remark that the Mori-based formulation fur-
thered in this work provides a ﬂexible framework to accu-
rately study problems that go beyond the scope of nonequi-
librium dynamics for SB-type models. For instance, the Mori
formalism can easily address equilibrium and multi-time cor-
relation functions in systems coupled to harmonic and anhar-
monic baths, as well as problems where the system-bath dis-
tinction is absent. Work in this latter direction will be pursued
in future papers.

Appendix A: Fourier-Laplace Analysis of Closures

We begin by introducing the Fourier-Laplace transform of

a time-dependent function f (t),

f (ω) = Z ∞

dteiωt f (t).

(A1)

Its ﬁrst and second time-derivatives take the following form,

dteiωt ˙f (t) = − f (0) + (−iω) f (ω),

(A2)

dteiωt ¨f (t) = − ˙f (0) − (−iω) f (0) + (−iω)2 f (ω).

(A3)

The kernel expansions in Eqs. (13) and (16) can be rewrit-

ten as follows,

K(ω) = [1 − K (3b)(ω)]−1K (1)(ω)
= K (1)(ω)[1 − K (3 f )(ω)]−1.

(A4)
(A5)

In their original paper, Shi and Geva31 derived the following

identity for the Redﬁeld-type (thermal) projector,

QLQ = Q(L − PLsb),
= (L − LsbP)Q,

(A6)
(A7)

where Lsb is the Liouvillian corresponding to the system-bath

interaction for the SB model V = ασzPk ck xk. The second

line is a simple extension of the derivation provided by Shi
and Geva. These identities allow for the exact rewriting of the
“Q-surrounded” projected propagator,

QeiQLtQ = Qei(L−PLsb)tQ
= Qei(L−LsbP)tQ.

(A8)
(A9)

Replacing these expressions for the projected propagator in
Eq. (10) followed by use of the Dyson decomposition leads to
the following three- rather than two-membered expansions,

K(t) = K (1)(t) +Z t
= K (1)(t) +Z t

propagator,

K (2 f )

nm (t) = −ihhρBAn| Lsbei(L−PLsb)t |Amii,
nm (t) = −ihhρBAn| ei(L−LsbP)tLsb |Amii.

(A12)

(A13)

In Fourier-Laplace space, the previous expressions for the
memory kernel become,

K(ω) = K (1)(ω) + K (2b)(ω)K (1)(ω),
= K (1)(ω) + K (1)(ω)K (2 f )(ω).

(A14)
(A15)

In the time-domain, the second auxiliary kernels may be

expanded as follows,

K (2x)(t) = K (3x)(t) +Z t
= K (3x)(t) +Z t

0

0

dτ K (2x)(t − τ)K (3x)(τ),

(A16)

dτ K (3x)(t − τ)K (2x)(τ),

(A17)

where x ∈ {b, f }. Transforming Eqs. (A16) and (A17), we
may solve for K (2x)(ω)

K (2x)(ω) = K (3x)(ω)[1 + K (3x)(ω)]−1,
= [1 + K (3x)(ω)]−1K (3x)(ω).

(A18)
(A19)

Substitution of Eqs. (A18) and (A19) into Eqs. (A14) and
(A15) for the Q-forward and Q-backward closures yields,

K(ω) = [1 − K (3b)(ω)]−1K (1)(ω)
= K (1)(ω)[1 − K (3 f )(ω)]−1,

(A20)
(A21)

which are clearly equivalent to Eqs. (A4) and (A5), implying
that the three-membered closures are equivalent to the two-
membered closures.

Appendix B: Expressions for Auxiliary Memory Kernels

Here we provide explicit expressions for the components of
the memory kernel using the Redﬁeld- and NIBA-type projec-
tion operators. Before going further, however, we introduce
for notational clarity the following correlation functions.

take the following forms,

We employ a notation where some indices are squared since
the q(t) functions are labelled using the indices corresponding
to the A j operators, which are related to the B j operators in
the following way: B1 7→ A1 = A12 and B2 7→ A4 = A22.

For the projector above to be truly of NIBA-type, K (1)(t)
should be O(∆2). Instead, K (1)(t) has contributions of ﬁrst and
second order in ∆. Indeed, the proper NIBA-type projector has
the following form,

Appendix C: Initial Conditions in the Ehrenfest method

In an open quantum system where a subsystem interacts
weakly with a heat bath, the Ehrenfest method12,13,16,59 treats
the subsystem quantum mechanically and the bath classically.
The validity of this approximation relies on two important as-
sumptions: correlations between the system and bath are neg-
ligible, and the characteristic energy of the bath is smaller than
the other energy scales in the problem, justifying the use of
classical mechanics for the evolution of the bath.

The Ehrenfest method has been derived from complemen-
tary wavefunction16 and density matrix formulations.59 Be-
cause of its clarity, the derivation based on the density ma-
trix and the quantum-classical Liouville equation has garnered
much attention in the last decade. The density matrix formu-
lation only requires that the subsystem and bath density matri-
ces have norms equal to unity. However, the lack of restriction
of the subsystem density matrix to pure states results in am-
biguities in its implementation. To illustrate the source of the
ambiguity, we focus on the following correlation function for
the spin-boson model

C(t) = Tr[RBσiσz(t)],

(C1)

[K (1)(t)]nm = [Xnq(11s)
[K (3b)(t)]nm = iXnq(10s)
[K (3 f )(t)]nm = iq(01)

nm (t)Xm,

nm (t) + iYnq(11a)
nm (t) − Ynq(10a)

nm (t)]Xm,
nm (t),

where Xn = 2(δn3 − δn2) and Yn = 2(δn1 − δn4).

Using the NIBA-type projector,

(B8)
(B9)
(B10)

where i ∈ {x, y}, and the bath initial condition has unit trace,
TrB[RB] = 1. This corresponds to a nonequilibrium initial
condition where the system is initially in a superposition of
coherences. Immediately it is clear that ρS (0) = σi has zero
norm. To remedy this, one may take advantage of the linearity
of the problem and rewrite Eq. (C1) into sums of correlation
functions with proper initial conditions,

trix based decompositions agree in their short- and long-time
limits, but disagree in their descriptions of intermediate-time
behavior. More importantly, all density matrix decomposi-
tions disagree with the wavefunction-based result. Panel (c)
shows the ability of the density matrix-based approach to re-
cover the wavefunction-based result when the initial condition
corresponds to a population rather than a coherence, but de-
composition B underscores the problems associated with the
lack of uniqueness in the density matrix based approach.

Appendix D: Ehrenfest Method: Correlation Functions

Unlike previous implementations of the Ehrenfest method,
we are interested in two time correlation functions rather than
nonequilibrium single quantity dynamics,

CAB(t) = Tr[AS (0)AB(0)BS (t)BB(t)],

(D1)

where XS (XB) is a generic system (bath) operator. Under the
quasi-classical approximation of Wigner dynamics, we may
rewrite the above correlation function as follows,

CAB(t) ≈ Z dΓ AW

B BW

B (t)TrS [AS (0)BS (t)],

(D2)

FIG. 13. Comparison of Ehrenfest dynamics resulting from the wavefunction-
and density matrix-based approaches.
In panels (a) and (b), DM 1 corre-
sponds to the following combination of initial conditions [|1i h1| + σi] −
[|1i h1|], DM 2 to [|2i h2| +σi]−[|2i h2|], and DM 3 to [0.5∗1S +σi]−[0.5∗1S ],
where i = x, y for panels (a) and (b), respectively. In panel (c), DM 1 corre-
sponds to [|1i h1| + σy] − [|1i h1|], and DM 2 to 2 ∗ [0.5 ∗ 1S ] − [|1i h1|].

where 1S = |1i h1| + |2i h2|.

Returning to the wavefunction-based derivation of the
Ehrenfest approach requires that any subsystem initial con-
dition correspond to a pure state. Referring again to Eq. (C1),
we may rewrite the trace over the subsystem in the eigenbasis
of the subsystem’s initial condition,

C(t) = Xi

λiTrB[RB hλi| σz(t) |λii].

(C5)

Although there are other ways of choosing a pure state so as to
evaluate the above correlation function, the wavefunction for-
mulation avoids the ambiguity fostered by the density matrix
derivation.

Fig. 13 shows the calculation of the nonequilibrium pop-
ulation dynamics given diﬀerent system initial conditions,
ρS (0) ∈ {σx, σy, |1i h1|}. For the initial conditions correspond-
ing to the Pauli matrices, we implement three diﬀerent de-
compositions given by Eqs. (C2), (C3), and (C4), labeled A,
B, and C, respectively. We also include the results for two dif-
ferent decompositions for the initial condition |1i h1|, labeled
A and B. As is clear from panels (a) and (b), all density ma-

The above considerations regarding the subtlety in the den-
sity matrix picture with regard to the implementation of the
Ehrenfest method underlines an important interpretation is-
sue. While it is often regarded that in the Ehrenfest method
the system (bath) evolves under the mean ﬁeld of the classi-
cal (quantum) variables, it is important to add the caveat that
these mean ﬁelds correspond to single rather than ensembles
of trajectories. As such, under the Ehrenfest approximation
the system evolves under the time-dependent Hamiltonian de-
ﬁned as

HS ,Eh(t) = [ε + λcl(t)]σz + ∆σx

(D13)

where the classical bath provides a ﬂuctuating contribution to

the bias energy λcl(t) = αPk ckQk(t) and the equation of mo-

tion for the density matrix of the system is the Liouville equa-
tion using the modiﬁed Hamiltonian,

d

ρS (t) = −i[HEh

The bath, in turn, evolves under the inﬂuence of the time-
dependent Hamiltonian

To calculate auxiliary memory kernels used in the present
work, trajectories corresponding to a set of initial conditions
given by the Wigner distribution, Eq. (D3), are calculated via
a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme. During individual time
steps, ¯σz(t) is kept constant for the evolution of the bath, while
λcl(t) is kept constant during the evolution of the system. Over

a half time step, the equations for the classical variables take
the forms,

While convergence for correlation functions of system oper-
ators only requires only ∼ 103 − 104 trajectories, correlation
functions with bath operators require ∼ 3 × 104 − 105 trajec-
tories for suﬃciently accurate results.
