Abstract
Magnetic ﬁelds play essential roles in various astronomical objects. Radio astronomy has
revealed that magnetic ﬁelds are ubiquitous in our Universe. However, the real origin and
evolution of magnetic ﬁelds is poorly proven.
In order to advance our knowledge of cosmic
magnetism in coming decades, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) should have supreme sen-
sitivity than ever before, which provides numerous observation points in the cosmic space.
Furthermore, the SKA should be designed to facilitate wideband polarimetry so as to allow
us to examine sightline structures of magnetic ﬁelds by means of depolarization and Faraday
Tomography. The SKA will be able to drive cosmic magnetism of the interstellar medium, the
Milky Way, galaxies, AGN, galaxy clusters, and potentially the cosmic web which may pre-
serve information of the primeval Universe. The Japan SKA Consortium (SKA-JP) Magnetism
Science Working Group (SWG) proposes the project ”Resolving 4-D Nature of Magnetism with
Depolarization and Faraday Tomography”, which contains ten scientiﬁc use cases.

1 Introduction
(Electro)-Magnetism is one of the four fundamental forces in
the Universe. Magnetic ﬁelds induce fundamental astrophys-
ical processes such as particle acceleration, nonthermal radia-
tion, and polarization, and impact on activities of astronomi-
cal objects through ﬁeld tension, reconnection, instability, and

turbulence.
magnetic ﬁelds is often explained by common theories of mag-
netism, though various effects caused by magnetic ﬁelds make
them difﬁcult to understand themselves. Understanding local
magnetic ﬁelds will assist studies of the epoch of reionization,
the cosmic microwave background polarization, and the ultra
high energy cosmic rays (CRs), while deepest magnetic ﬁelds

may preserve information of the early Universe.

Centimeter and meter wavelength radio astronomy is a pi-
oneer and leader of exploring magnetic ﬁelds in the Universe.
It has discovered magnetic ﬁelds in and around most of astro-
nomical objects, and has provided a lot of clues for understand-
ing the nature of magnetic ﬁelds. However, the real origin and
evolution of magnetic ﬁelds is poorly proven, because it is dif-
ﬁcult with a lack of sensitivity and polarization capability to go
back in time by exploring high redshift Universe. Even mag-
netic ﬁelds in the Milky Way is not well-understood, because a
wide-ﬁeld survey is essential but is also expensive. These chal-
lenges suggest an observatory having supreme sensitivity and
high polarization capability on the scale of the SKA.

We, the SKA-JP Magnetism SWG, have developed our sci-
ence objectives since 2010. We conclude that comprehensive
study from the Sun to the early Universe is important to under-
stand magnetism’s diversity and universality. Therefore, instead
of making a short list of science objectives, we focus on SKA’s
capability of wideband polarimetry which enable us to utilize
some new observational techniques introduced in the follow-
ing sections. We propose the project ”Resolving 4-D Nature of
Magnetism with Depolarization and Faraday Tomography”, in
which we demonstrate ten scientiﬁc use cases based on careful
considerations on depolarization and Faraday tomography.

The purpose of this document is to introduce Japanese sci-
entiﬁc interests in the SKA project and to report results of our
investigation. It is still in progress, so that the document may
not fully cover previous works related to the SKA. We wish that
the document becomes an interface for future communications,
collaborations, and synergies with worldwide communities. In
the rest of this section, we introduce the methods to study mag-
netic ﬁelds with the SKA, except the Zeeman effect which is
introduced in a separate paper. We overview the international
magnetism sciences in Section 2 and describe Japanese mag-
netism sciences in Section 3. We summarize in Section 4.

1.1 Synchrotron Radiation and Faraday Rotation

Below, so as to make discussion easy, we ﬁgure out the min-
imum basis and physical parameters of synchrotron radiation
and Faraday rotation, which are well-established tools to study
cosmic magnetism. See the textbooks for details (e.g., Rybicki
& Lightman 1979; Rohlfs & Wilson 1996).

Synchrotron radiation is the bremsstrahlung emitted from a
relativistic particle gyrating around magnetic ﬁelds. Suppose
the isotropic distribution of relativistic electrons, we consider
the following energy distribution of the electrons, N (γ)dγ =
C(r)γ−pdγ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, C(r) is the number
density of the electrons located at the position r, and p is the
spectral index. The synchrotron emissivity can be written as

ǫ(r) ∝ C(r)B⊥(r)(1+p)/2ω(1−p)/2

(1)

where B⊥ is the strength of magnetic ﬁelds perpendicular to
the line-of-sight (LOS) and ω = 2πν is the angular frequency.
The integral of the emissivity gives the Stokes parameters I, Q,
U, V , and we deﬁne the linear polarization, P = Q + iU, the
fractional polarization, Π = (Q2 + U 2 + V 2)1/2/I, the polar-
ization angle, χ = (1/2) arctan(U/Q), and the electric-vector
angle ψ = 2χ, where χ ranges −π/4 ≤ χ ≤ π/4. Therefore,
once we observe synchrotron radiation and assume C(r), we
can estimate the integral of B⊥.

When polarized emission passes through magneto-ionic me-
dia, its polarization angle rotates as χ = χ0 + RM λ2 (Faraday
rotation). Here χ0 is the initial polarization angle and λ is the
wavelength. RM is the rotation measure,

RM (rad m−2) ≈ 811.9Z (cid:16) ne

cm−2(cid:17)(cid:18) B||

µG(cid:19)(cid:18) dr

kpc(cid:19) ,

(2)

where ne is the density of free electrons, B|| is the strength of
magnetic ﬁelds parallel to the LOS, and RM is positive if the
magnetic ﬁeld points toward the observer. Therefore, once we
observe RM and assume ne, we can estimate the integral of B||.
Faraday rotation suggests that RM can be derived from at least
two polarization angles measured at different wavelengths. In
addition, with RM, we can perform inverse Faraday rotation and
can guess the intrinsic polarization angle, which is perpendicu-
lar to the ﬁeld direction if the polarization is synchrotron.

1.2 Depolarization and Faraday Tomography

Depolarization and Faraday tomography are thought to have the
capability to resolve three dimensional structure of magnetic
ﬁelds. But their applications to real observations have been
limited and they have been under development since 60’s (e.g.,
Burn 1966), because they require wideband polarimetric data
which are expensive to obtain. The SKA should facilitate wide-
band polarimetric observation and break through the situation
in order to advance the study of cosmic magnetism.

Depolarization is the phenomenon that we observe weaker
polarization than that at the origin. It depends on properties of
matters along the path of the polarization. Burn (1966) formu-
lated depolarization in several simple situations. For example,
in the case that there is a matter with uniform electron density
and uniform magnetic ﬁelds, the fractional polarization Πl of
the matter for a speciﬁc sightline can be written as

Πl(λ2) = Πl0(λ2)

sin(cid:0)RM λ2(cid:1)

RM λ2

exp2i(cid:16)χ0 +

RM λ2(cid:17),

(3)

where Πl0 is the intrinsic fractional polarization. This case is
called as differential Faraday rotation depolarization.

Another example is beam depolarization. We suppose that
RM distribution inside a beam area follows the Gaussian with
the standard deviation of σRM. In the case that this RM source
itself is an emitter of polarization, Πl can be written as

and is called as external Faraday dispersion depolarization.

Figure 1 shows the Burn laws. As shown, the degree of de-
polarization depends on frequency. Wide frequency coverage
is hence essential to capture the feature of depolarization. The
fact that depolarization is weaker at higher frequencies implies
that the observed fractional polarization can tend to be larger for
higher redshift sources, because depolarization happens at their
rest-frame (higher) frequencies.

Faraday Tomography is a decomposition technique proposed

by Burn (1966). The polarized intensity can be written as

where χ(r, λ2) = χ0(r) + φ(r)λ2 is the polarization angle at
the observer, χ0(r) is the polarization angle at the origin r, and
φ(r) is the Faraday depth in rad m−2. F (φ) ≡ ε(φ)e2iχ0(φ) is
the Faraday dispersion function (FDF) or the Faraday spectrum,
which represents cross sections of the polarized intensity along
the LOS (though φ(r) and r are not in one to one correspon-
dence). We changed the integration variable from r to φ(r),
resulting in the form of Fourier transformation with conjugate
variables φ and λ2. Therefore, the inverse Fourier transforma-

K −1R(φ) ∗ F (φ) and R(φ) = K R ∞

Using the convolution theorem, this equation becomes ˜F (φ) =
dλ2,
where K is the normalization and R(φ) is the rotation measure
spread function (RMSF). If R(φ)/K is the delta function δ(φ),
the reconstruction is perfect. But in reality it is impossible to
ﬁll out all λ2 space with observed data. Figure 2 shows some
examples of RMSF.

The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the RMSF
corresponds to the resolution in the Faraday depth space. For
example, we consider the case that the window function is
W (λ2) = 1 at observed wavelengths (λ2
max) and
otherwise W (λ2) = 0. The FWHM of the RMSF is

min ≤ λ2 ≤ λ2

FWHM (rad m−2) =

max − λ2

This indicates that the resolution is determined by the λ2-
space coverage, ∆λ2 = λ2
min. Particularly, going down
to a longer wavelength expands the λ2 coverage effectively,
though it tends to suffer from depolarization more seriously.
Depolarization can be signiﬁcant at the wavelength where the
polarization angle rotates by π. Hence the maximum observ-
able Faraday depth width of a feature which is extended in the
Faraday depth space is

Lφ,max (rad m−2) ≈

In order to make Faraday tomography feasible, the above two
frequency conditions are at least needed to be improved.

2 SKA Magnetism Science

In this section, we brieﬂy introduce major magnetism science
partly developed by the international SKA Cosmic Magnetism
SWG, and partly presented in the international SKA Science
Book (2015). The SWG are also developing notional survey
projects, which are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. A polariza-
tion sky survey with SKA1-MID Band-2 is the highest priority
science objective, which maximizes scientiﬁc outcomes includ-
ing local clouds to high redshift objects.

Figure 3 shows the largest (37,543) RM catalog of extra-
galactic polarized sources (Taylor, Stil, & Sunstrum 2009). All-
sky polarization surveys can provide such “RM grid” maps,
which are useful for studying spatial structures of magnetic
ﬁelds. Increasing the number of sources, i.e. denser RM grids,
can reveal smaller spatial structures, and can also provide more
observation points in redshift space, allowing us to study the
cosmic evolution of magnetic ﬁelds.

Table 3 lists the expected density of RM grids to be obtained
with the SKA1. These estimations are basically derived from
Figure 4, which summarizes plots of observed source popula-
tions (mostly FR galaxies and quasars) at 1.4 GHz. Because the
measured populations have a large scatter, there is still a factor
of four uncertainty in the estimation of RM grids (Govoni et al.
2014); the population below 10 µJy is not well-known. Faint
components such as star-forming galaxies, ULIRGs, merging

galaxies, and quiet spiral galaxies, would be more important in
the low luminosity regime (Taylor et al. 2015). Deep pilot ob-
servations (Fig. 4) are useful to foresee the density of RM grids
in the SKA era. Studying the population itself is an interesting
theme to understand the population of galaxies and AGN.

tant to understand the dynamical role of the magnetic ﬁelds
in HII regions over a large density range. We need to measure
magnetic ﬁelds in HII regions using dense RM grids.

• Planetary nebulae: Old planetary nebulae are good probes
of the ISM magnetic ﬁelds. The ISM magnetic ﬁeld around
the nebula shell is compressed and deﬂected. Since back-
ground radio emission is Faraday rotated with this ﬁeld, we
can observe systematic variation of the polarization angle
across the shell. It would be possible to study the ISM mag-
netic ﬁelds around the planetary nebulae through measure-
ments of polarization with high angular resolution.

• Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe): The pulsar generates a rel-
ativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind. Such pulsar
wind terminates at a strong shock. Relativistic particles in the
downstream of the shock emit non-thermal radiations, which
are identiﬁed as PWNe. It would be possible to understand
the role of magnetic ﬁelds through observations of polarized
emission from PWNe and RMs of background sources.

• Faraday screens: Faraday screens are unidentiﬁed radio
sources. They are visible in polarized intensity and RM, but
are faint in total intensity. Some of them may be associated
with PWNe and old HII regions.

• Molecular clouds: The role of magnetic ﬁelds in star for-
mation has been debated for decades. Strong- and weak-ﬁeld
models, in which the efﬁciency of ambipolar diffusion is dif-
ferent, predict different star-formation scenarios. While it is
difﬁcult to measure the detailed ﬁeld strength and geometry
of dense molecular clouds, the SKA could detect in-situ syn-
chrotron radiation of ∼ mJy at 1 GHz emitted by Galactic
CRs penetrating collapsing dense molecular clouds.

2.2 The Milky Way

The Milky Way has large-scale magnetic ﬁelds along the spi-
ral arms. The typical strength of the magnetic ﬁelds is about 3
µG (e.g., Han et al. 2006). Recent observational studies con-
cluded that it has an axisymmetric spiral structure with at least
one reversal in the Milky Way. The dynamo theory indeed fa-
vored an axisymmetric structure of even parity with respect to
the galactic mid-plane, i.e., the horizontal ﬁeld component has
the same direction on either side of the mid-plane, while the ver-
tical component changes sign across the mid-plane (Ruzmaikin,
Sokoloff, & Shukurov 1988). The toroidal ﬁeld component is
dominated in the axisymmetric structure together with a small
radial component.

As for the Milky Way halo, some observations suggested
that the magnetic-ﬁeld structure is an dipolar-type (odd parity)
(Han et al. 1997), spiral, or X-shaped, though it is still difﬁcult

Owen 2014; Taylor et al. 2015). The red and blue, purple, and green lines
are based on the deep observations of the ∼ 0.2 deg2 VLA GOODS-N ﬁeld
(Rudnick & Owen 2014), the ∼ 6 deg2 ATCA ATLAS ﬁeld (Hales et al. 2014),
and the all-sky VLA NVSS survey (Stil et al. 2014), respectively.

2.1 Interstellar Medium

SKA’s dense RM grids will allow us to study magnetic-ﬁeld
structures of various discrete sources in detail. Furthermore,
we will be able to study the structures along the LOS through
Faraday tomography with broadband polarimetry. Below, we
brieﬂy summarize the current status of research in magnetic
ﬁelds of various discrete sources in the Milky Way. See e.g.,
Haverkorn et al. (2015) and references therein.
• Young stellar objects (YSOs): Jets and outﬂows of YSOs
have been studied through observations of molecular emis-
sion lines. MHD processes are widely accepted as the launch-
ing mechanisms for the jets and the outﬂows. Measurement
of linearly polarized synchrotron emission makes it possible
to study the magnetic-ﬁeld structure of YSOs.

• Supernova remnants (SNRs): A SNR expands into the in-
terstellar medium (ISM) with kinetic energy of ∼ 1051 ergs.
The kinetic energy can be converted to the energies of mag-
netic ﬁelds, high-energy particles, and turbulence. Actually,
observations suggest that magnetic ﬁelds in SNRs should be
ampliﬁed to mG through interaction between shock waves
and the ISM. Shock waves and magnetic ﬁelds are important
for acceleration of the Galactic CRs. SNRs are thought to
be the main energy source which drives the interstellar turbu-
lence.

• HII regions: The strength of magnetic ﬁelds in HII regions
has been estimated to be a few to a few tens of µG from ob-
servations of Faraday rotation of background radio sources
and background Galactic synchrotron emission (Sun et al.
2007; Gao et al. 2010; Harvey-Smith et al. 2011). It is impor-

6

Japan SKA Consortium (2016)

to characterize the global halo structure. The dynamo theory
favored axisymmetric mode with odd parity in the spherical ob-
jects such as a galactic halo. The X-shaped structure may be
produced by a large-scale Galactic wind.

The turbulent magnetic ﬁeld would exist because the turbu-
lent gas exists in the ISM, although the power spectrum of the
magnetic ﬁeld is difﬁcult to observe. The energy injection scale
of the interstellar turbulence is suggested to be the order of 1 pc
at spiral arms and the order of 100 pc at interarm regions.

The magnetic ﬁeld strength at the Galactic center shows sev-
eral values from 10 µG to 1 mG, depending on the scales. It is
reported that the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld is dominated around
50 pc to 300 pc near the dynamical center of the Milky Way.

Resolving magnetic ﬁelds in the Milky Way is essential to
elucidate their origin and maintenance mechanism by compar-
ing to theoretical models. Understanding structure of the mag-
netic ﬁelds is also crucial for the studies of CMB polarization,
redshifted HI emission at the epoch of reionization (EoR), and
deﬂection of ultra-high energy CRs, and so on.

2.3 Nearby Galaxies

Similar to the Milky Way, galactic magnetic ﬁelds can be de-
scribed as the combination of large-scale, regular ﬁelds and
small-scale, turbulent ﬁelds. Observed depolarization implies
that the coherence length of the turbulent magnetic ﬁelds is
∼ 50 pc (Beck 2007). The regular magnetic ﬁelds are along
with spiral structure and ordered in the regions where strong
shear occurs, the ISM is compressed, or turbulence is small. X-
shaped halo magnetic ﬁelds are seen in some galaxies (Krause
et al. 2014; Soida et al. 2011). They may link with the weak
poloidal magnetic ﬁelds predicted by the α-Ω dynamo theory,
as well as galactic winds related to star formation.

Galactic magnetic ﬁelds are thought to be determined with
parameters characterizing galactic large-scale structures, such
as (i) the rotation curve related with shear motion of the ISM,
(ii) the star formation rate related with the α effect, (iii) the den-
sity and turbulent velocity of the ISM indicating the upper limit
of magnetic energy, and (iv) the disk size indicating magnetic
order. However, there is no observational evidence supporting
the correlation between large-scale magnetic ﬁelds and the star-
formation rate. There is also no observational evidence sup-
porting the prediction that turbulence dynamo worked signiﬁ-
cantly in the stage of galaxy formation. A clue is that reversal
in magnetic ﬁelds due likely to turbulence dynamo is found in
the Milky Way (van Eck et al. 2011).

Magnetic ﬁelds in elliptical and dwarf galaxies are highly
unknown. It is true that there is differential rotation in both late-
and early-type galaxies. The differential rotation can cause tur-

bulence dynamo and the magneto-rotational and the Parker in-
stabilities, which can produce both small- and large-scale mag-
netic ﬁelds. Therefore, both magnetic ﬁelds should exist in el-
liptical galaxies. However, observational study is difﬁcult for
elliptical galaxies because synchrotron emission is weak. A
more fundamental problem would be that large-scale magnetic
ﬁelds are observed in dwarf galaxies LMC, SMC, and IC10. It
may be difﬁcult to explain them by galactic dynamo since the
dynamo does not work so much in such dwarf systems.

In order to resolve the problems described above and to un-
derstand the origin of galactic magnetic ﬁelds, it is essential
to investigate many nearby galaxies and to examine diversity
of magnetic ﬁelds and relations between magnetic ﬁelds and
star-formation or galaxy morphology. The cosmological evo-
lution of magnetic ﬁelds can be partly studied within a given
redshift range. The international SWG proposed the following
high resolution observation; (i) frequency range: 2.8–5.18 GHz
with SKA1-MID Band-4, (ii) resolution: 5′′, (iii) sensitivity:
0.2 µJy/beam (12 hrs) in rms. Targets are galaxies within
20 Mpc and Dec < 15◦ listed in Table 4.

2.4 Distant Galaxies

As already described in the previous sections, dynamo is one
of the key mechanisms for the generation and maintenance of
galactic magnetic ﬁelds. Numerical simulations suggest that,
while small-scale magnetic ﬁelds is established in hundreds mil-
lion years through turbulence dynamo (Schober et al. 2012),
large-scale magnetic ﬁelds grows up by the α-Ω dynamo in
the timescale comparable to the disk rotation (Brandenburg &
Subramanian 2005); for instance, kpc-scale magnetic ﬁelds at
z = 3 could evolve to galactic-scale ﬁelds by z = 0.5 (Arshakian
et al. 2009). The evolution could be affected by the star-
formation, feedback, and galaxy merger, although these factors
are still hard to fully incorporate into cosmological MHD sim-
ulations of galaxy formation.

Observing distant galaxies allows us to go back in time and
to examine the evolution of galactic magnetic ﬁelds. However,
it is difﬁcult to observe faint galactic synchrotron emission from
distant galaxies. In order to overcome the difﬁculty, three ap-
proaches are proposed in the SKA science book 2015.

Japan SKA Consortium (2016)

7

The ﬁrst approach is to carry out deep observations. We re-
quest (i) wideband to resolve a degeneracy between Faraday ro-
tation and depolarization caused by multiple components along
the LOS, (ii) high sensitivity and wide FoV to overlap with op-
tical surveys, and (iii) high angular resolution to cut out an area
of polarization corresponding to the position of the optical spec-
trum. With 100 hours per pointing for SKA1-MID Band-2, we
will achieve the sensitivity 75 nJy in rms, which is one order
of magnitude better than ever before. With the sensitivity, we
can study the cosmological evolution of disk galaxies beyond
the redshift z > 2.5 and AGN and star-forming galaxies beyond
z > 7 (Taylor et al. 2015). The survey can combine with a com-
mensal HI absorption survey and future optical and infrared sur-
veys (4MOST, WFIRST, LSST, Euclid), allowing us to under-
stand galactic gas, turbulence, magnetic ﬁelds, and their spatial
distributions for a wide range of redshift.

The second approach is to perform stacking analysis, in
which polarization signals of faint sources are cumulated based
on their coordinates given by other surveys (Stokes I, optical,
etc). The cumulation permits us to extract statistical informa-
tion of sources whose ﬂux are below the detection limit. For
example, Stil et al. (2014) revealed that fainter sources below
the detection limit of the NVSS S1.4 ∼ 80 mJy tend to have
higher fractional polarization. It may be because depolarization
is minor at rest-frame frequencies of distant galaxies (Mesa et
al. 2002). With stacking analysis, we could compare magnetic
ﬁelds in dwarf galaxies, star-forming galaxies, and the Milky
way, and could examine the relation between magnetic ﬁelds
and the star-formation rate, down to very faint systems. A com-
mensal HI survey is quite helpful, because the HI line proﬁle
informs redshift, gas state, dynamics of galaxies, and the mass
ratio between HI and stars.

The third approach is to observe galaxies intervening the
LOS toward polarized sources. This approach does not suf-
fer from the bias that we look brighter galaxies. Combining
with MgII optical line/imaging surveys, we could search the
strength, growth time, and coherence length of galactic dynamo
in disks and halos of normal galaxies, as well as beam cover-
ing fractions and spatial sizes of intervening galaxies, all as a
function of redshift (Kronberg et al. 2008; Bernet, Miniati, &
Lilly 2012; Bernet, Miniati, & Lilly 2013). Figure 5 shows the
relation between the total intensity spectrum index α and the
polarization spectrum index β (Farnes et al. 2014a). There are
two populations, an optically-thick AGN-core type (α ∼ 0) and
an optically-thin radio-lobe type (α ∼ −0.7). The behavior of β
depends on α, therefore, part of depolarization may take place at
the source because α should depend only on the source nature.
On the other hand, Farnes et al. (2014b) suggested that there is
a clear correlation between RM and the existence of foreground
MgII absorption systems for the AGN-core type (Fig. 5). A
large number of sources to be found with the SKA will allow us

2.5 AGN and Jets

There are various unsolved problems on AGN jets, such as the
acceleration mechanism, the acceleration spot, the composition
of jets, and the inﬂuences from/to environment. A survey with
the SKA1 will provide a catalog of nearby jets, and the catalog
will allow us to tackle some key issues of AGN jets.

For instance, several thousands of radio ”quiet” AGNs will
be discovered from the survey. We will investigate an essen-
tial difference in jet power between radio loud and quiet AGNs,
using SKA-VLBI Band-3 and Band-5 observations. Such high
resolution observations allow us to distinguish between a jet and
star formation in radio quiet AGN systems. The star formation
rate can be discussed, too. Various pc-scale jets will be observed
and spatially resolved with SKA-VLBI Band-5.

A survey with the sensitivity of 100 nJy in rms allows us to
ﬁnd the central massive black holes of normal galaxies located
at up to z ∼ 8, if the the AGN luminosity is about the Eddington
luminosity. Such deep observations with the SKA1 could pro-

vide the information about co-evolution among the central black
hole, galactic magnetic ﬁelds, and the host galaxy. Observing
AGNs in wide ranges of fractional polarization and redshift en-
ables us to make a catalog of magnetic-ﬁeld structures as a func-
tion of time.

Wideband polarimetry is quite powerful for studying AGN
jet structures. Figure 6 introduces a result for distant quasar
PKS B1610-771 (O’Sullivan et al. 2012; Gaensler et al. 2015).
If we employ narrow bandwidth data (350 MHz bandwidth cen-
tered at 1.4 GHz), we obtain a single RM component with +135
rad m−2. But with full bandwidth data (1.1 – 3.1 GHz), they
ﬁnd that we obtain two polarized “knots” with RMs of +107
rad m−2 and +79 rad m−2. This demonstrates that SKA’s wide-
band studies could highlight structures of AGN, radio lobes, and
surrounding gas even if they are spatially unresolved.

Observation of circular polarization will be able to give a
direct measurement of magnetic ﬁeld strength, a real magnetic
ﬂux propagating by a jet, and information about a composition
of the jet (i.e. the positron–proton ratio). Thanks to high sen-
sitivity and wide frequency coverage, SKA1 is an ideal device
to observe the circular polarization, because Stokes V of AGN
is typically weak (∼ 0.1 – 1 % of Stokes I) and it is hard to
observe with the current facilities. If circular polarization is de-
tected, SKA-VLBI should try to identify the emission region.
We aim to determine physical parameters of the jet (strength,
composition, magnetic ﬂux) from the comparison with the ob-
served data and theoretical models.

2.6 Galaxy Clusters

It is expected that there are magnetic turbulence in the intra-
cluster medium (ICM). At the same time, magnetic ﬁelds or-
dered along a speciﬁc direction may also exist due to compres-
sion of the gas by AGN outﬂows and cluster-merger shocks.
Even Mpc-scale coherent magnetic ﬁelds might exist according
to cosmological origins (§3.11). Clear evidence of magnetic
ﬁelds is diffuse synchrotron emission called radio mini halo,
radio halo, and radio relic, as well as Faraday rotation of back-
ground polarized sources; there are a lot of radio observations
(e.g., Ferretti et al. 2012, Fig. 7). A brief summary of cluster
magnetic ﬁelds is as follows.
• Structure: Micro-Gauss magnetic ﬁelds in the ICM have
been reported. These spatial power spectra can be inferred
from RM of back ground polarized sources, and so on. RM
maps imply the Kolmogorov-like power spectrum (Guidetti
et al. 2008). A weak polarized intensity of radio halos im-
plies signiﬁcant power at small spatial scales.

• Origin and evolution: There are several hypotheses of the
origin and ampliﬁcation of cluster magnetic ﬁelds (V¨olk &
Atoyan 2000; Ryu et al. 2008), but those are not yet proven
by any observation. There are only a few attempts of cosmo-
logical MHD simulations of cluster formation.

• Modelling: Simulators of RM maps using (semi)-analytic
models of the gas density and magnetic ﬁelds have been de-
veloped (e.g. FARADAY, Murgia et al. 2004). Comparison
between the simulated and observed data allows us to quan-
tify cluster magnetic ﬁelds. A detailed radial proﬁle of RM
could relax the degeneracy of parameters in the magnetic-
ﬁeld models. Such semi-analytic simulations are also useful

Japan SKA Consortium (2016)

for planning SKA observations.

With SKA1’s improved sensitivity, we will be able to obtain
dense RM grids and study structures of cluster magnetic ﬁelds
in detail. About three hundred polarized sources per square de-
gree would be detected with the SKA1 at the sensitivity of 1 µJy
in rms at 1.4 GHz and the angular resolution of 1′′.6. If we ob-
serve a Coma-like cluster, ∼ 50 polarized sources, which is 7
times larger than the VLA observations, would be detected.

In the early operation (∼ 50 % sensitivity) of the SKA1,
the number of detected polarized sources are sufﬁcient to study
massive clusters above 1015 solar mass. They are, on the other
hand, insufﬁcient to study normal clusters and shock waves.
Full SKA1 and SKA phase 2 (SKA2) are needed to address
magnetic ﬁelds in normal clusters and shock waves.

Information of the total and polarized intensity spectra
would also be obtained from the improvement of the bandwidth.
These information can be used to determine the energy spec-
trum of CRs. The SKA2 will get a 10 times better sensitivity
and 20 times wider FoV. Improvement of the spatial resolution
can reveal magnetic ﬁelds in smaller scales.

2.7 The Cosmic Web

Galaxy ﬁlaments may be an unique site in which the informa-
tion of primordial magnetic ﬁelds remains. If we ﬁnd the in-
tergalactic magnetic ﬁeld (IGMF) in galaxy ﬁlaments, we may
be able to test theoretical models of the generation and evolu-
tion of cosmological magnetic ﬁelds. The test would lead fur-
ther discoveries related to the epoch of reionization, the ﬁrst star
formation, the cosmological recombination, even the physics of
the early Universe. However, there have been few observations
of the IGMF in galaxy ﬁlaments (e.g., Bagchi et al. 2002).

The main reason of the lack of observations is that the IGMF
is expected to be very weak. Cosmological simulations suggest
that the IGMF in ﬁlaments may have B ∼1 – 100 nG (e.g., Ryu
et al. 2008). Such a weak ﬁeld gives a small RM. The rms value
of RM through a single ﬁlament would be ∼ 1 rad m−2 (Fig. 8
left), while that through several ﬁlaments up to z ∼ a few would
reach several rad m−2 (Fig. 8 middle). The simulation predicts
that the IGMF in ﬁlaments would induce RM with a ﬂat second-
order structure function (SF) with ∼ 100 rad2 m−4 at angular
scales of r > 0.1◦ (Fig. 8 right), while the Galactic magnetic
ﬁelds should produce substantially smaller and steeper SF in
small angular scales toward high galactic latitudes. A deep sur-
vey below the sensitivity 100 nJy in rms with SKA1-MID Band-
2 will make it possible to ﬁgure out the SF at the scale r > 0.1◦,
and allow us to extract the RM of the IGMF in ﬁlaments. It is
also expected very recently that fast radio burst (FRB) would be

a new probe of the IGMF in ﬁlaments (Akahori et al. 2016a).

The information ﬁeld theory would assist the detection of
the IGMF in galaxy ﬁlaments (Enßlin et al. 2009). The method
statistically separates different extragalactic contributions, by
combining RMs with the information about the large-scale
structure of the cosmic web. Since the RM grid obtained with
the SKA1 will be 300 – 1000 times denser than the largest cat-
alog available in the present, it will be possible to identify op-
tical counterparts uniquely and hence the source redshift. An
uncertainty in RM will be lower than ∼ 0.2 rad m−2 by the ob-
servation of one hour and the resolution of 2′′ observation with
SKA1-MID (350 – 3050 MHz) which provides the polarization
sensitivity below 1 µJy. These allow us to distinguish nearby
components in Faraday spectra and improve statistics. Using
the method, we could detect ∼ nG magnetic ﬁelds during the
early operation (∼ 50 % sensitivity) of the SKA1.

The predicted weak IGMF also make it difﬁcult to observe
synchrotron radiation from galaxy ﬁlaments. A sensitivity of
∼ 10 nJy/arcsec2 at 1.4 GHz will be needed to detect the ra-
diation, based on a few evidence of Mpc-scale diffuse emis-
sions corresponding likely to galaxy ﬁlaments (e.g., Bagchi et
al. 2002). This study is best achieved with SKA1-MID Band-2.
A two hours observation with a 800 MHz bandwidth and a 3′′
resolution will provide the 0.08 µJy/beam sensitivity, which al-
lows us to detect synchrotron radiation from galaxy ﬁlaments at
a 2.5 – 6 σ level.

For our feasibility veriﬁcation below, we have referred the

Although the re-baseline decision does not include MID Bands

3, 4, and 5+, we have considered them as possible extensions of
the SKA1. We have employed the 100 kHz point-source sensi-
tivities of 184, 132, 66, 83, 100, and 132 µJy hr−1/2 for SKA1
LOW, MID Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. We have ig-
nored penalties of radio frequency interferences (RFIs).

Our scientiﬁc objectives and use cases introduced below
are not ofﬁcial ones organized by the SKAO. We acknowledge
SKA’s policy on open co-development of sciences and notional
key science projects, and hence our proposals do not insist on
any Japan’s priority. We also acknowledge international SKA
SWGs, since some of our proposals are inspired gratefully by
the ones developed by them.

3.1 Pulsar RMs and the Galactic Magnetic Field

Structure

This science objective and its use case, SKAJP-MAG-1 (ISM),
are described in the SKA-JP Pulsar Science Chapter.

3.2 Unveiling Zebra Pattern in High Galactic RM Sky

3.2.1 Objective
The origin and evolution of the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld in
the Milky Way is one of the most important subjects in SKA’s
cosmic magnetism. Using numerical simulation, we will re-
veal the importance of CRs that exist in the interstellar medium.
The CRs strongly affect the magnetic buoyant instability, such
as Parker instability, which is believed to be coupled with the
galactic dynamo.

The numerical simulation of the Parker instability with CRs
is ﬁrst studied by Kuwabara et al. (2004), and followed by
Kudoh et al. (2014) under the situation of local galactic disks.
We will study the galactic dynamo using numerical simula-
tions of global galactic disks like Nishikori et al. (2006) and
include CRs in the simulations. The numerical simulations of
galactic dynamo with CRs was studied by Hanasz et al. (2009).
However, the physical process of the galactic dynamo and the
importance of CRs have not been clear yet. Our numerical sim-
ulations should be cooperated with observations as well as ana-
lytical theories.

We propose the observations of RMs at high galactic lati-
tudes. Akahori et al. (2013) showed that the observed north
and south anti-symmetric structure of magnetic ﬁelds cannot be
explained by randomness of turbulent magnetic ﬁelds. They
claimed that the origin of the anti-symmetric structure would
be caused by the Parker instability. Machida et al. (2013) per-
formed the numerical simulations of galactic dynamo in the
global disk, and showed that the north and south magnetic struc-
tures are periodically exchanged because of the magnetic buoy-
ancy. The model predicts a zebra pattern of RM at high galactic
latitudes (Fig. 9). The observational results should be compared
with that of the numerical simulation. We also study the effect

simulation of galactic gaseous disks (Machida et al. 2013).

ical simulations of Machida et al. (2013) by including CRs into
the code.

3.2.2 Use Case: SKAJP-MAG-2 (MWG)
As described above, there can be halo toroidal ﬁelds induced
by the magneto-rotational instability and the Parker instability.
Such toroidal ﬁelds are expected to remain, showing a zebra
pattern (with a scale of ∼ 5◦) of Stokes I and RM at high galac-
tic latitudes (Machida et al. 2013; Morita et al. 2016). We try
to discover the pattern in a Stokes I map for low frequencies.
Furthermore, with a full band polarimetric data, we attempt to
study sub-patterns (∼ degree scales) in the RM map by means
of Faraday synthesis, resolving LOS structures on some levels.
We ﬁnally perform Fourier analyses of Stokes I and RM maps
and compare the power spectra with those of our theoretical pre-
diction. This study will constrain real mechanisms of the origin
and evolution of Milky Way magnetic ﬁelds.

The standard observing procedure can be adopted. More
speciﬁcally, the project can be divided into many scheduling
blocks with an appropriate mosaicking strategy. Each block
may start/end observations of band-pass calibrators and consists
of observations of targets and gain/phase calibrators. Nighttime
observation is preferable to avoid possible RFIs seen in the day-
time. If daytime, we will avoid observations within 10 degree

from the Sun. We should note that the calibration stability in
time should be taken into consideration very much in low fre-
quency observations.

A minimum antenna baseline of ∼ 40 m at zenith will pro-
vide the maximum angular scale of ∼ 5◦ at 150 MHz, and this
speciﬁcation could satisfactorily capture the zebra pattern we
are looking for. A planning concept of sub-station operation is
quite promising for this use case and will allow us to clarify the
error of the missing ﬂux.

We will utilize data of the all-sky Band-2 survey. The cen-
timeter data would be useful to subtract point sources. We
also attempt to extract the Milky Way foreground component,
by incorporating the centimeter data into Faraday tomography.
For LOW data only, speciﬁcations of Faraday Synthesis are
the Faraday depth resolution is 0.098 rad m−2
as follows:
(50 – 350 MHz), the maximum observable Faraday depth is
833.7 rad m−2 (349 – 350 MHz), and the maximum observable
Faraday thickness is 4.28 rad m−2 (350 MHz).

3.3 Classiﬁcation of Polarized Pattern in Nearby

Edge-on Galaxies

3.3.1 Objective
Galactic magnetic ﬁelds are thought to play important roles in
star formation, interstellar turbulence, activity of galactic cen-
ter, and galactic wind which transports magnetized plasma from
disk to halo. Some scenarios of the origin of ordered magnetic
ﬁelds have been proposed; for example, a primordial-origin
model for composite conﬁgurations of global magnetic ﬁelds
(Sofue et al. 2010) and a galactic dynamo model (Sofue et al.
1986). Disk ordered magnetic ﬁelds are mainly classiﬁed into
Axis Symmetric Spiral (ASS) and Bi Symmetric Spiral (BSS)
(see .e.g., Sofue et al. 1986). In addition, Fletcher et al. (2011)
reported composite structures: ASS in disk and BSS in halo for
M51. Otherwise, edge-on view of ordered ﬁelds show X-shape
structure (e.g. Mora & Krause 2013).

Although there are many attempts of morphological classiﬁ-
cation of galactic magnetic ﬁelds, it is still difﬁcult to compare
theoretical models with observations due to a lack of galaxy
samples. For example, one of the current largest galaxy surveys
WSRT-SINGS (Braun et al. 2007; Heald et al. 2009; Braun et al.
2010) presented galaxies including only 35 edge-on nearby spi-
ral galaxies, which is not enough to perform statistical analysis
by classifying samples into some categories based on the mor-
phology. We also need to improve the method of morphological
classiﬁcation. Up to now, several tens of face-on galaxies have
ever been classiﬁed into ASS or BSS, though the classiﬁcation
is still under discussion (Anraku et al. 2016).

Given this situation, we conclude that a systematic and ex-
tensive survey of nearby galaxies is of crucially importance.
Therefore, we propose a multi frequency polarimetric survey

for polarized synchrotron radiation and RM of nearby galaxies.
We will carry out morphological classiﬁcation of ordered mag-
netic ﬁelds parallel to and perpendicular to the disk. To search
for diversity and universality of magnetic-ﬁeld morphology, we
need a few hundred samples of external galaxies. We must ac-
complish this goal by SKA’s high-sensitivity mission.

In advance of our survey, we have already started to analyze
archival data of polarimetric observations and are developing
a new method of morphological classiﬁcation of ordered mag-
netic ﬁelds in external galaxies (Anraku et al. 2016). Moreover,
we are examining the best observing strategy based on Faraday
depolarization and Faraday tomography. For instance, using
data of MHD simulations, Ideguchi et al. (2014b) showed that
we have to carefully consider the beam size in order to avoid
complexities in features of depolarization and Faraday tomog-
raphy. Although depolarization and Faraday tomography have
the potential to deproject the LOS toroidal and poloidal compo-
nents in the disk and halo, they do not work effectively without
the consideration.

Finally, our morphological classiﬁcation can naturally ex-
tend to distant galaxies, once the supreme sensitivity and ultra-
high resolution of the SKA2 are given. Such extension may
allow us to discover the cosmological co-evolution between
galactic magnetic ﬁelds and galaxies. We can collaborate with
Japanese ”galactic evolution” and ”interstellar medium” SWGs
in this project.

3.3.2 Use Case: SKAJP-MAG-3 (NGL)
We propose observations of the nearby “edge-on” galaxies with
a high sensitivity and a high spatial resolution. In order to clas-
sify polarized pattern into some categories, we will need 200
targets. We will select targets from the Tully’s bright galaxy cat-
alog (which includes more than 200 galaxies and 12 radio coun-
terparts have been detected), where we will discard the galaxies
whose inclination angle < 60◦ or declination > 0◦. SKA1-MID
Band-4 is the best choice because (i) we can gain good spatial
resolution (iii) we can avoid too-strong depolarization and (ii)
synchrotron emission can be not too weak. Using NGC253 as a
typical ﬂux density of targets for our sensitivity calculation, we
request 500 hours observations on source, where we require the
2.′′5 angular resolution corresponding to a spatial resolution of
100 pc at z ∼ 0.001.

The standard observing procedure (scheduling of calibrator
and target observations) and standard data reduction (calibra-
tion, RFI ﬂagging, and imaging) can be adopted. Each target
can be observed with a single pointing, since a typical size of
nearby galaxy, 1′ – 10′, can be covered with a FoV of 16′.5
(SKA1-MID Band-4). This is follow-up observations of the all-
sky Band-2 survey. We suppose that we have nearby edge-on
galaxy candidates in the survey catalog. A table of band-pass
and gain/phase calibrators must be available for Band-4.

3.4 Cosmic Evolution of DIG’s Magnetic Fields

3.4.1 Objective
Observations of galaxies over redshifts are a straightforward
way to elucidate the real evolution history of galactic mag-
netic ﬁelds. As introduced in §2.4, depolarization properties of
background emission allow us to study depolarizing interven-
ing galaxies (DIGs). This approach ﬁts well with the Japanese
focus on depolarization and Faraday tomography.

Optical (MgII absorption) observations indicate the exis-
tence of absorbers in front of about a half of SDSS galax-
ies including polarized sources such as radio galaxies and
quasars (Zhu & Merard 2013). The absorbers are likely DIGs,
which can alter appearance of background polarization (Bernet,
Miniati, & Lilly 2012; Farnes et al. 2014b). With SKA’s wide-
band capability, we could extend the previous works (Farnes
et al. 2014a; Farnes et al. 2014b) dramatically. Increase of the
number of samples allows us to study universality and diversity
of DIG’s properties, and allow us to ﬁgure out the cosmologi-
cal evolution of galactic magnetic ﬁelds. The SKA is an unique
facility which makes these observations possible.

Akahori et al. (2016b) tested depolarization caused by DIGs,
using a model of the Milky Way. Their preliminary results are
as follows. Both the global and local magnetic ﬁelds can con-
tribute to depolarization, and its signiﬁcance depends highly on
observational speciﬁcations such as the observing frequency,
the observing beam size, and the pointing center. The Burn
law is not satisﬁed, because RM distribution within the beam
does not follow the Gaussian. DIG’s contribution to the ob-
served RM decreases signiﬁcantly as the DIG’s redshift in-
creases. Combining SKA observations with these theoretical
works are quite powerful to extract more information about
magnetic ﬁelds and turbulence.

As future works for the DIG simulations, it would be im-
portant to consider the population of galaxies such as the mass
function and morphology. Also, application of Faraday tomog-
raphy and to learn about Faraday spectrum would be important.
Contribution of DIGs to observables becomes an uncertainty
on the studies of other “bright” components such as the source
itself and the Milky Way. However, once we understand the
properties caused by the DIG, such as depolarization features

and Faraday spectra, we could judge the existence of DIGs and
could extract polarized sources toward which there is no DIGs.
Such a source selection is vital for the search of the IGMF.
Therefore, it is fruitful to investigate the properties of DIGs.

3.4.2 Use Case: SKAJP-MAG-4 (DGL)
Since depolarization depends signiﬁcantly on both regular and
turbulent magnetic ﬁelds as well as observational speciﬁca-
tions (as described, Akahori et al. 2016b), a detailed analysis
with large samples is necessary to extract the cosmic evolution
of magnetic ﬁelds in DIGs from observations of background
sources. Wideband polarimetry is essential for this science,
and the all-sky Band-2 survey is insufﬁcient in terms of its fre-
quency coverage. The Band-1 follow-up is necessary to cap-
ture rich depolarization properties caused by DIGs and to make
Faraday tomography much promising. Therefore, we propose
a follow-up project of the all-sky Band-2 survey. We suppose
that we have a polarization catalog of the Band-2 survey and
an all-sky catalog of MgII absorber systems. Then, from these
catalogs, we will select 500 DIGs distributing evenly in redshift
z ∼ 0 – 1 with a bin of δz = 0.1 (50 DIGs in each redshift bin).
Table 7 summarizes key requirements of this use case. In
order to perform systematic analysis combining with the Band-2
data, the spatial resolution (the imaged pixel size) should be the
same as that of Band-2, i.e. 2′′. We require the image rms level
of 4 µJy/beam with 300 MHz bandwidth. This sensitivity would
provide a comparable detection limit to the Band-2 survey, for
AGN-core type sources (α ∼ 0), and a better limit for radio-
lobe type sources (α ∼ −0.7) (see §2.4). We ﬁnally request 182
hours on-source observing time.

The standard observing procedure can be adopted. We
may need a careful scheduling to avoid penalties of Band-1
RFIs which may depend on time (day/night) and season (sum-
mer/winter). The project could be commensal with HI, cos-
mology, and continuum survey. In this case, we need to con-
sult with these survey teams about observing strategy, too. The
standard calibration, optimized ﬂagging, and imaging are per-
formed. The calibrated visibilities are imaged using a 300 MHz
simultaneous bandwidth with robust weighting. Source ﬁnd-
ing is performed on Stokes-I basis with the images. Once de-
tected, the bandwidth is recursively divided by half down to the
1 MHz channel or down to the detection limit so as to gain spec-

troscopic data. Here, a 1 MHz channel provides a maximum
Faraday depth of about 5000 rad m−2 at 700 MHz. For I, Q,
and U of each source, Faraday synthesis is carried out followed
by Faraday RM clean with standard parameters. In addition, for
each source, Q, and U are ﬁtted with several FDF models by
means of an MCMC method, where the result of RM clean is
used as an initial guess.

3.5 Typical magnetic-ﬁeld structure of FR galaxies

3.5.1 Objective
We, Japanese researchers, have performed various numerical
simulations related to jets, such as jet formation from an ac-
cretion disk, propagation of jets, and so on, using supercom-
puters (e.g., Shibata & Uchida 1985; Matsumoto et al. 1996;
Nakamura et al. 2006). We learned jet mechanisms closely from
the simulations, and can perform new jet simulations. This is
Japan’s advantage for AGN jet science. Speciﬁcally, we already
have (and can newly generate) numerical data which could com-
pare to the data of future SKA observations. From the compar-
ison, we will address various unsolved problems on AGN jets
such as the acceleration mechanism, the acceleration spot, the
composition, and the correlation with environment.

For example, by numerical simulation, we have demon-
strated the basic jet structure: vertical magnetic ﬁelds domi-
nate around the jet axis while toroidal magnetic ﬁelds surround
the jet.
In other word, jets consist of two layers – an inner
high speed region and an outer slow outﬂow, called “spine”
and “sheath”, respectively. Such numerical simulations were
calculated under various initial conditions, such as initial con-
ﬁguration of magnetic ﬁelds or distribution of ambient matter.
From the simulations, we learned that the structure of surround-
ing magnetic ﬁelds, particularly near a front edge of the jet,
depends on the jet launch mechanism. The primary jet launch
mechanism is then related to the initial structure (e.g., toroidal,
poloidal, and vertical) of magnetic ﬁelds in an accretion disk.
These mean that we can get information about the initial condi-
tion of jet launch, from the observed, evolved jet structure.

We,

therefore, examine the structure of magnetic ﬁelds
around the jet with the SKA. From comparison between obser-
vational data and numerical results, we could get information
about the initial condition of jet launch, e.g.
initial magnetic
ﬁelds in an accretion disk. Such information is essential for dis-
cussing several unknown processes such as how to launch jets,
how to collimate jets, where is the accelerating point, and so on.
In order to achieve this work, we need to observe jet structure,
and hence we choose FR-type galaxies for our targets.

We have already started observational visualization (Stokes
parameters and RM) of numerical data (Uchida et al. 2004;
Kigure et al. 2004; Morita et al. 2016). We will obtain the best-
ﬁt model of initial magnetic-ﬁeld structure and be able to pull up

information of magnetic ﬁelds inside an accretion disk. We will
also prepare templates of Faraday spectra obtained from numer-
ical results. From comparision between the simulated Faraday
spectra and observed spectra, we will try to understand typical
Faraday spectrum of FR galaxies, especially what is the differ-
ence of Faraday spectra between FRI and FRII.

3.5.2 Use Case: SKAJP-MAG-5 (JET)
We propose observations of nearby FRI and FRII galaxies. We
try to resolve sub arcsec- to arcsec-scale jet structures at ∼ GHz
with the SKA1. Such an angular resolution is about 10 times
better than those of SKA precursors/pathﬁnders. We emphasize
that high-resolution observations can advance not only study of
spatial structures but also study of depolarization and Faraday
tomography. This is because relatively young jets and robes
can possess very large RMs, which lead serious beam depo-
larization and make it difﬁcult to obtain meaningful results if
the beam size is large. Evaluation of the inﬂuence of beam de-
polarization will be a key to correctly extract physical quanti-
ties from comparison between observational data and numerical
ones. Fortunately, we expect that the number of observed FR
galaxies will increase dramatically in the SKA era, we will be
able to examine the inﬂuence with many samples statistically.

From 71 FRI and 466 FRII galaxies in the combined NVSS-
FIRST sample (CoNFIG), we choose 18 FRI and 12 FRII galax-
ies. Our selection criteria are (i) the spectral index is known,
(ii) the Galactic longitude less that +44◦, (iii) the 1.4 GHz ﬂux
larger than ∼ 1 Jy, and (iv) the redshift less than 0.1.

The standard observing procedure (scheduling of calibrator
and target observations) and standard data reduction (calibra-
tion, RFI ﬂagging, and imaging) can be adopted. Each of our
30 targets is observed with a single pointing, since the nearby
FR galaxies can be covered with a FOV of 48′.5 (SKA1-MID
Band-2). We are proposing deeper observations than the all-sky
Band-2 survey. Data of the all-sky Band-2 survey will be help-
ful for us to tune up our observing strategy, e.g. we can adjust

14

Japan SKA Consortium (2016)

an observing time for each target.

We note that it is difﬁcult to spatially resolve magnetic-ﬁeld
structures in an accretion disk. Therefore, we will refer X-ray
observations and/or numerical simulations, when we will need
to specify properties of the accretion disk.

3.6 Observations of 20 Radio Mini-Halos

3.6.1 Objective
Radio mini-halos are diffuse radio synchrotron emissions ob-
served around the cores of galaxy clusters. Contrary to cluster-
scale radio halos, the mini-halos are often observed in non-
merging clusters (Ferretti et al. 2012; Giacintucci et al. 2014).
This suggests that the origin of the mini-halos is different from
that of cluster-scale radio halos. Since mini-halos are gener-
ally dim, the unprecedented sensitivity of the SKA is expected
to play an important role to reveal the origin of the mini-halos.
For example, the mini-halos have been found in only a fraction
of clusters. We do not know whether mini-halos are too dim to
detect in most clusters or they are totally absent in them. SKA
observations will be able to distinguish the two possibilities.

Japan has an advantage in the research of magnetic ﬁelds
and CRs in clusters, because intensive multi-wavelength obser-
vations have been planned. Thus, we propose multi-wavelength
observations of the mini-halos using the SKA and other tele-
scopes. First, the Japanese X-ray satellite with international col-
laboration, Hitomi (Astro-H), has a superb spectral resolution,
and it can detect the Doppler-shift of hot ICM with the resolu-
tion of < 100km s−1 (Kitayama et al. 2014). This will enable
us to measure turbulence in the ICM (Ota et al. 2015; ZuHone
et al. 2015).

Although the sensitivity of Hitomi is not too high, turbulence
in cluster cores should be detected because the cores are bright
enough. The information of the turbulence can be compared
with detailed radio observations of mini-halos obtained with the
SKA. For example, if a synchrotron-emitting region is found
to be turbulent, primary CR electrons accelerated in the turbu-
lence are likely to be responsible for the synchrotron emission
(ZuHone et al. 2013). Moreover, by comparing the distribution
of turbulence, synchrotron emissions, and Faraday rotation, we
may be able to discuss the ampliﬁcation of magnetic ﬁelds in
the turbulence. On the other hand, if there is no correlation be-
tween turbulence and synchrotron emissions, it may mean that
the emissions come from secondary CR electrons created via
interaction between CR protons and ICM protons (e.g., Fujita
& Ohira 2012). Combined analysis of radio spectra obtained
with the SKA and hard X-ray spectra obtained with Hitomi will
reveal the energy spectra of CRs and magnetic ﬁeld strength in
the mini-halos.

Besides, optical weak-lensing observations with Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru telescope will tell us the

distribution of matter in clusters (Miyazaki et al. 2015).
If a
cluster has an irregular matter distribution, it means that the
cluster is in the merging process and turbulence is likely to be
excited in the ICM. If mini-halos are produced by secondary
electrons, gamma-rays associated with the proton-proton inter-
action may be observed with Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)
(Actis et al. 2011). By comparing the above observations with
SKA observations, our knowledge about mini-halos will be im-
proved dramatically.

3.6.2 Use Case: SKAJP-MAG-6 (CMH)
In order to identify the origin, we observe radio mini-halos in
galaxy clusters. We study spatial distributions, spectra, and po-
larization properties of the mini-halos, and compare them with
theoretical predictions (e.g., Fujita & Ohira 2013, Fig. 10). If
mini-halos are generated by secondary electrons, the radio pro-

Japan SKA Consortium (2016)

ﬁles should be well correlated with X-ray proﬁles of the ICM
(Fujita & Ohira 2013). Otherwise, if mini-halos are generated
by primary electrons, the correlation between the radio pro-
ﬁles and the X-ray proﬁles should be weak, while the radio
emission should be correlated with turbulence (ZuHone et al.
2013). Spectra can be used to estimate the age of CR electrons.
Polarization properties such as the polarization angle and polar-
ization degree can be used to ﬁnd the conﬁguration of magnetic
ﬁelds.

We suppose that we have mini-halo candidates in the all-sky
Band-2 survey catalog and we select 20 best targets from the
candidates. The project (each LOW and MID2) can be divided
into 20 scheduling blocks for the 20 targets (Giacintucci et al.
2014) and the standard observing procedure can be adopted. A
table of band-pass and gain/phase calibrators must be available.
Each target is observed with a single pointing, since a typical
size of mini-halos, 1 arc minute, can be covered with a FoV of
6.28 (LOW) and 0.75 (MID2) square degrees. We have adopted
a radio mini-halo in RX J1347.5-1145 as a representative tar-
get, and have estimated a total observing time using the ﬂux
density of the mini-halo. The total observing time hence varies
for actual targets selected.

3.7 Deep Spectral Index Mapping of 6 Radio Halos

3.7.1 Objective
Radio halos are known as diffuse synchrotron emission of Mpc
extent. The surface brightness is low (∼ 0.1 – 1 µJy/arcsec2 at
ν = 1.4 GHz), and the spectral index is steep (α∼ 1 – 2) (Ferretti
et al. 2012). The magnetic ﬁeld strength is estimated to be ∼ 0.1
– 1 µG. It is considered that ﬂuctuations seen in the surface
brightness reﬂect the structure of magnetic ﬁelds. While spatial
distributions of radio and X-ray emission tend to be similar each
other in giant, regular radio halos, such association is not often
seen in small, irregular radio halos. The difference could relate
to the origin of radio halos, e.g. details of merger dynamics.
Almost radio halos are observed in galaxy clusters which are
undergoing sub-cluster merging.

The origin of CR electrons responsible for the radio emis-
sion is still under debate. The CR electrons can diffuse out
from a point source for a distance of the diffusion velocity vd
times the CR life time τ . The inverse Compton energy loss
time of CR electrons which radiate at ν ∼ several ×100 MHz is
τ ∼ 0.1 Gyr. The diffusion velocity would be the Alfv´en veloc-
ity ∼ 100 km/s. The diffusion distance is, therefore, ∼ 10 kpc,
which does not seem as large as the radio halo extent. This prob-
lem suggests CR injection and/or acceleration in the ICM. One
possible mechanism is the particle acceleration by intracluster
magnetic turbulence generated through sub-cluster mergers.

X-ray and radio observations for radio-halo clusters indicate
a positive correlation between X-ray luminosity and monochro-

matic radio power at 1.4 GHz. In addition, the hotter clusters
tend to have ﬂatter radio spectra. These correlations suggest the
particle acceleration is related with ICM dynamics (Brunetti et
al. 2001; Ohno et al. 2002; Fujita et al. 2003). Sub-cluster merg-
ers would supply energy both to the hot gas and the non-thermal
particles through shocks and derived turbulence.

Depolarization and Faraday tomography will be possible
through wide-band observations with the SKA. Measurements
with depolarization and Faraday tomography can enable us to
study three dimensional magnetic ﬁeld structures in radio-halo
clusters. Furthermore, the X-ray satellite Hitomi would reveal
ICM turbulence in the veolcity space with its high spectral res-
olution. These new observations will bring signiﬁcant progress
in understanding the evolution of the magnetic turbulence in the
ICM and the particle acceleration during sub-cluster merging.

3.7.2 Use Case: SKAJP-MAG-7 (CHL)
We propose deep observations of radio halos in six galaxy clus-
ters so as to elucidate magnetic turbulence and particle acceler-
ation in the clusters. We focus on the spectral index of the emis-
sion, because its spatial distribution correlates with the spatial
distribution of the magnetic turbulence power spectrum, based
on the fact that the power spectrum gives the acceleration rate
and then the acceleration determines the spectral index with
competing with energy loss. Therefore, the goal is to obtain
spectral index maps of the radio halo emission, and then ex-
amine magnetic turbulence and particle acceleration using the
maps and theoretical predictions. Polarization properties such
as the polarization angle and degree can be also clues of the
conﬁguration of magnetic ﬁelds. We compare six radio halos to
elucidate universality and diversity of magnetic turbulence and
particle acceleration in galaxy clusters.

The project can be divided into many scheduling blocks and

16

Japan SKA Consortium (2016)

the standard observing procedure can be adopted. We do imag-
ing with a ∼ 15′′ pixel resolution to resolve structures with the
physical scale down to 50 – 70 kpc, which corresponds to the
diffusion distance of relativistic electrons (the Alfv´en veloc-
ity of ∼ 100 km/s and the energy loss time of ∼ 0.1 Gyr) for
our representative target 1E0657-56 located at z ∼ 0.3. We are
proposing deeper observations than the all-sky Band-2 survey.
Data of the all-sky Band-2 survey will be helpful for us to tune
up our observing strategy, e.g. we can adjust an observing time
for each target.

We realize that some of observations in this use case require
the integration time more than a few hundred hours (Table 10).
This implies that we must require a high calibration stability
throughout a few weeks. We also need to check the confusion
limit for such ultra-deep observations, though it might not be
critical at the ∼ 15′′ resolution. With SKA2, we will be able to
perform the similar observations with much shorter integration
time (∼ several hours).

3.8 High Frequency Emission of 20 Radio Relics

3.8.1 Objective
It is believed that CR electrons in radio relics are acceler-
ated at shocks associated with cluster formation (Enßlin et
al. 1998; Fujita & Sarazin 2001), which is consistent with
the facts that signiﬁcant fractional polarization is often ob-
served and that shock structures are found in X-ray observations
(Akamatsu & Kawahara 2013). Diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) (Blandford & Ostriker 1978; Blandford & Eichler 1987)
is the most promising acceleration process, where a radio spec-
tral index is determined from the shock properties. However,
the CR electrons lose their energy within a short time and their
spectrum changes with the positions behind the shock. Because
their characteristic spatial scales can be smaller than the beam
size, the data can be degraded because of the low resolution ob-
servations. Actually, a spectral index unaffected by the cooling
is obtained only for a few relics (van Weeren et al. 2010). In
addition, two problems, which might be caused by this effect,
are known as follows; (i) Radio and X-ray observations lead
to shock properties inconsistent with each other (Itahana et al.
2015). (ii) Low Mach number shocks (M < 5), which are sug-
gested by the radio and X-ray, cannot explain the radio intensity.
We propose wideband and high spatial resolution radio po-
larimetric observations of relics with the SKA. It is crucial to
observe the spectra in the lower frequency bands, which are less
inﬂuenced by the cooling. Observations in higher frequency
bands are also important to know cooling processes and the
highest energy of the electrons. Thus, very wideband and high
spatial resolution observations are needed, which can be per-
formed only by the SKA.

and DIOS is expected. Wide FOV and large effective area of the
SKA will enable us to reveal dependence of the relic statistics
on the redshift. Even in the era of SKA pathﬁnders, two thou-
sands of relics would be found within z < 0.5 (Nuza et al. 2012).
Combination of the SKA with X-ray will enable us to estimate
how energy relevant to cluster mergers are divided into various
channels in a cosmological time scale, which is one of the most
important keys to understand structure formation. Similar dis-
cussion is expected in radio halo studies.

We can study 3D structures of the ﬁelds with Faraday to-
mography technique for high spatial resolution data little af-
fected by the beam depolarization. High fractional polarization
(50 – 60 %) is observed in some relics. Considering the fore-
ground magnetic ﬁeld, their intrinsic value is likely even higher.
This suggests the ordered magnetic ﬁelds in a Mpc scale. How
such structures form might be a clue to understand the evolu-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld in clusters and large scale structures.
It is expected we can remove the foreground magnetic ﬁelds ef-
fects with depolarization analysis. In addition, combined with
3D structures revealed with the tomography, we can study their
origin and properties in more detail.

3.8.2 Use Case: SKAJP-MAG-8 (CLC)
We propose observations of 20 radio relics with SKA1-MID
Band-5. A radio spectral shape in a high frequency part pro-
vides us with useful information about a high energy part of the
cosmic-ray electron spectrum, which can constrain the parti-
cle acceleration processes and magnetic ﬁelds in the radio relic.
We search for a break or cut-off of the radio spectra in a higher
frequency part. Polarization properties such as the polarization
angle and polarization degree can be used to ﬁnd the conﬁgura-
tion of magnetic ﬁelds. We compare the high frequency feature
of 20 radio relics to elucidate universality and diversity of ac-
celeration mechanisms in radio relics.

The standard observing procedure can be adopted. The
project can be divided into 40 scheduling blocks for the 20 tar-
gets with appropriate mosaicking strategy, where each target is
observed with two pointings. For instance, our representative
target (toothbrush radio relic, z=0.225 van Weeren et al. 2012)
extends over 2′×8′, while one side of the FoV is 6.6′ at Band-5.
Note that antenna baselines of ∼ 30 m would provide the max-

imum angular scale of 3′.6 at 9200 MHz (Govoni et al. 2014).
Data of the all-sky Band-2 survey is essential; we suppose that
we have radio-relic candidates in the survey catalog and we se-
lect 20 best targets from the candidates.

3.9 Magnetic Turbulence in 42 Nearby Galaxy

Clusters

3.9.1 Objective
Three dimensional structures of cluster magnetic ﬁelds can be
complicated due to turbulence.
It is nontrivial to reconstruct
magnetic turbulence from projected observables such as syn-
chrotron emission and Faraday rotation. Comparison between
observed data and theoretical models is helpful for resolving
the complexity. The comparison also makes quantiﬁcation of
magnetic ﬁelds easy. While simple models of uniform, random
magnetic ﬁelds have been considered in the literature, more
sophisticated models were proposed recently (Enßlin & Vogt
2003; Murgia et al. 2004). The models assume random gaus-
sian ﬁelds and the spatial power spectrum with cutoffs at the
minimum and maximum scales. They also assume a correlation
between the gas density and magnetic-ﬁeld strength. Such mod-
els allow to quantify magnetic ﬁelds in detail from statistics of
observed RMs; Kolmogorov-like turbulence was suggested to
be present (Guidetti et al. 2008).

Although studies for individual clusters will advance our un-
derstanding of the nature of magnetic ﬁelds, it would be insufﬁ-
cient to elucidate the evolution history of them. More strategic
investigation is required to address the time domain, and obser-
vational tests of theoretical hypotheses could become a power-
ful probe. Here, whatever the origin is, cluster magnetic ﬁelds
should be affected by turbulence induced by cluster mergers,
motions of cluster galaxies, and AGN. Cluster magnetic ﬁelds
should be also altered, when radiative-cooling inﬂows of the
gas take place in the cluster center. Therefore, we suspect that
magnetic turbulence correlates with cluster morphology.

Motivated by the dynamo theory (e.g., Ryu et al. 2008), we
construct a theoretical hypothesis and test it with SKA obser-
vations. Our hypothesis is that X-ray morphology indicates the
“age” of the cluster. Up to now, galaxy clusters have been clas-
siﬁed into irregular, regular, and cool-core types according to
the characteristics of X-ray surface brightness and temperature.
We regard these types as features in different evolution stages:
merger, relaxation, and cooling, in this order. Each stage may
correspond to ampliﬁcation, saturation, and decay of turbulence
in the context of dynamo action. If this is the case, clusters with
different X-ray morphologies should represent different proper-
ties of magnetic ﬁelds, and we can statistically examine it once
we have a sufﬁcient number of samples. So far, there are over
100 clusters whose X-ray morphology are known (Mohr et al.
1999; Ota, & Mitsuda 2001; Akahori & Masai 2005). Radio

counterparts are, however, very limited. We need SKA’s amaz-
ing sensitivity to study all of these clusters. If our hypothesis
is proven by SKA observations, it provide us important sugges-
tions of co-evolution of the ICM with magnetic ﬁelds and origin
of the cluster magnetic ﬁelds.

Our focus on magnetic turbulence matches quite well with
depolarization and Faraday tomography, because they can be
sensitive to the expected RM dispersion of several tens rad m−2
at the SKA observing frequency (Fig. 1). We have already
carried out JVLA pilot observations of six galaxy clusters with
different X-ray morphologies. Although our analysis is still in
progress, our ﬁrst release for Abell 2256 (Ozawa et al. 2015,
Fig. 11) successfully demonstrated that depolarization is useful
to examine turbulent magnetic ﬁelds and Faraday tomography
has the potential to resolve multiple components along the LOS.

3.9.2 Use Case: SKAJP-MAG-9 (CTB)
We propose observations of the 42 nearby galaxy clusters whose
X-ray morphologies are known and their declinations are less
than the limit, +44◦. We systematically explore synchrotron
emission and polarization from these clusters as well as polar-
ized sources embedded in/behind these clusters. We examine
polarization properties such as the polarization angle, the frac-

as irregular and cool-core structures, we classify the 42 clus-
ters into some categories (irregular, regular, cool-core, Bautz-
Morgan type, etc) and compare radio properties among the cat-
egories. From the comparisons, we argue the evolution of mag-
netic turbulence. SKA1-MID Band-2 provides the best speci-
ﬁcation; a high resolution (1′′ ∼ 1 kpc in average), a sufﬁcient
image size (49′ ∼ 3 Mpc one side), and a satisfactory maximum
angular scale (20′ ∼ 1.2 Mpc at 1355 MHz for antenna base-
lines of ∼ 30 m).

standard observing procedure

adopted.
Observations of the clusters toward which no radio emission
is reported from the all-sky Band-2 survey may be cancelled.
In order to identify the contribution to the RM from the fore-
ground and background, Faraday tomography with multi fre-
quency observations would be very promising. It is also impor-
tant to interpret the Faraday spectra which are calculated from
the observed and theoretical data to understand the evolution
of the turbulent magnetic ﬁelds. Therefore, with I, Q, and U,
Faraday synthesis is carried out followed by Faraday RM clean
with standard parameters. In addition, for each source, Q, and
U are ﬁtted with several FDF models by means of an MCMC
method, where the result of RM clean is used as an initial guess.
Here, a 10 MHz channel provides a maximum Faraday depth of
about 4350 rad m−2 at 1355 MHz.

3.10 Extraction of RM in the LSS

3.10.1 Objective
We focus on RM due to the IGMF in the large-scale structure
(LSS) rather than synchrotron emission from the LSS, based
on previous works by Japanese researchers. As already de-
scribed in §2.7, the IGMF would be very weak (see also §3.11).
Hence it is not easy to estimate only the IGMF in a single LOS,
since individual contributions of external polarized source, our
galaxy, and so on, to RM are not negligible in general.
It is
valid to adopt statistical approaches to remove such contribu-
tions. Moreover, the statistics such as average, variance and
second-order structure function of RMs would have some char-
acteristics of RM due to the IGMF. The Japan’s advantage for
the study is that we have a theoretical model of the IGMF and
abundant knowledge about foreground and background compo-
nents introduced in the previous sections. Our goal is to extract
the characteristics after choosing ideal polarized sources from
an enormous number of background sources, by means of the
methods proposed below.

We have already simulated the estimation of the IGMF,
where model RM maps are constructed following previous
works. Akahori et al. (2014b) randomly allocated polarized
sources on the plane of the sky accordance with the redshift dis-
tribution of observed polarized sources, and chose half of them

at random as the one without intervening galaxies based on the
observed statistics. Then, they further removed the sources with
z < 2, for which the intrinsic RMs can be signiﬁcant, as well as
the one including galaxy clusters along the LOS. After that, they
chose the sources with small observational errors. Finally, they
applied a high-pass ﬁlter to remove Galactic foreground RM. As
a result, it is found that the variance of RM of the IGMF can be
estimated with sufﬁcient accuracy with the statistics obtained by
POSSUM, the polarization survey planned with ASKAP (100
polarized sources per 1 square degree with the sensitivity of a
few µJy/beam, Fig. 12). The POSSUM would be, however, hard
to reveal the structure function of the IGMF (Fig. 12). We re-
quire the SKA’s dense RM grids to ﬁnd a typical scale of the
structure of the IGMF.

Faraday tomography has the potential to separate foreground
and background along a LOS (e.g., Anderson et al. 2015) and

extract RM of only the IGMF. However, as introduced in the
previous section, it is necessary to understand the best situation
of observation, and to interpret the reconstructed Faraday spec-
tra. In other words, understanding the nature of depolarization
and Faraday tomography on this speciﬁc subject is essential.
Akahori et al. (2014a) discussed the possible methodology for
estimating RM of the IGMF using Faraday tomography. Their
idea is to observe a distant polarized source through the Galaxy
and to measure RM of the IGMF as the gap of FDF (Fig. 13).
They simulated some situations with a simple model. They
found that, if the RM of the IGMF is larger than ∼ 10 rad m−2,
the gap will be detectable directly from the FDF within a factor
of 2 in the SKA era. Moreover, Ideguchi et al. (2014b) found
that a model ﬁtting method called QU-ﬁt (as it execute ﬁtting us-
ing stoke Q and U) is capable to estimate the IGMF with SKA
precursors such as ASKAP even if the RM is ∼ 5 rad m−2.

The key requirements to perform the methods described
above is (i) to obtain an enormous number of background polar-
ized sources that allow us to ﬁnd ideal sources, and (ii) to obtain
wideband polarization spectra that allows us to further examine
ideal sources by means of depolarization and Faraday tomogra-
phy. In order to clear these requirements, we need to carry out
wideband all-sky polarization surveys.

3.10.2 Use Case: SKAJP-MAG-10 (LSS)
We propose the Band-1 polarization survey as a follow-up of
the Band-2 survey. As mentioned above, one of our strategy
for ﬁnding the IGMF is to observe a distant polarized source
through the Galaxy. The Faraday thin source is suitable for ﬁnd-
ing RM of the IGMF as the gap of FDF. Since lower frequency
observation has better sensitivity for the Faraday thin sources,
the Band-1 survey is essential to prove the IGMF. The polariza-

tion information with broader frequency coverage also allows
us to obtain the sensitivity of Faraday structure as well as more
precise RM estimation if the situation has the simple Faraday
structure.

In concert with the Band-2 survey, the beam size is selected
to 2′′ × 2′′. For the image rms level, we require 16 µJy/beam
with 210 MHz bandwidth based on the Band-2 survey with
taken into account the typical radio galaxies (α ∼ −1). We ﬁ-
nally request 418 hours on-source observing time. The project
can be divided into many scheduling blocks and the standard
observing procedure can be adopted. The project could be com-
mensal with HI, cosmology, and continuum survey. In this case,
we need to consult with these survey teams about observing
strategy.

We will perform the standard polarization analysis. Here,
once a source is detected, the bandwidth is recursively divided
by half down to the 1 MHz channel or down to the detection
limit so as to gain spectroscopic data. Here, a 1 MHz channel
provides a maximum Faraday depth of about 5000 rad m−2 at
700 MHz. For a given Stokes I, Q, and U, the estimation of
RM and Faraday tomography are performed. The correlation
of the LSS with RM and Faraday structure is investigated. In
addition, for the interested situation where there seems to be the
IGMF, the more sophisticated method such as the QU-ﬁtting
with the replica exchange MCMC algorithm is applied for the
more detailed study.

3.11 Cosmological Magnetic Fields

3.11.1 Objective
Our ultimate question of cosmic magnetism would be “What is
the seed of Universe’s magnetic ﬁelds?”. Although the question
is yet far beyond the scopes of any observational projects, theo-
rists have addressed this frontier. We summarize some of major
possible origins of Universe’s magnetic ﬁelds below (see Ryu
et al. 2012; Widrow et al. 2012 for reviews).
• Inﬂation Era: Since electromagnetic ﬁeld is conformal
transformation invariant,
there is the principle that elec-
tromagnetic quantum ﬂuctuation cannot be generated in
the standard inﬂation model. Hence, beyond the standard
model, magnetic-ﬁeld generation in the inﬂation era has
been argued together with the additional scalar ﬁeld such as
Dilaton (Bamba & Yokoyama 2004) and Higgs (Prokopec
& Puchwein 2004), as well as the ﬁeld of gravity (Turner
& Widrow 1988). They can generate largest-scale coherent
magnetic ﬁelds but with tiny amplitude of 10−15 – 10−25 G
at the present epoch. There are signiﬁcant contributions
from Japanese researches (Kanno et al. 2009; Suyama &
Yokoyama 2012; Fujita & Yokoyama 2014), in particular, to

be suppressed at largest scales; B <
∼ 10−30 G at Mpc for the

20

Japan SKA Consortium (2016)

simplest f 2(φ)FµνF µν type models (Ferreira et al. 2014).

• Reheating and phase transition Era: There is, on the other
hand, no problem on suppression of largest magnetic ﬁelds
in the ﬁeld generation at cosmic reheating (Kobayashi 2014)
and/or phase transition (Hogan 1983; Vachaspati 1991).
Kahniashvili et al. (2013) argued that the ﬁeld with strength
and coherence length of 10−9 G and ∼50 kpc can be gener-
ated at QCD phase transition, and 10−10 G and ∼0.3 kpc at
QED phase transition, respectively. These generate signiﬁ-
cant power at small scales, compared to those in the inﬂation
era.

• Recombination Era: Magnetic ﬁelds can be generated at
cosmological recombination (Takahashi et al. 2005; Ichiki et
al. 2006). In the primordial plasma, frequent Thomson scat-
tering can separate electrons from protons and lead gener-
ation of electric ﬁelds for the protons to catch up with the
electrons. The induced electric ﬁelds can then generate mag-
netic ﬁelds according to the Maxwell equations.

• First-Star and EoR Era: Likewise, the electric ﬁeld can
be also induced by UV radiation from the ﬁrst-generation
stars as well as by CRs produced by supernova explosion of
the ﬁrst-generation stars (Gnedin et al. 2000; Langer et al.
2005; Ando, Doi, & Susa 2010; Miniati & Bell 2011). Such
seed ﬁelds generated before the large-scale structure forma-
tion would evolve to O(1 – 100) nG magnetic ﬁelds in ﬁla-
ments (Dubois & Teyssier 2008).

• Galaxy-Evolution Era: Undoubtable sources of magnetic
ﬁelds are instabilities and dynamo actions in galaxies (e.g.,
Machida et al. 2013).
It is likely that magnetic ﬁelds
and CRs escape from galaxies into the intergalactic space
through jets, supernovae, winds, and ram pressure stripping.
Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation suggest that
the leakage result in B ∼ 0.1 – 10 µG in galaxy clusters
(Donnert et al. 2009; Xu et al. 2009; Stasyszyn et al. 2010).
• Structure-Formation Era: Cosmological shock waves in
the structure formation can generate seed magnetic ﬁelds by
the Biermann battery (Ryu, Kang, & Biermann 1998), the
Wibel instability (Okabe & Hattori 2003), and plasma insta-
bility (Fujita & Kato 2005). Seed magnetic ﬁelds of any ori-
gins could be further ampliﬁed through compression and tur-
bulence dynamo. A conservative range of the resultant IGMF
in ﬁlaments would be O(1 – 100) nG (Ryu et al. 2008), with
the coherence length O(100) kpc (Cho & Ryu 2009).

Some of the SKA-JP Magnetism SWG members have inves-
tigated generation of magnetic ﬁelds at cosmological recombi-
nation (Takahashi et al. 2005; Ichiki et al. 2006). Here, the key
point to note is that the electric ﬁelds should have rotation com-
ponent to generate magnetic ﬁelds (Harrison 1970). Therefore
the standard density perturbations can not be responsible for the
generation of magnetic ﬁelds at ﬁrst order. For a possible gen-
eration of magnetic ﬁelds based on the standard cosmological

perturbation theory, we need to go beyond the ﬁrst order or con-
sider an external source such as textures and cosmic strings to
generate vector mode perturbations. Because the cosmological
perturbation theory is well established, we can make a ﬁrm pre-
diction about the amplitude and the spectrum of the generated
magnetic ﬁelds.

In Fig. 14 we show some examples of magnetic ﬁeld spectra
at recombination. The amplitude of generated magnetic ﬁelds
from second order density perturbations can reach at most B ≈
10−23 Gauss on k = 0.5h Mpc−1 scale at z = 500 (Saga et al.
2015), while the magnetic ﬁelds from texture of cosmic string
can be as large as 10−20 Gauss (Horiguchi et al. 2015). We ﬁnd
that the amplitude is too small to directly explain the magnetic
ﬁelds observed today, but these ﬁelds might be a seed for the
subsequent dynamo ampliﬁcation.

3.12 Advancing Faraday Tomography

3.12.1 Objective
Faraday tomography is a powerful way to probe 3D structure of
galaxies and intergalactic magnetic ﬁelds (Akahori et al. 2014a;
Ideguchi et al. 2014a). However, this method needs a broadband
polarimetry and has been studied only recently. We are doing
studies related to both the practical application and fundamental
properties of Faraday tomography.

We are developing a software of Faraday tomography and
it has already been incorporated into the pipeline of POSSUM,
which is an all-sky polarization survey of ASKAP. The soft-
ware is based on QU-ﬁtting where the Faraday spectrum is as-
sumed to be a combination of Gaussian functions and is ﬁtted
to the observed polarization spectrum. The ﬁtting is performed
by Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and, as a result of the
ﬁtting, the model parameters such as the Faraday depths, am-
plitudes, polarization angle and widths of the Gaussian compo-
nents are obtained. Using information criteria such as AIC and
BIC, the number of Gaussian components is determined.

In the SKA era, the number of polarized objects to be an-
alyzed is enormous so that the computational cost must be re-
duced as much as possible. Furthermore, the conventional in-

with the presence of multiple sources located closely in the
Faraday depth space (Sun et al. 2015; Nakagawa et al. 2016). To
solve these problems, we are planning to improve our software
with adopting a more sophisticated algorithm such as replica
exchange method.

In utilizing QU-ﬁtting, the functional form of the model of
Faraday spectrum is a critical assumption. The realistic form of
the Faraday spectrum was studied by calculating it from galac-
tic models (Ideguchi et al. 2014b, Fig. 15) and it was shown
that the Faraday spectrum of Galaxies can be very complicated
and cannot be approximated by Gaussian or other simple ana-
lytic function. The complexity is mainly due to the stochasticity
of turbulence in magnetic ﬁelds and gas density. Tashiro et al.
2015 showed that the stochasticity can be signiﬁcantly reduced
by using a large beam and the global properties of galaxies such
as coherent magnetic ﬁelds and characteristic scale of turbu-
lence could be extracted from the Faraday spectrum.

Finally, RM CLEAN is another standard method of Faraday
tomography. This method does not need any assumption on
the functional form of Faraday spectrum. However, due to lim-
ited frequency coverage, it is difﬁcult to reconstruct Faraday
spectrum especially when multiple polarized sources are lo-
cated closely in Faraday depth space (Kumazaki et al. 2014). In
Miyashita et al. 2015, we proposed the chi-square value calcu-
lated from the observed polarization spectrum and the result of
RM CLEAN as a criterion for judging if RM CLEAN is work-
ing well or not.

4 Summary

The origin and evolution of cosmic magnetism is one of the
fundamental questions in modern astrophysics. Centimeter and
meter radio observation is an established method to study mag-

netic ﬁelds. We, SKA-JP Magnetism SWG, consider that it is
important to investigate magnetic ﬁelds in various astronomical
objects. We expect that depolarization and Faraday tomogra-
phy, which will become applicable in the SKA era, allow us to
resolve magnetic ﬁelds in the four dimensional space, improv-
ing our understanding of magnetic ﬁelds dramatically. We sug-
gest that the SKA should possess supreme sensitivity and wide
frequency coverage to enhance the study of depolarization and
Faraday tomography. More speciﬁcally, we request the follow-
ing “core” speciﬁcations of the SKA.

• Continuous bandwidth of at least 0.3 – 3 GHz: The fre-
quency coverage is an essential speciﬁcation for depolariza-
tion and Faraday tomography. Although it can be achieved by
performing multiple observations with narrow simultaneous
bandwidths, it is much preferable to deploy a few wideband
single pixel feeds (WBSPFs) or several phased array feeds
(PAFs) so as to dramatically improve the efﬁciency of the
survey. It would be also effective to adopt a sampler which is
possible to sample data unevenly in frequency and evenly in
frequency-squared.

• All-sky 1 µJy survey + 400 deg2 0.1 µJy deep ﬁelds: Our
use cases can be summarized into two big survey projects -
all-sky survey and deep survey toward high galactic latitudes.
With SKA2-MID (0.5 deg2 FoV), all-sky 1 µJy sensitivity
survey can be achieved in ∼ 1000 hours. With a similar ob-
serving time, we can perform deep ﬁelds of 0.1 µJy for in
total 400 deg2 FoV toward North and South Galactic poles.
Such a long-time survey can only be allowed as a KSP under
the current operation concept of the SKA. In order to carry
out any KSP as a principle investigator, we have to join the
SKA project as a full member.

• Angular resolution of 0.1 arcsecond at 1 GHz: A high an-
gular resolution can relax beam depolarization and increase
the possibility to detect more polarized sources. Such an im-
provement is beneﬁcial on the studies of MHD turbulence in
the Milky Way and galaxy clusters. The SKA1 will provide
about 1′′ resolution at 1 GHz by the maximum baseline of
∼ 100 km. In order to provide distinguished progress from
SKA1 to SKA2, the SKA2 should achieve 0.′′1 resolution at
1 GHz, corresponding maximum baseline of ∼ 1, 000 km.

• Largest angular scale of 1 degree at 3 GHz: With the min-
imum baseline 20 meter at zenith, the largest angular scale is
around 30′ at 1.5 GHz. This limit may not be a serious matter
for many of sciences we have proposed. However, some sci-
ences addressing diffuse emission may require to detect far
larger-scale structures. In order to remove an uncertainty due
to the missing ﬂux, we request the largest angular scale of 1◦
at 3 GHz. This requirement can be achieved by deploying
dishes with the minimum baseline of a few meter or deploy-
ing a very large single dish. This is beyond the current vision
of the SKA project and could be a Japanese unique proposal.

• Robust and fast science data processor pipeline: It is im-
possible to look around a few hundred million sources manu-
ally, so that development of robust and fast science data pro-
cessor (SDP) pipelines is crucial for the SKA project. We
need to understand how we can make the SDP pipeline ro-
bust, fast, and automated. Because both theory and appli-
cation of Faraday tomography are still less established, we
should be responsible for the development in order that we
can achieve our science cases with Faraday tomography. It
may require substantial funding and human resources.

Finally, we could obtain much more science outcomes from

the following synergies with other large projects.
• HI observations: There is a long history of studying molecu-
lar clouds with Nobeyama 45 m and ALMA. It was suggested
in M33 that magnetic ﬁelds of molecular clouds are aligned
with global magnetic ﬁelds (Li & Henning 2011). On the
other hand, the star formation rate is not correlated to the
strength of regular magnetic ﬁelds but to the strength of ran-
dom magnetic ﬁelds (Tabatabaei et al. 2013). The SKA com-
mensal observations of HI and polarization would be impor-
tant to clarify the impact of global magnetic ﬁelds on small-
scall star formation.

• EoR 21 cm line observations: Synchrotron radiation of the
Milky Way is fatal foreground for examining redshifted HI
lines at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). In meter wave-
length, time variability of Stokes Q and U is huge and hence
calibration of leakages among Stokes I, Q, and U is non-
trivial. Making the Milky Way synchrotron template would
be useful for the studies of both EoR and cosmic magnetism.
• Polarization from the Sun and stars: Magnetic ﬁelds of the
Sun has been studied from observations of circular polariza-
tion with Nobeyama centimeter heliograph (Iwai & Shibasaki
2013). Since the observed characteristic frequency of the po-
larization depends on the altitude of Solar atmosphere, wide-
band imaging allows us to study three dimensional structures
of magnetic ﬁelds and their time variabilities, and we can
clarify relations between magnetic ﬁelds and observed elec-
tromagnetic phenomena. With SKA’s high resolution and
high sensitivity, we could extend such studies into stars.

• Other frequency observations: ALMA will explore mag-
netic ﬁelds of individual objects by measuring dust polariza-
tion and Zeeman effects, while the SKA will provide com-
plementary information of its surrounding. All-sky maps of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiences and the
SKA will be complementary to each other in terms of fre-
quency, and such complementarity can be extended further
to the visible band such as SGMAP, a Japanese optical po-
larimetric survey project. CMB could be even utilized as a
source of polarization for the study of magnetic ﬁelds (Ohno
et al. 2003). X-ray experiences such as Hitomi and DIOS
will provide supportive data to SKA observations for studies

of shocks, turbulence, and CRs in supernova remnants and
galaxy clusters.

• Ultra high energy CRs: Telescope Array (TA) Experience,
which Japan takes part in, recently found that 72 events with
the energy larger than 5.7×1019 eV in the last 5 years are lo-
calized on a speciﬁc sky area (called hot spot) at 3.4σ (99.963
%) signiﬁcance (Abbasi et al. 2014). In addition, CRs above
1018.2 eV are mostly protons. The anisotropy implies deﬂec-
tion of CRs due to magnetic ﬁelds in the Milky way and the
large-scale structure within up to 250 Mpc. Faraday tomog-
raphy with the SKA would be quite helpful to understand the
magnetic ﬁelds and would provide a clue for the origin of
ultra-high energy CRs.
