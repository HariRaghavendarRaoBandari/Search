The Main Eigenvalue of the Ruelle Operator

with a Brownian Type Potential

(L.C.)2

March 10, 2016

Abstract

In this paper, we study the main eigenvalue of the Ruelle operator
associated to a random potential coming from a Brownian motion.
We explicitly compute its exact value and show that it is constant
almost surely. As a consequence we conclude that the annealed and
quenched topological pressure for Brownian type potentials exist and
are equal. We also exhibit an isomorphism between the space C(Ω),
where Ω = {0, 1}N
, endowed with its standard norm, and a proper
closed subspace of the Skorokhod space. Using this isomorphism we
obtain a stochastic functional equation for the main eigenvalue and its
associated eigenfunction.

Introduction

The basic idea of the Ruelle operator is based on the transfer matrix method
introduced by Kramers and Wannier and independently by Montroll to ex-
plicitly compute partition functions in Statistical Mechanics. This operator
was introduced in 1968 by David Ruelle [Rue68] and was used to describe
local to global properties of systems with inﬁnite range interactions. Among
other things, Ruelle used this operator to prove the existence of a unique
DLR-Gibbs measure for a lattice gas system depending on inﬁnitely many
coordinates. The acronym DLR stands for Dobrushin, Lanford and Ruelle.
With the advent of the Markov partitions due to Y. Sinai, remarkable
applications of this operator to uniform hyperbolic dynamical systems on

1

compact manifolds were further obtained by Ruelle, Sinai and Bowen, see
[Rue68, Sin72, Bow08]. Since its creation, this operator remains to have a
great inﬂuence in many ﬁelds of pure and applied Mathematics. It is a power-
ful tool to study invariant measures for Anosov ﬂows, statistical mechanics in
one-dimension, meromorphy of the Zelberg and Ruelle dynamical zeta func-
tions, multifractal analysis and conformal dynamics in one dimension, just
to name a few. For those topics, see [Bar11, Bow08, Bow79, Ma˜n90, MM83,
PP90, Rue02, Sin72] and references therein.
In this paper we would like
to add another item to this list of applications: one-dimensional disordered
systems in Statistical Mechanics with Brownian type potential.

In order to describe our contributions, we shall start by brieﬂy recalling
the classical setting of the Ruelle operator. A comprehensive exposition of
this subject can be found in [Bal00, Bow08, PP90].

We now introduce the state space and the dynamics that will guide the
In this paper, the state space will be the Bernoulli
following discussions.
space Ω = {0, 1}N
and the dynamics is given by σ : Ω → Ω, the left shift
map. When topological concept are concerned, the state space Ω is regarded
as a metric space where the distance between points x and y ∈ Ω is given by

d(x, y) =

1

2N , where N = inf{i ∈ N : xi (cid:54)= yi}.

We shall remark that Ω is a compact metric space when endowed with this
metric. All of the results presented in this paper can be naturally extended to
{0, 1, . . . , m−1}N
, m ≥ 2, but for the sake of simplicity, we restrain ourselves
to the binary case. A summary of the changes required to study this more
general case are presented in Section 7.

Back to the case Ω = {0, 1}N

, the set of all real continuous functions
deﬁned over Ω will be denoted by C(Ω) and the Ruelle transfer operator, or
simply the Ruelle operator, associated to a continuous function f : Ω → R
will be denoted by Lf . This operator acts on the space of all continuous
functions sending ϕ to Lf (ϕ) which is deﬁned for any x ∈ Ω by the following
expression

(cid:88)

Lf (ϕ)(x) =

exp(f (ax))ϕ(ax),

where ax ≡ (a, x1, x2, . . .). The function f is usually called potential.

a=0,1

In this work a major role will be played by the space of γ-H¨older con-
tinuous functions, denoted by C γ(Ω), with the H¨older exponent γ satisfying
0 < γ < 1/2. This space is the set of all functions f : Ω → R satisfying

Hol(f ) = sup

x,y∈Ω: x(cid:54)=y

|f (x) − f (y)|

d(x, y)γ

< +∞.

Equipped with its standard norm (cid:107) · (cid:107)γ given by C γ(Ω) (cid:51) f (cid:55)→ (cid:107)f(cid:107)γ ≡
(cid:107)f(cid:107)∞ + Hol(f ), the space C γ(Ω) is a Banach space, see [PP90] for more
details.

Furthermore, we present the suitable version of the Ruelle-Perron-Fr¨obe-
nius Theorem that will be required for our discussions. See [Bal00, Bow08,
PP90] for a proof.

Theorem A (Ruelle-Perron-Fr¨obenius, RPF). If f is a potential in C γ(Ω)
for some 0 < γ < 1, then Lf : C γ(Ω) → C γ(Ω) have a simple positive eigen-
value of maximal modulus λf with a corresponding strictly positive eigenfunc-
tion hf and a unique Borel probability measure νf on Ω such that,

i) the remainder of the spectrum of Lf : C γ(Ω) → C γ(Ω) is contained in

a disc of radius strictly smaller than λf ;
ii) the probability measure νf satisﬁes L ∗

f (νf ) = λf νf , where L ∗

f denotes

the dual of the Ruelle operator;

iii) for all continuous functions ϕ ∈ C(Ω) we have

Whereas in the classical theory of the Ruelle operator, f is some ﬁxed
H¨older, Walters [Wal07, Bou01] or Bowen [Bow08, Wal01] potential, here we
are interested in obtaining almost certain results for random potentials.
Deﬁnition 1 (Random Potentials). Let (Ψ,F, P) be a complete probability
space. A random potential is a map X : Ψ × Ω → R satisfying for any ﬁxed
x ∈ Ω that ψ (cid:55)→ X(ψ, x) is F-measurable. A random potential X is said to
be a continuous random potential if x (cid:55)→ X(ψ, x) ∈ C(Ω) for P-almost
all ψ ∈ Ψ.

Although some of our results could be stated for a large class of random
potentials, we focus on the random potentials of Brownian type (see the next
section for the deﬁnition of such potentials).

When moving into the realm of random potentials the basic theory of
the Thermodynamic Formalism needs to be reconstructed from scratch. In
[FS88] random potentials were considered and this is the setting of our work.
Latter, more general settings were introduced. The theory was extended to
cover countable random Markov subshifts of ﬁnite type, allowing randomness
to be considered also in the adjacency matrix, we refer the reader to [BG95,

3

Bog96, DKS08, FS88, GK00, Kif08, KL06, MSU11], for this more general
setting.

As mentioned above the randomness here is considered exclusively in the
potential. Since this is simpler setting, for the reader’s convenience we proved
here, in full details for the Brownian potential, that important quantities such
as the spectral radius, the topological pressure and the main eigenvalue of
the Ruelle operator can be associated to random variables with ﬁnite ﬁrst
moment in Wiener spaces. At the end of Section 2 we explain how to obtain
similar results for Brownian potential using the general setting considered in
[Kif08, KL06].

Working with random potentials, we are led to consider questions similar
in spirit to the ones we ask when studying disordered systems in Statistical
Mechanics, for instance the existence of annealed and quenched free energy
and pressure, respectively, see [MPV87]. Here, in Section 6, we obtain the
explicit value for the quenched topological pressure deﬁned by

(note that the existence of the rhs above is itself a deep question) as well as
X(1)(σn(x))] , ∀x ∈ Ω when
the identity P quenched(X) = E [limn→∞ n−1 log L n
the random potential X is a Brownian potential, not invoking the classical
replica trick.

Our main results are Theorems 2, 3 and the existence and explicit com-
putations of the annealed and quenched topological pressures for Brownian
type potentials in Section 6.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the so-called
Brownian potential and we prove that the main eigenvalue for the random
Ruelle operator associated to the Brownian potential almost surely exists.
We also prove in this section the absence of phase transition for this random
potential, in the sense of the Deﬁnition 2.
In Section 3 and 4 we prove
a Banach isomorphism between C(Ω) and a certain closed subspace of the
Skorokhod space, denoted by D[0, 1]. With the help of this isomorphism we
obtain a stochastic functional equation satisﬁed by both the main eigenvalue
and its associated eigenfunction. Section 5 is devoted to obtain the exact
value of main eigenvalue. We prove the surprising fact which is the main
eigenvalue is constant almost surely. This is done by using Birkhoﬀ’s Ergodic

motion to overcome the complex combinatorial problem arising from the

Let {Bt
i.e., a stochastic process with continuous paths almost surely, stationary
independent increments and Bt ∼ N (0, t) for each t ≥ 0, see [KS91, Lig10].
The idea is to use the almost certain continuity of its paths t (cid:55)→ Bt
to deﬁne an almost certain continuous random potential on the symbolic
space Ω = {0, 1}N
. The construction of this random potential is as follows.
We consider the function (abusing notation) t : Ω → [0, 1] from the symbolic
space to the closed unit interval [0, 1], deﬁned for each x ∈ Ω by the expression
n≥1 2−nxn. The Brownian potential is the random mapping from

t(x) =(cid:80)

Ω to R given by

Ω (cid:51) x (cid:55)→ Bt(x).

n := (a1, . . . , an, an, an, . . . )

From the very deﬁnition of the Brownian motion follows that the Brown-
ian potential is almost certain a continuous potential over the symbolic space
Ω. Therefore we have almost certain a well deﬁned Ruelle operator LBt(·)
sending C(Ω) to itself. This “random” operator takes a continuous function

exp(Bt(y))ϕ(y).

LBt(·)(ϕ)(x) =

y∈Ω:σ(y)=x

Note that the rhs of (1) let it clear that LBt(·)(ϕ)(x) is a random variable,

for any choice of x ∈ Ω and ϕ ∈ C(Ω).
Proposition 1. The spectral radius λB of the random Ruelle operator LBt(·)
is a non-negative random variable.

Proof. Of course, the only issue here is about measurability and we show how
to overcome this by using the Gelfand Formula and expression (1). Indeed,
by applying iteratively the expression (1) one can see that L n
(ϕ)(x) is a
random variable for any choice of ϕ ∈ C(Ω) and x ∈ Ω. For any ﬁxed n ∈ N
and ϕ ∈ C(Ω) there exists, by the deﬁnition of the supremum, a sequence
(xk) in Ω such that (cid:107)L n
(ϕ)(xk)| so proving that
(ϕ)(cid:107)∞ is a random variable. Since the Gelfand’s formula ensures that
(cid:107)L n
the spectral radius of LBt(·) is given by

(ϕ)(cid:107)∞ = limk→∞ |L n

we can argue similarly as above to conclude that λB is a random variable.

Theorem 1. The random variable λB is the main eigenvalue of the ran-
dom Ruelle operator LBt(·) almost surely. Moreover this operator has almost
certain a positive continuous eigenfunction hB and, additionally, hB(x) is a
random variable, for each x ∈ Ω.
Proof. A typical trajectory of the Brownian motion in the unit interval [0, 1]
is γ-H¨older continuous function for any γ < 1/2, see [KS91, Lig10]. A simple
computation shows that |t(x) − t(y)| ≤ d(x, y), where d(x, y) = 2−N and
N = inf{n : xj = yj for 1 ≤ j < n and xn (cid:54)= yn}. Therefore almost certain
we have

|Bt(x) − Bt(y)| ≤ const.|t(x) − t(y)|γ ≤ const.(d(x, y))γ.

So our random potentials x (cid:55)→ Bt(x) are almost certain γ-H¨older continuous
for any γ < 1/2. From the classical Ruelle-Perron-Fr¨obenius Theorem follows
that λB, the random spectral radius of LBt(·), is actually the main eigenvalue
and it has geometric multiplicity one almost surely. From item iii) of Theorem
A we have for each x ∈ Ω that

B · L n

Bt(·)

(1)(x) → hB(x).

Since the lhs above is a random variable it follows that hB(x) is also a random
variable.

6

Before proceed we recall some elementary facts about the dual of the
Ruelle operator associated to a deterministic general continuous potential.
As we mentioned before (Ω, d) is a compact metric space so one can apply
the Riesz-Markov Theorem to prove that C∗(Ω) is isomorphic to Ms(Ω), the
space of all signed Radon measures. Therefore we can deﬁne L ∗
f , the dual
of the Ruelle operator, as the unique continuous map from Ms(Ω) to itself
satisfying for each γ ∈ Ms(Ω) the following identity

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

Lf (ϕ) dγ =

Ω

Ω

ϕ d(L ∗

f γ)

∀ϕ ∈ C(Ω).

(2)

f (γ)/L ∗

f (γ)/L ∗

From the positivity of Lf follows that the map γ (cid:55)→ L ∗

f (γ)(1)
sends the space of all Borel probability measures P(Ω) to itself. Since
P(Ω) is convex set and compact in the weak topology (which is Haus-
dorﬀ in this case) and the mapping γ (cid:55)→ L ∗
f (γ)(1) is continuous,
the Tychonoﬀ-Schauder Theorem ensures the existence of at least one Borel
probability measure νf such that L ∗
f (νf )(1)νf . The eigenvalue
λf ≡ L ∗
f (νf )(1) is positive and equals to the spectral radius of Lf and there-
fore independent of the choice of the ﬁxed point νf , see [Bal00, Bow08, PP90].
If X is a continuous random potential, then the Ruelle operator LX
sends C(Ω) to itself almost surely. We claim that for any continuous random
potential X the spectral radius of the operator LX, denoted by λX is a
random variable. In fact, the claim follows from the arguments given in the
proof of Proposition 1 replacing Bt(·) by X.

f (νf ) = L ∗

Deﬁnition 2 (Phase Transition). Let X be a continuous random potential
and λX the random spectral radius of LX. We say that the random potential
X does not present phase transition if the eigenvalue problem L ∗
Xν = λXν
has a unique solution in P(Ω) almost surely. Otherwise, we say that X
presents phase transition.

Corollary 1 (Absence of Phase Transition for Brownian Potentials). Al-
most surely the dual of the Ruelle operator L ∗
has one eigenprobability
associated to λB.

Bt(·)

Proof. From the Theorem 1 follows that λB is both the spectral radius and
the main eigenvalue of LBt(·). So the corollary follows from the almost certain
γ-H¨older continuity of the mapping Ω (cid:51) x (cid:55)→ Bt(x), obtained in the proof of
Theorem 1, together with the item ii) of Theorem A.

The results obtained in this section could be also derived from the ab-
stract theory developed in [Kif08]. Indeed, the basic hypothesis (2.3)–(2.5)
in [Kif08] hold for Brownian potentials since

7

• the reﬂection principle gives E[supx∈Ω Bt(x)] = E[supt∈[0,1] Bt] < +∞;
• for γ ∈ (0, 1/2) the Brownian motion is γ-H¨older continuous and there
is some positive random variable K satisfying for all n ∈ N the inequal-
ity Varn(Bt(·)) ≤ K exp(−(γ log 2)n), where Varn(f ) ≡ sup{f (x) −
f (y) : xi = yi, ∀i < n};

• and the r.v. K := sup{|Bt − Bs|/|t − s|γ : 0 ≤ s, t ≤ 1} has ﬁnite

moments of all orders; see Theorem 10.1 on page 152 in [SP14].

C(Ω) (cid:39) D[0, 1]
3 C(Ω) (cid:39) D[0, 1]
C(Ω) (cid:39) D[0, 1]

Let us denote by D the subset of the unit interval [0, 1] such that all of its
points have exactly two distinct binary expansion representations, i.e.,

D ≡ {s ∈ [0, 1] : #t−1(s) = 2}.

If t(x) ∈ D then there is a unique y ∈ Ω \ {x} such that t(x) = t(y).
Moreover such x and y are always comparable in the lexicographic order.
When x is smaller than y in this order we indicate this by using the notation
x ≺Lex y.

We now introduce a proper subset of the Skorokhod space that will play
a fundamental role in this section. More details on the Skorokhod space
can be found in [Bil99]. The functions belonging to the subspace mentioned
above are c`adl`ag on the unit interval but only allowed to jump on the set
D. We use the convenient notation D[0, 1] to denote this subspace and it is
characterized as follows

F : [0, 1] → R :

D[0, 1] ≡

F is continuous in [0, 1] \ D and ∀t ∈ D

the left limit lims↑t F (s) exists;
the right limit lims↓t F (s) = F (t).

 .

We want to relate this space to C(Ω) and to this end we introduce the
following linear operator Θ : D[0, 1] → C(Ω) which sends a function F ∈
D[0, 1] to a function f ∈ C(Ω) whose its deﬁnition is

• f (x) = F (t(x)) if x /∈ t−1(D) and
• if x ∈ t−1(D) then there exists a unique y ∈ Ω \ {x} such that
If x ≺Lex y we put f (x) = lims↑t(x) F (s) and f (y) =

t(x) = t(y).
lims↓t(y) F (s) = F (t(y)).

The linearity of Θ is obvious, but the statement Θ(F ) ∈ C(Ω) whenever
F ∈ D[0, 1] requires a proof and this is the content of the next proposition.

8

Proposition 2. For every F ∈ D[0, 1] we have that Θ(F ) ∈ C(Ω).
Proof. Let x ∈ Ω be an arbitrary point and F ∈ D[0, 1]. In order to prove
the continuity of Θ(F ) at x we split the analysis in two cases: whether F is
continuous or not in t(x). Suppose that F is continuous in t(x). In this case
independently whether t(x) belongs or not to D we have Θ(F )(x) = F (t(x)).
Given ε > 0 follows from the continuity of F that there is δ > 0 such that
if |s − t(x)| < δ then |F (s) − F (t(x))| < ε. From the continuity of t it
is possible to ﬁnd η > 0 such that if d(y, x) < η then |t(x) − t(y)| < δ.
Suppose by contradiction that Θ(F ) is not continuous at x. So there is a
sequence yn ∈ Ω such that yn → x but |Θ(F )(yn) − Θ(F )(x)| = |Θ(F )(yn) −
F (t(x))| ≥ ε for all n ∈ N. Because of the previous observations for n
large enough Θ(F )(yn) (cid:54)= F (t(yn)) otherwise we reach a contradiction. So
the only possibility is Θ(F )(yn) = lims↑t(yn) F (s) for all n ≥ n0. Again, we
reach a contradiction since for large enough n we have t(yn) close to t(x)
and therefore by taking s close enough to t(x) we have F (s) close to F (t(x))
which is a contradiction with |Θ(F )(yn) − F (t(x))| ≥ ε.
Now we assume that F has a jump at t(x). In this case by the deﬁnition
of D[0, 1] there exist exactly one point y ∈ Ω \ {x} such that t(x) = t(y).
We give the argument for x ≺Lex y on the other case the analysis is similar.
Note that

y = (x1, . . . , xn, 1, 0, 0, . . .)
x = (x1, . . . , xn, 0, 1, 1, . . .).

From the deﬁnition we have

Θ(F )(x) = lim
s↑t(x)

F (s).

Given ε > 0 there is δ > 0 such that for all s satisfying t(x)− δ < s ≤ t(x) we
have |F (s)−Θ(F )(x)| < ε. Note that for every z ∈ Ω such that d(z, x) ≤ 2n+1
we have t(z) ≤ t(x). By taking z close enough to x and proceed similarly to
the previous case one can show that Θ(F )(z) is close to Θ(F )(x), thus proving
the continuity of Θ(F ) at x. Since x is arbitrary the proof is complete.

Theorem 2. The operator Θ is a Banach isomorphism (linear isometry)
between the Banach spaces (D[0, 1],(cid:107) · (cid:107)∞) and (C(Ω),(cid:107) · (cid:107)∞).
Proof. We ﬁrst construct the inverse operator Θ−1 and then we proceed to
show that Θ is an isometry.
If s ∈ [0, 1] \ D
If s ∈ D then t−1(s) = {x, y} with x (cid:54)= y.
we deﬁne F (s) = f (t−1(s)).
If x ≺Lex y we put F (s) = f (y). We claim that F ∈ D[0, 1].
Indeed, if
s ∈ [0, 1]\ D, then s has a unique binary expansion t−1(s) = (x1, . . . , xn, . . .).

Let f ∈ C(Ω) be an arbitrary continuous function.

n’s. Given ε > 0 there is δ > 0 such that
for all y ∈ Ω satisfying d(t−1(s), y) < δ we have |f (t−1(s)) − f (y)| < ε.
As mentioned before we can choose n as large as we please so that s ∈ I j
n,
for some j = 1, . . . , 2n. From the deﬁnition of I j
n the ﬁrst n terms of the
binary expansion of any r ∈ I j
n coincides with x1, . . . , xn. For n such that
2−n < δ we have d(t−1(s), t−1(r)) < δ and therefore for all r ∈ I j
n we have
|F (r) − F (s)| ≤ maxz∈t−1(r) |f (z) − f (x)| < ε.
Suppose that t(x) ∈ D and {x, y} = t−1(x). Without loss of generality
we can assume that x ≺Lex y. For n ≥ n0 we have t(x) ∈ ∂I j
for
a unique value of j ∈ {1, . . . , 2n}. Every element in t−1(I j
n) has its ﬁrst n
digits in the binary expansion equals to x1, x2, . . . , xn. Therefore some small
n∪{t(x)}. From the continuity of f at x it
neighborhood of x is sent by t in I j
follows that the small neighborhood deﬁned above is sent in a ε neighborhood
of f (x) which proves the existence of the left limit of F at t(x). The right
continuity of F at t(x) ∈ D is proved in similar way.

if t−1(s) = {x, y} and x ≺Lex y.

is a left inverse of Θ. Of course, Θ is right inverse of this operator so Θ is a
bijection.

Remains to prove that Θ is an isometry. From its very deﬁnition we have

(cid:107)Θ(F )(cid:107)∞ = sup
s∈[0,1]

|Θ(F )(s)| ≤ (cid:107)F(cid:107)∞.

If the supremum above is attained at certain point s ∈ [0, 1] \ D, take x ∈ Ω
such that t(x), then we have (cid:107)F(cid:107)∞ = |F (s)| = |Θ(F )(x)| ≤ (cid:107)Θ(F )(cid:107)∞. If
the supremum is not attained for some s ∈ D the conclusion is analogous,
otherwise (cid:107)F(cid:107)∞ = limn→∞ limr↑sn |F (r)| = limn→∞ |Θ(F )(xn)|, where xn is
the smallest point, with respect to the lexicographic order, in t−1(sn) and
the proposition follows.

Remark 1 (Wiener Spaces). Recall that the classical Wiener space on the
closed unit interval [0, 1], notation W [0, 1], is the set of all real continuous

10

functions F : [0, 1] → R such that F (0) = 0. Consider the closed subspace of
C(Ω) given by

W (Ω) ≡ {f ∈ C(Ω) : f (0∞) = 0, f (x) = f (y) whenever t(x) = t(y)},

where the mapping t : Ω → R was previously deﬁned. It is easy to see that
for every F ∈ W [0, 1] its composition with t give us a mapping F ◦ t ∈ W (Ω).
Moreover the linear mapping F (cid:55)→ F ◦t is an isometry from W [0, 1] to W (Ω).

4 Stochastic Functional Equation for λBλBλB

In this section we apply the results above obtained. The idea is to obtain a
stochastic functional equation using the operator Θ and Theorem 1 to give a
semi-explicit representation of the main eigenvalue λB of the random Ruelle
operator LBt(·).
Since hB is a continuous function almost surely, we can associate to it a
c`adl`ag process {Xs : 0 ≤ s ≤ 1} so that Θ(X(·)) = hB. By simple algebraic
manipulation we can see that t(0x) = t(x)/2 and t(1x) = 1/2 + t(x)/2. By
applying the inverse of the operator Θ on both sides of the (1) we get the

5 The Computation of λBλBλB

In the deterministic case, when the potential is assumed to have H¨older,
Walters or Bowen regularity, it is easy to obtain lower and upper bounds of
the main eigenvalue of the Ruelle operator by using the supremum norm of
the potential. We recall that when the potential have such regularity the
main eigenvalue do exists and is actually equals to the spectral radius.

In contrast to the deterministic case the supremum norm of the poten-
tial Bt(·) by itself does not help in ﬁnding bounds to the spectral radius.
The reason is sup{|Bt(x)| : x ∈ Ω} is an unbounded random variable. The
representation of λB obtained in the last section is not also suitable to take
expectations and very hard to bound due its combinatorial nature. Therefore
a diﬀerent approach is needed to bound the main eigenvalue of the random
Ruelle operator. To obtain the lower and upper bounds and actually the
exact value of λB we use an intricate combination of the Birkhoﬀ Ergodic
Theorem, Strong Law of Large Numbers and some fundamental properties
of the Brownian motion.

Theorem 3. If λB denotes the main eigenvalue of the random Ruelle oper-
ator LBt(·). Then λB = 2 almost surely with respect to the Wiener Measure.

Proof. The argument for the lower bound as mentioned above is based on
the Birkhoﬀ Ergodic Theorem, Strong Law of Large Numbers and some
elementary facts about the Brownian motion. To lighten notation for any
real function f we write Snf = f + f ◦ σ + . . . + f ◦ σn−1.

independence and stationarity of the increments of the Brownian motion

If

nian motion and for any a1, . . . , an ∈ {0, 1}, we can ﬁnd x(a1, . . . , an) ∈ Ω
(depending on the realization of the Brownian motion) such that for every
element y ∈ {(a1, . . . , an, x(a1, . . . , an)) ∈ Ω : a1, . . . , an ∈ {0, 1}n}, we have

Now, we want to prove that λB ≤ 2 a.s.. This proof is similar to the

Ergodic Theorem that σ−1(A) = A and ν(A) = 1. As ν is σ-invariant we

surely with respect to the Wiener Measure. Thus, concluding the proof.

6 Annealed and Quenched Pressure
By using the γ-H¨older regularity of the Brownian potential x (cid:55)→ Bt(x) and a
classical result of Thermodynamic formalism, we have almost certain

(cid:27)

where P (·) is the topological pressure, Pσ(Ω) is the set of all Borel probabil-
ity measures that are shift invariant and h is the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.
From the previous identity and Theorem 3 it follows immediately that

P quenched(Bt(·)) = log 2.

Using once more the γ-H¨older regularity of the Brownian potential we have
almost certain that n−1 log L n

Finally, as another application of the Theorem 3 we obtain the annealed

7 Concluding Remarks

is given by (x1, x2 . . . ) (cid:55)→(cid:80)

As mentioned, all the results presented in this paper can be extended to the
space Ω = {0, . . . , m − 1}N
. For such state spaces the map t : Ω → [0, 1]
n≥1 m−nxn. Analogous arguments can be used
to prove the Proposition 1 and Theorem 1. In the Section 3, the arguments
would be completely analogous, only changing appropriately the set D.
In the Section 4, we would have a subtle change in the stochastic func-
tional equation. Now we have for every a ∈ {0, . . . , m − 1} and x ∈ Ω,
t(ax) = a/m + t(x)/m, thus a subtle change on the stochastic functional
equation appears exp(Bt/m)Xt/m + exp(B1/m+t/m)X1/m+t/m = λBXt. Thus,
by taking t = 0, we recover the representation of the main eigenvalue

By using similar arguments to those in the previous section, one has the

existence, ﬁniteness and equality of the annealed and quenched pressures.
