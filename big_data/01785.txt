ON THE CONVERGENCE OF HARMONIC RITZ VECTORS AND

HARMONIC RITZ VALUES

GANG WU∗

Abstract. We are interested in computing a simple eigenpair (λ, x) of a large non-Hermitian
matrix A, by a general harmonic Rayleigh-Ritz projection method. Given a search subspace K and a
target point τ , we focus on the convergence of the harmonic Ritz vector ex and harmonic Ritz value eλ.
In [Z. Jia, The convergence of harmonic Ritz values, harmonic Ritz vectors, and reﬁned harmonic
Ritz vectors, Math. Comput., 74 (2004), pp. 1441–1456.], Jia showed that for the convergence of
harmonic Ritz vectors and harmonic Ritz values, it is essential to assume certain Rayleigh quotient
matrix is uniformly nonsingular as ∠(x, K) → 0. However, the assumption can not be guaranteed
theoretically for a general matrix A, and the Rayleigh quotient matrix can be singular or near singular
even if τ is not close to λ. In this paper, we abolish this constraint and derive new bounds for the
convergence of harmonic Rayleigh-Ritz projection methods. We show that as the distance between x
and K tends to zero and τ is satisﬁed with the so-called uniform separation condition, the harmonic
λ−τ is well separated from other
Ritz value converges, and the harmonic Ritz vector converges as
Ritz values of (A − τ I)−1 in the orthogonal complement of (A − τ I)ex with respect to (A − τ I)K.

1. Introduction. Rayleigh-Ritz projection methods are popular techniques for
solving a few eigenpairs of an n-by-n large non-Hermitian matrix A [1, 13, 14]. Given
a search subspace K whose dimension m ≪ n, the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure seeks
Galerkin condition

an approximation (bλ,bx) to the desired eigenpair (λ, x), which satisﬁes the following

(cid:26)

bx ∈ K
Abx −bλbx ⊥ K.
m AVmp = bλp. Then bλ is called a Ritz value

(1.1)

Let Vm be an orthonormal basis of K, then (1.1) reduces to solving an eigenproblem
with respect to an m-by-m matrix: V H

andbx = Vmp is called a Ritz vector of A in the subspace K.

It is well known that Rayleigh-Ritz projection methods are suitable for solving ex-
terior eigenpairs [10, 12], however, if some interior eigenpairs are desired, the harmonic
Rayleigh-Ritz projection methods are more appropriate [1, 10, 11, 12, 14]. Suppose
that we want to compute some eigenvalues near a target point τ ∈ C. Then these
possible interior eigenvalues of A can be transformed into some exterior eigenvalues of
the matrix (A− τ I)−1, and some standard Rayleigh-Ritz projection methods working
on (A − τ I)−1 can be utilized. However, factoring A− τ I is often very expensive and
even impractical. The harmonic Rayleigh-Ritz projection method is primarily used
to settle this problem and to compute interior eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large
matrices without factoring A − τ I [4, 10, 11, 12].

More precisely, the harmonic Rayleigh-Ritz procedure seeks a harmonic Ritz pair

the other harmonic Ritz values, see also [2]. However, for a non-Hermitian matrix
A, the assumption of the Rayleigh quotient matrix is uniformly nonsingular can not
be guaranteed theoretically [6, Theorem 4.3]. Further, the Rayleigh quotient matrix
can be singular or near singular even if τ is not close to λ, and the upper bounds
given in [6] can be overestimated when the Rayleigh quotient matrix is near singular.
We construct an example to illustrate this phenomenon. Therefore, it is necessary to
revisit the convergence of harmonic Ritz vectors and harmonic Ritz values.

the closeness of the harmonic Ritz pair (eλ,ex) to the exact eigenpair (λ, x), generally

Very recently, Vecharynski [16] presented a Saad’s type bound for harmonic Ritz
vectors of a Hermitian matrix A. It shows that, along with ∠(x,K), the closeness of
the harmonic Ritz vectors to the exact eigenvectors generally depends on the spectral
condition number of A − τ I.
In this paper, we abolish the constraint of uniform
non-singularity of the Rayleigh quotient matrix that required in [2, 6], and generalize
the main result of [16] to the non-Hermitian case. We prove that as ∠(x,K) → 0,
depends on the condition number of the shifted matrix A − τ I, which is uniformly
bounded as τ 6= λ. More precisely, we show that the convergence of the harmonic Ritz
vector is closely related to the condition number κ(A − τ I), while the convergence
of the harmonic Ritz value generally depends on the ratio κ(A − τ I)/|τ − λ|. Note
that the assumption of ∠(x,K) → 0 is not stringent in practice.
Indeed, it is a
necessary condition for any approximate eigenvectors in K to converge. Otherwise,
all the approximate eigenvectors in K will not converge [6, 7, 8].
Throughout this paper, we make the assumption that λ 6= τ and A − τ I is
nonsingular, moreover, we assume that λ is the closet eigenvalue to τ , i.e.,

|λ − τ| = min

λi∈Λ(A)|λi − τ|,

where Λ(A) = {λ1, λ2, . . . , λn} is the spectrum of A. The eigenvector and the ap-
proximate eigenvectors are normalized to have unit length. The norm k · k used is

the Euclidean norm (or the 2-norm) of a vector or matrix, and ∠(x, y) represents the
acute angle between the two vectors x and y. The angle between a vector x and a
subspace K is deﬁned as ∠(x,K) = minw∈K,w6=0 ∠(x, w), and the sine of the angle
between a vector x and a subspace K is deﬁned as [14, pp.250]

sin ∠(x,K) = min

y∈K kx − yk.

Hence, for an unit vector x and an arbitrary y ∈ Cn, we have

sin ∠(x, y) = min

α∈C kx − αyk.

Denote by the superscript “H” the conjugate transpose of a matrix or vector. Let
κ(A) = σmax(A)/σmin(A) the condition number of A, where σmin(A) and σmax(A)
stand for the smallest and the largest singular value of A, respectively.

2. Some related work. There are a lot of convergence results available on
standard Rayleigh-Ritz projection methods; see [7, 8, 9, 13, 14] and the references
therein. In [15], a general a prior bound that describes the approximation quality
of Ritz vectors for non-Hermitian matrices was given by Stewart, which is a gener-
alization of “Saad’s bound” [13, Theorem 4.6] for Hermitian matrices. We call it
“Stewart’s bound” on Ritz vectors of general matrices.

vectors.
Theorem 2.3. [6, Theorem 3.2] Let ǫ = sin ∠(x,K), assume that B is nonsin-

In particular, we have the following corollary. It indicates that the convergence of

harmonic Ritz vectors is closely related to the condition number κ(A)(cid:0)or κ(A − τ I)
if τ 6= 0(cid:1) when A(cid:0)or A − τ I(cid:1) is Hermitian positive or Hermitian negative.

Corollary 2.1. Let ǫ = sin ∠(x,K) and τ = 0. Assume that A is Hermitian

harmonic Ritz values.

A combination of the following two theorems sheds light on the convergence of

Theorem 2.4.

[6, Theorem 2.1] Let B−1C be the harmonic Rayleigh quotient
matrix, let (λ, x) be the desired eigenpair of A with kxk = 1 and let ǫ = sin ∠(x,K),
τ = 0. Then there is a matrix E satisfying

and such that λ is an eigenvaule of B−1C + E.

|λ − µ| ≤ (2kAk + kEk)1− 1

(2.5)

where m is the order of B−1C.

All the results given in Theorems 2.2–2.5 require that kB−1k is uniformly bounded
(or B is uniformly nonsingular) as sin ∠(x,K) → 0, which can not be guaranteed
theoretically [6, Theorem 4.3]. For instance, for interior eigenvalues of an indeﬁnite
(shifted) A, this condition might never be satisﬁed [17, pp.104].
In practice, the
matrix B can be singular or near singular. Even if B is not singular exactly, near
singular is bad enough [6]. Recently, Vecharynski established a Saad’s type bound for
harmonic Ritz vectors of a Hermitian matrix [16]. The bound shows a dependence of
the harmonic Rayleigh-Ritz procedure on the spectral condition number of A − τ I.
Let’s discuss it in more detail. First, a two-sided bound on sin ∠(x, Ay) in terms
of sin ∠(x, y) was investigated when A is Hermitian, where y ∈ Cn is an arbitrary
vector. It is crucial for deriving the main result of [16, pp.4].
Theorem 2.6. [16, Lemma 1] Let (λ, x) be an eigenpair of a nonsingular Her-

mitian matrix A. Then for any vector y, we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(2.6)

where λmin and λmax are the smallest and largest magnitude eigenvalues of A.

Second, the main result of [16] was established. It shows that the approximation
quality of the harmonic Rayleigh-Ritz procedure can be hindered by a poor condi-
tioning of A − τ I. For instance, this can happen if the shift τ is chosen to be very
close to an eigenvalue of A.
Theorem 2.7. [16, Theorem 3] Let (λ, x) be an eigenpair of a Hermitian matrix

A and (eλ,ex) be a harmonic Ritz pair with respect to the subspace K and shift τ /∈

Λ(A) = {λ1, λ2, . . . , λn}. Assume that Θ is a set of all the harmonic Ritz values and
let PQ be an orthogonal projector onto (A − τ I)K. Then

In this work, we abolish the constraint of uniform non-singularity of B that re-
quired in Theorem 2.2–Theorem 2.5, and generalize Theorem 2.7 to non-Hermitian
matrices. New bounds for the convergence of harmonic Ritz vectors and harmonic
Ritz values are derived, which shows that the convergence of harmonic Ritz vectors is
closely related to the condition number κ(A− τ I), while the convergence of harmonic
Ritz values generally depends on the ratio κ(A − τ I)/|τ − λ|.

3. An extension of Stewart’s bound on harmonic Ritz vectors. In this
section, we take into account the convergence of harmonic Ritz vectors as the distance
between x and K approaches zero. We ﬁrst present the following theorem that is a
generalization of Theorem 2.6 to non-Hermitian matrices. Note that the proof is much
simpler than that of Theorem 2.6; see [16, pp.4–pp.6].

Theorem 3.1. Let (λ, x) be an eigenpair of A, and suppose that τ 6= λ. Then

for any vector y ∈ Cn, we have

σmin(A − τ I)

Proof. On one hand, we have from (1.4) that

sin ∠(x, y) ≤ sin ∠(cid:0)x, (A − τ I)y(cid:1) ≤
sin ∠(cid:0)x, (A − τ I)y(cid:1) = sin ∠(cid:0)(A − τ I)x/(λ − τ ), (A − τ I)y(cid:1)

In other words, (3.4) can be understood as an orthogonal projection process for (A −

vector of A in the subspace K are given byeλ andex = Vmq, respectively.
Let bU be an orthonormal matrix whose columns span the orthogonal complement
of (A−τ I)ex with respect to (A−τ I)K, and let bG = bU H(A−τ I)−1bU . As(cid:0)1/(λ−τ ), x(cid:1)
is an eigenpair of (A − τ I)−1, if sep(cid:0)1/(λ − τ ), bG(cid:1) > 0, then it follows from Theorem
sin ∠(cid:0)x, (A − τ I)ex(cid:1) ≤ sin ∠(cid:0)x, (A − τ I)K(cid:1)s1 +
wherebγ = kPQ(A − τ I)−1(I − PQ)k with PQ being the orthogonal projector on the

Proof. Since A− τ I is nonsingular and ∠(x,by) = ∠(x,K), we have from Theorem

Furthermore, we obtain from Theorem 3.1 that

sin ∠(x, (A − τ I)ex) ≥

σmin(A − τ I)

|λ − τ|

sin ∠(x,ex).

Combining (3.6)–(3.8), we get the following result on the convergence of harmonic
Ritz vectors. It can be viewed as an extension of Stewart’s bound on harmonic Ritz
vectors, or a generalization of Theorem 2.7 to non-Hermitian matrices.

Theorem 3.2. Under the above notations, there holds

(3.9)

sin ∠(x,ex) ≤ κ(A − τ I)s1 +

Remark 3.1. Under the condition that 1/(λ − τ ) is well separated from the

eigenvalues of bG, Theorem 3.2 shows that the harmonic Ritz vector converges as

∠(x,K) → 0 and τ is not very close to λ. By “τ is not very close to λ”, we mean

Or equivalently,

κ(A − τ I) sin ∠(x,K) ≪ 1.

σmin(A − τ I) ≫ kA − τ Ik sin ∠(x,K).

(3.10)

(3.11)

We refer to (3.11) as the “uniform separation condition” of τ with respect to λ. As
a comparison, under the condition that ∠(x,K) → 0 and λ is well separated from the
eigenvalues of G1, both Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 require that kB−1k is uniformly
bounded, which might not be satisﬁed. Further, the matrix B can be singular or near
singular even if τ is not close to λ, as the following example illustrates.

Example 1. Consider the matrix

whose eigenvalues are {2,−2, 9}. We want to compute the eigenvalue λ = 2 and the
associated eigenvector x = [1, 0, 0]H. If we choose τ = 1 and let

The matrix pencil (C, B) has two eigenvalues: 1 and -Inf, i.e., the matrix pencil has an
inﬁnite eigenvalue. Notice that C is Hermitian positive deﬁnite, and thus the matrix
pencil in (1.3) is always regular [5]. Therefore, all the results given in Theorem 2.2–
Theorem 2.5 do not work. However, we ﬁnd that κ(A − τ I) = 10.006189420283654,
Indeed, the harmonic Ritz vector is
implying that A − τ I is perfectly conditioned.

ex = [1, 0, 0]H and the harmonic Ritz value is eλ = 2, both are exact solutions.

Of cause, in practice it is rare that x ∈ K and B is singular exactly. But a nearly
singular B is bad enough. We next perturb Vm by setting the (3, 1) element of Vm to

Theorem 3.2 indicates that the convergence of harmonic Ritz vector generally
depends on the condition number of the shifted matrix A − τ I, so there is a trade-oﬀ
between choosing the target point τ very close to and choosing it far away from λ
in harmonic projection methods. Furthermore, let X be an eigenspace (or invariant

subspace) of A, and let eX be a harmonic Ritz subspace in K of the same dimension
as X , Theorem 3.2 can be extended to relating sin ∠(X , eX ) and sin ∠(X ,K), with

κ(A − τ I) being a key factor in the relationship.

4. On the convergence of harmonic Ritz values. In [6], Jia analyzed the
convergence of the harmonic Ritz value, and concluded that it converges as ∠(x,K) →
0 and B is uniformly nonsingular. However, as Example 1 illustrates, the uniform
non-singularity of B cannot be guaranteed theoretically, and B can be singular or near
singular even if τ is not close to λ at all. As a result, it is interesting to establish new
theoretical bounds on the convergence of harmonic Ritz values. In [6, Theorem 4.1],
better error bounds were derived, under the condition that the harmonic Ritz vector

ex converges and |λ − τ| ≫ sin ∠(x,K); and it was demonstrated that the harmonic
projection method can miss the eigenvalue λ if it is very close to τ . In this section,
we revisit the convergence of the harmonic Ritz value, and show that it converges as
sin ∠(x,K) → 0 and the uniform separation condition (3.11) is satisﬁed, with no need
to make the assumption that that ex → x. It is crucial to keep in mind that our new
bounds do not require the evaluation of (A − τ I)−1 and are computable by using A
only.
In this section, we assume thateλ is not an inﬁnite eigenvalue of the matrix pencil

harmonic Ritz values have an application in the computation of eigenvalues in the
interior of the spectrum of a large sparse matrix [17, 18]. In [17], V¨oemel investigated
harmonic Ritz values of a symmetric matrix A from a slightly diﬀerent perspective,
and considered a bounded functional that yields the reciprocals of the harmonic Ritz
values.

By [7, Theorem 2.1], there is a matrix F satisfying

kFk ≤

λ−τ is an eigenvalue of D + F . However, the upper bound established in
such that
Corollary 3.1 cannot be applied to (4.2) directly, since for a small but ﬁxed sin ∠(x,K),
the righthand side of (3.7) can be much larger than 1 if σmax(A− τ I) ≫ |λ− τ|. Thus,

we need to seek a new upper found for sin ∠(cid:0)x, (A − τ I)K(cid:1) in terms of sin ∠(x,K).
Let bX ∈ Cn×(n−1) be an orthonormal basis for the orthogonal complement of the

that is, both η1 and η2 are uniformly bounded. Combining (4.6)–(4.9), we obtain the

We point out that the results still hold when x and y are collinear, where z = 0 and

We are now in a position to consider the convergence of harmonic Ritz values.
The proof is along the line of [7]: First, we will show that if ∠(x,K) is small then 1
eλ−τ
is an eigenvalue of a matrix D + F that is near D. Second, we make use of Elsner’s
theorem [3] to show that D must have an eigenvalue that are near that of (A− τ I)−1.
We ﬁrst have the following theorem.
Theorem 4.2. Under the above notations, if |λ−τ| 6= tan ∠(x,K)·cos ∠(w,bz)kwk,

then there is a matrix F satisfying

kFk ≤

Remark 4.2. By (4.10), cos ∠(w,bz)kwk is uniformly bounded. Consequently,
the condition |λ − τ| 6= tan ∠(x,K) · cos ∠(w,bz)kwk is not stringent as the uniform
that cos ∠(w,bz)kwk ≪ |λ − τ| cot ∠(x,K), we have from (4.15) that

separation condition (3.11) is satisﬁed and ∠(x,K) → 0. Indeed, as ∠(x,K) → 0 such

In other words, the norm of F will be uniformly bounded and tend to zero as ∠(x,K) →
0 and the uniform separation condition (3.11) is satisﬁed. On the other hand, if |λ−τ|
is very small, say, in the order of tan ∠(x,K), then κ(A − τ I)/|λ − τ| may be very
large, so that kFk is not necessarily small for a very small but ﬁxed ∠(x,K).
Remark 4.3. Theorem 4.2 shows that the norm of the perturbation matrix F is
related to κ(A−τ I)
. Recall from Theorem 3.2 that the convergence of harmonic Ritz
|λ−τ |
vectors generally depends on κ(A − τ I). Thus, (4.17) explains why the harmonic
Ritz value may converge slower than the harmonic Ritz vector in some cases; see [6,
Example 1].

We will present the following corollary on the convergence of harmonic Ritz values.

Here we make use of Elsner’s theorem [3] which says that, given matrices A and eA of
order n, for any eigenvalue λ of A, there is an eigenvalue ν of eA satisfying
Corollary 4.3. Suppose that λ 6= τ and eλ is not an inﬁnite eigenvalue of
the matrix pencil (C, B). If |λ − τ| 6= tan ∠(x,K) · cos ∠(w,bz)kwk, then there is an

n kA − eAk

of D such that

where m is the order of D.

Proof. The result is from applying Elsner’s theorem to D and D + F , as well as

the fact that kDk ≤ k(A − τ I)−1k = κ(A − τ I)/kA − τ Ik.

Remark 4.4. Although (4.19) is a gross overestimate in general, it indicates

that eλ converges to λ if ∠(x,K) → 0 and τ is satisﬁed with the uniform separation

condition (3.11). On the other hand, if τ is very close to λ, then the factor κ(A−τ I)
|λ−τ |
can be very large, and Theorem 4.2 and Corollary 4.3 demonstrate that the harmonic
projection method will produce a spurious or insigniﬁcant harmonic Ritz value.

Further, recall that the harmonic Ritz values of A with respect to K are the recip-
rocals of the Ritz values of (A − τ I)−1 with respect to (A − τ I)K. If A − τ I has an
eigenvalue very close to zero, the subspace (A− τ I)K is almost deﬁcient in the eigen-
vector x associated with λ − τ , even though sin ∠(x,K) approaches zero. In view of
the convergence theory for the standard projection methods [7, 8, 9], it is known that
generally there is no Ritz value of (A− τ I)−1 with respect to (A− τ I)K that converges
to 1/(λ − τ ), i.e., there is in general no harmonic Ritz value of A with respect to K
that converges to λ. In [6, pp.1452], Jia explained this qualitatively, while Theorem
4.2 and Corollary 4.3 show this more precisely from a theoretical point of view.

Finally, it was pointed out that the reﬁned harmonic Ritz vector and the har-
monic Ritz value share the same suﬃcient condition for convergence [6, pp.1453], i.e.,
both require that kB−1k is uniformly bounded or B is uniformly nonsingular. From
Theorem 4.2, Corollary 4.3, and Theorem 5.1 of [6], we conclude that the reﬁned
harmonic Ritz vector converges as the distance between x and K tends to zero and τ
is satisﬁed with the uniform separation condition.
