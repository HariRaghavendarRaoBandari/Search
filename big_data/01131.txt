Stimulated by the recent observation of the X(5568), we study the X(5568) and its partners under the
tetraquark scenario. In the framework of the color-magnetic interaction, we estimate the masses of the part-
ner states of the X(5568) and discuss their decay pattern, which provide valuable information on the future
experimental search of these states.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Very recently, the DØ Collaboration observed a narrow
structure by analyzing the B0
sπ± invariant mass spectrum,
which was named as the X(5568) [1]. The X(5568) has a
mass m = 5567.8 ± 2.9(stat)+0.9
−1.9(syst) MeV and width Γ =
21.9 ± 6.4(stat)+5.0
−2.5(syst) MeV [1]. Its discovery mode indi-
cates that the valence quark component of the X(5568) should
be ℓs¯ℓ¯b (ℓ = u or d). Thus, the X(5568) is a good candidate of
the exotic tetraquark state. In the past decades, experimental
search for the exotic states and the corresponding theoretical
investigations have been an important research topic of hadron
physic (see recent review on the study of the exotic states in
Ref. [2]).

Under the general tetraquark scheme, there exist two pos-
sible conﬁgurations for the X(5568), i.e., the ¯BK molecular
state and a compact tetraquark composed of a diquark and
[3], Liu et al. studied the ¯BK inter-
anti-diquark. In Ref.
action in the framework of chiral perturbative theory. The
authors found that the Weinberg-Tomozawa term for the ¯BK
interaction in the isovector sector is zero [3], which shows
that the attraction between ¯B and K is not strong. If assigning
the X(5568) as the ¯BK molecular state, the binding energy of
the ¯BK system should be around 200 MeV. In other words,
this ¯BK molecular state is a deeply bound state. It is obvious
that the study from Ref. [3] does not support such a deeply
bound ¯BK molecular state scenario. We also notice a dynam-
ical study of the interaction between ¯B and K by exchanging
the ρ and ω mesons [4]. They did not ﬁnd a bound state solu-
tion for the S-wave ¯BK system [4].

The observation of X(5568) has inspired extensive discus-

sions of the possibility of a compact tetraquark state. Chen et
al. [5] constructed 0+ and 1+ tetraquark current, and adopted
the QCD sum rule approach to calculate the corresponding
masses. Their result supports the X(5568) as tetraquark state
with spin-parity quantum number JP = 0+ or 1+. Addition-
ally, the charmed partner of the X(5568) was predicted [5]. In
Ref. [5], the authors considered the X(5568) as a tetraquark
state with JP = 0+ and calculated its mass [6] and decay width
[7]. Zanetti, Nielsen and Khemchandani also adopted the
QCD sum rule formalism to study the X(5568) as a tetraquark
state with JP = 0+ [8]. A similar QCD sum rule study was
performed in Ref. [9]. Wang and Zhu applied the eﬀective
Hamiltonian approach to calculate the mass spectrum of the
tetraquark state [10]. They found that a S-wave tetraquark
with the quark component [su][¯b ¯d] and JP = 0+ lies 150
MeV higher than the X(5568). There also exists the discus-
sion of the X(5568) → Bsπ+ and X(5616) → B∗sπ+ decay [11],
where X(5568) and X(5616) was assumed as the S-wave B ¯K
and B ¯K∗ molecular states, respectively. In Ref. [12], Liu and
Li explained the X(5568) to be the near threshold rescattering
eﬀect.

Twelve years ago, in order to explain its exotic decay
modes, Liu et al. once proposed a tetraquark structure for
the DsJ(2632) signal observed by the SELEX collaboration
[13]. The X(5568) corresponds to the bottom partner of the
Ds,¯6 or Ds,15 state there. The discovery of the X(5568) signal
aroused our interest in the tetraquark candidates with four dif-
ferent ﬂavors again. If the X(5568) is a tetraquark state, its
partner states within the same multiplet must also exist. In
this work, we mainly focus on the partner states of X(5568)
under the tetraquark scenario. We will estimate the mass dif-
ference of these partner states based on the color-magnetic in-
teraction. Thus, the present study hopefully provides valuable
information on these partners of the X(5568). Experimental
search for them can further test the tetraquark assignment to
the X(5568).

This paper is organized as follows. After the introduction,

we present the detailed formalism in Sec. II. In Sec. III, we
present the numerical results of the teatrquark spectrum. In
Sec. IV, we discuss their strong decay patterns . The paper
ends with a short discussion in Sec. V.

II. FRAMEWORK

The low mass of X(5568) suggests the existence of the
tightly bound four quark states in the presence of the heavy
quark, which may help stablize the tetraquark system. For
such compact systems conﬁned within one MIT bag, the short
range interaction should be important. Here we adopt a sim-
ple chromomagnetic interaction model containing the contact
interaction only. The model Hamiltonian reads [14]

H = H0 + HCMI

= Xi

mi +Xi< j

Ci j

mim j  −

3

32! λi · λ jσi · σ j,

(1)

where λ (σ) is the generator for the color (spin) symmetry and
C′s are the parameters to be determined with known hadrons.
In order to calculate the color-spin matrix elements, we ex-
plicitly construct the f lavor ⊗ color ⊗ spin wave functions for
the tetraquark system qq ¯q¯b. In discussing of the DsJ(2632),
we have obtained the ﬂavor wave functions in [13]. Here, we
only need to extend formalism in [13] and include the spin
degree of freedom. We mainly focus on the bottom mesons.

In the systems with one heavy quark, there exist degen-
erate spin doublets in the heavy quark limit. The properties
of the tetraquark state is dominantly determined by the light
quark cluster qq ¯q. The ﬂavor-color-spin wave functions of
two quarks is constrained by the Pauli principle. Therefore we
mainly consider the light diquark and do not assume any struc-
ture for the two antiquark ¯q ¯Q. In other words, the tetraquark
system is treated as a triquark plus a heavy antiquark.

According to the diquark classiﬁcation, we consider four

cases for the tetraquark structure qq ¯q ¯Q in the present study:
(1) The representations for the qq diquark are ¯3 f , ¯3c and
thus S qq = 0, S qq ¯q = 1/2. The ﬁnal tetraquark states form
two ﬂavor multiplets 3 f and ¯6 f . In spin space, a degenerate
(0+, 1+) doublet exists in the heavy quark limit. In this case
the diquark is a “good” diquark.

(2) The representations for the qq diquark are ¯3 f , 6c and
thus S qq = 1, S qq ¯q = 3/2 or 1/2. The ﬁnal ﬂavor multiplets
are 3 f and ¯6 f . Now in spin space, there are two degenerate
doublets (1+, 2+) and (0+, 1+). The color-spin interaction for
the two light quarks is weaker than the case (1) but is still
attractive. One can see this from the calculated values below.
(3) The representation for the qq diquark are 6 f , ¯3c and thus
S qq = 1, S qq ¯q = 3/2 or 1/2. The ﬁnal ﬂavor multiplets are
3 f and 15 f . The spin doublets are the same as the case (2).
The color-spin interaction for the two light quarks is weakly
repulsive.

(4) The representation for the qq diquark are 6 f , 6c and thus
S qq = 0, S qq ¯q = 1/2. The ﬁnal ﬂavor multiplets are 3 f and
15 f . There is one spin doublet (0+, 1+). The color-spin inter-
action for the two light quarks is repulsive.

2

For the explicit ﬂavor wave functions, one may consult Ref.
[13]. The color wave functions for qq ¯q are easily obtained
with the replacement u → r, d → g, and s → b. The ﬁnal
color wave function for the tetraquark state depends on the
color state of qq. In the cases (1) and (3), it reads

1
2 √3

[(rb¯b − br¯b − gr ¯g + rg¯g)¯r + (gb¯b − bg¯b + gr¯r − rg¯r)¯g
−(gb¯g − bg¯g + rb¯r − br¯r)¯b].
(2)

In the cases (2) and (4), one gets

1
2 √6

[(rb¯b + br¯b + gr ¯g + rg¯g + 2rr¯r)¯r + (gb¯b + bg¯b + gr¯r

+rg¯r + 2gg¯g)¯g + (gb¯g + bg¯g + rb¯r + br¯r + 2bb¯b)¯b]. (3)

These wave functions are constructed with the S U(3) C.G.
coeﬃcients given in Refs. [15, 16]. The spin wave functions
are easy to get and we do not show them explicitly.

The S U(3) ﬂavor symmetry is actually violated by the un-
equal quark mass. Such a breaking eﬀect might be large in the
multiquark systems. As a result, there may exist the mixing
between the states with the same quantum numbers. In this
work, we consider the “ideal” mixing. In the cases (1) and
(2), the isospin one-half states in ¯6 f and 3 f mix and one gets
the following states

In the cases (3) and (4), the mixed isospin-half states are

We adopt the notations in Ref. [13] for the other tetraquarks
and summarize them in Table I. With the explicit expressions
for the generators λ and σ and the constructed wave functions,
one can calculate the matrix element CMI = hHCMIi.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We present the calculated CMI’s in Tables II-V, where a
multiplicative factor − 3
32 is implicitly assumed. The mass be-
low the state symbol in the ﬁrst column in Tables II-V is sim-
ply the sum of the mass of the four quark without the chromo-
magnetic interaction. In order to estimate the rough masses
of the tetraquark states, one has to determine the ten parame-
ters in HCMI . To do that, we calculate CMI’s for the ground

state baryons and mesons and extract the values of the ten
parameters from the mass splittings. We collect the results
in Table VI. In the extraction of the parameters of the light
quark-antiquark interaction, we don not use the masses of the
pseudoscalar mesons as input since they are inﬂuenced by the
chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking. Here we adopt
the light quark-quark CMI values: Cq ¯q
= 94

q
MeV, and Cs ¯s
= 242 MeV. The quark masses are taken from
m2
s
our previous work mq = 310 MeV, ms = 450 MeV, mc = 1430
MeV, and mb = 4630 MeV [13]. We present the estimated
tetraquark masses for the both bottom and charm cases in Ta-
bles II-V. We mainly discuss the bottom tetraquarks in the fol-
lowing. The charmed tetraquarks have very similar features.
In the case (1), one always gets hHCMIi < 0. From Table II
and the value of the parameters, we notice that the attraction
mainly arises from the color-magnetic interaction between the
light quarks. The CMI’s between quark and antiquark vanish
in the present case. Although the interaction between the anti-
quarks is repulsive (negative values in Table II) for the vector
case, the resulting total interaction is still attractive.

The state Bs,¯6 with J = 0 corresponds to the X(5568) al-
though the mass is 51 MeV higher. Considering the model er-
rors, the tetraquark interpretation for the X(5568) is favored.
If this state really exists, its tetraquark partners in Table II

3

should all exist. For example, the CMI for the Bℓ state with
J = 0 is about -160 MeV while the CMI is -80 MeV for
Bs,¯6 with J = 0. The most attractive interaction occurs for
B ¯s,¯6 (J=0) with CMI = −166 MeV. The larger CMI’s for
Bℓ and B ¯s,¯6 lies in the fact that the ℓℓ (ℓ = u or d) interac-
tion is stronger than the ℓs interaction while the interaction
for the antiquarks does not matter. We perform the calcula-
tion with ﬂavor wave functions in the SU(3) symmetry limit.
Since there does not exist a symmetry violating operator in
the Hamiltonian, we get a degenerate result for Bs,¯6 and Bs,3.
One expects a lower Bs,3 tetraquark state once a more realistic
model is adopted.

In the case (2),

the color-magnetic interaction for the
(0+, 1+) doublet is always attractive. Although the quark-
quark interaction is not so attractive, the nonvanishing q ¯q in-
teraction provides much stronger attraction. As a result, the
obtained masses for the tetraquark states with S qq ¯q = 1
2 are
lower than those in the case (1). Now the Bs,¯6 state with J = 1
is close to the observed X(5568), although the mass is 49 MeV
lower. In this case, the largest CMI (-300 MeV) occurs for the
Bℓ state with J = 0, again not for Bs,¯6, which indicates the
existence of more stable non-strange tetraquark states.

From Table III, our results indicate that although a “good”
diquark is always used to discuss hadron spectrum, there may
exist a more attractive conﬁguration for the multiquark states.
More tightly bound tetraquark states are possible with a not-
so-good diquark because of the existence of a light antiquark,
which means that a triquark structure seems more appropriate
here.

In the case (3), the attractive color-magnetic interactions are
possible only for states with S qq ¯q = 1
2 . The interaction for the
light quarks is weakly repulsive but the attractive interaction
for the light quark and light antiquark may result in hHCMIi <
0. The mass of the state corresponding to the X(5568) is about
80 MeV higher than the observation.

In the case (4), one always gets a positive hHCMIi. The
color-spin interaction for the light quarks is always repulsive.
The weaker attraction between the antiquarks does not aﬀect
the ﬁnal interaction signiﬁcantly. There does not exist a good
candidate within the multiplet for the X(5568) in this case.

From the above analysis, we notice that the interaction
among the three light constituents dominantly aﬀects the chro-
momagnetic splitting and the stability of the tetraquark states.
Moreover, the state corresponding to X(5568) is not the most
tightly bound tetraquark. A better triquark assumption may be
more helpful for the stability of a multiquark system than the
“good” diquark assumption, where the triquark satisﬁes the
condition: (a) qq in 3 f , 6c, and thus S qq = 1 and (b) S qq ¯q = 1
2 .
The triquark cluster has been proposed by Karliner and Lip-
kin in discussion of the pentaquark Θ+ [18]. Here, the ﬂavor
representation of the triquark is not constrained to be ¯6 f only.

IV. DECAY PATTERNS

If the state X(5568) does exist, the tetraquark interpretation
is favored and its partners should also exist. It is worthwhile
to search for such states in various channels. Now we turn to

the decay properties of these tetraquarks. We mainly discuss
those states with hHCMIi < 0.
(a) States with quark content ℓℓ ¯s¯b (I = 1, 0): B ¯s,¯6, B ¯s,15.
The possible strong decay channel is BK. The BK threshold
is around 5774 MeV (> H0 = 5700 MeV), so the temporary
conclusion is that no strong decay channel is allowed. In the
charm case, although the D ¯s,¯6 with J = 1 in the case (2) is
above the ¯DK threshold (2365 MeV), the decay is forbidden
by angular momentum conservation.
In other words, these
tetraquark states are stable once produced.
(b) States with quark content ℓℓ ¯ℓ¯b (I = 3

2 ): Bℓ, B15, B′ℓ.
Since the Bπ threshold (5420 MeV) and the B∗π threshold
(5465 MeV) are both smaller than H0 = 5560 MeV, it is possi-
ble to ﬁnd tetraquark states in these channels. In the charmed
case, the decay into ¯Dπ (2010 MeV) or ¯D∗π (2150 MeV) is
also allowed.

(c) States with quark content ℓs ¯s¯b (I = 1

2 ): Bh, B′h. There
are two types of strong decays: Bη and BsK. The thresholds
are 5827 MeV and 5861 MeV, respectively. Only tetraquarks
with repulsive color-magnetic interaction can possibly decay.
However, in the charmed case, the tetraquark states decay into
¯Dη (2418 MeV), ¯D∗η (2558 MeV), DsK (2465 MeV), or even
D∗sK (2607 MeV). It is interesting to search for the charmed
tetraquarks in these channels.

(d) States with quark content sℓ ¯ℓ¯b (I = 1, 0): Bs,6, Bs,3,
s . The B ¯K threshold (5774 MeV) is larger than
Bs,15, B′ℓ
H0 = 5700 MeV and the lower tetraquark states can only
decay into Bsπ (5506 MeV) and B∗sπ (5555 MeV). For the
states below 5500 MeV, even the former channel is closed. Al-
though the Bs,3 tetraquark state may be above the Bsπ thresh-
old, its Bsπ decay mode is forbidden by isospin conserva-

s (2426) are all above the ¯D ¯K
Ds,3(2397), Ds,15(2426), and D′ℓ
threshold (2365 MeV) and the Dsπ threshold (2109 MeV).
The decay into these channels is allowed. The decay into
D∗sπ for the spin-1 partners of these Ds tetraquarks is also al-
lowed. It is very interesting to search for the possible charmed
tetraquarks in the isovector channels. That is, the charmed
partners of X(5568) have more decay modes. Their ratios
might be used to identify the tetraquark nature, like the un-
conﬁrmed DsJ(2632) [13].

s . The most
possible channel is Bsη whose threshold is 5914 MeV (< H0 =
5980 MeV). But, the strong decay for the obtained tetraquarks

with the attractive interaction is kinematically forbidden. In
the charmed case, however, both Dsη (2517 MeV) and D∗sη
channels are kinematically allowed.

(f) States with quark content ss¯ℓ¯b (I = 1

2 ): Bss,15. If such
tetraquarks with repulsive interaction exist, their decay into
Bs ¯K (5861 MeV) is probably kinematically allowed. Similar
observation holds for the charmed case.

Therefore, our numerical results indicate that the bottom
tetraquark states with the attractive interaction are stable. If
one wants to search for them through strong decay, the only
possible channels are Bπ, B∗π, or Bsπ. On the other hand, the
charmed tetraquarks may be searched for in the channels Dπ,
D∗π, Dsπ, D∗sπ, Dη, D∗η, Dsη, D∗sη, DK, DsK, or even D∗sK.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have discussed the possible bottom
tetraquark states with the chromomagnetic interaction model.
We have considered four kinds of tetraquark structures ac-
cording to the symmetry of the two light quarks. We ﬁnd that
the observed X(5568) can be accommodated as a tetraquark
candidate easily. Our analysis indicates that the other possible
bottom tetraquarks should also exist and should be stable.

From the numerical results, we ﬁnd that the stability of a
qq ¯q¯b tetraquark state is dominantly determined by the inter-
action among the three light constituents. A triquark structure
may result in lower tetraquark masses than a diquark assump-
tion. Such a triquark structure is similar to that proposed in
Ref. [18] but the ﬂavor representation may also be 3 f .

In the charmed case, there also exist many qq ¯q¯c tetraquark
states. They have more strong decay channels than the bot-
tom partners. In particular, the experimental search for the
charmed partners of the X(5568) are strongly called for in the
Dsπ, D∗sπ, and isovector ¯D ¯K channels.
