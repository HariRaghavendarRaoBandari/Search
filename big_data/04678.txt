THE C ∗-ALGEBRAS OF QUANTUM LENS
AND WEIGHTED PROJECTIVE SPACES

TOMASZ BRZEZI ´NSKI AND WOJCIECH SZYMA ´NSKI

Abstract. It is shown that the algebra of continuous functions on the quantum 2n+1-
dimensional lens space C(L2n+1
(N ; m0, . . . , mn)) is a graph C ∗-algebra, for arbitrary
positive weights m0, . . . , mn. The form of the corresponding graph is determined from
the skew product of the graph which deﬁnes the algebra of continuous functions on
the quantum sphere S 2n+1
and the cyclic group ZN , with the labelling induced by
the weights. Based on this description, the K-groups of speciﬁc examples are com-
puted. Furthermore, the K-groups of the algebras of continuous functions on quantum
weighted projective spaces C(WPn
q (m0, . . . , mn)), interpreted as ﬁxed points under the
circle action on C(S 2n+1

), are computed under a mild assumption on the weights.

1. Introduction

The aim of the present paper is investigation of noncommutative C ∗-algebras of con-
tinuous functions on quantum deformations of two classes of (possibly singular) spaces,
namely the lens and weighted projective spaces. Central to these studies is identiﬁcation
of the algebras in question as graph C ∗-algebras or subalgebras of graph C ∗-algebras
corresponding to certain actions of the circle group.

In classical geometry both (weighted) lens and weighted projective spaces are obtained
as quotients of groups acting (with possible diﬀerent positive integer weights) on the
odd dimensional spheres. In the former case the acting group is a ﬁnite cyclic group,
in the latter it is the circle group. Depending on the choice of weights (relatively to
the order of the acting group) the action can be free or almost free, thus leading to
most easily accessible examples of orbifolds in the latter case, [31] or [3]. The fact
that these orbifolds are deﬁned by explicit group actions on the spheres suggests an
accessible way of deﬁning and studying their noncommutative counterparts through
the exploration of analogous actions on quantum odd dimensional spheres, [27]. On this
premise, quantum lens spaces were deﬁned in [21], and more recently weighted projective
spaces were introduced in [9] with a speciﬁc aim of studying quantum or noncommutative
orbifolds, a task subsequently undertaken for example in [18], [15], [25], [19] and a series
of papers by the ﬁrst author of the present paper. Surprising results of these initial
studies include observations that, upon deformation, classically non-free actions become
free (see e.g. [10], [6] or [15]) and deformations of non-smooth objects behave as if they
were deformations of smooth objects (see e.g. [8], [12]). Despite a signiﬁcant progress
in understanding the structure of weighted projective spaces in special cases (see e.g.

[15], [10]) and deformations of classically singular lens spaces, the full picture is still not
complete and does not include some important classes of the objects in question. Guided
by the experience of working with quantum lens spaces that correspond to classically
non-singular case, [21], graph C ∗-algebras appear to oﬀer an eﬀective tool to ﬁll in
this gap in our understanding of the structure of the relevant C ∗-algebras and their
K-theoretic invariants. We are exploiting this opportunity here.

A directed graph G = (G0, G1, ̺, σ) consists of two sets G0 and G1 (the former the
set of vertices and the latter the set of edges) and two mappings ̺, σ : G1 → G0, called
the range and source, respectively. Given a graph G with countably many vertices and
edges, C ∗(G) denotes the C ∗-algebra deﬁned as follows, [17]. C ∗(G) is the universal
C ∗-algebra generated by a set {Pv | v ∈ G0} of mutually orthogonal projections and a
set {Se | e ∈ G1} of partial isometries which satisfy the following relations, for all edges
e 6= f ∈ G1 and all vertices v ∈ G0 emitting a ﬁnite number of edges,

Graph C ∗-algebras include important classes of operator algebras, such as the Cuntz-
Krieger algebras [14] or AF algebras. Signiﬁcant advantage of working with graph C ∗-
algebras stems from the ease with which one can calculate their K-theory and primitive
ideal spectrum. This feature of graph C ∗-algebras has been widely exploited in their
applications to the classiﬁcation programme of general C ∗-algebras (for example, see
[30], [28], [16] or [4]). In addition, they have inﬂuenced recent developments in purely
algebraic ring theory, leading to the introduction of Leavitt path algebras [2] in an at-
tempt to explore their classiﬁcation power beyond operator algebra theory; see [1] for
an illuminating review. More importantly from the point of view of the subject matter
of this text, algebras of continuous functions on quantum spheres and on deformations
of non-singular lens spaces can also be interpreted as graph C ∗-algebras [20], [21]. We
extend this interpretation to quantum deformations of all (weighted) lens spaces, in-
cluding those that are classically singular, and employ it to compute the K-theory of a
fairly general class of quantum weighted projective spaces and of particular examples of
(weighted, singular) quantum lens spaces.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we ﬁrst recall the algebraic deﬁnition
of quantum lens spaces. The coordinate algebras of quantum lens spaces are deﬁned as
ﬁxed points of the weighted action of the cyclic group ZN on (the generators of) the
coordinate algebra of the quantum odd-dimensional sphere. We make no assumption on
the existence of common factors of weights and the order of the group. Next, using the
identiﬁcation of the algebra of continuous functions on the quantum odd dimensional
sphere with the graph C ∗-algebra associated to a graph L2n+1 [20], we extend the cyclic
group action to the action on this algebra. The resulting ﬁxed point algebra has been
shown in [21] to be a graph C ∗-algebra, provided all weights are coprime with the
order of the acting group. We extend this identiﬁcation to all weights, thus relaxing
the coprimeness assumption. Similarly to [21] we construct a suitable graph LN ;m
2n+1 by
relating it to the skew product graph L2n+1 ×c ZN (where the labelling c is determined by
the weights), and using the result of Crisp [13] that ﬁxed points of a ﬁnite group action

QUANTUM LENS AND WEIGHTED PROJECTIVE SPACES

on a graph C ∗-algebra can be identiﬁed with speciﬁc corner of the algebra associated
to the skew product graph. The construction of LN ;m
2n+1 explores the values of weights
modulo the order of the cyclic group and thus heavily depends on them; we illustrate
this by a series of examples. The identiﬁcation of the algebras of continuous functions on
quantum lens spaces as algebras associated to explicitly described graphs allows one for
more eﬀective calculation of their K-groups, in particular the K0-groups; we illustrate
it be a series of examples too.

In Section 3, we study algebras of continuous functions on quantum weighted projec-
tive spaces WPn
q (m0, . . . , mn). On the algebraic level these are deﬁned as ﬁxed points of
weighted circle group actions on the quantum odd dimensional sphere, [9]. On the other
hand they can also be identiﬁed with a free or principal [11] action of the circle group
on quantum lens spaces such that all weights divide the order of the cyclic group, [10].
Both actions can be lifted to actions on continuous functions on quantum spheres and
lens spaces. The analysis of algebraic structure of quantum weighted projective spaces,
in particular of deriving generators and relations, is notoriously diﬃcult, as one has to
deal not only with an increasing number of generators but also with relative divisibility
properties of the weights. Until now, even in the lowest dimensional case, n = 1, the
algebraic and operator algebraic structure of WP1
q(m0, m1) has been understood com-

in the case the weights of the form mi = Qj6=i lj, where l0, . . . , ln are pairwise coprime

integers. Furthermore, such a list of generators is given in [10] provided all the weights
but the last one are equal to 1. We prove that the algebra of continuous functions on

q(1, m) (with
m = m1/ gcd(m0, m1)). Finally we derive a short exact sequence which characterises
quantum weighted projective spaces with weights m0, . . . , mn−1 coprime with mn, and
use it to compute their K-theory in the case the weights have the property that for each
j ≥ 1 there is an i < j so that mi and mj are relatively prime.

q(m0, m1) is isomorphic to the quantum teardrop WP1

quantum (weighted) lens spaces are graph C ∗-algebras.

The algebra of continuous functions on the quantum odd-dimensional sphere C(S2n+1

where q is a real number, q ∈ (0, 1); see [27]. As explained in [20], the algebra C(S2n+1
)
can be interpreted as a C ∗-algebra associated to a graph L2n+1 deﬁned as follows. L2n+1
has n + 1 vertices v0, v1, . . . , vn, and (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 edges eij, i = 0, . . . , n, j = i, . . . , n,
with vi the source and vj the range of eij.

algebra provided all the mi are coprime with N. We extend this result to the general
case with arbitrary weight vector m, below.

It is shown in [21] that C(L2n+1

As a matter of fact, C(L2n+1

(N; m)) is isomorphic to the full corner of the graph
C ∗-algebra associated to the skew product graph L2n+1 ×c ZN , where the labelling c
is induced from the ZN -action ̺N
m , namely c : eij 7→ mi mod N. More explicitly, the
graph L2n+1 ×c ZN has vertices (vi, r), i = 0, . . . , n, r = 0, . . . , N − 1 and edges (eij, r),
i, j = 0, . . . n, i ≤ j, r = 0, . . . N − 1, with (vi, r − mi mod N) being the source and
(vj, r) being the range of (eij, r). For example, the skew product graph corresponding
to n = 1, N = 6, m0 = 1, m1 = 3, comes out as

following way. LN ;m

through (vk, t), with k = i + 1, . . . , j − 1 and t = 0, . . . , gcd(mk, N) − 1; such paths are
termed admissible. Since there are no edges (eij, r) in L2n+1 ×c ZN with i > j, one may
assume that i ≤ j in ers
ij;a. We refer to the index i as labelling the levels, and to index r
as labelling the loops in LN ;m

and observe that di is coprime with mi/ci. The admissible paths from (vi, r) to (vj, s)

where

(2.7)

Xa=1

(all sums are computed modulo N), and no vertex appears twice as the range (or,
equivalently, source) of any of the edges that compose into the path (2.6). There are no
admissible paths between (vi, r) and (vi, s) if r 6= s. Indeed if there were such a path,
then there would exist integers a, b such that

(2.8)

r − s = ami − bN.

The right hand side is divisible by ci, while the left hand side is not, since |r − s| < ci,
which gives the desired contradiction. On the other hand, there is exactly one path
connecting (vi, r) with itself:

(2.9)

(eii, r + mi)(eii, r + 2mi) . . . (eii, r + (di − 1)mi)(eii, r).

To see that (2.9) is admissible, ﬁrst note that

r + dimi = r +

N
ci

mi = r +

mi
ci

N ≡ r mod N,

so that the condition in (2.7) is satisﬁed. Furthermore there are no edges in (2.9) with
the same source. Otherwise, there would need to exist integers a, b ∈ 0, . . . , di − 1 such
that r + ami = r + bmi modulo N. This would imply the existence of c ∈ Z such that
(a − b)mi = cN or, when both sides are divided by ci,

(2.10)

(a − b)

mi
ci

= cdi.

Since |a − b| < di and di is coprime with mi/ci, the left hand side is not divisible by di,
which gives the required contradiction. By the same token, (2.9) is the shortest path
connecting (vi, r) with itself. Any longer path would need to pass through the same
vertex at least twice, hence it would not be admissible. This proves the uniqueness.
Thus, If i = j, nrs
2n+1 and
there are no links between vertices vr

ii = δrs, i.e. there is a single loop attached to each vertex in LN ;m

If all the mi are coprime with N, the graph LN ;m

2n+1 coincides with the graph described
in [21, p. 257–258]. At the other extreme, i.e. if all the mi divide N, then the graph
LN ;m
2n+1 consists of n + 1 levels of interconnected loops with mi mutually disconnected
loops at the i-th level.
Example 2.1. (1) Lkl;1,l
consists of one loop at level 0 and l-loops at level 1 with k links
connecting the loop in level 0 with each of the loops at level 1, so the corresponding
graph is:

Sα 7→ S(eii1 ,r+mi)S(ei1 i2 ,r1) · · · S(eik ik+1 ,rk)S(eik+1 j,s),

extends to a C ∗-algebra isomorphism.

In view of the universal property of the graph C ∗-algebra, to prove that ψ extends
to a ∗-homomorphism it suﬃces to check that the images of the Pvr
i and Sα under ψ
satisfy relations (1.1) for LN ;m
2n+1. Conditions (1.1a) are obvious. To prove (1.1b), we ﬁx
(vi, r) ∈ L2n+1 ×c ZN , and, for any ν ∈ N, split the set of all admissible paths from (vi, r)
into the subsets Aν of those of length less than n and Bν of those of length exactly ν.

All the paths

β′ = (eii1, r + mi)(ei1i2, r1) . . . (eikik+1, rk)(eik+1j, s)(ejl, s + mj)

that appear in (2.15) are admissible, which is obvious in case l 6= s. Otherwise, this
follows by the observation that no segment of an admissible path that is not a loop
can have length greater than di − 1 at any given level i (otherwise the path would pass
through the same vertex at least twice); if an edge with both the source and range at the
level i is added its range will be a vertex that is not a range for any edge yet, otherwise
one is led to contradiction as in (2.10). Therefore, β′ ∈ Aν+1 \ Aν or β′ ∈ Bν+1 and,

By the principle of mathematical induction, (2.14) holds for all natural ν.

Since L2n+1 ×c ZN is a ﬁnite graph there exists ν such that Bν is an empty set, and
hence relation (1.1b) for P(vi,r) = ψ(Pvr
i ) is equivalent to (2.14) for this ν. This proves
that ψ extends to a ∗-homomorphism, which we still denote ψ. To prove that ψ is
injective, we apply the general Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem, [29, Theorem 1.2].
Clearly, ψ(P(vi,r)) 6= 0 for all vertices vr
i . Also, the only loops without exits in graph
LN ;m
nn;1 attached to vertices at level n. For all r = 0, . . . cn − 1,
we have

2n+1 are the edges er

n := err

ψ(Ser

n) = (enn, r + mn)(enn, r + 2mn) . . . (enn, r + (dn − 1)mn)(enn, r).

It follows from the last part of the proof of Theorem 2.4 in [22] that this is a partial
unitary with full spectrum. Thus the hypothesis of [29, Theorem 1.2] holds and ψ is
injective.

Finally, we need to prove that ψ is surjective. First, let us consider a path α with
source and range both in the set {(vi, 0) | i = 0, . . . , n}. Since every loop in the crossed-
product graph L2n+1 ×c ZN passes through one of the vertices (vi, ri), ri = 0, . . . ci − 1,
i = 0, . . . , n, the path α is a concatenation of admissible paths, i.e. α = α1α2 . . . αk,
with all the αk admissible. Therefore Sα = Sα1Sα2 · · · Sαk is in the image of C ∗(LN ;m

under ψ. ⊔⊓

[10, Proposition 5.2], the more diﬃcult computation of K0(C(L2n+1
(N; m))) boils down
to detailed analysis of numbers of links connecting various loops and then to derive the
Smith normal form of the matrix corresponding to the transformation Φ. Recall [26]
that every integer matrix A can be reduced (by row and column operations) to the
diagonal form with entries 0 or α1, . . . , αn, where

where the ∆i are greatest common divisiors of all minors of A of size i. The torsion part
of the cokernel of the transformation deﬁned by A is then

Zα1 ⊕ Zα2 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Zαn.

Below we give three examples of this.

of K0(C(L7

and it splits into two parts. If α is divisible by k, then the matrix can be reduced to

Hence β modulo k has to be a multiple of the sixth of k, and, in the case of even k, β
modulo k/2 has to be a multiple of the third of k/2. The analysis of all these possibilities
yields the stated form of K0(C(L7

Remark 2.7. If l = 1, the results of Example 2.4 agree with that of [21, Proposition 2.3].

3. K-theory of quantum weighted projective spaces

The aim of this section is to calculate K-theory of a fairly general class of quan-
tum weighted projective spaces and to give a complete description of C ∗-algebras of
continuous functions on quantum weighted projective lines as graph AF-algebras.

As before, we ﬁx a sequence of positive integers m := m0, . . . , mn. In addition to the

ZN -action (2.2), the algebra C(S2n+1

q

) admits the circle group action ̺m,

(3.1)

̺m : zi 7→ ξmizi,

i = 0, . . . , n,

where ξ is the unitary generator of T (of inﬁnite order). Fixed points C(WPn

where the (non-trivial) monomorphism is ξ 7→ ξN and the (non-trivial) epimorphism is

We describe C ∗-algebras of the quantum weighted projective spaces WP1

q(m), m =
(m0, m1), as AF graph algebras. Let g := gcd(m0, m1), ˜m0 := m0/g and ˜m1 := m1/g,
and deﬁne a graph W1(m) as follows. The graph has ˜m1+1 vertices, denoted w0, . . . , w ˜m1.

(3.2)
Proposition 3.1. For all values of m = (m0, m1), C(WP1
morphic to the graph C ∗-algebra C ∗(W1(m)). Consequently,

q(m)) is an AF-algebra iso-

K0(C(WP1

q(m))) = Z1+m1/ gcd(m0,m1),

K1(C(WP1

q(m))) = 0.

Proof. As explained above, C(WP1

q(m)) is isomorphic to the C ∗-algebra of ﬁxed points
for the generalized gauge action of the circle group T on the graph algebra C ∗(L3), such
that

̺m(Seij ) = ξmiSeij

for i = 0, 1, j = i, 1.

We denote this ﬁxed point algebra C ∗(L3)̺m and we construct a C ∗-algebra isomorphism
φ : C ∗(W1(m)) → C ∗(L3)̺m. At ﬁrst we ﬁnd targets for the generators of C ∗(W1(m))
inside C ∗(L3). Let

for j = 2, . . . , ˜m1,

for k ∈ N,
e01(S∗

e00)j−2,

for k ∈ N, j = 2, . . . , ˜m1.

Clearly, these elements of C ∗(L3) are ̺m-invariant and satisfy the deﬁning relations
for the graph algebra C ∗(W1(m)). Thus, this assignment extends uniquely to a ∗-
homomorphism φ : C ∗(W1(m)) → C ∗(L3)̺m. Injectivity of φ follows from [29, Theorem
1.2], since there are no closed paths in graph W3(m) and φ(Pwj ) 6= 0 for all j = 0, . . . , ˜m1.
It remains to verify that the map φ is surjective. First of all, C ∗(L3) is a closed span
of elements of the form SαS∗
β, where α and β are two paths with the common range.
The action ̺m rescales each such an element by a suitable power of ξ. Applying the
conditional expectation from C ∗(L3) onto C ∗(L3)̺m (integration over the orbits), we see
that the ﬁxed point algebra C ∗(L3)̺m is spanned by those elements SαS∗
β which are ﬁxed
by ̺m. Hence it suﬃces to show that all such elements are in the range of φ.
If both α and β end at v0, then we must have α = β and thus SαS∗

β = Pv0 =
j=2 φ(Pwj ). So suppose that α and β end at v1. If both α and β contain
β = Pv1 = φ(Pw1). So we

It remains to consider the case α = ek

11 for some k, l, p, s ∈ N.
As above, from the start we may assume that p = 0. We must have m0(k + 1) = m0(l +

m = m1/ gcd(m0, m1).

q(m0, m1) is isomorphic to the quantum teardrop WP1

Proposition 3.2. Let m := m0, . . . , mn be positive integers such that there exists j ∈

span of all SαS∗
β ∈ C ∗(L2n+1)̺m such that α, β are paths in L2n+1 with both α and β
ending at vertex mn. Then J is a closed, two-sided ideal of C ∗(L2n+1)̺m such that the
quotient C ∗(L2n+1)̺m/J is isomorphic to C ∗(L2n−1)̺m ∼= C(WPn−1

K1(C(WPn

Proof. We proceed by induction on n. Case n = 1 being contained in Proposition 3.1.

Applying the K-functor to (3.3) we obtain the six-term exact sequence

Since outer terms in the bottom row vanish (the left one by inductive assumption) also
the middle term is 0, as required. Thus again using the inductive assumption and the
K-theory of compact operators we obtain a short exact sequence
