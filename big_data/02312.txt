ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES OF JACOBI MATRICES FOR A FAMILY OF

FRACTAL MEASURES

G ¨OKALP ALPAN, ALEXANDER GONCHAROV, AND AHMET N˙IHAT S¸ ˙IMS¸ EK

ABSTRACT. We study the properties and asymptotics of the Jacobi matrices associated with
equilibrium measures of the weakly equilibrium Cantor sets. These family of Cantor sets
were deﬁned and different aspects of orthogonal polynomials on them were studied recently.
Our main aim is numerically examine some conjectures concerning orthogonal polynomi-
als which do not directly follow from previous results. We also compare our results with
more general conjectures made for recurrence coefﬁcients associated with fractal measures
supported on R.

1. INTRODUCTION

For a unit Borel measure m with an inﬁnite compact support on R, using the Gram-
Schmidt process for the set {1, x, x2, . . .} in L2(m ), one can ﬁnd a sequence of polynomials
(qn(·; m ))

n=0 satisfying

Z qm(x; m )qn(x; m ) dm (x) = d mn

where qn(·; m ) is of degree n. Here, qn(·; m )) is called the n-th orthonormal polynomial for
m . We denote its positive leading coefﬁcient by k n and n-th monic orthogonal polynomial
qn(·; m )/k n by Qn(·; m ). If we assume that Q−1(·; m ) := 0 and Q0(·; m ) := 1 then there are
n=0 satisfy a
two bounded sequences (an)
three-term recurrence relation

n=1 such that the polynomials (Qn(·; m ))

n=1, (bn)

Qn+1(x; m ) = (x− bn+1)Qn(x; m )− a2

n Qn−1(x; m ),

n ∈ N0,

Conversely, if two bounded sequences (an)

where an > 0, bn ∈ R and N0 = N∪{0}.
n=1 are given with an > 0 and
bn ∈ R for each n ∈ N then we can deﬁne the corresponding Jacobi matrix H, which is a
self-adjoint bounded operator acting on l2(N), as the following,

The (scalar valued) spectral measure m of H for the cyclic vector (1, 0, . . .)T is the measure

reader to [48, 56].

n=−¥ be a two sided sequence taking values on C and c j = (cn+ j)

for
Let c = (cn)
j ∈ Z. Then c is called almost periodic if {c j} j∈Z is precompact in l¥
(Z). A one-sided
sequence d = (dn)
n=1 is called almost periodic if it is the restriction of a two sided almost
periodic sequence to N. Each one sided almost periodic sequence has only one extension to
Z which is almost periodic, see Section 5.13 in [48]. Hence one-sided and two sided almost
periodic sequences are essentially the same objects. A Jacobi matrix Hm
is called almost
n=1 for m are almost
periodic if the sequences of recurrence coefﬁcients (an)
periodic. We consider in the following sections only one-sided sequences due to the nature
of our problems but, in general, for the almost periodicity, it is much more natural to consider
sequences on Z instead of N.

n=1 and (bn)

A sequence s = (sn)

n=1 is called asymptotically almost periodic if there is an almost pe-
n=1 such that dn − sn → 0 as n → ¥
. In this case d is unique and
riodic sequence d = (dn)
it is called the almost periodic limit. See [42, 48, 51] for more details on almost periodic
functions.

Several sufﬁcient conditions on Hm

to be almost periodic or asymptotically almost peri-
odic are given in [41, 49] for the case when ess supp(m ) (that is the support of m excluding
its isolated points) is a Parreau-Widom set (Section 3) or in particular homogeneous set in
the sense of Carleson (see [41] for the deﬁnition). We remark that some symmetric Cantor
sets and generalized Julia sets (see [41, 5]) are Parreau-Widom. By [11, 59], for equilibrium
measures of some polynomial Julia sets corresponding Jacobi matrices are almost periodic. It
was conjectured in [37, 33] that Jacobi matrices for self-similar measures including the Can-
tor measure are asymptotically almost periodic. We should also mention that some almost
periodic Jacobi matrices with applications to physics (see e.g. [8]), has essential spectrum
equal to a Cantor set.

There are many open problems regarding orthogonal polynomials on Cantor sets, such as
how to deﬁne the Szeg˝o class of measures and isospectral torus (see e.g. [21, 22] for the
previous results and [32, 33, 36, 38, 39] for possible extensions of the theory and important
conjectures) especially when the support has zero Lebesgue measure. The family of sets that
we consider here contains both positive and zero Lebesgue measure sets, Parreau-Widom
and non Parreau-Widom sets. Widom-Hilbert factors (see Section 2 for the deﬁnition) for
equilibrium measures of the weakly equilibrium Cantor sets may be bounded or unbounded
depending on the particular choice of parameters. Some properties of these measures related
to orthogonal polynomials were already studied in detail but till now we do not have complete
characterizations of most of the properties mentioned above in terms of the parameters. Our
results and conjectures are meant to suggest some formulations of theorems for further work
on these sets as well as other Cantor sets.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review the previous results on K(g )
and provide evidence for the numerical stability of the algorithm obtained in Section 4 in [4]
for calculating the recurrence coefﬁcients. In Section 3, we discuss the behavior of recur-
rence coefﬁcients in different aspects and propose some conjectures about the character of
periodicity of the Jacobi matrices. In Section 4, the properties of Widom factors are investi-
gated. We also prove that the sequence of Widom-Hilbert factors for the equilibrium measure

of autonomous quadratic Julia sets is unbounded above as soon as the Julia set is totally dis-
connected. In the last section, we study local behavior of the spacing properties of the zeros
of orthogonal polynomials for the equilibrium measures of weakly equilibrium Cantor sets
and make a few comments on possible consequences of our numerical experiments.

For a general overview on potential theory we refer the reader to [45, 46]. For a non-

polar compact set K ⊂ C, the equilibrium measure is denoted by m K while Cap(K) stands
for the logarithmic capacity of K. The Green’s function for the connected component of
C \ K containing inﬁnity is denoted by GK(z). Convergence of measures is understood as
weak-star convergence. For the sup norm on K and for the Hilbert norm on L2(m ) we use
k·kL¥

(K) and k·kL2(m ) respectively.

2. PRELIMINARIES AND NUMERICAL STABILITY OF THE ALGORITHM
Let us repeat the construction of K(g ) which was introduced in [30]. Let g = (g s)
s=1 be a
s=1 2−s log (1/g s) < ¥
sequence such that 0 < g s < 1/4 holds for each s ∈ N provided that (cid:229)

Set r0 = 1 and rs = g sr2
z2/(2g n) + 1− 1/(2g n) for n > 1. Here E0 := [0, 1] and En := F−1
([−1, 1]) where Fn is used
to denote fn ◦···◦ f1. Then, En is a union of 2n disjoint non-degenerate closed intervals in
[0, 1] and En ⊂ En−1 for all n ∈ N. Moreover, K(g ) := ∩
n=0En is a non-polar Cantor set in
[0, 1] where {0, 1} ⊂ K(g ). It is not hard to see that for each different g we end up with a
different K(g ).
It is shown in Section 3 of [4] that for all s ∈ N0 we have

The diagonal elements, the bn’s of Hm K(g ), are equal to 0, 5 by Section 4 in [4]. For the

outdiagonal elements by Theorem 4.3 in [4] we have the following relations:
(2.2)

a1 = kQ1(cid:0)·; m K(g )(cid:1)kL2(m K(g )),
a2 = kQ2(cid:0)·; m K(g )(cid:1)kL2(m K(g ))/kQ1(cid:0)·; m K(g )(cid:1)kL2(m K(g )).

v1,n(t) = √1− 2g n + 2g nt and v2,n(t) = −v1,n(t). Then the zero set of Q2s(cid:0)·; m K(g )(cid:1)

for all i, j ∈ N then m K(g )([0, ei]) ⊂ {m2−n}m,n∈N where ei ∈ (ci, di). Moreover for
each m ∈ N and n ∈ N with m2−n < 1 there is an i ∈ N such that m K(g )([0, ei]) = m2−n.

We consider 4 different models depending on g in the whole article. They are:
(1) g s = 1/4− (1/(50 + s)4).
(2) g s = 1/4− (1/(50 + s)2).
(3) g s = 1/4− (1/(50 + s)(5/4).
(4) g s = 1/4− (1/50).

Model 1 represents an example where K(g ) is Parreau-Widom and Model 2 gives a non
Parreau-Widom set with fast growth of g . Model 3 produces a non Parreau-Widom K(g ) with
relatively slow growth of g but still GK(g ) is optimally smooth. Model 4 yields a set which
is neither Parreau-Widom nor the Green’s function for the complement of it is optimally
smooth. We used Matlab in all of the experiments.

If f is a nonlinear polynomial having real coefﬁcients with real and simple zeros x1 <
x2 < . . . < xn and distinct extremas y1 < . . . < yn−1 where | f (yi)| > 1 for i = 1, 2, . . ., n− 1,
we say that f is an admissible polynomial. Clearly, for any choice of g , fn is admissible for
each n ∈ N and this implies by Lemma 4.3 in [5] that Fn is also admissible. By the remark

after Theorem 4 and Theorem 11 in [28] it follows that the Christoffel numbers (see p. 565

It is also known that (see e.g. Remark 4.8 in [4]) lim infan > 0 for m K provided that K is
Parreau-Widom. For more on Parreau-Widom sets, we refer the reader to [20, 59].
It
also follows from Remark 4.8 in [4] and [25] that if the an’s associated with m K(g ) sat-
isfy lim infan = 0 then K(g ) has zero Lebesgue measure. Hence asymptotic behavior of the
an’s is also important for understanding the Hausdorff dimension of K(g ). We computed

Theorem 1.12 in [48] and also [57]) m K(g ). Therefore, if x is chosen from one of the gaps (by
a gap of a compact set on K ⊂ R we mean a bounded component of R\ K) of supp(cid:0)m K(g )(cid:1),
that is x ∈ (ci, di) (see part (i) of Theorem 2.1) then the value of the IDS is equal to m2−n

always countable and c can be written as a uniform limit of Fourier series where the fre-
quencies are chosen among M (c). For an almost periodic Jacobi matrix H with coefﬁcients

and M (b). It was shown in Theorem III.1 in [24] that for an almost periodic H, the values
of IDS in gaps belong to M (H). Moreover, (see e.g. Theorem 2.4 in [27]), an asymptoti-
cally almost periodic Jacobi matrix has the same density of states measure with the almost
periodic limit of it.
In order to examine almost periodicity of the an’s for m K(g ) we computed the discrete
n=1 for the ﬁrst 214 coefﬁcients for each model where frequencies run
n=1|ban|2. We plotted (see Figure 5) this

Fourier transform (ban)214
from 0 to 1. We normalized |ba|2 dividing it by (cid:229) 214

normalized power spectrum while we did not plot the peak at 0, by detrending the transform.
There are only a small number of peaks in each case compared to 214 frequencies which
points out almost periodicity of coefﬁcients. We consider only Model 1 here although we
have similar pictures for the other models. The highest 10 peaks are at 0.5, 0.25, 0.75, 0.375, 0.625,
0.4375, 0.5625, 0.125, 0.875, 0.3125. All these values are of the form m2−n where n ≤ 4.
This is an important indicator of almost periodicity as these frequencies are exactly the val-
ues of IDS for Hm K(g ) in the gaps which appear earlier in the construction of the Cantor set.

For the parameters c > 3, Hm J( f ) is almost periodic where f (z) = z2 − c, see [12]. It was
conjectured in [13] that Hm J( f ) is always almost periodic as soon as c > 2. For c = 2, Hm J( f ) is
not almost periodic since a1 = 2 and an = 1 for n ≥ 2 but it is asymptotically almost periodic.
Therefore if this conjecture is true then we have the following: Hm J( f ) is almost periodic if
and only if J( f ) is non Parreau-Widom.

We did not make any distinction between asymptotic almost periodicity and almost peri-
odicity in Section 3 and Section 4 since these two cases are indistinguishable numerically.
But we remark that if lim infan 6= 0 then the asymptotics lim j→¥ a j·2s+n = an cease to hold
immediately. We do not expect Hm K(g ) to be almost periodic for the Parreau-Widom case
for that reason. For a parameter g = (g s)
s=1 such that lim j→¥ a j·2s+n = an holds for each
s and n it is likely that Hm K(g ) is almost periodic. These asymptotics hold only for the non
Parreau-Widom case but it is unclear that if these hold for all parameters making K(g ) non
Parreau-Widom.

Hausdorff dimension of a unit Borel measure m supported on C is deﬁned by dim(m ) :=
inf{HD(K) : m (K) = 1} where HD(·) stands for the Hausdorff dimension of the given set.

Hausdorff dimension of equilibrium measures were studied for many fractals (see [34] for
an account of the previous results) and in particular for autonomous polynomials Julia sets
(see e.g. [44]). If f is a nonlinear monic polyomial and J( f ) is a Cantor set then by p.
176 in[44] (see also p. 22 in [34]) we have dim(cid:0)m J( f )(cid:1) < 1. For K(g ), (cid:229)
s=1√e s < ¥
implies that dim(cid:0)m K(g )(cid:1) = 1 since m
(K(g )) and the Lebesgue measure restricted to K(g ) (see
4.6.1 in [49]) are mutually absolutely continuous. Moreover, our numerical experiments
suggest that K(g ) has zero Lebesgue measure for non Parreau-Widom case.
It may also
be true that dim(cid:0)m K(g )(cid:1) < 1 for this particular case. Hence, it is an interesting problem to
