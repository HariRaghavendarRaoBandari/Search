ABSTRACT

Context. The high-energy radiation from black-hole binaries may be due to the reprocessing of a lamp located on the
black hole rotation axis and emitting X-rays. The observed spectrum is made of three major components: the direct
spectrum traveling from the lamp directly to the observer; the thermal bump at the equilibrium temperature of the
accretion disk heated by the lamp; and the reﬂected spectrum essentially made of the Compton hump and the iron-line
complex.
Aims. We aim at computing accurately the complete reprocessed spectrum (thermal bump + reﬂected) of black-hole
binaries over the entire X-ray band. We also determine the strength of the direct component. Our choice of parameters
is adapted to a source showing an important thermal component. We are particularly interested in investigating the
possibility to use the iron-line complex as a probe to constrain the black hole spin.
Methods. We compute in full general relativity the illumination of a thin accretion disk by a ﬁxed X-ray lamp along
the rotation axis. We use the ATM21 radiative transfer code to compute the local, energy-dependent spectrum emitted
along the disk as a function of radius, emission angle and black hole spin. We then ray trace this local spectrum to
determine the ﬁnal reprocessed spectrum as received by a distant observer. We consider two extreme values of the black
hole spin (a = 0 and a = 0.98) and discuss the dependence of the local and ray-traced spectra on the emission angle
and black hole spin.
Results. We show the importance of the angle dependence of the total disk speciﬁc intensity spectrum emitted by the
illuminated atmosphere when the thermal disk emission if fully taken into account. The disk ﬂux, together with the
X-ray ﬂux from the lamp, determines the temperature and ionization structure of the atmosphere. High black hole
spin implies high temperature in the inner disk regions, therefore the emitted thermal disk spectrum fully covers the
iron-line complex. As a result, instead of ﬂuorescent iron emission line, we locally observe absorption lines produced in
the hot disk atmosphere. Absorption lines are narrow and disappear after ray tracing the local spectrum.
Conclusions. Our results mainly highlight the importance of considering the angle dependence of the local spectrum
when computing reprocessed spectra, as was already found in a recent study. The main new result of our work is to
show the importance of computing the thermal bump of the spectrum, as this feature can change considerably the
observed iron-line complex. Thus, in particular for ﬁtting black hole spins, the full spectrum, and not only the reﬂected
part, should be computed self-consistently.

1. Introduction

It is probable that X-ray spectra emitted by black-hole bi-
naries and active galactic nuclei contain relativistic signa-
tures due to the proximity of the emission region to the
central black hole. In particular, the distortion of the Fe K
line has been since a long time advocated to be due to
relativistic eﬀects (Fabian et al. 1989; Reynolds & Nowak
2003). This feature of the spectrum is used to constrain the
spin parameter of black holes (Reynolds 2014).

The observed X-ray spectra show two components, a
soft and a hard one, that can be naturally explained in the
scenario where an accretion disk is accompanied by some
Comptonizing region, which can be typically either a hot
corona sandwiching the inner region of the disk (Haardt
& Maraschi 1991), a hot inner ﬂow occupying the regions
close to the black hole with the disk being truncated to some
radius (Zdziarski & Gierli´nski 2004; Done et al. 2007), or

the base of a jet located on the rotation axis of the black
hole (see among many others Matt et al. 1991; Martocchia
& Matt 1996; Markoﬀ et al. 2005). In this article we will
only consider this third option, the so-called lamp post
model.

Our aims are (1) to compute the ﬂux of illuminating
radiation from this lamp to the accretion disk, (2) to com-
pute the reﬂected intensity spectrum due to the reprocess-
ing of the illuminating ﬂux by the disk and (3) to ray trace
this to a distant observer. Many works have been inves-
tigating these various points in the past. Point (1) and
(3) essentially deal with the eﬀect of light bending from
a lamp post to the illuminated accretion disk and then
to the distant observer (see among others Reynolds et al.
1999; Ruszkowski 2000; Miniutti et al. 2003; Miniutti &
Fabian 2004; Fukumura & Kazanas 2007; Wilkins & Fabian
2012; Dauser et al. 2013; Dovciak et al. 2014). Point (2)
requires solving the complex radiative transfer in the illu-

minated accretion disk and has also been investigated by
many authors since quite a long time, taking into account
either Newtonian or general-relativistic illumination, solv-
ing the radiative transfer equations in a Newtonian frame-
work, and assuming the reﬂection from a constant-density
slab (see among others George & Fabian 1991; Matt et al.
1991; Ross & Fabian 1993; Zycki & Czerny 1994; Czerny &
Zycki 1994; Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995; Poutanen et al.
1996; Nied´zwiecki & ˙Zycki 2008; Garc´ıa & Kallman 2010).
In addition, the assumption of a stratiﬁed gas being in hy-
drostatic equilibrium is more realistic but more complex
from a numerical point of view (Nayakshin & Kallman 2001;
Ballantyne et al. 2001; R´o˙za´nska et al. 2002; R´o˙za´nska &
Madej 2008; R´o˙za´nska et al. 2011). In particular, R´o˙za´nska
& Madej (2008, together with the subsequent works of the
same authors) solve the radiative equilibrium which was
not dealt with previously, to our knowledge, by any other
group. The most advanced attempt to take into account
points (1), (2) and (3) is the work of Garc´ıa et al. (2014),
which was the main motivation for the development of this
article. These authors, however, still consider the reﬂection
from a constant-density slab and that the illumination is
incident on the disk at a constant angle equal to 45◦.

This article’s treatment of point (1) and (3) is close
to the treatment of Dauser et al. (2013) and Garc´ıa et al.
(2014). However, there are two important diﬀerences. The
ﬁrst one is that we take into account the redshift eﬀect on
the frequency cut-oﬀs assumed in the lamp frame (see the
discussion in Nied´zwiecki et al. 2016). The second one is
that we do not assume a 45◦ incidence of the illumination
but rather consider the true direction of incidence to com-
pute the mean illuminating intensity. As far as point (2)
is concerned, there is an important diﬀerence between our
treatment and the one of Garc´ıa et al. (2014), which is the
main reason for us to revisit this topic. We are computing
local intensity spectra using the code ATM21 of R´o˙za´nska
et al. (2011). This code solves the hydrostatic and radiative
equilibria of the disk self-consistently, taking into account a
slim disk solution (S¸adowski et al. 2011) with a given spin
parameter. The full spectrum, including the thermal bump
due to the radiation of the accretion disk heated by the
lamp, is computed. Garc´ıa et al. (2014) do not solve the hy-
drostatic equilibrium and rather assume a constant-density
slab. Moreover, they only compute the reﬂected part of
the spectrum and do not consider the thermal bump. As
far as the value of spin is concerned, this means that only
the inner radius of the disk (supposed to be at the inner-
most stable circular orbit, the ISCO, which depends on the
spin parameter) takes spin into account in Garc´ıa et al.
(2014). Besides this, the disk physics is the same whatever
the spin. This is an important simpliﬁcation and it was
highlighted by Nayakshin & Kallman (2001) that the two
options (considering a constant-density slab or solving the
hydrostatics of the disk) do not lead to the same predic-
tions. Moreover, as we are particularly interested in taking
as much as possible general-relativistic eﬀects into account
(particularly spin eﬀects), we believe that it is important to
solve the hydrostatic equilibrium for the particular value of
spin parameter assumed for the central black hole. We note
that our treatment is not 100% relativistic as the radiative
transfer is solved in a Newtonian spacetime (similarly as
in Garc´ıa et al. 2014). However, given that point (2) is re-
stricted to local phenomena, we do not think that this may
have important consequences on the modeled spectra. We

thus believe that the simulations we present are among the
most realistic to date, as far as taking spin eﬀect into ac-
count is concerned. Understanding spin eﬀects imprinted in
the reﬂected spectrum is particularly important given that
the Fe K line is one of the probe of black hole spins and will
be used by high-precision future mission like Hitomi (for-
merly ASTRO-H, Takahashi et al. 2014; Miller et al. 2014;
Reynolds et al. 2014) and ATHENA (Nandra et al. 2013;
Dovciak et al. 2013).

This article aims at simulating accurately the observed
spectrum generated by a simple lamp post scenario. Our
ﬁrst goal is to compute accurately the ﬂux emanating from
the lamp and illuminating the disk (Section 2). We will
compute the illuminating ﬂux either in a Newtonian space-
time or in the Kerr spacetime with spin parameter a = 0
and a = 0.98. This allows us to compare the resulting local
speciﬁc intensity reﬂected spectrum, emitted by the disk
at some emission angle towards the Earth, for these three
kinds of illuminations. Our second goal is to compute the
local reﬂected spectrum due to the reprocessing of the il-
luminating ﬂux by the disk (Section 3.1). Our third goal
is to ray trace this local spectrum to a distant observer
(Section 3.2). Finally, Section 4 gives conclusions and per-
spectives.

2. Illuminating mean intensity

We consider a spherical source of radiation (the lamp) lo-
cated along the rotation axis of a black hole, at some co-
ordinate z. The radius of the spherical source is assumed
small enough so that it is perceived as point-like by any
observer rotating with the disk. In our simulations, this ra-
dius is R = 0.25 M , where M is the black hole mass. We
consider a set of corotating observers1 in the disk at several
coordinate radii r. The global accretion disk model consid-
ered for computing the reﬂected spectrum is a slim disk
as described by S¸adowski et al. (2011) with an accretion
rate ˙m = 0.01 ˙mEdd, where the Eddington accretion rate
deﬁned as ˙mEdd = 16 LEdd/c2. For this moderate accre-
tion rate, the disk is very thin (H/r ≈ 0.05) and the gas
follows nearly Keplerian orbits. We thus consider a set of
Keplerian observers, corotating with the disk at the local
Keplerian angular velocity. For each of these observers we
perform backwards-in-time ray tracing from the observer
towards the lamp in order to determine the illuminating
ﬂux received by each observer.

For all ray-tracing computations presented in this arti-
cle, we use the open-source2 GYOTO code (Vincent et al.
2011). Photons are traced by integrating the geodesic equa-
tion using a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg adaptive-step integra-
tor at order 7/8 (meaning that the method is 8th order,
with an error estimation at 7th order).

We consider a lamp emitting isotropically in its rest
frame. This is obviously a simplifying hypothesis that is
most likely not to be satisﬁed in a realistic context. Indeed,
the X-ray radiation from the lamp is likely to be produced
by the Comptonization of photons emitted by the accretion
disk (see e.g. the recent discussion in Dovciak & Done 2015).
This process would lead to anisotropic radiation. Moreover,

1 Note that these observers are diﬀerent from the ﬁnal ob-
server, located on Earth at a very large distance away from the
black hole.

we also neglect the motion of the source and it has already
been discussed in the literature that the lamp motion aﬀects
the reﬂected spectrum (Wilkins & Fabian 2012; Dauser
et al. 2013). A realistic treatment of the Comptonization
of the disk’s photons by a moving source goes beyond the
scope of the present paper. The lamp is thus emitting ra-
diation isotropically in its rest frame following a power-law
spectrum over the X-ray band

where νlamp is the emitted frequency as measured in the
rest frame of the lamp, α is the spectral index and A is a
normalizing constant to be determined later on. The fre-
quencies νlamp,1 and νlamp,2 are the limits of the illumi-
nation band. Once the ray-tracing computation has been
performed, it is possible to determine what is the angle i
in each Keplerian observer’s rest frame between the local
normal and the direction of the lamp on sky, as well as the
value of the speciﬁc intensity received by each Keplerian
observer corotating at coordinate radius r

where νdisk is the observed frequency, as measured in the

in the disk frame are obtained from their lamp-frame coun-
terparts by using νdisk,i = g νlamp,i. Figure 1 illustrates the
geometry and the image of the lamp as seen by the given
Keplerian observer.

Let us now derive the illuminating ﬂux in the direction
normal to the disk, in order to properly deﬁne the normal-
izing constant A. It reads

where we introduce the quantity F(r) = (cid:82) g3+α cos i dΩ

which is independent of the frequency. Figure 2, left panel,
shows the evolution of this quantity with radius for three
diﬀerent small values of the lamp altitude z and for a spec-
tral index of α = 1. This Figure shows a perfect agree-
ment with Figure 2, lower panel, of Dauser et al. (2013).
We consider this test as a consistency check with previous
works. We are able to compute precisely illuminating ﬂuxes
or mean intensities for any kind of lamp position and geom-
etry. We are also able to consider either a black-hole met-
ric, or ﬂat spacetime in order to compare Newtonian and
general-relativistic (GR) illuminating ﬂuxes or mean inten-
sities. Newtonian illuminating mean intensities are com-
puted by assuming a Minkowski metric, an observer at rest

at coordinate radius r, and ﬁxing to g = 1 the redshift
factor (in order to remove all relativistic eﬀects including
special relativistic eﬀects that would still be present in a
Minkowski spacetime if g is not ﬁxed to 1).
At this stage, we only need to deﬁne the normalizing
constant A in order to compute mean intensities I(r) in
cgs units. We do this by choosing one particular value of
the total X-ray luminosity illuminating an accretion disk.
This total luminosity can be written

where νlamp is the lamp-frame frequency which is varied
in the X band between νlamp,1 and νlamp,2, νdisk(r) is the
corresponding redshifted frequency at radius r in the disk
frame, and dSdisk(r) is the inﬁnitesimal disk area between
r and r + dr in the disk frame. The factor of 2 in this
expression is justiﬁed by considering a symmetric source,
illuminating both sides of the disk. We note that our nu-
merical treatment only considers illumination from one side
of the disk. However, in a realistic situation (for instance
if the source is the base of a jet), this illuminating source
should be present on both sides of he disk. The luminosity
LX,illum above is deﬁned in order to normalize all quantities
to realistic values. As a consequence, it should contain this
factor of 2. Considering two symmetric sources in the nu-
merical treatment would not change anything because the
observer will always see only one side of the disk (neglect-
ing the small contribution of the very gravitationally bent
radiation coming from the lower side that can be seen from
the upper side of the disk). In the Kerr metric, the redshift
factor g is known analytically so that we may write in the
equatorial plane

not strictly speaking point-like so the angle i is equal to the average of all the directions on sky connecting the observer
to the lamp. Note also that the lamp appears shifted with respect to the local normal because of the special relativistic
eﬀect linked to the high velocity of the observer. The displacement is in the direction of the observer’s motion.

problem for a = 0 and to use the same normalization what-
ever the spin. This means that LX,illum will not be the same
for diﬀerent spins, it is rather the lamp which is kept the
same for all simulations.
For a spin-0 black hole, we consider a luminosity of
LX,illum(a = 0) = 1036 erg s−1. This choice ﬁxes the nor-
malizing constant A, which is kept the same for both a = 0
and a = 0.98. The corresponding illuminating luminosity
for a = 0.98 is LX,illum(a = 0.98) = 1.3 × 1036 erg s−1.
We note that the accretion-related luminosity is equal
LX,acc = 2 × 1037 erg s−1 with our choice of accretion rate
and taking an accretion eﬃciency of η = 0.1. This means
that the accretion luminosity is bigger than the illumination
by an order of magnitude. Consequently, we are modeling
a thermally dominated state with a weak hard tail (for a

review on X-ray binaries states and radiative processes, see
Zdziarski & Gierli´nski 2004).

We keep constant the following parameters: z = 10 M ,
α = 0.7, hνlamp,1 = 2 eV and hνlamp,2 = 105 eV. All these
ﬁxed parameters are also given in Table 1. In particular,
we will not vary the lamp height z although this parame-
ter has an important impact on the illumination (see e.g.
Dauser et al. 2013). Our goal here is not to scan the full
parameter space but rather to determine the eﬀect of the
spin parameter on the reﬂected spectrum in a setup where
the lamp is suﬃciently close to the black hole to lead to
non-negligible light-bending eﬀects.

The resulting mean intensities in cgs units, consider-
ing Newtonian, Schwarzschild and close-to-extreme Kerr
spacetimes are presented in Fig. 2, right panel. This Figure

The agreement is within ≈ 0.2%. We note that even at large
distances, the illuminating relativistic mean intensities dif-
fer (by roughly 25 %) from the Newtonian ones. This can
be understood by noticing that even when the Keplerian
observer is at a large distance, the illuminating radiation is
always emitted in the strong gravitational ﬁeld region and
thus always contains a relativistic signature.

At this stage, we are ready to compute the reﬂected
spectrum due to the reprocessing of the lamp radiation by
the disk. We will consider an illuminating mean intensity as
computed in a Newtonian spacetime, or in a Kerr spacetime
with spin parameter a = 0 or a = 0.98.

3. Reﬂected spectra

3.1. Local spectra

Local spectra are computed using the radiative transfer
code ATM21 as described in R´o˙za´nska et al. (2011). We
refer to this paper, as well as to Madej & R´o˙za´nska (2004)
and R´o˙za´nska & Madej (2008), for more details and will
give here only the most important steps. We stress that
ATM21 computes simultaneously the structure of an ir-
radiated atmosphere and its outgoing line and continuum
spectrum, the atmosphere being both in hydrostatic and
radiative equilibrium.

Our radiative transfer equation assumes a plane-parallel

geometry and reads

µ

dIν
dτν

= Iν −

jν

κν + σν

(10)

where µ = cos i is the cosine of the angle between the
light ray and the local normal, jν is the emissivity, κν
is the opacity, σν is the scattering coeﬃcient, and dτν =
−(κν + σν)ρ dz, where ρ is the mass density, is the optical
depth. Emissivity takes into account the disk thermal emis-
sion, Compton scattering redistribution functions and iron
ﬂuorescence lines from the gas at each ionization state.

In our numerical procedure, the equation above is solved
with the structure of the gas kept in radiative, hydrostatic
and ionization equilibrium. We use local thermal equilib-
rium (LTE) absorption κν, whereas coeﬃcients of emission
jν and scattering σν include non-LTE terms. The coeﬃ-
cient of true absorption considers photoionization from nu-
merous levels of atoms and ions as well as Bremsstrahlung
(free-free) absorption from all ions.

The external

illumination by X-ray photons is fully
taken into account as an additional intensity ﬁeld which
enters the atmosphere from above. This energy-dependent
radiation modiﬁes the temperature and the gas ionization
level in addition to the disk thermal radiation generated
below the atmosphere via viscosity mechanism.

Both radiation intensities are scattered by Compton
process, which is included in the radiative transfer equa-
tion using angle-averaged Compton redistribution func-
tions (after Pomraning 1973; Guilbert 1981; Kershaw 1987).
Compton scattering cross-sections were computed following
the paper by Guilbert (1981), corrected for computational
errors in the original paper (see Madej et al. 2016), and
for the ﬁrst time presented in a computer code by Madej
(1989). Our equations and the Compton redistribution
functions work correctly in cases of both large and small
energy exchange between X-ray photons and free electrons
at the time of scattering. They ensure accurate solution of
the radiative transfer also in cases when the initial photon
energy before or after scattering exceeds the electron rest
mass (mec2 = 511 keV).

We highlight that we compute the full reﬂected spectra,
meaning that we take into account both the thermal compo-
nent emitted by the accretion disk at the local temperature
and the reﬂected part due to the reprocessing of the light
emitted by the lamp. Therefore, the disk emission and X-
ray illumination always self-consistently inﬂuence the mat-
ter thermal and ionization structure. As a result, the out-
going local spectrum contains all reprocessing signatures,
such as: the deviation of the thermal spectrum from pure
blackbody due to photo-absorption and re-emission, the
deviation of the spectrum due to photon energy shift by
Compton scattering, the Compton hump due to the reﬂec-
tion from the heated atmosphere (both eﬀects are presented
in Madej & R´o˙za´nska 2000), and the ﬂuorescent iron line
complex (R´o˙za´nska & Madej 2008; R´o˙za´nska et al. 2011).

3.1.1. Computing local spectra

We model the accretion disk by a stationary relativistic
slim disk solution (S¸adowski et al. 2011), which depends on
the black hole mass and assumed accretion rate, assumed
here to be: M = 10 M(cid:12) and ˙m = 0.01 ˙mEdd. This allows
to compute the vertical gravity and eﬀective temperature
radial distributions that are input parameters of our ra-
diative transfer computations. These quantities depend on
the spin parameter, which is thus taken into account self-
consistently. From those quantities, the radiative transfer is
solved for a set of discretized radii, assuming that the disk
has solar-like chemical abundances. At each radius, vertical
gravity and eﬀective temperature are only needed to formu-
late the boundary conditions of the vertical atmosphere’s
structure. Subsequent iterations proceed between the ra-
diation ﬁeld and the gas structure, as it should be when
solving radiation transfer problem. For the atmosphere, we
assume hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium, which adds
an additional diﬀerential equation to the whole problem,
making the derivation of the solution much more complex
and time consuming than in the case of a constant-density
gas (as done in Garc´ıa et al. 2014).

ural widths are set respectively to 2.7 eV, 3.3 eV and
2.5 eV. The boundary condition of the radiative transfer
equation is set by the illumination mean intensity proﬁle
computed in Section 2 which gives the value of the mean
intensity for all radii and the associated direction cosine
µillum. Deep in the disk atmosphere, we assume full ther-
malization. Nevertheless, in our scheme when iterating be-
tween the gas structure and the radiation ﬁeld at each point
of the atmosphere, including the deepest one, temperature
corrections are taken into account.
The radiative transfer equation is solved for a set of ≈ 30
radial points, 8 directional cosines µ between 0.02 and 0.98
and for ≈ 2600 values of photon energy between 2 eV and
105 eV. The precise deﬁnition of the grids considered for the
two spin values we take into account is given in Table 2. The
output of this Section is the value of the reprocessed speciﬁc
intensity I repro
as a function of the 8 direction cosines µ
and of the ≈ 2600 photon energies, for all values of radii
in the disk where the radiative transfer is solved. This ﬁnal
reprocessed intensity consists in both the thermal emission
from the cold accretion disk and the mixture of absorbed
and then re-emited radiation, either by true absorption or
scattering, outgoing from the hot skin.

3.1.2. Dependence on illumination computation, spin and

direction

Fig. 3 illustrates the eﬀect of changing the computation of
the illumination (Newtonian or GR) and the value of spin
on the local spectrum. As illustrated in the upper left panel,
the spectrum is made of three parts:
– the thermal bump (around 100 eV − 1 keV) is due to
two forms of dissipation: viscous dissipation in the ac-
cretion disk and heating by the irradiation of the lamp.
However for our choice of parameter, the viscous heating
is dominating (see the end of Section 2);

– the iron-line complex due to ﬂuorescent emission

(around 6.4 keV);

– and the Compton hump (at energies just above the iron-
line complex) due to the Compton back scattering of
hard photons.

The thermal part of the spectrum will be less aﬀected
by changing the illumination as part of it is computed
from the hydrostatic equilibrium temperature of the ac-
cretion disk which only slightly depends on illumination.

6

The reﬂected part of the spectrum (iron-line complex plus
Compton hump) depends on the illumination proﬁle con-
sidered. At small radii, the reﬂected spectrum is stronger
for GR illumination, while at bigger radii, the opposite is
true and the Newtonian illumination leads to a stronger re-
ﬂected spectrum. This is in perfect agreement with Fig. 2,
right panel, which shows that the Newtonian illumination
dominates the general-relativistic one at big radii, while it
is smaller at small radii, because of light bending eﬀect.
Fig. 4 shows the relative diﬀerence R between the local
spectra computed with a Newtonian or GR illumination,
at the inner disk radius (where most of the radiation is
emitted). It is computed following

R = 200

spectrum GR − spectrum Newton

.

(11)

Fig. 3 also shows the inﬂuence of the spin parameter on
the local spectrum. Higher spin leads to higher disk tem-
perature (see Fig. 1 of R´o˙za´nska et al. 2011), particularly
at smaller radii (the spin dependence decreases to zero
as r increases). As a consequence, at r = 7M , the ther-
mal bump peaks higher and so does the Compton hump
as Comptonization is depending on the disk temperature.
At r = 120M the spectra are very similar for a = 0 and
a = 0.98, as they should be. The thermal bump for spin
a = 0.98 deviates from blackbody radiation since for the
inner regions the disk eﬀective temperature is high. Such
an atmosphere is made of an almost completely ionized gas
allowing for eﬃcient Compton scattering. This modiﬁes the
high energy tail and the frequency of peak ﬂux of thermal
radiation as demonstrated in Madej (1991). The outgoing
spectrum is sensitive to the local vertical temperature and
ionization structure. Therefore, spectra emerging from the
outer radii at r=120 M for both spins may sligthly diﬀer,
since reprocessing depends on many aspects like the ex-
act illumination ﬁeld and the detailed vertical structure.
The appearance of spectral features also depends on local
thermodynamical conditions. If the external illumination is
low in comparison to the disk temperature, we clearly see
ionization edges in absorption. But when the illumination
increases, many spectral features start to be visible in emis-
sion as shown by Madej & R´o˙za´nska (2000). When matter
is completely ionized we do not see any spectral features
in the reﬂected part of the spectrum. Finally, if the inner
disk temperature is high enough, thermal radiation modi-
ﬁed by Compton scattering covers the iron line region, and
this feature is only visible as the resonant line in absorp-
tion from the hot atmosphere (R´o˙za´nska et al. 2011). This
result clearly shows that properly computed disk thermal
component should be taken into account in the models used
for spin ﬁtting from iron line shape in black hole binaries.
Fig. 5 illustrates the dependence on the direction of the
local spectrum. For both spins, edge-on (cos i = 0.02) emis-
sion is smaller in the thermal bump but higher in the re-
ﬂected part of the spectrum. This is of course in agreement
with the discussion in R´o˙za´nska et al. (2011) as we are using
the same model (but using a denser radial grid), with only
a diﬀering illumination. It is interesting to note two more
things. First, for both spins, the reﬂected part of the spec-
trum is more and more depending on direction as the radius
gets bigger. Second, at small radii, the reﬂected spectrum
is much less dependent on direction for higher spin than
for lower spin. This is because the gas on innermost rings
is hot itself and the thermal spectrum covers ﬂat part of

considered, cos i = 0.98 (almost face-on, i.e. close to the normal to the disk). The illumination is computed in general

spectrum which does not depend much on the direction.

3.2. Ray tracing observed spectra

At this point we are ready to start the third and last step
of our numerical pipeline, which is the ray tracing of the
reﬂected spectrum to a distant observer.

The main aim of this section is to analyze the impor-
tance of taking into account the directional dependence (as
a function of µ) of the local spectrum in order to compute
observed spectra. We note that we will often use in this sec-

tion the expression observed spectrum having in mind the
reprocessed (thermal+reﬂected) spectrum ray traced to in-
ﬁnity. The direct component is shown separately to brieﬂy
discuss the relative strength of the reprocessed/direct com-
ponents, but we mainly focus in the following on the re-
processed part. This is the same analysis as already done
by Garc´ıa et al. (2014), but with the important distinc-
tion of using a very diﬀerent code for computing the local
spectrum.

computed knowing the 4-velocity of the emitting gas u, the
4-vector tangent to the emitted photon geodesic p and the
local disk normal 4-vector n

Fig. 6 shows the distribution of the emission angle i (such
as µ = cos i) in a disk surrounding an extreme Kerr black
hole seen under two diﬀerent inclinations, θ = 5◦ and
θ = 85◦. Strong bending of light rays in the central region
of spacetime leads to a large set of emission angles being
present for one given value of the inclination θ, in contrast
to a Newtonian spacetime for which i = θ. From this Figure
only it is clear that considering an emission-angle-averaged
or a directional emission may lead to very diﬀerent observed
spectra. It is the aim of this Section to investigate this ques-
tion, following the previous analysis by Garc´ıa et al. (2014).
Fig. 7 illustrates the various angles used in our analy-
sis and deﬁnes in more detail the notion of angle-averaged
ray-traced spectrum. When a backwards-in-time ray-traced
photon hits the disk, and after having computed the emit-
ted frequency ν and the direction cosine µ, the speciﬁc in-
tensity I repro
(r, µ, ν) is trilinearly interpolated (i.e. linearly
in all 3 dimensions) from the results of Section 3.1. For com-
puting an angle-averaged spectrum, this quantity is simply
averaged over the direction cosine µ

Thus a map of speciﬁc intensity in the observer’s frame (i.e.
an image of the disk) can be computed, which is readily
transformed to a ﬂux value by summing over all directions
on sky. The observed spectrum is thus at hand.

Fig. 8 shows the angle-averaged and directional ray-
traced spectra for both spins, together with their relative
diﬀerence. This Figure also shows the level of the direct-
component power law, directly reaching the observer from
the lamp. This component was computed by ray tracing
the lamp alone, as observed by the distant observer, and
keeping the same normalization of the emitted intensity as
described in Section 2. It shows that our choice of param-
eters leads to a total spectrum dominated by the direct
and thermal components. Fig. 8 also shows the relative
diﬀerence between the directional and angle-averaged lo-
cal (non-ray-traced) spectra, computed for both spins at
r = rmin. This Figure shows a few important things. As we
will discuss this quantity a lot, let us call R the relative
diﬀerence between angle-averaged and directional spectra,
which is computed in the same way as in Eq. 11. First,
R can go as high as ≈ 70%, and in particular in the re-
gion of the iron-line complex it is of the order of 50%. This
maximum value of R is the same for local and ray-traced
spectra. The general behavior of R is rather similar for lo-
cal and ray-traced spectra. However, there is an important
diﬀerence: the edge-on value of R is always signiﬁcantly
smaller than its face-on value for ray-traced spectra (partic-
ularly at high spin), while for local spectra the diﬀerence is
less pronounced. This means that edge-on ray-traced spec-
tra are closer to the angle-averaged spectra than face-on
ray-traced spectra. This fact can be understood as follows.

the black-hole spin axis and the line of sight, and the emission angle i between the disk normal and the direction of
emission of the photon in the emitter’s frame. Center and Right: these maps show a map of the values of the emission
angle i between the local normal to the accretion disk and the direction of photon emission for a spin of a = 0.98. The
inclination angle is equal θ = 5◦ (center) or θ = 85◦ (right). The right panel can be compared to Fig. 5, lower left panel
of Garc´ıa et al. (2014).

Fig. 7. Illustrating the angle dependence of ray-traced spectra. Ray-traced spectra in this article are computed from two
inclination angles, θ = 5◦ (face-on observer) or θ = 85◦ (edge-on observer). From each of this inclination angles, photons
are ray traced backwards to the accretion disk (blue lines). For one given inclination θ, photons reach the disk with a
set of diﬀerent directions because of light bending. This is illustrated in the Figure by the fact that one given blue line
is connected to a set of diﬀerent directions of local emission in the disk (black arrows, the black vertical dashed line
being the local normal). This means that the face-on observer, e.g., sees photons emitted not only at face-on emission
but also in all other emission directions. Directional ray-traced spectra are computed by transporting along each geodesic
the speciﬁc intensity Iν(r, i) emitted at the local position r in the direction i of this particular geodesic. Angle-averaged
ray-traced spectra are computed by transporting along each geodesic the angle-averaged speciﬁc intensity Iν(r) obtained
by averaging Iν(r, i) over all emission angles i.

Fig. 9 shows the observed speciﬁc intensity distribution as
a function of the direction cosine µ, for both spins. It shows
that photons forming the face-on ray-traced spectrum are
emitted in a narrower range of values of µ than their edge-
on counterparts. This eﬀect gets stronger with increasing
spin: for a = 0.98, photons forming the edge-on ray-traced
spectrum are coming from a very broad range of values of
µ. This explains why edge-on ray-traced spectra are closer
to the angle-averaged solution, and even more at higher
spins. The strong dependence on the spin parameter of this
eﬀect is explained in Fig. 10. This Figure shows that the
very strong relativistic beaming eﬀect at high spin has for
consequence that most of the ﬂux is emitted from the very

inner parts of the disk, where the emission angle i varies
a lot (see Fig. 6, right panel). Thus, all possible values of
emission angle contribute and the ﬁnal spectrum is closer
to the averaged solution.

As far as the emission-angle-dependence of the spec-
tra are concerned, our results are in reasonable agreement
with the ﬁndings of Garc´ıa et al. (2014). Our Fig. 9, right
panel, can be compared to Fig. 8, upper-right and lower-
right panels of Garc´ıa et al. (2014), which are similar. This
shows once again that the ray-tracing part of the computa-
tion is very similar in both works. It is more complicated to
go into a detailed comparison of the observed spectra and
their dependence on the emission angle i. Our Fig. 8 is dif-

ferent from the left panels of Fig. 8 of Garc´ıa et al. (2014),
and this is obviously due to the diﬀerences in the computa-
tion of local spectra. Garc´ıa et al. (2014) ﬁnd a maximum
diﬀerence between directional and angle-averaged spectra
of (cid:38) 20% (taking into account their results for z = 10 M
only of course), while we ﬁnd a maximum diﬀerence of up
to 50%. It is not possible to go further in the comparison
without doing a complete code comparison, which is not
the aim of this paper. Still, the conclusions of both com-
pletely independent treatments are reasonably similar, as
far as the angle dependence of the spectra is concerned.

The upper-right panel of Fig. 8 shows no iron line for
a = 0.98, neither in emission nor in absorption. This was
already noticeable in the upper middle and right panels of
Fig. 5 showing the local spectra that exhibit very narrow

absorption lines due to the fact that the thermal bump cov-
ers the iron-line complex. The relativistic blurring of these
narrow lines has for consequence to completely remove the
line from the observed spectrum. However, the fact that
the thermal bump covers the iron-line complex is due to
our choice of parameters for which the illumination lumi-
nosity is dominated by the accretion-induced luminosity.
We have checked that for a much smaller accretion rate
( ˙m = 10−5 mEdd ; with the same illumination) the local
spectrum at spin 0.98 has a less prominent thermal bump
leading to a clear iron line in emission, similarly to the
a = 0 case depicted in Fig. 5. This fact shows that a de-
tailed study of the observed iron-line complex as a function
of the ratio of the illuminating to accretion-induced lumi-
nosities would be very interesting. Such an analysis goes

beyond the scope of the present paper and we will present
it in a future article.

The conclusion of this Section is that it is very impor-
tant to take into account the directionality of the emitted,
local spectrum in order to predict the iron-line complex of
the observed spectrum. Indeed, the error on the observed
spectrum caused by angle averaging is as high as 50% in
the iron line region.

4. Conclusion

The aim of this article is to compute X-ray spectra repro-
cessed by the accretion disk of an X-ray binary in a very
realistic way. We consider the isotropic emission of X-rays
from a nearly point-like lamp at rest at z = 10 M along the
black hole axis. We have computed in full general relativ-
ity the irradiation onto the accretion disk for two extreme
values of the spin parameter a = 0 and a = 0.98. We then
compute the local spectra reprocessed by the accretion disk,
taking self-consistently into account the black spin by solv-

ing the hydrostatic equilibrium of the disk together with
the radiative transfer. Finally we ray trace this local spec-
trum to a distant observer in order predict a very realistic
observed spectrum.

We show that taking into account the angle dependence
of the local spectra is very important for obtaining an ac-
curate observed spectrum. In particular, the inﬂuence of
averaging out the angular information of the local spectra
leads to an error in the observed spectrum of 50% in the
iron-line region, which is the important region to constrain
black hole spins.

We also show that, for the set of parameters chosen
in this work, the disk thermal emission is strong enough
to cover the iron line complex for spin a = 0.98, re-
sulting in a featureless reﬂected spectrum. On the other
hand, the direct component is much higher than the re-
ﬂected one at a=0. Thus, for both spins, the observed (di-
rect+thermal+reﬂected) spectrum contains only weak re-
ﬂection features.

We intend to devote future work to investigating in de-
tail the appearance of the observed spectrum in various
X-ray binary states (thermal dominated and hard state)
for a set of diﬀerent lamp altitudes (which has a strong
impact on the reprocessed/direct components ratio). This
will allow us to determine what sets of parameters allow to
generate reﬂection-dominated spectra for diﬀerent source
spectral states.
