ABSTRACT

We present an analysis of four epochs of Hα and [S II] λλ 6716/6731 HST
images of HH 1. For determining proper motions we explore a new method
based on analysis of spatially degraded images obtained convolving the images
with wavelet functions of chosen widths. With this procedure we are able to
generate maps of proper motion velocities along and across the outﬂow axis, as
well as (angularly integrated) proper motion velocity distributions. From the
four available epochs, we ﬁnd the time evolution of the velocities, intensities and
spatial distribution of the line emission. We ﬁnd that over the last two decades
HH 1 shows a clear acceleration. Also, the Hα and [S II] intensities have ﬁrst
dropped, and then recovered in the more recent (2014) images. Finally, we show
a comparison between the two available HST epochs of [O III] λ 5007 (1994 and
2014), in which we see a clear drop in the value of the [O III]/Hα ratio.

Introduction

The presence of high proper motions is one of the principal characteristics of Herbig-
Haro (HH) objects, and were observed in some HH objects even before they were identiﬁed
as such (for example, in HH 29, see Luyten 1963 and Cudworth & Herbig 1979). The
importance of proper motion measurements was highlighted by the study of a time series of
plates of HH 1 and 2 by Herbig & Jones (1981), showing that the two objects form part of a

single, bipolar outﬂow (see the discussion of the history of HH 1/2 proper motions of Raga
et al. 2011).

An important issue about the proper motions of HH objects is the question of whether
or not they represent actual mass motions. George Herbig initially thought that these mo-
tions might represent changes in the relative brightnesses of regions within concentrations
of HH knots, but in seeing the large displacements that were measured, he rapidly became
convinced that HH objects indeed had clear, substantial motions in the plane of the sky
(Kyle Cudworth, personal communication). Jones & Herbig put together from their plates
(described in their 1981 paper) an “animation” of the motions of HH 1 and 2, which con-
vincingly show systematic, organized motions away from a central source.

The proper motions of HH objects are closely related to the variability of their emission.
Few studies of the variability of the emission line spectra of HH objects have been made,
because while the proper motions can be measured over time-periods of a few years, the
variability of the emission typically takes place over decades. The optical time-variability of
HH 1 and 2 has been studied by Herbig (1968, 1973) and Eisl¨oﬀel et al. (1994), and the
UV time-variability has been described by Brugel et al. (1985). One of the few studies of
variability in other HH objects is the one of HH 29 by Liseau et al. (1996).

While the older studies of proper motions of HH objects utilized photographic plates,
more recent measurements use CCD images (the ﬁrst eﬀort in this direction being the study
of HH 1 and 2 by Raga et al. 1990a). The proper motions of HH knots from CCD images
can be obtained from ﬁts to intensity peaks (which requires an identiﬁcation of pairs of peaks
in diﬀerent epochs, see, e.g., Eisl¨oﬀel et al. 1994).

It is also possible to deﬁne “boxes” or “apertures” (i.e., angularly limited ﬁelds within
the images) used to calculate cross-correlation functions between pairs of images. The oﬀsets
associated with the peak of the cross-correlation function give the value of the proper motion
of the emission within the chosen boxes. This method was ﬁrst used in the context of HH
objects by Heathcote & Reipurth (1992). The cross-correlation method has the advantage
of giving proper motions associated to possibly well deﬁned, larger features in HH objects,
and is less sensitive to changes in the detailed, small scale morphology of the ﬂows.

In this paper, we use a new method for determining proper motions in HH objects:

• We ﬁrst convolve the images of the successive epochs with a wavelet of half-width σ

(with σ ≥ 1 pixel),

• In successive pairs of convolved images we identify neighbouring intensity peaks, and

determine the proper motions from the resulting oﬀsets.

– 3 –

This method has features in common with both the “peak ﬁtting” method (indeed, it is
a peak ﬁtting method, but using angularly degraded images) and the “cross correlation”
method (as it includes spatial smoothing). The spatial smoothing feature is convenient
for proper motion measurements of extended structures (see the discussion above), and the
smoothing is obtained without having to manually choose arbitrary “cross correlation boxes”.

We carry out a ﬁrst application of this method to 4 epochs of Hα and [S II] λλ 6716/6731
HST images of the HH 1/2 system, in particular focussing on the time-evolution of HH 1.
This data set is described in section 2. In section 3, we present the proper motions derived
from cross correlations of the brighter regions of HH 1. In section 4, we present the proper
motions of individual condensations of HH 1 obtained with the new “wavelet proper motion”
method. In section 5, we derive “proper motion velocity distributions” (as a function of the
velocities along and perpendicular to the outﬂow axis) from the “wavelet proper motions”,
and also the variability of the line intensities and the morphology of HH 1 as a whole. Section
6 presents a qualitative comparison of the two available [O III] λ 5007 HST images of HH 1.
Finally, the results are discussed in section 7.

2. The data set

Four epochs of images of the HH 1/2 outﬂow are now available in the HST archive (see

Table 1). The successive observations have been described in a series of papers:

• epoch 1: Hester et al. (1998),
• epoch 2: Bally et al. (2002),
• epoch 3: Hartigan et al. (2011),
• epoch 4: Raga et al. (2015a, b).

The ﬁrst three epochs were obtained with the WFCP2 camera, and the fourth epoch with
the WFC3 camera. The paper of Bally et al. (2002) presents proper motions obtained with
the two ﬁrst epochs, and the paper of Hartigan et al. (2011) discusses the morphological
changes seen in the ﬁrst three epochs. Using the only two stars present in the frames, namely
the Cohen-Schwartz star (Cohen & Schwartz 1979) and “star no. 4” of Strom et al. (1985)
we have centered, rotated and scaled all of the images, producing a set of aligned frames
with 0.1 arcsec per pixel.

We obtain the ﬂuxes of the individual pixels of the archival WFPC2 images by multi-
plying the “data numbers” (DNs) by a calibration constant C=BANDWID×PHOTFLAM

– 4 –

(with the values given by the corresponding keywords in the ﬁts ﬁles). We obtain C =
1.14 × 10−15, 4.51 × 10−16 and 3.99 × 10−16 erg s−1 cm−2, for the F502N, F656N and F673N
ﬁlters, respectively (see Table 1). Dudziak & Walsh (1997) obtain calibration constants
CDW = 1.15 × 10−14 and 4.08 × 10−15 erg s−1 cm−2, for the F502N and F656N ﬁlters (they
did not use the F673N) ﬁlter), which diﬀer from our values by a factor of almost one order of
magnitude. We assume that this is due to a typo in the paper of Dudziak & Walsh (1997).

We obtain the ﬂuxes of the WFC3 images using a calibration constant C = ∆λ×PHOTFLAM

(with the PHOTFLAM values given in the header of the ﬁts ﬁles, and the ∆λ “rectangular
width” values given in the WFC3 Instrument Handbook). We obtain C = 3.42 × 10−16,
2.94 × 10−16 and 2.64 × 10−16 erg s−1 cm−2, for the F502N, F656N and F673N ﬁlters, re-
spectively (see Table 1). Once allowance has been made for the angular size of the WFC3
pixels, these calibration constants are found to be in good agreement with the values derived
by O’Dell et al. (2013). We ﬁnally bin the WFC3 images to the 0.1 arcsec pixel size of the
WFPC2.

In the F656N (Hα) ﬁlter, the [N II] λ 6548 line is present at ∼ 5% of the peak trans-
mission (see the discussion of O’Dell et al. 2013). Given the relatively low [N II] 6548/Hα
ratios observed in HH 1 and 2 (see, e.g., Brugel et al. 1981a), the contribution of the [N II]
emission to the F656N frames is likely to be only ∼ 2% . The continuum emission of HH 1
and 2 (Brugel et al. 1981b) probably also has only a small contribution to the ﬂux of the
HST images (see the discussion of Raga et al. 2015b).

3. The Hα and [S II] proper motions of HH 1

We use the Hα and [S II] images of the four epochs (see Figure 1) to obtain the proper
motions of the emitting region of HH 1. We ﬁrst carry out cross correlations between the
three possible pairs of consecutive images (of each emission line) in order to determine the
time-dependence of the proper motions of HH 1.

We ﬁrst carry out cross correlations over the ﬁeld shown in the bottom right frame
of Figure 1. This ﬁeld includes the brighter region of the head of HH 1. From the three
successive pairs of images, we determine three proper motions for Hα and for [S II]. We then
project the measured proper motions along and across the outﬂow axis of the HH 1/2 system
(for which adopt the PA=325◦ orientation of the HH1 jet, see Bally et al. 2002). Assuming
a distance of 414 pc, we then calculate the velocities parallel (v(cid:107)) and perpendicular (v⊥)
to the outﬂow axis for the three pairs of images. The results of this exercise are shown in
Figure 2. Actually, very similar results are obtained if one carries out cross correlations over

– 5 –

the whole ﬁeld shown in Figure 1 (which is a direct result of the fact that the head of HH 1
has a dominant contribution to the emission of the object).

(cid:113)

In Figure 2, we show the proper motion velocities along (v(cid:107)) and across (v⊥) the outﬂow

axis (with negative values of v⊥ directed to the SW), as well as the modulus vT =
We can see the following features:

• it is clear that v⊥ has relatively small values, so that we always have vT ≈ v(cid:107),
• v(cid:107) (and also vT ) shows a monotonic growth as a function of time, with an increase from

≈ 250 to 300 km s−1 during the ≈ 20 yr time-span of the observations,

• v⊥ has moduli < 100 km s−1, and has alternating negative and positive values (though

with considerably larger excursions in the SW, negative direction).

4. The proper motions of individual condensations

It is not straightforward to measure proper motions of individual features in images of
HH objects spanning many years. This is particularly true of high resolution HST images, in
which identiﬁable features have clearly visible morphological changes (see, e.g., the evolution
of the head of HH 1 in the frames shown in Figure 1). Because of this, it has been standard
practice to deﬁne arbitrary “cross-correlation boxes” (i.e., limited ﬁelds over which cross
correlations between pairs of images are carried out), from which proper motions are deter-
mined (corresponding to the shift of the cross-correlation function). This method has the
attractive feature that the implicit spatial smoothing (from carrying out a cross-correlation
over a relatively large-sized ﬁeld) gives a proper motion which is not sensitive to the small
spatial scale morphological time-variations. However, it has the undesirable feature that the
measured proper motions are dependent on the somewhat arbitrarily chosen cross-correlation
boxes.

Alternatively, it is possible to evenly divide images into boxes (or “tiles”, see Szyszka
et al. 2011) of a ﬁxed size, and to carry out cross correlations within these boxes (in pairs
of successive images). This was ﬁrst tried for HH objects by Raga et al. (2012).

In this paper we try a new method for determining proper motions:

• we ﬁrst degrade the resolution of the original images (through a convolution with a

smoothing function),

– 6 –

• we then measure the shifts in the identiﬁable intensity peaks between pairs of spatially
smoothed images. These shifts are measured through direct, paraboloidal ﬁts to the
intensity peaks in the images.

This method shares the spatial smoothing feature of the cross-correlation method, and gives
results which are not dependent on arbitrary choices of “boxes”. However, the obtained
proper motions are indeed dependent on the width (σ, see below) of the smoothing function.

For the smoothing function we choose a “Mexican hat” wavelet of half-width σ:

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

gσ(x, y) =

1
πσ2

1 − x2 + y2

σ2

e−(x2+y2)/σ2 ,

(1)

with which we convolve the observed frames (x and y are the coordinates in pixels on the
plane of the image). The convolved images Iσ are then calculated through the usual integral

Iσ(x, y) =

I(x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) gσ(x − x(cid:48), y − y(cid:48)) dx(cid:48)dy(cid:48) ,

(2)

(cid:90) (cid:90)

where I(x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) is the original (i.e., not convolved) image, and the convolution integral is
carried out over the whole domain with a standard, “Fast Fourier Transform” method.

We have chosen two wavelets, with σ = 3 and 5 pixels (0.3 and 0.5 arcsec, respectively),
and the results of the convolutions of the Hα images with these functions are shown in
Figures 3 and 4.

The Hα images convolved with the σ = 3 wavelet (see Figure 3) show a number of

peaks. We have made a search for peaks which satisfy the following criteria:

• intensities with values greater than Ip = 1.5× 10−15 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2. This value
was chosen so that the main, identiﬁable knots are included, while rejecting fainter
peaks that appear to be associated with noise,

• centers with an individual pixel which has larger ﬂuxes than all of the neighbouring

pixels (including diagonal neighbours).

In this way we eliminate “ridges” as well as low intensity maxima. The peaks that are
identiﬁed (and ﬁtted) in the convolutions of the four Hα frames with the σ = 3 wavelet are
shown in Figure 3. Errors in the positions of the peaks (resulting from the ﬁtting procedure
and the centering of the images) are of the order of ∼ 0.2 pix.

We search for peaks in the pairs of consecutive images as follows. For the three possible
pairs of consecutive images (1994-1997, 1997-2007 and 2007-2014, see Table 2 and Figures

– 7 –

1 and 3) we take the position of the peaks in the earlier image, and search (in the NW
quadrant only) for corresponding peaks in the latter image of the pair. This search is made
only to a maximum distance dmax, which we have set to 10 pixels for the 1994-1997 image
pair, to 30 pixels for 1997-2007 and 20 pixels for 2007-2014 (corresponding to a maximum
proper motion velocity of ≈ 600 km s−3 for the three image pairs). It is then necessary to
check “manually” that the knot pairs chosen by the algorithm actually correspond to knot
pairs that appear to be the same physical feature. In this way, for each pair of images we
obtain shifts for the identiﬁed knot pairs.

With the above knot detection algorithm, in the four consecutive epochs (of Hα images
convolved with a σ = 3 pix wavelet) we detect 17, 14, 14 and 17 knots, respectively. We
choose 11, 5 and 14 knot pairs in the successive three pairs of epochs. The lower number
of pairs chosen for the second (1997.58 → 2007.63) pair of epochs is due to the larger
morphological changes that occur in this longer time-interval.

The bottom frame of Figure 3 shows the shifts of identiﬁed knot pairs in the 1994-1997
images (red arrows), the 1997-2007 images (blue arrows) and in the 2007-2014 images (purple
arrows). We also show one arrow (in cyan) that corresponds to the shift between leading
NW intensity peak of the 2014.63 frame and the closest peak to the SE found in the 2007
frame. This shift therefore corresponds to a “backwards in time” search for a companion
knot in the 2007-2014 frame pair.

In Figure 4, we show the convolutions of the Hα frames with a broader, σ = 5 pixel
(0(cid:48)(cid:48).5) wavelet. These convolutions clearly show a smaller number of intensity peaks, with
a less chaotic distribution in the faint, SW region of HH 1. In these maps we ﬁnd all of
the peaks with central intensities larger than Ip = 3.0 × 10−16 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2, and
identify common knots in the pairs of successive frames (see the discussion above). The
oﬀsets between the common knots in the three successive pairs of images are shown in
the bottom frame of Figure 4. In the bottom frame of this ﬁgure, the black arrow of the
westernmost knot corresponds to the oﬀset between the 1997.58 and 2014.63 frames, because
this region lies outside of the “HST footprint” in the 2007.63 frames.

We now take the knot oﬀsets measured in the images convolved with the σ = 3 wavelet
(shown in the bottom frame of Figure 3) together with the oﬀsets measured in the σ = 5
convolutions (see Figure 4) in the S and SW region of HH 1 (which are not seen well in the
higher resolution maps) to produce proper motion velocities for the 1994-1997, 1997-2007
and 2007-2014 pairs of epochs. The results are shown in Figure 5 as maps of the velocities
parallel and perpendicular to the outﬂow axis.

These maps are generated as follows. For each pixel in the map we make a search for all

– 8 –

of the knots with measured proper motions within a radius rmax (for each of the knot pairs,
we use the mean knot position of the two consecutive epochs). We then compute the velocity
corresponding to the pixel of the map as an average of the velocities of the neighbouring
knots, with weights w = rmax − r, where r is the distance from the knot to the pixel under
consideration.

The Hα proper motions along the outﬂow axis for the three pairs of epochs (left column
of Figure 5) all show larger velocities along a central “high velocity channel” (as previously
reported by Bally et al. 2002 from an analysis of the 1994 and 1997 frames), surrounded
with lower velocity regions to the W and E. Further W, there is a higher velocity region
(corresponding to the faint ﬁlament seen in the W region of the Hα frames, see Figure 1).
It is clear that there is a general trend of growing axial velocities as a function of time, with
a rather dramatic velocity increase in 2007-2014 at the leading, NW edge of HH 1.

The velocities across the outﬂow axis (right hand column of Figure 5) show a general
expansion away from the axis (with more positive velocities to the NE, and more negative
values to the W). Also, in the 1997-2007 proper motions we see more eastwardly directed
velocities than in the other two pairs of epochs. Therefore, the results obtained from the
proper motions of individual condensations of HH 1 are broadly consistent with the proper
motions of HH 1 as a whole (see the previous section and Figure 2).

We convolved the four [S II] images with a σ = 3 wavelet (see above), and identiﬁed
knot positions and knot pairs in successive frames (with the same criteria that we used for
the σ = 3 Hα convolutions, see above). The [S II] knot positions and oﬀsets are shown in
Figure 6, and the resulting velocity maps (of velocities parallel and perpendicular to the
outﬂow axis) are shown in Figure 7. We have not used the results obtained from σ = 5
pix wavelet convolutions of the [S II] images (as we have done for the case of the Hα maps,
see Figure 4) because they show basically the same structures that are seen in the higher
resolution, σ = 3 convolutions.

The high axial velocity, central channel is less clear in the [S II] (Figure 7) than in the
Hα (Figure 5) axial velocity maps. Also, the high velocity structure at the tip of HH 1 (see
the 2007-2011 Hα axial velocity map in Figure 5) is not seen in [S II]. This is a direct result
of the fact that the protrusion seen in the 2014 Hα frame (bottom left frame of Figure 1)
has very weak [S II] emission, and does not produce a separate peak in the convolution of
the [S II] frame with the σ = 3 wavelet.

Except for these features, the Hα (Figure 5) and [S II] (Figure 7) velocity maps are
similar. The axial velocity maps show a trend of general acceleration. The velocities per-
pendicular to the axis show more negative values (directed to the SW) in the 1994-1997 and

– 9 –

2007-2011 maps, and more positive values in 1997-2007 for both emission lines. Finally, in
the Hα maps we seer higher axial velocities in the faint SE region in 2007-2014 (see the
bottom left frame of Figure 5).

5. Line intensities and proper motion velocity distributions

We have used the determinations of proper motions of individual condensations (seen
in maps convolved with Mexican Hat wavelets, see above) to obtain spatially integrated
velocity distributions. To do this, we have computed the ﬂuxes in velocity bins of widths
∆v = 60 km s−1 by adding the ﬂuxes of the knots with proper motion velocities (either
along or across the outﬂow axis) falling within each bin. The ﬂuxes of the individual knots
(seen in the convolutions with wavelets) are calculated as Fknot = πσ2Fpeak, where Fpeak is
the peak intensity of the knot, and σ is the half-width of the wavelet (see equation 1).

In this way we obtain Hα and [S II] distributions as a function of either the velocities
parallel (v(cid:107)) or perpendicular (v⊥) to the outﬂow axis. The distributions resulting from the
three pairs of consecutive epochs are shown in Figure 8.

The axial velocity Hα and [S II] velocity distributions (F vs. v(cid:107), left column of Figure
8) show a dominant, high velocity intensity peak in the 1994-1997 and 1997-2007 epoch pairs
at v(cid:107) ≈ 300 km s−1. The 2007-2014 axial velocity distribution (bottom left frame of Figure
8) is broader, extending to velocities of ∼ 500 km s−1.

The Hα and [S II] distributions of ﬂux versus velocity across the outﬂow axis v⊥ (right
column of Figure 8) resemble each other in the 1994-1997 and 2007-2014 epoch pairs, but
show substantial diﬀerences for 1997-2007. The 1997-2007 distributions show more ﬂux at
positive values of v⊥ (i.e., directed to the NE) than the other two pairs of epochs.

Table 2 gives the maximum and minimum values of v(cid:107) and v⊥ obtained (in both the Hα
or the [S II] knots) for each of the three pairs of epochs. From these values we calculate the
velocity ranges ∆v(cid:107) and ∆v⊥ for the three epoch pairs (see Table 2).

If we assume that the condensations of HH 1 take part in a single, broken-up bow shock
ﬂow, these results can be interpreted as follows. Raga et al. (1997) showed that the total
ranges of possible proper motion velocities along (∆v(cid:107)) and across (∆v⊥) the outﬂow axis in
a bow shock ﬂow are both equal to the velocity vbs of the bow shock relative to the pre-bow
shock environment. However, given that in a bow shock ﬂow one only has a ﬁnite number
of clumps, the observed ranges in proper motion velocities do not necessarily sample the full
possible velocity range. We therefore expect to have ∆v(cid:107), ∆v⊥ ≤ vbs. From Table 2, we then

– 10 –

see that the velocity ranges (along and across the outﬂow axis) of the 1994-1997 and 1997-
2007 pairs of epochs imply a lower boundary for the bow shock velocity vbs ∼ 350 km s−1,
while the 2007-2014 epoch pair implies a higher, vbs ≈ 500 km s−1 value.

We have also measured the Hα and [S II] ﬂuxes integrated over all of the emitting area
of HH 1 (over the 18 arcsec ﬁeld displayed in Figure 1). We have carried out a subtraction
of the background (even though this has only a minor eﬀect on the obtained ﬂuxes), and
obtained the Hα and [S II] ﬂuxes for the four epochs (see Table 2), which we show as a
function of time in Figure 9.

The [S II] ﬂux shows a decrease as a function of time until 2007, with a rate of ≈ 6%
per year in the 1994-1997 and 2007-2014 periods, and a smaller rate of less than 1% per
year during 1997-2007. This intensity drop appears to be a continuation of the decrease of
≈ 4% per year in the [S II] emission of the HH 1F condensation during the 1987-1994 period
measured by Eisl¨oﬀel et al. (1994). From 2007 to 2014, the [S II] ﬂux grows by ≈% per year
(see Figure 9 and table 2)

The Hα ﬂux (see Figure 9) has drops of ≈ 8% per year during 1994-1997 and of ≈ 2%
per year during 1997-2007. Then, during the 2007-2014 period, the Hα ﬂux has grown at a
rate of ≈ 7% per year. The combination of the Hα and [S II] variabilities leads to a [S II]/Hα
ratio that decreases from 1994 to 1997, and then increases monotonically from 0.7 to ≈ 1
from 1997 to 2014.

Finally, we note that the angular extension of the HH 1 emission (along the outﬂow
axis) has a slight decrease from 1994 to 1997 and then monotonically grows as a function of
time (as can be seen in a qualitative way in the consecutive images shown in Figure 1). In
order to quantify this eﬀect, we have calculated the angular length along the outﬂow axis
of the isophote corresponding to an intensity of 3 × 10−15 erg cm−2s−1 arcsec−2 in the Hα
and [S II] frames. These lengths (calculated from the [S II] and Hα maps) are shown as a
function of time in Figure 10. It is clear that the angular size of HH 1 has grown (by ∼ 20%
in [S II] and ∼ 35% in Hα) during the ∼ 20 year period covered by the HST obserrvations.

6. The [O III] λ 5007 images

There are also two [O III] λ 5007 HST images of HH 1/2 (see Table 1), with a time sep-
aration of ≈ 20 yr. These two images are shown in Figure 11, together with [O III] 5007/Hα
line ratio maps for the two epochs. The line ratios have been computed only for the regions
with an Hα intensity larger than 3 × 10−15 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2.

– 11 –

It is clear that the morphology of the [O III] 5007 emission has changed rather dramat-
ically over the past 20 years. It has become angularly more extended, and has developed
a high [O III] 5007/Hα region along the W wing of HH 1F. Also, in both epochs we see a
central, SE to NW ﬁlament with a relatively high [O III]/Hα ≈ 0.2 value, along the out-
ﬂow axis. This region coincides spatially with the “high proper motion velocity channel”
discussed in section 4.

The [O III] ﬂux (integrated over the 18 × 18 arcsec ﬁeld shown in Figure 11) has a

[O III]/Hα line ratio of the HH 1 ﬁeld has a value of ≈ 0.48 in 1994 and ≈ 0.25 in 2014.

7. Summary: the time evolution of HH 1

As described in sections 3-5, an analysis of four epochs of Hα and [S II] HST images
(covering a time span of 20 years) gives somewhat surprising results. The proper motions of
HH 1 have been measured for many decades:

• Herbig & Jones (1981) measured proper motion velocities of HH 1, obtaining a velocity
of 320 km s−1 for HH 1F and lower velocities (down to 143 km s−1 for HH 1A) for the
trailing condensations from plates obtained from 1959 to 1980. They also determined
a velocity of 444 km s−1 from an earlier series of plates (obtained from 1946 to 1980) in
which HH 1 is unresolved. These authors attribute this larger velocity to the fact that
the morphology of HH 1 changed rather dramatically during the 1946-1980 period, as
in the earlier images the emission was dominated by the region around the HH 1A
condensation,
• Eisl¨oﬀel et al.

(1994) analyzed a set of [S II] CCD images covering the 1986-1994
period, and found a proper motion velocity of 351 km s−1 for HH 1F, and of 98 km s−1
for HH 1A,

• Bally et al. (2002) used HST images in 1994.61 and 1997.58 to obtain peak proper
motion velocities for HH 1F of 320 km s−1 (for [S II]) and 368 km s−1 (for Hα). These
proper motions are consistent, but not identical (see Table 2) to the ones that we are
now determining from these two frames (due to the diﬀerences in the techniques with
which they have been determined).

The velocities given in the items above have been renormalized to a distance of 414 pc to
the HH 1/2 system.

– 12 –

From this, we see that the proper motion velocities observed for the leading region of
HH 1 (HH 1F) appear to have been stable, with values of ∼ 350 km s−1 from 1959 to 1997.
From our analysis of the two later sets of HH 1/2 images obtained with the HST (epochs
2007.63 and 2014.63, see Table 1) we ﬁnd that in more recent times HH 1F appears to have
increased its velocity. This is seen by the fact that the maximum axial velocity of HH 1F
has increased from ∼ 300 to ∼ 600 km s−1 in Hα and from ∼ 330 to ∼ 500 km s−1 in [S II]
over the three frame pairs obtained from 1994 to 2014 (see Table 2). During this period,
we also see an increase in the proper motion velocities obtained for a cross-correlation box
which includes the region of the head of HH 1 (see Figures 1 and 2). The acceleration of
HH 1 is also seen in the proper motion maps (Figures 5 and 7) and velocity distributions
(Figure 8) obtained from a study of the spatially resolved proper motions of the Hα and
[S II] condensations.

Interestingly, the decrease in the [S II] emission of HH 1 observed by Eisl¨oﬀel et al.
(1994) over the 1987 → 1994 period (see their Figure 4) appears to have continued only
until 2007, and the [S II] emission has a higher value in 2014 (see Figure 9). The Hα
emission also decreased from 1994 → 2007, and shows an increase in the 2014 HST image.
The [S II]/Hα ratio ﬁrst decreases from 0.79 (in 1994) to 0.76 (in 1997), and then grows
monotonically, attaining a value of 0.99 in 2014.

The fact that the minimum in the line ratio does not coincide (temporally) with the
minima of the line ﬂuxes (see Figure 9) rules out a simple explanation of the line variability as
a result of variations of the foreground extinction. Also, a variability of the extinction would
produce higher [S II]/Hα ratios at the times of higher extinction (i.e., of lower observed line
intensities). Such a correlation is clearly not seen in HH 1 (see Figure 9)

Finally, we see that in recent years the size of HH 1 (along the outﬂow axis) has increased
quite considerablly. The most dramatic increase is obtained for the Hα emission, which has
grown in extent from ∼ 10 to ∼ 14 arcsec from 1994 to 2014 (see Figure 10). The morphology
observed in the two available [O III] images (1994 and 2014, see Table 1) also presents a
large variability (see Figure 11) and the [O III]/Hα ratio (of the line ﬂuxes integrated over
the emitting region of HH 1) has a decrease from 0.48 (in 1994) to 0.25 (in 2014).

It therefore appears that HH 1 is presently going through a period of substantial changes
in morphology, and in the Hα and [S II] intensities and ratios. These changes are occurring
over timescales of a few years, as evidenced by the large diﬀerences observed between the
2007 and 2014 observations (see Figures 9 and 10). These changes in the emission are
accompanied by the appearance of larger proper motions in some of the features of HH 1
(see Figures 5, 7 and 8).

– 13 –

Given the fact that the proper motion velocities of HH 1 appear to be stable over
relatively long timescales (from 1959 to 1987, see above), we speculate that the present
period of apparent acceleration is likely to be an event of relatively short duration.
In
principle, we could be seeing an event in which an “internal working surface” (produced by
an ejection velocity variability, see, e.g., Raga et al. 1990b) is catching up with the head of
the jet. This would lead to a momentary increase in the speed of the jet head (as modelled
by Cant´o & Raga 2003 and Raga & Cant´o 2003). Such a catching-up would be a complicated
event in a ﬂow with precession or other direction variability (see, e.g., Raga et al. 2010), and
deserves an exploration in terms of 3D numerical simulations. This would illustrate whether
or not such catching-up events can reproduce the present time-evolution of HH 1.

Alternatively, HH 1 might be travelling into an environment with decreasing densities
at larger distances from the outﬂow source. Such a scenario would be consistent with the
model of Henney (1996), who suggested that the side-to-side asymmetries of HH 1 might
be the result of an environmental density gradient perpendicular to the outﬂow axis. An
exploration of this scenario with numerical simulations would also be very interesting.

The present period of large variability might resemble the one reported by Herbig (1973),
who found that HH 1F increased dramatically in brightness (to become the dominant knot
of HH 1) within a gap in a series of Lick plates between 1968 and 1973. It is a real pity that
the details of this fast, 1968 to 1973 evolution have not been observed. It appears that we
now have a second chance of observing major changes in HH 1, and it would deﬁnitely be
worthwhile to obtain (at least reasonably high angular resolution) images in a few lines and
with a good time coverage of HH 1 during the following few years.

We should point out that in measuring proper motions, relative changes in the inten-
sites of diﬀerent regions of an HH object can lead to proper motion velocities which do not
correspond to a real displacement of an emission structure (as described in Section 1, this
was an initial worry of Herbig, who later concluded that real motions were indeed detected).
However, for knot structures that can be recognized (from their similar intensities and mor-
phologies) in pairs of epochs, showing displacements that are larger than the sizes of the
knots, there is little doubt that the knots indeed have coherent motions in the plane of the
sky.

The observed proper motions of course could be motions of the gas itself (“matter mo-
tions”) or a wave structure travelling through a gas with a diﬀerent motion. However, in a
hypersonic ﬂow such as a jet from a young star (with sonic and Alv`enic Mach numbers of
∼ 10 → 100, deduced from radial velocities, proper motions and plasma diagnostic determi-
nations of the temperature), waves travelling through the ﬂow are highly likely to be shock
waves, which (for the densities and velocities measured in HH objects) are highly radiative.

– 14 –

Such radiative shocks have very high compression ratios, so that the post-shock gas has a
motion which closely follows the “normal motion” of the shock wave (i.e., the motion per-
pendicular to the shock front). Therefore, the motions measured for the emitting gas behind
a radiative shock wave closely follow the “matter motion”.

Having said this, it is also clear that in measuring proper motions of details seen in high
resolution images of HH objects (such as the ones described in the present paper), at least in
some cases one might be confusing relative brightness changes with actual motions of coherent
structures. This is an unavoidable problem of carrying out proper motion measurements of
extended structures in the ISM.

However, this is not a major problem for carrying out comparisons with numerical
simulations of diﬀerent scenarios for producing the ﬂow. For example, one can compare the
present proper motion measurements of HH 1 with numerical simulations (e.g., of a radiative
jet from a variable source) in which one predicts the time-evolution of emission line intensity
maps. This can be done, e.g., applying the proper motion detection algorithm described in
Section 4 to a time-sequence of predicted maps, and comparing the proper motions obtained
in this way with our measurements of HH 1 proper motions. The possible confusions between
“matter motions” and relative intensity changes (if present) should occur in the analyses of
both the observed and the numerically predicted emission line maps, so that a comparison
between observations and models is in principle valid.
