ABSTRACT

We have conducted an imaging survey with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide

Field Camera 3 (WFC3) of 70 Galactic Cepheids, typically within 1 kpc, with

the aim of ﬁnding resolved physical companions. The WFC3 ﬁeld typically cov-

ers the 0.1 pc area where companions are expected. In this paper, we identify

39 Cepheids having candidate companions, based on their positions in color–

magnitude diagrams, and having separations ≥ 5′′ from the Cepheids. We use

follow-up observations of 14 of these candidates with XMM-Newton, and of one of

them with ROSAT , to separate X-ray-active young stars (probable physical com-

panions) from ﬁeld stars (chance alignments). Our preliminary estimate, based

on the optical and X-ray observations, is that only 3% of the Cepheids in the

sample have wide companions. Our survey easily detects resolved main-sequence

companions as faint as spectral type K. Thus the fact that the two most prob-

able companions (those of FF Aql and RV Sco) are earlier than type K is not

simply a function of the detection limit. We ﬁnd no physical companions having

separations larger than 4,000 AU in the X-ray survey. Two Cepheids are excep-

tions in that they do have young companions at signiﬁcantly larger separations

(δ Cep and S Nor), but both belong to a cluster or a loose association, so our

working model is that they are not gravitationally bound binary members, but

rather cluster/association members. All of these properties provide constraints

on both star formation and subsequent dynamical evolution. The low frequency

of true physical companions at separations > 5′′ is conﬁrmed by examination of

the subset of the nearest Cepheids and also the density of the ﬁelds.

Introduction

Particular interest is being paid at present to the role of binaries, for instance in

planet formation. Binary/multiple systems have important eﬀects in stellar evolution,

especially of massive stars, which have a high fraction of binaries (e.g., Sana et al. 2012).

A substantial fraction of the massive stars in such systems exchange mass or merge during

post-main-sequence evolution. Binary systems are also progenitors of X-ray sources in later

stages when one component has evolved into a compact object.

An important topic currently under discussion is the question of the formation of

wide binaries. Binaries are considered wide when they have separations of about 1,000

to 10,000 AU, corresponding to orbital periods of approximately 12,000 to 400,000 years.

As discussed by Kouwenhoven et al. (2010), the typical size of a star-forming core is 103

AU, which is also roughly the separation between protostars in young clusters. Forming

multiple star systems wider than this does not follow naturally from a collapse process.

Several scenarios have been proposed to get around this. Kouwenhoven et al. suggest that

distant companions can be acquired as a star cluster disperses. Alternatively, Reipurth &

Mikkola (2012) propose that distant components can result from triple systems that are

formed as compact units, but then “unfold” because they are dynamically unstable, sending

one component to a wider orbit (or ejecting it from the system). When discussing wide

companions, it is of course possible that at least one star is itself actually a closer binary,

i.e., that the system is a hierarchical triple. In this discussion, we use “binary” as shorthand

for “binary or multiple.” A distant component, of course, may result from a mixture of

these processes to augment the few wide systems formed in the collapse process.

The diversity of conﬁgurations in multiple systems provides insights into the evolution

of the stellar population. Single stars can evolve without outside inﬂuence. Stars in binary

systems may interact when the primary expands past the main sequence if their orbital

– 4 –

separations are small enough. At wider separations, the components of binaries follow the

same evolutionary paths as single stars. Triple or higher multiple systems may in addition

have dynamical evolution within the system, which may result in an increased separation

(typically for the smallest member) or even the ejection of a member. Thus, multiple

systems provide a length (separation) measurement. In the case of triple systems, it may

be altered by the internal dynamics. Finally, the widest systems are fragile and subject

to destruction by external passing stars. For all these reasons, the assembly of binary

characteristics, particularly as a function of the mass of the primary, provides a tool to

investigate both formation conditions and subsequent interactions.

To probe these questions, we are making a series of studies of binary systems with a

range of separation and mass ratio. Cepheid variables provide valuable information about

the binary/multiple characteristics of fairly massive stars (typically ∼ 6 M⊙). One of our

studies uses radial velocities from the sharp lines of Cepheids to derive the properties of

spectroscopic-binary systems with periods between about 1 and 20 years (Evans et al.

2015). To provide data about the binary frequency among main-sequence B stars (destined

to become Cepheids), we discussed the Chandra observation of the cluster Tr 16 (Evans et

al. 2011).

In order to explore the widest orbital separations, we have also carried out a survey

for resolved companions of Cepheids, using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and its

Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Initial results from this survey were included in Evans

et al. (2013, hereafter “Paper I”), who discuss the subset of the sample with relatively

high-mass companions derived using IUE observations. Paper I provides the distribution

of separations for systems with mass ratios q = M2/M1 > 0.4, in a sample equally sensitive

across the range of possible separations. The current paper (Paper II) is the second in this

series.

– 5 –

The present paper gives full details of our WFC3 imaging survey of 70 Cepheids, which

was introduced in Paper I. Because of the challenges of identifying and measuring faint

close companions of much brighter Cepheids, we have divided the discussion according to

the detection approach. In the current paper we discuss candidate companions located 5′′ or

more from the Cepheids. For these systems the light of the much brighter Cepheid does not

materially aﬀect photometry of the companions. A subsequent paper (Paper III) will report

on companions closer than 5′′, which are embedded in the wings of the image of the bright

Cepheid; the photometry thus requires a more sophisticated point-spread function (PSF)

subtraction. Since the separation in AU depends both on the apparent separation and the

distance, we defer discussion of the full sample to Paper III, in which we will combine both

separation regimes. Several features of the current study are of note. Information about

resolved companions has advanced greatly with instrumental developments such as adaptive

optics (AO) and interferometry, particularly at small separations. The current study

provides a uniform survey of orbital separations from several hundred AU up to ∼0.1 pc

(including the systems discussed in Paper I and those to be discussed in Paper III). In this

study, very low-mass stellar companions can be detected, but we limit our discussion to stars

hotter than M0 for reasons of ﬁeld contamination and X-ray followup. Important insight

about the possible companions identiﬁed in this paper is provided by XMM-Newton (XMM)

X-ray observations to identify low-mass stars young enough to be physical companions of

the Cepheids (Evans et al. 2016; Paper IV).

This paper is organized as follows. First the sample of 70 Cepheids that were observed

with WFC3 is described. Within this sample we then identify candidate companions with

a separation greater than 5′′ but still within the WFC3 40′′ × 40′′ aperture, and having a

magnitude and color appropriate for a main-sequence star at the the distance and reddening

of the Cepheid (Table A1). For a subset of these candidates, we use XMM-Newton

observations to select those that have the X-ray emission expected for main-sequence stars

– 6 –

with the ages of Cepheids. Finally, we discuss the results in the context of the subset of the

nearest Cepheids, and also ﬁeld density.

2. HST Snapshot Survey

2.1. Observations

We have carried out a snapshot imaging survey of nearby Galactic Cepheids, using the

UVIS channel of the WFC3 camera on HST. Because of the high sensitivity of WFC3 and

the fact that our targets are very bright, we elected to use intermediate-band ﬁlters instead

of the broad-band ones used most often in HST imaging. The two ﬁlters we chose were

F621M and F845M. Magnitudes in these ﬁlters can be transformed reasonably well into

broad-band V and I, respectively.

The program was carried out in HST Cycle 18 (program ID SNAP-12215, PI N.R.E.),

over the interval from 2010 September 20 to 2011 September 11. Our input list of snapshot

targets contained 71 Cepheids. Remarkably, all 71 targets were observed (an unusually high

yield for a snapshot program). However, due to a spacecraft data formatter error, the data

from one of the observations (FM Aql) were lost. Three additional observations suﬀered

failures to acquire one of the two guide stars, but the data are still useful. Our program

therefore successfully covered 70 Galactic Cepheids.

For each WFC3 observation, we centered the Cepheid in a 1024 × 1024-pixel subarray.

The WFC3 UVIS image scale is 0.′′0396 pixel−1, giving a ﬁeld of view of 40′′ × 40′′. We

obtained three dithered exposures in both of the ﬁlters. Exposure times—generally just a

few seconds—were chosen such that the image of the Cepheid (at its average brightness)

would be overexposed, leading to a few saturated pixels at the center of its image. This

overexposure strategy results in companion stars being detectable to faint levels to within

– 7 –

a few pixels of the primary star. The images are available from the Mikulski Archive for

Space Telescopes1, as are the exposure times in each ﬁlter and the dates of the observations.

The 70 Cepheids that were imaged in the survey are listed in Table 1. The input target

list was compiled using the Galactic Cepheid database2 (Fernie et al. 1995). We chose

primarily the nearest Cepheids, most of which are within 1 kpc. To these, we added three

more luminous long-period Cepheids at larger distances (T Mon, RS Pup, and SV Vul). The

pulsation period, intensity-weighted mean V magnitude, and E(B − V ) listed in Table 1

were generally taken directly from the database. The exceptions were a few Cepheids with

relatively bright companions, discussed in Paper I. For these stars, the values of hV i and

E(B − V ) have been corrected for the light of the companion. The data for Y Car have

been taken from Evans (1992), likewise corrected to subtract the light of the companion.

To use the Leavitt (period-luminosity, or P-L) relation to derive a distance, we must

ﬁrst identify those Cepheids that are not pulsating in the fundamental mode. These

“s-Cepheids” were identiﬁed historically based on their low-amplitude, nearly symmetric

sinusoidal light curves (in contrast to the “sawtooth” light curves of fundamental pulsators).

With the development of Fourier decomposition, it was realized that various combinations

of amplitude and phase parameters for low-order modes could distinguish between

fundamental and overtone pulsators. This interpretation was conﬁrmed observationally

with Magellanic Cloud microlensing programs such as the MACHO project (Alcock et al.

1995), which showed two P-L sequences. While this framework is secure, there are still a

few exceptions or puzzles. We have used photometric results (Antonello et al. 1990) to

identify the following as overtone pulsators: SU Cas, IR Cep, BP Cir, AV Cir, DT Cyg,

SZ Tau, LR TrA, and AH Vel. We have added BG Cru, MY Pup, and V950 Sco, based on

2http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/DDO/research/ cepheids/table physical.html

– 8 –

results from radial-velocity curves (Kienzle et al. 1999). In addition, V1334 Cyg is classiﬁed

by Evans (2000) as a ﬁrst-overtone pulsator. The pulsation mode of V440 Per has been

controversial, partly because it has a period of 7.57 days, long enough that some of the

diagnostics become confused. Recent velocity data, however, indicate that it is an overtone

pulsator (Baranowski et al. 2009), which we will adopt. FF Aql, on the other hand, has

many Fourier characteristics of overtone pulsators. However, the HST Fine Guidance

Sensor (FGS) parallax (Benedict et al. 2007) indicates that it pulsates in the fundamental

mode, which we will use.

Two stars in the sample require further discussion. CO Aur is a double-mode Cepheid,

which is excited in the ﬁrst and second overtones (Antonello et al. 1986). We have

fundamentalized the ﬁrst-overtone period (1.78 days) using the relation from Alcock et

al. (1995), as discussed above. V473 Lyr is unique as a Population I Cepheid with a

large variation in pulsation amplitude over a period of approximately 1210 days (Burki &

Mayor 1980). Its absolute magnitude and pulsation mode have been discussed a number

of times. While they are still open to question, the consensus is that it is pulsating in the

second overtone (e.g., Burki et al. 1986; Andrievsky et al. 1998), which is in keeping with

its very short period. We have used the P2/P1 ratio from CO Aur (0.8007) to derive the

ﬁrst-overtone period from the observed period (1.49 days), and then fundamentalized that.

As a point of interest, in addition to CO Aur, the stars Y Car, TU Cas, EW Sct, and U TrA

are also double-mode pulsators.

Distances for the targets, listed in Table 1, were computed in the same way as in

Paper I, based on the Leavitt relation derived from the HST FGS parallaxes of Benedict

et al. (2007). The periods in Table 1 for the overtone pulsators have been fundamentalized

before computing the distance. As discussed in Evans (1991), for broad-band colors, a

Cepheid is less reddened than a hot star by the same intervening material. We compensate

– 9 –

for this by using R = AV /E(B − V ) = 3.46 to compute V0 as needed. For these nearby

Cepheids, the eﬀect of using this value of R rather than the more standard 3.1 is generally

small.

In order to provide a sense of the scope of the survey, Column 6 in Table 1 gives an

estimate of the smallest separation at which companions will be detected when the full

reductions are complete, including the PSF correction to reveal companions within 5′′ of the

Cepheid (Paper III). We have used an estimate of 0.′′3 as the radius limit outside of which

companions can be detected. Column 7 provides the separation in arcseconds corresponding

to 0.1 pc at the distance of the Cepheid. Systems with wider separations are thought to be

disrupted by the Galactic tidal ﬁeld, or through encounters with passing stars. Column 7

shows that a large part of this 0.1 pc zone is contained within the 40′′ × 40′′ WFC3 ﬁeld of

view for most targets.

2.2. Data Reduction and Analysis

As mentioned above, the analysis of the observations is divided into two parts. In this

paper, possible companions more than 5′′ from the Cepheid are discussed. In such cases,

standard aperture photometry can be used straightforwardly. Fig. 1 is a typical image,

showing that light from the Cepheid contributes a complicated background to the image

inside about 5′′.

For the photometric analysis, we use the default drizzle-combined drz.fits images

from the HST archive pipeline. These frames are created by combining the individual

dithered exposures, and are fully processed to bias-subtracted, ﬂat-ﬁelded, and geometrically

corrected images with cosmic rays removed. In the IRAF3 environment, the daofind routine

3IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are oper-

– 10 –

was used to locate all detected stars in the frames, and measure their image coordinates.

When daofind misses targets, a manual examination of the ﬁeld using imexamine provides

the remaining stellar coordinates. Once the coordinate list is compiled, the psfmeasure

routine analyzes the stars at those coordinates and returns a list of FWHMs. An average

FWHM is calculated from this list. The relevant photometric constant (magnitude scale

zero point) was taken from the WFC3 manual4 for Vegamags. They are then entered

into the photometry parameters ﬁle (photpars) and the average FWHM and background

standard deviation are entered into the data parameters ﬁle (datapars). An aperture

radius of 10 pixels (0.′′4) was used. The IRAF photometry package (phot) is then run on

the image to perform aperture photometry, using the star coordinates and parameter ﬁles

as input to produce the stellar magnitudes and their errors.

Examples of the WFC3 images in the F845M ﬁlter are provided for R Cru (Fig. 1),

V Cen (Fig. 3), and FF Aql (Fig. 5).

3. Finding Resolved Physical Companions

3.1.

Isochrones

The goal of our project is to identify candidate resolved physical companions of the

Cepheids imaged in the survey. The selection criterion is that the candidate companion star

must lie in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) near an isochrone for the typical age of a

Cepheid (50 Myr), corrected to the distance and reddening of each Cepheid.

– 11 –

Isochrones in the WFC3 ﬁlters that we used, and in the ground-based V and

Kron-Cousins I bands, are available from two sources. We created a 50 Myr isochrone as

follows. (1) For the unevolved lower main sequence (deﬁned here as V − I > 0.75), we used

the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database5. This compilation gives isochrones in the WFC3

F621M and F845M ﬁlters, and in V and I. We selected isochrones for solar metallicity

([Fe/H] = 0). Unfortunately, for the lowest available age in the Dartmouth isochrones,

1 Gyr, there is a large gap in coverage from V − I ≃ 0.9 to 1.5. We therefore used data from

the 5 Gyr isochrone, which is free of large gaps and agrees very well with the 1 Gyr isochrone

in the color ranges where they do overlap. (2) For the stars with V − I < 0.75, which have

begun to evolve oﬀ the zero-age main sequence in the available Dartmouth isochrones, we

used a “Padova” 50 Myr isochrone6 for a heavy-element content of Z = 0.0152. We again

obtained isochrones in WFC3 F621M and F845M, and in ground-based V and I.

For the unevolved main sequence, we note that the Dartmouth and Padova isochrones

agree reasonably well from V − I ≃ 0.75 to about 1.25. But then they begin to diverge as

we move further down the main sequence, with the Padova absolute magnitudes becoming

progressively fainter than the Dartmouth values. At V − I ≃ 2, the Padova MV values

are fainter than Dartmouth by about 0.6 mag. By comparison with empirical absolute

magnitudes for lower-main-sequence stars with accurate parallaxes (e.g., those assembled by

E. Mamajek7), we ﬁnd that the Dartmouth isochrones, in V, (V − I), give better agreement

with real stars. We therefore adopted a combination of the Padova 50 Myr isochrone for

V − I < 0.75 (and the corresponding isochrone for F 621M and F 845M magnitudes),

and the Dartmouth 5 Gyr isochrone for the unevolved cooler main-sequence stars, as our

standard Cepheid-age solar-composition isochrone.

In the discussion below, we will ﬁnd it useful to transform the WFC3 F 621M

magnitude and F 621M − F 845M color index to ground-based V and V − I. A least-squares

polynomial ﬁt to the Padova-Dartmouth tables gives the following relations, which have

residuals no larger than ±0.02 mag:

V = F 621M + 0.115637x7 − 0.98113x6 + 3.09425x5 − 4.26033x4 + 2.03240x3

+0.14579x2 + 0.46920x + 0.041

and

V − I = −0.06353x5 + 0.48892x4 − 1.20278x3 + 0.86796x2 + 1.36607x + 0.002 ,

where x = F 621M − F 845M.

In order to create an isochrone appropriate for each individual Cepheid, we need to

correct it to the reddening and distance of the Cepheid, given in columns 4 and 5 of Table 1,

respectively. To obtain the reddening law in the WFC3 F621M and F845M ﬁlters, we used

the formulae of Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis (1989), with eﬀective wavelengths of 6210 and

8450 ˚A, respectively. This yields the relations E(F 621M − F 845M) = 1.2 E(B − V ) and

AF 621M = 2.9E(B − V ).

Examples of comparisons of the WFC3 photometry with the 50 Myr isochrone are

given for the ﬁelds surrounding R Cru (Fig. 2) and V Cen (Fig. 4). In these ﬁgures we

have highlighted the region in the isochrone where we expect to be able to detect X-ray

emission from young, low-mass stars (i.e., those with spectral types of F2 V through K7 V,

with unreddened F 621M − F 845M colors ranging from 0.27 to 1.06). Young M dwarfs

– 13 –

also produce X-rays, but the ﬂux drops quickly with advancing spectral type, and at the

distances of our Cepheids we do not expect X-ray emission to be detectable (Evans et

al. 2016). We have therefore neglected candidate M dwarf companions, even though they

would be easily detected in the WFC3 photometry.

3.2. Candidate Companions

Using the HST F 621M vs. F 621M − F 845M CMDs, we selected candidate physical

companions in the following way. In addition to the ZAMS, a line was placed 0.75 mag

above it, indicating the upper limit of binaries of identical mass (e.g., Fig. 2). The region

between these lines is the region where companions are expected, and a list was generated

(Appendix A) of stars within 2σ of this region. The identiﬁcation criteria were guided by

experience with the low-mass members of the S Mus cluster identiﬁed on an XMM image

(Evans et al. 2014). Occasionally additional judgment was invoked. For instance, fainter

stars with errors in the colors greater than 0.2 mag were dismissed as too uncertain for

further consideration.

We examined the CMDs for all the Cepheids for possible companions, ﬁnding

candidates for 39 out of the 70 targets. These 39 Cepheids, and their candidate companions,

are listed in Table A1 in Appendix A. Table A1 contains all candidate companions lying

within 2σ of the ZAMS in the CMDs, and hotter than spectral type M0. The ﬁrst two

columns list the F 621M and F 621M − F 845M magnitudes and colors, and their errors.

For convenience, the next two columns provide the transformed V and V − I. The following

two columns give the angular separations and position angles. The ﬁnal column provides

the projected separations converted to AU, using the distances from Table 1.

Table A1 lists possible companions ≥5′′ from the Cepheid, which is the sample

– 14 –

discussed in the rest of this paper. Additional possible companions were identiﬁed by our

search technique, lying less than 5′′ from the Cepheid. These are listed in Table A2, but

they will only be discussed in Paper III, together with an additional and more complete

catalog of candidate companions identiﬁed in PSF-subtracted images.

Figures 2 and 4 show two examples of the F 621M and F 621M − F 845M CMDs, for

R Cru and V Cen, respectively. For these two Cepheids, there is one star within 2σ of this

part of the ZAMS, which are the potential companion candidates. These stars are circled

on Figs. 1 and 3. These ﬁgures are typical in two respects. The CMDs rule out all but a

very few stars in the ﬁeld as possible companions. That is, the companion range we were

working with was something of a “sweet spot,” with relatively few interlopers. In addition,

even at the low galactic latitudes of Cepheids, the ﬁeld only becomes heavily populated

fainter than the M0 limit.

4. X-ray Conﬁrmation

Because faint red stars are common in the Galactic plane, it is important to conﬁrm

that our candidate companions are physical, rather than chance alignments with ﬁeld stars.

As discussed above, chance alignments would be much more common in a deeper survey,

but it is still important to evaluate the relatively bright candidates in Table A1. Physical

companions of Cepheids must be the same age as the Cepheids themselves, typically 50

Myr. Low-mass stars with a chromosphere have decreasing rotation rates as they age

because of magnetic braking (e.g., Pallavicini et al. 1981). For this reason, stars young

enough to be Cepheid companions are easily distinguished from old ﬁeld stars by their

X-ray ﬂuxes. We are conducting a series of observations of the Cepheids in Table A1 using

the XMM-Newton satellite, to be described in Paper IV (Evans et al. 2016). An example is

provided by S Mus (Evans et al. 2014). So far 14 of our 39 Cepheids with possible resolved

– 15 –

companions have been observed with XMM (ℓ Car, V659 Cen, V737 Cen, R Cru, S Cru,

X Cyg, V473 Lyr, R Mus, S Mus, S Nor, Y Oph, V440 Per, U Sgr, and Y Sgr), to a depth

where essentially all the K stars (and hotter) at the distance of the Cepheid with an age of

50 Myr would be detected. There is also an upper limit on W Sgr from the ROSAT All Sky

Survey (§5.3 below).

The X-ray results are summarized as follows:

• Our wide candidate companions are overwhelmingly not young X-ray active stars,

and hence are unlikely to be physical companions. Twenty-three candidate companions

with separations ≥8′′ (with the exception of S Nor; see below), and three with smaller

separations (V737 Cen, R Mus, and Y Sgr), were rejected because of the lack of an X-ray

detection.

• R Cru has an X-ray source in its ﬁeld; however, at XMM resolution, the source

could be assigned either to the Cepheid or the candidate companion star at 7.′′6 (6,330 AU).

However, there is an even closer source in the WFC3 images, to be discussed in Paper III

because its separation is only 1.′′9. In the following we assume that this closer source

produces the X-rays.

• S Mus similarly has an X-ray source, but again XMM observations cannot

distinguish between the Cepheid and the possible companion at 5.′′0 (3,950 AU). We have

subsequently obtained a Chandra observation of the S Mus ﬁeld. Because of its higher

spatial resolution, we can now conclude that the X-rays come not from the 5.′′0 companion,

but from the Cepheid/spectroscopic binary. (Full discussion of the results is in preparation.)

Thus at present we can say that there are no resolved physical companions of Cepheids at

4,000 AU or wider.

• S Nor is our one Cepheid with an X-ray source unequivocally at the position of a

– 16 –

resolved companion, with a projected separation of 14.′′6 (13,300 AU). This is signiﬁcantly

wider than the companions of either R Cru or S Mus. However, S Nor is a member of a

populous cluster. For this reason, and based on the discussion below in §6, we consider it

likely that it is a chance alignment with a cluster member, rather than a gravitationally

bound binary companion.

Thus our preliminary “working model” is that physical companions of Cepheids are

found at separations within about 4,000 AU; however, in a cluster there may be wider

alignments, but they are probably not bound system members.

4.1. The Most Probable Companions

One of the goals of this study is to examine the range of separations of physical

companions to Cepheids. We use the X-ray results on the lack of wide physical companions

to apply another ﬁlter to the list of possible companions (Table A1). Speciﬁcally, we

examine in detail the Cepheids with candidates lying at separations ≥ 5′′ and ≤ 6330 AU.

The 6330 AU upper limit is based on R Cru, the widest of the possible X-ray companions,

although we conclude in Paper IV that the X-rays are most probably produced by a

closer companion (to be discussed in Paper III). Table 2 lists this subset of 11 candidate

companions (of ten Cepheids). The ﬁrst ﬁve columns are taken from Table A1. Column 6

in Table 2 summarizes the X-ray results.

We now examine further evidence whether the stars in Table 2 are physically related

to the Cepheids. Four of the Cepheids have been observed in X-rays (V737 Cen, R Mus, W

Sgr, and Y Sgr), and were not detected; these four are listed at the bottom of the table; see

§5.3 for W Sgr). Thus, for the total sample of 70 Cepheids in our survey, ten of them have

potential resolved companions (≥ 5′′) within 7000 AU. However, when the X-ray results are

– 17 –

folded in, four are eliminated. Of the six stars observed by XMM or ROSAT (including R

Cru and S Mus), four were not detected, and hence are probably ﬁeld stars. The remaining

two sources that were detected (R Cru and S Mus) are so close to the Cepheid that both the

Cepheid and the companion are within the XMM PSF. However, in both cases, additional

evidence indicated that the resolved companion candidate is not the X-ray source. R Cru

has a closer companion which we consider a more probable X-ray candidate (see Paper

III). The Chandra observation of S Mus also shows that the X-rays are produced by the

Cepheid/spectroscopic binary.

We can use Table 2 to make an estimate of the companion frequency (≥ 5′′) within

7000 AU. from the Cepheid. Since none of the 6 possible companions ≥ 5′′ which have

observed in X-rays have been detected, the remaining four Cepheids (TT Aql, FF Aql, AP

Sgr, and RV Sco) might have the same detection rate. However, the companions of FF Aql

(§5.2) and RV Sco (below) are both likely to be physical companions since they appear to

share a proper motion. Furthermore, anticipating the discussion for ﬁeld density (§6), the

fact that TT Aql has 2 possible companions as well as 5 possible companions in the whole

ﬁeld makes it unlikely that the 2 stars listed in Table 2 are bound binary companions. This

leaves only 1 star (AP Sgr) in Table 2 as a possiblity, but with the low X-ray detection rate,

it is also unlikely. Thus, the binary rate in this separation range is 2 (RV Sco and FF Aql)

out of 70 or 3%.

RV Sco has additional information from proper motions. The Washington Double

Star Catalog (WDS)8 has measures for the pair in 1925 and 1987, showing no relative

motion between the two stars. The total motion of the Cepheid is about half an arcsecond

in that period, indicating that the two are moving together, and thus likely bound.

– 18 –

Column 9 in Table 2 lists the intrinsic (V − I)0 color, using the E(B − V ) from

Table 1 and E(V − I)/E(B − V ) = 1.15 (assuming, of course, that the stars have the same

reddening as the Cepheids). All the possible companions have the colors of K stars, except

for FF Aql and RV Sco, where the possible companions have hotter colors. (These colors

are hot enough that the companions would not be expected produce X-rays.) K stars are

certainly reasonable companions for Cepheids. On the other hand, they are also the most

plentiful ﬁeld stars in the range under consideration, and hence the most likely to be chance

alignments. The fact that the two most probable companions (FF Aql and RV Sco) in

Table 2 are more massive than K stars suggests the companion distribution is top heavy as

compared to the Initial Mass Function (IMF). This is clearly not due to the detection limit,

since K dwarfs are easily detected in the WFC3 survey.

Anticipating the discussion of ﬁeld density (§6), we list in Column 8 the number of

possible companions (Table A1) with separations ≥5′′ for each Cepheid. As fully discussed

below (§6), a large number of possible companions increases the probability that the

possible companions are not gravitationally bound. On these grounds, the companions of

TT Aql and RV Sco are suspect. We note that the discussion of proper motions above

implies that the RV Sco companion is indeed related to the Cepheid.

The following summarizes the discussion above of the frequency of resolved companions

as well at the outer extent:

• Both of the estimates of the companion frequency for separations ≥5′′ are 3% or less.

• We have identiﬁed no probable companions wider than RV Sco (4520 AU). Thus

4000 AU is a reasonable estimate for the extent of companions from our summary.

– 19 –

5. The Nearer Cepheids

In this section and the next one, we discuss two tests to conﬁrm the relative scarcity of

physical companions with a projected separation from the Cepheid of ≥5′′.

In order to conﬁrm the X-ray results that stars in the outer parts of the ﬁeld are

chance alignments, we created Table 3, containing the subset of Cepheids nearer than

600 pc. These are the Cepheids that are least likely to be contaminated by ﬁeld stars at

the brightnesses expected for physical companions. Column 2 indicates whether there is

a possible companion on the WFC3 images with “Yes”; column 3 indicates whether the

possible companion has not been detected in an X-ray observation with a “No.” Since the

nearest Cepheids have the most complete information, we are able to discuss three of them

in more detail, as follows.

5.1.

δ Cep

δ Cep poses a special challenge in determining its relation to the star HD 213307, a late

B star 40′′ away. Parallaxes were determined for both stars using the HST FGS by Benedict

et al. (2002). They found both stars to be at the same distance within the errors, and also

found that HD 213307 is itself a binary from the astrometry. Proper motions and radial

velocities of δ Cep and HD 213307 are similar but not identical. Both stars are listed as

members of the newly discovered Cep OB6 association (de Zeeuw et al. 1999). HD 213307

is not within our WFC3 image, but that is because δ Cep is so nearby. At its distance,

the projected separation is 10,200 AU. This is larger than the separations (Table 2) for

the most probable companions, set largely by the X-ray results. It is also the outlier in

the separation distribution for Cepheids with reasonably massive companions (Fig. 5 in

Evans et al. 2013). Is HD 213307 gravitationally bound to δ Cep? If so, the separation is

– 20 –

unusually wide. On the other hand, because they belong to an association, the possibility

of a chance alignment with a star at the same distance is enhanced.

5.2. FF Aql

FF Aql has been a candidate for a wide binary for many years. It has a comparatively

bright possible companion 7′′ from the Cepheid (Fig. 5). This small separation, however,

has made it diﬃcult to determine the colors of the companion from the ground, because

of scattered light from the Cepheid. Udalski & Evans (1993) concluded that the two

stars are not related based on photometry. The HST results (Table 2 and Fig. 6) place

the companion within the expected main-sequence band. Thus, based on the CMD and

separation, the companion to FF Aql is probably a physical companion. The V − I color in

Table 2 (dereddened) corresponds to a main-sequence star between F5 and G0 (Drilling &

Landolt 2000). This would make the Cepheid a member of a triple system, since it is also a

member of a spectroscopic binary. As with RV Sco, measurements of the positions of the

two stars since 1886 (WDS) indicate no relative motion, indicating that they are a physical

pair.

5.3. W Sgr

W Sgr is already known to be a member of a complicated multiple system.

It

is a spectroscopic binary (Petterson et al. 2004, and references therein) with a very

low-amplitude orbit, but a fairly massive companion (Evans 1995). Recently Evans, Massa,

& Proﬃtt (2009) used an HST observation to demonstrate that the hottest star in the

system is actually a resolved companion (projected separation 0.′′16), not the secondary in

the spectroscopic binary. Thus, the star with a separation of 6.′′3 (2580 AU) in Table 2

– 21 –

would be the fourth star in the system if it is a physical companion.

Because W Sgr is a nearby system, the results of the ROSAT All Sky Survey9

provide useful information. No source was visible at the position of the system. From the

background and exposure map, an upper limit to the count rate of 0.0012 cts sec−1 was

derived. (The PSF of ROSAT is ∼45′′.) The ROSAT PSPC (energy 0.1 to 2.4 keV) was

converted to a ﬂux in 0.5 to 8.0 keV, using PIMMS with kT = 0.48 keV and NH = 1021 cm

derived from the E(B − V ). The ﬂux upper limit derived from the count rate is 1.61 × 10−14

ergs cm−2 sec−1. At a distance of 409 pc, this becomes an upper limit of LX = 3.2 × 1029

ergs sec−1 (log LX = 29.51). This is slightly above the limit for X-ray ﬂux, log LX = 29.2,

used in Paper IV (Evans et al. 2016) as the lower limit for low-mass stars young enough to

be Cepheid companions. However, it is low enough that we consider it improbable that it is

actually a physical companion, and treat it as such here.

5.4. Polaris

We add one additional star to the discussion of nearby Cepheids, even though it was

not included in the WFC3 survey: Polaris. Like δ Cep, it has a resolved companion 18′′

from the Cepheid. The companion Polaris B has a proper motion consistent with orbital

motion in a wide orbit. The spectral type of the companion (summarized by Evans et al.

2010) is F3 V. A Chandra observation found that it is not an X-ray source (Evans et al.

2010), which is not surprising for an early F star. Using the distance from Hipparcos (130

pc; Feast & Catchpole 1997; van Leeuwen 2007), the companion has a projected separation

from the Cepheid of 2340 AU, well within the range of the most probable companions

(Table 2). To complete the list of system components, Polaris is a member of a 30 year

9http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/cgi-bin/rosat/rosat-survey

– 22 –

astrometric binary, whose secondary has been detected by HST (Evans et al. 2008).

5.5. The Nearer Cepheids: Summary

The sample of the nearest Cepheids in Table 3 has 21 stars, of which seven have

possible companions in the WFC3 images. An additional nearby Cepheid, δ Cep, has a

companion which is not on a WFC3 image because of its wide angular separation. Of the

eight stars with possible companions, ﬁve have been observed with XMM or ROSAT, and

the companions were not detected; hence they are classed as chance optical alignments with

ﬁeld stars. The three remaining possibilities in Table 3 are δ Cep, FF Aql, and V636 Cas.

If we further apply the criterion from the XMM observations in the previous section that

only stars closer than 6330 AU are probable physical companions, V636 Cas and δ Cep are

disqualiﬁed. This leaves one star out of 21 in Table 3 with a probable resolved companion

(5%). This is, of course, a very small sample, but since this subsection of the sample is the

least likely to be contaminated by ﬁeld stars, it conﬁrms the small companion fraction from

the combined WFC3 and XMM observations. (Including Polaris, the companion fraction

rises to 2 out of 22 [9%].)

We note also that the companion of Polaris is signiﬁcantly more massive than a K

star, like those of FF Aql and RV Sco. On the other hand, the four stars rejected by X-ray

observations Table 2 are all K stars, leaving two Cepheids with possible K companions

(TT Aql and AP Sgr). This suggests a preference for more massive companions than the

distribution of the IMF.

In our working model (§4), we add δ Cep to S Nor #4 as Cepheids which are members

of known clusters or associations, and hence likely to have a chance alignment with a related

but not gravitationally bound star.

– 23 –

6. Field Stellar Density

The second test we have made is to check whether the occurrence of a possible

companion depends on the surface density of stars in the ﬁeld. We generated a frequency

distribution for the number of ﬁelds with 1, 2, 3, . . . companions from Table A1 (i.e., the

companions >5′′ from the Cepheid), and similarly for Table A2 (companions <5′′ from

the Cepheid). Fig. 7 shows the comparison. Only a very small fraction of the ﬁelds with

one or two companions have possible companions <5′′. In contrast, approximately half

the more dense ﬁelds (three or more possible companions) have possible companions closer

than 5′′. This is consistent with the possibility that denser ﬁelds are linked with increased

chance alignment. This supports the working model that some Cepheids may have been

formed in a loose grouping as well as gravitationally bound systems. Fig. 7 conﬁrms that,

in the overwhelming majority of ﬁelds with 0, 1, or 2 possible companions (59 ﬁelds), the

occurrence of a possible companion ≥5′′ is very rare (2%).

7. Discussion

We have made a further check on the working model, speciﬁcally that in addition

to gravitationally bound system members, star formation may have produced some

surrounding groups with a range of densities from very low to well-populated well-known

clusters. Two recent studies have identiﬁed Cepheids related to clusters based on criteria

including proper motions (Anderson et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2015). Of the Cepheids that

they conclude are deﬁnitely associated with clusters or associations, seven are in our survey

(U Sgr, SU Cyg, S Nor, BB Sgr, V Cen, S Mus, and X Cyg—although X Cyg is only

considered a deﬁnite member by Chen et al.). For these stars we examine the evidence

of the existence of nearby stars at the same distance using Tables A1 and A2. None of

these Cepheids are in the 30 ﬁelds (43%) which have no possible companions. Three (U

– 24 –

Sgr, S Nor, and X Cyg) have more than one possible companion. Of the 4 which have

been observed in X-rays (U Sgr, S Nor, X Cyg, and S Mus), one X-ray source at a wide

companion (S Nor). Thus, even for this group there is at only one possible related star

outside the separation range (4000 AU) where we ﬁnd gravitationally bound binaries. We

draw attention to possible wide associations, particularly as low density groupings may be

of particular interest when Gaia results are available.

This paper focuses on the extent of gravitationally bound systems for ∼ 6 M⊙ Cepheids.

The fraction with companions wider than 103 AU is very small conﬁrming that the frequency

distribution for binary systems peaks at much smaller separations. Although full analysis

of the frequency distribution as a function of separation/period awaits the discussion of

closer companions (Paper III), we can compare results on the extent of companions with

studies in other mass ranges. For O stars, the recent high-resolution study of Sana et al.

(2014; SMASH) found a decrease in the number of comparatively bright companions at

separations of approximately 2000 AU, as discussed by Evans et al. (2016; Paper IV). For

solar-mass stars, Raghavan et al. (2010) and Tokovinin (2014) both ﬁnd a decrease in the

frequency of companions at periods >105 years (≃3000 AU), also in approximate agreement

with the results of the present survey.

8. Summary

We report here the results of an HST WFC3 snapshot imaging survey of 70 classical

Cepheids. This paper (Paper II in the series) discusses possible companions with separations

≥5′′ from the Cepheid.

• We identify possible companions by comparison of the F 621M vs. F 621M − F 845M

CMD with evolutionary tracks at the distance and with the reddening of the Cepheids with

– 25 –

a width allowing for a binary sequence. The list of 39 possible Cepheids with companions

(Table A1) should fully cover the spatial extent of possible companions and identify them

through main-sequence stars of K spectral types.

• Fourteen of the possible companions have been observed with XMM (details in

Paper IV) to distinguish active stars as young as Cepheids from old ﬁeld stars. From these

observations, we ﬁnd no young stars at a larger separation from the Cepheid than that of

S Mus (5.′′0 or 3950 AU). However, the XMM observation does not resolve the companion

and the Cepheid. A Chandra observation shows that the X-rays are not produced by the

star at 5.′′0 separation, but from the Cepheid/spectroscopic binary.

• Based on the X-ray results (Paper IV) of a subset of 14 Cepheids with possible

companions we estimate a frequency of companions ≥ 5′′ to be 3% or less.

• Companions more massive than K stars predominate among the most probable

companions, which cannot be due to the WFC3 detection limit.

• We have conﬁrmed the outer extent of gravitationally bound systems from the subset

of Cepheids closer than 600 pc, which are the least susceptible to chance alignments with

ﬁeld stars, and ﬁnd a comparable frequency of probable companions.

• Similarly using the list of companions closer than 5′′ of the Cepheids (Table A2,

the most likely to be bound system members), we compare the number of close possible

companions with the ﬁeld density as indicated by the number of possible companions in

Table A1. Fields with three or more possible companions are more likely to have close

companions, which we attribute to increased probability of chance alignment in the denser

ﬁelds (loose groupings).

• The working model is that the possible companions stars in Table A1 may include

both bound system members, and also stars formed at the same time in the same

– 26 –

neighborhood. This may be the case of HD 213307 (δ Cep companion) and S Nor #4, since

both the Cepheids are members of clusters or associations, which may account for their

unusually wide separations.

Thus, in this paper we focus on the outer extent of Cepheid multiple systems. As

noted in the introduction, systems this wide could easily support an inner binary, hence be

part of a triple system. In the next paper (Paper III) we will discuss companions less that

5′′ from the Cepheid and then the characteristics of the combined population of resolved

binary companions.

A. Appendix A

The candidate companions of the Cepheids in the survey (§3.2) are listed here. The

columns in the table are the Vega-scale F621M magnitudes and F 621M − F 845M colors,

followed by these values transformed to ground-based V and V − I. The ﬁnal three columns

are the separation from the Cepheid in arcseconds, the position angle in degrees, and the

separation in AU using the distance in Table 1. Table A1 lists companions which are ≥5′′

from the Cepheid; Table A2 contains possible companions <5′′ from the Cepheid. Table A2

will be discussed primarily in Paper III, but is included here because the search techniques

are the same as those in Table A1.
