Abstract—Cache-enabled device-to-device

(D2D) networks
turn memory of the devices at the network edge, such as smart
phones and tablets, into bandwidth by enabling asynchronous con-
tent sharing directly between proximate devices. Limited storage
capacity of the mobile devices necessitates the determination of
optimal set of contents to be cached on each device. In order
to study the problem of optimal cache placement, we model the
locations of devices in a ﬁnite region (e.g., coffee shop, sports
bar, library) as a uniform binomial point process (BPP). For
this setup, we ﬁrst develop a generic framework to analyze
the coverage probability of the target receiver (target-Rx) when
the requested content is available at the kth closest device to
it. Using this coverage probability result, we evaluate optimal
caching probability of the popular content to maximize the
total hit probability. Our analysis concretely demonstrates that
optimal caching probability strongly depends on the number of
simultaneously active devices in the network.

I. INTRODUCTION

Video-driven applications, such as on-demand video stream-
ing and mobile television, are primary drivers of the explosion
in mobile data trafﬁc [1]. Empirical studies of the distribution
of video requests reveals a high degree of spatiotemporal
correlation in the content demanded, which means that a few
popular videos are requested by multiple users at different
times [2]. However, the current cellular network do not ex-
ploit this spatiotemporal correlation exhibited in the content
demand, which can be effectively used as an active part of the
future networks design. In particular, popular contents can be
locally cached at the edge of the network such as in small cell
base stations (BSs) or mobile devices and then delivered over
a direct link to the user who requests them [3]–[5]. However,
limited storage capacity of the edge devices necessitates the
need for developing optimal caching strategies. While this
problem has been addressed for inﬁnite networks in [6]–[10],
more relevant D2D use case of ﬁnite networks has not yet been
addressed in the literature. The modeling and performance
analysis of optimal geographical caching in ﬁnite wireless
networks is therefore the main focus of this paper.

Related work. Modeling and analysis of the cache-enabled
heterogeneous networks (HetNets) including small cell BSs
and mobile devices have taken two main directions in the
literature. The ﬁrst line of work focuses on the fundamen-
tal throughput scaling results by assuming simple protocol
channel model, where communication between two nodes is

successful if they are within the ﬁxed collaboration distance
[11], [12]. The second line of work which is also relevant
to the current work considers a more realistic model for the
underlying physical layer, where the successful communica-
tion depends on physical quantities such as the path-loss,
fading, and interference power. More speciﬁcally, these works
focus on optimal cache-placement strategies in D2D or ultra-
dense HetNets by using the tools from stochastic geometry
[6]–[10]. The most popular technical approach amongst these
works is modeling the locations of nodes (devices or small
cell BSs) as an inﬁnite homogenous Poisson Point Process
(PPP) and assume that each device connects to its closest
possible serving node. The main reason behind the popularity
of this approach is the simplicity involved in the mathematical
analysis as demonstrated in [13]. This setup albeit relevant
for the traditional cellular architecture,
is not adequate in
D2D and ultra-dense cache-enabled HetNets where the content
of interest may not necessarily be available at the closest
node (device or small cell BS) to the target-Rx. Relaxing this
constraint, [6] deﬁned an optimization problem that determines
the optimal caching strategy using the k-coverage results
for an inﬁnite PPP derived in [14]. In continuation to [6],
we determine the optimal geographic caching strategy for
ﬁnite wireless networks in this paper. To the best of our
understanding, this is the ﬁrst work on optimal caching in
ﬁnite networks. More details are provided next.

Contributions and outcomes. We model the locations of
devices in a ﬁnite wireless network as a uniform-BPP. For
this setup, we develop a new set of tools to characterize
the “exact” expression of the coverage probability where the
serving device is the kth closest device to the target-Rx out
of the N t transmitting devices. To perform this analysis, we
prove that the distance from interfering devices conditioned
on the location of the serving device are independently and
identically distributed (i.i.d.). Using this i.i.d. property, we
derive a closed-form expression for the Laplace transform
of interference distribution that is the main component of
the coverage probability analysis. This coverage probability
result for ﬁnite networks is analogous to the k-coverage result
of [14] and can be easily incorporated into the optimization
formulation of [6] in order to characterize throughput and
determine the optimal caching strategy that maximizes total
hit probability in ﬁnite networks. Our analysis demonstrates
that the increasing number of active devices has a conﬂicting
effect on the maximum hit probability and the throughput:
maximum hit probability decreases and throughput increases.
This shows that more and more devices can be simultaneously
activated as long as the hit probability remains acceptable.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

System setup and key assumption: We consider a cache-
enabled D2D network comprising N t + 1 devices that include
target-Rx and N t transmitting devices. Modeling the locations
of transmitting devices as a uniform-BPP {yi} ≡ Φt, we
assume that N t transmitting devices are independently and
uniformly distributed in the ball of radius rd centered at
origin, which is denoted by b(0, rd). We further assume that
N a out of N t transmitting (serving and interfering) devices
simultaneously reuse the same resource block. The locations of
simultaneously active devices is denoted by Φa. For this setup,
we perform analysis on a target-Rx located at origin. Note that
while our analysis is, in principle, extensible to any arbitrarily
located target-Rx, we limit it to this case due space constrains.
The analysis corresponding to the arbitrarily located target-Rx
will be provided in the extended version of this paper.

Channel model: In order to pose an optimization problem
similar to [6] for ﬁnite networks, we are interested in the case
where the content of interest for the target-Rx is available at its
kth closest device out of N t transmitting devices, where 1 ≤
k ≤ N t. Fixing the location of this serving device which is
denoted by yk, we assume that the interfering devices, located
at yi ∈ Φa \ yk ⊂ Φt, are chosen uniformly at random from
the set of transmitting devices. To keep the notation simple,
we assume that the thermal noise is negligible compared to the
interference and is hence ignored. So, the signal to interference
ratio (SIR) is:

−α
hi(cid:107)yi(cid:107)−α ,

−α model Rayleigh fading and

(cid:80)
where hi ∼ exp(1) and (cid:107).(cid:107)
power law path-loss with exponent α > 2, respectively.
Remark 1 (Scale invariance of BPP network). The SIR as
deﬁned in (1) is independent of the network radius rd because
both serving and interfering devices are chosen from the same
point process. This is mainly because by changing rd, all
distances scale with the same parameter. So, without loss of
generality, we normalize rd to 1.

Content popularity: We consider a ﬁnite library of popular
contents C = {c1, c2, ..., cJ } with size J , where cj denotes
the jth most popular content. For simplicity of exposition,
we assume that all the content has the same size, which is
normalized to one. We further assume that the transmitting
devices are equipped with cache storage of size mc and hence
each device can store at most mc popular contents. Now,
denoting the speciﬁc set of contents at a generic transmitting
device by Ω, the caching probability is: bj = P(cj ∈ Ω),
where bj denotes the probability that the content cj is stored
at a given transmitting device. To model the content popularity
in this system, we use Zipf’s distribution due to its practical
relevance [2]. Hence, the request probability for ﬁle cj is:

where γ represents the parameter of Zipf’s distribution.

III. OPTIMAL CONTENT PLACEMENT

This is the main technical section of this paper, where
we characterize network performance in terms of total hit
probability, coverage probability, and network throughput.
Before going into the detailed analyses of these metrics, we
ﬁrst characterize the distribution of the distances from the
target-Rx to the transmitting devices in the next subsection.

A. Relevant Distance Distributions in a BPP

In our setup, the target-Rx is assumed to be located at
the origin while the transmitting devices are uniformly and
independently distributed in b(0, rd). Therefore, it is easy to
infer that the sequence of distances from transmitting devices
to the target-Rx which is denoted by {Wi = (cid:107)yi(cid:107)} contains
i.i.d. elements with PDF and CDF given by [15]:

PDF :

fWi(wi) =

0 ≤ wi ≤ rd,

0 ≤ wi ≤ rd.

(4)

Recall that the serving device is the kth closest transmitting
device to the target-Rx. In order to characterize the serving
distance distribution, we need to “order” the distances from
transmitting devices to the target-Rx. We deﬁne an ordered
set {wi:N t}i=1:N t by sorting wi-s in ascending order such that
w1:N t < w2:N t < ... < wN t:N t . Now, using the i.i.d. property
of the sequence {Wi}, the PDF of the serving distance R =
Wk:N t is:

f (k)
R (r) =

N t!

FWi(r)k−1

(k − 1)!(N t − k)!

× fWi(r)(1 − FWi(r))N t−k,

(5)

where, f (k)
R (r) can be obtained simply from the PDF of the
k order statistics of the sequence {Wi} [16]. It
is worth
highlighting that the interfering devices can lie at any place
except the location of the serving device. This means that
the kth closest transmitting device to the target receiver is
explicitly removed from the interference ﬁeld. In order to
incorporate this in the analysis, we partition the set of distances
from transmitting devices to the target-Rx into three subsets
B = {Bin, wk:N t,Bout} such that Bin and Bout represent the
set of potential interfering devices closer and farther to the
target-Rx respectively, compared to the serving device. This

setup is illustrated in Fig. 1. The following Lemma deals with
conditional i.i.d. property of Uin ∈ Bin and Uout ∈ Bout,
and provides their density functions. The proof is provided in
Appendix A.
Lemma 1. The sequences of random variables Uin ∈ Bin
and Uout ∈ Bout conditioned on r = wk:N t are independent.
Moreover,
i) the elements in sequence Uin ∈ Bin conditioned on r =

wk:N t are i.i.d., where the PDF of each element is:

fUout (uout|r) =

1−FWi (r) , uout > r

where fWi (.) and FWi (.) are given by (3) and (4), respectively.
In [17], [18], we proved a similar i.i.d. property for the
distribution of distances in Thomas cluster process. The con-
ditional i.i.d. property of Uin ∈ Bin and Uout ∈ Bout is
the key enabler for the analysis of the Laplace transform of
interference, which is discussed in the next subsection.

B. Laplace Transform of Interference Distribution

As will be evident in the sequel, the characterization of
Laplace transform of interference distribution is the key inter-
mediate step in the coverage probability analysis. The “exact”
closed-form expression of the Laplace transform of inter-
ference where serving device is the kth closest transmitting
device to the target-Rx is given in the next Lemma. The proof
is provided in Appendix B.

C. Coverage Probability

Coverage probability is deﬁned as the probability that SIR
exceeds predeﬁned threshold needed to establish a successful
connection. The coverage probability of the target-Rx in a
ﬁnite network is derived in the next Theorem.
Theorem 1. Using the expression of Laplace transform of
interference distribution given by (8), the coverage probability
of the target-Rx is:

(cid:90) rd
0 L(k)I (βrα|r)f (k)

R (r)dr,

P(k)
c =

where (a) follows from h0 ∼ exp(1). The ﬁnal result follows
from the deﬁnition of Laplace transform, followed by de-
conditioning over serving distance R.

Using the result of Theorem 1, we now derive a closed-form
upper bound on the coverage probability in the next Corollary.
The result can be readily derived by ignoring the contribution
of interference from interfering devices farther than the serving
device to the target-Rx, and substituting s = βrα in the
expression of Laplace transform interference distribution given
by (8).

bounded by

Remark 2. From Corollary 1, it is clear that the coverage
probability has a power-law behavior with the exponent of
k − 1 when all transmitting nodes are simultaneously active.
We plot the coverage probability for different values of k
in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the “exact” expression of the
coverage probability given by Theorem 1 and the simulation
result match perfectly which conﬁrms the accuracy of the
analysis. As expected, the closed-form expression given by
Corollary 1 gets tight with increasing k while being exact for
k = N t. The upper bound, however, gets loose with increasing
target SIR threshold. This is mainly because the impact of
interfering devices in Bout on the coverage probability is more
prominent for large SIR threshold.

D. Total Hit Probability and Throughput

-60-40-20020SIRthreshold,β(dB)00.20.40.60.81Coverageprobability,P(k)cTheorem1Corollary1SimulationIncreasingk=1:NtAs deﬁned in [6], the total hit probability is the probability
that the target-Rx ﬁnds its requested content in one of the
devices that cover it, which in turn depends on: i) request
probability, which is assumed to be known a priori, ii) caching
probability, which is dictated by the availability of the popular
contents, and iii) coverage probability that guarantees the
minimum SIR for successful reception. Recalling that
the
caching probability and the request probability for content cj
were denoted by bj and PRj , the total hit probability can be
mathematically expressed as:

PRj

j=1

k=1

P(k)

Phit =

c (1 − bj)k−1bj

(12)
where (1 − bj)k−1bj indicates that the closest device with
content of interest is kth closest device to the target-Rx. In
other words, the content of interest was not found at (k − 1)
closet transmitting devices to the target-Rx. On the same lines
as [6], the problem of optimal geographic caching in ﬁnite
wireless networks can be formulated as:

where P (k)
is the new coverage probability result derived in
Theorem 1. The necessity and sufﬁciency of the constraints
given by (14) has already been discussed in [6]. For better
understanding of this optimization problem, Fig. 3 plots the
total hit probability for the simple setup of J = 2, and
mc = 1. It can be seen that by increasing the number of
simultaneously active transmitting devices, Na, the optimal
caching probability for the most popular content (i.e., b1)
moves toward one. This is mainly because increasing Na
results in higher interference, which in turn decreases cov-
erage probability. For example when there is only one active
device (completely orthogonal channel allocation), coverage
probability is equal to one under interference limited regime.
Hence, it is optimal to cache the two contents with the same
probability, i.e., b1 = b2 = 0.5. However, by increasing the
number of active transmitting devices, P(k)
for k > 1 decreases
signiﬁcantly due to increased interference. As demonstrated in
Fig. 3, this makes it optimal to cache the more popular contents
more often. Though channel orthogonalization is beneﬁcial in
terms of total hit probability, it is not desirable for the network
throughput which favors having multiple active links as long
as the resulting interference remains acceptable. To study the
tradeoff between the number of active links and the resulting
interference, we formally deﬁne throughput as: T∗ = N a P∗
hit.
Figs. 4 and 5 plot maximum hit probability and throughput
versus number of active transmitting devices, respectively.
Interestingly, increasing the number of active devices has a
conﬂicting effect on the maximum hit probability and the
throughput: maximum hit probability decreases and through-
put increases. This implies that more devices can be simul-
taneously activated if the total hit probability remains within
acceptable limits.

IV. CONCLUSION

Modeling the locations of the devices as a uniform-BPP,
we derive a new coverage result to enable the analysis of
optimal geographic caching in ﬁnite wireless networks. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst stochastic geometry-
based analysis of cache-enabled ﬁnite D2D networks. This
work has many extensions. From modeling perspective, it can
be extended to an arbitrary shape (instead of a circle) where
the node locations follow a more general distribution. Further,
this framework can be extended to analyze Mat´ern cluster
process where each ﬁnite network form one cluster. From
system perspective, it can be used for the performance analysis
of indoor communication and hotspots, where the analyses
