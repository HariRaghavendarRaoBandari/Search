We present several criteria for genuine multipartite entanglement from universal uncertainty re-
lations based on majorization theory. Under non-negative Schur-concave functions, the vector-type
uncertainty relation generates a family of inﬁnitely many detectors to check genuine multipartite
entanglement. We also introduce the concept of k-separable circles via geometric distance for prob-
ability vectors, which include at most (k − 1)-separable states. The entanglement witness is also
generalized to a universal entanglement witness which is able to detect the k-separable states more
accurately.

INTRODUCTION

Entanglement is one of the key characteristics of quantum theory and has been a source for new computational
methods and algorithms in quantum information theory. Numerous criteria of entanglement have been discovered for
pure and mixed quantum states, and many of them are devoted to entanglement of bipartite states. For a multipartite
system, separability can be classiﬁed into k-separability [1] and the quantum state is called genuinely entangled if it
is not separable with respect to any tensor bipartition of its space (see Sect. III C for detailed deﬁnition). Due to
the importance of genuine entanglement, numerous approaches have been devoted to detecting genuinely multipartite
entanglement. Among the inﬂuential ones, the methods using entanglement witness [2–9], generalized concurrence
[10–14], and Bell-inequality [15] are very useful. Nevertheless, the problem of detecting genuinely entanglement is far
from being solved.

The principle behind the entanglement witnesses is that entanglement of multiparity quantum states gives rise to
nonlocal correlations of measurement observers, whose measurement outcomes obey certain bounds. In particular the
lower bound of the uncertainty relation is expected to provide better entanglement witnesses. In this paper, we use
the universal uncertainty relation and majorization theory to derive further criteria for k-separability and genuine
entanglement.

We take mixed three-qubit states as an example to explain our approach to entanglement using majorization. In
[16], mixed three-qubit states have been classiﬁed into three classes of genuine three-qubit entanglement (W-type,
GHZ-type), biseparable and fully separable states. Our approach not only gives a new method to detect entanglement,
but also provides a ﬁne tuned devise to further classify biseparable states into three subclasses of AB − C, A − BC,
and AC − B types. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a universal entanglement witness and derive its canonical
form, which can be used to picture layers of k-separability [1] as concentric circles.

The principle behind our majorization method is to use uncertainty relations to detect entanglement. In the original
Heisenberg-Robertson [17, 18] uncertainty principle, the lower bound of the product of standard deviations of two
incompatible observables A and B is given by

∆A · ∆B (cid:62) 1
2

|(cid:104)[A, B](cid:105)|,

(1)

where ∆A is the standard deviation of A respect to the quantum state ϕ. Usually the uncertainty relations in terms
of standard deviations is state-dependent (but see [19]).

Entropy has been used as a measurement [20] for the uncertainty principle. Deutsch [21] showed that the lower

bound of the entropy uncertainty relation (EUR) in a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space is

Other uncertainty relations and improvements have been given in [22] and [23], where the lower bound are mostly
state-independent and computable from two probability vectors. Good surveys for these bounds can be found in
[24–31].

The universality of the information-based uncertainty principle gives a unbreakable lower bound that holds in
general. In fact, the uncertainty relations can be quantiﬁed by majorization [32], which has numerous advantages
over previous formulations. The universal uncertainty relation (UUR) based on majorization was found in [33, 34]

p(ρ) ⊗ q(ρ) ≺ ω,

∀ ρ,

(3)

where ρ is any mixed state on a ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space and ω is a certain probability vector independent
of ρ. Here the majorization ’≺ ’ is certain partial order among real vectors [35] (see section 2 for deﬁnition). In the
following we will also generalize the UUR principle to other situations and use them to give new entanglement tests
for k-separability.

The paper is roughly organized as follows. First we review some basic backgrounds of majorization theory and the
UUR in Sect. 2. Then we prove a universal lower bound for partial separable states and use the lower bound to give
criteria for genuine entanglement and k-separability. Finally we discuss the matrix form of majorization and how it
is used to provide better tests for entanglement of multipartite mixed states.

Here Ik are k-element subsets of [d] × [d] and [d] = {1, 2, . . . , d}. The outer maximum is over all subsets Ik and the

Mixed states of three-qubit systems can be classiﬁed by the following: (1) the convex hull S of separable states;
(2) the convex hull B of biseparable states (AB-C, AC-B and BC-A); (3) the convex hull of all states, including
S, B and genuinely entangled states (W-states and GHZ-states). All these sets are compact and convex, satisfy
S ⊂ B ⊂ W ⊂ GHZ (see FIG 1.). Examples of GHZ witness and W witness had been given in [16].

III. ENTANGLEMENT DETECTION

ρ =(cid:80) piρi

As shown in [32], the universal uncertainty relation can reach its bound on pure states. One can use this to
establish an entanglement detector to check whether a density matrix is separable by proving a condition satisﬁed
by all separable states. The method of using universal uncertainty relations, however, has a limit to detect genuine
entanglement. In this section, we utilize the Lagrange multiplier to show that the universal uncertainty bound of
C can also be reached by the pure state of the form ρAB ⊗ ρC, which provides a AB-C biseparable
detector. This establishes a biseparable detector of all tripartite states in AB-C, AC-B or BC-A, and more generally,
it can be generalized to give a k-separable detector for all n-partite states.

(18)

If the probability vector of ρ violates the majorization relation, then ρ is entangled but not biseparable of type AB-C.
If the dimensions of HA, HB and HC are diﬀerent, then the majorization uncertainty bounds ωAB,C, ωAC,B and
ωBC,A are all diﬀerent under a suitable measurement {X, EX
α }. These probability vectors and that of the whole space
form a lattice (see FIG 2), which leads to a majorization uncertainty bound to control any two of ωAB,C, ωAC,B and
ωBC,A.
[Proposition 1]. If ωAB,C (cid:54)= ωAC,B and both ≺≺ (1, 0,··· , 0), then there exists a unique probability vector ω23 such
that

ωAB,C ≺ ω23,
ωAC,B ≺ ω23,

ω23 ≺≺ (1, 0,··· , 0),

and majorizied by any other vector with property Eq. (19). This vector is also denoted by max{ωAB,C, ωAC,B}.

To study genuine entanglement, we consider both ω23 and ωBC,A and denote the unique probability vector

max{ω23, ωBC,A} by ω123. The following result gives a criterion for genuine entanglement.
[Theorem 2]. If

P X (ρ) ⊀ ω123,

(21)

then ρ can not be biseparable, and ρ is genuinely entangled.

For any measurement Φ of uncertainty (non-negative Schur-concave function), it follows from P X (ρ) ≺ ω123 that

Φ(P X (ρ)) (cid:62) Φ(ω123).

One can use uncertainty measurements to give numerical criteria for genuine entanglement.

[Corollary 1]. If there is an uncertainty measurement Φ such that

Φ(P X (ρ)) < Φ(ω123),

(22)

(23)

If HA, HB and HC have the same dimension, then ωAB,C = ωAC,B = ωBC,A = ω123 by the symmetry property of

Combining with non-negative Schur-concave functions, one immediately gets the following criterion of genuine

entanglement.
[Corollary 2]. If there is a non-negative Schur-concave function Φ such that

Φ(P X (ρ)) < Φ(ωAB,C),

(25)

then ρ is not biseparable state, and the state ρ is genuinely entangled.

C. Entanglement Detection in Multipartite States

section, we present a general and systematic scheme to study k-separable and n-partite genuinely entangled states.

The majorization method can be generalized to characterize entanglement for multipartite quantum states. In this
Following [3], we say a pure n-partite quantum state |Ψ(cid:105) is k-separable if it can be written as

(26)
where |φi(cid:105) is a single subsystem or a group of subsystems. If such as decomposition is not possible, |Ψ(cid:105) is called
genuinely n-partite entangled. For a mixed state ρ: a state is genuinely k-partite entangled if any decomposition into
pure states

|Ψ(cid:105) = |φ1(cid:105) ⊗ |φ2(cid:105) ⊗ ··· ⊗ |φk(cid:105),

ρ =

pi|ψi(cid:105)(cid:104)ψi|,

(27)

with probabilities pi > 0 contains at least one genuinely k-partite entangled component. It is called k-separable if any
decomposition into pure states |ψi(cid:105) is at least k-separable. All (k + 1)-separable states form a compact and convex
subset of the set of k-separable states. This hierarchical structure is usually referred to as a uniform entanglement
frame. Our main idea is to construct criteria to detect k-separability by majorization uncertainty relations and ﬁnd
the principle behind these criteria.

Statistical mixture of biseparable states for tripartite states has been considered, we now focus on k-separable states

Entangled states are characterized well under the majorization uncertainty relations as the universal uncertainty
bounds are independent from the state ρ. This is particularly so when one applies the uncertainty relations given in
Eq. (2). We discuss some examples to show how these are applied.

by 1/

d, we get that

ωA,B = (1/d, 1/d,··· , 1/d, 0, 0,··· , 0).

Using our Theorem 1, the Werner state is separable if P X (ρwer

IV. MATRIX FORMS OF MAJORIZATION

Majorization was ﬁrst studied by Schur [38] in relation with Hadamard inequalities and it was proved that two

Birkkhoﬀ proved that the set of all bistochastic matrices is the convex hull of permutation matrices [39]. The geometric
and combinatoric principle behind majorization and bistochastic matrix is that the relation fully characterizes the
convexity of the set of all k-separable states. It is a convex and compact subset of (k − 1)-separable states, which
enables one to construct criteria to detect k-separable states. The majorization method to detect states is relied on
the “interior” of the convex set of k-separable states based on Brikhoﬀ’s theorem.

We list the equivalent forms of majorization as follows.
(1) x ≺ y;
(2) y = Q(x) for some bistochastic matrix Q;
(3) Φ(x) (cid:62) Φ(y) for any non-negative Schur-concave functions Φ;
(4) x can be derived from y by successive applications of ﬁnitely many T -transformations:

T = λI + (1 − λ)P,

(38)

where 0 (cid:54) λ (cid:54) 1 and P is a permutation matrix that interchanges two coordinates;

(5) x is in the convex hull of the n! permutations of y.
We now give the matrix form of the k-separable criterion.

[Theorem 5]. Let ρ be an n-partite quantum state on H⊗n (dim(H) = d), and let {X, EX
α } be a measurement with
the probability vector P X (ρ) = (p1, p2,··· , pm), where m = dn. Suppose the k-separable uncertainty bound is
ωk = (Ω1, Ω2 − Ω1, . . . , Ωm − Ωm−1). If there does not exist a bistochastic matrix Q = (qij) such that

m(cid:88)

Ωj − Ωj−1 =

qijpi,

j = 1, 2,··· , m.

then ρ is at most (k − 1)-separable.

i=1

This result follows from the fact that violation of P X (ρ) ≺ ωk is equivalent to there does not exist a bistochastic

matrix Q such that ωk = Q(P X (ρ)).

[Lemma 3]. Let f be a convex function. Then the information quantity Df (x (cid:107) y) =(cid:80)

We now consider an information quantity called f -relative entropy to express the closeness between two probability
vectors and helps describe k-separability. The f -relative entropy is also called f -divergence in information theory [40].

It follows from Lemma 3 that Df (x (cid:107) y) is an f -relative entropy. This monotonicity condition (39) also holds if Q
Note that Q(1/m, 1/m,··· , 1/m) = (1/m, 1/m,··· , 1/m) for any bistochastic matrix. Plugging y = K =

Df (P X (ρ) (cid:107) K) (cid:62) Df (ωk (cid:107) K),

This gives the following criterion of relevant entanglement.

then the state ρ is at most (k − 1)-separable.

The f -relative entropy Df (P X (ρ) (cid:107) K) expresses the closeness between P X (ρ) and a ﬁxed point K, but it does not
such as f (x) = 1 − √
satisfy the axioms of a distance. To get a ’distance’ to characterize k-separability one needs special convex functions
x, its square root is called Hellinger distance and denoted by d2(x, y). It is known that d2(x, y)
satisﬁes the axioms of a distance. With K as the center of the circle, d2(ωk, K) can be viewed as the radius of a
k-separable circle, or simply the k-circle ( see FIG 3.).
[Corollary 5]. If ρ is at most (k − 1)-separable, then

d2(P X (ρ), K) < d2(ωk, K).

(42)

The vector P X (ρ) ∈ Rm is a point inside the k-separable circle.

Hellinger distance is useful to detect entanglement based on the monotonicity condition. However, only the mono-

tonicity property is not good enough for entanglement detection, which is shown by the following example.
[Example 4]. Consider the variational distance given by

(cid:88)

d1(x, y) =

|xi − yi|.

It is not an f-relative entropy, but it satisﬁes the monotonicity property
d1(x, y) (cid:62) d1(Q(x), Q(y)).

If we take y as K = (1/m,··· , 1/m) then d1(x, y) = d1(Q(x), Q(y)). Thus d1 fails to detect entanglement.
Finally we would like to discuss how entanglement witness is used to detect entanglement. A witness for genuine k-
partite entanglement is an observable that has a positive expectation value on states with (k− 1)-partite entanglement
and a negative expectation value on some k-partite entangled states. Entanglement witness is a useful tool for
analyzing entanglement in experiments [37]. Usual entanglement witness does have its limit in dealing with the
type of k-partite separable state. We now give a universal entanglement witness which can detect the type. We
take tripartite states to illustrate the idea. Suppose ρ ∈ HA ⊗ HB ⊗ HC and dim HA (cid:54)= dim HB (cid:54)= dim HC. By
choosing a suitable measurement {X, EX
α }, the bounds ωAB,C, ωAC,B and ωBC,A are all diﬀerent. Write ωAB,C as
(Ω1, Ω2 − Ω1, . . . , Ωm − Ωm−1), m = dim HA · dim HB · dim HC.

A universal witness operator can be written in the canonical form

T r(Wkρ) < 0,

(48)

(49)

for some k, then ρ can not be of type AB-C. We remark that the universal entanglement witness can be used to
analyze the complement of the compact convex subset inside another one.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

10

In this paper, we have developed entanglement criteria based on both majorization and universal uncertainty
relations. These criteria have advantage over the scalar detecting algorithms as they are often stronger and tighter
due to speciﬁc formulas for the bound ω of the uncertainty relation. They are tight enough to detect k-separable
n-partite states and their types by choosing a suitable measurement {X, EX
α } when the underlying particles have
diﬀerent dimensions.

We have also presented the matrix form of majorization. One feature in this approach is by choosing a suitable
monotonic function one can deﬁne a distance in the set of entangled states, where k-separable states form concentric
circles. In this regard, viable functions are non-negative Schur-concave functions such as Shannon, R´enyi and Tsallis
entropies [41, 42]. We have also generalized the entanglement witness to detect the type of a k-separable state, and
indicate how they can be implemented in experiments.
