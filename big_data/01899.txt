Abstract

In this paper we consider the problem of characterizing the minimum energy con-
ﬁgurations of a ﬁnite system of particles interacting between them due to attracting
or repulsive forces given by a certain inter molecular potential. We limit ourselves to
the cases of three particles arranged in a triangular array and that of four particles in
a tetrahedral array. The minimization is constrained to ﬁxed area in the case of the
triangular array, and to ﬁxed volume in the tetrahedral case. For a general class of
inter molecular potentials we give conditions for the homogeneous conﬁguration (either
an equilateral triangle or a regular tetrahedron) of the array to be stable, that is, a
minimizer of the potential energy of the system. To determine whether or not there
exist other stable states, the system of ﬁrst order necessary conditions for a minimum
is treated as a bifurcation problem with the area or volume variable as the bifurca-
tion parameter. Because of the symmetries present in our problem, we can apply the
techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory to show that there exist branches of non–
homogeneous solutions bifurcating from the trivial branch of homogeneous solutions
at precisely the values of the parameter of area or volume for which the homogeneous
conﬁguration changes stability. For the triangular array, we construct numerically the
bifurcation diagrams for both a Lennard–Jones and Buckingham potentials. The nu-
merics show that there exist non–homogeneous stable states, multiple stable states for
intervals of values of the area parameter, and secondary bifurcations as well.

Introduction

Consider a system of N molecules, modeled as identical spherical particles, enclosed in a
region B. At any given instant (or in an equilibrium conﬁguration), the total potential
energy of the molecular array is given by:

E =Xi<j

φ(k~ri − ~rjk),

(1.1)

where φ is the inter molecular potential energy and ~r1, . . . ,~rN are the positions of the parti-
cles. In this paper we consider the problem of characterizing the minimum energy conﬁgura-
tions of this functional in the case of three particles (N = 3) arranged in a triangle and that
of four particles (N = 4) in a tetrahedral array. The minimization problem is subject to the
constraint of ﬁxed area for the triangular array and of ﬁxed volume in the tetrahedral case.
We are particularly interested on the dependence of the minimizing states on the parameter
of area or volume in the constraint. Both of these problems have the particularity that they
can be formulated in terms of the inter–molecular distances only, that is, without specifying
the coordinates corresponding to the positions of the particles, thus substantially reducing
the number of unknowns in each problem.

The motivation for this problem comes from the following phenomena observed both
in laboratory experiments and molecular dynamics simulations (see e.g.
[3], [5]). As the
density of a ﬂuid is progressively lowered (keeping the temperature constant), there is a
certain “critical” density such that if the density of the ﬂuid is lower than this critical
value, then bubbles or regions with very low density appear within the ﬂuid. When using
discrete models of materials like (1.1), distinguishing between regions of low vs high density,
or whether bubbles or holes have form within the array, is not obvious since one is dealing
essentially with a set of points. Thus to study this phenomena within this discrete model,
one is naturally led to study or characterize the stability of homogeneous energy minimizing
conﬁgurations of such an array, as the density of the the array changes. The problems
considered in this paper are the simplest problems within such a model.

The problem of minimizing (1.1) subject to certain type of global or local conditions have
been studied extensively (see e.g.
[7], [8], [9] and the references there in). In these models
either the array is inﬁnite, with some local repeating structure, or ﬁnite but with N → ∞.
In our problem none of these conditions are required but we expect that our results can be
extrapolated to such more general scenarios. Also we do not commit to any particular inter
molecular potential φ so that our results are applicable to any such smooth potential.

In Section 3 we consider the problem of three particles. By Heron’s formula for the
area of a triangle, any three numbers (representing the inter–molecular distances) that yield
a positive value for the area formula, represent a triangle. In this case we show that the

2

functional (1.1) subject to the constraint of ﬁxed area A, has for any value of A, a critical
point representing an equilateral triangle. Moreover, in Theorem 3.2 we give a necessary and
suﬃcient condition (cf. (3.12)), in terms of the inter–molecular potential, for this equilibrium
point to be a (local) minimizer of the energy functional. This condition leads to a set of
values A for the area parameter A for which the equilateral triangle is a stable conﬁguration.
We give examples of how this set looks for various inter–molecular potentials including the
classical Lennard–Jones and Buckingham potentials, and those that model hard and soft
springs including the usual Hooke’s law.

Next in Section 3.2 we turn to the question of whether there exists other (not equilateral)
equilibrium conﬁgurations for those values of the area parameter A for which the equilateral
triangle becomes unstable, that is, when it ceases to be a local minimizer. To answer this
question, we treat the system of equations characterizing the equilibrium points (cf. (3.3))
as a bifurcation problem with the parameter A as a bifurcation parameter, and the set of
equilateral equilibrium conﬁgurations as the trivial solution branch. We ﬁnd that the nec-
essary condition for bifurcation from the trivial branch for this system occurs exactly at the
boundary points of the set A given by the stability condition (3.12). To check the suﬃciency
condition for bifurcation, one must consider the linearization of the system (3.3) about the
trivial branch at a boundary point A0 of A. However since the kernel of this linearization is
two dimensional we can not immediately apply the usual or standard results from bifurcation
theory. Because of the symmetries present in this problem (cf (3.22)), we can apply bifur-
cation equivariant theory to construct a suitable reduced problem corresponding to isosceles
triangular equilibrium conﬁgurations. The linearization of the reduced problem at the point
where A = A0 has now a one dimensional kernel and provided that a certain transversality
condition is satisﬁed (cf. (3.24)), we can show that there are three branches corresponding to
isosceles triangles bifurcating from the trivial branch at the point where A = A0. Since the
stability of these bifurcating branches can only be determine numerically (because one must
linearized about an unknown solution), in Section 5 we construct numerically the bifurcation
diagrams, with their respective stability patterns, for instances of the Lennard–Jones and
Buckingham potentials. These examples show that the primary bifurcations oﬀ the trivial
branch are of trans–critical type, and that at least for the Lennard–Jones potential, there
are secondary bifurcations corresponding to stable scalene triangles. Moreover, there are
intervals of values of the area parameter, for which there exists multiple stable states of the
system for each value of A in such an interval.

In Section 4 we consider an array of four molecules in a tetrahedron. The general treat-
ment in this case is similar to the three particle case but with two main diﬀerences. First the
characterization of when six numbers (representing the lengths of the sides of the tetrahe-
dron) determine a tetrahedron, is given in terms of the Cayley-Menger determinant and the
triangle inequalities of one of its faces (cf. (4.1), (4.2)). The next complication arises from

3

the fact that the tetrahedron has 24 symmetries as compared to only six for the triangle! To
deal with this many possibilities, once again we make use of the basic techniques of equiv-
ariant theory ([10]) to get suitable reduced problems to work with. As the Cayley–Menger
determinant is proportional to the volume of the corresponding tetrahedron, the volume
constraint in our problem is basically that of setting this determinant to a given value V
for the volume. In this case we show in Section 4.1 that the functional (1.1) subject to the
constraint of ﬁxed volume V , has for any value of V a critical point representing a regular
or equilateral tetrahedron. Moreover, in Theorem 4.2 we give necessary and suﬃcient con-
ditions (cf. (4.9)), in terms of the inter–molecular potential, for this equilibrium point to
be a (local) minimizer of the energy functional. As for the triangular case, these conditions
determine a set of values V for the volume parameter V for which the equilateral tetrahedron
is a stable conﬁguration.
In Section 4.2 we consider the question of the existence of non–equilateral equilibrium
conﬁgurations. The equilibrium conﬁgurations in this case are given as solutions to a non-
linear system of seven equations in eight unknowns (cf. (4.6)). We treat this system as a
bifurcation problem with the parameter V as a bifurcation parameter, and the set of equilat-
eral tetrahedrons as the trivial solution branch. The necessary condition for bifurcation from
the trivial branch for this system occurs exactly at the boundary points of the set V given
by the stability conditions (4.9). At a boundary point V0 of V there are two possibilities:
the kernel of the linearization has dimension two or three. Using some of the machinery
of equivariance theory as in [10], we can construct suitable reduced problems in each of
these two cases, which enables us to establish the existence of non-equilateral equilibrium
conﬁgurations and to get a full description of the symmetries of the bifurcating branches
(cf. Theorems 4.7, 4.9, 4.11). As in the triangular case, the stability of this bifurcating
branches can only be established numerically because one must linearize about the unknown
bifurcating branch.

Notation: We let Rn denote the n dimensional space of column vectors with elements
denoted by ~x, ~y,. . . The inner product of ~x, ~y ∈ Rn is denoted either by h~x, ~yi or ~xt~y, where
the superscript “t” denotes transpose. We denote the set of n × m matrices by Rn×m. For
L ∈ Rn×m, we let ker(L) = {~x ∈ Rn : L~x = ~0} and Range(L) = {L~x : ~x ∈ Rn}. For a
function ~F : Rn → Rm, we denote its Fr´echet derivative by D~F which is given by the m × n
matrix of partial derivatives of the components of ~F. If the variables in ~F are given by (~x, ~y),
then D~x

~F denotes the derivative of ~F with respect to the vector of variables ~x, etc.

2 Equivariant bifurcation from a simple eigenvalue

In this section we provide an overview on some of the basic results on bifurcation theory
from a simple eigenvalue for mappings between ﬁnite dimensional spaces, where the maps
posses certain symmetries. The literature on this subject is extensive but we refer to [9], [2],
and [13] for details on the material presented in this section and further developments like
for instance, the inﬁnite dimensional case.

Let ~F : U × R → Rn where U is an open subset of Rn, be a C 2 function, and consider

the problem of characterizing the solution set of:

~F(~x, A) = ~0,

(~x, A) ∈ U × R.

(2.1)

We assume that there exists a (known) smooth function ~g(·) such that:

~F(~g(A), A) = ~0,

∀ A.

The set T = {(~g(A), A) : A ∈ R} is called the trivial branch of solutions of (2.1). We say
that (~x0, A0) ∈ T is a bifurcation point oﬀ the trivial branch T , if every neighborhood of
(~x0, A0) contains solutions of (2.1) not in T . If we let

L(A) = D~x

~F(~g(A), A),

then by the Implicit Function Theorem, a necessary for (~x0, A0) to be a bifurcation point is
that L(A0) has to be singular, a condition well known to be not suﬃcient.

In many applications of bifurcation theory and for the problems considered in this paper,
the mapping ~F posses symmetries due to the geometry of the underlying physical problem.
The use of these symmetries in the analysis is useful for example to deal with problems
in which dim ker(L(A0)) > 1. Thus we assume that for a proper subgroup G of Rn×n,
characterizing the symmetries in the problem, the mapping ~F satisﬁes:

~F(P ~x, A) = P ~F(~x, A),

∀ P ∈ G.

Let ~v ∈ ker(L(A0)) and deﬁne the isotropy subgroup of G at ~v by

H = {P ∈ G : P ~v = ~v} ,

and the H–ﬁxed point set by
Rn

H = {~x ∈ Rn : P ~x = ~x, ∀P ∈ H} .

Clearly ~v ∈ Rn
H.

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

Let PH : Rn → Rn be a linear map that projects onto Rn
H) = Rn

H. With UH = PH(U) = U ∩ Rn

H, we deﬁne ~FH : UH × R → Rn

PH(Rn

H, that is Range(PH) = Rn

H and

H by:

~FH(~u, A) = PH~F(~u, A),

(~u, A) ∈ UH × R.

(2.5)

An easy calculation now gives that

D~u

~FH(~u, A) = PH~F~x(~u, A)PH.

We assume that ~g(A) ∈ Rn

H for all A, so that

~FH(~g(A), A) = ~0,

∀ A.

It follows now that LH(A) : Rn

H is given by:

H → Rn
LH(A) = D~u

~FH(~g(A), A) = PHL(A)PH.

Clearly ~v ∈ ker(LH(A0)). The H–reduced problem is now given by:

~FH(~u, A) = ~0,

(~u, A) ∈ UH × R.

(2.6)

An important property relating (2.1) and (2.6) is that (~x, A) ∈ UH× R is a solution of (2.1) if
and only if (~x, A) is a solution of (2.6). The following result provides the required suﬃcient
conditions for (~x0, A0) to be a bifurcation point of the H–reduced problem.
Theorem 2.1 (Equivariant Bifurcation Theorem [11]). Assume that for A = A0 there exists
~v ∈ ker(L(A0)) that deﬁnes a proper isotropy subgroup H such that:

ker(LH(A0)) = span{~v} , L′

H(A0)~v /∈ Range(LH(A0)).

Then there exists a branch CH of nontrivial solutions of ~FH(~u, A) = ~0 bifurcating from the
trivial branch T at the point where A = A0 and such that either:
i) CH is unbounded in Rn+1;
ii) the closure of CH intersects the boundary ∂U of U;
iii) CH intersects T at a point (~x∗, A∗) where A∗ 6= A0.

6

The proof of this theorem is basically an application of a result from Krasnoselski [14]
that uses the homotopy invariance of the topological degree. The three alternatives in the
statement of the theorem are usually referred to as the Crandall and Rabinowitz alterna-
tives. The local version of this result (cf. [9]), that is, without the Crandall and Rabinowitz
alternatives, can be obtained via the Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction method. A useful con-
sequence of this reduction is an approximate formula for the bifurcating branch in a neigh-
borhood of the bifurcation point. Let ker(LH(A0)t) = span{~v∗}, where h~v∗, ~vi = 1, so that
Range(LH(A0)) = {~y ∈ Rn

H : h~v∗, ~yi = 0}. Now if we deﬁne
~F0
H~v)~vi, B0 = h~v∗, L′

A0 = h~v∗, (D~u~u

H(A0)~vi.

(2.7)

(here the zero superscripts mean evaluated at (~x0, A0)), then the bifurcating branch have
the following asymptotic expansion:

where

(~x, A) =(cid:2)~g(A0 + ε) + εm~v + O(ε2), A0 + ε(cid:3) ,

m = −

2B0
A0 , A0 6= 0.

3 The three particle case

In this section we consider the case in which the molecular array consists of three particles.
The inter–particle energy is given by a smooth function φ : (0,∞) → R called the potential.
If (a, b, c) are the distances between the particles in the array, the total energy of the system
is given by:

E(a, b, c) = φ(a) + φ(b) + φ(c),

a, b, c > 0.

(3.1)

Also, the square of the area of the triangular array is given by Heron’s formula:

g(a, b, c) ≡ s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c),

where s = (a + b + c)/2.

For any any given number A > 0, we consider the following constrained minimization

problem:

(

min
a,b,c>0

E(a, b, c)

subject to g(a, b, c) = A2.

(3.2)

Thus we are looking for minimizers of the energy functional E subject to the constraint that
the area of the array is A. The ﬁrst order necessary conditions for a solution of this problem

7

are given by:

(cid:26)

g(a, b, c) − A2 = 0,
~∇E(a, b, c) + λ~∇g(a, b, c) = ~0,

where λ ∈ R is the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the restriction g(a, b, c) = A2.
For any given value of A > 0, this is a nonlinear system of equations for the unknowns
(λ, a, b, c) in terms of A. In general this system can have multiple solutions depending on
the characteristics of the potential φ and the value of A.

3.1 Existence and stability of trivial states

An easy calculation shows that:

~∇E =

 .

Thus the system (3.3) is equivalent to:

1

8(a2b2 + a2c2 + b2c2) − 1

16 (a4 + b4 + c4) − A2 = 0,
4 a(b2 + c2 − a2) = 0,
4 b(a2 + c2 − b2) = 0,
4 c(a2 + b2 − c2) = 0.

This system always has a solution with a = b = c. In fact upon setting a = b = c in (3.5),
this system reduces to:

Thus we have the following result:

We now characterize for which values of A, the solution provided in Lemma 3.6 is ac-
tually a minimizer, i.e., a solution of (3.2). To do this we need to examine the matrix
[∇2E + λ∇2g] (~vA) where ~vA = (λA, aA, aA, aA), over the subspace:
M =n(x, y, z) : ~∇g(~vA) · (x, y, z) = 0o .

It follows now that

and that

Using (3.7) one can show now that the matrix (3.11) is positive deﬁnite over M if and only
if:

φ′(aA) > 0.

(3.12)

Thus we have the following result:

φ′′(aA) +

Theorem 3.2. Let φ : (0,∞) → R be twice continuously diﬀerentiable function. Then the
uniform array (a, b, c) = (aA, aA, aA) in Lemma 3.1 is a relative minimizer for the problem
(3.2) for those values of A for which (3.12) holds.

Example 3.3. Consider the case of a potential that has the following form:

φ(r) =

c1
rδ1 −

c2
rδ2

,

(3.13)

where c1, c2 are positive constants and δ1 > δ2 > 2. (These constants determine the physical
properties of the particle or molecule in question. The classical Lennard–Jones [15] potential
is obtained upon setting δ1 = 12 and δ2 = 6.) For this function:

φ′(r) = −

c1δ1
rδ1+1 +

c2δ2
rδ2+1 , φ′′(r) =

c1δ1(δ1 + 1)

,

so that:

φ′′(r) +

φ′(r) =

c1δ1(δ1 − 2)

rδ1+2

c2δ2(δ2 − 2)

Since aA es directly proportional to √A (see (3.7)), we have that for (3.13), the stability
condition (3.12) holds if and only if A < A0, where A0 is determined from the condition:

from which it follows that:

c1δ1(δ1 − 2)

A0 =

c2δ2(δ2 − 2)(cid:21)

δ1−δ2

.

(3.14)

Thus (3.7) is a (local) solution of (3.2) if and only if A < A0. We will show that for A > A0
there exist solutions that break the symmetry a = b = c.

Example 3.4. A Buckingham potential has the form ([6], [16]):

φ(r) = αe−βr −

γ
rη ,

(3.15)

where α, β, γ, η are positive constants. Thus

φ′(r) = −αβe−βr +

γη
rη+1 , φ′′(r) = αβ 2e−βr −

γη(η + 1)

rη+2

,

from which it follows that:

φ′′(r) +

3
r

φ′(r) = αβ(cid:20)β −

3

r(cid:21) e−βr −

γη(η − 2)

rη+2

.

After rearrangement, the stability condition (3.12) is equivalent to:

F (aA) > G(aA),

(3.16)

where

F (r) = αβ(βr − 3)e−βr, G(r) =

γη(η − 2)

rη+1

.

These functions generically look as in Figure 1 where for G we assumed that η > 2. Now
clearly F (r) < G(r) for r suﬃciently large. Thus generically we expect the set of values
of A for which (3.16) is satisﬁed to be of the form (A0, A1). Since F has a maximum at
rm = 4
β , a suﬃcient condition for this is that F (rm) > G(rm), or after rearrangement, that
the coeﬃcients and exponents in (3.15) satisfy:

αβe−4 > γη(η − 2)(cid:18)β

ξ − η (cid:18) R

Is easy to check now that provided ξ > η + 1, then φ has negative minimum value at r = R.
The results in [16, Table 1, Page 202] show that the best ﬁt of a normalized Buckingham
potential to a normalized Lennard–Jones(12-6) potential (δ1 = 12 and δ2 = 6 in (3.13)) is
achieved for ξ = 14.3863 and η = 5.6518. For these values one can check that (3.18) satisfy
the inequality (3.17) independent of the values of D and R.

Example 3.5. Consider a potential of the form

φ(r) =

βr4.

a soft spring if β < 0. For this potential

φ′′(r) +

φ′(r) = 4k + 6βr2.

Note that the stability condition (3.12) holds when β ≥ 0 independent of the value of A!
That is, the symmetric state (3.7) is a minimizer for all values of A. In the case β = 0 is
easy to show that this state is a global minimizer.

On the other hand, if β < 0, the stability condition holds if and only if A < A0 where

A0 = −

3.2 Existence and stability of nontrivial solutions

We say that solutions of (3.3) are trivial if a = b = c and call the set

T = {(λA, aA, aA, aA, A) : λA, aA given by (3.7), A > 0} ,

(3.20)

the trivial branch parametrized by A. In this section we show that there exist nontrivial
solutions of (3.3) that bifurcate from the trivial branch.

If we let ~x = (λ, a, b, c) and ~G : R × (0,∞)4 → R4 be the left hand side of (3.5), then

this system is equivalent to ~G(~x, A) = ~0. An easy calculation gives that

~G(~x, A) =(cid:20) 0

which are always nonzero. A pair of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to α−β
is {(0,−1, 1, 0)t, (0,−1, 0, 1)t}. Since

α − β = φ′′(aA) −

A = φ′′(aA) +

φ′(aA),

the double eigenvalue α−β becomes zero exactly at the value A0 where the stability condition
(3.12) fails by becoming zero. Thus according to standard theory of bifurcation theory, we
can have either none, two or four branches of solutions of (3.5) bifurcating at the point where
A = A0. We now show that there are exactly four branches bifurcating from such a point:
the trivial branch and three branches corresponding to isosceles triangles.

To avoid the complications of dealing with the two dimensional kernel of (3.21) when
evaluated at the trivial branch at A = A0, we make use of the symmetries posses by the
mapping ~G. In particular, if we denote by G the subgroup of R4×4 of permutations that
permute just the a.b.c components of any ~x = (λ, a, b, c) ∈ R4, then

~G(P ~x, A) = P ~G(~x, A),

∀ P ∈ G.

(3.22)

Note that every permutation in G changes the eigenvectors {(0,−1, 1, 0)t, (0,−1, 0, 1)t} of
α − β. However, the eigenvector

~v ≡ (0,−2, 1, 1)t = (0,−1, 1, 0)t + (0,−1, 0, 1)t,

is unchanged by the proper subgroup of permutations H of G that permutes just the b, c
components of any ~x = (λ, a, b, c) ∈ R4. Thus H is the isotropy subgroup of G at ~v. The H
ﬁxed point set is given by:

Since T ⊂ R4
Also, since

Let

φ′(aA).

(3.23)

We now have the result for the existence of bifurcating branches for the reduced problem.

Theorem 3.6. Let µ(A0) = 0 and assume that

dµ
dA

(A0) 6= 0.

(3.24)

Consider the system (3.3) and its trivial branch of solutions (3.20). Then from the point
(λ0, a0, a0, a0) ∈ T bifurcate three branches of nontrivial solutions of (3.3) each corresponding
to isosceles triangles.

Proof : With the deﬁnitions and notation as above, a lengthy but otherwise elementary
calculation shows that for any A > 0, µ(A) is a simple eigenvalue of LH(A) restricted to R4
with corresponding eigenvector ~v = (0,−2, 1, 1)t. Thus

H

In particular ker(LH(A0)) = span{~v}. If we diﬀerentiate with respect to A in the equation
above and set A = A0, we get that

LH(A)~v = µ(A)~v,

∀ A > 0.

L′

H(A0)~v = µ′(A0)~v.

Since LH(A0) is symmetric, we have that Range(LH(A0)) = {~y ∈ Rn
H : h~v, ~yi = 0}. Thus
the hypotheses in Theorem 2.1 are satisﬁed if and only if µ′(A0) 6= 0. Thus we get a branch of
solutions of the reduced problem, equivalently (3.5), bifurcating from the trivial branch at the
point where A = A0. Since this branch belongs to R4
H× R, we can use (3.22) to get that there
exist two additional branches of solutions, one belonging to {(λ, b, a, b, A)t : λ, a, b, A ∈ R}
and the other in {(λ, b, b, a, A)t : λ, a, b, A ∈ R}.

4 Four particles in a tetrahedron

We now consider the case of four particles arranged in a tetrahedron T . Let a, b, c, A, B, C
be the distances between the particles where a, b, c denote the lengths of the edges joining a
vertex of T , A the length of the edge opposite to a, B the length of the edge opposite to b,
and C the length of the edge opposite to c. The six–tuple ~a = (a, b, c, A, B, C)t generates a
tetrahedron ([17]) if and only if

g(~a) > 0, A < B + C, B < A + C, C < A + B,

(4.1)

where g(~a) is given by the Cayley–Menger determinant:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(4.2)

If we let R+ denote the set of positive real numbers, then we deﬁne

S =(cid:8)~a = (a, b, c, A, B, C)t ∈ R6

+ : (4.1) holds(cid:9) .

Note that S is open in R6. Moreover, any regular tetrahedron in which a = b = c = A =
B = C > 0, is contained in S.

If ~a = (a, b, c, A, B, C)t generates a tetrahedron, then so does P~a where P = RQ and

i) R permutes (a, b, c) and (A, B, C) with the same permutation of three elements;

ii) Q is any permutation of (a, b, c, A, B, C) in which the base of the tetrahedron is changed
to another face. For example (c, A, B, C, a, b) corresponds to reorienting the tetrahedron
so that the base is given by (C, a, b).

Since there are six permutations of the type R and four of the type Q, we get that there are
24 permutations of the form P = RQ. These 24 permutations form a subgroup R of the
group of permutations of six letters. Also is easy to show that

g(P~a) = g(~a),

∀ P ∈ R.

(4.3)

As the Cayley–Menger determinant is directly proportional to the square of the volume of
the tetrahedron (cf. (4.5)), this identity simply states that the volume of the tetrahedron

15

remains the same after rotations of the base and independent of which face we use as the
base.

The total energy of the the system of four particles is given now by:

E(~a) = φ(a) + φ(b) + φ(c) + φ(A) + φ(B) + φ(C),

(4.4)

where the inter–molecular potential φ is as before. For any V > 0 we consider the constrained
minimization problem:

(

min

S

E(~a)

subject to g(~a) = 288V 2.

(4.5)

The constraint here speciﬁes that the tetrahedron determined by ~a has volume V . The ﬁrst
order necessary conditions for a solution of this problem are given by1:

(cid:26)

g(~a) − 288V 2 = 0,
~∇E(~a) + λ~∇g(~a) = ~0,

(4.6)

which is now a nonlinear system for the seven unknowns (λ, ~a) in terms of the parameter V .

4.1 Existence and stability of trivial states

Expanding the determinant in (4.2) and computing its partial derivatives, we get that

~∇g(~a) = 4(cid:2)a(A2(b2 + c2 + B2 + C 2 − 2a2 − A2) + (b2 − c2)(B2 − C 2)),
b(B2(a2 + c2 + A2 + C 2 − 2b2 − B2) + (a2 − c2)(A2 − C 2)),
c(C 2(a2 + b2 + A2 + B2 − 2c2 − C 2) + (a2 − b2)(A2 − B2)),
A(a2(b2 + c2 + B2 + C 2 − 2A2 − a2) − (b2 − C 2)(c2 − B2)),
B(b2(a2 + c2 + A2 + C 2 − 2B2 − b2) − (a2 − C 2)(c2 − A2)),
C(c2(a2 + b2 + A2 + B2 − 2C 2 − c2) − (a2 − B2)(b2 − A2))(cid:3)

Since ~∇E(~a) = (φ′(a), φ′(b), φ′(c), φ′(A), φ′(B), φ′(C))t, the system (4.6) when evaluated at
the regular tetrahedron ~a = (a, a, a, a, a, a), reduces to

4a6 = 288V 2, φ′(a) + 4λa5 = 0.

This proves the following result.

1Since the inequality constraints in the deﬁnition of the set S are strict (non–active), the multipliers

corresponding to these constraints are zero.

16

Lemma 4.1. For any V > 0 the system (4.6) has the solution (λV , ~aV , V ) where ~aV =

where

Since ~∇g(~aV ) = 4a5

M =(cid:8)~y ∈ R6 : y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 + y6 = 0(cid:9) .

We have now the following result:
Theorem 4.2. Let φ : (0,∞) → R be twice continuously diﬀerentiable function. Then the
matrix (4.8) is positive deﬁnite over M if and only if α > 0 and α − 2β > 0, which in turn
are equivalent to

φ′′(aV ) +

φ′(aV ) > 0,

φ′(aV ) > 0.

(4.9)

Thus the regular tetrahedron ~aV is a relative minimizer for the problem (4.5) for those values
of V for which conditions (4.9) hold.

The matrix corresponding to the quadratic form of HV restricted to M is now given by
UV = M tHV M. The eigenvalues of UV are:

1

2h7α − 6β ±p16α2 + 9(α − 2β)2i .

α (double), α − 2β,

Since the product of the last two of these eigenvalues is 6α(α − 2β), and 7α − 6β = 3(α −
2β) + 4α, we can conclude now that they are all positive if and only if α > 0 and α− 2β > 0.
Thus HV restricted to M is positive deﬁnite provided these two conditions hold, which in
turn implies that ~aV is a relative minimizer for problem (4.5). That α > 0 and α − 2β > 0
are equivalent to (4.9) follows from the deﬁnitions of α and β.

Example 4.3. For the Lennard–Jones potential (3.13) we have that:

φ′′(r) +

For simplicity, we assume δ1 > 6. We now have two cases:

i) Assume that δ2 ∈ (2, 6]. Then the second condition in (4.9) is automatically satisﬁed
and the ﬁrst condition holds if and only if V < V0, where V0 is determined from the
condition (cf. (4.7)):

c1δ1(δ1 − 2)

rδ1+2

c2δ2(δ2 − 2)(cid:21)

3

δ1−δ2

.

Thus in this case the regular tetrahedron ~aV is a (local) solution of (4.5) if and only if
V < V0.

ii) If δ2 > 6, then the second condition in (4.9) holds if and only if V < V1, where V1 is

determined from the condition:

c1δ1(δ1 − 6)

rδ1+2

c2δ2(δ2 − 6)

V1 =

√2
12 (cid:20) c1δ1(δ1 − 6)
c2δ2(δ2 − 6)(cid:21)

3

δ1−δ2

.

Since δ1 > δ2 > 6, it follows that V1 < V0. Thus in this case the regular tetrahedron ~aV
is a (local) solution of (4.5) if and only if V < V1.

Note that the ﬁrst condition in (4.9) holds for an interval (V0, V1) of volume values under
the conditions (3.17) in Example 3.4. The analysis now becomes rather complicated and we
just describe it qualitatively. If η > 6, then the second condition in (4.9) would hold as well
for values of V in an interval of the form (V2, V3) provided some condition similar to (3.17)
holds. Depending as to whether or not the intersection (V0, V1) ∩ (V2, V3) is non–empty, we
might get stable regular tetrahedrons. On the other hand, if η ∈ (2, 6], then the second
condition in (4.9) would hold as well for values of V in an interval of the form (V4,∞) and
again the existence of trivial states will depend on whether the corresponding intersection is
non–empty.

Example 4.5. For the potential (3.19)

3
r

φ′(r) = 4k + 6βr2, φ′′(r) +

7
r

φ′(r) = 8k + 10βr2.

Note that the stability conditions (4.9) holds when β ≥ 0 independent of the value of V !
That is, the regular tetrahedron ~aV is a relative minimizer for the problem (4.5) for all values
of V . In the case β = 0, since the functional (4.4) is convex, this state is a global minimizer.
On the other hand, if β < 0, the ﬁrst condition in (4.9) holds if V < V1 and the second

condition if V < V2 where

V 2
1 = −

243 β 3 ,

V 2

1125 β 3 .

Since V1 < V2 we get that conditions (4.9) hold both for V < V1. For V > V1 either one or
both conditions fail.

4.2 Existence and stability of nontrivial states
Let ~G : R × S × (0,∞) → R7 be given by the left hand side of (4.6):

~G(~x, V ) =(cid:20)

g(~a) − 288V 2
~∇E(~a) + λ~∇g(~a) (cid:21) ,

where ~x = (λ, ~a). We have now that

~G(~x, V ) =(cid:20)

It follows from (4.3) that

(~∇g(~a))t

~∇g(P~a) = P ~∇g(~a),
∇2g(P~a) = P∇2g(~a)P t, P ∈ R,

with similar relations for the total energy E. It follows now from (4.11a) that

where

~G(Q~x, V ) = Q ~G(~x, V ), Q ∈ G,
G =(cid:26)Q =(cid:20) 1 ~0t
~0 P (cid:21) : P ∈ R(cid:27) .

(4.10)

(4.11a)
(4.11b)

(4.12)

Thus the system (4.6) remains the same, up to reordering of the equations, when ~x = (λ, ~a)
is replaced by Q~x.

We now begin the analysis of the existence of solutions of the system (4.6) bifurcating

from the trivial branch:

T = {(λV , ~aV , V ) : λV , ~aV given by (4.7), V > 0} .

If we evaluate (4.10) at the trivial state (λV , ~aV , V ), then this matrix reduces to:

(4.13)

where ~∇g(~aV ) = 4a5
V (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)t and HV is given by (4.8). The matrix (4.13) has two
eigenvalues which are nonzero for every value of V > 0, with the remaining eigenvalues given
by:

20

1. µ1(V ) = φ′′(aV ) + 3
aV

responding eigenvectors:

φ′(aV ) with algebraic and geometric multiplicity three, and cor-

(0,−1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)t,

(0, 0,−1, 0, 0, 1, 0)t,

2. µ2(V ) = φ′′(aV ) + 7

sponding eigenvectors:

φ′(aV ) with algebraic and geometric multiplicity two, and corre-

(0,−1, 1, 0,−1, 1, 0)t,

(0,−1, 0, 1,−1, 0, 1)t.

(4.15)

Remark 4.6. Note that the expressions for these eigenvalues are the ones that appear in
Theorem 4.2 characterizing the stability of the trivial state (λV , ~aV , V ). Thus the trivial
state can change stability exactly when one of these two eigenvalues becomes zero.

To deal with these kernels with dimension greater than one, we proceed as in the pre-
vious section by considering a suitable reduced problem in each case. These reductions are
determined by the symmetries present in this problem which are embodied in (4.12).

4.2.1 The eigenvalue µ1(V )
Let us take the eigenvector ~g = (0, 0, 0,−1, 0, 0, 1)t of the eigenvalue µ1(V ) above. (The
analysis for the other two eigenvectors is similar.) By inspection is easy to get that the
isotropy subgroup H of G at ~g is given by:
H = (cid:26)(cid:18) λ a b c A B C

λ a b c A B C (cid:19) ,(cid:18) λ a b

Since T ⊂ R7
Also, since

H is given by:

It easy to check now that µ1(V ) is a simple eigenvalue of LH(V ) restricted to R7
corresponding eigenvector ~g, that is

H with

LH(V )~g = µ1(V )~g,

∀ V > 0.

We now have the result for the existence of bifurcating branches for the reduced problem.
We omit the proof as it is similar to that of Theorem 3.6.
Theorem 4.7. Let µ1(V1) = 0 and assume that dµ1
a branch of nontrivial solutions in R7
point where V = V1, where R7

dV (V1) 6= 0. Then the system (4.6) has
H × (0,∞) bifurcating from the trivial branch T at the

H is given by (4.16).

Remark 4.8. It follows from (4.12) that there are two additional branches of nontrivial
solutions of the system (4.6) of the forms:

{(λ, a, c, a, a, C, a) : λ ∈ R, a, c, C > 0} ,
{(λ, c, a, a, C, a, a) : λ ∈ R, a, c, C > 0} .

We now consider the case of the eigenvector ~g = (0,−1,−1,−1, 1, 1, 1)T of µ1(V ). This
eigenvector is obtained by adding the three eigenvector in (4.14). By inspection, the isotropy
subgroup H of G at ~g is given by those permutations in G that permute the symbols (a, b, c)
and (A, B, C) in (λ, a, b, c, A, B, C) with the same permutation. (Thus H has six elements.)
The H–ﬁxed point set is now given by:

It follows now that for the H reduced problem, µ1(V ) is a simple eigenvalue with correspond-
ing eigenvector ~g. The proof of the following result is as that of Theorem 3.6.

Theorem 4.9. Let µ1(V1) = 0 and assume that dµ1
a branch of nontrivial solutions in R7
point where V = V1, where R7

dV (V1) 6= 0. Then the system (4.6) has
H × (0,∞) bifurcating from the trivial branch T at the

H is given by (4.17).

Remark 4.10. By applying all the transformations in G, it follows from (4.12) that there
are three additional branches of solutions of the system (4.6) of the forms:

{(λ, A, A, a, a, a, A) : λ ∈ R, a, A > 0} ,
{(λ, a, A, A, A, a, a) : λ ∈ R, a, A > 0} ,
{(λ, A, a, A, a, A, a) : λ ∈ R, a, A > 0} .

Thus combining both theorems, we get that there are seven branches of nontrivial solutions
bifurcating from the trivial branch {(λV , ~aV , V ) : V > 0} at the value of V = V1 where
µ1(V1) = 0 and µ′

4.2.2 The eigenvalue µ2(V )
We now consider the case of the eigenvector ~g = (0,−2, 1, 1,−2, 1, 1)T of µ2(V ). This
eigenvector is obtained by adding the eigenvectors in (4.15). By inspection, the isotropy
subgroup H of G at ~g is given by

H = (cid:26)(cid:18) λ a b c A B C

It follows now that for the H reduced problem, µ2(V ) is a simple eigenvalue with correspond-
ing eigenvector ~g. The proof of the following result is as that of Theorem 3.6.

Theorem 4.11. Let µ2(V2) = 0 and assume that dµ2
a branch of nontrivial solutions in R7
point where V = V2, where R7

dV (V2) 6= 0. Then the system (4.6) has
H × (0,∞) bifurcating from the trivial branch T at the

H is given by (4.18).

Remark 4.12. By applying all the transformations in G, it follows from (4.12) that there
are two additional branches of solutions of the system (4.6) of the forms:

{(λ, b, a, b, b, a, b) : λ ∈ R, a, b > 0} ,
{(λ, b, b, a, b, b, a) : λ ∈ R, a, b > 0} .

5 Numerical examples

In this section we present some numerical examples illustrating the results of the previous
sections. For simplicity we limit ourselves to the three particle problem. The examples show
that the structure of the bifurcation diagrams is quite rich and complex. To construct the
pictures in this section, we use the results of Theorem 3.6, in particular the symmetries given
by (3.22), together with various numerical techniques to get full or detailed descriptions of
the corresponding bifurcation diagram.

To compute approximations of the bifurcating solutions predicted by Theorem 3.6, one
employs a predictor–corrector continuation method (cf. [1], [12]). The bifurcation points oﬀ
the trivial branch can be determined, by Theorem 3.6, from the solutions of the equation
µ(A) = 0 (cf.
(3.7)1, (3.23)). Secondary bifurcation points oﬀ nontrivial branches can
be detected by monitoring the sign of a certain determinant. Once a sign change in this
determinant is detected, the bifurcation point can be computed by a bisection or secant type
iteration. After detection and computation of a bifurcation point, then one can use formulas

24

(2.7)–(2.9) to get an approximate point on the solution curve from which the continuation
of the bifurcating branch can proceed.

Any trivial or nontrivial computed solution (~x∗, A∗) will be called stable, if the matrix
(∇2E + λ∇2g)(~x∗, A∗) (cf. (3.21)) is positive deﬁnite when restricted to the tangent space
at ~x∗ of the constraint of ﬁxed area. Otherwise the point (~x∗, A∗) will be called unstable.
We recall that the tangent space at ~x∗ of the constraint of ﬁxed area is given by

M =n(x, y, z) : ~∇g(~x∗) · (x, y, z) = 0o .

Note that since this space depends on the point ~x∗, then except for the trivial branch where
the solution is known explicitly, the stability of a solution can only be determined numerically.
In our ﬁrst example we consider the Lennard-Jones potential (3.13) with c1 = 1, c2 = 2,
δ1 = 12, and δ2 = 6. (We obtained similar results for other values of c1, c2 like those for argon
in which c1/c2 = 3.46 ˚A6.) From equation (3.14) we get that the bifurcation point oﬀ the
trivial branch is given approximately by A0 = 0.5877. For the case of Theorem 3.6 in which
a = b, we show in Figure 2 a close up of the bifurcating branch near this bifurcation point,
for the projection onto the A–a plane. In this ﬁgure and the others, the color red indicates
unstable solutions while the stable ones are marked in green. Note that the bifurcation is of
the trans–critical type. It is interesting to note that for an interval of values of the parameter
A to the left of A0 in the ﬁgure (approximately (0.5855, 0.5877)), there are multiple states
(trivial and nontrivial) which are stable, the trivial one having an energy less than the
nontrivial state in this case. In Figure 3 we look at the same branches of solutions, again the
projection onto the A–a plane, but for a larger interval of values of A. We now discover that
there are two secondary bifurcation points2 at approximately A1 = 0.6251 and A2 = 0.6670,
and once again we have multiple stable states (with diﬀerent symmetries) existing for an
interval of values of the parameter A. The branches of solutions bifurcating at these values
of A correspond to stable scalene triangles. Once a branch of solutions is computed, we can
use the symmetries (3.22) to generate other branches of solutions. In Figure 4 we show all
the solutions obtained via this process, projected to the abc space (no A dependence). Figure
5 show the same set of solution but with the branch or axis of trivial solutions coming out
of the page. The ﬁgures clearly show the variety of solutions (stable an unstable) for the
problem (3.2) as well as the rather complexity of the corresponding solution set.

For our next numerical example we consider the Buckingham potential (3.15) with pa-
rameter values α = β = γ = 1 and η = 4, which satisfy (3.17). In this case we have two

2In Figure 3 there are bifurcations only corresponding to the values of A0 = 0.5877, A1 = 0.6251 and
A2 = 0.6670. The apparent crossing of a branch of scalene triangles and the trivial branch is just an artifact
of the projection onto the A–a plane.

25

bifurcation points oﬀ the trivial branch (which correspond to solutions of µ(A) = 0) at ap-
proximately A0 = 5.3154 and A1 = 74.2253. The trivial branch is stable for A ∈ (A0, A1)
and unstable otherwise. Both bifurcations are into isosceles triangles, and both are of trans–
critical type but with diﬀerent stability patterns. In Figure 6 we show the solution set for
the case a = b. The plot shows the dependence of the a and c components on the area
parameter A. In Figure 7 we show the projection of this set onto the c vs A plane where
one can appreciate somewhat better the stability patterns at each bifurcation point, and
that there is a turning point for A ≈ 46 on the branch bifurcating from A0. Note that once
again we have multiple stable states existing for an interval of values of the parameter A.
No secondary bifurcations were detected in this case.

6 Final comments

The variety or type of solutions obtained from Theorems 3.6, 4.7, 4.9, and 4.11, could be
predicted generically from an analysis of the symmetries present in our problem as given by
(3.22) and (4.12). However such an analysis does not guaranties the existence of solutions
with the predicted symmetries. It is the application of the Equivariant Bifurcation Theorem
2.1 that actually yields the result that such solutions exist. The generic analysis however is
a preliminary step in identifying the spaces in which Theorem 2.1 can be applied. We should
also point out that the results on the bifurcating branches in Theorems 3.6, 4.7, 4.9, and 4.11
are global in the sense that the so called Crandall and Rabinowitz alternatives in Theorem
2.1 hold. That is, any bifurcating branch is either unbounded, or it intersects the boundary
of the domain of deﬁnition of the operator in the equilibrium conditions, or it intersects the
trivial branch at another eigenvalue.

The results of this paper might be useful in the analysis of the more general and com-
plex problem of arrays with many particles. As the total area or volume of such an array
is increased, thus reducing its density, one might expect that locally situations similar to
the ones discussed in this paper might be taking place in diﬀerent parts of the array.
It
is interesting to note here that the existence of multiple stable conﬁgurations detected in
the numerical examples of Section 5, opens up the possibility for the existence of multiple
equilibrium (local) states in a large molecular array, reminiscent of the bubble formation
phenomena mentioned in the introduction.
