We present a platform for the simulation of quantum magnetism with full control of interactions between
pairs of spins at arbitrary distances in one- and two-dimensional lattices. In our scheme, two internal atomic
states represent a pseudo-spin for atoms trapped within a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW). With the atomic
transition frequency aligned inside a band gap of the PCW, virtual photons mediate coherent spin-spin interac-
tions between lattice sites. To obtain full control of interaction coefﬁcients at arbitrary atom-atom separations,
ground-state energy shifts are introduced as a function of distance across the PCW. In conjunction with auxiliary
pump ﬁelds, spin-exchange versus atom-atom separation can be engineered with arbitrary magnitude and phase,
and arranged to introduce non-trivial Berry phases in the spin lattice, thus opening new avenues for realizing
novel topological spin models. We illustrate the broad applicability of our scheme by explicit construction for
several well known spin models.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum simulation has become an important theme for
research in contemporary physics [1]. A quantum simulator
consists of quantum particles (e.g., neutral atoms) that inter-
act by way of a variety of processes, such as atomic collisions.
Such processes typically lead to short-range, nearest-neighbor
interactions [2–6]. Alternative approaches for quantum sim-
ulation employ dipolar quantum gases, polar molecules, and
Rydberg atoms [7–12], leading to interactions that typically
scale as 1/r3, where r is the inter-particle separation. For
trapped ion quantum simulators [13–15], tunability in a power
law scaling of r−η with 0 < η < 3 can in principle be
achieved. Beyond simple power law scaling, it is also pos-
sible to engineer arbitrary long-range interactions mediated
by the collective phonon modes, which can be achieved by
independent Raman-addressing on individual ions [16].

Using photons to mediate controllable long-range inter-
actions between isolated quantum systems presents yet an-
other novel approach for assembling quantum simulators
[17]. Recent successful approaches include coupling ultra-
cold atoms to a driven photonic mode in a conventional mir-
ror cavity, thereby creating quantum many-body models (us-
ing atomic external degrees of freedom) with cavity-ﬁeld me-
diated inﬁnite-ragne interactions [18]. Finite-range and spa-
tially disordered interactions can be realized by employing
multi-mode cavities [19]. Recent demonstrations on coupling
cold atoms to guided mode photons in photonic crystal waveg-
uides [20, 21] and cavities [22, 23] present promising new
avenues (using atomic internal degrees of freedom) due to
unprecedented strong single atom-photon coupling rate and
scalability. Related efforts also exists for coupling solid-state
quantum emitters, such as quantum dots [24, 25] and diamond
nitrogen-vacancy centers [26, 27], to photonic crystals. Scal-
ing to a many-body quantum simulator based on solid-state

systems, however, still remains elusive. Successful implemen-
tations can be found in the microwave domain, where super-
conducting qubits behave as artiﬁcial atoms strongly coupled
to microwave photons propagating in a network formed by su-
perconducting resonators and transmission lines [28–30].

Here we propose and analyze a physical platform for sim-
ulating long-range quantum magnetism in which full con-
trol is achieved for the spin-exchange coefﬁcient between a
pair of spins at arbitrary distances in one- (1D) and two-
dimensional (2D) lattices. The enabling platform, as de-
scribed in Refs. [31, 32], is trapped atoms within photonic
crystal waveguides (PCWs), with atom-atom interactions me-
diated by photons of the guided modes (GMs) in the PCWs.
As illustrated in Fig. 1(a-b), single atoms are localized within
unit cells of the PCWs in 1D and 2D periodic dielectric struc-
tures. At each site, two internal atomic states are treated as
pseudo-spin states, with spin-1/2 considered here for deﬁnite-
ness [e.g., states |g(cid:105) and |s(cid:105) in Fig. 1(c)].

Our scheme utilizes strong, and coherent atom-photon in-
teractions inside a photonic band gap [31–35], and long-range
transport property of GM photons for the exploration of a
large class of quantum magnetism. This is contrary to con-
ventional hybrid schemes based on, e.g., arrays of high ﬁnesse
cavities [36–39] in which the pseudo-spin acquires only the
nearest (or at most the next-nearest) neighbor interactions due
to strong exponential suppression of photonic wave packet be-
yond single cavities.

In its original form [31–35], the localization of pseudo-
spin is effectively controlled by single-atom defect cavities
[31]. The cavity mode function can be adjusted to extend
over long distances within the PCWs, thereby permitting long-
range spin exchange interactions. The interaction can also be
tuned dynamically, via external addressing beams, to induce
complex long-range spin transport, which we describe in the
following [31, 32].

To engineer tunable,

long-range spin Hamiltonians, we
use an atomic Λ scheme and two-photon Raman transitions,
where an atom ﬂips its spin state by scattering one photon
from an external pump ﬁeld into the GMs of a PCW. The

guided-mode photon then propagates within the waveguide,
inducing spin ﬂip in an atom located at a distant site via the re-
verse two-photon Raman process. When we align the atomic
resonant frequency inside the photonic band gap, as depicted
in Fig. 1(d), only virtual photons can mediate this remote spin
exchange and the GM dynamics are fully coherent, effectively
creating a spin Hamiltonian with long-range interactions. As
discussed in Refs. [31, 32], the overall strength and length
scale of the spin-exchange coefﬁcients can be tuned by an ex-
ternal pump ﬁeld, albeit within the constraints set by a func-
tional form that depends on the dimensionality and the pho-
tonic band structure.

To fully control spin-exchange coefﬁcients at arbitrary sep-
arations, here we adopt a Raman-addressing scheme similarly
discussed for cold atoms in optical lattices [40–42]. We in-
troduce atomic ground-state energy shifts as a function of dis-
tance across the PCW. Due to conservation of energy, these
shifts suppress reverse two-photon Raman processes in the
original scheme [31, 32], forbidding spin exchange within the
entire PCW. However, we can selectively activate certain spin-
exchange interactions J(rm,n) between atom pairs (m,n) sep-
arated by rm,n, by applying an auxiliary sideband whose fre-
quency matches that of the original pump plus the ground state
energy shift between the atom pairs. This allows us to build
a prescribed spin Hamiltonian with interaction terms “one by
one”. Note that each sideband in a Raman-addressing beam
can be easily introduced, e.g., by an electro-optical modulator.
By introducing multiple sidebands and by controlling their
frequencies, amplitudes and relative phases, we can engineer
spin Hamiltonians with arbitrary, complex interaction coefﬁ-
cients J(rm,n). Depending on the dimensionality and the type
of spin Hamiltonians, our scheme requires only one or a few
Raman beams to generate the desired interactions. Further-
more, by properly choosing the propagation phases of the Ra-
man beams, we can imprint geometric phases in the spin sys-
tem, thus opening new possibilities for realizing novel topo-
logical spin models.

We substantiate the broad applicability of our methods by
explicit elaboration of the set of pump ﬁelds required to re-
alize well-known spin Hamiltonians. For one-dimensional
spin chains, we consider the implementation of the Haldane-
Shastry model [43, 44]. For two-dimensional spin lattices,
we elaborate the conﬁgurations for realizing topological ﬂat-
bands [45, 46] in Haldane’s spin model [43], as well as a
“checkerboard” chiral-ﬂux lattice [45, 46]. We also con-
sider a 2D XXZ spin Hamiltonian with J(rm,n) ∝ 1/rη
m,n and
η = 1,2,3 [47]. In addition, we report numerical results on
the η-dependence of its phase diagram.

CONTROLLING SPIN-SPIN INTERACTION THROUGH

MULTI-FREQUENCY DRIVING

In the following, we discuss how to achieve full control of
interactions by multi-frequency pump ﬁelds. We assume (i)
N atoms trapped in either a 1D or 2D PCW as depicted in
Fig.1(a-b). For simplicity, we assume one atom per unit cell
of the PCW, although this assumption can be relaxed after-

described by the following Hamiltonian (using ¯h = 1)

where ˜ωα are the detunings of the sidebands from the main

photonic GMs under the condition that (iv) max{|Ω|,| ˜ωα −

ﬁrstly, the excited state is only virtually populated, and that,
secondly, the time-dependence induced by the sideband driv-
ing is approximately constant over the timescale ∆−1. As dis-
cussed in Refs. [31, 32], if ωL − ωg lies in the photonic band
gap, photon-mediated interactions by GMs are purely coher-
ent. [48] Under the Born-Markov approximation, we then ar-

It is important to highlight that multi-frequency driving also
enables the possibility to engineer geometrical phases and,
therefore, topological spin models. If the pump ﬁeld propaga-
tion is not perfectly transverse, that is kL · rm(n) (cid:54)= 0 (kL being
the wave vector of the Raman ﬁeld), the effective Hamiltonian
Eq. (7) acquires spatial-dependent, complex spin-exchange
coefﬁcients via the phase of XαX∗
β in Eq. (8); see later dis-
cussions.

Beyond an ideal setting, we now stress a few potential er-
ror sources. Firstly, for practical situations, the gradient per
site δ will be a limited resource, making Eq. (7) not an ideal
approximation. Careful Floquet analysis on time-dependent
Hamiltonian in Eqs. (5-6) is required, to be discussed later.
Secondly, there is an additional Stark shift on state |s(cid:105) due to
the Raman ﬁelds

present strategies for optimizing the choice of δ , and mini-
mizing detrimental effects due to undesired time-dependent
terms in Eqs. (5) and (9) in later discussions.

ically, we require |rm,n| (cid:28) ξ =(cid:112)|A/∆c|, where A is the band

where we have deﬁned Xα = Ωα /(2∆); ωg,n = ωg(rn) is the
site dependent ground state energy shift, and ˜J(rm,n) is the
atom-GM photon coupling strength [31, 32] that typically de-
pends on atomic separation rm,n = rm − rn.
We focus on “sideband engineering”, and treat | ˜J(rm,n)|
as approximately constant over atomic separations considered
[49]. This is valid as long as |rm,n| is much smaller than the
decay length scale ξ of the coupling strength ˜J(rm,n). Specif-
curvature, ∆c = max{ωc − (ωL − ωg,n)} is the maximal de-
tuning of the band edge to the frequency of coupled virtual
photons that mediate interactions [see Fig. 1(c)], and we have
assumed that the variation of ground state energies ωg,n are
small compared to ∆c. Exact functional form of ˜J(rm,n) can
be found in Refs. [31, 32] and in SI Appendix A.

The time dependence in Eq. (4) can be further engineered
and simpliﬁed. We note that the interaction between two
atoms n and m will be highly dependent on the resonant condi-
tion ωg,m −ωg,n = ˜ωβ − ˜ωα, provided the ground state energy
difference |ωg,n − ωg,m| is much larger than the characteris-
˜J|. The intuitive picture
tic time scale of interactions |XαX∗
β
is depicted in Fig. 2(a): the atom n scatters from sideband α
a photon with energy ωL + ˜ωα − ωg,n into the GMs. When
this GM photon propagates to the atom m, it will only be re-
scattered into a sideband β that satisﬁes ωL + ˜ωα − ωg,n =
ωL + ˜ωβ − ωg,m, while the rest of the sidebands remain off-
resonant. Figure 2 (b) depicts a reversed process.
For concreteness, we discuss a 1D case where we assume
(v) a linear gradient in the ground state energy ωg,n ≡ nδ , with
δ being the energy difference between adjacent sites. The
sidebands will be chosen accordingly such that ˜ωα = αδ , with
α ∈ Z.

Summing up, with all these assumptions (i-v), the result-
ing effective Hamiltonian Eq. (4) can ﬁnally be rewritten as

In Refs. [31, 32], it was shown that ZZ interaction can be
created by adding an extra pump ﬁeld to the |g(cid:105) ↔ |e(cid:105) transi-
tion in Fig. 1(c). However, as ZZ terms in this scheme [31, 32]
do not involve ﬂipping atomic states, it is not directly ap-
plicable to our multi-frequency pump method. Nonetheless,
since we can generate XX and YY interactions independently,
a straightforward scheme to engineer HZZ is to use single qubit
rotations to rotate the spin coordinates X ↔ Z or Y ↔ Z, fol-
lowed by stroboscopic evolutions [50] to engineer the full spin
Hamiltonian.

where we have used the following notation to characterize ro-
tations along the n axis, i.e., Rn(θ ) = eiσ·nθ /2. This is particu-
larly useful when both XY and ZZ interactions have the same
coupling strengths (e.g., the Haldane-Shastry model). For en-
gineering ZZ terms in a generic spin Hamiltonian, one can
apply spin-rotations Ry(π/2), such that Ry(π/2)σxR†
y(π/2) =
σz, to transform arbitrary XX terms into desired ZZ interac-
tions. Spin-rotation can be realized, e.g., with a collective
microwave driving Hmw = ∑n
, in which a
π/2-microwave pulse rotates the basis {|g(cid:105)n,|s(cid:105)n} → {(|g(cid:105)n +

lowing stroboscopic evolution: {HXY ,HZZ,HXY ,HZZ, . . .} in

lution in each step δt = t/Nt is given by

Figure 3. Atomic “butterﬂy” level structure. Two pump ﬁelds Ωs
and Ωg, tuned to couple to the same GM photon, are introduced to
control XX and YY interactions independently.

Independent control of XX and YY interactions

So far, we can fully engineer a XY Hamiltonian with equal
weight between XX and YY terms. We now show ﬂexible
control of XX and YY interactions with slight modiﬁcations in
the atomic level structure and the Raman-addressing scheme.
In particular, we employ a butterﬂy-like level structure where
there are two transitions, |g(cid:105) ↔ |e(cid:105) and |s(cid:105) ↔ | ˜e(cid:105), coupled to
the same GM, as depicted in Fig. 3. We will use two multi-
frequency Raman pump ﬁelds, Ωg(t) and Ωs(t), to induce
|g(cid:105) ↔ | ˜e(cid:105) ↔ |s(cid:105) and |s(cid:105) ↔ |e(cid:105) ↔ |g(cid:105) two-photon Raman tran-
sitions, respectively.

For example, to control XX or YY interactions, we require
that the two pump ﬁelds induce spin ﬂips with equal ampli-
tude, i.e., σgs ± σsg. This is possible if we choose the main
frequencies of the pumps (ωL,g and ωL,s) such that ωL,s =
ωL,g +2ωg, and match their amplitudes such that |Ωg,α|/∆g =
|Ωs,α|/∆s, where ∆s = ωe − ωL,s, ∆g = ω ˜e − (ωL,g + ωg), and
|∆s,g| (cid:29) |Ωs,g|.

Following the procedure to adiabatically eliminate the ex-
cited states as well as the GMs, we arrive at the following
Hamiltonian (SI Appendix A),

Assuming the laser beams that generate the Raman ﬁelds

versely, i.e., kL ·rm,n = 0, we can generate either X or Y com-
ponents, (σ m

exotic combinations are available with generic choice of φgs.
Moreover, if the laser beams are not co-propagating, they cre-
ate spatially dependent phases φgs,m. This can create site de-
pendent XX, YY or XY terms.

Independent control of ZZ interactions

An independently controlled ZZ Hamiltonian, in combina-
tion with arbitrary XY terms, would allow us to engineer a

where we see that the leading error is O(δt2). When repeating
this step Nt times, the leading error in the evolution can be

(13)

for Nt (cid:29) 1. It can be shown [51] that higher order error terms
give smaller error bounds. Because of long-range interactions,
the commutator [HXY ,HZZ] contains up to N(N − 1)(N − 2)
terms that are different from 0 [52]. Thus the scaling of the
error in the limit of N (cid:29) 1 is approximately given by

E2 ≤ N(RJt)2

Nt

,

(14)

where J = max[Jm,n] is the largest energy scale of the Hamilto-
nian we want to simulate, and R is the approximate number of
atoms coupled through the interaction. For example, if Jm,n is
a nearest neighbor interaction, R = 1. If Jm,n ∝ 1/|m − n|η,
n=1 1/|n|η, which typically grows much slower
then R ∝ ∑N
than N. Since E2 ∝ 1/Nt, the Trotter error in Nt steps can in
principle be decreased to a given accuracy ε by using enough
steps, i.e., Nt ≥ N(RJt)2

More complicated stroboscopic evolutions may lead to a
more favorable error scaling [53–55], though in real experi-
ments there will be a trade-off between minimizing the Trotter
error and the ﬁdelity of the individual operations to achieve
HXY and HZZ. As this will depend on the particular experi-
mental set-up, we will leave such analysis out of current dis-
cussions. For the sake of discussion, we will only consider
the simplest kind of stroboscopic evolution that we depicted
in Fig. 4.

where ˜J is the GM photon coupling rate [see Eq. (8)] that we

This requires that the physical size of the spin chain be small
compared to the decay length of ˜J (SI Appendix A). That is,
Nd (cid:28) ξ , where d is the atomic separation. It is then straight-
forward to ﬁnd the required pump amplitudes Ωα (or equiva-
lently Xα) by solving Eq. (16) for all n. Notice that the system
of equations Eq. (16) is overdetermined, and therefore one can
ﬁnd several solutions of it. However, we choose the solution
that minimizes the total intensity ∑α |Ωα|2. Figure 5 shows
that the total intensity converges to a constant value for large
N, as a result of decreasing sideband amplitudes for decreas-
ing 1/r2 interaction strengths. This is conﬁrmed in Fig. 5 as
we see the growth of the ratio between maximum and mini-
mum sideband amplitudes when N increases. The same ex-
ternal pump conﬁguration can also be used to induce the ZZ

previous section.

where Jn = J0/sin2(nπ/N), J0 = Jπ2/N2 and N is the number
of spins. The interaction strength decays slowly with approx-
imately a 1/r2-dependence while satisfying a periodic bound-
ary condition. Such spin Hamiltonian is difﬁcult to realize
in most physical setups that interact, e.g., via dipolar interac-
tions.

We can engineer the periodic boundary condition and the
long-range interaction Jn directly using a linear array of
trapped atoms coupled to a PCW. To achieve this, we in-
duce atomic ground state energy shift mδ according to the
spin index m, and then uniformly illuminate the trapped atoms
with an external pump consisting of N frequency compo-
nents ˜ωα = αδ , each with an amplitude denoted by Ωα and
α = 0,1, ...,N − 1. Regardless of the position of atoms, all
pump pairs with frequency difference nδ contribute to the spin
interaction Jn. Considering ﬁrst the XY terms, and according

ENGINEERING SPIN HAMILTONIANS FOR 2D SYSTEMS:

TOPOLOGICAL AND FRUSTATED HAMILTONIANS

In the following, we discuss speciﬁc examples for engi-
neering 2D spin Hamiltonians that are topologically nontriv-
ial.
In particular, we discuss two chiral-ﬂux lattice mod-
els that require long-range hopping terms to engineer single
particle ﬂat-bands with nonzero Chern numbers, which are
key ingredients to realizing fractional quantum hall effects
(FQHE) without Landau levels [45, 46]. Furthermore, our
spin-1/2 system interacts like hard core bosons since individ-
ual atoms that participate in the spin-exchange process cannot
be doubly-excited. With the addition of tunable long-range ZZ
interactions, we can readily build a novel many-body system
that shall exhibit strongly correlated phases including FQH
and supersolid states [56].

plying a strong pump ﬁeld of amplitude Ω0 (frequency ωL)
to pair with sidebands |Ωα| (cid:28) |Ω0| of detunings ˜ωα = δα
to satisfy the resonant conditions. To generate the desired
chiral-ﬂux lattice, we need to carefully consider the propaga-
tion phases k0 · rn (kα · rn) of the pump ﬁeld (and sidebands),
where rn = d(nx ˆx +ny ˆy) is the site coordinate and nx,y ∈ Z. In
the following we pick k = kα = π/d.

We can generate the required couplings in Hﬂat, term-by-

term, as follows:

ing along ˆy, that is, X0(rn) =

band of detuning ˜ωx = δx = |µB∇B·∆rx| with Xx(rm) =
|Ω1|
2∆ [e−inyπ − iζ e−i(nx+1)π ]. The sideband is formed by
two ﬁeld components in εy(t) and εx(t), propagating
along ˆy and ˆx respectively [see Fig. 6 and Eqs. (19-
20)], with an amplitude ratio of ζ and with an initial
π/2 phase difference. These two ﬁelds are used to inde-
pendently control real and imaginary parts of the spin-
exchange coefﬁcients. Using Eq. (??) under the condi-
tion that |Ω0| (cid:29) |Ωα|, we see that the NN coupling rate
along ˆx is

where t1 = ˜J|X0||Xx|(cid:112)1 + ζ 2. This results in the stag-

gered phase pattern with φ = tan−1 ζ that can be tuned
arbitrarily. Extension to the staggered NN coupling
along ∆ry can be realized by introducing another side-
band with detuning ˜ωy = δy = |µB∇B·∆ry| and Xy(rn +

Eqs. (19) and (20).
• NNN coupling along ∆rα=xy,xy∗: The coupling coefﬁ-
cient ±t2 is real and the sign depends on the sub-lattices.
To pair with the pump ﬁeld X0 at site rn, we use two
sidebands formed by ﬁeld components in εx(t), prop-
agating along ˆx with detunings δα=xy,xy∗ and Xα (rn +

2∆ e−iπ(nx+1) at NNN sites. The result-

Summing up, all the components in the Raman ﬁeld can
be introduced by merely two pump beams propagating along
ˆx and ˆy directions, respectively. Explicitly writing down the
time-dependent electric ﬁeld E(rn,t) that generates the de-
sired Raman ﬁeld Ω(t) ≡ (cid:104)s|d · E∗|e(cid:105), we have E(rn,t) =

We can use an array of atoms trapped within a 2D PCW,
as in Fig. 1(b), to engineer the Hamiltonian Hﬂat of Eq. (17).
For simplicity, we assume that there is one atom per site al-
though this is not a fundamental assumption [57]. As shown
in Fig. 6(a), we need to engineer spin exchange in four dif-
ferent directions, namely, ˆx, ˆy, ˆx± ˆy. We ﬁrst introduce linear
Zeeman shifts by properly choosing a magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ent ∇B (see SI Appendix B) such that δα = |µB∇B · ∆rα|,
where µB is the magnetic moment, ∆rα are vectors associ-
ated with the directions of spin exchange: {∆rα}α=x,y,xy,xy∗ =
{d ˆx,d ˆy,d( ˆx + ˆy),d( ˆx− ˆy)}, and d is the lattice constant. To
activate spin exchange along these directions while suppress-
ing all other processes, we consider a simplest case by ap-

tion dipole moment. For the ﬁeld propagating along ˆy, the
amplitude reads

εy(t) = ε0 + ε1(e−iδxt − e−iδyt ) + ε3(e−2iδxt + e−2iδyt ).(19)

For the ﬁeld propagating along ˆx, we similarly require

εx(t) = iζε1(e−iδxt + e−iδyt ) + ε2(e−iδxyt − e−iδxy∗t ). (20)
Each term in Eqs. (19-20) contributes to speciﬁc sideband in
the Raman ﬁeld and |Ωα| = (cid:104)s|d· ˆz|e(cid:105)εα. Pairing individual
sidebands to the main Raman ﬁeld introduced by the leading
term ε0 (cid:29) ε1,2,3 leads to the desired spin exchange interactions
as discussed above.

We note that there are more ways other than Eqs. (19-20)
It is also possible to in-

troduce both blue-detuned (δα > 0) and red-detuned (δ−α =

(21)

which has contributions from Xα and X−α of blue- and red-
sidebands, respectively. Arranging both sidebands with equal
amplitudes can lead to equal contributions in the engineered
coupling coefﬁcient. This corresponds to replacing frequency

A “honeycomb”-equivalent topological lattice model

To further demonstrate the ﬂexibility of the proposed plat-
form, we create Haldane’s honeycomb model [58] via a topo-
logically equivalent brick-wall lattice [59, 60]. Here, we en-
gineer the brick-wall conﬁguration using the identical atom-
PCW platform discussed in the previous example. Mapping
between the two models is illustrated in Figs. 7(a-b), which
contains the following two non-trivial steps: i) generating a
checkerboard-like NN-exchange pattern in the ˆx direction; ii)
obtaining NNN (along ∆rxy,xy∗) and NNNN (along 2∆ry) cou-
plings with the same strength and with a coupling phase φmn =
±φ, which alternates sign across two sub-lattices. Thus, our
target Hamiltonian is given by

[see Fig. 7] and t1 is the coupling coefﬁcient. Note that, for

simplicity, we discuss a special case where all NN-coupling
coefﬁcients from a brick-wall vertex are identical. The second
summation in Eq. (24) runs over both NNN and NNNN pairs
with identical coupling coefﬁcient t2 and alternating phase
φmn = ±φ; see Fig. 7.

As in the previous case, we use a strong pump ﬁeld of am-
plitude Ω0, propagating along ˆy, as well as several other side-
bands |Ωα| (cid:28) |Ω0| of detunings ˜ωα = δα to generate all nec-
essary spin-exchange terms. Detailed descriptions on engi-
neering individual terms can be found in SI Appendix C.

x = t1

The most important ingredient, discussed here, is that we
can generate checkerboard-like NN coupling (along ˆx), with
2 [1− (−1)nx−ny ]. This is achieved by using
Jm,n = ˜JX0X∗
|Ω|
4∆ [e−inyπ +
a sideband of detuning δx and amplitude Xx =
ζ e−i(nx+1)π ] at position rm = rn + ∆rx, formed by two ﬁelds
propagating along ˆy and ˆx, respectively. If both ﬁelds have
the same amplitude (ζ = 1), they either add up or cancel
completely depending on whether nx − ny is odd or even. If
one applies the same trick toward NN coupling along ˆy, but
with ζ (cid:54)= 1, the coupling amplitude modulates spatially in a
checkerboard pattern. Essentially all three NN terms around
a brick-wall vertex can be independently controlled, opening
up further possibilities to engineer, for example, Kitaev’s hon-
eycomb lattice model [61, 62].

For physical implementations, again only two pump beams
can introduce all components required in the Raman ﬁeld,
which is very similar to the previous case in either Eqs (19-
20) or Eqs (22-23). Detailed conﬁgurations can be found in
SI Appendix C. We stress that by merely changing the way
the Raman ﬁeld is modulated, one can dynamically adjust the
engineered spin Hamiltonians and even the topology, as we

at each separations [71]. Moreover, the parameter θ that de-
termines the ratio between ZZ and XY interaction can be con-
trolled by using different pump intensities in the stroboscopic
steps (SI Appendix D).

2 ∑N

i (cid:104)σ z

To illustrate physics that can emerge in the ﬁrst experimen-
tal setups with only a few atoms, we study the total magnetiza-
tion of a small square lattice of ns × ns (= N) 16 atomic spins.
We apply exact diagonalization restricting to Nexc ≤ 8 exci-
tations for N = 16 spins and cover half of the phase diagram
with B > 0. In Fig. 8, we explore the mean polarization of
i (cid:105)/N as a function of B and θ for
the system M/N = 1
η = 1 (a), 2 (b), 3 (c) and NN couplings (d). At θ = 0, the sys-
tem behaves classically showing the so-called devil staircase
[72] of insulating states with different rational ﬁlling factors
and crystalline structures. With only NN couplings, as shown
in Fig. 8 (d), the phase diagram is symmetric with respect
to θ. However, long-range hoppings modify the crystal be-
havior for θ ≶ 0, making this phase diagram asymmetric; see
Figs. 8 (a-c). Longer-range coupling helps the crystal acquire
off-diagonal correlations, turning crystalline states into super-
solids. This was predicted using dipolar couplings [47, 68].
Nonetheless, experimental observations remain elusive [73].
The higher degree of asymmetry for η = 1-interactions is a
strong signature that frustration effects are much more rel-
evant than those with NN or dipolar couplings [74]. This
points at the possibility of observing more stable supersolid
phases as well as other frustration-related phenomena such
as long-lived metastable states which could serve as quan-
tum memories [67]. Another especially interesting arena is
the behavior of strongly long-range interacting systems under
non-equilibrium dynamics. It has recently been predicted to
yield “instantaneous” transmission of correlations after a lo-
cal quench [70, 75, 76], breaking the so-called Lieb-Robinson
bound.

LIMITATIONS AND ERROR ANALYSIS

Till now, we have mainly focused on how to engineer H0 in
an ideal situation. We neglected spontaneous emission or GM
photon losses and considered that the energy gradient (or δ ,
the ground state energy difference between nearest neighbor-
ing atoms) can be made very large compared to the interaction
energy scales that we want to simulate (|δ| (cid:29) |Jm,m+1|). Since
the effect of ﬁnite cooperativities was considered in detail in
Refs.
[31, 32], and their conclusions translate immediately
to our extension to multi-frequency pumps, in this work we
mainly focus on the effect of ﬁnite δ . In addition, we also dis-
cuss the effects of AC Stark shifts as in Eq. (9), and its error
contributions.

Corrections introduced from higher harmonics: a Floquet

analysis

We discuss errors and the associated error reduction scheme
following a Floquet analysis [77], applicable mainly to
1D models.
Including all the time-dependent terms in a

compare both cases. This is a unique feature enabled by our
capability to fully engineer long-range spin interactions.

Moreover, many of the tricks discussed above can also be
implemented in 1D PCWs.
It is even possible to engineer
a topological 1D spin chain, by exploiting long-range inter-
actions to map out non-trivial connection between spins. For
example, our method can readily serve as an realistic approach
to realize a topological 1D spin chain as recently proposed in
Ref. [63].

XXZ spin Hamiltonian with tunable interaction 1/rη

In the last example, we highlight the possibility of engi-
neering a large class of XXZ spin Hamiltonians, which were
studied extensively in the literature [47, 64–70] because of the
emergence of frustration related phenomena. A XXZ Hamil-
tonian is typically written as

where an effective magnetic ﬁeld B controls the number of
excitations, rm,m = |rn − rm| and the parameter θ determines
the relative strength between the ZZ and XY interactions. This
class of spin models has been previously studied, but mostly
restricted to nearest neighbours [64–67] or dipolar (η = 3)
interactions [47, 68, 69].

In our setup, one can simulate XXZ models with arbitrary η
by ﬁrst introducing unique ground state energy shifts at each
of the separation rn−rm (SI Appendix D), and then applying a
strong pump ﬁeld of amplitude Ω0 together with Nd auxiliary
ﬁelds Ωα of different detunings to introduce spin interactions

multi-frequency pumping scheme, we have [Eq. 5] H(t) =
∑p Hpeipδt, where Hp represents the part that oscillates at fre-
quency pδ . This Hamiltonian has a period T = 2π/δ . It can
be shown that at integer multiples of T , the observed system
should behave as if it is evolving under an effective Hamilto-
nian given by [77]

(26)

This means that the leading error in our simple scheme would
be on the order of J2/δ , where J is the simulated interaction
strength. However, we note that if Hp = ±H−p, the leading
error term ∑p[Hp,H−p]/(pδ ) should vanish. In other words,
ﬁrst order error vanishes if Hp is either symmetric or anti-
symmetric under a time-reversal operation T . While the orig-
inal Hamiltonian H(t) doesn’t necessarily possess such sym-
metry, it is possible to introduce a two-step periodic operation
H2step = {H, T H,H, T H, ...} to cancel the ﬁrst order error
while keeping the time-independent part H2step,0 = H0 iden-
tical. This results in an effective Hamiltonian in the Floquet
picture:

Heff,2 = H0 + Herr,2 ≈ H0 +

(27)

where ˜Hp is the (operator) Fourier coefﬁcient of the two-step
Hamiltonian at frequency pδ and the leading error reduces to
the order of J3/δ 2. To achieve the time-reversal operation,
we must reverse the phase of the driving lasers, as well as the
sign of the energy offsets between the atoms. Speciﬁcally, we

can engineer a periodic two-step Hamiltonian by ﬁrst mak-
ing the system evolve under presumed H0 (along with other
time-dependent terms) for a time interval T , and then, for
the next time interval T , we ﬂip the sign of the energy gra-
dient, followed by reversing the propagation direction of the
Raman ﬁelds such that Xα → X∗
α in Eq. (5). As a result, all
the time-dependent Hamiltonians Hp, ∀p (cid:54)= 0, become H−p
in the second step, resulting in ˜Hp = (−1)p ˜H−p required for
error reduction. Whereas, the time-independent Hamiltonian
H0 remains identical in the two-step Hamiltonian. See SI Ap-
pendix E for more discussions.

Numerical analysis on the Haldane-Shastry spin chain

We now analyze numerically and discuss error on one
particular example. For numerical simplicity, we choose
the Haldane-Shastry model as its one-dimensional character
makes it numerically more accessible. However, the conclu-
sions regarding the estimation of errors can be mostly ex-
tended to other models. As we have shown in Eq. (15), the
Haldane-Shastry Hamiltonian is composed by an XY term
plus a ZZ term that we can simulate stroboscopically. As
we already analyzed the Trotter error due to the stroboscopic
evolution, here we focus on the XY part of the Hamiltonian,
which reads

To illustrate the effect of error cancellations, we consider
ﬁrst a scenario where we directly apply Eqs. (29). To lead-
ing order, the effective Hamiltonian is Heff,1 as in Eq. (26).
We then analyze the two-step driving, using the effective
Hamiltonian Heff,2 in Eq. (27), with ˜Hp given by SI Appendix
Eqs. (E5)-(E6).
We calculate the ground state energies and eigenvectors of
H0, Heff,1 and Heff,2, that we denote as E0,1,2 and |Ψ0,1,2(cid:105) re-
spectively, for different number of atoms and different ratios
of δ /J0. The results are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. In panels (a)
we show the error in absolute value with respect to the ideal
Hamiltonian H0. Interestingly, due to particular structure of
|Ψ0(cid:105) and Hp, one can show that (cid:104)Ψ0|[Hp,H−p]|Ψ0(cid:105) ≈ 0 and
the ﬁrst order correction to the energy vanishes. This is con-
ﬁrmed in Fig. 10 (a), where we found that the error actually
scales with 1/δ 2.

Moreover, it is also enlightening to compare the overlap of
the ground states as shown in Figs. 9(b)-10(b). We only com-
pute the even atom number conﬁguration as the odd ones are
degenerate and therefore the ground state is not uniquely de-
ﬁned. We see that the ground state overlap of Heff,2 is several
orders of magnitude better than the one with Heff,1. Moreover,
its dependence on δ is better than the 1/δ 2 expectation.

[[ ˜Hac,p,H0], ˜Hac,p], [[ ˜Hac,p,H0], ˜Hp] and [[ ˜Hp,H0], ˜Hac,p] are re-
lated to the time-dependent Stark shifts, and should be evalu-

Generic Hamiltonians with translational invariance. By
translational
there are no site-
dependent spin interactions, and the spin-exchange coefﬁ-
cients remain identical as we offset the spin index by one
or more. This means that all components in the pump ﬁeld
should drive the system with uniform optical phases as in
the Haldane-Shastry model discussed above. The resulting
Fourier coefﬁcients ˜Hac,p = ˜Ap ∑n σ n
ss would have identical ef-
fect on all spins ( ˜Ap being a constant amplitude). As a result,
the above mentioned commutators vanish, suggesting that the
error by ˜Hac(t) averages out to zero in the Floquet picture.
In the butterﬂy scheme, however, both |g(cid:105) and |s(cid:105) states are
pumped and they may be shifted differently. This leads to
slight modiﬁcations in the engineered XX and YY terms; see
SI Appendix F.

Models containing sub-lattices. For topological models that
contain sub-lattices, as in our examples, the pump ﬁelds are
not perfectly transverse and Stark shifts are site-dependent,
resulting in non-vanishing error. However, we also note
that the coupling coefﬁcients appearing in the commuta-
tors [[ ˜Hac,p,H0], ˜Hac,p] and [[ ˜Hp,H0], ˜Hac,p]([[ ˜Hac,p,H0], ˜Hp])
are on the order of J|Ω|4/∆2 and J2|Ω|2/∆, respectively. For
realistic PCW realizations, we may set ˜J/∆ (cid:38) O(1). Since
p/Jm,n ∼ O(∆/ ˜J), the energy scales of the commutators are

sub-lattice models be purposely driven with large amplitude

become important in the resulting spin dynamics. However,
if we choose a large pump detuning ∆ > ˜J, the dominant

CONCLUSIONS & OUTLOOK

In this manuscript, we have shown that atom-nanophotonic
systems present appealing platforms to engineer many-body
quantum matter by using low-dimensional photons to mediate
interaction between distant atom pairs. We have shown that,
by introducing energy gradients in one and two-dimensions
and by applying multi-frequency Raman addressing beams, it
is possible to engineer a large class of many-body Hamilto-
nians.
In particular, by carefully arranging the propagation
phases of Raman beams, it is possible to introduce geometric
phases into the spin system, thereby realizing nontrivial topo-
logical models with long-range spin-spin interactions.

Another appealing feature of our platform is the possibil-
ity of engineering periodic boundary conditions, as explicitly
shown in the 1D Haldane-Shastry model, or other global lat-
tice topology by introducing long-range interactions between
spins located at the boundaries of a ﬁnite system. Using 2D
PCWs, for example, it is possible to create novel spin-lattice

11

geometries such as M¨obius strip, torus, or lattice models with
singular curvatures such as conic geometries [79] that may
lead to localized topological states with potential applications
in quantum computations.

We emphasize that all the pairwise-tunable interactions can
be dynamically tuned via, e.g., electro-optical modulators at
time scales much faster than that of characteristic spin inter-
actions. Therefore, the spin interactions can either be adiabat-
ically adjusted to transform between spin models or even be
suddenly quenched down to zero by removing all or part of
the Raman coupling beams. We may monitor spin dynamics
with great detail: after we initially prepare the atomic spins in
a known state by, say, individual or collective microwave ad-
dressing, we can set the system to evolve under a designated
spin Hamiltonian, followed by removing all the interactions to
“freeze” the dynamics for atomic state detection. Potentially,
this allows for detailed studies on quantum dynamics of long-
range, strongly interacting spin systems that are driven out-
of-equilibrium. The dynamics may be even richer since the
spins are weakly coupled to a structured environment via pho-
ton dissipations. We expect such a new platform may bring
novel opportunities to the study of quantum thermalization in
long-range many-body systems, or for further understanding
of information propagation in a long-range quantum network.

Supporting Information (SI)

In Appendix A, we give a detailed derivation of the time-
dependent effective Hamiltonian of Eq. (4) of the main text.
In Appendix B, we discuss how to properly introduce ground
state energy shifts to engineer generic spin models in two-
dimensions. In Appendix C and D, we describe in detail the
PCW and the pump ﬁeld conﬁgurations to engineer a topo-
logical brick-wall lattice model and a XXZ model with 1/rη-
dependence, respectively. In Appendix E, we discuss in detail
how to engineer a two-step Hamiltonian. Last, in Appendix F,
we additionally discuss the role of AC Stark shift in a butterﬂy
scheme.

Appendix A: Complete derivation of ﬁnal time-dependent

The PCWs support localized one or two-dimensional pho-
tonic Guided Modes (GMs), which can be described by a
Hamiltonian (using ¯h = 1):

HGM = ∑

(A1)

where ωk is the dispersion relation of the GMs. Neglecting
counter-rotating terms, the light-matter Hamiltonian can be
written as follows:

(A2)

where gk(rn) = gkeik·rn is the single-photon coupling con-
stant. The atomic Hamiltonian is given by

where it is important to highlight that we introduce a site-
dependent energy in the hyperﬁne level |g(cid:105)n that can be
achieved, e.g., by introducing a magnetic ﬁeld gradient (or
a Stark-shift gradient) in either one or two dimensions as de-
picted in Fig.1(a-b) in the main text. This site-dependent en-
ergy, together with a multi-frequency driving for |s(cid:105)n ↔ |e(cid:105)n
are the key ingredients of our proposal. Multi-frequency driv-
ing with mP different components can be described through a
Hamiltonian:

Hd(t) = ∑

(A4)

ab = |a(cid:105)n(cid:104)b|, and ωL is the
where we have used the notation σ n
main driving frequency. All components of the driving ﬁeld
are embedded in Ω(t), that can be written as

Ω(t) ≡ mP−1
∑

(A5)

14

where ˜ωα are mP different frequency detunings ( ˜ωα=0 = 0)
and Ωα the Rabi frequency that will be used to achieve full
control of the atom-atom interactions. The dynamics of the
system is described by the sum of all the above Hamiltonians:
H = Ha + HGM + Hd(t) + Hlm.
We are interested in the conditions where |∆| = |ωe −
ωL| (cid:29) Ω, such that the excited states are only virtually pop-
ulated. To adiabatically eliminate states |e(cid:105)n, it is conve-
nient to work in a rotating frame deﬁned by the transfor-
forms the Hamiltonian by H → UHU † − iU∂tU †. Writing
each of the transformed Hamiltonians, we have

eet + i∑k ωka†kak)t(cid:1), which trans-

mation U = exp(cid:0)i(∑n ωLσ n

it is proportional to the number of GM photons, which is close
to 0 in our situation [31, 32]. Rewriting the effective Hamilto-
nian in the interaction picture with respect to ˜Heff,a, we arrive
at the following light-matter Hamiltonian

while HGM transforms to zero. Notice that, due to the multi-
frequency driving, it is not possible to ﬁnd a reference frame
where the Hamiltonian is time-independent. In spite of the
time dependence, it is still possible to adiabatically eliminate
the excited states. For this purposes, we deﬁne a projector
operator for the atomic subspace, P = ∑n(σ n
ss), that
projects out the excited states, and its orthogonal counter part,
Q = ∑n σ n
ee. Using these operators, one can formally project
out slow and fast subspaces in the Schr¨odinger equation:

(A7)
By using the fact that QHQ is actually time-independent
and assuming that initially there are no contributions from the
excited states, i.e., Q|Ψ(0)(cid:105) = 0, one can formally integrate
Q|Ψ(cid:105) (by parts), input the result into the equation of P|Ψ(cid:105),
and obtain an effective Hamiltonian for the slow subspace:

limitations and other error sources.

icality much faster than the atomic ones, such that we can

trol Jm,n at each distance rm,n, we need to introduce enough
sidebands to cover all the energy differences ωg,m − ωg,n.

Hxy,0 is much smaller than the minimum energy detuning
δω ≡ min{|ωg,n−ωg,m|} between different sites, that is δω (cid:29)
ΩαΩβ /(4∆2), the time-dependent processes will be highly
off-resonant, yielding the ideal Hamiltonian Hxy(t) ≈ Hxy,0.
In practical situations, δω will be a limited resource because
of the requirement for large ﬁeld gradient over the distance
of a PCW unit cell. Thus, in the main text and in Appendix
F, we discuss errors created by the time-dependent processes,
and strategies to minimize the errors.

As a last remark, if we explicitly write down the phase de-
pendence of the Raman pump in Eq. (A22), it follows that
Jm,n ≡ |Jm,n|eikL·rm,n (and now Jm,n = Jn,m for kL · rm,n = 0). If
the illumination is not perfectly transverse, that is, kL · rm,n (cid:54)=
0, then Hxy,0 acquires spatial-dependent, complex coupling
coefﬁcients:

which gives us the possibility to engineer geometrical phases

the above simple expression, we are assuming kα = kL being
a constant for all different sidebands Ωα.

Independent control of XX and YY interactions

So far, we have been able to engineer full control of spin-
exchange or XY Hamiltonians. In this Section, we will show
how by slight modiﬁcation of the atomic level structure, we
can engineer the XX and YY terms independently. In particu-
lar, we use a butterﬂy-like structure as depicted in Fig. 3 (b),
where there are two transitions coupled to the GMs, i.e.,
|g(cid:105) ↔ |e(cid:105) and |s(cid:105) ↔ | ˜e(cid:105) and two different multi-frequency
Raman ﬁelds, Ωg(t) and Ωs(t). Assuming that we have co-
propagating beams or perfectly transverse illumination, i.e.,
kL · rm,n = 0, we can adiabatically eliminate the excited states
|e(cid:105) and | ˜e(cid:105) following a similar procedure as in the previous
Section [Eq .(A10)] to obtain an effective light-matter Hamil-

tive range of the interaction; ∆xy = |ωc − ωL| is the effective
detuning with respect to the band edge, and A the curvature of
the band [see Fig. 1(c)]. Notice that there is another under-
lying assumption in the derivation, namely, that the coupling
strength |gk|2 of the driven GMs must be approximately con-
stant for all the sideband frequencies ωL + ˜ωα. If not, the vari-
ation of |gk|2 can be compensated by adjusting sideband am-
plitudes Ωα. Furthermore, since we focus on full control in-
troduced by multi-frequency drivings, we will not specify the
form of ˜Jm,n and simply assume a constant ˜Jm,n = ˜J through-
out the interaction range considered. However, one should be
aware that the length scale ξ will pose the ultimate limitation
of the range of the interactions that we can simulate.

with the rest of the sidebands being off-resonant; Fig. 2 (b)

can create site dependent XX, YY or XY terms.

Appendix B: Proper choice of ground state energy shifts in 2D

models

For generic 2D lattice models, we need to introduce ground
state energy shifts between sites (m,n) separated by rm,n =
rm − rn to engineer the interaction between them. The en-
ergy shifts need to be unique for speciﬁc site separation vec-
tor rm,n, but should be independent of rm to preserve trans-
lational invariance, which is generally required for spin lat-
tice models. To do this, we can introduce a linear magnetic
ﬁeld gradient ∇B· al ≡ Bl, where al (l = 1,2) are the Bravais
vectors of a unit cell. We require that the ratio q = B1/B2
of B-ﬁeld gradients along two Bravais vectors be an irra-
tional number such that, for any rn = (nx,ny) with nx,ny ∈ Z,
ωg,n = µB(nx×q+ny)B2 is a unique number. As a result, each
sideband can only induce a resonant interaction at a speciﬁc
separation rm,n. Moreover, we also need to ensure that there
exists no rm such that |ωg,m−ωg,n| (cid:46) Jm,n that can lead to sig-
niﬁcant time-dependent terms in Eq. (6) of the main text. In
general, for a ﬁnite size system, this situation can be avoided.

• Uniform NN coupling along ˆy: This term can be real-
ized with a sideband of detuning δy and Xy(rn + ∆ry) =
−|Ω1|
2∆ e−i(ny+1)π, pairing with the strong pump ﬁeld
|Ω0|
2∆ e−inyπ which propagates along ˆy. The re-
X0(rn) =
sulting coupling coefﬁcient is t1 = ˜J|X0||Xy|. This term
can also be extended to engineer non-uniform coupling
coefﬁcients; see the following discussion.

• Checkerboard-like NN coupling along ˆx: We introduce
a sideband of detuning δx and amplitude Xx(rn +∆rx) =
|Ω|
4∆ [e−inyπ + ζ e−i(nx+1)π ], formed by two ﬁelds propa-
gating along ˆy and ˆx, respectively. If both ﬁelds have
the same amplitude (ζ = 1), they either add up or can-
cel completely depending on whether nx + ny is odd or
even. The resulting coupling rate is real with amplitude

(cid:2)1− (−1)nx−ny(cid:3) ,

and vanishes exactly in a checkerboard pattern. If one
applies the same trick toward NN coupling along ˆy, but
with ζ (cid:54)= 1, the coupling amplitude also modulates in
a checkerboard pattern. Essentially all three NN terms
that from a brick-wall vertex can be independently con-
trolled, opening up further possibility to engineer, for
example, Kitaev’s honeycomb lattice model [61, 62].

• Complex NNN and NNNN couplings: The NNNN terms
can be similarly generated by using a sideband of
|Ω2|
2∆ [e−i(ny+2)π +
detuning 2δy, and X2y(rn + ∆r2y) =
iζ e−inxπ ], formed by two initially π/2 out-of-phase
ﬁelds propagating respectively along ˆy and ˆx. The same
trick can be used for NNN couplings using sidebands of
detunings δxy,δxy∗ respectively. The coupling phase φ,
can be arbitrarily controlled by the amplitude ratio ζ , as
we showed in Eq. (18) in the main text.

(cid:19)

To engineer this model, again only two pump beams can
introduce all components required in the Raman ﬁeld. We can
write down the ˆx-, ˆy-propagating ﬁelds with amplitude mod-
ulations (that is, with equal blue- and red-sideband contribu-
tions), for the ﬁeld propagating along ˆy, we have

εy(t) = ε0 + ε1

cosδxt − cosδyt

+ ε2 (cos2δyt − cosδxyt − cosδxy∗t) ,

(C3)

and, for the ﬁeld propagating along ˆx, we require

εx(t) =

cosδxt − iζε2 (cos2δyt + cosδxyt − cosδxy∗t) .

(C4)

in a brick-wall conﬁguration. Introducing a strong pump ﬁeld
of amplitude Ω0, propagating along ˆy, we can engineer the
interaction terms one-by-one as the following:

One may similarly replace amplitude modulations cosδαt by
frequency modulation e−iδαt to engineer the spin model, as in
Eqs. (19-20) in the main text.

where an effective magnetic ﬁeld B that controls the number
of excitations can be introduced by the detuning of address-
ing beams; The parameter θ determines the relative strength
between the ZZ and XY interactions.

We can simulate any η and θ in a 2D PCW as follows:
• First, we require the decay length scale ξ to be suf-
ﬁciently large such that GM photon coupling strength
˜J(rm,n) is only limited by the energy spread in the
low dimensional reservoir. For example, in 2D with
quadratic dispersion as depicted in Fig. 1(d) of the main
text, one can simulate any interaction that decays faster
than K0(|rm,n|/ξ ) ≈ log(ξ /|rm,n|), where K0(x) is the
modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind [31, 32]
(Appendix A).
• Then, in order to simulate the |rn − rm|−η dependence,
we introduce a linear magnetic ﬁeld gradient ∇B or
linear ground state energy shifts as described in Ap-
pendix B.

• Thus, as we did in the previous discussions, we in-
troduce a strong pump ﬁeld of amplitude Ω0 together
with Nd auxiliary ﬁelds Ωα of detuning δα to cover all
the different separations rm,n. For example, to simu-
late a square lattice of ns × ns (= N) atomic spins, we
can see that the number of different distances grows as
Nd = ns(ns+1)−2
, linearly proportional to the number of
atoms Nd ∝ N.

2

• Finally, the parameter θ that determines the ratio be-
tween ZZ and XY interaction can be controlled by using
different pump intensities when doing the stroboscopic
evolution (see Section ).

Appendix E: Engineering a two-step Hamiltonian for error

reduction

As derived in Section A, the resulting time-dependent
couplings introduced by a multi-frequency pump is H(t) =
∑p Hpeipδt, where Hp represents the part in the Hamiltonian
that oscillates with frequency pδ . The time-dependent Hamil-
tonian has a period T = 2π/δ , and it can be shown that the
effective Hamiltonian that repeats every time-period T , i.e.,

Heff,1 ≈ H0 +

,

This means that if we apply the multi-frequency pumps just as
we explained in the previous sections, the leading error would
be on the order of J2/δ , where J is the interaction strength that
we want to simulate. However, we also observe that the lead-
ing error term ∑p[Hp,H−p]/(pδ ) vanishes if Hp = ±H−p. In
other words, ﬁrst order error vanishes if Hp is either symmet-
ric or anti-symmetric under time-reversal operation T . While
the original Hamiltonian H(t) doesn’t necessarily posses such
symmetry, it is possible to introduce a two-step periodic op-
eration H2step = {H, T H,H, T H, ...} to cancel the ﬁrst order
error while keeping the time-independent part H2step,0 = H0
identical. This reduces the leading error to the order of J3/δ 2.
To achieve the time-reversal operation, we must reverse the
phase of the driving lasers, as well as the sign of the energy
offsets between the atoms. Speciﬁcally, we can engineer the
two-step Hamiltonian as follows:

• After applying a proper magnetic (or Stark-shift) gra-
dient to ensure a position dependent energy shift, we
apply sidebands using either frequency or amplitude
modulations to engineer the Hamiltonian H0 following
Eq. (A22).

• After a time T = 2π/δ , we ﬂip the sign of the gradi-
ent. In 1D, if ωg,n − ωg,m = |n− m|δ , then we switch
to ωg,n − ωg,m = −|n − m|δ . Meanwhile, we also re-
verse the propagation direction of the Raman ﬁelds such
that Xα → X∗
α. As a result, all the time-dependent
Hamiltonians Hp, ∀p (cid:54)= 0, become H−p in the second
step. Whereas, the time-independent Hamiltonian H0
remains identical. After holding for an evolution time
T = 2π/δ , we repeat the ﬁrst step.

To formally prove that the above idea leads to smaller error,

we can write our two step periodic Hamiltonian as follows:

H2step(t) = H(t)T (t) + H(−t)T (t − T ),

(E2)
where T (t) is a periodic square-wave envelope, controlling the
on and off of H(t) at time interval [0,T ] within a period 2T .
T (t) can be expanded as follows

We therefore see that as long as ∆g = ∆s, there is no error due
to time-dependent Stark shifts as a result that both |g(cid:105) and |s(cid:105)
states are shifted exactly the same way. However, one may
ﬁnd that the atomic level structure for a butterﬂy scheme dic-
tates that ∆g (cid:54)= ∆s. As a result, we ﬁnd [[ ˜Hac,p,H0], ˜Hac,p] (cid:54)= 0
p ≡ ˜Ap are in-
even for translational-invariant models, where ˜An
dependent of sites. This is in contrast to the case of XY Hamil-
tonians with the Raman ﬁeld driving only one ground state. It

is however still possible to minimize the error contribution by
driving with ˜J > ∆ and δ (cid:29) J, as the criterion needed for sub-
lattice models; see main text.
In the case of strong driving with ∆g (cid:54)= ∆s and ∆ > ˜J, the
commutator [[ ˜Hac,p,H0], ˜Hac,p] can be made as the dominant
‘error’ contribution. Interestingly, as seen from Eq. (F6), this
‘error’ term is in fact also driving XX and YY interactions. It
is therefore desirable to take the Stark shift contribution into
account while ﬁnding the proper pump ﬁelds to create the tar-
get Hamiltonians.
