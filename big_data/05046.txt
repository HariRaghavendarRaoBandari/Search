Abstract. This paper establishes existence of solutions for a partial diﬀerential equation in which a diﬀerential
operator involving variable exponent growth conditions is present. This operator represents a generalization of the
p(·)-Laplace operator, i.e. ∆p(·)u = div(|∇u|p(·)−2∇u), where p(·) is a continuous function. The proof of the main
result is based on Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem combined with adequate variational arguments. The function
space setting used here makes appeal to the variable exponent Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces.

Introduction

Let Ω ⊂ RN (N ≥ 2) be a bounded domain with smooth boundary ∂Ω. Let p(·) : Ω → (2, ∞) be a
continuous function such that

λ1 :=

inf
0 (Ω)\{0}

u∈C∞

> 0 .

|u|p(x) dx

(1)

|∇u|p(x) dx

ZΩ
ZΩ

We point out that property λ1 > 0 is not true for all functions p(·). For instance, assuming that there
exists an open set U ⊂ Ω and a point x0 ∈ U such that p(x0) < p(x) (or p(x0) > p(x)) for all x ∈ ∂U ,
then by [10, Theorem 3.1] we get λ1 = 0. On the other hand, there are results establishing suﬃcient
conditions on p(·) in order to satisfy λ1 > 0. Indeed, it was proved in [10, Theorem 3.3] that assuming
that there exists a vector l ∈ RN \ {0} such that, for any x ∈ Ω, the function f (t) = p(x + tl) is monotone,
for t ∈ Ix := {s; x + sl ∈ Ω} then λ1 > 0. Furthermore, it was shown in [15, Theorem 1] that (1) holds
provided that p(·) ∈ C1(Ω; R) and that there exists −→a ∈ C1(Ω; RN ) such that div−→a (x) ≥ a0 > 0 and
−→a (x) · ∇p(x) = 0, for every x ∈ Ω (see also [14, Theorem 1] for similar results). Finally, we recall a very
well-known fact that in the special case when p(·) is a constant function (deﬁned on the interval (1, ∞))
then (1) holds.

Next, assume that A : Ω → RN 2

L∞(Ω) ∩ C1(Ω) and

is a symmetric function matrix, i.e. aij = aji, such that aij ∈

hAξ, ξi =

N

Xi,j=1

aij(x)ξiξj ≥ |ξ|2, ∀ x ∈ Ω, ξ ∈ RN ,

where h·, ·i denotes the scalar product on RN .

In this paper we are concerned with the study of nonlinear and nonhomogeneous problems of type

for x ∈ ∂Ω ,

It represents a generalization of the p(·)-Laplace operator,

where α : Ω × R → (0, ∞) is a bounded function and f : Ω → R is a measurable function belonging to
a suitable Lebesgue type space which will be speciﬁed later on in the paper. The diﬀerential operator
2 A∇u) and will be called
involved in equation (3) will be denoted by Ap(·) := div(α(x, u)hA∇u, ∇ui
the Ap(·)-Laplace operator.
i.e. ∆p(·)u =
div(|∇u|p(·)−2∇u), which is obtained in the case when A = Id and α ≡ 1. In the last decades special
attention has been paid to p(·)-Laplace type operators since they can model with suﬃcient accuracy the
phenomena arising from the study of electrorheological ﬂuids (Ruˇziˇcka [19], Rajagopal & Ruˇziˇcka [16]),
image restoration (Chen et al. [6]), mathematical biology (Fragnelli [11]), dielectric breakdown, electrical
resistivity and polycrystal plasticity (Bocea & Mih˘ailescu [2], Bocea et al. [4]) or they arise in the study
of some models for growth of heterogeneous sandpiles (Bocea et al.
[3]). In a similar context, we note
that a collection of results obtained in the ﬁeld of partial diﬀerential equations involving p(·)-Laplace type
operators can be found in the survey paper by Harjulehto et al. [12]. Finally, we recall that in the case
when p(·) is a constant function, problems involving Ap-Laplace type operators have been widely studied.
In this regard we point out the papers by Reshetnyak [17], Alvino et al. [1] and El Khalil et al. [9] and
the references therein.

2 A review on variable exponent spaces

In this section we provide a brief review of basic properties of the variable exponent Lebesgue-Sobolev
spaces. For more details we refer to the book by Diening et al. [7] and the paper by Kovacik and R´akosn´ık
[13].

In this paper we reduce all our discussion to the special case when Ω ⊂ RN is an open bounded set.

For any continuous function p : Ω → (1, ∞) we deﬁne

p− := inf
x∈Ω

p(x) and p+ := sup
x∈Ω

p(x).

Next, we deﬁne the variable exponent Lebesgue space Lp(·)(Ω) by

Lp(·)(Ω) =(cid:26)u : Ω → R measurable : ZΩ

|u(x)|p(x) dx < ∞(cid:27) .

Clearly, Lp(·)(Ω) is a Banach space when endowed with the so-called Luxemburg norm, deﬁned by

p(x)

u(x)

|u|p(·) := inf(µ > 0 : ZΩ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
kukLp(Ω) :=(cid:18)ZΩ

µ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
|u(x)|pdx(cid:19)1/p

dx ≤ 1) .

.

We note that the variable exponent Lebesgue space is a special case of an Orlicz-Musielak space. For
constant functions p, Lp(·)(Ω) reduces to the classical Lebesgue space Lp(Ω), endowed with the standard
norm

We recall that Lp(·)(Ω) is separable and reﬂexive. Since Ω is bounded, if p1, p2 are variable exponents
such that p1 ≤ p2 in Ω, the embedding Lp2(·)(Ω) ֒→ Lp1(·)(Ω) is continuous and its norm does not exceed
|Ω| + 1.

We denote by Lp

′

(·)(Ω) the conjugate space of Lp(·)(Ω), where 1/p(x)+1/p

′

(x) = 1. For any u ∈ Lp(·)(Ω)

and v ∈ Lp

′

(·)(Ω) the following H¨older type inequality

holds.

A key role in manipulating the variable exponent Lebesgue and Sobolev (see below) spaces is played

by the modular of the space Lp(·)(Ω), which is the mapping ρp(·) : Lp(·)(Ω) → R deﬁned by

If u ∈ Lp(·)(Ω) then the following relations hold:

ρp(·)(u) :=ZΩ

|u(x)|p(x) dx.

|u|p(·) > 1 ⇒ |u|p−

p(·) ≤ ρp(·)(u) ≤ |u|p+

p(·) ;

|u|p(·) < 1 ⇒ |u|p+

p(·) ≤ ρp(·)(u) ≤ |u|p−

p(·) ;

The variable exponent Sobolev space W 1,p(·)(Ω) is deﬁned by

|u|p(·) = 1 ⇔ ρp(·)(u) = 1 .

W 1,p(·)(Ω) := {u ∈ Lp(·)(Ω) :

|∇u| ∈ Lp(·)(Ω)}.

On this space one can consider the following norm

kukp(·) := |u|p(·) + |∇u|p(·),

(5)

(6)

(7)

where, in the above deﬁnition |∇u|p(·) stands for the Luxemburg norm of |∇u|. We note that in the
context of this discussion that W 1,p(·)(Ω) is also a separable and reﬂexive Banach space.

Finally, we deﬁne W 1,p(·)

0

(Ω) as the closure of C∞

0 (Ω) under the norm

kuk = |∇u|p(·).

0

Note that (W 1,p(·)
is a continuous function such that q(x) < p⋆(x) for all x ∈ Ω then the embedding W 1,p(·)
is compact and continuous, where p⋆(x) = N p(x)
N −p(x) if p(x) < N or p⋆(x) = +∞ if p(x) ≥ N .

(Ω), k·k) is also a separable and reﬂexive Banach space. We remark that if q : Ω → (1, ∞)
(Ω) ֒→ Lq(·)(Ω)

3 The main result

The main result of this paper is given by the following theorem.

Theorem 1. Assume that α : Ω × R → R is a Carath´eodory function for which there exist two positive
constants 0 < λ ≤ Λ such that:

0 < λ ≤ α(x, t) ≤ Λ, a.e. x ∈ Ω, ∀ t ∈ R .

Assume that conditions (1) and (2) from Section 1 are satisﬁed. Then for each f ∈ Lp

4 Proof of the main result

Fix an arbitrary function f ∈ Lp
ﬁxed point theorem:

(·)(Ω). The main ingredient of our proof of Theorem 1 will be Schauder’s

Schauder’s Fixed Point Theorem. Assume that K is a compact and convex subset of the Banach space
B and S : K → K is a continuous map. Then S possesses a ﬁxed point.

We start by proving some auxiliary results which will be useful in establishing Theorem 1.

Lemma 1. For each v ∈ Lp(·)(Ω) the problem

(Ω).

(9)

(10)

Proof. Fix v ∈ Lp(·)(Ω). First, we note that condition (8) from Theorem 1 guarantees that α(x, v) ∈

L∞(Ω).

Consider the energy functional associated with problem (9), J : W 1,p(·)

(Ω) → R,

J(u) =ZΩ

α(x, v)

f ϕ dx ,

(Ω). Thus, weak solutions of problem (9) are exactly the critical points of the

for all u, ϕ ∈ W 1,p(·)
functional J.

Since (2) and (8) are fulﬁlled it follows that for each u ∈ W 1,p(·)

(Ω) with kuk > 1 we have

where c is a positive constant. The above estimate shows that J is coercive.

On the other hand, it was pointed out in [1, p. 449] that the following Clarkson’s type inequality

2 (cid:19) ,

,

(11)

holds for all s ≥ 2 and ξ1, ξ2 ∈ RN . Thus, we deduce that J is convex and consequently weakly lower
semi-continuous.

Since J is coercive and weakly lower semi-continuous we conclude via the Direct Method of the Calculus
(Ω)
(cid:3)

of Variations (see, e.g. [20, Theorem 1.2 ]), that there exists a global minimum point of J, u ∈ W 1,p(·)
and consequently a weak solution of problem (9). The proof of Lemma 1 is thus complete.

Next, for each v ∈ Lp(·)(Ω) let u = T (v) ∈ W 1,p(·)

Lemma 1. Thus, we can actually introduce an application T : Lp(·)(Ω) → W 1,p(·)

Proof. Taking ϕ = T (v) in (10) we ﬁnd

Taking into account relation (8) and condition (2), the above equality yields

λZΩ

|∇T (v)|p(x) dx ≤ZΩ

f T (v) dx, ∀ v ∈ Lp(·)(Ω) .

(13)

Let now ǫ > 0 be such that ǫ < min{1, λ, λ/λ1}. Then, by Young’s inequality (see, e.g. [5, the footnote
on p. 56]) we deduce

f (x)T (v(x)) ≤

ǫp(x)−1 |f (x)|p

(x) + ǫ|T (v(x))|p(x), ∀ v ∈ Lp(·)(Ω), x ∈ Ω ,

or, since ǫ ∈ (0, 1) there exists Cǫ := 1

ǫp+−1 such that

f (x)T (v(x)) ≤ Cǫ|f (x)|p

′

(x) + ǫ|T (v(x))|p(x), ∀ v ∈ Lp(·)(Ω), x ∈ Ω .

Integrating the above estimate over Ω and taking into account that relations (1) and (13) hold we get

we infer that relation (12) holds true. The proof of Lemma 2 is thus also complete.

Remark 1. By Lemma 2 and relation (1) it clearly follows that there exists a universal constant C1 > 0
such that

|T (v)|p(x) dx ≤ C1, ∀ v ∈ Lp(·)(Ω) .

Lemma 3. The map T : Lp(·)(Ω) → W 1,p(·)

(Ω) is continuous.

Proof. Let (vn), v ⊂ Lp(·)(Ω) be such that vn converges to v in Lp(·)(Ω) as n → ∞. Set

un := T (vn), ∀ n .

By Lemma 2 we have

ZΩ

|∇un|p(x) dx =ZΩ

|∇T (vn)|p(x) dx ≤ C, ∀ n ,

i.e. (un) is bounded on W 1,p(·)

This fact and relation (8) yield

hA∇un, ∇un − ∇ui dx = o(1) .

Next, by taking ϕ = un in (14) we get

2 dx =ZΩ

f un dx ,

for each n. Relation (8), H¨older’s inequality, Poincar´e’s inequality and the fact that (un) is bounded on

Furthermore, recalling relation (11) and the fact that p(x) ≥ 2 for all x ∈ Ω, we deduce that the map

On the other hand, using relation (A.2) in [1], i.e.

Proof of Theorem 1. Let C1 be the constant given in Remark 1, i.e.

|S(v)|p(x) dx ≤ C1, ∀ v ∈ Lp(·)(Ω) .

ZΩ

Consider the ball

BC1(0) := {v ∈ Lp(·)(Ω) : ZΩ

|v|p(x) dx ≤ C1} .

Clearly, BC1(0) is a convex closed subset of Lp(·)(Ω) and S(BC1(0)) ⊂ BC1(0). Moreover, by Remark 2,
S(BC1(0)) is relatively compact in BC1(0).

Finally, by Lemma 3 and Remark 2, S : BC1(0) → BC1 (0) is a continuous map. Hence we can apply
Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem to obtain S with a ﬁxed point. This gives us a weak solution to problem
(3) and thus the proof of Theorem 1 is ﬁnally complete.
