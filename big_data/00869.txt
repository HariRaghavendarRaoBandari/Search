Abstract
We present evidence of a novel form of group hunting. Group hunting sailﬁsh (Istiophorus platypterus)
alternate attacks on their schooling prey (Sardinella aurita). While only 23% of attacks result in prey capture,
multiple prey are injured in 95% of attacks, resulting in an increase of injured ﬁsh in the school with the
number of attacks. How quickly prey are captured is positively correlated with the level of injury of the
school, suggesting that hunters can beneﬁt from other conspeciﬁcs’ attacks on the prey. To explore this,
we built a mathematical model capturing the dynamics of the hunt. We show that group hunting provides
major eﬃciency gains (prey caught per unit time) for individuals in groups of up to 70 members. We also
demonstrate that a free riding strategy, where some individuals wait until the prey are suﬃciently injured before
attacking, is unlikely to be beneﬁcial. This form of group hunting provides evidence that cooperative beneﬁts
can be realised through the facilitative eﬀects of individuals’ hunting actions without spatial coordination of
attacks. Such ‘proto-cooperation’ may be the pre-cursor to more complex group-hunting strategies.

Introduction
Group hunting is a fascinating example of social behaviour that can be observed in insects [1,2], ﬁshes [3–7],
birds [8,9] and mammals [10,11]. The level of coordination between individuals during hunts, both within and
between these taxa, varies considerably.
In its simplest form, group hunting involves hunters attacking prey
together with little or no coordination of attacks while the most complex form, collaborative hunting, involves
individuals adopting speciﬁc hunting roles to herd and catch their prey [12–14].

Explaining the origins and maintenance of group hunting, however, remains unresolved. Despite group
hunting allowing some species to catch considerably larger prey [12,15,16] as well as increasing the likelihood
of making a kill [15], individuals do not necessarily increase the amount of prey they consume when hunting
together (compared to when hunting alone). For example, food intake per individual wolf (Canis lupus) can be
lower in larger packs compared to smaller hunting groups or lone individuals [17], and lions (Panthera leo) do
not always hunt in group sizes that optimise the amount of prey they consume [18]. Factors including limiting

the access of kleptoparasites to the kill, the distance travelled during a hunt, and the likelihood of being injured
by the prey, can also be important in explaining the existence of group hunting in some taxa [15,19,20].
When hunters attack smaller grouping prey, the reasons for group hunting initially appear clearer.

In
some cases, group hunters use their superior speed and coordinated attacks to disrupt and fragment prey
groups [3,21,22]. Groups of piscivorous ﬁsh, for example, have a higher probability of breaking up prey schools
and capture more prey than single attackers [21]. Groups of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae)
employ bubble-nets to capture schooling ﬁsh [23,24] and various dolphin species have been described to use
cooperative hunting strategies [16, 25]. Raptors have similarly been observed to use spatially-coordinated
attacks to hunt ﬂocking passerines [8, 9]. Spatially coordinated attacks appear to break down the collective
defences of grouping prey, thereby increasing consumption rates for group hunters. But how did these more
complex coordinated attacks evolve from simpler forms of group hunting?

In their simplest form, apparent group hunts may simply be a byproduct of clumped prey distribution, when
hunters join others by eavesdropping on the cues produced from hunters ﬁnding ephemeral food patches [10].
Cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), for example, aggregate where prey are highly abundant, with feeding rates and
prey density being closely linked [26].
In these cases, it is unclear whether the presence of other hunters
beneﬁts individuals’ hunting success.
In other cases, the presence of other hunters can increase hunting
success, even though hunters’ attacks are not coordinated in space. Lionﬁsh (Dendrochirus zebra) alternate
attacks on schooling prey and catch more prey when hunting in pairs than when alone [4]. Group hunting in a
weakly electric ﬁsh (Mormyrops anguilloides) does not appear to be spatially coordinated, and instead hunters
may beneﬁt from prey ﬂeeing in their direction when prey escape another hunter’s failed attack [27]. Black
headed-gulls (Larus ridibundus) capture twice as many ﬁsh when hunting in groups of six than when hunting
alone, even though attacks are uncoordinated [28]. If individuals can beneﬁt from the hunting actions of others
without spatial coordination of attacks, then these group hunts could explain the origins of more complex group
hunting strategies. But the mechanisms allowing increased capture rates for individuals with uncoordinated
attacks remain unclear. One possibility is that the alternation of attacks gives hunters the opportunity to
save energy, whist others exhaust and injure the prey. This could allow individuals to beneﬁt from increased
capture success during later attacks if it is easier to catch tired, injured prey. Here we investigate whether
such a strategy could beneﬁt individual hunters in groups. We investigated group hunting sailﬁsh (Istiophorus
platypterus) that alternate their attacks on schooling sardine prey (Sardinella aurita) [29, 30]. Attacks by

attacks the school at the same time.

We ﬁrst used behavioural observations and image analyses to record the hunting strategies of sailﬁsh.
This is the ﬁrst attempt to systematically quantify the group hunting strategies of sailﬁsh, which can only
be done in the wild. This puts strong constraints on the type and quantity of data we could record. To
complement our empirical work, therefore, we used a used a mathematical model, to test whether the attack-
alternation strategy we observed could be eﬀective at allowing predators to increase their capture success
beyond that possible for a solitary sailﬁsh. We hypothesised that group hunting would allow individuals to
capture more sardines per unit time using this strategy compared to if they hunted alone. Further, we evaluate
the predator group sizes where this attack-alternation strategy is beneﬁcial over solo hunting under diﬀerent
hunting conditions. We also evaluate whether this form of group hunting is likely to be exploited by free riders,
i.e. individuals that wait until the school is suﬃciently injured before attacking.

Results
Sailﬁsh Group Hunting Behaviour
Sailﬁsh were observed in groups of ∼ 6-40 individuals hunting sardine schools that diﬀered in size from tens
to thousands of individuals. However, due to observational limitations, we could not determine the exact
number of sailﬁsh that were hunting each sardine school. We observed the sailﬁsh separating smaller schools
of sardines from larger ones containing thousands of ﬁsh. The sailﬁsh then herded these smaller schools to the
surface where the last stage of the hunt occurred. At this stage, the sardine schools (n = 8) diﬀered in number
from approximately 25 to 100 - 150 ﬁsh (Fig. A1a; see Appendix section 1.1). Diﬀerent sailﬁsh alternated
their attacks on the sardine schools. Individual identiﬁcation of all sailﬁsh was not possible, and therefore we
could not determine the order in which individual sailﬁsh attacked the prey school. The median time between
consecutive approaches by diﬀerent sailﬁsh was 6.5 seconds (Fig. A1b; see Appendix section 1.2). There was
no relationship between the time between approaches and the sardine school size (Spearman Correlation; ρ =
0.11, n = 7, P = 0.84). The median length of individuals’ attacks was 2.6 seconds, but again, this was not
related to school size (Spearman Correlation; ρ = -0.21, n = 7, P = 0.66). Note, we did not observe any
attacks on one of the schools we recorded. A sailﬁsh’s attack was interrupted by another sailﬁsh 19% of the
time, after which either one or both sailﬁsh would abandon their attack.

During attacks, sailﬁsh used their bills to ‘tap’ or ‘slash’ at the sardines in an attempt to capture individual
ﬁsh (Movie 1) [29]. Only 23% of these attacks resulted in a successful capture and we never observed a sailﬁsh
to handle or ingest two or more ﬁsh at once. However, both the mean and the median number of sardines
that were hit with a sailﬁsh’s bill during an attack was 2.0 (Fig. 1a). Whilst the attacks with the bill were very
rarely observed to kill the sardines outright, sardines’ scales were removed when contact was made between
the sailﬁsh’s bills and the sardines’ bodies in 95% of cases. Because more ﬁsh were injured per attack than
were caught, this led to many sardines in the schools having pronounced injuries on their bodies, accumulated
from past attacks (Fig. 1b). The most heavily damaged ﬁsh had over 20% of their body covered in injuries
(Fig. A1c and Appendix section 1.3).
We observed successful captures (n = 47) on six of the eight sardine schools we recorded. Sailﬁsh caught
individual sardines at an average rate (across all the schools) of 0.71 ± 0.18 SE sardines per minute. By
quantifying the proportion of the school that was injured (Fig. 1 c&d; see methods for details), we found a
positive correlation between the school’s injury level and the capture rate (Spearman Correlation; ρ = 0.82, n
= 7, P = 0.03; Fig. 1e); sardines in more injured schools were captured more quickly. Given the observational
constraints, we could not determine whether it was the most injured ﬁsh in the shoal that were captured next,
however, we often observed injured sardines breaking oﬀ from the prey schools that presumably could not
keep pace with the school. These individuals were quickly captured by the sailﬁsh (Movie 2). There were
weak negative correlations between capture success rates and school size (Spearman Correlation; ρ = -0.54,

results).

Modelling Group Hunting
Because capture rates were most strongly correlated with the proportion of the school that was injured, we
concentrated on modelling this aspect of the hunt. It appears that sailﬁsh could use a strategy to progressively
injure prey over time, thereby increasing their capture success rates in later attacks. But why would it not be
possible for a single sailﬁsh to get these beneﬁts from multiple attacks on a school, and why do the sailﬁsh
hunt in groups? Basic biomechanics predict that small prey (sardine average body length is ∼ 19 cm [29]) are
more manoeuvrable than larger predators [31, 32] (sailﬁsh are ∼ 200 - 250 cm). If the sardines can perform
one or more sharp turns, removing a sailﬁsh’s potential for attack, then a sailﬁsh is likely to abandon its attack
due to its lower manoeuvrability. Meanwhile, this gives another sailﬁsh an opportunity to initiate its attack
sequence. Our data on high levels of approach rates (every 6.5 s) appear to support this interpretation. To
better understand why sailﬁsh hunt in groups, we built a simple mathematical model to capture the dynamics
of the hunt. We consider a group of N = const. predators (sailﬁsh), hunting a group of initially S(t = 0) = S0
prey (sardines). Each predator needs a ﬁnite time to perform an attack τa and after an attack it requires a
ﬁnite time τr to be ready for the next attack. The attacking predator has the probability pc to catch a single
prey. During each attack, there is also a chance that prey are injured. Since it is unclear how the injuries are
distributed among individuals, we introduce a global measure of injury in the prey school I. The observed
correlation between the level of injury of a school and the capture success rate suggests that the capture
probability is a monotonically increasing function of the injury level in the prey school pc = pc(I) (Fig. 2a).
The capture probability pc(I) can never exceed 1, thus it has to approach pmax ≤ 1 for I → ∞. Using this,
and assuming that the global injury level increases linearly with the number of attacks, we may rewrite the
probability of capture as a function of the number of attacks na: pc(I) → pc(na) (see Fig 2a, and Appendix

A single predator needs the time ∆tsingle = τa + τr for a full attack cycle: “perform attack” (τa) and
“prepare for next attack” (τr). Thus it attacks on average only once during this time interval and the number
of attacks scales linearly with time na(t) = t/∆tsingle. If we have more than one predator, the average time
interval between two attacks by a focal individual depends on the number of predators N, whereby two cases
have to be distinguished: (i) If N is small, then on average all other hunters can perform their attacks within
the time required by the focal individual to prepare for the next attack, and the average time interval between
initiation of subsequent attacks for the focal individual is simply τa + τr. (ii) If N is larger than 1 + τr/τa
, then the focal individual will typically have to wait until other, better prepared individuals have performed
their attacks.

If we assume that at any time the individual with the longest waiting time will attack next, then typi-
cally all other hunters will perform their attacks between two subsequent attacks of the focal individual and
the corresponding time interval becomes N τa. Using this we can calculate the average number of attacks
na,s(T, N) an individual predator performs until time T in a group of size N (Fig. A2). Whilst the attack
and preparation times may vary, only their average values, τa and τr, determine the conditions where group
hunting is beneﬁcial (see Fig. A3 for an exploration of how τa and τr determine these conditions).

During the full cycle of the focal individual (“attack sequence”+“preparation/waiting time”) on average
N attacks take place, which increases the injury of the prey and therefore the capture probability. The number
of attacks performed by all hunters can thus be expressed as na = iN, with i being the number of the attacks
by a focal individual and N being the group size. We can calculate the expected number of prey captured by
a focal predator at time T by summing over all the capture probabilities pc(iN) during its subsequent attacks
i. Here we have to take into account that the total school size imposes an upper limit on the possible number
of ﬁsh caught, which is simply the average number of prey per predator S0/N. Thus the expected number of
prey captured per predator is:

hnci(T, N) = minn na,s(T,N)X

pc(iN),

(1)

with na,s(T, N) being the number of attacks performed by the focal individual in a group of N hunters, up
to an arbitrary time T, which can be interpreted as time available for hunting. For T → ∞ the expectation
value hnci is always equal to S0/N, and it has always a maximum at N = 1. Hence if time is not a limiting
factor, then it is always better for a predator to hunt alone because it would not have to share prey with
conspeciﬁcs. However, considering individuals should maximise their rates of prey capture, and not just the
absolute amount of prey caught, then it may not be beneﬁcial to hunt alone. Note that T is diﬀerent from
the actual time required to hunt down a school of sardines Ttot, which for the parameters used may vary from
6 − 8h for a single hunter to 1h for a groups larger than ten individuals (Fig. A4).

We conﬁrmed our theoretical results by performing numerical simulations of the model (see materials and
methods for details). Figures 2b and c show the number of ﬁsh captured per predator versus group size N
scaled by the number of prey a solitary hunter (N = 1) would have caught at that time (see Fig. A5 for
unscaled values). In this way we can identify the maximum group size Nm, where each individual outperforms
a solitary hunter. This depends strongly on the available hunting time. Whilst the optimal group sizes that
maximise prey intake rates per hunter are small (10 when hunting times are short (T = 0.5h) to 3 when
hunting times are long (T = 2h)), the group sizes where group hunting outweighs hunting alone are typically
much larger. For T = 0.5h we observe Nm = 70, which then quickly decreases to Nm = 30 for T = 1h and
Nm = 13 for T = 1.5h. Eventually, for T → ∞, Nm will always converge to 1 due to the ﬁnite size of the
school. At short times T, Nm is always larger than 1 + τr/τa, which is the group size at which the individual
hunters start to pay temporal costs of group hunting (Fig. A2).

text and Appendix section 2.6.

Are there beneﬁts for free riders?
This form of group hunting immediately raises questions surrounding the existence of producers and free riders
in groups. Producers (hunters that begin attacking from the start of the hunt) generate a public good where
higher levels of prey injury leads to higher capture success rates. There is the potential, therefore, for free
riders (individuals that delay their attacks for some time until the school is suﬃciently injured) to avoid paying
the costs of attacking at the beginning of the hunt where the initial capture probability is low, and proﬁt
from the higher capture probability at later stages of the hunt. In order to explore possible ﬁtness trade-oﬀs
in terms of the energy expenditure versus energy uptake, we combined the stochastic individual based model
with an energetic balance equation (See Appendix section 2.2). We consider an “optimal” situation of being a
single free rider hunting with N − 1 producers. The free rider refrains from attacking prey at the beginning of
the hunt for a time Tf r (attack delay time). Using the energy payoﬀs an individual receives during the hunt,
∆etotal,i, we can calculate the relative energy payoﬀ of an individual fi within a population:

fi = ∆etotal,i − min(∆etotal,i)

max(∆etotal,i) − min(∆etotal,i)

(2)

which scales between 0 for minimal energy payoﬀ and 1 for maximal energy payoﬀ. Here, ∆etotal,i is a
function of a sailﬁsh’s base energy expenditure (the energy needed to simply remain with the prey school),
the energy required to perform attacks, and the energy received by the captures it makes during a hunt (See
Appendix section 2.3).

In order to assess possible energy beneﬁts of free-riders, we calculated the diﬀerence between the average

relative energy payoﬀ of free riders and producers

∆f = hfif r − hfiprod.

(3)

Positive values indicate an advantage for the free riding strategy, whereas negative values indicate on average
higher energy pay-oﬀs for the producers. All results discussed were obtained by simulating 100 independent
runs for each group size N and attack delay time Tf r.

One key parameter, δc, predominantly controls whether there is an advantage for the free-riding strategy.
δc is a dimensionless number that represents the eﬀective increase of the energy expenditure during an attack
relative to the base energy expenditure. A value of δc = 1, would correspond to a doubling of the energy

An advantage for the free-riding strategy can only be observed
for very large values of δc (cid:29) 10 (Fig. 3a&b). Even then, this advantage only becomes signiﬁcant for small
hunter group sizes N < 10 or small attack delay times Tf r (Fig. 3b). Decreasing values of δc and the base
energy consumption rate, c0, make free-riding increasingly unlikely for a given group size and hunting time
(Fig. 3c). Free riding remains disadvantageous for large regions of parameter space when there is the potential
for the hunt to be interrupted (see Appendix section 2.4).

Our results suggest that the beneﬁts of group hunting, measured by the total number of ﬁsh captured per
unit time, outweigh the costs of sharing up to a group size of Nm when hunting time is limited. Further, free
riders are unlikely to beneﬁt by delaying their attacks whilst producers attack and injure prey.

Discussion
Sailﬁsh can achieve increased per capita capture rates if individuals use an attack alternation strategy whilst
hunting in groups, compared to if they hunted alone. The mechanism by which sailﬁsh collectively achieve
higher capture rates in groups makes this system highly unusual; attacks by sailﬁsh actively injure their
prey which leads to increased capture probabilities during subsequent attacks. Like other systems [27, 28],
sailﬁsh do not appear to spatially coordinate their attacks.
In fact, sailﬁsh predominantly attack the prey
schools when no other individual is doing so (presumably to reduce the risk of individuals injuring themselves
during attacks). This suggests that sailﬁsh time their attacks to generally take place after another hunter
has departed the prey school.
Indeed, temporally coordinated attacks have been observed in other species
that hunt grouping prey [4]. Whilst temporal, and not spatial coordination occurs during individuals’ attacks,
spatial coordination may occur in other aspects of the hunt. Sailﬁsh herd and chase their prey, which may
involve individuals moving to positions around the prey school that are dependent on the positions of other
hunters. Alternatively, this herding behaviour may simply be a byproduct of predators occupying empty space
around the prey school, without direct coordination between predators’ movements, unlike other group hunting
species [25]. Fine resolution sonar data will be needed to investigate these herding dynamics further. In any
case, we have demonstrated that group hunting can beneﬁt individual sailﬁsh without spatially coordinated
attacks or individuals adopting speciﬁc hunting roles. Our results also highlight that temporal, rather than
spatial coordination of attacks, may allow for simpler forms of cooperative behaviour to evolve.

Our model can be applied to any system where the likelihood of capturing prey increases as a function of
the number of attacks of previous predators. Whilst our study allows us to quantify the eﬀects the attacks have
on the prey (their injury marks), it is also likely that multiple attacks can have internal physiological eﬀects
on prey behaviour. For example, attacks over time are likely to reduce the energy stores in prey, reducing
their ability to perform escape manoeuvres or sustain high escape speeds through fatigue. Hence sustained
attacks, even without predators actively injuring their prey, could lead to increased capture success rates for
group hunters [33,34]. This may explain why in some other systems, prey intake rate increases as a function
of group size, without predators coordinating their attacks [28].

Cooperation through turn-taking strategies has been described in other systems, for example, in predator-
inspection behaviour in ﬁsh [35,36]. But the exploration of turn-taking has usually been assessed in dyads and
the role of turn-taking is not well understood in larger groups. Indeed, turn-taking strategies in larger groups
raises interesting questions regarding the potential for cheating [37]. It has previously been proposed that when
hunters attack small grouping prey that cannot be shared, there is no temptation to cheat, as not participating
in the hunt returns no pay-oﬀs [38]. However, this approach did not consider that it may be easier to catch
prey over time as they receive injuries or become exhausted. The increase in injured prey over time can be
interpreted as a public good [39], which may be susceptible to exploitation by cheaters that delay the onset of
their attacks.
In microbial communities with diﬀusing public goods, the partial monopolization of resources
due to spatial localization, may promote cooperation by denying non-producers access to resources [40, 41].
While such an explicit spatial eﬀect is likely to be absent in the highly dynamic turn-taking hunting process
of sailﬁsh, a direct analogy can be drawn via the intrinsic coupling of the production of the public good

7

and the capture of individual prey. Producers (attackers) have access to the prey school from the onset of
the hunt, albeit with low initial capture probabilities. Our investigation of the potential energetic trade-oﬀs
during the hunt suggests that individuals that delay their onset of attacks (free riders) would be unlikely to
beneﬁt from such a strategy. It is unlikely, therefore, that individuals vary the strategies they use to attack the
prey schools. Opportunistic access to the prey school, combined with the byproduct of injuring prey during
attempted captures, can promote individual hunting success in groups. We regard this form of group hunting,
which does not require explicit cooperation, as ‘proto-cooperation’.

Our results demonstrate that individuals can beneﬁt from group-hunting without speciﬁc hunting roles (as
in collaborative hunting), higher social-organisation or complex cognition. Whilst hunting in groups potentially
reduces the total amount of prey an individual is likely to catch, sailﬁsh can oﬀset this by collectively catch-
ing more prey per unit time when hunting together. This facilitative hunting method raises new questions
surrounding the evolution of cooperative behaviour in group living animals.

Materials and Methods
Research was conducted 30-70 km oﬀshore Cancun in the Gulf of Mexico (N21 28.3 -41.15 W86 38.41 -41.30).
Under snorkel, we used Casio EX-FH100 cameras (operating at 240 fps) to record sardine schools that were
being attacked by sailﬁsh. We spent 5 years recording the hunting behaviour of sailﬁsh in this way. However,
we could only perform the school injury analyses in videos when sky conditions were overcast (because we
required the light to be evenly distributed across the schools). This severely restricted the amount of data
we could use for this paper.
In total, therefore, our analyses are based on 84 minutes of video from 2012
documenting these interactions. Since we did not observe some of the behaviours and could not calculate some
of the measures for all schools, we report the number of schools used in each analysis below. The number
of sailﬁsh during these interactions ranged from 6-40, whilst the number of sardines in a group ranged from
25-1000+.

Attack and capture rates
During an attack, sailﬁsh use their rostrums to facilitate prey capture by slashing or tapping the sardines [29].
From the videos, we recorded the number of these attack events (n = 208 attacks across all schools) as
well as the number of successful prey capture events (n = 47 across all videos). Note this gives an average
capture success rate of 23%. By dividing the total number of captures by the length of the video recordings
we had recorded of particular schools, we also determined a capture rate for each school (n = 7 schools).
We recorded the number of sardines that the bill hit during these attacks (taps or slashes). This represents
the minimum number of ﬁsh hit during these attacks because some hits may not have been visible from the
camera angle. Note that for 51 out of the 208 attacks, we could not see how many ﬁsh were hit and these
events were excluded from analysis. We also determined whether we could see if some of the sardines’ scales
were removed during the attacks. Scale removal indicates injury to the sardines (Movie 1). Sometimes it was
not clear whether scales were removed or not during an attack (due to subsequent obstruction by other ﬁsh),
and therefore these ambiguous events (n = 60 attacks out of 208) were not included when calculating the
proportion of ﬁsh that were injured during an attack. It is interesting to note that the sailﬁsh bills are covered
in small denticles or micro-teeth [29,42], which likely facilitates scale removal and injury to the sardines.

Proportion of the school that was injured
We investigated what proportion of the schools had injuries. We selected 39 video stills where light contrast
across the schools was minimal. For this analysis, we only selected multiple images from the same video if
there was at least 1 minute between the two frames of interest (see Table A1 for the number of images used

8

for each school). The marks on the sardines caused by injuries from the bill have a distinctive white/pinkish
appearance, diﬀerent from other parts of the ﬁsh’s bodies or surrounding water (Fig. 1b). This allowed us to
use image analysis to determine the level of injury of ﬁsh that were found in the school. We note that this
semi-automated analysis provides information on a general level of injury, which combines both the frequency
and severity of injury into one variable. To perform this analysis, we marked a polygon around the edge of the
school, and then cleared all pixels from outside the marked polygon (setting their grey-scale intensity to 255).
We then adjusted the brightness and contrast of each image so that only the injury marks on the ﬁsh became
pronounced. By adjusting the brightness and contrast for each image appropriately (Fig. 1c), we could then
binary threshold the images to reveal the pixels in each image where the injuries had occurred (Fig. 1d). Note
that because the average intensity of each image diﬀered, we had to adjust the brightness and contrasts of
each image manually. We imported the binary converted images into MATLAB (2012b). Each image was
represented by a matrix where cells equal to zero (black pixels) were injured parts of the school, and cells
equal to 255 (white pixels) were uninjured parts of the school. By counting the number of values in the matrix
equal to zero, and then by dividing this total by the area of the school calculated by the polygon in ImageJ,
we determined the proportion of pixels in the school depicting injuries. We determined the mean proportion
of injuries of a school if that school had been measured in diﬀerent images (see Table A1).

Group Hunting Model – Important Quantities
The following quantities, which depend on the group size N and hunting time T, are required to calculate the
expected number of caught prey at time T (see Eq. 1): The average waiting time between two attacks for an
individual predator:

τa + τr

for N τa ≤ (τa + τr)
for N τa > (τa + τr) ,

Group Hunt Simulations
In order to test our theoretical predictions, we performed numerical simulations of a simple individual-based
model. N hunters perform subsequent attacks on a school of S(t) sardines, with the initial school size being
S(t = 0) = S0. The attack sequence of each hunter has a ﬁxed duration τa. The attack may lead to a
successful capture of a single prey with probability pc(na), which is a function of the number of all previous
attacks on the school according to Eq. A2 in the Appendix. A simulation run is terminated when all prey are
captured S(t) = 0. The preparation time for the next attack for each hunter is τr. The initial attack order
is set randomly. As time progresses, the next attack is performed by the individual with the longest waiting
time. For a ﬁxed attack durations τa and preparation times τr, the initial attack order of the hunters remains
unchanged. All presented results were obtained by averaging 100 independent simulation runs. We conﬁrmed
that our results are robust with respect to random attacks and preparation times, which introduces additional
stochasticity and randomises the order of the hunters within a single run (see Appendix section 1.4 for details).

School size analysis

1 Empirical Observations
1.1
From the videos, we selected single frames of the sardine schools (n = 123 frames; 8 diﬀerent schools; see
Table S1 for number of images per school) to be analysed and exported them using VirtualDub (v 1.9.11).
We imported the images into ImageJ (v 1.36b) and measured the lengths of ﬁve haphazardly selected ﬁsh
in each image (in pixels) using ImageJ’s internal measure function. We marked a polygon around the edge
of the school’s members and calculated the internal area of this polygon, again using the measure function.
Dividing the area of this polygon (in pixels) by the average length of the ﬁve selected ﬁsh gave us a proxy for
the relative size of each school (Fig. A1a). Sardine length is generally uniform across these schools [29].

1.2 Approach frequency
We recorded the time between consecutive approaches by diﬀerent sailﬁsh towards the sardine schools (n =
7 schools) (Fig. A1b). The time of approach was determined as the time when a sailﬁsh was within one
sailﬁsh body length of the sardine school with its dorsal ﬁn raised. This behaviour is typically observed before
an imminent attack [29,30]. We also recorded the time at which this sailﬁsh departed the school, which was
deﬁned as when the sailﬁsh swam away from the school with its dorsal ﬁn lowered. The time between the
approach and the departure was measured as the ‘attack length’. We also determined the time between one
sailﬁsh departing and another sailﬁsh approaching. On 19% of occasions, one sailﬁsh approached the school
before another sailﬁsh had departed it. In these cases, one or both sailﬁsh always abandoned their attack.

Injuries on individual ﬁsh

1.3
We investigated the extent to which individual sardines were injured. We sampled images from the videos
where unobstructed individual injured ﬁsh could be seen. In each image, we selected 1- 2 individuals that were
visibly the most injured (n = 45). We only selected a ﬁsh if another ﬁsh obstructed less than ∼ 10% of its
body surface. Like in the shoal injury analysis, but now based only on single individuals, we drew a polygon

around the outline of the focal ﬁsh, calculated the area of the polygon and cleared all pixels from outside this
polygon (making their intensity = 255). We then adjusted the brightness and contrast of each image before
binary thresholding, and then imported these binary images into MATLAB. We then summed the number of
pixels indicating injures (values equal to zero) and divided this total by the area of the polygon measured in
ImageJ to determine the proportion of the body of a sardine that was injured.

1.4 Group size eﬀects
Whilst we concentrated on how the sailﬁsh progressively injured prey over time, and how capture rates were
correlated with the level of injury in the prey school, there was also a weaker correlation between capture rates
and school size (Spearman Correlation; ρ = -0.54, P = 0.24, n = 7). If indeed capture rates do increase as
school size decreases (and we could not detect this eﬀect due to limited sample size), then our model could
be more broadly applied to other systems. The confusion eﬀect decreases as group size decreases, sometimes
making it easier to catch prey in smaller group sizes [43,44]. If individual hunters progressively decrease the
size of the prey group over time, then this could allow hunters in the future to increase capture rates in
subsequent attacks. Hence this model may not only apply when prey are injured or fatigued, but also when
prey group size decreases over time.

Injury in the school

1.5
There was a negative trend between injury level and school size (Spearman Correlation; ρ = -0.69, P = 0.07,
n = 8). Whilst again, the non-signiﬁcant trend could be due to limited sample size, it may also be due to the
dynamics of the hunt. Sailﬁsh break oﬀ smaller schools from larger schools numbering into the hundreds of
thousands of ﬁsh. If a small school was isolated relatively recently, it could in theory have a very low injury level
compared to a larger group that had been under attack for a long time. Presumably our observed schools had
variable initial sizes and attack durations that could introduce confounding variation into the levels of injury.
We also note that our measure of the proportion of the school that was injured combines both the severity
of injuries on individual ﬁsh, and the spread of injuries across diﬀerent ﬁsh. Both the severity of injuries and
spread of injuries across individuals are likely to be important in this system. We sometimes observed very
injured sardines breaking oﬀ from the school, and these individuals were quickly consumed by the sailﬁsh.
Hence the level of injuries on individual ﬁsh are likely to be important for improving capture success rates as
well as the general injury level of the school.

2 Modelling Group Hunting
2.1 Mathematical model - capture probability pc
We assume that the capture probability pc is a monotonically increasing function of the global injury level I,
and is bounded by pmin, pmax: 0 ≤ pmin ≤ pc(I) ≤ pmax ≤ 1. There are inﬁnitely many functions that
fulﬁl these requirements, and based on our empirical observations, we have no a priori arguments to choose
a particular one. However, the qualitative results will be independent on the particular choice of pc(I). Here
we choose

pc(I) = pmin + (pmax − pmin)(1 − e−aI I)

(A1)
which increases linearly with I for small injury levels and approaches pmax asymptotically for I → ∞ (see Fig.
2a, main text). This function naturally fulﬁls the monotonic increase in injury level with a necessary saturation
level. Furthermore, if not otherwise stated, we will use pmin = 0 and pmax = 1 as default parameters. We
have checked that this simpliﬁcation does not aﬀect the qualitative results. Note that we cannot measure the

global injury level I directly, and the fraction of prey school covered by injuries is only a visual proxy for I.
Therefore it is advantageous to express pc as a function of total number of attacks on the prey na.

The increment in the injury level ∆I per attack may in principle be an arbitrary function of the global
injury itself: ∆I = g(I). This in general implies a non-linear dependence of I on the number of attacks
na: I(na) = f(na). However, if we assume that the increment in the level of injury per attack is constant
∆I = const., then I is simply proportional to na (I ∝ na). In this case we can set, without loss of generality,
∆I = 1, rescale aI to a new constant a, and replace I by na. The probability can then be directly expressed
as a function of the number of attacks na as:

(A2)
We have explored how the rate of increase of the capture probability, a, and pmin aﬀects whether group
hunting is beneﬁcial for individuals in groups (Fig. A6).

pc(na) = pmin + (pmax − pmin)(1 − e−ana) .

Stochastic model with random attack and preparation times

2.2
In the main text we assume ﬁxed, constant attack and preparation times. This yields perfect turn-taking
of individuals with the order of attacking individuals set by the initial condition, which are randomized for
each hunt. However, a perfect turn-taking behavior may be questioned from the biological point of view.
Furthermore, in general, deterministic temporal sequences may lead to pathological behavior of mathematical
models for certain parameter combinations (“resonances”). In order to conﬁrm that our results are robust and
independent on the turn-taking behavior, we extended the simple model discussed in the main text, to random
attack and preparation durations:
Instead of ﬁxed duration, we model the attack and preparation times as
random variables ta and tr drawn from an exponential distribution with averages τa and τr, respectively. The
initial order of attacking hunters is again random as in the main text, but now the order of the hunters within
a single run does not persist but changes randomly due to the stochasticity of the attack and preparation
durations. Figure A7 shows the comparison between the simulation results for the (scaled) number of prey
captured for this modiﬁed model with our theoretical predictions (compare to main text, Fig. 2b and Fig. A5).
All simulation results were obtained by averaging over 100 independent simulations.
In particular for longer
hunts (T large), only the average waiting times are relevant and the results of the fully stochastic model
strongly match our theoretical predictions. For short times T, the additional stochasticity of the hunting
process leads to smoothening of the maximum number of prey captured, but the position of the maximum
and the maximal group size beneﬁcial for hunting remain essentially unchanged.

Energy Balance Equation

2.3
As the detailed metabolic costs of swimming and attacking in sailﬁsh are not documented, we considered a
simple, yet generic model, where diﬀerent energetic costs and beneﬁts are summarized in a few key parameters.
We assume that each hunter has a base rate of energy expenditure C0, which includes all metabolic costs of
swimming required to stay with the prey school, but excludes any additional energetic investment required to
perform an actual attack sequence. For simplicity, we assume that attacks and captures are instantaneous
events, which happen at discrete points in time ta and tc. This is a reasonable approximation as in general the
average attack time τa will be much shorter than the total hunt time Th. Prey capture is only possible during
an attack, thus capture points tc are always a subset of the attack points ta. The additional costs of attack
are included into the model as a constant energy decrement due to an increased energy consumption rate
during an attack ∆Ea = Caτa. The energy beneﬁt from each captured prey is given by a constant increment
∆Ec. Thus the total energy Ei for an individual hunter i during a hunt evolves according to the following

15

balance equation:

dEi(t)

(A3)
(A4)
with δ(t − t0) being the Dirac delta function. Without loss of generality, we rescale all terms by the energy
increment due to prey capture ∆Ec, thus we measure the energy in units of the average energy content of a
single prey item. The rescaled equation reads:

= −C0 − ∆Eaδ(t − ta) + ∆Ecδ(t − tc)
= −C0 − Caτaδ(t − ta) + ∆Ecδ(t − tc)

= −c0 − caτaδ(t − ta) + δ(t − tc)

with ei = Ei/∆Ec, cx = Cx/∆Ec.

By integrating over the entire time of the hunt Th, we obtain the overall energy payoﬀ per individual as:

Here the dimensionless number δc = ca/c0 represents the eﬀective increase of the energy consumption during
an attack relative to the base consumption rate. A value of δc = 1, would correspond to doubling of the
energy consumption rate during an attack sequence. We discuss only biologically relevant parameter values
c0 and δc, where the average energy pay-oﬀs are positive h∆etotali > 0. All other model parameters are the
same as in the main text.
Because the routine metabolic rate of adult sailﬁsh in unknown, we estimated a conservative value of c0
based on the routine metabolic rate (RMR) of Blue-ﬁn tuna (Thunnus orientalis). The RMR of a 8.1 kg tuna
is ∼ 280 mg O2 kg−1 h−1 at 25 oC [45]. The length:weight relationship of adult sailﬁsh is given by: Log W =
96 −5.443L3.007 where W is the mass and L is the length of a sailﬁsh [46]. A sailﬁsh 240 cm in length, therefore,
has a mass of 51.8 kg. We can scale the RMR of tuna according to the mass of the sailﬁsh by the following
scaling factor: RM Rsailf ish = RM Rtuna(8.1/51.8)(1−0.8) [47,48]. This gives a RMR for a sailﬁsh as 193.2
mg O2 kg−1 h−1. This equates to a sailﬁsh requiring 240 g O2 per day. Given the oxycaloriﬁc coeﬃcient is
13.59 [49], this equates to a sailﬁsh requiring 3263 kJ of energy per day to maintain RMR. Domenici et al.
(2014) found that the average length of sardines found in a sailﬁsh’s stomach was 19 cm [29]. This gives a
mass of 57 g per sardine, based on their length:weight relationship [50]. The energy content of similar species
(Sardinops melanostictus and Clupea harengus pallasi) is ∼ 6 - 9.6 kJ g−1 [51, 52]. An individual sardine,
therefore, may provide 342 - 547 kJ of energy to a sailﬁsh. Combining this information together, we estimate
that a sailﬁsh would require between 6 - 9.5 sardines per day to maintain RMR. This equates to ∼ 0.25 -
0.4 sardines per hour. Here we choose a value of c0 = 0.0001, meaning that a sailﬁsh would need to eat 1
sardine every 10000 seconds (2.8 hours, or 0.35 sardines per hour) to balance energy intake and expenditure.
We note that with decreasing values of c0, the free riding strategy becomes increasingly unlikely.

Another key question is; what is the realistic range of values for δc? Our earlier observations indicate
that the speed of approach towards the prey school during an attack sequence is similar to the continuous
swimming of non-attacking individuals [29, 30]. However, sailﬁsh sometimes initiate rapid swimming bursts
when the school attempts to escape into the depths or when chasing single prey that have left the school.
Thus signiﬁcant additional energetic costs of an attack sequence can only originate from these burst swims, the
slashing motion of the bill, turning, and prey handling, which are likely to only take-up only a small fraction of
the entire attack sequence. Even in the case for extremely high costs of slashing/capture, the relative increase
in costs of an attack are most likely of the order of the base rate energy consumption (δc ∼ 1 − 10). We
therefore conclude that the free riding strategy is very unlikely to yield any signiﬁcant beneﬁts to individuals.

Free riding during interrupted hunts

2.4
We also take into account the possibility of the hunt being interrupted due to external inﬂuences, for example,
the arrival of other predators (e.g. dolphins). This is modelled by a constant probability pint of the hunt being
terminated. For pint = 0, no interruption takes place and the hunt continues until all prey are captured. For
ﬁnite pint > 0 the hunt is interrupted randomly, and times available for hunting are exponentially distributed
with the average time Th = 1/pint.

The qualitative ﬁndings do not depend on this model extension, and a signiﬁcant energetic advantage of
free riding can be observed only for very large δc values (Fig. A8). Interestingly, in these extreme cases with
the ﬁnite probability of interruption of the hunt the free rider advantage becomes more pronounced. This can
be understood from the high energetic costs and negligible payoﬀs for producers in cases where the hunt was
interrupted at an early stage.

2.5 Why capture rates are likely to be important for group hunting sailﬁsh
We identiﬁed that increased capture rates per unit time was a key beneﬁt for individual hunters in groups.
But why might these rates be important to increase, and why might hunting time be restricted? On two
occasions we observed Spotted dolphins, (Stenella attenuata), arriving at the sardine school that were under
attack by sailﬁsh. On arrival at the sardine school, the dolphins used their tails to stun and disperse the
whole school. Sailﬁsh that have potentially invested hours into injuring and exhausting their prey can thus
lose their ﬁsh to the kleptoparasitic dolphins in a few seconds. The number of daylight hours is also likely to
put an upper limit on available hunting time. Studies on tagged sailﬁsh show that their time spent near the
surface increases during the day (compared to the night) [53], which suggests that hunting primarily takes
place at the surface during daytime periods. Hunting time is also likely to be constrained because once the
targeted school has been consumed, the sailﬁsh have to ﬁnd another larger school, separate oﬀ a smaller
school, and begin hunting again. Reducing the time between these events is presumably important in a time
limited system. Further, because individual prey items are not shared, prey caught per unit time may be a
particularly important measure of success during these hunts.

2.6 Model Parameter Choice
Our ﬁeld data provides enough information to formulate some global constraints for reasonable parameters
choices based on the observed group sizes and the observed time scales, which we discuss in detail below.
Please note that we have explored the model behaviour with diﬀerent parameters, and whereas quantitative
results might diﬀer, the overall results also in terms of their numerical values appear surprisingly robust and
the qualitative predictions remain unchanged.
Number of hunters N The observed sizes of the hunting sailﬁsh groups were N = 6 − 40. However, group
sizes exceeding 50 individuals have been reported previously. Therefore in our model we studied the
range from solitary hunter N = 1 up to a group size N = 100.

Initial number of prey S0 We have no quantitative measurement on the number of prey in the small school,
right after being split oﬀ from a large school. The observed prey schools were estimated to consist of
25 − 150 sardines at the time of recording. However, we have no information about the duration of the
hunt before the recording. Therefore, we use in our model calculations an initial number of sardines
larger, but in the same order of magnitude, as the largest groups observed: S0 = 200. We have also
tested smaller (larger) initial group sizes. The main eﬀect is a shift of hunting times, where large groups
outperform solitary hunters to shorter (longer) times T.

Minimal capture probability pmin It is impossible to obtain a reliable value for the initial probability to
catch a prey during a full attack sequence (approach to departure), but it appears to be very small. For

simplicity we set pmin = 0. We have also explored diﬀerent pmin values (see left panel Fig. A6). The
main observation is a decrease of the maximal beneﬁcial hunter group size with increasing pmin.

Catching probability growth rate a It is impossible to estimate its value from the available data. However
the choice of a will strongly aﬀect the overall time of the hunt before all prey individuals are captured
and the average capture eﬃciency during the hunt (no. prey captured / no. attacks). Large values of
a yield high average capture eﬃciencies already after a 1h of hunting (pc > 0.3) and as a consequence
very short hunts (< 1h) for reasonable prey school sizes. On the other hand extremely low values lead
to very low initial capture eﬃciencies (pc (cid:28) 0.1) and eventually result in very long hunting times > 4h
(see Fig. A4). In combination with other parameters used, a choice of a = 5 · 10−4 yields total hunting
times which appear consistent with our observations: T ∼ 2h for predator groups > 5.

Average attack sequence time τa It accounts for the entire time window where an individual sailﬁsh “mo-
nopolises” the prey school by performing its approach manoeuvre and attack. Here, we set it to the
median attack time observed for hunting sailﬁsh τa = 2.6s

Average preparation time τr It describes the average time required by an individual hunter to prepare for
the next attack sequence, i.e. assuming a suitable position at the rear of the prey school. This time is
not available from our observations, as it requires repeated observations of a solitary sailﬁsh hunting a
sardine school. However, a reasonable time scale can be estimated from qualitative observations of the
hunting process and other time scales, as well as from the assumed cooperative beneﬁts of the hunt.
Here we assume that τr is larger than τa. However, it is reasonable to assume that it is signiﬁcantly
shorter than 1min. Therefore, we use as a default parameter τr = 20s.
