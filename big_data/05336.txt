RICCI FLOW ON ASYMPTOTICALLY EUCLIDEAN MANIFOLDS

Abstract. In this paper, we prove that if an asymptotically Euclidean manifold
(M n, g) under the condition that R ≥ 0 has long time existence of Ricci ﬂow,
the mass of (M n, g) is nonnegative. In addition, we give an independent proof of
positive mass theorem in dimension 3.

A smooth orientable Riemannian manifold (M n, g) (n ≥ 3) is called an Asymp-
totically Euclidean (AE) manifold if for some compact K ⊂ M n, M n\K consists of
a ﬁnite number of components E1, . . . , Ek such that for each Ei there exists a C∞
diﬀeomorphism Φi : Ei → Rn\B(0, Ri) such that under this identiﬁcation,
(1.1)
for any partial derivative of order k as r → ∞, where r is the Euclidean distance
function. We call the positive number σi the order of end Ei.
The ADM-mass [4] from general relativity of an AE manifold (M, g) is deﬁned as

gij = δij + O(r−σi),

∂|k|gij = O(r−σi−k)

m(g) = lim

(∂igij − ∂jgii) dAj,

r→∞ZSr

where dAj = ∂j ydx.

The general positive mass conjecture is the following, see [24, Theorem 10.1].

Conjecture 1.1 (Positive Mass Conjecture). Let (M n, g) be an AE manifold of di-
mension n ≥ 3 with the order σ > (n − 2)/2, and nonnegative integrable scalar
curvature. Then m(g) ≥ 0 with equality if and only if (M, g) = (Rn, gE).

Henceforth, we use gE to denote the Euclidean metric. With all those assumptions,

the ADM mass is ﬁnite and independent of AE coordinates, see [5].

The positive mass conjecture was ﬁrst proved by Schoen and Yau [37] in dimension
three using minimal surface and its stability inequality. In addition, Schoen and Yau
showed that their argument extended to dimensions less than eight by using a minimal
hypersurface argument which was inductive on dimension. However, it turns out that
minimal hypersurfaces may have singularities on a subset whose codimension is at
least seven. Meanwhile, Witten gave a proof in [40] of the positive mass conjecture
that worked in all dimensions, but only for spin manifolds. Moreover, in dimension
three, Huisken and Ilmanen [19] proved the positive mass conjecture by using the
technique of the inverse mean curvature. Recently, Hein and LeBrun gave a proof
of the positive mass conjecture for K¨ahler AE manifolds, see [21]. To the author’s
knowledge, there is no solution for the positive mass conjecture of general dimension.
A natural question is that can we prove the positive mass conjecture by using
other geometric ﬂows, at least in dimension three? Since Ricci ﬂow is one of the most
powerful geometric ﬂows by using which Perelman completely classiﬁed all compact
3-manifolds, see [31, 32, 33], it is interesting to know how Ricci ﬂow interacts with
AE manifolds and mass.

It was proved by Dai and Ma in [16] that Ricci ﬂow preserves ALE condition,
nonnegative integrable scalar curvature and mass. Moreover, Robert Haslhofer in
[35] constructed a mass-decreasing ﬂow which performs a conformal transformation
at each surgery time.

One of the main theorem of this paper shows that if we have long time existence
of Ricci ﬂow, the AE manifold will converge to the Euclidean space in the weighted
space. The fact that the limit manifold at inﬁnity is Euclidean space is motivated by
considering the steady soliton on ALE manifold, see Appendix. The convergence at
inﬁnity does not preserve the mass, but decrease it to zero.

We assume throughout this paper that the scalar curvature R is nonnegative and
integrable, the manfold has only one end E 1and the order of the end σ > (n − 2)/2.
Moreover, we ﬁx a positive smooth function r(x) on M such that r(x) = |x| when
x ∈ E.

Note that when σ > n − 2, ∂igij − ∂jgii = O(r−σ−1) and hence

|m(g)| ≤ C lim
r→∞

rn−2−σ = 0

Therefore, we can also assume that the order σ ≤ n − 2.
Theorem 1.2. Let (M n, g) be an AE manifold with above assumptions. If there exists
a solution g(t) (0 ≤ t < ∞) of the Ricci ﬂow with g(0) = g, then the mass m(g) ≥ 0
with the equality if and only if (M n, g) = (Rn, gE).

1In fact, all the arguments below apply to the multi-end case with slight modiﬁcations.

For the general Ricci ﬂow, it is possible that the metric will become singular at
some ﬁnite time. In the case of dimension three, we can continue Ricci ﬂow by surgery.
We prove that mass and other related conditions are preserved under Ricci ﬂow with
surgery. Moreover, if we choose surgery parameter function δ(t) small enough, there
are only ﬁnitely many surgeries. We prove the ﬁniteness of surgery times by carefully
examining the change of Perelman’s µ-functional over surgery times. Therefore, we
have the long time existence of Ricci ﬂow after the last surgery time and by using the
result of Theorem 1.2 we can prove positive mass theorem in dimension three.
Theorem 1.3. When n = 3, the mass m(g) ≥ 0 with the equality if and only if
(M 3, g) = (R3, gE).

For the remainder of the paper,the constant C in the estimates may vary line by

line.

2. Mass under Ricci flow

We prove in this section that Ricci ﬂow preserves AE condition and mass is pre-
served under Ricci ﬂow. Diﬀerent from the argument of Dai and Ma in [16], we ﬁx an
AE coordinate system along the ﬂow. The main tool we use is the following maximum
principle on noncompact manifold for Ricci ﬂow, see [11, Theorem 12.14].
Theorem 2.1. Suppose that g(t), t ∈ [0, T ], is a complete solution to the Ricci ﬂow
on a noncompact manifold M with |Rm(g(t))| ≤ k0 for some k0 > 0. Let

Lu = ut − ∆u − hX(t),∇ui − G(u, t),

where X(t) is a smooth family of bounded vector ﬁelds and the function G : R ×
[0, T ] → R is locally Lipschitz in the R factor and continuous in the [0, T ] factor.
Suppose that u is a smooth function such that

Lu ≤ 0 and |u(x, t)| ≤ exp(cid:0)bdg(t)(O, x) + 1(cid:1)

for some constant b. For any c ∈ R, let U(t) be the solution to the corresponding
ordinary diﬀerential equation:

dU
dt

=G(U, t),

U(0) =c.
If u(x, 0) ≤ c for all x ∈ M, then we have

u(x, t) ≤ U(t)

for all x ∈ M and t ∈ [0, T ] as long as the ODE exists.
Theorem 2.2. Let (M, g(t)), 0 ≤ t ≤ T be a Ricci ﬂow solution with bounded curva-
ture on M and (M, g(0)) is an AE manifold of order σ > 0, then

(1) AE condition is preserved with the same AE coordinates and order.
(2) If σ > (n − 2)/2 and R is integrable, the mass is unchanged.

gij = δij + O(r−σ),

Proof. (1): Since (M, g(0)) is an AE manifold, there exists an end E and C∞ diﬀeo-
morphism Φ : E → Rn\B(0, R) such that under this coordinates,
(2.1)
for any k = 1, 2,· · · .
From this condition, it is easy to conclude that |∇kRm(0)| = O(r−σ−k−2).
Since the Riemannian curvature is uniformly bounded on [0, T ], there exists an
S > 0 such that |Rm| ≤ S on M × [0, T ]. Now we consider the evolution equation of
|Rm|2 which satisﬁes

∂|k|gij = O(r−σ−k)

∂t|Rm|2 ≤ ∆|Rm|2 + 16|Rm|3 ≤ ∆|Rm|2 + 16S|Rm|2.

Let u = |Rm|2e−16St, then ∂tu ≤ ∆u on M × [0, T ].
Next we prove u has the same decaying condition as u(0), see also [16].
Let h(x) = r4+2σ on M. We set w = hu and it satisﬁes

(∂t − ∆)w = Bw − 2∇ log h∇w

on M × [0, T ] where B = 2|∇h|2−h∆h
Then from above equation and maximum principle, we conclude |w| ≤ C and hence
|Rm| ≤ Cr−2−σ on M × [0, T ].
Claim:

|∇kRm| ≤ Cr−2−k−σ.

Proof of the claim: We assume that the claim holds for all 0 ≤ l < k. Let hk =
r4+2σ+2k and wk = hk|∇kRm|2, then from the evolution equation of |∇kRm|2

for 0 < l < k.
From (2.4) we have

(∂t − ∆)wk ≤ −2∇ log hk∇wk + C(wk + w1/2

From Theorem 2.1, we conclude that wk is uniformly bounded on M × [0, T ] since
the the solution of the following ODE

dφ

= C(φ + φ1/2),

(2.5)
is bounded on [0, T ]. Therefore |∇kRm| ≤ Cr−2−k−σ.

For any vector ﬁeld U on M, we have

Therefore

(2.7)

and in particular,

gii(t) = gii(0)(1 + O(r−2−σ)) = (1 + O(r−σ))(1 + O(r−2−σ))

(2.8)

= 1 + O(r−σ)

Now using the identity gij = 1

4(gi+j,i+j − gi−j,i−j) and (2.7), we conclude that

gij(t) = O(r−σ) when i 6= j.
Now from the evolution equation of the Christoﬀel symbol
ij = −gkl(∇iRjl + ∇jRil − ∇lRij)

∂tΓk

ij = O(r−σ−3) and hence ∂iRjk = O(r−σ−3) from the

and (2.2), we conclude that Γk
relation ∇iRjk = ∂iRjk − Γl
One can argue like above that ∂igjk(t) = O(r−σ−1) since ∂t(∂igjk) = −2∂iRjk. Now
by induction we can show for all k, ∂|k|gij = O(r−σ−k) therefore we have shown that
(E, gij(t)) is an AE coordinate system with the same order σ.

Now from [26, Lemma 11], we have

r→∞ZSr |∇R(t)| dS = 0

for t > 0, so m′(g(t)) = 0 for t > 0.

On the other hand, it is easy to show m(g(t)) is continuous at 0, see [26, Corollary
(cid:3)

12], hence the mass is unchanged.
Remark 2.3. The proof of Theorem 2.2 actually shows that if gij(0)− δij ∈ C k
gij(t) − δij ∈ C k−2
in [16] we can prove if gij(0) − δij ∈ C 2

We know from the evolution equation of the scalar curvature R : ∂tR = ∆R +
2|Rc|2 ≥ ∆R and the strong maximum principle, either R(t) ≡ 0 for all t ≥ 0 so that
g(0) is Ricci-ﬂat and hence Euclidean by comparison geometry, or R(t) > 0 for all
t > 0. Since mass in unchanged under Ricci ﬂow, by a time translation if necessary,
we can assume R(0) > 0 at the beginning.

3. Perelman’s µ-functional

(3.1)

(3.2)

Recall that Perelman’s W entropy [31] is deﬁned as

W(g, f, τ ) =Z (cid:0)τ (|∇f|2 + R) + f − n)(cid:1)

for smooth function f and τ > 0. Let u = e−f /2, (3.1) becomes

e−f

(4πτ )n/2 dV

W(g, u, τ ) =Z (cid:0)τ (4|∇u|2 + Ru2) − u2 log u2 − nu2(cid:1) (4πτ )−n/2 dV

Moreover, For a general (possibly incomplete) Riemannian manifold (M, g), µ func-
tional is deﬁned as

0 (M) andZM

(3.3)

µ(g, τ ) = inf{W(g, u, τ ) | u ∈ W 1,2

u2(4πτ )−n/2 dV = 1}.

Note that when M is complete, W 1,2(M) = W 1,2

0 (M). Moreover, from the deﬁnition

we have µU (g, τ ) ≥ µM (g, τ ) for any open set U ⊂ M.
compact manifold as compact case,

We have the following monotonicity result under Ricci ﬂow for the complete non-

µ(g(t2), τ (t2)) ≥ µ(g(t1), τ (t1))

for all 0 ≤ t1 ≤ t2 < ¯τ where τ (t) = ¯τ − t, 0 < ¯τ < T and Ricci ﬂow exists for [0, T ].
The proof of the monotonicity formula is similar to the compact manifold case. We
can do integration by parts by analyzing the heat kernel and the solution of conjugate
heat equation, see for example [14].

It was proved in [38], that µ(g, τ ) is ﬁnite if g has bounded geometry, that is, the
curvature is bounded and the injective radius is positive. In particular, for any AE
manifold the µ functional is ﬁnite.

RICCI FLOW ON ASYMPTOTICALLY EUCLIDEAN MANIFOLDS

7

It was proved in [42] that for a manifold with bounded geometry, W(g, u, 1) has a
smooth positive minimizer if µ(g, 1) is less than the corresponding value at inﬁnity.
To be precise, if for any sequence pn → ∞ on the manifold M such that (M, g, pn)
converges smoothly in the Cheeger-Gromov sense to (M∞, g∞, p∞) and µM (g, 1) <
µM∞(g∞, 1), then µM (g, 1) has a smooth positive minimizer.

In the case of Euclidean space, we have the following type of logarithmic Sobolev
inequality, which appears in the work by Weissler [17] and is equivalent to the Gross
logarithmic inequality [18].

Theorem 3.1. For any function w ∈ W 1,2(Rn) andR w2 dx = 1, we have

Z w2 log w2 dx ≤

n
2

log(cid:18) 2

πneZ |∇w|2 dx(cid:19) .

(3.4)

Equality holds if and only if w2 = (4πτ )−n/2e− |x−p|2

4τ

for some p ∈ Rn and τ > 0.

4τ

It is immediate from (3.4) that W(gE, u, τ ) ≥ 0 where equality holds if and only
if u2 = e− |x−p|2
for some p ∈ Rn. Therefore, µRn(gE, 1) = 0. For an AE manifold
M n, we have (M, g, pn) C∞
−→ (Rn, gE, p∞) for any sequence pn → ∞ by Cheeger-
Gromov compactness theorem. Therefore W(g, u, τ ) has a smooth positive minimizer
if µ(g, τ ) = µ(τ−1g, 1) < 0 from the above result. Note that τ−1g is still an AE
metric.

We have the following lemma.

Lemma 3.2. Assume that (Mi, gi) converges to (M∞, g∞) smoothly in the Cheeger-
Gromov sense and µ(g∞, τ ) is ﬁnite, then

µ(gi, τ ).

µ(g∞, τ ) ≥ lim sup
i→∞
0 (M∞) such that W(g∞, u, τ ) ≤ µ(g∞, τ )+
0 (Mi) which are the pull-back functions of u and

Proof. For any ǫ > 0, we can ﬁnd a u ∈ W 1,2
ǫ. For large i, we can ﬁnd ui ∈ W 1,2
limi→∞ W(gi, ui, τ ) = W(g∞, u, τ ) by the convergence.
Therefore we have

lim sup

i→∞

µ(gi, τ ) ≤ lim

i→∞W(gi, ui, τ ) ≤ µ(g∞, τ ) + ǫ.

Since the above holds for any ǫ > 0, we have lim supi→∞ µ(gi, τ ) ≤ µ(g∞, τ ).

(cid:3)

It follows immediately from the above lemma that µ(g, τ ) ≤ 0 for any AE manifold

since (M, g, pn) C∞

−→ (Rn, gE, p∞) for any pn → ∞.

The Euler-Lagrange equation for the minimizer of µ(g, τ ) is
τ (−4∆u + Ru) − u log u2 − nu = µ(g, τ )u.

(3.5)

For the general Ricci ﬂow on the noncompact manifold we have the following result

and the proof is almost identical with the compact case, see [31, Section 3.1],

8

YU LI

Theorem 3.3. If (M n, g) is a manifold with bounded geometry such that a solution
g(t) of bounded curvature to the Ricci ﬂow with g(0) = g exists for t ∈ [0, T ), then
for any ¯τ ∈ (0, T ), µ(g, ¯τ) < 0 unless (M n, g) is isometric to (Rn, gE).
Proof. Let τ (t) = ¯τ − t and y ∈ M and consider the corresponding fundamental
solution

(3.6)

v(x, t) = (4πτ (t))−n/2e−f (x,t),

t ∈ [0, ¯τ )

to the adjoint heat equation

∂v
∂t

= −∆g(t)v + Rg(t)v

with limtր¯τ v(·, t) = δy.
The existence of the fundamental solutions to the adjoint heat equation on non-
compact manifold can be found in [11]. The basic properties of the fundamental
solutions are proved in [14].

Then by the monotonicity of the entropy,

(3.7)

µ(g, ¯τ) = µ(g, τ (0)) ≤ W(g(0), f (0), τ (0)) ≤ lim

tր¯τ W(g(t), f (t), τ (t)) = 0.

where the proof of the last limit in (3.7) can be found in [14, Theorem 7.1].
If
µ(g, ¯τ) = 0, W(g(t), f (t), τ (t)) = 0 since it is monotone. Therefore from the formula
(3.8)

dW(g(t), f (t), τ (t))

we have

So we have ¯f (s(t)) = ¯f (O) + th∇ ¯f ,∇dit=0 + t2. In other words, ¯f is quadratically
increasing and therefore has a minimal point O1. Then we have ¯f (x) = ¯f (O1) +
d2(x, O1). In particular, by taking trace of (3.10) we have

∆d2 = 2n.

Therefore (M n, g) is isometric to (Rn, gE) by the comparison theorem since g is Ricci-
ﬂat.
(cid:3)

Now we have the following crucial result.

Theorem 3.4. If (M n, g) is an AE manifold such that the scalar curvature R > 0,
then limτ→∞ µ(g, τ ) = 0.
Proof. If the conclusion does not hold, we can ﬁnd a sequence (τk)k∈N going to ∞ and
limk→∞ µ(g, τk) = µ∞, so that either µ∞ is a ﬁnite negative number or µ∞ = −∞.

By the above assumption, µ(g, τk) has a minimizer uk and it satisﬁes

The metric ˜g on E, after a diﬀeomorphism, is nothing but τ−1

k g. So by the AE
condition, (E, ˜g) converges in the Cheeger-Gromov sense to (Rn\{0}, gE) and the
convergence is smooth away from the origin.

So (3.12) becomes

(3.32)

All ˜uk can be regarded as functions deﬁned on Rn except for a ball with center 0.

We next prove that there is a limit in W 1,2(Rn) for the sequence {˜uk}.

Therefore, for any annulus Ca,A = {x ∈ Rn | a < |x| < A}, we have a uniform

In other words, ˜uk are bounded in W 1,2(Ca,A) and hence a subsequnce of {˜uk} con-
verges weakly to a function u∞ in W 1,2(Ca,A) and by Sobolev immbedding converges
strongly to u∞ in Lp(Ca,A) if 1 ≤ p < 2n/n − 2. Choosing two sequences am → 0 and
Am → ∞ for m = 1, 2, . . ., by the diagonal argument replacing {˜uk} by a subsequence
if necessary, we have a function u∞ deﬁned on Rn\0 such that for every compact set
C in Rn\0, there is an N > 0 such that {˜uk, k ≥ N} converges weakly to u∞ in
W 1,2(Rn\0) and strongly in Lp(Rn\0) if 1 ≤ p < 2n/n − 2.

Remark 3.8. We can get a uniform constant for Lemma 3.5 since the Sobolev constant
only depends on the bounds of curvature and injective radius. The volume control of
K′i is used to prove (3.31).

Next, we use Theorem 3.4 to prove the no local collapsing theorem in the case of
AE manifold. Recall that a Riemannian manifold is κ-noncollapsed on all scales if
for any metric ball B(x, r) satisfying |Rm| ≤ r−2 for all y ∈ B(x, r), we have

VolB(x, r)

rn

≥ κ.

Following the celebrated work of Perelman, we have

Theorem 3.9. Let g(t), t ∈ [0,∞), be the Ricci ﬂow solution on an AE manifold
M n with R > 0, then there exists κ > 0 such that g(t) is κ-noncollapsed on all scales.

Proof. Since Ricci ﬂow preserves the AE condition. So there exists a κ1 > 0 such that
for any t ∈ [0, 1], r > 0, we have

(3.44)

VolBg(t)(x, r)

rn

≥ κ1,

where Bg(t)(x, r) is a metric ball in (M n, g(t)).

For t ∈ [1,∞), r > 0 and p ∈ M such that |Rm| ≤ r−2 in Bg(t)(x, r) we have the

following inequality whose proof can be found in [12, Proposition 5.37]

(3.45)

µ(g(t), r2) ≤ log

VolBg(t)(x, r)

rn

+ C(n).

Then by (3.45), Theorem 3.4 and the continuity and monotonicity of µ(g, τ ), there

exists a constant C such that

C ≤ µ(g(0), r2 + t) ≤ µ(g(t), r2) ≤ log
We conclude that there exists κ2 > 0 such that

V olBg(t)(x, r)

rn

+ C(n).

(3.46)

V olBg(t)(x, r)

rn

≥ κ2.

Combining (3.44) and (3.46), we can ﬁnd κ = min(κ1, κ2) > 0 such that g(t) is
(cid:3)

κ-noncollapsed on all scales.

4. Analysis of singularity at time infinity

at inﬁnity classiﬁed by Hamilton, see [20].

For the Ricci ﬂow (M, g(t)), t ∈ [0,∞), there are two diﬀerent types of singularity
Case 1 (Type IIb): supM×[0,∞)t|Rm| = ∞.
In this case, we take any sequences of times Ti → ∞ and then choose (xi, ti) ∈

M n × [0, Ti] such that

ti(Ti − ti)|Rm|(xi, ti) = sup

t(Ti − t)|Rm|(x, t).

M n×(0,Ti]

If we set Qi = |Rm|(xi, ti), it can be proved that gi(t) = Qig(ti + Q−1
i t) converges
smoothly in the Cheeger-Gromov sense to a complete eternal Ricci ﬂow solution
(M∞, g∞(t), x∞), t ∈ (−∞, +∞).

Then for any τ > 0,

+ ti) = 0

(4.1)

where the ﬁrst inequality follows from Lemma 3.2, the last from the monotonicity of
µ and the equality is from Theorem 3.4.

From Theorem 3.3, it must be the case that M n is isometric to Rn. But this is

impossible since |Rm|g∞(0)(x∞) = limi→∞ |Rm|gi(0)(xi) = 1.

Case 2 (Type III): supM×[0,∞)t|Rm| < ∞.
In this case, suppose (xi, ti) is a sequence of points and times with ti → ∞ and

ti|Rm|(xi, ti) = ti sup

x∈M|Rm|(x, ti) ≥ c

for some c > 0. Then like the ﬁrst case gi(t) = Qig(ti + Q−1
t), t ∈ [−tiQi,∞),
converges to (M∞, g∞(t), x∞), t ∈ (−c, +∞), which again we derive a contradiction.

Therefore, we have proved that the singularity at inﬁnity is of type III, and

(4.2)

lim
t→∞

M |Rm(t)| = 0.

We choose an ǫ ∈ (0, 1) to be determined later. From (4.2) we can assume for t

large enough we have

(4.3)

sup
M |Rm| ≤

ǫ

1 + t

.

So by a translation of time, we can assume (4.3) holds for any t ≥ 0.
Next, we prove a gradient estimate and Harnack inequality for the solution of heat
equation under the condition of (4.3). The proof is a long time version of the Li-Yau
estimates, see [25].

Set u0 = r−2−σ and we consider the positive solution u of the heat equation

YU LI

ut = ∆u

with the initial condition u(0) = u0.

It can be proved by using the maximum principle as in the proof of Theorem 2.2,
that for any T > 0, t ∈ [0, T ], u(t) has the same decaying condition as u(0). To be
precise, there exist c1(T ) > 0 and c2(T ) > 0 such that

(4.5)

c1(T )r−2−σ ≤ u(t) ≤ c2(T )r−2−σ.

Let f = log u. The f satisies

We now prove the following lemma

ft = ∆f + |∇f|2.

On the other hand, we know that from Bochner’s formula
∂t|∇u|2 − ∆t|∇u|2 = −2|∇2u|2 ≤ 0

and |∇u|2(0) = O(r−6−2σ). Then |∇u|(t) = O(r−3−σ) for any t ≥ 0.
It is now immediate from (4.5) that |∇ log u|2 is bounded on M n × [0, T ]. Since
all conditions in Theorem 2.1 are satisﬁed, H is uniformly bounded on M n × [0, T ].
Then we have

Therefore, |Rm| ≤ Ct−1−σ0/2. In other words, we have shown δ0 can be chosen to be

u(x, t) ≤ Ct−1−σ0/2

We have the following version of Shi’s estimate, see also [36],

Theorem 4.7. For any k = 0, 1, . . .

|∇kRm| ≤ Ckt−1−δ0−k/2.

for 0 < l < k and

(t − s)k|∇lRm||∇k−lRm||∇kRm| = (t − s)k|Rm||∇kRm|2 ≤ Ct−1−δ0F

for l = 0 or l = k.

Therefore, we can ﬁnd nonnegative constants C1, C2, . . . , Ck, such that F satisﬁes

the following equation

(4.24)

We consider the ODE

∂tF ≤ ∆F + Ct−2−2δ0(F 1/2 + t1+δ0F ).

φ(s) = Cs−2−2δ0

such that F (s) ≤ φ(s) since F (s) = Ck|Rm|2 ≤ Cks−2−2δ0.

Since φ(t) is increasing, φ(t) ≥ Ct−2−2δ0 for t ≥ s and hence

dφ
dt ≤ Ct−1−δ0φ.
Then it is easy to show φ(t) ≤ Cs−2−2δ0 for t ≥ s.

Now from Theorem 2.1, we conclude that

since F (s) = Ck|Rm|2 ≤ Cks−2−2δ0.
In other words,

F (2s) ≤ Cs−2−2δ0

Since s is an arbitrary positive number, we have

sk|∇kRm|2(2s) ≤ Cks−2−2δ0.

which completes the induction process.

|∇kRm|(t) ≤ Ct−1−δ0−k/2

Thus there exist a metric g∞ such that g(t) converges to g∞ smoothly as t → ∞.

Moreover, argue as before

Then from Theorem 3.3 we can show (M n, g∞) = (Rn, gE). In particular, M n is

5. Proof of Theorem 1.2

In this section, we prove our ﬁrst main theorem.
We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of weighted function space, see for example [24]. Let
β (E) consists of

(M, g) be an AE manifold with the AE end E, the weighted space C k
C k functions u for which the norm

(min{r(x), r(y)})−β+k+α |∇ku(x) − ∇ku(y)|

Then we have the following convergence result in the weighted space.

Theorem 5.1. For any σ′ ∈(cid:0) n−2

2 , σ(cid:1), we have gij(t) converges to gij(∞) in C∞

t → ∞. In particular, (gij(∞), E) is an AE coordinate system on M n.
Proof. We ﬁrst prove a lemma

Lemma 5.2.

for some Ck, δk > 0 and all (x, t) ∈ M × [0,∞).

|∇kRm| ≤ Ckt−1−δk r−k−σ′

Proof of the lemma: We choose σ1, σ0 such that σ′ < σ1 < σ0 < σ.
We consider a domain Dk = {(x, t) ∈ M × [0,∞) | r(x) ≥ tak} in the spacetime

(5.1)

|∇kRm| ≤ Ckt−1−σ0/2−k/2 ≤ Ckt−1−δk r−σ′−k

For (x, t) ∈ Dk, we have the following estimate.
Claim: |∇kRm|2 ≤ Cr−4−2σ1−2k on Dk.
Proof of the claim: Let hk = r4+2σ1+2k and wk = hk|∇kRm|2, like before we have

for some δ′0 = min{2a0 − 1, δ0/2} > 0.

Moreover, on ∂D0 we have

(5.3)

|Rm| ≤ Ct−1−σ0/2 = Cr−(1+σ0/2)/a0 ≤ Cr−2−σ1

for a0 suﬃciently close to 1/2.

Therefore, the claim holds for k = 0 from maximum principle.
Now we assume that the claim holds for all 0 ≤ l < k, then by induction on Dk we

have

hk|∇lRm||∇k−lRm||∇kRm| = hk|Rm||∇kRm|2 ≤ t−1−δ0/2wk

for l = 0 or l = k and

hk|∇lRm||∇k−lRm||∇kRm| ≤ Crk|∇kRm| = Cr−σ1−2w1/2

k ≤ Ct−akσ1−2ak w1/2

k

for 0 < l < k.
Therefore from (5.2) we have

(∂t − ∆)wk ≤ −2∇ log hk∇wk + Ct−1−δ′

k (wk + w1/2
k )

for some δ′k > 0.

On the other hand, on ∂Dk we have by Shi’s estimate

(5.4)

|∇kRm| ≤ Ckt−k/2t−1−σ0/2 = Ckr−(1+k/2+σ0/2)/ak ≤ Ckr−2−k−σ1

when ak is chosen to be suﬃciently close to 1/2.

So from maximum principle, we conclude that wk is uniformly bounded on Dk and

the claim holds for k as well.
Therefore, on Dk we have

|∇kRm| ≤ Ckr−2−k−σ1 ≤ Ckt−1−δk r−k−σ′

for some δk > 0 and ak close to 1/2.

Thus the proof of lemma is complete.
With the same argument in Theorem 2.2, we conclude that gij(t) converges to
−σ′ because the term t−1−δk guarantees that |∇kRm| is integrable with
gij(∞) in C∞
respect to time at inﬁnity. In other words, gij(∞) is an AE coordinate system with
a smaller order σ′ for the Euclidean space.

(cid:3)

Now we continue to prove Theorem 1.2. We choose a smooth function η such that

η = 0 outside of the AE end E and η = 1 when r is large.

Let χ(t) = (∂igij(t) − ∂jgii(t))∂j be a vector ﬁeld on the AE end, by the deﬁnition

6. Ricci flow with surgery on AE manifold

In this section, we deﬁne the Ricci ﬂow with surgery on an AE manifold, most
deﬁnitions and notations are from [32] [27] [7] and [22] with slight modiﬁcations. We
assume from now on M is an orientable Riemannian AE 3-manifold with R > 0 unless
otherwise speciﬁed.

First of all we ﬁx a surgery model, see [32, Section 2] and [27, Chapter 12],

Deﬁnition 6.1. (surgery model) Consider Mstan = R3 with its natural SO(3)-action,
then there is a complete metric gstan on Mstan such that

(1) gstan is SO(3)-invariant.
(2) gstan has nonnegative sectional curvature.
(3) There is a compact ball B ⊂ Mstan so that the restriction of the metric gstan
to the complement of this ball is isometric to the product (S2, h) × (R+, ds2)
where h is the round metric of scalar curvature 1 on S2.
(4) There is a standard Ricci ﬂow (Mstan, gstan(t)), 0 ≤ t < 1 such that 1 is the

singular time.

For an AE manifold M 3, under Ricci ﬂow, we either have long time existence or the
metric goes singular at some ﬁnite time. In the latter case, we modify the resulting
limit by surgery, which cuts oﬀ high curvature parts and add standard capped tubes,
so as to produce a new manﬁold with an AE end which serves a new initial condition
for Ricci ﬂow. Now we clarify the process of surgery at the ﬁrst singular time for
example.

Let (M, g(t)), 0 ≤ t < T be the Ricci ﬂow solution where T is the ﬁrst singular

time. Let Ω ⊂ M be a subset deﬁned by

Then we have the following properties:

Ω = {x ∈ M| lim sup

Rg(x, t) < ∞}.

C∞-topology on every compact sets of Ω.

(1) As t → T the metric g(t)|Ω limit to g(T ) uniformly in the

(2) Every end of a connected component of Ω is contained in a strong ǫ-tube.
(3) There exists r > 0 such that any x ∈ Ω × {T} with R(x) ≥ r−2 has a strong
(4) There exists a compact set K ⊂ M such that |Rm| is bounded on K c × [0, T ).
(5) The scalar curvature R(g(T )) is a proper function from Ω → (0,∞).

(C, ǫ)-canonical neighborhood in cM = M × [0, T ) ∪Ω×[0,T ) (Ω × [0, T ]).

In particular, K c ⊂ Ω.

Proof. The proof of (1) − (3) can be found in [27, Theorem 11.9]. (4) is proved by
pseudolocality, see [14, Theorem 1.1]. To prove (5), we need the following lemma.

Lemma 6.3. There exists a compact set K such that g(T ) is an AE coordinate system
on K c = M − K.

Proof of the lemma: From [14, Theorem 1.1], there exist a compact set K and
S > 0 such that |Rm(x, t)| ≤ S on K c × [0, T ). Enlarge K if necessary, we can

30

YU LI

assume gij(0) is an AE coordinate system on K c and ∂K is smooth. Then we can use
the same argument in Theorem 2.2 on the parabolic cylinder K c × [0, T ) to conclude
that g(T ) is an AE coordinate system on K c.
Let (xn)n∈N be a sequence in Ω such that 0 < c ≤ R(xn, T ) ≤ C for some constants
0 < c < C. Since by the Lemma 6.3, g(T ) has r−2−σ decaying at inﬁnity, all xn
are contained in a compact set of M. Then we assume, by taking a subsequence if
necessary, xn converges to a point x∞ in M. If x∞ in not in Ω, by Lemma 7.2 in the
next section, we have R(xn, T ) goes to inﬁnity which is a contradiction.

Thus, the proof of Theorem 6.2 is complete.

(cid:3)

Remark 6.4. We call the end K c in Lemma 6.3 AE end of Ω.

We ﬁx 0 < ρ < r where r is the constant from Theorem 6.2(3) and deﬁne Ωρ ⊂ Ω
be the the closed subset of all x ∈ Ω for which R(x, T ) ≤ ρ−2. For a component Ω1
of Ω which contains no point of Ωρ, by the canonical neighborhood theorem, one of
the following holds, see [27, Lemma 11.28]:

(1) Ω1 is a strong double ǫ-horn and is dﬀeomorphic to S2 × R.
(2) Ω1 is a C-capped ǫ-horn and is diﬀeomorphic to R3.
(3) Ω1 is a compact component and is diﬀeomorphic to S3/Γ or S1 × S2.

Those are all possibilities as S1 ×Z2 S2 and punctured RP 3 are excluded since M is
orientable.
Let Ω0(ρ) be the union of all components of Ω containing points of Ωρ, then Ω0(ρ)
has ﬁnitely many components and is a union of the AE end and ﬁnitely many strong
ǫ-horns each of which is disjoint from Ωρ. The ﬁniteness of horns can be derived from
the properness of R(T ) → (0,∞) and the rest arguments can be found in [27, Lemma
11.30].
Next, we have the following lemma which asserts the existence of a strong δ-necks

on which we will do surgeries.
Lemma 6.5. [7, Theorem 5.1] For any δ > 0, there exist h ∈ (0, δρ) and a con-
stant D = D(δ, ρ) such that the following holds: Let x, y, z ∈ Ω such that R(x, t) ≤
ρ−2, R(y, t) = h−2 and R(z, t) ≥ Dh−2. Assume there is a curve γ connecting x to z
via y. Then (y, t) is center of a strong δ-neck.

Now for the surgery parameters r, δ < 1 we set ρ = rδ, then the scale h = h(ρ, r) =

h(δ, r) and D = D(ρ, r) = D(δ, r) are determined. Moreover, we require that

since the proof of lemma 6.5 argues by contradiction by choosing two independent
sequences hi → 0 and Di → +∞.

We say (M+, g+) is obtained from (Ω, g(T )) by (r, δ)-surgery at time T if
(1) M+ is obtained from Ω by removing components disjoint from Ωρ and cutting

along a locally ﬁnite collection of disjoint 2-spheres, capping oﬀ 3-balls.

(2) All x ∈ M+\M(T ) are contained in a surgery cap and the cutting and capping

are done on a strong δ-neck centered at a point y with R(t, T ) = h−2.

RICCI FLOW ON ASYMPTOTICALLY EUCLIDEAN MANIFOLDS

31

(3) (M+, g+) is pinched toward positive curvature.
Now we show (r, δ)-surgery must exist, see [7, Lemma 7.6].
By Zorn’s lemma, on Ω there exists a maximal collection {Ni} of pairwise disjoint
δ-necks centered at yi with R(yi, T ) = h−2. Then from lemma (6.5), every components
of Ω\ ∪i Ni has the scalar curvature either less than Dh−2 or greater than ρ−2. Then
we remove all the components of the second kind and do surgeries on those δ-necks
Ni.

Now we let M+ be the resulting manifold and R(g+) ∈ (0, Dh−2]. From the con-
struction we know that each component of M+ contains at least one point p at which
R(p, T ) ≤ ρ−2, hence there are at most ﬁnitely many components by the properness
of R. Moreover one of the component M 0
+ containing the AE end of M+ is an AE
manifold with the same order σ as M. In addition, the mass of (M 0
+, g(T )) is well
deﬁned and is equal to that of M, by the same argument in [16].

In general, we can construct by induction the weakly decreasing parameter func-
tions r, δ, κ : [0,∞) → (0,∞) to regulate the surgery process. The following existence
theorem is proved in [27, Theorem 15.9], see also [7, Theorem 1.2].

Theorem 6.6. There exists a Ricci ﬂow with surgery (M, gM) on [0,∞) with the
initial condition (M, g) and decreasing functions δ(t), r(t), κ(t) : [0,∞) → R+ such
that the following holds,

(1) (M, gM) has curvature pinched toward positive;
(2) the ﬂow satisﬁes the strong (C, ǫ)-canonical neighborhood theorem with param-

eter r(t) on [0,∞);

(3) the ﬂow is k(t)-noncollapsed on [0,∞) on scales ≤ ǫ and
(4) for any singular time t the surgery is performed with control δ(t) at scale

h(t) = h(ρ(t), δ(t)) = h(r(t)δ(t), δ(t)).

Next we show that surgery times do not accumulate.

Theorem 6.7. Let (M, G) be a Ricci ﬂow with surgery on [0,∞) with the initial con-
dition (M, g) with parameter functions δ(t), r(t), κ(t), we show that on each compact
interval I of [0,∞), we have at most ﬁnitely many surgeries.
Proof. Since all the parameter functions are decreasing, we can choose uniform pa-
rameters δ, r and κ on I. Therefore functions h and D are uniformly determined as
well. At each singular time t, by our construction R(x, t) ≤ Dh−2. Since curvature
is pinched toward positive curvature, we can assume |Rm| ≤ CDh−2. Now from the
evolution equation of |Rm|2

∂t|Rm|2 ≤ ∆|Rm|2 + 16|Rm|3

the regular Ricci ﬂow exists at least for time
uniformly chosen, there are at most ﬁnitely many surgeries performed on I.

(cid:3)

Remark 6.8. Theorem 6.7 holds for all Ricci ﬂows with surgery with normalized initial
condition, which is satisﬁed after a scaling, if necessary, for our original manifold M.

From the construction of Ricci ﬂow with surgery, each time slice (M(t), g(t)) con-
sists of an AE manifold and a ﬁnite number of compact components. Moreover, we
can recover the topology of M(0) = M by performing connected sum operations
among M(t) and ﬁnitely many S3/Γ and S1 × S2 for any t > 0.

7. Proof of Theorem 1.3

We ﬁrst have the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 7.1. For a Ricci ﬂow with surgery M, a connected open subset X ⊂ M
is called a path of components if for every time t, the intersection X (t) of X with
each time-slice M(t) is a connected component of M(t).

We set M0 to be the path of components of M such that M0(t) is an AE manifold
Next we quote a local regularity lemma.

for any t ≥ 0.

Lemma 7.2. [23, Lemma 3.1] Let M be a Ricci ﬂow with surgery, with normalized
intial condition. Given T > 1
100 , there are numbers µ = µ(T ) ∈ (0, 1), σ = σ(T ) ∈
(0, 1), i0 = i0(T ) > 0 and Ak = Ak(T ) < ∞, k ≥ 0, with the following property. If
t ∈ ( 1

100 , T ] and |R(x, t)| < µρ(0)−2 − r(T )−2, put Q = |R(x, t)| + r(t)−2. Then
(1) The forward/backward parabolic ball P±(x, t, σQ− 1

(2) |Rm| ≤ A0Q, inj ≥ i0Q− 1

no intersection with the surgery cap.

2 ) is unscathed, that is, with

2 )∪

P−(x, t, σQ− 1

2 ) of the forward and backward parabolic balls.

Now we take a sequence of {Mi} of Ricci ﬂows with surgery, where we let δi(0) → 0,
hence ρi and hi also go to 0. We ﬁrst prove a stability result, which shows that on
the ﬁnite time interval, all surgeries are done in a compact set.
Theorem 7.3. Let {Mi} be a sequence of Ricci ﬂows with surgery with Mi(0) = M
and limi→∞ δi(0) = 0. For any S > 0, T > 0, there exists a compact set K ⊂ M such
that for suﬃciently large i, the cylinder K c × [0, T ] exists in Mi and |Rmi| ≤ S.
Proof. We prove it by contradiction.

Assume there is a sequence (xj)j∈N on M with dg(xj, ⋆) = 2ri where ⋆ is a ﬁxed
point on M and ri → ∞ such that |Rmj|(xj, tj) > S for some tj ∈ [0, T ].
By the AE condition, balls (Bg(xj, rj), g, xj) converges smoothly to (Rn, gE, 0). Then
there exists a θ > 0 suﬃciently small such that Bg(xj, rj)× [0, θ] exists in Mj and for
any A > 0, restriction of Gj on Bg(xj, A)× [0, θ] converges smoothly to the Euclidean
metric on BgE (0, A) × [0, θ].
Therefore for any A > 0, we assume |Rm| ≤ S/2 on Bg(xj, A) × [0, θ] for j suf-
ﬁciently large. From Lemma 7.2, there exists Q, σ, Ak, θ′ = σQ− 1
2 , all of which de-
pend on S, T, r, κ, (M, g), such that the forward parabolic ball P+(xj, θ, θ′) and the
backward parabolic ball P−(xj, θ, θ′) are unscathed and |∇kRm| ≤ AkQ1+ k
2 with
inj ≥ i0Q− 1
2 on Bg(xj, A) × [θ − θ′, θ + θ′] for j suﬃciently large. By taking a diago-
nal subsequence, we have Bg(xj, rj) × [0, θ + θ′] converges smoothly to the Euclidean
metric on Rn × [0, θ + θ′].

RICCI FLOW ON ASYMPTOTICALLY EUCLIDEAN MANIFOLDS

33

Now we can continue this process, since θ′ does not depend on δj, to conlude that
Bg(xj, ri) × [0, T ] converges smoothly to the Euclidean metric on Rn × [0, T ] and
|Rmj| ≤ S/2 on Bg(xj, 1) × [0, T ]. This is a contradiction.

(cid:3)

By the evolution equation for the volume ∂tdVt = −RdVt ≤ 0 and the fact that
the surgery process is volume-decreasing, it is true that for any compact set A ⊂ M,
Volt(A) is decreasing.
From Theorem 3.3, we can ﬁnd a constant ǫ0 > 0 such that µS2×R(gc, 1) ≤ −2ǫ0,
where gc is the standard metric on the cylinder with scalar curvature R = 1. There-
fore, we choose the parameter ǫ for the surgery as follows, for any ǫ-neck with metric
g and center p, we have µS2×(−ǫ−1,ǫ−1)(R(p)g, 1) ≤ −ǫ0.

From Theorem 3.4, there exits a constant T > 0 such that

(7.1)

µM (g, τ ) ≥ −ǫ0/2

for any τ ≥ T .
From Theorem 7.3, there exists a compact set K ⊂ M such that |Rmi| ≤ 1 on
(M\K)× [0, T ] and we can ﬁnd a common AE coordinate system for all gi(T ). More-
over from maximum principle it is easy to show that Mi
0(T )\(M − K) have uniform
positive lower bound of scalar curvature. Hence, from Theorem 3.7 there exists T ′ > T
such that

(7.2)

µM (gi(T ), τ ) ≥ −ǫ0/2

for any τ ≥ T ′ − T and i.
Now we take a sequence of Ricci ﬂow with surgery {Mi} with initial condition
(M, g) subject to a uniform r(t) > 0 and surgery parameter δi(0) → 0. Since all r(t)
and δi(t) are decreasing, we can choose r > 0, δi → 0 as constant parameters on the
time interval [0, T ′].
With all those preparations, Theorem 1.3 follows immediately from Theorem 1.2

and the following theorem.

0 for i suﬃciently large.

Theorem 7.4. There are ﬁnitely many surgeries for Mi

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.3: If the Ricci ﬂow has long time existence, the result follows
from Theorem 1.2. Therefore we can assume that the Ricci ﬂow has at least one
surgery. From Theorem 7.4, if the surgery control function is chosen to be small
enough, there are only ﬁnitely many surgeries and hence after the last surgery time
the Ricci ﬂow has long time existence. Since the mass is preserved along Ricci ﬂow
and surgery times, the mass is nonnegative by Theorem 1.2. If the equality holds,
then again from Theorem 1.2, the metric after the last surgery is Euclidean, which is
impossible.

Corollary 7.5. [35, Corollary 6] Any orientable AE 3-manifold M with scalar cur-
vature R ≥ 0 has the following diﬀeomorphism type

M ∼= R3#S3/Γ1# . . . #S3/Γk#(S2 × S1)# . . . #(S2 × S1)

where there are ﬁnitely many connected sums.
Proof. From Theorem 7.4, we have a Ricci ﬂow with surgery M such that there are
only ﬁnitely many surgeries on M0. After a large time T , the Ricci ﬂow on M0(T )
has longtime existence, each of whose timeslice by Theorem 1.2 is diﬀeomorphic to
R3. Moreover, at time T , all other ﬁnitely many components of M(T ) are compact
manifolds with R > 0. Therefore they must extinct after ﬁnite time. Therefore we
can recover the diﬀeomorphism type of M by performing connected sum of R3 with
ﬁnitely many S3/Γ and S2 × S1.

Remark 7.6. Robert Haslhofer obtained the same result, see details in [35, Corollary
6], by using the min-max argument of Colding-Minicozzi [13].

Appendix A. Gradient Ricci soliton on ALE manifold

In this section we prove some facts about Ricci gradient soliton on ALE manfold.

Deﬁnition A.1. A smooth Riemannian manifold (M n, g) is called an asymptotically
locally Euclidean (ALE) end of order σ > 0 if there exist a ﬁnite subgroup Γ ⊂ O(n)
acting freely on Rn\B(0, R), a compact set K ⊂ M n and a C∞ diﬀeomorphism
Φ : M n\K → (Rn\B(0, R))/Γ such that under this identiﬁcation,
(A.1)

gij = δij + O(r−σ),

∂|k|gij = O(r−σ−k),

(A.2)
for any partial derivatives of order k as r → ∞, where r is the Euclidean distance.
A complete, noncompact manifold (M n, g) is called ALE if M n can be written as the
disjoint union of a compact set and ﬁnitely many ALE ends [8] [39]. For an ALE end,
if the group Γ in the deﬁnition is trivial, we call it a trivial end or AE end, otherwise
we call it a nontrivial end.

Deﬁnition A.2. A metric g for a manifold M n is called a gradient Ricci soliton if
there is a smooth function f : M n → R such that
(A.3)
It is called steady when λ = 0, shrinking when λ = −1 and expanding when λ = 1.
In [20] R. Hamilton proved the following identity for gradient steady Ricci solitons

Ric + Hess(f ) + λg = 0.

R + |∇f|2 = Λ

(A.4)
where Λ is a constant. Since on ALE manifold scalar curvature R = O(r−2−σ), |∇f| is
bounded from (A.4). Therefore the metric g is a complete steady Ricci soliton, i.e., the
vector ﬁeld ∇f is complete. By the standard result in Ricci ﬂow, for example in [12],
there exists an eternal solution g(t) (−∞ < t < ∞) of the Ricci ﬂow with g(0) = g
such that g(t) = φ(t)∗g where φ(t) is the 1-parameter family of diﬀeomorphisms
generated by ∇f .
Since the solution g(t) is self-similar, its curvature operater Rm(t) is uniformly
bounded as Rm(0) is bounded for ALE manifold. Moreover, R ≥ 0 for every bounded
ancient solution of Ricci ﬂow, see [9]. By the strong maximum principle either R > 0
or M is Ricci-ﬂat. In the ﬁrst case, by rescaling we can assume

(A.5)

R + |∇f|2 = 1.

If the steady gradient Ricci soliton is nontrivial, the manifold has to be one-ended,
see [29].

Then we have

Theorem A.3. If (M n, g) is an ALE manifold such that g is a gradient steady Ricci
soliton, then g is Ricci-ﬂat.

Proof. (Nontrivial end) If M n is not Ricci-ﬂat, we assume (A.5) holds.

38

YU LI

We assume the end E = (Rn\B(0, R))/Γ is a nontrivial end, that is, |Γ| > 1. By

taking trace of (A.3), we have

R + ∆f = 0

(A.6)
We consider the annulus Ca,A = {x ∈ E | a < d(x) = d(x, O) < A} where O is a
ﬁxed point in M n and a a ﬁxed large number. On the geodesic sphere SA = {x ∈ E |
f (x) and hence ∇f (c) and ∇r(c)
d(x) = A} there is a point c such that f (c) = max
x∈SR
are parallel. From conditions on ALE end, g → gE, r → d, |∇f| → 1 , and∇r → ∇d
uniformly when d(x) → ∞. So if A is suﬃcently large, we can assume
(A.7)

h∇f (c),∇d(c)i ≥ 1 − ǫ

or

(A.8)

for a small number ǫ > 0.

h∇f (c),∇d(c)i ≤ −(1 − ǫ)

If (A.7) holds, for any point b on SA we can ﬁnd a minimal geodesic γ(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ l

Since |Γ| > 1, if A is large, any point b on SA can be connected to c by a minimal

ZCa,A −R dV =ZCa,A

∆f dσ

for some constant C2, C3, C4 > 0. So from (A.17) and (A.18), we also have a contra-
diction if A → ∞.
(Trivial end):Assume the ALE end E of M n is trivial. From Theorem 3.3, we can
assume for all τ > 0, µ(g, τ ) < 0 since the Ricci ﬂow solution of the steady soliton is
eternal and M n is not Ricci-ﬂat.

For any ¯τ > 0, by the monotonicity formula, µ(g(t), ¯τ − t) is increasing for all

0 ≤ t < ¯τ . Therefore

µ(g(t), ¯τ − t) = µ(φ(t)∗g, ¯τ − t) = µ(g, ¯τ − t)

is increasing for all 0 ≤ t < ¯τ . Since ¯τ can be any positive number, µ(g, τ ) is
decreasing for all τ > 0. So it contradicts Theorem 3.4. Thus, the proof of Theorem
A.3 is complete.

Theorem A.4. If (M n, g) is an ALE manifold such that g is a gradient shrinking
Ricci soliton, then (M n, g) = (Rn, gE).

The proof of A.4 follows immediately from the next theorem since by the ALE

condition |Rm| ≤ Cr−2−σ.
Theorem A.5. Let (M n, g(t)), t ∈ (−∞, 0] be a non-ﬂat κ-noncollapsed type-I an-

Proof. We assume the contrary. Let (xi)i∈N be a sequence of points going to inﬁnity
such that |Rm|(xi, 0)λi → 0 where λi = d2
0(xi, O). Then from [15, Theorem 4.1],
(M, 1
g(λit), xi) converges smoothly to a nonﬂat shrinking soliton (M∞, g∞(t), x∞)

for t < 0.

By our assumption and the κ-noncollapsed condition, we conclude further that
i g(0)(xi, 1/2), λ−1
(Bλ−1
i g(λit), xi) converges to (Bg∞(0)(x∞, 1/2), g∞(t), x∞) for t ≤ 0
from Cheeger-Gromov compactness theorem. Then we have Rm∞(0) = 0 on the met-
ric ball Bg∞(0)(x∞, 1/2). Since any shrinking soliton has nonnegative scalar curvature,
by the strong maximum principle, R∞(t) = 0 for any t < 0 and hence Ricci-ﬂat from

2

Therefore we have a contradiction.

Remark A.6. It was proved in [10] that lim inf d(x,O)→∞ R(x)d2(x, O) > 0 for any
non-ﬂat shrinking soliton.

There are nontrivial examples of expanding soliton on ALE manifold, see the con-

structions in [28].
