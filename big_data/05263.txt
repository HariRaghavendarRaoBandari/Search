ON A ISOPERIMETRIC-ISODIAMETRIC INEQUALITY

ANDREA MONDINO AND EMANUELE SPADARO

Abstract. The Euclidean mixed isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality states that the round ball
maximizes the volume under constraint on the product between boundary area and radius. The
goal of the paper is to investigate such mixed isoperimetric-isodiametric inequalities in Riemannian
manifolds. We ﬁrst prove that the same inequality, with the sharp Euclidean constants, holds on
Cartan-Hadamard spaces as well as on minimal submanifolds of Rn. The equality cases are also
studied and completely characterized; in particular, the latter gives a new link with free boundary
minimal submanifolds in a Euclidean ball. We also consider the case of manifolds with non-negative
Ricci curvature and prove a new comparison result stating that metric balls in the manifold have
product of boundary area and radius bounded by the Euclidean counterpart and equality holds if
and only if the ball is actually Euclidean.
We then pass to consider the problem of the existence of optimal shapes (i.e. regions minimizing
the product of boundary area and radius under the constraint of having ﬁxed enclosed volume),
called here isoperimetric-isodiametric regions. While it is not diﬃcult to show existence if the
ambient manifold is compact, the situation changes dramatically if the manifold is not compact:
indeed we give examples of spaces where there exists no isoperimetric-isodiametric region (e.g.
minimal surfaces with planar ends and more generally C 0-locally-asymptotic Euclidean Cartan-
Hadamard manifolds), and we prove that on the other hand on C 0-locally-asymptotic Euclidean
manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature there exists an isoperimetric-isodiametric region for
every positive volume (this class of spaces includes a large family of metrics playing a key role in
general relativity and Ricci ﬂow: the so called Hawking gravitational instantons and the Bryant-
type Ricci solitons).
Finally we pass to prove the optimal regularity of the boundary of isoperimetric-isodiametric regions:
in the part which does not touch a minimal enclosing ball the boundary is a smooth hypersurface
outside of a closed subset of Hausdorﬀ co-dimension 8, and in a neighborhood of the contact region
the boundary is a C 1,1-hypersurface with explicit estimates on the L∞-norm of the mean curvature.

1. Introduction

One of the oldest questions of mathematics is the isoperimetric problem: What is the largest
amount of volume that can be enclosed by a given amount of area? A related classical question is
the isodiametric problem: What is the largest amount of volume that can be enclosed by a domain
having a ﬁxed diameter?

In this paper we address a mix of the previous two questions, namely we investigate the follow-
ing mixed isoperimetric-isodiametric problem: What is the largest amount of volume that can be
enclosed by a domain having a ﬁxed product of diameter and boundary area?

Of course, if we ask the three above questions in the Euclidean space, the answer is given by the
round balls of the suitable radius; but, of course, the situation in non-ﬂat geometries is much more
subtle. We start by recalling classical material on the isoperimetric problem which motivated our
investigation on the mixed isoperimetric-isodiametric one.

The solution of the isoperimetric problem in the Euclidean space Rn can be summarized by the

classical isoperimetric inequality

n

n Vol(Ω)

n ω

n−1

n ≤ A(∂Ω) ,

for every Ω ⊂ Rn open subset with smooth boundary,

(1.1)

where Vol(Ω) is the n-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure of Ω (i.e. the “volume” of Ω), A(∂Ω) is the
(n − 1)-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure of ∂Ω (i.e. the “area” of ∂Ω), and ωn := Vol(Bn) is the
volume of the unit ball in Rn. As it is well known, the regularity assumption on Ω can be relaxed a
lot (for instance (1.1) holds for every set Ω of ﬁnite perimeter) but let us not enter in technicalities
here since we are just motivating our problem.

As anticipated above, in the present paper we will not deal with the isoperimetric problem
itself but we will focus on a mixed isoperimetric-isodiametric problem. Let us start by stating

ON A ISOPERIMETRIC-ISODIAMETRIC INEQUALITY

3

the Euclidean mixed isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality which will act as model for this paper.
Given a bounded open subset Ω ⊂ Rn with smooth boundary, by the divergence theorem in Rn
(see Section 2 for the easy proof), we have

n Vol(Ω) ≤ rad(Ω) A(∂Ω),

(1.2)

where rad(Ω) is the radius of the smallest ball of Rn containing Ω (see (2.1) for the precise deﬁnition).
As observed in Remark 2.1, inequality (1.2) is sharp and rigid; indeed, equality occurs if and only
if Ω is a round ball in Rn.

In sharp contrast with the classical isoperimetric problem, where both problems are still open
in the general case, it is not diﬃcult to show that the inequality (1.2) holds in Cartan-Hadamard
spaces (i.e. simply connected Riemannian manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature) and on
minimal submanifolds of Rn, see Proposition 3.1, Proposition 3.3 and Proposition 3.7. Even if the
validity of inequality (1.2) in such spaces is probably known to experts, we included it here in order
to motivate the reader and also because the equality case for minimal submanifolds present an
interesting link with free-boundary minimal surfaces: equality is attained in (1.2) if and only if the
minimal submanifold is a free boundary minimal surface in a Euclidean ball (see Proposition 3.3
for the precise statement and Remarks 3.5-3.6 for more information about free boundary minimal
surfaces).

If on one hand the negative curvature gives a stronger isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality, on
the the other hand we show that non-negative Ricci curvature forces metric balls to satisfy a weaker
isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality. The precise statement is the following.

Theorem 1.1 (Theorem 4.1). Let (M n, g) be a complete (possibly non compact) Riemannian n-
manifold. Let Br ⊂ M be a metric ball of volume V = Volg(Br), and denote with B Rn
(V ) the
round ball in Rn having volume V . Then

rad(Br) A(∂Br) = r A(∂Br) ≤ n Volg(Br) = radRn(B Rn

(V )) ARn(∂B Rn

(V )).

(1.3)

Moreover equality holds if and only if Br is isometric to a round ball in the Euclidean space Rn. In
particular, for every V ∈ (0, Volg(M )) it holds

inf{rad(Ω)P(Ω) : Ω ⊂ M, Volg(Ω) = V } ≤ nV = inf{rad(Ω)P(Ω) : Ω ⊂ Rn, VolRn(Ω) = V },

(1.4)
with equality for some V ∈ (0, Volg(M )) if and only if every metric ball in M of volume V is
isometric to a round ball in Rn. In particular if equality occurs for some V ∈ (0, Volg(M )) then
(M, g) is ﬂat, i.e. it has identically zero sectional curvature.

Remark 1.2. Since by Bishop-Gromov volume comparison we know that if Ricg ≥ 0 then for
every metric ball Br(x0) ⊂ M it holds Volg(Br(x0)) ≤ ωnrn = VolRn(B Rn

r ), it follows that

rad(Br(x0)) ≥ radRn(B Rn

(V )),

where B Rn
(V ) is a Euclidean ball of volume V = Volg(Br(x0)). Therefore Theorem 1.1 in particular
implies that P(Br(x0)) ≤ PRn(B Rn
(V )), but is a strictly stronger statement which at best of our
knowledge is original. The aforementioned counterpart of Theorem 1.1 for the isoperimetric problem

4

was proved instead by Morgan-Johnson [42, Theorem 3.5] for compact manifolds and extended to
non-compact manifolds in [41, Proposition 3.2].
(cid:3)

In Section 5 we investigate the existence of optimal shapes in a general Riemannian manifold
(M, g). More precisely, given a measurable subset E ⊂ M we denote with P(E) its perimeter and
deﬁne its extrinsic radius as

rad(E) := inf {r > 0 : Volg(E \ Br(z0)) = 0 for some z0 ∈ M } ,

where Br(z0) denotes the open metric ball with center z0 and radius r > 0. We consider the
following minimization problem: for every ﬁxed V ∈ (0, Volg(M )),

min n rad(E) P(E) : E ⊂ M, Volg(E) = Vo,

(1.5)

and call the minimizers of (1.5) isoperimetric-isodiametric sets (or regions). To best of our knowl-
edge this is ﬁrst time such a problem is considered in literature.
As it happens also for the isoperimetric problem, we will ﬁnd that if the ambient manifold is
compact then for every volume there exists an isoperimetric-isodiametric region (see Theorem 5.2
and Corollary 5.3) but if the ambient space is non-compact the situation changes dramatically.
Indeed in Examples 5.6-5.7 we show that in complete minimal submanifolds with planar ends (like
the helicoid) and in asymptotically locally Euclidean Cartan-Hadamard manifolds there exists no
isoperimetric-isodiametric region of positive volume. On the other hand, we show that in C 0-locally
asymptotically Euclidean manifolds (see Deﬁnition 5.4 for the precise notion) with non negative
Ricci curvature for every volume there exists an isoperimetric-isodiametric region:

Theorem 1.3 (Theorem 5.5). Let (M, g) be a complete Riemannian n-manifold with non-negative
Ricci curvature and ﬁx any reference point ¯x ∈ M . Assume that for any diverging sequence of
points (xk)k∈N ⊂ M , i.e. d(xk, ¯x) → ∞, the sequence of pointed manifolds (M, g, xk) converges in
the pointed C 0-topology to the Euclidean space (Rn, gRn, 0).
Then for every V ∈ (0, Volg(M )) there exists a minimizer of the problem (1.5), in other words there
exists an isoperimetric-isodiametric region of volume V .

Let us mention that the counterpart of Theorem 1.3 for the isoperimetric problem was proved

in [41] capitalizing on the work by Nardulli [43].

Remark 1.4. It is well known that the only manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature and
C 0-globally asymptotic to Rn is Rn itself. Indeed if M is C 0-globally asymptotic to Rn then

lim
R→∞

Volg(BR(¯x))

ωnRn

= 1,

which by the rigidity statement associated to the Bishop-Gromov inequality implies that (M, g) is
globally isometric to Rn. On the other hand, the assumption of Theorem 1.3 is much weaker as it
ask (M, g) to be just locally asymptotic to Rn in C 0 topology and many important examples enter
in this framework as explained in next Example 1.5.
(cid:3)

Example 1.5. The class of manifolds satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 1.3 contains many
geometrically and physically relevant examples.

• Eguchi-Hanson and more generally ALE gravitational instantons. These are 4-manifolds,
solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations with null cosmological constant (i.e. they are
Ricci ﬂat, Ricg ≡ 0), they are non-compact with just one end which is topologically a
quotient of R4 by a ﬁnite subgroup of O(4), and the Riemannian metric g on this end is
asymptotic to the Euclidean metric up to terms of order O(r−4),

gij = δij + O(r−4),

with appropriate decay in the derivatives of gij (in particular, such metrics are C 0-locally
asymptotic, in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.4, to the Euclidean 4-dimensional space). The
ﬁrst example of such manifolds was discovered by Eguchi and Hanson in [19]; the authors,
inspired by the discovery of self-dual instantons in Yang-Mills Theory, found a self-dual
ALE instanton metric. The Eguchi-Hanson example was then generalized by Gibbons and
Hawking [23], see also the work by Hitchin [29]. These metrics constitute the building blocks
of the Euclidean quantum gravity theory of Hawking (see [27, 28]). The ALE Gravitational
Instantons were classiﬁed in 1989 by Kronheimer (see [34, 35]).

• Bryant-type solitons. The Bryant solitons, discovered by R. Bryant [10], are special but
fundamental solutions to the Ricci ﬂow (see for instance the work of Brendle [8, 9] for
higher dimension). Such metrics are complete, have non-negative Ricci curvature (they
actually satisfy the stronger condition of having nonnegative curvature operator) and are
locally C 0-asymptotically Euclidean. Other soliton examples ﬁtting our assumptions are
given by Catino-Mazzieri in [15].
(cid:3)

The last Section 6 is then devoted to establish the optimal regularity for isoperimetric-isodiametric
regions under suitable assumptions on regularity of the enclosing ball. We ﬁrst observe that outside
of the contact region with the minimal enclosing ball B, such sets are locally minimizers of the
perimeter under volume constraint. Therefore by classical results (see, for example, [40, Corollary
3.8]) in the interior of B the boundary of the region is a smooth hypersurface outside a singular
set of Hausdorﬀ co-dimension at least 8.

The rest of the paper is devoted to prove the optimal regularity at the contact region. We ﬁrst
show in Section 6.1 that isoperimetric-isodiametric regions are almost-minimizers for the perimeter
(see Lemma 6.3) and therefore, by a result of Tamanini [47] their boundaries are C 1,1/2 regular
(see Proposition 6.1). In Section 6.2, by means of geometric comparisons and sharp ﬁrst variation
arguments, we show that the mean curvature of the boundary of an isoperimetric-isodiametric
region is in L∞ with explicit estimates. Finally in Section 6.3 we establish the optimal C 1,1
regularity. We mention that, strictly speaking, Section 6.2 is not needed to prove the optimal
regularity; in any case we included such section since provides an explicit sharp L∞-estimate on
the mean curvature and is of independent interest. Now the let us state the main regularity result.

Theorem 1.6 (Theorem 6.11). Let E ⊂ M be an isoperimetric-isodiametric set and x0 ∈ M be
such that Volg(E \ Brad(E)(x0)) = 0. Assume that B := Brad(E)(x0)) has smooth boundary. Then,
there exists δ > 0 such that ∂E \ Brad(E)−δ(x0) is C 1,1 regular.

6

ANDREA MONDINO AND EMANUELE SPADARO

An essential ingredient in the proof of Theorem 1.6 is Proposition 6.12, which roughly tells that
the boundary of E leaves the obstacle at most quadratically. Then the conclusion will follow by
combining Schauder estimates outside of the contact region (see Lemma 6.13) with the general fact
that functions which leave the ﬁrst order approximation quadratically are C 1,1 – see Lemma 6.14.
Although the techniques exploited for this part of the paper are inspired by the ones introduced in
the study of the classical obstacle problem (cf., for example, [12]), here we treat the geometric case
of the area functional in a Riemannian manifold with volume constraints and we take several short-
cuts by thanks to some speciﬁcally geometric arguments, such as the theory of almost minimizers.

Remark 1.7. Note that the C 1,1 regularity is optimal, because in general one cannot expect to
have continuity of the second fundamental form of ∂E across the free boundary of ∂E, i.e. the
points on the relative (with respect to ∂B) boundary of ∂E ∩ ∂B. The same is indeed true for the
simplest case of the classical obstacle problem.

2. Notation, Preliminaries and the Euclidean case

Let (Z, d) be a metric space. Given an open subset Ω ⊂ Z, we deﬁne its extrinsic radius as

rad(Ω) := inf{r > 0 : Ω ⊂ Br(z0) for some z0 ∈ Z} ,

(2.1)

where Br(z0) denotes the open metric ball of center z0 and radius r > 0.

The model inequality for the ﬁrst part of the paper is the Euclidean mixed isoperimetric-
isodiametric inequality obtained by the following integration by parts. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded
open subset with smooth boundary and let x0 ∈ Rn be a point such that

max
x∈ ¯Ω

|x − x0| = rad(Ω).

(2.2)

Denoted with X the vector ﬁeld X(x) := x − x0, by the divergence theorem in Rn we then get

n Vol(Ω) =ZΩ

div X d Hn = −Z∂Ω

X · ν dHn−1 ≤ rad(Ω) A(∂Ω),

(2.3)

where Vol(Ω) denotes the Euclidean n-dimensional volume of Ω, ν is the inward pointing unit
normal vector and A(∂Ω) is the Euclidean (n − 1)-dimensional area of ∂Ω, which here is assumed
to be smooth. Notice that, analogously, if Ω ⊂ Rn is a ﬁnite perimeter set one gets the inequality

Vol(Ω) ≤

rad(Ω)

n

P(Ω),

(2.4)

where, of course, P(Ω) denotes the perimeter of Ω (see § 5.1 for the deﬁnitions of P(Ω) and rad(Ω)
for ﬁnite perimeter sets).

Remark 2.1. The inequalities (2.3) and (2.4) are sharp and rigid: indeed equality occurs if and
only if Ω is a round ball.
(cid:3)

3. Euclidean isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality in Cartan-Hadamard manifolds

and minimal submanifolds

In order to motivate and gently introduce the reader to the topic, in this section we will prove
that the Euclidean isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality holds with the same constant in Cartan-
Hadamard spaces and in minimal submanifolds. Possibly apart from the rigidity statements, here
we do not claim originality since such inequalities are probably well known to experts (cf. [11], [30],
[39]). However we included this section for the following reasons:

• While for the isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality the proofs are a consequence of a non dif-
ﬁcult integration by parts argument, the corresponding statements for the classical isoperi-
metric inequality are still open problems (see Remark 3.2 and Remark 3.4). This suggest
that possibly also in other situations isoperimetric-isodiametric inequalities may behave
better than the classical isoperimetric ones.

• The rigidity statements, in case of minimal submanifolds, show interesting connections
between the isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality and free boundary minimal surfaces, a
topic which recently has received a lot of attention (for more details see Remark 3.5 and
Remark 3.6).

3.1. The case of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. Recall that a Cartan-Hadamard n-manifold
is a complete simply connected Riemannian n-dimensional manifold with non-positive sectional
curvature. By a classical theorem of Cartan and Hadamard (see for instance [18]) such manifolds
are diﬀeomorphic to Rn via the exponential map. The next result is a sharp and rigid mixed
isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality in such spaces. For this section, without loosing much, the
non-expert reader may assume the region Ω ⊂ M to have smooth boundary, in this case the
perimeter is just the standard (n − 1)-volume of the boundary (the perimeter will instead play a
role in the next sections about existence and regularity of optimal sets).

Proposition 3.1. Let (M n, g) be a Cartan-Hadamard manifold. Then for every smooth open subset
(or more generally for every ﬁnite perimeter set) Ω ⊂ M n it holds

n Vol(Ω) ≤ rad(Ω) A(∂Ω)

(3.1)

where Vol(Ω) denotes the n-dimensional Riemannian volume of Ω and A(∂Ω) the (n−1)-dimensional
area of the smooth boundary ∂Ω (in case Ω is a ﬁnite perimeter set, just replace A(∂Ω) with P(Ω),
the perimeter of Ω in the right hand side, and rad(Ω) is as in § 5.11). Moreover if for some Ω the
equality is achieved, then Ω is isometric to an Euclidean ball.

Proof. Let Ω ⊂ M n be a subset with ﬁnite perimeter; without loss of generality we can assume
that Ω is bounded (otherwise rad(Ω) = +∞ and the inequality is trivial). Let x0 ∈ M n be such

1For readers’ convenience we recall here the deﬁnition of rad(Ω) for a ﬁnite perimeter set Ω ⊂ M : rad(Ω) :=

inf{r > 0 : Vol(Ω \ Br) = 0, Br ⊂ M metric ball}.

where d is the Riemannian distance on (M n, g), for convenience we will also denote dx0(·) := d(x0, ·).
Let u := 1

2
that u : M n → R+ is smooth and by the Hessian comparison Theorem one has (D2u)ij ≥ gij; in
particular, by tracing, we get ∆u ≥ n. Therefore, by the divergence theorem, we infer

n Vol(Ω) ≤ ZΩ

∆u dµg = −Z∂ ∗Ω

g(∇u, ν) d Hn−1 = −Z∂ ∗Ω

≤ rad(Ω) Hn−1(∂∗Ω) = rad(Ω) P(Ω),

d(x, x0) g(∇dx0, ν) d Hn−1

(3.2)

where µg is the measure associated to the Riemannian volume form, ∂∗Ω is the reduced boundary
of Ω (of course, in case Ω is a smooth open subset one has ∂∗Ω = ∂Ω), ν is the inward pointing unit
normal vector (recall that it is Hn−1-a.e. well deﬁned on ∂∗Ω), and we used that dx0 is 1-Lipschitz.
Of course (3.2) implies (3.1). Notice that if equality holds in the second line, then Ω is a metric ball
of center x0 and radius rad(Ω). Moreover if equality occurs in the ﬁrst inequality of the ﬁrst line
then we must have (D2d2
x0)ij ≡ 2gij on Ω, and by standard comparison (see for instance [45, Section
4.1]) it follows that Ω is ﬂat. But since the exponential map in M is a global diﬀeomorphism it
follows that Ω is isometric to an Euclidean ball.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.2 (Euclidean isoperimetric inequality on Cartan-Hadamard spaces). The statement
corresponding to Proposition 3.1 for the isoperimetric problem is the following celebrated con-
jecture: Let (M n, g) be a Cartan-Hadamard space, i.e. a complete simply connected Riemannian
n-manifold with non-positive sectional curvature. Then every smooth open subset Ω ⊂ M n satisﬁes
the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality.
This conjecture is generally attributed to Aubin [4, Conj. 1] but has its roots in earlier work by
Weil [48], as we are going to explain. The problem has been solved aﬃrmatively in the following
cases:
in dimension 2 by Weil [48] in 1926 (Beckenbach and Rad´o [6] gave an independent proof
in 1933, capitalizing on a result of Carleman [14] for minimal surfaces), in dimension 3 by Kleiner
[33] in 1992 (see also the survey paper by Ritor´e [45] for a variant of Kleiner’s arguments), and in
dimension 4 by Croke [17] in 1984. An interesting feature of this problem is that the above proofs
have nothing to do one with the other and that they work only for one speciﬁc dimension; probably
also for this reason such a problem is still open in the general case.
(cid:3)

3.2. The case of minimal submanifolds. Given a smoothly immersed submanifold M n ֒→
Rn+k, by the ﬁrst variation formula for the area functional we know that for every Ω ⊂ M n open
bounded subset with smooth boundary and every smooth vector ﬁeld X along Ω it holds

ZΩ

divM X d Hn = −ZΩ

H · X d Hn −Z∂Ω

X · ν d Hn−1,

(3.3)

where H is the mean curvature vector of M and ν is the inward pointing conormal to Ω (i.e. ν is
the unit vector tangent to M , normal to ∂Ω and pointing inside Ω).

ON A ISOPERIMETRIC-ISODIAMETRIC INEQUALITY

9

We are interested in the case M n ֒→ Rn+k is a minimal submanifold, i.e. H ≡ 0, and Ω ⊂ M n

is a bounded open subset with smooth boundary ∂Ω. Let x0 ∈ Rn+k be such that

and observe that, called X(x) := x − x0, one has divM X ≡ n. By applying (3.3), we then infer

max
x∈ ¯Ω

|x − x0|Rn+k = radRn+k (Ω),

n Hn(Ω) =ZΩ

divM X d Hn = −Z∂Ω

X · ν d Hn−1 ≤ radRn+k (Ω) Hn−1(∂Ω).

(3.4)

Notice that equality is achieved if and only if Ω is the intersection of M with a round ball in Rn+k
centered at x0 and ν(x) is parallel to x − x0, or in other words if and only if Ω is a free boundary
minimal n-submanifold in a ball of Rn+k. So we have just proved the following result.

Proposition 3.3. Let M n ֒→ Rn+k be a minimal submanifold and Ω ⊂ M n a bounded open subset
with smooth boundary ∂Ω. Then

n Hn(Ω) ≤ radRn+k (Ω) Hn−1(∂Ω)

with equality if and only if Ω is a free boundary minimal n-submanifold in a ball of Rn+k.

Remark 3.4 (Euclidean isoperimetric inequality on minimal submanifolds). The statement cor-
responding to Proposition 3.3 for the isoperimetric problem is the following celebrated conjecture:
Let M n ⊂ Rm be a minimal n-dimensional submanifold and let Ω ⊂ M n be a smooth open subset.
Then Ω satisﬁes the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality (1.1), and equality holds if and only if Ω is
a ball in an aﬃne n-plane of Rm.

To our knowledge the only two solved cases are i) when ∂Ω lies on an (m − 1)-dimensional
Euclidean sphere centered at a point of Ω (the argument is by monotonicity, see for instance [16,
Section 8.1]) and ii) when Ω is area minimizing with respect to its boundary ∂Ω by Almgren [2]. Let
us mention that a complete solution of the above conjecture is still not available even for minimal
surfaces in Rm, i.e. for n = 2; however, in the latter situation, the statement is known to be true
in many cases (let us just mention that in case Ω is a topological disk the problem was solved by
Carleman [14] in 1921, and the case m = 3 and ∂Ω has two connected components was settled much
later by Li-Schoen-Yau [36]; for more results in this direction and for a comprehensive overview see
the beautiful survey paper [16] by Choe). Let us ﬁnally observe that, when n = 2 and m = 3, the
above c onjecture is a special case of the Aubin Conjecture recalled in Remark 3.2, since of course
the induced metric on a immersed minimal surface in R3 has non-positive Gauss curvature; this
case was settled in the pioneering work by Weil [48].
(cid:3)

Remark 3.5 (Free boundary minimal submanifolds and critical metrics). After a classical work
of Nitsche [44] in the 80’ies, the last years have seen an increasing interest on free boundary
submanifolds also thanks to recent works of Fraser and Schoen [21, 22] on the topic. By deﬁnition,
a free boundary submanifold M n of the unit ball Bn+k, is a proper submanifold which is critical for
the area functional with respect to variations of M n that are allowed to move also the boundary
∂M n,but under the constraint ∂M n ⊂ ∂Bn+k. As a consequence of the 1st variational formula, such
deﬁnition forces on one hand the mean curvature to vanish on M n ∩ Bn+k and on the other hand

the submanifold to the meet the ambient boundary ∂Bn+k orthogonally. These are characterized
by the condition that the coordinate functions are Steklov eigenfunctions with eigenvalue 1 [21,
Lemma 2.2]; that is,

∆xi = 0 on M and ∇νxi = −xi on ∂M.

It turns out that surfaces of this type arise naturally as extremal metrics for the Steklov eigenvalues
(see [22] for more details); Steklov eigenvalues are eigenvalues of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map,
which sends a given smooth function on the boundary to the normal derivative of its harmonic
extension to the interior.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.6 (Examples of free boundary minimal submanifolds). Let us recall here some well
known examples of free boundary minimal submanifolds in the unit ball Bn+k ⊂ Rn+k, for a
deeper discussion on the examples below see [22].

• Equatorial Disk. Equatorial n-disks Dn ⊂ Bn+k are the simplest examples of free boundary
minimal submanifolds. By a result of Nitsche [44] any simply connected free boundary
minimal surface in B3 must be a ﬂat equatorial disk. However, if we admit minimal surfaces
of a diﬀerent topological type, there are other examples, as the critical catenoid described
below.

• Critical Catenoid. Consider the catenoid parametrized on R × S1 by the function

ϕ(t, θ) = (cosh t cos θ, cosh t sin θ, t) .

For a unique choice of T0 > 0, the restriction of ϕ to [−T0, T0] × S1 deﬁnes a minimal
embedding into a ball meeting the boundary of the ball orthogonally. By rescaling the
radius of the ball to 1 we get the critical catenoid in B3. Explicitly, T0 is the unique
positive solution of t = coth t.

• Critical M¨obius band. We think of the M¨obius band M 2 as R × S1 with the identiﬁcation

(t, θ) ∼ (−t, θ + π). There is a minimal embedding of M 2 into R4 given by

ϕ(t, θ) = (2 sinh t cos θ, 2 sinh t sin θ, cosh 2t cos 2θ, cosh 2t sin 2θ) .

For a unique choice of T0 > 0, the restriction of ϕ to [−T0, T0] × S1 deﬁnes a minimal
embedding into a ball meeting the boundary of the ball orthogonally. By rescaling the
radius of the ball to 1 we get the critical M¨obis band in B4. Explicitly T0 is the unique
positive solution of coth t = 2 tanh 2t.

• A consequence of the results of [22] is that for every k ≥ 1 there exists an embedded free

boundary minimal surface in B3 of genus 0 with k boundary components.

(cid:3)

Since of course radRn+k (Ω) ≤ radM (Ω), where radM (·) is the extrinsic radius in the metric space
(M, dg), we have a fortiori that

n Hn(Ω) ≤ radM (Ω) Hn−1(∂Ω).

(3.5)

But in this case the rigidity statement is much stronger, indeed in case of equality the center of the
ball x0 must be a point of M , moreover for every x ∈ ∂Ω the segment x, x0 must be contained in

ON A ISOPERIMETRIC-ISODIAMETRIC INEQUALITY

11

M , therefore M contains a portion of a minimal cone C centered at x0. But since by assumption
M is a smooth submanifold and since the only cone smooth at its origin is an aﬃne subspace, it
must be that M contains a portion of an aﬃne subspace. By the classical weak unique continuation
property for solutions to the minimal submanifold system, we conclude that M is an aﬃne subspace
of Rn+k. Therefore we have just proven the next result.

Proposition 3.7. Let M n ֒→ Rn+k be a connected smooth minimal submanifold and Ω ⊂ M n a
bounded open subset with smooth boundary ∂Ω. Then

n Hn(Ω) ≤ radM (Ω) Hn−1(∂Ω)

(3.6)

with equality if and only if M is an aﬃne subspace and Ω is the intersection of M with a round
ball in Rn+k centered at a point of M .

Remark 3.8. If we allow M to have conical singularities, then (3.6) still holds with equality if and
only if M is a minimal cone and Ω is the intersection of M with a round ball in Rn+k centered at
a point of M .

Concerning this, recall that in case n = 2 and k = 1 every minimal cone smooth away from the
vertex is totally geodesic, indeed one of the principal curvatures is always null for cones and so the
mean curvature vanishes if and only if all the second fundamental form is null. Therefore equality
in (3.6) is attained if and only if M 2 is an aﬃne plane and Ω is a ﬂat 2-disk. The analogous result
for n = 3 and k = 1 is due to Almgren [1] (see also the work of Calabi [13]).

For the general case of higher dimensions and co-dimensions note that a minimal submanifold Σk
in Sn is naturally the boundary of a minimal submanifold of the ball, the cone C(Σ) over Σ. Using
this correspondence it is possible to construct many non trivial minimal cones: Hsiang [31]-[32]
gave inﬁnitely many co-dimension 1 examples for n ≥ 4, the higher co-dimensional problem was
investigated in the celebrated paper of Simons [46] and the related work of Bombieri-De Giorgi-
Giusti [5].

posse concludere). If we assume V to be an integer rectiﬁable varifold after ﬁnitely many steps

we have exhausted the varifold.

4. The isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality in manifolds with non-negative Ricci

curvature

In this section we show a comparison result for manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature
which will be used in Section 5 to get existence of isoperimetric-isodiametric regions in manifolds
which are asymptotically locally Euclidean and have non-negative Ricci (the so called ALE spaces).

Theorem 4.1. Let (M n, g) be a complete (possibly non compact) Riemannian n-manifold. Let
Br ⊂ M be a metric ball of volume V = Vol(Br), and denote with B Rn
(V ) the round ball in Rn
having volume V . Then

rad(Br) P(Br) = r P(Br) ≤ nV = radRn(B Rn

(V )) PRn (B Rn

(V )).

(4.1)

12

ANDREA MONDINO AND EMANUELE SPADARO

Moreover equality holds if and only if Br is isometric to a round ball in the Euclidean space Rn. In
particular, for every V ∈ (0, Vol(M )) it holds

inf{rad(Ω)P(Ω) : Ω ⊂ M, Vol(Ω) = V } ≤ nV = inf{rad(Ω)P(Ω) : Ω ⊂ Rn, VolRn(Ω) = V },

(4.2)
with equality for some V ∈ (0, Vol(M )) if and only if every metric ball in M of volume V is
isometric to a round ball in Rn. In particular if equality occurs for some V ∈ (0, Vol(M )) then
(M, g) is ﬂat, i.e. it has identically zero sectional curvature.

Proof. Let us ﬁx an arbitrary x0 ∈ M and let Br = Br(x0) be the metric ball in M centered at
x0 of radius r > 0. It is well known that the distance function dx0(·) := d(x0, ·) is smooth outside
the cut locus Cx0 of x0 and that µg(Cx0) = 0. From the co-area formula it follows that for L1-a.e.
r ≥ 0 one has Hn−1(Cx0 ∩ ∂Br(x0)) = 0 and, since the cut locus is closed by deﬁnition, we get that
for L1-a.e. r ≥ 0 the distance function dx0(·) is smooth on an open subset of full Hn−1-measure on
∂Br(x0).
Let us ﬁrst assume that r > 0 is one of these regular radii, the general case will be settled in the end
by an approximation argument. It is immediate to see that on ∂Br(x0) \ Cx0 we have |∇dx0| = 1
and thus ∂Br(x0) \ Cx0 is a smooth hypersurface. In particular, since Hn−1(∂Br(x0) ∩ Cx0) = 0,
we have that Br(x0) is a ﬁnite perimeter set whose reduced boundary is contained ∂Br(x0) \ Cx0.
Called ν the inward pointing unit normal to ∂Br(x0) on the regular part ∂Br(x0) \ Cx0, from the
Gauss Lemma we have

ν = −∇dx0,

on ∂Br(x0) \ Cx0.

(4.3)

Therefore, called u := 1

d2
x0, we infer

rP(Br(x0)) = −Z∂Br(x0)\Cx0

dx0(x) g(∇dx0 (x), ν(x)) dHn−1(x) = −Z∂Br(x0)\Cx0

g(∇u, ν) dHn−1

= − lim

ε↓0Z∂Br(x0)\Cx0

g(∇uε, ν) dHn−1

where uε ∈ C 2(M ) is a approximation by convolution of u such that k∇uε −∇ukL∞(∂Br(x0),Hn−1) →
0, ∆uε → ∆u in C 0
loc(M \ Cx0) and ∆uε ≤ n where in the last estimate we used the global Laplacian
comparison stating that ∆u is a Radon measure with ∆u ≤ n µg. More precisely, one has that
∆uxM \ Cx0 is given by µg multiplied by a smooth function bounded above by n, and the singular
part (∆u)s of ∆u is a non-positive measure concentrated on Cx0. Now ∇uε is a C 1 vector ﬁeld and
we can apply the Gauss-Green formula for ﬁnite perimeter sets [3, Theorem 3.36] to infer

rP(Br(x0)) = lim

ε↓0ZBr(x0)

∆uε dµg = lim

ε↓0ZBr(x0)\Cx0

∆uε dµg ≤ZBr(x0)\Cx0

lim sup

ε↓0

∆uε dµg

∆u dµg ≤ n Vol(Br),

(4.4)

where the ﬁrst inequality we used Fatou’s Lemma combined with the upper bound ∆uε ≤ n and
the last inequality is ensured by the local Laplacian Comparison Theorem. Notice that if equality
occurs then ∆u = n µg on Br(x0) \ Cx0 and, by analyzing the equality in Riccati equations, it is
well known that this implies Br(x0) to be isometric to the round ball in Rn.

ON A ISOPERIMETRIC-ISODIAMETRIC INEQUALITY

13

If now r > 0 is a singular radius, in the sense that Hn−1(∂Br(x0) ∩ Cx0) > 0, then by the above
discussion we can ﬁnd a sequence of regular radii rn → r and, by the lower semicontinuity of
the perimeter under L1
loc convergence [3, Proposition 3.38] combined with (4.4) which is valid for
Brn(x0), we infer

rP(Br(x0)) ≤ lim inf

rnP(Brn(x0)) ≤ lim inf

∆u dµg ≤ lim sup

n→∞ ZM \Cx0

∆u dµg ≤ n Vol(Br),

(4.5)

where in the ﬁrst inequality of the second line we used Fatou’s Lemma (we are allowed since
χBrn (x0) ∆u ≤ n on M \ Cx0), and the last inequality follows again by local Laplacian comparison.
Notice that, as before, equality in (4.5) forces ∆u = n µg on Br(x0) \ Cx0 and then Br(x0) is
isometric to a Euclidean ball.

The second part of the statement clearly follows from the ﬁrst part combined with the Euclidean
(cid:3)

isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality (2.3).

5. Existence of isoperimetric-isodiametric regions

In Section 3 we have seen explicit isoperimetric-inequalities in some special situations: Cartan-
Hadamard spaces and minimal submanifolds. In the present section we investigate the existence of
optimal shapes: as it happens also for the isoperimetric problem, we will ﬁnd that if the ambient
manifold is compact an optimal set always exists but if the ambient space is non-compact the
situation changes dramatically. The subsequent sections will be devoted to establish the sharp
regularity for the optimal sets.

5.1. Notation. Let (M n, g) be a complete Riemannian manifold and denote by dg the geodesic
distance, by µg the measure associated to the Riemannian volume form and by X(M ) the smooth
vector ﬁelds. Given a measurable subset E ⊂ M , the perimeter of E is denoted by P(E) and is
given by the following formula

P(E) := sup(cid:26)ZE

divX dµg : X ∈ X(M ), spt(X) ⊂⊂ M, kXkL∞(M,g) ≤ 1(cid:27) ,

and, for any open subset Ω ⊂ M , we write P(E, Ω) when the ﬁelds X are restricted to have compact
support in Ω. It is out of the scope of this paper to discuss the theory of ﬁnite perimeter sets;
standard references are [3], [20] and [37].

Since from now on we will work with sets of ﬁnite perimeter, which are well deﬁned up to subsets
of measure zero, we will adopt the following deﬁnition of extrinsic radius of a measurable subset
E ⊂ M :

rad(E) := inf {r > 0 : µg(E \ Br(z0)) = 0 for some z0 ∈ M } ,

where Br(z0) denotes the open metric ball with center z0 and radius r > 0. A metric ball Br(z0)
satisfying µg(E \ Br(z0)) = 0, is called an enclosing ball for E.

We consider the following minimization problem: for every ﬁxed V ∈ (0, µg(M )),

min n rad(E) P(E) : E ⊂ M, µg(E) = Vo,

(5.1)

14

ANDREA MONDINO AND EMANUELE SPADARO

and call the minimizers of (5.1) isoperimetric-isodiametric sets (or regions).

5.2. Existence of isoperimetric-isodiametric regions in compact manifolds. Let us start
with the following lemma, stating the lower semi continuity of the extrinsic radius under L1
loc
convergence.

Lemma 5.1 (Lower semi-continuity of extrinsic radius under L1
loc convergence). Let (M, g) be a
(non necessarily compact) Riemannian manifold and let (Ek)k∈N∪{∞} be a sequence of measurable
subsets such that χEk → χE∞ in L1

loc(M, µg). Then

rad(E∞) ≤ lim inf

k∈N

rad(Ek).

Proof. Without loss of generality we can assume lim inf k∈N rad(Ek) < ∞ so, up to selecting a subse-
quence, we can assume χEk → χE∞ a.e. and limk↑+∞ rad(Ek) = ℓ < ∞. Let Bk := Brad(Ek)(xk) be
enclosing balls for Ek. Then two cases can occur. Either xk is unbounded, i.e. supk dg(xk, ¯x) = ∞
for any ¯x ∈ M , in which case it follows that E∞ = ∅ and the conclusion of the lemma is proved.
Or there exists x∞ ∈ M such that, up to passing to a subsequence, xk → x∞. In this case it is
readily veriﬁed that

from which it follows, by taking the limit as k → +∞, that µg(cid:0)E∞ \ Bℓ(x∞)(cid:1) = 0, which by

deﬁnition implies that rad(E∞) ≤ ℓ.

µg(cid:0)Ek \ Brad(Ek)+|xk−x∞|(x∞)(cid:1) = 0

(cid:3)

The next theorem is a general existence result for minimizers of the problem (5.1), as special cases it
will be applied in Corollary 5.3 to compact manifolds and in Theorem 5.5 for asymptotically locally
Euclidean manifolds (ALE for short) having non-negative Ricci curvature. Let us observe that the
existence of a minimizer in a non-compact manifold for the classical isoperimetric problem is much
harder due to the possibility of “small tentacles” going to inﬁnity in a minimizing sequence; this
diﬃculty is simply not there in the isoperimetric-isoperimetric problem we are considering, since it
would imply the radius to go to inﬁnity. We believe that this simpliﬁcation, together with sharp
inequalities obtained in the previous section, is another motivation to look at the isoperimetric-
isoperimetric inequality since it appears more manageable in many situations than the classical
isoperimetric one.

Theorem 5.2 (Suﬃcient conditions for existence of isoperimetric-isodiametric regions). Let (M n, g)
be a possibly non compact Riemannian n-manifold satisfying the following two conditions:

(1) lim inf r→0+ supx∈M µg(Br(x)) = 0.
(2) There exists ε0 > 0 and a function

ΦIsop : [0, ε0) → R+ with limt↓0ΦIsop(t) = 0,

such that for every ﬁnite perimeter set E ⊂ M with P(E) < ε0 the weak isoperimetric
inequality µg(E) ≤ ΦIsop(P(E)) holds.

Let V ∈ (0, µg(M )) be ﬁxed and let (Ek)k∈N ⊂ M be a sequence of ﬁnite perimeter sets satisfying

µg(Ek) = V, ∀k ∈ N, and sup

k∈N(cid:16) rad(Ek) P(Ek)(cid:17) < ∞.

(5.2)

ON A ISOPERIMETRIC-ISODIAMETRIC INEQUALITY

15

Then there exist R > 0 and a sequence (xk)k∈N of points in M such that µg(Ek \ BR(xk)) = 0, i.e.
BR(xk) are inclosing balls for Ek.

In particular, if there exists a minimizing sequence (Ek)k∈N for the problem (5.1) relative to some
ﬁxed V ∈ (0, µg(M )) such that µg(Ek ∩ K) > 0 for inﬁnitely many k and a ﬁxed compact subset
K ⊂ M , then there exists an isoperimetric-isodiametric region of volume V .

Proof. We start the proof by the following two claims.

Claim 1: inf k rad(Ek) > 0.

Otherwise, up subsequences in k, there exist rk ↓ 0 and xk ∈ M such that µg(Ek \ Brk (xk)) = 0.
But then the assumption (1) implies µg(Ek) ≤ µg(Brk (xk)) = 0, contradicting (5.2).

Claim 2: inf k P(Ek) > 0.

Otherwise, by the assumption (2) we get µg(Ek) ≤ ΦIsop(P(Ek)) → 0, contradicting again (5.2).

Combining the two claims with (5.2), we infer that there exists C > 1 such that

1
C

≤ P(Ek) ≤ C and

1
C

≤ rad(Ek) ≤ C,

(5.3)

so that the ﬁrst part of the proposition is proved.
If now there exists a compact subset K ⊂ M such that µg(Ek ∩ K) > 0 for inﬁnitely many k then
by (5.3), up to enlarging K and selecting a subsequence in k, we can assume µg(Ek \ K) = 0. But
then the characteristic functions (χEk )k∈N are pre-compact in L1(K, µg) since the total variations
of χEk are equi-bounded by (5.3) (cf. [3, Theorem 3.23]). The thesis then follows by the lower
semicontinuity of the perimeter under L1
loc convergence (cf. [3, Proposition 3.38]) combined with
Lemma 5.1.
(cid:3)

Clearly if the manifold is compact all the assumptions of Theorem 5.2 are satisﬁed and we can

state the following corollary.

Corollary 5.3 (Existence of isoperimetric-isodiametric regions in compact manifolds). Let (M n, g)
be a compact Riemannian manifold. Then for every V ∈ (0, µg(M )) there exists a minimizer of the
problem (5.1), in other words there exists an isoperimetric-isodiametric region of volume V .

5.3. Existence of isoperimetric-isodiametric regions in non-compact ALE spaces with
non-negative Ricci curvature. Let us start by recalling the notion of pointed C 0-convergence
of metrics.

Deﬁnition 5.4. Let (M n, g) be a smooth complete Riemannian manifold and ﬁx ¯x ∈ M . A sequence
of pointed smooth complete Riemannian n-manifolds (Mk, gk, xk) is said to converge in the pointed
C 0-topology to the manifold (M, g, ¯x), and we write (Mk, gk, xk) → (M, g, ¯x), if for every R > 0
we can ﬁnd a domain ΩR with BR(¯x) ⊆ ΩR ⊆ M , a natural number NR ∈ N, and C 1-embeddings
Fk,R : ΩR → Mk for large k ≥ NR such that BR(xk) ⊆ Fk,R(ΩR) and F ∗
k,R(gk) → g on ΩR in the
C 0-topology.

Theorem 5.5. Let (M, g) be a complete Riemannian n-manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature
and ﬁx any reference point ¯x ∈ M . Assume that for any diverging sequence of points (xk)k∈N ⊂ M ,
i.e. d(xk, ¯x) → ∞, the sequence of pointed manifolds (M, g, xk) converges in the pointed C 0-topology

16

ANDREA MONDINO AND EMANUELE SPADARO

to the Euclidean space (Rn, gRn , 0).
Then for every V ∈ [0, µg(M )) there exists a minimizer of the problem (5.1), in other words there
exists an isoperimetric-isodiametric region of volume V .

Proof. Since volume and perimeter involve only the metric tensor g and not its derivatives, the
hypothesis on the manifold (M, g) of being C 0-locally asymptotic to Rn implies directly that as-
sumptions (1) and (2) of Theorem 5.2 are satisﬁed. Therefore the thesis will be a consequence of
Theorem 5.2 once we show the following: given Ek ⊂ M a minimizing sequence of the problem
(5.1) for some ﬁxed volume V ∈ [0, µg(M )), then there exists a compact subset K ⊂ M such that
µg(Ek ∩ K) > 0 for inﬁnitely many k. We will show that if this last statement is violated then
(M, g) is ﬂat and minimizers are metric balls of volume V .

By the ﬁrst part of Theorem 5.2 we know that there exist R > 0 and a sequence (xk)k∈N of

points in M such that µg(Ek \ BR(xk)) = 0, i.e. BR(xk) are inclosing balls for Ek.
Fixed any reference point ¯x ∈ M , if lim inf k d(xk, ¯x) then clearly we can ﬁnd a compact subset
K ⊂ M such that µg(Ek ∩ K) > 0 for inﬁnitely many k and the conclusion follows from the
last part of Theorem 5.2. So assume that d(¯x, xk) → ∞. Since M is C 0-locally asymptotic to Rn,
combining Deﬁnition 5.4 with the Euclidean isoperimetric-isodiametric inequality (2.3), we get that

But since (M, g) has non-negative Ricci curvature, the comparison estimate (4.2) yields that

lim inf
k→∞

rad(Ek) P(Ek) ≥ n V.

(5.4)

lim
k→∞

rad(Ek) P(Ek) = inf{rad(Ω)P(Ω) : Ω ⊂ M, Vol(Ω) = V } ≤ nV.

(5.5)

The combination of (5.4) with (5.5) clearly implies

inf{rad(Ω)P(Ω) : Ω ⊂ M, Vol(Ω) = V } = nV.

The rigidity statement of Theorem 4.1 then gives that any metric ball in (M, g) of volume V is
isometric to a round ball in Rn, and therefore in particular is a minimizer of the problem (5.1). (cid:3)

5.4. Examples of non-compact spaces where existence of isoperimetric-isodiametric
regions fails.

Example 5.6 (Mimimal surfaces with planar ends). If M ⊂ R3 is an helicoid, or more generally a
minimal surface with planar ends, then it is in particular C 0-locally asymptotic to R2 in the sense
of Deﬁnition 5.4. Then, if we consider a sequence of metric balls Brk (xk) ⊂ M of ﬁxed volume
V > 0 such that xk → ∞ we get limk→∞ rad(Brk (xk)) Vol(Brk (xk)) = 2 V . In particular, for every
V > 0 we have

inf{rad(Ω)P(Ω) : Ω ⊂ M, Vol(Ω) = V } ≤ 2V.

But then Proposition 3.7 implies that the inﬁmum is never achieved, or more precisely it is achieved
if and only if M is an aﬃne subspace.
The same argument holds for any minimal n-dimensional sub-manifold in Rm with ends which are
C 0-locally asymptotic to Rn.
(cid:3)

ON A ISOPERIMETRIC-ISODIAMETRIC INEQUALITY

Example 5.7 (ALE spaces of negative sectional curvature). Let (M n, g) be a simply connected
non-compact Riemannian manifold with negative sectional curvature and assume that (M, g) is C 0-
locally asymptotic to Rn in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.4. Then, if we consider a sequence of metric balls
Brk (xk) ⊂ M of ﬁxed volume V > 0 such that xk → ∞ we get limk→∞ rad(Brk (xk)) Vol(Brk (xk)) =
n V . In particular, for every V > 0 we have

inf{rad(Ω)P(Ω) : Ω ⊂ M, Vol(Ω) = V } ≤ nV.

But then Proposition 3.1 implies that the inﬁmum is never achieved, or more precisely it is achieved
by a region Ω if and only if Ω is isometric to a Euclidean region, which is forbidden since M has
negative sectional curvature.
(cid:3)

6. Optimal regularity of isoperimetric-isodiametric regions

In this last section we establish the optimal regularity for the isoperimetric-isodiametric regions,

i.e. the minimizers of problem (5.1), under the assumption that the enclosing ball is regular.

6.1. C 1, 1

2 regularity.

6.1.1. First properties. Let E be a minimizer of the isoperimetric–isodiametric problem in (M, g)
with volume µg(E) = V > 0. Let x0 ∈ M satisfy µg(E \ Brad(E)(x0)) = 0 and, for the sake of
simplicity, we ﬁx the notation B := Brad(E)(x0) for an enclosing ball. In the sequel, we always
assume that B has regular boundary and we assume to be in the non-trivial case µg(B \ E) > 0.

By the very deﬁnition of isoperimetric-isodiametric sets, we have that

P(E) ≤ P(F ) ∀ F △E ⊂⊂ B : µg(F ) = V.

(6.1)

In particular, E is a minimizer of the perimeter with constrained volume in B, and therefore we
can apply the classical regularity results (see, for example, [40, Corollary 3.8]) in order to deduce
that there exists a relatively closed set Sing(E) ⊂ B such that dimH(Sing(E)) ≤ n − 8 and
∂E ∩ B \ Sing(E) is a smooth (n − 1)-dimensional hypersurface.

Moreover, by the ﬁrst variations of the area functional under volume constraint, one deduces
that the mean curvature is constant on the regular part of the boundary: i.e. there exits H0 ∈ R
such that

~HE(x) = H0 νE ∀ x ∈ ∂E ∩ B \ Sing(E),

(6.2)

where

n−1

~HE(x) :=

∇τiτi,

Xi=1

for {τ1, . . . , τn−1} a local orthonormal frame of ∂E around x ∈ ∂E ∩ B \ Sing(E), νE the interior
normal to E and ∇ the Riemannian connection on (M, g).

In this section we prove the following.

Proposition 6.1. Let E ⊂ M be an isoperimetric-isodiametric set and x0 ∈ M be such that
µg(E \ Brad(E)(x0)) = 0. Assume that B := Brad(E)(x0)) has smooth boundary. Then, there exists
δ > 0 such that ∂E \ Brad(E)−δ(x0) is C 1, 1

2 regular.

18

ANDREA MONDINO AND EMANUELE SPADARO

Remark 6.2. In particular, given the partial regularity in B as explained in § 6.1.1, we conclude
that E is a closed set whose boundary is C 1, 1
2 regular except at most a closed singular set Sing(E)
of dimension less or equal to n − 8.
(cid:3)

6.1.2. Almost minimizing property. The main ingredient of the proof of Proposition 6.1 is the
following almost-minimizing property.

Lemma 6.3. Let E be an isoperimetric-isodiametric set in M and let B denote an enclosing ball
as above. There exist constants C, r0 > 0 such that, for every x ∈ B and for every 0 < r < r0, the
following holds

P(E) ≤ P(F ) + C rn ∀ F △E ⊂⊂ Br(x).

Remark 6.4. Note that Br(x) is not necessarily contained in B.

(6.3)

(cid:3)

Proof. We start ﬁxing parameters η, c1 > 0 and two points y1, y2 ∈ B such that dg(y1, y2) > 4 η,
B4η(y1) ⊂ B, B4η(y2) ⊂ B and

P(E, Bη(yi)) > c1

i = 1, 2.

(6.4)

Note that the possibility of such a choice is easily deduced from the regularity of the previous
subsection, or more elementary from the density estimates for sets of ﬁnite perimeter in points
of the reduced boundary. Set for simplicity of notation Di := Bη(yi). By a result by Giusti [26,
Lemma 2.1], there exist v0, C1 > 0 such that, for every v ∈ R with |v| < v0 and for every i = 1, 2,
there exists Fi which satisﬁes the following

(6.5)

Fi△E ⊂ Di,
µg(Fi) = µg(E) + v,
P(Fi) ≤ P(E) + C1 v.

Note that in [26, Lemma 2.1] the property (6.5) is proven in the Euclidean space with the ﬂat
metric, but the proof remains unchanged in a Riemannian manifold (up to a suitable choice of the
constants v0, C1).

Next, let r0 > 0 be a constant to be ﬁxed momentarily such that r0 < η and

µg(Br(x)) ≤ C2 rn < v0,

∀r ∈ [0, r0]

sup
x∈B

(6.6)

for some C2 > 0 depending just on B and r0. Since dg(y1, y2) > 4 η, for every x ∈ B, Br0(x) cannot
intersect both D1 and D2: therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume Br0(x) ∩ D1 = ∅.
If r < r0 and F ⊂ M is any set such that F △E ⊂⊂ Br(x), we consider F ′ := F ∩ B. Note that
F ′ ⊂ B and moreover

|µg(F ′) − µg(E)| ≤ µg(Br(x)) ≤ C2 rn < v0.

According to (6.5) we can then ﬁnd F ′′ ⊂ B such that µg(F ′′) = µg(E), F ′′△F ′ ⊂⊂ D1 and

P(F ′′) ≤ P(F ′) + C1|µg(F ′) − µg(E)|.

(6.7)

ON A ISOPERIMETRIC-ISODIAMETRIC INEQUALITY

Using the fact that E minimizes the perimeter among compactly supported perturbation in ¯B, we
deduce that

P(E) ≤ P(F ′′)

(6.7)
≤ P(F ′) + C1|µg(F ′) − µg(E)|

≤ P(F ) + P(B) − P(F ∪ B) + C2 rn.

(6.8)

Next note that, if ∂B is C 1,1 regular, then one can choose r0 > 0 such that the following holds:
there exists a constant C3 > 0 such that, for every x ∈ B and for every r ∈ (0, r0),

P(B) ≤ P(G) + C3 rn ∀ G△B ⊂⊂ Br(x).

(6.9)

In order to show this claim, it it enough to take r0 small enough (in particular smaller than half
the injectivity radius) in such a way that, for every p ∈ ∂B, there exists a co-ordinate chart
φ : B2r0(p) → Rn such that φ(∂B) ⊂ {xn = 0} and φ is a C 1,1 diﬀeomorphism with dφ(p) ∈
SO(n), φ(p) = 0 and g(0) = Id, g being the metric tensor in the coordinates induced by φ . Indeed,
in this case we have that P(B, Br(p)) ≤ (1 + Cr)ωn−1rn−1 for every r < r0 and, for every G such
that G△B ⊂⊂ Br(p),

P(G, Br(p)) ≥ (1 − Cr)P(proj(φ(G)), φ(Br (p))) ≥ (1 − Cr)ωn−1rn−1,

where proj denotes the orthogonal Euclidean projection on {xn = 0} and we have used the regularity
of φ.

Applying (6.9) to G = F ∪ B and using (6.8), we conclude the proof.

(cid:3)

6.1.3. Proof of Proposition 6.1. Now we are in the position to apply a result by Tamanini [47,
Theorem 1] (the result is proved in Rn with a ﬂat metric, but the proof is unchanged in a Riemannian
manifold) in order to give a proof of the above proposition.

To this aim, we start considering any point p ∈ ∂B ∩ ∂E; we denote with Expp : TpM → M the
exponential map and we let r0 > 0 be less then the injectivity radius. Since by Lemma 6.3 the set
E is an almost minimizer of the perimeter, the rescaled sets

Ep,r :=

Exp−1

p (E ∩ Br0(p))

r

⊂ TpM ≃ Rn

(6.10)

converge up to passing to a suitable subsequence to a minimizing cone C∞ in the Euclidean space
(see [37, Theorem 28.6]). Moreover, since E is enclosed by B and ∂B is C 1,1, it is immediate
to check that if r0 > 0 is chosen small enough in (6.10), then C∞ ⊂ {x : g(νB(p), x) ≥ 0}, we
deduce that every tangent cone to E at p needs to be contained in a half-space, and therefore by
the Bernstein theorem is ﬂat (cf. [25, Theorem 17.4]). This implies that every such point p is a
point of the reduced boundary of the set (see [3, Deﬁnition 3.54]) and therefore we can apply the
aforementioned result by Tamanini to conclude that ∂E is a C 1, 1
2 regular hypersurface in Br(p) for
every p ∈ ∂B ∩ ∂E and for every r < r0
2 . By a simple covering argument, the conclusion of the
corollary follows.

6.2. L∞ estimates on the mean curvature of the minimizer. In this section we prove that
the boundary of E has generalized mean curvature in the sense of varifolds which is bounded in L∞.
To this aim, we compute the ﬁrst variations of the perimeter of E along suitable diﬀeomorphisms.

6.2.1. First variations. We start ﬁxing two points y1, y2 ∈ ∂E ∩ B \ Sing(E) and a real number
η > 0 such that B4η(y1) ⊂ B, B4η(y2) ⊂ B and

B4η(y1) ∩ B4η(y2) = B4η(y1) ∩ Sing(E) = B4η(y2) ∩ Sing(E) = ∅.

Note that such a choice is possible in the hypothesis that µg(B \ E) > 0 because of the partial
regularity in § 6.1.1. Let X ∈ X(M ) be a vector ﬁeld with support contained in a metric ball Bη(y)
for some y ∈ M . Clearly, Bη(y) cannot intersect both B2η(y1) and B2η(y2), because dg(y1, y2) ≥ 8η;
therefore, without loss of generality let us assume that Bη(y) ∩ B2η(y1) = ∅. It is not diﬃcult to
construct a smooth vector ﬁeld Y supported in Bη(y1) such that the generated ﬂow {ΦY
t } satisﬁes
the following properties for small |t|:

µg(ΦY

t ◦ ΦX

t (E)) = µg(E).

(6.11)

Note that the generated ﬂows {ΦX
are diﬀeomorphisms of M . Moreover, ΦY

t }t∈R and {ΦY

t ◦ ΦX

t }t∈R are well-deﬁned and for |t| suﬃciently small

t (E) ⊂ Brad(E)+|t|kXk∞ . We can then deduce that

to singular set of dimension at most n − 8 and that Y is supported in Bη(y) where ∂E is smooth
in order to make the integration by parts.) In the case V ∈ (0, µg(M )), we have rad(E) > 0 and

for some C = C(rad(E), P(E), |H0|) > 0, for every vector ﬁeld X with support contained in a
metric ball Bη(y) for some y ∈ M . By a simple partition of unity argument, (6.16) holds for every
X ∈ X(M ). In particular, by the use of Riesz representation theorem we have proved the following
lemma. To this regard we denote with M(M, T M ) the vectorial Radon measures ~µ on M with
values in the tangent bundle T M .

Lemma 6.5 (The mean curvature is represented by a vectorial Radon measure). Let E ⊂ M be
an isoperimetric-isodiametric region for some V ∈ (0, µg(M )) and denote by B an enclosing ball.
If ∂B is smooth, then there exists a vectorial radon measure ~HE ∈ M(M, T M ) concentrated on
∂E such that for every C 1 vector ﬁeld X on M with compact support, called ΦX
: M → M the
t
corresponding one-parameter family of diﬀeomorphisms for t ∈ R, it holds

δE(X) :=

Moreover the total variation of ~HE is ﬁnite, i.e.

which in view of (6.17) gives

g(cid:0)νB, ~HE(cid:1)x(∂E ∩ ∂B) ≤ H0 Hn−1x(∂E ∩ ∂B),

(6.22)

where the inequality is intended in the sense of measures, i.e.RA g(νB, ~HE) ≤ H0Hn−1(A) for every

measurable set A ⊂ ∂E ∩ ∂B.

6.2.2. Orthogonality of ~HE. We have seen in the previous section that ~HE is well-deﬁned as a
measure on all ∂E. Translated into the language of varifolds, we have shown that the integral
varifold associated to ∂E has ﬁnite ﬁrst variation. A classical result due to Brakke [7, Section 5.8]
(see also [38] for an alternative proof and for ﬁne structural properties of varifolds with locally
ﬁnite ﬁrst variation) implies that for Hn−1-a.e. x ∈ ∂E it holds ~HE(x) ∈ (Tx∂E)⊥. This is not
quite enough to our purposes, indeed in the next lemma we will show that ~HE is normal to ∂E as
measure, which is a strictly stronger statement. Note that the proof is based on the fact that E is
a minimizer for the problem (5.1), and will not make use of the aforementioned structural result
by Brakke.

Lemma 6.7 (The mean curvature measure is orthogonal to ∂E). Let E, B, M, V, ~HE be as in
Lemma 6.5. Then ~HE(x) ∈ (Tx∂E)⊥ for | ~HE|-a.e. x ∈ ∂E, i.e. the mean curvature is orthogonal
to ∂E as a measure.

Remark 6.8. In other words there exists an R-valued ﬁnite radon measure HE on M concentrated
on ∂E such that ~HE = HE νE; moreover, by (6.2), HE x(B ∩ ∂E) = H0 Hn−1x(∂E ∩ B).

Proof. In view of (6.2) we only need to prove the claim for ~HE x∂B. Assume by contradiction that
there exists a compact subset K ⊂ ∂B ∩ ∂E such that

| ~HT

E|(K) > 0,

(6.23)

where ~HT
onto T ∂B, because ∂E and ∂B are C 1 and Tx∂E = Tx∂B for every x ∈ ∂B ∩ ∂E).

E := PT ∂E( ~HE) is the projection of ~HE onto the tangent space of ∂E (or, equivalently,

The geometric idea of the proof is very neat: if the mean curvature along K ⊂ ∂E ∩ ∂B has a
non trivial tangential part, then deforming inﬁnitesimally E along this tangential direction will not
increase the extrinsic radius (since the deformation of E will stay in the ball B), will not increase
the volume (because the deformation is tangential to ∂E) but will strictly decrease the perimeter;
so, after adjusting the volume in a smooth portion of ∂E, this procedure builds an inﬁnitesimal
deformation of E which preserves the volume, does not increase the extrinsic radius but strictly
decreases the perimeter, contradicting that E is a minimizer of the problem (5.1). The rest of the
proof is a technical implementation of this neat geometric idea.

For every ε > 0 we construct a suitable C 1 regular tangential vector ﬁeld. To this aim, we
consider the polar decomposition of the measure ~HT
E| where v is a Borel vector ﬁeld such
that v(x) ∈ T ∂B and g(v(x), v(x)) = 1 for | ~HT
E|-a.e. x ∈ M . By the Lusin theorem we can ﬁnd
a continuous vector ﬁeld w such that | ~HT
E|({v 6= w}) ≤ ε and spt(w) ⊂ Kε := {x ∈ ∂E ∩ ∂B :
dg(x, K) < ε}. Moreover, by a standard regularization procedure via molliﬁcation and projection

E = v | ~HT

ON A ISOPERIMETRIC-ISODIAMETRIC INEQUALITY

23

on T ∂B, we ﬁnd a vector ﬁeld Xε such that Xε(x) ∈ T ∂B for every x ∈ ∂B ∩ K2ε, kXε − wk∞ ≤ ε
and spt(Xε) ⊂ K2ε. Note that

Up to choosing a smaller compact set, we can suppose that K is contained in a small ball Br0(x)
with x ∈ ∂E ∩∂B such that (∂E \∂B)∩(M \B4r0 (x)) 6= ∅. Now ﬁx y ∈ ∂E \(∂B∪B4r0 (x)∪Sing(E))
and let r ∈ (0, r0) be such that B2r(y) ∩ (∂B ∪ B4r0(x) ∪ Sing(E)) = ∅. For ε > 0 small enough it is
not diﬃcult to construct a smooth vector ﬁeld Yε supported in Br(y) such that the generated ﬂow

Clearly the last inequality contradicts (6.30). We conclude that it is not possible to ﬁnd a compact

E| vanishes identically and the
proof is complete.

6.2.3. L∞ estimate. The next step is to show that the signed measure HE is actually absolutely
continuous with respect to Hn−1x∂E with L∞ bounds on the density. The upper bound follows
from (6.22). For the lower bound we use the following lemma which is an adaptation of [49,
Theorem 2] to our setting (notice that the statement of [49, Theorem 2] is more general as includes
higher co-dimensions and arbitrary varifolds, but let us state below just the result we will use in
the sequel).

Lemma 6.9. Let N n ⊂ M n be an n-dimensional submanifold with C 2-boundary ∂N and denote
with νN the inward pointing unit normal to ∂N . Fix a compact subset K ⊂ ∂N and assume that,
denoted with ~HN the mean curvature of ∂N , it holds

Lemma 6.9 will be used to prove the following lower bound on the mean curvature measure HE

of ∂E.

Lemma 6.10 (Lower bound on HE). Let E, B, M, V, ~HE , HE be as in Lemma 6.7. Assume η :=
inf ∂B HB > −∞, where HB := g( ~HB, νB) and ~HB is the mean curvature vector of ∂B. Then

HE x(∂E ∩ ∂B) ≥ η Hn−1x(∂E ∩ ∂B).

(6.36)

Proof. Fix any K ⊂ ∂E ∩ ∂B. For every ε ∈ (0, 1) let Xε be the C 1 vector ﬁeld obtained by
applying Lemma 6.9 with N = B, then by (6.35) and (6.33) we get

In particular, in the limit as ε → 0 we deduce from (6.37) that

6.3. Optimal regularity. In this section we prove that the boundary of an isoperimetric-isodiametric
set E is C 1,1 regular away from the singular set.

Theorem 6.11. Let E ⊂ M be an isoperimetric-isodiametric set and x0 ∈ M be such that µg(E \
Brad(E)(x0)) = 0. Assume that B := Brad(E)(x0)) has smooth boundary. Then, there exists δ > 0
such that ∂E \ Brad(E)−δ(x0) is C 1,1 regular.

Note that the C 1,1 regularity is optimal, because in general one cannot expect to have continuity
of the second fundamental form of ∂E across the free boundary of ∂E, i.e. the points on the relative
(with respect to ∂B) boundary of ∂E ∩ ∂B.

6.3.1. Co-ordinate charts. We start ﬁxing suitable co-ordinate charts. Since E is bounded, there
exists r0 > 0 such that for every x0 ∈ ∂E there is a normal co-ordinate chart (Ω, ϕ) with x0 ∈ Ω
and

ϕ : Ω ⊂ M → Bn−1

r0 × (−r0, r0) ⊂ Rn−1 × R

such that ϕ(x0) = 0, g(0) = Id and ∇g(0) = 0, where g denotes the metric tensor in these
co-ordinates. Moreover, by the C 1, 1
2 regularity of ∂E established in § 6.1, up to rotating these co-
ordinate chart and eventually changing r0, we can also assume that for every point x0 ∈ ∂B ∩ ∂E
also the following holds:

• ∂E and ∂B are, respectively, C 1, 1

2 and C ∞ regular submanifolds, given in this chart as

graphs of functions u, ψ : Bn−1

• the functions u and ψ satisfy ψ(x) ≤ u(x) for every x ∈ Bn−1

Proposition 6.12. Let E ⊂ M be an isoperimetric-isodiametric set. Then, there exists a constant
C > 0 such that, for every x0 ∈ ∂E ∩ ∂B, setting co-ordinates as in § 6.3.1, we have that

u(x) − ψ(x) ≤ C |x|2 ∀ x ∈ Bn−1

(6.50)

Proof. Let us consider the homogeneous part of the operator L, i.e. Lw := cij∂ijw. Since L(u−ψ) =
Lu − Lψ − d, for every r ≤ r0 we can write (u − ψ)|Bn−1

= w1 + w2 with

We start estimating w2 from below. Considering that Lw2 + Lψ + d = Lu ≤ 0, we can apply
the L∞-estimate for elliptic equations [24, Theorem 8.16]. In order to understand the dependence
of the constant on the domain, we can rescale the variables in this way: v : Bn−1
1 → R given by
v(y) := r−2w2(r y). Then, the equation satisﬁed by v is

We can then conclude using [24, (8.39)] that

Lv(y) + Lψ(ry) + d(ry) = Lu(ry) ≤ 0.

where now C is a dimensional constant (only depending on q > n − 1, which for us is any ﬁxed
exponent – note that the hypothesis (8.8) in [24, Theorem 8.16] is satisﬁed because we are consid-
ering the operator L which has no lower order terms). In particular, scaling back to w2 we deduce
that

(6.53)
This clearly implies that w1(0) = u(0)−ψ(0)−w2(0) ≤ C r2. We can then use Harnack inequality

Finally note that in Bn−1

z := w2 + C |x|2 satisﬁes Lz ≥ 0 for a suitably chosen constant C = C(kLψkL∞ , kdkL∞ ). By the

conclude the proof of the proposition.

if
dist(p, ∂E ∩ ∂B) = dist(p, x0) < s0, then p belongs to the co-ordinate chart Ω around x0 as ﬁxed
in § 6.3.1 and moreover, in these co-ordinates, p = (x, z) ∈ Bn−1

Lemma 6.13. Let p ∈ ∂E \ ∂B satisfy dist(p, ∂E ∩ ∂B) < s0. Fixing x0 ∈ ∂E ∩ ∂B and the

Proof. Since on Bn−1

of the basic interior Schauder estimates for second order elliptic equations (cp. [24, Theorem 6.2]).
More precisely we write the equation as Lu = −d where d ∈ C 0,α was deﬁned is (6.47) and satisﬁes
(6.49), and we apply [24, Theorem 6.2]) to such an equation.

6.3.5. C 1,1-regularity. In this section we ﬁnally prove Theorem 6.11. The proof is based on the
following property: by Proposition 6.12 and Lemma 6.13, there exists δ > 0 such that for every
x0 ∈ ∂B ∩ ∂E there exists r0 > 0 satisfying the following: ﬁxing co-ordinates as in § 6.3.1,

|u(y) − u(x) − ∇u(x) · (y − x)| ≤

¯C
2

|x − y|2,

∀ x, y ∈ Br0(x0).

(6.56)

Indeed, if x ∈ ∂E ∩ ∂B, then centering the co-ordinates at x we have 0 = u(0) = |∇u(0)|, and (6.56)
is a direct consequence of (6.50). On the other hand, if x /∈ ∂E ∩ ∂B, then setting the co-ordinates
as in Lemma 6.13, we deduce (6.56) from (6.55).

The conclusion of Theorem 6.11 is then a direct consequence of the following lemma combined

with a standard partition of unity argument.

6.4. Further comments. We have proven the above regularity of the isoperimetric-isodiametric
sets E ⊂ M under the assumptions that the enclosing ball B = Brad(E)(x0) has smooth boundary.
Actually, the following is true and is a direct consequence of the argument used above.

(A) If ∂B ∈ C 1,α for some α ∈ (0, 1], then in a neighbourhood of ∂B the isoperimetric-

isodiametric sets have the boundary ∂E which are C 1,α regular.

Indeed, under the assumption in (A), the arguments in Lemma 6.3 show that ∂E is C 1,κ regular
in a neighbourhood of ∂B for k = min{α, 1
2 }. Moreover, a careful inspection of the proof of the
optimal regularity in Theorem 6.11 shows that the conclusion of (A) holds true with the right
H¨older exponent (in the case α = 1 the proof is a straightforward generalization; for α ∈ ( 1
2 , 1)
more details need to be checked). Nevertheless, we do not do it here.
