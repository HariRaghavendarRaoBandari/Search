To exploit a given physical system for quantum information processing, it is critical to understand the different
types of noise affecting quantum control. The ability to distinguish coherent and incoherent error is extremely
useful, as these errors contribute differently to the fault tolerance threshold, but coherent error is generally
easier to reduce at the hardware level. In this work, we characterize the quantum control of a single (ensemble)
qubit via solid-state pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR). We use randomized benchmarking (RB) together
with purity benchmarking (PB) to quantify the total error and the incoherent error in a set of Clifford gates.
The lowest error rates are achieved when the transfer function of the pulsed ESR control system is carefully
accounted for, and we ﬁnd that incoherent errors make up the majority of the total error. The robustness of
RB to gate-dependent noise is investigated by using gate-set tomography and numerical simulations, where it is
found that RB and PB are surprisingly robust.

Introduction– A key obstacle in realizing scalable quantum
information processing (QIP) is how to implement quantum
gates with an error rate below the threshold given by quan-
tum error correction (QEC) theory [1–6], so that quantum er-
ror correction is effective. As the errors with different noise
mechanisms are corrected for in different ways and have dif-
ferent impacts on QIP, understanding the noise characteristics
in quantum systems is of critical importance.

Noise characteristics are broadly grouped as either coherent
(unitary) or incoherent. In this work, incoherent noise refers
to the type of noise that cannot be represented by a unitary
operator, such as T1 and T2 processes. Coherent noise is usu-
ally associated with systematic control errors in, for example,
imperfect rotating angles or axes [7, 8], which are believed to
be easier to reduce than incoherent noise. Therefore, knowing
the dominant noise characteristics can help experimentalists
to improve quantum control accordingly in a realistic system.
Coherent noise accumulates quadratically with the number of
gates, whereas incoherent noise accumulates linearly. Hence,
coherent noise generally results in a larger error as the length
of the computation increases. Furthermore, coherent and in-
coherent errors with the same average gate error

(E) = 1 −(cid:90) dψ (cid:104)ψ|E(|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ|)|ψ(cid:105),

(1)

where E is the noise channel and the integral is over all
pure states ψ according to the Fubini-Study metric, may lead
to dramatically different thresholds (typically related to the
worst-case error [9]). Therefore, knowing whether the domi-
nant noise characteristics are coherent or incoherent is essen-
tial for determining an appropriate error threshold when eval-
uating a physical system.

Several distinct methods have been proposed to character-

ize quantum control. Protocols such as quantum process to-
mography (QPT) [10, 11], gate set tomography (GST) [12, 13]
and randomized benchmarking tomography (RBT) [14, 15]
give a complete characterization of a quantum process, of
which GST and RBT are independent of state preparation and
measurement (SPAM) errors. However, any complete charac-
terization of quantum control is inherently not scalable with
the system size. On the other hand, partial information about
the noise can be efﬁciently determined by averaging chan-
nels [16–24]. Randomized benchmarking (RB) [19–24] is
one such protocol, which enables the estimation of the av-
erage gate error and robustness to SPAM errors. Recently,
several approaches based on RB have been developed to pro-
vide more information of the noise in experiments than just
the average gate error [25–27].
In particular, purity bench-
marking (PB) [27] enables the quantiﬁcation of the coherence
of a noise process, which can be used to obtain an improved
threshold estimate [28, 29].

In this work, we turn the theory into experiment by measur-
ing the coherence of noise in the quantum control of a single
ensemble qubit, realized by a solid-state electron spin reso-
nance (ESR) system. The small-scale ESR systems explored
nowadays in the lab are good testbeds for improving the quan-
tum control techniques and testing the ideas of QEC. Electron
spins have a larger thermal polarization than nuclear spins,
and both electron spins and hyperﬁne coupled nuclear spins
can be efﬁciently controlled using ESR techniques [30–32].
Achieving high ﬁdelity quantum control in ESR is challeng-
ing due to the limited bandwidth of a conventional microwave
resonator. In this work, RB and PB protocols are used to as-
sess the control accuracy, and to go one step further by distin-
guishing between coherent and incoherent error. We take into
account the transfer function of the microwave resonator when

correcting numerically-derived optimal control (OC) pulses to
greatly reduce the gate error. Here we design OC pulses us-
ing a well-known gradient ascent technique [33]. We also use
a spin-packet selection technique to effectively reduce the in-
homogeneous spectral broadening [34] to study the effect of
a longer T ∗
2 on the gate error. By distinguishing the type of
noise (coherent versus incoherent), we gain better insight into
the nature of the remaining control imperfections and how to
address them. The lowest values we obtained for the aver-
age error probability (7.9 × 10−3) and the incoherent error
(6.0 × 10−3) for Clifford gates suggest that incoherent noise
is dominant source of noise in the remaining error of our con-
trols. The robustness of RB and PB to gate-dependent noise is
also investigated by comparing the results of the benchmark-
ing parotocols and GST.

Deﬁnition and measurement of the incoherent error– The
primary characteristic of a coherent noise process is that it
can be corrected by directly reversing the unitary process with
perfect control. We therefore deﬁne the incoherent error of a
noise channel E to be the optimal average gate error that can
be achieved by correcting E with perfect unitary operations,
that is,

in(E) = minU ,V (U ◦ E ◦ V)

(2)

for any unitary operations U and V. Note that in(E) is not a
linear function of E, so if the noise E is an average of noise
maps Ei (e.g., due to the ﬂuctuations in the magnetic ﬁeld),
further control optimizations can be achieved by correcting
each component Ei. For a general d-dimensional system, the
incoherent error satisﬁes

(E) ≥ in(E) ≥

d − 1

where u(E) is the unitarity of E deﬁned to be the purity of the

It can be shown that the the lower bound in Eq. (3) is essen-
tially saturated to O[in(E)2] for a single-qubit system (see
Supplementary Material), i.e.,

in(E) =

1

2(cid:16)1 −(cid:112)u(E)(cid:17) .

The average unitarity over a set of operations G forming a
unitary 2-design can be estimated via PB [27]. Therefore, the
average incoherent error can be estimated via PB. PB is simi-
lar to RB, having the same advantages (namely, efﬁciency and
robustness to SPAM) and holding under the same assumptions
(namely, that the noise is Markovian and only depends weakly
on the gate) [22, 24, 25]. For qubits, the speciﬁc form of PB
that maximizes the signal is as follows. (1) Prepare the state

2

σz. (2) Apply a sequence s of m uniformly-random opera-
tions from G, which maps σz → ρj. (3) Estimate the purity
(6)

Ps = (cid:104)σx(cid:105)2 + (cid:104)σy(cid:105)2 + (cid:104)σz(cid:105)2

of the ﬁnal state ρj. Averaging over random sequences of
length m and ﬁtting to

(cid:104)P(cid:105) = A + Bum−1,

(7)

where A and B absorb SPAM and the non-unitality of the
noise, allows the unitarity u to be estimated. Note that while
the protocol above is not directly scalable as estimating the
purity requires measuring an exponential number of Pauli ob-
servables, an efﬁcient protocol is outlined in Ref. [27].

Experimental Implementation– Our X-band pulsed ESR
spectrometer was custom-built for QIP including arbitrary
waveform generation capabilities and a loop-gap resonator for
sub-millimeter sized samples that allows for relatively broad-
band control [34]. We used a single-qubit sample of irradiated
quartz with T1 = 160 µs, T2 = 20 µs, and T ∗
2 = 55 ns. All
gates were implemented using OC pulses, in order to evaluate
the quality of microwave control with arbitrarily shaped wave-
forms. Such pulses are required for controlling nearby nuclear
spins via the anisotropic hyperﬁne interaction [30, 31].

A pulse generated with an initial waveform W(f ) in the
frequency-domain representation will be distorted to a new
(cid:48)(f ) seen by the spins, due to the resonator’s
waveform W
transfer function T [35, 36], and also possibly due to other
nonlinearities in the pulse generation and transmission. T is
the frequency-domain representation of the impulse response
(cid:48) = T · W where · denotes the point-
of the system, so that W
wise product of T and W. One method to correct this dis-
−1 · W, so
tortion is to prepare the initial waveform to be T
−1 · W = W. The
that the waveform at the spins is T · T
accuracy of this method is limited by the accuracy with which
the transfer function can be determined. We measured the
transfer function by detecting Rabi oscillations of the electron
spins as a function of the microwave frequency (see Supple-
mentary Material). This measured transfer function (denoted
as Tmeas) was then used to modify the input OC pulse so that
the distorted pulse seen by the spins would closely resemble
the ideal pulse.

We use ﬁve OC pulses, π/2 and π rotations around x- and
y- axes (denoted as X90, X180, Y90, and Y180 respectively)
and an identity operation (denoted as I). They are designed
to be robust to a distribution of static ﬁelds (T ∗
2 noise) and to
a distribution of microwave (B1) ﬁelds, where these distribu-
tions are chosen to mimic the properties of our sample and res-
onator. The design ﬁdelity of each pulse exceeds 99.2% when
averaged over these distributions (see Supplementary Mate-
rial). Each pulse is 150 ns long and contains 150 segments (1
ns per segment). Our results span three different experimental
conditions for implementing the OC pulses: (1) not taking the
resonator transfer function into account, i.e., assuming T = 1
for all frequencies, (2) modifying the input pulse using Tmeas,
and (3) the same as (2) but also implementing a spin-packet

selection state preparation sequence [34]. The selection se-
quence (SEL) in (3) effectively increases the T ∗
2 by a factor of
1.7.

The 24 elements of the Clifford group are implemented
as G = Z1SPZ2 where S ∈ {I, X90, Y90}, P ∈
{I, X180, Y180} and Z1,2 ∈ {I, Z90, Z180, Z270}. We
implement the operations in Z1,2 virtually by changing the
reference frame [37]. The initial state in all experiments is
represented by the deviation density matrix σz.

Figure 1(a) illustrates an RB experiment, where the recov-
ery gate R returns the ﬁnal state to ±σz in the absence of
noise. The measurement M in Fig. 1(a) is realized by a spin
echo detection sequence shown in Fig. 1(d) to measure the ex-
pectation value (cid:104)σz(cid:105). By removing the recovery gate, we get a
sequence used for a PB experiment, as shown in Fig. 1(b), to
measure the unitarity and thus the incoherent error by measur-
ing all three (cid:104)σz(cid:105), (cid:104)σx(cid:105), and (cid:104)σy(cid:105) (detection sequences shown
in Figs. 1(d) and (e)). We sample 78 random sequences for
each sequence length m = 1, . . . , 15 in the RB experiment,
and use the same sequences without the recovery gate in the
PB experiment.

Figure 1. (Color online) Quantum circuits for (a) RB, (b) PB, and
(c) GST. In all three experiments, the initial state is ρi = σz and
the measurements M are spin echo detection sequences for mea-
suring (cid:104)σz(cid:105) for RB, (cid:104)σx,y,z(cid:105) for PB, and (cid:104)σx,y(cid:105) for GST. A total
of 78 uniformly random sequences with Pj ∈ {I, X90, Y90} and
Sj ∈ {I, X180, Y180} (and virtual z-axis rotations) are applied for
each sequence length m. The recovery gate R in RB is designed
that the state would evolve back to either ±σz in the absence of
noise. The gates Ul, Um, and Un are exhaustively sampled from
{ X90, Y90, X180, Y180, I} for GST. (d) and (e) are the spin echo
detection sequences for measuring (cid:104)σz(cid:105) and (cid:104)σx,y(cid:105), respectively.
The π/2 and π pulses are around y-axis, and τ=700 ns represents
a delay.

The RB and PB protocols assume that the noise is indepen-
dent of the gate or has weak gate-dependence, which is likely
violated in real systems. To study the robustness of RB and
PB to gate-dependent noise, we also implement GST [12] to
reconstruct the process matrices of the ﬁve OC pulses and use
them to compare with the benchmarking results. GST is im-
plemented by preparing ρi = σz and then applying three op-
erations Ul, Um, Un ∈ {X90, Y90, X180, Y180, I} and mea-
suring the expectation values (cid:104)σx(cid:105) and (cid:104)σy(cid:105). Let Qexp ={Q1,
Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5} denote the Pauli process matrices [38] of
the experimentally-implemented { X90, Y90, X180, Y180, I}

pulses and mk,lmn denote the expectation value of σk after ap-
plying Ul, Um, Un. We estimate the Pauli process matrices by
measuring the expectation values for each of the 125 combi-
nations of three OC pulses and minimizing

σj ∈ {1l, σx, σy, σz} (j = 1, 2, 3, 4).

Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively. Both the  and in in the middle
column agree with the experimental benchmarking data, indicating
the robustness of RB and PB to gate-dependent noise. The in in the
right column are substantially different from the experimental bench-
marking data, indicating PB gives the average of the unitarities (avu)
instead of the unitarity of the average noise (uav).

Pulse distortion due to the resonator and/or other electronic
components of the spectrometer is signiﬁcant, as the transfer

are in close agreement with the experimental results.

average coherent error ( − in) and incoherent error can be
seen. This shows that the pulse distortion is non-negligible,
and causes error that contains both coherent and incoherent
parts. The incoherent part is largely due to the OC pulses los-
ing their robustness to B0 and B1 ﬁeld inhomogeneities when
the transfer function is neglected.

In contrast, the spin-packet selection sequence (purple cir-
cles in Fig. 2) improves the incoherent error from (8.0±0.7)×
10−3 to (6.0± 0.5)× 10−3, but has no statistically signiﬁcant
effect on the coherent contribution to the error,  − in, which
is (1.9± 0.8)× 10−3 and (2.6± 1.0)× 10−3 with and without
spin-packet selection, respectively.
To further understand the remaining errors, we performed
numerical simulations assuming the spins experience the ideal
OC pulses and using a Lindblad equation to simulate T1 and
T2 processes. The T ∗
2 process is included by averaging over
multiple simulations with different local ﬁeld strengths. Our
simulations give values of  = (7.4 ± 0.5) × 10−3 and
in = (7.4± 0.4)× 10−3 when T ∗
2 = 55 ns (corresponding to
the experiments without the spin packet selection sequence)
and  = (5.8 ± 0.3) × 10−3 and in = (5.7 ± 0.2) × 10−3
when T ∗
2 = 93 ns (corresponding to the experiments with
the spin-packet selection sequence). The amount of coher-
ent error in these simulations is almost negligible, of order
∼ 10−4. This suggests that the experimental coherent error is
mainly due to microwave pulse distortion that can be traced

to inaccuracy in the measured transfer function. The larger
incoherent error seen in the experiments can also be attributed
to imperfect knowledge of the transfer function, which ren-
ders the OC pulses less robust to ﬁeld inhomogeneity. By
comparing the experimental and simulation results, we can
determine a budget for the experimental error . In the exper-
iments that include spin-packet selection, the error budget for
 is the following: T1 and T2 contribute an incoherent error of
4.5× 10−3; T ∗
2 contributes an incoherent error of 1.5× 10−3;
the inaccuracies in the measured transfer function cause a co-
herent error of about 1.9 × 10−3.
The above analysis of the RB and PB results assumes that
the noise is gate-independent. We performed GST to inves-
tigate the robustness of RB and PB to gate-dependent noise.
The estimated process matrices for the ﬁve OC pulses are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Material. Before analyzing the
gate dependence of the noise, we ﬁrst veriﬁed the consis-
tency between the GST and the benchmarking experimental
data using these process matrices to simulate the RB and PB
sequences. We estimated the SPAM by minimizing the vari-
ance between the simulated values of (cid:104)σj(cid:105) and the experimen-
tal values over all benchmarking sequences of length at most
three (to match the sequence lengths used in GST). The av-
erages over random sequences of a ﬁxed length are plotted in
Fig. 2 using ﬁlled markers and agree closely with the experi-
mental data.

investigated perturbatively. In particular, it has been shown
that the zeroth-order model Apm + B holds to within (m +
1)γ [23], where

γ = |G|

−1 (cid:88)G∈G

max ψ(cid:107)(E(G) − E)(ψ)(cid:107)1.

(9)

Here G is the group being benchmarked, (cid:107)K(cid:107)1 = Tr√K†K
is the trace norm, E is the average noise channel, and E(G)
is the noise channel corresponding to the gate G. The value
γ captures the worst variation of G from the average chan-
nel. From the GST process matrices, we obtain γ0 = 0.248,
γtran = 0.0274, and γsel = 0.0279, which correspond to the
cases of neglecting the transfer function, accounting for it,
and adding the selection sequence, respectively. These values
are non-negligible, implying non-negligible gate-dependent
noise. However, the estimated average gate errors from RB
are consistent with the estimates calculated from the process
matrices (listed in Tab. I), suggesting that RB is substantially
more robust to gate-dependent noise than indicated by the per-
turbative analysis of Ref. [23].

The PB protocol has only been analyzed under the assump-
tion of gate-independent noise. One immediate question is
whether the decay parameter should be the average of the uni-
tarities of the gate-dependent noise,

avu = |G|

−1 (cid:88)G∈G

u[E(G)],

or the unitarity of the average noise,

uav = u(cid:34)|G|

−1 (cid:88)G∈G

E(G)(cid:35) .

(10)

(11)

These two quantities are not equal in general as the unitarity
is not a linear function of quantum channels. The incoher-
ent errors from Eq. (5) for both quantities are listed with the
experimentally-observed incoherent error in Tab. I, showing
that avu is in very close agreement with the observed decay,
whereas uav is substantially different. Therefore, the PB pro-
tocol measures the average of the incoherent errors of the gate-
dependent noise instead of the incoherent error of the noise
averaged over the gates being benchmarked.

Conclusions– We have demonstrated how RB and PB can
be used together to go beyond quantifying the average error
by distinguishing coherent and incoherent contributions to the
error. The coherent error in our experiments mainly comes
from inaccuracy in determining the transfer function of the
microwave resonator. The incoherent error is primarily due to
2 processes. We demonstrate that extending T ∗
T1, T2 and T ∗
2
reduces the incoherent error and has a negligible effect on the
coherent error. We calculate a budget for the remaining exper-
imental error  and show that incoherent error dominates.

There is good cross-validation between GST and bench-
marking experiments. Utilizing GST to determine the gate-
dependent errors also allows us to conclude: (1) RB and PB

5

are both very robust to gate-dependence of noise; (2) the av-
erage of the incoherent errors of the individual noises, rather
than the incoherent error of the average noise, can be esti-
mated from the decay rate obtained from PB. As different op-
timizations can be used to reduce the error for the individual
noises, the average of the gate-dependent incoherent errors is
always more relevant than the incoherent error of the aver-
age noise in assessing quantum control. Therefore, the fact
that PB enables the average of the incoherent errors to be es-
timated makes it a more useful diagnostic in the presence of
gate-dependent noise.

Our measurement of the transfer function, using spin re-
sponses, provides a good estimate but is not perfect. An im-
proved method for measuring the transfer function, or com-
bining with other methods [35, 36], is expected to enable
higher control ﬁdelities. OC pulses are useful (and often nec-
essary) for controlling multi-qubit systems, such as hyperﬁne-
coupled electron-nuclear systems. Using OC pulses to realize
high-ﬁdelity multi-qubit gates is the next step for this work.
