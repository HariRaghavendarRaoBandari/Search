1. Introduction

Let X be a connected complex projective manifold. It may be ‘split’
by its ‘rational quotient map’1 ρ : X 99K R into its antithetical parts:
‘rationally connected’ (the ﬁbres), and ‘not-uniruled’ (the base R). The

objective2 of the present text is to extend these notions and ‘splitting’
to the category of smooth ‘orbifold pairs’.

We ﬁrst recall the notions used in the classical case when D = 0. In
our previous text [11], we observed (directly from several other funda-
mental results in this topic: [21], [19], [15], [2], [8]) that:

Proposition 1.1. For a smooth connected complex manifold X, the
following 4 properties are equivalent:

1. X is rationally connected (i.e: any two points can be connected

by some rational curve)

2. For any ample line bundle A on X, there is an m(A) > 0 such

2’. For any ample line bundle A on X, there is an m′(A) > 0 such

3. For any dominant rational map f : X 99K Z, with Z smooth and

dim(Z) > 0, KZ is not pseudo-eﬀective.

4. µα,min(T X) > 0 for some movable class α on X (see below for

these notions).

In Theorem 1.2 below, we will show the equivalence of the properties
2, 3, 4 above for ‘smooth orbifold pairs’ (X, D). These properties not
involving rational curves, we make the link with them by also intro-
ducing (see deﬁnition 1.5) a notion of rational connectedness for such
pairs, deﬁning ‘orbifold rational curves’, and is a priori stronger than
these 3 properties. We expect however (see §.9 below) that it might be
equivalent to them, too.

In order to describe our results, we need to recall some notions used

here, more details are in §.2.

Let (X, D) be a ‘smooth projective orbifold pair. In our previous text
[11] (see also [5] and [6]), we introduced orbifold (co)tangent sheaves for
general smooth orbifold pairs as above, by lifting them to any suitable
Galois-Kummer ‘Kawamata cover’ π : X ′ → (X, D) adapted to the
pair under consideration. We thus obtained dual locally-free sheaves
π∗(T (X, D)) ⊂ π∗(T X) and π∗(Ω1(X, D)) ⊃ π∗(Ω1
X ). Their determi-
nants are the π-liftings of the usual anticanonical and canonical Q-
bundles ±(KX + D).
Let now α be a movable class on X (see [9], [11] for these notions).
The notions of slope, (semi-)stability, Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltrations
of torsion-free sheaves E on X are deﬁned as in the classical case of
polarisations, with the same properties3. In particular, the property
µα,min(E) > 0 means that any quotient Q of E has a strictly positive
α-slope. Our ﬁrst main result here is the following:

2Motivated by the ‘decomposition c = (J ◦ r)n of the ‘core map’. See Section 10.
3The restriction theorem of Mehta-Ramanathan however fails in this context.

Theorem 1.2. Let (X, D) be a smooth orbifold pair. The following
properties are equivalent:

1. For any dominant rational map f : X 99K Z with connected
ﬁbres, the orbifold base (Z, DZ) of any ‘neat model’ of (f, D)
has a canonical bundle KZ + DZ which is not pseudo-eﬀective,
if dim(Z) > 0.

2. For any ample line bundle A on X, there is an m(A) > 0 such

3. One has: µG

2’. For any ample line bundle A on X, there is an m′(A) > 0 such

that h0(X ′, π∗(⊗m(Ω1(X, D)) ⊗ π∗(A) = 0,∀m ≥ m(A).
that h0(X ′, Symm(π∗(Ω1(X, D))) ⊗ π∗(A) = 0,∀m ≥ m′(A).
π∗(α),min(π∗(T X, D)) > 0, for some movable class α
on X. Here G := Gal(X ′/X), and µG
α,min refers to G-invariant
quotient sheaves of π∗(T (X, D)) on X ′. Moreover, the class α
can be chosen to be ‘movable-big’ (i.e: interior to the movable
cone of X).

A smooth projective orbifold pair satisfying these properties will be

said to be ‘slope-Rationally Connected’, or sRC for short.

An important example of ‘slope Rationally connected’ smooth orb-

ifolds is the following4:

Theorem 1.3. Let (X, D) be a smooth orbifold pair which is klt5, and
Fano (ie: −(KX + D) is ample on X). Then (X, D) is slope rationally
connected.

Notice that the conclusion in general fails when (X, D) is smooth,
Fano, but not klt, as shown by (P2, D) if D is the union of 2 distinct
lines: this has a birational orbifold model which maps onto (P1, δ),
where δ consists of 2 distinct points, an orbifold with trivial canonical
bundle.

The proof of Theorem 1.2 works entirely in characteristic 0, and
makes no reference to rational curves; it only uses [2] and [11] among
the results quoted above. Notice also that, when D = 0, the implication
1 =⇒ 3 of 1.2 is weaker than the similar implication 3 =⇒ 4 of 1.1 for
several reasons: ﬁrst, the property 1 in Theorem 1.2 requires to take
into account the ‘orbifold base’, while property 3 in Proposition 1.1
does not6, next Proposition 1.1 shows that α is then represented by a
movable rational curve C, and ﬁnally a Mehta-Ramanathan type result
is needed to show that µα,min(T X) = µα,min(T X|C) if α = [C].

Theorem 1.2 permits to deﬁne a ‘Rational quotient’ in the category

of ‘orbifold pairs’ as follows7 (see the proof in 7.1):

4Answering a question of B. Claudon.
5This means that all coeﬃcients of the components of D are strictly less than 1.
6More precisely, [15] shows that the orbifold base is trivial in this context.
7See [23] for a link between movable classes and ‘rational quotient’ when D = 0.

Theorem 1.4. Let (X, D) be smooth, complex projective and con-
nected. There exists (on some suitable birational model) an orbifold
morphism which is a ﬁbration ρ : (X, D) → (R, DR) onto its (smooth)
orbifold base (R, DR) which has the following two properties:

1. Its smooth orbifold ﬁbres (Xr, Dr) are sRC.
2. KR + DR is pseudo-eﬀective.
This ﬁbration is unique, up to orbifold birational equivalence.

A similar orbifold ﬁbration was deﬁned in [5], [6] conditionally in
either an orbifold version C orb
n,m of Iitaka’s Cn,m conjecture, or in the
‘non-vanishing’ conjecture. The present text permits to give an uncon-
ditional (conjecturally equivalent) deﬁnition, similar to the shift from
‘Kodaira’ to ‘numerical’ dimension. See Section 10 for some details.

Theorem 1.2 and the last remarks suggest a deﬁnition of rational-
connectedness using rational curves.

Deﬁnition 1.5. We say that the smooth orbifold pair (X, D) is ‘rationally-
connected’ if there exists an irreducible rational curve and an adapted
Kawamata-cover π : X ′ → (X, D) such that π∗(C) := C ′ is irreducible,
and π∗(T (X, D)) restricted to (the normalisation of ) C ′ is ample.

We have the following easy result.

Proposition 1.6. If the smooth orbifold pair (X, D) is rationally-
connected in the above sense, it satisﬁes also the 3 properties stated
in Theorem 1.2. Moreover, the restriction of TX to the rational curve
C in the deﬁnition is ample, too; so that X itself is rationally connected.

The expectation is that the converse also holds, that is:

if (X, D)
satisﬁes one of the 3 properties in Theorem 1.2, then it should be
‘rationally-connected’ in the sense of 1.5. We shortly discuss in Section
9 this implication.

Let us give a very brief description of the proof of theorem 1.2: the
implications 3 ⇒ 2 and 2 ⇒ 1 are easy and standard. The main im-
plication 1 ⇒ 3 requires several steps and intermediate constructions.
The main ingredient in the proof is the main result of [11] stating that
if F ⊂ π∗(T (X, D)) is a D-foliation of positive minimal slope for π∗(α),
with α some movable class on X, then F descends to an algebraic fo-
liation FX = Ker(df ), f : X 99K Z with α.(KX/Z + D) < 0 (on any
‘neat’ model of f ), with dim(Z) < n := dim(X).
The ﬁrst step is to chose α such that dim(Z) = p < n is maximal,
then change α in such a way that f∗(α) = 0, with α ‘big’ on the ‘general’
ﬁbre Xz of f . The minimality of the rank of F then permits to show
that F is still the maximal destabilising foliation associated to the
new α, and is α-semi-stable (of positive slope). If F = π∗(T (X, D)),
we are ﬁnished. Otherwise, by induction on dim(X) := n, we get a
movable class β on Z such that µp∗(β),min(p∗(T (Z, DZ))) > 0, where
p : Z ′ → (Z, DZ) is a Kawamata cover adapted to (Z, DZ), the orbifold

5

base of a ‘neat model’ f : (X, D) → Z of our initial f . We then
chose a movable lifting βX of β to X (i.e: such that f∗(βX) = β),
and show that if γ := λ.α + βX , then µγ,min(π∗(T (X, D))) > 0 for
λ > 0 suﬃciently big. This is here that the relative bigness of α is
needed. Here some technical diﬃculties arise coming from the fact
that the image of π∗(df ) : π∗(T (X, D)) → (f ◦ π)∗(T (Z, DZ)) is not
surjective on some f -vertical divisors. They can be handled using a
‘negativity-type’ lemma.

In §.7, we establish Theorem 1.4. In §.9, we study conditions under
which such a class α can be choosen to be represented by a ‘movable
rational curve’ .

Thanks. This text was essentially conceived during a stay at KIAS
in November-December 2015 of FC. We thank this institution for its
support and excellent working conditions, and especially the staﬀ of
KIAS for their eﬃciency and amability.

We now start by several technical sections needed in the proof of

Theorem 1.2.

2. Orbifold morphisms

2.1. Orbifold morphisms. We ﬁrst recall some notions introduced
in [6], §.2 and §.3, which are needed here8.

Let (X, D) be an orbifold pair; this consists of a connected complex

projective normal variety X, together with an ‘orbifold divisor’

(1)

D := XF ⊂X

cD(F ).F,

where the components F are all the pairwise distinct irreducible (Weil)
divisors on X, and the coeﬃcients cD(F ) are zero for all but a ﬁnite
a
b ∈ [0, 1] ∩ Q are,
number of divisors F . The coeﬃcients cD(F ) =
moreover, rational numbers with a, b coprime positive integers.
1

We will need to also write: cD(F ) = 1 −

in terms of:
mD(F ) = (1−c(F ))−1, the ‘multiplicities of the F ′s in D’, with the con-
vention that +∞ = 1
0 is in Q. The correspondence between coeﬃcients
and multiplicities is bijective and strictly increasing. Any irreducible
divisor F of X not in the support of D, has thus coeﬃcient cD(F ) := 0,
and so multiplicity mD(F ) = 1 in D.

,

mD(F )

The multiplicities have a natural geometric meaning: for example,
if all cD(F ) are of the form (1 − 1
), for integers mF , then D is a
ramiﬁcation divisor. Moreover, the geometric functorial properties in

mF

8All deﬁnitions and properties stated here work for compact complex normal
spaces, and even, more generally for proper holomorphic ﬁbrations. But we shall
need them only in the projective case.

6

FRÉDÉRIC CAMPANA AND MIHAI PĂUN

the ‘orbifold category’ are expressed in terms of multiplicities, not in
terms of coeﬃcients (see below).

The pairs (X, D) will be usually be supposed to be ‘smooth’, meaning
tha X is smooth, and that the support Supp(D) := ∪{F ⊂X:cD(F )6=0}F
has simple normal crossings. These ‘smooth’ orbifolds will now be
turned, following [6], into a category.

2.2. Deﬁnitions. Let f : X → Z be a regular map with connected
ﬁbres between two complex connected normal projective varieties. As-
sume that orbifold structures (X, DX) and (Z, DZ) are given on X and
Z, respectively. For any irreducible divisor E on Z, let:

(2)

f ∗(E) := XF ⊂X|f (F )=E

cf ∗(E)(F ) · F + R,

where R ⊂ X is an f -exceptional eﬀective divisor (ie: such that f (R) (
E is of codimension at least 2 in Z). Notice that R = 0 if f is ﬂat.

If E is Q-Cartier on Z, in particular if Z is smooth, or when f has
equidimensional ﬁbres (for example, if it is ﬂat), we can more precisely
deﬁne the coeﬃcients cf ∗(E)(F ) for any component F of f −1(E) of the
scheme-theoretic f -inverse of F :

(3)

f ∗(E) := XF ⊂X

cf ∗(E)(F ) · F

In general, when f : X → Z is a ﬁbration, and when the coeﬃcient
t := cf ∗(E)(F ) is deﬁned for f (F ) ⊂ E, we shall simply write: f ∗(E) =
t.F + ... to isolate the component F from the other components of
f −1(E).

Deﬁnition 2.1. ([6], Déﬁnition 2.3) We say that f is an ‘orbifold
morphism’ if, for any E ⊂ Z, we have:
(4)

cf ∗(E)(F ) · mDX (F ) ≥ mDZ (E),

for each F such that cf ∗(E)(F ) > 0,provided cf ∗(E)(F ) is well-deﬁned
for each Weil divisor E in Z and each Weil divisor F in X. The two
main situations considered here are either when Z is smooth, or when
f has equidimensional ﬁbres.

The orbifold morphism f : (X, DX) → (Z, DZ) is said to be an
‘orbifold birational equivalence’ if f : X → Z is birational, and if
DZ = f⋆(DX). We have here to assume that Z is smooth (or Q-
factorial) in order for this to make sense if X 6= Z. The ‘orbifold
birational equivalence relation’ is the one generated by this binary sym-
metric relation.

The orbifold morphism f is said to be ‘neat’ if (X, DX) and (Z, DZ)
are smooth, and if, moreover, f −1[f (Supp(D))∪Df ] is of simple normal

7

crossings, where Df is the divisor on X where df , the derivative of f ,
is not of maximal rank.

The reason for these deﬁnitions will appear below, when composition

of ﬁbrations are considered. See [6] for further details.

Notice that, Supp(DZ) ⊂ f (Supp(DX)), and DZ ≤ f∗(DX) if f is
birational, but even if DZ = f∗(DX ), it is not true that f : (X, DX) →
(Z, DZ) is an orbifold morphism, in general.

Remark 2.2. Let us give an example (extracted from [6], and in-
spired by the Cremona transformation) which shows that if (X, Di), i =
1, 2 are smooth and orbifold-birationally equivalent to some smooth
(X, D) for some orbifold divisors Di, D on the same X, and if D+ =
sup(D1, D2), it may happen that (X, D+) is no longer orbifold bira-
tional to them.

Let b : X → P2 be the blow-up in 3 points a, b, c in general posi-
tion, together with the 3 exceptional curves A, B, C. Let α, β, γ be the
three lines going through two of these points, and α′, β′, γ′ their inverse
images in X. We thus get a new map b′
: X → (P2)′ contracting
the 3 curves α′, β′, γ′. Consider the three (reduced) orbifold divisors
D := A + B + C, D′ := α′ + β′ + γ′, and D+ := sup{D, D′) = D + D′
on X. Then b : (X, D) → P2, b′
: (X, D′) → (P2)′ are birational
orbifold equivalences (the bases being equipped with the zero orbifold di-
visors). Since so are b : X → P2, and b′ : X → (P2)′, the identity map
of X induces orbifold birational equivalences: (X, D) ∼= X ∼= (X, D′)
as well. Let ∆ := b∗(D′) and ∆′ := (b′)∗(D) be orbifold divisors on P2
and (P2)′ respectively. Then b : (X, D+) → (P2, ∆) and b′ : (X, D+) →
((P2)′, ∆′) are also birational orbifold equivalences, but b : (X, D′) →
(P2, ∆) and b′ : (X, D) → ((P2)′, ∆′) are not orbifold morphisms, al-
though they map to their orbifold bases (deﬁned below). Notice also that
D+ is not orbifold-birationally equivalent to (X, D), (X, D′), X, since:
κ(X, D+) = 0 > −∞ = κ(X, D) = κ(X, D′), and birational orbifold
equivalence preserves the Kodaira dimension (and more generally, the
diﬀerentials, see Proposition 2.11 below).
2.3. Orbifold base of a ﬁbration. Let a ﬁbration f : X → Z be
given, X, Z being normal connected, and X moreover equipped with
an orbifold structure (X, DX ).
Deﬁnition 2.3. ([6], Déﬁnition 3.2) Let then E ⊂ Z be an irreducible
divisor, and, as deﬁned above:

(5)

f ∗(E) = R + Xf (F )=E

cf ∗(E)(F ) · F,

where R is an f -exceptional divisor (i.e: codimX (f (R)) ≥ 2).

Deﬁne the multiplicity m(f,DX )(E) of E relative to (f, DX) by:

(6)

m(f,DX )(E) := inf

f (F )=E

cf ∗(E)(F ) · mD(F ),

8

FRÉDÉRIC CAMPANA AND MIHAI PĂUN

and the ‘orbifold base’ DZ(f, DX ) = DZ on Z by the equality:

(7)

DZ := XE⊂Z(cid:16)1 −

1

m(f,DX )(E)(cid:17).E

The sum above being ﬁnite, this is an orbifold divisor on Z.

In general, f : (X, DX) → (Z, DZ) is not an orbifold morphism, because
the multiplicities on the f -exceptional divisors of X are not taken into
account, and may be too small. However, it is always possible to obtain
an orbifold morphism simply by ﬂattening f and increasing suﬃciently
the multiplicities of DX on the exceptional divisors of f .
Lemma 2.4. ([6], Proposition 3.10) Let f : (X, DX) → Z be a ﬁbra-
tion, wth (X, DX ) smooth, and Z normal. There exists a birational orb-
ifold morphism g : (X ′, D′) → (X, DX ) and a modiﬁcation h : Z ′ → Z,
with Z ′ smooth, together with a ﬁbration f ′ : (X ′, D′) → Z ′ such that:

(1) f ◦ g = h ◦ f ′.
(2) The orbifold base (Z ′, DZ ′) of f ′ : (X, D′) → Z ′ is smooth.
(3) f ′ : (X ′, D′) → (Z ′, DZ ′) is a neat orbifold morphism.

2.4. Composition of ﬁbrations. In this subsection we consider two
ﬁbrations f : (X, DX ) → Y and g : Y → Z with (X, DX ), as well as Y
and Z smooth. We aim at determining the orbifold base (Z, D(g◦f,D))
of the composition (g ◦ f, DX) in the ‘smooth orbifold category’. The
natural candidate is the orbifold base (Z, D(g,DY )) of g, with (Y, DY )
the orbifold base of (f, DX), that is: DY := D(f,DX ) .

The two orbifold bases (Z, D(g◦f,D)) and (Y, DY ) on Z are diﬀerent:
one always has: D(g◦f,DX ) ≤ D(g,DY ) with strict inequality in general.
This is because of divisors F ⊂ X of small multiplicity which are f -
exceptional, but not g ◦ f -exceptional. This phenomenon is however
excluded when f is an ‘orbifold’ morphism:
Proposition 2.5. ([6], Proposition 3.14). Let f : (X, DX ) → Y and
g : Y → Z be ﬁbrations. Let (Y, DY ) be the orbifold base of (f, DX).
Assume that the induced map f : (X, DX) → (Y, DY ) is an orbifold
morphism. Then we have (Z, D(g◦f,D)) = (Z, D(g,DY )).

2.5. Birational equivalence of ﬁbrations. The example given in 2.2
shows that birational orbifold equivalence is not preserved by taking the
smallest orbifold divisor dominating given ones. This drastically diﬀers
from the classical case of manifolds, and shows that some more care
is needed here. Our objective here is the following result 2.6 and 2.10
(which answers the Question 3.12 raised in [6], and reﬁnes Corollaire
4.14 there).
Theorem 2.6. Let fi : (X, D) → (Zi, Di), i = 1, 2 be ﬁbrations, which
are orbifold morphisms, with Z1 and Z2 smooth, where Di = D(fi,D)
are the orbifold bases of (fi, D), i = 1, 2. Assume that the ﬁbrations

Z

fi are birationally equivalent (ie: Z ′′ := (f1 × f2(X)) ⊂ (Z1 × Z2) is
the graph of a birational map between Z1 and Z2). Then (Z1, D1) and
(Z2, D2) are birationally equivalent.
Proof. Let Z ′ be the normalisation of Z ′′ deﬁned above, together with
the two natural projections gi : Z ′ → Zi. The conclusion then follows
from the following Lemma 2.7 applied to the gi.
: (X, D) → Z ′ be a ﬁbration between normal
Lemma 2.7. Let f ′
connected projective complex spaces, and g : Z ′ → Z be birational, with
Z smooth. Assume that f : (X, D) → (Z, DZ) is an orbifold morphism,
where DZ is the orbifold base of (f, D). Let DZ ′ be the orbifold base of
f ′ : (X, D) → Z ′. Then g : (Z ′, DZ ′) → (Z, DZ) is a birational orbifold
equivalence.
Proof. Let E ⊂ Z and E′ ⊂ Z ′ be irreducible divisors with g(E′) ⊂ E.
We thus have: g∗(E) = c.E′ + ... for some integer c > 0, since Z is
(E′) ≥ mDZ (E), with equality if
smooth. We have to show that c.mD′
g(E′) = E, in which case we have c = 1.
Let thus F ⊂ X an irreducible divisor such that g′(F ) = E′. We
have: f ∗(E) = t.F ′ + ...., and f ′∗(E′) = t′.F ′. Moreover, t = c.t′ since
f ∗(E) = (f ′)∗(g∗(E)), and since f ′(F ) = E′. On the other hand, since
f is an orbifold morphism and (Z ′, DZ ′) is the orbifold base of (f ′, D),
we have: t.mD(F ) ≥ mDZ (E), and t′.mD(F ) ≥ mD′

We distinguish the two cases: g(E) = E′ and g(E′) 6= E.
Assume ﬁrst9 that g(E′) = E, so that c = 1 and g : E′ → E is
birational. We have t = c.t′ = t′ in this case. We may then choose F in
such a way that t′.mD(F ) = mDZ ′ (E′). Thus mDZ (E) ≤ mDZ ′ (E′). By
choosing now F such that f (F ) = E and t.mD(F ) = mDZ (E), we get
the reverse inequality, since f ′(F ) = E′, and t′.mD(F ) ≥ mDZ ′ (E′).
If now g(E′) 6= E, E′ is g-exceptional. Let F be such that t′.mD(F ) =
mDZ ′ (E′), and t.mD(F ) = c.t′.mD(F ) = c.mDZ ′ (E′). Since (f, D) is an
orbifold morphism, and f (F ) ⊂ E, we have: t.mD(F ) ≥ mDZ (E), and
the inequality mDZ (E) ≤ c.mDZ ′ (E′).
Lemma 2.8. Let (Zi, Di), i = 1, 2 two orbifolds with Zi smooth. Let gi :
Z → Zi be birational, with Z normal and D be an orbifold divisor on Z.
Assume that gi : (Z, D) → (Zi, Di) are birational orbifold morphisms,
with (gi)∗(D) = Di. Let g : Z ′ → Z be any desingularisation. There
exists an orbifold divisor D′ on D such that g∗(D′) = D and gi ◦ g :
(Z ′, D′) → (Zi, Di), i = 1, 2 are birational orbifold equivalences.
Proof. All g-exceptional divisors on Z ′ are gi ◦ g-exceptional, for i =
1, 2. By putting on them suﬃciently large multiplicities we can thus
make (gi ◦ g, D′) orbifold morphisms. Because this does not change the

Lemma 2.9. Let f : (X, D) → (Z, DZ) be a ﬁbration which is an
orbifold morphism onto its orbifold base (Z, DZ), with Z smooth. Let
g : (Z ′, DZ ′) → (Z, DZ) be a birational orbifold equivalence with Z ′
smooth. There exists a birational orbifold equivalence h : (X ′, D′) →
(X, D) with X smooth such that f ◦ h = g ◦ f ′ for some ﬁbration
f ′ : (X ′, D′) → (Z ′, dZ ′) which is an orbifold morphism onto its orbifold
base.
Proof. Take any birational h : X ′ → X with X ′ smooth such that
f ′ : X ′ → Z ′ exists with f ◦ h = g ◦ f ′. For each irreducible divisor
F ′ ⊂ X ′ which is h-exceptional, its image by f ′ is contained in or
equal to some irreducible g-exceptional divisor E′ ⊂ Z ′. By putting
on F ′ somme suﬃciently large multiplicity, we get a suitable orbifold
sutructure D′ on X ′. (The details are easy, and one can make explicit
the smallest such orbifold structure).
(cid:3)
Theorem 2.10. Let fi : (Xi, Di) → (Z, DZi), i = 1, 2 be two ﬁbrations
which are orbifold morphisms on their orbifold bases, with Zi, i = 1, 2
smooth. Assume that (Xi, Di), i = 1, 2 are birationally orbifold equiv-
alent and that fi are birationally equivalent (ie: so are Xi and fi as
seen on the graph of a birational equivalence of X1 and X2). Then
(Zi, DZi), i = 1, 2 are birationally orbifold equivalent.

Proof. By the deﬁnition of birational orbifold equivalence, we may as-
sume the existence of some birational orbifold equivalence h : (X1, D1) →
(X2, D2). The composition f2◦h : (X1, D1) → (Z2, DZ2) is thus an orb-
ifold morphism onto its orbifold base. The conclusion then follows from
Theorem 2.6, the lemmas 2.8 and 2.9 showing that the birational orb-
ifold equivalence between (Z1, D1) and Z2, D2) can be realised through
an orbifold (Z ′, DZ ′) with Z ′ smooth.
(cid:3)

2.6. Diﬀerentials and orbifold morphisms. We show here a cru-
cial functoriality property of diﬀerentials for orbifold morphisms. This
property is actually almost a characterisation of orbifold morphisms
(see [6], Proposition 2.10, for a similar result).

Let f : (X, DX ) → (Z, DZ) be an orbifold morphism, and π : Y → X
and p : W → Z be Kawamata covers adapted to (X, DX) and (Z, DZ)
respectively. Let G and H be the ﬁnite groups acting on Y and W
respectively. Let

(8)

T := (Y ×Z W )n

be the normalisation of any component of the ﬁbred product, together
with the natural projections ρ : T → Y and τ : T → W . The projection
π ◦ τ : T → X is still Galois, with group L, normal in (G × H), the
stabilizer of T in (Y ×Z W )n, the group L being onto on both G and H.
The components of (Y ×Z W )n being exchanged under the operation
of (G × H)/L.

Let df : T X → f ∗(T Z) be the derivative of f . Its lifting to T induces

a map:

11

(π ◦ ρ)∗(df ) : (π ◦ ρ)∗(T X) → (f ◦ π ◦ ρ)∗(T Z) = (p ◦ τ )∗(T Z).

(9)
We recall (see [11]) that we have the natural inclusions π∗(T (X, D)) ⊂
π∗(T X) as well as p∗(T (Z, DZ) ⊂ p∗(T Z).
Proposition 2.11. If f is an orbifold morphism, there is an inclusion:

(10)

of sheaves on T .

(π ◦ ρ)∗(df )(cid:0)ρ∗(π∗(T (X, DX))(cid:1) ⊂ τ ∗(p∗(T (Z, DZ)))

Proof. Because both sheaves ρ∗(π∗(T (X, D))) and τ ∗(p∗(T (Z, DZ)))
are locally free, it is suﬃcient to establish the statement in codimension
one on T , so in codimension one over Y , or X. It is thus suﬃcient to
consider the situation over generic points of a divisor F of X which
is contained in f −1(Supp(DZ)), since τ ∗(p∗(T (Z, DZ)) ( τ ∗(p∗(T Z))
only there.

Let thus x0 ∈ F be such a point, and z0 = f (x0) ∈ f (F ) ⊂ E =
f (F ). We may thus assume that, in suitable coordinates x = (x1, ..., xn)
for X near x0 and z = (z1, ..., zp) for Z near z0 := f (x0) the following
hold true near x0 and z0: E = {z1 = z2 = ... = zq = 0}, for some
1 ≤ q ≤ p. Write Eh = f −1(zh = 0), and: f ∗(Eh) = th.F + ..., for some
integer th ≥ 1, for h ∈ {1, ..., q}.

(a) The divisor F is given by the equation x1 = 0 near x0.
(b) f is given, for holomorphic functions gℓ(x), ℓ ∈ {1, ..., p}, by:

f (x1, ..., xn) = (xt1

if one considers its j-th component for j ≤ q, and one uses that
F ( f ∗(Ej) for j = q + 1, ..., p. The assertion for df (∂xk), k ≥ 2 follows
from the same computation of df (∂x2), and simpler estimates of expo-
nents, with sj replaced by sj + 1 for j ≤ q, based on: m′
j ≥ m,∀j ≤ q.

(cid:3)

The preceding computation moreover shows that10, since Supp(DX) ⊂
f −1(DZ) when (Z, DZ) is the orbifold base of (f, DX), the quotient
sheaf τ ∗(p∗(T (Z, DZ))/(π ◦ ρ)∗(df )(ρ∗(π∗(T (X, DX))) is supported on
the inverse image in T of the components F of f −1(DZ) for which:
t.m > m′ in the above notations. The union eF ⊂ X is thus a divisor
partially supported on the ﬁbres of f in the following sense.
Deﬁnition 2.12. (See [5]) Let f : X → Z be as before. Let F :=
∪s∈SFs be a ﬁnite union of irreducible divisors of X. We say that ‘F is
partially supported on the ﬁbres of f ’ if, for each s ∈ S, either Fs is f -
exceptional (ie: codimZ(f (Fs)) ≥ 2), or if the following two properties
hold:

1. f (Fs) := Es is a divisor of Z.
2. f −1(Es) ∩ F ( f −1(Es). (ie: at least one irreducible component

of the RHS is not a component of F ).

We thus have the following corollary.
Proposition 2.13. Let the situation f : (X, DX) → (Z, DZ) be as
above, with (Z, DZ) the orbifold base of (f, DX ).
The quotient sheaf τ ∗(p∗(T (Z, DZ))/(π◦ρ)∗(df )(ρ∗(π∗(T (X, DX))) is
supported in (π◦ ρ)−1(F ), where F ⊂ X is a divisor partially supported
on the ﬁbres of f .

3. Relative movable classes

We consider here a ﬁbration f : X → Z between two connected
complex projective manifolds. We denote by Mov(X) ⊂ N1(X) the
closed cone of movable classes on X, by Mov0(X) its interior, and
similarly for Z. There is a natural surjective direct image map:

f∗ : N1(X) → N1(Z),

(11)
dual to the inverse image map f ∗ : N 1(Z) → N 1(X). The kernel
N1(X/Z) of f∗ is the orthogonal of the image of f ∗.
Let Mov(X/Z) := Mov(X)∩ N1(X/Z) be the closed cone of relative
1 (X/Z) ⊂ N1(X/Z) be the real vector

movable classes for f , and let N 0

10Up to f-exceptional divisors F ⊂ X.

13

space generated by Mov(X/Z). We denote the interior of Mov(X/Z)
in N 0

1 (X/Z) by: Mov0(X/Z).

We state without proof a result not used in the sequel (the proof can

be given by the argument proving Proposition 3.6.6 below):

Proposition 3.1. The quotient vector space N1(X/Z)/N 0
1 (X/Z) is
generated by the classes of complete intersection curves on the irre-
ducible divisors of X which are partially supported on the ﬁbres of f .
More precisely, if F is such an irreducible divisor, the corresponding
classes are of the form11: F.An−r−1.Br−1, if f (F ) := E, dim(E) = r ≥
1, and if A is ample on X, B = f ∗(BE), BE ample on E.

For any smooth12 irreducible subvariety Y on X, we have natural
inclusion maps N1(Y /Z) → N1(Y ) → N1(X), where N1(Y /Z) denotes
the Kernel of the composition maps N1(Y ) → N1(X) → N1(Z). In
general, of course, Mov(Y /Z) := Mov(Y ) ∩ N1(Y /Z) is not contained
in Mov(X/Z). This is, however, the case if, for example, Y = Xy =
f −1(z), z ∈ Z is a ‘general’ ﬁbre of f , in the following sense.
Deﬁnition 3.2. A point z ∈ Z of an irreducible complex space Z is
‘general’ if it lies in the complement of countably many speciﬁed strict
Zariski closed subsets of Z, a ﬁbre Xz of f : X → Z is ‘general’ if it
lies over a ‘general’ point of z ∈ Z.
Proposition 3.3. Let f : X → Z be as above. For z ∈ Z ‘general’, the
natural inclusion map j : Xz → X induces an isomorphim of real vector
spaces j∗ : N1(Xz) → N 0
1 (X/Z), as well as bijections j∗ : Mov(Xz) →
Mov(X/Z), and j∗ : Mov0(Xz) → Mov0(X/Z). For such a z, we can
thus deﬁne a natural restriction map: (j∗)−1 : Mov(X/Z) → Mov(Xz).
For each divisor F on X, and each α ∈ Mov(X/Z), we have further:
α.F = αz.Fz, for αz := (j∗)−1(α), anf Fz := j∗(F ).

Proof. Let C1(X/Z) be the Chow-Barlet space of 1-dimensional alge-
braic cycles Γ ⊂ X such that f∗(Γ) = 0, that is: which are con-
tained in some ﬁbre of f . The space C1(X/Z) has countably many
irreducible components Tm, which are compact (ie: projective), and
which parametrise an irreducible curve Ct, t ∈ Tm generic. The sup-
port Xm of Tm, which is the union of all curves Ct parametrised by Tm,
is thus a Zariski-closed subset of X. Let Zm := f (Xm),∀m. We now
consider only the T ′
ms such that Xm = f −1(Zm), and deﬁne a point
z ∈ Z to be general if it does not belong to any of the Zm such that
Zm = Z. For such a point z, if [C] is the class of an irreducible curve C
contained in Xz, one thus has the equivalence between the two proper-
ties: C moves in a Z-covering algebraic family of curves, and: C moves
in an X-covering family of curves such that f∗([C]) = 0.

11F.An−2 if r = 0.
12One can of course compose with a desingularisation of Y , also.

14

FRÉDÉRIC CAMPANA AND MIHAI PĂUN

This shows, for such a z, the existence and surjectivity of the map
j∗ : Mov0(Xz) → Mov0(X/Z), and thus also the surjectivity of j∗ :
N1(Xz) → N1(X/Z). In order to show the injectivity of this last map,
we only need to show, by transposition, the surjectivity of the dual re-
striction map: j∗ : N 1(X/Z) := (N 1(X)/(f ∗(N 1(Z)) + P )) → N 1(Xz),
where P ⊂ N 1(X) is the vector space generated by irreducible divi-
sors partially suported on ﬁbres of f . This is achieved by the same
argument as before, but applied to f -relative divisors on X. One how-
ever possibly needs in the process to suppress countably many new
Zariski-closed subsets of Z.

For such a ‘general’ z ∈ Z, the map j∗ : N1(Xz) → N 0

1 (X/Z)
is thus linear bijective, hence homeomorphic. The induced map j∗ :
Mov0(Xz) → Mov0(X/Z) is thus bijective, and so is j∗ : Mov(Xz) →
Mov(X/Z). The last assertion is then obvious, since true for any curve
contained in a ﬁbre of Xz.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 3.4. A movable class on a smooth connected complex man-
ifold X is said to be ‘big’ if it lies in the interior of the movable cone
of X.
Deﬁnition 3.5. Let f : X → Z be a ﬁbration as before. A class
α ∈ Mov(X/Z) is said to be ‘big on the general ﬁbre’ if its restriction
(j∗)−1(α) := αz is ‘big’ in Xz for z ∈ Z ‘general’. We shall denote this
simply by: αz is ‘big’ (z ∈ Z being implicitly assumed to be ‘general’).
In this context, we have the following statement.
Proposition 3.6. Let f : X → Z be as above, with n := dim(X), d :=
n− dim(Z). Let A, B be very ample divisors on X and Z, respectively,
with BX := f ∗(B). Let α ∈ Mov0(X/Z), and F := ∪s∈SFs be an
eﬀective reduced divisor on X, partially supported on the ﬁbres of f .

X ∈ Mov0(X/Z).

1. Ad−1.Bn−d
2. N 0
1 (X/Z) is generated as a real vector space by classes: Ad−1.Bn−d.
If β ∈ N1(X/Z), we write α ≥ β to mean that α − β ∈ Mov(X/Z).
3. There exists ε > 0 such that α ≥ ε.Ad−1.Bn−d
4. For any ϑ ∈ N 0
5. For any set of given reals bs, s ∈ S, there exists ϑ ∈ N1(X/Z)
6. Let β ∈ Mov(Z). There exists β′ ∈ Mov(X) such that:
f∗(β′) = β, and moreover: β′.Fs = 0,∀s ∈ S.

1 (X/Z), k.α ≥ ϑ,∀k ≥ k0, for some k0 ∈ R.

such that ϑ.Fs = bs,∀s ∈ S.

Proof. The assertion 1 is clear because complete intersections of ample
divisor classes of Xz are big on Xz.

2 follows immediately from [16], Proposition 6.5, which states that
the set of classes of the form (Az)d−1, with Az an ample divisor on Xz
is open in N1(Xz).

If αz is big, Mov0(Xz being open contains αz−ε.Ad−1.Bn−d for some

ε > 0. Hence 3, and 4, by the same argument applied to ϑ.

15

We now prove Claim 5, which is more involved. Write BX := f ∗(B).
Let thus Fs be given. Deﬁne the class ϑs := Fs.Ad−1.Bn−d−1
∈
N1(X/Z), by choosing a suitable representative of this class, one sees
that it is a movable class of N1(Fs/Es).

X

Moreover, it is easy to see also that we the orthogonality relations:

ϑs.Fs′ = 0 = ϑs′.Fs, unless Es = Es′.

X

The real numbers bs being given, we will look for real numbers ts

such that ϑ := Ps∈S ts.ϑs, with the property that ϑ.Fs = bs,∀s ∈ S.
By the orthogonality relations above, we just need to determine these
real numbers in the case where f (Fs) = Es = E is the same E, for
all s ∈ S. But in this case we can even reduce to: X is the surface
X ′ cut out by (suﬃciently generic and large multiple of) Ad−1.Bn−d−1
,
and mapped by f to the curve Z ′ := Bn−d−1. In this case, because F is
partially supported on the ﬁbres of f , the same is true of F ′ := F ∩ X ′
over Z ′. In this case, the assertion is a consequence of the ‘negativity
lemma’ on quadratic forms of [3], Lemma 2.10, p. 19. This lemma
indeed says that if g : S → B is a projective connected morphism from
a smooth connected surface onto a curve with ﬁbre Sb := g∗(b), b ∈ B,
the intersection matrix of the components of Sb is semi-negative with
Kernel Sb, which implies that it is strictly negative on the vector space
generated by the components of any curve C ⊂ Sb with support strictly
contained in Sb.
We now prove assertion 6. Remark ﬁrst that any β ∈ Mov(Z) can
be lifted to a β” ∈ Mov(X) such that f∗(β”) = β. This is clear
if β = [Ct] is the class of an algebraic irreducible family of curves
(Ct),t∈T of Z which is Z-covering: one just need to choose, for example:
β” := [A]d−1.[f −1(Ct)], for t ∈ T generic. This construction extends
linearly (and thus continuously) to any β ∈ Mov(Z).
Let us now consider an arbitrary irreducible divisor E ⊂ Z. Let
f ∗(E) =Pk∈K ck.Fk+G′, where G′ is an eﬀective f -exceptional divisor,
while f (Fk) = E, and ck > 0,∀k ∈ K. Let us write: K = J ∪ L, for
some (possibly empty)J ⊂ K, and some (nonempty) L ⊂ K, where
J := (K ∩ S) is the set of indices for the components of f ∗(E) which
are contained in the divisor F which is ‘partially supported on the
ﬁbres of f ’.

X

Let, as above, ϑk := Fk.Ad−1.Bn−d−1

, for any k ∈ K. We obviously
have: f∗(ϑk) = 0,∀k ∈ K. We shall chose β′ := β” + ϑ, with ϑ :=
Pk∈J νk.ϑk. Because of the orthogonality relations mentioned above,
β′.G = β”.G for any f -vertical divisor G not mapped onto E by f .
In order to have β′ movable, together with β′.Fs = 0,∀s ∈ S, we thus
only need to check the existence and non-negativity of the solutions
νk, k ∈ J of the equations: −(Pk∈J νk.ϑ).Fj = β”.Fj ≥ 0,∀j ∈ J.
Indeed, the non-negatitivity of these coeﬃcients νk then implies that
β′.H ≥ β”.H for any divisor H on X diferent from any of the F ′
js,
which gives the movability of β′. By the negativity lemma above, we

16

FRÉDÉRIC CAMPANA AND MIHAI PĂUN

have the uniqueness and existence of the solutions νk, k ∈ J. Now the
non-negativity of all the ν′
ks simultaneously is precisely the assertion
of the (elementary but crucial) [20], Corollary 4.2, pp. 112-113.

This solves the problem for the divisors Fs which are not f -exceptional.

Let now Fs be an f -exceptional divisor, with T := f (Fs) of codimen-
sion 2 at least in Z. Let F ′ := ∪s′∈S ′⊂S be a connected component of
the codimension 1 locus of f −1(T ). Let t := dim(T ) ≥ 0, andBT :=
f ∗(B|T ). We then deal with F ′ exactly as before with ∪k∈J Fk, just
replacing the surface X ′
if
t ≥ 1, and by XT := An−2 if t = 0, and the classes ϑs by the classes
ϑs′ := Fs′.XT . The same negativity lemmas then apply.

4. Positivity of minimal slope

The following criteria will be crucial in the proof of Theorem 1.2 in
the next section. We start with a basic situation which will be gradually
extended in several small steps.

Let τ : T → W ′ be a ﬁbration (with connected ﬁbres) between
complex projective connected normal spaces Let r : R → T and s :
W ” → W be resolutions of singularities.

The corresponding diagram is thus the following:

R r

/ T

ρ

/ Y

τ

W ”

s

/ W ′

Assume we have moreover movable classes αR, βR on R, and β” on

W ” such that: (τ ◦ r)∗(αR) = 0, and (τ ◦ r)∗(βR) = s∗(β”).

Let also an exact sequence of locally free sheaves be given on R:

0 → F → E → (τ ◦ r)∗(G) → 0,

where G is locally free on W ′.
4.1. First Criterion.

Theorem 4.1. In the preceding situation, we have: µγR,min(E) > 0 if
γR := k.αR + βR, for any real number k > 0 suﬃciently large, and if
moreover, the following properties are satisﬁed:
1. µαR,min(F ) > 0, µβ”,min(s∗(G)) > 0, and:
2. αR is ‘big’ on the ‘general’ ﬁbre Rw′ of τ ◦ r (see deﬁnitions 3.4

and 3.2).

Proof. (of Theorem 4.1) Let Q be a quotient of E: it ﬁts in an exact
sequence:

0 → QF → Q → QG → 0,

/


/
/
17

with QF and QG quotients of F and G respectively. Let γR := k.αR+βR
for some k > 0. Then µγR(Q) is a linear combination with positive
coeﬃcients of µγR(QF ) and µγR(QG).

We shall treat them separately.

Lemma 4.2. For k > 0 suﬃciently large, µγR(QF ) = k.µαR(QF ) +
−µβR,max(F )
µβR(QF ) > 0. Explicitely, one may choose any k > k0 :=
µαR ,min(F ) .
Proof. Indeed, by assumption, µαR(QF ) ≥ µαR,min(F ) > 0 for any such
QF .

(cid:3)

The main observation is the following

Lemma 4.3. Either det(QG) ≥ (τ ◦ r)∗(det(Q′
G)) for some sheaf Q′
on W , or det(QG) is an eﬀective non-zero divisor when restricted to a
generic ﬁbre of (τ ◦ r) : R → W . (The symbol A ≤ B between divisors
means that B − A is eﬀective).

G

(cid:3)

Before proving this lemma, let us show that it implies Theorem 4.1:
in the ﬁrst case, we have: det(QG) = (τ ◦ r)∗(det(Q′
G)), and thus
µαR(QG) = 0, since (τ ◦ r)∗(αR) = 0. Hence: µγR(QG) = µβR(QG) ≥
µβR,min(G) > 0. In the second case, we have, by the bigness of αR on
the ﬁbres of τ ◦r, and the fact that (τ ◦r)∗(αR) = 0: µαR(det(QG)) > 0.
Thus µk.αR+βR(QG) > 0 if k > 0 is suﬃciently large (once Q is chosen
to minimise µβR among quotients of E).
Proof. (of lemma 4.3) It is equivalent to the dual statement. Let thus
M ⊂ (τ ◦ r)∗(G) be a subsheaf of rank t > 0, and let t′ ≤ t be the rank
of the direct image sheaf M′ := (τ ◦ r)∗(M). If t = t′, we are in the
ﬁrst case, and in the second case if t′ < t. Indeed:
in the ﬁrst case,
((τ ◦r)∗(M′)sat/M) is torsion, and ((τ ◦r)∗(M′))sat = (τ ◦r)∗((M′)sat),
the saturations being taken in (τ ◦ r)∗(G) and in G respectively. We
thus have: det(M) ≤ (τ ◦ r)∗(det(M′)sat) in this case.
In the second case, we consider the natural rational map ϕ : R →
(τ ◦r)∗(Grass(t,G)), which we may assume to be regular (by modifying
suitably R). The property t′ < t means that the image of the generic ﬁ-
bre Rw of τ ◦ r by ϕ is positive-dimensional. We have: QG = ϕ∗(Univ),
and thus det(QG) = ϕ∗(det(Univ)), if Univ → Grass(t,G) is the uni-
versal bundle of rank t on Grass(t,G). The assertion in this second
case thus immediately follows from the fact that det(Univ) is ample on
the ﬁbres of Grass(t,G) → W , and that the ﬁbres of ϕ(R) over W are
positive-dimensional.

(cid:3)

4.2. Case of a non-saturated quotient. We now consider the same
situation R, T, Y, W, W ”, αR, βR, β,F ,E,G as before, but assume in-
stead that the exact sequence we have is:

0 → F → E → H → 0,

r)(F ) ( W . In particular, we thus have: αR.det(QH) = αR.(det(QG))
if QH ⊂ QG are quotients of (τ ◦ r)∗(G) such that the cokernel has
support in F . We get the following strengthening of Theorem 4.1,
under an additional condition on βR:

Corollary 4.4. Assume that βR = β′
R + k′αR, where k′ > 0 is real, and
β′
R.Fj = 0, for any component Fj of F . The conclusion of Theorem 4.1
then still holds for E. (ie: µk.αR+βR,min(E) > 0 if k > 0 is suﬃciently
large).
Proof. Any quotient of H injects into a quotient of G, with cokernel
with support in F . The determinants of these quotients thus diﬀer by
a divisor supported on F , which has the same intersection with βR and
β′
R by assumption made that (τ ◦ r)(F ) ( W .

We assume here that both π : Y → X, and p : W → Z are ﬁnite,
Galois, of groups G and H respectively, and that T is a component
of the normalisation of Y ×Z W , with projections ρ : T → Y and
σ : T → W . Thus T is naturally L-Galois, equipped with an action of
L ⊂ G×H such that ρ is ﬁnite, Galois, with group H ′ ⊂ H. Notice that
L is surjective on both G and H, since T surjects ﬁnitely on both Y and
XW := X ×Z W , which is irreducible because so are the generic ﬁbres
of f , and so also those of fW : XW → W , so that every component of:
Y ×Z W = Y ×X (X ×Z W ) = Y ×X XW projects surjectively, not only
on Y , but also on XW .
The composition σ = p′ ◦ τ of the diagram is the Stein factorisation
of σ, with τ connected and p′ Galois, ﬁnite, of group G′, the kernel of
the natural projection L → G′, also the subgroup of G preserving the
ﬁbres of τ .
We assume that r is an L-equivariant resolution of T , and that s is

a G′-equivariant resolution of W ′.

We then also consider locally free sheaves E on Y and G on W , E
(resp. G) being G-invariant (resp. H-invariant). Their liftings to R
will be denoted by ER and GR, respectively.
We moreover assume that there exists an L-equivariant sheaf mor-
phism ∆ : ER → GR with image H ⊂ GR such that the quotient
GR/H is torsion on R, with (L-invariant) support contained in a di-
visor FR = (π ◦ ρ ◦ r)−1(F ), F ⊂ X a divisor such that f (F ) ( Z.

Since ∆ is L-equivariant, we see that FR := Ker(∆) = (π ◦ ρ ◦ r)∗(F ),
for some G-invariant subsheaf F ⊂ E.
We assume moreover that we have movable classes α, β′ on X, and
β on Z such that:

1. f∗(α) = 0, f∗(β′) = β.
2. α is ‘big’ on the general ﬁbre Xz of f .
3. There exists k > 0 such that β′ = β” + k.α, where β” is movable,

and β”.Fj = 0, for every component Fj of F .

αY ,min(F ) > 0.
βW ,min(G) > 0.

4. µG
5. µH
Here αY , βW denote the liftings to Y and W of α and β respectively.
(We adopt this notation for liftings, whenever deﬁned, to any space in
the diagram using the given maps. For example: β′
Y := π∗(β′), but β′
Y
is not the lifting of β in any natural sense).

The equivariant version we shall need is the following:

Corollary 4.5. In the above situation, and under the above hypothesis,
we have, for any suﬃciently large real number k > 0: µγ,min(E) > 0, if
γ := k.αY + βY .

Proof. It mainly consists in lifting up and down the classes α, β′, β, and
checking the above properties 1,2,3,4,5, together with the equivariance
conditions at the levels of R, T, Y, W ′, and in applying the arguments
of Theorems 4.1 and corollary 4.4, in order to get the conclusion.

Lemma 4.6. The properties 1,2,3 above imply:

w → Xz, z := (p ◦ p′)(w′) is generically
ﬁnite, and αR on this ﬁbre Rw′ is by deﬁnition, the lifting of α on Xz.
This proves the assertion.

We denote by FR,ER,HR,GW ” the liftings of F ,E,G,H to R, R, R

αR,min(FR) = µG

βW ”,min(GW ”) = µH

αY ,min(E)

We can thus lift everything to R, and work there, using the same
hypothesis for their liftings as for α, β, β′, β”, just taking into account
the L-equivariance properties.

Let thus Q be a G× H quotient of ER. It ﬁts into an exact sequence

QF → Q → QH → 0,

for G × H-invariant sequence of sheaves induced by (ρ ◦ r)∗(∆), which
is an equivariant map of sheaves on R (since ∆ is G-equivariant).
The same argument as in Lemma 4.2 shows that for some explicit

of E = π∗(T (X, D)) relative to π∗(α). We assume that the associated
ﬁbration has f as ‘neat’ birational model.
Let T be a component of the normalisation of Y ×Z W , together with
the projections ρ : T → Y and σ : T → W , so that L ⊂ G×H naturally
acts on T . We take further an L-equivariant resolution r : R → T of

the preceding section.

21

Let G := (σ ◦ r)∗(p∗(T (Z, DZ))), and ∆ := (ρ ◦ r)∗(π∗(df )) : E → G:
this is an L-equivariant map by construction, its existence is garanteed
by Proposition 2.11. Let H := [∆(E)], we thus have an inclusion H ⊂
G, and an exact sequence:

0 → F → E → H → 0.

Moreover, the cokernel sheaf G/H is torsion, with support in a divisor
F ⊂ X ‘partially supported on ﬁbres of f ’ (See Deﬁnition 2.12). This
property permits to show, by Proposition 3.6.(6), the existence of a
movable class β” := βX on X such that β”.Fj = 0 for all components
Fj of F , and to obtain from Corollary 4.5:
Theorem 4.7. In the preceding situation, assume also that µG
αY (F ) >
0, that µp∗(β),min(p∗(T (Z, DZ))) > 0, and that α is ‘big’ on the ‘general’
ﬁbre of f . Then k.α + βX := γ satisﬁes: µπ∗(γ),min(π∗(T (X, D))) > 0,
for any suﬃciently large k > 0 .

5. Harder-Narasimhan filtrations for orbifold bundles

In this section, we establish the fact that the ﬁbration on X con-
structed in [11] from an orbifold foliation of positive minimal slope
relatively to a movable class α on X depends only on the orbifold
pair (X, D) and α, and not on the Kawamata cover used to deﬁne it,
and that moreover it is preserved under orbifold birational equivalence.
These results are natural complements of those in [11]. The arguments
lead to more general statements however.

We refer to [9] and [11] for the deﬁnitions and basic properties of
slope, (semi-)stability, and Harder Narasimhan ﬁltration of a (reﬂexive)
sheaf E, relative to a movable class α on a projective manifold. We used
in [11] the following notion:
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let π : Y → X be a generically ﬁnite morphism
between two complex connected projective manifolds, which is Galois for
a certain ﬁnite group G (which acts eﬀectively and transitively on the
generic ﬁbres of g). Let α be a movable class on X. Then π∗(α) is still
π∗(α),min(π∗(E)) as the minimum
a movable class on Y , and we deﬁne: µG
of the π∗(α)-slopes of the non-zero G-invariant quotients of π∗(E). We
can deﬁne similarly the G-maximal destabilising subsheaf and the G-
Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltration of π∗(E) relative to π∗(α), which will be
written as: HN G
Lemma 5.2. Let g : X ′ → X be a surjective morphism between normal
irreducible complex projective spaces. Let E be a reﬂexive coherent sheaf
on X, and F ′ ⊂ g∗(E) be a saturated subsheaf. Denoting with (.)sat the
saturation inside g∗(E), we have: :

1. F ′ = g∗(F )sat with F := g∗(F ′) if g is birational.
2. F ′ = g∗(F )sat if F = (g∗(F ′))G if g is ﬁnite, Galois of group G,
and if F ′ is preserved by the action of G on g∗(E). Here (g∗(F ′))G is

π∗(α)(π∗(E)).

22

FRÉDÉRIC CAMPANA AND MIHAI PĂUN

the subsheaf of g∗(g∗(E)) = E generated by the presheaf of G-invariant
sections of F ′ deﬁned on open sets of X ′ of the form g−1(U), U ⊂ X
open. Moreover, the support of (g∗(F )sat/g∗(F )) is contained in the
codimension at least 2 subset S := g−1(Sing(X) ∪ g(Sing(X ′))) of X ′.
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that g is birational.

The evaluation map v : g∗(g∗(F ′)) → F is then isomorphic over the
generic point of X, and F := g∗(F ′) ⊂ E := g∗(g∗(E))G. Since F ′ is
saturated in g∗(E), we obtain the given isomorphism.
Assume now that we are in the second situation. By its deﬁnition,
the sheaf F := (g∗(F ′))G ⊂ E is generated locally by sections of the
N .(Ph∈G h∗(s′)), for s′ a local section of F ′. Thus it is locally
form s := 1
of ﬁnite type, and hence coherent as an OX -module.From the ﬂatness
of g outside of S, we deduce that F ′ = g∗(F ) = g∗(F )sat there. We
conclude using the evaluation map v : g∗(F ) → F ′.
Corollary 5.3. Assume that g : X ′ → X is as above, with X, X ′
smooth. Assume that g = h◦ k, with h : Y → X ﬁnite, Galois, of group
G, and k : X ′ → Y birational and G-equivariant. Let α be a movable
class on X, and g∗(α) := α′ be its inverse image on X ′. Let E be a
reﬂexive sheaf on X. Then µα,min(E) = µG
α′,min(g∗(E)), and the g∗(α)-
maximal destabilising sheaf F ′ of g∗(E) is equal to g∗(F )sat, where F
is the α-maximal destabilising sheaf of E for α. More generally, the
g∗(α)(g∗(E)) is equal to the saturation
Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltration HN G
of g∗(HNα(E)) in g∗(E), with equality of corresponding slopes.
Proof. Let F ′ ⊂ g∗(E) be any G-invariant saturated subsheaf. De-
ﬁne FY := k∗(F ′)sat (saturation in h∗(E) here), and F := h∗(FY ) =
h∗(FY )sat. All of these sheaves are G-invariant. From the preceding
lemma, we obtain that F ′ = g∗(F )sat. Hence, using the last assertion
of the preceding lemma, we obtain: det(F ′) = g∗(det(F ))+E, where E
is a g-exceptional divisor on X ′ (i.e: all of its components are mapped
in codimension at least 2 in X by g). Thus: g∗(α).det(F ′) = α.det(F ),
since g∗(α).E = 0.
If we apply this to the g∗(α)-maximal destabilising G-subsheaf F ′ of
g∗(E), we obtain that F ′ = g∗(F )sat, if F is the α-maximal destabilis-
ing subsheaf of E. The statements concerning the Harder-Narasimhan
ﬁltrations, the slopes, and µG

g∗(α),min(g∗(E)) follow immediately.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

We shall need a slight generalisation, too:

Corollary 5.4. Let g : X ′ → X, G, Y,E,E ′ = g∗(E), α be as above. Let
moreover h′ : X” → X ′ be birational, G-equivariant, with X” smooth.
Let E” ⊂ (g ◦ h′)∗(E) := (h′)∗(E ′) be a reﬂexive G-invariant subsheaf
such that the support of ((h′)∗(E ′)/E”) is contained in the exceptional
divisor of h′. The conclusions of the preceding corollary then hold for
E” and α” := (g ◦ h′)∗(α) in place of g∗(E) and g∗(α). More precisely,

23

(g◦h′)∗(α)(E”)) = (g ◦ h′)∗((HNα(E))sat)∩E”, with equality

we have: HN G
of corresponding slopes.
Proof. The conclusions of the preceding lemma apply to (g ◦ h′)∗(E).
The (g ◦ h′)∗(α)-maximal destabilising G-subsheaf F ” of E” is the in-
tersection with E” of the (g ◦ h′)∗(α)-maximal destabilising G-subsheaf
F + of (g ◦ h′)∗(E)), and so its (g ◦ h′)∗(α)-slope is the same as the one
of F +, by the assumption on the support of ((h′)∗(E ′)/E”). The other
assertions follow immediately.

5.1. Independence of the adapted cover. Let (X, D) be, as always
here, a smooth projective orbifold pair, and let π : Y → X a Kawamata
cover (see [11],§.5) adapted to (X, D). Recall that Y is smooth, π G-
Galois, Kummer and ﬁnite, for some Abelian group G. Moreover, the
locally free sheaves π∗(T (X, D)) and its dual π∗(Ω1(X, D)) are deﬁned
on Y . More precisely, if D = Pj cj.Dj, with cj = aj
as above, then
π ramiﬁes to a certain order m > 0, divisible by each of the b′
js over
Supp(D) = ∪jDj (and also over some additional components H needed
to construct π globally).
π∗(α)(π∗(T (X, D))),
and it is proved in [11], that the saturation HN G
π∗(α)(π∗(T (X, D)))sat
inside π∗(T X) is of the form π∗(W •(D, α, π)) for a certain ﬁltration
W • on T X (which is, of course, not HNα(T X) in general, if D 6= 0).
Our aim here is to prove that the ﬁltration W •(D, α, π) is in fact13
independent of the adapted cover π and that it only depends on D
and α. It will thus simply be written as W •(D, α) in the sequel. This
π∗(α)(π∗(T (X, D)) by simply
permits, once π is given, to reconstruct HN G
intersecting π∗(W •(D, α)) with π∗(T (X, D)).

Let α be a movable class on X, we thus get HN G

So we consider a second Kawamata cover π′ : Y ′ → X adapted to

(X, D), of group G′ = Gal(Y ′/X). Let

Z ⊂ (Y ′ ×X Y )n

be any component of the normalisation of ﬁbered product, together
with the natural projections q : Z → X, p : Z → Y and p′ : Z → Y ′. it
is acted on by its normal stabilizer L ⊂ G′ × G, which is onto on both
G and G′. Indeed: Z is surjective and ﬁnite on both Y ′ and Y , which
are irreducible. Moreover, q is L Galois. The projections p and p′ are
respectively H ′-Galois (resp. H-Galois) for some subgroups H ′ (resp.
H) of G′ (resp. G). The components of (Y ×Z W )n are exchanged
under the action of (G × G′)/L.
Let ﬁnally r : Z ′ → Z be an L-equivariant resolution of Z. Let
q := π ◦ p ◦ r = π′ ◦ p′ ◦ r.

13In accordance with the ‘orbifold’ nature of these notions.

Theorem 5.5. We have:

1. p′∗(π′∗(T (X, D))) = p∗(π∗(T (X, D))) := T .
2. HN L

π∗(α)(π∗(T (X, D))))sat =

tions.
Proof. The ﬁrst equality is easily computed outside of S ⊂ X consisting
of the union of Sing(Supp(D)) and of the intersection of Supp(D) with
the union of all the additional components H of the ramiﬁcation loci
of π and π′, since it just consist in liftinging ‘fractional’ vector ﬁelds of
the form xc.∂x, c ∈ Q∩]0, 1], under maps x = zm.m′ = zm′m for integers
m, m′ such that mc and m′c are integers. Since both π∗(T (X, D)) and
π∗(T (X, D)) are locally free, this equality extends to Z, and then to
Z ′.

The last two statements are then immediate applications of Corollary
(cid:3)

5.3.

Corollary 5.6. For given (X, D), π, G and α as above, the ﬁltration
W •(D, α) on T X such that π∗(W •(D, α)) = HN G
π∗(α)(π∗(T (X, D)))sat,
the saturation being in π∗(T X), is independent on π.
Proof. Indeed, for r, π′, p′, p as above, the saturations in (π◦p◦r)∗(T X)
of (p◦r)∗(HN G
π′∗(α)(π′∗(T (X, D))))
coincide with that of HN L
(cid:3)

π∗(α)(π∗(T (X, D)))) and (p′◦r)∗(HN G′

q∗(α)(T ).

Assume now that α.(KX + D) < 0. Let F ⊂ π∗(T (X, D)) be the
maximal destabilising G-subsheaf: it has a positive α-slope. It is proved
in [11] that its saturation in π∗(T X) is of the form π∗(FX) for some
algebraic foliation FX on X, with FX = Ker(df ) for some rational
ﬁbration f : X 99K Z. From Corollary 5.6, we obtain:
Corollary 5.7. The foliation FX and the ﬁbration f (up to birational
equivalence) depend on D and α, but not on π.

5.2. Birational orbifold invariance. We shall apply the preceding
Proposition 2.11 together with the Corollary 5.4 in order to show the
birational orbifold invariance of the equivariant Harder-Narasimhan
ﬁltration of π∗(T (X, D)) relative to a movable class α.

The situation is the following: Let f (X ′, D′) → (X, D) be a bira-
tional orbifold morphism between smooth projective complex orbifold
pairs. We thus have, in particular: f∗(D′) = D.

Let π : Y → (X, D) and π′ : Y ′ → (X ′, D′) be adapted Kawamata-
covers of groups G, G′. We consider, as before, an irreducible compo-
nent T ⊂ (Y ′ ×X Y )n of its normalised ﬁbre-product (Y ′ ×X Y )n over
X, together with its projections ρ : T → Y and ρ′ : T → Y ′. We have
a natural action of L ⊂ G′ × G on T . We also choose an L-equivariant
resolution of singularities r : R → T for this action.

25

Deﬁne two locally-free sheaves E ′ := (ρ′ ◦ r)∗((π′)∗(T (X ′, D′))) and
E := (ρ ◦ r)∗((π)∗(T (X, D))) on R. By the previous Proposition 2.11,
we get a sheaf homomorphism (π′ ◦ ρ′ ◦ r)∗(df ) : E ′ → E, since f is an
orbifold morphism.
Lemma 5.8. The cokernel of (π′ ◦ ρ′ ◦ r)∗(df ) : E ′ → E is contained in
the exceptional divisor of (ρ ◦ r) : R → Y .
Proof. This follows from the fact that f∗(D′) = D by the same argu-
ment used to prove Theorem 5.5, which shows that the sheaves E and
E ′ coincide in codimension one outside of the inverse image in R of the
exceptional divisor of f in X ′.

(cid:3)

Applying now Corollary 5.4 to E ′,E and to ρ ◦ r : T → Y , writing

π∗(α)(π∗(T (X, D)))]sat

h = (f ◦ π′ ◦ ρ′ ◦ r) = (π ◦ ρ ◦ r) : R → X, we get:
Proposition 5.9. Let f : (X ′, D′) → (X, D) be an orbifold birational
morphism as above. Then, taking saturation inside E, we have:
[(ρ′◦r)∗(HN G′

(f ◦π′)∗(α)(π′∗(T (X ′, D′)))]sat = [(ρ◦r)∗(HN G

We now have two ﬁltrations W •(D, α)) on T X and W •(D′, α′) on
T X ′, with α′ := f ∗(α)), obtained by descending the Galois-invariant
Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltrations of π′∗(T (X ′, D′)) relative to (f ◦ π′)∗(α),
and similarly for (X, D) and π∗(α). See Theorem 5.5 and Corollary 5.6

Corollary 5.10. The situation being the same as in 5.9, we have:
W •(D′, α′) = [f ∗(W •(D, α)] ∩ T X ′.

In other words: these ﬁltrations are birationally invariant and inde-
pendent on the Kawamata-covers, with respect to liftings of the given
movable class.
Remark 5.11. When a ﬁbration f : (X, D) → (Z, DZ) (possibly bira-
tional) is given, together with a Kawamata cover p : W → Z adapted
to (Z, DZ), it is always possible to construct, after suitable blow-ups
of (X, D), some (X ′, D′), and a Kawamata cover π′ : Y ′ → (X ′, D′)
adpated to D′, such that one has a regular map f ′ : Y ′ → W with:
f ◦ π′ = p′ ◦ f ′ : X ′ → Z. This permits to simplify the diagrams to
come, by choosing R = T = Y ′, but at the (small) expense of not taking
an arbitrary π : Y → (X, D).

6. Proof of Theorem 1.2

Before starting the proof, let us observe that the 3 properties of
the statement are ‘up’-birationally invariant14 in the sense that if they
hold on (X, D), they also hold on (X ′, D′) for any birational f : X ′ →
X which induces an orbifold morphism f : (X ′, D′) → (X, D) (see
Deﬁnition 2.1), the movable classes involved being always the inverse
images of the initial ones.

14 ‘Up’ because this works under blow-ups, not under blow-downs in general.

The elements of H 0(Z, (KZ + DZ)⊗m ⊗ B)) lift injectively to R as
inverse images of G-invariant elements of H 0(Y, Symm(π∗(Ω1(X, D)))⊗
π∗(f ∗(B))). As all of these last ones vanish by assumption, so do the
ﬁrst ones. But this means precisely that (KZ + DZ) is not pseudo-
eﬀective.

• 1 =⇒ 3. This is the actual content of Theorem 1.2, and its most
involved part, requiring the preliminaries above. The proof will work
by induction on n := dim(X).

We start with n = 1, so that X is a curve, KX + D is not pseudo
eﬀective, and there is only one non-zero movable class α up to non-
zero homothety. Then π∗(Ω1(X, D)) = π∗(KX + D), and clearly:
µα,min(π∗(X, D)) = −d.α.(KX + D) > 0, if d > 0 is the geometric
degree of π.
We thus assume that n ≥ 2, and that the implication 1 =⇒ 3 holds
We shall produce a ﬁbration f : (X, D) → (Z, DZ) with dim(Z) > 0,
together with suitable classes α ∈ Mov0(X/Z) and β ∈ Mov0(Z) and
βX ∈ Mov(X) such that f∗(βX ) = β, so as to be in position to apply
the results in §.4.4 to conclude that γ := k.α +βX satisﬁes the property
µπ∗(γ),min(T (X, D)) > 0 if k > 0 is suﬃciently large.

whenever dim(X) < n.

We assume that π : Y → X is a Kawamata cover adapted to (X, D).
Let α ∈ Mov(X) be any class such that α.(KX + D) < 0. Let F ⊂
π∗(T (X, D)) be the (G-invariant) α-maximal destabilising subsheaf.
It deﬁnes (by [11]) a rational ﬁbration f0 : X0 99K Z0 with FX0 =
Ker(df0), where π∗(FX0) = F sat, the saturation inside π∗(T X). We
write here X0 = X, Z0 = Z, because we shall now consider (new)

suitable birational models X, Z of X0, Z0. Moreover, this ﬁbration is
non-trivial: dim(Z) < n. We put d := n − dim(Z) > 0.
We now chose a (new) ‘neat’ birational model f : (X, D) → (Z, DZ)
of our original f0 : X0 99K Z0, and a corresponding Kawamata cover
of (X, D). By Proposition 5.9, the G-invariant Harder-Narasimhan
ﬁbration of the new orbifold cotangent sheaf is the inverse image of the
initial one. We can thus assume from the very beginning that f was a
‘strictly’ neat orbifold morphism, in the sense that it is neat, and that,
moreover, any f -exceptional divisor F ⊂ X is u-exceptional for the
birational map u : X → X0, and α = u∗(α0). This ‘strictness’ property
is obtained by ﬁrst ﬂattenning the map f0.
Moreover, we have (using the notations of [11]): 0 > −α.(det(F )) =
α.(KX/Z + Dhor − D(f )), so that KXz + Dz := (KX/Z + D)|Xz is not
pseudo-eﬀective for z ∈ Z generic. There thus exists α′ ∈ Mov0(X/Z)
such that α′.(KX/Z + D) < 0. Let us choose any of these. Let F ′ ⊂
π∗(T (X, D)) be the (G-invariant) α′-maximal destabilising subsheaf.

Lemma 6.1. In this situation, we have:

1. F ′ ⊂ F .
2. F ′ is an orbifold foliation on (X, D). It is thus algebraic, too.

Proof. 1. Since F = Ker(π∗(df ) : π∗(T (X, D)) → (f ◦ π)∗(T Z)),
it is suﬃcient to show that Hom(F ′, (f ◦ π)∗(T Z)) = 0, and thus,
that µα′,min(F ′) = µα′(F ′) > µα′,max((f ◦ π)∗(T Z)). By assumption,
µα′(F ′) > 0, since α′.(KX/Z + D) < 0, and F ′ is the maximal α′-
destabilizing subsheaf. On the other hand, , since f∗(α′) = 0, we have:
µα′,max(f ◦ π)∗(T Z) ≤ 0, by Lemma 4.3, since the image of F ′, if
nonzero, were a subsheaf of (f ◦ π)∗(T Z), and should be, either gener-
ically coming from from T Z, or having an anti-eﬀective determinant
along the ﬁbres of τ .

2. The fact that F ′ is an (X, D)-foliation in the sense of [11] is the
usual slope-argument (going back to Y. Miyaoka), since F ′ is maximal-
destabilizing with positive slope. The algebraicity statement is one of
the main results of [11].
(cid:3)

The two consequences below are immediate.

In the following, we
implicitely assume that we consider all birational models of (X, D),
and lift α to them.
Corollary 6.2. Assume dα := d is minimal among all dα, α ∈ Mov(X)
for which: α.(KX + D) < 015. Then:

1. d > 0 (since dα > 0,∀α).
2. F ′ = F .
3. µα′,min(F ) > 0.
15Let us repeat that we let (X, D) run through all orbifold birational modiﬁca-

tions of our initial orbifold pair, in the deﬁnition of dα.

We shall now ﬁx such a class α′ ∈ Mov0(X/Z), and denote it α.
By assumption, for all ﬁbrations g : Z 99K Y with dim(Y ) > 0, we
have: KY +DY is not pseudo-eﬀective (replacing the initial g by a ‘neat’
birational model which induces an orbifold morphism g : (Z, DZ) →
Indeed, by the property 2.5
(Y, DY ) to its orbifold base (Y, DY )).
recalled from [6], the orbifold base of g ◦ f : (X, D) → Y is also the
orbifold base of g : (Z, DZ) → Y , because f : (X, D) → (Z, DZ) is an
orbifold morphism.
We have two cases: either dim(Z) = 0, and the property 3 of The-
orem 1.2 is established, or n > dim(Z) > 0, and we can apply induc-
tion: the property 3 is then satisﬁed by (Z, DZ). There thus exists
β,min(p∗((T (Z, DZ)) > 0, if p : W → Z is any
β ∈ Mov0(Z) such that µH
Kawamata cover adapted to (Z, DZ).
We shall now show that we are in position to apply the results of
§.4.4 to the classes α and β thus constructed. We thus consider again
the diagram introduced in §.4.4 and §.4.3, with the same meaning:

In order to apply Theorem 4.7, we thus choose the movable class
βX = β” on X constructed in Proposition 3.6.(6). We thus have:
f∗(β”) = β and β”.Fj = 0 for all components Fj of the divisor F
‘partially supported on the ﬁbres of f ’ which contains the support of
the Cokernel GH of the map ∆ considered in the statement of Theorem
4.7, which thus applies and concludes the proof of Theorem 1.2.
We have thus proved the claimed conclusion 3 of Theorem 1.2 on
some orbifold birational model g : (X ′, D′) → (X, D) of (X, D). The
following lemma 6.3 shows that the conclusion still holds for (X, D) it-
self, when we apply this lemma to the natural inclusion dg : T (X ′, D′) →
T (X, D) lifted to a ﬁbre-product of Kawamata covers adapted to them,
as in Proposition 5.9.
Lemma 6.3. Let g : X ′ → X be a birational morphism between two
projective connected complex manifolds, let E ′ → g∗(E) be an injection
of torsionfree coherent sheaves on X ′, which is generically isomorphic.
Let α′ ∈ Mov(X ′), and α := g∗(α′) ∈ Mov(X).
Then: µα′,min(E ′) ≤ µα,min(E).
In particular: µα,min(E) > 0 if µα′,min(E ′) > 0.

Proof. Let Q be any non-zero quotient of E: it induces (by considering
the intersection of the kernel corresponding to g∗(Q) with E ′, and the
related quotient) a quotient Q′ of E ′ together with an injection Q′ →
g∗(Q) which is generically isomorphic. We thus have: det(g∗(Q)) =

det(Q′) + E′, where E′ is an eﬀective divisor supported on the excep-
tional divisor of g. We have: µg∗(α)(g∗(Q)) = µα(Q)) ≥ µα,min(E).
Moreover: 0 < µα′,min(E ′) ≤ α′.det(Q′) ≤ α′.det(g∗(Q)) = α.det(Q),
by the projection formula, which implies the claim.

(cid:3)

The fact that α can be choosen to be ‘movable-big’ is a consequence

of the following general:

Lemma 6.4. Let E be a coherent torsionfree sheaf on the connected
complex projective manifold X. Let α, β ∈ Mov(X), with β big, be
such that µα,min(E) > 0. Let αt := α + tβ. Then µαt,min(E) > 0 for
some ε > 0 and any 0 ≤ t ≤ ε.
Proof. The property is established in [9], Lemma 5.6 for α rational, and
in [17], Theorem 3.4 in general when E is α-stable. One deduces the
general case by replacing E by the successive α-semi-stable quotients of
its α-Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltration, and using Jordan-Hölder ﬁltrations
by stable sheaves of the same α-slope of these quotients. We thus get
a ﬁltration of E by α-stable sheaves of positive slope. This property is
then preserved for αt, if 0 ≤ t is suﬃciently small.

7. Orbifold Rational quotient

We shall show here the existence of a ‘rational quotient’ ([4], see also

[19] under the name ‘MRC-ﬁbration’) in the orbifold context.

Theorem 7.1. Let (X, D) be smooth, complex projective and con-
nected. There exists (on some suitable birational model) an orbifold
morphism which is a ﬁbration ρ : (X, D) → (R, DR) onto its (smooth)
orbifold base (R, DR) which has the following two properties:
1. Its smooth orbifold ﬁbres (Xr, Dr) are sRC (Xr := g−1(r), r ∈ R).
2. KR + DR is pseudo-eﬀective.
This ﬁbration is unique, up to orbifold birational equivalence.

Of course, R = X (resp. R is a point) if and only if KX + D is

pseudo-eﬀective (resp. (X, D) is sRC).

The proof consists in combining Theorem 1.2 with the following fac-

torisation criterion, and its Corollary 7.3:

Proposition 7.2. Let (X, D) be as above, together with two orbifold
morphisms which are ﬁbrations over their orbifold bases: f : (X, D) →
(R, DR) and g : (X, D) → (Z, DZ). Assume that:

1. KR + DR is pseudo-eﬀective.
2. The generic orbifold ﬁbre (Xr, Dr) of g is sRC.
Then: there exists a rational map h : Z → Y such that h ◦ g = f .

30

FRÉDÉRIC CAMPANA AND MIHAI PĂUN

Proof. We shall prove this in two steps: ﬁrst when the map f : X → R
is generically ﬁnite, and then reduce to this special case.
We thus assume ﬁrst that f is generically ﬁnite. Denote by Rz :=
f (Xz) ⊂ R the image of a general ﬁbre Xz of g by f . The commutative
diagram:

(Xz, Dz)

/ (KXz + Dz)⊗m

All these maps are generically injective. By assumption, we have,
for a certain movable class α on X: µα,max(Ω1(Xz, Dz)) < 0. Since
KX + D is pseudo-eﬀective, so is KXz + Dz, which contradicts the
z ((Ω1(Xz, Dz))⊗m), if πz : Yz → Xz is
injection π∗
a Kawamata cover adapted to (Xz, Dz).
We now prove that the general case can be reduced to the special

z ((KXz + Dz)⊗m) ⊂ π∗

case just treated by appropriate slicing.

Let us ﬁrst consider the natural map: f × g : X → R × Z, and let
W be the normalisation of its image W ′ ⊂ R × Z. We thus obtain two
projections, surjective with connected ﬁbres: fW : W → R and gW :
W → Z. The ﬁbres Wz := g−1
W (z), z ∈ Z are thus of the form: Wz =
Rz × {z}, where Rz is deﬁned above. We thus get a natural (rational)
map γ : Z → Chow(R) sending the generic z ∈ Z to the point γ(z) :=
[Rz] ∈ Chow(R) representing the reduced irreducible variety supported
by Rz. In this way, W is nothing, but the (normalised closure) of the
incidence graph of the universal family of cycles of R parametrised by
Z ∗ ⊂ Z, the Zariski-open subset over which γ is regular.
By appropriate blow-ups of X and Z, we can assume that γ is regular
(the details are a little bit lengthy, but quite standard. In the process
all properties are preserved. In particular, (R, DR) is unchanged).

Let T := γ(Z) be the image of Z, and VT ⊂ R × T the incidence
graph of the universal family of cycles of R parametrised by T . We thus
easily see that W = (idR×γ)−1(VT ). Let d := dim(X)−dim(R) be the
dimension of the generic ﬁbre of f . Let also Z ′ ⊂ T be the complete
intersection of d general hypersurfaces of T , X ′ := (idR×(γ◦g))−1(Z ′),
f ′ : X ′ → R the restriction of f , and γ ◦ g) := g′ : X ′ → Z ′. It is an

easy veriﬁcation that f ′ is generically ﬁnite onto (since clearly onto,
and with dim(X) − dim(X ′) = d), that (R, DR) is still the orbifold
base of f ′ : (X ′, D′ := D ∩ X ′) → R (since for each irreducible divisor
E ⊂ R, one has: g′∗(E) = g∗(E) ∩ X ′, and the genericity of the choice
of Z ′ ⊂ T ), and that the (orbifold) general ﬁbre of g′ is the same, by
construction, as the ones of g over γ−1(Z ′).

(cid:3)

Corollary 7.3. Let (X, D) be smooth projective, together with an orb-
ifold morphism g : (X, D) → (Z, DZ) which is a ﬁbration with (Z, DZ)
its orbifold base. Assume that both (Z, DZ) and the general orbifold
ﬁbre (Xz, Dz) of g are sRC. Then so is (X, D).
Proof. Let ρ : (X, D) → (R, DR) be (on some suitable birational
model) an orbifold morphism which is a ﬁbration onto its orbifold base,
with KR +DR pseudo-eﬀective. We want to show that dim(R) = 0. By
Proposition 7.2, we get a factorisation h : Z → R such that ρ = h ◦ g.
But now, g being an orbifold morphism, (R, DR) is also the orbifold
base of h : (Z, DZ) → R. Because we assumed (Z, DZ) to be sRC, we
get: dim(R) = 0 as claimed.

(cid:3)

Proof. (of Theorem 7.1) We proceed by induction on n := dim(X).
When n = 1, everything is clear, since (X, D) is either sRC or has
pseudo-eﬀective canonical bundle KX +D. We thus assume that n ≥ 2,
and that the conclusion of Theorem 7.1 holds whenever n′ < n.
Existence of ρ: If KX + D is pseudo-eﬀective, ρ := idX . Otherwise,
there exists (on a suitable birational model of our initial (X, D)) a
ﬁbration g : (X, D) → (Z, DZ) as in the proposition 7.2 with sRC
orbifold ﬁbres, and dim(Z) < n. The conclusion of the theorem 7.1
thus applies to (Z, DZ). By taking further birational models, we have
a ‘rational quotient’ ρ′ : (Z, DZ) → (R, DR). The Corollary 7.3 now
shows that the orbifold ﬁbres of ρ := ρ′ ◦ f : (X, D) → (R, DR) are
sRC. Because f : (X, D) → (Z, DZ) was an orbifold morphism, the
orbifold base of ρ : (X, D) → R is (R, DR). And ρ thus possesses the
two characteristic properties of a ‘rational quotient’.
: (X, D) →
(R′, DR′) be two ﬁbrations having the two characteristic properties
stated in Theorem 7.1. By Proposition 7.2, we have factorisations
h : R → R′ (resp. h′ : R′ → R) such that ρ′ = h ◦ ρ (resp. such that
ρ = ρ′ ◦ h′). Thus R = R′, ρ = ρ′.
Uniqueness of (R, DR) up to birational equivalence: This is a general
property of ‘neat’ birational models of ﬁbrations. See Section 2.5 (cid:3)

Uniqueness of ρ: Let ρ : (X, D) → (R, DR) and ρ′

8. Fano orbifolds.

We prove here Theorem 1.3 as an easy application of Theorem 2.11

in [10].

Let g : (X ′, D′) → (X, D) be a birational morphism, with (X ′, D′)
smooth such that D′ is the strict transform of D in X ′, together with

32

FRÉDÉRIC CAMPANA AND MIHAI PĂUN

a ﬁbration f : X ′ → Z on a smooth projective variety Z. We assume
f : (X ′, D′) → Z to be ‘neat’ and its orbifold base (Z, DZ) to be
smooth. Because we assumed (X, D) to be klt, we can write: g∗(KX +
D) = KX ′ + D′ + ∆′, where ∆′ is supported on the exceptional locus of
g, and where (X ′, (D′ + ∆′)) is again klt. Let H be ample on Z. Since
A := −(KX + D) is ample, we can write g∗(A) = ϑ.E′ + A′ + ε.f ∗(H),
where ϑ > 0, ε > 0 are chosen to be suﬃciently small, and E′ is the
reduced support of the exceptional divisor of g.We can thus write:
0 = g∗(KX +D+A) = KX ′ +D′+(∆′+ϑ.E′)+A′+ε.f ∗(H). Since A′, H
are ample and (∆′ + ϑ.E′) is supported on E′ and (X ′, (∆′ + ϑ.E′) is klt
for 0 < ϑ suﬃciently small, we can chose Q-divisors linearly equivalent
to A′ and H in such a way that:

1. D” := D′ + E′ + A′ + ε.f ∗(H) has snc support and is such that:

(X ′, D”) is lc.

2. A′ is f -horizontal (for example: its support is irreducible)
3. DZ + H + f (D′vert) has snc support, where (•)hor and (•)vert stand
for the f -horizontal and f -vertical parts of a divisor (•) on X ′.
We then have: KX ′ + D” = E”, where E” is supported on E′ and
(X ′, E”) is klt. Moreover: g : (X ′, D”) → (X, D) is an orbifold mor-
phism (because we have equipped all the components of E′ with mul-
tiplicities +∞, which was the reason to replace (∆′ + ϑ.E′) by E′)
.
Let now (Z, DZ) be the orbifold base of f : (X ′, D”) → Z, which is
Z = DZ + ε.H, by

also ‘neat’. We have, for its orbifold base (Z, D′
our generic choice of the Q-divisor H on Z.

Z): D′

Now, by [10], Theorem 2.11: KX ′/Z + (D”)vert − D(f, 0) is pseudo-
eﬀective. Here D(f, 0) is an eﬀective f -vertical divisor for the deﬁnition
In particular, KX ′/Z + D” − f ∗(DZ +
of which we refer to loc.cit.
ε.H) = E” − f ∗(KZ + DZ + ε.H) is pseudo-eﬀective. Let C ⊂ X be
the complete intersection of ample divisors avoiding g(E′), and C ′ its
inverse image in X ′; then g∗(C ′).(KZ + DZ) ≤ −g∗(C ′).(ε.H < 0, since
E′.C ′ = 0. This implies that −(KZ + DZ) is not pseudo-eﬀective, since
[g∗(C ′)] ∈ Mov(Z). (cid:3)

When (X, D) is smooth and Fano, but not klt, one still gets:

Corollary 8.1. Let (X, D) be a smooth orbifold which is Fano, and
let (Z, DZ) be the orbifold base of any neat orbifold birational model of
any rational dominant ﬁbration f : X 99K Z. Then:

1.

If (KZ + DZ) is pseudo-eﬀective, ν(Z, KZ + DZ) = 0, where

ν(Z, L) is the ‘numerical dimension’ of the Q-divisor L.

2. X is rationally connected.

Proof. For Claim 1, argue as before, writing 0 = g∗(KX + D + A) =
KX ′ + D′ + (∆′) + A′, where this time A′ is a Q-divisor linear equivalent
to g∗(A) choosen suﬃciently generic, so that the support of D” :=
D′ + E′ + A′ is snc. We then get, for the orbifold base (Z, DZ) of

33

f : (X ′, D”) → Z, from [10], 2.11 again: KX ′/Z + D” − f ∗(DZ) := P
is pseudo-eﬀective. On the other hand, this Q-divisor P is linearly
equivalent to: E”−f ∗(KZ +DZ), with E” := E′−∆′, which is eﬀective
and g-exceptional. If KZ +DZ is pseudo-eﬀective, we thus get: f ∗(KZ +
DZ) = E” − P , and thus:

ν(Z, KZ + DZ) ≤ ν(X ′, f ∗(KZ + DZ)) ≤ ν(X ′, E”) = 0.

Since KZ + DZ is pseudo-eﬀective, we have: ν(Z, KZ + DZ) ≥ 0, and
Claim 1.
For Claim 2, it suﬃces to note that KZ is not pseudoeﬀective if so
(cid:3)

is KZ + DZ.

Remark 8.2. Claim 2 was already observed in [24]. Using Theorem
2.11 of [10] instead of Log-subajunction techniques simpliﬁes consider-
ably the proof. Kawamata’s base-point freeness, permits to easily extend
the above results to the case when −(KX + D) is nef and big.

9. Rational curves

Let (X, D) be slope-rationally connected in the sense that there ex-
π∗(α),min(π∗(T (X, D)) > 0 for some

ists a movable classe α such that µG
(or any) adapted Kawamata-cover π : Y → (X, D).
The aim of this section is to improve Theorem 1.2 to show that
the class α can be choosen to be ‘Geometrically Rational big’ in the
sense below, if (X, D) is klt and if the following question has a positive
answer:

Question 1: Let (X, D) be a connected and smooth complex-projective

orbidold pair such that KX +D is not pseudo-eﬀective. Does there exist
on X an algebraic family of rational curves (Ct)t∈T , parametrised by an
irreducible projective variety T , whose generic member is irreducible,
and such that −(KX + D).Ct > 0?
this question to the following special case:

When (X, D) is klt, the known results of the LMMP permit to reduce

Question 1.2: Let (X, D) be a connected and smooth klt complex-
projective orbidold pair such that, after a ﬁnite number of divisorial
contractions and Log-ﬂips ϕ : (X, D) → (X ′, D′), with D′ = ϕ∗(D),
(X ′, D′) is still klt, with X ′ Q-factorial, and KX ′ + D′ is Fano with
Picard number 1. Does there exist on X an algebraic family of ratio-
nal curves (Ct)t∈T , parametrised by an irreducible projective variety T ,
whose generic member is irreducible, and such that −(KX +D).Ct > 0?
The problem is to lift a suitable covering family of rational curves on
(X ′, D′) to X preserving the negativity of the intersection number with
K + D. Note that, in general, there is no covering family of rational
curves on X ′ avoiding the non-canonical singularities of (X ′, D′).
It
might, however, be true that the canonical singularities of this pair can
be avoided.

34

FRÉDÉRIC CAMPANA AND MIHAI PĂUN

More might possibly be said in order to characterise slope-Rational
connectedness by rational curves (see Question 2 at the end of this
section), in analogy with the case when D = 0.

The sections §.9.1 and §.9.2 below are used below only in order to

get the ‘bigness’ statement in Theorem 9.11.

9.1. Geometrically Rational classes.

Deﬁnition 9.1. Lat X be smooth, complex projective and connected,
and α ∈ Mov(X). We say that α is ‘Geometrically Rational’ if it be-
longs to the closed cone RMov(X) generated by classes of the form [C],
for an irreducible rational curve C on X. We say that α is ‘Geometri-
cally Rational big’ if it belongs to the interior [RMov(X) ∩ Mov0(X)]
of this cone.
Remark 9.2. In general, the interior RMov0(X) inside RMov(X) of
this cone is contained, but not equal to [RMov(X)∩Mov0(X)], because,
even if X is a rational surface, RMov(X) is a strict closed subcone (of
nonempty interior, see below) of Mov(X). An exemple is X, given
by P2 blown-up in 16 points. If C is the strict transform of a generic
quintic through these 16 points, then C is easily seen to be ample, but
KX.C = +1, which shows that [C] /∈ RMov(X), since −KX .α ≥ 0 for
any α ∈ Mov(X).
X if X is rationally con-
nected?

Is it true that Rmov(X) = Mov(X) ∩ K ≤0
We denote by K <0(X) (resp. K ≤0(X)) be the cone of classes in
N1(X) which have negative (resp. non-negative) intersection with KX .

Proposition 9.3. Let X be a connected complex projective manifold.
Then:

1. RMov(X) is non-empty if and only if X is uniruled.
2. Mov(X) ∩ K <0(X) is non-empty if and only if X is uniruled.
3. RMov(X) ∩ Mov0(X) is nonempty if and only if X is rationally
4. RMov(X) has nonempty interior in N1(X) if and only if X is

connected.

rationally connected.

Proof. Claim 1 is essentially the deﬁnition of uniruledness. Claim 2 is
[21].

Claim 3. Assume ﬁrst that α ∈ RMov(X) ∩ Mov0(X). There
then exists some irreducible rational curve C on X such that [C] ∈
RMov0(X), which belongs to an algebraic family of X-covering ratio-
nal curves Ct, t ∈ T . Assume X were not rationally connected. Let
then r : X 99K R be its ‘rational quotient’ (which is an almost holo-
morphic ﬁbration). We then have: r∗([C]) = 0. If H ⊂ R is an eﬀective
non-zero diviseur, then HX := f −1(H) does not meet the generic Ct,
and HX.[C] = 0, contradicting the fact that [C] ∈ Mov0(X). Thus: X
is rationally connected if RMov0(X) 6= ∅.

In the other direction, assume that X is rationally connected. Let
H be an ample divisor on X. There thus exists an integer d > 0 such
that any two points of X can be joined by an irreducible rational curve
C of degree at most d (by the ‘comb deformation technique’ of [19], see
[13], Theorem 4.27, p. 105). Let then [Cs], s = 1, ..., N be the classes of
irreducible rational curves of degree at most d belonging to irreducible
algebraic families of rational curves connecting two generic two points
of X, and let α := Ps=N
s=1 [Cs]. Then α.D > 0, for any irreducible
eﬀective non-zero divisor D ⊂ X, since [Cs].D ≥ 0,∀s, and [Cs].D > 0
for at least one s (a priori depending on D), by choosing one of the two
points outside of D, and Cs irreducible16.Thus α ∈ RMov0(X), by the
following Corollary 9.10 below.
Claim 4. Assume that X is not rationally connected. Claim 3 above
then shows that Rmov(X) ∩ Mov0(X) = ∅. A fortiori, Rmov(X) ⊂
Mov(X) has no interior point in Mov0(X).
Conversely, assume that X is rationally connected, and let α ∈
Rmov(X) ∩ Mov0(X) be as above.
It follows again from the ‘comb
deformation technique’ of [19] (see [13] for example), that α + ε[Γ] ∈
RMov(X) for any irreducible rational curve Γ ⊂ X if ε > 0 is suf-
ﬁciently small. But the KX -negative part K <0(X) of the closed cone
NE(X) of eﬀective curves on X is generated by classes of Mori-extremal
rational curves on X, by the ‘cone theorem’ (see [D] for example).
Since K <0(X) has nonempty interior in NE(X), any class of the form
α − ε[Γ] as above belongs to the interior of RMov(X) in NE(X) if Γ
is a Mori-extremal rational curve on X.

9.2. A bigness criterion for movable classes. Let X be smooth,
connected and complex projective. Let (Cv)v∈V be an algebraic family
of curves parametrised by a complex projective irreducible space V . We
assume that Cv is irreducible, for v ∈ V generic, and that the family
is X-covering. The class [C := Cv] ∈ Mov(X) is thus independent of
v. The closed cone of H2(X, R) generated by such classes is Mov(X).
Recall that a class α ∈ Mov(X) is ‘big’ if it lies in Mov0(X), the
interior of the cone Mov(X). This notion is obviously not preserved
by blow-ups. We have the obvious:
Lemma 9.4. α ∈ Mov(X) is big if and only if, equivalently:

1. α.P > 0 for any pseudo-eﬀective divisor.
2. α− ε.An−1 ∈ Mov(X) for some ε > 0, if A is some ample divisor

on X.

Let (Cv)v∈V be as above, and let q : P(T X) → X be the projectiﬁed
(by lines) tangent bundle of X. Then each generic Cv has a natural
tangential lifting cCv ⊂ P(T X). We denote by [bC] ∈ N1(P(T X)) the
corresponding class. then [bC] ∈ Mov(P(T X)) if, through the generic

point x ∈ X and the tangent direction τ ∈ T Xx, there exists some Cv
going through x with tangent direction τ .
Theorem 9.5. Assume that [bC] ∈ Mov(P(T X)). Assume that there
exists a non-zero pseudo-eﬀective divisor P ∈ N 1(X) such that [C].P =
0. Then P is Q-eﬀective.
Proof. Let p : Y → X be a surjective map with connected ﬁbers be-
tween two smooth compact manifolds Y and X of dimension n + 1 and
n, respectively. Given a generic point y ∈ Y , we denote by Cy the ﬁber
p−1(cid:0)p(y)(cid:1) of p passing through y; if more than one map p is involved,
indices are used in order to distinguish the corresponding ﬁbers.

Proposition 9.6. Let Y be a n + 1-dimensional (smooth) compact
complex manifold, and let T be a closed positive (1, 1) current on Y .
Let surjective maps pj : Y → Xj be given, where Xj is an n-dimensional
compact manifold for j = 1, . . . n + 1 having the following properties.
(i) There exists a proper analytic set S ⊂ Y such that for each
y ∈ Y \ S the vector space generated by the tangent space of the
curves Cj,y at y for j = 1, . . . n + 1 is TY,y.
(ii) The restriction of the current T to each generic ﬁber of pj is

equal to zero, for each j = 1, . . . n + 1.

Then we have χY \ST = 0.
Proof. Let S ⊂ Y be an analytic subset of Y , such that the restriction
of each pj to the complement Y0 := Y \ S is a smooth, proper ﬁbration.
We show next that we have χY \ST = 0.
Let y ∈ Y0 be an arbitrary point, and let z1, . . . zn+1 be a set of

coordinates at y such that for each j = 1, . . . n + 1 the subspace

(13)

C

∂
∂zj

coincides with the tangent space of Cj,y at y. The choice of such a
coordinate system is possible, due to the hypothesis (i) above.

Locally near y the current T can be written as

T|Ω =Xj,k

Tjkdzj ∧ dzk

(14)

(15)

where Tjk are distributions of order zero on Ω. Let p : Y → X be one
of the maps above; we recall the following formula of Fubini type (cf.
[22])

ZΩ

T ∧ p∗η =Zx∈X

ηZΩ∩p−1(x)

T,

where the restriction T|p−1(x) is well deﬁned for almost all x ∈ X, so
In (15) we
that the right hand side member in (15) is meaningful.

denote by η a smooth form of type (n, n) deﬁned (at least) in a open
set including p(Ω).

By the implicit function theorem, there exist (ηj)j=1,...n+1 a set of
smooth (n, n) forms deﬁned in a small open set centered at pj(y) in Xj
such that we have

37

(16)

p∗
j (ηj) = ξ1 ∧ . . . ξj−1 ∧ ξj+1 ∧ . . . ξn+1

where we use the notation ξj := √−1dzj ∧ dzj.

The Fubini formula (15) combined with the hypothesis (ii) show that

(17)

χΩT ∧ ξ1 ∧ . . . ξj−1 ∧ ξj+1 ∧ . . . ξn+1 = 0

for each j = 1, . . . , n + 1. In other words, the diagonal distributions
Tjj are identically zero, and so it is the restriction of T to Ω (this is a
consequence of the fact that T is positive).

The current T has thus no mass on Y \ S.
Remark 9.7. 1. The hypothesis (ii) above means that 0 = ρ· Cj,y,∀j,
if ρ := {T} is the cohomology class of T in H 1,1(X, R), since the coho-
mology class of T|Cj,y is the restriction of ρ to Cj,y.
2. Proposition 9.6 implies that ρ is eﬀective, ie: it contains an eﬀec-
tive R-divisor, since T = χY \ST + χST , and so: T = χST . The claim
follows from the ‘support theorem’ (see [14]).

Corollary 9.8. The class [Cv] is big if [cCv] ∈ Mov(P(T X)), and either:
1. cCv ∈ P(T X) is ‘strictly movable’ in the sense that any point
z ∈ P(T X) is contained in some irreducible cCv, or:
2. [Cv].D > 0, for any irreducible divisor D ⊂ X.
From this we get immediately:

Corollary 9.9. Let [Cs] ∈ Mov(X), s = 1, ..., N, be such that [cCs] ∈
s=1 ts.[Cs], 0 ≤ ts ∈ R,∀s be such
Mov(P(T X)),∀s.
that α.D > 0 for any eﬀective non-zero divisor D ⊂ X. Then α ∈
Mov0(X).

If α := Ps=N

In the case of rational curves, we get:

Corollary 9.10. Let [Cs] ∈ RMov(X), s = 1, ..., N, be such that
[cCs] ∈ Mov(P(T X)),∀s. Let α := Ps=N
s=1 ts.[Cs], for non-negative real
numbers ts. If α.D > 0 for any eﬀective non-zero divisor D ⊂ X, then
α ∈ RMov0(X) ⊂ (Mov0(X) ∩ RMov(X)).
Proof. We already know that α ∈ (Mov0(X) ∩ RMov(X)). Since
RMov(X) is a subcone of

9.3. Slope positivity relative to Rational classes.

We can now improve Theorem 1.2 as follows, in the klt case, but

assuming a positive answer to Question 1 above:

Theorem 9.11. Let (X, D) be a smooth connected klt complex projec-
tive orbifold pair which is slope Rationally connected. Assume that the
question 1.2 at the beginning of the present section is positive.

There then exists a ‘Geometrically Rational big’ class α such that

µα,min(π∗(T (X, D))) > 0.

Proof. The proof again works by induction on n := dim(X). When
n = 1, the statement is clear, since every big class class is then Geo-
metrically Rational. We now assume that the assertion holds true for
every n′ < n. We consider two cases (possibly replacing (X, D) by
some of its orbifold birational models:

1. There exists α ∈ Mov0(X) and {0} ( F ( π∗(T (X, D)), satu-
rated, such that µα(F ) > 0.
2. For every α ∈ Mov0(X) and any saturated {0} ( F ( π∗(T (X, D)),
we have: µα(F ) ≤ 0.
Case 1: We then get (after replacing (X, D) by a suitable orbifold
birational model), and choosing rank(F ) minimum, a neat ﬁbration
which is an orbifold morphism to its orbifold base f : (X, D) →
(Z, DZ). And (Z, DZ) is still sRC, as well as the smooth orbifold
ﬁbres (Xz, Dz) of f . We have: 0 < d := dim(Z) < n, and thus
get, as in the proof of Theorem 1.2, classes α ∈ Mov0(X/Z) and
β ∈ Mov0(Z) such that µβ,min(p∗(T (Z, DZ))) > 0, f∗(α) = 0, and
µα,min(π∗(T (Xz, Dz))) > 0. We may, by induction on the dimension,
assume that β ∈ RMov0(Z), and αz ∈ RMov(Xz), where αz is the
restriction to the ‘general’ smooth ﬁbre Xz of f .
The conclusion in this case 1 then follows from (the proof of Theorem

1.2 and) the following:
Lemma 9.12. Let f : X → Z be a ﬁbration between connected complex
projective manifolds, together with α ∈ Mov(X/Z) and β ∈ RMov0(Z)
such that f∗(α) = 0 and αz ∈ RMov0(Xz). Then:

1. There exists β′ ∈ RMov(X) such that f∗(β′) = β, and:
2. γ := ε.ρ + k.α + β′ ∈ RMov0(X) for any k > 0 suﬃciently large
and ε > 0 suﬃciently small, if ρ ∈ RMov0(X), which is nonempty by
Proposition 9.3, since X is rationally connected.

Proof. Claim 1: We may reduce to the case where β = [Ct] is the class of
a Z-covering algebraic family of irreducible rational curves [Ct], t ∈ T .
Because the ﬁbres f are rationally connected, it follows from [15] that
for t generic, there exists a section C ′
t of ft : Xt := f −1(Ct) → Ct.
Let αt be the restriction of α to Xt, which makes sense, since f∗(α) =
t] is in RMov(Xt), for
0. From [19], we deduce that β′

t := kt.αt + [C ′

39

kt > 0 suﬃciently large, and is thus the class of an Xt-covering family
of rational curves of Xt, with (ft)∗(β′
t) = [Ct]. From the countability
at onﬁnity of the Chow-Barlet space of curves of X, we deduce the
existence of a k > 0 such that β′ := k.α + β ∈ RMov(X) is such that
f∗(β′) = β, which is Claim 1.
Claim 2: Since ρ ∈ RMov0(X) and β′ ∈ RMov(X), ε.ρ + β′ ∈
RMov0(X) for any ε > 0 suﬃciently small. On the other hand, we get
from the proof of Theorem 1.2 that µπ∗(k.α+β ′),min(π∗(T (X, D))) > 0
for k > 0 suﬃciently large. It now follows that this remains true for
ε.ρ + k.α + β′, by Lemma 6.4.
(cid:3)

Case 2: We seem to need to use [1], here. Let ψ : X 99K X0 be
a sequence of divisorial contractions and log-ﬂips, with (X0, D0) =
(X0, ψ∗(D)), such that one has a Log-Fano-contraction ϕ : (X0, D0) →
Z with (n − d) := dim(Z) < n, and of relative Picard number 1.
By taking a suitable orbifold birational model of (X, D), we shall as-
sume that ψ is regular. Choose α0 := (−(KX0 + D0))d−1.H n−d, where
H = ϕ∗(HZ), with H ample on Z. This is a movable curve class
on X with ϕ∗(α0) = 0. Let ψ∗(α0) := α ∈ Mov(X) be its inverse
image. We thus have: f∗(α) = 0, if f = ϕ ◦ ψ : X → Z. Let
F := π∗(Kerd(df )) ∩ π∗(T (X, D)), if π : Y → (X, D) is a Kawamata-
cover adapted to (X, D). Then µα(F ) > 0, since f∗(α) = 0, and
−α.(KXz +Dz) > 0, if Xz is a generic ﬁbre of f . We are thus in the ﬁrst
case, unless F = π∗(T (X, D)). Since we are in case 2, dim(Z) = 0, that
is: (X0, D0) is Fano of Picard rank 1, π∗(T (X, D)) is semi-stable with
respect to π∗(α), and µπ∗(α),min(π∗(T (X, D))) > 0. Question 1.2 having
a positive answer, Moreover, (X0, D0) being Log-Fano of Picard rank 1,
X0 is covered by an algebraic family of rational curves C ′
t of class (pro-
portional to) α0 such that −C ′
t.(KX0 + D0) > 0. Question 1.2 having
by assumption a positive answer, there exists a class in α′ ∈ RMov(X)
with −(KX + D).α′ > 0. The properties shown above for α still hold
for α′ also, and in particular: π∗(T (X, D)) is semi-stable with respect
to π∗(α′), with: µπ∗(α′),min(π∗(T (X, D))) > 0. Since X is rationally
connected, there exists ρ ∈ RMov0(X), and ε.ρ + α′ ∈ RMov0(X),
enjoying these same properties, by the same argument as in case 1,
which also concludes the proof in this case.
(cid:3)

Question 2:
1. Can the big rational class α constructed above be choosen of the
form [C], for an irreducible rational curve C ⊂ X with arbitrary ample
normal bundle, and going through any given ﬁnite set of points?
2. If yes, can C be so chosen that π∗(T (X, D))|C ′ is ample, if C ′ =

π−1(C)?
Remark 9.13. The question 2 might possibly depend on a version of
the Grauert-Müllich restriction theorem for the curves of the form C ′
above and for the vector bundle π∗(T (X, D)) on them.

10. Motivation: the decomposition of the Core map.
In [6], Théorème 10.3, we showed the decomposition c = (J ◦ r)n
of the ‘core’ map c : (X, D) → (C, DC) of a smooth projective orb-
ifold pair (X, D). This decomposition was conditional in the ‘C orb
n,m’-
conjecture introduced in [5], §. 4.1, p. 564. The C orb
n,m conjecture was
used in order to deﬁne the map r : (X, D) → (R∗, DR∗), its ‘κ-rational
quotient’, for any smooth orbifold (X, D), while J : (X, D) 99K (J, DJ )
was a neat model of its ‘Moishezon-Iitaka ﬁbration’ when κ(X, D) ≥ 0.
The ‘Slope-Rational Quotient’ ρ : (X, D) → (R, DR) deﬁned above
permits to give (unconditionally) a variant of the ‘κ-rational quotient’.
Conjecturally, these two maps actually coincide. We give some details
below.
Deﬁnition 10.1. ([6], Déﬁnition 5.23, Remarque 5.24)17Let (X, D) be
a smooth (complex projective18, connected) orbifold pair. Deﬁne:
κ+(X, D) := max{κ(X ′, L′)|m > 0, L′ ⊂ ⊗m(π∗(Ω1(X, D)), rk(L′) = 1},
and: κ+(X, D) := max{κ(Z, DZ)|f : (X ′, D′) → (Z, DZ)}, where
(X ′, D′) is birationally orbifold equivalent to (X, D), and f is a ‘neat’
orbifold model of (f, D).

To simplify notation, we write: f : (X, D) 99K (Z, DZ) for a neat

orbifold model of such a ﬁbration.

We obviously have: κ(X, D) ≤ κ+(X, D) ≤ κ+(X, D).
In [6], Corollaire 6.14, we showed, assuming C orb

n,m, the existence of a
unique ﬁbration r : (X, D) 99K (Z, DZ) such that its general orbifold ﬁ-
bres (Xr, Dr) have κ+(Xr, Dr) = −∞, while its orbifold base (R∗, DR∗)
had κ(R∗, DR∗) ≥ 0.
We now replace κ by the numerical dimension ν, which usually turns
conjectures in theorems.

We showed in [11], that equality holds when we replace κ(X ′, L′)
by the numerical dimension ν(X ′, L′) if KX + D is pseudoeﬀective:
ν(X, D) := ν(X, KX + D) = ν+(X, D), the latter being deﬁned as the
maximum of ν(X ′, L′) for the same L′ as above.

Since: ν+(X, D) := −∞ if and only if: (X, D) is slope-rationally
connected, or equivalently, if: h0(X ′,⊗m(π∗(Ω1(X, D)) ⊗ A) = 0,∀k ≥
k(A), by our main result here, the ‘slope-rational quotient’ ρ : (X, D) 99K
(R,DR) deﬁned above unconditionally should coincide with r. The
problem one now faces is that KR + DR is pseudoeﬀective, instead of
having κ(R∗, DR∗) ≥ 0, as one had with the orbifold base of r. One can-
not however deﬁne any ‘Moishezon-Iitaka-ﬁbration’ for (R, DR) with-
out assuming that κ(R, DR) ≥ 0, if KR + DR is only known to be
pseudoeﬀective.

17The deﬁnition (and notation) given there is slightly diﬀerent, but should lead

to the same invariants.
