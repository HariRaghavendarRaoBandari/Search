Abstract

We deﬁne a new set of observables to probe the structure of the underlying event in hadron
collisions. We use the conventional deﬁnition of the “transverse region” in jet events and,
for a ﬁxed window in jet p⊥, propose to measure several discriminating quantities as a func-
tion of the level of activity in the transverse region. The measurement of these observables
in LHC data would reveal whether, e.g., the properties of “low-UE” events are compatible
with equivalent measurements in e+e− collisions (jet universality), and whether the scaling
behaviour towards “high-UE” events exhibits properties of non-trivial soft-QCD dynamics,
such as colour re-connections or other collective phenomena. We illustrate at
s = 13 TeV
that signiﬁcant discriminatory power is obtained in comparisons between MC models with
varying treatments of collective effects, including PYTHIA 8, EPOS, and DIPSY.

Introduction

The “jet pedestal effect”, now called the underlying event (UE), was ﬁrst observed by the UA1
experiment at CERN’s Sp¯pS collider, in an early study of jet events [1]. This study concluded
that, outside the core of a jet, “a constant ET plateau is observed, whose height is independent of
the jet ET” [1]. The plateau was substantially higher than that observed in minimum-bias events1
at the same energy [3–6]. Its characteristics have since been studied extensively, in pp and p¯p
collisions over two orders of magnitude in Centre of Mass (CM) energy, from RHIC [7,8] through
Tevatron [9–12] to LHC energies [13–25], the latter most recently extending to measurements at
13 TeV [26].

Theoretically, the UE is often roughly deﬁned as the collection of particles produced in a
single hadronic interaction which do not originate from the primary (“hard”) parton-parton scat-
tering, nor relate directly to it in the form of hadronised parton showers. However, since the

hard-interaction initiators are coloured (quarks or gluons), conﬁnement implies that it is in gen-
eral not possible to deﬁne uniquely which hadrons were produced by the hard interaction and
which belong to the UE.

Instead, physical observables that measure phase-space regions “outside the core of jets” are
used to provide operational deﬁnitions of the UE. Two main deﬁnitions are in current use: the
most common one is a purely geometrical deﬁnition of the UE as an angular region transverse
to a leading charged particle or jet [9], typically spanning 90◦ ± 30◦; an alternative deﬁnition of
the UE is what remains when hard jets have been removed, an early example of this being the
“Swiss Cheese” method introduced by CDF [10] now superseded by so-called “jet median/area”
techniques proposed in [27] and used e.g. by CMS [19, 28].

In addition to the average UE properties, several studies at the LHC have now also mea-
sured observables sensitive to the per-event ﬂuctuations. These include the ATLAS [14] study
of the widths of the charged-particle density and scalar-p⊥ sum distributions, and the CMS [22]
study of jet multiplicity in the UE. Such studies are crucial to pin down the underlying physics
mechanisms, revealing e.g. potentially interesting deviations from Poissonian ﬂuctuations, and
to what extent (soft) jets are required to build up the UE activity. In this paper, we propose to
go a step further, and study the UE properties as a function of its in-situ level; this will allow a
detailed exploration of the evolution of quantities such as strangeness fractions, particle spectra,
and (soft) jet rates, from low to high underlying activity. Though we focus mainly on identiﬁed-
particle rates, we emphasise that the method is general and can be applied to any UE property
as a function of any measure of UE activity. The explicit studies we propose are inspired by —
and are intended to be complementary to — minimum-bias studies as a function of multiplicity.
Of special interest is whether events with very low UE levels exhibit particle yields and spectra
more consistent with LEP fragmentation models than those of their higher-UE counterparts, and
whether high-UE events exhibit any clear signs of ﬂow or other collective effects. A comple-
mentary recent interesting proposal is that of [29] which suggests to measure similar observables
using forward multiplicity as the indicator of event activity.

On the theory side, the fragmentation process in the simple reference case of hadronic Z
decays is believed to be relatively well understood, and shower+hadronisation models such as
those implemented in the general-purpose Monte Carlo models HERWIG [30], PYTHIA [31], and
SHERPA [32], are capable of describing the majority of e+e− → hadrons data well (see e.g. the
plots available on mcplots [33]). However, moving to pp collisions, several additional compli-
cations arise, including initial-state radiation, beam remnants, diffraction, and multiple parton
interactions (MPI). The corresponding physics models are therefore necessarily also more com-
plicated. Starting from Rick Field’s observation with his “Tune A” [34] of the PYTHIA 6 MPI
model [35, 36] to Tevatron data [10] that a much higher degree of colour correlation than antici-
pated (between partons from different MPI systems) was required to ﬁt the p⊥ spectra of particles
in the UE at CDF, there have appeared progressively more indications that the physics of hadron
collisions is more complicated than was previously thought. The clues include the increase of
the average p⊥ with event multiplicity [35, 37–42], the large yields of hyperons [43–50], and the
overall relatively steep increase of average p⊥ with hadron mass [45, 46, 49–54] observed in pp
collisions. There are also more subtle indications, such as the unexpected ridge-like structure in
two-particle correlations at low ∆φ in high-multiplicity minimum-bias pp collisions observed by

2

CMS and ATLAS [55,56]. To shed further light on these effects, many studies of minimum-bias
events now focus on the scaling with charged-particle multiplicity (see e.g. [29, 41, 42, 57, 58]),
with a special emphasis on the highest accessible multiplicities. Here we extend this type of
study to the UE context.

At central rapidities, particle production in the UE is predominantly driven by the hadroni-
sation of soft/semi-hard secondary scatters within the colliding hadrons. The presence of the
requirement for high-p⊥ activity, such as that provided by a (hard) experimental trigger, biases
the UE towards larger activities than that of more inclusive (e.g. minimum-bias) event samples.
Within the context of MPI models (see e.g. [2, Chp. 7]), this can be understood as a consequence
of a bias towards smaller impact parameters, with the onset of the aforementioned UE plateau
signaling that the average impact parameter has become signiﬁcantly smaller than the radius of
the proton (cid:104)b(cid:105) (cid:28) rp, such that the two matter distributions are already completely overlapping
from that point onward (see e.g. [35, sect. VI.D]). There are, however, still large ﬂuctuations ex-
pected, some geometric in origin, others dynamic. Examples of geometric ﬂuctuations include,
for instance, the rare case of a large-impact parameter interaction producing a hard jet presum-
ably accompanied by very little UE, or the case of two protons happening to be compressed
transversely producing a larger-than-ordinary matter overlap and hence a very large UE. Even
for ﬁxed matter overlap, the number and hardness of MPI and shower branchings will exhibit
random (quantum) ﬂuctuations, and especially the tail towards high activities may be sensitive
to new QCD dynamics. Currently, we are not aware of any single phenomenological model that
spans all the possibilities. Nevertheless, on general grounds, we expect baryon and strangeness
fractions to be good tracers of the underlying mechanisms (in addition to hard MPI rates):

• The strange quark, having a mass very near ΛQCD, can act as a sensitive probe of any
changes to the energy density available at the time of hadronisation. Simply put, the more
strange quarks we see, relative to u and d quarks, the higher the effective string tension
or effective temperature we would extract, depending on the model. Note however that
the following two kinematic effects can also affect the interpretation of strangeness ratios:
ﬁrstly, the energy cost of producing a strange-quark rest mass, as compared to say an up
or down one, is relatively more signiﬁcant for a hadronising system with small invariant
mass than for one with large invariant mass; thus we expect small-mass systems to exhibit
lower strangeness ratios simply due to phase-space restrictions. Secondly, in the presence
of cuts on p⊥, the modelling of p⊥ spectra affects the ratio of the observed to total strange
production.

• Baryon production probes a unique colour topology and has clear experimental signatures.
Unlike mesons, baryons do not appear naturally in the “leading-colour” approximation
(NC → ∞), which is so heavily relied upon by MC event generators. This makes their
production somewhat more difﬁcult to model and interpret but also more interesting as a
probe of aspects beyond leading NC. The dependence on mass and strangeness can be
studied in detail, especially via dedicated Particle Identiﬁcation (PID) capabilities. For
example, a recent ALICE study managed to identify and study strongly decaying excited
states such as Σ(1385)± and Ξ(1530)0 [50].

3

Combined, strangeness, baryon number, and mass (or spin-multiplet) constitute a powerful 3-
dimensional ladder along which to chart the behaviour of the underlying event. All of the major
LHC experiments can provide sensitive measurements for key quantities such as multiplicities of
s , and Λ, while the more specialised PID capabilities of the ALICE and LHCb
charged tracks, K 0
experiments permit reconstruction of several of the more challenging (e.g. multi-strange and
excited) states that will be needed to complete the picture. The production of each particle species
can then be understood in the context of the overall modelling. For instance, a measurement
concluding that the production of kaons is low in a given model can have vastly different physics
implications, depending on whether the model underpredicts the rates of all other particles as
well.

In this study, the most powerful model discrimination arises from taking the ratios of aver-
aged identiﬁed-particle yields as described in sec. 3. This highlights the salient physics while
minimising the effects from global scaling differences between the considered models.

Though we focus on central rapidities in this paper, we round off by noting that, at for-
ward rapidities, the particle production is increasingly sensitive to the hadronisation of the beam
remnants, and to diffraction. In the context of MPI models, the amount of energy (both total and
transverse) scattered into the forward direction is also sensitive to the shape of Parton Distribution
Functions (PDFs) at low x (see e.g. [59]). Thus measurements at forward rapidities (e.g. AFP,
ALFA, LHCb, LHCf, TOTEM) are uniquely sensitive to these aspects and are required to un-
derstand the full dynamics. An obvious example of interest is the colour structure of the beam
remnant, which is tied in with that of the MPI by overall colour conservation2. Studying the
fragmentation process for diffractively tagged events would also furnish insights complementary
to those provided by the measurements we propose here.

2 Monte Carlo Models

For this study, we include the set of MC event generators and tunes listed in tab. 1. This permits
us to span a signiﬁcant range of possible dynamic effects, including colour ropes (with DIPSY),
hydrodynamics (with EPOS), and colour reconnections (“CR”, with PYTHIA 8). The varying
dynamical assumptions imply that these models will generate qualitatively different predictions

for the scaling with transverse activity in one or more of the observables we consider below. In
s = 13 TeV.
all cases, an inclusive ‘minimum bias’ event sample was generated for analysis at
The key features of these models, in the context of this paper, are described below. 10 million
events were simulated for each sample. The analysis was performed with RIVET [60], including
the use of FASTJET [61].

2Since the colliding hadrons are colour neutral, the colour charge of each hadron remnant must be equal and
opposite (in phase) to the sum of those of the MPI initiators (including the hardest-interaction initiators) taken from
that hadron.

2.1 Pythia and colour re-connections
The description of soft-inclusive physics in PYTHIA is rooted in perturbation theory, starting
from a resummed (unitarised) picture of multiple perturbative parton-parton interactions (MPI)
[35] supplemented by (interleaved) p⊥-ordered parton showers [62]. This builds up a partonic
substructure which can act as the starting point for the non-perturbative modelling of each event3.
However, when there is more than one MPI the perturbative era does not completely ﬁx the de-
tailed colour structure of the beam remnant, nor does it ﬁx the colour correlations between indi-
vidual MPI systems [63]. Additionally, within each system, ambiguities beyond leading colour
could affect the formation of strings, and strings could conceivably even interact dynamically
in the limited time between formation and fragmentation. Recent years have therefore seen in-
creased explorations of new alternatives though so far only a part of the full range of possibilities
have been explicitly addressed [64, 65].

The default modelling of colour ﬂow in PYTHIA 8 [66], which is the one used by the baseline
Monash tune [59], is as follows: the partons of each MPI system are either allowed to form their
own “skeleton” in colour space or, with a user-modiﬁable probability, they are merged with the
colour structure of a higher-p⊥ MPI system. In the latter case, each parton from the lower-p⊥
system is merged onto a string piece of the higher-p⊥ system where it will cause the least increase
in total string length. Within the context of this model, the minimisation of string length is likely
to be a physically reasonable dynamical principle, representing potential-energy minimisation,
but there is no a priori basis for guessing precisely what reconnection-probability to choose, nor
whether it should be constant at all CM energies.

More recently, a model that attempts to anchor itself more ﬁrmly in QCD was proposed [65],
which we here label “Monash + New CR” (cf. tab. 1). It uses an approximation to the full group-
theoretical weights from SU(3) to compute the probabilities for alternative string topologies at
the subleading-NC level, and is again combined with a dynamical selection favouring topologies
with low string lengths. A novel feature of this model is that it allows for “string junctions”
(colour-epsilon and -anti-epsilon structures) to form, which, combined with PYTHIA’s model
for junction fragmentation [67], furnishes a new source of baryon production. Moreover, since
it is the global colour structure of the event which gives rise to these additional baryons, their
correlations (and net baryon-antibaryon compensation) can happen over longer distances than is
the case for the conventional (local) baryon-production mechanisms in the string model.

3Exceptions are elastic and low-mass diffractive scatterings, which are modelled without a perturbative era.

5

In both cases, the fragmentation parameters of the string model are constrained by LEP
data [59, 65]. In particular, this means that the strangeness fraction is essentially ﬁxed, modulo
phase-space constraints and potential trigger-bias effects. The same is true for baryon production
in the baseline CR model, while, in the New CR model, the baryon fraction can increase with the
amount of CR. Exotic heavy baryons can also be formed, containing multiple charm or bottom
quarks.

2.2 DIPSY and rope hadronisation
DIPSY [68] implements Mueller’s dipole cascade model [69] which operates in transverse co-
ordinate space (unlike conventional showers which operate in momentum space).
Instead of
conventional PDFs, the model starts from an explicit representation of each proton being com-
posed of three colour dipoles in impact-parameter space and rapidity. These are then evolved in
rapidity space via iterated gluon emission, forming a dipole cascade. The resulting partonic ﬁnal
states are hadronised using the Lund string model, via an interface to PYTHIA 8 [31].

The recently developed rope extension to DIPSY [70] allows geometrically nearby strings to
act as a combined “colour rope”, which can hadronise with a higher intrinsic tension. The con-
sequences are larger p⊥ kicks (relative to the string direction, which for soft-particle production
in pp collisions largely coincides with the z-axis) and production of more strange hadrons and
baryons, the latter via probabilistic collapses of ropes to string junctions. The model also incor-
porates a mechanism called ﬁnal-state “swing”, which acts to minimise the masses of ﬁnal-state
colour-dipoles via colour reconnections, driven by SU(3) colour rules combined with an ad-hoc
probabilistic evolution kernel.

To provide a reference case without these effects, we also include a “NoSwing” tune of

DIPSY where the ﬁnal-state rope and swing mechanisms are switched off.

2.3 EPOS and hydrodynamic core hadronisation
The EPOS MC [71] takes a Parton-Based Gribov Regge theory approach to event generation [72].
String hadronisation in EPOS is treated differently based on the local density of string segments
per unit volume with respect to a critical-density parameter. Each string is classiﬁed as being in
either a low density coronal region or in a high density core region.

Corona hadronisation proceeds via unmodiﬁed string fragmentation whereas the core is sub-
jected to a hydrodynamic evolution; i.e. it is hadronised including additional contributions from
√
longitudinal and radial ﬂow effects [73]. Core conditions are easily satisﬁed in ion collisions,
however even for an average pp collision (Nch = 30,|η| < 2.4) at
s = 7 TeV, around 30% of
central particle production arises from the core region. This rises to 75% for Nch = 100.

The EPOS LHC [74] tune considered here is a dedicated parameter set used to describe all
LHC energies and incident particles. A loss of particle multiplicity due to radial ﬂow rescaling is
a feature needed to model ion collisions, however such effects are not observed in pp collisions.
To compensate, the LHC tune adds an additional parametrisation which modiﬁes the radial ﬂow
of the small, dense cores typical of pp interactions to ﬁx the cluster mass and hence maintain

6

the particle multiplicity. The total momentum is then rescaled after the radial boost to preserve
energy conservation.

3 Observables

Fiducial cuts are applied to the MC generator output to approximate experimental sensitivity and
this results in an inclusive set of particles formed of two components. The ‘prompt charged’
component of the inclusive set consists of charged particles with p⊥ > 200 MeV, |η| < 2.5,
lifetime τ > 300 ps and which are not created from the decay of a state with 30 < τ < 300
ps. This set is dominantly π±, K±, p and ¯p. The deﬁnition is based around the ATLAS ﬁducial
selection in ref. [75]. The second component consists of ‘identiﬁable prompt strange hadrons’;
here both charged and neutral strange hadrons are included if they typically undergo weak decay
to one or more charged particles. These states are also required to satisfy p⊥ > 200 MeV,
|η| < 2.5 and for themselves to not be created from the decay of other states with 30 < τ < 300
ps4. This set is comprised of K 0

s , Λ, ¯Λ, Ξ±, Σ±, ¯Σ± and Ω±.

Track jets are clustered from prompt charged and prompt identiﬁable strange hadrons. They
are reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm [76] using radius parameter R = 0.4, the leading jet
is required to be within |η| < 2.3.

3.1 Underlying Event Observables
Standard Underlying Event nomenclature is used with respect to the leading track jet in the event
as illustrated in ﬁg. 1. In this note we will consider quantities constructed from particles only in
the transverse region as this region is least affected by contributions from the leading 2 → 2 hard
scatter.

The following variables are considered within the transverse region, these are common vari-
ables used to parametrise the underlying event as they probe the activity level and both the size
and shape of the particle p⊥ distribution. The (cid:104)(cid:105) notation implies an average over all events:

• (cid:104)NInc.(cid:105): The event-averaged multiplicity of the inclusive set of particles (prompt charged

plus prompt identiﬁable strange hadrons).

• (cid:104)N (X)(cid:105): The event-averaged multiplicity of identiﬁed particle(s), X.

• (cid:104)(cid:80) p⊥(cid:105): The event-averaged scalar sum of the transverse momentum of the inclusive set

of particles.

• (cid:104)mean p⊥(cid:105): The event-averaged mean p⊥ of the inclusive set of particles.
• (cid:104)RMS(cid:105): The event-averaged root mean square p⊥ of the inclusive set of particles, deﬁned

here for a given multiplicity, NInc., as (cid:104)RMS(cid:105) =(cid:112)(cid:104)(cid:80) p2⊥(cid:105) /NInc..

4So for example Λ originating from Ξ− decay are excluded.

3.2 Relative Transverse Activity Classiﬁer, RT
Above a lower threshold corresponding to the onset of the UE plateau in the transverse region
(roughly, p⊥lead > 10 GeV), the mean values of UE quantities calculated over the full inclusive
set of particles have little dependence on the leading track-jet p⊥: the multiple soft scatters which
contribute the majority of the UE are largely independent of the leading jet. The slow rise of the
UE plateau in the transverse region is understood to be due to additional contributions from
wide-angle radiation associated with the hard scatter, but this effect becomes signiﬁcant only for
jet p⊥ > 50 GeV [23]. In this study, we focus on events just above the onset of the plateau, with
10 GeV < p⊥lead < 30 GeV.

The shape of the leading track-jet p⊥ spectrum in the various MC generators considered is
shown in ﬁg. 2a. Dashed vertical lines indicate the leas p⊥ range used in this study. The DIPSY
tunes clearly exhibit a signiﬁcantly harder jet p⊥ spectrum than PYTHIA 8 or EPOS. However,
when we consider the average inclusive-particle yields in the transverse region, shown in ﬁg. 2b,
we observe that the activity in the transverse region is roughly constant and quite comparable
between the models, independently of the jet p⊥ spectrum. We therefore stress that any mis-
modelling in the absolute rate of jet events is expected to have little effect on the results in this
study due to the proﬁled mean normalisation. Note that the most extreme variant of DIPSY
NOSWING does exhibit a delayed onset of the (cid:104)NInc.(cid:105) plateau. In the context of an experimental
analysis, the robustness of the conclusions could be explicitly validated by comparing with one
or more higher jet p⊥ windows, say 20-40 GeV and/or 30-50 GeV, statistics allowing.
Although average quantities like (cid:104)NInc.(cid:105) in ﬁg. 2b do not vary considerably with p⊥ over this
range of jet energies, the distributions underlying these mean values can be very broad. The full
probability distribution of NInc. is shown in ﬁg. 3, integrated over all events with leading track-jet

region as a function of leading track-jet p⊥. Dashed vertical lines indicate the p⊥ range used in
this paper.

Gaussians (Γ (cid:29) (cid:112)(cid:104)NInc.(cid:105)) are typical in minimum-bias and underlying-event studies. They

p⊥ values in the range 10 – 30 GeV. Such very broad distributions with tails much wider than

imply that there is a very large dynamic range between transverse-region activities signiﬁcantly
larger or smaller than the mean. Given that the approximately constant average UE level is by
now well established, we believe that these extremes, which are typically hidden in studies of
‘average’ UE properties, are the next natural focus of study.

In order to obtain an axis which allows for the investigation of the modelling of proton in-
teractions as a function of the event activity, we reclassify events with a leading track jet in the
range 10 ≤ p⊥ < 30 GeV based on their per-event transverse activity with respect to the mean:

RT =

NInc.
(cid:104)NInc.(cid:105).

(1)

We ﬁnd this normalisation choice (which in minimum-bias contexts is referred to as the KNO
variable [77]) to be useful since RT = 1 then cleanly divides events with “higher-than-average”
UE from “lower-than-average” ones, irrespective of CM energy or applied cuts. We note however
that an absolute normalisation would be the preferred choice for determining, e.g., whether events
with a ﬁxed number of particles behave the same at all CM energies.

For each MC model, the value of the denominator in eq. (1) corresponds to the mean values
of the distributions in ﬁg. 3, which are tabulated in tab. 2. All models predict a mean transverse
multiplicity in the range 21–26 and a width of around 13 (where Poissonian ﬂuctuations would

predict a much smaller width, ∼ √

25 = 5).

Measuring UE quantities versus RT yields sensitivity to rare events with exceptionally large
or small transverse activity with respect to the average event. The lower requirement on the
leading track-jet p⊥ acts to suppress soft-periphery and diffractive interactions by ensuring that

a hard scatter was present while the upper requirement limits the contamination by wide-angle
radiation off the hard scatter which increases slowly with the p⊥ of the leading jet [23].

In the context of MPI models, the case where only a small amount of energy is deposited in
the transverse region implies that only a small number of MPI occurred in that event. This there-
fore affords an opportunity to measure event properties in an ‘MPI-suppressed’ environment,
where fragmentation properties may be closer to those of e+e− collisions than the average pp jet
event.

In the other extreme where the activity in an event is many times larger than the mean, new
dynamic effects may become signiﬁcant. Some different models which may give rise to modiﬁed
behaviour in dense pp interactions were discussed in sec. 2. Such modiﬁcations may be important
in describing effects already observed in data such as [56, 78] and [49], and it is important to
develop further probes that shed light on how these effects develop as we move from dilute to
dense environments.
Illustrated in ﬁg. 4 are the average number of parton-parton interactions (MPI) and the av-
erage transverse proton-proton impact parameter (cid:104)bMPI(cid:105), with the latter normalised such that
1 corresponds to the impact parameter of an average minimum-bias event. Both are plotted
as a function of log10(RT) for four different tunes of PYTHIA 8. For the most active events

(log10(RT) = 0.5 corresponding to RT =
average number of MPI increases by roughly a factor 2 relative to the mean (at log10(RT) = 0),
and the events are roughly twice as central as the average in this jet p⊥ window (which in turn
are twice as central as the average minimum-bias event). For low-activity events, with less than
a tenth of the average UE activity, log10(RT) < −1, an average of less than 2 MPI per event are

predicted by these models, with an average impact parameter even larger than for minimum-bias
events, (cid:104)bMPI(cid:105) > 1 for log10(RT) < −0.5. According to these models, our axis thus allows us
to scan over almost an order of magnitude in both the average number of MPI and the average
impact parameter, for ﬁxed jet p⊥.

For completeness, we note that relative UE activity could also have been classiﬁed using
summed transverse-region p⊥ or by using the jet median/area techniques referred to in the intro-
duction. Our choice of NInc. was based on two factors: ﬁrstly, we have a very direct relation with
charged-particle multiplicity based minimum-bias studies of similar quantities, and secondly the
fact that heavier hadrons exhibit harder p⊥ spectra can lead to undesirable biases in a classiﬁer

based on(cid:80) p⊥. For example a low(cid:80) p⊥ UE would be biased to be made up entirely of pions

since these have the softest spectra. Such biases would complicate the interpretation of effects
we wish to study such as any evolution in total strangeness and baryon fractions.

As a precursor to the main study of identiﬁed-particle ratios, we ﬁrst consider the evolution of

of the inclusive set of particles are plotted as a function of RT. The averages and widths of the
inclusive p⊥ spectra are investigated in ﬁg. 6. The DIPSY ROPE tune generates events with the
highest overall average energy density followed by EPOS and PYTHIA 8. For DIPSY ROPE this
is observed to be due to a similar average particle multiplicity as for PYTHIA 8 combined with
a 20% harder mean p⊥ distribution and a similarly larger RMS. The DIPSY NOSWING tune has
both the lowest average multiplicity spectra and energy density of the models, its mean p⊥ is
similar to that of PYTHIA 8.

Only minor differences are observed for PYTHIA 8 with the new colour-reconnection model

with respect to the standard Monash tune in these distributions.

Identiﬁed Particle Results

The production of identiﬁed particles is useful to investigate the evolution of the underlying event
as a function of transverse activity levels in the event. The strange and baryon contents of the
ﬁnal state arising from non-perturbative effects are expected to be particularly sensitive to the
modeling described in section 2.

We normalise distributions to factor out any contribution from differences in the overall mul-
tiplicity spectra of the generators and focus on ratios of particle yields, with the total yield of
inclusive particles discussed in the previous section. Crucially, this also highlights any changes
in the relative suppression of identiﬁed particles, with respect to the inclusive sum. The meson
fractions are plotted in ﬁg. 7. The ratio of charged pions to inclusive particles is given ﬁrst as
the latter is used subsequently for normalisation as it is experimentally easier to access. The
π± fraction is observed to fall from 76–79% at low RT to 72–77% at high RT, with the lowest
fractions in EPOS and DIPSY ROPE at high RT as expected due to increased strange and baryon
production in these models as a function of RT. PYTHIA 8 Monash + New CR, which does
not incorporate strangeness enhancement but does allow for baryon enhancement, also exhibits
a statistically signiﬁcant drop.

A baseline increase in the kaon fraction with RT due to phase space effects
is observed for the PYTHIA 8 Monash and DIPSY NOSWING tunes. EPOS predicts a signiﬁcant
strange meson enhancement at high RT whereas DIPSY ROPE predict an enhancement for all
RT, in both cases it reaches 5–10%. Interestingly PYTHIA 8 Monash + new CR exhibits slightly
lower charged- and neutral- kaon fractions at all RT. This is likely to be due to a smaller baseline
strangeness fraction in that tune combined with a tendency of the model to create a large number
of low-mass string systems in which the production of high-mass hadrons (including strange
ones) is suppressed due to phase-space restrictions.

When the ratio of the doubly-strange φ(s¯s) meson multiplicity is taken with respect to that of
s in ﬁg. 7d, the new CR model in PYTHIA 8 does not produce additional φ
the singly-strange K 0
and is also in agreement with DIPSY NOSWING. Both DIPSY ROPE and EPOS however, which
both incorporate explicit strangeness enhancement, are shown to produce considerably more φ
on average, up to 30% for DIPSY ROPE and 75% for EPOS with respect to PYTHIA 8.

The baryonic enhancement is probed in ﬁg. 8. In ﬁg. 8a the p¯p multiplicity is normalised to
the inclusive charged multiplicity. Some phase-space effects are apparent in all MCs with the
smallest rise in proton enhancement coming from PYTHIA 8 and DIPSY NOSWING. In EPOS the
magnitude of the enhancement is steepest as a function of RT leading it to be in agreement with
PYTHIA 8 and DIPSY NOSWING only for low values of RT. PYTHIA 8 + new CR and DIPSY
ROPE both predict signiﬁcant enhancement, with up to a 50% increase in proton fraction relative
to their simpler model tunes.

By normalising the proton yield to the charged-kaon yield, in ﬁg. 8b, we obtain a probe that
is sensitive to any relative enhancement between baryons and strangeness. PYTHIA 8 Monash
+ new CR exhibits the highest ratio, as expected since it incorporates a mechanism for baryon
enhancement but no mechanism for strangeness enhancement. Next highest is DIPSY ROPE, due
to a baryon enhancement signiﬁcantly larger than its strange meson enhancement. We note that
in EPOS, the two effects are of the same magnitude in both sectors - making it similar to the
baseline models, PYTHIA 8 and DIPSY NOSWING in this observable.

In ﬁg. 8c strange-baryon enhancement is plotted in the ratio of Λ¯Λ hyperons to K 0

s . The
proﬁle is similar to that of the proton enhancement except that all of EPOS, DIPSY ROPE and
PYTHIA 8 + new CR are in reasonable agreement and show up to a 90% enhancement effect
with increasing RT.

Finally doubly-strange Ξ± baryons are investigated in ﬁg. 8d normalised to the Λ¯Λ multiplic-
ity spectra. A clear enhancement with increasing RT is observed only for EPOS; other models
do not predict a strong rise however DIPSY ROPE predicts a slightly larger baseline fraction of
doubly-strange to singly-strange baryons.

6 Conclusions
A new axis for underlying-event studies RT = NInc./(cid:104)NInc.(cid:105) is proposed to be used as an alter-
nate to leading-object p⊥ for events which contain at least one hard scatter and are hence on the
‘underlying event plateau’. RT isolates events with exceptionally large or small activity in the
transverse underlying event region with respect to the event-averaged mean. Distributions which

Identiﬁed-particle ratios (strangeness and in particular baryon fractions) are observed to be
highly sensitive to the event activity density with a marked increase in average p¯p/NInc. and
Λ¯Λ/K 0

model, DIPSY ROPE and EPOS when compared to models with a less detailed treatment, PYTHIA

Distributions are also presented for K, φ and Ξ± resonances.
These distributions are experimentally accessible at the LHC and would allow for discrim-
ination between alternate colour-reconnection, colour “rope” and hydrodynamic modelling of
dense proton-proton interactions.
