Macroscopic Matter in Lorentz Gauge Theory of Gravity

Ahmad Borzou‚àó

Physics Department, Baylor University, Waco, TX 76798-7316, USA

(Dated: March 8, 2016)

We study macroscopic matters in the recently developed Lorentz gauge theory of gravity and,
based on the exact source Ô¨Åeld that is already derived, introduce a classically valid source Ô¨Åeld which
makes further macroscopic studies practically doable. By studying a static matter distribution in the
linear order of the perturbation theory, the approximate formulation of the source Ô¨Åeld is found and
its non-linear form is justiÔ¨Åed. Next the general nonlinear source Ô¨Åeld is introduced and is utilized to
study an incompressible spherical star. It is shown that although the interior Schwarzschild space-
time is an exact solution, it can‚Äôt be physically understood within the framework of this theory.
Finally, we present a numerical solution for the interior of a star and analytically show that, to the
Ô¨Årst order of perturbation, it is consistent with the interior Schwarzschild space-time.

1.

INTRODUCTION

The standard model, which is until now the best known description of the fundamental Ô¨Åelds, is a gauge theory
of the group SU (3) √ó SU (2) √ó U (1), a geometry of internal spaces over the space-time, and except gravity explains
all the forces of the nature. In the standard model the connections, known as the gauge bosons, are the dynamical
variables and as a result their Lagrangians are polynomials of order four and consequently their theories are successfully
renormalizable. On the other hand general relativity (GR) is a Poincare gauge theory. However, despite being a gauge
theory, the metric, and not the connections, is the dynamical variable here. If one expands the metric around a classical
background, a polynomial of inÔ¨Ånite orders will be reached and as one goes to higher orders in the perturbation, the
theory becomes more and more divergent. A review of these ultraviolet divergences can be found in [1]. It is therefore
legitimate to search for a gauge formulation of gravity based on geometry of internal spaces over space-time. This
avenue of research was opened by the works of Utiyama, Sciama, and Kibble [2‚Äì4]. A thorough review of the subject
can be found in [5, 6]. There has been a glaring progress in this area of research but gravity has not been incorporated
into the standard model until now.

In [7] we have introduced a framework in which metric remains non-dynamical. In this work, it is shown that the
degree of divergence does not increase if one tries to calculate higher and higher orders of perturbation. Therefore,
the theory remains predictable at high energies. We also found two exact vacuum solutions of the theory. However,
problems in which matter content is not negligible, specially in the macroscopic scales, were ignored to some extend.
It was shown that the source in the Ô¨Åeld equations takes the following form

where T¬µi is the energy-momentum tensor and Œæ is a local vector deÔ¨Åned with respect to a local point X Œ± and Œ¥ is a
very small, perhaps subatomic, length. To interpret this equation, we divide the space-time into tiny spheres of radius
Œ¥ and label the center of Nth sphere by X Œ±
, as is shown in Ô¨Ågure (1). Hence, this form of the source Ô¨Åeld is more
appropriate for microscopic calculations. Therefore, when working on macroscopic problems, a source like (1) that
contains small scale objects is not convenient at all. Moreover, due to the extremely non-uniform nature of Œæ, it is not
possible to assume a highly symmetric space-time under this source. The non-uniformity of this vector can be seen if
one moves a distance longer than Œ¥ away from X Œ±. In this paper we would like to Ô¨Ånd an approximate source Ô¨Åeld
which is more convenient for large scale problems. The idea is to neglect the gravitational eÔ¨Äects at small distances,
comparable to Œ¥, and Ô¨Ånd a more uniform, but only classically valid, source Ô¨Åeld. In order to achieve this, we sum
the gravitational Ô¨Åelds of the matter distribution inside a sphere of radius Œ¥ and neglect the gravitational Ô¨Åelds inside
the sphere. This, as will be shown below, enables us to Ô¨Ånd an equivalent source Ô¨Åeld that holds for distances larger
than Œ¥.

The present paper is organized as follows. A brief review of the Lorentz gauge theory of gravity is presented in
section 2. In section 3 a static matter is studied within the context of the linearized Lorentz gauge theory where the
macroscopic version of the source Ô¨Åeld is derived in detail. Source Ô¨Åeld for a general non-linear matter distribution is
introduced in section 4 where the interior of an incompressible star is studied. A conclusion is drawn at the end in
section 5.

2. LORENTZ GAUGE THEORY OF GRAVITY

The Lorentz gauge theory is a formulation of gravity in which metric has a non-dynamical role and is brieÔ¨Çy

reviewed in this section. For the details we refer redears to [7].

The equivalence principle implies that there is a free falling frame at any point in space-time which is both a Lorentz
and a coordinate frame. Therefore tetrad Ô¨Åeld can be divided into a part which contains the angle between the free
falling frame and that associated with the arbitrarily chosen coordinates and the part that contains the angle between
the free falling frame and the arbitrarily chosen Lorentz frame. Mathematically this means

ei¬µ = Œ∑

¬Øk¬Ølei¬Øke¬Øl¬µ,

(2)

where the free falling frame is shown with a bar while the Latin indices indicate the Lorentz frame and the Greek
ones refer to the coordinate system. Either of the two tetrad constituents can be dynamical. Namely,

(cid:40)

Œ¥ei¬µ = Œ∑¬Øk¬Ølei¬ØkŒ¥e¬Øl¬µ Case I,
Œ¥ei¬µ = Œ∑¬Øk¬ØlŒ¥ei¬Øke¬Øl¬µ Case II.

(3)

General relativity is based on the Ô¨Årst case. The Lorentz gauge theory is built upon the second one and develops no
dynamics in the metric because

g¬µŒΩ = Œ∑ijei¬µejŒΩ = Œ∑¬Øi¬Øje¬Øi¬µe¬ØjŒΩ.

(cid:90)

(cid:104)LM + LC + LA

(cid:105)

Therefore, Œ¥g¬µŒΩ = 0 in the latter case. The Lorentz gauge theory is deÔ¨Åned by the following action

where e is the determinant of the tetrad Ô¨Åeld, LM is the Dirac Lagrangian, LC is just the tetrad postulate, D¬µeiŒΩ = 0,

with S¬µŒΩi being a Lagrange multiplier and eiŒΩ being the tetrad Ô¨Åeld. Finally, LA, is the gauge Ô¨Åeld‚Äôs Lagrangian [8, 9]

3. CLASSICAL MATTER IN A LINEAR STATIC CASE

A static linear approximation of a non-linear theory is perhaps the easiest problem that besides its simplicity can
reveal most of the basic concepts of the theory without engaging the complexities of a generally non-linear time
dependent problem. By deÔ¨Åning h¬µŒΩ as

h¬µŒΩ ‚â° g¬µŒΩ ‚àí Œ∑¬µŒΩ,

(16)

where g¬µŒΩ is the inverse of the metric and Œ∑¬µŒΩ is the Minkowskian metric, we can rearrange the Ô¨Åeld equations (15)
in the following way

Œ∑Œ±ŒΩDŒ±F¬µŒΩij = c‚àí1

5 J¬µij ‚àí hŒ±ŒΩDŒ±F¬µŒΩij,

(17)

 ùë•  ùëã ‚Ä≤ùëÅ O Œ¥ ùúâ  which can be written as

where the following is used

DŒ±F¬µŒΩij = ‚àÇŒ±F¬µŒΩij ‚àí {ŒìŒ≤

Œ±¬µFŒ≤ŒΩij + ŒìŒ≤

Œ±ŒΩF¬µŒ≤ij + A k

i Œ±F¬µŒΩkj + A k

j Œ±F¬µŒΩik}.

Using (8), this equation can be further expanded as
Œ∑Œ±ŒΩ‚àÇŒ±‚àÇŒΩAij¬µ ‚àí Œ∑Œ±ŒΩ‚àÇŒ±‚àÇ¬µAijŒΩ = c‚àí1

(23)

At this point we need to pause for a while and model the mathematical expression in equation (14). One possible
model is that the space-time is made of extremely small cells, spheres of radius Œ¥. Inside each cell we can deÔ¨Åne a local
position vector, (cid:126)Œæ, which is deÔ¨Åned with respect to the center of that cell as is shown in Ô¨Ågure (1). The gravitational
Ô¨Åeld of the Nth cell is

(cid:90) d3x(cid:48)(cid:48)J¬µij(x(cid:48)(cid:48))

as is shown in Ô¨Ågure (1), and the the integral is over the interior of the cell. Therefore (24) can be rewritten as

Due to the linearity of Ô¨Åeld equations, we can add the gravity of all the cells and Ô¨Ånd the total Ô¨Åled

Here the zero is because in a classical problem the gravitational Ô¨Åeld inside the cells can be neglected which implies
that all the observers that are at rest with respect to the center are simultaneous, i.e., Œæ0 = 0. As far as a classical
matter is concerned, the energy-momentum tensor can be assumed constant within the cells and therefore

We now try to Ô¨Ånd the gravitational Ô¨Åeld inside and outside of a sphere of radius R Ô¨Ålled with a dust where only
the temporal component of T¬µi is non-zero, T00 = ‚àíœÅ. We also assume that the density, œÅ, is constant and locate the

The Ô¨Åeld should be zero at inÔ¨Ånity and should not diverge at the center. To Ô¨Ånd the boundary condition at r = R,
one needs to integrate equation (49)

which, using Gauss‚Äô theorem, is

(cid:90)

œÅda/i .

Knowing that (cid:126)A is radial, we can solve the integral over the region shown by Ô¨Ågure (2)

‚àÇrAr|R+ ‚àí ‚àÇrAr|R‚àí = ‚àí4œÄGœÅ,

7

FIG. 2: The imaginary volume deÔ¨Åned at the boundary that separates inside the sphere Ô¨Ålled by dust from the empty space
outside.

which is the last piece of the boundary conditions. Now, we need to solve the Ô¨Åeld equation (49) knowing that, except
at the boundary r = R, the source is everywhere zero

‚àá2 (cid:126)A = 0.

(53)

It is now easy to verify that equation (48) satisÔ¨Åes this equation as well as the boundary conditions.

To Ô¨Ånd the Newtonian gravitational force, we start with the geodesic equation, D¬µ Àôxi = 0, or consequently

(54)
After neglecting the spatial components of velocity, and inserting Àôx¬µ=0 = ‚àí1 and Àôxj=0 = 1, which is correct in the
lowest order of perturbation

j¬µ Àôxj Àôx¬µ = 0.

This can be written in the Ô¨Ånal form

(56)

This shows that both the interior and exterior Schwarzschild space-times are the linear order solutions.

4. CLASSICAL MATTER IN A GENERAL CASE

In the preceding section we derived a formulation for the classical matter in a linear static case. Here we would
like to construct an analogous classical source for a non-linear and non-static problem by utilizing the principle of
minimal coupling and replacing the partial derivative in (43) by a covariant derivative and write the general classical
source as

J¬µij = DjT¬µi ‚àí DiT¬µj,

where Di = e ¬µ

i D¬µ and consequently write the classical Ô¨Åeld equations as

DŒΩF ¬µŒΩij = 4œÄGJ ¬µij.

(57)

(58)

We also can argue that the classical source J¬µij should contain the energy momentum tensor which has only two
indices, and therefore an object with only one index is needed to build a three index tensor. On the other hand the
only classical space-time related tensorial object with a single index is a covariant derivative. Moreover, the covariant

 ùëõÃÇ 8

derivative and the energy-momentum tensor should be arranged such that the anti-symmetry property of J¬µij is
preserved.

The conservation law of the classical source implies that

D¬µJ ¬µij = 0,

(59)

which is because the left hand side of (58) is divergence free, D¬µDŒΩF ¬µŒΩij = 0.

We also would like to emphasize that the energy-momentum tensor appeared in the source Ô¨Åeld only consists of
fermionic contents. That means bosonic Ô¨Åelds, for instance electromagnetic Ô¨Åelds, do not contribute to the energy-
momentum tensor. This can be understood by investigating the Lagrangian of electrodynamics

LElec = ‚àí 1
4

F¬µŒΩF ¬µŒΩ.

(60)

We can readily observe that T i¬µ = Œ¥LElec
only through the metric, and also because Œ¥g¬µŒΩ = 0 as was explained in section 2.

Œ¥ei¬µ

= 0. This is because the tetrad Ô¨Åeld has not directly appeared here, but

4.1.

Interior Of A Spherically Symmetric Star

In the following we use the exact form of the source Ô¨Åeld to Ô¨Ånd a solution for spherical static stars, corresponding
with the interior Schwarzschild solution in GR. A spherically symmetric space-time is represented by the following
tetrad

which is the same as the one in (52) knowing that Artt = 1

Also conservation of energy-momentum tensor implies that, see [10],

In the end, a direct substitution shows that D¬µJ ¬µij = 0 is trivially satisÔ¨Åed with no further constraint.

Through equation (48) we showed that linear version of both interior and exterior Schwarzschild space-times are
consistently the solutions to the linear order Ô¨Åeld equations. Moreover, it is shown in [7] that the exterior Schwarzschild
space-time is an exact solution. Albeit the interior Schwarzschild space-time is also an exact solution here, it does
not seem to be physically understood at this time and we only mention it as an abstract one. To reach this solution
we need to assume that

This means both density and pressure are negative and leads to an extra negative sign in the right hand side of
equation (67), one also can argue that G has taken a negative sign and keep the energy-momentum tensor as in (65).
This solution together with the boundary conditions, denote a repulsive force in the exterior space and therefore does
not seem to be real. The solution can be veriÔ¨Åed by Ô¨Årst Ô¨Çipping the sign of the right hand side of (67) and then
directly substituting the followings

where œÅ is a positive constant. The solution is also veriÔ¨Åed through the numerical studies, described in the next
section, that are presented in Ô¨Ågure (3).

In the following we will derive a numerical solution for the interior of an incompressible star that is, through the
boundary conditions, consistent with the exact exterior Schwarzschild space-time. From equation (48) it is expected
that this solution is consistent with the interior Schwarzschild solution at least to the Ô¨Årst order.

4.2. A Numerical Solution to the Interior of an Incompressible Star

In this section we would like to numerically solve equations (67) and (71) using the simplest Runge-Kutta method.
We start with the set of equations in (67) and by rearranging them Ô¨Ånd an explicit expression for a(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) and b(cid:48)(cid:48). Equation
(71) is already in the desired format. To Ô¨Ånd the initial conditions we use the fact that a, a(cid:48), b, b(cid:48), and p are all
continuous at the surface of the star, r = R and use equation (70) to Ô¨Ånd a value for a(cid:48)(cid:48). We also need to use the fact
that the exterior space is governed by the exact Schwarzschild space-time. For simplicity we also set

G = M = 1,
R = 10.

(74)

Also density is a constant in terms of R and M . The initial values at the surface are given in table I.

Values of a(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), b(cid:48)(cid:48), and p(cid:48) are also known at the surface through equations (67) and (71). To determine the values of

the quantities at one step away from the surface, the following equation can be used

f (r ‚àí ‚àÜr) = f (r) ‚àí ‚àÜrf(cid:48)(r),

(75)

where f stands for p, a, a(cid:48), a(cid:48)(cid:48), b, and b(cid:48). Knowing the value of these quantities at R ‚àí ‚àÜr, one can Ô¨Ånd the values of
a(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48), b(cid:48)(cid:48), and p(cid:48) through the equations mentioned above. Now we can go further back and Ô¨Ånd the values at R ‚àí 2‚àÜr
and beyond by simply repeating the same procedure. We have programmed this algorithm in C++ and plotted using
ROOT [11]. The results are shown in Ô¨Ågure (4) where the solid line represents the numerical values and the points
show the values of (73) at a few occasional locations. The agreement between the solid lines and the dots from the
surface to r ‚àº 6 is consistent with our expectations from equation (48). Also there seems to exist a singularity at
r ‚àº 2, for which the plots are cut at this point. Study of this singularity is out of the scope of the present article and
is left for future studies.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied macroscopic matters within the framework of the Lorentz gauge theory of gravity. This study
was necessary because the exact source Ô¨Åeld introduced in [7] and mentioned in equation (15) is more convenient for
microscopic scales. The vector Ô¨Åeld Œæ introduced in the latter equation has a very non-uniform nature and varies
rapidly as one moves over the space-time, which can be seen by realizing that the magnitude and direction of Œæ
depends on where its reference point X Œ± stands and the location of these points change if one move a distance of Œ¥
away from the previous one. In Ô¨Ågure (1), the concepts are illustrated.

By Ô¨Årst investigating a linear static matter distribution, we have found an equation for the source Ô¨Åeld of the
Lorentz gauge theory that works well provided the gravitational Ô¨Åelds are negligible in distances smaller than Œ¥, which
is introduced in equation (13). Next, using the principle of minimal coupling, we have extended the source Ô¨Åeld‚Äôs
formulation to a non-linear, non-static case and have shown that it takes the following form

J ¬µij = DjT ¬µi ‚àí DiT ¬µj,

(76)

where T ¬µi is the energy-momentum tensor. This equation has been used to investigate the interior of an incompressible
star. It is shown that the interior Schwarzschild space-time is an exact solution if density and pressure are negative,
or if G takes a negative sign, and therefore can‚Äôt be physically understood. Nevertheless, by numerically solving the
Ô¨Åeld equations, we have presented a solution that is, to the Ô¨Årst order of perturbation, consistent with the interior
Schwarzschild space-time.

It has been shown that the energy-momentum tensor deÔ¨Åned as

T ¬µi =

Œ¥L
Œ¥ei¬µ

,

12

(77)

is zero for bosonic Ô¨Åelds due to the non-dynamical nature of the metric and the fact that the tetrad Ô¨Åeld does not
directly appear in the bosonic Lagrangians. Nevertheless, bosons are still aÔ¨Äected by gravity through the metric that
is coupled in their Lagrangians and light, for example, does bend under the gravitational Ô¨Åelds. The only diÔ¨Äerence
with GR is the fact that bosonic Ô¨Åelds do not gravitate with the consequence that even a charged spherical black hole
generates the Schwarzschild, rather than the Reissner-Nordstrm, metric.

Appendix A: Mathematica Code

The following pieces of Mathematica code, each enclosed by two lines, are developed to perform the calculations
presented in this paper. By pasting them into a Mathematica notebook, one should be able to reproduce the results.
We Ô¨Årst would like to emphasize that in Mathematica the indices run from 1 and not 0, therefore the temporal
components are moved to the fourth place. The code starts with the following piece

Clear[ee, e, eta, eeta, g, ggInv, gInv, coord,M, R, rho, p, a, b]
theta = Œ∏;

Next the coordinates are deÔ¨Åned

DeÔ¨Åne the tetrad, ei¬µ such that a and b are only a function of r

ee = {{Sqrt[b[r]], 0, 0, 0}, {0, r, 0, 0}, {0, 0, r * Sin[theta], 0}, {0, 0, 0, Sqrt[a[r]]}};
e[i , mu ] := e[i, mu] = ee[[i, mu]];

Both Œ∑ij and Œ∑ij, Ô¨Çat metric, are
