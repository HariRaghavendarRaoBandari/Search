Abstract Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are ideal probes of the epoch of the
ﬁrst stars and galaxies. We review the recent theoretical understanding of the
formation and evolution of the ﬁrst (so-called Population III) stars, in light of
their viability of providing GRB progenitors. We proceed to discuss possible
unique observational signatures of such bursts, based on the current formation
scenario of long GRBs. These include signatures related to the prompt emission
mechanism, as well as to the afterglow radiation, where the surrounding inter-
galactic medium might imprint a telltale absorption spectrum. We emphasize
important remaining uncertainties in our emerging theoretical framework.

1 Introduction

With recent progress in observational cosmology, one of the key frontiers is
to understand how the ﬁrst stars and galaxies ended the cosmic dark ages
a few hundred million years after the Big Bang (Bromm et al. 2009; Loeb
2010). Prior to their emergence, the universe exhibited a simple state, devoid
of complex structure, of any elements heavier than lithium, and of high-energy
radiation ﬁelds. Within ΛCDM cosmology, the ﬁrst stars, the so-called Pop-
ulation III (Pop III), are predicted to form at z ∼ 20 − 30 in dark matter

minihalos of mass ∼ 106M⊙. The formation of the ﬁrst bona-ﬁde galaxies, be-
ing able to host long-lived stellar systems, may be delayed until more massive
dark matter halos virialize (Bromm & Yoshida 2011). Once the ﬁrst sources
of light have appeared on the cosmic scene, the universe was rapidly trans-
formed through the input of ionizing radiation (Barkana & Loeb 2007) and
heavy chemical elements (Karlsson et al. 2013). The character of this funda-
mental transition, as well as the assembly process of the ﬁrst galaxies, crucially
depended on the feedback exerted by Pop III stars (Ciardi & Ferrara 2005).
The feedback in turn is determined by the initial mass function (IMF) of the
ﬁrst stars (Bromm & Larson 2004; Glover 2005). Although important uncer-
tainties remain, the key prediction is that the Pop III IMF is biased towards
high mass, implying a top-heavy distribution (Bromm 2013). At least a frac-
tion of the ﬁrst stars could therefore have collapsed into massive black holes
(BHs) at the end of their short lives, and thus provide viable gamma-ray burst
(GRB) progenitors.

Upcoming facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and
the next generation of extremely-large telescopes on the ground (GMT, TMT,
E-ELT) promise to open up a direct window into the ﬁrst billion years of cosmic
evolution (Gardner et al. 2006). Despite their exquisite sensitivity at near-IR
wavelengths, even these observatories may not be able to directly probe the
ﬁrst stars, unless they formed in massive clusters (Pawlik et al. 2011), or were
gravitationally lensed (Rydberg et al. 2013). The only opportunity to probe
individual Pop III stars may be to catch them at the moment of their explosive
death. This could involve extremely energetic supernova (SN) events, such
as hypernovae or pair-instability SNe (Hummel et al. 2012; Pan et al. 2012;
Whalen et al. 2013), or GRBs. The latter fate depends on whether Pop III
stars could give rise to suitable collapsar progenitors, involving rapidly rotating
massive stars (MacFadyen & Woosley 1999). Since Pop III stars are predicted
to fulﬁll both requirements (see the discussion below), GRBs are expected
to be prevalent at very high redshifts. Indeed, GRBs may play a key role in
elucidating primordial star formation, as well as the properties of the early
intergalactic medium (IGM), given their extreme intrinsic brightness, both of
the prompt γ-ray emission, as well as that of the prolonged afterglow.

A number of features render GRBs ideal probes of the epoch of ﬁrst light
(Loeb 2010): (i) Traditional sources to observe the high-z universe, such as
quasars and Lyman-α emitting galaxies, severely suﬀer from the eﬀects of cos-
mological dimming. It was suggested, on the other hand, that GRB afterglows,
if observed at a ﬁxed time after the trigger, may exhibit nearly-ﬂat infrared
ﬂuxes out to very high z (Ciardi & Loeb 2000). The argument behind this
counter-intuitive eﬀect was as follows: A ﬁxed time interval in the observer
frame translates into an increasingly early time in the source frame. Such ear-
lier times in turn would sample the rapidly decaying GRB lightcurve at the
moment of maximal brightness, thus compensating for the cosmological dim-
ming (increasing luminosity distance). With the realization that such simple
power-law decay may not be established until quite late after the trigger, this
distance independence of the high-z burst ﬂux now appears too optimistic.

(ii) In the hierarchical setting of cosmic structure formation, earlier times
are dominated by lower-mass host systems. The massive hosts required for
quasars and bright galaxies therefore are dying out at the highest redshifts
(Morlock et al. 2011). GRBs, on the other hand, mark the death of individual
stars, which can form even in very low-mass systems. (iii) Finally, Pop III
GRBs would provide very clean background sources to probe the early IGM.
Again reﬂecting the low masses of their hosts, any proximity eﬀect should
be much reduced, as ionized bubbles are conﬁned to the immediate vicinity
of the Pop III system; the IGM would thus largely remain unperturbed. In
addition, since GRB afterglow spectra can be described as featureless, broken
power-laws (Vreeswijk et al. 2004), any signature imprinted by absorption and
emission events along a given line of sight can be easily discerned.

The outlook for GRB cosmology, therefore, is bright, provided that we can
continue to ﬂy wide-ﬁeld γ-ray trigger instruments in space, beyond the end of
the Swift satellite. We already have tantalizing examples of high-redshift bursts
with the spectroscopically conﬁrmed GRB 090423 at z ≃ 8.2 (Salvaterra et al.
2009; Tanvir et al. 2009), and the photometrically detected GRB 090429B at
z ≃ 9.4 (Cucchiara et al. 2011). Future missions, such as SVOM (Paul et al.
2011), promise to fully unleash the potential of GRBs to probe the early uni-
verse. This review is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the recent
consensus on the formation of the ﬁrst stars, with a particular focus on as-
sessing their suitability as GRB progenitors. In Section 3, we continue by
summarizing the key stellar evolution physics of these suggested Pop III pro-
genitors. In Section 4, we discuss promising observational avenues to probe
the signature of Pop III GRBs, and end with a brief outlook into the fu-
ture in Section 5. In concluding, we would like to refer the reader to two
recent reviews, one providing a comprehensive perspective on modern GRB
astrophysics (Kumar & Zhang 2015), and the other a concise summary of the
lessons from the Swift era for GRB cosmology (Salvaterra 2015).

2 Formation of Population III stars

The longstanding consensus view has been that the conditions in the early
universe favored the formation of predominantly massive stars, such that the
Pop III IMF was top-heavy (Abel et al. 2002; Bromm et al. 2002; Bromm & Larson
2004). This expectation rests on the much less eﬃcient cooling in pure H/He
gas, where the only viable cooling agent is molecular hydrogen. The primordial
gas can therefore reach temperatures of only ∼ 200 K, compared to the 10 K
reached in dust-cooled molecular clouds in the present-day Milky Way. The
correspondingly enhanced thermal pressure is reﬂected in a Jeans mass that is
larger by one to two orders of magnitude in the Pop III case. Another element
of this “standard model” of primordial star formation has been that the ﬁrst
stars formed typically in isolation, one per minihalo (Omukai & Nishi 1999).
In recent years, this traditional paradigm has been reﬁned in important
ways (Turk et al. 2009; Stacy et al. 2010; Clark et al. 2011; Greif et al. 2011,

4

Kenji Toma et al.

2012). Supercomputing power, as well as algorithmic advances, now enable
us to follow the protostellar collapse to densities, n ∼ 1022 cm−3, where the
initial hydrostatic core forms in the center of the cloud (Yoshida et al. 2008).
Crucially, the computations can now also be extended into the main accretion
phase (Omukai & Palla 2003). An important lesson has been that accretion
is mediated through a near-Keplerian disk, similar to present-day star forma-
tion. The hot conditions in the surrounding cloud result in extremely large
rates of infall onto the disk ( ˙M ∝ T 3/2); this rapid mass-loading drives the
disk inevitably towards gravitational instability, such that a small multiple of
Pop III protostars emerges, often dominated by a binary system. It is not yet
possible to extend such ab-initio simulations all the way to the completion of
the protostellar assembly process; the ﬁnal mass of Pop III stars and their ﬁnal
IMF are thus still subject to considerable uncertainty. However, ﬁrst attempts
to carry out the radiation-hydrodynamical calculations required to treat the
late accretion phase, where protostellar feedback tends to limit further infall,
have conﬁrmed the basic prediction: the ﬁrst stars were typically massive, with
masses of a few ∼ 10M⊙, although rarely very massive (> 100M⊙), as previ-
ously thought, forming as a member of small multiple systems (McKee & Tan
2008; Hosokawa et al. 2011; Stacy et al. 2012). There are indications, though,
that the Pop III mass could occasionally grow to > 300M⊙, in cases of unusu-
ally weak protostellar feedback (Hirano et al. 2014; Susa et al. 2014).

Are Pop III stars suitable GRB progenitors? To successfully trigger a col-
lapsar event, the leading contender for long-duration GRBs (Woosley 1993;
MacFadyen et al. 2001), a number of conditions have to be met: a central BH
has to form, a relativistic jet has to escape the stellar envelope before being
quenched, and there has to be a suﬃcient degree of angular momentum close
to the center, to delay the accretion of material onto the BH. These are quite
stringent, and often diﬃcult to fulﬁll simultaneously (Zhang & Fryer 2004;
Petrovic et al. 2005; Belczynski et al. 2007).

The ﬁrst requirement for a collapsar central GRB engine, the emergence
of BH remnants, is fulﬁlled because of the top-heavy nature of the primor-
dial IMF. The binary nature of Pop III stars may allow to meet the second
requirement of providing an escape channel for the jet, if the binary is suﬃ-
ciently close to allow for Roche-lobe overﬂow and a common-envelope phase,
to expel the extended hydrogen (and helium?) envelope. This may be crucial
to prevent the quenching of the relativistic jet, launched by the central engine
(Bromm & Loeb 2006) (but see Suwa & Ioka 2011, and the discussion on this
key point below). Simulations have begun to constrain the statistics of Pop III
binaries, within a fully cosmological context (Stacy & Bromm 2013). The re-
sulting distribution of semi-major axes is found to be quite broad, with a peak
around ∼ 300 AU. Those simulations, however, cannot yet resolve the forma-
tion and evolution of tight binaries, due to the resolution limit of ∼ 20 AU.
Such improved simulations would be required to probe the regime of contact
binaries, where Roche-lobe overﬂow or common-envelope evolution could oc-
cur during the later red supergiant phase. It appears likely, though, that such
tight binaries exist. A fraction of the sink particles that numerically repre-

sent Pop III stars in the simulations undergo mergers when they approach to
within the resolution limit. With better resolution, some of those sinks/stars
may well survive as tight binaries.

What about the additional requirement that the collapsar progenitor re-
tains enough angular momentum? This question ties in with the rate of ro-
tation of Pop III stars, where almost nothing is known yet. A ﬁrst attempt
to address this within a fully cosmological context has recently been carried
out (Stacy et al. 2011, 2013), indicating that the ﬁrst stars may have typically
been very fast rotators, with surface rotation speeds of a few 10 percent of
the break-up value. Such high rates of rotation would have important conse-
quences for Pop III stellar evolution, possibly enabling strong mixing currents,
and for the fate encountered at death (Yoon et al. 2006). Thus, it is plausible
that all requirements for a collapsar central engine were in place in the early
universe.

An important caveat here is that any eﬀect of possible magnetic braking
on the ﬁnal stellar rotation rate has been neglected so far. Recent studies
have argued that turbulent dynamo ampliﬁcation in the primordial protostel-
lar disks might rapidly build up dynamically signiﬁcant magnetic ﬁelds (e.g.,
Schober et al. 2012). It is currently not clear whether such small-scale, tangled
ﬁelds could be organized into larger scale arrangements. If they can, magnetic
torques may be responsible for establishing Pop III stellar rotation rates similar
to what is known for present-day O stars. Ongoing magneto-hydrodynamical
simulations should soon help to clarify this key point.

3 Evolution of Pop III stars and GRBs

Metallicity is one of the prime factors that determine the evolution of massive
stars. Many features of stellar evolution are therefore uniquely found with
massive Pop III stars, compared to the case of metal-rich counterparts.

Massive stars on the main sequence in the nearby universe are powered
by the CNO cycle. In the early universe, CNO elements are absent and core
hydrogen burning starts with the pp chain. Because energy production by
the pp-chain is too weak to maintain thermal equilibrium, a massive Pop
III star initially undergoes thermal contraction until the central temperature
becomes high enough for helium burning to produce carbon. The CNO cycle
then becomes active with thus-produced carbon, and the structure of the star is
adjusted accordingly until thermal equilibrium is reached. The main sequence
evolution begins only thereafter (e.g., Marigo et al. 2001; Ekstr¨om et al. 2008;
Yoon et al. 2012).

The evolution on the main sequence and in later stages is more critically
aﬀected by the lack of heavy elements. In metal-rich environments, massive
star evolution is characterized by strong mass loss by radiation-driven winds,
for which iron lines play a particularly important role (e.g., Puls et al. 2008).
For massive Pop III stars, the radiation force resulting from hydrogen and

6

helium lines is too weak to drive a wind, and the predicted mass loss rate is
extremely low (i.e.,

˙M ≤ 10−14 M⊙ yr−1; Krti˘cka & Kub´at (2006)).

This has two important consequences. First, massive Pop III stars would
not easily lose their initial angular momentum via mass loss. This implies that
the evolution of massive Pop III stars could be dominated by the eﬀects of
> 100 M⊙)
rotation (Sects. 3.1 and 3.2). Second, even very massive stars (M ∼
that are close to the Eddington limit would retain their hydrogen envelopes
until the end of the evolution, This can produce very massive red supergiant
stars (see Fig. 1), which are not found in the local universe. Metallicity eﬀects
also critically inﬂuence the condition for convection inside stars, which plays
an important role in the ﬁnal structure at the pre-collapse stage (Sect. 3.3). All
of these eﬀects are closely related to the properties of Pop III GRB progenitors,
as discussed below.

3.1 The role of rotation

3.1.1 Evolution of angular momentum

One of the key necessary conditions for GRB progenitors is rapid rotation.
To trigger relativistic jets, a large amount of angular momentum should be
retained in the innermost layers of GRB progenitors until the pre-collapse
stage. More speciﬁcally, the speciﬁc angular momentum in the core must be

3 M⊙(cid:17) cm2 s−1 within the collapsar scenario,
higher than j > 1.5 × 1016(cid:16) MBH
where MBH is the black hole mass (Woosley 1993), and j ≃ 4 × 1015 cm2 s−1
within the magnetar scenario (e.g., Wheeler et al. 2000).
Observations indicate that the amounts of angular momentum are suﬃcient
to meet these criteria for a large fraction of massive main-sequence stars in the
nearby universe (e.g., Mokiem et al. 2006; Wolﬀ 2006; Ram´ırez-Agudelo et al.
2013). Recent numerical studies also indicate that massive Pop III stars would
be rapid rotators (Stacy et al. 2011; Rosen et al. 2012). However, numerous
observations imply rapid transport of angular momentum inside stars (e.g.,
Suijs et al. 2008; Charpinet et al. 2009; Eggenberger et al. 2012; Marques et al.
2013), which must have signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnal angular momentum dis-
tribution in the stellar core (Hirschi et al. 2004; Heger et al. 2005). While the
main mechanism for angular momentum transport is still a matter of debate,
the following two mechanisms have been considered most important in stellar
evolution models.

– Eddington-Sweet circulations: Thermal equilibrium in rotating stars gen-
erally breaks down because the radiative ﬂux along the polar axis becomes
excessive compared to that along the equatorial one (the von Zeipel theo-
rem; e.g., Kippenhahn & Weigert 1990). To compensate this thermal im-
balance, large-scale meridional circulations are induced in rotating stars,
which are nowadays often called ‘Eddington-Sweet (ES) circulations’ (e.g.,
Maeder & Meynet 2012). These ES circulations are not only important

Yoon et al. (2012).

for the energy ﬂux, but also for the transport of angular momentum. The
timescale for ES circulations in a chemically homogeneous star is roughly
given by τES ≈ τKH(Ω/ΩK)−2, where τKH denotes the Kelvin-Helmholtz
timescale and Ω/ΩK the ratio of the angular velocity to the Keplerian
value. Although τES can be in principle shorter than the nuclear timescale

8

Kenji Toma et al.

(τnuc) of a star, ES circulations are severely slowed down once the chemi-
cal stratiﬁcation across the boundary between the core and the hydrogen
envelope is built up (Maeder & Meynet 1998). Therefore, it is believed
that ES circulations cannot eﬃciently brake down the stellar core for most
cases (Heger et al. 2000; Hirschi et al. 2004).

– Taylor-Spruit dynamo: According to Taylor (1973), toroidal ﬁelds in ra-
diative layers of stars are always unstable to create poloidal ﬁelds (see
also Spruit 1999). If diﬀerential rotation can wind up thus-created poloidal
ﬁelds to amplify toroidal ﬁelds, the dynamo loop can be closed (Spruit
2002). This so-called Taylor-Spruit (TS) dynamo may lead to magnetic
torques that can redistribute angular momentum inside stars much more
eﬃciently than ES circulations. Theoretical studies indeed show that solid-
body rotation can be maintained in main sequence stars with TS dy-
namo (Heger et al. 2005). This rapid angular momentum transfer by the
TS dynamo has been invoked to explain the relatively slow spin rates of
young neutron stars and isolated white dwarfs, as well as angular velocity
proﬁles in low-mass stars on various evolutionary stages that are inferred
from asteroseismological data (e.g. Eggenberger et al. 2005; Heger et al.
2005; Suijs et al. 2008; Cantiello et al. 2014). However, the validity of the
TS dynamo theory is still debated (e.g., Braithwaite 2006; Zahn et al. 2007;
Arlt & R¨udiger 2011; Cantiello et al. 2014).

Evidently, the transport mechanisms may not be limited to these ones.
Rotationally-induced hydrodynamic instabilities apart from ES circulations
include the shear instability and the baroclinic instability. The interplay be-
tween ES circulations and the shear instability would be particularly important
for the transport process (Maeder & Meynet 2012). Several authors also inves-
tigated the role of the magneto-rotational instability (Wheeler et al. 2015) and
internal gravity waves in massive stars (Fuller et al. 2014). More progress is
certainly needed to have a reliable prescription for angular momentum trans-
port.

3.1.2 Chemical mixing

Rotationally-induced hydrodynamic instabilities can transport not only an-
gular momentum but also chemical species. This may lead to chemical mix-
ing of hydrogen-burning products from the convective core into the radiative
envelope in a massive star on the main sequence. Enhanced abundances of
nitrogen and helium are indeed found at the surfaces of many massive stars,
which provide evidence for such mixing (e.g. Hunter et al. 2008, 2009). The
eﬃciency of chemical mixing due to rotation has been recently calibrated by
Brott et al. (2011) using the inferred nitrogen abundances at the surfaces of
B-type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. But the anomalously high/low
nitrogen abundances observed in some slowly/rapidly rotating stars have not
been well understood yet (Hunter et al. 2008, 2009; Brott et al. 2011; Aerts
2014).

3.1.3 Mass shedding

Rapidly rotating stars can reach the critical rotation during the course of
their evolution if they do not lose a suﬃcient amount of angular momentum via
strong mass loss. Note that the critical rotation speed (vcrit) can become lower

than the Keplerian limit (vK = pGM/R) if the stellar luminosity approaches

the Eddington limit, as the following:

vcrit = vK√1 − Γ ,

(1)

where Γ is the Eddington factor (Heger et al. 2000; see Maeder & Meynet
2000 for an alternative description for the critical rotation speed). Once the
star reaches the critical rotation, mechanical mass shedding would occur, even
when radiation-driven winds are very weak. This would be the dominant mode
(Marigo et al. 2003; Ekstr¨om et al.
of mass-loss from massive Pop III stars
> 100 M⊙), however,
2008; Yoon et al. 2012). For very massive stars (M ∼
pulsationally driven winds during the red supergiant phase might also play an
important role (Baraﬀe 2001; Moriya & Langer 2015).

3.2 Chemically homogeneous evolution and GRB progenitors

Typical timescales about ∼ 10 secs of long GRBs imply that their progeni-
< 10 R⊙; Woosley 2006). All of the supernovae
tors are generally compact (R ∼
associated with a long GRB turn out to be Type Ic, which provide further ev-
idence for compact progenitors that have lost their hydrogen envelopes (e.g.,
Woosley 2006; D’Elia et al. 2015). It is therefore widely believed that the ma-
jority of long GRB progenitors are naked helium stars like Wolf-Rayet (WR)
stars. Another necessary condition for long GRB progenitors is rapid rotation
as mentioned above.

Mass loss by radiation-driven winds is negligible for Pop III stars, and
mass shedding due to rotation is not signiﬁcant enough to remove the whole
hydrogen envelope (Marigo et al. 2003; Ekstr¨om et al. 2008; Yoon et al. 2012).
This may raise a question of whether massive single Pop III stars can produce
an ordinary long GRB.

Probably, the only possible solution for ordinary long GRBs from single
Pop III stars would involve the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE).
CHE may occur with a suﬃciently high rotation speed if the timescale for
chemical mixing due to ES circulations becomes shorter than the nuclear
timescale (Maeder 1987). In other words, CHE can be realized if rapid chem-
ical mixing between the hydrogen-burning convective core and the radiative
envelope occurs, before nuclear burning builds up a strong degree of chemical
stratiﬁcation across the boundary between them that would dramatically slow
down ES circulations. In this case, almost all the hydrogen in the envelope of a
star is mixed into the hydrogen-burning core to be fused into helium, which is

calculated model, which corresponds to core neon exhaustion. The TS dynamo was included
in the calculations, and the two diﬀerent initial rotational speeds were adopted: 20% and
60% Keplerian rotation speeds for the left and the right panels, respectively. In the latter
case, the star evolves chemically homogeneously. Adapted from Yoon et al. (2012).

in turn mixed back into the envelope. The whole star is thus gradually trans-
formed into a helium star by the end of the main sequence. This makes the
CHE stars evolve blueward as shown in Fig. 1.

In the case of normal evolution, the helium core during the post-main
sequence stage would be signiﬁcantly braked down by the slowly rotating hy-
drogen envelope that expands to a red-supergiant phase, which can serve as
a large angular momentum reservoir (Heger et al. 2005). By contrast, CHE
stars do not undergo the red-supergiant phase and can retain a large fraction
of the initial amount of angular momentum until the pre-collapse stage (Fig. 2;
Yoon & Langer. 2005; Woosley & Heger 2006). CHE can be more easily real-
ized at lower metallicity (Yoon et al. 2006), and therefore CHE is a promising
pathway to long GRBs for massive Pop III stars (Yoon et al. 2012).

As summarized in Fig. 3 (see also Yoon et al. 2012), CHE would produce
GRB progenitor candidates for the initial mass range of 13 - 84 M⊙ if the
initial rotation speed is higher than about 50% of the Keplerian value. Another
interesting prediction of CHE is that the initial mass range for pair-instability
supernovae (PISNe) would signiﬁcantly decrease to 84 — 190 M⊙, compared
to the non-rotating case (i.e., 140 - 300 M⊙; see also Chatzopoulos & Wheeler
2012). These PISNe from CHE stars would appear as Type Ic, instead of Type
IIP that is expected for non-rotating or slowly rotating PISN progenitors. For
the initial mass range of 56-84 M⊙ of GRB progenitors, a pulsational PISN
would occur shortly before the core collapses into a black hole, which may
produce a very bright optical event via an interaction between the pulsational
PISN ejecta and the GRB jet that follows.

to the expanding hydrogen envelope. At the pre-collapse stage, the inner core
would rotate relatively slowly and its speciﬁc angular momentum would not
exceed the critical limit for producing a GRB.

Interestingly, because Pop III stars do not lose much mass, the total angu-
lar momentum can be more or less conserved and the speciﬁc angular momen-
tum of the hydrogen envelope increases as a result of the angular momentum
transfer from the core (see the left panel of Fig 2). In this case, the core would
directly collapse into a BH, and the envelope material would form a Keplerian
disk around it. The consequent accretion rate depends on the free-fall time
of the envelope material: it would be ∼ 10−4 M⊙ yr−1 for a blue-supergiant
(BSG) progenitor, and ∼ 10−6 M⊙ yr−1 for a red-supergiant (RSG) progeni-
tor (Woosley & Heger 2012). Therefore, supergiant Pop III stars could produce
an ultra-long GRB having a timescale of 103 − 107 sec (cf. Gendre et al. 2013;

12

Kenji Toma et al.

Virgili 2013; Evans et al. 2014; Levan 2014; Piro et al. 2014), depending on
the ﬁnal structure (Suwa & Ioka 2011; Nakauchi et al. 2012; Woosley & Heger
2012; Yoon et al. 2015).

Note, however, that the hydrogen envelope of a RSG is very loosely bound.
Recently, Lovegrove & Woosley (2013) showed that most of the RSG envelope
may be ejected as a result of the rapid loss of gravitational mass due to neu-
trino emission from the core while a BH is formed. This makes it diﬃcult for a
RSG to produce a long GRB transient even if its envelope is rotating rapidly.
By contrast, the binding energy of a BSG envelope is fairly high and it would
remain gravitationally bound to the newly formed BH. Therefore, rapidly ro-
tating BSGs should be considered good progenitor candidates for ultra-long
GRBs with a timescale of about 103 − 104 sec (Woosley & Heger 2012).
The remaining question is whether massive Pop III BH progenitors end
their lives as a BSG or a RSG. Although the relatively low-opacity with zero-
metallicity helps a massive Pop III star remain compact, non-linear eﬀects
of stellar evolution make it very diﬃcult to make a robust prediction on the
ﬁnal structure. For example, lower opacity in the core of a Pop III star than
in a metal-rich counterpart leads to a smaller size of the convective core on
the main sequence for a given mass, which in turn results in a more compact
carbon-oxygen core at the end of core helium burning. As a consequence, the
helium-burning shell source becomes very hot, inducing a more violent con-
vection above it. This often leads to penetration of the convection zone of
the helium shell source into the hydrogen-burning shell, boosting the CNO
cycle (Heger & Woosley 2010; Limongi & Chieﬃ 2012; Yoon et al. 2012). The
huge amount of nuclear energy produced in this way can make the star be-
come a RSG shortly before core collapse. The onset of this CNO boosting
sensitively depends on the adopted overshooting parameter and the initial ro-
tation speed, but it is usually found for Pop III stars in the mass range of
about 10 - 30 M⊙ (C. Kye & S.-C. Yoon in prep). For more massive Pop
III stars, the RSG solution seems to be generally favored (Marigo et al. 2001,
2003; Ekstr¨om et al. 2008; Yoon et al. 2012), but for a limited mass range of
about 30 − 60 M⊙, the BSG solution could be obtained with moderate rota-
tion or weak overshooting (Limongi & Chieﬃ 2012; Yoon et al. 2012; C. Kye
& S.-C. Yoon in prep; see also Fig. 1).

3.4 Very massive Pop III stars and supercollapsars

For the mass range above the PISN limit and below the general relativistic
< 50000 M⊙ without rotation), Pop III
instability limit (e.g., 260 M⊙ ∼
> 100 M⊙ (e.g., Fryer et al.
stars would directly collapse to a BH with M ∼
2001). This would lead to a collapsar that may produce a long GRB having
> 1053 − 1054 erg) and a very long timescale (T ∼
a very high total energy (∼
104 − 106sec), depending on the ﬁnal structure of the progenitor star (the
so-called supercollapsar; Komissarov & Barkov 2010; M´esz´aros & Rees 2010).

< M ∼

Gamma-ray bursts and Population III stars

In terms of stellar evolution, the following issues should be considered to

probe the possibility of Pop III supercollapsars.

– Very massive stars are close to the Eddington limit, and can reach the
critical rotation at a relatively low rotation speed. Angular momentum loss
through mass shedding becomes signiﬁcant accordingly, which slows down
ES circulations. For this reason, CHE cannot be easily realized for very
> 200 M⊙ (Yoon et al. 2012). This means
massive Pop III stars with M ∼
that they would not be able to avoid developing the typical core-envelope
structure during the post-main sequence phase.

< M ∼

< 700 M⊙ (Yoon et al. 2015).

– The angular momentum transport from the core to the envelope can easily
remove the core angular momentum in this case, if there exists a strong cou-
pling between them via, for example, magnetic torques. The angular mo-
mentum condition for a collapsar cannot be fulﬁlled in this case (Yoon et al.
2012). By contrast, if ES circulations were the dominant mode of angular
momentum transfer, the core and/or the envelope would retain a suﬃcient
amount of angular momentum to produce a collapsar for a limited mass
range of about 300 M⊙ ∼
– The RSG solution is strongly favored for these very massive stars: it is
most likely that Pop III stars with M > 260 M⊙ end their lives as a
RSG (Marigo et al. 2003; Yoon et al. 2012, 2015). Therefore, even if the
core was rotating rapidly enough to produce a collapsar, the resultant
relativistic jet would not be able to penetrate the envelope. The ﬁnal out-
come would be a jet-driven Type IIP supernova, rather than a GRB. The
caveat here is that the mass loss rate from such a very massive RSG is not
well understood. RSG stars are usually unstable to radial pulsations, and
pulsation-driven winds might be signiﬁcant. Whether or not such winds
can completely remove the hydrogen envelope of a very massive Pop III
RSG star is a matter of debate (e.g., Baraﬀe 2001; Moriya & Langer 2015).
– For a supercollapsar, a neutrino-driven jet cannot be eﬃcient because
of the large radius of the last stable orbit around such a massive black
hole. Therefore, another important ingredient for a successful supercollap-
sar is strong large-scale magnetic ﬁelds in the progenitor star such that
a relativistic jet may be triggered via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mech-
anism (Komissarov & Barkov 2010; M´esz´aros & Rees 2010, see also Sec-
tion 4). Magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in massive stars at the pre-collapse
stage has been hardly investigated so far, and we still do not know if this
condition of strong large-scale magnetic ﬁelds can be fulﬁlled in very mas-
sive Pop III stars.

In short, a supercollapsar seems to be rather diﬃcult to produce from very
massive Pop III single stars, given that they would not follow CHE and that
they would become a RSG at the pre-collapse stage, rather than a BSG or a
naked He star. However, binary interactions might produce a BSG supercol-
lapsar progenitor more easily, as discussed in Sect. 3.5 below.

3.5 Binary interactions and GRB progenitors

Binary interactions would be an alternative way to produce naked helium stars
at zero metallicity. However, it is expected that they are slow rotators in gen-
eral and would not produce a GRB (Yoon et al. 2010): GRB production even
from binary stars would require an exotic evolutionary path. Several diﬀerent
scenarios for binary GRB progenitors have been suggested (see Brown et al.
2000; Izzard et al. 2004; Fryer & Heger 2005; van den Heuvel & Yoon 2007;
Podsiadlowski et al. 2010), but because of the complexity of the related physi-
cal processes like common envelope ejection, the details of these scenarios have
not been properly investigated with self-consistent binary evolution models for
most cases.

Here we summarize the possibly important aspects of binary stars for Pop

III GRBs, which should be carefully studied in the near future.

– Mass exchange in close binary systems can enhance the number fraction of
rapidly rotating stars (de Mink et al. 2013). As shown by Cantiello et al.
(2007), the Case B mass transfer (i.e., mass transfer during the helium
core contraction phase or the early stage of core helium burning) is likely
to enhance the possibility for CHE in mass accretors. The parameter space
for this solution should be systematically explored for Pop III binaries.

– In the literature, evolutionary channels including the Case C mass transfer
(i.e, mass transfer during the late stage of core helium burning or there-
after) has been often invoked to explain GRB progenitors (Brown et al.
2000; van den Heuvel & Yoon 2007; Podsiadlowski et al. 2010). In metal-
rich environments, strong mass loss tends to prohibit the Case C mass
transfer from massive stars with M > 30 M⊙ that are potential BH pro-
genitors, but it would occur more frequently for Pop III stars that do not
lose much mass. It is therefore possible that the Case C channel for long
GRBs would be more important for Pop III stars than in the nearby uni-
verse.

– Binary mergers (in particular Case B mergers) may produce a BSG pro-
genitor more easily, because a fairly small mass ratio of the helium core
to the hydrogen envelope can be achieved in the merger remnants (e.g.,
Justham et al. 2014). Although the helium core may not be necessarily
rapidly rotating in this case, the hydrogen envelope must have a very high
speciﬁc angular momentum until the pre-collapse stage because mass loss
from Pop III stars is weak. Therefore, Case B mergers at low-metallicity
would be a very promising pathway to ultra-long GRBs. It would be par-
> 300 M⊙)
ticularly interesting if very massive BSG GRB progenitors (M ∼
could be produced in this way (see Yoon et al. 2015, for a more detailed
discussion).

4 Observational signatures in Pop III GRBs

4.1 How to identify Pop III GRBs?

Recent studies on stellar formation in the early universe predict that Pop
III stars may be most prominent at z ∼ 20 − 30 (e.g. Abel et al. 2002;
Yoshida et al. 2008; Bromm & Yoshida 2011, and see Sections 1 and 2). Ob-
servations of GRBs may provide unique probes of the physical conditions of
the universe at such redshifts. Due to their high luminosities, GRB prompt
>
emissions and afterglows are expected to be observable at least out to z ∼
10 (e.g. Lamb & Reichart 2000; Ciardi & Loeb 2000; Bromm & Loeb 2002;
Yonetoku et al. 2004; Gou et al. 2004). This can serve as a tracer of the his-
tory of the cosmic star formation rate (Totani 1997; Porciani & Madau 2001;
Bromm & Loeb 2006; Kistler et al. 2009; de Souza et al. 2011) and provide
invaluable information on the physical conditions in the intergalactic medium
(Barkana & Loeb 2004; Ioka & M´esz´aros 2005; Inoue 2007). Currently, the
most distant GRB that has been spectroscopically conﬁrmed is GRB 090423
at z ≃ 8.2 (Tanvir et al. 2009; Salvaterra et al. 2009), and GRB 090429B has
a photometric redshift z ≃ 9.4 (Cucchiara et al. 2011). The detailed spectro-
scopic observation of GRB 050904 at z ≃ 6.3 has put a unique upper bound
on the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium at that redshift
and estimated the metallicity (Totani et al. 2006; Kawai et al. 2006). See also
a recent detailed analysis of GRB 130606A at z ≃ 5.9 and related debates
(Totani et al. 2015, and references therein). These observations indicate that
GRBs are very promising for exploring the high-redshift universe (for a recent
review, see Salvaterra 2015).

In the context of the study of Pop III stars, a crucial question is how can
we identify GRBs originating from Pop III stars (Pop III GRBs) among bursts
> 10 e.g. by observation of the Lyα cutoﬀ
whose redshifts are determined as z ∼
at the IR frequencies. An unambiguous way to pinpoint a Pop III progenitor
is to examine whether the afterglow spectrum from its surrounding medium
is devoid of iron-group elements1 through high-resolution IR and X-ray spec-
troscopy by ground-based facilities and/or future space experiments. However,
there may also be the case that the surrounding medium is embedded in a re-
gion where stellar explosions have already occurred slightly earlier, and the
absorption lines of the ﬁrst heavy elements produced by those explosions are
thus imprinted (Wang et al. 2012). A true Pop III origin of the GRB pro-
genitor could then be missed due to this masquerading eﬀect. It is therefore
important to explore alternative strategies to identify Pop III GRBs. In this
regard, another proposed way is to focus on the total energies and durations
of GRBs estimated by the X-ray and gamma-ray observations of prompt emis-
sions and/or afterglows (Komissarov & Barkov 2010; M´esz´aros & Rees 2010;
Toma et al. 2011; Suwa & Ioka 2011). Pop III stars could be very massive stars

1 It may be misleading to state “devoid of metals”. Pop III GRB progenitors via CHE, for
example, could have ejected CNO elements into the surrounding medium via mass shedding
during the late stages of their evolution.

> 300M⊙, and then GRBs originating from Pop III VMSs
(VMSs) with M ∼
(Pop III VMS GRBs) could have peculiarly large total energies and long dura-
tions.2 Their values could be orders of magnitude larger than those of ordinary
Pop I and Pop II GRBs, providing strong hints for Pop III progenitors.

The recent numerical studies of the evolutions of Pop III stars imply that
luminous GRBs are rather diﬃcult to occur from VMSs (Yoon et al. 2012,
2015), as discussed in Section 3. However, it may not be interpreted as a ro-
bust prediction yet, since theoretical modelings of formation and evolution of
Pop III stars are highly non-linear, complex problems, as also noted in Section
3. There are several factors to be investigated, such as the multi-dimensional
eﬀects related to magnetic ﬁeld and stellar rotation, the radiative feedback, the
mass accretion after the onset of core hydrogen burning, the binary interac-
tions, and so on. If only Pop III stars with M < 100M⊙ could produce GRBs,
it would not be simple to identify Pop III GRBs through the estimate of the
total energy and duration scales. Such bursts at the high redshifts may not
be detectable by the current satellites (Nakauchi et al. 2012), and then persis-
tent eﬀorts on observational and theoretical studies with new high-sensitivity
satellites would be needed to ﬁnd out possible statistical diﬀerences between
Pop III GRBs and ordinary GRBs. On the other hand, the history of GRB
study tells us that some breakthroughs happened by simple observations, such
as the serendipitous discovery of GRBs itself, the isotropic angular distribu-
tion of GRBs in the sky revealed by BATSE, the discovery of the afterglow by
Beppo-SAX, the conﬁrmation of the connection between GRBs and supernovae
by HETE-2, and several recent discoveries by Swift and Fermi (for reviews, see
e.g. Zhang & M´esz´aros 2004; Kumar & Zhang 2015). The connection between
GRBs and Pop III stars might also be discovered by a serendipitous observa-
tion of a source which looks peculiar. Here we consider a case in which Pop
III VMSs can produce GRBs as luminous as ordinary GRBs and discuss their
unique observational signatures. Searches of such peculiar GRBs will constrain
the theoretical models of the formation and evolution of Pop III stars.

4.2 Pop III VMS GRB model

Let us ﬁrst make a phenomenological interpretation of the total gamma-ray
energies and durations of ordinary long GRBs which are currently observed.
Focusing on the most energetic GRBs, which are mainly detected by Fermi
satellite, they have Eγ,iso ∼ 1054 − 1055 erg. The typical duration is T ∼
10 − 100 s (Ackermann et al. 2013). In the collapsar model, the total gamma-
ray energy can be written as

Eγ,iso =

2 Recently, GRBs from supermassive stars with M ∼ 105M⊙ which could make seed BHs

for supermassive BHs are also discussed (Matsumoto et al. 2015).

Gamma-ray bursts and Population III stars

17

where ǫγ is the gamma-ray radiation eﬃciency, η the conversion factor from
the accretion energy to the jet energy, Macc the total mass accreted by the
> 0.5
central black hole (BH), and θj the opening half angle of the jet. While ǫγ ∼
and θj ∼ 0.1 are supported by some observational indications (Ioka et al. 2006;
Zhang et al. 2007; Frail et al. 2001) (but see Beniamini et al. 2015), the values
of η and Macc are highly uncertain. (Furthermore, the conversion factor from
the accretion luminosity ˙Maccc2 to the jet luminosity may be time-dependent,
so that η in equation (2) should be interpreted as a rough temporally-averaged
value of the energy conversion factor.) In a scenario in which the progenitor
star has an initial mass ∼ 30 M⊙, ends its life as a Wolf-Rayet star of ∼ 15 M⊙
after losing a large fraction of mass by the stellar wind, and collapses making
a BH of ∼ 3 M⊙, being accompanied by a supernova explosion with an ejecta
mass of ∼ 10 M⊙ (Iwamoto et al. 1998; Mazzali et al. 2006), the total accreted
mass is Macc ∼ M⊙. If the stellar wind is so weak that the star does not lose
much of its mass, we have Macc ∼ 10 M⊙. Correspondingly, η can be estimated
to be ∼ 10−4 − 10−2 for Eγ,iso ∼ 1054 − 1055 erg.
The conversion factor η should be determined by the jet production mecha-
nism. For driving relativistic jets, the thermal energy injection by ν ¯ν annihila-
tion (Eichler et al. 1989) and/or the electromagnetic energy injection by mag-
netic braking of the accretion disk or the BH may be viable. In the former ther-
mal model, η is estimated to be ∼ 10−4 − 10−2 for ˙Macc ∼ (0.1− 1)× M⊙ s−1
and MBH = 3 M⊙ (Zalamea & Beloborodov 2011). However, it depends on
the condition of the BH accretion such as the strength of the disk wind (see
also Suwa 2013). In the latter magnetic model, BZ process, i.e. the mag-
netic braking of the BH or the energy extraction of the BH rotational en-
ergy (Blandford & Znajek 1977), can give rise to even η > 1 as demonstrated
by MHD numerical simulations (Tchekhovskoy et al. 2011). There have been
some observational indications supporting such a high value of η in relativistic
jets of active galactic nuclei (e.g. Fernandes et al. 2011; Ghisellini et al. 2014).
In this model also, η depends on the condition of the BH accretion as well as
on the behavior of the magnetic ﬁeld (e.g. Tchekhovskoy & Giannios 2015).
There are also some issues relating to the physics of the BZ process itself
(Komissarov 2009; Toma & Takahara 2014).

The total duration scale may be estimated as the disk lifetime. If the pro-
genitor star is rotating at half of the break-up speed, then the initial outer edge
of the disk is at Rd ≃ R/4, where R is the stellar radius. The disk lifetime is
given by its viscous accretion timescale ∼ R2
d/(αcsH), where α is the eﬀec-
tive viscous stress parameter of the α-disk model (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973),
cs the sound speed, and H the scale height of the disk. The balance equa-
tion between the thermal pressure gradient and the gravitational force gives
cs/H ∼ ΩK, where ΩK is the Keplerian angular velocity, so that we have in
the thick disk case (H ∼ Rd)

Kenji Toma et al.

We should note that the duration of the bright part of the prompt emission may
be shorter than this estimate since the conversion factor from the accretion
luminosity to the jet luminosity and the accretion luminosity itself are time-
dependent (Komissarov & Barkov 2010; Kumar et al. 2008; Tchekhovskoy & Giannios
2015).3

We apply the above scalings of the total gamma-ray energy and duration to
a VMS progenitor with M∗ ∼ 103 M⊙, although those scalings include many
uncertainties. If we substitute Macc ∼ 300 M⊙, MBH ∼ 300 M⊙, R ∼ 1012 cm,
and z ∼ 20 for equations (2) and (3), we obtain

Therefore, if we were to observe a burst at redshift z ∼
Eγ,iso and T , this would very likely be a Pop III VMS GRB (M´esz´aros & Rees
2010; Toma et al. 2011).

Eγ,iso ∼ 1057(cid:16) η

(4)

For such large BH masses, the density and temperature of the accretion
disk are too low for neutrino cooling to be important, and then the thermal
energy from the ν ¯ν annihilation is insuﬃcient to power strong jets (Fryer et al.
2001; Komissarov & Barkov 2010; Zalamea & Beloborodov 2011). The electro-
magnetic eﬀects such as BZ process may instead power the jets, which should
be dominated by Poynting ﬂux (see also Suwa et al. 2007).

Pop III VMS GRBs share the property of the extremely long durations with
Ultra-long GRBs, which were recently detected by Swift with low redshifts (e.g.
Gendre et al. 2013; Levan 2014). Ultra-long GRBs have durations as long as
T ∼ 104 s, although their total gamma-ray energies are Eγ,iso ∼ 1053 −
1054 erg, which are comparable to those of ordinary GRBs. Thus the property
of the extremely high Eγ,iso would still be a unique property of Pop III VMS
GRBs.

Given the propagation speed of the Poynting ﬂux dominated jet inside the
progenitor star, ∼ 0.2c, deduced from MHD simulations (Barkov & Komissarov
2008; Bromberg & Tchekhovskoy 2015), the intrinsic duration of Pop III VMS
GRBs T /(1 + z) ∼ 104 s is suﬃcient to break through the star (see also
M´esz´aros & Rees 2001). Suwa & Ioka (2011) performed a semi-analytic calcu-
lation of the jet propagation inside the star with R ∼ 1013 cm, which is an
order of magnitude larger than our assumption, and showed that the jets can
successfully break through the star (see also Nagakura et al. 2012). While the
jet is propagating inside the star, the energy of the jet is dissipated at the jet
head and makes a thermally dominated cocoon between the jet and the stel-
lar envelope (Begelman & Cioﬃ 1989; M´esz´aros & Rees 2001; Matzner 2003;
Bromberg et al. 2011; Bromberg & Tchekhovskoy 2015). The cocoon can also
be ejected after the jet breakout, and it can release thermal emission, which
provide information about the progenitor star (Kashiyama et al. 2013). In-
deed, the luminous supernova-like emission associated with Ultra-long GRB

3 Mizuta & Ioka (2013) propose an alternative scenario that the duration of the bright
part of the prompt emission is determined by an increase of θj on a timescale of the pressure
decay of the cocoon emerging from the progenitor star.

111209A can be explained by the cocoon thermal emission (Nakauchi et al.
2013) (but see Greiner et al. 2015).

4.3 Prompt emission

(2) and (3) by ∼ Eγ,iso/[T /(1 + z)] as

where the notation Qx = Q/10x in cgs units is adopted. This value is only one
order of magnitude larger than that of ordinary GRBs.

erg s−1, (5)

We require the spectral model to examine the detectability of the prompt
emission of Pop III VMS GRBs, although the prompt emission mechanism of
GRBs is still under debate. Particularly for the magnetically dominated jets,
it is very uncertain.

Even the magnetically dominated jets may have a subdominant thermal
component, which may be released at the photosphere of the jets. The spec-
trum of this thermal emission can be estimated in a standard ﬁreball model
(Toma et al. 2011). For the photospheric thermal luminosity as 3×1052 erg s−1
and 1 + z = 20, the spectral peak energy and the ﬂux are estimated as
Ep,obs ≃ 70 keV and F ≃ 7 × 10−9 erg cm−2 s−1. This emission is marginally
detectable by the BAT detector on Swift.
An alternative way to estimate the spectral peak energy of the prompt
emission is based on empirical laws claimed for observed ordinary GRBs
(Nakauchi et al. 2012). If the Poynting ﬂux of the jets are eﬃciently converted
to the radiation energy ﬂux, the observed ﬂux is F ∼ 7 × 10−8 erg cm−2 s−1
for Lγ,iso ∼ 3 × 1053 erg s−1 and 1 + z = 20. Then if the spectral prop-
erty obeys the empirical Ep − Lγ,iso relation (Yonetoku et al. 2010), we have
Ep,obs ∼ 80 keV, or if the spectral property obeys the empirical Ep − Eγ,iso
relation (Amati 2006), we have Ep,obs ∼ 4 MeV. In both cases the prompt
emission is detectable by currently operating satellites.
However, we have adopted η ∼ 10−2 for the above estimates, which cor-
respond to the high end of the estimate of η (see Section 4.2). For conser-
vative values η ∼ 10−4 − 10−3, the radiation luminosity is orders of magni-
tude smaller, so that their detections by the current satellites are diﬃcult.
Next-generation satellites will be needed in such cases (Suwa & Ioka 2011;
Nakauchi et al. 2012).

4.4 Afterglow

The external shock driven by the jet in the circumburst medium powers
the afterglow, which can be studied independently of the prompt emission
(M´esz´aros & Rees 1997; Sari et al. 1998). The external shock ampliﬁes the

7 GeV, as shown by the dashed line. The dotted line represents the prompt emission as a
subdominant photospheric thermal component. See Toma et al. (2011) for more details.

magnetic ﬁeld in the shocked region via plasma and/or magnetohydrody-
namic instabilities and accelerates the electrons in the shocked region to a
power-law energy distribution. The accelerated electrons produce synchrotron
and synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) radiation as an afterglow. This afterglow
model seems to be robust, since it can explain many of the late-time (i.e. since
several hours after the burst trigger) multi-band afterglows so far, and sim-
ple extension of this model (e.g. continuous energy injection into the external
shock) may explain many of the early-time afterglows (Liang et al. 2007).

Calculations of the external shock emission spectrum involve the param-
eters Eiso (i.e. the total jet energy minus Eγ,iso), the number density n of
the circumburst medium, the fractions ǫB and ǫe of the thermal energy in the
shocked region that are carried by the magnetic ﬁeld and the accelerated elec-
trons, respectively, and the index p of the energy spectrum of the accelerated
electrons. The latter three microphysical parameters have been constrained by
< 10−1, ǫe ∼ 10−1, and
model-ﬁtting the late-time afterglows as 10−5
p ∼ 2.3 (e.g. Panaitescu & Kumar 2002; Wijers & Galama 1999).

Figure 4 is an afterglow spectrum at the time t ∼ T from the burst trig-
ger (i.e. the early brightest phase of the afterglow) calculated for Pop III
VMS GRBs by Toma et al. (2011). The parameters are Eiso = 4 × 1057 erg,
T = 2.3 day, 1 + z = 20, n = 1 cm−3, ǫB = 10−2, ǫe = 10−1, and p = 2.3. We
found that the ﬂux at the IR frequency is suﬃcient to estimate the redshift.

Fig. 5 Radio light curves at frequencies, 100 GHz, 5 GHz, 1 GHz, 70 MHz, of a Pop III
VMS GRB at 1 + z = 20 with the same physical parameters as Figure 4. See Toma et al.
(2011) for more details.

(Macpherson et al. (2013) discuss the afterglow detectability with JWST and
SPICA more systematically for broad range of parameters.) The Swift XRT
and Fermi LAT can detect the X-ray and gamma-ray radiation of this after-
glow, which may constrain the total energy scale Eiso and the number density
n of the circumburst medium. The constraint on n would provide invaluable in-
formation about the environment and the radiation feedback of Pop III VMSs
at the phase prior to their explosions (Kitayama et al. 2004; Whalen et al.
2004; Wang et al. 2012). A caveat is that in order to perform X-ray observa-
tion, one of the wide-ﬁeld detectors, e.g. Swift BAT and Fermi LAT, has to
be triggered by the prompt emission or the afterglow itself.

Toma et al. (2011) also found that the afterglows in the radio band are so
bright that they might be detected by survey observations with current radio
telescopes. Figure 5 is the light curves at various radio frequencies of the af-
terglow with the same physical parameters as Figure 4. This shows that the
radio afterglows of Pop III VMS GRBs can be very bright with very long dura-
tions. These may be point sources with very long variability times in the radio
sky. Deep radio surveys might detect them or can constrain the rate of the
Pop III VMS GRBs (Toma et al. 2011; de Souza et al. 2011; Ghirlanda et al.
2013; Macpherson & Coward 2015). Furthermore, such bright radio sources
could be useful for 21 cm absorption line searches (Furlanetto & Loeb 2002;
Ioka & M´esz´aros 2005; Toma et al. 2011; Ciardi et al. 2015), although we should
note that the brightness of the afterglow highly depends on the uncertain pa-
rameters discussed in Section 4.2, similarly to the prompt emission.

The external shock can also accelerate protons to the non-thermal energy
distribution, which can produce high-energy neutrinos via pγ interaction. The

22

ﬂux of these neutrinos can be high in the 10−100 PeV energy range (Gao et al.
2011) (see also Berezinsky & Blasi 2012).

5 Outlook

What then are the prospects for probing the end of the cosmic dark ages with
GRBs, and what are key challenges ahead? For the time being, the Swift satel-
lite, with its on-board X-ray and optical telescopes for the rapid localization
of gamma-ray transients in the sky, will remain a good facility for catching
> 6 − 9. The next mission, SVOM, with similar
high-redshift GRBs with z ∼
capabilities as Swift, is now being prepared to follow it. Several other satellite
missions targeting higher-redshift GRBs, such as JANUS and Lobster, have
also been proposed. Increasing the statistics of high-redshift GRBs, and detect-
ing peculiar sources suggestive of VMS progenitors, will constrain theories of
the formation and evolution of Pop III stars, and their GRB production mech-
anism, as discussed in this article. Wide-ﬁeld, space-based gamma-ray/X-ray
detectors are required to keep operating not only for high-redshift observations
but also for upcoming gravitational wave astronomy, which requires electro-
magnetic counterparts for robust conﬁrmation. The deep surveys in the radio
wavelengths may also be helpful for Pop III GRB searches.

From the theory side, we cannot yet make any robust predictions for the
ﬁnal masses (i.e., the IMF), radii, rotation speeds, magnetic ﬁeld strengths
and its conﬁgurations, and the binarity of Pop III stars either at the time of
formation or at the ﬁnal evolution stage before the explosion. Similarly, dur-
ing the GRB explosion phase, the mechanisms of driving relativistic jets and
releasing high-energy emissions are still subject to considerable uncertainty.
However, numerical simulations have been steadily extending our understand-
ing of some of those ingredients, and they will keep playing a crucial role in
theoretical study.

It is clearly important to improve our understanding of the Pop III GRB
formation channel, in particular regarding the rotation state of the progenitor
stars, and the characteristics of tight binaries. The challenge here is two-fold.
We need simulations with even higher resolution, to push into the regime
of possible binary overﬂow phenomena (Roche-lobe and common envelope),
while maintaining the large-scale cosmological boundary conditions. The sec-
ond challenge is improved physics, in particular inclusion of magnetohydrody-
namic eﬀects. The latter may crucially impact both the fragmentation prop-
erties of the primordial gas, and the rotation rates of the resulting Pop III
stars.

The eﬀects of rotation, magnetic ﬁelds and binary interactions are also
critical in the evolution of Pop III GRB progenitor stars. Furthermore, the
rapid rotation and strong magnetic ﬁeld are key ingredients for producing
relativistic jets via the BZ process. Our understanding of these physical pro-
cesses in massive star evolutions has been greatly improved during the last
decade both observationally and theoretically, but uncertainties regarding the

Gamma-ray bursts and Population III stars

23

transport processes of angular momentum and chemical species inside stars
still remain large. In particular, we still lack direct observations of very metal
poor massive stars, which makes it diﬃcult to test stellar evolution theory of
massive Pop III stars. We hope to overcome this diﬃculty with systematic
studies on massive star populations in very metal poor environments like in I
Zwicky 18 (e.g. Sz´ecsi et al. 2015).

Another key uncertainty relates to theoretical predictions for the rate of
Pop III bursts. Even if we can narrow down the uncertainty in the Pop III
GRB formation eﬃciency, as outlined in the previous paragraph, we still have
to contend with the poorly constrained Pop III star formation rate density.
This rate is only known within 2 to 3 orders of magnitude, mostly because of
our incomplete understanding of the (radiative and SN) feedback eﬀects that
regulate the primordial star formation process. Again, improved cosmologi-
cal simulations with ever more realistic feedback implementations promise to
provide more robust determinations in the next few years. To give a rough ball-
park impression of current, state-of-the-art predictions for the Pop III GRB
∼ 6: a robust upper limit should be ∼ 10 yr−1 sr−1 (Salvaterra et al.
rate at z >
2011), and a more realistic limit may be 0.1 yr−1 sr−1 (Campisi et al. 2011).
Again, the hope is that progress in our understanding of both the Pop III GRB
progenitor physics and the global star formation rate density is achievable in
the near future.
