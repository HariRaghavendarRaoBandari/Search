We show that the removal of angular momentum is possible in the presence of large
scale magnetic stresses, arisen by ﬁelds much stronger than that required for magne-
torotational instability, in geometrically thick, advective, sub-Keplerian accretion ﬂows
around black holes in steady-state, in the complete absence of alpha-viscosity. The eﬃ-
ciency of such angular momentum transfer via Maxwell stress, with the ﬁeld well below
its equipartition value, could be equivalent to that of alpha-viscosity, arisen via Reynolds
stress, with α = 0.01 − 0.08. We ﬁnd in our simpler vertically averaged advective disk
model that stronger the magnetic ﬁeld and/or larger the vertical-gradient of azimuthal
component of magnetic ﬁeld, stronger the rate of angular momentum transfer is, which
in turn may lead to a faster rate of outﬂowing matter, which has important implications
to describe the hard spectral states of black hole sources. When the generic origin of
alpha-viscosity is still being explored, mechanism of eﬃcient angular momentum transfer
via magnetic stresses alone is very interesting.

1. Introduction

Blandford and Payne 1 showed angular momentum transfer via large magnetic
stresses, in the absence of alpha-viscosity, in the framework of self-similar Kep-
lerian disk ﬂows. Here, we show in a simpler 1.5-dimensional, vertically averaged
disk model that the Maxwell stresses due to strong magnetic ﬁelds are adequate
enough for angular momentum transfer even in advective accretion ﬂows, without
self-similar assumption, describing the hard spectral states of black hole sources.

The idea of exploring magnetic stress in order to explain astrophysical systems
is not really new. This was implemented, for example, in the solar wind which
was understood to have decreased Sun’s angular momentum through the eﬀect of
magnetic stresses (see, e.g., Ref. 2), in the proto-stellar gas clouds which might have
been contracted by magnetic eﬀects 3. Ozernoy and Usov 4 and Blandford 5 showed
that the energy is possible to extract continuously by electromagnetic torques and
twisted ﬁeld lines in accretion disks. By linear stability analysis of the accretion
disks, it was shown by Cao and Spruit 6 that angular momentum is possible to
remove by the magnetic torque exerted by a centrifugally driven wind. However, by
solving the local vertical structure of a geometrically thin accretion disk threaded by
a poloidal magnetic ﬁeld, Ogilvie and Livio 7 showed the shortcoming of launching

successful launching.

Here we demonstrate,

strong magnetic
ﬁeld, stronger than that needed for magnetorotational instability (MRI) 8, with
plasma−β > 1 yet, on to the vertically averaged advective accretion ﬂows in ver-
tical equilibrium in order to transport matter. Therefore, we consider the ﬂow
variables to depend on the radial coordinate only. Although, in reality, a non-zero
vertical magnetic ﬁeld should induce a vertical motion, in the platform of the present
assumption, any vertical motion will be featured as an outward motion. Indeed,
our aim here is to furnish removal of angular momentum from the ﬂow via magnetic
stresses, independent of its vertical or outward transport.

2. Basic model equations

We describe optically thin, magnetized, viscous, axisymmetric, advective, vertically
averaged, steady-state accretion ﬂow, in the pseudo-Newtonian framework with the
Mukhopadhyay 9 potential. Hence, the equation of continuity, vertically averaged
hydromagnetic equations for energy-momentum balance in diﬀerent directions are
given by (assuming that the dimensionless variables do not vary signiﬁcantly in
the vertical direction such that ∂/∂z ∼ si/h and, as a consequence, the vertical
component of velocity is zero),

from viscous and magnetic parts). All the variables are made dimensionless in
the spirit of dimensionless x and z. We further assume, for the present purpose,
the heat radiated out proportional to the released rate with the proportionality
constants (1 − fvis) and (1 − fm), respectively, for viscous and magnetic parts of
the radiations. Γ1, Γ3, which are functions of polytropic constant γ, indicate the
polytropic indices depending on the gas and radiation content in the ﬂow (see, e.g.,
Ref. 12, for exact expressions) and Bx, Bφ and Bz are the components of magnetic

3. Solutions and Results

˙M and,
We take into account two situations. (1) Flows with a relatively higher
hence, lower γ, modelled around stellar mass black holes: such ﬂows may or may
˙M and, hence, higher
not form Keplerian accretion disks. (2) Flows with a lower
γ, modelled around supermassive black holes: such ﬂows are necessarily hot gas
dominated advective (or advection dominated) accretion ﬂows.

We ﬁnd that the ﬂows with plasma-β > 1, but α = 0, exhibit adequate mat-
ter transport, as eﬃcient as the α-viscosity with α = 0.08, but without magnetic
stresses, would do. This is interesting as the origin of α (and the corresponding
instability and turbulence) is itself not well understood. The maximum required
large scale magnetic ﬁeld is ∼ 105G in a disk around 10M⊙ black holes and ∼ 10G
in a disk around 107M⊙ supermassive black holes, where M⊙ is solar mass. The
presence of such a ﬁeld, in particular for a stellar mass black hole disk when the bi-
nary companion supplying mass is a Sun-like star with the magnetic ﬁeld on average
1G, may be understood, if the ﬁeld is approximately frozen with the disk ﬂuids (or
the supplied ﬂuids from the companion star remain approximately frozen with the
magnetic ﬁeld) or disk ﬂuids exhibit very large Reynolds number. Indeed, all the
present computations are done at the limit of large Reynolds number, as really is the
case in accretion ﬂows, such that the term associated with the magnetic diﬀusivity
in the induction equation is neglected. The size of a disk around supermassive black
holes is proportionately larger compared to that around a stellar mass black hole.
Hence, from the equipartition theory, indeed the magnetic ﬁeld is expected to be
decreased here compared to that around stellar mass black holes. Figure 1 shows

a typical set of accretion solutions and conﬁrms that ﬂows around a stellar mass
black hole with α-viscosity but without large scale magnetic ﬁelds (viscous ﬂow)
show similar behavior to that with large scale magnetic ﬁelds without α-viscosity
(magnetic ﬂow). The ﬂows around a supermassive black hole show very similar
features, except with reduced ﬁeld strength. For other details, see Ref. 14.

Let us now explore in more details, how exactly various components of mag-
netic stress lead to angular momentum transfer in the ﬂows. Figure 2a shows that
the stress component BxBz around a Schwarzschild black hole increases almost
throughout as matter advances towards the black hole. This implies that the ﬂow is
prone to outﬂow through the ﬁeld lines, which eﬀectively helps in infalling matter
towards the black hole. However, in the near vicinity of black hole, BxBz decreases,
as indeed outﬂow is not possible therein. In this ﬂow zone, the angular momentum
becomes very small which practically does not aﬀect the infall. The magnitude of
BφBz decreases till the inner region of accretion ﬂow, implying the part of matter

to be spiralling out and, hence, removing angular momentum leading to infall of
matter. Finally, the magnitude of BxBφ increases at a large and a small distances
from the black hole (except around the transition radius), which helps removing
angular momentum and further infall. This is the same as the Shakura-Sunyaev
viscous stress would do with the increase of matter pressure. However, at the inter-
mediate zone, the angular momentum transfer through BxBφ reverses and a part
of the matter outﬂows. At the Keplerian to sub-Keplerian transition zone, due
to the increase of ﬂow thickness, matter is vertically kicked eﬀectively, showing a
decrease of BxBφ. Majority of the features remain similar for the ﬂow around a
rotating black hole, as shown in Fig. 2b. However, a rotating black hole reveals
a stronger/eﬃcient outﬂow/jet in general. Hence, except at the inner zone, BxBφ
decreases throughout, which helps kicking the matter outwards by transferring the
angular momentum inwards.

Components of magnetic stress: BxBφ (solid line), BxBz (dotted line), BφBz (dashed

Diﬀerent components of the magnetic stress tensor have diﬀerent roles: BxBφ
controls the infall in the disk plane, whereas BφBz renders the ﬂow to spiral out-
wards and, hence, outﬂow. Moreover, BxBz helps to kick the matter out vertically.
Larger the ﬁeld strength, larger is the power of magnetic stresses. Interestingly,
the magnitude of magnetic ﬁeld decreases, as the steady-state matter advances to-
wards the black hole. This is primarily because BφBz (and also BxBφ for a rotating
black hole) decreases inwards almost entirely in order to induce inﬂow via angular
momentum transfer through outﬂow. This further reveals a decreasing |Bφ| as the
output of self-consistent solutions of the coupled set of equations.

4. Discussion and Conclusions

Is there any observational support for the existence of such a magnetic ﬁeld, as
required for the magnetic accretion ﬂows discussed here? Interestingly, the polar-
ization measurements in the hard state of Cyg X-1 imply that it should have at least

10mG ﬁeld at the source of emission 15. In order to explain such high polarization,
a jet model was suggested by Zdziarski et al. 16, which requires a magnetic ﬁeld
∼ (5 − 10) × 105G at the base of jet and hence in the underlying accretion disk.

In the present computations, we have assumed the ﬂow to be vertically aver-
aged without allowing any vertical component of the ﬂow velocity. The most self-
consistent approach, in order to understand vertical transport of matter through
the magnetic eﬀects which in turn leads to the radial infall of rest of the matter,
is considering the ﬂow to be moving in the vertical direction from the disk plane
as well. Such an attempt, in the absence of magnetic and viscous eﬀects, was
made earlier by one of the present authors 17 in the model framework of coupled
disk-outﬂow systems. In such a framework, the authors further showed that the
outﬂow power of the correlated disk-outﬂow systems increases with the increasing
spin of black holes. Our future goal is now to combine that model with the model
of present work, so that the coupled disk-outﬂow systems can be investigated more
self-consistently and rigorously, when the magnetic ﬁeld plays indispensable role in
order to generate vertical ﬂux in the three-dimensional ﬂows.
