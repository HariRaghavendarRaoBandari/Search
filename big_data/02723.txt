Abstract

For some one-dimensional discrete-time autonomous population models, lo-
cal stability implies global stability of the positive equilibrismo point. One of
the known techniques is the enveloping method. In this paper we extend the
enveloping method to one single periodic population models. We show that,
under certain conditions, “individual enveloping” implies “periodic enveloping”
in one-dimensional periodic population models.

Introduction

One-dimensional models are an appropriate mathematical tool to model the behavior
of populations with non-overlapping generations. This subject has been intensely
investigated by diﬀerent researchers.

An autonomous population model is a diﬀerence equation of the form

xn = f (xn), n ∈ Z+
0 ,

where the map f is a continuous function from the nonnegative reals to the non-
negative reals and there is a unique positive number x∗, the equilibrium point, such
that

f (0) = 0,
f (x) > x for 0 < x < x∗,
f (x) = x for x = x∗,
f (x) < x for x > x∗.

Furthermore, the map f is bounded on [0, x∗]. Notice that these conditions correspond
to the usual assumptions in population dynamics.

After normalization, we can always assume that x∗ = 1.

In [8] we can ﬁnd a
complete study for the local properties of x∗. In general, it is much more complicated
to investigate the global stability of x∗. The following result found in [10, Corollary
2.4] and [19, Theorem 2.1, pp 47] gives a condition on global stability.
Theorem 1.1. Let x∗ be a ﬁxed point of a continuous map f on the compact interval
[a, b]. Then x∗ is globally asymptotically stable relative to the interval (a, b) if and
only if f 2(x) > x for x < x∗ and f 2(x) < x for x > x∗, for all x ∈ (a, b).

In other words, a continuous population model is globally stable if and only if it
has no cycles of minimal period 2. This result was noticed much earlier by Coppel in
1955 [1]:
Theorem 1.2. Let I = [a, b] ⊆ R and f : I → I be a continuous map. If f has
no points of prime period two, then every orbit under the map f converges to a ﬁxed
point.

Unfortunately, this global stability condition may be diﬃcult to test. Moreover, it
seems that there is no obvious connection between the local stability conditions and
the global stability conditions.

In a series of papers [2, 3, 4, 5] P. Call and his collaborators embarked in the
theory that “enveloping” implies global stability. A function h(x) envelops a function
f (x) if and only if

(i) h(x) > f (x) for all x ∈ (0, x∗ = 1);
(ii) h(x) < f (x) for x > x∗ = 1 such that h(x) > 0 and f (x) > 0.

2

Combining this deﬁnition with Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2, one has the following
result.

Theorem 1.3. ([5]) If f (x) is enveloped by g(x), and g(x) is globally stable, then
f (x) is globally stable.

Hence, the enveloping function plays a central rule in this theory. In [4] P. Cull

presented the following result concerning the enveloping function.

Theorem 1.4. Let h(x) be a monotone decreasing function which is positive on
(0, xh > 1) and so that h(h(x)) = x. Assume that f (x) is a continuous function
such that

h(x) > f (x) on (0, 1),
h(x) < f (x) on (1, xh),
f (x) > x on (0, 1),
f (x) < x on (1,∞)
f (x) > 0 whenever x > 1.

Then for all x > 0, limn→∞ f n(x) = 1.

The preceding theorem shows the importance of the enveloping function in global
stability. So, the challenge will be to ﬁnd the apropriar enveloping. Surprisingly
or not, the following M¨obius transformation may help in ﬁnding the appropriate
enveloping:

Theorem 1.5. [4] If f (x) is enveloped by a linear fractional function of the form
h(x) = 1−αx

α−(2α−1)x, α ∈ [0, 1), then f (x) is globally stable.

Since there are many options for enveloping in the preceding Theorem, it is nec-
essary to adjust each particular model with the enveloping in the set of parameters.
Hence, this task is not easy.

Eduardo Liz [18] tried to simplify this process. He studied enveloping function
for models of the form xn+1 = xn + f (xn) and uses Schwarzian derivative of f . He
was able to characterize when Local Stability implies Global Stability in certain one-
dimensional population models. His results are based in the following proposition:

Proposition 1.6. [18] Let f to be a population model deﬁned as before and suppose
that f is a C 3 map that has at most one critical point xc. If |f(cid:48)(x∗)| ≤ 1 and Sf (x) < 0
for all x (cid:54)= xc, then x∗ is a globally stable ﬁxed point of f , where Sf is the Schwarzian
derivative of f given by

Sf (x) =

f(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)(x)
f(cid:48)(x)

− 3
2

3

(cid:18) f(cid:48)(cid:48)(x)

(cid:19)2

f(cid:48)(x)

.

Later on, Rubi´o-Masseg´u and Ma˜nosa in [20] brings up the importance of the
enveloping function since the enveloping implies the existence of a Global Lyapunov
function. Thus the global asymptotically stability can be seen as a consequence of an
invariant principle.

Our main objective in this paper is to extend the theory of enveloping to one-

dimensional periodic population models.

In Section 2 we present some preliminaries concerning the theory of non-autonomous

periodic diﬀerence equations. In the next section we present our main results, i.e.,
we give the condition for which individual enveloping implies periodic enveloping for
mappings. The next section is devoted to applications. We illustrate our results in
several well known models in population dynamics as is the cases of the periodic
Ricker model, the periodic generalized Beverton-Holt model and the periodic logistic
model. A mixing population models are studied as well.

2 Periodic systems

A diﬀerence equation is called non-autonomous if it is governed by the rule

(2.1)
where x ∈ X and X is a topological space. Here the orbit of a point x0 is generated
by the composition of the sequence of maps

xn+1 = fn(xn), n ∈ Z+,

Explicitly,

f0, f1, f2, . . . .

x1 = f0(x0),
x2 = f1(x1) = f1 ◦ f0(x0),

...

xn+1 = fn ◦ fn−1 ◦ . . . ◦ f1 ◦ f0(x0),

...

If the sequence of maps is periodic, i.e., fn+p = fn, for all n = 0, 1, 2 . . . and
some positive integer p > 1, then we talk about non-autonomous periodic diﬀerence
equations. Systems where the sequence of maps is periodic, model population with
ﬂuctuation habitat, and they are commonly called periodically forced systems.

Throughout this paper we work with non-autonomous periodic diﬀerence equation

in which p is the minimal period of Equation (2.1) and X = R.

4

Notice that the non-autonomous periodic diﬀerence equation (2.1) does not gen-
erate a discrete (semi)dynamical system [14] as it may not satisfy the (semi)group
property. One of the most eﬀective ways of converting the non-autonomous diﬀerence
equation (2.1) into a genuine discrete (semi)dynamical system is the construction of
the associated skew-product system as described in a series of papers by Elaydi and
Sacker [11, 13, 14, 15]. It is noteworthy to mention that this idea was originally used
to study non-autonomous diﬀerential equations by Sacker and Sell [22].
Deﬁnition 2.1. An ordered set of points Cr = {x0, x1, . . . , xr−1} is an r−periodic
cycle in X if

f(i+nr) mod p(xi) = x(i+1) mod r, n ∈ Z+.

In particular,

and

fi(xi) = xi+1, 0 ≤ i ≤ r − 2,

ft(xt mod r) = x(t+1) mod r, r − 1 ≤ t ≤ p − 1.

It should be noted that the r−periodic cycle Cr in X generates an s−periodic

cycle on the skew-product X × Y (Y = {f0, f1, . . . , fp−1}) of the form

(cid:98)Cs = {(x0, f0), (x1, f1), ..., (x(s−1) mod r, f(s−1) mod p)},

To distinguish these two cycles, the r−periodic cycle Cr on X is called an r−geometric

where s = lcm[r, p] is the least common multiple of r and p.
cycle (or simply r−periodic cycle when there is no confusion), and the s−periodic

cycle (cid:98)Cs on X × Y is called an s−complete cycle. Notice that either r < p, or r = p

or r > p.

Deﬁne the composition operator Φ as follows

n = fn+i−1 ◦ . . . ◦ fi+1 ◦ fi.
Φi

When i = 0 we write Φ0

As a consequence of the above remarks it follows that the s−complete cycle (cid:98)Cs is

n as Φn.

a ﬁxed point of the composition operator Φi

s. In other words we have that

Φi

s(xi mod r) = xi mod r.

If the sequence of maps {fi}, i ≥ 0 is a parameter family of maps one-to-one in the
parameter, then by [9] we have that xi mod p is a ﬁxed point of Φp.

3 Enveloping in periodic models

In this section we extend the idea of enveloping to periodic single species population
models.

In population dynamics it is common to work with a parameter family of maps.
If we are working with a certain population model, we can always rescale the positive
ﬁxed point to x∗ = 1. Hence, under this scenario, a parameter family of maps will
have the same positive ﬁxed point. Having in mind this idea, we point out the ﬁrst
assumption of our work.
H1 - Let F = {f0, f1, f2, . . .} to be a set of C 1 population models such that fi(1) =

1, for all i = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Assume that the composition

Φp(x) = fp−1 ◦ . . . ◦ f1 ◦ f0(x)

is continuous in a subset of the nonnegative reals. Further, in order to guaranty
periodicity of the equation

xn+1 = fn(xn),

we also require that the maps on F are periodic with period p, i.e., fn+p = fn, for all
n.

A natural question arises in the ﬁeld of periodic diﬀerence equations: is the com-

position of population models a population model?

The answer of this question, in general, is negative, it depends on the individual

maps. In Figure 1 we present a concrete example, where

.

and

f1(x) =

Observe that the maps of F are increasing in certain interval. Hence, one can

show the following proposition:

Proposition 3.1. Under hypothesis H1 the composition map Φp(x) is increasing
in (0, cΦ), for certain positive value cΦ. Moreover, there exists xΦ < x∗
Φ such that
Φp(x) > fi(x), for all x ∈ (0, xΦ), i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , p − 1} with Φp(x∗
Φ) = x∗
Φ.

Figure 1: This example shows that the composition of population models may not be
a population model

Proof. It follows from our hypothesis that each individual map fi is increasing on
(0, ci), for some ci > 0 (eventually the map fi can be increasing in all the domain).
Since the composition of monotone mappings is a monotone map, it follows that
there exists cΦ > 0, the minimum of the critical values of Φp, such that Φp(x) is an
increasing function on (0, cΦ).
unstable ﬁxed point of all the maps, we have that f(cid:48)
Taking the derivative of the composition map we have

Since each one of the individual maps fi is increasing on (0, ci) and the origin is an

p(0) =

f(cid:48)
i(Φi(0)) >> f(cid:48)

i(0), i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}.

i=0

This implies that there exists a positive number xΦ < x∗

Φ such that

Φp(x) > fi(x),

for all x ∈ (0, xΦ),

i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}.

The next assumption will be in the enveloping function. First, let us observe
the following example where we show that “individual enveloping” do not implies
“periodic enveloping”.
Example 3.2. Let f0(x) = xe1.5(1−x) and f1(x) = xe1.2(1−x) and assume that fn+2 =
fn, for all n. It is clear that f0, f1 ∈ F and xn+1 = fn(xn) is a 2−periodic diﬀerence
equation.
Each one of the maps f0 and f1 is enveloped by the map g(x) = xe2(1−x). The map
g(x) is a globally asymptotically stable population model since it is enveloped by the
decreasing fractional function h(x) = 2− x (for more details see [5]). Moreover, from
Theorem 1.3 one can conclude that the individual maps fi(x), i = 0, 1 are globally
stable since they are envelop by g(x).
To study the dynamics of the 2−periodic diﬀerence equation we study the dynamics

of the map

Φ2(x) = f1 ◦ f0(x) = xe2.7−1.5x−1.2xe1.5(1−x).

Plotting the graph of Φ2(x) one can conclude that there exists a positive value a <
1 = x∗

Φ such that

Φ2(x) > xe2(1−x), for all x ∈ (0, a)

and

Φ2(x) < xe2(1−x), for all x ∈ (a, 1).

Consequently, Φ2(x) is not enveloped by g(x). However, the individual maps f0 and
f1 are enveloped by g(x). Hence, we can not conclude stability of Φ2(x) from the
individual enveloping g(x). In Section 4.1 we will show that Φ2(x) is also enveloped
by h(x) = 2 − x and consequently from Theorem 1.5 it is globally stable.

Our goal in this work is to ﬁnd certain class of maps where individual enveloping
implies periodic enveloping. Due the preceding examples we have to guarantee: (i)
the composition of population models is a population model and (ii) the individual
enveloping is also an enveloping for the composition map, i.e., we have to guarantee
that the composition map has two ﬁxed points, the origin and a positive ﬁxed point
Φ, Φp(x) > x if x ∈ (0, x∗
x∗
Φ, and there exits an enveloping
for a sequence of the individual maps fi that envelops the composition map. These
observations motivates the second assumption:
the set F and h ◦ h(x) = x.

H2 - There exits a decreasing envelop h such that h(x) envelops all the maps in

Φ) and Φ(x)p < x if x > x∗

The following proposition may help us in the construction of an envelop. We will

omit the prove since the result follows directly by symmetry.

8

Proposition 3.3. Let h to be an enveloping of a population model f in the conditions
of hypothesis H2. Consider the graph of f and the curve, Sf , obtained from the
graph of f by symmetry with respect to the diagonal y = x. Then, the graph of h lies
between the graph of f and the curve Sf everywhere, with the exception of the ﬁxed
point x∗ = 1.

We are now ready to present our main result of this section. It states the conditions

in which individual enveloping implies periodic enveloping.

Theorem 3.4. Under hypothesis H1 and H2, the composition map Φp(x) is a globally
asymptotically stable population model.

Proof. The prove follows by induction. We will show the result for the composition
of two maps (p = 2) and omit the general case (p > 2).

Combining H1 and H2 it follows from Theorem 1.4 that fi(x), i = 0, 1, 2, . . . is a

sequence of globally asymptotically stable population models.
Φp(1) = 1. The uniqueness of x∗

Since fi(0) = 0 and fi(1) = 1, for all i = 0, 1, 2, . . . it follows that Φp(0) = 0 and
Let us ﬁrst study the composition map Φ2(x) = f1 ◦ f0(x). Since Φ2(1) = 1 we

Φ = 1 will follow in the following arguments.

split the prove into two cases: I - 0 < x < 1 and II - x > 1.
when x ∈ (0, 1)).

Case I: If 0 < x < 1, either f0(x) > 1 or x < f0(x) < 1 (recall that f0(x) > x
If f0(x) > 1 then f1 ◦ f0(x) = f1 (f0(x)) < f0(x) < h(x). Since h is decreasing and

f1(y) > h(y), for all y > 1, we have that

x = h ◦ h(x) < h ◦ f0(x) < f1 ◦ f0(x).

If x < f0(x) < 1, then h ◦ f0(x) < h(x). But, since f0(x) < 1 we have f1 ◦ f0(x) <
h ◦ f0(x) < h(x). On the other hand x < f0(x) < f1 ◦ f0(x).
Case II: Let x > 1 and assume ﬁrst 0 < f0(x) < 1. This implies that f1 ◦ f0(x) >
f0(x) > h(x). In order to prove that f1 ◦ f0(x) < x we notice that

x = h ◦ h(x) > h ◦ f0(x) > f1 ◦ f0(x).

When x > f0(x) > 1, we have that h ◦ f0(x) > h(x) and consequently f1 ◦ f0(x) >
h ◦ f0(x) > h(x). Since f0(x) > 1 it follows that x > f0(x) > f1 ◦ f0(x).

We have shown that Φ2(x) is a population model and the enveloping function h
envelops the composition map Φ2. Consequently, from Theorem 1.4 the map Φ2(x)
is a globally asymptotically stable population model.

It will be beneﬁcial, in certain cases, to have the contrapositive of this theorem

which we write in the following corollary:

9

Corollary 3.5. If f0, f1, . . . , fp−1 are population models and the composition map Φp
is not a population model, then it can not exist an enveloping h, in the conditions of
hypotheses H2, such that h envelops all the individual population models.

4 Applications

In this section we illustrate our results in some one-dimensional periodic popula-
tion models. We study a family of Ricker maps, a family of Beverton-Holt models,
quadratic models, mixing models and harvesting models.

4.1 Ricker model

Let us consider the periodic diﬀerence equation given by the following equation

xn+1 = Rn(xn),

where the sequence of maps Rn(x) is given by

Rn(x) = xern(1−x), rn > 0, n = 0, 1, 2 . . . .

(4.1)
The local stability condition 0 < rn ≤ 2, n ∈ {0, 1, . . .} of each individual popu-
lation model Ri(x) implies global stability of Ri(x), since each one of the individual
maps Rn(x), n ∈ {0, 1, . . .} is enveloped by h(x) = 2 − x, which is a fractional de-
creasing function with α = 1/2 (See Theorem 1.5). In other words x∗ = 1 is a globally
asymptotically stable ﬁxed point of Rn(x), n ∈ {0, 1, . . .}. Notice that h ◦ h(x) = x.
Thus, hypothesis H2 is satisﬁed.

In order to have periodicity we require that Rn+p = Rn, for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . .,
i.e., the sequence of parameters satisﬁes rn = rn mod p for all n. It is clear that the
composition map

Φp(x) = Rp−1 ◦ . . . ◦ R1 ◦ R0(x)

is continuous in R+
0 . Consequently, hypothesis H1 is satisﬁed. Hence, from Theorem
3.4 it follows that Φp(x) is a globally asymptotically stable population model, i.e.,
the p−periodic Ricker diﬀerence equation is globally stable whenever rn ∈ (0, 2],
n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..

Hence, in this family of population models, individual enveloping implies periodic

enveloping.
In Figure 2 is represented a concrete example where r0 = 1.8, r1 = 1.2 and
r2 = 0.5. The composition map Φ3 = R2 ◦ R1 ◦ R0 is represented by the solid curve.
The dashed line is the enveloping function while the tiny curves are the individual
population models.

10

Figure 2: An illustration of the “individual enveloping” (tiny curves) and the “com-
position enveloping” (solid curve) in the one-parameter family of a Ricker type map.
In this case individual enveloping implies periodic enveloping and consequently the
global stability of the positive ﬁxed point in the periodic equation.

Before ending this example, we notice that (cid:81)p−1

i=0 |1 − ri| < 1 is the stability

condition for the ﬁxed point x∗ = 1 under the action of the composition map Φp.

Finally, we should mention that R. Sacker [21] used a diﬀerent method to show

global stability of a similar periodic Ricker type model given by

in the parameter region 0 < rn ≤ 2, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , p − 1.

xn+1 = xnern−xn

4.2 Generalized Beverton-Holt model

Let xn+1 = Bn(xn), n = 0, 1, 2, . . . where the map Bn is given by

Bn(x) =

µnx

1 + (µn − 1)xcn

.

(4.2)

Assume that µn > 1 and 0 < cn ≤ 2, for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
The individual population map Bn(x) has two ﬁxed point, the origin and a positive
ﬁxed point given by x∗ = 1. It is easily shown that the origin is an unstable ﬁxed

point since |B(cid:48)
of the positive ﬁxed point is given by µn(cn − 2) ≤ cn, for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . This
condition implies global stability since each individual map Bn(x), n = 0, 1, 2, . . . is
enveloped by

h(x) =

1
x

,

which is a decreasing fractional function with h ◦ h(x) = x. Hence, H2 is satisﬁed.
Let us assume now the periodicity of the map Bn by taking µn+q = µn and cn+r =
cn for some q, r = 1, 2, 3, . . .. This implies that Bn+p = Bn, where p = lcm(q, r).
From the fact that rn > 1, for all n, it follows that 1 + (rn − 1)xcn > 0 whenever
x ∈ R+. Hence, the composition of the Beverton-Holt models is well deﬁned and thus
we have the continuity of the composition. Consequently, H1 is satisﬁed. It follows
from Theorem 3.4 that

Φp(x) = Bp−1 ◦ . . . B1 ◦ B0(x)

is a globally asymptotically stable population model. Consequently, the p−periodic
Beverton-Holt equation xn+1 = Bn(xn), Bn+p = Bn, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . is globally stable
whenever µn > 1 and 0 < cn ≤ 2.

Notice that the condition of stability of the positive ﬁxed point of Φp is given by

p−1(cid:89)

|1 + (µi − 1)(1 − ci)| <

µi.

p−1(cid:89)

i=0

i=0

We should mention that when cn = 1, we have the classical Beverton-Holt model.
In a series of papers [6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23], the authors used a diﬀerent
method to study the global stability of the positive periodic cycle.

In order to have a complete study of this model, it remains to study the cases
where cn > 2 for all n, or a possible mixing case in the parameters cn, i.e, some of
the parameters are less or equal than 2 and others are greater than 2. Under these
scenarios, the individual enveloping is



h(x) =

if cn ≤ 2

1
x
cn − 1 − (cn − 2)x
cn − 2 − (cn − 3) x

.

if cn > 2

We point out that, in certain cases is possible to ﬁnd a common enveloping for all the
p individual maps and hence global stability of the periodic equation. However, this
is not the general case, as we show in the following concrete example.

12

Figure 3: An example showing that there is no Global Stability in the 2−periodic
Beverton-Holt model, when µ0 = 1.1, µ1 = 7, c0 = 7.5 and c1 = 2.3. In this case is not
possible to ﬁnd a decreasing enveloping that envelops simultaneously the individual
population models f0 and f1.

Let µ0 = 1.1, µ1 = 7, c0 = 7.5 and c1 = 2.3. Hence, the individual maps are given

by

f0(x) =

1.1x

1 + 0.1x0.5

and f1(x) =

7x

1 + 6x2.3 .

Both f0 and f1 are globally asymptotically stable population models with respect to
the positive ﬁxed point since they are enveloped by

h0(x) =

6.5 − 5.5x
5.5 − 4.5x

and h1(x) =

1.3 − 0.3x
0.3 + 0.7x

,

respectively (see Figure 3).

As is clearly shown in Figure 3 the composition map Φ2(x) = f1 ◦ f0(x) has 3
positive ﬁxed points and consequently can not be globally stable. Clearly, Φ2 is not
a population model. From Corollary 3.5 follows that it can not exist a decreasing
enveloping h, with h ◦ h(x) = x, such that h envelops simultaneously f0 and f1.

Notice that, if that enveloping exits, then from Proposition 3.3 it lies between the
graphs of f0 and f1 and the respective curves, Sf0 and Sf1, obtained from f0 and f1

13

by symmetry with respect to the diagonal y = x. As it is clearly shown in Figure 3,
there exits an interval ]a, b[⊂]1.5, 1.6[ where such enveloping fails.

4.3 Mixing models: Beverton-Holt acting with Ricker model

Let us now consider that the sequence of maps is given by

where 0 < rn ≤ 2, µn > 1 and 0 < cn ≤ 1 for all n. Assume the periodicity of the
parameters, i.e., rn+q = rn, µn+r = µn and cn+s = cn for some positive integer q, r
and s. Hence, the equation xn+1 = fn(xn) is p−periodic with p = lcm(q, r, s). Clearly
fn(x) ∈ F and consequently H1 is satisﬁed.
by the decreasing function h(x) = 2 − x. It is easy to see that

Now, from Subsection 4.1 the sequence of maps f2n(x), n = 0, 1, . . . is enveloped

f2n+1(x) =

µ2n+1x

1 + (µ2n+1 − 1)xc2n+1

µn > 1 and 0 < cn ≤ 1, n = 1, 3, 5, . . . is also enveloped by h(x) = 2 − x. To see this
observe that f2n+1(1) = h(1), h is decreasing and f2n+1(x) is increasing since

f(cid:48)
2n+1(x) =

µ2n+1 + µ2n+1(µ2n+1 − 1)(1 − c2n)xc2n+1

(1 + (µ2n+1 − 1)xc2n+1)2

This implies that H2 is satisﬁed. Consequently, from Theorem 3.4 follows that

Φp(x) = fp−1 ◦ . . . f1 ◦ f0(x)

Finally we determine the stability condition under composition operator, which is

4.4 Exponential and rational

Let us consider the non-autonomous diﬀerence equation

xn+1 =

(1 + anebn)xn
1 + anebnxn

,

where 0 < bn ≤ 2 and an > 0, for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. This equation can be deﬁned by
the following map

It is easy to check that the conditions of local stability at the ﬁxed point x∗ = 1

fn(x) =

(1 + anebn)x
1 + anebnx .

an(bn − 2)ebn ≤ 2

implies global stability since each map fn is enveloped by h(x) = 2 − x in R+
0 .
Let an+q = an and bn+r = bn, for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Then the sequence of maps is
p−periodic where p = lcm(q, r), i.e., the non-autonomous equation xn+1 = fn(xn) is
p−periodic. Clearly, the periodic composition map Φp(x) is continuous in R+
0 since
1 + anebnx (cid:54)= 0 for all x ≥ 0 and 0 < bn ≤ 2 and an > 0, for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..

Since H1 and H2 are satisﬁed, from Theorem 3.4 follows the global stability in

the non-autonomous periodic equation.

4.5 Quadratic model
Let xn+1 = Ln(xn), where Ln(x) = x(1 + µn(1 − x)), x ∈ In =
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The local stability condition for each individual population model
Ln(x), n ∈ {0, 1, . . . , p − 1} is given by 0 < µi ≤ 2. Since the fractional function
3−2x envelops each map Ln(x), n ∈ {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}, it follows that Ln(x) is
h(x) = 4−3x
a globally asymptotically stable population model whenever 0 < µi ≤ 2. Notice that
h ◦ h(x) = x. Hence H2 is satisﬁed.
Let us now assume the periodicity of the diﬀerence equation by taking Ln+p = Ln,
for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., i.e., the sequence of parameters are p−periodic. In order to
guarantee the continuity of the composition operator we construct the interval J as
follows. Let I to be an interval given by

The interval J is deﬁned by

Clearly J ⊇ [0, 1], Φp(1) = 1 and Φp(x) is continuous for all x ∈ J. Hence H1 is
satisﬁed. It follows from Theorem 3.4 that

Φp(x) = Lp−1 ◦ . . . ◦ L1 ◦ L0(x), x ∈ J

is a globally asymptotically stable population model whenever 0 < µn ≤ 2, n =
0, 1, 2, . . .. Consequently, x∗ = 1 is a globally stable ﬁxed point of the p−periodic
diﬀerence equation xn+1 = Ln(xn).

4.6 Beverton-Holt with harvesting

Let us consider the diﬀerence equation xn+1 = fn(xn), where the sequence of maps
fn is given by

fn(x) =

rnx

1 + (rn − 1)x

− cnx(x − 1), rn > 1, 0 < cn < 1, for all n.

In this model we are taking x in the interval

In =

cn −(cid:112)rn(rn(4 + cn) − 4)

.

Clearly fn(x) is a population model for all x ∈ In. Moreover, the extinction ﬁxed
n(0) = rn + cn > 1 for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The local stability

point is unstable since f(cid:48)
condition for x∗ = 1 is given by

0 < cn <

, for all n.

1 + rn

Since the fractional function h(x) =

envelops each individual map fn(x),
n = 0, 1, 2 . . . , it follows that fn(x) is a globally asymptotically stable population

model whenever x belongs to the interior of In and 0 < cn <
Notice that h ◦ h(x) = x.
Let us now assume the periodicity of the parameters by taking rn+q = rn, and
cn+r = cn for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Hence, the sequence of maps is p−periodic where
p = lcm(q, r). Deﬁne the interval J as follows

is a globally asymptotically stable population model whenever 0 < cn <
,
for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., i.e., x∗ = 1 is a globally stable ﬁxed point of the p−periodic

5 Final remarks

In this paper, we have established the conditions when individual enveloping implies
periodic enveloping in certain periodic population models. In other words, if a se-
quence of population models is enveloped by a common decreasing function h such
that h(h(x)) = x, then the periodic equation is globally stable with respect to the
positive equilibrium.

In population dynamics, this observation stats that, if each one of the individual
population is globally stable with respect to the positive equilibrium, then the pop-
ulation with ﬂuctuation habitat is also globally stable with respect to the positive
equilibrium. A several examples are given in order to illustrate the results.

Hence, in the case of certain periodic forced systems, local stability implies global

stability with respect to the positive ﬁxed point.
