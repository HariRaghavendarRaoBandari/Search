We present the massless six-point one-loop amplitudes in the open and closed superstring

using BRST cohomology arguments from the pure spinor formalism. The hexagon gauge

anomaly is traced back to a class of kinematic factors in pure spinor superspace which

were recently introduced as BRST pseudo-invariants. This complements previous work

where BRST invariance arguments were used to derive the non-anomalous part of the

amplitude. The associated worldsheet functions are non-singular and demonstrated to yield

total derivatives on moduli space upon gauge variation. These cohomology considerations

yield an eﬃcient organizing principle for closed-string amplitudes that match expectations

from S-duality in the low-energy limit.

1. Introduction

Over the past decade, several superstring [1,2,3,4,5] and ﬁeld-theory scattering amplitudes

[6,7,8] have been computed in manifestly supersymmetric form using the pure spinor for-

malism [9]. Computations in the minimal pure spinor formalism relied extensively on the

BRST invariance of the amplitude prescription as a way to organize the intermediate

steps and to simplify the answers. At tree level, this method led to a general solution in

closed form for the n-point integrand for both the open superstring [3] as well as its ﬁeld-

theory limit [6]. At higher loops — apart from the four-point one- and two-loop amplitudes

of [1,10,2] — the superstring computations of [4,5] so far were restricted to the low-energy

limit of the integrand. This limit only receives contributions from a subset of the zero-

modes of the pure spinor b-ghost and leads to a simpler analysis of OPE singularities

among external vertex operators.

In 2012 [11], the one-loop open superstring n-point integrand restricted to the above

zero-mode contributions of the b-ghost was computed in closed form in terms of scalar
BRST invariants denoted by Ci|A,B,C. These BRST invariants were later given a recursive
construction in terms of ten-dimensional SYM superﬁelds including a general expansion in

terms of ﬁeld-theory tree amplitudes [12]. Although the permutation-invariant integrands

in [11] yield the desired low-energy behavior, they fail to reproduce the hexagon gauge

anomaly on the boundary of moduli space.

The long-term goal of this project is to lift the restriction of b-ghost zero-modes from

the one-loop analysis of [11] in order to obtain the complete and supersymmetric n-point

one-loop amplitudes of the open superstring. In this paper we take the ﬁrst step and write

the complete six-point one-loop integrand for open and closed superstrings in pure spinor

superspace. These results reproduce the pure spinor analysis of the gauge anomaly in [13]

and match previous computations done with the RNS formalism. But unlike the RNS

answer which is restricted to gluon amplitudes (see [14] for the parity-even and [15,16]

for the parity-odd part), the result of this paper is fully supersymmetric and naturally

uniﬁes the contributions from both the even and the odd spin structures. Moreover, the

worldsheet integrals for both open and closed strings are cast into a basis. For closed

strings, a new factorized representation of the ﬁve-point kinematics paves the way for an

eﬃcient organization of the six-point result.

Since the gauge anomaly probes non-standard contributions from the b-ghost beyond

the zero-mode analysis of [11], the six-point one-loop result of this paper harbors important

insights about a diﬃcult corner of the pure spinor formalism which currently inhibits

further progress in multiloop computations.

2. Review: the hexagon anomaly and its cancellation

2.1. The pure spinor description of the anomalous gauge variation

The gauge variation of the six-point open-superstring amplitude at one loop using the pure

spinor formalism was computed in [13]. This subsection brieﬂy reviews that derivation.

The non-minimal pure spinor prescription to compute a one-loop amplitude in the

type-I superstring with a SO(N ) gauge group is given by [17]

An =Xtop

GtopZ ∞

0

dtZ∆top

dz2 dz3 . . . dzn hN (b, µ)V1

nYj=2

Uj(zj)i .

(2.1)

The sum is over the three worldsheet topologies at one-loop with Gtop and ∆top de-
noting their corresponding Chan–Paton factors and integration domains for zj . Denot-
ing the generators of SO(N ) in the fundamental representation by tai , the Chan–Paton

factors for the cylinder with all particles attached to one boundary and the M¨obius
strip are given by GP = N tr(ta1 ta2 ta3 ta4 ta5 ta6 ) and GN = −tr(ta1ta2 ta3 ta4 ta5 ta6 ).
When particles are attached to both boundaries of the cylinder one has, for example,
GNP = tr(ta1 ta2 )tr(ta3 ta4 ta5 ta6 ). The integration domains will be elaborated in section 3.3.
Furthermore, t is the one-loop Teichm¨uller parameter and µ the Beltrami diﬀerential,

b is the b-ghost (see [17] for the expression in the non-minimal formalism and [1,18] for its

schematic form in the minimal formalism), and (b, µ) ≡R d2w b(w)µ. The massless vertices

are [9]

V = λαAα,

U = ∂θαAα + ΠmAm + dαW α +

N mnFmn

(2.2)

with pure spinor λα subject to (λγmλ) = 0, linearized superﬁelds [Aα, Am, W α, Fmn] of
ten-dimensional SYM [19] and worldsheet ﬁelds [∂θα, Πm, dα, N mn] of conformal weight
h = 1 whose OPEs can be found in [9]. Finally, N regulates the integration over the

non-compact space of pure spinors [17].

As in the original derivation of [20], the gauge variation of the amplitude can be

computed directly by replacing the vertex operators by their gauge variation

δV1 = QΩ1 ,

δU2 = ∂Ω2 ,

where Ωj are scalar superﬁelds, and the BRST charge is deﬁned by

Q ≡ λαDα , Dα ≡

(2.4)

Since the total derivatives ∂Ω2 ≡ ∂Ω2
∂z2
by the boundary contribution zi → zj of the integrand, the gauge variation of the six-point

from the integrated vertex operators are suppressed

amplitude becomes

To arrive at the second line the BRST charge was integrated by parts. The only non-

vanishing contribution comes from {Q, b} = T and gives rise to a factor of (T, µ) which in
turn leads to a total derivative ∂

∂t on moduli space [21].

The correlator in the second line of (2.5) can be easily evaluated by consider-

ing the saturation of fermionic zero-modes of the fermionic ﬁeld dα. It is well known

[17] that at one loop the regulator N provides eleven zero-modes of dα, so the ver-

tices contribute the remaining ﬁve in order for the variation (2.5) to be non-vanishing,

(dW2)(dW3)(dW4)(dW5)(dW6). Integrating the pure spinor zero-modes has the eﬀect of
replacing dα1 dα2dα3 dα4 dα5 → (λγm)α1(λγn)α2 (λγp)α3(γmnp)α4α5 [22], and (2.5) becomes

with the following kinematic factor for the hexagon gauge anomaly [13]

K ≡ hΩ1(λγmW2)(λγnW3)(λγpW4)(W5γmnpW6)i .

(2.7)

The standard correlator of plane waves eikj ·x(zj ,zj ) is detailed in section 2.5. The component

expansion of (2.7) can be computed using the zero-mode integration prescription [9]

h(λγmθ)(λγnθ)(λγpθ)(θγmnpθ)i = 2880

(2.8)

and, when restricted to gluonic ﬁelds, is proportional to ǫm1n1...m5n5 km1

the next sections the result (2.6) will be re-derived from the gauge variation of an explicit

expression for the six-point amplitude at one loop.

2.2. Multiparticle kinematic building blocks

The zero-mode structure of the six-point one-loop amplitude in the pure spinor formalism

(2.1) allows for two OPEs among massless vertex operators. Such OPEs can be recursively
addressed using non-local multiparticle superﬁelds KP ∈ {AP
P } of ten
dimensional SYM [12]. They are referred to as Berends–Giele currents and deﬁned by

P , F mn

P , W α

α , Am

KP ≡

K[X,Y ] ,

(2.9)

sP XXY =P

where the multiparticle label P = 12 . . . p encompasses p external legs. The sum in (2.9)
instructs to deconcatenate P into non-empty words X = 12 . . . j and Y = j + 1 . . . p with
j = 1, 2, . . . , p−1. The shorthand K[X,Y ] is used to represent all the four types of superﬁelds
simultaneously. More explicitly [23],

Furthermore, we deﬁne the multiparticle version of the vertex operator V in (2.2) as

MP ≡ λαAP

(2.15)

such that Mi = Vi. The zero-mode saturation in the pure spinor one-loop amplitude
prescription selects certain superﬁelds from the integrated vertex operators U in (2.2), such
as V1(λγmW2)(λγnW3)F mn
their Berends–Giele currents such as W α

in the four-point amplitude [1]. Promoting the superﬁelds to

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

which automatically capture the results of iterated OPEs. In (2.17) and later places, the
notation (a1, . . ., ap | a1, . . ., an) instructs to sum over all possible ways to choose p elements

a1, a2, . . . , ap out of the set {a1, . . ., an}, for a total of (cid:0)n

p(cid:1) terms.

2.3. BRST invariants

The zero-mode bracket in (2.8) which picks up the unique scalar of order λ3θ5 from the

enclosed superﬁelds converts BRST invariants S(λ, θ) into supersymmetric and gauge-

invariant components hS(λ, θ)i [9]. Moreover, BRST-exact superﬁelds are annihilated,

hQ(E(λ, θ))i = 0 [9]. These properties already motivate to study the BRST cohomology to

foresee kinematic factors in ﬁeld-theory and string amplitudes in pure spinor superspace.

From the covariant BRST transformations of one-loop building blocks in (2.16) to (2.18)

one can recursively construct BRST-invariant scalars [12] such as

C1|23,4,5 ≡ M1M23,4,5 + M12M3,4,5 − M13M2,4,5 ,

C1|234,5,6 ≡ M1M234,5,6 + M12M34,5,6 + M123M4,5,6 − M124M3,5,6

− M14M23,5,6 − M142M3,5,6 + M143M2,5,6 ,

(2.21)

C1|23,45,6 ≡ M1M23,45,6 + M12M45,3,6 − M13M45,2,6 + M14M23,5,6 − M15M23,4,6

+(cid:2)M124M3,5,6 − M134M2,5,6 + M142M3,5,6 − M143M2,5,6 − (4 ↔ 5)(cid:3) ,

and vectors [12] such as

2 M132M4,5,6 + (2 ↔ 4, 5, 6)(cid:3)
4 M143M2,5,6 + (4 ↔ 5, 6)(cid:3) .

(2.22)

Their gauge-invariant bosonic components hC1|A,B,Ci and hCm
1|A,B,C,Di determined from
the zero-mode prescription (2.8) can be downloaded from [24]. As detailed in section 3.1,

the scalars in (2.21) enter one-loop open-string amplitudes [11] but fail to explain the
hexagon anomaly in view of their BRST invariance QC1|A,B,C = 0. The vectors Cm
1|A,B,C,D
in turn are essential to eﬃciently represent the interactions between left- and right-movers

in closed-string amplitudes, see section 4.

6

2.4. BRST pseudo-invariants

The hexagon gauge anomaly can be equivalently seen from a breakdown of BRST invari-

ance, see appendix C for further details. Hence, the superﬁelds in the anomaly kinematic

factor (2.7)

YA,B,C,D,E ≡

1
2

(λγmWA)(λγnWB)(λγpWC)(WDγmnpWE)

(2.23)

are required to appear in the BRST variation of the six-point open-string amplitude. We

will refer to gauge and BRST anomalies interchangeably in the rest of the paper.

The tensorial building block (2.19) selected by zero-mode arguments exhibits an

anomalous BRST transformation of this type in its trace component [25],

The same anomaly building block YA,B,C,D,E appears in the context of a scalar anomaly
current whose single-particle version reads [25]

J2|3,4,5,6 ≡

(2.25)

While the above deﬁnition suﬃces for the six-point amplitude, a general deﬁnition with

multiparticle labels can be found in [25].

Instead of a BRST-invariant completion such as the scalars and vectors in (2.21) and

(2.22), the recursions of [25] select the combinations

for the tensor (2.19) and the anomaly current in (2.25). Since their BRST variations are

exclusively furnished by the anomaly superﬁelds in (2.23),

QCmn

QP1|2|3,4,5,6 = −V1Y2,3,4,5,6 ,

(2.28)

these superﬁelds are referred to as BRST pseudo-invariants. The motivation for this ter-

minology stems from the purely parity-odd bosonic components which appear in the cor-

responding gauge variations such as (2.7) [25]. This ties in with the linearized gauge trans-
formations e1 → k1 of the expressions for hP1|2|3,4,5,6i and hCmn
1|2,3,4,5,6i on the webpage [24].

∂z . Exponentials of (2.29) give rise to the
Koba–Nielsen factor from the plane-wave correlator seen for instance in (2.6):

2.5. Worldsheet functions

String amplitudes augment kinematic factors with worldsheet integrals where the former

conspire to BRST invariants or pseudo-invariants once the integrals are reduced to a basis.
At one loop, the worldsheet integrand comprises doubly-periodic functions of the insertion

points of the vertex operators such as the bosonic Green function on a genus-one surface
with modular parameter τ ,

(2.30)

see (2.14) for the conventions for Mandelstam invariants sij. As a main result of this
paper, we give a representation for the six-point open-string integrand such that its BRST

variation builds up the modular derivative of (2.30) required by the anomalous gauge
variation (2.5). For this purpose, we recall a set of doubly-periodic functions f (n)(zij|τ ) ≡
f (n)

for one-loop superstring amplitudes. In particular, it turns out that

3. The complete six-point amplitude of the open string

In applying the pure spinor one-loop prescription (2.1), the non-zero modes of the b-ghost

lead to cumbersome CFT calculations. One way to address this diﬃculty is to use the

BRST invariance of the pure spinor formalism as a guiding principle to write down the

answers directly. This will be done in this section for the open-string six-point amplitude;
the result contains two classes of kinematic factors: BRST invariants (KC) and pseudo-
invariants (KP ). Recalling the zero-mode prescription h. . .i in (2.8), our conventions are

(3.1)

A separate analysis will be performed for each sector, and the pseudo-invariants KP will

shortly be deﬁned such as to make contact with the kinematic factor (2.7) of the anomalous

gauge variation.

3.1. The non-anomalous part of the worldsheet correlator

A gauge-invariant subsector of one-loop open-string amplitudes which describes the low-

energy behavior has been analyzed to all multiplicities in [11]. Its kinematic factors are

captured by the BRST-closed scalars Ci|A,B,C in pure spinor superspace as exempliﬁed
in (2.21). Their derivation considers only the zero-mode contributions from the b-ghost

leading to the scalar building blocks (2.16) and follows from integration by parts identities

of the worldsheet functions associated to OPE singularities to reduce the integrals to a

basis. More speciﬁcally, products of worldsheet propagators (2.29) and sij in (2.14),

Xij ≡ sijf (1)

ij = sij∂Gij ,

(3.2)

can be conveniently manipulated by discarding1 total derivatives acting on the Koba–

Nielsen factor (2.30):

∂pI(sij) = α′I(sij)Xq6=p

Xpq .

(3.3)

1 Boundary terms in zi do not contribute since the exponential of α′sij Gij vanishes as z

α′sij
ij

for zi → zj. This is obvious if sij has a positive real part, whereas the vanishing for generic

momenta follows from analytic continuation [28].

9

A basis of worldsheet functions in open- and closed-string correlators can be attained by

removing any explicit appearance of the ﬁxed insertion point z1 along with X1j through
the addition of total derivatives (3.3) with respect to zj.

In terms of the worldsheet functions (3.2) and the BRST invariants Ci|A,B,C, a

permutation-invariant kinematic factor for the six-point amplitude (3.1) is given by [11]

KC

6 =(cid:2)X23(X24 + X34)C1|234,5,6 + X24(X23 + X43)C1|243,5,6 + (2, 3, 4|2, 3, 4, 5, 6)(cid:3)
+(cid:2)X23X45C1|23,45,6 + X24X35C1|24,35,6 + X25X34C1|25,34,6 + (6 ↔ 5, 4, 3, 2)(cid:3) .

(3.4)

As initially observed in [11], the scalar BRST invariants Ci|A,B,C can be re-expressed in
terms of color-ordered SYM tree amplitudes. At six points, the identities [12]

hC1|234,5,6i = s56(cid:2)s45AYM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) − s35AYM(1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6)
− s35AYM(1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 6) + s25AYM(1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6)(cid:3)

hC1|23,45,6i = s46s36AYM(1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 5) − s56s36AYM(1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4)
− s46s26AYM(1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5) + s56s26AYM(1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 4) ,

(3.5)

(3.6)

allow to straightforwardly express all the polarization dependence of (3.4) in terms of
AYM(. . .). However, the above BRST-invariant integrand KC

6 cannot be the complete an-
swer for the six-point open string amplitude since it would imply manifest gauge invari-
ance2. In the following, we will show how the anomalous part of the amplitude can be

described using the BRST pseudo-invariants derived in [25] and reviewed in section 2.4.

3.2. The anomalous part of the worldsheet correlator

In order to correctly describe the anomalous part of one-loop amplitudes, the kinematic
factor KP

6 in (3.1) cannot be BRST invariant. According to (2.5), its BRST variation must
add up to a total derivative in moduli space and reﬂect a parity-odd gauge variation. For

this purpose, the notion of a pseudo BRST cohomology was introduced in [25] along with

recursive method to construct pseudo-invariants of arbitrary multiplicity and tensor rank.

Its scalar six-point representative P1|2|3,4,5,6 has been deﬁned in (2.27), and its BRST vari-
ation −V1Y2,3,4,5,6 in terms of the superﬁelds (2.23) tie in with anomaly kinematic factor
(2.7). That is why this superﬁeld is suitable to describe the anomalous gauge variation of

the six-point integrand.

2 We are grateful to Michael Green for insisting on a clariﬁcation of this point.

10

Using the above pseudo-invariants, the anomalous part of the six-point correlator (3.1)

will be argued to be

KP

6 =(cid:2)s12f (2)

12 P1|2|3,4,5,6 + (2 ↔ 3, 4, 5, 6)(cid:3) +(cid:2)s23f (2)

P1|(23)|4,5,6 ≡ P2|3|1,4,5,6 − P2|1|3,4,5,6 + P1|2|3,4,5,6 .

will be identiﬁed as a boundary term in moduli space in section 3.3. Therefore the anomaly

cancellation for gauge group SO(32) can be proven as in the RNS formalism and will not

be repeated here [20,29,15,16].

In contrast to the BRST-invariant kinematic factors Ci|A,B,C in (3.5) and (3.6), the
pseudo-invariant P1|2|3,4,5,6 cannot be expressed in terms of SYM tree-level subamplitudes.
Two classes of tensor structures in its bosonic components [24] pose an obstruction:

1. terms of the schematic form (ei · kj)6 where all the six gluon polarization vectors ei

with i = 1, 2, . . . , 6 are contracted with an external momentum

2. parity-odd terms involving the ten-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor ǫm1m2...m10

It is easy to see from Feynman rules and worldsheet supersymmetry that parity-even
contractions (ei ·kj)6 are absent in tree amplitudes of both SYM and the open superstring3.

3.2.1. Motivating the BRST pseudo-invariant worldsheet correlator

The pseudo-invariants P1|2|3,4,5,6 in (2.27) are symmetric under permutations of 3, 4, 5, 6
whereas the “reference leg” 1 is ﬁxed by the choice of unintegrated vertex V1 in the ampli-
tude prescription (2.1). This motivates to associate P1|2|3,4,5,6 with the worldsheet function
f (2)
12 in (2.32). This reasoning associates ﬁve instances f (2)
16 out of the 15 func-
tions {f (2)
ij , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 6} with a natural kinematic companion P1|2|3,4,5,6, . . . , P1|6|2,3,4,5.
The form of the remaining kinematic factors can be inferred from the symmetry prop-
6 . In contrast to the permutation-invariant expression

11

for KC

6 in (3.4), symmetry of KP

6 under exchange of the unintegrated leg (1 ↔ 2) is
slightly broken by the anomaly. This can be traced back to the diﬀerent response of un-

integrated and integrated vertex operator to gauge variations, see (2.3). The anomalous

BRST variation (2.28) makes reference to V1 in the prescription, and diﬀerent choices of
the unintegrated vertex are related by [25]

QY12,3,4,5,6 = V1Y2,3,4,5,6 − V2Y1,3,4,5,6

(3.10)

with a two-particle version Y12,3,4,5,6 of the anomaly building block (2.23). This BRST
variation reproduces the antisymmetric part of the anomalous gauge variation (2.7), and

a detailed account on the emergence of Y12,3,4,5,6 can be found in appendix A. From this
discussion, the kinematic coeﬃcient of the function f (2)
is symmetric up to the
BRST generator in (3.10) [25],

12 = f (2)

21

hP1|2|3,4,5,6i = hP2|1|3,4,5,6 − Y12,3,4,5,6i .

(3.11)

We interpret the superﬁeld Y12,3,4,5,6 as an anomaly-transporting term between external
legs 1 and 2. Just as the anomalous gauge variation (2.7), its bosonic components are

parity odd,

hY12,3,4,5,6i = −ǫp3p4p5p6q1q2...q6kp3

4 kp5

5 kp6

6 ,

(3.12)

see appendix B of [25] for a general argument.

Accordingly, the coeﬃcient of f (2)

23 cannot follow from a naive relabeling of the legs in
the combination f (2)
12 ↔ s12P1|2|3,4,5,6 since QP2|3|1,4,5,6 = −V2Y1,3,4,5,6. However, we see
from (3.10) that the anomalous BRST variation can be corrected via Y12,3,4,5,6. In view of
(3.11), the natural candidate to multiply the function f (2)

23 is P1|(23)|4,5,6 in (3.8) with

QP1|(23)|4,5,6 = −V1Y2,3,4,5,6 .

(3.13)

The 2 ↔ 3 symmetry suggested by f (2)

23 = f (2)

32 can be checked to hold,

hP1|(23)|4,5,6 − P1|(32)|4,5,6i = hP1|2|3,4,5,6 − P2|1|3,4,5,6 + cyc(1, 2, 3)i

(3.14)

= −hY12,3,4,5,6 + Y23,1,4,5,6 + Y31,2,4,5,6i = 0 ,

where the cyclic combination of Y’s in the second line is BRST trivial under six-particle
momentum conservation km
123456 = 0 [25] (cf. (3.12) for the vanishing of the bosonic com-
ponents). In the interpretation of hY12,3,4,5,6i as an anomaly transportation term, the

12

vanishing of (3.14) can be made plausible since the second line describes an anomaly

transportation around a closed loop 1 → 2 → 3 → 1. Note that an alternative cohomology

representation of P1|(23)|4,5,6 is given by [25]

hP1|(23)|4,5,6i =

The symmetry properties of the anomalous correlator can be summarized as

(3.16)

see appendix A for a derivation from the amplitude prescription (2.1). The analysis in sec-
tion 3.3 will also identify the failure of permutation invariance in hKP
6 i as a boundary term.
In addition to the above plausibility arguments in superspace, we have explicitly tested

the anomalous correlator (3.7) for consistency with the RNS computation of the six-gluon

amplitude. The technical aspects of this consistency check are explained in appendix B.

The RNS computation must be carried out separately for the parity-even and the parity-

odd sector. The former is presented in B.1, mostly guided by the results of [14,32,26]. The

parity-odd counterpart presented in appendix B.2 largely follows the computations in [15]

apart from the presentation of worldsheet functions. In the pure spinor representation of

the correlator in (3.7), both parity sectors are uniﬁed through the component expansion

of the pseudo-invariants hP1|2|3,4,5,6i and hP1|(23)|4,5,6i.

3.3. The BRST and gauge transformations as boundary terms

In this subsection, we discuss the scalar integrals accompanying the anomalous BRST and

gauge variations (3.9) of the six-point amplitude. In particular, they are now demonstrated

to describe boundary terms in the moduli space of open-string worldsheets.

In order to relate the BRST variation (3.9) of KP

to the modular parameter, it is worthwhile to express the functions f (2)
derivative of the bosonic Green function (2.29). For generic complex arguments, the heat
equation 4πi ∂θ1(z|τ )

∂τ = ∂2θ1(z|τ ) obeyed by the theta function in (2.33) implies that

In a convenient parametrization of open-string worldsheets, the arguments zpq, τ of the

The integration domains ∆top for vertex insertions in (2.1) and (3.1) are then given by

∆P = {0 ≤ ν1 ≤ ν2 ≤ . . . ≤ ν6 ≤ t}

∆N = {0 ≤ ν1 ≤ ν2 ≤ . . . ≤ ν6 ≤ 2t}

(3.19)

∆NP = {0 ≤ ν1, ν2 ≤ t and 0 ≤ ν3 . . . ≤ ν6 ≤ t} ,

where ∆P and ∆N are adapted to the single-traces over ta1 ta2 ta3 ta4 ta5 ta6 , and ∆NP refers
to the non-planar cylinder diagram with color factor GNP = tr(ta1 ta2 )tr(ta3ta4 ta5 ta6 ).
Hence, the functional dependence of Gpq on the real parameters νpq and t is given as
follows in the three inequivalent conﬁgurations:

Gpq = G(cid:0)iνpq + δ|it + ε(cid:1) ,

Since the diﬀerence between planar and non-planar cylinders and the M¨obius strip amounts

to a constant shift of its arguments, Gpq in (3.20) satisﬁes a universal diﬀerential equation,

Analogous statements hold for the M¨obius strip.

From (3.21) and (3.22), one can derive a universal relation for f (2)

of open-string worldsheets and the anomaly is canceled for the gauge group SO(32) [20].

This section is devoted to the six-point one-loop amplitude among massless closed-string

organizes the kinematic dependence in a factorized form w.r.t. left- and right-movers.

The compactness and manifest BRST invariance of (4.8) demonstrate the virtue of

vectorial BRST invariants to describe closed-string amplitudes. From the ﬁve-point exam-

ple, one can anticipate that BRST (pseudo-)invariants of rank r ﬁnd a natural appearance
in closed-string amplitudes at higher multiplicity r − 4, along with r powers of π

4.3. Low-energy limits and S-duality of type IIB

In this subsection, we discuss the low-energy limit of one-loop amplitudes among massless

closed-string states and relate it to the S-duality implications in type IIB theory.

As explained in [35,36,28,33], the momentum dependence of torus integrals of the
form (4.8) and (4.9) can be split into analytic and non-analytic contributions8. The leading
analytic behavior α′ → 0 follows unambiguously by setting I(sij) → 1 after taking the
kinematic poles due to integration over d2zI(sij )∂G23∂G23 → 2πdr23 rα′s23−1
with r23 ≡
|z23| into account, see e.g. [28,33]. This gives rise to low-energy limits

with the shorthand notation |Cm

tions. In the six-point case, the expressions (3.4) and (4.10) for KC
6 have been
inserted into (4.9), whereas the expression (4.11) for L6 is treated as unknown at this
point and will be derived in the subsequent. Note that the anomalous part KP
6 of the
open-string correlator does not contribute to the low-energy limit due to the non-singular
nature of the f (2)

ij as zi → zj , see the discussion below (2.32).

6 and Km

At four and ﬁve points, the type IIB graviton components of (4.12) and (4.13) are
proportional to the α′3 order of tree-level amplitudes [37,33]. They originate from the R4
operator in the type IIB low-energy eﬀective action whose tensor structure is determined

by supersymmetry and whose coeﬃcient (determined by S-duality) is given by the non-
holomorphic Eisenstein series E3/2 [38,39,40]. The non-linear extension of R4 equally aﬀects
multiparticle amplitudes at the α′3 order at tree level and in the low-energy limit at one
loop and leads to the following S-duality prediction,

hMN(cid:12)(cid:12)IIB

× (S0M3)σ,ρ ˜AYM(1, ρ(2, 3, . . . , N − 2), N − 1, N )

8 The interplay of the analytic and non-analytic parts of the amplitude as well as subtle

ambiguities at higher α′ order and their resolution are discussed in [36].

18

whose proportionality constant cq does not depend on the multiplicity N . The right-hand
side borrows the notation of [41] for the low-energy expansion of tree-level amplitudes
involving N closed-string states. The entries of the (N − 3)! × (N − 3)! matrices S0 and
M3 are polynomials of degree N − 3 and 3 in the dimensionless Mandelstam invariants
α′(ki ·kj), and S0 is the momentum kernel [42] which appears in the ﬁeld-theory limit of the
KLT formula [43,44]. The matrix M3 captures the α′3 order in the low-energy expansion
of genus-zero worldsheet integrals9.

A slightly modiﬁed argument applies to the components of (4.15) which violate the

U (1) R-symmetry of type IIB supergravity. This is indicated by the subscript q of the

proportionality constant cq in (4.15). The simplest non-vanishing amplitude with U (1)
violation occurs at multiplicity ﬁve and charge q = ±2, involving for instance four gravitons
and one axio-dilaton, see [50,51,33] for its α′-expansion. It was argued via S-duality and
conﬁrmed through explicit calculation that the constants in (4.15) for charges q = 0, ±2
are related by c±2 = − 1
3 c0 [33]. An analogous discussion of the low-energy limit of two-loop
ﬁve-point amplitudes and their dependence on R charges can be found in [5].

Since the coeﬃcient L6 of π2
τ 2
2

in the six-graviton amplitude (4.9) contributes to the

low-energy limit (4.14), it can be determined from the S-duality prediction (4.15). More
precisely, the form of L6 in (4.11) is inferred from the following reasoning.

(4.16)

Now the S-duality prediction relates the low-energy limit of the closed-string amplitude and
the tree-level α′3 terms via (4.15). Demanding the low-energy limit to be BRST invariant
and permutation symmetric10 uniquely ﬁxes L6 to the form (4.11). A component evaluation
for six external gravitons conﬁrms the matching with the tree-level amplitude at order α′3.

9 The explicit form of these matrices for multiplicity N ≤ 7 and the building blocks for N =
8, 9 can be downloaded from [45]. Initially addressed via hypergeometric functions [46,47], the
α′-corrections at tree level for any multiplicity can be recursively generated from the Drinfeld
associator [48]. The organization of these integrals in (N − 3)! × (N − 3)! matrices has been
essential to reveal the structure of the α′-expansion [41], see [49] for relations to the associator.

10 Demonstrating permutation invariance of (4.14) with L6 given by (4.11) requires the canon-

icalization techniques in section 11 of [25].

4.4. The BRST variation as a boundary term

It will be demonstrated in this section11 that the BRST (or gauge) variation of the closed-
string amplitude (4.9) gives rise to a total derivative in moduli space.

The surface integral over the vertex insertions in the second line vanishes because the torus

has no boundaries while the vanishing of the surface integral on moduli space follows from

modular invariance [52,53,54].

5. Conclusion and outlook

In this work we combined the one-loop cohomology analysis of [25] with the worldsheet

functions studied in [26] to write down the complete six-point one-loop amplitudes of

the open and closed string. In doing so, we supplemented the BRST-invariant six-point

correlator (3.4) that captures the worldsheet singularities among the external vertices with

the non-singular pseudo-invariant correlator (3.7). The pseudo BRST invariance allows us

to describe the hexagon gauge anomaly in pure spinor superspace while the non-singular

worldsheet functions capture the regular parts of the correlator. Their composition given

in (3.7) is such that its non-vanishing gauge variation (3.9) gives rise to a total derivative

in moduli space (leading to the usual mechanism of anomaly cancellation [20,29]). This

condition ﬁxes the superspace form of the anomaly-containing part of the open-string

correlator (3.7) and reproduces the bosonic results from earlier analyses within the RNS

framework [14,15].

The (pseudo-)invariant vector and tensor building blocks from the open string allow for

elegant representations for closed-string one-loop amplitudes. As elaborated in section 4,

any basis integral of the closed string is accompanied by a manifestly (pseudo-)invariant

kinematic factor quadratic in the open-string (pseudo-)invariants. In order to arrive at the

novel six-point result, in addition to an OPE-driven derivation of the singular part of the

correlator, we also used S-duality considerations to completely ﬁx its regular terms. This

12 The action of ∂

∂τ on the τ dependent integration domain for zj drops out because the resulting

boundary term zj = τ is suppressed by the Koba–Nielsen factor.

21

organizing principle for closed-string one-loop amplitudes has a natural extension beyond

maximal supersymmetry, see [55] for examples in orbifold compactiﬁcations.

While the results of this paper demonstrate the value of the (pseudo-)cohomology

framework of [25], it is imperative to derive them from ﬁrst principles within the pure spinor

formalism. This endeavor is expected to require a more in-depth understanding of how the

non-zero modes of the b-ghost contribute to the ﬁnal expressions. These contributions

are currently poorly understood and give rise to diﬃculties in extending the results for

higher-loop amplitudes in [4,5] beyond their low-energy limits.

Furthermore, for gauge groups diﬀerent than SO(32), additional boundary terms along
the lines of [56] arise from regularizing the divergent modular integral13. These boundary

terms give rise to worry about additional BRST anomalies and ambiguities associated

with the choice of the regulator N for the non-compact space of pure spinors [17]. Sub-

tleties of this type are not addressed in this work, and their treatment in a manifestly

supersymmetric formalism is left as an interesting open problem.

Appendix A. Permutation behavior of the open-string correlator

In this appendix, we derive the asymmetry (3.16) of the six-point correlator KP

6 from the
prescription (2.1) for open-string amplitudes. It will be demonstrated that an exchange of

the unintegrated leg V1U2 → V2U1 yields a boundary term accompanied by the kinematic
factor hY12,3,4,5,6i in (2.23) with parity-odd bosonic components (3.12).

, and the leftover term V1U2 − V2U1 yields the desired diﬀerence
between K6 and its image under (1 ↔ 2). This completes the proof of (3.16).

Appendix B. Comparison with the RNS computation

We have checked the six-point open-string amplitude (3.7) in pure spinor superspace to

reproduce the gluon amplitude from the RNS formalism upon component expansion [24].

Since this comparison rests on the availability of both expressions in a basis of worldsheet

integrals, we will sketch the underlying integral reduction on the RNS side in this appendix.

the expression (3.4) and (3.7) for KC
integral reduction into three steps:

(i) elimination of double derivatives: Bilinears in ∂xm(zi) from the vertex operator
(B.2) contract to a double derivative ∂2Gij of the Green function (2.29). Since there is
always a partner term α′sij(∂Gij)2 with the same tensor structure from the fermionic
part ∼ ψ2 of the vertex operators, the double pole of ∂2Gij, (∂Gij)2 ∼ 1
turns

out to be spurious. This can be seen from a total derivative relation involving the
Koba–Nielsen factor I from (2.30):

(B.8)

Double poles which cannot be removed via (B.8) would signal tachyon propagation.

(ii) partial fraction relations: Step (i) leaves two topologies of bilinears in the prop-
agator: ∂Gij∂Gik with j 6= k and an overlapping leg i as well as the disconnected
conﬁguration ∂Gij∂Gpq with all of i, j, p, q distinct. The former requires an applica-
tion of the Fay identity (2.34) before the pattern of functions Xij(Xik + Xjk) suitable

(iii) integration by parts: As explained below (3.3), the minimal set of worldsheet func-
tions Xij is obtained by eliminating any instance of X1j by discarding derivatives of
the Koba–Nielsen factor (2.30) w.r.t. zj. This amounts to two equivalent manipula-
tions after step (ii):

B.2. The parity-odd part

The parity-odd sector of the RNS six-point amplitude stems from the spin structure of
ψm with anti-periodic boundary conditions along both cycles of the Riemann surface. In
this case, zero modes of the β, γ ghosts as well as the ten components of ψm have to be

saturated in the path integral. This gives rise to the amplitude prescription

The worldsheet supercurrent ∂xpψp is a remnant of a picture changing operator whose

Wick contraction of ψm is adjusted to the spin structure ψm(zi)ψn(zj) → δmn∂Gij, and

Appendix C. Gauge transformation versus BRST transformation

In this appendix, it is demonstrated that linearized gauge transformations of the external

states are encoded in the BRST variations of the kinematic factors. We thereby prove the

equivalence of the anomalous BRST and gauge variations (3.9) of the six-point open-string

amplitude (3.4) and (3.7).

C.1. Gauge variation of multiparticle superﬁelds

The response of linearized SYM superﬁelds to a superspace gauge transformation δi in

particle i is given by

δiAi

α = DαΩi,

δiAi

m = ki

mΩi,

δiW α

i = δiF mn

i = 0 ,

(C.1)

for scalar superﬁelds Ωi, leading to the variations (2.3) of the massless vertex operators.
For the choice Ωi = eiki·x, the gauge transformation (C.1) amounts to a transverse gluon
polarization em

i → km
i .

The recursive construction of multiparticle superﬁelds AP

α , Am

P , W α

P , F mn

P

in (2.9) to

(2.13) determines their linearized gauge variation from (C.1). As pioneered in appendix B of

[25] and generalized in [23], multiparticle gauge transformations are conveniently captured

by multiparticle gauge scalars

GP ≡

1

sP XXY =P(cid:2)GY (kY · AX ) − GX (kX · AY )(cid:3) .

(C.2)

Performing a linearized gauge transformation (C.1) in a single external leg (say leg i = 1)

amounts to the initial condition Gj = δ1,jΩ1 for the recursion (C.2), i.e. to having only one
non-vanishing single-particle scalar Gj. The induced gauge transformation of multiparticle

superﬁelds is given by [23]

δGAP

α = DαGP + XXY =P
P GP + XXY =P

where the δG operation reduces to the linearized variations (C.1) in any leg i for appropriate
choices of initial conditions. As a consequence, the one-loop building blocks in (2.15) to

(2.19) transform as

δG MA = QGA + XXY =A

2 G2M m

3,4,5,6 +(cid:2)s23G23M4,5,6 + (3 ↔ 4, 5, 6)(cid:3) .

The multiparticle response to gauge variations can be conveniently interpreted by assem-
bling both the gauge scalars GP and the multiparticle superﬁelds AP
m, . . . in a gener-
ating series: While latter solve the non-linear equations of motion of ten-dimensional SYM

α , AP

[58], the resummation of the gauge scalars encodes their non-linear gauge transformations.

The recursion (C.2) is obtained by demanding the non-linear gauge transformations to
preserve the Lorentz-gauge condition for the generating series of AP
m [23]. The beneﬁts of

certain diﬀerent choices of multiparticle gauge scalars are discussed in the reference.

C.2. Gauge variation of BRST (pseudo-)invariants

For all of the kinematic building blocks {MA, MA,B,C, . . .} in the amplitudes under discus-
sion, the BRST variations (2.20), (2.24) and (2.25) closely resemble the gauge variations

(C.7) to (C.11). It is therefore not surprising that BRST invariants such as the scalars
C1|A,B,C and the vectors Cm
1|A,B,C,D in section 2.3 give rise to a Q-exact gauge variation

δGC1|A,B,C = Q(cid:2)C1|A,B,C(cid:12)(cid:12)MP →GP(cid:3) ,

leading to vanishing components,

δGCm

1|A,B,C,D = Q(cid:2)Cm

1|A,B,C,D(cid:12)(cid:12)MP →GP(cid:3) ,

hδGC1|A,B,Ci = 0 ,

hδGCm

1|A,B,C,Di = 0 .

29

(C.12)

(C.13)

For instance the ﬁve-point BRST invariant C1|23,4,5 = M1M23,4,5 + M12M3,4,5 − M13M2,4,5
translates into the gauge variation δGC1|23,4,5 = Q(G1M23,4,5 + G12M3,4,5 − G13M2,4,5)
captured by the replacement MP → GP .

For the tensor M mn

A,B,C,D,E and the anomaly current J2|3,4,5,6, however, the superﬁelds
YA,B,C,D,E in their BRST variations (2.24) and (2.25) do not have any correspondent in the
gauge variations (C.10) and (C.11). That is why the gauge transformation of their pseudo-
invariant completions Cmn
1|2,3,4,5,6 and P1|2|3,4,5,6 in (2.26) and (2.27) exhibit anomalous

admixtures

δGCmn

1|2,3,4,5,6(cid:12)(cid:12)MP →GP(cid:3) − δmnG1Y2,3,4,5,6
1|2,3,4,5,6 = Q(cid:2)Cmn
δGP1|2|3,4,5,6 = Q(cid:2)P1|2|3,4,5,6(cid:12)(cid:12)MP →GP(cid:3) − G1Y2,3,4,5,6 .

(C.14)

(C.15)

The components hδGCmn
1|2,3,4,5,6i and hδGP1|2|3,4,5,6i only depend on G1 whereas any other
Gj6=1 drops out. This reﬂects the initial observation in section 2.1 that gauge transfor-
mations of the integrated vertices U2, . . . , U6 annihilate the six-point amplitude while
the unintegrated vertex V1 yields the anomaly (2.6) upon variation to QΩ1. Setting
Gj → δj,1Ω1eikj x reproduces the anomaly kinematic factor K in (2.7):

hδGCmn

1|2,3,4,5,6i → −

1
2

δmnK ,

hδGP1|2|3,4,5,6i → −

2

K .

(C.16)

Since the gauge anomaly in (C.14) and (C.15) matches the anomalous BRST variations

(2.28), the mechanism of anomaly cancellation is completely analogous for gauge and BRST

transformations, see [20] for open strings, and section 4.4 for the closed-string discussion.
