A symmetric diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax pair for Painlev´e VI

Chris M. Ormerod and Eric Rains

Abstract. We present a Lax pair for the sixth Painlev´e equation arising
as a continuous isomonodromic deformation of a system of linear diﬀerence
equations with an additional symmetry structure. We call this a symmetric
diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax pair. We show how the discrete isomonodromic de-
formations of the associated linear problem gives us a discrete version of the
ﬁfth Painlev´e equation. By considering degenerations we obtain symmetric
diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax pairs for the ﬁfth Painlev´e equation and the various
degenerate versions of the third Painlev´e equation.

1. Introduction

The Painlev´e equations are second order nonlinear diﬀerential equations whose
only movable singularities are poles [5]. The most general case in the classiﬁcation
of the Painlev´e equations is the sixth Painlev´e equation, written in standard form
as

where α, β, γ, δ ∈ C are parameters. For special values of the parameters the solu-
tions of (PV I ) have been used to express classes of Einstein metrics [28], correlation
functions in the 2D Ising model [15], express the eigenvalue distributions for cer-
tain ensembles of random matrices [8] and characterize the reductions of nonlinear
wave equations [19] and the self-dual Yang-Mills equations [18]. As a mathemat-
ical object, (PV I ) possesses a group of B¨acklund transformations that is of aﬃne
Weyl type D(1)
[24], possesses solutions expressible in terms of Gauss’s hypergeo-
4
metric function [13] and admits a surface of initial conditions with a rich geometric
structure [12].

Identifying the sixth Painlev´e equation in applications usually hinges upon
making a correspondence with a known Lax pair. This is usually done by showing
a system arises as an isomonodromic deformation of an associated linear problem of
the right type. The most celebrated example arises as the isomonodromic deforma-
tions of a second order linear diﬀerential equation with four Fuchsian singularities
[9, 10]. This makes the understanding the Lax pairs of (PV I ) critically important

in applications. For this reason, the Lax pairs of (PV I ) have been the subject of
many works [6, 17, 22].

Finding a Lax pair for a given system can be a diﬃcult or even impossible
task. The starting point is usually an ansatz made about the properties of some
associated linear problem, one then tries to show that a given system coincides
with the system of isomonodromic deformations [16]. This ansatz can be guided
by the geometry of the moduli space of linear problems, which may be moduli
spaces systems of linear diﬀerential equations (or connections) [3, 11], or moduli
spaces of diﬀerence equations, which were the subject of an article by one of the
authors [26].

The goal of this paper is to present a new Lax pair for (PV I ) which has been
derived as a continuous isomonodromic deformation of a system of linear diﬀerence
equations. We may write this system in matrix form as

(1.1a)

Y (x + 1) =A(x)Y (x),

where x is called a spectral variable. The isomonodromic deformations are with
respect to a new independent variable, t, in which the evolution in t governed by
an auxiliary linear problem of the form

(1.1b)

dY (x)

dt

=B(x)Y (x).

We call Lax pairs that take the form (1.1a) and (1.1b) diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax
pairs. A novel feature of the Lax pair for (PV I ) we present is the presence of an
additional symmetry; that the solutions of (1.1a) satisfy

(1.2)

Y (x) = Y (−x − σ),

where σ ∈ C. We call Lax pairs of this form symmetric diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax
pairs. By considering degenerations of the Lax pair we present we also obtain
symmetric diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax pairs for

From the classiﬁcation of Painlev´e equations by their surface of initial conditions
[27] the three versions of the third Painlev´e equation have surfaces of initial condi-
tions with distinct symmetry groups, hence, should be considered as distinct cases.
In particular, (PIII(D7)) and (PIII (D8)) do not admit the ﬁrst Painlev´e equation
as a limit. A degeneration diagram is shown in ﬁgure 1.

Amongst the known Lax pairs for the Painlev´e equations appearing in ﬁgure
1, we note that there are diﬀerential-diﬀerential Lax pairs for each of the Painlev´e

equations [14, 23]. However, there are relatively few works that consider continuous
isomonodromic deformations of linear diﬀerence equations. Diﬀerence-diﬀerential
Lax pairs for PI, PII, PIV , PV and PV I all appear in [1], however, to our best
knowledge, the diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax pairs for the versions of PIII we present
are the only diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax pairs known.

We organize this article as follows; in §2 we present some background on known
Lax pairs of the sixth Painlev´e equation. In §3 we present our new Lax pair and
a system of isomonodromic deformations. In §4 we present a general form of the
Lax pair, which makes it clear how one degenerates the Lax pair to give (PV ),
(PIII(D6)), (PIII (D7)) and (PIII (D8)). In §5, we present a simple form of (PV I )
in which the limits to versions of (PV ), (PIII (D6)), (PIII(D7)) and (PIII (D8))
easily follow.

2. Background and motivation

In 1905, it was reported by R. Fuchs that if a scalar linear diﬀerential equation
with four regular singular points, located at 0, 1, t and ∞ and one apparent singular-
ity at a value y, were to possess a monodromy representation that was independent
of the singular point t, then y necessarily satisﬁes (PV I ). We may transform this
to the second order Fuchsian diﬀerential equation, giving the following result.

Theorem 2.1 ([9, 10]). The isomonodromic deformations of the second order

linear diﬀerential equation

φxx(x, t) + τ1(x, t)φx(x, t) + τ2(x, t)φ(x, t) = 0,

Proof. If we move t in a continuous manner, we may use (2.1) to express the

evolution in t in the general form

(2.2)

φt(x, t) + σ1(x, t)φx(x, t) + σ2(x, t)φ(x, t) = 0.

We can compute σ1(x, t) and σ2(x, t) by comparing the two ways of calculating
φxxt(x, t); either by taking the derivative in t of (2.1) or the second derivative in x
of (2.2). In each case, these may be expressed as linear combinations of φ(x, t) and
φx(x, t). Comparing these expressions is equivalent to Hamilton’s equations, given
by

which is equivalent to y(t) satisfying (PV I ) for the above parameters.

(cid:3)

The equations (2.1) and (2.2) in this calculation constitute a diﬀerential-diﬀerential

Lax pair for (PV I ). Alternatively, one may express the isomonodromic deformation
problem in terms of matrices. It was the work of Jimbo, Miwa and Ueno that ex-
tended the work on isomonodromic deformations from systems with only Fuchsian
singularities to systems of diﬀerential equations with higher order singularities. It
is in this work we ﬁnd the following parameterization of a Lax pair for (PV I ) in
terms of matrices [14].

then moving the parameter t isomonodromically requires that y = y(t) satisﬁes

This should be analogous to taking the deformation equation to be a linear system
of the form (1.1b). The compatibility requires that the mixed derivatives agree,
giving the condition

(2.10)

In fact, by taking

then the residues of (2.10) at x = 0, x = 1 and x = t give (2.7), (2.8) and (2.9)
respectively. Computing the entries of (2.10) gives

Eliminating z from this equation shows y satisﬁes (PV I ) for the given parameters.
(cid:3)

The equations (2.4) and (1.1b) where B(x) is speciﬁed by (2.11) constitute a
diﬀerential-diﬀerential Lax pair for (PV I ). We consider the scalar Lax pair, (2.1)
and (2.2), and the matrix Lax pair, (2.4) and (2.11) to be characteristically the
same since it is trivial to convert (2.1) into a matrix form and (2.4) into a scalar
form.

To obtain a characteristically diﬀerent Lax pair, let us consider the above cal-
culations in a geometric framework. A useful geometric relaxation of the notion of
a linear system of diﬀerential equations is the notion of a connection on a vector
bundle, say V . We recover the notion of a matrix diﬀerential equation when we
restrict our attention the case in which V = On
P1 (copies of sheaves of holomorphic
functions on P1).
In this setting, (PV I ) may be interpreted as a ﬂow on the 2-
dimensional moduli space of second order Fuchsian linear diﬀerential equation with
four singular points and speciﬁed exponents at those points. This moduli space has
the structure of a rational surface with an anticanonical divisor Y = −K with a
decomposition into ﬁve irreducible components, one of these components has mul-
tiplicity 2. This means the moduli space may be identiﬁed as the surface of initial
conditions for (PV I ).

Diﬀerence equations can also be viewed as maps between the ﬁbres of a vector
bundle [2], however, this identiﬁcation still hinges upon identifying a map as matrix
(through trivializing the vector bundle). The both the moduli space of matrices
and maps between vector bundles may be interpreted as moduli spaces of sheaves
on a smooth projective variety. These relaxations of the diﬀerence equations and
their moduli spaces have been the subject of a recent study [26]. These moduli
spaces can have much the same structure as their continuous counterparts, hence,
our motivation was to ﬁnd a moduli space of diﬀerence equations that could also
be identiﬁed with the surface of initial conditions for (PV I ). The canonical ﬂow on
this surface should and does correspond to (PV I ), as we will demonstrate.

CHRIS M. ORMEROD AND ERIC RAINS

One way to ﬁnd a moduli space systems of linear diﬀerence equations of the
same type as a given linear system of diﬀerential equations is via Z-transform.
This is an invertible transformation that turns a linear diﬀerential equation into a
linear diﬀerence equation. We suppose that a solution of (2.1) is given by a formal
biinﬁnite power series,

φ(x, t) = Xχ∈Z

a(χ, t)xχ,

then the coeﬃcients, a(χ, t) satisfy a non-autonomous linear diﬀerence in the vari-
able χ. While applying this procedure to (2.1) directly results in a third order
equation, we may transform this into a second order diﬀerential equation in which
the entries are at most quadratic in the new spectral variable. This allows us to
obtain a diﬀerence equation of the form (1.1a) where

A(x) = A0 + A1x + A2x2,

with the properties that A2 has eigenvalues 1 and t, the trace of A1 is constant and
the determinant of A(x) is of quartic. We let a1, . . . , a4 be the roots of det A(x), in
which case we write

(2.12)

det A(x) = t(x − a1)(x − a2)(x − a3)(x − a4).

The moduli space of such matrices up to gauge equivalence is a rational surface.

Due to the invertible nature of the Z-transform, and the results of [12], we
expect this moduli space to coincide with the space of initial conditions for (PV I )
on an open subset of the surface. Exploiting some freedom in how we choose A(x)
allows us to simplify the associated linear problem to the following

(2.13)

A(x) = (x − z)(x − τ1)y1

τ3x + τ4

w

w(x − z)

t(x − z)(x − τ2) + y2! ,

where we may solve the relations a the coeﬃcients of x in (2.12) by letting

(2.14a)

(2.14b)

(2.14c)

(2.14d)

with

(2.15)

τ1 = −σ − z,
τ2 = a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + σ − z,

.

This forms a suitable parameterization of the given linear system of diﬀerence
equations in terms of three variables, y, z and w.

Theorem 2.3. The continuous isomonodromic deformation of the linear sys-
tem speciﬁed by (1.1a) with A(x) given by (2.13), (2.14) and (2.15) in t requires

Proof. While there are very few works on the continuous isomonodromic de-
formations of linear systems of diﬀerence equation, we follow the work of [1] by
parameterizing the isomonodromic deformations via (2.2) where B(x) is linear.
The compatibility between equations of the form (1.1a) and (2.2) may be written

(2.16)

dA(x)

dt

+ A(x)B(x) − B(x + 1)A(x) = 0.

We ﬁnd that (2.16) is overdetermined when B(x) is linear, hence, we may write

B(x) =

x

where the other relations give us

Eliminating z from this system gives us the result.

(cid:3)

The equations (1.1a) and (1.1b) for A(x) and B(x) given by (2.13) and (2.17a)
respectively constitutes a diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax pair for (PV I ). This result is
essentially a diﬀerent parameterization of the Lax pair that appeared in [1].

The linear system of the form (1.1a) with A(x) given by (2.13) is also connected
to a known Lax pair for the discrete version of the ﬁfth Painlev´e equation [7]. We
consider the discrete version of the ﬁfth Painlev´e equation to be the map

.

This transformation is a B¨acklund transformation of (PV I ) which commutes with
the time evolution of (PV I ).

The way in which a Lax pair for (d-PV ) arises is that a1, . . . , a4, σ appear as
variables that change by integer shifts under the action of discrete isomonodromic
deformations [4]. A discrete isomonodromic deformation is a transformation in-
duced by a gauge transformation of the form

(2.18)

˜Y (x) = R(x)Y (x),

8

CHRIS M. ORMEROD AND ERIC RAINS

where R(x) is some rational matrix. We expect ˜Y (x) to satisfy an equation of the
form

˜Y (x + 1) = ˜A(x) ˜Y (x),

where ˜A(x) and A(x) are related by

(2.19)

˜A(x)R(x) − R(x + 1)A(x).

Our nonautonomous diﬀerence equation arises from identifying this as a map from
the moduli spaces containing A(x) to the moduli space of matrices containing ˜A(x)
in some canonical coordinate system.

Theorem 2.4. Given (1.1a) with A(x) given by (2.13), the discrete isomon-

odromic deformation induced by (2.18) when R(x) takes the form

R(x) =

zI + R0

(x − a1 − 1)(x − a2 − 1)

.

is equivalent to (d-PV ).

Proof. We may derive the entries of R0 in a number of ways, we may compute
the residues of (2.19) at the points x = a1, x = a2, x = a1 + 1 and x = a2 + 1, or
compare the expansions in x around x = 0 and x = ∞. We ﬁnd a suitable form of
R0 to be

t(a3 + a4 + σ)

1 − a1 − a2 + z +

The overdetermined compatibility of (2.19) results in (d-PV ) and

˜w

which is the equation satisﬁed by the variable encapsulating the gauge freedom. (cid:3)

We consider the equations (1.1a) with A(x) given by (2.13) and (2.18) to be a
diﬀerence-diﬀerence Lax pair. This Lax pair was a result of Arinkin and Borodin
[2] (see also [7]).

3. Symmetric diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax pair

One of the corollaries of the work on moduli spaces of diﬀerence equations was
the existence of two moduli spaces of systems of linear diﬀerence equations of second
order with the same structure as the space of initial conditions for (PV I ). One
of these moduli spaces corresponded to a diﬀerence-diﬀerential Lax pair without
symmetry, as given by Adler [1], while the other possesses some symmetry with 4
pairs of symmetric singular points. In this section, we provide a parameterization
of the resulting Lax pair that gives (PV I ) as a system of continuous isomonodromic
deformations.

We recently outlined a discrete version of the Garnier system in which the
solutions of the associated linear problem are even functions [25]. A small general-
ization of this is to consider system of diﬀerence equations symmetric around some

A SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE-DIFFERENTIAL LAX PAIR FOR PAINLEV ´E VI

9

value. We wish to consider these diﬀerence equations as pairs of equations of the
form

(3.1a)

(3.1b)

Y (−x − σ − 1) = A(x)Y (x),

Y (−x − σ) = Y (x),

for some σ ∈ C. The combination of (3.1a) and (3.1b) recovers (1.1a), hence, we
consider this to be a system of linear diﬀerence equations. This extra constraint is
motivated by the additional structure that many elliptic hypergeometric functions
and elliptic biorthogonal functions possess.

For the system deﬁned by (3.1), by (3.1b), it is easy to show that A(x) must

necessarily satisfy the condition

(3.2)

A(x)A(−x − σ − 1) = I.

As discussed in [25], we may always write A(x) in the form

(3.3)

A(x) = B(−x − σ − 1)−1B(x),

where B(x) is rational. Without loss of generality, we may multiply by scalar
factors so that B(x) is a polynomial. Furthermore, gauge transformations of the
form (2.18) have the eﬀect of multiplying B(x) only by a factor on the right, whereas
B(x) itself is only deﬁned up to multiplication by a factor on the left. In particular,
matrix B(x) from (3.3) is subject to constant gauge transformations on the left and
the right.

To make a correspondence the previous section we let

We may use the gauge freedom on the left and the right to simplify all but one
entry, which we choose to be the (2, 1) entry. This means that we may generally
take B(x) to be of the form

(3.5)

B(x) =(cid:18) (x − λ1)(x − z) + y1

b0 + b1x + b2x2 + b3x3

where the bi and yj for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and j = 1, 2 are speciﬁed up to one parameter
by (3.4). These values are

(3.6)

By suitable gauge transformations, we may take λ1 = λ2 = 0, since they are
constant with respect to the continuous isomonodromic deformations. We do not
simplify in this way because they satisfy some diﬀerence equation with respect to
the discrete isomonodromic deformations. They essentially play the same role as
w in the previous section, i.e., they are variables encapsulating some left and right
gauge freedom.

To obtain (PV I ) we let

y1 = (z − a1)(z − a2)y,

y2 =

t(z − a3)(z − a4)

y

.

These values of bi and yj for i = 0, . . . , 4 and j = 1, 2 are suﬃcient to ensure that
(3.4) is satisﬁed.

Proof. The goal is to relate the isomonodromic deformations to an evolu-
tion equation for B(x), which, if done correctly, preserves the symmetry condition
for A(x). In terms of Y (x), the isomonodromic deformations are speciﬁed by an
equation of the form

(3.10)

dY (x)

dt

= Br(x)Y (x),

where Br(x) must satisfy Br(x) = Br(−σ − x) due to the symmetry condition. We
also note that B(x) is only determined up to scalar matrix multiplication on the
left, by some factor Bl(x) satisfying Bl(x) = Bl(−x − σ − 1). These two conditions
result in a consistency condition in which we have matrices acting upon the left
and right of B(x). The resulting symmetric analogue of (2.16) is

(3.11)

dB(x)

dt

= Bl(x)B(x) − B(x)Br(x).

When Bl(x) and Br(x) are linear in x(x + σ) and x(x + σ + 1) we have an overde-
termined system with Bl(x) and Br(x) given by

These two equations coincides precisely with (2.17) from the previous section. Fol-
lowing the same steps, we eliminate z to show that y satisﬁes (PV I ) for the given
choice of parameters.
(cid:3)

The above shows that (3.1a), (3.1b) and (3.10) constitutes a Lax pair for (PV I ).
However, due to the way in which we factor A(x), the consistency condition, (3.11),
is more naturally expressed in terms of B(x) rather than A(x).

One of the most interesting aspects of the symmetric Lax pairs is the existence
of classes of symmetries that do not appear naturally in the work of Schlesinger
transformations [14]. It is very natural to ask what the analogue of the Schlesinger
transformations look like in the symmetric setting, in particular, how does (d-PV )
arise as a discrete isomonodromic deformation of a symmetric system of diﬀerence
equations.

We ﬁnd that the evolution of (d-PV ) is expressible in terms of the composition
of three transformations, none of which simply shift the variables in the same way as
the Schlesinger transformations in the asymmetric setting. It should be noted that
while the composition of the transformations commutes with the time evolution of
(PV I ), the individual transformations are reﬂections in the sense of the aﬃne Weyl
symmetries of (PV I ), hence, do not necessarily commute with the time evolution.
One interesting consequence of relating the parameters of (d-PV ) to (3.1a) and
(3.1b) is that the value of σ is shifted with evolution of (d-PV ), signifying that
we seek a transformation in which the resulting symmetry is changed. Suppose we
consider a transformation of the form (2.18), where R(x) = B(−x − σ). If A(x) is
given by (3.3), then by using (2.19) we ﬁnd that ˜A(x) is given by

˜A(x) = B(x)B(−x − σ)−1.

This transformation changes the symmetry of the system as we notice that ˜A(x)
satisﬁes

˜A(x) ˜A(−x − ˜σ − 1) = I.

If we denote the new value of σ by ˜σ, then the above indicates that ˜σ = σ − 1. By
suitably multiplying by the determinant, we have that the relevant transformation
is given by

˜B(x) =t(x + σ + a1)(x + σ + a2)

(x + σ + a3)(x + σ + a4)B(−x − σ)−1,

which also corresponds to the adjoint. This means that the eﬀect on the parameters,
y and z, are given by

The auxiliary variables, λ1 and λ2 satisfy ˜λ1 = −σ − λ2 and ˜λ2 = −σ − λ1 respec-
tively.

For the second transformation, we consider a matrix acting on the left of B(x).
As we explored in a recent paper on discrete Garnier systems, we seek a transfor-
mation in which we take two parameters, in the case that is relevant, we take a3
and a4, and send them to −a3 − σ − 1 and −a4 − σ − 1 respectively. Note that this
matrix is easily calculated from the Lax equation

(3.16)

(x − a3)(x − a4) ˜B(x) = Rl(x)B(x),

which is induced by a matrix Rl(x) with the property that Rl(x) = Rl(−x − σ − 1).
This calculation shows

where the variables λ1 and λ2 become λ1 +y(z − ˜z) and λ2 +t−1y(z − ˜z) respectively
where by ˜z we mean the transformed value of z.

The last transformation to form (d-PV ) is a transformation that acts on the
right of B(x). We take a1 and a2 and send these values to −a1 − σ and −a2 − σ
respectively. The relevant Lax equation for this transformation is given by

(3.17)

(x − a1)(x − a2) ˜B(x) = B(x)Rr(x),

where Rr(x) = Rr(−x − σ). It easy to calculate this matrix from the properties of
B(x) and (3.17). This calculation leads us to

respectively.

Corollary 3.2. The discrete version of the ﬁfth Painlev´e equation arises as a
discrete isomonodromic deformation, (2.2), of (1.1a) with A(x) given by (3.3) and
(3.5) for

R(x) = (Br(x)S1 )−1B(−x − σ)

A SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE-DIFFERENTIAL LAX PAIR FOR PAINLEV ´E VI

13

where Br(x)S1 denotes the value of Br(x) with the action of S1 applied to the
entries.

Proof. By using (2.19) and (3.3) we have that

(3.18)

(3.19)

˜A(x) = R(x + 1)B(−x − σ − 1)−1B(x)R(x)−1

= (Br(x + 1)S1)−1B(x)B(−x − σ)−1Br(x)S1

however, we use the fact that

B(−x − σ)−1 =

(x + a1 + σ)(x + a2 + σ)(x + a3 + σ)(x + a4 + σ)

B(x)S1

and note that Br(x)S1 is symmetric around σ − 1 (as opposed to σ). This means
the above may be written as

˜A(x) =

(x − a1)(x − a2)(x − a3)(x − a4)

(x + a1 + σ)(x + a2 + σ)(x + a3 + σ)(x + a4 + σ)

where B(x)S1 Br(x)S1 = B(x)S3 ◦S1 , giving

(cid:0)B(−x − σ)S1 Br(−x − σ)S1(cid:1)−1(cid:0)B(x)S1 Br(x)S1(cid:1) ,
(x + a3 + σ)(x + a4 + σ)(cid:0)B(−x − σ)S3 ◦S1(cid:1) B(x)S3 ◦S1 .

(x − a3)(x − a4)

We now note that this formulation is only deﬁned up to some left multiplication
by Bl(x)S1 ◦S3 (which now satisﬁes Bl(x)S1 ◦S3 = Bl(−σ − x)S1 ◦S3 ), which recovers
the remaining part of the calculation, showing

˜A(x) =(cid:0)B(−x − σ)S2 ◦S3◦S1(cid:1)−1

B(x)S2 ◦S3◦S1 .

Since each transformation, (S1), (S2) and (S3), has a simple eﬀect on the parameters
y and z, it is easy to see that (d-PV ) arises as the composition of (S1) followed by
(S3) and then (S2).
(cid:3)

4. The list of symmetric Lax pairs

We simplify the above situation a little by letting σ = 0 and by letting λ1 =
λ2 = 0. These simpliﬁcations are perfectly valid for considering the diﬀerence diﬀer-
ential Lax pairs. These values only change when one is calculating the symmetries,
as we have done for (PV I ) above but we do not present for the cases below.

Under these simplifying assumptions, each of the Lax pairs we present takes

the form (1.1a) in which A(x) is given by

A(x) = B(−x − 1)−1B(x),

where B(x) takes the form

(4.1)

B(x) =(cid:18)

x(x − z) + y1

b0 + b1x + b2x2 + b3x3 x(x − z) + y2(cid:19) ,

x − z

where the bi and yj for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and j = 1, 2 are speciﬁed up to one parameter
by a determinant.

where a1 and a2 are roots of det B(x). Secondly, we obtain a version of (PV ) when
m4 = 0, and a version of (PIII (D6)) when m4 = m3 = 0 and so on.

6. Discussion

One of the interesting features of this work is that the symmetric Lax pairs
seem to have a larger group of symmetries than that of the non-symmetric cases.
For the non-symmetric cases, the relevant group acting on the parameter space has
the structure of a lattice, whereas in the symmetric case, we have a group generated
by a pairs of transformations, each pair is the generator of some inﬁnite dihedral
group. This setting is much closer to the aﬃne Wey symmetries of the Painlev´e
equations [20] and the discrete Painlev´e equations [21].
