Abstract

In this contribution a geometric approach to describe a rotating fullerene molecule with Ih

symmetry is developed. We analyze the quantum dynamics of quasiparticles in continuum limit

considering a description of fullerene in a spherical solution of the G¨odel-type space-time with a

topological defect. As a result, we study the molecule in a rotating frame. Also we combine the

well know non-Abelian monopole approach with this geometric description, including the case of

the presence of the external Aharonov-Bohm ﬂux. The energy levels and the persistent current

for this study are obtained, and we show that they depend on the geometrical and topological

properties of the fullerene. Also, we verify recovering of the well known results for limiting cases.

INTRODUCTION

The fullerene discovered by Kroto, Curl and Smalley [1] in 1996 is a new allotropic form

of carbon with spherical symmetry. This molecule is formed by arranging 12 pentagonal

rings combined with 20 hexagonal rings of carbon atoms. Thus, the fullerenes are carbon

allotropic forms which can be described by curved space, that is, the sphere. The geometric

description of the fullerene was ﬁrstly developed by Gonzales, Guinea and Vozmediano [2, 3]

with use of a tight-binding model. They showed that the Fermi surface is reduced to two

points, K-points, located in the Brillouin zone, and the electrons in this structure obey the

massless Dirac equation for fermions [4–6]. The fullerene can be described by a spherical

lattice of Ih symmetry, where the presence of pentagonal rings demonstrates the impact of

topological defects in this spherical structure. These defects are responsible for the presence

of pentagons and are denominated as disclination. The formation of this disclination in a

crystalline structure can be viewed with the called Volterra process [7].

In this process,

disclination can be created by the cut and glue process. Disclinations are topological defects

associated with curvature and are characterized by the Frank vector. A geometric formulatio

for this topological defects was developed by Katanaev and Volovich [8], in this theory, the

continuum description for disclinations and dislocation is given with use of curved space

with curvature and torsion.

In two-dimensional systems of condensed matter the presence of disclinations is quite

relevant for physical properties of this systems. The study of the inﬂuence of disclinations in

curved structures of graphene employing Dirac equation approach to describe the dynamics

of a quasiparticle in this material, have been relatively well performed in the Refs. [9–18].

The eﬀect of curvature introduced by disclination in this carbon structure induces an eﬀective

gauge ﬁeld generated by the variation of the local reference frame [4–6, 9, 17–19]:

forcing a mixture of the Fermi points (K±), and generating a non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld (or a

K-spin ﬂux) as demonstrated by [17, 18], which compensates the discontinuity of the Bravais

labels (A/B):

where τ 2 is the second Pauli matrix that mixes the K+ and K− components of the spinor on

the K± space. In other words, the mixture of Fermi points induces an eﬀective ﬁeld arising

due to a ﬁctitious magnetic monopole in the center of the Ih fullerene by replacing the ﬁelds

of 12 disclinations.

The ﬁrst model to describe electrons in C60 was proposed by Gonzales, Guinea and Voz-

mediano [2, 3]. In this model the fullerene is described by a non-Abelian magnetic monopole

introduced in the centre of a two-dimensional sphere. The ﬁeld produced by this monopole

represents the ﬁelds of twelve disclinations presenting in the Ih symmetry of the fullerene

molecule. This model establishes the ﬁrst approach to study of fullerene using a Dirac equa-

tion to describe low energy electrons in C60 molecule. Another description for fullerene in

which a gauge ﬁeld theory is used to describe topological defects, was used by Kolesnikov and

Osipov [20]. In this model the pentagonal rings in fullerene are described by two gauge ﬁelds,

with one of them is used to introduce the elastic properties of disclinations, and the second

gauge ﬁeld, is a non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld describing the K-spin ﬂuxes. In recent years, some

studies of fullerene molecules were employing the continuous model to describe electronic

properties of spheroidal fullerenes, see [21–23]. Recently, two of us have used the geometric

theory of defects to describe fullerene molecule. In this study the well known non-Abelian

monopole approach [2, 3] was combined with the geometric theory of defects [8] to obtain

the energy levels and the persistent current [24]. Therein, the Dirac equation for a spherical

geometry with topological defects and in the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm ﬂux was solved,

and the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for this problem were exactly determined.

Recently, the study of theoretical models consideringthe inﬂuence of rotation in curved

carbon structures has been carried out. Shen and He [26] used Schr¨odinger equation to study

the arising of Aharonov-Carmi eﬀect [25] on a rotating molecules of fullerene. In a recent

study, Lima et. al.

[27, 28] investigated the eﬀect of rotation in the electronic spectrum

fullerene molecules using non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds [2, 20] to describe the defect and non-

inertial eﬀects, including rotation of the reference frame in the Dirac equation. The inﬂuence

of rotation in nanotubes of carbon was also investigated in [29]. In the present contribution,

we investigate the inﬂuence of rotation in the spectrum of energy fullerene molecule using

a geometric description and the well known non-Abelian monopole approach [2, 3]. The

geometry of spherical rotating body is introduced via a three-dimensional spherical G¨odel

solution with presence of topological defects.

Here, we associate a doublet of spinors interacting with a characteristic curvature of space

3

and with a curvature accumulated in a pentagonal defects (conical singularities) via gauge

ﬁeld (Aµ) from the ﬁctitious magnetic monopole in the centre. In order to put the contents

of spherical fullerene under rotation, we assume the mapping of a Ih fullerene in a spherical

three-dimensional solution (l2 < 0) of a G¨odel-type space-time with z = 0 (See Appendix).

Also, we study the change in spectrum of the C60 molecule when when this is crossed by a

magnetic ﬂux tube in the direction z .

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief review of the geometric

approach for a fullerene molecule, where its dynamics is well represented by an eﬀective

Dirac equation in curved spaces. We show how to put this content of matter under rotation

through a model of continuous in the spherical Godel-type metric. In Section 3, we consider

the presence of a Aharonov-Bohm magnetic ﬂux and discuss how the presence of magnetic

ﬂux shifts the spectrum. Also, we show the emergence of the persistent current, and we

compare how the non-inertial characteristics change the spectrum and this persistent current.

In Section 4, we discuss the results obtained in the paper.

II. GEOMETRIC APPROACH TO A FULLERENE MOLECULE IN A NON-

INERTIAL FRAME

In this section we present the approach used to describe a fullerene molecule in a non-

inertial frame. For this we consider the mapping of a fullerene under rotation in a space-time

with spherical symmetry descendant of a G¨odel-type solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equations.

In this space-time, the conical singularities induce a non-zero curvature in space. So, we

combine two treatments: a non-Abelian monopole approach that is already very well known

[44, 45] and the geometry theory of defects of Katanaev and Volovich [8], based on the

equivalence between three-dimensional gravity with torsion and the theory of defects in

solids. Thus, the molecule with conical singularities can be described by a Riemann-Cartan

geometry. The choice of one spherical G¨odel-type solution is motivated by the fact that it

represents a cosmological solution where the content material is rotated. It is interesting to

note that the relationship between the geometric approach and the physics of the electronic

structure of the molecule is well described at low energies, around a few tens of eV around

the K-points. It is still useful for elucidating a long-distance physics, since we note that the

eigenfunctions of the low-energy levels do not oscillate too rapidly at a distance [63]. Thus,

4

we consider the situation in the neighbourhood of the defects. In this geometric approach,

we consider the fullerene molecule under rotation in terms of a two-dimensional spherical

geometry with a rotation is labelled as Ω. Now, we consider G¨odel solution of spherical

symmetry, that correspond a rotating body with vorticity (rotation) about the z-axis (see

Appendix for details of G¨odel-type metric solution in Gravitation).

In this solution which was well studied in the context of gravity by [35–37], the G¨odel

metric is described by following line element:

ds2 = −(cid:20)dt + αΩ

sinh2(lr)

l2

dφ(cid:21)2

+ α2 sinh2(2lr)

4l2

dφ2 + dr2 + dz2,

(3)

with the variables (r, φ, z, t) can take, respectively, the following values: 0 ≤ r < ∞, 0 ≤ φ ≤
2π, −∞ < (z, t) < ∞, and α is related to the angular sector λ removed/inserted from/into
a spherical sheet in order to form the two conical defects in the sphere by the expression
α = 1 ± λ/2π. Indeed, to respect the symmetries of the carbon network, λ can only be
±Nπ/3, where N is an integer in the interval (0, 6). Values of α in the interval, 0 < α < 1,
mean that we remove a sector of the sphere to form two topological defects in the antipodal

point. Taking into account the theory of Katanaev and Volovich [8], the elastic continuous

medium with topological defect is represented by a three-dimensional space with curvature

and torsion. We can see that the spherical G¨odel-type solution as a description of a spherical

body with defects rotating around the z-axis. As we are studying the fullerene like a C60

buckyball, it is appropriate to do dz = 0 in Eq. (3), and we introduce the new convenient

coordinates: R = i/2l and θ = r/R, resulting in

ds2 = −(cid:20)dt + 4αΩR2 sin2(cid:18) θ

2(cid:19)dφ(cid:21)2

+ R2(cid:0)dθ2 + α2 sin2 θdφ2(cid:1)

(4)

It is noteworthy that we are adopting natural units c =  = G = 1. Also, when we

consider Ω = 0 and α = 1, the metric reduces to the Minkowski space. When l2 = Ω2/2 and

α = 1 we recover the original solution obtained by G¨odel [32]. This metric corresponds to

the elastic space-time surrounding the defect and provides all the informations required to

characterize the physical system.

The bases of this space-time are known as tetrads (ea

µ(x)), which are deﬁned at each

point in space-time by a local reference frame gµν(x) = ηabea

ν. The tetrad and its inverse,

(eµ

map the space-time reference frame via the local reference frame [64]:

(5)

Greek indices (µ, ν) run for space-time frame coordinates and the Latin indices (a, b) run

for local frame coordinates. For the local reference frame (θa = ea

µ(x)dxµ), we choose the

tetrads:

the K-points as a matrix in (2 + 1)-dimensions where the Dirac matrices γa are reduced
in our case to the Pauli matrices γa = σa, and the matrix σ0 = I is the 2 × 2 identity
matrix, thereby determining the pseudo-spin degrees of freedom. So, the resulting spinorial

Next, we solve the Dirac equation on the surface of a sphere with a ﬁctitious magnetic

monopole at its centre. The charge g of the ﬁctitious magnetic monopole is adjusted by

adding up the individual ﬂuxes of all the lines[3]

[45, 65]. The spectrum is obtained by solving the covariant Dirac operator,

In such

and it is well reported by

(12)

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that τ (2) acts only in the space of K± spinor components,

while σa, existing in spinorial connection (Γµ), only acts on the geometry. When these

matrices operate in diﬀerent subspaces, we can decouple the doublet (ψ±). In this case we

will have a rotation in the monopole ﬁeld, thus we obtain a frame where τ (2) is diagonal:

this case (11) is reduced to the following

III. THE ROTATING FULLERENE IN THE PRESENCE OF AHARONOV-

BOHM FLUX TUBE

In this section, we consider the geometric model described by the Dirac equation (15) in

the presence of Aharonov-Bohm ﬂux. This ﬂux represents a magnetic string that goes from

pole to pole in the C60 buckyball. This is the same as assuming the molecule to be under
the inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld ~B = Bz ˆz where Bz = ΦBδ(r). This ﬂux is associated with

a vector potential in the local reference frame by [24, 66, 67]

Thus, using the minimal coupling to include the potential vector (16) in Dirac equation

(15), after replacing the inverse of the tetrads (eµ

It is interesting to note that for Ω = 0 we restore the inertial case [24]. Moreover, it is worth

noting that the inversely proportional dependence between ǫn,m and R do not change the

separation between levels. In fact ΦB operate as a shift in the z-component of the angular

momentum. Also it should be noted that when α = 1, ΦB = 0 and Ω = 0, we recover the

results obtained by Kolesnikov and Osipov [63]. Also, when g = 0 and ΦB = 0, we replicate

the approach stated by Imura [68], for a dynamics of the fermions in a spherical topological

insulator. Now, consider the following limit Ω << 1 in (24) we obtain the following equation:

Note that the equation (25) is the same found in Ref. [27] for Φ = 0 and α = 1. In this way,

in the slow rotation limit we recover the results obtained in [27]. Also, the ﬁrst term is the

same contribution obtained by Shen [26] for Aharonov-Carmi [25] eﬀect.

A. The obtaining of the persistent current

Next, we calculate the persistent current for our model of fullerene drilled by a chiral

magnetic string.

Indeed, persistent currents were ﬁrst observed in superconducting rings

[70], while studying the transition around the critical temperature under the inﬂuence of

an external magnetic ﬁeld. Then, after removing the external ﬁeld, a residual current is

observed. It should be noted that these persistent currents are not caused by outside sources,

but feature a quantum eﬀect, and present not only in superconductors but also in usual

conductor and semiconductor materials. It is calculated using the Byers-Yang relation [71]

given by,

I = −Xn,m

∂ǫn,m

∂ΦB (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)T =0

.

(26)

This relation expresses the persistent current for T = 0 as a derivative of the energy with

respect to the magnetic ﬂux of the chiral string. We now obtain the following expression for

the persistent current,

Note that the persistent current depends on the parameters α and g, which characterize the

presence of topological defects, as well as the rotation parameter Ω. We recover the inertial

case [24] when Ω = 0. Now, we consider the limit where Ω << 1 in (27). In this way we

Notice that in the slow rotation limit Ω << 1, we can separate two contributions for persis-

tent current. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (28), directly associated to Ω, and the second term, that

is the same found in Ref. [24].

IV. CONCLUSION

We have investigated a geometric description of the rotating C60 fullerenes within the

continuum ﬁeld theory approach. For this model we map the C60 fullerenes with Ih symmetry

in a two-dimensional spinning sphere (about the z-axis) with topological defects, using a

Katanaev-Volovich theory of a continuous media [8]. Speciﬁcally we describe the matter

contents of the molecule like a homogeneous G¨odel-type metric with spherical symmetry

[32, 35–37].

Thus we use the description of the molecule in a non-inertial reference frame, by means

of a geometric approach of defects. Thus,in the neighborhood of the defects, a mixture of

the K± Fermi points occurs, and a generation of a non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld, described for a

t’Hooft-Polyakov monopole, takes place [44, 45]. So, we assume all 12 conical singularities

of the molecule to be described by a G¨odel-type metric. All this accords with the Osipov-

Kolesnikov model [63], where eigenfunctions of the quasiparticles for small quantum levels

do not oscillate too rapidly with distance. Also, we assume that our description works well

in causal regions within the set of solutions l2 < 0 thereby avoiding an imaginary vorticity

Ω2 < 0.

Finally, our contribution naturally leads to additional terms in energy levels of the quasi-

particles and current persists observed in the molecule that depends on rotation Ω. As well

as, when compared with the diﬀerent approaches about inertial frames [24, 63, 68, 69], the

limits are well recovered. Also, in the slow rotation limit for the molecule (Ω << 1), we

obtain the results found in the references [26–28]. So, we conclude that the results found in

this contribution, reveal the non-inertial eﬀects in eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of energy,

and persistent currents, for any general values of rotation about z-axis for the C60 fullerene.

Appendix: G¨odel Solution

It is well known that Einstein’s general relativity predicts several interesting phenomena,

ranging from the classical time dilatation and contraction of space, to the curvature of space

around heavy objects, such as the sun, a black hole, and most recently, the gravitational

waves detected in recent months [72].

In the 80s, three works [35–37] examined in more detail the problem of causality in the

Godel-type solutions in Einstein ﬁeld equations. In all, it is possible to distinguish three

diﬀerent classes of solutions when we study the problem in cylindrical coordinates:

ds2 = −[dt + H(r)dφ]2 + D2(r)dφ2 + dr2 + dz2.

(A.1)

Wherein H(r) = Ω

Ω = H ′

l2 sinh2(lr), and D(r) = 1
2l sinh(2lr), where Ω and l are real constants. Also
4D are necessary conditions [38] for the homogeneity of space-time. Also
[35–37] show that these conditions are not only necessary, but are suﬃcient for homogeneity

2D and l2 = D′′

since there are at least ﬁve linearly independent Killing vectors. The presence of CTCs is
related to the behaviour of the function: G(r) = D2(r) − H 2(r). So, if G(r) is negative in
a given limited region, this region will have CTCs. We have three possibilities: (i) there are
no CTCs, or l2 ≥ Ω2, (ii) there is an inﬁnite sequence of alternating causal and non-causal
regions, or l2 < 0, and (iii) there is only one non-causal region, or 0 ≤ l2 < Ω2.

One can also deﬁne three classes of solutions in metric as the symmetry of space-time

with surfaces of constant curvature: (i) ﬂat solutions, or rotation cosmic string, when l2 = 0,

(ii) solutions with positive spherical curvature when l2 < 0, (iii) and hyperbolic solutions

when l2 > 0. Diﬀerent aspects of the G¨odel solutions are discussed also in [39–43].
