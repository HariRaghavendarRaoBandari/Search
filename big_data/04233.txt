Abstract

We consider a one-dimensional version of a model obtained in [6] and describing the anisotropic
spread of tumor cells in a tissue network. The model consists of a reaction-diﬀusion-taxis equation
for the density of tumor cells coupled with an ODE for the density of tissue ﬁbers and allows for
strong degeneracy both in the diﬀusion and the haptotaxis terms.
In this setting we prove the
global existence of weak solutions to an associated no-ﬂux initial-boundary value problem.

Key words: haptotaxis; degenerate diﬀusion; global existence

Introduction

Models with degenerate diﬀusion in the context of taxis equations have received increased interest
during the last decade. They describe the dynamics of a cell population in response to a chemoat-
tractant [4, 9, 14], moving up the gradient of an insoluble signal (haptotaxis) [17], or performing both
chemo- and haptotaxis [10, 13, 16].
In this work we consider a reaction-diﬀusion-transport-haptotaxis model which is inspired by the
eﬀective equations obtained in [6] via parabolic scaling upon starting from a multiscale model for
glioma invasion in the anisotropic brain tissue and relying on the setting introduced in [5]. More
precisely, the following PDE-ODE model was considered for the density function p(t, x, v, y) of glioma
cells depending on time t, position x ∈ Rn, velocity v ∈ V := sSn−1, and density y ∈ Y := (0, R0)
of cell surface receptors1 bound to tissue ﬁbers, and for the subcellular dynamics simpliﬁed to mass
action kinetics of the mentioned receptor binding:

∂tp + ∇x · (vp) + ∇y · (G(y, w)p) = L[λ]p + P(p)

˙y = G(y, w).

(1.1)

(1.2)

Thereby, w(x) represents the (macroscopic) volume fraction of tissue, the turning operator L[λ]p :=

−λ(y)p +RV λ(y)K(x, v, v′)p(v′)dv′ describes the reorientation of cells due to contact guidance by

1R0 denotes the total amount of receptors, assumed to be constant

to cell-tissue interactions. The function λ(y) denotes the cell reorientation rate, K(x, v, v′) is the
turning kernel depending on the directional distribution q(x, v) of tissue ﬁbers (obtained from diﬀusion
tensor imaging data), µ represents the proliferation rate depending on the macroscopic cell density

tissue, and the term P(p) := µ(x, ¯p, v)RY χ(x, y, y′)p(t, x, v, y′)w(x)dy′ models proliferation subsequent
¯p =RV RY p(t, x, v, y)dydv, and χ is a kernel characterizing the transition from the state y to the state

y′ during a proliferative action.
An appropriate parabolic scaling led to the macroscopic equation for (an approximation of) the tumor
cell density:

∂tu − ∇∇ : (DT u) + ∇ · (a(w)DT ∇w u) = wµ(x, u)u,

(1.3)

where a(w) is a function containing both macroscopic and subcellular level information,

of brain tissue, and

DT = constRV qv ⊗ vdv is the tumor diﬀusion tensor encrypting the medical data about the structure
with the drift velocity ζ(x) = constRV v⊗ v∇qdv. For more details and the precise deﬁnitions we refer

∇∇ : (DT u) = ∇ · (DT (x)∇u) + ∇ · (ζ(x)u)

(1.4)

to [6].

Equation (1.3) is of the reaction-diﬀusion-transport-(hapto)taxis type and characterizes the evolution
of the tumor cell density for a known underlying structure of brain tissue; in practice, the functions q
and w are assessed at a certain time point t from medical data. This facilitates both its mathematical
analysis and eﬃcient numerical handling, however in fact the tumor evolution in a patient also induces
dynamical changes in the tissue such as e.g. depletion or remodeling, which play an essential role in
the disease development, see e.g.
[2, 12] and the references therein. Therefore, a further equation is
needed to describe these tissue modiﬁcations under the inﬂuence of tumor cells. Although in practice
it is not feasible from the viewpoint of medical imaging to assess the tissue structure dynamically,
by way of model-based predictions relying on such PDE-ODE coupled systems it is possible to use a
sequence of just a few images in order to obtain via numerical simulations a good approximation of
the dynamics over the whole timespan of interest.

Another issue is related to possible (local) degeneracies of the tumor diﬀusion tensor DT (x), which is
particularly relevant e.g. when modeling resected or irradiated regions of the tumor, where the tissue
has been depleted as well.
In the respective domains, this indeed reduces the otherwise diﬀusion-
dominated PDE (1.3) to a hyperbolic transport equation with nonlinear source term. The mathema-
tically quite delicate features of such strongly degenerate systems become manifest already in the case
when any taxis or source terms are absent, that is, when a ≡ 0 and µ ≡ 0 in (1.3). Indeed, in [7] the
linear scalar parabolic equation

∂tu = (d1(y)u)xx + (d2(y)u)yy,

(x, y) ∈ Ω = (0, Lx) × (0, Ly), t > 0,

(1.5)

has been studied, motivated among others by a monoscale model for anisotropic glioma spread in [11],
and it was shown there that if the functions d1 and d2 are smooth and nonnegative and such that d1
is strictly positive but d2 vanishes precisely in some subinterval [a, b] of (0, Ly), then solutions to an
associated no-ﬂux initial-boundary value problem asymptotically approach a singular state reﬂecting
concentration of mass within the degeneracy region [0, Lx] × [a, b] and extinction outside.
In this paper we intend to provide a ﬁrst step toward a mathematical understanding of corresponding

2

sytstems when beyond such strongly degenerate diﬀusion processes, further crucial mechanisms and
especially nonlinear haptotaxis are involved. In order to concentrate on essential aspects of such types
of interplay within the framework of a model that captures the essential properties but beyond that
remains as simple as possible, we may restrict to the spatially one-dimensional case, in which the
tumor diﬀusion tensor DT in (1.3) actually reduces to a scalar function. In the context of a simple
evolution law for the haptotactic attractant, particularly neglecting remodeling mechanisms, this leads
to coupled parabolic-ODE systems of the form

( ut =(cid:0)d(x)u(cid:1)xx −(cid:0)d(x)uψ(v)vx(cid:1)x,

vt = −uh(v),

(1.6)

with given nonnegative functions d, ψ and h.

Although in our current 1D setting (1.6) the model in [6] loses most of its anisotropy relevance, some
of it is retained in the space-dependent diﬀusion and haptotactic sensitivity coeﬃcients. Likewise,
the multiscality considered in [6] and leading to a haptotactic coeﬃcient depending on the subcellular
dynamics can still be partially retained in this model, in spite of the modiﬁed transport term, in which
the drift velocity has now a simpler form, yet depending on d(x). The very presence of the haptotaxis
term is a consequence of taking the receptor binding dynamics into account when describing the
evolution of the cell density function on the mesoscopic level and scaling up to the macroscopic one.
Hence, essential features of the model obtained in [6] are preserved even in this simpliﬁed, dimension-
reduced setting.

Another related model featuring degenerate diﬀusion in the context of haptotaxis was proposed and
investigated in [17]. The kind of degeneracy considered there is, however, diﬀerent from the one in this
and previous models, as it aﬀects both the diﬀusion and the haptotaxis coeﬃcients, thereby allowing
the diﬀusion to degenerate due to one or both solution components (tumor cell density and tissue
density). Unlike the present model, in [17] there is (apart from the taxis) no other transport term.

In order to make the essential mathematical aspects of (1.6)
Problem setup and main result.
more transparent, let us write (1.6) in a form involving a constant haptotacitc sensitivity, which
according to the simple ODE structure of the second equation therein can readily be achieved on
0 ψ(σ)dσ, v ≥ 0. Accordingly, in an open bounded interval

substituting w = Ψ(v) with Ψ(v) := R v

Ω ⊂ R we will henceforth consider the initial-boundary value problem

ut = (d(x)u)xx − (d(x)uwx)x + uf (x, u, w),
wt = −ug(w),
(d(x)u)x − d(x)uwx = 0,
u(x, 0) = u0(x), w(x, 0) = w0(x),

x ∈ Ω, t > 0,
x ∈ Ω, t > 0,
x ∈ ∂Ω, t > 0,
x ∈ Ω,

(1.7)

with given parameter functions d : ¯Ω → [0,∞), f : ¯Ω × [0,∞)2 → R and g : [0,∞) → [0,∞) satisfying
(1.8)

f ∈ C 1( ¯Ω × [0,∞)2) and g ∈ C 1([0,∞)),

and with prescribed initial data u0 and w0 which are such that

g(w0) < ∞.

(1.9)

As for the parameter functions in (1.7), throughout our analysis we shall furthermore assume that
for all (x, u, w) ∈ ¯Ω × [0,∞)2 with some nondecreasing ρ : [0,∞) → [0,∞),

f (x, u, w) ≤ ρ(w)

(1.10)

and that there exists δ > 0 such that writing

M := kw0kL∞(Ω) + δ,

(1.11)

we have

g(0) = 0,

g(w) > 0 for all w ∈ (0, M ]

and

g′(w) > 0

for all w ∈ [0, M ]

(1.12)

as well as

Beyond the analytically simplest case obtained on letting

upon which via the substitution w = v

(1.16)

of (1.6), as proposed in [17] for modeling tumor invasion in a tissue network, thereby paying increased
attention to the form of the haptotaxis coeﬃcient. Speciﬁcally, the latter accounts for microscopic
cell-tissue interactions, which –besides having a haptotaxis term at all– retains a supplementary trace
of multiscality in our macroscopic model, although in a rather indirect way, as we do not explicitly
couple some ODE for receptor binding kinetics to the two PDEs for u and v. The presence of d(x) in
both diﬀusion/transport and haptotaxis coeﬃcients is motivated by the deduction in [6].

The main results of our analysis indicate that even in this general setting, thus allowing for virtually
arbitrary strength of degeneracies in diﬀusion, haptotactic cross-diﬀusion does not result in a ﬁnite-
time collapse of solutions into e.g. persistent Dirac-type singularities. More precisely, let us introduce

the following solution concept to pursued below, in which we use the abbreviation {d > 0} :=(cid:8)x ∈
¯Ω(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) d(x) > 0(cid:9) which along with a corresponding deﬁnition of {d = 0} will frequently be used throughout

the sequel.

Within this framework, a global solution of (1.7) can always be constructed:

Theorem 1.2 Suppose that Ω ⊂ R is a bounded interval, and that u0, w0, d, f and g satisfy (1.9),
(1.8), (1.10) and (1.12). Then (1.7) possesses at least one global weak solution in the sense speciﬁed
in Deﬁnition 1.1 below.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce a regularized version of the degenerate
problem, for which some useful properties are obtained. Section 3 is concerned with studying an
entropy functional which allows to deduce a quasi-dissipative property of the regularized system, inter
alia asserting global existence of its solution. Some precompactness and regularity properties of terms
involved in that system follow in Sections 4 and 5, respectively, succeeded in Section 6 by regularity
features of corresponding time derivatives. Sections 7 and 8 provide convergence properties of the
approximate solution in the region with no degeneracy; further properties of the respective limits are
obtained in Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes the existence proof for the strongly degenerate
problem (1.7).

2 Regularized problems and their basic properties

In order to prepare the construction of an appropriate family of non-degenerate approximations of

(1.7), according to the nonnegativity of d and the inclusion √d ∈ W 1,∞(Ω) we may ﬁrst choose
(dε)ε∈(0,1) ⊂ C 3( ¯Ω) in such a way that dεx = 0 on ∂Ω and that with some K1 > 0, for each ε ∈ (0, 1)
we have
(2.1)

√ε ≤ dε(x) ≤ kdkL∞(Ω) + 1

for all x ∈ ¯Ω,

as well as

and such that moreover

and

d2
εx(x)
dε(x) ≤ K1

for all x ∈ ¯Ω,

dε → d in L∞(Ω)

as ε ց 0

(2.2)

(2.3)

a.e. in Ω

dεx → dx

(2.4)
We next note that according to (1.12) it is possible to ﬁx ε0 ∈ (0, 1) such that g(M ) > ε0, whereupon
with δ as introduced in the course of the deﬁnition (1.11) of M , for each ε ∈ (0, ε0) we can choose
δε ∈ (0, δ2) such that
(2.5)
and such that moreover δε → 0 as ε ց 0. It is then easy to see that one can ﬁnd (ηε)ε∈(0,ε0) ⊂ (0, 1)
with the two properties that

for all w ∈ [δε, M ],

g(w) ≥ ε

as ε ց 0.

with some suitably large A > 0. For ε ∈ (0, ε0), we then let

uεx = wεx = 0,
uε(x, 0) = u0(x),



Due to the additionally introduced artiﬁcial diﬀusion in the equation for wε each of these problems
can be viewed as a variant of the well-studied Keller-Segel chemotaxis system; in fact, as can be seen
by straightforward adaptation of arguments well-established in the analysis of chemotaxis problems
([1], [8], [15]), all these problems allow for local-in-time classical solutions which enjoy a favorable
extensibility criterion:

6

Lemma 2.1 For each ε ∈ (0, ε0), there exist Tmax,ε ∈ (0,∞] and nonnegative functions

which solve (2.9) in the classical sense in Ω × (0, Tmax,ε), and which are such that
if Tmax,ε < ∞, then lim sup

( uε ∈ C 0( ¯Ω × [0, Tmax,ε)) ∩ C 2,1( ¯Ω × (0, Tmax,ε)),
wε ∈ C 0([0, Tmax,ε); W 1,2(Ω)) ∩ C 2,1( ¯Ω × (0, Tmax,ε)),

g(wε(·, t))(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(Ω)(cid:19) = ∞. (2.10)

Let us ﬁrst collect some basic properties of these solutions. We ﬁrst assert some useful pointwise upper
and lower bounds for wε.
Lemma 2.2 Let ε ∈ (0, ε0). Then

wε(x, t) ≤ M

for all x ∈ Ω and t ∈ (0, Tmax,ε)

where Γ > 0 is as in (1.14).

Proof.

Since according to our choices of δε and M we have

wε(x, 0) = w0(x) +pδε ≤ kw0kL∞(Ω) + δ = M

for all x ∈ Ω,

the inequality in (2.11) immediately results from the maximum principle applied to the second equation
in (2.9). As a consequence thereof, in view of (1.12) we know that g′(wε) ≥ 0 in Ω×(0, Tmax,ε), whence

g(wε) ≤

Implications of an entropy-like structure

Now the core of our approach consists in the detection of a favorable quasi-dissipative property of the
system (2.9) which can be revealed by following the well-established strategy of considering the time
evolution of a functional that combines a logarithmic entropy of the cell distribution with a properly
chosen summand annihilating the correspondingly obtained cross-diﬀusive interaction integral.
In
order to clarify which precise form the latter takes in the context of the approximate problems (2.9),
let us begin by separately tracking the logarithmic entropy.

In fact, combining the latter two lemmata yields a quasi-entropy inequality, the essential implications
of which can be summarized as follows.

Lemma 3.3 Let T > 0. Then there exist ε⋆(T ) ∈ (0, ε0) and C(T ) > 0 such that for any choice of

with c3 := |Ω|e · (c2 + ρ(M )).
Next, the rightmost summand in (3.14) can be estimated using Lemma 2.2 along with the deﬁning
properties of (dε)ε∈(0,ε0) and (ηε)ε∈(0,ε0): Indeed, given T > 0 we may use (2.6) to ﬁx ε⋆ = ε⋆(T ) ∈
(0, ε0) small enough such that with Γ as in (1.14) we have

for all t ∈ (0, Tmax,ε)
(3.20)

for all x ∈ Ω and t ∈ (0,bTε),

for all t ∈ (0,bTε),
because dε ≥ √ε in Ω by (2.1). Together with (3.20) and (3.14), this shows that

Once more in view of (3.17), this entails both (3.9) and (3.10) with some suitably large C(T ) > 0,

Due to the boundedness property (2.11) of wε, (1.12) and (1.15), from (3.10) and (3.13) we particularly
obtain corresponding estimates for integrals no longer containing

Corollary 3.4 Suppose that T > 0, and let ε⋆(T ) ∈ (0, ε0) be as given by Lemma 3.3. Then there

(3.25) from (3.10). As furthermore (1.15) warrants that

Since g(wε) ≤ g(M ) in Ω × (0, Tmax,ε) by Lemma 2.2 and (1.12), we immediately obtain

g′(wε)
g(wε) ≥ γ > 0

in Ω × (0, Tmax,ε)

by Lemma 2.2, we also infer from (3.13) that (3.26) is valid with some adequately large C(T ) > 0. (cid:3)

As one consequence of (3.25) when combined with the boundedness of
positivity of dε, we can infer that in fact our approximate solutions cannot blow up in ﬁnite time:

(1+ηεuε)2 and the uniform

uε

Lemma 3.5 For each ε ∈ (0, ε0), the solution of (2.9) is global in time; that is, in Lemma 2.1 we
have Tmax,ε = ∞.
Proof. Assuming on the contrary that Tmax,ε be ﬁnite, combining (2.12) with (1.12) we ﬁrst obtain
that then there would exist c1 > 0 such that

1

g(wε) ≤ c1

in Ω × (0, Tmax,ε).

Moreover, as dε > 0 in ¯Ω by (2.1), Corollary 3.4 and Lemma 2.2 would yield c2 > 0 fulﬁlling

kwε(·, t)kW 1,2(Ω) ≤ c2

for all t ∈ (0, Tmax,ε).

(3.27)

In particular, the latter along with (2.1) and the fact that
cross-diﬀusive ﬂux in the ﬁrst equation in (2.9) satisﬁes

(1+ηεξ)2 ≤ 1

for all ξ ≥ 0 ensures that the

a standard argument based on the smoothing properties of the non-degenerate linear semigroup
(et(dε·)xx)t≥0 (cf. e.g. the reasoning in [3, Lemma 3.2]) provides c3 > 0 such that

kuε(·, t)kL∞(Ω) ≤ c3

for all t ∈ (0, Tmax,ε).

In view of the extensibility criterion (2.10), together with (3.27) and (3.28) this shows that our as-
sumption Tmax,ε < ∞ was absurd.

4 Weak precompactness properties of uεf (x, uε, wε) and uεg(wε) in L1

In appropriately passing to the limit in the zero-order integrals appearing in the respective weak
formulations of (2.9), we shall make essential use of two compactness properties of the solutions
thereof which appear to go beyond trivial implications of the bounds provided by Lemma 3.3. As a
preparation for our arguments in this respect, let us state the following observation on a lower bound
for all possible values of u ≥ 0 at which u·f−(x, u, w) may become large for some x ∈ ¯Ω and w ∈ [0, M ].
This will be used in Lemma 4.2 to assert that for arbitrarily large κ > 0 one can pick N > 0 in such
a way that whenever uεf−(·uε, wε) ≥ N , we know that uε ≥ κ.
Lemma 4.1 With M > 0 as in (1.11), let

S(N ) :=nu ≥ 0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) u · f−(x, u, w) ≥ N for some x ∈ ¯Ω and w ∈ [0, M ]o

and

κ(N ) :=( inf S(N )

+∞

if S(N ) 6= ∅,
else

for N ∈ N. Then

lim sup
N→∞

κ(N ) = +∞.

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

If (4.3) was false, then there would exist N0 ∈ N such that for all N ≥ N0 we would have
Proof.
S(N ) 6= ∅ and κ(N ) < c1 with some c1 > 0. By deﬁnition of S(N ) and κ(N ), this would mean that
we could ﬁnd (xN )N≥N0 ⊂ ¯Ω, (uN )N≥N0 ⊂ [0,∞) and (wN )N≥N0 ⊂ [0, M ] fulﬁlling

uN · f−(xN , uN , wN ) ≥ N

for all N ≥ N0

(4.4)

and

uN ≤ c1

for all N ≥ N0,

where passing to a subsequence if necessary we may assume that as N → ∞ we have xN → x∞,
uN → u∞ and wN → w∞ with some x∞ ∈ ¯Ω, u∞ ∈ [0, c1] and w∞ ∈ [0, M ]. By continuity of f−,
however, this would imply that

uN · f−(xN , uN , wN ) → u∞ · f−(x∞, u∞, w∞)

as N → ∞

and thereby contradict (4.4).

(cid:3)

Making use of the latter, by means of the Dunford-Pettis theorem we can now establish suitable
compactness properties of the rightmost summands in the ﬁrst two equations in (2.9).
Lemma 4.2 Let T > 0. Then with ε⋆(T ) ∈ (0, ε0) as in Lemma 3.3,

is relatively compact with respect to the weak topology in L1(Ω × (0, T )),
(4.5)

(cid:16)uεg(wε)(cid:17)ε∈(0,ε⋆(T ))

and moreover

is relatively compact with respect to the weak topology in L1(Ω × (0, T )). (4.6)

necessarily must have uε(x, t) ≥ κ(N ). Consequently, E ∩ {uεf−(·uε, wε) ≥ N} ⊂ E ∩ {uε ≥ κ(N )},

5 Regularity properties of √dεuε

In order to further prepare our limit procedure, especially with regard to pointwise convergence of uε
(1+ηεuε)2 wεx in (2.9), we next plan to combine
and of convergence in the cross-diﬀusive ﬂux term dε
the weak compactness feature of the part √dεwεx thereof, as naturally implied by Corollary 3.4,
by an appropriate result on convergence in the complementary factor √dε
(1+ηεuε)2 in a strong L2
topology. To achieve this in Lemma 8.1 by using underway an argument based on the Aubin-Lions
lemma, let us suitably interpolate between the inequalities in (2.14) and (3.11) to derive the following
spatio-temporal estimates for the quantity √dεuε forming the core of the factor in question.

6 Regularity in time

As a ﬁnal preparation for our ﬁrst subsequence extraction procedure, we combine our previously gained
estimates to obtain some regularity properties involving time derivatives of the solution components
uε and wε.

Lemma 6.1 Let T > 0 and ε⋆(T ) ∈ (0, ε0) be as in Lemma 3.3. Then there exists C(T ) > 0 such
that

dt ≤ C(T )

for all ε ∈ (0, ε⋆(T )).

L2(Ω) ⊂ L
5 (Ω), in view of the estimates implied by Lemma 3.3, Corollary 3.4, Lemma 5.1, Lemma
2.3 and Lemma 4.2 we only need to collect (6.3), (6.4) and (6.6)-(6.13) to derive (6.1) from (6.2). (cid:3)

It may be not surprising that our derivation of a corresponding property of wε is much less involved:
Lemma 6.2 Let T > 0, and let ε⋆(T ) ∈ (0, ε0) be as in Lemma 3.3. Then one can ﬁnd C(T ) > 0
such that

7 Construction of limit functions in {d > 0}

We are now prepared for the construction of a limit function inside the positivity set of d through
a straightforward extraction process based on straighforward compactness arguments. We remark
that at this stage, besides the weighted functions √dεwε, our reasoning yet involves the quantities
pdε(uε + 1), rather than those addressed in Lemma 5.1.

Lemma 7.1 There exist a sequence (εk)k∈N ⊂ (0, ε0) and nonnegative functions eu and ew deﬁned in

{d > 0} × (0,∞) such that εk ց 0 as k → ∞ and

for all ε ∈ (0, ε0), it follows from Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 2.3 that with ε⋆(T ) as introduced there,

is bounded in L2((0, T ); W 1,2(Ω)).

Therefore, in view of Lemma 6.1 the Aubin-Lions lemma asserts that for any such T ,

is relatively compact in L2((0, T ); L2(Ω)),

the weak topology in L1(Ω× (0, T )), and that hence (7.2) can be achieved on extracting a subsequence

(7.9)

whereas (7.8) in conjunction with Lemma 6.2 and the Aubin-Lions lemma ensures that

(cid:16)pdεwε(cid:17)ε∈(0,ε⋆(T ))

We are now ready to make sure that (eu,ew) indeed solves (1.7) when restricted to {d > 0} in the

Next, since Lemma 7.1 warrants that also uε →eu and wε → ew a.e. in {d > 0}× (0,∞) as ε = εk ց 0,
it follows from Lemma 4.2 and a standard argument, again involving Egorov’s theorem, that

10 Proof of Theorem 1.2

We can ﬁnally extend the above spatially local solution in an evident manner so as to become a global
weak solution in the ﬂavor of Deﬁnition 1.1. In the veriﬁcation of the desired solution property near the

boundary of {d > 0} we shall make use of the following consequence of the inclusion √d ∈ W 1,∞(Ω).
Lemma 10.1 Let x ∈ ¯Ω. Then

d(x) ≤

K1

(10.1)

Proof. We only need to consider the case when d(x) > 0, in which by the closedness of {d = 0}
we can pick x0 ∈ ¯Ω such that d(x0) = 0 and |x − x0| = dist (x,{d = 0}) > 0. Thanks to (2.2), we then
have

extension of (eu,ew), consisting of a solution to the ODE system formally associated with (1.7) in
Proof of Theorem 1.2. We let eu and ew denote the functions deﬁned on {d > 0} × (0,∞) in
Lemma 7.1, and for ﬁxed x ∈ {d = 0} we let (bu(x,·),bw(x,·)) ∈ (C 1([0,∞)))2 be the solution of the

initial-value problem

t > 0,

(10.2)

Indeed, it follows from (1.8), (1.10) and (1.12) that for any such x this ODE problem possesses a
globally deﬁned solution fulﬁlling

bw(x, 0) = w0(x).

deﬁnes a pair of nonnegative measurable functions on all of Ω × (0,∞) which thanks to Lemma 7.1,
Lemma 4.2, Lemma 2.2, (1.12), (10.3) and (10.4) satisfy (1.17) and (1.18), and for which Lemma 8.2
in particular entails that also (1.19) holds.
In order to verify (1.20), we ﬁrst make use of the fact that by continuity of d the set {d > 0} is
relatively open in ¯Ω, and hence consists of countably many connected components; that is, there exist

an index set I ⊂ N and intervals Pi ⊂ ¯Ω, i ∈ I, such that {d > 0} =Si∈I Pi and Pi∩ Pj = ∅ for i, j ∈ I
with i 6= j. Now for each i ∈ I, there exist ai ∈ ¯Ω and bi ∈ ¯Ω such that (ai, bi) ⊂ Pi ⊂ [ai, bi], where
ai ∈ Pi if and only if ai ∈ ∂Ω and bi ∈ Pi if and only if bi ∈ ∂Ω. For ﬁxed δ ∈ (0, 1), deﬁning δi := 2−iδ,
i ∈ I, it is then possible to pick (ζ (i)
δ ≤ 1 in ¯Ω,
δ (x) = 1 whenever x ∈ Pi is such that dist (x, ∂Pi) ≥ δi, ζ (i)

δ ≡ 1 holds even throughout
[ai, bi − δi], and where, similarly, in the case bi ∈ ∂Ω we require that ζ (i)
δ ≡ 1 in [ai + δi, bi].
Now given ϕ ∈ C∞0 ( ¯Ω×[0,∞)) satisfying ϕx = 0 on ∂Ω×(0,∞), from (10.2) and (10.4) we immediately
see that

is such that ζδx(x) 6= 0, for some i ∈ I we have x ∈ Pi and dist (x,{d = 0}) ≤ δi and hence

as δ ց 0, from (10.9)-(10.14), (10.20) and (10.21) we conclude that

which in combination with (10.8) shows that indeed (1.20) is valid for any such ϕ.
The derivation of (1.21) is much less involved: Given ϕ ∈ C∞0 (Ω × [0,∞)), from (10.5) and (10.2) we
ﬁrst obtain that

for all δ ∈ (0, 1). Using that w and ug(w) belong to L1
4.2 and Lemma 7.1, we may again employ the dominated convergence theorem here to see that in the
limit δ ց 0, (10.23) implies that

and that thus in view of (10.22) also (1.21) holds.
