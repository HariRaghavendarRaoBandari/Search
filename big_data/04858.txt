ABSTRACT
We present an analysis of the iron abundance in the hot gas surrounding galaxy groups
and clusters. To do this, we ﬁrst compile and homogenise a large dataset of 79 low-
redshift (|z| = 0.03) systems (159 individual measurements) from the literature. Our
analysis accounts for diﬀerences in aperture size, solar abundance, and cosmology, and
scales all measurements using customised radial proﬁles for the temperature (T ), gas
density (ρgas), and iron abundance (ZFe). We then compare this dataset to groups and
clusters in the L-Galaxies galaxy evolution model.

Our homogenised dataset reveals a tight T -ZFe relation for clusters, with a scatter
in ZFe of only 0.10 dex and a slight negative gradient. After examining potential
measurement biases, we conclude that at least some of this negative gradient has
a physical origin. Our model suggests greater accretion of hydrogen in the hottest
systems, via stripping of gas from infalling satellites, as a cause. At lower temperatures,
L-Galaxies over-estimates ZFe in groups, indicating that metal-rich gas removal (via
e.g. AGN feedback) is required.

L-Galaxies provides a reasonable match to the observed ZFe in the intracluster
medium (ICM) of the hottest clusters from at least z ∼ 1.3 to 0.3. This is achieved
without needing to modify any of the galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model pa-
rameters. However, the ZFe in intermediate-T clusters appears to be under-estimated
in our model at z = 0. The merits and problems with modifying the GCE modelling
to correct this are discussed.

Key words: Galaxies: abundances – Galaxies: clusters: general – Methods: analytical

INTRODUCTION

1
Galaxy clusters have long been known to host large reser-
voirs of hot gas (Mitchell et al. 1976). This intracluster
medium (ICM) is a mix of accreted pristine gas and en-
riched material that has been processed through stars and
driven out of the member galaxies via supernovæ, stellar
winds, stripping processes, and feedback from active galac-
tic nuclei (AGN). The same is true of galaxy groups, which
contain less hot gas than clusters but are much more numer-
ous. Studying the chemical evolution of the ICM therefore
provides distinct insights into three of the most fundamen-
tal questions in galaxy evolution – what comes in, what goes
out, and when does this infall and outﬂow occur?

Observational studies of emission lines in the X-ray
spectra of nearby clusters have found that the local ICM is
enriched with iron to around one third of the solar abun-
dance (e.g. Edge & Stewart 1991; Fukazawa et al. 1998;
De Grandi & Molendi 2001; Tamura et al. 2004). There is
also some indication that this enrichment was largely
complete by z ∼ 1 (e.g. Mushotzky & Loewenstein 1997;
Allen & Fabian 1998; Tozzi et al. 2003; Anderson et al.
2009; Baldi et al. 2012), and similar conclusions can
be drawn from observations of the cool circumgalactic
medium (CGM) surrounding massive galaxies at z ∼ 2
(Prochaska et al. 2014).

The large amount of metals detected in the ICM of
nearby clusters has, however, posed a long-standing prob-
lem for galaxy evolution models. Super-solar iron yields
were required by early models in order to reproduce the ob-

2

Yates et al.

served ratio between iron mass in the ICM and B-band lumi-
nosity of the cluster galaxies (Kauﬀmann, & Charlot 1998;
De Lucia et al. 2004). More recently, the purely analytic
model presented by Renzini & Andreon (2014) also suggests
that the iron yield in the largest clusters (M500 > 1014 M⊙)
needs to be four times the solar value. And even studies
which have incorporated more sophisticated modelling of
the production and distribution of chemical elements have
found that, when assuming typical stellar yields, the ICM
iron abundance is around 0.25 dex below that observed
(Nagashima et al. 2005a; Arrigoni et al. 2010b).

From the model perspective, possible solutions to this
problem have included changes to the shape of the stel-
lar initial mass function (IMF), increases in the eﬃciency
of iron production in SNe-Ia, more eﬃcient metal ejec-
tion from galaxies, and including pair-instability supernovæ
(e.g. Moretti, Portinari & Chiosi
2003; Nagashima et al.
2005a; Bower, McCarthy & Benson 2008; Fabjan et al.
2010; Arrigoni et al. 2010b; Short, Thomas & Young 2013;
Morsony et al. 2014). However, such changes also have a sig-
niﬁcant impact on the chemical compositions of the galaxies
within clusters and in lower-density environments (§6.3 and
Arrigoni et al. 2010b).

In this work, our interest in ICM enrichment is twofold:
Firstly, we wish to obtain a large, homogenised dataset of
iron abundance (ZFe) measurements for local groups and
clusters. The correlation between ZFe and the ICM tem-
perature (T ) can then be studied in unprecedented detail.
Secondly, we will use this dataset to test the Munich semi-
analytic model of galaxy evolution, L-Galaxies. We wish
to determine if our model can reproduce the key trends ob-
served in the ICM without compromising its good agree-
ment with the chemical composition of other astrophysical
regions.

This paper is structured as follows: In §2, we outline
our observational dataset, the classiﬁcations we adopt and
our methods for homogenising measurements of ICM tem-
perature and iron abundance. The ten observational sam-
ples we utilise are discussed individually in Appendix A.
In §3, we show the T -ZFe relation for our homogenised
dataset of nearby groups and clusters, and discuss the re-
vealed trends in detail. In §4, we describe the core version of
the L-Galaxies galaxy evolution model. In §5, we outline
our model sample of groups and clusters, and present how
their properties are scaled to match those observations to
which we compare. In §6, we discuss how L-Galaxies per-
forms when compared to observations of the baryon fraction
in clusters, the T -ZFe relation and the evolution of ZFe with
redshift. In §7, we provide a summary of our results and
our conclusions. Where the model is able to reproduce the
data, we investigate the physical mechanisms modelled that
have lead to these results. Where the model fails, we discuss
possible ways to improve the agreement.

Throughout this work, the logarithm of x to the base

ten is written simply as log(x).

2 OBSERVATIONAL SAMPLE

Here, we outline how systems from our observational dataset
are classiﬁed, and how key properties are calculated. The

10 observational samples that we consider, along with the
acronyms we adopt for them hereafter, are listed in Table 1.
Diﬀerent methods have been required when processing
diﬀerent samples, depending on the speciﬁcs of the survey
from which they were obtained. However, the following clas-
siﬁcations are always applied where possible. Any departures
from this set of deﬁnitions for speciﬁc systems are detailed
in Appendix A.

2.1 Deﬁnitions

• Groups and clusters: We choose to distinguish between
galaxy groups and clusters by their ICM temperature, with
a threshold value of log(kT500/keV) = 0.1 (or kT500 = 1.26
keV), where T500 is the temperature at r500. This corre-
sponds to a mean, emission-weighted, ICM temperature of
k ¯T500,ew ∼ 1.9 keV. We acknowledge that this is an overly
simplistic deﬁnition, but note that our choice is similar to
the value of k ¯T500,ew = 2.0 keV chosen by previous authors
for their studies of groups and clusters (e.g. Mulchaey et al.
2003 and Mahdavi et al. 2005).

• Cool and non-cool cores: We further classify all ob-
jects as exhibiting either a cool-core (CC) or a non-cool-
core (NCC). It should be noted that the groups and clusters
in our dataset actually form a continuous distribution of
systems, with mass deposition rates ( ˙Mdep) ranging from 0
to ∼ 1000 M⊙/yr (see e.g. Peres et al. 1998, ﬁg. 7) and tem-
perature gradients ranging from steeply negative to positive.
Nonetheless, some distinction between CC and NCC systems
is required, as they are known to have distinct properties
which inﬂuence our estimation of the iron abundance.

Therefore, we match clusters to the Hudson et al. (2012,
table 3) catalogue of CC and NCC systems where possi-
ble. Their classiﬁcation is based on measurements of the
central cooling time (CCT), where clusters with CCT >
7.59 h−1/2
73 Gyr are deﬁned as being NCC. For the 17 of our
clusters not in the Hudson et al. (2010) sample, we rely on
˙Mdep measured by White, Jones & Forman (1997) or
the
Peres et al. (1998), who utilised Einstein and ROSAT data.
In these cases, all objects with ˙Mdep consistent with zero
within errors are classiﬁed as NCC.

Under this classiﬁcation scheme, 33 per cent of our sample
of 54 clusters are NCCs. This is slightly higher than the 28
per cent found by Hudson et al. (2010) for their sample. This
diﬀerence could be due to our reliance on the less-accurate
˙Mdep determination for some objects. The majority (59 per
cent) of the 17 clusters not present in the Hudson et al.
(2010) sample are designated as NCCs according to their
˙Mdep, which can be under-predicted when using Einstein
and ROSAT data.

We note that only ﬁve of our clusters have discrepant
classiﬁcations when considering ˙Mdep or CCT as the indica-
tor. All ﬁve are classiﬁed as NCC when using ˙Mdep and as
weak CCs when using CCT. With the exception of A2589,
all these clusters are known to be disturbed (i.e. merging),
so this discrepancy is likely due to these systems losing their
cool cores and becoming NCCs.

For galaxy groups, we largely rely on either the temper-
ature proﬁles measured by Rasmussen & Ponman (2007),
or the classiﬁcations of Johnson, Ponman & Finoguenov
(2009), who deﬁned CC systems as those with a mean

temperature within 0.1 − 0.3 r500 greater than that within
0.00 − 0.05 r500.

Groups or clusters that are not present in any of the
above-mentioned catalogues were determined to be CC or
NCC based on other temperature proﬁle measurements from
the literature (see Appendix A).

• Hubble parameter: Where necessary, physical properties
were corrected for diﬀerences in the assumed dimensionless
Hubble parameter, h ≡ H0/(100 km s−1 Mpc−1), rescaling
to h = 0.73 to match that assumed in our galaxy formation
model (§4). We note that h is factored-in to all numbered
quantities where necessary in this work, with the placeholder
h73 = 1 included to indicate our assumed cosmology.

• Structural parameters: For clusters, values of redshift
(z), r200, and M200 (required to obtain r500), as well as rc
and β (required to calculate the gas density proﬁle), were ex-
clusively taken from the catalogue of Reiprich & B¨ohringer
(2002), to ensure that they are calculated in a consistent
way. This means that six objects from our cluster samples
are not in our ﬁnal data set due to not being present in
the Reiprich & B¨ohringer (2002) extended catalogue. For
groups, z, rc and β were taken from the Mulchaey et al.
(2003) or Rasmussen & Ponman (2009) group catalogues
where possible, and r500 was estimated from the mean tem-
perature, as described in §2.2. For those groups where struc-
tural parameters could not be obtained from the literature,
we estimated rc and β in the same way as for our model
sample (§5).

• Solar abundances: All chemical abundances were re-
normalised to the solar photospheric abundances provided
by Grevesse & Sauval (1998). On this scale, the solar abun-
dance of iron by number is NFe,⊙/NH,⊙ = 3.16 × 10−5.
This is an important step in the homogenisation process,
as, for example, there is a 0.17 dex drop in the estimated
iron abundance when using the solar photospheric value of
NFe,⊙/NH,⊙ = 4.67 × 10−5 measured by Anders & Grevesse
(1989) rather than that of Grevesse & Sauval (1998).

2.2 Radius estimation

We choose to scale all measurements to r500, the radius
within which the matter density is 500 times that of the

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

critical density of the Universe (i.e. enclosing an over-density
of ∆500 ≡ 500). This radius is chosen to minimise the de-
gree of correction required for observational measurements,
which are typically taken between r2500 and r500.

For galaxy clusters, to ensure consistency with the way
this radius is calculated in our galaxy evolution model, r500
is obtained from published values of r200 and M200 by

r500 = a x500 ,

(1)

where a = r200/c is the scale length, and the concentration,
c, is assumed to be given by

c =(cid:18) 9.90

1 + z(cid:19)(cid:18) M200

1 × 104 h−1

73 (cid:19)−0.102

,

(2)

as found by Dolag et al. (2004) for simulated haloes in a
ΛCDM cosmology with σ8 = 0.9.

The quantity x500 is obtained assuming an NFW
dark matter (DM) density proﬁle (Navarro, Frenk & White
1997), given by

ρDM(r) =

ρ0

(r/a)(1 + r/a)2 ,

(3)

where ρ0 = ρcrit δc = (3H 2
istic density, given by

0 /8πG)δc, and δc is the character-

δc =

∆200

c3

3

ln(1 + c) − c/(1 + c)

.

(4)

We note that using the values of r500 provided
by e.g. Reiprich & B¨ohringer (2002), rather than values
rescaled from r200, makes a negligible diﬀerence to our re-
sults.

For galaxy groups, measured values of r200 and
M200 are very rare in the literature. We therefore
estimate r500
from the mean, emission-weighted tem-
perature,
following the scaling relation presented by
Finoguenov, Reiprich & B¨ohringer (2001b);

r500 = 0.432±0.007pk ¯Tew h−1

73 Mpc .

temperature proﬁles assumed for
clusters and groups, taken from Vikhlinin et al. (2006) and
Rasmussen & Ponman (2007), respectively (§2.3). The mean tem-
perature for the group proﬁle has been re-scaled in this ﬁgure to
a mass-weighted value using the spectroscopic-to-mass weighted
conversion factor of 1.11 provided by Vikhlinin et al. (2006). The
dashed line indicates an extrapolation beyond the radii in which
the Vikhlinin et al. (2006) cluster proﬁle was ﬁt.

2.3 Temperature estimation

The X-ray-emitting-gas temperature at r500 is obtained us-
ing distinct temperature proﬁles for groups and clusters.

For clusters, T500 is obtained using the typical tempera-
ture proﬁle found by Vikhlinin et al. (2006) for their systems
with kT > 2.5 keV:

T (r) = 1.35 ¯Tmw(cid:20) (x/0.045)1.9 + 0.45
(x/0.045)1.9 + 1 (cid:21)(cid:20)

(6)
where x = r/r500 and ¯Tmw is the mean, mass-weighted gas
temperature. Where necessary, measured peak or emission-
weighted temperatures are converted to mass-weighted val-
ues using the following conversion factors,

1

1 + (x/0.6)2(cid:21) ,

Tpeak : ¯Tew : ¯Tmw = 1.21 : 1.11 : 1 ,

(7)

provided by Vikhlinin et al. (2006, eqn. 9).

For groups,

the preferred temperature proﬁle of
Rasmussen & Ponman (2007, eqns. 3 and 7) for their sample
of galaxy groups is used:

T (r) = ¯Tew · x0.21±0.02 100.28±0.03

for x < 0.1

= ¯Tew [−0.51±0.04 log(x) + 0.67±0.03]

for x > 0.1 ,

(8)

where x = r/r500.

These two proﬁles are shown in Fig. 1. We can see that,
when normalised by mean mass-weighted temperature, both
provide essentially identical values of T500 ∼ 0.74 ¯Tmw.1 In-
deed, when comparing the two temperature proﬁles using
our dataset, we ﬁnd the value of T500 obtained only dif-
fers by ∼ 0.02 keV or less [as low as ∼ 0.005 keV for
objects with temperatures around the transition value of
log(kT500/keV) = 0.1]. Rasmussen & Ponman (2007) also
found a similarity between group and cluster temperature

1 We note that Eqn. 6 for clusters was ﬁt using mean temper-
atures measured between r = 69 h−1
73 kpc (∼ 0.005 - 0.01 r500)
and r500, whereas Eqn. 8 relied on mean temperatures measured
between 0.1 and 0.3 r500.

proﬁles when comparing various forms, including Eqn. 8 and
a Vikhlinin et al. (2006) proﬁle analogue.

We do not adopt diﬀerent temperature proﬁles for
CC and NCC systems, even though these two classes self-
evidently have diﬀerent core temperatures, as their tem-
perature proﬁles beyond the core (e.g. at around r500)
are found to be quite similar (e.g. Markevitch et al. 1998;
De Grandi & Molendi 2002; Leccardi & Molendi 2008). The
mean temperatures quoted should be representative of the
average ICM temperature beyond the core, and so can be
scaled appropriately for both CC and NCC systems with
our cluster proﬁle.

2.4 Iron abundance estimation

Iron abundances in this work are given as

log(ZFe) = log(cid:18) NFe

NH(cid:19) − log(cid:18) NFe,⊙

NH,⊙(cid:19) ,

(9)

where NFe is the number of iron atoms, and NFe,⊙/NH,⊙
is the iron abundance by number in the solar photosphere,
assumed here to be given by Grevesse & Sauval (1998).

In order to obtain the mass-weighted iron abun-
dance within r500 ( ¯ZFe,500) from measurements of the
emission-weighted iron abundance within some observed
aperture ( ¯ZFe,obs), assumptions need to be made about
the distribution of gas and iron within the ICM. For
the gas density proﬁle, we assume a single β model
(Cavaliere & Fusco-Fermiano 1976), given by

ρgas(r) = ρgas,0"1 +(cid:18) r

rc(cid:19)2#−3β/2

,

(10)

with the slope, β, and core radius, rc, obtained from the lit-
erature for each object individually. Although this single β
proﬁle is often assumed in theoretical studies of model clus-
ters (e.g. Nagashima et al. 2005a; Arrigoni et al. 2010b), we
caution that it is not necessarily accurate for all systems in
reality (see e.g. Mulchaey et al. 2003; Vikhlinin et al. 2006),
and is therefore only an approximation.

We also assume a β model for the iron abundance pro-
ﬁle, as chosen by De Grandi et al. (2004) for their cluster

and NCC cluster proﬁles, and data from Rasmussen & Ponman

xc(cid:19)2#−α

,

(11)

where x = r/r180 for clusters and r/r500 for groups. How-
ever, we re-calculate the parameters xc and α to ﬁt more
recent data. For clusters, we ﬁt Eqn. 11 to the binned radial
abundance data provided by M11 (their table 4) for 16 CC
clusters, and also separately for 10 NCC clusters. For groups,
we ﬁt Eqn. 11 to the binned radial abundance data provided
by Rasmussen & Ponman (2007) for 15 galaxy groups. The
ﬁtting parameters we obtain are given in Table 2, and the
three default iron abundance proﬁles are shown in Fig. 2.

Unlike the temperature proﬁles described in §2.3, these
diﬀerent iron abundance proﬁles lead to signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent estimates of the mean iron abundance. For exam-
ple, for any given object, our CC cluster proﬁle returns
a value of ¯ZFe,500 which is around 0.10 dex higher than
our group proﬁle. This is because the gradient for groups
is steeper than for clusters,
in line with the ﬁndings of
Rasmussen & Ponman (2007). More of the total iron is con-
centrated close to the centre in groups, causing the correc-
tion factor when calculating the mean iron abundance within
r500 to be larger.

We consider the choice of iron abundance proﬁle to be
one of the major sources of uncertainty in our results. In
practice, individual systems can have iron abundance pro-
ﬁles that are quite distinct from any typical proﬁle, even
within the samples from which these typical proﬁles are de-
termined.

Given these default proﬁles, we obtain ¯ZFe,500 following
a two step process: Firstly, we normalise the iron abundance
proﬁle for each system, by obtaining ZFe,0 from the observed
emission-weighted iron abundance (measured within rmin <
r < rmax):

ZFe,0 = ¯ZFe,obs

rmin

R rmax

rmin

ρ2
gas r2 dr
[1 + (x/xc)2]−α ρ2

R rmax

gas r2 dr

.

(12)

We then use this normalised proﬁle to obtain the mass-

weighted iron abundance within r500, given by

ZFe ρgas r2 dr

0

¯ZFe,500 = R r500
R r500

0

ρgas r2 dr

.

(13)

This procedure allows us to obtain scaled, mass-
weighted iron abundances for any galaxy group or cluster

with an X-ray spectrum, even if no radial information is
available. In this work, we will show how this procedure
yields ¯ZFe,500 estimates that are consistent among diﬀerent
studies of the same system (§3.3), and with alternative esti-
mates of the mass-weighted iron abundance using the same
data (§A.2.3).

3 OBSERVATIONAL RESULTS

Fig. 3 shows the kT500 - ¯ZFe,500 relation for our complete
dataset of galaxy groups and clusters. We can see that clus-
ters tend to have higher iron abundances than groups. Be-
low log(kT500/keV) ∼ 0.2, there is a systematic decrease in
ZFe with decreasing temperature. This trend is discussed in
§3.2. Above log(kT500/keV) ∼ 0.3, the T -ZFe relation for
clusters is remarkably tight and has a weak negative slope.
This trend is discussed in §3.1.

Errors on all measurements and ﬁtting parameters have
been fully propagated through to a ﬁnal error in ¯ZFe,500 in
this work. These ﬁnal errors are predominantly driven by
the uncertainty in the original iron abundance measurement,
with the exception of a few systems whose core radius, rc, is
poorly constrained by the measured surface brightness pro-
ﬁle (e.g. A2147). These systems have larger errors on ¯ZFe,500,
as the metallicity determination is particularly sensitive to
any uncertainty in rc.

The data plotted in Fig. 3 is provided in Tables 4, 5,

and 6 at the end of this work, and is available online.2

3.1 The T -ZFe relation for clusters

A linear ﬁt to the data above log(kT500/keV) = 0.25 yields
the following relation for clusters:

log( ¯ZFe,500) = (−0.26±0.03) log(kT500/keV) − (0.37±0.02)

(14)
with a 1σ dispersion in ¯ZFe,500 from residuals of 0.10 dex.
The T -ZFe relation for galaxy clusters is therefore as
tight as
the well-established M∗-ZO relation (i.e. the
mass-metallicity relation) for local, star-forming galaxies
(Tremonti et al. 2004; Yates et al. 2013).

The slight decrease in ¯ZFe,500 with increasing tempera-
ture apparent in Fig. 3 is also seen in most of the individ-
ual cluster (§A.1.7). Such an anti-correlation has already
been observed and discussed in the literature (e.g. F98;
P03; Baumgartner et al. 2005; Balestra et al. 2007; M11;
Hofmann et al. 2016), and the possibility that this is an ar-
tiﬁcial eﬀect must be assessed.

F98 suggested that a higher central concentration of
iron in lower-temperature clusters could bias abundance
measurements when observing the cores. If this were the
case, then our choice of a ﬁxed slope for the ZFe proﬁle
would be artiﬁcially increasing the estimated value of ¯ZFe,500
for lower-temperature clusters. However, we note that the
original F98 data also shows a slight anti-correlation be-
tween temperature and ZFe, even though they intention-
ally masked-out the clusters’ central regions. In fact, there

and open symbols indicate NCC systems. The grey vertical line separates groups and clusters at log(kT500/keV) = 0.1, as discussed in
§2.1. There is a strong T -ZFe correlation for groups, albeit with a large scatter, and a weak T -ZFe anti-correlation for clusters, with a
small scatter of only 0.10 dex.

is a clear anti-correlation present in the original data of
most of the cluster samples we consider here, regardless of
their choice of observed aperture. And, given that our ho-
mogenisation process actually ﬂattens the slope of this anti-
correlation slightly for all but two of the cluster samples3,
we consider it unlikely that our choice of ﬁxed slope for the
iron abundance proﬁle of CC clusters is the dominant cause
of this trend.

Alternatively, a temperature-dependent change in the
way the iron abundance is derived could be the cause. The
presence of an ‘Fe bias’ (Buote 2000a, section A.1) can
lead to an over-estimation of ZFe in cooler systems whose
spectra are dominated by the Fe L-shell line complex at
∼ 1 keV, rather than the Fe K-shell line complex at ∼ 6.5
keV. In the context of clusters, this could lead to higher
measured iron abundances for cooler CC systems, if their
bright, metal-rich cores have temperatures around 1 keV
(Nagashima et al. 2005a). However, again, the fact that a
T -ZFe anti-correlation is seen even in data which excludes
the central regions (or when considering MFe/Mgas rather
than ZFe, De Grandi et al. 2004) makes it unlikely that an
Fe bias is the primary cause here.

Finally, when analysing mock X-ray spectra of four
model galaxy clusters, Rasia et al. (2008) noted that for
their cluster in the transition region of k ¯Tew ∼ 2 − 3 keV,
neither the Fe-L lines nor the Fe-K lines dominated the
spectrum (see also Simionsecu et al. 2009). In such cases,

3 The steepness of the kT500 - ¯ZFe,500 anti-correlation for the
F98 and T04 increases after homogenisation because these studies
adopted a ﬁxed spatial aperture (in both cases, 69 − 274 h−1
73 kpc),
rather than one as a function of each object’s scale radius
(e.g. r500). If uncorrected, this leads to an over-estimation of the
average metallicity for larger, more extended clusters at low red-
shift.

both sets of line complexes contribute to the estimated iron
abundance, causing an over-estimation of the true, aver-
age ICM iron abundance of up to 20 per cent. Although
the peak in the kT500 - ¯ZFe,500 relation for our dataset
(log(kT500/keV) ∼ 0.4, or k ¯Tew ∼ 3.7 keV) is slightly above
the transition region identiﬁed by Rasia et al. (2008), this
phenomenon could still be a contributing factor to the anti-
correlation we see. However, a reduction in the iron abun-
dance at the peak in the relation by the maximum amount
predicted by Rasia et al. (2008) would still leave a resid-
ual negative correlation between T and ZFe for our cluster
dataset.

Therefore, we must consider that some of the T -ZFe
anti-correlation we observe for clusters could be physical. For
example, the decrease in iron abundance with temperature
for clusters coincides with a similar increase in their baryon
fraction (e.g. Lin, Mohr & Stanford 2003; Vikhlinin et al.
2006; Giodini et al. 2009; McGaugh et al. 2010). More ef-
ﬁcient accretion of pristine gas onto the largest DM haloes
would explain both these trends. The peak in the T -ZFe
relation at log(kT500/keV) ∼ 0.35 could therefore indicate
a ‘sweet spot’ for clusters, below which feedback processes
more eﬃciently remove metals, and above which infall pro-
cesses more eﬃciently dilute the ICM. This is discussed fur-
ther with regard to our galaxy evolution model in §6.3.

3.2 The T -ZFe relation for groups

Below log(kT500/keV) = 0.1, we can see the opposite trend
to that seen for clusters – the mean iron abundance in the
hot gas surrounding groups seems to positively correlate
with temperature. When assessing if this is a real corre-
lation, we note that the transition between these two trends
occurs at a temperature [log(kT500/keV) ∼ 0.35] that is 0.25
dex higher than our chosen transition temperature between

groups and clusters. This suggests that the diﬀerent ways
we treat groups and clusters in our homogenisation process
is not causing the reversal in the T -ZFe trend here.

A linear ﬁt

to the data in the range −0.4 <
log(kT500/keV) < 0.1 yields the following relation for
groups:

log( ¯ZFe,500) = (0.73±0.17) log(kT500/keV)−(0.61±0.03) (15)

with a 1σ dispersion in ¯ZFe,500 from residuals of 0.17 dex.

Buote (2000a, section A.1) has pointed out that the Fe
bias mentioned in §3.1 could cause an under-estimation of
the iron abundance for groups relative to clusters. In lower-
temperature systems, emission from the cooler Fe L-shell
line complex dominates the determination of ZFe from spec-
tral ﬁtting models. Gas at slightly diﬀerent temperatures
will excite Fe-L lines in this complex from ∼ 0.7 to 1.3 keV,
forming a broad emission peak around 1 keV. A simple 1-

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

temperature (1T) model ﬁt to such a spectrum will not be
able to reproduce this broad peak, and will inevitably de-
crease the assumed iron abundance in order to increase the
modelled contribution from the ﬂatter bremsstrahlung con-
tinuum emission. Such an eﬀect becomes less signiﬁcant for
hotter systems, where the Fe K-shell line complex at ∼ 6.5
keV dominates instead. This Fe bias could contribute to the
decrease in ZFe below log(kT500/keV) ∼ 0.2 in our dataset.
However, RP09 have shown that both 2T models and mass-
weighted measurements also indicate lower iron abundances
in groups relative to clusters. It is therefore unlikely that an
Fe bias is the sole cause of the T -ZFe correlation we see here.
RP09 have argued for a physical explanation, where this
correlation is due to more eﬃcient metal ejection from lower-
mass systems by SN winds at early times, before the group
virialised (see also Liang et al. 2016). Metal-rich gas removal
via AGN feedback at later times could also have a contribu-
tion (e.g. Kirkpatrick et al. 2009; Sanders et al. 2016). The

fact that groups are more susceptible to such processes than
clusters could also explain the larger scatter in the T -ZFe re-
lation for groups seen in Fig. 3. These physical processes will
be discussed further, with reference to our galaxy evolution
model, in §6.3.

3.3 An object-for-object comparison

There are many systems in our dataset that have been stud-
ied by more than one of the observational samples we con-
sider. This allows us to assess whether the homogenised val-
ues of T and ZFe we obtain from diﬀerent studies are in good
agreement with each other.

3.3.1 Comparing temperatures

In Fig. 4, we compare the temperatures at r500 obtained
from diﬀerent samples for the same objects. All objects

with three or more measurements of T500 and ¯ZFe,500 are
shown, and are ordered from left to right by ICM temper-
ature. There is very good agreement among the diﬀerent
samples. This close compatibility is partly due to the fact
that temperature proﬁles appear quite similar among groups
and clusters (§2.3). However, it is also an indication that our
homogenisation process is working properly.

The high temperatures obtained for three of the clus-
ters from the P03 sample are a clear exception to this close
compatibility. For S159-03, Hydra A, and A4059, the de-
rived T500 is more than 0.1 dex higher than that obtained
from other studies. In each case, this is due to the ambient
temperature quoted by P03 being signiﬁcantly higher than
the mean or even peak temperature quoted by other works.
Given that we are already considering their ambient tem-
perature values to represent the maximum temperature in
the ICM (§A.1.3), it is diﬃcult to see how these contrasting
measurements can be reconciled.

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

We note here that there is not enough overlap in our
dataset between Chandra and XMM-Newton measurements
of the same systems to determine if there is a systematic
oﬀset in the estimated temperature or iron abundance from
their EPIC and ACIS instruments (see e.g. Anderson et al.
2009; Schellenberger et al. 2015).

3.3.2 Comparing iron abundances

Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the iron abundances obtained
from diﬀerent samples for the same objects. While the com-
patibility among the diﬀerent samples is not as tight as for
temperature in Fig. 4, the values of ¯ZFe,500 obtained are re-
assuringly similar, and in most cases compatible within the
errors. This is promising, given that each sample measured
metallicity diﬀerently.

It is also encouraging that the iron abundances ob-
tained for groups using our default abundance proﬁle (Eqn.
11) are in reasonable agreement with those obtained using
individually-measured abundance proﬁles by RP09 (see also
§A.2.3). This also indicates that our homogenisation method
is working well.

Most of the discrepancies seen in Fig. 5 are due to large
diﬀerences in the iron abundances reported by the original
studies. Although our homogenisation process reduces these
discrepancies, it cannot completely remove them.

One related and interesting trend is that, in many cases,
the predicted value of ¯ZFe,500 for a given object increases
with the recency of the analysis. Two good examples of this
are MKW3s and A1795, which have each seen a systematic
increase of > 0.1 dex in their estimated ¯ZFe,500 from the year
1998 to 2011. Given that 4 of the 5 samples that contain
these clusters used XMM-Newton data, and that there is
no correlation between the chosen aperture size and the age
of the analysis (indeed, F98 and T04 use exactly the same
aperture), we presume that this upward revision is due to
continuous improvements in the atomic data assumed and
the way metallicities are obtained from X-ray spectra.

4 THE GALAXY EVOLUTION MODEL

In order to study the physical processes causing the trends
discussed in §3, we now turn to the semi-analytic model
of galaxy evolution, L-Galaxies (Springel et al. 2001a;
Guo et al. 2011; Henriques et al. 2015), which is run on the
dark matter (DM) subhaloes identiﬁed in the Millennium
N-body simulation (Springel et al. 2005). Newly-formed DM
subhaloes are seeded with hot gas at high redshift in pro-
portion to their virial mass (Mvir). This gas is then allowed
to cool, form stars, and be blown back out into the inter-
stellar medium (ISM) and CGM via supernova (SN) feed-
back. Modelling of gas heating from AGN feedback is also
included. L-Galaxies uses analytic prescriptions of phys-
ical processes, motivated by observations and simulations,
to govern the transfer of mass and energy among seven
galactic components (the central black hole, bulge stars, disc
stars, halo stars, ISM, CGM/ICM, and ejecta reservoir). The
model has been shown to reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation
and large-scale clustering of galaxies (Guo et al. 2011), the
galaxy stellar mass and optical luminosity functions from

z = 0 to 3 (Henriques et al. 2013), and the chemical proper-
ties of low-z galaxies (Yates et al. 2013). We refer the reader
to the supplementary material in Henriques et al. (2015) for
more details on the model.

The Millennium simulation has a particle resolution of
1.18 × 109 h−1
73 M⊙, and is able to reliably represent the in-
ternal structure of DM haloes (otherwise known as friends-
of-friends, or FOF, groups) above a resolution of ∼ 1000
particles, equating to masses above ∼ 1.18 × 1012 h−1
73 M⊙.
This means that the density proﬁles within the group and
cluster haloes investigated here, with virial masses above
1013 h−1
73 M⊙, are very well resolved. A WMAP1 cosmology
(Spergel et al. 2003) with the following parameters is as-
sumed in the simulation: Ωm = 0.25, Ωb = 0.045, ΩΛ = 0.75,
ns = 1, σ8 = 0.9, and H0 = 73 km s−1 Mpc−1.

This present work is based on the version of L-
Galaxies presented by Yates et al. (2013), which is an
adaptation of the model discussed in Guo et al. (2011), in-
cluding signiﬁcant improvements to the chemical enrichment
modelling. A new galactic chemical evolution (GCE) scheme
was implemented, so that the delayed enrichment of eleven
individual chemical elements (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si,
S, Ca, and Fe) from SNe-Ia, SNe-II, and stellar winds could
be properly modelled. This scheme includes the use of mass-
and metallicity-dependent stellar yields and lifetimes, and a
reformulation of the associated SN feedback so that energy
and heavy elements are released into the ISM and CGM
when stars die. Such a scheme is an improvement on the ‘in-
stantaneous recycling approximation’, which is sometimes
used in galaxy formation models for its simplicity, but does
not adequately describe the delayed enrichment of metals
from long-lived stars.

The model parameters used in the present work are
identical to those used by Yates et al. (2013), with the ex-
ception of those modiﬁcations discussed in §6.

5 MODEL SAMPLE

We select a sample of 2456 model DM haloes with M200 >
1.0 × 1013 h−1
73 M⊙ at z = 0 from the Munich semi-analytic
model of galaxy formation, L-Galaxies. Following our ear-
lier classiﬁcation of galaxy groups and clusters (§2.3), 2294
of these DM haloes are deﬁned as hosting a galaxy group,
and 162 are deﬁned as hosting a galaxy cluster. Our cho-
sen threshold value of log(kT500/keV) = 0.1 distinguish-
ing groups and clusters roughly corresponds to M200 =
1.2 × 1014 h−1
73 M⊙. Interestingly, this value is close to the
mass threshold chosen by Henriques et al. (2015) for trun-
cating ram-pressure stripping in group environments. It was
found that stripping of hot gas needs to be suppressed be-
low this mass in L-Galaxies in order to match the observed
fraction of passive dwarf galaxies at low redshift.

Three variations of the core L-Galaxies model are con-
sidered in this study. Our original model
is that used by
Yates et al. (2013) when studying the chemical composition
of the gas and stars within galaxies. Our new model con-
tains some improvements to the way infall onto DM haloes is
modelled (§6.1.1). And our extra iron model further includes
changes to the parameters that deﬁne the GCE treatment in
the model (§6.3). The diﬀerences between these three vari-
ations are detailed in Table 3.

The methods used to calculate r500, T500, and ¯ZFe,500
for our model systems are as close as possible to those used
for our observational dataset. Our chosen scale radius of
r500 is calculated as described in §2.2, using the values of
r200 and M200 obtained from the Millennium simulation
for each model DM halo. The halo density proﬁles in the
Millennium simulation are known to typically follow an
NFW proﬁle (Ludlow et al. 2013).

T500 is obtained by ﬁrst inverting Eqn. 6 (for clusters)
or Eqn. 8 (for groups) to determine the mean temperature
from the temperature at r200. This is given by

T200 = µmpσ2

200/k ,

(16)

where σ is the velocity dispersion, mp is the mass of a pro-
ton, µmp is the average mass of the particles (baryons and
leptons) in the ICM, µ = 0.58, and k = 8.6173×10−8 keV/K
is Boltzmann’s constant. Then, Eqn. 6 or Eqn. 8 are used
again to obtain T500 from the mean temperature.

The average iron abundance within r500 is obtained
using the same gas density and iron abundance proﬁles
described in §2.4. We consider all model clusters to have
CCs, as they all exhibit AGN feedback at z = 0 in L-
Galaxies. Abundances are also normalised to the solar
abundances provided by Grevesse & Sauval (1998), and are
left as mass weighted, in order to fairly compare with the
mass-weighted values we derive for our observational dataset
(see Rasia et al. 2008; Crain et al. 2013).

The semi-analytic model does not provide any spatial
information on the distribution of baryonic mass within DM
haloes. Therefore, for the gas density proﬁles, we assume
that rc = a and determine β using the ﬁt to the emission-
weighted ICM temperature for groups and clusters provided
by Sanderson et al. (2003);

β = 0.439 ¯T 0.20

.

(17)

The trend that gas-density proﬁles are ﬂatter in lower-
temperature systems has been noted by a number of stud-
ies (e.g. Mohr & Evrard 1997; Ponman, Cannon & Navarro
1999; Horner, Mushotzky & Scharf 1999; Sanderson et al.
2003), and is also present in the data compiled from the
Reiprich & B¨ohringer (2002) and RP09 samples for our
observational dataset. For Eqn. 17, the slope reaches the
canonical value of 2/3 often assumed for galaxy clusters at
log(kT500/keV) ∼ 0.75. The consequences of a temperature-

dependent gas-density slope on the baryon factions in model
groups and clusters are discussed in §6.1.

6 MODEL RESULTS

6.1 The baryon fraction

We begin our analysis of our model results by ﬁrst look-
ing at the baryon fractions (fb) in groups and clusters.
We are careful to deﬁne fb as it is deﬁned in the observa-
tional studies to which we compare. Therefore, we consider
fb = MICM,500/M500, where MICM,500 is the total hot gas
mass within r500, and M500 is the total gravitating mass
within r500.

The top panel of Fig. 6 shows the T -fb relation for
groups and clusters in our original model (red points). That
is, the version of L-Galaxies used to study the chem-
ical composition of local galaxies by Yates et al. (2013).
The same relation for nearby observed systems studied
by Lin, Mohr & Stanford (2003), Vikhlinin et al. (2006),
and RP09 is shown for comparison. The Planck value
of the cosmic baryon fraction, fb,cos,
is given by the
grey dashed line. We note that values of M500 for the
Lin, Mohr & Stanford (2003) and RP09 samples have been
re-derived here, obtaining M500 from a ﬁt to our model T500-
M500 relation, rather than the observed ¯Tew-M500 relation
of Finoguenov, Reiprich & B¨ohringer (2001b). This is done
so that the diﬀerences in the baryon content of groups and
clusters can be more clearly analysed, without concern for
diﬀerences in the assumed DM content. The M500 values
obtained by Vikhlinin et al. (2006) are uncorrected, as they
are individually calculated for each cluster using a robust hy-
drostatic equilibrium model of their own. We note that the
baryon fractions obtained from the Lin, Mohr & Stanford
(2003) and Vikhlinin et al. (2006) data now match each
other much more closely. This indicates that the previous
discrepancies at ﬁxed temperature were predominantly due
to the diﬀerent assumptions made about the gravitating
masses.

Our original model T -fb relation in Fig. 6 exhibits
a positive correlation (though not as steep as observed).
This is because we have allowed the gas density slope to
vary with temperature (Eqn. 17). Lower-temperature sys-
tems are therefore assumed to have ﬂatter gas-density pro-
ﬁles and a smaller fraction of their total hot gas residing
within r500. Plotting the baryon fraction within r200 for

our model systems would instead return a relation that is
almost independent of temperature, as has been reported
in previous theoretical studies (e.g. Nagashima et al. 2005a;
De Lucia et al. 2004; Arrigoni et al. 2010b). This is the con-
sequence of all DM haloes being ‘topped-up’ to the assumed
cosmic baryon fraction (accounting for heating by ultravio-
let background radiation) by construction in these models,
including L-Galaxies. We note that this is likely to be a
poor assumption, as (a) the observed kT -fb relation extrap-
olated out to r200 is also seen to have a positive gradient
(e.g. Sanderson et al. 2003), and (b) the middle panels in

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

Fig. 6 show that there is simply too much gas within r500
in our model systems. Indeed, there is a scatter of model
groups and clusters with baryon fractions well in excess of
fb,cos in Fig. 6. Motivated by this fact, we re-assess the way
infall is implemented in L-Galaxies.

6.1.1 Infall modiﬁcations

We make three modiﬁcations to L-Galaxies in order
to better model the way pristine gas is allowed to in-
fall onto DM haloes. First, we update the assumed cos-

mic baryon fraction in the model
from the WMAP1
value of fb,cos = 0.17 (Spergel et al. 2003) to the Planck
value of fb,cos = 0.154 (Planck Collaboration XVI 2013;
Gonzalez et al. 2013). This reduces the amount of pristine
infall allowed onto central DM haloes, and therefore also
fb. Updating only fb,cos from the WMAP1 to Planck value,
while assuming all other cosmological parameters are un-
changed, is justiﬁed in this work because we are interested in
more accurately reproducing the baryon fraction in real sys-
tems, rather than more accurately representing the masses
of their DM haloes.

We also adjust the eﬃciency of the AGN feedback as-
sumed, noting that its current prescription in L-Galaxies
is only to reheat gas, not eject it out of the DM halo.
The black hole hot accretion eﬃciency, κ, is lowered from
1.5 × 10−3 M⊙/yr to 0.75 × 10−3 M⊙/yr. This ensures that
the decrease in fb,cos doesn’t lead to an under-production
of massive galaxies by z = 0 in our model. We consider this
small reduction reasonable, as its previous value was itself
tuned to the high-mass end of the z = 0 stellar mass function
(Guo et al. 2011, section 3.9).

The second modiﬁcation we make is related to the virial

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

mass (i.e. M200) of the DM halo (i.e. FOF group) contain-
ing the central cluster galaxy. We have found that M200 can
gradually vary over time for some model systems, due to
changes in the morphology of the cluster. A galaxy clus-
ter’s FOF group can be stretched and distorted during in-
teractions with other FOF groups, which in turn aﬀects the
value of r200. This prompts the infall of pristine gas onto
the halo, in order to maintain the baryon fraction at around
the value of fb,cos. Subsequently, the FOF group of these
model clusters starts to shrink again, decreasing M200 and
therefore increasing the baryon fraction above the cosmic
limit. We note that the model clusters’ total DM-particle
mass including DM particles outside of r200 is not aﬀected
in the same way as their M200 value, demonstrating that
the change in M200 is due to changes in morphology, rather
than signiﬁcant accretion or loss of dark matter. Such events
are causing the baryon fraction to be over-estimated in some
model clusters due to superﬂuous infall of pristine gas from
the IGM.

We have addressed this issue by requiring that a clus-
ter’s virial mass cannot decrease with cosmic time. This is
done as a pre-processing step before the semi-analytic model
is run, by stepping through the DM halo merger trees from
low to high redshift, correcting M200 where necessary.

The third modiﬁcation we make also aﬀects the amount
of baryonic infall allowed onto DM haloes. Previously, when
calculating the amount of infall required, only baryons in
satellite galaxies within r200 were considered, and the baryon
fraction was assumed to be Mb,200/M200 when calculating
infall. Such a choice, although reasonable, does not take ac-
count of the large number of FOF-group-member satellite
galaxies that will fall within r200 of the central object at
some later time. As a satellite approaches r200 in our model,
its DM subhalo is already being stripped, but L-Galaxies
does not allow its baryons to be stripped until it falls into
the cluster. Therefore, when a large satellite does cross r200,
it does so with an enhanced baryon fraction. This causes
a jump in the baryon fraction of the cluster above fb,cos,
as it is has already been ‘topped-up’ to the cosmic baryon
fraction by pristine infall.

To remedy this issue, we instead check that the value
of Mb,FOF/M200, rather than Mb,200/M200, does not exceed
fb,cos when calculating infall. This larger value therefore ac-
counts for all baryons that are in the FOF group, including
those not currently within r200, and prevents erroneous ac-
cretion of pristine gas before the infall of a new DM subhalo.
Note that both Mb,200/M200 and Mb,FOF/M200 are
alternative
the baryon fraction to
MICM,500/M500, which is what is typically measured when
observing of the hot, X-ray-emitting gas in groups and clus-
ters. For this reason, we always plot MICM,500/M500 when
comparing to observations in this work.

interpretations of

Fig. 7 shows the eﬀect of the three modiﬁcations de-
scribed above on the baryon fractions of our model groups
and clusters. Nearly all systems now have fb below fb,cos
in this new model, and the baryon fractions in clusters are
now in better agreement with those observed. This is due to
our new model matching the observed ICM masses, even in
low-temperature clusters (middle-right panel, Fig. 7).

However, the ICM masses in galaxy groups are still over-
estimated in L-Galaxies (middle-left panel, Fig. 7). This is
a strong indication that gas removal by feedback is also re-

quired in our model. As mentioned in §3.2, AGN feedback is
a good candidate for this (e.g. Bower, McCarthy & Benson
2008; Fabjan et al. 2010), as it is likely to have a more sig-
niﬁcant eﬀect in the shallower gravitational potential wells
of groups than those of clusters, while also not aﬀecting even
smaller systems which don’t contain super-massive black
holes (SMBHs). Possible improvements to our AGN feed-
back modelling are discussed further in §6.4.

6.2 Metals in galaxies

Before turning to the iron abundances in our model groups
and clusters, it is ﬁrst important to check that the modiﬁ-
cations described in §6.1 do not destroy L-Galaxies’ cor-
respondence with observations on smaller scales. Therefore,
we show the [Fe/H] and [O/Fe] distributions for the stellar

relation for the stars in local elliptical galaxies in Fig. 8.

We can see that the peaks of the new Milky Way [Fe/H]
and [O/Fe] distributions (black) are shifted very slightly to-
wards solar values (vertical, dashed lines in Fig. 8) compared
to our original model (green), and the oxygen enhancements

in the most massive ellipticals are shifted to slightly lower
values (by ∼ 0.01 dex). These small changes are likely due to
a slight reduction in galaxy star-formation rates at high red-
shift that is a consequence of a lower assumed cosmic baryon
fraction. However, overall, our modiﬁcations have had a neg-
ligible eﬀect on the chemical properties of the stars within

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

galaxies. The eﬀect of our extra iron model on the chemical
composition within galaxies is discussed in §6.3.

6.3 Iron in model clusters

In Fig. 9, we show the kT500- ¯ZFe,500 relation for all our 2456
model systems at z = 0 (red), with our full observational
dataset plotted in the background for reference. ¯ZFe,500 is
calculated for our model clusters by rescaling the ratio of the
total iron mass to hydrogen mass in the hot gas components
of all cluster members within r200, using the same process
utilised for our observational dataset (§2.4).

Firstly, we note that our new model

roughly re-
produces the iron abundances measured for the hottest
(log(kT500/keV) & 0.8) and coldest (log(kT500/keV) . 0.2)
clusters. This is partly due to the 0.1 dex increase in iron
abundance compared to our original model, roughly half of
which is due to adopting the Planck cosmic baryon fraction,
and half due to our other infall modiﬁcations (§6.1). Scaling
ZFe to the same radius for the model and observations also
has a signiﬁcant eﬀect, revealing the model to be a better
representation of the data than previously thought.

However,

intermediate-temperature clusters (0.2 <
log(kT500/keV) < 0.8) in our model still appear under-
abundant in iron compared to the data by up to ∼ 0.2 dex.
This is because, although the slope of the model T -ZFe rela-
tion is also negative, it is not as steep as observed (although
it does steepen at higher redshift, see §6.5), with a value
of -0.10 at z = 0 compared to -0.26 for our observational
dataset.

Agreement between the model and data would improve
if the negative slope in the observed T -ZFe relation were
partly a bias eﬀect (§3.1). The true iron abundances of
intermediate-temperature systems would then be lower, in
better correspondence with L-Galaxies, and the slopes of
the model and observed T -ZFe relations would be more sim-
ilar. We also note that the iron masses in our model clusters
are marginally consistent with the upper limits derived by
De Grandi et al. (2004) (top-right panel of Fig. 10). How-
ever, it is also possible that there is simply not enough iron
produced and distributed into the ICM in our model sys-
tems.

The problem of low iron abundances in the ICM has
been encountered by galaxy evolution models before. For
example, Nagashima et al. (2005a) attempted to boost the
iron mass in the ICM of clusters in the Galform semi-
analytic model (Cole et al. 2000) by assuming a ﬂat stellar
IMF for stars formed in starbursts. This allows a much larger
fraction of iron-producing SNe-Ia in the stellar populations
of central galaxies, which undergo many mergers as they
evolve. Alternatively, Arrigoni et al. (2010b) allowed 80 per
cent of the metal-rich material ejected by stellar winds and
SNe to be deposited directly into the CGM around their
model galaxies. The number of SN-Ia progenitor systems
was also increased, by altering the IMF and increasing the
number of SN-Ia progenitors per stellar population. These
changes boost the production of iron as well as its ability to
enrich the hot, diﬀuse gas surrounding galaxies.

Fig. 11 shows the eﬀect of making changes to L-
Galaxies similar to those chosen by Arrigoni et al. (2010b).
We set the IMF slope to αIMF = 2.15 (shallower than
the original 2.3) and increase SN-Ia production by setting

ment of the ICM by galactic SNe-Ia. There is better agreement be-
tween the model and observations for intermediate-temperature
clusters, compared to our new model. However, there is worse
agreement elsewhere (§6.3).

Yates et al.

ASNIa = 0.04 (greater than our default choice of 0.028). This
means that 4.0 per cent of stars in the mass range 3 − 16 M⊙
are assumed to be born as SN-Ia-producing binaries. Given
the slightly top-heavier IMF, this equates to 0.16 per cent
of all stellar objects being SN-Ia progenitors, compared to
the 0.11 per cent assumed in our new model. We also allow
100 per cent of SN-Ia ejecta and 80 per cent of SN-II ejecta
to directly pollute the CGM around galaxies. Hereafter, we
refer to this version of the model (which also includes the
modiﬁcations described in §6.1) as the extra-iron model (see
Table 3).

We can see from Fig. 11 that the extra iron model pro-
duces iron abundances more in line with those observed in
intermediate-temperature clusters. Although this could be
deemed a success (assuming the measured ZFe for these ob-
jects is accurate), it is important to note that such changes
to the stellar IMF, SN-Ia production rate, and metallicity
of galactic winds will also aﬀect the chemical composition
of systems smaller than clusters. For example, Fig. 11 also
shows that ZFe in groups is now much higher than observed,
even more so than in our new model. Furthermore, Fig. 12
shows that the [O/Fe] distribution in Milky-Way-type stel-
lar discs (black, middle panel) is now shifted signiﬁcantly to
higher values compared to our original model (green), with
a peak around [O/Fe] = 0.18 in contrast to the observed
peak at ∼ 0.08 dex (red). Likewise, the bottom panel of
Fig. 12 shows there is no longer any correspondence with
the observed M∗-[O/Fe] relation for elliptical galaxies (or-
ange) in the extra iron model. The amplitude is too high, and
there is now a negative correlation between M∗ and [O/Fe].
Nagashima et al. (2005b) also found such a negative corre-
lation when implementing their ﬂat starburst IMF.

These inconsistencies highlight the fact that we must be
careful when changing GCE parameters in galaxy evolution
models. Although altering the stellar IMF, SN-Ia production
eﬃciency, or galactic wind metallicity are promising ways to
improve the chemical properties in clusters, they can eas-
ily destroy the correspondence between model and data for
other systems. Given this, we choose to focus on our new
model in the rest of this work, which is able to reproduce
the iron abundances in the hottest clusters simultaneously
with the chemical compositions of (a) the star-forming gas in
local emission-line galaxies, (b) the Milky Way stellar disc,
and (c) the integrated stellar populations of nearby ellipti-
cals (Yates et al. 2013).

6.4 Iron in model groups

In Fig. 9, we have shown that the hot gas surrounding
galaxy groups is too iron-rich in our new model. Observa-
tions suggest a strong positive correlation between temper-
ature and ZFe in groups, whereas the slight anti-correlation
seen in clusters simply continues to lower temperatures in
L-Galaxies.

The left-hand panels of Fig. 10 tell us that this over-
abundance in the hot gas of model groups is due to an ex-
cess of iron. This, combined with the fact that these systems
also have a slight excess of hydrogen (see bottom-left panels
in Figs. 7 and 10) strongly suggests that iron-rich material
needs to be removed from their DM haloes. This would si-
multaneously correct both their baryon fractions and their
iron abundances. Metals are already driven out of group-

sized DM haloes at high redshift by SN feedback in our
model, but this seems to be insuﬃcient. As mentioned in
§6.1, AGN feedback is a promising alternative candidate.

Currently, L-Galaxies does not include a prescription
for gas removal via AGN feedback. Instead, only heating of
the gas in the ISM and CGM is considered, in order to oﬀset
cooling in massive DM haloes. Bower, McCarthy & Benson
(2008) have proposed an AGN-feedback implementation for
the Galform semi-analytic model in which AGN can heat
and remove X-ray-emitting (i.e. cooling) gas from the ICM.
Given that this gas tends to be at lower radii and more
metal rich, such an implementation is likely to also have
the desired aﬀect on ICM iron abundances in L-Galaxies.
We would also expect to see a peak in the T -ZFe relation
at intermediate temperatures with such an implementation,
as indicated by observations (§3.1). This peak would signify
the optimum size of DM halo in which the ICM can be
most eﬃciently enriched. An investigation into alternative
methods of implementing AGN feedback will be the focus
of future work.

6.5 Iron abundance evolution with redshift

In the top panel of Fig. 13, we show the mean evolution
of the iron abundance within r200 for model clusters from
z = 7 (lookback time ∼ 13 Gyr) to the present day. 80 mea-
surements of the ICM iron abundance in observed clusters
over the redshift range 0.3 < z < 1.27 from Balestra et al.
(2007) and Anderson et al. (2009) are also shown, binned
by lookback time (green points). In Fig. 13, we only con-
sider model clusters within the temperature range 0.2 <
log(T500/keV) < 1.0 at z = 0.56. This is the range of
temperatures covered by the observational dataset, which
has a median redshift of 0.56. Observed abundances have
been corrected in the same way as described in §2.4, as-
suming the locally-measured iron abundance gradient for
CC clusters by Matsushita 2011, although we note that
abundance gradients could evolve over time (e.g. Cora 2006;
McDonald et al. 2016). Estimates of r200 were obtained fol-
lowing Evrard, Metzler & Navarro (1996), via

r200 = 2.53q ¯Tew/10.0 keV

· (Ω0[1 + z]3 + 1 − Ω0)−1/2 h−1

73 Mpc ,

(18)

where Ω0 ≡ Ωm,z=0 = 0.25 for our chosen cosmology.

There is clear consistency between our model and the
observations across the full comparable redshift range, al-
though the mean scatter in the observed iron abundance
measurements is considerable (±0.28 dex). This agreement
is rather surprising, given that the ISM in model star-
forming galaxies appears to be over-enriched with oxygen at
high redshift, already reaching present-day values by z ∼ 2
(Yates, Kauﬀmann & Guo 2012, section 6.4). Nonetheless,
it is promising that L-Galaxies is consistent with the ob-
served evolution of iron in the ICM of hot clusters back to
z = 1.27, given the uncertainties.

Our model indicates that an average of 3 per cent of
the iron mass found in the ICM of hot clusters at z = 0
is already present by z = 2, 17 per cent is present by z =
1, and 46 per cent is present by z = 0.5. Given that the
accretion of hydrogen onto DM haloes is also occurring at

gion. Observed values of ¯ZFe,200 for 74 clusters (a total of 80 mea-

bars. Bottom panel: The mean ¯ZFe,200 evolution for the cold-

15 systems, red]. Shaded areas indicate the 1σ scatter in the
mean. The inlaid panel shows the same evolution up to look-
back time = 4 Gyr, including intermediate-temperature clusters
[0.4 < log(T500,z=0/keV) < 0.7, 21 systems, green].

the same time as iron enrichment, this equates to an iron
abundance fraction (ZFe,z/ZFe,z=0) of 66 per cent at z = 2,
79 per cent at z = 1, and 85 per cent at z = 0.5. Our
model therefore supports the conclusion that a signiﬁcant
amount of the metallicity evolution in clusters is complete
by z ∼ 1, as suggested by a number of observational studies
(e.g. Mushotzky & Loewenstein 1997; Allen & Fabian 1998;
Tozzi et al. 2003; Baldi et al. 2012; McDonald et al. 2016).
Our model also indicates that a negative correlation be-
tween temperature and iron abundance for clusters has been
in place since z ∼ 3. The bottom panel of Fig. 13 shows
the mean evolution of ¯ZFe,200 for a set of the hottest (red)
and coldest (blue) clusters in our model. The inlaid panel
shows the same evolution below a lookback time of 4 Gyr,
including intermediate-temperature clusters (green). Colder
clusters clearly have a higher iron abundance than hotter
clusters. In §3.1, we have discussed observational evidence
for such a T -ZFe anti-correlation at low redshift. At higher
redshift, Tozzi et al. (2003) and Balestra et al. (2007) have
also found a signiﬁcant negative slope from z = 0.3 to 1.27
(but see Baldi et al. 2012).

The cause of this weak negative correlation in L-
Galaxies is the presence of large hydrogen reservoirs in
hotter clusters. At z = 0, the coldest clusters have, on aver-
age, 14 per cent of the iron found in the hottest clusters, but
only 12.5 per cent of the hydrogen. This leads to a diﬀerence

in the mean present-day ICM iron abundance of ∼ 0.05 dex.
At z ∼ 3, the diﬀerence is even greater, around 0.12 dex.

Hotter clusters have enhanced hydrogen masses at high
redshift because they host a larger number of satellite sys-
tems. The hydrogen in the CGM of these satellites is ef-
ﬁciently stripped into the ICM over time through ram-
pressure and tidal eﬀects. Panel A in Fig. 14 shows that
the minor progenitor systems4 of the hottest clusters at
z = 3.1 (red) contain a larger mass of hydrogen in their
combined CGM than the minor progenitors of the coldest
clusters (blue). All this material is rapidly stripped into the
ICM once the satellites fall within r200, diluting the ICM
metallicity.

A more observationally-motivated way to look at this
phenomenon is via the total stellar-mass-to-hot-gas-mass
ratio, M∗,tot/Mhot,tot. Panel B of Fig. 14 shows that
M∗,tot/Mhot,tot positively correlates with ZFe, and Panel
C shows that the hottest clusters typically have lower
M∗,tot/Mhot,tot than the coldest clusters in L-Galaxies at
z = 3.1. Given that hotter clusters also have higher M∗,tot,
this is another indication that ICM metallicities were diluted
in these systems due to excess accretion of pristine gas.

We therefore conclude that temperature-dependent di-
lution is a possible explanation for some of the residual T -
ZFe anti-correlation seen in the real cluster population.

4 The term ‘minor progenitors’ refers to all DM subhaloes that
will have merged with the cluster’s central DM subhalo by z = 0.
The central DM subhalo itself at any given redshift is referred to
as the ‘main progenitor’.

7 SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS

A homogenised dataset of 79 groups and clusters (159 indi-
vidual measurements) has been compiled, in order to study
the T -ZFe relation in the ICM with unprecedented accuracy.
We correct for diﬀerences in aperture size, solar abundance,
and cosmology among the samples used, and adopt T , ρgas,
and ZFe proﬁles that are adapted for each cluster individu-
ally (§2.1).

This dataset is compared to model groups and clus-
ters from the Munich semi-analytic model of galaxy evolu-
tion, L-Galaxies. This comparison allows us to (a) assess
L-Galaxies’s ability to model massive systems, and (b) pro-
vide a physical explanation for those observed trends that
the model does reproduce. Our main conclusions are as fol-
lows:

• Once homogenised, the scatter in the observed T -ZFe
relation for clusters is reduced signiﬁcantly (§3). The 1σ
dispersion in ZFe of only 0.10 dex around a linear ﬁt above
log(kT500/keV) = 0.25 is comparable to the dispersion in the
well-studied M∗-ZO relation for local, star-forming galaxies.
• There is a slight anti-correlation between T and ZFe
for clusters above log(kT500/keV) ∼ 0.25, with a slope of
-0.26 (§3.1). This anti-correlation could partly be explained
by measurement biases, but is likely to also have a residual
physical origin.

• A possible explanation for this T -ZFe anti-correlation is
increased accretion of hydrogen by the most massive clus-
ters, via stripping of infalling satellite systems. This is the
cause of a weak anti-correlation in our galaxy evolution
model, with a slope of -0.10 (§6.3).

• The iron abundances observed in the hottest clusters
are reasonably reproduced in L-Galaxies (§6.3). This is
true without requiring any changes to the rate of SNe-Ia, the
IMF, or the metallicity of galactic winds assumed. This re-
sult is achieved while simultaneously matching the chemical
properties observed in the ISM of local star-forming galax-
ies, the G dwarfs in Milky-Way-type stellar discs, and the
stellar populations of nearby ellipticals.

• The iron abundance in intermediate-temperature clus-
ters is under-estimated in our model by ∼ 0.2 dex (§6.3).
This could partly be due to temperature-dependent biases
in the way ZFe is measured. However, it is possible that
L-Galaxies is also not correctly modelling these systems.
When treating this problem, we note that modiﬁcations to
the GCE modelling to boost the enrichment of the ICM can
also destroy the correspondence with smaller-scale systems.
• The iron abundances and baryon fractions in galaxy
groups are over-estimated in our model (§6.1 and 6.4). Al-
lowing AGN feedback to remove metal-rich gas from galaxy
groups is a viable solution to both these problems. Such re-
modelling in L-Galaxies will be the focus of future work.
• The model z-ZFe relation for hot clusters is consistent
with that seen in observations from z = 0.3 to at least 1.27
(§6.5). In L-Galaxies, the iron abundance in the ICM at
z = 2 is 66 per cent that seen at z = 0. At z = 1, it is 79
per cent, and at z = 0.5, it is 85 per cent.

of the instrumentation and spectral ﬁtting codes used,
temperature-dependent measurement biases, projected ver-
sus de-projected quantities, 1T versus multi-T spectral mod-
elling, single-β versus multi-β gas density proﬁles, the vari-
ation in iron abundance proﬁles within the same class of
system (e.g. CCs), to name only a few, have not been in-
vestigated in detail here. However, it is promising that we
are still able to obtain a small scatter in the T -ZFe rela-
tion for clusters. This provides a clearer picture of the true
iron abundances in groups and clusters than was possible
before, with the promise of a still clearer picture once these
additional eﬀects are also accounted for.

In the case of our model results, it is important to note
that, despite the improvement compared to previous theo-
retical studies, L-Galaxies still appears to be inadequate at
modelling lower-temperature galaxy associations. This prob-
lem has also been highlighted by Henriques et al. (2015). We
caution that it is important that future modelling eﬀorts,
while attempting to resolve this issue, also account for the
tight constraints provided by having to simultaneously re-
produce the chemical properties of a wide range of galaxy
systems.

APPENDIX A: OBSERVATIONAL SAMPLES

Here, we outline the ten diﬀerent low-redshift observational
studies we utilise in this work. These have been roughly sep-
arated into cluster and group samples below, although some
of the cluster samples contain a few groups as we deﬁne them
(§2.1), and vice versa. Unless stated otherwise, quoted ICM
temperatures and iron abundances are converted into T500
and ¯ZFe,500 using our default radial proﬁles, as described in
§2.3 and 2.4.

The kT500 - ¯ZFe,500 relations for each sample are shown
in Fig. 15 for the cluster samples and Fig. 18 for the group
samples.

A.1 Cluster samples

used to obtain values of T500 and ¯ZFe,500. Of these 34 ob-
jects (of which 6 are groups), 9 are identiﬁed as NCC. Mean
temperatures (assumed to be emission weighted) and iron
abundances were measured within a clustercentric annulus
of inner radius 0.07 h−1
73 Mpc.
Iron abundances are provided by F98 in their table 1, and are
corrected from the Anders & Grevesse (1989) photospheric
abundances originally used to those of Grevesse & Sauval
(1998).

73 Mpc and outer radius 0.27 h−1

A.1.2 DGM01 (De Grandi & Molendi 2001)

De Grandi & Molendi (2001, hereafter DGM01) observed 17
galaxy clusters with BeppoSAX, obtaining projected iron
abundance proﬁles out to a maximum radius between 8 and
20 arcminutes (equivalent to between 0.4 and 1.2 h−1
73 Mpc,
or 0.2 and 0.5r180), the largest outer radii of any survey
considered here. All 17 of these clusters (9 CC and 8 NCC)
could be used to obtain T500 and ¯ZFe,500. Values of ¯Tew from
table 2 of the companion paper by De Grandi & Molendi
(2002) were used to obtain T500.

¯ZFe,500 was obtained from the average iron abundances
given in their table 2, rescaling from the meteoric abun-
dances of Anders & Grevesse (1989) that were originally
used to those of Grevesse & Sauval (1998). DGM01 reported
their own typical iron abundance proﬁle for their CC clus-
ters, given by our Eqn. 11, with values of xc = 0.04 and
α = 0.18. Given that their average iron abundances are
obtained from ﬁtting a constant to their radial measure-
ments, we choose to use their proﬁle for each of their CC
clusters, rather than our default one. We note that the dif-
ference in the value of ¯ZFe,500 obtained is less than 0.02
dex, due to the large aperture size used. DGM01 conclude
that the iron abundance proﬁle in NCC clusters is eﬀectively
ﬂat. Later works have instead argued that NCC clusters
do have negative gradients, similar to or slightly shallower
than those found in CC clusters (e.g. Tamura et al. 2004;
Sanderson, O’Sullivan & Ponman 2009; Matsushita 2011).
Here, we take a conservative approach, by assuming a ﬂat
gradient for the DGM01 NCC clusters, as DGM01 sug-
gested. Assuming a steeper gradient would lower the ﬁnal
estimated value of ¯ZFe,500 by 0.05-0.10 dex.

A3627 is classiﬁed as having a CC, based on the
temperature proﬁle measured by De Grandi & Molendi
(2002). The merging system A3266 has a measured CCT
of 7.51 h−1/2
73 Gyr and therefore has a weak CC under
the Hudson et al. (2010) deﬁnition. However, given that
A3266 also has a classical mass deposition rate consistent
with zero (White, Jones & Forman 1997; Peres et al. 1998;
Hudson et al. 2010), a central-to-virial temperature ratio
greater than one (Hudson et al. 2010), and that the low-
entropy gas in its core region is more likely to be stripped
from an infalling sub-cluster than to be a signature of a
cool core (Finoguenov et al. 2006a), we choose to deﬁne this
cluster as NCC in this work.

A.1.1 F98 (Fukazawa et al. 1998)

A.1.3 P03 (Peterson et al. 2003)

The oldest dataset utilised here is that of Fukazawa et al.
(1998, hereafter F98). Their study relied on ASCA X-ray
data for 40 galaxy groups and clusters, of which 34 could be

Peterson et al. (2003, hereafter P03) observed 14 CC sys-
tems with XMM-Newton, to obtain mean iron abundances,
as well as O, Ne, Mg, and Si abundances, which we

symbols indicate NCC systems. The grey vertical line separates groups and clusters.

rescale from the meteoric abundances of Anders & Grevesse
(1989) originally used to those of Grevesse & Sauval (1998).
Enough data to derive T500 and ¯ZFe,500 estimates are avail-
able for 11 of these objects. We assume that the measure-
ments of temperature and abundance are representative of
the cluster core, whose physical radius can be obtained from
rcore/arcsec in their table 3 and the angular scale from their
table 2.

We further assume the quoted “ambient” or “upper”
temperature (from their table 5) is the peak temperature
of the X-ray-emitting gas in the cluster, and correct this
to ¯Tmw using the factor of 1.21 provided by Vikhlinin et al.
(2006, eqn. 9).

Only one of the P03 objects (NGC533) has T500 < 0.1
keV and so is classiﬁed as a group in this work. This means
that the correction to obtain ¯ZFe,500 for NGC533 is larger
than for the rest of the P03 sample, as it utilises our steeper
group proﬁle (§2.4). The classiﬁcation of CC for A1835 was

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

taken from the analysis of Schmidt, Allen & Fabian (2001)
using Chandra data. They found a steep drop in ICM tem-
perature at low radii, indicative of a cool core.

The unexpectedly high iron abundance of log( ¯ZFe,500) =
−0.35 obtained for A496 from the P03 sample data (see
Fig 5) is likely due to our assumption that their average
abundances are representative of the entire cluster core. P03
measured the core radius of A496 as 255 h−1
73 kpc, which
is signiﬁcantly larger than the 20.5 h−1
73 kpc calculated by
Reiprich & B¨ohringer (2002) and also larger than the 2’-
diameter square aperture (80.5 h−1
73 kpc for A496) within
which P03 selected photons (see their section 4). We can
therefore assume that our derived ¯ZFe,500 is over-estimated
in this particular case.

A.1.4 T04 (Tamura et al. 2004)

Tamura et al. (2004, hereafter T04) used XMM-Newton

22

Yates et al.

spectra of 19 nearby systems to obtain mean iron abun-
dances, as well as O, Si, and S abundances. We rescale these
from the photometric abundances of Anders & Grevesse
(1989) originally used to those of Grevesse & Sauval (1998).
17 of these objects (1 group, 16 clusters), of which 4 are
NCC, are suitable for obtaining T500 and ¯ZFe,500 estimates.
As advised by T04, MKW9 is not included in our analysis,
due to the very high uncertainty in its iron abundance. As
mentioned in §A.1.3, cluster A1835 is classiﬁed as contain-
ing a CC. Mean (emission-weighted) temperatures outside
the cool region are taken from their table 1 and used to
obtain T500. No errors are quoted by T04 for their mean
temperature measurements.

In order to retain as many of the T04 sample as pos-
sible, abundances from the intermediate annulus of 0.07 −
0.27 h−1
73 Mpc (i.e. from 0.03 − 0.1r180 to 0.1 − 0.4r180) are
used (their table 4), rather than the overall mean abun-
dances provided for a sub-set of their objects. As always,
we account for the inner and outer observed radii when
calculating ¯ZFe,500. T04 note that they see no clear diﬀer-
ence between the iron abundance gradients in their CC and
NCC clusters (their section 5.2), with both showing cen-
tral enhancements. They cite the improved spatial resolution
of XMM-Newton as the reason for this ﬁnding, compared
to previous conclusions (e.g. De Grandi & Molendi 2001).
Here, we again take a conservative approach and assume our
default CC proﬁle for CC clusters and our shallower default
NCC proﬁle for NCC clusters (§2.4). If we were to assume
a steeper proﬁle for NCC clusters, it would serve only to
further reduce the estimated value of ¯ZFe,500 by ∼ 0.05 dex
for these objects (§A.1.7).

As noted in §2.1, measurements of rc and β compiled by
Reiprich & B¨ohringer (2002) are used for all our cluster sam-
ples where possible. One exception to this rule is A399, for
which an uncertain core radius (σ(rc)/rc = 0.29) is quoted
by Reiprich & B¨ohringer (2002). In this case, we rely on the
more recent measurements of Sakelliou & Ponman (2004),
who measured rc = 148.9 h−1
73 kpc,
β = 0.498 and σ(β) = 0.001.

73 kpc, σ(rc) = 0.5 h−1

A.1.5 dP07 (de Plaa et al. 2007)

de Plaa et al. (2007, hereafter dP07) also used XMM-
Newton archive data of 22 nearby clusters to obtain mean
temperatures and iron abundances, as well as abundances
of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Ni. All but one of these measurements
could be used for our analysis, or which 4 are NCC. The ex-
traction radius within which measurements were taken was
0.2 r500.

As the dP07 extraction radius does not go all the
way out to r500, we use the maximum ICM tempera-
tures quoted in their table 2 to obtain T500, rather than
the mean temperatures from the inner regions only. As
the Vikhlinin et al. (2006) temperature proﬁle we use itself
peaks at around 0.2 r500, we can assume that the maximum
temperature measured by dP07 is the true peak tempera-
ture within the whole cluster. Mean iron abundances are
taken from their table A.1, and converted from the proto-
solar abundances of Lodders (2003) originally used to those
of Grevesse & Sauval (1998).

A3530 was classiﬁed as an NCC cluster, based on the
high cooling time and zero mass deposition rate measured

by Chen et al. (2007). And A3560 was classiﬁed as hav-
ing an NCC, based on the ﬂat temperature proﬁle within
∼ 0.4 h−1
73 Mpc measured by Bardelli et al. (2002) using Bep-
poSAX data.

A.1.6 M11 (Matsushita 2011)

Matsushita (2011, hereafter M11) analysed 28 galaxy clus-
ters observed by XMM-Newton, of which 26 could be used
here (6 being classiﬁed as NCC clusters). All objects have
T500 > 0.1 keV.

We note here that, although M11 have classiﬁed cluster
A3558 as not containing a central cD galaxy (and there-
fore unlikely to have a cool core), the mass deposition rate
measured by Peres et al. (1998) for this object is non-zero.
Therefore, we classify A3558 as a CC cluster in this work, in
line with the CC classiﬁcation for this object by dP07. M11
provides mean (emission-weighted) temperatures within an
annulus of 0.06 − 0.3 r180. As mentioned in §A.1.2, cluster
A3627 is classiﬁed as a NCC cluster.

Iron abundances within the 0.03 − 0.06 r180 annulus are
taken from their table 2 and converted from the photospheric
abundances of Lodders (2003) originally used to those of
Grevesse & Sauval (1998). The cluster iron abundance pro-
ﬁles we use to obtain ¯ZFe,500 are ﬁt to the stacked M11 data,
so we can expect them to be a particularly good representa-
tion of the typical iron abundance gradients in this sample.

A.1.7 Cluster sample T -ZFe relations

Fig. 15 shows the kT500 - ¯ZFe,500 relations for each of the
cluster samples described above.

The three samples on the left of Fig. 15 exhibit clear
negative correlations between T and ZFe. Simple linear ﬁts
to each of these three samples above log(kT500/keV) = 0.25
yield slopes ranging from -0.23 (dP07 sample) to -0.39 (P03
sample). These are comparable to the slope of -0.26 obtained
for the complete dataset. The three samples on the right of
Fig. 15 exhibit ﬂatter relations however, with slopes ranging
from -0.03 (DGM01 sample) to -0.17 (T04 sample).

We note that the T04 relation would become steeper
if we were to assume the steeper iron abundance proﬁles
they measure for their NCC clusters, as discussed in §A.1.4.
The very ﬂat T -ZFe relation for the DGM01 sample origi-
nates from the original mean, emission-weighted iron abun-
dances, which also have no clear correlation with T500. How-
ever, De Grandi et al. (2004) have found a slight negative
slope for the same set of clusters when considering the
additional information on the ICM gas mass provided by
Ettori, De Grandi & Molendi (2002) to obtain MFe/Mgas
within r2500 and r1000 (see e.g. their ﬁg. 8).

We therefore conclude that a slight negative slope is a
common feature of the T -ZFe relation, which at least war-
rants further discussion (§3.1).

spectra of 7 galaxy groups and 1 galaxy cluster (A2634),
originally from the ROSAT RASSCALS catalogue. All 8

Figure 16. A comparison of the mass-weighted iron abundances
obtained from the iron masses provided by RP09 and our Eqn. A1
(brown), with those obtained by correcting the emission-weighted
iron abundances provided by Rasmussen & Ponman (2007) using
our default group ZFe proﬁle (§2.4) (black).

Figure 17. Iron abundance proﬁles for three groups from the S14
sample: HCG62, NGC1550, and NGC5044. Yellow points indicate
radial data measured by S14. Yellow lines are ﬁts to the data using
Eqn. 11 and treating xc and α as free parameters. Brown lines are
ﬁts to the data using the same equation and ﬁxing xc and α to
their default values for groups, as given in Table 2. Proﬁles have
been rescaled to r180 in this ﬁgure, assuming r500 = 0.64 r180.

can be used in our analysis, of which 1 is NCC. M05 mea-
sured (emission-weighted) mean ICM temperatures between
0.1 r500 and 0.5 r500.

Iron abundances were measured within the same an-
nulus, and are corrected from the photospheric abundances
of Anders & Grevesse (1989) originally used to those of
Grevesse & Sauval (1998). We note that group NRGb184
exhibits a particularly low iron abundance within the mea-
sured annulus of only log( ¯Z0.1−0.5r500 ) = −1.0. A similarly
low value was also found by Johnson et al. (2011), who
attributed it to member galaxies ejecting an usually low
amount of metals into the ICM for their stellar mass. How-
ever, Johnson et al. (2011) also determined that the iron
abundance gradient in NRGb184 is eﬀectively ﬂat (their ﬁg.
3), in contrast to typical CC groups. Based on this infor-
mation, we make an exception for NRGb184, and assume
a ﬂat abundance gradient when calculating ¯ZFe,500 rather
than the default Rasmussen & Ponman (2007) proﬁle used
for other groups.

Values of the gas-density slope, β, were not obtainable
for four of the M05 groups, A194, NGC3411, NRGb184, and
NGC5098. In these cases, we estimate β from the ICM tem-
perature, as is done for our model groups and clusters, via
the ¯Tew-β relation provided by Sanderson et al. (2003) given
by Eqn. 17. Similarly, we assume rc is equal to the scale
length, a = r200/c, for all M05 objects, except for the clus-
ter A2634, for which a measurement of rc is provided by
Reiprich & B¨ohringer (2002).

A.2.2 F06 (Finoguenov et al. 2006b)

Finoguenov et al. (2006, hereafter F06) studied archival
data of 11 galaxy groups from the XMM-Newton Group Sur-
vey (2dXGS). We choose to take values of ¯Tmw and ¯ZFe from
their 0.1 − 0.5r500 annulus, to be in better correspondence
with the proﬁle ﬁts we are using here. This leaves 6 groups
available for our analysis, of which 1 is NCC. NGC4168 is
excluded, as F06 estimate zero metallicity within this annu-
lus. NGC4168 is, in fact, another object which Johnson et al.
(2011) determine to be unusually ineﬃcient at polluting the
ICM with metals for its stellar mass (§A.2.1). Iron abun-
dances for the F06 sample were corrected from the photo-
spheric abundances of Anders & Grevesse (1989) originally
used to those of Grevesse & Sauval (1998).

For one group, NGC4261, values for β and rc could
not be obtained. Therefore, as for those cases in the M05
sample, β is inferred from the ICM temperature and we
assume rc = a.

A.2.3 RP09 (Rasmussen & Ponman 2009)

Rasmussen & Ponman (2009, hereafter RP09)
studied
Chandra data of 14 groups (1 NCC) and 1 cluster to ob-
tain iron, silicon, and total gas masses within r500 (their
table 1). This was achieved by assuming a β-model gas den-
sity proﬁle and the abundance gradient measurements from
their previous work, Rasmussen & Ponman (2007). We use
these masses to directly obtain ICM iron abundances as fol-
lows;

fH = [1 − Y⊙ − (Z⊙ · ¯Z0.1−0.3r500 )], where we assume the
solar fraction of helium, Y⊙, and use the average metallicity
measured by Rasmussen & Ponman (2007) between 0.1 and

nulus.

solar abundances

These RP09 mass-weighted iron abundances utilise ra-
dial proﬁles that have been individually ﬁt to each object,
and so provide a good benchmark with which to compare the
iron abundances obtained using our default group proﬁle.
In Fig. 16, we directly compare the iron abundances derived
from the RP09 iron masses (brown), with those obtained us-
ing our homogenisation process and the emission-weighted
iron abundances provided by Rasmussen & Ponman (2007)
for the same systems (black). We can see that the values are
very similar in most cases, further indicating that our ho-
mogenisation process is working well at producing realistic
mass-weighted iron abundances. We note that those objects
which show a larger discrepancy in Fig. 16 (i.e. NGC5846,
NGC2300, HCG62, and NGC1407) all have lower emission-
weighted metallicities (from Rasmussen & Ponman 2007)

than mass-weighted metallicities (obtained from the RP09
iron masses). Our homogenisation process is unable to repro-
duce such surprising cases, as the emission-weighted measure
will always be larger than the mass-weighted measure.

As noted in §2.1, measurements of rc and β compiled
by RP09 an Mulchaey et al. (2003) are used for all our
group samples where possible. An exception to this rule
is NGC533, for which a particularly high error on rc is
quoted by RP09 [rc = 2.2 h−1
73 kpc],
and only an upper limit of rc < 2.15 h−1
73 kpc is provided
by Mulchaey et al. (2003). In this case, we rely on the
more recent measurements of Gu et al. (2012), which give
rc = 1.64 h−1

73 kpc and σ(rc) = 1.7 h−1

73 kpc and σ(rc) = 0.10 h−1

73 kpc.

A.2.4 S14 (Sasaki, Matsushita & Sato 2014)

Sasaki, Matsushita & Sato (2014, hereafter S14) analysed
Suzaku data of 4 galaxy groups (all CC) which had been ob-
served out to ∼ 0.5 r180. For two of these groups, NGC1550
and NGC5044, we individually ﬁt iron abundance proﬁles
of the form given by Eqn. 11, using radial abundance data
kindly provided by T. Sasaki (priv. comm.), which is calcu-
lated assuming a two-temperature (2T) model. We allow all
three parameters in the ZFe proﬁle (namely, ZFe,0, xc, and
α) to be simultaneously ﬁt. A comparison between these
individual ﬁts, our default group proﬁle ﬁts (i.e. with our
default values for xc and α), and the original S14 data are
shown in Fig. 17.

For HCG62 (top panel of Fig. 17), we choose to rely
on our default group proﬁle ﬁt (brown line), as the individ-
ual ﬁt for this cluster is strongly biased by the outermost
radial measurement, which is surprisingly high. Our default

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

Iron in groups & clusters

25

group proﬁle, normalised to ZFe,0 as described in §2.4, is a
much closer match to the other three data points, and so
is preferred here. We also rely on our default group proﬁle
for MKW4, as not enough radial information is provided to
individually constrain xc and α for this object.

All abundances were corrected from the photospheric
abundances of Lodders (2003) originally used to those of
Grevesse & Sauval (1998). Mean, emission-weighted tem-
peratures are taken from the RP09 sample, which also con-
tains these 4 objects. Redshifts and structural parameters
are also available for all of the S14 groups from the stan-
dard catalogues mentioned in §2.1.

Table 6.
. . . completion of Table 4. NOTES: Column 1: System name (with other common alternative names in parenthesis). Column
2: Classiﬁcation as a group (Gr) or cluster (Cl), as deﬁned in §2.1. Column 3: Core type as deﬁned in §2.1, being either cool-core (CC)
or non-cool-core (NCC). Column 4: Original sample (Appendix A). Column 5: ICM temperature at r500, in keV. Column 6: Error in
kT500. We note that errors on the measured mean, emission-weighted ICM temperature are not provided by T04 or M11. Therefore, in
these cases, the propagated error on T500 is not known. Column 7: Mean, mass-weighted iron abundance within r500, in ZFe,⊙, assuming
the solar abundances of Grevesse & Sauval (1998). Column 8: Error in ¯ZFe,500.
