ORBITAL STABILITY OF SOLITARY WAVES FOR DERIVATIVE

NONLINEAR SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION

SOONSIK KWON AND YIFEI WU

Abstract. In this paper, we show the orbital stability of solitons arising in the cubic
derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations. We consider the zero mass case that is not
covered by earlier works [8, 3]. As this case enjoys L2 scaling invariance, we expect the
orbital stability in the sense up to scaling symmetry, in addition to spatial and phase
translations. For the proof, we are based on the variational argument and extend a similar
argument in [21]. Moreover, we also show a self-similar type blow up criteria of solutions
with the critical mass 4π.

1. Introduction

We study the orbital stability of soliton solutions arising in the nonlinear Schr¨odinger

equation with derivative (DNLS):

( i∂tu + ∂2
xu = i∂x(|u|2u),
u(0, x) = u0(x) ∈ H 1(R).

t ∈ R, x ∈ R,

(1.1)

The well-posedness for the equation (1.1) is intensive studied. Especially, it was proved
by Hayashi and Ozawa [9, 10, 11, 16] the local well-posedness in H 1(R) and the global well-

that for the focusing quintic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. There are many low regularity
local and global well-posedness results [17, 18, 4, 5, 12, 7, 14, 13]. Recently, Wu [20, 21]

posedness when the initial data satisﬁes RR |u0(x)|2 dx < 2π. The results are analogous to
showed that global well-posedness holds as long asRR |u0(x)|2 dx < 4π. In [21] the author

observed that the threshold 4π corresponds to the mass of a ground state. This observation
draws our attention to study the orbital stability or instability of soliton solutions with the
critical mass 4π.
As is shown in [8, 3], the equation (1.1) has two parameter family of solitons of the form

The orbital stability of those solitons was proved in [8] for c < 0 and c2 < 4ω and in [3] for
any c2 < 4ω. Here, the orbit is given by the phase and spatial translation. See [15] for the
related studies.
In this work, we consider the endpoint case, c2 = 4ω. It is called the zero mass case in view
of (1.2). Let W be a ground state of the elliptic equation

One may observe that E(R) = P (R) = 0 and M (R) = 4π. Similarly, we denote Rλ(t, x) =
2 R(λ2t, λx). Then Rλ is also a solution to (1.1). As opposed to the case of c2 < 4ω,
λ
the conservation laws do not restrict rescaling of solutions. Thus, our main theorem of the
orbital stability includes scaling parameter, in addition to the phase and spatial translation.

Theorem 1. For any ε > 0, there exists a δ = δ(ε) such that if

(1.5)
then for any t ∈ I = (−T∗, T ∗) (the maximal lifespan), there exist θ(t) ∈ [0, 2π), y(t) ∈ R,
and λ(t) ∈ [λ0,∞) for some constant λ0 > 0, such that

ku0 − R(0)kH 1 ≤ δ,

ku(t) − eiθRλ(t,· − y)kH 1 ≤ ε.

Moreover, from an extension of our argument we can also show a self-similar type blow-up
criteria of solutions with the critical mass, which is equal to that of the ground state W .
Theorem 2. Let u0 ∈ H 1(R) with ku0kL2 = kWkL2. Suppose that the solution u to (1.1)
blows up in the ﬁnite time T ∗, then there exist θ(t) ∈ [0, 2π), y(t) ∈ R, such that when
t → T ∗,

We provide the proof of Proposition 1 in Section 2. We use the fact that W is an optimal
function of a sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality (see [1]),

9 . Roughly speaking,
where we denoted CGN to be the sharp constant: CGN = 3
Proposition 1 tells that if a function closely attains the equality of the sharp Gagliardo-
Nirenberg inequality (1.9), then it is close to W up to the symmetries of spatial, phase
translation and scaling.

The strategy to prove Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 is a variational argument. In addition, we
combine it with the argument in [21]. To do this, we use the following gauge transformation.
Let

v(t, x) := e− 3

and

kv(t)kL6 ≥ ε0 for any t ∈ I.

This is done by a rigidity theorem (Proposition 1). Under this fact, we use a similar
argument in [21] to show that f (t) := kv(t)k4
3 π. This almost ﬁx
the ratio between kv(t)kL4 and kv(t)kL6 . Then we use the conservation laws, to establish the
relationships between kv(t)kL4 ,kv(t)kL6 and kvx(t)kL2 . Then after suitable transformations,
the solution almost attains the equality of the sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg (1.9). Using
Proposition 1, we conclude main theorems.
In Section 2, we prove Proposition 1 and in Section 3, we prove Theorem 1 and 2.

2. Proof of Proposition 1

First, we recall the uniqueness of the non-trivial solution for (1.3). Indeed, the non-
trivial solution for (1.3), which vanishes at inﬁnity, is uniqueness up to the rotation and the
spatial transformations.

4

SOONSIK KWON AND YIFEI WU

Lemma 1. If w ∈ H 1(R) \ {0} is a solution for (1.3), then there exists (θ, x0) such that

w(x) = eiθW (x − x0).

Proof. See for example Berestycki and Lions [2] for the standard argument.

(cid:3)

If w is the solution of (1.3), we have K(w) = 0. Indeed, it follows from integrating

against 1

2 w − x∂xw on the both side of (1.3) and then integration. Furthermore, set

d := inf{S(φ) : φ ∈ H 1(R) \ {0}, K(φ) = 0}.

(2.1)

Then d ≤ S(W ) due to K(W ) = 0.
Moreover, using the fact K(φ) = 0, we claim that d > 0. If we assume that d = 0, then
there exists a sequence {gn}∞

n=1 ⊂ H 1(R) \ {0}, such that
K(gn) = 0,

and

S(gn) → 0.

This gives

L6 → 0.

Hence, by interpolation, there exists N0, such that n ≥ N0,

kgnkL∞ ≤ 1.

Now by the deﬁnition of K, for n ≥ N0,

0 = K(gn) =Z (cid:0)6|gn|4 − |gn|6(cid:1) dx =Z |gn|4(cid:0)6 − |gn|2(cid:1) dx

≥Z |gn|4(cid:0)6 − 1(cid:1) dx = 5Z |gn|4 dx.

That is,R |gn|4 dx = 0. This implies that gn ≡ 0. This contradicts with gn 6= 0. Hence, we

conclude d > 0.

Next, we shall prove that W is the unique minimizer (up to symmetries) which attains
d. First of all, we prove the existence of the minimizer.
Proposition 2. For any sequence {gn} ⊂ H 1(R) satisfying that
as n → ∞,

S(gn) → d, K(gn) → 0,

there exists a function G, such that

In particular, S(G) = d, and K(G) = 0.

gn → G in ˙H 1(R).

Proof. By the proﬁle decomposition with respect to H 1 Sobolev embedding (see [6] for
example), there exist sequences {V j}∞

we have λ < 1 and K(λf ) = 0. Then from the deﬁnition of d, we have S(λf ) ≥ d. However,

Since λ < 1, this contradicts with (2.9). Thus we obtain the lemma.

or

(2.13)

However, S(gn) → d and d > 0, so there exists exactly one j, say j = 1, such that

S(V 1) = d,

and V j = 0 for other j ≥ 2. Since K(V 1) = 0, we obtain the minimizer G = V 1 which
attains d. Moreover, from (2.10) and (2.11), we ﬁnd that the remainder term Rn (since
L = 1, we may omit the superscript L),

Thus we close the proof of the proposition.

As mentioned before, d ≤ S(W ). In fact, we have the equality.
Lemma 3. d = S(W ).

Proof. Consider the set

M := {φ ∈ H 1(R) \ {0} : S(φ) = d, K(φ) = 0}.

(2.14)
Then by Proposition 2.1, M 6= ∅. By the Lagrangian multiplier, there exists λ, such that
for any φ ∈ M, such that
(2.15)
Testing a function ψ = 1

S′(φ) = λK ′(φ).

2 φ − xφx, we have

S′(φ)ψ = λK ′(φ)ψ.

(2.16)

On one hand, since S′(φ) = 2(−∂xxφ + |φ|2φ − 3

16|φ|4φ), we have

Thus S′(φ)ψ = 0 for any φ ∈ M. On the other hand, K ′(φ) = 24|φ|2φ − 6|φ|4φ, gives that

Thus, for any φ ∈ M, K ′(φ)ψ = −6RR |φ|4 dx 6= 0. Therefore, from (2.16), we obtain

that λ = 0. Thus, (2.16) yields that S′(φ) = 0. Hence, using Lemma 2.1, we obtain that
φ = eiθW (· − x0) for some θ, x0 ∈ R and thus d = S(W ). This proves the lemma.
(cid:3)

SOLITARY WAVE SOLUTIONS FOR DNLS

From the proof of Lemma 3, we obtain

M = {φ ∈ H 1(R) \ {0} : S(φ) = S(W ), K(φ) = 0}

= {eiθW (· − x0) : θ ∈ R, x0 ∈ R}.

This rigidity implies that the function G obtained in Proposition 2 is equal to eiθW (· − x0)
for some θ, x0 ∈ R. Therefore, we conclude Proposition 1 from Proposition 2.

3. Proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2

We ﬁrst prove Theorem 1.

Instead of proving Theorem 1, we give a slightly more
general result. This will be more useful in the proof of Theorem 2. To this end, we study
the solution to (1.11). We rewrite conservation laws in terms of v(t) variable.

Theorem 3. For any ε > 0, there exists a δ = δ(ε) such that if

E(v0) = O(δ), P (v0) = O(δ),

and M (v0) = M (W ) + O(δ),

(3.4)

then the result in Theorem 1 holds.

It is obvious that (1.5) implies (3.4). Hence Theorem 1 is a consequence of Theorem 3.
Let ε > 0 be given. We ﬁrst claim the following important lemma.

Lemma 4. Let ε0 be the constant in Proposition 1. Under the assumption in Theorem 3,
for suﬃciently small δ > 0, we have

Before giving the proof of the lemma, we provide a preliminary setting. To simplify notations
regarding to the functional S, we set

kv(t)kL6 ≥ ε0.

E0 = E(v0), P0 = P (v0), M0 = M (v0).

Then under the assumption (3.4), we have

E0, P0 = O(δ),

and M0 = M (W ) + O(δ),

where O(δ) → 0 as δ → 0.
We deﬁne the function w by

w(t, x) := e−it+ixv(t, x − 2t),

w0 = eixv0.

Then the assumption (1.5) becomes

kw0 − WkH 1 ≤ δ.

Next, we claim that for any t ∈ I,

To prove (3.14), for a contradiction, we assume there exists a time t0 such that the negation

Since kv(t)kL6 ≥ ε0, by (3.15), we ﬁnd that

Now we use the scaling argument, let λ(t) = kWkL6/kv(t)kL6 , and

Then from Lemma 4, λ ≤ ε0kWkL6, and
kvλ(t)k6

L6 = 96π; .

Since f (t) is scaling invariant, i.e.

Let w(t, x; λ) be deﬁned as

Then

M(cid:0)w(λ)(cid:1) =M (vλ) = M (v) = M0;
eP(cid:0)w(λ)(cid:1) =P (vλ) = λP (v) = λP0;
eE(cid:0)w(λ)(cid:1) =E(vλ) = λ2E(v) = λ2E0.

By the mass conservation law, we further obtain

(θ,y)∈R2(cid:13)(cid:13)w(λ) − eiθW (· − y)(cid:13)(cid:13) ˙H 1 < ε.
(θ,y)∈R2(cid:13)(cid:13)w(λ) − eiθW (· − y)(cid:13)(cid:13)H 1 < ε.

inf

Thus, by (3.19) and (1.10), we prove that

ku(t) − eiθRλ(t,· − y)kH 1 ≤ ε.

This proves Theorem 3.

Proof of Theorem 2.
Set λ(s) = k∂xWkL2/k∂xv(s)kL2 , and

v[s](t, x) = λ(s)

Then by the conservation laws of v, we have

1

2 v(cid:0)λ(s)2t, λ(s)x(cid:1).

E(v[s](t)) =E(v[s](0)) = λ(s)2E(v0),
P (v[s](t)) =P (v[s](0)) = λ(s)2P (v0),
M (v[s](t)) =M (v[s](0)) = M (v0).

So under the assumption of Theorem 2, if the solution v to (1.11) blows up in the ﬁnite
time T ∗, then k∂xv(s)kL2 → ∞ as s → T ∗. Thus, we have
λ(s) → 0, as s → T ∗.

Hence, when s → T ∗,

E(v[s](0)), P (v[s](0)) → 0, and M (v[s](0)) = M (W ).

This implies from Theorem 3 that there exist θs(t) ∈ [0, 2π), ys(t) ∈ R, andeλs(t) ∈ [λ0,∞)
such that when s → T ∗,
u[s](t) − eiθs(t)Reλs(t)(t,· − ys(t)) → 0 in H 1(R),
uniformly in t. Moreover, eλs(s) = 1. In particular, when t = s, we have
u[s](s) − eiθs(s)R(s,· − ys(s)) → 0 in H 1(R).

In view of (3.25), we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 2.
