AN IMPROVED EXACT INVERSION FORMULA FOR CONE

BEAM VECTOR TOMOGRAPHY

ALEXANDER KATSEVICH, DIMITRI ROTHERMEL AND THOMAS SCHUSTER

Abstract. In this article we present an improved exact inversion formula for
the 3D cone beam transform of vector ﬁelds. It is well known that only the
solenoidal part of a vector ﬁeld can be determined by the longitudinal ray trans-
form of a vector ﬁeld in cone beam geometry. The exact inversion formula, as
it was developed in A. Katsevich and T. Schuster, An exact inversion formula
for cone beam vector tomography, Inverse Problems 29 (2013), consists of two
parts. the ﬁrst part is of ﬁltered backprojection type, whereas the second part
is a costly 4D integration and very ineﬃcient. In this article we tackle this
second term and achieve an improvement which is easily to implement and
saves one order of integration. The theory says that the ﬁrst part contains all
information about the curl of the ﬁeld, whereas the second part presumably
has information about the boundary values. This suggestion is supported by
the fact that the second part vanishes if the exact ﬁeld is divergence free and
tangential at the boundary. A number of numerical tests, that are also subject
of this article, conﬁrm the theoretical results and the exactness of the formula.

1. Introduction

[Df ](cid:0)y(s), Θ(cid:1) =

f(cid:0)y(s) + tΘ(cid:1) · Θ dt, Θ ∈ S2.

∞(cid:90)

We consider the problem of reconstructing a smooth vector ﬁeld f , supported in

the open unit ball B3 = {x ∈ R3 : |x| < 1} ⊂ R3, from its cone beam data

(1.1)

0

Here y(s), s ∈ Λ ⊂ R, denotes a parametrization of the source trajectory Γ ⊂
(R3\B3) and S2 := ∂B3 is the unit sphere in R3. It is assumed that Θ ∈ C, where
C is a cone and that B3 ⊂ y(s) +C, i.e. the unit ball is completely contained inside
the union of the rays emanating from any source position y(s). The cone beam
transform (1.1) is the mathematical model of vector tomography, where a ﬂow ﬁeld
f is reconstructed from ultrasound Doppler or time-of-ﬂight measurements with
sources located on the trajectory Γ, see e.g.
[SSLP95, STL09]. It is well known
that D has a non-trivial null space and that only the solenoidal part f s of f can be
reconstructed from Df [Sha94].

In [KS13] the authors obtained the ﬁrst explicit and theoretically exact inversion
formula for the cone beam transform of vector ﬁelds, which is not based on series
expansions. The formula gives an analytical expression for computing the solenoidal
part f s of f from Df . The inversion formula consists of two parts: f s = f1 + f2.

with β = β(s, x) = (x − y(s))/|x − y(s)| and Φ can be computed from the data
Df . The second part that computes f2 is much more complex and less eﬃcient. It
consists of a costly 4D integral over S2 × S2 and resembles the early approaches
to inverting the cone beam transform based on the Tuy and Grangeat formulas
[Gra91, KS94, ZCG94]. The main result of this paper is the development of an
eﬃcient formula for computing f2.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we obtain a new formula for com-
puting f2 in the case when the support of f is the unit ball. Then, in Section 3, we
outline an algorithm for computing f2 for general domains. The results of numerical
testing of the formula for f2 are presented in Section 4. Testing of the algorithm
for computing f2 for general domains will be the subject of future research.

and using the identity:

(2.2)

(p)](cid:48)(cid:48) = −(n + 1)(n + 2)C (3/2)
the second derivative of the Radon transform of f s is given by

Since y(2)

n+1,l(η) is orthogonal to the normal component R(nor)f of Rf (see [KS11]),
we can replace Rf s with R(tan)f s in (2.4). The latter is equal to R(tan)f , as follows
from the orthogonal expansions used in [KS11]. Here R(nor)f and R(tan)f are the
normal and tangential components of the Radon transform of f , respectively (cf.
[KS11, KS13]):

(2.5)
[R(nor)f ](p, η) := (η · [Rf ](p, η))η, [R(tan)f ](p, η) := [Rf ](p, η) − [R(nor)f ](p, η).

we used the addition theorem for spherical harmonics. The operator in (2.8) acts
on vectors by computing the dot product of an input vector with ∇ηPn+1(α · η)
and then multiplying the result by the vector (2n + 3)α/4π.

In view of (2.11), any function given by (2.10) can be used in (2.9). The goal is
to choose the coeﬃcients ˇφn so we could use the following identity (see 5.10.2.2 in
[PBM88]), which we write here in a symmetric form:

2n + 1
n(n + 1)

Pn(s)Pn(t) = 2 ln 2 − 1 − ln(1 + |t − s| − st)

= 2 ln 2 − 1 − ln((1 + max(s, t))(1 − min(s, t))),

−1 < s, t < 1. In view of the relation (eq. 22.5.37 in [AS70])

Consider the integral with respect to p in (2.9). Deﬁne u(p) := ∂2

Surprisingly, the expression in brackets is exactly the same as the one occuring in
(3.26), (3.29) of [KS13]. The derivation (3.28)–(3.41) of [KS13] justiﬁes taking the
limit inside the integral in (2.16). Using (3.42) of [KS13] and ignoring the constant
terms because of the derivative in (2.16) gives:

Now we can ﬁnd the kernel K. Denote

v(η) :=

(2.19)
By assumption, v ∈ C∞(S2). Suppose ﬁrst that v is a linear combination of the
ﬁrst N0 vector spherical harmonics. Using (2.13), we can rewrite the integral in the

v(x) :=

˜KN (x, α; η)(Lηv)(η)dηdα,

(2.21)
with the diﬀerential operator (Lηv)(η) := (2η − ∇η) · v(η). Given that |Pn(t)| ≤ 1
and |Pn(t)| = O(n−1/2) uniformly on compact subsets of (−1, 1) (which follows
from the inequality 8.917.4 in [GR94]), we can take the limit as N → ∞ inside the
integral because the series is absolutely convergent as long as |x| < 1. Hence (2.12)
implies

(2.22) v(x) =

S2(α· x, α· η)(Lηv)(η)dηdα, S2(s, t) := − ln(1 +|t− s|− ts),

where we again ignored the constant terms because of the derivatives in (2.22).
Integration by parts in the sense of distributions converts Lη back into ∇η. Since
∇η = ∇ − (η · ∇)η, it is easy to check that for a diﬀerentiable function F deﬁned
on R we have ∇ηF (α · η) = F (cid:48)(α · η)(α − (α · η)η). Thus,

v(x) =

Equation (2.23) implies that v(x) is the result of applying a distribution, which
depends smoothly on the parameter x, to the test function (α − (α · η)η) · v(η) ∈
C∞(S2 × S2). Substitute s = α · x into the formula for ∂S2/∂t in (2.23). An easy
calculation shows that in the sense of distributions:

Combining (2.21)–(2.24) and (2.9) we obtain that the operator K is given by

K(x, η) = 2

(2.25)
Thus, the formal calculation in (2.9) is justiﬁed. For convenience, we replaced α · η
with α · x in (2.25). The two are equal on the support of the delta function.

Next we compute the kernel K explicitly. As is easily seen, K(x, η)η ≡ 0.
Introduce the coordinate system in which η = e3, and x lies in the e1, e3-plane.
This implies that the matrix K(x, η) has the following zero components: K13 =
K23 = K33 = 0.
The integral in (2.25) is over the great circle orthogonal to η − x. Consider two
points on that circle with the same ﬁrst coordinates. Clearly, the third coordinates
of these two points will also be equal to each other, but they will have opposite
(i.e., equal in magnitude and of opposite signs) second coordinate. This implies
that K12 = K21 = K32 = 0.
To compute the remaining nonzero components K11, K22, K31, let µ denote the
angle between the vectors η and η − x. Let θ denote the polar angle in the plane
orthogonal to η − x. Denote also L := |η − x|. The points on the great circle are
parameterized as follows:

(cos µ cos θ, sin θ, sin µ cos θ), 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π.

(2.26)
Note that the term (α · η)η in the numerator in (2.25) does not contribute to the
components we need to calculate. Therefore, using the homogeneity of the delta-

As is easily checked, u := cos µe1 + sin µe3 is the unit vector perpendicular to η − x
and lying in the η, x-plane. Therefore,

Since u, ev, and e2 form an orthonormal triple,
(2.35)

(h · e1)u + (h · e2)e2 = h − (h · ev)ev − (h · (u − e1))u.

Combining (2.9), (2.25), (2.32), (2.33), (2.34), the formula for f (2) becomes

A disadvantage of the formula (2.36) is that it appears to have non-smooth
dependence on x in a neighborhood of x = 0. Indeed, if x = 0, then a number of
vectors in (2.33) are undeﬁned. Thus, we rewrite (2.36) in a diﬀerent form. Observe
that Ψ(η) · η = 0. Hence the numerator in (2.36) can be written as follows:
(2.37)
Ψ(η) + (Ψ(η) · e1)(u − e1) = Ψ(η) +

3. General domains. Outline of argument.

Let D denote the convex domain where f is supported. The domain is supposed

to be known.

It is easy to see that

Indeed, by construction

for some scalar function ψ. Direct calculation shows that calculating the curl of

ALEXANDER KATSEVICH, DIMITRI ROTHERMEL AND THOMAS SCHUSTER

Observe that f (1)(x) can be represented in the form

(cid:90)

(3.3)

f (1)(x) =

[Ψ(η · x, η) − η(η · Ψ(η · x, η))]dη

S2

for some vector function Ψ. Direct calculation shows that ∇· of the integral in (3.3)
is zero, i.e. ∇ · f (1) = 0.
Consequently, f s(x) − f (1)(x) is a harmonic vector ﬁeld, i.e. f s(x) − f (1)(x) =
∇h(x) for some h such that ∆h ≡ 0. Here f s is the solenoidal part of f , and we
used (3.2) and that ∇ × f = ∇ × f s.
Once f (1)(x), x ∈ D, is computed, we can compute its cone beam transform
and subtract from the data. Since potential vector ﬁelds are in the kernel of
the cone beam transform, we can think that the measured data is the cone beam
transform of f s, not of f . Thus the subtraction gives the cone beam transform of
the harmonic vector ﬁeld f s(x)− f (1)(x) = ∇h, which we denote Dh(y(s), Θ). Here
y(s) and Θ are the position of the source and the direction of the ray, respectively.
Let xin(y(s), Θ) and xout(y(s), Θ) be the points where the ray determined by y(s)
and Θ enters the domain D and exists the domain D, respectively. Obviously,
h(xout(y(s), Θ)) − h(xin(y(s), Θ)) = Dh(y(s), Θ). Thus, we know the diﬀerences
between the values of h for many pairs of points (xin, xout) on the boundary. If the
collection of lines corresponding to our data Dh(y(s), Θ) is suﬃciently rich (which
is the case, for example, when the trajectory consists of two orthogonal circles),
then we can ﬁnd h on all the boundary of D up to a constant. Hence we can solve
the following boundary value problem: ∆h = 0 in D, h∂D = known, and then set
f (2) = ∇h. Since we compute the gradient, the fact that boundary values of h are
known only up to a constant does not aﬀect the computation of f (2).

4. Numerical experiments

We present some implementations of the improved inversion formula (1.2), (2.36).
We conﬁne ourselves to smooth vector ﬁelds f supported in the closed unit ball B3.
If a solenoidal vector ﬁeld f vanishes at the boundary in the sense of f (η)· η = 0 for
all η ∈ S2, then if follows that f (2) = 0, see also (3.1). For this reason, we assume
that the second part of the inversion formula f (2) mainly contains information about
boundary values. The numerical tests should emphasize this phenomenon as well
as the exactness of the formula. We mention that in contrast to f (1) we have to
evaluate Ψ(η) which is the most elaborate part of the inversion formula.

The ﬁrst vector ﬁeld we reconstruct is given as

fa(x) = ∇ × exp(−|x|2/2)



 x1

x2−x3

which is solenoidal and satisﬁes η · fa(η) = 0 on S2. Hence we expect f2 to be zero.
A plot of fa for x3 = −0.5 can be seen in ﬁgure 1 (left picture). The right picture
in ﬁgure 1 shows f (2) for this ﬁeld and in fact demonstrates that this part of the
inversion formula vanishes for fa up to discretization errors.

The second vector ﬁeld is given as

fb(x) =



x2

0

which is divergence free, either. A plot of fb for x3 = 0 is illustrated in ﬁgure 2.

Figure 2. The exact ﬁeld fb plotted in the plane x3 = 0

The visualization of f (2) in ﬁgure 3 for fb in fact demonstrates that its main
part is located close to the boundary of B3. the right picture in ﬁgure 3 shows the
absolute error (cid:107)fb − (f (1) + f (2))(cid:107) for x3 = 0. Again we see that the biggest part
of the error occurs at the boundary, a phenomenon which was observed in other
[Sch05]. The reasons for this are not entirely
measure geometries, too, see e.g.

clariﬁed. Besides discretization errors we think that numerical instabilities occur in
the integral of (2.36) for x being close to the boundary S2 = ∂B3. Numerical tests
showed that the articfacts close to the boundary appear also when computing f1.

The third vector ﬁeld is given by

fc(x) =

 .
cos(x2)

sin(x1)

0

Figure 4 shows fc plotted versus f (1) + f (2) and demonstrates a high concurrence.

Figure 5 presents plots of (cid:107)f (1)(cid:107) and (cid:107)f (2)(cid:107), respectively, in the plane x3 = 0.
A look at these plots clearly demonstrates that f (1) contains most information of
the interior values of fc, whereas f (2) has its largest values close to the boundary.
The absolute error (cid:107)fc − (f (1) + f (2))(cid:107) (Figure 6) shows again high accuracy with
discretization errors near ∂B3.

A plot of fd versus the reconstruction f (1) + f (2) is shown in ﬁgure 7.

Figure 8 shows plots of (cid:107)f (1)(cid:107) and (cid:107)f (2)(cid:107). These pictures again emphasize that
f (2) mainly contributes to the boundary values just as suggested by our theoretical
investigations. Figure 9 ﬁnally illustrates the accuracy of our inversion formula up
to discretization errors. Again the values close to the boundary are most sensible
with respect to errors.

5. Conclusions

We improved the exact inversion formula for cone beam vector tomography
achieved in [KS13] by saving one integration order in the second part f (2) of this
formula. Theoretical considerations suggest that the ﬁrst part of the formula, f (1),
which is of classical, ﬁltered backprojection type, contains information abut the
curl of f , whereas the second part f mainly contributes to the boundary values.
Consequently f (2) = 0 for a solenoidal vector ﬁeld with vanishing boundary values
f (η) · η = 0 on S2. These theoretical investigations as well as a good performance
of the inversion formula were supported by numerical experiments for diﬀerent di-
vergence free vector ﬁelds. Future work will address general convex domains and
the extension of the inversion formula to distributions.
