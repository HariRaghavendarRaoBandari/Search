PERTINENCY OF HOPF ACTIONS AND

QUOTIENT CATEGORIES OF COHEN-MACAULAY ALGEBRAS

Y.-H. BAO, J.-W. HE AND J. J. ZHANG

Abstract. We study invariants and quotient categories of ﬁxed subrings of
Artin-Schelter regular algebras under Hopf algebra actions.

0. Introduction

Artin-Schelter regular (or AS regular, for short) algebras [Deﬁnition 1.8] play
an important role in noncommutative algebraic geometry. We study some classes
of graded algebras that are closely related to AS regular algebras. In particular,
we are interested in algebraic and homological properties of ﬁxed subrings of AS
regular algebras under semisimple Hopf algebra actions, or geometrically, properties
of quotient singularities of noncommutative spaces under quantum group actions.
Some homological properties of Hopf actions on AS regular algebras were studied in
[KKZ1]. Finite dimensional Hopf actions on connected graded AS regular algebras
of global dimension two with trivial homological determinant were classiﬁed in
[CKWZ1]. In this paper we further investigate Hopf actions on AS regular algebras
and the correspondence quotient singularities in the noncommutative setting.

One of most interesting features in this area is the McKay correspondence. The
classical McKay correspondence connects many diﬀerent topics in mathematics such
as the ﬁnite subgroups of SU(2, C), Dynkin diagrams of ADE type, simple Lie
algebras, Kleinian singularities, G-Hilbert schemes and so on. See [Bu, Le1, Le2]
for very nice recent surveys and historical account. One ingredient in the classical
or commutative McKay correspondence is the Auslander Theorem [Au1, Au2] that
states that, if G is a ﬁnite small subgroup of GL(C⊕n) acting on R := C[x1, · · · , xn]
naturally, then there is a natural isomorphism of algebras

(E0.0.1)

R ∗ G ∼= EndRG (R).

Recall that a ﬁnite subgroup G ⊆ GL(V ), for a ﬁnite dimensional vector space V ,
is called small if G does not contain a pseudo-reﬂection of V .

Diﬀerent extensions and noncommutative versions of the McKay correspondence
have been proposed by several researchers [Ch, CKWZ2, Mor2, Le2, Wem] and
many nice results have been proven. In noncommutative algebraic geometry, AS
regular algebras are correct noncommutative analogues of the commutative poly-
nomial rings. One key ingredient in noncommutative McKay correspondence is the
Auslander Theorem when R is replaced by a noncommutative AS regular algebra.

It is desirable to prove the Auslander Theorem in a general noncommutative
setting. Some partial results can be found in [BHZ, CKWZ2, HVZ2, MU] and so
on, under some extra hypotheses. One of the main goals of this paper is to prove
a noncommutative version of the Auslander theorem that recovers the most of the
previous results and to provide some conjectures in this research direction.

Let A be an N-graded algebra over a base ﬁeld k of characteristic zero. We are
taking one step further by replacing the group G in (E0.0.1) by a Hopf algebra
H. Let H be a nontrivial semisimple Hopf algebra acting on A homogeneously
and inner faithfully [Deﬁnition 3.9]. Let A#H denote the smash product [Mon,
Deﬁnition 4.1.3]. Since H is semisimple, the left and the right integrals of H

coincide, and is denoted by R . The main dimension function we are going to use

here is the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension (also denoted by GK-dimension) – see [KL]
or Deﬁnition 1.1. A new invariant we introduce in this paper is the following.

Deﬁnition 0.1. Retain the above notation and suppose that GKdim A < ∞. The
pertinency of the H-action on A is deﬁned to be

p(A, H) = GKdim A − GKdim((A#H)/I)

where I is the 2-sided ideal of A#H generated by 1#R .

Fix an A and an H, diﬀerent H-actions on A result diﬀerent pertinency. This
means that p(A, H) is an invariant of the H-action on A, not just the pair (A, H).
When H is the group algebra kG, we write p(A, H) as p(A, G). If the H-action
on A was not inner faithful, then it is easy to check that p(A, H) = 0.
If H
acts on a domain A inner faithfully and A#H is prime,
it is automatic that
p(R, H) ≥ 1 (see Lemma 3.10). Note that p(A, H) = GKdim A (or equivalently,
GKdim((A#H)/I) = 0) if and only if A/AH is a right H ∗-dense Galois extension
in the sense of [HVZ2].

In part of the paper, we use Cohen-Macaulay property [Deﬁnition 1.4(3)] which is
a homological property in the noncommutative setting that is intimately connected
with the AS regularity. For example, all well-studied noetherian AS regular algebras
have been proven to be Cohen-Macaulay and it is conjectured that the Cohen-
Macaulay property is a consequence of the AS regularity.

Setup: For the rest of introduction, let R denote a noetherian, connected graded

AS regular, Cohen-Macaulay algebra of GK-dimension ≥ 2.

Deﬁnition 0.2. Suppose H is a Hopf algebra with integral R acting on R inner

faithfully, and let M be a ﬁnitely generated right R-module.

(1) The grade of M is deﬁned to be

j(M ) := min{i | Exti

R(M, R) 6= 0}.

If Exti

R(M, RR) = 0 for all i, then we say j(M ) = ∞.

(2) We say that the H-action on R is homologically small if j(R#H/(I)) ≥ 2,

where I is the 2-sided ideal generated by 1#R .

In the commutative (graded) case, homological smallness is equivalent to the
(usual) smallness [BHZ, Lemma 7.2]. Our ﬁrst result connects the noncommutative
Auslander theorem with the pertinency.

Theorem 0.3. Let H be a semisimple Hopf algebra acting on R inner faithfully
and homogeneously. Then the following are equivalent.

PERTINENCY AND QUOTIENT CATEGORIES

(1) p(R, H) ≥ 2.
(2) The H-action on R is homologically small.
(3) There is a natural isomorphism of algebras R#H ∼= EndRH (R).

Theorem 0.3 generalizes most of previous results concerning the noncommuta-
tive Auslander theorem in [CKWZ2, HVZ2, MU]. It is easier to manipulate the
condition on p(R, H) than to prove the isomorphism in Theorem 0.3(3) directly,
see [BHZ]. This is an advantage of Theorem 0.3. In Theorems 0.3 and 0.6, the
Cohen-Macaulay property is crucial while the AS regularity is hidden in the back-
ground. Then, in Theorem 0.7, the AS regularity is deﬁnitely needed. By the above
theorem, checking the hypothesis on the pertinency “p(R, H) ≥ 2” becomes essen-
tial. In some cases, the inequality p(R, H) ≥ 2 is checkable – see Theorem 0.5 and
[BHZ]. We do not have a general algorithm of calculating this number. However,
the following conjecture is expected.

Conjecture 0.4. Retain the hypotheses as in Theorem 0.3. Suppose the H-action
on R has trivial homological determinant in the sense of [KKZ1, Deﬁnition 3.3].
Then p(R, H) ≥ 2, or equivalently, the H-action on R is homologically small.

When R is the commutative polynomial ring and H is a ﬁnite group algebra, this
conjecture holds as a consequence of the classical Auslander theorem. In the non-
commutative setting, this has been veriﬁed in some special cases, but the conjecture
is open in general. If Conjecture 0.4 holds, then, by combining with Theorem 0.3,
we have the following version of the Auslander theorem: Retain the hypotheses as
in Theorem 0.3 and further assume that the H-action on R has trivial homological
determinant. Then R#H ∼= EndRH (R) naturally.

Note that the aim of paper [CKWZ2] is to establish a noncommutative McKay
correspondence for Hopf algebra actions on AS regular algebras of dimension two,
and one of the main results there is to verify Conjecture 0.4 when gldim R = 2.

As a consequence of Theorem 0.3, we have the following result. For any graded
algebra A, let Autgr(A) denote the group of all graded algebra automorphisms of
A. Suppose n ≥ 2 and let R := k−1[x1, · · · , xn] be the (−1)-skew polynomial ring
generated by x1, · · · , xn and subject to the relations xixj = −xjxi for all i 6= j.
Then Autgr(R) = (k×)n ⋊ Sn [KKZ2, Lemma 1.12(1)].

Theorem 0.5. Let σ be the automorphism of R := k−1[x1, · · · , xn] determined
by sending xi → xi+1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and xn → x1. Let G be the group
generated by σ. Then the homological determinant of the G-action on R is trivial
and p(R, G) ≥ 2. As a consequence, R ∗ G ∼= EndRG (R).

Theorem 0.5 answers a question of Ellen Kirkman [Ki], see also Question 5.9. In
contrast, when R is a commutative polynomial ring k[x1, · · · , xn] and G is generated
by the permutation sending xi → xi+1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and xn → x1, then

p(R, G) =(1

n = 2,
≥ 2 n > 2.

So, in the commutative case, G is not (homologically) small when n = 2, see [BHZ,
Examples 7.3 and 7.4] for further comments.

Going back to a general (graded) algebra A, we write Gr A for the category of
right graded A-modules, and gr A for the subcategory of ﬁnitely generated right

4

Y.-H. BAO, J.-W. HE AND J. J. ZHANG

graded A-modules. For any integer n, let Grn A (respectively, grn A) be the sub-
category of Gr A (respectively, gr A) consisting of objects with GK-dimension not
larger than n. Deﬁne the following quotient categories

QGrn B :=

Gr B
Grn B

and

qgrn B :=

gr B
grn B

.

When n = 0, the quotient category QGr0 B (respectively, qgr0 B) is just QGr B (re-
spectively, qgr B) deﬁned in noncommutative projective geometry [AZ] or Tails B
(respectively, tails B) used by other authors [MU, Ue, Mor1, Mor2].

Our ﬁrst result relating the pertinency and the quotient category is the following.

Theorem 0.6. Retain the hypotheses as in Theorem 0.3. Let α be an integer
≤ p(R, H). Then there is an equivalence of categories
qgrn−α RH ∼= qgrn−α R#H.

Since R is AS regular, R#H has ﬁnite global dimension. If, in addition, R is PI
(namely, R satisﬁes a polynomial identity), then the quotient category qgrn−α R#H
has ﬁnite global dimension. Under the extra PI hypothesis, by the above theorem,
qgrn−α RH has ﬁnite global dimension. When a connected graded algebra A is PI,
it is reasonable to deﬁne the dimension of the singular locus of A to be

dimsing(A) = min{i | qgri A has ﬁnite global dimension}.

Using this deﬁnition and assuming R is PI, we can bound the dimsing of the ﬁxed
subring RH by

dimsing(RH ) ≤ n − p(R, H) = gldim R − p(R, H).

(E0.5.1)
In particular, when p(R, H) = gldim R, RH has graded isolated singularities in the
sense of [Ue, Deﬁnition 2.2]. We give new examples of noncommutative graded
isolated singularities in Proposition 5.4. Following the idea of the noncommutative
crepant resolutions [Le2], R#H should be viewed a resolution of singularities of
RH. Some ideas in this paper are motivated by recent papers [CKWZ1, CKWZ2,
Le2, Mor1, Mor2, MU, HVZ2, Ue].

Another result concerning quotient categories is a version of BGG correspon-

dence. Let E be the graded algebra

E :=

Exti

R#H (S, S)

nMi=0

where S is a direct sum of all non-isomorphic graded simple right modules over
R#H concentrated in degree zero. Since R is Koszul, so is R#H. As a consequence,
E is Koszul. (All these are N-graded and locally ﬁnite.) Since R is AS regular, E is
Frobenius. Then the stable module category gr E is a triangulated category. Let M
be a ﬁnite dimensional right graded E-module. Take a minimal graded projective
resolution of M as follows

· · · −→ P −n −→ · · · −→ P 0 −→ M −→ 0.

is the least integer λ ≥ 0 such that
The complexity of M , denoted by c(M ),
dim P −n < a nλ−1 for almost all n, where a > 0 is a ﬁxed number. The complexity
of a module over a ﬁnite dimension algebra is an important invariant in studying
the representations of ﬁnite dimensional algebras [Ca, CDW, GLW]. Given any
nonnegative integer β, let Cβ be the full subcategory of gr E consisting of objects
M with c(M ) ≤ β.

PERTINENCY AND QUOTIENT CATEGORIES

Theorem 0.7. Retain the hypotheses as in Theorem 0.3 and assume further that
R is Koszul and that k is algebraically closed. Let β be a nonnegative integer.

(1) There is a canonical anti-equivalences of triangulated categories

Db(qgrβ R#H) ∼= gr E/Cβ.

(2) For any β ≥ n − p(R, H), there is an canonical anti-equivalence of triangu-

lated categories

Db(qgrβ RH) ∼= gr E/Cβ.

When H is a group algebra, one can deﬁne another invariant associated to the
G-action on R. Let now R be as in Theorem 0.7. Then the global dimension and
GK-dimension of R are the same. For any graded algebra automorphism g of R,
one can deﬁne the trace function T r(g, t) as in [KKZ2, Section 1].

Deﬁnition 0.8. Let g be a graded algebra automorphism of R of ﬁnite order and
let G be a ﬁnite subgroup of Autgr(R).

(1) The reﬂection number of g is deﬁned to be

r(g) = GKdim R − the order of the pole of T r(g, t) at t = 1.

(2) [KKZ3, Deﬁnition 2.2] g is called a quasi-reﬂection if r(g) = 1.
(3) [KKZ4, Deﬁnition 3.6(b)] g is called a quasi-bireﬂection if r(g) = 2.
(4) The reﬂection number of G-action on R is deﬁned to be

r(R, G) = min{r(g) | 1 6= g ∈ G}.

(5) G is called conventionally small if r(R, G) ≥ 2, or equivalently, G does not

contain any quasi-reﬂection.

Similar to p(R, G), r(R, G) is an invariant of the G-action on R, not of the pair
(R, G). The relation between p(R, G) and r(R, G) is not straightforward, and what
we are hoping for is the following conjectural inequality.

Conjecture 0.9. Retain the hypotheses as in Theorem 0.7. Let G be a ﬁnite
subgroup of Autgr(R). Then

(E0.8.1)

p(R, G) ≥ r(R, G).

This conjecture can be veriﬁed for some special cases [Theorem 5.7(4)].

If it
holds, then Conjecture 0.4 follows when H is a group algebra because r(R, G) ≥
2 when G-action has trivial homological determinant.
In fact, if Conjecture 0.9
holds, then, by combining with Theorem 0.3, we obtain the following: Retain the
hypotheses as in Theorem 0.7 and further assume that the G is conventionally small.
Then R ∗ G ∼= EndRG (R) naturally.

Combining (E0.5.1) with (E0.8.1) we have another conjecture

(E0.8.2)

dimsing(RG) ≤ gldim R − r(R, G).

The advantage of this conjectural inequality is that, in contrast to p(R, G),
the invariant r(R, G) is relatively easy to calculate. Note that (E0.8.1) can be
veriﬁed when R is AS regular of global dimension two following the classiﬁca-
tion of all such G-actions in [CKWZ1]. When the G-action on R has trivial
homological determinant, then p(R, G) (respectively, r(R, G)) would be either 2
or 3 and dimsing(RG) would be either 0 or 1. Understanding all possibilities of
{p(R, G), r(R, G), dimsing(RG)} in dimension three should be an interesting project.

This paper is organized as follows. We provide background material in Section
1. In Section 2, we prove a Morita type theorem for the equivalences of the quotient
categories. In Section 3, we consider semisimple Hopf actions on graded Cohen-
Macaulay algebras. We prove a generalized version of Theorem 0.3, and then give a
proof of Theorem 0.6. In Section 4, we establish a version of BGG correspondence
between the derived categories of quotient categories and the stable categories of
some Frobenius categories. In particular, we obtain Theorem 0.7. In Section 5, we
compute the pertinency of ﬁnite group actions on some special algebras, and give
a proof of Theorems 0.5.

1. Preliminaries

Throughout let k be a base ring that is a noetherian commutative domain. All
algebraic objects are over k. An algebra means an associative k-algebra that is
projective as a k-module. In Sections 4 and 5 (and part of Section 3) we further
assume that k is a ﬁeld. Let B be a (left and right) noetherian algebra. Usually
we are working with right B-modules. We write Mod B for the category of all right
B-modules, and mod B for the full subcategory of all ﬁnitely generated (or f.g. for
short) right B-modules.

Several results in this paper concern quotient categories of the module categories

deﬁned via a dimension function. For the purpose of this paper, a function

∂ : Mod B −→ R ∪ {±∞}

is called a dimension function if, for all f.g. B-modules M ,

(E1.0.1)

∂(M ) ≥ max{∂(N ), ∂(M/N )},

whenever N is a submodule of M . The ∂ is called an exact dimension function if
for all f.g. B-modules M ,

(E1.0.2)

∂(M ) = max{∂(N ), ∂(M/N )}

whenever N is a submodule of M . If M is not f.g., we extend the deﬁnition of ∂ by

(E1.0.3)

∂(M ) = sup{∂(N ) |

for all f.g. B-submodules N ⊆ M}.

By using (E1.0.3), equation (E1.0.2) holds for all B-modules M as well. Our
deﬁnition of a dimension function is weaker than the deﬁnition given in [MR, 6.8.4],
however, (E1.0.2) is the only property we will use.

For a k-module V , dim V denotes dimQ(V ⊗k Q) where Q is the fraction ﬁeld of

k. One special dimension function is the following

Deﬁnition 1.1. [KL, Deﬁnition 2.1] Let B be an algebra and M a right B-module.

(1) The Gelfand-Kirillov dimension or GK-dimension of B is deﬁned to be

GKdim B = sup

{ lim
n→∞

V

logn(dim V n) | f.g. k-submodules V ⊆ B}.

(2) The Gelfand-Kirillov dimension or GK-dimension of M is deﬁned to be
logn(dim W V n) | f.g. k-submodules V ⊆ B, W ⊆ M }.

GKdim M = sup
V,W

{ lim
n→∞

See [KL] and Remark 1.5 for basic properties of the GK-dimension.
In a major part of the paper the dimension function is chosen to be the Gelfand-
Kirillov dimension. However, a general dimension function will be useful when we

PERTINENCY AND QUOTIENT CATEGORIES

7

deal with the local setting in the sequel [BHZ] in which case the GK-dimension is
usually inﬁnite and does not work well.

From now on we ﬁx an exact dimension function ∂. Given an integer n ≥ 0, let
Modn B denote the full subcategory of Mod B consisting of right B-modules with
∂-dimension less than or equal to n, and let

modn B = Modn B \ mod B.

Since ∂ is exact on right B-modules, Modn B (respectively, modn B) is a Serre
subcategory of Mod B (respectively, mod B). Hence it makes sense to deﬁne the
quotient categories:

QModn B :=

Mod B
Modn B

,

and

qmodn B :=

mod B
modn B

.

We denote the natural projection functor by

π : Mod B −→ QModn B.

For M ∈ Mod B, we will write M for the object π(M ) in QModn B. The hom-set
of the objects in the quotient category is deﬁned by

HomQModn B(M, N ) = lim
−→

HomB(M ′, N ′)

for M, N ∈ Mod B, where M ′ is a submodule of M such that ∂(M/M ′) ≤ n,
N ′ = N/T for some submodule T with ∂(T ) ≤ n, and the direct limit runs over all
the pairs (M ′, N ′) with these properties.

Deﬁnition 1.2. Let A and B be noetherian algebras and ∂ be an exact dimension
function that is deﬁned on right A-modules and on right B-modules. Let n and i
be nonnegative integers. Let AMB denote one (or any) bimodule which is f.g. both
as a left A-module and as a right B-module.

(1) We say ∂ satisﬁes γn,i(M ) if for any N ∈ modn A, TorA

j (N, M ) ∈ modn B

for all 0 ≤ j ≤ i.

(2) We say ∂ satisﬁes γn,i if it satisﬁes γn,i(M ) for all M given as above.

In the next section we will be particularly interested in the γn,1 property.

Lemma 1.3. Let A and B be noetherian algebras such that ∂ is an exact dimension
function on both right A-modules and right B-modules. Assume that a bimodule
AMB is f.g. as a left A and as a right B-module and that ∂ satisﬁes γn,1(M ).

(1) The functor − ⊗A M induces a functor

− ⊗A M : qmodn A −→ qmodn B.

(2) The functor − ⊗A M induces a functor

− ⊗A M : QModn A −→ QModn B.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove (2).

For K ∈ Modn A, it is a direct limit of f.g. submodules. Since the direct limit
is an exact functor and, by assumption, ∂ is exact and satisﬁes γn,1(M ), we obtain
that ∂(K ⊗A M ) ≤ n and that ∂(TorA
1 (K, M )) ≤ n for all K ∈ Modn A. Let
f : U → V be a morphism in Mod A such that ker f and coker f are in Modn B.
By the right exactness of − ⊗A M , the cokernel of the right B-module morphism

f ⊗A M : U ⊗A M → V ⊗A M

8

Y.-H. BAO, J.-W. HE AND J. J. ZHANG

is in Modn B. Write f as the composition

f = h ◦ g : U

g
։ W

h
֒→ V.

Since ∂(TorA
1 (coker(f ), M )) ≤ n, by the long exact sequence associated to − ⊗A M ,
∂(ker(h ⊗A M )) ≤ n. Let X = ker f = ker g. Then ∂(X) ≤ n. We have an exact
sequence

X ⊗A M −→ U ⊗A M

g⊗AM
−→ W ⊗A M −→ 0

which induces the exact sequence

X ⊗A M −→ ker(f ⊗A M ) −→ ker(h ⊗A M ) −→ 0.

Since ∂ is exact, we see

∂(ker(f ⊗A M )) ≤ max{∂(X ⊗A M ), ∂(ker(h ⊗A M ))} ≤ n.

Hence f ⊗A M has its kernel and cokernel in Modn B. Therefore, − ⊗A M induces
a functor

− ⊗A M : QModn A −→ QModn B.

So we have proven part (2).

Since M is f.g. in both sides, this functor restricts to

− ⊗A M : qmodn A −→ qmodn B.

Therefore (1) follows.

We now recall a deﬁnition.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 1.4. Let B be an algebra and M a right B-module.

(2) [ASZ1, Deﬁnition 0.4] Let ∂ be a dimension function. We say B is ∂-Cohen-

Macaulay (or ∂-CM) if ∂(B) = d ∈ N, and

for every f.g. right B-module M 6= 0.

j(M ) + ∂(M ) = ∂(B),

(3) If B is GKdim-Cohen-Macaulay, we just say it is Cohen-Macaulay or CM.
(4) Let ∂ be an exact dimension function and ∂(B) = d ∈ N. Let s be a
nonnegative integer. We say B is ∂-CM(s) if, for every f.g right B-module
M ,

∂(M ) ≤ d − s ⇐⇒ j(M ) ≥ s.

The CM property together with the Artin-Schelter regularity and the Auslander
property (another homological property) has been studied in the noncommutative
setting in [ASZ1, ASZ2, SZ, YZ, Zh].

Remark 1.5. In parts (4,5), assume that k is a ﬁeld.

(1) The dimension function ∂ is exact on ∂-CM algebras [ASZ2, p. 3].
(2) GKdim is exact on ﬁltered algebras such that the associated graded algebras

are locally ﬁnite and noetherian [KL, Theorem 6.14].

(3) GKdim satisﬁes γn,0 for all n. Namely, for any N ∈ modn A, we have
in both sides. This follows

GKdim N ⊗A M ≤ n, assuming AMB is f.g.
from [KL, Proposition 5.6] by a slight modiﬁcation of the proof.

(4) For every f.g. module N , it is well-known that GKdim N = 0 if and only
if N is ﬁnite dimensional over k. Using this fact, one can easily check that
GKdim TorA
in both sides.
This means that GKdim satisﬁes γ0,i for all i.

i (N, M ) = 0 if GKdim N = 0 and AMB is f.g.

PERTINENCY AND QUOTIENT CATEGORIES

(5) Take ∂ = GKdim. As a consequence of part (4) and Lemma 1.3(2), the

functor

− ⊗A M : QMod0 A −→ QMod0 B

is always well-deﬁned.

Let B = Ln≥0 Bn be a noetherian graded algebra.

In this paper, a graded
algebra means an N-graded and a graded module means Z-graded. We call B
locally ﬁnite if each Bn has ﬁnite rank over k. We write Gr B for the category
of right graded B-modules, and gr B for the subcategory of f.g. right graded B-
modules. Let ∂ be an exact dimension function on graded right B-modules. Similar
to the nongraded case, we write Grn B (respectively, grn B) for the subcategory of
Gr B (respectively, gr B) consisting of objects with ∂-dimension not larger than n.
Similar to the deﬁnitions given in the introduction, we have quotient categories

QGrn B :=

Gr B
Grn B

and

qgrn B :=

gr B
grn B

.

We also use π : Gr B → QGrn B for the natural projection functor, and for M ∈
Gr B, we write M := π(M ).

If M is a f.g. graded right module over a noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebra

B, then its GK-dimension can be computed by [Zh, (E7)]

(E1.5.1)

GKdim M = lim
k→∞

logkXj≤k

dim(Mj).

The ith derived functor of the HomA(M, N ) in the graded category (respectively,

the graded M ⊗A N ) is denoted by Exti

A(M, N ) (respectively, TorA

i (M, N )).

Lemma 1.6. Let A and B be noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebras. Then GKdim
on graded modules satisﬁes γn,i for all n and i.

Proof. Let M be a graded A-B-bimodule such that M is f.g. on both sides. We
need to show that, for every f.g. graded right A-module N with GKdim N ≤ n, we
have GKdim TorA

i (N, M ) ≤ n for all i ≥ 0.

Since N is f.g., TorA

i (N, M ) is a graded f.g. B-module for each i ≥ 0. Let

· · · −→ Fn −→ · · · −→ F1 −→ F0 −→ M −→ 0

be a graded free resolution of the left graded A-module M . Since AM is f.g., we can
choose each Fi to be f.g.. By deﬁnition, TorA
i (N, M ) (forgetting the right B-module
structure) is a subquotient of N ⊗A Fi. Temporarily write T := TorA
i (N, M ) and
N := N ⊗A Fi. Since T is f.g. as a right graded B-module and, as a graded
k-module, T is a subquotient of N . By (E1.5.1), we have

Lemma 1.7. Let A and B be noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebras. Consider
∂ := GKdim. For any graded A-B-bimodule M that is f.g. on both sides, a graded
version of Lemma 1.3 holds. Namely, we have functors:

− ⊗A M : QGrn A −→ QGrn B,

and

− ⊗AM : qgrn A −→ qgrn B.

Proof. By Lemma 1.6, ∂ satisﬁes γn,i(M ) for all n and i and all M . The assertion
follows from a graded version of the proof of Lemma 1.3.
(cid:3)

To conclude this section we recall and introduce a couple of more deﬁnitions.
The notion of Artin-Schelter Gorensteinness was generalized to the nonconnected
graded case by several authors. We are going to use the following version. Let A
be a locally ﬁnite graded algebra such that A0 is semisimple.

Deﬁnition 1.8. [MM, RRZ] Let k be a ﬁeld. A locally ﬁnite graded algebra A
with A0 being semisimple is called Artin-Schelter Gorenstein (or AS Gorenstein) if
the following conditions hold:

(a) A has ﬁnite injective dimension d on both sides,
(b) Exti
(c) Extd
If moreover

A(A0, A) = Exti
A(A0, A) ∼= A0(l) and Extd

Aop (A0, A) = 0 for all i 6= d where A0 = A/A≥1, and

Aop (A0, A) ∼= A0(l) for some integer l.

(d) A has ﬁnite global dimension, and
(e) A has ﬁnite GK-dimension,

then A is called Artin-Schelter regular (or AS regular).

In [MM], the AS Gorensteinness does not require that A0 is semisimple. In the

introduction, R is connected graded AS regular.

When A is noetherian, connected graded and PI of ﬁnite global dimension, then
A is AS regular and CM [SZ, Theorem 1.1]. It is conjectured that every noetherian
connected graded AS regular algebra is CM.

Deﬁnition 1.9. Let R be a subalgebra of B and let ∂ be a dimension function
deﬁned on right R-modules and right B-modules.

(1) We say ∂ is weakly B/R-hereditary if ∂(MR) ≤ ∂(MB) for every f.g. right

B-module M .

(2) Suppose BR is f.g.. We say ∂ is B/R-hereditary if for every f.g.

right

B-module M , ∂(MR) = ∂(MB).

Lemma 1.10. Let R be a subalgebra of B.

(1) GKdim is always weakly B/R-hereditary.
(2) Suppose that R ⊆ B are noetherian and locally ﬁnite graded algebras such

that BR is f.g. Then GKdim is B/R-hereditary on graded right modules.

Proof. (1) This follows from Deﬁnition 1.1(2).

(2) Let M be a f.g. graded right B-module. Since BR is f.g., M is a f.g. R-
module. By (E1.5.1), GKdim M is only dependent on the Hilbert series of M , not
the module structure. Therefore GKdim MB = GKdim MR.

2. A Morita type Theorem

The main result of this section is Theorem 2.4. We consider the following hy-

potheses to be used in diﬀerent situations.

PERTINENCY AND QUOTIENT CATEGORIES

Hypothesis 2.1.

(1) A and B are noetherian algebras.

(2) Let e be an idempotent in B and A = eBe.
(3) ∂ is a dimension function deﬁned on right A-modules and B-modules and

∂(B) =: d ≥ 2.

(4) B is a ∂-CM(2) algebra.
(5) eB and Be are f.g. A-modules.
(6) ∂ is exact on right A-modules.
(7) For every f.g. right B-module N , ∂((N e)A)(= ∂(N ⊗B Be)) ≤ ∂(NB).

Under Hypothesis 2.1(2), Be is a right A-module and there is a natural algebra

morphism

(E2.1.1)

ϕ : B → EndA(Be), ϕ(b)(b′e) = bb′e

In this section we will investigate when this
induced by the left multiplication.
morphism ϕ is an isomorphism. A special case of this situation is the Auslander
theorem [Au1, Proposition 3.4].

We need use some weaker versions of CM condition. Let ∂ be a dimension

function and α be an integer.

(a) We say an algebra B is ∂-CMl(α) if

∂(M ) ≤ d − s =⇒ j(M ) ≥ s.

(b) We say an algebra B is ∂-CMr(α) if

∂(M ) ≤ d − s ⇐= j(M ) ≥ s.

Then B is ∂-CM(α) if and only if it is both ∂-CMl(α) and ∂-CMr(α).

Lemma 2.2. Let (A, B) satisfy Hypothesis 2.1(1,2,3) and α be an integer such that
0 < α ≤ d. Suppose that B is ∂-CMl(α). Let N be a f.g. right A-module. If
∂(TorA
A(N, Be) = 0 for all i ≤ α − 1.

i (N, eB)) ≤ d − α for all i ≤ α − 1, then Exti

Proof. We have canonical isomorphisms induced by the adjointness

HomB(N ⊗A eB, B) ∼= HomA(N, HomB(eB, B)) ∼= HomA(N, Be).

From these isomorphisms, we obtain a spectral sequence [Ro, Theorem 11.54]

i (N, eB)) ≤ d − α for all i ≤ α − 1. By (E2.2.1), we

In the next lemma it is not necessary to assume d ≥ 2.

Lemma 2.3. Let (A, B) satisfy Hypothesis 2.1(1-3),(5-7) and α be a positive inte-
ger. Suppose that

(E2.3.1)

∂ satisﬁes γd−α,1(eB).

If ∂(B/(BeB)) ≤ d − α, then the functor − ⊗B Be : qmodd−α B −→ qmodd−α A
is an equivalence.

12

Y.-H. BAO, J.-W. HE AND J. J. ZHANG

Proof. By hypothesis (E2.3.1), ∂ satisﬁes γd−α,1(eB). By Lemma 1.3, we have the
induced functor − ⊗A eB : qmodd−α A −→ qmodd−α B. Since Be is projective as
a left B-module, the hypothesis of Lemma 1.3 follows from Hypothesis 2.1(7) with
M = Be and A and B are switched. By Lemma 1.3, we have the induced functor
− ⊗B Be : qmodd−α B −→ qmodd−α A. For any N ∈ mod A, we have natural
isomorphisms in qmodd−α A:

N ⊗A eB ⊗B Be ∼= π(N ⊗A eB ⊗B Be) ∼= π(N ) = N .
Taking M ∈ mod B, we have natural isomorphisms in qmodd−α B:

M ⊗B Be ⊗A eB ∼= π(M ⊗B Be ⊗A eB).

We claim that π(M ⊗B Be ⊗A eB) = π(M ). Let f : Be ⊗A eB → B be induced by
the multiplication in B and factor f as f = hg with h a monomorphism and g an
epimorphism. Then we have two short exact sequences as follows,

(E2.3.2)

(E2.3.3)

0 → K → Be ⊗A eB

g
→ BeB → 0,

0 → BeB h→ B → B/BeB → 0.

Applying the functor − ⊗B Be to (E2.3.2), we obtain the exact sequence

0 → Ke → Be ⊗A eBe → Be → 0,

which results that Ke = 0. Similarly, eK = 0. Since Be is a f.g. right A-module,
Be ⊗A eB is a f.g. right B-module. Hence K is a f.g. B/BeB-bimodule. Since
∂(B/BeB) ≤ d − α, we have ∂(K) ≤ d − α. Consider the exact sequence

M ⊗B K → M ⊗B Be ⊗A eB → M ⊗B BeB → 0.

Since M ⊗B K is a f.g. B/BeB-module, ∂(M ⊗B K) ≤ d − α. Now we have
π(M ⊗B Be ⊗A eB) ∼= π(M ⊗B BeB) in qmodd−α B. From the exact sequence
(E2.3.3), we obtain an exact sequence

TorB

1 (M, B/BeB) → M ⊗B BeB → M → M ⊗B B/BeB → 0.

Since the ∂-dimension of B/BeB is not larger than d − α, neither are the ∂-
dimensions of M ⊗B B/BeB and TorB
1 (M, B/BeB). Hence we have natural iso-
morphisms in qmodd−α B: π(M ⊗B BeB) ∼= π(M ). Summarizing, we obtain

M ⊗B Be ⊗A eB ∼= π(M ⊗B Be ⊗A eB) ∼= π(M ) = M

as desired.

(cid:3)

A special case of Lemma 2.3 is the following well-known statement:

if e is an
idempotent in B such that BeB = B, then B is Morita equivalent to A := eBe.
Most of Hypothesis 2.1 is not necessary in this special case. Therefore Lemma 2.3
can be viewed as a generalization of Morita theorem. Specializing the last statement

to a semisimple H-action on an algebra A, if e := 1#R in B := A#H is such that

BeB = B, then AH is Morita equivalent to A#H, see [Mon, Corollary 4.5.4].

The main result of this section is the following Morita type theorem.

Theorem 2.4. Let (A, B) satisfy Hypothesis 2.1(1-7). Suppose

(E2.4.1)

∂ satisﬁes γd−2,1(eB).

Then the following statements are equivalent.

(i) The functor − ⊗B Be : qmodd−2 B −→ qmodd−2 A is an equivalence.

PERTINENCY AND QUOTIENT CATEGORIES

13

(ii) The natural map ϕ of (E2.1.1) is an isomorphism of algebras.
(iii) ∂(B/(BeB)) ≤ d − 2.
(iv) j(B/BeB) ≥ 2.

Proof. (i) =⇒ (ii). Let F = − ⊗B Be. Since F is an equivalence, we obtain
isomorphisms of algebras:

(E2.4.2)

Endqmodd−2 B B ∼= Endqmodd−2 A F (B) = Endqmodd−2 A π(Be).

By assumption, B is ∂-CMl(2). Hence, for M ∈ modd−2 B,

HomB(M, B) = 0 = Ext1

B(M, B).

As a consequence, BB does not contain any nonzero submodule of ∂-dimension at
most d − 2. Therefore, by deﬁnition,

Endqmodd−2 B B = lim
−→

HomB(K, B),

where the limit runs over all the right submodule modules K ⊆ B such that
∂(B/K) ≤ d − 2. For such a submodule K, we have

HomB(B/K, B) = 0 = Ext1

B(B/K, B).

Hence, a long exact sequence implies that HomB(K, B) = HomB(B, B) = B. Thus,
we have Endqmodd−2 B B ∼= B.

Let N ∈ modd−2 A. By Lemma 1.3(1) and (E2.4.1), the hypothesis of Lemma

2.2 concerning ∂(TorA

i (N, eB)) holds for α = 2. Hence, by Lemma 2.2,

(E2.4.3)

HomA(N, Be) = 0 = Ext1

A(N, Be)

for all N ∈ modd−2 A.
submodule of ∂–dimension ≤ d − 2. Using this and (E2.4.3), we have

In particular, Be does not have any nonzero right A-

Homqmodd−2 A(Be, Be) = lim
−→

HomA(K, Be) ∼= HomA(Be, Be),

where the limit runs over all the submodules K ⊆ Be such that ∂(Be/K) ≤ d − 2.
Combining with (E2.4.2), one sees that B ∼= HomA(Be, Be), and the isomorphism
is the natural morphism given in statement (ii).

(ii) =⇒ (iv). Let f : Be ⊗A eB −→ B be the B-bimodule morphism deﬁned
by f (be ⊗A eb′) = beb′, which was used in the proof of Lemma 2.3. Consider the
following composition of morphisms:

B = HomB(B, B)

HomB (f,B)

−→ HomB(Be ⊗A eB, B)

φ

−→ HomA(Be, HomB(eB, B)) α−→ HomA(Be, Be),

where φ is the natural isomorphism deﬁned by the adjointness, and α is the iso-
morphism induced by the isomorphism HomB(eB, B) ∼= Be. One sees that the
composition above is equal to the natural morphism

ϕ : B −→ EndA(Be), ϕ(b)(b′e) = bb′e.

By (ii), it is an isomorphism. Hence the morphism

HomB(f, B) : HomB(B, B) −→ HomB(Be ⊗A eB, B)

14

Y.-H. BAO, J.-W. HE AND J. J. ZHANG

is an isomorphism. Let us factor the morphism f as follows:

Be ⊗A eB

?⑧⑧⑧⑧⑧⑧⑧⑧

C,

where C = imf = BeB, g is the epimorphism induced by f and h is the in-
clusion map. Applying the functor HomB(−, B) to the diagram above, we have
HomB(f, B) = HomB(g, B) ◦ HomB(h, B). Since g is an epimorphism, it follows
that HomB(g, B) is a monomorphism, and hence it has to be an isomorphism, which
in turn implies that HomB(h, B) is an isomorphism. From the exact sequence

0 −→ C h−→ B −→ B/BeB −→ 0,

we obtain the following exact sequence

0 −→ HomB(B/BeB, B) −→ HomB(B, B)

HomB (h,B)

−→ HomB(C, B) −→ Ext1

B(B/BeB, B) −→ 0.
Since HomB(h, B) is an isomorphism, we obtain HomB(B/BeB, B) = 0 and
B(B/BeB, B) = 0. Hence j(B/(BeB)) ≥ 2.
(iv) =⇒ (iii) This follows from ∂-CMr(2).
(iii) =⇒ (i). This is a special case of Lemma 2.3 when α = 2.

(cid:3)

Ext1

Remark 2.5. We have the following observations concerning the proof of Theorem
2.4.

(1) In the proof of (i) =⇒ (ii), only ∂-CMl(2) is used (not the entire ∂-CM(2)).
(2) In the proof of (iv) =⇒ (iii), only ∂-CMr(2) is used (not the entire ∂-
CM(2)). In fact, we only used the fact that j(B/BeB) ≥ 2 implies that
∂(B/BeB) ≤ d − 2.

(3) In the proof of (iii) =⇒ (i), ∂-CM(2) is not needed.
(4) (iii) =⇒ (iv) Follows from the deﬁnition of ∂-CM(2).

Now let B =Li≥0 Bi be a noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebra. Let e ∈ B0

be an idempotent. Then A := eBe is a noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebra.
Following Deﬁnition 1.4, B is said to be graded CM if GKdim B = d < ∞ and
j(M ) + GKdim K = GKdim B for all f.g. graded right B-modules M .

Note that the GK-dimension is always exact on modules over noetherian locally
ﬁnite graded algebras [Remark 1.5(2)]. By Lemma 1.6, GKdim satisﬁes γn,i. Note
that, by (E1.5.1), GKdim satisﬁes Hypothesis 2.1(7) in the locally ﬁnite graded
case. Therefore we obtain the following graded version of Theorem 2.4.

Theorem 2.6. Let B = Li≥0 Bi be a noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebra.

Suppose (A, B) satisﬁes Hypothesis 2.1(1-5) in the graded setting with e ∈ B0 and
∂ = GKdim. Then the following statements are equivalent.

(i) The functor − ⊗B Be : qgrd−2 B −→ qgrd−2 A is an equivalence.
(ii) The natural map ϕ : B −→ EndA(Be) deﬁned by ϕ(b)(b′e) = bb′e is an

isomorphism of graded algebras.

(iii) GKdim B/(BeB) ≤ d − 2.
(iv) j(B/BeB) ≥ 2.

3. Hopf algebra actions on graded algebras

In this section we consider locally ﬁnite graded algebras and let ∂ be a dimension
function on locally ﬁnite graded modules. Starting from Proposition 3.3, we further
assume that k is a ﬁeld.

Let (H, ∆, ε, S) be a Hopf algebra that is free of ﬁnite rank over k. Let R be a
noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebra. Assume that R is a graded left H-module
algebra, i.e., H acts on R homogeneously. Then the smash product R#H is a
noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebra.

Suppose that H has a (left and right) integralR such that ε(R ) = 1. If k is a
ﬁeld, this is equivalent to the fact that H is semisimple. Let e = 1#R ∈ R#H.

One sees that e is an idempotent of R#H. Write the ﬁxed subring of the H-action
on R as

(E3.0.1)
Then RH is a graded subalgebra of R. The following is well-known [Mon].

RH = {r ∈ R | h · r = ε(h)r, ∀ h ∈ H}.

Lemma 3.1. With the notation as above. The following hold.

(1) RH is noetherian.
(2) R is f.g. as a left graded RH -module and as a right graded RH -module.
(3) The map RH −→ e(R#H)e, sending r 7→ e(r#1)e, is an isomorphism of

graded algebras.

(4) The map R −→ (R#H)e, sending r 7→ (r#1)e, is an isomorphism of graded

(R, RH )-modules.

(5) The map R −→ e(R#H), sending r 7→ e(r#1), is an isomorphism of graded

(RH , R)-modules.

Proof. (1) This follows by the proof of [Mon, Corollary 4.3.5].

(2) This follows by the proof of [Mon, Theorem 4.4.2].
(3,4,5) By direct computation.

(cid:3)

Hypothesis 3.2.

(1) R is a noetherian, locally ﬁnite, graded algebra.

(2) H is a Hopf algebra acting on R homogeneously, and H is free of ﬁnite rank

over k with integralR such that ǫ(R ) = 1.
(3) Let B be the algebra R#H with e := 1#R ∈ B. Identifying RH with eBe

by Lemma 3.1(3), R with Be by Lemma 3.1(5).

(4) Let ∂ be an exact dimension function on f.g. right graded B-modules, R-

modules, and RH -modules. This is automatic if ∂ = GKdim.

(5) ∂ is B/R-hereditary. This is automatic if ∂ = GKdim by Lemma 1.10(2).
(6) ∂(R) = d ≥ 2 and R is graded ∂-CM(2)

Here is our ﬁrst result in this section. For the rest of this section we assume that

k is a ﬁeld.

Proposition 3.3. Retain Hypothesis 3.2(1-5).
CM(s), ∂-CMl(s), ∂-CMr(s)), then so is B := R#H.

If R is ∂-CM (respectively, ∂-

Proof. Since B is isomorphic to R⊕ dim H as a right R-module, we have

∂(BB) = ∂(BR) = ∂(RR) =: d.

Let M be a f.g. graded right B-module with ∂-dimension i. Since ∂ is B/R-
hereditary, M , viewed as a right R-module, has ∂-dimension i, or ∂(MB) = ∂(MR).
It remains to show that j(MB) = j(MR).

16

The cohomology Extj

B(M, B) can be computed by Extj

R(M, B). Since H is

semisimple, by [Ne, Corollary 7.6], we have

(E3.3.1)

Extj

B(M, B) ∼= Extj

R(M, B)H .

Equation (E3.3.1) follows also from a more general result [St, Theorem 3.3] together
with [We, Lemma 9.1.9].

We recall the right H-module structure on Extj

R(M, B) as follows. Let

· · · −→ P −n −→ · · · −→ P 0 −→ MB −→ 0

be a f.g. projective resolution of MB. Let N be a right B-module. For j ≥ 0,
HomR(P −j, N ) has a right H-module structure deﬁned by

(f · h)(p) = f (p(Sh(1)))h(2)

for all p ∈ P −j, f ∈ HomR(P −j, N ) and h ∈ H, where S is the antipode of H and
we use Sweedler’s notation ∆(h) = h(1) ⊗ h(2). The right H-action is compatible
with the diﬀerential of the complex HomR(P •, N ), from which we obtain the right
H-action on Extj

R(M, N ).

We may form another smash product H#R as follows [RRZ, Lemma 2.1]: as a

vector space H#R = H ⊗ R, the product is deﬁned by

(h#r)(g#r′) = hg(2)#(S−1g(1) · r)r′.

The algebras R#H and H#R are isomorphic through the isomorphism:

deﬁned by

ϕ : R#H −→ H#R,

r#h 7→ h(2)#S−1h(1) · r.

For all j ≥ 0, we have the following morphism

Ψ : HomR(P −j, R#H) −→ HomR(P −j, H#R),

deﬁned by

and

deﬁned by

Ψ(f ) = ϕ ◦ f,

Φ : HomR(P −j, R) ⊗ H −→ HomR(P −j, H#R),

Φ(f ⊗ h)(p) = h#f (p).

One may check that both Ψ and Φ are isomorphisms of vector spaces and are
compatible with the diﬀerentials. Through the isomorphism ϕ, we view H#R as
a right R#H-module. Note that R can be viewed as a right R#H-module via the
action

r · (r′#h) = S−1h(rr′)

for r, r′ ∈ R and h ∈ H. Hence both HomR(P −j, H#R) and HomR(P −j, R) are
right H-modules. Now HomR(P −j, R) ⊗ H is also a right H-module by the usual
H-action deﬁned by

(f ⊗ g) · h = f · h(1) ⊗ gh(2)

PERTINENCY AND QUOTIENT CATEGORIES

17

for f ∈ HomR(P −j, R) and g, h ∈ H. Since ϕ is an isomorphism of algebras,
Ψ is an isomorphism of right H-modules. We next check that Φ is a right H-
module morphism, and hence it is indeed an isomorphism of right H-modules. For
f ∈ HomR(P −j, R), h, g ∈ H and p ∈ P −j, we have

[Φ(f ⊗ h) · g](p) = [(f ⊗ h)(pSg(1))]g(2)

= [h#f (pSg(1))]g(2)
= hg(3)#S−1g(2)f (p(Sg(1))),

Φ((f ⊗ h)g)(p) = Φ(f · g(1) ⊗ hg(2))(p)

= hg(2) ⊗ (f · g(1))(p)
= hg(3) ⊗ f (pSg(1)) · g(2)
= hg(3) ⊗ S−1g(2)f (pSg(1)).

Hence Φ is a right H-module morphism. Therefore the composition Φ−1Ψ induces
an isomorphism of complexes of right H-modules

HomR(P •, R#H) −→ HomR(P •, R) ⊗ H.

Applying (−)H , we obtain an isomorphism of complexes

HomR(P •, R#H)H ∼= (HomR(P •, R) ⊗ H)H .

Since (−)H is an exact functor, taking cohomology H j(−) and taking the invariants
(−)H commutes. Therefore we have

Extj

R(M, R#H)H ∼= (Extj

R(M, R) ⊗ H)H .

Combining with the isomorphism (E3.3.1), we ﬁnally obtain

(E3.3.2)

Extj

B(M, B) ∼= (Extj

R(M, R) ⊗ H)H .

By (E3.3.2), it is clear that j(MB) ≥ j(MR). Assume that x1, . . . , xn is a k-
s=1 ys ⊗ xs. Hence
R(M, R) 6= 0,
R(M, R) such that αys 6= 0 for some s. Now

Pn

we see that y1, . . . , yn generates H [Sw, Proposition 2.6].
there is a nonzero element α ∈ Extj
s=1 αys ⊗ xs 6= 0, which is in (Extj

This means that j(MB) ≤ j(MR). Therefore j(MB) = j(MR).

If Extj

Combine Lemmas 2.2, 1.6 and 3.1 and Proposition 3.3, we have the following

consequences.

k is a ﬁeld and that R is CM(α) for a positive integer α. Then Exti
RH (N, R) = 0
for all N ∈ grd−α RH and all i ≤ α − 1.

Proof. Let (A, B) = (RH , R#H). Then Hypothesis 2.1(1,2,3) can be veriﬁed easily.
By Proposition 3.3, B is CM(α). The assertion follows from Lemmas 1.6 and
2.2.
(cid:3)

Assisted by Proposition 3.3, Theorem 2.6 now reads in the following form. Recall

that the pertinency of H-action on R [Deﬁnition 0.1] is deﬁned to be

p(R, H) = GKdim R − GKdim(R#H)/(e)

where e = 1#R .

(i) The functor − ⊗B R : qgrd−2 B −→ qgrd−2 A is an equivalence.
(ii) The natural map ϕ : B −→ EndA(R) is an isomorphism of algebras.
(iii) p(R, H) ≥ 2.
(iv) H-action is homologically small in the sense of Deﬁnition 0.2(2).

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.6 after matching up with
notations and verifying the hypotheses by Proposition 3.3. Note that (iii) and (iv)
are equivalent by CM(2).
(cid:3)

Remark 3.6. (1) Theorem 0.3 is a special case of Theorem 3.5.

(2) A version of Theorem 3.5 holds when R is ungraded (or R is not locally

ﬁnite) as long as

(i) the GK-dimension on right RH-modules are exact,
(ii) the GK-dimension is R#H/RH-hereditary,
(iii) γn,1(eB) holds for GKdim.

(3) If R = C[x1, . . . , xd] is the polynomial algebra, and G a ﬁnite small subgroup
of GLd(C), the Auslander theorem says the natural map R#kG −→ EndRG (R) as
in Theorem 3.5 is an isomorphism of graded algebras [Au1, Yo, IT]. By Theorem
3.5, p(R, G) ≥ 2. See comments in [BHZ, Section 7].

(4) If R/RH is an H ∗-dense Galois extension in the sense of [HVZ2], then The-

orem 3.5 partially recovers [HVZ2, Theorem 3.8].

(5) Theorem 3.5 also partially recovers [MU, Theorem 3.7].

Next we prove Theorem 0.6.

Theorem 3.7. Retain Hypothesis 3.2(1,2,3). Let α be an integer no more than
p(R, H). Then there is an equivalence of categories

qgrd−α RH ∼= qgrd−α R#H.

Proof. By Lemma 1.6, hypothesis (E2.3.1) holds for ∂ = GKdim on graded mod-
ules. Hypothesis 2.1(1-3)(5-7) can be checked one by one. Therefore the assertion
follows by Lemma 2.3.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.8. Retain Hypothesis 3.2(1,2,3). Let R be an AS regular algebra. If
p(R, H) = GKdim R, then RH has graded isolated singularities.
Proof. By Theorem 3.7, qgrd−α RH ∼= qgrd−α R#H where the latter has ﬁnite
global dimension. The assertion follows by the deﬁnition, see [Ue, Deﬁnition 2.2].
(cid:3)

For the rest of this section we make some observations the condition to ensure

that p(R, H) ≥ 1. We recall a deﬁnition below.

Deﬁnition 3.9. A left H-module M is called inner faithful if IM 6= 0 for every
nonzero Hopf ideal I of H. We say that an H-action on A is inner faithful, if A is
an inner faithful left H-module.

Lemma 3.10. Retain Hypothesis 3.2(1-5) with ∂ = GKdim. Assume that k is a
ﬁeld. Suppose that R is a domain.

(1) [SkV, Theorem 0.5(i)] B := R#H is semiprime.

PERTINENCY AND QUOTIENT CATEGORIES

19

(2) [BCF, Corollary 3.4] B is prime if and only if the canonical algebra homo-

morphism φ : B → EndRH (R) is injective.

(3) If the map φ in part (2) is injective, then the H-action on R is inner faithful.

As a consequence, if B is prime, then the H-action is inner faithful.

(4) B is prime if and only if p(R, H) ≥ 1.

Proof. (1) This is a special case of [SkV, Theorem 0.5(i)].

(2) Condition [BCF, Lemma 3.3(ii)] can be checked by using GK-dimension. The

assertion follows from [BCF, Corollary 3.4].

(3) If the H-action on R is not inner faithful, there is a Hopf ideal 0 6= R ⊆ H
such that JR = 0. Thus φ(1#j) = 0 for all j ∈ J. The assertion follows. The
consequence follows from part (2).

(4) First we suppose that p(R, H) ≥ 1. By part (1), B is semiprime. Since B is
a free module over R, it is d-pure with respect to the GK-dimension in the sense
of [ASZ2, Deﬁnition 0.3]. Hypothesis (E2.3.1) can be checked for α = 1 when A is
a domain. By Lemma 2.3, qmodd−1 B ∼= qmodd−1 A. Since A is an Ore domain,
qmodd−1 A is equivalent to a module category over the quotient division ring Q(A)
of A. Therefore, qmodd−1 B is equivalent to a module category over a division ring.
Since B is GKdim-pure, qmodd−1 B ∼= mod Q(B) where Q(B) is the semisimple
artinian quotient ring of B. This implies that Q(B) is simple and B is prime.

The converse follows from the fact I = (e) ⊆ B is a nonzero ideal and B is
(cid:3)

prime.

Lemma 3.10 were suggested by Ellen Kirkman. The authors thank her for sharing

her ideas.

4. BGG correspondence

From now on let k be a ﬁeld. In this section, we study the quotient category
qgrd−α RH as appeared in the last section. If R is noetherian, connected graded,
AS regular and if the homological determinant of the H-action on R is trivial, then
RH is AS Gorenstein [KKZ1, Theorem 0.1].
In this case, the quotient category
qgrd−2 R#H, and hence, under the setting of Theorem 3.5 (assuming p(R, H) ≥
2), the quotient category qgrd−2 RH , is of ﬁnite global dimension, while the ﬁxed
subring RH has inﬁnite global dimension [CKWZ1, Theorem 0.6]. Hence it is
relatively easier to understand the category qgrd−2 R#H than to do the category
qgrd−2 RH directly.

We are now working over Koszul AS regular algebras. Let B = Ln≥0 Bn be

a noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebra such that B0 is a semisimple algebra.
Recall that a right graded B-module is called a Koszul module [Pr, BGS] if M has
a linear graded projective resolution:

· · · −→ P −n −→ · · · −→ P −1 −→ P 0 −→ M −→ 0,

where P −n are graded projective modules generated in degree n for all n ≥ 0. If
the right graded B-module B0 := B/B≥1 is a Koszul module, then B is called a
Koszul algebra.

Let B be a graded algebra and let

(E4.0.1)

E = E(B) := ⊕n≥0 Extn

B(B0, B0)

be the Yoneda algebra of B. By [BGS, Proposition 2.9.1 and Theorem 2.10.1], if
B is a Koszul algebra, then the Yoneda algebra E is also Koszul.

Lemma 4.1. Retain the notations as above and assume that B0 is semisimple.

(1) B′ is graded Morita equivalent to B. Namely, there is an equivalence of

graded module categories

Gr B′ ∼= Gr B,

which induces an equivalence of triangulated categories

D(Gr B′) ∼= D(Gr B).
(2) E(B) is graded Morita equivalent to E(B′).
(3) B is noetherian (respectively, AS Gorenstein, AS regular, Koszul) if and

only if so is B′.

(4) If k is algebraically closed, then B′

0 is a ﬁnite direct sum of k.

For the rest of this section, we assume that k is algebraic closed. Then B′

0 is a
ﬁnite direct sum of k [Lemma 4.1(4)]. In this case B′ is called the basic algebra of
B. If R is as in Theorem 3.5 and assume that R is a connected graded Koszul AS
regular algebra, then R#H is also a Koszul AS-regular algebra [HVZ1, Corollary
2.9]. Since the graded Morita equivalence of algebras preserves almost all algebraic
invariants [Lemma 4.1], we will study the basic algebra of R#H instead. In general,
one can replace B by its basic algebra B′ if necessary.

From now on, B = B0 ⊕ B1 ⊕ · · ·

is a noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebra

such that B0 is a ﬁnite direct sum of k. The following lemma is needed.

Lemma 4.2. [Ma, Theorem 5.1] Let B be a Koszul algebra. Then B is AS regular

B(B0, B0) is a graded Frobenius algebra.

Let B be a Koszul algebra. We may construct a diﬀerential bigraded algebra
j = 0 for all i 6= 0 with zero diﬀerential. We may

if and only if E :=Ln≥0 Extn
j = Bj and eBi

derived category of right graded B-modules (respectively, E-modules). Then the
general Koszul duality of bigraded diﬀerential graded algebras induces following
duality between the derived category of B and of E [HW, Remark 4.1], which is
a slightly diﬀerent from the equivalence obtained in [BGS]. Note that Smith-Van
den Bergh stated a similar result in [SmV].

Proposition 4.3. [SmV, Section 2.4] Let B be a Koszul AS regular algebra. We
have a duality of triangulated categories:

K : Db(gr B) −→ Db(gr E),

PERTINENCY AND QUOTIENT CATEGORIES

21

where K(M ) = G(RHomB(M, B0)) for M ∈ Db(gr B), and G is the regrading
functor deﬁned by G(X)n

for any complex of graded modules X ·.

s = X n+s
−s

Note that the functor K commutes with the shift functors in the following way

K(X ·[1]) = K(X ·)[−1] and K(X ·(1)) = K(X ·)[−1](1),

where as usual [1] is the shift of the complexes and (1) is the shift of the gradings.
For M ∈ gr E, let Ω(M ) be the ﬁrst syzygy of the minimal graded projective
resolution of M . Since E is a graded Frobenius algebra, Ω is an auto-equivalence
of the stable category grE. Moreover, grE is a triangulated category with the shift
functor Ω−1. We next show that the triangulated category grE admits some thick
triangulated subcategories. Some terminologies are needed next. Let M be a ﬁnite
dimensional right graded E-module. Take a minimal graded projective resolution
of M as follows

· · · −→ P −n −→ · · · −→ P 0 −→ M −→ 0.

Recall that the complexity of M , denoted by c(M ), is the least integer λ ≥ 0 such
that dim P −n < a nλ−1 for almost all n, where a > 0 is a ﬁxed number. The
deﬁnition of the complexity can be modiﬁed even for noninteger λ. Note that
c(M ) = 0 if and only if M is a ﬁnite dimensional graded projective E-module
(when E is Frobenius). The complexity of a module over a ﬁnite dimension algebra
is an important invariant in studying the representations of the algebra [Ca, CDW,
GLW].

Given a number λ ≥ 0, let Cλ be the full subcategory of grE consisting of objects
M with c(M ) ≤ λ. Similar to [CDW, Proposition 1.3], we have the following lemma,
whose proof is almost the same as that of [CDW, Proposition 1.3].

Lemma 4.4. The induced category Cλ is a thick triangulated subcategory of grE.

Proof. Let 0 → K → M → N → 0 be an exact sequence in gr E. Then one sees
c(M ) ≤ max{c(K), c(N )}. Hence M ∈ Cλ if K and N are in Cλ. Moreover, it
follows from [AR, Lemma 2.5] or [GLW, Lemma 2.7] that if K and M (resp. M
and N ) are in Cλ, then so is N (resp. K). If U → V → Q → Ω−1(U ) is a triangle
in grE with U, V ∈ Cλ, then both Q and Ω−1U are in Cλ, where Ω−1(U ) is the
ﬁrst syzygy of U by taking minimal graded injective resolution of U . Hence Cλ is a
triangulated subcategory of grE. Now if N is a direct summand of M in grE, then
N is a direct summand of M ⊕ P in gr E for some ﬁnite dimensional projective
module P . Thus, we have c(N ) ≤ c(M ). Therefore Cλ is thick.
(cid:3)

Let Db(projE) be the full subcategory of Db(gr E) consisting of all bounded
complexes of f.g. graded projective E-modules. Then Db(projE) is equivalent to
the triangulated subcategory of Db(gr E) generated by E. Since E is a graded
Frobenius algebra, there is a well known equivalence of triangulated categories [Be,
Corollary 3.9(c)]

Φ : Db(gr E)/Db(projE) −→ grE,

where the functor Φ is deﬁned in the following way. Let X · be an object in Db(gr E).
We write X · for its image in Db(gr E)/Db(projE). Take a bounded above f.g.
projective resolution P · of X ·. Since X · is bounded, we see that there is an integer
n such that the cohomology H iP · = 0 for all i ≤ −n. Now, let M be the nth
syzygy of the complex P . Deﬁne Φ(X ·) = Ωn−1(M ) [Or, Sect. 1.3].

22

One can easily extend the notion of the complexity to bounded complexes of
modules over a ﬁnite dimensional algebra. Let Λ := Λ0 ⊕ Λ1 ⊕ · · · be a ﬁnite
dimensional graded algebra such that Λ0 is a semisimple algebra. Let K −(gr Λ)
be the homotopy category of bounded above complexes of f.g.
right graded Λ-
modules. A bounded above complex of graded projective modules P · ∈ K −(gr Λ)
is called minimal if imdn is superﬂuous, namely, imdn ⊆ P nΛ≥1 for all n, where
Λ≥1 = Λ1 ⊕ Λ2 ⊕ · · · . Note that, for any bounded complex X · of f.g. right graded
Λ-modules, there is a minimal complex of graded projective modules P · that is
quasi-isomorphic to X ·. Such P · is called a minimal projective resolution of X ·. It
is known that minimal projective resolution of a bounded complex of f.g. graded
Λ-module is unique up to isomorphism. We deﬁne the complexity c(X ·) of X · to
be the least integer λ such that dim P −n ≤ a nλ−1 for almost all n ≥ 0. If two
bounded complexes X · and Y · are quasi-isomorphic, then their minimal projective
resolutions are isomorphic. Hence c(X ·) = c(Y ·). Hence, it makes sense to deﬁne
the complexity of an object in Db(gr A). For λ ≥ 0, we denote by Db
λ(gr Λ) the full
subcategory of Db(gr Λ) consisting of objects X · such that c(X ·) ≤ λ. One sees
that Db

0(gr Λ) is equivalent to Db(projΛ).

Lemma 4.5. Retain the above notation. Then Db
subcategory of Db(gr Λ) for all λ ≥ 0.

λ(gr Λ) is a thick triangulated

Proof. Take X ·, Y · ∈ Db
λ(gr Λ). Let f : X · → Y · be a morphism in Db(gr Λ),
and X · → Y · → Z · → X ·[1] be a triangle. Let P · and Q· be minimal projective
resolutions of X · and Y · respectively. The morphism f induces a morphism g :
P · → Q·. Then cone(g) ∼= Z in Db(gr Λ). Hence the minimal projective resolution
of Z · is a direct summand of cone(g). Therefore, c(Z ·) ≤ c(cone(g)) ≤ λ, and
hence Db
λ(gr Λ)
is closed under taking direct summands.
(cid:3)

λ(gr Λ) is a triangulated subcategory of Db(gr Λ). It is clear that Db

We can also extend the notion of the GK-dimension from modules to bounded
complexes. Let S be a noetherian locally ﬁnite graded algebra. Let X · be a

bounded complex of right graded S-modules. Set H ·(X ·) = Ln∈Z H n(X ·), the

total cohomology of X ·. Deﬁne the GK-dimension of X · as

GKdim X · := GKdim H ·(X ·).

By deﬁnition, if two complexes X · and Y · are quasi-isomorphic, then GKdim X · =
GKdim Y ·. Hence it makes sense to say the GK-dimension of an object in the
bounded derived category. For λ ≥ 0, let Db
(gr S) be the full subcategory of
Db(gr S) consisting of objects X · such that GKdim X · ≤ λ. One sees that X · ∈
(gr S) if and only if GKdim H n(X ·) ≤ λ for all n ∈ Z. Hence we have the

We now go back to the H-action on a noetherian connected graded AS regular

graded basic algebra of R#H. Recall that k is assumed to be algebraically closed.

Lemma 4.8. Let M be a right Koszul B-module. Then GKdim(M ) = c(K(M )).

Proof. Since B is a Koszul algebra, K(M ) is a Koszul E-module, moreover, K(M )
has a minimal projective resolution [GM, Proposition 5.1]

· · · −→ P −n −→ · · · −→ P −1 −→ P 0 −→ M −→ 0

such that P −n ∼= M ∗

n = Hom(Mn, k).

Assume c(K(M )) = λ. Then dim Mn ≤ dim P −n ≤ anλ−1 for some ﬁxed

number a > 0 and for all n ≫ 0. Hence GKdim(M ) ≤ λ.

Q, where Q :=Lw

Conversely, assume GKdim(M ) = λ. By assumption B is the basic algebra
of R#H. Hence there is a ﬁnitely generated graded progenerator R#H-module
i=1 Qi as given in (E4.0.2), such that EndR#H(Q) ∼= B. Write
F = −⊗R#H Q−1. Assume N is a graded right R#H-module such that F (N ) ∼= M .
Then GKdim(N ) = GKdim(M ) = λ by Remark 1.5(3). Note that N is also a
graded right R-module and by assumption R is a noetherian connected graded
AS regular algebra. By [ATV, Proposition 2.21] and [StZ, Corollary 2.2], we have
dim Nn ≤ anλ−1 for some ﬁxed number a > 0 and for all n ≫ 0. Since M = F (N ),
there is an a1 > 0 such that dim Mn ≤ a1 dim Nn ≤ a1anλ−1 for all n ≫ 0. Assume
dim E = b. Then dim P −n ≤ b dim Mn ≤ ba1anλ−1. Hence c(K(M )) ≤ λ.

Proof. Firstly, notice that if M is a f.g. Koszul graded B-module, then, by Propo-
sition 4.3, H i(K(M )) = 0 for i 6= 0. In particular, K(B0) ∼= E. Hence we see that
the thick triangulated subcategory of Db(gr B) generated by B0 is anti-equivalent
to the thick triangulated subcategory of Db(gr E) generated by E. The former is
(gr B) and the latter is equivalent to Db(projE) which is in turn
equivalent to Db

Since B is a Koszul AS-regular algebra, it follows that for suﬃciently large k the
graded B-module M≥k(k), where M≥k = Mk ⊕ Mk+1 ⊕ · · · , has linear resolution
(see [Jo1, Theorem 3.1], note that it is assumed that the algebra is connected graded
in [Jo1], however, the same proof holds in our case), that is, M≥k(k) is a Koszul
module. Consider the exact sequence

0 → M≥k → M → M/M≥k → 0.

24

Y.-H. BAO, J.-W. HE AND J. J. ZHANG

We see that GKdim M≥k = GKdim M ≤ λ and

K(M/M≥k) → K(M ) → K(M≥k) → K(M/M≥k)[1]

is a triangle in Db(gr E). Since M/M≥k is ﬁnite dimensional, K(M/M≥k) ∈
Db
0(gr E). Since M≥k(k) is a Koszul module, c(K(M≥k)) = GKdim(M≥k) ≤ λ
by Lemma 4.8. Hence K(M≥k) ∈ Db

veriﬁes claim (c).
For Y · ∈ Db

λ(gr E), let P · be a minimal projective resolution of Y ·. Then
dim P −n ≤ a nλ−1 for n ≫ 0. Since B0 is a direct sum of ﬁnitely many copies
of k, so is E0. Assume that E0 = k ⊕ · · · ⊕ k is the sum of s copies of k, and
that e1, . . . , es are the corresponding primitive idempotents. Then E = ⊕s

Assume r = min{dim Eei|i = 1, . . . , s}. By the minimality of P ·, we see that

then c(Φ(X ·)) ≤ λ. Hence Φ sends objects in Db
λ(gr E)/Db(projE) to objects in
Cλ. If N is a right graded E-module such that c(N ) ≤ λ, then we may view N
λ(gr E)/Db(projE), and we have Φ(N ) ∼= N ∈ Cλ. Therefore

Remark 4.12. In the case when λ = 0, we have C0 = 0 and qgr0 B = qgr B, the

B(B0, B0) are also

preserves the GK-dimension, we have that grλ(R#H) and grλ B are equivalent. As
a consequence, Db(qgrλ B) is equivalent to Db(qgrλ R#H). Combining this with
Theorems 3.5 and 4.11, we have

Db(qgrd−2 RH) ∼= Db(qgrd−2 R#H) ∼= Db(qgrd−2 B) ∼= grE′/Cd−2 ∼= grE/Cd−2.

actions on the (−1)-skew polynomial algebra k−1[x1, . . . , xn] and prove Theorems
0.5. We need a few lemmas.

Let R be a graded domain and let H be a dual group (kG)◦ acting on R homo-
geneously. Assume that the H-action on R is inner faithful. If R is generated in
degree 1, then this is equivalent to that H-action on R1 is inner faithful. In this
setting, R is also Z × G-graded. Forgetting the Z-grading, R is G-graded and R is
not G′-graded for any proper subgroups G′ ( G. Write R = ⊕g∈GRg. Part (5) of
the next lemma is due to [CKWZ2]. Let I be the ideal (e) in B := R#H where

e = 1#R andR is the integral of H such that ǫ(R ) = 1.

Lemma 5.1. Let R be a connected graded domain. Let H := (kG)◦ act on R inner
faithfully and write R = ⊕g∈GRg.
(1) For every g ∈ G, Rg 6= 0.
(2) R is a free H-module.

(3) If f ∈Tg∈G RRg, then f #1 ∈ I.

that the set {hw}m
f1 · · · fm#1 ∈ I.

(4) [CKWZ2] Suppose f1, · · · , fm ∈ R are G-homogeneous elements in R such
w=1 = G where hw := degG(fw) · · · degG(fm). Then

(5) Suppose d := GKdim R < ∞. Then R#H is prime and the algebra map

R#H → EndRH (R)
is injective. As a consequence, p(R, H) ≥ 1.

(6) p(R, H) ≥ d − GKdim R/(Tg∈G RRg) ≥ d − max{GKdim R/RRg | g ∈ G}.

(7) If there is an integer s such that RRg ⊇ R≥s for all g ∈ G, then p(R, H) =

d.

Proof. (1) Let X = {g ∈ G | Rg 6= 0}. Since R is a domain, X is a sub-semigroup
of G. Since X is ﬁnite, it is a group. By the inner faithfulness, X = G.

(2) We may assume R 6= k. Since R is a connected graded domain, R is inﬁnite
dimensional. As a consequence, RH is inﬁnite dimensional. So each Rg is inﬁnite
dimensional. So R is a free H-module of inﬁnite rank.

(3) Let {g1, · · · , gm} be the set G where g1 is the unit of G. The dual basis
{pg1, · · · , pgm } is the complete set of orthogonal idempotents of H that forms a
i=1 pgi is the algebra unit of H.

k-linear basis of H. The integral of H is pg1 andPm

The coproduct of H is determined by

∆(pg) = Xh∈H

ph ⊗ ph−1g

for all g ∈ G. Let f be a G-homogeneous element of degree g ∈ G. Then

ph(f )#ph−1 = pg(f )#pg−1 = f #pg−1.

e(f #1) = (1#pg1 )(f #1) =Xh

This implies that

for all f ∈ Rg. Since I is a left R-module, we have

f #pg−1 ∈ I

If f ∈Tg∈G RRg, then f #pg−1 ∈ I for all g ∈ G. Then f #1 =Pg∈G f #pg−1 ∈ I.

RRg#pg−1 ⊆ I.

(4) Let hw = degG(fw) · · · degG(fm) and let f = f1 · · · fm. Then fw · · · fm ∈ Rhw

and f ∈ RRhw for all w. By hypothesis {hw}m
The assertion follows by part (3).

w=1 equals G. Then f ∈Tg∈G RRg.

(5) By part (3,4), there is a nonzero element f ∈ R such that f #1 ∈ I. Then
B/(I) has GK-dimension no more than the GKdim R−1, or equivalently, p(R, H) ≥
1. The assertion follows by Lemma 3.10(2,4).

(6) This follows from Lemma 5.2 below and the fact that the image of R →

R#H/(I), denoted by R′, is a quotient of R/(Tg∈G RRg), by part (3), and that
there is an embedding R/(Tg∈G RRg) →Lg∈G R/(RRg).

(7) This is an immediate consequence of (6).

(cid:3)

Let T be a subalgebra of R such that RT and T R are f.g..

Lemma 5.2. Let R′ be the image of the map R → B → B/I and T ′ be the image
of T in R′. Then GKdim T ′ = GKdim R′ = GKdim B/I.

Proof. This follows from the fact that B/I is f.g. over R′.

(cid:3)

Aiming for a proof of Theorem 0.5, we now let R be the (−1)-skew polynomial
ring k−1[x1, · · · , xn]. Let H be the group algebra kW where W is generated by the
permutation σ : xi → xi+1, xn → x1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Theorem 0.5 asserts that
R#kW ∼= EndRW (R).

p(R, H) is preserved by ﬁeld extensions. Let yj =Pn

Let ξ be a ﬁxed primitive nth root of unity. We might assume that ξ ∈ k since
i=1 ξijxi. Then {y1, · · · , yn}
is a basis of R1. It is clear that σ(yj ) = ξ−jyj. Let T be the central subalgebra of
R generated by {x2

i=1 is a basis of the

vector space ⊕n

The group algebra kW can be viewed as a (kG)◦ where G is the character group
of W . Note that G ∼= W as abstract groups. Let g be a generator of G such that
degG(y1) = g. Then degG(yi) = gi for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.

Let Un = {(0, 1), (1, 2), · · · , (⌊ n

2 ⌋)}. For any integer i, let i be the integer
between 0 and n − 1 such that i = i mod n. The following lemma is easy to check.

Lemma 5.3. Retain the above notation for R. Let i, j, k be integers (between 0
and n − 1 modulo n).

(1) yiyj + yjyi = 2Yi+j = 2Yi+j.
(2) ykyjyi = −ykyiyj + (yiyj + yjyi)yk.

Proof. (1) By a direct computation.

(2) This follows from part (1) and the fact Yi+j is central in R.
(3) This follows from Lemma 5.2 and the fact T /(Yi | i = 0, · · · , n − 1) = k.
(4) Follows from part (1).
From now on we assume that n is even.
(5) It follows from part (1).
(6) Since degG(ysys−1) is odd, which is coprime to n. The assertion follows from

Lemma 5.1(4).

(7) We use Diamond lemma. Fix an order y0 < y1 < · · · < yn−2 < yn−1 in R′′,

and extend it to the lexicographical order on all monomials.

By part (5), for any j > i, yjyi can be written as a linear combination of lower

(2), if k > j > i, ykyjyi can be written as a linear combination of lower terms.

Let X be a reduced monomial basis of R′′. Let 0 6= f = yi1yi2 · · · yih ∈ X.
Then iα 6= iα+1 since y2
i = 0 in R′′ for all i. Since there are only n possible iα,
the maximal length of increasing iα is at most n. If iα > iα+1, then, by part (5),
iα ≤ n
2 and iα+1 = iα − 1. Suppose we have two pairs (iα, iα+1) and (iβ, iβ+1)
in Un with α < β. By part (2), β 6= α + 1.
If β > α + 1, then is are strictly
increasing between iα+1 and iβ. So iβ ≥ iα + 1. If β = α + 1, then iβ ≥ iα. By
part (6), (yiαyiα−1)n = 0 in R′′. This implies that there are at most 1
2 n2 pairs
(iα, iα+1) ∈ Un appeared in f . Hence the degree of f is uniformly bounded. This
means that X is ﬁnite and R′′ has ﬁnite dimension.

(8) By part (4), we may assume s < n

2 . If s is odd (which is coprime to n), then,

by Lemma 5.1(4), yn

s = 0 in R′.

Now we consider general s. By Lemma 5.1(3), it suﬃces to show that y2(d+1)

s = yiy2s−i + y2s−iyi ≡ yiy2s−i.

We prove by induction that, for each w,

iα = 2αs − 2α−1i,

and jα = −2αs + 2α−1i + 2s.

When w = 1, this is (E5.3.1). Suppose (E5.3.2) holds for w − 1 ≥ 1. Then

(2ys)2w = (2y2

since yjw yiw−1 · · · yi2 yi1 ∈ Rgi . Therefore (E5.3.1) follows from the induction. Now
take w = d, we have

degG(yid · · · yi1 ) = g(2d+1−2)s−(2d−1)i = g−2s+i

which implies that degG(y2

Proposition 5.4. Let R be the (−1)-skew polynomial ring k−1[x1, · · · , xn] for n ≥
2. Let H be the group algebra kW where W is generated by the permutation σ :
xi → xi+1, xn → x1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Suppose n = 2d for some d ≥ 1.

(1) p(R, H) = GKdim R = n ≥ 2.
(2) qgr0 R#H ∼= qgr0 RH .
(3) RH has graded isolated singularities in the sense of [Ue, Deﬁnition 2.2].

Proof. (1) By Lemma 5.2, it suﬃces to show that GKdim R′ = 0. Let p be a
s is normal in R′. By
minimal prime ideal of R′ and let T = R′/p. For any s, y2
Lemma 5.3(8), (y2
s = 0 in T . By
Lemma 5.3(7), T is ﬁnite dimensional (and hence T ∼= k). Therefore R′ is ﬁnite
dimensional and GKdim R′ = 0 as desired.

s )(d+1) = 0 in R′. Since T = R′/p is prime, y2

(2) This is a consequence of Theorem 0.6.
(3) This follows from the deﬁnition and part (2).

(cid:3)

Remark 5.5. We have some comments concerning the above computation.

(1) It is a little bit surprising that if n = 2d, then p(R, H) = GKdim R. However

conjecture 0.9 would give an explanation of this phenomena.

(2) We conjecture that when n 6= 2d, then p(R, H) < GKdim R and RH does
not have graded isolated singularities. It would be nice if there is a formula
for dimsing(RH ) in terms of n.

In practice, we assume that H acts on A inner faithfully. When R is an AS
regular domain, we conjecture that p(R, H) ≥ 1, see Lemma 3.10. By Theorem
3.5, when p(R, H) ≥ 2, then the Auslander theorem holds. By Lemma 2.3, when
p(R, H) = α (or more generally p(R, H) ≥ α), then qgrd−α R#H ∼= qgrd−α RH
where d = GKdim R. Since R#H is regular, this equivalence gives some bounds
on the dimension of singular locus of RH . Therefore p(R, H) relates several other
properties and invariants of the H-action on R.

The deﬁnition of reﬂection number r(R, G) is given in Deﬁnition 0.8. Recall that
G is called conventionally small if r(R, G) ≥ 2. If the Conjecture 0.9 holds, then
Auslander theorem holds for classical small groups by Theorem 3.5.

Remark 5.6.

(1) By deﬁnition, r(R, G′) ≥ r(R, G) if G′ is a subgroup of G.

(2) Suggested by part (1), we conjecture that p(R, H ′) ≥ p(R, H) if H ′ is a

Hopf subalgebra of H (assuming H ′-action on R is still inner faithful).

(3) It is not clear to us if there is any relationship between dimsing(RH ′

dimsing(RH ). Suggested by part (2), we would guess that dimsing(RH ′
dimsing(RH ), but we don’t have any result to support the claim.

) and
) ≤

We can compute some bounds for p(R, G) and r(R, G) in the following situation.

Theorem 5.7. Let R be the (−1)-skew polynomial ring k−1[x1, · · · , xn] for n ≥ 2.
Let H be the group algebra kW where W is generated by the permutation σ : xi →
xi+1, xn → x1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.

.

As a consequence, Conjecture 0.9 holds in this case.

Proof. (1) This is Proposition 5.4.

(2) Let σ be the cycle permutation sending xi → xi+1 for all i < n and sending
xn to x1. Let g be σi for some i < n. Then g is a product of a-many of disjoint
cycles of length b where ab = n. Let o(g) be the order of the pole of T r(g, t)
at t = 1. By [KKZ2, Lemma 1.7], o(g) is equal to the number of odd cycles.
(The authors of [KKZ2] assume that char k = 0, however, [KKZ2, Lemma 1.7]
holds when char k 6= 2.) Hence o(g) = a = n/b when b is odd.
If n is of the
form 2d, then o(g) = 0 and r(R, G) = n.
If n contains some odd factor, then
the maximal possible o(g) attains when b is the smallest odd prime factor of n.
Therefore r(R, G) = n − n/p where p is the minimal odd prime factor of n. The
assertion follows.

(3) As before, let R′ be the image of R in B/I and let T be the subalgebra of
i=1. Then T is commutative and GKdim T = GKdim R′ =

R′ generated by {x2
GKdim B/I. It suﬃce to show that

GKdim T /p ≤ n −(φ(n) n = odd, or n = 2m with m > 1 an odd number

j=1 ξij xj
i = Y2i. Since x2

Let i0 be any positive integer less than n that is coprime to n. The cardinality
of {Y2i0 | gcd(i0, n) = 1}, denoted by Nn, is φ(n) when n is odd, or n = 2m with
m > 1 an odd number; and 1
2 φ(n) when n = 2km with k ≥ 2. We give some details
in the case when n = 2m where m > 1 is an odd integer. It suﬃces to show that
Y2i0 6= Y2i1 if gcd(i0, n) = gcd(i1, n) = 1 and 1 ≤ i0 < i1 ≤ n. If Y2i0 = Y2i1 , then
n | 2(i1 − i0). This implies that m | (i1 − i0). Since both i1 and i0 are odd (as
gcd(i0, n) = gcd(i1, n) = 1), 2m | (i1 − i0), which is impossible. So Nn = φ(n) in
this case.

Suppose gcd(n, i0) = 1. By Lemma 5.1, yn

i0 = 0 in R′ (by taking fi = yi0 for
all i). Then Y n
i0 = 0. Since T /p is prime, Y2i0 = 0 in T /p. Therefore T /p
is generated by no more than (n − Nn) elements. This implies that GKdim T /p ≤
n − Nn and the assertion follows.

2i0 = y2n

(4) This is an immediate consequence of parts (1,2).

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 0.5.

Proof of Theorem 0.5. Note that G = W . By Theorem 5.7(1,3), p(R, W ) ≥ 2. It
is well-known that skew polynomial rings are CM. Then the ﬁnal assertion follows
from Theorem 0.3.
(cid:3)

Let Sn act on {x1, · · · , xn} as permutations. This action extends to an algebraic
action on both commutative polynomial ring k[x1, · · · , xn] and the skew polynomial
ring k−1[x1, · · · , xn]. We deﬁne the pertinency for Sn and its subgroups in these
cases.

Deﬁnition 5.8. Suppose char k = 0. Let G be a subgroup of Sn that acts naturally
on k[x1, · · · , xn] and k−1[x1, · · · , xn] respectively. Deﬁne the positive and negative
pertinency of G to be

p+(G) = p(k[x1, · · · , xn], G) and p−(G) = p(k−1[x1, · · · , xn], G)

respectively.

Question 5.9. Is there a combinatorial algorithm to compute p+(G) and p−(G)
for all G ⊆ Sn?

The second part of the above question concerning p−(G) was suggested by Ellen

Kirkman. See [BHZ, Section 7] for more comments.
