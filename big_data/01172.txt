L-KURAMOTO-SIVASHINSKY SPDES VS. TIME-FRACTIONAL

SPIDES: EXACT CONTINUITY AND GRADIENT MODULI,

1/2-DERIVATIVE CRITICALITY, AND LAWS

HASSAN ALLOUBA AND YIMIN XIAO

Abstract. We establish exact, dimension-dependent, spatio-temporal, uni-
form and local moduli of continuity for (1) the fourth order L-Kuramoto-
Sivashinsky (L-KS) SPDEs and for (2) the time-fractional stochastic partial
integro-diﬀerential equations (SPIDEs), driven by space-time white noise in
one-to-three dimensional space. Both classes were introduced—with Brownian-
time-type kernel formulations—by Allouba in a series of articles starting in
2006, where he presented class (2) in its rigorous stochastic integral equations
form. He proved existence, uniqueness, and sharp spatio-temporal H¨older reg-
ularity for the above two classes of equations in d = 1, 2, 3. We show that both
classes are (1/2)− H¨older continuously diﬀerentiable in space when d = 1, and
we give the exact uniform and local moduli of continuity for the gradient in
both cases. This is unprecedented for SPDEs driven by space-time white noise.
Our results on exact moduli show that the half-derivative SPIDE is a critical
case. It signals the onset of rougher modulus regularity in space than both
time-fractional SPIDEs with time-derivatives of order < 1/2 and L-KS SPDEs.
This is despite the fact that they all have identical spatial H¨older regularity,
as shown earlier by Allouba. Moreover, we show that the temporal laws gov-
erning (1) and (2) are fundamentally diﬀerent. We relate L-KS SPDEs to the
Houdr´e-Villa bifractional Brownian motion, yielding a Chung-type law of the
iterated logarithm for these SPDEs. We use the underlying explicit kernels
and spectral/harmonic analysis to prove our results. On one hand, this work
builds on the recent works on delicate sample path properties of Gaussian ran-
dom ﬁelds. On the other hand, it builds on and complements Allouba’s earlier
works on (1) and (2). Similar regularity results hold for Allen-Cahn nonlinear
members of (1) and (2) on compacts via change of measure.

1. Introduction, statement of results, and preliminaries

1.1. Two sides of the Brownian-time coin. We delve into delicate regularity
properties of paths of fourth order pattern formation stochastic PDEs (SPDEs)
and time-fractional slow diﬀusion stochastic partial integro-diﬀerential equations
(SPIDEs). The fundamental kernels associated with the deterministic versions
of these two diﬀerent classes are both built on the Brownian-time processes in
[12, 7, 6]1 and extensions thereof. We thus think of these two classes of equations

1See also the multi-time-parameter interacting versions of these equations in [4, 11]

CONTINUITY MODULI OF TIME-FRACTIONAL SPIDES AND L-KS SPDES

as “two sides of the Brownian-time coin”. It is therefore often useful and eﬃcient
to study both simultaneously and compare and contrast their various properties.
In this article, we unveil a rather detailed set of results giving the exact dimension-
dependent uniform and local modulus of continuity, in time and space, for two
important classes of stochastic equations:

(1) the fourth order L-Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (L-KS) SPDEs connected to pat-
tern formation phenomena accompanying the appearance of turbulence (see
[1, 5, 6] for the L-KS class and for its connection to many classical and new
examples of pattern formation deterministic and stochastic PDEs, and see
[18, 42] for classical examples of stochastic and deterministic pattern for-
mation PDEs); and

(2) time-fractional SPIDEs connected to slow diﬀusion or diﬀusion in material
with memory (see [12, 7, 17, 19, 26, 27, 31, 32] for connected PDEs in the
deterministic setting and see [2, 3, 5] for the associated stochastic integral
equations (SIEs), followed later by the articles [14, 16, 35], in the stochastic
setting).

We also characterize the temporal laws for these two classes of equations. More
speciﬁcally, we prove our results on the exact uniform and local moduli of continuity
for the canonical equations2

2In addition to equations (1.1) and (1.2), the general L-KS SPDEs and time-fractional SPIDEs
classes include many nonlinear equations (both well known as well as new). We refer the reader
to Theorem 5.1 and Sections 1.2 and 1.5 below for more on that. The constants in (1.1) and (1.2)
can easily be changed by scaling. We will alternate freely between the notations ∂uf (u, v) and
∂f (u, v)/∂u.

measure, and we denote it by W .

Of course, equations (1.1) and (1.2) are formal (and nonrigorous) equations. Their
rigorous formulations, which we work with in this article, are given in mild form as
kernel stochastic integral equations (SIEs). These SIEs were ﬁrst introduced and
treated by Allouba [5, 3, 2, 1], with their genesis in [12, 7, 6]. We give them below
in Section 1.5, along with the relevant details.

The results here build on the following works: (1) Allouba [5, 3, 2, 1] who
established the existence/uniqueness as well as sharp dimension-dependent Lp and
H¨older regularity of the linear and nonlinear noise versions of (1.1) and (1.2) (he
presented and treated the later in its stochastic integral equation form); and (2)
Xiao [49, 50]; Meerschaert, Wang, and Xiao [34]; Wu and Xiao [45]; Xiao and
Xue [51]; who established several delicate analytic and geometric path properties of
Gaussian processes and random ﬁelds (see also the related works in [43, 44, 24, 25]).

1.2. Five questions. In a series of articles [5, 3, 2], Allouba introduced and inves-
tigated the regularity of the rigorous kernel stochastic integral form5 of the formal
time-fractional SPIDEs in (1.2) with diﬀusion coeﬃcient a:

He called these stochastic integral equations time-fractional and Brownian-time
Brownian motion (β = 1/2) SIEs. Starting with the 2006 article [5], he proved the
existence of a pathwise unique, continuous, and Lp bounded random ﬁeld solution
on {R+ × Rd}, d = 1, 2, 3, to the stochastic integral equation formulation of (1.2)
when β = 1/2 (the Brownian-time process or Brownian-time Brownian motion
(BTBM) SIE). He proved in [5] that, in the case a ≡ 1, the solution U satisﬁes the

He further proved in [3, 2] that, under a Lipschitz assumption on the nonlinear a,
there is a pathwise H¨older continuous solution Uβ to the SIE formulation of (1.6)
such that, for any arbitrary T > 0 and T = [0, T ],

continuity (no Lipschitz assumption) and linear growth conditions on the nonlinear
a, the existence of lattice limits solutions to the SIE corresponding to (1.6), with
the same H¨older regularity as in (1.8). In [5, 1], motivated by [6], he introduced and
gave the explicit kernel stochastic integral equation formulation for a large class of
stochastic equations he called L-KS SPDEs. This class includes stochasric versions
of prominent nonlinear equations like the Swift-Hohenberg PDE, variants of the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE, as well as many new ones (see [1]). He established
in [1], among other things, the existence of a pathwise unique solution U to the
nonlinear L-KS SPDE (1.1) with Lipschitz diﬀusion coeﬃcient a:

with the same H¨older regularity for U as the β = 1/2 case in (1.6) (BTBM SPIDE
or SIE6) obtained by plugging β = 1/2 in (1.8). In addition, the articles [3, 2, 1]
are the ﬁrst to obtain solutions to space-time white noise driven equations that
are smoother in time or space—twice as smooth in space in d = 1, 2, as is clear
from (1.8)—than the Brownian sheet W corresponding to the driving white noise.
Moreover, the kernels in these time-fractional SIEs, when β ∈ {1/2k; k ∈ N},
are fundamental solutions to higher order PDEs (where β−1 is the order of the
Laplacian as detailed in [2]). Thus, the regularity results in [2], given in (1.8),
mean that the maximum integer number of dimensions for the existence of random
ﬁeld solutions for space-time white noise driven equations is 3, no matter how
high the Laplacian order is. They also mean that the solutions for such equations
are spatially γs-H¨older for all γs ∈ (0, 1) (nearly locally Lipschitz) in dimensions
d = 1, 2 and γs ∈ (0, 1/2) (nearly locally H¨older 1/2) in d = 3. As observed in [2],
when β ∈ {1/2k; k ∈ N}, letting β ց 0 (the order of the Laplacian β−1 ր ∞) does
not increase the spatial H¨older regularity and the extra H¨older regularizing force is
manifested entirely temporally.

These results in [1]–[3] naturally lead to the following list of motivating questions:
(Q1) Consider the L-KS SPDE and time-fractional SPIDEs in spatial dimension

d = 1.
(a) Are the solutions to (1.9) and (1.6) actually spatially locally Lipschitz
(not just nearly locally Lipschitz as in d = 2)? This would be unprece-
dented in SPDEs driven by space-time white noise, and is suggested
by the sharp L2 upper bounds on the kernels spatial diﬀerences in
Lemma 2.4 in [3, 2] and Lemma 3.3 in [1] and is alluded to in Remark
1.2 in [3].

(b) Even more, are the solutions to (1.9) and (1.6) spatially continuously
diﬀerentiable? and is the one dimensional spatial exponent 3/2 in

6 We remind the reader that when β = 1/2 the scaled BTBM kernel, which is the fundamental
solution to the a ≡ 0 version of (1.6), is also the fundamental solution to the fourth order

ﬁrst obtained in [12, 7]. Of course, these sharp H¨older exponents for (1.9) and (1.6) play a crucial
role in our exact moduli of continuity for both the L-KS SPDE and the β time fractional SPIDEs,
as is clear from Theorem 1.1–Theorem 1.6 below.

the solutions H¨older exponent (3/2 ∧ 1)− in (1.8) indicating that the
gradient of these solutions is nearly locally H¨older 1/2 in space? Also,
what is the temporal H¨older regularity of the gradient?

(c) If the answer to the ﬁrst two parts of (b) is yes, what are the moduli
of continuity of the gradient of the solutions to (1.9) and (1.6), in the
space and time variables, respectively?

(Q2) In [2], it was established that, for each d ∈ {1, 2, 3}, the time-fractional
SIEs (time fractional SPIDEs in (1.6)) all have the same spatial H¨older
regularity—( 4−d
2 ∧ 1)−—for all β ∈ {1/2k; k ∈ N}, as is clear from (1.8).
Is the spatial modulus of continuity a more discriminating measure of reg-
ularity that depends on β ∈ {1/2k; k ∈ N}, and is β = 1/2 critical on
(0, 1/2]?
(Q3) It was established in [3, 2, 1] that the L-KS SPDE (1.9) and the β =
1/2 time-fractional SIEs (time fractional SPIDEs in (1.6)) have identical
spatio-temporal H¨older regularity. Does the continuity modulus capture
the rougher regularity for the case β = 1/2 time-fractional SPIDEs (1.6)
(since, by footnote 6, (1.6) is also associated with the rougher positive bi-
Laplacian PDE (1.10))?

(Q4) What are the exact spatio-temporal moduli of continuity for (1.1) and (1.2)

in d = 1, 2, 3.

(Q5) What are the temporal probability laws associated with L-KS SPDEs and

time-fractional SPIDEs?

1.3. Main results: answering the questions. We answer all of the above ques-
tions at length in the a ≡ 1 Gaussian case for our two classes of equations in our
main results7, which we now present. First, we deal with the L-KS SPDEs.

1.3.1. Exact moduli of continuity of L-KS SPDEs and their gradient, and the bifrac-
tional Brownian motion link. We start with the temporal regularity and probability
law for L-KS SPDE (1.1) in spatial dimensions d = 1, 2, 3. Recall that, given con-
stants H ∈ (0, 1) and K ∈ (0, 1], the bifractional Brownian motion (BH,K
)t∈[0,T ],
introduced by Houdr´e and Villa in [21], is a centered Gaussian process with covari-

Remark 1.1. Theorem 1.1 establishes the temporal modulus of continuity part
of Q4 and answers Q5 (when ϑ = 0) for L-KS SPDEs. We observe that since u0
is assumed suﬃciently smooth and deterministic, the deterministic part of (1.1)
is C1,4(R+, Rd) smooth (see [6, 1]) and the modulus is controlled by the random
parts of the SPDEs (1.1) (or their associated SIEs (1.47) below, with a ≡ 1). In
addition to giving the precise dimension-dependent temporal modulus of continuity,
Theorem 1.1 says that, up to a constant, the simple (ϑ = 0) L-KS SPDE solution
process {U (t, x), t ≥ 0} has the same law as a bifractional Brownian motion with
indices H = 1
4 . Thus, U shares all the temporal sample path
properties with a B(1/2,(4−d)/4), in spatial dimensions d = 1, 2, 3, which can be
found in [22, 39, 43].

We next state our spatial modulus result for the L-KS SPDE (1.1). Theorem 1.2,
along with Theorems 1.5 and 1.6 below, give the ﬁrst instance of space-time white
noise driven SPDEs that have a H¨older continuous gradient8.

Fix (ε, ϑ) ∈ R+ × R and ﬁx t ∈ R+. Assume that (U, W ) is the unique solution

Remark 1.2. Theorem 1.2 answers the spatial modulus of continuity part of Q4
and answers Q1 for L-KS SPDEs. When d = 1, Theorem 1.2 signiﬁcantly reﬁnes
the H¨older conclusion of Theorem 1.1 in [1] from U being nearly locally Lipschitz in
space to continuously diﬀerentiable (and hence locally Lipschitz) in space. More-
over, it also says that, for d = 1 and for any ﬁxed time t, the spatial derivative of
the solution to the L-KS SPDE (1.1), ∂xU (t, x), is nearly locally H¨older 1/2 (has
H¨older exponent γ ∈ (0, 1/2)) in space. In addition, spatially, Theorem 1.2 gives
the exact uniform and local moduli of continuity for the gradient ∂xU in d = 1; the
exact uniform and local moduli of continuity of U in d = 3; and sharp upper bounds
on these moduli of continuity of U in d = 2. We note that moduli of continuity of
U in the d = 2 case are diﬀerent from those for d = 3 and the sample functions are

nearly locally Lipschitz. However, we believe that, unlike in the case of d = 1, the
sample function x 7→ U (t, x) is nowhere diﬀerentiable in the case of d = 2.
For the case of d = 2, proving the nondiﬀerentiability and the exact spatial
moduli of continuity will need substantial extra work because, as a main technical
tool for studying these problems, the property of strong local nondeterminism has
only been proved in [49, 50, 51] for Gaussian random ﬁelds with (directional) H¨older
exponents smaller than 1. See Remarks below for further information. We will
study these and some related problems in a subsequent paper.

The comparative question Q3 will be answered completely after stating the cor-

responding results for time-fractional SPIDEs (Theorems 1.5 and 1.6 below).

The last main result for L-KS SPDEs gives the sharp temporal H¨older and the
exact temporal continuity modulus regularity for the spatial gradient of the L-
KS SPDE. Let Hγ−
∗ (R+; R) be the space of locally H¨older continuous functions
f : R+ → R whose H¨older exponent γ ∈ (0, γ∗).

Theorem 1.3 (Sharp temporal H¨older and exact continuity moduli for the
L-KS SPDE gradient). Assume d = 1 and ﬁx (ε, ϑ) ∈ R+ × R and x ∈ R.
Assume that (U, W ) is the unique solution to (1.1) on (Ω, F ,{Ft}, P), with u0
satisfying (1.5) (a). Then, ∂xU (·.x) ∈ H(1/8)− (R+; R), almost surely. More-
over, there exist constants ki ∈ (0,∞) (i = 6, 7) such that

Remark 1.3. Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 not only tell us that, when d = 1, the L-KS
SPDE (1.1) gradient ∂xU exists and is continuous, but they also give us thorough
spatio-temporal regularity results for ∂xU , in both the H¨older and modulus senses.
This contrasts starkly with the standard second order heat SPDE whose solution is
only spatially H¨older continuous with exponent γ ∈ (0, 1/2). The spatial gradient
spatio-temporal H¨older regularity in Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 tell us that the gradient
of L-KS SPDEs, ∂xU , is rougher (γ-H¨older with γ ∈ (0, 1/2)) in space than the
continuously diﬀerentiable (and hence Lipschitz) solution U . More surprisingly,
∂xU is also rougher in time than U (γ-H¨older with γ ∈ (0, 1/8) vs. γ ∈ (0, 3/8) as
in Allouba [1]). Compared to the second order heat SPDE, the L-KS gradient ∂xU
has the same spatial H¨older regularity as that of the solution to the heat SPDE;
and ∂xU is twice as rough (half as smooth) as the heat SPDE solution in time,
with H¨older exponent γ ∈ (0, 1/8) vs. the well-known γ ∈ (0, 1/4) for the heat
SPDE. Similar comments apply with respect to the moduli of continuity of ∂xU as
compared to those of U and to the heat SPDE (see Meerschaert, Wang, and Xiao
[34] for the heat SPDE moduli of continuity).

1.3.2. Exact moduli of continuity for the time-fractional SPIDEs and their gradient,
and their temporal fractional laws. We now turn to the regularity of the β-time-
fractional SPIDEs (1.2) (and their corresponding time-fractional SIEs) and to their
temporal fractional law. The uniform and local temporal continuity moduli for
Uβ, as well as the law governing the behavior of the solution process Uβ(·, x) =
{Uβ(t, x); t ≥ 0} of (1.2), are given by the next result.
To fully state the next theorem, we need to recall the deﬁnition of the generalized
hypergeometric (or simply the hypergeometric) function pFq(a1, . . . , ap; b1, . . . , bq; z):

(1.24) pFq(a1, . . . , ap; b1, . . . , bq; z) :=

We are now ready for our result.

Theorem 1.4 (Temporal moduli of continuity and laws of the β-time-fractional
SPIDEs in d = 1, 2, 3). Let β ∈ (0, 1/2] and let (Uβ, W ) be the unique solution
to (1.2) on (Ω, F ,{Ft}, P), with u0 satisfying (1.5) (b). Fix x ∈ Rd (d =

Remark 1.4. Theorem 1.4 answers the temporal modulus of continuity part of Q4

continuity moduli of L-KS SPDEs (1.1), Theorem 1.4 gives the ﬁrst contrasting be-
haviors of (1.1) and the half-derivative or Brownian-time Brownian motion SPIDE
((1.2) with β = 1/2).

The fundamental diﬀerence between the Gaussian laws of the time-fractional
SPIDEs and the L-KS SPDE, even at β = 1/2, is most easily seen in the fourth
order Brownian-time Brownian motion (β = 1/2) PDE, obtained ﬁrst in [12, 7] 9:

The memory term
shared with the deterministic version of (1.9) (a ≡ 0), and the opposite sign of
the bi-Laplacian in (1.28) vs. that in the L-KS PDE are manifestations of the
fundamental reason why the L-KS SPDE and BTBM SPIDE have diﬀerent laws.

We next state our spatial modulus result for the β-time-fractional SPIDEs (1.2).
We will distinguish the cases 0 < β < 1/2 and β = 1/2, where subtle diﬀerences
arise. It is interesting to notice that, for 0 < β < 1/2, the spatial moduli of SPIDEs
(1.2) are identical, modulo constants, to those of the L-KS SPDEs (1.1).

Theorem 1.5 (Spatial moduli of continuity for the β-time-fractional SPIDEs

to (1.2) on (Ω, F ,{Ft}, P), with u0 satisfying (1.5) (b). We assume t ∈ R+ is

When β = 1/2, the next result shows that the (BTBM) SPIDE is critical, sig-
naling the onset of rougher spatial sample paths, in d = 1, 2, 3, than both the
time-fractional SPIDEs with β < 1/2 and the L-KS SPDE10. This is despite the
fact that they all have the same spatial H¨older regularity as established ﬁrst in
Allouba [3, 2, 1].

The last main result for time-fractional SPIDEs gives the sharp temporal H¨older
and the exact temporal continuity modulus regularity for the spatial gradient of
these time-fractional SPIDEs.

time-fractional SPIDEs gradient). Assume d = 1, x ∈ R, and let β ∈ (0, 1/2].
Assume that (Uβ, W ) is the unique solution to (1.2) on (Ω, F ,{Ft}, P), with

Remark 1.5. For d = 1, Theorems 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 give us the existence, as well as
thorough results on the spatio-temporal moduli of continuity for the gradient ∂xUβ
of the β-time-fractional SPIDEs (1.2). Spatially, Theorems 1.5 and 1.6 say that,

14

HASSAN ALLOUBA AND YIMIN XIAO

even though the H¨older exponent of the gradient x 7→ ∂xUβ(t, x) is the same for
all β ∈ (0, 1/2], the exact uniform and local moduli of continuity for β ∈ (0, 1/2)
and β = 1/2. The SPIDEs gradient ∂xUβ is spatially rougher in the modulus
sense at β = 1/2 than it is for β < 1/2; and ∂xUβ has the same spatial modulus of
continuity as that of the L-KS SPDE gradient for β < 1/2. Theorem 1.7 shows that
the time-fractional SPIDE gradient ∂xUβ, for β = 1/2, has the same H¨older and
modulus regularity in the time variable as the L-KS SPDE gradient. Moreover, the
temporal H¨older exponent γ ր 1/2 [i.e., the temporal H¨older regularity increases]
as β ց 0. This is consistent with the similar phenomenon for the time-fractional
solutions observed by Allouba in [2].

Theorems 1.1–1.7 together answer all the questions Q1–Q5 above except that, in
the case of d = 2, extra work will be needed for completely establishing the exact
spatial moduli of continuity.

1.4. The strong local nondeterminism property and modulus of conti-
nuity. The proofs of Theorems 1.1 – 1.5 depend on the results and methods in
Meerschaert, Wang, and Xiao [34], Xue and Xiao [51] which, in turn, are based on
general Gaussian methods (cf. e.g., [29]) and the properties of strong local nonde-
terminism in [49, 50]. More speciﬁcally we obtain an expression for the spectral
measure/density associated with the solution and use it to prove the exact uniform
and local moduli of continuity.

To determine many sample path properties of our Gaussian solution U to our
SIEs separately and jointly in time and space, the following second moments of
spatial and temporal diﬀerences are crucial11:

(1.43)

σ(d)
time(s, t; x)2 = E[U (t, x) − U (s, x)]2;
σ(d)
space(t; x, y)2 = E[U (t, x) − U (t, y)]2;
σ(d)
joint(s, t; x, y)2 = E[U (t, x) − U (s, y)]2;

s, t ∈ R+, x ∈ Rd,
t ∈ R+, x, y ∈ Rd,
s, t ∈ R+, x, y ∈ Rd.

Xiao [50] gave some general conditions for eﬀectively studying several analytic and
geometric properties of Gaussian random ﬁelds. For convenience of readers, we
restate these conditions below, adapting the notation slightly to our setting. Let
Itime = [a, b] and I (d)
k=1[ak, bk] be one and d-dimensional closed intervals in
R+ and Rd, respectively12. Let γ = (γ1,··· , γd+1) ∈ (0, 1]d+1 be a ﬁxed vector,
and denote by ρ the metric on R+ × Rd given by

space = ⊗d

(1.44)

ρ(s, t; x, y) = |t − s|γ1 +

dXj=2

|xj − yj|γj ; s, t ∈ R+, x, y ∈ Rd.

(C1) (Spatio-temporal bounds) There exist positive and ﬁnite constants c2,1 and

c2,2 such that

joint(s, t; x, y)i2

for all s, t ∈ Itime and x, y ∈ I (d)

11In the case of β time-fractional SIEs, these quantities depend also on β.

Remark 1.6. In this article, γ1 is the least upper bound for the temporal H¨older
exponents for our SPDEs/SPIDEs, and γ2 = ··· = γd+1 are the least upper bound
for the spatial H¨older exponents for our SPDEs/SPIDEs. By Theorem 1.1 in Al-
louba [1, 3] γ1 = (4 − d)/8 for the L-KS SPDE and for the SPIDE (1.2) when
β = 1/2; and, by Theorem 1.2 in Allouba [2], γ1 = (2β−1 − d)/4β−1 for the SPIDE
(1.2) for β = 1/2k, k ∈ N. Also, γj = [(4 − d)/2]∧ 1, j = 2, . . . , d + 1, and d = 1, 2, 3
for all SPDEs/SPIDEs in this article by Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 [3, 2] and
by Theorem 1.1 in [1].

Remark 1.7. The main results of this article13, Theorems 1.1–1.7, establish exact
uniform and local moduli of continuity for the solutions of the L-KS SPDE and the
SPIDE in the time variable t and space variable x, separately. Also, Theorem 1.1
gives a Chung’s law of iterated logarithm for simple L-KS SPDEs. For proving
these theorems, we will only use Conditions (C1) and (C2) for two special cases:
either x = y or s = t, respectively. Hence, the spectral conditions in Xiao [49]
can be applied to verify these conditions. Moreover, Theorems 2.1 and 2.5 in [49]
allow us to prove more general properties by replacing the power functions |t− s|γ1
and |xj − yj|γj in (1.44) by regularly varying functions of |s − t| or |x − y| with
regularity exponents smaller than 1. Such an extension does not aﬀect the proofs
in Meerschaert, Wang, and Xiao [34], hence the theorems in Sections 4 and 5 of
[34] are still applicable.

Remark 1.8. It would be interesting to study analytic and geometric properties
of the solutions of L-KS SPDE and the SPIDE in both time and space variables t
and x simultaneously. For this purpose, the full strength of Conditions (C1) and
(C2) will be needed. The problems are more complicated and some new techniques
will be required. We will pursue this line of research in a separate article.

1.5. Rigorous kernel stochastic integral equations formulations. For the
L-KS SPDE (1.9), as done in [1, 5], we use the linearized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
kernel introduced in [6, 5, 1] to deﬁne their rigorous mild SIE formulation. This L-
KS kernel is the fundamental solution to the deterministic version of (1.9) (a ≡ 0),
as shown in [6, 5, 1], and is given by:

13The last result of this article is Theorem 5.1, which uses change of measure to give equivalence
in law and to transfer regularity between linear L-KS SPDEs and time-fractional SPIDEs and their
nonlinear versions, with Allen-Cahn type and polynomial nonlinearities, on compact time-space
sets.

(see [5, p. 530] and [1, Deﬁnition 1.1, Eq. (1.11)]). Of course, the mild formulation
of (1.1) is then obtained by setting a ≡ 1 and b ≡ 0 in (1.47).
For the time fractional SPIDE (1.6), we ﬁrst explain heuristically the role of
the extra time fractional integral I 1−β in the formal formulation. Succinctly, It
compensates for the β time fractional derivative C∂β
t so as to end up with a standard
stochastic integral in time term with respect to space-time white noise, and wind up
with a simpler (and smoother) SIE formulation. To see this quickly before we give
the formal computation, we ﬁrst observe heuristically that to get a formulation with
Uβ on the left hand side, we only need to get rid of the β fractional time derivative
C∂β
t to it. This means we have to apply I β
t
to the right side of the SPIDE (1.6) too. So, if we want the time integral of the
noise term to be of order 1 (nonfractional), we need to have started already with a
fractional integral I 1−β
t . To put this heuristic
on a ﬁrm ground and to get the SIE formulation of time fractional SPIDEs, we use
Umarov’s fractional Duhamel principle (see Theorem 3.6 in [46]), which we now
proceed to describe.

exactly equation (1.14) in [2]. In the important case of β = 1/2, we call (1.55) the

We end this section with three facts about the Mittag-Leﬄer function Eβ(x)
that will be applied in Section 4. The ﬁrst two give upper and lower bounds as well
as the asymptotic behavior for these important functions (see [40, Theorem 4 and
equation (6.6)]). For β ∈ (0, 1) and all x > 0, we have

and

The third Mittag-Leﬄer property we need relates to its Fourier transform, which
we give next. For clarity and convenience, we will, in the next lemma, use the
notations L[f (t)](θ) and F [f (t)](τ ) for the t 7→ θ Laplace transform and the t 7→ τ
Fourier transform, respectively.

the behavior of our SPIDEs for all 0 < β ≤ 1/2 while also representing the case

is the fundamental solution to higher order PDEs with

In this case, the radius of convergence of the Laplace transform in (2.11) is ℜ(θ) ≥ 0.
Setting σ = 0 in (2.11), we thus obtain the Mittag-Leﬄer Fourier transform in
(2.10). The proof is complete.

3. The L-KS SPDEs: Proofs of Theorems 1.1–1.3

Let U be the solution to the L-KS SPDE (1.1).

In [1], Allouba obtained the
temporal and spatial H¨older exponent γt ∈ (0, (4−d)/8) and γs ∈ (0, ((4−d)/2)∧1),
respectively, by establishing—in [1, Lemma 3.4]—the following sharp dimension-
dependent upper bounds

E [U (t, x) − U (s, x)]2q ≤ Cd |t − s|
E [U (t, x) − U (t, y)]2q ≤ Cd|x − y|2qαd ; αd ∈ Jd,

(4−d)q

for the more general nonlinear L-KS SPDE (1.9), with Lipschitz condition on a, for
all x, y ∈ Rd, for all t, s ∈ [0, T ], for q ≥ 1, for 1 ≤ d ≤ 3, and for

(3.2)

Jd =

(0, 1];
(0, 1);
(0, 1

d = 1,
d = 2,
2 ); d = 3.

These H¨older exponents determine the temporal and spatial diﬀerences expo-
nents in the temporal and spatial moduli expressions in Theorem 1.1 and Theo-
rem 1.2, respectively. They are also useful for getting a sharp upper bound for the
uniform spatio-temporal moduli of continuity for our L-KS SPDE (1.1). Rather
than complementing the upper bounds in (3.1) with corresponding lower bounds,
we take a harmonic/spectral analytic route combined with a useful decomposition
of our solution U to get the exact uniform and local moduli of continuity in Theo-
rem 1.1. This approach, which we also use for our time-fractional SPIDEs, builds
on the results of Xiao in [49, 50] and Meerschaert, Wang, and Xiao in [34].

Assume without loss of generality that u0 = 0, then the L-KS SPDE solution is

This idea of decomposition originated in Mueller and Tribe [36] in the second order
SPDEs setting; and it has been applied in Wu and Xiao [45] and in Tudor and Xiao
[44], also in the second order heat SPDE setting. See also Mueller and Wu [37] for
related results on stochastic heat equation.

We ﬁrst prove our results on the moduli of continuity for the auxiliary process
X, then using the aforementioned decomposition of U , in terms of X and a smooth
process V , we transfer them to our L-KS SPDE solution U . The following result is
pivotal.
Theorem 3.1. Assume the spatial dimension d ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Let X be as deﬁned in
(3.4) and x ∈ R be ﬁxed.

(i) The Gaussian process {X(t, x); t ≥ 0} has stationary temporal increments.

Proof. Corollary 3.1 and Theorem 2.1 in [49] imply (4.42). Corollary 3.1 and

From Corollary 3.2, the Gaussian process {X(t, x), t ≥ 0} satisﬁes conditions (C1)
and (C2) above ((A1) and (A2) in [34]). Hence we can apply the results in [34]
on the uniform and local moduli of continuity to get the following theorem on the
time regularity of X.

[34, Theorem 5.1]. The constants k(d)

x ∈ Rd since the distribution of the process {X(t, x), t ≥ 0} does not depend on x,

sup|s−t|≤ε |X(s, x) − X(t, x)| are the same. However, the method in [34] is not
enough for proving k(d)

We are now ready to use the the decomposition U (t, x) = X(t, x) − V (t, x)

(t ≥ 0), Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 to prove part (i) of Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1 (i).
In order to derive the temporal uniform modulus of
continuity for our L-KS SPDE solution process U , we use part (iii) of Theorem 3.1
to see that, almost surely, there exists ε0 > 0 such that for all 0 < ε ≤ ε0,

(3.19)

sup

s,t∈[0, ε]

|V (t, x) − V (s, x)|

|t − s|γ1plog log(1/|t − s|) ≤ C.

By splitting the interval Itime = [0, b] ⊂ R+ into [0, ε0] ∪ [ε0, b] and applying (3.19)
and part (ii) of Theorem 3.1 respectively, one can see that the solution process U
and {X(t, x), t ≥ 0} have the same exact uniform modulus of continuity on Itime.
Hence, it follows from Theorem 3.2 (i) that Theorem 1.1 (i) (a) holds almost surely.
To prove Theorem 1.1 (i) (b), we see that, for any t > 0, (1.13) follows from
part (ii) of Theorem 3.1 and part (ii) of Theorem 3.2. When t = 0, Theorem 3.2
does not imply (1.13) because the local oscillation V (t, x) at the origin may be of
the same order. We can prove (1.13) for t = 0 by using the comparison result in
Lemma 7.1.10 and Remark 7.1.11 in [29]. Since this is very similar to the proof of
Proposition 2 in [44], we omit the details. This ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 1.1
part (i).

Equation (3.28) and Theorem 2.1 in [49] imply that, for every ﬁxed t > 0, the
gradient of the L-KS SPDE solution {∂xU (t, x), x ∈ R} is spatially strongly locally
nondeterministic. More precisely, for every M > 0, there exists a ﬁnite constant
c > 0 (depending on t and M ) such that for every n ≥ 1 and for every x, y1, ..., yn ∈
[−M, M ],
(3.29)

Var [∂xU (t, x)|∂xU (t, y1), . . . , ∂xU (t, yn)] ≥ c min

0≤j≤n{|x − yj|},

where y0 = 0. Also, (3.28) and Theorem 2.5 in [49] imply the double sided second
moment bounds

(3.30)

E[∂xU (t, x) − ∂yU (t, y)]2 ≍ |x − y|;

∀x, y ∈ [−M, M ].

Thus, the uniform modulus of continuity of ∂xU in Theorem 1.2 (i) (a) follows from
Theorem 4.1 in [34]. The local modulus of continuity of ∂xU in Theorem 1.2 (i) (b)
follows upon applying [34, Theorem 5.1].

3.3.2. The fractal cases d = 2, 3. We now turn to the rougher two and three di-
mensional cases. Starting with the d = 3 case, we ﬁrst obtain the strong local
nondeterminism property and double-sided second moment bounds in space for the

L-KS SPDE solution(cid:8)U (t, x); x ∈ R3(cid:9).

Lemma 3.2 (Spatial SLND and double-sided bounds for L-KS SPDEs). For every
ﬁxed t > 0, the L-KS SPDE solution {U (t, x), x ∈ R3} is spatially strongly locally
nondeterministic. Namely, for every M > 0, there exists a ﬁnite constant c > 0

where y0 = 0. Also,

(3.32)

E[U (t, x) − U (t, y)]2 ≍ |x − y|;

∀x, y ∈ [−M, M ]3.

Proof. When d = 3, Corollary 3.3 implies that the condition (2.17) in [49] is satis-
ﬁed with α = α = γ2 = 1
2 . Hence, the conclusions in (3.31) and (3.32) follow from
Theorem 2.5 in [49] with φ(r) = r.

Now we can obtain the exact spatial uniform and local continuity moduli in

Theorem 1.2 (ii) for the three dimensional case.

Proof of Theorem 1.2 (ii). With Lemma 3.2 in hand, the uniform modulus of
continuity of U in Theorem 1.2 (ii) (a) follows from Theorem 4.1 in [34]; and the
local modulus of continuity of U in Theorem 1.2 (ii) (b) follows upon applying [34,
Theorem 5.1].

Finally we turn to the proof of the upper bounds on the uniform and local

continuity moduli in the critical two dimensional case in Theorem 1.2 (iii).

As in the proof of Theorem 1.2 (i), we assume ε = ϑ = 1 and |x − y| ≤ 1/2. Let
B1 := (cid:8)ξ ∈ R2 : |ξ| < 2(cid:9), B2 := (cid:8)ξ ∈ R2 : 2 ≤ |ξ| < 1
|ξ| ≥ 1
by using the inequalities in (3.25), one can derive

The desired upper bounds for the uniform and local continuity moduli for the sam-
ple function x 7→ U (t, x) in d = 2 follow from the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality

It is natural to expect that (1.20) and (1.21) hold with “≤” replaced by “=”,

in d = 2. However, substantial extra work is needed for proving these statements.

HASSAN ALLOUBA AND YIMIN XIAO

In particular, in order to apply the method in [34], one will have to establish the
property of strong nondeterminism for U (t,·). Unfortunately the method in [49]
does not seem useful anymore and some new ideas may be needed.

3.4. The L-KS gradient temporal H¨older and modulus of continuity. We
prove the temporal regularity of the spatial gradient ∂xU in Theorem 1.3.

Proof of Theorem 1.3.
Let d = 1. We start with the H¨older assertion for the
gradient. Recall that U (t, x) = X(t, x)− V (t, x) and that the temporal regularity of
U is totally determined by the rougher process X. Similarly, the temporal regularity
of the gradient ∂xU is entirely determined by the gradient of the rougher auxiliary
process X (∂xX)19. Here, ∂xX plays the role of the auxiliary process for ∂xU . We
start with Parseval’s identity to the integral in y to get:

and the fact that ∂xV is temporally smooth (see footnote 19) establish the H¨older
regularity assertion for ∂xU in Theorem 1.3.

Turning now to the uniform and local spatial continuity moduli results for the L-
KS gradient, ∂xU , in Theorem 1.3. Equation (3.40) means that ∂xX has stationary
increments and the spatial spectral density of ∂xX and its asymptotic behavior are
given by (3.39).

Equation (3.39) and Theorem 2.1 in [49] imply that, for every ﬁxed x ∈ R,
the gradient {∂xX(t, x), t ≥ 0} is temporally strongly locally nondeterministic.
Namely, for any T > 0, there is a positive constant c such that for all t ∈ (0, T ] and
all 0 < r ≤ 1 ∧ |t|
(3.42)

Var (∂xX(t, x)|∂xX(s, x); s ∈ [0, T ],|t − s| ≥ r) ≥ cr

As with the L-KS SPDE case, Allouba obtained in [3, 2], the time and space

intervals Jd as in (3.2). Now, we take the spectral/harmonic analysis and solution

replacing the L-KS one—to get the exact dimension-dependent temporal and spatial
uniform and local moduli of continuity in Theorem 1.4 and in Theorem 1.5.

Assume without loss of generality that u0 = 0, then the β time-fractional SPIDE

4.1. Temporal modulus. Throughout this subsection, let x ∈ Rd be ﬁxed but
arbitrary. Let Uβ be the solution to the time-fractional SPIDE (1.2), given by (4.2).
Following the template used in the L-KS proofs, we ﬁrst introduce the following
auxiliary Gaussian process {Xβ(t, x), t ∈ R+}:
(4.3)

Xβ(t, x) =ZRdZR(cid:16)K(β,d)

(t−r)+;x,y − K(β,d)

(−r)+;x,y(cid:17) W (dr × dy),

where x ∈ Rd is arbitrary but ﬁxed. Then the solution Uβ may be decomposed as
Uβ(t, x) = Xβ(t, x) − Vβ(t, x), where

Vβ(t, x) =ZRdZR−(cid:16)K(β,d)

the smoothness of Vβ.

Corollary 4.1 (Temporal SLND and double-sided bounds for Xβ). Let d ∈ {1, 2, 3}

Proof. The property of the spectral density ∆β in Theorem 4.1 (i) and Theorem
2.1 in [49] imply (4.12). Similarly, Theorem 4.1 (i) and Theorem 2.5 in [49] imply
(4.13). Finally, since the spectral density ∆β is regularly varying of order −(2− βd
2 )
at ∞, the last conclusion of the corollary follows from Theorem 1 in [38].

From Corollary 4.1, conditions (C1) and (C2) above ((A1) and (A2) in [34]) hold.
Now, applying the results in [34] on the uniform and local continuity moduli for
the auxiliary Gaussian processes to {Xβ(t, x), t ≥ 0}, we get the following theorem
on the time regularity of Xβ. Recall that H = 2−βd
Theorem 4.2. Let x ∈ Rd, d = 1, 2, 3, be ﬁxed; let 0 < β ≤ 1/2; and let
{Xβ(t, x), t ≥ 0} be deﬁned as in (4.3) above. Then,

[34, Theorem 5.1]. The constant k(β,d)
(i = 6, 7) do not depend on x ∈ Rd since
the distribution of the process {Xβ(t, x), t ≥ 0} does not depend on x, see (3.14).

Now we use the decomposition Uβ(t, x) = Xβ(t, x) − Vβ(t, x) to prove Theo-

rem 1.4 (i).

Proof of Theorem 1.4 (i).

As in the proof of of Theorem 1.1 (i), we see that

(1.25) and (1.26) follow from the aforementioned decomposition and Theorems 4.1
and 4.2.

4.2. Time-fractional SPIDEs are not bifractional Brownian motions. Let
Uβ be the solution to the time-fractional SPIDE (1.2), given in (4.2). We now
characterize the law of {Uβ(t, x); t ≥ 0}—which we call the β time-fractional SPIDE
law—and we show that, unlike the L-KS SPDE, it’s fundamentally diﬀerent from
the bifractional Brownian motion law.

Proof of Theorem 1.4 (ii).

For any 0 < s < t, we use Parseval’s identity to get

4.3.2. Spectral asymptotics for the critical fraction β = 1/2. Since the second in-

does not work for the case β = 1/2. The reason, as is clear from Theorem 1.5 and
Theorem 1.6, is that the case β = 1/2 has a rougher modulus than that of β < 1/2.
This is captured in the following lemma.

This proves (4.24). The last conclusion follows from the above proof by using the

where the last equality follows from a change of variable in the integral dξ (or the

fractional SPIDEs gradient, ∂xUβ, for γ ∈ (0, 1/2) and 0 < β < 1/2. For the
critical β = 1/2 case in Theorem 1.6 (i), we use the last statement in Lemma 4.3

for all x, y ∈ R with |x − y| ≤ 1/2, where the last inequality follows from a change

Turning now to the exact uniform and local spatial continuity moduli of the
β-time-fractional SPIDEs ∂xUβ, in Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.6 (i) (a) and (b).

Combining the property of the spectral density eSβ in (4.28) and Theorems 2.1

and 2.5 in [49], we can verify that the following hold: Given any constant M > 0,
there exists a ﬁnite constant c > 0 (depending on t and M ) such that for every

n ≥ 1 and for every x, y1, ..., yn ∈ [−M, M ],
(4.31)

Var [∂xUβ(t, x)|∂xUβ(t, y1), . . . , ∂xUβ(t, yn)] ≥ c min

ϕβ(|x − yj|),

where y0 = 0, and ϕβ is deﬁned on (0,∞) by
(4.32)

if 0 < β < 1/2,
if β = 1/2.

ϕβ(r) =(cid:26) r;

r| log r|,

Also,

E[∂xUβ(t, x) − ∂xUβ(t, y)]2 ≍ ϕβ(|x − y|);

(4.33)
Hence, {∂xUβ(t, x), x ∈ R} satisﬁes Condition (C1) and (C2) (or slight variants
when β = 1/2). Consequently, the desired uniform continuity in (i) (a) of Theo-
rems 1.5 and 1.6 follow from Theorem 4.1 in [34]. The local modulus of continuity
of ∂xUβ Theorems 1.5 and 1.6 (i) (b) follow upon applying [34, Theorem 5.1], com-
pleting the proof of Theorems 1.5 and 1.6 part (i).

∀x, y ∈ [−M, M ].

We now turn to the rougher spatial regularity in two and three dimensional
fractal cases for the SPIDEs (1.2). First, we start with the d = 3 case in Theorems
1.5 and 1.6 (ii), for the cases 0 < β < 1/2 and β = 1/2, respectively.

The following lemma provides the strong local nondeterminism property and
double-sided second moment bounds in space for the β-time-fractional SIPDE so-

lution(cid:8)Uβ(t, x); x ∈ R3(cid:9).
solution (cid:8)Uβ(t, x); x ∈ R3(cid:9) is spatially strongly locally nondeterministic. Namely,

Lemma 4.4 (Spatial SLND and double-sided bounds for time-fractional SPIDEs).
Suppose 0 < β ≤ 1/2 and d = 3. For every ﬁxed t > 0, the time-fractional SIPDE
for every M > 0, there exists a ﬁnite constant c > 0 (depending on t and M ) such
that for every n ≥ 1 and for every x, y1, ..., yn ∈ [−M, M ]3,
Var [Uβ(t, x)|Uβ (t, y1), . . . , Uβ(t, yn)] ≥ c min
(4.34)
0≤j≤n
where y0 = 0 and the function ϕβ is deﬁned in (4.32). Also,

ϕβ(|x − yj|),

E[Uβ(t, x) − Uβ(t, y)]2 ≍ ϕβ(|x − y|);

(4.35)
Moreover, as |x − y| → 0, “≍” in (4.35) can be replaced by ∼ [up to a constant
factor].

∀x, y ∈ [−M, M ]3.

Proof. The conclusions in (4.34) and (4.35) follow from Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 to-
gether with Theorems 2.1 and 2.5 in [49]. Finally, the last statement of the lemma
follows from (4.22), (4.24) and Theorem 1 of Pitman [38].

Next, we prove the results on spatial uniform and local continuity moduli in

Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.6 (ii)-(iii).

Proof of Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.6 part (ii)-(iii). With Lemma 4.4 in hand,

follow from Theorem 4.1 in [34]; while the local modulus of continuity of Uβ in both
Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.6 (ii) (b) follow upon applying [34, Theorem 5.1].

To prove part (iii) of Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.6, we start by deriving sharp
upper bounds for E[Uβ(t, x) − Uβ(t, y)]2. This is similar to the proof of Theorem
1.2 (iii), which can be obtained by using the upper bounds for the spectral density
function Sβ in Lemma 4.2 and 4.3, respectively. More precisely, we can verify that

(4.36)

E[Uβ(t, x) − Uβ(t, y)]2 ≤ c(cid:26) |x − y|2;

for all x, y ∈ R with |x − y| ≤ 1/2. In the above, c ∈ (0,∞) is a constant. The rest
of the proof is similar to that of part (iii) of Theorem 1.2 and is omitted.

Theorem 1.7.

Proof of Theorem 1.7.
Let d = 1. We start with the H¨older assertion for the
gradient. Recall Uβ(t, x) = Xβ(t, x) − Vβ (t, x), where Xβ is the rougher process.
Proceeding as in the proof of Theorem 1.3 for L-KS SPDEs, Parseval’s identity
applied to the integral in y gives

It follows that ∂xXβ(·, x) is γ-H¨older continuous in time, with γ ∈(cid:0)0, (2β−1 − 3)/4β−1(cid:1).

This, together with the gradient decomposition

(4.41)
and the fact that ∂xVβ is temporally smooth21 establish the H¨older regularity as-
sertion for ∂xUβ in Theorem 1.3.

∂xUβ(t, x) = ∂xXβ(t, x) − ∂xVβ(t, x),

Turning now to the uniform and local spatial continuity moduli results for the
time-fractional SPIDE gradient, ∂xUβ, in Theorem 1.7. Equation (4.40) means that
∂xXβ has stationary increments and the spatial spectral density of ∂xXβ and its
asymptotic behavior are given by (4.39).

Equation (4.39) and Theorem 2.1 in [49] imply that, for every ﬁxed x ∈ R,
the gradient {∂xXβ(t, x), t ≥ 0} is temporally strongly locally nondeterministic.
Namely, for any T > 0, there is a positive constant c such that for all t ∈ (0, T ] and
all 0 < r ≤ 1 ∧ |t|
(4.42)

Var (Xβ(t, x)|Xβ(s, x); s ∈ [0, T ],|t − s| ≥ r) ≥ cr

Thus, the uniform modulus of continuity of ∂xXβ

sertions for the gradient ∂xUβ in Theorem 1.7 follow from those of the auxiliary
process ∂xXβ ((4.44) and (4.45)), the decomposition (4.41), and the smoothness of
∂xVβ (see footnote 21).

21As in the L-KS SPDE case, it can be shown that the smoothness assertions in Theorem 4.1
(ii) and (iii) (with (H = 2β−1 − 3)/4β−1) hold for ∂xV . Since the proof follows the same steps
as the one for Theorem 3.1 (ii) and (iii) with straightforward modiﬁcations, we leave it to the
interested reader.

5. From linear to time-fractional Allen-Cahn and Swift-Hohenberg

equations via measure change

We quickly remark in this section that, at their core, the space-time change of
measure theorems in [10, 9, 8] are “noise” results that are independent of both the
type and order of the SPDE under consideration. This makes them conveniently
adaptable to diﬀerent SPDEs settings. As was done in [1] for L-KS SPDEs, we can
extend the results in [9, 8] to our β-time-fractional SPIDEs (1.2). The almost sure
L2 condition in [9, 8, 1], which is much weaker than the usual Novikov condition
typically found in change-of-measure results, allows us to state an equivalence in
law—and thus in all almost sure regularity results—between both (1.1) and (1.2)
and their nonlinear versions the Swift-Hohenberg SPDEs

as the linear L-KS SPDE on T × S. The same uniqueness assertion holds for
the β-time-fractional Allen-Cahn SPIDE (5.2) and (5.3). Also, the law—and
hence the H¨older continuity and the continuity modulus regularity—equivalence

The proof of the uniqueness and law equivalence assertions for L-KS SPDEs (in
both the Allen-Cahn nonlinearity b (5.3) and the general polynomial b cases) was
given in [1, Theorem 1.3 and Corollary 1.1]. The proof is exactly the same for the
linear-to-nonlinear time-fractional SPIDEs case, and we omit it24.

6. Concluding remarks

6.1. Time-fractional SPIDEs are diﬀerent from time fractional SPDEs
and their equivalent high-order memoryful SPDEs. Here, we make a brief
but important distinction that was emphasized in [2, 3], and that the astute reader
will note. For completeness, we incorporate the SPIDE coinage of our present paper
here in making our point, which we now state and discuss. The time-fractional
SPIDEs (1.6) are not equivalent to (their rigorous SIEs formulation (1.55) are not
the mild form of) their rougher and fundamentally diﬀerent relatives: (1) the time-

limits of continuous time random walks and which is reviewed, along with its link
to k-iterated Brownian-time Brownian motion, in [2].

In [3], Allouba showed that in the case β = 1/2 (the Brownian-time Brownian
motion case), the β-time-fractional SIE in (1.55) is not the mild formulation of
the β = 1/2 of (6.2); but rather it is an integral formulation of what he called
parametrized BTBM SPDE, evaluated at the diagonals (see [3] pp. 428–431, Lemma
1.2, and footnote 3 p. 416 for the details). Similarly, as stressed in [2], for general
β ∈ {1/2k; k ∈ N}, the β-time-fractional SIE in (1.55) is not the mild formulation of
(6.2). This is contrary to what was erroneously stated in [35]. Thus, unfortunately,

24The pathwise uniqueness, and hence uniqueness in law, of solutions trivially follows in the

linear b ≡ 0 case from the mild formulation.

HASSAN ALLOUBA AND YIMIN XIAO

Theorem 4 of [35] claiming the equivalence between the time-fractional SPIDE25
(1.6)—corresponding to the rigorous SIE form (1.55)—and the memoryful high
order SPDEs (6.2) is incorrect. In fact, in [2] it was repeatedly emphasized that
the β-time-fractional SIE in (1.55) (and hence its corresponding SPIDE (1.6)) is
a diﬀerent and smoother stochastic version of the deterministic PDEs—obtained
by setting a ≡ 0 in either (6.1) or (6.2)—than the rougher equivalent SPDEs (6.1)
and (6.2) (see the discussions in [2] right before equations (1.4) and (1.8) and the
discussion following equation (1.15), including footnote 15).

The formal SPDEs in (6.1) and (6.2) require rigorous formulations quite diﬀerent
from (1.55). This is handled, and the equivalence between (6.1) and (6.2) for
suitably regular initial data u0, is shown in an upcoming separate article. Of
course, even formally, it is obvious that the time-fractional SPIDEs (1.6) are not
equivalent to the time-fractional SPDEs (6.1), which lack the fractional integral
and its smoothing eﬀect.

6.2. Other remarks.
Further properties on the local times and fractal be-
havior of the solution process for both L-KS SPDEs and time-fractional SPIDEs
{U (t, x), x ∈ Rd}, when t > 0 is ﬁxed, can now be derived from [48, 49, 50]. It
is also possible to investigate sample path properties of the Gaussian random ﬁeld
{U (t, x), t ≥ 0, x ∈ Rd} in both time and space variables. We will carry out this in
subsequent work.
