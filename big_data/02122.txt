Optically trapped nanospheres in high-vaccum experience little friction and hence are promising
for ultra-sensitive force detection. Here we demonstrate measurement times exceeding 105 seconds
and zeptonewton force sensitivity with laser-cooled silica nanospheres trapped in an optical lattice.
The sensitivity achieved exceeds that of conventional room-temperature solid-state force sensors by
over an order of magnitude, and enables a variety of applications including electric ﬁeld sensing,
inertial sensing, and gravimetry. The particle is conﬁned at the anti-nodes of the optical standing
wave, and by studying the motion of a particle which has been moved to an adjacent trapping site,
the known spacing of the anti-nodes can be used to calibrate the displacement spectrum of the
particle. Finally, we study the dependence of the trap stability and lifetime on the laser intensity
and gas pressure, and examine the heating rate of the particle in vacuum without feedback cooling.

Sub-attonewton force sensing facilitates a variety of ap-
plications including magnetic resonance force microscopy
[1], tests of gravitational physics at short range [2, 3],
investigations of surface forces including the Casimir
eﬀect [4], as well as inertial sensing [5].
State-of-
the-art resonant solid state mechanical sensors such as
micro-cantilevers, nano-membranes, and nanotubes typ-
ically operate in a cryogenic environment to improve
their thermal-noise limited force sensitivity. Room-
temperature solid-state sensors have achieved sensitivity
in the ∼ 10− 100 aN/Hz1/2 range [6–10], while cryogenic
nanotube mechanical oscillators have recently achieved
∼ 10 zN/Hz1/2 [11]. The excellent environmental de-
coupling of optically levitated mechanical systems [12–
17, 19] in high vacuum can allow such systems to achieve
similar or better force sensitivity at room temperature
[17, 18, 20]. However, a challenge has been the optical
conﬁnement of such particles under high vacuum [18, 21–
23], in particular in standing-wave optical traps [16, 24].

In this paper we describe robust optical trapping of
300 nm silica nanospheres in an optical lattice at high
vacuum, where particles can be trapped indeﬁnitely over
several days. The optical potential allows the particle to
be conﬁned in a number of possible trapping sites. By
perturbing the system with a laser, we are able to trans-
fer the particle between diﬀerent trap anti-nodes, which
shows promise for sensing experiments where the particle
position must be adjusted and controlled precisely [3]. By
studying the motion of a particle which has been moved
to an adjacent trapping site, the known spacing of the
lattice anti-nodes can also serve as a ruler to calibrate
the displacement spectrum of the particle. While elec-
tric ﬁelds can be used to calibrate the force sensitivity of
charged microspheres [23, 25], the standing wave method
can be a useful calibration tool for neutral objects, which
are applicable for a variety of experiments where charge
can produce unwanted backgrounds. We ﬁnd that for
a charged particle the standing-wave method produces

results consistent with the electric ﬁeld method.

Using active-feedback laser cooling in three dimen-
sions, we demonstrate cooling of the center of mass mo-
tion to ∼ 400 mK at a pressure of 5×10−6 Torr, resulting
in a force sensitivity of 1.6 aN/Hz1/2. The system per-
mits time-averaged measurements over long integration
times, and we demonstrate force sensing at the 6 zN level.
Due to the reduced particle size and improved imaging
and feedback cooling, these results are more than two
orders of magnitude more sensitive that those previously
reported by our group using 3 µm particles in a dual-
beam optical dipole trap [23].

Finally, we study the dependence of the trap stability
and lifetime on laser intensity and background gas pres-
sure, and measure the heating rate of the particle in high
vacuum in the absence of optical feedback cooling. We
ﬁnd stable trapping for a range of intensities that are lim-
ited by the trapping depth on one hand and the internal
heating of the particle on the other.

In addition to force sensing applications, stable op-
tically trapped nanospheres at high vacuum are also
promising for quantum information science [12, 13],
tests of classical and quantum thermodynamics [22],
testing quantum superpositions [26–28], quantum opto-
mechanics with hybrid systems [29], matter wave inter-
ferometers [30–34], and gravitational wave detection [35].
Experimental Setup. A schematic of the experimental
setup is shown in Fig. 1. A 300 nm fused silica sphere
is trapped using two equal-power counter-propagating
beams formed by splitting a 1064 nm laser beam with
a polarizing cube beam splitter. The beam foci are oﬀset
axially by 75 µm. The trap is initially operated with a
total power of 2.2 W and a waist size of approximately
8 µm, and the trap is loaded by vibrating a glass sub-
strate to aerosolize beads under 5 − 10 Torr of N2 gas,
which provides suﬃcient damping to slow and capture
the particles. More detail of the vacuum system has been
previously described in Ref. [23].

ity using either a derivative or phase shifter circuit. The
phase shifted signals are used to adjust the RF ampli-
tude of three acoustic optical modulators (AOMs), which
modulate the intensity of a 780 nm laser beam to provide
a velocity-dependent optical damping force in each direc-
tion. Such feedback has proven necessary for maintaining
the particle in the trap while pumping to high-vacuum.
The feedback light is focused onto the sphere using a lens
outside of the vacuum chamber in the horizontal direc-
tion, one of the dipole trap lenses for the axial direction,
and an in-vacuum lens for the vertical direction.

Prior to pumping to high vacuum, the center-of-mass
temperature as derived from the position spectrum of the
beads is largely independent of pressure and trap laser
power for suﬃciently high pressure and suﬃciently low
laser intensity. We can thus assume the bead is in ther-
mal equilibrium with the background gas at and above
2 Torr. This allows us to determine a scale factor to
convert the quadrant photodetector voltage into a dis-
placement. From this conversion factor we can deduce
the force sensitivity of the bead at lower vacuum con-
ditions. As a check of the scale factor, the bead can be
transferred between adjacent trapping sites by applying a
perturbation with a laser. In this case we utilize the feed-
back cooling laser in a driving mode. In Fig. 1c we show
the time trace of a bead subject to a perturbation which
causes it to transition between adjacent trapping sites.
A calibration is made possible using the half-wavelength
spacing of the trap antinodes, along the axial direction
of the trap. From the ﬁt to thermal spectra, the mea-
sured displacement of this transition is 514 ± 43 nm, in
reasonable agreement with the expected value of 532 nm.
Force Measurement. At high vacuum, time-averaged
sub-aN force measurements can be performed. The mini-
mum force detectable for a harmonic oscillator in thermal
equilibrium with a bath at temperature T is

where b is the measurement bandwidth, S1/2

tor. In the absence of laser cooling, Eq. 1 can be writ-

cooling, the temperature in Eq. 1 becomes Teﬀ and the
damping rate Γeﬀ includes the eﬀect of the cooling laser.
We perform force measurements in the x−direction.
Data for the bead position and a reference signal (typi-
cally at 9 kHz) are recorded with a sampling rate of 125
kHz. Fig. 2 shows a typical displacement spectral den-

nm beads is formed using counter-propagating 1064 nm laser
beams focused at nearly the same spatial location. Active
feedback cooling is performed using 780 nm lasers (shown as
green) in 3 dimensions.
(b) Calculated optical force along
the z−axis assuming total power of 2.2 W, waist of 8 µm,
and a 0.2% intensity modulation due to interference from the
counter-propagating beam, corresponding well with the mea-
sured trap frequencies. (c) Time-trace for 1 s of particle mo-
tion in the axial direction at P = 2 Torr. When subject to
an applied sinusoidal optical force, the particle hops to an
adjacent trapping site as a result of the perturbation. Dotted
lines indicate expected antinode spacing.

The polarizing cube beam splitter transmits approxi-
mately 1.5 percent of the p-polarized laser power along
the s-beam path due to imperfect polarization separa-
tion. This p-polarized component can interfere with the
anti-parallel p-polarized beam to create a standing wave
potential, as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The optical poten-
tial results from the superposition of the scattering and
dipole forces from the beams and includes a modulation
produced by the interference. The intensity modulation
depends on the coherence length of the laser as well as
the purity of the beam polarizations.

The position of the nanosphere is measured by imaging
the scattered light from the nanosphere onto two quad-
rant photodetectors (QPDs). We deﬁne the “axial” or z−
axis in the direction of the dipole trap beams, and the
“horizontal” or x− axis is perpendicular to both the ver-
tical and axial axes. The axial-horizontal (vertical) mo-
tion is measured using QPD 1 (2). The position signals
from the QPDs are phase shifted by 90 degrees to provide
a signal proportional to the bead’s instantaneous veloc-

2 Torr with no feedback cooling applied, and a spectrum
at high vacuum (HV) of 5 × 10−6 Torr with feedback
cooling. At 2 Torr we observe an x-resonant frequency
of 2830 Hz and gas damping rate of approximately 1.4
kHz. In the orthogonal directions (y−, z−) (not shown)
resonance frequencies of (3410, 7300) Hz are observed,
respectively. At HV, a lorentzian ﬁt to the data reveals
cooling of the center of mass motion to 460±60 mK, with
a damping rate of 460 ± 49 Hz in the x−direction. CM
motion in the y− and z−directions are cooled to tem-
peratures of 610 ± 190 mK and 7.9 ± 3 K, with damping
rates of approximately 1.3 kHz and 1 kHz, respectively.
The frequencies of the peaks are shifted when feedback
cooling is applied due to the optical spring eﬀect that
occurs if the feedback phase is not precisely 90 degrees.
The force sensitivity in the x−direction corresponds to
F,x = 1.63 ± 0.37 aN/Hz1/2, with the error dominated
S1/2
by the uncertainty in the particle size. The lowest at-
tainable temperature appears to be limited by noise in
the QPD imaging electronics and trapping laser. The
expected sensitivity at this pressure would be approxi-
mately ∼ 10 times better in the absence of laser noise
and cross-talk between feedback channels.

In the absence of an applied force, we expect the signal
due to thermal noise to average down as b1/2. This be-
havior is shown in Fig. 2 for averaging times exceeding
105 seconds. Force sensing at the level of 5.8 ± 1.3 zN is
achievable at this timescale. Also shown is the calculated
Fmin using the measured parameters for Teﬀ , ω0, and Γeﬀ ,
which agree with measured data within uncertainty. We
ﬁnd that approximately 90% of the beads trapped have
zero electric charge; the remaining beads tend to have
only 1 or 2 excess electrons. Data are shown for charged
(1e−, 2e−) and uncharged beads in Fig. 2 for a known
applied electric ﬁeld. The expected force for a charge of
1 (2) electrons is shown as a dotted line in Fig. 2. An in-
dependent calibration can be achieved by comparing the
spectra of the beads after they have been transported to
adjacent trapping sites in the optical lattice, as discussed
previously. The determined calibration factors are con-
sistent in each case within experimental uncertainty.

Trap Stability and Lifetime. In the absence of applied
feedback cooling, the particle is lost from the trap as
the pressure is dropped below the 10 mTorr range. Fig
3a illustrates statistics for the typical trap loss pressure
for beads without feedback cooling applied, as a func-
tion of trapping laser intensity, along with previous data
obtained for 3 µm diameter beads [23]. Following a sim-
ilar analysis to that presented in Ref. [23], we ﬁnd that
radiometric forces may also be a likely loss mechanism
for the smaller beads. The expected temperature gradi-
ent across the sphere is signiﬁcantly reduced for the 300
nm sphere however, consistent with the lower loss pres-
sures. Once HV is attained, we can reduce the optical
feedback cooling rate by over an order of magnitude com-

pared with what is used while pumping from 2 Torr to
HV, and maintain the trap stability. This suggests that
gas collisions play a role in the loss mechanism around
∼ 10 mTorr. While larger beads tend to be lost at higher
pressures for increasing intensity, the 300 nm beads tend
to get lost at higher pressures for decreasing intensity.
This diﬀerence may be due to the reduced trap depth for
the smaller particles.

The trap lifetime at high vacuum at intensities around
1010 W/m2 is typically indeﬁnite over several days, how-
ever at higher intensity we notice an exponential reduc-
tion of lifetime with increasing laser power, as shown in
Fig. 3c. The estimated timescale to reach thermal equi-
librium in each case is less than 1 s, as shown in Fig. 3d,
despite lifetimes ranging from minutes to a few hours.
Here we consider a range of possible values for the imag-
inary permittivity 2, varying from the bulk silica value
2 = 2.5× 10−7 [36] up to 2 = 10−6, an upper bound we
infer from holding particles for several seconds at inten-
sities above 2 × 1010 W/m2 without particle evaporation
or loss. The exact loss mechanism shown in Fig. 3c is
uncertain. A process whereby the particle may undergo
annealing or a glass-crystalline transition after remaining
at an elevated temperature for a signiﬁcant time could be
responsible for loss if the new phase has higher absorp-
tion or if the bead experiences a kick due to a sudden
change in density, size, or refractive index. Annealing is
reported for certain forms of silica at temperatures as low
as 500 K over 30 minute timescales [37].

To evaluate the trap heating rate we study the mo-

tion in high vacuum after the optical feedback cooling
has been turned oﬀ (Fig. 4). As the amplitude increases
we observe discrete transitions of the bead between ad-
jacent lattice sites before the bead is ejected from the
trap. From an exponential ﬁt to the envelope of the aver-
aged variance we infer a heating timescale of ∼ 200 mHz.
The expected heating rate from gas collisions ΓM is ap-
proximately 3.4 mHz, while the calculated photon-recoil
heating rate is approximately 100× slower. Thus an ad-
ditional heating mechanism is present which can include
contributions from laser noise and non-conservative scat-
tering forces [38]. Given the measured cooling rates, the
achieved minimal temperatures are roughly as expected
with the measured heating rate.

Discussion. We have demonstrated zN level force sens-
ing using nanospheres in a standing-wave optical trap
with integrated measurement times exceeding 105s. The
known spacing of the lattice anti-nodes can serve as
a ruler to calibrate the displacement spectrum of un-
charged particles, which are often desirable in precision
measurements, including Casimir force studies and grav-
itational experiments. The ultimate force sensitivity is
limited theoretically at low pressure due to photon recoil
heating [20] and measurement backaction noise [18]. In
practice our sensitivity is limited by technical laser noise
and noise in the imaging electronics. By using cavity
assisted displacement readout or by improving the nu-
merical aperture of the imaging system, along with us-

ing near shot-noise limited detection electronics and im-
proved laser intensity stabilization, ∼ 100× colder center-
of-mass temperatures and an order of magnitude better
force sensitivity should be possible at these pressures. In
this system it should also be possible to study multiple
trapped particles, allowing investigations of interaction
eﬀects such as optical binding [39].
