A CHARACTERIZATION OF GORENSTEIN PLANAR GRAPHS

TRAN NAM TRUNG

Abstract. We prove that a planar graph is Gorenstein if and only if its indepen-
dence complex is Eulerian.

Introduction

Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on the vertex set V = {1, . . . , n} where n (cid:62) 1. Thus,
∆ is a collection of subsets of V closed under taking subsets; that is, if σ ∈ ∆ and
τ ⊆ σ then τ ∈ ∆. Let k be a ﬁeld and R = k[x1, . . . , xn] a polynomial ring over
k. Let I∆ be the ideal of R generated all square-free monomials xi1 ··· xis such that
{i1, . . . , is} /∈ ∆, i.e. a non-face of ∆; this is called the Stanley-Reisner ideal of ∆.
Then, we say that ∆ is Cohen-Macaulay (resp. Gorenstein) over k if so is R/I∆.
One of the main problem is to characterize the Cohen-Macaulay and the Gorenstein
property of ∆ from the combinatorial data of ∆ (see [12]). For example, let |∆| denote
the underlying topological space of ∆, as deﬁned in topology. Then, ∆ is Gorenstein
whenever |∆| is isomorphic to a sphere according to [12, Corollary 5.2]. In general,
these properties depend on the characteristic of the base ﬁeld k (see [11, 3]).

We now move on to ﬂag complexes. A simplicial complex is a ﬂag complex if all
of its minimal non-faces are two element sets. Equivalently, if all of the edges of a
potential face of a ﬂag complex are in the complex, then that face must also be in the
complex. Flag complexes are closely related to graphs. All graphs we consider in this
paper are ﬁnite, not null and simple without isolated vertices.
Let G be a graph with vertex set V (G) = {1, . . . , n} and edge set E(G). An
independent set in G is a set of vertices no two of which are adjacent to each other.
The independence complex of G, denoted by ∆(G), is the set of independent sets of
G. We now associate to the graph G a quadratic squarefree monomial ideal in R

I(G) = (xixj | ij ∈ E(G)),

which is called the edge ideal of G (see [15]). We can see that

I∆(G) = I(G),

and thus ∆(G) is a ﬂag complex. Conversely, any ﬂag complex is the independence
complex of some graph. We say that G is Cohen-Macaulay (resp. Gorenstein) over k
if so is R/I(G).

A graph G is called well-covered if very maximal independent set has the same size,
that is α(G), the independence number of G. A well-covered graph G is said to be a
member of the class W2 if G\ v is well-covered with α(G\ v) = α(G) for every vertex
v (see [10, 14]). At ﬁrst sight, if G is Gorenstein then G is in W2 (see [7, Lemma
2.4]).
In general we cannot read oﬀ the Gorenstein property of a graph just from
its structure since this property as usual depends on the characteristic of k (see [7,
Proposition 3.1]), so now we focus on some classes of graphs such as (see [4, 6, 7]):
(1) A bipartite graph is Gorenstein if and only if it is consists of disjoint edges.
(2) A chordal graph is Gorenstein if and only if it is consists of disjoint edges.
(3) A triangle-free graph is Gorenstein if and only if it is a member of W2.
The main theme of this paper is to characterize Gorenstein graphs among planar
graphs. A graph which can be drawn in the plane in such a way that edges meet
only at points corresponding to their common ends is called a planar graph. In fact
we deal with a larger class of graphs which we call pseudo-planar graphs. Before
stating the result we need some terminology from Graph theory. Two vertices which
are incident with a common edge are adjacent, and two distinct adjacent vertices are
neighbors. The set of neighbors of a vertex v in a graph G is denoted by NG(v). An
independent set in G is a set of vertices no two of which are adjacent to each other.
The independence complex of G, denoted by ∆(G), is the set of independent sets of
G. For S ∈ ∆(G) we denote the neighbors of S by

NG(S) := {x ∈ V (G) \ S | NG(x) ∩ S (cid:54)= ∅}

and the localization of G with respect to S by GS := G \ (S ∪ NG(S)). Let G[NG(v)]
be the induced subgraph of G on the neighbors of v. When we remove all isolated
vertices of G[NG(v)], the order of the remaining graph denoted by δ∗(v). Let

δ∗

(G) := min{δ∗

(v) | v ∈ V (G)}.

The union of m copies of disjoint graphs isomorphic to G is denoted by mG. The
join of two disjoint graphs G and H is denoted by G ∗ H. The complete graph on
n vertices is denoted by Kn. In order to generalize the notion of triangle-free graphs
and planar graphs we deﬁne pseudo-planar graphs as follows:
Deﬁnition 0.1. A graph G is pseudo-planar if every S ∈ ∆(G) satisﬁes:

(1) δ∗(GS) (cid:54) 5;
(2) GS is not isomorphic to 2K2 ∗ 2K2.
Let G be a graph and ∆ := ∆(G). From Lemmas 1.1 and 1.2, we see that G is

(i) For all F ∈ ∆ and all i < dim(lk∆ F ), we have (cid:101)Hi(lk∆ F ; k) = 0; and

Gorenstein if and only if:

(ii) ∆ is Eulerian.
The main result of the paper shows that the combinatorial condition (ii) implies
the algebraic condition (i) whenever G is pseudo-planar. In other words, we have a
characterization of pseudo-planar graphs (and so of planar graphs, see Remark 1.8):

Theorem 3.7 Let G be a pseudo-planar graph. Then, G is Gorenstein if and only if
∆(G) is Eulerian.

The paper is organized as follows. In the section 1 we set up some basic notations,
terminology for graph and the simplicial complex. In the section 2, we compute the
Euler characteristics of the independence complexes of locally Gorenstein graphs. In
the last section we characterize Gorenstein pseudo-planar graphs.

1. Preliminaries

Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on the vertex set V (∆) = {1, . . . , n}. We deﬁne the
Stanley-Reisner ideal of the simplicial complex ∆ to be the squarefree monomial ideal

I∆ = (xj1 ··· xji | j1 < ··· < ji and {j1, . . . , ji} /∈ ∆) in R = k[x1, . . . , xn]

and the Stanley-Reisner ring of ∆ to be the quotient ring k[∆] = R/I∆. Then, ∆ is
Cohen-Macaulay (resp. Gorenstein) if k[∆] is Cohen-Macaulay (resp. Gorenstein).
If F ∈ ∆, we deﬁne the dimension of F ∈ ∆ to be dim F = |F| − 1 and the
dimension of ∆ to be dim ∆ = max{dim F | F ∈ ∆}. The link of F inside ∆ is its
subcomplex:

lk∆ F = {H ∈ ∆ | H ∪ F ∈ ∆ and H ∩ F = ∅}.

For each i, let (cid:101)Ci(∆; k) the vector space over k whose basis elements are the exterior
j0 < ··· < ji. The reduced chain complex of ∆ over k is the complex (cid:101)C•(∆; k) whose
products eF = ej0 ∧ ··· ∧ eji that correspond to i-faces F = {j0, . . . , ji} ∈ ∆ with
diﬀerentials ∂i : (cid:101)Ci(∆; k) −→ (cid:101)Ci−1(∆; k) is given by
i(cid:88)
(−1)sej0 ∧ ··· ∧(cid:98)ejs ∧ ··· ∧ eji,
and the i-th homology group of ∆ is (cid:101)Hi(∆; k) = ker(∂i)/ im(∂i+1). For simplicity, if
ω ∈ (cid:101)Ci(∆; k), we write ∂ω stands for ∂iω. With this notation we have
∂(ω ∧ ν) = ∂ω ∧ ν + (−1)i+1ω ∧ ∂ν for all ω ∈ (cid:101)Ci(∆; k) and ν ∈ (cid:101)Cj(∆; k).

∂i( ej0 ∧ ··· ∧ eji) =

The most widely used criterion for determining when a simplicial complex is Cohen-
Macaulay is due to Reisner (see [12, Corollary 4.2]), which says that links have only
top homology.
Lemma 1.1. ∆ is Cohen-Macaulay over k if and only if for all F ∈ ∆ and all

Let fi be the number of i-dimensional faces of ∆. Then the reduced Euler charac-

i < dim(lk∆ F ), we have (cid:101)Hi(lk∆ F ; k) = 0.

of ∆ by:

(cid:101)χ(∆) =

(−1)i dimk (cid:101)Hi(∆; k).

d(cid:88)

i=−1

The restriction of ∆ to a subset S of V (∆) is ∆|S := {F ∈ ∆ | F ⊆ S}. The star
of a vertex v in ∆ is st∆(v) := {F ∈ ∆ | F ∪ {v} ∈ ∆}. Let core(V (∆)) := {x ∈
V (∆) | st∆(x) (cid:54)= V (∆)}, then the core of ∆ is core(∆) := ∆|core(V (∆)). If ∆ = st∆(v)
for some vertex v, then ∆ is a cone over v. Thus ∆ = core(∆) means ∆ is not a cone.
Let ∆ be a pure simplicial complex, i.e. every facet of ∆ has the same cardinality.

We say that ∆ is an Euler complex if

(cid:101)χ(lk∆ F ) = (−1)dim lk∆ F for all F ∈ ∆;

and ∆ is a semi-Euler complex if lk∆(x) is an Euler complex for all vertex x.

We then have a criterion for determining when Cohen-Macaulay complexes ∆ are

Gorenstein due to Stanley (see [12, Theorem 5.1]).

Lemma 1.2. ∆ is Gorenstein if and only if and only if core(∆) is an Euler complex
which is Cohen-Macaulay.

Let S be a subset of the vertex set of ∆ and let ∆ \ S := {F ∈ ∆ |F ∩ S = ∅}, so
that ∆ \ S is a subcomplex of ∆. If S = {x}, then we write ∆ \ x stands for ∆ \ {x}.
Clearly, ∆ \ x = {F ∈ ∆ | x /∈ F}.

The following lemma is the key to investigate Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complexes

in the sequence of this paper (see [7, Lemma 1.4]).

Lemma 1.3. Let ∆ be a Gorenstein simplicial complex with ∆ = core(∆). If S is a

subset of V (∆) such that ∆|S is a cone, then (cid:101)Hi(∆ \ S, k) = 0 for all i.

Let G be a graph. Then, G is well-covered if and only if ∆(G) is pure; and ∆(G) =
core(∆(G)) if and only if G has no isolated vertices. The independence number of
G, denoted by α(G), is the cardinality of the largest independent set in G. Then,
dim(∆(G)) = α(G) − 1.

For any independent set S of G we have ∆(GS) = lk∆(G)(S). Therefore, GS is

Cohen-Macaulay (resp. Gorenstein) if so is G by Lemma 1.1 (resp. Lemma 1.2).

We collect here some basic facts about well-covered graphs that will be used in the

sequel.

Lemma 1.4. [2, Lemma 1] If G be a well-covered graph and S is a an independent
set of G then GS is well-covered. Moreover, α(GS) = α(G) − |S|.
Lemma 1.5. If a graph G is in W2 and S is an independent set of G, then GS is in
W2 whenever |S| < α(G).
Proof. Follows immediately by induction on |S| and using [9, Theorem 5].

(cid:3)

We say that G is locally Cohen-Macaulay (resp. Gorenstein) if Gv is Cohen-

Macaulay (resp. Gorenstein) for all vertices v.

4

Lemma 1.6. [7, Lemma 2.3] Let G be a locally Gorenstein graph in W2 and let S
be a nonempty independent set of G. Then we have GS is Gorenstein and ∆(GS) is
Eulerian with dim(∆(GS)) = dim(∆(G)) − |S|.

A vertex v of a well-covered graph G is called extendable if G\ v is well-covered and

α(G \ v) = α(G). Thus, G is in W2 if and only if every its vertex is extendable.
Lemma 1.7. Let G be a graph with at least two vertices. If ∆(G) is semi-Eulerian,
then G is in W2.

Proof. We prove the lemma by induction on α(G). If α(G) = 1, then G is a complete
graph, and then G is in W2 as |V (G)| (cid:62) 2.
Assume that α(G) (cid:62) 2. Since ∆(G) is semi-Eulerian, G is well-covered. Assume
on contrary that G is not in W2, so that G has a nonextendable vertex, say v. By [2,
Corollary 2.1] there would be an nonempty independent set S of G such that v is an
On the other hand, by Lemma 1.4 we have α(GS) = α(G) − |S| < α(G). Thus,

isolated vertex of GS. In particular, (cid:101)χ(∆(GS)) = 0.

∆(GS) = lk∆(G)(S) is Eulerian because ∆(G) is semi-Eulerian. It follows that

(cid:101)χ(∆(GS)) = (−1)dim ∆(GS ) (cid:54)= 0,

a contradiction. Hence, every vertex of G is extendable, and hence G is in W2.

Remark 1.8. A planar graph is a pseudo-planar graph.

(cid:3)

In order to see this we recall a criterion on deciding whether a given graph is
planar. A minor of a graph G is any graph obtainable from G by means of a sequence
of vertex and edge deletions and edge contractions. Alternatively, consider a partition
(V0, V1, . . . , Vm) of V (G) such that G[Vi] is connected, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) m, and let H be the
graph obtained from G by deleting V0 and shrinking each induced subgraph G[Vi],
1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) m, to a single vertex. Then any spanning subgraph of H is a minor of
G. A minor which is isomorphic to K5 or K3,3 is called a Kuratowski minor. Then,
Wagner’s theorem (see [1, Theorem 10.3]) says that: G is planar if and only if G has
no Kuratowski minor.
If G be a planar graph and S ∈ ∆(G), then GS is an induced subgraph of G, and
hence it is planar. By [1, Corollary 10.22] we deduce that δ∗(GS) (cid:54) 5. Moreover, if
∼= 2K2 ∗ 2K2, then we can see that GS would have a minor K3,3, a contradiction.

It follows that G is pseudo-planar.

Proof. Let d := dim(∆). We prove the lemma by induction on d. If d = −1, then
∆ = {∅}, and the lemma holds for this case.
If d = 0, then ∆ consists of isolated vertices, say x1, . . . , xn, where n = |V (G)|. We

(cid:101)χ(lk∆(F )) =(cid:101)χ(lk∆({∅})) +

Assume that d (cid:62) 1. Let F1, . . . , Ft be the facets of ∆. We may assume that
dim(Fi) = d for all i = 1, . . . , s; and dim(Fi) < d for all i = s + 1, . . . , t; with
1 (cid:54) s (cid:54) t. We now proceed to prove by induction on s. If s = 1, let Λ = ∆ \ {F1}.
Because dim Λ = dim ∆ − 1 = d − 1, by the induction hypothesis we have

so(cid:80)

Proposition 2.2. Let G be a graph such that ∆(G) is semi-Eulerian. Let v be a
vertex of G and d := dim(∆(G)). Then,

(cid:101)χ(∆(G)) = (−1)d(1 +(cid:101)χ(∆(G[N (v)]))).

Proof. We prove by induction on d.
In this case, G is
a complete graph, so G = Kn where n = |V (G)|. Let v be a vertex of G. Then,
G[N (v)] = Kn−1. Hence,

(cid:101)χ(∆(G)) = −1 + n and (cid:101)χ(G[N (v)]) = −1 + (n − 1) = −2 + n,

If d = 0, then α(G) = 1.

and hence the proposition holds.

Assume that d (cid:62) 1 so that α(G) (cid:62) 2. By Lemma 1.7 we have G is in W2, in

particular G is well-covered. Let ∆ := ∆(G) and A := N (v). Let

As a consequence we have.

ing conditions are equivalent:

(1) =⇒ (2): Since ∆ is Eulerian,

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

(1) ∆(G) is Eulerian;

(2) (cid:101)χ(∆(G[N (v)])) = 0 for every vertex v of G;
(3) (cid:101)χ(∆(G[N (v)])) = 0 for some vertex v of G.
(cid:101)χ(∆) = (−1)d. By Proposition 2.2 we have
so that (cid:101)χ(∆(G[N (v)])) = 0.

Proof. Let ∆ = ∆(G) and d := dim(∆(G)).

(cid:101)χ(∆) = (−1)d = (−1)d(1 +(cid:101)χ(∆(G[N (v)])),
(cid:101)χ(∆) = (−1)d(1 +(cid:101)χ(∆(G[N (v)])) = (−1)d.

we have

(2) =⇒ (3): Obviously. (3) =⇒ (1): Since ∆ is semi-Eulerian, by Proposition 2.2

Together with the semi-Eulerian property of ∆, it follows that ∆ is Eulerian.

3. Gorenstein Pseudo-Planar Graphs

In this section, we will prove that if G is a pseudo-planar graph such that ∆(G) is

Eulerian then G is Gorenstein. We start when α(G) is small.
Lemma 3.1. Let G be a pseudo-planar graph with α(G) (cid:54) 2. If ∆(G) is Eulerian
then G is Gorenstein.
Proof. If α(G) = 1, then G ∼= Kn where n = |V (G)|. In this case we have

(cid:101)χ(∆(G)) = −1 + n.

Since ∆(G) is Eulerian, we get n = 2. Hence, G is Gorenstein.

Assume that α(G) = 2. By Lemma 1.2, it remain to show that G is Cohen-
Macaulay. For any vertex v, note that α(Gv) = 1 and ∆(Gv) is Eulerian. Therefore,
Gv is Gorenstein as in the previous case. By Lemma 1.1 we have ∆(G) is Cohen-
Macaulay if

(cid:101)H−1(∆(G); k) = (cid:101)H0(∆(G); k) = 0.

8

Since ∆(G) has at least one vertex, we have (cid:101)H−1(∆(G); k) = 0. In order to prove
(cid:101)H0(∆(G); k) = 0 it suﬃces to show ∆(G) is connected.
Assume on contrary that ∆(G) is disconnected. Then we would have two proper
subgraphs of G, say G1 and G2, so that α(G1) = α(G2) and G = G1 ∗ G2.
Let v be any vertex of G. Since Gv is an edge, we have degG(v) = n − 3. Hence, G
is (n−3)-regular. As G[N (v)] is connected and G is pseudo-planar, we have n−3 (cid:54) 5,
and hence n (cid:54) 8.
that υ(G1) (cid:62) 4 and the equality occurs if and only if G1
and the equality occurs if and only if G2

For every vertex u of G1 we have Gu = (G1)u, therefore (G1)u is an edge. It implies
∼= 2K2. Similarly, υ(G2) (cid:62) 4
∼= 2K2
∼= 2K2. Consequently, G ∼= 2K2 ∗ 2K2. This contradicts the pseudo-planar
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.2. Let G be a locally Gorenstein graph in W2, X an independent set of
G and an integer i < dim(∆(G)). Then for all ω ∈ Ci(∆(G); k) with ∂ω = 0 can be
written as ω = ∂η + ω(cid:48) where η ∈ Ci+1(∆(G); k) and ω(cid:48) ∈ Ci(∆(G) \ X; k).
Proof. The lemma is trivial if X = ∅, so we assume that X (cid:54)= ∅. Let ∆ := ∆(G). We
represent ω as:

ω =

eS ∧ ωS

where ωS ∈ Ci−|S|(∆(GS \ X); k).

If there is ∅ (cid:54)= F ⊆ X such that ωF (cid:54)= 0, then we take such an F such that |F| is

maximal. By Equation (1) we get

∂ω =

Lemma 3.3. Let G be a locally Gorenstein graph in W2. Let v be a vertex and let
H := G[N (v)]. Assume that there is an independent set X of H such that for every
nonempty independent sets S of H \ X we have either HS has an isolated vertex or

HS is empty. Then (cid:101)Hi(∆(G); k) = 0 for all i < dim(∆(G)).

Proof. Let ∆ := ∆(G) and d := dim(∆(G)). We ﬁrst claim that

(cid:101)Hi−|S|(∆(GS) \ V (H); k) = 0 for any ∅ (cid:54)= S ∈ ∆(H) \ X.
by Lemma 1.1 we get (cid:101)Hi−|S|(∆(GS) \ V (H); k) = (cid:101)Hi−|S|(∆(GS); k) = 0.
Indeed, observe that GS is Gorenstein because G is locally Gorenstein. By Lemma
1.6 we have α(GS) = d − |S|. If HS is empty. Since i − |S| < d − |S| = dim(∆(GS)),
By Lemma 1.3 we get (cid:101)Hi−|F|(∆(GS) \ V (H); k) = (cid:101)Hi−|F|(∆(GF \ V (HS)); k) = 0, as
If HS is not empty, then HS has an isolated vertex, and so ∆(GS)|V (HS ) is a cone.

Note that ∆(G) \ V (H) = st∆(v) and (cid:101)Hi(st∆(v); k) = 0. Since ∂(ω(cid:48) − ∂η(cid:48)) =

Together with ω = ∂η + ω(cid:48), we obtain ω = ∂(η + η(cid:48) + ξ), as required.

∂ω(cid:48) − ∂2η(cid:48) = 0, there is ξ ∈ Ci+1(st∆(v); k) ⊆ Ci+1(∆; k) such that ω(cid:48) − ∂η(cid:48) = ∂ξ, and
hence ω(cid:48) = ∂(η(cid:48) + ξ).

Remark 3.4. If G[N (v)] has an isolated vertex, say x, then the set X = {x} satisﬁes
all conditions in the lemma 3.3.

A graph is totally disconnected if there is no path connecting any pair of vertices.

Lemma 3.5. Let G be a graph with at most 5 vertices and (cid:101)χ(∆(G)) = 0. Assume

that for any independent set X of G there is a nonempty independent set S of G \ X
such that neither GS has an isolated vertex nor GS is empty. Then G must be either
a pentagon with only one chord or a two 3-cycles with only one vertex in common.

Proof. Observe that G has no isolated vertices by the assumption. Let n := |V (G)|.
We consider four possible cases:

Case 1: n = 2. In this case G is an edge, but then (cid:101)χ(∆(G)) = 1.
Thus, G is either a 3-cycle or a 3-path, but (cid:101)χ(∆(G)) (cid:54)= 0 in both cases.
case, (cid:101)χ(∆(G)) = −1. Hence, we assume that G is connected. Now if G has a 3-cycle

Case 3: n = 4. If G is disconnected, then G must be two disjoint edges. In this

Case 2: n = 3. We imply that G is connected since G has no isolated vertices.

C3, let x be a vertex not lying on C3. Then for every nonempty independent set S
of G \ x, we see that GS is either just x or empty. Thus, G has no any 3-cycles, and
thus either G has a 4-cycle or G is a tree. If G has a 4-cycle, then GS is just one
vertex or empty for all nonempty independent set S of G. If G is a tree, then let X
be the set of leaves of G. Observe that |X| (cid:62) 2, so that GS is either empty or totally
disconnected for any non-empty independent set S of G \ X.

Case 4: n = 5. If G is disconnected, then G has just two components of size 2 and
3. Therefore, G is either an edge and a triangle or and edge and a 3-path. In both
V (G) = {a, b, c, d, e}.

cases, we can see that (cid:101)χ(∆(G)) (cid:54)= 0. Hence, we assume that G is connected. Let
If G has a 5-cycle C5, so that α(G) (cid:54) 2. Note that(cid:101)χ(∆(C5)) = −1, so G must have
at least one chord. If G has only one chord, then (cid:101)χ(G) = 0. If G has at least two
chords, then f1(∆(G)) (cid:54) 3, and then (cid:101)χ(∆(G)) = −1 + 5 − f1(∆(G)) > 0. It follows

that G have only one chord.

If G has no any 5-cycles, but it has a 3-cycle C3. Assume that E(C3) = {ab, bc, ca}.
Since G is connected, we may assume that d is adjacent to a. If e is not adjacent
to d, then {e, d} is an independent set of G. In this case, GS is totally disconnected
for any nonempty independent set S of G \ {d, e}. Thus, e is must be adjacent to d.
Since G has no 5-cycles, e is adjacent to neither b nor c. Now if e is not adjacent to

a, then we have (cid:101)χ(∆(G)) = 1. Hence, e is adjacent to a, and hence G is two 3-cycles
with only one vertex in common. Note that (cid:101)χ(∆(G)) = 0 for that graph G.

If G has neither 3-cycles nor 5-cycles, then either G has only 4-cycles or G is a tree.
If G has a 4-cycle, say C4. We may assume that E(C4) = {ab, bc, cd, da}. Since G is
connected, we may assume that e is adjacent to a. Since G has neither 3-cycles nor
5-cycles, the edge set of G is just {ab, bc, cd, da, ae}. Then, {c, e} is an independent
subset of G and GS are totally disconnected for any nonempty independent set S of
G \ {d, e}.

then (cid:101)χ(∆(G)) = −1, hence G has at least three leaves. Let X be the set of leaves of

Finally, G is a tree. If G has exactly two leaves, then G must be the 5-path. But
G, in particular, X is an independent set of G. Since G \ X is connected and has at

11

most two vertices, therefore GS is totally-disconnected for all nonempty independent
sets S of G \ X.

In summary, G is either a 5-cycle with only one chord or a two 3-cycles with only
(cid:3)

one vertex in common.

A pure simplicial complex ∆ of dimension d is called connected in codimension
one if for any two facets F and H of ∆, there exists a sequence of facets F =
F0, F1,··· , Fp−1, Fp = H such that |F i ∩ Fi+1| = d for each i. By using the same
argument as in the proof of [5, Theorem 9.1.12] we obtain.
Lemma 3.6. Let G be a well-covered graph with α(G) (cid:62) 2. If G is locally Cohen-
Macaulay and ∆(G) is connected, then ∆(G) is connected in codimension one.

We now in a position to prove the main result of this paper.

Theorem 3.7. Let G be a pseudo-planar graph without isolated vertices. Then G is
Gorenstein if and only if ∆(G) is Eulerian.

Proof. If G is Gorenstein. As G has no isolated vertices, we have ∆(G) = core(∆(G)),
so ∆(G) is Eulerian by Lemma 1.2.
Conversely, Assume ∆(G) is Eulerian. By Lemma 1.7 we have G is in W2. We now
prove by induction on α(G) that G is Gorenstein. If α(G) (cid:54) 2, the assertion follows
from Lemma 3.1.
Assume that α(G) (cid:62) 3. Let ∆ := ∆(G) and d := dim(∆) = α(G) − 1. Since ∆ is
Eulerian, by Lemma 1.2 we have ∆ is Gorenstein if ∆ is Cohen-Macaulay. Now for
every vertex x of G we have Gx is well-covered with α(Gx) = α(G)− 1 by Lemma 1.4.
As ∆(Gx) is Eulerian, by the induction hypothesis we have Gx is Gorenstein. This
yields G is locally Gorenstein. Thus, By Lemma 1.1 we have ∆ is Cohen-Macaulay if

(cid:101)Hi(∆; k) = 0 for all i < d.

(4)

Let v be a vertex of G such that δ∗(v) is minimal and let H := G[N (v)]. If H
has an isolated vertex, then the equation (4) holds by Lemma 3.3. Therefore, we
assume that H has no isolated vertices, and therefore H has at most 5 vertices by the
pseudo-planar property of G.

Since ∆ is Eulerian, by Lemma 2.3 we have(cid:101)χ(∆(H)) = 0. By Lemmas 3.3 and 3.5,

the equation (4) holds except for H is either a pentagon with only one chord or a two
3-cycles with only one vertex in common. We next prove the equation (4) holds for
such two exceptional graphs H.
If H is a pentagon with one chord, assume that V (H) = {x, y, z, s, t} and E(H) =
{xy, yz, zs, st, tx, ys} (see Figure 1). Let ω ∈ Ci(∆(G); k) such that ∂ω = 0. We will
prove that ω is a boundary. Let X := V (H). First we claim that

Figure 1. A pentagon with one chord.

Indeed, since {z, t} is an independent set of G, by Lemma 3.2 we can write ω as
ω = ∂η + ψ where η ∈ Ci+1(∆; k) and ψ ∈ Ci(∆ \ {z, t}; k) with ∂ψ = 0. We next
write ψ as

(6)

ψ = ex ∧ es ∧ ψxs + ex ∧ ψx + ey ∧ ψy + es ∧ ψs + ψ(cid:48)

where

ψxs ∈ Ci−2(∆(G{x,s}); k); ψx, ψy, ψs ∈ Ci−1(∆ \ X; k); and ψ(cid:48) ∈ Ci(∆ \ X; k).

As ∂ψ = 0, from (6) we imply that ∂ψxs = 0. Since G is well-covered and locally

Gorenstein, G{x,s} is Gorenstein with

Since i − 2 < dim(∆(G{x,s})), (cid:101)Hi−2(∆(G{x,s}); k) = 0 by Lemma 1.1. This gives

dim(∆(G{x,s})) = dim(∆(G)) − 2 = d − 2.

ψxs = ∂ηxs for some ηxs ∈ Ci−1(∆(G{x,s}); k). Together with (6) we have

ψ − ∂(ex ∧ es ∧ ηxs) = ex ∧ (ψx + ηxs) + ey ∧ ψy + es ∧ (ψs − ηxs) + ψ(cid:48).

Let φx := ψx + ηxs and φs := ψs − ηxs. Then φx, φs ∈ Ci−1(∆ \ X; k) and

ψ − ∂(ex ∧ es ∧ ηxs) = ex ∧ φx + ey ∧ ψy + es ∧ φs + ψ(cid:48).

Combining with ∂(ψ − ∂(ex ∧ es ∧ ψxs)) = 0, we get ∂ψy = 0. Note that t is an vertex
of Gy and ∆(Gy) is Gorenstein with core(∆(Gy)) = ∆(Gy). By Lemma 1.3 we have

(cid:101)Hi−1(∆(Gy) \ t; k) = 0. Therefore, ψy = ∂ωy for some ωy ∈ Ci(∆(Gy) \ t; k). This

yields

(7)

ψ + ∂(−ex ∧ es ∧ ηxs + ey ∧ ωy) = ex ∧ φx + es ∧ φs + (ωy + ψ(cid:48)

we get ∂φx = 0. Because z is a vertex of Gx, (cid:101)Hi−1(∆(Gx)\{z}; k) = 0 by Lemma 1.3.

Since ωy + ψ(cid:48) ∈ Ci(∆ \ X; k) and ∂(ψ + ∂(−ex ∧ es ∧ ψxs + ey ∧ ωy)) = 0, from (7)
Note that φx ∈ Ci−1(∆(Gx) \ {z}; k), so φx = ∂ωx for some ωx ∈ Ci(∆(Gx) \ {z}; k).
Together with (7) we have

(8)

ψ + ∂(−ex ∧ es ∧ ηxs + ex ∧ ωx + ey ∧ ωy) = ωx + es ∧ φs + (ωy + ψ(cid:48)

).

Observe that ωx ∈ Ci(∆(Gx) \ {z}; k) ⊆ Ci(∆ \ (X \ {s}); k), thus we can write

ωx = es ∧ ηs + η(cid:48)

where ηs ∈ Ci−1(∆(Gs)\ X; k) and η(cid:48) ∈ Ci(∆\ X; k). By substituting it into the right
hand sinde of (8) we get

ψ + ∂(−ex ∧ es ∧ ηxs + ex ∧ ωx + ey ∧ ωy) = es ∧ (φs + ηs) + (ωy + ψ(cid:48)

Let ζ := η + ex ∧ es ∧ ηxs − ex ∧ ωx − ey ∧ ωy, ωs := φs + ηs and ω(cid:48) := ωy + ψ(cid:48) + η(cid:48).

Together with (6) we obtain ω = ∂η + es ∧ ωs + ω(cid:48), and the claim (5) follows.

We now go back to prove that ω is a boundary. Together ∂ω = 0 with (5) we get
∂ωs = 0. Since Gs is Gorenstein without isolated vertices and that x is a vertex of
Gs, by Lemma 1.3 we get Hi−1(∆(Gs)\{x}; k) = 0. As ωs ∈ Ci−1(Gs\{x}), ωs = ∂γs

ω = ∂(η − es ∧ γs) + (γs + ω(cid:48)

Ci+1(∆ \ X; k) ⊆ Ci+1(∆; k). This gives ω = ∂(η − es ∧ γs + γ), so ω is a boundary.

so (cid:101)Hi(∆ \ X; k) = 0. Since γs + ω(cid:48) ∈ Ci(∆ \ X; k), γs + ω(cid:48) = ∂γ for some γ ∈

For the remain case, H is a two 3-cycles with only one vertex in common, assume
that V (H) = {x, y, z, s, t} and E(H) = {xy, yz, zx, ys, st, ty} (see Figure 2). We ﬁrst

the same argument as in the claim (5) we can write ω as

(cid:101)Hi−1(∆(Gs) \ z; k) = 0 by Lemma 1.3. Note that ωs ∈ Ci−1(∆(Gy) \ z; k), therefore

Since ∂ω = 0, from (11) we deduce that ∂ωs = 0. Since z is a vertex of Gs,

ωs = ∂γs for some γs ∈ Ci(∆(Gs) \ z; k). Thus,

ω = ∂(ζ − es ∧ γs) + γs + ω(cid:48).

Note that V (Gs \ z) ∩ X = {x}, so we can write γs = ex ∧ ψx + φ where ψx ∈

Ci−1(∆(G{x,s}); k) and φ ∈ Ci(∆(G) \ X; k). Then,

Ci(∆(G{x,s}); k). Together with (12) we obtain

ω = ∂(ζ − es ∧ γs − ex ∧ φx) + (φ − φx + ω(cid:48)

).

Combining with ∂ω = 0 we have ∂(φ − φx + ω(cid:48)) = 0. On the other hand, as
γ ∈ Ci+1(∆ \ X; k). This gives ω = ∂(ζ − es ∧ γs − ex ∧ φx + γ), so ω is a boundary.

φ − φx + ω(cid:48) ∈ Ci(∆ \ X; k) and (cid:101)Hi(∆ \ X; k) = 0, we have φ − φx + ω(cid:48) = ∂γ for some
It follows that (cid:101)Hi(∆; k) = 0 for all i < d − 1.
Finally we prove (cid:101)Hd−1(∆; k) = 0. Since (cid:101)Hi(∆; k) = 0 for all i < d − 1, the Euler
(−1)i dimk (cid:101)Hi(∆; k) = (−1)d−1 dimk (cid:101)Hd−1(∆; k) + (−1)d dimk (cid:101)Hd(∆; k).
(cid:101)χ(∆) =
Note that(cid:101)χ(∆) = (−1)d, so dimk (cid:101)Hd−1(∆; k) = dimk (cid:101)Hd(∆; k)−1. On the other hand,
(cid:101)H0(∆; k) = 0 because 0 < d− 1, therefore ∆ is connected. As G is locally Gorenstein,

characteristic of ∆ now becomes

by Lemma 3.6 we have ∆ is connected in codimension one. Now let F be any face of ∆
with dim F = d− 1 so that |F| = α(G)− 1. Since ∆(GF ) is Eulerian with α(GF ) = 1,
GF is just one edge of G, say uv. This means that F is the common face of exactly
two facets F ∪ {u} and F ∪ {v} in ∆. Hence, ∆ is a d-dimensional pseudomanifold

without boundary (see [12, Deﬁnition 3.15]), and hence dim (cid:101)Hd(∆; k) (cid:54) 1 by [12,
Proposition 3.16]. Consequently, dimk (cid:101)Hd−1(∆; k) = dimk (cid:101)Hd(∆; k)− 1 (cid:54) 0. It follows
that dimk (cid:101)Hd−1(∆; k) = 0, so (cid:101)Hd−1(∆; k) = 0. The proof is complete.

Since a planar graph is a pseudo-planar graph, by using Theorem 3.7 we obtain a
graph-theoretical characterization of Gorenstein planar graphs. Note that a charac-
terization of Gorenstein triangle-free planar graph is obtained in [8].

Corollary 3.8. A planar graph is Gorenstein if and only if its independence complex
is Eulerian.

We conclude this paper with a simple construction of Gorenstein graphs and Goren-

stein pseudo-planar graphs from the given ones (it is similar to Pinter [9]).

Proposition 3.9. Let H be a Gorenstein graph and let x be a non isolated vertex of
H. Let the three new points be a, b and c. Join a to b and every neighbor of x; join b
to c; and join c to x. Let G be the graph obtained from this construction. Then,

(1) G is a Gorenstein graph with α(G) = α(H) + 1.
(2) G is pseudo-planar if H is pseudo-planar.

Proof. We may assume that H has no isolated vertices so that H is in W2. We prove
the proposition by induction on α(H). If α(H) = 1, then H = K2. In this case, G is
just a pentagon, so the proposition holds.

15

∼= H, and the claim holds.

claim holds

holds

Assume that α(H) (cid:62) 2. We ﬁrst prove G is Gorenstein. Let v be an arbitrary
vertex of G. We now claim that Gv is Gorenstein with α(Gv) = α(H) and without
isolated vertices. Indeed, observe that if v /∈ {a, b, c, x} ∪ NH(x) then v ∈ V (Hx). We
consider the four possible cases:

Case 1: v ∈ {b, c}. Gv
Case 2: v ∈ {a, x}. Gv is isomorphic to the disjoint union of Hx and K2, and the
Case 3: v ∈ NH(x). Gv is the disjoint union of Hv and the edge bc, and the claim
Case 4: v ∈ V (Hx).

In this case, x is a vertex of Hv. Since H is in W2, x is
not an isolated vertex in Hv. In this case Gv is exactly the graph obtained by the
construction in the lemma that starts with Hv. Since α(Hv) = α(H) − 1, by the
induction hypothesis we have Gv is Gorenstein with α(Gv) = α(Hv) + 1 = α(H).
Notice that Gv has no isolated vertices. This proves the claim.

We now turn to prove that G is Gorenstein. By the claim, G is semi-Euler and
locally Gorenstein. Since G[NG(b)] is just two isolated vertices a and c, we have

(cid:101)χ(∆(G[NG(b)]) = 0. By Corollary 2.3 we have ∆(G) is Eulerian. By Lemmas 1.1
and 1.2, G is Gorenstein if (cid:101)Hi(∆(G); k) = 0 for i < dim(∆(G)). This follows from

Lemma 3.3 since G[NG(b)] is totally-disconnected. Thus, G is Gorenstein. Clearly,
α(G) = α(Gb) + 1 = α(H) + 1.

Assume that H is pseudo-planar. We next prove that G is pseudo-planar as well.

Let S be arbitrary independent set of G. We need to prove that:

(1) δ∗(GS) (cid:54) 5; and
(2) GS (cid:54)∼= 2K2 ∗ 2K2.
Observe that each vertex of 2K2 ∗ 2K2 has degree 5. Since degG(b) = degG(c) = 2,

two conditions above satisfy if either b or c is a vertex of GS.
either a, x ∈ S or S ∩ {b, c} (cid:54)= ∅.

Hence, we may assume that both b and c are not vertices of GS. It follows that
If a, x ∈ S, then let S(cid:48) := S \ {a}. Observe that S(cid:48) ∈ ∆(H) and GS = HS(cid:48), hence
two conditions satisfy in this case.
If either b or c in S. By symmetry in G, we may assume that b ∈ S. Let S(cid:48) := S\{b}.
Then, S(cid:48) ∈ ∆(H) and GS = HS(cid:48), hence two conditions also satisfy in this case. The
(cid:3)
proof of the proposition is complete.

Example 3.10. Start with R3 (the name is due to [10]), we have the following Goren-
stein pseudo-planar graph (see Figure 3). Note that the obtained graph is not planar
because it has a minor K5.
