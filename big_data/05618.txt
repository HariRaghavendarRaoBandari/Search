(Dated: March 18, 2016)

Topological triangulations of orientable and non-orientable surfaces with arbitrary genus have
important applications in quantum geometry, graph theory and statistical physics. However, until
now only the asymptotics for 2-spheres are known analytically, and exact counts of triangulations are
only available for both small genus and small triangulations. We apply the Wang-Landau algorithm
to calculate the number N (m, h) of triangulations for several order of magnitudes in system size m
and genus h. We verify that the limit of the entropy density of triangulations is independent of genus
and orientability and are able to determine the next-to-leading and the next-to-next-to-leading order
terms. We conjecture for the number of surface triangulations the asymptotic behavior

INTRODUCTION

Triangulations of manifolds provide a standard method
of discretizing surfaces in condensed matter and a pos-
sibility to quantize space-time. They are used in the
simplicial quantum gravity models of dynamical triangu-
lations [1], the causal version thereof [2], as well as in
spin-foams [3]. Furthermore they are also a fundamental
object within the group ﬁeld theory approach to quantum
gravity [4–6], which can be seen to relate the previously
mentioned approaches. For the simplicial quantum ge-
ometry models it is crucial to know the scaling of the
number of triangulations in terms of the system size, be-
cause on the one hand the statistical models are only
well-deﬁned if there exists an exponential scaling, and
on the other hand the scaling constant determines the
value of the coupling constant to obtain a phase transi-
tion necessary for results independent of the introduced
discretization scale [1, 2]. Even if triangulations are not
seen as a tool for regularization as in simplicial quantum
geometry, but as the actual relevant degrees of freedom
as in the spin-foam or the group ﬁeld theory approach,
the asymptotics of the number of triangulations in terms
of the system size is important for the measure term of
the path integral.

For rooted triangulations of the 2-sphere it is well-
known that their number scales ∝
, with m be-
ing the number of triangles [7]. A triangulation is rooted
by marking some vertex as well as some adjacent edge
and face as special in order to break symmetry and to
simplify the counting procedure. For standard triangula-
tions the same result was obtained later by proving that
the ratio of triangulations possessing any non-trivial sym-
metry vanishes for large triangulations [8]. For other sur-
faces with diﬀerent genus or orientability, like the torus or
the projective plane, no asymptotic numbers are known,
neither for the rooted nor for the default, unrooted case.

FIG. 1. (Color online) Examples for triangulations of surfaces
with low genus. (Left, red) Triangulation of the 2-sphere with
m = 50 maximal simplices.
(Right, blue) Triangulation of
the torus (orientable surface with genus g = 1 with m = 200
maximal simplices.

Nevertheless, for simplicial quantum gravity triangula-
tions of arbitrary surfaces are important, because the
models are not restricted to a certain topology of the
underlying manifold.

Triangulations of surfaces with non-vanishing genus
are also an object of study in other branches of physics:
Since every graph is planar if embedding into a surface
with arbitrary high genus, and triangulations are the
maximal planar graphs for the respective surfaces (every
insertion of an edge would violate the planarity), they are
an important tool in graph and network theory [9–11].
Furthermore, critical properties of statistical systems de-
ﬁned on quantum surfaces or triangulated manifolds are
sometimes easier to solve than on Euclidean lattices, but
can be related to these using the KPZ-formula [12–14].

Using lexicographic enumeration it is possible to
exactly count triangulations of orientable and non-
orientable surfaces for small genus g ≤ 6 and small num-
ber of vertices v ≤ 23 [15–17]. For bigger genera or larger
triangulations this method does not give results in any

reasonable computation time.

In contrast to triangulations, the asymptotic behavior
of (triangular) maps on surfaces is far better understood.
A triangular map is a graph drawn on a surface so that
each face is a triangle, the main diﬀerence to triangula-
tions is that triangular maps allow for digons, multiple
edges or loops. One can show that the asymptotic num-
ber T (k, h) (orientable) and P (k, h) (non-orientable) of
certain classes of maps on arbitrary surfaces with has the

form [18] (cid:20)T (k, h)

(cid:21)

where k is the number of edges and h = g (orientable)
respectively h = g/2 (non-orientable) is the type of the
surface. The constants th and ph do only depend on h
and not on the class of maps that are counted, they were
calculated in Ref. [19] using a recursion relation obtained
in Ref. [20]. The numbers α, β and γ depend on the class
of surfaces, one ﬁnds e.g. γ = 12 for all maps [21] or
γ = 22/3√3 for triangular maps [22].

In this paper we numerically approximate the number
of surfaces triangulation in terms of the genus g and the
number of triangles m using the Wang-Landau algorithm
[23, 24] for several orders of magnitude in g and m. A
similar version of this method was used in Ref. [25] to
approximate the number of lattice triangulations. We
are able to extract the long sought asymptotics for the
number of triangulations of arbitrary surfaces for the ﬁrst
time and ﬁnd an exponential growth that coincides with
the one found for spheres in Ref. [8]. Additionally, we
determine the sub-exponential corrections similar to Eq.
(1), which are a valuable hint for mathematicians prov-
ing the exact asymptotics for the number of surface tri-
angulations. The presented method is not limited to es-
timating the total number of surface triangulations, but
can also be used for estimating the asymptotics of the
cardinality for certain subclasses of these triangulations.
A possible application can be estimating the asymptotic
number of irreducible triangulations, which are triangula-
tions without contractible edges (see Ref. [26] for detailed
deﬁnition, and Ref. [15] for enumerations of small irre-
ducible triangulations). Furthermore, our method can
also be applied to k-equivelar or k-covered triangulations,
where in the former every vertex has degree k and in
the latter there is at least one vertex with degree k (see
Refs. [27, 28] for detailed discussion and numbers for few
vertices), and to much more diﬀerent subclasses of trian-
gulations.

II. CONSTRUCTION OF TRIANGULATIONS

First we present the deﬁnition of triangulations of
(closed) surfaces M by using the notion of simplicial com-

plexes. Let I be a set and K ⊂ 2I a set of subsets of
I. K is an abstract simplicial complex if it is complete

number of vertices.

⊂ σ ⇒ σ(cid:48)

(σ ∈ K, σ(cid:48)
∈ K) and closed under the for-
mation of intersections (σ1, σ2 ∈ K ⇒ σ1 ∪ σ2 ∈ K).
A triangulation T of the two-dimensional surface M is
an abstract simplicial complex K equipped with an geo-
metric realization (coordinization of every element of I)
that is homeomorph to M . Since the topology of a closed
surface is determined only by its Euler characteristic, or
equivalently by its genus and orientability [29], this is
also true for the topology of their triangulations.

Triangulations of orientable and non-orientable sur-
faces with arbitrary genus g (cid:54)= 0 can be constructed in
terms of an arbitrary triangulation of the torus T (ori-
entable surface with g = 1) or the projective plane P
(non-orientable surface with g = 1), using the connected
sum #. Triangulations of the torus and the projective
plane can be found e.g.
in Ref. [30]. The connected
sum of two triangulated surfaces is created by easily be
removing a triangle from each triangulation and gluing
the boundary together. A (non-)orientable surface with
genus g can then be constructed by taking the g-fold con-
nected sum T#T# . . . #T (P#P# . . . #P ) of the torus
(projective plane). A triangulation of the 2-sphere, which
is the orientable surface with g = 0, is given by the
boundary of a 3-simplex.

In order to create all possible triangulations of a sur-
face M with given genus and orientability we introduce
some elementary steps called Pachner moves [31] (which
are modiﬁcation of Alexander moves [32]) that preserve
the topology of the underlying manifold M and allow to
ergodically create every triangulation of M from every
other triangulation of M .
In two-dimensions there are
three diﬀerent Pachner moves (see Fig. 2): The ﬁrst in-
serts a vertex into a triangle (insertion move), its inverse
step removes a three-valent vertex from the triangulation
(removal move). The third step replaces one diagonal
of a quadrangle with the other triangle (diagonal-edge
move) and is it’s own inverse.
In two-dimensions the
diagonal-edge moves are ergodic for the subset of trian-
gulations with same number or vertices v, if choosing v
large enough [33, 34].

In order to construct a triangulation of a orientable or
non-orientable surface of given genus g and given number
of vertices v or number of triangles m, we ﬁrst create a
triangulation with the proper genus by taking the con-
nected sum of tori or projected planes as described above.
If the number of triangles in this triangulation is smaller
than m, we perform insertion moves until the number of
vertices equals m. If elsewise the number of triangles is
bigger than m, we perform removal moves until the trian-

gulation is small enough, and in between diagonal-edge
moves if no removal move is possible. Note that there is a
lower bound on the number of vertices or triangles neces-
sary to triangulate a surface with given genus [35–37], so
it is not possible to create arbitrary small triangulations
for a given g.

III. NUMERICAL COUNTING ALGORITHM

We use the Wang-Landau Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm [23, 24] to numerically measure the density of
states (DOS) g(m), which is up to a normalization factor
the number of triangulations with m triangles. In general
a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm generates sam-
ples ω ∈ Ω from a sample space Ω according to a given
probability distribution P (ω) by creating a Markov chain
of samples with stationary distribution P (ω). Therefor
the transition probabilities P (ω → ω(cid:48)) have to fulﬁll the

detailed balance condition

P (ω1 → ω2)
P (ω2 → ω1)

=

P (ω2)
P (ω1)

.

(2)

A famous and often used example is the Metropolis algo-
rithm [38], where P (ω) ∝ exp[−βE(ω)] is basically the
Boltzmann factor. The Wang-Landau algorithm uses the
probability distribution

PWL(ω) =

1

g(E(ω))

,

(3)

so that the probability distribution in terms of the ener-
gies is ﬂat, and chooses the transition probabilities

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

P (ω1 → ω2) = min

1,

g(E(ω1))
g(E(ω2))

.

(4)

For the considered system of triangulations we use as
energy of a triangulation T its number of triangles m,
so that every number m of triangles is sampled equally
often.

Naturally the DOS is a prior unknown, as in most
physical problems, otherwise the problem of counting the
triangulations would already be solved. So the Wang-
Landau algorithm takes an initial estimation of the DOS
(in our case a ﬂat distribution ginitial ∝ 1) and improves
it gradually by g(m) → f · g(m) whenever a state with
m triangles occurs in the Markov chain. Here f > 1
is a modiﬁcation factor that decreases during the simu-
lation whenever the histogram of visited energies H(m)
recorded at this modiﬁcation factor is approximately ﬂat
to ensure the DOS anneals to the correct DOS. We
use f → f 0.9 as decrease for the modiﬁcation factor,
and consider the histogram of visited energies as ﬂat if
min[H(m)] ≥ c · avg[H(m)] with c = 0.99 at the begin-
ning of the simulation, relaxing this condition to c = 0.8
with decreasing modiﬁcation factor.
(Note that H(E)
is reset after each decrease of the modiﬁcation factor.)
Our ﬁrst modiﬁcation factor is f = exp(1) and decreases

to f = exp(10−8) during the simulation. Our choice of
parameters is way more careful than the original param-
eters proposed in Refs.[23, 24], resulting in a very small
statistical error of our results.

Instead of counting the number Nt(m, g) of triangula-
tions, we calculate the entropy density κc(m, g) deﬁned
by

κc(m, g) := m

−1 log Nt(m, g).

(5)

By using the entropy density we can use directly the out-
put of the Wang-Landau algorithm, which is the logarith-
mic DOS, and cancel the normalization factor. It is also a
common quantity discussed in literature [25, 39, 40] and
corresponds to the value of the (causal) dynamical tri-
angulations’ coupling constant for obtaining scale invari-
ance [1, 2]. In Fig. 3a comparison between our calcula-
tions and results obtained by lexicographic enumeration
for small triangulations [17] shows excellent agreement
and justiﬁes our method.

Due to the diagonal-edge ﬂips being ergodic for large
enough surface triangulations it is suﬃcient to calculate
the density of states in an interval [m−2, m+2] to obtain
the entropy density κc by

κc(m) =

1
8 · log

g(m + 2)
g(m − 2)

,

(6)

using the assumption that κc(m ± 2) ≈ κc(m) valid for
large m. Choosing this small interval of computation, the
calculation speeds up drastically compared to determin-
ing the whole DOS using the Wang-Landau algorithm,
because computation time scales with the number of bins.
In order to fulﬁll the detailed balance condition in the
Wang-Landau algorithm and to correctly calculate the
transition probabilities, one has to compute for each ﬂip
the ratio of selection probabilities of the ﬂip and the in-
verse ﬂip. Assuming that the triangulation has no special

symmetries, the selection probabilities can be determined
in terms of the current simplex numbers and their change
induced by the ﬂip. However, there are symmetric tri-
angulations which make it necessary to check whether
there are other ﬂips leading to an isomorphic triangula-
tion (these ﬂips are then equivalent), the same for the
inverse ﬂip. These isomorphism checks increase drasti-
cally the computation time needed for one step. But
fortunately, as depicted in Fig. 4, the deviations of the
exact (with isomorphisms) calculated and the simpliﬁed
calculations are negligible for triangulations with m > 30.
These results are comparable with these of Ref. [41] on
the level of maps, where it was shown that almost all
maps do not posses intrinsic symmetries, which implies
in our notion that simpliﬁed and exact selection proba-
bility match.

IV. RESULTS

We calculated the entropy density (6) κc(m, g) for ori-
entable and non-orientable surface triangulations up to
genus gmax = 1000 and up to mmax = 107 triangles using
400 independent Wang-Landau simulations.
In Figs. 5
and 6 κc(m, g) is displayed for ﬁxed genus and for ﬁxed
number of triangles.

Inspired by the asymptotic enumeration results for tri-
angulations of the 2-sphere and for maps on arbitrary
surfaces we assume that the number of triangulations be-
haves as

N (m, g) = a(g) · b(g)m · mκ∞

c (g).

This implies for the entropy density (6) the relation

κc(m, g) = a(g) ·

ﬁnd excellent agreement with the theoretical value of

log(
sphere [8]. By inspecting κc(m, g = 1) one ﬁnds that for
g = 1 the entropy density is approximately constant in
terms of m, which implies that b(g) ∝ b1 · (g − 1) without
any constant term, in agreement to [8] and [19], where
b1 = 7/2 for triangulations of the 2-sphere and b1 = 5/2
for triangular maps on surfaces.

To obtain the constants a(g) and b(g) we rescale the

entropy density (8) so that

m · [κc(m, g) − c] = a(g) + b(g) log m.

For every genus g both constants can then be determined
by a linear ﬁt of the rescaled entropy density in terms of
log m. In Fig. 7a the rescaled entropy density is plotted
for orientable surfaces of diﬀerent genera, one can see an
excellent agreement with the proposed linear dependency
in terms of log m for suﬃcient triangles. Using the ﬁtted
constants all obtained data points can be brought to a

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

5

In this paper the number of triangulations of (ori-
entable and non-orientable) surface triangulations with
arbitrary genus was calculated using the Wang-Landau
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Based on our re-
sults, we conjecture the following relation for the asymp-
totic number of surface triangulations

in terms of the type h of the surface, which equals the
genus g for orientable and half its value for non-orientable
triangulations.

These quantitative results for the leading and next-to-
leading order terms can be a valuable hint for mathemati-
cians proving the exact asymptotics of the number of sur-
face triangulations. Additionally, the numerical method
presented in this paper can be directly applied to esti-
mate the number and its asymptotics of special types of
triangulations, e.g. irreducible, k-equivelar or k-covered
triangulations.

Using the presented method makes it possible to
ﬁnd the scaling behavior of triangulations of higher-
dimensional manifolds (either of the total number or
of the number of triangulations with certain proper-
ties), and to conjecture about fundamental questions
that could not be answered until now. For example,
the question whether there are exponentially many or
more triangulations of the d-sphere (or another underly-
ing manifold) in terms of the number of maximal sim-
plices (facets) [42] can only be answered for certain sub-
classes of triangulations (e.g., locally constructable tri-
angulations [43, 44], geometric triangulations [45], tri-
angulations with a Morse function with a ﬁxed number
of critical cells [46], or melonic triangulations, which are
the dominant contribution to the 1/N expansion in group
ﬁeld theory [47]), the answer is there are more than expo-
nentially many in terms of the number of vertices for d-
spheres [48–50]. However, in three and more dimensions
the computational eﬀort increases due to the fact that
for each data point one has to calculate the DOS g(m)
for a much larger interval in the number m of maximal
simplices to ensure ergodicity, since there is no similar
result as in Refs. [33, 34].

Our methods and results can also be used for solv-
ing simplicial quantum gravity models like (causal) dy-
namical triangulations on surfaces with arbitrary genus,
where the leading order term gives the value of the cou-
pling constant necessary for obtaining scale-independent
limits. Furthermore, the next-to-leading order terms can
provide insights into their ﬁnite size scaling, which is im-
portant since these models are solved mainly using Monte
Carlo simulations.

Having ﬁtted a(g) and b(g) for all considered genera
of orientable and non-orientable surfaces, one can access
numerically the scaling relation of both for triangulations
as depicted in Fig. 8. The leading order b(g) = b1· (g− 1)
does diﬀer from the results for triangular maps qualita-
tively, we ﬁnd b1 = −0.197 ± 0.006 for orientable and
b1 = −0.102 ± 0.004 for non-orientable triangulations,
while for triangular maps the theoretical value b1 = 5/2
was found [19]. We conjecture that b1 = −2/5 for ori-
entable and b1 = −1/5 for non-orientable surface trian-
gulations, since these small integer fractions are in the 1σ
bounds of the numerically obtained values. The next-to-
leading order a(g) = (5.14 ± 0.09) · g (orientable) respec-
tively a(g) = (2.60±0.03)·g (non-orientable) has a linear
dependency on g for the considered range of genera (im-
plying a ∝ exp(g) in Eq. (7)), no logarithmic correction
as proposed in [19] for triangular maps is present. For
both a(g) and b(g) one can deduce that the results for ori-
entable and non-orientable triangulations coincide, if one
does not consider the genus, but the type of the surface
(which is half the genus for non-orientable surfaces).
