Coherent interactions at a distance provide a powerful tool for quantum simulation and computa-
tion. The most common approach to realize an eﬀective long-distance coupling ‘on-chip’ is to use a
quantum mediator, as has been demonstrated for superconducting qubits [1, 2] and trapped ions [3].
For quantum dot arrays, which combine a high degree of tunability [4] with extremely long coherence
times [5], the experimental demonstration of coherent spin-spin coupling via an intermediary system
remains an important outstanding goal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
Here, we use a linear triple-quantum-dot array to demonstrate a ﬁrst working example of a coherent
interaction between two distant spins via a quantum mediator. The two outer dots are occupied with
a single electron spin each and the spins experience a superexchange interaction through the empty
middle dot which acts as mediator. Using single-shot spin read-out [23] we measure the coherent time
evolution of the spin states on the outer dots and observe a characteristic dependence of the exchange
frequency as a function of the detuning between the middle and outer dots. This approach may pro-
vide a new route for scaling up spin qubit circuits using quantum dots and aid in the simulation of
materials and molecules with non-nearest neighbour couplings such as MnO [24, 25], high-temperature
superconductors [26, 27] and DNA [28]. The same superexchange concept can also be applied in cold
atom experiments [29].

Nanofabricated quantum dot circuits provide an excellent platform for performing both quantum computation
and simulation using single spins [4, 30, 31, 32]. Many approaches to implementing coherent spin coupling between
distant quantum dots have been proposed using a variety of coupling mechanisms. These include superconducting
resonators [6, 7, 8], surface-acoustic wave resonators [9], ﬂoating metallic [10] or ferromagnetic couplers [11], collective
modes of spin chains [12], superconductors [13, 14], Klein tunneling through the valence or conduction band [15] and
superexchange or sequential operations via intermediate quantum dots [17, 18, 19, 20]. A common theme among
many of these proposals is to create a coupling between distant spins by virtual occupation of a mediator quantum
system. So far, none of these schemes have been performed experimentally. More broadly, there are no experimental
realizations so far of direct quantum gates between any type of solid-state spins at a distance.

In this Letter we focus on the superexchange interaction to induce spin-spin coupling at a distance. Superexchange
is the (usually) antiferromagnetic coupling between two next-to-nearest neighbour spins through virtual occupation
of a non-magnetic intermediate state [24, 25]. To date, only indirect observations of superexchange involving spins
in quantum dots have been reported [33]. Given that superexchange involves a fourth order process in the hopping
amplitude, it is challenging to use it for achieving coherent coupling. This is also the case for several related schemes
relying on quantum mediators.

We use a linear triple-quantum-dot array with one electron on each of the outer dots, and induce a superexchange
interaction through the empty middle dot, which acts as a quantum mediator. This induces spin exchange of the two
distant electron spins. Using repeated single-shot spin measurements we record the coherent time evolution of the spin
states on the outer dots. We control the superexchange amplitude via the detuning of the middle dot electrochem-
ical potential relative to those of the outer dots, and study the cross-over between superexchange and conventional
nearest-neighbour spin exchange.

The dot array is formed electrostatically in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) 85 nm below the surface of a
GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, see Fig. 1a. Gate electrodes fabricated on the surface (see Methods) are biased with

appropriate voltages to selectively deplete regions of the 2DEG and deﬁne the linear array of three quantum dots. The
left and right dot are each occupied with one electron, and each of the two electrons constitutes a single spin- 1
2 particle.
The interdot tunnel couplings are set to ≈ 8.5 GHz (left-middle) and ≈ 11.8 GHz (middle-right). The sensing dot
(SD) next to the quantum dot array is used for non-invasive charge sensing using radiofrequency (RF) reﬂectometry
to monitor the number of electrons in each dot [34]. An in-plane magnetic ﬁeld Bext = 3.2 T is applied to split the
spin-up (↑) and spin-down (↓) states of each electron by the Zeeman energy (EZ ≈ 80 µeV), deﬁning a qubit. The
electron temperature of the right reservoir is ≈ 75 mK.

In this system, superexchange can be seen as the result of the eﬀective tunnel coupling tSE between the outer dots.
The amplitude of superexchange, JSE, is approximated by − t2
 , with  the detuning between the electrochemical
potentials of the outer dots [30], and  = 0 when (1,0,1) and (2,0,0) are degenerate. Here tSE can be described
as tSE = (tm,ltm,r)/δ, with tm,l (tm,r) the tunnel coupling between the middle and the left (right) site and δ the
detuning between the electrochemical potential of (1,1,0) and the average of the electrochemical potentials of (1,0,1)
and (2,0,0) [35]. The superexchange amplitude can thus be approximated as (see Supplementary Information VI for
the range of validity)

which illustrates the characteristic fourth-order hopping process underlying superexchange.

To provide direct evidence of coherent superexchange, we will probe the resulting time evolution of the two spins
via repeated single-shot measurements using spin-to-charge conversion [23]. It is beneﬁcial to perform this conversion
as close as possible to the charge sensor, SD, to achieve high read-out ﬁdelities. In previous work, we therefore shuttled
electrons consecutively from left to middle to right with no detectable sign of spin ﬂips upon shutting [36]. Here, we
explore a diﬀerent approach, transferring the spin from left to right with only virtual occupation of the middle dot,
using the same long-range tunnel coupling that underlies coherent superexchange [33]. We test the two-spin read-out
and long-range spin transfer as described by the schematic diagrams of Fig. 1b and implemented by the pulse sequence
depicted by the blue and red arrows in Fig. 1c. Starting from an empty array, we load a random electron from the
reservoir into the right dot by pulsing into the charge state (0,0,1). Next we pulse into (1,0,0), whereby the electron is
transferred from the rightmost dot to the leftmost dot via a second-order tunnel process across the middle dot. For this
transfer we temporarily pulse δ closer to 0 to increase the long-range shuttling rate (see Supplementary Information
II). Finally, we once more load a random electron in the right dot by pulsing to (1,0,1). We vary the waiting time
in (1,0,1) during which spins relax to the spin ground state |↑ 0 ↑(cid:105). Then we reverse the pulse sequence and add two
calibrated read-out stages denoted by the green circles where spin-to-charge conversion takes place. Fig. 1d shows the
measured decays to the ground state spin-up for each of the two spins. We report read-out ﬁdelities of on average
95.9% and 98.0% for spin-down and spin-up respectively, assuming no spin ﬂips during the spin transfer [36] (see
Supplementary Information IV).

A key signature of superexchange driven spin oscillations is their dependence on the detuning of the intermediate
level (δ), see Eq. (1). We have therefore created linear combinations of the gates P1, P2 and P3 in such a way that we
can independently vary δ and  as can be seen in Fig. 2b. Superexchange occurs in the (1,0,1) charge conﬁguration,
and the superexchange amplitude, JSE, increases for less negative , which translates to an operating point closer to
the (2,0,0)-conﬁguration, see Fig. 2a. Similarly, JSE increases with less negative δ, up to the point where we cross the
(1,0,1)-(1,1,0) transition indicated by the black dashed line in Fig. 2b and spin exchange between nearest-neighbour
dots will dominate (see Fig. 2c). To capture the expected time evolution, we must take into account a diﬀerence in
Zeeman energies between the two dots, ∆Ez = Ez,3 − Ez,1, arising from slight diﬀerences in the g-factor for each
dot [36]. Spin exchange deﬁnes one rotation axis, the Zeeman energy diﬀerence an orthogonal axis, as shown in the
Bloch sphere in Fig. 2d. In the experiment, ∆Ez is ﬁxed, and JSE can be controlled by gate voltage pulses, as we
discussed. By adjusting JSE, we can thus deﬁne the net rotation axis and rate [37]. A similar Bloch sphere can be
made for the nearest-neighbour regime.

The protocol for probing the time evolution is as follows. Starting with an empty array, we create a mixture of
|↑ 0 ↓(cid:105) and |↑ 0 ↑(cid:105) and move to the position of the red star in Fig. 2b, where JSE is small compared to ∆EZ. This
is achieved by sequentially loading the two spins as in Fig. 1c, in this case loading a ↑ in the left dot and a random
spin in the right dot. This procedure allows us to conveniently create an anti-parallel spin state without using more
involved techniques such as electron spin resonance. Next, following the black dashed arrows in Fig. 1c, we pulse
towards the (2,0,0) regime and wait for several ns. The exact location in detuning space is marked in Fig. 2b by a red
diamond. At this point JSE is sizable, |↑ 0 ↓(cid:105) is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian and is thus expected to evolve in
time, periodically developing a |↓ 0 ↑(cid:105) component (|↑ 0 ↑(cid:105) will only acquire an overall phase). The larger JSE/∆EZ,
the larger the |↓ 0 ↑(cid:105) component. We pulse back to the position of the red star in (1,0,1) and follow the same spin
read-out procedure as was done for the T1-measurement in Fig. 1d. Fig. 2e shows the |↑ 0 ↓(cid:105) and |↓ 0 ↑(cid:105) probability as

2

a function of the length of the detuning pulse. We see a sinusoidal dependence, with the |↑ 0 ↓(cid:105) and |↓ 0 ↑(cid:105) populations
evolving in anti-phase, as expected.

Returning to the key signature of superexchange, we ﬁx the value of  and vary δ along the vertical dashed line
shown in Fig. 2b. For each choice of δ, we record the four two-spin probabilities as a function of the length of the
detuning pulse (Fig. 3a). Starting from large negative δ, we ﬁrst observe no oscillations at all: the superexchange
mechanism is suppressed and the |↑ 0 ↓(cid:105)-state remains ﬁxed along the x-axis of the Bloch sphere. As we bring the
electrochemical potential of the intermediate level closer to that of the outer dots, JSE increases in magnitude and slow
oscillations ∼ 150 MHz start appearing that are still dominated by ∆Ez ≈ 130 MHz between the outer dots, hence the
low contrast of the oscillations. The oscillations become faster up to ∼ 900 MHz as δ is increased at which point JSE
is stronger than ∆Ez and the contrast increases. When δ is further increased, the (1,1,0)-state becomes energetically
favourable and the nearest-neighbour exchange between the left and middle dot dominates. Here  = −170 µeV and
this transition occurs around δ = 120 µeV, which is where the black-dashed line in Fig. 2b is crossed. Increasing
δ even more enlarges the detuning between the left and middle dot and thereby slows down the nearest-neighbour
oscillations, as seen in the data.

For a quantitative comparison with the theoretical predictions, we show in Fig. 3b the expected time evolution of
the system modeled using the measured nearest-neighbour tunnel couplings, detunings δ and , and the diﬀerence in
Zeeman energy probed through electric-dipole spin resonance measurements [38]. We include the eﬀect of dephasing
by charge noise [37] via a single parameter to match the decay of the oscillations and account for the known read-out
ﬁdelities (see Supplementary Information V). Fig. 2e shows that it takes more than 1 ns for the superexchange to be
turned on. This is caused by the ﬁnite risetime of the pulses produced by the arbitrary waveform generator and ﬁnite
bandwidth of the coax lines. The simulation includes this gradual turn on and oﬀ of JSE. Comparing Fig. 3a and
Fig. 3b we report good agreement between theory and experiment, which supports our interpretation of the data in
terms of superexchange, including the transition to nearest-neighbour exchange.

In summary, we have demonstrated a ﬁrst working example of a direct quantum gate between solid-state spins
at a distance via virtual occupation of a quantum mediator. This result underlines the utility of arrays of quantum
dots for the investigation and application of fundamental physical processes driven by small-amplitude terms and
higher-order tunneling. It is possible to extend the distance between the coupled spins using elongated intermediate
quantum dots or via diﬀerent (quantum) mediators altogether. Another interesting direction is to create non-nearest
neighbour spin-spin interactions with the centre dot occupied [19, 20], which opens up further new possibilities for
quantum computation and modeling of complex materials.

cross-capacitances. Similarly, M controls mostly the middle dot (see Supplementary Information III). Labels (n, m, p)
indicate the number of electrons in the left, middle and right dot respectively. The middle dot cannot be loaded
directly from a reservoir [39] and the left dot is only weakly tunnel coupled to the left reservoir, leading to faintly
visible charge transitions (black dotted lines indicate their positions). The pulse sequence for loading and read-out
is indicated in the charge stability diagrams via blue and red arrows, see also panel b. The two black dashed arrows

I Methods and materials

The experiment was performed on a GaAs/Al0.25Ga0.75As heterostructure grown by molecular-beam epitaxy, with
a 85-nm-deep 2DEG with an electron density of 2.0 · 1011 cm−2 and mobility of 5.6 · 106 cm2V−1s−1 at 4 K. The
metallic (Ti-Au) surface gates were fabricated using electron-beam lithography. The device was cooled inside an
Oxford Kelvinox 400HA dilution refrigerator to a base temperature of 45 mK. To reduce charge noise, the sample
was cooled while applying a positive voltage on all gates (ranging between 250 and 350 mV) [41]. The main function
of gates LS and RS is to set the tunnel coupling with the left and right reservoir, respectively. D1 and D2 control
the interdot tunnel coupling and P1, P2 and P3 are used to set the electron number in each dot. The device was
tuned to the single-electron regime. Gates P1, P2, P3 and D2 were connected to homebuilt bias-tees (RC= 470 ms),
enabling application of d.c. voltage bias as well as high-frequency voltage excitation to these gates. The microwaves
were generated using a HP83650A connected to P2 via a homemade bias-tee at room temperature. Voltage pulses
to the gates were applied using a Tektronix AWG5014. RF reﬂectometry of the SD was performed using an LC
circuit matching a carrier wave of frequency 111.11 MHz. The inductor is formed from a microfabricated NbTiN
superconducting spiral inductor with an inductance of 3.0 µH. The power of the carrier wave arriving at the sample
was estimated to be -103 dBm. The carrier signal is only unblanked during read-out. The reﬂected signal was ampliﬁed
using a cryogenic Weinreb CITLF2 ampliﬁer and subsequently demodulated using homebuilt electronics. Real time
data acquisition was performed using a FPGA (ﬁeld-programmable gate array DE0-Nano Terasic) programmed to
detect tunnel events using a Schmitt trigger.

II Detailed information of the applied pulse sequence

In this section we give detailed information on the applied pulse sequences. Fig. S1 shows the same charge stability
diagram as Fig. 1c from the main text with additional labeling. Table S 1 gives an explanation including the details of
the relevant stages. To correct for slow variations in the dot levels as a function of time (hours timescale), we always
calibrate the two read-out stages before each longer measurement such as a complete T1 decay (∼ 20,000 datapoints
taken after one calibration run, which takes about half an hour).

A → Stage 1

Stage 1 → C

Purpose and details
Emptying stage (lasting 200 µs) during which all dots are emptied.
Loading an ↑-spin from the right reservoir into the right dot. The electrochemical
potential of the dot is tuned such that only ↑-states will enter the dot. We wait 200 µs
in stage 1.
Shuttle electron from the right to the left dot via a second-order tunnel process across
the middle dot. We temporarily pulse M 30 mV more positive (-382 mV) to increase
the long-range shuttling rate. Waiting time at C is 5 µs. We did not observe any
charge exchange with the reservoir at point C. This is also substantiated by the high
spin-up ﬁdelity: charge exchange results in the loading of random spins and would
therefore increase the oﬀset of the T1-curves.
We pulse M back to the value M = -412. Waiting time at D is 10 µs.
Load a random electron from the right reservoir. Waiting time at E is 100 µs.
Prepare exchange gate. Waiting time at F is 1 µs.
Pulse into exchange position G for a varying time.
Start read-out sequence. Waiting time at F is 1 µs.

C → D

F → Read-out stage 3 Gate voltage pulses larger than ∼2 mV produce a spike in the RF-read-out signal. To
prevent false events, we therefore ﬁrst pulse to a position close to the read-out stage
(2 mV more positive in R) and wait for 2 µs. Only then, the RF-signal is unblanked
and next we pulse into the read-out conﬁguration for 150 µs.

Read-out stage 3 → H Empty the right dot for 50 µs.
H → I

I → Read-out stage 1
Compensation stage

Shuttle electron from the left to the right dot. We temporarily pulse M 30 mV more
positive to increase the long-range shuttling rate. Waiting time at I is 5 µs. Point I is
positioned relatively far away from the interdot transition (1,0,0)-(0,0,1) to circumvent
so-called hot-spots where spin relaxation occurs on the sub-µs timescale [42]. We did
not observe any charge exchange with the reservoir at point I.
Similar as Read-out stage 3.
At the end of the pulse sequence we add a compensation stage of ∼0.5 ms to ensure
that the total DC-component of the pulse is zero. This prevents unwanted oﬀsets of
the dot levels due to the bias tees.

Table S 1: Detailed explanation of the applied pulse sequence as described by Fig. S1. Unless noted otherwise, we
always ramp from one point to the other (ramp time is 1 µs). The total duration of this sequence is around 900 µs,
not including the compensation stage at the end.

III Virtual gates L, M and R

To control the electron number inside each dot we change the voltages on gates P1, P2 and P3. In practice each gate
couples capacitively to all three dots. Changing for example P1 which couples mostly to dot 1, will therefore also
inﬂuence dot 2 and 3. To make selective control of each dot easier it is convenient to correct for this capacitive cross-
coupling. This can be done by measuring the cross-capacitance matrix for the three gates recording the inﬂuence of
each gate on every dot. Inverting this matrix allows us to create charge stability diagrams with vertical and horizontal
charge transitions in a so-called ‘virtual gate’-space. In such a ‘virtual gate’-space, the real gates P1, P2 and P3 have
been replaced by linear combinations of the three gates which allow the user to change the chemical potential in one
dot, without changing the chemical potential in the neighboring dots.

For this experiment the exact relation between P1, P2 and P3 and the ‘virtual gates’ L, M and R used is given by

with P1,oﬀset = 23.99 mV, P2,oﬀset = 61.01 mV, P3,oﬀset = −111.6 mV. This set of virtual gates did not perfectly
correct for cross-capacitances, as the capacitances themselves turn out to slightly vary with the gate voltages. Working
with virtual gates does however give one large freedom to take slices at any angle through the 3D honeycomb diagram
that satisfy the requirements for the experiment.

In this section we describe how we calculated the simulated data as shown in Fig. 3b of the main text.

I Theoretical model

We model our system using the following hamiltonian, deﬁned in the S(200), S(110), T0(110), S(101), T0(101) basis.

The matrix elements are deﬁned as follows:
•  is the detuning between the outer dots
• δ is the detuning of the middle dot with respect to the average of the outer dots
• tl is the tunnel coupling between the S(200) and S(110) state
• tr is the tunnel coupling between the (110) and (101) state
• ∆Ez,21 is the diﬀerence in Zeeman energy between dot 1 and 2, deﬁned as Ez,2 − Ez,1.
• ∆Ez,31 is the diﬀerence in Zeeman energy between dot 1 and 3, deﬁned as Ez,3 − Ez,1.

We have to solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation to incorporate the ﬁnite rise- and falltime of the AWG:

We numerically approximate the time evolution of Ψ(t) by discretizing time in steps ∆t and calculating
Ψ(t + ∆t) = e−iH(t)∆t/

Ψ(t). We model the time dependence of (t) and δ(t) as follows:

i ∂

Ψ(t) = H ((t), δ(t)) Ψ(t)

If t < tf :

Else:

(t) = [(tf ) − (0)] · (1 − e−t/trise) + (0)
δ(t) = [δ(tf ) − δ(0)] · (1 − e−t/trise) + δ(0)

(t) = [(tf ) − (0)] · (1 − e−tf /trise) · e−(t−tf )/trise + (0)

Where F i↑ and F i↓ are the read-out ﬁdelities for dot i (see Table S 2). We denote the measured four two-spin probabilities
at time t by Πmeasured(t) = (P↑↑, P↑↓, P↓↑, P↓↓). The actual two-spin probabilities Π(t), i.e. corrected for the read-out
ﬁdelities, can be found by solving the linear equations Πmeasured(t) = FΠ(t). The linear equations are solved by
numerically minimizing the squared length of the vector Πmeasured(t) − FΠ(t) and restricting the solutions Π(t) to
physical solutions (all elements have to be positive and the sum of the elements has to be one, since the vector consists
of four two-spin probabilities). Using this method we determine Π(t = 0), which is used as initial condition for the
simulation. The outcome of the simulation, Π(t), is multiplied by F to calculate the theoretically expected Πmeasured(t)
as shown in Fig. 3b of the main text.

Input parameters

Zeeman energy Ez: The Zeeman energy in each dot has been measured using electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR)
in a similar way as in Ref. [44]. At 3.2 T the Zeeman energy is 19.380 GHz, 19.528 GHz and 19.510 GHz for dot 1, 2
and 3 respectively.

Tunnel couplings tl and tr: The tunnel coupling at zero detuning between neighbouring dots was measured
using photon-assisted tunneling [45], see Fig. S 5. These measurements were also used to determine the lever arm αi
of each gate for  and δ. tr was measured at: (, δ) = (−230, 180) µeV. This is close to the detuning where the data of
Fig. 3a was acquired. The value of tl had to be measured however for a diﬀerent tuning: (, δ) = (230, 180) µeV. Tunnel
couplings depend strongly on the exact gate voltages. We measured for example that decreasing δ by 300 µeV whilst
staying on the (2,0,0)-(1,1,0) transition decreases tl by ∼30%. At the detuning of the experiment most datapoints
are taken away from the (2,0,0)-(1,1,0) transition in the direction of the (1,1,0)-regime where tl will be even further
reduced [46]. We ﬁnd a good match between experiment and simulation by keeping tr ﬁxed at the measured 11.8 GHz
and lowering the measured tl by 45% to 8.5 GHz. We have veriﬁed that changing tl is the most eﬃcient way to get
good agreement with experiment. tl strongly inﬂuences the oscillations for positive δ, whilst the product of tl and
tr dominates for negative δ. This allowed us to determine that tl had to be changed and not tr. Future work could
incorporate the precise dependence of tunnel coupling on detuning.

(tf ), δ(tf ) and trise : The model described in Eq. (3)-(6) is an approximation to the true shape of the pulse.
The measured output of the AWG including the low pass ﬁlter (MiniCircuits SBLP-300+) can be modeled well with
trise ≈ 0.8 ns. The coax cables inside the dilution refrigerator show a shorter trise (<600 ps), but in addition suﬀer
from the skin eﬀect. Due to this eﬀect it takes several ns to reach the ﬁnal voltage value on the sample. In practice this
means that for short pulses (< few ns) Eq. (3)-(6) work ﬁne if (tf ) and δ(tf ) are reduced in magnitude to incorporate
the skin eﬀect. This is also seen in practice by measuring a pulsed version of charge stability diagram Fig. 2b of the
main text. Fig. 2b depicts the charge stability diagram when changing the detunings relatively slowly (∼ms timescale
per horizontal trace). To verify that the fast (∼ns) pulses arrive at slightly diﬀerent points in detuning-space, we
create a mixture of ↑ 0 ↓ and ↑ 0 ↑ in (1,0,1) and pulse for 5 ns to the same detunings as Fig 2b and detect the
spin-state. This pulse starts at (, δ) ≈ (−950, 0). Fig. S6 shows the expected three regimes: (1) as long as the pulse
stays within the (1,0,1)-region no spin evolution occurs, (2) pulsing into the (2,0,0)-region leads to a mixture of the
↑ 0 ↓, ↓ 0 ↑ and ↑ 0 ↑ states as a consequence of full dephasing during the superexchange and (3) pulsing into (1,1,0)
induces coherent nearest-neighbour exchange. Comparing Fig. S6 and Fig 2b shows that the transition from (1,0,1)
to (2,0,0) takes place at a more positive  as expected: ∼300 µeV. This is attributed to the skin eﬀect inside the coax
cables. A similar measurement for a pulse time of 1 µs does not show this shift. The data in Fig. 3a is taken for
(tf ) = 0. To compensate for the skin eﬀect we need to input a more negative value for  in the simulation to get good
agreement with the data: -170 µeV. To make a perfect model one could ﬁrst measure the precise pulse shape arriving
at the sample more carefully.

Despite some uncertainty in the exact value of some of the input parameters, within a reasonable range of inputs
all give a similar qualitative picture. They all show the change from a regime driven by ∆Ez,31 for negative δ, to
superexchange oscillations that become faster as δ is increased to a regime of nearest-neighbour oscillations that slow
down as δ becomes more positive. This underlines that our experimental data indeed shows the transition from

neighbour exchange

In this section we make a comparison of the charge-noise sensitivity of superexchange versus nearest-neighbour ex-
change. This allows us to compare the quality factor, Q, in the regime where charge noise is the dominant source of
dephasing (i.e. J > ∆EZ). Q is proportional to the number of visible exchange oscillations within the dephasing time:
Q ∝ J · T ∗

We start with an approximation of the nearest-neighbour exchange interaction JN by [47]

with tN the neareast-neighbour tunnel coupling and  the detuning between the dots. This approximation is valid in
the regime where tN (cid:28) || and  < 0. We assume that ﬂuctuations in  are the dominant contribution to dephasing
and neglect dephasing from other ﬂuctuating parameters [43]. The sensitivity to charge noise is then given by

JN ≈ − t2

Note that in this approximation, a larger Q for a ﬁxed J is obtained by increasing the tunnel coupling.

A similar ﬁrst order approximation can be made for the superexchange regime. It however only gives reliable results
for a small portion of the detuning space. To give a fair comparison between nearest-neighbour and superexchange
we therefore used the same model as in section V to numerically calculate J and the eﬀect of charge noise for each
value of δ and . Assuming uncorrelated, equal magnitude noise in δ and  results in the following expression for the
charge-noise sensitivity

and we approximate Q by

For simplicity we set the g-factor diﬀerences to 0 and assume equal nearest-neighbour tunnel couplings t. The calculated
log(Q) for t = 40 µeV is shown in Fig. S7a. White contour lines indicate constant J for several diﬀerent values of J.
From Fig. S7a we can conclude the following if we limit ourselves to the (1,1,0)- and (1,0,1)-regime: for a ﬁxed J, the
best Q is always obtained by operating in the short-range regime (1,1,0). (Please note that all white lines in (1,0,1)
eventually enter the (1,1,0)-regime; for several contour lines this happens outside the plotted detuning range of the
ﬁgure.)

It is possible to boost the performance of both superexchange and nearest-neighbour exchange by increasing the
interdot tunnel coupling. In Fig. S7b and c we plot how much Q and J change respectively when t is doubled to
t = 80 µeV. This shows that the Q and J of superexchange both improve inside the (1,0,1)-region by increasing t,
allowing one to induce more oscillations at higher speed. Inside the nearest-neighbour region (1,1,0) there is also a
large region where both Q and J increase.

We can also include the (2,0,0)-region in the discussion which can be reached using long-range tunneling. This
requires the timing jitter of the tunneling from the (1,0,1)- to the (2,0,0)-region to be small compared to J. This
condition can be satisﬁed by making the tunnel couplings suﬃciently large. In that case, the contour lines in Fig. S7a
indicate that for a ﬁxed J, the Q’s are similar for both the nearest-neighbour and superexchange region. This can
be understood from the fact that in the far detuned regime, the energy splitting between the T0 and S state (J)
is linearly proportional to the detuning and the tunnel coupling has a negligible inﬂuence. We expect the nearest-
neighbour and superexchange to show even better Q’s when operating in the very far detuned regime inside (2,0,0),
where the exchange is set by the orbital splitting and the sensitivity to charge noise is low [43]. In that regime we
expect the nearest-neighbour and superexchange to have the same quality factor.

As a ﬁnal observation we note that nearest-neighbour exchange can never fully be turned oﬀ and can at most be
reduced to t2/U with U the charging energy of the dot [47]. Superexchange can be set closer to zero however as δ can
easily be made larger than U : this is beneﬁcial to fully decouple qubits.

White lines represent contour plots of ﬁxed J for several diﬀerent values of J. Black line denotes the transition between
nearest-neighbour and superexchange. b Change in Q when t is doubled to t = 80 µeV: ∆Q = Q(t = 80)− Q(t = 40).
White line represents contour plot of ∆Q = 0. c Change in J when t is doubled to t = 80 µeV: ∆J = J(t = 80)−J(t =
40). White line represents contour plot of ∆J = 0. The decrease in J in the (2,0,0)-region is caused by the increased
anti-crossing between the T0(1, 1, 0)- and T0(1, 0, 1)-state.
