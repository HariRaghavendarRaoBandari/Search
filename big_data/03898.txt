Abstract—Generalized spatial modulation (GSM) uses N an-
tenna elements but fewer radio frequency (RF) chains (R) at
the transmitter. Spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing are
special cases of GSM with R = 1 and R = N, respectively. In
GSM, apart from conveying information bits through R modu-
lation symbols, information bits are also conveyed through the
indices of the R active transmit antennas. In this paper, we derive
lower and upper bounds on the the capacity of a (N, M, R)-GSM
MIMO system, where M is the number of receive antennas.
Further, we propose a computationally efﬁcient GSM encoding
(i.e., bits-to-signal mapping) method and a message passing based
low-complexity detection algorithm suited for large-scale GSM-
MIMO systems.

Keywords – GSM-MIMO capacity, GSM encoding, combinadics,

low-complexity detection, message passing.

I. INTRODUCTION

Spatial modulation (SM) is emerging as a promising multi-
antenna modulation scheme (see [1] and the references
therein). SM uses multiple antenna elements but only one radio
frequency (RF) chain at the transmitter. The single-RF chain
feature of SM brings in several advantages including reduced
RF hardware complexity, size and cost, no spatial interference,
and simple detection at the receiver, while offering the capacity
and diversity beneﬁts of multi-antenna systems. In SM, only
one antenna element is activated in a given channel use and
a QAM/PSK symbol is sent on the activated antenna; the
remaining antenna elements remain silent. The index of the
active antenna element also conveys information bits. It has
been shown that SM can achieve better performance than
spatial multiplexing (SMP) under certain conditions [1].

Generalized spatial modulation (GSM) is a generalization of
SM, where the transmitter uses multiple (N ) antenna elements
and more than one (R) RF chain [2]. R among the N available
antenna elements are activated in a given channel use, and
R QAM/PSK symbols are sent simultaneously on the active
antennas. The indices of the R active antennas also convey
information bits. Both SM and SMP can be seen as special
cases of GSM with R = 1 and R = N , respectively. It
has been shown that for a given modulation alphabet and N ,
there exists an optimum R ≤ N that maximizes the spectral
efﬁciency [3]. Further, for the same spectral efﬁciency, GSM
can perform better than both SM and SMP [4],[5]. This is
illustrated in Fig. 1 which shows the bit error rate (BER) per-
formance of maximum likelihood (ML) decoding for different
conﬁgurations of MIMO systems each with N = M = 8
and same spectral efﬁciency of 8 bits per channel use (bpcu).

BER performance of different MIMO conﬁgurations with same

We can see that the (8,8,2)-GSM MIMO system outperforms
both the (8,8,1)-system (i.e., SM system) and (8,8,8-system
(i.e., SMP system). This superior performance of GSM-MIMO
motivates us to study its capacity limits. While most studies
on SM/GSM in the literature so far have focused mainly
on performance analysis and receiver algorithms, capacity
of SM/GSM systems remains to be studied. The need for
capacity analysis of SM has also been highlighted in [1].
In [6], the authors have obtained the capacity of SM for
MISO systems through simulation. However, an analytical
characterization of the capacity of SM/GSM has not been
explored. Our contribution in this paper addresses this gap. In
particular, we derive lower and upper bounds on the capacity
of GSM. Another contribution is the proposal of low complex-
ity encoding (i.e., bits-to-GSM signal mapping) and detection
methods suited for GSM-MIMO systems with large number of
antennas and RF chains. The proposed encoding makes use of
combinadic representations in combinatorial number system,
and the detection makes use of layered message passing.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II introduces the GSM-MIMO system model. GSM-MIMO
capacity bounds are derived in Section III. The proposed
combinadics based GSM encoding scheme and the layered
message passing based GSM detection scheme are presented
in Section IV. Conclusions are presented in Section V.

II. GSM-MIMO SYSTEM MODEL

Consider a (N, M, R)-GSM MIMO system with N antennas
and R RF chains at the transmitter (1 ≤ R ≤ N ), and M
antennas at the receiver. Figure 2 shows the GSM transmitter.
An R × N switch connects the R RF chains to the N
transmit antennas. In each channel use, R out of N transmit
antennas are chosen and activated. The remaining N − R
antennas remain silent. The selection of the R antennas to
activate in a channel use is done based solely on ⌊log2(cid:0)N
R(cid:1)⌋
of the active antennas convey ⌊log2(cid:0)N
R(cid:1)⌋ information bits per
channel use. On the active antennas, R modulation symbols
(one on each active antenna) from a modulation alphabet A are
transmitted. This conveys R⌊log2 |A|⌋ additional information
bits. Therefore, the total number of bits conveyed in a channel
use in GSM is given by

information bits (not based on CSIT). Therefore, the indices

Let G denote the GSM signal set, which is the set of
all possible GSM signal vectors that can be transmitted.
Therefore, if x is the N × 1 signal vector transmitted by
the GSM transmitter, then x ∈ G. For example, for N = 4,
R = 2, and BPSK, i.e., A = {±1}, a GSM signal set can be

Let s denote the R×1 vector of modulation symbols that are
to be transmitted in a channel use over the R chosen antennas,
i.e., s ∈ AR.
Deﬁnition: Deﬁne a matrix A of size N ×R as the antenna
activation pattern matrix. The matrix A represents a particular
choice of R antennas from the available N antennas, such that
the N × 1 GSM signal vector x = As ∈ G. The matrix A is a
sparse matrix consisting only of 1’s and 0’s, with exactly one
non-zero entry in every column and one non-zero entry in R
rows. If I1, I2,··· , Ir,··· , IR are the indices of the chosen
antennas, then A is constructed as

Aij = (cid:26) 1 if j = r and i = Ir

0 otherwise,

(2)

where Aij denotes the element in the ith row and jth column
of A.

1A zero in a coordinate in a GSM signal vector means the transmit antenna

corresponding to that coordinate is silent.

Note that
the indices of the non-zero rows in matrix A
give the support of the GSM signal vector x. Out of the
(cid:0)N
R(cid:1) possible antenna activation choices, only 2⌊log2 (N
R)⌋ are
needed for signaling. Let A denote this set of all allowed
R)⌋
antenna activation pattern matrices, where |A| = 2⌊log2 (N
and A ∈ A. Let L , |A|. Now, G is given by

G = (cid:8)x : x = As, for some A ∈ A, s ∈ AR(cid:9).
(4)
Note that any GSM signal vector xj ∈ G, j = 1,··· ,|G|,
can be represented as xj = Aisk with some Ai ∈ A,
i = 1,··· ,|A| and sk ∈ AR, k = 1,··· ,|A|R, and
|G| = |A||A|R. Conversely, given any Ai ∈ A and sk ∈
AR, there exists a GSM signal vector xj ∈ G such that
xj = Aisk. Since Ai and sk are chosen by two independent
information bit sequences, Ai and sk are independent. That is,
p(x) = p(As) = p(A)p(s). Thus, the above system model of
GSM-MIMO decouples the choice of active antennas and the
transmitted modulation symbols into two independent random
variables, namely A and s. This makes the GSM-MIMO
system analysis simpler.

The M × 1 received signal vector y = [y1 y2 ··· yM ]T at

the receiver can be written as

y = Hx + w = HAs + w,

(5)
where x ∈ G is the transmit vector, H ∈ CM×N is the channel
gain matrix whose (i, j)th entry Hi,j ∼ CN (0, 1) denotes the
complex channel gain from the jth transmit antenna to the ith
receive antenna, and w = [w1 w2 ··· wM ]T is the noise vector
whose entries are modeled as complex Gaussian with zero
mean and variance σ2. Since x is obtained based only on ηgsm
information bits, x and H are independent. Since x = As, As
and H are independent. Also, A and s are independent. So, A
and H are independent. So, the mutual information between
x and y in GSM is given by I(x; y|H) = I(A, s; y|H).

III. GSM-MIMO CAPACITY BOUNDS

Hence, the differential entropy h(y) can be lower bounded as

The capacity of a spatially multiplexed M × N MIMO
channel with channel state information at the receiver is [7]

Here, we are interested in the capacity of GSM-MIMO, where

= EH(h(y) − h(y|x)) = EH(h(y) − h(w))
= EH(h(y) − log2[det(πeσ2IM )]),

(8)

where h(.) denotes the differential entropy. To compute
CGSM , we need to evaluate h(y), which requires the knowl-
edge of the distribution of y. From (5), we can see that the
distribution of y is a Gaussian mixture given by

to get a closed-form solution to the above
expression. Hence, we try to bound it above and below by
the following techniques.

Lower bound 1, L1: Since − log(.) is a convex function, by

Jensen’s inequality,

From the above equation, CGSM can be lower bounded as

CGSM ≥ L2 , EH(l2 − log2 det(πeσ2IM )).

(17)

Based on the two lower bounds L1 and L2, a reﬁned lower

bound on GSM-MIMO capacity is given by

CGSM ≥ L , max(L1, L2).

Upper bound 1, U1: By the property of entropy, we can

Further, we also have

E[− log p(y)] ≥ − log E[p(y)].

h(y) = h(y, A) − h(A|y) ≤ h(y, A).

Using the above properties, an upper bound for h(y) can be
written as

Now, an upper bound on CGSM can be written as

(19)

Upper bound 2, U2: Here, we approximate the probability
distribution of y to a Gaussian distribution. This leads to an
upper bound because the entropy of any random variable is
bounded above by the entropy of a Gaussian random variable
with the same mean and variance. The mean and covariance
of y are given by

Comparison of simulated capacity and bounds for GSM-MIMO

Numerical results: We evaluated the lower and upper bounds
on the GSM-MIMO capacity for different system conﬁgura-
tions. Figure 3 shows the lower and upper bounds for GSM-
MIMO systems with N = 16, R = 12, M = 16. We see
that the lower bound L2 and upper bound U2 are tighter at
low SNRs. Whereas, the lower bound L1 and upper bound U1
are tighter at high SNRs. It can be noted from the ﬁgure that
the lower and upper bounds are very close at low SNRs; so,
in this regime, the GSM-MIMO capacity is almost same as
that of a spatially multiplexed MIMO system with the same
N and M . In Fig. 4, we compare the bounds on GSM-MIMO
capacity with the true GSM-MIMO capacity obtained through
simulation. We consider GSM-MIMO with N = 8, M = 1,
SNR = 2, 32 dB, and varying R. In the top ﬁgure of Fig. 4,
we observe that, at SNR = 2 dB, the gap between the upper
and lower bounds is U − L = 0.188 bps/Hz for R = 1 and
U − L < 10−2 bps/Hz for R > 5. Also, in the bottom ﬁgure
of Fig. 4, at SNR = 32 dB, the gap is U − L = 0.782 bps/Hz
for R = 1 and U − L < 10−2 bps/Hz for R > 6.

IV. LOW-COMPLEXITY GSM-MIMO

ENCODING/DECODING

It is known that large-scale MIMO systems provide a variety
of advantages [8]. However, for large values of N, M, R in
GSM-MIMO, the encoding and decoding complexities become
prohibitively large. In this section, we propose low-complexity
methods to encode and detect GSM signals that scale well for
large N, M, R.

A. GSM encoding using combinadics

In GSM-MIMO, ⌊log2(cid:0)N
R(cid:1)⌋ bits are used to choose an
activation pattern matrix A from A, and R⌊log2
A⌋ bits
are used to generate s from AR. While the mapping of
A⌋ bits to modulation symbols in s is straight-forward,
R ⌊log2
the mapping of ⌊log2(cid:0)N
R(cid:1)⌋ bits to a choice of activation pattern
is not. A table or a map of bit sequence to activation patterns
has to be maintained both at the transmitter and receiver. For
large values of N, M, R, the size of this map can become
prohibitively large. For example, if N = 64, R = 32, then
32(cid:1) ≈ 1.83×1018 ≈ 260. Implementation of an encoding
|A| = (cid:0)64
map of this size is impractical. To alleviate this problem,
we use combinadic representations in combinatorial number
system.

Deﬁnition: The combinadic of a number n ∈ [0,(cid:0)N
i=1(cid:0)Ni
the R-tuple (N1, N2,··· , M ) such that n = PR
N1 < N2 < ··· < M < N .

The values of Ni for a given n can be obtained as [9]

The following encoding procedure maps the bits to antenna

1) Accumulate ηa bits to form the bit sequence b =

2) Find the combinadic of g(b).
3) Construct A matrix such that the indices of the R non-

zero rows of A are given by the combinadic of g(b).

An example of the encoding map for N = 4, R = 3 based of
the above procedure is illustrated in Table I. The demapping
procedure is listed below.

1) Obtain the combinadic corresponding to the decoded

antenna activation pattern matrix.

2) Compute g(ˆb) from this combinadic as g(ˆb) =

3) Demap g(ˆb) to get ˆb.

The above low complexity mapping/demapping procedures
allow practical implementation of GSM encoding for large
N, M, R.

Example: Let nt = 10, nrf = 4. Then, |A| = 27 = 128.

Mapping: Let b = [0010011] be the bit sequence that is to be
transmitted. The decimal equivalent of b is d(b) = 19, and
the combinadic of 19 is (N1, N2, N3, N4) = (0, 1, 4, 6). The
corresponding indices of the activated antennas are (1, 2, 5, 7).

sequence for this decimal value of 14 is [0001110]. This gives
the corresponding bit sequence of the detected antenna activity
pattern at the receiver.

B. GSM Detection: Layered message passing algorithm

The maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detection rule

for GSM-MIMO is given by

ˆx = argmax

x∈G

p(x | y).

(23)

Note that, |G| = 2ηgsm. Therefore, the exact computation of
(23) requires exponential complexity in N, R. To address this
problem, here we propose a low complexity layered message
passing (LaMP) algorithm which gives an approximate solu-
tion to (23). In the proposed LaMP algorithm, we deﬁne four
sets of nodes and exchange messages between them in layers.
There are two layers of message exchanges, one corresponds to
the detection of modulation symbols and the other corresponds
to the detection of the antenna activation pattern. In order to
describe this algorithm, we deﬁne a new variable as follows.
is called the antenna activity
indicator if ai = 1 if the ith antenna is active, else ai = 0. That
is, ai = 1{ith antenna is active}, where 1 is the indicator function.
Therefore, xi = ais, s ∈ A. Note that PN
i=1 ai = R,
which we call as the GSM system constraint G. Let a ,
[a1, a2,··· , aN ]. Now, p(x | y) in (23) can be written as

Deﬁnition: A variable ai

p(x, a|y) ∝ p(y|x, a)p(x, a)
= p(y|x)p(x|a)p(a)
= n M
Yi=1
Yj=1

p(yi|x)

N

p(xi|ai)op(a).

(24)

Thus, by deﬁning a new layer of variables ais corresponding
to antenna activity, we have effectively decoupled the depen-
dences present among the elements of the transmit vector x.
Based on (24), we model the GSM-MIMO system as a graph
with four types of nodes, namely,

• M observation nodes corresponding to the elements of

y,

• N variable nodes corresponding to the elements of x,
• N antenna activity nodes corresponding to the elements

of a, and

• a constraint node corresponding to the GSM constraint

G.

This is illustrated in Fig. 5. On this graph, we iteratively
pass messages between the nodes and obtain the marginal
probabilities of the transmitted symbols.

Using the above approximation, we derive the messages as
follows.

The APP of the individual elements of x is given by

Fig. 5. Graphical model and messages passed in the proposed LaMP detector.

The different messages passed in this graph are
1) vji: from observation node yj to variable node xi,
2) pij: from variable node xi to observation node yj,
3) qi: from variable node xi to antenna activity node ai,

and

4) ui: from antenna activity node ai to variable node xi.

The messages are exchanged between two layers, namely,

1) Layer 1: observation nodes and variable nodes (denoted
by unshaded nodes in Fig 5); this layer generates approx-
imate a posteriori probabilities of the individual elements
of x, and

2) Layer 2: antenna activity nodes and GSM constraint
node (denoted by shaded nodes in Fig 5); this layer
generates approximate a posteriori probabilities of the
individual elements of a.

In constructing the messages at the variable nodes, we employ
a Gaussian approximation of the interference as described
below. This signiﬁcantly reduces the detection complexity.
From (5), we can write

yj = Hjixi + gji,

us to relieve the elements of x from the dependencies on the

Message passing: The schedule of the messages passed in

the LaMP algorithm is as follows:

|A∪0| and qi(b) = R

1) Intiliaze pij(x) = 1
2) Compute vji(x), ∀x, i, j.
3) Compute ui(b), ∀b, i.
4) Compute pij (x), ∀x, i, j.
5) Compute qi(b), ∀b, i.
6) Perform damping of messages pji(x) and qi(b) with a

N , ∀x, b, i, j.

damping factor ∆.

This completes one iteration of the LaMP algorithm. These
steps are repeated until a ﬁxed number of iterations are
reached.

Complexity of LaMP: The computational complexities of
evaluating the messages vji(x), pij(x), and qi(b) are of order
O(M N|A|) per iteration of the LaMP algorithm. Because of
the N − 1 convolutions required for each of the N antenna
activity indicators, a naive method of computing ui(b) will
result in a computational complexity of order O(N 3 +N 2). To
reduce this complexity, we propose the following techniques.
1. Deconvolution: In this technique, at every iteration, we

qi, which gives a probability mass func-
ﬁrst compute φ0 =
tion with N + 1 points (0, 1,··· , N ). To evaluate each φi, we
deconvolve qi from φ0, which gives the required probability
mass function with N points. This method has a computational
complexity of order O(N 2 + N ). A disadvantage of this
method is that, in a limited precision system, the deconvolution
operation is not numerically stable. Because of this reason,
deconvolution may some times result in negative values to
probabilities. To avoid this limitation in ﬁxed precision sys-
tems, we can employ one of the following techniques.

2. Using FFT: Since Fourier transform converts convolution
to multiplication in the transformed domain, FFT can be
exploited for reducing the complexity in computing ui(b).
First, we obtain Qi, an N -point FFT of qi,∀i. Then, we
compute φf = ΠN
i=1Qi. Now, to evaluate each φi we compute
IFFT( φf
), which gives the required probability mass function
Qi
with N points. This method has a computational complexity
of order O(N 2 + N ). It is noted that the Fourier transform
preserves only the total power in a signal (a consequence
of Parseval’s theorem) and not the sum of amplitudes, i.e.,

P∀k Qi(k) 6= P∀k qi(k) = 1. Thus, in order to satisfy the

condition of total probability being 1, every φi computation
requires a normalization. This marginally increases the com-
putations required compared to the previous technique.

3. Gaussian approximation: To compute ui(b), we require
N − 1 probability mass functions, i.e., qis. We note that qi is a
Bernoulli distribution with probability masses for ai = 0 and
ai = 1, i.e., Pr(ai = 0|x) = qi(0) and Pr(ai = 1|x) = qi(1).
The evaluation of φi requires the computation of the distri-
al, where the antenna
bution of the random variable

converge when this technique is employed. This is because
the probability masses obtain from the Gaussian distribution
is only an approximation, while the other two techniques give
the exact probability.

Simulation results: For comparison purposes, we simulated
the detection performance of convex superset relaxation (CSR)
based detection in [10] for GSM-MIMO. We have adapted
the CSR algorithm presented for GSSK in [10] to GSM by
modifying one of the CSR’s constraints, namely,PN
i=1 xi = R
to kxk2 ≤ Rγ, where γ is the signal power of the modulation
alphabet.
Figure 6 presents a performance comparison between the
proposed LaMP detection, ML detection, and CSR based
detection for different (N, M, R)- GSM MIMO systems with
BPSK. It can be seen that the LaMP performance is away
from ML performance by about 3 dB and 1.6 dB for (8, 8, 4)-
and (16, 16, 4)-GSM MIMO systems, respectively, at 10−5
BER. Thus, the performance of LaMP improves as the system
dimensions increase. Also, LaMP detection performs better
than the CSR detection in [10] – e.g., by about 1.8 dB at 10−5
BER in (16, 16, 4)-GSM MIMO system. Figure 7 presents a
performance comparison between the LaMP detection, MMSE
detection (performed as [HH H+ 1
SN R I]−1HH y), CSR detec-
tion in [10] for the following large-scale GSM-MIMO system
conﬁgurations: (i) (32, 32, 16)-GSM, 4-QAM, |A| = 229, 61 bpcu,
(ii) (64, 64, 16)-GSM, 4-QAM,
|A| = 248, 80 bpcu, and (iii)
(64, 64, 32)-GSM, 4-QAM, |A| = 260, 124 bpcu. It can be seen
that the proposed LaMP algorithm performs better and its
performance improves as the dimensionality of the GSM signal
increases.

In Fig. 8, we plot the average SNR required by the LaMP
detection algorithm to achieve a target BER of 10−3 as the
number of receive antennas M is varied. We consider two
GSM MIMO systems here, (i) N = 32, R = 16, 4-QAM, 61
bpcu, and (ii) N = 16, R = 8, 4-QAM, 29 bpcu. From Fig.
8, it can be seen that as M increases the SNR required to
achieve the target BER reduces. It can also be observed that
the LaMP detection algorithm performs well even when the
system is underdetermined, i.e., M < N . This is because the
LaMP detection algorithm exploits the sparse structure of the
GSM transmit signals to efﬁciently perform detection.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We studied GSM MIMO capacity and low complexity meth-
ods for GSM encoding and detection. We made the following
key contributions in this paper: 1) we derived lower and upper
bounds on the GSM MIMO capacity, 2) we proposed an
efﬁcient GSM encoding method using combinadics for large
number of transmit antennas and RF chains, and 3) we also
proposed a message passing based low-complexity detection
algorithm suited for large-scale GSM MIMO systems.
