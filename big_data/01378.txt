ABSTRACT

We have analyzed the HCO+ (1–0) data of the Class I–II protostar, HL Tau, obtained
from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array long baseline campaign. We
generated the HCO+ image cube at an angular resolution of ∼0.′′07 (∼10 AU), and
performed azimuthal averaging on the image cube to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio
and measure the radial proﬁle of the HCO+ integrated intensity. Two gaps at radii of
∼28 AU and ∼69 AU and a central cavity are identiﬁed in the radial intensity proﬁle.
The inner HCO+ gap is coincident with the millimeter continuum gap at a radius of
32 AU. The outer HCO+ gap is located at the millimeter continuum bright ring at a
radius of 69 AU and overlaps with the two millimeter continuum gaps at radii of 64
AU and 74 AU. On the contrary, the presence of the central cavity is likely due to the
high optical depth of the 3 mm continuum emission and not the depletion of the HCO+
gas. We derived the HCO+ column density proﬁle from its intensity proﬁle. From
the column density proﬁle, the full-width-half-maximum widths of the inner and outer
HCO+ gaps are both estimated to be ∼14 AU, and their depths are estimated to be
∼2.4 and ∼5.0. These results are consistent with the expectation from the gaps opened
by forming (sub-)Jovian mass planets, while placing tight constraints on the theoretical
models solely incorporating the variation of dust properties and grain sizes.

Introduction

HL Tau is a Class I–II protostellar source located in the northern part of the L1551 region in
the Taurus molecular cloud at a distance of ∼140 pc (Hayashi & Pyo 2009). It is still embedded

in a protostellar envelope with a size of ∼3000 AU and surrounded by a circumstellar disk with a
size of ∼100 AU (Mundy et al. 1996; Wilner et al. 1996; Carrasco-Gonz´alez et al. 2009; Kwon et al.
2011). Previous interferometric observations have found infalling motion in the protostellar envelope
(Hayashi et al. 1993). In addition, jets and bipolar outﬂows launched from this protostellar source
have also been observed at optical and infrared wavelengths and in molecular lines (Monin et al.
1996; Takami et al. 2007; Hayashi & Pyo 2009; Lumbreras & Zapata 2014). The presence of the
infall and the outﬂow implies that HL Tau is still in the active mass accretion phase.

Recent observations of the millimeter and submillimeter continuum emission with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at high angular resolutions of ∼0.′′03–0.′′07, corre-
sponding to a physical size of ∼5–10 AU, discovered a series of ringlike gaps in the disk around HL
Tau (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015; Akiyama et al. 2015). The presence of the gaps suggests the
depletion of material or the variation of dust properties at these radii. It is considered as hints of
forming planets in the disk. Therefore, HL Tau becomes a promising candidate of ongoing planet
formation.

Subsequent theoretical studies to understand the origin of the ringlike structures predict the
presence of multiple, sub-Jovian mass (MJ ) planets in the disk (Dipierro et al. 2015; Kanagawa et al.
2015; Tamayo et al. 2015; Jin et al. 2016). The other studies claim that gravitational instabilities
(Takahashi & Inutsuka 2014), pebble growths (Zhang et al. 2015), or dust aggregates (Okuzumi et al.
2015) can explain the observed features. A direct search for planetary bodies in the gaps in the disk
around HL Tau has been performed with imaging observations in L′ band. No planet was found,
and the observations put the upper limits on the planet mass to be 10–15 MJ (Testi et al. 2015).

However, the information on the gas component, the major mass content in the disk, in these
gaps of the millimeter continuum emission remains unclear. Even though the HCO+ (1–0) emission,
tracing the gas component in the disk around HL Tau, is also detected at standard-of-rest velocities
(VLSR) of 2–12 km s−1 in the ALMA observations, its image was generated at a lower angular
resolution of ∼0.′′25, corresponding to 35 AU, because of the limited signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio
(ALMA Partnership et al. 2015). This HCO+ (1–0) image indeed clearly shows the Keplerian
rotation of the disk (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015; Pinte et al. 2016), but its resolution is too
coarse to identify the counterparts of these continuum gaps in the image. In this letter, we report
the radial intensity proﬁles and reconstructed intensity map of the HCO+ (1–0) emission in the disk
around HL Tau at a high angular resolution of ∼0.′′07, revealing the counterparts of the continuum
gaps in the gas component.

2. Observations

The HL Tau data analyzed here were retrieved from the public data release of the ALMA
Science Veriﬁcation observations (project code: 2011.0.00015.SV). The details of the observations
have been described by ALMA Partnership et al. (2015). We retrieved the 3 mm continuum im-

– 3 –

age directly from the ALMA data archive, while re-generated the HCO+ (1–0; 89.188526 GHz)
and CO (1–0; 115.271202 GHz) image cubes at higher angular resolutions than those presented
by ALMA Partnership et al. (2015). Our HCO+ and CO image cubes were generated by Fourier-
transforming their calibrated visibility data at a velocity resolution of 0.4 km s−1 with the Briggs
robustness parameter of −1 and without tapering, using the tasks in Common Astronomy Soft-
ware Applications (CASA). We did not perform self-calibration on their visibility data because
self-calibration did not improve their S/N ratios, as demonstrated by ALMA Partnership et al.
(2015). Because the CO image cube was used to derive the temperature proﬁle, we did not perform
the continuum subtraction on its visibility data, as explained below, while the HCO+ data were
continuum subtracted using the CASA task uvcontsub. Because there is no clear detection above
S/N ratios of 3 in the image cubes, no “CLEAN” was performed. The angular resolutions of the
HCO+ and CO images are ∼0.′′1 × 0.′′05 and ∼0.′′07 × 0.′′04, respectively, and their noise levels are
∼2 and ∼6 mJy Beam−1 per channel.

3. Results

3.1. HCO+ (1–0) Intensity Proﬁle

Because there is no clear detection at a S/N ratio > 3 in our high-resolution HCO+ image cube,
we performed azimuthal averaging on the image cube to enhance the S/N ratio and to measure
its radial intensity proﬁle. The disk around HL Tau is inclined by 47◦ from the plane of the sky,
and its major axis has a position angle of 138◦ from north to east (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015).
These angles were adopted to correct the projection of the disk on the plane of the sky, and the
de-projected radius of each pixel was computed. The size of each radial bin for azimuthal averaging
was adopted to be the half of the beam size (∼0.′′035 or ∼5 AU). To minimize the confusion from the
foreground or background molecular clouds and the associated outﬂows (ALMA Partnership et al.
2015), only the pixels within ±45◦ of the major axis were included in azimuthal averaging, where
the velocities are blueshifted and redshifted away from the systemic velocity because of the rotation
of the disk. Then we obtained the azimuthally averaged HCO+ spectrum at each radial bin. The
averaged spectra at representative radii are presented in Figure 1. The spectra at several radii
show a negative dip centered at VLSR ∼ 6–7 km s−1, which has also been seen in the spectrum
at the low angular resolution (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015). That can be due to absorption by
foreground clouds or the outﬂow associated with HL Tau. We integrated the spectrum over VLSR
of 2–12 km s−1 to measure the integrated intensity at each radial bin, and the velocity channels
showing absorption (red histograms in Figure 1) and those having values within the ±1σ noise
level were excluded when we measured the integrated intensity. The 1σ noise level of each averaged
spectrum was measured using the line-free channels in that spectrum. The measured radial proﬁle
of the integrated intensity of the HCO+ emission is presented in Figure 2a. The uncertainty of the

integrated intensity at each radial bin was estimated as √Nint × σ × dv, where Nint is the number

of channels integrated, σ is the noise level of the averaged spectrum, and dv is the velocity width

– 4 –

of one channel.

For visualization, we reconstructed the integrated intensity map of the HCO+ emission from its
radial intensity proﬁle, assuming the intensity distribution is axisymmetric. We ﬁrst computed the
de-projected radius of each pixel in the map, and the pixel value was assigned by linear interpolation
between the two closest radial bins of the intensity proﬁle. We note that in the low-resolution
HCO+ image (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015), the distribution of the HCO+ emission is not fully
symmetric, and the emission on the northwestern side is brighter than that on the southeastern
side. Due to the limited S/N ratio in our high-resolution image cube, the asymmetry of the
intensity distribution cannot be further investigated. Nevertheless, the hints of the gaps at ∼30
AU and ∼70 AU are seen on the both sides of the disk when we measured the HCO+ intensity
proﬁle. The reconstructed integrated intensity map of the HCO+ emission is presented in Figure
3 in comparison with the 3 mm continuum image of the HL Tau disk, which is obtained with
the same ALMA observations and has a comparable angular resolution (ALMA Partnership et al.
2015). Our HCO+ intensity map clearly shows two gaps and a cavity at the center.

In our HCO+ results, there is no counterpart of the innermost gap at a radius of ∼13 AU
and the central emission peak seen in the 3 mm continuum image (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015;
Instead, the HCO+ intensity map displays a ∼10 AU wide cavity at the
Akiyama et al. 2015).
center. Likely, this is at least partially related to the high optical depth of the 3 mm dust continuum
emission toward the center. The continuum-subtracted spectral-line image is essentially biased
by features which are anti-correlated with the intensity distribution of the continuum emission.
Because of the increasing continuum intensity toward the center, we are expecting to see the
following eﬀects on the continuum-subtracted HCO+ data, (1) absorption features at the peak
of the continuum emission, (2) a suppressed contrast between the rings and gaps in the HCO+
intensity, and (3) a ﬂattening in the HCO+ intensity proﬁle towards the continuum peak (Figure
2a). Indeed, the derived radial proﬁle of the HCO+ column density, as shown below, is steeper than
its intensity proﬁle (Figure 2), although the overall HCO+ column density proﬁle remains biased
by the not as well constrained radial temperature proﬁles of the dust and the gas.

3.2. HCO+ Column Density Proﬁle

To estimate the column density of the HCO+ gas, we assume that the dust grains and the gas
are thermally well coupled and have the same temperature, and that the HCO+ gas is thermalized
for simplicity. The temperature proﬁle (T ) is adopted to be the radial proﬁle of the brightness
temperature of the CO emission without continuum subtraction, on the assumption that the CO +
3 mm continuum emission is optically thick and traces the temperature structure of the disk. The
radial proﬁles of the CO brightness temperature without continuum subtraction was measured with
the same method as that for the HCO+ intensity proﬁle, and is shown in Figure 4b. Because the
bright continuum emission can bias the continuum-subtracted line intensity, we ﬁrst estimated the
radial proﬁle of the optical depth of the 3 mm continuum emission (τ3mm) from its radial intensity

– 5 –

proﬁle and the temperature proﬁle using the radiative transfer equation,

Tb,3mm = (T − Tbg) · (1 − e−τ3mm ),

(1)

where Tb,3mm is the brightness temperature of the 3 mm continuum emission and Tbg is the tem-
perature of the cosmic microwave background radiation (∼2.73 K). The derived radial proﬁle of the
optical depth of the 3 mm continuum emission is shown in Figure 4a, and its 1σ uncertainty was
estimated by propagating the uncertainties in T and Tb,3mm through Equation 1. The continuum-
subtracted brightness temperature of the HCO+ emission (Tb,HCO+) can be described as

Tb,HCO+ = Tb,89GHz − Tb,3mm,

(2)

where Tb,89GHz is the brightness temperature at the frequency of the HCO+ line before the contin-
uum subtraction, and

Tb,89GHz = (T − Tbg) · (1 − e−τtot),

(3)

where τtot is the total optical depth contributed by the 3 mm continuum and the HCO+ line
(τHCO+), i.e., τtot = τ3mm + τHCO+. Therefore, we corrected the eﬀect of the continuum optical
depth on the observed HCO+ brightness temperature as

Tb,HCO+ = (T − Tbg) · e−τ3mm · (1 − e−τHCO+ ),

(4)

and estimated τHCO+ at each radial bin. T and Tb,HCO+ were adopted to be the mean brightness
temperature of the azimuthally-averaged CO and HCO+ spectra within VLSR of 2–12 km s−1. Then,
following the derivation in Mangum & Shirley (2015), we estimated the HCO+ column density as

2.2 × 107 · T ·

1 − e−4.28/T

1 − e−τHCO+ Z τHCO+dv cm−2.

(5)

The derived proﬁle of the HCO+ column density is presented in Figure 2c, and its 1σ uncertainty
was estimated by propagating the uncertainties in Tb,HCO+, T , and τ3mm through Equation 4 and
5. The column density proﬁle presented here has radial bins with a size of ∼0.′′035 (∼5 AU), which
is the half of the beam size, and is azimuthally averaged over ±45◦ of the major axis.

We note that the mm-sized dust grains, which are located closer to the mid-plane, can have
a lower temperature than the gas located closer to the disk surface. If that is the case, the dust
temperature is lower than the measured T , and then τ3mm is underestimated. The derived HCO+
column density becomes higher. In addition, the absorption in the HCO+ spectra (Figure 1) is
expected to be more signiﬁcant at the radii of the continuum bright rings than the continuum gaps,
and hence, the HCO+ column density at the radii of the bright rings can be underestimated more
than that at the gaps. These eﬀects can lead to larger depths of the HCO+ gaps than the values
estimated in this work.

3.3. HCO+ Gaps

The overall column density proﬁle cannot be well represented by a single power-law function
(Fig. 2c). Therefore, we treated the inner and outer HCO+ gaps separately to derive their widths
and depths. For each gap, we ﬁrst ﬁtted a power-law function to the column densities only at
the radial bins near the gap (red dashed and dotted lines in Figure 2c) to interpolate the column
densities within the gap. The ﬁtted power-law function was subtracted from the column density
proﬁle at those radial bins including the gap. Then we ﬁtted each gap in the residual with a Gaussian
function, and derived the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of each gap and a column density at
the center of each gap. The contrast in the column density inside and outside the gaps is estimated
by comparing the column density at the center of the gaps and that of the ﬁtted power-law function
at the same radius (Figure 2c). We repeated this ﬁtting process for a 10,000 times, where each
time the radii and densities of the data points are randomly changed within the radial bins and
the 1σ uncertainties, respectively. With this we obtained the probability distributions of the ﬁtting
parameters, and the 10,000 iterations is suﬃcient to converge. Then we ﬁtted Gaussian functions
to these probability distributions, and the centers and standard deviations of the ﬁtted Gaussian
functions were adopted as the best-ﬁt values and the 1σ uncertainties. With these processes, the
HCO+ column density in the inner and outer gaps are estimated to be ∼(5±1) × 1015 cm−2 and
∼(1.4±0.4) × 1015 cm−2. Both HCO+ gaps have similar FWHM widths of ∼14±7 AU. Assuming
the HCO+ abundance does not vary across the gaps, the contrast between the gas density inside
and outside the gaps is a factor of ∼2.4±0.5 and ∼5.0±1.2. The detailed ﬁtting results are listed
in Table 1.

4. Discussion

The locations of two HCO+ gaps are compared with those of the gaps and bright rings in the
milimmeter continuum images (Figure 2). The inner HCO+ gap is coincident with the continuum
gap at a radius of 32.3 AU (D2 gap; ALMA Partnership et al. (2015)). On the other hand, the outer
HCO+ gap is located at the bright continuum ring at a radius of 68.8 AU (B5 ring), and overlaps
with the two continuum gaps at 64.2 AU and 73.7 AU (D5 and D6 gaps; ALMA Partnership et al.
(2015)). Our results indicate that the material, including both dust and gas, are depleted at the
D2, D5, and D6 gaps. By comparing with the gap depths estimated from the continuum data
(Kanagawa et al. 2015; Pinte et al. 2016), the gas gaps are comparable to or shallower than the
dust gaps.

Hydrodynamical simulations and analytical frameworks have suggested that these gaps can be
opened due to tidal interactions with sub-Jovian or Saturn mass planets (Kanagawa et al. 2015;
Dong et al. 2015; Dipierro et al. 2015; Picogna & Kley 2015; Jin et al. 2016).
If these gaps are
indeed opened by planets, our estimated gas temperature and the derived depths of the HCO+ gaps
lead to planet masses of ∼0.8 MJ at ∼28 AU and ∼2.1 MJ at ∼69 AU, following the gap formula

– 7 –

(Kanagawa et al. 2015) and assuming the viscosity α of 0.001. These values are larger than those
published in the previous works based on the depths of the dust gaps and the dust temperature
estimated from the continuum emission (Kanagawa et al. 2015; Dong et al. 2015; Dipierro et al.
2015; Jin et al. 2016). Gap opening by a planet is currently still unknown for a disk with a vertical
temperature gradient (Lee & Gu (2015) and references therein). The gap formula and all the
simulations simply assume vertically isothermal disks, but observations suggest cold dust near the
disk mid-plane and hot gas above it (Kwon et al. 2011). Nonetheless, sub-Jovian planetary masses
can be obtained when the lower temperatures from these works are adopted in our estimation.

Besides the gap depths, the noticeable oﬀset between the D5 and D6 gaps and the outer HCO+
gap may also evidence the presence of a planet. The B5 ring and the outer HCO+ gap are almost
located at the same radius, implying the presence of mm-sized dust at this radius. The coincidence
of the HCO+ gap and B5 ring is explained if the B5 ring corresponds to the horseshoe region of
the putative planet (Dipierro et al. 2015; Picogna & Kley 2015). Hence, the D5 and D6 gaps are
oﬀset from the horseshoe region, rather than aligning with the center of the outer HCO+ gap. In
addition, our estimated gas temperature and HCO+ column density may hint at a pressure bump
at the outer edge of the outer HCO+ gap, which situates around the bright continuum ring at a
radius of ∼81.3 AU (B6 ring; ALMA Partnership et al. (2015)). Such a pressure bump is normally
associated with the outer edge of a planetary gap. In contrast, the relative position between the
inner HCO+ gaps and the D2 gap is less clear due to the limited S/N ratio and the uncertainties
in deriving the HCO+ column density.

Alternatively, the origin of the outer HCO+ gap can be related to the CO snow line without
the presence of a planet. Although at a radius of &60 AU, the temperature estimated from our CO
image cube is ∼60 K (Fig. 4), much higher than the CO sublimation temperature (∼20 K), the
CO depletion may still occur at the mid-plane, where the temperature can be as low as 20 K, as
estimated from the millimeter continuum emission (Kwon et al. 2011; Pinte et al. 2016). CO is a
parent molecule of HCO+, so its depletion can result in the depletion of HCO+. With the depletion
considered, we are expecting to see that the HCO+ column density decreases more rapidly beyond
the CO snow line without forming a gap. Nevertheless, theoretical models suggest that gas can
pile up around the snow line due to the transition in the strength of magneto-rotational instability,
leading to a density bump (Kretke & Lin 2007). With ALMA observations, changes in density and
properties of dust around the CO snow line have been seen in the protoplanetary disk around HD
163296 (Guidi et al. 2016). With the combination of these two eﬀects, the HCO+ depletion and
the density bump around the snow line, there is a possibility to form a gap in the HCO+ column
density proﬁle. Similar mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of the continuum
gaps in the disk around HL Tau (e.g., Zhang et al. (2015)). However, to examine this scenario,
detailed theoretical calculations on the required degrees of the HCO+ depletion and the density
bump to reproduce the observed outer HCO+ gap are needed. On the contrary, the temperature
at the radius of the inner HCO+ gap is most likely much higher than 20 K even at the mid-plane,
as estimated from the millimeter continuum emission (Kwon et al. 2011; Pinte et al. 2016). Thus,

– 8 –

this scenario is less possible to interpret the presence of the inner HCO+ gap.

There are also other possibilities to create both gas and dust gaps in the disk around HL Tau in
the absence of multiple planets, such as the variation of dust properties and dust sizes via dust-to-
gas feedback (e.g., Takahashi & Inutsuka (2014); Gonzalez et al. (2015)). Our observations suggest
that the total width of the D5 and D6 gaps (23.2 AU; Pinte et al. (2016)) are approximately
twice wider than that of the outer HCO+ gap, while the D2 gap has a comparable width (11.0
AU; Pinte et al. (2016)) to the inner HCO+ gap. These hint at diﬀerent gas-dust coupling along
the disk radius (Paardekooper & Mellema 2004; Fouchet et al. 2007). Therefore, more detailed
predications of locations, widths, and depths of dust and gas gaps from these models taking account
of radial variation of gas-dust coupling is needed to examine these possibilities.
If planet-disk
tidal interactions are indeed happening, the inferred epoch of formation of gas giant planets will
occur much earlier than the predictions of the standard core accretion model (Pollack et al. 1996),
therefore calling for modiﬁed/alternative formation scenarios (Piso et al. 2015; Helled et al. 2014;
Chabrier et al. 2014).

Fig. 1.— Azimuthally-averaged spectra of the HCO+ (1–0) emission in the disk around HL Tau
observed with ALMA. The central radius of the radial bin of the each spectrum is labeled above
each panel. (a), (c), and (e) present the spectra in the central cavity and the two gaps. (b), (d),
and (f) present the spectra in the bright regions near the gaps. Vertical and horizontal dashed lines
denote the zero intensity and the systemic velocity of HL Tau (VLSR of 7 km s−1), respectively. Two
horizontal dotted lines denote ±1σ noise levels of the individual spectra. Red histograms present
the channels which show absorption and were excluded when we measured the integrated intensity.

Fig. 2.— (a) Radial proﬁle of the HCO+ integrated intensity in the disk around HL Tau observed
with ALMA. Vertical blue solid and dashed lines denote the radii of the bright rings and the gaps
identiﬁed in the 1 mm continuum image observed with ALMA at an angular resolution of 0.′′03
(corresponding to ∼5 AU; ALMA Partnership et al. (2015)). (b) Radial proﬁle of the S/N ratios
of the HCO+ integrated intensity. (c) Radial proﬁle of the HCO+ column density derived from the
intensity proﬁle. Red dashed and dotted lines present the ﬁtted power-law density proﬁles outside
the inner and outer gaps, respectively, and red solid lines delineate the observed gaps. The centers,
widths, and depths of the gaps are listed in Table 1. Error bars in panels (a) and (c) correspond
to the 1σ uncertainties.
