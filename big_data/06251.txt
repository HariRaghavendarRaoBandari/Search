Lax Distributive Laws for Topology, I

Dedicated to the memory of Bob Walters

Abstract

For a quantaloid Q, considered as a bicategory, Walters introduced categories enriched in Q. Here
we extend the study of monad-quantale-enriched categories of the past ﬁfteen years by introducing
monad-quantaloid-enriched categories. We do so by making lax distributive laws of a monad T
over the discrete presheaf monad of the small quantaloid Q the primary data of the theory, rather
than the lax monad extensions of T to the category of Q-relations that they equivalently describe.
The central piece of the paper establishes a Galois correspondence between such lax distributive
laws and lax Eilenberg-Moore T-algebra structures on the set of discrete presheaves over the
object set of Q. We give a precise comparison of these structures with the more restrictive notion
introduced by Hofmann in the case of a commutative quantale, called natural topological theories
here, and describe the lax monad extensions introduced by him as minimal. Throughout the
paper, a variety of old and new examples of ordered, metric and topological structures illustrate
the theory developed, which includes the consideration of algebraic functors and change-of-base
functors in full generality.

Keywords: quantaloid, quantale, monad, discrete presheaf monad, lax distributive law, lax
λ-algebra, lax monad extension, monad-quantaloid-enriched category, topological theory, natural

1. Introduction

For monads S and T on a category C, liftings of S along the forgetful functor C T

/ C of the
/CS to the Kleisli
Eilenberg-Moore category of T, or extensions of T along the insertion functor C
category of S, correspond precisely to Beck’s [4] distributive laws λ : T S
/ ST of T over S; see
[3] and II.3 of [26] for a compact account of these correspondences. For C = Set, T = L the free
monoid (or list) monad, and S the free Abelian group monad, their algebraic prototype interpretes
the left-hand terms of the equations

x(y + z) = xy + xz

and

(x + y)z = xz + yz

as elements of the free monoid LSX over (the underlying set of) the free Abelian group SX over
some alphabet X and assigns to them the right-hand terms in SLX, to then obtain the category
of (unital) rings as the Eilenberg-Moore algebras of a composite monad SL as facilitated by λ.
Similarly, keeping T = L but letting now S = P be the power set monad, the distributive law

λX : LPX

/ PLX,

(A1, ..., An) 7→ A1 × ... × An,

produces a composite monad whose Eilenberg-Moore category is the category of quantales, i.e., of
the monoid objects in the monoidal-closed category Sup of sup-lattices (see [30, 44]), characterized

as the complete lattices with a monoid structure whose multiplication distributes over arbitrary
suprema in each variable. Ever since the appearance of Beck’s original work, distributive laws
have been, and continue to be, studied from a predominantly algebraic perspective, at many levels
of generality; see, for example, [51, 32, 21, 6]. But what is their role in topology, if any?

As a uniﬁcation of the settings used by Lawvere [36] and by Manes [39] and Barr [2] for their
respective descriptiens of metric spaces and topological spaces, the viewpoint of Monoidal Topology
[12, 15, 14, 47, 24, 26] has been that some key categories of analysis and topology are described as
categories of lax (T, V)-algebras, also called (T, V)-categories, where V is a quantale and T a Set-
monad with a lax extension to the category V-Rel of sets and V-valued relations (or matrices [5]) as
morphisms. For example, for V = 2 the two-element chain and for T = U the ultraﬁlter monad with
its lax Barr extension to relations, one obtains the Manes-Barr presentation of topological spaces
in terms of ultraﬁlter convergence (with just two axioms that generalize reﬂexivity and transitivity
of ordered sets). With the same monad, but now with V = [0, ∞] being Lawvere’s extended real
half-line and addition playing the role of the tensor product, one obtains Lowen’s [37] category
of approach spaces, which incorporates both Barr’s Top and Lawvere’s Met in a satisfactory
manner. Perhaps one of the best successes of the subject so far has been the strictly equational
characterization of exponential objects in the lax setting of (T, V)-categories. For the extensive
literature on the subject, we must refer the reader to the literature list in [26], in particular the
Notes to Chapters III and IV of [26], which also list many important related approaches, such as
that of Burroni [10] (which drew Lambek’s [35] multicategories into the setting) and the thesis
of M¨obus [42] (which, beyond compactness and Hausdorﬀ separation, explored a wide range of
topological concepts in the relational monadic setting).

For the general (T, V)-setting, it had been realized early on that V-Rel is precisely the Kleisli
category of the V-power set monad PV (with PVX = VX ), and it was therefore plausible that lax
extensions ˆT of T to V-Rel correspond to monotone lax distributive laws of T over PV (see [46] and
Exercise III.1.I of [26]). Our initial point in this paper is to underline the role of lax distributive
laws as the primary data in the study of topological categories, rather than as some secondary
data derived from lax monad extensions, the establishment of which can be tedious (see [12, 47]).
In fact, in analyzing step by step the correspondence between the two entities (as we will do in
Section 6 of this paper), we see that lax distributive laws minimize the number of variables in, and
often the computational eﬀort for, checking the required inequalities. It is therefore consequential
that here we express (T, V)-categories directly as lax λ-algebras, without prior reference to the lax
monad extension which the ambient lax distributive law λ corresponds to. Thus, their axioms are
entirely expressed in terms of maps, rather than V-relations, and of the two Set-monads at play, T
and PV. We note that, to date, the strict counterpart of the notion of lax λ-algebra as introduced
in Section 4 does not seem to have been explored yet – and may be of much lesser importance
than the lax version –, but must in any case not be confused with a diﬀerent notion appearing in
IV.3 of Manes’ book [40].

In fact, in this paper we present the lax distributive laws and their equivalent lax monad exten-
sions, together with their isomorphic model categories (i.e., lax λ-algebras vs. (T, V)-categories)
at a considerably generalized level, by replacing the quantale V by a small quantaloid Q, i.e., by
a small category (rather than a monoid) enriched in the category Sup of complete lattices and
their suprema preserving maps (see [45, 53, 54, 23]). For this to work, T must now be a monad on
the comma category Set/Q0, with Q0 the set of objects of Q, rather than just on Set as in the
quantale case when Q0 ∼= 1 is a singleton set. However, noting that every Set-monad T lifts to a
Set/Q0-monad when Q0 carries a Eilenberg-Moore T-algebra structure, one realizes immediately
that the range of applications is not at all reduced by moving to the comma category. The oppo-
site is true, even when T is the identity monad and λ the identity transformation of the discrete
presheaf monad PQ, where lax λ-algebras are simply Q-categories, as ﬁrst considered in Walters’

we add a monad to the enrichment through quantaloids, thus complementing the corresponding
past eﬀorts for quantales and monoidal-closed categories, and leaving the ﬁeld open for future
work on closed bicategories. In doing so, our focus is not on generalization per se, but rather
on the expansion of the range of meaningful examples.
In fact, through the consideration of
quantaloids that arise from quantales via the well-studied Freyd-Grandis “diagonal construction”,
originating with [18], presented in [20], and used by many authors (see, for example, [28, 43, 55]), we
demonstrate that the quantaloidic context allows for the incorporation of many “partially deﬁned”
structures, which typically relax the reﬂexivity condition of the total context in a meaningful way.
In [24], Hofmann gave the notion of a (lax) topological theory which, in the presence of the Set-
monad T and the commutative quantale V, concentrates all needed information about the speciﬁc
Barr-type lax extension of T to V-Rel into a (lax) T-algebra structure ξ : T V
/ V on the set V,
such that ξ makes the monoid operations ⊗ : V × V
/ V lax T-homomorphisms
and satisﬁes a monotonicity and naturality condition. While in [16] we characterized the Barr-
Hofmann lax extensions of T arising from such theories among all lax extensions, the two main
results of this paper clarify the role of Hofmann’s notion in the quantale setting and extend it
considerably to the more general context of a quantaloid Q. First, in Section 5 we establish a
Galois correspondence between monotone lax distributive laws of a given monad T on Set/Q0
and certain lax T-algebra structures ξ on PQQ0. The lax distributive laws closed under this
correspondence, called maximal, give rise to new types of lax monad extension that don’t seem to
have been explored earlier. Secondly, in Theorem 8.2, we give a precise comparison of our notion
of topological theory (as given in Deﬁnition 5.4) with Hofmann’s more restrictive notion. We also
give a context in which the Hofmann-type extensions are characterized as minimal (see Theorem
8.5). Let us emphasize that the conditions on the cartesian binary and nullary monoid operations
used by Hofmann don’t compare easily with the conditions on the multiplication and unit of the
discrete presheaf monad as used in our setting, and they don’t seem to be amenable to direct
extension from the context of a commutative quantale to that of a quantaloid. For an overview
chart on the relationships between lax distributive laws, lax monad extensions, and topological
theories, we refer to Section 8.

/ V and k : 1

A brief outlook on the forthcoming paper [34] seems to be in order, where we present the non-
discrete counterpart of the theory presented here, thus considering monads on the category Q-Cat
of small Q-categories and their lax distributive laws over the (full) presheaf monad. It is clear
from the outset, and largely veriﬁed by the existing works on monad-quantale-enriched categories,
that this setting will make for a more satisfactory theory, simply because the full presheaf monad,
unlike its discrete counterpart, is lax idempotent (or of Kock-Z¨oberlein type). Nevertheless, the
prior consideration of the discrete case in this paper seems to be a necessary step, in order for us
to be able to provide a viable array of monads on Q-Cat since, with a lax extension of a monad
on Set/Q0 at hand, it is easy to “lift” monads on Set/Q0 to Q-Cat (as has been done in [57] in
the case of a quantale).

For general categorical background, we refer the reader to [38, 1, 7, 31].

2. Quantaloid-enriched categories

A quantaloid is a category Q enriched in the monoidal-closed category Sup [30] of complete
lattices with suprema-preserving maps; hence, the hom-sets of Q are complete lattices, and compo-
sition of morphisms from either side preserves arbitrary suprema and has therefore right adjoints.
As a consequence, one has binary operations ց and ւ representing the “internal homs”, that is:
/ t
for u : r
given by the equivalences

/t in Q one has the morphisms (v ց w) : r

/s, (w ւ u) : s

/t, w : r

/s, v : s

u ≤ v ց w ⇐⇒ v ◦ u ≤ w ⇐⇒ v ≤ w ւ u.

A lax homomorphism ϕ : Q /
/R of quantaloids is a lax functor (thus satisfying the rules 1ϕt ≤ ϕ1t
and ϕv ◦ ϕu ≤ ϕ(v ◦ u)) which maps hom-sets monotonely; ϕ is a (strict) homomorphism if ϕ is a
functor preserving suprema taken in the hom-sets. We denote the category of small quantaloids
and their (lax) homomorphisms by Qnd (LaxQnd). The set-of-objects functor

(−)0 : LaxQnd

/ Set, Q 7→ obQ =: Q0

has a right adjoint (−)c which provides each set X with the chaotic order and considers it as a
category Xc with (Xc)0 = X, so that for all x, y ∈ X there is exactly one morphism x
/ y,
denoted by (x, y); having singleton hom-sets only, Xc is trivially a quantaloid, and every Set-map
becomes a homomorphism.

Throughout the paper, let Q be a small quantaloid. A small Q-category is a set X provided
/ Q0 assigns to every x ∈ X its
with a lax homomorphism a : Xc
array (also called type or extent) ax ∈ Q0, often denoted by |x| = |x|X = ax, and its morphism
part gives for all x, y ∈ X Q-morphisms a(x, y) : |x|

/ Q. Its object part a : X

/ |y|, subject to the rules

1|x| ≤ a(x, x),

a(y, z) ◦ a(x, y) ≤ a(x, z).

/ Y with a(x, y) ≤ b(f x, f y)
A Q-functor f : (X, a)
for all x, y ∈ X. In other words then, the resulting category Q-Cat of small Q-categories and
their Q-functors is the lax comma category of small chaotic quantaloids over Q, and one has the
set-of-objects functor

/ (Y, b) is an array-preserving map f : X

to the comma category of sets over Q0. In what follows, we will often write X instead of Xc or
(X, a).

An easily proved (see [48]), but useful, fact is:

Proposition 2.1. The functor (−)0 is topological (in the sense of [22]) and, as a consequence,
Q-Cat is totally complete and totally cocomplete (in the sense of [52]).

Proof. The (−)0-initial structure a on X with respect to a family of (Set/Q0)-morphisms fi :

with x, y ∈ X.

Incidentally, it seems ﬁtting to note here that topologicity of a faithful functor is characterized
as total cocompleteness when the concrete category in question is considered as a category enriched
over a certain quantaloid: see [19, 49].

Next, one easily sees that every lax homomorphism ϕ : Q

/ R of quantaloids induces the

change-of-base functor

Bϕ : Q-Cat

/ R-Cat, (X, a) 7→ (X, ϕa),

which commutes with the underlying Set-functors. More precisely, with Bϕ0 denoting the eﬀect
of Bϕ on the underlying sets over Q0, one has the commutative diagram of functors which exhibits
(Bϕ, Bϕ0) as a morphism of topological functors:

Q-Cat
Q-Cat

(−)0

Set/Q0
Set/Q0

Bϕ

Bϕ0

R-Cat
/ R-Cat

(−)0

Set/R0
Set/R0

Obviously, Bϕ preserves (−)0-initiality when ϕ preserves inﬁma. Let us also mention that, if we
order the hom-sets of LaxQnd by

ϕ ≤ ψ ⇐⇒ ∀u : r

/ s in Q : ϕr = ψr, ϕs = ψs and ϕu ≤ ψu,

then ϕ ≤ ψ gives a natural transformation Bϕ
identity maps; thus a 2-functor B(−) : LaxQnd

/ Bψ whose components at the Set-level are
/ CAT emerges.

The one-object quantaloids are the (unital) quantales, i.e., the complete lattices V that come
with a monoid structure whose binary operation ⊗ preserves suprema in each variable. We gen-
erally denote the ⊗-neutral element by k; so, in quantaloidic terms, k = 1∗, when we denote by ∗
the only object of V as a category. Let us record here a well-known list of relevant quantales V
with their induced categories V-Cat.

Example 2.2.

(1) The terminal quantaloid 1 is a quantale, and 1-Cat = Set. The initial
quantale is (as a lattice) the two-elemt chain 2 = {⊥< ⊤}, with ⊗ = ∧, k = ⊤, and 2-Cat
is the category Ord of preordered sets and monotone maps. (In what follows, we suppress
the preﬁx “pre” in “preorder”, adding “separated” whenever antisymmetry is required.)

(2) [0, ∞] denotes the extended real line, ordered by the natural ≥ (so that 0 becomes the
largest and ∞ the least element) and considered as a quantale with the binary operation +,
naturally extended to ∞. (This is the monoidal-closed category ﬁrst considered by Lawvere
[36].) A [0, ∞]-category is a generalized metric space, i.e., a set X provided with a function
a : X × X
/ [0, ∞] with a(x, x) = 0 and a(x, z) ≤ a(x, y) + a(y, z) for all x, y, z ∈ X; [0, ∞]-
functors are non-expanding maps. We write Met = [0, ∞]-Cat for the resulting category.
/ [0, ∞] of quantales has both a left and a right adjoint, hence
The only homomorphism 2
there is an embedding Ord
/ Met that is both reﬂective and coreﬂective.

(3) The quantale [0, ∞] is of course isomorphic to the unit interval [0, 1], naturally ordered by
≤ and provided with the multiplication. Interpreting a(x, y) ∈ [0, 1] as the probability that
x, y ∈ X be related under a given random order ˜a on X, we call (X, a) ∈ [0, 1]-Cat a
probabilistic ordered set and denote the resulting cateory by ProbOrd, which, of course, is
just an isomorphic guise of Met.

Both, [0, ∞] and [0, 1] are embeddable into the quantale ∆ of all distance distribution func-
tions ϕ : [0, ∞]
/[0, 1], required to satisfy the left-continuity condition ϕ(β) = supα<βϕ(α),
for all β ∈ [0, 1]. Its order is inherited from [0, 1], and its monoid structure is given by the
commutative convolution product (ϕ ⊗ ψ)(γ) = supα+β≤γϕ(α)ψ(β); the ⊗-neutral function
κ satisﬁes κ(0) = 0 and κ(α) = 1 for all α > 0. Interpreting a(x, y)(α) as the probability
/ [0, ∞] satsisﬁes ˜a(x, y) < α, one calls the
that a given randomized metric ˜a : X × X

objects (X, a) in ∆-Cat probabilistic metric spaces [25, 29], and we denote their category by
ProbMet.
The quantale homomorphisms σ : [0, ∞]
/ ∆, deﬁned by σ(α)(γ) =
0 if γ ≤ α, and 1 otherwise, and τ (u)(γ) = u if γ > 0, and 0 otherwise, induce full em-
beddings of Met and ProbOrd into ProbMet, respectively. Their signiﬁcance lies in
the fact that they present ∆ as a coproduct of [0, ∞] and [0, 1] in the category of com-
mutative quantales and their homomorphisms, since every ϕ ∈ ∆ has a presentation ϕ =
supγ∈[0,∞]σ(γ) ⊗ τ (ϕ(γ)).

/ ∆ and τ : [0, 1]

(4) The powerset 2M of a (multiplicative) monoid M (with neutral element eM ) becomes a
quantale when ordered by inclusion and provided with the composition B ◦ A = {βα | α, β ∈
M } for A, B ⊆ M ; in fact, it is the free quantale over the monoid M . The objects of 2M -
Cat are sets X equipped with a family (≤α)α∈M of relations on them satisfying the rules
x ≤eM x and (x ≤α y, y ≤β z ⇒ x ≤βα z); morphisms must preserve each relation of the
family; see [26] V.1.4. Every homomorphism ϕ : M /
/ N of monoids may be considered a
/ 2N of quantales via direct image, while its right adjoint given by
homomorphism ϕ : 2M
inverse image is in general only a lax homomorphism ϕ−1 : 2N
/ 2M . Still, 2-functoriality
/ 2M -Cat. In particular, when
of (−)-Cat produces adjunctions ϕ(−) ⊣ ϕ−1(−) : 2N -Cat
/ 1 with 1 trivial, one sees that there is a coreﬂective embedding of
considering 1
Ord into 2M -Cat, as well as a reﬂective one.

/ M /

(5) Every frame, i.e., every complete lattice in which binary inﬁma distribute over arbitrary
suprema, may be considered a quantale; in fact, these are precisely the commutative quan-
tales in which every element is idempotent. For example, in addition to 2 of (1), ([0, ∞], ≥)
may be considered a quantale [0, ∞]max when, instead of α + β as in (2), the binary oper-
ation is given by max{α, β}. The resulting category [0, ∞]max-Cat is the category UMet
of generalized ultrametric spaces (X, a) whose distance function must satisfy a(x, z) ≤
max{a(x, y), a(y, z)} instead of the weaker triangle inequality.

A quantale V is called divisible [27] if for all u ≤ v in V there are a, b ∈ V with a⊗ v = u = v ⊗ b;
it is easy to see that then one may choose a = v ց d and b = d ւ u. Applying the deﬁning
property to u = k and v = ⊤ the top element, so that ⊤ = ⊤ ⊗ k = ⊤ ⊗ ⊤ ⊗ a ≤ ⊤ ⊗ a = k, one
sees that such a quantale must be integral, i.e., k = ⊤. Of the quantales of Example 2.2, all but
2M are divisible; 2M is not even integral, unless the monoid M is trivial.

We refer to [18, 20] for the the Freyd-Grandis construction of freely adjoining a proper orthog-
onal factorization system to a category. In the case of a quantaloid Q it produces the quantaloid
DQ of “diagonals” of Q (so named in [55], after the prior treatments in [28, 43]), which has a
particulary easy description when the quantaloid is a divisible quantale V: the objects of the
/ v in DV if d ∈ V
quantaloid DV are the elements of V, and there is a morphism (u, d, v) : u
satisﬁes d ≤ u ∧ v; for ease of notation, we write d : u
v, keeping in mind that it is essential to
keep track of the domain u and the codomain v. The composite e ◦ d of d w:ith e : v
o w in DV
is deﬁned by e ⊗ (v ց d) = (e ւ v) ⊗ d in V, and v : v
v serves as the identity morphism on v
in DV. The order of the hom-sets of DV is inherited from V.

The quantale V is fully embedded into DV by the homomorphism ι = ιV : V

/ DV, v 7→
k), of quantaloids. There are lax homomorphisms, known as the forward and backward

(v : k
globalization functors (see [17, 43, 56]),

δ : DV

/ V,

γ : DV

/ V,

(d : u

v) 7→ v ց d

(d : u

v) 7→ d ւ u

which, from a factorization perspective, play the role of the domain and codomain functors. They
satisfy διV = 1V = γιV and therefore make V a retract of DV. Consequently, the full embedding
V-Cat

/ DV-Cat induced by ι has retractions, facilitated by δ and γ (see Example 7.5).

More importantly, when one considers V as a V-category (V,h) with h(u, v) = v ւ u, there is

a full reﬂective embedding

which provides a DV-category (X, a) with the V-category structure d deﬁned by d(x, y) = a(x, y) ւ
a(x, x) and considers it a V-category over V via tx = a(x, x). Conversely, the reﬂector provides
/ V, with the DV-category
a V-category (X, d) that comes equipped with a V-functor t : X
structure a, deﬁned by a(x, y) = d(x, y) ⊗ tx; see [34].

The quantaloids DV induced by the divisible quantales V of Example 2.2 are of interest in what

follows. Here we mention only a couple of easy cases.

(1) The quantaloid D2 has objects ⊥, ⊤, and there are exactly two morphisms
Example 2.3.
o ⊤ while all other hom-sets are trivial, each of them containing only ⊥. The
⊥, ⊤ : ⊤
object part of a D2-category structure on a set X is given by its ﬁbre over ⊤, i.e., by a
subset A ⊆ X and an order on A; in other words, by a truly partial (!) order on X. A
/ Y with f −1B = A whose restriction to
D2-functor f : (X, A)
/ (Y, B) is a map f : X
A is monotone. We write ParOrd for D2-Cat.

(2) For a D([0, ∞])-category (X, a) one must have (in the natural order ≤ of [0, ∞]) |x| ≤
a(x, x) ≤ |x| for all x ∈ X, so that the object part of the structure a : X × X
/ [0, ∞] is
determined by its morphism part. Since α◦β = (α ւ ν)+β = α−ν +β for ν ≤ α, β ∈ [0, ∞],
the deﬁning conditions on a may now be stated as

a(x, x) ≤ a(x, y) and a(x, z) ≤ a(x, y) − a(y, y) + a(y, z) for all x, y, z ∈ X.

With D([0, ∞])-functors f : (X, a)

/ (Y, b) required to satisfy

b(f (x), f (y)) ≤ a(x, y) and b(f (x), f (x)) = a(x, x) for all x, y ∈ X

one obtains the category ParMet of partial metric spaces, as originally considered in [9].
(For example, when one thinks of a(x, y) as of the cost of transporting goods from location
x to location y, which will entail some ﬁxed overhead costs a(x, x) and a(y, y) at these
locations, the term −a(y, y) in the “partial triangle inequality” justiﬁes itsself since the
operator should not pay twice the overhead at the intermediate location y.) For V = [0, ∞],
the full embedding EV in fact gives an isomorphism

ParMet ∼= Met/[0, ∞]

of categories; i.e., partial metric spaces and their non-expanding maps may equivalently
/ [0, ∞] satisfying
be considered as metric spaces (X, d) that come with a “norm” t : X
ty − tx ≤ d(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X, the morphisms of which are norm-preserving and non-
expanding. The presentation of ParMet as a comma category makes it easy to relate it
properly to Met, as we may look at the forgetful functor Σ : Met/[0, ∞]
/ Met and its
right adjoint X 7→ (π2 : X × [0, ∞]
/ [0, ∞]) (with the direct product taken in Met). When
expressed in terms of partial metrics, Σ is equivalently described by

Bγ : ParMet

/ Met, (X, a) 7→ (X, ˜a), ˜a(x, y) = a(x, y) − a(x, x),

and its right adjoint assigns to (X, d) ∈ Met the set X × [0, ∞] provided with the partial
metric d+, deﬁned by

d+((x, α), (y, β)) = d(x, y) + max{α, β}

for all x, y ∈ X, α, β ∈ [0, ∞].

3. Encoding a quantaloid by its discrete presheaf monad

For a quantaloid Q one forms the category Q-Rel of Q-relations, as follows:

those of Set/Q0, i.e., sets X that come with an array (or type) map a = aX : X

its objects are

ϕ(x, y) : |x|X

/ |y|Y (x ∈ X, y ∈ Y ) in Q; its composite with ψ : Y

Y in Q-Rel is given by a family of morphisms

7 Z is deﬁned by

(ψ ◦ ϕ)(x, z) = _y∈Y

ψ(y, z) ◦ ϕ(x, y).

A map f over Q0 may be seen as a Q-relation via its Q-graph or its Q-cograph, as facilitated by
the functors

For X in Set/Q0 and s ∈ Q0, a Q-presheaf σ on X with array |σ| = s is a Q-relation σ :
{s} (where {s} is considered as a set over Q0 via the inclusion map); hence, σ is a family
X
/ s)x∈X of Q-morphisms with speciﬁed common domain. Assigning to X the set
(σx : |x|
PX = PQX of Q-presheaves on X deﬁnes the object part of a left adjoint to (the opposite of)
the Q-cograph functor, with the morphism part and the correspondence under the adjunction

One notes that Q-Rel is a (large) quantaloid that inherits the pointwise order of its hom-
sets from Q. The full embedding Q
/ Q-Rel, which interprets every s ∈ Q0 as the set {s}
over Q0, is therefore a homomorphism of quantaloids.
Its image serves as a generating set in
Q-Rel. Under the category equivalence Set/Q0 ≃ SetQ0 the set PX over Q0 corresponds to
(Q-Rel(X, {s}))s∈Q0, which lives in SupQ0 . The corresponding order on PX is described by

σ ≤ σ′ ⇐⇒ |σ| = |σ′| and ∀x ∈ X (σx ≤ σ′

x).

For f : X

suprema as well and is easily described in Set/Q0 by

the adjunction f! ⊣ f ! follows from f◦ ⊣ f ◦ in Q-Rel and the monotonicity of (-)⊙ on hom-sets,
which we explain next.

The sets Set(Y, PX) with their pointwise order inherited from PX make the bijections

Q-Rel(X, Y )

/ Set/Q0(Y, PX), ϕ 7→ −→ϕ ,

order isomorphisms. Since

(for ψ : Y

7 Z), monotonicity of (ψ 7→ ψ ◦ ϕ) in ψ makes the maps

Set/Q0(Z, PY )

/ Set/Q0(Z, PX), g 7→ ϕ⊙ · g,

monotone. This proves item (1) of the following Lemma.

Lemma 3.1. For ϕ, ϕ′ : X
Set/Q0 one has:

Y in Q-Rel and f : X

/ Y, g, g′ : Z

/ PY, h : W

/ Z in

(1) ϕ ≤ ϕ′, g ≤ g′ ⇒ ϕ⊙ · g · h ≤ ϕ′⊙ · g′ · h;

(2) yX ≤ f ! · yY · f, f ! · sY = sX · (f !)!.

Proof. The inequality of (2) follows from the naturality of y and the adjunction f! ⊣ f !. For the
stated equality, using

ϕ⊙ = sX · (−→ϕ )!

we can show more generally

ϕ⊙ · sY = sX · (−→ϕ )! · sY = sX · sPX · (−→ϕ )!! = sX · (sX )! · (−→ϕ )!! = sX · (ϕ⊙)!.

Let us ﬁnally mention that, of course, there is a functorial dependency of PQ on the quantaloid
/ R be a lax homomorphism of quantales,
/ Set/R0 be the induced “discrete change-of-base functor” (as in Section

Q, which we may describe brieﬂy, as follows. Let ϑ : Q /
and let Bϑ0 : Set/Q0
2). We can then regard ϑ as a lax natural transformation

so that

ϑ : Bϑ0 PQ

(Bϑ0f )! · ϑX ≤ ϑY · Bϑ0(f!)

for all f : X

/ Y in Set/Q0; indeed, for X ∈ Set/Q0, one deﬁnes ϑX : Bϑ0 PQX

/ PRBϑ0X by

In fact, ϑ is now a lax monad morphism, as described by the following two diagrams:

σ = (σx)x∈X 7→ ϑσ = (ϑ(σx))x∈X .

4. Monads laxly distributing over the presheaf monad, and their lax algebras

Let T = (T, m, e) be a monad on Set/Q0. We wish to generate certain lax extensions of T
to Q-Rel, i.e., to the (dual of the) Kleisli category of the presheaf monad PQ. Since, as is well

Each of these laws is said to hold strictly (at f or X) if the respective inequality sign may be re-
placed by an equality sign; for a strict distributive law, all lax laws must hold strictly everywhere.

The lax distributive law λ is called monotone if

f ≤ g ⇒ λX · T f ≤ λX · T g

/ PX in Set/Q0. For simplicity, in what follows, we refer to a monotone lax
for all f, g : Y
distributive law λ : T P
/T P just as a monotone distributive law, which indirectly emphasizes the
fact that the ambient 2-cell structure is given by order; we also say that T distributes monotonely
over PQ by λ in this case, adding strictly when λ is strict.

Example 4.1.

(1) For every quantaloid Q, the identity monad on Set/Q0 distributes strictly

and monotonely over PQ, via the identity transformation 1P.

(2) For every quantale V, the list-monad L on Set, i.e., the free-monoid monad with underlying

Set-functor LX = Sn≥0 X n, distributes strictly and monotonely over PV, via

⊗X : LPVX

/ PVLX, (σ1, ..., σn) 7→ σ with σ(x1,...,xm) = (cid:26) σ1

For V = 2, so that P2 ∼= P is the (covariant) power set functor, we in particular obtain the
strict monotone distributive law

×X : LP X

/ P LX, (A1, ..., An) 7→ A1 × ... × An,

that was mentioned in the Introduction.

(3) For every quantale V, the Set-monad L may be extended to Set/V: using the monoid
structure of V, one maps every (X, a) ∈ Set/V to (LX, ζ · La), with ζ : LV
/ V the monoid
homomorphism with ζ(v) = v, i.e., ζ : (v1, ..., vn) 7→ v1 ⊗ ...⊗ vn. For the quantaloid Q = DV
(as described in Section 2 when V is divisible) and L considered as a Set/V-monad, one now
obtains a strict monotone distributive law ⊗ : LPQ
/ PQL deﬁned just as in (2), with the
understanding that σ = ⊗X (σ1, ..., σn) is now given by Q-arrows

σ(x1,...,xm) : |x1| ⊗ ... ⊗ |xm|

|σ| = |σ1| ⊗ ... ⊗ |σn|.

(4) (See [33].) For every quantale V = (V, ⊗, k), the power set monad P = P2 of Set distributes
/ PVP which, when we write PVX = VX as the set

monotonely over PV by the law δ : PPV
of maps X

/ V, is deﬁned by

δX : P(VX )

/ VPX ,

(δX F )(A) = ^x∈A _σ∈F

σ(x),

for all F ⊆ VX , A ⊆ X.

(5) Let U = (U, Σ,

˙(-)) denote the ultraﬁlter monad on Set; so, U assigns to a set X the set
of ultraﬁlters on X, the unit assigns to a point in X its principal ultraﬁlter on X, and the
monad multiplication is given by the so-called Kowalsky sum; see [39, 2, 26]. For every
commutative and completely distributive quantale V (see [59, 26]), one deﬁnes a monotone
distributive law β : U PV

/ PVU by

βX : U (VX )

/ VUX ,

(βX z)(x) = ^A∈x,C∈z _x∈A,σ∈C

σ(x),

for all ultraﬁlters z on VX , x on X; compare with Corollary IV.2.4.5 of [26].

Returning to the general context of a quantaloid Q and a monad T on Set/Q0, we deﬁne:

Example 4.3.

(1) For T the identity monad on Set/Q0 and λ = 1PQ, there is an isomorphism
(λ, Q)-Alg ∼= Q-Cat that commutes with the forgetful functors to Set/Q0. Indeed, a lax
7 X, such that
homomorphism a : Xc
p = −→a : X
/ PX satisﬁes the lax unit- and multiplication laws (f) and (g), and conversely;
similarly for the morphisms of the two categories.

/ Q of quantaloids constitutes a Q-relation a : X

(2) In Section 6 we will elaborate on the correspondence between monotone distributive laws λ
of T over PQ and lax extensions ˆT of the monad T to Q-Rel. The λ-algebra axioms for a
T X. In
structure p : T X
the case of Q being a commutative quantale V,

/ PQX may then be expressed in terms of a Q-relation X

(λ, V)-Alg ∼= (T, V)-Cat

becomes the familiar category of (T, V)-categories (X, a : T X
see Remark 6.7 below), satisfying the lax-algebra conditions conditions

7 X) (as deﬁned in [26], but

k ≤ a(eX (x), x) and a(y, z) ⊗ ˆT a(X, y) ≤ a(mX (X), z)

for all z ∈ X, y ∈ T X, X ∈ T T X; morphisms, i.e., (T, V)-functors f : (X, a)
/ (Y, b),
satisfy a(x, x′) ≤ b(f x, f x′) for all x, x′ ∈ X. For example, in the case of Example 4.1(2),
with T = L and V = 2, one obtains the category MulOrd of multiordered sets X (carrying
7 X). For V = [0, ∞] one obtains the category
a reﬂexive and transitive relation LX
MulMet of multimetric spaces (X, a : LX × X
/ [0, ∞]), deﬁned to satisfy the conditions

a((x), x) = 0,
a((x1,1, . . . , x1,n1

morphisms f : (X, a)

(3) (See [33].) For any quantale V and the monotone distributive law δ of Example 4.1(4) that

makes the powerset monad P = P2 distribute over PV,

(δ, V)-Alg = V-Cls

/VX ) which in particular (when V is integral),
is the category of V-closure spaces (X, c : PX /
at every “level” u ∈ V, gives rise to the “c-closure” A(u) = {x ∈ X | c(A)(x) ≥ u} of A ⊆ X.
Considering now the full reﬂective subcategory of V-Cls of those spaces (X, c) for which c
is a homomorphism of join-semilattices, so that the ﬁnite additivity conditions

c(∅) = ⊥ and c(A ∪ B) = c(A) ∨ c(B)

for all A, B ⊆ X are satisﬁed, one obtains for V = 2, [0, ∞], or ∆, respectively topological
spaces (as described by a closure operation), approach spaces (as described by a point-set
distance function [37]), or probabilistic approach spaces [8]; in general, we call them V-
approach spaces. Since lax δ-homomorphisms provide the “right” morphisms in each of the
three cases, we denote the resulting category by V-App and obtain in the special cases the
categories

2-App = Top,

[0, ∞]-App = App, ∆-App = ProbApp.

(4) As shown in [33], for a commutative and completely distributive quantale V and the mono-

tone distributive law β of Example 4.1(5) that makes U distribute over PV,

(β, V)-Alg ∼= V-App

is the category of V-approach spaces; see also Example 7.3. Considering for V the quantales
2, [0, ∞], and ∆, in this way one obtains respectively the ultraﬁlter characterization of the
objects of the categories Top of topological spaces ([2, 26]), App of approach spaces ([37,
12, 26]), and ProbApp of probabilistic approach spaces ([8, 60, 25, 29]).

In generalization of Proposition 2.1 one easily proves:

Proposition 4.4. (λ, Q)-Alg is topological over Set/Q0 and, hence, totally complete and totally
cocomplete.

Proof. For any family of λ-algebras (Yi, qi) and Set/Q0-maps fi : X
X obtains its initial structure p with respect to the forgetful functor (λ, Q)-Alg

/ Yi (i ∈ I), the ﬁxed set

/ Set/Q0 as

p := ^i∈I

(fi)! · qi · T fi

which, in pointwise terms, reads as (px)x = Vi∈I (qi(T fi(x)))fi x, for all x ∈ X, x ∈ T X.

5. Topological theories and maximal lax distributive laws

In addition to the given small quantaloid Q, in this section we restrict ourselves to considering
monads T on Set/Q0 that are liftings of Set-monads along the forgetful Σ : Set/Q0
/ Set. The
following Proposition (which remains valid when Set is replaced by an arbitrary category) states
that these are completely described by Eilenberg-Moore algebra structures on Q0, just as we have
encountered them in the special case of the list monad in Example 4.1(3).

Proposition 5.1. Let T = (T, m, e) be a monad on Set. Then there is a bijective correspondence
between T-algebra structures ζ : T Q0

/ Q0 and monads T′ = (T ′, m′, e′) on Set/Q0 with

ΣT ′ = T Σ, Σe′ = eΣ, Σm′ = mΣ.

Proof. For a “Σ-lifting” T′ of T, let ζ be the array function of the Set/Q0-object T ′(Q0, 1Q0 ),
whose domain must necessarily be T Q0. For any Set/Q0-object (X, a), the unique Set/Q0-
morphism a : (X, a)

/ (Q0, 1Q0) to the terminal object is being mapped by T ′ to

(T X, aT X)

T a

/ (T Q0, ζ), so that aT X = ζ · T a (∗).

The object assignment by T ′ is therefore uniquely determined by ζ, and so is its morphism as-
signment, by faithfulness of Σ. Furthermore, since necessarily

e′
(X,a) = eX : (X, a)

/ (T X, ζ · T a) and m′

(X,a) = mX : (T T X, ζ · T ζ · T T a)

/ (T X, ζ · T a),

in Set/Q0, one has ζ · T a · eX = aX and ζ · T a · mX = ζ · T ζ · T T a which, for X = Q0 and a = 1Q0 ,
amount to the T-algebra laws ζ · eQ0 = 1Q0 and ζ · mQ0 = ζ · T ζ.

Conversely, with T ′ deﬁned by (∗), these laws similarly give the lifting T′ of T along Σ.

In what follows, we will not distinguish notationally between T′ and T. So, we are working
/ Q0 on Q0 that allows
/ PT

with a Set-monad T = (T, m, e) and a ﬁxed T-algebra structure ζ : T Q0
us to treat T as a monad on Set/Q0. For such T and a monotone distributive law λ : T P
we consider the Set/Q0-maps

ξ := (T PQ0

λQ0

/ PT Q0

ζ!

/ PQ0) and θ := (T PPQ0

λPQ0

/ PT PQ0

ξ!

/ PPQ0).

Proposition 5.2. ξ and θ are lax T-algebra structures on PQ0 and PPQ0, respectively, making
yQ0 : (Q0, ζ)
/ (PQ0, ξ) lax T-homomorphisms, that is, producing
the following laxly commuting diagrams:

Moreover, ξ (θ) is a strict T-algebra structure on PQ0 (PPQ0) if λ satisﬁes the lax T-unit and
-multiplication laws (d) and (e) strictly at Q0 (at PQ0, respectively); and yQ0 (sQ0 ) is a strict T-
homomorphism if λ satisﬁes the lax PQ-unit law (b) (the lax PQ-multiplication law (c), respectively)
strictly at Q0.

Proof. Lax unit law for ξ: By (d), ξ · ePQ0 ≥ ζ! · (eQ0 )! = (ζ · eQ0 )! = 1PQ0 , with equality holding
when λ satisﬁes (d) strictly at Q0. Lax multiplication law for ξ: By (e),

ξ · mPQ0 ≥ ζ! · (mQ0 )! · λT Q0 · T λQ0 = ζ! · (T ζ)! · λT Q0 · T λQ0 = ζ! · λQ0 · T (ζ!) · T λQ0 = ξ · T ξ,

with equality holding when λ satisﬁes (e) strictly at Q0.

One proceeds similarly for the (lax) unit and multiplication laws for θ.
Lax homomorphism law for yQ0 : By (b), ξ · T yQ0 ≥ ζ! · yT Q0 = yQ0 · ζ, with equality holding

when λ satisﬁes (b) strictly at Q0. Lax homomorphism law for sQ0 : By (c),

ξ · T sQ0 ≥ ζ! · sT Q0 · (λQ0 )! · λPQ0 = sQ0 · ζ!! · (λQ0 )! · λPQ0 = sQ0 · ξ! · λPQ0 = sQ0 · T yQ0,

with equality holding when λ satisﬁes (c) strictly at Q0.

Remark 5.3.

(1) Let t := |-|PQ0 denote the array map of PQ0 (that assigns to a Q0-indexed
family of Q-morphisms in PQ0 their common codomain). Then |-|T PQ0 = ζ · T t (see (∗) of
Proposition 5.1), and since ξ is a map over Q0, we must have t · ξ = ζ · T t. In other words,
t : (PQ0, ξ)

/ (Q0, ζ) is a strict T-homomorphism.

(2) From ξ = ζ! · λQ0 one obtains λQ0 ≤ ζ! · ξ by adjunction, and the lax naturality (a) of λ at

t then gives

λPQ0 ≤ (T t)! · λQ0 · T (t!) ≤ (T t)! · ζ! · ξ · T (t!).

Consequently, one obtains an upper bound for θ:

θ = ξ! · λPQ0 ≤ ξ! · (T t)! · ζ! · ξ · T (t!).

We now embark on a converse path, by establishing a monotone distributive law from a given

map ξ, in addition to ζ, and by choosing θ maximally.

Deﬁnition 5.4. Let T be a Set-monad that comes with a T-algebra structure ζ on the object set
Q0 of the small quantaloid Q. A topological theory for T and Q is a Set-map ξ : T PQ0
/ PQ0
satisfying the following conditions:

0. t · ξ = ζ · T t
1. 1PQ0 ≤ ξ · ePQ0 , ξ · T ξ ≤ ξ · mPQ0
2. yQ0 · ζ ≤ ξ · T yQ0 , sQ0 · θ ≤ ξ · T sQ0 (with θ = ξ! · (ζ · T t)! · ξ · T (t!))
3. ∀f, g : Y

/ PQ0 in Set/Q0 (f ≤ g ⇒ ξ · T f ≤ ξ · T g)

(with t as in Remark 5(1))

(array compatibility);
(lax T-algebra laws);
(lax T-homom. laws);
(monotonicity).

The theory is strict if the inequality signs in conditions 1 and 2 may be replaced by equality signs.

Proposition 5.2 produces for every (strict) monotone distributive law a (strict) topological

theory. We will call this theory induced by the given law.

Theorem 5.5. For T, Q, ζ as in Deﬁnition 5.4 and a topological theory ξ,

λξ
X := (ζ · T a)! · ξ · T (a!)

for all X = (X, a) ∈ Set/Q0 deﬁnes a monotone distributive law λξ for T and Q. This law is
largest amongst all laws that induce the given theory ξ.

Proof. We check monotonicity of λ = λξ and each of the conditions (a)-(e), considering f :
/ (Y, b) in Set/Q0. Note that c := ζ · T a is the array function of T X. With t the array
(X, a)
function of PQ0 (see Remark (1)), an easy inspection shows that s := t · a! is the array function
of PX.

Monotonicity: For g, h : Y

7 PX in Set/Q0, monotonicity of ξ gives

λX · T g = c! · ξ · T (a! · g) ≤ c! · ξ · T (a! · h) = λX · T h.

(a) With the adjunction (T f )! ⊣ (T f )!, from b · f = a one obtains (T f )! · (T a)! ≤ (T b)!. Hence,

(T f )! · λX = (T f )! · (T a)! · ζ! · ξ · T (a!) ≤ (T b)! · ζ! · ξ · T (b!) · T (f!) = λY · T (f!).

(b) Condition 2 for a lax topological theory and Lemma 3.1(2) give

λX · T yX = c! · ξ · T (a!) · T yX = c! · ξ · T yQ0 · T a ≥ c! · yQ0 · c ≥ yT X .

(c) The adjunction (T (a!))! ⊣ (T (a!))! gives (T (a!))! · (T s)! ≤ (T t)!. Hence, with condition 2

for a lax topological theory and Lemma 3.1(2) one obtains

λX · T sX = c! · ξ · T (a!) · T sX = c! · ξ · T sQ0 · T (a!!)
≥ c! · sQ0 · θ · T (a!!) = sT X · (c!)! · θ · T (a!!)
= sT X · (c!)! · ξ! · (T t)! · ζ! · ξ · T (t!) · T (a!!)
≥ sT X · (c!)! · ξ! · (T (a!))! · (T s)! · ζ! · ξ · T (s!)
= sT X · (c!)! · ξ! · (T (a!))! · (ζ · T s)! · ξ · T (s!) = sT X · (λX )! · λPX .

(d) From ζ · eQ0 = 1Q0 one obtains (eQ0 )! ≤ ζ! by adjunction. Together with condition 3 for a

lax topological theory, this gives

λX · ePX = c! · ξ · T (a!) · ePX = c! · ξ · ePQ0 · a!

≥ (ζ · T a)! · a! ≥ (T a)! · (eQ0 )! · a! = (T a)! · (T a)! · (eX )! ≥ (eX )!.

(e) With d := ζ · T c the array function of T T X, from c · mX = d one obtains (mX )! · d! ≤ c!

by adjunction, so that condition 3 for a topological theory gives

λX · mPX = c! · ξ · T (a!) · mPX = c! · ξ · mPQ0 · T T (a!)

≥ c! · ξ · T ξ · T T (a!) ≥ (mX )! · d! · ξ · T ξ · T T (a!)
≥ (mX )! · d! · ξ · T (c!) · T (c!) · T (ξ) · T T (a!) = (mX )! · λT X · T λX .

Next we show that the topological theory ξ′ induced by λ = λξ equals ξ. Indeed, since ζ is

surjective, one has ζ◦ ◦ ζ◦ = 1T Q0 and therefore

ξ′ = ζ! · λQ0 = ζ! · ζ! · ξ = (ζ◦ ◦ ζ◦)⊙ · ξ = ξ.

Finally, let κ : T P

/ PT be any monotone distributive law inducing ξ, so that ζ! · κQ0 = ξ.

Then

λX = c! · ξ · T (a!) = (T a)! · ζ! · ζ! · κQ0 · T (a!) ≥ (T a)! · κQ0 · T (a!) = (T a)! · T (a!) · κX ≥ κX .

Remark 5.6. (1) When stated in pointwise terms, the deﬁnition of λ = λξ reads as

(λX z)x = (ξ · T (a!)(z))ζ·T a(x),

for all X = (X, a) ∈ Set/Q0, x ∈ T X, z ∈ T PX.

(2) For a topological theory ξ, the structure θ as in Deﬁnition 5.4 always satisﬁes the lax T-unit
and -multiplication laws of Proposition 5.2, since ξ is induced by the monotone distributive law
λξ.

Corollary 5.7. For a quantaloid Q and a Set-monad T that comes equipped with a T-algebra
structure ζ on the set of objects of Q, the assignments

(ξ 7→ λξ) and (λ 7→ ξλ := ζ! · λQ0 )

deﬁne an adjunction between the ordered set of topological theories for T and Q and the conglom-
erate of monotone distributive laws T PQ

/ PQT , ordered componentwise.

Deﬁnition 5.8. A monotone distributive law λ is maximal if it is closed under the correspondence
of Corollary 5.7, that is, if it is induced by some topological theory or, equivalently, by ξλ. More
explicitly then, λ is maximal if, and only if, for all X = (X, a) ∈ Set/Q0,

λX = (T a)! · ζ! · ζ! · λQ0 · T (a!).

Note that this condition simpliﬁes to λX = (T a)! · λQ0 · T (a!) when ζ is bijective.

Corollary 5.9. Maximal monotone distributive laws correspond bijectively to topological theories.

Example 5.10.

(1) For T and λ identical (as in Example 4.1(1)), with ζ = 1Q0 also the induced
map ξ = 1PQ0 is identical, but the maximal law λξ associated with it (by Theorem 5.5) is
not; for a set X with array function |-| : X

/ Q0 one has

λξ
X : PQX

/ PQX, (λξ

X σ)y = _{σx | x ∈ X, |x| = |y|},

for all σ ∈ PX, y ∈ X.

(2) For T = L and the strict distributive law ⊗ of Example 4.1(2), the induced map ξ : LV

/ V
with (v1, ..., vn) 7→ v1 ⊗ ... ⊗ vn is in fact the Eilenberg-Moore structure of the monoid
(V, ⊗, k). The maximal law λξ
/ V with

/ VLX maps (σ1, ..., σn) to the map LX

X : L(VX )

constant value W{σ1(z1) ⊗ ... ⊗ σn(zn) | z1, ..., zn ∈ X}, for every set X.

(3) For Q = DV with V divisible, T = L, and the distributive law and the map ζ : LV

/ V
as in Example 4.1(3) (which coincides with the map ξ of (2) above), the now induced map
ξ : L(PV)

/ PV = PQV is given by

(ξ(σ1, ..., σn))u = _v1⊗...⊗vn=u

v1 ⊗ ... ⊗ σn
σ1

vn :

u

|σ1| ⊗ ... ⊗ |σn|,

for all σ1, ..., σn ∈ PV, u ∈ V.

(4) The map ξ : PV

/ V induced by the law δ of Example 4.1(4) has constant value ⊤.

(5) The map ξ : U V

/ V induced by the ultraﬁlter monad and the law β as in Example 4.1(5)

is given by

ξ(z) = ^C∈z_ C

(= _C∈z^ C, if V is completely distributive),

for every ulltraﬁlter z on V; it plays a central role in [24].

While typically maximal monotone distributive laws are rather special and often allow only for
trivial λ-algebras, especially when Q is a quantale (see Remark 8.4(2)), they do lead to interesting
categories (λ, Q)-Alg when Q is a multi-object quantaloid, including the case when Q = DV for
a quantale V. We can mention here only the easiest case.

Example 5.11. Consider the maximal law λ = λξ induced by the identity map ξ = 1PQ0 of
Example 5.10(1), for any quantaloid Q and T the identity monad on Set/Q0. Writing a(x, y) :=
(py)x for x, y ∈ X and a lax λ-algebra structure p : X
/ PX on a set X with array map
|-| : X

/ Q0, conditions (f), (g) of Deﬁnition 4.2 translate to

1|x| ≤ a(x, x) and (|y| = |y′| =⇒ a(y′, z) ◦ a(x, y) ≤ a(x, z))

for all x, y, y′, z ∈ X. Since in particular a(y, y) ◦ a(x, x) ≤ a(x, y) whenever |x| = |y|, these
conditions are equivalent to

(|x| = |y| =⇒ 1|x| ≤ a(x, y)) and a(y, z) ◦ a(x, y) ≤ a(x, z)

for all x, y, z ∈ X. Consequently then, (λ, Q)-Alg can be seen as the full subcategory of Q-Cat
containing those Q-categories (X, a) satisfying 1|x| ≤ a(x, y)) for all x, y with the same array. In
the case of Q = D[0, ∞] (see Example 2.3(2)), this is the full subcategory of ParMet of those
partial metric spaces (X, a) satisfying the array-invariance condition

for all x, y ∈ X.

a(x, x) = a(y, y) =⇒ a(x, y) = a(x, x)

6. Lax distributive laws of T over PQ versus lax extensions of T to Q-Rel

In this section we give a precise account of the bijective correspondence between monotone
distributive laws of T over PQ and so-called lax extensions of T to Q-Rel, i.e., to the Kleisli
category of PQ, where T is now again an arbitrary monad of Set/Q0, i.e., not necessarily a lifting
of a Set-monad as in Section 5.

Remark 6.1. For future reference, we give a list of identities that will be used frequently in what
follows. In part they have already been used in Section 3, and they all follow from the discrete
7 Z in Q-Rel and
presheaf adjunction that induces PQ. For morphisms ϕ : X
f : X
(1) −→ϕ = ϕ∗ · yY , ϕ = −→ϕ ◦ ◦ εX , ϕ⊙ = sX · −→ϕ !,

/ Y in Set/Q0 one has:

(ϕ⊙)◦ = εY ◦ ϕ;

In what follows, we analyze which of the inequalities required for lax extensions and distributive
laws correspond to each other, starting with the most general scenario. Hence, initially we consider
/ PT X (X ∈ Set/Q0) of maps in Set/Q0, which we will call (T, Q)-
mere families λX : T PX
distribution families, and contrast them with families ˆT ϕ : T X
Y in Q-Rel),
which we refer to as (T, Q)-extension families. Certainly, a distribution family λ = (λX )X deter-
mines an extension family

We see immediately that we may retrieve (λX )X from ( ˆT ϕ)ϕ, by choosing ϕ such that −→ϕ = 1PX ,
7 PX (the co-unit of the adjunction presented in
which is the case precisely when ϕ = εX : X
Section 3). Hence, when assigning to any extension family ˆT = ( ˆT ϕ)ϕ the distribution family

Ψ( ˆT ) = λ = (λX )X with λX :=

−−→
ˆT εX ,

we certainly have ΨΦ(λ) = λ for all distribution families λ. The following Proposition clariﬁes
which extension families correspond bijectively to distribution families. We call an extension
family ˆT monotone if it satisﬁes

∀ϕ, ϕ′ : X

Y

(ϕ ≤ ϕ′ =⇒ ˆT ϕ ≤ ˆT ϕ′),

and monotonicity of a lax distribution family is deﬁned as monotonicity for a lax distributive law
in Section 4.

Proposition 6.2. Φ and Ψ establish a bijective correspondence between all (T, Q)-distribution
families and those (T, Q)-extension families ˆT = ( ˆT ϕ)ϕ which satisfy the left-op-whiskering con-
dition

(0)

ˆT(h◦ ◦ ϕ) = (Th)◦ ◦ ˆTϕ

/ Y in Set/Q0. The correspondence restricts to a bijective
for all ϕ : X
correspondence between the conglomerate (T, Q)-DIS of all monotone distribution families and the
conglomerate (T, Q)-EXT of all monotone extension families satisfying (0).

Y in Q-Rel, h : Z

Proof. For a distribution family λ and ˆT := Φ(λ), let us ﬁrst verify the identity (0), using the
deﬁnition of ˆT and Remark 6.1(2):

−−−→
f ◦ ◦ ϕ) =
Monotonicity of ˆT follows trivially from the corresponding property of λ.

−→
ˆT ϕ · T h = λX · T −→ϕ · T h = λX · T (

−−−−−−−→
(T h)◦ ◦ ˆT ϕ =

−−−−−−→
ˆT (h◦ ◦ ϕ).

Next, for any extension family ˆT satisfying (0), we must show ΦΨ( ˆT ) = ˆT .

Indeed, with

λ := Ψ( ˆT ), the deﬁnition of Φ(λ) and Remark 6.1(1) give

−−−−−−−→
(ΦΨ( ˆT ))ϕ = λX · T −→ϕ =

−−→
ˆT εX · T −→ϕ = ( ˆT εX )⊙ · yPT X · T −→ϕ

= ( ˆT εX )⊙ · ((T −→ϕ )◦)⊙ · yT Y = ( ˆT (−→ϕ ◦ ◦ εX ))⊙ · yT Y = ( ˆT ϕ)⊙ · yT Y =

−→
ˆT ϕ.

That monotonicity of λ follows from the monotonicity of ˆT and (0) is clear once one has

observed that

λX · T f =

−−→
ˆT εX · T f =

−−−−−−−−→
(T f )◦ · ˆT εX =

−−−−−−−→
ˆT (f ◦ · εX )

for all f : Y

/ PX in Set/Q0.

Before pursuing the bijective correspondence further, let us contrast condition (0) with some

other natural conditions for an extension family, as follows.

Proposition 6.3. Let the monotone extension family ˆT satisfy ˆT ψ ◦ ˆT ϕ ≤ ˆT (ψ ◦ ϕ) for all
ϕ, ψ ∈ Q-Rel. Then the following conditions are equivalent when quantiﬁed over the variables
occurring in them (with maps f : X

(T f )◦ ≤ ˆT (f◦).

Proof. (i) ⇒ (iii) The hypotheses, the adjunction f◦ ⊣ f ◦, and the monotonicity give

T X ≤ ˆT (1◦
1◦

X) ≤ ˆT (f ◦ ◦ f◦) = (T f )◦ ◦ ˆT (f◦),

so that (T f )◦ ≤ ˆT (f◦) follows with the adjunction (T f )◦ ⊣ (T f )◦. Furthermore,
Y ) = ˆT (f ◦).

(T f )◦ = (T f )◦ ◦ 1T Y ≤ (T f )◦ ◦ ˆT (1◦

Y ) = ˆT (f ◦ ◦ 1◦

(iii) ⇒ (i) One uses (iii) and the general hypotheses on ˆT to obtain:

(T h)◦ ◦ ˆT ϕ ≤ ˆT (h◦) ◦ ˆT ϕ ≤ ˆT (h◦ ◦ ϕ)

≤ (T h)◦ ◦ (T h)◦ ◦ ˆT (h◦ ◦ ϕ) ≤ (T h)◦ ◦ ˆT (h◦) ◦ ˆT (h◦ ◦ ϕ)
≤ (T h)◦ ◦ ˆT (h◦ ◦ h◦ ◦ ϕ) ≤ (T h)◦ ◦ ˆT ϕ.

(i) ⇔ (ii): One proceeds analogously to (i) ⇔ (iii).

In what follows we compare the conditions on λ ∈ (T, Q)-DIS encountered in Section 4 with
some relevant conditions on the related family ˆT ∈ (T, Q)-EXT under the correspondence of
Proposition 6.2, so that ˆT = Φ(λ), λ = Ψ( ˆT ), all to be read as quantiﬁed over all new variables

and in each of these implications or equivalences one may replace the inequality sign by an equality

A lax extension ˆT of the monad T to Q-Rel is a monotone (T, Q)-extension family satisfying

conditions (0), (2)-(5) for all ϕ : X
i.e., a left-whiskering lax functor ˆT : Q-Rel
/ Q-Rel that coincides with T on objects and
makes e◦ : ˆT

Propositions 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 the following theorem (which corrects and generalizes Exercise III.1.I
in [26]):

Theorem 6.5. There is a bijective correspondence between the monotone distributive laws of the
monad T over PQ and the lax extensions ˆT of T to Q-Rel. These lax extensions are equivalently
described as monotone (T, Q)-extension families ˆT satisfying the following inequalities (for all
f, ϕ, ψ as above):

1. (T f )◦ ≤ ˆT (f◦),
2. (T f )◦ ≤ ˆT (f ◦),

3. (= (3)) ˆTψ ◦ ˆTϕ ≤ ˆT(ψ ◦ ϕ),

4. (eY )◦ ◦ ϕ ≤ ˆT ϕ ◦ (eX )◦,
5. (mY )◦ ◦ ˆT ˆT ϕ ≤ ˆT ϕ ◦ (mX )0.
For a lax extension ˆT of the monad T to Q-Rel we can now deﬁne:

Deﬁnition 6.6. A (T, Q)-category (X, α) is a set X over Q0 equipped with a Q-relation α :
X

T X satisfying the lax unit and multiplication laws

1◦
X ≤ e◦

X ◦ α and ˆT α ◦ α ≤ m◦

X ◦ α.

A (T, Q)-functor f : (X, α)

/ (Y, β) must satisfy

α ◦ f ◦ ≤ (T f )◦ ◦ β.

Hence, the structure of a (T, Q)-category (X, α) consists of a family of Q-morphisms α(x, x) :
|x|X

/ |x|T X (x ∈ X, x ∈ T X), subject to the conditions

1|x| ≤ α(x, eX x) and ˆT α(y, Z) ◦ α(x, y) ≤ α(x, mX Z),

for all x ∈ X, y ∈ T X, Z ∈ T T X. The (T, Q)-functoriality condition for f reads in pointwise form
as

for all x ∈ X, y ∈ T X. The emerging category is denoted by

α(x, y) ≤ β(f x, T f (y))

(T, Q)-Cat;

only if there is the danger of ambiguity will we write (T, ˆT , Q)-Cat to stress the dependency on
the chosen extension ˆT .

Remark 6.7. When Q is a commutative quantale V, then the structure of a (T, V)-category
7 X, and the notion takes on the familiar
(X, α) may be written equivalently as a V-relation T X
meaning (as presented in [26]). However, it is important to note that, because of the switch in
T X (as a lax coalgebra structure) to a lax algebra structure
direction of the V-relation α : X
7 X as in [26], (T, ˆT , V)-Cat deﬁned here actually becomes (T, V, ˇT )-Cat as deﬁned in
T X
[26], III.1, with ˇT ϕ := ( ˆT (ϕ◦))◦ and ϕ◦ : Y
7 X, ϕ(y, x) = ϕ(x, y), for all V-relations ϕ :
X

Y, x ∈ X, y ∈ Y (see Exercise III.1.J in [26]).

Before presenting further examples, let us point out that (T, Q)-categories and -functors are
T X

just disguised lax λ-algebras with their lax homomorphisms, since Q-relations α : X
correspond bijectively to Set/Q0-morphisms p : T X

Proposition 6.8. When λ and T, ˆT are related by the correspondence of Theorem 6.5, then there
is a (natural) isomorphism

(λ, Q)-Alg ∼= (T, ˆT , Q)-Cat

of categories which commutes with the underlying Set/Q0-functors.

Example 6.9.

(1) Let T be a Set-monad with a lax extension ˜T to Rel = 2-Rel that we
now wish to extend further to D2-Rel. As in Proposition 5.1, we ﬁrst consider a T-algebra
structure ζ : T 2
/ 2, which then allows us to consider T as a monad on Set/2, the category
of sets X with a given subset A (see Example 2.3(2)). Of course, one now wishes to compute
T (X, A) as the pair (T X, T A). Since the array function of X is the characteristic function cA
of A, this is possible precisely when the Set-functor T satisﬁes the pullback transformation

and this condition certainly holds when T is taut (i.e., preserves pullbacks of monomor-

declare x to be ˆT ϕ-related to y if, and only if, x ∈ T A, y ∈ T B and x is ˜T ϕ-related to y, to
obtain a lax extension of T to D2-Rel.
With ˜T and the T-algebra structure ζ on 2 given such that ζ−11 = T 1, the objects (X, A, α)
of the category (T, ˆT , D2)-Cat may be described as sets X with a subset A such that (A, α) ∈

one obtains as (L, D[0, ∞])-Cat the category ParMulMet of partial multi-metric spaces

7. Algebraic functors, change-of-base functors

Here we consider the standard types of functors arising from a variation in the two parameters
deﬁning the categories (λ, Q)-Alg ∼= (T, ˆT , Q)-Cat, which have been discussed earlier, in the
quantale-monad-enriched case (see [14, 26]) as well as for T in more general settings (see [11]), but
not in the current monad-quantaloid-enriched context, which does require some extra pecautions.
Let us ﬁrst consider two monads T = (T, m, e), S = (S, n, d) on Set/Q0, both monotonely
distributing over PQ, via the monotone distributive laws λ, κ, respectively; equivalently, both
coming equipped with lax extensions ˆT and ˆS to Q-Rel, respectively. An algebraic morphism
h : (T, ˆT )
7 SX (X ∈ Set/Q0),

satisfying the following conditions for all f : X

(S, ˆS) of lax extensions is a family of Q-relations hX : T X

Putting τX :=

/ λ of monotone

/ PQT X (X ∈ Set/Q0) an algebraic morphism τ : κ

morphisms τX : SX

sT X · (τX )! · κX · Sg ≤ sT X · (λX )! · (T g)! · τY

(lax naturality)
(lax unit law)
(lax multiplication law)
(lax compatibility)

A routine calculation shows:

Proposition 7.1. Every algebraic morphism h : (T, ˆT )
algebraic functor

/ (S, ˆS) of lax extensions induces the

Ah : (T, ˆT , Q)-Cat

/ (S, ˆS, Q)-Cat, (X, α) 7→ (X, hX ◦ α).

When h is equivalently described as an algebraic morphism τ : κ
described as the algebraic functor

/ λ, then Ah is equivalently

Aτ : (λ, Q)-Alg

/ (κ, Q)-Alg, (X, p) 7→ (X, νX · p! · τX ).

Considering S and ˆS identical or, equivalently, κ = 1P, with the algebraic morphism hX = e◦
X

or, equivalently, τX = yT X · eX , one obtains:

Corollary 7.2. For every monad T on Set/Q0 with lax extension ˆT and corresponding monotone
distributive law λ, there is an algebraic functor

A : (T, Q)-Cat

/ Q-Cat, (X, α) 7→ (X, e◦

X ◦ α)

that is equivalently described by

A : (λ, Q)-Alg

/ Q-Cat, (X, p) 7→ (X, p · eX).

Example 7.3. (See [33].) For the powerset monad P = P2 and the ultraﬁlter monad U with their
monotone distributive laws δ and β over PV of Example 4.1(4),(5) and their corresponding lax
extensions ˆP and U to V-Rel, where V = (V, ⊗, k) is a commutative and completely distributive
7 PX, hX (x, A) = k if A ∈ x ∈ U X, and
quantale, the algebraic morphism h with hX : U X
hX (x, A) = ⊥ else, induces the algebraic functor

(U, V)-Cat

/ (P, V)-Cat ∼= V-Cls,

which actually takes values in V-App and facilitates the isomorphism of categories (U, V)-Cat ∼=
V-App already mentioned in equivalent form in Example 4.3(4).

In order to describe change-of-base functors in the general setting of this paper, let us now con-
sider a lax homomorphism ϑ : Q /
/R of quantaloids, so that we have a lax natural transformation
/ PRBϑ0 (see the end of Section 3), and a Set-monad T = (T, m, e) which, according
ϑ : Bϑ0 PQ
to Proposition 5.1, has been lifted to Set/Q0 and Set/R0 via T-algebra structures ζ : T Q0
/ Q0
/ R0 is a T-homomorphism. The liftings
and η : T R0
of T to Set/Q0 and Set/R0 commute with the “discrete change-of-base functor” Bϑ0, that is:
Bϑ0 T = T Bϑ0, Bϑ0 e = eBϑ0, Bϑ0m = mBϑ0 . (These provisions are, of course, trivially satisﬁed
when Q and R are quantales.)

/ R0, respectively, such that ϑ0 : Q0

Extendinging now Bϑ0 to a functor ˜Bϑ : Q-Rel

/ R-Rel by ( ˜Bϑϕ)(x, y) = ϑ(ϕ(x, y)) and
considering lax extensions ˆT , ˇT of T to Q-Rel, R-Rel, respectively, we call ϑ compatible with ˆT , ˇT
if

ˇT ˜Bϑϕ ≤ ˜Bϑ ˆT ϕ

(⋆)

Y in Q-Rel. (Note that the two R-relations in (⋆) are comparable since Bϑ0T =
for all ϕ : X
T Bϑ0.) If we describe the two lax extensions ˆT , ˇT equivalently by the monotone distributive laws
/ PRBϑ0 (see the end
λ, κ, respectively, using the natural lax natural transformation ϑ : Bϑ0 PQ
−→ϕ , we see that (⋆) may equivalently be

−−→
˜Bϑϕ = ϑX · Bϑ0

of Section 3) and the easily veriﬁed rule
formulated as

κBϑ0 · T ϑ ≤ ϑT · Bϑ0 λ

(⋆⋆).

Now we can state the following Proposition, which one may prove using lax extensions and
transcribing the known proof for the quantale case (see [26], III.3.5); alternatively, one may proceed
by using the monotone distributive laws and the lax monad inequalities of ϑ as stated at the end
of Section 3.

Proposition 7.4. Under hypothesis (⋆) one obtains the change-of-base functor

Bϑ : (T, ˆT , Q)-Cat

/ (T, ˇT , R)-Cat, (X, α) 7→ (Bϑ0 X, ˜Bϑα).

Under hypothesis (⋆⋆) this functor is equivalently described as

Bϑ : (λ, Q)-Alg

/ (κ, R)-Alg, (X, p) 7→ (Bϑ0 X, ϑX · Bϑ0p).

Example 7.5. For a commutative and (for simplicity) divisible quantale V, we consider the lax
extensions of the list monad L to V-Rel and DV-Rel induced by the monotone distributive laws of
Example 4.1(2),(3), which we may both denote by ˆL. In fact, for ϕ : X
Y and xi ∈ X, yj ∈ Y
one has

ˆLϕ((x1, ..., xn), (y1, ..., ym)) = ϕ(x1, y1) ⊗ ... ⊗ ϕ(xm, ym) if m = n,

|y1| ⊗ ... ⊗ |yn| in the DV-case, and the value is
to be interpreted as an arrow |x1| ⊗ ... ⊗ |xn|
⊥ otherwise. For the homomorphism ι : V
/ DV and its retractions δ, γ as described in Section
2, one sees that ˜Bι embeds V-Rel fully into DV-Rel, providing every set with the constant array
function with value k, while its retractions ˜Bδ and ˜Bγ are given by ˜Bδϕ(x, y) = |y| ց ϕ(x, y)
and ˜Bγϕ(x, y) = ϕ(x, y) ւ |x|. Since the compatability condition (⋆) holds for all, ι, δ and γ
(strictly so for ι), as “liftings” of the corresponding functors mentioned in Section 2, one obtains

the algebraic functors (L, DV)-Cat
reﬂective embedding

E = EL,V : (L, DV)-Cat

/ (L, V)-Cat/V,

which we brieﬂy describe next, always assuming that V be commutative and divisible. First, in
accordance with the general setting of III.5.3 of [26], we combine the monoid structure of V with its
7 V (see Remark 6.7) given
internal hom and regard V as an (L, V)-category (V, h) with h : LV
by h((v1, ..., vn), u) = (v1 ⊗ ... ⊗ vn) ւ u. Now E provides an (L, DV)-category (X, a) with the
(L, V)-category structure d deﬁned by d((x1, ..., xn), y) = a((x1, ..., xn), , y) ւ a(y, y) and considers
it an (L, V)-category over V via tx = a(x, x). Conversely, the reﬂector provides an (L, V)-category
/ V, with the (L, DV)-category structure
(X, d) that comes equipped with an (L, V)-functor t : X
a deﬁned by a((x1, ..., xn), y) = d((x1, ..., xn), y) ⊗ ty.

In the case V = [0, ∞] the functor E becomes an isomorphism of categories, so that in the

notation of Example 6.9(2) one has

ParMulMet ∼= MulMet/[0, ∞].

Therefore, just as described in Section 2 in the “non-multi” case, the standard construction of a
right adjoint to the functor Σ : MulMet/[0, ∞]
/ MulMet therefore gives a right adjoint to
Bγ : ParMulMet

/ MulMet.

8. Comparison with Hofmann’s topological theories

In [24], for a Set-monad T = (T, m, e) and a commutative quantale V = ((V, ⊗, k), Hofmann

considers maps ξ : T V

/ V satisfying the following conditions:

ξ · T ξ ≤ ξ · mV

1. 1V ≤ ξ · eV,
2*. k · ζ ≤ ξ · T k, ⊗ · (ξ × ξ) · can ≤ ξ · T (⊗)

(naturality).

/V and V×V

Here k and ⊗ are considered as maps 1
/T V×T V
is the canonical map with components T π1, T π2, where π1, π2 are product projections, and (in
/ 1 is the unique map onto a
accordance with the notation introduced in Proposition 5.1) ζ : T 1
singleton set 1. Note that Hofmann [24] combined conditions 3 and 4 to a single axiom; however,
the separation as given above (and in [16]) is easily seen to be equivalent with Hofmann’s combined
axiom and will make the comparison with the conditions of Deﬁnition 5.4 more transparent.

/V, respectively; can : T (V×V)

Let us now compare these conditions with conditions 0–3 for a topological theory as given in
Deﬁnition 5.4, in the case that Q = V is a commutative quantale. First we give a direct comparison
of condition 2* with condition 2 of Deﬁnition 5.4 which, in the current context, reads as follows:

2. y1 · ζ ≤ ξ · T y1, s1 · θ ≤ ξ · T s1

(lax T homom. laws);

here ζ : T 1
implies the former, as we show ﬁrst.

Proposition 8.1. Every map ξ : T V

/ V satisfying condition 2 satisﬁes condition 2*.

Proof. Since k = y1, the ﬁrst inequality of condition 2 actually coincides with the ﬁrst inequality
of condition 2*. The crucial ingredient to comparing the second inequalities in both conditions is
the map

χ : V × V

/ PVV = VV, χ(u, v)(w) = u ⊗ (yVv)(w) = (cid:26) u

⊥ else

if w = v,

(cid:27) ,

since, as one easily veriﬁes, s1 · χ = ⊗. It now suﬃces to show

(∗)

χ · (ξ × ξ) · can ≤ θ · T χ;

indeed, one can then conclude from s1 · θ ≤ ξ · T s1 the desired inequality, as follows:

⊗ · (ξ × ξ) · can = s1 · χ · (ξ × ξ) · can ≤ s1 · θ · T χ ≤ ξ · T s1 · T χ = ξ · T (⊗).

In order to check (∗), let w ∈ T (V × V) and z ∈ V. On one hand, with x := T π1(w), y := T π2(w),
one obtains

(χ · (ξ × ξ) · can(w))(z) = χ(ξ(x), ξ(y))(z) = (cid:26) ξ(x)

⊥

if z = ξ(y),
else

(cid:27) ,

and on the other, with z := T χ(w), and since t! · χ = π1, one obtains

(θ · T χ(w))(z) = (ξ! · (ζ · T t)! · ξ · T (t!)(z))(z)

= _a∈T V,ξ(a)=z
= _a∈T V,ξ(a)=z

((ζ · T t)! · ξ · T (t!)(z))(z)

ξ(T (t!)(z)) = (cid:26) ξ(x)

⊥

if ∃ a ∈ T V (ξ(a) = z)
else

(cid:27) ,

which shows (∗).

Next we will show that, in the presence of conditions 1, 3, 4, conditions 2 and 2* become
equivalent, provided that the Set-functor T of T satisﬁes the Beck-Chevalley condition (BC), that
is: if T transforms (weak) pullback diagrams in Set into weak pullback diagrams (see [24, 26]).
Note that the Set-functors of both L and U satisfy BC.

Calling a topological theory ξ (as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 5.4) natural if ξ satisﬁes condition 4

above, we can show:

Theorem 8.2. For a commutative quantale V and a Set-monad T with T satisfying the Beck-
Chevalley condition, the natural topological theories for T and V are characterized as the maps ξ
satisfying Hofmann’s conditions 1, 2*, 3, 4.

Proof. From Proposition 8.1 we know that every natural topological theory satisﬁes Hofmann’s
conditions. Conversely, having ξ satisfying Hofmann’s conditions, since T satisﬁes BC, one can
deﬁne the induced lax Barr-Hofmann extension Tξ of T, as given in Deﬁnition 3.4 of [24]:

(Tξϕ)(x, y) = _{ξ · (T |ϕ|)(w) | w ∈ T (X × Y ), T π1(w) = x, T π2(w) = y},

(†)

for all V-relations ϕ : X
/ V denoting the map giving
the values of ϕ. Let λ := Ψ(Tξ) be the corresponding monotone distributive law (see Theorem
6.5), and ξ = ξλ the induced topological theory (see Proposition 5.2), i.e.,

Y, x ∈ T X, y ∈ T Y , with |ϕ| : X × Y

ξ = ζ! · λ1 = ζ! ·

ξ(a) = _{(Tξε1)(b, a) | b ∈ T 1} = _{ξ(w) | w ∈ T V, T π2(w) = a} = ξ(a),

Consequently, since ξ is induced by a monotone distributive law, ξ = ξ is a topological theory,
with naturality given by hypothesis.

In [16] we showed that, when T satisﬁes BC, the assignment ξ 7→ Tξ of (†) deﬁnes a bijective

(The proof of this characterization is easily reconstructed by following the proof of Theorem 8.5
below.) We therefore obtain with Theorem 8.2:

Corollary 8.3. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 8.2, the assignment ξ 7→ Tξ of (†) deﬁnes a
bijective correspondence between the natural topological theories for T and V and the left-whiskering
and algebraic lax extensions of T to V-Rel.

Caution is needed when reading this chart as a diagram, as it commutes only in a limited way.

The following Remark and Theorem shed light on this cautionary note..

Remark 8.4.

(1) The Proof of Theorem 8.2 shows that, starting with a natural topological
theory and, under the provisions of Theorem 8.2 on V and T, chasing it counterclockwise all
around the chart, one arrives at the same topological theory.

(2) However, under the assumptions of Theorem 8.2 on V and T, chasing a natural topological
theory ξ upwards on the two possible paths one obtains very diﬀerent types of lax monad
extensions; their typical properties appear to be almost disjoint. Most remarkably, assigning
to ξ the maximal monotone distributive law λξ and then the lax monad extension ˆT = Φ(λξ),
one observes easily that, for ϕ : X

Y, x ∈ T X, y ∈ T Y and a : X

/ 1,

ˆT ϕ(x, y) = ξ(T (a! · −→ϕ )(y))

does not depend on x! But also the other path up (ξ 7→ Tξ) leads to quite special monad
extensions, since being left-whiskering and algebraic are restrictive properties which, for
example, exclude all extensions ˆT that fail to satisfy the symmetry condition ˆT (ϕ◦) = ( ˆT ϕ)◦
(see Remark 6.7), in particular the important extensions ﬁrst considereded by Seal [47]. In
fact, in the following theorem we give a context in which Tξ is described as minimal among
extension families inducing ξ.

For a commutative quantale V and a Set-monad T = (T, m, e), continuing to use the notations
Y in V-Rel, let us call an extension family

/ T X ×
for all ϕ, and algebraic, if “ ≥ ” may always be replaced by “=”; here canX,Y : T (X × Y )
T Y is the canonical map. (Note that this deﬁnition of algebraicity is just an element-free ren-
dering of the deﬁnition given above in the narrower context of lax extensions.) Denoting by
(T, V)-EXTadm the conglomerate of all admissible, left-op-whiskering and monotone extension
families of T (see Proposition 6.2), one has a monotone map

Ξ : (T, V)-EXTadm

with their order given pointwise as in V. The following Theorem shows that this map is an order
embedding and has a right adjoint, given by

Theorem 8.5. Let T : Set
T V
extension families ˆT with Ξ( ˆT ) = ξ.

Proof. First we verify that Tξ is left-op-whiskering, so that it satisﬁes condition (0) of Proposition
6.2. Indeed, for ϕ : X

/ Y , with |h◦ ◦ ϕ| = |ϕ| · (1X × h) one obtains

Y and h : Z

(Tξ(h◦ ◦ ϕ))1 = (canX,Z)◦ ◦ (T |h◦ ◦ ϕ|)◦ ◦ ξ◦ ◦ ε1 = (canX,Z )◦ ◦ (T (1 × h))◦ ◦ (T |ϕ|)◦ ◦ ξ◦ ◦ ε1.

Since the satisfaction of BC by T forces

(canX,Z )◦ ◦ (T (1 × h))◦ = (1T X × T h)◦ ◦ (canX,Y )◦

(see Proposition 1.4.3 of [16]), the previous identity gives (Tξ(h◦ ◦ϕ))1 = ((T h)◦ ◦Tξϕ)1, as desired.
For admissibility of Tξ, ﬁrst an easy inspection shows ξ◦ ◦ ε1 = Tξε1 ◦ ζ◦. Since Tξ is left-op-

whiskering, this identity and ϕ1 = |ϕ|◦ ◦ ε1 in fact conﬁrm even its algebraicity:

(Tξϕ)1 = (canX,Y )◦ ◦ (T |ϕ|)◦ ◦ Tξε1 ◦ ζ◦ = (canX,Y )◦ ◦ Tξ(|ϕ|◦ ◦ ε1) ◦ ζ◦ = (canX,Y )◦ ◦ Tξ(ϕ1) ◦ ζ◦.

For an arbitrary admissible, left-op-whiskering and monotone ˆT with Ξ( ˆT ) = ξ, we ﬁrst use

the left-op-whiskering property to obtain ˆT (ϕ1) = (T |ϕ|)◦ ◦ ˆT ε1 and then

−−−−−−−→
ˆT (ϕ1) ◦ ζ◦ = ζ! ·

−−−→
ˆT (ϕ1) = ζ! ·

−−→
ˆT ε1 · T |ϕ| = ξ · T |ϕ|.

Consequently, the admissibility of ˆT gives the desired inequality

(Tξϕ)1 = (canX,Y )◦◦(T |ϕ|)◦◦ξ◦◦ε1 = (canX,Y )◦◦(

−−−−−−−→
ˆT (ϕ1) ◦ ζ◦)◦◦ε1 = (canX,Y )◦◦ ˆT (ϕ1)◦ζ◦ ≤ ( ˆT ϕ)1,

which conﬁrms the minimality of Tξ.
