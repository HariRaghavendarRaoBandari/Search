Abstract

Hadamard ideals were introduced in 2006 as a set of nonlinear polynomial equations whose
zeros are uniquely related to Hadamard matrices with one or two circulant cores of a given
order. Based on this idea, the cocyclic Hadamard test enable us to describe a polynomial ideal
that characterizes the set of cocyclic Hadamard matrices over a ﬁxed ﬁnite group G of order 4t.
Nevertheless, the complexity of the computation of the reduced Gr¨obner basis of this ideal is
2O(t2), which is excessive even for very small orders. In order to improve the eﬃciency of this
polynomial method, we take advantage of some recent results on the inner structure of a cocyclic
matrix to describe an alternative polynomial ideal that also characterizes the mentioned set of
cocyclic Hadamard matrices over G. The complexity of the computation decreases in this way to
2O(n), where n is the number of G-coboundaries. Particularly, we design two speciﬁc procedures
for looking for Zt × Z2
2-cocyclic Hadamard matrices and D4t-cocyclic Hadamard matrices, so
that larger cocyclic Hadamard matrices (up to t ≤ 31) are explicitly obtained.

Key words: Hadamard matrix, basis of cocycles, polynomial ring, ideal.

Introduction.

A Hadamard matrix H of order n is an n × n matrix with every entry either 1 or
−1, which satisﬁes HH T = nI, where I is the identity matrix of order n. Although it
is well-known that n has to be necessarily 1, 2 or a multiple of 4 (as soon as three or
more rows have to be simultaneously orthogonal), there is no certainty whether such a
Hadamard matrix exists at every possible order. Currently, the smallest order for which
no Hadamard matrix is known is 668. The Hadamard conjecture asserts that there exists
a Hadamard matrix of order 4t for every natural number t.

There exist so many diﬀerent constructions for Hadamard matrices: Sylvester, Pa-
ley, Williamson, Ito, Goethals-Seidel, one and two circulant cores or cocyclic matrices,
amongst others (see Horadam (2007)). Nevertheless, most of them fail to yield Hadamard
matrices for every order which is a multiple of 4 and therefore are not suitable candi-
dates for a proof of the Hadamard conjecture. Among all these constructions, it seems
that the two most promising are the Goethals-Seidel arrays and the cocyclic construc-
tions. Actually, the one and two circulant cores constructions have recently been de-
scribed to be somehow cocyclic-based (the cores themselves are cocyclic over Z4t−1
and D4t−2, respectively). A stronger version of the Hadamard conjecture, posed by
Horadam and de Launey (1995) is the cocyclic Hadamard conjecture: this states that
there exists a cocyclic Hadamard matrix at every possible order. Currently the smallest
order for which no cocyclic Hadamard matrix is known is 188.

Kotsireas et al. (2006a) introduced the concept of Hadamard ideal as a set of nonlinear
polynomial equations whose zeros determine the set of Hadamard matrices with one
circulant core. Shortly after, Kotsireas et al. (2006b) used the same ideal together with
a series of new polynomials in order to determine the set of Hadamard matrices with
two circulant cores, by means of which they computed the Hadamard matrices with two
circulant cores up to order 52.

In this paper, we deﬁne several cocyclic Hadamard ideals, whose zeros determine the
set of cocyclic Hadamard matrices over a ﬁnite group G of order 4t. Based on the cocyclic
test of Horadam and de Launey (1995), our ﬁrst approach (Theorem 1) gives rise to a
procedure CocGM(t, G, opt) which works just for very small t, actually t ≤ 3. In order
to improve the eﬃciency of this polynomial method and provided a basis of G-cocycles
is known, we deﬁne in Theorem 3 an alternative ideal based upon the system of equa-
tions described by ´Alvarez et al. (2008), which also characterize the set of G-cocyclic
Hadamard matrices. This gives a procedure CocCB(t, G, opt) suitable for larger values of
t. Furthermore, from the knowledge of the properties of cocyclic matrices over Zt × Z2
2
and D4t described by ´Alvarez et al. (2015, 2016), improved versions of this procedure
(CocAH(t, col, dist, H) and CocDH(t, opt, H), based on Theorems 5 and 7, respectively)
are used to perform local searches for Zt × Z2
2-cocyclic Hadamard matrices and D4t-
cocyclic Hadamard matrices, so that matrices of order up to 4t ≤ 124 are found.

All the procedures have been implemented as a library hadamard.lib in the open com-
puter algebra system for polynomial computations Singular, developed by Decker et al.
(2016). Examples illustrating the use of this library and the library itself are available
online at http://personales.us.es/raufalgan/LS/hadamard.lib.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The ﬁrst part of Section 2 is
devoted to describe some preliminary concepts and results on Hadamard matrices and

2

algebraic geometry, that are used in the rest of the paper. Later, we deﬁne a zero-
dimensional ideal that determines the set of cocyclic Hadamard matrices over a given
group G of order 4t, which comes from a straightforward translation of the cocyclic
Hadamard test of Horadam and de Launey (1995). In Section 3, we propose an alter-
native to the previous construction by deﬁning a new zero-dimensional ideal, based on
the results of ´Alvarez et al. (2008). Actually, we particularize this procedure for Zt × Z2
2-
cocyclic Hadamard matrices and D4t-cocyclic Hadamard matrices, attending to the prop-
erties described by ´Alvarez et al. (2015, 2016). The last section is devoted to conclusions
and outlines for further work.

2. Preliminaries.

We expose in this section some basic concepts and results on Hadamard matrices and
algebraic geometry that are used throughout the paper. We refer to the monographs
of Mac Lane (1995), Horadam (2007), De Launey and Flannery (2011) and Cox et al.
(1998, 2007) for more details about these topics.

Assume throughout that G = {g1 = 1, . . . , g4t} is a multiplicative ﬁnite group of 4t
elements, not necessarily abelian. A function ψ : G × G → h−1i ∼= Z2 is said to be a
(binary) cocycle over G, or simply G-cocycle for short, if it satisﬁes that

ψ(gi, gj)ψ(gigj, gk) = ψ(gj, gk)ψ(gi, gjgk), for all gi, gj, gk ∈ G.

(1)

The cocycle ψ is naturally displayed as a cocyclic matrix Mψ whose (i, j)th entry is
ψ(gi, gj) for all gi, gj ∈ G. Since it must be ψ(1, gj) = ψ(gi, 1) for all gi, gj ∈ G, the
ﬁrst row and column of Mψ are all either 1 or −1. In the ﬁrst case, the cocycle ψ and
its cocyclic matrix Mψ are said to be normalized. There is a one to one correspondence
between normalized and non normalized cocycles. In what follows, we reduce ourselves
to normalized cocycles, for commodity.

Given gd ∈ G, the elementary coboundary ∂d is the cocycle over G deﬁned as

∂d(i, j) := δgd (gi)δgd (gj)δgd (gigj),

where δgd : G → {−1, 1} is the characteristic set map such that δgd (gi) = −1 if gi = gd
and 1, otherwise. The generalized coboundary matrix M ∂d consists of negating the dth-
row of the matrix M∂d . Note that negating a row or a column of a matrix does not change
its Hadamard character. This is just a particular case of a more general set: there is an
equivalence relation (termed Hadamard equivalence) on Hadamard matrices, so that two
matrices are Hadamard equivalent whenever they diﬀer in a series of row and/or column
negations and/or permutations.

´Alvarez et al. (2008) proved that every generalized coboundary matrix M ∂d has the

following properties

a) M ∂d contains exactly two negative entries in each row s 6= 1, which are located at

positions (s, d) and (s, e), for ge = g−1

s gd.

b) Given gs 6= 1 and gc in G, there are exactly two generalized coboundary matrices

(M ∂c and M ∂d ), with a negative entry in the position (s, c), where gd = gsgc.

c) Two generalized coboundary matrices share their two negative entries at the sth row

if and only if g2

s = 1.

1 · · · ψxk

A basis B = {ψ1, . . . , ψk} of cocycles over G consists of some elementary coboundaries
∂i and some representative cocycles. Every cocycle over G admits a unique representation
as a product of the generators in B, ψ = ψx1
k , xi ∈ Z2. The tuple (x1, . . . , xk)B
deﬁnes the coordinates of ψ with regards to B. Accordingly, every cocyclic matrix Mψ =
(ψ(i, j)), for ψ = (x1, . . . , xk)B, admits a unique decomposition Mψ = M x1
as
ψ1
the Hadamard pointwise product of those matrices Mψi corresponding to entries xi = 1.
In general, the number of elements of B is an open question. Furthermore, since the
elementary coboundary ∂1 related to the identity element 1 ∈ G is not normalized,
we may assume that ∂1 /∈ B. In what follows, we use generalized coboundary matrices
instead of classical coboundary matrices. Let us point out that any matrix obtained as
the Hadamard product of generalized coboundary matrices and representative cocycles
is Hadamard equivalent to a cocyclic matrix by means of negations of certain rows.

· · · M xk
ψk

A cocycle ψ (over G) is said to be orthogonal if its cocyclic matrix Mψ is Hadamard.
In such a case, Mψ is said to be a a cocyclic Hadamard matrix over G. The set of
cocyclic Hadamard matrices over G is denoted by HG. The cocyclic Hadamard test
of Horadam and de Launey (1995) asserts that a normalized cocyclic matrix Mψ is
Hadamard if and only if

ψ(i, j) = 0, for all i ∈ G \ {1}.

(2)

Xj∈G

A row of Mψ is termed Hadamard row precisely when its summation is zero. This way,
Mψ is Hadamard if and only if every row (but the ﬁrst) is a Hadamard row.

We expose now some basic concepts of algebraic geometry. Let X and K[X] be, re-
spectively, the set of m variables {x1, . . . , xm} and the related multivariate polynomial
ring over a ﬁeld K. The aﬃne variety V (I) of an ideal I ⊆ K[X] is the set of points in
Km that are zeros of all the polynomials of I. The ideal I is said to be zero-dimensional
if V (I) is ﬁnite. It is said to be radical if every polynomial p ∈ K[X] belongs to I when-
ever there exists a natural number n such that pn ∈ I. A term order < on the set of
monomials of K[X] is a multiplicative well-ordering that has the constant monomial 1
as its smallest element. The largest monomial of a polynomial p of I with respect to the
term order < is its leading monomial. The ideal generated by the leading monomials of
all the non-zero elements of I is its initial ideal I<. Those monomials of polynomials of
I that are not leading monomials of any polynomial of I are called standard monomials.
If the ideal I is zero-dimensional, then the number of standard monomials of I coincides
with the dimension of K[X]/I over K, which is greater than or equal to the number of
points of V (I). The equality holds when I is radical. This dimension can be obtained by
computing the Hilbert function HFK[X]/I , which maps each non-negative integer d onto
dimk(K[X]d/Id), where K[X]d denotes the set of homogeneous polynomials in K[X] of

degree d and Id = K[X]d ∩ I. In particular, dimk(K[X]/I) = P0≤d HFK[X]/I (d). If the

ideal I is zero-dimensional, then the number HFK[X]/I (d) coincides with the set of stan-
dard monomials of degree d, regardless of the term order. As a consequence, the Hilbert
function of K[X]/I coincides with that of K[X]/I<, for any term order <, which can
be obtained by using for instance the algorithm of Mora and M¨oller (1983). Previously,
it is required to determine the initial ideal I<. In any case, Bayer and Stillman (1992)
already proved that the problem of computing Hilbert functions is NP-complete.

4

A Gr¨obner basis of the ideal I is any subset GB of polynomials of I whose leading
monomials with respect to a given term order generate the initial ideal I<. It is reduced
if all its polynomials are monic and no monomial of a polynomial in GB is generated
by the leading monomials of the rest of polynomials in the basis. There exists only one
reduced Gr¨obner basis of the ideal I. This basis generates the initial ideal I< and can
be used, therefore, to determine the cardinality of its aﬃne variety V (I). Further, the
points of this variety can been enumerated once the reduced Gr¨obner basis is decomposed
into ﬁnitely many disjoint subsets, each of them being formed by the polynomials of a
triangular system of polynomial equations, whose factorization and subsequent resolution
are easier than the system related to the generators of the original ideal I. See in this
regard the articles of Hillebrand (1999), Lazard (1992) and M¨oller (1993).

Gr¨obner bases can be used, therefore, to determine both the cardinality and the el-
ements of the set HG of cocyclic Hadamard matrices over a multiplicative ﬁnite group
G of 4t elements. Let Q[XG] be the polynomial ring over the set of variables {XG} =
{xi,j : gi, gj ∈ G} and let us deﬁne the polynomial

pi,j,k(X) := xi,j − xij,kxj,kxi,jk, for all gi, gj, gk ∈ G,

where the products ij and jk are induced by the group law in G. The next result shows
how the set HG of cocyclic Hadamard matrices over G can be identiﬁed with the aﬃne
variety deﬁned by a zero-dimensional radical ideal of nonlinear polynomials in Q[XG].

Theorem 1. The set HG can be identiﬁed with the set of zeros of the zero-dimensional
ideal

IG := h x2

i,j − 1, x1,j − 1, xi,1 − 1 : i, j ∈ G \ {1} i + h pi,j,k(X) : i, j, k ∈ G i +

xi,j : i ∈ G \ {1} i ⊂ Q[XG].

hXj∈G

Besides, |HG| = dimQ(Q[XG]/IG).

Proof. Let P = (pi,j) be a point of the aﬃne variety V (IG). From the ﬁrst subideal of
IG, every component pi,j of P is either 1 or −1, for all i, j ∈ G. Let ψ : G × G → {±1}
be deﬁned such that ψ(i, j) = pi,j, for all gi, gj ∈ G. Since the second subideal of IG
implies that ψ satisﬁes identity (1) for all gi, gj, gk ∈ G, the point P can be identiﬁed
with the cocyclic matrix Mψ related to ψ. Finally, the third subideal of IG implies that
Mψ satisﬁes identity (2) and hence, Mψ is Hadamard. The aﬃne variety V (IG) coincides,
therefore, with the set HG, whose ﬁniteness involves the ideal IG to be zero-dimensional.
Besides, since IG ∩ Q[xi,j] = h x2
ij − 1 i ⊆ IG for all i, j ∈ G, Proposition 2.7 of Cox et al.
(1998) involves IG to be radical and hence, |HG| = |V (IG)| = dimQ(Q[XG]/IG). ✷

Notice that the computation of the reduced Gr¨obner basis of a zero-dimensional ideal
is extremely sensitive to the number of variables. See in this regard the articles of Hashemi
(2009), Hashemi and Lazard (2011), Lakshman (1991) and Lakshman and Lazard (1991).
In the last reference, the authors proved that the complexity of our computation is dO(n),
where d is the maximal degree of the polynomials of the ideal and n is the number of

5

variables. In the case of Theorem 1, this complexity is 2O(t2), which renders the compu-
tation only possible for very low values of t that are not useful to analyze the Hadamard
conjecture. Thus, for instance, using our procedure CocGM(t, G, opt) in an Intel Core i7-
2600, with a 3.4 GHz processor and 16 GB of RAM, the computation of the reduced
Gr¨obner bases of the ideals related to the group Zt × Z2
2 and the dihedral group D4t are
only feasible for t ≤ 3. For higher orders, the system runs out of memory. Notice that,
depending on whether the parameter opt is equal to 1 or 2, the procedure calculates
either just the number of cocyclic Hadamard matrices over G or the explicit full set of
these matrices.

In Section 3 we deﬁne another ideal JG for computing HG in a more subtle way,
progressing on the previous work of ´Alvarez et al. (2008) and provided a basis for cocy-
cles over G is known. Unfortunately, it will be still extremely hard to compute HG for
large |G|. Nevertheless, taking advantage of the properties of cocyclic matrices over D4t
2 described by ´Alvarez et al. (2015, 2016), this ideal JG may be speciﬁcally
and Zt × Z2
simpliﬁed for computing HD4t and HZt×Z2

in a better way.

Ideals built from a basis for G-cocycles

In order to reduce the complexity of the computation of the reduced Gr¨obner basis that
has been exposed in the previous section, we consider a new zero-dimensional radical ideal
JG related to the set HG, where we diminish the number of variables and the maximal
degree of the polynomials progressing on the knowledge of an explicit basis for cocycles
over G.

Let G be a multiplicative ﬁnite group of order 4t, B = {ψ1, . . . , ψk} be a basis
for normalized cocycles over G and ψ be a normalized cocycle over G of coordinates
i,j denote the (i, j)th entry of Mψd, so that the
(x1, . . . , xk)B with regards to B. Let md
i,j )xk . Recall that normalized cocyclic Hadamard
(i, j)th entry of Mψ is (m1
matrices are precisely those matrices that are built up from Hadamard rows (excepting
the ﬁrst row, consisting all of 1s). In these circumstances, the ith-row of the previous
matrix Mψ is Hadamard if and only if

The next result holds.

Theorem 2 ( ´Alvarez et al. (2008)). The matrix Mψ is Hadamard if and only if the
vector of coordinates (x1, . . . , xk)B of ψ with regards to B satisﬁes the following system

✷

The solutions of the system (3) constitute precisely the whole set of normalized co-
cyclic Hadamard matrices over G. Trying to solve this system may be as complicated
as performing an exhaustive search for cocyclic Hadamard matrices over G. Instead, we
intend to translate the system (3) in terms of a set of nonlinear Q[X]-polynomial equa-
tions over the set of variables {X} = {x1, . . . , xk} (whose 0, 1 values are related to the
coordinates of G-cocycles with regards to B), and to study the structure of the associated
ideal.

A succinct algebraic description of the quadratic constrains {X} ⊂ {0, 1}k is provided

by the following set of k algebraic equations:

xi(xi − 1) = 0,

for all i ∈ {1, . . . , k}.

(4)

In order to deﬁne the rest of polynomial equations that arise from the system (3), we use
the next two main ideas or simpliﬁcations:

• From a practical point of view, we may assume we work with a ﬁxed representative
cocycle ρ among all of the possible choices of representative cocycles. In fact, empir-
ically, in the groups most intensively studied, there always exists a better combina-
tion of representative cocycles for producing Hadamard matrices. See in this regard
the works of ´Alvarez et al. (2008, 2015, 2016), Baliga and Horadam (1995), Flannery
(1997) and Horadam (2007). We will denote by Mρ = (ri,j ) the matrix related to
the Hadamard product ρ of these representative cocycles. Obviously, this pruning in
the searching space might eliminate some cocyclic Hadamard matrices. If we want
to ﬁnd the whole set of cocyclic Hadamard matrices, we have to perform an anal-
ogous search for the other possible choices of Mρ. In what follows we assume that
ψ1, . . . , ψk−m ∈ B are G-coboundaries, ψk−m+1, . . . , ψk ∈ B are representative G-
is a ﬁxed linear combination of these representative

i=k−m+1 ψxi

i

cocycles and ρ = Qk

cocycles.

• The second property of the generalized coboundary matrices implies that the hth sum-
l+1,h)xj , for i and j
mand of the lth equation in (3) reduces to be rl+1,h(mi
deﬁning the (unique) two generalized coboundaries M ∂i and M ∂j sharing a negative
entry in the position (l + 1, h). Notice that, eventually, one or even the two of these
coboundaries ∂i, ∂j might not be in B.

l+1,h)xi (mj

Actually, the monomial sl,h(X) related to the mentioned hth summand of the lth
equation in (3) depends on whether the two, just one or none of the coboundaries ∂i, ∂j
(precisely those whose related generalized coboundary matrices contribute a negative
entry at position (l + 1, h)) are in B. More concretely,

• If ∂i, ∂j, ∈ B, then

• If just ∂i ∈ B, then

• If ∂i, ∂j, /∈ B, then

sl,h(X) := rl+1,h (1 − 2xi)(1 − 2xj).

sl,h(X) := rl+1,h (1 − 2xi).

sl,h(X) := rl+1,h.

✷

Observe in particular that, according to Lakshman and Lazard, the complexity of the
computation of the reduced Gr¨obner decreases from 2O(t2) in Theorem 1 to 2O(k−m) in
Theorem 3. In order to check the eﬃciency of this alternative, we have implemented
in our library hadamard.lib a second procedure called CocCB(t, G, opt) that determines,
depending on whether opt = 1 or 2, the number or the explicit set of cocyclic Hadamard
matrices developed over a given group G. The procedure has been tested in the computa-
tion of the number of cocyclic Hadamard matrices developed over the group Zt × Z2
2 and
the dihedral group D4t of order 4t. Speciﬁcally, we have run the procedure in a system
with an Intel Core i7-2600, 3.4 GHz and Ubuntu. Running times are exposed in Table 1.

Actually, this procedure CocCB(t, G, opt) might be improved if a deeper knowledge
about the inner structure of cocyclic matrices over G is known. In particular, progressing
on the works of ´Alvarez et al. (2015, 2016), we have been able to design two speciﬁc pro-
cedures for looking for Zt × Z2
2-cocyclic Hadamard matrices and D4t-cocyclic Hadamard
matrices, so that larger cocyclic Hadamard matrices (up to t ≤ 31) are obtained. The
details are exposed in the next two subsections.

3.1. The group Zt × Z2

Consider the group G = Zt × Z2

2, t > 1 odd, with ordering

G = {(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0), . . ., (t, 1, 1)},

8

indexed as {1, . . . , 4t}. A basis B = {∂2, . . . , ∂4t−2, β1, β2, β3} for cocycles over G is
described by ´Alvarez et al. (2008, 2009), and consists of 4t − 3 coboundaries and three
representative cocycles. As usual, ∂i refers to the coboundary associated to the ith-
element in G. An explicit description of these cocycles was exposed by ´Alvarez et al.
(2008). Notice that all cocyclic Hadamard cocyclic matrices over Zt × Z2
2 known so far
use all the three representative cocycles β1, β2 and β3 simultaneously (see the paper of
Baliga and Horadam (1995) for details). Thus, we assume

Mρ = 1t ⊗

and hence, we restrict (4) to the equations related to the 4t − 3 coboundaries, that is,

xi(xi − 1) = 0,

for all i ∈ {1, . . . , 4t − 3}.

Let us point out that the system (3) is equivalent to the one built up with the equations
from the 4th to the (2t + 1)th (see the works of ´Alvarez et al. (2008, 2015)). So, we have
only 2t − 2 polynomials of the form Sl(X) = sl,1(X) + . . . + sl,4t(X). Before computing
the monomials sl,h(X), we state the following lemma, which follows straightforwardly by
inspection. In the sequel, [n]m denotes n mod m for short.

Lemma 4. Given the position (s, c) with 5 ≤ s ≤ 2t + 2 and 1 ≤ c ≤ 4t, the two
generalized coboundary matrices with entries −1 at the position (s, c) are M ∂c and

Taking into account this lemma and the basis B of cocycles, we compute the monomials

Actually, some additional assumptions, as those exposed by ´Alvarez et al. (2015),
2-cocyclic Hadamard matrices Mψ =

may be considered. Coboundaries ∂i on Zt × Z2

MρQi∈I M∂i are somehow symmetrically distributed, in the sense that the relation

4k + j ∈ I ⇔ 4t − 4k + j ∈ I, 1 ≤ k ≤ t−1
2 , 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, holds. Furthermore, the
1 ≤ j ≤ 4}, for a ﬁxed
number ck of coboundaries of each subset {4k + j ∈ I :
2 ≤ k ≤ t, satisﬁes c1 − ck ≡ 1 mod 2. And the number rj of coboundaries of each subset
{4k + j ∈ I : 1 ≤ k ≤ t}, for 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, give rise to a tuple dist = (r1, r2, r3, r4) (termed
distribution by ´Alvarez et al. (2015)) which certainly satisﬁes some additional properties.

Any Zt ×Z2

2-cocyclic matrix Mψ = MρQi∈I M∂i may be uniquely identiﬁed as a (4×t)

binary matrix Dψ = (djk) (termed diagram by ´Alvarez et al. (2015)), such that djk = 1
if and only if 4(k − 1) + j ∈ I. The conditions described above have a straightforward
translation in terms of Dψ. More concretely,

• column i of Dψ is equal to column t + 2 − i, for 2 ≤ i ≤ t.
• the sum of column 2 ≤ j ≤ t of Dψ is of diﬀerent parity of that of column 1 of Dψ.
• the sum of each row of Dψ gives the distribution dist = (r1, r2, r3, r4).

Thus the method may be improved, as soon as the distribution dist and the number
of coboundaries per column col = (c2, . . . , c t−1
) are provided. We have implemented this
method as a Singular procedure called CocAH(t, col, dist, H). Since exhaustive calcu-
lations are not feasible for t ≥ 11, we have included in this procedure a new parameter
H = (x2, . . . , x2t+2), which determines which coboundaries are ﬁxed (xi = 1 means ∂i
is used, whereas xi = 0 implies ∂i is not used), and which of them are unknowns to be
settled in the search (those corresponding to values xi = 2). This way, Zt × Z2
2-cocyclic
Hadamard matrices have been found up to t ≤ 31, as Table 2 shows.

tative cocycles βi, so that B = {∂2, . . . , ∂4t−2, β1, β2, β3}. In the sequel we assume t > 2.

Therefore, in this case, (4) is rewritten as

for all i ∈ {1, . . . , 4t − 3}.

According to ´Alvarez et al. (2008), the last 3t equations in the system (3) are super-
ﬂuous for D4t-cocyclic Hadamard matrices. So, we have only t − 1 polynomials of the
form Sl = sl,1 + . . . + sl,4t. Before computing the monomials sl,h, we state the following
lemma, which follows straightforwardly by inspection.

Lemma 6. The two generalized coboundary matrices with entries −1 in a position
(s, c) ∈ {2, . . . , t} × {1, . . . , 4t} are M ∂c and M ∂j(s,c) , where

Taking into account this lemma and the basis of cocycles B, we compute the monomials

sl,h := rl+1,h (1 − 2xh−1)χB(h) (1 − 2xj(l+1,h)−1)χB(j(l+1,h)),

for 1 ≤ l ≤ t − 1 and 1 ≤ h ≤ 4t. Similarly to Theorem 1, the next result holds.

D4t

We have implemented this method as a Singular procedure called CocDH(t, opt, H).
Once again, the parameter opt indicates whether to compute the cardinality or the full
set Hρ
of D4t-cocyclic matrices. And the auxiliary parameter H = (x2, . . . , x4t−2) once
again determines which coboundaries are ﬁxed (xi = 1 means ∂i is used, whereas xi = 0
implies ∂i is not used), and which of them are unknowns to be settled in the search (those
corresponding to values xi = 2). Similarly to the Zt × Z2
2 case, an initial distribution of
the coboundaries is ﬁxed by considering the tuple dist = (d1, . . . , dt) such that

d1 := x1 + x2t−2 + x2t+1,
di := xi + x2t−i+1 + x2t+i + x4t−i−1, for all i ∈ {2, . . . , t − 1},
dt := x2t−1 + x2t.

4. Conclusions

By means of distinct techniques in algebraic geometry, this paper has been concerned
with the computation of cocyclic Hadamard matrices over a ﬁxed group G of order 4t, as
the aﬃne varieties of certain non-zero dimensional radical ideals. All the procedures that
are described in the paper have been implemented in the open computer algebra system

12

for polynomial computations Singular and are included in the library hadamard.lib,
which is available online at http://personales.us.es/raufalgan/LS/hadamard.lib.

Based on the classic cocyclic test of Horadam and de Launey (1995), our ﬁrst approach
(Theorem 1), has excessive complexity even for very small t. In order to improve the
eﬃciency of this polynomial method, we have used recent results on the inner structure
of a cocyclic matrix and we have deﬁned a diﬀerent ideal that also characterizes the
set of G-cocyclic Hadamard matrices (Theorem 3). Improved versions of this procedure
(CocAH(t, col, dist, H) and CocDH(t, opt, H), based on Theorems 5 and 7, respectively)
have been used to perform local searches for Zt×Z2
2-cocyclic Hadamard matrices and D4t-
cocyclic Hadamard matrices, so that matrices of order up to 4t ≤ 124 have been found.
To this end, an auxiliary data H is needed to perform these local searches, for t ≥ 11 (an
exhaustive search is only feasible for t < 11). More concretely, the list H indicates which
coboundaries are ﬁxed (either used or not), and which of them are considered unknowns
to be settled. A very interesting future work is trying to characterize if there exist some
typo structures for H such that the existence of cocyclic Hadamard matrices over either
Zt × Z2

2 or D4t is predicted.
