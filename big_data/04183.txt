ABSTRACT

In this work we study the distribution of temporal power-law decay indices, α, in the Gamma Ray
Burst (GRB) afterglow phase, ﬁtted for 176 GRBs (139 long GRBs, 12 short GRBs with extended
emission and 25 X-Ray Flashes (XRFs)) with known redshifts. These indices are compared to the
values of characteristic afterglow luminosity, La, the time, T ∗
a , and the decay index, αW , derived with
global light curve ﬁtting using the Willingale et al.
(2007) model. This model ﬁtting yields similar
distributions of αW to the ﬁtted α, but for individual bursts a diﬀerence can be signiﬁcant. Analysis
of the (α, La) distribution reveals only a weak correlation of these quantities. However, we discovered
a signiﬁcant regular trend when studying GRB α values along the La versus T ∗
a (LT) distribution,
with systematic variation of α parameter distribution with luminosity for any selected T ∗
a . We analyze
this systematics with respect to the ﬁtted LT correlation line (Dainotti et al. 2008). Study of the
presented trend may allow one for constraining the physical models for GRBs. We also attempted to
use the derived correlation of α(T ∗
a ) to diminish the luminosity scatter related to the
variations of α along the LT distribution, a step in searching a standardizing procedure for GRBs. A
proposed toy model accounting for this systematics applied to the analyzed GRB distribution results
in a slight increase of the LT correlation coeﬃcient.

INTRODUCTION

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) with their powerful emis-
sion processes are observed up to high redshifts z > 9
(Cucchiara et al. 2011). A signiﬁcant progress in study-
ing the phenomenon resulted from GRB observations by
the Swift satellite (http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/), reveal-
ing complex behaviors of their X-ray light curves. There
are several emission models proposed in the literature
providing predictions for characteristic GRB light curve
features. Well known is the model of Meszaros
(1998,
2006), with the jet internal shocks generating the GRB
prompt phase emission, while an external shock of the
GRB expanding ﬁreball generating the afterglow emis-
sion.

2008), updated in Dainotti et al.

In the present paper we study distributions of the GRB
afterglow parameters versus light curve decay indices α,
for the power-law decay observed in the afterglow phase,
with the X-ray luminosity La ∝ t−α. We analyze an
extended sample of 176 GRBs with known redshifts ob-
served by Swift from 2005 to 2014. In the presented anal-
ysis we use the luminosity-time correlation (Dainotti et
al.
(2010, 2011a,
2013a, 2015a), between the derived characteristic after-
glow plateau luminosity, La, and time, T ∗
a (an index *
indicates the GRB rest frame quantity), derived in such
modeling. The values of La and T ∗
a are taken below as a
reference to the separately ﬁtted α values. An additional
attempt to study the GRB afterglow properties was pre-
sented by Gendre et al.
(2008). They analyzed the
“late” light curve properties at the time of 1 day after
the burst to reveal existence of grouping the GRB lu-
minosities into two groups diﬀering also in their redshift

distributions. In their study they noted relations of some
GRB parameters, in particular a non-trivial distribution
of X-ray spectral indices versus the light curve time decay
indices, but no dependence of these indices on the GRB

have been studied by Dainotti et al.
(2011b, 2015b),
Margutti et al. (2013) and Grupe et al. (2013). The im-
portance of this study results also from the fact that the
afterglow luminosity-time correlation has already been
the object of theoretical modeling either via accretion
(Kumar et al. 2008; Lindner et al. 2010; Cannizzo &
Gehrels 2009; Cannizzo et al.
2011), via a magnetar
model (Yamazaki 2009; Dall’Osso et al. 2011; Bernar-
dini et al. 2011; Rowlinson & O’Brien 2012; Rowlinson
et al. 2013, 2014; Rea et al. 2015) or energy injection
(Sultana et al. 2013; Leventis et al. 2014; van Eerten
2014a,b) and there were attempts to apply it as a cos-
mological tool (Cardone et al.
2009, 2010; Dainotti et
al.
2014). Here we intend to
extend observational basis for understanding GRB after-
glows and occurrence of their plateau phase looking into
its possible dependence on additional physical parame-
ters characterizing the afterglow light curve.

2013b; Postnikov et al.

Below, in Section 2 we introduce the data set analyzed
in this study.
In Section 3 we describe the performed
observational data analysis and the derived distributions
of light curve decay indices α. The analysis reveals a
weak correlation for α and La, but a signiﬁcant system-
atic trend along the correlated (La, T ∗
a ) distribution. In
Section 4 we shortly consider physical interpretation of
the α distribution. Then, in Section 5 we preliminary
explore a new possibility toward the GRB usage as cos-
mological standard candles, illustrated with a proposed
toy model scaling GRB afterglow luminosity toward the
one for the selected standard α0. We complete the paper
with conclusions and ﬁnal discussion in Section 6.

The ﬁtted slopes and normalization parameters of the
correlations presented in this paper are derived using
the D’Agostini (2005) method. The ΛCDM cosmology
considered here is given by H0 = 71 km s−1 M pc−1,
ΩΛ = 0.73 and ΩM = 0.27 .

2. DATA SAMPLE

Below we analyze distribution of afterglow light curve
decay indices, α, for the data set of 176 GRBs with
known redshifts, observed by Swift from January 2005
to July 2014. Within this sample we consider sepa-
rately subsamples of 139 long GRBs, 25 X-Ray Flashes
(XRFs)1, 12 short GRBs with extended emission and
164 long GRBs and XRFs considered together as a sin-
gle sample.

As described in Dainotti et al.

(2013a) all analyzed
GRB light curves were ﬁtted using an analytic functional
form proposed by Willingale et al.
(2007). The consid-
ered sample was chosen from all Swift GRBs with known
redshifts by selecting only these events which allowed for
the considered afterglow ﬁtting. The ﬁts provided phys-
including its
ical parameters for the GRB afterglows,
characteristic luminosity and time, La and T ∗
a , in the end
of the afterglow plateau phase, and the power-law decay
index, αW , for the afterglow decaying phase2. The ﬁtted
decay indices αW are inﬂuenced by the requirement of
the best global light curve ﬁtting of the postulated ana-
lytic model. Therefore, we decided to apply a diﬀerent
procedure for derivation of the decay index α to be used
in the following analysis, intended to provide a precise ﬁt
of the light curve power-law decay part only soon after
the plateau. In each GRB we selected the afterglow light
curve section with a power-law form and we performed
the χ2 ﬁtting of α in such range, as presented in the
ON LINE MATERIAL including the set of ﬁgures for all
GRBs showing performed ﬁts and providing the ﬁtting
parameters in the table. We compared these parameters
with those by Evans et al.
(2009) and their automatic
update from Swift, having nearly the same α values in
majority of cases, but also signiﬁcant diﬀerences in in-
dividual cases due to diﬀerent selected time ranges for
ﬁtting.

The applied procedure allowed one to remove all clear
deviations of the power-law form from the ﬁtting due to
ﬂares and non-uniformities in the observational data. In
the case of noting a break in the decaying part of the
light curve, a value of α was ﬁtted to the brighter/earlier
part of the light curve. We have to note that in some rare
cases it was impossible to decide if the ﬁrst part of the
light curve can be considered the decaying part, or still
a steep plateau phase, and the presented ﬁts can be dis-
puted. We decided to use all derived data in the analysis
and correlations studied in this paper leaving possibility
of some particular data selection and/or rejecting some
events from the analysis to the future study.

Comparing of the distributions of α and αW on Fig.
1 shows that both measured decay indices have simi-

but with a spectral peak energy one order of magnitude smaller
than in the long GRBs and with ﬂuence greater in the X-rays than
in the gamma ray band. Sometimes XRFs are considered to be
misaligned long GRBs (Ioka & Nakamura 2001; Yamazaki et al.
2002) and it is why we also analyze both these samples together.

lar distributions, but diﬀerences for individual ﬁtted val-
ues can be signiﬁcant. The parameters of the Gaussian
ﬁts for both presented distributions are: a mean value
µ (α) = 1.40 with standard deviation σ (α) = 0.46 for
our power-law ﬁtting as compared to µ (αW ) = 1.45 and
σ (αW ) = 0.45 for the Willingale model ﬁtting. The P-
value of the T-test between these two distributions is 0.89
indicating no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
the two distributions.

3. ANALYSIS OF THE AFTERGLOW DECAY LIGHT

CURVES

Using the analyzed subsample of long GRBs+XRFs
one can look for any systematic trend in the (log La,
α) distribution. As presented at Fig. 2 there is indica-
tion that these both quantities are (weakly) correlated.
However, scatter of points around the correlation line is
substantial and the derived Spearman (Spearman 1904)
correlation coeﬃcient ρ = 0.17 is small. The ﬁtted cor-
relation line is log La = 0.30 α + 47.20, showing that on
average faster light curve decay seems to occur for GRBs
with higher luminosities. However, let us stress again,
the trend is weak in this highly scattered distribution.
The same analysis using the long GRBs subsample only
leads to a slightly weaker correlation with ρ = 0.14 and
P = 10−4.

Fig. 4.— GRB distributions functions versus α for analyzed sub-
samples in 3 considered luminosity ranges:
log La < 47.25 (red),
47.25 < log La < 48.2 (green) and La > 48.2 (blue). In each ∆α
bin the data for diﬀerent luminosity ranges are plotted as (shifted
within the considered bin) separate color bars.

ing the same systematics for all analyzed GRB samples
with lower luminosity events showing tendency for slower
light curve decay. The fact that blue lines for brightest
GRBs seem to grow faster to unity results from appar-
ently smaller α scatter in this luminosity range. It is also
conﬁrmed by the performed evaluation of lowest (red)
and highest (blue) luminosity distributions along the α
coordinate for the GRB subsamples (Fig. 4), using the
statistical Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. It shows that
it is highly unlikely (P = 0.01) that both distributions
are drawn randomly from the same population. As re-
gards the XRFs and short GRBs subsamples the avail-
able numbers of elements are too low for establishing re-
liable statistical results, however the distributions seem
to show the same tendency with the bright GRBs shifted
to the right with respect to the dimmer ones.

There is no well understood universal recipe yet for dif-
ferentiating the GRB source physical properties from ob-
servational data, but the existence of log La versus log T ∗
a
correlation (“LT correlation”, Dainotti et al.
(2008,
2010)) reﬂects the presence of ∼ uniformly varying prop-
erties of GRB progenitor with the extent of the plateau
phase.
If these properties would be the GRB progeni-
tor mass and/or its angular momentum, then one could
expect diﬀerent external medium proﬁles around the ex-
ploding massive star, where the afterglow related shock
propagates. Therefore, one may expect to detect more
clear dependence between the afterglow luminosity and
the α index for GRBs analyzed within a limited range of
T ∗
a . In fact such systematic trend becomes clearly visible
in varying distribution of α values with GRB luminosity
along the (log La, log T ∗
a ) distribution presented in Fig.
5.

In analogy to the above analysis with selected lumi-
nosity subsamples, let us study relative distributions of
GRB subsamples in three ranges of the decay index: the
“slowly” decaying light curves with 0.53 < α < 1.23, the
“intermediate” ones with 1.23 < α < 1.54 and the “fast”
decaying light curves with 1.54 < α < 3.41. With such
selection each subsample has the same (±1) number of
GRBs.

In the attempt to evaluate if the trend at Fig. 2 could
be real we decided to compare distributions of α plotted
for three luminosity ranges with equal numbers of GRBs:
a low energy range – log La < 47.25, a medium luminos-
ity range – 47.25 < log La < 48.2 , and high luminosity
range – La > 48.2. Normalized cumulative distributions

Fig. 3 we present these functions in 3 analyzed luminos-
ity ranges for the whole GRBs sample, long GRBs, and
short GRBs and XRFs.

these distributions. This behaviour is also well visible
in the normalized cumulative distributions plotted at
Fig. 6 for the selected subsamples with respect to the
ratio of the GRB afterglow luminosity La(T ∗
a ) to the
respective luminosity LLT (T ∗
a ) at the ﬁtted correlation
line:
in the logarithmic scale log(La/LLT ) = log La -
log LLT . A signiﬁcant trend between the relative lumi-
nosity log(La/LLT ) and α is visible at Fig. 7, leading,
e.g. to negligible KS probability P = 1.4× 10−6 that the
low and high α subsamples are randomly drawn from a
single GRB population.
8 we present a distribution of log(La) −
log(LLT ) versus the α index for the long GRBs+XRFs
subsample. A linear correlation ﬁtted for this distribu-
tion is

On Fig.

log La − log LLT = 0.49+0.17−0.17 α − 0.70+0.25−0.25

.

(1)

Here, for the observed tendency of having steeper light
curve decay for higher – with respect to the LT corre-
lation line – afterglow luminosity, the correlation coeﬃ-
cient is ρ = 0.36, and the correlation is highly signiﬁcant
with a probability for random occurrence of P = 10−10.
Using the long GRBs subsample only the correlation
has a slightly smaller slope (0.42) with ρ = 0.36 and
P = 7.7 × 10−10.

Because of often signiﬁcant ﬁtting errors of parame-
ters of the analyzed GRB sample we decided to perform
an additional statistical analysis using the Monte Carlo
modeling of the data. For each GRB we consider parame-
ters La, T ∗
a , and α to have Gaussian distributions around
the ﬁtted value, with the distribution width given by the
respective quantity error. Then, with selecting for all
considered GRBs the random values from such distribu-
tions we analyzed such randomly created data samples by
ﬁtting the LT correlation to each one and, then, deriving
the correlation coeﬃcient and the correlation slope for
the log(La/LLT ) vs. α distribution. By repeating such
simulation 3 · 104 times (see Fig. 9, upper panels) we
ﬁnd that within the measurement errors existing corre-
lation should be approximately between 0.2 < ρ < 0.5

sus log(La/LLT ) for the analyzed GRB subsamples in 3 considered

and the ﬁtted log(La/LLT ) vs. α has an inclination
0.3 < a < 0.5, in the lower range of ﬁtted errors in Eq.
(1).

Using similar simulations as above one can also inde-
pendently check possibility of randomly obtaining the
studied log(La/LLT ) vs. α correlation if no systematic
relation of α with respect to La and T ∗
a exists. We
performed such analysis by repeating randomly selected
samples using the procedure above, but with addition-
ally randomly reshuﬄing the α values within the sample
before the ﬁnal distribution analysis. Repeating such
analysis simulation, again, 3 · 104 times, shows that pos-
sibility of obtaining the correlation coeﬃcient found in
the real data is negligible (Fig. 9, lower panels).

4. FINAL DISCUSSION

Analysis of the ﬁtted afterglow power-law decay in-
dices for the subsample of long GRBs+XRFs reveals a
weak trend for having a steeper decay phase for higher
afterglow luminosity La. The trend turns into a signiﬁ-
cant correlation if we consider GRB afterglow luminosity
scaled to the one expected from the ﬁtted LT correlation,
for a given GRB afterglow plateau end time T ∗
a . As dif-
ferent T ∗
a result from varying GRB source properties, the
present analysis can be used to get new insight into phys-
ical nature of GRB sources.

4.1. Theoretical models

One can note attempts in the literature to provide
physical interpretation of logLa versus α relation. Let us
refer to such model presented by Hascoet et al.
(2014)
(see also Genet et al. (2007)) in order to relate the con-
sidered α parameter to the microphysics of the reverse
shock emission. In the model of Hascoet et al. the en-
˙ET , in the GRB afterglow varied
ergy deposition rate,
in time ‘t’ as power-law dependence of the ﬂow Lorentz
gamma factor, Γ(t):

where the energy scale ˙E∗ is determined by the total en-
ergy injected in the afterglow phase; q and q (cid:48) are the
power-law indices for the time dependence of the energy
injection rate. In this model the q parameter constraints
the shape of the plateau phase, while q (cid:48) transports in-
formation about the light curve decay index after the
plateau. The characteristic value of Γ∗ sets the dura-
tion of the plateau. With the assumed power-law radial
distribution of the medium surrounding GRB progenitor
the Lorentz factor evolves as

Γ(t) = Γ∗

,

(3)

where, e.g., γ = 3/8 for a uniform medium and γ = 1/4
for a stellar wind. Hascoet et al. derived the light curve
decay indices before (α1) and after (α2) the break at the
end of the plateau phase as

(cid:26) α1 = γq − 1

α2 = −γq (cid:48) − 1

(4)
so that the ﬂat plateau phase should be present for q ≈
1/γ, i.e. close to q = 8/3 in the uniform medium and
q = 4 in the wind case. In the presented example Hascoet
et al. (2014) considered the decay index α2 = −1.5 after
the plateau, leading to q (cid:48) = 1/(2γ) and the parameters of
the central engine energy deposition in the late afterglow
stage q (cid:48) = 4/3 and 2 for the uniform medium and the
wind cases, respectively. One may note that this example
uses the α2 value very close to the mean value for our
distribution αmean = 1.4 ± 0.3, as visible in the upper
panel of Fig. 1.

Let us make a note here that the observed large scatter
in the α distribution seems to be diﬃcult to be explained

log(La/LLT ), using the long

(lower panels). With red arrows we indicated values obtained in

by variations of only the source radial density proﬁle,
inﬂuencing the shock propagation. Therefore we consider
the present discussion only as an example for the studies
based on the α parameter measurements.

4.2. GRB standardization

As the second aspect of the present study let us con-
sider possible usage of the measured afterglow light
curve inclination for physical diﬀerentiating the observed
GRBs, which could be used to standardize GRBs us-
ing α as standardization parameter. E.g., the revealed
log(La/LLT ) versus α correlation can be used to search
for the procedure which could enable standardization of
GRBs using all available observational parameters, even-
tually to reveal a new cosmological standard candle. As
an illustrative toy model for such approach we introduce
a procedure for GRBs resembling the one used for stan-
dardization of SN Ia light curves by using the so called
Phillips relation between the peak magnitude and the
“stretching parameter” (Phillips 1993). In attempt to
scale GRBs with diﬀerent decay indices α to the stan-
dard source properties let us arbitrary deﬁne the stan-
dard GRB as the one characterized with the value of the
decay index α0 = 1.4, approximately the mean value for
the distribution presented on Fig. 1. Further, let us pos-

tulate that the expected ‘standardized’ GRB luminosity,
La,0, can be derived using its measured decay index α
and by scaling it to α0 using Eq. 1:

log La,0 = log La + 0.49 (α0 − α)

.

(5)

This procedure applied for all events in the analyzed sub-
sample of long GRBs+XRFs results in only slight in-
crease of the LT correlation coeﬃcient absolute value,
from ρ = −0.72 for the original (log La, log T ∗
a ) data
to ρ0 = −0.76 for the modiﬁed distribution (log La,0,
log T ∗
a ). When using the long GRBs subsample only
the increase in the correlation coeﬃcient is even smaller.
This increase of the correlation coeﬃcient is obtained
with the ﬁts for quite diﬀerent shapes of the afterglow
light curves and thus diﬀerent quality of available GRB
parameters La, T ∗
a and α. More detailed analysis of this
standardization procedure, with careful consideration of
the afterglow light curves for the selected events, is in
progress now.
