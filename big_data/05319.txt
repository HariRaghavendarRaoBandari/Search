Abstract

In this study, we analyse a high-frequency movement dataset for a group of graz-

ing cattle and investigate their spatiotemporal patterns using a simple two-state

‘stop-and-move’ mobility model. We ﬁnd that the dispersal kernel in the moving

state is best described by a mixture exponential distribution, indicating the hier-

archical nature of the movement. On the other hand, the waiting time appears

to be scale-invariant below a certain cut-oﬀ and is best described by a truncated

power-law distribution, suggesting heterogenous dynamics in the non-moving state.

We explore possible explanations for the observed phenomena, covering factors that

can play a role in the generation of mobility patterns, such as the context of graz-

ing environment, the intrinsic decision-making mechanism or the energy status of

diﬀerent activities. In particular, we propose a new hypothesis that the underlying

movement pattern can be attributed to the most probable observable energy status

under the maximum entropy conﬁguration. These results are not only valuable

for modelling cattle movement but also provide new insights for understanding the

underlying biological basis of grazing behaviour.

Introduction

Animal movement is a highly complex process driven by various random and deterministic

mechanisms involving a large number of causing factors [1, 2].

It has been proposed

that spatiotemporal patterns in movement may arise from moving strategies that evolve

to optimise foraging eﬃciency [3, 4], decision-making processes in response to external

stimuli [5], environmental conditions or landscape features [6, 7, 8], collective dynamics

and social interactions [9, 10], memory and home-return behaviour [11], just to name

a few. Fully unravelling the complexity of animal movement as well as sorting out the

intricate relations between the observed spatiotemporal pattern and various underlying

causing factors remains a diﬃcult scientiﬁc challenge.

For over a century, our attempts to understand animal movement have been limited

to a qualitative level due to the lack of high-quality data that can provide ﬁne-grained

spatiotemporal description of movement [2]. Recently, new tracking technologies such as

the Global Positioning System (GPS) have been deployed in animal tracking to obtain

continuous time-resolved moving trajectories with high spatiotemporal resolution. The

emerging high-quality movement data enables the application of quantitative analysis and

mathematical characterisation on mobility patterns at diﬀerent spatiotemporal scales.

One common approach to analyse animal movement is to represent the time-resolved

trajectory as discrete moving steps under the framework of random walk [12, 13, 14].

In this context, the dispersal kernel p(r) in space, which characterises the general dis-

tribution of step length r in the trajectory, is considered to be a signiﬁcant footprint of

movement [15, 16]. The detailed functional form of p(r) is indicative of a speciﬁc type

of random walk and the underlying dynamics of movement. For example, an exponential

kernel function p(r) ∼ e−r/rc with rc being the characteristic length scale is the signa-

ture of the classic Brownian walk that obeys the central-limit theorem and exhibits a

normal-diﬀusive pattern. A scaling dispersal kernel characterised by a power-law func-

tion p(r) ∼ r−γ with γ being the scaling exponent is the signature of the L´evy walk which

exhibits high heterogeneity and super-diﬀusive pattern. Much eﬀort has been devoted

to study the dispersal kernel p(r) for diﬀerent animal species using real movement data,

from small insects like honey bees [17], marine life like jelly ﬁsh and whales [18], birds like

albatross [19, 20], to mammals like monkeys [21] and human [16, 22, 23]. One controver-

sial topic that attracts tremendous attention in this line is about whether the observed

2

movement follows a Brownian-like motion or a L´evy walk. Although many studies have

suggested strong evidence for the existence of L´evy walks in animals, it has been argued

that this evidence may come from statistical artefacts or inappropriate manipulation of

data [24, 25, 26]. Indeed, the dispersal kernel p(r) only provides partial information on

the spatial pattern and does not fully capture all important movement aspects such as

the temporal spectrum that depicts the switch among diﬀerent activity modes over time.

Recently it has been found that scaling phenomena in movement can also arise in the

waiting time distribution p(τw) that characterises the time span of non-moving period, or

the inter-event time distribution p(τe) that characterises the time between two successive

moving activities [16, 11, 27]. These ﬁndings suggest there is a need for more detailed

investigation on the spatiotemporal pattern in movement beyond the dispersal kernel.

Here we use a dataset of high-frequency GPS samples to study the movement of

grazing cattle. The continuous time-resolved trajectories allow us to gain comprehensive

insight into the spatiotemporal pattern. We use a two-state ‘stop-and-move’ model to

describe the mobility pattern, dividing the trajectory into alternate moving and non-

moving states (see Material and Methods). Speciﬁcally, the non-moving state indicates

that the animal remains within a radius ∆r in space for at least ∆t in time, where ∆r

represents the spatial resolution limit in the observation and ∆t is a tuning threshold

parameter to specify the minimum time span. The non-moving segment in the trajectory
can be viewed as a single point in space, which we call waiting location, with a length τw ≥
∆t in time, which we call waiting time correspondingly. On the other hand, the moving

state indicates that the animal is in a transition from one waiting location to another,

which can be described as a trip (l, τm) in the trajectory with l being the distance between

the two waiting locations and τm being the time elapse of the trip. The representation of

mobility pattern in this approach is shown in the schematic diagram of Fig. 1.

Under this representation, we observe a very interesting spatiotemporal pattern in

which the two activity states are of unique statistical characterization. In particular, we

ﬁnd that the dispersal kernel or trip length distribution p(l) is best described by a hybrid

exponential distribution, which indicates that the trajectory has a two-level hierarchical

structure in space and each level appears to follow a Brownian walk. This is in contrast

to the widely-observed L´evy walk patterns in other species. Despite the absence of scal-

ing law in the spatial dispersal, we ﬁnd that the waiting distribution p(τw) in the time

3

domain is best described by a truncated power-law. Possible underlying mechanisms and

ecological implications accounting for this phenomena are discussed (see Discussions).

Our results provide new quantitative insights into grazing cattle movement that are lack-

ing in most previous work. Indeed, understanding grazing/foraging animal movements

is not only a critical issue in biological science but also of fundamental importance to

many practical issues such as farm and livestock management [28], the maintenance of

biodiversity in ecosystems [29] and developing better tracking [30] and virtual fencing

technologies [31].

Results

Dispersal kernel in moving state. We ﬁrst turn attention to the spatial dispersal

kernel or the trip length distribution p(l) over the whole population. Obtaining the

functional form of p(l) directly from empirical data requires a binning process, which has

(cid:82)

been known to have statistical distortion for data with a broad distribution [26]. To avoid
the disadvantage of binning, we use the complementary cumulative distribution P (l) ≡
l p(l)dl for statistical analysis. We process the data using three diﬀerent parameter sets
with ∆r = 5m corresponding to the resolution limit of positioning device and ∆t =

1, 2, 3 mins respectively [33]. To describe the dispersal kernel P (l) shown in Fig. 2 a-c,

we consider four commonly-used candidate models [32]: (1) power-law; (2) truncated

power-law with exponential cut-oﬀ; (3) exponential; (4) mixture exponential. Using

the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) to ﬁt the candidate models and the Akaike-

information-criterion (AIC) for model selection [24] (see Supporting Information), we ﬁnd

that the best model to describe P (l) is the mixture exponential

P (l) = qe

−(l−lmin)/l1 + (1 − q)e

−(l−lmin)/l2,

(1)

where l1 and l2 are the characteristic lengths in each mixture component, q is a parameter

specifying the mixture proportion, and lmin = ∆r = 5m is the lower bound in observation.

Another signiﬁcant statistical feature of the moving state is the trip time distribution

p(τm), which is also best described by the mixture exponential model, as shown in Fig. 2

d-f. This is consistent with our expectation that the trip time τm is strongly correlated

with the trip length l.

4

The mixture exponential here indicates that the spatial pattern of grazing cattle is

governed by two diﬀerent Brownian-like dynamics with diﬀerent characteristic scales,

suggesting a hierarchical structure of the movement. If we consider that the landscape is

formed by a number of patchy areas, the ﬁrst exponential distribution will represent the

short-range movement that occurs within a patch, and the second exponential distribu-

tion with a larger characteristic length will represent inter-patch movements. To better

reveal this hierarchy structure in mobility pattern, we perform clustering on the waiting

locations using a density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN which is eﬃcient in discov-

ering signiﬁcant clusters with irregular shape from noisy data points, as shown in Fig. 3.

After grouping the waiting locations into clusters, the trips in the mobility pattern fall

into two categories, intra-cluster trip and inter-cluster trip. We ﬁnd that the trip length

distribution for each of these two types of trips can be well described by a single exponen-

tial distribution, as shown in Fig. 4. It is worth noting that the mixture exponential still

renders the highest AIC weight among the four candidate models for the intra-cluster trip

length distribution, while the single exponential has the highest AIC weight without the

mixture exponential. However the diﬀerence between the two components in the mixture

model is comparably small (l1 = 11.20, l2 = 22.05, q = 0.44, ∆t = 2 mins), suggesting

that the two components are not strongly distinguishable and a single exponential is a

reasonable alternative model in this scenario. We also observe that some long-distance

inter-cluster trips are of high similarity, indicating that transitions from one cluster to

another are not completely random and spontaneous, but could be driven by a determin-

istic process such as memory or herding.

Waiting time distribution. To characterise the waiting time distribution, we com-

pare three diﬀerent models, namely exponential, power-law and truncated power-law

with exponential cut-oﬀ (see Supporting Information). We observe that the waiting-time

distribution p(τw) is best described by a truncated power-law distribution

p(τw) ∼ τ

−τw/τ c

w

−γ
w e

(2)

with γ being the scaling exponent and τ c

w being the structural cut-oﬀ. As shown in Fig. 5,

varying the threshold parameter ∆t in data processing does not aﬀect the emergence of

scaling phenomena. The scaling law in the waiting time distribution is indicative of the

heterogeneous grazing dynamics of cattle, which could be related to the landscape hetero-

5

geneity, the complex decision-making dynamics or the energy management of movement

(See Discussion). We also ﬁnd that the waiting time distributions in the main clusters

discovered by the DBSCAN algorithm are all well described by a truncated power-law,

suggesting the scaling behaviour in waiting time distribution is invariant at the cluster-

level.

Without taking into account correlation between activities, the temporal spectrum

of mobility pattern can be approximated as a two-state renewal process where the time

span of the alternate moving and non-moving activities are randomly drawn from the

distribution functions p(τm) and p(τw) respectively. To test the validity of this approx-

imation, we measure the pairwise Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between the time span

of consecutive activity segments in the following four situations: (1) the non-moving seg-
ment and the next moving segment (r = −0.0344, p = 0.0363); (2) the moving segment
and the next non-moving segment (r = −0.0616, p = 0.000174); (3) two consecutive
non-moving segment (r = 0.0787, p = 1.58 × 10−6); (4) two consecutive moving segment
(r = 0.0719, p = 1.24 × 10−6). We ﬁnd that none of these shows signiﬁcant correlation.

The result suggests that short-range correlation does not exist in the temporal spectrum,

i.e. the time span of the previous activity has little inﬂuence on the time span of the

next activity, and the temporal dynamics can be approximately described by a two-state

renewal process without considering long-range correlation.

Individual mobility pattern. The population-based statistics presented above are not

necessarily representative of the individual patterns. It has been suggested that the char-

acteristics of population statistics may diﬀer from their individual counterpart after being

aggregated over population. For example, the observed L´evy walk pattern in population

may arise from individual heterogeneity [34]. To test whether the individual pattern is

consistent with the population-based statistics, we use the same model selection proce-

dure to ﬁt the individual statistics (∆r = 5m, ∆t = 2 mins). We ﬁnd that the trip length

and trip time distribution for each individual is best described by the hybrid exponential,

with only one exception in the trip length distribution. On the other hand, the waiting

distribution for each individual is best described by power-law or truncated power-law

(see Supporting Information). This suggests that the composite Brownian walk in space

as well as the scaling law in waiting time distribution are not an statistical artefact due

6

to the mixture of diﬀerent individual patterns, but they appear to be universal for all

individuals. Although all individual spatiotemporal patterns are best described by the

same distribution functions, the ﬁtted parameters vary from individual to individual. For

example, the exponents of the truncated power-law for waiting distribution estimated by

the maximum-likelihood method range from γ = 1.6 to γ = 2.5. This indicates that the

internal properties encapsulated by the scaling exponent γ are diﬀerent among individual

cows, although their activities appear to be governed by the same dynamics.

Discussion

In this study we have found that under a two-state ‘stop-and-move’ representation the

spatiotemporal pattern of grazing cattle exhibits a hierarchical structure in space and an

asymmetric temporal spectrum, which can be described by a composite Brownian walk

interspersed with power-law distributed non-moving periods. This ﬁnding is in contrast

to the patterns observed in human [27] and T-cell [35] mobility where the moving and

non-moving states are both characterised by a scaling law. Since detailed statistical

characterisation on free-range animal movement based on high-frequency GPS trajectories

is still largely missing, this ﬁnding can provide new perspectives to our understanding for

grazing animals movement and useful leads to the underlying ecological basis of grazing

behaviour.

A simple deterministic scenario that can give rise to the observed scaling law in

waiting time distribution is that the environment is structured according to the same

heterogenous statistics. We can consider that diﬀerent location (cid:126)r in the landscape is of

diﬀerent quality or resource abundance described a quality function Q((cid:126)r). If the cattle

simply spend their time for feeding on one location proportional to the quality Q((cid:126)r) at

that location, i.e. a ‘greedy’ strategy, Q((cid:126)r) would be the observed waiting distribution.

Stochastic processes and spontaneous behaviour can also account for the observed

spatiotemporal pattern. Recently, a plausible decision-based queueing process in which

the animal executes activities from a stochastic priority list has been used to interpret

the scaling law observed in the waiting time of marine predators [18]. This model was

originally proposed to explain the power-law distributed inter-event time observed in the

7

communication pattern in human dynamics [22]. Speciﬁcally, the model assumes that the
animal performs the two activities waiting and moving with probability x1 and x2 = 1−x1
at a regular basis, where x1 and x2 are the priority of the activity drawn from a random

distribution p(x). If the animal moves, it changes its context and therefore its likelihood

to move or stay also changes. As a result, the priority will be redrawn from the random

distribution, representing the change of state due to the movement. This model can

generate the power-law distribution in waiting time as well as the exponential distribution

in step-size. By introducing a deterministic component to the decision probability, the

model can be also tuned to generate diﬀerent scaling exponent γ accounting for the various

scaling phenomena in diﬀerent species. The model is recast in a dynamic prey-predator

environment where the moving probability x1 can be interpreted as the likelihood of

ﬁnding a prey in the vicinity.

We can also consider the movement as a two-state point process, in which the prob-

abilities that the animal switches its state are qA (from moving to non-moving) and qB

(from non-moving to moving) [38, 39]. It is well known that the state duration is exponen-

tial distributed when the switching probability is constant and independent of time [39].

Recently, it has been suggested that the power-law distributed duration can be attributed

to the reinforcement dynamics, such that the switching probability is proportional to the

time that animal has spend in its current state, i.e. the longer the animal stays in its

current state the less likely it will change it [36, 37, 38].

Another explanation is to associate the movement pattern with the energy state of

the animal using a maximum entropy approach. In this context, each moving and non-

moving activity is associated with a certain amount of energy loss El or energy gain

Eg. According to the maximum entropy principle, the distribution of El and Eg over all

activity segments should follow a Boltzmann distribution p(El,g) ∼ e−El,g (See Material

and methods). The validation of the maximum entropy approach is mainly subject to two

conditions: (1) each individual activity is independent and has no inﬂuence on others;

and (2) the energy intake and expenditure is maintained by two diﬀerent mechanisms and

can be treated as two isolated systems. The ﬁrst condition is supported by our test on the

correlation between consecutive activities, while the second is intuitively understandable.
Following this formulation, it is straightforward to derive that when Eg ∝ log τw and
El ∝ τm the observed scaling law in waiting time as well as the exponential distribution

8

in trip time can be reproduced. That is to say, the energy intake increases logarithmically

as grazing time increases, while the energy expenditure due to moving increases linearly

with the moving time or distance. It is interesting to note that the logarithmic energy

intake function has been suggested for grazing animals before, and the linear energy

expenditure or cost function has been widely observed in many single-mode movements

of human transportation activities [41, 40]. It is well known that energy status can aﬀect

animal movement, but a quantitative understanding of their relation is still unclear.

Our proposed maximum entropy approach can potentially ﬁll this gap by establishing a

connection between the energy function and the observed mobility pattern, suggesting

that the detailed energy intake or expenditure as a function of time in diﬀerent activities

can be inferred from statistical features of the macroscopic mobility patterns such as

waiting time or step-length distributions. The conjectured relation can be tested in

future experiments by measuring detailed energy intake or consumption using laboratory

techniques.

Material and methods

Dataset description. The dataset consists of continuous 0.5-Hz GPS samples for 34

individuals covering an observation period of over 50 hours. We select the data of 31 in-

dividuals in which there is no discontinuity in GPS samples and we choose a continuous

30-hour observation window during which the animals were grazing in a conﬁned 600m
× 400m rectangular area. The trajectory for each individual cow can be denoted by a
sequence L = {pi}, where pi = (xi, yi, ti) represents a GPS sample with (xi, yi) being
the position coordinates and ti being the timestamp. We use moving average ﬁltering

to reduce the noise and smooth the trajectory with a 10 sec moving window, such that
pi = (cid:104)pi−2, pi−1, pi, pi+1, pi+2(cid:105).

Classiﬁcation of mobility pattern. We deﬁne the non-moving segment of a trajectory
as a set of consecutive points Lw = {pk, pk+1, . . . , pk+m−1}, which satisﬁes the following
three conditions: (1) the distance dk,j from the starting point pk to any other point pj
of the segment must be smaller than a certain threshold ∆d, i.e. maxk<j<k+m dk,j ≤ ∆r;
(2) the distance from the starting point pk to the point following the ending point of the

9

segment pk+m must be larger than ∆r, i.e. dk,k+m > ∆r; (3) the time span of the seg-
ment must be longer than a certain threshold ∆t, i.e. tk+m − tk > ∆t. In this deﬁnition,
the ﬁrst two constraints are made to identify consecutive points that are likely to rep-

resent an identical position within in a certain proximity. The third constraint imposes

a minimum time span of the non-moving segment that can be tuned to exclude some

very-short random activities such as a pause when encountering an obstacle, as well as

making the extracted non-moving segments more representative of meaningful activities

such as grazing or resting. After extracting the non-moving segments, we simply deﬁne

the points between two non-moving segments as the moving segments. The approach

here is in analogy to the deﬁnition of staying points for continuous GPS samples in most

spatiotemporal analysis of human mobility [27, 42]. The value of ∆t is suggested to be
2 − 3 mins [33].

Maximum entropy principle. The maximum entropy principle originates from statis-

tical mechanics, which assumes that the conﬁguration of microscopic states of a complex

system (e.g. the energy of each particle) leading to the macroscopic observation is the

one that maximise the entropy of the system. Suppose the system consists of N non-

interacting particles and has a total energy U , such that N = (cid:80) ni and U = (cid:80) niEi

where ni denotes the number of particles at a speciﬁc energy state Ei. Then the en-

semble that represents all possible conﬁgurations of the system is called the canonical

ensemble, and the probability p(E) that a particle has a speciﬁc energy state E is de-

noted by P (E) ∝ e−E/ ¯E. Here we assume that the alternate moving and non-moving

activities in the mobility pattern operate in two independent systems, while the individ-

ual activities are regarded as ‘particles’ and the associated energy state of the activity is

the incurred energy gain (or loss) due to the activity. To obtain the distribution of the
time span τ in each activity, we use the transformation p(τ ) = p(E) dE(τ )

dτ where E(τ ) is
the energy function that describes the energy gain as a function of the time span dur-

ing the activity. The detailed form of the distribution function p(τ ) is then subject to
the energy function E(τ ). For example, a logarithmic function E(τ ) ∝ log τ will lead
to a power-law distribution p(τ ) ∝ τ β, while a linear function will simply maintain a
exponential form p(τ ) ∝ e−kτ .

Figure 1: A schematic diagram of the spatiotemporal pattern under the two-state ‘stop-

and-move’ representation. (a) The temporal spectrum of activities illustrated in a spike

train. Colour segments on the time-axis represent alternating waiting (white) and moving

(red) activities over time. (b) The raw trajectory of an individual cow before processing.

(c) The spatial pattern extracted from the raw trajectory in panel (b) can be projected as

a transition graph, where the waiting locations for non-moving segments are represented

by red dots and the trips are represented by blue solid lines.
