ABSTRACT

The reﬂection spectrum of the torus around AGN is characterized by X-ray ﬂuorescent
lines, which are most prominent for type II AGN. A clumpy torus allows photons reﬂected
from the back-side of the torus to leak through the front free-of-obscuration regions. There-
fore, the observed X-ray ﬂuorescent lines are sensitive to the clumpiness of the torus. We
analyse a sample of type II AGN observed with Chandra HETGS, and measure the ﬂuxes
for the Si Kα and Fe Kα lines. The measured Fe Kα/Si Kα ratios, spanning a range between
5 −60, are far smaller than the ratios predicted from simulations of smooth tori, indicating that
the tori of the studied sources have clumpy distributions rather than smooth ones. Compared
with simulation results of clumpy tori with a half-opening angle of 60◦, the Circinus galaxy
has a Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio of ∼ 60, which is close to the simulation results for N = 5, where
N is the average number of clumps along the line of sight. The Fe Kα/Si Kα ratios of the
other sources are all below the simulation results for N = 2. Overall, it shows that the non-Fe
ﬂuorescent lines in the soft X-ray band are a potentially powerful probe of the clumpiness of
the torus around AGN.

1 INTRODUCTION

to unifying diﬀerent

The obscuring torus around active galactic nucleus (AGN)
is the key ingredient
types of AGN
(e.g. Antonucci 1993). The distribution of matter in the torus
was considered to be clumpy in early theoretical
studies
(Krolik & Begelman 1988). This implies that the classiﬁcation of
AGN is a probability of direct view of AGN (Elitzur 2008). The
dust in the torus absorbs the radiation from the central AGN and
re-radiates it in the infrared. While the simpliﬁed smooth model of
torus was studied from early on, many detailed infrared observa-
tions point to clumpy distributions (see H¨onig 2013; Netzer 2015,
for recent reviews).

The clumpy nature of the torus is also supported by X-ray ab-
sorption variations on timescales from days to years. Diﬀerent from
dust emission in the infrared, obscuration of X-ray photons can be
produced by dust-free gas within the sublimation radius. An ex-
treme example is NGC 1365, which shows an occultation of the
central AGN within 2 days, indicating that the obscuring clouds are
located at similar distances to those of the broad line region (BLR,
Risaliti et al. 2007) . Statistical study of eclipse events in the RXTE

(2014) showed that most of the clouds are located in the outer
portion of the BLR. Recent hard X-ray monitoring of NGC 1068
by NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array) reveals ﬂux
variations above 20 keV, which imply a transition of the column
density from 1025 cm−2 to 6.7 × 1024 cm−2 (Marinucci et al. 2016).
There seems to be a continuous distribution of clouds from the BLR
to the parsec-scale torus (e.g. Bianchi et al. 2012; Netzer 2015).

X-ray spectra of type II AGN with column densities larger
than 1023 cm−2 are particularly suitable for the study of the torus,
since their intrinsic continua are heavily obscured in the soft X-ray
band. This is especially true for Compton-thick AGN (with col-
umn densities > 1.2 × 1024 cm−2), the intrinsic continua of which
are heavily suppressed below 10 keV, and the observed spectra are
dominated by reﬂection emission from the torus (e.g. Comastri
2004). A characteristic feature of the reﬂection spectrum is the
prominent Fe Kα emission line at 6.4 keV, which generally has
an equivalent width (EW) ∼ 1 keV for Compton-thick AGN (e.g.
Levenson et al. 2002).

A general feature of a clumpy torus is that soft X-ray photons,
reﬂected from the back-side of the torus, are not signiﬁcantly re-
duced due to their passage through the front free-of-obscuration
regions between clumps (Nandra & Geoge 1994; Yaqoob 2012;
Liu & Li 2014). As shown by recent simulations, a clumpy torus
provides signiﬁcantly more soft X-ray photons than a smooth one

column density of torus in recent literature. For NGC 2992, the Fe Kα line of the Chandra HEG spectrum has an EW ∼ 0.4 keV, which can be ﬁtted with the
scattered spectrum of the MYTorus model with a column density ∼ 2 × 1024 cm−2 (Xu et al. in prep).

when viewed edge-on, and the softer the photons, the larger the
diﬀerences (Liu & Li 2014). The reﬂection spectrum can therefore
be used to probe the matter distribution of the torus. For exam-
ple, Bauer et al. (2015) found that a multiple-component reﬂector
is needed to ﬁt the NuSTAR spectra of NGC 1068. Balokovi´c et al.
(2014) found that the NuSTAR spectra of NGC 424, NGC 1320, and
IC 2560 are better ﬁtted with a ”face-on” component of MYTorus
model (Murphy & Yaqoob 2009), which was suggested to mimic
the leakage of soft X-ray photons from a clumpy torus (Yaqoob
2012).

As the soft X-ray spectra of AGN are generally contaminated
by other components, such as emission from photo-ionized gas, it
is hard to measure the pure reﬂected continuum in the soft X-ray
band. Instead, the non-Fe ﬂuorescent lines (e.g. Si Kα line at 1.74
keV) emitted by the torus can be measured unambiguously, since
they are unique line features that can not be confused with other
components. Because the fraction of leaked photons depends on en-
ergy, the ﬂux ratios of the Fe Kα line to non-Fe Kα lines would be a
good probe of the matter distribution of the torus. The non-Fe ﬂuo-
rescent lines are generally weak, due to their small yields and rela-
tively low abundances (e.g. Reynolds et al. 1994; Matt et al. 1997).
Nevertheless, they are still observable, especially for Compton-
thick AGN when the intrinsic continua are heavily suppressed (e.g.
Xu et al. 2016).

In this Letter we compile a sample of type II AGN, ob-
served with Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spec-
trometer (HETGS), to study their non-Fe ﬂuorescent lines, fo-
cusing on the Si Kα line at 1.74 keV, which is generally the
strongest of the non-Fe ﬂuorescent lines. We compare the mea-
sured ﬂux ratios of Fe Kα/Si Kα with simulation results of clump
tori by Liu & Li (2014). The Fe Kα/Ni Kα ratio has been in-
vestigated previously (e.g. Molendi et al. 2003; Matt et al. 2004;
Yaqoob & Murphy 2011). Note that the errors quoted are for the
90% conﬁdence level.

2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA

The Chandra HETGS provides high resolution X-ray spec-
tra for point-like sources (Canizares et al. 2005). It consists of a
High Energy Grating (HEG) with a spectral resolution of 0.012
Å (full width half maximum, FWHM) and a Medium Energy Grat-
ing (MEG) with a resolution of 0.023 Å. The eﬀective area of MEG
is about 3 times larger than that of HEG around 1.74 keV, and drops

quickly above 6 keV. We searched the Chandra HETGS archive for
type II AGN having suﬃcient signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to allow a
reliable measurement of the Si Kα line. We found a total of eight
AGN, which are listed in Table 1. The Si Kα line is also detected in
Cen A, but its dust lane complicates the estimation of the real ﬂux
of the Si Kα line and is therefore not included. Although classi-
ﬁed as Seyfert 1.5, 3C 445 has an X-ray spectrum similar to type II
AGN (e.g. Sambruna et al. 2007; Grandi et al. 2007) and has been
included in the list. The ﬁrst ﬁve sources listed in Table 1 are gen-
erally regarded as Compton-thick AGN, while the others are less
obscured. Many of the selected sources have already been studied
in the literature for their Fe Kα line (e.g. Shu et al. 2011).

We use the data downloaded from Chandra Transmission
Grating Data Archive and Catalog (TGCat, Huenemoerder et al.
2011). All the spectra are extracted from a region with a 2 arcsec
half-width in the cross-dispersion direction, and the ±1 order data
are combined together. The foreground Galactic absorption column
density is 6.2 ×1021 cm−2 and 1 ×1021 cm−2 for Circinus and Mrk 3,
respectively, and is negligible (< 0.7 ×1021 cm−2) for other galaxies
(Kalberla et al. 2005).

3 RESULTS

The Si Kα line (at 1.74 keV) is adjacent to the Mg XII Lyβ line
at 1.745 keV. For Circinus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068, their Chandra
HEG data are deep enough to resolve the peaks of these two lines,
thus allowing the two lines to be measured simultaneously. In par-
ticular, the line width of the Si Kα line can be measured with a
spectral resolution 4 times better than that at 6.4 keV where the Fe
Kα line resides. Measurements of the Si Kα line of Circinus, Mrk
3, and NGC 1068 were presented in Liu (2016). Si Kα line widths
are 3 − 5 times smaller than those measured for the Fe Kα line,
indicating that the line-emitting regions are outside the dust subli-
mation radius. We refer the reader to Liu (2016) for more details
and for convenience, we have listed the relevant results in Table 1.
For all the other sources, the Chandra HEG data are not deep
enough to allow a deblending of the Si Kα line and the Mg XII
Lyβ line. The Chandra HEG spectra of these sources are shown
in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the Si Kα line and the Mg XII Lyβ line
are blended with each other. We ﬁt the data with a model compris-
ing one Gaussian line plus a power-law continuum. To improve the
S/N ratio, the HEG and MEG data are ﬁtted simultaneously. The
ﬁtting region is between 1.4 and 2.3 keV and neglecting the other

main emission features. The ﬁtted results are plotted in Fig. 1 and
listed in Table 1. We see that the one line model is suﬃcient to
ﬁt the data. If we replace the power-law continuum with a thermal
continuum, the ﬁtted intensities of Si Kα line are generally consis-
tent with those of the power-law model, with diﬀerences smaller
than 2%.

The contribution of the Mg XII Lyβ line can be estimated based
on the ﬂuxes of the Mg XII Lyα line at 1.472 keV, which are also
listed in Table 1. For Circinus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068, the ﬂuxes
of the Mg XII Lyβ line can be measured (Liu 2016) and the Mg XII
Lyβ/Mg XII Lyα ratios (corrected for Galactic absorption) are 0.38±
0.11, 0.69 ± 0.33, and 0.19 ± 0.07, respectively. For photo-ionized
plasmas, the emissivity ratio between Mg XII Lyβ and Mg XII Lyα is
around 0.1 − 0.25 (e.g. Kinkhabwala et al. 2003). Considering the
uncertainties in the measurement, the Mg XII Lyβ/Mg XII Lyα ratios
of Circinus and NGC 1068 are consistent with photo-ionization
models. For Mrk 3, the ratio is larger than the predictions of photo-
ionization models. It is likely that the Mg XII Lyβ line is over-
estimated due to blending with the Si Kα line (Liu 2016). Assum-
ing a ratio of Mg XII Lyβ/Mg XII Lyα of 0.2, the contribution of the
Mg XII Lyβ line to the measured ﬂuxes of Si Kα line is about 20%
for all sources.

The ﬂuxes of the Fe Kα line are measured using only the
Chandra HEG data. We also adopt the model of one Gaussian line
plus a power-law continuum. The ﬁtting region is between 5 and 6.8
keV, and the measured ﬂuxes are listed in Table 1. For reference,
the EWs of the samples measured from the ﬁtted models are also
included. The measured EWs are generally larger than 0.3 keV, in-
dicating the reﬂection-dominated nature of the X-ray spectra of the
sample. From the measured ﬂuxes of the Si Kα and Fe Kα line, we
can calculate the Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio after correcting for the contri-
bution of the Mg XII Lyβ line. The results are listed in Table 1. We
see that they span a range between 5 − 60. The Circinus galaxy has

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

the largest Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio around 60, while the ratios of NGC
1068, NGC 3393, and NGC 2992 are as small as ∼ 7.

Liu & Li (2014) simulated the reﬂection spectrum of a torus
with clumpy distributions. The boundaries of the torus are deﬁned
by an inner radius of 0.1 pc, an outer radius of 2 pc, and a half-
opening angle of 60◦. This corresponds to a covering factor of 0.5
for a smooth torus. The clumpiness of the torus is described by
the volume ﬁlling factor, the average number of clouds along the
line of sight (N), and the average column density (NH). The smaller
the N, the more clumpy the torus. Liu & Li (2014) found that the
ﬁlling factor only slightly aﬀects the spectra, while N can change
the emergent spectra signiﬁcantly. A crude grid of NH (1023, 1024
and 1025 cm−2) and N (2, 5, 10) was simulated for a ﬁxed photon
index of Γ = 1.8. The simulated Fe Kα/Si Kα ratios for NH =
1024 cm−2 and 1025 cm−2 with a ﬁlling factor of 0.01 are plotted
in Fig. 2. For comparison, the results of the smooth cases are also
plotted.

First of all, we see that for the torus of NH = 1024 cm−2
with a smooth distribution, the Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio becomes smaller
when the viewing angle changes from edge-on to face-on. This
is due to less absorption of Si Kα photons in the face-on direc-
tion. For the clumpy torus, the Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio follows the same
trend, but with a smaller value when viewed edge-on. The more
clumpy the torus, the smaller the ratio. This is due to leakage of
Si Kα photons as discussed in the Introduction. For the case of
NH = 1025 cm−2, the absorption becomes so severe that even no Si
Kα photons appeared on some sight-lines. Nevertheless, the diﬀer-
ences between the clumpy and smooth torus are similar to those
for NH = 1024 cm−2. The torus of NH = 1025 cm−2 is optically
thick for Fe Kα photons, and the absorption of Fe Kα photons
leads to a smaller Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio when viewed edge-on com-
pared with the NH = 1024 cm−2 case. Note that, for N = 2, the
Fe Kα/Si Kα ratios become almost isotropic, the eﬀect of which
was discussed in detail in Liu & Li (2014).

leak through the torus, and thus on the clumpiness of the torus.
Therefore, X-ray ﬂuorescent lines at diﬀerent energies can be used
to probe the clumpiness of the torus. We have analysed a sam-
ple of type II AGN observed with Chandra HETGS and mea-
sured the ﬂuxes for the Si Kα and Fe Kα lines. The measured
Fe Kα/Si Kα ratios span a range between 5 − 60. These ratios are
far smaller than the simulated values for smooth tori, indicating
that the tori of the samples have clumpy distributions, rather than
smooth ones.

Compared with the simulation results of clumpy tori, the
Circinus galaxy has a Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio of ∼ 60, which is close
to the values of the N = 5 simulation . The Fe Kα/Si Kα ratios
of the other sources are all below the results of the N = 2 simula-
tion. This implies a very clump distribution for the torus. Below we
discuss several factors that can aﬀect the simulation results.

A direct factor aﬀecting the simulation results is the abun-
dance pattern. Liu & Li (2014) adopted the solar abundances from
Anders & Grevesse (1989), and no variable abundances are inves-
tigated. Recent studies have reduced the solar Fe abundance from
4.68 × 10−5 (number relative to H, Anders & Grevesse 1989) to
∼ 3 × 10−5 (e.g. Asplund et al. 2009). This will lead to a similar
decrease in the predicted Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio if the current abun-
dance pattern is assumed. Similarly, if the abundance ratio of Fe/Si
is changed several times, the Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio will also change
similarly.

Another uncertainty in the results is the photon index, Γ, which
is ﬁxed at 1.8 in Liu & Li (2014). For optically-thick material, the
emission of ﬂuorescent lines is proportional to the available num-
ber of photons that can ionize the corresponding K-shell electrons.
The relative number of photons at the ionization edge of Si and Fe
will be increased for a large Γ. To test the eﬀect of Γ, we re-run the
N = 2 simulation using a Γ of 2.2. The results for NH = 1024 cm−2
and 1025 cm−2 are plotted in Fig. 3 as dotted lines. As can be seen,
for NH = 1025 cm−2, the Fe Kα/Si Kα ratios are reduced by a
factor of ∼ 1.7, just as expected for optically-thick material. For
NH = 1024 cm−2, the material is not optically-thick for Fe K-shell
ionization yet, and the reduction in the ratio is less than the predic-
tion for optically-thick material.

Another unexplored eﬀect is the half-opening angle (or cover-
ing factor), which is ﬁxed to be 60◦. In principle, a smaller covering
factor will allow more photons to reach the observer, since it means
less obscuration by the front-side torus gas. The eﬀect on soft pho-
tons would be more signiﬁcant due to their larger absorption cross-
sections. Thus, smaller Fe Kα/Si Kα ratios would be expected for

Figure 2. Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio against cosine of the inclination angle from
simulations of clumpy tori with NH = 1024 cm−2 and 1025 cm−2 by
Liu & Li (2014). The inclination angle 0◦ corresponds to face-on viewing,
while 90◦ to edge-on. N is the average number of clouds along the line of
sight, which is smaller for a more clumpy torus. The measured ratios are
over-plotted according to their column densities, with an inclination angle
arbitrarily assigned. Note that the measured ratios are all far below the pre-
dictions of the smooth torus, indicating that the tori of the samples have a
clumpy distribution.

The measured Fe Kα/Si Kα line ratios are over-plotted in Fig.
2, either in the NH = 1024 cm−2 or the 1025 cm−2 panel, according
to the column densities quoted in recent literature (shown in Ta-
ble 1). The viewing angle is assigned with an arbitrary value larger
than the half-opening angle of the simulated geometry. For the type
II AGN studied here, to obscure the central AGN, the viewing an-
gle must be larger than the half-opening angle of the torus. For
Compton-thick sources, the reﬂection-dominated spectra indicate
that they are most likely to be viewed edge-on. We see that all the
measured Fe Kα/Si Kα ratios are far smaller than the predictions of
the smooth torus with viewing angles larger than the half-opening
angle of the torus. This indicates that the distribution of the tori
of the sources is far from being smooth. For the simulated geom-
etry of the clumpy torus, only the Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio of the Circi-
nus galaxy is close to the N = 5 simulation results. For the other
sources, the measured ratios are all below the simulation curve ﬁr
N = 2.

4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

X-ray ﬂuorescent lines are unique features of the reﬂection
spectrum of the torus around AGN, and can be relatively eas-
ily detected for obscured type II AGN. The spectral shape of the
reﬂection spectrum depends on the fraction of photons that can

smaller covering factors. To test the eﬀect of covering factor, we
also re-run the N = 2 simulation by adopting a half-opening angle
of 80◦, the results of which are plotted in Fig. 3 as dashed lines.
For NH = 1024 cm−2, the Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio can be decreased by a
factor of 2 for edge-on angles when using a half-opening angle of
80◦. For NH = 1025 cm−2, the eﬀect of changing the half-opening
angle is less signiﬁcant, due to severe absorption and the isotropic
nature of the emission.

We note that

the simulated column densities (1024 and
1025 cm−2) are not matched exactly with the observed ones of the
torus that were determined from the smooth torus models, which
are shown here to be invalid. It seems that by including all these
factors and with a clumpy torus of N ∼ 2 or smaller, the measured
relatively low Fe Kα/Si Kα ratios (∼ 7) can be obtained, without
resort to abnormally low Fe/Si abundances. Current simulations of
clumpy tori are limited by the crude grid and ﬁxed abundances,
geometry, and photon spectrum. It is clear that a ﬁttable clumpy
model, including the eﬀects of NH, Γ, variable abundances and cov-
ering factors, is needed to fully understand the X-ray spectra of ob-
scured AGN and to constrain the clumpiness of the torus. Such a
model will be presented in a future work.

The simulation of Liu & Li (2014) assumed that both the
Fe Kα and Si Kα photons are from the same torus, with the Si
Kα photons from a thinner layer due to the larger absorption sec-
tion at lower energy. In principle, the Si Kα photons can arise
from physically distinct clouds with NH ∼ 1022 cm−2, for which
the Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio is reduced signiﬁcantly. For sources with
NH > 1024 cm−2 and a covering factor ∼ 0.5, the contribution of
the Si Kα photons from distinct clouds with NH ∼ 1022 cm−2 is
unlikely to be signiﬁcant, since the intensity of Si Kα photons in-
creases with column density until saturated for large optical depth.
For the extreme case that clouds with NH ∼ 1022 cm−2 cover an-
other half sky, the reduction of the Fe Kα/Si Kα ratio can not be
larger than 50%. Nevertheless, the possibility of the origin of Si
Kα photons from distinct clouds could be important for sources
with NH ∼ 1023 cm−2.

Considering the contamination by the Mg XII Lyβ line to the
Si Kα line, the relatively isolated S Kα line at 2.3 keV would be a
better probe. However, due to the quick decline of the eﬀective area
of HEG around 2 keV, we found the S Kα line is only detectable
in Circinus, Mrk 3, and NGC 1068, and the ﬂux is similar to that
of the Si Kα line. Nevertheless, the eﬀective area around S, Ar, and
Ca Kα lines would be improved for the soft X-ray calorimeter on-
board Astro-H, which would also enable a much larger sample of
obscured AGN. The results show that non-Fe ﬂuorescent lines are
a potentially powerful probe of the clumpiness of the torus around
AGN.
