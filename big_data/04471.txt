We incorporate gauge-invariant local composite operators into the twistor-space formulation of
N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory.
In this formulation, the interactions of the elementary ﬁelds
are reorganized into inﬁnitely many interaction vertices and we argue that the same applies to
composite operators. To test our deﬁnition of the local composite operators in twistor space, we
compute several corresponding form factors, thereby also initiating the study of form factors using
the position twistor-space framework. Throughout this letter, we use the composite operator built
from two identical complex scalars as a pedagogical example; we treat the general case in a follow-up
paper.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In this letter, we explicitly demonstrate this principle

using the gauge-invariant local composite operator

The study of the simplest interacting gauge theory
in four dimensions, namely N = 4 Super Yang-Mills
(SYM), has led to a plethora of important theoretical
insights, such as holography (AdS/CFT), integrability
in the planar limit, on-shell methods and more. More-
over, the theory can be formulated in twistor space [1],
which has been an eﬃcient setting for computing on-shell
quantities such as amplitudes [2–6] and relating them to
light-like Wilson loops [7–9]. The action of N = 4 SYM
in twistor space is the sum of two parts S1 +S2, with S1,
introduced in [10], describing the self-dual part and S2,
referred to as the interaction piece, immediately giving
the maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) tree-level scat-
tering amplitudes [11]. However, computations involv-
ing oﬀ-shell quantities, such as form factors or correla-
tion functions of gauge-invariant local composite opera-
tors (composite operators), are less straightforward in the
twistor formalism, though some progress has been made
[12, 13]. To tackle oﬀ-shell objects, one needs a proper
deﬁnition of composite operators in twistor space, which
is the main subject of this letter [14].
In the usual space-time formulation, the composite op-
erator O consists of a single term that immediately deter-
mines its vertex. In contradistinction, we argue that the
twistor-space representation of O (or rather its vertex)
must contain inﬁnitely many terms as it has to describe
all interactions of O with elementary particles at minimal
MHV degree. In particular, all MHV tree-level form fac-
tors of the operator O have to be given immediately by
the operator vertex; an elementary counting of the MHV
degree shows that they cannot contain any twistor-space
propagators and hence also no interaction vertices.

O(cid:48) =

built out of two identical complex scalars. In particular,
we determine the correct twistor-space vertex for this op-
erator. An algorithm for generating the vertices for all
operators using Wilson loops will be given in a follow-up
paper.
The deﬁnition of a composite operator O in twistor
space can be probed by computing its tree-level MHV
form factor with external on-shell states A1, . . . , An and
comparing this to data from the literature. Tree-level
MHV form factors are the simplest quantities that con-
tain a composite operator and hence provide an ideal
testing ground for our deﬁnition of composite operators
in twistor space [15]. Letting pi be the momenta of the
on-shell states, and q the momentum of O, the form fac-
tor is deﬁned as the expectation value

(cid:90) d4x
(2π)4 e−iqx(cid:10)A1(p1)··· An(pn)(cid:12)(cid:12)O(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)0(cid:11) .

(2)
Form factors in N = 4 SYM are also interesting in their
own right and have received increasing attention, both at
weak coupling [16–37] and at strong coupling [38–40]. In
comparison to amplitudes, however, where all tree-level
expression [41] as well as the unregularized integrand of
all loop-level expressions [42] have been found, much less
is known for form factors; see [43] for the state of the art.
In particular, the form factors of the operator O(cid:48) are also
phenomenologically interesting, as they are related to the
Higgs-to-gluons amplitude in QCD; cf. [23].

pertwistors Z ∈ CP3|4 as Z = (λα, µ ˙α, χa), where the
χa are fermionic, α, ˙α ∈ {1, 2} and a ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}. Su-
pertwistor space is naturally related to chiral Minkowski
superspace M4|8, which is obtained by appending eight
Graßmann variables θαa to each point xα ˙α in Minkowski
space. Each point (x, θ) in M4|8 corresponds to a unique
projective line in supertwistor space given by the set of
supertwistors

Z = (λα, ixα ˙αλα, iθaαλα) ,

λ ∈ CP1 .

(3)

For brevity, we denote a line in supertwistor space by x
instead of (x, θ) and we denote by Zx(λ) the supertwistor
(3) on the line x given by the spinor λ.

In order to obtain a ﬁeld Φ in space-time, the standard
prescription is to Penrose transform [45, 46] a ﬁeld in
twistor space ˜Φ, i.e. integrating the twistor-space ﬁeld ˜Φ
over the line in CP3|4 corresponding to (x, θ) as

Φ(x) =

CP1

Dλ ˜Φ(Zx(λ)) ,

(4)

(cid:104)λdλ(cid:105)
where Dλ =
2πi . The angle bracket is deﬁned as
(cid:104)λλ(cid:48)(cid:105) = λαλ(cid:48)
α with αβλα = λβ and 12 = 1. For fu-
ture reference, we note that integrals over the spinors λ
are always taken over the projective line CP1, so that we
can omit this from the integral sign.
The twistor action [1] is written using a single connec-
tion superﬁeld A introduced in [47]. This superﬁeld com-
bines the on-shell degrees of freedom of N = 4 SYM – the
two helicity ±1 gluons g±, the four helicity 1
2 fermions
¯ψa and their antiparticles ψa and the six scalars φab – as

(5)
where the components ﬁelds g±, . . . do not depend on
the Graßmann variables χ. According to (4), a natural
ﬁrst attempt [48, 49] for the (gauge-covariant) scalar ﬁeld
φab(x) is given by a Penrose transform
∂2A(λ)

(6)
where A(λ) ≡ A(Zx(λ)). In (6), we set θ = 0, implying
χa = iθαaλα = 0, after taking the derivatives, because
we are only interested in the φab component of (5). In
addition, we have introduced hx(λ) – the frame on x that
trivializes the connection A along the line x and thus
ensures gauge invariance when taking traces of products
of these ﬁelds [49].
Therefore, using the ansatz (6), the operator O(cid:48) built

∂χa∂χb hx(λ)(cid:12)(cid:12)θ=0

out of two scalars would read

(cid:90)

where Ux(λ, λ(cid:48)) = hx(λ)hx(λ(cid:48))−1 is the parallel propaga-
tor for the connection A. It can be expanded as

Ux(λ, λ(cid:48)) ≡ Ux(Zx(λ),Zx(λ(cid:48)))

.

(8)

In order to obtain form factors (2), which are nat-
urally expressed in momentum space, we insert exter-
nal on-shell momentum states [5] of (super-)momentum
P = (pα ˙α, ηa) = (pα, ¯p ˙α, ηa):

AP(Z) = 2πi

where ¯δ2(λ) = ¯δ1(λ1)¯δ1(λ2) with the ¯δ1(z) denoting
the δ function on the complex plane. Let us com-
pute FO(cid:48)(1+, . . . , iφab , . . . , jφab , . . . , n+; q):
the (color-
ordered) form factor of O(cid:48) with n external particles, two
of which are scalars φab at positions i and j, while the
remaining ones are positive-helicity gluons. Here, only
the terms in (8) with the appropriate number of A’s con-
tribute, namely those with j − i − 1 from one Ux and
n+i−j−1 from the other. Inserting the on-shell states (9)
into (8) as well as directly into (7) and then integrating
over s and the corresponding λ eﬀectively cancels s and
replaces λα → pα, µ ˙α → ixα ˙αpα and χa → iθαapα due
to the ¯δ2 function and the parametrization (3). Select-
ing the coeﬃcient of the corresponding η’s and Fourier
(2π)4 e−iqx yields the desired form

(10)

which perfectly agrees with the result of [17]. We would
like to comment that the parallel propagators Ux(λ, λ(cid:48)) in
(7), introduced in order to ensure gauge invariance, are
responsible for inserting inﬁnitely many vertices in the
description of the composite operators related to their
MHV coupling to positive-helicity gluons.

III.

. . . AND WHERE IT FAILS

While the successful computation of the form factor
(10) is encouraging, the ansatz (7) fails once one considers
external states involving fermions. Speciﬁcally, let us
take the MHV form factor

(7)

which was ﬁrst calculated in [19]. However, using the
twistor-space machinery and (7), we would obtain zero.
This can be seen as follows. On the one hand, the con-
tribution to the form factor (11) has to come solely from

the operator O(cid:48) itself, since the inclusion of an interaction
vertex from S2 connected by a propagator to O(cid:48) would
increase the MHV degree. On the other hand, every form
factor obtained from (7) will necessarily contain two on-
∂2A
shell scalars due to the
∂χa∂χb terms, while (11) contains
only one.

We conclude that it is necessary to add extra terms
encoding the contribution to the form factor (11) directly
into the twistor-space expression of the operator O(cid:48).

IV. OUR PROPOSAL

As previously argued, the twistor-space avatar of any
operator O has to contain the terms that allow the ele-
mentary ﬁelds to split into diﬀerent ones while preserving
the MHV degree. Hence, we propose to complete (6) to

φab(x) =

Dλ h−1

x (λ)

(cid:90) DλDλ(cid:48)
(cid:104)λλ(cid:48)(cid:105) h−1

∂χa∂χb hx(λ)(cid:12)(cid:12)θ=0
∂A(λ)
∂χa Ux(λ, λ(cid:48))

∂A(λ(cid:48))

∂χ(cid:48)b hx(λ(cid:48))(cid:12)(cid:12)θ=0

(12)

It is depicted in ﬁgure 1. An immediate observation is
that in (12) the χ-derivatives are now distributed super-
symmetrically, unlike in (6).

FIG. 1. The vertex of an operator containing a scalar φab
includes all its MHV-preserving splitting terms.

Our proposal for the correction of the expression (7)
is now obtained by squaring (12) and taking the trace.
Since it has nine terms, we refrain from writing it out.
Using (12) and the methods of section II leads to the
correct result (11). We can do even better and straight-
forwardly derive the MHV super form factor of O(cid:48):

FO(cid:48)(1, . . . , n; q)

δ4(q −(cid:80)n

k=1 pk)(cid:81)

=

(cid:16)(cid:80)

c=a,b

(cid:104)12(cid:105)(cid:104)23(cid:105)···(cid:104)n1(cid:105)

i<j(cid:104)ij(cid:105)ηicηjc

.

(13)

(cid:17)

This agrees with the results of [19] and with (10) and
(11) when the respective components are speciﬁed.

3

Looking at (12) and recalling the product rule, one is
tempted to try to generate (12) by some kind of double
derivative. For this, we must replace the operator at
point x by a polygonal light-like Wilson loop [50] with
an appropriate number of edges x1, . . . , xn:

W = Tr(cid:2)Ux1 (Z1,Z2)··· Uxn (Zn,Z1)(cid:3) ,

(14)
where the Zi are the twistors at the intersection of the
line xi−1 and xi. We can then act on W with four θ-
derivatives and ﬁnally shrink the Wilson loop back to a
point, recovering our expression for O(cid:48). We describe this
procedure in full detail in a forthcoming publication [51],
where we also derive the analogues of (12) for the rest of
the ﬁeld content of N = 4 SYM.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In this letter, we described how to incorporate com-
posite operators into the twistor-space formulation of
N = 4 SYM. Just as translating the action to twistor
space shuﬄes the interaction terms into inﬁnitely many
vertices, so does the translation of the composite opera-
tors require the repackaging of inﬁnitely many operator
vertices. Form factors provide the ideal testing ground
for our construction as they are the simplest quantities
that contain composite operators. Thus, we simultane-
ously initiated the study of form factors in N = 4 SYM
using the position twistor-space framework.

In a forthcoming publication [51], we use the Wilson
loop that we hinted at in section IV to derive the tree-
level MHV super form factors of all composite operators.
We extend the framework to NkMHV form factors and
correlation functions in a further publication [52].
