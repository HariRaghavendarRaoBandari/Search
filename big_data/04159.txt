Abstract

We are going to calculate the ﬂow of the angular momentum and ﬂux of the
Hawking radiation in the rotating regular black hole with the time-delay proposed
in Ref.[1], based on the anomaly cancellation. We ﬁrst try to reduce the ﬁeld
theories to the inﬁnite two-dimensional massless free models in which the anomaly
cancellation method is possible, in the three metrics in Ref.[1]. We demonstrate
that the two of them can be reduced. We perform the calculation in these two
metrics, and obtain the ﬂow of the angular momentum and ﬂux of the Hawking
radiation in these two metrics. Our result involves the three eﬀects: the quantum
gravity eﬀect regularizing the gravity sources of the black holes, the black hole
rotation, and the time-delay. Hence our result could be considered to correspond
to a more realistic Hawking radiations.

Introduction

The gravity sources of the black holes form the singularities in the classical theories.
However the quantum gravity eﬀect is considered to become strong in the gravity sources
when the gravity sources close up to the plank scale, and it is expected that the repulsive
forces which stop the gravity sources to form the singularities appear. As a result, the
singularities in the classical black holes can be expected not to exist in the realistic black
holes. These black holes are referred to as the regular black holes or non-singular black
holes.

Currently many stars which can be expected as the black holes have been discovered,
and the regular black holes are considered to correspond to these actual black holes.
Hence the regular black holes are of course not only very interesting in terms of the
quantum gravity, but also very interesting in terms of the realistic black holes.

Until now the Schwarzschild regular black hole and its rotating version have been
proposed in Refs.[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and [10, 11, 12, 13] respectively (Ref.[14] as a
review paper for the regular black holes). The four-dimensional rotating regular black
holes with the time-delay (the gravitational time dilation) has also been proposed [1].

Since the four-dimensional rotating regular black holes with the time-delay could be
considered to correspond to more realistic black holes, it would be one of particularly
interesting topics for us. In such a situation, we would like to focus on the ﬂow of the
angular momentum and ﬂux of the Hawking radiation from that in Ref.[1].

Now several ways have been convented (Ref.[15] as a review paper) for the calcu-
lation of the Hawking radiations, and in 2005 a calculation algorithm has newly been
convented [16]. It is the anomaly cancellation method, which is an algorithm to deter-
mine the ﬂuxes of the Hawking radiation based on a demand that there is no anomaly
near the horizon. This algorithm is possible when the ﬁeld theories on the black hole
space-times to be ingredient of the Hawking ﬂuxes can reduce to an inﬁnite collection of
the two-dimensional free massless model near the horizon. Once the ﬁeld theories reduce
to the two-dimensional form, the calculation can be performed using the information
only in the near horizon region without depending on the details of the models. Since
the ﬁeld theories can reduce to that form in many black hole space-times, the anomaly
cancellation method is considered as very universal.

Hence we in this paper calculate the ﬂow of the angular momentum and ﬂux of the
Hawking radiation in the rotating regular black hole with the time-delay [1] based on
the anomaly cancellation method [17, 18].

The calculation for the Hawking radiations in the regular black hole by the anomaly
cancellation method has already been performed [19]. However the calculation involving
the rotation and the time-delay has not been performed yet, and what we calculate in
this paper is that. By this, we would like to provide a more realistic Hawking radia-
tions which involves the three eﬀects: the quantum gravity eﬀect regularizing the gravity
sources of the black holes, the black hole rotation, and the time-delay.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec.2, the three metrics of the rotating regular
black holes with the time-delay are given. In Sec.3, it is shown that the action of the
matter ﬁelds can reduce to the two-dimensional form in which the anomaly cancellation

method is possible near the horizon in the type II or III metrics. In Sec.4, the ﬂow of
the angular momentum and ﬂux of the Hawking radiation are calculated by the anomaly
cancellation method. Sec.5 is the summary of this paper.

However, we do not know how to solve ˜∆ in eq.(4) to get r± analytically. Further, making
the plots of r± to show these numerically is hard for the fact that r± depend on three
parameters: a, lp and m. Hence, considering that lp ≪ 1, we solve ˜∆ perturbatively in
terms of lp. ˜∆ can be expanded as ˜∆ = a2 − 2m0r + r2 + 2m0l3

Let us note that the ﬁrst two terms are the normal ones in the Kerr black holes, and the
third term is the quantum gravity eﬀect.

Then, we consider the three rotating regular black holes with the time-delay [1],

which can be obtained by the following manipulation to the metric of eq.(1):

the quantum gravity. We give the r-, β- and m0-dependences in Fig.1. Since the β-
and the m-dependences are the same in the expression of G, we do not make a plot for
the m-dependence in Fig.1. We can see from Fig.1 that G becomes smaller as β or m0
become smaller, for a same α. On the other hand, G becomes smaller as r becomes
larger, for the same α.

3 Dimensional reduction of the ﬁeld theories near

the horizon

Now we consider the quantum ﬁeld theories which will be the ingredient of the Hawking
ﬂuxes, on the background space-times classically given by the type I, II and III metrics.
However for now let us focus on the scalar ﬁeld part in the whole action, which is

Sscalar =

2Z d4x √−g(cid:16)gM N ∂M φ∂N φ + Lmass + Lint(cid:17).

We can ﬁnd that the term Lmass + Lint is suppressed near the horizon for the fact
Deﬁning as K ≡ −√−g(√−g)−1∂µ(√−g gµν∂ν), we can ﬁnd that K in the type I

that ˜∆ vanishes at the horizon. Hence we disregard Lmass + Lint near the horizon‡.

the spherical harmonic oscillator function: φ(t, r, θ, φ) = Plm ϕlm(t, r)Ylm(θ, φ). Then

we can ﬁnd that the models reduce to the inﬁnite free massless scalar ﬁeld theories as

p, q and s are given in eq.(11), and the backgrounds in the above are classical.

On the other hand, the scalar ﬁeld in the type I metric does not reduce to the two-
dimensional one, near the horizon, as can be seen from eq.(9). Its reason is, ﬁrst, the
diﬀerence in how to mix G in the procedure above eq.(7). Correspondingly, how ˜∆
appears in the expressions of gM N (the inverse of gM N ) comes to diﬀerent between the

type I and type II, III metrics. As a result, the surviving terms in K come to also
diﬀerent between the type I and type II, III metrics.

From this result, we can ﬁnd that the whole action of the quantum ﬁelds can be
treated as the inﬁnite two-dimensional action with the classical background in eq.(13),
near the horizon, if the background space-time is the type II or III metric. The reduction
to the two-dimensional form such as eq.(12) is indispensable in the anomaly cancellation
method. Hence we in this paper consider the type II and III metrics.

Here let us note that we do not need to specify the whole quantum ﬁeld theory.
Because we in this paper consider the situation after the models have been reduced,
which is an advantage of the anomaly cancellation method.

Now that the expressions near the horizon have been obtained as in eq.(13), let us

here give the surface gravities in the type II and III metrics as

4 Calculation of the Hawking radiations from the

anomaly cancellation

Using the fact in the last of the previous section, we in this section calculate the U(1)
gauge current and the energy-momentum tensor in the two-dimensional models at the
near horizon region in the type II and III metrics, based on the anomaly cancellation
method§. Then we ﬁnally obtain the ﬂow of the angular momentum and the ﬂux of the
Hawking radiation by identifying our results with these.

Our calculation is carried out in the same fashion with Refs.[17, 18], basically. The

stuﬀs in what follows are on the type II and III metrics.

4.1 Dividing of the radial direction

First we set up the radial direction. It is known that the ingoing modes do not make
the classical contribution to the exterior of the horizon, on the horizon. Then we divide
the radial direction in the exterior of the horizon into two regions as

r+ ≤ r ≤ r+ + ǫ,

r+ + ǫ < r ≤ ro,

(15)
(16)

as the region where there is the classical contribution from the ingoing modes or not.
Corresponding to this, ǫ ≪ 1. ro stands for the maximum r in which the quantum ﬁeld
theory can be described as the two-dimensional model. Namely we assume that the
reduction to the two-dimensional model in Sec.3 is possible for r+ ≤ r ≤ ro. We refer to
the two regions in eqs.(15) and (16) as the regions H and O, respectively.

§ A description is given for the relation between the U(1) gauge currents and the energy-momentum
tensors in the two-dimensional and four-dimensional ﬁeld theories, in the Kerr black holes without the
regularization [18].

5

The purpose to do this is that we would like to treat the left- and right-handed modes
distinctively in the region H. Here, the left- and right-handed modes mean the modes
in the two-dimensional ﬁeld theories, which respectively correspond to the outgoing and
ingoing modes. Further, we would like to carry out the calculation in the two-dimensional
one. Hence we have deﬁned the region where it is possible, using ro.

4.2 Flow of the angular momentum from the calculation of the

U(1) gauge current

Corresponding to the regions O and H, we write the U(1) gauge current as

J µ = J µ

(o)Θ+ + J µ

(H)H,

(17)

(o) and J µ

where µ, ν = t, r, and Θ+ ≡ Θ(r − (r+ + ǫ)) and H ≡ 1 − Θ+. Here Θ(r) is a step
function. Thus J µ
(H) stand for the U(1) gauge currents in the regions O and H,
respectively. Since our background space-time is independent of the time as in eq.(13), we
let the U(1) gauge current have the r-dependence only: J µ
(H)(r).
In the region O, the U(1) gauge current is conserved as

(o)(r) and J µ

(H) = J µ

(o) = J µ

∇µJ µ

(o) = 0.

(18)

On the other hand, in the region H, let us consider the contribution of the left- or
right-handed modes distinctively in the conservation equation of the U(1) gauge current.
Then as the anomalous equation for the chiral transformation in the two-dimensional
theories, it can be written as¶

∇µJ µ

(H) = ±

m2

4π√−g

ǫµν∂µAν,

(19)

where ǫtr = 1, and +/− respectively correspond to the chiral situation where there is
only left-/right-handed modes, respectively.
Now let us consider to omit the right-handed (ingoing) modes tentatively, and con-
sider the left-handed (outgoing) modes only, in the region H. As a result, we can write
the U(1) gauge current in the regions O and H as

J r
(o) = co,

J r
(H) = cH +

m2

4π Z r

r+

dr∂rAt,

(20)

(21)

¶ We can ﬁnd that eq.(19) is given by ∇µJ µ

where co and cH are the integral constants that respectively stand for the values of the
U(1) gauge current at r = ro and r+. At in the type II and III metrics are given in
4π√−g ǫµν ∂µAν , if we calculate the two-dimensional
chiral anomaly [23, 24]. Hence there is apparently a discrepancy in the power of m. However our U (1)
(H) ≡ m ¯ψγµψ. Here the usual one is ¯ψγµψ. The
gauge current J µ
former and latter ones are interpreted as the electric charge density current and the probability density
current, respectively.

(H) = ± m
(H) can be considered to be deﬁned as J µ

eq.(13). The r in the upper bound of the integration is taken less than ro. Here we
do not need to consider the t-component of the current J t. Because we can show that
∇µJ µ = ∂rJ r. As a result, J t is irrelevant in the calculation of eq.(22).
Now let us consider the eﬀective action W given by the two-dimensional model at the
near horizon region, in which all the modes in the interior of the horizon and the outside
of ro have been integrated out. Then, in the situation that the quantum contribution of
the ingoing modes is omitted in the region H, the variation of W under the U(1) gauge
transformation can be written as

− δW = Z dtdr√−g λ ∇µJ µ

= Z dtdrλ(cid:26)δ(cid:0)r − (r+ + ǫ)(cid:1)(cid:18)J r

(o) − J r

(H) +

m2
4π

At(cid:19) +

e2
4π

∂r (AtH)(cid:27) , (22)

where λ = λ(t, r) is the U(1) gauge transformation parameter, the integration range of
r is r+ ≤ r ≤ ro, and J µ is given in eqs.(20) and (21).
Originally the theory is anomaly-free for U(1) gauge transformation even near the
horizon. Further, the original theory contains the right-handed modes. The contribu-
tion of the right-handed modes is quantum near the horizon, which contributes to the
anomaly. Hence the theory becomes anomaly-free and δW = 0 by what the anomalies
of the left- and right-handed modes are canceled each other.

Corresponding to such a physical situation, we can see from eq.(19) that the U(1)
gauge current of the right-handed modes can be taken so that it can cancel the second
term in r.h.s. in eq.(22). Then the ﬁrst term remains. The ﬁrst term should also vanish,
which can be realized by the following constraint:

c0 = cH −

m2
4π

At(r+).

We now ﬁx cH by the condition that the covariant current:

˜J µ ≡ J µ ∓

m2

4π√−g

ǫνµAν,

(23)

(24)

vanishes at the horizon, where − and + respectively correspond to the left- and right-
handed modes, and whose conservation equation is ∇µ ˜J µ = ± m2
4π√−g ǫµνF µν. As a result
cH can be ﬁxed as cH = − m2

Substituting the above cH into c0 in eq.(23), we can determine c0 as

4π At(r+).

c0 = −

m2
2π

At(r+) =

m2aGq(r+)
2π(r2
+ + a2)

,

(25)

where q for the type II and III metrics are given in eq.(11). Since q = 0 in the type III
metric, c0 in the type III metric has no dependence on the time-delay.

In the case of the rotating black hole without the regularization in the gravity source,
c0 is identiﬁed as the ﬂow of the angular momentum associated with the Hawking ther-
mal (black body) radiation [18]. Hence we also identify the above c0 as the ﬂow of

7

the angular momentum from the regular rotating black hole with the time-delay, which
involves the three eﬀects: G (the time-delay), a (the angular momentum of the black
holes), and r+ = r+(lp) as in eq.(6) (lp stands for the quantum gravity eﬀect regularizing
the gravity source of our black hole).

The r-, β- and m0-dependences in c0 via G can be known from Fig.1. We can see
from Fig.1 that the diﬀerences of r-, β- and m0-dependences in c0 are small, when α
closes to 1, where α ∼ 1 corresponds to the situation that the time-delay eﬀect is small.
On the other hand, when α closes to 0, c0 becomes large, where the situation that α ∼ 0
corresponds to the situation that the time-delay eﬀect is large.

4.3 Flux of the Hawking radiation from the calculation of the

energy-momentum tensor

We next determine the energy-momentum tensor. In order to this, we start with the
general coordinate transformation; xµ 7→ x′µ = xµ − ξµ(t, r). Corresponding to this,
the ﬁelds are shifted, which are given by the Lie derivative: δgµν = −(∇µξν + ∇νξµ),
δAµ = ξν∂νAµ + ∂µξνAν and δΦ = ξµ∂µΦ. Now, since the metrics and the gauge and
dilaton ﬁelds in our background are classical as in eq.(13), the distribution function can

be written as Z ≡ Z[gµν, Aµ, Φ] = R D[matters] exp iS[gµν, Aµ, Φ, matters] in the region
r+ ≤ r ≤ ro. Z should be invariant under the general coordinate transformation, which
leads to the following Ward identity:

(27)

In the above, the last term is the consistent anomaly, where +/− is adopted when
there is only the left-handed (outgoing)/right-handed (ingoing) modes, respectively. The
second term is also an anomalous when the situation is chiral, the value of which is
given in eq.(19). The ﬁrst and third terms are the classical contributions breaking
the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, which arise due to the fact that our
background gauge and dilaton ﬁelds are classical, as in eq.(13).

Now, as well as eq.(17), we write the energy-momentum tensor as

T µ

ν = T µ

ν(o)Θ+ + T µ

Then, in the region O, the identity of eq.(27) leads to

On the other hand, in the region H, as well as the preceding analysis, let us consider

k In the two-dimensional gravitational anomaly, if it depends only on r, we can ﬁnd a general

relation: ∂r(√−g( ˜T r

where we have used a fact: T r

= aH, which can be seen from eq.(33), and eq.(14).
Now, considering the eﬀective action W given by the two-dimensional model, let us
consider its variation under the general coordinate transformation. At this time, as can
be seen from eq.(26), the gauge and dilaton ﬁelds are relevant. However for now let us
consider it only for the energy-momentum tensor as

t(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r+

where we have omitted the contribution of the right-handed modes as well as eq.(22).
From the second line to third line, we have ignored ξr∇µT µ
r for the reason written
below eq.(31). In the r.h.s. of the third line, although the ﬁrst term is breaking the
invariance, it can be tolerated for the fact that our background gauge ﬁeld is classical,
as in eq.(13). The second and third terms are anomalous, which should vanish, since the
original theory is anomaly-free.

If we take back the right-handed modes, the second term should be canceled by the
quantum contribution of the right-handed modes. Then from the demand that the third
term should vanish, the following constraint is led:

− N r
Using aH in eq.(38), we can obtain the following a0:

In the case of the rotating black hole without the regularization in the gravity source,
a0 is identiﬁed as the ﬂux of the Hawking radiation [18]. Hence we also identify the above
a0 as that of the regular rotating black hole with the time-delay. In what follows, we
can say the same thing with the one written under eq.(25) for the above a0.

5 Summary

We have calculated the ﬂow of the angular momentum and the ﬂux of the Hawking radi-
ation from the type II and III metrics of the rotating regular black holes with the time-
delay [1]. As for the type I metric, the ﬁeld theory cannot reduce to the two-dimensional
theory in which the anomaly cancellation method is possible, near the horizon region.

The Hawking radiations we have calculated in this paper involves three eﬀects: the
regularization eﬀect of lp (the quantum gravity eﬀect regularizing the gravity source),

10

the eﬀect of a (the black hole rotation), and G(r) (the time-delay eﬀect). Hence our
result could be considered to correspond to a more realistic one.

Currently many stars which can be considered as the black holes have been discovered.

In terms of a realistic Hawking radiations, our result would be interesting.
