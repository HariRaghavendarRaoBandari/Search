We use a strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG) method and ground-state quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to study S = 1/2 spin chains with random couplings, calculat-
ing disorder-averaged spin and dimer correlations. The QMC simulations demonstrate logarithmic
corrections to the power-law decaying correlations obtained with the SDRG scheme. The same
asymptotic forms apply both for systems with standard Heisenberg exchange and for certain multi-
spin couplings leading to spontaneous dimerization in the clean system.
In the latter case, in
the presence of disorder, random singlets form between spinons localized at domain walls. This
amorphous valence-bond solid is asymptotically a random-singlet state and only diﬀers from the
random-exchange Heisenberg chain in its short-distance properties.

A remarkably simple but powerful method was intro-
duced some time ago by Ma et al. for studies of quan-
tum magnets with random couplings [1]: In a repeated
decimation procedure, the strongest coupled spin pair
is identiﬁed and put into a singlet state, which decou-
ples from the rest of the system after new eﬀective cou-
plings are generated among the remaining spins. This
strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG) scheme
often ﬂows toward a random singlet (RS) ﬁxed-point [2],
which is universal for a broad class of spin chains [3]. The
SDRG method has become a standard tool for studying
a wide range of systems [4–17] and the RS phase repre-
sents a corner-stone of our understanding of disorder in
quantum many-body physics.

Here we compare SDRG calculations and ground-state
projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations for
two types of S = 1/2 spin chains which in the absence of
disorder have very diﬀerent ground states; the standard
quasi-ordered (critical) Heisenberg antiferromagnet and a
spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) sys-
tem. In the latter, we demonstrate an amorphous VBS
(AVBS) with out-of-phase dimerized chain segments sep-
arated by spin-carrying domain walls, as illustrated in
Fig. 1. Despite the very diﬀerent local properties of the
two systems, they both exhibit characteristic RS proper-
ties in their long-distance correlations. Our results also
show that the SDRG method misses universal multiplica-
tive logarithmic (log) corrections to the algebraic spin
and dimer correlation functions that should be included
when characterizing the RS phase. Similar corrections
were noted [18, 19] in other classes of disordered spin
chains but had not been anticipated in the present case.

Models and methods.—We consider interactions writ-
ten with singlet projectors Pi,j = 1/4 − Si · Sj on pairs
of spins. The antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian

is −JiPi,i+1 summed over i = 1, . . . , N , where Ji > 0 is
a random antiferromagnetic coupling. To achieve a ro-
bust VBS state (an AVBS in the presence of disorder)
accessible to QMC calculations without sign problems,
we use the six-spin interaction −QiPi,i+1Pi+2,i+3Pi+4,i+5
[20] summed over all i with random Qi > 0. A similar
four-spin coupling also leads to a VBS, but with a much
smaller order parameter. Note that the clean Hamilto-
nian (Qi = 1 ∀i) is translationally invariant and the sys-
tem dimerizes by spontaneous symmetry-breaking, lead-
ing to a two-fold degenerate ground state. In both mod-
els we use periodic boundary conditions and the following
distribution of the random couplings (λ = Ji or λ = Qi):

π(λ) =(cid:26) d−1λ1/d−1,

0,

for 0 < λ ≤ 1,
else,

(1)

which is uniform within the range (0, 1] for d = 1 and
becomes singular when d → ∞.
The SDRG method for the random-J model is well
documented and we refer to the literature [11]. The
generalization to the random-Q model
is non-trivial,
as the multi-spin interaction generates various terms of
the forms Pi,i+1Pi+2,i+3 and Pi,j under strong-disorder
renormalization, with several diﬀerent cases in the per-
turbative treatment of the decimated operators. The
method is described in Supplemental Material [21].

For the QMC calculations, we employ a ground-state

projection technique operating in the valence-bond ba-
sis [22, 23]. This basis is ideal for singlet ground states,
as S > 0 excitations are excluded from the outset, unlike
ﬁnite-temperature methods which include the full Hilbert
space. In the present case, the convergence to the ground
state is accelerated by projecting from “trial states” ob-
tained using the SDRG method for each set of random
couplings. For the projector, we use a power (−H)m of
the Hamiltonian and carefully check for convergence as
a function of m. Another advantage of the valence-bond
basis is the easy access to correlation functions expressed
in terms of transition-graph loops [24–26].

Correlations in the RS phase.—One of the key ana-
lytical SDRG results in one dimension is that the long-
distance staggered spin-spin correlation function C(r) =
(−1)rhSi · Si+ri decays with distance r as r−2 in the RS
phase [3], in contrast to the form C(r) ∼ r−1 ln1/2(r) in
the clean Heisenberg chain [27–30]. The asymptotic r−2
decay has been tested by numerical calculations in spin
chains with anisotropic interactions, in particular in the
random XX chain [31, 32], which can be mapped to free
fermions. Systems with isotropic Heisenberg interactions
have proved much more challenging and the available nu-
merical evidence is less convincing. Studies have been
carried out using QMC calculations [32, 33], the density-
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [6, 34] and, more
recently, tensor-network (TN) methods [35].

In standard ﬁnite-temperature QMC calculations the
temperature T has to be very low in order to study the
ground state without signiﬁcant T > 0 contributions.
The fact that the volume of the sampled path-integral
conﬁgurations scales as N/T makes calculations particu-
larly diﬃcult in the RS phase because the ﬁnite-size gaps
(and, thus, the T required) decrease exponentially with
the system size (the dynamic exponent z = ∞). The
system sizes have therefore been rather modest, up to
N ≈ 50− 100, and there may be some ﬁnite-T eﬀects left
in published long-distance correlations [21]. The DMRG
and TN calculations are carried out at T = 0 and instead
convergence has to be ensured with the number of states
or the tensor dimension. Convergence diﬃculties with
DMRG for disordered Heisenberg systems limited early
calculations to N ≈ 30 [6, 34]. The TN calculations were
implemented in a way stimulated by the SDRG scheme
[35], but it is not clear whether the tensor sizes used are
suﬃciently large for full convergence.

Using the projector QMC method, for the random-
J model we have achieved ground-state convergence for
system sizes up to N = 144 with d = 1 in the the dis-
tribution (1) and up to N = 64 for d = 2, in each case
using between 104 and 106 disorder realizations to achieve
suﬃciently small error bars on mean values. As an ex-
ample of a convergence test, in Fig. 2 we show results
for the disorder-averaged spin correlation function at the
longest distance, r = N/2, of a random-J system with
d = 1. Two diﬀerent trial states lead to values agreeing

FIG. 2. (Color online) Projection-power convergence of the

two diﬀerent trial states; the SDRG state obtained for each

bond-length (l) amplitude h(l) = l−2.

within error bars, but with faster convergence observed
with the SDRG states than a translationally invariant
amplitude-product (AP) state [23, 24]. For the random-
Q model the convergence is faster, and we have results for
N almost twice as large as for the random-J model. To
speed up the equilibration of the QMC calculations with
high powers of m, an m-doubling procedure analogous
to the doubling procedure for the inverse temperature
in Ref. [36] was used, where each simulation starts from
m = N , after which m is gradually doubled by making
an operator string of length 2m out of two consecutive
copies of the original string.

Results for the spin correlation function versus r =
N/2 are compared with SDRG results in Fig. 3(a). The
SDRG results follow the expected r−2 decay for both dis-
tributions (we included a correction term to ﬁt the data
very closely also at short distances), while the QMC re-
sults clearly deviate from this form. Previous works have
not discussed how the asymptotic form is approached;
it has merely been expected that, for long enough dis-
tances, results should approach the SDRG power law.
We observe clear deviations from r−2 even for rather
long distances, but the data for both d = 1 and 2,
and even for very small r, can be described by the
form C(r) ∝ r−2 lnσs (r/r0) with 0.3 . σs . 0.7. As
mentioned above, such a multiplicative log correction is
present for the clean system (with σs = 1/2, which we
also use in the ﬁts shown), but the marginal operator
responsible for it is not expected to play any role in a
strongly disordered system. Logs produced by perturba-
tive disorder have been demonstrated in certain systems
without marginal operators in the clean limit [19], and it
has also been argued that the correlations in the strongly-
disordered XX chain are aﬀected by a log correction [18].
We are not aware of any previous suggestions of log cor-
rections in the random exchange Heisenberg chain, and
the log-exponent we ﬁnd is diﬀerent from the one in [18].

ferent disorder parameters d. The SDRG results in (a) have
been ﬁtted to the form C(r) = αr−2 + βr−4, with adjustable
constants α and β. The form C(r) ∝ r−2 ln1/2(r/r0) was
In (b) the ﬁtting forms are

D∗(r) = αr−4 + βr−5 (SDRG) and D∗(r) ∝ r−4 ln(r/r0).

We have also computed the dimer correlation function
D(r) = hBi · Bi+ri, where Bi = Si · Si+1, which to our
knowledge has not been previously considered, neither in
SDRG nor QMC calculations. In the clean Heisenberg
chain the dominant dimer correlations are staggered, de-
caying in real space as r−1 ln−3/2(r) [29] (i.e., with only
the power of the log correction being diﬀerent from that
in the spin correlations). We deﬁne the staggered dimer
correlation function as

D∗(r) = [D(r) − 1

2 D(r − 1) − 1

2 D(r + 1)](−1)r.

(2)

Fig. 3(b) shows results versus N for r = N/2. The SDRG
results can be ﬁtted to the form D∗(r) = αr−4 + βr−5,
with constants α and β depending on d. The QMC data
are again much better described with a log correction,
D∗(r) ∝ r−4 lnσd (r/r0), with σd ≈ 1 (good ﬁts require
0.5 . σd . 1.5) and only r0 depending on d.
It is tempting to interpret D∗(r) as the square of C(r),
but there is nothing obvious in the deﬁnition of the dimer
correlation function or its valence-bond estimator to sug-
gest such a relationship. In the case of the single valence-
bond state resulting from the SDRG procedure, there are
two contributions to D(r) (out of four in a completely
general state [25]) [21]. We ﬁnd that the contributions
from two nearest-neighbor bonds completely dominate
D(r) and D∗(r) in the SDRG ground state, with contri-
butions from longer bonds decaying with a higher power
[21]. In contrast, C(r) is governed by the probability dis-
tribution P (r) of bond lengths. In the QMC calculations
the full loop representation of the correlations come into

3

play [25] and the interpretation of the diﬀerent contribu-
tions to D(r) is less clear-cut.

Amorphous valence-bond solid.—The clean Q model is
VBS ordered and when combined with the Heisenberg ex-
change J it undergoes a transition to the standard critical
antiferromagnet at J/Q ≈ 6 [20, 37]. The dimerization
transition is in the same universality class as that in the
well-studied J1-J2 Heisenberg chain [38–40]. An impor-
tant question is how disorder aﬀects such a transition and
the VBS state. In the latter, one can expect an AVBS
with alternating domains of the two diﬀerent dimeriza-
tion patterns (which diﬀer by a translation of one lattice
unit), and a simple valence-bond picture suggests that
the domain walls between these domains should contain
S = 1/2 spin degrees of freedom—localized spinons—
corresponding to long valence bonds between diﬀerent
domain walls as illustrated in Fig. 1.

Localized spinons were recently observed in a study
combining SDRG, variational, and DMRG calculations
for the J1-J2 chain with disorder added at the special
Majumdar-Ghosh (MG) point J2 = J1/2, where the ex-
act ground state is a doubly-degenerate short-bond VBS
[41]. For a certain type of correlated disorder satisfying
the conditions underlying the MG exact ground state, an
Anderson-type spinon localization mechanism was iden-
tiﬁed at a critical disorder strength. If the MG condition
is violated, the SDRG procedure can generate mixed fer-
romagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, leading to
a partially polarized ferromagnet, as in the “large spin”
phase ﬁrst identiﬁed in Ref. [5].

Unlike the Anderson-localization transition found in
[41], in our model there is no special condition preclud-
ing a transition between the VBS and an AVBS with
spinons at inﬁnitesimal disorder strength, following the
Imry-Ma arguments [42] as applied to gapped Mott insu-
lators turning into gapless Anderson insulators [43, 44].
Thus, for arbitrarily weak disorder, in an inﬁnite chain
there will be some regions favoring one ordering pattern
(singlets or even or odd bonds) and some other regions fa-
voring the other pattern. The typical size of the domains
diverges as the disorder strength vanishes. The resulting
state at ﬁnite disorder should be similar to the one with
domain-wall spinons found in Ref. [41]. However, in that
case it was argued that strong disorder (small VBS do-
mains) will lead to some eﬀective ferromagnetic spinon-
spinon couplings and a partially polarized state. As no
ferromagnetic couplings are generated in the random-Q
model, this system oﬀers opportunities to study a generic
singlet AVBS where the size of the VBS domains can be
tuned from inﬁnity in the clean system down to small
lengths where the picture of VBS domains and domain
walls breaks down. In a J-Q model, the ratio J/Q fur-
ther oﬀers the possibility to also tune the strength of the
dimer order in the domains and the (related) spinon lo-
calization length. Here we focus on the Q model, which
has strong VBS order in the clean limit, adding disorder

FIG. 4. (Color online) SDRG and QMC results for the spin
(a) and dimer (b) correlations in the random-Q model. The
functional forms ﬁtted to the data (curves shown) are the
same as in the corresponding cases in Fig. 3.

according to the distribution (1).

Looking at the QMC spin correlations of the Q-model
graphed in Fig. 4(a), there is ﬁrst a rapid decay, followed
by a plateau, after which the asymptotic decay is con-
sistent with the same r−2 form with multiplicative log
correction found in the random-J model. The SDRG re-
sults show a diﬀerent short-distance behavior, but again
the asymptotic form is r−2. It is not surprising that the
SDRG method cannot fully capture the correlations at
short distance, since it is expected to become accurate
(in an RS state) only gradually as the process ﬂows to-
ward the RS ﬁxed point.
It is nevertheless interesting
to see that the behavior is quite diﬀerent from that in
the random-J model, where a behavior very close to r−2
sets in already at the shortest distances. Both the SDRG
and QMC calculations support the notion that there are
localized spinons in the AVBS, which form a gapless ran-
dom spin sub-system governed by the RS ﬁxed point.

Next, we analyze the dimer correlations in Fig. 4(b).
In the QMC results the almost ﬂat plateaus at short dis-
tances reﬂect the presence of ordered VBS segments, with
a typical length (size of the plateau) which depends on
the disorder distribution. Beyond the plateau, the be-
havior is consistent with r−4 decay with a multiplicative
log correction, again fully consistent with the behavior
of the random-J model. The SDRG results at very large
d show r−4 decays with a correction in the form of an
additive higher power. For smaller d the decay appears
faster, but the behaviors for diﬀerent values of d indi-
cate that this is only a cross-over to an r−4 decay with
a very small amplitude, which is hard to study (except
for very large d) because of the small numerical values
(necessitating more than the 1010 samples that we have
used for averages) [21]. The VBS domains of the AVBS

4

for d = 1, 2 are partially captured by the SDRG, though
there is no ﬂat plateau, merely a slower initial decay.

Discussion.—Our SDRG and QMC results show con-
sistently that both the random-J and the random-Q
models are asymptotically governed by the RS ﬁxed
point. Thus, in a J-Q model, we do not expect any
phase transition as a function of the ratio J/Q, unlike
the clean system where there is a dimerization transi-
tion of the same universality class as in the J1-J2 Heisen-
berg chain [20, 37]. For weak disorder and J/Q in the
neighborhood of its critical value in the clean system,
there should be interesting combined eﬀects of the crit-
ical ﬂuctuations and RS physics. Although there is no
phase transition in the sense of asymptotics, the AVBS
can still be considered as a state of matter diﬀerent from
the Heisenberg-RS, because it possesses a length-scale—
that of VBS domains—which is not present at the RS
point alone and which can be made arbitrarily large.

The physics of the VBS and AVBS also applies to spin
chains coupled to phonons.
In the classical limit, any
spin-phonon coupling leads to dimerization (the spin-
Peierls distortion), while at ﬁnite phonon frequency a
critical coupling is required [45–47]. The relationship be-
tween this transition and that in the J1-J2 chain is well
established [48, 49] and the J-Q model provides an al-
ternative to access the same physics [20, 37]. The AVBS
state we have identiﬁed and characterized here should be
relevant to quasi-one-dimensional spin-phonon materials,
e.g., CuGeO3 [50] and TiOCl [51]. RS scaling due to lo-
calized spinons should be detectable using NMR, and it
would then be desirable to also calculate temperature de-
pendent magnetic properties. It may also be possible to
study AVBS-related disorder eﬀects in dimerized phases
of a trapped-ion system [52].

The RS ﬁxed point is exact for the SDRG scheme,
but our ﬁndings of log corrections suggest that systems
treated without approximations ﬂow to this point (un-
der, e.g., increase of the system size or lowering of the
energy scale in an inﬁnite system) slower than expected.
The same leading power laws and log corrections con-
sistently describe the correlations in the random-J and
random-Q models with diﬀerent disorder distributions,
demonstrating a robust universality of the log exponents
characterizing the RS phase.

Properties of the random-singlet phase:
from the disordered Heisenberg chain
to an amorphous valence-bond solid

Y.-R. Shu, D.-X. Yao, C.-W. Ke,

Y.-C. Lin, A. W. Sandvik

In Sec. 1 we present the details of the SDRG method
for the J-Q3 model and discuss the ﬂow of the energy
scale in the decimation procedure. We discuss the diﬀer-
ent contributions to the dimer-dimer correlation function
in a valence-bond state in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3 we discuss mi-
nor disagreements with previously QMC-calculated spin
correlation functions for the random-J model, which are
due to small remaining ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects in data
presented in Ref. [33].

1. The RG procedure for the random-Q chain

The basic idea of a renormalization-group scheme is to
ﬁnd a system’s ground state by successively eliminating
degrees of freedom with high energy. In the SDRG for
a spin model [1–4, 11], in each step of the process we
ﬁnd the maximum of all couplings in the system and lo-
cally calculate the ground state of the associated term in
the Hamiltonian. We then treat the eﬀect of neighbor-
ing terms perturbatively (one can also do this step non-
perturbatively [6], which does not change the asymptotic
behavior). This process yields an eﬀective Hamiltonian
with gradually fewer degrees of freedom and lower en-
ergy. For the antiferromagnets considered here, the ﬁnal
ground state is a product of singlet pairs, i.e., a single
valence-bond conﬁguration.

Here we describe the SDRG procedure for the random

Q-chain with six-spin interactions,

HQ3 = −Xi

QiPi,i+1Pi+2,i+3Pi+4,i+5 ,

(S1)

where Qi > 0 ∀i and Pij = 1/4 − Si · Sj is a singlet pro-
jector acting on spins Si and Sj. During the decimation
process, eﬀective two-site interactions (J-terms) −JPi,j
and four-site interactions (Q2-terms) −QPi,i+1Pi+2,i+3
will be generated; therefore, the RG procedure described
below is valid for a general random J-Q3-chain obtained
by combining HQ3 and the Heisenberg model,

Consider a 6-spin coupling (Q3-term) with coupling
strength Q0 which is the dominant term at some stage
of the RG, i.e. Ω = Q0 sets the RG energy scale. The
ground state of the associated part of the Hamiltonian,

H0 = −Q0PL,L′PM,M ′ PR′,R,

(S3)

is a 6-spin singlet and the excited states are 63-fold de-
generate (which in the basis of bond singlets and triplets
simply follows from the fact that at least one of the sin-
glet projectors give 0 unless they all act on singlets); the
energy gap between the ground state and the excited mul-
tiplet is Ω = Q0. Diﬀerent from the SDRG process on the
standard Heisenberg chain, under the action of the RG
there are here more than two possible neighboring terms
of H0 in the random Q-chain. Below we consider the
eﬀect of all of these cases of interaction terms perturba-
tively. Typically there are several options for which terms
to select for the perturbative treatment to generate the
new couplings, and one can sum the contributions from
all of them or select just the one generating the largest
contribution. We will discuss this aspect of our practical
implementation further below in Sec. 1 d, after ﬁrst dis-
cussing how to generate the perturbative coupling for all
possible cases.

Case (i): The neighboring terms form a pair of Q3-
couplings with outermost bonds at [i, L] and [R, j] where
i and j are nearest neighboring sites to the left and right
spins, SL and SR, respectively, of the 6-spin segment to
be decimated:

H1 = −QPi,LPL′,M PM ′,R′ − Q′PL′,M PM ′,R′ PR,j . (S4)
To obtain a nonzero coupling between Si and Sj, we need
to use second-order perturbation theory since the ﬁrst-
order contribution vanishes. This leads to an eﬀective
coupling:

˜Jij =

QQ′
32Ω

.

(S5)

Case (ii): The neighboring Q3-terms include outermost
bonds at [a′, a] and/or [b, b′] (see Fig. S1), with the pos-
sible eﬀective Hamiltonians being

JiPi,i+1

(S2)

H1 = −QPa′,aPi,LPL′,M − Q′PM ′,R′PR,j Pb,b′ ,

(S6)

or

or

H1 = −QPa′,aPi,LPL′,M − Q′PL′,M PM ′,R′ PR,j ,

(S7)

H1 = −QPi,LPL′,M PM ′,R′ − Q′PM ′,R′PR,j Pb,b′ .

(S8)

HJ-Q3 = −Xi
−Xi

QiPi,i+1Pi+2,i+3Pi+4,i+5 ,

and also for the J-Q2 chain where the Q3 terms are re-
placed by Q2 terms.
In our discussion below, we use
the notation introduced in Fig. S1 to indicate the spins
involved in an RG decimation.

FIG. S1. (Color online) SDRG rules for the Q3 chain. The thick bonds indicate the strongest coupling (a Q3-coupling [top], a
Q2-coupling [middle] or a J-coupling [bottom]) to be decimated; each pair of spins connected to the thick bonds forms singlet.
The decimation procedure leads to an eﬀective coupling between sites i and j.

For all these cases we obtain an eﬀective coupling be-
tween the spins Si and Sj :

˜Jij =

QQ′
32Ω

,

(S9)

and, in addition, the operator −Pa′,a or −Pb,b′ in H1,
which is outside the decimated region [i, j], is converted
to a J-bond of strength Q/16 or Q′/16 to ﬁrst order in
perturbation theory.

Case (iii): The pair of neighboring Q3-terms includes
one Q3-coupling with the outermost bond [i, L] (or [R, j])
and one Q3-coupling with the innermost bond [R, j] (or
[i, L]), i.e.,

H1 = −QPi,LPL′,M PM ′,R′ − Q′PR,j Pb,b′ Pb′′,b′′′ , (S10)
or

H1 = −QPa′′′,a′′Pa′,aPi,L − Q′PL′,M PM ′,R′PR,j . (S11)
To second order we obtain

˜Jij =

QQ′
32Ω

,

(S12)

for an eﬀective coupling between sites i and j, and in
the process to ﬁrst order the operator −Pa′′′,a′′ Pa′,a or
−Pb,b′ Pb′′,b′′′ is converted to a 4-spin Q2-term of strength
Q/4 or Q′/4.

Case (iv): There are certain pairs of neighboring Q3-
terms that do not contribute to eﬀective couplings be-
tween sites i and j, for example, when one of the Q3-term
contains no bond at [i, L] and [R, j], such as
−QPa,iPL,L′PM,M ′ ,
−QPa′′,a′ Pa,iPL,L′,
−QPM,M ′PR′,RPj,b,
−QPR′,RPj,bPb′,b′′ .
There are also cases of operators containing bonds [i, L]
or [R, j] but still give zero contribution to ˜Jij, such as:

H1 = −QPa′′′,a′′ Pa′,aPi,L − Q′PR,j Pb,b′ Pb′′,b′′′ .

(S13)

When part of a neighboring Q-term is decimated (i.e.,
the bonds in the region [i, j] are removed) as explained
above, the surviving part of the Q3 term outside the dec-
imation region will be converted to a 4-spin Q2-coupling
or a two-spin J-coupling. The strength of the surviv-
ing part, obtained in this case via ﬁrst-order perturba-
tion theory, depends on the location of the decimated
part in the region [i, j], where three two-spin singlets at
[L, L′], [M, M ′] and [R′, R] are formed. The general rule
is as follows: in the decimated region a bond-operator lo-
cated between two sites that do not form a singlet (sites
on which no operator in the dominant H0-term acts),
e.g., between sites L′ and M , will reduce the strength
of the surviving part by a factor 1/4 (and, accordingly,
the strength of the surviving part of an operator with
two such bonds will include a factor 1/16), while a dec-
imated bond-operator on a singlet will not modify the
strength of surviving part. For example, a neighboring
Q3-term such as −QPa′′′,a′′ Pa′,aPi,L will be converted to
a Q2-term −(Q/4)Pa′′′,a′′ Pa′,a, while a Q3-term such as
−QPa,iPL,L′PM,M ′ will be converted to −QPa,i. This
truncation rule is applied in cases (ii), (iii), and (iv).

As is apparent from the above discussion, during the
RG procedure eﬀective J-terms and Q2-terms will be
generated in the system; they are either bonds trun-
cated from perturbative Q3-terms, or those eﬀective J-
couplings generated between the neighboring spins of a
decimated Q3-term. These J- or Q2-couplings will also
generate eﬀective ˜Jij when they become perturbative
terms to a dominant Q3-term [cf. cases (i), (ii) and (iii)
above]. We note the following cases:

Case (v): One Q3-coupling and one J-coupling as the
perturbative terms, e.g.,

H1 = −QPi,LPL′,M PM ′,R′ − JPR,j ,

(S14)

where R and j may be arbitrarily distant sites. Up to
second order, we obtain an eﬀective coupling between
sites i and j:

˜Jij =

QJ
32Ω

.

(S15)

Similarly, for the case

H1 = −QPi,LPL′,M PM ′,R′ − Q′PR,jPa,a′′ ,

(S16)

we obtain

˜Jij =

QQ′
32Ω

.

(S17)

Case (vi): One Q2-coupling and one J-coupling as the
perturbative terms, e.g.,

H1 = −QPi,LPL′,M − JPR,j .

(S18)

Exact diagonalization of the block with H0 and H1 shows
the ground state of the block is four-fold degenerate, in-
dicating zero couplings between i and j; Also with a per-
turbation such as

H1 = −JPi,L − J ′PR,j ,

(S19)

we obtain no coupling between i and j. These pertur-
bative terms are simply removed (see Sec. 1 f for further
discussion of rare special cases where all eﬀective cou-
plings vanish).

b. Q2-decimation

Consider a Q2-term which is the dominant term at
some stage of the RG. The ground state of the associated
part of the Hamiltonian,

is embedded in a Q3-coupling −QPi,LPL′,R′PR′,j. To
ﬁrst order, the eﬀective coupling between i and j is

3

˜Jij =

Q
16

.

(S22)

c. J-decimation

Here we consider the two cases when a J-term H0 =

−ΩPL,R is the strongest coupling at some step of RG.
Case (i): One Q-term such as

H1 = −Q Pi,L PR,j ,

H1 = −Q Pi,L PR,j Pb,b′ ,

or

or

H1 = −Q Pa′,a Pi,L PR,j ,

as a perturbation. To ﬁrst order, we obtain

˜Jij =

Q
4

.

(S23)

(S24)

(S25)

(S26)

H0 = −Q0PL,L′PR′,R,

(S20)

Case (ii): The perturbative terms constitute a pair of
J-couplings:

is a 4-spin singlet and the excited states are 15-fold de-
generate; the energy gap between the ground state and
excited multiplets is Ω = Q0. Below we list the pertur-
bative terms which generate eﬀective couplings between
the neighboring spins Si and Sj :

Case (i): The neighboring perturbative terms constitute
a pair of Q-couplings (Q3 or Q2) with strength Q and
Q′, and at least one of the coupling does not contain the
innermost bond at [i, L] or [R, j] (which is equivalent to
a J-coupling at [i, L] or [R, j]). For this case, to second
order we obtain an eﬀective coupling

H1 = −JPi,L − J ′PR,j .

(S27)

This is an RG decimation for the standard Heisenberg
chain, in which an eﬀective coupling

˜Jij =

JJ ′
2Ω

.

(S28)

is generated. Similarly, if the perturbative terms consti-
tute a pair of Q-couplings such as

H1 = −QPa′′′,a′′ Pa′,aPi,L − Q′PR,jPb,b′ Pb′′,b′′′ ,

(S29)

˜Jij =

QQ′
8Ω

.

(S21)

the eﬀective coupling is

between sites i and j. The bonds outside the region
[i, j] will be converted to Q2 or J-couplings, following
the truncation rules discussed after Case (iv) of the Q3-
decimation. The same result holds when one coupling of
the perturbative terms is a J-coupling and one coupling
is a Q3 or Q2-coupling that is not equivalent to a J-term.

Case (ii): The dominant Q2-term H0 = −QPL,L′PR′,R

˜Jij =

QQ′
2Ω

.

(S30)

Also, with one Q-coupling and one J-coupling as a per-
turbation, we obtain

˜Jij =

QJ
2Ω

.

(S31)

d.

Implementation

In our numerics, we use the maximum rule in the re-
cursion relations for generating the eﬀective coupling ˜Jij
(or Q-bonds) between sites i and j:

ln( ˜J ′

ij ) ≈ max(cid:2)ln(J old

ij ), ln(Jij )(cid:3)

(S32)

where ln(J old
ij ) is a pre-existing coupling between i and
j. We have compared the results with those obtained
by using the sum rule, in which we sum the newly gen-
erated coupling and the pre-existing coupling to obtain
the eﬀective coupling. We have found no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between the results. The maximum rule is also
applied when selecting the pairs of neighboring opera-
tors that would contribute to the eﬀective J-coupling
between the same sites when an operator is decimated
(according to the diﬀerent cases discussed above) if there
are several possible contributing cases. The operator-pair
or single operator that will generate the strongest eﬀec-
tive J-coupling is selected as the perturbative term; all
other operators that are not selected for the generation
of the eﬀective couplings will also be modiﬁed (truncated
to shorter bonds or removed), along with the selected op-
erators, using the RG rules.

The advantage of using the maximum rule is that,
working in terms of logarithmic variables makes it possi-
ble to treat extremely small eﬀective couplings occurring
in a near-singular distribution. The maximum rule is also
in the general spirit of the SDRG approach, where the
ﬂow is toward a singular distribution of couplings and the
sum of contributions generated in the decimation steps
becomes increasingly dominated by the maximum con-
tribution as the RG ﬂows toward the ground state.

e. Energy scale in the SDRG

Since the decimation procedure applied in the SDRG
is an approximation relying on the ﬂow toward a singu-
lar coupling distribution, the method is in general not
suitable for studying systems where the quenched disor-
der is irrelevant in the renormalization-group sense. For
systems governed by strong disorder, the approximation
made in perturbation calculations and the “freezing” of
degrees of freedom becomes inconsequential in the long-
distance limit; this is, in essence, because these systems,
when studied at ever larger length scales (lower energy),
appear more and more disordered. The RS state, which
is the SDRG solution for the approximate ground state
of the random Heisenberg chain (as well as the random
XX-chain), is a prominent example for extremely strong
randomness, called inﬁnite randomness ﬁxed-point solu-
tions; it is characterized by unconventional dynamic scal-
ing given by

spins under the action of the RG (thus, n = 2/N at the ﬁnal
step). Asymptotically the curves for the both models tend to

conventional power-law scaling,
ξt ∼ ξz .

(S34)

with a ﬁnite dynamic exponent z < ∞. In SDRG, the
dynamic scaling behavior can be identiﬁed, for example,
by examining the RG ﬂow of the logarithmic energy scale
ln(Ω); here the energy scale is the strongest eﬀective cou-
pling at each step of RG.

Fig. S2 shows the RG evolution of the log-energy scales
for the random Q3-chain and the random Heisenberg
chain, both with initial chain length N = 8192 and dis-
order strength d = 1. For the both cases, the log-energy
scale tends to a power-law relation with the number NΩ
of the active spins (the spins that are not yet decimated
at a given energy scale Ω), as

− ln(Ω) ∼ N −1/2

,

(S35)

corresponding to a non-power-law dynamic scaling given
in Eq. (S33) with ψ = 1/2 and an inﬁnite dynamic expo-
nent z → ∞, as predicted for an RS state [3].
The convergence of the energy scale for the random Q-
chain in Fig. S2 is slower than for the random-J chain.
Furthermore, the evolution for the random Q-chain ex-
hibits an interesting three-stage structure, which corre-
spond to predominant Q3-decimation in the early stage,
mixed Q2- and J-decimation in the intermediate stage,
and predominantly J-decimation in the late stage.

In comparison to the RS phase in the random XX chain
[11], the energy-length relation for the random Heisen-
berg chain shows slower convergence to the ﬁxed-point

coupled to each other. The orange (gray) rectangular regions
indicate blocks of Q-terms that are active (decimated). The
black curves are eﬀective J-couplings. When the active Q-
terms are to be decimated, no eﬀective coupling will be gen-
erated according to the decimation rule; thus the two spins
(indicated by circles) are left unpaired.

solution given in Eq. (S35) due to the factor 1/2 in the
recursion relation Eq. (S28), which is missing in the cor-
responding recursion relation for the XX-chain [3]. For
the random Q-chain studied here, the recursion relations
are more complex and factors like 1/32 appear in the ef-
fective couplings; therefore the convergence is even slower
than for the random J case.

f. Unpaired spins

We have noticed that there is a small fraction of un-
paired spins in the approximate ground states of long
random Q-chains. The cause for those unpaired spins
is the zero eﬀective couplings in some cases of the
Q3-decimation; for example, when a Q3-term is deci-
mated and the perturbative terms are solely a pair of
J-couplings [see Case (vi) in the Q3-decimation proce-
dure]. Fig. S3 shows an example of such unpaired spins.
Since the ground state of the Q-chain must be a spin-zero
state, the rare unpaired spins are certainly in a singlet
state with a weak bond which is ignored in the pertur-
bative RG procedure.
In short chains (N . 200), we
do not observe such unpaired spins. For longer chains
where they do appear, one reasonable way to account for
them is simply to pair them up into singlets, to ensure
that the ground state on which we compute correlation
functions is a singlet. We have detected no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between correlation functions computed with
these singlet pairings and with the unpaired spins left in
the system, which demonstrates that they do not play
any signiﬁcant role in practice.

2. Dimer correlations

The approximate ground state of the random Q-chain
as well as the random Heisenberg chain resulting from
the SDRG is described by a single set of bipartite valence
bonds with no bonds crossing each other. We denote such
a state by

|vi =O(i,j)

|(i, j)i ,

(S36)

where

|(i, j)i =

1
√2

(|↑i↓ji − |↓i↑ji)

5

(S37)

is the singlet state of two spins i, j in diﬀerent sublattices.
The non-crossing states constitute a complete subset of
the overcomplete full valence-bond basis. For our discus-
sion below, the non-crossing aspect is not crucial but it is
important that the ground state corresponds to a single
bond conﬁguration, not a superposition.

a. Expressions for spin and dimer correlations

The singlet projector Pi,j acting on two spins in a

valence-bond state gives

Pi,j |··· (i, j)···i = |··· (i, j)···i ,

(S38)

1
2 |··· (i, j)(i′, j′)···i .

Pi,j |··· (i′, i)(j, j′)···i =
Another important property of the valence-bond state
is non-zero overlap hv′|vi 6= 0 between any two valence-
bond states. The overlap can be determined in terms of
the total number of loops N◦ in the transposition graph
formed when the bond conﬁgurations of the two states
are superimposed, giving

hv′|vi = 2N◦−N/2

(S39)

for N -spin valence-bond states. In the SDRG case of a
single bond conﬁguration constituting the ground state
we have |vi = |v′i and then N◦ = N/2 and, naturally,
hv′|vi = 1.
From Eqs. (S38) and (S39) we obtain the expecta-
tion value of the two-spin operator Si · Sj in a bipartite
valence-bond state is given by

hv|Si · Sj|vi =
=(− 3

4 ,

0,

1
4 − hv|Pi,j|vi
if i, j are connected by a bond,
if i, j are not connected,

(S40)

which replaces the rule for a general matrix element
hv′|Si · Sj|vi, where the contribution is ±3/4 (depend-
ing on the sublattices corresponding to i, j) for spins be-
longing to the same transition-graph loop. Note that the
SDRG spin correlation function for even r = |i − j| van-
ishes because all the bonds are of odd length.
For a given state |vi the spin-spin correlation C(r) is
obtained by averaging hv|Si · Sj|vi over all i for two spins
separated by a distance r. This correlation is then aver-
aged over many diﬀerent disorder realizations.

The dimer correlation D(r) we consider in this paper is
a 4-spin correlation described by the operator BiBj with
Bi = Si · Si+1 and r = |i − j|. For a general case, the
matrix elements hv′|BiBj|vi have ﬁnite values for four

diﬀerent situations depending on the loop-structure in
the transition graph of the overlap hv′|vi [25, 26]. Using
a notation where sites enclosed by () belong to the same
loop, the four types of site-loop-structures are: (a) (i, i +
1, j, j + 1); (b) (i, i + 1)(j, j + 1); (c) (i, j)(j + 1, i + 1);
(d) (i + 1, j)(i, j + 1), and we also illustrate these cases
in Fig. S4. A complete formula for hv′|BiBj|vi can be
found, e.g., in Ref. [26]. In our single bipartite valence-
bond state |vi and for the four sites all diﬀerent, the cases
(a) and (c) are excluded we just need to consider cases
(b) and (d).

Case (b) corresponds to a state with the following bond

conﬁgurations:

|vbi = |··· (i, i + 1)··· (j, j + 1)···i ,

for which we can apply the formula in Eq. (S40) and
obtain

FIG. S5. (Color online) Contribution to the dimer correlation
from the loop case labeled (d) in Fig. S4 at the largest distance
for the random J chain (a) and the random Q chain (b) with
diﬀerent disorder strength d. Each data point was obtained by
averaging over more than 104 disorder realizations. The solid
lines indicate a power-law decay as N −6, showing consistency
with an asymptotic distance dependence ∝ r−6 for large d.

The single-loop contribution, which is labeled (a) in
Fig. S4 and is absent in the SDRG ground state, is likely
the most important source of the discrepancy between
the SDRG and QMC-data at short distances in Fig. 4(b)
in the main paper, including the plateau due to the pres-
ence of long VBS segments.

b. Asymptotic forms

Using SDRG we have observed that the main contribu-
tion to the staggered component D∗(r) is the short-bond
contribution in Eq. (S42), Fig. S4(b), which gives rise to
the r−4 decay form, both in the random J and random
Q chains. The contribution from Eq. (S44), Fig. S4(d),
where one or both bonds can have length longer than 1,
decays with a higher power, approximately as r−6 in the
strong-disorder limit. We graph the behavior of this term
for several systems in Fig. S5.

TABLE I. Numerical values of the spin correlation function
C(r) = (−1)rhSiSi+ri at r = N/2 for the random-J model
with d = 1, averaged over the reference location i and disor-
der realizations. The results in this work were obtained using
ground-state projector QMC calculations, while those from
Ref. [33] were computed using ﬁnite-temperature QMC cal-
culations at low temperatures (and adjusted by a factor 3/2
to account for diﬀerent deﬁnitions). The numbers in paren-
theses indicate the statistical error (one standard deviation)
of the preceding digit.

We also comment on the diﬃculties in observing the
expected asymptotic r−4 decay in the random-Q model
for small d in Fig. 4(b) in the main paper. Considering
the 3-stage evolution of the energy scale in the RG
process demonstrated by Fig. S2 for d = 1, the dimer
correlations should also be sensitive to these three SDRG
stages. Unfortunately, due to the very small values of
the correlation functions and associated large relative
statistical ﬂuctuations [D∗ deﬁned in Eq. (2) contains
positive and negative contributions which almost cancel

7

each other], we are only able to compute the dimer
correlation to high precision in short chains, typically
using at least 1010 random coupling samples. Therefore,
we only reach the early RG stage, which shows a
fast decay for small d. With larger d, the ﬁnal stage
truly reﬂecting the RS ground state can be reached.
It can be noted here again that the spin correlations
are only sensitive to the bond-length distribution,
which converges relatively fast, while the dimer corre-
lations depend on long-distance bond-bond correlations.

3. Tabulated spin correlations

The disorder-averaged spin correlations were previ-
ously calculated using ﬁnite-temperature QMC simula-
tions at low temperatures in [33]. Results corresponding
to our d = 1 distribution were shown in Fig. 8 (the W = 1
data set) of Ref. [33]. To account for diﬀerent prefactors
in deﬁnitions, the results there should be multiplied by
3/2 to match our results in Fig. 3. At ﬁrst sight, the
results in [33] appear to match well the expected asymp-
totic r−2 form without the log correction we have argued
for and which is required to ﬁt our data in Fig. 3. How-
ever, by comparing with our projector QMC results, we
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant disagreement for the largest system size
(N = 48), which very likely is due to remaining ﬁnite-
temperature eﬀects in the previous calculation. The r−2
behavior does not match well the data if the correct result
for the largest system is used in Fig. 8 of Ref. [33]. The
main conclusion in Ref. [33] regarding cross-over scaling
with coupling distributions not extending to Ji = 0 is
not aﬀected by this issue.

We list the results from Fig. 8 of Ref. [33] alongside our
projector QMC results in Table I. Good agreement within
statistical errors can be seen for all sizes smaller than
N = 48 (note, however, that all other results from [33]
are also slightly below our current values, even though
the deviations are within the error bars). Our error bars
are also signiﬁcantly reduced relative to those in Ref. [33]
and we have extended the range of reliably convergence
considerably, up to N = 144 for d = 1. We include these
results for the beneﬁt of future comparisons with other
calculations.
