Here, we study a crowd model proposed by R. Hughes in [11] and we describe a
numerical approach to solve it. The Hughes model comprises a Fokker-Planck equation
coupled with an eikonal equation with Dirichlet or Neumann data. First, we establish
a priori estimates for the solutions. Second, we study radial solutions and identify
a shock formation mechanism. Third, we illustrate the existence of congestion, the
breakdown of the model, and the trend to the equilibrium. Finally, we propose a new
numerical method and consider two numerical examples.

Understanding the dynamics of pedestrian crowds is of great signiﬁcance, in particular for
the prevention of catastrophic emergency evacuations. Here, we consider an extension of the
PDE model proposed in [11] that describes the evolution of a pedestrian crowd. Our system
of PDEs comprises a continuity equation or Fokker-Planck equation with viscosity ε ≥ 0

and a Hamilton-Jacobi equationρt(x, t) − div(ρ(1 − ρ)2Du) = ε∆ρ,

where ρ : Ω × R+ → R, the density of agents, and u : Ω → R, the exit time, are the
unknowns and the given initial data is ρ(x, 0) = ρ0(x) and u(x) = u0, with x representing
the spatial variable and t the time. Here, Ω is an open domain of Rd and we focus on the
cases relevant in applications, R and R2. The Fokker-Planck equation describes the evolution
of the crowd density ρ (0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1), while the Eikonal determines the optimal direction of
movement for each individual/agent if they assume that the rest of the population is frozen.
The constraint ρ ≤ 1 corresponds to the maximal density of the population. The Dirichlet
condition corresponds to the areas on the boundary where agents/people/pedestrians can
leave. The Neumann condition corresponds to a no-ﬂow condition at the boundary. The
correct interpretation of these boundary conditions is essential in the design of numerical
schemes. The case ε = 0 is the model introduced in [11].

Signiﬁcant progress has been achieved in the understanding of these problems ([1], [7],
[2], [8]). However, even some aspects of one-dimensional models are not completely under-
stood. Microscopic [5, 6] and mean-ﬁeld game [3, 12] interpretations were used to study
the macroscopic dynamics that the Hughes model describes. Numerical approaches to these
problems were developed in [4, 9].

Here, we establish new a priori estimates for solutions of (1) that give a partial regularity
for the solutions. Then, we consider a radial problem to examine the behavior of the model
in two dimensions in a simpliﬁed setting. We show that, when ε = 0, the model admits

shocks, which we also illustrate numerically. Next, we study a one-dimensional problem,
the ﬂow problem. Here, agents arrive at a prescribed rate, that we call current, on one side
of an interval and leave through the other side. We show that, in certain circumstances,
the Hughes model may not be well-posed as the density ρ exceeds the maximal congestion
threshold. In these examples, we identify two mechanisms of loss of regularity: shocks in
the zero-viscosity problem and congestion in the ﬂow problem. Finally, we discuss a new
numerical method for (1) and illustrate the trend to equilibrium and two numerical examples.

2 Estimates

As a ﬁrst attempt to understand the existence of solutions to the Hughes model, we investi-
gate a priori estimates; that is, estimates that are valid for smooth enough solutions. These
estimates extend some of the results in [10] for the periodic setting. First, for the Neu-
mann or Dirichlet boundary conditions and ε > 0, we prove that smooth solutions satisfy
0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 for all times, if the initial condition also satisﬁes this condition. This should be
contrasted with the ﬂow problem considered in Section 4. Next, we prove that Du ∈ Lp, for
1−ρ ∈ Lp. This last estimate gives a quantitative control on the
any 1 < p < ∞, and then 1
congestion. Here, in contrast, we consider the Hughes model in an open domain, Ω ⊂ Rd,
with Dirichlet-Neumann conditions: ∂Ω = Γd ∪ Γn, ν the outer unit normal to ∂Ω, ρ = 0 in
Γd × [0, T ], ρν = 0 in Γn × [0, T ] and viscosity ε = 1.

Lemma 1. Let ρ : Ω × [0, T ] → R solve

ρt − div(ρ(1 − ρ)g(x, t)) = ∆ρ.

Then, 0 ≤ ρ(x, t) ≤ 1, if 0 ≤ ρ(x, 0) ≤ 1.

Proof. Note that ˜ρ = 1 − ρ satisﬁes

˜ρt − div(ρ˜ρg(x, t)) = ∆˜ρ.

Because ˜ρ(x, 0) ≥ 0 (and, with Dirichlet boundary data, ˜ρ ≥ 0 in ∂Ω), we have ˜ρ ≥ 0.
Proposition 1. Let (u, ρ) solve (1) with ε = 1. Suppose u = 0 in Γd × [0, T ], uν = 0 on
Γn × [0, T ] and 0 < ρ < 1 at t = 0. Then, for any α < −1

Now, we observe that, on Γn, uν = 0 and, on Γd, we have ρ = 0. Hence, (1−ρ)α+2ρuν = 0
in ∂Ω. Similarly, (1 − ρ)αρν ≤ 0 in Γd and vanishes in Γn. Hence, is also non-positive in
∂Ω. Thus, taking into account that α + 1 ≤ 0, integrating in time, and using Gronwall’s
inequality, we get the desired estimates.

3 Shocks in radial solutions

To understand the behavior of the Hughes model, we consider radial solutions. Thus (1)
becomes a scalar PDE. Thanks to this simpliﬁcation, we identify the formation of shocks in
the zero viscosity problem. We expect shocks to exist in general two-dimensional problems.
Now, we assume radial symmetry corresponding to a model where agents want to get
away from the origin. In dimension d > 1, assume u = u(r, t), where r is the radius. The
eikonal equation in (1) gives that

ur = ± 1
1 − ρ

.

We select the negative root because it corresponds to agents leaving the origin. Because ρ
is radial, ρ = ρ(r, t), we rewrite the Fokker-Planck equation in (1) in polar coordinates and
using the preceding equation, we get

As it is usual for ﬁrst-order nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations, shocks can arise. We
study the shocks, we use the method of characteristics.

dt = −2

r ρ(1 − ρ),

with r0, ρ0(r0) as initial conditions in time zero for r(t) and ρ(t), respectively.

To solve this system of ODEs, we ﬁrst deﬁne V as
V (ρ) = ρ(1 − ρ),

and, analogously, V0(ρ0) = ρ0(1 − ρ0). Next, we rewrite (4) as

The remark implies that C1 = r0(−2ρ0 + 1) and C2 = r0(2ρ0 − 1). Plugging them back

in the expressions for r1(t), r2(t) we obtain:

Thus, the expressions for r1(t) and r2(t) agree and there is no need to consider two separate
regimes. Thus, we get

value of 0.8.

(c) Case 3: ρ0 with support on 0 ≤ r0 ≤ 1.0
and maximum value of 0.4.

Fig. 1: Shocks along the time evolution of three given proﬁles.

Now, we numerically investigate the formation of shocks for the radial Hughes model
without viscosity. We construct three proﬁles for the density ρ0, all of them with support
(corresponding to the values of r0) in [0, 1].

Next, we plot the graph corresponding to r(t) versus ρ(t) for each proﬁle. The diﬀer-
ent colors correspond to the solution at the diﬀerent times. The blue curve in each plot
corresponds to the initial density proﬁle ρ0, see Figure 1.

We observe the formation of shocks in the solutions. These can be seen by observing
that the graph of r(t) versus ρ(t) is not a single-valued function after certain time. In fact,
once a shock happens, the characteristic’s method is not valid and, consequently, the above
expressions for r(t) and ρ(t) lack meaning.

Case 1 and 2 have initial proﬁles with supports of similar size but case 2 presents shocks
in a shorter time. This shows the dependence on the intensity of ρ0; in case 2, ρ0 reaches
0.8, while in case 1 it is not greater than 0.35.

Finally, the presence of shocks in our examples gives the existence of shocks for the
Hughes model in any dimension. We are not aware a proof of this feature in the literature.

4 Flow problem - stationary case

The ﬂow problem is a natural problem in dimension one. It consists of people entering a
domain from one side at a ﬁxed rate and exiting through the other side. If the ﬂow is large
enough, the maximal density ρ = 1 may be achieved as we show in what follows. This
situation illustrates the breakdown of the model.

Consider the one-dimensional ﬂow problem in [0, 1] where agents arrive at x = 0 and
are only allowed to leave through x = 1. By computing ux in the Eikonal equation (1) and
substituting in the Fokker-Planck equation (1), we obtain
ρt + ρx(1 − 2ρ) = ε ρxx.

The corresponding stationary equation is

We can then formulate the stationary ﬂow problem as:

(cid:40)

ερx + ρ2 − ρ = j,
ρ(1) = 0,

x ∈ [0, 1],

(11)

where j is a prescribed net current of agents entering the domain.

Our interest is to understand the behavior of the solutions of (11) as the current j
becomes large; that is, a large ﬂow of agents. By solving numerically the ODE (11), for
ε = 1 and j between 0 and 1.5, with increments of 0.1, we observe the diﬀerent solutions
for ρ. For j > 1.2, the density ρ is larger than one and thus the model breaks down, see
Figure 2a.
This is remarkable because solutions of the reduced equation (11) are C∞, however, in

the original model the equations become singular.

Now, in Figure 2b, we depict the eﬀect of a small viscosity (ε = 0.01) for a range of
admissible currents (the ones avoiding ρ > 1). We call the current for which the model stops
to work of critical current.

Dependence on viscosity

Here, we investigate the dependence of the viscosity on the solutions. In Figure 3a, we see
that, for small viscosity, the model breaks down. However, large viscosity seems to have a
stabilizing eﬀect. In Figure 3a, we used a current with a ﬁxed value j = 0.5 and viscosities
from 0.3 to 1.5 with increments of 0.1.

Fig. 5: Stationary and time-dependent solutions.

For j = 0.2, the diﬀerent solutions for the density ρ show an upper bound when using

diﬀerent viscosities (from 0 to 0.1 with increments of 0.02), see Figure 3b.

To better understand the relation between viscosity and the critical current, we solve the
ODE (11) with diﬀerent viscosities and compute the critical current for which the density
reaches one. At this density, the model breaks down as shown in Figure 4.

5 Trend to equilibrium

We investigate the relation between the solution to the stationary problem (11) and the
time-dependent one (10). The numerical solution to the stationary problem is calculated
using an ODE solver. Now, the solution to the time-dependent case is computed using the
numerical approach we describe in Section 6. As an example, we solve the problem with the
following initial/boundary conditions, and ε = 0.05:

ρ(0, t) = −0.2(1 − e−10t),

ρ(1, t) = 0,
ρ(x, 0) = x2(1 − x)2.

For large times, the stationary solution is an upper bound to the time-dependent one (the
transient time where this behavior fails is due to the initial condition). This behavior is
depicted in Figure 5a. The time-dependent solution is the ﬁlled graph while the plot of the
stationary one is depicted with wire mesh.

The second aspect we observe is the trend to equilibrium of the time-dependent solution
in the subcritical case, Figure 5b. We are not aware of any proof or theoretical result on the
asymptotic behavior of this problem.

6 Numerical approach

Here, we describe a numerical approach to the Hughes model. Because the Fokker-Planck
equation is the adjoint of the linearization of a new Hamilton-Jacobi equation, we can use
known methods for Hamilton-Jacobi equations to construct automatically schemes for the
Fokker-Planck equation as we illustrate here.

7

0.20.40.60.81.01.21.4ϵ0.40.60.81.01.21.41.6jTo solve the Hughes model, we must use numerical methods that discretize Du in a
consistent way for both equations. Our approach is the following: because the Fokker-
Planck equation in (1) is the adjoint of the linearization of the nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi
operator

− ut + (1 − ρ)2 |Du|2

− ε∆u,

(12)

we can treat both equations, this new Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the original Eikonal
equation, via the same numerical method for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, for instance, using
a monotone scheme.

In the examples discussed in the next section, we use a semi-discretization in space and
treat the time variable as continuous (using a backward diﬀerence formula stiﬀ solver for
the time evolution).

Let h be the mesh size, xn the grid points and un, ρn be the corresponding node values of
u and ρ. The non-linear operator in the Eikonal equation in (1) at a point xn is discretized
through the monotone scheme

Nn(u) ≡ max{un − un−1, 0}2

The operator (12) is discretized as

˜Nn(u) ≡ (1 − ρn)2

The numerical scheme is given as(cid:40)

N (u) = 0,
ρt + (Du ˜N (u))T ρ = 0.

Thanks to this adjoint structure, the second equation is discretized automatically using
symbolic calculus. This approach is valid in arbitrary dimension and, by construction, has
properties such as conservation of mass and positivity.

7 Numerical examples

Now, we use the numerical approach from the previous section and present two examples.
The ﬁrst one deals with agents/people/pedestrians with the possibility of evacuating an
one-dimensional domain from both sides. In the second example, we impose a current of
agents entering the domain and we include reﬂecting boundary conditions on one of the
sides of the one-dimensional domain.

7.1 Example 1

For the ﬁrst numerical example we solve the Hughes model with a low viscosity ε = 0.01,
and the following initial/boundary conditions:



ρ(0, t) = 0,
ρ(1, t) = 0,
ρ(x, 0) = 0.9 sin2(3πx),
u(0, t) = 0,
u(1, t) = 0.

These boundary conditions correspond to the exit problem. Agents have an initial distri-
bution ρ(x, 0) and seek to leave the interval [0, 1] by either x = 0 or x = 1. We plot the
density ρ and the solution u of the Eikonal, corresponding to the exit time, in Figure 6.

7.2 Example 2

The second example is the ﬂow problem for

ρ(1, t) = 0,

ρ(x, 0) = 0.4 sin2(3πx),
u(x, 1) = 0.

In addition, at x = 0, we impose for ρ a ﬂow-one condition:

ρ(1 − ρ)2Du + ερx = 1,

and, at x = 0, we impose reﬂecting boundary condition for u. Here, we use a higher
viscosity, ε = 0.1 and present our results in Figure 7.

8 Conclusions

Here, we develop new a priori estimates for the Hughes model, which are an important step
in understanding the wellposedness of the system for ε > 0.

Next, we use radial solutions to prove the existence of shocks in dimension greater than
one. Consequently, the Hughes model without viscosity may fail to have smooth solutions.
Then, we uncover a new mechanism for the breakdown of classical solutions in the
ﬁxed current problem. Here, the critical density is reached without loss of regularity in ρ.

9

Moreover, we examine the dependence of the critical current on the viscosity, and we present
numerical evidence for the existence of a long-term limit.

Finally, we describe a new method for the approximation of the Hughes model. Our
method combines, in a novel way, monotone schemes for Hamilton-Jacobi equations with
the adjoint structure of the Fokker-Planck equation, and applies to a wide range of related
problems.
