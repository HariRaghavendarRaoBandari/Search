The hyperﬁne splitting of the ground and low-energy 3/2+(7.8 ± 0.5 eV) levels in the 229Th
229Th)∗ has been calculated considering the distribution of the
nucleus in muonic atom (µ−
nuclear magnetization in the framework of collective nuclear model with the wave functions of the
Nilsson model for the unpaired neutron. It is shown that (a) the hyperﬁne splitting of the 3/2+
isomeric state is anomalously weak, and the reduction of hyperﬁne structure in comparison with
the model of a point nuclear magnetic dipole is close to 100%, (b) partial inversion of levels of
the 229Th ground-state doublet and spontaneous decay of the ground state with excitation of the
isomeric state take place, (c) the energy of the isomeric transition lies in the range of 120–140 eV,
which makes possible the direct observation of the transition, registration of conversion electrons
and measurement of the nuclear matrix element.

PACS numbers: 23.20.Lv, 36.10.Ee, 32.10.Fn

The unique transition between the low-lying isomeric
level 3/2+(Eis = 7.8 ± 0.5 eV) (its energy is measured
in [1]) and the ground 5/2+(0.0) state in the 229Th nu-
cleus draws attention of specialists from diﬀerent areas
of physics. The reason is the anomalous low energy of
the transition. Its proximity to the optical range gives
us a hope for a number of scientiﬁc breakthroughs that
could have a signiﬁcant impact on technological develop-
ment and applications. This is a new metrological stan-
dard for time [2–4] and a laser at nuclear transition in
the VUV range [5]. The relative eﬀect of the variation
of the ﬁne structure constant e2 (we use the system of
units  = c = 1) and the strong interaction parameter
mq/ΛQCD [6] are also of considerable scientiﬁc interest.
Finally, we mention the decay of the isomeric nuclear
level via the electronic bridge [7], high sensitivity of the
nuclear transition to the chemical environment and the
ability to use thorium isomer as a probe to study the
physicochemical properties of solids [7], the cooperative
spontaneous emission Dicke [8] in the system of excited
nuclei 229Th, accelerated α-decay of the 229Th nucleus
via the isomeric state [9], and others.

Unfortunately, all attempts to direct observation of the
3/2+(7.8± 0.5 eV) isomeric state decay were not success-
ful (see [10] and references therein). The decay of the
isomer state in the Th atom occurs relatively quickly
through the electron conversion of valence shells [11].
However, it is extremely diﬃcult to ﬁnd this decay be-
cause of very small energy (some units of eV) of the
conversion electrons.
[9, 12] it was suggested
to study the isomeric transition inside dielectrics with
a large band gap. Since there is no conversion decay
channel in such dielectric, the nucleus can absorb and
emit the VUV range photons directly, without interac-
tion with the electron shell. So far however the method
has not lead to a successful result [10].

On the other hand it is well known that nuclear param-
eters like deformation, charge distribution, quadrupole
moments, and so on can be measured with a high preci-
sion in the muonic atom. The muon on the 1S1/2 atomic
orbit creates a very strong magnetic ﬁeld at the nucleus.
The interaction of this ﬁeld with the magnetic moments
of nuclear states leads to a hyperﬁne splitting of nuclear
levels. In this work we demonstrate that the hyperﬁne
splitting has a number of non-trivial features in the case
of (µ−
229Th)∗. Due to the partial inversion of nu-
clear states (one of the sublevels of the ground state has
a higher energy than the isomeric state sublevels) the
channel of the spontaneous decay of the ground state
5/2+ to the isomeric 3/2+ state opens in (µ−
229Th)∗.
The energy of this transition is tens times greater than
Eis. Thus the registration of the conversion decay chan-
nel and the determination the nuclear matrix element of
the isomeric transition become possible. In addition, the
hyperﬁne splitting of the nuclear isomeric state has been
found very weak. This is a consequence of the structure
of the magnetic moment of the 3/2+ level. This situ-
ation is very unusual and looks promising in regard to
experimental research.

The Fermi contact interaction. Let us consider the sys-
tem (µ−
229Th)∗ which consist of the muon bound on
the 1S1/2 shell of muonic atom and the 229Th nucleus.
The muon in the (1S1/2)1 state results in a strong mag-
netic ﬁeld in the center of the 229Th nucleus [13]. The
value of this ﬁeld is given by the formula for the Fermi
contact interaction (see in [14])

The amplitude ψµ(0) can be calculated numerically by
solving the Dirac equation for the muon on the 1S1/2
shell of the muonic atom with the 229Th nucleus that
has a form of charged sphere:

xg′(x) − b(E + 1 − V (x))xf (x) = 0,
xf ′(x) + 2f (x) + b(E − 1 − V (x))xg(x) = 0,

In Eqs. (2) x = r/R0, where r is the muon coordinate in
the spherical coordinate system, and R0 = 1.2A1/3 fm is
the average radius of the nucleus, b = mµR0, functions
g(x) and f (x) are the radial parts of the large and small
components of the Dirac wave function ψµ(x), E is the
muon binding energy in the units of mµ, V (x) is the
muon potential energy (also in the units of mµ) in the
ﬁeld produced by the nucleus protons. We assume that
the proton density of the nucleus has the Fermi shape

where χ = [0.449 + 0.071(Z/N )]/R0 is diﬀuseness or the
half-density parameter of the proton density Fermi dis-
tribution [15]. The density is normalized by the condi-
0 ρp(x)x2dx = Ze, where Z is the nucleus charge.
The muon wave function is normalized by the condition
0 ρµ(x)x2dx = 1, where ρµ(x) is the muon density
ρµ(x) = g2(x) + f 2(x). The result of calculation of the
muon density is presented in Fig. 1. To evaluate the mag-
netic ﬁeld one can use Eq. (1) with the value of the muon
wave function given by ψµ(0) = Y00(ϑ, ϕ)g(0)/R3/2
,
where Y00(ϑ, ϕ) is the spherical harmonic, and from cal-

culations it follows that g(0) =pρµ(0) = 1.75.

Thus, according to Eq. (1) the magnetic ﬁeld at the
center of the 229Th nucleus is about 23 GT. Interaction of
point magnetic moments of the ground state (µgr = 0.45)
and isomeric state (µis = −0.076) with the magnetic ﬁeld
leads to a splitting of the nuclear levels. The energy of
the sublevels is determined by the formula

The quantum number F takes two values F = I ± 1/2
for the ground and isomeric states and determines the
sublevels energy. The resulting energy values are given
in the Table I.

The hyperﬁne splitting found in the model of the Fermi
contact interaction is very signiﬁcant. However, since the
muon density decreases quickly to the nuclear edge the
obtained values are grossly overestimated.

The distributed magnetic dipole model. The inﬂuence
of the ﬁnite nuclear size on the hyperﬁne splitting was
ﬁrst considered by Bohr and Weisskopf [16]. Later the
eﬀect of the distribution of nuclear magnetization on hy-
perﬁne structure in muonic atoms was studied by Le Bel-
lac [17]. According to their works, in the case of deformed
nucleus the energy of sublevels is given by Eq. (4), where

Eint =Z d3r j(r)A(r),

with the vector potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
A(r) generated by the magnetic moment of the nucleus.
For a system of “rotating with the collective rotational
angular-momentum ℜ deformed core + unpaired neu-
tron with the spin Sn”, vector-potential is determined by
the relation [16, 17]

where ρn(R) is the distribution of the spin part of

gR is the core gyromagnetic ratio. The distributions
ρn(R) and ρm

core(R) are normalized: R d3Rρn(R) = 1,

Here we use the standard nuclear wave function

cleus, and M is the component of I along the direction

As follows from Eqs. (5–6), Eint consists of two parts.
The ﬁrst part is the interaction of the muon with the
external unpaired neutron and the second one is the in-
teraction of the muon with the rotating charged nuclear
core. These energies are calculated in accordance with
formulas from [17].
In our case of the muon interacts
with the nucleus in the head levels of rotational bands
(for such states we have K = I), and two contributions

The ﬁrst term in the square brackets in Eqs. (7) and
0 f (x)g(x)dx = −0.18728, corresponds to the in-
teraction of the muon with a point nuclear magnetic
dipole. The resulting energy sublevels quoted in Table I,
lie close to the values calculated with Eq. (1).

For the unpaired neutron the wave functions ϕK
were taken from the Nilsson model. The structure
of the intrinsic state ϕK of the 229Th ground state
5/2+(0.0) is K π[N nzΛ] = 5/2+[633]. The structure of
the isomeric state 3/2+(7.8 eV) is 3/2+[631] [20]. For
each of these states, the wave function has the form
ϕK = φΛ(ϕ)φΛ,nr (η)φnz (ζ) where the quantum num-
ber nr = (N − nz − Λ)/2, the variables on the axes
ζ = R0pMpωzycosθ, η = R0pMpω⊥ysinθ, the ener-

of the unpaired neutron in the states 5/2+[633] and

in Fig. 1. In our numerical calculations we took into ac-
count the asymmetry of the nucleon wave functions in
Eq. (7), but neglected the small diﬀerence between ωz
and ω⊥.

For the core magnetization we used the classical den-
sity of magnetic moment, ρm

obtained from Eq. (3) by averaging over the angles. Such
quadratic dependence was used in [22]. The normalized

The

resulting scheme of hyperﬁne

splitting for
(µ−
229Th)∗ is shown in Fig. 2. For g-factors of the
ground state we have used values, which are accepted
nowadays: gR = 0.309, gK = 0.128 [23]. The reduc-
tion of hyperﬁne structure in comparison with the model
of point nuclear magnetic dipole is about 55% for the
5/2+(0.0) state.

For calculation of the isomeric state we have taken
gR = 0.309 and gK = −0.29. The gyromagnetic ratio
gK = −0.29 and the magnetic moment µis = −0.076 of
the isomeric state were obtained in [24] from the mean
value |gK − gR| = 0.60 (the values |gK − gR| = 0.59± 0.14
and 0.61 ± 0.10 were measured in [25]). The gyromag-
netic ratio gR = 0.309 ± 0.016 from [23] is determined
with a much higher precision than |gK − gR| for the band
3/2+[631], and existing uncertainty in |gK−gR| is related
exclusively with gK. The sublevels energies as a func-
tion of gK (relative to Eis) are shown in Fig. 3. From
Fig. 3 it follows that in the range −0.30 < gK < −0.29
the 3/2+[631] state has a nonzero magnetic moment,
whereas the hyperﬁne splitting is absent or very weak.
Conversely, the magnetic moment of the isomeric level is
close or equal to zero for gK ≈ −0.206, while the hyper-
ﬁne splitting is relatively large. This somewhat paradox-
ical situation is closely related with the structure of the
magnetic moment of the isomeric state and the behav-
ior of the muon wave function. (Note that in the case

decay µ− → e− + ¯νe + νµ. We now estimate how many
nuclei of 229Th decay from the ground to the isomeric
state during the time of 10−7 s.

The main decay channels of the I πF (E) = 5/2+3(141
eV) sublevel is the transition to the 5/2+2(−198 eV)
ground state sublevel (labeled as 1 in Fig. 2). The tran-
sition is accompanied by the emission of conversion elec-
trons and the 340 eV photons.

According to [27] the radiation width of the M 1 transi-
tion with the energy ω between sublevels can be written
in the form

of a point-like nucleus the hyperﬁne splitting of the lev-
els disappears only when the magnetic moment becomes
zero.)

In the state 3/2+[631] the spin projection of the un-
paired neutron on the nuclear axis of symmetry is pos-
itive. gK is given by the relation 0.6g(s)
n hϕK| ˆSz|ϕKi ≈
gKK, where g(s)
n = −3.826 is the neutron spin gyromag-
netic factor. The matrix element hϕK| ˆSz|ϕKi > 0 [26],
because K = Λ + 1/2. Thus, in the state 3/2+[631]
gK < 0. The magnetic moment of the head level of the
rotational band is deﬁned by µ = (gR + gKI)I/(I + 1).
If gK = gR/I = −2gR/3 = −0.206 for I = 3/2 the mag-
netic moment of the 3/2+(7.8 eV) level is zero. This leads
to mutual compensation of two basic terms [with the fac-
0 f (x)g(x)dx] in the interaction energy in the spin
(7) and orbital (8) parts of the formulas. However, the
hyperﬁne splitting does not disappear. The 3/2+[631]
density of the neutron spin distribution and ρm
core (see
Fig. 1) diﬀer signiﬁcantly from each other. They give
diﬀerent in magnitude contributions to the interaction
energy, which do not cancel each others.

The spin [ρn(3/2+[631]), Eq. (7)] and the core [ρm

core,
Eq. (8)] contributions, being totally diﬀerent in their na-
ture, can become equal only when gK 6= −gR/I. Within
the framework of the considered models, the hyperﬁne
splitting of the state 3/2+(7.8 eV) is absent in the muonic
atom (µ−
229Th)∗ at gK ≈ −0.0298 (see in Fig. 3).
This nevertheless implies a non-zero magnetic moment,
µis = −0.083.
Transitions between sublevels. Both sublevels of the
isomeric state 3/2+(7.8 eV) lie below the ground-state
sublevel I πF (E) = 5/2+3(141 eV). As a result, sponta-
neous transitions to the isomeric level accompanied by
its population become possible.

At the time of the formation of the (µ−

229Th)∗ both
sublevels of the isomeric level are empty, and the ground-
state sublevels are populated approximately equally. The
lifetime of the muonic atom is about 10−7 s for muon

1S1/2

Here µµ ˆσ (µµ = e/2mµ) is the operator of the muon
magnetic moment, µgr(is)µN ˆI/I is the operator of the
nuclear transition between the hyperﬁne components of
the same level with spin I, and µtrµN is the operator of
the transition between the ground and isomeric states.

The formula for the M 1 transitions between the hyper-
ﬁne structure components is derived easily from Eq. (9).
For the our case ji = jf = 1/2, Ii = If = Igr(is),
Fi = Igr(is) + 1/2, Ff = Igr(is) − 1/2 one can obtain
the following expression for the radiation width

This formula coincides with the results of the work [28].
As a result one has the following value for the proba-
bility of radiation transition 1 in Fig. 2: Γrad(M 1, I π =
5/2+, F = 3 → 2) = 1.4 × 10−11 eV.
The internal conversion coeﬃcients have been found
using the code developed in [29] on the basis of known
code in [30], and then advanced in [7]. Muon in
(µ−
229Th)∗ is practically inside the thorium nucleus.
This can be clearly seen from Fig. 1. Electronic shell
perceives the system “muon + Thorium nucleus” as the
Actinium nucleus of charge 89. Therefore, the internal
conversion will take place in the electron shell of the Ac
atom. For the transition 1 in Fig. 2 the internal conver-
sion coeﬃcient is equal to αM1 = 1.3 × 106 with the full
width Γtot(M 1; I π = 5/2+, F = 3 → 2) = 1.8 × 10−5 eV.
This means that the half-life of the sublevel I πF (E) =
5/2+3(141 eV) is less than 2.5 × 10−11 s. Therefore, the
relaxation of this level is completed prior to the muon
absorption or the muon decay.

For the numerical estimations of the radiative width
of the transition 2 in Fig. 2 we express the matrix el-
ement of the operator ˆµtr in Eq. (9) through the re-
duced probability of the nuclear transition B(M 1; Ii →
If ) = (3/4π)|hIfkˆµtrkIii|2/(2Ii + 1) and took the value
of B(M 1; Ii → If ) = 3.64 × 10−2µ2
N obtained in [11].
(The factor 3/4π arises because of the diﬀerences in the

deﬁnition of the transition operators in the atomic [27]
and nuclear [18] physics.)

The

transition I πF (E) = 5/2+3(141 eV) →
3/2+2(Eis + 1.8 eV) has the radiation width Γrad =
0.95 × 10−15 eV. The internal conversion coeﬃcient and
the total width of this transition are αM1=3.8 × 106
and Γtot = 3.6 × 10−9 eV respectively. The value of
Γtot is close to the width of the main channel of the
muonic atom decay — the muon absorption by the nu-
cleus. Thus, the branching factor — the ratio of the
number of the isomeric nuclei 229Thm(3/2+, 7.8 eV) to
the number of muonic atoms (µ−
229Th)∗ — will be
about 2 × 10−4. This means that on modern muon fac-
tories, where the generation of muonic atoms is 105 s−1,
we can expect the formation of the order of 10 isomeric
nuclei 229Thm(3/2+, 7.8 eV) per second.
In promising
muon factories of the nearest future with the muon in-
tensity 1012 s−1 [31] and the generation of muonic atoms
of 108 s−1 the rate will increase to 104 per second.

1S1/2

The internal conversion for the 132 eV transition
I πF = 5/2+3 → 3/2+2 takes place mainly at the elec-
tronic state 6S1/2 with the binding energy of −42 eV.
The conversion electrons from this shell have the energy
of 90 eV, and the are no other electrons in the vicinity
of this value. The matrix element of the transition is ex-
tracted directly from the data on the probability of the
conversion decay. In addition, the measurement of the
parameters of this transition will give indirect informa-
tion about the energy of the isomeric state Eis, and will
be useful for the reﬁnement of the nuclear models.

feature of

Another unusual

the hyperﬁne struc-
ture of the low-energy isomeric state 3/2+(7.8 eV) in
(µ−
229Th)∗ is the optical range for the transition
I πF = 3/2+2 → 3/2+1.
Its energy is about 5 eV in
the framework of the present approach, which gives a
hope that advanced optical methods can be applied for
the study of the features of this extraordinary nuclear
state.

This research was carried out by a grant of Russian

Science Foundation (project No 16-12-00001).
