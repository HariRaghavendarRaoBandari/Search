Abstract: We study kinematic distributions that may help characterise the re-
cently observed excess in diphoton events at 750 GeV at the LHC Run 2. Several
scenarios are considered, including spin-0 and spin-2 750 GeV resonances that de-
cay directly into photon pairs as well as heavier parent resonances that undergo
three-body or cascade decays. We ﬁnd that combinations of the distributions of the
diphoton system and the leading photon can distinguish the topology and mass spec-
tra of the diﬀerent scenarios, while patterns of QCD radiation can help diﬀerentiate
the production mechanisms. Moreover, missing energy is a powerful discriminator
for the heavy parent scenarios if they involve (eﬀectively) invisible particles. While
our study concentrates on the current excess at 750 GeV, the analysis is general and
can also be useful for characterising other potential diphoton signals in the future.

The excess in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum around 750 GeV observed by
ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] in the ﬁrst LHC Run 2 data led to a sheer ﬂood of theory
papers trying to explain the alleged signal.1 The interpretations put forward span a
wide spectrum, including extra Higgs bosons, axions, sgoldstinos, radions, gravitons,
hidden glueballs, hidden- or techni-pions and so on. Typically, the existence of
additional new particles and/or new (strong) dynamics is invoked, in order to account
s = 8 to 13 TeV and to evade the often
for the increase in cross section from
stringent bounds from null results in dijets, monojets and other search channels
both at
s = 8 and 13 TeV. The ﬁrst theory papers discussing various ways to
reproduce the observed diphoton rate as well as possibly a large width while avoiding
existing constraints from Run 1 appeared on the arXiv already on the day after the
announcement of the excess [4–11]. More than 200 papers followed to date.

√

√

1The ATLAS excess consists of 14 events in 3.2 fb−1 of data; it has a local (global) signiﬁcance
of 3.6 σ (2.0 σ) and seems to favour a large width of about 45 GeV (see however [3]). The CMS
excess consists of 10 events in 2.6 fb−1 of data; it has a local (global) signiﬁcance of 2.6 σ (1.2 σ)
and is consistent with a narrow width.

Whatever one may think of this “ambulance chasing” [12], an interesting ques-
tion that arises is how to experimentally diﬀerentiate between this variety of possible
interpretations. Needless to say this question will be of imminent importance should
the observed excess turn into a discovery with the accumulation of more data. One
approach consists of observing the new state in diﬀerent decay modes, as the predic-
tions for the (ratios of) rates of speciﬁc ﬁnal states vary between diﬀerent concrete
models. Another, complementary approach is to rely on the diphoton signal itself
and attempt its detailed characterisation in terms of kinematic distributions. As
a preparatory step in the latter direction, in this paper we study the expectations
for diﬀerential distributions from various signal hypotheses and discuss ways to dis-
criminate between them. We note in passing that both approaches—inclusive mea-
surements in diﬀerent ﬁnal states and kinematic distributions—have been pursued
successfully to scrutinise the 125 GeV Higgs signal in Run 1 [13–25].

Irrespective of the underlying model, the interpretations put forward generically
fall in just a few classes. First, if we are dealing with a new particle with mass of
750 GeV which undergoes a two-body decay into two photons, the classiﬁcation is
by spin and production mechanism. The most straightforward option is a 750 GeV
spin-0 (singlet scalar or pseudoscalar) particle produced in gluon fusion and decaying
to photons e.g. via loops of new vector-like quarks. Bottom-quark (b¯b) initiated
production could also provide the necessary increase in cross section from
s = 8 to
13 TeV of about a factor ﬁve [10]. If it has electroweak couplings, a scalar resonance
can also be produced in vector boson fusion and vector-boson associated production.
Photon-initiated production has also been discussed [26–29].

√

Another option is a spin-2 resonance, like the Kaluza–Klein (KK) graviton in
Randall–Sundrum (RS)-type models [30], which might be produced from gg or q ¯q
initial states. A spin-1 particle would not decay into photons,2 and higher spins
are not considered because they are disfavoured theoretically. In order to explain a
large width, as seemingly favoured by ATLAS, the resonance should couple not only
to gluons and photons (and perhaps quarks) but also to non-standard states such
as dark matter or light hidden-valley particles. Invisible decays are, however, fairly
constrained (although not excluded) by the 8 TeV mono-X searches as discussed e.g.
in [32].

Alternatively, the new particle can be (much) heavier than 750 GeV and undergo
a three-body [33, 34] or a cascade decay [10, 35–38] into two photons along with one
or more light new particle(s). These light new particles would then need to be soft
or invisible so as to avoid detection. Such a scenario could “naturally” explain the
apparent broadness of the diphoton invariant mass peak, as well as soften the tension

2See however [31] for a scenario where a vector resonance decays to a photon and a light scalar,
followed by a decay of the scalar into two highly collimated photons, Z(cid:48) → γ + s → 3γ, which might
appear as a diphoton ﬁnal state.

with the 8 TeV data. Note that in this case the new states can in principle be scalars,
vectors or fermions.

Kinematic distributions for characterising the 750 GeV diphoton excess have
been considered previously in the literature. For example, [39] discussed gg versus
q ¯q initiated production of a spin-0 resonance, while [28, 40–42] discussed kinematic
distributions arising from spin-2 resonances (in part comparing them to the spin-0
case). Reference [28] also discussed how to diﬀerentiate gluon- from photon-induced
production for both spin-0 and spin-2 particles, while the authors of [43] performed
a spin-parity analysis for photoproduction including PDF uncertainties. For the case
of a heavier parent resonance, [35] considered Emiss
and Eγ distributions for various
cascade-decay topologies.

T

In this work we study the kinematic distributions arising from 750 GeV spin-0
and spin-2 resonances and compare them to those obtained from the production of
heavier parent particle(s) that undergo two- or three-body decays. We go beyond the
previous investigations listed above by analysing a consistent set of kinematic distri-
butions for all these diﬀerent cases. Moreover, we employ more realistic simulations
including initial-state QCD radiation and parton shower matching.

We note that the results of our analysis hold regardless of the fate of the 750 GeV
diphoton excess and should provide useful guidelines for the discrimination of other
potential diphoton excesses that could appear during the 13 TeV LHC Run.

The paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we brieﬂy present the scenarios
we will consider and our choices for the parametrisation of the relevant interactions.
Section 3 describes the computational tools we employ for our analysis as well as
some important technical features. Our main results on the kinematic distributions
that could be used to discriminate among diﬀerent explanations of the diphoton
signal are presented in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5. Appendices A and B
contain supplementary considerations on two of the heavy parent scenarios discussed
in the main part of the paper.

2 Scenarios for the 750 GeV diphoton excess

As brieﬂy discussed in the Introduction, the various scenarios for the diphoton excess
can be quite generically classiﬁed according to the number and the nature of the ﬁnal
state particles as well as according to the initial state producing them in the ﬁrst
place. A full survey of all types of models that have been proposed in the literature
is not the scope of our study. Instead, our approach is mostly driven by the diﬀerent
types of topologies that could generate the excess at 750 GeV.

Even so, a choice is to be made for the parametrisation of the relevant inter-

section seemingly favoured by the ATLAS and CMS data [44] would either require
fairly light weakly coupled new physics, mostly likely in tension with observations,

or might be pointing towards some type of strong dynamics or to some relatively
singular threshold eﬀect [45, 46]. In this case, a complete description of the underly-
ing physics is likely to involve some momentum-dependent form factors the form of
which depends on the speciﬁc setup being invoked.

A simpler approach, yet powerful enough to capture the main eﬀects of interest
for our work, is to parametrise the couplings of the new state(s) to the SM ones
in terms of eﬀective operators suppressed by appropriate powers of some eﬀective
ﬁeld theory (EFT) scale Λ.3 Note that the scale Λ does not correspond to the
cutoﬀ scale of the theory: the two are rather typically related to each other, but the
relation depends on the speciﬁc UV-completion. We also note that in everything
that follows we will ignore Lagrangian terms that are not directly relevant to our
analysis, whereas we will remain agnostic to whether the new states introduced in
the eﬀective Lagrangian description are fundamental or composite.

2.1 750 GeV resonance

The simplest way to accommodate the 750 GeV diphoton excess is by invoking
a particle Xs with a mass of 750 GeV that decays into a pair of photons.4 The
Landau-Yang theorem [49, 50] then guarantees that Xs can be a spin-0 particle X0
or a spin-2 particle X2. In either case it can be produced via gluon, q ¯q, photon or
vector boson fusion, or in association with a vector boson or a pair of top quarks.

Out of these cases, we consider gg and b¯b production of a spin-0 resonance,
and gg and q ¯q production of a spin-2 one, as depicted in Fig. 1. Note that gg
and b¯b production are particularly interesting because they yield the highest gain
√
in parton luminosities when going from
s = 8 to 13 TeV, being enhanced by
factors of ∼ 4.7 and ∼ 5.4 respectively as opposed to valence quarks for which
the corresponding factors are of the order of 2.5 [10]. Similarly, in the case of vector
boson fusion, naively assuming that the parton luminosities scale with the quark ones,
one expects an enhancement of roughly a factor 2.7, well below the corresponding
values for b quarks and gluons. Besides, in the spin-0 case, if the new state is
somehow involved in electroweak symmetry breaking, it is expected to couple to the
SM fermions proportionally to their mass and should, hence, interact more with the
third generation than with light-ﬂavor quarks. For a spin-2 resonance, the prime
example is the KK graviton, which has universal couplings to gluons and quarks.
We thus consider gg and q ¯q production for the spin-2 case.

3A discussion and motivation can be found, e.g. in the introduction of [47].
4For the reader who wants to dive into a plethora of realizations within concrete models, [48]

provides an extensive overview together with the actual model implementations.

Spin-2

As an alternative possibility, we also consider a massive spin-2 particle which couples
to the SM gauge and matter ﬁelds through their energy–momentum tensors [51, 52].

photons [41]:

UV model [54, 55]. We consider three cases:

corresponding to the gluon-dominant, universal coupling, and quark-dominant sce-
narios, respectively. These scenarios amount to 99%, 87% and 7% gluon fusion
contributions to the total 750 GeV spin-2 resonance production cross section at the
13 TeV LHC respectively [41].

2.2 Heavier parent resonance

Another way to induce a peak in the diphoton invariant mass distribution is by
invoking more complicated decays or decay chains of a heavier parent particle, leading
to three (or more)-body ﬁnal states.
In this case, one can envisage a number of
diﬀerent topologies. In our study, we consider the following possibilities:

I) A process of the type pp → S3 → S2 + S1, S2 → γγ with S1 being invisible
or leading to soft decay products. Such a scenario could e.g. be motivated by
considering dark matter or “hidden valley” [56] models. In principle S3 can be a
fundamental scalar or vector [10] or a composite particle (Q ¯Q bound state) [4].
II) A 3-body decay scenario with single production of the heavier resonance: pp →
S3 → S1γγ [33], where S1 is again invisible or decays softly. This scenario is
equivalent to the previous one in the limit that S2 is heavy (virtual).

III) A 3-body decay scenario as above but with associated production of S3 and S1:
pp → S3S1, S3 → S1γγ [33]. Such a scenario has the advantage of allowing for
the existence of a new conserved quantum number under which S1 and S3 are
charged, and which would stabilize S1, the lightest state of the new sector.

IV) The “antler” topology from a process of the type pp → S3 → χ2χ2, χ2 → χ1 +γ
as proposed in [35].5 While it is rather diﬃcult to envisage a realistic scenario,
this topology is reminiscent of general gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking
scenarios [57] with a suﬃciently short-lived neutralino NLSP, see e.g. [58].

For concreteness, we concentrate on gluon-initiated production of a CP-even
spin-0 parent resonance. The relevant diagrams are shown in Fig. 2. These scenarios

5Note that in this scenario we take the χi’s to be fermions, as the scalar case cannot be rendered

gauge invariant at the leading operator order unless χ1,2 are mass degenerate.

where in the last (magnetic-type) operator, σµν = i
2 [γµ, γν]. The couplings rele-
vant for each of the scenarios I–IV are summarised in Table 1, together with the
mass combinations that we consider as benchmarks. For simplicity, and regardless
of naturalness arguments, all other couplings are taken to be zero throughout the
subsequent analyses.

In [36] a scenario similar to our scenario I was considered, namely production
of a heavier (pseudo)scalar resonance which decays into a pair of new pseudoscalars
with mass of 750 GeV, which decay further into photons. This would correspond to
scenario I with m2 = m1 and is discussed in Appendix A.

For the antler topology, scenario IV, we note that one has to ﬁnely adjust the
masses of S3 and χ2, and even more so their decay widths, in order to obtain the
desired diphoton invariant mass spectrum. For our simulations, we use Γ(S3) = 0.1
and Γ(χ2) = 0.05 GeV for the antler topology. The sensitivity on the masses and
widths will be commented upon in Appendix B. For scenarios I–III, we use Γ(S3) =
10 GeV, which does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the relevant distributions.

We note that these cases do by no means exhaust all the possibilities for repro-
ducing the 750 GeV excess. For instance, we do not consider scenarios with very light
states decaying into pairs of highly boosted photons which would be misidentiﬁed as
individual photons. Examples for this are pp → Z(cid:48) → γs → 3γ [31] or pp → S → aa,
a → γγ [59–61]. Exhausting all these possibilities is beyond the scope of this work.

3 Event simulations

While we employ the Higgs Characterisation (HC) [47] model for the 750 GeV reso-
nance scenarios,6 we implemented the Lagrangians for heavier parent resonances in
FeynRules [63] to generate the model ﬁles which can be interfaced [64, 65] to event
generators.

We generate inclusive signal samples by using the matrix-element plus parton-
shower (ME+PS) merging procedure.
In practice, we make use of the shower-kT
scheme [66], implemeted in MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [67] with Pythia6 [68], and
generate signal events with parton multiplicity from zero to two, e.g. pp → X0,2 +
0, 1, 2 partons. The merging separation parameter is set to Qcut = 200 GeV for
the 750 GeV resonance scenarios and to Qcut = 200, 250, 300 GeV for the heavier
parent scenarios with m3 = 900, 1200, 1600 − 1800 GeV, respectively. Hadron-level
events are analyzed in MadAnalysis5 [69], where we deﬁne jets by using the anti-kT
algorithm [70] as implemented in FastJet [71] with the jet cone radius R = 0.5.

At the analysis level, we require for the transverse momentum pT and pseudora-

pidity η of the photons and jets

pT (γ) > 25 GeV ,

pT (j) > 25 GeV ,

|η(γ)| < 2.5 ,
|η(j)| < 5

(3.1)

(3.2)

respectively. Moreover, we assume 100% reconstruction eﬃciency for photons and,
when relevant, for b-jets. This is justiﬁed because we are only comparing shapes of
distributions, not overall rates. The mild pT and η dependence of the eﬃciencies can
be neglected for our purpose.

4 Results

4.1 750 GeV resonance

We begin by considering the eﬀect of a narrow vs. broad nature of a 750 GeV res-
onance on kinematic distributions. It turns out that there is very little sensitivity
to the width, the largest eﬀect occurring for the transverse momentum distributions
of the photons illustrated in Fig. 3 for the case of a 750 GeV spin-0 resonance. In
particular, for the leading photon pT (γ1) is more peaked for a smaller width. An
analogous behaviour is observed for the second photon, where for a narrow width,
the pT (γ2) distribution has a sharp cut-oﬀ near mX0/2 = 375 GeV, while for a broad
width there is a larger tail towards higher pT values. All other distributions that we
will consider, including the transverse momentum of the diphoton system, pT (γ1γ2),

6The model ﬁle is publicly available at the FeynRules repository [62]. Although the HC model
is designed to study the spin–parity nature of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, one can easily change its
mass mX0,2 as a parameter.

show very little sensitivity to the width. The picture is essentially the same for a
spin-2 resonance. In the following we will therefore consider only the Γ = 45 GeV
case for 750 GeV resonances and contrast it to the distributions obtained for heavier
parents.

Next, Fig. 4 compares transverse momentum and pseudo-rapidity distributions
of the diphoton system and the leading jet and photon as well as rapidity separation
(∆η) distributions of jets and photons for a spin-0 resonance produced in either
gg (red lines) or b¯b (blue lines) fusion. The blue dashed lines depict the case of
associated production with a b¯b pair, pp → X0b¯b with 2 b-tagged jets. We also show
the number of jets N (j) (or b-jets N (b)). We observe that QCD radiation leads to a
rather hard pT spectrum of the diphoton system, which is zero at the LO, especially
in the gg fusion production case. Moreover, a gluon-induced diphoton resonance
tends to be produced more towards the central region than a b¯b one and involves a
higher jet activity. The distinction between gg and b¯b initiated production can be
further enhanced by requiring 2 b-tagged jets, which changes the distributions for
the b¯b case in a distinct way (for gg production most events would be rejected). It is
clear that the extra jet activity aﬀects the higher tail of the pT of the leading photon.
The dependence of transverse momentum and rapidity distributions on the gg and
diﬀerent ﬂavour q ¯q initial states was discussed in detail in [39].

The distributions in Fig. 4 are insensitive to the CP nature of X0. To distinguish
a CP-even from a CP-odd X0 from the diphoton ﬁnal state, one would need to exploit
the azimuthal angle correlation of extra jets in 2γ + 2 jets events with a vector boson
fusion-like cut on m(jj) and/or ∆η(j, j), analogous to Higgs studies [55, 72–75]. This
is illustrated in Fig. 5 but will require high luminosity to be potentially measurable.
We note that a heavier X0 leads to a smaller ∆φjj oscillation [75], i.e. for the 750 GeV
case it will be more diﬃcult to measure CP eﬀects than for the 125 GeV Higgs.

In Fig. 7 we present the same set of distributions as in Fig. 4 for the case of a spin-2
resonance with mass of 750 GeV (and width of 45 GeV). Here, we compare R = 1
(red), 0.1 (blue) and 10 (green). The gluon-initiated spin-0 case is also shown by
black dotted lines as a reference, for easier comparison with Fig. 4. Note that here we
require the above pmax
(j) cut even for the spin-0 case in order to perform a meaningful
comparison. We see that while q ¯q dominated production diﬀers from gg dominated
production in several of the distributions, most notably the jet activity, distinction
of the gg initiated spin-0 and spin-2 cases is less obvious. This was also observed
for the case of the 125 GeV Higgs characterisation in [47]. There are, however, some
diﬀerences in the heavy resonance decay; indeed most promising for diﬀerentiating
spin-0 from spin-2 are the rapidity separation between the two photons, ∆η(γ1, γ2),
and to some extent the leading photon pT and η distributions [40, 41], simply due to
the diﬀerent decay distributions between the spin-0 and spin-2 resonances.

4.2 Heavier parent resonance

We next contrast the above results to the diﬀerent cases of a heavier parent resonance
described in Section 2.2. To begin with, we show in Fig. 8 (left) the diphoton invariant
mass distributions for the diﬀerent benchmark scenarios from Table 1. We see that
with a precise lineshape analysis one should be able to discriminate the three-body
decay and antler scenarios (II–IV) from the cases where the two photons originate
from a two-body decay of a 750 GeV particle. Even for the diphoton coming from
the 750 GeV resonance (with a 45 GeV width) in scenario I, the lineshape can diﬀer
from the one for direct resonance production (black dashed) depending on m1.

If S1 or χ1 are invisible, an observable that can be more readily exploited with
less data to discriminate the heavier parent from the direct 750 GeV resonance case
is the amount of missing transverse energy, Emiss
, shown in the right panel in Fig. 8.
Depending on the precise mass pattern, the Emiss
distribution may also help to
discriminate between scenarios I–IV. We note that scenarios III and IV as well as
scenarios I with a light S1 and the 3-body decay scenario II with a very heavy parent
all lead to very high Emiss
. While so far ATLAS and CMS have not provided any
details on the event structure of the diphoton excess, such high Emiss
T would have been
a striking feature and diﬃcult to miss. In this respect scenarios I and II with masses

7We note that, unlike the R = 10 (quark-dominant) case, the distributions for R = 0.1 (gluon-
dominant) is very similar to the R = 1 case since the gluon-initiated process is dominant for the
universal coupling case, as mentioned before.

discussed in Sec. 4.1.

To obtain complementary information to the above and/or if S1 or χ1 are not
invisible but lead to soft decay products because of, e.g., a hidden valley cascade,
one can make use of the ‘conventional’ kinematic distributions that we already con-
sidered for the 750 GeV spin-0 and spin-2 resonance cases. These are shown in Fig. 9
for the heavier parent scenarios. While the distributions involving jets oﬀer little
discriminating power, the diphoton pT and η distributions are rather distinct. Con-
cretely the diphoton system is harder and more central depending on the scenario.
Additional information can be obtained from the pT (γ1) spectrum. Putting every-
thing together it seems feasible to distinguish not only between the 750 GeV and
heavier resonance cases but also among the heavier parent scenarios I–IV, although
distinguishing between scenarios I and II is somewhat more involved. Here note that
in the sequential resonance case there are two free parameters, m3 and m1, while
in the 3-body decay case m3 and m1 are tightly related once the mγγ spectrum is
ﬁxed. Comparing scenario I with (m3, m1) = (1200, 440) GeV to scenario II with
m3 = 900 GeV we see that the former leads to a somewhat softer pT (γ1γ2) spectrum,
and pT (γ1) exhibits a notch (on log scale) around 375 GeV.

5 Conclusions

Should the observed excess in diphoton events at 750 GeV turn into a discovery
with the accumulation of more data, the next step will be to elucidate its precise
nature. An immediate question in this context will be whether we are dealing with
the direct production of a new 750 GeV spin-0 or spin-2 particle that decays into
a pair of photons, or with a heavier particle that follows a more complicated decay
pattern with the masses of the involved particles conspiring to give two photons
with an invariant mass spectrum peaking around 750 GeV. The characteristics of
additional activity present in the events, such as the amount of missing energy,
the jet multiplicity, or the presence of b-jets or other particles accompanying the
two photons constitute an important piece of information to this end. On a longer
timescale, one can envisage a detailed characterisation of the diphoton signal in terms
of kinematic distributions.

As a preliminary step towards such a program, in this work we studied kinematic
distributions that may help determine the nature of the putative 750 GeV excess.
Using a simple parametrisation of the underlying interactions, we analysed the pT ,
η and ∆η distributions of photons and jets and the overall jet activity expected for
a 750 GeV spin-0 resonance produced through gg or b¯b fusion, a 750 GeV spin-2 res-
onance produced in gg or q ¯q fusion, and four diﬀerent scenarios for a heavier spin-0
parent produced in gg fusion and undergoing 3-body or cascade decays. We found
that combinations of the distributions of the diphoton system and the leading photon

– 14 –

can help distinguish the topology and mass spectra of the diﬀerent scenarios, while
patterns of QCD radiation can help diﬀerentiate the production mechanisms. More-
over, the presence of missing energy can help disentangle the direct resonance scenario
from the heavy parent one if the latter involves (eﬀectively) invisible particles. In
this spirit, the study of such distributions constitutes a powerful complementary ap-
proach to both, the search for other decay modes of the new state(s) responsible for
the diphoton signal and standard direct searches for additional particles that could
accompany the new state(s).

While our conclusions about the prospects of distinguishing between diﬀerent
topologies are generally optimistic, one has to bear in mind the limitations of the
EFT approach8 that we employed in our analysis. For example, the presence of rel-
atively light new particles in loops (for weakly coupled models) or form factors (for
strongly coupled ones) could bring about some momentum-dependence of the under-
lying interactions, which would distort some of the distributions we have considered.
In this case there should however also be other observable eﬀects, most notably the
eventual detection of additional new particles as the sensitivity of the LHC searches
improves with more data.

The future of the 750 GeV excess remains, of course, unknown. Our results can,
however, also be of relevance for other potential excesses that might be observed
during the LHC Run 2.
In any case, we are eagerly looking forward to the next
round of data-taking that might (hopefully) turn the present excess into a discovery
and thus open the door to a plethora of exciting new physics explorations.

A Sequential resonance with S1 = S2

A special case of the ‘sequential resonance’, i.e. our scenario I given by the left-
most diagram in Fig. 2, is when S3 decays into two identical particles S2 = S1.
This was considered in [36], where the authors studied the production of a heav-
ier (pseudo)scalar resonance decaying into a pair of lighter pseudoscalars with mass

of 750 GeV, which decay further into electroweak SM gauge bosons via the Wess-
Zumino-Witten anomaly. While this case is distinct from the other ‘heavier parent’
cases we considered — the events would contain additional hard particles from the de-
cay of the second S2 (e.g., pp → S3 → S2S2 → γγ + ZZ) which should be observable
— it is interesting to compare the resulting diﬀerential distributions of the diphoton
signal to those of our scenario I benchmark points. This is exempliﬁed in Fig. 10,
where the dotted red line shows the case m3 = 1700 GeV, m2 = m1 = 750 GeV. Note
that we assume exactly two photons; the possibility of the second S2 also decaying
into γγ is ignored. Interestingly, most of the distributions look very similar to those
of the m3 = 1200 GeV, m2 = 750 GeV, m1 = 40 GeV case. The exception is η(γ1γ2),
which is more central and does not exhibit any dip at η = 0.

B Mass and width eﬀects for the antler topology

While the ‘heavier resonance’ scenarios I–III can reproduce the observed diphoton
excess in a rather generic manner, scenario IV (the so-called antler topology) is
subject to some ﬁne-tuning. First of all, as already noted in [35], obtaining the

desired diphoton invariant mass spectrum requires a ﬁne adjustment of m1, m2 and
m3. The interrelation between the three masses to obtain the correct endpoint is
illustrated in Fig. 11 (left). While a priori this does not look too constraining, the
additional requirement that the cut-oﬀ in mγγ be steep enough is a very severe
constraint, pushing m2 extremely close to m3/2: the 1σ range from the ﬁt in [35] is
above the blue line in Fig. 11 (left).

Related to this, we observe moreover a strong sensitivity to the decay widths.
This is illustrated in Fig. 11 (right), where we compare the mγγ spectrum of the
benchmark point (m3, m2, m1) = (1700, 849, 175) GeV obtained with Γ3 = 2Γ2 =
0.1 GeV (as used in Figs. 8 and 9) to that obtained with somewhat larger but still
narrow widths of Γ3 = 2Γ2 = 1 GeV. We see that mγγ quickly ﬂattens out. Also
shown for comparison is the resulting mγγ spectrum when changing m2 from 849 GeV
to 845 GeV (i.e. m2/m3 = 0.497 instead of 0.499). Here the dependence on the width
is less dramatic, as we are a bit further away from the threshold. However, mγγ is
already too ﬂat to provide a good explanation for the observed excess.
