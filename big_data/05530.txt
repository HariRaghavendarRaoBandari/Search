Abstract. The extension of the Dirac Delta distribution (DD) to the complex ﬁeld
is needed for dealing with the complex-energy solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation,
typically when calculating their inner products. In quantum scattering theory the DD
usually arises as an integral representation involving plane waves of real momenta.
We deal with the complex extension of these representations by using a Gaussian
regularization. Their interpretation as distributions requires prescribing the integration
path and a corresponding space of test functions. An extension of the Sokhotski-
Plemelj formula is obtained. This deﬁnition of distributions is alternative to the historic
one referred to surface integrations on the complex plane.

Complex Dirac Delta

1. Introduction

2

We consider 1-dimensional quantum barriers of compact support, often referred to as
cut-oﬀ potentials, and the solutions to the corresponding time-independent Schr¨odinger
equation. Besides the real-energy solutions, namely the bound states (negative discrete
spectrum) and the scattering states (positive continuum spectrum) or ”Dirac kets”, of
well-known physical meaning, there exists a much larger set of complex-energy solutions.
These solutions may be obtained by analytic continuation of the Dirac kets to the whole
complex plane. When so doing, a discrete set of resonant solutions (Gamow states)
arises embedded in the sea of the general ”background solutions” [1]. Asymptotically
the Gamow states feature only either outgoing or incoming plane waves with (complex)
momenta corresponding to poles of the S-matrix. We notice that in the complex-
momentum plane (which is isomorphic to a two-Riemann-sheet complex-energy plane),
the bound states correspond to momenta in the positive imaginary axis, their mirror
momenta in the negative imaginary axis corresponding to the anti-bound states. Both
bound and anti-bound momenta are also poles of the S-matrix. One should also notice
that the resonances, the background and the anti-bound solutions exhibit an exponential
spatial growth that places them far outside the Hilbert space L2 .

In the calculation of inner products between states of the continuum spectrum with

real momentum, integrals of the type

I(±k) ≡ Z +∞

0

dx e±i kx

(k ∈ R)

(1)

arise [2][3]. These integrals can be regularized by adding to k a small imaginary part ±iǫ,
which ensures the convergence of (1), and then letting ǫ → 0+. The result is meaningful
as a distribution [4] given by the well-known Sokhotski-Plemelj formula

I(±k) = ±i

k ± i 0+ = ±i P V

For freely propagating plane waves with momenta p and p′, the simpler integral

−∞

dx eikx = I(−k) + I(k)

(k = p − p′)

(2)

(3)

arises and yields the usual result I(−k) + I(k) = 2πδ(k).

Continuing I(k) in (1) to the complex plane, namely deﬁning I(z) (z ∈ C), requires
further regularization of the integral as long as it generally diverges for Im z < 0. We
adopt the widely used Gaussian regularization [5][6]

which is directly related to (7.1.2) in [7], where w = −iz/(2√λ). The limit λ → 0+
is taken afterwards. Notice that, when completing a square in the exponent of the
integrand in (4) and changing the integration variable to t = √λ x + w , one obtains
the intermediate expression

4 < arg(t) < π

The integral representation (7.1.2) is convergent when the path of the complex
integration variable t approaches ∞ along a direction − π
4 . This condition
is fulﬁlled by (5) for any ﬁnite w. However, in (4) the limit λ → 0+ (and hence w → ∞)
not always can be taken before the integration is carried out, because the function
fλ(x) ≡ e−λx2 does not converge uniformly to the function f0(x) = 1 when λ → 0+ .
For Im z > 0 the limit can be taken in the integrand in (4) because the ﬁniteness
of the integral is always assured by the convergence factor e−(Im z) x, trivially yielding
i z−1. In this case J(z, λ) converges to J(k, 0) = iz−1 when λ → 0+ .

For real z the result (2) is obtained.
For Im z < 0 the integration and the limit λ → 0+ do not commute, in which case
we adopt the limit of the integral as a prescription. In the right-hand side of (4), the
limit λ → 0+ can be directly inferred from (7.1.23) in [7], namely

limw→∞√π w ew2

erfc(w) = ( 1

4 < arg(w) < 3 π

Therefore (4) yields an extension of J(z, 0) to a new region of the lower half complex
plane, namely

J(z, 0) = ( i

4 < arg(z) < 5 π

(7)

The domain D+ where J(z, 0) is ﬁnite is thus the complex plane C minus a wedge in
the lower half plane that includes the point z = 0. We call J(z, 0) ≡ I(z) for short.

2. Distribution in the complex plane

Interpreting I(k) in (2) as a distribution means that

Z +∞

−∞

dk I(k) f (k) = i P V Z +∞

−∞

dk

k

f (k) + π f (0)

(8)

on a set of test functions f (k). Notice that the integration on the real axis k ∈ R is
involved in this deﬁnition.

Likewise, interpreting (7) as a distribution requires prescribing a set of test functions
and an integration path in the complex plane. Consider a (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) path Γ ⊂ D+
and the set of analytic functions fΓ(z) which are integrable along Γ. Then

IΓ

dz I(z) fΓ(z) = iIΓ

dz

fΓ(z)

z

< ∞ ,

(9)

and (9) deﬁnes a functional trivially involving I(z) = iz−1 in a strict function sense.

We now show that, for paths Γ ⊂ D+ albeit for crossing the singular point z = 0,
I(z) still has a meaning as a distribution in the enlarged sense above†. In fact, we can
divert Γ, so as to fully keep it within D+, by deforming it to a new path Γǫ + Cǫ, where
Γǫ is the path Γ stripped of a segment of length 2ǫ centered in z = 0, Cǫ is a half-circle of

as a distribution for integration paths Γ ⊂ D+ and crossing z = 0. Notice also that,
according to (7), for ǫ > 0 the apex of the divergence wedge of I(z) is at the point −iǫ .
Similarly, for paths Γ in the domain D− (≡ C minus a wedge in the upper half plane

containing z = 0) and crossing also z = 0 we have

I(−z) = −i

The complex generalization of (3) is equally clear-cut. For ǫ > 0 the apex of the
divergent wedge of I(−z) is at the point +iǫ, so that the regular domain of I(−z) + I(z)
contains the point z = 0, although in the limit ǫ → 0+ the wedges pinch this point and
the domain D = D− ∩ D+ again excludes z = 0 (Fig.2).
We then have

3. A derivation with real integrations

The results in the previous sections can be attained along the more traditional lines of
derivation of the Sokhotski-Plemelj formula involving real integrations [4]. This provides
a complementary insight that may be useful in some applications.

We re-derive the formula, as displayed in (2), albeit for the real line R tilted by a
ﬁxed angle φ in the complex plane, namely by writing k = q eiφ ∈ C, where q ∈ R and
−π/4 < φ < π/4 initially (Fig.3).
We again add an imaginary part iǫ to k, so that

I(k + iǫ) =

i

k + iǫ

(13)

and interpret it as a distribution when letting ǫ → 0+. Again we write the denominator
of (13) in polar form

k + iǫ = |k + iǫ| ei arg(k+iǫ)
where, for the complex k deﬁned above,

arg(k + iǫ) = arctan

q sin φ + ǫ

+ π Θ(−q)

Figure 3. The real integration path tilted in the complex plane.

The ﬁrst term in the right-hand side of (15) has a discontinuity at q = 0 that just
compensates for the one of the step function Θ(−q), so that (15) is a continuous function
of q , ranging from φ + π to φ for q going from −∞ to +∞ , and becoming discontinuous
for ǫ → 0+ , namely

(16)

(17)

(18)

arg(k + i 0+) = φ + π Θ(−q)

.

Taking the logarithm of (14) we have

ln(k + iǫ) = ln|k + iǫ| + i arg(k + iǫ)
and diﬀerentiating it with respect to k we obtain

(k + iǫ)

The derivatives in (18) can be worked out by taking into account that d
dq , but
they are cumbersome and of little interest. Taking the limit ǫ → 0+ and recalling (16)
we obtain the simple expression

dk = e−iφ d

(19)

Albeit for the constant factor e−iφ, (19) is the Sokhotski-Plemelj formula for the real
variable q, being therefore meaningful as a distribution on test functions f (q eiφ).

The derivation of (19) above is actually valid for −π/2 < φ < π/2 , namely for
straight integration paths crossing the origin and sweeping almost the whole complex
plane. However (13) holds only for k + iǫ ∈ D+ , that is, for −π/4 < φ < π/4 .

4. Conclusions

7

Extending the usual Dirac delta orthogonality between eigenstates of the continuum
real energy and momentum to the so called ”background solutions”, which are the
continuation of the former to the complex momentum plane, entails a corresponding
complex generalization of the Dirac Delta (DD) distribution. This can be done
by adopting a Gaussian regularization of the integral representation, arising when
computing inner products generally involving background and resonant solutions.
In
fact, the Gaussian convergence factor is able to cope with the space exponential growth
of these solutions.

We have seen that the distributions Cauchy Principal Value (CPV) of 1

x and the
DD, originally deﬁned for real variables, admit an extension to the complex plane,
namely P V 1
z and δ(z), on the space of test functions fΓ(z) which are analytic and
integrable on paths Γ crossing the point z = 0. Under these deﬁnitions, the Sokhotski-
Plemelj (SP) formula has a natural extension to the whole complex plane. However,
the Gaussian regularization of the usual integral representations yields the SP formula
only for integration paths Γ ⊂ D = D+ ∩ D− ⊂ C, where the domains D+ and D−
are the complex plane C minus wedge-shaped regions where the integrals diverge upon
removing the regularization. This is the main result of this paper. Regularizations more
powerful than the Gaussian one might exist that yield a regular domain even larger than
D, perhaps almost the whole C.

The above deﬁnition of the extension of generalized functions to the complex plane,
referred to line integrals of test functions, is alternative to the traditional one by Gel’fand
et al. (see the Vol.I, App. B of [4]), in which the generalized functions act on the test
functions through surface (or 2m-volume, for m variables) complex integrals with the
diﬀerential form dz d¯z = −2i dx dy. In that case the SP formula might not have any
immediate and useful meaning. Thinking the complex extension of distributions in
terms of line integrals rather than of surface integrals was already implicit in [8], and is
more suited for some problems of scattering theory.

In fact, an application of the above result is the following: The scattering solutions
(continuum spectrum of real positive energy E) for a potential barrier are mutually DD-
orthogonal and, if no bound states occur, also yield a complete basis of the Hilbert space.

In any case, the operator R dE |EihE| is idempotent (i.e. it is a projector) accordingly.
Consider now paths Υ ⊂ C with maximum slope within the interval (−π/4, +π/4), and
the set of background solutions with momenta z ∈ Υ, so that z − z′ ⊂ D for any z′ ∈ Υ
else. Then our result leads to an analogous DD-orthogonality hz|z′i = δ(z − z′) between
these background states‡, and hence HΥ dz |zihz| is a projector as well. This turns useful

in the search for expansions of wave functions and operators in terms of resonances and
background states [10] [11].

‡ The proper continuation of the bras, or ”left kets”, to the complex plane must be used [9].
