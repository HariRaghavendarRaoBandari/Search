SUPER-RICCI FLOWS FOR METRIC MEASURE SPACES. I.

KARL-THEODOR STURM

Abstract. We introduce the notions of ‘super-Ricci ﬂows’ and ‘Ricci ﬂows’ for time-dependent
families of metric measure spaces (X, dt, mt)t∈I . The former property is proven to be stable
under suitable space-time versions of mGH-convergence. Uniformly bounded families of super-
Ricci ﬂows are compact. In the spirit of the synthetic lower Ricci bounds of Lott-Sturm-Villani
for static metric measure spaces, the deﬁning property for super-Ricci ﬂows is the ‘dynamic
convexity’ of the Boltzmann entropy Ent(.|mt) regarded as a functions on the time-dependent
geodesic space (P(X), Wt)t∈I . For Ricci ﬂows, in addition a nearly dynamic concavity of the
Boltzmann entropy is requested.

Alternatively, super-Ricci ﬂows will be studied in the framework of the Γ-calculus of Bakry-

´Emery-Ledoux and equivalence to gradient estimates will be derived.

For both notions of super-Ricci ﬂows, also enforced versions involving an ‘upper dimension

bound’ N will be presented.

Introduction

A. Given a manifold M and a smooth 1-parameter family (gt)t∈I of Riemannian tensors on
M , we say that the ‘time-dependent Riemannian manifold’ (M, gt)t∈I evolves as a Ricci ﬂow if
Ricgt = − 1

Ricgt ≥ − 1

∂tgt

holds true (regarded as inequalities between quadratic forms on the tangent bundle of (M, gt)).
Due to the groundbreaking work of Perelman [Pe1, Pe2, Pe3], see also [CZ, KL1, MoT], Ricci ﬂow
is known to be a powerful tool and inspiring source for many questions and new developments.
The objective of this paper are new characterizations in terms of optimal transport for both,
Ricci ﬂows and super-Ricci ﬂows. More precisely, super-Ricci ﬂows will be characterized by the
dynamic convexity of the Boltzmann entropy S : (t, µ) (cid:55)→ Ent(µ|volt) regarded as a function on
the time-dependent geodesic space (P(M ), Wt)t∈I . This is an innovative concept of convexity
in space-time settings. For instance, a smooth function V on I × M is dynamically convex iﬀ

for all t ∈ I and all gt-geodesic (γτ )τ∈[0,1] in M . Here dt denotes the Riemannian distance
induced by gt and ∂tdt its variation in time. ∂τ Vt(γτ ) is the slope of Vt along γ. Note that we
strictly separate space and time derivatives: time derivatives are considered for ﬁxed pairs of
points in space and spatial diﬀerentiation is performed along geodesics in ﬁxed time-slices.
Recall that in the time-independent case, a function V on (M, g) is K-convex iﬀ HessgV ≥ K·g

or equivalently iﬀ ∂τ V (γτ )(cid:12)(cid:12)τ =1 − ∂τ V (γτ )(cid:12)(cid:12)τ =0 ≥ K · d2(γ0, γ1) for all geodesics (γτ )τ∈[0,1] in M .

As for the classical concept of K-convexity, the new concept of dynamic convexity easily extends
to the setting of time-dependent geodesic spaces.

The innovative notion of dynamic convexity will allow us to study and analyze super Ricci
ﬂows in great generality. Even more, in combination with a related concept of nearly dynamic
concavity it allows to give a precise meaning of Ricci ﬂows in a quite general framework.

B. On of the main contributions of this paper is to present synthetic notions of super-Ricci
ﬂows and Ricci ﬂows for time-dependent metric measure spaces (X, dt, mt)t∈I . Here and in the
sequel, X is a Polish space equipped with

• a 1-parameter family of geodesic metrics dt which generate the topology of X
• and a 1-parameter family of Borel measures mt, absolutely continuous w.r.t. each other,

say mt = e−ftm for some probability measure m and suitable ‘weight’ functions ft.

To simplify the presentation here, let us assume that all the measures mt are ﬁnite, that all the
metrics dt are bounded and that t (cid:55)→ dt(x, y) is absolutely continuous uniformly in x and y.

The basic quantity for the subsequent considerations will be the time-dependent Boltzmann

entropy

S : (t, µ) (cid:55)→ Ent(µ|mt)

regarded as a function on the time-dependent geodesic space (P(X), Wt)t∈I where for each t
under consideration Wt denotes the L2-Wasserstein distance on P(X), the space of probability
measures on X, induced by the metric dt.

Deﬁnition 0.1. We say that the time-dependent mm-space(cid:0)X, dt, mt

t∈I is a super-Ricci ﬂow
if the Boltzmann entropy S is strongly dynamical convex in the following sense: for a.e. t ∈ I
and every Wt-geodesic (µτ )τ∈[0,1] with ﬁnite entropy at the endpoints, the function τ (cid:55)→ St(µτ )
is absolutely continuous on [0, 1] and

Among the many examples to which this concept applies, there are two prominent classes

which are well studied:

• time-dependent weighted Riemannian manifolds
• static metric measure spaces.

A time-dependent weighted Riemannian manifold is a family(cid:0)M, gt, ˜ft
mm-space (cid:0)X, dt, mt

t∈I where M is a manifold
equipped with a 1-parameter family (gt)t∈I of smooth Riemannian metric tensors and a family
of measurable functions ˜f : M → R (the ‘weights’). It induces canonically a time-dependent
t∈I with X = M , dt being the Riemannian distance associated with gt,

C. Let us recall that more than a decade ago, the author [St2, St3] – and independently
Lott & Villani [LV1] – introduced a synthetic deﬁnition of generalized lower bounds for the
Ricci curvature of mm-spaces. These deﬁnitions of lower Ricci bounds initiated a wave of
investigations on analysis and geometry of mm-spaces and led to many new insights and results.
Until now, however, no similar concept for upper bounds on the Ricci curvature was available.
Surprisingly enough, such a deﬁnition can be given easily and very much in the same spirit as
for the lower bounds. It will be brieﬂy introduced in Appendix 1 (Chapter 4) of this paper. The
extension to the dynamic setting will lead to a synthetic notion of sub-Ricci ﬂows and thus also
of Ricci ﬂows.

t∈I is called weak sub-Ricci ﬂow if for
i Xi such that for all i, for any pair of nonempty
open sets U 0, U 1 ⊂ Xi and for a.e. t there exists a Wt-geodesic (µτ )τ∈[0,1] with τ (cid:55)→ St(µτ ) being
(ﬁnite and) absolutely continuous on (0, 1), supp(µτ ) ⊂ U τ for τ = 0, 1 and

D. The concept of super-Ricci ﬂows will allow for a huge class of examples. Occasionally, it
might be desirable to focus on a more restrictive class controlled by an additional parameter
N ∈ [1,∞] (playing the role of some upper bound on the dimension).

Deﬁnition 0.6. A time-dependent mm-space (cid:0)X, dt, mt

t∈I is called super-N -Ricci ﬂow if for
a.e. t ∈ I and every Wt-geodesic (µτ )τ∈[0,1] with ﬁnite entropy at the endpoints, the function

E. Under weak assumptions (being fulﬁlled in most cases of application) the deﬁning property
of super-Ricci ﬂows allows for important simpliﬁcations and equivalent re-formulations:
• if the spaces (X, dt, mt) are known to satisfy RCD(−κt,∞)-conditions then it suﬃces to
check the dynamic convexity condition for ‘suﬃciently many’ geodesics. More precisely,
it suﬃces to check that for each pair of measures µ0, µ1 with ﬁnite entropy there exists
a connecting geodesic for which (2) is satisﬁed.
• if the distances t (cid:55)→ dt satisfy a certain lower exponential growth bound (with ‘control
function’ λ ∈ L1
loc(I)) then (2) can be replaced by a integrated version: integration w.r.t.
τ allows to replace the spatial derivatives ∂±

τ St(µτ ) by diﬀerences:

• integration w.r.t. t ﬁnally allows to replace the time derivative ∂−

This results in a weak formulation of super-Ricci ﬂows which is stable under convergence.
The relevant convergence concept here is a space-time version of the D-convergence introduced
by the author in [St2] and being closely related to measured Gromov-Hausdorﬀ convergence.

As in the static case, such a stability result together with some additional growth bounds will

F.
In a forthcoming paper, accompanying this here, we will study the heat equation on time-
dependent mm-spaces. Given (X, dt, mt)t∈I , under suitable regularity assumptions we will prove
existence, uniqueness and regularity for solutions to the heat equation. Among others, this will
lead to equivalent characterization of super-Ricci ﬂows in terms of

(cid:46) dynamic convexity of the Boltzmann entropy
(cid:46) monotonicity of Wasserstein distances for the dual/backward heat ﬂow acting on prob-

ability measures

(cid:46) gradient estimates for the forward heat ﬂow acting on functions
(cid:46) a Bochner inequality involving the time-derivative of the metric.

The latter two properties can also be formulated – and proven to be equivalent – in the framework
of the Γ-calculus of Bakry-´Emery-Ledoux. This setting is partly more general (it also applies
to non-reversible operators), partly more restrictive (it requires a dense ‘smooth’ algebra of
functions).
In Appendix 2 (Chapter 5) of the current paper, we extend the well-known Γ-
calculus to time-dependent families of diﬀusion operators (Lt)t∈I deﬁned on a common algebra
A.

SUPER-RICCI FLOWS FOR METRIC MEASURE SPACES. I.

For each t, the usual deﬁnitions yield square ﬁeld operators Γt and its iterate Γ2,t. The family

(Lt)t∈I is called super-Ricci ﬂow if

∂tΓt.

(10)

This will lead to an alternative – a priori seemingly unrelated – approach to super-Ricci ﬂows.
In a forthcoming second part to this paper, it will be linked with the concepts and results
from previous chapters. The main result right now provides an important and elementary
characterization for super-Ricci ﬂows in terms of gradient estimates for the heat ﬂow.

Theorem 0.10. Under appropriate regularity assumptions, a propagator (P s
equation Ltu = ∂tu on I × X will exist. It will satisfy the gradient estimate

t u) ≤ P s
if and only if (Lt)t∈I is a super-Ricci ﬂow.

G. From the very ﬁrst days when Lott & Villani and the author presented their approach
to synthetic bounds on the Ricci curvature for mm-spaces, the ubiquitous question was how
this concepts relates to Ricci ﬂow. Besides some isolated results [McT, Lo1, To1, To2, GiM],
however, during all these years no deeper relation – and in particular no extension to mm-spaces
– could be established.

The study of Ricci ﬂows with irregular or incomplete Riemannian manifolds as initial data
is a broad and hot ﬁeld of current research, see e.g. [GiT, KoL, La, MRS, PSSW, Si1, Si2,
Yi]. The recent papers by Kleiner/Lott [KL2] and by Haslhofer/Naber [HaN] provide the ﬁrst
weak characterizations of Ricci ﬂows – the results, however, still being formulated for smooth
Riemannian manifolds; the former, moreover, essentially being restricted to the 3-dimensional
case.

Preliminary remarks. Throughout this paper, we use ∂t as a short hand notation for d
dt .

Moreover, we put

and combinations of them. We use the abbreviations usc, lsc, and ac for upper semicontinuous,
lower semicontinuous and absolutely continuous, resp.

We denote by χτ,σ = min{σ(1 − τ ), τ (1 − σ)} the Green function on [0, 1] and put

In the sequel, lower indices always indicate ‘time’ parameters

1. Dynamic Convexity

1.1. Convexity. This chapter is devoted to introducing a new concept of convexity (‘dynamic
convexity’). Before doing so, let us recapitulate some basic facts on convex functions.

A function u : (σ, τ ) → R is called convex iﬀ

u(b) ≤ c − b
c − a

· u(a) +

b − a
c − a

· u(c)

(12)

for all σ < a < b < c < τ . Every such convex function u is absolutely continuous on (σ, τ ) and
diﬀerentiable in a.e. point b ∈ (σ, τ ) (more precisely, in all but at most countably many points).
In particular,

(cid:90) c

a

u(c) − u(a) =

u(cid:48)(b) db

6

KARL-THEODOR STURM

for all σ < a < b < c < τ . In each point b ∈ (σ, τ ) both the right and left derivative exist. Each
of them is a non-decreasing function of b.
Let us add the remarkable observation of Sierpinski that u : (σ, τ ) → R is convex if and only
(‘midpoint

if it is Lebesgue measurable and if (12) holds for all σ < a < c < τ and b = a+c
2
convexity’).
Lemma 1.1. For any function u : (σ, τ ) → R, the following are equivalent

(i) u is convex
(ii) u is absolutely continuous with u(cid:48) being non-decreasing on its domain of deﬁnition (or,
(iii) u is absolutely continuous with u(cid:48)(cid:48) ≥ 0 in the sense of distributions

b u(b) or with non-decreasing b (cid:55)→ ∂−

equivalently, with non-decreasing b (cid:55)→ ∂+

b u(b)).

Proof. “(i) ⇒ (ii)” was already stated. Let us prove the implication “(ii) ⇒ (i)”. Absolute
continuity of u and – for the last inequality – monotonicity of the derivative imply

(c − b)u(a) + (b − a)u(c) − (c − a)u(b)

= −(c − b)

u(cid:48)(t)dt + (b − a)

(cid:2)−u(cid:48) (a + (b − a)t) + u(cid:48) (b + (c − b)t)(cid:3) dt

b

To apply the monotonicity assumption we used the fact that a + (b − a)t ≤ b + (c − b)t.
For “(ii) ⇒ (iii)” it suﬃces to observe that the distributional derivative of a non-decreasing
function is nonnegative. For the converse, note that a nonnegative distribution (like u(cid:48)(cid:48)) is a
measure and thus - by integration - gives rise to a nondecreasing function (which in this case is
u(cid:48)).
(cid:3)
A function deﬁned on a closed interval, say u : [σ, τ ] → R, is convex iﬀ (12) holds for all
σ ≤ a < b < c ≤ τ . Equivalently, u is convex if and only if it is upper semicontinuous (‘usc’)
on [σ, τ ] and absolutely continuous (‘ac’) on (σ, τ ) with u(cid:48) being non-decreasing on its domain
of deﬁnition.
K ∈ R.
Lemma 1.2. For any K ∈ R and any function u : (σ, τ ) → R, the following are equivalent

A straightforward extension of the concept of convexity is K-convexity with some number

(i) For all σ < a < b < c < τ

u(b) ≤ c − b
c − a

· u(a) +

b − a
c − a

· u(c) − K
2

(c − b)(b − a)

(13)

(ii) u is ac and for all a < c for which u(cid:48) exists

u(cid:48)(a) ≤ u(cid:48)(c) + K(c − a)

(iii) u is ac with u(cid:48)(cid:48) ≥ K in the sense of distributions.
A function with any these properties is called K-convex.

The proof is just a slight variation of the previous one and is left to the reader.

Remark 1.3. In [EKS] the authors introduced the concept of (K, N )-convexity which also will
play an important role throughout this presentation. It is a reinforcement of K-convexity in-
volving an additional parameter N ∈ R+. A function u : (σ, τ ) → R will be called (K, N )-convex
iﬀ it is absolutely continuous and if

in the sense of distributions.

Let us now consider the concept of convex functions in the setting of geodesic spaces. There
exist several similar but slightly diﬀerent deﬁnitions. The common basic idea behind these
deﬁnitions is that convexity is requested ‘along geodesics’. That is V : X → R will be called
convex iﬀ u = V ◦γ : [0, 1] → R is convex. The diﬀerence in the deﬁnitions essentially boils down
to the question whether this is requested for all geodesics or for ‘suﬃciently many’ geodesics.
Another diﬀerence in the deﬁnitions arises from requesting the convexity inequality (12) either
for all triples a, b, c of points within an interval, say [0, 1], or only for the triples 0, b, 1.

A geodesic space in the sequel always will mean a complete metric space (X, d) such for each
pair of points x, y ∈ X there exists a curve γ : [σ, τ ] → X of length d(x, y) which connects them
(i.e. with γσ = x and γτ = y). Geodesics are curves of constant speed which (globally) minimize
length.
Given a function V : X → (−∞,∞], its domain of ﬁniteness will be denoted by Dom(V ) =
{x ∈ X : V (x) < ∞}.
Deﬁnition 1.4. Given a geodesic space (X, d) and a number K ∈ R, a function V : X →
(−∞,∞] is called

• weakly K-convex if for every pair of points x0, x1 ∈ Dom(V ) there exists a geodesic

(γτ )τ∈[0,1] connecting x0 and x1 such that for all τ ∈ [0, 1]

V (γτ ) ≤ (1 − τ )V (x0) + τ V (x1) − Kτ (1 − τ )d2(x0, x1)/2;

(14)
• properly K-convex if for every pair of points x0, x1 ∈ Dom(V ) there exists a geodesic

(γτ )τ∈[0,1] connecting x0 and x1 such that for all ρ, τ, σ ∈ [0, 1] with ρ < τ < σ

V (γτ ) ≤ σ − τ
σ − ρ

V (γσ) − K(τ − ρ)(σ − τ )d2(x0, x1)/2;
• strongly K-convex if for every geodesic (γτ )τ∈[0,1] and for every τ ∈ [0, 1]

Vt(γρ) +

τ − ρ
σ − ρ

V (γτ ) ≤ (1 − τ )V (γ0) + τ V (γ1) − Kτ (1 − τ )d2(x0, x1)/2.

(15)

(16)

In the case K = 0, the function V is simply called weakly convex or properly convex or strongly
convex, resp.

Remark. One might study these concepts also in a more general setting where d is just a sym-
metric function on X × X with values in [0,∞] which satisﬁes the triangle inequality and which
vanishes on the diagonal. Replacing X by the quotient space X(cid:48) := X/d if necessary, one can
achieve that d only vanishes on the diagonal.
If d is no longer assumed to be ﬁnite then in
the above deﬁnitions the existence of connecting geodesics should be requested only for pairs of
points with ﬁnite distance.

Obviously, strong K-convexity implies proper K-convexity which in turn implies weak con-
vexity. Surprisingly, under weak regularity assumptions also the converse implications hold
true.
Theorem 1.5. Assume that (X, d) is a locally compact geodesic space and V : X → (−∞,∞]
a lower semicontinuous function which in addition is upper semicontinuous along all geodesics
with endpoints in Dom(V ). Then the following are equivalent

(i) V is properly K-convex
(ii) V is wekaly K-convex
(iii) V is weakly midpoint K-convex in the sense that for every pair of points x0, x1 ∈ Dom(V )

there exists a midpoint x1/2 of x0 and x1 such that

This result and the subsequent proof is due to the author. It has been presented in several
private communications to colleagues, e.g. in May 2012 during the ERC Summer School “Anal-
ysis and Geometry in Metric Measure Spaces” in Pisa. Since then, it has been used (and partly
reproduced) in various publications.

Remark. The local compactness of X can be replaced by the weaker requirement that for each
r, x and λ the set {V ≤ λ} ∩ Br(x) is compact.
Proof. It remains to prove the implication “(iii) ⇒ (i)”. Fix x0, x1 ∈ Dom(V ) and consider the
set of midpoints

Z = {z ∈ X : d(x, z) = d(y, z) =

d(x, y)}.

1
2

Among this bounded, closed set of midpoints we select one which minimizes V . More precisely,
local compactness of X implies compactness of Z. Together with lower semicontinuity of V
it guarantees the existence of a minimizer of V in Z. Call this midpoint x1/2.
In the next
step deﬁne analogously a midpoint of x0 and x1/2 with minimal value of V , call it x1/4, and a
midpoint of x1/2 and x1 with minimal value of V , call it x3/4 .

The crucial point of this approach is that this construction implies that the inequality (17)
now also holds true for the triple x1/4, x1/2, x3/4 in the place of the triple x0, x1/2, x1. Indeed,
weak midpoint K-convexity applied to the pair x1/4, x3/4 provides a midpoint of them, say ˜x1/2,
such that x1/4, ˜x1/2, x3/4 satisﬁes inequality (17). But the previously selected point x1/2 is also
a midpoint of x1/4, x3/4. Indeed, it is a minimizer of V among all these midpoints. Thus (17) is
satisﬁed for the triple x1/4, x1/2, x3/4.
The midpoint construction – and the previous argumentation – will now be iterated to deﬁne
a family of points xτ , τ = k2−n for k = 0, 1, . . . , 2n and n ∈ N. All these points will lie on a
geodesic connecting x0 and x1. Taking the metric completion of this ‘dyadic curve’ yields the
requested geodesic (xτ )τ∈[0,1]. Iteration of the midpoint inequality (17) will yield the convexity
inequality (15) for dyadic ρ, τ, σ ∈ [0, 1]. Continuity of V along the geodesic (xτ )τ∈[0,1] ﬁnally
allows to extend this property to all real triples ρ, τ, σ ∈ [0, 1].
(cid:3)

An alternative version which completely avoids any compactness assumption reads as follows.
Proposition 1.6. Assume that V : X → R is continuous along geodesics and weakly midpoint
K-convex. Then it is properly K(cid:48)-convex for each K(cid:48) < K.
Proof. We essentially follow the previous argumentation. However, due to lack of compactness
we cannot insist that x1/2 is a minimizer of V among the midpoints. Instead, we will choose
a midpoint which minimizes V up to /2. In all the subsequent iterative steps we allow small
errors: the point x(2i+1)/2n will be chosen among the midpoints of x(2i)/2n and x(2i+2)/2n to
minimize V up to 4−n. It ﬁnally will yield the convexity inequality (15) with an extra term .
Choosing  suﬃciently small (depending on (K − K(cid:48)) d2(x0, x1)) will prove the claim.
(cid:3)
Proposition 1.7. For every V : X → (−∞,∞] the following are equivalent

(i) V is strongly K-convex
(ii) for every geodesic (γτ )τ∈[0,1] with γ0, γ1 ∈ Dom(V ) the function τ (cid:55)→ V (γτ ) is usc on

(i) V is weakly K-convex
(ii) there exists λ ∈ R such that for every x0, x1 ∈ Dom(V ) there exists a geodesic (γτ )τ∈[0,1]

Proof. To see “(i) ⇒ (ii)” simply add up the convexity inequalities with parameters τ and 1− τ
to obtain

For “(ii) ⇒ (iii)”, ﬁx x0, x1 and n ∈ N. For i = 0, . . . , n − 1, construct iteratively pairs

In many cases of applications which we have in mind, the functions under considerations are

known to share regularity properties of semiconvex functions.

For “(iii) ⇒ (iv)” let an arbitrary geodesic γ be given (with ﬁnite values of V at the endpoints).
For suitable sequences σn (cid:38) 0 and τn (cid:37) 1 choose geodesics ˜γn :→ X connecting γσn to γτn for

1.2. Time-dependent Geodesic Spaces. For the subsequent discussion, our basic setting
will be a space X equipped with a 1-parameter family of geodesic metrics (dt)t∈I where I ⊂ R
is a ﬁxed interval which is assumed to be open from the left. (More generally, one might allow
dt to be pseudo metrics where the existence of connecting geodesics is only requested for pairs
x, y ∈ X with dt(x, y) < ∞.)

Given a function γ : [σ, ρ] → X, τ (cid:55)→ γτ , its action (w.r.t. dt) is given by

One can also introduce the more general concept of dynamically K-convex functions (or,

Proposition 1.14. Assume that κ is an upper log-Lipschitz control for the time-dependent
metric space (X, dt)t∈I and that V is strongly dynamically convex on I × X. Then for a.e. t ∈ I

requested since on the LHS the slope of V along (some suitable interpolating geodesic) ˜γ appears
- however, it should be the slope along the originally given γ. To overcome this, we make the
summation only over i = 2, . . . , k − 1 (instead of i = 1, . . . , k) in order to obtain

By assumption Vt is upper regular along each dt-geodesic, thus in particular along the geodesic
given by γ on [0, τ1] ∪ [τk−1, 1] and by ˜γ on [τ1, τk−1]. Hence, the LHS of the above inequality
(28) is bounded from above by

−∂τ Vt(γτ1−) + ∂τ Vt(γτk−1+).

Again by upper regularity of Vt this approaches −∂τ Vt(γ0+)+∂τ Vt(γ1−) as τ1 → 0 and τk−1 → 1.

introduced and utilized e.g. in [AGS1, AGS2, AGS3] turned out to be extremely powerful. We
present here an analogous concept for the dynamic case. However, this seems to be less powerful
for applications. We will not use it in subsequent chapters.
Given a function V : I × X → (−∞,∞], a curve (xt)t∈(r,T ) with (r, T ) ⊂ I will be called
upward (EV I)dyn-gradient ﬂow for V if s (cid:55)→ dt(xs, y) is absolutely continuous, uniformly in t
and y, and if for a.e. t ∈ (r, T ), all z ∈ X with Vt(z) < ∞, and each dt-geodesic (γa)a∈[0,1]

terminating in (T, x(cid:48)) can be regarded as a downward gradient ﬂow emanating in (T, x(cid:48)) and
running backward in time.

1.6. The Smooth Riemannian Setting. Convexity allows for an alternative, more explicit
characterization in the Riemannian setting. It is well-known that a smooth function V : M → R
is convex if and only if Hess V ≥ 0 and, more generally, it is K-convex if and only if Hess V ≥ K·g.

The time-dependent extension of these results reads as follows.

Proposition 1.23. Given a manifold M with a smooth 1-parameter family of Riemannian
metric tensors (gt)t∈I , then a smooth function V : I × M → R is dynamically convex if and only

Lemma 1.24. Let M be a compact manifold M equipped with a smooth 1-parameter family of
Riemannian metric tensors gt, t ∈ I, with I being a left open interval and let V : I × M → R be
a smooth function. Then for each (T, x(cid:48)) ∈ I × M there exists r ∈ I, r < t and a smooth curve
x : [r, T ] → M terminating in x(cid:48) (i.e. xT = z) which solves the gradient ﬂow equation

where Cpl(µ, ν) as usual denotes the set of all probability measures on X × X with marginals µ
and ν. In general, Wt might take the value +∞, i.e. it will only be a pseudo metric. However,
this will cause no troubles since all discussions will be restricted to the subspace

Pt =

µ ∈ P : Wt(µ, δz) < ∞ for some/all z ∈ X

(cid:110)

Remark. More generally, one might assume that dt is not really a metric but just a pseudo
metric on X, possibly attaining values 0 and ∞ oﬀ the diagonal. Then also Wt will be a pseudo
metric on P which canonically induces to a metric on the quotient space Pt/Wt.

Proof. RCD(−κt,∞) implies that St is −κt-convex along every Wt-geodesic in Pt. Since semi-

RCD(−κt,∞).
Proof. (i) From (47) with τ = 1
2 we deduce that St is Kt-midpoint convex (in the sense of The-
orem 1.5 (iii)) with Kt = −(2κt + λt). Selecting iteratively midpoints yields the Kt-convexity
inequality (16) for each dyadic τ ∈ [0, 1]. Lower semicontinuity of St allows to deduce this
inequality for all τ ∈ [0, 1]. In other words, for the static space (X, dt, mt) we have deduced the
curvature dimension condition CD(Kt,∞). Together with the assumption of being inﬁnitesi-
mally Hilbertian this yields the RCD(Kt,∞)-condition. (The curvature bound will be improved
in part (ii) below.) Thus in both cases, Lemma 2.3 applies and states that S is upper regular.
(ii) The claim follows from Proposition 1.14. For convenience, let us repeat directly the
argument: Thanks to upper regularity, the previous Corollary applies and proves (46). Combined
with the log-Lipschitz bound it yields

As already illustrated in the previous result, there are close links between the deﬁning property
of super-Ricci ﬂows and synthetic Ricci bounds in the sense of Lott-Sturm-Villani. Other results
of this type will follow from Propositions 1.12 and 1.13. We re-formulate the easier of them.
Proposition 2.7. Given an inﬁnitesimally Hilbertian mm-space (X, d, m), a number K ∈ R
and a non-empty interval I ⊂ {t ∈ R : 2Kt < 1}. Then the following are equivalent

(i) (X, d, m) satisﬁes the curvature-dimension condition RCD(K,∞);

t∈I is a super-Ricci ﬂow where d2

t = d2 · (1− 2Kt) and mt = m for all t under

consideration.

Example 2.8. Let X = [−1, 1] × S1 equipped with a metric g of constant curvature −1 and
glued together along the boundaries (i.e. identifying (−1, α) and (+1, α)). Put gt = (1 + 2t)g.
Let dt and mt be the associated Riemannian distance and Riemannian volume, resp. Then

(cid:0)X, dt, mt

(cid:1)

t∈(−1/2,∞) is a super-Ricci ﬂow.

SUPER-RICCI FLOWS FOR METRIC MEASURE SPACES. I.

23

It should be added that this certainly will not be a ‘minimal super-Ricci ﬂow’ (whatever
deﬁnition for the latter one might choose). For example, at any time t0 > −1/2 one can start to
smoothen out the positive curvature concentrated up to time t0 on the rim and then to evolve
according to the classical Ricci ﬂow equation for smooth manifolds which for t → ∞ eventually
will approach a ﬂat torus.

For smooth Riemannian manifolds, super-Ricci ﬂows are nothing but super-solutions to the
Ricci ﬂow equation. (One should take into account, however, that these are not scalar quantities.
Super-solutions have to be understood in the sense of inequalities between quadratic forms.)

A time-dependent weighted Riemannian manifold is a family (cid:0)M, gt, ˜ft
dependent mm-space(cid:0)X, dt, mt

t∈I where M is a
manifold equipped with a 1-parameter family (gt)t∈I of smooth Riemannian metric tensors and
a family of measurable functions ˜f : M → R (the ‘weights’).

Proof. For the ‘if’-implication we have to verify that the Boltzmann entropy St(.) = Ent(.|mt)
is dynamically convex on (P, Wt)t∈I . Fix t ∈ I (and drop it from the notation as far as pos-
sible). Given a Wt-geodesic (µτ )τ∈[0,1] let F τ : X → X for each τ be the unique optimal
map with the push forward property (F τ )(cid:93)µ0 = µτ . From seminal work of Otto, Otto/Villani,
McCann, Cordero-Erausquin/McCann/Schmuckenschl¨ager, vonRenesse/Sturm and others [Ot,
OV, CMS, vRS, St1] we know quite well that one can estimate the second derivative of the
entropy (along geodesics in the Wasserstein space) in terms of the Ricci curvature of the under-
lying space together with the Hessian of the weight function. Combined with the assumption
(48) it immediately yields the estimate for the distributional second derivative the lower bound

In the spirit of Theorem 2.9 one may formulate and prove (following the lines of argumentation
in the proof of that result as well as in [St1] and in [EKS]) an extension and tightening depending
on the extra parameter N .

Theorem 2.14. Let (cid:0)M, gt, ˜ft
induced time-dependent mm-space (cid:0)X, dt, mt

t∈I be a time-dependent Riemannian manifold of dimension n
with a smooth family (gt)t∈I of metric tensors and a smooth family ( ˜ft)t∈I of weights. Then the

in the sense of inequalities between quadratic forms on the tangent bundle of (M, gt).
In particular for N = n this requires ˜ft to be constant. That is, the measure mt has to be – up
to renormalization – the Riemannian volume measure volt, more precisely, ∃Ct s.t. mt = Ct·volt
for each t.

Remark 2.15. Similar characterizations will be possible for super-Ricci ﬂows of Finsler spaces.
Here the relevant quantity will be the ﬂag Ricci curvature, see [OS] for the static case.

2.5. Ricci Flows. The previous characterization of super-Ricci ﬂows is a natural extension of
the synthetic lower bounds on the Ricci curvature to the time-dependent setting. The concept
of synthetic lower bounds for the Ricci curvature, formulated in terms of optimal transports,
has led to plenty of results and new insights. Despite the fact that during the last decade only
lower bounds for the Ricci curvature have been studied, there is also a surprisingly elementary,
synthetic characterization of upper bounds for the Ricci curvature in terms of optimal transports.
It will be introduced and discussed in Appendix 1. The time-dependent version will provide us
with a natural deﬁnition of Ricci ﬂows.

Example 2.19.

(i) Let X be the doubling of the unit disc B1(0) ⊂ Rn (= gluing of two copies along their

boundaries) in n ≥ 2. Then the static space (X, d, m) is not a weak Ricci ﬂow.

If µ0 is supported in one of the copies of B1(0) and µ1 in the other, then optimal
transports on X have to pass the rim and will descry the focusing eﬀect of the positive
curvature concentrated on the rim.

(ii) Let X be a cone over a circle of length α < 2π. Then the static space (X, d, m) is a weak

Ricci ﬂow.

In this case, the positive curvature (concentrated in the vertex) will not be detected

since optimal transports never pass through the vertex [BS].

In the forthcoming second part to this paper, we will present a more restrictive notion

of ‘Ricci ﬂows’ which will rule out this example.

Same argument as for (ii) – now, however, we indeed expect that this space is a ‘Ricci

ﬂow’ in a more restrictive sense.

(iv) The time-dependent mm-space from Example 2.8 is not a weak Ricci ﬂow. The positive
curvature concentrated in the glued boundaries will be detected by optimal transports.
(Same argument as for (i).)

2.6. Averaged Super-Ricci Flows. We started our discussion of super-Ricci ﬂows for mm-
spaces with the most comprehensive deﬁnition which involves derivatives w.r.t. space and time.
In a ﬁrst step, we already got rid of the spatial derivatives by passing to λ-moderate super-Ricci
ﬂows. In the next step now we will illustrate how to get rid of the time-derivatives.
For simplicity, here and in the sequel we assume that d is uniformly bounded on I × X
and lower absolutely continuos in t, uniformly in x, y, in the following sense: there exists a
nonnegative function η ∈ L1

loc(I) such that for all s < t

Boundedness of d implies that Pt = P for all t and the lower absolute continuity immediately
carries over to the Wasserstein distances:

s (x, y) ≤ W 2
W 2

(55)
We will henceforth also assume that all the measures mt for t ∈ I are absolutely continuous
w.r.t. each other with uniformly bounded densities and that they measurably depend on t. In
other words, there exist a bounded measurable function f : I × X → R and a Borel measure m
such that mt = e−ftm for all t. Note that then

3. Stability and Compactness of Super-Ricci Flows

One of the most important property of the synthetic Ricci bounds in the sense of Lott-Sturm-
Villani for ‘static’ mm-spaces is their stability under convergence – and as a consequence a far
reaching compactness result which extends Gromov’s famous per-compactness result. Conver-
gence in this context is most naturally formulated in terms of optimal transports. It essentially
coincides with measured Gromov-Hausdorﬀ convergence (but leads to slightly stronger results).
Let us now try to carry over these concepts and results to the time-dependent setting.

bounded interval I of length |I|. The mm-spaces (X, dt, mt)t∈I to be considered will always be
requested to have ﬁnite measures mt which are equivalent to each other with bounded densities.
Thus we always may represent them as

mt = e−ftm

with a family of bounded measurable functions (ft)t∈I and some ‘reference’ probability measure
m. Instead of (X, dt, mt)t∈I we then will write (X, dt, ft, m)t∈I . The choice of the probability
measure m, a priori, is not unique. For well-deﬁnedness, we assume that it is the normalized
2 (T0 + T1) for I = (T0, T1].

Cpl(dt, ˜dt) denotes the set of couplings of the metrics dt and ˜dt. These are pseudo-metrics on
the disjoint union of X and ˜X which on the respective subsets coincide with the given metrics,
see [St2] for the precise deﬁnition and a detailed discussion.

Time-dependent mm-spaces (X, dt, ft, m)t∈I and ( ˜X, ˜dt, ˜ft, ˜m)t∈I will be considered as equiv-

alent if their DI -distance is 0.

In most of the subsequent applications, however, both
the distances dt and the weights ft will be uniformly bounded. Then all these transportation
distances will be equivalent to each other and thus for simplicity we restrict to the case p =

Lemma 3.1. DI is a metric on the space of equivalence classes of time-dependent mm-spaces.

Proof. The triangle inequality follows with the standard argument based on the gluing lemma.

Given a bounded interval I, a continuous increasing function (‘modulus of continuity’) Φ :
R+ → R+ with Φ(0) = 0, and constants K, L ∈ (0,∞), let XI (K, L.Φ) denote the space of
equivalence classes of time-dependent mm-spaces (X, dt, ft, m)t∈I

• with compact separable X, probability measure m,
• with bounded measurable (t, x) (cid:55)→ ft(x), lower semicontinuous in x,

The bound (59) implies |dt(x, y) − ds(x, y)| ≤ Φ(|J|) for all t ∈ J and thus

|dJ (x, y) − ds(x, y)| ≤ Φ(|J|).

Hence, the distances dJ and ds – being regarded as distances on two disjoint copies of X – can
be coupled by deﬁning the distance of corresponding points by Φ(|J|)/2. In other words,

D(cid:16)(cid:0)X, ds, m(cid:1),(cid:0)X, dJ , m(cid:1)(cid:17) ≤ Φ(|J|)/2.

That is, ‘uniformly bounded’ DI -limits of λ-averaged super-N -Ricci ﬂows are λ-averaged

super-N -Ricci ﬂows.

Proof. (i) We follow the strategy from [St2] for the proof of stability for synthetic Ricci bounds in
the static case. Fix K, L ∈ (0,∞) and N ∈ [1,∞] as well as a sequence of time-dependent mm-
t , mn)t∈I which converges to a mm-space (X, dt, ft, m)t∈I . For each n choose
spaces (X n, dn
an optimal (or almost optimal) coupling qn(dx, dy) of m(dx) and mn(dy). Deﬁne Markov kernels
qn(x, dy) and qn(dx, y) via disintegration of qn(dx, dy) by

t , f n

qn(dx, dy) = qn(x, dy)m(dx) = qn(dx, y)mn(dy).

32

These kernels later will be used to transport probability densities from X n to X and vice versa.
Let probability measures µ0 and µ1 on X be given as well as an interval J ⊂ I and numbers
. Indeed, we may

(61)

(The limit case will follow by approximation.)
By means of the ‘transport kernel’ qn(dx, y) we now transport the measures µ0 and µ1 from
X to X n. That is, we deﬁne corresponding probability measures µn,b = ρn,b · mn for b ∈ {0, 1}
X ρb(x) qn(dx, y). Finally, these probability measures will be transported
· m on X for b ∈ {0, 1} with

where ρn,b(y) = (cid:82)
(x) =(cid:82)

(ii) According to the previous Lemma, for each t ∈ I as n → ∞ the mm-spaces (X n, dn
will converge to the mm-space (X, dt, m) w.r.t. the metric D. More precisely, we know that

t = ˜ρn,b

t (µn.0, µn,1) → Wt(µ0, µ1)
W n

as n → ∞. This property will be requested for the endpoints of the interval J, i.e. for t = r and
t = s in case J = (r, s].

(iii) Without restriction, we may assume that the given measures µ0 and µ1 have bounded
densities w.r.t. m, say ρ0 ≤ C(cid:48) and ρ1 ≤ C(cid:48). This bound is preserved by the transport kernel.
Thus ρn,b ≤ C(cid:48) for b ∈ {0, 1} and all n. Therefore, for b ∈ {0, 1}

Let us consider the entropy w.r.t. the reference measures S(cid:5)(µ) = Ent(µ|m) and Sn(cid:5) (µ) =

that

Thus, in particular, S(cid:5)(˜µn,b) → S(cid:5)(µb) as n → ∞ by lower semicontinuity of S(cid:5) and the fact
that ˜µn,b → µb for b ∈ {0, 1} (again by adaption of the argument in [St2], Lemma 4.19: it yields

as ‘reference space’, equipped with uniformly equicontinuous functions f : I × X → R and
d : I × X × X → R. Indeed, for both functions, continuity in t with modulus Φ was explicitly
requested. Uniform continuity in x is expressed as follows:

|ft(x) − ft(y)| ≤ Φ(dt(x, y) ≤ Φ(L · dT (x, y))

|dt(x, y) − dt(x(cid:48)y(cid:48))| ≤ dt(x, x(cid:48)) + dt(y, y(cid:48)) ≤ L · [dT (x, x(cid:48)) + dT (y, y(cid:48))].

Now consider on these approximating spaces the sequence of uniformly equicontinuous func-

convergence (along suitable n-isometries ιn : X → X n) towards a uniformly continuous func-

dn : I × X n × X n → R. For a suitable subsequence we obtain convergence towards a uniformly
continuous function d : I × X × X → R (‘Arzela-Ascoli’). Symmetry and triangle inequality
carry over from the approximating functions to the limit. The fact that dn

preserved by the limit and yields dT (., .) = d(., ., T ).
(Indeed, |f − fn ◦ ιn| ≤ 2 Φ() on X as soon as

It remains to prove that for each t ∈ I the limit space (X, dt, mt) satisﬁes the CD(−K,∞)-

in general, the assertion is not a direct consequence
of the stability result for lower Ricci bounds since optimal couplings for the DI -distance and
associated transport kernels are not w.r.t. the measure mt but w.r.t. mT .

Our argument closely follows ths proof of the previous Theorem 3.3. Given µ0, µ1 on X, we
deﬁne as before µn,0, µn,1 as their images on X n under the transport kernels (same as before).
These measures on X n will now be connected by a geodesic (µn,b

4. Appendix: Synthetic Upper Bounds for Ricci Curvature of MM-Spaces

In this chapter, we present a synthetic deﬁnition of generalized upper bounds for the Ricci
curvature of mm-spaces. Before doing so, let us recall that more than a decade ago, the au-
thor [St2, St3] – and independently Lott & Villani [LV1] – introduced a synthetic deﬁnition of
generalized lower bounds for the Ricci curvature of mm-spaces. These deﬁnitions of lower Ricci
bounds initiated a wave of investigations on analysis and geometry of mm-spaces and led to
many new insights and results. Until now, however, no similar concept for upper bounds on the
Ricci curvature was available. Surprisingly enough, such a deﬁnition can be given easily and
very much in the same spirit as for the lower bounds.

Proof. Assume that (73) holds true and that K(cid:48) = K + ε for some ε > 0. Let M =(cid:83)

open covering of M by convex domains Mi with suﬃciently small diameter (where ‘suﬃciently’
will depend on bounds on the sectional curvature on Mi and on ε).
Given open sets U 0, U 1 ⊂ Mi, choose a geodesic γ in Mi with endpoints γσ ∈ U σ for σ = 0, 1
and a smooth function ϕ : M → R with

Put F τ (x) = expx(−τ∇ϕ) and consider the geodesic in P induced by µτ = (F τ )(cid:93)µ0 with
bounded densities uτ w.r.t. m where µ0 is chosen to be concentrated in a small neighborhood of

small neighborhood of γτ . Moreover, following [St1, St2] put
Aτ (x) = dF τ (x), U τ = ∇τAτ ◦ (Aτ )−1,

yt = log detAτ .

It is well-known (e.g.
Ent(µτ|m) can be expressed in terms the above quantities due to the fact that

that U τ is ‘small’ along γ (in any given norm) provided the curve γ is ‘short’. (The precise

5. Appendix: Super-Ricci Flows for Diffusion Operators

Let us now present another, completely diﬀerent approach to super-Ricci ﬂows. It is formu-

lated in terms of the so-called Γ-calculus of Bakry, ´Emery and Ledoux [BE, Le, BGL].

5.1. Time-dependent Diﬀusion Operators. Throughout this chapter, we assume that we
are given a 1-parameter family (Lt)t∈[0,T ) of linear operators deﬁned on an algebra A of functions
on a set X such that Lt(A) ⊂ A for each t. (The fact that we choose the time interval to start at
0 is just for convenience; here and in the sequel, we could choose any other time interval [S, T ].)
We assume that we are given a topology on A such that limits and derivatives make sense. In

assume that Lt is a diﬀusion operator in the sense that

Γ2,t(u, v)(x) =

[LtΓt(u, v) − Γt(u, Ltv)(x) − Γt(u, Ltv)](x).

We put Γt(u) = Γt(u, u) and Γ2,t(u) = Γ2,t(u, u). In terms of the Γ2-operator we deﬁne the Ricci
tensor at the space-time point (t, x) ∈ [0, T ) × X by

5.2. Super-Ricci Flows.

Deﬁnition 5.1. We say that (Lt)t∈[0,T ) is a super-Ricci ﬂow if

∂tΓt ≤ 2Rt.

(80)

It is called Ricci ﬂow if ∂tΓt = 2Rt.
Lemma 5.2. (Lt)t∈[0,T ) is a super-Ricci ﬂow if and only if

(81)
Proof. Obviously (80) implies (81) since Γ2,t ≥ Rt. For the converse, ﬁx t, x, u,  > 0 and choose
suitable v = ψ(v1, . . . , vk) ∈ A0
x such that Rt(u)(x) ≥ Γ2,t(u + v)(x) − . The fact that v ∈ A0
implies by chain rule that Γs(u + v)(x) = Γs(u)(x) for all s. Thus in particular

x

∂tΓt ≤ 2Γ2,t.

This proves the claim.

∂tΓt(u + v)(x) = ∂tΓt(u)(x).

(cid:3)

Remark 5.3. (Lt)t∈[0,T ) is a Ricci ﬂow if and only if in addition to (81) for each x, each  > 0
and each u ∈ A there exists v ∈ A0

x such that

∂tΓt(u)(x) +  ≥ 2Γ2,t(u + v)(x).

(82)

Corollary 5.4. Let X = M be a manifold M with a smooth 1-parameter family of Riemannian
metrics (gt)t∈[0,T ] and let (Lt)t∈[0,T ] be the associated Laplace-Beltrami operators acting on the
algebra A of smooth functions which vanish at inﬁnity. Then for each x ∈ X the following are
equivalent:

(i) −∂tgt ≤ 2Rict
(ii) ∂tΓt ≤ 2Rt
(iii) ∂tΓt ≤ 2Γ2,t.

40

KARL-THEODOR STURM

Proof. It remains to prove the equivalence of (i) and (ii). For this, note that gt(∇tu,∇tu) =

t (Du, Du) = Γt(u, u) and thus

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=t

∂tgt(∇su,∇su)

= −∂tΓt(u, u).

Moreover, note that according to [St5], Rict(∇tu,∇tu) = Rt(u, u) for each u ∈ A.

and in the limit s → t thus ∂tqt ≤ 0. According to the previous calculation, however,

This proves (i)

Remark 5.6. The proof shows also the equivalence of

(i’) ∂tΓt(u) ≥ 2Γ2,t(u)
(ii’) Γt(Ps,tu) ≥ Ps,t(Γs(u))

(∀u ∈ A)

as well as the equivalence of the two statements with ”=” instead of ”≥”. Note, however, that
in the Riemannian case the assertions ∂tΓt(u) ≥ 2Γ2,t(u) and ∂tΓt(u) = 2Γ2,t(u) are no proper
diﬀerential equations on the tangent bundle since the RHS involves not only the vector ﬁelds ∇u
but also higher derivatives of u. In contrast to that, (i) of Theorem 5.5 allows a reformulation
(see Corollary 5.4) as an inequality on the tangent bundle.
5.3. Super-N -Ricci Flows. Given any extended number N ∈ [1,∞] we deﬁne the N -Ricci
tensor at (t, x) by

∂tΓt ≤ 2RN,t.
If equality holds then (Lt)t∈[0,T ) is called N -Ricci ﬂow.

Remark 5.9. If we start with the operators Lt, then soon or later the question will come up
to choose measures mt such that for given t the operator Lt is symmetric (or, more precisely,
essentially self-adjoint) on L2(X, mt). In non degenerate ﬁnite-dimensional cases, such a measure
mt will be uniquely determined (up to multiplicative constants) by the operator Lt, provided
there exists one.

It should be pointed out, however, that the approach via Γ-calculus also applies to non-

reversible operators – and in this respect is more general than the approach via mm-spaces.

5.4. Starting with the Gradients. Instead of starting with a 1-parameter family of operators,
alternatively we may start with a 1-parameter family of square ﬁeld operators. To do so, assume
that X is a Polish space with a 1-parameter family (mt)t∈[0,T ] of measures on it. Let A be an
algebra of measurable functions on X such that A is dense in L2(X, mt). The basic ingredient
will be a 1-parameter family (Γt)t∈[0,T ] of

• symmetric, positive semideﬁnite bilinear forms Γt on A
• each of which has the diﬀusion property

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

Γt(Ψ(u1, . . . , uk), v) =

Ψi(u1, . . . , uk)Γt(ui, v).

The operators Lt then are deﬁned through the property

Γt(u, v) dmt = −

Ltu v dmt

(∀u, v ∈ A).

We say that the family (Γt, mt)t∈(0,T ) is a super-Ricci ﬂow if property (81) is satisﬁed where Γ2,t
is deﬁned in terms of Lt.
Remark 5.10. In cases of applications, the measures typically are given as mt = e−ftm(cid:5)
ft ∈ A and some (‘reference’) measures m(cid:5)
to the measure m(cid:5)
ft. Deﬁne L(cid:5)

t for some
t on X. Often we will ﬁrst consider Γt with respect
t and then in a second step consider the eﬀect of the time-dependent weights

t as an operator on A by
L(cid:5)
t u v dm(cid:5)

t = −
and deﬁne similarly Lt by replacing all m(cid:5)

(cid:90)
t by mt. Then Lt = L(cid:5)

t − Γt(., ft) and thus

(∀u, v ∈ A)

Γ2,t = Γ(cid:5)

2,t + Htft,

Rt = R(cid:5)

t + Htft.

In particular, the family (Lt)t∈(0,T ) deﬁned by the family (Γt, ft)t∈(0,T ) is a super-Ricci ﬂow if
and only if

∂tΓt ≤ Γ(cid:5)

2,t + Htft

which imposes no restriction on the evolution of the weights ft. Each family of weight functions
(ft)t∈(0,T ) provides a diﬀerential inequality for square ﬁeld operators.

Example 5.11. (i) Let ψ : R+ → R+ be any smooth positive function and z : R+ → Rn an
arbitrary curve in Rn. Put

ft(x) = ˙ψt · (cid:107)x − zt(cid:107)2/2,

Γt(u) = ψt · (cid:107)∇u(cid:107)2

t (for all t) be the Lebesgue measure in Rn. Then (Lt)t∈(0,T ) is a super-Ricci ﬂow.

and let m(cid:5)
Indeed,

∂tΓt = Γ(cid:5)

2,t + Htft.

(ii) Let us consider a time-dependent weighted, n-dimensional Riemannian space (X, gt) with
measures mt = e−ftvolt and operators Lt = ∆t −∇tft∇t. Being a super-N -Ricci ﬂow for N = n
implies that ft is constant in x (without restriction ≡ 1).
5.5. Outlook. In a forthcoming second part to this paper, we will deﬁne and analyze the heat
propagator associated with the canonical family of Laplacians (Lt)t∈[0,T,) on time-dependent
metric measure spaces (X, dt, mt)t∈[0,T,). It will turn out that in great generality the latter is
a super-N -Ricci ﬂow in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.11 if and only if (Lt)t∈[0,T,) is a super-N -Ricci
ﬂow in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.7.

Moreover, these properties will be proven to be equivalent to the gradient estimate (iii) in
Theorem 5.7 for the forward heat ﬂow P s
t (acting on functions) as well as to certain transport
In the case N = ∞, the
inequalities for the dual ﬂow ˆP s
latter will coincide with the monotonicity property w.r.t. time-dependent Wasserstein distances
for the dual heat ﬂow

t (acting on probability measures).
