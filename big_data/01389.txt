We study, in theory and experiment, the quantum properties of correlated light ﬁelds measured
with click-counting detectors providing incomplete information on the photon statistics. We es-
tablish a correlation parameter for the conditional statistics, and we derive the corresponding non-
classicality criteria for detecting conditional quantum correlations. Classical bounds for Pearson’s
correlation parameter are formulated that allow us, once they are violated, to determine nonclassical
correlations via the joint statistics. On the one hand, we demonstrate nonclassical correlations in
terms of the joint click statistics of light produced by a parametric down conversion source. On
the other hand, we verify quantum correlations of a heralded, split single-photon state via the con-
ditional click statistics together with a generalization to higher-order moments. We discuss the
performance of the presented nonclassicality criteria to successfully discern joint and conditional
quantum correlations. Remarkably, our results are obtained without making any assumptions on
the response function, quantum eﬃciency, and dark-count rate of the considered photodiodes.

INTRODUCTION

Photon statistics of light lies at the heart of quantum
optics. Starting with the landmark experiments of Han-
bury Brown and Twiss [1], the photon distribution can
be used to determine whether or not the ﬁeld is consis-
tent with a classical description. The classical theory of
radiation is properly retrieved in a quantum system when
a state of light can be written as classical mixtures of co-
herent states. Whenever such a description fails, this is
referred to as nonclassical light [2]. However, uncovering
nonclassical phenomena in the presence of loss, decoher-
ence, and using imperfect devices is typically very chal-
lenging [3–5]. Moreover, quantum behavior deﬁnes the
foundation of modern quantum technologies [6], which
results in a pressing need for reliable tools to process
quantum states that are robust against real world envi-
ronments. As the physical implementations become ever
more complex, it is helpful if analysis techniques place
minimal assumptions on the underlying principle of op-
eration of such devices.

Characterizing the correlations of two beams of light,
A and B, can be done in two ways. Firstly, one can
access the nonclassical character of light via joint cor-
relation functions, similarly to the proposal of Hanbury
Brown and Twiss [1]. Secondly, one can ask: “How well
is the outcome of a measurement in system B determined
for a ﬁxed outcome in A?” and “Is the degree of determi-
nation compatible with classical light?” While the ﬁrst
approach is based on the joint probability distribution,

∗ jan.sperling@uni-rostock.de

the latter questions address the conditional statistics. In
quantum systems, the conditional type of correlations
leads to quantum eﬀects such as steering [7, 8]. How-
ever, conditional correlations are typically not studied in
the context of nonclassical radiation ﬁelds.

In general, quantum features of the photon number
statistics can be accessed with nonclassicality tests [9–
15]. However, detectors that directly measure the pho-
ton distribution are not commercially available as they
require, for instance, cryogenic cooling; see [16] for an
overview. To gain signiﬁcant albeit incomplete infor-
mation about a given state of light,
it is possible to
consider systems consisting of multiple on-oﬀ detectors,
that is, avalanche photodiodes (APDs) in the Geiger
mode [17, 18]. Examples of such schemes are given by
CCD detectors systems [19–23] and multiplexing lay-
outs [24–27]. In the latter scenario, one splits light into
several spatial beams or temporal bins with smaller in-
tensities, each being measured with an APD. The main
feature of the resulting click-counting statistics is its bi-
nomial character [28], which signiﬁcantly diﬀers from the
Poissonian form of the photon-number distribution; see
also Refs. [29, 30]. Therefore, the nonclassicality probes
have to be adjusted properly to correctly uncover non-
classical light [31, 32]. Such a technique directly iden-
tiﬁes quantumness in integrated waveguides [33] or sys-
tems with high losses [34]. These state-of-the-art imple-
mentations underline the functionality of click-counting
detectors for applications in realistic scenarios. However,
such techniques are speciﬁc to joint correlations of quan-
tum states, and they may fail to uncover the conditional
nonclassicality.

In this contribution, we present a generalized approach

to handling statistics from multimode states which place
minimal assumptions on the detectors. For this rea-
son, we formulate a conditional correlation parameter
and derive its bounds for classical light. We addition-
ally compute the classical limits for Pearson’s correla-
tion coeﬃcient for inferring nonclassicality of the joint
click distribution. By implementing a parametric-down-
conversion source, we produce diﬀerently quantum corre-
lated states of light that are probed with our approaches.
Our method for the nonclassical conditional statistics is
generalized and applied to access higher-order moments.

II. CLICK-COUNTING DETECTORS

Let us brieﬂy recall the theory of click-counting de-
vices. The probability that a = 0, . . . , NA out of NA
APDs produce a coincidence click event is [28]

(cid:28)

(cid:18)NA

(cid:19)

(cid:29)
A(ˆ1 − ˆπA)NA−a:
ˆπa

,

(1)

c(a) =

:

a

with ˆπA = ˆ1 − exp(−Γ(ˆnA/NA)). In this normally or-
dered expectation value, (cid:104):··· :(cid:105), ˆnA is the photon number
operator and Γ is the so-called detector response func-
tion. One typically considers a linear response Γ(x) =
ηx + ν (quantum eﬃciency η; dark count rate ν). Here,
we do not assume any form of Γ. Moreover, the click-
statistics gives an incomplete information about the pho-
ton statistics, because an inversion of a ﬁnite number of
clicks to an inﬁnite number of possible photon states is
in principle impossible. Similarly to the single mode case
in Eq. (1), one can describe the joint click-counting dis-
tribution c(a, b) for two light ﬁelds A and B [35]. In this
case the joint statistics is given by the operators ˆπA and
ˆπB as well as the numbers of APDs NA and NB.

The features of the click-counting statistics and the

quantum statistics are closely related, for example,

NAVarc(a)(a)−Ec(a)(a)(cid:0)NA−Ec(a)(a)(cid:1)

(cid:104):(∆ˆπA)2:(cid:105)=

,

A(NA−1)
N 2

(2)
with ∆ˆπA = ˆπA−(cid:104):ˆπA:(cid:105) and the symbol Ec(a) and Varc(a)
stand for the expectation value and the variance of the
b=0 c(a, b), respectively [31,
35]. It has been similarly shown for the covariance that

marginal statistics c(a) =(cid:80)NB

Covc(a,b)(a, b) = NANB(cid:104):∆ˆπA∆ˆπB:(cid:105).

(3)

For measuring quantum eﬀects of a single mode, one

can deﬁne the binomial Q parameter [31],

Ec(a)(a)(cid:0)NA − Ec(a)(a)(cid:1) − 1

NAVarc(a)(a)

Qc(a) =

cl.≥ 0.

(4)

For classical light, this parameter is non-negative. If this
condition is violated, one has sub-binomial light [32, 33].
However, the value of the binomial Q parameter cannot
give information about the correlations between a and b.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND

GENERATED STATES

2

We illustrate the measurement layout in Fig. 1.

(1−λ2)1/2(cid:80)∞

In
our experiment we adopt time-multiplexed click-counting
detectors, which separate the incoming light into NA =
NB = 8 distinct bins, by the use of two cascaded, unbal-
anced ﬁber Mach-Zehnder interferometers [25, 32]. To
generate our two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states,
n=0 λn|n(cid:105)A|n(cid:105)B (0<λ<1), we pump a non-
linear KDP crystal via type-II collinear parametric down
conversion [36]. This produces photon pairs in orthogo-
nal polarization modes. These modes are split at a po-
larizing beam splitter and directed to two spatially sep-
arated time-multiplexed detectors. We obtain a set of
joint counts C(a, b), which we normalize to obtain the
joint click probabilities c(a, b). At a pump pulse repeti-
tion rate of 250 kHz, we obtain single-click count rates of
the order ∼ 1 kHz, and taking data for approximately 10
minutes yields ∼ 107 data points. The split-photon (SP)
states, t|1(cid:105)A|0(cid:105)B + (1−t2)1/2|0(cid:105)A|1(cid:105)B (0<t<1), are pro-
duced by heralding a single photon from the parametric
down-conversion process, and splitting it into two modes.
The analysis is carried out in the same fashion as for the
TMSV state, but the overall number of samples is de-
creased to ∼ 106 data points, due to heralding. For the
error analysis, we refer to the Appendix A.

FIG. 1. (Color online) Schematic of the generation of a two-
mode squeezed-vacuum state (excluding the dashed framed
pattern) with a parametric down-conversion (PDC) source
and a single photon split at a polarizing beam splitter (PBS).
The latter one is generated by heralding onto the click of
the single APD and rotated in polarization with a half-wave
plate (HWP). Each resulting mode is sent to an 8-bin time-
multiplexed detector serving as our click counter (CC).

We generated two TMSV states and three SP states
with increasing summed click numbers, Ec(a,b)(a+b),
which correspond to diﬀerent photon numbers as a higher
number of clicks on the APDs imply more absorbed pho-
tons. We have click numbers in the interval 0.03 ≤
Ec(a,b)(a+b) ≤ 0.11 for the states TMSV1 and TMSV2,
as well as for the three states SP1,2,3 [cf. Table I]. As a
classical reference, we also characterized a two-mode co-
herent state, |α(cid:105)A|β(cid:105)B, by blocking the signal and send-
ing laser light into the free port of the last PBS in Fig. 1.

IV. CONDITIONAL QUANTUM

CORRELATIONS

3

The conditional statistics, p(b|a) = p(a, b)/p(a), de-
termines how well the outcome of b is determined for a
given a value. The variance of the conditional statistics,
Varp(b|a)(b), describes the uncertainty of b for a ﬁxed a.
In addition, if the outcome of a condition a is more likely
than another one, this should also have a larger contri-
bution to this uncertainty. Hence, we formulate a corre-
lation measure in term of the mean conditional variance
Ep(a)

(cid:0)Varp(b|a)(b)(cid:1) in the form:

κp(b|a) =1 − Ep(a)

.

(5)

(cid:0)Varp(b|a)(b)(cid:1)

Varp(b)(b)

In the Appendix A, we characterize the conditional cor-
relation coeﬃcient in Eq. (5). There, we show that
0 ≤ κp(b|a) ≤ 1 and that the lower and the upper bound
is attained for any uncorrelated and any perfectly corre-
lated probability distribution, respectively.

For the conditional click statistics, let us formulate
the bounds of κc(b|a) for classical light. For a classi-
cal state, the conditional statistics c(b|a) is also classical
(cf. Appendix A). The conditional binomial parameter
Qc(b|a) implies in this case Varc(b|a)(b) ≥ Ec(b|a)(b)(NB −
Ec(b|a)(b))/NB, cf. Eq. (4). Thus, we ﬁnd the following
constraint for classical states:

FIG. 2. (Color online) Results of conditional correlation coef-
ﬁcient κc(b|a) (blue, solid lines) and the corresponding classical
bounds κcl.max
c(b|a) (black, dashed lines) are shown including the
corresponding error bars. Note that the plotted line-width of
κc(b|a) is larger than its error bar in some cases. The light gray
areas show the classically allowed ranges, cf.
inequality (6).
The (red) area κc(b|a)<0 corresponds to the unphysical values.

V. CLASSICAL BOUNDS FOR JOINT

CORRELATIONS

For an arbitrary joint probability distribution p(a, b), a
well-established measure of joint correlations is Pearson’s
correlation coeﬃcient [38],

Whenever inequality (6) is violated the degree of de-
termination of b in terms of κc(b|a) is too large to be
compatible with classical light. Hence, we have con-
structed a measure for quantum correlations for condi-
tional click-counting statistics. The given bound κcl.max
c(b|a)
is tight, as for any binomial click-statistics, for instance
for coherent states, holds Varc(b|a)(b) = Ec(b|a)(b)(NB −
Ec(b|a)(b))/NB.
For comparison, we derived similar
bounds for photon-counting theory (cf. Appendix A).

We directly applied the conditional correlation param-
eter to our measured data, see Fig. 2. The uncorrelated,
classical coherent state is compatible with the expecta-
tion κc(b|a) ≈ κcl.max
c(b|a) ≈ 0. The quantum correlations
of the TMSV state are not accessible with the condi-
tional correlation parameter, κc(b|a) ≤ κcl.max
c(b|a) . For the
SP states, we encounter the fact that κcl.max
c(b|a) < 0. Since
κc(b|a) is necessarily non-negative, we have in such a case
c(b|a) < 0 ≤ κc(b|a), which violates the classical con-
κcl.max
straint (6). Thus, the SP states exhibit a nonclassical
conditional correlation.

(6)

For statistically independent random variables a and b,
we have γp(a,b)(a, b) = 0. A (negative)positive value char-
acterizes (anti-)correlations. The ultimate bound for any
statistics is |γp(a,b)(a, b)| ≤ 1.

Let us derive the bound for classical states. The co-
variance of the joint click-counting distribution can be
bounded for classical states via a normally-ordered form
of the Cauchy-Schwarz-inequality,

|(cid:104):∆ˆπA∆ˆπB:(cid:105)| cl.≤(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104):(∆ˆπA)2:(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)1/2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104):(∆ˆπB)2:(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)1/2

.

(9)

The normally ordered variances can be given in terms of
Eq. (2) for systems A and B. Using the deﬁnitions of
γc(a,b) in Eq. (8), Qc(a), and Qc(b), we conclude

−γcl.max.

Interestingly, the bound for a classical Pearson’s correla-

c(a,b) can be written solely in terms of
the measured binomial Q parameters for A and B, as well
as the numbers of APDs, NA and NB. In Appendix A, we
give a similar relation for the photon-counting detectors
in terms of the Mandel Q parameter [10]. There, we also
construct a non-linearly, perfectly correlated state whose

In Fig. 3, we show the application of the classical con-
straint (10) to our measurements. The value of the coher-
ent state is consistent with the expected value γc(a,b)=0.
The TMSV and the SP states are signiﬁcantly correlated
γc(a,b)>0 and anti-correlated γc(a,b)<0, respectively. In
addition, the TMSV states clearly exceed the classical

Thus, the TMSV states show joint nonclassical correla-
tions.

In Refs. [34, 35], we introduced and applied a method

Our results show that the correlation parameters
κc(b|a) and γc(a,b) are sensitive to diﬀerent kinds of quan-
tum correlations and complement each other. On the
one hand, the conditional correlation coeﬃcient detects
quantum correlations of the SP states in terms of the
conditioned click statistics c(b|a). On the other hand,
Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient is sensitive to correla-
tions of the joint click statistics c(a, b) which applies to
the TMSV states.

The higher-order conditional nonclassicality-number
Nc(b|a) in Eq. (12) is given in Table I together with a
benchmark of the implemented methods. The classical
coherent state and the TMSV state do not exhibit signif-
icant negativities and, thus, do not violate condition (12).
By contrast, all SP states are clearly distinct from the
classical upper bound, even state SP1 (which has the
lowest summed click number, see Table I).

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We described and implemented rigorous and directly
applicable approaches to uncover quantum correlated
light ﬁelds. We established a correlation coeﬃcient for
conditional statistics to access conditional quantum cor-
relations measured with informationally incomplete click-
counting detectors. For accessing quantum correlations
of the joint statistics, we derived the bounds for Pear-
son’s correlation coeﬃcient for classical light. Applying
both techniques, we successfully characterized nonclas-
sical photon correlations for the experimentally gener-
ated light ﬁelds. The corresponding criteria are solely
based on the measured click statistics without any need

for knowing or correcting for the quantum eﬃciency, the
dark count rate, and the exact response function of our
detection system. A generalization to higher order mo-
ments of conditional statistics was also included. Con-
ditional quantum correlations have been uncovered for
split-photon states by using second- and higher-order mo-
ments criteria. The joint quantum correlations of two-
mode squeezed-vacuum states have been identiﬁed via
Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient. Hence, our methods
provide simple and yet powerful approaches to verify dif-
ferent types of quantum correlated light ﬁelds for appli-
cations under realistic conditions.

1. Click counting and P function

We study the joint click-counting distribution, c(a, b),
its marginals c(a), and the conditional click-statistics
c(b|a) = c(a, b)/c(a). Thus, let us relate those notions to
the P function, which is the fundamental phase-space dis-
tribution for describing nonclassical eﬀects. The single-
mode click statistics c(a) in the Glauber-Sudarshan P
representation reads [28]

conditional distribution, ˜P (t|a) ≥ 0. Note that, if c(a) =
0, we use the typical convention c(b|a) = 0.

2. Conditional correlation parameter

Let us brieﬂy characterize the conditional correlation
coeﬃcient in Eq. (5), assuming that Varp(b)(b) (cid:54)= 0. For
doing so, we remind ourselves of the law of total vari-
ance [37],

(cid:0)Varp(b|a)(b)(cid:1) + Varp(a)

Varp(a,b)(b) = Ep(a)

(A7)
Firstly, it shows that κp(b|a) ≥ 0, as it can be written
as the ratio of the two variances Varp(a)
Varp(a,b)(b). Secondly, Eq. (A7) implies Varp(a,b)(b) ≥
Ep(a)
Let us show that the bounds 0 ≤ κp(b|a) ≤ 1 are
tight. Any uncorrelated statistics gives p(b|a) = p(b).

(cid:0)Varp(b|a)(b)(cid:1). This results in κp(b|a) ≤ 1.

(cid:0)Ep(b|a)(b)(cid:1).
(cid:0)Ep(b|a)(b)(cid:1) and

(cid:0)Ep(b|a)(b)(cid:1) (law of total expecta-

6

with Ep(a,b)(b) = Ep(a)
tion).

Now, let us construct an example to show that the
conditional correlation coeﬃcient can detect correlations
that cannot be inferred from Pearson’s correlation co-
eﬃcient. The example of a perfectly correlated photon
statistics is

p(a, b) = p(a)δb,f (a).

(A15)

A simple non-linear function is f (a) = a2, and we con-
sider a geometric probability distribution p(a) = (1−q)qa
with 0 < q < 1. In this case all required moments can be
computed analytically, which yields

(cid:112)(1+q)(1+9q)

1+3q

γp(a,b) =

and γcl.max

p(a,b) =

κp(b|a) = 1 and κcl.max

p(b|a) =

.

(A16)

,

This leads to Varp(b|a)(b) = Varp(a,b)(b) and, thus, we get
κp(b|a) = 0. A perfectly correlated statistics is described
by b = f (a) for a function f . Then, the conditional
statistics takes the form p(b|a) = δb,f (a), which yields
Varp(b|a)(b) = 0 and κp(b|a) = 1.

3. Treatment of photon statistics

The single-mode photon statistics for a = 0, 1, . . . pho-

tons is given by

p(a) =

:

ΓA(ˆnA)a

a!

e−ΓA(ˆnA):

,

(A8)

(cid:28)

(cid:29)

where ΓA is the detector response function. The mo-
ments of the statistics p(a) and the normally ordered
quantum statistics fulﬁll the known relations:

Ep(a)(a) =(cid:104):ΓA(ˆnA):(cid:105),

Varp(a)(a) − Ep(a)(a) =(cid:104): (∆ΓA(ˆnA))2 :(cid:105) cl.≥ 0.

(A9)

(A10)

Subsequently, Mandel Q parameter is non-negative for
classical radiation ﬁelds [10],

Moreover, the two-mode photon statistics p(a, b) yields a
covariance

Covp(a,b)(a, b) = (cid:104): (∆ΓA(ˆnA)) (∆ΓB(ˆnB)) :(cid:105),

(A12)

with ΓB being the detector response function for the mea-
surement in B.

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz-inequality together with re-
lation (A10), Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient can be
bounded for classical light as follows:

⇔ Covp(a,b)(a, b)2

(cid:104): (∆ΓA(ˆnA)) (∆ΓB(ˆnB)) :(cid:105)2

cl.≤(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104): (∆ΓA(ˆnA))2 :(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104): (∆ΓB(ˆnB))2 :(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)

⇔ |γp(a,b)| cl.≤

p(a,b) .

(A13)

In addition, we get for the conditional statistics, using
relation (A10) and the correlation parameter (5), that

κp(b|a) = 1 and κcl.max

i.e., we have classical joint correlation with respect to
|γp(a,b)| ≤ γcl.max
p(a,b) as well as a conditional nonclassicality,
as κp(b|a) > κcl.max
p(b|a) .

4. Data analysis and error propagation

Say the number of measured joint click-event (a, b) is
C(a, b), the number of events for a ﬁxed a is C(a) =
b C(a, b), and the total number of events is C =
a C(a). The relative frequencies of clicks give the
click statistics, c(a, b) = C(a, b)/C. Errors have been
estimated via the standard error of the mean, ∆y =
, and systematic errors have
been added (see discussion below). Errors for other quan-
tities have been quadratically propagated, ∆y(x1, . . .) =

(cid:80)
(cid:80)
(cid:0)Varc(a,b)(y(a, b))/(C−1)(cid:1)1/2

Let us consider the error propagation for κc(b|a) and
κcl.max
c(b|a) . For this reason, we deﬁne the quantity

c(a)c(b|a)c(b(cid:48)|a)

bb(cid:48).

with Kc(b|a) being the only quantity that cannot be di-

shows that Kc(b|a) = E˜c(b,b(cid:48))(bb(cid:48)). Therefore,
it can
be sampled via the convoluted (autocorrelation) statis-
tics ˜c(b, b(cid:48)).
Subsequently, the sampling error reads

large.

5. Raw data and results

Our measured raw data C(a, b) in a logarithmic scale
are plotted in Fig. 4 (page 7) and the results of the analy-
sis are summarized in Table II (page 9). Let us list some
additional information.

• A source of a systematic error can be seen in the
click events for SP2 [Fig. 4]. The event (a, b) =
(1, 7) clearly shows a problem with the coincidence
assignment in this measurement run. We corrected
for that and included a relative systematic error
εsys. = C(1, 7)/C = 2.3·10−6 for compensation.
• We explicitly give the probability c(0, 0) =
C(0, 0)/C [Table II] to show that we have signif-
icant no-click contributions, c(0, 0) > 90% for all
states. This also conﬁrms that we operate the
two-mode squeezer (i.e., the PDC source) in a low
squeezing regime. We can infer quantum correla-
tions, although we have high no-click probabilities.

• For characterizing the symmetry between system A
and B, we consider a symmetry number in form of

a Bures metric,

Sc(a,b) =

(cid:88)

a,b

(c(a, b)c(b, a))1/2 ,

(A21)

which gives the maximal value Sc(a,b) = 1 if and
only if c(a, b) = c(b, a). All states exhibit a high
symmetry, Sc(a,b) > 99.9%.

When interpreting this result, it is important to
recall that the (symmetric) no-click contribution is
already quite high. Additionally, the observed sym-
metry between systems A and B indicates that the
detectors monitoring the two output modes behave
similarly.

• For rows consisting of two sub-rows [see Table II],
we give for the quantity x the mean ¯x in the ﬁrst
row and its relative error ∆x/|¯x| in the second row.
• The relative error, i.e., the ratio ∆x/|¯x|, of quan-
tities which are close to zero, ¯x ≈ 0, is naturally
quite high. For example, we have for the coher-
ent state Covc(a,b)(a, b) = 3·10−6(1 ± 250%) or
κc(b|a) = 5·10−8(1 ± 1.5·103). The expected value

8

for both quantities is 0 for the uncorrelated coher-
ent state.

• The TMSV and SP states are sorted according
to the mean click numbers Ec(a)(a)=Ec(a,b)(a) and
Ec(b)(b)=Ec(a,b)(b). That is, for example, Ec(a)(a)
for state SP1 is smaller than Ec(a)(a) for state SP3.
• The single-mode binomial Q parameters, Qc(a) or
Qc(b), are given. We observe the expected results
that for coherent light holds Qc(a) ≈ Qc(b) ≈ 0
within the error margin [31]; the TMSV yields a
positive value as its marginal is a classical thermal
state [34]; and the SP states show negative values.
• We did not only studied properties of conditional
click statistics of the form c(b|a), but also for
c(a|b). The results for both cases are quite sim-
ilar and, thus, underline the previously discussed
symmetry. Only in the higher-order conditional
nonclassicality-numbers, Nc(b|a) and Nc(a|b), we can
see slight diﬀerences which show the higher sensi-
tivity of the higher-order conditional correlations.
