Abstract. Electric magnetic duality symmetry is well understood in vacuum. For
light propagating through a medium this symmetry is typically broken. We investigate
under what conditions duality transformation is preserved in a linear medium and
employ these conditions to generalise the deﬁnition of optical helicity to a general
linear medium. We will discuss some unique properties duality symmetric media
possess, provided they exist and reformulate Maxwell’s equation in such a way that
they explicitly show the decoupling of opposite helicities. The feasibility of constructing
a duality symmetric medium is discussed.

1. Introduction

In vacuum, nature treats electric and magnetic ﬁelds on equal footing [1], as a
consequence of a symmetry in Maxwell’s equations called electric magnetic duality
symmetry. For light, interchanging electric and magnetic ﬁelds is equivalent to changing
one linear polarisation for its orthogonal counterpart. As a consequence, both linear
polarisations of light propagate in exactly the same manner as long as electric-magnetic
duality symmetry holds. As soon as any piece of material is put in the path of a
light beam, this is typically no longer the case. For light impinging on a piece of
glass, for instance, the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients are diﬀerent for diﬀerent
polarisations. Here we investigate what the conditions are for which duality symmetry
remains preserved for the passage of light from one medium to another in linear optics.
That is, we consider when light can be refracted, reﬂected and absorbed in a manner
independent of its linear polarisation. In order to ﬁnd the required material properties,
we use a continuum description of Maxwell’s equations and only consider monochromatic
light in order to eliminate dispersion.

The conserved quantity associated with electric magnetic duality symmetry in
vacuum is the optical helicity, which can be interpreted as the amount of linking of the
electric and magnetic ﬁeld lines around each other [2, 3] or the spin component along the
wave vector [4, 5] or as the diﬀerence between the number of left handed and right handed

circularly polarised photons [4, 5, 6]. The topological deﬁnition (linking of ﬁeld lines
around each other) is problematic for monochromatic light, since for monochromatic
light the ﬁeld lines do not form closed loops, but go oﬀ to inﬁnity, however the other
two deﬁntions are unproblematic in vacuum. During the writing of this article, another
publication came to our attention which generalises the conservation law of optical
helicity to vacuum electrodynamics in the presence of electrical currents, and which can
be read a complementary to our work [7].

The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we will derive the conditions for
duality symmetry in a medium. We then use these conditions to extend the deﬁnition of
optical helicity to a general linear medium. These are our main results. We will consider
some simple examples of duality symmetric media to illustrate the consequences of
helicity conservation in section 3. In section 4 we will give a representation of Maxwell’s
equations that explicitly shows the decoupling of opposite helicity waves in a duality
symmetric medium. In section 5 the feasability of manufactiuring duality symmetric
materials and the broader implications of this work are discussed.

We will refrain from setting the vacuum permittivity, 0 and the vacuum
permeability µ0 equal to one, in order to easily generalise electrodynamics in vacuum
to electrodynamics in a medium.

2. Maxwell’s equations and duality transformations

As long as there are no charges, electric and magnetic ﬁelds are interchangable. This
means that under the duality transformation

Maxwell’s equations retain their form, with θ being an arbitrary angle [1]. As soon as
any piece of matter is introduced, this duality symmetry breaks at the microscopic level
because ordinary matter does contain electrically charged particles, but no magnetically
charged particles.

As long as no charges can get separated over distances on the order of half a
wavelength or more, a medium can be viewed as electrically neutral and the breakdown
of microscopic duality symmetry is of little importance. This requirement is met in
many practical cases (even most lasers do not ionise the air they travel through). If
we furthermore assume that the polarisation and magnetisation of the medium induced
by the light are linear in the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strength of the light, a simple
modiﬁcation of Maxwell’s equations can describe the eﬀect of the medium on the light
ﬁelds. In this case, duality symmetry remains preserved at the macroscopic level if the
modiﬁed Maxwell equations remain invariant under a generalised duality transformation.
The preservation of duality symmetry has been investigated for time independent,

duality rotations in media

isotropic, achiral media by Fernandez-Corbaton et. al. and the following result can be
seen as a generalisation of their work [8].

In classical electrodynamics, four diﬀerent ﬁelds are used E, H, D and B. E and
H are the ‘free’ electric and magnetic ﬁelds and D and B include the polarisation and
magnetisation of the medium as well. For a linear medium, D and B can be obtained
from E and H by a linear transformation

with ˆR being the (6 × 6) response matrix [9]

−iGjk(x; ω) + γjk(x, t; ω)

iGjk(x; ω) + γjk(x; ω)

(cid:35)

The entries  and µ are the permeability and permitivitty of the medium. These may
depend on position and may take the form of matrices if the medium is anisotropic. G
is the chiral response present in optically active media and γ is the magneto electric
respone, proposed by Tellegen [10] when he hypothesised a new electronic circuit
component and later veriﬁed to exist [11, 12, 13]. Like  and µ, G and γ may be
anisotropic and may depend on position and time. The only restriction imposed on ˆR
is that it is invertible. In vacuum, the response matrix is

ˆR0 =

0I
0

0
µ0I

,

(4)
with I a 3 × 3 unit matrix. Typically  (and sometimes G) are the only entries which
deviate signiﬁcantly from their vacuum values, but here we assume no restrictions on
any of the entries for generality.

The continuum Maxwell equations are usually written using all four ﬁelds, but
using the response matrix, two can be eliminated. Keeping only D and B, Maxwell’s
equations become in matrix form

The constant α for the duality transformation is given by

(8)

α2I = −1µ

(9)
The commutator identity used to derive duality symmetry does not only work for ˆR
being a matrix, it works for any linear invertible operator. This makes it possible to
generalise the above result to media with a nonlocal linear response.
In a nonlocal
medium, the polarisation and magnetisation at point r do not only depend on the
ﬁelds in r, but, due to interactions between neighbouring atoms, on the ﬁelds in the
surroundings of r as well. A linear nonlocal medium can be described by replacing the
elements of ˆR with integral kernels [14]‡.

Dα(x; ω) =

ei ω|x−x(cid:48)|

c Rαβ(x, x(cid:48); ω)Fβ(x(cid:48); ω)dV (cid:48).

(10)
Here Dα is one of the components of the six component (D, B) vector and Fα is one of
the components of the six component (E, H) vector and the indices α and β run from
1 to 6. These integral transforms are linear, so as long as they are invertible as well,
the same conditions for duality symmetry still apply. The caveat here is to ﬁnd out
if all integral kernels are invertible. If Rαβ only depends on x − x(cid:48), as is the case for
homogeneous nonlocal media, invertibility can be checked by Fourier transforming.

(cid:90)

For nonstationary media, whose properties vary with time, a similar approach can
be used as for nonlocal media [14]. Working in the time domain instead of in the
frequency domain, the elements of the response matrix for stationary media is given by

Dα(x, t) =

˜Rαβ(x, x(cid:48), t − t(cid:48))Fβ(x(cid:48), t(cid:48))dt(cid:48)dV (cid:48).

(11)

(cid:90) (cid:90) t− |x−x(cid:48)|

Time varying medium properties can be included by allowing for other time dependences
than t − t(cid:48) in the response matrix and the conditions for duality symetry become.

˜γjk(x, x(cid:48), t, t(cid:48)) = 0,

‡ The extra phase ei ω|r−r(cid:48)|
compared to Landau & Lifshitz appears because they assume the electric
ﬁeld at one point can aﬀect the polarisation elsewhere instantaneously whereas we assume that a ﬁeld
can only inﬂuence points in its future light cone. For the discussion of duality symmetry this diﬀerence
does not matter.

Where each entry is an integral operator. An important diﬀerence between thestationary
and the nonstationary case is in the stationary case one can assume to be working with
monochromatic light and require duality symmetry to hold only for the frequency of
interest wheras in the nonstationary case the frequency of light can change and duality
symmetry must apply broadband.

The conserved quantity and current associated with duality symmetry are the
helicity density and ﬂux. We propose the to generalise these quantities in a linear
medium in the following way:

(cid:0)µ−1A∗ • B − C∗ • D(cid:1) ,
(cid:0)µ−1E × A∗ + H × C∗(cid:1) .

H =

ΦH =

(13)
The only addition made compared to previous works [2, 3, 4, 5] is the factor µ−1, which
modiﬁes only one of the two terms. Substituting these expressions into the continuity
equations and using Maxwell’s equations yields

+ ∇ • ΦH = −2Re(µ−1E∗ • B) + 2Re(H∗ • D).

(14)
Now assuming duality symmetry, B = µH + iGE and D = E − iGH. Assuming
Hermiticity of ˆR, G is a real symmetric matrix. This gives

+ ∇ • ΦH = −2Re(µ−1E∗ • iGE) + 2Re(H∗ • −iGH) = 0.

(15)

This shows that our helicity is indeed locally conserved if the medium is duality
symmetric and if the response matrix is Hermitian, that is,
if there is no gain or
absorption.

3. Properties of duality symmetry preserving interfaces and media

Duality symmetric media interact in a unique way with light. An achiral duality
symmetric optical element can (if it exists) manipulate light without aﬀecting its its
polarisation. To illustrate this property, we will give two simple examples: reﬂection
and transmission oﬀ a duality symmetric ﬂat interface and the propagation of light
through a duality symmetric uniaxial crystal.

Consider the interface between two achiral media. The Fresnel coeﬃcients are [15]

Duality symmetry implies that the Fresnel coeﬃcients are the same for both
polarisations on the interface under consideration. Filling in  and µ for the media
under consideration shows this and also simpliﬁes the Fresnel coeﬁcients:

r⊥,(cid:107) =

cos θi − cos θt
cos θi + cos θt

,

t⊥,(cid:107) =

2 cos θi

cos θi + cos θt

.

(17)

The refractive index appears only implicitly via Snel’s law.

These expressions can also be generalised to chiral duality symmetric interfaces.
In that case it is useful to consider circularly rather than linearly polarised light. The
Fresnel coeﬃcients follow from the following continuity equations [16]

cos θi ˆx + iˆy = tR(cos θt ˆx + iˆy) + rR(− cos θi ˆx + iˆy),
cos θi ˆx − iˆy = tL(cos θt ˆx − iˆy) + rL(− cos θi ˆx − iˆy).

From these one obtains

rR =

cos θi − cos θt
cos θi + cos θt

,

tR =

2 cos θi

cos θi + cos θt

(18)

(19)

and identical expressions for the left handed polarisation, the only diﬀerence being that
θt assumes a diﬀerent value for left and right handed polarisations.
It is interesting
to note that for normal
incidence r = 0 and both polarisations are transmitted
perfectly. This can be understood by noting that due to rotational symmetry the
angular momentum component perpendicular to the interface is conserved. Reﬂection
of circularly polarised light at normal incidence ﬂips the spin angular momentum and
therefore may not occur. Alternatively, the perfect transmission can be understood using
the optical impedance [17]. Interpreting E(cid:107)
H(cid:107) as an impedance, one obtains the laws for
transmission of an electric signal through an electronic circuit, with transmission being
perfect if the impedances of both media are equal. By virtue of the duality symmetry
condition  ∝ µ this impedance matching condition is automatically satisﬁed for light
at normal incidence.

Another interesting situation to study is the propagation of light through a uniaxial
duality symmetric crystal. In most uniaxial crystals, light is separated into an ordinary
ray, for which the wave vector is the propagation direction, and an extraordinary ray
for which the propagation direction is diﬀerent from the wave vector.
In a duality
symmetric crystal, both rays propagate in the same direction, which is diﬀerent from
the wave vector. Both rays can be viewed as ‘equally extraordinary’. This can be
shown as follows. Choose your coordinate system such that the optic axis lies along the
z-axis and the wave vector of the light ray under consideration in the xz-plane. The
permittivity and permeability can now be written as  = α−1 diag(c−1⊥ , c−1⊥ , c−1(cid:107) ) and
µ = α diag(c−1⊥ , c−1⊥ , c−1(cid:107) ), where α is chosen such that the common factor among  and
µ has the dimension of inverse velocity. One can ﬁnd two sets of plane wave solutions,
the ﬁrst one for which E1 points in the y-direction and the second one for which H2
points in the y-direction.

Figure 1. Comparison between the passage of rays through an ordinary dielectric
uniaxial crystal (left) and a duality symmetric uniaxial crystal (right). In an ordinary
uniaxial crystal an incident unpolarised light ray gets separated into two linear
orthogonally polarised rays, one of which is shifted relative to the incident ray.
In
a duality symmetric crystal this separation does not occur and both rays get shifted
by the same amount.

From Maxwell’s equations, one has Dj = − 1
expressions and  and µ, one can compute H1 and E2.

So rays of both polarisations propagate in the same direction which diﬀers from the
direction of the wave vector.

4. The separation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in a right handed and a left
handed ﬁeld

For a duality symmetric medium, there exists another way to write Maxwell’s equations
in a simple and insightful form which we will now show. Start by introducing the
following right and left handed ﬁelds R and L and their corresponding refractive indices
nR and nL:

remove the ambiguity of a square root of a matrix by replacing(cid:112) µ

When applying these ﬁelds and refractive indices in an anisotropic medium, one can
µ by

either α or α−1µ. With these ﬁelds the divergence laws take following form

 by α−1 and

In a duality symmetric medium,

µ can be taken in front of the divergence operator

and the divergence laws can be rewritten as

∇ • (nRR) = 0,

∇ • (nLL) = 0.

(25)

More interesting are the curl laws, which become, after some algebra,

Again, if the medium is duality symmetric, a factor of

diﬀerential operators and these equations simplify to

µ can be taken in front of all

(27)

When written in this form, it is clear that for a duality symetric medium, right and
left handed light ﬁelds are completely decoupled and obey their own ﬁeld equations.
Moreover, one can show that any plane wave solution has R rotating counterclockwise
(with the wave vector pointing toward you) and L rotating clockwise, thus veriﬁyng
that they indeed contain only resp. right and left handed contributions.

Like the ﬁelds, the vector potentials can be rewritten in left and right handed
contributions as well. Starting out with the magnetic four vector potential (A0, A) and
the electric four vector potential (C0, C) with −∇ × C = D and − ˙C − ∇C0 = H, we
deﬁne left and right handed four vector potentials (Λ0, Λ) and (∆0, ∆) as

(cid:18)
(cid:18)

(Λ0, Λ) =

From these deﬁnitions follow
˙Λ + ∇Λ0 = −L,
˙∆ + ∇∆0 = −R,

which are similar to the normal relations between vector potentials and ﬁelds.
It is
insightful to rewrite the helicity density and ﬂux in terms of these new ﬁelds and
potentials.

These show that the helicity is the diﬀerence between left and right handed
contributions, which is perfectly in line with the the deﬁnition of helicity as the diﬀerence
in the number of left and right handed circularly polarised photons.

5. Discussion
The condition  ∝ µ cannot be genercially satisﬁed for two diﬀerent materials, ﬁrst
because for most materials µ is close to its vacuum value for most frequencies, whereas
 varies from material to material. Even for materials with strong magnetic responses
 and µ cannot be typically proportional across two materials. The reason is that any
realistic material is absorbing, which means that the imaginary parts of  and µ are
nonzero. So there are four parameters§ that have to be proportional to each other. One
of them can be used to set the proportionality constant across the interface, leaving
three constraints. If the only thing one can do is varying the frequency of the light used,
one constraint can be satisﬁed (provided all parameters vary enough with frequency),
leaving two unsatisﬁed constraints.

Designing (superconducting [18]) metamaterials with the desired properties allows
to satisfy all constraints within manufacturing tolerance[19, 20]. In this case duality
symmetry can be considered an approximate symmetry rather than an exact symmetry.
The only nontrivial case(cid:107) where duality symmetry is exactly satisﬁed, is a system
consisting made of a chiral material and the same material with opposite chirality. One
can expand the light ﬁeld in a left handed and a right handed component, and verify that
both components experience a change in refractive index as they pass from the right
handed to the left handed material or vice versa, yet duality symmetry is obviously
preserved here.

Apart from the above situations, duality symmetry in media is mainly of theoretical
interest, because of the central role its associated conserved quantity, helicity, plays in
the description of the photon spin.
