The suitability of a particular material for use in magnetic devices is determined by the process
of magnetization reversal/relaxation, which in turn depends on the magnetic anisotropy. Therefore,
designing new ways to control magnetic anisotropy in technologically important materials is highly
desirable. Here we show that magnetic anisotropy of epitaxial thin-ﬁlms of half-metallic ferromagnet
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) is determined by the proximity to thermodynamic equilibrium conditions
during growth. We performed a series of X-ray diﬀraction and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)
experiments in two diﬀerent sets of samples: the ﬁrst corresponds to LSMO thin-ﬁlms deposited
under tensile strain on (001) SrTiO3 by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD; far from thermodynamic
equilibrium); the second were deposited by a slow Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) method,
under quasi-equilibrium conditions. Thin ﬁlms prepared by PLD show a in-plane cubic anisotropy
with an overimposed uniaxial term. A large anisotropy constant perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane
was also observed in these ﬁlms. However, the uniaxial anisotropy is completely suppressed in the
CSD ﬁlms. The out of plane anisotropy is also reduced, resulting in a much stronger in plane
cubic anisotropy in the chemically synthesized ﬁlms. This change is due to a diﬀerent rotation
pattern of MnO6 octahedra to accomodate epitaxial strain, which depends not only on the amount
of tensile stress imposed by the STO substrate, but also on the growth conditions. Our results
demonstrate that the nature and magnitude of the magnetic anisotropy in LSMO can be tuned by
the thermodynamic parameters during thin-ﬁlm deposition.

INTRODUCTION

level.

Recent developments in thin-ﬁlm growth showed the
enormous potential of epitaxial stress to tune the prop-
erties of thin ﬁlms at a very fundamental
In
perovskite oxides, ABO3, strain accommodation occurs
through a complex rotation and deformation of corner
sharing BO6 octahedra1–3. This changes the delicate
balance of bond-distances and angles and therefore the
relative orbital occupation supporting a given magnetic
or electrical interaction4–10. Interfacial phenomena like
heterogeneous catalysis reactions11, and electronic recon-
structions occurring at functional interfaces12, are also
inﬂuenced by these eﬀects.

An interesting example given its scientiﬁc relevance
is the case of half-metallic ferromagnet La0.7Sr0.3MnO3
(LSMO). Growing epitaxial LSMO on cubic (001) SrTiO3
(STO) results in an orthorhombic (with a monoclinic dis-
tortion) unit cell of the magnetic oxide1,13 . Biaxial ten-
sile stress (a=b>c) imposed by the cubic substrate to
the incommensurate rhombohedral lattice of bulk LSMO
induces an equal in-(out-) phase rotation of the MnO6
octahedra along the a-(b-) axis, and no rotation along
the c-axis (a+a−c0 in the Glazer notation14). Sandiu-
menge et al.3 proposed a complex relaxation pattern in
which several phases with diﬀerent symmetry can be dis-
tinguished in epitaxial LSMO below 25 nm. These au-

thors identiﬁed a critical thickness ≈ 2 nm for the build
up of a shear strain ﬁeld, which induces a rhombohedral
twined structure and a progressive compression of the
c-axis up to ≈10 nm. Beyond this thickness, an elastic
deformation of the lattice without any perturbation of
the octahedral tilting sets up to ≈25 nm. Vailionis et
al.15 conﬁrmed that the mechanism of strain relaxation
changes along the ﬁlm thickness, due to a combined eﬀect
of symmetry mismatch close to the interface, and lattice
mismatch in the ”bulk” of the ﬁlm. They showed that
in the ﬁrst ≈two unit cells, stress suppresses octahedral
rotations and expands the c-axis parameter; farther away
from the interface, tilting of MnO6 octahedra reduce the
c-axis parameter consistent with in-plane tensile strain.

An important question is whether this complex relax-
ation pattern is intrinsic to the accommodation of biax-
ial tensile stress in LSMO, or if it can be modiﬁed by
growing the ﬁlms under very diﬀerent conditions, thus
allowing the system to explore diﬀerent relaxation paths.
After all, previous studies were performed on samples
synthesized by PLD and sputtering, far from thermo-
dynamic equilibrium. Here we describe a comparative
X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) and Ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR) study of LSMO thin ﬁlms deposited on STO by
Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD; far from thermodynamic
equilibrium), and by a slow chemical deposition method
(CSD; close to thermodynamic equilibrium). Our results

demonstrate that magnetic anisotropy in LSMO depends
on the conditions during ﬁlm growth. As a result, a diﬀer-
ent patter of rotation of MnO6 octahedra is accomodated
in epitaxial ﬁlms synthesized by CSD.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Thin ﬁlms of LSMO of diﬀerent thicknesses were grown
on (001) TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 (STO) substrates. For
the PLD ﬁlmms we used an excimer laser (F-Kr, 248 nm)
operating at 5 Hz and a ﬂuence of 0.8 J/cm2. The ﬁlms
were deposited at 800 oC and 200 mTorr of O2. For chem-
ically grown ﬁlms (CSD), a precursor solution was spun-
coated on similar substrates, and annealed at high tem-
perature, as described in16. The thickness of both type of
ﬁlms was determined by X-ray reﬂectivity and TEM anal-
ysis of cross-section lamellae. X-band(ω/2π ∼9.4 GHz)
FMR experiments were performed in a Bruker-X spec-
trometer at diﬀerent temperatures, with the magnetic
ﬁeld applied rotating paralell to the ﬁlm-plane.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In Figure 1 we show a summary of structural results
representative of the quality of the samples studied in
this work. X-ray reciprocal space maps (RSM) around
the (103) reﬂection of the perovskite for ≈ 20 nm thick
ﬁlms show that they grow with in-plane lattice param-
eters well matched to the STO substrate, and without
evidence of lattice relaxation (Figure 1a), c)). This is
true for every ﬁlm studied in this work, irrespective of
the thickness or the deposition method (CSD or PLD).
A high-resolution cross-section TEM image of a thin ﬁlm
of LSMO synthesized by CSD is shown in Figure 1b).
The image is representative of the good crystalline qual-
ity and abrupt interfaces of all the CSD ﬁlms reported in
this work.

The dependence of the lattice parameters on the thick-
ness is shown in Figure 1d). The c-axis length shows a
non-monotonic dependence with the ﬁlm thickness, pass-
ing through a minimum between 10 and 15 nm. Similar
behavior was previously reported by Sandiumenge et al.3
for LSMO ﬁlms synthesized by rf-sputtering. These au-
thors suggested that tm marks a crossover from a mono-
clinic to a homogeneously strained rhombohedral phase.
Our results show that the existence of this minimum oc-
curs for PLD and CSD samples, therefore suggesting a
universal relaxation mechanism depending only on the
total strain imposed by the substrate. However, the in-
commensurability of rhombohedral LSMO to the cubic
(001) surface of STO has been suggeseted to result in
an orthorhombic symmetry with a monoclinic distortion
(P21/m)13.
In order to identify the crystal structure
in our ﬁlms, we have performed a careful XRD analy-
sis around diﬀerent half order reﬂections.
(H/2, K/2,
L/2) reﬂections are characteristic of a monoclinic or tri-

clinic symmetry, with H=K=L being an extinction for
the rhombohedral R-3C group. For the 20 nm thick sam-
ple prepared by PLD, we observed a clear signal around
the (1/2,1/2, 1/2) and (1/2, 1/2, 3/2) reﬂections, as
shown in Figure 2. These are consistent with a rhom-
bohedral (R-3c) phase, with a monoclinic distortion. Al-
though the (1/2,0,1) and (1,0,1/2) reﬂections have not
been observed in our ﬁlms, a orthorhombic phase cannot
be completely discarded due to the small intensity char-
acteristic of these reﬂections, particularly in thin-ﬁlms.
On the other hand, half order reﬂections at L=3/2 and
absence at L=1/2 in ﬁlms prepared by CSD are consis-
tent with a dominant rhombohedral (R-3c) phase. Also,
from the analysis of in-plane (200) and (110) peaks, a
fully structural coherence with the substrate is observed
along the whole thickness of the ﬁlms prepared by CSD
(see Figure 3). No satellites peaks or diﬀuse scattering
associated to twinnigs or strong mosaicity are observed
in these samples.

Given the equal in-plane tensile stress impossed by the
substrate along the a/b directions, these structural re-
sults therefore suggests a diﬀerent rotation pattern of
the MnO6 octahedra to accommodate the tensile stress
in samples synthesized by CSD with respect to PLD. We
want to remark that this result is reproducible in diﬀerent
samples prepared from CSD under similar conditions.

The structural diﬀerence reported in Figure 2 is also
manifested in the magnetic properties of the CSD and
PLD ﬁlms (see Figure 4). The magnetic moment at sat-
uration and the Curie temperature (Tc) of ≈ 20 nm thick
ﬁlms are close to the bulk values (590 emu/cm3 and 350
K) and are very similarity in both sets of samples, dis-
carding any signiﬁcant variation in their stoichiometry.

parameters with thickness was studied indirectly by fer-
romagnetic resonance. FMR is a technique very sensitive
to small variations in the magnitude of the diﬀerent mag-
netic anisotropy terms. Diﬀerent rotation patterns of the
MnO6 octahedra along diﬀerent directions of the crystal
will change the orbital overlap and, through spin-orbit
coupling also change the magnetocrystalline anisotropy
of the ﬁlms. We will show that these changes measured
by FMR can be correlated with the structural distortions
in the ﬁlms.

The angular dependence of the resonance ﬁeld (Hr) in
a FMR experiment can be evaluated at the magnetization
equilibrium angles, θ0 and φ0 for the diﬀerent orientation
of the magnetic ﬁeld17:

However, the coercive ﬁeld (Hc) shows a completely dif-
ferent behavior: while the samples synthesized by PLD
show a very small, bulk-like, Hc ≈ 50-100 Oe, it increases
by an order of magnitude in the ﬁlms synthesized by
CSD. Therefore, the change in Hc probably implies dif-
ferent magnetocrystalline anisotropy between the CSD
and PLD ﬁlms. This could be due to diﬀerences in the
strength of Mn-O-Mn exchange interactions along diﬀer-
ent directions of the crystal, as a result of the structural
diﬀerences identiﬁed before. However, to give a deﬁni-
tive proof of this subtle structural distortion in thin-ﬁlms
prepared by diﬀerent methods is very challenging using
conventional laboratory XRD equipment.

To avoid this diﬃculty, the evolution of the structural

vacuum permeability is given by µ0, and θ and φ are the
polar and azimuthal angles of the magnetization vector,
according to the scheme of Figure 5.
In this way the
values of K IP
4 , Ku, and Kout can be determined from
ﬁttings of experimental Hr(θ,φ) curves by solving self-
consistently Eq. (1) and (2).19

Following the formalism explained above, the thickness
dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy in our
ﬁlms were obtained from FMR experiments with H ro-
tating in the plane of the ﬁlms, i.e. φH =0-360o, θH =90o.
The experiments were performed at 200 K, except for the
thinner samples, which were taken at 150 K to ensure
that the samples are completely magnetized at the reso-
nance ﬁeld. The FMR spectra show a single Lorentzian
line in all cases, except for thinner CSD ﬁlms (see Figure
5). In this case two broad overimposed lines precludes the
accurate analysis of their resonance ﬁeld, so we excluded
these samples from the discussion.

The angular dependence of Hr(φH , θH =90o) is shown
in Figures 6 and 7. All samples show a clear biaxial
anisotropy with the easy axis along the < 110 > direction
of STO (the diagonal directions of the (001) substrate),
and the hard axis coinciding with the < 100 > directions
of STO (the sides of the substrates), which is in agree-
ment with previous reports20,21. Note that contrary to
magnetization, in a FMR experiment the maximum and
minimum of Hr mark the hard and easy magnetization
axis directions, respectively. The ﬁtting to Eq. (1) and
(2) is also shown as continuous lines over the experimen-
tal data. To improve the accuracy of the ﬁtting, the val-
ues of the saturation magnetization were obtained from
the experimental M(H) measurements in each sample, at
the same temperature as the FMR experiments. Also the
g−factor was set to g = 2.0, as generally observed in bulk

La0.7Sr0.3MnO3

22,23.

The anisotropy constants obtained from the ﬁttings
are listed in Table I. All PLD ﬁlms, irrespective of their
thickness, are characterized by a biaxial anisotropy con-
4 ≈2 kJ/m3, plus an order of magnitude smaller
stant K IP
uniaxial anisotropy Ku. The existence of these two
anisotropy terms was previously reported from magne-
tization measurements in LSMO under tensile strain by
several authors1,20,24,25. The monoclinically distorted
unit cell of LSMO results from a diﬀerent rotation pat-
tern of the MnO6 octahedra along the < 110 > axis
(a+a−c0). This produces an important diﬀerence in the
magnitude of the orbital overlap along the equivalent
< 110 > easy axis directions, introducing the extra uni-
axial anisotropy term. We also identiﬁed fro this analysis
an important out of plane anisotropy constant Kout. This
term may have its origin in the contribution of diﬀerent
factors, like magnetocrystalline anisotropy18,26, interface
eﬀects27, domain shape28, or most probably in this case,
interfacial stress29. Although this eﬀect is normally ne-
glected, we show here that it can be an appreciable con-
tribution in epitaxially stressed ﬁlms.

On the other hand, the situation is completely diﬀerent
in the ﬁlms synthesized by CSD: the value of K IP
is much
larger in these ﬁlms compared to PLD, and most im-
portant, the uniaxial anisotropy term vanishes, Ku ≈0.
The out of plane anisotropy constant Kout is also much
smaller than in the PLD ﬁlms, reﬂecting a diﬀerent con-
tribution from interfacial epitaxial stress. A larger in-
plane cubic anisotropy is in qualitative agreement with
larger in-plane coercivity, as observed in Figure 4. How-
ever, the estimated HC ∼ 2K 4
ip/M for these ﬁlms is in the
80-200 Oe range, smaller than observed, which calls for

In summary, we have demonstrated that the char-

anisotropy can be completely suppressed in chemically

prepared thin-ﬁlms of LSMO. This implies diﬀerent
mechanisms of octahedral rotation to accommodate the
biaxial tensile stress, depending on the growth condi-
tions. Magnetic anisotropy determines the switching and
relaxation of magnetization, and therefore the results
presented here are not only interesting from a fundamen-
tal point of view, but they must be considered for appli-
cations of half-metallic ferromagnet LSMO in diﬀerent
types of devices. Finally, we would like to remark the
enormous possibilities oﬀered by the sensitivity of FMR
for the indirect study of subtle structural changes in ul-
trathin ﬁlms, using conventional laboratory equipment.

further relevant eﬀect of magnetic inhomogeneities which
could act as pinning centers for domain walls30. This is
also consistent with the much wider FMR lines observed
in CSD with respect to PLD ﬁlms.

Following the argument before, the absence of Ku in
CSD ﬁlms indicate a similar orbital overlap along the
< 110 > axis, which in turn requires an equivalent rota-
tion of the MnO6 octahedra along the a and b axis. The
most plausible possibility is a+a+c0 (Glazer tilt system
number 16), compatible with unit cell parameters a=b>c
under tensile stress (tetragonal, space group I4/mmm)
and our previous X-ray analysis (see Figure 2). The re-
sults of CSD are then consistent with an elastic deforma-
tion of LSMO, without any signiﬁcant anisotropy in the
octahedral tilting along the direction of the easy axis.

The arrangements of MnO6 octahedra compatible with
the analysis of the experimental FMR and XRD in epi-
taxial ﬁlms of LSMO synthesized by PLD and CSD are
