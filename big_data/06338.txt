We provide a generalization of the Lie algebra of conformal Killing vector ﬁelds to conformal
Killing-Yano forms. A new Lie bracket for conformal Killing-Yano forms that corresponds to slightly
modiﬁed Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket of diﬀerential forms is proposed. We show that conformal
Killing-Yano forms satisfy a graded Lie algebra in constant curvature manifolds. It is also proven
that normal conformal Killing-Yano forms in Einstein manifolds also satisfy a graded Lie algebra.
The constructed graded Lie algebras reduce to the graded Lie algebra of Killing-Yano forms and the
Lie algebras of conformal Killing and Killing vector ﬁelds in special cases.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Killing vector ﬁelds generate the isometries of a given manifold. Their ﬂows preserve the metric deﬁned on it
and the number of Killing vectors correspond to the symmetries of the manifold. The manifolds that have maximal
number of Killing vectors are called maximally symmetric. Under the Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds, Killing vectors
satisfy a Lie algebra that corresponds to the Lie algebra of the isometry group of the manifold. Similarly, the vector
ﬁelds that preserve a conformal class of metrics are called conformal Killing vector ﬁelds. They also form a Lie
algebra with respect to the Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds which is called the conformal algebra. Killing vector ﬁelds
correspond to a subset of conformal Killing vector ﬁelds. Besides the symmetric tensor generalizations called Killing
tensors and conformal Killing tensors, they also have antisymmetric generalizations called Killing-Yano (KY) forms
and conformal Killing-Yano (CKY) forms respectively [1, 2]. There are various aspects of them that have importance
in physical problems. For example, the ﬁrst integrals of the geodesic motion of a particle can be constructed from
KY forms [3]. They are also used in the construction of symmetry operators of the massive Dirac equation in
curved backgrounds [4, 5]. Similarly CKY forms are used for the symmetry operator construction of massless Dirac
equation [6]. Conserved gravitational currents which are constructed from KY forms and curvature characteristics
of the manifold can be related to p-brane charges [7–9]. Moreover, the p-form Dirac currents of geometric Killing
spinors correspond to KY forms and they can be used in the construction of superalgebras in supersymmetric ﬁeld
theories [10–12]. Similary, the p-form Dirac currents of twistor spinors are CKY forms and can be related to conformal
superalgebras in supergravity backgrounds [10, 13].

Lie algebra of Killing vectors can be generalized to KY forms in constant curvature manifolds. They satisfy a
graded Lie algebra structure under Schouten-Nijenhuis (SN) bracket in those cases [14]. This corresponds to the
extended symmetry algebra of the background. However, there is no known result for the extension of the Lie algebra
of conformal Killing vectors to CKY forms. In this paper, we propose a Lie bracket for CKY forms and show that
they satisfy a graded Lie algebra or a Lie superalgebra under this bracket in constant curvature manifolds. For the
subset of KY forms, it reduces to the graded Lie algebra of KY forms with respect to the SN bracket. Moreover,
a subset of CKY forms which are called normal CKY forms also satisfy a graded Lie algebra in Einstein manifolds
with respect to the deﬁned bracket. This provides a ﬁrst step for the construction of conformal superalgebras that
include the graded Lie algebra of CKY forms which are extensions of the conformal superalgebras constructed out of
conformal Killing vectors.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we consider the CKY equation and its integrability conditions
in terms of the curvature characteristics of the manifold. We also deﬁne the subset of normal CKY forms and the
relevant integrability conditions. In Section 3, we propose a Lie bracket for CKY forms and show that the bracket of
two normal CKY forms is also a normal CKY form in Einstein manifolds and it is a CKY form for all CKY forms
in constant curvature manifolds. We also show the graded Lie bracket and Lie superalgebra properties of the new
bracket. Section 4 concludes the paper.

II. CKY FORMS AND INTEGRABILITY CONDITIONS

A p-form ω is a CKY p-form in an n-dimensional manifold, if it satisﬁes the following equation which is the

antisymmetric generalization of conformal Killing equation to higher-degree diﬀerential forms

2

∇X ω =

1

p + 1

iXdω −

1

n − p + 1 eX ∧ δω

where X is any vector ﬁeld, eX its metric dual, ∇ is the Levi-Civita connection, iX is the interior derivative or

contraction with respect to X, d and δ are exterior derivative and co-derivative operators respectively. Co-closed
CKY forms, namely δω = 0, correspond to KY forms.

CKY equation is invariant under Hodge star operation which is denoted by *. If ω is a CKY p-form, then ∗ω is a

CKY (n − p)-form in an n-dimensional manifold and we have the following equation

(1)

(2)

(3)

∇X ∗ ω =

1

n − p + 1

iX d ∗ ω −

1

p + 1 eX ∧ δ ∗ ω.

This can be seen from the properties of * and the equality ∇X ∗ = ∗∇X. CKY equation is also covariant under
conformal rescalings of the metric. If ω is a CKY p-form in a background with metric g, then for a background with

from (1) by using the following relations between operators deﬁned for the metric g and conformally rescaled metric

metric bg = e2λg, the p-form bω = e(p+1)λω is again a CKY p-form where λ is a function. This can be proven directly
bg

b∇X ω = ∇X ω − pX(λ)ω − dλ ∧ iXω + eX ∧ ifdλω
bdω = dω
bδω = δω − (n − 2p)ifdλω.

Integrability conditions of CKY forms can be obtained by taking second derivatives of the CKY equation [15]. The

curvature operator on a manifold is deﬁned as follows

R(X, Y ) = [∇X , ∇Y ] − ∇[X,Y ]

(4)

where X and Y are arbitrary vector ﬁelds. For the ease of calculations, we will choose a frame basis Xa in normal
coordinates, so the connection coeﬃcients will be zero and we have ∇Xa Xb = 0 = [Xa, Xb]. By taking the second
covariant derivative of (1), we obtain

∇Xa ∇Xb ω =

iXb∇Xa dω −

n − p + 1

n − p + 1

∇Xa (eb ∧ δω)

eb ∧ ∇Xa δω

(5)

where eb is coframe basis with the property eb(Xa) = δba and we have used the relation [iX , ∇Y ] = i∇X Y . By using
(5), the action of the curvature operator on a CKY p-form can be obtained in the following form

R(Xa, Xb)ω = ∇Xa ∇Xb ω − ∇Xb ∇Xa ω

=

1

p + 1

(iXb ∇Xa − iXa ∇Xb ) dω −

1

n − p + 1

(eb ∧ ∇Xa − ea ∧ ∇Xb ) δω.

By taking the wedge product with ea, (6) transforms into

ea ∧ R(Xa, Xb)ω = −

p

p + 1

∇Xb dω +

1

n − p + 1

eb ∧ dδω

(6)

(7)

where we have used the relations ea ∧ iXa ω = pω and ea ∧ ∇Xa ω = dω with the deﬁnition of the Lie derivative
LX = iX d + diX and the properties [LX , d] = 0 and d2 = 0. Since the action of the curvature operator on a p-form
can be written in terms of curvature 2-forms Rab as ea ∧ R(Xa, Xb)ω = −Rab ∧ iX a ω (see [8]), the ﬁrst integrability
condition of the CKY equation is obtained as follows

∇Xa dω =

p + 1

p(n − p + 1)

ea ∧ dδω +

p + 1

p

Rba ∧ iX b ω.

(8)

On the other hand, by taking the interior product of (6) with iX a we obtain

iXaR(Xa, Xb)ω =

1

p + 1

iXb δdω +

n − p

n − p + 1

∇Xb δω

3

(9)

where we have used the relations iXa iXb = −iXbiXa and iX a∇Xa = −δ with δ2 = 0. Since the action of the curvature
operator on ω can be written in terms of curvature 2-forms Rab and Ricci 1-forms Pb = iX a Rab as iX a R(Xa, Xb)ω =
iXc Pb ∧ iX c ω + iXc Rab ∧ iX a iX c ω, the second integrability condition of the CKY equation is found as

∇Xa δω = −

n − p + 1

(p + 1)(n − p)

iXa δdω +

n − p + 1

n − p

(iXb Pa ∧ iX bω + iXb Rca ∧ iX c iX bω) .

(10)

In fact, by using the deﬁnitions δdω = −iX a∇Xa dω and dδω = ea ∧ ∇Xa δω, the integrability conditions (8) and (10)
can be combined into the following equality

p

p + 1

δdω +

n − p

n − p + 1

dδω = Pa ∧ iX a ω + Rab ∧ iX a iX bω

(11)

where we have used the identities iXa Pb = iXb Pa and iXa Rbc + iXb Rca + iXc Rab = 0 which are relevant for zero
torsion.

A subset of CKY forms can be deﬁned in terms of the following 1-form which plays an important role in conformal

geometry and corresponds to the metric dual of the so-called Schouten tensor

A. Normal CKY forms

Ka =

1

n − 2(cid:18) R

2(n − 1)

ea − Pa(cid:19)

(12)

where R = iX a Pa is the curvature scalar. A CKY p-form ω is called a normal CKY p-form, if it satisﬁes the following
integrability conditions besides the CKY equation [16, 17]

∇Xa dω =

p + 1

p(n − p + 1)

ea ∧ dδω + 2(p + 1)Ka ∧ ω

∇Xa δω = −

n − p + 1

(p + 1)(n − p)

iXa δdω − 2(n − p + 1)iX bKa ∧ iXb ω.

These correspond to special cases of (8) and (10). For normal CKY forms, (11) is written as

p

p + 1

δdω +

n − p

n − p + 1

dδω = −2(n − p)Ka ∧ iX a ω.

(13)

(14)

(15)

Moreover, in constant curvature manifols, (13) and (14) are equal to (8) and (10) respectively. This can be seen as
follows. For a constant curvature manifold, the curvature 2-forms are written as Rab = R
n(n−1) ea ∧ eb and the Ricci
1-forms are Pa = R

n ea. So, the curvature parts of (8) and (10) are written as

n − p + 1

n − p

(iXb Pa ∧ iX bω + iXbRca ∧ iX c iX bω) =

p + 1

p

Rba ∧ iX b ω = −

Rea ∧ ω

p + 1

n(n − 1)
n − p + 1
n(n − 1)

and the right hand sides of (16) are also equivalent to the curvature terms in (13) and (14)

2(p + 1)Ka ∧ ω = −

Rea ∧ ω

−2(n − p + 1)iX bKa ∧ iXbω =

RiXa ω.

p + 1

n(n − 1)
n − p + 1
n(n − 1)

(16)

(17)

This means that in constant curvature manifolds, all CKY forms are normal CKY forms. So, in that case the
integrability conditions are written in the following form

III. A LIE BRACKET FOR CKY FORMS

(18)

(19)

(20)

Killing vector ﬁelds and conformal Killing vector ﬁelds constitute a Lie algebra structure under the ordinary Lie

bracket of vector ﬁelds. It is deﬁned for the vector ﬁelds X and Y as follows

[X, Y ] = ∇X Y − ∇Y X.

The natural generalization of the Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds to higher-degree diﬀerential forms is the SN bracket and
it is deﬁned for a p-form α and a q-form β as

[α, β]SN = iXa α ∧ ∇X a β + (−1)p∇Xa α ∧ iX a β.

(21)

The SN bracket has the graded Lie bracket properties and it is known that KY forms satisfy a graded Lie algebra
under SN bracket in constant curvature spacetimes [14]. However, there is no known such a result about the Lie
algebra structure of antisymmetric generalizations of conformal Killing vectors that are CKY forms. Although it
can be thought that the SN bracket can provide a graded Lie algebra structure for CKY forms as a generalization
of ordinary Lie bracket of conformal Killing vector ﬁelds, this is not the case even in constant curvature manifolds.
Instead of this, we propose another generalization of the Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds which is slightly diﬀerent from
the SN bracket and provide a graded Lie algebra structure for CKY forms in some special cases. The bracket that we
propose for a CKY p-form ω1 and a CKY q-form ω2 is the following

[ω1, ω2]CKY =

1

q + 1

iXa ω1 ∧ iX a dω2 +

iXa dω1 ∧ iX a ω2

(−1)p
p + 1

1

+

(−1)p

n − q + 1

ω1 ∧ δω2 +

n − p + 1

δω1 ∧ ω2.

(22)

This gives a (p + q − 1)-form and for p = q = 1, it reduces to the Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds. For the subset of KY
forms which correspond to the co-closed CKY forms that have the property δω = 0, this bracket reduces to the SN
bracket of KY forms. However, for general CKY forms, it diﬀers from the SN bracket in terms of the coeﬃcients
of the third and fourth terms in (22). We will show that the CKY bracket deﬁned in (22) is a graded Lie bracket
for normal CKY forms in Einstein manifolds and for all CKY forms in constant curvature manifolds. Namely, they
satisfy the following equality in those cases

∇Xa [ω1, ω2]CKY =

1

p + q

iXa d[ω1, ω2]CKY −

1

n − p − q + 2

ea ∧ δ[ω1, ω2]CKY .

(23)

To prove (23), we ﬁrst calculate the covariant derivative of CKY bracket deﬁned in (22)

∇Xa [ω1, ω2]CKY =

1

q + 1

iXb ∇Xa ω1 ∧ iX bdω2 +

1

q + 1

iXbω1 ∧ iX b∇Xa dω2

(−1)p

n − p + 1

ω1 ∧ ∇Xa δω2

δω1 ∧ ∇Xa ω2

(24)

where we have used [iXb , ∇Xa ] = 0 for normal coordinates. We will use the CKY equation (1) and the integrability
conditions (8) and (10) with deﬁning the following curvature quantities of a p-form ω1 and similarly of a q-form ω2
for the ease of calculations

(25)

(26)

So, we obtain

(29)

Now, we have all the ingredients to check the Lie bracket property of the CKY bracket deﬁned in (22). First, we start
with ﬂat manifolds in which we have all the curvature terms equal to zero Ma = 0 = Na. It can easily be seen that
the non-curvature terms in (27) are equivalent to the non-curvature terms in the sum of (28) and (29). Hence, we
prove that the CKY bracket of CKY p-form ω1 and CKY q-form ω2 is again a CKY (p + q − 1)-form in ﬂat manifolds.
On the other hand, the curvature terms in (27), (28) and (29) are not equal to each other in manifolds of arbitrary
curvature. However, we will see in the next subsection that the Lie bracket property can still be satisﬁed in some
manifolds of special curvature such as constant curvature and Einstein manifolds.

A. Constant curvature manifolds

We ﬁrst consider the manifolds with constant curvature in which the curvature 2-forms are written as Rab =
R

n(n−1) ea ∧ eb. In this case, the curvature terms deﬁned in (25) and (26) transforms into

αpM1a := −

αqM2a := −

γpN1a :=

γqN2a :=

p + 1

n(n − 1)

n(n − 1)
n − q + 1
n(n − 1)

Rea ∧ ω1

Rea ∧ ω2

RiXa ω1

RiXa ω2.

(30)

(31)

From these deﬁnitions, it can easily be seen that the curvature terms in (27) vanishes. Moreover, the sum of the
curvature terms in (28) and (29) are exactly equal to zero. So, this proves that the CKY bracket of two CKY forms
in constant curvature manifolds is again a CKY form.

The second case that we consider is the normal CKY forms in Einstein manifolds. For the normal CKY forms, the

curvature terms deﬁned in (25) and (26) are written as

B. Einstein manifolds

αpM1a := 2(p + 1)Ka ∧ ω1
αqM2a := 2(q + 1)Ka ∧ ω2
γpN1a := −2(n − p + 1)iX bKa ∧ iXb ω1
γqN2a := −2(n − q + 1)iX bKa ∧ iXbω2.

(32)

(33)

So, the curvature terms in (27) are found to be zero

2iXbω1 ∧ (iX bKa ∧ ω2 − Ka ∧ iX bω2) + (−1)p2 (iXb Ka ∧ ω1 − Ka ∧ iXb ω1) ∧ iX bω2
−(−1)p2ω1 ∧ iX bKa ∧ iXb ω2 − 2iX bKa ∧ iXbω1 ∧ ω2
= 0.

7

(34)

We need to prove that the curvature terms in the sum of (28) and (29) also vanish. In Einstein manifolds, the Ricci
1-forms satisfy the relation Pa = R

n ea. Hence, we have

Ka = −

R

2n(n − 1)

and

αpM1a := −

γqN2a :=

Rea ∧ ω2

RiXa ω2.

(35)

(36)

(37)

These are exactly the same as in the case of (30) and (31). So, the curvature terms in the sum of (28) and (29) are
exactly equal to zero. This means that the CKY bracket of two normal CKY forms in Einstein manifolds is again
a CKY form. Moreover, it is a normal CKY form since the curvature characteristics deﬁned in the deﬁnition of
the normal CKY forms in (13) and (14) reduces to the curvature characteristics of ordinary CKY forms in Einstein
manifolds. To prove the Lie algebra structure of CKY forms, we will consider the Lie bracket properties of the CKY
bracket in the next subsection.

C. Lie bracket properties of the CKY bracket

The CKY bracket deﬁned in (22) satisfy the graded Lie bracket properties. Those are the following (skew)-symmetry

condition for a p-form α and a q-form β

[α, β]CKY = (−1)pq[β, α]CKY

(38)

and the graded Jacobi identity

(−1)p(r+1)[α, [β, γ]CKY ]CKY + (−1)q(p+1)[β, [γ, α]CKY ]CKY + (−1)r(q+1)[γ, [α, β]CKY ]CKY = 0

(39)

where γ is an r-form. In fact, one can see from (38) that for odd forms the CKY bracket is a skew-symmetric bracket
while for even forms it is a symmetric bracket. This means that CKY forms in constant curvature manifolds and
normal CKY forms in Einstein manifolds satisfy a Lie superalgebra structure with respect to the CKY bracket.

A Lie superalgebra g = g0 ⊕ g1 consists of an even part g0 which is a Lie algebra and an odd part g1 which is
a vector space that is acted on by g0. There is a bilinear multiplication [., .] on the superalgebra that satisﬁes the
following (skew)-supersymmetry and super-Jacobi identities

[a, b] = −(−1)|a||b|[b, a]

[a, [b, c]] = [[a, b], c] + (−1)|a||b|[b, [a, c]]

(40)

where a, b, c are elements of g and |a| denotes the degree of a which corresponds to 0 or 1 depending on a is in g0
or g1, respectively. For the case of CKY superalgebra, g0 corresponds to the Lie algebra of odd CKY forms and g1
corresponds to the space of even CKY forms. The properties (38) and (39) of the CKY bracket corresponds to the
Lie superalgebra properties in (40).

For the subset of KY forms, namely CKY forms ω that satisfy δω = 0, the CKY superalgebra reduces to the Lie
superalgebra of KY forms with respect to the SN bracket. For p = q = 1, they correspond to the Lie algebra of
conformal Killing vector ﬁelds and Killing vector ﬁelds respectively.

IV. CONCLUSION

8

Lie algebra of Killing vector ﬁelds can be generalized to KY forms in constant curvature manifolds by the SN bracket
of diﬀerential forms. A generalization of the Lie algebra of conformal Killing vector ﬁelds is provided by deﬁning a new
bracket for CKY forms. Although it is similar to the SN bracket, it diﬀers from it in the coeﬃcients of some terms.
By computing the covariant derivative of the CKY bracket and compraring it with the exterior and co-derivatives of
the bracket, it is shown that CKY forms constitute a graded Lie algebra in constant curvature manifolds. A similar
graded Lie algebra structure can also be constructed for normal CKY forms in Einstein manifolds. In fact, they are
Lie superalgebras and the even part of it corresponds to the Lie algebra of odd CKY forms while the odd part of it
is equal to the space of even CKY forms.

The construction of the graded Lie algebra of CKY forms can be related to the investigation of extended super-
algebras in supergravity theories. Killing superalgebras in supergravity backgrounds are constructed out of Killing
spinors and Killing vector ﬁelds. The even part of the superalgebra corresponds to the Lie algebra of Killing vector
ﬁelds. Similiary, conformal superalgebras in supergravity backgrounds can be constructed out of twistor spinors and
conformal Killing vector ﬁelds by using the Lie algebra of conformal Killing vector ﬁelds. They are used for obtaining
results about the classiﬁcation problem of supergravity backgrounds. The construction of the graded Lie algebras of
KY forms and CKY forms can be used to extend the Killing superalgebras to include higher-degree diﬀerential forms.
It is known that the higher-degree Dirac currents of Killing spinors correspond to KY forms while for twistor spinors
they are equal to CKY forms [10]. So, the odd parts of the superalgebras can generate the even parts of them. An
investigation for the extensions of Killing superalgebras in AdS5 background is done in [12]. Similar analysis is under
investigation for conformal superalgebras by using the construction of the graded Lie algebra of CKY forms.
