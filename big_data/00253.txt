Fe5SiB2 has been synthesized and magnetic measurements have been carried out, revealing that
Msat = 0.92 MA/m at T = 300 K. The M vs T curve shows a broad peak around T = 160 K. The
anisotropy constant, K1, estimated at T = 300 K, is 0.25 MJ/m3. Theoretical analysis of Fe5SiB2
system has been carried out and extended to the full range of Fe5Si1−xPxB2, Fe5P1−xSxB2, and
(Fe1−xCox)5SiB2 compositions. The electronic band structures have been calculated using the
Full-Potential Local-Orbital Minimum-Basis Scheme (FPLO-14). The calculated total magnetic mo-
ments are 9.20, 9.15, 9.59 and 2.42µB per formula units of Fe5SiB2, Fe5PB2, Fe5SB2, and Co5SiB2,
respectively. In agreement with experiment, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE’s) cal-
culated for T = 0 K changes from a negative (easy-plane) anisotropy −0.28 MJ/m3 for Fe5SiB2
to the positive (easy-axis) anisotropy 0.35 MJ/m3 for Fe5PB2. Further increase of the number of
p-electrons in Fe5P1−xSxB2 leads to an increase of MAE up to 0.77 MJ/m3 for the hypothetical
Fe5P0.4S0.6B2 composition. Volume variation and ﬁxed spin moment calculations (FSM) performed
for Fe5SiB2 show an inverse relation between MAE and magnetic moment in the region down to
about 15% reduction of the spin moment. The alloying of Fe5SiB2 with Co is proposed as a prac-
tical realization of magnetic moment reduction, which ought to increase MAE. MAE calculated in
virtual crystal approximation (VCA) for a full range of (Fe1−xCox)5SiB2 compositions reaches the
maximum value of 1.16 MJ/m3 at Co concentration x = 0.3, with the magnetic moment 7.75µB per
formula unit. Thus, (Fe0.7Co0.3)5SiB2 is suggested as a candidate for a rare-earth free permanent
magnet. For the stoichiometric Co5SiB2 there is an easy-plane magnetization, with the value of
MAE = −0.15 MJ/m3.

INTRODUCTION

Volatile prices of the rare-earth elements observed in
the recent years have motivated wide research initia-
tives in an eﬀort to ﬁnd replacement materials for the
permanent magnets industry, which would use little or
none of the rare-earth elements. Late 3d transition el-
ements, such as Mn, Fe or Co are the primary candi-
dates for such materials, thanks to their large and stable
magnetic moments and high magnetic transition tem-
peratures found in many of the compounds they form.
However, weak spin-orbital interaction strength typically
causes low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE),
which in turn means that they often lack appreciable co-
ercivity, forming soft magnetic materials. Under certain
circumstances, however, the MAE of 3d transition metal

compounds can be substantial, for example the tetrago-
nally distorted Fe/Co alloys1–5, L10 phases such as FeNi,
CoNi, MnAl6,7, Fe16N2
8, (Fe/Co)2B9–11 or Fe2P-based
alloys12,13. A general overview on rare-earth-free perma-
nent magnets is available in Ref.14. All of the above men-
tioned systems are hexagonal or tetragonal, i.e., uniaxial.
For this reason, in this work we have focused on an iron-
based system Fe5SiB2 and its alloys (Fe1−xCox)5SiB2
and Fe5Si1−xPxB2 - they are tetragonal and rich on mag-
netic elements.

Fe5SiB2

15 and Fe5PB2

16 are isomorphous with Cr5B3.
They were initially reported by Aronsson and En-
gstr¨om15 and Rundqvist16 in 1960 and 1962. Several
other borides crystallize within the same structure type.
In the more general formula X5SiB2 for the silico-borides,
X may stand for (Mn, Fe, Mo)15, V17, Nb18 or W19. The
recently discovered Nb5SiB2 and W5SiB2 have been rec-
ognized as superconductors.
Isomorphous phases with
phosphorus, X5PB2, were identiﬁed with X = (Mn, Fe,

Co)16, Cr20 and Mo21.

to the unit cell boundaries.

The crystal structure of Fe5PB2 was determined by
Rundqvist16 and Fe5SiB2 by Aronsson and Engstr¨om15,
see Fig. 1. Rundqvist stated that the distribution of P
and B atoms in Fe5PB2 was ordered and had a narrow ho-
mogeneity range16. Both Fe5PB2 and Fe5SiB2 crystallize
in the Cr5B3-type structure16 with body-centered tetrag-
onal (bct) unit cell, space group I4/mcm, see Fig. 1(a).
Single unit cell of Fe5XB2 contains 32 atoms divided into
4 formula units. Fe1 atoms are distributed on the 16-fold
position, B on the 8-fold, Fe2 and Si/P on the 4-fold
position, respectively.

The Fe5SiB2 and Fe5PB2 structures have a princi-
pally ordered arrangement of Si/P and B on their respec-
tive crystallographic sites, but some intermixing occurs
as well as interstitial accommodations of B, Si and P.
Furthermore, octahedral holes of suﬃcient size for small
non-metal atoms exist in the system. Aronsson and En-
gstr¨om15 found it likely that some of the boron atoms
may be interstitially accommodated in these holes. More-
over, Rundqvist16 described two types of holes in the
Cr5B3-type lattice, trigonal prismatic and anti-prismatic
ones. In the Fe5PB2 system the radii of the trigonal pris-

2

matic and anti-prismatic holes are 0.93 ˚A and 1.08 ˚A, re-
spectively, while the B radius is 0.88 ˚A. A homogeneity
range of Fe5SiB2 with the substitutions of B for Si has
been observed previously. Fe5SiB2 measured by Arons-
son and Engstr¨om15 have B/Si ratio slightly larger than
2.00. The authors even proposed a new general formula,
Fe5Si1−xB2+x (0 < x < 0.1). Another feature of Fe5XB2
structure is its layered character. The structure is built
up of three types of layers, which alternate along the c-
axis. A single unit cell consists of 8 layers: 2 Fe-B, 4 Fe,
and 2 Si layers, see Fig. 1.

At room temperature Fe5SiB2 and Fe5PB2 are fer-
romagnets with an orientation of spins parallel to the
tetragonal axis22.
The Curie temperature (TC ) is
slightly varying with the deviation from the stoichiom-
23 and
etry (Fe5X1−xB2+x), TC = 628±11 K for Fe5PB2
22. For Fe5PB2 the tetrago-
TC ∼ 784 K for Fe5SiB2
nal easy axis of the magnetization direction is valid from
22. The low temperature M¨ossbauer study
80 K up to TC
of Fe5SiB2 revealed a signiﬁcant change of the spectral
shape in the temperature range of 130 to 150 K22. Eric-
sson et al.22 concluded that below 140 K the spins were
oriented in the ab-plane or close to that. There were
also indications that below 140 K the pure ferromagnetic
coupling is partly destroyed22.
In the temperature re-
gion from 140 K up to TC the Fe5SiB2 was conﬁrmed to
be a ferromagnet with the spins parallel to the c-axis22.
H¨aggstr¨om et al.23 referred that an average magnetic mo-
ment of Fe5PB2 was reported to be 1.73µB per Fe atom.
The individual moments calculated by H¨aggstr¨om et al.
from the values of the magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁelds are 1.6µB
for Fe1 and 2.2µB for Fe2.

To the best of our knowledge there is no literature data

II. EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL

DETAILS

A. Experimental details

Fe5SiB2 samples were prepared with a conventional arc
furnace in an argon atmosphere. Stoichiometric amounts
of iron (Leico Industries, purity 99.995 %, surface ox-
ides were reduced in H2-gas), silicone (Highways Interna-
tional, purity 99.999 %) and zone melted boron (Wacher)
were used as raw materials. The samples were crushed,
pressed into pellets and sealed in silica tubes, annealed
at 1273 K for 19 days and then quenched in cold water.
(XRD) were
recorded using Bruker D8 diﬀractometer with a V˚antec
position sensitive detector with a 4° opening using CuKα1

radiation, λ = 1.540598 ˚A. The measurements were taken
in a 2θ-range of 20-90°. Phase analysis and crystal
structures reﬁnements were performed using the Rietveld
method26 implemented in the software FullProf27 and
cell parameters were reﬁned using the software UNIT-
CELL28.

Magnetization measurements on the powder samples
were performed using a Quantum Design PPMS 6000
Vibrating Sample Magnetometer. The low ﬁeld magne-
tization temperature dependence was recorded between
T = 300 K and T = 10 K at a constant magnetic ﬁeld of
8 kA/m. The magnetization, M , vs ﬁeld, H, at constant
T = 300 K was measured in the range from −5.6 MA/m
to +5.6 MA/m.

B. Computational details

Fully relativistic electronic band structure calculations
were carried out by using the Full-Potential Local-Orbital
Minimum-Basis Scheme (FPLO-14)29 within the gener-
alized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-
correlation potential in the Perdew, Burke, Ernzerhof
form (PBE)30. Calculations were performed with 16 ×
16 × 16 k-mesh and convergence criterion 10−8 Ha. An
initial spin splitting is applied to the 3d-atoms, assuming
ferromagnetic structures, as observed experimentally.

For Fe5SiB2, Co5SiB2, Fe5PB2, and Fe5SB2 the lat-
tice parameters and the internal atomic positions were
optimized, see Table I. The optimized structural param-
eters of Fe5SiB2 and Fe5PB2 are in an excellent agree-
ment with the corresponding experimental values16,22.
We note that the computationally relaxed structural pa-
rameters reported here are for the stoichiometric phases
of Fe5SiB2 and Fe5PB2, while the previously measured
values are estimated from non-fully stoichiometric sam-
ples.

Virtual crystal approximation (VCA) is used to study
three ranges of compositions, the ﬁrst one between
Fe5SiB2 and Co5SiB2, the second one between Fe5SiB2
and Fe5PB2, and the last one between Fe5PB2 and
Fe5SB2. The general idea of the VCA is to imitate a
homogeneous random on-site occupation of two types of
atoms by using a virtual atom with a corresponding aver-
aged value of the nuclear charge and number of electrons.
Application of VCA for Fe/Co alloying is motivated by
the fact that Co atomic number is one above Fe and fur-

3

thermore that similar VCA calculations have already pro-
duced valuable results for other Fe/Co alloys3,5,11. Since
P and Si are also neighbors in the periodic table, and as
the p-elements are basically supplying itinerant electrons
to the crystal, the VCA is expected to be a good approxi-
mation of the substitutional disorder also for this class of
systems. The same argument holds for P/S alloying. It
is important to comment that although VCA is expected
to give the right qualitative trends of MAE changes with
Fe/Co concentration, the exact values of MAE are usu-
ally overestimated by a factor between 2 and 4 in compar-
ison to experiment. More accurate results of MAE can
be calculated within the coherent potential approxima-
tion (CPA)11,31–33. Unfortunately, the utilized version of
the FPLO code, which allows to perform the spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) calculations together with ﬁxed spin mo-
ment (FSM), does not allow to combine SOC with CPA.
Calculations for Fe5Si1−xPxB2 compositions start from
the Fe5SiB2 structure with a full Si site occupation. The
Si atom is then replaced by a virtual atom to mimic
the speciﬁc composition. The atomic number of virtual
atom is ZVCA = (1 − x) · ZSi + x · ZP. The lattice param-
eters of the intermediate compositions are interpolated
linearly between the lattice parameters of the extreme
systems, aVCA = (1 − x) · aFe5SiB2 + x · aFe5PB2 . For ev-
ery composition the internal atomic positions are opti-
mized. The VCA calculations for (Fe1−xCox)5SiB2 se-
ries are performed with lattice parameters and internal
atomic positions interpolated as the linear combinations
of crystal parameters of boundary compositions Fe5SiB2
and Co5SiB2.

VESTA code34 was used for visualization of crystal

structures.

Table II presents the atomic coordinates of Fe5SiB2
structure derived from crystal structure reﬁnement of
XRD data. Determined lattice parameters are a =

5.5561(3) ˚A and c = 10.3476(10) ˚A, estimated standard
deviations are in the parenthesis. Previously reported
Fe5SiB2 lattice parameters obtained by Ericsson22 are
a = 5.43 ˚A and c = 10.33 ˚A, in close agreement with our
results. The Fe5PB2 lattice parameters are a = 5.482 ˚A
and c = 10.332 ˚A16.
It indicates that there are only
few promiles diﬀerences between the calculated and mea-
sured lattice parameters for Fe5SiB2 and Fe5PB2, com-
pare with Table I.

tively, while the blue line shows the diﬀerence between ob-
served and calculated data. Bars show the theoretical Bragg
peaks of the Fe5SiB2 phase (upper) and the impurity phase,
Fe3Si (lower).

Using the M vs H measurement at T = 300 K, the
result for Fe5SiB2 is K1 = 0.25 MJ/m3. Since Eq. 1 con-
tains only the 1/H 2 dependence of M (H), the selection
of ﬁeld interval for the K1 estimation is crucial. Here,
the ﬁeld interval 0.6–1.0 MA/m was used, corresponding
to M (H)/Msat = 0.95–0.98. However, the need of a more
accurate method, e.g. involving a single crystal sample, is
emphasized and will be the aim for further experiments.
Concerning the proposed reorientation of spins at T =
140 K reported from M¨ossbauer experiments, the follow-
ing observation was made from magnetization measure-
ments, see Fig. 3: The M vs T curve shows a broad
peak around T = 160 K and then M decreases continu-
ously with decreasing temperature to an approximately
constant level at T = 10 K. The decrease in M from
T = 160 K to T = 10 K is 30%.

IV. DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY

The value of Msat (M at H = 5.6 MA/m) at T = 300 K
is 0.92 MA/m (6.3µB/f.u.) which is considerably smaller
than expected from M¨ossbauer measurements, 1.2 MA/m
(8.2µB/f.u.). However, the M¨ossbauer data was reported
for T = 80 K. Further, due to surface eﬀects, Msat for
small particles should be lower than the bulk value. Also,
there are non-magnetic impurities in the sample, e.g.
Fe3Si, decreasing the value of Msat. Assuming the sam-
ple to consist of crystallites with uniaxial anisotropy, the
anisotropy constant, K1, was estimated using the 1/H 2-
term in the law of approach to saturation. This term
is assumed to originate from the magnetization rotating
against the magnetocrystalline anisotropy:

CALCULATIONS

A. Fe5SiB2 Electronic Structure

[Ar] 4s23d6, Si:

The basic electronic conﬁgurations of the elements
[Ne] 3s23p2
forming Fe5SiB2 are Fe:
and B: [He] 2s22p1. This is also reﬂected in the densities
of electronic states (DOS), see Fig. 4. The total DOS is
a sum of the individual atomic contributions, from which
the dominant role is played by Fe 3d bands. Fe 3d, Si 3s,
Si 3p, B 2s, and B 2p bands are presented on the spin
projected DOS plots. The Fe bands Fe1 3d and Fe2 3d,
for two inequivalent Fe sites, are both strongly spin po-
larized. The corresponding spin magnetic moments are
1.87 and 2.24µB/atom, respectively. The spin, orbital
and total magnetic moments are summarized in Table III.
The Si and B spin magnetic moments are both equal to
−0.25µB.

From −2.5 eV up to the Fermi level the character of
DOS originates almost entirely from Fe1 3d and Fe2 3d

B. MAE of Fe5Si1−xPxB2 and Fe5P1−xSxB2

The M¨ossbauer study revealed the ”in-plane” spin ori-
entation for Fe5SiB2 below 140 K22, in contrast to the
“easy-axis” spin orientation for Fe5PB2 down to 80 K.
As we are interested in materials with high magne-
tocrystalline anisotropy, we extend theoretical inquires
of Fe5SiB2 by the promising uniaxial case of Fe5PB2. In
this paper MAE is determined as the diﬀerence between
total energies obtained for orthogonal spin quantization
axes, MAE = E100 − E001. Positive MAE value there-
fore denotes the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy
along with easy axis along the [001] direction (tetrago-
nal axis), whereas for negative MAE there is an easy-
plane magnetization (ab-plane). Calculated MAE of
Fe5SiB2 and Fe5PB2 are −0.28 and 0.35 MJ/m3 (−140
and 170 µeV/f.u.), respectively. The negative and pos-
itive signs agree well with the experimentally observed
magnetic structures22. For magnetic moment, going from
Fe5SiB2 to Fe5PB2, the most noticeable change is that of
the induced spin magnetic moment on 3p-element, from
−0.25 to −0.14µB (see Table III). The calculated total
magnetic moments on Fe1 and Fe2 sites of Fe5PB2 are
1.86 and 2.27µB/atom, respectively. They diﬀer from
experimental values 1.6µB for Fe1 and 2.2µB for Fe2, de-
rived from the magnetic hyperﬁne ﬁelds23, however the
mentioned experimental values are only indirect approx-
imate estimations.

bands. It means that the main contribution to the DOS
at the Fermi level is provided by the Fe 3d states, what
moreover leads to high spin polarization on the Fermi
level, of about 66 %. Furthermore, calculations show that
the orbital magnetic moments are present only on the Fe
atoms (see Table III). Their values 0.039µB and 0.048µB
are close to the value 0.043µB for bcc iron, calculated
within the same frame. Furthermore, the all theoreti-
cal values are reduced in comparison to the experimental
value 0.086µB for the bcc iron35. The total magnetic
moment per formula unit is equal to 9.20µB, which is
in good agreement with the recently determined exper-
imental value 9.35µB/f.u. (5 ∗ 1.87µB/Fe) from M (H)
measurements at 10 K36.

FIG. 5. The concentration dependency of the MAE for a)
Fe5Si1−xPxB2 and b) Fe5P1−xSxB2.

A priori it is not obvious, what will be the evolution
of MAE as a function of concentration x. As an exam-
ple of non-monotonic behavior we note the Fe/Co1 or
(Fe/Co)2B alloys9. Therefore we have performed VCA
studies of the Fe5Si1−xPxB2 for the whole range of com-
positions, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. The resulting VCA calculations of
MAE vs x are presented in Fig. 5a). The x-dependence
of MAE is monotonic except for the smallest values of P
concentration. The MAE values for both stoichiometric

concentrations are near extremal. With an increase of the
P concentration the system is heading towards the uniax-
ial anisotropy, with a cross-over at x >
∼ 0.7. The transition
from Si 3p2 to P 3p3 can be understood as an increase in
the number of electrons in Fe5Si1−xPxB2 system. Fur-
ther increase in the number of electrons can be realized
by transition from P 3p3 to S 3p4. As shown in Fig. 5b)
for the hypothetical alloys with sulfur Fe5P1−xSxB2 sig-
niﬁcant values of MAE ∼0.7 MJ/m3 are obtained for a
broad range of sulfur concentration 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 1.

In order to get deeper insight into the origin of MAE,
the energy scale of the band structure has to be changed
from tens of eV into tenths of eV, since the SOC con-
stant of 3d-metals is in the order of 0.05 eV, which is also
why the spin-orbit splitting does not exceed this value,
see Fig. 6. Fully relativistic calculations result in an ad-
ditional splitting of the electronic bands, due to spin-
orbit coupling. The ﬁgure presents the Fe5SiB2 bands in
the vicinity of the Fermi level, together with the MAE
contributions per k-point as obtained by the magnetic
force theorem37,38. Spin-orbit splitting results in diﬀer-
ent band structures for quantization axes 100 and 001
indicated by red and blue lines.

The calculated total MAE of Fe5SiB2 is −140 µeV/f.u.
(−0.28 MJ/m3). The MAE value ∼ 10−4 eV/f.u.
indi-
cates a ﬁne compensation of the much bigger negative
and positive contributions to MAE of about 10−3 eV per
k-point. Moreover, it is easy to notice the step changes
of MAE(k) whenever the band crosses the Fermi level.
Thus, when so many bands cross it, a very accurate
model of the electronic band structure and ﬁne k-mesh
are crucial to calculate MAE.

C. Fe5SiB2 Fixed Spin Moment and Volume

Dependencies

For Fe5SiB2 the M¨ossbauer study revealed the ”in-
plane” spin orientation below 140 K and spins parallel to
c-axis above 140 K22. A similar transition from negative
to positive magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant was
observed for Fe2B with a transition temperature about
520 K9. Since the goal of this study is to explore for
potential candidates for permanent magnets, the experi-
mentally revealed increase of MAE with temperature for
Fe5SiB2 has motivated theoretical studies which should
allow for better understanding of this phenomena. To
answer the question, whether the increase of MAE with
T is related to the volume expansion, we have calcu-
lated volume-dependency of MAE. Experimentally ob-
served increase of volume between 16 and 165 K is only
about 0.01%, but for this small volume expansion no sig-
niﬁcant change of MAE is observed, see Fig 7. The per-
formed calculations cover a much bigger range of volume
change, namely from −10% to +10% and, what is strik-
ing, for a very large volume reduction the negative MAE
change its sign, and for V /V0 = 0.9 reaches signiﬁcant
value 0.52 MJ/m3. By a rough estimation, such volume

6

reduction would correspond to about 20 GPa pressure,
readily available in high pressure experiments39.

Fig. 8 shows non-linear volume dependency of the to-
tal magnetic moment for Fe5SiB2. From ﬁgures 7 and
8 one could contemplate that MAE might increase when
magnetic moment decreases. To address the question,
whether the MAE changes in the same manner with
only magnetic moment variation and without change
of volume, a set of fully relativistic ﬁxed spin moment
(FSM) calculations was performed. Fig. 9 presents the
total magnetic moment (MS + ML) dependency of MAE.
MS + ML is evaluated for every ﬁxed spin magnetic mo-
ment MS.

FSM calculations show for Fe5SiB2 that MAE starts
to increase with the decrease of total magnetic moment,
and reaches the maximal value of MAE = 1.78 MJ/m3
for MS + ML = 6.15µB/f.u., while equilibrium MS +
ML = 9.20µB/f.u. We suggest that signiﬁcant increase
of MAE might occur if we would ﬁnd a way to reduce
the magnetic moment of Fe5SiB2 by 1/3. A possible
venue to achieve this could be alloying of magnetic ele-
ment Fe with an element carrying a lower magnetic mo-
ment, Co. Following this idea the VCA calculations of
(Fe1−xCox)5SiB2 are carried out, expecting that alloying
with Co will reduce magnetic moment, and hopefully in
consequence increase the MAE. It is important to com-
ment that reducing the magnetic moment by FSM or
by alloying with another element will necessarily result
in diﬀerent changes to electronic structure, therefore we
can’t expect this analogy to hold, at least not up to large
moment reduction. Nevertheless it is of interest to ﬁnd
out to what extent is this parallel realistic. Moreover,
alloying of iron-based magnetic materials with Co has
already been shown to lead to an increased MAE in sev-
eral cases1,3,4,11.

of

VCA calculations

of
(Fe1−xCox)5SiB2 concentrations start from optimizing
the extreme structures of Fe5SiB2 and Co5SiB2 (see
Sect. II and Table I) and interpolating crystallographic
parameters for intermediate compositions. The spin
magnetic moments on Co1 and Co2 atoms in Co5SiB2
are 0.41 and 0.90µB, respectively. They induce the small
opposite spin moments on Si and B, equal to −0.05 and
−0.06µB, respectively. The total magnetic moment per
Co5SiB2 formula unit is equal to 2.42µB (see Table III).
We expect that Fe/Co alloying will reduce the mag-
netic moment, and thus may increase MAE of Fe5SiB2.
The results of MAE(x) presented in Fig. 10 con-
ﬁrms our predictions partially.
The maximum of
MAE = 1.16 MJ/m3 is obtained for x = 0.3 together with
MS + ML reduced from 9.20 to 7.75µB/f.u., and not for
6.15µB/f.u., as predicted for Fe5SiB2 from VCA. Fig. 11
shows explicitly the dependence of MAE on MS + ML for
(Fe1−xCox)5SiB2.

Our studies of MAE(MS + ML) are then summarized
in Fig. 12, where the total magnetic moment MS + ML
was varied by changing volume, ﬁxed spin moment
(FSM) or Fe/Co concentration. The MAE(MS + ML)
variations induced by FSM or volume scaling are very
similar. The behavior of MAE(MS + ML) related to
alloying Fe5SiB2 with Co exhibit signiﬁcant diﬀerences

ment FSM and doping with Co. Together with electronic
bands the MAE contributions of each k-point are pre-
sented as obtained by the magnetic force theorem37,38.
The direction between high symmetry points X and P
has been chosen because of the exceptionally simple form
of bands in comparison to the other directions in Fig. 6.
For X-P direction it is easy to notice how the band is
ﬁlled with an increase of Co concentration x (panels d),
e), f), and g)) or a corresponding behavior induced by
reduction of spin moment (panels d), c), b), and a)).
The ﬁlling of the bands entails the change in MAE. In
the energy window from −0.5 to 0.5 eV the diﬀerences
in spin-orbit splitting for two quantization axes 100 and
001 might be diﬃcult to notice. Nonetheless, the band
structures calculated for two perpendicular quantization
axes are marked in red and blue, respectively. Diﬀerences
in spin-orbit splitting can be observed on several bands
crossings. For Co concentration x = 0 (Fig. 13 d)) it is
particularly easy to notice that the extra positive contri-

8

bution to MAE is related to the band crossing Fermi
level. For this band the 001 solution (blue line) lies
slightly below the corresponding 100 band (red line), thus
for the whole ﬁlled region, up to Fermi level, the positive
contributions to MAE is observed.

The substantial diﬀerences in MAE(MS+ML) medi-
ated by FSM or Co alloying raises the question whether
this two mechanism work together. In Fig. 14 the FSM
and VCA dependencies of MAE are presented in a form of
two-dimensional color map in superposition with the the-
oretical equilibrium total magnetic moments (MS+ML).
The MAE landscape reveals that by going from equi-
librium magnetic moment of pure Fe5SiB2 towards the
much lower equilibrium magnetic moment of Co5SiB2 the
equilibrium MAE path (black dots) starts from negative
sign, goes across the range of positive values and follows
through a steep hollow of negative values. This equi-
librium path crossing the MAE landscape correspond to
the MAE(x) function presented in Fig. 10. Focusing on
the uniaxial anisotropy, the highest MAE value along the
equilibrium path is reached for the (Fe0.7Co0.3)5SiB2 al-
loy and is equal to 1.16 MJ/m3. We note that on the
calculated MAE landscape, there is a region with about
twice higher values of MAE for x = 0.1 and MS+ML
about 5.8µB/f.u. To approach this region, starting, e.g.,
from the (Fe0.7Co0.3)5SiB2 composition, both the mag-
netic moment and the d-electrons number (proportional
to x) should be reduced. The desired magnetic moment
reduction, from 7.75 to around 5.8µB/f.u.,
is around
25%. This can be obtained by alloying (Fe0.7Co0.3)5SiB2
with 25% of a suitable non-magnetic element. The non-
magnetic alloying should at the same time decreases x
(which may be understood as the number of d electrons
beyond those of Fe) by about 0.2. Such decrease can be
obtained by alloying (Fe0.7Co0.3) with elements having
less of d electrons, i.e., the elements from columns of the
periodic table preceding the column with Fe. Among 3d-
elements which fulﬁll the latter condition are Cr or Mn,
but these often carry rather large magnetic moments,
therefore they would not fulﬁll the ﬁrst condition – re-
duction of average moment per atom. From 4d- and 5d-
elements possible candidates are Mo and Tc, or W and
Re, respectively.

Similar analysis of MAE landscape as presented above
has been previously performed for (FeCo)2B11 and led
to very similar results. The additional calculations for
(FeCo)2B with W and Re conﬁrmed that these doped
systems should exhibit signiﬁcant increase of MAE. Sub-
sequently conducted synthesis succeeded in producing
(Fe0.675Co0.3Re0.025)2B sample for which the theoreti-
cally predicted increase of MAE has been observed11.
Thus we propose that also for (Fe0.7Co0.3)5SiB2, alloying
it with with W and Re might help to improve MAE. This
is, however, outside the scope of the present manuscript
and is left for future investigations.

The VCA yields similar results of MAE as a func-
tion of x in (Fe1−xCox)5SiB2 when comparing with
(Fe1−xCox)2B11. Nevertheless, the VCA may quanti-

tatively overestimate the MAE11,32,33. Hence, calcula-
tions have also been attempted using the SPRKKR40,41
method in the atomic sphere approximation (ASA) with
the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to treat the
alloying. However, it turns out that the SPRKKR-ASA
calculations yield magnetic moments in poor agreement
with the full potential calculations performed with the
FPLO, as illustrated in Table IV. We suspect that the
primary reason for this discrepancy is the lack of full-
potential eﬀects, since our SPRKKR calculations were
done with the same exchange-correlation functional30
and the ASA might not give an accurate description of
magnetic properties in non-close packed systems11. To
conﬁrm this suspicion, full potential calculations were
also performed for Fe5SiB2 in SPRKKR and as seen in
Table IV, the agreement with the FPLO is much better.
The failure of the ASA is likely to be related to the empty
spaces observed in the structure of this system15, since
it should expected to be a good approximation for close
packed structures. The magnetocrystalline anisotropies
calculated with the CPA in SPRKKR-ASA (not shown)
qualitatively disagree with the FPLO VCA results but
as the MAE is a delicate magnetic property depending
sensitively on the electronic structure, we do not con-
sider MAE values obtained in SPRKKR-ASA to be reli-
able when the magnetic moments are not accurately de-
scribed. Full potential MAE calculations using CPA are
more challenging and beyond the scope of the current
work. We point out that VCA prediction agrees with the

recent experimental results24 of MAE increase for alloy-

served for (Fe0.8Co0.2)5SiB2 (Fe4CoSiB2) the increase of
anisotropy ﬁeld accompanied by 20% reduction of mag-
netic moment, in comparison to the pure Fe5SiB2. Their
measurements done on Fe5SiB2 are also in good agree-
ment with our experimental results. For Fe5PB2 Lamich-
hane et al.25 report experimental values of MAE = 0.5
MJ/m3, and total magnetic moment equal to 8.6µB/f.u.
McGuire and Parker24 calculated in plane anisotropy
with K1 equal to -0.42 (-0.28) MJ/m3 with total magnetic
moment 9.15 (9.20) µB/f.u.
for Fe5SiB2, and uniaxial
anisotropy with K1 equal to 0.46 (0.35) MJ/m3 with to-
tal magnetic moment 8.95 (9.15) µB/f.u. for Fe5PB2, for
comparison the results of our calculations in parenthesis.
The diﬀerences between MAE calculated by us and by
McGuire and Parker most likely come from the fact that
we have used the optimized lattice parameters instead of
the experimental ones. The fact that we employed the
FPLO and McGuire and Parker used the WIEN2k should
not lead to substantial diﬀerences11.

FIG. 14. MAE as a function of x and total magnetic moment
(MS+ML) for (Fe1−xCox)5SiB2. Disorder was treated by the
VCA. MS+ML was stabilized with ﬁxed spin moment (FSM)
approach. Equilibrium MS+ML are denoted by the black
dots.

We have presented an experimental study of struc-
tural and magnetic properties of Fe5SiB2 polycrystalline
materials. This study was computationally extended
across the whole range of Fe5Si1−xPxB2, Fe5P1−xSxB2,
and (Fe1−xCox)5SiB2 alloys, with an eﬀort to evaluate
the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies. Theoreti-
cal study of volume variation and fully relativistic ﬁxed
spin moment calculations of stoichiometric Fe5SiB2 ev-
idences a strong inverse dependency between MAE and
total magnetic moment, leading to a maximal value of
MAE = 1.78 MJ/m3 for MS + ML = 6.15µB/f.u., while
equilibrium magnetic moment is 9.20µB/f.u. Alloying of
Fe5SiB2 with Co is suggested to reproduce reduction of
magnetic moment. The whole range of (Fe1−xCox)5SiB2
concentrations is calculated and evidence of a MAE max-
imum is obtained for Co concentration x = 0.3, with
the value of MAE = 1.16 MJ/m3 and with the mag-
netic moment 7.75µB/f.u. Thus, (Fe0.7Co0.3)5SiB2 ap-
pears to be a promising candidate for a rare-earth free
permanent magnet. Also further increase of MAE of
(Fe0.7Co0.3)5SiB2 is expected by doping with some of 4d-
or 5d-elements. For Fe5Si1−xPxB2 a monotonic trend in
MAE has been obtained, suggesting that at low tem-
peratures and below x ≈ 0.8 the alloys should have in-
plane magnetization, while above x ≈ 0.8 the magnetiza-
tion should point along the c-axis. The overall MAE val-
ues are rather low, suggesting that Fe5Si1−xPxB2 class
of materials can only form soft magnets. On the other
hand the hypothetical Fe5P1−xSxB2 compositions with
sulfur exhibit increased MAE with the highest value of
0.77 MJ/m3 for Fe5P0.4S0.6B2 and MAE = 0.67 MJ/m3
for Fe5SB2.
