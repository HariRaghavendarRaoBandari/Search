ABSTRACT
We present linear polarization observations of the exoplanet system HD 189733 made
with the HIgh Precision Polarimetric Instrument (HIPPI) on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope (AAT). The observations have higher precision than any previously reported
for this object. They do not show the large amplitude polarization variations reported
by Berdyugina et al. (2008, 2011). Our results are consistent with polarization data
presented by Wiktorowicz et al. (2015). A formal least squares ﬁt of a Rayleigh-
Lambert model yields a polarization amplitude of 29.4 ± 15.6 parts-per-million. We
observe a background constant level of polarization of ∼ 55–70 ppm, which is a little
higher than expected for interstellar polarization at the distance of HD 189733.

1 INTRODUCTION

The characterisation of exoplanet atmospheres, particularly
with ground based telescopes, is a diﬃcult task. Polarimetry
oﬀers a useful approach, providing a strong contrast between
the star and planet as the star’s light is typically unpolar-
ized (Seager, Whitney & Sasselov 2000). Large and tightly
orbiting hot Jupiter planets scatter enough light to poten-
tially produce a polarisation signal dependent largely upon
the composition of the atmosphere (Hough et al. 2003). The
detection of linearly polarized light from an exoplanet sys-
tem can provide information about a planet’s orbital orien-
tation and about the properties of the particles that scatter
the light in its atmosphere. The technique therefore provides
complementary information to other characterisation tech-
niques such as transit and eclipse spectroscopy.

Seager, Whitney & Sasselov (2000) modelled the ex-
pected polarization levels for hot Jupiter-type systems and
predicted that linear polarization varying over the orbital
cycle at the tens of parts-per-million level might be present
in the combined light of the star and planet. Since Sun-
like stars are thought to generally have low polarizations
(Bailey, Lucas & Hough 2010; Cotton et al. 2016) this tech-
nique provides good contrast and should be achievable from
ground-based observations. Past attempts at polarized light
detection such as those described in Lucas et al. (2009) have
not detected signiﬁcant planetary polarization signals.

c(cid:13) 2016 The Authors

The HD 189733 hot Jupiter system (Bouchy et al. 2005;
Torres et al. 2008) is one of the brightest and best studied
transiting exoplanet systems. Observations of transits and
eclipses of HD 189733b using the Hubble Space Telescope
have shown strong evidence for a Rayleigh scattering haze
in its atmosphere, which shows up as increasing absorption
towards shorter wavelengths in the transit spectrum (Pont
et al. 2008, 2013) as well as reﬂected light seen in the sec-
ondary eclipse at blue wavelengths (Evans et al. 2013). This
makes HD 189733b a promising target for polarimetric ob-
servations.

However, polarization observations of this system to
date have produced conﬂicting results. Berdyugina et al.
(2008) reported an unexpectedly high level of polariza-
tion variation of ∼200 ppm (parts-per-million) from the
HD 189733 exoplanet system using the DIPol instrument
(Piirola et al. 2005) at La Palma’s KVA (Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences) telescope. Subsequently Wiktorowicz
(2009) reported no polarization variation with an upper limit
of 79 ppm (99 per cent conﬁdence) using the POLISH instru-
ment. Further observations (Berdyugina et al. 2011) using
TurPol (Piirola 1973) on the Nordic Optical Telescope in
three bands showed a polarization signal in the U and B
bands but not in the V band. They argued that the non-
detection by Wiktorowicz (2009) was due to the use of too
red a band. The amplitude reported in the B band was 100
± 10 ppm. The polarization was attributed to Rayleigh scat-
tering from the planet’s atmosphere.

More recently Wiktorowicz et al. (2015) have reported
B band polarization measurements of HD 189733 using the

2 K. Bott et al.

POLISH2 instrument on the Lick Observatory 3-m tele-
scope. They set a limit on the B band polarization amplitude
of 60 ppm (99.7 per cent conﬁdence).

This paper presents the most sensitive measurements
of the system to date using a blue broadband ﬁlter in an
attempt to distinguish between these conﬂicting results.

2 OBSERVATIONS

HD 189733 was observed during three observing runs on the
3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) at Siding Spring
Observatory, New South Wales, Australia. The observations
were made with the HIgh Precision Polarimetric Instrument
(HIPPI)(Bailey et al. 2015). The dates of observations were
2014 Aug 28-31, 2015 May 23, 26 and Jun 26. HIPPI is
an aperture polarimeter using a ferroelectric liquid crystal
(FLC) modulator, a Wollaston prism analyser and two pho-
tomultiplier tubes (PMT) as detectors. The FLC provides a
500 Hz primary modulation which is used together with two
additional stages of slower modulation obtained by rotation
of the Wollaston prism and detectors, and ﬁnally by rotating
the whole instrument to four position angles (0, 45, 90, 135
degress) using the AAT’s Cassegrain rotator.
HIPPI has been shown from repeat observations of
bright low polarization stars to deliver a precision of 4.3 ×
10−6 (4.3 parts-per-million or ppm) or better (Bailey et al.
2015). This is comparable to or better than the precisions re-
ported from polarimeters based on photoelastic modulators
such as the Pine Mountain Observatory polarimeter (Kemp
& Barbour 1981) , PlanetPOL (Hough et al. 2006), POLISH
(Wiktorowicz & Matthews 2008) and POLISH2 (Wiktorow-
icz & Noﬁ 2015; Wiktorowicz et al. 2015).

HIPPI uses Hamamatsu H10720-210 PMT modules
that have ultra-bialkali photocathodes with a peak quan-
tum eﬃciency of 43 per cent at 400 nm. The HD 189733
observations were made through a 500 nm short pass ﬁl-
ter (referred to as 500SP) to exclude any red light from
the K 1.5 V star. The overall bandpass covers 350 to 500
nm (the polarization optics cut oﬀ light below 350 nm) and
the eﬀective wavelength calculated from the bandpass model
described by Bailey et al. (2015) is 446.1 nm. This is a sim-
ilar but somewhat broader band than the B band used by
Berdyugina et al. (2011) and Wiktorowicz et al. (2015).
The moonlit sky can contribute a signiﬁcant polarized
background signal within our 6.7 (cid:48)(cid:48)diameter aperture. The
2014 August observations were all made with lunar illumi-
nation phases less than 35 per cent but with the Moon near
90◦ seperation from HD 189733b where Rayleigh scatter-
ing is at a maximum. The 2015 observations were all made
after the Moon had set. Any residual background signal is
subtracted from the data using a sky observation made im-
mediately after each science observation at each Cassegrain
rotator position.

The telescope introduces a small polarization (telescope
polarization or TP) that must be corrected for. As described
in Bailey et al. (2015) we determine the TP using observa-
tions of a number of stars we believe to have very low po-
larization either based on previous PlanetPol observations
(Hough et al. 2006; Bailey, Lucas & Hough 2010) or because
of their small distances and expected low levels of interstel-
lar polarization (see Bailey, Lucas & Hough 2010; Cotton
et al. 2016). The telescope polarization has been found to be

scope polarization (TP) in the 500SP ﬁlter. The adopted TP for
the August 2014 and May 2015 runs use only measurements ac-
quired on that run. The June 2015 run uses measurements from
both May and June 2015.

stable during each run, and between the 2015 May and June
runs, but changed signﬁcantly from 2014 to 2015, probably
as a result of the realuminization of the AAT primary mir-
ror in early 2015. Determinations of TP in the SDSS g(cid:48) ﬁlter
are reported in Bailey et al. (2015) and Cotton et al. (2016)
giving values of 48 ± 5 ppm in 2014, and 36 ± 1 ppm in
2015.

We have also made a smaller number of TP observations
directly in the 500SP ﬁlter used with HD 189733 as listed
in Table 1. These observations consistently show telescope
polarizations of 22 to 25 per cent higher values than the
more extensive g(cid:48) band observations.

Full details of the observation, calibration, and data re-
duction procedures with HIPPI can be found in Bailey et al.
(2015).

3 RESULTS

The unbinned polarization results before eﬃciency correc-
tion on HD 189733, corrected for telescope polarization using
the values in Table 1, are listed in Table 2. Each of these mea-
surements is the result of approximately one hour of total
observation (half this for the last two points on 2014:08:31).
We list the mid-point time and the normalised Stokes pa-
rameters Q/I and U/I are given in parts-per-million (ppm)
on the equatorial system. One further correction is required
to the data and this is for the wavelegth dependent modula-
tion eﬃciency of the instrument. This is calculated using the
bandpass model described by Bailey et al. (2015) speciﬁcally
for each observation. The value is close to 82.4 per cent for
all of these observations.

The nightly means of the corrected observations each
consisting of approximately two to three hours total ob-
serving time are given in Table 3. One point (2014:08:31
12:47:49) has been omitted from the binned data as it is be-
lieved to be aﬀected by variable sky background due to the
Moon setting mid observation.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Comparison with previous results

Our results diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those reported by
Berdyugina et al. (2011). While we see consistently posi-
tive values of Q/I and U/I, Berdyugina et al. (2011) show
near zero values at phases 0.0 and 0.5, with a strong negative
excursion around phases 0.3 and 0.7, reaching an amplitude
of nearly 100 ppm in Q/I. Even if we allow an arbitrary zero
point shift, our data are not consistent with such a large
amplitude variation in Q/I.

Our data are in much better agreement with the results
of Wiktorowicz et al. (2015). This dataset shows generally
positive Q/I and U/I with average values (from data in their
Table 3) of Q/I = 19.2 ± 4.1 ppm and U/I = 40.3 ± 3.5 ppm,
which are in reasonable agreement with our averages of Q/I
= 42.7 ± 5.4 and U/I = 35.4 ± 5.5 ppm. The diﬀerences can
probably be understood as due to uncertainties in the tele-
scope polarization of the Lick telescope which Wiktorowicz
et al. (2015) report is variable at the 10 ppm level.

4.2 Rayleigh-Lambert model

We have ﬁtted our data with a Rayleigh-Lambert model for
the expected polarization variation. This is a simple ana-
lytic model which calculates the intensity according to the

MNRAS 000, 1–5 (2016)

polarization of HD 189733

Figure 1. HIPPI measurements of the polarized light from the
HD 189733 system. The binned measurements from Table 3 are
shown. The red curve is a least sqares ﬁt of a Rayleigh-Lambert
model as described in Section 4.2. The blue lines show the best-ﬁt
curves for the data of Berdyugina et al. (2011)

expected phase variations for a Lambert sphere, and assumes
the polarization follows the phase function for Rayleigh scat-
tering (see: Seager, Whitney & Sasselov (2000) and Wik-
torowicz (2009)). To ﬁnd the best ﬁt we use a Levenberg-
Marquardt non-linear least squares algorithm (Press et al.
1992) with ﬁve parameters: the polarization zero point oﬀ-
sets in Q/I and U/I (Zq and Zu), the polarization amplitude
p which allows the eﬀects of depolarisation processes such as
multiple scattering to be taken into account, the position an-
gle of the major axis of the projected orbit ellipse on the sky
PA and the orbital inclination i. The ﬁtted parameters and
their uncertainties (determined from the covariance matrix
of the ﬁt) are listed in Table 4. The ﬁtted model is shown
by the red curve on Figure 1.

The less than 2-sigma uncertainty on the polarization
amplitude means that this cannot be considered as a de-
tection of polarized light from the planet. A model with no
polarization variation due to the planet is still an accepteble
ﬁt to the data. However, it is interesting that our best ﬁt
polarization amplitude of 29.4 ± 15.6 ppm is at a level that
is in agreement with plausible values for Rayleigh scattering
from the planet. For example Lucas et al. (2009) estimate an
amplitude of 26 ppm for a Rayleigh-like multiple scattering
model with a single scattering albedo of 0.99. This is an op-
timistic model because in reality we would expect a modest
reduction in the amplitude due to (i) atomic and molecu-
lar absorption features and (ii) the Rayleigh depolarisation
factor of 0.02 (Penndorf 1957; Hansen & Travis 1974) which
reduces the polarisation at each scattering event. Consider-
ing the geometric albedo from a fractional eclipse depth of
∼ 126 ppm from 290-450 nm reported in Evans et al. (2013),
and the Rayleigh scattering model grid of Buenzli & Schmid

(2009) which would place an upper limit to the amplitude
of the polarised light contribution at about 30 per cent of
the geometric albedo, we can estimate an upper bound for
a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere to be ∼ 37.8ppm.

A more extensive set of observations with an instrument
like HIPPI on a 4-m class telescope might be capable of de-
tecting the expected planetary signal in this and other bright
hot Jupiter systems. Putting a similar instrument on an 8-m
class telescope should enable the measurement uncertainties
to be halved from ∼ 14 ppm to ∼ 7 ppm, making detection
of the expected signals at levels of ∼ 20 ppm possible.

4.3 Constant polarization

A clear result of our observations, is that in addition to any
polarization from the planet, there is a constant background
level of polarization from HD 189733. Depending on what we
assume about the planetary signal, this ranges from around
55 ppm, if we use the values given in Section 4.1 for no
planetary signal, to 70 ppm for the best ﬁt model of Table
4. Interstellar polarization is the most likely source of po-
larization in typical solar-like stars (Bailey, Lucas & Hough
2010; Cotton et al. 2016).
Extrapolating from the trends in Figure 4 in Cotton et
al. (2016), we would expect a star at ∼ 19 pc (Koen et al.
2010), in the Northern Hemisphere and in the galactic plane
to have a polarization between 15–40 ppm. This is rather
less than the values we ﬁnd for HD 189733.

Circumstellar dust can also produce a constant oﬀset
for the polarized light signal from a system. However, Bry-
den et al. (2009) found HD 189733 was unlikely to have
circumstellar dust substantial enough to aﬀect polarisation
measurements based upon measurements of infrared excess.
The eﬀect of circumstellar dust on a system’s polarized light
measurements would be an addition to the oﬀsets Zq and Zu
which would not vary over the timescale of the planet’s orbit.

4.4 Eﬀect of starspots on system polarimetry

There are other possible sources that could be contribut-
ing to polarized light in the system. HD 189733A is an ac-
tive BY Draconis type variable star: a star whose brightness
varies due to star spots moving across its surface. Star spots
can cause linear polarization by breaking the circular sym-
metry of the limb polarization (Moutou et al. 2007). How-
ever Berdyugina et al. (2011) found that starspots would
only cause a maximum of 3 ppm contribution to polarized
light based on the photometric transit curve deviations from
Winn et al. (2007). Similarly, Kostogryz et al. (2015) esti-
mated the contribution of starspots on the polarized light
signal to be only ∼ 2 × 10−6. The interplay between the
planet and starspot symmetry breaking can produce de-
tectable eﬀects during the planet’s transit. However none
of our observations are taken during transit.

The linearly polarized light from the starspots them-
selves, is negligible (Afram & Berdyugina 2015) under most
circumstances. Magneto-optical eﬀects such as the trans-
verse Zeeman eﬀect (Huovelin & Saar 1991) or the Faraday
eﬀect (Calamai et al. 1975) could introduce noise to the lin-
ear polarisation measuements if enough lines were present
within our bandpass or if signiﬁcant starspot coverage is
present along with extended ionised gases from the planet’s
atmosphere respectively.

The rotational period of HD 189733A is known to be
longer, at 11.8 days (Moutou et al. 2007), than the or-
bital period of HD 189733b. With additional observations
it should be possible to determine whether the magnitude
of activity associated with starspots is signiﬁcant, and dis-
entangle it from that due to reﬂection from clouds in the
planetary atmosphere. Regardless, in any analysis focused
on the orbital period, starspot eﬀects will average out over
time.

4.5 Eﬀect of Saharan dust on La Palma

observations

The large polarization amplitudes for HD 189733 reported
by Berdyugina et al. (2011) are not seen in the other three
datasets now reported for this object, Wiktorowicz (2009),
Wiktorowicz et al. (2015) and this work.

The strongest evidence for polarization variation found
by Berdyugina et al. (2011) was in the B band TurPol data
from the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma obtained on
dates of 2008 Apr 18-24, and 2008 Aug 2-9. They note that
the August data was aﬀected by Saharan dust but argue that
this should not cause any eﬀect on the results as “TurPol

enables exact compensation of any background polarization
that is not variable ...”. This statement misunderstands how
airborne dust impacts on precision polarimetry. It is not
a background sky polarization that could be automatically
subtracted by the instrument’s sky-subtraction capability.
The dust introduces a spurious polarization into starlight
passing through the dust. The eﬀects were studied in detail
by Bailey et al. (2008) using observations of a Saharan dust
event observed with PlanetPol in 2005.

Data from the Carlsberg Meridian Telescope 1 on La
Palma show a substantial Saharan dust event over 2008 Aug
2 to 9 with the r(cid:48) band extinction ranging from 0.212 to 0.377
throughout this period (compared with a normal clear sky
level of ∼0.09). This is a larger and more extended event
than the one observed in 2005 by Bailey et al. (2008) which
led to spurious polarization eﬀects up to 48 ppm at 56◦
zenith distance. It seems highly likely that the HD 189733
data reported by Berdyugina et al. (2011) are signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by this dust. As the individual observations are not
reported, it is not possible to judge the extent of the prob-
lem. However, without exclusion or correction of aﬀected
data, this cannot be regarded as a reliable dataset for pre-
cision polarimetry.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have reported new polarization observations of the hot
Jupiter exoplanet system HD 189733. The observations have
higher precision than any previously reported for this object.
We do not detect the large polarization amplitude (100-200
ppm) planetary signals previously reported (Berdyugina et
al. 2008, 2011). Our results agree reasonably well with the
results of Wiktorowicz et al. (2015) showing generally posi-
tive polarization values in Q/I and U/I, and at most a small
planetary polarization signal.
A least-squares ﬁt of a Rayleigh-Lambert model gives a
polarization amplitude of 29.4 ± 15.6 ppm. While this signal
has less than 2-sigma signiﬁcance and cannot be claimed as a
detection of planetary polarization, it is at a level consistent
with a plausible polarization amplitude from the planet. It
is consistent with a multiply-scattering atmosphere which
could produce the albedo measurements taken by Evans et
al. (2013). This suggests that a more extensive series of ob-
servations, or observations on a larger telescope should en-
able the planetary polarization to be detected and measured.
HD 189733 has a signiﬁcant constant background level
of polarization that is a somewhat higher than would be ex-
pected for interstellar polarization. This could be due to the
non-unformity of the Local Hot Bubble interstellar medium.
We suggest that the polarization data of Berdyugina
et al. (2011), which shows a large polarization amplitude
inconsistent with that reported by other groups, may be un-
reliable as a result of spurious polarization due to a Saharan
dust event over the La Palma observatory in August 2008.
