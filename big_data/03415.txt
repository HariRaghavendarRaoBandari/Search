Local uniform rectiﬁability of uniformly distributed

measures

A. Dali Nimer

Abstract

The study of uniformly distributed measures was crucial in Preiss’ proof of his theorem
on rectiﬁability of measures with positive density. It is known that the support of a uniformly
distributed measure is an analytic variety. In this paper, we provide quantitative information on
the rectiﬁability of this variety. Tolsa had already shown that n-uniform measures are uniformly
rectiﬁable. Here, we prove that a uniformly distributed measure is locally uniformly rectiﬁable.

Introduction

Understanding the geometry of uniformly distributed measures has been an important question in
geometric measure theory ever since Preiss proved his remarkable theorem on the n-rectiﬁability
of measures in [P]. This theorem states that, given a Radon measure σ in Rd, if the n-density of σ

Θn(x, σ) = lim
r→0

σ(B(x, r))

rn

exists, is ﬁnite and positive σ-almost everywhere on Rd, then there exists a countably n-rectiﬁable
set E such that σ(Rd\E) = 0. The proof of Preiss’ theorem relied heavily on the study of uniformly
distributed measures.
Indeed, these measures appear as blow ups (zoom-ins) and blow downs
(zoom-outs) of measures with positive ﬁnite density. We say a Radon measure µ in Rd is uniformly
distributed if there exists a positive function φ : R+ → R+, called its distribution function, such
that:

µ(B(x, r)) = φ(r), for all x ∈ supp µ, for all r > 0.

An example of note is when the function φ is crn for some c > 0, n ≤ d. These are called n-uniform
measures and appear in many diﬀerent contexts from geometric measure theory to harmonic anal-
ysis and PDE’s (for instance in [KT], [DKT], [PTT]).

The geometry of the supports of uniformly distributed measures remains largely misunderstood.
Let us start by stating some known facts. As a direct consequence of Preiss’ theorem, we can deduce
that the support of an n-uniform measure is countably n-rectiﬁable. In fact, the same can be said of
uniformly distributed measures. Indeed, Preiss proved in [P] that uniformly distributed measures
“look like” n-uniform measures on small and on large scales. Their n-rectiﬁability can easily be
deduced from that fact.

One might expect much more regularity than rectiﬁability, given the fact that the property of
being uniformly distributed is a global one (i.e.
it is a property for all r > 0). This turns out
to be the case. For n-uniform measures, a classiﬁcation is available in some cases. In [P], Preiss
provides a classiﬁcation of the cases n = 1, 2 in Rd for any d .
In these cases, µ is Hausdorﬀ
measure restricted to a line or a plane respectively. In [KoP], Kowalski and Preiss proved that µ
is (d − 1)-uniform in Rd if and only if µ = Hd−1
V where V is a (d − 1)-plane, or d ≥ 4 and

1

there exists an orthonormal system of coordinates in which µ = Hd−1
(d − 4)-plane and C is the KP-cone (Kowalski-Preiss cone)

(C × W ) where W is a

C = {(x1, x2, x3, x4); x2

4 = x2

1 + x2

2 + x2

3}.

(1.1)

The classiﬁcation for n ≥ 3 and codimension ≥ 2 remains an open question.

On the other hand, in [KiP], Kirchheim and Preiss proved that the support of a uniformly
distributed measure is an analytic variety, that is the intersection of zero sets of analytic functions.
More precisely:

Theorem 1.1 ([KiP]). Let µ be a uniformly distributed measure over Rd and let u ∈ Σ where
Σ = suppµ. For every x ∈ Rd and s > 0 let

F (x, s) =ZRd

e−s|z−x|2

− e−s|z−u|2

dµ(z)

(1.2)

Then:

• F (x, s) is well-deﬁned and ﬁnite for any x ∈ Rd and any s > 0; moreover its deﬁnition is

independent of the choice of u ∈ Σ

• Σ =Ts>0(cid:8)x ∈ Rd; F (x, s) = 0(cid:9)

It is a known fact that an analytic variety of dimension n is a ﬁnite union of analytic n-
submanifolds up to a set of Hn-measure 0. This conﬁrms the expectation of regularity but has the
disadvantage of not providing any quantitative information on the regularity of the support.

Let us now turn to uniform rectiﬁability. This notion was introduced by David and Semmes
(see for example [DS2]). It is a quantitative version of the notion of n-rectiﬁability. One possible
deﬁnition of it is the following.

Let µ be a locally ﬁnite Radon measure in Rd, and Σ its support, 0 ∈ Σ. We say µ is uniformly
n-rectiﬁable if it is Ahlfors n-regular, and Σ has big pieces of Lipschitz images (BPLI) i.e. there
exist constants θ and M so that, for each x ∈ Σ and R > 0, there is a Lipschitz mapping g from
Rn to Rd such that g has Lipschitz norm not exceeding M and such that:

µ(B(x, R) ∩ g(Rn)) ≥ θRn.

In [T], Tolsa proved that n-uniform measures are uniformly rectiﬁable.

Theorem 1.2. [T] Let µ be an n-uniform measure in Rd. Then µ is uniformly n-rectiﬁable.

Since uniformly distributed measures “look like” n-uniform measures on small scales one might
expect this result to hold locally for uniformly distributed measures. In this paper, we will prove
that this is indeed the case. Namely, we will prove the following theorem:

Theorem 1.3. Let µ be a uniformly distributed measure in Rd. Then there exists n such that µ is
locally uniformly n-rectiﬁable.

The proof is analogous to Tolsa’s proof of Theorem 1.2. To apply the techniques that the author
introduced in [T], one needs to use the fact that uniformly distributed measures locally behave like
n-uniform measures and are radially invariant. These two properties allow us to obtain estimates
on the Riesz transforms and to prove that every ball in Σ the support of µ contains a relatively
large ball that is ﬂat.

The second step consists in proving that ﬂatness is stable for uniformly distributed measures.
In other words, if the support is ﬂat at small enough scale it will be ﬂat at all smaller scales. The
fact that uniformly rectiﬁable measures have n-uniform pseudo-tangents is the key idea allowing
us to generalize the stability of ﬂatness for n-uniform measures to uniformly distributed measures.

2 Preliminaries

Let us ﬁrst deﬁne the support of a measure.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let µ be a measure in Rd. We deﬁne the support of µ to be

supp(µ) =nx ∈ Rd; µ(B(x, r)) > 0, for all r > 0o .

Note that the support of a measure is a closed subset of Rd.

(2.1)

We start with some facts about uniformly distributed measures. The ﬁrst is a theorem by Preiss

describing the behavior of uniformly distributed measures at small and large scales.

Theorem 2.2 ([P], Theorem 3.11). Suppose µ is uniformly distributed in Rd, and let φ be its
distribution function. Then there exist integers n and p such that:

We denote n and p by

lim
r→0

φ(r)
rn and lim

r→∞

φ(r)
rp

both exist.

n = dim0µ and p = dim∞µ.

We can deduce the following useful corollary about the growth of µ at small scales from this

theorem.

Corollary 2.3. Suppose µ is a uniformly distributed measure with dim0µ = n and dim∞µ = p,
and φ the function associated to µ. Let R ∈ R+. There exists C ∈ R+ depending on R such that
for all r ≤ R, the following holds:

C −1rn ≤ φ(r) ≤ Crn.

(2.2)

Proof. According to Theorem 2.2 there exist r0 and r∞ such that:

µ(B(x, r)) ∼ rn, x ∈ Σ, r ≤ r0
µ(B(x, r)) ∼ rp, x ∈ Σ, r ≥ r∞

If R ≤ r0, the statement follows with a C not depending on R. First, assume r0 ≤ R ≤ r∞ and
take r such that r0 ≤ r ≤ R. Then:

n

r0
Rn rn . φ(r0) ≤ φ(r) ≤ φ(r∞) .

Now assume R ≥ r∞ and let r ≤ R. If r0 ≤ r ≤ r∞, then:

p

n rn

n

n rn ≤ r0

Finally, suppose r∞ ≤ r ≤ R. Then:

Another theorem in [KiP] states that uniformly distributed measures don’t grow too fast.

(2.4)

(2.5)

Theorem 2.4 ([KiP], Lemma 1.1). Let µ be a uniformly distributed measure over Rd, x ∈ Rd,

0 < s < r < ∞ and φ its distribution function. Then µ(B(x, r)) ≤ 5d(cid:0) r

s(cid:1)d φ(s).

Another interesting feature of uniformly distributed measures is that radial functions integrate

nicely against them.

Theorem 2.5. Let µ be a uniformly distributed measure on Rd and f be a non-negative Borel
function on R+. For all z, y ∈ supp(µ), we have:

Z f (|x − z|)dµ(x) =Z f (|x − y|)dµ(x).

Proof. This is a simple application of Fubini’s theorem.
I = (c, d) is an interval

Indeed, if f = αχI , where α ≥ 0 and

Z f (|x − z|)dµ(x) = αZ 1

0

µ({x; χI (|x − z|) ≥ t})dt,

= α (µ(B(z, d) ∩ B(z, d)c)) ,
= α (µ(B(y, d) ∩ B(y, c)c)) , since µ(B(z, r)) = µ(B(y, r)) for all r

=Z f (|x − y|)dµ(x).

The result follows for general non-negative Borel functions by linearity of the integral and density
of step functions.

Next, we introduce the following beta numbers initially introduced by P. Jones. They quantify

how ”ﬂat” (or far from a plane) the support of a measure is.

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let µ be a Radon measure in Rd, and Σ its support.

• We deﬁne Jones’ βn

µ number of B to be:

βn
µ (B) = inf
L

x∈Σ∩B

dist(x, L)

where B is a ball in Rd, and the inﬁmum is taken over all n-planes.

• We deﬁne the bilateral beta number bβn

µ of B to be:

bβn

µ (B) = inf

L   sup

x∈Σ∩B

dist(x, L)

r

+ sup
p∈L∩B

dist(p, Σ)

! ,

where the inﬁmum is taken over all n planes in Rd. We will drop the n superscript and µ
subscript when there is no ambiguity.

• We say µ is n-ﬂat if there exists an n-dimensional plane V in Rd such that µ = Hn

V .

Let us deﬁne a doubling measure.

Deﬁnition 2.7. Let µ be a measure in Rd. We say µ is a doubling measure if there exists C > 0
such that:

µ(B(x, 2r)) ≤ Cµ(B(x, r)), for all x ∈ supp(µ), for all r > 0.

(2.6)

The smallest such C is called the doubling constant of µ.

4

The two following lemmas relate the weak convergence of a sequence of doubling measures to

the convergence of their supports as sets in Rd.

Lemma 2.8. Let µj, µ be doubling Radon measures, all having their doubling constants bounded
by the same positive C > 0. Let Σj, Σ be the supports of µj and µ respectively, and B a closed ball
in Rd such that B ∩ Σ 6= ∅, and B ∩ Σj 6= ∅ for all j. If µj converges weakly to µ (µj ⇀ µ), then
dB,2B(Σj, Σ) converges to 0, where dB,2B(U, V ) = supx∈U ∩B dist(x, V ∩ 2B) + supx∈V ∩B dist(x, U ∩
2B) .

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that supp∈Σj∩B dist(p, Σ ∩ 2B) → 0. Suppose not. Then, without loss of
generality there exists ǫ > 0, pj ∈ Σj ∩ B, for j > 0, such that:

B(pj, 2ǫ) ∩ Σ ∩ 2B = ∅.

In particular, µ(B(pj, 2ǫ)) = 0. Let χj, ˜χ be functions compactly supported in 4B such that:
χB(pj ,ǫ) ≤ χj ≤ χB(pj ,2ǫ), and χB ≤ ˜χ ≤ χ3B. There exists kj ≥ 0 such that

In particular, since pj ∈ B

2B ⊂ B(pj, 2kj ǫ).

kj ≤

log(2r(B)) − log(ǫ)

log(2)

≤ K,

where K does not depend on j. Since µj are all doubling, we have:

C −Kµj(2B) ≤ µj(B(pj, ǫ)) ≤Z χjdµj.

contradiction.

On one hand, µj(2B) ≥R ˜χdµj andR ˜χdµj →R ˜χdµ > 0 imply that lim infR χjdµj > 0. On the
other hand, sinceR χjdµj ≤R ˜χd(µ − µj) + µ(B(pj, 2ǫ)), thenR χjdµj → 0 as j → ∞, yielding a

We now prove that supp∈Σ∩B dist(p, Σj ∩ 2B) → 0. Suppose not. Then there exists ǫ > 0, and,
without loss of generality, points xj ∈ Σ ∩ B such that: B(xj, 2ǫ) ∩ Σj ∩ 2B = ∅. In particular,
µj(B(xj, 2ǫ)) = 0. Passing to a subsequence, we can assume that xj → x, x ∈ Σ ∩ B since Σ ∩ B.
So there exists N such that, when j > N , |x − xj| < ǫ. Consequently, B(x, ǫ) ⊂ B(xj, 2ǫ) and
5 ) ≤ φ ≤ χB(x,ǫ).
µj(B(x, ǫ)) = 0. Let φ be a function compactly supported in 4B such that χB(x, ǫ

Then, on one hand, we have: R φdµj = 0, implying that R φdµ = limR φdµj = 0. On the other
hand,R φdµ ≥ µ(B(x, ǫ

Theorem 2.9. Let µj, µ be doubling measures, with the same doubling constant c, B a ball such
that: µj ⇀ µ, Σj ∩ B 6= ∅, Σ ∩ B 6= ∅. Let 0 < n ≤ d. Then:

plane L . Then: dist(x, L) ≤ dist(x, Σ ∩ 2B) + dist(y, L), implying that inf L supx∈Σj∩B dist(x, L) ≤
supx∈Σj∩B dist(x, Σ ∩ 2B) + inf L supy∈Σ∩2B dist(y, L). Therefore, βn

To describe the local geometry of a measure, we study objects called its tangents and pseudo-

tangents.

Deﬁnition 2.10. Let µ be a Radon measure on Rd.

• We say that ν is a tangent measure of µ at a point a ∈ Rd if ν is a non-zero Radon measure
on Rd, and if there exist sequences (ri) and (ci) of positive numbers such that ri → 0 and
ciTa,ri♯µ ⇀ ν, as i → ∞. Here, µi ⇀ ν is a notation for µi converges weakly to ν and Ta,ri♯µ
is the push-forward of µ under the bijection Ta,r(x) = x−a
r .

• Let Σ denote the support of the measure µ. We say that µ is n-uniform if there exists c > 0

such that for all x ∈ Σ, for all r > 0, the following holds:

µ(B(x, r)) = crn.

In [[P], Theorem 3.11], Preiss showed that if µ is an n-uniform measure, there exists a unique

n-uniform measure λ such that:

r−nTx,r♯µ ⇀ λ, as r → ∞,

(2.9)

for all x ∈ Rd. λ is called the tangent measure of µ at ∞.

A remarkable fact about this measure λ is the following “connectedness at ∞” for the cone of

uniform measures. The following is a version of this result formulated by X. Tolsa in [T].

Theorem 2.11 ([P]). Suppose µ is an n-uniform measure in Rd, λ its tangent at ∞.

• If n = 1, 2, then µ is ﬂat.

• If n ≥ 3, there exists a constant τ0 depending only on n and d such that, if λ satisﬁes the

following:

then µ is n-ﬂat.

βn
λ (B(0, 1)) ≤ τ0,

(2.10)

Another notion of interest is that of pseudo-tangent measures introduced by Toro and Kenig in

[KT].

Deﬁnition 2.12. Let µ be a doubling Radon measure in Rd. We say that ν is a pseudo-tangent
measure of µ at the point x ∈ suppµ if ν is a nonzero Radon measure in Rd and if there exists a
sequence of points xi ∈ suppµ such that xi → x and a sequence of positive numbers {ri} such that
ri ↓ 0 and ri

−nTxi,ri♯µ ⇀ ν.

Let us deﬁne the notion of asymptotically optimally doubling measures.

Deﬁnition 2.13. If x ∈ Σ, r > 0 and t ∈ (0, 1], deﬁne the quantity:

Rt(x, r) =

µ(B(x, tr))
µ(B(x, r))

− tn.

(2.11)

We say µ is asymptotically optimally doubling if for each compact set K ⊂ Σ, x ∈ K, and t ∈ [ 1

2 , 1]

lim
r→0+

sup
x∈K

|Rt(x, r)| = 0.

(2.12)

6

The following theorem is a useful feature of pseudo-tangent measures: they turn out to be

n-uniform if the measure they originate from is asymptotically optimally doubling.

Theorem 2.14 ([KT]). Let µ be a Radon measure in Rd that is doubling and n-asymptotically
optimally doubling. Then all pseudo-tangent measures of µ are n-uniform.

We deﬁne Ahlfors regular and locally Ahlfors regular measures.

Deﬁnition 2.15. Let µ be a Radon measure in Rd, and Σ its support.

• We say µ is Ahlfors n-regular, 0 < n ≤ d if there exists a constant c1 such that:

c−1
1 rn ≤ µ(B(x, r)) ≤ c1rn, for all x ∈ Σ, r > 0.

(2.13)

• We say µ is locally Ahlfors n-regular if for all K compact, there exist constants cK > 0 and

rK such that, for all x ∈ Σ ∩ K, 0 < r ≤ rK ,

c−1
K rn ≤ µ(B(x, r)) ≤ cK rn.

A usefool tool to obtain discreet versions of the Jones beta numbers is to decompose Σ into
dyadic cubes. David proved that such a dyadic decomposition into µ-cubes exists for the support of
Ahlfors-regular measures µ in [D]. Christ generalized this decomposition to spaces of homogeneous
type in [C].

Theorem 2.16 (Dyadic Decomposition 1, [D]). Given an Ahlfors-regular measure µ, Σ its support,
the following holds. For each j ∈ Z, there exists a family Dj of Borel subsets of Σ (the dyadic cubes
of the j-th generation) such that:

• each Dj is a partition of Σ.

• if Q ∈ Dj, Q′ ∈ Dk with k ≤ j , then either Q ⊂ Q′ or Q ∩ Q′ = ∅.

• for all j ∈ Z and Q ∈ Dj , we have diam(Q) ∼ 2−j and c−12−jn ≤ µ(Q) ≤ c2−jn.

• if Q ∈ Dj, there exists some point zQ ∈ Q (the center of Q) such that dist(zQ, Σ\Q) ≥ c2−j.

Deﬁnition 2.17. A space of homogeneous type is a set X, equipped with:

• a quasi metric d for which all the associated balls are open. The constant from the weakened

triangle inequality is denoted A0.

• a nonnegative, Borel, locally ﬁnite measure µ satisfying the doubling condition:

µ(B(x, 2r)) ≤ A1µ(B(x, r)).

Theorem 2.18 (Dyadic Decomposition 2, [C]). Suppose X is a space of homogeneous type. Then,
there exist constants δ ∈ (0, 1), a0 > 0, γ > 0, and, for each j ∈ Z, there exists a countable
collection of open subsets Dµ

j (the dyadic cubes of generation j) such that:

1. µ(X\SQ∈Dj

Q) = 0.

2. If k ≥ j, Q ∈ Dk, Q′ ∈ Dj, then either Q ⊂ Q′ or Q ∩ Q′ = ∅.

3. For each cube Q ∈ Dj and k < j, there exists a unique Q′ ∈ Dk such that : Q ⊂ Q′.

7

4. If Q ∈ Dj, then diam(Q) . δj.

5. Each Q ∈ Dj contains some ball B(zQ, a0δj).

6. If Q ∈ Dj, µ({x ∈ Q; d(x, X\Q) ≤ tδj}) . tγµ(Q), for all t > 0.
We denote Dµ = ∪j∈ZDµ

j . Given Q ∈ Dµ

j−1 which contains Q is
called the parent of Q. We say that Q is a child of Q′. Also, given Q ∈ Dµ, we denote by Dµ(Q)
the family of cubes P ∈ Dµ which are contained in Q. We also denote by Dµ
j (Q) the descendants
of Q of generation j. For Q ∈ Dµ
j , we deﬁne the side length of Q as l(Q) = 2−j . Notice that
cl(Q) ≤ diam(Q) ≤ l(Q).

j , the unique cube Q′ ∈ Dµ

For each Q ∈ Dµ, we deﬁne BQ to be the ball B(zQ, 3l(Q)), and the corresponding coeﬃcients

βn
µ (Q) = βn

µ (BQ) and bβn

µ (Q) = bβn

µ (BQ).

In Theorem 2.18, δ depends only on A0. In fact, if d is a metric (in which case A0 = 1), δ can

be replaced by 1
2 .

Putting (4) and (5) from Theorem 2.18 together, we get: diam(Q) ∼ 2−j if Q ∈ Dj.
If µ is locally Ahlfors n-regular, (4) and (5) also imply that if we ﬁx a ball B(0, ρ), then for the

cubes Q of Dj intersecting B(0, ρ), such that diam(Q) ≤ ρ, the following holds :

c−1
ρ 2−jn ≤ µ(Q) ≤ cρ2−jn.

(2.14)

When d is a metric, we will call the point zQ from (5) in Theorem 2.18 the center of Q. Note that:
dist(zQ, X\Q) & 2−k.

Using Theorem 2.18 and the remarks above, we can generalize David’s dyadic decomposition

to locally Ahlfors regular measures

Corollary 2.19. Let µ be a doubling and locally Ahlfors n-regular measure in Rd, and Dµ the
dyadic decomposition of its support from Theorem 2.18. Then:

1. each Dj is a partition of Σ.

2. if Q ∈ Dj, Q′ ∈ Dk with k ≤ j , then either Q ⊂ Q′ or Q ∩ Q′ = ∅.

3. for all j ∈ Z and Q ∈ Dj and Q ∩ K 6= ∅ where K is a compact set , we have diam(Q) ∼ 2−j

and c−1

K 2−jn ≤ µ(Q) ≤ cK 2−jn.

4. if Q ∈ Dj, there exists some point zQ ∈ Q (the center of Q) such that dist(zQ, Σ\Q) ≥ c2−j.

Deﬁnition 2.20. Let µ be a doubling measure in Rd. We say that F ⊂ Dµ is a Carleson family
if there exists some constant c > 0 such that:

XQ∈F ,Q⊂R

µ(Q) ≤ cµ(R), for all R ∈ Dµ.

The notion of uniform rectiﬁability was introduced by David and Semmes in [DS2].

It is a

quantitative version of the notion of n-rectiﬁability.

Deﬁnition 2.21. Let µ be a Radon measure in Rd, and Σ its support.

• We say µ is uniformly n-rectiﬁable if it is Ahlfors n-regular, and there exist constants θ and
M so that, for each x ∈ Σ and R > 0, there is a Lipschitz mapping g from Rn to Rd such
that g has Lipschitz norm not exceeding M and such that:

We say Σ has big pieces of Lipschitz images (BPLI).

µ(B(x, R) ∩ g(Rn)) ≥ θRn.

8

• We say µ is locally uniformly n-rectiﬁable if it is locally Ahlfors n-regular, and for every
compact set K, there exist constants RK, θK and MK so that, for each x ∈ Σ ∩ K and
0 < R ≤ RK , there is a Lipschitz mapping g from Rn to Rd such that g has Lipschitz norm
not exceeding MK and such that:

µ(B(x, R) ∩ g(Rn)) ≥ θKRn.

We now deﬁne some notions related to uniform rectiﬁability. David and Semmes proved the

following theorem in [DS2]:

Theorem 2.22 (Bilateral Weak Geometric Lemma,[DS2]). Let µ be an Ahlfors-regular measure in
Rd. Then µ is uniformly rectiﬁable if and only if it satisﬁes the Bilateral Weak Geometric Lemma
namely: for all η > 0, the family B(η) = {Q ∈ Dµ; bβn

µ (Q) > η} is a Carleson family.

Deﬁnition 2.23. Let µ be a doubling, locally Ahlfors n-regular measure. For ρ > 0, we deﬁne the
local dyadic decomposition Dρ as :

Dρ = {Q ∈ Dµ, Q ∩ B(0, ρ) 6= ∅, diam(Q) ≤ ρ}.

We say µ satisﬁes the Bilateral weak geometric lemma locally if for all ρ > 0 and for all η > 0, the
family Bρ(η) = {Q ∈ Dρ; bβn

µ (Q) > η} is a Carleson family.

Since the arguments in the proof of Theorem 2.22 are local (in the sense that the dyadic
decomposition is divided into maximal dyadic cubes, and the result is proven on each of these
cubes) and since Corollary 2.19 implies that locally the setting is the same as David’s dyadic
decomposition, its results still hold locally.

Theorem 2.24 (Local Bilateral Weak Geometric Lemma). Let µ be a doubling, locally Ahlfors n-
regular measure in Rd. Then µ is locally uniformly rectiﬁable if and only if it satisﬁes the Bilateral
Weak Geometric Lemma locally i.e., at scale ρ for some ρ > 0 namely: for all η > 0 the family
Bρ(η) = {Q ∈ Dρ; bβn

µ (Q) > η} is a Carleson family.

Our ﬁnal deﬁnition is of the Riesz transforms of a measure.

Deﬁnition 2.25. Let µ be a Radon measure in Rd. The Riesz transform of µ for z0 ∈ supp(µ),
0 < r < s is deﬁned as :

Rr,sµ(z0) =Zr≤|y−z0|≤s

y − z0

|y − z0|n+1 dµ(y).

In [T], the following estimate on the Riesz transform was an essential tool for Tolsa’s proof of

the uniform rectiﬁability of n-uniform measures.

Lemma 2.26 ([T]). Let µ be a Radon measure, Σ = suppµ, n ≤ d. Let B be a ball centered in Σ.
Suppose that there exist constants κ, c1 such that:

c−1
1 rn ≤ µ(B(x, r)) ≤ c1rn, for x ∈ B ∩ Σ, κr(B) ≤ r ≤ r(B).

Moreover, suppose that for some ǫ > 0, we have:

βd−1
µ

(B(x, r)) ≥ ǫ, for x ∈ B ∩ Σ, κr(B) ≤ r ≤ r(B).

(2.15)

(2.16)

Then, for any M > 0, there exists κ0 (κ0 = κ(M, ǫ, c1)), such that if κ ≤ κ0 , then there exists r,

3 Existence of big ﬂat balls for uniformly distributed measures

We start by proving that the Riesz transform of a uniformly distributed measure is locally bounded.
The two following lemmas are local analogues to Lemmas 3.1 and 3.4 in [T] for uniformly distributed
measures.

Lemma 3.1. Let µ be a uniformly distributed measure, dim0(µ) = n, R > 0. Let z0 ∈ Σ,
0 < r ≤ R. Then we have:

x − z0

r

where c depends only on R.

Proof. Without loss of generality, assume z0 = 0. For r,s ﬁxed, 0 < r < s ≤ R
ψ : R → R to be a compactly supported C ∞ function with the following properties:

(3.2)

We deﬁne real-valued functions ρ and Ψ respectively from R and Rd as follows:

and

ρ(u) = −Z ∞

u

ψ(t)dt, u ∈ R,

Ψ(y) = ρ(|y|), y ∈ Rd.

Since µ is uniformly distributed and Ψ is radial, for all x ∈ supp(µ), we have by Theorem 2.5

Z Ψ(x − y)dµ(y) −Z Ψ(y)dµ(y) = 0.

(3.3)

On the other hand, Taylor’s formula gives:

Ψ(x − y) − Ψ(−y) = x . ∇Ψ(−y) +

xT . ∇2Ψ(ξx,y) . x, where ξx,y ∈ [x − y, y] ⊂ Rd.

(3.4)

Note that: ∇Ψ(z) = ψ(|z|) . z

− Rr,sµ(0) =Zr≤|y|≤s

∇Ψ(−y)dµ(y)

(3.5)

since ψ(|z|) = 1

(3.6)

Let us estimate the right hand-side of (3.6).

Using the inequalities (3.1) and (3.2) and Corollary 2.3, we get the following estimates on the ﬁrst
term in (3.6):

If |y| ≤ 2r, since |x| ≤ r,we get |ξx,y| ≤ 3r and hence: (cid:12)(cid:12)∇2Ψ(ξx,y)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C

If |y| > 2r, then |y|
|y|n+1 .
Therefore, since µ is uniformly distributed, and ψ compactly supported in [−R, R], we get:

2 ≤ |x − y| ≤ 2|y| implies that |ξx,y| ∼ |y| and hence: (cid:12)(cid:12)∇2Ψ(ξx,y)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C

where C depends on R. Let us now estimate the second order derivative of Ψ using the fact that:

Lemma 3.2. Let µ be a uniformly distributed measure, n = dim0µ, n < m ≤ d, ǫ > 0. Let K be
a compact set, R = diam(K). There exist constants δ, τ depending only on ǫ, K, n and d such
µ (B) ≤ δ, then there exists a ball B′,
that: if B is a ball centered in Σ ∩ K, with r(B) ≤ R and βm
B′ ⊂ B, centered in Σ such that: βm−1

(B′) ≤ ǫ and r(B′) ≥ τ . r(B).

µ

Proof. Let L be a best approximating m-plane for βm

µ (B). In particular, for any z ∈ Σ ∩ B ,

assuming that βm
by π and deﬁne the measure ν on L to be:

µ (B) ≤ δ for a δ to be chosen later. Denote πL, the orthogonal projection onto L,

|z − π(z)| < δr(B),

(3.7)

ν(A) = µ(π−1(A) ∩ B)

for A ⊂ L.

We also denote the radius of B by r(B). Let x ∈ 1
by BL(x, r) the ball in L i.e. B(x, r) ∩ L, we have B(x, r) ⊂ π−1(BL(x, r)) ∩ B when r ≤ r(B)
hence:

2 B ∩eΣ, whereeΣ = supp ν. On one hand, denoting

2 , and

c−1rn ≤ µ(B(x, r)) ≤ ν(BL(x, r)).

On the other hand, if J is the maximal number of disjoint balls of radius r that can be contained
in π−1(BL(x, r)) ∩ 2B, then we claim that

J ≤ ωm(2r)m−d2r(B)d−m.

Indeed, assuming that L is the m-plane {(y1, . . . , yd); ym+1 = . . . = yd = 0} , the union E of these
J balls is included in the cylinder C = {y; (y1, . . . , ym) ∈ BL(x, r), yj ∈ (−2r(B), 2r(B)), j > m}.
Thus

J.Ld(B(0, r)) ≤ Ld(C),

= ωmrm2r(B)d−m.

Let {Bi} be a disjoint collection of balls of radius r such that π−1(BL(x, r)) ∩ B ∩ Σ ⊂ ∪5Bi,
obtained by a Vitali covering. In particular, by the above argument, there are at most J of them.
Then, if δr(B) ≤ r ≤ r(B), where δ is to be chosen later, we have:

ν(BL(x, r)) ≤ µ(∪5Bi) ≤ J.c.(r)n ≤ (2r)m−dr(B)d−m(2r)n ≤

Hence, letting C = c

Lemma 2.26. Let δ be small enough for (3.8) to hold, δ

Suppose z ∈ Σ ∩ B′. Then z = π(z) + πL⊥(z), where π and πL⊥ are the projections onto L and
L⊥ respectively. Since Σ ∩ B′ ⊂ Σ ∩ B and βm
µ (B) ≤ δ, we get: |πL⊥(z)| ≤ δr(B). Moreover, by
(3.10), dist(π(z), L′) ≤ ǫ

2 r(B′). Thus, for all z ∈ Σ ∩ B′,

Therefore:

dist(z, L′) ≤ |z − π(z)| + dist(π(z), L′),

Let us ﬁrst estimate (3.12). We denote the kernel of the Riesz transform by K, and the annulus
in Rd by A(z0, r0, r) = {y ∈ Rd; r0 < |y − z0| ≤ r}, the annulus in L by AL(z0, r0, r). Then, we can
write:

Rr0,rν(z0) =ZB∩π−1(AL(z0,r0,r))

K(z0 − π(y))dµ(y).

And:

|Rr0,rν(z0) − Rr0,rµ(z1)| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ S1 + S2.

Estimating S1 from (3.15):

K(z1 − y)dµ(y)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

To estimate S1, we need the following intermediate estimates. First, note that if y ∈ B ∩

π−1(A(z0, r0, r)) ∩ Σ, since |z0 − y|2 = |z0 − π(y)|2 + |π(y) − y|2 and π(y) ∈ A(z0, r0, r)

|z0 − y| ≥ |z0 − π(y)| ≥

1
2

r0

(3.16)

Second, by (3.7),

|(z0 − π(y)) − (z1 − y)| ≤ |z0 − z1| + |y − π(y)| ≤ 2δr(B).

(3.17)

Similarly, we claim that :

1
2

|z0 − y| ≤ |z0 − π(y)| ≤ 2|z0 − y| and

1
2

|z0 − y| ≤ |z1 − y| ≤ 2|z0 − y|.

(3.18)

Indeed, on one hand assuming δ small enough that δr(B) ≤ 1

2 r0,

On the other hand:

|z0 − y| ≤ |z0 − π(y)| + |π(y) − y|,

≤ |z0 − π(y)| + δr(B),

≤ |z0 − π(y)| +

1
2

r0,

≤ 2|z0 − π(y)|, by (3.16).

|z0 − π(y)| ≤ |z0 − y| + |y − π(y)|,

≤ |z0 − y| +

1
2

r0,

≤ 2|z0 − y|, by (3.7).

The other estimate in (3.18) follows similarly. On one hand,

On the other hand,

|z0 − y| ≤ |z0 − z1| + |z1 − y|,

≤ δr(B) + |z1 − y|,
≤ |z0 − π(y)| + |z1 − y|,
≤ 2|z1 − y|, since z0 = π(z1).

|z1 − y| ≤ |z1 − z0| + |z0 − y|,

≤ δr(b) + |z0 − y|,
≤ 2|z0 − y|.

Thus, to estimate S1, noting that:

We will only treat the case where π(y) ∈ A(z0, r0, r) and y /∈ A(z1, r0, r). The other case follows
in exactly the same manner. First, note that in the above case, either |y − z1| ≤ r0, implying in
particular that |y − z1| ≤ 2r0. Moreover, for such a y,

|y − z1| ≥ |π(y) − z0| − |y − π(y)| − |z1 − z0|,

≥ r0 − 2δr(B), by (3.7),

and hence, y ∈ A(z1, 1

|y − z1| ≤ |y − π(y)| + |π(y) − z0| + |z1 − z0|,

≤ 2δr(B) + r ≤ 2r

implying y ∈ A(z1, 1

that:

This implies the uniform boundedness of C.

Theorem 3.3. Let µ be a uniformly distributed measure with n = dim0µ, K a compact set. For
every ǫ > 0 , there exists some τ > 0 such that every ball B centered in Σ and contained in
K, contains another ball B′ also centered in Σ, which satisﬁes βn
µ (B′) ≤ ǫ, and r(B′) ≥ τ r(B).
Moreover, τ only depends on ǫ, K, n and d.

4 Stability of the β-numbers

In the following section, we will write β(B) for βn(B).

Lemma 4.1. Let µ be a Radon measure, Σ its support. Let µx,r be the following measure (and
Σx,r its support):

µx,r(A) = µ(rA + x).

Then we have:

bβµx,r (B) = bβµ(rB + x)

(4.1)

Proof. It is easily seen that: Σ = rΣx,r + x. Let L be an n-plane.

Let y ∈ Σx,r ∩ B. Then y′ = ry + x is in Σ ∩ Bx,r and dist(y, L) = 1

r dist(y′, L + x). Hence,

sup

dist(y, L) =

dist(y′, L + x).

(4.2)

On the other hand, let p ∈ L ∩ B. Then dist(p, Σx,r) = 1

r dist(rp + x, Σ), where rp + x = p′,

p′ ∈ (L + x) ∩ Bx,r. Hence,

sup
L∩B

dist(p, Σx,r) = sup

dist(p′, Σ).

(4.3)

Adding (4.2) and (4.3), and taking the inﬁmum over all n-planes proves (4.1).

We can now prove the following theorem. It states that the ﬂatness of µ on a ﬁxed number of

bigger scales than B implies ﬂatness at scale B.

Theorem 4.2. Let µ be a Radon measure on Rd that is doubling and n-asymptotically optimally
doubling, and K a compact set in Rd. Let ǫ > 0, and δ0 be τ0 from Theorem 2.11.
There exists an integer N > 0, depending only on ǫ, d and K such that for every ball B centered
in Σ ∩ K, if

2N B ⊂ K, βµ(2kB) ≤

, 1 ≤ k ≤ N

δ0
4

then

bβµ(B) ≤ ǫ.

Proof. We argue by contradiction. Suppose there is no such N . Then, for every j, there exists a
ball Bj = B(xj, rj), xj ∈ K ∩ Σ, 2jrj ≤ diam(K) such that:

βµ(2kBj) ≤

δ0
4

, 1 ≤ k ≤ j

but

Note that xj ∈ Σ ∩ K, 2jrj ≤ diam(K) imply that, passing to a subsequence, rj → 0 and xj → x,
x ∈ K, as j → ∞. Now, let µj be the measure deﬁned as:

bβµ(Bj) ≥ ǫ

(4.4)

µj(A) =

µ(rjA + xj)

µ(Bj)

.

18

There exists some subsequence of µj that converges weakly to a measure ν as j → ∞. Indeed,

for any ball B(0, R), if C is the doubling constant of µ, and t(R) = log(R)

log(2) , then:

µj(B(0, R)) =

µ(B(xj, Rrj)
µ(B(xj, rj)

≤ C t(R).

Therefore, supj(µj(B(0, R))) ≤ C t(R), for every R > 0.

Since xj converges to x and rj to 0, ν is a pseudo-tangent measure of µ at x, and is therefore
n-uniform by Lemma 2.14 since µ is asymptotically doubling by hypothesis. Moreover, since the
µj’s are doubling with the same constant, using Lemma 2.9 and (4.1):

2bβν (B(0, 2)) ≥ lim sup

j→∞

bβµj(B(0, 1)) = lim sup

j→∞

bβµ(Bj) ≥ ǫ.

On the other hand, for all k ≥ 0, by (4),

βν (B(0, 2k−1)) ≤ 2 lim inf
j→∞

βµj (B(0, 2k)) = 2 lim inf
j→∞

βµ(2kBj) ≤

δ0

.

Let λ be the tangent measure of ν at ∞. Deﬁne νk in the following manner:

νk(A) =

ν(2kA)

2nk

.

Then νk ⇀ λ and:

βλ(B(0, 1)) ≤ 2 lim inf
k→∞

βνk (B(0, 2)) = 2 lim inf
k→∞

βν (B(0, 2k+1) ≤ δ0.

By Theorem 2.11, this implies that ν is ﬂat, contradicting bβν (B(0, 1)) > ǫ.

Corollary 4.3. Let η > 0, K compact set in Rd, µ a measure that is doubling and asymptotically
optimally doubling. There is a constant δ1 > 0 satisfying the following property. If

k ≥ 0, B(x0, r) ⊂ K, x0 ∈ Σ ∩ K, βµ(B(x0, r)) ≤ δ1,

(4.5)

then:

bβµ(2−kB(x0, r))) ≤ η.

Proof. Let δ0 be as in Lemma 4.2, ǫ0 = min( δ0
B(x0, r) by B. Assume k ≥ N . We prove by induction that:
bβµ(Bj) ≤ ǫ0.
If 0 ≤ j ≤ N ,

bβµ(B) ≤ 2N δ1 ≤ ǫ0,

if we assume δ1 ≤ 2−N ǫ0.
If j > N , bβµ(Bj−N ) ≤ ǫ0 ≤ δ0

4 implies by Lemma 4.2 that bβµ(Bj) ≤ ǫ0. This ends the proof.

We can reformulate Theorem 4.2 and Corollary 4.3 in terms of dyadic cubes.

Corollary 4.4. Let µ be a Radon measure on Rd that is doubling, n-asymptotically doubling, and
locally Ahlfors-regular. Let Kbe a compact set, and Dµ the dyadic decomposition of µ described in
Corollary 2.19. Let ǫ > 0 and δ0 be τ0 from Theorem 2.11. There exists an integer N > 0 depending
only on ǫ, d and K such that for every R ∈ Dµ, R ⊂ K, if:

R(N ) ⊂ K, βµ(R(k)) ≤

δ0
4

, 1 ≤ k ≤ N

where R(k) denotes the ancestor of R of generation k, then

bβµ(R) ≤ ǫ.

Proof. We argue by contradiction. Suppose there is no such N . Then, for every j, if we denote the
center zRj by zj and l(Rj) by lj, there exists a dyadic cube Rj such that zj ∈ K, 2jlj ≤ diam(K),
R(j)

j ⊂ K, and

but

βµ(R(k)

j ) ≤

4

, 1 ≤ k ≤ j

bβ(Rj ) ≥ ǫ.

By compactness, there exists z ∈ supp(µ) such that zj → z (without loss of generality by passing
to a subsequence). Moreover, lj → 0. Now let µj be the measure deﬁned as:

µj(A) =

µ(ljA + zj)
µ(B(zj, 3lj))

.

(4.6)

The rest of the proof follows in exactly the same manner as Theorem 4.2 since βµ(Rj) =

βµ(B(zj, 3lj )) by deﬁnition.

Corollary 4.5. Let η > 0, K compact set in Rd, µ a measure that is doubling, asymptotically
optimally doubling and locally Ahlfors-regular. There is a constant δ1 > 0 satisfying the following
property. If

then

k ≥ 0 R ∈ Dµ R ⊂ K βµ(R) ≤ δ1,

bβµ(Q) ≤ η, for all children Q of µ.

(4.7)

(4.8)

Proof. The proof follows from Corollary 4.4 in the same manner that the proof of Corollary 4.3
follows from Theorem 4.2.

We prove that a uniformly distributed measure is doubling and asymptotically optimally dou-
bling so that we can apply Theorem 4.2 and Corollary 4.3 on one hand, and obtain a dyadic
decomposition by using Theorem 2.18 on the other hand.

Lemma 4.6. Suppose µ is a uniformly distributed Radon measure in Rd with dim0µ = n, dim∞µ =
p and such that: µ(B(x, r)) = φ(r), for x ∈ Σ. Then µ is doubling and asymptotically optimally
n-doubling.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that µ is doubling. This follows easily from Theorem 2.4. Indeed, if x ∈
supp(µ), r > 0

µ(B(x, 2r)) ≤ 10dµ(B(x, r)).

20

To prove that µ is n-asymptotically optimally doubling, let K be a compact set such that

K ∩ Σ 6= ∅, and τ ∈ (0, 1). Choose x in K ∩ Σ. Then

Theorem 4.7. Let µ be a uniformly distributed measure on Rd, K compact set in Rd. Fix η > 0.
Then there exists a constant c > 0, depending on n, d, K and η with the following property: for
every ball B centered in Σ ∩ K, there exists a ball B′ centered in Σ ∩ K, B′ ⊂ B, and r(B′) ≥ cr(B)
such that for every k ≥ 0,

bβ(2−kB′) ≤ η.

Proof. Let δ1 be the constant from Corollary 4.3 corresponding to η, δ1 = δ1(η). Let δ0 and N be
the constants from Theorem 4.2 corresponding to δ1, and let B′′ be the ball given by Theorem 3.3
and τ the constant given by the same theorem, corresponding to 2−N δ0, i.e. τ = τ (2−N δ0).

Then we have B′′ ⊂ B, r(B′′) ≥ τ r(B) and β(B′′) ≤ 2−N δ0. Hence, for 0 ≤ k ≤ N , β(2−kB′′) ≤
r(B′′)
2−kr(B′′) β(B′′) ≤ δ0. Let B′ = 2−N B′′. We have: β(2kB′) ≤ δ0, for all 1 ≤ k ≤ N . By Theorem
4.2, this implies that bβ(B′) ≤ δ1, which in turn, by Corollary 4.3, gives bβ(2−kB′) ≤ η for each
k ≥ 0. Letting c = 2−N τ , we end the proof. Note that c does not depend on our choice of B.

The following corollaries are reformulations of the above theorems in terms of the dyadic de-

composition of Σ, which will be useful in the proof of Theorem 5.1:

Corollary 4.8. Let µ be a uniformly distributed measure, n = dim0µ, K a compact set. Fix
δ1 > 0. Then there exists a constant c1 such that: if R ∈ Dµ, R ⊂ K, there exists R′ ∈ Dµ(R),
l(R′) ≥ c1 l(R) with bβ(R′) ≤ ǫ.

Proof. Let R ⊂ K be a cube in the dyadic decomposition. By Theorem 2.18, there exists a ball
B = B(zR, a0l(R)) such that B ∩ Σ ⊂ R and diam(B) = 2a0l(R) for some a0 depending only on µ.
Let δ1 = δ1(ǫ) the δ1 corresponding to ǫ from Corollary 4.4. Use Theorem 3.3 to ﬁnd a ball
B′ ⊂ B such that r(B′) ≥ τ l(R) and βµ(B′) ≤ δ1. Denote the center of B′ by z′. Let R′ be the
largest dyadic cube such that R′ ⊂ B′

in particular. Moreover

4 .Then l(R′) ≥ r(B′)

8

βµ(R′) ≤ 2βµ(B(z′, 6l(R′)) ≤

6

βµ(B′).

(4.9)

Therefore, l(R′) ≥ cl(R) for some absolute c, and βµ(R′) ≤ δ1. Applying Corollary 4.4 to R′ ends
the proof.

5 Local uniform rectiﬁability of uniformly distributed measures

We can now prove our main theorem for uniformly distributed measures.

Theorem 5.1. Let µ be a uniformly distributed measure in Rd. Then µ is locally uniformly
rectiﬁable.

Proof. Fix ρ > 0. Recall Dρ = {Q ∈ Dµ, Q ∩ B(0, ρ) 6= ∅, diam(Q) ≤ ρ}.

By Corollary 2.3, there exists c depending on ρ such that: for all x ∈ Σ, 0 < r ≤ 11ρ,

c−1rn ≤ µ(B(x, r)) ≤ crn.

We want to prove that Σ satisﬁes the Bilateral Weak Geometric Lemma locally. In other words,
choosing η > 0, and ρ > 0, we want to prove that Bρ(η) = {Q ∈ Dρ; bβ(Q) > η} is a Carleson
family. Note that Q ∈ Dρ implies that Q ⊂ B(0, 11ρ). Let δ1 = δ1(η) from Corollary 4.5, and let
c = c(δ1) be the constant c1 in Corollary 4.8 corresponding to δ1.

Now, pick R ∈ Dρ. Our aim is to show that:

XQ∈D(R)∩B(η)

µ(Q) ≤ Cµ(R).

Deﬁne the families of cubes F and H in the following manner:

F = {P ∈ D(R); bβ(P ) ≤ δ1, P maximal with respect to that property},

and

H = {Q ∈ D(R) ∩ B(η); Q is not contained in any P ∈ F}.

We ﬁrst claim that: H = B(η) ∩ D(R).
Indeed, let Q ∈ D(R) be such that Q is not in H. Then there exists P ∈ F such that Q ⊂ P .
Corollary 4.5 then implies that bβµ(Q) ≤ η, i.e. Q is not in B(η). Hence we only need to prove
that

µ(Q) ≤ cµ(R).

XQ∈H

But each Q ∈ H contains some P ∈ F of maximal side length such that l(P ) ≥ c′ l(Q), by
Corollary 4.8. Call P = f (Q). (If there is more than one choice, since they must be of the same
side length, any choice of P will do). Therefore:

XQ∈H

µ(Q) ≤ XQ∈H

c µ(f (Q)) ≤ cXP ∈F

µ(P ) ≤ cµ(R),

where the last inequality follows from the fact that the elements of F are disjoint.
