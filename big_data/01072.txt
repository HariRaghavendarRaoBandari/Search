We report the results of a study aimed at quantifying the impact on the oscillation analysis of
the uncertainties associated with the description of the neutrino-nucleus cross section in the two-
particle–two-hole sector. The results of our calculations, based on the kinematic method of energy
reconstruction and carried out comparing two data-driven approaches, show that the existing dis-
crepancies in the neutrino cross sections have a sizable eﬀect on the extracted oscillation parameters,
particularly in the antineutrino channel.

The T2K Collaboration has recently reported two mea-
surements of the inclusive cross section for charged-
current (CC) muon-neutrino scattering oﬀ the hydrocar-
bon target, CH [1, 2]. Being ﬂux-averaged at diﬀerent
mean-energy values, the T2K results show the cross sec-
tion as a function of neutrino energy with minimal de-
pendence on nuclear models.
While the T2K data are lower by ∼20% than the ﬂux-
averaged hydrocarbon result previously obtained by the
SciBooNE Collaboration [3], with the diﬀerence exceed-
ing the experimental uncertainties, they seem to be in
a good agreement with the expectations based on the
6C(νµ, µ−)X cross section measured at higher energies
12
by the NOMAD experiment [4].

At the kinematics of the T2K and SciBooNE experi-
ments, momentum transfers q are typically large enough
for neutrinos—probing nuclear interior with the spatial
resolution ∼ 1/|q|—to scatter oﬀ individual (bound) nu-
cleons. On the other hand, the dominant contribution
to the cross section comes from low energy transfers ω,
insuﬃcient to produce pions, and the quasielastic (QE)
mechanisms of interaction,

play the most important role.

In the past, CC QE processes were considered well un-
derstood theoretically, and used to determine the ﬂux
normalization [5]. Recently, however, it has become ap-
parent that this is not the case to the extent required by
precise oscillation experiments [6]. For example, while
the CC QE cross sections of carbon reported by the
MiniBooNE Collaboration [7, 8] turn out to be higher
than those of free nucleons, the corresponding NOMAD
data [9] show the cross-sections’ reduction arising from
nuclear eﬀects. Although those puzzling discrepancies

has received a great deal of theoretical interest, their in-
terpretation is not fully established so far.

In particular, while a non-negligible role of CC QE re-
action mechanisms involving more than one nucleon is
now generally acknowledged, and important theoretical
progress has been achieved [10], an ab initio estimate of
the corresponding cross sections is not yet available. As
those multinucleon mechanisms involve predominantly
two nucleons, hereafter we refer to them as two-particle–
two-hole (2p2h) processes.

For nuclear targets ranging from carbon to iron, a
growing body of experimental evidence [7, 11–15] shows
that 2p2h eﬀects on the diﬀerential QE cross sections
can be eﬀectively accounted for by increasing the value
of the axial mass MA, typically to ∼1.2 GeV, with respect
to MA = 1.03 GeV extracted predominantly from deu-
terium measurements [16]. Note that as the axial mass
is the cut-oﬀ parameter driving the axial form factor’s
dependence on Q2 = q2 − ω2, its changes aﬀect both the
diﬀerential and total cross sections.

In this article, we discuss uncertainties of the 2p2h
cross sections for carbon and quantify their eﬀect on the
oscillation analysis for an experimental setup similar to
that of T2K [20]. We consider a disappearance exper-
iment running in both neutrino and antineutrino mode
with the same ﬂux [21], peaked at ∼600 MeV. To describe
the ground-state properties of the target nucleus, we use
the realistic spectral function (SF) of Ref. [22]. This ap-
proach allows an accurate estimate of QE scattering in-
duced by one-nucleon currents, as shown by an extensive
comparison to electron-scattering data in Ref. [23]. To
account for an increase of the CC QE cross sections due to
2p2h processes, we use two data-driven phenomenological
methods: (i) an increased value of the axial mass, yield-
ing results consistent with the T2K [1, 2], NOMAD [4, 9],
and MINERvA [17, 18] data, and (ii) the 2p2h estimate in
the genie Monte Carlo generator [24], determined from
the MiniBooNE data [7] and in agreement with the ex-
perimental cross sections extracted from SciBooNE [3].

Consequences of 2p2h eﬀects for the CC QE cross

SF approach with MA = 1.2 GeV (solid line) are compared with the carbon data reported by the MiniBooNE [7, 8] and
NOMAD [9] Collaborations, and the hydrocarbon data extracted from the MINERvA [17, 18] and T2K [14, 19] experiments.
For comparison, the MiniBooNE data divided by 1.2 are also shown.

sections have been analyzed within a few eﬀective ap-
proaches. The calculations of Martini et al. [25–28],
based on the local Fermi gas model and the random-phase
approximation (RPA), extend the treatment of multinu-
cleon contributions to the electromagnetic responses of
iron developed by Alberico et al. [29] to the case of neu-
trino interactions with carbon, and to broader kinematic
region.

While employing the local Fermi gas model and the
RPA scheme, the approach of Nieves et al. [30–33] diﬀers
from that of Martini et al. by using eﬀective interactions,
the parameters of which were ﬁxed in earlier studies of
photon, electron, and pion scattering oﬀ nuclei. At the
MiniBooNE kinematics, the CC QE νµ (¯νµ) cross sections
obtained by Nieves et al. are lower by ∼10% (∼15%) with
respect to those calculated by Martini et al.

To extend their superscaling approach and include
the contributions of processes involving two-nucleon cur-
rents, Amaro et al. [34, 35] and Megias et al. [36, 37] have
estimated the 2p2h cross sections within the relativis-
tic Fermi gas model, accounting for the vector meson-
exchange currents only. Further eﬀorts to include the
axial part are reported to be ongoing [38, 39].

In the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck trans-
port model, the 2p2h contribution to the CC QE cross
sections is obtained from a ﬁt to the MiniBooNE data
performed by Lalakulich et al. [40], using physically well-
motivated ansatz.

The genie Monte Carlo generator [41] simulates 2p2h
events following the empirical procedure developed by
Dytman [24], based on the one derived for electron scat-
tering in Ref. [42]. The kinematics of the produced lepton
is distributed according to the magnetic contribution to
the elementary cross section and, as a consequence, turns
out to be the same for neutrinos and antineutrinos. The
2p2h strength is set to decrease linearly for neutrino en-
ergy larger than 1 GeV and to vanish at 5 GeV, con-
sistently with both the MiniBooNE [7] and NOMAD [9]

data. genie is employed in data analysis by a number of
neutrino experiments [43], as well as in phenomenological
estimates of the impact of nuclear eﬀects on the determi-
nation of oscillation parameters, following the pioneering
studies carried out by the authors of Ref. [44].

In this article, we analyze how the oscillation analy-
sis may be aﬀected by uncertainties in the description of
2p2h contributions to the CC QE cross sections, com-
paring two estimates obtained from diﬀerent approaches.
In the ﬁrst case, we apply an eﬀective value of the axial
mass MA = 1.2 GeV to account for the modiﬁcations of
the QE cross sections due to 2p2h reaction mechanisms
in a purely phenomenological manner (“eﬀective” calcu-
lations).
In the second case, we add the 2p2h results
obtained using genie 2.8.0 [24] to the QE calculations
performed using the SF approach with MA = 1.03 GeV,
as implemented in the νT package of additional mod-
ules [45] (“genie+νT” calculations).

The obtained total CC QE cross sections are compared
to the experimental data in Fig. 1.
It clearly appears
that the eﬀective calculations are in good agreement with
the NOMAD [9] and MINERvA [17, 18] results for both
neutrinos and antineutrinos. They also reproduce the
energy dependence of the MiniBooNE data [7, 8], but
not their absolute normalization. To better illustrate this
feature, we have divided the MiniBooNE cross sections
by factor 1.2, consistent with the ratio of the detected
to predicted events of 1.21 ± 0.24 reported from the ﬁrst
MiniBooNE analysis [12].

While for neutrinos, the 2p2h contribution from genie
is in very good agreement with the MiniBooNE data, for
antineutrinos it overestimates the experimental points,
in spite of being added to the SF results obtained us-
ing MA = 1.03 GeV, which are too low to reproduce the
cross sections from NOMAD [46]. Owing to their large
uncertainties, the T2K CC QE data [14, 19] cannot dis-
criminate between the two calculations.

sections for resonant, nonresonant, and coherent pion
production from genie, we have calculated the inclu-
sive CC cross sections for carbon shown in Fig. 2. The
two considered approaches turn out to be in good agree-
ment with the NOMAD data [4], collected in the region
dominated by pion production.

To compare to the T2K [1, 2] and SciBooNE [3] data,
extracted for the hydrocarbon target, we have accounted
for the contribution of free protons using the cross sec-
tions from genie. While the on-axis T2K data point [2]
does not distinguish the two approaches, the SciBooNE
point [3] clearly favors the genie+νT calculations and
the oﬀ-axis T2K point [1] shows a distinct preference for

the eﬀective calculations.

The puzzling diﬀerence between the T2K and Sci-
BooNE data—interesting in its own right—has impor-
tant consequences for neutrino-oscillation studies. We
discuss them for the νµ and ¯νµ disappearance analysis of
an experiment using an oﬀ-axis (2.5◦) beam peaked at
∼600 MeV [21]. The near (far) detector of the ﬁducial
mass of 1.0 (22.5) kton is located at a distance of 1 (295)
km from the neutrino source.

We consider the kinematic method of energy recon-
struction, applying it to all event types as in Ref. [47].
As neutral-current background is expected not to play
an important role, we do not take it into account. Our
analysis employs globes [48–50], and is based on ∼6000
unoscillated events with reconstructed energies between
0.3 and 1.7 GeV, in both the neutrino and antineutrino
modes. The oscillation-parameter values assumed as the
true ones are detailed in Table I. Implementing χ2, we
apply a 20% systematic uncertainty of the shape (nor-

Before discussing the oscillation results, it is illustra-
tive to compare the reconstructed energy distributions for
muon neutrinos and antineutrinos obtained from the ge-
nie+νT and eﬀective calculations. As shown in Fig. 3,
the diﬀerences between the two cross-section estimates
translate into diﬀerences between the oscillated event
rates in the far detector, the discrepancies being partic-
ularly severe in the case of antineutrinos.

The obtained conﬁdence regions are shown in Fig. 4.
The shaded areas represent the results for the genie+νT
ﬁtted rates, and the solid lines correspond to the ﬁtted
rates from the eﬀective calculations. The high values of
χ2
best-ﬁt per degree of freedom, given in Fig. 4, clearly
indicate that the diﬀerences between the two considered
approaches are too large to be neglected in a precise os-
cillation analysis. We have veriﬁed that this observation
holds true even when the normalization of the QE event
sample, with any number of nucleons, is treated as arbi-
trary. Therefore, the observed eﬀect can be traced back
to the shape discrepancies displayed in Fig. 1, which ap-
pear to be particularly large for antineutrinos.

In summary, we have studied the impact of discrep-
ancies between experimental cross sections on neutrino-

oscillation analysis, adopting the kinematic method of en-
ergy reconstruction. We have compared two-data driven
approaches focusing on the 1-GeV energy region, and
shown that the diﬀerences between them have a sizable
eﬀect on the resulting oscillation parameters, especially
in the antineutrino channel.

In view of these ﬁndings, improving the precision of the
neutrino and antineutrino cross sections will be of great
importance for future oscillation studies. Such a progress
will require new experimental data for energies ∼1 GeV,
as well as an improvement in the understanding of sys-
tematic uncertainties, that would allow to signiﬁcantly
alleviate the tensions between existing measurements.

Because the description of ﬁnal-state hadrons involves
larger uncertainties than those associated with leptons,
the conclusions of this article are expected to also ap-
ply to the calorimetric method of energy reconstruction,
and are therefore relevant to the next generation of long-
baseline oscillation measurements, such as the Deep Un-
derground Neutrino Experiment [51], aimed at determin-
ing the charge-parity violating phase and veriﬁcation of
the three-neutrino paradigm.
