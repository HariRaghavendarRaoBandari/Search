ABSTRACT

Context. The dense, cold regions where high-mass stars form are poorly characterised, yet they represent an ideal opportunity to
learn more about the initial conditions of high-mass star formation (HMSF), since high-mass starless cores (HMSCs) lack the violent
feedback seen at later evolutionary stages.
Aims. To investigate the initial conditions of HMSF by studying the dynamics and chemistry of HMSCs.
Methods. We present continuum maps obtained from the Submillimeter Array (SMA) interferometry at 1.1 mm for four infrared dark
clouds (IRDCs, G28.34S, IRDC 18530, IRDC 18306, and IRDC 18308). For these clouds, we also present line surveys at 1 mm/3 mm
obtained from IRAM 30 m single-dish observations.
Results. (1) At an angular resolution of 2(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼ 104 AU at an average distance of 4 kpc), the 1.1 mm SMA observations resolve each
source into several fragments. The mass of each fragment is on average > 10M(cid:12), which exceeds the predicted thermal Jeans mass of
the whole clump by a factor of up to 60, indicating that thermal pressure does not dominate the fragmentation process. Our measured
velocity dispersions in the 30 m lines imply that non-thermal motions provides the extra support against gravity in the fragments. (2)
Both non-detection of high-J transitions and the hyperﬁne multiplet ﬁt of N2H+ (J = 1 → 0), C2H (N = 1 → 0), HCN (J = 1 → 0),
and H13CN (J = 1 → 0), indicate that our sources are cold and young. However, obvious detection of SiO and the asymmetric line
proﬁle of HCO+ (J = 1 → 0) in G28.34 S indicate a potential protostellar object and probable infall motion. (3) With a large number of
N-bearing species, the existence of carbon rings and molecular ions, and the anti-correlated spatial distributions between N2H+/NH2D
and CO, our large-scale high-mass clumps exhibit similar chemical features as small-scale low-mass prestellar objects.
Conclusions. This study of a small sample of IRDCs illustrates that thermal Jeans instability alone cannot explain the fragmentation
of the clump into cold (T ∼ 15 K), dense (> 105 cm−3) cores and that these IRDCs are not completely quiescent.

1. Introduction
The high temperatures (> 50K) and densities (> 105 cm−3) in
high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs; Beuther et al. 2002)
give rise to a rich spectrum of molecular lines and so HMPOs
are fruitful objects for study. Their formation mechanism, how-
ever, is still under debate. Before the protostellar object exists,
the so-called “high-mass starless (prestellar) cores” (HMSCs,
Beuther et al. 2009), form in the densest “clumps” within the
infrared-dark clouds (IRDCs). Following the literatures, we
deﬁne the following structure hierarchy. IRDCs are large-scale
(several tens of pc; Jackson et al. 2010; Beuther et al. 2011;
Wang et al. 2014), ﬁlamentary structures; “clumps” are dense
gas of order ∼ 1 pc (Zhang et al. 2009); HMSCs usually have
high density (n ≥ 103–105 cm3, Teyssier et al. 2002; Rathborne
et al. 2006; Butler & Tan 2009; Vasyunina et al. 2009; Ragan
et al. 2009) and small sizes (on scale of ∼ 0.1pc). On the
smallest scale (∼ 0.01 pc), HMSCs harbour some internal struc-
tures, the “condensations”. The prestellar phase of high-mass
sources is not well constrained observationally, owing to its
short duration, the sources large average distance (several kpc),
and characteristicly low temperatures (T < 20K, Carey et al.

1998; Sridharan et al. 2005; Pillai et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2008;
Wienen et al. 2012; Chira et al. 2013) leading to little excitation.
In fact, even the existence of HMSCs has been questioned
(e.g., Motte et al. 2007) until large survey samples were able
to constrain the collapse timescale (on the order of 5× 104 yrs,
e.g., Russeil et al. 2010; Tackenberg et al. 2012).

The Herschel guaranteed time key programme “The Earliest
Phases of Star Formation (EPoS)” surveyed a sample of 45
IRDCs (Ragan et al. 2012b). This survey revealed several
instances of 70 µm dark regions corresponding to peaks in
submillimetre dust emission from the ATLASGAL1. These
sources are ideal locations to seek for HMSCs (e.g.,Beuther
et al. 2010; Henning et al. 2010; Linz et al. 2010; Beuther et al.
2012; Ragan et al. 2012b) and are prime targets with which
to address several outstanding questions about
the starless
phase. (1) What is the structure of HMSCs? What governs
their fragmentation (e.g., Zhang et al. 2009; Bontemps et al.
2010; Zhang & Wang 2011; Beuther et al. 2013; Zhang et al.
2015)? (2) Is thermal pressure suﬃcient to support HMSCs

against collapse (e.g., Wang et al. 2011, 2014)? (3) What are
the chemical properties of HMSCs, and how do they compare
to more advanced phases (e.g., Miettinen et al. 2011; Vasyunina
et al. 2011)?

To investigate these questions, we select a sample of
four “quiescent”2
IRDC candidates from the EPoS sample:
G28.34 S, IRDC 18530, IRDC 18306 and IRDC 18308. The
kinematic distances (D) range from 3.6 to 4.6 kpc. We describe
our SMA and IRAM 30-meter telescope observations in Section
2 and present the maps in Section 3. Our analyses of the
kinematics and chemistry are presented in Section 4, and we
summarise in Section 5.

2. Observations
2.1. Submillimeter Array (SMA)
We carried out four-track observations on our sample with the
SMA at 260/270 GHz (1.1 mm) using the extended (EXT) and
compact (COMP) conﬁgurations (summarized in Table 1.I).
From May to July 2013, we observed 2 sources per track, which
share bandpass and ﬂux calibrators. For all the observations,
phase and amplitude calibrations were performed via frequent
switch (every 20 min) on quasars 1743-038 and 1751+096.
The primary beam size is 48(cid:48)(cid:48). The phase center for each target
is pinned down to the 870 µm ATLASGAL continuum peak
(Schuller et al. 2009), which is listed in Table 1.II. The baselines
(BL) range from 16 m to 226 m with 6 or 7 antennas (Nant) on
diﬀerent days, making structure with extent ≥ 10
(cid:48)(cid:48)
being ﬁltered
out. Bandpass calibrations were done with BL Lac (EXT),
3C 279 (EXT, COMP), and 3C 84 (COMP). Flux calibrations
were estimated using Neptune (EXT) and Uranus (COMP). The
zenith opacities, measured with water vapour monitors mounted
on Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) or James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), were satisfactory during all tracks
with τ(225 GHz) ∼ 0.01–0.3. Further technical descriptions of
the SMA and its calibration schemes can be found in Ho et al.
(2004).

The double sideband receiver was employed, and we tuned
the center of the spectral band 22 in the lower sideband as
the rest frequency of H13CO+ (3 → 2) line, 260.255 GHz.
Separated by 10 GHz, the frequency coverages are 258.100–
261.981 GHz (LSB) and 269.998–273.876 GHz (USB). Each
sideband has a total bandwidth of 4 GHz and a native fre-
quency resolution of 0.812 MHz (a velocity resolution of
0.936 kms−1). The frequency resolutions in the spectral win-
dows of 260.221–260.299 GHz and 271.679–271.757 GHz
are 0.406 MHz (corresponding to a velocity resolution of
0.468 kms−1); frequency resolution in the spectral windows of
260.041–260.221 GHz and 271.757–271.937 GHz is 1.625 MHz
(velocity resolution of 1.872 kms−1).

The ﬂagging and calibration was done with the MIR
package3. The imaging and data analysis was conducted with
2 IRDCs are classiﬁed as “active” if they host protostellar dominated
cores and “quiescent” if they host prestellar dominated cores, depending
on whether both 4.5 and 24 µm emission is detected (Chambers et al.
2009; Rathborne et al. 2010).

3 MIR package was originally developed for the Owens Valley
Radio Observatory, and is now adapted for the SMA, http://cfa-
www.harvard.edu/∼cqi/mircook.html.

MIRIAD (Sault et al. 1995). The synthesized beams and 1σ
rms of the continuum image from dual-sidebands at each
conﬁguration are listed in Table 1.II, along with the results by
combining conﬁgurations with natural weighting. We also list
the 1σ rms of the primary beam averaged spectrum of each
source.

2.2. Single-dish observations with the IRAM 30 m telescope
In addition to the high spatial resolution observations performed
with the SMA, we conducted an imaging line survey of our sam-
ple with the IRAM 30 m telescope at 1 mm/3 mm. Observations
were performed in the on-the-ﬂy mode from May 28th –May
30th 2014, mapping a 1.5(cid:48) × 1.5(cid:48) area of each source. A broad
bandpass (8 GHz bandwidth for each sideband) of EMIR cov-
ers the range of 85.819–93.600 GHz (E0) with a velocity res-
olution of 0.641 kms−1, and 215.059–222.841 GHz (E2) with
a velocity resolution of 0.265 kms−1. After achieving the ex-
pected sensitivity, we tuned the band center on May 31st and
observed an “extra band” of 85.119–92.900 GHz and 217.059–
224.841 GHz to search for more lines. The phase center, the
weather conditions, focus and pointing information are listed in
Table 24. Using a forward eﬃciency (Feﬀ, 94% at 1mm and 95%
at 3 mm) and a main beam eﬃciency (Beﬀ, 63% at 1mm and 81%
at 3 mm)5, we converted the data from antenna temperature (TA)
to main beam brightness temperature (Tmb = Feﬀ/Beﬀ ×TA). The
beam of the 30 m telescope is ∼ 12(cid:48)(cid:48) at 1 mm and ∼ 30(cid:48)(cid:48) at 3 mm.
We used the Gildas6 software for data reduction and the ﬁrst step
line identiﬁcation (Table 3)7. The 1σ rms Tmb in the line free
channels are 6-8 mK at 3 mm and 26-33 mK at 1 mm.

3. Observational Results
3.1. Fragmentation on small scale from SMA observations
As shown in Figure 1, our sources locate on the ATLASGAL
870 µm continuum peaks of the pc-scale ﬁlaments (shown as
red contours in the left column). All targets are embedded in
the Herschel 70 µm dark clouds (Ragan et al. 2012a), and each
of them is away from the 70 µm bright region at a projected
distance of ∼ 1–2 pc (1(cid:48)–2(cid:48)). At an angular resolution of
∼2(cid:48)(cid:48) (corresponding to 104 AU on linear scales), the 1.1 mm
SMA observations resolve each 870 µm continuum peak into
several compact substructures (“fragments” hereafter, which are
plotted as black contours in the middle and right columns of
Figure 1). Combined with the “natural weighting”, observations
with the COMP+EXT conﬁguration achieve a relatively high
angular resolution, but high sensitivity only to the compact
structures. Observations with the COMP conﬁguration, how-
ever, achieve a higher signal to noise ratio and recover some
extended structures of the envelope, so they are essential for
studying the morphology of the fragments, e.g., size, mass, etc.

We ﬁnd 2–4 fragments per source with continuum emission
levels > 3σ rms in both the COMP and COMP+EXT maps.
4 The SMA continuum peak of each source has some shift from its
observational phase center. Therefore, we set the 30 m mapping cen-
ter according to the SMA continuum peak and use Gildas software to
“reproject” the SMA oﬀset accordingly.

These fragments have typical sizes of 0.05–0.2 pc and masses
of 4–62 M(cid:12). They are mostly separated at a projected distance
of 0.07–0.24 pc (see Table 4I and discussion in Section 4.1).
In particular, fragments in G28.34 S and IRDC 18308 are well
aligned along the large-scale ﬁlamentary direction. The spatial
resolution of our observations only allow to resolve the “core”
structure, so we cannot tell whether the cores contain further hi-
erarchic fragmentations into condensations or stay as monolithic
objects in this paper.

and HNC (3 → 2, Eu/kB = 26 K). However, none of them has
> 4σ rms emission at 1.1 mm. Possible explanations for this in-
cluded: (1) These species were tracing the more extended struc-
tures which our observations are not sensitive to. (2) Their emis-
sion was too faint to detect, given the sensitivity of our SMA
observations. (3) These high-J lines were not yet excited in these
young, cold HMSCs. Our new IRAM 30 m line survey now re-
covers the extended structure information with 3–10 times more
sensitivity than the SMA observations. We now detect emission
from lower-J transitions of the above species at 3 mm.

1 mm/3 mm band (Table 3, the lines detected only in the “extra
band” are in blue). Most of them are so-called “late depleters”
which have low critical densities, low Eu/kB and low binding en-
ergies, and thus are hard to deplete onto grain surfaces (Bergin
2003). Although IRDC 18306 is the nearest source in our sam-
ple, its lines have the lowest brightness temperatures. In con-
trast, G28.34 S has the largest number of detected lines which
have the highest brightness temperatures in our sample, indicat-
ing this source may be relatively chemically more evolved than
the others in our sample.

3.2.2. Molecular spatial distribution

When a high-mass star-forming region (HMSFR) is in the
early chemical stages, diﬀerent species trace gas with diﬀerent
temperatures and densities. Therefore, the spatial distribution
diversity from diﬀerent species can tell us the chemical status of
a particular host source.

From Figure 2, G28.34 S has the largest number of emission
lines, so we use this source for line identiﬁcation and list all
the detections (having emission > 4σ rms) in Table 3. The
line proﬁles as plotted in Figure A1 show that some lines
have blended multiplets. To account for this multiplicity when
mapping the distribution of all identiﬁed species in each source,
we integrate each line according to its detection and multiplet
using the below rules.
• For a line which has ≥ 4σ detection in a particular source, if
it contains multiplet, we ﬁt the strongest multiplet transitions
using the Hyperﬁne-Structure (HFS) ﬁt; otherwise, we ﬁt it
using a Gaussian proﬁle9 (as discussed in Section 4.3.1 and
listed in Table A1)10. Subsequently, we map the integrated
intensities of these lines over their velocity range (down to
where the line goes into the noise, Table A2).
• If a G28.34 S-detection species has < 4σ detection in another
particular source, we integrate 3 channels in total around the
systematic Vlsr at the rest frequency of its strongest transition
(marked with “*” in Table A2) in that source b.

Figure 3 presents the spatial distributions of all the detected
species in our sample. We note that
the intensity of some lines
in the 70 µm bright sources in our ﬁeld of view (∼1(cid:48) NE to
G28.34S, IRDC 18530, and NW to IRDC 18308) are stronger
than in our target 70 µm dark sources, which makes the spatial
origin of these species hard to judge. Therefore, we plot the
contour that marks the half maximum integrated intensity
of a particular species (the black contours in Figure 3).
In
general, most species show the strongest emission towards
the 870 µm continuum peak. We note molecular emission
peaks in IRDC 18306 and IRDC 18308 have a systematic
oﬀset of ∼ 5(cid:48)(cid:48)–10(cid:48)(cid:48) north to the continuum peak. This may
be caused by the pointing uncertainties between 30 m and
APEX. Nevertheless, comparison among the sources reveals
some similarities and special features of the species, as we now
outline in more detail for diﬀerent types of chemistry. Figure A1

Feng et al.: Are the Infrared Dark Clouds Really Quiescent?

– Nitrogen (N-) bearing species have the largest number of
lines detected in our 30 m observations. Previous studies
especially towards low-mass star-forming regions (e.g.,
Lee et al. 2001; Pirogov et al. 2003; Fuller et al. 2005;
Ragan et al. 2006; Sanhueza et al. 2012; Fontani et al.
2014) show that
these species usually trace the cold,
dense gas, because of their large dipole moments, or
relatively low optical depths, or simple linear structures
(e.g., HC3N, Bergin et al. 1996). Among them, the abun-
dance of NH2D can be enhanced by deuteration from NH3
+ HD → H2D+ + H2 + ∆E) when CO has frozen out onto
(H+
3
the dust grains (T < 20 K, Crapsi et al. 2005; Chen et al.
2010; Pillai et al. 2011); HCN (H13CN) is a well-known
infall tracer in low-mass prestellar environment (e.g., Sohn
et al. 2007); the ratio of HCN/HNC (H13CN/HN13C) is
strongly temperature dependent–high in the warmer region
like Orion GMC (Goldsmith et al. 1986; Schilke et al. 1992)
and approximately around unity (Sarrasin et al. 2010) in the
cold environment (see discussion in Section 4.4); multiplets
of N2H+ are commonly used to reveal us the excitation
temperature of this species (e.g., Caselli et al. 2002a, see
also Table 5) in the dark, quiescent regions. All these species
have emission peaks or strong emission coincident with
the 870 µm continuum peaks, and the oﬀsets in between
them are less than the 30 m-APEX pointing uncertainty. In
particular, isotopologues of HNC and HCN are co-spatial
in sources except for HCN (H13CN) in IRDC 18308. This
exception may be explained by the abnormal enhancement
or suppression of the individual hyperﬁne line discussed in
Section 4.3.1, indicating non-LTE (local thermal equilib-
rium) excitations of HCN (Loughnane et al. 2012).

Besides the simple N-bearing species, HNCO is the sim-
plest organic species containing C, H, O, and N elements.
Moreover, it has been suggested as a shock tracer, based on
its correlated spatial distribution with SiO (e.g., Zinchenko
et al. 2000) and CH3OH (e.g., Meier & Turner 2005). We
found extended emission of HNCO in all our dark, cold
clumps. The velocity dispersion of this line is similar to the
other lines (1− 3kms−1) on the scale of 0.8 pc, so we are not
able to tell whether the shocks are from cloud-cloud colli-
sion (e.g., Jim´enez-Serra et al. 2009, 2010; Nguyen-Lu’o’ng
et al. 2013) or from protostellar objects deeply embedded.

– Carbon oxidised and hydride species

are important
indicators of the chemical status of a particular star-forming
region. As one of the most abundant molecules in the gas
phase, possessing a low dipole moment and low critical
density, CO isotopologues (13CO, C18O, and C17O) can
be used to indicate the gas temperature (e.g., Tafalla et al.
1998; Pineda et al. 2008, see also Appendix B). HCO+
is the typical dense gas tracer produced from CO, and its
abundance is enhanced in regions with a high ionization
fraction and/or shocked by outﬂows (e.g., Codella et al.
2001; Hofner et al. 2001; Rawlings et al. 2000, 2004). H2CO
is an important carbon hydride which forms CH3OH and
other more complex organics later in the gas phase (e.g.,
Horn et al. 2004; Garrod et al. 2008); sublimation of this
species needs a warmer environment, so the detection of this
species indicates the host cloud may be in a more evolved
phase.

These species show the following features in G28.34S: (1) a
clear anti-correlated distribution between CO isotopologues

12

(especially the optically thin 2 → 1 lines of C18O and C17O)
and N2H+/NH2D/H13CO+, indicating strong depletion and
ionization even on the scale of 0.8 pc (see discussion in
Section 4.5); (2) a blue asymmetric line proﬁle of the opti-
cally thick HCO+ (1 → 0) comparing to H13CO+ (1 → 0),
indicating possible large velocity of infall motion (Myers
et al. 1996; Mardones et al. 1997, see Figure 4 and Section
4.3 for detailed discussion); (3) > 4σ line emission from
H2CO coincident with the continuum peak,
indicating
warmer gas there. Despite a tentative anti-correlated distri-
bution between C17O and N2H+/H13CO+ on the scale of
0.5 pc in IRDC 18308, a 10(cid:48)(cid:48)
(0.2 pc) oﬀset between CO
and NH2D emission peak, and a tentative detection of H2CO
(2σ emission) in IRDC 18306, the other sources do not have
the above-mentioned features as G28.34 S.
We note that the emission peak of HCO+ (1 → 0) and
H13CO+ (1 → 0) are not strictly co-spatial in any source
(oﬀsets are 5(cid:48)(cid:48) − 10(cid:48)(cid:48)), and this may come from the large
opacity of HCO+. However, H13CO+ show “deﬁciency”
the continuum peak of IRDC 18530, where 13CO is
at
abundant, which is probably due to the dissociative recom-
bination in this environment (See discussion in Section 4.6).

– SiO is a typical shocked gas tracer, and is commonly
associated with an embedded, energetic young outﬂow(s).
We detect SiO (2 → 1) only in G28.34 S, where this line
shows strong emission and broad line wings (Figure A1).
Coincident with the H2O maser in G28.34 S (Wang et al.
2006), its emission may be from outﬂow and thus implies a
protostar is already embedded in this source. However, we
cannot rule out the possibility that the SiO emission may
also come from the bright infrared source which is 40(cid:48)(cid:48) south
to our targeted region, or from G28.34 P1 which is 1(cid:48) to
the north and hosts a jet-like outﬂow (Wang et al. 2011).
Therefore, the spatial origin of SiO is crucial to diagnose
the evolutionary status of G28.34 S, and thus further kinetic
study with higher sensitivity data12 is needed to conﬁrm its
spatial origin.

– Carbon chains/rings are a mysterious group of species
whose gas/grain origin is still not clear. Among the species
we detected, C2H has been predicted by chemical model
as residing in the source center in the early stage, before
transforming into other species (e.g., CO, OH, H2O), and
it can have high abundance in the outer shells even at later
stages (Beuther et al. 2008); the carbon ring c-C3H2, ﬁrst
detected in the cold dark cloud TMC-1 by Matthews &
Irvine (1985), is reported to survive even in a hot region
where NH3 is photon-destroyed (Palau et al. 2014); CH3C2H
is considered as a good probe of temperature for early stages
of star-forming regions (Bergin et al. 1994). We detect the
above-mentioned carbon chains/ring towards the continuum
peak of all our sources, except in IRDC 18530 where only
C2H is observed. However, since these species also show
stronger or roughly the same emission towards the nearby
70 µm bright sources (according to the half maximum
intensity contour), we cannot tell whether these species are
good cold gas tracer or not.

– Sulfur (S-) bearing species also have unknown chem-
istry. Two S-bearing lines, 13CS(2 → 1) and OCS (7 → 6)

12 SiO (6 → 5) line has only 2.5σ detection in our SMA data.

Feng et al.: Are the Infrared Dark Clouds Really Quiescent?

are covered in our observations (except for OCS line in
IRDC 18530). Owing to their high dipole moments, CS iso-
topologues are used as dense gas tracers (e.g., Bronfman
et al. 1996) in both low-mass (e.g., Tafalla et al. 2002) and
high-mass prestellar cores (e.g., Jones et al. 2008), but they
show high depletions in the center of high-mass dense cores
(e.g., Beuther & Henning 2009). OCS forms via surface
chemistry and is the only S-bearing molecules that has actu-
ally been observed on interstellar ices (Palumbo et al. 1997).
Both 13CS and OCS are only detected in G28.34 S with > 4σ
emission, but these emissions are seen to be originated from
the NE bright source, according to their half maximum inten-
sity contours. Therefore, we do not claim their spatial origin
from the cold gas.

In short, G28.34 S appears chemically more evolved than the
other sources in our sample, for the sole detections of H2CO and
OCS, strong emission of HNCO, HCO+ asymmetric line pro-
ﬁle implying signiﬁcant infall, and SiO coinciding with previous
H2O maser detection. All these signatures indicate G28.34 S as
the host of potential protostellar objects.

4. Analysis and Discussion
4.1. Fragmentation
Figure 1 presents the continuum maps of Herschel 70 µm,
APEX 870 µm (ATLASGAL), and SMA 1.1 mm. Because the
COMP+EXT conﬁguration of SMA ﬁlters out some extended
structures, in the following we calculate parameters using data
obtained with the COMP conﬁguration only.

We assume that the dust emission is optically thin, and
that dust is fully coupled with gas with the same temperature.
Therefore, we estimate the mass Mfr and column density Nfr
in the resolved fragments from the SMA continuum maps with
(Hildebrand 1983; Schuller et al. 2009):

Mfr =

The averaged column density of the whole clump (in the 40(cid:48)(cid:48) ×

Nc =

where D is the source kinematic distance (from the sun), S1.1mm
is the total continuum ﬂux density at 1.1 mm (measured from
each fragment after 2-D Gaussian ﬁt13, in units of Jy); I1.1mm is
the speciﬁc intensity for the continuum peak of each fragment
(in Jy beam−1); I0.87mm is the averaged speciﬁc intensity in the
40(cid:48)(cid:48) × 40(cid:48)(cid:48) region (in Jy beam−1); R is the isothermal gas to dust
mass ratio (taken to be 150, from Draine 2011), B1.1mm(TSMA)
and B0.87mm(TATLAS) are the Planck functions for a dust temper-
ature TSMA or TATLAS; ΩSMA and ΩATLAS are the solid angles of
the SMA and ATLASGAL beam (in rad2); κ1.1mm = 1.0 cm2g−1
and κ0.87mm = 1.8 cm2g−1 are the dust absorption coeﬃcients at
1.1 mm and 870 µm (assuming a model of agglomerated grains
with thick ice mantles for densities 105–106 cm−3, extrapolated
13 We ﬁt the 2-D Gaussian structure with CASA, http://casa.nrao.edu

from Ossenkopf & Henning 1994). µ is the mean molecular
weight of the ISM, which is assumed to be 2.33; and mH is the
mass of an hydrogen atom (1.67× 10−24 g).

As described in Table 4.I, the sizes of fragments (from
2-D Gaussian ﬁtting) are 2–4 times larger than the SMA beam
size on small scales. On larger scales, the sizes of ﬁlamen-
tary structures (projected area with > 10σ emission) seem
to be more extended than the primary beam of ATLASGAL
(θALTLASGAL = 18(cid:48)(cid:48)). Therefore, we take the ﬁlling factors as
unity in both spatial scales.

First, we compare the gas concentrations on diﬀerent spa-
tial scales. Following Kirk et al. (2006), assuming Bonner-Ebert
(BE) spheres for both large-scale clumps and small-scale cores,
the gas concentration can be estimated in terms of observable
parameters as,

ConATLAS = 1− 1.44ΩATLAS
ConSMA = 1− 1.44ΩSMAS1.1mm
A1.1mmI1.1mm

I0.87mm

S0.87mm
A0.87mm

(4)

(5)

Where A1.1mm is the size of each small-scale fragment,
derived from 2-D Gaussian ﬁts (which is almost the same
size as the area within the 5σ continuum contour). Since
ATLASGAL ﬁlaments are not suitable to ﬁt with a 2-D
Gaussian, we measure the total ﬂux per unit projection size
on each ATLASGAL clumps (S0.87mm/A0.87mm) with the
following approach: Following Wang et al. (2015), we extract
a ﬂux intensity proﬁle from a cut perpendicular to the ﬁlament
elongated direction, which is centered on the mapping center of
the 30 m observations14. Then we measure the FWHM width
of the ﬁlament locally around our source. For each ﬁlament,
we set three rectangles along the ﬁlamentary orientation. These
rectangles all have the same centers as the previous cut and
the same width as the local FWHM width. The length of the
rectangles along the ﬁlament are one, two, and three times of the
FWHM width. Then, we measure the total ﬂux and projection
size within each rectangles and derive the mean.

We ﬁnd that the gas concentration (listed in Table 4) on
large scales (ConATLAS ∼ 0.6) is lower than that in the small-
scale fragments (ConSMA ∼ 0.8). Moreover, the large-scale
concentration is on the verge of requiring additional non-thermal
support mechanism (critical value of BE sphere as 0.72 from

Second, assuming that all small-scale fragments and large-
scale cloud clumps are spherically symmetric, we then estimate
the gas volume number density of each fragment nfr from θSMA
(in unit of rad), and the averaged gas volume number density nc
of the whole clump on larger scales from θALTLASGAL (in unit of

ferent radii, so the ﬂux intensity proﬁle is the ﬁrst order estimate instead
of the density proﬁle in Wang et al. (2015).

We assume that the core-scale structures (size of ∼0.1 pc)
seen in the SMA-COMP conﬁguration result from the fragmen-
tation from the pc-scale clumps. If fragmentation is governed
by the thermal Jeans instabilities, the thermal Jeans length λth−J
and mass Mth−J of the whole clump can be estimated from the
averaged density and temperature in this clump,

– Turbulent Jeans fragmentation:

Since thermal Jeans fragmentation describes the fragmen-
tation processes when the internal pressure is dominated
by the thermal motion, the aforementioned “discrepency”
indicates that non-thermal motions, such as turbulence may
play an important role in fragmentation (e.g.,Wang et al.
2011, 2014).

To investigate whether non-thermal pressure provides extra
kinetic energy against the gravitational energy of the frag-
ments, we need to measure the velocity dispersion over the
whole clump, which can be derived from the linewidth of
the dense gas tracer(s). Collated in Table A1, linewidths of
all the species are on average 2–3 kms−1. H13CO+ (1 → 0)
has a high critical density (ncrit > 104 cm−3, Bergin & Tafalla
2007; Csengeri et al. 2011; Shirley 2015), low Eu/kB (4 K),
and no hyperﬁne multiplet. Its velocity dispersion is not
impacted by Galactic spiral arms (e.g., the line proﬁles of
CO, C18O, and C17O along the line of sight are contribu-
tions from various Galactic arms, see Beuther & Sridharan
2007), and it has a symmetric Gaussian proﬁle. Therefore,
√
we use this line to measure the observed velocity dispersion
in the line of sight σobs = ∆υ/
(8ln2). Here, we assume that
the averaged gas temperature in the whole clump is T30m =
√
TATLAS. Comparing σobs with the thermally broadened ve-
locity dispersion of H13CO+ σth =
8ln2kBT30m/(30mH),
we estimate the non-thermally broadened velocity dispersion
th and list them in Table 4.II. Within the
σNth =
gas temperature T30m range of 12–18 K, we ﬁnd that σobs
is dominated by non-thermal motions throughout the whole
source clump (size of ∼ 105 AU). Therefore, assuming that
turbulence dominates the non-thermal motion, we replace cs
with σobs in Eqs. 8 and 9 and list the turbulent Jeans length
λNth−J and mass MNth−J in Table 4.II.

temperatures, and may increase the fragmentation scale.
Both λNth−J and MNth−J are higher than the values observed
with SMA, and so this may be a viable method of support.
Of course it should be noted that, if the turbulence lead to
shocks occurring in the region, the increased density may
lead instead to further fragmentation (Dobbs et al. 2005).
Note that our data is insuﬃcient to isolate multiple velocity
components, given its spectral and spatial resolution. If these
are present, the velocity dispersion, and therefore turbulent
Jeans length/mass, would be overestimated.

and cs = [kBTATLAS/(µmH)]1/2 is the speed of sound at temper-
ature TATLAS.

We assume TSMA = 15 K because of the following reasons:
(1) We did not detect the SMA-targeted lines with low upper
energy levels (Eu/k ∼ 25 K); (2) Low temperatures have been
estimated from other observations in G28.34 S–SABOCA 350
survey (13 K as upper limit, 11(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution, Ragan et al. 2013),
SPIRE 500 µm observations (16 K, 36(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution), and the
rotation temperature of NH3 derived from VLA (13-15 K,
5(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution, private communication with K. Wang); (3) It is
unclear whether protostar has already formed in these sources.
Dust and gas may either have higher temperature in the envelope
region (i.e., structures probed by ATLASGAL, SABOCA, and
SPIRE 500 µm) than at the SMA-probed center because of
UV-shielding; or, the envelope can be colder than the central
core if the protostar has been formed (i.e., G28.34 S). In case
of either situation, we give the estimates of the large-scale
ATLASGAL clumps at ad hoc temperatures 12 K, 15 K and
18 K.

As shown in Table 4, the volume densities in the SMA
fragments are at least ten times higher than the averaged volume
densities found in the ATLASGAL clumps. Moreover, the aver-
age projected separation in-between fragments (0.07–0.24 pc) is
comparable to the predicted thermal Jeans length of the whole
clump (0.07–0.18 pc), at a temperature of TATLASGAL > 12K
and TSMA ∼ 15K. However, the fragment masses are signiﬁ-
cantly (more than four times) higher than the predicted thermal
Jeans masses of the whole clumps, even without accounting

Table 4: Parameters of the fragments and estimates from hypotheses of fragmentation. Table I lists the parameters measured from
SMA observations at 1.1 mm: the coordinates, speciﬁc intensity at continuum peak, total ﬂux density and source size within 5σ rms
continuum emission region. H2 column density and the average volume density at the continuum peak are estimated at 15 K. Table
II lists the averaged linewidth of H13CO+ (1 → 0) in a 40(cid:48)(cid:48)×40(cid:48)(cid:48) region (from [20(cid:48)(cid:48), 20(cid:48)(cid:48)] to [-20(cid:48)(cid:48), -20(cid:48)(cid:48)] oﬀset, corresponding to
∼ 1.5× 105 AU) obtained from 30 m observations. The velocity dispersion in each source along with the thermal and non-thermal
components, the thermal and turbulent Jeans mass and length, and the extreme case of cylindrical fragmentation are estimated at 5
K, 10 K, and 15 K.

The large-scale ﬁlamentary gas distribution at 870 µm
and the small-scale SMA fragments in G28.34 S and
IRDC 18308 are well aligned with roughly the same pro-
jected separation (Figure 1). Similar feature has been re-
ported in other HMSFRs, e.g., G28.34 S P1 (Zhang et al.
2009; Wang et al. 2011), G11.11-0.12 (Wang et al. 2014),
and NGC 7538 S (Feng et al. submitted). Simulations (e.g,
Chandrasekhar & Fermi 1953; Nagasawa 1987; Bastien et al.
1991; Inutsuka & Miyama 1992; Fischera & Martin 2012)
also predicted that isothermal, “cylindrical” gas collapses
into a chain of fragments, with equal spatial separation λcl
along the ﬁlament under self gravity, and then the frag-
ments grow due to “varicose” or “sausage” ﬂuid instabil-

ity (Jackson et al. 2010). Without magnetic ﬁelds, the crit-
ical linear mass density (M/l)crit represents the linear mass
over which self-gravity overcomes the internal thermal and
non-thermal pressure. The critical separation λcl and critical
mass of fragment Mcl in the large-scale clump were orig-
inally given in Chandrasekhar & Fermi (1953); Nagasawa
(1987). In the case that the thermal motions are not suﬃ-
cient to be against gravitational energy, we replace the sound
speed with the velocity dispersion σobs, and have (Fiege &

In Table 4.II, we list the critical mass and separation of
each source estimated from cylindrical fragmentation. Non-
thermal motions, such as turbulence in this special case, can
provide support against gravitational collapse of the mass
up to ∼ 800M(cid:12). In particular, the hypothesis of cylindrical
fragmentation predicts high linear mass densities for both
G28.34 S (788M(cid:12)pc−1) and IRDC 18308 (365M(cid:12)pc−1),
which are similar to that of IRDC G11.11-0.12 found in
Kainulainen et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2014). These
predictions are upper limits, because possible unresolved
velocity components may lead to an overestimation of the
H13CO+ velocity dispersion from the 30 m observations (at
the angular resolution of 30(cid:48)(cid:48)).

To compare the predicted upper limit with the values from
observations, we also measure the linear mass of the above
ATLASGAL ﬁlamentary clumps (M/l)ATLAS from their dust
emission maps16 at the angular resolution of 18(cid:48)(cid:48). We ﬁnd
that if G28.34 S is warmer than 18 K (855 ± 244M(cid:12)pc−1)
and IRDC 18308 is warmer than 15 K (265 ± 23M(cid:12)pc−1,
Table 4.II), the predicted upper limits are higher than the
observed linear mass of the ATLASGAL sources. If mag-
netic ﬁeld were taken into account, the predicted linear mass
would be even higher (e.g, Kirk et al. 2015). That is to say,
both clumps are likely stable against cylindrical fragmenta-
tion.

– Other possibilities:

We do not ﬁnd obvious velocity gradients in our sources,
so the rotation energy is negligible comparing to the gravi-
tational energy17. Nevertheless, other possibilities, besides
non-thermal motions, may also lead to a “mass/separation
discrepancy” between the observations and thermal Jeans
predications, where the projected separation in-between
fragments are comparable to the Jeans length but
the
observed mass is higher than the Jeans mass.

(1) Magnetic ﬁelds may suppress fragmentation (e.g.,
Commerc¸on et al. 2011).
(2) An inhomogeneous density proﬁle
in the core may
alter
recent
numerical simulations by Girichidis et al. (2011) show that
less fragmentation occurs in steeper initial density proﬁles,

its fragmentation properties. For example,

16 Since a 2-D Gaussian is not suitable to model a ﬁlamentary struc-
ture, we use the same algorithm as measuring the total ﬂux per unit
projection size–to measure the linear masses in rectangles, which are
centered on the mapping center of 30 m observations and individually
have length one, two, three times of the local FWHM width; and derive
the mean.
17 Even if the velocity distribution of our source is biased by our ﬁeld
of view, rotation energy is in general not comparable to the gravitational
energy (Goodman et al. 1993; Bihr et al. 2015)

16

and the ﬁnal fragments are more massive than from a ﬂat
initial density proﬁle (by a factor of up to 20 in the extreme
case).
(3) The “precise” Jeans length is tricky to quantify. Since
the sensitivity of the SMA observations does not detect
lower mass fragments, the separation between the fragments
is an upper limit of the Jeans length. Conversely, the
projection of a 3-D distribution onto the the plane of the
sky reduces the observed fragment separation, which makes
the measured length a lower limit of the Jeans length. It
is diﬃcult to assess quantitatively how these two factors
aﬀect the measured separation between dust peaks. These
uncertainties make the Jeans length comparison tricky.
(4) As the density increases, the local Jeans mass decreases,
cores can further fragment. Therefore, based on the current
data, we cannot rule out
the possibility of unresolved
internal sub-fragments (condensations).

In short, the mass of the initial fragments resolved from
1.1 mm SMA observation are already high (on average
> 10M(cid:12)). Thermal energy alone cannot compete against the
self-gravity of these fragments, though, the combination of
thermal and non-thermal motions can provide suﬃcient energy
in opposing the further fragmentation. Moreover, a steep initial
density proﬁle of the whole clump and the magnetic ﬁeld may
also increase the upper limit of the ﬁnal fragment mass. With
the current data, it is diﬃcult to measure the precise Jeans length
and resolve internal sub-structures in the fragments. Therefore,
we cannot diﬀerentiate between the above scenarios.

4.2. Infall motion
We ﬁnd that the line proﬁles of HCO+ (1 → 0), which is likely
optically thick, shows an asymmetric non-Gaussian proﬁle, es-
pecially in G28.34 S. As contrast, H13CO+ (1 → 0), which
is optically thin, shows a fairly symmetric proﬁle (Figure 4).
Following Mardones et al. (1997), we measure the normalized
velocity diﬀerence between the two lines δVH13CO+ = (VHCO+ −
VH13CO+)/∆υH13CO+ in each source. Except for IRDC 18308,
δVH13CO+ in other sources are signiﬁcant (Table 7)18, indicative
of violent dynamics. In particular, line proﬁle of HCO+ (1 → 0)
in G28.34 S shows double intensity peaks of blue- and red-
shifted gas, indicating a potential infall motion, with an infall
speed ∼ 0.84km s−1 (derived by using Eq. 9 of Myers et al.
1996). Nevertheless, note that the peak intensity of the red-
shifted gas is only 0.1 as strong as that of the blue-shifted gas, we
cannot rule out the possibility that double intensity peaks comes
from multiple velocity components. If that is the case, the high-
velocity (red-shifted) gas of H13CO+ (1 → 0) may be too weak
to the observation sensitivity.

4.3. Molecular column density and abundance estimates
We did not detect emissions of the higher-J molecular transi-
tions in the fragments from the SMA observations. However, the
lower-J transitions of the dense gas tracers are detected in the
extended structures in the 30 m line survey. This indicates that
our sources are in the cold, young phase. To probe the chemi-

old of “signiﬁcance” as 5 times of the uncertainty of δVH13CO+.

Feng et al.: Are the Infrared Dark Clouds Really Quiescent?

(1)
In the cold gas environment with densities of
104–105 cm−3, species with high critical densities are
sub-thermally excited (e.g., at 10 K, the critical density
of N2H+ (J = 1 → 0) is ∼ 6 × 104 cm−3, and that of
HCN (J = 1 → 0) is ∼ 5 × 105 cm−3, Shirley 2015), so
their Tex is lower than the typical kinetic temperatures of
IRDCs (e.g., Sridharan et al. 2005; Vasyunina et al. 2011;
Fontani et al. 2012). This feature is common in both high-
mass and low-mass dark clouds (e.g., Caselli et al. 2002b;
Crapsi et al. 2005; Miettinen et al. 2011; Fontani et al. 2012).

(2) To increase the signal-to-noise ratio for the weak emis-
sion, we extract the average spectra from the 40(cid:48)(cid:48)×40(cid:48)(cid:48) re-
gion, but the gas is not homogeneous as assumed. For
one thing, H13CN is deﬁcient at
the continuum peak
IRDC 18530 and IRDC 18308 (Figure 3). For an-
of
other, HCN (J = 1 → 0) has an anomalous line proﬁle in
IRDC 18306 (the “HFS” component with the strongest
relative intensity shows weaker emission than the others).
This “anomalousness” has also been noted by Afonso et al.
(1998) and was explained as the inconsistency intensity
ratios between multiplets of HCN, i.e., individual hyperﬁne
line may be enhanced or suppressed in dark clouds because
of non-LTE (Loughnane et al. 2012). Therefore, the low Tex
we derived here are the averaged excitation temperatures
from the not perfectly ﬁtted spectrum (Figure 5.III).

(3) “HFS” method is applicable when the source is in ideal
LTE (assumption 1 - 3 in Appendix A) and multiplets are
resolved (assumption 4 ). However,
in our observations
HCN and H13CN may be non-LTE, and seven multiplet lines
of N2H+ are blended into three Gaussian peaks at a velocity
resolution of ∼ 0.641 kms−1 (Figure 5.A). Therefore, “HFS”
method only gives the rough level of the Tex.

(4) Another factor which would aﬀect the Tex estimation
is the ﬁlling factor f, which is estimated by assuming that
the species emission extent is equal to the area within
the contour of half maximum integrated-intensity (Eq.
A.1–A.3). In most cases, the emission extends over the
30 m primary beam, so f ∼ 1. For species whose equivalent
distribution diameter is smaller than the primary beam could
have a f (cid:28) 1 (e.g. H13CN in IRDC 18306 and IRDC 18308
have f < 0.5). Moreover, the asymmetric spatial distribution
of emission would also bring uncertainty (i.e., the equivalent
distribution diameter depends on the velocity range we
integrate and the edge of the emission extent we deﬁne). On
average, Tex is underestimated for f ∼ 1, and will increase
by a factor of 1.2-1.5 for f ∼ 0.2.

Following the “CTex” approach introduced by Caselli
et al. (2002c) where N2H+ with Tex ∼ 5K, we assume that
the transitions of each molecule can be described by an
approximately constant Tex. Then we estimate the column
densities of the above species19 with Eq. A.4.

– Molecules without hyperﬁne multiplet

CO isotopologues are important gas tracers because of
their low dipole moments and thermalization near their
critical densities (at 10–20 K, ∼ 103 cm−3 for 13CO (2 → 1),

19 A more precise approach is to use non-LTE radiative transfer code
RADEX. However, without knowing the source structure, it does not
signiﬁcantly improve out results.

cal properties in these gas clumps, we quantify their excitation
conditions and molecular abundances in this section.

4.3.1. Molecular excitation temperatures and column

densities

We calculated the molecular column densities averaged from the
central 40(cid:48)(cid:48)×40(cid:48)(cid:48) region of each source. Since the optical depth
may lead to large uncertainties of certain lines, we use diﬀerent
methods to correct their opacities.
– N2H+, C2H, HCN, and H13CN have multiplets in their
J = 1 → 0 or N = 1 → 0 (C2H) transitions. We use “HFS”
method to ﬁt these transitions (Figure 5) and list their
excitation temperatures Tex in Table 5 (See Appendix A for
details).

From the ﬁts, we found the linewidths of the strongest
components ∆υ of the above species are in the range of
1.7–3.2 kms−1. This is consistent with the linewidth of the
other species (Table A1), indicating non-thermal motions
dominate the velocity dispersion. N2H+ (J = 1 → 0) and
C2H+ (N = 1 → 0) are ﬁtted very well, but the ﬁts for
HCN (J = 1 → 0) and H13CN (J = 1 → 0) show strong
deviations. Most of the Tex we derived from the “HFS” ﬁts
are below 10 K (except for HCN in G28.34 S), which could
be due to multiple reasons:

(cid:9)(cid:24)(cid:25)(cid:15)(cid:20)(cid:76)(cid:78)(cid:16)(cid:84)(cid:13)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:44)(cid:10)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:20)(cid:15)(cid:20)(cid:76)(cid:78)(cid:16)(cid:84)(cid:13)(cid:1)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:23)(cid:44)(cid:10)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:76)(cid:78)(cid:16)(cid:84)(cid:13)(cid:1)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:44)(cid:10)(cid:9)(cid:24)9(cid:15)4(cid:76)(cid:78)(cid:16)(cid:84)(cid:13)(cid:1)0.4(cid:44)(cid:10)Table 5: Tex derived from hyperﬁne ﬁts to N2H+, C2H, HCN and H13CN multiplets in four IRDCs

and their Tex can be taken as the Tkin of the gas.

transitions of

the CO isotopologues

Lower-J
(e.g,
13CO (2 → 1)) may be optically thick, so a precise es-
timation of its Tex needs opacity correction. Assuming that
fractionation (isotopic exchange reaction) of 12C ⇔ 13C and
of 17O ⇔ 16O ⇔ 18O are stable, we correct the optical depth
τ and estimate Tex of CO isotopologue (1 → 0) lines (listed
in Table 6, see Appendix B for details).
For G28.34 S and IRDC 18306, C18O (2 → 1) is opti-
cally thin, according to our optical depth measurements
from C17O (2 → 1) (Table 6). Since we did not observe
C17O (1 → 0) in IRDC 18530, and the intensity of this line
is only ∼ 3σ rms in IRDC 18308, we take the optically thin
C18O (2 → 1) as a standard to estimate the other chemical
parameters afterward.

Tex derived from CO isotopologues are consistent
in
G28.34S (11–14 K), indicating CO is in LTE. This temper-
ature range is also consistent with that derived from VLA
NH3 observations, SABOCA 350 survey, and SPIRE 500 µm
observations (mentioned in Section 4.1). Most of the other
lines without hyperﬁne multiplets (except for SiO (2 → 1))
have low critical density, we assume they are coupled with
dust and thermalized at Tgas = Tdust = Tkin ∼ Tex,CO. The
column densities of these species can be derived according
to Appendix C. In particularly, column densities of species
which we detected their rare isotopologue lines (HCO+,
HNC, and 13CO) are derived after opacity corrections.

Molecular column densities estimated using the above ap-
proaches are listed in Tables A3I and A4I.

4.3.2. H2 column density estimates
H2 column density at clump-scale can be estimated from Eq. 3.
At the temperature of TATLAS = Tex,CO ∼ 10K, average H2 col-
umn density measured from the ATLASGAL in the 40(cid:48)(cid:48) × 40(cid:48)(cid:48)
region is on the order of 1023 cm−2 (1gcm−2, Table 7), which is
consistent with the threshold for high-mass star-forming clouds
proposed by Krumholz & McKee (2008).

4.3.3. Molecular abundance with respect to H2
APEX has a comparable beam size (18(cid:48)(cid:48)) as the IRAM 30 m
at 1 mm (12(cid:48)(cid:48)) and 3 mm (30(cid:48)(cid:48)) . Therefore, assuming that the
averaged continuum speciﬁc intensity at 18(cid:48)(cid:48)angular resolution
(from APEX) is comparable to that at 12–30(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution (from
the 30 m), averaged molecular abundances with respect to H2

18

at the clump scale (within 40(cid:48)(cid:48) × 40(cid:48)(cid:48) region) can be estimated
(Tables A3II and A4II). One needs to keep in mind that the
diﬀerence of the beam size will lead to the overestimation of the
1 mm molecular abundance and underestimation of the 3 mm
molecular abundance by a factor of 2–3, because H2 column
density (Eq. 3) is under- (over-) estimated at 1 mm (3 mm).

The column densities of N2H+, C2H, HCN, and H13CN
are estimated with the respect Tex estimated from their “HFS”
ﬁttings. Since Tex is diﬀerent from that of the dust temper-
ature used to derive the H2 column density, it introduces a
large uncertainty for the column density estimates. Previous
molecular spectral line observations towards several IRDCs
have shown the typical range of Tkin = 10–20 K (e.g., Carey
et al. 1998; Teyssier et al. 2002; Sridharan et al. 2005; Pillai
et al. 2006; Sakai et al. 2008; Devine et al. 2011; Ragan et al.
2011; Zhang & Wang 2011). In addition, spectral energy
distributions of clumps within “quiescent” IRDCs indicate a
range of dust temperature Tdust = 10–30 K (e.g., Henning et al.
2010; Rathborne et al. 2010). Therefore, we also estimate the
column densities and abundances of N2H+, C2H, HCN, and
H13CN at the same Tkin ∼ Tex,CO as the other species, listed in
Tables A3. Comparison between the values at these two sets
of temperatures indicates that the molecular abundances are
sensitive to the temperatures in the 5–15 K regime, and 5 K
diﬀerence in temperature brings the abundance uncertainty
to the order of 1–2 magnitudes. In the following analysis, we
use the abundances at ∼ Tex,CO to estimate the other chemical
parameters.

4.4. Chemical similarity and diversity of our sample

comparing to other HMSCs

On the clump-core scale (∼0.8 pc), most strong emission
lines detected by the 30 m observations are from N-bearing
species, which show anti-correlation spatial distribution with
CO isotopologues in G28.34 S and IRDC 18308. Emissions
from shock tracers (e.g., SiO in G28.34 S and HNCO), infall
tracers (e.g., HCO+ and HCN), and the detection of carbon ring
(e.g., c-C3H2) indicate that these cold, young clouds are not
completely “quiescent”.

Although the above features are qualitatively similar to the
low-mass prestellar objects (LMPO) (typical scale of ∼0.02
pc, Ohishi et al. 1992; Jørgensen et al. 2004; Tafalla et al.
2006), quantitative comparison between HMSCs and LMPOs
requires observations at the same spatial scale. We compare the
molecular abundances in our sources with previous spectral line
studies in other HMSCs (e.g., Vasyunina et al. 2009; Gerner
et al. 2014). On one hand, all species in our sources have on

average lower abundances than the aforementioned studies,
20 and the possibly overestimated
probably due to our lower Tkin
H2 column density (Section 4.3.3). Therefore, a more precise
estimation of the molecular abundance requires a more reliable
temperature measurement. On the other hand, species have
higher abundance in G28.34 S than the others in our sample,
indicating again it is a chemically more evolved source.

The typical dense gas tracers HCN and HNC are a pair
of isomers, whose abundance ratio is strongly temperature
dependent. It has been reported that
the HCN/HNC ratio
decreases with the increasing temperature, ranging from ≤ 1 in
the low-mass prestellar cores (e.g., Ohishi et al. 1992; Jørgensen
et al. 2004; Tafalla et al. 2006; Sarrasin et al. 2010) to the order
of unity in dark clouds (e.g., Hirota et al. 1998; Vasyunina et al.
2011), then above 10 in high-mass protostellar objects (e.g.,
Blake et al. 1987; Helmich & van Dishoeck 1997), and reaching
several tens in warm cores (e.g., Orion GMC, Goldsmith et al.
1986; Schilke et al. 1992). In our sources, the HCN/HNC ratio
is almost unity in G28.34 S and IRDC 18530 (Table 7), which
is consistent with the value in dark clouds. If we compare the
abundance ration in our study to the statistically criteria value
given by Jin et al. (2015), IRDC 18530 is likely a “quiescent”
IRDC, G28.34S is more “active”.

4.5. CO depletion

The sublimation temperature of CO is around 20 K (Caselli
et al. 1999; Fontani et al. 2006; Aikawa et al. 2008), so most
CO is frozen out (depleted) onto the grains in the center of

20 The molecular abundances estimated in our study is on average 1
magnitude lower than the IRDC large sample study by Gerner et al.
(2014). However, if we assume a higher Tkin ∼ 15 K as the aforemen-
tioned paper did, the molecular abundances are comparable.

cold cloud. In contrast, N-bearing species are more resilient
to depletion (e.g., Bergin et al. 2002; Caselli et al. 2002c;
Jørgensen et al. 2004). Moreover, since CO destroys N2H+
and decreases deuterium fraction, the anti-correlated spatial
distribution between N2H+/NH2D and CO in G28.34 S and
IRDC 18308 indicates strong depletion of CO (Figure 3).

The depletion factor is deﬁned as the ratio between the
expected abundance of a species XE
α and the observed abun-
dance of that species XO
α/XO
α .
We measure the CO depletion factor averaged in the 40(cid:48)(cid:48) × 40(cid:48)(cid:48)
region from J = 2 → 1 lines of C17O, C18O, and 13CO (with
optical depth correction) and list them in Table 7. Depletion
factors derived from C17O and C18O are consistent in each
IRDC (with a mean as 30). However, depletion factors derived
from 13CO are lower than from its rare isotopologues by a
factor of 2 in IRDC 18530 and IRDC 18306, indicating the
“canonical” ratio between isotopes may have large uncertainties
in both sources. One possibility is fractionation of 12C ⇔ 13C
and of 17O ⇔ 16O ⇔ 18O in the low temperature environment
(< 10 K in both souces). Nevertheless, CO seems to be heavily
depleted in our sample, with a depletion factor in the range of
14–50 at < 15 K and n ∼ 105 cm−3, which is consistent with
the range given by Fontani et al. (2012) from a large sample
study. In particular, depletion of ∼ 14 in G28.34S is consistent
with that in the nearby source G28.34 S P1 (Zhang et al. 2009).
Comparing with G28.34 S and IRDC 18308, IRDC 18530 and
IRDC 18306 have higher CO depletion factors on scales of
0.8 pc, but they do not show signiﬁcant anti-correlation distri-
bution between CO and N2H+/NH2D at the spatial resolution
of 0.2–0.6 pc. Therefore, high depletion of CO may happen on
smaller scales (< 0.2 pc), and to conﬁrm this possibility requires
higher resolution maps.

Feng et al.: Are the Infrared Dark Clouds Really Quiescent?

4.6. Ionization
The ionization fraction x(e) in the early stage of star formation
is an important indicator of the cosmic ray impact in the dense,
dark clouds. Based on the assumption that gas is quasi-neutral,
x(e) can be simply estimated by summing up the abundance
of all the molecular ions (e.g., Caselli et al. 2002c; Miettinen
et al. 2009). Therefore, the ionization fraction in our sources is
dominated by the abundance of N2H+, and on average, it is at a
lower limit of 10−8.

In addition, based on the assumption of chemical equilib-
rium, x(e) in dense molecular clouds can also be derived from
ion-neutral reaction. Using the same method as described in
Miettinen et al. (2011) and the chemical network in their Table
8, we only consider the reactions between N2H+, HCO+, and
CO (the abundance is derived from C18O without any fractional
reactions). The lower limit of x(e) can be derived as (see also Qi
et al. 2003):

HCO+ + e β11→ CO + H,

(15)

N2H+ + CO

k11→ HCO+ + N2
x(e) ≥ k15X(N2H+)X(CO)
β11X(HCO+)

(16)
(17)
where the rate coeﬃcients β11 = 2.4 × 10−7( Tkin
300 K )−0.69 and
k15 = 8.8 × 10−10cm3s−1 are adopted from UMIST database
(Woodall et al. 2007).

From Table 7, we found that the lower limit of ionization
rate is ∼ 10−7. This method has some assumptions, e.g.,
CO depletion and fractional reaction are not considered, as
discussed in Caselli et al. (1998); Lintott & Rawlings (2006);
Miettinen et al. (2011). Nevertheless,
these more precise,
model-based estimations are consistent with those reported in
HMSCs (e.g., Williams et al. 1998; Bergin et al. 1999; Chen
et al. 2010; Miettinen et al. 2011) and the modeling result in
Gerner et al. (2014). Moreover, lower limit of ionization rate
in our large-scale (∼0.8 pc) HMSC envelopes is higher than
the model-predicted values in the low-mass prestellar objects
center (e.g., > 10−9, Caselli et al. 2002c). This is reasonable
because of larger cosmic ray ionization rates in the envelope of
HMSCs than in the inner region of their low-mass counterparts.
It is also possible that these HMSCs are in a much more active
environment than low-mass prestellar cores, and hence they are
aﬀected by much more radiation of any kind.

In addition, as mentioned in Section 3.2.2, H13CO+ is
“deﬁcient” in regions where 13CO is abundant in IRDC 18530.
This may be explained by Eq. 15–16 that rate coeﬃcient β11 is
enhanced in this source.

5. Conclusions
To investigate the initial conditions of high-mass star forma-
tion, we carried out several observations with the SMA and
IRAM 30 m. In this paper, we study the dynamic and chemical
properties of four IRDCs (G28.34S, IRDC 18530, IRDC 18306,
and IRDC 18308), which exhibit strong (sub)mm continuum
emission toward 70 µm extinction features. At diﬀerent spatial
resolutions and wavelengths, this small sample study of IRDCs
illustrates that the cold (T < 15 K), dense (∼ 105 cm−3) high

20

mass star forming regions are not completely quiescent.

1. At an angular resolution of 2(cid:48)(cid:48) (∼ 104 AU at an average
distance of 4 kpc), the 1.1 mm SMA observations resolve
each source into several fragments. The average separation
in between the fragments is 0.07–0.24 pc, comparable to
the Jeans length. However, the mass of each fragment is on
average > 10M(cid:12), exceeding the thermal Jeans mass of the
whole clump by a factor of up to 60, indicating that thermal
pressure alone does not dominate the fragmentation process.

2. In the 8 GHz SMA observational band at 1.1 mm,
higher-J transitions (including dense gas tracers such
as H13CO+ (2 → 1)) are not detected, implying our sources
are in the cold and young evolutionary status when lines
with Eu/kB > 20 K may not be excited. However, our line
survey at 1 mm/3 mm shows a number of emission from
lower-J transitions. In particular, a > 5σ rms detection of
SiO (2 → 1) with broad line wings in G28.34 S may be
the signature of a potential protostellar object, and the
asymmetric HCO+ line proﬁle in this source traces potential
infall motion, with a speed of ∼ 0.84 kms−1.

3. Linewidths of all the 30 m detected lines are on average
2–3 kms−1. Using the H13CO+ (1 → 0) line, we calculate the
velocity dispersion components and the critical mass based
on a non-thermal fragmentation scenario. Non-thermal
motions may provide suﬃcient extra support to increase the
scale of the fragmentation, making it possible to support
fragments up to several hundreds of M(cid:12) against gravity.
Alternative explanations may include magnetic ﬁelds and
steep core density proﬁles. The mass of the well-aligned
fragments in ﬁlament G28.34 S and IRDC 18308 is also in
rough agreement with the scenario of “cylindrical fragmen-
tation”.

4. N2H+ (J = 1 → 0), C2H (N = 1 → 0), HCN (J = 1 → 0), and
H13CN (J = 1 → 0) have multiplets in our 30 m data. Using a
hyperﬁne multiplet ﬁt program, we estimate their excitation
temperature (on average 5–8 K) and conclude that they are
sub-thermally excited. The excitation temperatures of the
CO isotopologues suggest that the sources are in the very
early cold phase (∼ 10 K).

5. Our

large-scale high-mass clumps exhibit qualitatively
similar chemical features as low-mass prestellar cores on
small scales, for a large number of N-bearing species, and
the existence of carbon rings and molecular ions. Moreover,
G28.34 S and IRDC 18308 show anti-correlated spatial
distributions between N2H+/NH2D and CO on scale of
0.5 pc. We calculate the molecular abundances, HCN/HNC
ratio, CO depletion factor and ionization fraction, and ﬁnd
that G28.34 S is slightly more chemically evolved than the
other sources in our sample.

6. Large-scale line surveys measures the chemical features of
the high-mass clumps hosting HMSCs, but are not suﬃcient
to probe the chemical complexity of the fragments them-
selves. The above observations reveal non-thermal motions
which dominate the fragmentation process from the dark
cloud to the high-mass cores. However, without line de-
tection, we do not know the dynamics within these cores.

Further studies are expected to uncover the chemical and dy-
namic features within the densest fragments of IRDCs.

Appendix A: Molecular column density based on

“HFS” ﬁt

“HFS” method is based on the CLASS software package. In the ﬁt model, the
relative intensities with respect to the reference line (we set it as the strongest
one) are converted from the (cid:96)(300K) value in the “Splatalogue” database.

Four assumptions are made in the “HFS” ﬁt for one species:

1 All the components of the multiplet have the same excitation temperature.
2 The lines and their optical depths have Gaussian proﬁles.
3 All the multiplets have the same linewidth.
4 The multiplet components do not overlap.

One important parameter is the beam ﬁlling factor f. Despite that distri-
bution of most species are much more extended than the 30 m primary beam,
emission extent of some species (e.g., H13CN in IRDC 18306 and IRDC 18308)
are smaller than the beam. To estimate the ﬁlling factor (on the ﬁrst order), we
deﬁne an equivalent angular diameter of the emission extent θmol as (Wu et al.
2010),

θmol = 2(

A1/2
π

− θ30m
4

)1/2

(rad)

(A.1)

where A1/2 is molecular extent within the contour of half maximum integrated-
intensity, θ30m is the primary beam of 30 m at the molecular rest frequency.

With the beam ﬁlling factor f = θ2

A = f [Jν(Tex)− Jν(Tbg)]

30m), background radiation
temperature Tbg (assumed to be 2.7 K) and the intensity in unit of temperature
Jν(T) = (hν/kB)/[exp(hν/kBT)− 1], this method deﬁnes an eﬀective intensity A
as:
(A.2)
The output parameters are: Vlsr, the optical depth τ0, the linewidth ∆υ, and
the value of eﬀective intensity impacted by the line optical depth Aτ0 of the
reference line. Therefore, with the light speed c, the Planck constant h and a
constant factor η = 2.7964× 10−16 derived from Pickett et al. (1998), the excita-
tion temperature of the multiplet Tex and the molecular column density NT,α at
the frequency ν (in Hz) are given as:

Appendix B: Opacities and excitation temperatures

of CO isotopologue lines

13CO (2 → 1), C18O (2 → 1), and C17O (2 → 1) are all detected in our data.
To estimate their excitation temperatures, we need to know their optical depth.
Assuming that fractionation (isotopic exchange reaction) of 12C ⇔ 13C and of
17O ⇔ 16O ⇔ 18O are stable, we can estimate the optical depth at line center
of a given transition τα,0 by measuring the ratio between main beam brightness
temperature of the main line Tmb, α,0 and its isotopologue Tmb, β,0, (Myers et al.
1983).

1− exp(−τα,0/(cid:60)β/α)

1− exp(−τα,0)

(B.1)
Here (cid:60)β/α is the intrinsic abundance of the main isotope (e.g., 12C) compared
to its rare isotope (e.g., 13C) in the ISM (e.g., Wilson & Rood 1994; Chin et al.
1996).

≈ Tmb, β,0
Tmb, α,0

Since the line proﬁles of CO isotopologues in our sample are contribu-
tions from various Galactic arms (Beuther & Sridharan 2007), we use a multi-
Gaussian proﬁle to ﬁt their Tmb. Then, assuming that C17O (2 → 1) is optically
thin and that all the lines are in LTE, we use Eq. B.1 and the “canonical” ra-
tio between isotopes (the following Eq. B.3-B.5, Frerking et al. 1982; Wilson &
Rood 1994; Giannetti et al. 2014) to correct the optical depth of 13CO (2 → 1)
and C18O (2 → 1).

Subsequently, using Eq. B.6, we estimate Tex of each CO isotopologue, and

list them in Table 6:

Appendix C: Molecular column densities for

species without hyperﬁne multiplets

Consistent Tex of CO isotopologues (Table 6) indicates they are in LTE. Since
most of the other lines without hyperﬁne multiples (except for SiO (2 → 1))
have low critical density, we assume they are coupled with dust and thermalized
at Tgas = Tdust = Tkin ∼ Tex,CO. The column densities of these species can be
derived as

Assuming that the observed emission homogeneously distributes in the primary
beam of 30 m, the integration of measured main beam brightness temperature
Tmb(υ)dυ can be substituted for the last term in the
within the velocity range
above equation:

(1) For species with neither hyperﬁne multiplet nor rare isotopologue, we assume
they are optically thin, therefore,
(2) HCO+, HNC, and 13CO: 13CO (2 → 1) is optically thick in at least 2
of our sources when measured with C17O (2 → 1), and the other lines may
have the same issue. As we have the rare isotopologues of HCO+ (1 → 0) and
HNC (1 → 0) in our data, we use Eq. B.1 to obtain their optical depths and
correct their column densities, by assuming that both H13CO+ (1 → 0) and
HN13C (1 → 0) are optically thin.

In sources where emission of species ≤ 3σ rms, we give their column den-

sity upper limit by assuming f is unity.

*. Hyperﬁne multiplet is ﬁtted using 7 components, which are not resolvable in our data, so we label the three strongest hyperﬁne lines.

1 → 0) (black histograms) from each IRDC, with the ﬁt parameters on the right upper corner. The transitions of multiplets are
labelled in the panels of G28.34 S (with the strongest line in red).

Feng et al.: Are the Infrared Dark Clouds Really Quiescent?

Fig. A1: Line proﬁles of identiﬁed species toward each IRDC, ordered as groups described in Section 3.2.2. The green line is from
single Gaussian ﬁt. “**” denote the species with hyperﬁne multiplets, whose “HFS” ﬁts are plotted in Figure 5. Proﬁles in blue
denote the lines we detect from the “extra band”, where the rms are higher than the others due to less observation time.
