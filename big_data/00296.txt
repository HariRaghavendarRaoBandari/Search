In this Letter we have derived the Jeans length in the context of the Kaniadakis statistics. We
have compared this result with the Jeans length obtained in the non-extensive Tsallis statistics
and discussed the main diﬀerences between these two models. We have also obtained the κ-sound
velocity. Finally, we have applied the results obtained here to analyze an astrophysical system.

Keywords: Jeans’ criterion; non-gaussian statistics

The dynamical stability of a self-gravitating system
usually can be described by the Jeans criterion of grav-
itational instability. The so-called Jeans’s length [1] is
given by

λJ =s πkBT

µmH Gρ0

,

(1)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the tempera-
ture, µ is the mean molecular weight, mH is the atomic
mass of hydrogen, G is the gravitational constant and ρ0
is the equilibrium mass density. The critical value λJ ,
Eq.(1), is derived by considering a small perturbation in
a set of four equations that are the equation of continu-
ity, the Euler’s equation, the Poisson’s equation and the
equation of state of an ideal gas. The Jeans length es-
tablishes that if the wave length λ of density ﬂuctuation
is greater than λJ then the density will grow with time
in an exponential form and the system will become grav-
itationally unstable. For more details see Jiulin in ref.
[2].

Tsallis [3] has proposed an important extension of the
Boltzman-Gibbs (BG) statistical theory. In a brief and
technical terminology, this model is also currently re-
ferred to as a nonextensive (NE) statistical mechanics.

Tsallis thermostatistics formalism deﬁnes a nonaddi-

tive entropy as

where pi is the probability of the system to be in a mi-
crostate, W is the total number of conﬁgurations and
q, known in the current literature as being the Tsallis

parameter or NE parameter, is a real parameter which
quantiﬁes the degree of nonextensivity. The deﬁnition of
entropy in Tsallis statistics carries the usual properties
of positivity, equiprobability, concavity and irreversibil-
ity and it also has motivated the study of multifractals
systems. It is important to stress that Tsallis thermo-
statistics formalism contains the BG statistics as a par-
ticular case in the limit q → 1 where the usual additivity
of entropy is recovered.

Plastino and Lima [4] have derived a NE equiparti-
tion law of energy. It has been shown that the kinetic
foundations of Tsallis’ NE statistics leads to a velocity
distribution for free particles given by [5]

fq(v) = Bqh1 − (1 − q)

mv2

2kBTi1/1−q

,

(3)

where Bq is a normalization constant. Then, the expec-
tation value of v2, for each degree of freedom, is given by
[6]

< v2 >q= R ∞
R ∞

(4)

The equipartition theorem is then obtained by using

that

Eq =

2

N m < v2 >q,

and we will arrive at

Eq =

1

5 − 3q

N kBT .

(5)

(6)

The range of q is 0 ≤ q < 5/3. For q = 5/3 (critical
value) the expression of the equipartition law of energy,
Eq. (6), diverges. It is also easy to observe that for q = 1,
the classical equipartition theorem for each microscopic
degrees of freedom can be recovered.

On the other hand, concerning entropy, the recent for-
malism proposed by E. Verlinde [7] obtains the gravi-
tational acceleration by using the holographic principle
and the well known equipartition law of energy. His ideas
relied on the fact that gravitation can be considered uni-
versal and independent of the details of the spacetime
microstructure. Besides, he brought new concepts con-
cerning holography since the holographic principle must
unify matter, gravity and quantum mechanics.

The model considers a spherical surface as being the
holographic screen, with a particle of mass M positioned
in its center. The holographic screen can be imagined
as a storage device for information. The number of bits,
which is the smallest unit of information in the holo-
graphic screen, is assumed to be proportional to the holo-
graphic screen area A and can be written

N =

A
ℓ2
P

,

(7)

where A = 4πr2 and ℓP =pG/c3 is the Planck length

and ℓ2
P is the Planck area. In Verlinde’s framework one
can suppose that the bits total energy on the screen is
given by the equipartition law of energy

E =

1
2

N kBT.

(8)

It is important to notice that the usual equipartition
theorem in Eq. (8), can be derived from the usual BG
thermostatistics. Let us consider that the energy of the
particle inside the holographic screen is equally divided
by all bits in such a manner that we can have the expres-
sion

M c2 =

1
2

N kBT.

(9)

To obtain the gravitational acceleration, we can use
Eq. (7) and the Unruh temperature equation [8] given
by

2

As an application of NE equipartition theorem in Ver-
linde’s formalism we can use the NE equipartition for-
mula, i.e., Eq.
(6). Hence, we can obtain a modiﬁed
acceleration formula given by [9]

a = Gq

M
r2 ,

(12)

where Gq is an eﬀective gravitational constant which is
written as

Gq =

5 − 3q

2

G .

(13)

From result (13) we can observe that the eﬀective grav-
itational constant depends on the NE parameter q. For
example, when q = 1 we have Gq = G (BG scenario) and
for q = 5/3 we have the curious and hypothetical result
Gq = 0. This result shows us that q = 5/3 is an upper
bound limit when we are dealing with the holographic
screen, as we have said before. But now we have other
reasons to justify this classiﬁcation.

Substituting G by Gq, Eq.(13), in (1), we can derive
the same expression obtained by Jiulin[2] for the NE crit-
ical wavelength

(14)

This NE modiﬁcation of the Jeans criterion leads to a
c that depends on the nonextensive

new critical length λq
q-parameter as follows:

c = λJ , the usual Jeans criterion is

- If q = 1 ⇒ λ > λq
recovered.
- If 0 < q < 1 the Jeans criterion is modiﬁed as λ > λq
λJ .
- If 1 < q < 5/3, the Jeans criterion is modiﬁed as λ >
λq
c > λJ .
- If q → 5/3, λq
ways stable.

c → ∞, the self-gravitating system is al-

c <

.

Therefore, we have used Verlinde’s formalism and Tsal-
lis’ thermostatistics in order to derive the NE Jeans
length.

Hence, we are able to obtain the (absolute) gravita-

tional acceleration formula

From Eq. (11) we can see that the Newton constant G
can be written in terms of the fundamental constants,

On the other hand, considering the well known Kani-
adakis statistics [11], also called κ-statistics, similarly to
Tsallis thermostatistics formalism generalizes the stan-
dard BG statistics initially by the introduction of κ-
exponential and κ-logarithm deﬁned by

expκ(f ) =(cid:16)p1 + κ2f 2 + κf(cid:17)

lnκ(f ) =

f κ − f −κ

(15)

(16)

with the following operation being satisﬁed

where we arrive at[17]

3

kBT .

(24)

lnκ(cid:16)expκ(f )(cid:17) = expκ(cid:16) lnκ(f )(cid:17) ≡ f.

(17)

By Eqs.
(15) and (16) we can observe that the κ-
parameter deforms the usual deﬁnitions of the exponen-
tial and logarithm functions.

The κ-entropy associated with this κ-framework is

given by

(18)

which recovers the BG entropy in the limit κ → 0. It is
important to mention here that the κ-entropy has satis-
ﬁed the properties of concavity, additivity and extensiv-
ity. Tsallis’ entropy satisﬁes the property of concavity
and extensivity but not additivity. This property is not
fundamental, in principle. The κ-statistics has been suc-
cessfully applied in many experimental fronts. As an ex-
ample we can mention cosmic rays [12] and cosmic eﬀects
[? ], quark-gluon plasma [13], kinetic models describing
a gas of interacting atoms and photons [14] and ﬁnancial
models [15].

The kinetic foundations for the κ-statistics lead to a

velocity distribution for free particles given by [16]

Then, the expectation value of v2, for each degree of free-

The κ-equipartition theorem can be obtained by using

The range of κ is 0 ≤ κ < 2/3. For κ = 2/3 (critical
value) the expression of the equipartition law of energy,
Eq.
(24), diverges, which is equivalent to q = 5/3 in
Tsallis formalism. For κ = 0, the classical equipartition
theorem for each microscopic degrees of freedom can be
recovered.

On the other hand, if we use the Kaniadakis equipar-
tition theorem, Eq.(24), in the Verlinde formalism, the
modiﬁed acceleration formula is given by

a = Gκ

M
r2 ,

(25)

where Gκ is an eﬀective gravitational constant which is
written as

(26)

which can be written alternatively as G = f (κ) Gκ used
in Eq. (4.10)-(4.13), as we have explained in Section IV.
From the limits κ = 0, q = 1, with which we can recover
the BG statistics, and κ = 2/3, q = 5/3, we can establish
a linear relation between κ and q written as

κ = q − 1.

(27)

3 , q = 5
In particular, the limits κ = 0, q = 1 and κ = 2
3
lead to Gq = Gκ. It is clear that the relation (27) is valid
only for the range 1 ≤ q < 5/3.

Using Eq.(26), in (1), we have derived the expression

(28)

This κ modiﬁcation of the Jeans’ criterion leads to a new
critical length λκ
c that depends on the κ-parameter as
follows:

c = λJ , the usual Jeans criterion is

- If κ = 0 ⇒ λ > λκ
recovered.
- If 0 < κ < 2/3, the Jeans criterion is modiﬁed as λ >
λκ
c > λJ .
- If κ → 2/3−, λκ
always stable.

c → ∞, the self-gravitating system is

which agrees with the result Eq.(22).

Let us now apply the results developed above and in-
vestigate how non-gaussian statistics can aﬀect an astro-
physical system. We will use 16 mass measurements of
high X-ray luminosity clusters in the redshift range of
0.17 to 0.55. The X-ray luminosity of galaxies provides
up some information concerning their evolution, but here
let us speciﬁcally analyze the masses of these 16 clusters
obtained in [18]. If the galaxies are in equilibrium, the
virial mass of a cluster can be calculated as

M =

3
G

σ2
1r,

(33)

where σ1 and r are the velocity dispersion of the cluster
and the three dimensional virial radius, respectively. The
virial mass can be rewritten as

From Figure 1 we can observe that, except for the limit
values, κ = 0 and κ = 2/3, the Tsallis critical wave-
length is greater than the Kaniadakis critical wavelength.
This result indicates that the NE eﬀects of Tsallis’ statis-
tics lead to a self-gravitating system to be more stable
when compared with the eﬀects produced by Kaniadakis’
statistics since λq

J > λκ

It is possible to deﬁne a physical temperature [2], in
the context of Tsallis’ statistics. From Eqs.(6) and (14)
we can write

Tq =

2T

5 − 3q

.

(29)

It is easy to see that Tq = T if q → 1. Consequently

we have the NE sound velocity

vsq =r kBTq

m

,

(30)

which agrees with the result Eq.(4). We can also deﬁne
a physical temperature in the context of Kaniadakis’s
statistics. From Eqs.(24) and (28) we can write

Tκ =

We can show that Tκ = T if κ → 0. Consequently we

In Eqs. (34) and (35), Gq,κ is given by Eq. (13) and
(26), respectively.

We will estimate from now on how the theoretical pre-
dictions given by Eqs.
(34) and (35) can ﬁt the data
for the virial mass of the clusters compiled in [18] from
minimum chi-square estimation deﬁned by

where Mobs, Mth, and σM , represent the observation

with observational measure, respectively.

Figures 3 and 4 below show the results of our statisti-
cal analysis as function of ∆χ2 = χ2 − χ2
min at 1σ and
2σ conﬁdence level (CL) for the Tsallis and Kaniadakis
statistics, respectively. We note that q = 0.9918+0.0192

ment of the statistics, we considered κ ≥ 0, in order to
keep always Gκ ≥ 0.

Finally, we can say that in this work we have described
both non-gaussian statistical formalisms, Tsallis and Ka-

mulated by Jeans at the beginning of the last century. We

have seen that the limit for the Jeans instability condi-
tion is coherent with the standard values of q and κ in the
literature. After some computations, diﬀerent values for
the wavelength are compared trough comparing curves.
We have investigated how non-gaussian eﬀects can ﬁt the
masses of 16 galaxy clusters. We have found that the best
ﬁt value is completely compatible with BG statistics, but
the non-gaussian eﬀects cannot be discarded with the
present set of data. More speciﬁcally we note, (0.943)
