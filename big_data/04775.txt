Measurement of transverse energy at midrapidity

in Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV

ALICE Collaboration∗

Abstract

We report the transverse energy (ET) measured with ALICE at midrapidity in Pb–Pb collisions at
√sNN = 2.76 TeV as a function of centrality. The transverse energy was measured using identiﬁed
single particle tracks. The measurement was cross checked using the electromagnetic calorimeters
and the transverse momentum distributions of identiﬁed particles previously reported by ALICE. The
results are compared to theoretical models as well as to results from other experiments. The mean

ET per unit pseudorapidity (h ), hdET/dh i, in 0–5% central collisions is 1737 ± 6(stat.) ± 97 (sys.)
GeV. We ﬁnd a similar centrality dependence of the shape of hdET/dh i as a function of the number
of participating nucleons to that seen at lower energies. The growth in hdET/dh i at the LHC √sNN
exceeds extrapolations of low energy data. We observe a nearly linear scaling of hdET/dh i with the
that the energy density in 0–5% central Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV is 12.3 ± 1.0 GeV/fm3
and that the energy density at the most central 80 fm2 of the collision is at least 21.5 ± 1.7 GeV/fm3.
This is roughly 2.3 times that observed in 0–5% central Au–Au collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV.

Transverse energy at midrapidity in Pb–Pb collisions

ALICE Collaboration

1 Introduction

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts a phase transition of nuclear matter to a plasma of quarks and
gluons at energy densities above about 0.2-1 GeV/fm3 [1, 2]. This matter, called Quark–Gluon Plasma
(QGP), is produced in high energy nuclear collisions [3–13] and its properties are being investigated at
the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). The highest energy densities are achieved at the LHC in Pb–Pb collisions.

The mean transverse energy per unit pseudorapidity hdET/dh i conveys information about how much

of the initial longitudinal energy carried by the incoming nuclei is converted into energy carried by
the particles produced transverse to the beam axis. The transverse energy at midrapidity is therefore
a measure of the stopping power of nuclear matter. By using simple geometric considerations [14]

equilibrium.

hdET/dh i can provide information on the energy densities attained. Studies of the centrality and √sNN
dependence of hdET/dh i therefore provide insight into the conditions prior to thermal and chemical
The hdET/dh i has been measured at the AGS by E802 [15] and E814/E877 [16], at the SPS by NA34 [17],
NA35 [18], NA49 [19], and WA80/93/98 [20, 21], at RHIC by PHENIX [22–24] and STAR [25], and at
the LHC by CMS [26], covering nearly three orders of magnitude of √sNN. The centrality dependence
has also been studied extensively with hdET/dh i at midrapidity scaling nearly linearly with the collision

volume, or equivalently, the number of participating nucleons at lower energies [20, 27, 28]. Further
studies of heavy-ion collisions revealed deviations from this simple participant scaling law [21]. The
causes of this deviation from linearity are still actively discussed and might be related to effects from
minijets [29, 30] or constituent quark scaling [31, 32].

The ALICE detector [33] has precision tracking detectors and electromagnetic calorimeters, enabling

several different methods for measuring ET. In this paper we discuss measurements of hdET/dh i in Pb–
Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV using the tracking detectors alone and using the combined information
from the tracking detectors and the electromagnetic calorimeters. In addition we compare to calculations
of hdET/dh i from the measured identiﬁed particle transverse momentum distributions. Measurements

from the tracking detectors alone provide the highest precision. We compare our results to theoretical
calculations and measurements at lower energies.

2 Experiment

A comprehensive description of the ALICE detector can be found in [33]. This analysis uses the V0, Zero
Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs), the Inner Tracking System (ITS), the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), the
ElectroMagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal), and the PHOton Spectrometer (PHOS), all of which are located
inside a 0.5 T solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld. The V0 detector [34] consists of two scintillator hodoscopes

covering the pseudorapidity ranges −3.7 < h < −1.7 and 2.8 < h < 5.1. The ZDCs each consist of a

neutron calorimeter between the beam pipes downstream of the dipole magnet and a proton calorimeter
external to the outgoing beam pipe.

The TPC [35], the main tracking detector at midrapidity, is a cylindrical drift detector ﬁlled with a Ne–
CO2 gas mixture. The active volume is nearly 90 m3 and has inner and outer radii of 0.848 m and
2.466 m, respectively. It provides particle identiﬁcation via the measurement of the speciﬁc ionization
energy loss (dE/dx) with a resolution of 5.2% and 6.5% in peripheral and central collisions, respectively.

The ITS [33] consists of the Silicon Pixel Detector with layers at radii of 3.9 cm and 7.6 cm, the Silicon
Drift Detector with layers at radii of 15.0 cm and 23.9 cm, and the Silicon Strip Detector with layers at
radii of 38.0 and 43.0 cm. The TPC and ITS are aligned to within a few hundred m m using cosmic ray
and pp collision data [36].

The EMCal [37, 38] is a lead/scintillator sampling calorimeter covering |h | < 0.7 in pseudorapidity and
100◦ in azimuth in 2011. The EMCal consists of 11520 towers, each with transverse size 6 cm × 6 cm, or
approximately twice the effective Moli`ere radius. The relative energy resolution is p0.112/E + 0.0172
where the energy E is measured in GeV [37]. Clusters are formed by combining signals from adja-
cent towers. Each cluster is required to have only one local energy maximum. Noise is suppressed
by requiring a minimum tower energy of 0.05 GeV. For this analysis we use clusters within |h | < 0.6.
The PHOS [39] is a lead tungstate calorimeter covering |h | < 0.12 in pseudorapidity and 60◦ in az-
imuth. The PHOS consists of three modules of 64 × 56 towers each, with each tower having a trans-
verse size of 2.2 cm × 2.2 cm, comparable to the Moli`ere radius. The relative energy resolution is
p0.0132/E 2 + 0.0362/E + 0.012 where the energy E is measured in GeV [40].

The minimum-bias trigger for Pb–Pb collisions in 2010 was deﬁned by a combination of hits in the V0
detector and the two innermost (pixel) layers of the ITS [8]. In 2011 the minimum-bias trigger signals
in both neutron ZDCs were also required [41]. The collision centrality is determined by comparing the
multiplicity measured in the V0 detector to Glauber model simulations of the multiplicity [8, 34]. These
calculations are also used to determine the number of participating nucleons, hNparti. We restrict our
analysis to the 0–80% most central collisions. For these centralities corrections due to electromagnetic
interactions and trigger inefﬁciencies are negligible. We use data from approximately 70k 0-80% central
events taken in 2011 for the tracking detector and EMCal measurements and data from approximately
600k 0-80% central events taken in 2010 for the PHOS measurement. We focus on a small event sam-
ple where the detector performance was uniform in order to simplify efﬁciency corrections since the
measurement is dominated by systematic uncertainties.

Tracks are reconstructed using both the TPC and the ITS. Tracks are selected by requiring that they

cross at least 70 rows and requiring a c 2 per space point < 4. Tracks are restricted to |h | < 0.6. Each
track is required to have at least one hit in one of the two innermost ITS layers and a small distance of
closest approach (DCA) to the primary vertex in the xy plane as a function of transverse momentum (pT),
deﬁned by DCAxy < (0.0182+0.035/ p1.01
) cm where pT is in GeV/c. The distance of closest approach
in the z direction is restricted to DCAz < 2 cm. This reduces the contribution from secondary particles
from weak decays, which appear as a background. With these selection criteria tracks with transverse
momenta pT > 150 MeV/c can be reconstructed. The typical momentum resolution for low momentum
tracks, which dominate ET measurements, is D pT/pT ≈ 1%. The reconstruction efﬁciency varies with
pT and ranges from about 50% to 75% [41].

T

Particles are identiﬁed through their speciﬁc energy loss, dE/dx, in the TPC when possible. The dE/dx
is calculated using a truncated-mean procedure and compared to the dE/dx expected for a given particle
species using a Bethe-Bloch parametrization. The deviation from the expected dE/dx value is expressed
in units of the energy-loss resolution s
[42]. Tracks are identiﬁed as arising from a kaon if they are within
3s
from the expected dE/dx for a proton or a pion,
and have pT < 0.45 GeV/c. Tracks are identiﬁed as arising from (anti)protons if they are within 3s
from
the expected dE/dx for (anti)protons, more than 3s
from the expected dE/dx for kaons or pions, and have
pT < 0.9 GeV/c. Tracks are identiﬁed as arising from an electron (positron) and therefore excluded from
from the expected dE/dx for an electron (positron), more

than 4s
from the expected dE/dx for a proton or
kaon. With this algorithm approximately 0.1% of tracks arise from electrons or positrons misidentiﬁed
as arising from pions and fewer than 0.1% of tracks are misidentiﬁed as arising from kaons or protons.
Any track not identiﬁed as a kaon or proton is assumed to arise from a pion and the measurement must
be corrected for the error in this assumption.

The PHOS and EMCal are used to measure the electromagnetic energy component of the ET and to
demonstrate consistency between methods. Data from 2011 were used for the EMCal analysis due to
the larger EMCal acceptance in 2011. Data from one run in 2010 were used for the PHOS due to better

detector performance and understanding of the calibrations in that run period. The EMCal has a larger
acceptance, but the PHOS has a better energy resolution. There is also a lower material budget in front
of the PHOS than the EMCal. This provides an additional check on the accuracy of the measurement.

3 Method

Historically most ET measurements have been performed using calorimeters, and the commonly accepted
operational deﬁnition of ET is therefore based on the energy E j measured in the calorimeter’s jth tower

ET =

Ej sinq j

M(cid:229)

j=1

(1)

where j runs over all M towers in the calorimeter and q j is the polar angle of the calorimeter tower. The
transverse energy can also be calculated using single particle tracks. In that case, the index, j, in Eq. 1
runs over the M measured particles instead of calorimeter towers, and q j is the particle emission angle.
In order to be compatible with the ET of a calorimetry measurement, the energy Ej of Eq. 1 must be
replaced with the single particle energies

This deﬁnition of ET was used in the measurements of the transverse energy by CMS [26] (based on
calorimetry), PHENIX [22] (based on electromagnetic calorimetry), and STAR [25] (based on a combi-
nation of electromagnetic calorimetry and charged particle tracking). To facilitate comparison between
the various data sets the deﬁnition of ET given by Eqs. 1 and 2 is used here.

It is useful to classify particles by how they interact with the detector. We deﬁne the following categories
of ﬁnal state particles:

A p ±, K±, p, and p: Charged particles measured with high efﬁciency by tracking detectors
B p 0, w
, L
C L

, h , e±, and g : Particles measured with high efﬁciency by electromagnetic calorimeters

S, S +, S −, and S 0: Particles measured with low efﬁciency in tracking detectors and electro-

magnetic calorimeters

D K0

L, n, and n: Neutral particles not measured well by either tracking detectors or electromagnetic
calorimeters.

(W

The total ET is the sum of the ET observed in ﬁnal state particles in categories A-D. Contributions from
all other particles are negligible. In HIJING 1.383 [43] simulations of Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76
TeV the next largest contributions come from the X (X ) and W
) baryons with a total contribution of
about 0.4% of the total ET, much less than the systematic uncertainty on the ﬁnal value of ET. The ET
from unstable particles with ct < 1 cm is taken into account through the ET from their decay particles.
When measuring ET using tracking detectors, the primary measurement is of particles in category A
and corrections must be applied to take into account the ET which is not observed from particles in
categories B-D. In the hybrid method the ET from particles in category A is measured using tracking
detectors and the ET from particles in category B is measured by the electromagnetic calorimeter. An
electromagnetic calorimeter has the highest efﬁciency for measuring particles in category B, although
there is a substantial background from particles in category A. The ET from categories C and D, which
is not well measured by an electromagnetic calorimeter, must be corrected for on average. Following the

Several corrections are calculated using HIJING [43] simulations. The propagation of ﬁnal state particles
in these simulations through the ALICE detector material is described using GEANT 3 [44]. Throughout
the paper these are described as HIJING+GEANT simulations.

3.1.1 Single track efﬁciency×acceptance e (pT)
The single track efﬁciency×acceptance is determined by comparing the primary yields to the recon-
structed yields using HIJING+GEANT simulations, as described in [45]. When a particle can be iden-
tiﬁed as a p ±, K±, p, or p using the algorithm described above, the efﬁciency for that particle is used.
Otherwise the particle-averaged efﬁciency is used. The 5% systematic uncertainty is determined by the
difference between the fraction of TPC standalone tracks matched with a hit in the ITS in simulations
and data.

The background comes from photons which convert to e+e− in the detector and decay daughters from L
, and K0

,
S which are observed in the tracking detectors but do not originate from primary p ±, K±, p, and
p. This is determined from HIJING+GEANT simulations. The systematic uncertainty on the background

lations by ±10% and found to be negligible compared to other systematic uncertainties. The systematic
uncertainty due to L

spectra. To determine the contribution from L
S decay daughters and its systematic uncertainty
the spectra in simulation are reweighted to match the data and the yields are varied within their uncer-
tainties [46]. Because the centrality dependence is less than the uncertainty due to other corrections, a
constant correction of 0.982 ± 0.008 is applied across all centralities .
3.1.3 Particle identiﬁcation fnotID

, and K0

The ET of particles with 0.15 < pT < 0.45 GeV/c with a dE/dx within two standard deviations of the
expected dE/dx for kaons is calculated using the kaon mass and the ET of particles with 0.15 < pT < 0.9
GeV/c with a dE/dx within two standard deviations of the expected dE/dx for (anti)protons is calculated
using the (anti)proton mass. The ET of all other particles is calculated using the pion mass. Since the
average transverse momentum is hpTi = 0.678 ± 0.007 GeV/c for charged particles [47] and over 80%
of the particles created in the collision are pions [42], most particles can be identiﬁed correctly using
this algorithm. At high momentum, the difference between the true ET and the ET calculated using the
pion mass hypothesis for kaons and protons is less than at low pT. This is therefore a small correction.
Assuming that all kaons with 0.15 < pT < 0.45 GeV/c and (anti)protons with 0.15 < pT < 0.9 GeV/c are
identiﬁed correctly and using the identifed p ±, K±, p, and p spectra [42] gives fnotID = 0.992 ± 0.002.

The systematic uncertainty is determined from the uncertainties on the yields.

Assuming that 5% of kaons and protons identiﬁed using the particle identiﬁcation algorithm described
above are misidentiﬁed as pions only decreases fnotID by 0.0002, less than the systematic uncertainty on
fnotID. This indicates that this correction is robust to changes in the mean dE/dx expected for a given
particle and its standard deviation. We note that either assuming no particle identiﬁcation or doubling
the number of kaons and protons only decreases fnotID by 0.005.

3.1.4 Low pT acceptance fpTcut
The lower momentum acceptance of the tracking detectors is primarily driven by the magnetic ﬁeld and
the inner radius of the active volume of the detector. Tracks can be reliably reconstructed in the TPC for
particles with pT > 150 MeV/c. The fraction of ET carried by particles below this momentum cut-off
is determined by HIJING+GEANT simulations. To calculate the systematic uncertainty we follow the
prescription given by STAR [25]. The fraction of ET contained in particles below 150 MeV/c is calculated
assuming that all particles below this cut-off have a momentum of exactly 150 MeV/c to determine an
upper bound, assuming that they have a momentum of 0 MeV/c to determine a lower bound, and using the
average as the nominal value. Using this prescription, fpTcut = 0.9710 ± 0.0058. We note that fpTcut is the
same within systematic uncertainties when calculated from PYTHIA simulations [48] for pp collisions
with √s = 0.9 and 8 TeV, indicating that this is a robust quantity.

3.1.5 Correction factors fneutral and ftotal

Under the assumption that the different states within an isospin multiplet and particles and antiparticles
have the same ET, fneutral can be written as

same particle species (e.g., p + and p −) are 100% correlated and from different species (e.g., p + and
K+) are uncorrelated. The contribution from the S +, S −, and S 0 and their antiparticles is determined

, e±, and g , as described earlier. Because most of the ET is carried by p ±, K±, p, p,
n, and n, whose contributions appear in both the numerator and the denominator, ftotal and fneutral can be
determined to high precision, and the uncertainty in ftotal and fneutral is driven by EL
. It is
worth considering two special cases. If all ET were carried by pions, as is the case at low energy where
almost exclusively pions are produced, Eq. 6 would simplify to ftotal = 2/3. If all ET were only carried
by kaons, (anti)protons, and (anti)neutrons, Eq. 6 would simplify to ftotal = 1/2.
In order to calculate the contribution from the h meson and its uncertainties, we assume that the shapes
of its spectra for all centrality bins as a function of transverse mass are the same as the pion spectra,
using the transverse mass scaling [50], and that the h /p
ratio is independent of the collision system, as
observed by PHENIX [51]. We also consider a scenario where the h spectrum is assumed to have the
same shape as the kaon spectrum, as would be expected if the shape of the h spectrum was determined
by hydrodynamical ﬂow. In this case we use the ALICE measurements of h /p
in pp collisions [52] to
determine the relative yields. We use the h /p
ratio at the lowest momentum point available, pT = 0.5
GeV/c, because the ET measurement is dominated by low momentum particles. Because no w measure-
ment exists, PYTHIA [48] simulations of pp collisions were used to determine the relative contribution
from the w
and from all other particles which interact electromagnetically (mainly g and e±). These
contributions were approximately 2% and 1% of Ep
/Ep
T
= 0.17 ± 0.11. The systematic uncertainty on this fraction is dominated by the uncertainty in the h /p
ratio. We propagate the uncertainties assuming that the ET from the same particle species are 100%
correlated and that the uncertainties from different particle species are uncorrelated.
The fneutral, ftotal, and fem = 1− ftotal/ fneutral are shown in Fig. 1 along with the fractions of ET carried by
all pions fp , all kaons fK, protons and antiprotons fp, and L baryons fL versus hNparti. While there is
a slight dependence of the central value on hNparti, this variation is less than the systematic uncertainty.
Since there is little centrality dependence, we use fem = 0.240 ± 0.027, fneutral = 0.728 ± 0.017, and
ftotal = 0.553 ± 0.010, which encompass the entire range for all centralities. The systematic uncertainty
, h , e±, and g since these particles only appear in the
is largely driven by the contribution from L
denominator of Eqs. 5 and 6. The systematic uncertainty on ftotal is smaller than that on fneutral because
fneutral only has EL
These results are independently interesting. The fraction of energy carried by different species does not
change signiﬁcantly with centrality. Additionally, only about 1/4 of the energy is in E em
T , much less than
T at lower energies where most particles produced are pions with the p 0
the roughly 1/3 of energy in E em
carrying approximately 1/3 of the energy in the collision. Furthermore, only about 3.5% of the ET is
carried by w
, h , e±, and g . Since charged and neutral pions have comparable spectra, this means that
the tracking detectors are highly effective for measuring the transverse energy distribution in nuclear
collisions.

We use the transverse momentum distributions (spectra) measured by ALICE [42, 46] to calculate ET
and E had
as a cross check. We assume that all charge signs and isospin states of each particle carry
the same ET, e.g. Ep +
T , and that the ET carried by (anti)neutrons equals the ET carried
by (anti)protons. These assumptions are consistent with the data at high energies where positively and
negatively charged hadrons are produced at similar rates and the anti-baryon to baryon ratio is close to

(12%) decays, mean-
ing that the vast majority of E em
arises from photons reaching the active area of the electromagnetic
T
calorimeters. Reconstructed clusters are used for the analysis, with most clusters arising from a single g .
Clusters reduce contributions from detector noise to a negligible level, as compared to using tower ener-
gies as done by STAR [25]. However, clusters also require additional corrections for the reconstruction
efﬁciency, nonlinearity, and minimum energy reconstructed. In addition, both the EMCal and the PHOS
have limited nominal acceptances so an acceptance correction must be applied. Backgrounds come from
charged hadrons in category A (p ±, K±, p, and p), kaon decays into p 0 from both category A (K±) and
category C (K0
S), neutrons from category D, and particles produced by secondary interactions with the
detector material.

fETmin is a correction for the minimum cluster energy used in the analysis, d m is zero when a cluster is
matched to a track and one otherwise, e g is the product of the active acceptance and the reconstruction
efﬁciency in the nominal acceptance of the detector, fENL is the correction for the nonlinear response
of the calorimeter, and E bkgd
is the sum of the contributions from charged hadrons, kaons, neutrons,
and particles created by secondary interactions. These correction factors are discussed below and their
systematic uncertainties are summarized in Tab. 2. All of the systematic uncertainties except for that due
to the background subtraction are correlated point to point. Systematic uncertainties on measurements
of E em
from the spectra are not correlated.
T
Systematic uncertainties on hybrid measurements are dominated by systematic uncertainties on E had
and
are therefore dominantly correlated point to point and with the tracking detector measurements.
3.3.1 Acceptance correction facc and cluster reconstruction efﬁciency e g
The correction for the acceptance is divided into two parts, the correction due to the nominal acceptance
of the detector and the correction due to limited acceptance within the nominal acceptance of the detector
due to dead regions and edge effects. To reduce edge effects, clusters in the PHOS are restricted to

from the EMCal and the PHOS and calculations of E em
T

|h | < 0.1 and in the EMCal to |h | < 0.6. The correction facc accounts for the limited nominal acceptance
in azimuth and is therefore 5/18 for the EMCal, which has a nominal acceptance of 100◦, and 1/6 for
the PHOS, which has a nominal acceptance of 60◦. It does not correct for acceptance effects due to
dead regions in the detector or for noisy towers omitted from the analysis. This is accounted for by
the cluster reconstruction efﬁciency×acceptance within the nominal detector acceptance, e g , calculated
from HIJING+GEANT simulations using photons from the decay of the p 0 meson. The efﬁciency is
calculated as a function of the energy of the cluster.

3.3.2 Minimum cluster energy fETmin
There is a minimum energy for usable clusters analogous to the minimum pT in the acceptance of the
tracking detectors. A threshold of 250 MeV for PHOS and 300 MeV for the EMCal is applied. These
energies are above the peak energy for minimum ionizing particles (MIPs), reducing the background
correction due to charged hadrons. We apply the threshold in ET rather than energy because it simpliﬁes
the calculation of the correction for this threshold and its systematic uncertainty. We use the charged

10

D
Transverse energy at midrapidity in Pb–Pb collisions

ALICE Collaboration

pion spectra to calculate the fraction of E em
T below these thresholds. PYTHIA is used to simulate the
decay kinematics and the measured charged pion spectra are used to determine the fraction of ET from
pions within the acceptance. As for the calculation of ftotal for the measurement of E had
T described above,
we assume transverse mass scaling to determine the shape of the h spectrum and the h /p ratio measured
by ALICE [52] to estimate the contribution of the h meson to fETmin. The uncertainty on the shape of
the charged pion spectrum and on the h /p
ratio is used to determine the uncertainty on fETmin. This
correction is centrality dependent and ranges from 0.735 to 0.740 for the PHOS and from 0.640 to 0.673
for the EMCal with a systematic uncertainty of 3.5–5%.

3.3.3 Nonlinearity correction fENL and energy scale uncertainty
For an ideal calorimeter the signal observed is proportional to the energy. In practice, however, there
is a slight deviation from linearity in the signal observed, particularly at low energies. A nonlinearity
correction is applied to take this into account. For the EMCal this deviation from linearity reaches a
maximum of about 15% for the lowest energy clusters used in this analysis. The systematic uncertainty
for the EMCal is determined by comparing the nonlinearity observed in test beam and the nonlinearity
predicted by HIJING+GEANT simulations and reaches a maximum of about 5% for the lowest energy
clusters. The PHOS nonlinearity is determined by comparing the location of the p 0 mass peak to HI-
JING+GEANT simulations and cross checked using the energy divided by the momentum for identiﬁed
electrons. The systematic uncertainty is derived from the accuracy of the location of the p 0 mass peak.
The nominal correction is about 1% with a maximum systematic uncertainty of around 3% for the lowest
energy clusters. The raw E em
T is calculated with the maxima and minima of the nonlinearities and the dif-
ference from the nominal value is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The ﬁnal systematic uncertainty
on the measurement with the EMCal due to nonlinearity is about 0.8% and 1.3% for the PHOS. For both
the PHOS and the EMCal, the energy scale uncertainty was determined by comparing the location of the
p 0 mass peak and the ratio of energy over momentum for electrons. This systematic uncertainty is 2%
for the EMCal [56] and 0.5% for the PHOS [57].

T

3.3.4 Background Ebkgd
Charged particles (category A) are the largest source of background in E em
T . Clusters matched to tracks
are omitted from the analysis. The track matching efﬁciency determined from HIJING+GEANT simu-
lations is combined with information from clusters matched to tracks to calculate the number and mean
energy of remaining deposits from charged particles. The systematic uncertainty on this contribution
comes from the uncertainty on the track matching efﬁciency and the uncertainty in the mean energy.
The former is dominated by the uncertainty on the single track reconstruction efﬁciency and the latter is
determined by comparing central and peripheral collisions, assuming that the energy of clusters matched
to tracks in central collisions may be skewed by overlapping clusters due to the high occupancy.

S (category C) through its K0

The background contributions from both charged kaons (category A) through their K± → Xp 0 decays
S → p 0 p 0 decay are non-negligible. The amount of energy deposited
and K0
by a kaon as a function of pT is determined using HIJING+GEANT simulations. This is combined with
the kaon spectra measured by ALICE [42] to calculate the energy deposited in the calorimeters by kaons.
The systematic uncertainty on the background from kaons is determined by varying the yields within the
uncertainties of the spectra. Contributions from both neutrons and particles from secondary interactions
are determined using HIJING+GEANT simulations. The systematic uncertainty on these contributions
is determined by assuming that they scale with either the number of tracks (as a proxy for the number
of charged particles) or with the number of calorimeter clusters (as a proxy for the number of neutral
particles).

The background contribution is centrality dependent and ranges from 61% to 73% with both the back-
ground and its systematic uncertainty dominated by contributions from charged hadrons. This correction

3.3.5 Acceptance effects

The limited calorimeter acceptance distorts the distribution of E em
T because
it is difﬁcult to measure the mean ET when the mean number of clusters observed is small (about 1–
10). While it is possible to correct for acceptance, this was not done since the measurement of ET
from the tracking method has the highest precision. The hybrid method using both the calorimeters and
the tracking detectors is therefore restricted to the most central collisions where distortions of the E em
T
distribution are negligible.

4 Results
The hdET/dh i/(hNpart/2i) versus hNparti is shown in Fig. 7 using tracking detectors, using EMCal+tracking,

using PHOS+tracking, and as calculated from the measured particle spectra. All methods lead to com-
parable results, although the systematic errors are largely correlated due to the dominant correction from
the tracking inefﬁciency. The Glauber calculations of hNparti and its uncertainties are calculated as in [55]
and the uncertainties on hNparti are added in quadrature to the uncertainties on ET. As discussed above,
the small number of clusters observed in the calorimeters in peripheral collisions make acceptance cor-
rections difﬁcult. Since the measurements with the tracking detectors alone has higher precision, only
these measurements are used in the following.

Fig. 8 compares hdET/dh i/(hNpart/2i) versus hNparti in Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV from
CMS [26] and ALICE, and in Au–Au collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV from STAR [25] and PHENIX [22,
23]. Data from RHIC have been scaled by a factor of 2.7 for comparison of the shapes. The factor of 2.7 is
approximately the ratio of hpTihdNch/dh i at the LHC [42] to that at RHIC [58, 59]. The shapes observed
by ALICE and PHENIX are comparable for all hNparti. STAR measurements are consistent with PHENIX
measurements for the most central collisions and above the PHENIX measurements, although consistent
within systematic uncertainties, for more peripheral collisions. CMS measurements are consistent with
ALICE measurements for peripheral collisions but deviate beyond the systematic uncertainties for more
central collisions. The ET in Pb–Pb collisions is 1737 ± 6(stat.) ± 97 (sys.) GeV and the ET per
participant is 9.02 ± 0.03(stat.) ± 0.50 (sys.) GeV, two standard deviations below the value observed by
CMS [26]. All methods resulted in a lower ET than that reported by CMS, although the systematic errors
on the measurements are signiﬁcantly correlated. The corrections for the CMS data are determined by
Monte Carlo [26] while the corrections for the ALICE measurement are mainly data-driven.

PHENIX [24] reported that while hdET/dh i scaled by hNparti has a pronounced centrality dependence,
as seen in Fig. 8, hdET/dh i scaled by the number of constituent quarks, hNquarki, hdET/dh i/(hNquark/2i)
shows little centrality dependence within the systematic uncertainties for collisions at √sNN = 62.4 – 200
GeV. This indicates that ET might scale linearly with the number of quarks participating in the collision
rather than the number of participating nucleons. Fig. 9 shows hdET/dh i/(hNquark/2i) as a function of
hNparti. To calculate hNquarki the standard Monte Carlo Glauber technique [28] has been used with the
following Woods-Saxon nuclear density parameters: radius parameter RWS = 6.62±0.06 fm, diffuseness
a = 0.546± 0.010 fm, and hard core dmin = 0.4± 0.4 fm. The three constituent quarks in each nucleon
have been sampled from the nucleon density distribution r nucleon = r 0e−ar with a = 4.28 f m−1 using the
method developed by PHENIX [60]. The inelastic quark-quark cross section at √sNN = 2.76 TeV was
found to be s
NN = 64± 5 mb [55]. The systematic uncertainties
on the hNquarki calculations were determined following the procedure described in [55]. Unlike at RHIC,
we observe an increase in hdET/dh i/(hNquark/2i) with centrality below hNparti ≈200.

tially underestimates the hdET/dh i/(hNpart/2i) at the LHC. The data are also compared to the EKRT
model [61, 62]. The EKRT model combines perturbative QCD minijet production with gluon saturation
and hydrodynamics. The EKRT calculation qualitatively describes the √sNN dependence at RHIC and
SPS energies [25]. However, at LHC energies EKRT overestimates ET substantially, indicating that it is
unable to describe the collision energy dependence.

Figure 12 shows a comparison of hdET/dh i/hdNch/dh i versus √sNN in 0-5% central Pb–Pb collisions

indicated that hdET/dh i/hdNch/dh i had either saturated at RHIC energies or showed only a weak de-
pendence on √sNN [22, 25, 60]. An empirical extrapolation of the data to LHC energies assuming that
both ET and hNchi have a linear dependence on √sNN predicted that hdET/dh i/hdNch/dh i would be 0.92
± 0.06 [22] and we observe 1.06 ± 0.05. Increasing the incident energy increases both the particle pro-
duction and the mean energy per particle at LHC energies, in contrast to lower energies (√sNN = 19.6 –

Figure 13 shows a comparison of hdET/dh i/(hNpart/2i) versus hNparti to various models. AMPT [64]

is a Monte Carlo event generator which builds on HIJING [43], adding explicit interactions between
initial minijet partons and ﬁnal state hadronic interactions. HYDJET 1.8 [65] is a Monte Carlo event
generator that introduces jet quenching via gluon bremsstrahlung to PYTHIA [48] events. The curves
labeled UDG are calculations from a Color Glass Condensate model [66] with different normalization
K factors. None of the available models is able to describe the data very well, but we ﬁnd that AMPT

does best in describing the shape and level of hdET/dh i/(hNpart/2i). HYDJET describes the relative
shape changes as a function of centrality as well as AMPT, but overestimates hdET/dh i/(hNpart/2i).
Both CGC calculations overestimate hdET/dh i/(hNpart/2i) and predict a larger increase as a function of
The volume-averaged energy density e can be estimated from hdET/dh i using the following expres-

where A is the effective transverse collision area, c is the speed of light, J is the Jacobian for the trans-

formation between hdET/dh i and hdET/dyi, and t 0 is the formation time. The Jacobian is calculated
from the measured particle spectra [42, 46]. While J has a slight centrality dependence, it is smaller than
the systematic uncertainty so a constant Jacobian of J = 1.12 ± 0.06 is used. The formation time of the
system t 0 is highly model dependent and we therefore report et 0.
The transverse overlap area corresponding to the measured hdET/dh i was determined by a calculation
using a Glauber Monte Carlo method. Using the Glauber parameters from [55] and assuming each
participating nucleon has an effective transverse radius of R = (s
NN /4p )1/2 = 0.71 fm results in A =
162.5 fm2 for central collisions (b = 0 fm). This is equivalent to a transverse overlap radius of R = 7.19
fm, which is close to the value of 7.17 fm often used in estimates of energy densities using a Woods-
Saxon distribution to determine the effective area [24, 60]. The centrality dependence of A is obtained by
assuming it scales as (s 2
xy is the covariance
x
of the spatial distribution of the participating nucleons in the transverse plane in the Glauber Monte Carlo
calculation. For 0–5% central collisions this leads to a reduction of A by 3% resulting in et 0 = 12.5 ±
1.0 GeV/fm2/c. For comparison using R = 7.17 fm gives et 0 = 12.3 ± 1.0 GeV/fm2/c, roughly 2.3 times
that observed in 0–5% central Au–Au collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV. Some of this increase comes from
the higher hNparti in central Pb–Pb collisions relative to central Au–Au collisions The energy density
times the formation time et 0 is shown in Fig. 14 for R = 7.17 fm in order to be comparable to previous
measurements [24, 60].

In addition to estimating the volume averaged energy density it is also interesting to estimate the energy
density attained at the core of the collision area. This can be done by rewriting the Bjorken Eq. 8 as

scales with the participant density in the transverse plane and that the measured value of D dET
dh E/hNparti,
which is averaged over the total transverse collision area, is also representative of the transverse energy
dh Ec
production at the core, D dET
/hNpartic. The increase of this quantity with increasing centrality indicates
that this is a conservative estimate. From a Glauber Monte Carlo calculation we ﬁnd for 0–5% centrality
s c = 4.2± 0.1 nucleon/fm2 resulting in a core energy density of e ct 0 = 21± 2 GeV/fm2/c. For the most
central 80 fm2 (half the total overlap area) the energy density is still above 80% of the core energy density
emphasizing that the core energy density may be more relevant for judging the initial conditions of the
QGP than the volume averaged energy density.

5 Conclusions
We have measured hdET/dh i at midrapidity in Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV using four differ-

ent methods. All methods lead to comparable results, although the systematic uncertainties are largely
correlated. Our results are consistent with results from CMS [26] for 10–80% central collisions, how-

ever, we observe a lower hdET/dh i in 0–10% central collisions. The hdET/dh i observed at √sNN
= 2.76 TeV in 0–5% central collisions is 1737 ± 6(stat.) ± 97 (sys.) GeV. The shape of the cen-
trality dependence of hdET/dh i/(hNpart/2i) is similar for RHIC and the LHC. No centrality depen-
dence of hdET/dh i/hdNch/dh i is observed within uncertainties, as was observed at RHIC. Unlike at
RHIC, we observe an increase in hdET/dh i/(hNquark/2i) with centrality below hNparti ≈200. Both
hdET/dh i/(hNpart/2i) and hdET/dh i/hdNch/dh i in central collisions exceed the value expected from
naive extrapolations from data at lower collision energies. Assuming that if the formation time t 0 is 1
fm/c the energy density is estimated to be at least 12.3 ± 1.0 GeV/fm3 in 0–5% central Pb–Pb collisions
at √sNN = 2.76 TeV and the energy density at the core of the collision exceeds 21 ± 2 GeV/fm3.
