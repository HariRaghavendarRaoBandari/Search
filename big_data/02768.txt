Abstract

We review various superspace approaches to the description of the low-energy eﬀective
action in N = 4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. We consider the four-derivative part of
the low-energy eﬀective action in the Coulomb branch. The typical components of this
eﬀective action are the gauge ﬁeld F 4/X 4 and the scalar ﬁeld Wess-Zumino terms. We
construct N = 4 supersymmetric completions of these terms in the framework of diﬀerent
harmonic superspaces supporting N = 2, 3, 4 supersymmetries. These approaches are
complementary to each other in the sense that they make manifest diﬀerent subgroups
of the total SU(4) R-symmetry group. We show that the eﬀective action acquires an
extremely simple form in those superspaces which manifest the non-anomalous maximal
subgroups of SU(4). The common characteristic feature of our construction is that we
restore the superﬁeld eﬀective actions exclusively by employing the N = 4 supersymmetry
and/or superconformal P SU(2, 2|4) symmetry.

Introduction

N = 4 SYM theory in four-dimensional Minkowski space is an exceptional model of
quantum ﬁeld theory. Originally, it was constructed by compactiﬁcation of the 10D
super-Yang-Mills theory [1]. Shortly after its discovery, this theory was found to exhibit
miraculous cancelations of ultraviolet divergences, so that its beta-function is zero to all
loops [2, 3, 4] and the model is UV ﬁnite and superconformal [5]. This result triggered a
high interest in studying other four-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theories, though N = 4
SYM theory remains the key example of the UV ﬁnite ﬁeld theories.

Although N = 4 SYM theory has no phenomenological applications, it plays a crucial
role for the study of quantum aspects of string theory through the so-called AdS/CFT
(or “gauge/gravity”) correspondence [6, 7, 8] (see also [9] for a review). In the original
Maldacena’s work [6] it was conjectured that quantum observables in IIB superstring
theory on the AdS5 × S5 background can be determined by studying the corresponding
objects in N = 4 SYM theory. Since 1998, Maldacena’s conjecture has been thoroughly
veriﬁed and nowadays we have a good understanding of quantum properties of both sides
of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

In quantum ﬁeld theory, there are several objects exhibiting physical properties of a
given model: scattering amplitudes, correlation functions and Wilson loops. All these
quantities have been investigated in N = 4 SYM theory and then have been matched
with the corresponding objects in string theory. The detailed exposition of these results
can be retrieved from numerous review papers and textbooks, see, e.g., [10]. The short
summary is that many of these quantum quantities in N = 4 SYM theory can be found
exactly beyond the perturbation theory. These exact results provide a strong ground for
the further studies of string theory, as well as of many other superconformal ﬁeld theories
- with diﬀerent amounts of supersymmetry and in diverse space-time dimensions.

An object of the crucial importance in quantum ﬁeld theory is the eﬀective action.
By deﬁnition, it is the generating functional for 1PI (“one-particle-irreducible”) Green’s
functions, which encodes the full information about quantum properties of given model.
It can also be viewed as a functional reproducing the eﬀective equations of motion which
take into account quantum corrections. Since the eﬀective action is a very complicated
object, it makes sense to study ﬁrst its low-energy part, which describes the physics below
some energy scale and so serves a good approximation in this domain.

The low-energy eﬀective action of N = 4 SYM theory plays an important role in
checking the AdS/CFT correspondence. According to [6], it can be matched with the
eﬀective action of a D3-brane propagating in the AdS5 background. This D3-brane ac-
tion can be understood as a Born-Infeld-type action possessing N = 4 superconformal
symmetry (see, e.g., [11]). This conjecture has been checked perturbatively, by comparing
the leading terms in the power series expansions of both these actions. We stress that the
veriﬁcation of this conjecture on the ﬁeld theory side is a very non-trivial task, since it
involves the computation of the quantum loop corrections to the low-energy eﬀective ac-
tion. To date, we have a good understanding of this issue in the one-loop approximation.
Only limited results are available beyond the one-loop order.

The signiﬁcant progress in exploring quantum aspects of N = 4 SYM theory has
been achieved due to the property that it possesses a reach set of symmetries which
are preserved in the quantum perturbation theory.
Indeed, this model, being a non-
trivial interacting quantum ﬁeld theory, respects the highest amount of supersymmetries
admissible in the four-dimensional Minkowski space. The supersymmetry is a part of
the P SU(2, 2|4) superconformal group that remains unbroken on the quantum level due
to the vanishing beta-function [2]. This symmetry imposes very strong constraints on
the quantum observables, such that some of them can be found exactly. The low-energy
eﬀective action is one of such objects. As we will demonstrate in the present paper, its
leading part is completely ﬁxed by the underlying (super)symmetries.

Within the perturbation theory one computes the eﬀective action as a series expansion

It is
over some small parameters, such as the coupling constants or Planck’s length.
advantageous to use the so-called derivative expansion, which assumes that the terms
with the lower number of derivatives on ﬁelds give the leading contribution in the low-
energy approximation, as compared to the terms with a larger number of derivatives. In
the present paper, we restrict our consideration only to the four-derivative terms in the
low-energy eﬀective action of N = 4 SYM theory. We will be interested in the eﬀective
action in the Coulomb branch, which describes the eﬀective dynamics of the massless
degrees of freedom. The remaining massive degrees of freedom appearing as a result of
spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry are assumed to be integrated out.

The studies of the four-derivative part of the N = 4 SYM eﬀective action were initiated
in the papers [12, 13], where the so-called F 4/X 4 term was analyzed. In these papers, it
was argued that the F 4/X 4 term in the N = 4 SYM eﬀective action is one-loop exact
and does not receive the instanton corrections. This term was also obtained by the direct
quantum computations using diﬀerent superspace methods [14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

Another interesting term in the four-derivative part of the N = 4 SYM eﬀective
action is the Wess-Zumino term for scalar ﬁelds [19]. Its presence is compulsory in order
to obey the anomaly-matching condition for the SU(4) R-symmetry [20]. Moreover, it has
a natural interpretation as the Chern-Simons term of the D3-brane action on the AdS5
background [19].

In the papers mentioned above only some selected terms in the four-derivative part
of the N = 4 SYM eﬀective action were found. Already in the ﬁrst papers [12, 13] it
was conjectured that the full four-derivative part of the eﬀective action can be restored
as a supersymmetric completion of these particular terms. However, the proof of this
statement turned out to be a very non-trivial exercise, and it was accomplished only in
the paper [21], based on the N = 2 harmonic superspace techniques [22, 23].
In the
subsequent papers [24, 25, 26], alternative descriptions of the four-derivative part of the
eﬀective action were developed in the framework of diﬀerent N = 3 and N = 4 harmonic
superspace approaches.

The basic aim of the present paper is to give a systematic and self-consistent review
of what has been done in [21, 24, 25, 26]. In the course of this consideration, we also give
the appropriate account of the related issues.

We point out that the four-derivative part of the eﬀective action constructed in [21,
24, 25, 26] is the exact result which was obtained solely on the ground of symmetries of the
theory, though the perturbative checks were performed afterwards in [27, 28, 29] (see also
[30] for a review). This exposes the exceptional role of the quantum N = 4 SYM theory
among other models of the quantum ﬁeld theory. We also emphasize that in the papers
just mentioned not only a superﬁeld generalization of the old results [12, 13] was obtained,

4

but also many important properties of the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action were
explained. In particular, the following questions were addressed: Why is the coeﬃcient
in front of the F 4/X 4-term one-loop exact? What is the origin of the Wess-Zumino term
in the low-energy eﬀective action? Why is the harmonic superspace approach so eﬃcient
for studying the eﬀective action and which harmonic superspace is most suitable for this
purpose? All these issues are thoroughly reviewed in the present paper.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we give a brief summary
of basic features of the low-energy eﬀective action in N = 4 SYM theory. A part of
this eﬀective action which is represented by the Wess-Zumino term for scalar ﬁelds is
discussed in detail in section 3. In particular, we explain the origin of the Wess-Zumino
term as the necessary consequence of the ‘t Hooft anomaly-matching condition for the

description of N = 4 SYM theory and construct its low-energy eﬀective action possessing
the full N = 4 supersymmetry. Section 5 is devoted to N = 3 SYM theory in the N = 3
harmonic superspace. This theory is known to be equivalent to N = 4 SYM on shell and
so provides the maximally supersymmetric oﬀ-shell formulation of the latter. For this
N = 3 SYM theory we construct the N = 3 superconformal low-energy eﬀective action
and consider its component ﬁeld structure in the sector of bosonic ﬁelds. In sections 6 and
7 we elaborate on two diﬀerent N = 4 harmonic superspaces which appear very suitable
for description of the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action. We demonstrate that the
latter acquires especially simple form in these superspaces. In the last section we discuss
some issues and open problems related to the study of the low-energy eﬀective action in
N = 4 SYM theory beyond the leading low-energy approximation.

The N = 4 gauge supermultiplet consists of one vector gauge ﬁeld Am, four spinor ﬁelds
α, ¯ψ ˙αI and six scalar ﬁelds ϕIJ = −ϕJI , where I = 1, 2, 3, 4 is the quartet index of
ψI
the R-symmetry SU(4) group. The spinor ﬁelds are in the conjugated non-equivalent
fundamental representations 4 and 4 of SU(4) , while the scalar ﬁelds are in the real
representation 6, since they obey the reality condition

case, all these ﬁelds are sitting in the adjoint representation of some gauge group G. They

This potential reaches its minimum V = 0 for the ﬁelds valued in the Cartan subalgebra

Hence, at non-trivial vacuum expectation values (vevs) of these ﬁelds,

the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry becomes possible. The details of gauge
symmetry breaking in N = 4 SYM theory are presented in [31]. Assuming that the gauge
group in N = 4 SYM is G = SU(N),3 the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking
can be summarized as follows:

• In general, the gauge group G = SU(N) is broken down to H = [U(1)]N −1 , which
is the maximal abelian subgroup of SU(N). However, also a larger subgroup of
the gauge group may remain unbroken, when not all of the scalars from h acquire
non-vanishing vevs. To simplify the issue, in what follows we will basically assume
that H = [U(1)]N −1 and, even more, that the gauge group G is SU(2) which can
be broken down only to H = U(1).

• After the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the ﬁelds (ϕIJ, Am, ψI

α, ¯ψ ˙αI)h from
the Cartan subalgebra h remain massless, while the ﬁelds corresponding to the coset
space G/H acquire masses speciﬁed by the vacuum values aIJ . These G/H ﬁelds
realize the massive representation of N = 4 superalgebra with the central charges
which are identiﬁed with some U(1) generators from the subalgebra h, times the
parameters aIJ . Since such central charges are vanishing on the massless ﬁelds
α, ¯ψ ˙αI)h, the latter form a supermultiplet of the standard N = 4 super-
(ϕIJ, Am, ψI
symmetry.

• The N = 4 supersymmetry itself remains unbroken whatever G and H are, while its
R-symmetry SU(4) ≃ SO(6) proves spontaneously broken down to some subgroup

3Other gauge groups can be considered as well.

of SU(4). In the case of G = SU(2), H = U(1), this subgroup is SO(5) ≃ USp(4) .
The full-ﬂedged N = 4 superalgebra with central charges, because of the presence of
SU(4) breaking constants aIJ in the right-hand sides of the basic anticommutators,
possesses the reduced R-symmetry group SO(5) ≃ USp(4). With respect to this
USp(4), the N = 4 massive vector multiplet comprises ﬁve complex scalars in the
representation 5, one complex singlet massive vector and four Dirac spinors in the
representation 4 of USp(4) .4

• The R-symmetry SO(6) ≃ SU(4) is spontaneously broken down to SO(5) ≃ USp(4)
also in the sector of massless ﬁelds, though in this case no central charges in the
N = 4 superalgebra are present, and so no reduction of the R-symmetry group comes
about. The eﬀect of spontaneous breaking consists in that the vacuum expectation
values aIJ of the scalar ﬁelds are invariant only under the group SO(5). This means
that the SU(4) transformations of the physical scalars φIJ
h − aIJ acquire
inhomogeneous terms (shifts), so ﬁve ﬁelds out of these massless scalars can be
interpreted as the SO(6)/SO(5) Goldstone ﬁelds. It is worth pointing out that the
model is still invariant under the full R-symmetry group SU(4), but the latter is
now realized on the scalar ﬁelds by the inhomogeneous transformations.

h = ϕIJ

α, ¯ψ ˙αI)h.

• The original classical action (2.3) is known to be invariant under the superconformal
group P SU(2, 2|4) involving SU(4) as a subgroup. This extended symmetry is
also spontaneously broken and is realized by inhomogeneous transformations of the
ﬁelds (ϕIJ , Am, ψI
In particular, one ﬁeld out of six massless scalars is a
dilaton (apart from the remaining ﬁve SU(4)/O(5) Goldstone ﬁelds). Also, the
α, ¯ψ ˙αI)h as the
conformal N = 4 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, with (ψI
corresponding goldstini. To avoid a possible confusion, we note that P SU(2, 2|4) is
in fact the symmetry group of the whole eﬀective action, including its part spanned
by the massive G/H ﬁelds, and this is preserved at the quantum level due to the
vanishing beta-function. However, the realization of the superconformal symmetry
on the G/H ﬁelds is rather complicated since the corresponding transformations are
accompanied by some ﬁeld-dependent gauge transformations and their Lie brackets
contain operator central charges. The correct closure of P SU(2, 2|4) symmetry, like
4For the simplest case of gauge group SU (2) broken to U (1) there is only one central charge pro-
portional to the U (1) generator and only one set of the SU (4)R breaking parameters aIJ , giving rise
just to SO(5) ≃ U Sp(4) as the reduced R-symmetry.
In the more general case of G = SU (N ) and
H = [U (1)]N −1, more central charges can appear, with diﬀerent sets of SU (4)R breaking constants. If
these constant SO(6) vectors are collinear, the reduced R-symmetry is still U Sp(4) and the relevant mas-
sive supermultiplets have the same U Sp(4) contents, while their number is 1
2 N (N − 1). If the breaking
constant vectors are arbitrary, the further reduction of the original SO(6) ≃ SU (4) R-symmetry occurs.

that of the N = 4 supersymmetry, is achieved only on shell.

As a brief resume, the crucial feature of the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking in
N = 4 SYM theory is the appearance of massive multiplets which correspond to broken
directions G/H in the gauge group G , while the degrees of freedom corresponding to H
remain massless. At low energies, we can observe only these massless ﬁelds, with the
dynamics described by some low-energy eﬀective action. In quantum ﬁeld theory, in order
to obtain this low-energy eﬀective action, one has to integrate out the massive ﬁelds in
the functional integral which deﬁnes the full eﬀective action.
In the present paper we
do not engage with technical details of this functional integration, but rather discuss the
general structure of the resulting expression for the low-energy eﬀective action of N = 4
SYM theory. Needless to say, this low-energy eﬀective action describes N = 4 SYM in
the Coulomb branch. In the present paper we denote it by Γ.

2.2 Low-energy eﬀective action: Derivative expansion

The computation of low-energy eﬀective action in quantum ﬁeld theory is, in general, a
complicated problem which is usually approached by perturbative methods, assuming the
series expansion of the eﬀective action with respect to some small parameters like the
Planck length or coupling constants. The derivative expansion of the eﬀective action can
also be considered as one of the perturbative methods, which relies upon the common
observation that the ﬁelds with long wavelengths at low energies dominate over the ﬁelds
with short wavelengths. It is frequently a good approximation to discard the ﬁelds with
short wavelengths which are represented in the eﬀective action by terms with higher num-
ber of space-time derivatives, as compared to the terms with lower number of derivatives.
The latter terms involve the ﬁelds with longer wavelengths.

To illustrate these ideas, let us consider the eﬀective action for one scalar ﬁeld φ. The

derivative expansion of the eﬀective action can be schematically represented as

Γ =

∞Xn=0

Γ2n ,

(2.10)

where Γ2n is a functional which involves just 2n space-time derivatives of φ. In particular,
Γ0 contains no derivatives of φ and so corresponds to the (eﬀective) potential for the

scalar ﬁeld Γ0 = −R d4x V (φ). The functional Γ2 has two space-time derivatives of the

scalar ﬁeld and corresponds to a ﬁnite (or inﬁnite) renormalization of the wavefunction, if
the latter receives perturbative quantum corrections. The next term is Γ4 which involves
four derivatives of the scalar and represents the leading non-trivial quantum correction
to the eﬀective action. The remaining terms, starting with Γ6 , must be considered as the
higher-order corrections to the low-energy approximation.

9

The derivative expansion of the eﬀective action straightforwardly applies to N = 4
SYM theory. We will count the derivative degree of diﬀerent terms in the eﬀective action
just with respect to the scalar ﬁelds. This means that, after turning oﬀ the vector and
spinor ﬁelds, the term Γ2n in the eﬀective action contains as the remainder exactly 2n
space-time derivatives of scalars ϕIJ . It is important to note that the omitted terms with
vector and spinor ﬁelds can be uniquely restored from the terms with scalar ﬁelds only.
Indeed, it is obvious that N = 4 supersymmetry does not mix those terms in the eﬀective
action which contain diﬀerent numbers of derivatives.

It is well known that in N = 4 SYM theory there are no quantum corrections to
the classical scalar potential (2.7), i.e. Γ0 = 0. Since the eﬀective action in N = 4 SYM
theory is UV ﬁnite [2, 3, 4],5 no wave-function renormalization is needed and so Γ2 = Sfree ,
where Sfree = S|g=0 is that part of the N = 4 SYM action (2.3) which contains the kinetic
terms of the N = 4 multiplet. The ﬁrst non-trivial quantum correction in the eﬀective
action starts with Γ4, which will be the basic object of study in the present paper. The
higher-order terms, starting with Γ6, will fall beyond our consideration.

To summarize, in the present paper we will study the low-energy eﬀective action of
N = 4 SYM theory in the Coulomb branch. More precisely, we will be interested only
in that part of this low-energy eﬀective action, which contains, in its component ﬁeld
expansion, no more than four space-time derivatives of scalar ﬁelds (together with other
appropriate terms which involve vector and spinor ﬁelds and are needed for completing
the scalar ﬁeld terms to the invariants of N = 4 supersymmetry).

2.3 Wess-Zumino vs. F 4/X 4 term in the low-energy eﬀective

action

In this section we will consider the gauge group G = SU(2) spontaneously broken down
to H = U(1). In this case the low-energy eﬀective action is dominated by one massless
N = 4 vector multiplet which consists of six scalar ﬁelds XA, four spinors ψI
α and one
abelian vector ﬁeld Am with the ﬁeld strength Fmn = ∂mAn − ∂nAm.

The leading four-derivative quantum correction to the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective

action is known to contain, among its components, the so-called F 4/X 4 term [12, 13]

It was argued that this part of the eﬀective action is one-loop exact [12, 32] and does not
receive non-perturbative corrections [34]. This F 4/X 4 term appears as one of the terms

5The proof of the non-renormalization theorem in the N = 2 harmonic superspace was given in [32, 33].

Here, Λ is some parameter of dimension one the dependence on which completely dis-
appears after passing to the component form of the eﬀective action. The details of the
construction of the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action in N = 2 superspace will be
discussed in sect. 4. It is important to mention that the non-holomorphic eﬀective po-
tential (2.12) was derived perturbatively in [14, 15], using the N = 1 superﬁeld methods
and, later, in [16] and [17, 18] with the use of N = 2 projective and harmonic superspace
techniques, respectively.

Another interesting term in the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action is the so-called

Wess-Zumino term which involves the scalar ﬁelds only [19, 20]:

1

−

1

|X|6 XA∂M XB∂N XC∂KXD∂LXE∂P XF ,

(2.13)

where |X|2 = XAXA. Here it is presented in the form of the integral over a ﬁve-
dimensional space-time, but it can always be rewritten as a functional in the conventional
four-dimensional Minkowski space, since the integrand in (2.13) is a closed ﬁve-form. We
will show in sect. 3 that there are various four-dimensional representations of the same
Wess-Zumino term (2.13). They prove to be good starting points for construction of the
superﬁeld low-energy eﬀective actions in various harmonic superspaces. Here it is impor-
tant to note that the coeﬃcient − 1
60π2 in front of this action is exact and, for topological
reasons, can only be a multiple of an integer (see, e.g., [36, 37]).

It will be demonstrated in sect. 3 that the four-dimensional form of the Wess-Zumino
term (2.13) contains four space-time derivatives of scalar ﬁelds. Thus it is one of the terms
in the four-derivative part of the full low-energy N = 4 SYM eﬀective action Γ4. Recall
that the term (2.11) also belongs to Γ4 , since each Maxwell ﬁeld strength in it involves
one space-time derivative. Thus, these two terms should be related to each other by the
abelian version of the N = 4 supersymmetry transformations (2.6).

In practice, to check this suggestion, i.e. to prove that (2.11) and (2.13) are indeed
related to each other by the abelian version of the N = 4 supersymmetry (2.6), is a
rather diﬃcult task since, apart from (2.11) and (2.13), Γ4 contains a lot of other terms
α, ¯ψ ˙αI ﬁelds of the N = 4 vector
depending on the bosonic XA, Am and the fermionic ψI
multiplet. Recovering all these terms in the eﬀective action is an extremely involved
routine, unless one uses the superspace techniques. One of the aims of the present paper is
to demonstrate that the solution to this problem indeed becomes trivial in the appropriate

11

superﬁeld approaches based on extended superspaces. We will show that the two terms
(2.11) and (2.13) originate from the same N = 4 superﬁeld expressions, for which reason
the coeﬃcients in front of them prove to be ﬁrmly related.

This property has an important consequence: The whole four-derivative part Γ4 of the
low-energy eﬀective action in the N = 4 SYM action can be found without performing
any perturbative computation. All what we need to know is that this part contains the
Wess-Zumino term (2.13) the form of which is unique and, moreover, the coeﬃcient in
front of it is ﬁxed by topological reasons. Then, all other component terms in Γ4 can be
found by applying the N = 4 supersymmetry transformations. Just in this sense, the
four-derivative part of the N = 4 SYM eﬀective action is exact.

2.4 Low-energy eﬀective action: Why harmonic superspace?

Finding the totally N = 4 supersymmetric completion of the terms (2.11) and (2.13)
is a non-trivial problem which has never been solved in the standard component ﬁeld
formulation of N = 4 SYM theory. It is natural to expect that the superﬁeld approaches
can be useful for solving this problem, since they display the manifest supersymmetry.
In principle, it is possible to use diﬀerent superspaces with 1 ≤ N ≤ 4 supersymmetries.
Each of them has some speciﬁc useful features which we will discuss in this section.

The simplest and the most developed approach is based on the standard N = 1
superspace, which is described in details, e.g., in the books [38, 39]. In terms of N = 1
superﬁelds, the N = 4 gauge multiplet is represented by a triplet of chiral superﬁelds ΦI,
I = 1, 2, 3, and a real gauge superﬁeld V with the chiral superﬁeld strength Wα. The
general N = 1 superspace action (including various pieces of the eﬀective action) has the
following form

S =Z d4xd4θ L +Z d4xd2θ Lc +Z d4xd2 ¯θ ¯Lc .

(2.14)
Here, the Lagrangian L is given on the full N = 1 superspace, while Lc and ¯Lc are,
respectively, the chiral superspace Lagrangian and its complex conjugate. The superﬁeld
action can be rewritten in the component form, using the identities

Z d4xd4θ L =

1

16Z d4x D2 ¯D2L|θ=0 ,

Z d4xd2θ Lc =

1

4Z d4x D2L|θ=0 ,

(2.15)

where D2 = DαDα, ¯D2 = ¯D ˙α ¯D ˙α , and Dα, ¯D ˙α are covariant spinor derivatives which obey
the anticommutation relations

{Dα, ¯D ˙α} = −2iσm

α ˙α∂m .

(2.16)

The relations (2.15) and (2.16) imply that the full superspace integration measure ensures
two space-time derivatives in the component ﬁeld action.

12

When using the N = 1 superspace to describe the four-derivative part Γ4 of the
eﬀective action, one has to deal with a superﬁeld Lagrangian L which depends on three
chiral superﬁelds ΦI and N = 1 superﬁeld strength Wα (and their conjugates). One of
the terms in Γ4 has the form

Z d4xd4θ

(ΦI ¯ΦI )2

∝Z d4x

1

(XAXA)2hFmnF nkFklF lm −

1
4

(FpqF pq)2i.

(2.17)

The terms with pure (anti)chiral superﬁelds, which complete (2.17) by N = 4 supersym-
metry, involve four covariant spinor derivatives Dα and ¯D ˙α that generate, after passing
to the component ﬁelds, two more space-time derivatives besides the two already brought
by the full superspace integration measure. There is plenty of such terms, and it ap-
pears diﬃcult to ﬁnd the fully N = 4 supersymmetric completion of (2.17). Thus this
problem does not seem to be simpler than the previously discussed purely component
construction in the standard Minkowski space. Note that the solution of this problem in
the N = 1 superspace has never been presented in the fully N = 4 supersymmetric and
SU(4) invariant form.

Let us now consider the N = 2 superspace with Grassmann coordinates θα

i and ¯θi
˙α,
i = 1, 2. The superspace integration measure in the full N = 2 superspace eﬀectively
contains eight covariant spinor derivatives,

Z d4xd8θ L ∝Z d4x(D1)2( ¯D1)2(D2)2( ¯D2)2L|θ=0 ,

(2.18)

which gives rise to four space-time derivatives in the component ﬁeld Lagrangian owing
to the anticommutation relations

{Di

α, ¯Dj ˙α} = −2iδi

jσm

α ˙α∂m .

(2.19)

Thus the N = 2 superspace is most appropriate for the description of the four-derivative
part of the eﬀective action Γ4 , because the corresponding superﬁeld Lagrangian L must
be a function of just N = 2 superﬁelds without any derivatives on them. This enormously
simpliﬁes the problem of construction of the low-energy eﬀective action Γ4 in N = 4 SYM
theory. The fully N = 4 supersymmetric expression for Γ4 in the N = 2 superspace was
presented in [21]. We will review the details of this action in sect. 4.

When N = 4 SYM theory is formulated in the N = 2 superspace, N = 2 super-
symmetry is realized manifestly and oﬀ the mass shell, while the extra (hidden) N = 2
supersymmetry is realized by transformations which mix diﬀerent N = 2 superﬁelds and
possess the correct closure only on the mass shell. It is important to note that the oﬀ-
shell realizations of matter hypermultiplets and gauge multiplets in the N = 2 superspace
require special techniques such as the harmonic superspace [22, 23, 40] or the projective

13

superspace [41, 42, 43]. These two approaches provide elegant and natural descriptions
of ﬁeld theories with extended supersymmetry. In fact, they have much in common and
are related to each other [44]. Nevertheless, as regards the quantum calculations, the
harmonic superspace approach is much more elaborated (see, e.g., [45]). Just for this rea-
son we prefer to employ it while studying the low-energy eﬀective action in N = 4 SYM
theory. As we will show in subsequent sections, there are in fact a few N = 4 harmonic
superspaces which provide very simple and nice expressions for Γ4.

It is known that the N = 3 and N = 4 SYM models are equivalent on the mass
shell [45]. This is also true for their low-energy eﬀective actions. The amazing feature of
N = 3 SYM theory is that it admits an oﬀ-shell N = 3 superﬁeld formulation [46, 47].
This formulation is based on N = 3 harmonic superspace with SU(3) harmonic variables.
Thus, it is natural to fulﬁll the study of the N = 3 SYM low-energy eﬀective action,
employing the techniques of the N = 3 harmonic superspace. The expression for Γ4 in
the N = 3 harmonic superspace was found in [26]. This construction will be reviewed in
sect. 5.

3 Various forms of the Wess-Zumino term for scalar

ﬁelds

The Wess-Zumino term for scalar ﬁelds in the N = 4 SYM action (2.13) is represented
by the ﬁve-dimensional integral of the exact ﬁve-form with explicit SO(6) symmetry.
Using the Stokes theorem this expression can always be represented in the form of four-
dimensional integral which is implicitly invariant under SO(6). As we will show, there
are several four-dimensional representations of this term which diﬀer in the manifestly
realized subgroups of the full R-symmetry group SO(6). All these forms naturally appear
in diﬀerent superﬁeld formulations of the low-energy N = 4 SYM eﬀective action.

We will start with a d-dimensional generalization of (2.13) and further present the
results for the particular d = 4 case. The material of this section is essentially based on
the papers [24, 25, 26].

3.1 SO(d + 2)-invariant Wess-Zumino term

Let us consider d+2 scalar ﬁelds XA, A = 1, . . . , d+2 , in the d+1-dimensional Minkowski
space. For XAXA 6= 0 we can introduce the normalized scalars YA

YA =

(3.4)

Here ΩY is a hemisphere in Sd+1 whose boundary, ∂ΩY , is the image of the d-dimensional
space-time, viewed as a large Sd, under the map YA(x) [48, 49]. For any integer N,
choosing another hemisphere shifts S(d)

WZ by 2π × an integer.

Let us now split the index A into a = 1, . . . , n and a′ = n + 1, . . . n + m, where we
deﬁned m = d + 2− n. With the normalization ε1...(n+m) = ε1...nεn+1...n+m, we can rewrite
(3.3) in the more unfolded form

obtain the d-dimensional form of the Wess-Zumino term with manifest SO(n) × SO(m)

Note that the group SO(3)×SO(3) is locally isomorphic to SU(2)×SU(2). Therefore,
as we will see in sect. 7.4.2, the Wess-Zumino term in the form (3.22) appears as a
component in the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action in the bi-harmonic N = 4
superspace.

3.5 Wess-Zumino term and SU (3) symmetry

The Lie group SO(6) ≃ SU(4) has the following maximal subgroups:8 SO(5), SO(4) ×
SO(2), SO(3) × SO(3) and SU(3) × U(1). In the previous sections we considered three
diﬀerent forms of the Wess-Zumino term which correspond to the ﬁrst three subgroups:
SO(5), SO(4) × SO(2) and SO(3) × SO(3). It remains to consider the last possibility
8By deﬁnition, the subgroup H of a group G is called maximal if there is no other proper subgroup
of G that contains H. Note that this deﬁnition does not assume that the maximal subgroup is unique,
unless additional conditions are imposed.

18

related to SU(3) × U(1). As we will show here, in contrast to the former cases this
symmetry group does not admit a manifest realization in the four-dimensional form of
the Wess-Zumino term.

We start with the SO(6) covariant Wess-Zumino term (2.13) and rewrite it in the form
with the explicit SU(3) symmetry. To this end, using six real scalars Y A, we construct
three complex SU(3) triplet scalars f i, i = 1, 2, 3, as

f 1 = Y 1 + iY 2 ,
¯f1 = Y 1 − iY 2 ,

f 2 = Y 3 + iY 4 ,
¯f2 = Y 3 − iY 4 ,

f 3 = Y 5 + iY 6 ,
¯f3 = Y 5 − iY 6 .

Like Y A, the scalars f i take values on the ﬁve-sphere with the unit radius

f i ¯fi = 1 .

(3.28)

(3.29)

In terms of these complex scalars the Wess-Zumino action (2.13) exhibits manifest SU(3)
symmetry:

Let us introduce the following 2-forms

¯ω2 = εijk ¯fid ¯fj ∧ d ¯fk .
In terms of these forms the action (3.30) acquires the concise form

ω2 = εijkf idf j ∧ df k ,

SWZ =

(dω2 ∧ ¯ω2 − ω2 ∧ d¯ω2) .

It is easy to check that this action is real.

The equation (3.29) has the obvious corollary

df i ¯fi + f id ¯fi = 0 .

As a consequence, the diﬀerential forms (3.31) obey the important constraint

or

ω2 ∧ d¯ω2 = −dω2 ∧ ¯ω2 ,

d(ω2 ∧ ¯ω2) = 0 .

Using this relation, the action (3.32) cab be cast in the form

Let us express the action (3.41) in terms of the scalars (3.28)

It is important to note that the constants ci break the manifest SU(3) symmetry.
Nevertheless, it is possible to show that under the SU(3) transformations of the scalars
the Lagrangian in (3.44) is shifted by a total space-time derivative, so that the action
enjoys a non-manifest SU(3) invariance (and in fact SO(6) invariance as well, since we
started from the covariant action (2.13)). This is a speciﬁc feature of the subgroup
SU(3) of SU(4) as compared to the other maximal subgroups SO(5), SO(4)× SO(2) and
SO(3) × SO(3).

3.6 The origin of the Wess-Zumino term

One can wonder why the case of the group SU(3) × U(1) is so diﬀerent from the cases of
other maximal subgroups of SO(6) considered in this section. To answer this question,
we have to recall the origin of the Wess-Zumino terms in the low-energy eﬀective actions.
The appearance of Wess-Zumino terms in low-energy quantum eﬀective actions is re-
lated to chiral anomalies of the global (“ﬂavor”) symmetries [50, 48]. In a four-dimensional
gauge theory, with the gauge group Gg and the global symmetry group Ggl, the anomaly
with respect to Ggl can be generated in a ‘global-gauge-gauge’ or a ‘global-global-global’
triangle diagram.
In the former case, the global symmetry is broken at the quantum
level: The Noether current of Ggl is not conserved and the quantum eﬀective action has
a non-zero variation under Ggl. However, if only the ‘global-global-global’ diagram is
anomalous, Ggl is not broken at the quantum level: The Ggl current is conserved and
the eﬀective action is invariant. Yet, the anomaly manifests itself in the presence of the
Wess-Zumino term in the quantum eﬀective action, and the necessity of such a term can
be understood on the basis of the ’t Hooft anomaly-matching condition [51, 52].

It is pertinent to recall what the ’t Hooft anomaly-matching argument is. Consider a
model which involves chiral fermions interacting with the gauge ﬁelds corresponding to
a gauge symmetry Gg spontaneously broken down to Hg ⊂ Gg by means of the Higgs
mechanism. Assume that there is a quantum anomaly of this gauge symmetry.
If we
integrate out, in the functional integral, some number of ﬁelds (including chiral fermions)
which have become massive due to the Higgs mechanism, we obtain an eﬀective theory
for the remaining light ﬁelds. One may think that the contribution to the anomaly in the
eﬀective theory changes due to a fewer number of the remaining chiral fermions. However,
the anomaly is known to be exact and so should have the same strength in the eﬀective
theory, when part of chiral ﬁelds has been integrated out. It cannot depend on any scalar
ﬁeld vacuum values which trigger spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry and/or masses
of the heavy ﬁelds and so must preserve its form in any branch of the theory. Respectively,
the missing contribution to the anomaly in the eﬀective theory is accounted for just by
the Wess-Zumino terms for Goldstone bosons which appear in the process of spontaneous
gauge symmetry breaking, and this is the essence of the ’t Hooft anomaly-matching con-
dition. If the chiral fermions belong to the adjoint representation of the anomalous gauge
group, like the gauge ﬁelds, the coeﬃcients in front of the directly calculated anomalies
in the original and eﬀective theories are dimG and dimH, respectively (up to the same
overall numerical coeﬃcient). Then the coeﬃcient in the Wess-Zumino term should be
proportional to (dimGg − dimHg). This coeﬃcient coincides with the number of chiral
fermions which acquired mass due to the Higgs mechanism and do not show up in the
eﬀective theory. The Gg variation of such a Wess-Zumino term makes the precisely same

21

contribution to the anomalous current as the missed fermions [48, 53].

To summarize, the quantum eﬀective action of the light ﬁelds in the theories with the
heavy ﬁelds integrated out should necessarily involve the Wess-Zumino term with a ﬁxed
coeﬃcient, and it can be directly found by the explicit quantum calculations (see, e.g.,
[19]). The real virtue of the ’t Hooft anomaly-matching argument is that in fact there is
no need to make such calculations in order to uncover this Wess-Zumino term.

It is important to realize that the ’t Hooft anomaly-matching argument can be also
successfully applied to ﬁnd the Wess-Zumino term in the eﬀective theory, when the global
symmetries are anomalous, rather than the local gauge symmetry.
Indeed, if we have
some global symmetry with the group Ggl we can formally make it local by introducing
external gauge ﬁelds which couple to the corresponding Noether currents. Then, if Ggl
is potentially anomalous, i.e. there are chiral fermions in the theory, after the gauging
just mentioned there will explicitly appear the anomaly proportional to the number of
these chiral fermions. If Ggl is spontaneously broken, the above arguments are applicable
and we ﬁnd out the Wess-Zumino term in the eﬀective theory, such that it remains non-
vanishing even after switching oﬀ the background gauge ﬁeld and coming back to the
original case with Ggl acting as the global symmetry. Thus it should be present in the
eﬀective action of the corresponding light ﬁelds prior to any gauging. The coeﬃcient in
front of such Wess-Zumino term should be proportional to the number of chiral fermions
which are missing in the eﬀective theory.

This is precisely what happens in N = 4 SYM theory which has the global SU(4)
R-symmetry with anomalous ‘global-global-global’ diagram [54]. With respect to this R-
α and ¯ψ ˙αI
symmetry, N = 4 SYM is a chiral theory, because the left and right gauginos ψI
belong to the representations 4 and 4 which are not equivalent to each other.9 When the
gauge group Gg is spontaneously broken down to a subgroup Hg, and the (dim Gg−dimHg)
massive gauginos are integrated out, the Wess-Zumino term [19] appears in the eﬀective
action, with the coeﬃcient proportional to (dim Gg−dimHg) , so that the ’t Hooft anomaly
matching condition is satisﬁed [52, 20]. Since the scalar ﬁelds which receive the vacuum
expectation values are in the adjoint of Gg, the unbroken group Hg necessarily includes
an U(1) subgroup, and, as a result, the theory “sits” on the Coulomb branch.

At this point it is important to note that, though the N = 4 SYM theory in ﬂat
Minkowski space is ﬁnite and free of anomalies, this ceases to be true when it couples
to N = 4 conformal supergravity [55, 56]. In the latter case there is one-loop quantum
anomaly of the local superconformal symmetry P SU(2, 2|4) which contains SU(4)R as a
subgroup. The N = 4 conformal supergravity multiplet involves vector ﬁelds which couple
9This has to be contrasted with the gauge group, with respect to which both gauginos belong to the

same adjoint representation and so cannot produce any anomaly.

22

to the SU(4)R Noether currents of N = 4 SYM theory. These vector ﬁelds give the origin
of the Wess-Zumino term in the N = 4 SYM eﬀective action, according to the ’t Hooft
anomaly-matching argument. The Wess-Zumino term survives upon switching oﬀ the
supergravity ﬁelds and plays an important role in securing the rigid N = 4 supersymmetry
(and conformal supersymmetry) of the N = 4 SYM eﬀective action in the ﬂat Minkowski
space.

As we have shown in this section, in order to write the Wess-Zumino term (2.13)
as a four-dimensional integral one is forced to sacriﬁce part of the manifest SO(6) R-
symmetry. The ’t Hooft anomaly-matching argument [51, 52] tells us that all anomalous
R-symmetry generators must transform the four-dimensional Wess-Zumino term into a
total divergence, and therefore anomalous R-symmetry subgroups cannot be made man-
ifest. On the other hand, with respect to the non-anomalous subgroups of SO(6) (for
which left and right fermions are transformed by the same representation) the density of
the Wess-Zumino term should reveal a manifest invariance.

Recall that the spinor ﬁelds of the N = 4 SYM supermultiplet carry the representation
4 + 4 of SU(4). This representation splits into the following representations of the four
maximal subgroups of SO(6) ≃ SU(4) (we write this splitting only for the 4 part):

SU(3) × U(1),

SO(5) ≃ USp(4),

SO(4) × SO(2) ≃ SU(2) × SU(2) × U(1),
SO(3) × SO(3) ≃ SU(2) × SU(2),

4 = 3+1 + 1−3
4 = 4
4 = (2, 1)+1 + (1, 2)−1
4 = (2, 2) .

(3.45)

The ﬁrst subgroup is anomalous, whereas the other three are non-anomalous. The
anomaly is absent for the USp(4) and SU(2) × SU(2) subgroups because the multi-
plets 4 of USp(4) and 2 of SU(2) are equivalent to the conjugated ones. The potential
U(1) anomaly for the SU(2)× SU(2)× U(1) subgroup cancels due to the symmetric U(1)
charge assignments of 4 = (2, 1)+1 + (1, 2)−1. Thus only symmetries under these non-
anomalous subgroups can be made manifest in the four-dimensional representation of the
Wess-Zumino term. The SU(3) group, being anomalous, cannot be made manifest. This
is exactly what we see in the action (3.44), which involves the constant triplet ci which
explicitly breaks the manifest SU(3) symmetry.

In the next sections we will show that the Wess-Zumino terms with SO(5) and SO(3)×
SO(3) manifest symmetry naturally appear from formulations of the N = 4 SYM eﬀective
action in the N = 4 harmonic superspaces with USp(4) and SU(2) × SU(2) harmonic
variables. The SO(4) × SO(2) form of the Wess-Zumino term is inherent to the N = 2
harmonic superspace formulation of N = 4 SYM theory. The Wess-Zumino term in the
form (3.44) originates from the N = 3 SYM low-energy eﬀective action in the N = 3
It is worth pointing out in advance that all these Wess-Zumino

23

terms are generated by the superﬁeld expressions for N = 4 SYM eﬀective action which
are almost uniquely, up to an overall constant, determined by the requirements of N = 4
supersymmetry and/or superconformal P SU(2, 2|4) symmetry, without any need in the
explicit perturbative calculations. The overall coeﬃcient is further ﬁxed by the purely
topological reasoning, since it multiplies the component Wess-Zumino term.

4 Low-energy eﬀective action in N = 2 harmonic

superspace

In this section we construct the low-energy eﬀective action in N = 4 SYM theory in
terms of superﬁelds given on the N = 2 harmonic superspace. The exposition in this
section is essentially based on the results of the paper [21]. To make the consideration
more pedagogical we start with a brief review of the basic concepts of the N = 2 har-
monic superspace which was originally introduced in [23]. The detailed description of the
principles of the harmonic superspace is given in the book [45].

4.1 Brief review of N = 2 harmonic superspace
The N -extended Minkowski superspace is parametrized by the coordinates

zM = (xm, θα

i , ¯θ ˙αi) ,

(4.1)

where xm, m = 0, 1, 2, 3, are the Minkowski space coordinates, while θα
i and their conju-
gate ¯θ ˙αi = θα
i , i = 1, 2, . . . ,N , α, ˙α = 1, 2, are the anticommuting Grassmann coordinates.
In this superspace, N -extended Poincar´e supersymmetry is realized by the following in-
ﬁnitesimal coordinate transformations

δθα

i = ǫα
i ,

δ ¯θ ˙αi = ¯ǫ ˙αi ,

δxm = i(ǫiσm ¯θi − θiσm¯ǫi) .

(4.2)

The generators of these transformations as diﬀerential operators on the superspace can
be chosen in the form

(4.5)

The above formulas are valid for any N . In the rest of this section we will consider
the particular case N = 2, with the indices i, j = 1, 2 corresponding to the automorphism
SU(2) group.

By deﬁnition, the harmonic superspace, besides the familiar coordinates (4.1), contains
additional bosonic coordinates u±
i which parametrize the SU(2) group manifold. These
extra bosonic coordinates (harmonics) can be viewed as the unitary matrices which obey
the following deﬁning property

u+iu−

j − u−iu+

j = δi
j .

The rule of complex conjugation for them is

i = u−i .
u+

(4.6)

(4.7)

The harmonics carry the indices ± which denote their U(1) charges. We allow the super-
ﬁelds to be functions on the SU(2) group, Φ = Φ(z, u). In what follows we will consider
only those superﬁelds which are represented by the harmonic series with the deﬁnite U(1)
charges

Φ(q)(z, u) =

ϕ(i1...in+qj1...jn)(z)u+

i1 . . . u+

in+qu−

j1 . . . u−
jn .

(4.8)

∞Xn=0

The coeﬃcients of this harmonic expansion, ϕ(i1...in+qj1...jn)(z), are the conventional N = 2
superﬁelds which carry the external SU(2) spin s, such that 2s = |2n + q|. This means
that the superﬁelds Φ(q)(z, u) are functions on the two-sphere S2 = SU(2)/U(1) rather
than on the full SU(2). The series (4.8) is nothing else than the expansion over spherical
harmonics on S2.

One can deﬁne three independent covariant derivatives,

∂++ = u+i ∂

∂u−i ,

∂−− = u−i ∂

∂u+i ,

∂0 = u+i ∂

∂u+i − u−i ∂

∂u−i ,

which obey the commutation relations of the Lie algebra su(2)

[∂++, ∂−−] = ∂0 ,

[∂0, ∂−−] = −2∂−− .
It is easy to see that the derivative ∂0 counts the U(1) charge of superﬁelds

[∂0, ∂++] = 2∂++ ,

∂0Φ(q) = qΦ(q) .

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

Using the harmonic variables, we can deﬁne the U(1) projections of the Grassmann

variables and covariant spinor derivatives

Projecting the anticommutation relations (4.5) for N = 2 on the harmonics, we observe
that the derivatives D+

α and ¯D+

˙α form the mutually anticommuting set
β } = { ¯D+
while the non-trivial anticommutators are

˙β } = {D+

˙β } = 0 ,

α , D+

α , ¯D+

α , ¯D+

{D−

˙α} = −{D+

˙α} = 2iσm

α ˙α∂m .

These anticommutation relations are completely equivalent to the N = 2 case of the
algebra (4.5).

The rules of (complex) conjugation in the harmonic superspace deserve some com-
ments. First of all, it should be noted that the standard complex conjugation is not
suitable since it maps the superﬁeld of the charge q into the superﬁeld of the charge −q ,
(4.16)

Φ(q)(z, u) = Φ(−q)(z, u) .

Thus it seems impossible to deﬁne a real superﬁeld in the harmonic superspace, unless
q 6= 0. It turns out, however, that in the harmonic superspace there exists a generalized

conjugation “e ” which does not change the harmonic U(1) charge and allows to deﬁne the

appropriate reality conditions. By deﬁnition [23], its action on the harmonic-independent
superﬁelds coincides with the conventional complex conjugation

^ϕi1...in(z) = ¯ϕi1...in(z) ,

while its action on the harmonics is postulated to be

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

i = u±i ,

α = ¯θ±
˙α ,

fu±
fθ±

i .

fu±i = −u±
f¯θ±
˙α = −θ±
α .

Using these rules, it is easy to see that the generalized conjugation acts on the Grassmann
variables (4.12) as

The properties (4.18) and (4.19) show that the operatione is rather a pseudo-conjugation,

since it squares to −1 on the objects with odd charge q:

^^
Φ(q)(z, u) = (−1)qΦ(q)(z, u)

(the same is true for the e conjugation of the harmonic variables and the harmonic

projections of the Grassmann coordinates). Hence, for the superﬁelds with the even U(1)
charge q = 2n it becomes possible to impose the reality condition

^

Φ(2n)(z, u) = Φ(2n)(z, u) .

(4.21)

26

The basic advantage of dealing with the N = 2 superspace extended by the harmonic
variables is that it contains invariant subspaces with the fewer number of Grassmann
coordinates, which are diﬀerent from the standard chiral subspaces and are closed under

the generalized e-conjugation. One of such subspaces, which is usually referred to as the

analytic subspace, is spanned by the coordinates

ζA = (xm

A = xm − 2iθ(iσm ¯θj)u+

Indeed, xm

4.2 Classical action of N = 4 SYM in N = 2 harmonic superspace
The N = 4 vector multiplet consists of the hypermultiplet (N = 2 matter multiplet) and
the N = 2 vector multiplet. In this section we give an overview of these multiplets in the
N = 2 harmonic superspace and then present the N = 4 SYM classical action in terms
of these superﬁelds.

4.2.1

q-hypermultiplet

The Fayet-Sohnius hypermultiplet [58] in harmonic superspace is described by a charged
superﬁeld q+ and its conjugate ˜q+ subject to the analyticity constraints

D+

α q+ = ¯D+

˙α q+ = 0 .

Their free classical action reads [23]

Sfree

q = −Z dζ −4du ˜q+D++q+ .

(4.30)

(4.31)

Here D++ is the harmonic derivative in the analytic basis given by (4.28a) and the inte-
gration measure on the analytic superspace is deﬁned in such a way that the following
properties hold

Z dζ −4(θ+)2(¯θ+)2f (x) =Z d4x f (x) ,
Z du 1 = 1 ,

Z du u+

jn) = 0

(4.32a)

(m + n > 0) .

(4.32b)

Note that the analytic measure dζ −4 is charged, so any Lagrangian given on the analytic
superspace should carry the harmonic U(1) charge +4. The rule of integration over the
harmonic variables (4.32b) implies that the integral of any monomial of harmonics in a
non-singlet irreducible representation of SU(2) vanishes.

The classical action (4.31) yields the equation of motion for the superﬁeld q+

D++q+ = 0 .

(4.33)

It is possible to show that in the central basis with coordinates (zM , u) this equation has
the simple solution

q+(z, u) = u+

i qi(z) ,

(4.34)

that is q+ is linear in harmonics. The analyticity constraints (4.30) acquire the form of
the following constraints on qi(z) [58]

D(i

α qj) = 0 ,

¯D(i

˙α qj) = 0 .

(4.35)

28

It is known that these constraints eliminate all auxiliary ﬁelds in qi and put the physical
scalar and spinor ﬁelds on the mass shell.

In some cases it is convenient to combine the superﬁeld q+ and its conjugate ˜q+ into

a doublet q+
a

(4.36)

(4.37)

In terms of these superﬁelds the classical action (4.31) reads

This action is manifestly invariant under the so-called Pauli-G¨ursey SU(2) symmetry

4.2.2 N = 2 SYM theory in harmonic superspace
Let us consider now the vector gauge multiplet in the N = 2 superspace. The geometric
approach to the gauge theory in the N = 2 superspace is based on extending the N = 2
superspace derivatives DM = (∂m, Di

α, ¯D ˙αi) by the gauge superﬁeld connections

and imposing the following constraints [59]

DM −→ DM = DM + iAM ,

α,Dj

β} = −2iεijεαβ ¯W ,
{Di
{ ¯D ˙αi, ¯Dj ˙β} = −2iεijε ˙α ˙βW ,
{Di

α, ¯D ˙αj} = −2iδi

jDα ˙α .

Here W and ¯W are the superﬁeld strengths which obey the Bianchi identities

¯D ˙αiW = 0 ,
DαiDj

¯W = 0 ,
Di
¯D ˙αj ¯W .
αW = ¯Di

˙α

(4.38)

(4.39a)

(4.39b)

(4.39c)

(4.40a)

(4.40b)

The equations (4.40a) show that the superﬁeld W is chiral and ¯W is antichiral. Therefore,
the N = 2 SYM action is given as an integral over the chiral or antichiral subspaces of
the N = 2 superspace

SN =2

SYM =

1
4

trZ d4xd4θ W 2 =

1
4

trZ d4xd4 ¯θ ¯W 2 .

(4.41)

Here we assume that the integrals over the Grassmann coordinates are normalized so that
the following properties are valid

Z d4θ θ4 = 1 ,

Z d4 ¯θ ¯θ4 = 1 ,

Z d8θ θ4 ¯θ4 = 1 ,

(4.42)

29

where

θ4 = (θ+)2(θ−)2 ,

¯θ4 = (¯θ+)2(¯θ−)2 .

(4.43)

The gauge connections introduced in (4.38) and their superﬁeld strengths appearing

in (4.39a) and (4.39b) are deﬁned up to the gauge transformations

M = −ieiτ (DM e−iτ ) , W ′ = eiτ W e−iτ ,
A′

¯W ′ = eiτ ¯W e−iτ ,

(4.44)

where τ = τ (z) is a real N = 2 superﬁeld gauge parameter. The action (4.41) is obviously
invariant under these transformations. The N = 2 gauge theory introduced through the
gauge connections deﬁned in the standard N = 2 superspace as above is usually referred
to as the τ -frame gauge theory.

The N = 2 SYM Lagrangian (4.41) is expressed in terms of the constrained chiral
(antichiral) superﬁeld strengths W or ¯W . For many application it is necessary to have
an expression for the Lagrangian in terms of unconstrained gauge prepotentials of these
superﬁeld strengths. The harmonic superspace approach naturally provides such a for-
mulation, as is explained below.

The algebra of covariant spinor derivatives (4.39) entails the corollaries

{D+

α ,D+

β } = { ¯D+

˙α , ¯D+

˙β } = {D+

α , ¯D+

˙β } = 0 ,

where

α = u±
D±

i Di
α ,

¯D±
˙α = u±

i

¯Di
˙α .

(4.45)

(4.46)

The relations (4.45) are just the integrability conditions for the existence of the covariantly
analytic superﬁelds:

D+
α Φ(z, u) = 0 ,

¯D+
˙α Φ(z, u) = 0 .

(4.47)

The solution to these constraints can be found with the help of the so-called bridge su-
perﬁeld b = b(z, u). The integrability conditions (4.45) imply the following representation
for the + projections of the gauge-covariant spinor derivatives

α = e−ibD+
D+

α eib ,

¯D+
˙α = e−ib ¯D+

˙α eib .

(4.48)

Without loss of generality the bridge superﬁeld can be chosen real, ˜b(z, u) = b(z, u) . As
follows from (4.48), this superﬁeld is deﬁned modulo gauge transformations,

eib′

= eiλeibe−iτ ,

(4.49)

where τ = τ (z) is an arbitrary real harmonic-independent superﬁeld parameter (it co-
incides with that appearing in (4.44)), while λ = λ(z, u) is an arbitrary real analytic
superﬁeld, ˜λ = λ, D+
˙α λ = 0. Now, the general solution to (4.47) in the analytic
basis is given by

α λ = ¯D+

Φ(z, u) = e−ibΦA(z, u) ,

(4.50)

30

where ΦA(z, u) is the analytic superﬁeld (4.26). Thus, with the help of the bridge su-
perﬁeld we can bring all the diﬀerential operators and the superﬁelds into the so-called
λ-frame, which, being combined with the choice of the analytic coordinate basis, yields
what is called “λ-representation”. In the λ-representation, the covariantly analytic super-
ﬁelds become manifestly analytic and the covariant spinor derivatives D+
˙α acquire
the “short” form without gauge connections. At the same time, the harmonic derivatives
(4.28a) and (4.28b) acquire non-trivial gauge connections

α and ¯D+

D++ = D++ + iV ++ = eibD++e−ib ,
Since the bridge superﬁeld is real with respect to the e conjugation, these new gauge

D−− = D−− + iV −− = eibD−−e−ib .

connections are also real

(4.51)

(4.52)

(4.53)

Moreover, the superﬁeld V ++ is analytic

gV ++ = V ++ , gV −− = V −− .

D+

α V ++ = ¯D+

˙α V ++ = 0

as a consequence of the commutation relations [D+

α ,D++] = [ ¯D++

˙α ,D++] = 0.

It is important to point out that the superﬁelds V ++ and V −− introduced in (4.51)
are not independent. They are related to each other by the “harmonic ﬂatness condition”

D++V −− − D−−V ++ + i[V ++, V −−] = 0 ,

(4.54)

which is a corollary of one of the commutation relations of the algebra (4.29) rewritten in
the λ-frame, [D++,D−−] = D0. It was demonstrated in [60, 61] that the equation (4.54)
can be uniquely solved for V −− in terms of V ++ as the series

V −−(z, u) =

∞Xn=1Z du1 . . . dun

(−i)nV ++(z, u1) . . . V ++(z, un)

2 ) . . . (u+

n u+)

(u+u+

1 )(u+

1 u+

.

(4.55)

This expression involves the harmonic distributions introduced in [40] and described in
detail in [45].

The superﬁelds V ++ and V −− are deﬁned by (4.51) up to the gauge transformations

V ±±′ = −ieiλD±±e−iλ + eiλV ±±e−iλ ,

(4.56)

which follow from (4.49). Since the superﬁeld V ++ is analytic and otherwise uncon-
strained, while V −− is expressed through V ++, just V ++ is the fundamental gauge pre-
potential of N = 2 SYM theory. The superﬁeld strengths W , ¯W and the classical action
(4.41) can be expressed through this prepotential.

31

Since the covariant spinor derivatives in the τ -frame (4.46) are linear in harmonics,

the following simple commutation relations hold in this frame

[D−−,D+

α ] = D−
α ,

[D−−, ¯D+

˙α ] = ¯D−
˙α .

Let us rewrite these commutators in the λ-frame using the rules (4.48) and (4.51),

[(D−−)λ, (D+

α )λ] = (D−

α )λ ,

[(D−−)λ, ( ¯D+

˙α )λ] = ( ¯D−

˙α )λ ,

(4.57)

(4.58)

and take into account the fact that in the λ-frame the covariant spinor derivatives D+
¯D+
˙α are short, (D+
amount to the following expressions for the spinor connections

α and
˙α . Then, the commutation relations (4.58)

α and ( ¯D+

α )λ = D+

(V −

α )λ = −D+

α V −− ,

( ¯V −
˙α )λ = − ¯D+

˙α V −− .

(4.59)

Contracting the anticommutators (4.39a) and (4.39b) with the harmonics u+

i , u−

j , we

ﬁnd the expressions for the superﬁeld strengths,

W = −

i
4{ ¯D+

˙α , ¯D− ˙α} ,

¯W = −

4{D+α,D−

(4.60)

Using the expressions (4.59), we represent these superﬁeld strengths in terms of the non-
analytic harmonic gauge connection V −−

(4.61)

Owing to (4.55), the superﬁeld strengths are functions of the analytic gauge prepotential
V ++. This makes it possible to express the N = 2 SYM classical action (4.41) via V ++
[61]

(4.62)

The derivation of this action from (4.41) requires some algebra, the details of which can
be found, e.g., in [45]. As was demonstrated in [62], the N = 2 SYM classical action in
the form (4.62) is most suitable for quantization and studying quantum aspects of N = 2
gauge theories in superspace.

Using the unconstrained analytic prepotential V ++, it is rather trivial to promote the
free hypermultiplet q+ action (4.31) to the gauge invariant one; this is accomplished just
through the replacement D++ → D++:

Sq = −Z dζ −4du ˜q+D++q+ = −Z dζ −4du ˜q+(D++ + iV ++)q+ .

(4.63)

32

Here we assume that the q-hypermultiplet transforms in some representation of the gauge
group

q+′ = eiλq+ ,

˜q+′ = ˜q+e−iλ ,

(4.64)

and V ++ takes values in the matrix algebra of the generators of this representation. The
classical action is invariant under the gauge transformations (4.64) supplemented by the
corresponding variation (4.56) of the gauge superﬁeld V ++.

If the q-hypermultiplet transforms in the adjoint representation of the gauge group,
the action (4.63) possesses the Pauli-G¨ursey SU(2) symmetry. Using the notations (4.36),
it can be rewritten as

Sq =

1
2

trZ dζ −4du q+

a D++q+a ,

(4.65)

where the covariant harmonic derivative acts on the hypermultiplet according to the rule

D++q+a = D++q+a + i[V ++, q+a] .

(4.66)

4.2.3 N = 4 SYM classical action
In the N = 2 harmonic superspace, the N = 4 vector gauge multiplet is represented by
the N = 2 gauge multiplet V ++ and the hypermultiplet q+. Both these multiplets should
belong to the same adjoint representation of the gauge group. The N = 4 SYM action is
given by the sum of the actions (4.62) and (4.65) for these multiplets,

N = 2 supersymmetry is closed oﬀ shell.

In conclusion of this section we present the harmonic superspace formulation of the

abelian N = 4 SYM theory. In this case the action (4.67) acquires the simple form

and also obey the Bianchi identity

(D±)2W = ( ¯D±)2 ¯W .

The relations (4.71a) and (4.71b) follow from (4.40a) and (4.40b), respectively. The
equations of motion for these superﬁelds implied by the action (4.69) read

a = 0 ,

(D±)2W = 0 ,

( ¯D±)2 ¯W = 0 .

They are obtained by varying (4.69) with respect to the analytic unconstrained prepo-

In what follows, the equations (4.72) will be referred to as the on-shell
constraints.

Note that the hypermultiplet equation of motion (4.72a) in the central basis implies

that q+

This form of hidden supersymmetry is useful for checking the invariance of the action
functionals up to terms vanishing on the equations of motion. We will employ these
transformations in the next subsection for constructing the N = 4 SYM low-energy
eﬀective action in the N = 2 harmonic superspace.

4.3 Derivation of the eﬀective action

Our goal is to ﬁnd the four-derivative part of the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action
Γ. In the component formulation, this action should include both the term F 4/X 4 (2.11)
and the Wess-Zumino term (2.13), as well as all their N = 4 supersymmetric completions.
Recall that the F 4/X 4 term in the N = 2 superspace is described by the non-

holomorphic potential (2.12) [12, 13]:

Z d12z H(W, ¯W ) ,

H(W, ¯W ) = c ln

W
Λ

ln

¯W
Λ

,

(4.76)

where Λ is an arbitrary scale. The value of the constant c was calculated in [14, 15,
16, 18] (see also the review [63]). In particular, for the case of the gauge group SU(2)
spontaneously broken down to U(1) the value of this coeﬃcient is

c =

1

(4π)2 .

(4.77)

The N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action should be an N = 4 supersymmetric

completion of the N = 2 non-holomorphic potential (4.76):

Γ = Z d12zdu Leﬀ(W, ¯W , q±
a ) ,
a ) = H(W, ¯W ) + L(W, ¯W , q±
a ) .

Leﬀ(W, ¯W , q±

(4.78a)

(4.78b)

The part of the eﬀective Lagrangian L(W, ¯W , q±
a ) should be ﬁxed from the requirement
that the eﬀective action Γ is invariant under N = 4 supersymmetry. Since we are in-
terested in the on-shell low-energy eﬀective action, it will be suﬃcient to impose the
condition that Γ is invariant under the hidden N = 2 supersymmetry transformations in
the on-shell form (4.75).

To begin with, we compute the variation of the N = 2 non-holomorphic eﬀective

action under the N = 2 supersymmetry transformations (4.75)

δZ d12zdu H(W, ¯W ) =

(4.81)

(4.82)

the variation of the non-holomorphic potential (4.79) is canceled by the variation of L1,
but the contributions from the second term in (4.81) remain non-canceled.

The variation of (4.82) can be brought to the form

(4.83)

where we have integrated by parts and used the equations (4.70)–(4.74), as well as cyclic
identities for the SU(2) doublet indices. Now let us consider the quantity

Leﬀ,2 = Leﬀ,1 +

c

3(cid:18)q+aq−
¯W W (cid:19)3

a

≡ Leﬀ,1 + L2 ,

(4.84)

where Leﬀ,1 is given by (4.82). The coeﬃcient in the new term L2 has been ﬁxed so that
the variation of the numerator of this term cancels (4.83). The rest of the full variation
of L2 once again survives, and in order to cancel it, one is led to add the term

L3 = −

2c

9 (cid:18) q+aq−
¯W W (cid:19)3

a

(4.85)

to L1 + L2, and so on.

The above consideration suggests that the hypermultiplet-dependent part of the eﬀec-

tive Lagrangian (4.78b) has the form of the power series

L =

∞Xn=1

Ln = c

cn(cid:18)q+aq−
¯W W (cid:19)n

,

∞Xn=1

(4.86)

where cn are some coeﬃcients. We have already found that c1 = −1, c2 = 1
Now we are prepared to determine the form of the generic coeﬃcient cn.

3, c3 = − 2
9.

Consider two adjacent terms in the series (4.86)

cn−1(cid:18)q+aq−

¯W W (cid:19)n−1

a

¯W W (cid:19)n
+ cn(cid:18)q+aq−

a

(4.87)

36

and assume that the variation of the numerator of the ﬁrst term has already been used
to cancel the remaining part of the variation of preceding term under the full superspace
integral. Then we rewrite the rest of the full variation of the ﬁrst term using the same
manipulations as in (4.83) and require that this part should be canceled by the variation
of the numerator of the second term in (4.87). This gives rise to the following recursive
relation between the coeﬃcients cn−1 and cn:

cn = −2

(n − 1)2
n(n + 1)

cn−1 .

Taking into account that c1 = −1, we ﬁnd the value of the generic coeﬃcient

cn =

(−2)n
n2(n + 1)

.

(4.88)

(4.89)

As a result, we ﬁnd the full hypermultiplet completion of the non-holomorphic poten-

tial in the form

It is worth to note that the expression (4.91) is harmonic-independent for the on-
a. Indeed, (4.91) can be

shell hypermultiplets which are linear in harmonics, q±
identically rewritten as

a = u±

i qi

Z = −

¯W W

.

(4.92)

As a consequence, the eﬀective Lagrangian (4.90) is harmonic-independent and one can
omit the integration over the harmonics in (4.78a). Taking this into account, we rewrite
the ﬁnal answer for the four-derivative part of the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action
in the N = 2 superspace as

(4.93)

The N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action in this form was ﬁrst obtained in the paper
[21], using the procedure described in this section. In the subsequent papers [27, 28, 29],

37

the expression (4.93) was reproduced by direct calculations within the quantum pertur-
bative theory in N = 2 harmonic superspace.

It should be noted that the low-energy eﬀective action (4.93) is scale invariant. It is
possible to show that it respects also the SU(2, 2|2) superconformal symmetry realized
on the superﬁelds W , ¯W and q±
a . The on-shell closure of this symmetry with the hidden
N = 2 supersymmetry is just the superconformal P SU(2, 2|4) symmetry. To avoid a
possible confusion, we would like also to point out that the expression (4.93) with Z
(4.91) as the argument in L (and with an integral over harmonics restored) is an oﬀ-shell
invariant of the manifest N = 2 supersymmetry. The on-shell conditions need to be
imposed only when we prove the hidden second on-shell N = 2 supersymmetry of this
N = 2 superﬁeld expression.

α and a gauge vector Am with the Maxwell ﬁeld strength Fmn =
∂mAn − ∂nAm. The on-shell hypermultiplet contains SU(2) doublet of complex scalars
f i and two spinors ψα, ¯χ ˙α. We adopt the following two essential simpliﬁcations, while
considering the component structure of the eﬀective action: (i) we discard all spinor and
auxiliary ﬁelds and (ii) we assume that the bosonic ﬁelds obey free classical equations of
motion. Though these constraints are very strong, they suﬃce to determine the bosonic
core of the low-energy eﬀective action which is non-vanishing on the mass shell. Taking
these constraints into account, we ﬁnd the component structure of the superﬁelds W , ¯W
and q+, ˜q+ in the form

W = i√2φ − 2√2θ−σm ¯θ+∂mφ − θ+

The component ﬁelds in these expressions were normalized in agreement with the nota-
tions of [45].

4.4.1 F 4/X 4 term

To derive the F 4/X 4 term in the N = 4 SYM eﬀective action, it is suﬃcient to consider
a constant Maxwell ﬁeld strength Fmn and discard all derivatives of the scalars. Then,

38

we substitute (4.94) and (4.95) into (4.93) and integrate over all Grassmann coordinates
according to the rules (4.42)

ε0123 = 1 .

(4.97)

Now it remains to express the complex scalars f i and φ via the six real scalars XA,
A = 1, . . . , 6,

f 1 = X1 + iX2 ,

f 2 = X3 + iX4 , φ = X6 + iX5 .

(4.98)

Then, with c given in (4.77), the considered part of the low-energy eﬀective action takes
exactly the form of the F 4/X 4 term (2.11)

4.4.2 Wess-Zumino term

In order to single out the Wess-Zumino term in the component structure of the low-energy
eﬀective action (4.93), it is suﬃcient to consider another approximation: We discard the
Maxwell ﬁeld Fmn, but keep the space-time derivatives of the scalars.
First of all, we point out that the non-holomorphic potential ln W

Λ cannot make a
contribution to the Wess-Zumino term because it involves only two out of six scalar ﬁelds.
Thus we have to consider only that part of the eﬀective action (4.93) which is described
by the function L ,

Λ ln ¯W

(4.100)

ΓWZ =Z d4xd8θ L(W, ¯W , q±

a ) .

Here we assume that the superﬁelds contain only scalar ﬁelds in their component ﬁeld
expansion.

For deriving the Wess-Zumino term we will use the rule of integration over the Grass-

mann variables which is equivalent to (4.42)

Z d8θ L = ¯D4D4L|θ=0 ,

Thus we have to hit the function L by eight covariant spinor derivatives. While doing so,
we should take into account that for the superﬁelds W , ¯W and q±

constraints (4.70)–(4.74) a lot of identities can be derived, e.g.,

With c deﬁned in (4.77), it perfectly matches the expression (3.21).

The Wess-Zumino term (4.113) in the component ﬁeld formulation of the N = 4 SYM
low-energy eﬀective action (4.93) was found for the ﬁrst time in [24], although attempts
to derive this term were undertaken in the preceding papers [64, 65].

As we have shown in sect. 3.3, the Wess-Zumino term in the form (4.113) has a
manifest symmetry under the group SO(4) × SO(2) which, in the considered setting, is
locally isomorphic to SU(2)R × SU(2)P G × U(1). Here, the group SU(2)R corresponds
to the R-symmetry of the N = 2 superspace, while SU(2)P G is the Pauli-G¨ursey group
which acts on the index a of the hypermultiplet q+
a in (4.69). The last U(1) factor is
the phase rotation of the N = 2 superﬁeld strengths W and ¯W in (4.69). Thus it is
absolutely natural that the Wess-Zumino term in the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective
action appears in the N = 2 harmonic superspace approach just in the form (4.113) with
manifest SO(4) × SO(2) symmetry.

5 Low-energy eﬀective action in N = 3 harmonic

superspace

Classical action of N = 3 SYM theory in harmonic superspace was constructed in the
pioneering papers [46, 47]. On the mass shell, this theory is known to be equivalent

41

to N = 4 SYM [45]. Since no N = 4 oﬀ-shell superﬁeld description for N = 4 SYM
theory is known so far, the N = 3 harmonic superspace provides the maximal number
of manifest supersymmetries. As a consequence, it appears very eﬃcient at quantum
level. For instance, the quantum ﬁniteness of N = 3 SYM theory can be easily proved
just by analyzing the dimension of the propagator for gauge superﬁeld in the N = 3
harmonic superspace [66]. What is more important for the present consideration, N = 3
supersymmetry, combined with the requirement of scale invariance, prove to be so strong
that these symmetries ﬁx uniquely, up to an overall coeﬃcient, the leading part of the
N = 3 SYM low-energy eﬀective action [26]. In the present section, we explicitly construct
this eﬀective action, reviewing the results of [26].

To make our consideration more pedagogical, we start by explaining basics of the
N = 3 harmonic superspace and gauge theory in it. The detailed exposition of N = 3
SYM theory is given in the book [45].

5.1 N = 3 harmonic superspace setup
The standard N = 3 superspace is parametrized by the coordinates (4.1), where the
indices i, j = 1, 2, 3 correspond now to the SU(3) R-symmetry group. The covariant
α and ¯Di ˙α in this superspace have the same form as in (4.4) and
spinor derivatives Di
obey the anti-commutation relations (4.5). We extend this superspace by the harmonic
variables uI
i = (u1

deﬁning properties

(5.5a)

(5.5b)

(5.5c)

(5.5d)

By analogy with the N = 2 harmonic superspace, in the N = 3 harmonic superspace
we will consider only those superﬁelds which possess deﬁnite U(1) charges (q1, q2) with
respect to the operators S1 and S2:

S1Φ(q1,q2)(z, u) = q1Φ(q1,q2)(z, u) ,

S2Φ(q1,q2)(z, u) = q2Φ(q1,q2)(z, u) .

(5.6)

These equations eﬀectively restrict the harmonic dependence of the ﬁelds originally deﬁned
on the full SU(3) group manifold to the coset SU(3)/[U(1) × U(1)]. We will assume that
the superﬁelds are smooth function on this coset, such that they can always be represented
by power series expansions over the harmonic variables.

The deﬁning constraints (5.1) can be viewed as the orthogonality and completeness
relations for the harmonic variables. They allow one to form the harmonic projections
of any objects with SU(3) indices just by contracting the latter with the complemen-
tary SU(3) indices of the harmonics. For instance, for the Grassmann coordinates and
covariant spinor derivatives we have

Like in the N = 2 harmonic superspace, the conventional complex conjugation is
not useful as it does not preserve the analyticity. Therefore, it is customary to use the

44

generalized complex conjugation denoted by e and deﬁned by the following properties:

On the harmonic-independent objects it coincides with the usual complex conjugation,
see eq. (4.17), while on the harmonic variables it acts according to the rules 11

where f is an arbitrary function depending on the superspace coordinates (xm, θα

It is easy to see that the analytic subspace with the coordinates (5.10) is closed under

the e -conjugation, but not under the conventional complex conjugation.
5.2 Gauge theory in N = 3 harmonic superspace
In this section we shortly review the superspace description of N = 3 SYM theory.

The constraints of this theory in the conventional N = 3 superspace were introduced in
[59], while their harmonic superspace version was discussed in the book [45] (see also [68]).
Here we limit our attention only to the abelian case, which is suﬃcient for constructing
the low-energy eﬀective action in the Coulomb branch.

In the standard geometric approach, the gauge theory is introduced through adding
gauge connections to the superspace derivatives, as in eq. (4.38). In the N = 3 case, the
analogs of the constraints (4.39) read

(5.19b)

(5.19c)
where Wij = −Wji and its conjugate ¯W ij = Wij are the superﬁeld strengths for the N = 3
gauge vector multiplet. The constraints (5.19) imply the following Bianchi identities for
these superﬁeld strengths [59]

from the convention used in [45].

11Here we use the convention for the e -conjugation adopted in [67, 26] which is somewhat diﬀerent

45

It is known that these constraints kill all unphysical (auxiliary) components in the su-
perﬁeld strengths, simultaneously yielding the free equations of motion for the physical
components of the N = 3 vector multiplet.

Let us introduce the harmonic projections of the superﬁeld strengths

For these superﬁelds one can deduce many oﬀ- and on-shell constraints which follow from
(5.20). Here we will need only the independent constraints for the superﬁeld strengths
¯W 12 and W23. They can be grouped into the three sets:

¯ϕI = ¯ui

(5.26)

and ϕi is a triplet of physical scalar ﬁelds subject to the Klein-Gordon equation (cid:3)ϕi =
0 . The four spinor ﬁelds are accommodated by the SU(3) singlet λα and the triplet
λIα = ¯ui
Iλiα , all satisfying the free equations of motion, ∂α ˙αλα = ∂α ˙αλiα = 0. The ﬁelds
Fαβ = F(αβ) and ¯F ˙α ˙β = ¯F( ˙α ˙β) are spinorial components of the Maxwell ﬁeld strength
Fmn = ∂mAn − ∂nAm, ∂mFmn = 0.

Similarly to (5.8), the gauge-covariant spinor derivatives have harmonic projections

(5.27)

These relations are just the integrability conditions for the existence of the covariantly
analytic superﬁelds deﬁned by

D1
αΦ = 0 ,

¯D3 ˙αΦ = 0 .

(5.28)

The explicit solution to these constraints can be found using the bridge superﬁeld b =
b(z, u) which solves the integrability conditions (5.27):

α = e−ibD1
D1

αeib ,

¯D3 ˙α = e−ib ¯D3 ˙αeib .

(5.29)

Without loss of generality, the bridge superﬁeld can be chosen real, ˜b(z, u) = b(z, u). Like
in N = 2 SYM theory, b(z, u) in (5.29) is deﬁned modulo the gauge transformations

eib′

= eiλeibe−iτ ,

(5.30)

where τ = τ (z) is an arbitrary real harmonic-independent superﬁeld, while λ = λ(z, u) is
an arbitrary tilde-real and analytic superﬁeld, ˜λ = λ, D1
αλ = ¯D3 ˙αλ = 0 . Using (5.29),
the general solution to (5.28) can be written as

Φ(z, u) = e−ibΦA(z, u) ,

(5.31)

where ΦA(z, u) is the manifestly analytic N = 3 superﬁeld (5.12).

Thus, the introduction of the bridge superﬁeld allows one to bring all the diﬀerential
operators and superﬁelds to the λ-representation, in which the covariantly analytic super-
α and ¯D3 ˙α cease
ﬁelds become manifestly analytic and the covariant spinor derivatives D1
to contain the gauge connections.

On the contrary, the harmonic derivatives (5.13) and (5.15) acquire gauge connections

The diﬀerence from the N = 2 case is nevertheless as follows. The harmonic commu-
tators (5.5) can also be rewritten in the λ-frame. One of these relations is the equation

(5.37)

which implies that the analytic gauge connection V 1

(5.38)

Therefore, in what follows we will consider only the analytic connections V 1
the independent basic ones. Next, the commutators (5.5d) in the λ-frame are

[D1

2,D2

[D2

3,D3

2] = S2 ,

(5.39)

where the operators S1 and S2 do not have gauge connections, since the bridge superﬁeld
b is uncharged. As a consequence of (5.39), the non-analytic gauge connections V 2

In contrast to the N = 2 case, eq. (4.55), the explicit solutions of these equations are not
known because harmonic distributions with the SU(3) harmonics are not well worked out

48

so far. Nevertheless, given that the solution of these equations exists and is unique, we
can treat the superﬁelds V 2

check that the superﬁeld strengths (5.45) are invariant under the gauge transformations

The N = 3 superconformal group SU(2, 2|3), besides the N = 3 super Poincar´e transfor-

In this paper we will use the so-called passive form of superconformal transformations
of superﬁelds, when the variation is taken at diﬀerent points, e.g., δscW ≃ W ′(x′)− W (x).
In this case we have to take care of transformations of the superspace derivatives and the
superspace integration measure. Nevertheless, this does not lead to extra complications
since we will study the part of eﬀective action which is described by the superﬁeld strengths
without derivatives on them. Moreover, it is possible to show, see, e.g., [45], that the
integration measure of the analytic superspace (5.10) deﬁned as follows [67, 26],

Finally, using the variations of the harmonic gauge connections (5.53) and derivatives

5.4 Classical N = 3 SYM action
Superﬁeld classical oﬀ-shell action of N = 3 SYM theory was constructed in [46, 47]. For
completeness, here we review this construction, although it will not be used in the next
sections, when studying the eﬀective action. As we will show, the classical action has
a very remarkable Chern-Simons form which does not resemble the superﬁeld classical
SYM actions neither in N = 1 nor in N = 2 superspaces. In this section we consider the
general case of non-abelian gauge theory.
i and ¯DI ˙α =
Recall that in the τ -frame the covariant spinor derivatives DI
¯Di ˙α¯ui
I possess gauge connections which are subject to the constraints (5.19). The harmonic
derivatives (5.13) and (5.15) are automatically gauge-covariant in the τ -frame and so do
not require gauge connections. It is unclear how to relax the constraints (5.19) in such a
way that they would appear as Euler-Lagrange equations associated with some superﬁeld
action. This becomes possible after passing to the λ-frame.

α = Di

αuI

In the λ-frame the covariant spinor derivatives D1

α and ¯D3 ˙α become short (they have
no gauge connections), but the covariant harmonic derivatives acquire gauge connections
(5.32). Let us concentrate on the analyticity-preserving derivatives D1
3 (see
(5.36)). As follows from (5.5), the mutual commutators of these derivatives read

Relaxing the constraints (5.59) as in eqs. (5.60) amounts to going oﬀ shell. Coming

back to the mass shell requires these harmonic superﬁeld strengths to vanish,

The action (5.63) also respects full SU(2, 2|3) superconformal symmetry. To check this,
one has to take into account that the analytic measure is superconformally invariant, see
(5.51), while the harmonic derivatives and prepotentials transform according to the rules
(5.52) and (5.53), respectively.

The action (5.63) has the very speciﬁc form as compared to the N = 2 SYM action
(4.62). The latter is non-polynomial in the gauge prepotential (in the non-abelian case)
while the above N = 3 SYM action has only cubic interaction vertex. Surprisingly, the
superﬁeld Lagrangian of N = 3 SYM theory is of the ﬁrst order in harmonic derivatives.
The form of this Lagrangian resembles the Chern-Simons Lagrangians, though the action
(5.63) describes the full-ﬂedged N = 3 super Yang-Mills theory. In fact, as was pointed
out in [70], the N = 3 superﬁeld Lagrangian does acquire the literal Chern-Simons form
for the properly deﬁned one-form of gauge connection.

In components, the oﬀ-shell N = 3 gauge multiplet contains an inﬁnite tower of
auxiliary ﬁelds [46, 47] (along with an inﬁnite number of gauge degrees of freedom most
It is possible to show that, once
of which, however, are brought away in WZ gauge).

12The overall coeﬃcient in this action is chosen in agreement with the conventions of [67].

53

all auxiliary ﬁelds have been eliminated from the action, one is left with the multiplet of
physical ﬁelds which coincides with the N = 4 gauge multiplet on the mass shell. The
classical action for the physical ﬁelds has exactly the form (2.3). Thus, classically, the
N = 3 and N = 4 gauge theories are equivalent on the mass shell.

5.5 Superconformal eﬀective action

The aim of this section is to construct the N = 3 superspace prototype of the eﬀective
action (4.93). Before solving this problem, let us brieﬂy discuss a closely related issue con-
cerning the N = 3 supersymmetric generalization of the Born-Infeld theory constructed
for the ﬁrst time in [67].

The Lagrangian of the Born-Infeld theory is a non-polynomial function of the abelian
ﬁeld strength Fmn. Being expanded in a power series in Fmn, it starts with the standard
Maxwell F 2 term, while the next term is F 4 ≡ F 2 ¯F 2, where F 2 = F αβFαβ, ¯F 2 = ¯F ˙α ˙β ¯F ˙α ˙β
and Fαβ, ¯F ˙α ˙β are the spinorial components of Fmn. The N = 3 supersymmetric general-
ization of this F 4 term is given by [67]

S4 =

1

32Z dζ(33

11)du

( ¯W 12W23)2

(¯ΛΛ)2

,

(5.68)

where Λ is a coupling constant of dimension one in mass units, which is introduced to
ensure the correct dimension of the integrand. The analytic measure deﬁned as in (5.50)
11)du] = 0 , and [ ¯W 12] = [W23] = 1 . With this analytic measure, it
is dimensionless, [dζ(33
is straightforward to check that, together with other component terms, the action (5.68)
yields the standard F 4 term,

S4 =

1

2Z d4x

F 2 ¯F 2
(¯ΛΛ)2

+ . . . .

Consider now the superconformal variation of the action (5.68)

δscS4 =

1

16Z dζ(33

11)du(A + ¯A)

( ¯W 12W23)2

(¯ΛΛ)2

,

(5.69)

(5.70)

where we made use of the variations of the superﬁeld strengths (5.56) and the property
of invariance of the analytic measure (5.51). Here A and ¯A are the superﬁeld parame-
ters of superconformal transformations (5.57) collecting the constant parameters of the
superconformal transformations (5.47) and (5.48). We see that the action (5.68) is not
superconformal, since its variation (5.70) is non-vanishing. In the present section we will
construct a superconformal generalization of (5.68) and will show that it contains the
terms (2.11) and (2.13) in its component-ﬁeld expansion.

54

5.5.1 Scale and γ5 invariant F 4/X 4 term

We will denote the superconformal generalization of (5.68) by Γ to stress that it is a part
of the N = 3 SYM low-energy eﬀective action. The action Γ should meet the following
criteria:

1. It should be a local functional deﬁned on the analytic superspace and constructed

out of the superﬁeld strengths ¯W 12 and W23 without derivatives on them,

Γ =Z dζ(33

33( ¯W 12, W23) .

11)du H11
The analytic Lagrangian density H11
33 is an arbitrary function of its arguments, such
that its external harmonic U(1) charges cancel those of the analytic integration
measure. This is the most general form of the superspace action yielding terms with
four-derivatives in components, since the analytic measure (5.50) contains just eight
spinor derivatives which can produce four space-time ones on the component ﬁelds.

(5.71)

2. The action Γ should be invariant under the superconformal transformations (5.56),

δscΓ = 0 .

(5.72)

As a weaker requirement, in this subsection we will employ only the scale- and γ5-
transformations out of the full SU(2, 2|3) superconformal group. We will show that
this is suﬃcient to uniquely specify the structure of the action. The check of the
full superconformal symmetry will be performed in the next subsection.

3. In the component-ﬁeld expansion the action Γ should reproduce the scale- and

SU(3)-invariant F 4/X 4 term (5.69),

Z d4x

F 2 ¯F 2
(ϕi ¯ϕi)2 .

(5.73)

4. We are interested in the low-energy eﬀective action for massless ﬁelds, with massive
ones being integrated out. The massive ﬁelds appear in the Coulomb branch, when
the gauge symmetry is broken down spontaneously. For instance, the SU(2) gauge
symmetry is broken down to U(1) , when the scalar ﬁeld corresponding to the Cartan
subalgebra of su(2) acquire non-trivial vevs,

ci = hϕii 6= 0 ,

¯ci = h ¯ϕii 6= 0 .

(5.74)

However, the eﬀective action should be independent of any particular choice of these
constants,

because such a dependence would break superconformal invariance of the action.

Γ(c′i, ¯c′

j) = Γ(ci, ¯cj) ,

ci¯ci 6= 0 ,

(5.75)

55

5. Finally, we simplify the problem by considering only those parts of the action (5.71),
which do not vanish on the mass shell, i.e., we will assume that the superﬁeld
strengths obey the constraints (5.22)–(5.23). We will neglect all terms in the action
Γ which vanish when these constraints are imposed. As a consequence, one is free
to add to Γ , or to subtract from it, the following expressions which vanish on the
mass shell,

Z dζ(33
Z dζ(33

11) ¯W 12F (W23) ∝ Z d4x(D3)2(D2)2( ¯D1)2[F (W23)( ¯D2)2 ¯W 12] ≃ 0 ,
11) W23F ( ¯W 12) ∝ Z d4x(D3)2( ¯D2)2( ¯D1)2[F ( ¯W 12)(D2)2W23] ≃ 0 .

(5.76)

Here F (W ) is an arbitrary function of its argument. We will frequently employ this
property, when deriving the action.

Now we turn to constructing the action Γ that meets the requirements and properties

listed above.

As the ﬁrst step, we introduce the shifted scalar ﬁelds, φi and ¯φi,

ϕi = ci + φi ,

¯ϕi = ¯ci + ¯φi ,

hφii = h ¯φii = 0 .

(5.77)

Next, we deﬁne the harmonic projections of these vev constants

c1 = u1

i ci ,

c2 = u2

i ci

c3 = u3

i ci ,

¯c1 = ¯ui

1¯ci ,

¯c2 = ¯ui

2¯ci ,

¯c3 = ¯ui

3¯ci .

(5.78)

Using these objects, we introduce the shifted superﬁeld strengths, ¯ω12 and ω23,

¯W 12 = ¯c3 + ¯ω12 ,

W23 = c1 + ω23 .

(5.79)

Under the scale and γ5 transformations these shifted superﬁelds transform inhomoge-
neously,

δsc ¯ω12 = ¯A¯c3 + ¯A¯ω12 ,

(5.80)
where A = −a + 2ib. The case of generic A and ¯A deﬁned in (5.57) will be considered in
the next subsection.

δscω23 = Ac1 + Aω23 ,

We point out that on shell, when the relations (5.76) are valid, the non-superconformal

action (5.68) can be rewritten in terms of ¯ω12 and ω23 as

S4 =

1

32Z dζ(33

11)du

(¯ω12ω23)2

(ci¯ci)2

.

(5.81)

Here we substituted (ci¯ci)2 in the denominator instead of (¯ΛΛ)2, because no other dimen-
sionful constants besides the vevs ci can be present in the superconformal case.

56

We seek for a superconformal generalization of the action (5.81) in the form

Γ =

(5.82)

where H(x, y) is some function to be determined and α is a dimensionless coupling constat.
The arguments ¯ω12c3
of the function H are uncharged and dimensionless. We
ci¯ci
assume that the function H has a regular power expansion with respect to its arguments,

and ω23¯c1
ci¯ci

H(x, y) =

αm,nxmyn ,

∞Xm,n=0

(5.83)

with undeﬁned coeﬃcients αm,n. The reality of the action (5.82) with respect to the tilde-
conjugation implies the symmetry of this function, H(x, y) = H(y, x) , whence αm,n =
αn,m .

Reordering the summation in (5.83), it is convenient to represent (5.82) as

Γ =

Γn =

ci¯ci (cid:19)n−p

. (5.84)

The invariance of the action (5.84) under the transformations (5.80) can be secured order
by order, i.e., the non-vanishing terms from δscΓn are required to be canceled by similar
terms from δscΓn+1, and so forth. To simplify the derivation, we put ci¯ci = 1 and α = 32;
these constants will be restored in the ﬁnal expression.

Consider two lowest terms in the series (5.84),

The superconformal variation of Γ0 reads

11)du(¯ω12ω23)2(¯ω12c3 + ω23¯c1) .

11)du(¯ω12ω23)2 ,

Γ0 = α0,0Z dζ(33
Γ1 = α0,1Z dζ(33
δscΓ0 = 2α0,0(A + ¯A)Z dζ(33

11)du(¯ω12ω23)2 .

(5.85)

(5.86)

Note that the terms with ¯ω12 ¯ω12ω23 and ¯ω12ω23ω23 vanish on shell because of the relations
(5.76).

The superconformal variation of Γ1 reads

δscΓ1 = 3α0,1Z dζ(33

11)du(cid:2)(¯ω12ω23)2( ¯Ac3¯c3 + Ac1¯c1) + O(ω5)(cid:3) .

Using the identities

c1 = D1

2c2 = D1

3c3 ,

3¯c1 = −D2

3¯c2 ,

¯c3 = −D1
57

(5.87)

(5.89)

We substitute these expressions into (5.87) and integrate by parts with respect to the
harmonic derivatives D1

3 and D1

δscΓ1 = α0,1Z dζ(33

11)du(cid:2)( ¯A + A)(¯ω12ω23)2 + O(ω5)(cid:3) .

(5.90)

Here we made also use of the identity c1¯c1 + c2¯c2 + c3¯c3 = ci¯ci = 1. Comparing (5.90) with
(5.86), we observe that the terms with four superﬁeld strengths are canceled out under
the condition

Let us now consider the n-th term in the series (5.84),

α0,1 = −2α0,0 .

(5.91)

Γn =Z dζ(33

expression c1(¯c1)n−p(c3)p in (5.93) produces the term

n − p
n + 2

(c3)p(¯c1)n−p−1 .

(5.97)

Taking all this into account, the variation (5.93) can be written as

δscΓn = Z dζ(33

We observe that the terms in the last two lines in (5.98) cancel similar terms in the ﬁrst
line of δscΓn−1, provided that the coeﬃcients αij obey the following two equations

(5.99)

As a consequence, any two adjacent coeﬃcients are related as

αp,j
αp,j−1

= −

(j + 1)(p + j + 2)

(j + 2)j

.

The solution of this equation reads

αm,n = (−1)m+n

(m + n + 2)!

(n + 2)n!(m + 2)m!

.

(5.100)

(5.101)

With these coeﬃcients, the series (5.83) can be summed up to the function

H(x, y) =

ln(1 + x + y)

x2y2

+

1

xy(1 + x + y) −

ln(1 + x)

x2y2 −

ln(1 + y)

.

(5.102)

We point out that this function is regular at the origin,

lim
x,y→0

H(x, y) =

1
2

.

(5.103)

Hence the action (5.82) with this function is well-deﬁned and the harmonic integral does
not encounter any singularities.

59

The contributions from the last two terms in (5.102) to the action (5.82) vanish on shell
due to the properties (5.76).13 Therefore, the on-shell eﬀective action can be rewritten in
the following explicit form

Γ =

(5.104)
Although the charged objects c3 and ¯c1 appear in the denominators, they do not lead
to the divergent harmonic integrals. It can be explicitly checked that upon passing to
the component form of the action (5.104), all dangerous terms with divergent harmonic
integrals vanish after performing the integration over the Grassmann variables.

5.5.2 Complete N = 3 superconformal symmetry
In the previous section we found the low-energy eﬀective action (5.104) by imposing the
requirements of scale and γ5-invariance only. In this section we demonstrate that this ac-
tion is invariant under the full SU(2, 2|3) superconformal group. For this purpose we have
to consider the transformations (5.56) which include all parameters of the superconformal
transformations. The corresponding variations (5.80) of the shifted superﬁeld strengths
¯ω12 and ω23 read

δsc ¯ω12 = A¯ω12 + A¯c3 + λ2
δscω23 = ¯Aω23 + ¯Ac1 − λ1

3¯c2 + λ1
2c2 − λ1

3¯c1 ,
3c3 ,

(5.105)

where A and ¯A are given in (5.57) and λI
action (5.82) under these transformations is as follows

J are deﬁned in (5.49). The variation of the

(5.106)

For simplicity, we set here ci¯ci = 1 , so x = ¯ω12c3, y = ω23¯c1. The ﬁrst and second lines in
(5.106) are tilde-conjugated to each other.

Given the explicit form (5.102) of the function H(x, y), it is easy to check that it solves

the diﬀerential equations

y(x, y) =

x(1 + x)(1 + x + y)2 ,

1

y(1 + y)(1 + x + y)2 .

(5.107)

13The properties (5.76) are valid essentially on shell. Therefore the last two terms in (5.102) can be
neglected only on the mass shell although they can be important for the oﬀ-shell completion of the action.

60

Taking them into account, we are going to show that the integrand in (5.106) is a total
harmonic derivative, so the variation (5.106) vanishes.

To this end, we introduce the auxiliary functions f (x, y) and ˜f (x, y):

f (x, y) =

y(y + 1)(x + y + 1)

˜f (x, y) = f (y, x) =

Now, taking into account the relations (5.110), (5.114) and (5.118), we observe that
the variation (5.106) can be represented as a linear combination of harmonic derivatives
acting on the quantities composed of the functions (5.108), (5.112) and (5.115),

The variation (5.119) vanishes as an integral of total harmonic derivative. This proves
the invariance of the action (5.104) under the full SU(2, 2|3) superconformal group.14
14Note that (5.104) is SU (2, 2|3) invariant for any ci 6= 0, without any restriction on the norm ci¯ci

which was set equal to 1 in the above consideration merely for convenience.

5.5.3

Independence of the choice of vacua

By construction, the eﬀective action (5.82) with the function H given in (5.102) is well
deﬁned only on the Coulomb branch of N = 3 SYM theory. This is manifested in the
explicit presence of non-zero vacuum constants ci and ¯ci in the Lagrangian in (5.82). How-
ever, the action itself should be independent of any particular choice of these constants,
except for the point ci = 0 at which the eﬀective action is singular.

Let us rewrite (5.82) in terms of the original (non-shifted) superﬁeld strengths ¯W 12

and W23

(5.120)
In the previous subsection we proved that this action is invariant under the full SU(2, 2|3)
superconformal group. Taking into account that the analytic integration measure is
SU(2, 2|3) invariant by itself, the property of superconformal invariance of the action
can be written in the ﬁnite form as

Γ[ ¯W 12, W23; ci, ¯ci] = Γ′[ ¯W 12′, W23

′; ci, ¯ci] = Γ[ ¯W 12′, W23

′; ci, ¯ci] .

(5.121)

In particular, consider scale and γ5 transformations of the superﬁeld strength in the ﬁnite
form,

¯W 12 → e ¯A ¯W 12 ,

W23 → eAW23 ,

(5.122)

where A = −a + 2ib. The transformation of the action (5.120) under (5.122) can be
represented as

Γ[ ¯W 12, W23; ci, ¯ci] = Γ[e ¯A ¯W 12, eAW23; ci, ¯ci]

¯W 12 − e− ¯A¯c3

W23 − e−Ac1

, e− ¯A¯c1

(5.123)

Here the A-dependence is absorbed into the vev constants, ci → e−Aci, ¯ci → e− ¯A¯ci.
Hence, the superconformal invariance of the action (5.120) implies its independence of
the complex rescalings of the vev constants,

Γ[ ¯W 12, W23; ci, ¯ci] = Γ[e ¯A ¯W 12, eAW23; ci, ¯ci] = Γ[ ¯W 12, W23; e− ¯Aci, e−A¯ci] .

(5.124)

In a similar way, one can prove that the action (5.120) is independent of the parameters

of ﬁnite SU(3) rotations of the vev constants,

Γ[ ¯W 12, W23; ci, ¯ci] = Γ[ ¯W 12, W23; Λi

jcj, ¯Λj

i ¯cj] ,

(5.125)

63

where Λi
j are SU(3) matrices. As a result, the action (5.120) is independent of any
particular choice of the vacuum ci, ci 6= 0 . Indeed, let us assume, without loss of generality,
that c3 6= 0 . Then, using the coset SU(3)/[U(1)×SU(2)] transformations with a constant
SU(2) doublet as parameters, one can cast ci in the form ci = (0, 0, c3). The constant c3
can be made real by exploiting the residual U(1) transformation (a combination of the
γ5 transformations and those of U(1) from the denominator of SU(3)/[U(1) × SU(2)]).
Finally, it can be rescaled to any non-zero value, keeping in mind that the action is
independent of the rescalings of the vev constants.

5.6 Component structure

5.6.1 F 4/X 4 term

To derive this term from the eﬀective action (5.82), it suﬃces to consider only constant

obtain

In this subsection we assume ci¯ci = 1 for simplicity and use the notation
by (5.101).
F 2 = F αβFαβ , ¯F 2 = ¯F ˙α ˙β ¯F ˙α ˙β .

In (5.127), we have to calculate the harmonic integrals. According to [45], the deﬁni-

tion of harmonic integration over the SU(3) harmonic variables is

From this deﬁnition one can derive the following simple relations

k!(n − k)!(m − k)!(m + n + 2)!(n + 1)(m + 1)

min(m,n)Xk=0
× (φi ¯φi)k(φi¯ci)n−k(ci ¯φi)m−k .

(5.132)

(5.133)

Now we represent (5.127) as a sum of two terms,

ΓF 4/X 4 =

α

2Z d4x F 2 ¯F 2(T1 + T2) ,

where

T1 = Z du
T2 = Z du

∞Xn=0

m!n!

(m + 1)(n + 1)(m + n + 2)!(−1)m+n

m!n!

(φ1¯c1)n( ¯φ3c3)m .

(5.134)

The reason for this separation is that the monomials with m ≤ n are in T1 , while those
with m > n are in T2. Therefore, for each of these two terms we can apply the equation
(5.132) for the harmonic integrals,

T1 = 2

T2 = 2

(m + n − l + 1)!(−1)m+n+l

l!(n − l)!(m − l)!

(φi ¯φi)l(φi¯ci)n−l(ci ¯φi)m−l .(5.135)

Changing the order of summation, these terms can be rewritten as

T1 = 2

T2 = 2

∞Xn=m

(n + m + l + 1)!(−1)m+n+l

l!m!n!

(φi ¯φi)l(φi ¯φi)n(ci ¯φi)m .

(5.136)

65

Putting these two expressions together, we ﬁnd

T1 + T2 = 2

∞Xm,n,k=0

m!n!k!

(ci ¯φi)m(¯ciφi)n( ¯φiφi)k

(ϕi ¯ϕi)2 .
As a result, the F 4/X 4 term in the eﬀective action reads

(1 + ci ¯φi + ¯ciφi + φi ¯φi)2

=

ΓF 4/X 4 = αZ d4x

F 2 ¯F 2
(ϕi ¯ϕi)2 .

This expression is explicitly scale and U(3) invariant, as expected.

(5.137)

(5.138)

It is a highly non-trivial and remarkable phenomenon that the vev constants ci and
the shifted scalars φi have combined into the initial scalar ﬁelds ϕi, (5.77), after doing the
Grassmann and harmonic integrals which is a rather involved procedure in its own. This
conﬁrms the independence of the action (5.82) of any particular choice of the vacua, the
fact that has been proved in the previous section.

Note that (5.138) also respects hidden SO(6) ≃ SU(4) invariance, with the SU(4)/U(3)

transformations acting as

δϕi = εiklλk ¯ϕl ,

δ ¯ϕi = εikl

¯λkϕl ,

(5.139)

where λi comprise 6 corresponding group parameters. This is an indication that the
superﬁeld eﬀective action (5.82), besides the superconformal SU(2, 2|3) symmetry, enjoys
on shell the SU(4) symmetry, and hence, the superconformal P SU(2, 2|4) symmetry as a
closure of these two symmetries.

5.6.2 Wess-Zumino term

To single out the Wess-Zumino term, it is enough to keep only scalar ﬁelds in the super-
ﬁelds (5.25),

ˆω23 = φ1 + iθα

ˆ¯ω12 = ¯φ3 − iθα

We substitute these superﬁelds into the action (5.82) and integrate there over the Grass-
mann variables, keeping only those terms which contain four derivatives contracted with
the antisymmetric ε-symbol,

To compare this expression with the standard expression (2.13) for Wess-Zumino term,15

it is very diﬃcult to ﬁnd the explicit expression for the integral

Then it is straightforward to see that only the ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. of (5.144) contributes
to (5.143), while all other terms either vanish after contracting the indices, or form total
derivatives. As the result, eq. (5.143) can be rewritten as

Here the ﬁelds φi are related with ϕi as in (5.77) and we assumed that ci¯ci = 1 .

Let us single out, in the series (5.146), the terms with minimal numbers of ﬁelds φi
and ¯φi. These terms correspond to the choice m = n = 0 and l = 1 in the second line in

15To be precise, we compare (5.141) with the Wess-Zumino action in the four-dimensional form (3.44).

This identity allows us to bring the action (5.147) to the form

ΓWZ =

This expression coincides with (5.145) under the choice

This proves that the action (5.82) contains the Wess-Zumino term (3.44).

6 Low-energy eﬀective action in N = 4 U Sp(4)

harmonic superspace

The USp(4) harmonic variables were introduced for the ﬁrst time in [71]. Later they
were used in [72] to formulate a superparticle model in N = 4 harmonic superspace16
and to study the N = 4 SYM theory with central charge [76]. The underlying harmonic
superspace proved very eﬃcient for the construction of the N = 4 SYM low-energy
eﬀective action, as was shown in [26]. In this section we review the basic results of the
latter work.

6.1 N = 4 U Sp(4) harmonic superspace
The standard N = 4 superspace is parametrized by the coordinates (4.1), where the
indices i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 correspond to the SU(4) R-symmetry group. The covariant spinor
α and ¯Di ˙α in this superspace have the form (4.4) and obey the commutation
derivatives Di
relations (4.5). The basic idea of the USp(4) harmonic superspace is to abandon the
manifest SU(4) symmetry and keep only the explicit invariance under USp(4) ⊂ SU(4).
Then, we extend the standard N = 4 superspace by the harmonic coordinates uI
i =
(u1

i) which form the USp(4) matrices

i, u4

i, u2

i, u3

16Note that the relativistic particle models in the N = 2 and N = 3 harmonic superspaces were studied

in [73, 74] and [75], respectively.

though other forms are also possible. Being an invariant tensor of the group USp(4) , Ωik
can be used to raise and lower the USp(4) indices, e.g.,

uIi = ΩijuI

j ,

uI

i = ΩijuIj ,

where Ωij is the inverse of Ωij,

ΩijΩjk = δi
k .

(6.3)

(6.4)

The group USp(4) contains two independent U(1) subgroups. These subgroups can
be chosen in such a way that the harmonic variables have the following U(1) charge
assignment

It is easy to check that they obey the commutation relations of the Lie algebra usp(4).
In particular, the operators S1 and S2 are the generators of the two U(1) subgroups, and
they count the corresponding harmonic U(1) charges

[S1, D(s1,s2)] = s1D(s1,s2) ,

[S2, D(s1,s2)] = s2D(s1,s2) ,

[S1, S2] = 0 .

[D(0,++), D(0,−−)] = S2 .

(6.12)

It is also easy to check that any operators from the set {D(++,0), D(−−,0), S1} commute with
those from the set {D(0,++), D(0,−−), S2} . Thus, these sets form two independent mutually
commuting su(2) subalgebras in the full usp(4) algebra of the harmonic derivatives.

The harmonic variables and the matrix Ω reveal the following complex conjugation

properties

(u(±,0)

i

) = ∓u(∓,0)i ,

(u(0,±)

i

) = ∓u(0,∓)i ,

(Ωij) = −Ωij .

(6.13)

As was already mentioned earlier, the conventional complex conjugation is not too useful
in the harmonic superspace, since it does not allow to ensure reality for the analytic
subspaces of the full superspace. In the harmonic superspace approach, it is customary

to use the generalized e -conjugation which, in the present case, is deﬁned to act on the

harmonics by the rules

6.2 N = 4 SYM constraints in the U Sp(4) harmonic superspace

Within the standard geometric approach, the gauge theory is introduced through adding
gauge connections to the superspace derivatives, as in eq. (4.38). The N = 4 SYM
constraints have the same form as in the N = 3 case (5.19), but the indices i, j take now
the values 1, 2, 3, 4.
In the abelian case, these constraints imply the following Bianchi
identities

(6.20a)

(6.20b)

Besides this, the N = 4 superﬁeld strengths W ij = −W ji should be subject to the reality
condition which is a superﬁeld counterpart of (2.1):

W ij = ¯Wij =

1
2

εijklW kl .

(6.21)

71

The constraints (6.20) and (6.21) can be rewritten in N = 4 harmonic superspaces
based on diﬀerent cosets of the SU(4) group [77, 78, 68]. The aim of the present sub-
section is to rewrite them in the USp(4) harmonic superspace introduced in the previous
subsection.

Given the N = 4 superﬁeld strength W ij , we can project it on the harmonics:

W IJ = uI

iuJ

jW ij .

(6.22)

Recall that the harmonic variables have the U(1)-charge assignment indicated in eq. (6.5).
Then, the corresponding charges of W IJ are

W 12 = W , W 13 = W (+,+) , W 14 = W (+,−) ,
W 23 = W (−,+) , W 24 = W (−,−) , W 34 = W ,

(6.23)

where W and W are two diﬀerent uncharged projections

S1W = S2W = 0 ,

S1W = S2W = 0 .
u(0,−)
j W ij. By construction, this superﬁeld

(6.24)

Let us examine the superﬁeld W = u(0,+)

i

obeys the following equations with the harmonic derivatives (6.10)

D(++,0)W = D(−−,0)W = D(0,++)W = D(0,−−)W = 0 ,
(D(+,+))2W = 0 .

The equations (6.20b) imply certain analyticity properties for W

α W = D(0,−)
D(0,+)

α W = ¯D(+,0)

˙α W = ¯D(−,0)

˙α W = 0 .

Eq. (6.21) means that W is real under the e -conjugation (6.14):

(6.25a)

(6.25b)

(6.26)

(6.27)

fW = W .

In a similar way one can ﬁnd the equations for all other superﬁeld strengths (6.23), see
[72] for details.

It is instructive to consider the equations (6.25) and (6.26) in the analytic basis. As
follows from (6.18), the constraints (6.26) are automatically solved by an arbitrary real
analytic W

W = W(ζ, u) .

(6.28)

The equations (6.25a) are not dynamical, since the harmonic derivatives D(±±,0) and
D(0,±±) in the analytic coordinates do not contain ∂/∂xm
A , see (6.19). These equations
serve to eliminate auxiliary ﬁelds in the component ﬁeld expansion of W, but they do

72

not impose any constraint on the physical components. Only eq. (6.25b) is dynamical:
It leads to the standard free equations of motion for physical components in W. The
solution of the total set of equations (6.25)–(6.27) is given by the following component
ﬁeld expansions:

reasons, it is useful to express Wbos in terms of SO(5) harmonic variables. Recall also
that the representation 5 of USp(4) ≃ SO(5) is given by the antisymmetric Ω-traceless
4 × 4 matrix. The corresponding Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients are gamma matrices γij

We will use this form of the superﬁeld strength in subsection 6.4 for studying the bosonic
component structure of the low-energy eﬀective action in N = 4 SYM theory.

6.3 Scale invariant low-energy eﬀective action

In general, the four-derivative part of the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action can be
represented by the following functional in the N = 4 superspace

Γ =Z dζdu H(W) ,

(6.42)

(6.43)

(6.44)

where dζ is the measure of integration over the analytic subspace with the coordinates
(6.16). We assume that this measure is deﬁned so that

and the integration over the harmonic variables is deﬁned by the standard rules

dζ = d4xAd8θ ,

Z d8θ(θ(+,0))2(θ(−,0))2(¯θ(0,+))2(¯θ(0,−))2 = 1 ,
Z du(non-singlet USp(4) irreducible representation) = 0 .

Z du 1 = 1 ,

As is seen from (6.43), the analytic measure is uncharged and dimensionless. Eﬀectively,
it contains eight covariant spinor derivatives which produce four space-time derivatives on
the component ﬁelds. Hence, all the space-time derivatives in (6.42) are already hidden
in the superspace measure and the function H(W) should contain neither space-time,
nor covariant spinor derivatives of the superﬁeld strength W. This is very similar to
the situation with the eﬀective action in the N = 2 and N = 3 harmonic superspaces
considered in the previous sections.

Now we implement the requirement of scale invariance of the eﬀective action Γ. The
function H(W) should be dimensionless, since the analytic measure (6.43) has the di-
mension zero, but the superﬁeld strength W has the dimension one. Thus, we are led to
introduce a parameter Λ, such that W/Λ is dimensionless, and to choose

H(W, Λ) = H(W/Λ) .

75

(6.45)

Since the dependence on Λ must disappear upon doing the integration over superspace,
the function H is uniquely determined to be

H = c ln W

Λ

,

(6.46)

where c is some constant coeﬃcient. Rescaling W amounts to shifting H by a constant,
which yields zero under the dζ integral.

We conclude that the four-derivative part of the SYM eﬀective action on the Coulomb

branch in N = 4 USp(4) harmonic superspace has the following simple unique form

Γ = cZ dζdu ln W

Λ

.

(6.47)

We will show that this action contains the F 4/X 4 term (2.11), as well as the Wess-Zumino
term (3.14). This will allow us to ﬁx the coeﬃcient c.

6.4 Component structure

6.4.1 F 4/X 4 term

In order to identify the F 4/X 4 term (2.11) it is suﬃcient to consider the bosonic part of
the superﬁeld strength, Wbos (6.29b). Recall that it can be rewritten through the SO(5)
harmonic variables, see (6.41). Hence, for deriving the F 4/X 4 term we substitute (6.41)
into (6.47) and replace the integration measure du by dv ,

ΓF 4/X 4 = cZ dζdv ln Wbos

Λ

.

(6.48)

Moreover, it suﬃces to consider Wbos with constant scalar ﬁelds ϕ and Xa. Then only
the ﬁrst line in (6.41) survives. Substituting this simpliﬁed expression for Wbos into the
action (6.48) and integrating there over θ’s by the rule (6.43), we ﬁnd

ΓF 4/X 4 =

4Z d4xdv H(4)(ϕ + iXav5

a)hFmnF nkFklF lm −

(FpqF pq)2i,

where H(n) stands for the n’th derivative of H with respect to its argument. To compute
the harmonic integral, we expand H(4) in the Taylor series,

(6.49)

(6.50)

H(4)(ϕ + iXav5

a) =

1
n!H(4+n)(ϕ)(iXav5

Applying (6.39) to each term in this series, we obtain

ΓF 4/X 4 =

Thus, the superﬁeld action (6.47) contains the F 4/X 4 term (2.11).

(6.54)

6.4.2 Wess-Zumino term

Recall that the Wess-Zumino term (3.14) depends only on the scalar ﬁelds and their
derivatives. Hence, for singling out this term in the component ﬁeld representation of
(6.47) it is enough to use the same superﬁeld expression (6.48), but in the superﬁeld
(6.41) we now need to keep only the scalar ﬁelds. Then, performing integration over θ’s
by the rule (6.43), we ﬁnd

Γ = Z d4xdv H(4)(ϕ + iXev5

To extract the Wess-Zumino term from (6.55), we point out that the Levi-Civita tensor
εmnpq can arise only from the cyclic contraction of the spinor indices on four x-derivatives
∂’s, recall (4.97). In addition, if two ∂’s act on the same object, no contribution to the
Wess-Zumino term appears, since εmnpq∂m∂n vanishes. Therefore, only the ﬁrst integral

ϕ = X6 and take c as in (6.54).

7 Low-energy eﬀective action in N = 4 SU (2) × SU (2)

harmonic superspace

In section 3 we discussed various forms of the Wess-Zumino term in the N = 4 SYM
eﬀective action and showed that there exist four diﬀerent representations of this term
which are associated with four maximal subgroups of SU(4) listed in (3.45).
In the
previous sections we presented three diﬀerent superspace formulations of the N = 4
SYM low-energy eﬀective action which correspond to three diﬀerent forms of the Wess-
Zumino term. Namely, the N = 2 harmonic superspace gives the Wess-Zumino term in
the SO(4) × SO(2) covariant form, the N = 3 harmonic superspace corresponds to the
SU(3)× U(1) covariant form of the Wess-Zumino term, while the N = 4 superspace with
USp(4) harmonic variables gives rise to the Wess-Zumino term with manifest SO(5). The
last option in the list (3.45) is the group SO(3) × SO(3) which is locally isomorphic to
SU(2)× SU(2). In the present section we will show that this case is naturally reproduced
within the formulation of the low-energy eﬀective action in the N = 4 superspace equipped
with SU(2) × SU(2) harmonic variables. This formulation was developed in [25].

7.1 N = 4 bi-harmonic superspace
In the present section we will consider the N = 4 harmonic superspace which is based on
the harmonic variables for the maximal subgroup SU(2)× SU(2) of SU(4). In [25] it was

78

christened the bi-harmonic N = 4 superspace, by analogy with the earlier works, where
this kind of harmonic variables appeared [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85].

The basic idea is to give up the manifest SU(4) symmetry of N = 4 SYM theory
and use a superspace formulation which keeps manifest only the maximal SU(2)× SU(2)
subgroup of SU(4) and employs two independent sets of SU(2) harmonic variables for
this subgroup.17 In this section, we change our conventions for the indices: The SU(4)
indices will be denoted by capital letters I, J, K, . . . , while the indices of the two SU(2)’s
will be represented by i, j, k, . . . and ˜i, ˜j, ˜k, . . ., respectively. Then, every SU(4) index I is
replaced by a pair of SU(2) indices (i,˜i)

I = (i,˜i) = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)} .

(7.1)

For instance, the Grassmann variables θα
θα
i˜i

, respectively. The SU(2) indices are raised and lowered by the standard rules, e.g.

I and ¯θI ˙α = θα

I are now labeled as θα

i˜i and ¯θi˜i ˙α =

In these new notations, the covariant spinor derivatives are represented as

θi˜i α = εijε˜i˜jθα

which generate two mutually commuting su(2) algebras. The operators S1 and S2 form
u(1) subalgebras in these two su(2)’s and count the U(1) charges of other operators:

[S1, D(s1,s2)] = s1D(s1,s2) ,

[S2, D(s1,s2)] = s2D(s1,s2) .

(7.7)

17In principle, it is possible to deﬁne also another type of bi-harmonic N = 4 superspace by reducing
SU (4) to its SU (2) × SU (2) × U (1) subgroup and harmonizing both SU (2) groups in this product. The
N = 4 SYM eﬀective action in such a superspace is expected to be equivalent to its N = 2 superspace
formulation considered in sect. 4.

In order to be able to deﬁne real structures in harmonic superspaces, one needs the
proper deﬁnition of the generalized conjugation. Recall that in the N = 2 harmonic
superspace such a conjugation is given by the involution (4.18) which is a generalization
of the standard complex conjugation. In the N = 4 bi-harmonic superspace considered
here the analogous operation can be deﬁned in diﬀerent ways. We postulate that the

e -conjugation acts on the u-harmonics by the same rules (4.18), but on the v-harmonics

it is realized as the conventional complex conjugation,

Assuming that all the harmonic-independent objects behave under this conjugation in the

same way as under the complex conjugation, we can specify the e -conjugation properties

By deﬁnition, the full N = 4 bi-harmonic superspace is parametrized by the coordi-

nates

This superspace has several analytic subspaces, each involving eight Grassmann variables
out of sixteen ones. Every analytic subspace is closed under the full supersymmetry. All
these subspaces were considered in detail in [25]. Here we will need only one of them,
parametrized by the coordinates

{ζ, u, v} = {(xm

7.2 N = 4 SYM constraints in bi-harmonic superspace
Recall that the N = 4 SYM constraints are given in the abelian case by eqs. (6.20) and
(6.21). With employing the notations of the present section, they are rewritten as

¯DL ˙αW LJ) ,

(7.21a)

(7.21b)

(7.21c)

Here W IJ = −W JI is the N = 4 superﬁeld strength with SU(4) indices. Representing
the SU(4) indices as pairs of the SU(2) ones, like in (7.1), we ﬁnd

W IJ ≡ W i˜i,j˜j = εijW ˜i˜j + ε˜i˜jW ij ,

(7.22)

so that the superﬁeld strength W IJ is now split into a pair of symmetric SU(2) tensors:
W ˜i˜j = W ˜j˜i and W ij = W ji. The constraints (7.21a)–(7.21c) can be readily rewritten in
terms of these tensors. In particular, using the identity

εIJKL ≡ εi˜i,j˜j,k˜k,l˜l = εilεjkε˜i˜jε˜k˜l − εijεklε˜i˜lε˜j˜k ,

(7.23)

we ﬁnd that the reality condition (7.21c) is equivalent to the following reality properties

W ij ≡ ¯Wij = Wij ,

W ˜i˜j ≡ ¯W˜i˜j = −W˜i˜j .

(7.24)

It is also straightforward to rewrite the constraints (7.21a) and (7.21b) in terms of the
newly introduced superﬁeld strengths

It should be stressed that the equations (7.24), (7.25a) and (7.25b) are equivalent to the
N = 4 SYM constraints (7.21c), (7.21a) and (7.21b).

Now we introduce the harmonic projections of the superﬁelds W ij and W ˜i˜j:

W = u+

i u−
W (2,0) = u+
W (0,2) = v+

j W ij − v+
˜i

j W ij ,
˜j W ˜i˜j ,
˜i v+

W ˜i˜j ,

W ′ = u+

W (0,−2) = v−

j W ij + v+

j W ij ,
˜j W ˜i˜j .
˜i v−

W ˜i˜j ,

v−
˜j

(7.26)

(7.27)

(7.28)

According to the conjugation rules (7.12) and (7.24), these harmonic projections obey the
reality properties:

fW = W , fW ′ = W ′ ,

^
W (±2,0) = W (±2,0) ,

^

W (0,±2) = −W (0,∓2) .

(7.29)

For the goals of the present subsection, we need to consider only one of these su-
perﬁelds, W ; the remaining ones were studied in [25]. In order to ﬁnd the diﬀerential
constraints for this basic superﬁeld, we are led to consider contractions of the equations
(7.25) with various combinations of harmonic variables. As a result, we derive the set of
the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential constraints on W

¯D1

˙αW = D2

αW = D3

αW = ¯D4

˙αW = 0 .

(7.30)

These equations are easily recognized as the analyticity conditions, since the covariant
spinor derivatives appearing in (7.30) become short in the analytic basis, see (7.17). Thus
the general solution of (7.30) is an arbitrary analytic superﬁeld

W = W (xm

A , θ1

α, ¯θ2

˙α, ¯θ3

˙α, θ4

α, u, v) .

(7.31)

It is obvious that there remain many auxiliary ﬁelds in W which should be removed

by the other constraints also following from (7.25):

(D1)2W = ( ¯D2)2W = ( ¯D3)2W = (D4)2W = (D1D4)W = ( ¯D2 ¯D3)W = 0 .

(7.32)

These second-order constraints eliminate the unphysical components in W , but do not
imply any dynamical equations for the physical components. The equations of motion for
the physical components follow from the relations

D(2,0)D(2,0)W = D(0,2)D(0,2)W = D(2,0)D(0,2)W = 0 .

(7.33)

In the central basis, these constraints are satisﬁed for the superﬁelds (7.26) by construc-
tion. However, they become non-trivial dynamical equations in the analytic basis, in
which the harmonic derivatives involve the space-time derivatives, see (7.20).

83

The constraints (7.29), (7.30), (7.32) and (7.33) completely specify the superﬁeld W :

(7.35)

No any auxiliary ﬁeld component is present in W as they all have been eliminated by the
constraints (7.30), (7.32) and (7.33).

The component ﬁeld expansion (7.34b) starts with an arbitrary constant ω. This
constant would have never appeared, had we started with the component form of W IJ
that solves (7.21a)–(7.21c), deﬁned W by the rule (7.26) and then passed to analytic
coordinates.
Instead, here we postulated W to be deﬁned by the constraints (7.29),
(7.30), (7.32), and (7.33). Finally, these constraints proved quite suﬃcient to properly
restrict the component degrees of freedom, except for the residual appearance of an extra
constant parameter ω.

We set ω equal to zero by requiring that W transforms linearly under the scale trans-

formations with a constant parameter λ,

δW = λ W ⇒ ω = 0 .

(7.36)

This requirement is particularly natural for the purposes of the next subsection, where
we will construct the superconformal eﬀective action of N = 4 SYM theory in the bi-
harmonic N = 4 superspace.

Note that the bosonic part of the superﬁeld strength (7.34b) involves only a few har-

7.3 Scale invariant low-energy eﬀective action

We will look for the low-energy eﬀective action in the form of a functional of W

Γ =Z dζdudv H(W ) ,

(7.40)

(7.41)

(7.42)

where H(W ) is some function of W without derivatives. The integration goes over the
analytic superspace (7.15) with the analytic measure deﬁned as

dζ = d4xd8θ ,

Z d8θ (θ1)2(θ4)2(¯θ2)2(¯θ3)2 = 1 .

(7.43)

The integration over harmonic variables du and dv is deﬁned by the same rule (4.32b).
We point out that the function H(W ) must have zero U(1) charges, since the integration
measure dζ of the analytic superspace (7.15) is uncharged.

85

Note that the integration measure (7.43) amounts to eight spinor covariant derivatives,
or, equivalently, to four space-time ones on the component ﬁelds. Therefore, we expect
that the action (7.42) with some appropriate H(W ) describes the four-derivative term
in the N = 4 low-energy eﬀective action, and that this term is the leading one in the
derivative expansion. We will now determine the function H by requiring scale invariance
of the action (7.42), in exactly the same way as we proceeded in sect. 6.3.

As the measure dζ is dimensionless, the function H(W ) must also be dimensionless.
Recalling that the mass dimension of W is one, we are forced to introduce a parameter Λ
such that W/Λ is dimensionless, and choose H = H(W/Λ). However, the dependence on
Λ should disappear after doing the integral over Grassmann variables. This requirement
uniquely ﬁxes the form of the function H,

with some coeﬃcient c. The corresponding low-energy eﬀective action

H = c ln

W
Λ

,

Γ = cZ dζdudv ln

W
Λ

(7.44)

(7.45)

is scale invariant. Indeed, rescaling W shifts the integrand in (7.45) by a constant, which
gives a zero contribution under the Grassmann integral. Thus, the requirement of scale
invariance ﬁxes the form of the low-energy eﬀective action. Surprisingly, this form is very
similar to (6.47).

7.4 Component structure

7.4.1 F 4/X 4 term

To ﬁnd the F 4/X 4 term in the component ﬁeld expansion of the low-energy eﬀective
action (7.45), it suﬃces to substitute in it the bosonic part of the superﬁeld strength W
in the form (7.40),

ΓF 4/X 4 = cZ dζdUdV ln

(7.46)

where we have replaced the integration over the SU(2) harmonics by that over the SO(3)

Comparing (7.63) with (3.22), we observe the perfect agreement between the two expres-
sions, provided that the coeﬃcient c is chosen as in (7.54).

Thus in this section we demonstrated that the superﬁeld functional (7.42) does con-
tain, in its component structure, the F 4/X 4 and Wess-Zumino terms as the necessary
ingredients of the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action.
In principle, it is possible
to explicitly compute all other component terms in the action (7.42) needed to complete
these selected bosonic terms to the full N = 4 supersymmetry invariants.

8 Concluding remarks

The present review was devoted to the problem of constructing the low-energy eﬀective
action in N = 4 SYM theory, based upon the powerful oﬀ- and on-shell superﬁeld methods
of extended supersymmetry. The consideration was basically concentrated around the
papers [21, 24, 25, 26], in which the four-derivative part of the low-energy eﬀective action
in the Coulomb branch was studied. This part of the eﬀective action represents the
leading quantum correction in the theory. Although it was known for a long time that
this contribution to the eﬀective action is one-loop exact [12, 13, 32] and does not receive
instanton corrections [34], only some selected terms in the action were studied before. In
particular, in the papers [35, 14, 15, 16, 18] there was considered that part of the N = 4
SYM eﬀective action, which refers to the N = 2 vector multiplet. The derivation of
the completely N = 4 supersymmetric extension of these results appeared a quite non-
trivial problem. It was resolved in [21, 24, 25, 26], with making use of diﬀerent harmonic
superspace approaches. It turned out that the corresponding superﬁeld eﬀective action
can be restored solely on the symmetry ground, by requiring it to enjoy the N = 4

89

supersymmetry and/or superconformal P SU(2, 2|4) symmetry. Although only some part
of the underlying supersymmetries can be realized oﬀ shell (N = 2 supersymmetry in
the N = 2 harmonic approach and N = 3 supersymmetry in the N = 3 harmonic
approach), the on-shell realization of the remaining part proved quite suﬃcient to fully
ﬁx the superﬁeld eﬀective actions.

Dine and Seiberg [12] argued that the F 4/X 4 term in the low-energy eﬀective action
of N = 4 SYM theory is one-loop exact, so that the coeﬃcient in front of this term is
non-renormalized against higher-order quantum loop corrections. The origin of this non-
renormalizability was clariﬁed in [24]. It is very important to realize that the N = 4 SYM
low-energy eﬀective action contains the Wess-Zumino term [19] for six scalar ﬁelds of the
N = 4 gauge multiplet. This Wess-Zumino term is obviously one-loop exact because it
appears in the Coulomb branch as the necessary consequence of the anomaly-matching
condition for the SU(4) R-symmetry [20]. Because this term involves four space-time
derivatives of scalars, it is of the same order as the F 4/X 4 term. Thus, these two terms
are related to each other by N = 4 supersymmetry and are, in fact, diﬀerent components
of the same superﬁeld expression for the four-derivative part of the low-energy eﬀective
action [24]. This explains the non-renormalizability of the coeﬃcient in the F 4/X 4 term.
The presence of the potential anomaly of the SU(4) R-symmetry current in N = 4
SYM theory was explicitly demonstrated in [54]. Therefore, the eﬀective Lagrangian is
invariant under SU(4) only up to the total derivative terms. The SU(4) ∼ SO(6) group
has four maximal subgroups: SO(5) ∼ USp(4), SO(4)× SO(2) ∼ SU(2)× SU(2)× U(1),
SO(3) × SO(3) ∼ SU(2) × SU(2) and SU(3) × U(1). Only the last of these groups is
anomalous, while the others are not. As a consequence, only the ﬁrst three groups can
appear as the manifest symmetry of the eﬀective action. As we showed in the present
paper, each of these subgroups correspond to a particular superspace description of the
N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action. In particular, the SU(2)× SU(2)× U(1) group is
manifest in the N = 2 harmonic superspace, the group USp(4) is manifest in the N = 4
superspace equipped with USp(4) harmonic variables, while the group SU(2) × SU(2)
corresponds to the N = 4 bi-harmonic superspace. The last option SU(3) × U(1) is the
R-symmetry group of the N = 3 harmonic superspace.

Each of the four superspace approaches considered here has its own speciﬁc features.
The N = 4 harmonic superspaces with USp(4) and SU(2) × SU(2) harmonic variables
provide the most elegant description of the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action: the
eﬀective Lagrangian is given simply by the logarithm of the uncharged N = 4 superﬁeld
strength. All four-derivative component terms in the low-energy eﬀective action prove to
be encapsulated in this simple superﬁeld expression.

The eﬀective Lagrangian in the N = 3 harmonic superspace is still simple enough as

90

it is expressed in terms of elementary functions, but it explicitly involves the constants
ci which correspond to the vevs of the scalars ﬁelds ϕi. These constants break manifest
SU(3) symmetry, although the latter is implicitly realized modulo total derivative terms.
This is a manifestation of the fact that the SU(3) subgroup of the R-symmetry group
is anomalous in N = 4 gauge theory. An important advantage of the N = 3 harmonic
superspace is that, in principle, it provides a way to realize the maximal number of
supersymmetries oﬀ the mass shell owing to the existence of an unconstrained superﬁeld
formulation of the N = 3 SYM classical action in this superspace [46, 47].

The N = 2 harmonic superspace is the most deeply elaborated approach among all the
superspace approaches discussed here. In particular, the quantum perturbation theory
is well developed in it [62, 17]. These perturbative methods were applied in [27, 28, 29]
for direct computations of the low-energy eﬀective action in N = 4 SYM theory.
In
principle, this approach opens the ways to study higher-order quantum corrections to the
low-energy eﬀective action in N = 4 SYM theory [86, 87]. However, this issue is very
subtle and below we will only brieﬂy comment on it.

Let us dwell on possible generalizations of the results reviewed here.
In the present paper we considered only the gauge group SU(2) spontaneously broken
It is rather trivial to generalize it to an arbitrary simple Lie group G
down to U(1).
broken down to its maximal abelian subgroup H. For instance, consider the gauge group
G = SU(N) spontaneously broken down to H = [U(1)]N −1. The N = 4 superﬁeld W in
this case is the diagonal N × N matrix in the Cartan subalgebra of su(N) ,

W = diag(W 1, W 2, . . . W N ) ,

W i = 0 ,

(8.1)

NXi=1

with all eigenvalues being distinct, W i 6= W j for i 6= j. Then the eﬀective action (6.47)
generalizes to this case as

Γ = −

96π2Z dζdu

NXi<j

ln |W i − W j|

Λ

.

(8.2)

Here W i − W j correspond to root subspaces in the Lie algebra su(N) of the gauge group
and the summation is performed over the positive roots. Taking this into account, one
can immediately write down the low-energy eﬀective action in N = 4 SYM theory for
any other simple gauge group. In the same manner one can generalize all other superﬁeld
actions (4.93), (5.104) and (7.45) considered in this paper.

Another possible generalization is the study of the next-to-leading terms in the N = 4
SYM low-energy eﬀective action.
Indeed, in this paper we considered only the four-
derivative part of the eﬀective action, the typical representative of which is the F 4/X 4

91

component term. In general, the eﬀective action contains the terms F 2n+2/X 2n, n ∈ ,
with all their supersymmetric complements. The interest in these terms is motivated by
the AdS/CFT conjecture [88, 6, 11], which predicts that the N = 4 SYM low-energy
eﬀective action is related to the D3-brane action in AdS5 × S5. The latter is described by
the following action in the bosonic sector

SD3 =

1

2πgsZ d4x(cid:16)h−1 −p− det(gmn + Fmn)(cid:17) ,

gmn = h−1/2ηmn + h1/2∂mX I∂nX I ,

h =

gsN

π(X IX I)2 ,

(8.3)

where X I are six coordinates transverse to the world-volume of the D3-brane, N is the
number of D3-branes which create the background AdS5 × S5 geometry and gs is the
string coupling constant. Upon the series expansion of the square root of the determinant
in (8.3), one uncovers all terms of the form F 2n+2/X 2n, which are present in the N = 4
In this expansion, the F 2 term is a part of the abelian
SYM eﬀective action as well.
N = 4 SYM classical action, while the F 4/X 4 term should originate from the low-energy
eﬀective action described in the present paper. After the appropriate redeﬁnition of the
constants in (8.3), the coeﬃcients before its F 2 and F 4/X 4 terms exactly match those in
the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action.

However, it is hard to match the higher order terms in these actions. This problem
is multi-fold. It is quite obvious that (8.3) cannot exactly match the N = 4 SYM low-
energy eﬀective action in the bosonic sector. Indeed, the D3-brane action (8.3) involves
only the ﬁrst space-time derivatives of physical scalars, while the N = 4 SYM low-energy
eﬀective action in any superﬁeld formulation discussed here inevitably contains higher-
order derivatives of the scalars. Thus, these actions can coincide only upon the appropriate
redeﬁnition of ﬁelds,

X ′I = X ′I(X I, ∂mX i, ∂m∂nX I, Fmn, . . .) ,
F ′
mn = F ′
mn(Fmn, X I, ∂mX I, ∂m∂nX I, . . .) .

(8.4)

Such a redeﬁnition was worked out to some order in [89], but in general, it is still a non-
trivial issue which has never been presented in literature in a closed form. The reason
for such a ﬁeld redeﬁnition was explained in [90]: the superconformal group SU(2, 2|4) is
realized diﬀerently on the ﬁelds inherent to the ﬁeld theory and those appearing in the
AdS settings.

The problem of higher-order terms in the low-energy eﬀective action is even more
subtle. Diﬀerent superspace methods of quantum computations of the coeﬃcient in the
F 6/X 8 term used in [86, 87] (N = 1) and [91] (N = 2) give diﬀerent results. This
mismatch is explained [87] by the fact that in distinct superﬁeld methods diﬀerent gauges

92

are applied and it is very diﬃcult to perform higher-loop quantum computations in a
gauge-independent way.
In [92] it was also argued that the higher-order terms can be
found by employing the quantum-deformed conformal symmetry.

To understand this issue better, it would be interesting to develop the methods of
computations of quantum corrections to the eﬀective action in the N = 3 harmonic
superspace. Although the basic principles of quantum perturbation theory in this su-
perspace were formulated in [66], the background ﬁeld method has never been worked
out in the N = 3 superﬁeld approach. Given the N = 3 superﬁeld background ﬁeld
method, it would be possible to check the conjecture made in [26] that the F 6/X 8 term
does not receive quantum corrections beyond one loop and the correct value of this coeﬃ-
cient appears after elimination of all auxiliary ﬁelds in the N = 3 eﬀective action (5.104)
considered together with the classical action (5.63) in the abelian case.

It is also tempting to develop alternative superspace methods for studying classical and
quantum aspects of the N = 4 SYM theory. For instance, in the recent papers [93, 94]
the so-called Lorentz harmonic chiral superspace was proposed for computing certain
classes of correlation functions. It would be very interesting to apply this approach to the
problem of low-energy eﬀective action in the N = 4 SYM theory.

The relation of the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action to the D3-brane dynamics
discussed above suggests that a similar correspondence can be established for supersym-
metric gauge theories in space-times of dimension other than four.
In particular, the
low-energy dynamics of multiple M2-branes in M-theory can be understood through the
three-dimensional superconformal gauge theories with N = 6 and N = 8 supersymme-
tries, which are known as the ABJM [95] and BLG [96, 97, 98] theories.
In [99] it is
conjectured that the low-energy eﬀective action in the ABJM theory should describe the
eﬀective dynamics of single M2-brane on the AdS4 × S7 background, in a similar way
as the N = 4 SYM low-energy eﬀective action is related to the D3-brane. In the three-
dimensional case, this conjecture has never been tested. We expect that the extended
superspace methods could be useful for solving this problem. For the Lagrangians of the
ABJM and BLG theories, the 3D N = 3 harmonic superspace [100] seems to provide
the highest number of oﬀ-shell supersymmetries (see also [101] for a recent discussion).
It would be interesting to study the superﬁeld low-energy eﬀective action in the ABJM
theory.

As the ﬁnal remark, we point out that the harmonic superspace methods turned out

supersymmetric models [102, 103, 104].
