ABSTRACT
We present galaxy-galaxy lensing results from 139 square degrees of Dark Energy Survey
(DES) Science Veriﬁcation (SV) data. Our lens sample consists of red galaxies, known as
redMaGiC, which are speciﬁcally selected to have a low photometric redshift error and out-
lier rate. The lensing measurement has a total signal-to-noise of 29, including all lenses over
a wide redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.8. Dividing the lenses into three redshift bins, we ﬁnd no
evidence for evolution in the halo mass with redshift. We obtain consistent results for the lens-
ing measurement with two independent shear pipelines, ngmix and im3shape. We perform
a number of null tests on the shear and photometric redshift catalogs and quantify resulting
systematic errors. Covariances from jackknife subsamples of the data are validated with a
suite of 50 mock surveys. The results and systematics checks in this work provide a critical
input for future cosmological and galaxy evolution studies with the DES data and redMaGiC
galaxy samples. We ﬁt a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model, and demonstrate that
our data constrains the mean halo mass of the lens galaxies, despite strong degeneracies be-
tween individual HOD parameters.

INTRODUCTION

Weak gravitational lensing refers to the subtle distortions in the im-
ages of distant galaxies by intervening mass along the line of sight.
The measurement of lensing around foreground (lens) galaxies is
referred to as galaxy-galaxy lensing (Tyson et al. 1984; Brainerd et
al. 1996; dell’Antonio & Tyson 1996). Background (source) galax-
ies are binned in annuli on the sky centered on lens galaxies; the
shapes of the background galaxies are projected along the tangen-
tial direction and averaged over a population of lens galaxies. The
measurement as a function of angular separation can be converted

into an estimate of the projected mass proﬁle of the dark matter
halos where the galaxies reside.

Galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements have been used to in-
fer the mass distribution within the halos of massive galaxies, the
relation of mass to light, the shapes of the halos, and the large-
scale galaxy-mass cross-correlation (Sheldon et al. 2004; Mandel-
baum et al. 2006, 2008; Cacciato et al. 2009). The measurements
have many applications, ranging from ﬁtting Navarro Frenk White
(NFW) halo mass proﬁles (Navarro et al. 1997) to estimating the
large-scale bias of galaxies and obtaining cosmological constraints
(Cacciato et al. 2009; Mandelbaum et al. 2013; More et al. 2015).

Clampitt et al.

Recent surveys such as CFHTLenS (Heymans et al. 2012; Erben et
al. 2013) have presented measurements on galaxy-galaxy lensing
(Gillis et al. 2013; Velander et al. 2014; Hudson et al. 2015). Simi-
larly, measurements from KiDS (de Jong et al. 2013; Kuijken et al.
2015) have also studied the galaxy-mass connection using galaxy-
galaxy lensing (Sif´on et al. 2015; Viola et al. 2015; van Uitert et al.
2016). The galaxy-mass connection has also been studied at high
redshift by Leauthaud et al. (2012).

In this paper we measure galaxy-galaxy lensing from Dark
Energy Survey (DES) pre-survey Science Veriﬁcation (SV) data.
DES is an ongoing wide-ﬁeld multi-band imaging survey that will
cover nearly 5000 square degrees of the Southern sky over ﬁve
years. With this pre-survey SV data, our goals are to establish the
feasibility of measuring galaxy-galaxy lensing with DES, test our
measurement pipelines, and make an estimate of the halo proper-
ties for a selected galaxy sample. The detailed tests presented serve
as a necessary foundation for other work relying on galaxy-galaxy
lensing measurements with these data. In particular, Kwan et al.
(in prep) obtains constraints on cosmological parameters using the
combination of galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering infor-
mation with the same data used in this work. Baxter et al. (2016)
presents complementary cosmological and systematic constraints
using the combination of galaxy-galaxy lensing and CMB lens-
ing. Prat et al. (in prep) measures galaxy-galaxy lensing around a
magnitude-limited sample of DES-SV galaxies in order to measure
their large-scale bias. Finally, tangential shear measurements of un-
derdensities such as troughs (Gruen et al. 2015) and voids (S´anchez
et al. in prep) also beneﬁt from the tests in this work.

The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 summarizes the
basic theory of galaxy-mass correlations and our Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) model. Section 3 describes our data: includ-
ing basic details of DES, descriptions of the lens galaxy sample,
pipelines for source galaxy shape measurements, and the photomet-
ric redshift estimation of lens and source galaxies. Our estimators
and measurement methodology are presented in Section 4. Results
of null tests that establish the suitability of the shear and photo-z
catalogs for galaxy-galaxy lensing are presented in Section 5. Our
measurement results and HOD model ﬁts are in Section 6, as well
as discussion of related results in the literature. We conclude in
Section 7.

2 WEAK-LENSING THEORY AND THE HALO MODEL

Galaxy-galaxy lensing involves the distortion of background
galaxy images in the presence of foreground dark matter halos,
which are occupied by the lens galaxies. This distortion makes the
background galaxy image stretch tangentially to the line joining
the background and foreground galaxies. The magnitude of this
tangential shear, γt(θ), and of the related excess surface density,
∆Σ(R), provides a means of learning about the local dark matter
proﬁle and galaxy environment.

We relate the properties of lens galaxies to the underlying dark
matter distribution through Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)
modeling (Zheng et al. 2005; Zehavi et al. 2011). The HOD model
assigns each dark matter halo a probability of hosting N galaxies,
P (N|Mh), that is dependent on the halo mass, Mh. The galaxy
population is divided into centrals, which are generally luminous
galaxies that are located at or near the center of the halo, and satel-
lites, less luminous galaxies which populate the outskirts of the
halo. Each halo is allowed only one central but can have multi-
ple satellites. We follow the HOD parameterization of Zehavi et

(cid:10)N (Mh|M t

al. (2011): assuming a log-normal mass-luminosity distribution for
central galaxies and a power-law distribution for satellite galaxies.
The expectation value for the number of galaxies for a luminosity
thresholded sample (with absolute r-band magnitude Mr < M t
r)
is parameterized as

with model parameters Mmin, M1, σlogM , α, fcen. For a DES
simulation-based study using a similar HOD model, see Park et
al. (2015). For simplicity we set the satellite cut-off scale of Zheng
et al. (2005) to zero, as it is not constrained by our data.

The central galaxy occupation is described by a softened step
function with two parameters: (i) a transition mass scale Mmin,
which is the halo mass at which the median central galaxy lumi-
nosity corresponds to the luminosity threshold, and (ii) a soften-
ing parameter σlogM related to the scatter between galaxy lumi-
nosity and halo mass. The normalization of the satellite occupation
function is M1 and α is the high-mass slope of the satellite oc-
cupation function. Finally, we introduce an additional parameter,
fcen, the fraction of occupied halos, which allows us to relax the
assumption that every halo above a certain mass contains a central
galaxy. This parametrization (with fcen = 1) is able to reproduce
the clustering of CFHTLS and SDSS galaxies over a large range
of redshifts and luminosity thresholds (Zheng et al. 2005; Zehavi
et al. 2011). redMaGiC galaxies are not quite complete to a lumi-
nosity threshold: they were selected using a cut in color space and
this prompted the inclusion of fcen as an additional free parameter.
However, to obtain strong constraints on fcen, we would need to use
the observed number density of galaxies as an additional constraint.
The priors used for each parameter are summarized in Table 1. We
choose priors based on earlier work with red galaxies: fcen from
redMaPPer (Rykoff et al. 2014, 2016); 0.01 < σlogM < 0.5 and
0.4 < log M1 − log Mmin < 1.6 from Brown et al. (2008); α
from White et al. (2011) and Parejko et al. (2013). In addition, we
checked that widening the priors for all parameters does not effect
our main results in Sec. 6.2.

The HOD model allows us to predict, on average, the num-
ber of galaxies contained within each halo of a given mass. To-
gether with the halo mass function, which tells us how many halos
of each mass bin to expect within a given volume, and the halo
model (Cooray & Sheth 2002), we can predict the expected clus-
tering of these galaxies and their dark matter halos. On large scales,
correlations between dark matter and galaxies in different halos
dominates and can be approximated by the 2-halo matter-galaxy
cross power spectrum as follows:

gm(k, z) ≈ bgalPm(k, z),
P 2h

(2)

where Pm(k, z) is the linear dark matter power spectrum and the
mean galaxy bias, bgal, is supplied by the HOD model as:

The tangential shear is related to the excess surface density, ∆Σ, as
∆Σ(R|z) = ¯Σ(< R) − Σ(R)

= Σcrit(z, zs) γt(R|z, zs) ,

(11)
(12)

where Σ(R) is the surface mass density at the transverse separation
R from the center of the halo and ¯Σ(< R) its mean within R.
Finally, we integrate over the redshift distribution of lens galaxies,
n(z), to obtain

(cid:104)∆Σ(R)(cid:105) =

¯n

dz n(z) ∆Σ(R|z) .

(13)

∆Σ is a physical property of the lens and so does not depend on
the source galaxies: this is clear from Eq. (11) in which ∆Σ can
be determined completely from the projected mass density Σ. This
independence from source redshifts is less obvious in Eq. (12), but
note the Σcrit(z, zs) factor cancels with the same factor in Eq. (8).

3 DATA

The Dark Energy Survey is an ongoing wide-ﬁeld multi-band
imaging survey that will cover nearly 5000 square degrees of the
Southern sky over ﬁve years. The Dark Energy Camera (DECam,
Flaugher et al. 2015) holds sixty-two 2048x4096 science CCDs,
four 2048x2048 guider CCDs, and eight 2048x2048 focus and
alignment chips, for a total of 570 megapixels covering a roughly
hexagonal footprint. Five ﬁlters are used during normal survey op-
erations, g, r, i, z, Y . The main survey will cover about 5000 square
degrees in the South Galactic Cap region, with approximately 10
visits per ﬁeld in the r, i and z-bands, for a 10σ limiting magnitude
of about ∼24.1 in the i-band.

In this paper we use the largest contiguous region of Science
Veriﬁcation (SV) data which covers 139 square degrees with simi-
lar depth and ﬁlter coverage as the main DES survey. The SV data
were taken during the period of November 2012 – February 2013
before the ofﬁcial start of the science survey. All data used in this
study is based on the DES SVA1 Gold catalog 1 and several exten-
sions to it. The main catalog is a product of the DES Data Manage-
ment (DESDM) pipeline version “SVA1”. The DESDM pipeline
(Ngeow et al. 2006; Sevilla et al. 2011; Mohr et al. 2012; Desai et
al. 2012; Gruendl et al. in prep) begins with initial image process-
ing on single-exposure images and astrometry measurements from
the software package SCAMP (Bertin 2006). The single-exposure
images were then stacked to produce co-add images using the soft-
ware package SWARP (Bertin et al. 2002). Basic object detec-
tion, point-spread-function (PSF) modeling, star-galaxy classiﬁca-
tion and photometry were done on the individual images as well as
the co-add images using software packages SEXTRACTOR (Bertin
& Arnouts 1996) and PSFEX (Bertin 2011).

For weak lensing we use the coadd images only for object de-
tection, deblending, ﬂuxes (for use in photo-z measurements), and
for the detailed informational ﬂags which are important for deter-
mining a good set of galaxies to use for shear measurement. For
the purposes of estimating galaxy shears, we instead perform ob-
ject measurement on all available single-epoch images in which an
object was observed, using multi-epoch ﬁtting techniques (Jarvis et
al. 2015).

On smaller scales, the main contribution to the clustering is
correlations between dark matter and galaxies in the same halo; this
is described by the 1-halo term matter-galaxy cross power spectrum
as a sum of central and satellite terms:

(5)
where ˜uh is the Fourier transform of the halo density proﬁle of
mass Mh, and ˜us the Fourier transform of the spatial distribution of
satellite galaxies in the halo. We assume that the dark matter within
a halo is distributed according to an NFW proﬁle (Navarro et al.
1997), with a Bhattacharya et al. (2013) concentration-mass rela-
tion, c(M ) = 9 × (1.686/σ(M ))−0.29 × D(z)1.15, where σ(M )
is the square root of the variance in a ﬁlter with mass M and D(z)
is the growth factor at redshift z.

Following Hayashi & White (2008) and Zu et al. (2014), we
transition between these two regimes by only taking the larger con-
tribution of these two terms, such that

ξgm(r, z) =

ξ1h
gm(r, z)
gm(r, z) otherwise
ξ2h

for ξ1h

gm(r, z) (cid:62) ξ2h

gm(r, z)

(6)

(cid:40)

where ξ1h
gm(r, z) is the 1-halo galaxy-matter cross correlation func-
tion where the galaxy and dark matter are both in the same halo,
and ξ2h
gm(r, z) is the 2-halo galaxy-matter cross correlation func-
tion describing correlations between a galaxy and dark matter in a
different halo.

Finally, we can relate the galaxy-mass power spectrum to our
lensing observables. For a single lens at redshift z and source plane
at zs, we can write

Cgκ(l|z, zs) = χ

−2(z)Wκ(z, zs)Pgm(k = l/χ, z),

(7)

where χ(z) is the comoving distance to redshift z, the lensing win-
dow function Wκ(z, zs) is

Wκ(z, zs) =

¯ρm(z)

(1 + z)Σcrit(z, zs)

,

(8)

and the critical surface density Σcrit(z, zs) of a ﬂat universe is
given by

3.1 Lens sample: redMaGiC

The DES SV red-sequence Matched-ﬁlter Galaxy Catalog (red-
MaGiC, Rozo et al. 2015) is a catalog of photometrically selected
luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Speciﬁcally, redMaGiC uses the
redMaPPer-calibrated model for the color of red-sequence galax-
ies as a function of magnitude and redshift (Rykoff et al. 2014,
2016). This model is used to ﬁnd the best ﬁt photometric redshift
for all galaxies irrespective of type, and the χ2 goodness-of-ﬁt of
the model is computed. For each redshift slice, all galaxies fainter
than some minimum luminosity threshold Lmin are rejected. In
addition, redMaGiC applies a χ2 cut χ2 (cid:54) χ2
max, where the cut
max as a function of redshift is chosen to ensure that the result-
χ2
ing galaxy sample has a constant space density ¯n. In this work, we
use the sample with ¯n = 10−3h3Mpc−3; note that the redMaP-
Per algorithm assumes a ﬂat cosmology with Ωm = 0.3 in or-
der to calculate the comoving density and luminosity distances. We
expect the result from our analysis to be only marginally sensi-
tive to the cosmological parameters assumed. The luminosity cut
is L (cid:62) 0.5L∗(z), where the value of L∗(z) at z=0.1 is set to
match the redMaPPer deﬁnition for SDSS. The redshift evolution
for L∗(z) is that predicted using a simple passive evolution star-
burst model at z = 3. We utilize the redMaGiC sample because of
the excellent photometric redshifts of the redMaGiC galaxy cata-
log: the redMaGiC photometric redshifts are nearly unbiased, with
a median bias zspec − zphoto of 0.005, scatter σz/(1 + z) of 0.017,
and a 5σ redshift outlier rate of 1.4%. These photometric redshifts
are used to split the redMaGiC galaxies into different lens redshift
bins in this study. We refer the reader to Rozo et al. (2015) for fur-
ther details of this catalog.

We use three redshift bins of lens galaxies, 0.2 < z < 0.35,
0.35 < z < 0.5, and 0.5 < z < 0.8. To plot the redshift distribu-
tion N (z) of each bin in Fig. 1, we sum individual Gaussian red-
shift distributions for each lens, centered at the redMaGiC photo-z
estimate and with a width given by the redmagic photo-z error.
Note that using a Gaussian for each lens neglects any outlier com-
ponent: based on Rozo et al. (2015) (especially Figures 10 and 11)
the fraction of such outliers, and thus their effect on our modeling
of the lens redshift distribution, is small. The number of lenses per
redshift bin is ∼ 9000, 19000, and 67000 respectively.

3.2 Source sample

Based on the SVA1 data, two shear catalogs were produced and
tested extensively in Jarvis et al. (2015) – the ngmix 2 (Sheldon
2014) and the im3shape 3 (Zuntz et al. 2013) catalogs 1. The
main results in our paper are based on ngmix, but we also cross-
check with the im3shape catalog to demonstrate the robustness
of our results.

The im3shape implementation in this work estimates shapes
by jointly ﬁtting a parameterized galaxy model to all of the different
single-exposure r-band images, ﬁnding the maximum likelihood
solution. The PSFEX software is used to ﬁt pixelized models of
the PSF, and those models are then interpolated to the galaxy posi-
tions. Corrections to bias in the shear measurement associated with
noise (Refregier et al. 2012; Kacprzak et al. 2012) are applied. The
im3shape catalog has a raw number density of about 4.2 galaxies
per square arcminute.

ngmix uses sums of Gaussians to approximate common

the stacked N (z) from individual SkyNet p(z) distributions.

galaxy proﬁles: exponential disk, De Vaucouleurs’ proﬁle (de Vau-
couleurs 1948), and S´ersic proﬁle (S´ersic 1963). Any number of
Gaussians can be ﬁt, either completely free or constrained to be
co-centric and co-elliptical. For the DES SV galaxy images, we
used the exponential disk model. For the PSF ﬁtting, an Expectation
Maximization (Dempster et al. 1977) approach is used to model the
PSF as a sum of three free Gaussians. Shear estimation was carried
out using images in r, i, z bands, which enabled a larger raw galaxy
number density (6.9 galaxies per square arcminute).

Photometric redshifts for source galaxies in DES-SV were
studied in detail in Bonnett et al. (2015), using 4 different pho-
tometric redshift codes (ANNz2, BPZ, SkyNet and TPZ). The de-
tails and capabilities of these codes on early DES data were already
presented in S´anchez et al. (2014), where they showed the best per-
formance among a more extensive set of codes. For the results in
this paper we use the photometric redshifts by SkyNet (Graff et al.
2014; Bonnett 2015), which is a neural network algorithm that was
run on DES bands griz and produced a probability density func-
tion (PDF) for the redshift of each galaxy in the DES-SV shape
catalogs. In addition to the source PDFs, we make use of a SkyNet
point estimate of source photometric redshift given by the mean of
the PDF. Note that we only use SkyNet redshifts for the sources, as
the redMaGiC algorithm produces a separate photo-z estimate for
each lens.

Our source redshift distributions are shown in Fig. 1. Since
our galaxy-galaxy lensing tests will provide validation for the cos-
mology results of Kwan et al. (in prep), that work uses these same
redshift bins. These bins are also consistent with those used in the
DES SV results for cosmic shear (Becker et al. 2015; The Dark
Energy Survey Collaboration et al. 2015). Note however that the
∆Σ estimator, according to the deﬁnition in Eq. (18), uses every
background source behind each individual lens.

In Appendix B we make use of the “Buzzard v1.0c” version DES
mocks to validate measurement covariances. Three N-body simu-
lations, a 1050 Mpc/h box with 14003 particles, a 2600 Mpc/h box
with 20483 particles and a 4000 Mpc/h box with 20483 particles,
are combined along the line-of-sight to produce a full light cone
out to DES depths. These boxes were run with LGadget-2 (Springel
2005) and used 2LPTic initial conditions (Crocce et al. 2006) with
linear power spectra generated with CAMB (Lewis & Bridle 2002).
ROCKSTAR (Behroozi et al. 2013) was used to ﬁnd halos in the
N-body volumes. The ADDGALS algorithm (Busha et al. 2013)
is used to populate galaxies as a function of luminosity and color
into dark matter only N-body simulations. ADDGALS uses the re-
lationship between local dark matter density and galaxy luminosity,
determined by applying SHAM (Conroy et al. 2006; Reddick et al.
2013) on a high-resolution tuning simulation, to populate galax-
ies directly onto particles in the low-resolution simulations. Each
galaxy is then assigned a color by using the color-density rela-
tionship measured in the SDSS (Aihara et al. 2011) and evolved
to match higher redshift observations. For our mock lens sample,
the same redMaGiC selection (Rozo et al. 2015) was run on the
mock galaxies as on the data. For the mock shears, galaxies are as-
signed sizes and shape noise using Suprime-Cam observations pro-
cessed to match typical DES observing conditions (Szepietowski
et al. 2014). Finally, weak lensing shear for each source galaxy
was computed using the multiple-plane lensing code CALCLENS
(Becker 2013).

4 MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY

The most basic galaxy-galaxy lensing observable is the tangential
shear of background source galaxies relative to the line joining the
lens and source. For a given lens-source pair j this is given by

γt,j = −γ1,j cos(2φj) − γ2,j sin(2φj) ,

(14)

where γ1,j and γ2,j are the two components of shear measured
with respect to a Cartesian coordinate system centered on the lens,
and φj is the position angle of the source galaxy with respect to
the horizontal axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. However,
the intrinsic ellipticity of individual source galaxies is much larger
than the weak lensing shear, so it is necessary to average over many
such lens-source pairs. For our measurements and null tests, we will
compute the average in angular bins θ so that

TreeCorr4 (Jarvis et al. 2004) to compute all galaxy-galaxy lens-
ing measurements.

One advantage of this galaxy-shear cross-correlation over
shear-shear correlations is that additive shear systematics (with

constant γ1 or γ2) average to zero in the tangential coordinate sys-
tem. However, this cancellation takes place only when sources are
distributed isotropically around the lens, an assumption that is not
accurate near the survey edge or in heavily masked regions. To re-
move additive systematics robustly we also measure the tangential
shear around random points: such points have no net lensing sig-
nal, yet they sample the survey edge and masked regions in the
same way as the lenses. Our full estimator of tangential shear can
then be written

This measurement is directly comparable to the model prediction
in eq. (10).

We will also ﬁnd it useful to use another estimator that re-
moves the dependence of the lensing signal on the source redshift.
This will be especially helpful in carrying out null tests that involve
splitting the source galaxy sample into two or more samples, then
checking consistency between the measured lensing signal of each
(see Sections 5.3, 5.4, 5.5). This observable is estimated from the
measured shapes of background galaxies as

when measuring ∆Σ, although note that the results are not very
sensitive to this value: the difference is well under 1% when using
Ωm = 0.31 (as in Sec. 6.2). Just as with the raw tangential shear,
our ﬁnal estimator involves subtracting the contribution around ran-
dom points,

∆Σk(R) = ∆Σlens

(21)

We use 10 times as many random points as lenses so that noise from
the random point subtraction is negligible. We assign each random
point a redshift drawn from the distribution of lens redshifts. The
measurement in Eq. (21) is directly comparable to the model pre-
diction in Eq. (13). Note that in Eqs. (18-21) we use a point estimate
of photometric redshift for each source (see Sec. 3.2). However, we
checked that the method of integrating over the full distribution of
source redshifts (Sheldon et al. 2012; Nakajima et al. 2012; Man-
delbaum et al. 2013) gives consistent results for both our central
values and jackknife error bars.
We use a minimum ﬁt scale ∼ 0.5 arcminutes based on de-
blending constraints (see Appendix A1). The maximum scale we
use is 70 arcminutes, comparable to the size of our jackknife re-
gions. Using numerical simulations we have veriﬁed that the result-
ing jackknife covariance matrix estimate is accurate up to this scale
(see Appendix B for details), above which the jackknife overesti-
mates the errors from independent simulations. Therefore including

6

Clampitt et al.

larger scales in the ﬁts would still be conservative but there is very
marginal gain in S/N so we elect to stop at 70 arcminutes.

While our photometric redshifts remove or downweight
source galaxies near the lens redshift, some fraction of the sources
will still be physically correlated with the lenses (e.g., Sheldon et al.
2004; Mandelbaum et al. 2006). This effect, corrected by applying
“boost factors,” is most problematic near the center of massive ha-
los where correlations are strongest. Given our relatively high min-
imum ﬁt scale of 0.5 arcminutes and small halo mass (compared to
clusters, see Sec. 6.2) boost factor corrections are negligible for our
sample.

To estimate statistical errors, we divide the survey area into
N = 152 spatial jackknife regions based on HEALpix5 (G´orski et
al. 2005), each slightly smaller than 1 deg2. We perform the mea-
surement multiple times with each region omitted in turn. The co-
variance of the measurement (Norberg et al. 2009) is given by

factor causes a very small change to our best-ﬁt model and error
bars shown in Sec. 6.

5 DATA TESTS

We next perform a series of null tests used to check for and quantify
the size of systematic errors in our measurement due to biases in
the shear and photometric redshift catalogs. In order to quantify the
comparison of the data tests in this section with the null hypothesis
we compute the null χ2 for each of them in the following way:

is the correspond-
where yi corresponds to γi or ∆Σi, and C stat
ing covariance matrix. A list of the null χ2 value for each of the
tests can be found in Table 2. While χ2 is a helpful statistic, it is
possible that two tests, each with the same χ2 values, could indi-
cate different levels of statistical error. An extreme example is the
case where every data point is positive for one test, whereas half the
points are positive and half are negative (with the same amplitude)
for the second test. Thus for each test we also quote the result of
a single parameter, constant ﬁt to the data (including the full jack-
knife covariance). Since we perform many tests, some fraction of
them are expected to differ from zero simply by chance. For exam-
ple, even in the absence of systematics, 1 out of 3 tests will differ
from zero by more than 1σ, and 1 out of 25 will differ by more than
2σ. Our criteria for declaring a test as “passed” is that the constant

5 http://healpix.sf.net

(cid:88)

ﬁt should be within 2σ of zero, but note that using 1.5σ instead
does not change the status of any tests.

In this section we present tests that are unique to galaxy-
galaxy lensing. Other tests of the shear catalog, mostly focused on
validation of cosmic shear results, have been presented in Jarvis
et al. (2015) and Becker et al. (2015). For the tests that were al-
ready studied in prior DES SV work, we simply summarize the
implications for our galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements in Ap-
pendix A. These tests include deblending and sky subtraction (A1),
multiplicative shear bias (A2), and stellar contamination and shear
around stars (A3). For most tests in this section we show only the
result with ngmix, but the results for both shear pipelines are sum-
marized in Table 2.

5.1 Cross-component, PSF leakage, and random point shear

For the ﬁrst three tests (lensing cross-component, PSF leakage, and
shear around random points) we show only results using lenses be-
tween 0.35 < zL < 0.5 and sources 0.83 < zs < 1.3. This range
is emphasized because it is the ﬁducial lens bin of Kwan et al. (in
prep). Note however, these three tests also pass with the other lens
and source bin combinations.
In the cross-component test we measure the cross shear around
lens galaxies, which is a 45◦ rotated signal with respect to the tan-
gential shear deﬁned in Eq. (14). This signal should be compat-
ible with zero if the shear is only induced by gravitational lens-
ing, and therefore provides a test for systematic errors related
to PSF correction, which can leak into both tangential and cross
components of the galaxy shear. In Fig. 2 we show the result-
ing cross-shear measured around redMaGiC lenses. The reduced
χ2 = 8.3/13 (10.9/13) for ngmix (im3shape), and the test is
consistent with a constant ﬁt equal to zero.

Measuring source galaxy shapes requires modeling them con-
volved with the PSF pattern imprinted by the atmosphere and op-
tics. However, this process is imperfect, such that ∼ 1% (3%)
of the PSF shape may “leak” into the measured galaxy shape for

5.3 Source size splits

Shape measurements may be more biased for source galaxies which
are smaller and less well resolved. Although we have applied mul-
tiplicative bias corrections to our measurements (for im3shape)
or checked they are small (for ngmix) (see Jarvis et al. 2015), we
test to ensure that there is no residual bias by splitting the source
galaxies into two samples with different size. We use the “round”
measure of size (Jarvis et al. 2015) for ngmix, exp T r, split-
ting the two samples at 0.45 and measuring their difference rela-
tive to the central values of the combined sample. For im3shape,
the corresponding cut is at 1.4 using the Rgpp/Rp size parameter,
where Rgpp/Rp is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the
convolved model divided by the FWHM of the PSF for each expo-
sure. We use these values in order to make a 60% / 40% split of the
source galaxies, with slightly more sources in the smaller size bin.
This choice is made since smaller sources may be somewhat more
noisy, but the test results are not strongly dependent on the exact
cut.

The result for the lowest redshift lens bin, shown in Fig. 4, has
a reduced χ2 = 39.4/13 (7.6/13) for ngmix (im3shape). This
is a very high χ2 result for ngmix. As described at the beginning of
this Sec. 5, to quantify any possible systematic error we ﬁt a con-
stant to the fractional difference to determine its magnitude. The
result is a constant = 0.36 ± 0.08, thus the difference in the shear
of small and large source galaxies is signiﬁcant at about 4 − 5σ.
We assume that the true shear induced by lensing falls somewhere
between the answer given by small and large sources. The best-
case scenario is that the true shear falls exactly between the two, in
which case our full sample would have an unbiased average shear.
The worst case scenario is that either small or large sources give
biased estimates of the true shear while the other is unbiased. In
this case the bias of the full sample is half the constant ﬁt above,
0.36/2 = 18%. However, this scenario is at odds with other tests,
including the fact that ngmix and im3shape shears are in close
agreement. In Fig. 5 we show the measured ∆Σ ratio between the
two shear pipelines. The consistency is excellent for the two lower
lens redshift bins, with systematic differences of ∼ 1% for the two
lower lens redshift bins. Even for the highest lens bin, which re-
lies on the highest redshift sources, the difference is only 9%. The
good agreement between pipelines provides some evidence for the
smaller estimate of systematic errors. In Table 2 we note the total
systematic errors for ngmix, both with and without this size split.
When performing HOD ﬁts in Sec. 6.2 we do not include this 18%.

The picture is signiﬁcantly better for ngmix when using the
middle and highest lens redshift bins. These results are also shown
in Fig. 4 and indicate a conservative ∼ 2σ systematic of 7% (9%)
for the size split of middle (highest) lens redshift bin. These two
lens bins use nearly the same sources, but weighted differently ac-
cording to Eq. (19). We have not been able to identify the source
of the size split difference, but note here another possibility for in-
vestigation. A size-ﬁltered subsample might have a redshift distri-
bution that is different from what was estimated based on g, r, i,
and z magnitudes alone. For example, Gruen et al. (2014) found an
∼ 5–10% effect in the the mean DA(zL, zs)/DA(zs) from a size
split (between a large size subset and the full sample) selected in
B,R, and I ﬁlters. This means that given the same color and mag-
nitude – and therefore the same implied redshift – the difference
in the shear between the large sources and the full sample was ∼
5–10%. Similarly Applegate et al. (2014) found a 5% difference in
the lensing signal when using a large size subset. We do not have

points (purple circles) and tangential shear of foreground sources (red tri-
angles). Both tests pass easily (see detailed numbers in Table 2).

ngmix (im3shape), based on tests in Jarvis et al. (2015). Note
that while Jarvis et al. (2015) found leakage is consistent with zero
for both pipelines, the values we quote above conservatively as-
sume the maximum allowed leakage within the 1σ errors of Jarvis
et al. (2015). In order to quantify this systematic, we measure the
tangential shear of the PSF interpolated to the source galaxy lo-
cations, where again the tangential shear is measured around the
redMaGiC lenses. In Fig. 2 we show the result, multiplied by a
factor of 100. It is consistent with zero, and furthermore given the
small upper bounds on the leakage, even these small ﬂuctuations
about zero are much smaller than our measured lensing signal (see
Sec 6.1).

While our estimator of galaxy-galaxy lensing in Eq. (21) in-
volves subtracting the signal around random points that trace the
same survey geometry, it is nonetheless useful to conﬁrm that this
correction is small at all scales used in the analysis. This measure-
ment tests the importance of systematic shear which is especially
problematic at the survey boundary, and allows us to compare the
magnitude of the systematic shear with the magnitude of the signal
around actual lens galaxies. In Fig. 3 we show the result, which is
consistent with the null hypothesis. Again, see Table 2 for all the
detailed test results.

5.2 Flip lens and source samples

In reality, only source galaxies which are behind foreground lenses
will be lensed. However, in the presence of redshift errors some low
redshift sources will mistakenly be put behind the lenses, and vice-
versa. To get some handle on this effect, we repeat the measurement
of (cid:104)γt(cid:105) but using foreground sources (0.2 < zs < 0.5) stacked
around our highest redshift lenses (0.5 < zL < 0.8). Note that
this test is noisy and thus easily satisﬁed when applied to the lower
and medium redshift lens samples due to insufﬁcient numbers of
foreground sources. The result is shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2, and
is consistent with the null hypothesis.

and high signal-to-noise sources. These splits are not always consistent with zero, see the text in Sec. 5.3 for a detailed discussion.

5.4 Source S/N splits

While source galaxy S/N is partially correlated with size, it is a
distinct parameter that may separately inﬂuence the accuracy of ﬁt-
ted shapes. Thus, we ﬁnd the difference of two samples with S/N
< 45 and S/N > 45, where S/N is the ngmix “round” signal-to-
noise measure exp s2n r. For im3shape, source S/N is given
by snr in the im3shape catalog. (See Jarvis et al. 2015 for more
details on these measurements of galaxy S/N.) Again this split puts
60% of the sources into the smaller S/N bin. The result is shown
in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 2 for both pipelines. While the
size split in Sec. 5.3 failed for ngmix and passed for im3shape,
here the trend is reversed. The constant ﬁt to the difference is con-
sistent with zero for ngmix, but indicates a systematic error with
magnitude ∼ 10% for im3shape, using the lowest lens redshift
bin. The middle and high lens redshift bins pass this test for both
pipelines as summarized in Table 2.

Note that when repeating this test for the highest redshift lens
bin, we adjust the cut between low and high S/N samples to 35.
This is necessary because for both catalogs the source S/N distri-
bution is signiﬁcantly different for small and large S/N galaxies.
The adjusted cut ensures the number of galaxies in the small S/N
sample remains ∼ 60%.

5.5 Source redshift splits

For the following null test, we look for differences in the lensing
signal computed using two source samples split on redshift. For
continuity, these are the two higher redshift bins used by Becker et
al. (2015). The bins are 0.55 < z < 0.83, and 0.83 < z < 1.30
where z is the mean of the source SkyNet p(z). We compute the dif-

our 1σ errors.

worth studying in DES Year 1 data.

source bin, the nonlinear linear alignment model predicts at most
an ∼ 4% contamination of the tangential shear signal. The 4% re-
sults from using the ﬁducial IA amplitude (A = 1) from Bridle
& King (2007). (Note that The Dark Energy Survey Collabora-
tion et al. (2015) estimated an IA amplitude for this source sam-
ple of A = 2 ± 1, but the result was highly model dependent
with some scenarios consistent with 0.) Roughly half of the S/N
of the 0.35 < z < 0.5 lens bin comes from sources in the range
0.55 < z < 0.83; based on the N (z) in Fig. 1 the higher redshift
sources will not overlap in redshift with the lenses. Thus we esti-
mate a 2% intrinsic alignment contamination of our measurement
for this lens bin. This contamination is likely to be reduced fur-
ther when using the ∆Σ(R) statistic, which downweights sources
with redshift close to the lens. The lower lens bin 0.2 < z < 0.35
will have less contamination (see Fig. 1), so we conservatively use
2% for this bin as well. Repeating the above calculation for the
0.5 < z < 0.8 lens bin and 0.83 < z < 1.3 source bin, we ﬁnd
a 3% contamination. For each lens bin we add the estimated IA
contamination in quadrature to our other sources of error.

As an additional check, we compare the 2% estimate for the
0.35 < z < 0.5 lenses and 0.55 < z < 0.83 sources to the most
relevant current observational constraints of Blazek et al. (2012).
Using an SDSS DR7 LRG lens sample and photometric source
sample, Blazek et al. (2012) solve simultaneously for the intrinsic
alignment and lensing signals. They ﬁnd model-independent upper
limits (95% conﬁdence level) on the contamination of ∆Σ(R) of
∼ 6% for a projected separation 1h−1Mpc. This is further reduced
to ∼ 3% when assuming that blue source galaxies have zero in-
trinsic alignment amplitude. Thus, the 2% estimated using our spe-
ciﬁc lens and source redshift distributions is compatible with pre-
vious observational constraints. Although it is beyond the scope of
this work, the approach in Blazek et al. (2012) of constraining the
intrinsic alignment signal simultaneously with the lensing signal
should be pursued in future DES analyses with improved statistical
power.

5.7 Non-weak shear and magniﬁcation

The observable reduced shear will differ from γt according to

gt =

γt
1 − κ

.

(25)

Since κ is always rising with decreasing distance from the halo cen-
ter, the error from using γt rather than gt will be highest at our low-
est ﬁt radii, R ∼ 0.1 Mpc/h. Taking our largest best-ﬁt halo mass
∼ 2×1013M(cid:12)/h from Fig. 8, and assuming an NFW proﬁle for κ,
we ﬁnd that the fractional difference between the shear and reduced
shear (γt − gt)/gt is at most 3.5%. The difference falls to 2% by
our second data point at R (cid:46) 0.13. At a halo mass 3× 1013M(cid:12)/h,
roughly the upper edge of the most massive 1-sigma constraints in
Fig. 8, the difference at the lowest ﬁt radius is at most 5%. Since
the error in ignoring non-weak shear effects is much less than our
other sources of systematic and statistical error, we neglect it in
the analysis. Similar to non-weak shear, magniﬁcation is a poten-
tial systematic effect that is more important for lenses with larger κ
than our sample. See Mandelbaum et al. (2006) for a galaxy-galaxy
lensing speciﬁc discussion of the effects of magniﬁcation.

ference of ∆Σ(R) for both samples, for both the low and medium
redshift lens bins. The result is shown in Fig. 6, and for both ngmix
and im3shape shears the result is consistent with zero for both
lens samples. For ngmix the lowest redshift lens bin has a constant
ﬁt 5 ± 4%, which is outside 1σ. However as described at the be-
ginning of Sec. 5, one in three independent tests are expected to
fail at this level. As with previous sections, the χ2 and constant ﬁt
numbers are described in detail in Table 2.

5.6

Intrinsic alignments

We have so far assumed that a source galaxy’s observed tangen-
tial ellipticity is an unbiased estimate of its tangential shear. This
is valid if the source galaxy’s intrinsic ellipticity is not correlated
with the direction to the lens, which is reasonable if source and lens
galaxies are separated in redshift, i.e., not physically close. How-
ever since we have only imperfect, photometric redshift estimates,
there is some overlap in redshift between sources and lenses (see
Fig. 1).

The intrinsic shapes of galaxies are correlated with the cos-
mological density ﬁeld, an effect known as “intrinsic alignments”
(IA). Thus, for lens-source pairs which are physically close, source
galaxies may be preferentially aligned with the direction to the lens
galaxy. For example, in the commonly used linear alignment model
(Catelan et al. 2001; Hirata & Seljak 2004), the intrinsic ellipticity
is linearly related to the tidal ﬁeld (with a free amplitude), produc-
ing a correlation between intrinsic ellipticity and density that has
the same scale dependence as the shear on linear scales. On large
(2-halo) scales, the linear alignment model is expected to describe

Table 2. Summary of all test results described in § 5. We show reduced χ2 and constant ﬁt results for all data tests presented in this paper. For the tests based
on splitting the sample into two halves, the number in the table is an upper bound on the systematic error in ∆Σ (see the discussion in § 5.3). For brevity,
the ﬁrst three lines only show results for one lens bin, but the other bins are also consistent with zero. The last three rows show the net systematic error for
each lens bin, obtained by adding in quadrature the systematic errors from individual tests. In each case, the total error is shown both without and with (in
parentheses) the inclusion of the results of the source size and S/N split.

errors in our measurements. The ﬁnal lines of Table 2 show the
net systematic error for each lens redshift bin, obtained by adding
the individual sources of systematic error in quadrature. The sys-
tematic difference between large and small sources, photo-z bias,
shear calibration, and stellar contamination all cause multiplicative
biases on ∆Σ. Thus we estimate the systematic covariance matrix
ij = f 2 × ∆Σi∆Σj, where f is the total
for each lens bin as C syst
systematic error for that lens bin in Table 2 (e.g., 4% for the ngmix
shears and middle-z redMaGiC sample), and ∆Σ(Ri) is abbrevi-
ated ∆Σi. In Table 2 we show results both with and without the
size and S/N splits, as discussed in Sec. 5.3. Our total covariance
ij + C syst
matrix used in the HOD ﬁts (Sec. 6.2) is then Cij = C stat
,
where we drop the size and S/N splits. This approach is similar
to that followed for galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements by, e.g.,
Mandelbaum et al. (2006). That work folded together shear cali-
bration, photo-z bias, and stellar contamination into a systematic
error which was added in quadrature to the statistical errors when
performing ﬁts to the halo mass.

6 RESULTS

Having carried out a number of successful null tests and quanti-
ﬁed the remaining systematic errors, in this section we present the
galaxy-galaxy lensing signal and the best-ﬁt mean halo mass.

6.1 Measurement

In Fig. 7 we show the measured signal and statistical errors for lens
galaxies in three redshift bins. The ∆Σ estimator uses the weight-

−2
ing in Eq. (21), where the factor of Σ
crit signiﬁcantly downweights
sources that are very close to the lens. The three lens redshift sam-
ples are all consistent: taking the difference between any of the two
samples and ﬁnding the χ2 with a null model (constant and zero)
we ﬁnd reduced χ2 = 16.9/13, 19.7/13, and 20.1/13. The lat-
ter two (both of which involve the middle redshift bin) are slightly
high, but ﬁtting a single parameter constant model to the difference
between any pair of bins, we ﬁnd consistent results. The fractional
difference between the pairs of bins is 0.12±0.2, −0.06±0.21, and
0.17 ± 0.13: the result is within 1σ of zero for two cases and just
outside 1σ for the ﬁnal case. We conclude that our measurements
are consistent with no evolution of the red sample, although they
still leave open the possibility that future, higher signal-to-noise
data will measure a difference.

Having checked that the measurements from every redshift bin
are consistent, we also measure ∆Σ using the full redshift range,
0.2 < zL < 0.8. We calculate the signal-to-noise of the measure-

ment of the full sample as S/N =(cid:112)χ2 − Nbin = 29, where the χ2

is calculated using the jackknife covariance and a null model equal
to zero. We subtract the expectation value of the null hypothesis χ2
distribution, Nbin, to make this an unbiased estimator of S/N.

We also show γt measurements in Fig. 7 with the same lens
samples, calculated according to Eq. (17). For the lower and mid-
dle (upper) lens redshift bins, we use source redshifts 0.55 < zs <
1.30 (0.83 < zs < 1.30). The gap between lens and source red-
shifts is helpful in minimizing the inclusion of source galaxies that
are actually in front of the lens, and therefore not lensed. For γt re-
sults with source tomography, and the implications for cosmology,
see Kwan et al. (in prep).

(Zuntz et al. 2015) to perform all ﬁts.

Our best ﬁt models are shown in Fig. 7 for each of the three
lens bins. The model goodness-of-ﬁt is excellent in each case, with
reduced χ2 = 7.7/7, 10.6/7, and 8.1/7, in order of increasing red-
shift. In Fig. 8 we show constraints on the mean halo mass derived

number of central and satellite galaxies. The mean mass ranges
from ∼ 1013.35−1013.12M(cid:12)/h and shows little evolution between
redshift bins. Although the z = 0.5 − 0.8 bin has a lower best-ﬁt
central value, much of the difference is due to pseudo-evolution
(Diemer et al. 2013), the change in mass between halos at different
redshifts due to deﬁning mass relative to the mean matter density
at that redshift. Based on the results of Diemer et al. (2013), this
effect accounts for a drop in halo mass of ∆ log10 Mmean ∼ 0.1
between z = 0.3 and 0.7. This is roughly the size of our error bars,
reducing the difference between bins to about 1σ. Note also that
the errors in Fig. 8 are correlated; our quantitative test for consis-
tency of ∆Σ between different redshift bins (see Sec. 6.1) takes
into account these correlations.

Our results on σ and α were strongly informed by our choice
of priors. Mmin is constrained by our lensing data, but its central
value is sensitive to the choice of priors in σ and α. However, our
key result for the mean mass of redMaGiC halos is not sensitive to
the choice of priors: at the level of our measurement errors, weak
lensing is able to constrain the mass regardless of the uncertainty
in the full HOD.

6.2 Mean mass constraints

In this section, we use the measurements of ∆Σ(R) to explore the
dark matter environment of redMaGiC galaxies. We ﬁt the HOD
model described in Section 2 with six free parameters, Mmin, M1,
σ, α, fcen, and σ8. We only consider scales between 0.09 < R <
15 Mpc/h, due to deblending (Appendix A1) and covariance (Ap-
pendix B) constraints. We vary σ8 along with HOD parameters be-
cause the mass is somewhat sensitive to σ8 at large scales: σ8 and
bias are degenerate, the 2-halo term is proportional to bias, and bias
is a monotonic function of mass in our model. Our model ﬁts are
less sensitive to the other cosmology parameters, which we ﬁx to
Ωm = 0.31, h = 0.67, Ωb = 0.048, ns = 0.96, and w = −1,
all of which are consistent with the results of Kwan et al. (in prep).
Note that the results for redMaGiC galaxy bias are given in Kwan et
al. (in prep), which uses large scale clustering in order to break the

7 CONCLUSIONS

The main goal of this work was to validate galaxy-galaxy lensing
measurements made with DES science veriﬁcation data. To that end
we have performed a number of null tests on the shear catalogs and
photometric redshifts and have quantiﬁed resulting systematic er-
rors. We performed these null tests and all measurements with two
independent shear pipelines, ngmix and im3shape, and found
good consistency between the two methods. The null tests and the-
ory uncertainties are described in Sec. 5. One unresolved issue is
the size split test with the ngmix catalog, which showed signiﬁcant
differences in ∆Σ measured from large and small source galaxies.
We discuss in Sec. 5.3 the results of this test and why it is difﬁcult
to interpret, and leave its resolution for future work. We validated
our jackknife statistical errors using a suite of 50 mock surveys.
Such detailed tests are a necessary foundation for other work rely-
ing on tangential shear measurements with these data, for example,
the cosmology results of Kwan et al. (in prep) and Baxter et al.
(2016), bias results of Prat et al. (in prep), and trough (Gruen et al.
2015) and void lensing results (S´anchez et al. in prep).

We measured the lensing signal of redMaGiC galaxies, a
sample selected speciﬁcally to minimize photometric redshift er-
ror and outlier rate. The total signal-to-noise of 29 allowed us to
ﬁt a simple HOD model and constrain the lens sample’s central
halo mass. Dividing the lenses into 3 redshift bins over the range
0.2 < z < 0.8, we found no evidence for evolution in the mean
halo mass ∼ 2 × 1013M(cid:12)/h of our sample, at the level of current
errors.

As the analysis begun here continues with DES Year 1 data
and eventually the full 5 years of the survey, the statistical errors
will continue to improve. For example, assuming the full survey
reaches the goal of 5000 square degrees with the same depth as
the SV data, the volume probed by our lens sample will increase
√
by a factor of 36. Shape noise, our dominant small scale error, de-
pends on the number of lenses as 1/
Nlens, for ﬁxed source den-
sity. Shape noise will thus be a factor of 6 smaller. With this greater
volume of data, new challenges will surface in ensuring the mea-
surement is still statistics dominated. This will require further work
in understanding and modeling systematic errors, but as those chal-
lenges are addressed our HOD constraints will improve quickly.
Another improvement for future work will involve adding infor-
mation from galaxy clustering, as done by Park et al. (2015) in
simulations.

APPENDIX A: SYSTEMATICS TESTS

Here we describe various systematic tests that were studied in other
work, but are also relevant for our results. These include deblend-
ing and sky subtraction, multiplicative shear bias, stellar contam-
ination, and shear around stars. The impact of these tests on our
systematic error budget is summarized in Table 2.

A1 Deblending and sky subtraction

Both shape measurement methods considered here ﬁt parametric
models across square “postage-stamps” of pixels centered on the
galaxy being measured. These postage-stamps may contain light
from neighboring objects that could bias the shape measurement.
The direction of the bias is likely to be related to the direction of
the neighbour with respect to the galaxy being measured - hence
if the contaminating light is from the lens, or from objects spa-
tially correlated with the lens, a small scale contamination to the
tangential shear signal could arise. Any such effect is likely to be
mitigated by the masking of neighbouring objects during ﬁtting,
and removing blended objects from the catalogs, as described in
Jarvis et al. (2015) (Sections 5.2 and 8.1 respectively). Figure 20 of
Jarvis et al. (2015) shows the tangential shear around bright stars
as a function of angular separation, and this shows no evidence for
a systematic signal around bright objects at small scales. Nonethe-
less we choose a conservative lower angular scale of 30 arcsec for
the results in Sec. 6.

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

A2 Multiplicative shear biases

Jarvis et al. (2015) studied in detail residual multiplicative biases
for these shear catalogs. They found that multiplicative bias should
be less than 3% in order to satisfy requirements for cosmic shear.
In Figure 24 of that work, they show that residual multiplicative
biases are at most 1% for im3shape and 2% for ngmix. The
one exception is the lowest redshift bin for ngmix, which has a
residual bias ∼ 4%. However, since most of our signal comes from
the higher redshift bins, we assume residual multiplicative bias is
2%, and add this in quadrature with the other sources of error.

A3 Stellar contamination and shear around stars

Since stars will not be gravitationally lensed by our lens galaxies,
contamination of the source sample by stars will dilute our signal
by the fraction of stars in the sample. The DES SV galaxy cluster-
ing sample in Crocce et al. (2015) had at most 2% stellar contami-
nation. While the sample selection for clustering differs somewhat
from that for the weak lensing shear catalogs (Jarvis et al. 2015),
the differences should not increase stellar contamination. Thus we
take 2% as our estimated systematic error from stellar contamina-
tion.

Similarly, stars do not act as gravitational lenses of distant
source galaxies. The measurement of tangential shear around faint
stars provides a null test that can diagnose problems with PSF inter-
polation and PSF modelling (Jarvis et al. 2015). This measurement
was shown for DES SV data in Figure 20 of Jarvis et al. (2015),
and was consistent with the null hypothesis.

APPENDIX B: VALIDATION OF STATISTICAL ERRORS

In order to test the jackknife error bars obtained from the data, we
compare to covariances from simulations. The same redMaGiC al-
gorithm has been run on mock galaxies in 50 nearly independent
realizations of a 150 deg2 survey constructed by dividing a wide
area simulation into 50 pieces (see Sec. 3.3). First, we compare the
covariance from these independent realizations to errors obtained
by dividing each 150 deg2 simulation into 144 jackknife regions.
This comparison is made using the ﬁducial lens and source bins
from Kwan et al. (in prep): lenses between 0.35 < zL < 0.5 and
sources 0.83 < zs < 1.30. The results are shown in Fig. B1. The
agreement is very good, at least out to ∼ 15 arcminutes, where
the jacknife method begins to systematically overestimate the true
error. Although this simulated area is slightly larger than our ﬁnal
area in the data and the number of realizations is smaller, the main
point of this exercise is to validate the jackknife method. Similarly,
in Fig. B2 we compare the normalized covariances obtained with
both methods. The jackknife covariance is less noisy since it is an
average of the jackknife method applied to 10 simulations, but the
qualitative features are very similar. Both methods have signiﬁcant
correlations just off the diagonal, starting around ∼ 10 arcminutes.
At θ ∼ 70 arcmin, our largest scale used in tests and ﬁts, the jack-
knife method may overestimate the true error by a factor up to 2.

covariance from independent simulations (purple band) and the jackknife
method applied to the same simulations (red points). The agreement be-
tween the true covariance and jackknife out to θ ∼ 15 arcmin validates the
jackknife approach on these scales. At θ ∼ 70 arcmin, our largest scale
used in tests and ﬁts, the jackknife method may overestimate the true error
by a factor up to 2. In this sense our HOD constraints using jackknife on the
data are conservative.
