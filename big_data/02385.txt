Abstract. We construct explicit geodesics on the collection of isometry classes of com-
pact metric spaces endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ metric, complementing a result in
[INT15].

1. Introduction and Definitions

The collection of compact metric spaces, denoted M throughout this paper, is a valid
pseudometric space when endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ distance [Gro99, BBI01]. We
will denote this space by pM, dGHq. Furthermore, the space pM{ „, dGHq, where we deﬁne

pX, dXq „ pY, dY q ðñ pX, dXq is isometric to pY, dY q, and

dGHprXs, rY sq :“ dGHpX, Y q,

It is known that pM{ „, dGHq is separable, complete [Pet06],
is a metric space [BBI01].
and geodesic [INT15]. The goal of this short note is to provide an explicit construction of
geodesics on pM{ „, dGHq. Our result is inspired by a similar result proved by Sturm for the
space of metric measure spaces [Stu12].

Before proceeding, we should clarify the meaning of the term geodesic space, as used above.
We ﬁrst deﬁne some related terms. A curve in a metric space pX, dXq is a continuous map
γ : r0, 1s Ñ X, and its length is given by:

Lpγq :“ sup#n´1
ÿi“1

dXpγptiq, γpti`1q : 0 “ t1 ď t2 ď . . . ď tn “ 1, n P N+ .

Such a curve is called a geodesic if for any s, t P r0, 1s,

dXpγpsq, γptqq “ |t ´ s| ¨ dXpγp0q, γp1qq.

As a consequence of this deﬁnition, for any geodesic γ such that γp0q “ x and γp1q “ x1, one
has Lpγq “ dXpx, x1q. The metric space pX, dXq is called a geodesic space if for any x, x1 P X,
there exists a geodesic γ connecting x and x1.

We now proceed to the deﬁnition of the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ distance. Given pX, dXq, pY, dY q P

M, we say that a relation R Ď X ˆ Y is a correspondence if for any x P X, there exists
y P Y such that px, yq P R, and for any y P Y , there exists x P X such that px, yq P R. The

set of all such correspondences will be denoted RpX, Y q. The distortion of any non-empty
relation R Ă X ˆ Y is deﬁned to be:

The Gromov-Hausdorﬀ distance dGH : M ˆ M Ñ R` is then deﬁned as follows:

dispRq.

There are other equivalent formulations of dGH that we do not use in this paper; see [BBI01,
Chapter 7] for more details.

To check that dGH is also well-deﬁned on rXs, rY s P M{ „, let X 1 P rXs, Y 1 P rY s. Then:

dGHprX 1s, rY 1sq “ dGHpX 1, Y 1q “ dGHpX, Y q “ dGHprXs, rY sq,

where the second-to-last equality follows from the triangle inequality and the observation
that dGHpX, X 1q “ dGHpY, Y 1q “ 0.

Theorem 1 (Completeness). The metric space pM{ „, dGHq is complete [Pet06].

Details about the topology generated by the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ distance can be found
in [BBI01]. One important fact is that it allows the existence of many compact sets in
pM{ „, dGHq, in the sense described below.

Deﬁnition. For a compact metric space X, the ε-covering number covXpεq is deﬁned to be
the minimum number of ε-balls required to cover X. Note that isometric spaces have equal
covering number.

Theorem 2 (Gromov’s precompactness theorem). Given a bounded function N : p0, 8q Ñ N
and D ą 0, let CpN, Dq Ď pM{ „, dGHq be the collection of all rXs such that diampXq ă D
and covXpεq ď Npεq for each ε ą 0. Then CpN, Dq is precompact [Pet06].

2. Geodesic structure on pM{ „, dGHq

This section contains our proof showing that pM{ „, dGHq is a geodesic space. This fact
was established in [INT15] via an application of Gromov’s precompactness theorem. In this
paper we present a direct proof of this fact based on ideas used by Sturm in the setting
of metric measure spaces [Stu12]. In particular, we complement [INT15] by providing an
explicit construction of geodesics.

As a ﬁrst step, we prove the useful fact that for any two compact metric spaces X and Y ,

an optimal correspondence R such that dGHpX, Y q “ 2 dispRq can always be found.
Let X and Y be compact metric spaces. Endow X ˆ Y with the product metric

δ`px, yq, px1, y1q˘ :“ max`dXpx, x1q, dY py, y1q˘, for all px, yq, px1, y1q P X ˆ Y .

Note that X ˆ Y is compact. Next consider the set of all non-empty closed subsets of X ˆ Y ,
denoted CpX ˆ Y q, endowed with the Hausdorﬀ distance δH arising from δ. It follows from
Blaschke’s theorem [BBI01] that CpX ˆ Y q is also compact.

Lemma 3. Let X ˆ Y be the compact metric space with product metric δ as deﬁned above.
Let R, S Ă X ˆ Y be any two non-empty relations. Then,

(1) dX
(2) dY

Hpπ2pRq, π2pSqq ď δHpR, Sq.

(3) | dispRq ´ dispSq| ď 4 δHpR, Sq.

Here π1 and π2 are the natural projections of X ˆ Y onto X and Y , respectively.

Proof. To show (1), let η ą δHpR, Sq. Let x P π1pRq, and let y P Y be such that px, yq P R.
Then there exists px1, y1q P S such that δ ppx, yq, px1, y1qq ă η. Thus dXpx, x1q ă η, where x1 P
π1pSq. Similarly, given any u P π1pSq, we can ﬁnd u1 P π1pRq such that dXpu, u1q ă η. Thus
dX
H pπ1pRq, π1pSqq ă η. Since η ą δHpR, Sq was arbitrary, it follows that dX
H pπ1pRq, π1pSqq ď
δHpR, Sq.

The proof for inequality (2) is similar, so we omit it.
To prove inequality (3), let η ą δHpR, Sq, and let ε P pδHpR, Sq, ηq. Deﬁne

Note that, since δH pR, Sq ă ε, L is a correspondence between R and S. Then,

But η ą δHpR, Sq was arbitrary. It follows that | dispRq ´ dispSq| ď 4 δHpR, Sq.

(cid:3)

Proposition 4. Let X, Y P M. Then there exists a correspondence R P CpX ˆ Y q such that
dispRq “ 2 dGHpX, Y q. Thus we can always write:

dGHpX, Y q “ 1

2 min

RPRpX,Y q

dispRq.

Proof. Let pεnqn Ó 0 be an arbitrary sequence in R`. For each n, let Xn, Yn be εn-nets
for X and Y respectively.
It is a fact that if S is an ε-net in a metric space X, then
dGHpS, Xq ă ε ([BBI01, Example 7.3.11]). Thus dGHpXn, Xq Ñ 0 and dGHpYn, Y q Ñ 0 as
n Ñ 8. Optimal correspondences always exist between ﬁnite metric spaces, so for each
n P N, let Rn P RpXn, Ynq be such that dispRnq “ 2 dGHpXn, Ynq. Since pRnqn is a sequence
in the compact metric space CpX ˆ Y q, it contains a convergent subsequence. To avoid
double subscripts, we reindex if necessary and let pRnqn denote this convergent subsequence.
δHpRn, Rq “ 0. Then by Lemma 3,
Let R P CpX ˆ Y q denote the δH-limit of pRnqn, i.e.

lim
nÑ8

| dispRnq ´ dispRq| ď 4δHpRn, Rq Ñ 0 as n Ñ 8.

4

CONSTRUCTING GEODESICS ON THE SPACE OF COMPACT METRIC SPACES

So dispRnq Ñ dispRq. But also,

dispRnq “ 2 dGHpXn, Ynq Ñ 2 dGHpX, Y q as n Ñ 8,

since |dGHpX, Y q ´ dGHpXn, Ynq| ď dGHpXn, Xq ` dGHpYn, Y q Ñ 0. Then we have:

It remains to show that R is a correspondence. Note that for any n,

dispRq “ 2 dGHpX, Y q.

dX
H pX, π1pRqq ď dX
ď dX

H pX, π1pRnqq ` dX
H pX, Xnq ` δHpRn, Rq

H pπ1pRnq, π1pRqq

(By Lemma 3).

But the term on the right can be made arbitrarily small, since each Xn is an εn-net for X
and limnÑ8 δHpRn, Rq “ 0. Thus dX
H pX, π1pRqq “ 0, and therefore X “ π1pRq. Since R is a
closed subset of the compact space X ˆ Y , it is compact, and its continuous image π1pRq is
also compact, hence closed (since X is Hausdorﬀ). Thus π1pRq “ π1pRq “ X. Similarly, it
can be shown that π2pRq “ Y . Thus R is a correspondence. This concludes the proof. (cid:3)

Theorem 5. pM{ „, dGHq is a geodesic space. More speciﬁcally, let rXs, rY s P pM{ „, dGHq.
Then there exists a geodesic between rXs and rY s.

Proof of Theorem 5. Suppose we can ﬁnd a curve γ : r0, 1s Ñ M such that γp0q “ X and
γp1q “ Y , and for all s, t P r0, 1s,

dGHpγpsq, γptqq “ |t ´ s| ¨ dGHpX, Y q.

Then we also have dGHprγpsqs, rγptqsq “ |t ´ s| ¨ dGHprXs, rY sq for all s, t P r0, 1s, and we will
be done. So we will show the existence of such a curve γ.

Let R be a correspondence between X and Y such that dispRq “ 2 dGHpX, Y q. Such a

correspondence always exists, by Proposition 4.

For each t P p0, 1q consider the space `γptq, dγptq˘ where γptq “ R and
dγptq`px, yq, px1, y1q˘ “ p1 ´ tq ¨ dXpx, x1q ` t ¨ dY py, y1q

for all px, yq, px1, y1q P R. Note that it can be checked that dγptq is a legitimate metric on R.
We also set γp0q “ X, γp1q “ Y , and deﬁne dγp0q “ dX, dγp1q “ dY .

Claim 1. For any s, t P r0, 1s,

dGHpγpsq, γptqq ď |t ´ s| ¨ dGHpX, Y q.

Suppose for now that Claim 1 holds. We further claim that this implies, for all s, t P r0, 1s,

dGHpγpsq, γptqq “ |t ´ s| ¨ dGHpX, Y q.

To see this, assume towards a contradiction that there exist s0 ă t0 such that :

dGHpγps0q, γpt0qq ă |t0 ´ s0| ¨ dGHpX, Y q.
Then dGHpX, Y q ď dGHpX, γps0qq ` dGHpγps0q, γpt0qq ` dGHpγpt0q, Y q

ă |s0 ´ 0| ¨ dGHpX, Y q ` |t0 ´ s0|dGHpX, Y q ` |1 ´ t0|dGHpX, Y q
“ dGHpX, Y q, a contradiction.

Thus it suﬃces to show Claim 1. There are three cases: (i) s, t P p0, 1q, (ii) s “ 0, t P p0, 1q,

and (iii) s P p0, 1q, t “ 1. The latter two cases are similar, so we just prove (i) and (ii).

For (i), ﬁx s, t P p0, 1q. Notice that ∆ :“ diagpR ˆ Rq “ tpr, rq : r P Ru is a correspondence

in RpR, Rq “ Rpγptq, γpsqq. Then we obtain:

2 disp∆q “ |t ´ s| ¨ dGHpX, Y q. This proves case (i) of Claim 1.

For (ii), ﬁx s “ 0, t P p0, 1q. Deﬁne RX “ tpx, px, yqq : px, yq P Ru. Then RX is a corre-

spondence in RpX, γptqq.

|1 ´ s| ¨ dGHpX, Y q, is similar. Thus Claim 1 follows. This concludes our proof.

for any X, Y P M, let RoptpX, Y q denote the set of corre-
