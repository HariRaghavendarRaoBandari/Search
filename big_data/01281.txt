ABSTRACT

An accretion outburst onto a neutron star deposits hydrogen-rich and/or helium-rich material into
the neutron star’s envelope. Thermonuclear burning of accreted material robustly produces Urca pairs
— pairs of nuclei that undergo cycles of e−-capture and β−-decay. The strong T 5 dependence of the
Urca cooling neutrino luminosity means that Urca pairs in the neutron star interior potentially remove
heat from accretion-driven nuclear reactions. In this study, we identify Urca pairs in the neutron star’s
ocean — a plasma of ions and electrons overlaying the neutron star crust — and demonstrate that
Urca cooling occurs at all depths in the ocean. We ﬁnd that Urca pairs in the ocean and crust lower
the ocean’s steady state temperature during an accretion outburst and unstable carbon ignition, which
is thought to trigger superbursts, occurs deeper than it would otherwise. Cooling superburst light
curves, however, are only marginally impacted by cooling from Urca pairs because the superburst
peak luminosity Lpeak is always much greater than the Urca pair neutrino luminosity Lν in the hot
post-superburst ocean.

1. INTRODUCTION

In a low-mass X-ray binary, an accretion outburst de-
posits hydrogen-rich and/or helium-rich material into the
envelope of the neutron star primary. Nuclear burn-
ing of accreted material produces seed nuclei for the
rapid proton-capture (rp) process and the αp-process
(Wallace & Woosley 1981). The rp- and αp-process
produce proton-rich nuclei with mass numbers between
A ∼ 60–100 during unstable burning in type-I X-ray
bursts (Schatz et al. 1998; Woosley et al. 2004; Cyburt
et al. 2010) and superbursts (Schatz et al. 2003; Keek &
Heger 2011; Keek et al. 2012). Ashes of nuclear burn-
ing are compressed deeper into the neutron star ocean
during subsequent accretion outbursts.

Further accretion compresses envelope material into
the neutron star’s crust where non-equilibrium nuclear
reactions deposit ≈ 1–2 MeV per accreted nucleon of heat
(Haensel & Zdunik 1990; Gupta et al. 2007; Haensel &
Zdunik 2008). Crustal heating provides a heat ﬂux into
the overlying neutron star ocean, where the unstable ig-
nition of 12C+12C fusion triggers superbursts (Woosley
& Taam 1976; Taam & Picklum 1978; Brown & Bildsten
1998; Cumming & Bildsten 2001; Strohmayer & Brown
2002). Current superburst ignition models, however, re-
quire a larger heat ﬂux than supplied by crustal heating
to match observed superburst ignition depths (Cumming
& Bildsten 2001; Cumming et al.
2006). The source
of extra heating is unknown, although some additional
heat may be supplied by compositionally-driven convec-
tion (Medin & Cumming 2011, 2014, 2015) and stable
helium burning (Brown & Bildsten 1998) in the neutron
star envelope.

(cid:63)deibelal@msu.edu

Nuclear burning ashes also contain pairs of nuclei that
undergo e−-capture/β−-decay cycles, known as Urca
pairs, that cool the neutron star crust by neutrino emis-
sion (Bahcall & Wolf 1965; Schatz et al. 2014). Neu-
trino emission from an Urca cycle scales as T 5 and poten-
tially liberates a substantial amount of energy from the
neutron star’s interior relative to the heat deposited by
non-equilibrium reactions. Schatz et al.
(2014) showed
that for a large enough abundance of Urca pairs in the
crust, Urca cooling could balance crustal heating when
crust temperatures are T (cid:38) 2 × 108 K. As a result, Urca
cooling in the crust of hot neutron star transients, for ex-
ample MAXI J0556-332 (Matsumura et al. 2011; Homan
et al.
2014), impacts quiescent light curve predictions
from crust thermal relaxation models (Deibel et al.
2015).

Here we examine Urca pairs in the neutron star’s
ocean that potentially remove heat from the ocean near
the depth of superburst ignition. Observed superbursts
to date occur on accreting neutron stars with accre-
tion rates between ˙M ≈ 0.1–0.3 ˙MEdd (Wijnands 2001)
and superburst ignition depths are constrained between
yign ≈ 0.5–3× 1012 g cm−2 in these sources (Cumming et
al. 2006). We ﬁnd that Urca pairs in the superburst ig-
nition region are a factor of ∼ 100–1000 less luminous
than the pairs identiﬁed in the crust (Schatz et al.
2014). As a result, the neutrino luminosity from ocean
Urca pairs is always much less than the peak superburst
luminosity (Lν < Lpeak), and ocean pairs have a mini-
mal impact on cooling superburst light curve predictions.
Neutrino cooling from crust Urca pairs, however, is suf-
ﬁciently strong to limit the ocean’s steady state temper-
ature to T (cid:46) 9 × 108 K and carbon ignition must occur
at depths yign (cid:38) 1011 g cm−2.

Deibel et al.

In Section 2, we calculate the neutrino luminosities
from 85 Urca cycling pairs in the neutron star ocean
and give a general formula for the neutrino luminosity
associated with an Urca pair.
In Section 3 we explore
the impact of ocean and crust Urca pair neutrino cooling
on carbon ignition depths, and constraints on shallow
heating provided by the shallow superburst ignition in
4U 1636-536. Superburst cooling light curves with Urca
pairs in the ocean are calculated in Section 4. We discuss
our ﬁndings in Section 5.

2. OCEAN URCA PAIRS

When nuclear burning ashes are compressed into the
neutron star ocean to mass densities ρ (cid:38) 106 g cm−3, nu-
clei undergo non-equilibrium e−-captures in the ambient
degenerate electron gas (Bisnovaty˘i-Kogan & Chechetkin
1979; Sato 1979). At ﬁnite temperature, e−-captures
begin when µe (cid:38) |QEC| − kBT , where QEC is the e−-
capture threshold energy and µe is the chemical poten-
tial of the electron gas. If the e−-capture daughter un-
dergoes β−-decay before any other nuclear reactions, the
e−-capture parent and daughter form an e−-capture/β−-
decay Urca cycle (Gamow & Schoenberg
1941), and
these nuclei form an Urca pair. Over an Urca cycle,
a signiﬁcant amount of energy is emitted as neutrinos,
which eﬀectively cools the neutron star interior (Gamow
& Schoenberg 1941).

Although the most abundant nuclear burning ashes in
thermonuclear bursts are even-A nuclei (e.g., Schatz et
al. 1998), these nuclei do not typically form Urca pairs.
For even-A nuclei, with proton number Z and neutron
number N , e−-captures typically proceed in two steps:
i) the even-Z even-N parent nucleus e−-captures into
a low-lying state of the odd-Z odd-N ﬁrst e−-capture
daughter ii) the odd-Z odd-N ﬁrst e−-capture daugh-
ter immediately e−-captures into a low-lying state of the
even-Z even-N second e−-capture daughter due to odd-
even mass staggering. Insuﬃcient electron phase space
exists for the second e−-capture daughter to undergo β−-
decay and an e−-capture/β−-decay Urca cycle is there-
fore blocked. Under special circumstances even-A nuclei
may form an Urca cycle, however, this requires a spe-
ciﬁc set of excited state energies and spin-parities J π in
the ﬁrst and second e−-capture daughters (Meisel et al.
2015).

Nearly all odd-A nuclei, with odd-Z even-N or even-
Z odd-N , may form an Urca cycle. For odd-A nu-
clei, |QEC| increases monotonically for more neutron-rich
species. As a consequence, following an e−-capture onto
an odd-A nucleus, a second e−-capture is energetically
blocked. At ﬁnite temperature, electron phase space is
available for the e−-capture daughter to undergo β−-
decay, which occurs before any other nuclear reaction
(Tsuruta & Cameron 1970). As a result, the majority
of Urca cooling pairs identiﬁed to date are odd-A nuclei
(Schatz et al. 2014).

Here we focus on the complete identiﬁcation of weaker
Urca pairs in the A < 106 mass range — the highest
mass produced in the rp-process (Schatz et al.
2001)
— that are located at shallow depths (|QEC| (cid:46) 5 MeV.
These Urca cycles occur in the neutron star ocean, at
column depths inferred for superburst ignition yign =
P/g ≈ 0.5–3 × 1012 g cm−2 (Cumming et al.
2006).

We identify a total of 85 odd-A isotopes that form Urca
cycles in the neutron star’s ocean. In addition to ground-
state to ground-state transitions, we include e−-captures
onto excited states with excitation energies EX ∼ kBT ∼
100 keV for ocean temperatures near T ∼ 109 K reached
in superbursting neutron stars (Cumming & Macbeth
2004).
For each odd-A isotope, we calculate the total neu-
trino luminosity from e−-capture/β−-decay cycles using
analytic expressions for the reaction rates (Tsuruta &
Cameron 1970). The f t-values, which measure the tran-
sition strength of e−-captures and β−-decays, are based
on experimental data1 when available; otherwise, f t-
values are obtained from Table 1 of Singh et al. (1998),
using the experimentally determined ground-state spin-
parities J π of the e−-capture parent and daughter nuclei
(Tuli 2011).
Following the approach of Tsuruta & Cameron (1970),
in the relativistic limit (µe ≈ EF (cid:29) mec2) the spe-
ciﬁc neutrino emissivities from e−-captures (+) and β−-
decays (−) on nuclei in the degenerate electron ocean

3. URCA COOLING AND CARBON IGNITION
Urca pair neutrino cooling may impact the ignition
conditions for thermonuclear bursts. In particular, Urca
cooling lowers the ocean’s steady state temperature and
superbursts ignite deeper. In this section, we explore the
eﬀect of Urca cooling’s depth and strength on unstable
12C+12C ignition.

We calculate the neutron star ocean’s thermal evolu-
tion using the open source code dStar (Brown 2015)
which solves the general relativistic heat diﬀusion equa-
tion using the MESA numerical library (Paxton et al.
2011, 2013, 2015). During active accretion, crustal heat-
ing deposits ≈ 1.5 MeV per accreted nucleon in the in-
ner crust, which we place over the range y = 5 × 1015
to 2 × 1017 g cm−2. To reproduce observed ignition
depths, we add extra heating proportional to the ac-
cretion rate Qshallow to the outer crust between y =
1.7 × 1015 to 5.4 × 1015 g cm−2 and the ﬂux entering
the ocean Fb is taken at y = 1.7 × 1015 g cm−2. The
net heat ﬂux from crustal heating and extra heating en-
tering the ocean is Fb = Qb ˙m, where Qb follows the
relation Qb ≈ 0.25( ˙m/0.3 ˙mEdd)−1 (Cumming et al.
2006) for superburst ignition at y = 1012 g cm−2, where
˙mEdd = 8.8×104 g cm−2 s−1 is the local Eddington mass
accretion rate.

Runaway thermonuclear burning of carbon occurs
when the local heating rate from carbon fusion c and
the local cooling rate cool satisfy the condition dc/dT >
dcool/dT . For the local heating rate from carbon burn-
ing, we use the 12C+12C reaction rate given by Caughlan
& Fowler (1988) with screening by Ogata et al. (1993).
The local cooling rate from thermal diﬀusion is given by
cool = ρKT /y2 (Fujimoto et al.
1981). We calculate
unstable carbon ignition in an iron ocean with XFe = 0.8
and XC = 0.2.

We investigate the thermal evolution in a neutron star
with mass M = 1.4 M(cid:12), radius R = 10 km, and core
temperature Tcore = 3 × 107 K. The neutron star ac-
cretes at a local accretion rate ˙m = 0.3 ˙mEdd — the
minimum accretion rate to ignite carbon in an ocean
with XC = 0.2 (Cumming et al.
2006) — until the
ocean temperature reaches steady state. The model re-
quires Qshallow ≈ 5 MeV per accreted nucleon to pro-

≈ 1% (≈ 10%) for X · L34 = 10 (X · L34 = 100). Fur-
thermore, carbon ignition occurs deeper in the cooler
ocean. For example, an Urca pair located at y/yign,0 = 1
moves ignition to yign ≈ 1.3 yign,0 (yign ≈ 3 yign,0) for
X · L34 = 10 (X · L34 = 100). The results are similar
for the other Urca pair locations tested. When an Urca
pair is located at y/yign,0 = 0.1 the carbon ignition depth
increases to yign ≈ 1.2 yign,0 (yign ≈ 2 yign,0) for an Urca
pair with X · L34 = 10 (X · L34 = 100). When an Urca
pair is located at y/yign,0 = 10 the carbon ignition depth
increases to yign ≈ 1.4 yign,0 (yign ≈ 4 yign,0) for an Urca
pair with X · L34 = 10 (X · L34 = 100).
Ocean Urca pairs reduce the ocean’s steady state tem-
perature and require deeper carbon ignition only when
X · L34 (cid:38) 10. At the abundances expected for X-ray
2014),
burst and superburst burning (Schatz et al.
(cid:80)
however, all ocean Urca pairs have X · L34 (cid:28) 1. Fur-
thermore, the total neutrino cooling from all ocean pairs
i Xi · L34,i ≈ 0.24 for X-ray burst ashes and ≈ 0.06 for
superburst ashes. Moreover, a majority of ocean pairs
have experimentally measured f t-values and the result-
ing uncertainty in L34 is less than a factor of ≈ 2 and
insuﬃcient to allow X · L34 > 1. Therefore, we expect an
ocean with Urca pairs to have a steady state tempera-
ture and carbon ignition depth consistent with an ocean
without Urca pairs.

the ignition of unstable carbon burning in a mixed iron-carbon
ocean with XFe = 0.8 and XC = 0.2. The solid-black curves
indicate ocean’s without Urca cooling layers. In each panel, the
lower dotted-blue curve is for X · L34 = 100 and the upper dotted-
blue curve is for X · L34 = 10, for Urca pairs located at: Panel

y = 1011 g cm−2.

vide Qb = 0.25 MeV per accreted nucleon into the ocean,
which gives ignition at yign,0 = 1012 g cm−2 for this ac-
cretion rate. A light element column of hydrogen and
helium extends from the neutron star surface to a depth
y = 108 g cm−2 (Brown & Bildsten 1998).

To examine the impact of Urca cooling’s location on
the ocean temperature, we run three models with diﬀer-
ent Urca pair locations at y/yign,0 = 0.1, 1, 10. We test
the two values X·L34 = 10, 100 for each Urca pair to rep-
resent the characteristic strength of ocean Urca pairs (see
Table 1). In Figure 2 is the ocean’s steady state temper-
ature during accretion for the three diﬀerent Urca pair
locations.

Neutrino emission from ocean Urca pairs lowers the
ocean’s steady state temperature; for example, at the
depth of the Urca pair the temperature decreases by

3.2. Crust Urca pairs

The neutrino luminosity from an Urca pair scales as
|QEC|5, which means that crust Urca pairs are a factor
of ∼ 100–1000 more luminous than ocean pairs. Fur-
thermore, for the abundances of X-ray burst ashes and
superburst ashes (Schatz et al. 2014), crust Urca pairs
have between X·L34 ∼ 10–100, as can be seen in Table 2.
As a consequence, crust pairs are more likely to be strong
coolers at the temperatures of interest near ∼ 109 K. Al-
though crust Urca pairs are located at depths y (cid:29) yign,
they may lower the ocean’s steady state temperature by
limiting the net heat ﬂux entering the ocean from crustal
and extra heating.
To determine the eﬀect of crust Urca pairs on the ocean
temperature, we ﬁrst calculate X · L34 values for the
strongest Urca pairs identiﬁed in the crust (Schatz et
al.
2014). The mass fractions of Urca pairs are taken

al. 2014). The crust Urca pairs, along with their loca-
tion and X · L34 values, are shown in Table 2. We place
all Urca pairs with X · L34 > 1 into the same neutron
star thermal evolution model used in Section 3.1.

In Figure 3 we show ocean steady state temperature
proﬁles for Qb = 0.1, 0.25, 1.0, 2.0 MeV per accreted nu-
cleon including all crust pairs with X · L34 > 1. Be-
cause ≈ 10 % of crustal heating enters the ocean during
steady state (Brown 2000), these values of Qb repre-
sent respectively Qshallow ≈ 1, 5, 10, 15 MeV per accreted
nucleon of extra heating in the crust. These values
of Qshallow are representative of the observational con-
straints on shallow heating from neutron star transients;
for example, ≈ 1 MeV per accreted nucleon is needed in
KS 1731-260 and MXB 1659-29 (Brown & Cumming
2009), and ≈ 6–16 MeV per accreted nucleon is needed
in MAXI J0556-332 (Deibel et al. 2015).
As can be seen in Figure 3, crust Urca pairs lower the
ocean’s steady state temperature by removing ≈ 80−90%
of the crustal heat ﬂux Fb entering the ocean. The ocean
temperature is limited to T (cid:46) 109 K (T (cid:46) 7 × 108 K)
at y (cid:46) 1014 g cm−2 for X-ray burst ashes (superburst
ashes). The carbon ignition depth increases when crust
pairs are present, for all values of Qb. For example, for
a heat ﬂux Qb = 0.25 MeV per accreted nucleon car-
bon ignition occurs at yign = 1012 g cm−2 without Urca
cooling, whereas carbon ignition occurs near yign ≈ 5 ×
1012 g cm−2 with crust Urca pairs from X-ray burst ashes
are present. The largest crustal heat ﬂux Qb = 2 MeV
per accreted nucleon gives the shallowest ignition depth
near yign ≈ 2 × 1011 g cm−2 (yign ≈ 2 × 1012 g cm−2) for
X-ray burst pairs (superburst pairs).

3.3. The superburst in 4U 1636-536

The shallow ignition of the superburst in 4U 1636-536
(Wijnands 2001; Strohmayer & Markwardt 2002; Keek
et al. 2014a,b) near yign ≈ 2 × 1011 g cm−2 (Keek et
al. 2015) is consistent with a crust made of X-ray burst
ashes and Qb ≈ 2 MeV per accreted nucleon, as can be
seen in Figure 3. Given the uncertainties in e−-capture/
β−-decay f t-values, however, carbon ignition depths con-
sistent with the superburst ignition depth in 4U 1636-536
can be found for smaller values of Qb and in a crust com-
posed of superburst ashes.

Crust Urca pairs are composed of more neutron-rich
nuclei than ocean pairs. These neutron-rich nuclei lay
far from stability and only 29Mg and 33Al have measured
f t-values. The other crust Urca pairs have at least a
factor of ≈ 10 uncertainties in the transition strength f t-
value and thereby a factor of ≈ 10 uncertainty in their
neutrino luminosities. Note that similar uncertainties
near a factor of ≈ 10 are possible in the calculation of X
due to reaction rate uncertainties (Parikh et al. 2008).
For the crust pairs without measured f t-values, we now
examine the neutrino luminosities within the uncertainty
in the f t-value. In Figure 4 we show ocean temperature
proﬁles for X ·L34 for the abundances in X-ray burst and
superburst ashes, for a factor of 10 reduction and a factor
of 10 enhancement in the f t-value. Note that a reduction
in the f t-value increases the neutrino luminosity of the
Urca pair (see Equation 6).
A crust composed of X-ray burst ashes and a value of
Qb ≈ 2 MeV per accreted nucleon allow carbon ignition

near yign ≈ 2×1011 g cm−2 for f t-values calculated using
our method. Taking into account the uncertainty in f t-
values, carbon ignition at this depth is allowed for Qb =
1.0 MeV per accreted nucleon if f t-values are enhanced
by a factor of 10 in X-ray burst ashes, as can be seen in
Figure 4.

In a crust composed of superburst ashes, even a large
value of extra heating Qb = 2 MeV per accreted nucleon
is not consistent with carbon ignition below yign (cid:46) 2 ×
1012 g cm−2. When uncertainties in f t-values are taken
into account, however, carbon ignition at this depth is
allowed for Qb = 2.0 MeV per accreted nucleon if f t-
values are enhanced by a factor of 10 in superburst ashes.
In addition to nuclear physics uncertainties, a shal-
lower extra heat source can reconcile carbon ignition
with the inferred superburst ignition depth in 4U 1636-

536. In the previous sections, we place the extra heat-
ing at depths greater than crust Urca pairs (y (cid:38) 2 ×
1015 g cm−2) following the approach of previous carbon
ignition models (Brown & Bildsten 1998; Cumming &
Bildsten 2001). The extra heating may be shallower,
however, as is the case in neutron star transients. For
example, extra heating in KS 1731-260 and MXB 1659-
29 must be y (cid:46) 2 × 1014 g cm−2 to ﬁt quiescent light
curves, and in MAXI J0556-332 the inferred extra heat-
ing is between y ≈ 2 × 1013–2 × 1014 g cm−2 (Deibel et

al. 2015).

To examine carbon ignition conditions with a shal-
lower extra heat source, we place extra heating at the
depth constrained in MAXI J0556-322, between y ≈
2 × 1013–2 × 1014 g cm−2. Extra heating deposited in
this region means that the ocean temperature at y (cid:46)
8 × 1013 g cm−2 is unaﬀected by neutrino cooling from
crust Urca pairs and crust pairs do not impact the car-
bon ignition depth. In Figure 5 are ocean temperature
proﬁles for Qshallow = 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 MeV per accreted nu-

4. URCA COOLING AND SUPERBURST LIGHT

CURVES

9

The strong T 5 dependence of the Urca pair neutrino
luminosity means that ocean Urca pairs become more
luminous after superburst ignition, when the ocean tem-
perature reaches T (cid:38) 109 K during carbon burning. To
examine the impact of ocean Urca pairs after super-
burst ignition we predict superburst light curves follow-
ing the model of Cumming & Macbeth (2004), which
assumes that nuclear burning during the superburst oc-
curs quickly and sets the initial temperature proﬁle for
the cooling light curve. The average energy input during
the superburst is E18 ≡ Enuc/(1018 ergs g−1) and the ini-
tial cooling temperature proﬁle is a power law with depth
T ∝ yα, where y ≈ 3.6 × 1012 g cm−2ρ4/3
(Ye/0.4)4/3
is the column depth. We follow the thermal evolu-
tion from the initial temperature proﬁle using the code
burstcool2, which integrates the heat diﬀusion equation
assuming constant gravity over the bursting layer, and
the emergent ﬂux is redshifted to an observer at inﬁnity.
To explore Urca cooling’s eﬀect on light curve pre-
dictions, we examine two superburst ignition depths,
yign = 3.6 × 1011 g cm−2 and yign = 3.6 × 1012 g cm−2,
for a neutron star mass M = 1.4 M(cid:12), neutron star ra-
dius R = 11 km, and g14 = 1.53. An Urca cooling pair
is placed in close proximity to the superburst ignition
layer at y = 0.4 yign in both superbursts. Note that be-
neath the ignition layer (y > yign) the temperature is
T (cid:46) 5 × 108 K and cooling from ocean Urca pairs is
small. Therefore, we only show models with an Urca
pair located shallower than ignition (y < yign) where the
temperature is T (cid:38) 109 K at the outset of cooling. The
cooling light curve predictions for these superbursts are
shown in Figure 6 for X · L34 = 100 and 1000.
In the absence of Urca cooling pairs, the superburst

and yign = 3.2 × 1012 g cm−2. The red dotted curves are models

with ignition depth yign = 3.6 × 1011 g cm−2 (yign =
3.6 × 1012 g cm−2) has a peak luminosity Lpeak ≈ 4 ×
1037 ergs s−1 (Lpeak ≈ 2 × 1037 ergs s−1). Urca cool-
ing only minimally aﬀects the peak superburst lumi-
nosity because Lν (cid:28) Lpeak, even for Urca pairs with
X · L34 = 1000, as can be seen in Figure 6. Urca cooling
generally causes an earlier and more rapid decline of the
superburst cooling light curve, similar to a light curve
with a reduced ignition depth. At the abundances pre-
dicted for X-ray burst and superburst ashes, ocean pairs
located at y < yign have X · L34 (cid:28) 1 and do not impact
superburst cooling light curves. Moreover, ocean pairs
with unmeasured f t-values do not have X · L34 > 1 even
with a factor of 10 reduction in the f t-value.

5. DISCUSSION

We have explored the neutrino luminosities of 85 Urca
pairs in the neutron star ocean near the depths in-
ferred for superburst ignition between yign ≈ 0.5–3 ×
1012 g cm−2 (Cumming et al. 2006). We ﬁnd that Urca
cooling occurs throughout an ocean composed of X-ray
burst and/or superburst ashes. When combined with
the crust Urca pairs previously identiﬁed (Schatz et al.
2014), our results suggest that Urca cooling occurs at
varying strengths throughout the entire outer crust at
mass densities 106 (cid:46) ρ (cid:46) 4 × 1011 g cm−3.

At large enough abundances ocean Urca pairs have
the potential to cool the ocean and increase carbon ig-
nition depths. At the abundances calculated from X-ray
burst and superburst nuclear burning (Schatz et al.
2014), however, ocean pairs have weak neutrino lumi-
nosities (X · L34 (cid:28) 1) and do not impact carbon ignition
depths. Furthermore, the neutrino luminosities of ocean
Urca pairs located at y (cid:46) yign are too weak to cause
an early decline of the superburst light curve. That is,
ocean pairs have no eﬀect on the cooling light curve be-
cause their neutrino luminosities are small relative to the
superburst peak luminosity (Lν (cid:28) Lpeak) even in the hot
post-superburst ocean near T (cid:38) 109 K.

For the abundances predicted from X-ray burst and
superburst nuclear burning, crust Urca pairs have strong
neutrino luminosities (between X · L34 ∼ 10–100) and
increase carbon ignition depths even though they cool
at greater depths y (cid:29) yign. Crust Urca pairs lower the

ocean’s steady state temperature by preventing a ma-
jority (≈ 80–90%) of the net crustal and extra heating
from entering the ocean, as shown in Figure 3. In a crust
composed of X-ray burst ashes, the ocean temperature
is limited to T (cid:46) 109 K in the carbon ignition region and
ignition depths are limited to yign (cid:38) 2 × 1011 g cm−2. In
a crust composed of superburst ashes, the ocean tem-
perature is limited to T (cid:46) 7 × 108 K and carbon ig-
nition depths are limited to yign (cid:38) 2 × 1012 g cm−2.
Once nuclear uncertainties are taken into account, al-
lowed carbon ignition depths are yign (cid:38) 1011 g cm−2
(yign (cid:38) 2 × 1011 g cm−2) in a crust composed of X-ray
burst (superburst) ashes.

Our results suggest that the cooling thermal compo-
nent of the February 2001 superburst in 4U 1636-536
(Wijnands 2001; Strohmayer & Markwardt 2002; Keek
et al. 2014a,b) is likely not caused by Urca cooling in
the ocean. The cooling light curve declines much faster
after the superburst peak than model predictions (with
uncertainties about the spectral model used to ﬁt the
data, see discussion in Keek et al. 2015). Because the
light curve declines after the superburst peak, Urca cool-
ing would need to be near the carbon ignition depth to
explain the cooling trend (Keek et al.
2015). For the
ignition depth near that of the superburst in 4U 1636-
536 (yign ≈ 2 × 1011 g cm−2), only Urca cooling pairs
present at depths y (cid:46) yign will impact cooling predic-
tions; however, these ocean pairs are typically weak with
X · L34 (cid:28) 1 and do not eﬀect cooling light curve predic-
tions. Indeed, Urca cooling in the ocean only marginally
eﬀects light curve predictions even for X · L34 = 1000, as
can be seen in Figure 6.
The shallow ignition depth in 4U 1636-536 near yign ≈
2 × 1011 g cm−2 (Keek et al. 2015) provides constraints
on the strength of extra heating and the composition
of the crust in this source. A shallow heating source
Qshallow ≈ 9 MeV per accreted nucleon is the minimum
strength required to ignite carbon at this depth in a crust
composed of X-ray burst ashes; if composed of super-
burst ashes the minimum heating strength is Qshallow ≈
15 MeV per accreted nucleon. A weaker shallow heat
source is consistent with neutron star transients that
have similar accretion rates between ˙m ∼ 0.1–0.3 ˙mEdd,
for instance MXB 1659-29 requires ≈ 1 MeV per ac-
creted nucleon (Brown & Cumming 2009). Moreover,
superburst ignition models ﬁnd that several type-I X-ray
bursts occur during the intervals between the more en-
ergetic superbursts (Keek et al. 2012). It is likely that
the crust in 4U 1636-536 is composed primarily of X-
ray burst ashes, which accumulate in the crust over the
course of ∼ 100–1000 years in the more frequent type-I
X-ray bursts, and cooling from Urca pairs in these ashes
prevails over cooling from pairs in the less abundant su-
perburst ashes.
By contrast, extra heating may be deposited shallower
than most crust Urca pairs y (cid:46) 2× 1014 g cm−2 as is the
case in neutron star transients with extra shallow heat-

ing; for example, KS 1731-260 and MXB 1659-29 (Brown
& Cumming 2009), and MAXI J0556-332 (Deibel et al.
2015). When deposited at shallower depths, an extra
heating strength of Qshallow ≈ 4 MeV per accreted nu-
cleon is required to have carbon ignition at depths consis-
tent with the superburst ignition depth in 4U 1636-536,
as can be seen in Figure 5. In this case, no constraints on
crust composition are possible because crust Urca pairs
do not alter the temperature in the superburst ignition
region. It may be interesting to search for transients that
show superbursts during outburst because the quiescent
cooling may potentially indicate the existence of extra
heating and its depth. A comparison of the strength
and depth of extra heating with the inferred superburst
ignition depth will then allow constraints on the crust
composition.

The nuclear properties of neutron-rich nuclei are im-
portant input for determining the strength of Urca cool-
ing. Although the QEC values for nuclei in the ocean are
determined from mass measurements to within ≈ 1 %
2012), f t-values and excited state ener-
(Audi et al.
gies are more uncertain. Shell model calculations of all
odd-A nuclei in rp-process burning ashes are needed to
determine excited state energies and transition strengths
to higher accuracy. Furthermore, experimentally de-
termined f t-values and mass measurements of neutron-
rich nuclei, for instance at the Facility for Rare-Isotope
Beams (FRIB), will allow more accurate determinations
of Urca pair neutrino luminosities and thereby improve
constraints on the interior of superbursting neutron stars.
