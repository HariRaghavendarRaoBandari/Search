BUILDING HYPERBOLIC METRICS SUITED TO CLOSED

CURVES AND APPLICATIONS TO LIFTING SIMPLY

TARIK AOUGAB, JONAH GASTER, PRIYAM PATEL, JENYA SAPIR

Abstract. Let γ be an essential closed curve with at most k self-intersections
on a surface S with negative Euler characteristic. In this paper, we construct
a hyperbolic metric ρ for which γ has length at most M · √
k, where M is
a constant depending only on the topology of S. Moreover, the injectivity
radius of ρ is at least 1/(2
k). This yields linear upper bounds in terms of
self-intersection number on the minimum degree of a cover to which γ lifts as a
simple closed curve (i.e. lifts simply). We also show that if γ is a closed curve
with length at most L on a cusped hyperbolic surface S, then there exists a
cover of S of degree at most N ·L·eL/2 to which γ lifts simply, for N depending
only on the topology of S.

1. Introduction

Let S be an orientable surface of negative Euler characteristic and of ﬁnite type.
It is a consequence of a well-known result of P. Scott [18] that every closed curve

γ on S lifts to a simple closed curve in a ﬁnite degree cover (cid:101)Sγ of S; we say that
γ lifts simply to (cid:101)Sγ. For a closed curve γ on S, let deg(γ) be the smallest degree

of a cover where γ lifts simply. Recently, there has been an eﬀort to prove eﬀective
versions of Scott’s result by obtaining bounds on deg(γ) [6, 7, 14]. One of the main
goals of this paper is to study the dependence of deg(γ) on two other notions of
complexity; the geometric self-intersection number i(γ, γ) of the curve, and, ﬁxing
a complete hyperbolic metric ρ on S, the length (cid:96)ρ(γ).

We are interested in the following two functions, deﬁned in [7]:

fρ(L) = max{deg(γ) : (cid:96)ρ(γ) ≤ L} , and
fS (k) = max{deg(γ) : i(γ, γ) ≤ k} .

√

In order to study these functions, we consider the relationship between the length
and self-intersection number of closed curves on hyperbolic surfaces. This has been
studied extensively in a variety of diﬀerent contexts (see e.g. [1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 16]).
Our main contribution to this story is Theorem 1.4, in which we produce a metric
ρ for each curve γ of self-intersection at most k on S so that γ has ρ-length at most
k. Theorem 1.4 implies upper bounds for curve degrees (see
a constant times
Theorem 1.7), and lower bounds for fS are provided by [6, Thm. 1.2].
Recall that f = Θ(g) means that there are constants c1 and c2 so that c1g(x) ≤
f (x) ≤ c2g(x) for all x. We obtain:
Corollary 1.1 (Linear growth of fS ). We have fS (k) = Θ(k), with constants that
depend only on the topology of S.

In Theorem 1.10, we analyze the relationship of the length of a curve on a
cusped hyperbolic surface to the length of the corresponding curve when the cusps
have been ‘opened’ to geodesic boundary. Together with [14, Thm. 1.1] we obtain
upper bounds for fρ when (S, ρ) has cusps, and lower bounds are provided by [6,
Thm. 1.4]. We obtain:
Corollary 1.2 (Exponential growth of fρ in cusped case). Suppose that (S, ρ) is a
hyperbolic surface with at least one cusp. Then there exists L0(ρ) > 0 and constants
C1 and C2 depending only on the topology of S so that for each L ≥ L0,

C1 · e

A natural question left open in our work is which of these two bounds is sharp.
Finally, Theorem 1.4 informs the quantitative understanding of inﬁma of length
functions associated to curves on S. Note that there are only ﬁnitely many mapping
class group orbits of closed curves with k self-intersections on S. Each such orbit
determines a length function on the moduli space of hyperbolic structures on S, and
this length function has an inﬁmum. Let mk(S) and mk(S) indicate the minimum
and maximum, respectively, of the inﬁma among mapping class group orbits of
curves of self-intersection k.
In [1, Cor. 1.4], Basmajian shows that mk(S) is Θ(log k), and it’s a consequence
of the construction in the ﬁrst part of [1, Cor. 1.3] that mk(S) grows at least like
√
k. Theorem 1.4 immediately implies:

Corollary 1.3. We have mk(S) = Θ(
1.1. Self-intersection and lengths of curves. In [1, Thm. 1.1], Basmajian
shows that for any closed curve γ of self-intersection k on a compact hyperbolic
k ≤ (cid:96)ρ(γ), where cρ is a constant depending on the
metric ρ. The following provides a complementary upper bound, answering the
second question asked in [5]:

where C3 is a constant depending only on S. Furthermore, the injectivity radius of
ρ is at least 1/(2

√

k).

The proof relies on recent work of the fourth author [17], in which a careful
accounting of mapping class group orbits of curves is obtained. Brieﬂy, we choose a
pants decomposition (quoting [17, Prop. 1.4]) so that γ has controlled intersection
with the pants cuﬀs. With such a pants decomposition in hand, we obtain a natural
decomposition of the curve into arcs (see Section 3), and careful choices for lengths
of pants cuﬀs are made so that the sum of the lengths of the constituent arcs can
be controlled. The systole estimate arises naturally.

Remark 1.5. In many concrete cases, the method of proof of Theorem 1.4 produces
a metric with an improved systole length. This allows the applications to degree
(see Theorem 1.7) to be strengthened. For further discussion, see Section 5.1 and
Remark 5.5.

1.2. Bounds on fρ and fS for surfaces without cusps. In [18], Scott explicitly
constructs a regular, right-angled pentagonal tiling for any surface of negative Euler
characteristic. We now ﬁx the notation ρ0 for the hyperbolic metric on S arising
from this tiling. In [14], the third author used ρ0 to obtain an upper bound on
fρ(L) that is linear in L in the case where (S, ρ) does not have any cusps.
In
particular, for ρ0 one has fρ0(L) < 16.2 · L [14, Thm 1.1]. Gupta-Kapovich then
gave a lower bound on fρ(L) [7] that was recently improved upon by the second
author. Combining the results of the second author [6] and third author [14] gives
the following description of fρ(L) found in [6, pp. 3]:
Corollary 1.6 (Gaster, Patel). If (S, ρ) is a hyperbolic surface without cusps, there
exists a constant C = C(S) > 0 and L0 = L0(ρ) > 0 such that for L ≥ L0,

where sys(ρ) is the systole of (S, ρ).

As noted by Gupta-Kapovich, a lower bound on fρ(L) gives a lower bound on
fS (k) by appealing to a theorem of Basmajian [1, Thm. 1.1]. In [6], the second
author also improved the lower bound on fS (k) obtained by Gupta-Kapovich with-
out appealing to Basmajian’s work relating self-intersection number and length of
a closed curve, but rather by analyzing a speciﬁc family of curves (also analyzed by
Basmajian [1, Prop. 4.2]). In particular, [6, Thm. 1.2] shows that fS (k) ≥ k + 1.
Our goal is to produce a complementary upper bound on fS (k) that is linear in k.
Unfortunately, the upper bound on fρ(L) from [14] does not immediately yield an
upper bound on fS (k) as there exist arbitrarily long closed curves on a hyperbolic
surface with few (or no) self-intersections. This issue is addressed by Theorem 1.4
above, in which a metric ρ is produced that is well suited to a comparison between
(cid:96)ρ(γ) and the self-intersection i(γ, γ).

As in [6, Lem. 7], the change in length arising from the passage from ρ back to
ρ0 can be controlled via the work of Lenzhen-Raﬁ-Tao [11] on optimal Lipschitz
constants between hyperbolic surfaces, with the caveat that control on the systole
length of ρ is required. This demonstrates the use of the systole estimate in the
conclusion of Theorem 1.4.

We note that an argument in the style of [8] could result in a crude upper bound
for fS (k) that is exponential in k. Our theorem represents a vast improvement on
this naive bound.
Theorem 1.7. There is a constant C4 depending only on S such that fS (k) ≤ C4·k.
Proof. Suppose γ is a closed curve on S with at most k self-intersections. If neces-
sary, replace any punctures of S with boundary components, and note that deg(γ)
on S so that γ has ρ-length at most C3 · √
is unaﬀected by this change. By Theorem 1.4, there is a 1/(2
k)-thick metric ρ
k. Translating [11, Thm. E] as in [6,
Lem. 7], there is a constant C0 depending only on ρ0 so that there is a Lipschitz
map from ρ to ρ0 with Lipschitz constant C0/ sys(ρ).

√

Thus we have

(cid:96)ρ0(γ) ≤ C0
sys(ρ)

· (cid:96)ρ(γ) ≤ 2C0 · C3 · k ,

and [14, Thm 1.1] completes the proof.

In fact, it is possible to achieve the conclusion of Theorem 1.7 without resorting
to the kind of length control obtained in Theorem 1.4, an argument communicated
to us by Justin Malestein [12]. This argument uses the ﬁniteness of the number
of mapping class group orbits of incompressibly embedded roses on S, and ﬁnds a
curve in the mapping class group orbit of γ whose ρ0-length can be controlled so
that one may invoke [14, Thm. 1.1] directly. On the other hand, in addition to its
independent interest, Theorem 1.4 includes ﬁne control on the geometry of γ on S,
and this control can be used to deduce more information about degrees of curves.
For instance, our proof of Theorem 1.7 also yields control over the dependence of
degree on the Euler characteristic of the underlying surface S. Precisely, we show:
Theorem 1.8. There exists a function F : N2 → N and a universal constant R
satisfying:

(1) For any orientable surface S of ﬁnite type, fS (k) ≤ F (|χ(S)|, k);
(2) For each a ∈ N, F (a, y) = O (y);
(3) For each b ∈ N, F (x, b) = O (Rx).

√

the 1/(2

√

Proof. The constant C3 in the statement of Theorem 1.4 grows at most exponen-
tially in the genus of the underlying surface S; indeed, examining each of the terms
in the inequality at the beginning of the proof of Theorem 1.4 carefully, we see that
C3 depends polynomially on the constant C in the statement of Lemma 4.1, which
in turn depends quadratically on the constant D in the statement of Lemma 3.1.
This last statement and the proof of Lemmas 3.1 and 4.1 in [17] demonstrate an
exponential upper bound for the growth of C3 as a function of |χ(S)|.
Therefore, for γ a closed curve on S with i(γ, γ) ≤ k, Theorem 1.4 yields a
≤ (R(cid:48))|χ(S)| · √
k), for which γ has length
k for some universal constant R(cid:48) > 0. Then by [15], the diameter of
is at most R(cid:48)(cid:48) · √
k)-thick part of the Moduli space (equipped with the Teichm¨uller metric)
k · log(|χ(S)|), for some universal R(cid:48)(cid:48). As the Teichm¨uller metric
bounds the Lipschitz metric from above, it follows that (cid:96)ρ0(γ) is bounded above by
(R(cid:48))|χ(S)|√

hyperbolic metric with injectivity radius at least 1/(2

Then choose R (cid:29) max(R(cid:48), R(cid:48)(cid:48)), and again appealing to [14, Thm 1.1], we have
that the degree of γ is at most 16.2 · F1. We conclude by letting F (|χ(S)|, k) :=
min(16.2 · F1, C4 · k), where C4 is the constant from Theorem 1.7.

k =: F1(|χ(S)|, k).

1.3. Bounds on fρ for surfaces with cusps. In our study of fρ when ρ has
cusps, it will be useful to compare the length of a curve on the cusped surface to
its length when the cusps have been replaced with geodesic boundary components.
Note that ρ0 below could be any hyperbolic metric on S without cusps, though in
the applications that follow we are only concerned with Scott’s pentagonally-tiled
metric.
Theorem 1.9. Let (S, ρ) be a hyperbolic surface with at least one cusp and ρ0 a
metric on S without cusps. Then there exists an L0 > 0 and a constant C0 = C0(ρ0)
depending on ρ0, such for any L ≥ L0 and any closed curve γ on S with (cid:96)ρ(γ) ≤ L
we have (cid:96)ρ0(γ) ≤ C0 · L · e L
2 .

In [6], the second author obtains an interesting lower bound on fρ(L) in the case
where (S, ρ) is a hyperbolic surface with at least one cusp, which in particular shows

BUILDING METRICS AND APPLICATIONS TO LIFTING

5

that the upper bound on fρ(L) in Corollary 1.6 cannot hold in the cusped setting.
Speciﬁcally, it is shown that when (S, ρ) is a hyperbolic surface with at least one
cusp, fρ(L) is roughly bounded from below by eL/2. It is important to note deg(γ)
is independent of the metric on S. The discrepancy between the linear upper bound
for fρ(L) in the compact case and the exponential lower bound in the cusped case
arises from the change in the length of a closed curve on a compact hyperbolic
surface as we let the lengths of boundary curves go to zero. As an application of
the length estimate in Theorem 1.9 we obtain the following upper bound for fρ(L)
in the cusped case:
Theorem 1.10. Let (S, ρ) be a hyperbolic surface with at least one cusp. Then
there exists L0 > 0 such that for any L ≥ L0 we have
fρ(L) ≤ C2 · L · eL/2

where C2 = 16.2 · C0 and C0 is a constant that depends only on S.
Proof. Given γ on (S, ρ) with (cid:96)ρ(γ) ≤ L, Theorem 1.9 gives us that (cid:96)ρ0(γ) ≤
C0 · L · eL/2, where C0 depends on the metric ρ0. Since ρ0 is ﬁxed once and for
all as Scott’s pentagonally-tiled metric on S, the constant C0 depends only on the
topology of S. By Theorem 1.1 of [14], we have

deg(γ) ≤ 16.2 · (cid:96)ρ0(γ) ≤ 16.2 · C0 · L · eL/2 ,

which completes the proof.

(cid:3)

We prove Theorem 1.9 in Section 2. We introduce our combinatorial terminology
in Section 3 and prove some related technical estimates in Section 4. Theorem 1.4
is proved in Section 5, after which we conclude with some remarks and questions.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.9

Proof of Theorem 1.9. In what follows we use the shorthand S and S0 for the hy-
perbolic surfaces (S, ρ) and (S, ρ0), respectively. When these surfaces have non-
compact, inﬁnite volume ends, we replace such ends with totally geodesic boundary
components. The result is unaﬀected by this change since the geodesic representa-
tive of a closed curve γ on S never penetrates a non-compact end.
Every cusp c of S has an embedded neighborhood Nc topologically equivalent to a
cylinder, bounded by a horocycle Hc of length 2. Let H0 be an embedded horocycle
(parameterized by a parameter t with respect to arclength) on the interior of Nc,
whose length we denote by l(H0). Then Nc can be parameterized by coordinates

(2.0.1)

(ρ, t) ∈ (−∞, d(0)] × S1 ,

where d(0) is the distance between H0 and Hc. With respect to this parameteriza-
tion the hyperbolic metric can be expressed as

ds2 = dρ2 + l2(H0)e2ρdt2 .

Concretely, if x = (ρ, t) ∈ Nc, then ρ is the signed distance between x and H0
(where we deﬁne the distance between x and H0 to be negative if and only if H0 does
not separate x from the cusp), and t is the unique time so that the perpendicular
from x to H0 intersects H0 at time t.

Let η be a totally geodesic boundary component of a hyperbolic surface. By the
collar lemma, there exists an embedded half-collar neighborhood Nη topologically
equivalent to a cylinder, and metrically equivalent to a cylinder coordinatized by

Now, let γ have length ≤ L on S. Let S(cid:48) denote the surface obtained from
S by replacing each cusp with a totally geodesic boundary component of length
e−L/2. In other words, after specifying S = {(l1, θ1), ..., (li, θi)} in Fenchel-Nielsen
coordinates with respect to some choice of pants decomposition, lj = 0 for at least
one j (by assumption that S has at least one cusp). Then S(cid:48) is the surface with
the same Fenchel-Nielsen parameters after replacing each length 0 coordinate with
a length coordinate equal to e−L/2.
We will show that given any  > 0, there exists L suﬃciently large so that γ
admits a representative of length ≤ L +  on S(cid:48). Assuming this, we complete the
argument as follows: for suﬃciently large L, e−L/2 will be the length of the shortest
homotopically non-trivial curve on S(cid:48), and therefore there is a Lipschitz map with
Lipschitz constant bounded by C0 · eL/2, between S(cid:48) and the surface S0, where C0
is a topological constant depending on S (see [11] and [6, Lem. 7] for details and
for a description of the constant C0). It then follows that the length of γ is at most
C0 · (L + ) · eL/2 on S0, and replacing C0 by a slightly larger constant C1, we have
that the length of γ is at most C1 · L · eL/2 on S0.
Thus, we have reduced the problem to showing that for L suﬃciently large, the
length of γ on S(cid:48) is at most L + . To avoid confusion, henceforth we will refer
to the geodesic representative of γ on S(cid:48) as γ(cid:48). Note that on S, γ can penetrate
at most L/2 into Nc for any cusp c of S. For a > 1, the horocycle of length 2/a
is located at a signed distance of log(a) from Hc. Thus the horocycle of length
e−L/2, which we denote by HL, is at a distance of log(2) + L/2 from Hc, and thus
it separates γ from the cusp c. We make a direct comparison between the metric
on Nc with respect to the horocycle HL, and the metric on S(cid:48) when viewed from
a boundary component η of length e−L/2: since cosh2(r) < e2r for any r > 0, it
follows that the metric tensor on the half-collar neighborhood Nη is bounded above
by the metric tensor on the subset of Nc bounded between Hc and HL.
c Nc, where the union
is taken over all cusps c of S; Wc is a compact region of H2 bounded by ﬁnitely
many geodesic segments and ﬁnitely many segments of horocycles. Let Wη denote
η Nη, where the union is taken over all boundary
components of S(cid:48) coming from cusps of S. Then as L → ∞, Wη converges in the
Gromov-Hausdorﬀ sense to Wc. Thus, for L suﬃciently large, the metric on the
subsurface of S corresponding to the quotient of Wc by π1(S), is arbitrarily close to
the metric on the subsurface of S(cid:48) corresponding to the quotient of Wη by π1(S(cid:48)).
Now, γ decomposes as a union of geodesic arcs with endpoints on Hc, and
similarly γ(cid:48) can be written as a concatenation of geodesic arcs with endpoints
on ∂Nη. The interior of each arc of γ (resp. γ(cid:48)) lies completely within Nc (resp.

Nη) or completely within Wc/π1(S) (resp. Wη/π1(S(cid:48))). Thus we can compare the
length of γ to that of γ(cid:48) arc-wise: corresponding arcs in the complement of Nc and
Nη are uniformly comparable within (cid:48) (chosen smaller than /n, where n is the
total number of arcs) by geometric convergence of Wη to Wc, and arcs of γ(cid:48) within
Nη have length bounded above by the corresponding arc in Nc since the metric
tensor on Nη is bounded above by the metric on Nc. By this we mean that if p, p(cid:48)
are two paths, one in Nc and the other in Nη respectively, so that p and p(cid:48) have
the same parameterization in coordinates, the length of p(cid:48) is at most that of p.

Expounding on this last point, geometric convergence of Wη to Wc implies that
by choosing L suﬃciently large, the coordinates (in the circle S1) of the endpoints
of any arc in S on Hc can be chosen to be arbitrarily close to the coordinates of
the endpoints of the corresponding arc in S(cid:48). Therefore, for any arc λ in Nη, we
can choose a parameterization in the coordinates of (2.0.2) that is arbitrarily close
to the parameterization (in the coordinates of (2.0.1)) of the corresponding arc in
Nc; note that this parametrization may not yield the geodesic representative of λ
on Nη, and note also that we are using the fact that

Since the coordinates of λ agrees with those of its counterpart on S (up to arbitrarily
small precision), and the metric tensor on Nc is an upper bound for the metric on
Nη, the length of λ is bounded above by the length of its counterpart on S.

3. Combinatorial models for closed curves

We begin with the combinatorial decomposition of a curve necessary for the
proof of Theorem 1.4. For convenience we will assume that S is compact in this
construction; after proving Theorem 1.4 in that setting, we will deduce it in the
case that S has cusps or non-compact ends. In everything that follows, the curve γ
on S of self-intersection k is ﬁxed. The ﬁrst step is to choose a pants decomposition
on S that is ‘well-balanced’ with respect to γ, a construction contained in [17].
Lemma 3.1. [17, Proposition 4.3] There is a constant D = D(S) and a pants
decomposition P = P(γ) of S so that γ intersects each cuﬀ at most D

k times.

√

The pants decomposition P is ﬁxed in everything that follows.

3.1. Realizing γ as a cycle in a graph on S. We ﬁx a graph in each pair of
pants so that each pants cuﬀ is homotopic to a cycle of length two, and so that the
complement of the graph consists of two hexagons, as shown in Figure 1. We will call
the edges of this graph that connect distinct pants cuﬀs seam edges, and the other
edges boundary edges. We glue together pants according to the combinatorics of the
pants decomposition obtained in Lemma 3.1, gluing boundary edges to boundary
edges and seam endpoints to seam endpoints. This way we obtain an embedded
graph G on S. Note that its vertices have valence four on the interior of S and
valence three on the boundary.
The pants decomposition P from Lemma 3.1 makes the construction of hyper-
bolic structures on S possible ‘by hand’: A hyperbolic structure on a pair of pants
with geodesic boundary is determined up to isometry by the lengths of the cuﬀ
curves, and one may glue the pants along their geodesic boundaries by matching

seams to seams appropriately according to the combinatorics of P. The conclusion
of Theorem 1.4 is achieved by describing careful choices of length coordinates for
the pants decomposition obtained in Lemma 3.1, and by making judicious choices
of twisting γ around cuﬀs to control its length. We note that with respect to nat-
ural choices for the Fenchel-Nielsen cordinates of the Teichm¨uller space of S, any
metric we construct will have ‘twist coordinates’ equal to half-integers, which we
refer to below as a convenient metric on S.
Every closed curve on S is homotopic to a cycle of G. There is natural ambiguity
in this description of the curve as a cycle, which we eliminate as follows. Choose a
convenient hyperbolic structure on S, and realize the graph G so that each of the
seam edges is the simple geodesic arc orthogonal to a pair of pants cuﬀs, and so
that each boundary edge is half of the geodesic representative of a pants cuﬀ.

For any closed curve η, realize it as a closed geodesic. Following the construction
in [17, Lemma 2.2], we obtain a cycle c(η) freely homotopic to η (Figure 2). Loosely
speaking, the cycle c(η) is formed by pushing η onto the graph G so that it has the
fewest visits to pants curves among all cycles in G homotopic to η. (Note that in
[17], c(η) is refered to as a word wΠ(η) whose letters are edges in G.) Though the
cycle c(η) constructed in [17, Lemma 2.2] may depend on the chosen hyperbolic
structure on S, it is well-deﬁned as a cycle of G embedded on S, so we may now
alter the hyperbolic structure at will.

Figure 2. The curve γ and the associated cycle c(γ)

In what follows, we will construct a hyperbolic metric on S and bound the length
of the corresponding geodesic γ by bounding a chosen representative: By cutting
c(γ) into pieces and using the combinatorics of the result to provide instructions
for the construction of a curve homotopic to c(γ), we will bound from above the
length of γ in terms of its self-intersection number.

Figure 3. We construct a seam point on each seam edge.

3.2. Deﬁnition of τ - and β- arcs and twisting numbers. When a convenient
hyperbolic structure on S is chosen, the cycle c(γ) can be broken into more man-
ageable pieces. In each pair of pants, there are three simple geodesics that connect
a boundary component to itself. Each of these three geodesics intersects a unique
seam edge orthogonally, and we refer below to this intersection point as a seam
point (Figure 3). The seam points cut the cycle c(γ) into arcs. When such an arc
crosses a pants cuﬀ, we call it a β-arc; otherwise it will be called a τ -arc. Note that
c(γ) is given by the union of the τ - and β- arcs. See Figure 4 for an illustration.

Figure 4. A τ -arc is on the left and a β-arc is on the right.

In this description, each τ - and β- arc acquires a twisting number. The twisting
number ti of τi is a positive integer, and the twisting number bi of βi can be any
integer. The twisting number is deﬁned as follows: each τ - and β- arc has a subarc
η, contained in a pants cuﬀ, given by the concatenation of some number of edges
of the graph G. If η is part of a τ -arc τi, then ti is the number of edges in η. For
instance, the twisting number of the τ -arc in Figure 4 is three.
If η is part of a β-arc βi, then the number of edges in η is the absolute value of
bi. The sign of bi is determined by a choice of orientation of S; the sign of bi is
given by the sense with which βi winds around the corresponding pants cuﬀ. For
example, the twisting number of the β-arc in Figure 4 is either +1 or -1, depending
on the orientation of S.

We note that it is possible to determine precisely the length of a τ - or β- arc
from the length of the pants curve and the twisting number, but coarser estimates
suﬃce in the proof of Theorem 1.4 (see Lemma 5.2). This will allow us to estimate
the length of c(γ) in terms of the twisting numbers of the τ - and β- arcs. In order to
relate the length of γ to its self-intersection and the lengths of the pants curves, we
will require a method of estimating twist numbers as a function of self-intersection.

4. Inequalities relating self-intersection and twisting numbers
In [17], a sequence of Dehn twists about curves in P are applied to S so that
the twisting numbers associated to c(γ) about each cuﬀ α in P are related to k.
Fix a cuﬀ α of P. Let the β-arcs of α be given by βα = {β1, . . . , βn} and let
the τ -arcs be given by τα = {τ1, . . . , τm}. The twisting coordinates are given by
b1, . . . , bn ∈ Z and t1, . . . , tm ∈ Z>0, and by relabelling if necessary, we assume that
b1 ≤ b2 ≤ . . . ≤ bn and t1 ≥ t2 ≥ . . . ≥ tm. Note that Lemma 3.1 implies that
n ≤ D

k. The following inequalities are obtained in [17]:

√

Lemma 4.1. There is a mapping class φ, which is an appropriate product of powers
of Dehn twists about the pants curves, and a constant C so that the τ - and β- arcs
of c(φ · γ) about each cuﬀ α satisfy the following relationships:

• The total number of τ - and β- arcs is bounded by a multiple of

√

k:

√

n + m ≤ C ·

k
• When n (cid:54)= 0 the sum of the bi’s satisﬁes:

• Regarding twisting numbers of β-arcs we have:

• Lastly, we have:

i>j

Note that the constant C depends only on the topology of S.
√

(cid:80) bi by a factor of 2n and Lemma 3.1 tells us that n ≤ D

k.

The second bullet is a consequence of the fact that a Dehn twist about α changes

The last three bullet points of Lemma 4.1 can be viewed as the contribution to
the self-intersection number of γ from the “intersection” between diﬀerent τ -arcs,
diﬀerent β-arcs, and between τ - and β- arcs, respectively, though complications
arise due to the ambiguity inherent to the cycle c(γ). We note that the ﬁxed pants
decomposition P is well suited for the curve φ · γ in the sense that the estimate in
Lemma 3.1 still holds.

The relevant facts from [17] for the proof of Lemma 4.1 are contained in Propo-
sition 3.1 and its proof. Speciﬁally, we direct the reader to Lemma 3.6, Claims
4.7 and 4.9, Remarks 5.9 and 5.11 and inequality (4.3.3) of that paper. We warn
the reader that there are small diﬀerences between the notation used here and in
[17]. In particular, in that work each of the τ - and β- arcs is contained in a pants
cuﬀ, whereas our τ - and β- arcs include arcs from seam points to pants cuﬀs. Note
that none of the inequalities in Lemma 4.1 are aﬀected by this discrepancy, and the
diﬀerences in terminology will no longer be relevant. We use our notation for the
sake of simplicity in the proof of Theorem 1.4.

We need one additional estimate not contained in [17].

Note that ρ is a metric in which (cid:96)ρ(γ) ≤ C3

so it is enough to ﬁnd a metric in which the length of φ·γ is bounded. For notational
convenience, in what follows we replace φ · γ with γ, so that in particular we now
have that the inequalities from Section 4 apply verbatim to γ. We will pick a
hyperbolic metric on S by choosing appropriate lengths for the pants curves, and
we bound the length of c(γ) in that metric using the twist parameters about each
α ∈ P. The inequalities in Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 will allow us to ﬁnish the proof.

k if and only if (cid:96)φ−1·ρ(φ·γ) ≤ C3

We record some evident hyperbolic geometry facts to aid in our analysis. The
curve formed by a component of the boundary of the L-neighborhood of a geodesic
of length (cid:96) has length (cid:96) cosh(L). We will call such a curve an equidistant curve.

Lemma 5.1. Suppose that the curves in the boundary of a pair of pants have length
at most C. Then the distance from a seam point to a neighboring equidistant curve
of length C is at most D, where D is a constant depending only on C.

Proof. The given distance is a continuous function of the lengths of the three geo-
(cid:3)
desic boundary components that extends continuously to [0, C]3.
Lemma 5.2. Suppose that the length of α is , and that  ≤ 1. Then the lengths
of the β-arcs satisfy:

The β-arc βi (when oriented) travels from the seam point on a seam edge neigh-
boring α to the equidistant curve of length 1, from the equidistant curve of length
1 to the geodesic representative of α, traverses |bi| edges of G, from the geodesic
representative of α to the equidistant curve of length 1, and ﬁnally from the equidis-
tant curve of length 1 to another seam point. The ﬁrst and last leg of this journey
can be done in O(1) length by Lemma 5.1, and the remainder has length less than
or equal to 2 log(2/) + |bi|/2. The length bound for βα follows.

An oriented τ -arc τj similarly travels from a seam point to the equidistant curve
of length 1, from the equidistant curve of length 1 to the geodesic representative
of α, traverses tj edges of G, and ﬁnishes similarly to the way it came. This
representative has length given by 2 log(2/) + tj/2 + O(1).
If tj/2 ≤ 1/ for some j, then there is a more eﬃcient representative of the
arc τj, homotopic to the arc τj relative to its seam endpoints, but which manages
to perform the ‘twisting’ of τj around α with length contribution O(1). More
precisely, consider the representative of τj that travels from the starting seam point
to the equidistant curve of length 1, from the equidistant curve of length 1 to the
equidistant curve of length 2/tj — note that 1 ≥ 2/tj ≥  as needed — and ﬁnishes
along a seam edge of G as it came. This representative has length bounded above
by 2 log(tj) + 1 + O(1).

On the other hand, if tj/2 ≥ 1/ then 2 log(2/) ≤ 2 log(tj) and we conclude

that g(x1, . . . , xn) = K satisfy

for some λ ∈ R. This implies that xj = λ/j for each j = 1, . . . , n and the restriction
on g implies that λ = K/n. This yields the value

f (x1, . . . , xn) = log

easily seen to be a maximum for f restricted to g = K. We use the estimate n! ≥

(cid:3)

and setting the derivative of this last expression equal to zero gives n = (cid:112)K/e.
This implies that f (x1, . . . , xn) ≤ 2(cid:112)K/e for all n, as desired.

topology of S, and that the geodesic pants cuﬀ α has length at least 1/
k. Since
γ is the union of τ - and β- arcs, we apply the above analysis one-by-one at each of
the pants cuﬀs. The desired bound on (cid:96)(γ) follows.

As for the lower bound on the injectivity radius, recall that the collar lemma
states that a simple closed curve of length l has an embedded tubular neighborhood
of width log(coth(l/2)). If c is any simple closed geodesic, it is either a cuﬀ of P, or

16

it must intersect at least one cuﬀ of P; thus either the desired lower bound follows

√

immediately or c has length at least log(coth(1/2
k)), which is larger than 1/
for all k ≥ 2. When k = 1, log(coth(1/2)) > 1/2; the theorem follows.

Finally, we address the case where S has cusps or non-compact ends.

In the
case of non-compact ﬂaring ends, simply cut oﬀ the open ends to obtain a compact
surface with totally geodesic boundary in place of each ﬂaring end. Let S(γ) denote
√
the compact hyperbolic surface for which γ admits the desired short representative,
and suppose S has h boundary components, labeled b1, ..., bh. Then given  < 1/
k
and A ⊆ {1, ..., h}, let S(γ),A denote the hyperbolic surface for which each non-
peripheral cuﬀ of P has the same length and twisting coordinate as on the original
surface S(γ), but so that we replace each of the boundary components whose indices
lie within A, with one of length . Then we claim that γ admits a representative
satisfying the desired length bound on S(γ),A as well. Indeed, if α is a peripheral
cuﬀ of P on S(γ),A, the contribution to (cid:96)(γ) from arcs entering the (appropriately
chosen) tubular neighborhood of α are all τ arcs. Thus, as above denoting these
arcs as τα we have

Hence, the ﬁrst summand is smaller than the corresponding one on S(γ), and the
second two summands are unaﬀected by the change. Thus, given δ > 0 small,
choose  suﬃciently small so that (cid:96)S(γ)(γ) is within δ of the surface obtained by
replacing with a cusp each of the boundary components with indices in A. Letting
δ → 0, the theorem follows for cusped surfaces as well.

5.1. Questions and further remarks. Given a particular curve (or family of
curves), the construction in our proof of Theorem 1.7 often grants enough ﬂexibility
to strengthen the conclusion. We elaborate:
Remark 5.4. Given any  > 0, there exists N = N (,S) so that for any curve γ
with i(γ, γ) ≤ k whose length is minimized in the -thick part of Teichm¨uller space,
there exists a cover of degree N · √
k to which γ lifts simply.
√

Remark 5.5. The proof of Theorem 1.4 gives a suﬃcient condition for γ to have
short length (i.e. on the order of
k) in the thick part of Teichmuller space, in
terms of the twisting numbers of its τ - and β- arcs:

Suppose that c(γ) has τ - and β- arcs with twisting numbers t1, . . . , tm and

b1, . . . , bm, respectively, and that there exists an O(k) function f so that

(cid:88)

(cid:88)|bi| ≤ f (k) .

Note that such a function always exists by Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2. Then the proof of

Question 5.6. Can an upper bound for the degree deg(γ) be made explicit as a
function of the twisting numbers of the τ - and β- arcs?

Remark 5.7. One method to produce curves to which Remark 5.4 applies is to use
‘random geodesics’ arising in Bonahon’s theory of geodesic currents [2]. Suppose S
is compact, and ﬁx a hyperbolic metric ρ on S. Apply the geodesic ﬂow for time T
to a random unit tangent vector, and close up the curve arbitrarily with an arc of
length bounded by the diameter of the surface. Bonahon’s theory implies that these
curves projectively limit to the Liouville current of (S, ρ), whose length function is
minimized at ρ ∈ T (S). Remark 5.4 implies that deg(γT ) is growing at most as the
square root of the self intersection. (Alternatively, note that by [10, Theorem 1],
γT is almost surely of self-intersection roughly T 2 and length roughly T , and the
Lipschitz map from (S, ρ) to (S, ρ0) implies that deg(γT ) is growing at most as the
square root of the self-intersection number).

Question 5.8. What can be said about lower bounds for deg(γT )? Is there almost
surely linear growth in T ?

Question 5.9. What can be said about the statistics of the ﬁnitely many inﬁma of
length functions of curves with self-intersection k? By [1, Cor. 1.4] and Corollary
1.3, each such inﬁmum is roughly between log k and

k. What is the average?
