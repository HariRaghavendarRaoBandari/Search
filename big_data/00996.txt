We propose a set of subradiant states which can be prepared and detected in a one-dimensional optical lattice.
We ﬁnd that the decay rates are highly dependent on the spatial phases we manipulate to imprint on the atomic
system, which gives systematic investigations of the subradiance in the ﬂuorescence experiments. The time
evolution of these states can have long decay time where hundred milliseconds of lifetime is predicted up to
one hundred atoms. They can also show decayed Rabi-like oscillations with a beating frequency determined
by the difference of cooperative Lamb shift in the subspace. Experimental requirements are also discussed for
practical implementation of the subradiant states. Our proposal provides a novel scheme for quantum storage
of photons in arrays of two-level atoms through the preparation and detection of subradiant states, which offer
opportunities for quantum information processing in optical lattices.

Introduction. Cooperative light-matter interactions [1] play
an important role in the aspects of correlated spontaneous
emissions, quantum entanglement [2], and preparation of ex-
otic quantum states [3–7]. Superradiance [8, 9] and associ-
ated cooperative Lamb shift (CLS) [10, 11] are examples that
demonstrate the collectivity in exchanging photons within an
atomic ensemble. Subradiance, on the other hand, is a less
aware collective effect complementary to the superradiance,
which spontaneously emits light in a rate lower than the natu-
ral one. Single-photon superradiance [12–14] and subradiance
are of great interests in that the dimensionality of the Hilbert
space is restricted to the order of the number of atoms N only,
thus simpliﬁes the dynamical couplings with each other.

Resonant dipole-dipole interaction [15, 16] is regarded to
initiate the superradiance with properties of directional emis-
sions in an enhanced spontaneous decay rate. Because of its
spatial dependence in the short range (∝ 1/r3) and the long
range (∝ 1/r), the decay behavior heavily depends on the den-
sity and geometry of the interacting medium, and additionally
excitation polarizations. Recent experiments demonstrated a
shorter timescale of the second-order correlation of two pho-
tons in the cascade atomic ensembles [17, 18], and a signiﬁ-
cant redshift of CLS in various atomic systems including the
embedded Fe atoms in the planar cavity [19], an atomic vapor
[20], an ionic atomic array [21], and a cold atomic ensem-
ble [22]. Subradiant lifetime was also recently measured in
the ring plasmonic nanocavities [23], the ultracold molecules
[24], and a cold atomic ensemble [25].

If the excitation ﬁeld is weak or even a single photon is
driving a two-level atomic system (|gi and |ei for the ground
and excited sates respectively), the superradiance and accom-
panied CLS [11, 26] emerge from the symmetrical and singly-
excited state or timed Dicke state [12],

where k is the wavevector of the excitation pulse of a single
photon, and the tensor product denotes the rest of (N − 1)

ground state atoms other than the one being excited, that is
|eiµ|gi⊗(N −1) ≡ |ψµi. Since the symmetrical state is approx-
imately decoupled from the rest of (N − 1) orthogonal and
nonsymmetrical (NS) states {|φm6=Ni}, the emission long af-
ter the superradiance (afterglow if there is any because of
extremely low probability in the limit of extended medium)
suggests the occupation of the these states [14]. These NS
states responsible of the spontaneous emission in a rate lower
than the natural decay one are subradiant states, which were
observed in a large cloud of cold atoms [25]. A recent pro-
posal also suggested to preparation and detection of subradi-
ant states in the scheme based on subensembles [27].

A complete Hilbert space for a single photon interacting
with the atomic ensemble has been proposed for these nor-
malized NS states [14],

|φmi =

δµN − δµm(cid:17)eik·rµ|ψµi, (2)
for m ∈ [1 , N − 1] with C ≡ (1 + 1/√N )/(N − 1). An

alternative construction of the complete space is proposed in
terms of Dicke’s states where the formalism of singlet and
triplet states in the angular momentum eigenstates provides
the foundation to construct the Hilbert space [28],

µ=1 eik·rµ|ψµi − meik·rm+1|ψm+1i

The difference of the above two NS states is that the ﬁrst in-
volves all the atoms whereas the second involves a subset of
atoms in speciﬁc positions. In the perspective of experimental
preparation of these NS states, both require exquisite control
on the coefﬁcients of each constituent atoms, including the
amplitudes and phases, in order to evolve from the initially
prepared |φNi state to the targeted NS states. Similarly in the
setting of spatially-separated subensembles [27], intentional
preparation of speciﬁc subradiant state can be feasible by con-
trolling the phases of each subensembles though it would be
more difﬁcult technically for more subensembles.

The issue with these analytic NS states is that they are not
the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, and therefore each NS
state cannot be assessed individually in a controllable way.
Below we propose a complete space that involves all the atoms
collectively and can be deterministically prepared in the one-
dimensional (1D) optical lattice (OL) with one atom per site.
Moreover they are excited with equal probabilities, which thus
simpliﬁes the state preparation.

De Moivre states. We exploit De Moivre’s formula which
is originally used for the nth root of unity, that is for a com-
plex number z such that zn = 1. To construct the complete
N states for single-photon excitation, we take the roots of zN
= 1 as indication of the state coefﬁcients, which are ei2πm/N
for m ∈ [1 , N ]. Another useful identity of the sum of all
roots, SR(n) = 0 for all n except for n = 1, indicates the or-
thogonality of the De Moivre (DM) states we propose in the
below. We construct the complete Hilbert space including the
symmetrical state |φNi [29, 30],

where the normalization is ensured, and the orthogonality is
N (µ−1)(m−n)/N = δm,n. The phases of
the atomic chain in the 1D OL increase discretely and lin-
early while the amplitudes of the coefﬁcients are equal in
this Hilbert space. The DM states are quite different from the
aforementioned NS states where their amplitudes of the co-
efﬁcients need to be speciﬁcally constructed. They also re-
mind us of the discrete Fourier transform that their coefﬁ-
cients are exactly the Fourier series bases since the coefﬁcients
ei2πm(µ−1)/N are N -periodic. We denote the DM states as co-
operative ones in order to study the cooperative spontaneous
emissions induced by the long-ranged dipole-dipole interac-
tion, and they can be prepared in a collective way by the ex-
ternal ﬁeld gradient.

Experimental realizations. We propose to use a magnetic
ﬁeld gradient to introduce the linearly increasing phases along
the 1D OL shown in Fig. 1. The system can be ﬁrst prepared
in |φNi by absorbing a single photon. Then the gradient Zee-
man ﬁeld is turned on to evolve |φNi adiabatically to |φm6=Ni.
This evolution can be described by a unitary transformation ˆT
≡ eiVB τB , where the interaction energy VB = −µ· B, and τB
is the interaction time. After the evolution the spatial phases
of VBτB = mF gF µBBτB are imprinted on the atoms in the
mF Zeeman sublevel of the F hyperﬁne state. Here gF is the
Land´e g factor, µB is the Bohr magneton, B′ is ﬁeld gradi-
ent, and z represents the positions of the atoms. The measure-
ment of ﬂuorescence afterwards veriﬁes the state we prepare,
which therefore provides a systematic study of the super- or
sub-radiance of the cooperative single-photon DM states. The
subradiant state can be made to store light quanta for much
longer time, therefore is potentially useful for quantum mem-
ory of light [31].

We use the D2 transition of 87Rb atoms as an example, and
we choose the ground and excited states as |52S1/2, F = 2,

mF = −3i with gF = 2/3), respectively. The required phase
difference for neighboring sites is 2mπ/N for the mth DM
states, with m = 1, 2, ..., N . Thus to access whole Hilbert
space of DM states, this phase difference could be as large
B) in unit
as 2π. Therefore B′ should be as large as 0.92/(d′
sτ ′
of [mG/µm], with the dimensionless pulse duration τ ′
B in mil-
s in λ which is 780 nm for
liseconds and the lattice spacing d′
the D2 transition. For the order of d′
s = 1 we consider here, the
ﬁeld gradient would be around 92 mG/µm for 10 microsec-
onds of interaction time, which is within reach of typical ex-
periments. In the perspective of preparing a speciﬁc mth DM
state, a longer atomic chain of larger N also requires a less
ﬁeld gradient or a shorter interaction time to imprint the phase
gradients across the whole chain. For example of N = 500
we will demonstrate later, the ﬁeld gradient just requires 1.8
mG/µm or the interaction time becomes 200 nanoseconds to
prepare m = 10 DM state which still has a reduction of de-
cay rate in the order of 10−2Γ. An issue of QMP in Fig. 1(c),
however, is the lack of efﬁciency due to the creation of the su-
perradiant state in the beginning of the DM state preparation,
which decays faster than the free space decay rate (∼ 26 ns).
To get around this, we can utilize linear Stark shift to imprint
the required phases in a rate of MHz to restore the efﬁciency
in QMP.

The technique of position-dependent phase imprinting [32]
remind us of controlled reversible inhomogeneous broaden-

light in two-level atoms of praseodymium dopants in yttrium
orthosilicate (Pr3+:Y2SiO5) [33, 34] or warm Λ-type rubid-
ium vapour [35]. On the contrary, we apply the spatial phases
to the atoms to manipulate and control the DM states, rather
than for the purpose of creating inhomogeneous broadenings
on the excited states for efﬁcient absorption of light. Readout
process in the proposed protocols is straightforward that the
speciﬁcally prepared DM states are made to evolve back to
|φNi, which is a superradiant readout.
Time evolution of DM states. To investigate what exactly
DM states assess the signiﬁcantly small subradiant eigenval-
ues and what is the optimal lattice spacing for the lowest
eigenvalues, we ﬁrst study the coupling strength of the res-
onant dipole-dipole interaction in the DM state bases. Using
linear polarization of light propagating along the OL (that is ˆd
⊥ ˆrµν), we deﬁne the coupling strength as

φm(cid:29)(cid:21),

Mµν(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where Mµν ≡ Γ
2 (−Fµν + i2Gµνδν6=µ), and Fµν, Gµν are
decay rates and energy shifts from the resonant dipole-dipole
interaction between any pair of atoms (see Supplemental Ma-
terials [36] for deﬁnitions). In Fig. 2 we show the coupling
strengths for the DM states, and ﬁnd that small coupling
strengths mostly lie at small lattice spacings less than 0.4λ.
The period of λ/2 in ds for the coupling strengths is due
to the sinusoidal functions in the dipole-dipole interaction,
which is equivalent to a period of π. Similar periodic coupling
strengths are demonstrated in inﬁnite atomic lattices with a
period of 2π [37]. The coupling strengths saturate quickly as
N increases, therefore here we show for the case of N =
16 without loss of generality. Large coupling strengths can
be also seen in the inset, showing continuously shifted local
peaks from small to large m states due to equidistant change
of m. From the coupling strength calculations, we later choose
speciﬁcally ds = 0.1 and 0.25λ that correspond to the lowest

coupling strengths for the DM states of m = 6 and 4 respec-
tively. These speciﬁc DM states will be shown later to demon-
strate the smallest decay rate (longest lifetime) respectively.

Next we investigate the time evolution of the DM states
which can be observable in the ﬂuorescence experiments.
Since the resonant dipole-dipole interaction is long ranged,
there is no exact analytical form of the eigenstates in a ﬁnite
1D OL. Therefore the DM states we prepare in the 1D OL
would couple with several eigenstates that we numerically de-
rived. In Fig. 3 we show the normalized weightings deﬁned
in Supplemental Materials [36] for DM states. The weight-
ings demonstrate how signiﬁcant the eigenvalues λn govern
the time evolution for the DM states, and they are quite lo-
calized in general within two or three eigenstates. This means
that the DM states we manipulate to prepare make up an al-
most closed subspace in the whole eigenbases. For example
in (a), we can see that m = 2 and 11 form a closed subspace
of n = 9 and 10 with 98% weightings in the total eigenbases.
This reﬂects that our DM states simulate a decayed Rabi os-
cillation with a beating frequency of the difference of CLS in
the subspace. For a small lattice spacing as ds = 0.1λ, we
clearly see the separated groups of subradiant and superradi-
ant eigenvalues in the ascending order. Speciﬁcally for ds =
0.25λ in (b), more superradiant ones are lying closer to λn
= Γ/2 showing less enhanced decay rates due to the larger
lattice spacing. For even larger ds, we have more eigenvalues
distributing near Γ/2 as expected for the system approaching
the limit of independent atoms.

In Fig. 4, we show the time evolution of the DM state prob-
abilities speciﬁcally for m = 2 and 6, and compare with the
case of the independent atoms (∝ e−Γt). The DM state of m
= 2 shows Rabi-like oscillation, which forms a subspace with
the DM state of m = 11. The beating frequency in the plot is
estimated as 0.863Γ, which has less than 1.2% relative error
compared to 0.853Γ, the difference of CLS in the subspace of

FIG. 4. (Color online) Time evolutions of cooperative single-photon
subradiant state probabilities. For N = 16 and ds = 0.1λ, we demon-
strate the time evolutions of DM states of m = 2 (◦, oscillatory and
subradiant), m = 6 (inset, oscillatory and subradiant), and m = 16
(⋄, superradiant), compared to the natural decay one e−Γt (dash).

n = 9 and 10. In this way the DM states provide a systematic
measurement of reletive CLS from the ﬂuorescence experi-
ments. The symmetric DM state |φNi with m = 16 shows
superradiance as expected, which however involves several
superradiant eigenmodes as seen in Fig. 3(a). The most in-
teresting and important observation is for the DM state of m
= 6 where we plot the envelopes of the long-time emission in-
tensity. This DM state is mostly comprised of two eigenmodes
with the lowest real parts of the two eigenvalues (5.1 × 10−4
and 1.3 × 10−3Γ) with 99% weightings among all. To deter-
mine the lowest decaying rate of the subradiant DM states, we
use an exponential ﬁt of e−Γf t to the emission envelopes for
different number of atoms and lattice spacings in Fig. 5. We
show as low as the order of 10−7Γ decay rate for the DM state
of 100 atoms, which is equivalent to the lifetime of several
hundred milliseconds in the system of two-level atoms. When
ds & 0.5λ as shown in the inset, the decay constant barely
depends on the atom numbers. The parenthesis shows the spe-
ciﬁc mth DM state that occupies the most of the eigenmodes
with the lowest real part of the eigenvalue, which scales with
atom numbers. The cases of the lattice spacings at 0.5 and 1λ
sharing the same DM states again reﬂects the period of λ/2 in
the coupling strengths. For even longer 1D chains, the lifetime
can be longer and seems to reach indeﬁnitely to the zero decay
for ds shorter than 0.4λ, although it is more challenging for
the experiments in the perspectives of stability and controlla-
bility. Also the ﬁdelity of preparing the genuine DM states for
longer 1D chains would suffer from the unwanted inhomoge-
neous broadenings by the magnetic ﬁeld gradient.

Our proposal for the DM states implemented in a 1D OL
can potentially be realized in 1D hard core bosons [38, 39],
ions [21], color center defects in diamond [40, 41], or atom-
ﬁber system [42]. With a scalable 1D array, decoherence-free
regime can be feasible, which adds the richness and robustness
to quantum information network. Our setting is also alterna-
tive to investigating the many-body long-range interactions in
the alkaline-earth-metal atoms [43] and the cooperative be-
havior in the square and kagome lattices [44]. For prepara-

the cases of ds = 0.25 and 0.5λ for demonstration. The error bar

tion of the single-photon subradiant states, a scheme with
Rydberg atomic excitations [45, 46] is sufﬁcient to generate
singly-excited cooperative states via dipole blockade effects
along with phase imprinting. We expect even richer dynam-
ical couplings between atoms by introducing this additional
long-ranged dipole-dipole interactions.

In conclusion, we propose a complete Hilbert space of co-
operative single-photon states that can be prepared and ma-
nipulated in the two-level atoms in a 1D OL. Speciﬁcally
these cooperative subradiant states can be systematically stud-
ied by varying the spatially-dependent phases we imprint on
the atoms by Zeeman ﬁeld gradient. Cooperative Lamb shift
can be also studied in our setting and measured from ﬂuores-
cence experiments. Hundred milliseconds of lifetime can be
observable in several tens of atoms, serving a potentially ro-
bust quantum memory of light.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS FOR COOPERATIVE

SINGLE-PHOTON SUBRADIANT STATES

RESONANT DIPOLE-DIPOLE INTERACTION

The theoretical analysis is based on the Hamiltonian (VI) of
a quantized radiation ﬁeld interacting with a two-level atomic
ensemble of N atoms. In interaction picture we have ( = 1)

VI = −

Xµ=1Xk,λ

and the dipole operator is deﬁned as
ˆSµ ≡ ˆσµe−iωeg t + ˆσ†

(7)
where the lowering operator is ˆσµ ≡ |giµhe| with the transi-
tion frequency ωeg = ωe − ωg. The coupling coefﬁcient is gk
≡ (g|| ˆd||e)E(k) where the double matrix element of the dipole
moment ˆd is independent of the hyperﬁne structure, and E(k)
= pkc/(2ǫ0V ) with the quantization volume V . Photon po-
larization is ǫk,λ, and the unit direction of the dipole operator
is ˆd. The bosonic photon operators satisfy the commutation
relation [ˆak,λ, ˆa†
k′,λ′] = δk,k′δλ,λ′. We use the dipole approx-
imation for the Hamiltonian, and keep the counter rotating-
wave parts to correctly account for the energy shift of the res-
onant dipole-dipole interaction in the below.

Solving Heisenberg equations of motion from the above
Hamiltonian, we derive the effective coupled equations for ar-
bitrary atomic operators ˆQ in a Lindblad form that

action induced by the common light-matter interaction. Fµν

and Gµν are spatially-dependent decay rates and cooperative
Lamb shifts respectively, where Fµν approaches 1 as ξ → 0
while Gµν becomes divergent. The divergence means the
inaccuracy of the quantum optical treatment in such small
scale since the atom’s internal structure is not accounted for.

TIME EVOLUTION OF DE MOIVRE STATES

To investigate the time evolution of De Moivre (DM) states,
we turn to the Schr¨odinger equations projected from the above
Lindblad form. First we derive the time evolution of the
singly-excited states |ψµi by projecting the coherence opera-
tors ˆQ = |ψµihg|⊗N on |gi⊗N . Deﬁne the state of the system
in Schr¨odinger picture as |Ψ(t)i = PN
µ=1 cµ(t)|ψµi, we have

˙cµ(t) =

N

Xν=1

Mµνcν(t),

(11)

2 (−Fµν + i2Gµνδν6=µ), forming a matrix ˆM
where Mµν ≡ Γ
involving dynamical couplings between any pair of atoms. Us-
ing the similarity transformation, we can diagonalize ˆM with
the eigenvalues λl and eigenvectors ˆU , such that

cµ(t) = Xν,n

UµneλntU −1

nν cν(t = 0),

(12)

where cν(t = 0) denotes the initial condition of the system.
When we prepare the atoms in one of the DM states |φmi, the
state vector |Ψ(t)i can be expressed as PN
m′=1 dm′(t)|φm′i,
which starts to evolve initially from some DM state, that is
dm′ (t = 0) = δm′m. Using the relation of dm = PN
cµe−ik·rµ−i2mπ(µ−1)/N /√N , eventually we derive the time
evolution of the DM states,

µ=1

dm(t) =

We note that vn(m) is the inner product of mth DM state and
nth eigenvector in ˆU, in which |vn(m)|2 shows how close
DM states are to the eigen ones. We also deﬁne a normal-
ized weighting of |vn(m)wn(m)|2 to describe the portion of
speciﬁc λn that governs the time evolution of the DM states.
