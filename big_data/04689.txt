Abstract. We give a pedagogical introduction to the methodology of the Quench
Action, which is an eﬀective representation for the calculation of time-dependent
expectation values of physical operators following a generic out-of-equilibrium state
preparation protocol (for example a quantum quench). The representation, originally
introduced in [1], is founded on a mixture of exact data for overlaps together with
variational reasonings. It is argued to be quite generally valid and thermodynamically
exact for arbitrary times after the quench (from short times all the way up to the
steady state), and applicable to a wide class of physically relevant observables. Here,
we introduce the method and its language, give an overview of some recent results,
suggest a roadmap and oﬀer some perspectives on possible future research directions.

interest in the study of relaxation in isolated
There has recently been a lot of
many-body quantum systems (see [2–5] and references therein), fuelled in no small
part by experimental studies of out-of-equilibrium situations using cold atoms [6–14].
Theoretically, the problem boils down to considering a generic initial state, which we
assume to be a pure state represented by a wavefunction |Ψ(t = 0)i, evolving unitarily
in time according to a Hamiltonian H,
|Ψ(t)i = e−iHt|Ψ(t = 0)i,

(1)
where |Ψ(t = 0)i is not a simple (e.g. ﬁnite, zero entropy in the thermodynamic limit)
linear combination of eigenstates of H. Such initial states can be constructed (among
other ways) by performing a sudden quantum quench [15], i.e. preparing the initial
state as an eigenstate of a certain Hamiltonian H< but suddenly changing the latter to
H from t = 0 onwards.

For many reasons, the one-dimensional case turns out to be of particular interest,
among others due to the existence of exact methods (often resting on the property of
integrability) allowing to perform nonperturbative computations. One of the central
developments of recent years has been the realization that time evolution under an
integrable H must be viewed as sitting in a diﬀerent class as compared to the non-
integrable case.
In the absence of integrability, relaxation to a thermal ensemble is
expected to occur; instead, for the integrable case, thermalization should not occur, and
the expectation values of operators long after the quench are expected to be described
by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) [16], taking not only the energy conservation
constraint but also those associated to all other available conserved charges into account.
Despite its appeal, the main drawback of the GGE is its limitation to the description
of long-time averages only. The description of the whole time evolution, from small to
large times, is however desirable for quantitative experimental phenomenology, in which
the long time limit can be diﬃcult to reach. In any case, the time evolution process is
itself extremely interesting to study, since it encodes how quantum interference eﬀects
can eventually drive this out-of-equilibrium initial state to a well-deﬁned steady state.
Our main focus will be the calculation of post-quench time-dependent expectation

values of generic (combinations of) physical operators O,

This problem is particularly diﬃcult not only because the time evolution of the state
itself is highly nontrivial, but also because the operators O one is typically interested in
create a complicated web of excitations when acting on a given state.

A new take on this problem,

inspired by the generic usefulness of variational
reasonings in physics, was recently proposed in [1], allowing to transform (2) into a
much more eﬃcient and (in principle) easily implementable representation, valid for
situations in which energy and higher charge ﬂuctuations around the steady state

become small in the thermodynamic limit. The approach is based on the deﬁnition
of an appropriate measure in Hilbert space, the Quench Action, aiming at quantifying
the relative importance of eigenstates in the time evolution. The approach has a
number of beneﬁts:
it can, as the discussed examples demonstrate, be implemented
exactly in the thermodynamic limit for quenches to nontrivially-interacting theories,
and most importantly it oﬀers a very clear path towards the calculation of the actual
time dependence of observables, and not just on the theoretically most easily accessible,
but experimentally much less easily obtainable steady state. The method thus invites
further applications with a slight change of focus away from the t → ∞ limit and
towards ﬁnite time scales which anyway carry even richer physics.

The paper is organized as follows. We start in section 2 by recalling important
features of integrable Hamiltonians, and deﬁning some useful notations. The approach
towards the thermodynamic limit is then presented, with a discussion of a handy
implementation of the resolution of the identity for the problem at hand, followed by
a summary of important notions of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz.
In section 3, the
Quench Action formalism is then introduced for the study of a generic quench problem,
keeping a focus on the calculation of time-dependent expectation values, for which a
greatly simpliﬁed representation is given. Section 4 presents a quick summary of recently
worked-out solutions to quench problems using the method. This is followed in section
5 by some perspectives on the general problem of computing overlaps between initial
states and exact eigenstates, these overlaps being the fundamental building blocks on
which the method is based, and with some further perspectives on potential further
developments.

2. Fundamentals

Let us begin by deﬁning the language and notations we will use later on.

2.1. Bethe states

Upon quantization, the eigenstates of a Bethe Ansatz-solvable model
[17–20] are
uniquely labeled by a set of quantum numbers {I}. For simplicity, we consider a
model in which only one type of particle is present (the generalization to cases where
multiple types of string states are possible, e.g. for spin chains (see discussion around
equation (115)), is completely straightforward, in which case the quantum numbers carry
a ‘particle type’ index. If the model is in the continuum, the possible quantum numbers
are unbounded; on the lattice, they obtain type-speciﬁc limits; we do not specify these
model-dependent details at this stage. A resolution of the identity operator in Fock

space can then be formally written as‡

(3)

in which the summation over N (the number of particles) runs over all allowed values.
We use the bra-ket notation for eigenstates, namely |{I}Ni represents the normalized
N-particle Bethe Ansatz state

where L is the system size in dimensionless units and θkin and θscat are model-dependent
kinetic and scattering kernels. In (4), N ({I}N ) is the state normalization factor obtained
from the appropriate Gaudin determinant. For deﬁniteness, in (4), we have explicitly
written each rapidity as being a function of the whole set of quantum numbers. This
fact, which the reader should not forget, will be kept implicit in the following.

2.2. The thermodynamic limit: root distributions and root densities

The general idea behind the thermodynamic limit is (as far as individual states are
concerned) to replace sets of rapidities by distribution functions, and (and as far as
state ensembles are concerned) to express the summations over eigenstates by a form
of functional integration, with an eye towards the obtention of analytical results. The
ﬁrst step in this direction is to think of the quantum numbers scaled by the system size
Ij/L in terms of a real variable x taking values on the real line. We associate to each
eigenstate a root distribution ρdist with support on the real axis

|{I}i ⇔ ρdist(x;{I}),

this distribution in x space being deﬁned as

ρdist(x;{I}) =

δ(x − xj),

xj ≡

Ij
L

.

LXj

Of course, the particular system being studied might be such that the interval of support
of x is bounded; in all cases however these bounds are state-independent and their
presence does not aﬀect the reasonings presented here.

It is important to remember that ρdist carries the complete characteristics of a
given eigenstate, and is therefore (implicitly) labeled by the set {I}. Note also that it

is not a continuously diﬀerentiable function of x, but rather a distribution visualized as
an unevenly-spaced but equal-height delta comb deﬁned by the quantum numbers. It
exactly (to all orders in 1/L) obeys the identities

ˆ dxρdist(x;{I}N )f (x) =

L

f (xj) (8)

N

Xj=1

in which the integral is taken over the whole support of ρ(x) and f (x) is any continuous
function.

The thermodynamic limit, denoted limT h in the following,

is deﬁned as the
simultaneous limits L → ∞, N → ∞ with N/L ﬁxed. For later purposes, we will also
consider a more ﬂexible viewpoint here and split the space of quantum numbers into
L = 0 and limT h li = +∞
‘boxes’ (labeled by an integer i) of size li chosen such that limT h
∀i, giving us a ‘box regularized’ thermodynamic limit which we will denote by limT h,reg.
For a given eigenstate, within box i, there will be a positive integer number ni of

li

occupied quantum numbers, allowing to deﬁne an average density ρi in box i as

ρi =

ni
li

,

with

0 ≤ ρi ≤ 1 ∀i.

(9)

The speciﬁcation of the box ﬁllings ρi does not label eigenstates uniquely. In order to
do so, we also need to specify the particular conﬁguration of quantum numbers within

all boxes. Assuming that ci (which is an index running over (cid:0) li
ni (cid:1) values) labels such
a conﬁguration in box i, we can thus uniquely label an eigenstate for a given box
regularization by its set of density and in-box conﬁguration labels, |{I}i ≡ |{ρi};{ci}i,
the resolution of the identity becoming

1 =X{I}

|{I}ih{I}| =X{ρi}X{ci}

|{ρi};{ci}ih{ρi};{ci}|.

(10)

In the Hilbert space, for a given box regularization, there will be many states with

(11)

the same set of box densities {ρi}. This number is simply

1|ﬁxed {ρi}

X{ci}

=Yi   li

ni ! ≡ eSY Y

{ρi}

whose logarithm has a leading extensive term which is the well-known Yang-Yang
entropy [21].

Within the set of states at ﬁxed {ρi}, there exists one with a ‘maximally ﬂat’
conﬁguration where, in all boxes i, the ni occupied quantum numbers are distributed
uniformly over the li available spaces§. We will label this as {ci} = {0}. We can then
write

ρdist(x;{I}) = ρdist(x;{ρi};{ci}) = ρ(x;{ρi}) + ρib(x;{ρi};{ci})

(12)

where

ρ(x;{ρi}) ≡ ρdist(x;{ρi};{0}),
ρib(x;{ρi};{ci}) ≡ ρdist(x;{ρi};{ci}) − ρ(x;{ρi})

(13)

§ The precise details obviously don’t really matter here.

respectively represent the ‘maximally ﬂat’ part of the distribution, and its in-box
microscopic features. In the regularized thermodynamic limit, we can eﬀectively make
the replacements

lim
T h,reg

ρ(x;{ρi}) = ρsm(x) ∈ C∞,

lim
T h,reg

ρib(x;{ρi};{ci}) = 0

(14)

as far as any in-box-conﬁguration insensitive quantity is concerned, in the sense that
given a continuously diﬀerentiable function f (x), we have

lim

T h,regˆ dxρ(x;{ρi})f (x) = ˆ dxρsm(x)f (x),
T h,regˆ dxρib(x;{ρi};{ci})f (x) = 0.

lim

(15)

The smooth, diﬀerentiable function ρsm(x) will be called the root density in order to
distinguish it from the neither smooth nor diﬀerentiable distribution ρdist. Another
convenient function to introduce is the hole density function, which is the complement
of ρdist in the space of quantum numbers, and the total density ρt = ρ+ρh whose smooth
version coincides with unity,

sm(x) = ρsm(x) + ρh
ρt

sm(x) = 1.

(16)

The notations up to now have involved integrations over quantum number space. It
is customary to also express integrals in rapidity space, extending the Bethe equations
(5) to the functional equation

θkin(λ) +ˆ dλ′ θscat(λ − λ′)ρsm(λ′) = 2π x(λ)

(17)

where the function x(λ) is now viewed as labelling the state. This function then deﬁnes
a mapping between the quantum number and rapidity spaces. The transformation rule
of δ functions then allows to write the densities directly in rapidity space,

ρsm(λ) = ρsm(x(λ))

dx(λ)

dλ

,

ρt
sm(λ) =

dx(λ)

dλ

.

(18)

A technical aspect to bear in mind is that the distributions so deﬁned are not made of
equal-height delta functions, but rather of state-dependent heights, which are implicit
functions of the interaction-induced backﬂows when moving rapidities around. The
quantum numbers are the truly statistically-independent parameters from which the
trace over states should be deﬁned.

2.3. Rudiments of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz

For completeness, we recall a few basic notions of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz which are
useful for the discussions here. Readers looking for a more systematic introduction to
the subject should consult [18] and references therein.

At the center of the ABA is the notion of the R-matrix, which is a matrix deﬁned
in the tensor product of two auxiliary spaces A1⊗A2, obeying the Yang-Baxter relation
(19)

R12(λ, µ)R13(λ, ν)R23(µ, ν) = R23(µ, ν)R13(λ, ν)R12(λ, µ).

CONTENTS

8

One then introduces a monodromy matrix T (λ) living in the tensor product of auxiliary
and Hilbert spaces and depending on a (in general complex-valued) spectral parameter
λ, and obeying the intertwining relation

R12(λ, µ)T1(λ)T2(µ) = T2(µ)T1(λ)R12(λ, µ).

(20)

In the simplest cases, the auxiliary space is two-dimensional and the monodromy matrix
is represented as

T (λ) ≡  A(λ) B(λ)
C(λ) D(λ) !

(21)

in which A(λ), B(λ), C(λ), D(λ) are operators acting in Hilbert space. The transfer
matrix τ , deﬁned as the trace (in auxiliary space) of the monodromy matrix (the second
equality here is special to the case of two-dimensional auxiliary space)

τ (λ) = TrAT (λ) = A(λ) + D(λ)

(22)

then has the fundamental property of self-commutation at arbitrarily chosen spectral
parameters,

[τ (λ), τ (µ)] = 0, ∀ λ, µ ∈ C.

(23)

This naturally allows to build a set of commuting quantum charges from so-called trace
identities

Qn ∝

dn
dλn ln τ (λ)|λ=ξ

(24)

in which the constant prefactors can be chosen at leisure.

All fundamental commutation relations of the model are contained in the algebra
of monodromy matrix operators A, B, C, D issuing from (20) once an R-matrix and
a monodromy matrix have been deﬁned. The algebra is quadratic in operators. For
example, the simplest nontrivial structure for an R-matrix takes the shape

where the functions a(λ) and d(λ) can be chosen arbitrarily (they should be viewed as

(31)

for generic M and {λj}M . Note the very important fact that the order in the product
is immaterial, in view of the commutation relation (27). So written, the states are also
not normalized. Again using the monodromy matrix element commutation relations,
one can show that these states are eigenstates of the transfer matrix (22) provided the
set of rapidities {λ} obeys the Bethe equations

and ϕ is a model-dependent scalar function. The importance of Slavnov’s theorem
cannot be overemphasized, since it allows for the computation of matrix elements in
integrable models once the solution to the ‘quantum inverse problem’ (the mapping of
physical operators to monodromy matrix operators) is known.

CONTENTS

10

The norm of an eigenstate can similarly be computed algebraically using the
commutation relations between monodromy matrix entries, or as the appropriate limit
of Slavnov’s theorem, yielding the celebrated Gaudin formula [17, 23, 24].

3. The Quench Action formalism

Having introduced some of the concepts and notations we shall make use of, we will in
this section oﬀer a general description of the formalism of the Quench Action, outlining
the overall logic and describing the generic conditions for its applicability.

3.1. The Quench Action and its saddle point

Let us go back to our original problem and consider an arbitrary wavefunction at t = 0.
We assume that from this instant onwards, the time evolution occurs according to the
Bethe Ansatz-solvable Hamiltonian H whose normalized eigenstates are labeled by sets
of quantum numbers {I}. The initial state is exactly decomposed in the basis of these
eigenstates according to

|Ψ(t = 0)i =X{I}

e−SΨ

{I}|{I}i

where we have deﬁned the overlap coeﬃcients
= − lnh{I}|Ψ(t = 0)i ∈ C.

SΨ
{I}

(38)

(39)

One crucial property is that since we are working with normalized states, the real parts
of the overlap coeﬃcients are bounded from below,
{I} ≥ Smin ∀{I}

∃ Smin ∈ R ≥ 0 | ℜSΨ

(40)

and tend to inﬁnity for states with vanishing overlap.

In the eigenbasis,

the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is now trivially
solved by using H|{I}i = ω{I}|{I}i, allowing us to write the exact time-dependent
wavefunction as

|Ψ(t)i =X{I}

e−SΨ

{I}−iω{I}t|{I}i.

(41)

The expectation value (2) which we are centrally interested in can then of course be
written, without any approximation, as a double Hilbert space-sized summation

¯O(t) = P{I l}P{I r}

e−(SΨ

{Il }

)∗−SΨ

{Ir }+i(ω{Il}−ω{Ir })th{I l}|O|{I r}i
e−2ℜSΨ
P{I}

{I}

.

(42)

Such a double summation is in general too diﬃcult to perform due to the exceedingly
large number of terms it contains. Our aim here is to show that in the thermodynamic
limit, under mild assumptions, this summation can be drastically simpliﬁed.

CONTENTS

11

Let us begin by looking at the denominator of (2) or (42), namely the (time-

independent) normalization of the initial state:

hΨ(t)|Ψ(t)i =X{I}

e−2ℜSΨ

{I}.

(43)

Using our resolution of the identity (10), we can write this (using a self-explanatory
notation) as

hΨ(t)|Ψ(t)i =X{ρi}X{ci}

e−2ℜSΨ

{ρi};{ci}.

(44)

If we are using normalized states at all steps, this summation is of course equal to
one. The detailed distribution of contributions is however not trivial, and the weight
distribution is utterly undemocratic. For a generic initial state, the overlaps can be
rapidly-varying numbers as we move around the Hilbert space. Modifying the quantum
number of a single particle even by the smallest allowable unit can for example change
the overlap by a factor of order one. In fact, the overlaps can even suddenly identically
vanish if some discrete symmetry requirement is violated. Assuming all such discrete
symmetries have been handled by a proper partitioning of the Hilbert spacek, the
remaining overlaps do not by any means have to be smooth functions of the state’s
quantum numbers. On the other hand, one can expect that the extensive part of the
logarithm of the overlaps is insensitive to the microscopic details of the state, and rather
depends only on the overall root distribution. To express this formally, for a given set
of box ﬁllings {ρi}, we can deﬁne an eﬀective box-averaged overlap according to

e−2ℜSΨ

{ρi};{ci}

(45)

e−So

{ρi} ≡ e−SY Y

{ρi}X{ci}

in which So
is a real-valued function of the ﬁllings {ρi}, representing the overlaps,
which becomes a well-deﬁned, diﬀerentiable functional of the smooth distribution ρsm
(14) in the thermodynamic limit,

{ρi}

lim
T h,reg

So
{ρi} ≡ So[ρsm].

(46)

The same smoothness in the thermodynamic limit is of course automatically true (and
traditionally tacitly assumed) of the Yang-Yang entropy,

lim
T h,reg

SY Y
{ρi} ≡ SY Y [ρsm].

(47)

Once the in-box summations have been performed in this way, the remaining
summation over box ﬁllings can be interpreted as a conventional functional integral
over continuously diﬀerentiable functions ρsm,

lim

T h,regX{ρi}

(...) = ˆρsm∈C∞

(since we are still working with distributions in quantum number space, where statistical
independence holds, there is no extra Jacobian in this functional

normalization summation (44) can be rewritten as

T h,reghΨ(t)|Ψ(t)i = ˆ Dρsm e−SQ[ρsm]

lim

(49)

where the ‘Quench Action’ functional is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the pseudo-
energy obtained from the overlaps and the Yang-Yang entropy of the state,

SQ[ρ] = So[ρ] − SY Y [ρ].

(50)

By construction, the Quench Action thus represents a sort of equivalent of a free energy
for out-of-equilibrium situations.
It is an extensive (any non-extensive part takes on
large positive values, and thus does not inﬂuence the expectation values considered),
real-valued functional which is bounded from below due to the state normalization
constraint. One of the appeals of the Quench Action approach is that it is amenable to
all the standard ﬁeld-theoretical methods we are accustomed to in (quantum) statistical
mechanics. This will be discussed in more detail later on in the perspectives.

As a ﬁrst step towards a more useful representation, let us apply a steepest-descent
reasoning in the evaluation of (49). Assuming that there exists a single minimum¶,
the functional integral (49) can be evaluated in a saddle-point approximation (the
applicability of the saddle-point logic resting on the system size going to inﬁnity),

where CL represent corrections vanishing in the thermodynamic limit, and T (λ, µ) =
is the functional Hessian of the Quench Action evaluated at the

(continuously diﬀerentiable) saddle-point distribution ρsp, which is determined as the
distribution that satisﬁes the generalized TBA (GTBA, see for example [26, 27])

δρ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ρsp

The Hessian (provided it doesn’t vanish) gives only subleading contributions in
the thermodynamic limit, and can be neglected if one focuses on the dominant
contributions only. Including subdominant terms is procedurally straightforward from
the construction above.

In practice, the equations derived from the saddle-point condition (52) are
morphologically identical to the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations one obtains
when treating ﬁnite-temperature equilibrium integrable models. In TBA (see [21], [19]
and references therein), one indeed performs a saddle-point analysis, which becomes
exact in the thermodynamic limit, the functional integral weight being simply the

manifolds slightly less so, although one can then follow inspirations from traditional statistical
mechanics.

(exponential of minus the) free energy of the system. The Quench Action (50) however
contains terms which depend on the density function ρ in ways distinct from the thermal
free energy, meaning that the ‘driving terms’ in equations (52) are distinct from the usual
TBA ones. Explicit examples of these will be given in the next section.

Now is a good time to discuss a subtle point: is the Quench Action (50) equivalent to
the GGE? The Quench Action is by construction a mathematically exact representation
of the diagonal ensemble; the GGE, when implemented correctly, converges to it in the

to ﬁnd a steady state, then these steady states must be the same.
In this sense,
equivalence is obvious. That said, the fact that the QA and the GGE share the
saddle point does not mean that beyond-saddle-point features must coincide. More
importantly, the point is that the QA and the GGE are founded on diﬀerent footholds,
meaning that approximations within one approach will not be expressible within the
language of the other. For example, approximating the GGE by truncating the set of
charges used has no meaningful equivalent within the QA approach. Conversely, a clever
approximation scheme for evaluating the extensive parts of the overlap logarithms has
no obvious translation to the language of conserved charges. Thus, though properly-
implemented and performed calculations within the QA and GGE schemes should agree
on the steady state, the two approaches remain quite distinct on the practical level. A
more fundamental diﬀerence between the approaches is however discussed in the next
subsection.

3.2. Time-dependent expectation values

Let us now tackle the more challenging (but physically rich and interesting) evaluation
of the numerator of (42),

hΨ(t)|O|Ψ(t)i =X{I l}X{I r}

e−(SΨ

{Il}

)∗−SΨ

{Ir }ei(ω{Il }−ω{Ir })th{I l}|O|{I r}i.

(53)

In the thermodynamic limit, we expect that only a minority of states signiﬁcantly
contribute to this double sum. A major simpliﬁcation comes from exploiting the fact
that for a typical physical operator O (local density, particle addition/removal, etc.),
the matrix elements h{I l}|O|{I r}i are rapidly-decreasing functions of the ‘diﬀerence’
between the bra and ket states, in other words of the number of displaced quantum
numbers from one state to the other. We will call the operator O a ‘weak’
operator if its matrix elements h{I l}|O|{I r}i are negligible unless {I l} = {I r} +
excitations carrying zero entropy. In other words, a weak operator O does not produce
ﬁnite-entropy modiﬁcations of the state it acts upon. An equivalent way of saying this
is that the linear decomposition

O|{I}i =Xe

o{I};e|{I}; ei,

o{I};e ∈ C

(54)

representing the action of O on a certain state can be truncated to a discrete, sub-
entropically large number of excitations as one approaches the thermodynamic limit,

while obeying all available sum rules to arbitrary accuracy. To put it quantitatively, let
us use the operator O’s normalized elements

to deﬁne a Shannon-like operator entropy

n{I};e ≡ o{I};e"Xe |o{I};e|2#−1/2
{I} ≡ −Xe (cid:0)|n{I};e|2 ln|n{I};e|2 + (1 − |n{I};e|2) ln(1 − |n{I};e|2)(cid:1) .

A weak operator is then an operator which has a subextensive operator entropy. Note
that this statement depends on both the operator and on the state on which it is
applied, and is moreover basis-dependent: the operator entropy is calculated in the
eigenstates basis (since we are interested in dephasings under time evolution).
It
implicitly depends on the correspondence between the structure of the constituents
of O (for example, O could be a simple sum of local operators) and the operators
corresponding to the creation of eigenstates (namely, products of B operators). If these
are similar, the operator entropy is low. One also generally expects a ﬁnite product
of weak operators to itself be weak. Note that multiple-point, time-split operator
insertions like ei(ta−tb)HOae−i(ta−tb)HOb representing dynamical correlations, are also
weak operators if Oa and Ob are weak.
hΨ(t)|O|Ψ(t)i =X{ρi}X{ci}Xe
×ei(ω{ρi};{ci}−ω{ρi};{ci};e)th{ρi};{ci}|O|{ρi};{ci}; ei.

Assuming that O is a weak operator, the numerator of (42) simpliﬁes to

{ρi};{ci};e ×

{ρi};{ci})∗−SΨ

e−(SΨ

To proceed further, we note that the thermodynamically ﬁnite energy diﬀerence between
the bra and ket states depends only on the discrete excitations and the smooth density
ρsm, but not on the in-box conﬁgurations {ci}. This is a very general and robust feature
of states in the thermodynamic limit. We will write
(ω{ρi};{ci};e − ω{ρi};{ci}) ≡ ωe[ρsm].

lim
T h,reg

(58)

(57)

Since the energy- and time-dependent phase can now be factorized out of the {ci}
conﬁguration sums, we can deﬁne box-averaged combinations of the overlaps and matrix
element products. To do this, we assume that the weak operator O we consider is such
that its matrix elements are invariant under a simultaneous shift of in-box conﬁgurations
in the bra and ket states, up to corrections which vanish in the thermodynamic limit.
We will then call the operator ‘smooth’. Symbolically, we can write that a smooth
operator O is such that

lim
T h,reg

h{ρi};{c′i}|O|{ρi};{c′i}; ei
h{ρi};{ci}|O|{ρi};{ci}; ei

= 1 + o(1)

∀ {ci},{c′i}.

(59)

Equivalently, a smooth operator O commutes with operators enforcing only in-box
modiﬁcations of the quantum numbers, up to terms vanishing in the regularized
thermodynamic limit. If we deﬁne in-box shuﬄing operators

P{ci}{c′

i} ≡ |{ci}ih{c′i}|,

the statement that operator O is smooth is equivalent to the vanishing of the
commutation of O with all
in-box shuﬄings, as far as all expectation values are
concerned,
h{ρi}|(cid:2)O, P{ci}{c′

(61)
The assumption that O is a weak, smooth operator allows us to considerably
simplify our equations by picking a particular in-box conﬁguration as a representative
and to take the matrix element out of the in-box conﬁguration sum, writing

i}(cid:3)|{ρi}i = o(1)

stage as the matrix element obtained in a arbitrary but ﬁxed regularization of ρsm
in terms of a box-regularized {ρi} and a ﬁxed choice of in-box conﬁgurations {ci},
for example h{ρi};{0}|O|{ρi};{0}; ei. These matrix elements are completely deﬁned
(exactly, irrespective of the interaction parameter, to all orders in inverse system size)
by their algebraic Bethe Ansatz representation (typically in terms of a determinant or
summations thereof), and thus completely free of singularities. They are however very
strongly dependent on the relative microscopic positioning of the quantum numbers
between the bra and ket states, and thus cannot be viewed as a ‘smooth’, slowly varying
function of the relevant parameters here. The summation over e should be interpreted at
this stage as running over all excitations deﬁned by allowable changes in the quantum
number conﬁguration for a given microscopic regularization, which essentially splits
up into in-box entropy-like summations and dispersing excitation summation. This
last summation itself has however a completely well-deﬁned thermodynamic limit. We
discuss this point in more detail later on in subsection 3.4.

Formula (65) is already considerably simpliﬁed as compared to the original starting
point (2), in the sense that only a single functional integral remains. It is of quite general
applicability, being valid for arbitrary times t and any smooth operator O. Under mild
assumptions, we can however proceed further using a saddle-point evaluation. We can
assume that the diﬀerential overlap δSe[ρsm], encoding the correlation between quench
overlaps of nearby states in Hilbert space, is non-extensive and thus does not (to leading
order in system size) shift the saddle-point of the numerator as compared to that of the
denominator. Note that this assumption is completely natural: modifying the quantum
numbers of a single particle typically modiﬁes the overlap by a factor which is algebraic
rather than exponential in system size. Then, for operators O whose matrix elements are
not exponentially large in system size (and thus also do not shift the saddle point; we will
then call O thermodynamically ﬁnite), we can use the previously-obtained saddle point
ρsp (52) and get the yet further signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed form (explicitly reintroducing for
convenience the symmetry between putting the excitations in the bra or the ket, which
is implicitly present but not manifest in (65))

This equation is perhaps the most crucial formula of the Quench Action formalism. It
is applicable provided operator O is
(i) weak,
(ii) smooth,

(iii) thermodynamically ﬁnite.

Note the crucial fact that we have not assumed large times while deriving this formula; in
fact, we conjecture that expression (66), evaluated in the thermodynamic limit, is valid
for all times t > 0 provided the operator O is weak, smooth and thermodynamically
ﬁnite. At large times, meaning at times much larger than the lowest considered
excitation energy (that being of order 1/L, and not e−(cst)L like the mean energy spacing),
the formula simpliﬁes to its diagonal part

with right-hand side evaluated on any microscopic realization of the saddle-point state.
This parallels the microcanonical sum used in [28], which can be interpreted as a
generalization of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis [29–32].

In terms of computational complexity, the representation (66) thus displays the fact
that the Quench Action ‘starts from the steady state’ and works its way backwards in
time upon the addition of more and more excitations around the steady state.

3.3. Simpliﬁcations from additivity

Yet a further slightly simpliﬁed version of (66) can be obtained by exploiting the fact
that energies of the individual discrete excitations around the saddle point are additive.

CONTENTS

17

This is a well-known general feature of the thermodynamic limit of the exact eigenstates
we are playing with. More precisely, if e represents the set of excitations (particles,
holes, etc) which have been created on the state described by the thermodynamic root
distribution ρsp, we have

ε(ei)

(68)

ωe[ρsp] =Xi

δSe[ρ] =Xi

in which ε(ei) is a single function representing the dispersion relation for excitations
around the saddle point (and obtainable via the GTBA).

We can even go one step further and assume that, similarly to the energies, the
diﬀerential overlap splits into decoupled functions of the individual excitations+, namely
that there exists a single complex-valued function s such that

s(ei) + ...

(69)

encoding the overlap diﬀerences between states appearing in the sum (66). Such a
function can be read from considering the scaling of the exact overlaps as system size
goes to inﬁnity, an example being formula (98) (from (A14) of [25]). In fact, one cannot
a priori exclude the possibility that (69) can be oversimpliﬁed, and that one should
include a whole series of additional many-body terms
s(2)(ei1, ei2) + ...

(70)

δSe[ρ] =Xi

s(ei) + Xi1<i2

In most situations however the two-body term (and higher ones) would carry only ﬁnite-
size corrections. The fact remains that the function s (and eventually it’s many-body
corrections) can be obtained directly from the exact overlaps. We will provide examples
of this in the next section.

We can in fact push the preceding logic one step further. Let us examine in some

more detail the required matrix elements

hρsp|O|ρsp; ei.

(71)

Physically relevant operators are such that the value of such a matrix element decreases
upon inserting more and more excitations. Moreover, the factor by which the matrix
element decreases upon adding an excitation, depends primarily on the added excitation,
with additional corrections coming from the interplay between excitations. This leads
us to propose to represent the matrix elements (71) in terms of weights h as

hρsp|O|ρsp; ei = e−hO

ρsp;e,

(72)

these weights taking complex values in general; for a normalized operator, the real part
is however naturally bounded from below. One can of course ‘lift’ this representations
to the operator level, writing O = e−ˆhO
ρsp in terms of the ‘operator pseudo-Hamiltonian’
ˆhOρsp (note that this pseudo-Hamiltonian depends on both the operator and saddle-
point state). Somewhat in parallel to the Quench Action itself, the so-deﬁned operator

+ Formally, the notions here can be shown to converge for the box-averaged states introduced in
subsection 3.4.

Hamiltonian is a measure of the importance of eigenstates as far as expectation values
are concerned.
Important states have small (real part of) pseudo-energy; conversely,
states with negligible matrix elements correspond to high pseudo-energy states. The
potentially crucial simpliﬁcation comes if the weights can then be expressed (as done
above for the diﬀerential overlaps) in terms of one-, two-, ... body functions,

he =Xi

h(ei) + Xi1<i2

h(2)(ei1, ei2) + ...

(73)

An operator which is not too dissimilar to the operator creating individual particle-hole
excitations would naturally be represented using only the ﬁrst few terms to achieve
good accuracy. The advantage of looking for such a representation is that the whole
operator structure is then encoded in the smallest number of parameters possible. This
topic, which has not yet been implemented beyond unpublished isolated cases and goes
beyond the Quench Action towards the computation of correlations on generic states,
will be investigated further in future works.

To summarize, in order to reconstruct the full time dependence of the expectation

value of the weak, smooth operator O, the only ingredients that are needed are:
(i) the saddle-point distribution ρsp,
(ii) the excitation energy function ε∗
(iii) the characteristic quench overlap function s (and if needed its higher-body parts

s(2) etc.), and

(iv) the matrix elements hρsp|O|ρsp;{e}i for states around the saddle point, either

directly or in terms of the relevant operator’s pseudo-Hamiltonian.

These can be viewed as the distilled ‘eﬀective parameters’ encoding the whole time
evolution of a weak, smooth operator after the quench. Note that the ﬁrst three items
are operator-independent.

3.4. Further steps towards a more ﬁeld theory-like language

It is worthwhile here to discuss how one should properly take the thermodynamic limit of
all our constructions up to now. The point to remember is that the underlying integrable
model provides a fully regularized theory at all energies, to all orders in system size, for
all states and operators. The ﬁnite N equations thus hide all the necessary details of a
regularization scheme which needs to be appended to the ﬁeld theory in order to make
it well-deﬁned. Though we discuss this aspect here in the context of the Quench Action
and its application, the same reasonings are applicable in much more generality.
∗ Note that this is equivalent to specifying the Hamiltonian; the saddle-point distribution ρsp speciﬁes
the Bethe state completely, and thus also the structure of the excitations in its vicinity, including their
density of states. Given a Hamiltonian and a ρsp, all ε can be computed. Conversely, given a ρsp and ε,
all energies are known (and thus so is the Hamiltonian) for states ‘in the vicinity’ of the saddle-point.

CONTENTS

19

As explained above, the actual calculation of (66) should be performed using a
deﬁned microscopic realization of the steady state, for example the ‘maximally ﬂat’
one,

Xe

e−δSe[ρsp]−iωe[ρsp]thρsm|O|ρsm; ei =Xe

e−δSe[ρsp]−iωe[ρsp]th{ρi};{0}|O|{ρi};{0}; ei.(74)

Let us specify the structure of the sum over excitations a little bit more precisely. In our
box regularization, let us as before use latin indices i to label the boxes. The diﬀerence
between the bra and ket states in (74) consists in in-box ‘entropy-like’ modiﬁcations,
accompanied by out-box ‘dispersing’ excitations taking the form of particles or holes
drilled on the overall density proﬁle {ρi}. It is convenient to separate these two types of
excitations explicitly, and to eﬀectively perform a summation over the former. Denoting
the number of such dispersing particle (resp. hole) excitations as np (resp. nh) and the
box which they disperse to by ia, a = 1, ..., np (resp. ¯ib, b = 1, ..., nh), we can represent
the sum over excitations in the example above as

(75)

A few things are worth clarifying. First of all, P{ci}
represents as before the in-box
summations at ﬁxed density proﬁle {ρi}. The factors 1 − δia¯ib enforce the convention
that dispersing particle and hole excitations are chosen by convention not to land in
the same box, this being meaningless since the density set {ρi} is then not modiﬁed
(the sum over conﬁgurations {ci} already takes care of these terms). Multiple particles
(resp. holes) can however land in the same box. We have also exploited the additivity
of the diﬀerential overlap and energy functions around the saddle point.

It is convenient at this stage to introduce ‘box-averaged’ states

|{ρi}ib ≡ e− 1

2 SY Y

{ρi}X{ci}

|{ρi};{ci}i

(76)

obtained by uniformly summing over all in-box conﬁgurations at ﬁxed density. Box-
averaged states are not exact eigenstates of our Hamiltonian; nevertherless, their energy
is well-deﬁned with ﬂuctuations which are exponentially small in system size and can
be neglected in the thermodynamic limit. Box-averaged states are still orthonormal in
the sense that

bh{ρl

with simple algebra and additional lowest/highest-weight conditions

hzj, z†j′i = δjj′,

z†j|{ρi}ib|ρj=lj = 0,

zj|{ρi}ib|ρj=0 = 0.

(79)

These simple operators are somewhat reminiscent of Zamolodchikov-Faddeev operators
in integrable ﬁeld theory [33] (these operators have indeed been used in the context of
quenches, see e.g. [34]). We however want to emphasize that they are not the same:
the simple operators here are still fully microscopics-aware, and permit calculations in
principle to all orders in system size (to put it in ﬁeld theory language: there is no need
for further regularization, there are no inﬁnities present at this stage).

Introducing operators fI, f†I deﬁned as operators removing/adding an occupation at
quantum number I in the full microscopic model, and the in-box symmetric combination

fj ≡PI∈box j fI (one can think of the (un)occupied quantum numbers as a pseudo-spin-

1/2 degree of freedom, with operators fI/f†I as a spin lowering/raising operator, and
the fj, f†j as total spin operators in the representation with total spin lj/2), we have the

in which ˆρj returns the density in box j. The use of introducing box-averaged states is
that these will become the well-deﬁned states in the thermodynamic limit, parametrized
by the density distribution. We can then deﬁne a box-renormalized operator Obr, with
matrix elements in the box-averaged state basis absorbing the renormalization coming
from the in-box summation,

The factors li − ni and n¯i are included for convenience to compensate for the fact
that a particle excitation can be positioned at li − ni positions in box i, and the
hole in n¯i positions, the microscopically-deﬁned matrix element being assumed to
be insensitive to the precise positioning of the dispersing excitations at the level of
resolution corresponding to the box size (this holds true in general and can be veriﬁed
on a case-by-base basis).

CONTENTS

21

The point is that the renormalization factor is density proﬁle-speciﬁc, but is
expected to be only weakly operator dependent and does not depend on the number
or positioning of the dispersing excitations (provided there is a denumerable number of
those). The summation over in-box conﬁgurations is reminiscent of the summation over
soft modes used in [35] (where it was done for soft modes around ground states, leading
to an anomalous power-law renormalization of matrix elements; here, being performed
around ﬁnite-entropy states, the renormalization can be of exponential size). Actually
performing the summations representing the operator renormalization is a nontrivial
task, which needs to be performed on a case-by-case basis. Note that the value of
the matrix elements in this box-averaged state basis (right-hand side of (82)) is now not
bounded in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, they can develop singularities when
particle and hole excitations come closer together (namely when they disperse to boxes
which are closer and closer to each other). Additionally, they also display a crossing
symmetry, namely an equality between putting e.g. a hole in the bra or a corresponding
particle in the ket. These matrix elements thus essentially obtain properties reminiscent
of some of those of form factors in integrable ﬁeld theory [36]. We will get back to this
point in more detail in future publications.

Going back to our discussion, our summation (74) has now become

can equivalently integrate over rapidity variables by using the transformation function
x(λ) (17) and its Jacobian (18). As described earlier, the energy ω and diﬀerential
overlap function δS are also expressible in terms of sums over excitations, the energy
being purely one-body, and the diﬀerential overlap perhaps having some higher-body
parts. Note that formula (85) parallels equation (2.38) in [37], the diﬀerence resting in
the precise deﬁnition of the matrix element (in our case here, box-averaged), and is an
adaptation of the LeClair-Mussardo formula [38] to this highly-oﬀ-vacuum context.

Expression (85) and its mirror term as per (66) then give a more traditionally ﬁeld
theory-looking version of the fundamental equation of the Quench Action formalism, in
the sense that the excitations one sums over are strictly denumerable. Though somewhat
formal, they make clear which kind of contributions need to be taken into consideration
when computing the time dependence in the thermodynamic limit. They might serve
as a diﬀerent way to regularize quenches in integrable ﬁeld theory [39–41].

4. A tour d’horizon of recent applications

For the reader’s orientation in the growing literature making use of the Quench Action,
we here present the basic details of a number of quench situations which have been
handled using its formalism.
It is by no means the intention to be exhaustive or to
review results in detail, but rather to give some pointers to the existing literature and
a bird’s eye overview of the current state of aﬀairs.

4.1. The transverse-ﬁeld Ising model

The ﬁrst problem treated [1] using the general formalism of the Quench Action was that
of the transverse-ﬁeld Ising model

L

H(h) = −J

Xj=1(cid:2)σx

j σx

j+1 + hσz

j(cid:3) ,

with J, h > 0. This model has two phases, one with ferromagnetic order along the x
direction for h < 1, the other being paramagnetic with h > 1, these being separated by a
quantum critical point in the Ising universality class (see e.g. [42]). Bethe Ansatz is not
needed here; diagonalization can be performed using Jordan-Wigner and Bogoliubov
transformations, leading to free dispersive modes αk with diagonal Hamiltonian

H(h) =Xk

εn(k)(cid:18)α†kαk −

1

2(cid:19) ,

εh(k) = 2J√1 + h2 − 2h cos k. (87)

The ﬁrst quench protocol considered consists in preparing the system in the ground
state of (86) for an initial value h0 in the paramagnetic phase h0 > 1, and to suddenly
switch the ﬁeld to value h from t = 0 onwards.

The post-quench reduced density matrix has been computed in [43], giving
aT Wa with a being a vector of Majorana modes a2n−1 =
m(cid:3) σy
n with anticommutation {am, an} = 2δmn, the matrix

ρDM (t) = |ρspihρsp| ∝ e

W being given by tanh(W/2) = Γ [44, 45] in which

Γjk = Tr (cid:2)ρDM (t)akaj(cid:3) − δjk.

The steady state can be obtained by applying the Quench Action method (we refer
the reader to [1] for all details). In this case, the solution to the relevant GTBA can
be obtained directly from the fact that the momentum occupations are conserved. This
leads to the steady state distribution

ρ(k) =

1 − cos ∆k

in which the momenta κj are distributed according to the saddle-point density (89),
Lρ(κj ) . This leads to a Gaussian steady state |ρspi =Qj α†κj α†
κj+1 = κj + 1
−κj|0; hi (the
state |0; hi being the vacuum at ﬁeld value h) with density matrix ρDM

.

(90)

This density matrix obeys Γsp = Γ(t → ∞) and thus indeed equation (67) holds for any
(products of) local operators, oﬀering a simple way of reproducing the form obtained
beforehand [46]. For time-dependent expectation values, equation (66) can similarly be
veriﬁed at the level of the (reduced) density matrix.

To summarize, although this quench problem had been explicitly solved before, the
Quench Action logic allowed to reproduce steady-state results (and also to reobtain the
known time-dependent relaxation behaviour) in a computationally less heavy fashion.

4.2. The BEC to Lieb-Liniger quench

The previous example pertaining to the transverse-ﬁeld Ising belongs to the class of
problems which, due to the absence of interactions, are solvable without invoking
the technology of the Bethe Ansatz. Although the dynamics of such models is
surely representative of generic situations (in particular because the mapping between
interesting observables and the diagonalized modes is sometimes very complex and
nonlocal) and the GGE is expected to hold [47], it is interesting to study situations
where interactions are inevitably strong and no mapping to a simple free theory exists.
Let us thus now turn our attention to what is to the best of the author’s knowledge
the ﬁrst quench problem to be solved analytically in the thermodynamic limit, for post-
quench time evolution in the presence of nontrivial interactions♯.

In the context of bosons in one dimension, if one takes as initial state the ground
state of the noninteracting bosonic gas on a periodic interval of circumference L, namely
the Bose-Einstein condensate-like†† state
√LN N!(cid:16)ψ†k=0(cid:17)N
|0i

in which |0i is the Fock vacuum and ψ†k=0 creates a zero-momentum particle, one can
obtain an interesting quench problem by simply turning interactions on from t = 0
onwards. For deﬁniteness, the interactions are taken to be ultralocal, i.e. the post-
quench Hamiltonian is deﬁned as that of the Lieb-Liniger gas [48],

♯ It is also the author’s favourite personal example of the fact that one’s best papers are sometimes
the most diﬃcult to get published in prime journals.
†† We are abusing the term ‘condensate’ here, since this state has no global particle number ﬂuctuations.

where φ(λ) ≡ 2 atan(λ/c) and the quantum numbers are distinct half-odd integers for
N even and integers for N odd. The wavefunction itself is given by the Bethe Ansatz,

ΨN ({x}|{λ}) = YN≥j1>j2≥1

). (94)

In the initial BEC state, the local number density ﬂuctuations are large, and the
momentum distribution function is by deﬁnition a delta function at zero momentum
carrying the weight of all particles; turning repulsive interactions on must then lead
among others to a broadening of the momentum distribution function, with the suddenly
quenched interaction energy being partly converted to kinetic energy as time progresses.
Since all energies are incommensurately related at ﬁnite c, one does not expect any
persistent oscillations or recurrences in the thermodynamic limit, but rather to see the
system eﬀectively relax to a steady state due to quantum dephasing.

The search for a solution to this quench problem has an interesting history (which
will be discussed later on).
It was solved exactly in [25] using the Quench Action
formalism, and what follows is a brief summary of some important aspects of this
solution.

In order to implement the Quench Action for this protocol, the
4.2.1. Overlaps.
overlaps between the BEC state (91) and the eigenstates (94) of the Lieb-Liniger gas (92)
should be obtained. This seems, a priori, to pose insurmountable diﬃculties: although
Bethe states are indeed composed of linear combinations of plane waves, which seem to
correspond seamlessly to the eigenstates of a free Hamiltonian (and even more to the
especially simple and structureless BEC state), the problem is that these plane waves are
deﬁned only on ﬁnite segments in coordinate space, and the overlap integrals always leave
incommensurate phases hanging. A basic attempt at calculating the overlap using real-
space integrals thus yields a factorially large sum of terms with no immediately obvious
simpliﬁcation in the general case. For the Lieb-Liniger gas in the Tonks-Girardeau
limit, overlaps with the BEC state can be obtained [49] as products of the inverse of the
rapidities.

Amazingly, for the BEC state, at any value of the interaction parameter, a dramatic
simpliﬁcation in fact turns out to be possible: one ﬁnds [25, 50] that the exact overlaps
(which are only nonvanishing for parity-symmetric states, namely states in which the
rapidity distribution is mirror-symmetric about the origin; this fact, with the Bethe
equations, allows to perform simpliﬁcations) are exactly given by the relatively simple

with K Q(λ, λ′) = K(λ, λ′) + K(λ,−λ′). This overlap formula is extremely econominal,
in the sense that its complexity scales only with the third power of system size due to
its determinant structure, instead of the factorially large worst-case expectation. It is
reminiscent not only of the Gaudin norm formula, but of the matrix elements of local
density or ﬁeld operators for this model [22, 51].

4.2.2. The steady state from the Quench Action. For the application of the Quench
Action, only the extensive part of the (logarithmic) overlap is required, which can be
extracted from (95). The distribution-dependent extensive part of the overlap is

parity-invariance of the states by integrating over the positive rapidity half-line only),
to give the Quench Action (50). The variational condition (52) then gives (with proper
handling of the ﬁlling of the gas, see the original paper [25] for details) a functional
equation for the steady-state root distribution ρsp. Deﬁning η(λ) = ρh(λ)

As expected, the plot of these distributions (see Fig. 1 of [25]) shows an origin-centered,
broadened peak which is non-thermal in shape. From this distribution, steady-state
properties can be computed. In [25], the local static density moments g2,3 with

were computed in the thermodynamic limit by using the above-obtained steady state
and the method described in [52, 53]. The static structure factor

(104)

was itself computed in a ﬁnite-size regularization of the steady state by using ABACUS
[54] and an adaptation of the ﬁnite-temperature method developed in [55].

A direct, coordinate Bethe Ansatz-based numerical veriﬁcation of the Quench
Action predictions for the properties of the steady state was obtained in [56]. Few-
particle properties were well reproduced, 3-body ones less so, which is to be expected
in view of ﬁnite-size corrections (the numerics was done for up to 5 particles; a 3-body
term is then not a weak operator).

4.2.3. Charges, divergences and GGE. Let us end this subsection with a reminder of
the interesting history of the (attempts at a) solution of this quench protocol. The
natural starting point, namely to attempt a GGE treatment, was pursued in [57] based
on the second-quantized representations of the conserved charges, the idea being that
these can in principle be readily evaluated in the initial BEC state. For the Lieb-
Liniger model, the natural charges to consider are those coming from the transfer matrix
with evaluation point around inﬁnity (see [18] and references therein). This leads to a
hierarchy of charges ˆQ(n) with eigenvalue equations

N

ˆQ(n)|{λ}Ni = Q(n)({λ}N ), Q(n)({λ}N ) =

The generic form for the GGE would then be, in operator and eigenvalue forms,

with parameters βn determined from the initial conditions as per the GGE prescription.
The implementation of the GGE for this problem however hits a snag. Higher
conserved charges [58] have terms which are not quantum mechanically normal-
ordered. Although evaluating these charges (deﬁned with c-dependent coeﬃcients) on an
eigenstate of the ‘correct’ Hamiltonian (namely the same c as that used in the deﬁnition

CONTENTS

27

of the charge) leads to a well-deﬁned eigenvalue, due to mutual cancellations between
delta functions originating from the kinetic and interaction terms. This cancellation
however does not occur when evaluating a charge deﬁned at c′ on a state deﬁned at
c 6= c′.

This is reﬂected in the divergence of the t = 0 expectation value of the higher
charges on the BEC state, as can be seen from direct calculations [59]. The exact
Quench Action solution for the steady state reproduces these divergences correctly: for
all post-quench interaction values c > 0, the saddle-point distribution (102) has a 1/λ4
tail at large rapidity,

ρsp(λ) =

(107)

1

2π (cid:20)n4γ2
λ4 +

n6γ3(24 − γ)

4λ6

+ ...(cid:21)

(these ﬁrst two terms in the expansion were obtained in [60] using q-bosons; the Quench
Action solution can be expanded to any order if one feels motivated). The presence
of this tail has dramatic consequences as far as conserved charges are concerned, since

now all even charges with index ≥ 4 become inﬁnite, ´ ρsp(λ)λ2n → ∞, n ≥ 2. The

divergence of Q(4) is like δ(x = 0) (namely: the dimension of momentum space, inﬁnite
here since we are in the continuum without a UV cutoﬀ), with higher charges diverging
more and more strongly.

The GGE logic therefore cannot be applied to this particular quench problem (which
is another reason, at least for the author, to ﬁnd this problem particularly interesting).
These presence of these divergences motivated the study in [60] (updating [57]) by
considering a regularization of the problem in terms of q-bosons, for which a partial
GGE could be consistently implemented. A full GGE was however out of reach, and it
remained for the Quench Action to provide for a full solution.

This problem with divergences is not conﬁned to the BEC to Lieb-Liniger quench.
The three preconditions for its existence are that the Hilbert space be inﬁnite-
dimensional (e.g. here on the continuum interval, there is no UV cutoﬀ), that the
maximal value of the interaction potential be unbounded (here, a delta function), and
that the quench protocol involve a change of this interaction potential.
It is thus
anticipated that a more generic Lieb-Liniger quench protocol going from c to a diﬀerent
c′ would display the same divergences, and also any form in interaction quenches in
multi-species generalizations of Lieb-Liniger.

Using the perspective oﬀered by the exact solution of the problem using the
Quench Action, we can note that the forms (106) and (98) are incompatible due to
the logarithmic singularity in the latter (this being an exact result), which cannot
be recaptured by power-sum (or polynomial-type) conserved charge eigenvalues. One
suggestive way to ‘repair’ the GGE for the BEC to Lieb-Liniger quench is thus to include
a charge which does not directly originate from the usual trace identities coming from
the transfer matrix. If one included a ‘log’ charge with eigenvalue

Qlog({λj}) =

N

(108)

CONTENTS

28

then the exact QA free energy (98) trivially becomes of GGE form (with only this
single charge!). This charge (a kind of ‘logarithm of particle energy’) does not appear
physically meaningful at ﬁrst sight, though it is mathematically completely well deﬁned
(its matrix elements on the basis of Bethe states are all well-deﬁned, at least for the even
particle number sector) and it gives meaningful, extensive values on ‘normal-looking’
Bethe states and is thus probably of (quasi?)local nature. This way of ‘repairing’ the
GGE does not correspond to a kind of UV regularization as oﬀered by the q-boson
approach. Whether one can ascribe any meaning to all of this is an open issue.

A physically perhaps more intuitive way to save the situation is to consider a slightly
modiﬁed quench problem, whereby the initial state is not the perfect BEC state, but a
UV/high-energy regularized one e−ǫHLL|Ψ0i. This modiﬁcation of the initial state leads
to the exponential suppression of the mode occupation at rapidities λ ≫ 1√ǫ, and thus
to the regularization of all inﬁnities in the initial values of the charges. This approach,
which is also a kind of UV regularization, is discussed in more detail in [61].

4.2.4. Time evolution. The time evolution following the BEC to Lieb-Liniger quench
can in principle be computed using the Quench Action method, using the fundamental
representation (66).
Besides the saddle-point distribution (102), one needs the
diﬀerential overlap function (64), which was calculated in the original paper [62] (see
equation (A14)) and indeed obeys the expected decomposition (69) as a sum of one-body
terms,

δSe[ρsp] =

where ˜λp,h are the particle and hole excitation rapidities and

sp(λ)/ρsp(λ)]−1 is the saddle-point state’s ﬁlling function.

These ingredients were used in the speciﬁc case of a quench from the BEC state to
hard-core (Tonks-Girardeau) bosons, to obtain the exact analytical expression for the
time-evolved one-body density matrix [62], this taking the form of a diﬀerence between
two Fredholm Pfaﬃans.
In addition, the previously-derived time-dependent density-
density correlation [63] was reobtained using the Quench Action logic.

The QA was further employed to study the time dependence of observables at
generic interaction in [64], suggesting that power-law relaxation should be generic at
late times for observables which do not create large numbers of particle-hole excitations.
Further investigation of speciﬁc examples of other observables is a promising research
direction for the future.

4.3. The N´eel to XXZ quench

Following up on the solution to the BEC to Lieb-Liniger quench described above, the
Quench Action was then applied to a problem in the context of spin chains. More
precisely, the initial state deﬁned by the N´eel state

with anisotropy parameter ∆ ≥ 1 lying in the antiferromagnetic region. The initial state
(112) is the ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian at ∆ → ∞, so this can be viewed as
an ‘interaction’ quench in the spin chain language. For deﬁniteness, periodic boundary
conditions are used.

In contrast to the repulsive Lieb-Liniger model, the XXZ chain admits bound

states, taking the form of string patters in the solution to the Bethe equations,

η being related to the chain’s anisotropy parameter by the relation ∆ = cosh η. The
real parameter λj
α represents the string center, namely the ‘center of mass’ of the
composite object represented by the n rapidities. The string deviations δj,a
α are in
most circumstances exponentially small in system size, and can typically be neglected,
in which case one works in the so-called string hypothesis. Under this, the Bethe
equations become equations for the string centers, the Bethe-Gaudin-Takahashi (BGT)
equations [17, 19, 65, 66]

Unlike in the Lieb-Liniger model (where there is no UV cutoﬀ and thus no limit on the
quantum numbers), there exist limiting quantum numbers at each string level, which
depend on the ﬁllings of each level (we omit those details here for the sake of brevity).
The string center rapidities are deﬁned in the interval [− π

The thermodynamic limit of the XXZ chain is expressed as before in terms of

4.3.1. Overlaps. As before, the necessary starting point when aiming to implement a
Quench Action treatment is to study the overlaps between the initial state (112) and
the exact eigenstates of (113). Building on earlier work [67, 68], it was shown in [69, 70]
that these overlaps are given by [69]

(95). This is natural in view of the fact that the latter can in fact be viewed as a limit
of the former (see [50]). Also, once again, only parity-invariant states contribute.

to implement the Quench Action protocol and obtain an exact solution to the N´eel to
XXZ quench problem (an extended treatment is published in [72]). Let us recall a few
of the important aspects of this solution.

yielding [71] equations similar to the thermal equilibrium ones (120) but with diﬀerent
driving terms (h being again a chemical potential/magnetic ﬁeld enforcing the ﬁlling
constraint of zero magnetization):

(126)

Similarly to the thermal equilibrium case, there exists also a more aesthetic form of
these coupled equations making use of Takahashi’s decoupling scheme. We omit these
here for succinctness and refer to [71, 72] for this alternative version.

4.3.3. GGE using the transfer matrix charges. A GGE treatment including the
traditional charges (those emanating from the usual ‘spin-1/2’ transfer matrix of the
form (22)) was proposed in [73], and thereafter exactly implemented using all charges
in [71], starting from the expectation value of these computed in the N´eel state in
reference [74]. A rather surprising fact was obtained in [71, 72], namely that the
constraints

lim

t→∞hΨ(t)| ˆQ(a)|Ψ(t)i = h{ρn,sp}| ˆQ(a)|{ρn,sp}i

(127)

do not ﬁx all the densities of the steady state, but rather only ﬁx the density of holes
of one-strings,

ρh
1;sp(λ) =

π2a3

1(λ) sin2(2λ)

π2a2

1(λ) sin2(2λ) + cosh2(η)

.

(128)

This means that all other densities corresponding to higher strings are actually left free
to ﬂuctuate, meaning that constraints seem to be missing, as also noticed in [75, 76].

This fact is indeed demonstrated by comparison to the exact Quench Action solution
to the problem, leading to the somewhat shocking and unexpected conclusion that the
GGE based on these traditional charges only, failed to converge to the exact Quench
Action prediction for the steady state, the diﬀerence being markedly illustrated in the
diﬀerent distributions of even-length bound states at the origin (see Fig. 1 in [71]). These
diﬀerences in distributions aﬀect the observables, for example the local spin correlations;
these diﬀerences were veriﬁed using numerics based on a linked-cluster expansion. In
a back-to-back paper [77] (with extended version [78]), the results for the N´eel quench
were reproduced and extended to the dimer product state

|Ψ(t = 0)i =

1

2(N +1)/2(cid:16)|(↑↓ − ↓↑)(↑↓ − ↓↑)...i + |(↓↑ − ↑↓)(↓↑ − ↑↓)...i(cid:17)

(corresponding to the ground state of the Majumdar-Ghosh model [79]). The great
virtue of the dimer state is that it showed an even more dramatic contrast between
the Quench Action and GGE predictions than the N´eel case, with the discrepancies

(129)

being clearly exposed in numerical veriﬁcations using inﬁnite size time evolved block
decimation. This study was later extended to include a wider class of q-dimer initial
states (for which exact overlaps are known [80]) in [78], including more a detailed study
of the local longitudinal and transverse spin-spin correlations. These studies provided
additional conﬁrmation that the Quench Action provided the correct answers for the
steady state.

As far as the steady state is concerned, the story concerning the discrepancy
between the exact Quench Action results and the GGE was brought to a close with the
understanding that the correct GGE [81] in the case of quantum spin chains needed to
also involve families of quasilocal conserved charges generated from higher-spin transfer
matrices. We refer to the accompanying paper [82] for an extensive introduction to
these quasilocal charges and to their use in diﬀerent contexts, and to [83] for a rigorous
discussion of locality as far as thermalization is concerned.

4.4. Other applications

To close this section, although it is not our intent to review the ﬁeld here,
let us
nonetheless brieﬂy mention that the Quench Action has already been used in many other
contexts in addition to those already described, including the sine-Gordon model [84],
geometric quenches in free fermionic chains [85], the Kondo model [86] and Bragg pulses
in bosonic gases [87]. Another very interesting case is that of the extension of the
BEC to repulsive Lieb-Liniger quench work [25] to the attractive case [88], which also
relates to the KPZ equation [89]. Since this model supports bound state excitations,
the implementation of the Quench Action requires treating multiple root distributions,
similarly to what needs to be done in the case of quantum spin chains. These illustrate
the variety of contexts in which the method can be fruitfully applied.

5. Roadmap and perspectives

5.1. The hunt for overlaps

Taking a step away from speciﬁc cases of implementation of the Quench Action, it
is worthwhile discussing the most important building blocks of the Quench Action,
namely the exact overlaps which stand at the base of the whole formalism. Restricting
our discussion for the moment to the case of quantum quenches, the general problem is
to ﬁnd workable expressions for the overlaps

hΨ0|{I}ig ≡ hΨ0|{λ}ig

(130)
between some initial state |Ψi and the eigenstates of a certain (preferably, though
not necessarily integrable) Hamiltonian with interaction parameter g, which we have
denoted alternately in terms of quantum numbers or rapidities solving the relevant
Bethe equations (including normalization).

The two cases we have discussed in more detail, namely the BEC to Lieb-Liniger
quench on the one hand, and the N´eel to XXZ quench in the other, rely on overlaps

CONTENTS

33

described in [67–70]. An interesting further proposal provides some recursive expressions
for overlaps of simple product states [90].

It is not trivial to generalize these results to more general initial states. In fact, these
two problems share many similarities with each other. The resemblance between (95)
and (121) is particularly striking, and we can wonder how general similar constructions
could be. Gaudin’s formula, giving the norm of a Bethe eigenstate in terms of the
determinant of the Gaudin matrix, has a clear intuitive origin: the quantum numbers
of an eigenstate can be viewed as the proper independent variables labelling a state,
and the measure for summation over eigenstates is ﬂat in quantum number space.
Since the Bethe equations deﬁne the mapping between quantum number space and
rapidity space, the measure for summation over eigenstates, when translated to rapidity
space, gets rescaled by the Jacobian of the transformation between quantum numbers
and rapidities, namely by the determinant of the Gaudin matrix whose entries are the
derivatives of the Bethe equations (second derivatives of the Yang-Yang action). The
fact that the overlaps (95) and (121) are given by a Gaudin-like matrix is however less
intuitive from the outset: these overlaps can be viewed as a kind of ‘square-root norm’
originating from the partition function of the 6-vertex model with reﬂecting boundary
conditions [67], but the deeper meaning of these identities remains obscure at this stage.
An interesting open challenge is to try to generalize (95) to the case of a generic

free boson initial state

|Ψ0i = |{k}Ni.

(131)
For generic choices of momenta {k}N , the overlap with Bethe states cannot be of
Gaudin-like form (95). In fact, the perspective for the obtention of a genuinely useful
representation of the overlaps is pessimistic: one can create the states (131) by applying a
product of single-particle creation operators on the vacuum; alternately, the overlap can
be viewed as the overlap of the vacuum with the remnants of the Bethe states after acting
with the free boson annihilation operators. Whether the in principle factorially large
sum which remains can be expressed in an economical determinant-like form remains
an open issue at this stage. Note however that the obtention of a workable formula here
would in principle solve the extremely interesting and important problem of calculating
overlaps of eigenstates at diﬀerent values of the interaction parameter,

gh{I}|{I}ig′,

(132)

by simply using the free bosonic basis as an intermediate basis. We leave this problem
as an outstanding challenge to the community, noting in passing that there is one case
in which such a formula can be obtained: for the Richardson model

H =Xα Xσ=↑,↓

c†ασcασ − g Xα1,α2

εα
2

c†α1↑

c†α1↓

cα2↓cα2↑,

(133)

one can write the exact overlap between states at diﬀerent values of g [91] by invoking
Slavnov’s theorem. Although the Quench Action method is not usable here (the
thermodynamic limit of this model is inherently mean-ﬁeld), the algebraic structure
of the overlaps might serve as inspiration for other non mean-ﬁeld-like cases.

CONTENTS

34

The problem we just mentioned, namely that of the overlap between exact
eigenstates of Hamiltonians with diﬀering interaction parameters, is formally written
in terms of Algebraic Bethe Ansatz operators as
)|0i

B(g′)(µ(g′)

C (g)(λ(g)

(134)

h0|Yj

j )Yk

k

in which we have explicitly labeled the monodromy matrix operators B, C in terms
of the interaction parameter since the algebra of these operators explicitly depends on
these interaction parameters. Similarly, the sets of rapidities are superscripted by the
value of the interaction parameter for which they solve Bethe equations. Although
the commutation relations between ABA operators pertaining to a given interaction
parameter are relatively simple (namely the usual quadratic algebra), the ‘cross’-algebra
giving the commutation relations between operators at diﬀerent interaction values is
dramatically more complicated. One can however dream of a higher algebraic structure
intertwining the ABA operators at g with those at g′; this structure, which might take
the form of some exponentiated, continuous unitary transformation, remains however
elusive at this stage. A more immediately workable but still interesting possibility is
thus to exploit the crucial feature making Slavnov’s theorem interesting, namely that
the overlaps

h0|Yj

C(λj)Yk

B(µk)|0i

(135)

(in which we now consider a single interaction parameter g) are exactly known provided
one of the sets {λ} or {µ} solves the Bethe equations, the other set being completely
arbitrary. It is thus possible to immediately write ovelaps between Bethe states and
generic initial states

|Ψ0i ≡ |{µ}i

(136)

for arbitrary (but judiciously chosen so at to make the problem interesting) state-deﬁning
rapidity set {µ}. Although the precise nature of such states is not immediately obvious,
it can in principle be quantiﬁed by mapping the states back to Bethe states (again
invoking Slavnov’s theorem) and computing representative observables. By cleverly
choosing these sets of rapidities based on known intuitions, one can deﬁne whole families
of quench problems whose solution via the Quench Action becomes straightforward. We
suggest this as a line worth exploring in the future.

Finally, an important point to bear in mind for the application of the Quench
Action method is that the knowledge of the exact overlaps to all orders in system size
is overkill, at least as far as the determination of the steady state is concerned. For this
purpose, only the leading extensive part of the logarithmic overlap is needed. It might
be possible to devise simpliﬁed schemes in which such leading parts can be obtained,
bypassing exact calculations. Results on these, when fed back into the Quench Action
formalism, would allow to reconstruct the full time evolution of observables from quench
time to the steady state. We again leave this as an open challenge.

5.2. Simplicity and solvability

35

In both the BEC to Lieb-Liniger and the N´eel to XXZ quenches, remarkably, the
simplicity of the original state has imprinted itself in the analyticity of the solution to the
GTBA for the steady state. The existence of a closed-form solutions for (generalized)
TBA equations is atypical (an interesting early example being the appearance of Airy
functions in integrable N = 2 supersymmetric models [92]). What the deeper meaning
of this fact is, and whether such a ‘simplicity-analyticity’ correspondence holds for other
quenches, are interesting questions for the future.

5.3. Relaxation: it’s not the destination, it’s the journey

The one direction which probably oﬀers the most prospects for new results is the one of
the analysis of the time-dependent behaviour of observables after quenches. It is natural
for theoretical eﬀorts to have been up to now mostly directed at the characterization of
steady states, since oﬀ-diagonal terms in the expectation values can then be dropped. On
the other hand, the presence of any integrability-breaking term [93–95], even arbitrarily
weak, destroys the long-time limit, presumably thermalizing it, though the timescales for
this can be very large. Shifting the focus away from the steady state, it is obvious that
even more interesting physics is to be obtained in the actual relaxation process itself, for
which the Quench Action oﬀers a handle. We have showed some results on this in the
case of the BEC quench in Lieb-Liniger. These constructions could be extended to more
complicated observables at the cost of surmountable computational diﬃculties. In the
Tonks-Girardeau limit, the explicit time dependence can be constructed (from direct
calculations which are easily reproducible from the Quench Action) for quenches such
as the trap release [96] or a Bragg pulse [87]. In the low-density limit, generic quenches
also lead to Tonks-Girardeau behaviour [97].

Time dependence in the case of the N´eel quench or of the dimer quench in spin chains
(studied in e.e.g [98]) is something which is in principle accessible to the Quench Action
but remains to be done. At generic interaction value, for complicated but meaningful
quantities such as (relative) time- and space-dependent spin correlations, one diﬃculty
is that it then requires the computation of matrix elements on states with mixed string
contents, in highly-excited quantum number conﬁgurations. This has been explored
in some recent works [37, 53, 99]. Numerically, it is possible to perform the necessary
summations in (66) by using the ABACUS algorithm, whose logic is applicable starting
from any (even highly excited) state, though the summations become diﬃcult to perform
due to the ﬁnite entropy of the starting state and to the large system sizes required.

5.4. Towards a phenomenological classiﬁcation of relaxation behaviours

We have seen before that the implementation of the Quench Action requires as
ingredients:
the saddle-point distribution ρsp and the characteristic quench overlap
function s. Given the excitation dispersion relations ε (deﬁned by ρsp if the Hamiltonian

CONTENTS

36

is speciﬁed), and given an observable O which we are interested in, a knowledge if its
matrix elements then allows to compute the post-quench time dependent expectation
value, using the fundamental representation (66), ‘working backwards’ from the steady
state by including more and more excitations.

Going further with the idea of ‘working backwards’, one can simply turn the tables
around and back-engineer quench problems by postulating the saddle-point ρsp and
characteristic overlap function s. Given these, one can then try to solve the inverse
problem of determining which kind of state stood at the pre-quench origin of time. The
level of exactitude with which this state can be determined depends on the detailed
knowledge of s. Starting with the basics, one can imagine that many diﬀerent initial
states relax to the same saddle-point ρsp. How this relaxation occurs then becomes
dependent on the interplay between the characteristics of ρsp (e.g. its inﬂection points)
and those of the overlap function s and dispersion relation ε. One could thus develop
the notion of ‘universality classes’ of types of relaxation behaviour based on these
characteristics.

5.5. Driven systems

An interesting exploratory route is to consider a much more brutally out-of-equilibrium
situation, namely a periodically-driven system, in other words Floquet dynamics. The
driving would then be periodic over a period T ; in its simplest form, one can envision a
‘quench-dequench’ cycle switching between Hamiltonians H1 (for a duration of t1) and
H2 (duration t2, with T = t1 + t2) with Floquet operator

e−it2H2e−it1H1.

(137)

Starting from a given initial state, repeated application of the Floquet operator will keep
the system from equilibrating. If one focuses on observables measured at stroboscopic
times (namely always at the same instant in the Floquet cycle), one can however expect
pseudo-relaxation, in the sense that the system would tend to eﬀectively relax to one of
the set of Floquet eigenstates. The logic of the Quench Action can be applied to describe
such stroboscopic observables, the Floquet eigenstates now taking on the previous role
played by the Hamiltonian eigenstates in the quench problem. A steady-state can be
expected (i.e. relaxation to a saddle-point Floquet eigenstate, see an example in spin
chains in [100]) again due to the large relative dephasings. Finding this stroboscopic
steady state would again be the result of an optimization procedure following the logic
of the Quench Action. We have not yet been able to control such a calculation, and
leave the ﬁnding of such an example as another open problem.

5.6. Non-integrable models

Although we have used the language of Bethe Ansatz to present the logic of the Quench
Action, this is not a necessary requirement. Precisely the same steps can be followed
in complete generality, the whole ediﬁce being based on the existence of an eigenbasis

CONTENTS

37

(which, if it doesn’t exist, points to a somewhat more fatal issue). The reason why
Bethe Ansatz solvable models are productively used in actual implementations of the
Quench Action is that they provide all the necessary ingredients: states, overlaps, matrix
elements. One could imagine for example a future in which numerical methods, perhaps
based on matrix-product states, are able to deliver a set of practical tools from which
quench problems can be treated using the Quench Action logic.

6. Conclusions

In the short time since its formulation, the Quench Action has already shown itself to be
a useful framework for computing the time-dependent expectation values of operators
after quenching to an integrable model (alternately, after releasing an arbitrary initial
state into such a system), valid for arbitrary times all the way to the (dephased and
equilibrated) steady state. We have shown that in the thermodynamic limit, for a
wide class of operators (those which are not entropy-producing), it allows to encode
the full time evolution of expectation values into the very economical representation
(66). The existence of this representation relies on the fact that the only signiﬁcantly
contributing states are to be found in the vicinity of a ‘saddle point’ state, obtained as
the extremum state of an eﬀective action functional, the Quench Action, which is fully
speciﬁed by the initial conditions/quench protocol. Besides giving a clear mechanism
for calculations in explicitly-deﬁned protocols, the treatment presented here opens the
door to a phenomenological classiﬁcation of the possible time-dependent behaviours by
‘back-engineering’ an inverse problem starting from the steady state.

Using the Quench Action framework, a number of exact results have been obtained
for quenches to nontrivially interacting problems in the thermodynamic limit, some of
which were summarized here. It is expected that many more such examples exist and
can be found starting from the knowledge and techniques currently at our disposal.

The examples discussed in detail here were in translationally-invariant systems. The
Quench Action has already been applied to situations where this invariance is broken,
e.g. [85,86]. In the absence of translational invariance, interesting aspects emerge. Extra
charges must then be included in the GGE [101]. A diﬀerent context one could consider
in the future is that of many-body localization [102], where translational invariance is
also severely broken.

Results from the Quench Action also provide extremely stringent tests for other
methods. Notably, the exact solution for the N´eel to XXZ quench using the Quench
Action has enabled the correct formulation of the GGE for interacting models (at
least in the context of spin chains), where extended sets of (quasilocal) charges were
needed to reproduce the exact QA solution. In the context of interaction quenches in
1d gases, the QA solution to the BEC to Lieb-Liniger quench exists but has not yet
been reproduced using a properly-formulated GGE. Looking further at beyond-GGE
properties, the time dependence of observables (which the QA can also access, though
the number of worked-out cases here is more limited), could similarly provide tough

CONTENTS

38

benchmarks for time-dependent numerical methods like tDMRG and ITEBD. Finally,
these ﬁnite-time calculations could potentially be used to provide explicit experimental
phenomenology, extending what has been achieved for the equilibrium dynamics of
integrable spin chains [103–108] and Bose gases [109, 110] to an even richer out-of-
equilibrium context.
