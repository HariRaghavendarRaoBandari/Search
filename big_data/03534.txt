ALL 2-POSITIVE LINEAR MAPS FROM M3(C) TO M3(C) ARE

DECOMPOSABLE

YU YANG, DENNY H. LEUNG, AND WAI-SHING TANG

Abstract

Following an idea of Choi, we obtain a decomposition theorem for k-positive linear maps from
Mm(C) to Mn(C), where 2 ≤ k < min{m, n}. As a consequence, we give an afﬁrmative answer to
Kye’s conjecture (also solved independently by Choi) that every 2-positive linear map from M3(C)
to M3(C) is decomposable.

Keywords: positive maps between low-dimensional matrix algebras, k-positivity, de-

composability, Schmidt number, PPT bound entangled states.

1. INTRODUCTION

Let Mn(C) be the algebra of all n× n matrices over the complex ﬁeld C. We say that
a matrix A in Mn(C) is positive semi-deﬁnite, and write A ≥ 0, if A is hermitian and all
eigenvalues of A are non-negative. Denote by M+
n (C) the set of all positive semi-deﬁnite
matrices in Mn(C), and by B(Mm(C),Mn(C)) the space of all linear maps from Mm(C) to
Mn(C).
Deﬁnition 1.1. A linear map f
M+

m (C)) ⊆
n (C).
The identity map on Mn(C) and the transpose map on Mn(C) are denoted by idn and t n

from Mm(C) to Mn(C) is called positive if f (M+

respectively.
Deﬁnition 1.2. A map f
is positive. Similarly, a map f
Mk(Mn(C)) is positive.

is called k-positive if the map idk⊗f

is called k-copositive if the map t k ⊗ f

: Mk(Mm(C)) → Mk(Mn(C))
: Mk(Mm(C)) →

If a map is k-positive (resp. k-copositive) for every k, it is called completely positive
(resp. completely copositive). A positive map is called decomposable if it can be written
as the sum of a completely positive map and a completely copositive map.

In [3], Cho, Kye and Lee introduced the generalized Choi maps and discussed the con-
ditions for the maps to be k-positive or decomposable. For generalized Choi’s map in
B(M3(C),M3(C)), they showed that 2-positivity or 2-copositivity implies decomposabil-
ity. It is natural to ask whether this property holds for every 2-positive or 2-copositive map
in B(M3(C),M3(C)) (see [8, page 1330002-11]).
Conjecture 1.1. Every 2-positive (respectively 2-copositive) linear map in B(M3(C),M3(C))
is decomposable.

Let us recall some useful deﬁnitions. Denote by HA and HB two Hilbert spaces with

dim(HA) = m and dim(HB) = n, respectively.

Sanpera, Bruß and Lewenstein in [10] formulated the following conjecture and pre-

sented strong evidence of its validity for some special cases.
Conjecture 1.2. All bound entangled states with positive partial transpose in C3 ⊗ C3
have Schmidt number 2.

There is a diagram of dual cone relations between quantum states and positive maps (see
[11, 7, 6, 8]). Let us consider the duality between the space Mm(C)⊗ Mn(C) and the space
B(Mm(C),Mn(C)). Let Ei j be the canonical matrix units in Mm(C). For A =Pm
i, j=1 Ei j ⊗
Ai j ∈ Mm(C)⊗ Mn(C) and a linear map f ∈ B(Mm(C),Mn(C)), deﬁne a bilinear form:

hA,f i =

mX

i, j=1

Tr(f (Ei j)At

i j).

Note that for two normed real spaces X and Y which are dual to each other with respect
to a bilinear form h·,·i, the dual cone for a subset C of X is deﬁned as C◦ = {y ∈ Y :
hx,yi ≥ 0 for each x ∈ C}. Denote by Pk[m,n] and Pk[m,n] the set of all k-positive maps
and the set of all k-copositive maps in B(Mm(C),Mn(C)), respectively. Deﬁne convex
cones Vk[m,n] and Vk[m,n] in Mm(C)⊗ Mn(C) as

Vk[m,n] = {zz∗ : SR(z) ≤ k, z in Cm ⊗ Cn}◦◦,
Vk[m,n] = {(zz∗)

: SR(z) ≤ k, z in Cm ⊗ Cn}◦◦.

Here G

is an operation called partial transposition that acts as transposition only on the
ﬁrst part of a tensor product. By the dual correspondence between maps and states, we
have the following diagram:

V1 $ ··· Vk $ Vm∧n = (Mm(C)⊗ Mn(C))+
l
P1 % ··· Pk % Pm∧n ∼= (Mm(C)⊗ Mn(C))+
where m∧ n = min{m,n}. A similar diagram holds in case of copositivity:

Denote by D[m,n] the convex cone given by Pm∧n + Pm∧n. Correspondingly, denote by
T[m,n] the cone of states given by Vm∧nT Vm∧n.

One can check that (D[m,n],T[m,n]) is a dual pair deﬁned through the bilinear pairing
between B(Mm(C),Mn(C)) and Mm(C) ⊗ Mn(C).
It is natural to ask where should we
locate the pair (D[m,n],T[m,n]) in the above two diagrams. Moreover, it follows from
duality in the diagrams that Conjecture 1.1 and Conjecture 1.2 are equivalent.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will give a decomposition theorem
in order to relate a k-positive map in B(Mm(C),Mn(C)) to a (k − 1)-positive map which
actually resides in B(Mm−1(C),Mn(C)). In Section 3, we will give an afﬁrmative answer
to Conjecture 1.1 and hence Conjecture 1.2 too (see Theorem 3.2 and Corollary 3.6). Ex-
amples are provided throughout to illustrate certain aspects of the results obtained in these
sections.

2. A DECOMPOSITION FOR ALL k-POSITIVE / k-COPOSITIVE MAPS

Our approach towards Conjecture 1.1 is to peel off a completely positive map from a 2-
positive map. That is, ﬁnd a completely positive map which is dominated by the 2-positive
map. Moreover, the dimension of the space where the remaining map resides is reduced.
Indeed, this is a dimension-lowering trick. For a positive linear map on matrix algebras, a
classical theorem by Choi [4] is important in determining complete positivity. Before that,
we recall the notion of the Choi matrix for a linear map.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let B(K) and B(H) denote the space of bounded linear operators on ﬁ-
nite dimensional Hilbert spaces K and H, respectively. Let Ei j,i, j = 1, ...,m, be the
canonical matrix units for B(K) and (dim(K),dim(H)) = (m,n). Given a linear map
f ∈ B(B(K),B(H)), the Choi matrix Cf for f

is:

Cf ,

mX

i, j=1

Ei j ⊗ f (Ei j) = [f (Ei j)]m

i, j=1 ∈ Mm(Mn(C)).

Remark 2.2. Obviously the map f
and matrices in Mm(Mn(C)) which preserves linearity.
Theorem 2.3 (Choi,1975). A positive map f ∈ B(B(K),B(H)) is completely positive if

7−→ Cf is a bijection between linear maps in B(Mm(C),Mn(C))

and only if the corresponding Choi matrix is positive.

The peel-off theorem ﬁrst appeared in [9] (see also Størmer’s book [12, pages 38-39]).
Combined with Zorn’s Lemma Størmer obtained a decomposition for positive maps in [13].
Here we present a slightly stronger version (Theorem 2.7) of the peel-off result by block-
matrix approach, which was shown by M.-D. Choi for the case of 2-positive maps [5].
Let us consider k-positive maps for the moment. A similar theorem holds for k-copositive
maps.

Deﬁnition 2.4 (Trivial Lifting). Given a linear map c ∈ B(Ms(C),Mn(C)), ﬁx the canon-
ical matrix unit basis Ei j, i, j = 1, ..,s, in Ms(C), under which the Choi matrix is Cc =
[c (Ei j)]s
i, j=1 ∈ Ms(Mn(C)). Given I = {n1, ...,np} ⊂ {1, ...,s + p}, where n1 < ··· < np,
to a (s + p)× (s + p) block matrix Cli f t
extend the matrix Cc
I ∈ Ms+p(Mn(C)) by adding
one row and one column of n × n zero matrices at the nth
level for each k = 1, ..., p as
follows:

Denote by ˜c I the map in B(Ms+p(C),Mn(C)) associated with the Choi matrix C ˜c I =

Proof. Let h = (w1, ...,wk)T be an arbitrary vector in Ck ⊗ Cm where ws ∈ Cm, s =
1, ...,k. Let ˆws ∈ Cm−1 be deﬁned as (ws
m)T for s = 1, ...,k, and
p+1, ...,ws
ˆh = ( ˆw1, ..., ˆwk) ∈ Ck ⊗ Cm−1. By deﬁnition of p-trivial lifting,
s,t=1 = [c ( ˆws( ˆwt )∗)]k
This matrix equality in Mk(Mn(C)) shows that the pair of maps (c , ˜c p) are k-positive
simultaneously. For k-copositivity, we also have:

s,t=1 = (idk ⊗ c )( ˆh ˆh ∗).

s,t=1 = [c ( ˆwt ( ˆws)∗)]k

s,t=1 = (t k ⊗ ˜c )( ˆh ˆh ∗),

which completes the proof.

Before proving Theorem 2.7, recall a classical result (see [2, Exercise 1.3.5]):

Lemma 2.8. Suppose a hermitian matrix M is partitioned as

B

M =Å A
B∗ Cã ,

where A and C are square matrices. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(1) M ≥ 0.
(2) A ≥ 0, M/A = C− B∗A†B ≥ 0, range(B) ⊆ range(A).
(3) C ≥ 0, M/C = A− BC†B∗ ≥ 0, range(B∗) ⊆ range(C).

Here A† and C† refer to the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverses of A and C, respectively.
Remark 2.9. Recall some properties of the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse A† of a matrix
A (see [1, pages 29-30] ):

P1. AA†A = A, A†AA† = A†.
P2. (AA†)∗ = AA†, (A†A)∗ = A†A.

ALL 2-POSITIVE LINEAR MAPS FROM M3(C) TO M3(C) ARE DECOMPOSABLE

P3. AA† is the orthogonal projector onto the range of A, A†A is the orthogonal projector

onto the range of A∗.

P4. If A is invertible, then A† = A−1.
P5. If A ≥ 0, then A† ≥ 0.

Proof. (of Theorem 2.7) Since the k-positive map f
6= 0, with respect to the canonical
matrix units Ei j, i, j = 1, ...,m, in Mm(C), there exists an index k ∈ {1,2, ...,m} such that
f (Ekk) 6= 0. Otherwise if f (Ekk) = 0 for every k = 1, ..,m, then f (Im) = 0. Meanwhile
for every A ∈ Mm(C)+, ||A||Im− A ≥ 0 yields that 0 = ||A||f (Im) ≥ f (A), implying f = 0,
which contradicts f
6= 0. Without loss of generality, we assume that f (Emm) 6= 0. Decom-
pose the Choi matrix Cf for f , with Ai j = f (Ei j), i, j = 1, ...,m, as follows:

where y 1ïa

Obviously under this splitting, the second and the third matrix in the above equation corre-
spond to a completely positive map y 1 and a completely copositive map y 2, respectively,

In low dimensional cases such as B(M2(C),M2(C)) and B(M2(C),M3(C)), Woronow-
icz and Størmer respectively showed that every positive map is decomposable (see [15]).
In this section, we will show that in B(M3(C),M3(C)), although positive maps may not
be decomposable, 2-positive maps are always decomposable. Let us start with a useful
lemma. For any p ∈ {1, ...,m}, we assume that ˜c p ∈ B(Mm(C),Mn(C)) is the p-trivial
lifting of a positive map c ∈ B(Mm−1(C),Mn(C)).
Lemma 3.1. If c
is decomposable in B(Mm−1(C),Mn(C)), then its trivial lifting ˜c p is also
decomposable in B(Mm(C),Mn(C)).
Proof. Given a decomposable map c ∈ B(Mm−1(C),Mn(C)), then c = c 1 + c 2, where
c 1 is completely positive and c 2 is completely copositive. By Lemma 2.5, one obtains a
completely positive mapfc 1

of c 1 and c 2, respectively. By linearity of the trivial lifting, ˜c p = (·(cid:0)c 1 + c 2)p =fc 1

The next result gives an afﬁrmative answer to Conjecture 1.1.

Theorem 3.2. Every 2-positive or 2-copositive map f
able.

in B(M3(C),M3(C)) is decompos-

Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume the 2-positive(respectively 2-copositive) map
f

is not zero. In this concrete case of B(M3(C),M3(C)), the peel-off process yields that:

f = y + ˜k p for some p ∈ {1, ...,m}

where y
is completely positive (respectively completely copositive) and ˜k p is a p-trivial
lifting of a positive map k ∈ B(M2(C),M3(C)). Since every positive map in B(M2(C),M3(C))
is decomposable in B(M2(C),M3(C)) (see [15]), by Lemma 3.1, the lifted map ˜k p is de-
composable in B(M3(C),M3(C)). Hence, f = y + ˜k p is also decomposable.
(cid:3)
Deﬁnition 3.3. A positive linear map in B(Mm(C),Mn(C)) is called atomic if it is not the
sum of a 2-positive map and a 2-copositive map.

Remark 3.4. From the deﬁnition, an atomic map in B(Mm(C),Mn(C)) is indecomposable.
The converse is true when m = n = 3.

Corollary 3.5. Every indecomposable map in B(M3(C),M3(C)) is atomic.
Corollary 3.6. Under the dual cone correspondence (see [8]), one can completely deter-
mine the set inclusion relations in B(M3(C),M3(C)) as follows:

V1 $ T $ V2 $ V3 = (M3(C)⊗ M3(C))+

Here we denote by Vk the set of all quantum states of Schmidt number k, Pk the set of
all k-positive maps, D the cone of all decomposable maps and T the cone of all positive
partial transpose states.
Remark 3.7. The inclusion T ⊂ V2 gives an afﬁrmative answer to Conjecture 1.2, stating
that all positive partial transpose entangled states in 3× 3 system have Schmidt number 2.
Example 3.8. We will illustrate Choi decomposition using the 2-positive generalized Choi
maps F

[a,b,c](X) =Ñ ax11 + bx22 + cx33

for X = [xi j] ∈ M3(C3), where a,b,c,d are nonnegative numbers. Note that F
[a,b,c] is
2-positive if and only if a ≥ 2 or [1 ≤ a < 2]∧ [bc ≥ (2− a)(b + c)]. Let us consider the
non-trivial case when the map F
[a,b,c] is 2-positive but not completely positive. Hence
a ∈ [1,2) and bc ≥ (2− a)(b + c), which imply that

Since F
[a,b,c] is 2-positive but not completely positive, by condition (∗) the matrices CF 1
and partial transpose of CF 2 are positive, implying that F
2
is completely copositive, respectively. Note that our method of writing the 2-positive map
[a,b,c] as a sum of a completely positive map and a completely copositive map differs

1 is completely positive and F

from another method mentioned in [3, proof of Theorem 3.4]:

√bc)F (cid:2) a−√bc
1−√bc
So the decomposition of the 2-positive map F
map and a completely copositive map is not unique.

[a,b,c] = (1−

,0,0(cid:3)+√bcF (cid:2)1,… b

c

b(cid:3).

,… c

[a,b,c] into a sum of a completely positive

In view of the previous results, it is natural to pose the following

Question 3.9. Does there exist a 2-positive but indecomposable map in B(M3(C),M4(C))?

Most likely this question has an afﬁrmative answer.
