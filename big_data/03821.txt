Abstract

The pre-inﬂationary evolution of the universe describes the beginning of the expansion of the

universe from a static initial state, such that the Hubble parameter is initially zero, but increases

to an asymptotic constant value, in which it could achieve a de Sitter (inﬂationary) expansion. The

back-reaction eﬀects at this moment should describe a vacuum excitation at a geometrical level,

which are studied with detail in this work using Relativistic Quantum Geometry.

INTRODUCTION

The inﬂationary model is a very experienced description of how the universe can provide

a physical mechanism to generate primordial energy density ﬂuctuations on cosmological

scales [1], below Planckian scales. During this stage, the primordial scalar perturbations

drive the seeds of large scale structure which then had gradually formed today’s galaxies,

which is being tested in current observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB)[2].

These ﬂuctuations are today larger than a thousand times the size of a typical galaxy, but

during inﬂation were very much larger than the size of the causal horizon[3]. According to

this scenario, the almost constant potential depending of a minimally coupled to gravity

inﬂation ﬁeld φ, called the inﬂaton, caused the accelerated expansion of the very early

universe. During this epoch, the potential energy density was dominant, so that the kinetic

energy can be neglected. This is known as the slow-roll condition for the inﬂaton ﬁeld

dynamics. In this framework the problem of nonlinear (scalar) perturbative corrections to

the metric has been studied in [4].

Recently, we have introduced a new method to study the scalar perturbations of the met-

ric in a non-perturbative manner[5] by introducing Relativistic Quantum Geometry (RQG).

However at present, we cannot understand completely the ﬁrst epoch of the universal evolu-

tion. How the universe begun to expand and how was the ﬁrst stage of this evolution? The

theory that describes this epoch is called pre-inﬂation[6]. It is supposed that during pre-

inﬂation the universe begun to expand from some Planckian-size initial volume to thereafter

pass to a inﬂationary epoch. In this framework RQG should be very useful when we try

to study the evolution of the geometrical back-reaction eﬀects, because we are dealing with

Planckian energetic scales and back-reaction eﬀects should be very intense at these scales.

In this work we shall describe a model in which the energy density potential is constant

and the scalar ﬁeld remains constant, so that the Hubble parameter is initially zero and

increases to a constant value, in which it could achieve a de Sitter (inﬂationary) expan-

sion. The back-reaction eﬀects at this moment should describe a vacuum excitation at a

geometrical level.

II. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM GEOMETRY: THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE-

TIME IN AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE

We shall consider a metric tensor in the Riemannian manifold with null covariant deriva-

tive (we denote with a semicolon the Riemannian-covariant derivative): ∆¯gαβ = ¯gαβ;γ dxγ =

0, such that the Weylian-like[7] covariant derivative ¯gαβ|γ = θγ ¯gαβ, described with respect
to the Weylian-like connections 1

is nonzero

δ¯gαβ = ¯gαβ|γ dxγ = − [θβ ¯gαγ + θα¯gβγ] dxγ.

The scalar ﬁeld θ(xα) is a generic geometrical transformation that preserves the invariance
of the action δI = 0[8]:

Hence, we obtain

where δθ = θµdxµ is an exact diﬀerential and V =

√−¯g is the volume of the Riemannian

manifold. In the case of an expanding universe, the Riemannian manifold will be described

by the background geometry characterized with a FRW metric. Of course, all the variations

with respect to the expanding background are in the Weylian-like geometrical representation.

As was demonstrated in [9] the Einstein tensor can be written as

¯Gαβ = Gαβ + θα;β + θαθβ +

Λ = −3

and we can obtain the semi-Riemannian invariant (the cosmological constant) Λ

1 To simplify the notation we shall denote θα ≡ θ,α, where the comma denotes the partial derivative.
Furthermore, we shall exalt with a ” bar ” the quantities represented on the Riemannian background
manifold.

Notice that Λ(θ, θα) is a Riemannian invariant, but not a Weylian-like invariant. Hence,

one can deﬁne a geometrical Weylian-like quantum action W = (cid:82) d4x

√−¯g Λ(θ, θα), such

that the dynamics of the geometrical ﬁeld, after imposing δW = 0, is described by the

Euler-Lagrange equations which take the form

III. PRE-INFLATION WITH SLOW-ROLL SCALAR FIELD DYNAMICS

We consider an initial static universe with initial size a0, which begins to expand by the

action of a minimally coupled to gravity scalar ﬁeld φ, described by the action

√−¯g = a3(t) is the volume of the manifold
Here, κ = 8πG, G is the gravitational constant,
M, and ¯gµν = diag[1,−a2,−a2,−a2] are the components of the diagonal tensor metric.
Here, φ(t) is the background solution that describe the dynamics of a isotropic and homo-

geneous background metric that characterizes a semi-Riemannian manifold

¨φ + 3H ˙φ + V (cid:48)(φ) = 0.

(10)

The semi-Riemannian (background) Einstein equations with cosmological constant Λ in-

cluded, are

¯Gαβ ≡ ¯Rαβ − 1

¯R − ¯gαβ Λ = −κ ¯Tαβ.

(11)
After making ¯gαβ ¯Rαβ = ¯R and ¯gαβ ¯Tαβ = ¯T , we obtain that ¯R + 4Λ − κ ¯T = 0, so that, if we
use the fact that ¯T = 4V (φ) − ˙φ2 and we impose V (φ) = 3Λ

From the Eq. (12) it is obvious that V (φ) is a constant, and the equations (12) and (10),

provide us with the dynamics of φ(t) and H(t). From the equation (10), we obtain general

solution for the scalar ﬁeld

˙φ(t) =

C

a3(t)

.

(13)

If we replace this solution in (12), we obtain that there are only three possible solutions.

One of these is interesting to describe pre-inﬂation. This is the case in which C = 0 (i.e.,
˙φ = 0), for Λ > 0, in which the Hubble parameter is the solution of the diﬀerential equation
12H 2 + 6 ˙H = 8Λ, with solution

H(t) =

.

(14)

Notice that ˙H/H 2 > 0. This is a remarkable diﬀerence with models like inﬂation where the
˙H/H 2 < 0. The Hubble parameter has an initial null value

Hubble parameter decreases:

asymptotically constant value H(t)|t(cid:29)G1/2 → 2

is the eigenvalue that results when we apply the operator δˇxα(xβ) on the background quan-
tum state |B(cid:105), deﬁned as a Fock space on the Riemannian manifold. The Weylian-like line

¯U α(cid:1) dS2 δBB(cid:48) = (cid:104)B |δˇxαδˇxα| B(cid:48)(cid:105) .

Hence, the diﬀerential Weylian-like line element dS provides the displacement of the quan-

tum trajectories with respect to the ”classical” (Riemannian) ones.

ment of the big bang, but decrease to zero when ˙H/H 2 → 0. This corresponds just to the
approximation to the de Sitter (inﬂationary) regime.

IV. FINAL COMMENTS

We have studied back-reaction eﬀects in a pre-inﬂationary universe using RQG. This

formalism makes possible the nonperturbative treatment of the vacuum ﬂuctuations of

the spacetime, by making a displacement from a semi-Riemannian to a Weylian-like

manifold. This displacement is driven by a scalar ﬁeld θ, which can be quantized in a such

manner that the semi-Riemannian action remains invariant. In this framework the Einstein

equations with cosmological constant are exactly valid on the Riemannian manifold, but the

quantum eﬀects are described on the Weylian-like one. In this manifold the cosmological

constant is not an invariant, but a Lagrangian density Λ(θ, θα) with which we deﬁne the
quantum action W. This action describes a free (geometrical) scalar ﬁeld that governs
the dynamics of the geometrical quantum ﬂuctuations with respect to the Riemannian

(classical) background. When we apply this formalism to the pre-inﬂationary scenario,

which describes the beginning of the universal expansion, we obtain that the modes of the

geometrical ﬁeld θ are discrete, but inﬁnite in number. The contribution of some of these

to the variation of energy density, were drawn in the ﬁgure (1). Notice that all the modes’s
contributions become asymptoticall null for τ (cid:29) 1. Other distinctive characteristic of this
modes is that they do not are unstable, as the inﬂationary ones[5].
