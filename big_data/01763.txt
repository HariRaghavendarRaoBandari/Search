perturbations and the Huygens principle

We analyze propagation equations for the polar modes of gravitational waves in cosmological
space-times. We prove that polar gravitational waves must perturb — unlike axial modes — the
material content of the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. The whole gravitational
dynamics reduces to the single ”master equation” that has the same form as for axial modes. That
allows us to conclude that the status of the Huygens principle is the same for axial and gravitational
waves.
In particular, this principle is valid exactly in radiation spacetimes with the vanishing
cosmological constant, and it is broken otherwise.

INTRODUCTION

The canonical way to establish the topological type of
the Universe is through the analysis of the Hubble rela-
tion [1]. There would seem to exist an alternative — it
is known that gravitational waves can backscatter on the
curvature of the spacetime. The eﬀects of the backscat-
ter (or equivalently, the breakdown of the Huygens prin-
ciple) would give, in principle at least, a new local way
to see the global topology of a cosmological spacetime in
a way analogous to eﬀects known in the Schwarzschild
spacetime. Quasinormal modes and tails ( [2], [3]) that
are present in the radiation that originated beneath the
light sphere of a black hole would allow its identiﬁcation.
These eﬀects can be vigorous, as seen in the recent detec-
tion of gravitational waves [4]. They have been discussed
in theoretical studies of [5] and [6]; the latter have shown
a positive correlation between the strength of backscat-
tering and the intensity of ringing. The results of [7]
have shown that while axial modes of gravitational waves
indeed do backscatter (with the exception of purely
radiative spacetimes) but this eﬀect becomes signiﬁcant
only for length-waves comparable to the Hubble radius,
and thus cannot be seen in local observations.

In this paper we shall complete the analysis of [7] by
discussing polar modes. That constitutes a technically
demanding task, but the conclusion is the same as in [7]:
backscattering eﬀects cannot be seen locally. There is,
however, a feature, that (we think) is more interesting:
it appears that polar gravitational waves must perturb
the material content of the cosmological universe. This
is in contrast to the axial case, where waves do not couple
with matter.

Regge and Wheeler extracted two gauge-independent
linearized modes (axial and polar) of gravitational waves
in the Schwarzschild spacetime ([8]) and derived an evo-
lution equation for axial modes. They made minor mis-
takes in equations describing propagation of polar modes,
corrected by Zerilli [9].
In the cosmological context,
Malec and Wyl¸e˙zek [7] adapted the method of Regge and
Wheeler and obtained a propagation equation for axial
modes in Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW

thereafter) spacetimes, with vanishing cosmological con-
stant. They found that the Huygens principle is strictly
obeyed in radiation spacetimes and approximately — for
relatively short length-waves - in spacetimes ﬁlled by
dust.

The content of this paper is following. Next section
speciﬁes the FRLW geometries with a non-zero cosmolog-
ical constant, and their (Regge-Wheeler) perturbations.
The material is composed of perfect ﬂuids, and we write
down both the relevant energy-momentum tensor, and
its linearization.

Section 3 derives formerly known results obtained in
[7].
It appears that matter cannot be perturbed by
travelling axial gravitational waves, while the descrip-
tion of waves reduces to a simple propagation equation
( a ”master equation”). Clarkson, T. Clifton, S. Febru-
ary discussed these perturbations in the wider context
of Lemaitre-Tolman cosmologies [10]; their equations, re-
stricted to the FLRW metrics deformed by axial modes,
coincide with those of [7].

The case with polar modes is discussed in Section 4.
The full evolution system consists of six equations; one
can extract a part of the metric that is described by the
master equation, that has the same form as for axial
model and agrees with the corresponding result of [10].
The remaining equations show one minor diﬀerence, com-
paring to [10].

Section 5 deals with the universe ﬁlled by perturbed
perfect ﬂuid. We demonstrate that equations are consis-
tent and we prove that the material (perfect ﬂuid) must
be perturbed by a travelling (polar) pulse.

The vacuum case, de Sitter spacetime, is considered in
Section 6. The whole system of 6 equations is consistent,
reduces to 3 independent equations, the master equation
and two other conditions that completely determine the
linearized metric.

The next section shows that the Huygens principle is
strictly valid only in radiation spacetimes (with Λ = 0),
both to axial and polar modes.

Final section gives a concise description of main results

and comments on their signiﬁcance.

We assume standard gravitational units c = 8πG = 1.

ψ = ψ(η, r), σ = σ(η, r).

it is related to the ”ordinary” Hubble constant H by

H = H
a .

The energy-momentum tensor

Metric Regge-Wheeler perturbations

We shall employ results of Regge and Wheeler [8]. Be-
low we put for notational simplicity Y = Y (θ) := Yl0(θ);
thus

Y ′′ = −l(l + 1)Y − cot θ Y ′,

(3)

where Y ′ = ∂θY .

For completeness we shall consider both polar and ax-
ial modes; in the latter case we again arrive at conclusions
already known from [7].

Axial modes

The axially perturbed components of the metric read

In the former calculation concerning axial gravitational
waves [7] there was no need to perturb the cosmological
background. This is in contrast, as we shall see, with
the polar modes. Below we shall perturb the background
material quantities in both cases, but ﬁnally it appears
that this not needed in the situation discussed in [7].

The tensor Tµν has the form:

Tµν = (ρ + p)uµuν + pgµν − Λgµν.

(8)

The mass density is given by

ρ = ρ0 (1 + e · ∆(η, r)Y ) + o(e2),

(9)

where ρ0 is the background mass density and e ·

Π(η, r)Y is the mass density contrast.

The pressure splits onto p0, the background pressure,

and e · ∆(η, r)Y — the pressure contrast:

gµν = g(0)

µν + e · h(o)

µν + o(e2),

where

(h(o)

(4)

p = p0 (1 + e · Π(η, r)Y ) + o(e2),

(10)

The pressure and mass density perturbations Π and ∆
are related, since ρ and p are related by an equation of
state.

Finally, one should allow the possibility that matter is
not necessarily comoving with the unperturbed cosmo-
logical expansion. Thus the 4-velocity of matter reads

.

(5)

Here h0 = h0(η, r), h1 = h1(η, r). The small parameter
e is introduced for convenience; it measures the strength
of perturbations.

, e · a(η)w(η, r)Y, e · v(η, r)Y ′, 0(cid:17)+o(e2)

(11)

This ensures that uµuµ = −1 + o(e2).

Background Friedman-Lemaitre solution

The (background) isotropic and homogeneous solution

of Friedman equations satisﬁes following relations

of the background spacetime does not feel the propaga-
tion of axial modes.

One can easily check that only two of the remaining

equations are linearly dependent, since

and

a2

˙H.

∂r(f 2 · (21)) − ∂η(f 2 · (20)) = (l(l + 1) − 2) · (19). (22)

The expression ∂r(f 2 · (21)) means that the left hand
side of equation no (21) is multiplied by f 2 and then
diﬀerentiated with respect r. The same convention is
applied in the remaining part of this paper.

(13)

Therefore we can omit one of the two equations, Eq.

(19).

Furthermore, inserting (19) into (21), one arrives at

This agrees with the corresponding result of [7].
The master equation (25) can be solved independently
of the remaining equations — it constitutes one of the
two independent gravitational modes.

From Eq. (19) one gets h0:

The function A(r) is arbitrary, but if σ(η, r) vanishes

at the initial hypersurface, then A(r) = 0.

POLAR MODES: EQUATIONS

The linearization of Einstein equation yields, after
straightforward calculations, three groups of equations.

Notice that the equation (32) onto the function χ sep-

arates from the rest. With the substitution

χ(η, r) = f (r)a(η)Q(η, r),

(33)

one arrives at a result that coincides with the equation
(25).

Again it appears that the master equation can be
solved independently of the remaining equations. This
implies that the metric functions χ constitute one gravi-
tational degree of freedom. Moreover, the evolution equa-
tions of axial and polar modes have the same form. The
remaining metric functions, σ and ϕ are not arbitrary.
For instance one has

σ(η, r) = B(r) +

η

Zτ0

χ′(τ, r)dτ ;

(34)

the function B(r) that appears here is arbitrary, but if
one assumes that initially σ(η, r) vanishes, then B(r) =
0.

Only one of the above equations – Eq. (29) — disagrees
with [10], in the FLRW limit; we do not have a term
3H 2σ/2, which is present in equation (44) of [10].

The part of the perturbing metric that contains the
function ϕ represents a conformally ﬂat perturbation.
The evolution of ϕ is inﬂuenced by other metric polar
perturbation functions - σ and χ. We show that the
full set of equations is consistent and fully describes the
propagation of polar modes and the creation of inhomo-
geneities in the universe ﬁlled by perfect ﬂuid.

Assume p = KρΓ as the equation of state. Then the
s = ∂ρp and ∆ρ0 = Πp0/c2
speed of sound cs is given by c2
0.
Multiply both sides of Eq. (28) by 2a4p0/c2
0, and Eq. (27)
by 2a4ρ0 and subtract the obtained equations. After an
easy calculation one arrives at

This is a hyperbolic diﬀerential equation, whose initial
data — ϕ and ˙ϕ — are dictated by initial values of the
mass density contrast ∆ and the velocity (v) perturba-
tion. Indeed, one ﬁnds from Eq. (30)

2 ˙ϕ = 2v(η, r)a3(ρ0 + p0) + 2Hϕ + σ′ − ˙χ;

(36)

inserting that into Eq. (27) yields an ordinary diﬀer-
ential equation of second order onto the unknown ϕ. All
other data are known from the background geometry (H
and a) or from solving of the master equation (χ, ˙χ, χ′
and σ, σ′) . The appropriate boundary conditions are
ϕ′(r = 0) = 0 and ϕ(r = ∞) = 0.
If in addition the
initial mass density contrast ∆ is prescribed, then the
initial values of ϕ can be determined uniquely. The ini-
tial ”velocity” ˙ϕ is then obtained from the initial velocity
perturbation dictated by (36). These initial data for the
equation (35) give rise to an evolving solution ϕ ; this in
turn, determines in later times the mass density contrast
∆ and the pressure contrast Π.

Deformations of the velocity components w(η, r) and

v(η, r) are dictated by equations (29) and (30).

We would like to point out that the above reasoning
It suggests also that

proves consistency of equations.

even if initially density and velocity perturbations do
vanish, then they are expected to appear in later times.
Next subsection proves a stronger statement.

Polar waves inﬂuence cosmological matter

In the remainder of this Section we show, that if a
cosmological spacetime is nonvacuous, p0 ≥ 0 and
̺0 > 0, then propagating polar waves must disturb
the material medium. We shall use the method of
contradiction — assume that Π = ∆ = w = v ≡ 0 and
derive from that σ = χ = ϕ ≡ 0 — i. e., that polar
modes are absent.

The propagation equations (27) − (32) read, assuming

Π = ∆ = w = v ≡ 0:

at

Lemma 2. Eq. (50) does not possess nonzero solu-

Proof.
Indeed, let there exists two closest points r1 and r2
(r1 < r2) such that χ(r1) = χ(r2) = 0, and integrate 50)
over the interval (r1, r2). We arrive at

Let χ be strictly positive in the open interval (r1, r2).
Then necessarily χ′(r2)
f (r1) ; but that means that χ
monotonically increasing, which contradicts the assump-
tion that χ(r2) vanishes. In the same manner one con-
siders the case with χ being strictly negative in the open
interval (r1, r2). That ends the proof of the Lemma 2.

This allows us to conclude, that the vanishing of ma-
terial cosmological perturbations Π = ∆ = w = v ≡ 0
enforces the absence of polar gravitational waves, σ =
χ = ϕ ≡ 0.

This in turn means that travelling gravitational polar
pulses must leave inhomogeneous and nonisotropic tracks
in the cosmological background.

6

POLAR MODES IN THE DE SITTER UNIVERSE

In the de Sitter universe matter is absent, ρ0 = p0 = 0.
We have now six equations describing the propagation of
gravitational waves, while there are only two free initial
data, corresponding to the one degree of freedom car-
ried by polar modes. We show in this section that these
equations are consistent and that the whole dynamics is
described by the master equation.

The evolution equation (14) describing the background

geometry reads now

In the ﬁrst step we shall express equations (54), (55)
and (56) as linear combinations of the remaining three
equations (57) — (59). We assume that at some initial
time η0 the left hand side of Eqs. (56) does vanish.

One can check by straightforward calculation that

(55) = (59) + ∂r(58) − ∂η(57);

(60)

in the course of calculations we replaced ˙H, using Eq.
(52).

(53)

This identity can be derived from (52) — notice that H

It is clear that if (57), (58) and (59) are satisﬁed, then
equation (55) also holds. Eq. (56) is also satisﬁed modulo
a time-independent function, say f2(r); but now we use
the assumption that the velocity perturbation vanishes;
thus f2(r) = 0 and (56) is also valid.

We know, from the preceding analysis, that the right
hand side of (54) vanishes. Therefore (54) holds true
modulo a time-independent function f3(r); but f3(r) = 0,
since we assumed that the mass density and its pertur-
bation are absent. That means that (54) is valid.
In
summary, this reasoning shows that the only relevant
equations are (57) — (59).

In the second step one shows that metric functions ϕ
and σ can be derived from Eqs. (57) and (58). They be-
come functionally dependent on solutions χ of the master
equation — see explicit formulae in preceding sections —
modulo a time-independent function; but the latter can
be set to zero, with appropriate initial conditions. Thus
the whole dynamics reduces to the single master equa-
tion, as in the analysis by Zerilli of the propagation of
polar gravitational waves in the Schwarzschild spacetime
[9].

THE HUYGENS PRINCIPLE

We adopt the following version of the Huygens princi-
ple. Purely outgoing compact pulses of radiation, that at
η = 0 occupy a shell rin ≤ r ≤ rout obey, have to move
within space-time regions bounded by a pair of outgoing
null cones η = r + const. They should not leave any

tails trailing behind the main pulse. Analogous property
is obeyed by purely ingoing waves. Radiation shocks —
with initial data located strictly on a sphere — should
move strictly along null cones. Various versions are dis-
cussed in the monograph of Hadamard [12].

During the radiation epoch and assuming that Λ = 0,

where functions h and g depend on the combinations r−η
or r + η, respectively. The multipole index l exceeds 1 for
the wave-like solution. This solution obviously satisﬁes
the Huygens principle. Another argument for the validity
of the Huygens principle employs the conformal ﬂatness
of the FLRW models and conformal invariance of the
Maxwell equations in vacuum.

earized approximation — to matter inhomogeneities and
anisotropies. These latter must emerge in later evolu-
tion, even if matter is distributed isotropically and ho-
mogeneously at the initial hypersurface. We would like
to point out that this conclusion is consistent with the
study of C. Clarkson, T. Clifton, S. February [10].
It
is not clear to us whether this peculiar property of polar
modes has observational consequences. It is probably of
no signiﬁcance in local astronomical observations. It is
an open question, that would require the investigation of
(35) and related equations, whether primordial gravita-
tional waves can leave detectable imprints in the cosmic
microwave background radiation.

The Huygens principle is strictly obeyed by polar and
axial modes during the radiation epoch and broken in
other cosmological epochs. This breakdown eﬀect is
small when the ratio of the length-wave to the Hubble
radius is small ([7], [13]).

solutions of Eq. (63) [14].

In all remaining cases — when the dark energy (Λ 6= 0),
and/or nonradiational matter are present — the Huygens
principle is broken. That means that tail terms — de-
layed signals tracking the main wave pulse —- should
be present. This eﬀect depends, however, on the ratio
of the length-wave to the Hubble radius and it is weak
when this ratio is small [7] and [13]. This in turn im-
plies that it cannot be observed in present or presently
planned gravitational waves detectors.
