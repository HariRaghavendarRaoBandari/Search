To clarify the magnetic properties of cluster-glass states in Sr1−xLaxRuO3 (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.5), we report herein the re-
sults of muon spin relaxation (µSR) and neutron powder diﬀraction measurements. The µSR experiments showed that
magnetic clusters start developing well above the peak temperature T ∗ in the ac susceptibility. The volume fraction of
the magnetically ordered region increases continuously with decreasing temperature, showing no anomaly at T ∗, and
reaches nearly 100% at the lowest temperature. The temperature variation of the volume fraction is essentially inde-
pendent of the La concentration in the x range presently investigated, although the dc magnetization is signiﬁcantly
suppressed with increasing x. Neutron powder diﬀraction experiments revealed that the ground state for x = 0.3 is a
long-range ferromagnetic ordered state. These results indicate that, with decreasing temperature, cluster-glass states in
Sr1−xLaxRuO3 gradually develop into long-range ferromagnetic ordered states with decreasing temperature, and that the
magnetic ordering process diﬀers strikingly from that expected for a conventional second-order ferromagnetic transition.

1.

Introduction

In general, the 4d orbitals in 4d transition-metal oxides are
more delocalized than the 3d orbitals in 3d transition-metal
oxides; therefore, a conventional band picture is considered
a suitable starting point for understanding such 4d electronic
states. However, 4d transition-metal oxides exhibit a variety
of intriguing electronic properties, such as quantum critical-
ity,1, 2) non-Fermi liquid behavior,3) and unconventional su-
perconductivity.4) These intriguing electronic properties im-
ply that the correlation eﬀect of 4d electrons is important, and
that the electronic states are not trivial.

Although 4d transition-metal oxides rarely show magnetic
ordering, SrRuO3 exhibits ferromagnetic order below TC =
160 K, and the ordered moment is approximately 1.1 µB.5, 6)
This compound has a nearly cubic structure of the GdFeO3
type, which belongs to the space group Pnma. The electronic
structure has been studied by photoemission spectroscopy,
which revealed that the valence band spectra, which consist
of Ru 4d and O 2p states, are roughly reproduced by band-
structure calculations, and that the density of states at the
Fermi level is dominated by Ru 4d states.7–13) In addition,
the size of the ordered moment is well reproduced by band-
structure calculations.14) These results suggest that the ferro-
magnetic order of this material is caused by itinerant Ru 4d
electrons and can be described within the context of the band-
structure-based Stoner theory.

However, an incoherent feature reﬂecting electronic corre-

lation eﬀects is observed in the photoemission spectra. The
Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio pc/ps, where pc and ps are the para-
magnetic dipole moment deduced from the Curie constant
and the ordered ferromagnetic moment at zero temperature,
respectively, is estimated to be approximately 1.3.15) This
value is close to the localized-moment limit (∼1). The tem-
perature dependence of the nuclear spin-relaxation rate de-
viates from the prediction of the self-consistent renormaliza-
tion (SCR) theory for itinerant ferromagnets.16) Optical spec-
troscopy measurements have also shown that the charge dy-
namics diﬀers from that predicted by Fermi liquid theory.17, 18)
Moreover, angle-resolved photoemission, magneto-optic Kerr
eﬀect, and optical spectroscopy experiments reveal that the
ferromagnetic exchange splitting persists above TC; thus, the
presence of local moments has been suggested.19–21) These re-
sults reﬂect a localized character for the Ru 4d states. Based
on these results, it is considered that the itinerant and local-
ized characters coexist in this compound; this coexistence is a
fascinating aspect of this compound.

Solid solutions Sr1−xLaxRuO3 are of interest, since in-
creases in the Ru-O distance and the RuO6 octahedra rotation
by La doping change the electronic states and may enhance
the electronic correlation eﬀect.14, 22) Recently, we have stud-
ied the electronic and magnetic properties of Sr1−xLaxRuO3
by means of macroscopic measurements of the speciﬁc heat,
electrical resistivity, ac susceptibility, and dc magnetiza-
tion.23) We showed that the ferromagnetic order is strongly
suppressed with increasing La concentration x and that the
ordered state varies from ferromagnetic states to cluster-glass

states for x ≥ 0.3, demonstrating that spatially inhomoge-
neous magnetic states, which are indicative of the localized
character of Ru 4d states, occur for x ≥ 0.3. On the other
hand, we also revealed that this system is metallic and that the
density of states for conduction electrons at the Fermi level is
dominated by the Ru 4d states over the entire range of La con-
centration investigated (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5). Therefore, the itinerant
and localized characters seem to coexist also in this solid so-
lutions as in SrRuO3.

On the other hand, microscopic details of cluster-glass
states for x ≥ 0.3, which are very important for discussing the
nature of the Ru 4d states, still remain unclear. In the present
study, we have performed muon spin relaxation (µSR) and
neutron powder diﬀraction experiments on Sr1−xLaxRuO3 to
characterize the cluster-glass states at the microscopic level.
The µSR and neutron powder diﬀraction techniques are com-
plementary: the former technique provides information on lo-
cal magnetic ﬁelds and magnetic ﬂuctuations with extreme
sensitivity and allows us to evaluate the volume fraction of
magnetic clusters. In contrast, the latter technique provides
information on the magnetic structure and correlation length.

2. Experimental Details

Polycrystalline samples of Sr1−xLaxRuO3 with x = 0.3, 0.4,
and 0.5 were prepared by the conventional solid-state reaction
method. Details of the sample preparation and characteriza-
tion are given in Ref. 23. To estimate the ordering tempera-
ture and to characterize the magnetic properties of the present
samples, we measured the ac susceptibility and dc magneti-
zation using a commercial superconducting quantum interfer-
ence device magnetometer in the temperature range of 2 to
300 K. The µSR experiments were performed at the RIKEN-
RAL Muon Facility in the UK, where an intense pulsed
muon beam is available. The µSR spectra were collected un-
der zero-ﬁeld (ZF), longitudinal-ﬁeld (LF), and transverse-
ﬁeld (TF) conditions over a temperature range from 1.5 to
200 K in a He-ﬂow cryostat. The residual magnetic ﬁeld
was reduced to less than 50 mOe by cancellation coils in
the ZF-measurements. The forward and backward counters
are located upstream and downstream of the beam line, re-
spectively. The muon spin asymmetry as a function of time
is given by the expression A(t) = [N+(t) − αN−(t)]/[N+(t)
+ αN−(t)], where N+(t) and N−(t) represent the total muon
events counted at time t by the forward and backward coun-
ters, respectively. The calibration factor α represents the rela-
tive counting eﬃciencies of the forward and backward coun-
ters and was estimated from a µSR measurement with an ap-
plied TF of 20 Oe. The samples were glued onto a high-purity
silver plate and were tightly covered with a 25-µm-thick high-
purity silver foil to achieve good thermal contact. Any muons
implanted onto the silver plate contribute to the µSR spectra
in the form of a nearly time-independent constant background
in the ZF- and LF-experiments.

Neutron powder diﬀraction experiments were conducted
for x = 0.3 using the powder diﬀractometer Echidna at the
OPAL facility of the Australian Nuclear Science and Tech-

nology Organisation.24) The wavelength was set to 2.4395 Å
using a Ge (331) monochromator. Diﬀraction patterns were
recorded over the angular range 20◦ < 2θ < 164◦ and the tem-
perature range of 1.4-50 K. Approximately 10 g of the pow-
dered sample were contained in a 9-mm-diameter cylindrical
vanadium can, and the sample temperature was controlled by
a closed-cycle He cryostat.

slightly increases at 160 K, followed by further increases be-
low approximately 50 K. The increases below approximately
50 K would be related to cluster-glass ordering, whose mag-
nitude is markedly suppressed upon increasing x. The over-
all temperature dependence of the dc magnetization of the
present sample is very similar to that obtained in our previ-
ous study.23) The increases at 160 K are extrinsic and prob-
ably caused by an impurity ferromagnetic phase of the pure
SrRuO3. This is because its magnitude strongly depends on
the sample preparation process. The magnitude can be re-
duced by iterating the sinter process, although the magnetic
properties of the low-temperature cluster-glass phases depend
negligibly on the sample preparation process.23) In addition,
the present µSR results prove that the volume fractions are
negligible, and that the magnetic ﬁelds induced by the ferro-
magnetic impurity phase are static and are less than 1 Oe, as
we will discuss later. The in-phase component of the ac sus-
ac of the present samples measured at 180 Hz is
ceptibility χ′
shown in Fig. 2. χ′
ac exhibits broad peaks near 10 K. We here
deﬁne T ∗ as the peak temperature of χ′
ac, and the dependence
of T ∗ on La concentration is displayed in the inset of Fig. 2.
Although T ∗ depends negligibly on x, the amplitude of χ′
ac at
T ∗ is strongly reduced upon doping La. These features and
the T ∗ values are comparable to those obtained in our previ-
ous study.23)

In Fig. 3, we present the ZF-µSR spectra at selected tem-
peratures for x = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. The spectra are normal-
ized, and the signal from the silver sample plate has been sub-
tracted. For each sample, the relaxation becomes considerably
faster below 30 K. This behavior seems to be associated with
the development of magnetic clusters. For each sample, the
spectra above 30 K can be well ﬁtted by the following func-
tion:

P(t) =

1
3

exp(−λt) +

2
3

(1 − ∆t)exp(−∆t).

(1)

This functional form is based on a muon polarization function

in a static Lorentzian ﬁeld distribution.25) An exponential term
is multiplied to the ﬁrst term in order to incorporate the eﬀect
of magnetic ﬂuctuations, and the ﬂuctuation eﬀect on the sec-
ond term is absorbed into the parameter ∆. Therefore, λ de-
notes the relaxation rate that originates from the ﬂuctuations
of the internal magnetic ﬁelds, and ∆ denotes the relaxation
rate that is determined by the width of the static-ﬁeld distribu-
tion and the magnetic ﬂuctuations. In the analysis of the ZF-
µSR spectra, the ﬁtting functions are broadened to account for
the width of the pulsed muon beam (68 ns). The details of the
data analysis are described in Appendix. We found that the ef-
fect of the pulse width is negligible compared with the experi-
mental uncertainty in the entire time range where the ZF-µSR
spectra were measured (t ≥ 0.11 µs−1). A pronounced change
in the ZF-µSR spectra is observed for x = 0.3 above and below
160 K, which is the transition temperature of the impurity fer-
romagnetic phase.23) However, the initial asymmetry does not
decrease across this temperature; therefore, the volume frac-
tion of the impurity ferromagnetic phase should be negligible.
The λ value at 143 K for x = 0.3 is estimated to be extremely
small (1.7 × 10−2 µs−1), which shows that the internal ﬁeld is
nearly static. This is because the parameter λ reﬂects the mag-
netic ﬂuctuation eﬀect and is evidenced by the fact that Eq. (1)
reduces to a muon polarization function in a static Lorentzian
ﬁeld distribution if λ becomes zero.25) Thus, the impurity fer-
romagnetic phase merely creates a static weak ﬁeld distribu-
tion, whose full-width at half-maximum is about 0.4 Oe for
x = 0.3. The internal ﬁeld due to the impurity ferromagnetic
phase becomes much smaller for x = 0.4 and 0.5, as seen in
Fig. 3, so the impurity ferromagnetic phase should only neg-
ligibly aﬀect the magnetic properties of the low-temperature
cluster-glass phases, as we discussed in our previous paper.23)
Above 160 K, muon spin relaxation should be dominated by
ﬂuctuations of electronic spins and nuclear-dipole ﬁelds. For
each sample, the relaxation rate above 160 K is very small, as
seen in Fig. 3, suggesting that the eﬀect of the nuclear dipole

3

ﬁeld is also practically negligible.

For each sample, the ZF-µSR spectra below 30 K cannot be
well ﬁtted by Eq. (1) because of the development of magnetic
clusters. Therefore, we ﬁt the ZF-µSR spectra to the following
function, which assumes the presence of two components:

P(t) = A1[

1
3

exp(−λβ

1tβ) +

(1 − ∆1t)exp(−∆1t)]

2
3
2
3

+ A2[

1
3

exp(−λ2t) +

(1 − ∆2t)exp(−∆2t)],

(2)

where A1 and A2 represent the volume fractions of the mag-
netically ordered and paramagnetic regions, respectively, and
the total volume fraction (A1 + A2) is ﬁxed to unity. The expo-
nent β reﬂects the inhomogeneity of the magnetically ordered
region, and the ZF-µSR spectra below 30 K are satisfactorily
ﬁtted in the β range of 0.15 ≤ β ≤ 1, as shown in Fig. 3.
It is found that ∆1 is very large and exceeds 50 µs−1 below
T ∗, wheres ∆2, λ1, and λ2 are estimated to be several µs−1 or
less in the entire temperature range below 30 K. Thus, only
the second term in Eq. (2), which includes ∆1, shows a quite
rapid relaxation and becomes vanishingly small in the very
early time region (t ≤ 0.2 µs). This behavior allows us to esti-
mate the volume fractions A1 and A2 from the ZF-µSR spectra
at around t = 0.

Figure 4 shows the volume fraction of the magnetically or-
dered region V f = A1 as a function of temperature. The posi-
tions of T ∗ are indicated by arrows. We found that magnetic
clusters start to develop at approximately 30 K, which is well
above T ∗. Furthermore, the volume fraction increases contin-
uously with decreasing temperature, and for each sample, it
nearly reaches 100% at the lowest temperature. The volume
fraction exhibits no anomaly at T ∗, which is consistent with
the absence of any anomaly in the speciﬁc-heat data at T ∗.23)
Remarkably, the volume fraction shows no clear dependence
on La concentration despite the magnitude of dc magnetiza-
tion being signiﬁcantly suppressed with increasing x. This re-
sult contrasts sharply with the Sr1−xCaxRuO3 system, where

the development of the volume fraction of the magnetically
ordered region is continuously suppressed with increasing Ca
concentration over the entire range of Ca concentration.26)

As described above, ∆1 is signiﬁcantly larger than the other
parameters; hence, ∆1/γµ mainly represents the distribution
width of the local ﬁeld in the magnetically ordered region.
Here, γµ is the muon gyromagnetic ratio. However, in the
present study, we cannot correctly estimate ∆1 because it be-
comes too large, especially below T ∗; therefore, the second
term in Eq. (2), which includes ∆1, becomes vanishingly small
before initiating the data acquisition. On the other hand, be-
cause the volume fraction in each sample of the magnetically
ordered region is nearly 100% at the lowest temperature, the
magnitude of dc magnetization is expected to reﬂect the in-
ternal ﬁeld of the magnetic clusters; thus, the internal ﬁeld
appears to be signiﬁcantly suppressed upon increasing x.

We now focus on the dynamics of magnetic clusters. Be-
low T ∗, the ZF-µSR spectra are mainly dominated by the ﬁrst
term in Eq. (2), 1
1tβ), which describes the relaxation
process caused by magnetic ﬂuctuations in the magnetically
ordered region. Therefore, the functional form is mainly de-
termined by only two ﬁtting parameters, and we can safely es-
timate these parameters at low temperatures below T ∗. Here,
we introduce the relaxation time of muon spins as

This relaxation time is deﬁned as the time at which the ﬁrst
term in Eq. (2) reduces to half of its initial value and allows
us to compare the magnetic ﬂuctuation eﬀects of the spec-
tra ﬁtted with diﬀerent β values. The temperature dependence
of T ZF
increases with

decreasing temperature and exceeds the time range of µSR
experiments at the lowest temperatures, which implies that
at the lowest temperatures, magnetic ﬂuctuations caused by

We also performed µSR measurements under weak trans-
verse ﬁelds (WTFs), which provide an alternative method to
determine the volume fraction of the magnetically ordered
region. In WTF measurements, muon spins in the paramag-
netic region precess around the applied WTF at the Larmor
frequency, whereas muon spins in the magnetically ordered
regions yield no precession signal but instead exhibit a fast
depolarization due to the strong internal ﬁelds. Therefore, the
volume fraction of the nonmagnetic region can be estimated
from the amplitude of the precession signal. Figure 6(a) shows
the µSR spectra under a WTF of 20 Oe at selected tempera-
tures for x = 0.4. With decreasing temperature, the amplitude
of the precession signal decreases, which indicates the devel-
opment of magnetic clusters. We analyze the µSR spectra un-
der WTFs using the following function:

The third term is the contribution from the silver sample plate.
Figure 6(b) displays the temperature dependence of the vol-
ume fraction of the magnetically ordered region (1 - A2 - AAg)
/(1 - AAg). Here, we also plot the volume fraction estimated
from the ZF-µSR spectra (open symbols). The volume frac-
tions estimated from the WTF measurements are almost the
same as those estimated from the ZF-µSR spectra. Hence, this
result fully supports the validity of our analysis performed on
the ZF-µSR spectra.

(Color online) LF-relaxation rates at an applied ﬁeld of 200 Oe as

In order to gain further insight into the magnetic ﬂuctua-
tions of this system, we carried out µSR experiments at a LF
of 200 Oe for x = 0.4 and 0.5. The LF-spectra (not shown)
can be ﬁtted by a single exponential function A1exp(−t/T LF
1 ),
where 1/T LF
is the relaxation rate. Note that this relaxation
1
rate diﬀers from the relaxation rate 1/T ZF
1 estimated from the
ZF-µSR spectra: the former represents the eﬀect of magnetic
ﬂuctuations over the entire sample whereas the latter reﬂects
the eﬀect of magnetic ﬂuctuations only in the magnetically or-
dered region. In Fig. 7, we plot the relaxation rate 1/T LF
1 as a
function of temperature, with the positions of T ∗ indicated by
arrows. 1/T LF
exhibits divergent-like behavior near T ∗, im-
1
plying that the magnetic ﬂuctuations are considered to have a
critical character near T ∗. Thus, the µSR data show that the
peak in χ′
ac is related to the development of magnetic ﬂuctua-
tions rather than to the increase in the volume fraction of the
magnetically ordered region.

in
Sr1−xLaxRuO3, we performed neutron powder diﬀrac-
tion experiments for x = 0.3 over the temperature range

the magnetically ordered region is negligible according to
the µSR results. Hence, the contribution of the magnetic
scattering can be neglected. All
the observed diﬀraction
peaks [except for the peaks attributed to aluminum and an
unknown peak indicated by the blue arrow in Fig. 8(a)] are
indexed to the space group Pnma.

Figure 8(b) shows the temperature dependence of the (101)
and (020) reﬂections, which are expected to have the largest
magnetic contributions associated with ferromagnetic order.
The integrated intensity of these reﬂections as a function of
temperature is displayed in Fig. 8(c). The enhancement in the

6

integrated intensity appears only at the lowest temperature
(1.4 K), indicating the development of ferromagnetic order.
Note that no clear increase is observed down to 7 K, although
this temperature is less than T ∗, and the volume fraction of
the magnetically ordered region is approximately 80% at this
temperature. As seen in the diﬀerence plot between the 1.4
and 50 K neutron powder diﬀraction patterns, the peak width
of the magnetic reﬂection is comparable to the nuclear peak
width; thus, within the resolution of our measurements, the
ferromagnetic order detected at the lowest temperature is of
long range (≥1000 Å).

The ferromagnetic ordered moment must belong to a sin-
gle irreducible representation of the point group of this sys-
tem D2h.27) Therefore, the possible directions of the magnetic
moments are restricted to [100], [010], and [001]. However,
we cannot determine the direction of the magnetic moment in
this study because the magnetic reﬂections are too small and
because this system has a nearly cubic structure, which results
in overlapping of several diﬀraction peaks.27) Using the mag-
netic form factor of Sr2RuO4, we estimate the magnitude of
the ordered moment at 1.4 K to be approximately 0.5 µB.28)

4. Discussion

In the previous and present studies, we performed the
ac susceptibility, dc magnetization, µSR, and neutron pow-
der diﬀraction measurements on the cluster-glass states in
Sr1−xLaxRuO3.23) We obtained the following results: (1) T ∗
varies clearly with frequency, and the initial frequency shift
δ = ∆T ∗/(T ∗∆log10ω) is estimated to range from 0.040 to
0.084 for 0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.5. This result for δ is comparable to
that of cluster-glass systems. We also found that the frequency
dependence is well described by the Vogel-Fulcher law.29, 30)
(2) Magnetic clusters start to develop well above T ∗, and the
volume fraction of the magnetically ordered region gradually
increases with decreasing temperature without showing any
anomaly at T ∗ and reaches nearly 100% at the lowest tem-
perature. This development is expected to be responsible for
the increase in the dc magnetization at low temperatures. (3)
No clear dependence of La concentration on the temperature
variation of volume fractions is observed over the presently
investigated x range; however, the magnitude of the dc mag-
netization and ac susceptibility is markedly suppressed upon
increasing x. (4) No clear magnetic scattering is observed in
the neutron powder diﬀraction experiments for x = 0.3 down
to 7 K, which is below T ∗, and a long-range ferromagnetic or-
der is detected at the lowest temperature. The results (2) and
(4) obtained in this study are consistent with the cluster-glass
ordering, as discussed below, further supporting the presence
of the cluster-glass state in this system.

The results (1) and (2) clearly establish that the magnetic
ordering process for x ≥ 0.3 diﬀers signiﬁcantly from that ex-
pected for a conventional second-order ferromagnetic transi-
tion, and that the gradual development of the volume frac-
tion of the magnetically ordered region is consistent with
the cluster-glass behavior. Therefore, T ∗ is no longer a real
phase transition but rather a gradual freezing. Thus, although

J. Phys. Soc. Jpn.

DRAFT

critical-like magnetic ﬂuctuations are detected by the LF-
µSR experiments near T ∗, they cannot simply be understood
within the framework of the SCR theory for itinerant ferro-
magnets.31)

In the previous paper,23) we discussed the properties of the
cluster-glass states in Sr1−xLaxRuO3 based on the optimal
ﬂuctuation theory combined with a ﬁnite-size scaling tech-
nique.32) This theory assumes that the magnetic property of
a local region is characterized by the local La concentration
and the size of the local region. If we assume a random dis-
tribution of Sr and La, the probability that a small region con-
tains NLa number of La atoms can be calculated using the
binomial distribution P(NLa) = (cid:16) N
NLa(cid:17)xNLa(1 − x)N−NLa . Fur-
thermore, it is assumed that the small region has magnetic
order when its local La concentration xloc = NLa/N is less
than the threshold xc(LRR). The functional form of xc(LRR)
is given by xc(LRR) = x0
c − DL−φ
RR based on the ﬁnite size
scaling argument, where x0
c is the critical concentration for
the bulk system, D is a constant, and φ is the ﬁnite-size
shift exponent. This theory applies to the Sr1−xCaxRuO3 sys-
tem and successfully explains the dependence of the Ca con-
centration on the low-temperature dc magnetization data.33)
In Sr1−xLaxRuO3, however, the result (3) clearly contradicts
this assumption, suggesting that the properties of cluster-glass
states in Sr1−xLaxRuO3 cannot be explained simply in terms
of the distribution of La atoms in real space.

Interestingly, for x = 0.3, long-range ferromagnetic order is
detected by neutron powder diﬀraction measurements at 1.4
K. Here, we discuss the implications of this result. Accord-
ing to the µSR results, the magnetic clusters at x = 0.3 start
to develop at approximately 30 K and are considered to be
dynamically ﬂuctuating down to T ∗. Below T ∗, the magnetic
clusters seem to freeze in the time scale of the ac susceptibil-
ity measurement.23) The strong dependence T ∗ on frequency
detected by the ac susceptibility measurements clearly sug-
gests that the ordered states around T ∗ is a cluster-glass state,
which consists of short-range ferromagnetic clusters. Since
no anomaly appears in the ac susceptibility and dc magneti-
zation data below T ∗, the observation of long-range ferromag-
netic order at the lowest temperature implies that the magnetic
correlation length increases with decreasing temperature, and
that the cluster-glass state gradually changes to a long-range
ferromagnetic ordered state. The presence of the ferromag-
netic ground state is consistent with the rapid increase in T ZF
1
at the lowest temperatures. Thus, the absence of magnetic
contribution in the neutron powder diﬀraction pattern at 7 K,
which is below T ∗, may possibly be due to the magnetic corre-
lation length being too short to be detected by neutron diﬀrac-
tion experiments at this temperature. A similar crossover was
reported for the CeNi1−xCux system.34) For CeNi1−xCux, the
cluster-glass order is revealed by ac susceptibility measure-
ments as in Sr1−xLaxRuO3, and neutron diﬀraction studies
showed that the cluster-glass state continuously changes into
a long-range ferromagnetic state. However, the temperature
dependence of the volume fraction of magnetic clusters for

7

CeNi1−xCux diﬀers from that of Sr1−xLaxRuO3 and already
reaches 100% at T ∗.

5. Conclusions

The cluster-glass states of Sr1−xLaxRuO3 (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 0.5)
were studied by µSR and neutron powder diﬀraction mea-
surements. We found from the ZF- and TF-µSR experiments
that the volume fraction of the magnetically ordered region
starts to develop well above T ∗, and that it increases con-
tinuously with decreasing temperature reaching nearly 100%
at the lowest temperature, with no anomaly at T ∗. Although
the dc magnetization is strongly suppressed with increasing
x, no clear dependence of x on the temperature variation of
the volume fraction of the magnetic clusters is observed over
the presently investigated x range. The LF-µSR experiments
have shown that 1/T LF
exhibits divergent-like behavior near
1
T ∗, indicating a critical character of magnetic ﬂuctuations.
Long-range ferromagnetic order is detected by neutron pow-
der diﬀraction experiments for x = 0.3 at the lowest temper-
ature, whereas cluster-glass ordering below T ∗ is suggested
by the previous ac susceptibility and dc magnetization stud-
ies. The absence of any anomaly in ac susceptibility and dc
magnetization data below T ∗ implies that cluster-glass states
in Sr1−xLaxRuO3 gradually develop with decreasing temper-
ature into long-range ferromagnetic ordered states. These re-
sults suggest that the magnetic ordering process of the cluster-
glass phases in Sr1−xLaxRuO3 diﬀers strikingly from that ex-
pected for a conventional second-order ferromagnetic transi-
tion.

This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Sci-
entists (B) (Grant No. 25800211) from the Ministry of Educa-
tion, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan. The
neutron diﬀraction experiment was conducted with Echidna
at the OPAL facility of the Australian Nuclear Science and
Technology Organisation, using beam time that was trans-
ferred from HERMES at JRR-3 with the approval of ISSP,
The University of Tokyo, and JAEA.

Appendix: Analysis of µSR Spectra Considering Pulse

Width Eﬀect

The muon beam at the RIKEN-RAL Muon Facility has a
pulsed time structure determined by the time structure of the
primary proton beam. The width of a single muon pulse is
68 ns. Since the limited time resolution caused by the pulse
width may aﬀect µSR spectra, it is necessary to take into ac-
count its eﬀect in the analysis in order to obtain reliable ﬁtting
parameters.

Here, we derive the asymmetry of the pulsed µSR AP(t)
from the asymmetry of the conventional µSR A0(t). The
positron counts at the forward and backward counters N+(t)
and N−(t) in the conventional µSR experiment can be written
as

(A·1)
where τµ = 2.2 µs is the muon lifetime. Therefore, A0(t) is

In the present study, we approximate the time structure of the
muon beam bµ(t) by a Gaussian function with a full width
at half-maximum of 68 ns. We analyzed the ZF-µSR spectra
using the above functional form and found that the eﬀect of
pulse width is negligible in the present analysis.
