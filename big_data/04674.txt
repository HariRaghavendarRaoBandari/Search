Abstract. Comparison of the ISM properties of a wide range of metal poor galaxies with
normal metal-rich galaxies reveals striking diﬀerences. We ﬁnd that the combination of the low
dust abundance and the active star formation results in a very porous ISM ﬁlled with hard
photons, heating the dust in dwarf galaxies to overall higher temperatures than their metal-rich
counterparts. This results in photodissociation of molecular clouds to greater depths, leaving
relatively large PDR envelopes and diﬃcult-to-detect CO cores. From detailed modeling of the
low-metallicity ISM, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant fractions of CO-dark H2 - a reservoir of molecular gas
not traced by CO, but present in the [CII] and [CI]-emitting envelopes. Self-consistent analyses
of the neutral and ionized gas diagnostics along with the dust SED is the necessary way forward
in uncovering the multiphase structure of galaxies.

1. Introduction

Dwarf galaxies, often carrying signatures of chemical youth, are unique laboratories
to obtain insight on star formation and interstellar medium (ISM) properties in low-
metallicity environments that may be relevant to understanding early universe conditions,
when metal abundances were very low. The decrease of metals reduces shielding eﬀects
which have important consequences, for example, on the molecular gas reservoir, which,
in turn, should aﬀect how we observe the ISM properties. Our knowledge in this subject
has been growing at a fast pace due to the increasingly sensitive infrared (IR) space
missions IRAS, ISO, Spitzer, AKARI and Herschel, as well as ever-growing powerful
ground-based millimeter (mm) and submillimeter (submm) telescopes. The Dwarf Galaxy
Survey (DGS; Madden et al. 2013), has compiled a large observational database of 48
low-metallicity galaxies, motivated by Herschel PACS (Poglitsch et al. 2010) and SPIRE
(Griﬃn et al. 2010) photometric and spectroscopic observations covering 55 to 500 µm.
These data, together with the ancillary database, create a rich legacy for dust and gas
analyses in unprecedented detail in low-metallicity galaxies from ultraviolet (UV) to mm
wavelengths in environments covering the largest metallicity range achievable in the local
Universe, as low as ∼1/40Z⊙(R´emy-Ruyer et al. 2013; 2015). Here we describe enigmatic
issues surrounding the nature of the dust and gas properties in low-metallicity galaxies.

2. Metallicity eﬀects on dust properties and gas-to-dust mass ratios

2.1. Dust spectral energy distributions and dust temperatures

The dust spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the DGS galaxies and the Herschel
KINGFISH survey, consisting of mostly metal-rich galaxies (Kennicutt et al. 2011; Dale
et al. 2012) have been modeled by R´emy-Ruyer et al. (2015) using the model of Galliano et
al. (2011). This complete, consistently modeled sample consists of 109 galaxies combined,
covering almost 2 dex in metallicity, making it a valuable sample to investigate the eﬀects
of metallicity on the SED shape and the dust properties.

Low-metallicity galaxies tend to have higher average starlight intensity (< U >) and
broader SED peaks (σU) shifted to shorter wavelengths compared to the more metal-rich
KINGFISH galaxies (Fig. 1, left), as a result of their high star formation activity. This
is reﬂected in the overall dust temperatures (Td): the low-metallicity galaxies span a
broader range in temperature and a higher mean Td of 26 K, in contrast to the higher-
metallicity KINGFISH galaxies which span a narrower temperature distribution and a
lower mean Td of 20 K (R´emy-Ruyer et al. 2013; 2015). A trend of increasing Td with
decreasing metallicity is likewise observed. Also seen in Fig. 1 (right) is the trend of
increasing < U > and σU with increasing sSFR showing that the sSFR is the parameter
controlling the dust SED shape, while we observe a weaker correlation of < U > and σU
with metallicity, placing metallicity in a secondary role in shaping the observed SED.
The DGS galaxies contain a wider range of warmer dust, primarily due to their intensive
star formation activity, not necessarily due to the fact that they are low metallicity. The
secondary eﬀect of the low metallicity is reﬂected in the higher Td. The consequence of
the lower dust attenuation is the heating of the dust deeper into the molecular clouds.

or the wider distribution of the starlight intensities (σU). Metallicity is decreasing from the
metal-rich galaxy, NGC0628, to the metal-poor galaxy, SBS1415+437. (right) Broadening of
the SED (σU) as a function of average starlight intensity (< U >) for the DGS + KINGFISH
galaxies. The color-code is the speciﬁc star formation rate (sSFR) of the sources. Notice that the
low-metallicity dwarf galaxies tend to have higher < U > and higher σU (broader dust SEDs)
while the more metal-rich KINGFISH galaxies tend towards lower sSFR values, lower < U >
(lower Td), and narrower SEDs (see R´emy-Ruyer et al. 2015 for more details).

2.2. Gas-to-dust mass ratio versus metallicity

With dust masses accurately and consistently measured for 109 DGS plus KINGFISH
galaxies over the full MIR to submm wavelength range and covering a broad metallicity
range, it is now possible to characterize the impact of metallicity on the gas-to-dust mass
ratio (G/D) over almost 2 dex range of metallicity (Fig. 2, left; R´emy-Ruyer et al. 2014).

IAU 315 Low Metallicity Dwarf Galaxies

We observe a broad degree of scatter over all metallicities and a steep rise in the
G/D for the lower-metallicity galaxies for which 12 + log (O/H) . 8. This behavior
is found to be consistent with chemical evolution models that require grain growth in
the ISM as a source of dust production as well as episodic star formation history (e.g.
Zhukovska et al. 2014; Asano et al. 2013). Dust production becomes more eﬃcient when
enough metals can accumulate, and this occurs in the observations and models at around
12 +log (O/H) ∼ 8. Normalizing the dust mass by the stellar mass gives us a view of
how the dust mass builds itself up as a function of the stellar mass. Previous studies
of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio of mostly rather metal-rich galaxies (e.g. da Cunha et
al. 2010; Skibba et al. 2011; Cortese et al. 2012) have shown that the dust-to-stellar
mass ratio decreases for increasing stellar mass (or metallicity) and decreasing sSFR. We
extend the dust-to-stellar mass ratio studies to lower-metallicity, low-mass galaxies with
our DGS galaxies and we do not ﬁnd any correlation for the dust-to-stellar mass ratio
with metallicity or sSFR over the full sample. The results for only the more metal-rich
KINGFISH galaxies are in agreement with the ﬁndings of previous studies. However, the
low-metallicity sample does not extend the same behavior of the metal-rich galaxies to
higher sSFR. Instead we see a wide scatter in dust-to-stellar mass ratio for the DGS
galaxies and a very low dust-to-stellar mass ratio for some of the lowest metallicity (high
G/D) galaxies (Fig. 2, right). The diﬀerent behavior of the dust-to-stellar mass ratios for
the low-metallicity DGS galaxies can be explained by their chemical evolutionary stage,
also traced by the G/D (R´emy-Ruyer et al. 2014). The evolutionary tracks of the chemical
evolution model of Asano et al. 2013 (Fig. 2) show a turnover with the scatter related to
various star formation time scales (τ ) and star formation histories. Dust growth processes
saturate when all the available metals are locked up in the grains. In the meantime, star
formation continues, consuming the gas reservoir and increasing the stellar mass. This
results in increasing the sSFR, decreasing the dust-to-stellar mass ratio and decreasing
the G/D. The prominent non-linearity of the G/D vs metallicity at low metallicity, as
well as the wide degree of scatter, even for the metal-rich galaxies, call for caution when
attempting to determine the total gas mass from the dust mass with an assumed G/D
simply scaled linearly with metallicity.

3. The FIR ﬁne-structure lines reveal a porous ISM structure

The DGS galaxies were surveyed in the most important FIR ﬁne-structure lines, such
as 158 µm [CII], 63 and 145 µm [OI], 88 µm [OIII] and more rarely, due to sensitivity
limits, 57 µm [NIII], 122 and 205 µm [NII] (see Madden et al. 2013 and Cormier et al. 2015
for more details of the DGS observations). These important cooling lines are diagnostics
probing the FUV ﬂux, the gas density and temperature, and the ﬁlling factor of the
ionized gas and photodissociation regions (PDRs; e.g. Wolﬁre et al. 1990; Kaufman et al.
2006; Le Petit et al. 2006). The photoelectric eﬀect is normally the dominant source of gas
heating in PDRs and [CII] usually ranks foremost in the PDR cooling lines in galaxies,
followed by the 63 µm [OI]. Thus the [CII]/LF IR ratio, or ([CII]+ [OI]/LF IR, indicates
the eﬃciency of photoelectric heating. Fig. 3 (left) shows the ([CII]+ [OI])/LF IR ratio as
a function of LF IR. The ratios of dwarf galaxies are higher than those of galaxies in other
surveys of mostly metal-rich galaxies. These relatively larger eﬃciency factors, from 1%
to 2%, can be a consequence of relatively normal PDR gas densities (often on the order of
103 to 104 cm−3) and low average ambient radiation ﬁelds over full galaxy scales (Cormier
et al. 2015). Note, in contrast, the FIR line deﬁcit seen in the most luminous sources (e.g.
Luhman et al. 2003; Gracia-Carpio et al. 2011; Diaz Santos et al. 2013; Farrah et al. 2013)
where dustier HII regions are present leading to a high ionization parameter on global
scales. On the other hand, the 88 µm [OIII] line, requiring an ionization energy of 35 eV,
is the brightest FIR cooling line in almost all of the dwarf galaxies (Cormier et al. 2015)
- not the [CII] line, as in the normal-metallicity galaxies. While higher stellar eﬀective
temperatures in the low metallicity star-bursting dwarf galaxies already can account
for elevated [OIII] line emission compared to more metal-rich stellar atmospheres (e.g.
Hunter et al. 2001), the predominance of the [OIII] line demonstrates the ease at which
such hard photons can leak out of the medium surrounding stars and traverse the ISM
on full galaxy scales (see also Cormier et al. 2012; Lebouteiller et al. 2012).

The dwarf galaxies also show extreme [CII]/CO ratios (Fig. 3, right): while most normal
star-forming galaxies are observed to have [CII]/CO ∼ 1 000 to 4 000, the low-metallicity
galaxies can reach much higher ratios - up to an order of magnitude higher, or more,
in [CII]/CO over galaxy-wide scales (e.g. Madden 2000; Cormier et al. 2014). Elevated
L[C I I]/LF IR and L[C I I]/LCO(1−0) values as seen above, seem to be attributed to the
eﬀects that are unique to the low-metallicity and clumpy ISM: a consequence of the
lower dust abundance and a longer mean-free path of the FUV photons which penetrate
molecular clouds, photodissociating the CO and leaving a relatively larger [CII]-emitting
envelope surrounding a small CO core. This is consistent with the fact that we see such
luminous 88 µm [OIII] line emission over full galaxy-wide scales, and rarely can detect
signiﬁcant CO line emission. The decreased attenuation and the presence of intense,
hard radiation ﬁelds, together facilitate the photodissociation of the molecular clouds,
highlighting the diﬀerent nature and structure of the ISM of low-metallicity galaxies.

4. H2 mass in dwarf galaxies and the CO-dark gas

While CO is routinely used to trace the H2 reservoir in local as well as high-z galaxies,
its utility can be called into question for dwarf galaxies, which are notoriously deﬁcient
in CO (e.g. Schruba et al. 2012; Cormier et al. 2014 and references within), leaving us
with large uncertainties in quantifying the molecular gas mass, and compounding the
diﬃculty in understanding the process of both local and global star formation in low-
metallicity environments. This road block is necessary to overcome in order to reﬁne
recipes for converting gas into stars under early-universe conditions and thus further our

understanding of how galaxies evolve. We are left with the question: where is the bulk
of the fuel for the obvious star formation taking place in many of the dwarf galaxies?

While extreme observed [CII]/CO values of the dwarf galaxies suggest very active star
formation, many of the dwarf galaxies are thought to be HI-rich rather than H2-rich. The
fact that their molecular gas reservoirs remain uncertain renders their location on the
Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram ambiguous. Depending on how the total gas surface densities
are determined (from HI, HI+H2, CO, dust, or HI+H2-modeled) several star-forming
dwarfs deviate from the Schmidt-Kennicutt correlation with elevated star formation rates
compared to their gas masses (Fig. 4; Cormier et al. 2014).

The lower dust abundance in dwarf galaxies allows the CO molecular clouds to be
subjected more easily to photodissociation by UV photons, making the detections of
the smaller CO cores with single-dish telescopes diﬃcult. H2, on the other hand, is
photodissociated by absorption of Lyman-Werner band photons. These bands become
optically thick at modest AV values and the H2 becomes self-shielded. This self-shielding
eﬀect can leave a potentially signiﬁcant reservoir of H2 in the [CI] and [CII]-emitting
regions, outside of the CO core (e.g. Roellig et al. 2006; Wolﬁre et al. 2010; Glover et
al. 2012). This is the CO-dark molecular gas and the [CII], [CI] and/or other FIR ﬁne-
structure lines, may have the capability to trace this “missing” molecular gas that is not
probed by CO. This dark gas reservoir was ﬁrst uncovered in a few low-metallicity galaxies
using [CII] (Poglitsch et al. 1995; Israel et al. 1996; Madden et al. 1997), but Herschel
has now increased the sample with deeper sensitivity. More recently [CII] observations
of the Milky Way have found that on average the fraction of CO-dark gas, compared to
the total H2 can be as high as ∼ 30% (Pineda et al. 2013).

Determination of their true source of the molecular gas reservoir requires more than CO
observations, which have proven to not be a reliable tracer of the total H2 gas reservoir.
The MIR and FIR ﬁne-structure lines have recently been modeled for each galaxy of the
DGS survey to quantify the predicted total H2 reservoir determined from the best-ﬁtted
model (Cormier et al. in prep). This is then compared to the H2-determined from the CO

the Schmidt-Kennicutt relationship (dotted line with power index of 1.4), while some remain as
outliers to the right and some to the left of the relationship (see Cormier et al. 2014 for more
details). (right) The CO-dark H2 gas mass /H2 determined from CO alone versus the observed

observations, the diﬀerence being the CO-dark H2 (Fig. 4, right). The mass fraction of
CO-dark gas / H2 traced by CO, spans at least 4 orders of magnitude. The contribution
of the CO-dark gas is greatest under conditions of the lowest AV environments as well
low values of density and radiation ﬁeld which correlate with higher [CII]/LF IR rates
(with large scatter). Calibrating this empirically is work in progress. While we ﬁnd that
both [CII] and [CI] do indeed trace the CO-dark gas under the conditions we ﬁnd for
the dwarf galaxies, we also ﬁnd that [CI] traces more of the CO-dark mass than [CII]
(Madden et al. in prep) making observations of the submm [CI] lines potentially the most
valuable tracer of the CO-dark gas (see also Glover et al. 2015).

To obtain greater detailed comprehension of the photodissociation of molecular clouds
in the vicinity of a massive star cluster within a low-metallicity galaxy, Chevance et al.
(2015, submitted) have studied the spatial variation of the ISM properties surround-
ing the R136 cluster in our nearest low metallicity galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud.
Modeling the suite of MIR and FIR Herschel and Spitzer ﬁne-structure emission lines
(Fig. 5, left) has uncovered a signiﬁcant dark-gas reservoir, where more than 80% of the to-
tal H2 is not traced by CO in the highly porous environment of 30 Doradus (Fig. 5, right),
demonstrating the value of the [CII] and [CI] lines.

5. Way forward: modeling complexities of the low-metallicity ISM

With the wealth of tracers of the galactic phases present today, it is the challenge to
determine the local physical conditions within galaxies and to relate them to the global
properties. With the wide range of MIR and FIR cooling lines available from Spitzer and
Herschel, for example, we are now able to model the physical conditions of the various
phases of the gas and dust over full galaxy scales as well as spatially within galaxies. In

µm; Green: [NeII]12.8 µm; Blue: PACS [CII]158 µm. The blue contours outline the limit of the
[CII] map. The diﬀerent layers of the gas from the highly ionized medium near the star cluster
R136 (image center with dark hole), to the PDR regions (blue), are evident (Chevance et al.
2015, submitted). (right) Fraction of the CO-dark gas calculated by comparing the predicted
H2 column density from PDR modeling to the H2 derived from CO(1-0) observations. The
color code is the CO-dark fraction which is > 80% throughout, with red the largest fraction of
CO-dark gas. The size of the circles indicates the total H2 mass, between 50 and 500 M⊙ pc−2.

this way we can obtain a more accurate prescription of the role of metallicity and star
formation activity in governing the evolution of galaxies.

Using limited MIR and FIR gas diagnostics to deduce the conditions for star formation
and the structure of the galaxy is eﬀectively averaging ensembles of PDRs and physically
diﬀerent gas phases mixed within a telescope beam. The challenge in moving forward
with interpretation is to cover a range of diagnostics having varying critical densities and
ionization potentials, to be able to characterize the dense and diﬀuse ionized gas and
neutral atomic and molecular gas which have very diﬀerent ﬁlling factors even for the
range of dwarf galaxies Herschel has surveyed. Analysis of these various phases compris-
ing galaxies cannot be done without considering the gas and dust tracers together. An
example of one of the most thorough analysis that has been approached, given the wide
selection of diagnostics for any one galaxy, is demonstrated in Cormier et al. (2012) with
∼20 FIR ﬁne-structure lines and CO observations as well as the photometry constraints
to model the full SED of Haro 11. While this galaxy was not resolved with the obser-
vations, the self-consistent photoionization and photodissociation modeling was able to
determine the mass fraction and ﬁlling factor of the diﬀerent ISM phases. This is the
approach that is necessary now with the existence of many observational constraints.
To go beyond this relatively simple, yet novel multiphase model though, including more
realistic geometries, will really make that signiﬁcant leap forward.

6. Conclusion

From studies of the MIR and FIR gas properties and MIR to submm dust properties,
a picture of the structure of low-metallicity galaxies is emerging. The decreased atten-
uation and the presence of intense, hard radiation ﬁelds conspire together to highlight
the unique place the low-metallicity star-forming galaxies take compared to their more

metal-rich counterparts. The porosity of the ISM linked with the star formation activity
in dwarf galaxies, accounts for the extreme [OIII]/[CII] and [CII]/CO. Much of the ISM
is ﬁlled with hard photons which, due to the decrease in global dust attention, allows the
permeating hard photons to heat the dust to higher temperatures, and ﬁll a relatively
large volume of the galaxy and successfully photodissociate CO clouds eﬀectively, making
single-dish CO observations challenging. We ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant reservoir of H2, not
traced by CO (the CO-dark gas), can exist and is traceable by [CII] and [CI].
