NOON states play the important roles in quantum information processings and quantum metrology, but the
ﬁdelities of these states generated previously are limited typically by the practically-unavoidable decoherence
and operational imperfections. Here, we propose an efﬁcient scheme to generate photonic NOON states alter-
natively by rapid population passage technique via shortcut to adiabaticity (STA), rather than the usual Rabi
oscillations. Since the deterministic population passages based on the STAs are insensitive to details of the
operations and can be implemented as fast as the Rabi oscillations, the ﬁdelity of the generated NOON state
could be satisfactorily high. The feasibility of the proposal is demonstrated speciﬁcally with the experimental
circuit QED systems by rapidly driving two artiﬁcal qutrits.

Introduction.—It is well-known that quantum entanglement
lies at the core of quantum physics. In particular, the so-called

NOON states |ψi = (|N 0i + eiφ|0Ni)/√2 (with arbitrary

phase φ and N = 0, 1, 2, ...) have drawn more and more
attention [1–13], due to their potential widely applications
in quantum precise measurements [1–3], quantum lithogra-
phy [4], quantum information processings [14], and quan-
tum communication [15], etc.. Especially, with the NOON
states [1–3] the precisions of certain measured quantities can
be greatly improved from the standard quantum limit 1/√N
to the Heisenberg limit 1/N . However, the experimental gen-
erations the desired NOON states with satisfactorily high ﬁ-
delities for these applications is still a challenge.

So far, two approaches have usually being utilized to create
the NOON states; post-selected measurements based beam-
splittings for traveling photons and rapid Rabi oscillations
in solid-state systems. Theoretically [5], the ideal photonic
NOON states with arbitrary N can be generated by employ-
ing the interference of a classical coherent light and a quantum
light produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion
(SPDC) through a 50 : 50 beam splitter. However, in prac-
tice, the ﬁdelities of the generated photonic NOON are lim-
ited by the ﬁnite setup transmission coefﬁcient η and thus are
always less than unit, e.g., 72.1% NOON state with N = 4
for η = 0.11 [6]. Alternatively, the NOON states can be gen-
erated by quantum state population engineering [7–13]; using
the rapid Rabi oscillation to implement sequentially the popu-
lation transfers from the initial ground state 00 to the expected
NOON state with N > 0. However, due to the inevitable de-
coherence and the imperfect operations, the ﬁdelities of the
generated NOON by this approach are still very limited; typ-
ically, e.g., 33% of the N = 3 NOON state for the stand-
ing wave photons in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED)
system [16, 17]. Therefore, it is greatly hope to ﬁnd a new
approach to generate the desired high-ﬁdelity NOON states.

Given the ﬁnite coherence time of the current manipulat-

able quantum system is always limited, a potential scheme to
generate the high-ﬁdelity NOON state could be achieved by
optimizing the population transfers, e.g., realizing the rapid
population passages deterministically via decreasing various
operational imperfections. Although the Rabi oscillation (RO)
technique has being used widely to rapidly control the popu-
lation transfers between the selected quantum states, the ﬁ-
delities of these transfers are quite sensitive to any parame-
ter ﬂuctuations; the integral area and the frequency variation
of the applied pulses. While, the so-called adiabatic popu-
lation passage (APP) technique [18–21] is insensitive to the
details of the operational pulses, but the adiabatic condition
required in this technique limits practically the ﬁdelities of
the implemented population transfers. In order to overcome
such a difﬁculty, in this letter we propose a modiﬁed scheme
to generate high-ﬁdelity photonic NOON states determinis-
tically by using the shortcut to the adiabaticity (STA) tech-
nique [22–28]. We ﬁnd that, by applying certain suitable addi-
tional counter-diabatic ﬁelds, the desired NOON states for two
standing wave ﬁelds in two cavities could be generated rapidly
beyond the adiabatic limit. It is shown that the high-ﬁdelity
for each population passages for the desired generation is sig-
niﬁcantly higher than that by RO technique. Speciﬁcally, our
proposal is demonstrated with the experimentally-existing de-
vices, i.e., the circuit QED system, by driving two interacting
three-level atoms.

Robust generation of photonic NOON states via STA
technique.— We consider a quite generic model, i.e., two
coupled ladder-type three-level atoms (called hereafter as the
qutrits 1 and 2, respectively) interact respectively with two
individual cavities a and b. As a beginning, we assume that
two cavities are cooled to their vacuums and the two qutrits
stay at their ground states, i.e., the initial state of the system
is |g1g20a0bi. Then the desired NOON state of the cavities
can be implemented generically by the following population
transfers:

∗E-mail: weilianfu@gmail.com

i)Keep the states the cavities unchanged but drive the qutrits

into the Bell state, i.e., the state of the system becomes as

|ψ0i =

1
√2

(|ei1|gi2 + |gi1|ei2) ⊗ |0a0bi,

(1)

ii)Transfer the population of the excited state |ei of each
qutrits into its auxiliary state |fi, keeping the states of the
cavities still unchanged. This let the state of the two qutrits
become 1√2
(|fi1|gi2 + |gi1|fi2). iii) Swap the population of
the auxiliary state of each qutrits to the coupled cavity, and
evolve the system to the state

|ψ1i =

1
√2

(|ei1|gi2|1ia|0ib + |gi1|ei2|0ia|1ib).

(2)

iv) Repeat the above steps N − 1 times, and then return the
qutrits to their ground states. This evolves ﬁnally the system
to the state [8]

|ψNi =

1
√2|gi1|gi2(|Nia|0ib + |0ia|Nib),

(3)

with the desired photonic NOON state of the two cavities be-
ing generated.

The generation demonstrated above seems quite trivial and
can be simply implemented by the usual RO technique. Be-
side the usual decoherence of the system which needs to in-
crease the quantum quality of the system essentially, the rele-
vant ﬁdelity is limited mainly by the following operational im-
perfections: a) the frequency deviations of the target resonant-
RO pluses and b) the imprecisions of the integral area of the
applied pulses due to the ﬂuctuations of the strengths and du-
rations of the pulses. This is the reason that the ﬁdelity of
the NOON state generated previously by the RO technique
is quite ﬁnite. In principle, these difﬁculties could be effec-
tively overcome by the replacing the RO pluses by the APP
ones [18–20], which keeps always the system in the instanta-
neous eigenstates |λn(t)i of the time-dependent Hamiltonian
H(t) of the driven system. By properly setting the parame-
ters of the pulses the designed population passages can be im-
plemented deterministically [18–20], as long as the relevant
adiabatic conditions are satisﬁed robustly. Physically, the adi-
abatic condition implies that the population passage desired
above should be sufﬁciently slow (as any nonadiabatic tran-
sition inﬂuences the passage ﬁdelity), but the duration is still
required to be shorter signiﬁcantly than the ﬁnite decoherence
time of the system. Fortunately, with the help of the STA [22–
26], such a contradiction can be solved. The key point of
STA is to add an auxiliary counter-diabatic ﬁeld to avoid any
potential non-adiabatic transition during the above adiabatic
process. In fact, the required counter-diabatic ﬁeld can be de-
signed by various methods, e.g., the transitionless driving al-
gorithm [22–24], counterdiabatic control protocols [25], and
Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants theory [26], etc.. For example,
with the transitionless driving algorithm [22], one can apply a

counter-diabatic driving H1(t) = iPn(|∂tλn(t)ihλn(t)| −
hλn(t)|∂tλn(t)i|λn(t)ihλn(t)|) to robustly keep the system
H(t) at its instantaneous eigenstate |λn(t)i without any un-
wanted transition to all the other instantaneous eigenstates
{|λm(t)i, m 6= n}. Based on this idea, we show below how

2

to generate NOON states with two cavities by coupling them
to two manipulatable qutrits, i.e., implementing the operations
i) to iii) demonstrated above. The Hamiltonian of the system
originally reads ( = 1)

H = Hq + Hr + Hi,

(4)

with Hr = ωaa†a + ωbb†b and Hq = Pi=1,2 ωg
i |giihg|i +
i |eiihe|i + ωf
ωe
i |fiihf|i) + g12|g, eihe, g| + g′12|e, fihf, e| +
H.c. being respectively the Hamiltonians of the cavities and
qutrits, and

Hi = Xi=1,2

(gi|giihei| + g′i|eiihfi|)a†i + H.c.,

(5)

the qutrit-cavity interactions with a1 = a, a2 = b. For sim-
plicity, the qutrit-qutrit interacting strength g12 and the qutrit-
cavity coupling one gi, g′i are assumed to be tunable.

First, to perform the i) operation, i.e., prepare the two
qutrits in the Bell states, by the STA technique, we switch
off the qutrit-qutrit and qutrit-cacity couplings and then de-
terministically excite one of the qutrits. For example, a time-
dependent driving

H1(t) =

[Ω1(t)(|ei1hg|1 + |gi1he|1) + 2∆1(t)|ei1he|1],

is applied to the qutrit 1.
If the two pulses Ω1(t) and
∆1(t) are chosen properly to tune the mix angle θ1(t) =
arctan[Ω1(t)/∆1(t)]/2 from zero to π/2, then the state of the
system is driven from the state |g, g, 0, 0i to the |e, g, 0, 0i. In
order to eliminate all the possible diabatic transitions during
such a process, an additional driving

H′1 =

Ω′1(t)(i|ei1hg|1 − i|gi1he|1),
with Ω′1(t) = [Ω1(t) ˙∆1(t) − ˙Ω1(t)∆1(t)]/[Ω2
1(t)]
is required to apply simultaneously. Many pluses,
typi-
cally the usual Allen-Eberly (AE) drivings [29]: Ω1(t) =
Ω0sech(πt/2t0), ∆1(t) = (2β2t0/π) tanh(πt/2t0), can be
used to rapidly implemented such a process beyond the adia-
batic limit. Now, we want to rapidly swap the population of
the qutrit 1 to qutrit 2. Note that the qutri-qutrit interacting
Hamiltonian reads writes

1(t) + ∆2

H2(t) =

+ 2∆12(t)|g, eihg, e|], ∆12(t) = ω′1 − ω′2

(8)

in the invariant space {|e, gi,|g, ei}. Thus, one can choose
the proper pulse series, e.g.,

g12 = G0 exp(−(t − τ )2/T 2
0 ),
∆2 = ∆0 exp(−(t + τ )2/(mT0)2),

(9)
(10)

to tune the mix angle θ2(t) = arctan[g12/∆12(t)]/2 from
zero to π/4. After this process, the state of system will adi-
abatically evolve from the state |e, g, 0, 0i to the Bell state
1√2
(|e, g, 0, 0i + e(iφ)|g, e, 0, 0i), with the removable phase

factor φ. Again, in order to avoid the possible adiabatic tran-
sition during this population trasfer, a counter-diabatic driving

H′2(t) =

(11)

with J(t) = [g12(t) ˙∆12(t)− ˙g12(t)∆12(t)]/[g2
12(t)]
should be applied simultaneously. Given the interaction
strength between the two qutrits should be real, such a driving
can not be realized directly. However, this difﬁculty can be
solved by applying a z-rotation [24]

Here, Js(t) = pJ 2(t) + g2

12(t) is real and ∆s(t) = ∆12(t)−
Next, we transfer the populations of the qutrits to the two
cavities for generating the NOON state. To do this, we switch
off the qutrit-qutrit coupling and apply the counter-diabatic
driving

to the qutrits simultaneously. After this, the state of the two
qutrits reads
(|f, g, 0, 0i + |g, f, 0, 0i). Then, we swap
the populations of the qutrits to the respectively coupled res-
onators. For example, to implement the population of the state
|f1i to the resonator a, we apply the driving

H41(t) =



[g′1(t)(|ei1hf|1a† + |fi1he|1a)

(15)

and set the mixing angle θ4(t) = arctan[g′1(t)/∆ef
1a(t)]/2 to
be changed from zero to π/2. Note that a counter-diabatic
driving

1a(t)]/[(g′1(t))2 +

the potential non-adiabatic transition. The difﬁculty of the
coupling strength in this auxiliary driving being not real can
be similarly solved by applying the following transformation

state |g, gi, i.e., the inverse operation of the previous one for

Demonstrations with superconducting circuit devices.—
The previous proposal is quite generic and can be demon-

(|e, g, N, 0i + |g, e, 0, Ni),(19)

strated with various cavity quantum systems. A promise can-
didate is the circuit quantum electrodynamical system with
tunable qutrit-qutrit and qutrit-cavity interactions. The de-
signed device is schematically shown in Fig. 1, wherein two
cavities are coupled together by a gmon [30–32] generated
by using tunable-coupling qutrits (TCQs) [33–35] to replace
the usual transmons. Here, each of the TCQs can also be
treated as a three-island transmon described by the Hamil-
tonian HT = P±
[4EC±(n± − ng±)2 − EJ± cos(ϕ±)] +
4EI n+n−. Here, n+(−) and ng+(−) represent the number
of Cooper pairs and offset gate charge in the upper (lower)
island, ϕ+(−) are the relevant phase differences; EC±, EJ±
and EI represent the charge-, Josephson- and interaction en-
ergy, respectively. In fact, the TCQ can be further modeled
as two coupled anharmonic oscillators with annihilation op-
erators c± under the condition EJ±/EC± ≫ 1, and thus

with ω± = p8EJ±EC±/ − EC±/, δ± = −EC±/ and

ζ = ω+−ω−−(δ+−δ−)/2, and θ = π for ζ > 0; θ = π/2 for
ζ < 0. Physically, the TCQ described above acts as a V -type
qutrit formed by the levels (see Fig. 1(c)): |gi = |0i+|0i−,
|ei = ˜c†+|gi, and |ai = ˜c†
−|gi. Note that the formal qutrit-
cavity coupling strengths ˜g± = g± cos(λ) ∓ g∓ sin(λ) can
be frequency-independent, and only the parameter ˜g+ can be
tuned to zero due to the negative J [33]. Thus, the transi-
tion between |gi and |ei can be utilized to excite the cou-
pled resonator. Given the coupling between the distant qutrits
mediated by an auxiliary cavity demonstrated in the previous
conﬁguration [8] is typically weak, implying the relative-long
operational durations, we alternatively introduce a tunable
Josephson junction to generate an sufﬁciently-strong inter-bit
coupling S(θ)ϕ1−ϕ2−. The present coupling strength S can
also be tuned by modulating θ, the phase difference across the
coupling junction. Speciﬁcally, S(θ)ϕ1−ϕ2− = g12(θ)(c†

of the qutrit 1 and 2, respectively. The last step is due to the
usual rotating wave approximation. Consequently, the tun-
able qutrit-qutrit coupling g12(t)(|g, aiha, g| + |a, gihg, a|)
desired similarly in Eq. (8) can be obtained.
We now show how to demonstrate the deterministic gen-
eration of the NOON state with the above superconducting
circuit. As the present qutrit is V -type, rather than the ladder-
type qutrits used in our generic proposal described in the
last section, the procedure for the generation of the desired
NOON state should be slightly changed as: a) |g, g, 0, 0i →
|a, g, 0, 0i → 1√2
(|g, a, k, 0i +
|a, g, 0, ki) → 1√2
(|g, a, k +

(|g, ai + |a, gi)⊗ |0, 0i; b) 1√2

(|g, a, N, 0i+|a, g, 0, Ni) → 1√2|g, gi⊗(|N, 0i+|0, Ni).
1√2
The effectiveness of such a procedure is veriﬁed by our nu-
merical simulations. For example, in Fig. 2(a) and (d) we
show the population transfer: |g, g, 0, 0i → |a, g, 0, 0i, could
be deterministically realized by using the Hamiltonian Eq. (6)
with the relevant counter-diabatic driving Eq. (7). In the ﬁg-
ures the relevant parameters are chosen as t0 = 1ns, Ω0 =
2π × 60MHz, and β = 2π × 80MHz. One can see that, the
desired population passage is performed almost perfectly with
signiﬁcantly-high ﬁdelity and the passage duration is less than
6 nanoseconds. Also, Fig. 2(b) and (e) show how the Bell

state (|g, a, 0, 0i + |a, g, 0, 0i)/√2 could be prepared deter-
ministically by using the Hamiltonian (13), with parameters
T0 = 5ns, G0 = 2π×10MHz, ∆0 = 2π×30MHz, m = 1.25,
and τ = 4ns. Note that the present duration is nearly 16ns re-
stricted mainly by the maximum of the inter-qutrit coupling
strength which was measured as 2π × 55MHz for the demon-
strated gmon [30]. Finally, Fig. 2(c) and (f) show how to
swap the population from the qutrit to the resonator by us-
ing the Hamiltonian (18) in 5ns, with parameters T1 = 1ns,
G1 = 2π × 90MHz, and β′ = 2π × 100MHZ.
We now investigate the ﬁdelity of the above generations
with the parameter variations. Without loss of the general-
ity, we focus the last part in the step b) as this step has been
repeat several times for the desired NOON state generation.
Again, we use the AE drivings: g′1(t) = G1sech(πt/2T1),
and ∆ge
1a(t) = (2β′2t0/π) tanh(πt/2T1), and the parameters
G1 is changed from 60MHz to 160MHz, and T1 is changed
from 0.5ns to 4ns. With these common drivings we compare
the ﬁdelities of the population passages by the STA-, the APP-
and the RO techniques in Fig. 3, respectively. It is shown that
the STA technique can achieve high-ﬁdelity in any case but
the APP one only works well for the sufﬁciently-long pro-
cess time. Of course, the RO technique works only with a
π/2 pulse integral area. This indicates that the STA technique
delivers more robustness with signiﬁcantly-high ﬁdelity for a
common duration.

Conclusion and Discussions.— In conclusion, we theoreti-
cally demonstrate that the photonic NOON states between two
cavities can be deterministically generated by using the STA
technique. Due to the duration of such a generation is signiﬁ-
cantly shorter than that by the APP, and also more robustness
than that by the usual RO to the ﬂuctuations of the pulse pa-
rameters, the ﬁdelity of the NOON state generation should be
sufﬁciently high and feasible.

The generic proposal has been demonstrated speciﬁcally
with the experimental superconducting circuits. In order to
speedup the generation for a deﬁnite coherent time we used
the gmon conﬁguration to realize the direct controllable qutrit-
qutrit interaction and the tunable qutrit-cavity couplings. Typ-
ically, all the coupling strengths in our device conﬁguration
are tunable independently, and thus some dispensable cou-
plings can be effectively switched off. For example, once
the Bell state has been prepared, the inter-bit coupling can be
tuned to zero so that the system divides to two qutrit-resonator
subsystem. More importantly, only two excited states of the
V -type atom are used in our experimental demonstrations, and

|a, g, 0, 0i)/√2; (c) and (f), |e, a, k, 0i to |a, e, k + 1, 0i. Here, (a), (b) and (c) are the operated drivings, with (a) the AE drivings Ω1(t) (solid
blue line, left axis) and ∆1(t) (dash green line, left axis), and the counter-diabatic driving Ω′
1(t) (dot-dash red line, right axis); (b) coupling
1a(t) (dash
strength Js(t) (solid blue line) and frequency detuning ∆s(t) (dash green line); (c) STA drivings: g ′
green line). (d), (e) and (f) are the relevant population transfer in the STA process, where the solid blue lines denote the population of the state
|g, g, 0, 0i, |a, g, 0, 0i and |e, a, k, 0i, and the dash green lines denote the population of the state |a, g, 0, 0i, |g, a, 0, 0i and |g, a, k + 1, 0i,

thus the stronger decoherence of higher levels should not in-
ﬂuence the ﬁdelity of the proposed NOON state generation.
Hopefully, the scheme for generating the desired NOON state
with high ﬁdelity can be directly used in various quantum

metrology applications.
