Abstract

We consider the diphoton excess observed by ATLAS and CMS using the most up-to-date data

and estimate the preferred enhancement in the production rate between 8 TeV and 13 TeV. Within

the framework of eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT), we then show that for both spin-0 and spin-2 Stan-
dard Model (SM) gauge-singlet resonances, two of the three processes S → ZZ, S → Zγ, and
S → W W must occur with a non-zero rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that these branching ra-

tios are highly correlated in the EFT. Couplings of S to additional SM states may be constrained

and diﬀerentiated by comparing the S production rates with and without the vector-boson fusion

(VBF) cuts. We ﬁnd that for a given VBF to inclusive production ratio there is maximum rate

of S to gauge bosons, b¯b, and lighter quark anti-quark pairs. Simultaneous measurements of the

width and the VBF ratio may be able to point towards the existence of hidden decays.

INTRODUCTION

First data at the 13 TeV LHC hint to the existence of a diphoton resonance, S, with a mass
mS ∼750 GeV [1–5]. Because S decays to two photons, S → γγ, one generically expects
that S also decays to the other gauge boson pairs: S → ZZ, S → Zγ, and S → W W .
The aim of this manuscript is to make this generic expectation more precise and to consider

implications of couplings to other Standard Model (SM) states.

We begin our discussion by performing an up-to-date ﬁt of S to the available data (after

Moriond EW 2016). We quantify the enhancement of the production cross section between

the 8 TeV and 13 TeV LHC runs implied by the current data. The large preferred en-

hancement can be interpreted as a preference for heavy quark annihilation or gluon fusion

dominated production.1 Accordingly, we extract the preferred diphoton signal strengths for

various possible production modes.

One of our central results is that, within our working assumptions, at least two out of
three branching ratios, S → ZZ, S → Zγ, and S → W W , need to be nonzero if the
resonance is a SM gauge singlet.2 Our working assumptions are: (1) that the resonance S

is either a spin-0 or spin-2 particle, and (2) that eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT) may be used

to describe the interactions of S with the SM. Implicitly, this means that we can truncate

the EFT after the ﬁrst few lowest dimension operators. In our case, we keep systematically

all the terms up to and including operators of dimension 6.

If the mixing of S with the SM-Higgs and its coupling with the Higgs kinetic mixing can
be neglected, two branching ratios (e.g., S → ZZ and S → W W ) are predicted in terms
of the third one (in this case, S → Zγ). If S mixes with the Higgs, then measuring two
branching ratios out of three, S → ZZ, S → Zγ, or S → W W , predicts the third. Below,
we derive the sum rules relating these branching ratios. While the importance of these decay

modes has already been stressed in the literature [6, 9–27], we phrase the discussion directly

in terms of observables, making contact with the experiments very explicit.

Determining the dominant production channel(s) of the resonance is paramount as more

sections c.f. [6–8].

2 We also show that the branching ratios are constrained if S is part of an SU (2)L doublet or triplet
representation; in general, we ﬁnd that in the EFT framework at least one of the additional branching
ratios to electroweak gauge bosons needs to be non vanishing.

data accumulates. Towards that end, we consider the simultaneous measurements of the

rate after applying vector boson fusion (VBF) cuts along with the total width. This can

distinguish between diﬀerent production channels and help resolve whether hidden decays

are required. For example, we show that the ratio of the rates with and without applying

VBF cuts is an eﬃcient discriminator between gluon fusion and heavy quark production.

Furthermore, for a given VBF ratio there is a maximum allowed rate to electroweak gauge
bosons and quark pairs (excluding t¯t); measuring a rate beyond this value may indicate
decays to a hidden sector or to currently relatively unconstrained ﬁnal states, such as t¯t.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we present an updated ﬁt of the resonance

to the most recent ATLAS and CMS 13 TeV and 8 TeV analyses. In Sec. III we introduce

the EFT interactions of S to the SM particles, assuming S is either spin-0 and spin-2. In

Sec. IV we derive the correlations between branching ratios of S to diﬀerent EW gauge boson

pairs. Section V discusses the importance of searching for the potential VBF production

of S, while Sec. VI considers the implications of simultaneous measurements of the VBF

production rate and the total width. We conclude in Sec. VII.

II. FIT TO THE CURRENT DATA

We start our discussion of the diphoton excess by performing a χ2 analysis of the current

publicly available ATLAS and CMS data. Our analysis addresses the following questions:

(i) What is the signiﬁcance of the excess after combining all publicly available ATLAS

and CMS data? (ii) What is the preferred production channel for S? (iii) What is the

compatibility between the 8 TeV and 13 TeV data sets? (iv) What is the preferred diphoton
production cross-section, σγγ ≡ σ(pp → X)13BRγγ, at 13 TeV?

The production mechanism of S is presently unknown. Some handle on it can be obtained

already now, though, by comparing the LHC data collected at the 8 TeV and 13 TeV center

of mass energies. For this purpose, we examine the dependence of the current experimental

results on the ratio between the 8 TeV and the 13 TeV S production rates

R13/8 ≡ σ(pp → S)13
σ(pp → S)8

.

(1)

Examining the compatibility between the two sets of measurements gives valuable infor-

mation on the production mechanism because diﬀerent parton luminosities scale diﬀerently

with collider energy.

In our analysis we include the 8 TeV and 13 TeV diphoton searches, including the Moriond

EW 2016 updates, by ATLAS [2] and CMS [4, 5] and distinguish between the narrow and

ments and construct a χ2 as function of R13/8. For CMS and narrow-width approximation
we use the reported χ2 functions, χ2

where Rref

hypothesis, ΓS/mS ∼ 0.06, CMS does not provide the χ2 functions directly. However, we
can construct a quadratic χ2 functions based on the public p-value distributions for 8 TeV

and 13 TeV. These are described by two parameters each, the two minima and the two

curvatures.

Similarly, for ATLAS results the χ2

using the quoted signiﬁcance of the excess for the 13 TeV and 8 TeV analyses, the com-

patibility of the two, and the global minimum χγγ. The ﬁrst three inputs are provided in

[2] except for the narrow width case where the signiﬁcance of the 8 TeV data (re)analysis

is not provided. We estimate this by ﬁtting the signal to a single mγγ bin. Such a narrow

resonance ﬁt to a binned distribution might not faithfully represent the maximal signiﬁcance

of the constraint. In order to be conservative, we also consider the three bins nearest to mS

and employ the weakest constraint in the combination ﬁt.

background) number of events in the i-th bin and σi the corresponding estimated uncertainty.

Signal is modeled using a normalized Breit-Wigner resonance function centered at mS with
a width ΓS, whose integral over the i-th bin is given by Ri. Finally, i is the corresponding
signal eﬃciency for the 8 (13) TeV analysis. ATLAS presented two analyses with diﬀerent

cuts on the transverse energies of the photons. In the following, we employ the “spin-0”

analysis which requires pT (γ1(2)) > 0.4 (0.3)mγγ. While it contains only a subset of data

passing the cuts of the “spin-2” analysis, it exhibits a slightly more signiﬁcant excess and

reduced tension with the 8 TeV results. Using MadGraph 5 [29] simulations we estimate the
signal eﬃciency to be i (cid:39) 0.65 (0.40) close to mγγ ∼ mS for a spin-0 (spin-2) resonance S.
The obtained spin-0 eﬃciency is consistent with the range quoted in [2].

gives the signiﬁcance of the excess. We plot ∆χ2

sig in Fig. 1 assuming a spin-0 S with either
a narrow (left panel) or wide decay width (right panel). At present the diﬀerence between

spin-0 and spin-2 hypotheses is negligible, so that we do not plot the corresponding results

for spin-2. The vertical lines in Fig. 1 indicate R13/8 ratios expected for diﬀerent production

mechanisms, computed using the NLO NNPDF 2.3 [28] pdf set. The excess becomes more

signiﬁcant for larger values of R13/8, i.e., for larger ratios of 13 TeV to 8 TeV production

cross sections.

This feature can be seen also from the compatibility of the 8 TeV and 13 TeV datasets,

which can be assessed through

∆χ2

comp = χ2(R13/8) − χ2

min .

(6)

Here χ2

min is the minimum of χ2(R13/8) when varying R13/8. The dependence of ∆χ2

comp on
R13/8 is shown in Fig. 2. Since the signiﬁcance of the excess in the 8 TeV data is much

smaller than for the 13 TeV measurements, the ﬁt prefers a large enhancement of the 13 TeV

production rates compared to 8 TeV. The above may be interpreted as a preference for having

sea partons (gluons or heavy quarks) as initial states. These predict higher R13/8 ratios,
R13/8 (cid:38) 5. In contrast, R13/8 (cid:46) 3(4) if S is produced through valence quark annihilation or
photon fusion [17, 24, 30–33] which is disfavored by more than 3 (2) σ for a narrow (wide) S.

In the following we will consider these results as indicative but keep the possibility of valence

quark annihilation and photon (or more generally EW vector boson) fusion dominated S

production open. The results for spin-0 and spin-2 are, again, very similar.

band. The vertical lines indicate diﬀerent production mechanisms computed using NLO NNPDF

2.3 [28] pdf set. Left (Right): for narrow (wide) width hypothesis; Up (Down): for spin-0 (2).

Finally, we combine the ATLAS and CMS data to estimate the preferred value for the

cross section σγγ. We use the combined χ2 (2), (3) to ﬁnd the 1σ band as function of R13/8.

The results are presented in Fig. 3. Note that the best-ﬁt cross section grows larger as

the ratio R13/8 increases. In Tab. I we summarize the best-ﬁt 13 TeV diphoton rates, σγγ,

for a number of assumed production mechanisms. In Tab. I we take the eﬃciencies, i, to

be independent of the production mechanism. The errors due to this approximation are

expected to be subleading compared to the current sizable experimental uncertainties and

the limitations of our ﬁtting procedure. For the spin-0 case one can understand the smallness

of these eﬀects most easily by noting that the photon pT distributions are boost invariant

In the subsequent sections we will also make use of experimental constraints on the

III. EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORY FRAMEWORK

We setup an EFT description of the interactions between S and the SM ﬁelds. Our

discussion partially overlaps with and extends previous results presented in [6, 9–25]. We

make two choices for the spin of S. We start with the spin-0 scenario and assume that

S is either an SU (2)L singlet or triplet, commenting also on the possibility that S is an

electroweak doublet. The resulting phenomenology is quite similar also in the case where S

has spin-2, which we cover next. In all cases we consistently keep all the terms up to and

including dimension 6 and comment on eﬀects at higher powers.

have been computed in [6] using the NLO NNPDF 2.3 [28] pdf set.

A. Spin-0, SU (2)L singlet

We ﬁrst consider the case where S is a gauge singlet spin-0 particle. Assuming CP

invariance, the remaining choice is whether S is a scalar or a pseudo-scalar. At the level of

observables the diﬀerences between these two scenarios are small. We begin with the scalar

case and later mention how the pseudo-scalar case diﬀers.

The only renormalizable interactions of the scalar S with the SM are through the Higgs

doublet ﬁeld H,

L(4)
int = −µSSH†H − λS

S2H†H.

√
where in the unitary gauge H = (0, v + h)/
2, with v = 246 GeV. We will see below that
the dimensionful parameter µS is required to be small, µS (cid:46) v, in order not to induce too
large of a mixing between S and the Higgs, h. For simplicity, we assume that the scalar

(13)

potential for S does not introduce a vacuum expectation value for S. If this is not the case,
one can simply shift S → S − (cid:104)S(cid:105), and then appropriately redeﬁne the coeﬃcients in the
SM and the interaction Lagrangians.

down-type quarks, up-type quarks, and leptons. In general, the coeﬃcients λd,u,(cid:96) are 3 × 3
complex matrices, where we do not display the dependence on the generational indices.

However, since we are considering the CP conserving case, λd,u,(cid:96) are assumed real. The

normalization of the operators in the ﬁrst line of (14) reﬂects the expectation that they

are induced at 1-loop level. The cW = cos θW and sW = sin θW terms in the denominators
ensure that the parameters λB and λW do not contain the loop factors g(cid:48)2/16π2 = α/4πc2

After electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), the µSSH†H term in (13) and the
λHS(H†H)2/mS term in (14) lead to the mixing between S and h. In terms of the mass
eigenstates, h(cid:48), S(cid:48), we have h = cαh(cid:48) + sαS(cid:48), S = −sαh(cid:48) + cαS(cid:48), where the mixing angle is

The couplings of S to the SM fermions arise from the mixing with the Higgs and from

dimension-5 operators in Eq. (14). The couplings to up quarks are thus given by

operators can in principle be ﬂavor violating, though such terms are tightly constrained [42].

B. Spin-0, SU (2) doublet

Another interesting possibility is that S is one of the neutral components of a SU (2)L

doublet with Y = 1/2 hypercharge. The scalar can in general mix with the SM Higgs

Hermiticity ensures that the λi coeﬃcients are real. The leading operators that may generate
decays of H 0 (A0) to electroweak gauge bosons are O3 and Oa

The parameter controlling the decays to longitudinal W and Z, κ, is unrelated to the

above parameters, mirroring the singlet discussion. Note that, in this case, the couplings

of S to electroweak gauge bosons have one additional parameter compared to the SU (2)L

singlet scenario. This means that given two of the above couplings, the other two may be

determined.

C. Spin-0, SU (2) triplet

In this sub-section we introduce the eﬀective Lagrangian assuming that the 750 GeV

resonance is the charge-neutral component, S, of an SU (2) triplet, TS. For simplicity we
set the hypercharge to YT = 0, so that S is accompanied by two charge-1 components, T ±
S .
The leading TS = T i

Sσi interactions with the SM are of dimension three and four,

L(3)
T = µT H†TSH ,
L(4)
T = λ1H†T 2

S H + λ2H†H Tr(cid:0)T 2

S

(cid:1) .

The dimensionful parameter, µT , induces a VEV for TS and is tightly constrained by EWPTs,
µT /v < 1.6 % [43, 44]. Consequently, its contribution to the TS → hh decay rate is negligible.
The λ1,2 terms lead, after EWSB, to a universal mass shift of all TS components. The charged
T ±
S state is thus almost degenerate in mass with S. The S–T ± mass splitting comes from
the small mixing of S with the higgs, (39), and from dimension six operator (H†TSH)2 .

The couplings of TS to SM gauge bosons and fermions start at dimension ﬁve,

It can be easily veriﬁed that the number of independent parameters is suﬃcient to completely
de-correlate S (and T ±) decay rates to various EW gauge boson ﬁnal states.

For the triplet with YT = 1 there is one renormalizable operator, H†HT

STS. First
nonrenromalizable interaction occur at dimension 7 where there are three operators of the

form Tr(H T TSH)BµνBµν, Tr(H T TSH)Tr(WµνW µν), (TSH)i(WµνH)iBµν. The analysis is

thus similar to the case of the S being part of the electroweak doublet.

The resulting relations among the S decay amplitudes and rates to EW gauge bosons are

exactly the same as in the scalar case discussed in Sec. III A. Also similar is the generaliza-

tion of the above results to higher SU (2)L representations of S (modulo diﬀerent Lorentz

contractions), although these are arguably less motivated from the theory perspective in the

spin-2 case.

IV. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN DI-BOSON FINAL STATES

The observation of the 750 GeV resonance, S, decaying to two photons generically implies
that it should also decay to other pairs of electroweak bosons, S → W W, ZZ, Zγ. The
branching ratios for these decays are correlated, if the EFT expansion can be truncated

at leading order. Some of these correlations have been discussed by authors focusing on

loop-induced dimension-5 operators or in the context of a speciﬁc model [10, 22]. Our

only assumption is that that the EFT described in section III is valid and then phrase the

correlations directly in terms of observables.

We start with the case where S is an electroweak singlet that does not couple to the Higgs,

µS = λS,H = 0. In this limit there is no S–h mixing and the mixing angle (15) vanishes,

sα = 0. It is then easy to rewrite the relations (18)–(20) purely in terms of observables—the

moduli of the decay amplitudes. We deﬁne the normalized decay amplitudes as

(cid:115)

Af ≡ ±4

πΓf
mSFf

,

(48)

where Ff are the small phase space correction factors due to massive ﬁnal state particles,

Fγγ : FγZ : FZZ : FW W = 1 : 0.99 : 0.89 : 0.91.

We work in the EFT limit where all the NP states that generate the dimension 5 operators

in Eq. (14) are oﬀ-shell when running in the loop. The contributions from SM fermions

are small. The only potentially signiﬁcant contribution is from the top running in the
loop, but even this is always sub-leading. The ratio of S → t¯t decay width, Γt¯t, and the

16

S → γγ rate induced entirely due to top quarks running in the loop, (Γγγ)t¯t, is (Γγγ)t¯t/Γt¯t (cid:39)
5 × 10−6 [6, 45, 46]. Using the bound from direct searches for S → t¯t at 8 TeV, Γ(S →
t¯t)/Γ(S → γγ) (cid:46) 300, shows that the contribution to the S → γγ rate from the top loop
is always below O(10−3) and thus negligible. Due to chiral ﬂip suppression, the b and light
quark contributions to S → γγ are also always negligibly small, even if S → b¯b or S → 2j
were to saturate the total decay width, ΓS. In the limit where we can neglect top-quark
contributions, the S → γγ decay amplitude and the S → ZZ, Zγ, W W decay amplitudes are
all real. Namely, the coeﬃcients λB,W are real, while there are also no CP even (“strong”)

phases from intermediate on-shell states. The decay amplitudes are thus determined up to

a discrete choices of either a positive or a negative sign, as denoted in Eq. (48).

One can now identify three amplitude sum rules relating Aγγ to AγZ, AZZ and AW W

independent of the underlying parameters (λB,W ) of the theory

It is clear that a non-vanishing Aγγ implies that decays to at least two other ﬁnal states
should occur. If one additional Af is measured or is tightly constrained, the remaining two
rates are accurately predicted. Eqs. (49)–(52) are valid in the limit of vanishing κ and are
correct for the transverse modes of the decay amplitude. For κ (cid:54)= 0, the decay branching
ratios to ZZ and W W will get contribution from the decay amplitudes to the longitudinal

modes of the W and the Z. Both of these are controlled by one additional parameter, κ.

Next, we move our discussion to the level of branching ratios, allowing κ (cid:54)= 0. The rates

The ratio RZγ = BRZγ/BRγγ is controlled by a single parameter,

(58)

(59)

Note that κ (and thus rκW ) can be nonzero even in there is no mixing between S and the

Higgs. Measuring two out of three ratios of branching ratios ﬁxes the two parameters, rBW
and rκW . For instance, a measurement of RZγ ﬁxes rBW , up to a two-fold ambiguity. A
measurement of either RZZ or RW W then determines rκW , which means that the remaining
ratio of branching ratios is fully predicted.

This is illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. In Fig. 4 we show the correlations for the κ = 0
limit (see also Ref. [10]). In this case all three ratios, RZγ, RZZ, RW W , depend only one
parameter, rBW . This we trade for RZγ and show RZZ, RW W as functions of RZγ. Current
collider data imply RZγ (cid:46) 3.5 (8 fb/σγγ), see Eq. (12) above, from which we ﬁnd

RZZ (cid:46) 19 − 6.3 ,

RW W (cid:46) 68 − 20 ,

(60)
assuming σγγ = 2 − 10 fb. For large σγγ values, these bounds are thus comparable to the
8 TeV constraints from Eqs. (7)-(10).

It is possible that one of the decays, S → ZZ, W W, Zγ has vanishing branching ratio. It
is, however, impossible for two of them to vanish simultaneously. For instance, for vanishing
S → Zγ, RZγ = 0, one has RZZ = 1 and RW W = 2. If RZZ = 0, then RZγ ≈ 1.2 and
RW W ≈ 0.37 or RW W ≈ 12. For RW W = 0, one has RZγ ≈ 0.6 with either RZZ ≈ 0.09
or RZZ ≈ 2.9 . We conclude that in the limit of κ = 0 at least two of the ratios should
deviate from zero, in accordance with amplitude sum rules in (49)–(52). For RZγ (cid:39) 1 the
two remaining ratios, RZZ and RW W , are suppressed, see Fig. 4 right. Nevertheless, the
RZZ and RW W are never zero simultaneously. Finally, note that establishing upper bounds

RZZ,W W (cid:46) 0.4 and RZγ (cid:46) 0.2,

corresponding values of rBW . For each RZγ there are two solutions for RZZ,W W , shown by the
lower and upper curves. We denote the lower (upper) curves as branch 1 (branch 2).

would exclude the κ = 0 case.

Next, we discuss the general case keeping κ (cid:54)= 0. In Fig. 5 we show contours of RW W
in the RZγ − RZZ plane. There is a two-fold ambiguity when solving for RW W in terms
of RZγ − RZZ. The two panels in Fig. 5 show the two solutions for RW W , which we call
branch 1 and branch 2. We see that when RZγ = 0 both RZZ and RW W need to be nonzero.
Similar conclusions apply if RZZ = 0 or RW W = 0. This means that even for κ (cid:54)= 0 at least
two of the ratios, RZγ, RZZ, and RW W , need to be nonzero.

We re-emphasize that the above correlations between diﬀerent di-boson ﬁnal states rely

on a valid EFT expansion. The assumption is that one can truncate the EFT at dimension

5 operators, while higher orders are neglible. It is possible, for instance, to have a positive

signal only in the diphoton channel, if the interactions of S with the EW gauge ﬁelds are

mediated by a dimension 9 operator,

dimensional operators that we were discussing so far. If only a diphoton signal is observed

with no indication of decays to other di-boson states, this would signal a breakdown of EFT.

Note that our conclusions apply also to the case where S is a pseudo-scalar. The eﬀective
interaction with the SM gauge ﬁeld are given in Eq. (23). The diﬀerent ratios, RZγ,ZZ,W W
are all controlled by one ratio of parameters, ˜λB/˜λW . The discussion is thus the same as in
the case of a scalar S, but with κ = 0. Therefore, the correlations shown in Fig. 4 also hold

for the pseudoscalar case.

At this point it is instructive to consider whether these conclusions derived for the case of

a SU (2)L singlet S can be invalidated if S is part of a larger weak multiplet. If S is one of the

neutral states of a doublet (HS), the leading interactions with SM gauge bosons arise purely
from the S − h mixing. Additional interactions of S with gauge bosons arise at dimension
6, as shown in (34). Through dimension 6, there are ﬁve relevant parameters that go into
determining the 3 ratios RW W , RZZ, and RZγ. These are λW , λB, λ(cid:48)
B, sin α, and an analog
H singlet term, arising from a dimension 6 operator ∼(HDµH)2. However, it may
of the λ(cid:48)
be veriﬁed that—just as in the singlet case—sin α and λ(cid:48)
H only enter into the ratios in the
form of a single parameter κ. When κ = 0, then it may be seen directly through (35)-(37)

20

that there is not enough freedom to set more than two of ratios to zero. That is, in addition

to Γγγ, at least one of the other electroweak ﬁnal states must be non-vanishing. A direct
analysis shows that this conclusion is not changed when κ (cid:54)= 0, in analogy to the singlet
case.

More interesting is the case of a SU (2)L triplet (TS) with hypercharge YT = 0 or ±1.
Consider for concreteness YT = 0, where its interaction with the SM (up to mass dimension 5)

are given in Eqs. (39)–(41). As we can see the leading interaction between TS and EW gauge

boson is controlled by only one parameter, λW B. This means that the branching ratios to
S → ZZ, Zγ, W W are all uniquely predicted in terms of the BRγγ. The corresponding
couplings in (53)–(56) are given by

λγ : λγZ : λZ : λW = sW cW : c2

W − s2

W : −sW cW : 0,

Triplet, YT = 0.

(63)

The predicted ratio RZγ (cid:39) (cW /sW )2 (cid:39) 3.3 is in slight tension with the existing LHC
searches for Zγ resonances. The tight correlations among λf are lifted at dimension seven,
see L(7)
T in Eq. (42), thus again necessarily implying violation of the EFT power counting. It
can be easily veriﬁed that the number of independent parameters at that order is suﬃcient

to completely de-correlate S decay rates to various EW gauge boson ﬁnal states.

If S is part of an electroweak triplet this means that that T ± charged states are also
being produced. The production cross sections depend on the couplings of the triplet to the
light quarks, b quarks and to the electroweak bosons. The dominant decays are T ± → 2j
and the decays to gauge bosons, T ± → W ±γ and T ± → W ±Z.

V. VBF PRODUCTION

An interesting possibility to probe diﬀerent couplings of the resonance to the standard

model is given by measuring the production in association with two forward jets, similar to

the Higgs vector boson fusion.7

Given that the new state is probed in the γγ ﬁnal state together with the unavoidable

correlations between the other electroweak ﬁnal states, we learn that there is a minimal

7 Note that the discussion presented here is related but complementary to that in [30]. In that work, it was
shown that a variety of related observables, such as the jet multiplicity and kinematic distributions, may
be used to distinguish the gluon fusion and photon fusion scenarios.

contribution to the VBF cross section. In practice, we may search for VBF by choosing a

set of VBF cuts, such as requiring two jets with:

pT (j) > 60 GeV ,

|ηj| < 5 ,

|∆η(jj)| > 3.6 , mjj > 1 TeV .

(64)

Note that all production channels will generate events that pass the VBF cuts, though we

expect a larger ratio of the rate after the VBF cuts versus the inclusive rate for actual

vector-boson fusion production channels. For simplicity, we restrict this discussion to spin

0, and we comment brieﬂy on spin 2 at the end of the section.

Below, we use MadGraph [29] to simulate the diﬀerent cross sections. For spin zero the

In Fig. 6 we plot RVBF/inc as a function of RZγ for a variety of quark and gluon production
channels. We switch on one production channel at the time, p = gg, u¯u, d ¯d, s¯s, c¯c, b¯b, and
take Rp to be the maximal experimentally allowed value, given in [6]. In addition we allow
for the electroweak production. For ﬁxed RZγ the diphoton rates (65), (66) still depend
on two variables that can be taken as RZZ and κ. These are varied making sure that the

22

8 TeV bound on RW W,ZZ are obeyed, resulting in the colored regions in Fig. 6 (left panel
for branch-1, right panel for branch-2).

The purely electroweak production is shown as a blue band. The VBF to inclusive
ratio, RVBF/inc, is seen to depend heavily on whether RW W and RZZ are from the upper
or the lower branch solution (for a given RZγ, see, for example, Fig. 4). For the other
production channels the width of the bands is smaller; the smaller the width of the bands,

the smaller the relative contribution of the VBF production from electroweak gauge boson

fusion. For instance, for the maximal value of gluon fusion, the VBF production is always
sub-leading. For b¯b production, on the other hand, electroweak gauge boson production can

be comparable.

Interestingly, we ﬁnd that for RZγ (cid:38) 2.5 the observable RVBF/inc can distinguish the pure
electroweak production from all the other production channels. In particular, if RVBF/inc is

found to be greater than 2.6%, then the production must occur through electroweak gauge

boson fusion. If RVBF/inc < 0.3%, then the production must receive contributions from the

quark channels. This is particularly relevant given that in Sec. II we showed that the current

most-favored production channels are heavy-quark annihilation and gluon fusion; the VBF

analysis gives a method for discriminating these scenarios. The ratio RVBF/inc cannot be

greater than 5.3% in any of the channels.

The ability for RVBF/inc to distinguish between channels is not as clear in the spin-2

scenario, for one because in this case the quark contributions to VBF are enhanced relative

to the spin-0 scenario. Explicitly, we ﬁnd that

The enhanced RVBF/inc ratio for quark production for spin 2 compared to spin 0 may be

understood because the coupling of Sµν to quarks scales with the momentum of the quarks,

while the coupling of the spin-0 resonance to quarks is momentum independent. As such, the

Sµν production through quark anti-quark production occurs preferentially with higher quark

momenta and thus a larger fraction of the events pass the VBF cuts, compared to spin-0

production. Thus, for spin 2 the VBF cuts are less eﬃcient at reducing the contribution for

quark anti-quark annihilation.

VI. CONSTRAINTS ON THE PARTIAL WIDTHS OF S

One of the more exciting possibilities is that the low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory of
the SM plus a single new ∼750 GeV particle is insuﬃcient at low energies to explain the
observations and that new light states are also required. For example, there are hints that
the total width ΓX may be quite large, ∼45 GeV. Such a large width may be obtained
within the EFT framework described in this paper, but—as we show below—obtaining this

width puts strong constraints on other observables, such as RVBF/inc, or may require large
branching ratios to t¯t. However, it should be noted that the large width is only supported

by ATLAS data [1] at the moment.

The production rate of the resonance times the branching ratio to photons, σγγ = σ13 TeV
BRγγ, is ﬁxed by the CMS and ATLAS observations, though the best-ft values of σγγ depend

on the production channel (see Tab. I). For spin-0, the inclusive cross section is given in (66).

for the spin-0 resonance S decaying to hadronic ﬁnal states and electroweak gauge boson as a

function of the VBF/inclusive ratio RVBF/inc. To ﬁnd the maximum rate, we marginalize over the
κ parameter and consider both branch 1 (left) and branch 2 (right) for the ratios RW W,ZZ, as a
function of RZγ. We allow S to couple to electroweak gauge bosons and either gg, b¯b, c¯c, s¯s, d ¯d,
or u¯u, as shown.

The total decay rate ΓS may be written as

ΓS = Γγγ (1 + RZγ + RZZ + RW W + Rgg + Ru¯u + Rd ¯d + Rs¯s + Rc¯c + Rb¯b + Rt¯t

+Re¯e + Rµ¯µ + Rτ ¯τ + Rinvisble) .

(70)

Each of the ratios R above is subject to constraints (see, for example, [6]). We consider
the possibility that the non-vanishing rates are those to electroweak gauge bosons and—as
suggested by the current data—either gg, b¯b, c¯c, s¯s, d ¯d, or u¯u. Current limits, scaled from
8 TeV to 13 TeV, then imply Rgg <∼ 1300 and Rb¯b <∼ 500 [6]. As was shown in Sec. V, the
rates to gluons and quarks also determine the ratio R0
VBF/inc. This allows us determine the

width as a function of R0

VBF/inc for these scenarios, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

In Fig. 7, we show—for each channel—the maximum value of (1/σγγ)Γhad+EW, where

Γhad+EW is the rate to quarks (except top), gluons, and electroweak gauge bosons, as a
function of the VBF ratio RVBF/inc.8 We normalize σγγ to 4.2 fb. Note that to ﬁnd the

(right) panel refers to branch 1 (branch 2) for the ratios RZZ,W W . Note that on the far right
of these plots, the production is completely through EW gauge boson fusion. At the other

extreme, at very small values of RVBF/inc, the production is dominated by the heavy quarks

or gluon fusion (depending on the relevant channel). This is true for all channels except

branch 1 of the gluon fusion channel, where both the smallest and largest values of RVBF/inc

are obtained through EW gauge boson fusion. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that that the maximum

Γhad+EW is a strong function of RVBF/inc for each channel. Thus, dual measurements of

Γhad+EW and RVBF/inc may help illuminate the possibility that new light states are required

in the EFT or that large branching ratios to currently-weakly-constrained ﬁnal states, such
as t¯t, are required.

The above discussion is relevant only for the spin-0 resonance; if the resonance is instead

spin 2, then the relationship between RVBF/inc and the partial width to hadronic and elec-

troweak states is not so clear.

In part, this is because—in this case—there is no strong

separation in RVBF/inc between quark anti-quark annihilation and vector boson fusion. On

the other hand, the partial width is in general much smaller in the spin-2 scenario since

the production cross section is enhanced. More speciﬁcally, after marginalizing over all pro-

duction channels, we ﬁnd that the constraint (4.2 fb/σγγ)Γhad+EW < 5 GeV. Thus, if the
width of the resonance is indeed ∼45 GeV and the resonance is spin 2, then additional de-
cays are required. Future data, combined with the formalism presented above, should help

distinguish between these possibilities.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we showed that the eﬀective ﬁeld theory of the new state S, combined with

the standard model, leads to non-trivial signatures at the level of the LHC observables. In

Sec. IV, we concentrated on the decay of S and showed that there are necessarily decays

into other electroweak ﬁnal states, with non-trivial relations between the branching ratios

among the ﬁnal states. Importantly, the branching-ratio relations and sum rules we derived

on more parameters. However, in general the rate to hh (57) is found to be small (< 3 GeV), except for
a narrow range of RZγ ∈ [0.5, 0.75], where—only for branch 1—it is possible for the rate Γhh to be larger
without violating current constraints.

26

in that section will be tested in future runs of the collider. In Sec. V we asked a related

question: given the eﬀective ﬁeld theory and the rate to diphotons observed so far, how can

observables, such as ratios of rates that survive VBF cuts to inclusive rates, tell us about

the coupling of S to non-electroweak states, such as quarks. We showed that the VBF

ratio is a discriminator between gluon-fusion production and, for example, quark anti-quark

production. This is particularly relevant, given that in Sec. II we showed that current LHC

data supports production through either gluon fusion or heavy quark annihilation. Similarly,

in Sec. VI we showed that additional constraints on the coupling of the resonance to non-

electroweak states are found when considering simultaneously the total width along with

the VBF ratio. In summary, we have provided a variety of simple relations directly among

observables at the LHC which, in light of the low energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory, may have

profound implications for understanding the nature of the excess as more data accumulates.
