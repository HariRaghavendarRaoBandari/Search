Résumé

Dans quelle mesure peut-on lire les propriétés dynamiques (quand le temps tend
vers l’inﬁni) d’un système sur des simulations numériques ? Pour tenter de répondre
à cette question, on étudie dans cette thèse un modèle rendant compte de ce qui se
passe lorsqu’on calcule numériquement les orbites d’un système à temps discret f (par
exemple un homéomorphisme). L’ordinateur travaillant à précision numérique ﬁnie, il
va remplacer f par une discrétisation spatiale de f , notée fN (où l’ordre de la discrétisa-
tion N rend compte de la précision numérique). On s’intéresse en particulier au com-
portement dynamique des applications ﬁnies fN pour un système f générique et pour
l’ordre N tendant vers l’inﬁni, où générique sera à prendre dans le sens de Baire (prin-
cipalement parmi des ensembles d’homéomorphismes ou de C1-diﬀéomorphismes).

La première partie de cette thèse est consacrée à l’étude de la dynamique des discré-
tisations fN lorsque f est un homéomorphisme conservatif/dissipatif générique d’une
variété compacte. L’étude montre qu’il est illusoire de vouloir retrouver la dynamique
du système de départ f à partir de celle d’une seule discrétisation fN : la dynamique
de fN dépend fortement de l’ordre N. Pour détecter certaines dynamiques de f il faut
considérer l’ensemble des discrétisations fN, lorsque N parcourt N.

La seconde partie traite du cas linéaire, qui joue un rôle important dans l’étude
du cas des C1-diﬀéomorphismes génériques, abordée dans la troisième partie de cette
thèse. Sous ces hypothèses, on obtient des résultats similaires à ceux établis dans la
première partie, bien que plus faibles et de preuves plus diﬃciles.

Abstract

How is it possible to read the dynamical properties (ie when the time goes to in-
ﬁnity) of a system on numerical simulations? To try to answer this question, we study
in this thesis a model reﬂecting what happens when the orbits of a discrete time sys-
tem f (for example an homeomorphism) are computed numerically . The computer
working in ﬁnite numerical precision, it will replace f by a spacial discretization of f ,
denoted by fN (where the order N of discretization stands for the numerical accuracy).
In particular, we will be interested in the dynamical behaviour of the ﬁnite maps fN for
a generic system f and N going to inﬁnity, where generic will be taken in the sense of
Baire (mainly among sets of homeomorphisms or C1-diﬀeomorphisms).

The ﬁrst part of this manuscript is devoted to the study of the dynamics of the
discretizations fN, when f is a generic conservative/dissipative homeomorphism of a
compact manifold. We show that it would be mistaken to try to recover the dynamics
of f from that of a single discretization fN : its dynamics strongly depends on the order
N. To detect some dynamical features of f , we have to consider all the discretizations
fN when N goes through N.

The second part deals with the linear case, which plays an important role in the
study of C1-generic diﬀeomorphisms, discussed in the third part of this manuscript.
Under these assumptions, we obtain results similar to those established in the ﬁrst part,
though weaker and harder to prove.

This manuscript is an improved version of the thesis [Gui15g] of the author. Some papers

have been extracted from it:

– Chapters 4 and 5 resume largely the content of [Gui15d]. Compared to this article,
some statements have been improved, others have been added, some misprints have
been corrected, additional simulations have been inserted. . .

– Chapter 6 it is almost identical to the article [Gui15e].
– The complete proof of Theorem III can be found in the article [Gui15a], which also

includes a proof of Theorem P concerning the linear case.

– Still concerning the C1 generic case, the article [Gui15g]aims to prove Theorem VI.
– For its part, the content of Chapter is largely resumed in [Gui15f] and in the permanent

preprint [GM14] in collaboration with Y. Meyer.

– A small article [Gui15b] deals with Theorem 8.36.
– Finally, a paper concerning Theorem 7.29 is in preparation, in collaboration with É.

Joly [GJ16].

This text is aimed to evove with the progression of research in the subject.

The author would like to thank again François Béguin, Étienne Ghys, Enrique Pujals,

Introduction

1.1 Presentation of the problem

The goal of this manuscript is to study the dynamics of spatial discretizations of
discrete-time dynamical systems. This problem is motivated by numerical considera-
tions: take a dynamics (X, f ), where X is a “good” space of conﬁgurations (the reader
can think about a bounded domain of Rn or the torus Tn), and f : X → X is a continuous
map, given by an explicit formula. We want to understand the dynamics of f , i.e. the
asymptotical behaviour of the iterates f k of f , by the help of simulations. To do that,
the simplest idea consists in taking a point x ∈ X, and asking the computer to compute
the images f t(x), for a time t “large enough”.

Let us analyse what happens: the computer works with a ﬁnite numerical accuracy,
for example 10 decimal places 1. So it does not make the computations in the phase
space X but rather in a discrete space E10, which is the set of points of X whose co-
ordinates have at most 10 decimal places. The computer also replaces the map f by
a discretization f10 : E10 → E10 of f , which is an approximation of the dynamics f on
the discrete space E10. This ﬁnite space is a quite good approximation of the contin-
uous space X. However, it may happen that the small roundoﬀ errors made at each
iteration of f10 add up, so that after a while the orbits of a point x under the map f
and it discretization f10 become very diﬀerent. Thus, if nothing more is known about
the dynamics f , one can not deduce the asymptotic behaviour of the orbit of x under f
from its orbit under the discretization f10, even if a numerical accuracy of 10 numerical
places can seem quite good.

f t
10(x)

t∈N

Nevertheless, this discrete orbit

is close to a true orbit of f on every
segment of reasonable length. So one can hope that the collective behaviour of the com-
puted orbits – where by collective we mean that we consider a lot of starting points –
reﬂects the global dynamics of f .

Our goal here is to analyse this naive algorithm, which describes what happens
when calculi are performed without any precaution. In other words, we want to un-
derstand the dynamical phenomena appearing when the phase space of a dynamical
system is discretized; we would like to rely the asymptotical behaviour of f (i.e. when
the times goes to inﬁnity) with that of the discrete map f10. Thus, we will not try to ﬁnd
the best algorithm that allows to detect some dynamical features of some dynamics f ;

1. This is not exactly what happens in general, as the most common number format is ﬂoating point.
In this format, the number of digits is ﬁxed (instead of the number of decimal places). In our work, we
will neglect this aspect.

Chapter 1. Introduction

our aim will not be to conduct numerical studies aiming to decide if the real dynamics
of f is observed in practice either.

Note that this problematic is very diﬀerent from that of classical numerical analysis.
Somehow, given a time t0 and a precision δ, numerical analysts determine a method
(in particular a grid) that allows to approach the solution during a time t0 and with a
precision δ. Here, we ﬁx a ﬁne enough grid and compare asymptotical behaviours of
the real system and the discretized system on this grid.

In this manuscript, we will consider discrete-time dynamical systems f : X → X,
where X is a compact manifold (with or without boundary) endowed with a metric d,
and f is a countinuous map from X into itself. The operation of discretization will be
modelled in the following way. Consider a sequence of grids (EN)N∈N which are ﬁnite
subsets of X, whose mesh tends to 0 2. We deﬁne a projection PN : X → EN which maps
every point of X on the closest point 3 of EN. The discretization of a point x ∈ X is then
deﬁned as the point PN(x), and the discretization] of a map f as the map

(cid:16)
fN : EN −→ EN
x (cid:55)−→ PN

f (x)

.

To compute fN(x), we compute f (x) and project it on EN via the projection PN. Remark
that this model of the roundoﬀ error is imperfect: in practice, the computer uses also
ﬁnite numerical precision when doing intermediate calculus to compute f (x); we will
neglect this aspect.

We can now specify a little more the question we are interested in.

Question. What dynamical properties of f can be read on the (global) dynamics of the dis-
cretizations (fN)N∈N?

To try to answer this question, the ﬁrst idea is to study what happens for simple and
well-known dynamics. This is done in É. Ghys in [Ghy94], where the author studies the
discretizations of the cat map, a linear Anosov automorphism of the torus deﬁned by

Figure 1.1 shows the iterates of a numerical picture under A: such a picture is made
of pixels – here 610× 610 –, thus corresponds to a map φ : E610 → (cid:126)1,256(cid:127)3. So one can
consider its pushforwards by the map A610 (recall that AN denotes the discretization of
A on the grid EN). Two very speciﬁc phenomena are observed.

– First, when the picture is iterated, one still obtain pictures. In other words, the
colour of each pixel is well deﬁned. In general, there is no reason for the dis-
cretizations of a homeomorphism 4 to be bijections. Here, the particular form of
A – it is a linear automorphism with integer coeﬃcients – forces the discretiza-
tions AN to be permutations of the grids EN. In fact, for the map A there is no
need to project: every point x ∈ EN is mapped by A to a point of EN.

2. I.e. for every ε > 0 and every N large enough, the grid EN is ε-dense in X.
3. If there are many closest points, we choose one of them once and for all.
4. Or more generally of a continuous map.

size 610× 610. From left to right and top to bottom, times 0, 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, 26, 30 et 60.

– Secondly, the initial map comes back after very few iterations (60 in the example
of Figure 1.1). However, the global order of a typical permutation of a set of N2
elements is equivalent to N2ln N (see for example [Bol01]); Applied to N = 610,
this asymptotic gives an order about 5.1035: if the map A610 were a typical per-
mutation, our poor cat would come back after 1035 iterations (which is manifestly
bigger than 60)! In fact, the following result has been proved by F. Dyson and
H. Falk in [DF92] : for every N ∈ N, the order of the permutation AN is smaller than
3N. Moreover, there exists a sequence of integers (Nk)k∈N, tending exponentially to
inﬁnity, such that the order of the permutation ANk is 2k.

This behaviour of the discretizations contrasts sharply with the actual dynamics of
the linear automorphism A: this map is a paradigm of exponentially mixing systems. If
the dynamics of discretizations reﬂected that of A, the resulting pictures would quickly
become uniformly grey (what is observed in the centre of Figure 1.1, at the 14th itera-
tion) and stay forever (unlike what is observed on the last images of Figure 1.1).

12

Chapter 1. Introduction

It follows from these observations that the example of the linear automorphism A is
very particular: the grids EN somehow resonate with the dynamics A, because the grids
EN are regularly spaced, and because A has special arithmetic properties.

To avoid these “exceptional” phenomena, É. Ghys proposes (still in [Ghy94]) to
study the discretizations of generic conservative homeomorphisms of the torus; this is
what we will do in this manuscript.

The word “generic” has a very precise mathematical sense. Most of reasonable func-
tional spaces are complete (it will always be the case here). In particular, one can apply
Baire theorem: every countable intersection of open dense sets, is itself dense. We say that
a property (P) is generic for the class of functions considered if it is satisﬁed on at least
a countable intersection of open dense sets of such functions. Note that this concept of
genericity has two nice properties:

– a generic property is satisﬁed on a dense set;
– if (P) and (Q) are generic, then the property “satisfying both (P) and (Q)” is itself

generic; this remains true even for a countable family of properties;

Thus, we will study the dynamics of discretizations of generic homeomorphisms
and C1-diﬀeomorphisms, both conservative (i.e. under the assumption of preserving a
good measure on X, ﬁxed a once for all) and dissipative (that is to say without measure
preservation assumption).

By abuse of language, we will often use the expression “generic homeomorphism”,
and list its properties. We should have in mind that such a generic homeomorphism
does not exist: a bit like in quantum mechanics, where a measurement inevitably per-
turbs the system studied; try to choose a generic element of a space, thereby it will cease
to be. This abuse of language is thus very bad, and when meeting it, the reader should
mentally substitute the sentence “if f is a generic element of this space, then it has the
property (P)” with the more correct one “the property (P) is generic in this space”.

Let us precise what is meant by “the dynamics of discretizations”. Every discretiza-
tion fN : EN → EN is a map from a ﬁnite set into itself. In particular, each of its orbits is
pre-periodic, that is, for every point x ∈ EN, the orbit of x under fN is eventually peri-
odic: there exist two integers C and T such that for every k ≥ C, we have f k+T
N(x).
Thus, we can partition EN into two subsets: the recurrent set Ω(fN) of fN, which is the
union of periodic orbits of fN, and its complement called the wandering set of fN. Note
that the recurrent set Ω(fN) is stable under fN, and that the restriction of fN to this set
is a bijection. Moreover, each x ∈ EN “falls” in Ω(fN), i.e. there exists t ∈ N such that
N(x) ∈ Ω(fN); and Ω(fN) is the smallest subset of EN having this property.
f t
Thus, from the combinatorial viewpoint, the dynamics of fN is characterized by a
small number of quantities: the number of periodic orbits of fN and the repartition of
their lengths, the sizes of their basins of attraction 5, the stabilization time of fN (i.e. the
smallest t ∈ N such that f t
N(EN) = Ω(fN)), etc. We will focus in more detail on the degree
of recurrence D(fN) of fN, which is the quotient between the cardinality of the recurrent
set Ω(fN) and the cardinality of the grid EN.

N (x) = f k

This combinatorial dynamical properties of fN does not depend on the geometry of
the grids EN. However, we have supposed that grids are good approximations of the
space X from the metrical viewpoint. In other words, for every ε > 0 and every large
enough N, the grid EN is ε-dense in the space X. The space X can also be endowed
with a good measure λ, in this case we can also suppose that the uniform measures on

the grids EN tend to λ. This hypotheses allow to study geometric or ergodic dynamical
properties of the discretizations. For instance, one can wonder if the periodic orbits of
fN tend to that of f . More generally, one can wonder if the invariant compact subsets of
fN tend (for Hausdorﬀ topology) to the invariant compact subsets of f . The same kind
of questions can be asked for invariant measures endowed with weak-* topology.

Quite surprisingly, this problem has been only little studied. To my knowledge,
apart from works analysing numerically well-chosen examples, or explaining phenom-
ena by heuristic arguments (see Section 2.2), there is very few theoretical works about
this problem

Indeed, only P.P. Flockermann and T. Miernowski have really conducted a systematic
study for a large class of systems 6. In his thesis under the supervision of O.E. lanford,
P.P. Flockermann has considered discretizations of expanding maps of the circle. Dur-
ing his thesis under the supervision of É. Ghys, T. Miernowski has studied the case of
circle homeomorphisms (see also [Mie06]). Basically, he shows that the dynamical prop-
erties of a typical (generic or prevalent) circle homeomorphism/diﬀeomorphism can be
read on the dynamics of discretizations. The proofs of all these results use crucially the
fact that the phase space is one dimensional (in particular, for homeomorphisms, they
depend a lot on the rotation number); thus could not be generalized to other classes of
systems.

During his thesis [Mie05], T. Miernowski has also studied a bit the case of generic
conservative homeomorphisms of the torus. For this purpose, the torus T2 = R2/Z2 is
endowed with Lebesgue measure and canonical discretization grids (deﬁned by Equa-
tion (1.1)); the set of homeomorphisms of the torus that preserve Lebesgue measure is
denoted by Homeo(T2,Leb). T. Miernowski shows the following result.
Theorem I (Miernowski). For a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb),
there exists a subsequence fNk of discretizations of f , whose elements are permutations of ENk.
This theorem is somehow the starting point of this thesis: we would like to show
other results of this kind, to understand better the dynamics of discretizations of a
generic homeomorphism or diﬀeomorphism.

1.2 Some results of this thesis

This manuscript contains many statements, concerning combinatorial, topological
or ergodic properties of discretizations of diﬀerentiable or just continuous systems, con-
servative or dissipative. . . In this section, I isolate those which seem the more represen-
tative and interesting. For a more systematic presentation of the results, see the intro-
ductions of the diﬀerent parts of this manuscript; also, in Chapter 13, we will discuss
and compare the results obtained in these diﬀerent contexts.

In this section, for simplicity, we consider the case where X = T2 = R2/Z2, endowed

if necessary with Lebesgue measure Leb, and with the uniform grids

Chapter 1. Introduction

1.2.1 Degree of recurrence

Let us begin by two theorems concerning the combinatorial dynamics of discretiza-
tions, more precisely the degree of recurrence. Recall that the degree of recurrence
D(fN) is deﬁned as the ratio between the cardinality of the recurrent set of fN (which
is the union of the periodic orbits of fN, see page 12) and that of the grid EN. Since
the positive orbit of any point of EN under the discretization fN falls in this recurrent
set, the degree of recurrence is also equal to Card
/ Card(EN) for every t large
enough.

f t
N(EN)

The ﬁrst result concerns the behaviour of D(fN) for a generic conservative 7 homeo-
morphism: in Chapter 5, we prove the following result (Corollary 5.24 page 77).
Theorem II. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb), the sequence
(D(fN))N≥0 accumulates on the whole segment [0,1].

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

The accumulation on 1 is a trivial corollary of Theorem I of T. Miernowski. Consid-
ered independently, Theorem I can be seen as very positive: it expresses that an inﬁnite
number of discretizations behaves the same way as the homeomorphism, namely is a
measure-preserving bijection. In fact, this phenomenon is only a particular case of a
: Theorem II asserts that it accumu-
very erratic behaviour of the sequence
lates on the biggest set on which it can a priori accumulate.

N≥0

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

We then study the case of generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphisms. We show the

following theorem in Chapter 11 (Theorem 11.26 page 238).
Theorem III. For a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(T2,Leb), we have

lim
N→+∞ D(fN) = 0.

This theorem has to be compared with Theorem II: it expresses that the global be-
haviour of discretizations evolves less irregularly when N grows than in the case of
homeomorphisms. Nevertheless, the fact that the degree of recurrence tends to 0 means
that there is an arbitrarily large loss of information when N is large enough.

To prove the theorem, we link the macroscopic and mesoscopic behaviours of dis-
cretizations of a generic diﬀeomorphism. To begin with, we deﬁne the rate of injectivity
of f

Card(f t

N(EN))

Card(EN)

N(f ) =

By deﬁnition, their limit as t tends to inﬁnity is the degree of recurrence D(fN). There-
fore we are led to study these rates of injectivity; in particular we prove a result that
connects them to similar quantities concerning the diﬀerentials of f (Theorem 11.3
page 223, see also Theorem 11.11 page 227).
Theorem IV. For every r ≥ 1, and for a generic conservative Cr-diﬀeomorphism f ∈
Diﬀr(T2,Leb), for every t ∈ N∗

, we have

N→+∞ τt

N(f ) =

where the rate of injectivity of a sequence of matrices is deﬁned similarly to that of a diﬀeo-
morphism (see Deﬁnition 7.19 page 146).

1.2. Some results of this thesis

This result allows to reduce the study of the degree of recurrence of a generic diﬀeo-
morphism to that of the rate oﬁnjectivity of a generic sequence of matrices; this is the
subject of Part 2 of this manuscript.

1.2.2 Physical measures

(cid:16)
(cid:17)
x, f (x),··· , f T−1(x)

We now turn to the ergodic dynamics of discretizations. To begin with we deﬁne
the concept of physical measure. We set µf
x,T the uniform probability measure on the
. This allows to set the basin of attraction of a prob-
segment of orbit
ability measure µ as the set of points x ∈ T2 such that the measures µf
x,T tend to µ when
T tends to +∞ (in the sense of the weak-* topology). The measure µ is then called phys-
ical for f if its basin of attraction has strictly positive Lebesgue measure. A physical
measure is a measure that should be detected during physical experiments because it is
“seen” by a set of points x with positive Lebesgue measure. The question is whether it
is possible to identify such measures on numerical experiments.

Note that in this spirit, there are many results on the stochastic stability of physical
measures, to take into account the fact that in a physical experiment there is always
noise (see for example [Via97]). In many cases, it turns out that despite the noise, one
can recover the physical measures of the starting dynamics. These studies always as-
sume that the noise is random, and especially independent at each iteration, which is far
from being the case of digital truncation. The question is whether such results persists
for discretizations. As fN are ﬁnite maps, the measures µfN
x,T converge to the uniform
measure on the periodic orbit in which falls the positive orbit of xN under fN. We de-
note µfN
x this measure. The goal is to characterize the behaviour of these measures for
“most” of the points x ∈ EN. In this regard, we prove the following result (Theorem 5.43
page 84).
Theorem V. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb), for every f -
invariant probability measure µ, there exists a subsequence of discretizations (fNk)k such that
fNk has a unique fN-invariant measure µk, tending to µ. In other words, for every f -invariant
probability measure µ, there exists a sequence of integers (Nk)k≥0 such that, for every x ∈ T2,
we have

fNk
x

µ

−→
k→+∞ µ.

Note that the theorem of Oxtoby-Ulam (one of the ﬁrst results of genericity, see
[OU41]) implies that a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb) do
has a unique physical measure: Lebesgue measure. Theorem V expresses that somehow,
any f -invariant measure is “physical for an inﬁnity of discretizations” (it also responds
to the question raised by M. Blank in [Bla97, p. 114], in the case of generic conservative
homeomorphisms). This result can be considered as positive or negative depending
on the point of view: one can ﬁnd all the f -invariant measures, but for now nothing
allows us to detect the physical measures of f on its discretizations. Recall that the very
deﬁnition of physical measures is supposed to detect the measures that are observable
in practice.

This phenomenon even appears on numerical simulations of conservative homeo-
morphisms: Figure 1.2 represents a numerical simulation of measures µfN
T2, where µfN
T2
is the Cesàro limit of the pushforwards by fN of the uniform measure on EN. We can
observe that on this example the measures µfN
T2 do not converge towards Lebesgue mea-

sure at all. In addition, they have nothing to do the ones with the others, even if the
discretization orders are very close.

In Chapter 12 we obtain a similar result for C1-diﬀeomorphisms. Unfortunately,
this result is not strong enough to explain the behaviours of the measures µfN
x for all the
points x ∈ T2; it only express what happens for a generic set of points (Theorem 12.1
page 247).
Theorem VI. For a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorpihsm f ∈ Diﬀ1(T2,Leb), for a generic
point x ∈ T2, for every f -invariant measure µ there exists a subsequence (fNk)k of discretiza-
tions such that

Compared to Theorem V, notice that the sequence (Nk)k now depends on the point
x. Still, if one chooses a conservative diﬀeomorphism f and a point x ∈ T2, and we

1.2. Some results of this thesis
17
compute numerically the uniform measure on the orbit x, f (x),··· , f T(x) for a large T,
then Theorem VI expresses it may be that one does not ﬁnd at all a physical measure of
f , but rather any invariant measure of f . This phenomenon can be observed in practice,
as shown by numerical simulations of the measures µfN

x (see Figure 1.3).

The proof of this result is rather long and technical. It uses crucially a linear state-
ment (shown at the end of Part 2) quite close to the one used to prove Theorem III.
It also uses two classical closing lemmas: the connecting lemma for pseudo-orbits of
C. Bonatti and S. Crovisier [BC04], and an improvement of an ergodic closing lemma of
F. Abdenur, C. Bonatti and S. Crovisier [ABC11].

1.2.3 Detecting rare dynamics (from the measure viewpoint)

In Chapter 6, we study the computation of the rotation set of a generic conservative
torus homeomorphism. We take advantage of a phenomenon illustrated by Theorem V:
the discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism allow to ﬁnd all the in-
variant measures of the homeomorphism, not just its physical ones. Thus we show that,
paradoxically, numerical errors are useful (or even necessary) to compute the rotation
set of a generic conservative homeomorphism.

The rotation set of a torus homeomorphism is a compact and convex subset of
R2 deﬁned modulo Z2 (see its deﬁnition page 6.1.1). This is a generalization to
two dimensions of the concept of rotation number of a circle homeomorphism: this
set describes how fast the orbits wind around the torus. For a generic conservative
homeomorphism/C1-diﬀeomorphism, it has nonempty interior (see Propositions 6.2
and 10.13 pages 109 and 218).

We will deﬁne the observable rotation set: a vector v belongs to the observable rota-
tion set if, for every ε > 0, there exists a positive Lebesgue measure set of points x whose
orbit has a rotation vector ε-close to v (see Deﬁnition 6.9 page 111). This deﬁnition is
meant to represent the rotation set that would be obtained by making exact computa-
tions, but by being allowed to make only a ﬁnite number of such computations. We will
show the following theorem (Theorem 6.23 page 116).
Theorem VII. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb),

– the observable rotation set is reduced to a point;
– the superior limit of the rotation sets of discretizations coincides with the rotation set

of f .

The second assertion of this theorem remains true for a generic conservative C1-
diﬀeomorphism, considering the convex hulls of the rotation sets of discretizations (see
Theorem 10.15 page 218). The ﬁrst assertion remains also true as long as Lebesgue
measure is ergodic for f ; it is conjectured that this is the case for a generic conserva-
tive C1-diﬀeomorphism (and there are open sets of diﬀeomorphisms in which a generic
element is ergodic, see page 246).

This theorem gives an algorithm to approximate the rotation set, consisting in cal-
culating the rotation sets of discretizations. In Figure 1.4, we see that the “natural”
algorithm only detect a very small part of the whole rotation set, unlike the algorithm
using discretizations (as predicted by Theorem VII). In Chapter 6, we will see on other
examples that this algorithm is quite eﬃcient. This is an unexpected application of
the concept of discretization: truncation, which seems a priori to be an annoying phe-
nomenon, can actually be exploited to detect certain dynamics. Paradoxically, to re-
trieve these dynamics, it can be useful to make voluntary coarse roundoﬀ errors.

Chapter 1. Introduction

Figure 1.4: Comparison of methods of computation of the rotation set on the homeo-
morphism f (see its deﬁnition in section 6.4). On the left, the set obtained using the
natural algorithm consisting in calculating rotation vectors of very long orbits. On the
right, the set obtained by accumulating the rotation sets of discretizations on diﬀerent
grids. Calculation times are similar (about 4 hours).

This phenomenon of stabilization of each dynamical invariant of f by an inﬁnite
number of discretizations can be explained as follows. Each dynamical invariant of
f we will study can be approximated by a periodic orbit ω (or a ﬁnite union of such
orbits). Generically, the points of ω are of Liouville type with respect to the sequence
of grids, that is to say, there exists a subsequence of orders N for which each point
of ω is very close to a grid point 8, close enough so that for some orders N, if x ∈ ω,
then fN(xN) = (f (x))N. In this case, there is a discrete orbit close to the actual orbit
ω. For a practical system (which therefore does not necessarily verify the hypotheses
of the theorems, which assume that the systems are generic), it is hoped that a similar
phenomenon occurs: if the orbit ω is not too long, then it is likely that considering a
reasonable number of discretizations on diﬀerent grids, we recover the orbit ω on at
least one of these grids.

1.3 Reading guide

This manuscript is divided into four parts. Part 1 concerns discretizations of generic
homeomorphisms. Part 2 focuses on the discretizations of linear maps. In Part 3, we
study the discretizations of generic C1-diﬀeomorpihsms. Finally, Part 4 analyses and
compares the results obtained in the four ﬁrst parts..

In Part 1, Chapter 3 consists in notations and preliminaries, which will be used
throughout Part 1. The reader will also ﬁnd an index of notations at the end of this
memoir. Chapters 4 and 5 are widely independents, while Chapter 6 uses notions de-
veloped in Chapters 4 and 5.

Part 2 is completely independent from Parts 1 and 3. More precisely, Chapter 7
is somehow an introduction to Chapter 8, where lies most of the original results of

this part. Chapter 9, is very short, and uses the formalism set up in the two previous
chapters.

Part 3 uses the results of Part 2. In more details, Chapter 10 is independent from
the rest of the manuscript, but we will often compare the results with those obtained
in Part 1. Chapter 11 uses crucially the analysis of the linear case made in Part 2.
Finally, in Chapter 12, we combine techniques developped in Part 2 with statements of
Chapter 10.

Finally, Part 4 is a kind of conclusion. In its ﬁrst chapter (Chapter 13), we compare
the obtained results from various viewpoints. In the second one (Chapter 14), I give
examples of open questions that seemed relevant to me.

2.1 Small survey of classical results in generic dynamics

Before looking at the dynamics of discretizations of generic maps, it is good to know
the actual dynamics of these applications (that is to say, without discretization of the
space). In addition, techniques developed for understanding the dynamics of generic
homeomorphisms (or diﬀeomorphisms) will be very useful to study their discretiza-
tions.

One of the very ﬁrsts results in generic dynamics is Oxtoby-Ulam theorem (pub-
lished in 1941, see [OU41]), which states that a generic conservative homeomorphism of
a compact manifold of dimension at least two is ergodic. Since then, many works have
helped to understand the dynamics of a generic conservative homeomorphism. Note
that this dynamics is neither completely trivial nor extremely chaotic: for example, a
generic conservative homeomorphism is topologically mixing, but not strongly mixing
(in the measurable sense). Note also that the techniques used to prove the results are
varied and beautiful: in particular, there is a transfer theorem of ergodic generic prop-
erties from the space of automorphisms to that conservative homeomorphisms (due to
S. Alpern see [Alp79]), or a 0-1 law for generic dynamical ergodic properties (due to
E. Glasner and J. King, see [GK98]). Interested readers can consult the surveys [AP00]
and [Gui12]. Let us give a sketch of the proof of genericity of transitivity (probably one
of the simplest proofs): considering a conservative homeomorphism f ,

– we begin by breaking the dynamics f in discretizing the phase space and applying
Lax’s theorem (see [Lax71] and theorem 5.5 page 70), which asserts that a conser-
vative homeomorphism is arbitrarily close to a cyclic permutation of a grid of the
manifold having some good properties;

– we then rebuild a conservative homeomorphism from this cyclic permutation, by

a C0 closing lemma (Proposition 3.3 page 44).

This proof technique can be used to obtain results on discretizations of generic conser-
vative homeomorphisms; this is what we do in Chapter 5.

The case of generic dissipative homeomorphisms has been studied lately. In fact, the
systematic study lead by E. Akin, M. Hurley and J. Kennedy in the survey [AHK03]
is a bit disappointing, as all the results go in the same direction : the dynamics of
a generic dissipative homeomorphism “contains” simultaneously all the possible wild
behaviours.

21

22

Chapter 2. Historic of the topic

This survey only concerns topological dynamics. Quite recently, F. Abdenur and
M. Andersson studied ergodic properties of generic dissipative homeomorphisms: they
consider the behaviour of Birkhoﬀ sums for almost every starting point (see [AA13]).
For this purpose, they establish a technical result called shredding lemma that allows
them to show that a generic homeomorpihsm is weird (see Deﬁnition 4.1 page 52).
We will make use of this technical lemma to establish dynamics of discretizations of
a generic dissipative homeomorphism.

Properties of generic C1-diﬀeomorphisms is a very active subject – for both conser-
vative and dissipative cases – and so has became very dense. In the conservative case,
the lack of C1 analogue to the property of rebuilding of homeomorphisms forces to es-
tablish closing and connecting lemmas. Among others, the closing lemma of C. Pugh
[Pug67] implies that a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism has a dense set of peri-
odic points. Also, the connecting lemma for pseudo-orbits of C. Bonatti and S. Crovisier
[BC04] implies that a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism is transitive. For its part,
the question of genericity of ergodicity is still open in this context, despite the recent ad-
vance of A. Avila, S. Crovisier and A. Wilkinson [ACW14]: either a generic conservative
C1-diﬀeomorphism has all its Lyapunov exponents null, or is non-uniformly Anosov
and ergodic. There is a lot of other results about this subject, the reader could consult
the survey [Cro06b] of S. Crovisier or the introduction of [ACW14].

For generic dissipative C1 diﬀeomorphisms, the researches are by conjectures of
J. Palis which describe what could be the topological and ergodic dynamics of a generic
element. Again, the subject is very rich and the reader can consult the Bourbaki seminar
[Bon03] or the ICM report [Bon02] of C. Bonatti, the habilitation memoir [Cro13] or the
recent survey [Cro14] of S. Crovisier.

Compared to the situation of C1-diﬀeomorphisms, the study of the dynamical prop-
erties of generic Cr-diﬀeomorphisms, with r > 1, is blocked by the absence of a closing
lemma (about the closing lemma in C1 topology, see the book [Arn98] of M.-C. Arnaud).
To my knowledge, the only case in which we have results other anecdotal (besides the
trivial case of dimension 1) is that of conservative diﬀeomorphisms of surfaces (see the
article [FLC03] of J. Franks and P. Le Calvez). Note that in larger regularity (r ≥ 4),
KAM theorem implies that on any compact surface, there are open sets of conservative
Cr-diﬀeomorphisms (in Cr topology) on which the elements are non transitive (see for
example Section 4 of [Her98]).

2.2 Global survey about spatial discretizations of dynamical

systems

The ﬁrst numerical simulations of dynamical systems appear in the 1960s, with
for example the famous works of E. Lorenz and M. Hénon. Among others, M. Hénon
conducts an extensive digital study of what is now called “conservative Hénon map”
(see [Hén69]):

(cid:16)
x cos α− (y − x2)sin α , x sin α + (y − x2)cos α

fα(x, y) =

(cid:17)

.

M. Hénon notes that the phenomena appearing on simulations (in particular, “elliptical
islands in a chaotic sea”) are consistent with what we already knew about these appli-
cations from a theoretical study. However, he does not actually seem to care about the
possible bad eﬀects produced by the digital truncation.

2.2. Survey about spatial discretizations of dynamical systems

23

A few years later, P. Lax remarks in [Lax71] that the discretization destroys the bi-
jective behaviour of conservative Hénon maps. To overcome this problem, P. Lax shows
that any conservative homeomorphism of the torus is arbitrarily well approximated by
permutations of “natural” grids on the torus. In some sense, even if the discretization
of a homeomorphism is not bijective, we know that there is at least one ﬁnite map close
to this homeomorphism that is. This theorem is to my knowledge the ﬁrst theoretical
result concerning the dynamics of discretizations; its nice proof is essentially combi-
natorial and based on Hall’s marriages lemma (see page 70). An improvement of this
result is proved by S. Alpern in [Alp78] (this result is in fact due to J. Oxtoby and S.
Ulam, see [OU41]): in the statement of Lax theorem (Theorem 5.5 page 70), the term
“permutation” can be replaced by “cyclic permutation”. This result indicates that the
dynamics of any conservative homeomorphism is close to a transitive ﬁnite map. In the
1990s, in [DKP93, KM97], Lax theorem is generalized to the case of applications pre-
serving Lebesgue measure (without assumption of bijectivity or continuity); the authors
also give examples of actual obtaining of the permutation in dimension 1.

From the late 1970s, physicists and mathematicians got interested in discretizations
of particular dynamical systems with well known behaviour. Some articles perform
numerical simulations, and assess the consistency between the results of these sim-
ulations and the actual dynamics of the system. Others study this consistency from
a more theoretical point of view. For example, in 1978, G. Benettin et al. got inter-
ested in obtaining numerically the physical measures of some Anosov diﬀeomorphisms
[BCG+78, BCG+79], including the Arnold cat map and some of its perturbations.

In 1983, in [GT83], J.-M. Gambaudo and C. Tresser show on well chosen examples
that the sinks of a homeomorphism can be undetectable in practice, simply because
the size of their basins can be extremely small, even for homeomorphisms with quite
simple deﬁnition.

Still in the 80s, one sees theoretical work on the dynamics of discretizations of clas-
sical dynamical systems appearing. For example, in [HYG88], the authors are interested
in the shadowing property for some parameters of the Hénon map. They study the same
property for logistic maps in [HYG87] and for the tent and quadratic maps in [NY88].
Finally, in [SB86], they study the characteristics of the orbits of discretizations of the
tent map, namely their number, their lengths and their distribution.

Also, in [Bin92], the author studies numerically the number of limit cycles and the

length of the longest of these cycles for discretizations of some logistic maps.

In [DKPV95, DSKP96, DKKP96, DP96, DKKP97], the authors note that some quan-
tities related to discretizations of dynamical systems of dimension 1 – like the propor-
tion of discretization points in the basin of attraction of the ﬁxed point 0, the distribu-
tion of the length of the cycles, the stabilization time, etc. – are similar to the same
quantities for random applications with an attractive centre, especially when these
quantities are averaged over several successive discretizations. Their study is based
mainly on assumptions of convergence of the dynamics of discretizations to that of the
initial application, veriﬁed experimentally on well-chosen examples.

Finally, in one of its latest papers [Lan98], O.E. Lanford studies simulations of dis-
cretizations of systems of dimension 1. Among others, he focuses on periods and basins
sizes of the periodic orbits of discretizations. He remarks that to retrieve the dynam-
ics of the initial map, the best would be to adjust the time up to which the iterates
of discretizations are computed to the mesh of these discretizations. This viewpoint,
although very interesting, is very diﬀerent from that adopted in this manuscript.

24

Chapter 2. Historic of the topic

These results relate to very speciﬁc examples of dynamical systems; they would not

be easily generalized to wider classes of dynamics.

The idea of O.E. Lanford consisting in adjusting the length of orbit segments had
already been developed in the late 1980s by A. Boyarsky. In [Boy86], he explains heuris-
tically why one usually ﬁnds absolutely continuous measures on simulations. His ar-
guments are based on the tracking of long segments of orbits; the only obstacle for the
obtaining of a rigorous proof is the lack of uniformity in Birkhoﬀ ’s ergodic theorem 1.
In [GB88], A. Boyarsky and P. Góra establish the following result, which also relates

to the obtaining of absolutely continuous measures from discretizations.

Theorem VIII. If f has a unique absolutely continuous invariant measure µ, and if α > 0
is such that there exists a subsequence fN admitting a segment of orbit of length bigger than
αqn (where qn is the cardinality of EN), if one set νN the uniform measure on this segment of
orbit, then νN (cid:42) µ.

The fact of having an absolutely continuous invariant measure is known for rather
large classes of systems (C1+α expanding maps of the circle, C1+α Anosov diﬀeo-
morphsims, . . . ). on the other hand, the existence of a segment of orbit of length pro-
portional to that of the grid seems to be rarely veriﬁed (for example it is not true for
a generic expanding map the circle, simply because the degree of recurrence is zero).
Despite this, apart from Lax theorem, this is one of the ﬁrst theoretical results about
discretizations of dynamical systems.

Meanwhile, research is carried out by Soviet scientists, including M. Blank in
[Bla84, Bla86, Bla89, Bla94], who focuses on the following question (among others):
how to retrieve the periodic orbits of the dynamical system (both attractive and repul-
sive) from the discretizations? The author presents the phenomenon of period doubling:
on discretizations, it may appear an orbit whose length is a nontrivial multiple of that
of the actual orbit it should represent. Note that M. Blank is the author of a monograph
[Bla97] whose ﬁfth chapter is fully devoted to the problem of spatial discretization; in
particular, there is a discussion on the behaviour of invariant measures and a study of
the case of torus rotations.

In the 90s, a group of researchers including P. Diamond, P. Kloeden, V. Kozyakin, J.
Mustard and A. Pokrovskii published a series of articles about detection on discretiza-
tions of some dynamical properties. For example, in 1993, in [DK93], the authors note
that any attractor is detected by the discretizations. The study of discretizations leads
the authors to deﬁne some variants of stable dynamical properties adapted to the study
of discretizations. For example, in [DKP94], they deﬁne a notion of chain transitivity
adapted to ﬁnite maps, the property of “weak chain recurrence”. They then state a lot
of results explaining how to manipulate this concept; in particular they check that it
persists while passing to discretizations. In the same vein, in [DKKP95a, DKKP95b],
the authors deﬁne what they call semi-hyperbolic maps (which include hyperbolic
maps); they establish that semi-hyperbolic maps have the shadowing property and oth-
ers properties such as structural stability of semi-hyperbolicity or semi-continuity of
entropy. Finally, the authors deﬁne what is the minimal centre of attraction, a set con-
taining the non wandering set [DKP96]; by its very deﬁnition, this set is stabilized when
passing to discretizations.

1. In fact, the intuition of A. Boyarsky works for a uniquely ergodic homeomorphism (Proposition IX
of T. Miernowski), but is false in more general situations (Theorem V for generic conservative homeomor-
phisms, and Theorem VI for conservative C1-generic diﬀeomorphisms.

2.2. Survey about spatial discretizations of dynamical systems

This work deserves credit for formally showing that some dynamical properties can
be detected on spatial discretizations. However, one should note that they only con-
cern properties that are by deﬁnition robust (existence of attractive orbits, weak chain
recurrence, etc.), and therefore are naturally inherited by discretizations.

One of the simplest examples of chaotic dynamical systems are torus linear Anosov
automorphisms. In 1992, F. Dyson and H. Falk in [DF92] make a fairly complete theo-

retical study of the global period of discretizations of the Arnold’s cat map
. In
particular, the dynamics of discretizations is completely diﬀerent from that of the lin-
ear Anosov automorphism (see the beginning of this introduction, page 10). This work
was taken up and generalized to all linear Anosov automorphisms of T2 by É. Ghys in
[Ghy94]. In this paper, É. Ghys notes that the global period of discretizations is very
low compared to that of a random map on a set with the same number of elements as
the grid. He attributes this phenomenon to the strong arithmetic properties of linear
automorphisms; this may suggest that it is in some sense exceptional. This leads him to
propose to study the behaviour of discretizations of generic homeomorphisms.

This issue was almost completely solved by T. Miernowski in the case of generic
homeomorphisms of the circle (see [Mie06] and [Mie05]). We will survey these in-
teresting results in Section 2.3. In [Mie06], T. Miernowski also establishes a theorem
about convergence of the dynamics of discretizations to that of the initial map, from
an ergodic point of view, under the rather restrictive assumption that the considered
homeomorphism is uniquely ergodic:
Proposition IX. (Miernowski) Let f : M → M be a homeomorphism having a unique invari-
ant probability measure µ. For every N ∈ N, let γN be a periodic cycle of the N-th discretiza-
tion fN of f . Let νN be the uniform probability measure on the cycle γN. Then the measures
νN converge weakly towards µ, independently from the choice of each cycle γN.

This convergence of the discrete dynamics to the continuous one is again highlighted
in the case of generic conservative torus homeomorphisms by Theorem 2.2.2 of [Mie05]
(that we already met earlier this introduction, see Theorem I): for a generic conservative
homeomorphism, there is a subsequence of discretizations that are permutations of the
grids. The author nevertheless conjecture that this phenomenon is no longer typical in
the case of generic hyperbolic Cr-diﬀeomorphisms of the torus, r ≥ 1. According to him,
the behaviour of the discretizations of such maps should approximate that of a random
map of a set having the same number of elements as the discretization grid.

The question of the behaviour of discretizations of a generic system was also ad-
dressed by P.P. Flockermann in his thesis [Flo02] under the direction of O.E. Lanford.
P.P. Flockermann is interested in Cr expanding maps of the circle for r ≥ 2. He basically
shows that in ﬁnite time, the discretizations of such applications behave the same way
as stochastic perturbations (see Section 2.4). These results, although interesting and
nontrivial, concern only the ﬁnite time behaviour of discretizations and say nothing
about their dynamics.

There are many other points of view about modelling numerical simulations. For ex-
ample, given a family of maps and a dynamical property, one can wonder if a machine
can decide in ﬁnite time if an element of this family has this property. For example,
in [AM04], A. Arbieto and C. Matheus show that the properties “having positive Lya-
punov exponents” and “having an SRB measure” are undecidable among quadratic and

26

Hénon families, and that the property “having positive topological entropy” is decid-
able among the quadratic family.

A study on the modelling of a discretization of a homomorphism by multivalued
maps was made in [LP11] (see also [Mro96] and [DKP96]). This article contains a very
interesting discussion on the transition from continuous to discrete: a priori, one can re-
cover the original system properties from a ﬁnite number of discretizations only when
these properties are robust. This leads the authors to deﬁne a “ﬁnite resolution to prop-
erty”: in particular, these are dynamical properties that can be checked in ﬁnite time
by computational methods.

For diﬀerent viewpoints on the history of discretizations, see the short survey of
J. Buzzi [Buz15], or the more complete survey [GHR12] of S. Galatolo, M. Hoyrup and
C. Rojas.

In a completely diﬀerent context, the discretizations of linear maps have been stud-
ied for applications to image processing. The goal is for example to answer the question:
how to rotate a digital image without losing quality? In particular, we would like to es-
timate the loss of information caused by non bijectivity of discretizations of rotations,
or try to avoid aliasing phenomena (the appearance of resonances between a regular
pattern on the image and the grid made of the pixels). Existing work focuses primarily
on the study of discretisations of linear maps in short time; in particular they exam-
ine the local behaviour of the iterations of Z2 by these discretizations. In addition, the
linear maps studied are always supposed with rational coeﬃcients. We can get an idea
of the topic by consulting the theses [Nou06] and [Thi10] (see also page 134 of this
manuscript for a more complete bibliography).

2.3 Works of T. Miernowski about discretizations of circle

homeomorphisms

In this sub-section, we give the main results concerning the dynamics of uniform
discretizations of circle homeomorphisms, obtained by T. Miernowski in [Mie06]. By
“uniform”, we mean that these discretizations are taken with respect to the grids EN =
{i/N | 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1} (where the circle S1 is identiﬁed with [0,1[).
length, denoted by qN. Then, there exists an integer pN such that if (cid:101)f is a lift of f to
R, and(cid:101)fN is the discretization of(cid:101)f on the uniform grid EN, then for every point(cid:101)x ∈ EN
projecting in a periodic orbit x of fN, we have (cid:101)f qN
N ((cid:101)x) −(cid:101)x = pN. Then, it can be easily

The preservation of a cyclic order on the circle implies that if f is an increas-
ing homeomorphism, then all the periodic orbits of a discretization fN have the same

shown that pN/qN converges to the rotation number ρ(f ) of f .

The simplest example of circle homeomorphism is that of a rotation (there are even
many cases when a homeomorphism is conjugated to an irrational rotation, see for ex-
ample [Her79]). T. Miernowski notes that the discretization of a rotation is itself a rota-
tion; in particular it is bijective. If the number of periodic cycles of the rotation of angle
α is denoted by rN, the following trivial equality holds N = rNqN: the dynamics of fN is
completely determined by the number rN. In the case where α ∈ R \ Q, the behaviour
of rN can be easily deduced from a known result counting rational points in a region of
the plane (see [Wat53], see also [DKKP96]), we get:

Proposition 3.2 of [Mie06] extends this result to the rational case. With these results,

Therefore, in some sense, there is a convergence of the dynamics of discretizations
for Cesàro averages. This is completely opposite to what occurs in the case of generic
conservative homeomorphisms, where even if we try to average over successive orders
of discretizations, combinatorial dynamics of discretizations continues to be highly er-
ratic (see Theorem XXXII page 297).

T. Miernowski then looks at the case of generic circle homeomorphisms. The re-
sults describing the behaviour of the length of periodic orbits of discretizations is the
following.

Proposition XI (Miernowski). An increasing generic circle homeomorphism f has at least
one stable periodic point. In particular, its rotation number is rational, denoted by ρ(f ) = p/q.
Then, there exists N0 ∈ N such that for all N ≥ N0, we have pN = p and qN = q.

This easy result is somewhat disappointing: the dynamical behaviour of discretiza-
tions is the same for all large enough N, and actually stems from the fact that the start-
ing homeomorphism has attractors (it is Morse-Smale). That is why T. Miernowski try
to avoid this type of dynamics: he considers the more diﬃcult case of generic homeo-
morphisms among those with rational rotation number but no attractive orbit, or those
having an irrational rotation number.

In the ﬁrst case, T. Miernowski shows the following theorem.

Theorem XII (Miernowski). Among semi-stables homeomorphisms 2 with rotation number
p/q, there exists an open and dense set for which there exists a subsequence (Nk)k∈N such that
qNk(f ) = q.

The proof of this result uses crucially the natural order on the circle.
In the case of irrational rotation number, T. Miernowski proposes two approaches.

The ﬁrst concerns the generic diﬀeomorphisms.

2. I.e., the lift of f q to R is either always bigger than (or equal to), or always smaller than (or equal to)

the translation of vector p.

lim
N→+∞

= 0.

In other words, the sequence qN(f ) tends to +∞, but has a subsequence which does
arbitrarily slowly. The proof of this result is pretty nice because it is mainly based on
the study conducted in the semi-stable case and the approximation of any irrational
diﬀeomorphism by rational semi-stable ones.

In the second approach, T. Miernowski is interested in the case of prevalent dif-
feomorphisms. The result is very diﬀerent from what happens for generic diﬀeomor-
phisms: the sequence qN(f ) tends to +∞ almost as fast as
Theorem XIV (Miernowski). Let 3 ≤ r ≤ ω, and f be a prevalent irrational Cr-
diﬀeomorphism. Then, for every ε > 0, there exists K > 0 such that qN(f ) ≥ KN1/(2+ε).

The proof of this theorem is mostly based on a classic theorem about prevalent circle
dynamics, i.e. the diﬀerentiable conjugation to rotation theorem due to M. Herman (see
[Her77]).

2.4 Works of P.P. Flockermann and O.E. Lanford about

discretizations of circle expanding maps

In his thesis [Flo02], P.P. Flockermann studies the behaviour of discretizations 3 of
expanding circle map of class (at least) C2. Besides fairly extensive numerical studies,
P.P. Flockermann shows two main results; they express that for a ﬁxed time k, and
under assumptions of linear independence of derivatives, the discretization operation
of a typical circle expanding map behaves essentially as a random perturbation.

First of all, one can make statistics about numerical error done at each iteration: for
x ∈ EN, we denote εk(x, N) = N
the normalized error made at time k
(this error is between −1/2 and 1/2). The theorem of P.P. Flockermann is the following
(Theorem 9 of [Flo02]).

Theorem XV (Flockermann). Let f be a degree 2 expanding map of S1 such that

– either f is generic among Cr expanding maps, r ≥ 2;
– or f is analytic, but diﬀerent from x (cid:55)→ 2x.

Let ϑ : N → R be a map such that 1/N (cid:28) ϑ(N) (cid:28) 1. Then there exists a countable set D ⊂ S1
such that for all x0 ∈ S1 \ D and all k0 ∈ N, the distributions of the k0-tuples

k≤k0
[−1/2,1/2]k0, for x ∈ EN ∩ [x0 − ϑ(N), x0 + ϑ(N)], converge to the uniform distribution on
[−1/2,1/2]k0.

In other words, at an intermediate (or mesoscopic) space scale ϑ(N), around a
generic point x0, the roundoﬀ errors made at each iteration of the discretization are
time-independent and follow the uniform law on [−1/2,1/2]. The proof of this result is
divided into two independent parts. The ﬁrst is a result leading to the conclusions of
the theorem under the hypothesis of linear independence of the successive derivatives.

The second shows that these assumptions are veriﬁed by generic Cr-expanding maps or
analytic expanding maps diﬀerent from x (cid:55)→ 2x.

Using the formalism of model sets, we will give a generalization of this theorem in

arbitrary dimension (Proposition 9.1 page 196).

Secondly, P.P. Flockermann studies the distribution of Card(f

−k
N (x)) for ﬁxed k and a
lot of points x in a small region of S1. For simplicity, we will enunciate the theorem in
the case where time k is 1; the reader will easily infer a general statement (this statement
is still quite tricky to formulate, see Theorem 12 and Corollary 3 of [Flo02]).
Theorem XVI (Flockermann). Let r ≥ 2, and f be a generic Cr-expanding circle map of
degree 2. Let ϑ : N → R be a map such that 1/N (cid:28) ϑ(N) (cid:28) 1. Then there exists a countable
set D ⊂ S1 such that for every x0 ∈ S1 \ D, if we denote {y1, y2} = f
−1(x0), when N goes to
+∞,
– the proportion of points x ∈ EN ∩ [x0 − ϑ(N), x0 + ϑ(N)] which do not have preimage

As the previous one, this theorem states that in short time, the operation of dis-
cretization behaves as a random perturbation: given a dilatation hλ of R of ratio λ, then
the proportion of points in the image of the discretization of hλ is 1/λ. But the graph of
−1(x0), has exactly two branches; the ﬁrst one is well ap-
f , in the neighbourhood of f
(cid:48)(y2). If the family
(cid:48)(y1) and the second by the dilatation hf
proximated by the dilatation hf
(y2)) is Q-free, then the events “have an inverse image under fN in the ﬁrst
(1, f
branch” and “have an inverse image by fN in the second branch” become independent,
which provides the theorem. This implies the following dynamic result.
Theorem XVII (Flockermann, Lanford, unpublished). Let r ≥ 2, and f be a generic Cr-
expanding circle map of degree 2. Then the degree of recurrence of f is 0.

We will prove this result in Section 11.2 (Corollary 11.32). This section also contains
a statement linking the local and global behaviours of discretizations (Theorem 11.16).

Introduction

In this part, we consider the dynamics of discretizations of generic homeomor-

phisms, i.e. we tackle the following question:

Question. Which dynamical properties of a generic homeomorphism f can be read on the
dynamics of its discretizations (fN)N≥0?

We will establish properties for both dissipative, i.e. arbitrary homeomorphisms of
X, and conservative homeomorphisms, i.e. homeomorphisms of X that preserve a given
good probability measure. In this part, our results concern generic homeomorphisms
of a compact manifold (with boundary) of dimension n ≥ 2.

We will prove many results, concerning various aspects of the dynamics of the dis-
cretizations, adapting some classical tools of study of the generic dynamics of home-
omorphisms. Morally, our results express that in the dissipative generic case, the dy-
namics of the discretizations tends to the “physical” dynamics of the initial homeomor-
phism 4 whereas in the conservative generic setting, the dynamics of the discretizations
accumulates on all the possible dynamics of the initial homeomorphism, and moreover
the physical dynamics cannot be detected on discretizations. In the rest of this intro-
duction, we try to organize our results according to some “lessons”:

1) The dynamics of discretizations of a generic dissipative homeomorphism tends to
the “physical dynamics” of the initial homeomorphism.

We ﬁrst study properties of discretizations of generic dissipative homeomorphisms 5.
The ergodic behaviour of such a generic homeomorphism is deduced from the shred-
ding lemma of F. Abdenur and M. Andersson [AA13] (Lemma 4.2), which implies that a
generic homeomorphism has a “attractor dynamics” (see Corollaries 4.5 and 4.8):

Theorem A. For a generic homeomorphism f , the closure A0 of the set of Lyapunov-stable
periodic points is a Cantor set of dimension 0 which attracts almost every point of X. More-
over, the measure µf
X (see Deﬁnition 3.10 page 46) is well deﬁned, atomless and is supported
by A0.

This behaviour easily transmits to discretizations, for example every attractor of the
homeomorphism can be seen on all the ﬁne enough discretizations (Proposition 4.13).

Theorem B. For a generic homeomorphism f , the recurrent set of its discretization Ω(fN)
tends to A0 in the following weak sense: for all ε > 0, there exists N0 ∈ N such that for

all N ≥ N0, there exists a subset(cid:101)EN of EN, stabilized by fN, such that, noting (cid:101)Ω(fN) the
corresponding recurrent set, we have Card((cid:101)EN)

Card(EN) > 1− ε and dH(A0,(cid:101)Ω(fN)) < ε.

Introduction

Moreover, the Cesàro limit of the pushforwards of the uniform measures on the
grid by the discretizations tend to the Cesàro limit of the pushforwards of λ by the
homeomorphism. Indeed, we will prove the following (Theorem 4.16).
Theorem C. For a generic homeomorphism f , the measures 1
m
sure that we denote by µf

i=0 f i∗ λ converge to a mea-

(cid:80)m−1

X (see Deﬁnition 3.10).

Concerning the discretizations, for a generic homeomorphism f , the measures µfN

X tend to
the measure µf
X is the measure on the periodic orbits of fN
such that the global measure of each periodic orbit is proportional to the size of its basin of
attraction (see Deﬁnition 3.10).

X when N goes to inﬁnity, where µfN

Moreover, there is shadowing of the dynamics of f by that of its discretizations fN

(Corollary 4.12).

Theorem D. For a generic homeomorphism f , for all ε > 0 and all δ > 0, there is a full
measure dense open subset O of X such that for all x ∈ O, all δ > 0 and all N large enough,
the orbit of xN under fN δ-shadows 6 the orbit of x under f .

Thus, it is possible to detect on discretizations the “physical” dynamics of a generic
dissipative homeomorphism, that is the dynamics that can be seen by almost every
point of X. This dynamics is mainly characterized by the position of the attractors and
of the corresponding basins of attraction.

2) The dynamics of a single discretization of a generic conservative homeomorphism
cannot be inferred from the dynamics of the initial homeomorphism.

We then turn to the study of the conservative case. The starting point of our study
is a question from É. Ghys (see [Ghy94, Section 6]): for a generic conservative homeo-
morphism of the torus, what is the asymptotical behaviour of the sequence of degrees
of recurrence of fN? A partial answer to this question was obtained by T. Miernowski in
the second chapter of his thesis (see Corollary 5.9).

Theorem E (Miernowski). For a generic conservative homeomorphism 7 f , there are in-
ﬁnitely many integers N such that the discretization fN is a cyclic permutation.

To prove this theorem, T. Miernowski combines a genericity argument with a quite
classical technique in generic dynamics: Lax’s theorem [Lax71] (Theorem 5.5), which
states that any conservative homeomorphism can be approximated by cyclic permuta-
tions of the discretization grids. In fact this proof can be generalized to obtain many
results about discretizations. We will establish some variants of Lax theorem; each
of them, combined with a genericity argument, leads to a result for discretizations of
generic homeomorphisms. For instance, we will prove the following (Corollary 5.36).

Theorem F. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f , there exists inﬁnitely many inte-
gers N such that the cardinality of Ω(fN) is equal to the smallest period of periodic points of
f .

6. That is, for all k ∈ N, d(f k
7. That is, there is a Gδ dense subset of the set of conservative homeomorphisms of the torus on which

N(xN), f k(x)) < δ.

the conclusion of the theorem holds.

37

Note that the combination of these two theorems answer É. Ghys’s question: for a
generic homeomorphism f , the sequence of the degrees of recurrence of fN accumulates
on both 0 and 1; we can even show that it accumulates on the whole segment [0,1]
(Corollary 5.24).

Another variation of Lax’s theorem leads to a theorem that throws light on the be-

haviour of the discretizations on their recurrent set (Corollary 5.22).
Theorem G. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f and for all M ∈ N, there are
inﬁnitely many integers N such that fN is a permutation of EN having at least M periodic
orbits.

To summarize, generically, inﬁnitely many discretizations are cyclic permutations,
but also inﬁnitely many discretizations are highly non-injective or else permutations
with many cycles. In particular, it implies that for all x ∈ X, there exists inﬁnitely many
integers N such that the orbit of xN under fN does not shadow the orbit of x under f :
in this sense, generically, the dynamics of discretizations does not reﬂect that of the
homeomorphism. Note that this behaviour is in the opposite of the dissipative case,
here the individual behaviour of discretizations does not indicate anything about the
actual dynamics of the homeomorphism.

3) A dynamical property of a generic conservative homeomorphism cannot be deduced
from the frequency it appears on discretizations either.

The previous theorems express that the dynamics of a single discretization does not
reﬂect the actual dynamics of the homeomorphism. However, we might reasonably ex-
pect that the properties of the homeomorphism are transmitted to many discretizations.
More precisely, we may hope that given a property (P) about discretizations, if there are
many integers N such that the discretization fN satisﬁes (P), then the homeomorphism
satisﬁes a similar property. It is not so, for instance, we will prove the following result
(Theorem 5.31).

Theorem H. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f , when M goes to inﬁnity, the
proportion of integers N between 1 and M such that fN is a cyclic permutation accumulates
on both 0 and 1.

In fact, for all the properties considered in the previous paragraph, the frequency
with which they appear on discretizations of orders smaller than M accumulates on
both 0 and 1 when M goes to inﬁnity. Remark that these result imply that, even by
looking at the frequency at which some properties occur, the discretizations of a generic
conservative homeomorphism do not behave like typical random maps, as for a random
map of a set with q elements, the average number of periodic orbits is asymptotically
log q (see for example [Bol01, XIV.5]).

4) Many dynamical properties of a generic conservative homeomorphism can be de-
tected by looking at the dynamics of all the discretizations.

We have observed that we cannot detect the dynamics of a generic homeomorphism
when looking at the dynamics of its discretizations, or even at the frequency with which
some dynamics appears on discretizations. Nevertheless, the dynamical properties of
a generic conservative homeomorphism can be deduced from the analogous dynamical
properties of all the discretizations. More precisely, we have a shadowing property of

38

Introduction

the dynamical properties of the homeomorphism: for each dynamical property of the
homeomorphism, its discrete analogue can be seen on an inﬁnite number of discretiza-
tions. It is worthwhile to note the intriguing fact that this shadowing property occurs
for all the dynamical properties of a generic conservative homeomorphism, indepen-
dently of the measure λ, while for a generic dissipative homeomorphism the dynam-
ics of the discretizations converges to the “physical” dynamics of the homeomorphism
(that is, the dynamics depending of λ).

This idea of convergence of the dynamics when looking at arbitrary large precisions
can be related to the work of P. Diamond et al (see page 24). For instance, we will prove
that the periodic orbits of a homeomorphism can be detected by looking at the periodic
orbits of its discretizations (Theorem 5.36).

Theorem I. For a generic homeomorphism f , for every ε > 0 and every periodic orbit of f ,
this periodic orbit is ε-shadowed by an inﬁnite number of periodic orbits of the same period
of the discretizations

We will also prove a theorem in the same vein for invariant measures (respectively
invariant compact sets), which expresses that the set of invariant measures (respectively
compact sets) of the homeomorphism can be deduced from the sets of invariant mea-
sures (respectively invariant sets) of its discretizations. More precisely, we will prove
the following result (Theorems 5.45 and 5.51, see Theorems 5.49 and 5.55 for the com-
pact versions).

Theorem J. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f and for every convex closed set (for
Hausdorﬀ topology) M of f -invariant Borel probability measures there exists an increasing
sequence of integers Nk such that the set of fNk-invariant probability measures tends to M
(for Hausdorﬀ topology).

Moreover, if M is reduced to a single measure, then fNk can be supposed to bear a unique

invariant measure.

In the third chapter of this part, we will present an application of the notion of
discretization to the practical problem of computing numerically the rotation set of
a torus homeomorphism. In particular, we will prove a theorem which expresses the
shadowing property of the rotation set of a generic conservative torus homeomorphism
by the rotation sets of its discretizations (Corollary 6.23).

Theorem K. If f is a generic conservative homeomorphism, then there exists a subsequence
fNi of discretizations such that ρNi (F) tends to ρ(F) for Hausdorﬀ topology (where F is a lift
of f to R2).

This will give us a convenient way to compute the rotation set in practice, as we
will prove that if we compute the rotation set corresponding to a starting point x ∈ T2
without roundoﬀ error, then for almost every x ∈ T2, the obtained rotation set is reduced
to a single vector, that is the mean rotation vector of f (Proposition 6.19).

Theorem L. Let f be a generic conservative homeomorphism of the torus T2 and F a lift of
f to R2. Then for almost every ˜x ∈ R2, the corresponding rotation set

(cid:92)

(cid:91)

(cid:40) Fm( ˜x)− ˜x

(cid:41)

ρ(x) =

m

is reduced to the mean rotation vector with respect to the measure λ.

39

This shows that if we try to compute the rotation set by calculating segments of or-
bits without making any roundoﬀ error, we will only ﬁnd the mean rotation vector of
the homeomorphism. In Chapter 6, we will introduce the notion of observable rotation
set, which expresses which rotation vectors can be found by looking at almost every pe-
riodic orbit. We will compute this set for some examples, in particular for both generic
conservative (that is, Theorem L) and dissipative (Proposition 6.15) homeomorphisms.

5) The “physical dynamics” of a generic conservative homeomorphism plays no partic-
ular role for discretizations.

The heuristic idea underlying the concept of physical measure is that these mea-
sures are the invariant ones which can be detected “experimentally” (since many initial
conditions lead to these measures). Indeed, some experimental results on speciﬁc ex-
amples of dynamical systems show that they are actually the measures that are detected
in practice for these examples (see for example [BCG+78, BCG+79] or [Boy86, GB88]).
Moreover, if the dynamical system is uniquely ergodic, then the invariant measure ap-
pears naturally on discretizations (see [Mie06, Proposition 8.1] and Proposition 5.42).

According to this heuristic and these results, we could expect from physical mea-
sures to be the only invariant measures that can be detected on discretizations of generic
conservative homeomorphisms. This is not the case: for a generic conservative homeo-
morphism, there exists a unique physical measure, namely λ (that follows directly from
the celebrated Oxtoby-Ulam’s theorem [OU41]). According to the previous theorem,
invariant measures of the discretizations accumulate on all the invariant measures of
the homeomorphism and not only on Lebesgue measure.

However, we could still hope to distinguish the physical measure from other invari-
ant measures. For this purpose, we deﬁne the canonical physical measure µfN
X associated
to a discretization fN: it is the limit in the sense of Cesàro of the images of the uniform
measure on EN by the iterates of fN: if λN is the uniform measure on EN, then

(f i

This measure is supported by the recurrent set Ω(fN); it is uniform on every periodic
orbit and the total weight of a periodic orbit is proportional to the size of its basin of
attraction. The following theorem expresses that these measures accumulate on the
whole set of f -invariant measures: physical measures cannot be distinguished from
other invariant measures on discretizations, at least for generic homeomorphisms (see
Theorems 5.51 and 5.53).

Theorem M. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f , the set of limit points of the
X )N∈N is the set of all f -invariant measures. Also, for every f -invariant measure
sequence (µfN
µ, there exists a subsequence fNk of discretizations such that for every x ∈ X, the sequence of
measures 8 µ

tends to µ.

The same phenomenon appears for compact invariant subsets: the the recurrent
subsets of the discretizations fN accumulate on the whole set of invariant compact sub-
sets for f (Proposition 5.55).

x is the Cesàro limit of the pushforwards of the Dirac measure δxN

Introduction

6) On the numerical experiments we performed, the dynamics of a dissipative home-
omorphism can be detected on discretizations, and a lot of diﬀerent dynamical be-
haviours can be observed on discretizations of a conservative homeomorphism.

We will compare our theoretical results with the reality of numerical simulations.
Indeed, it is not clear that the behaviour predicted by our results can be observed on
computable discretizations of a homeomorphism deﬁned by a simple formula. On the
one hand, all our results are valid “for generic homeomorphisms”; nothing indicates that
these results apply to actual examples of homeomorphisms deﬁned by simple formulas.
On the other hand, results such as “there are inﬁnitely many integers N such that the
discretization of order N. . . ” provide no control over the integers N involved; they may
be so large that the associated discretizations are not computable in practice.

We ﬁrst carried out simulations of dissipative homeomorphisms. The results of dis-
cretizations of a small perturbation of identity (in C0 topology) may seem disappointing
at ﬁrst sight: the trapping regions of the initial homeomorphisms cannot be detected,
and there is little diﬀerence with the conservative case. This behaviour is similar to
that highlighted by J.-M. Gambaudo and C. Tresser in [GT83] (see page 2.2). That is
why it seemed to us useful to test a homeomorphism which is C0 close to the identity,
but whose basins are large enough. In this case the simulations point to a behaviour
that is very similar to that described by theoretical results, namely that the dynamics
converges to the dynamics of the initial homeomorphism. In fact, we have actually
observed behaviours as described by theorems only for examples of homeomorphisms
with a very small number of attractors.

For conservative homeomorphisms, our numerical simulations produce mixed re-
sults. From a quantitative viewpoint, the behaviour predicted by our theoretical result
cannot be observed on our numerical simulations. For example, we do not observe any
discretization whose degree of recurrence is equal to 1 (i.e. which is a permutation).
This is nothing but surprising: the events pointed out by the theorems are a priori very
rare. For instance, there is a very little proportion of bijective maps among maps from
a given ﬁnite set into itself. From a more qualitative viewpoint, the behaviour of the
simulations is quite in accordance with the predictions of the theoretical results. For
example, for a given conservative homeomorphism, the degree of recurrence of a dis-
cretization depends a lot on the size of the grid used for the discretization. Similarly,
the canonical invariant measure associated with a discretization of a homeomorphism
f does depend a lot on the size of the grid used for the discretization.

7) Discretizations can actually be very useful and eﬃcient to compute some dynamical
invariants like the rotation set of a torus homeomorphism.

We have also performed numerical simulations of rotation sets. To obtain numeri-
cally an approximation of the observable rotation set, we have calculated rotation vec-
tors of long segments of orbits for a lot of starting points, these points being chosen
randomly fore some simulations and being all the points of a grid on the torus for other
simulations. For the numerical approximation of the asymptotic discretized rotation
set we chosed a ﬁne enough grid on the torus and have calculated the rotation vectors
of periodic orbits of the discretization of the homeomorphism on this grid.

We made these simulations on an example where the rotation set is known to be
the square [0,1]2. It makes us sure of the shape of the rotation set we should obtain
numerically, however it limits a bit the “genericity” of the examples we can produce.

41

In the dissipative case we made attractive the periodic points which realize the ver-
tex of the rotation set [0,1]2. It is obvious that these rotation vectors, which are realized
by attractive periodic points with basin of attraction of reasonable size, will be detected
by the simulations of both observable and asymptotic discretized rotation sets; that is
we observe in practice: we can recover quickly the rotation set in both cases.

In the conservative setting we observe the surprising behaviour predicted by the
theory: when we compute the rotation vectors of long segments of orbits we obtain
mainly rotation vectors which are quite close to the mean rotation vector, in particular
we do not recover the initial rotation set. More precisely, when we perform simulations
with less than one hour of calculation we only obtain rotation vectors close to the mean
rotation vector, and when we let three hours to the computer we only recover one vertex
of the rotation set [0,1]2. On the other hand, the rotation set is detected very quickly
by the convex hulls of discretized rotation sets (less than one second of calculation).
Moreover, when we calculate the union of the discretized rotation sets over several grids
to obtain a simulation of the asymptotic discretized rotation set, we obtain a set which
is quite close to [0,1]2 for Hausdorﬀ distance. As for theoretical results, this suggests
the following lesson:
When we compute segments of orbits with very good precision it is very diﬃcult to recover
the rotation set. However, when we decrease the number of digits used in computations we
can obtain quickly a very good approximation of the rotation set. In fact, we have to adapt
the precision of the calculation to the number of orbits we can obtain numerically.

This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that each grid of the torus is stabi-
lized by the corresponding discretization of the homeomorphism. Thus, there exists
an inﬁnite number of grids such that every periodic point of the homeomorphism is
shadowed by some periodic orbits of the discretizations on these grids.

Grids, discretizations, measures

3.1 The manifold X and the measure λ

The results stated in the introduction for the torus Tn and the Lebesgue measure Leb
actually extend to any smooth connected manifold X with dimension n ≥ 2, compact
and possibly with boundary, endowed with a Riemannian metric d. We ﬁx once and for
all such a manifold X endowed with the metric d. In the general case, Lebesgue measure
on Tn can be replaced by a good measure λ on X:
Deﬁnition 3.1. A Borel probability measure λ on X is called a good measure, or an
Oxtoby-Ulam measure, if it is non-atomic, it has total support (it is positive on every
non-empty open sets) and it is zero on the boundary of X.

These restrictions are supported by Oxtoby-Ulam theorem (Theorem 3.14). We ﬁx

once and for all a good measure λ on X.
Notation 3.2. We denote by Homeo(X) the set of homeomorphisms of X, endowed by
the metric d deﬁned by:

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

d(f , g) = sup
x∈X

d

f (x), g(x)

.

We denote by Homeo(X, λ) the subset of Homeo(X) made of the homeomorphisms that
−1(A)) = λ(A)), endowed with the
preserve the measure λ (i.e. for every Borel set A, λ(f
same metric d. Elements of Homeo(X) will be called dissipative homeomorphisms, and
elements of Homeo(X, λ) conservative homeomorphisms.

3.2 Generic properties

All the functional spaces we will use are Baire spaces, i.e. the intersection of every
countable collection of dense open sets is dense. In particular, the topological spaces
Homeo(X) and Homeo(X, λ) are Baire spaces. Indeed, we easily check that the map

δ(f , g) = d(f , g) + d(f

−1, g

−1)

deﬁnes a distance on Homeo(X) and Homeo(X, λ) which deﬁnes the same topology as
d, and is complete in Homeo(X) and Homeo(X, λ) (see for example [Gui12, Appendice
A.1]).

We will sometimes abusively use the phrase “for a generic element of E , we have the
property (P)”. By that we will mean that “the property (P) is generic in E ”, i.e. “there
exists Gδ dense subset G of E , such that every f ∈ G satisfy the property (P)”.

3.3 C0 extension of ﬁnite maps

The basic tool we will use to perturb a homeomorphism in the C0 topology is the
ﬁnite map extension proposition. It asserts that if we have given a (conservative) home-
omorphism and a pseudo-orbit of this homeomorphism, we can perturb this homeo-
morphism such that this pseudo-orbit becomes a real orbit.
Proposition 3.3 (Finite map extension). Let E ⊂ X\∂X be a ﬁnite set and σ : E → X\∂X be
an injective map. Then there exists an homeomorphism g ∈ Homeo(X, λ) such that g|E = σ.
Moreover, if d(σ,IdE) < δ, then the homeomorphism g can be chosen such that d(g,IdX) < δ.

The last condition ensures that if the ﬁnite map σ is close to a given homeomorphism
g – in other words σ is a good approximation of g –, then the extension of this ﬁnite map
can be chosen close to the map g.

The idea of the proof is quite simple: it suﬃces to compose correctly homeomor-
phisms whose support’s size is smaller than ε and which are central symmetries within
this support. We denote E = {x1,··· , xq} and σ(xi) = yi. For each i, we construct a se-
quence (zj)1≤j≤k such that z1 = xi, yi = zk and d(zj, zj+1) < ε/10. Composing k − 1 home-
omorphisms as above, such that each one sends zj on zj+1, we obtain a conservative
homeomorphism which sends xi on yi. Implementing these remarks is then essentially
technical and boring. A detailed proof can be found in [OU41] or in [Gui12, Section
2.2]. This proposition is valid in the neighbourhood of the identity; to have a result
concerning the neighbourhood of any homeomorphism f it suﬃces to compose by the
inverse of f . The following corollary also includes the case where the map σ is not
injective (as a non injective map is arbitrarily close to an injective one).
Corollary 3.4. Let E ⊂ X\∂X be a ﬁnite set, σ : E → X\∂X, f ∈ Homeo(X) (respectively f ∈
Homeo(X, λ)) and δ > 0. If d(f , σ) < ε, then there exists an homeomorphism g ∈ Homeo(X)
(respectively Homeo(X, λ)) such that d(g|E, σ) < δ and d(f , g) < ε. Moreover, if σ is injective,
we can suppose that g|E = σ.

3.4 Discretization grids, discretizations of a homeomorphism

We now deﬁne a more general notion of discretization grid than in the introduction.
Depending on the case, some additional assumptions about these grids will be needed
(see also the next section).

Deﬁnition 3.5 (Discretization grids). A sequence of discretization grids on X is a sequence
(EN)N∈N of discrete subsets of X\∂X, called grids, such that the mesh of these grids tends
to 0: for all ε > 0, there exists N0 ∈ N such that for all N ≥ N0, the grid EN is ε-dense 1.
We denote by qN the cardinality of EN.

We ﬁx once and for all a sequence (EN)N∈N of discretization grids on X.
To each grid is associated a discretization map in the following way.

Deﬁnition 3.6 (Discretizations). Let PN be a projection of X on EN (the projection of
x0 ∈ X on EN is some y0 ∈ EN minimizing the distance d(x0, y) when y runs through EN).
N consisting of the points x ∈ X for
(cid:48)
Such a projection is uniquely deﬁned out of the set E
which there exists at least two points minimizing the distance between x and EN. On
N the map PN is chosen arbitrarily (nevertheless measurably). For x ∈ X we denote by
(cid:48)
E
1. That is, for every point x ∈ X there exists a point y ∈ EN such that d(x, y) < ε.

3.5. Probability measures on X
45
xN the discretization of order N of x, deﬁned by xN = PN(x). For f ∈ Homeo(X) we denote
by fN : EN → EN the discretization of order N of f , deﬁned by fN = PN ◦ f . We denote by
DN be the set of homeomorphisms f such that f (EN)∩ E
N = ∅.
(cid:48)
If σ : EN → EN and f ∈ Homeo(X), we denote by dN(f , σ) the distance between f|EN

and σ, considered as maps from EN into X.

Remark 3.7. We might wonder why the points of the discretization grids are supposed
to be inside X. The reason is simple: a homeomorphism f sends ∂X on ∂X. Putting
points of some grids on the edge could perturb the dynamics of discretizations fN. In
particular, it would introduce at least one orbit with length smaller than Card(EN∩∂X).
(cid:48)
suppose that the union(cid:83)

and have empty interior for every N large enough. Subsequently, we will implicitly

N∈N E
N is an Fσ with empty interior. It is not a limiting as-
sumption as we will focus only on the behaviour of the discretizations for N going to
N∈N DN, which is the set
of homeomorphisms whose N-th discretization is uniquely deﬁned for all N ∈ N.

3.5 Probability measures on X

In the sequel, we will study some ergodic properties of discretizations of f . Denote
by P the set of Borel probability measures on X endowed with the weak-star topology:
a sequence (νm)m∈N of P tends to ν ∈ P (denoted by νm (cid:42) ν) if for every continuous
function ϕ : X → R,

It is well known that under these conditions, the space P is metrizable and compact,
therefore separable (Prohorov, Banach-Alaoglu-Bourbaki theorem); we equip this space
with a distance dist which is compatible with this topology.
Let f ∈ Homeo(X). For x ∈ T2, we denote by pω(x) the set of limit points of the

sequence

It is a compact subset of the set M f of f -invariant Borel probability measures.

We will pay a particular attention to physical measures

Deﬁnition 3.9. A Borel probability measure µ is called physical (sometimes called SRB,
see [You02]) for the map f if its basin of attraction has positive λ-measure, where the
basin of attraction of µ for f is the set

of points whose Birkhoﬀ’s limit coincides with µ.

Heuristically, the basin of a measure is the set of points that can see the measure,

and physical measures are the ones that can be seen in practice.

To study ergodic properties of homeomorphisms and their discretizations, we deﬁne

natural invariant probability measures associated with these maps:

46

Chapter 3. Grids, discretizations, measures

Deﬁnition 3.10. For any non-empty open subset U of X, we denote by λU the nor-
λ(U) λ|U. We also denote by λN,U the uniform
malized restriction of λ on U, i.e. λU = 1
probability measure on EN ∩ U.
For x ∈ X we denote by µf
x, f (x),··· , f m−1(x):

x,m the uniform measure on the segment of orbit

x the Birkhoﬀ limit of x by:
When the limit exists, we denote by µf

and in this case the Birkhoﬀ limit always exists: it is a measure supported by the pe-

number of points of EN ∩ U whose orbit under fN eventually belongs to this periodic
orbit:

µfN
U = lim

We have deﬁned two types of invariant measures: one from a point x, the other from
the uniform measure λ. The link between them is done by the following remark which
easily follows from the dominated convergence theorem.
Remark 3.11. When U is an open set almost every point (for λU) in which admits a

3.6 Hypothesis on discretization grids

Previously, we have given a very general deﬁnition of the concept of sequence of
discretization grids. In some cases, we will need additional technical assumptions about
these sequences of grids; of course all of them will be satisﬁed by good sequences of
uniform discretization grids on the torus (as deﬁned in the introduction).

The ﬁrst assumption is useful for proving Lax’s theorem (Theorem 5.5), and there-

fore necessary only in the part concerning conservative homeomorphisms.

Deﬁnition 3.12 (Well distributed and well ordered grids). We say that a sequence of
discretization grids (EN)N∈N is well distributed if we can associate to each x ∈ EN a subset
CN,x of X, which will be called a cube of order N, such that:

– for all N, {CN,x}x∈EN is a measurable partition of X: (cid:83)
– for all N and all x ∈ EN, x ∈ CN,x;
x∈EN CN,x has full measure
and for two distinct points x, y of EN, the intersection CN,x∩ CN,y is null measure;
– for a ﬁxed N, the cubes {CN,x}x∈EN have all the same measure;
– the diameter of the cubes of order N tends to 0: maxx∈EN diam(CN,x) −→
If (EN)N∈N is well distributed and if {CN,x}N∈N,x∈EN is a family of cubes as above, we
will say that (EN)N∈N is well ordered if, for a ﬁxed N, the cubes {CN,x}x∈EN can be indexed
by Z/qNZ (recall that qN = Card(EN)) such that two consecutive cubes (in Z/qNZ) are
close to each other:

N→+∞ 0.

max
i∈Z/qNZ

diam(Ci
N

∪ Ci+1

N ) −→

N→+∞ 0

(in particular, it is true when the boundaries of two consecutive cubes overlap).

At ﬁrst glance, it can seem surprising that there is no link between the cubes and
the projections. In fact, the existence of such cubes expresses that the grids “ﬁt” the
measure λ.

The following deﬁnition describe assumptions on grids that will be useful for ob-

taining properties on average.

Deﬁnition 3.13 (self similar grids). We say that a sequence of discretization grids
(EN)N∈N is sometimes self similar if for all ε > 0 and all N0 ∈ N, there exists two inte-

3.7 Some examples of discretization grids

In the previous section we set properties about discretizations – being well dis-
tributed, being well ordered, being sometimes/always (strongly) self similar – for a
later use. In this section, we study these properties for some natural examples of grids.

Uniform discretization grids on the torus
The simplest example of grid of discretization, which will be used for the simula-
tions, is that of the torus Tn = Rn/Zn of dimension n ≥ 1 endowed with discretizations
called uniform discretizations, deﬁned from the fundamental domain In = [0,1]n of Tn:
take an increasing sequence of integers (kN)N∈N and set (see Figure 3.1, left)

We easily verify that this sequence of grids is well distributed, well ordered and
always self similar. If we assume that for for every N0 ∈ N, there exists N2 ≥ N1 ≥ N0
such that kN1 divides kN2, then the sequence is sometimes strongly self similar. If we
further assume that for any N ∈ N, kN divides kN+1 (which is true when kN = pN with
p ≥ 2), then the sequence is always strongly self similar. When kN = pN with p = 2
(respectively, p = 10) the discretization performs what we can expect from a numerical
simulation: doing a binary (respectively, decimal) discretization at order N is the same
as truncating each binary (respectively decimal) coordinate of the point x ∈ In to the
N-th digit, i.e. working with a ﬁxed digital precision 2.

2. In practice, the computer works in ﬂoating point format, so that the number of decimal places is not

the same when the number is close to 0 or not.

Uniform discretization grids on the cube

In the case of the cube In = [0,1]n, there are two natural types of grids of discretiza-
tion. In the ﬁrst one the grids are obtained by taking the same deﬁnition as the grids
EN (but avoiding taking points on the boundary of the cube):

with an increasing sequence (kN)N∈N of integers. To these grids are associated the
cubes 3 (see Figure 3.1, middle)

N2 ≥ N1 ≥ N0 such that kN1

self similar. If we further assume that for any N ∈ N, kN − 1 divides kN+1 − 1 (that is, for
every N, there exists an integer (cid:96)N > 1 such that kN+1 = kN + (cid:96)NkN(kN + 1)), and either
kN always divides kN+1 or kN never divides kN+1, then the sequence is always strongly
self similar.

We can also take discretizations according to the centres of the cubes:

This time, the cubes are much more natural (see Figure 3.1, right):

Again, we easily verify that this sequence of grids is well distributed, well ordered and
always self similar. Moreover, it is sometimes strongly self similar if for every N0 ∈ N,
there exists N2 ≥ N1 ≥ N0 such that kN2/kN1 is an odd integer, and always strongly self
similar if kN+1/kN is an odd integer for all N ∈ N.
3. Be careful, these cubes have their vertices on the grid of order kN − 1.

Chapter 3. Grids, discretizations, measures

Discretization grids on an arbitrary manifold

In fact, discretizations on arbitrary manifolds can be easily obtained from discretiza-
tion grids on the cube In (for example the grids E0
N) by applying the Oxtoby-Ulam the-
orem (see [OU41] or [Gui12, Corollaire 1.4]). This theorem asserts that every smooth
connected compact manifold of dimension n, possibly with boundary, equipped with a
good measure λ, is obtained from the unit cube In by gluing together some parts of the
boundary of the cube. Moreover, this gluing map can be chosen such that the image of
Lebesgue measure on the cube is λ.

Theorem 3.14 (Oxtoby, Ulam). Under the assumptions that have been made on X and λ,
there exists a map φ : In → X such that:
1. φ is surjective;
2. φ| ˚In is a homeomorphism on its image;
3. φ(∂In) is a closed subset of X with empty interior and disjoint from φ( ˚In);
4. λ(φ(∂In)) = 0;
5. φ

(λ) = Leb, where Leb is Lebesgue measure.

∗

This theorem allows to deﬁne discretization grids on X from discretizations on the

cube; this is outlined by the following informal proposition.

Proposition 3.15. If there is a sequence (EN)N of grids on In whose elements are not on the
edge of the cube, then its image by φ deﬁnes a sequence of grids on X which satisfy the same
properties as the initial grid on the cube.

Remark 3.16. The example also includes the case where X = In, λ = Leb and where
the grids are the images of the grids EN by a unique homeomorphism of X preserving
Lebesgue measure.

Chapter 4

Discretizations of a generic dissipative

homeomorphism

In this chapter, we study the dynamical behaviour of the discretizations of generic
dissipative homeomorphisms, i.e. without the assumption of preservation of a given
measure.

The dynamics of a generic dissipative homeomorphism is very stable: the shredding
lemma of F. Abdenur and M. Andersson (Lemma 4.2) implies that for a generic homeo-
morphism, there exists a Cantor set of dimension 0 which attracts almost every point of
X (see Corollary 4.5). From that we will deduce easily the dynamics of the discretiza-
tions of a generic homeomorphism from that of the homeomorphism itself.

This study of the dynamics of a generic homeomorphism suggests that in the generic
dissipative setting, “the physical dynamics of the discretizations of a homeomorphism
f converges to the physical dynamics of f ”, both from topological and measurable view-
points. Indeed, we will prove that for a generic homeomorphism and for almost every
point x ∈ X, the orbit of xN by the discretization fN shadows the orbit of x by f (Corol-
lary 4.12). Moreover, we will prove that the recurrent set Ω(fN) tends to the closure
of the set of Lyapunov stable periodic points of f in a weak sense deﬁned in Propo-
sition 4.13; from a combinatorial viewpoint, the cardinality of this recurrent set is as
small as possible (Corollary 4.14) and the length of the longest periodic orbit tends to
+∞ when N goes to +∞ (Corollary 4.15). Finally, we will prove that the measures µfN
X
tend to the measure µf
X, which is the Cesàro limit of the sequence of pushforwards of λ
by f (Theorem 4.16).

The end of this chapter will be dedicated to the results of the numerical simulations.
Throughout this chapter, we ﬁx a compact manifold X of dimension n ≥ 2. Here, home-
omorphisms are not supposed to be conservative; more formally, we recall that we denote by
Homeo(X) the set of all dissipative homeomorphisms of X (without assumption of conserva-
tion of a given measure). The manifold X is equipped with a sequence (EN)N∈N of discretiza-
tion grids and a good measure λ as deﬁned in Section 3.1 (we will use this measure to look
at the physical dynamics, that is the dynamics of almost every point), we suppose that the
N→+∞ λ. We are interested in properties
of discretizations of generic elements of Homeo(X) with respect to the sequence of grids (EN).

Chapter 4. Discretizations of a generic dissipative homeomorphism

4.1 Dynamics of a generic dissipative homeomorphism

In their article [AA13], F. Abdenur and M. Andersson try to identify the generic
ergodic properties of continuous maps and homeomorphisms of compact manifolds.
More precisely, they study the behaviour of Birkhoﬀ limits 1 µf
x for a generic homeo-
morphism f ∈ Homeo(X) and almost every point x for λ. To do this, they deﬁne some
interesting behaviours of homeomorphisms related to Birkhoﬀ limits, including one
they call weird.
Deﬁnition 4.1. A homeomorphism f is said weird if almost every point x ∈ X (for λ)
has a Birkhoﬀ’s limit µf
x , and if f is totally singular (i.e. there exists a Borel set with total
measure whose image by f is null measure) and does not admit any physical measure.

This deﬁnition is supported by their proof, based on the shredding lemma, that
a generic homeomorphism is weird. We state an improvement of this lemma, whose
main consequence is that a generic homeomorphism has many open attractive sets, all
of small measure, and decomposable into a small number of small diameter open sets:
Lemma 4.2 (Shredding lemma, F. Abdenur, M. Andersson, [AA13]). For every homeo-
morphism f ∈ Homeo(X), for all ε, δ > 0, there exists integers (cid:96) and (cid:96)1,··· , (cid:96)(cid:96), bigger than
1/ε, and a family of regular pairwise disjoints open sets 2 U1,··· , U(cid:96) such that for all ε
> 0,
there exists g ∈ Homeo(X) such that d(f , g) < δ and:
(i) g(Uj) ⊂ Uj,
(cid:17)
(ii) λ(Uj) < ε,
(iii) λ
j=1 Uj
(iv) λ(g(Uj)) < ε
(v) for all j ≤ (cid:96), there exists open sets Wj,1,··· , Wj,(cid:96)j such that:

e) We can further assume that each set Wj,i contains a Lyapunov stable periodic point

Moreover, these properties remain true on a neighbourhood of the homeomorphism g.

We outline the proof of this lemma: by using arguments such as the Oxtoby-Ulam
theorem (Theorem 3.14) or the concept of uniform grid on the cube In, it is possible to
shorten a little the arguments of [AA13].

Figure 4.1: Local perturbation for Lemma 4.2

Proof of Lemma 4.2. Let f ∈ Homeo(X) and δ, ε > 0. To begin with, we endow X with
a collection of “cubes”: for N large enough, the images of the cubes associated to the
the grid E1
N on the cube In (see page 49) by the map given by Oxtoby-Ulam theorem
(Theorem 3.14) give us a collection of cubes (Ci) such that their union has full measure,
their boundaries have null measure, they all have the same measure and their diameters
are smaller than δ. To each cube Ci we associate its centre ei. These properties assert
that this collection of cubes behaves like the collection of cubes on In endowed with
Lebesgue measure. Thus, in the sequel, we will only treat the case of In endowed with
Leb.
We deﬁne a ﬁnite map σ : {ei}i → {ei}i such that f (ei) ∈ Cσ(ei). Making a perturbation
if necessary, we can suppose that σ does not contain any periodic orbit of length smaller
than 1/ε (simply because if N is large enough, then for all ei there exists at least 1/ε other
points ej such that d(ei, ej) < δ). We then use Corollary 3.4 to move the points f (ei) closer
to the points ej, in other words we build a homeomorphism g1 which is δ-close to f and
such that maxi
We then set g2 = g1 ◦ h, where h is a homeomorphism close to the identity whose
restriction to every cube is a huge contraction (see Figure 4.1): such a contraction can be
easily expressed on the cube [−1,1]n: let α be a “big” number (determined by min(ε, ε

))

We then build easily h by composing such contractions on each cube, each of them being
obtained by conjugating by a translation and a homothety.
The “physical” dynamics of the map g2 is then close to that of the ﬁnite map σ
which maps ei on the unique centre ej such that g(ei) ∈ Cj. In particular, the periodic
sets Wj,1,··· , Wj,(cid:96)j are obtained as neighbourhoods of a given periodic orbit of σ, and the
corresponding basins of attraction Uj are unions of subsets of the cubes 4 whose centres
have some iterates by σ which fall in this periodic orbit. We then easily check that these
sets satisfy the conclusions of the lemma, apart from the point (ii).

Thus, we have to prove that the basins of attraction can be supposed to have small
measure. To do that, we consider the cubes of order M = kN with k > 1/ε, and partition
this set of cubes into kn sets of cubes in the way deﬁned by the fact that these grids are
strongly self similar (see page 49). We then use this self similarity to perturb f such that
σ stabilizes each one of these subgrids, and apply the same technique as previously.

4. More precisely, for every cube Cj, the sets Uj contain {x ∈ C | d(x, ∂Cj) > (1− ε)diam(C)}.

Chapter 4. Discretizations of a generic dissipative homeomorphism
Deﬁnition 4.3. For a homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X), we denote by A0 the set of Lya-
punov stable periodic points of f , i.e. the set of periodic points x such that for all δ > 0,
there exists η > 0 such that if d(x, y) < η, then d(f m(x), f m(y)) < δ for all m ∈ N.

an integer i > 0 such that f i(K) ⊂⊂ K.

The following lemma ensures that for a generic homeomorphism, every set Wj,i of
the shredding lemma contains at least one (in fact an inﬁnite number of) Lyapunov
stable periodic point.
Lemma 4.4. For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X), for every strictly periodic topo-
logical ball O (i.e. there exists i > 0 such that f i(O) ⊂⊂ O), there exists a Lyapunov stable
periodic point x ∈ O.
Proof of Lemma 4.4. We begin by choosing a countable basis of closed sets of X: for
example we can take KN the set of unions of the closures of the cubes of order N. We
also denote by B the set of all closed topological balls of X. We deﬁne Uk,ε,N as the
set of homeomorphisms such that each large enough strictly periodic ball contains a
smaller strictly periodic ball with the same period 5:

such that f i(K) ⊂⊂ K and to make the obtained periodic point attractive.
Uk,ε,N satisﬁes the conclusions of the lemma.
First of all, remark that for every topological ball K with non-empty interior which
is strictly i-periodic, there exits N ∈ N and a smaller topological ball ˜K ⊂ K which is
(cid:84)
strictly i periodic such that ˜K ∈ KN. It implies that if f belongs to the Gδ dense set

and at least twice smaller. Taking the intersection of such balls, we obtain a periodic
point with period i which is Lyapunov stable by construction.

The shredding lemma tells us a lot about the dynamics of a generic homeomor-
phism, which becomes quite clear: there are many attractors whose basins of attraction
are small and attract almost all the manifold X. Moreover there is convergence of the
attractive sets of the shredding lemma to the closure of the set of Lyapunov stable peri-
odic points of f .
Corollary 4.5. Let f ∈ Homeo(X) verifying the conclusions of the shredding lemma for all

converge for Hausdorﬀ distance when ε tends to 0 to a closed set which coincides generically
with the set A0 (see Deﬁnition 4.3).
Moreover, generically, the set A0 is a Cantor set (that is, it is compact, without any iso-
lated point and totally disconnected) whose Hausdorﬀ dimension 6 is 0.
Remark 4.6. Thus, for a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X), the ω-limit set of al-
most every point x ∈ X is included in A0.
Proof of Corollary 4.5. Let f verifying the hypothesis of the corollary. We want to show
that the sets Aε tend to A0 for Hausdorﬀ distance when ε goes to 0. This is equivalent
to show that for all δ > 0, there exists ε0 > 0 such that for all ε < ε0, A0 ⊂ B(Aε, δ) and
Aε ⊂ B(A0, δ) (where B(A, δ) denotes the set of points of X whose distance to A is smaller
than δ). Subsequently we will denote by Uj,ε and by Wj,i,ε the open sets given by the
(cid:48)
shredding lemma for the parameters ε = ε
Let δ > 0. We start by taking x ∈ X whose orbit is periodic with period p and Lya-
punov stable. Then there exists η > 0 such that if d(x, y) < η, then d(f m(x), f m(y)) < δ/2
for all m ∈ N; we note O = B(x, η). As λ(O) > 0 there exists ε0 > 0 such that for all
ε ∈]0, ε0[, there exists j ∈ N such that the intersection between O and Uj,ε is non-empty.
of (f pm(y))m∈N which tends to a point x0; moreover f m(y) ∈ (cid:83)
Let y be an element of this intersection. By compactness, there exists a subsequence
(cid:16)(cid:83)
i Wj,i eventually and
d(f pm(x), f pm(y)) < δ/2, thus at the limit m → +∞, d(x, x0) < δ/2. We deduce that
x ∈ B
for all ε0 small enough. Since A0 is compact, it is covered by a
ﬁnite number of balls of radius δ/2 centred at some points xi whose orbits attract non-
(cid:48)
empty open sets. Taking ε
0 the minimum of all the ε0 associated to the xi, the inclusion
A0 ⊂ B(Aε, δ) occurs for all ε < ε
(cid:48)
0.
Conversely, let δ > 0, ε < δ and focus on the set Wj,i,ε. By Lemma 4.4, we can suppose
that there exists x ∈ Wj,i,ε whose orbit is periodic and Lyapunov stable. Thus x ∈ A0 and
since the diameter of Wj,i,ε is smaller than δ, Wj,i,ε ⊂ B(A0, δ).

j,i Wj,i,ε0, δ/2

(cid:17)

.

We now prove that the set A0 has no isolated point. Let x ∈ A0 and δ > 0, we want
to ﬁnd another point y ∈ A0 such that d(x, y) < δ. If x ∈ A0 \ A0 then it is trivial that x
is an accumulation point of A0; thus we suppose that x ∈ A0. As x is a Lyapunov-stable
periodic point, there exists a neighbourhood O of x whose diameter is smaller than δ
and which is periodic (i.e. there exists t > 0 such that f t(0) ⊂ O). For ε small enough, the
open set O meets at least two sets Uj,ε and Uj
,ε of the shredding lemma. Thus, applying
the shredding lemma, we deduce that O contains at least two diﬀerent strictly periodic
,ε; by Lemma 4.4 they both contain a Lyapunov-stable periodic point,
sets Wj,i,ε and Wj
and by construction their distance to x is smaller than δ.
Finally we prove that generically, the set A0 has 0 Hausdorﬀ dimension. Let s > 0.
We consider the set of homeomorphisms verifying the conclusions of the shredding
(cid:48)s < 1. This equality implies that for all ε > 0, the s-
lemma for ε

6. And better, if we are given a countable family (λm)m∈N of good measures, generically the Hausdorﬀ

dimension of this set with respect to these measures is zero.

Chapter 4. Discretizations of a generic dissipative homeomorphism

Remark 4.7. We can also prove that for every τ > 0, the set of periodic points with period
τ of a generic homeomorphism is either empty, either a Cantor set with zero Hausdorﬀ
dimension.

From the shredding lemma, we can easily deduce that the sequence of pushforwards
of the uniform measure on an open set U is Cauchy. Thus, it converges to a measure µf
U,
which is supported by A0 and is atomless (because the µf

We now establish a discrete counterpart of the shredding lemma. Since having
basins of attraction is stable by perturbation, we have a similar statement for discretiza-
tions of a generic homeomorphism. In what follows these arguments are developed.

Remark 4.10. Properties (i) to (v) are discrete counterparts of properties (i) to (v) of the
continuous shredding lemma, but the properties (vi) and (vii) reﬂect the convergence
of the dynamics of discretizations to that of the original homeomorphism.

This lemma implies that we can theoretically deduce the behaviour of a generic
homeomorphism from the dynamics of its discretizations. The next section details this
remark.

To begin with, we deduce from the shredding lemma that the dynamics of discretiza-
tions fN tends to that of the homeomorphism f . More precisely almost all orbits of the
homeomorphism are δ-shadowed by the orbits of the corresponding discretizations.
Deﬁnition 4.11. Let f and g be two maps from a metric space X into itself, x, y ∈ X
and δ > 0. We say that the orbit of x by f δ-shadows the orbit of y by g if for all m ∈ N,
d(f m(x), gm(y)) < δ.
Corollary 4.12. For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X), for all ε > 0 and all δ > 0,
there exists an open set A such that λ(A) > 1− ε and N0 ∈ N, such that for all N ≥ N0 and all
x ∈ A, the orbit of xN = PN(x) by fN δ-shadows the orbit of x by f .
Therefore, for a generic homeomorphism f , there exists a full measure dense open set O
such that for all x ∈ O, all δ > 0 and all N large enough, the orbit of xN by fN δ-shadows that
of x by f .
particular O =(cid:83)

Proof of Corollary 4.12. This easily follows from the discrete shredding lemma, and es-
j,i tend to the sets Wj,i for Hausdorﬀ metric, in
pecially from the fact that the sets WN

j,ε Uj,ε.

This statement is a bit diﬀerent from the genericity of shadowing (see [PP99]): here
the starting point is not a pseudo-orbit but a point x ∈ X; Corollary 4.12 expresses that
we can “see” the dynamics of f on that of fN, with arbitrarily high precision, provided
that N is large enough. Among other things, this allows us to observe the basins of
attraction of the neighbourhoods of the Lyapunov stable periodic points of f on dis-
cretizations. Better yet, to each family of attractors (Wj,i)i of the basin Uj of the home-
omorphism corresponds a unique family of sets (WN
j,i)i that are permuted cyclically by
fN and attract a neighbourhood of Uj. Thus, attractors are shadowed by cyclic orbits

Chapter 4. Discretizations of a generic dissipative homeomorphism

of fN and we can detect the “period” of the attractor (i.e. the integer (cid:96)j) on discretiza-
tions: when N = N0, the sets WN
j,i each contain only one point; a phenomenon of period
multiplication might appear for N bigger [Bla89, Bla86, Bla84, Bla94, AHK03]. This
behaviour is the opposite of what happens in the conservative case, where discretized
orbits and true orbits are very diﬀerent for most points.

Again, in order to show that the dynamics of discretizations converges to that of the
initial homeomorphism, we establish the convergence of attractive sets of fN to that of
f . Recall that A0 is the closure of the set of Lyapunov stable periodic points of f (see
Deﬁnition 4.3).
Proposition 4.13. For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X), the recurrent sets Ω(fN)
all N ≥ N0, there exists a subset(cid:101)EN of EN, stabilized by fN, such that, noting (cid:101)Ω(fN) the

proportion greater than 1 − ε of EN. We also denote by (cid:101)Ω(fN) the associated recurrent

set:

To conclude, it suﬃces to apply Corollary 4.5 which asserts that Aε → A0 for Hausdorﬀ
distance.

We now set a ﬁnal consequence of Lemma 4.9, which reﬂects that the ratio between
the cardinality of the image of discretizations and which of the grid is smaller and
smaller:
Corollary 4.14. Let ϑ : R+ → R∗
homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X),

+ be a function that tends to +∞ at +∞. Then for a generic

N→+∞ ϑ(N)

= 0;

more precisely, for every M ∈ N, there existsN0 ≥ M such that for every N ≥ N0, we have

Card(fN(EN))

Card(EN)

≤ 1

ϑ(N0)

.

In particular, the degree of recurrence satisﬁes limN→+∞ D(fN) = 0.

Remark that as Ω(fN) ⊂ fN(EN), the same estimation holds for the recurrent set. This
corollary can be seen as a discrete analogue of the fact that a generic homeomorphism
is totally singular, i.e. that there exists a Borel set of full measure whose image under f
is zero measure. Again, it reﬂects the regularity of the behaviour of the discretizations
of a dissipative homeomorphism: generically, the behaviour of all (suﬃciently ﬁne)
discretizations is the same as the physical behaviour of the initial homeomorphism.

4.2. Dynamics of discretizations of a generic homeomorphism

This is very diﬀerent from the conservative case, where sometimes fN(EN) = EN and
sometimes Card(fN(EN)) ≤ ϑ(N) where ϑ : R+ → R∗
+ is a given map that tends to +∞ at
+∞.

The discrete shredding lemma also allows us to have an estimation about the com-
binatorial behaviour of fNΩ(fN): fN has a lot of periodic orbits, and along these periodic
orbits a lot have long lengths.

Card(EN) > 1− ε (as in Proposition 4.13), such that all the periodic orbits of
fN|(cid:101)EN

have length bigger than M, and such that the number of such orbits is bigger than M.

It remains to study the behaviour of measures µfN

U (see Deﬁnition 3.10). To do that,
we have to suppose that the sequence of grids well behaves with respect to the measure
λ. Again, the results are very diﬀerent from the conservative case: for any open set U,
the measures µfN
Theorem 4.16. For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X) and an open subset U of X,
the measure µf
U is well deﬁned 7 and is supported by the set A0. Moreover the measures µfN
U
tend weakly to µf
U.

U tend to a single measure, say µf
U.

Sketch of proof of Theorem 4.16. The proof of this theorem is based on the shredding
lemma: the set of homeomorphisms which satisfy the conclusions of the lemma is a
Gδ dense, so it suﬃces to prove that such homeomorphisms f satisfy the conclusion of
the proposition. Let U be an open subset of X and ϕ : X → R be a continuous function.
U is well deﬁned, i.e. that

We want to show that on the one hand the integral

For the ﬁrst step, the idea of the proof is that most of the points (for λ) eventually

continuity, the function ϕ is almost constant on the sets f m(Wj,i). Thus the measure

Chapter 4. Discretizations of a generic dissipative homeomorphism

4.3 Numerical simulations

We now present some numerical simulations of dissipative homeomorphisms.
Again, our aim is to compare the theoretical results with the reality of numerical sim-
ulations: for simple homeomorphisms and reasonable orders of discretization, do we
have convergence of the dynamics of the discretizations to that of the homeomorphism,
as suggested by the above theorems?

We simulate homeomorphisms of the form

f (x, y) = (R◦ Q◦ P)(x, y),

where P and Q are two homeomorphisms of the torus that modify only one coordinate:

P(x, y) =

x, y + p(x)

x + q(y), y

,

so that the homeomorphism Q ◦ P preserves Lebesgue measure. We discretize these
examples according to the uniform grids on the torus

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

and Q(x, y) =

(cid:16)
(cid:19) ∈ Tn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ∀j, 0 ≤ ij ≤ N − 1

.

We have tested two homeomorphisms:

with α = 0.00137 and β = 0.00159. This dissipative homeomorphism is a small
C0 perturbation of the identity, whose derivative has many oscillations whose
amplitudes are close to 1. That creates many ﬁxed points which are attractors,
sources or saddles.

– It has also seemed to us useful to simulate a homeomorphism close to the iden-
tity in C0 topology, but with a small number of attractors. Indeed, as explained
heuristically by J.-M. Gambaudo and C. Tresser in [GT83], a homeomorphism like
f1 can have a large number of attractors whose basins of attraction are small. It
turns out that the dissipative behaviour of f1 cannot be detected for reasonable
orders discretization. We therefore deﬁned another homeomorphism close to the

identity in C0 topology, but with much less attractors, say f2 = R2 ◦ Q ◦ P, with P
and Q identical to those used for f1, and R2 deﬁned by

with α = 0.00137 and β = 0.00159.

Remark that we have chosen to deﬁne the homeomorphisms we compute with lacu-

nary trigonometric series, to “mimic” the action of Baire theorem.

4.3.1 Algorithm used for the calculus of invariant measures

The algorithm we used to conduct simulations is quite fast (in fact, it is linear in the
number of points of the grid). It detects all the periodic orbits of the discretizations fN
in the following way. It takes a ﬁrst point x1 ∈ EN and iterates it until the orbit meets
a point that has ever been visited by the orbit. The points belonging to the orbit of
x1 are labelled as falling into the periodic orbit number 1. The algorithm also notes
the number of points that have been attracted by this orbit, and the coordinates of the
points of the periodic orbit. It then takes another point x2 ∈ EN which does not belong to
the orbit of x1. There are two cases: either an iterate of x2 is equal to an iterate of x1, and
in this case it updates the number of points which fall into the periodic orbit number 1;
or an iterate of x2 meets another iterate of x2, and in this case it creates a periodic orbit
number 2, which attracts all the orbit of x2. This procedure is iterated until there is no
more points of EN that have not been visited. Remark that this algorithm computes the
image of a point at most twice.

This algorithm allows to compute quantities like the cardinality of the recurrent set
Ω(fN), the number of periodic orbits of fN, the maximal size of a periodic orbit of fN,
etc. It also allows to represent the invariant measure µfN
X of fN. Recall that this measure
is deﬁned as the limit in the Cesàro sense of the push forward of the uniform measures
on EN by the discretizations fN. It is supported by the union Ω(fN) of the periodic orbits
of fN; the measure of each of these periodic orbits is proportional to the size of its basin
of attraction.
We present images of sizes 128 × 128 pixels representing in logarithmic scale the
density of the measures µfN
X : each pixel is coloured according to the measure carried by
the set of points of EN it covers. Blue corresponds to a pixel with very small measure
and red to a pixel with very high measure. Scales on the right of each image corre-
sponds to the measure of one pixel on the log10 scale: if green corresponds to −3, then
a green pixel will have measure 10
X . For information, when Lebesgue measure
is represented, all the pixels have a value about −4.2.

−3 for µfN

We also compute the distance between the measure µfN

X and Lebesgue measure. The

distance we have chosen is given by the formula

This distance spans the weak-* topology, which makes compact the set of probability

summing only on the k ∈ (cid:126)0,7(cid:127).

62

Chapter 4. Discretizations of a generic dissipative homeomorphism

From a practical point of view, we have restricted ourselves to grids of sizes smaller
than 215 × 215: the initial data become quickly very large, and the algorithm creates
temporary variables that are of size of the order of ﬁve times the size of the initial data.
For example, for a grid 215 × 215, the algorithm needs between 25 and 30 Go of RAM,
and takes about two days of calculus for a single order of discretization.

4.3.2 Combinatorial behaviour

We simulated some quantities related to the combinatorial behaviour of discretiza-

tions of homeomorphisms, namely:

– the cardinality of the recurrent set Ω(fN),
– the number of periodic orbits of fN,
– the maximal size of a periodic orbit of fN.

We calculated these quantities for discretizations of orders 128k for k from 1 to 150,
and represented it graphically (see Figure 4.2). For information, if N = 128× 150, then
qN (cid:39) 3.6.108.

Theoretically, the degree of recurrence, that is, the ratio between the cardinality of
Ω(fN) and qN, should tend to 0 (see Corollary 4.14); this is what we observe on simula-
tions. This is not really surprising: we will even see it for discretizations of conservative
homeomorphisms (see Figure 5.7). In this context, it is interesting to compare the be-
haviour of Ω(fN) in the conservative and the dissipative case. The result is a little dis-
appointing: the graphic for f1, the dissipative homeomorphism, is very similar to that
of f3, the corresponding conservative homeomorphism, while in theory they should be
very diﬀerent. This is quite diﬀerent for f2, where the cardinality of Ω((f2)N) is more
or less linear in N. We have no explanation to the linear shape of this function; if the
maps fN were typical random maps, their degree of recurrence would be linear in N,
with a value would close to 2.4.104 for N = 150×128 (here the value is about three times
bigger).

The theoretical results assert that the number of periodic orbits of fN should tend
to +∞ (as a generic dissipative homeomorphism has an inﬁnite number of attractors).
We can hope that this quantity reﬂects the fact that the dynamics converges to that
of the initial homeomorphism: among others, we can test if it is of the same order as
the number of attractors of the homeomorphism. In practice, this number of periodic
orbits of fN ﬁrst increases rather quickly, to stabilize to around a value of 1.5.104 for
f1 and 9.103 for f2. We could be tempted to interpret this phenomenon by the fact
that after a while, the discretization has detected all the attractors of f and thus, the
number of periodic of the discretizations reﬂects the number of attractors of f . This
idea may be reasonable for f2 (as we will see in observing the invariant measures of
(f2)N in Figure 4.5), but if we compare these graphs in the dissipative case with that of
the conservative case (Figure 5.7), we see that they are as alike as two peas in a pod.
Thus, this is not clear at all that this behaviour is due to the dissipative character of the
homeomorphism or not.

Since the dynamics of discretizations is assumed to converge to that of the initial
homeomorphism, we could expect that the length of the longest periodic orbit of dis-
cretizations (fi)N is almost always a multiple of that of an attractive periodic orbit of
fi. The graphic of this length for f1 looks like the conservative case (see Figure 5.7),
so we can say that the dissipative behaviour of this homeomorphism is not detected in
practical by this quantity. For f2, the length of the longest orbit is much smaller than

f1 (left) and f2 (right), on the grids EN with N = 128k, k = 1,··· ,150.

for f1 (up to a factor 10), and seem to increase linearly in N. This may be imputed to
the fact that f2 is “almost conservative” around its attractive periodic points; thus it has
a conservative behaviour, but at a smaller scale than f1.

4.3.3 Behaviour of invariant measures

We have computed the invariant measures µ

of dissipative homeomorphisms f1
and f2 as deﬁned on page 60. Our aim is to test whether Theorem 4.16 applies in prac-
tice or if there are technical constraints such that this behaviour cannot be observed on
these examples. For a presentation of the representations of the measures, see page 61.

T2 depending on N

Lebesgue measure. Theorem 4.16 says that for a generic dissipative homeomorphism,
this quantity converges to the distance between µf
T2 and Lebesgue measure. Clearly,
this is not what happens in practice for f1: the distance between both measures globally
increases when N increases. Locally, the behaviour of the map N (cid:55)→ dist(µfN
T2,Leb) is
quite erratic: there is no sign of convergence to any measure. When we compare this
with the conservative case (Figure 5.8), we see that both behaviours are very similar. In
other words, we do not see the dissipative nature of f1 on simulations. The behaviour
of the distance between the measure µ
and Lebesgue measure is much more inter-
esting. First of all, we observe that this distance is smaller than for f1. Moreover, it is
globally slightly decreasing in N, and it seem to converge to a value close to 0.2. So it
suggests that the measures µ
converge to a given measure whose distance to Leb is
close to 0.2, as predicted by the theory. In the view of these graphics, we can say that
the behaviour of f2 is much more close to that of a generic dissipative homeomorphism
that that of f1. This can be interpreted in the view of the article of J.-M. Gambaudo and
C. Tresser [GT83]: for f1, the attractors are much too small to be observed in practice
for reasonable orders of discretization.

The behaviour of invariant measures for f1 (see Figure 4.4), which is a small C0 dis-
sipative perturbation of identity, is relatively similar to that of invariant measures for f3
i.e. the corresponding conservative case (see Figure 5.9): when the order discretization
is large enough, there is a strong variation of the measure µ
. Moreover, this measure
has a signiﬁcant absolutely continuous component with respect to Lebesgue measure.
This is very diﬀerent from what is expected from the theoretical results (in particular
Theorem 4.16), which say that for a generic dissipative homeomorphism, the measures
µfN
T2 must converge to the measure µf
T2. Thus, we can say that it is impossible to detect
the dissipative character of f1 on these simulations. Again, as noted by J.-M. Gambaudo
and C. Tresser in [GT83], the size of the attractors of f1 can be very small compared to
the numbers involved in the deﬁnition of f1. So even in orders discretization such as 215,
the dissipative nature of the homeomorphism is undetectable on discretizations. This
is why the discretizations of f1 are very similar to those of its conservative counterpart
f3.

Recall that what happens for the dissipative homeomorphism f1 is rather close to
what happens for the conservative homeomorphism f3. For their part, simulations of

invariant measures for f2 on grids of size 2k×2k (see Figure 4.5) highlight that we expect
from a generic dissipative homeomorphism: the measures µ
seem to tend to a single
measure (that is also observed on a series of simulations), which is carried by the attrac-
tors of f2. The fact that f2 has few attractors allows the discretizations of reasonable
orders (typically 211) to ﬁnd the actual attractors of the initial homeomorphism, con-
trary to what we observed for f1. We also present a zoom of the density of the measures

of a generic dissipative homeomorphism is a Cantor set. On these zoomed simulations,

Discretizations of a generic
conservative homeomorphism

We now study the conservative case, i.e. we study the dynamical behaviour of dis-
cretizations of homeomorphisms of X which are generic among those which preserve
a given good measure λ. In the previous chapter, we proved that the dynamics of the
discretizations of a generic dissipative homeomorphism f converges to the dynamics of
f . This was due to the fact that such a generic homeomorphism possesses attractors
whose basins cover almost all the phase space X. Now, the hypothesis of preservation
of a measure λ precludes this kind of behaviours, as conservative maps do not have
attractors and thus are chain transitive.

We will begin by introducing the concept of dense type of discrete approximation (Def-
inition 5.1), which expresses that a given set of ﬁnite maps on the grids can approach
any conservative homeomorphism. Then, using the proposition of ﬁnite maps exten-
sion (Proposition 3.3), we prove that any dense type of approximation occurs inﬁnitely
many times in the discretizations of a generic homeomorphism (Theorem 5.2). Those
dense types of approximations will be obtained by using Lax’s theorem (Theorem 5.5).
This strategy of proof will lead us to many results concerning the dynamical proper-
ties of discretizations of generic conservative homeomorphisms.
In particular, for a
generic conservative homeomorphism f , under the assumptions that the grids are well
distributed and well ordered:

– there are inﬁnitely many discretizations fN such that fN is a cyclic permutation

(Corollary 5.9);

– for every ε > 0, there are inﬁnitely many discretizations fN such that fN is ε-

topologically weakly mixing (Corollary 5.13, see Deﬁnition 5.11);

– for every period p of a periodic orbit of f , there are inﬁnitely many discretizations
fN such that fN has a unique injective orbit whose corresponding periodic orbit
has length p (Corollary 5.36);

Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism
+ which tends to +∞ at +∞, there are inﬁnitely many
– for every map ϑ : N → R∗
discretizations fN such that Card(fN(EN)) ≤ ϑ(N) (Corollary 5.20);
– if we further assume that the grids are self similar, for every map ϑ : N → R such
that ϑ(N) = o(qN), there are inﬁnitely many discretizations fN such that fN has at
least ϑ(N) cycles which are pairwise conjugated (Corollary 5.22).

Moreover, we prove that we can not hope to observe the actual dynamics of a generic
homeomorphism by looking at the frequency with which some properties appear on
discretizations. For example, if the sequence of grids is strongly self similar, we will
prove that for a generic conservative homeomorphism, for every ε > 0, there are in-
ﬁnitely many M ∈ N such that the proportion of discretizations fN, with 1 ≤ N ≤ M,
such that fN is a cyclic permutation, is greater than 1− ε (Theorem 5.31). We also prove
that under the assumption that the sequence of grids is self similar, the same property
holds when we replace “fN is a cyclic permutation” by “Card(Ω(fN)) = o(qN)” (Corollary
5.27), “fN is ε-topologically weakly mixing” (Corollary 5.28), “ Card(fN(EN))
Card(EN) < ε” (Corol-
lary 5.29) or “fN has at least M periodic orbits” (Corollary 5.30).

However, we will prove that it is possible to recover the dynamics of the initial
homeomorphism by looking at the dynamics of all its discretizations. For example, it is
possible to detect the periodic orbits of f and their periods (Theorem 5.36), to recover
the set of invariant measures of f (Theorem 5.45), or to recover the set of compact
subsets of X that are invariant under f (Theorem 5.49).

From this point of view of the shadowing property of the dynamics of the homeo-
morphism by that of all its discretizations, the “physical dynamics”, that is the dynam-
ical properties that depend on the good measure λ, plays non important role among
all the dynamical properties of f . For instance, we will prove that if the sequence of
grids is self similar, then for a generic homeomorphism f , the sequence of fN-physical 1
X )N∈N accumulates on the the whole set of f -invariant measures (Theorem
measures (µfN
5.51). And with the same techniques of proof we will show a similar result for invariant
compact sets (Proposition 5.55).

The end of this chapter is dedicated to the results of the numerical simulations.

Recall that we have ﬁxed once and for all a manifold X, a good measure λ on X and a
sequence of discretization grids (EN)N∈N (see Deﬁnition 3.5). We further assume that this
sequence of grids is well distributed and well ordered (see Chapter 3). In this chapter, we
will focus on discretizations of elements of Homeo(X, λ), so homeomorphisms will always be
supposed conservative.

5.1 Dense types of approximation

To begin with, we deﬁne the notion of type of approximation.

Deﬁnition 5.1. A type of approximation T = (TN)N∈N is a sequence of subsets of the set
F (EN, EN) of applications from EN into itself.
Let U be an open subset of Homeo(X, λ) (therefore U is a set of homeomorphisms).
A type of approximation T is said to be dense in U if for all f ∈ U , all ε > 0 and all
N0 ∈ N, there exists N ≥ N0 and σN ∈ TN such that dN(f , σN) < ε (recall that dN is the
distance between f|EN and σN considered as maps from EN into X).

X is the limit in the sense of Cesàro of the pushforwards of the uniform measure on EN
by the iterates of fN

5.1. Dense types of approximation

69

The goal of this paragraph is to obtain the following result: every dense type of
approximation appears on inﬁnitely many discretizations of a generic homeomorphism.
This will lead us to a systematic study of dense types of approximation.

Theorem 5.2. Let T be a type of approximation which is dense in Homeo(X, λ). Then for a
generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and for all N0 ∈ N, there exists N ≥ N0 such that
fN ∈ TN.

Thus, we have decomposed the obtaining of generic properties of discretizations

into two steps.

1. The ﬁrst step consists in proving that a given type of approximation is dense. This
part will be done in Section 5.3, the systematic use of Lax’s theorem (see Section 5.2)
will reduce the proof of density of types of approximation to combinatorial problems.

2. The second step is always the same, it simply consists in applying Theorem 5.2.
Remark 5.3. However, some properties can be proved in diﬀerent ways: for instance
Corollary 5.20 can be proved by inserting horseshoes in the dynamics of a given home-
omorphism, using the local modiﬁcation theorem (Theorem 5.40, for a presentation of
the technique in another context see [Gui12, Section 3.3]); also a variation of Corollary
5.15 can be shown in perturbing any given homeomorphism such that it has a periodic
orbit whose distance to the grid EN is smaller than the modulus of continuity of f , so
that the actual periodic orbit and the discrete orbit ﬁt together.

To prove Theorem 5.2, we start from a dense type of approximation – in other
words a sequence of discrete applications – and we want to get properties of homeo-
morphisms. The tool that allows us to restore a homeomorphism from a ﬁnite map
σN : EN → EN is the ﬁnite map extension proposition (Proposition 3.3).
Lemma 5.4. Let U be an open subset 2 of Homeo(X, λ) and T = (TN)N∈N be a type of
approximation which is dense in U . Then for all N0 ∈ N, there exists an open and dense
subset of U on which every homeomorphism f satisﬁes: there exists N ≥ N0 such that the
discretization fN belongs to TN.
Proof of Lemma 5.4. Let f ∈ U , N0 ∈ N and ε > 0. Since T is a type of approximation
which is dense in U , there exists N ≥ N0 and σN ∈ TN such that dN(f , σN) < ε. Let
x1,··· , xqN be the elements of EN. Then for all (cid:96), d(f (x(cid:96)), σN(x(cid:96))) < ε. Now, the problem
is that σN is not injective. To solve this problem, we take advantage of the fact that PN
N : EN → X whose discretization
(cid:48)
is highly non injective to modify σN into a injection σ
(cid:48)
on EN equals to σN: set σ
N(x(cid:96))
(cid:48)
(cid:48)
N(x(cid:96)) is diﬀerent from σ
such that σ
N(x(cid:96))) = PN(σN(x(cid:96))) and
that d(f (x(cid:96)), σ
(cid:48)
N is a bijection, Proposition 3.3 can be applied to f (x(cid:96)) and σ

(cid:48)
N is deﬁned by induction by choosing σ

N(xi) for i ≤ (cid:96), such that PN(σ
(cid:48)

(cid:48)
N(x1) = σN(x1), σ

(cid:48)
N(x(cid:96))) < ε.

Since σ

N(x(cid:96)) for all (cid:96) and such
(cid:48)
N(x(cid:96)) for all (cid:96), and

(x(cid:96)) = σ

Now, proof of Theorem 5.2 is straightforward.

2. In most cases we will take U = Homeo(X, λ).

Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism

This set is clearly a Gδ set and its density follows directly from Lemma 5.4. Moreover
we can easily see that its elements satisfy the conclusions of the theorem.

5.2 Lax’s theorem

Now that we have shown Theorem 5.2, it remains to obtain dense types of approx-
imation. Systematic use will be made of a theorem due to Oxtoby and Ulam [OU41]
but classically referred as Lax’s theorem [Lax71], and more precisely its improvement
as stated by S. Alpern in [Alp76], which allows to approach any conservative homeo-
morphism by a cyclic permutation of the elements of a discretization grid.
Theorem 5.5 (Lax, Alpern). Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and ε > 0. Then there exists N0 ∈ N such
that for all N ≥ N0, there exists a cyclic permutation σN of EN such that dN(f , σN) < ε.

It is worthwhile to note that this theorem was initially stated in the view of nu-
merical approximation of conservative homeomorphisms: P. Lax noticed that in some
pioneering works showing numerical simulations of chaotic dynamical systems (e.g.
[Hén69]), the discretizations of conservative maps were only approximately measure-
preserving. His theorem states that among all possible approximations of a conservative
homeomorphism, some of them are bijective, which is a discrete counterpart of mea-
sure preservation. This theorem was later improved by S. Alpern in [Alp76, Alp78] to
establish generic properties of conservative homeomorphisms (see also [DKP93, KM97]
for a generalisation and some simulations in dimension 1). This theorem is now one
of the keystones of the theory of generic properties of homeomorphisms (see [Gui12]),
together with other theorems of approximation by permutations 3.

As a compact metric set can be seen as a “ﬁnite set up to ε”, Lax’s theorem allows us
to see a homeomorphism as a “cyclic permutation up to ε”. Genericity of transitivity in
Homeo(X, λ) follows easily from Lax’s theorem together with the ﬁnite map extension
proposition (see [AP00] or part 2.4 of [Gui12]). In our case, applying Theorem 5.2,
we deduce that inﬁnitely many discretizations of a generic homeomorphism are cyclic
permutations. The purpose of Section 5.3 is to ﬁnd variations of Lax’s theorem (which
are at the same time corollaries of it) concerning other properties of discretizations.

We give brieﬂy the beautiful proof of Lax’s theorem, which is essentially combina-
torial and based on marriage lemma and on a lemma of approximation of permutations
by cyclic permutations due to S. Alpern. Readers wishing to ﬁnd proofs of these lem-
mas may consult [Gui12, Section 2.1]. It is here that we use the fact that discretizations
grids EN are well distributed and well ordered (see Section 3.6).
Lemma 5.6 (Marriage lemma). Let E and F be two ﬁnite sets and ≈ a relation between
(cid:48) ⊂ E is smaller than the
elements of E and F. Suppose that the number of any subset E

5.3. Individual behaviour of discretizations
then there exists an injection Φ : E → F such that for all e ∈ E, e ≈ Φ(e).
Lemma 5.7 (Cyclic approximations in Sq, [Alp76]). Let q ∈ N∗
and σ ∈ Sq (Sq is seen as
the permutation group of Z/qZ). Then there exists τ ∈ Sq such that |τ(k) − k| ≤ 2 for all k
(where |.| is the distance in Z/qZ) and such that the permutation τσ is cyclic.
Proof of Theorem 5.5. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and ε > 0. Consider N0 ∈ N such that for
all N ≥ N0, the diameter of the cubes of order N (given by the hypothesis “EN is well
distributed”) and their images by f is smaller than ε. We deﬁne a relation ≈ between
cubes of order N − 1: C ≈ C
(cid:48) (cid:44) ∅. Since f preserves λ, the image
(cid:48)
of the union of (cid:96) cubes intersects at least (cid:96) cubes, so the marriage lemma (Lemma 5.6)
applies: there exists an injection ΦN from the set of cubes of order N into itself (then
a bijection) such that for all cube C, f (C) ∩ ΦN(C) (cid:44) ∅. Let σN be the application that
maps the centre of any cube C to the centre of the cube ΦN(C), we obtain:

dN(f , σN) ≤ sup

diam(f (C))

(cid:17) ≤ 2ε.

It remains to show that σN can be chosen as a cyclic permutation. Increasing N
if necessary, and using the hypothesis that the grids are well ordered, we number the
cubes such that the diameter of the union of two consecutive cubes is smaller than
(cid:48)
N whose distance to σN is
ε. Then we use Lemma 5.7 to obtain a cyclic permutation σ
smaller than ε. Thus we have found N0 ∈ N and for all N ≥ N0 a cyclic permutation σ
(cid:48)
N
of EN whose distance to f is smaller than 3ε.
Remark 5.8. In this proof, the marriage lemma can be replaced by Birkhoﬀ’s theorem
about bistochastic matrices: we deﬁne the transition matrix M for the partition of X by
the cubes by mi,j = λ
/λ(Ci); the hypothesis of preservation of λ implies that
M is bistochastic 4. Then, Birkhoﬀ’s theorem ensures that bistochastic matrices form
a convex set whose extremal points are permutation matrices; thus M can be written
as a convex combination of permutation matrices and each one of the corresponding
permutation provides an approximating permutation for f .

5.3 Individual behaviour of discretizations

Now we have set the technical Theorems 5.2 and 5.5, we can establish results con-
cerning the behaviour of discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism.
Here we study individual behaviour of discretizations, i.e. properties about only one
order of discretization. As has already been said, applying Theorem 5.2, it suﬃces to
ﬁnd dense types of approximation to obtain properties about discretizations. In prac-
tice, these dense types of approximations are obtained from variations of Lax’s theorem
(Theorem 5.5).

Recall that the sequence (EN)n∈N of discretization grids is well distributed and well
ordered (see Deﬁnition 3.12), we denote by fN the discretization of a homeomorphism
f and by Ω(fN) the recurrent set of fN (i.e. the union of periodic orbits of fN).

We will show that for a lot of simple dynamical properties (P) about ﬁnite maps
and for a generic conservative homeomorphism f , inﬁnitely many discretizations fN
satisfy (P) as well as inﬁnitely many discretizations satisfy its contrary. For instance, for

Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism

a generic homeomorphism f , the recurrent set Ω(fN) is sometimes as large as possible,
i.e. Ω(fN) = EN (Corollary 5.9), sometimes very small (Corollary 5.15) and even bet-
ter sometimes the number of elements of the image of EN is small (Corollary 5.20). In
the same way stabilization time 5 is sometimes zero (Corollary 5.9, for example), some-
times around Card(EN) (Corollary 5.36). Finally, concerning the dynamics of fN|Ω(fN),
sometimes it is a cyclic permutation (Corollary 5.9) or a bicyclic permutation (Corollary
5.13), sometimes it has many orbits (Corollary 5.22). . .

Firstly, we deduce directly from Lax’s theorem that cyclic permutations of the sets
EN form a dense type of approximation in Homeo(X, λ). Combining this with Theorem
5.2, we obtain directly:
Corollary 5.9 (Miernowski, [Mie05]). For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), for
every N0 ∈ N, there exists N ≥ N0 such that fN is a cyclic permutation 6.

This theorem states that for every generic conservative homeomorphism, there ex-
ists a subsequence of discretizations which are “transitive”. Recall that generic homeo-
morphism are transitive (see [Oxt37]). So, in a certain sense, transitivity can be detected
on discretizations. Remark that this result implies that the discretizations of a generic
conservative homeomorphism do not behave like typical random maps, as for a random
map of a set with q elements the average number of periodic orbits is asymptotically
log q (see for example [Bol01, XIV.5]).

There exists a variation of Lax’s Theorem for bicyclic permutations, which are per-
mutations having exactly two orbits whose lengths are relatively prime (see [Gui12,
lemme 2.9 page 28]); this variation leads to a proof of genericity in Homeo(X, λ) of
topological weak mixing (see for example [AP00] or [Gui12, Part 2.4]). In the following
we deﬁne a discrete analogue to topological weak mixing and state that this property
occurs inﬁnitely often on discretizations of a generic homeomorphism.

Deﬁnition 5.10. A homeomorphism f is said to be topologically weakly mixing if for all
(cid:48)
non-empty open sets (Ui)i≤M and (U
i is
non-empty for all i ≤ M.

i )i≤M, there exists m ∈ N such that f m(Ui) ∩ U
(cid:48)

The proof of the genericity of topological weak mixing starts by an approximation
of every conservative homeomorphism by another having ε-dense periodic orbits whose
lengths are relatively prime. The end of the proof primarily involves the use of Baire’s
theorem and Bézout’s identity. In the discrete case, the notion of weak mixing is re-
placed by the following.

Deﬁnition 5.11. Let ε > 0. A ﬁnite map σN is said ε-topologically weakly mixing if for all
M ∈ N and all balls (Bi)i≤M and (B
i)i≤M with diameter ε, there exists m ∈ N such that for

Proposition 5.12 (First variation of Lax’s theorem). Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) be a homeomor-
phism such that all the iterates of f are topologically transitive. Then for all ε > 0 and all
M ∈ N∗
, there exists N0 ∈ N such that for all N ≥ N0, there exists σN : EN → EN which
has M ε-dense periodic orbits whose lengths are pairwise relatively prime, and such that
dN(f , σN) < ε.

Proof of Proposition 5.12. We prove the proposition in the case where M = 2, the other
cases being easily obtained by an induction. Let ε > 0 and f be a homeomorphism whose
all iterates are topologically transitive. Then there exists x0 ∈ X and p ∈ N∗
such that
{x0,··· , f p−1(x0)} is ε-dense and d(x0, f p(x0)) < ε/2. Since transitive points of f p form a
dense Gδ subset of X, while the orbit of x0 form a Fσ set with empty interior, the set of
points whose orbit under f p is dense and disjoint from that of x0 is dense. So we can
pick such a transitive point y0. Set y1 = f (y0). Then there exists a multiple q1 of p such
that the orbit {y1,··· , f q1−1(y1)} is ε-dense and d(y1, f q1(y1)) < ε/2. Again, by density,
we can choose a transitive point y2 whose orbit is disjoint from that of x0 and y1, with
d(y1, y2) < ε/2 and d(y0, y1)−d(y0, y2) > ε/4. Then there exists a multiple q2 of p such that
d(y2, f q2(y2)) < ε/2. And so on, we construct a sequence (ym)1≤m≤(cid:96) such that (see ﬁgure
5.1):
(i) for all m, there exists qm > 0 such that p|qm and d(ym, f qm(ym)) < ε/2,
(ii) the orbits {x0,··· , f p−1(x0)} and {ym,··· , f qm−1(ym)} (m going from 0 to (cid:96) − 1) are
(iii) for all m, d(ym, ym+1) < ε/2 and d(y0, ym)− d(y0, ym+1) > ε/4,
(iv) y(cid:96) = y0.
the same properties (i) to (iii) than f . Changing σN at the points σqm−1

there exists N ≥ N0 such that fN is ε-topologically weakly mixing.

Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism

Proof of Corollary 5.13. Again, we prove the corollary in the case where M = 2, other
cases being easily obtained by induction. Let ε > 0 and N0 ∈ N. All iterates of a generic
homeomorphism f are topologically transitive: it is an easy consequence of the generic-
ity of transitivity (see for example Corollary 5.9 or [Gui12, Theorem 2.11]); we pick such
a homeomorphism. Combining Theorem 5.2 and Proposition 5.12, we obtain N ≥ N0
such that fN has two ε/3-dense periodic orbits whose lengths p et q are coprime. We
(cid:48)
(cid:48)
1 and B
now have to prove that fN is ε-topologically weakly mixing. Let B1, B2, B
2 be
balls with diameter ε. Since each one of these orbits is ε/3-dense, there exists xN ∈ X
which is in the intersection of the orbit whose length is p and B1, and yN ∈ X which
is in the intersection of the orbit whose length is q and B2. Similarly, there exists two
integers a and b such that f a

Recall that we want to ﬁnd a power of fN which sends both xN in B

It suﬃces to pick m ∈ N such that m = a + αp = b + βq. Bézout’s identity states that there
exists two integers α and β such αp − βq = b − a. Set m = a + αp, adding a multiple of pq
if necessary, we can suppose that m is positive. Thus f m

For now, the two approximation types we studied concern analogues of properties
that are generic among Homeo(X, λ). We now show that some discrete analogues of
properties that are not generic among conservative homeomorphisms also occur in-
ﬁnitely often in the discretizations of generic homeomorphisms. The second variation
of Lax’s theorem concerns the approximation of applications whose recurrent set is
small.

A direct application of Theorem 5.2 leads to the following corollary.

Speciﬁcally for all ε > 0 and all N0 ∈ N,
such that

We now improve this corollary in stating that for a generic homeomorphism, there
exists C > 0 such that we have Card(Ω(fN)) ≤ C for an inﬁnite number of orders N;
in particular these discretizations are highly non transitive, which is the opposite be-
haviour to the dynamics of a generic homeomorphism.

= 0.
there exists N ≥ N0

The same kind of idea than in the proof of Proposition 5.14 leads to the following

variation of Lax’s theorem.
Proposition 5.16. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) having at least one periodic point x of period p.
Then for all ε > 0, there exists N0 ∈ N such that for all N ≥ N0, there exists an application
σN : EN → EN with dN(f , σN) < ε, such that EN is made of a unique (pre-periodic) orbit of
σN and such that the unique periodic orbit of fN is of length p and ε-shadows the f -orbit of
x.

Proof of proposition 5.16. Simply replace the recurrent point by a periodic point of pe-
riod p in the proof of Proposition 5.14.

We will use this proposition in Section 5.5 to obtain Theorem 5.36. In particular, it

will imply the following statement.

76
Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism
Corollary 5.17. For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), for every period p of a
periodic point of f and for inﬁnitely many integers N, fN has a unique periodic orbit, whose
length is p, and such that EN is covered by a single (pre-periodic) orbit of fN.

Remark 5.18. In particular, if p0 denotes the minimal period of the periodic points of f ,
then there are inﬁnitely many discretizations such that the cardinality of their recurrent
set is equal to p0. Note that however, the shortest period of periodic points of generic
homeomorphisms has no global upper bound in Homeo(X, λ): for example, for all p ∈ N,
there is an open set of homeomorphisms of the torus without periodic point of period
less than p (e.g. the neighbourhood of an irrational rotation) and this property remains
true for discretizations.

Corollary 5.17 states that for a generic homeomorphism, Card(Ω(fN))/ Card(EN) is
as small as possible for an inﬁnite number of orders N. The next result states that this
loss of injectivity can even occur from the ﬁrst iteration of fN.
Proposition 5.19 (Third variation of Lax’s theorem). Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and ϑ : N →

So far all variations of Lax’s theorem have constructed ﬁnite maps with a small num-
ber of cycles. With the additional assumption that the sequence of grids is sometimes
self similar, we show a ﬁnal variation of Lax’s theorem, approaching every homeomor-
phism by a ﬁnite map with a large number of orbits.

Proposition 5.21 (Fourth variation of Lax’s theorem). Assume that the sequence of grids
(EN)N∈N is sometimes self similar. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and ϑ : N → R such that ϑ(N) =
o(qN). Then for all ε > 0, there exists N1 ∈ N such that for all N ≥ N1, there exists a
permutation σN of EN such that dN(f , σN) < ε and that the number of cycles of σN is greater
than ϑ(N). Moreover, ϑ(N) of these cycles of σN are conjugated to a cyclic permutation of EN0
by bijections whose distance to identity is smaller than ε.

Proof of Proposition 5.21. Let ε > 0, for all N0 ∈ N large enough, Lax’s theorem gives

Since the distance between hj and identity is smaller than ε, we have dN(f , σN) < 2ε.
Moreover, σN has at least ϑ(N) cycles which are conjugated to a cyclic permutation of
EN0 by the maps hj; this completes the proof.

The application of Theorem 5.2 leads to the following corollary, which ensures that

an inﬁnite number of discretizations fN have a lot of periodic orbits.
Corollary 5.22. We still assume that the sequence of grids (EN)N∈N is sometimes self similar.
Let ϑ : N → R such that ϑ(N) = o(qN). Then for a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ)
and for inﬁnitely many integers N, the discretization fN of f has at least ϑ(N) periodic orbits
(which all have the same period).

If we compose the map obtained by Proposition 5.21 by an appropriate map of the

ﬁnite set {hi(x0)}i into itself (x0 being ﬁxed), we can prove the following result.
Proposition 5.23. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), ε > 0 and ]a, b[⊂ [0,1]. Then there exists N1 ∈ N
such that for all N ≥ N1, there exists a permutation σN of EN such that dN(f , σN) < ε and
that the degree of recurrence of σN (that is, the ratio between the cardinality of the recurrent
set of σN and the cardinality of EN) belongs to ]a, b[.

This proposition implies trivially the following corollary.

Corollary 5.24. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), the sequence
D(fN) of the degrees of recurrence of the discretizations accumulates on the whole segment
[0,1].

5.4 Average behaviour of discretizations

We now want to study the average behaviour of discretizations of a generic homeo-
morphism. For example, we could imagine that even if for a generic homeomorphism
f , the event “fN is a cyclic permutation” appears for inﬁnitely many orders N, it is
statistically quite rare.

More precisely, we study the frequency of occurrence of properties related to the
discretizations of generic homeomorphisms: given a property (P) concerning discretiza-
tions, we are interested in the behaviour of the proportion between 1 and M of dis-
cretizations satisfying the property (P), when M goes to inﬁnity. For this study, we
assume that the sequence of discretization grids is always self similar (which is true
for example for the torus equipped with discretizations upon uniform grids of orders
powers of an integer, see Section 3.7). This prevents us from having to deal with tricky
arithmetic problems about overlay of grids.
Deﬁnition 5.25. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ). We say that a property (P) concerning discretiza-
tions is satisﬁed in average if for all N0 ∈ N and all ε > 0, there exists N ≥ N0 such that

78

(cid:111)

We will show that most of the dynamical properties studied in the previous section
are actually satisﬁed on average for generic homeomorphisms. To start with, we set out
a technical lemma:

Lemma 5.26. Let T be a dense type of approximation in Homeo(X, λ). Then for a generic
homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), for all ε > 0 and all α > 0, the property (P): “EN contains
at least α disjoints subsets which ﬁlls a proportion greater than 1 − ε of EN, each of them
stabilized by fN and such that the restriction of fN to each one is conjugated to a map of T
by a bijection whose distance to identity is smaller than ε” is satisﬁed in average.

In practice, this lemma provides many properties satisﬁed on average, for instance:
– quantitative properties on discretizations, such as possessing at least M periodic

orbits;

– properties of existence of sub-dynamics on discretizations, such as possessing at

least one dense periodic orbit.

to f is smaller than δ and an integer N ≥ N0 such that

It is simply obtained in combining the density of the type of approximation T and the
fact that the sequence of grids is always self similar.

This lemma allows us to obtain some properties about the average behaviour of

discretizations. For instance here is an improvement of Corollary 5.36.
Corollary 5.27. For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), the property “fN has a ε-
dense periodic orbit and the cardinality of Ω(fN) satisﬁes Card(Ω(fN)) = o(qN)” is satisﬁed
in average.

Or an improvement of Corollary 5.13.

Corollary 5.28. For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and for all ε > 0, the prop-
erty “fN is ε-topologically weakly mixing” (see Deﬁnition 5.11) is satisﬁed in average.

Or even an improvement of Corollary 5.20.

Corollary 5.29. For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and for all ε > 0, the prop-
erty “ Card(fN(EN))

Card(EN) < ε” is satisﬁed in average.

And an improvement of Corollary 5.22.

Corollary 5.30. For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and for all M ∈ N, property
“fN has at least M periodic orbits” is satisﬁed in average.

However, note that the most simple property about discretizations, i.e. being a cyclic
permutation, cannot be proved by using Lemma 5.26. To do this, we need a slightly
more precise result, that requires the hypothesis that the grids are always strongly self
similar.
Theorem 5.31. For a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), the property “fN is a cyclic
permutation” is satisﬁed in average.

Note that this implies that most of the discretizations of f does not behave like a
random map of a set of cardinality qN, as a random map of a set with q elements has in
average log q periodic orbits (see for example [Bol01, XIV.5]).
Lemma 5.32. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and ε > 0. The sequence of grids is supposed to be
always strongly self similar. Then there exists N0 ∈ N such that for all N ≥ N0, there exists a
permutation σN of EN, such that dN(f , σN) < ε, σN|EN0
is a cyclic permutation of EN0 and for
all M ∈ {N0,··· , N − 1}, σN is a cyclic permutation of EM+1 \ EM.

Figure 5.3: Construction 7 of Lemma 5.32 for two grids of orders 3 and 6 and zoom
around a point of a grid of order 3

Proof of Lemma 5.32. Applying Lax’s theorem (Theorem 5.5), we can ﬁnd an integer N0
and a cyclic permutation σN0 of EN0 such that dN0(f , σN0) < ε. As the sequence of grids
is always strongly self similar, we can suppose that N0 is big enough to verify the con-
clusions of Deﬁnition 3.13.
Let us observe what happens for the order N0 + 1. We will deﬁne an application
(cid:48)
(cid:48)
N0+1 on EN0+1, which will be close to the homeomorphism f . On EN0, we deﬁne σ
σ
N0+1
as being equal to σN0. The idea is to repeat the proof of Lax’s theorem for the elements
of EN0+1 \ EN0. To do that, we have to ﬁnd a partition of X into sets with the same
measure, such that every element Ax of this partition is one to one associated to a point
x of EN0+1 \ EN0, and has “small” diameter. So it suﬃces to split equitably the mass of
the cubes EN0 to the other cubes.

7. Do not forget that we identify some points of the boundary!

Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism

mutation σ

We ﬁnish the proof by an induction, iterating N − N0 times.

For this purpose, we cut each cube of EN0+1 corresponding to a point xN0 of the grid
EN into αN − 1 subsets of the same measure 1/(qN0+1(αN − 1)) (see Figure 5.3). Each
of these subsets is assigned to the cube corresponding to the point hi(xN0). For each
x ∈ EN0+1 \ EN0, we deﬁne Ax as the union of the cube Cx with the subset that is asso-
ciated to it. Then all the sets Ax have the same measure and have a diameter smaller
than twice the diameter of a cube of EN0+1 plus ε. We can now apply Lax’s theorem to
the homeomorphism f and the partition {Ax}x∈EN of X, this partition being numbered
the same way as the partition EN0+1 (some numbers are skipped); this gives a cyclic
permutation of EN0+1 \ EN0 which is close to f . This cyclic permutation deﬁnes the per-
(cid:48)
(cid:48)
N0+1 is close to f and permutes cyclically
N0+1 where it was not yet. This σ
the elements of EN0 and these of EN0+1 \ EN0.
Corollary 5.33. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and ε > 0 (we recall that the sequence of grids is
supposed to be always strongly self similar). Then there exists N0 ∈ N such that for all
N ≥ N0, there exists a homeomorphism g whose distance to f is smaller than ε such that
for all M ∈ {N,··· , N0}, the discretization gM is a cyclic permutation of EM. Moreover, this
property can be supposed to be veriﬁed on a neighbourhood of g.
Proof of Corollary 5.33. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and ε > 0. Lemma 5.32 gives us an integer
N0 ∈ N such that for all N ≥ N0, there exists a permutation σN of EN, whose distance
to f is smaller than ε/2, such that σN is a cyclic permutation of EN0 and for all M ∈
{N0 +1,··· , N}, σM is a cyclic permutation of EM\EM−1. Set N ≥ N0, the idea is to modify
slightly the orbits of σN such that σN becomes a cyclic permutation on all the sets EM.

of two adjacent points lying in the grids EM et EM+1. Then, for all M ∈ {N0,··· , N}, the
discretization of σM−1
on EM is a cyclic permutation. Moreover, the distance between
the map σN
N and σN is smaller than ε/2. Combined with Proposition 3.3, this allows
us to interpolate σN
N to a homeomorphism g whose distance to f is smaller than ε such
that for all M ∈ {N0,··· , N}, the discretization of order M of g is a cyclic permutation
of EM. A careful reader would notice that it may happen that in this construction, the
discretizations of g are not uniquely deﬁned; depending on the choices made during
(cid:48)
N, these discretizations may not be cyclic permutations. If we
the deﬁnition of PN on E
want to avoid this problem, it suﬃces to modify slightly the map σM
N ; moreover this
ensures that the conclusions of the corollary are veriﬁed on a whole neighbourhood of
g.

5.5 Behaviour of all the discretizations

In the previous sections, we showed that the dynamical behaviour of discretizations
depends drastically on the order of discretization: even when looking at the frequency a
property appears on discretizations, a lot of diﬀerent behaviours can occur. In contrast,
the dynamics of a generic homeomorphism is well known (see for example [Gui12])
and “independent from the homeomorphism”. We even have a 0-1 law on Homeo(X, λ)
(see [GK98] or the ﬁnal chapter of [Gui12]) which states that either a given ergodic
property is generic among conservative homeomorphisms, or its contrary is generic.
Thus, the dynamics of a generic homeomorphism and that of its discretizations seem
quite of independent. In this chapter, we will see that the variations of the dynamics
of the discretizations are as large as possible. Indeed, in general, from the convergence
dN(f , fN) → 0, it can be deduced by a compactness argument that the accumulation
set of the dynamical invariants (for example, invariant measures) of fN is included in
that of f . We will see that in the generic case, the inverse inclusion is also true: every
dynamical invariant of f is an accumulation point of the corresponding dynamical in-
variants of fN. Thus, in a certain sense, it is possible to deduce some dynamical features
of a generic homeomorphism from the corresponding dynamical features of all its dis-
cretizations. In other words, there is a shadowing property of the dynamical features
of the homeomorphism by that of its discretizations: for each dynamical feature of the
homeomorphism, its discrete analogues appear on an inﬁnite number of discretizations.
For example, we will show that every periodic orbit of f is shadowed by a peri-
odic orbit of an inﬁnite number of fN (Theorem 5.36). We will also show that every
f -invariant measure is the limit of a subsequence of fN-invariant measures (Theorem
5.43), and every f -invariant chain transitive compact set is the limit of a subsequence of
fN-invariant sets (Theorem 5.47). Moreover, in Chapter 6, we will give an application

82

Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism

of this convergence of all the dynamics of the discretizations to that of the homeomor-
phism. This will give an algorithm to obtain numerically the rotation set of a generic
conservative homeomorphism: the upper limit (for the inclusion) of the rotation sets
of the discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism of the torus is equal to
the rotation set of the homeomorphism itself (see Corollary 6.23).

5.5.1 Periodic orbits

Firstly, we deduce from Proposition 5.16 that every periodic orbit of a generic home-
omorphism is shadowed by a periodic orbit with the same period of an inﬁnite number
of discretizations. We will see later that this property of shadowing is true for a larger
class of compact sets (namely the chain transitive invariant compact sets, see Theorem
5.47), but the following theorem is also concerned with the period of the periodic orbits
of the discretizations. Moreover, the case of periodic orbits seems natural enough to be
handled separately.
Theorem 5.36. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) be a generic homeomorphism. Then, for every periodic
point x of period p for f , for every δ > 0 and for every N0 ∈ N, there exists N ≥ N0 such that
fN has a unique periodic orbit, whose length is p, which δ-shadows the f -orbit of x, and such
that EN is covered by a single (pre-periodic) orbit of fN (in particular, this implies that this
periodic orbit attracts the whole set EN).

In particular, this theorem implies that it is possible to detect the periods of the

periodic orbits of a generic homeomorphism from that of its discretizations.

Corollary 5.37. Let f be a generic homeomorphism of Homeo(X, λ) and p be an integer.
Then f has a periodic orbit of period p if and only if there exists inﬁnitely many integers N
such that fN has a periodic orbit with period p.

Proof of Corollary 5.37. The ﬁrst implication is Corollary 5.36, and the other follows
easily from a compactness argument.

F. Daalderop and R. Fokkink have proved in [DF00] (see also [Gui12, Part 3.2], the
proof is similar to that of Theorem 5.36) that for a generic element of f ∈ Homeo(X, λ),
the set of f -periodic points is dense in X.

To prove Theorem 5.36, the concept of persistent point will allow us to deﬁne open

properties about periodic points.
Deﬁnition 5.38. Let f ∈ Homeo(X). A periodic point x of f with period p is said persis-
such that every(cid:101)f ∈ V has a periodic point(cid:101)x ∈ U with period p.
tent if for all neighbourhood U of x, there exists a neighbourhood V of f in Homeo(X)
Example 5.39. The endomorphism h = Diag(λ1,··· , λn) of Rn, with(cid:81) λi = 1 and λi (cid:44) 1

for all i, is measure-preserving and has a persistent ﬁxed point at the origin (see for
example [KH95, page 319]). Let s be a reﬂection of Rn, the application h ◦ s is also
measure-preserving and has a persistent ﬁxed point at the origin.

To create persistent periodic points, we use the theorem of local modiﬁcation of
conservative homeomorphisms, which allows to replace locally a homeomorphism by
another. Although it seems “obvious” and has an elementary proof in dimension two,
the proof in higher dimensions uses the (diﬃcult) annulus theorem. For more details we
may refer to [DF00] or [Gui12, Part 3.1].

Theorem 5.40 (Local modiﬁcation). Let σ1, σ2, τ1 and τ2 be four bicollared embeddings 8
of Sn−1 in Rn, such that σ1 is in the bounded connected component 9 of σ2 and τ1 is in
the bounded connected component of τ2. Let A1 be the bounded connected component of
Rn \ σ1 and B1 the bounded connected component of Rn \ τ1; Σ be the connected component
of Rn\ (σ1∪ σ2) having σ1∪ σ2 as boundary and Λ the connected component of Rn\ (τ1∪ τ2)
having τ1∪ τ2 as boundary; A2 be the unbounded connected component of Rn\ σ2 and B2 the
unbounded connected component of Rn \ τ2 (see Figure 5.4).
Suppose that Leb(A1) = Leb(B1) and Leb(Σ) = Leb(Λ). Let fi : Ai → Bi be two measure-
preserving homeomorphisms such that either each one preserves the orientation, or each one
reverses it. Then there exists a measure-preserving homeomorphism f : Rn → Rn whose
restriction to A1 equals f1 and restriction to A2 equals f2.

Since this theorem is local, it can be applied to an open space O instead of Rn or,
even better, together with the Oxtoby-Ulam theorem (Theorem 3.14), to any domain of
chart of a manifold X instead of Rn and measure λ instead of Lebesgue measure.

By perturbing a homeomorphism, we can make every periodic point persistent, as

stated by the following lemma.
Lemma 5.41. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), ε > 0, δ > 0 and P ∈ N. Then there exists g ∈
Homeo(X, λ) such that d(f , g) < δ and such that for every f -periodic point x of period smaller
than P, there exists a persistent periodic point of g with the same period which ε-shadows the
f -orbit of x.

Proof of Lemma 5.41. Indeed, by compactness of the set of compact subsets of X en-
dowed with Hausdorﬀ topology, it suﬃces to prove it only for a ﬁnite number of f -
periodic orbits. If for each of these periodic orbits, we perform the perturbation of f
outside of a neighbourhood of the other periodic orbits, we reduce the proof to the case
of a single periodic orbit. More formally, we choose a neighbourhood D of x such that
the sets D, f (D),··· , f p−1(D) are pairwise disjoints (and disjoint from a neighbourhood
of the others periodic orbits) and we locally replace f by the map h ◦ f
−(p−1) (where h
−(p−1) preserves orien-
is one of the two maps of Example 5.39, depending of whether f
−1(x), using the theorem of local modiﬁcation
tation or not) in the neighbourhood of f
(Theorem 5.40), such that f do not change outside the union of the sets f i(D).

two connected components: one bounded and one unbounded.

84
Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism
Proof of Theorem 5.36. We choose a basis {Ck} of the topology of X. Now, for p, N, k ∈ N,
we deﬁne the set Up,N,k as the set of f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) such that if f possesses a persistent
periodic point of period p which intersects Ck, then fN has a unique injective orbit
whose periodic orbit intersects Ck and has length p. Note that the fact that we consider
persistent periodic points ensures that these sets are open.

Then, the combination of Proposition 5.16, Lemma 5.4 and Lemma 5.41 implies that

is a dense Gδ of Homeo(X, λ), consisting of the homeomorphisms that verify the conclu-

5.5.2 Invariant measures

We now try to obtain information about invariant measures of a generic homeomor-
phism from invariant measures of its discretizations. More precisely, given all the in-
variant measures of discretizations of a generic homeomorphism, what can be deduced
about invariant measures of the initial homeomorphism? A ﬁrst step in this study was
taken in 2006 by T. Miernowski in [Mie06, Part 8]:
Proposition 5.42. Let f ∈ Homeo(X). For all N ∈ N let γN ⊂ EN be a periodic cycle of
fN and νN the uniform probability measure on γN. Then, any limit point of the sequence of
measures (νN)N is f -invariant.

In particular, if f is uniquely ergodic, whose unique invariant probability measure is

denoted by µ, then the sequence of measures (νN)N tends to µ.

The proof of this proposition essentially consists in an appropriate use of the com-
pactness of the set of probability measures on X. We now state the same kind of result
for generic homeomorphisms.
Theorem 5.43. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) be a generic homeomorphism and suppose that the
sequence of grids (EN)N∈N is sometimes strongly self similar. Then for every f -invariant
measure µ, there exists a subsequence νNk of fNk-invariant periodic measures such that (νNk)k
tends to µ.

This result is a particular case of the more general Theorem 5.45, for which we will

need the following notation.
Notation 5.44. For f ∈ Homeo(X), we denote by M f the set of Borel probability mea-
sures on X which are invariant under f , and by M f
N the set of Borel probability measures
on EN which are invariant under fN
Theorem 5.45. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) be a generic homeomorphism and suppose that the
sequence of grids (EN)N∈N is sometimes strongly self similar. Let MN be the set of probability
measures on EN that are invariant under fN. Then for every closed and convex subset M of
f -invariant measures, there exists a subsequence of {MN} which tends to M for Hausdorﬀ
topology.

Proposition 5.42 asserts that the upper limit of the sets of measures that are in-
variant under fN is included in the set of f -invariant measures. As the set of fN-
invariant measures is always convex, Theorem 5.45 asserts that generically, the sets
of fN-invariant measures accumulate on all the possible sets of measures.

5.5. Behaviour of all the discretizations

85

Before giving a detailed proof of Theorem 5.45, let us give its main arguments. An
ad hoc application of Baire’s theorem, together with compactness arguments, reduces
the proof to that of the following variation of Lax’s theorem, which asserts that for
every ﬁnite collection M of measures that are invariant under f , there exists a homeo-
morphism g which is close to f and a big order of discretization N such that the set of
periodic measures that are invariant under gN is close to M for Hausdorﬀ distance.

Lemma 5.46 (Ergodic variation of Lax’s theorem). Suppose that the sequence of grids
(EN)N∈N is sometimes strongly self similar. Then, for all f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), for all collection of
f -invariant measures ν1,··· , ν(cid:96), for all ε > 0 and all k0, N0 ∈ N, there exists g ∈ Homeo(X, λ)
and N ≥ N0 such that d(f , g) < ε, and that gN possesses exactly (cid:96) periodic orbits, and the
} supported by these periodic orbits satisfy
the invariant periodic measures {νg
dist(νi, νg
for all i. Moreover, we can suppose that these properties are still true
on a whole neighbourhood of g.

For the proof of Theorem 5.45, we will need a slightly weaker result; however this

lemma will also be useful in the next part concerning the physical dynamics.

Before giving the formal proof of Lemma 5.46, we sketch its main arguments. Sup-
pose ﬁrst that (cid:96) = 1 and that ν1 is ergodic. For this purpose we apply Birkhoﬀ’s theorem
to f , ν1 and a recurrent point x: for all M large enough,

N is the uniform measure on the orbit xN,··· , σM−1

Since x is recurrent we can choose an integer M large enough such that x (cid:39) f M(x). First
we approximate f by a cyclic permutation σN given by Lax’s theorem, then we slightly
N (xN)) = xN, as in Proposition 5.14. The
modify σN into a map σ
N (xN), so it is close to ν1; we
measure ν
then just have to apply the proposition of extension of ﬁnite maps to ﬁnish the proof in
the case where (cid:96) = 1 and ν1 ergodic. The proof of the lemma when ν1 is not ergodic but
only invariant is obtained by approximating the invariant measure by a ﬁnite convex
combination of ergodic measures. We use the hypothesis of self similarity of the grids
to apply the previous process on each subgrid; we approximate each ergodic measure of
the convex combination on a number of subgrids proportional to the coeﬃcient of this
measure in the convex combination. We then make a ﬁnal perturbation to merge the
periodic orbits of the diﬀerent subgrids and apply the proposition of extension of ﬁnite
maps; this proves the case (cid:96) = 1. Finally, the general case (when there are several mea-
sures to approximate) is obtained is using (again) the fact that the grids are sometimes
strongly self similar.

Proof of Theorem 5.45. Recall that we denote by P the set of all Borel probability mea-
sures on X and that P is equipped with a distance dist compatible with the weak-*
topology. The set of compact sets of Borel probability measures on X is equipped with
the Hausdorﬀ distance distH which makes this set compact; we consider a sequence
{M(cid:96)}(cid:96) of compact sets of Borel probability measures which is dense for this topology.

In the general case the measure ν is only invariant (and not ergodic). So in the

a compact convex set whose extremal points are exactly the ergodic measures: by the

point xN belonging to this orbit, its orbit distributes like the measure ν1 during a time

covers the rest of the orbit during a (small) time proportional to 1/P. Thus, increasing
(cid:48)
(cid:48)(cid:48)
N (therefore P) if necessary, it means that the distance between the measures µσ
N and ν
is smaller than 1/k0. To ﬁnish the proof of the lemma when there is only one measure
(cid:48)(cid:48)
to approximate, it suﬃces to interpolate the map σ
N by a homeomorphism close to f in
applying the proposition of extension of ﬁnite maps (Proposition 3.3).

To treat the case where there are several measures to approximate, we use once more
the fact that the grids are sometimes strongly self similar. On each of the subgrids, (and
considering sub-subgrids if necessary), we apply the process of the previous part of the
proof, and apply the proposition of extension of ﬁnite maps to ﬁnd a homeomorphism
which satisﬁes the conclusions of the lemma.

5.5.3 Invariant compact sets

There is a similarity between invariant measures and invariant compact sets, thus
the previous theorem is also true for invariant compact sets. As in the previous section,
we begin by a particular case of the main theorem of this section (Theorem 5.49).
Theorem 5.47. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) be a generic homeomorphism and suppose that the
sequence of grids (EN)N∈N is sometimes strongly self similar. Then for every f -invariant
chain transitive compact set K ⊂ X, there exists a subsequence KNk of fNk-periodic orbits
which tends to K for Hausdorﬀ topology.

In the ergodic case, the set of invariant measures of a given map had to be closed and
convex; concerning compact sets, there are also conditions for a collection of compact
sets to be the set of compact invariant sets of a map. This motivates the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5.48. Let f ∈ Homeo(X). We say that a set K of compact subsets of X that
are invariant under f is admissible for f if there exists K0 ⊂ K such that:
(i) every K0 ∈ K0 is chain transitive;
(ii) every K ∈ K is a ﬁnite union of elements of K0.
Theorem 5.49. Let f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) be a generic homeomorphism and suppose that the
sequence of grids (EN)N∈N is sometimes strongly self similar. Let KN be the set of compact
subsets of EN that are invariant under fN. Then for every collection K of compact subsets of
X that is admissible for f , there exists a subsequence of KN which tends to K for Hausdorﬀ
topology 10.

Like in the ergodic case, this theorem expresses that the sets of invariant compact

sets for fN accumulate on all the admissible sets of invariant sets for f .

The proof of Theorem 5.49 is very similar to that of Theorem 5.45. An appropriate
application of Baire’s theorem reduces the proof to that of the following variation of
Lax’s theorem.
Lemma 5.50 (Compact variation of Lax’s theorem). Suppose that the sequence of grids
(EN)N∈N is sometimes strongly self similar. For all f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), for all collection K
of compact subsets of X that is admissible for f , for all ε > 0 and k0, N0 ∈ N, there exists
g ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and N ≥ N0 such that d(f , g) < ε, and that the set of gN-invariant sets 11 on
10. That is, Hausdorﬀ topology on the sets of compacts subsets of X endowed with Hausdorﬀ distance.
11. Which consists of unions of periodic orbits of gN.

Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism

EN is 1/k0-close to K for Hausdorﬀ distance. Moreover, we can suppose that these properties
are satisﬁed on a whole neighbourhood of g.

Sketch of proof of Lemma 5.50. The proof is very similar to that of Lemma 5.46. We take
a collection K of compact subsets of X which is admissible for f . By compactness of K ,
it is close for Hausdorﬀ topology to a ﬁnite set {K1}∪···∪{Kp}. Then, every compact set
Ki is close to a ﬁnite union ˜K1

5.6 Physical dynamics

In the previous section, we proved that generically, the upper limit of the sets of in-
variant measures of discretizations is the set of invariant measures of the initial home-
omorphism. This expresses that the sets of invariant measures of discretizations accu-
mulate on “the biggest possible set”. However, we might expect that physical measures
– that is, Borel measures which attracts a lot of points with respect to λ (see Deﬁnition
3.9 page 45) – play a speciﬁc part: their deﬁnition expresses that they are the mea-
sures that can be observed in practice on numerical experiments, because they governs
the ergodic behaviour of λ almost every point 12; in the case of a generic conservative
homeomorphism, Oxtoby-Ulam theorem [OU41] implies that λ is the unique physical
measure. Moreover, results of stochastic stability are known to be true in various con-
texts (for example, expanding maps [Kif86a],[Kif86b], [Kel82], uniformly hyperbolic
attractors [Kif86b], [You86]. . . ). These theorems suggest that the physical measures can
always be observed in practice, even if the system is noisy. Given this background, we
are tempted to think that the natural invariant measures µfN
X of fN, which can be seen
as the physical measures of fN, converge to the physical measures of f .

Recall that µfN

X is the limit in the sense of Cesàro of the pushforwards by iterates of

fN of uniform measure λN on EN (see Deﬁnition 3.10 page 46):

m−1(cid:88)

µfN
X = lim

(fN)i∗λN.

The measure µfN
X is supported by the recurrent set of fN; it is uniform on every periodic
orbit and the total weight of a periodic orbit is proportional to the size of its basin of
attraction.

The expectation that the measure λ plays a speciﬁc part is supported by the fol-
X : if f is uniquely
X converge weakly to the only measure µ that is invariant under

lowing variation of Proposition 5.42, obtained by replacing νN by µfN
ergodic, then the measures µfN
f .

Unfortunately, we show that this is not at all the case: the sequence of measures
X ) accumulates of the whole set of f -invariant measures. More precisely we have the

(µfN
following theorem:

Theorem 5.51. If the sequence of grids (EN)N∈N is sometimes strongly self similar, then for
a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), the set of limit points of the sequence (µfN
X )N∈N
is exactly the set of f -invariant measures.

This theorem can be seen as a discretized version of the following conjecture.

Conjecture 5.52 (F. Abdenur, M. Andersson, [AA13]). A homeomorphism f which is
generic in the set of homeomorphisms of X (without measure preserving hypothesis) that
do not have any open trapping set is wicked, i.e. it is not uniquely ergodic and the measures

m−1(cid:88)

k=0

accumulate on the whole set of invariant measures under f .

The behaviour described in this conjecture is the opposite of that consisting of pos-

sessing a physical measure.

Sketch of proof of theorem 5.51. The proof is similar to which of theorem 5.45: the set A
is replaced by

and {ν(cid:96)} is a countable set of Borel probability measures that is dense in the whole set
of Borel probability measures. A direct application of Lemma 5.46 leads to the fact that
every set O(cid:96),N0,k0 is open and dense.

We have also another corollary of Lemma 5.46 about physical dynamics, which can

be seen as a combination of Theorem 5.51 and of a discrete Birkhoﬀ’s theorem.
Theorem 5.53. If the sequence of grids (EN)N∈N is sometimes strongly self similar, then for a
generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ) and for every f -invariant measure µ, there exists
a subsequence fNk of discretizations such that for every x ∈ X, the sequence of measures 13

fNk

µ

tends to µ.

In particular, this theorem asserts that it is impossible to detect the physical measure
of a generic conservative homeomorphism by looking at the physical measures of its
discretizations:
Remark 5.54. This seems to contradict the empirical observations made by A. Boyarsky
in 1986 (see [Boy86] or [GB88]): when a homeomorphism f has only one ergodic mea-
sure µ which is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure, “most of” the
measures µfN
x tend to measure µ. However, the author does not specify in what sense he
means “most of the points”, or if his remark is based on a tacit assumption of regularity
for f .

Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism

Note that as in the previous section, we have a compact counterpart of Theo-

rem 5.51:
Theorem 5.55. If the sequence of grids (EN)N∈N is sometimes strongly self similar, then for a
generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(X, λ), the set of limit points of the sequence (Ω(fN))N∈N
is exactly the set of limit points of ﬁnite unions of f -invariant chain transitive compact sets.

5.7 Addendum: generic conjugates and generic grids

In this addendum we want to adapt the proofs of this chapter to the case of dis-
cretizations of conjugated generic homeomorphisms. More precisely, we ﬁx a conser-
−1,
vative homeomorphism f and we look at the dynamics of the discretizations of hf h
where h is a generic conservative homeomorphism. This is equivalent to ﬁx a dynamics
f and to wonder what is the dynamics of the discretizations of generic realizations of f .
Another point of view is to see these discretizations as discretizations of a ﬁxed home-
omorphism on a generic sequence of grids, where by deﬁnition a generic sequence of
grids is the image of a good sequence of grids by a generic homeomorphism.

The following property is a ﬁnite maps extension result for conjugations of a given
homeomorphism. It implies that under some weak hypothesis, the results are the same
for generic conjugations of a ﬁxed homeomorphism and for generic conservative home-
omorphisms.

Proposition 5.56. Let f be a conservative homeomorphism whose set of ﬁxed points has
empty interior, and σ : EN → EN be such that dN(f , σ) < ε. Then there exists a conservative
−1satisﬁes
homeomorphism h such that d(h,Id) < ε and such that the homeomorphism g = hf h
gN = σ (and these properties remain true on a whole neighbourhood of h).
Proof of Proposition 5.56. Let δ = min{1/(2N), ε − d(h,Id)}. Let x1,··· , xqN be the points
of EN.
It may happen that some of these points are ﬁxed points of f , thus we de-
(cid:48)
qN) by induction, which is close
ﬁne an alternative sequence of points (x
to the sequence (x1, f (x1),··· , xqN , f (xqN)) and contains no ﬁxed points. Suppose that

σ(x(cid:96)) is ε− d(h,Id)-close to y
(cid:48)
(cid:96) and the point f (x(cid:96)) is d(h,Id)-close to σ(x(cid:96)), we can choose
−1, then by construction we have
h such that d(h,Id) < ε. Moreover, if we set g = hf h
(cid:48)
g(x(cid:96)) = h(f (x
(cid:96) is 1/(2N)-close to σ(x(cid:96)), we obtain gN(x(cid:96)) = σ(x(cid:96)) for all (cid:96).

As in this chapter, the only perturbation result we used was the proposition of ﬁnite

Corollary 5.57. All the results stated in this chapter concerning the dynamical behaviour
of the discretizations of generic conservative homeomorphisms remain true for the dynamical
behaviour of the discretizations of conservative homeomorphisms which are generic among
those conjugated to a given conservative homeomorphism whose set of ﬁxed points has empty
interior.

5.8 Numerical simulations

We now present the results of numerical simulations of conservative homeomor-
phisms. We are interested in whether it is possible to observe the behaviours described
by our theoretical results on actual simulations. It is not clear that the orders of dis-
cretization involved in these results can be reached in practice, or if simple examples
of homeomorphisms behave the same way as generic homeomorphisms. For instance,
can we observe a lot of discretizations that are cyclic permutations of the grid, or that
have a small degree of recurrence? Given a homeomorphism f , is it possible to see the
invariant measures of the discretizations accumulating on the set of invariant measures
of f ? Is it possible to recover the periodic points of the homeomorphism?
We simulate homeomorphisms f (x, y) = (Q◦ P)(x, y), where both P and Q are home-

omorphisms of the torus that modify only one coordinate:

so that P and Q both preserve Lebesgue measure. We discretize these examples accord-
ing to the uniform grids on the torus

.

We perform simulations of two conservative homeomorphisms which are small pertur-
bations of identity or of the standard Anosov automorphism A : (x, y) (cid:55)→ (x + y, x + 2y).

– To begin with we study f3 = Q◦ P, with

cos(2π× 775x),
sin(2π× 811y).

This conservative homeomorphism is a small C0 perturbation of identity. Expe-
rience shows that even dynamical systems with fairly simple deﬁnitions behave
quite chaotically (see for example [GT83]). We can expect that a homeomorphism
such as f3 has a complex dynamical behaviour and even more, behaves essen-
tially as a generic homeomorphism, at least for orders of discretization that can
be reached in practice. Note that we choose coeﬃcients that have (virtually) no
common divisors to avoid arithmetical phenomena such as periodicity or reso-
nance. Also, we have chosen to simulate a homeomorphism close to the identity
to avoid phenomenons like “every orbit of the discretization fN is ε-dense for all
N large enough”: in this case it would be diﬃcult to see something interesting in
the images of the invariant measures.

– We also simulate f4 the composition of f3 with the standard Anosov automor-

phism

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

,

say f4 = Q ◦ P ◦ A. This makes it a small C0-perturbation of A. Thus f4 is semi-
conjugated to A but not conjugated: to each periodic orbit of A corresponds many
periodic orbits of f4. As for f3, we deﬁne f4 in the hope that the behaviour of
its discretizations is fairly close to that of discretizations of a generic homeomor-
phism.

94

Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism

We have chosen to deﬁne the homeomorphisms we compute with lacunary trigono-

metric series, to “mimic” the action of Baire theorem.

Note that the homeomorphisms f3 and f4 have at least one ﬁxed point (for f3, simply
make simultaneously p(x) and q(y) vanish; for f4, note that 0 is a persistent ﬁxed point of
A). Theoretical results indicate that for a generic homeomorphism f which has a ﬁxed
point, inﬁnitely many discretizations has a unique ﬁxed point; moreover a subsequence
T2)N∈N tends to an invariant measure under f supported by a ﬁxed point; we can
of (µfN
test if these properties are true on simulations or not.

We refer to the page 61 for a presentation of the algorithm we used for the simula-

tions.

5.8.1 Combinatorial behaviour

As a ﬁrst step, we are interested in some quantities related to the combinatorial

behaviour of discretizations of homeomorphisms. These quantities are:

– the cardinality of the recurrent set Ω(fN);
– the number of periodic orbits of the map fN;
– the maximal size of a periodic orbit of fN.

qN

√

Recall that according to the theoretical results we obtained, for a generic homeomor-
phism, the degree of recurrence Card(Ω(fN))
should accumulate on the whole segment
[0,1] (Corollary 5.24), the number of orbits of fN should be 1 for some N and should
be bigger than (for example)
qN for other orders N (Corollaries 5.9 and 5.22) and the
maximal size of a periodic orbit of fN should be sometimes 1, and sometimes equal to
qN (Corollaries 5.9 and 5.22).

We have calculated these quantities for discretizations of orders 128k, for k from
1 to 150 and have represented them graphically (see Figure 5.7). For information, if
N = 128× 150, then qN (cid:39) 3.7× 108.

qN

We begin with the cardinality of the recurrent set Ω(fN) (Figure 5.7, top). Contrary
to what the theoretical results provide for a generic homeomorphism, for all simula-
tions, the degree of recurrence Card(Ω(fN))
tends clearly to 0 as N increases. More specif-
ically, the cardinality of Ω(fN) evolves much more regularly for f3 than for f4: for f3
the value of this cardinality seems to be the sum of a smooth increasing function and
a random noise, but for f4 this value seems to be the product of a smooth increasing
function with a random noise. We have no explanation for the parabolic shape of the
√
curve for f3: it reﬂects the fact that the cardinality of Ω((f3)N) evolves in the same way
√
N = 4
qN (whereas for a random map of a ﬁnite set with q elements into itself, it
as
q). Finally, it is interesting to note that for f4, the size of the recurrent set
evolves as
is distributed more or less around the size of the recurrent set of a random map of a set
with qN elements into itself, which depends (asymptotically) linearly of N (because it is
qN) and is worth about 24000 for N = 128× 150 (see [Bol01, XIV.5] or
of the order of
the Theorem 2.3.1 of [Mie05]).

√

√

√

According to the results of the previous sections, for a generic conservative homeo-
morphism f , the number of periodic orbits of fN should be sometimes equal to 1 and
qN. It is clearly not the case for these simula-
sometimes bigger than (for example)
tions. In addition, its behaviour is clearly not the same for f3 and for f4 (Figure 5.7,
middle): for f3 the number of orbits reaches quickly a value around 1.5×104 to stagnate
thereafter, while for f4 it oscillates between 1 and 16, regardless the order of discretiza-
tion. Note that contrary to what we have observed for the cardinality of the recurrent
set, this seem to contradict the fact that the discretizations of f4 behave like random

maps: if this were the case, the behaviour of this quantity should be proportional to
log N, with a value close to 25 for N = 128× 150. These graphics can be compared with
those representing the size of the recurrent set Ω((fi)N): the number of periodic orbits
and the size of the recurrent set are of the same order of magnitude for f3 (up to a fac-
tor 5), which means that the average period of a periodic orbit is small (which is not
surprising, since f3 is a small perturbation of identity). They diﬀer by a factor roughly
equal to 103 for f4, which means that this time the average period of a periodic orbit is
very large. This can be explained partly by the fact that the standard Anosov automor-
phism tends to mix what happens in the neighbourhood of identity. The fact remains
that these simulations (such as the size of the recurrent set Ω((fi)N)) suggest that the
behaviour in the neighbourhood of identity and of the standard Anosov automorphism

96

Chapter 5. Discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism

are quite diﬀerent, at least for reasonable orders of discretization.

Regarding the maximum size of a periodic orbit of fN (Figure 5.7, bottom), again its
behaviour does not correspond to that of a generic homeomorphism: it should oscillate
between 1 and qN, and this is not the case. However, it varies widely depending on N,
especially when N is large. The qualitative behaviours are quite similar for the three
simulations, but there are some quantitative diﬀerences: the maximum of the maximal
length of a periodic orbit is twice greater for f4 than for f3. For these simulations, there
is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the behaviours of the discretizations of f3: if we
remove the very big value that is attained by the maximal length of the periodic orbit
of f3 (for N close to 145), the graphics are very similar.

We have simulated the measure µ

for the two examples of conservative home-
omorphisms f3 and f4 as deﬁned page 93. Our purpose is to test whether phenomena
as described by Theorem 5.51 can be observed in practice or not. We obviously cannot
)N∈N accumulating on all the invariant probability mea-
expect to see the sequence (µ
sures of f , since these measures generally form an inﬁnite-dimensional convex set 14,
but we can still test if it seems to converge or not. In particular, we can try to detect
whether Lebesgue measure (which is the unique physical measure by Oxtoby-Ulam
theorem [OU41]) play a particular role for these invariant measures or not.
We present images of sizes 128 × 128 pixels representing in logarithmic scale the
density of the measures µfN
T2: each pixel is coloured according to the measure carried by
the set of points of EN it covers. Blue corresponds to a pixel with very small measure
and red to a pixel with very high measure. Scales on the right of each image corre-
sponds to the measure of one pixel on the log10 scale: if green corresponds to −3, then
a green pixel will have measure 10
T2. For information, when Lebesgue measure
is represented, all the pixels have a value about −4.2.

−3 for µfN

14. To see that, simply observe that the set of periodic points is a union of Cantor sets; the uniform

measures on these periodic orbits form an uncountable free family.

5.8. Numerical simulations

Firstly, we have computed the distance between the measure µfN

sure. The distance we have chosen is given by the formula

In practice, we have computed an approximation of this quantity by summing only on
the k ∈ (cid:126)0,7(cid:127). Theoretically, the distance between the measure µfN
T2 and Leb (Figure 5.8)
should oscillate asymptotically between 0 and the supremum over the set of f -invariant
measures µ of the distance between Lebesgue measure and µ. For f3 (left of Figure 5.8),
wee see that the distance between µfN
T2 and Leb seem to increase with N: the measure
µfN
X is close to Lebesgue measure for small values of N, and then is more and more far
away from Lebesgue measure. It can be explained by the fact that for a small N, the
discretization fN does not see the irregularities of f and is more or less close to the
discretization of identity. The behaviour for f4 is very diﬀerent: overall, the distance
between µfN
T2 and Leb is much smaller and decreasing, but we observe peaks of this
distance: there are a few values of N for which µfN

T2 is far away from Leb.

T2 and µfN+1
T2

The results of simulations of invariant measures of discretizations of f3 (which is a
C0 conservative perturbation of identity) are fairly positive: they agree with theoreti-
cal results about discretizations of generic conservative homeomorphisms, in particular
with Theorem 5.51. Indeed, when we compute discretizations of the homeomorphism
f3 on the grids of size 2k × 2k (Figure 5.9), we ﬁrst observe that µfN
T2 is fairly well dis-
tributed, say for 2k = 128,256,512. When the order of the discretization increases, we
can observe places where the measure accumulates; moreover these places changes a
lot when the order of discretization varies (see Figure 5.10): for the orders N we tested,
are always completely diﬀerent, and do not have anything
the measures µfN
in common with Lebesgue measure. This agrees fairly with what happens in the C0
generic case, where we have proved that the measure µfN
X depends very much on the
order of discretization, rather than on the homeomorphism itself. There is also an other
phenomenon: when the size of the grid is large enough (around 1012 × 1012), some
areas uniformly charged by the measure µfN
T2 appear; their sizes seem to be inversely
proportional to the common mass of the pixels of the area; we do not know why this
phenomenon appears. . .
For the discretizations of f4, which is a C0 conservative perturbation of the linear
Anosov automorphism A, the simulations on grids of size 2k × 2k might suggest that
the measures µ
tend to Lebesgue measure (Figure 5.11). In fact, making a large
number of simulations, we realize that there are also strong variations of the behaviour
of the measures (Figure 5.12): the measure is often well distributed in the torus, and
sometimes quite singular with respect to Lebesgue measure (as it can be seen in Figure
5.8). For example, when we discretize on the grid of size 22400× 22400 (middle right
of Figure 5.12), we observe an orbit of length 369 which mass 84% of the total mea-
sure.In fact the behaviour of discretizations looks the same that in the neighbourhood
of identity, modulo the fact that the linear Anosov automorphism A tends to spread the
attractive periodic orbits of the discretizations on the entire torus: for many values of

We represent the accumulation of the periodic points of period smaller than 5 of the

discretizations fN, for 1000 ≤ N ≤ 2000.

It can be easily seen that the periodic points of A are rational points; it is also easy
to compute by hand the coordinates of the periodic points of period smaller than 5. As
A is Anosov and as Anosov maps are structurally stable (see [KH95], Theorem 2.6.3
for the linear maps of the torus and Corollary 18.2.2 for the general case), a small C1
perturbation of A is (C0) conjugated to A: if dC1(A, g) is small enough, then there exists
a homeomorphism h ∈ Homeo(T2) which maps bijectively each set of periodic points
of a given period of A to the set of periodic points with the same period of g. If the
perturbation of A is only C0, then if dC0(A, g) is small enough but dC1(A, g) is big, then it
can happen that the homeomorphism g is only semi-conjugated to A. But for a generic

5.8. Numerical simulations

homeomorphism, the set of periodic points of a given period is either empty, either a
Cantor set with zero Hausdorﬀ dimension. Thus, to any periodic point of the linear
map A will correspond a Cantor set of periodic points of g (in other words, a generic
small C0 perturbation blows up each periodic point).

The theoretical results about discretizations assert that any periodic point of a
generic homeomorphism is shadowed by a periodic orbit with the same period of an in-
ﬁnite number of discretizations (see Theorem 5.36); the same result holds for a generic
C1-diﬀeomorphism (see Lemma 10.2). Thus, on the simulations, we should recover all
the periodic points of the initial map for both a small C1 and C0 generic perturbation.
On the left of Figure 5.13, we see that we recover all the periodic points of pe-
riod ≤ 5 of the linear Anosov map A. It is logical: these periodic points have rational
coordinates with small denominators, thus they are located on a lot of grids of order
N ∈ (cid:126)1000,2000(cid:127).
In the case of a small C1 perturbation g1 of A (middle of Figure 5.13), we also recover
all the periodic points of period ≤ 5 of the map: we can see that we detect one (and
almost always only one) periodic point of g1 in the neighbourhood of each periodic
point af A. In a certain sense, the simulation detects the conjugation between A and g1.
For the small C0 perturbation g2 of A (right of Figure 5.13), we observe the phe-
nomenon of blow up of the periodic points of A: to each periodic point of A corresponds
a lot of periodic points of the discretizations of g2. Thus, this simulation show two phe-
nomenon. Firstly, the fact that the set of periodic points of a generic homeomorphism is
a Cantor set is illustrated by some simple examples of homeomorphisms. Secondly, the
behaviour predicted by Theorem 5.36 can be observed on practice: we recover (all) the
periodic points of the homeomorphism with small period by looking at all the periodic
points of the discretizations on grids of reasonable orders.

How roundoff errors help to compute

the rotation set of torus

homeomorphisms

Introduction

We now present a practical application of the concept of discretization to the nu-

merical computation of rotation set of torus homeomorphisms.

In this chapter, to be able to talk about the rotation set of the homeomorphisms,
we will only consider homeomorphisms of the torus T2 which are homotopic to the
identity. In other words, the space phase will always be X = T2. We ﬁx once for all a
good measure λ on T2 (see Deﬁnition 3.1), and a sequence of grids EN on T2, which
is sometimes strongly self-similar (see Deﬁnition 3.13). As an example of such grids,
when λ = Leb, the reader can think about the canonical grids

(see Section 3.7 for other examples of grids).

We begin with the presentation of the concept of rotation set of a torus homeomor-

phism.

The concept of rotation number for circle homeomorphisms was introduced by H.
Poincaré in 1885.
In [Poi85], he states the theorem of classiﬁcation of orientation-
preserving circle homeomorphisms: if a homeomorphism has a rational rotation num-
ber, then it posses a periodic point and all its periodic points have the same period;
moreover the ω-limit set of every point is a periodic orbit (the dynamics is asymptoti-
cally periodic). On the contrary, if a homeomorphism has an irrational rotation number
α, then it is semi-conjugated to the rigid rotation of angle α (the dynamics contains that
of the irrational rotation). Ever since, the rotation number has been the fundamental
tool in the study of the dynamics of circle homeomorphisms (see for example [Her79]).
About a century after was introduced a generalisation to dimension 2 of this rotation
number, the rotation set for homeomorphisms of the torus which are homotopic to the
identity. Due to the loss of natural cyclic order on the phase space, there is no longer
a single speed of rotation for orbits; informally the rotation set is deﬁned as the set of
all possible rotation speeds of all possible orbits. Like in dimension 1, this topological
invariant gives precious informations about the dynamics of the homeomorphism; for

105

Chapter 6. How roundoﬀ errors help to compute the rotation set

example, depending of the shape of this set, we can ensure the existence of periodic
points of a given period ([Fra88], [Fra89]). Moreover, the size of this convex set gives
lower bounds on the topological entropy of the homeomorphism ([LM91] and [Kwa93]
for an explicit estimation). . . See the course [Bég07] of F. Béguin for a quite complete
survey of the results about the rotation sets.

The aim of this chapter is to tackle the question of numerical approximation of
the rotation set: given a homeomorphism of the torus homotopic to the identity, is it
possible to compute numerically its rotation set? In particular, is it possible to detect its
dimension? Is it possible to approximate it in Hausdorﬀ topology? And what algorithm
shall we use to compute it?

First of all, we build a theoretical model of what happens when we try to calculate
the rotation set of a homeomorphism with a computer. To do that, we ﬁrst take into
account the fact that the computer can calculate only a ﬁnite number of orbits; in par-
ticular it will detect only phenomenon that occur on λ-positive measure sets. This leads
us to the notion of observable rotation set: a rotation vector is called observable if it is
the rotation vector of an observable measure in the sense given by E. Catsigeras and H.
Enrich in [CE11]; more precisely, a measure µ is observable if for every ε > 0, the set of
points which have a Birkhoﬀ limit whose distance to µ is smaller than ε has λ-positive
measure (see Deﬁnition 6.4).

However, this notion of observable measure does not take into account the fact
that the computer uses ﬁnite precision numbers and can calculate only ﬁnite length
orbits; this observation leads to the deﬁnition leads to the deﬁnition of the asymptotic
discretized rotation set in the following way. We ﬁx a sequence of ﬁnite grids on the torus
with precision going to 0; the discretized rotation set on one of these grids is the collec-
tion of rotation vectors of periodic orbits of the discretization of the homeomorphism
on this grid (see section 6.1); the asymptotic discretized rotation set is then the upper
limit of these discretized rotation sets on the grids.

We focus mainly on the generic behaviour of both observable and asymptotic dis-
cretized rotation sets. We recall that a result of A. Passeggi states that for a generic
dissipative homeomorphism of the torus the rotation set is a polygon with rational ver-
tices, possibly degenerated 1 [Pas14]. In this chapter we will prove the following result
about generic dissipative homeomorphisms.

Theorem N. For a generic dissipative homeomorphism,
1. the observable rotation set is the closure of the set of rotation vectors corresponding to

Lyapunov stable periodic points (Lemma 6.16);

2. the convex hull of the observable rotation set, the convex hull of the asymptotic discretized

rotation set and the rotation set are equal;

3. if the rotation set has non-empty interior, there is no need to take convex hulls, i.e. both
observable and asymptotic discretized rotation sets coincide with the rotation set (Proposi-
tions 6.15 and 6.21).

Thus, it is possible to obtain the rotation set of a generic dissipative homeomorphism
from the observable or the asymptotic discretized rotation set. In other words, from
the theoretical point of view, it is possible to recover numerically the rotation set of a
generic homeomorphism. The generic conservative setting is quite diﬀerent.

1. Namely it can be a segment or a singleton. However there are open sets of homeomorphisms where

the rotation set has non-empty interior.

107

Theorem O. For a generic conservative homeomorphism,
1. the rotation set has non-empty interior (Proposition 6.2);
2. the observable rotation set consists in a single point: the mean rotation vector (Proposition
6.19). On the other hand, the asymptotic discretized rotation set coincides with the rotation
set (Corollary 6.23).

These results suggest the quite surprising moral that to recover the rotation set of a
conservative homeomorphisms, it is better to do coarse roundoﬀ errors at each iteration.
More precisely, if we compute a ﬁnite number of orbits with arbitrarily good precision
and long length, we will ﬁnd only the mean rotation vector of the homeomorphism;
but if we make roundoﬀ errors while computing, we will be able to retrieve the whole
rotation set.

We have performed numerical simulations to see whether these behaviours can be
observed in practice or not. To obtain numerically an approximation of the observable
rotation set, we have calculated rotation vectors of long segments of orbits for a lot
of starting points with high precision (these points being chosen randomly). For the
numerical approximation of the asymptotic discretized rotation set we have chosen a
ﬁne enough grid on the torus and have calculated the rotation vectors of periodic orbits
of the discretization of the homeomorphism on this grid.

We have chosen to make these simulations on some examples where the rotation set
is known to be the square [0,1]2. It makes us sure of the shape of the rotation set we
should obtain numerically, however it limits a bit the “genericity” of the examples we
can produce. We also produced simulations for a homeomorphism for which we do not
know the shape of the rotation set.

In the dissipative case, we made attractive the periodic points which realize the
vertex of the rotation set [0,1]2. It is obvious that these rotation vectors, which are
realized by attractive periodic points with basin of attraction of reasonable size, will
be detected by the simulations of both observable and asymptotic discretized rotation
sets; that is we observe in practice: we can recover quickly the rotation set in both cases
(Figures 6.1 and 6.2).

In the conservative setting, we observe the surprising behaviour predicted by the
theory: when we compute the rotation vectors of long segments of orbits we obtain
mainly rotation vectors which are quite close to the mean rotation vector, in particular
we do not recover the initial rotation set. More precisely, when we perform simula-
tions with three hours of calculation we only obtain rotation vectors close to the mean
rotation vector (Figure 6.7). On the other hand, when we calculate the union of the
discretized rotation sets over several grids to obtain a simulation of the asymptotic dis-
cretized rotation set, the rotation set is detected very quickly by the convex hulls of
discretized rotation sets (less than one minute of calculation) and when we compute
more orders of discretizations, we obtain a set which is quite close to [0,1]2 for Haus-
dorﬀ distance (Figure 6.9). Moreover, when we compute the observable rotation set of
a homeomorphism whose rotation set is unknown, we obtain a single rotation vector
(Figure 6.10); but when we simulate the asymptotic discretized rotation set, then we
obtain a sequence of “thick” sets whose convex hulls seem to converge (Figure 6.12). As
for theoretical results, this suggests the following lesson:
When we compute segments of orbits with very good precision it is very diﬃcult to recover
the rotation set. However, when we decrease the number of digits used in computations we
can obtain quickly a very good approximation of the rotation set.

108

Chapter 6. How roundoﬀ errors help to compute the rotation set

This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that each grid of the torus is stabi-
lized by the corresponding discretization of the homeomorphism. Thus, there exists
an inﬁnite number of grids such that every periodic point of the homeomorphism is
shadowed by some periodic orbits of the discretizations on these grids.

6.1 Notations and preliminaries

6.1.1 Rotation sets

The deﬁnition of the rotation set is made to mimic the rotation number for homeo-
morphisms of the circle. At ﬁrst sight the natural generalisation to dimension 2 of this
notion is the point rotation set, deﬁned as follows. For every homeomorphism f of the
torus T2 homotopic to the identity 2 we take a lift F : R2 → R2 of f to the universal cover
R2 of T2. The diﬀerence with the one dimensional case is that as we lose the existence
of a total order on our space, the sequence Fn( ˜x)− ˜x
no longer need to converge. Thus, we
have to consider all the possible limits of such sequences, called rotation vectors; the set
of rotation vectors associated to ˜x ∈ R2 will be denoted by ρ( ˜x):

n

(cid:41)
(cid:40) Fn( ˜x)− x
Then, the point rotation set is deﬁned as ρpts(F) =(cid:83)

˜x∈R2 ρ( ˜x). Unfortunately this
deﬁnition is not very convenient and it turns out that when we interchange the limits
in the previous deﬁnition, we obtain the rotation set

which has much better properties and is easier to manipulate. In particular, it is com-
pact and convex (see [MZ89]), and it is the convex hull of ρpts(F). Moreover, it coincides
with the measure rotation set: if we denote by D(F) the displacement function, deﬁned on
T2 by D(F)(x) = F( ˜x) − ˜x, where ˜x is a lift of x to R2 (we easily check that this quantity
does not depend of the lift), then (recall that M f is the set of f -invariant probability
measures)

(cid:40)(cid:90)

ρ(F) =

(cid:41)

D(F)(x) d µ | µ ∈ M f
(cid:90)

Finally, for a homeomorphism f preserving λ, we denote by ρmean(F) the mean rota-

tion vector of F:

ρmean(F) =

‘T2

D(F)(x) d λ(x).

The geometry of the rotation set of a generic dissipative homeomorphism is given

by a recent result published by A. Passeggi:
Theorem 6.1 (Passeggi, [Pas14]). On an open and dense set of homeomorphisms f ∈
Homeo(T2), the rotation set is locally constant around f and is equal to a rational polygon.

We end this paragraph by giving a proof that if f is a generic conservative homeo-

morphism of the torus, then ρ(F) has non-empty interior.

2. In this chapter every homeomorphism will be supposed homotopic to the identity.

6.1. Notations and preliminaries

109

Proposition 6.2. If f is generic 3 among Homeo(T2, λ), then ρ(F) has non-empty interior.

Remark 6.3. We do not know the shape of the boundary of the rotation set of a generic
conservative homeomorphism. In particular we do not know if it is a polygon or not.

Proof of Proposition 6.2. We use an argument due to S. Crovisier. If ρ(F) consists in a sin-
gle point, we use classical perturbation techniques for conservative homeomorphisms
to create a persistent periodic point x for f . Then, by composing by a small rotation of
the torus, we can move a little the mean rotation vector; in particular as the rotation
set still contains the rotation vector of the periodic point x, it is not reduced to a single
point. Now if the rotation set is a segment, by a C0 ergodic closing lemma we can create
a persistent periodic point whose rotation vector is close to the mean rotation vector in
the following way. A small perturbation allows us to suppose that the homeomorphism
we obtained, still denoted by f , is ergodic (it is the Oxtoby-Ulam theorem, see [OU41]).
We then choose a recurrent point y ∈ T2 which veriﬁes the conclusion of Birkhoﬀ’s the-
orem: for N large enough, the measure 1
k=0 δf k(y) is close to the measure λ. As this
N
point is recurrent, by making a little perturbation, we can make it periodic (like in the
proof of Lemma 5.46) and even persistent (see Deﬁnition 5.38 and Theorem 5.40 page
83); by construction ρ(y) is close to the mean rotation vector. We now have two persis-
tent periodic points, say x and y, whose rotation vectors are diﬀerent. It then suﬃces to
compose by an appropriate rotation such that the mean rotation vector goes outside of
the line generated by these two rotation vectors, and to repeat the construction to ﬁnd
a persistent periodic point whose rotation vector is close to this new mean rotation vec-
tor. Thus, we obtain a homeomorphism g which is arbitrarily close to f and possesses
three periodic points x, y and z whose rotation vectors are non-aligned; therefore the
rotation set of this homeomorphism has nonempty interior. Moreover, as the periodic
points x, y and z are persistent, this property remains true on a neighbourhood of g,
which concludes the proof for Homeo(T2,Leb).

6.1.2 Observable measures

From the ergodic point of view, we could be tempted to deﬁne the observable rota-
tion set to be the set of rotation vectors associated to physical measures (see Deﬁnition
3.9), which are deﬁned to express which measures can be observed in practice. How-
ever, such measures do not need to exist for every dynamical system, in this case the
associated observable rotation set would be empty. To solve this problem of non ex-
istence of physical measures, E. Catsigeras and H. Enrich have deﬁned in [CE11] the
weaker notion of observable measure:

Deﬁnition 6.4. A probability measure µ is observable for f if, for every ε > 0, the set

Aε(µ) = {x ∈ T2 | ∃ν ∈ pω(x) : dist(ν, µ) < ε}

(6.1)

has λ-positive measure (recall that pω(x) is the set of Birkhoﬀ limits of x, see page 45).
The set of observable measures is denoted by Obs(f ).

The interesting property of these measures is that, unlike physical measures, they
always exist. More precisely, the set Obs(f ) is a non-empty compact subset of the set of
invariant measures of f containing the set of physical measures (see [CE11]).

3. In fact on a open dense subset of Homeo(T2, λ).

µ is observable for hf h

Remark 6.5. The behaviour of observable measures is compatible with topological con-
jugacy in the following sense: if µ is observable for f and h is a homeomorphism which
∗
preserves null sets, then h
Example 6.6. 1. If f = Id, then Obs(f ) = {δx | x ∈ X}, but f has no physical measure.
2. If a dynamical system possesses a collection of physical measures whose basins of
attraction cover almost all the phase space X (for example if it is ergodic with respect
to a smooth measure), then the set of physical measures coincides with the set of
observable measures.

−1.

Proposition 6.7. If f is generic among Homeo(T2), then

Obs(f ) = Cl{δω | ω is a Lyapunov stable periodic orbit},

where Cl denotes the closure.

Thus, a generic homeomorphism f has a lot of observable measures 4, but no physi-

cal measure (it is a direct consequence of the shredding lemma 4.2, see [AA13]).
Proof of Proposition 6.7. The ﬁrst inclusion is easy: it suﬃces to remark that every stable
measure supported by a Lyapunov stable periodic orbit is observable.
For the other inclusion , let f be a generic dissipative homeomorphism, µ ∈ Obs(f )
and ε > 0. By hypothesis λ(Aε(µ)) > 0 (see Equation (6.1)), then ε
2 min(ε, λ(Aε(µ))) >
0. As f is generic, it satisﬁes the conclusions of the shredding lemma (see Section 4.1)
, in particular there exists a Borel set B ⊂ Aε(µ) and an open set
applied to f and ε
O ⊂ T2 such that:

= 1

(cid:48)

(cid:48)

– λ(B) > 0;
– O is strictly periodic: ∃i > 0 : f i(O) ⊂⊂ O;
– diam(O) < ε
– every orbit of every point of B belongs to O eventually.

,

(cid:48)

By Lemma 4.4 page 54, O contains a Lyapunov stable periodic point whose orbit is
denoted by ω; thus for every x ∈ B and every ν ∈ pω(x), we have dist(ν, δω) < ε
. But
by hypothesis dist(ν, µ) < ε, then dist(µ, δω) < 2ε, with ω a Lyapunov stable periodic
orbit.
Lemma 6.8. If f is generic among Homeo(T2, λ), then Obs(f ) = {λ} coincide with the set of
physical measures.

(cid:48)

Proof of Lemma 6.8. A classical theorem of J. Oxtoby and S. Ulam [OU41] states that
a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2, λ) is ergodic with respect to
the measure λ. But Remark 1.8 of [CE11] states that if the measure λ is ergodic, then
Obs(f ) = {λ}.

6.2 Observable rotation sets

6.2.1 Deﬁnitions

As said before, from the notion of observable measure, it is easy to deﬁne a notion of
observable ergodic rotation set. Another deﬁnition, more topologic, seemed reasonable
to us for observable rotation sets:

4. The set of Lyapunov stable periodic orbits is a Cantor set.

6.2.2 Properties of the observable rotation set

We begin by giving two lemmas which state the dynamical behaviour of the observ-

able rotation sets.
Lemma 6.11. For every q ∈ N, ρobs(Fq) = qρobs(F).
Proof of Lemma 6.11. It suﬃces to remark that ρFq(x) = qρF(x) (one inclusion is trivial
and the other is easily obtained by Euclidean division).

Lemma 6.13. If H is a homeomorphism of R2 commuting with integral translations and
preserving null sets, then ρobs(H◦ F◦ H

−1) = ρobs(F).

Proof of Lemma 6.13. It follows easily from the fact that the notion of observable mea-
sure is stable by conjugacy (see Remark 6.5).

We now give a few simple examples of calculation of observable rotation sets.

Example 6.14. 1. If f = Id, then ρobs(F) = {(0,0)}.
2. If

F(x, y) = (x + cos(2πy) , y) ,

then ρpts(F) = ρobs(F) = [−1,1]×{0}.

then ρpts(F) = {(0,−1),(0,1)}, but ρobs(F) = {(0,−1)} and ρobs(F

Then the rotation set of the (conservative) homeomorphism F = P ◦ Q is equal to
[0,1]2. Moreover, we can perturb F into a (conservative) homeomorphism ˜F such that
˜F is the identity on the neighbourhoods of the points whose coordinates belong to
1/2Z (applying for example Theorem 5.40). Then, the vertices of the square [0,1]2
belong to the observable rotation set of ˜F.

5. Let P be a convex polygon with rational vertices. In [Kwa92], J. Kwapisz has con-
structed an axiom A diﬀeomorphism f of T2 whose rotation set is the polygon P. It is
possible to modify slightly Kwapisz’s construction so that all the sinks of f are ﬁxed
points, and so that the union of the basins of these sinks have λ-full measure. Hence,
the observable rotation set of fP is reduced to {(0,0)}.

We now give the results about the link between the rotation set and the observable

rotation set in the generic setting. We begin by the dissipative case.

Proposition 6.15. If f is generic among Homeo(T2), then ρ(F) = conv(ρobs(F)). If moreover
f is generic with a non-empty interior rotation set, then ρ(F) = ρobs(F).

To prove this proposition, we will use the following lemma, which is a direct conse-

quence of Proposition 6.7.

Lemma 6.16. If f is generic among Homeo(T2), then

ρobs(F) = Cl{ρ( ˜x) | x is a Lyapunov stable periodic point}.

We will also need a theorem of realization of rotation vectors by periodic points.

Theorem 6.17 (J. Franks, [Fra89]). For every f ∈ Homeo(T2), every rational point of the
interior of ρ(F) is realized as the rotation vector of a periodic point of the homeomorphism f .

114

Chapter 6. How roundoﬀ errors help to compute the rotation set

Proof of Proposition 6.15. Theorem 6.1 states that for an open dense set of homeomor-
phisms, the rotation set is a rational polygon. Then, a theorem of realization of J. Franks
[Fra88, Theorem 3.5] implies that every vertex of this polygon is realized as the rotation
vector of a periodic point of the homeomorphism, which can be made attractive by a
little perturbation of the homeomorphism. Then generically we can ﬁnd a Lyapunov
stable periodic point which shadows the previous periodic point (by Lemma 4.4), in
particular it has the same rotation vector. Thus every vertex of ρ(F) belongs to ρobs(F)
and ρ(F) = conv(ρobs(F)).

For ε > 0, we can ﬁnd a ﬁnite ε-dense subset Rε of ρ(F) made of rational points.
Thus, Theorem 6.17 associates to each of these rational vectors a periodic point of the
homeomorphism which realizes this rotation vector; we can even make these periodic
points of the homeomorphism attractive. Thus, for every ε > 0, the set Oε made of the
homeomorphisms such that every vector of Rε is realized by a strictly periodic open
subset of T2 is open and dense in the set of homeomorphisms with non-empty interior
rotation set. Applying Lemma 4.4 we ﬁnd a Gδ dense subset of Oε on which every
strictly periodic open subset of T2 contains a Lyapunov stable periodic point; on this
set the Hausdorﬀ distance between ρ(F) = ρobs(F) is smaller than ε. The conclusion of
the proposition then easily follows from Baire theorem.

Remark 6.18. It is not true that ρ(F) = ρobs(F) holds for a generic homeomorphism: see
for instance the point 3 of Example 6.14, where on a neighbourhood of f the set ρobs is
contained in a neighbourhood of the points (0,−1) and (0,1).

For the conservative case, we recall the result of Proposition 6.2: the rotation set of
a generic conservative homeomorphism has non-empty interior. The following result
states that in this case the observable rotation set is much smaller, more precisely it
consists in a single vector, namely the mean rotation vector.
Proposition 6.19. If f is generic among Homeo(T2, λ), then ρobs(F) = {ρλ(F)}, where ρλ(F)
is the mean rotation vector with respect to the measure λ.
Thus, for almost every x ∈ T2 (with respect to the measure λ), the set ρ(x) is reduced

to a single point which is the mean rotation vector.

Proof of Proposition 6.19. It is easily implied by the fact that the measure λ is the only
observable measure (Lemma 6.8, which easily follows from Oxtoby-Ulam theorem).

6.3 Discretized rotation sets

will be the occasion to apply the techniques of proof explained in Chapter 5.

We now take into account the fact that the computer has a ﬁnite digital precision. It
The discretized rotation set is deﬁned as follows. Consider a lift F : R2 → R2 of f and

a lift ˜EN of the grid EN to R2. Then

Remark that this set coincides with the set of rotation vectors of the periodic orbits of
fN. Then the asymptotic discretized rotation set is the upper limit of the sets ρ(FN):

6.3. Discretized rotation sets

115

The ﬁrst result is that for every homeomorphism f , the discretized rotation set ρ(FN)
is almost included in the rotation set ρ(F) when N is large enough. This property fol-
lows easily with a compactness argument from the convergence of the sequence fN to
the homeomorphism f (for example for the Hausdorﬀ distance on the graphs of these
maps).
Proposition 6.20. For every homeomorphism f and every ε > 0, it exists N0 ∈ N such that
for every N ≥ N0, we have ρ(FN) ⊂ B(ρ(F), ε), where B(ρ(F), ε) denotes the set of points whose
distance to ρ(F) is smaller than ε. In particular ρdiscr(F) ⊂ ρ(F).
Proof of Proposition 6.20. By deﬁnition of the rotation set, for ε > 0 there exists m ∈ N
such that

| ˜x ∈ R2

⊂ B(ρ(F), ε).

Then there exists N0 ∈ N such that for every N ≥ N0,

This allows us to handle the case of long periodic orbits of the discretizations: by eu-

so in the 3ε-neighbourhood of the rotation set ρ(f ).
For short orbits we argue by contradiction: suppose that there exists ε > 0 such that
for every N0 ∈ N there exists N ≥ N0 and xN ∈ EN which is periodic under fN with
period smaller than m/ε and whose associated rotation vector is not in B(ρ(F), ε). Then
up to take subsequences these periodic points xN have the same period and converge to
a periodic point x ∈ T2 whose associated rotation vector (for F) is not in B(ρ(F), ε), which
is impossible.

The other inclusion depends on the properties of the map f . We begin by the dissi-

pative case.

It remains to prove that the lower limit of conv

contains ρ(F). To do that,
we prove that ρ(FN) converges to ρobs(F). First of all the rotation set is the closure of
the convex hull of the rotation vectors of Lyapunov stable periodic points (Propositions
6.7 and 6.15). To each one of these points we can associate a periodic closed set K
with non-empty interior and with period τ which has the same rotation vector. Then
there exists an open set O ⊂ K such that for N large enough and x ∈ K we also have
N(xN) ∈ O ⊂ K. Thus there exists i ∈ N∗

Chapter 6. How roundoﬀ errors help to compute the rotation set

For the conservative case, with the same techniques as in Chapter 5, we can prove

the following result:

Lemma 6.22. If f is generic among Homeo(T2, λ), then for every ﬁnite collection of rotation
vectors {v1,··· , vn}, each one realized by a periodic orbit of f , there exists a subsequence fNi
of discretizations such that for every i, ρNi (f ) = {v1,··· , vn}.
Proof of Lemma 6.22. We denote by Dq the set of subsets of Q2 made of elements whose
coordinates are of the type p

< q and −q2 < p

< q2. Consider the set

To prove the lemma it suﬃces to prove that this set contains a Gδ dense. This is obtained
with the same kind of proof as for Proposition 5.14.
Let f ∈ Homeo(T2, λ), ε > 0, q, N0 ∈ N and D ∈ Dq. We suppose that for all v ∈ D,
v is realizable by a persistent periodic orbit ωi of f . For all of these orbits ω1,··· , ω(cid:96),
we denote by pi the length of the orbit ωi and choose a point xi belonging to ωi. We
then apply Lax’s theorem (Theorem 5.5): if N is large enough, then there exists a cyclic
permutation σN of EN such that dN(f , σN) < ε. If N is large enough, then the families

N we obtain has then exactly (cid:96) periodic or-
bits, and each of them has the same rotation vector as the corresponding real periodic
orbit of f . As in the proof of Lemma 5.4, we then use the proposition of ﬁnite maps ex-
tension (Proposition 3.3) to build a homeomorphism g which is ε-close to f and whose
discretization gN satisﬁes ρ(GN) = D, and moreover we can suppose that this occurs on
a whole neighbourhood of g.

The combination of the realisation theorem of J. Franks [Fra89, Theorem 3.2] and
the fact that for a generic conservative homeomorphism the rotation set has non-empty
interior (Proposition 6.2) leads to the following corollary.

Corollary 6.23. If f is generic among Homeo(T2, λ), then for every compact subset K of the
rotation set of F there exists a subsequence fNi of discretizations such that ρNi (F) tends to K
for the Hausdorﬀ topology. In particular ρdiscr(F) = ρ(F).

6.4 Numerical simulations

We have conducted numerical simulations of the rotation sets associated to both dis-
sipative and conservative homeomorphisms. For the ﬁrst examples we treated, we have
made the deliberate choice to choose homeomorphisms whose rotation set is known to
be the square [0,1]2. Of course these homeomorphisms are not the best candidates for
“generic” homeomorphisms, but at least we are sure of what is the shape of the rotation
set we want to obtain.

6.4. Numerical simulations

117
As an example of dissipative homeomorphism we have taken f1 = R1 ◦ Q1 ◦ P1, and
for the conservative homeomorphism we have chosen the very similar expression g1 =
Q1 ◦ P1, where

(cid:17)(cid:19)
(cid:19)

(cid:17)

it can easily be seen that the rotation set of the homeomorphism ˜Q ◦ ˜P is the square
[0,1]2, whose vertices are realized by the points (0,0), (0,1/2), (1/2,0) and (1/2,1/2).
The perturbations P1 and Q1 of ˜P and ˜Q are small enough (in C2 topology) to ensure
that the rotation set remains the square [0,1]2; these perturbations are made in order
to make f1 “more generic” (in particular, the periodic orbits whose rotation vectors
realize the vertices of the square do not belong to the grids). The key property of the
homeomorphism R1 is that is has the ﬁxed points of f1 which realize the vertices of
[0,1]2 as ﬁxed attractive points; this creates ﬁxed attractive points which realize the
vertices of the rotation set.

We have chosen R1 to be very close to the identity in C1-topology to ensure that
the basins of the sinks and sources are large enough. Indeed, J.-M. Gambaudo and C.
Tresser have shown in [GT83] that, even for dissipative diﬀeomorphisms deﬁned by
very simple formulas, sinks and sources are often undetectable in practice because the
size of the their basins are too small.

We have conducted other series of simulations for two other examples of conserva-
tive homeomorphisms. The ﬁrst one has an expression which is very similar to that
of g1, but the cosines are replaced by a piecewise aﬃne map with the same following
properties: s is 1-periodic, s(0) = 1, s(1/2) = 0 and s is aﬃne between 0 and 1/2 and
between 1/2 and 1. More precisely, we set g2 = Q2 ◦ P2, with
(cid:19)

x , y + 2s(x + α) + 0.0234s(2(x + α))

P2(x, y) =

(cid:18)

+ 0.0167s(10(x + α)

;

x + 2s(y + β) + 0.0213s(2(y + β))

+ 0.0101s(6(y + β)) , y

.

(cid:19)

The properties of s imply that the rotation set of g2 is also the square [0,1]2; the
diﬀerence with g1 is that the vertices of this rotation set are no longer realized by elliptic
periodic points, which makes them harder to detect.

For the last conservative homeomorphism we tested, we made “random” choices of
the coeﬃcients; we do not know a priori what is its rotation set. More precisely, we took
g3 = Q3 ◦ P3, with

(cid:16)
(cid:16)

P3(x, y) =

Q3(x, y) =

+ 0.35sin(3π(y − 0.20159)) + 0.551256 , y

;

(cid:17)
(cid:17)

We will test on simulations whether the computed rotation sets seem to converge or
not. If so, it could be a good indication that the rotation set we obtained is close to the
actual rotation set.

1000

We have made two kinds of simulations of the rotation set.
– In the ﬁrst one we have computed the rotation vectors of segments of orbits of
length 1000 with good precision (52 binary digits); in other words for N random
starting points x ∈ T2, we have computed F1000(x)−x
. We have made these tests for
N = 100, which takes around 1s of calculation, N = 10000, which takes about
2min of calculation, and N = 1000000, which takes about 4h of calculation. This
is maybe the most simple process that can be used to ﬁnd numerically the rotation
set.
It should lead to a good approximation of the observable rotation set; in
particular, Proposition 6.15 suggests that, for the dissipative homeomorphism f1,
we should obtain a set which is close (for Hausdorﬀ distance) to the square [0,1]2,
and if not at least a set whose convex hull is this square. On the other hand, for
the conservative homeomorphisms gi, Proposition 6.19 suggests that we should
only obtain the mean rotation vector, which is close to (1/2,1/2).
– In the second kind of simulations we have computed the rotation vectors of the
periodic orbits of the discretization (fi)N on a grid N× N; these simulations calcu-
late the discretized rotation sets. For each homeomorphism we have represented
these sets for N = 499, N = 500 and N = 501, each calculation taking about 2s of
calculation. We have also computed the union of the discretized rotation sets for
100 ≤ N ≤ M, which represents the asymptotic discretized rotation set. We repre-
sent these sets for M = 100 ((cid:39) 0.5s of calculation), M = 150 ((cid:39) 15s of calculation),
M = 200 ((cid:39) 45s of calculation), M = 500 ((cid:39) 13min of calculation), M = 1000 ((cid:39)
1h 45min of calculation), M = 2000 ((cid:39) 14h of calculation) and for g3, M = 3950
((cid:39) 100h of calculation). The theory tells us that in both conservative and dissipa-
tive cases, for some N, the discretized rotation set should be close (for Hausdorﬀ
distance) to the square [0,1]2; a weaker property would be that its convex hull
should be close to this square. Moreover this should also be true for the asymp-
totic discretized rotation sets.

6.4. Numerical simulations

119

We shall notice that these two methods are formally the same: making simulations

on a grid N× N is equivalent to calculate with −log2 N binary digits (for example about
10 for N = 1000). The only diﬀerence is that for the second method we use deliberately
a very bad numerical precision, which allows us to detect the actual dynamics of the
discretizations.

Moreover, in practice, for a given calculation time, the calculation of the rotation set
by discretization (i.e. by the second method) allows to compute much more orbits than
the other method. More precisely, the algorithm we have used to compute the asymp-
totic discretized rotation set visits each point of the grid N × N once. Thus, for N2
starting points we only have to compute N2 images of the discretization of the homeo-
morphism on the grid; the number of rotation vectors we obtain is simply the number of
periodic orbits of the discretization. So in a certain sense this second algorithm is much
faster than the naive algorithm consisting in computing long segments of orbits. All the
simulations have been performed on a computer equipped with a processor Intel Core
I5 2.40GHz.

We shall notice that the calculated rotation sets we obtained for f1, g1 and g2 are
always contained inside of the square [0,1]2 (see the ﬁgures below). Indeed, the very
deﬁnition of the rotation set ensures that if T is large enough, then the rotation vector of
every segment of orbit of length T belongs to a neighbourhood of the rotation set; there-
fore the computed observable rotation set should be included in a small neighbourhood
of the rotation set provided we have chosen a large enough length of orbit. Concerning
the discretized rotation set, Proposition 6.20 ensures that if the order of discretization
is large enough, then the discretized rotation set is included in a neighbourhood of the
(cid:17)
actual rotation set. However, there is no global estimation of these integers, as can be
seen in the following example. Set f : T2 → T2 deﬁned by
x + α , y + sin(2πx)
,

f (x, y) =

(cid:16)

with α an irrational number close to (say) 1/(2T). As α ∈ R \ Q, we easily obtain that
(cid:104)
the rotation set of f is equal to (α,0); but if we compute the rotation numbers of all
the segment of orbit of length T, they will form a set which is close to the segment
(α,−2/π),(α,2/π)

(cid:105)

.

In the dissipative case, a lot of the obtained rotation vectors are close to one of the
vertices of the real rotation set [0,1]2 of f1, the others being located around (1/2,1/2)
(see Figure 6.1). This is what is predicted by the theory, in particular by Lemma 6.16:
we detect rotation vectors realized by Lyapunov stable periodic points. The fact that
the rotation vectors are not located exactly on the vertices of [0,1]2 can be explained
by the slow convergence of the orbits to the attractive points: it may take a while un-
til the orbit become close to one of the Lyapunov stable periodic points. We will see
that this behaviour is very diﬀerent from the one in the conservative case, even if the
homeomorphism f1 is very close to g1 (approximately 10

For the discretized rotation set for f1, the vertices of [0,1]2 are also detected, and
we only have a few points in the interior of the square (see Figure 6.2). However, when
we compute the asymptotic discretized rotation set (see Figure 6.3), we observe that the
computed rotation vectors ﬁll a great proportion of the square [0,1]2, as predicted by
the theory.

−2 close).

In the conservative case, the rotation vectors of the observable rotation set are
mainly quite close to the mean rotation vector of g1, as predicted by Proposition 6.19.

120

Chapter 6. How roundoﬀ errors help to compute the rotation set

In particular in Figure 6.4, left, all the 100 rotation vectors of the computed observable
rotation set are in the neighbourhood of (1/2,1/2). Thus, the behaviour of these vec-
tors is governed by Birkhoﬀ’s ergodic theorem with respect to the ergodic measure Leb;
a priori this behaviour is quite chaotic and converges slowly: a typical orbit will visit
every measurable subset with a frequency proportional to the measure of this set, so
the rotation vectors will take time to converge. When the number of computed orbits
increases (Figure 6.4, middle and rignt), we observe that a few rotation vectors are not
close to the mean rotation vector; for 106 diﬀerent orbits we even detect three of the
vertices of the actual rotation set. Anyway, even after 4 hours of calculation, we are
unable to recover completely the initial rotation set of the homeomorphism.
On the other hand, the convex hull of the discretized rotation set gives quickly a
very good approximation of the rotation set. For example on a grid 500 × 500 (Figure
6.5), with 2s of calculation (and even on a grid 100 × 100 and 0.2s of calculation), we
obtain a rotation set whose convex hull is already very close to [0,1]2. However, for
a single size of grid, we do not obtain exactly the conclusions of Corollary 6.23 which
states that for some integers N the discretized rotation set should be close to the rotation
set for Hausdorﬀ distance; here for each N we only have a few points in the interior of
[0,1]2. That is why we represented the union of the discretized rotation sets on grids
N × N with 100 ≤ N ≤ 1000 (Figure 6.6). In this case we recover almost all the rotation
set of g1, except from the points which are close to one edge of the square but far from
its vertices. The fact that we can obtain very easily the vertices of the rotation set can
be due to the fact that in our example f1 these vertices are realized by elliptic periodic
points of the homeomorphism (in fact the derivative on this points is the identity). That
is why we also conducted simulations of the homeomorphism g2 which rotation set is
also the square [0,1]2 whose vertices are realized by non-elliptic periodic points.

In fact, when we compute the observable rotation set for g2 (Figure 6.7), we only ﬁnd
rotation vectors which are close to the mean rotation vector, even after 4h of calculation.
As the periodic points which realize the vertices of the rotation set are no longer elliptic,
they are much more unstable and thus they are not detected by these simulations.

The sets detected by the discretized rotation sets of order 499, 500 and 501 (Figure
6.8) are quite bigger than those detected by the simulations of the observable rotation
set, even if the time of calculation is much smaller. However, we do not recover the
whole rotation set of the homeomorphism (we conducted simulations for higher orders
around N = 1000 and N = 2000 and the behaviour is similar). By contrast, the simula-
tions of the asymptotic discretized rotation set (Figure 6.9) allows us to see the actual
rotation set of the homeomorphism: when we represent all the rotation vectors of the
discretizations of order 100 ≤ N ≤ M with M = 200 (which takes about 45s of calcula-
tion) we obtain a set which is very close to the square [0,1]2; for M = 100 ((cid:39) 1h 45min
of calculation) we recover almost exactly the initial rotation set.

Finally, the behaviour of the observable rotation set of g3 is very similar to that of
g2 (see Figure 6.10): even when we compute 1000000 diﬀerent orbits with random
starting points, we only obtain rotation vectors which are close to (0.55,0.5), which
should be a good approximation of the mean rotation vector.
Like for g2, the simulations of the discretized rotation sets for the grids EN with N ∈
{499,500,501} (Figure 6.11) are not very convincing: the sets do not seem to converge to
anything. We have to compute the asymptotic discretized rotation sets (Figure 6.11) to
see something that looks like a convergence for the Hausdorﬀ topology of the computed
rotation sets. However, this convergence in practical is just an indication that the set we

compute is close to the actual rotation set of g3. To our knowledge, it is impossible to
ensure that for a given order of discretization, the asymptotic rotation set computed to
this order is close to the rotation set of g3.

In the second part of this manuscript, we will consider the dynamical behaviour
of the discretizations of linear maps. We were led to this question by the study of the
dynamics of the discretizations of generic C1-diﬀeomorphisms; for exmaple, we will see
in the next part that the study of the degree of recurrence of a generic conservative C1-
diﬀeomorphism requires a good understanding of the dynamics of the discretizations
of linear maps. However, it seemed to us that the study of the linear case could form a
whole part. Indeed, it appeared that this subject is itself quite interesting and does not
use the tools developed in the other parts of this manuscript. Moreover, the techniques
involved in this second part of the thesis are very diﬀerent from that used in the oth-
ers: we will use tools like almost periodic patterns, model sets or lattice tilings of the
Euclidean space by unit cubes.

The deﬁnition of the discretization of a linear map of Rn (n ≥ 2) is made to mimic
that of the discretization of a map of a compact space. The idea underlying this def-
N Zn ∩ [−1,1]n for a large N, and to consider the images of
inition is to take the grid 1
this grid by the discretization of linear maps on the grid 1
N Zn. As the action of a linear
map is invariant under homothety, it is equivalent to look at the grids Zn∩[−N, N]n and
to consider the images of these grids by the discretization of linear maps on the grid
Zn. Thus, we deﬁne a projection π of Rn onto Zn, which maps any point of Rn onto
(one of) the closest point of the lattice Zn (see Deﬁnition 7.11); given A ∈ GLn(R), the
discretization of A is the map
sequence ((cid:99)Ak)k≥1, and in particular, the density of the set Γk = ((cid:99)Ak ◦ ··· ◦(cid:99)A1)(Zn). This

First of all, we study the structure of the image sets Γk. It appears that there is a kind
of “regularity at inﬁnity” of the behaviour of Γk. More precisely, this set is an almost
periodic pattern: for every ε > 0 there exists a relatively dense 5 set of ε-translations of Γk,
Roughly speaking, for R large enough, the set Γk ∩ BR determines the whole set Γk up to
an error of density smaller than ε. We prove that the image of an almost periodic pattern
by the discretization of a linear map is still an almost periodic pattern (Theorem 7.12);

thus, given a sequence (Ak)k≥1 of invertible matrices, the sets ((cid:99)Ak◦···◦(cid:99)A1)(Zn) are almost

periodic patterns. In particular, these sets possess a uniform density: the superior limit
in Equation (6.2) is in fact a limit (Corollary 7.7). This allows us to deﬁne the rate of
injectivity: given a sequence (Ak)k≥1 of linear maps, the rate of injectivity in time k of
this sequence is the quantity (see Deﬁnition 7.19)

where BR = B∞(0, R). As these quantities are decreasing in k, we can also deﬁne the

These rates on injectivity can be seen as the quantity of information we lose when we
apply a sequence of discretizations of matrices.

The link between the rate of injectivity and the density of the images sets is made

by the following formula (Proposition 7.20):

τk(A1,··· , Ak) = det(A1)···det(Ak)D+(cid:16)

((cid:99)Ak ◦···◦(cid:99)A1)(Zn)

.

The goal of the second chapter of this part is to study the behaviour of the asymp-
totic rate of injectivity of a generic sequence of matrices of SLn(R) (in fact, the same
holds for matrices with determinant ±1). It is given by the main theorem of this chapter
(Theorem 8.24).

Theorem P. For a generic sequence (Ak)k≥1 of matrices of SLn(R), we have τ

If this result can seem quite natural, its proof is far from being trivial. First of all,

the sets Γk = ((cid:99)Ak ◦ ···(cid:99)A1)(Zn) are “more and more complex” when k increases: a priori,
the radius R0 for which Γk ∩ BR0 determines almost all Γk is more and more large when
k increases; it is very diﬃcult to have an idea of the local geometry of these sets, thus
to decide which is the best possible perturbation of the matrices (especially since we
have to get practical estimates on the loss of injectivity). Moreover, once the set Γk has a
density smaller than 1/2, it may be impossible to make the rate decrease in one step of
time. For example, if we set

= 0.

then
τ2(A1, A2) = 1/4. In such cases, it seems diﬃcult to have a long term strategy to make
the rate decrease. . .

The idea of the proof of Theorem P is to take advantage of the fact that for a generic
sequence of matrices, the coeﬃcients of all the matrices are rationally independent (in
remark that the local pattern of the image set(cid:98)A(Zn) around(cid:98)A(x) is only determined by
fact, we will only need a weaker assumption about he independence). For example, for
a generic matrix A ∈ SLn(R), the set A(Zn) is uniformly distributed modulo Zn. We then

As a ﬁrst application of this remark, we state that the rate of injectivity in time 1
can be seen as the area of an intersection of cubes (Proposition 8.11). This observation,
(Γk−v)∩Γk
combined with considerations about the frequency of diﬀerences ρΓk(v) = D
,
allows to prove a weak version of Theorem P: the asymptotic rate of injectivity of a
generic sequence of matrices of SLn(R) is smaller than 1/2 (Theorem 8.30). It also leads
to a proof of the following result.
Theorem Q. Let (Pk)k≥1 be a generic sequence of matrices of On(R). Then τ

In particular, for a generic sequence of rotations of the plane, we have a total loss
of information when we apply successively the discretizations of these rotations (see
Figure 6.17).
At the end of the second chapter of this part, we make a full use of the equidistri-
bution property to see the rate of a sequence A1,··· , Ak of matrices of SLn(R) in terms
of areas of intersections of cubes in Rnk (Proposition 8.40). The proof of this formula
is based on the notion of model set 6 (Deﬁnition 7.32), which is a particular class of
almost periodic patterns. Using this formula, we replace the iteration by a passage
in high dimension. These considerations allow to prove Theorem P, without having
to make “clever” perturbations of the sequence of matrices (that is, the perturbations
made a each iteration are chosen independently from that made in the past or in the
future).

Finally, the last chapter of this part is devoted to the study of the statistics of the
roundoﬀ errors induced by the discretization process. The main result is the following
(Proposition 9.1).
Proposition R. For a generic sequence (Ak)k≥1 of matrices of GLn(R), or SLn(R), or On(R),
for every ﬁxed integer k, the ﬁnite sequence of errors εx =

This chapter presents a work in progress; the goal of these considerations is to study
in more depth a conjecture of O.E. Lanford (Conjecture 12.13) concerning the physical
measures of expanding maps of the circle.

Throughout this part, we will use several notions of almost periodicity: Delone sets,
almost periodic patterns, weakly almost periodic sets (which is, to our knowledge, an
original concept), model sets, Bohr and Besicovitch almost periodic functions. We now
give a quick overview of the history of these diﬀerent concepts. The history of almost
periodic sets is made of many independent rediscoveries, made in diﬀerent areas of
mathematics and physics. The ﬁrst traces of studies of some notions of almost peri-
odicity date back to 1893 with the master’s thesis of P. Bohl “Über die Darstellung von
Funktionen einer Variabeln durch trigonometrische Reihen mit mehreren einer Variabeln pro-
portionalen Argumenten”, where the author introduces quasi-periodic functions. This
class of functions were rediscovered about ten years later by E. Esclangon, in the view
of the study of celestial mechanic. Almost periodic functions have been studied in more
depth by H. Bohr in 1924. In the paper [Boh24], he proves in particular the fundamen-
tal theorem stating that any uniform almost periodic function (now called Bohr almost

periodic function) is the limit of generalized trigonometric series (and reciprocally).
Two years later, A. Besicovitch deﬁned a weaker notion of almost periodicity [Bes26];
the results of these papers were summarized later in the books [Boh47] and [Bes55]. In
the early seventies, Y. Meyer [Mey72] introduced model sets in the context of harmonic
analysis (more precisely, he wanted to study Pisot and Salem numbers). These sets
were rediscovered independently in 1981 by N. G. de Bruijn (see [dB81]) to study Pen-
rose aperiodic tilings. These aperiodic tilings we introduced in 1974 by the physicist R.
Penrose [Pen74] (see Figure 6.14), inspired by the work of J. Kepler (see Figure 6.13). In
1984 was made the fundamental discovery of quasicrystals [SBGC84] (see Figure 6.15),
that is, solids that are ordered but not periodic. Quickly, the link was made with the
previous works of H. Bohr and A. Besicovitch. Since then, the various notions of almost
periodicity play an important role in the study of quasicrystals and aperiodic tilings,
but also in many other parts of mathematics (see for example the survey [Moo00]). Var-
ious mathematical formulations of quasicrystals have been proposed, such as Meyer sets
(see [Mey95]), and the harmonic study of these sets has been investigated (see [Mey12]).
Quite recently, P. Lu, an American physicist, discovered that some very old Uzbek mo-
saics have the same structure than the Penrose tiling (see Figure 6.16). It is amusing to
note that in our case, the study of almost periodic sets arises from a branch of math-
ematics which is still diﬀerent: the discretizations of generic diﬀeomorphisms of the
torus.

The particular problem of the discretization of linear maps has been only little stud-
ied. To our knowledge, what has been made in this direction has been initiated by image
processing. The goal of these studies is to try to answer to the question: what is the best

way to deﬁne the action of a linear map on the lattice Z2? In particular, how can we
compute the image of a numerical image by a linear map? More precisely, we want to
avoid phenomenons like loss of information (due to the fact that discretizations of lin-
ear maps are not injective) or aliasing (the apparition of undesirable periodic patterns
in the image, due for example to a resonance between a periodic pattern in the image
and the discretized map). For example, in Figure 6.17, we have applied 40 successive
random rotations to a 500× 684 pixels picture, using a consumer software. These dis-
cretized rotations induce a very strong blur in the resulting image, thus a big loss of
information. To our knowledge, the existing studies are mostly interested in the linear
maps with rational coeﬃcients (see for example [Jac95], [Neh96] or [JDC01]), and also in
the speciﬁc case of rotations (see for example [And96], [Nou06], [Thi10], [BV00]). These
works mainly focus on the local behaviour of the images of Z2 by discretizations of lin-
ear maps: given a radius R, what pattern can follow the intersection of this set with any
ball of radius R? What is the number of such patterns, what are their frequencies? Are
they complex (in a sense to deﬁne) or not? Are these maps bijections? In particular, the
thesis [Nou06] of B. Nouvel gives a characterization of the angles for which the discrete
rotation is a bijection (such angles are countable and accumulate only on 0).

Here, our point of view is quite diﬀerent: we want to determine the dynamical
behaviour of discretizations of generic linear maps; in particular generic matrices are
totally irrational (by this, we mean that the image of the lattice Zn by the matrix is
equidistributed modulo Zn). We will see that the behaviour of discretizations of generic
linear maps is in a certain sense smoother than that of rational linear maps: for ex-
ample the rate of injectivity is continuous when restricted to totally irrational matrices
(Proposition 8.4), while it is not on some rational matrices (Proposition 8.1). However,
we study the rate of injectivity of a sequence of matrices, which measures the loss of
information we have when we apply several discretized linear maps to an image; The-

orem P expresses that in the general case, when we apply a lot of linear maps, then we
lose most of the information contained in the image, and Theorem Q states that this
phenomenon also appears for a generic sequence of rotations.

Chapter 7

Almost periodic sets

In this chapter, we introduce the basic notions that we will use during the study of
discretizations of linear maps of Rn, n ≥ 1. First of all, we introduce the notion of almost
periodic pattern: roughly speaking, a set Γ ⊂ Zn is an almost periodic pattern if for R
large enough, the set Γ ∩ [−R, R]n determines the whole set Γ up to an error of density
smaller than ε (see Deﬁnition 7.3). It can be easily seen that an almost periodic pattern
Γ possesses a uniform density, that is, that the limit

D(Γ ) = lim
R→+∞

Card(Γ ∩ [−R, R]n)
Card(Zn ∩ [−R, R]n)

(cid:17)

is well deﬁned (Corollary 7.7).

Recall that the discretization of a linear map A ∈ GLn(R) is the map(cid:98)A = π ◦ A : Zn →

(cid:16)
(Γ −v)∩Γ

Zn, where π is a projection from Rn to the nearest element of Zn (see Deﬁnition 7.11).
The deﬁnition of an almost periodic pattern is supported by Theorem 7.12, which states
that the image of an almost periodic pattern by the discretization of a linear map is still
an almost periodic pattern. In particular, the successive images of the integer lattice
Zn by the discretizations of linear maps are almost periodic patterns, and possess a
uniform density.

We then study the frequency of any diﬀerence v in the almost periodic pattern Γ , de-
ﬁned by ρΓ (v) = D
(Deﬁnition 7.24); in particular we prove a Minkowski-like
theorem for these diﬀerences (Theorem 7.29, obtained in collaboration with É. Joly): if
S is a centrally symmetric convex body, then the sum of the frequency of the diﬀerences
v ∈ S is bigger than a quantity which depends linearly on the measure of S.
Finally, we introduce the notion of model set (Deﬁnition 7.32): the model set mod-
elled on a lattice Λ of Rm+n and on a “regular” set W ⊂ Rm is the projection on the n last
We state that the images sets ((cid:99)Ak ◦···◦(cid:99)A1)(Zn) are model sets, and prove that these sets

are almost periodic patterns (Theorem 7.36, obtained in collaboration with Y. Meyer).
We ﬁx once for all an integer n ≥ 1. We will denote by (cid:126)a, b(cid:127) the integer segment
[a, b] ∩ Z. In this part, every ball will be taken with respect to the inﬁnite norm; in
particular, for x = (x1,··· , xn), we will have

We will also denote BR = B(0, R). Finally, we will denote by (cid:98)x(cid:99) the biggest integer that
is smaller than x and (cid:100)x(cid:101) the smallest integer that is bigger than x. For a set B ⊂ Rn, we
will denote [B] = B∩ Zn.

7.1 Almost periodic patterns: deﬁnitions and ﬁrst properties

In this section, we deﬁne the notion of almost periodic pattern and prove that these

sets possess a uniform density.

Deﬁnition 7.1. Let Γ be a subset of Rn.

– We say that Γ is relatively dense if there exists RΓ > 0 such that each ball with radius

at least RΓ contains at least one point of Γ .

– We say that Γ is a uniformly discrete if there exists rΓ > 0 such that each ball with

radius at most rΓ contains at most one point of Γ .

The set Γ is called a Delone set if it is both relatively dense and uniformly discrete.
Deﬁnition 7.2. For a discrete set Γ ⊂ Rn and R ≥ 1, we deﬁne the uniform R-density:

satisﬁes:

(2RΓ + 1)n

≤ D+(Γ ) ≤

(2rΓ + 1)n .

We can now deﬁne the notion of almost periodic pattern that we will use throughout
this chapter. Roughly speaking, an almost periodic pattern Γ is a set for which there
exists a relatively dense set of translations of Γ , where a vector v is a translation of Γ if
Γ − v is equal to Γ up to a set of upper density smaller than ε. More precisely, we state
the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 7.3. A Delone set Γ is an almost periodic pattern if for every ε > 0, there exists
Rε > 0 and a relatively dense set Nε, called the set of ε-translations of Γ , such that

∀R ≥ Rε, ∀v ∈ Nε, D+

< ε.

(cid:17)

Remark that if Γ is a subset of Zn with positive upper density and which satisﬁes the
condition of this deﬁnition, then it is a Delone set. In the sequel, we will only use this
deﬁnition for subsets of the lattice Zn. Remark that by [Fav12, Theorem 3], an almost
periodic pattern which is also a Meyer set 1 is “almost included” in a ﬁnite union of
lattices.

Of course, every lattice, or every ﬁnite union of translates of a given lattice, is an
almost periodic pattern. We will see in next section a large class of examples of almost
periodic patterns: images of Zn by discretizations of linear maps.

This deﬁnition is stronger than the following one, that we initially used for this

study.

Deﬁnition 7.4. We say that a Delone set Γ is weakly almost periodic if for every ε > 0,
there exists R > 0 such that for every x, y ∈ Rn, there exists v ∈ Rn such that

Remark that a priori, the vector v is diﬀerent from y − x.

We had deﬁned this concept because it seemed to us that it was the weakest to imply
the existence of a uniform density. Unfortunately, this notion is not very convenient to
manipulate and we have not succeeded to prove that it is stable under the action of
discretization of linear maps. Of course, we have the following result (see also the
addendum [GM14] of [Mey12] for more details on the subject).

Proposition 7.5. Every almost periodic pattern is weakly almost periodic.

We do not know if the converse is true or not (that is, if there exists weakly almost

periodic sets that are not almost periodic patterns).

Proof of Proposition 7.5. We prove that an almost periodic pattern satisﬁes Equation
(7.2) for x = 0, the general case being obtained by applying this result twice.

Let Γ be an almost periodic pattern and ε > 0. Then by deﬁnition, there exists Rε > 0

and a relatively dense set Nε (for a parameter RNε > 0) such that

Moreover, as Γ is Delone, there exists rΓ > 0 such that each ball with radius smaller than
rΓ contains at most one point of Γ .
As Nε is relatively dense, for every y ∈ Rn, there exists vy ∈ −Nε such that d∞(y, vy) <
RNε. This vy is the vector v we look for to have the property of Deﬁnition 7.4. Indeed,
by triangle inequality, for every R ≥ Rε, we have

Weakly almost periodic sets – and in particular almost-periodic patterns – have a

regular enough behaviour at the inﬁnity to possess a density.

Proposition 7.6. Let Γ be a weakly almost periodic set. Then the uniform upper density of Γ
is a limit, more precisely:

Moreover, we have uniformity of the convergence of the density with respect to the base point,
that is: for every x ∈ Rn, we have

limit; in other words Γ possesses a uniform density.

7.2 Almost periodic patterns and linear maps

In this section, we prove that the notion of almost periodic pattern is invariant under
discretizations of linear maps: the image of an almost periodic pattern by the discretiza-
tion of a linear map is still an almost periodic pattern. First of all, we deﬁne precisely
what we mean by discretization of a linear map.

The main result of this section is the following theorem.

Theorem 7.12. Let Γ ⊂ Zn be an almost periodic pattern and A ∈ GLn(R). Then the set(cid:98)A(Γ )
images ((cid:99)Ak ◦···◦(cid:99)A1)(Zn) are almost periodic patterns. See Figure 7.2 for an example of
the successive images of Z2 by a random sequence of bounded matrices of SL2(R).
Notation 7.13. For A ∈ GLn(R), we denote A = (ai,j)i,j. We denote by IQ(A) the set of
indices i such that ai,j ∈ Q for every j ∈ (cid:126)1, n(cid:127)

In particular, for every lattice Λ of Rn, the set π(Λ) is an almost periodic pattern.

contrary, in the irrational case, the image A(Zn) is equidistributed modulo Zn: on every
large enough domain, the density does not move a lot when we perturb the image set
A(Zn) by small translations. This reasoning is formalized by Lemmas 7.15 and 7.16.

Remark 7.17. In Section 8.1 of Chapter 8, we will present an example which shows that
the assumption “for every i ∈ IQ(A), vi = 0” is necessary to obtain the conclusion of the
lemma.
Remark 7.18. When IQ(A) = ∅, and in particular when A is totally irrational (see Deﬁni-
tion 8.3), the map v (cid:55)→ τ(A + v) is continuous in 0; the same proof as that of this lemma
implies that this function is globally continuous.

We begin by the proofs of both lemmas, and prove Theorem 7.12 thereafter.

Proof of Lemma 7.15. Let us begin by giving the main ideas of the proof of this lemma.
For R0 large enough, the set of remainders modulo Zn of vectors Av, where v is a ε-
translation of Γ belonging to BR0, is close to the set of remainders modulo Zn of vectors
Av, where v is any ε-translation of Γ . Moreover (by the pigeonhole principle), there
exists an integer k0 such that for each ε-translation v ∈ BR0, there exists k ≤ k0 such
that A(kv) is close to Zn. Thus, for every ε-translation v of Γ , there exists a (k0 − 1)ε-
) is close to Zn. The vector
translation v

= (k − 1)v, belonging to Bk0R0, such that A(v + v

is then a k0ε-translation of Γ (by additivity of the translations) whose distance to

We now formalize these remarks. Let Γ be an almost periodic pattern, ε > 0 and
A ∈ GLn(R). First of all, we apply the pigeonhole principle. We partition the torus
Rn/Zn into squares whose sides are smaller than δ; we can suppose that there are at
most (cid:100)1/δ(cid:101)n such squares. For v ∈ Rn, we consider the family of vectors {A(kv)}0≤k≤(cid:100)1/δ(cid:101)n
modulo Zn. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these vectors, say A(k1v) and
A(k2v), with k1 < k2, lie in the same small square of Rn/Zn. Thus, if we set kv = k2 − k1
and (cid:96) = (cid:100)1/δ(cid:101)n, we have

possible by Remark 7.10).

Theorem 7.12 motivates the following deﬁnition.

and for an inﬁnite sequence (Ak)k≥1 of invertible matrices, as the previous quantity is
decreasing, we can deﬁne the asymptotic rate of injectivity

= lim

k→+∞ τk(A1,··· , Ak) ∈ [0,1].

An easy calculation shows that the rate of injectivity can be deduced from the uni-

form density of the image(cid:98)A(Zn) (in particular, it uses the fact that for every A ∈ GLn(R)

and every R > 0, the set A(BR) is Jordan-measurable, see Remark 7.8).

experimentally not exponential. Also note that contrary to what happens in the case of
isometries (see Figure 8.14), some hyperbolic-like phenomenons can occur in a random

The same convergence holds for every aﬃne map, thus we will also use the notion

of rate of injectivity (and the notation τ) in this more general context.
The quantity τ(A) does not change when we multiply A on his right by an element of
SLn(Z). Similarly, τk(A1,··· , Ak) in invariant under the multiplication of A1 on his right
by an element of SL2(Z). It is diﬃcult to detect more simple invariants for the rate τ
(or even τk), for example it has no obvious good behaviour with respect to the geodesic
ﬂow (or horocyclic ﬂow) on the modular surface SL2(R)/SL2(Z) (see Figure 8.4)

The goal of Chapter 8 will be to study in detail this quantity τ, and in particular to
prove that the behaviour of the rate suggested by Figure 7.3 actually holds, namely that
the asymptotic rate of injectivity of a generic sequence of SLn(R) is zero (Theorem 8.24).

We end this section by a technical lemma that we will use a lot in next chapter. It
expresses that given an almost periodic pattern Γ , a generic matrix A ∈ GLn(R) is non
resonant with respect to Γ .

Lemma 7.21. Let Γ ⊂ Zn be an almost periodic pattern with positive uniform density. Then
the set of A ∈ GLn(R) (respectively SLn(R), On(R)) such that A(Γ ) is equidistributed modulo
Zn is generic. More precisely, for every ε > 0, there exists an open and dense set of A ∈ GLn(R)
(respectively SLn(R), On(R)) such that there exists R0 > 0 such that for every R > R0, the
projection on Rn/Zn of the uniform measure on A(Γ ∩ BR) is ε-close to Lebesgue measure on
Rn/Zn.

Remark 7.22. The proof also allows to suppose that the radius R0 is uniform in a whole
neighbourhood of every matrix A of this open set of matrices.
Proof of Lemma 7.21. During this proof, we consider a distance dist on P (Rn/Zn) which
is invariant under translations. We also suppose that this distance satisﬁes the following
convexity inequality: if µ, ν1,··· , νd ∈ P (Rn/Zn), then

For the simplicity of the notations, when µ and ν have not total mass 1, we will denote
by dist(µ, ν) the distance between the normalizations of µ and ν.
We consider the set Uε of matrices A ∈ GLn(R) satisfying: there exists R0 > 0 such
(cid:88)
that for all R ≥ R0,
ε > 0, Uε contains an open dense set. Then, the set(cid:84)
where ¯δx is the Dirac measure of the projection of x on Rn/Zn. We show that for every
Uε will be a Gδ dense set made
of matrices A ∈ GLn(R) such that A(Γ ) is well distributed.
Let ε > 0, δ > 0, (cid:96) > 0 and A ∈ GLn(R). We apply the second part of Remark 7.10
to obtain a parameter R0 > 0 and a family v1,··· , vn of ε-translations of Γ such that

Remark that we can suppose that this remains true on a whole neighbourhood of A

(cid:48)
We use the fact that Γ is an almost periodic pattern to deduce that A
belongs to the
interior of Uε.

7.3 Diﬀerences in almost periodic patterns

From now, we suppose that the almost periodic patterns we consider are subsets of

Zn.

In the sequel, we will use the concept of diﬀerence in an almost periodic pattern.
The following lemma, whose proof is straightforward, states that the occurrences of a
given diﬀerence in an almost periodic pattern form an almost periodic pattern.
Lemma 7.23. Let v ∈ Rn and Γ be an almost periodic pattern. Then the set

{x ∈ Γ | x + v ∈ Γ} = Γ ∩ (Γ − v)

is an almost periodic pattern.

Then Proposition 7.6 allows to associate to each translation of Zn the frequency it

appears in the almost periodic pattern.
Deﬁnition 7.24. For v ∈ Zn, we set

ρΓ (v) =

D{x ∈ Γ | x + v ∈ Γ}

D(Γ )

(cid:17)

(cid:16)
Γ ∩ (Γ − v)
D(Γ )

D

=

∈ [0,1]

the frequency of the diﬀerence v in the almost periodic pattern Γ .

The function ρΓ is itself almost periodic in the sense given by H. Bohr (see [Boh24]).
Deﬁnition 7.25. Let f : Zn → R. Denoting by Tv the translation of vector v, we say that
f is Bohr almost periodic (also called uniformly almost periodic) if for every ε > 0, the set

(cid:110)

Nε =

v ∈ Zn | (cid:107)f − f ◦ Tv(cid:107)∞ < ε

,

(cid:111)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ε.

is relatively dense.

If f : Zn → R is a Bohr almost periodic function, then it possesses a mean M (f ) (see
for example the historical paper of H. Bohr [Boh24, Satz VIII]), which satisﬁes: for every
ε > 0, there exists R0 > 0 such that for every R ≥ R0 and every x ∈ Rn, we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)M (f )−

(cid:88)

The fact that ρΓ is Bohr almost periodic is straightforward.

Lemma 7.26. If Γ is an almost periodic pattern, then the function ρΓ is Bohr almost periodic.

In fact, we can compute precisely the mean of ρ(Γ ).

Proposition 7.27. If Γ is an almost periodic pattern, then we have

M (ρΓ ) = D(Γ ).

7.3. Diﬀerences in almost periodic patterns

151

Proof of Proposition 7.27. This proof lies primarily in an inversion of limits.

Let ε > 0. As Γ is an almost periodic pattern, there exists R0 > 0 such that for every

R ≥ R0 and every x ∈ Rn, we have(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)D(Γ )− Γ ∩ [B(x, R)]

By Equation (7.9), the second term is ε-close to D(Γ ). Considered independently, the
ﬁrst term is equal to D(Γ ) (still by Equation (7.9)). Thus, we have

that we wanted to prove.

We now state a Minkowski-type theorem for the map ρΓ . To begin with, we recall the
classical Minkowski theorem (see for example [Ber09, IX.3] or the whole book [GL87]).
Theorem 7.28 (Minkowski). Let Λ be a lattice of Rn, k ∈ N and S ⊂ Rn be a centrally
symmetric convex body. If Leb(S/2) > k covol(Λ), then S contains at least 2k distinct points
of Λ\{0}.

In particular, if Leb(S/2) > covol(Λ), then S contains at least one point of Λ \ {0}.
This theorem is optimal in the following sense: for every lattice Λ and for every k ∈ N,
there exists a centrally symmetric convex body S such that Leb(S/2) = k covol(Λ) and
that S contains less than 2k distinct points of Λ\{0}. In Chapter 8, we will make use of
Hajós theorem (Theorem 8.21), which specify what can happen in the case where S is
an inﬁnite ball satisfying Leb(S/2) = covol(Λ).

Proof of Theorem 7.28. We consider the function

(cid:88)

λ∈Λ

ϕ =

1λ+S/2.

The hypothesis about the covolume of Λ and the volume of S/2 imply that the mean of
the periodic function ϕ satisﬁes M (ϕ) > k. In particular, there exists x0 ∈ Rn such that
ϕ(x0) ≥ k+1 (note that this argument is similar to the pigeonhole principle). Then, there

exists λ0,··· , λk ∈ Λ, with the λi sorted in lexicographical order (for a chosen basis), such
(cid:16)
(cid:17)
that the points x0 − λi belong to S/2. As S/2 is centrally symmetric, λi − x0 belongs to
/2 = (λi − λ0)/2 also belongs to S/2. Then,
(x0 − λ0) + (λi − x0)
S/2 and as S/2 is convex,
λi − λ0 ∈ Λ \ {0} ∩ S for every i ∈ (cid:126)1, k(cid:127). By hypothesis, these k vectors are all diﬀerent.
To obtain 2k diﬀerent points of S ∩ Λ \ {0} (instead of k diﬀerent points), it suﬃces to
consider the points λ0− λi; this collection is disjoint from the collection of λi − λ0 by the
fact that the λi are sorted in lexicographical order. This proves the theorem.

With the deﬁnitions we introduced, Minkowski theorem can be seen as a result
about the function ρΓ : Let Λ be a lattice of Rn, and S ⊂ Rn be a centrally symmetric convex
body, then

ρΛ(u) ≥ 2(cid:100)D(Λ)Leb(S/2)(cid:101)− 1.

We now state a similar statement in the more general case of almost periodic patterns.
Theorem 7.29 (in collaboration with É. Joly). Let Γ ⊂ Zn be an almost periodic pattern,
and S ⊂ Rn be a centrally symmetric convex body. Then (recall that [S] = S∩ Zn)

ρΓ (u) ≥ D(Γ )Card[S/2].

Remark that by Theorem 7.28, we have Card[S/2] ≥ 2(cid:100)Leb(S/4)(cid:101)− 1. Thus,

2(cid:100)Leb(S/4)(cid:101)− 1

ρΓ (u) ≥ D(Γ )

Remark 7.30. It is possible to prove in an easier way a weak version of Theorem 7.29
which is suﬃcient for the use we will make (Theorem 8.36). However, it seemed nicer
to us to state a more optimal property.

The case of equality in the theorem is attained even in the non trivial case where
Card[S/2] > 1, as shown by the following example.
Example 7.31. If k is an odd number, if Γ is the lattice kZ × Z, and if S is a centrally
symmetric convex set such that (see Figure 7.5)

then(cid:80)

S∩ Z2 = {(i,0) | i ∈ (cid:126)−(k − 1), k − 1(cid:127)}∪{±(i,1) | i ∈ (cid:126)1, k − 1(cid:127)},

u∈S ρ(u) = 1, D(Γ ) = 1/k and Card(S/2∩ Zn) = k.

The strategy of proof of this theorem is similar to that of the classical Minkowski
theorem: we consider the set Γ + S/2 and deﬁne a suitable auxiliary function based on
this set.

The conclusion of the theorem is an estimate on the right side of this equality; to prove
it we compute the left side in another way.

We now turn to a more precise notion about almost periodicity: model sets. We
begin this section by motivating the introduction of these sets: we give an alternative

construction of the sets(cid:98)A(Zn) in terms of model sets.
A point x ∈ Zn belongs to(cid:98)A(Zn) if and only if there exists y ∈ Zn such that (cid:107)x−Ay(cid:107)∞ <

2. In other words, if we set

if we note p1 and p2 the projections of R2n on respectively the n ﬁrsts and the n last
(cid:110)
(cid:111)
coordinates, and if we set W =]− 1
(cid:98)A(Zn) =
2 , 1
p2(MAv) | v ∈ Z2n, p1(MAv) ∈ W

2]n, then

.

This notion is close to that of model set introduced by Y. Meyer in the early seventies
[Mey72], but in our case the projection p2 is not injective. Model sets are sometimes
called “cut and project” sets in the literature.
Deﬁnition 7.32. Let Λ be a lattice of Rm+n, p1 and p2 the projections of Rm+n on respec-
tively Rm ×{0}Rn and {0}Rm × Rn, and W a Riemann integrable subset of Rm. The model
set modelled on the lattice Λ and the window W is (see Figure 7.6)

(cid:110)

p2(λ) | λ ∈ Λ, p1(λ) ∈ W

.

Γ =

(cid:111)

Here, we will call model set every set of this type, even if the projection p2 is not
injective. Indeed, this phenomenon is what is interesting for us, if it did not occur there
would be no loss of injectivity when applying discretizations of linear maps. Notice that
this deﬁnition, which could seem very restrictive for the set Γ , is in fact quite general: as
stated by Y. Meyer in [Mey72], every Meyer set 5 is a subset of a model set. Conversely,
model sets are Meyer sets (see [Mey95]).

Returning to our problem of images of the lattice Zn by discretizations of linear

maps, we have the following (trivial) result.
that Γ − Γ ⊂ Γ + F (see [Lag96]).

5. A set Γ is a Meyer set if Γ − Γ is a Delone set. It is equivalent to ask that there exists a ﬁnite set F such

Remark 7.34. This notion has the advantage that it builds the k-th image directly: the
concept of time disappears, so we will be able “anticipate” the behaviour of successive
images. The downside is the increasing of the dimension; thus it will be more diﬃcult
to have a geometric intuition. . .

In the sequel, we will only consider model sets whose window is regular.

Deﬁnition 7.35. Let W be a subset of Rn. We say that W is regular if for every aﬃne
subspace V ⊂ Rn, we have

where LebV denotes the Lebesgue measure on V, and BV
the set of points
of V whose distance to ∂(V∩ W) is smaller than η (of course, the boundary is also take
in restriction to V).

The link with the previous sections is made by the following theorem.

Theorem 7.36 (in collaboration with Y. Meyer). A model set modelled on a regular window
is an almost periodic pattern.

In other words, for every ε > 0, there exists R0 > 0 and a relatively dense set N such
that for every v ∈ N and every R ≥ R0, most of the points (i.e. a proportion greater than
ε) of the model set Γ also belong to v + Γ (see Deﬁnition 7.3).

We begin by proving a weak version of this theorem.

Lemma 7.37. A model set modelled on a window with nonempty interior is relatively dense.

Proof of Lemma 7.37. We prove this lemma in the speciﬁc case where the window is Bη
(recall that Bη is the inﬁnite ball of radius η centred at 0). We will use this lemma only
in this case (and the general case can be treated the same way).
Let Γ be a model set modelled on a lattice Λ and a window Bη. We will use the
fact that for any centrally symmetric convex set S ⊂ Rn, if there exists a basis e1,··· , en
of Λ such that for each i, (cid:100)n/2(cid:101)ei ∈ S, then S contains a fundamental domain of Rn/Λ,
that is to say, for every v ∈ Rn, we have (S + v) ∩ Λ (cid:44) ∅. This is due to the fact that the
parallelepiped spanned by the vectors ei is included into the simplex spanned by the
vectors (cid:100)n/2(cid:101)ei.

in particular for D ⊂ ker p1), there exists some points of Λ\{0} arbitrarily close to D. We
also take R > 0 such that

this proves that the model set is relatively dense for the radius R.

Proof of Theorem 7.36. Let Γ be a model set modelled on a lattice Λ and a window W.
First of all, we decompose Λ into three supplementary modules: Λ = Λ1 ⊕ Λ2 ⊕ Λ3,

such that (see [Bou98, Chap. VII, §1, 2]):
1. Λ1 = ker p1 ∩ Λ;
2. p1(Λ2) is discrete;
3. p1(Λ3) is dense in the vector space V it spans (and such a vector space is unique), and
V∩ p1(Λ2) = {0}.
As Λ1 = ker p1 ∩ Λ = im p2 ∩ Λ, we have Λ1 = p2(Λ1). Thus, for every λ1 ∈ Λ1 and every
γ ∈ Γ , we have λ1 + γ ∈ Γ . So Λ1 is a set of periods for Γ . Therefore, considering the
quotients Rn/ span Λ1 and Λ/Λ1 if necessary, we can suppose that p1|Λ is injective (in
other words, Λ1 = {0}).
(cid:17)
(cid:16)
ker p1 ∩ Λ = {0}, we have the decomposition
(cid:124)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:125)

We can see that the projection of the basis of Λ3 on im p2⊕ span

For η > 0, let N (η) be the model set modelled on Λ and B(0, η), that is

N (η) = {p2(λ3) | λ3 ∈ Λ3, (cid:107)p1(λ3)(cid:107)∞ ≤ η}.

Lemma 7.37 asserts that N (η) is relatively dense in the space it spans, and the previous
paragraph asserts that this space is im p2. The next lemma, which obviously implies
Theorem 7.36, expresses that if η is small enough, then N (η) is the set of translations
we look for.
Lemma 7.38. For every ε > 0, there exists η > 0 and a regular model set Q(η) such that
D+(Q(η)) ≤ ε and

v ∈ N (η) ⇒ (Γ + v)∆Γ ⊂ Q(η).

We have now reduced the proof of Theorem 7.36 to that of Lemma 7.38.

Proof of Lemma 7.38. We begin by proving that (Γ + v) \ Γ ⊂ Q(η) when v ∈ N (η). As
v ∈ N (η), there exists λ0 ∈ Λ3 such that p2(λ0) = v and (cid:107)p1(λ0)(cid:107)∞ ≤ η.
If x ∈ Γ + v, then x = p2(λ2 + λ3) + p2(λ0) = p2(λ2 + λ3 + λ0) where λ2 ∈ Λ2, λ3 ∈ Λ3
and p1(λ2 + λ3) ∈ W. If moreover x (cid:60) Γ , it implies that p1(λ2 + λ3 + λ0) (cid:60) W. Thus,
p1(λ2 + λ3 + λ0) ∈ Wη, where (recall that V = span(p1(Λ3)))
(cid:110)
k + w | k ∈ ∂W, w ∈ V∩ Bη
(cid:110)

We have proved that Γ + v \ Γ ⊂ Q(η), where

Q(η) =

Let us stress that the model set Q(η) does not depend on v. We now observe that as W

As p1(Λ3) is dense in V (thus, it is equidistributed), the uniform upper density of the
model set Q(η) deﬁned by the window Wη can be made smaller than ε by taking η small
enough.

The treatment of Γ \ (Γ + v) is similar; this ends the proof of Lemma 7.38.

Chapter 8

Rate of injectivity of linear maps

In this chapter, we focus in more detail on the rate of injectivity of a sequence of

linear maps (see Deﬁnition 7.19).

To begin with, study the easier case of the rate of injectivity in time 1. First of all,
we study the continuity of the map τ = τ1. Unfortunately, this map is not continuous
(Proposition 8.1). However, τ is continuous at every totally irrational matrix 1 (Propo-
sition 8.4). More precisely, we deﬁne the mean rate of injectivity τ(A) of a matrix A:
it is the mean of the rates of injectivity of the aﬃne maps A + v, for v ∈ Rn/Zn (see
Deﬁnition 8.3). It turns out that this quantity is much more convenient to use: by an
argument of equirepartition, it coincides with the rate of injectivity when A is totally
irrational, and it is continuous on the whole set GLn(R) (Proposition 8.4). We ﬁnish
this study by estimating the lack of continuity of τ – that is, the diﬀerence between
τ and τ – at the matrices which are not totally irrational: this diﬀerence is arbitrarily
small out of a topologically small set, that is, out of a locally ﬁnite union of hyperplanes
(Proposition 8.7).

These considerations allow us to focus on the mean rate of injectivity. The equidistri-
bution property we gain by using the mean rate of injectivity allows to have a formula to
compute it directly: for A ∈ GLn(R), we have (Proposition 8.11, see also Proposition 8.18
and Figures 8.2 and 8.9)

 (cid:91)

λ∈AZn

 .

τ(A) = det(A)D

B∞(λ,1/2)

a fundamental domain of AZn and the union of cubes(cid:83)

As the set AZn is a lattice, this quantity is equal to the area of the intersection between
λ∈AZn B∞(λ,1/2): this reduces
the computation of the mean rate of injectivity to that of the area of a ﬁnite union of
cubes. This formula proves that the mean rate of injectivity is continuous and piecewise
polynomial (Corollary 8.13). It also allows to compute the mean rate of injectivity of
some practical examples (see Applications 8.14 and 8.15), and gives a quick method to
compute numerically the mean rate of injectivity (see Figure 8.3).

To characterize the matrices for which the mean rate of injectivity is equal to 1, we
combine this formula with the classical Hajós theorem (Theorem 8.21) and get directly
Corollary 8.22: a matrix A ∈ SLn(R) has a mean rate of injectivity equal to 1 if and
only if there exists B ∈ SLn(Z) such that in a canonical basis of Rn (that is, permuting
1. We say that a matrix A ∈ GLn(R) is totally irrational when the set A(Zn) is equidistributed modulo

Zn.

coordinates if necessary), the matrix AB is upper triangular with ones on the diago-
nal. Thus, the set of such matrices forms a locally ﬁnite union of manifolds of positive
codimension.

We then study the behaviour of the asymptotic rate of injectivity of a generic se-
quence of matrices of SLn(R). It is given by the main theorem of this chapter (Theo-
rem P, see also Theorem 8.24): for a generic sequence (Ak)k≥1 of matrices of SLn(R), we
have τ

∞(cid:16)

= 0.

(cid:17)

(Ak)k

The end of the chapter is devoted to the study of this theorem and some variations
on it. The ﬁrst variant is given in the (easy) case where all the matrices are diago-
nal (Proposition 8.27): for a generic sequence (Ak)k≥1 of diagonal matrices, we have
∞
τ

((Ak)k) = 0.
In the general case, we give a proof of the following weak version of Theorem 8.24
((Ak)k) ≤
(Theorem 8.30): if (Ak)k≥1 is a generic sequence of matrices of SLn(R), then τ
(cid:16)
1/2. This proof involves the study of the diﬀerences in an almost periodic pattern:
the frequency of the diﬀerence v ∈ Zn in the almost periodic pattern Γ is the quantity
(Γ − v)∩ Γ ) (see Deﬁnition 7.24). To start the proof, we remark that if Γ ⊂ Zn is
ρΓ (v) = D
an almost periodic pattern whose density is bigger than 1/2+δ, then for every v ∈ Zn, the
frequency of the diﬀerence v in Γ satisﬁes ρΓ (v) ≥ 2δ (Lemma 8.29). The theorem results
from this remark and from the fact that matrices with a rate of injectivity equal to 1 are
very rare (Corollary 8.22). The proof also uses crucially the geometric construction used
to compute the mean rate of injectivity τ (Proposition 8.11).

((Pk)k) = 0.

We then state a variation of Theorem P in the case of isometries (Theorem 8.36) : if

(Pk)k≥1 is a generic sequence of matrices of On(R), then τ
sition 8.33). We show that the discretization (cid:98)A of A ∈ GLn(R) acts smoothly on the
To prove this result, we study in more detail the action of the discretizations of lin-
ear maps on the frequencies of the diﬀerences of an almost periodic pattern (Propo-
frequency of diﬀerences: when we want to compute(cid:98)A(Γ ), we apply A and then make
a projection, whereas when we want to compute ρ(cid:98)A(Γ ), we apply A and then make
a weighted projection. To prove Theorem Q, we combine this computation with the
Minkowski-like theorem for the diﬀerences in an almost periodic pattern we obtained
in the previous chapter (Theorem 7.29).
Finally, we use the notion of model set 2 (Deﬁnition 7.32) to improve Theorem 8.30.
It is deﬁned as follows: given a lattice Λ of Rm+n and a “regular” set W ⊂ Rm, we select
the points of the lattice whose projection on the m ﬁrst coordinates belongs to W; the
projection on the n last coordinates of these points is called the model set modelled on
Λ and W. Model sets form a subclass of almost periodic patterns (Theorem 7.36). The
introduction of this notion is supported by the fact that for every sequence (Ak)k≥1 of

invertible linear maps, the set ((cid:99)Ak ◦···◦(cid:99)A1)(Zn) is a model set (Proposition 7.33). This

fact gives us a more precise information about the structure of the successive images
of Zn by discretizations of linear maps, as the deﬁnition of model set is stronger than
that of almost periodic pattern. This viewpoint is fruitful to study the question raised
in Theorem P: ﬁrst of all, an argument of equidistribution leads to a generalization
of the geometric construction to compute the mean rate of injectivity in time 1 to the
rate of injectivity in arbitrary time k (Propositions 8.40 and 8.46). Moreover, these
constructions allows us to give an alternative proof of Theorem 8.30, and to ﬁnally
prove Theorem P.

8.1 Study of the continuity of the rate of injectivity

•

•

In this section, we study the properties of continuity of the function τ. We ﬁrst show
that there exists some matrices in which τ is not continuous (Proposition 8.1). However,
we show in Proposition 8.4 that τ is continuous at every totally irrational matrix; more
precisely, the map τ coincides with the mean rate of injectivity τ (Deﬁnition 8.3) on the
set of totally irrational matrices, and the map τ is continuous on the whole set GLn(R).
We ﬁnish this section in estimating the lack of continuity of τ at the matrices which are
not totally irrational (Proposition 8.7).

In the following example, we show that on some rational matrices, the rate of injec-
tivity is not continuous. In particular, it will give us an example where Lemma 7.16 is
not true when there is no restriction about the value of v on IQ(A) (the set of indices
corresponding to rational coeﬃcients, see Notation 7.13).

Our counterexample is given by irrational perturbations of the matrix

It can be easily seen that the rate of injectivity of f0 is 1/2 (see Figure 8.1). Remark
that it depends on the choice made for the projection of R2 on Z2: if we make the same
choice for both directions (that is what we have chosen in Deﬁnition 7.11) then the rate
of injectivity is 1/2, otherwise this rate of injectivity is 1. For ε “small”, we consider the
linear map

which is close to f0 when ε is small.
Proposition 8.1. The rate of injectivity of fε tends 3

In particular, the rate of injectivity τ is not continuous in f0.

2.
2[ modulo Zn, the rate of injectivity of f0 + v is 1.
Proof of Lemma 8.2. We want to know when it is possible to ﬁnd two diﬀerent vectors
x, y ∈ Zn such that π(f0x + v) = π(f0y + v). This implies that d∞(f0x, f0y) < 1, a simple
calculation (see Figure 8.1) shows that in this case, x = y ± (1,0). As f0(2Z× Z) ⊂ Z2, we

162
Chapter 8. Rate of injectivity of linear maps
can suppose that x = 0 ; we want to know if for y = ±(1,0), we have π(f0x+v) = π(f0y+v),
that is π(v) = π(v ± (1/2,1/2)). Again, a simple calculation shows that this occurs if and
only if v ∈]0, 1

2[2∪]− 1

2 ,0[2.

Thus, for half of the vectors v (for Lebesgue measure), the rate of injectivity of f0 + v
is 1 and for the other half of the vectors v, the rate of injectivity of f0 + v is 1
2. Propo-
sition 8.1 then follows from an argument of equirepartition. To make it rigorous, we
deﬁne the mean rate of injectivity.
(cid:90)
Deﬁnition 8.3. For A ∈ GLn(R), the quantity

τ(A) =

Tn

τ(A + v) d v

is called the mean rate of injectivity of A.

We say that a matrix A ∈ GLn(R) is totally irrational if the image A(Zn) is equidis-
tributed 3 modulo Zn; in particular, this is true when the coeﬃcients of A form a Q-free
family.

The motivation of this deﬁnition is that the mean rate of injectivity is continuous

and coincides with the rate of injectivity on totally irrational matrices.

Proposition 8.4. The mean rate of injectivity τ is continuous on GLn(R). Moreover, if A is
totally irrational, then τ(A) = τ(A); and even more, τ(A) = τ(A + v) for every v ∈ Tn.

Thus, the restriction of the rate of injectivity to totally irrational matrices is a con-
tinuous function, which extends to GLn(R) into a continuous function. In particular, the
restriction of this function to any bounded subset of SLn(R) is uniformly continuous.

Proposition 8.4, combined with Lemma 8.2, obviously implies Proposition 8.1 (as

for ε (cid:60) Q, the map fε is totally irrational).

Proof of Proposition 8.4. The continuity of τ will be obtained later as a direct conse-
quence of Corollary 8.13.
Let A ∈ GLn(R) be a totally irrational matrix. We want to prove that τ(A) = τ(A). To
do that, we show that τ(A) = τ(A+ v) for every v ∈ Tn. As {Ax | x ∈ Zn} is equidistributed
modulo Zn, for every v ∈ Tn, there exists x ∈ Zn such that d∞(v − Ax,Zn) < ε. But as the
density is a limit independent from the choice of the centre of the ball (Corollary 7.7
and Theorem 7.12), we have

.

This proves that τ(A) = τ(A + Ax). We then use Remark 7.18, which states that as A is
totally irrational, the function v (cid:55)→ τ(A+v) is continuous. As the vector Ax is arbitrarily
close to the vector v, we get τ(A) = τ(A + v).
Remark 8.5. The same proof shows that if Γ ⊂ Zn is an almost periodic pattern, and
A ∈ GLn(R) is such that A(Γ ) is equidistributed modulo Zn (which is true for a generic
A, see Lemma 7.21), then B (cid:55)→ D

(cid:16)(cid:98)B(Γ )
(cid:17)

is continuous in B = A.

3. It is equivalent to require that it is dense instead of equidistributed; it is also equivalent to ask that

Zn is equidistributed modulo A(Zn).

8.1. Study of the continuity of the rate of injectivity

163

We now study the behaviour of τ at the matrices where it is not continuous. In
particular, we prove that the set of matrices on which the rate of injectivity makes “big
jumps” is small. More precisely, we deﬁne the oscillation of a map.
Deﬁnition 8.6. For A ∈ GLn(R), the oscillation of τ at A is the quantity

To prove this proposition, we will need a technical lemma which requires the fol-

lowing deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 8.8. Let Λ be a lattice of Rn. Then [Bou98, Chap. VII, §1, 2] implies that the
Z-module Λ + Zn can be decomposed into two complementary modules

Λ + Zn = Λcont ⊕ Λdiscr,

such that Λcont is dense in the vector space it spans and Λdiscr is discrete.

During the proof of Proposition 8.7, we will make use of the following lemma, that
we will not prove.
Lemma 8.9. For every ε > 0, the set of matrices A ∈ GLn(R) such that (AZn)discr has a
fundamental domain of diameter smaller than ε contains the complement of a locally ﬁnite
union of hyperplanes.

Remark that if A is totally irrational, then (AZn)discr = {0}

Proof of Proposition 8.7. Let ε > 0. We consider a matrix A ∈ GLn(R) such that (AZn)discr
has a fundamental domain D of diameter smaller than ε; Lemma 8.9 asserts that such
matrices contains the complement of a locally ﬁnite union of hyperplanes. We denote
Λ = AZn. We use Proposition 8.4, which states that τ is continuous and coincides with
τ on totally irrational matrices, to estimate the oscillation of τ in A : it is smaller than

8.2 A geometric viewpoint on the mean rate

•

In this section, we present two geometric constructions to compute the rate of injec-

tivity of a matrix.
First construction Let A ∈ GLn(R) and Λ = A(Zn). The density of π(Λ) is the pro-
portion of x ∈ Zn belonging to π(Λ); in other words the proportion of x ∈ Zn such that
there exists λ ∈ Λ whose distance to x (for (cid:107)·(cid:107)∞) is smaller than 1/2. This property only
depends on the value of x modulo Λ. If we consider the union

(cid:91)

λ∈Λ

U =

B(λ,1/2)

of balls of radius 1/2 centred on the points of Λ (see Figure 8.2), then x ∈ π(Λ) if and
only if x ∈ U∩Zn. So, if we set ν the measure of repartition of the x ∈ Zn modulo Λ, that
is

(cid:88)

ν = lim
R→+∞

Card(BR ∩ Zn)

δprRn/Λ(x),

x∈BR∩Zn

then we obtain the following formula (using also Equation (7.7), which links τ(A) and
D(Λ)).
Proposition 8.10. For every A ∈ GLn(R) (we identify U with its projection of Rn/Λ),

(cid:16)
τ(A) = |det(A)|D

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

= |det(A)|ν

π(Λ)

prRn/Λ(U)

.

In particular, when the matrix A is totally irrational, the measure ν is the uniform
measure; thus if D is a fundamental domain of Rn/Λ, then τ(A) is the area of D ∩ U.
The same holds for the mean rate of injectivity and any matrix (not necessarily totally
irrational).
(cid:16)
Proposition 8.11. For every A ∈ GLn(R),

(cid:17)

τ(A) = |det(A)|Leb

prRn/Λ(U)

= |det(A)|Leb(U∩ D ).

Thus, the mean rate of injectivity can be seen as the area of an intersection of parallelepipeds
(see Figure 8.2).

8.2. A geometric viewpoint on the mean rate

Figure 8.3: Mean rate of injectivity on SL2(R) on the fundamental domain D (more
precisely, D = {z ∈ C | |z| > 1, Im z > 0, −1/2 < Re z < 1/2}) of the modular surface, for
various angles in T1D (0, π/10, π/5, 3π/10, 2π/5, π/2).

With the same kind of arguments, we easily obtain a formula for ρ(cid:98)A(Zn)(v) (the fre-
quency of the diﬀerence v in(cid:98)A(Zn), see Deﬁnition 7.24).
Proposition 8.12. If A ∈ GLn(R) is totally irrational, then for every v ∈ Zn,
(cid:98)A(Zn) are such that x + v also belongs to Γ . But modulo Λ = A(Zn), x belongs to Γ if and
Sketch of proof of Proposition 8.12. We want to know which proportion of points x ∈ Γ =
only if x ∈ B(0,1/2). Similarly, x + v belongs to Γ if and only if x ∈ B(−v,1/2). Thus, by
equirepartition, ρ(cid:98)A(Zn)(v) is equal to the area of B(v,1/2)∩ U.

ρ(cid:98)A(Zn)(v) = Leb

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

B(v,1/2)∩ U

.

From Proposition 8.11, we deduce the continuity of τ.

Corollary 8.13. The mean rate of injectivity is a continuous function on GLn(R), which is
locally polynomial with degree smaller than n in the coeﬃcients of the matrix.

Moreover, this construction gives a quick algorithm to compute numerically the
mean rate of injectivity of some matrices: this algorithm is much more eﬃcient than
the naive one consisting in computing the cardinality of the image of a large ball by the
discretization, see Figure 8.3 and Figure 8.4.

It also allows to compute simply the mean rate of injectivity of some examples of
matrices.
Application 8.14. For θ ∈ [0, π/2], the mean rate of injectivity of a rotation of R2 of angle
θ is (see Figure 8.5).

τ(Rθ) = 1− (cos(θ) + sin(θ)− 1)2.

geodesic (on the horizontal axis). The mean rate of injectivity of each lattice has been

rate of injectivity of a lattice having one

Application 8.15. We consider a lattice of R2 of covolume 1 with one basis vector parallel
with the horizontal axis. We have several cases:
1. If the length (cid:96) of the vector parallel with the horizontal axis is smaller than 1, then
the mean rate of injectivity is equal to (cid:96), independently from the choice of the second
basis vector (see Figure 8.6).
2. If the length (cid:96) is bigger than 1 but smaller than 2, we choose v = (x,1/(cid:96)) another basis
vector of the lattice. We can suppose that −(cid:96)/2 ≤ x ≤ (cid:96)/2; by symmetry we only treat
the case x ∈ [0, (cid:96)/2]. The mean rate of injectivity is then a piecewise aﬃne map with
respect to x:
– if (cid:96) − 1 ≤ x ≤ (cid:96)/2, then the mean rate of injectivity is constant and equal to 1− ((cid:96) −
1)(2/(cid:96) − 1) = (cid:96) − 2 + 2/(cid:96) (see Figure 8.7);
– if 0 ≤ x ≤ (cid:96) − 1, then the mean rate of injectivity is equal to 1− ((cid:96) − 1)(2/(cid:96) − 1)− (1−
1/(cid:96))((cid:96) − 1− x) = 1/(cid:96) + x− x/(cid:96) (see Figure 8.8).

We do not treat the other cases where (cid:96) > 2.

These properties can be also directly deduced from the ﬁrst geometric construction
by applying a double counting argument. We state it in more general context because
we will need a more precise statement in the sequel (here, we only need the case m = 0,
thus B1 = B); this lemma allows to compute the area of the projection of a set on a
quotient by a lattice.

Lemma 8.19. Let Λ1 be a subgroup of Rm which is a lattice in the vector space it spans, Λ2
be such that Λ1 ⊕ Λ2 is a lattice of covolume 1 of Rm, and B be a compact subset of Rm. Let

B1 be the projection of B on the quotient Rm/Λ1, and B2 the projection of B on the quotient
Rm/(Λ1 ⊕ Λ2). We denote by

Then,

Leb(B2) =

.

In particular, the area of B2 (the projection on the quotient by the direct sum of both
lattices) is smaller than (or equal to) that of B1 (the projection on the quotient by the
ﬁrst lattice). The loss of area is given by the following corollary.

Corollary 8.20. With the same notations as for Lemma 8.19, if we denote by

8.3 When is the rate close to 1?

Obviously, the rate of injectivity τ(A) of any matrix of A ∈ SLn(Z) is equal to 1. In
Section 8.1, we have found other examples of aﬃne maps with determinant 1 whose
rate of injectivity is also 1. Also, in Application 8.15, taking (cid:96) = 1, this gives another
class of examples where the rate of injectivity is one. In this section, we investigate more
in detail this question: what are the matrices with determinant 1 whose mean rate of
injectivity is 1? With Proposition 8.11, we can reformulate this question in terms of
intersection of cubes: if det(A) = 1, τ(A) = 1 if and only if the cubes B(λ,1/2), with
λ ∈ AZn, tile the space Rn. This is a classical problem raised by H. Minkowski in 1896
(see [Min10]), and answered by G. Hajós in 1941.

Theorem 8.21 (Hajós, [Haj41]). Let Λ be a lattice of Rn. Then the collection of squares
{B(λ,1/2)}λ∈Λ tiles the plane if and only if in a canonical basis of Rn (that is, permuting
coordinates if necessary), Λ admits a generating matrix which is upper triangular with ones
on the diagonal.

Chapter 8. Rate of injectivity of linear maps

This theorem can be stated geometrically: if the collection of squares tiles the space
Rn, then at least two of these squares have a face in common. The conclusion of The-
orem 8.21 can then be inferred by induction, quotienting in the direction which is or-
thogonal to this face and iterating the argument. The proof of this theorem involves
ﬁne results of group theory; we will not prove it here in the general case (see for exam-
ple the excellent book [SS94] for a complete investigation on the subject). Remark that
Hajós theorem studies a particular case of the case of equality in Minkowski’s theorem
(Theorem 7.28): it states a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a lattice with covol-
ume 1 to possess a non-trivial point in the boundary of the unit square centred at 0,
but no non-trivial point in its interior. We give an elementary proof of Hajós theorem
in dimension 2 (for dimension 3, there is also an elementary proof, see for example the
book of H. Minkowski [Min07]).
Proof of Theorem 8.21 in dimension 2. Let Λ be a lattice of R2 such that the family
{B(λ,1/2)}λ∈Λ tiles the plane. We consider the point x1 = (1/2,0). By the hypothesis
of tiling, there exists λ1 ∈ Λ\{0} such that x1 ∈ B(λ1,1/2). Remark that this implies that
λ1 has the form λ1 = (1, y). We have two cases.
1. If λ1 = (1,0), then we consider the point x2 = (0,1/2) and again, there exists λ2 ∈ Λ\{0}
such that x ∈ B(λ2,1/2). The vector λ2 has the form λ2 = (∗,1), thus the basis (λ1, λ2)
of Λ has the desired form.

2. If λ1 = (1, y) (cid:44) (1,0), we suppose that y > 0 (doing a symmetry if necessary). Con-
sidering the point x2 = (1/2,1/2), this implies that λ2 = (0,1) belongs to Λ (in other
words, x2 ∈ B(λ2,1/2)). The basis (λ1, λ2) of Λ has the desired form.

Combined with the results of the previous section (more precisely, Proposition 8.18),
Hajós theorem (Theorem 8.21) leads to the following corollary.
Corollary 8.22. A matrix A ∈ SLn(R) has a mean rate of injectivity equal to 1 if and only if
there exists B ∈ SLn(Z) such that in a canonical basis of Rn (that is, permuting coordinates if
necessary), the matrix AB is upper triangular with ones on the diagonal (equivalently, if and
only if there exists a permutation matrix P and a matrix B ∈ SLn(Z) such that PAB is upper
triangular with ones on the diagonal). Remark that the set of such matrices is a locally ﬁnite
union of manifolds of positive codimension.

This metric is complete, thus there is a good notion of genericity on the set of
bounded sequences of matrices of determinant 1 (see page 12). We give the main theo-
rem of this chapter, which states the behaviour of the asymptotic rate of injectivity of a
sequence of matrices (stated in the introduction as Theorem P).

= 0.

This statement was motivated by some numerical simulations (see Figure 7.3
page 147). In Part 3, we will deduce from this theorem a similar statement for generic
diﬀeomorphisms of the torus (Theorem 11.26).

Remark 8.25. This statement remain true if we replace “for a generic sequence of matri-
ces (Ak)k≥1 of SLn(R)” by “for a generic sequence of matrices (Ak)k≥1 among matrices of
determinant ±1”: the property we will need in the proofs is that the matrices preserve
the volume of Rn.
Remark 8.26. Remark 8.5 implies that for a generic sequence (Ai)i≥1 of matrices of
SLn(R) and for every k ∈ N∗
, the map (Bi)i≥1 (cid:55)→ τk(B1,··· , Bk) is continuous in A1,··· , Ak.
Thus, as the asymptotic rate of injectivity is the inﬁmum of the rates of injectivity in
times k for k ∈ N∗
, it is upper semi continuous on every generic sequence of matrices. In
particular, for every generic sequence (Ai)i≥1 of matrices of SLn(R), and every ε > 0 there
exists a neighbourhood of this sequence on which the asymptotic rate of injectivity is
smaller than ε.

We begin the study of Theorem 8.24 by handling the easiest case: the result is true
when we restrict to diagonal matrices (in the canonical basis). More precisely, the set of
diagonal matrices is a Baire space, so we can talk about generic diagonal matrices, and
we have the following property.

Proposition 8.27 easily follows from Lemma 8.28 and the following property, which
is speciﬁc to the case where the matrices are diagonal: the rate of injectivity of A1,··· , Ak
is smaller than the smallest eigenvalue of A1◦···◦Ak. Indeed, the eigenspace associated
to this eigenvalue λ is stable by discretization, and on this eigenspace the image of a big
ball of radius R is included in a ball of radius λR + o(R).

8.5 Frequency of diﬀerences and a ﬁrst result: the asymptotic

rate of injectivity is generically smaller than 1/2

In this section, we prove a weak version of Theorem 8.24, which states that the rate
of injectivity of a generic sequence of matrices is smaller than one half. It is based on
the following lemma, which asserts that if a diﬀerence appears rarely in Γ , then the rate
of injectivity of Γ is small.
Lemma 8.29. Let Γ ⊂ Zn be an almost periodic pattern, and ρ0 ∈]0,1[. If D(Γ ) ≥ 1
2−ρ0
for every v ∈ Zn, we have ρΓ (v) ≥ ρ0.

, then

8.5. Frequency of diﬀerences: the rate is smaller than 1/2
173
Proof of Lemma 8.29. We argue by contraposition and suppose that there exists v0 ∈ Zn
such that ρΓ (v0) ≤ ρ0. We set Γv0 = {x ∈ Γ | x + v0 (cid:60) Γ}, thus we have D(Γv0) ≥ (1− ρ0)D(Γ ).
But Γ ∩ (Γv0 + v0) = ∅, so D(Γ ) + D(Γv0 + v0) ≤ 1, which implies that D(Γ )(1 + 1− ρ0) ≤ 1.
Theorem 8.30. Let (Ak)k≥1 be a generic sequence of matrices of SLn(R). Then there exists
a parameter λ ∈]0,1[ such that for every k ≥ 1, we have τk(A1,··· , Ak) ≤ (λk + 1)/2. In
particular, τ

((Ak)k) ≤ 1/2.

∞

The proof of this theorem is based on an argument of equirepartition, which trans-

lates the problem in terms of areas of intersections of cubes.
Lemma 8.31. Let δ > 0 and M > 0. Then there exists V0 > 0 such that for all A ∈ SLn(R) with
(cid:107)A(cid:107) ≤ M, there exists B ∈ SLn(R) totally irrational, with (cid:107)B− A(cid:107) ≤ δ, there exist a polygon
P ⊂ Tn whose volume is bigger than V0, and some v0 ∈ Zn \{0}, such that if Bx ∈ P mod Zn,
then π(Bx) = π(B(x + v0)).
Proof of Lemma 8.31. Hajós theorem (Theorem 8.21, see also Corollary 8.22) proves that
for ε > 0 small enough, the set of matrices B ∈ SLn(R) such that for every v ∈ Zn \ {0},
(cid:107)Bv(cid:107)∞ > 1 − ε is a small neighbourhood of a locally ﬁnite union of manifolds. Thus,
there exists ε = ε(δ, M) > 0 such that for all A ∈ SLn(R) with (cid:107)A(cid:107) ≤ M, there exists B ∈
SLn(R) and v0 ∈ Zn \ {0} such that (cid:107)B− A(cid:107) ≤ δ and (cid:107)Bv0(cid:107)∞ < 1 − ε. As totally irrational
matrices are dense among SLn(R), we can moreover suppose that B is totally irrational.
We now set P = B(0,1/2)∩ B(−v0,1/2) ⊂ Rn/Zn (we identify Rn/Zn with its fundamental
domain B(0,1/2)). The volume of P is bigger than V0 = εn. Reasoning as in the proof of
Proposition 8.17, we get that if Bx ∈ P mod Zn, then π(Bx) = π(B(x + v0)).
Proof of Theorem 8.30. We prove the theorem by induction. Suppose that the theorem
is proved for a rank k ∈ N. We set

Γk = ((cid:98)Bk ◦···◦(cid:98)B1)(Zn)

and

ρ0 = 2− 1
D(Γk)

.

By Theorem 7.12, Γk is an almost periodic pattern.
Lemma 8.31 applied to A = Ak+1, δ and M = (cid:107)(Ai)i(cid:107) + δ gives us a parameter V0 > 0
(depending only on δ and M), a polygon P ⊂ Tn of volume greater than V0, a matrix B =
Bk+1 and a vector v0 ∈ Zn \{0}. Lemma 8.29 implies that ρΓk(v0) ≥ ρ0. But Lemma 7.21
asserts that for a generic set of matrices B, the set B(Γk) is equidistributed modulo Zn;
perturbing a little B if necessary, we suppose that it is true. These facts imply that

and thus, as Bx ∈ P mod Zn implies(cid:98)B(x) =(cid:98)B(x + v0), we get

D{x ∈ Γk | Bx ∈ P mod Zn, x + v0 ∈ Γk} ≥ V0ρ0D(Γk),
D(Bk+1(Γk)) ≤ D(Γk)− V0ρ0D(Γk) = D(Γk)(1− V0ρ0).

But ρ0 = 2− 1

D(Γ ), thus (we can suppose that V0 ≤ 1/2)

Setting λ = 1 − 2V0, we obtain the general term of an arithmetico-geometric sequence,
this proves the theorem for the rank k + 1.

8.6 Diﬀusion process and the case of isometries

Unfortunately, problems arise when we try to perturb a sequence of matrices to
make its asymptotic rate smaller than 1/2. First of all, if the density of an almost peri-
odic pattern Γ is smaller than 1/2, then the set of diﬀerences may not be the full set Zn.
Even worse, it might happen that this set of diﬀerences has big holes, as shown by the
following example. We take the almost periodic pattern

Γ =

For every x ∈ Γ and v ∈ (cid:126)40,60(cid:127), x +v (cid:60) Γ . In other words, for every v ∈ (cid:126)40,60(cid:127), we have
ρΓ (v) = 0, whereas D(Γ ) = 0.4. However, the things are not too bad for the frequencies of
diﬀerences when we are close to 0, as shown by the Minkowski-like theorem for almost
periodic patterns (Theorem 7.29).

Diﬀusion process
In this paragraph, we study the action of a discretization of a ma-
trix on the set of diﬀerences of an almost periodic pattern Γ ; more precisely, we study
the link between the functions ρΓ and ρ(cid:98)A(Γ ).
For u ∈ Rn, we deﬁne the function ϕu, which is a “weighted projection” of u on Zn.
Deﬁnition 8.32. Given u ∈ Rn, the function ϕu = Zn → [0,1] is deﬁned by
(cid:81)n
In particular, the function ϕu satisﬁes (cid:80)
i=1(1−|ui + vi|)

The following property asserts that the discretization(cid:98)A acts “smoothly” on the fre-

ply a diﬀusion process. In the other case where D((cid:98)AΓ ) < D(Γ ), we only have inequalities

Remark 8.34. This proposition expresses that the action of the discretization of a linear

Proof of Proposition 8.33. We begin by proving the ﬁrst point of the proposition. Sup-

pose that P ∈ On(R) is generic and that D((cid:98)A(Γ )) = D(Γ ). Let x ∈ Γ ∩ (Γ − v). We consider
the projection y

are equidistributed modulo Zn. In particular, the
Lemma 7.21). Thus, the points x
diﬀerence v will spread into the diﬀerences which are the support of the function ϕPv,
and each of them will occur with a frequency given by ϕPv(x)ρΓ (v). The hypothesis
about the fact that the density of the sets does not decrease imply that the contributions

of each diﬀerence of Γ to the diﬀerences of(cid:98)A(Γ ) add.

In the general case, the contributions to each diﬀerence of Γ may overlap. However,
applying the argument of the previous case, we can easily prove the second part of the
proposition.

Remark 8.35. We also remark that:

(i) the density strictly decreases (that is, D((cid:98)A(Γ )) < D(Γ )) if and only if there exists
v0 ∈ Zn such that ρΓ (v0) > 0 and (cid:107)Av0(cid:107)∞ < 1;

In the previous section, the starting point of the proof was Lemma 8.29, which
ensures that when the rate of injectivity is bigger than 1/2, the frequency of any dif-
ference is bigger than a constant depending on the rate. Here, the starting point is
the Minkowski theorem for almost periodic patterns (Theorem 7.29), which gives one
nonzero diﬀerence whose frequency is positive. The rest of the proof of Theorem 8.36
consists in using again an argument of equidistribution. More precisely, we apply suc-
cessively the following lemma, which asserts that given an almost periodic pattern Γ
of density D0, a sequence of isometries and δ > 0, then, perturbing each isometry of at
most δ if necessary, we can make the density of the k0-th image of Γ smaller than λ0D0,
with k0 and λ0 depending only on D0 and δ. The proof of this lemma involves the study

We begin by proving that this lemma implies Theorem 8.36.

Proof of Theorem 8.36. Suppose that Lemma 8.37 is true. Let τ0 ∈]0,1[ and δ > 0. We
want to prove that we can perturb the sequence (Pk)k into a sequence (Qk)k of isometries,
which is δ-close to (Pk)k and is such that its asymptotic rate is smaller than τ0 (and that
this remains true on a whole neighbourhood of these matrices).

Thus, we can suppose that τ

((Pk)) > τ0. We apply Lemma 8.37 to obtain the pa-

λ0(D, δ) is decreasing in D). Applying the lemma (cid:96) times, this gives a sequence (Qk)k
of isometries, which is δ-close to (Pk)k, such that, as long as τ(cid:96)k0(Q0,··· , Q(cid:96)k0) > τ0/2,
we have τ(cid:96)k0(Q1,··· , Q(cid:96)k0) < λ(cid:96)

Proof of Lemma 8.37. The idea of the proof is the following. Firstly, we apply the
Minkowski-type theorem for almost periodic patterns (Theorem 7.29) to ﬁnd a uni-
form constant C > 0 and a point u0 ∈ Zn \ {0} whose norm is “not too big”, such that
ρΓ (u0) > CD(Γ ). Then, we apply Proposition 8.33 to prove that the diﬀerence u0 in Γ

(cid:48)
Lemma 7.21 (which states that if the sequence (Qk)k is generic, then the matrices Qk
are “non resonant”), we build a sequence (Qk)k≥1 of totally irrational matrices of On(R)
such that for every k ∈ N∗
– (cid:107)Pk − Qk(cid:107) ≤ δ;
– the set Qk ◦ (cid:91)Qk−1 ◦···◦(cid:99)Q1(Γ ) is equidistributed modulo Zn.
– for every x ∈ [B

(cid:48)
We then consider the diﬀerence u0 (given by Equation (8.5)). We denote by (cid:98)P(cid:99)(u)
(cid:48) ≤ n that contains P(u) which has
the point of the smallest integer cube of dimension n
the smallest Euclidean norm (that is, the point of the support of ϕP(u) with the smallest

Remark 8.38. We could be tempted to try to apply this strategy of proof to any sequence
of matrices in SLn(R). However, this does not work in the general case, because if we
consider a non-Euclidean norm N, there could be some x ∈ Rn such that for every vertex
y of the cube containing x, we have N(y) ≥ N(x).

We now set out a conjecture which states a generic dichotomy for the behaviour of
the frequency of diﬀerences for discretizations of generic sequences of matrices, in the
same vein as [Boc02] (for dimension 2) or [ACW14] (in the general case).

Conjecture 8.39. Let (Ak)k≥1 be a generic sequence of matrices of SLn(R). Then, if we note

Γk = ((cid:98)Ak ◦ ··· ◦(cid:98)A1)(Zn), the standard deviation of ρΓk is either very small, either as big as

possible. More precisely, the standard deviation of

(cid:113)

either tends to 0 as k goes to inﬁnity (which corresponds to the case of zero Lyapunov expo-
nent), or tends to 1 as k goes to inﬁnity (which corresponds to the hyperbolic case).

The idea underlying the conjecture is that for for every ε > 0, for every generic se-

quence (Ak)k≥1 of matrices and every k big enough, we have two cases.

– Either

(cid:27)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ρΓk(v) ∈ [ε,1− ε]

< ε,

which means that ρΓk(v) is very close to its mean on a set of density almost 1. This
corresponds to the zero Lyapunov exponent case, and the idea is that diﬀusion
process wins on the hyperbolicity of the sequence of matrices.

– Or

v ∈ Zn

which means that ρΓk(v) is very close to 0 or 1 on a set of density almost 1. This

sequence of matrices wins on the diﬀusion process.

8.7 Applications of the notion of model set

This section is devoted to the application of the notion of model set to the computa-

tion of the rate of injectivity of a ﬁnite number of matrices.

We take advantage of the rational independence between the matrices of a generic
sequence to generalize to arbitrary times the geometric formulas of Section 8.2. The
end of the present section is devoted to the proof of the main theorem of this chapter
(Theorem 8.24).

Let us summarize the diﬀerent notations we will use throughout this section. We
will denote by 0k the origin of the space Rk, and Wk =] − 1/2,1/2]nk (unless otherwise
stated). In this section, we will denote Dc(E) the density of a “continuous” set E ⊂ Rn,
deﬁned as (when the limit exists)

Dc(E) = lim
R→+∞

Leb(BR ∩ E)
Leb(BR)

,

while for a discrete set E ⊂ Rn, the notation Dd(E) will indicate the discrete density of
E, deﬁned as (when the limit exists)

We will consider (Ak)k≥1 a sequence of matrices of SLn(R), and denote

,

Dd(E) = lim
R→+∞

Card(BR ∩ E)
Card(BR ∩ Zn)
Γk = ((cid:99)Ak ◦···◦(cid:99)A1)(Zn).

Λk = MA1,··· ,AkZn(k+1), p1 the projection on the nk ﬁrst coordinates, p2 the projection on
the n last coordinates and Wk =]− 1/2,1/2]nk.

Here, we suppose that the set p1(Λk) is dense (thus, equidistributed) in the image
set im p1 (note that this condition is generic among the sequences of invertible linear
maps). In particular, the set {p2(γ) | γ ∈ Λk} is equidistributed in the window Wk.
The following property makes the link between the density of Γk – that is, the rate
of injectivity of A1,··· , Ak – and the density of the union of unit cubes centred on the
points of the lattice Λk.
Proposition 8.40. For a generic sequence of matrices (Ak)k of SL2(R), we have

Equivalently, we have

Dd(Γk) = Dc

Wk+1 + Λk

Of course, this proposition generalizes Proposition 8.11 to an arbitrary number of
matrices A1,··· , Ak. Remark that this kind of ideas was already present in [Bla97, The-
orem 5.3.1].
Remark 8.41. The density on the left of the equality is the density of a discrete set (that
is, with respect to counting measure), whereas the density on the right of the equality
is that of a continuous set (that is, with respect to Lebesgue measure). The two notions
coincide when we consider discrete sets as sums of Dirac masses.

This proposition leads to the deﬁnition of the mean rate of injectivity in time k.

Deﬁnition 8.42. Let (Ak)k≥1 be a sequence of matrices of SLn(R). The mean rate of
injectivity in time k of this sequence is deﬁned by

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

τk(A1,··· , Ak) = Dc

Wk+1 + Λk

.

Remark 8.43. As in Section 8.2 for the rate of injectivity in time 1, Proposition 8.40 as-
serts that for a generic sequence of matrices, the rate of injectivity τk in time k coincides
with the mean rate of injectivity τk, which is continuous and piecewise polynomial of
degree ≤ nk in the coeﬃcients of the matrix.

8.7. Applications of model sets

183

Remark 8.44. The formula of Proposition 8.40 could be used to compute numerically
the mean rate of injectivity in time k of a sequence of matrices: it is much faster to
compute the area of a ﬁnite number of intersections of cubes (in fact, a small number)
than to compute the cardinalities of the images of a big set [−R, R]n × Zn.
Proof of Proposition 8.40. We want to determine the density of Γk. By Equation (8.7), we
have

But if x = p2(λ), then we can write λ = ((cid:101)λ,0n) + (0(k−1)n,−x, x) with(cid:101)λ ∈(cid:101)Λk. Thus,

x ∈ Γk ⇐⇒ x ∈ Zn and ∃λ ∈ Λk : x = p2(λ), p1(λ) ∈ Wk.
x ∈ Γk ⇐⇒ x ∈ Zn and ∃(cid:101)λ ∈(cid:101)Λk : (0(k−1)n,−x)−(cid:101)λ ∈ Wk

⇐⇒ x ∈ Zn and (0(k−1)n, x) ∈ (cid:91)
(cid:101)λ∈(cid:101)Λk
Thus, x ∈ Γk if and only if the projection of (0(k−1)n, x) on Rnk/(cid:101)Λk belongs to(cid:83)(cid:101)λ∈(cid:101)Λk
(0(k−1)n, x), with x ∈ Zn, are equidistributed in Rnk/(cid:101)Λk.
To prove this equidistribution, we compute the inverse matrix of (cid:101)MA1,··· ,Ak:

Wk. Then, the proposition follows directly from the fact that the points of the form

tion to the ﬁrst coordinate) when the sequence of matrices is generic.

As in the case of the time 1 (Proposition 8.12), there is also a geometric method to

compute the frequency of a diﬀerence in Γk.
Proposition 8.45. For a generic sequence of matrices (Ak)k, we have

and obtain the following formula (which is a generalization of Proposition 8.18).

Proposition 8.46. For a generic sequence of matrices (Ak)k, we have

Dd(Γk) =

B1/2

dLeb(λ).

The proof of this proposition is similar to that of Proposition 8.18 page 168 (see in

particular Lemma 8.19).

Recall the problem raised by Theorem 8.24: we want to make τk as small as possi-
ble. By an argument of equidistribution, generically, it is equivalent to make the mean
rate of injectivity τk as small as possible when k goes to inﬁnity, by perturbing every
matrix in SLn(R) of at most δ > 0 (ﬁxed once for all). In the framework of model sets,
Theorem 8.24 is motivated by the phenomenon of concentration of the measure on a
neighbourhood of the boundary of the cubes in high dimension.
Proposition 8.47. Let Wk be the inﬁnite ball of radius 1/2 in Rk and vk the vector (1,··· ,1) ∈
Wk∩
Rk. Then, for every ε, δ > 0, there exists k0 ∈ N∗
(Wk + δvk)

such that for every k ≥ k0, we have Leb

< ε.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Applying Hajós theorem (Theorem 8.21), it is easy to see when the density of Γk is
equal to 1: combining this theorem with Proposition 8.40, we obtain that this occurs
if and only if the lattice given by the matrix MA1,··· ,Ak satisﬁes the conclusions of Hajós
theorem 9. The heuristic suggested by the phenomenon of concentration of the measure

9. Of course, this property can be obtained directly by saying that the density is equal to 1 if and only

if the rate of injectivity of every matrix of the sequence is equal to 1.

8.7. Applications of model sets

185

is that if we perturb “randomly” any sequence of matrices, we will go “far away” from
the lattices satisfying Hajós theorem and then the rate of injectivity will be close to 0.
Remark 8.48. The kind of questions addressed by Hajós theorem are in general quite
delicate. For example, we can wonder what happens if we do not suppose that the
centres of the cubes form a lattice of Rn. O. H. Keller conjectured in [Kel30] that the
conclusion of Hajós theorem is still true under this weaker hypothesis. This conjecture
was proven to be true for n ≤ 6 by O. Perron in [Per40a, Per40b], but remained open in
higher dimension until 1992, when J. C. Lagarias and P. W. Shor proved in [LS92] that
Keller’s conjecture is false for n ≥ 10 (this result was later improved by [Mac02] which
shows that it is false as soon as n ≥ 8; the case n = 7 is still open).

8.7.2 New proof that the asymptotic rate of injectivity is generically

smaller than 1/2

As a ﬁrst application of the concept of model set, we give a new proof of the fact that
rate of injectivity of a generic sequence of SLn(R) is smaller than 1/2. To begin with, we
give a lemma estimating the sizes of intersections of cubes when the rate is bigger than
1/2 (which is the geometric counterpart of Lemma 8.29).
Lemma 8.49. Let Wk =] − 1/2,1/2]k and Λ ⊂ Rk be a lattice with covolume 1 such that
(cid:16)
Dc(Wk + Λ) ≥ 1/2. Then, for every v ∈ Rk, we have
(Wk + Λ + v)∩ (Wk + Λ)

(cid:17) ≥ 2Dc(Wk + Λ)− 1.

Dc

Proof of Lemma 8.49. We ﬁrst remark that Dc(Λ + Wk) is equal to the volume of the pro-
jection of Wk on the quotient space Rk/Λ. For every v ∈ Rk, the projection of Wk + v on
Rk/Λ has the same volume; as this volume is greater than 1/2, and as the covolume of
Λ is 1, the projections of Wk and Wk + v overlap, and the volume of the intersection is
bigger than 2Dc(Wk + Λ)− 1. Returning to the whole space Rk, we get the conclusion of
the lemma.
Remark 8.50. In the case where Λ is the lattice spanned by MA1,··· ,Ak, where A1,··· , Ak is a

generic family, Lemma 8.49 can be deduced directly from Lemma 8.29 (more precisely,
improves its conclusion of a factor 2).

This lemma allows us to give another proof of Theorem 8.30 (page 173), which im-
plies in particular that the asymptotic rate of injectivity of a generic sequence of ma-
trices of SLn(R) is smaller than 1/2 (and even is smaller than a sequence converging
exponentially fast to 1/2).
Alternative proof of Theorem 8.30. Let (Ak)k≥1 be a bounded sequence of matrices of
. Let(cid:101)Λk be the lattice spanned
by the matrix (cid:101)MB1,··· ,Bk (deﬁned by Equation (8.6) page 181) and Wk =] − 1/2,1/2]nk be

Unfortunately, if the density of Wk +(cid:101)Λk – which is generically equal to the density

Remark that with this strategy, we do not need to make “clever” perturbations of the
matrices: provided that the coeﬃcients of the matrices are rationally independent, the
perturbation of each matrix is made independently from that of the others. However,
this reasoning does not tell when exactly the rate of injectivity decreases (likely, in most
of cases, the speed of decreasing of the rate of injectivity is much faster than the one
obtained by this method), and does not say either where exactly the loss of injectivity
occurs in the image sets.

The following lemma is a generalization of Lemma 8.49. It expresses that if the den-

sity of Wk +(cid:101)Λk is bigger than 1/(cid:96), then there can not be more than (cid:96) disjoint translates
of Wk +(cid:101)Λk, and gives an estimation on the size of these intersections.
Lemma 8.51. Let Wk =] − 1/2,1/2]k and Λ ⊂ Rk be a lattice with covolume 1 such that
(cid:48) ∈ (cid:126)1, (cid:96)(cid:127) such
Dc(Wk + Λ) ≥ 1/(cid:96). Then, for every collection v1,··· , v(cid:96) ∈ Rk, there exists i (cid:44) i

(cid:96)Dc(Wk + Λ)− 1

(cid:96)((cid:96) − 1)

.

Proof of Lemma 8.51. For every v ∈ Rk, the density Dc(Wk + Λ+v) is equal to the volume
of the projection of Wk on the quotient space Rk/Λ. As this volume is greater than
1/(cid:96), and as the covolume of Λ is 1, the projections of the sets (Wk + vi)1≤i≤(cid:96) on Rk/Λ
overlap, and the volume of the points belonging to at least two diﬀerent sets is bigger
than (cid:96)Dc(Wk + Λ) − 1. As there are (cid:96)((cid:96) − 1)/2 possibilities of intersection, there exists
i (cid:44) i
such that the volume of the intersection between the projections of Wk + vi and
(cid:48) is bigger than 2((cid:96)Dc(Wk + Λ)−1)/((cid:96)((cid:96)−1)). Returning to the whole space Rk, we

In a certain sense, conclusion (1) corresponds to an hyperbolic case, and conclusion

(2) expresses that there is a diﬀusion between times k and k + 1.
Proof of Lemma 8.52. Let Oε be the set of the matrices B ∈ SLn(R) satisfying: for any
collection of vectors w1,··· , w(cid:96)−1 ∈ Rn, there exists a set U ⊂ Rn/BZn of measure > ε such
that every point of U belongs to at least (cid:96) diﬀerent cubes of the collection (Bv + wi +
W1)v∈Zn,1≤i≤(cid:96)−1. In other words 11, every x ∈ Rn whose projection x on Rn/BZn belongs
to U satisﬁes

(cid:96)−1(cid:88)

(cid:88)

v∈Zn

i=1

1x∈Bv+wi+W1 ≥ (cid:96).

(8.11)

We easily see that the sets Oε are open and that the union of these sets over ε > 0 is dense
(it contains the set of matrices B whose entries are all irrational). Thus, if we are given
δ > 0 and M > 0, there exists ε > 0 such that O = Oε is δ-dense in the set of matrices of
SLn(R) whose norm is smaller than M.
We then choose B ∈ O and a collection of vectors w1,··· , w(cid:96)−1 ∈ Rn. Let x ∈ Rn be
such that x ∈ U. By hypothesis on the matrix B, x satisﬁes Equation (8.11), so there
exists (cid:96) + 1 integer vectors v1,··· , v(cid:96) and (cid:96) indices i1,··· , i(cid:96) such that the couples (vj, ij)
are pairwise distinct and that

thickening of the cubes of Wk +(cid:101)Λk is represented in dark blue and the thickening of the
rest of the cubes of Wk+1 +(cid:101)Λk+1 is represented in light blue; we have also represented
another cube of Wk+2 +(cid:101)Λk+2 in yellow. We see that if the projection on the z-axis of the

centre of the yellow cube is smaller than 1, then there is automatically an intersection
between this cube and one of the blue cubes.

We can now prove Theorem 8.24.

Proof of Theorem 8.24. As in the previous proofs of such results, we proceed by induc-

tion on k. Suppose that(cid:101)Λk is such that Dc(Wk +(cid:101)Λk) > 1/(cid:96). Then, Lemma 8.51 ensures
that it is not possible to have (cid:96) disjoint translates of Wk +(cid:101)Λk. Applying Lemma 8.52,
we obtain that either Dc(Wk+1 +(cid:101)Λk+1) < Dc(Wk +(cid:101)Λk), or it is not possible to have (cid:96) − 1
disjoint translates of Wk+1 +(cid:101)Λk+1. And so on, applying Lemma 8.52 at most (cid:96)− 1 times,

(cid:48) has additional auto-intersections.

Chapter 8. Rate of injectivity of linear maps
We now prove the estimation of Equation (8.10). Suppose that τk ∈ [1/((cid:96) − 2),1/((cid:96) −
1)], we compute how long it takes for the rate to be smaller than 1/((cid:96) − 1). We apply

Thus, when (cid:96) is large enough, the time it takes for the rate to decrease from 1/((cid:96) − 2) to

1/((cid:96) − 1). As a consequence, τ(k) = o(f (k)).
Remark 8.54. Fix a probability measure µ on SLn(R) whose support has nonempty inte-
rior. Then, for almost every sequence of independent µ-identically distributed matrices,
the asymptotic rate of injectivity is zero. This is an easy consequence of the fact that the
(open and δ-dense) set O in Lemma 8.52 is independent from the matrices A1,··· , Ak,
from the 0-1 law and from the continuity of the rate of injectivity on a full Lebesgue
measure set.

Statistics of roundoff errors

In this (very) short chapter, we use the formalism of model sets to study the statistics
of the errors made when we compute the images of a point of Zn by the discretizations
of a generic sequence of linear maps. Here, the main result is that when we consider
all the points of Zn, the roundoﬀ errors made at each iteration are equidistributed in
[−1/2,1/2]n (Proposition 9.1). This result had already been obtained by P.P. Flocker-
mann in [Flo02, Theorem 10 page 44] in dimension 1 (see Proposition 9.2), with quite
diﬀerent techniques. From this result, we deduce the statistics of the cumulative errors
made after k iterations. In particular, in dimension n = 1, it allows us to compute the
discrepancy (see Deﬁnition 9.3) between the appropriate uniform measure on R and the
image sets (Proposition 9.4).

Ultimately, we hope that these notions can be used to tackle a conjecture of O.E.
Lanford (Conjecture 12.13) concerning the physical measures of expanding maps of
the circle.

Introduction

In this third part of the manuscript, we will study the dynamics of the discretiza-
tions of generic Cr-maps, namely both conservative and dissipative diﬀeomorphisms,
and expanding maps. We conducted this study for several reasons.

First of all, it is commonly accepted that the generic C1 dynamics represents some
physical systems better than the C0 generic dynamics: a lot of these concrete systems
are smooth, and the generic C0 dynamics contains “wild” behaviours (for example, for
both generic conservative and dissipative homeomorphisms, whether the set of periodic
points of a given period is empty, whether it forms a Cantor set, thus it is uncountable).
Moreover, in the C1 generic case, a wider class of behaviours can occur, as there are
“generic dichotomy theorems” (see for example [ACW14]).

Furthermore, some aspects of the behaviour of the discretizations of generic conser-
vative homeomorphisms are a bit disappointing. The combinatorics of the discretiza-
tions varies a lot depending on the order of discretization, and does not tell anything
about the actual dynamics of the continuous system. In addition, nothing in the results
we have proved in the ﬁrst part gives a method to to detect the “physical” behaviour of
the homeomorphism on the discretizations. We would like to know if in the C1 case, it
is possible to obtain a method to recover the physical measures from some dynamical
features of the discretizations.

In this part, we will consider a compact boundaryless manifold X of dimension n ≥ 2
(we will also study the speciﬁc case of the circle), equipped with a measure λ derived
froma volume form. We will use the following notations.
Notation 9.5. We denote by Diﬀ1(X) the set of C1-diﬀeomorphisms of X, endowed by
the metric dC1 deﬁned by:

(cid:16)

+ sup

We denote by Diﬀ1(X, λ) the subset of Diﬀ1(X) made of the diﬀeomorphisms that pre-
serve the measure λ, endowed with the same metric dC1.

The metric dC1 on Diﬀ1(X) and Diﬀ1(X, λ) makes them Baire spaces. In this intro-
duction, we will state all the results for the phase space X = Tn, the measure λ = Leb
and the uniform grids

Introduction

The ﬁrst chapter of this part will be devoted to the direct application of classical

perturbation lemmas for C1-diﬀeomorphisms.

These perturbations lemmas are in general much more diﬃcult to obtain than in
the case of homeomorphisms (proposition of ﬁnite maps extension, see Proposition 3.3):
when we perturb a diﬀeomorphism, we have to take care of the norm of the diﬀerentials
of the perturbation. This is a crucial diﬀerence. Indeed, in the C0 case, if we want to
perturb the image of a point of ε, we only have to make a perturbation on a ball of size
ε. If we want to do the same in topology C1, the support of the perturbation has to
contain a ball whose size is way bigger than ε. Thus, for homeomorphisms, and for N
large enough, we are able to move independently each point of a grid EN, while for C1
diﬀeomorphisms we are only authorized to move a small proportion 1 of the points of
EN.

Thus, if the C1 generic dynamics is mainly considered as more interesting than the
C0 dynamics, the price to pay is that our results are in general weaker: they only concern
a small proportion of the points of the grids. Note that the case of the regularity C1 is
somehow the “limit case”: to our knowledge, there is no general statement of interesting
perturbation result in regularity Cr, with r > 1.

As a consequence, the results we obtain in this chapter – by applying directly clas-
sical perturbation lemmas – only concern a sub-dynamics of the discretizations. More
precisely, in Part 1, we were able to determine the dynamics of all the points of the dis-
cretizations of generic conservative homeomorphisms. Here, we will only control the
dynamics of a few points of the grid. For example, even if the dynamical property we
are interested in concern a ε-dense subset of X, it may happen that the mesh of the grids
which satisﬁes the conclusions of the theorems is very small compared to ε; in this case
we only know the dynamics (for the discretizations) of a small proportion of points of
these grids.

The results of this ﬁrst chapter of Part 3 will be based on the following statement

(Corollary 10.2).
Proposition S. Let f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn) (or f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb)) be a generic diﬀeomorphism. Then,
for every τ ∈ N, every N0 ∈ N and every ε > 0, there exists N ≥ N0 such that every periodic
orbit of f of period smaller than τ is ε-shadowed by a periodic orbit of fN with the same
period.

This proposition states that every periodic orbit of a generic diﬀeomorphism is de-
tected by an inﬁnite number of discretizations. It will also allow us to deduce a lot
of results about the dynamics of the discretizations of generic diﬀeomorphisms by ap-
plying classical perturbation lemmas. For example, applying the connecting lemma of
C. Bonatti and S. Crovisier, [BC04], we get the following result (Corollary 10.4).
Proposition T. Let f be a generic diﬀeomorphism of Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb). Then, for any ε > 0 and
any N0 > 0, there exists N ≥ N0 such that fN has a periodic orbit which is ε-dense.

The statement is still true in the dissipative generic case if we restrict to a maximal in-

variant chain-transitive set.

This statement can be seen as a weak version of Corollary 5.9, which states that for a
generic conservative homeomorphism, there exists an inﬁnite number of discretizations

1. This proportion is asymptotically independent from the order N of the discretization, and depends

on the size of the C1 perturbation.

205

which are cyclic permutations of the grids. We can also apply an ergodic closing lemma
(due to R. Mañé [Mañ82] and F. Abdenur, C. Bonatti and S. Crovisier [ABC11]); we then
get the following result for discretizations (Corollary 10.9).
Proposition U. Let f be a generic diﬀeomorphism of Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb). Then, for any f -
invariant measure µ, any ε > 0 and any N0 > 0, there exists N ≥ N0 such that fN supports a
periodic measure which is ε-close to µ.

The statement is still true in the dissipative generic case for every measure µ supported by

a maximal invariant chain-transitive set.

Again, this result can be seen as a weak version of Theorem 5.51 for homeomor-

phisms.

following heuristic.

Finally, we can say that all these results of Chapter 10 go in the direction of the
For a generic diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), each “sub-dynamics” of f (periodic
orbits, chain-transitive invariant compact sets, invariant measure, rotation set. . . ) can be
detected by some discretizations fN. However, we have no control over the orders of dis-
cretization N for which it is true, and no control over the global dynamics of fN. In the
dissipative case, the same holds on each chain-recurrent class of f .

Remark that for diﬀeomorphisms, the behaviours in the dissipative case are quite
close to those in the conservative case, which was not true for generic homeomorphisms.
Indeed, for a generic dissipative homeomorphism, the chain recurrent classes are totally
disconnected, while for generic dissipative diﬀeomorphisms they can contain nonempty
open sets (for example, there are open sets of transitive Anosov diﬀeomorphisms). On
each of these chain recurrent classes, the dynamics generically resembles to that of a
conservative diﬀeomorphism.

Recall that the class of C1-diﬀeomorphisms bears open sets of Anosov maps. One
of the important properties of such systems is that they satisfy the shadowing lemma:
if f is Anosov, then for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that every δ-pseudo-orbit
of f is ε-shadowed by a true orbit of f . As orbits of discretizations are in particular
pseudo-orbits, orbits of discretizations of Anosov maps are shadowed by real orbits of
the initial map. However, we do not control the dynamics of the shadowing orbit: for
example, if the Anosov map is ergodic, we can not impose to the shadowing orbit to
be typical with respect to Lebesgue measure. This phenomenon could seem anecdotic,
but its consequences are in fact quite bad. Recall, for example, the behaviour of the
discretizations of the linear automorphisms of the torus on the canonical grids (see
Figure 1.1): in this case, the discretizations are permutations with a very small global
period; thus the dynamics of the discretizations does not reﬂect the mixing properties
of the initial dynamics. Thus, we can say that the shadowing lemma does not imply
that the dynamics of fN looks like that of f .

In a certain sense, the statements we prove in this ﬁrst chapter express that for
a generic diﬀeomorphism f , any dynamical behaviour of f is shadowed by a similar
dynamical behaviour of the discretizations of f . More precisely, by a sub-dynamics
of the discretizations; the dynamics of the rest of the grid is not totally random, as
by the shadowing lemma it is close to some dynamics of the initial system. The bad
news is that in the theorems we prove, we have no explicit control on the orders of
discretization for which we detect this or that dynamical feature of f , whereas in the
shadowing lemma the dependence of the parameter δ to ε is explicit.

Introduction

The second chapter of this part is devoted to the study of the degree of recurrence
of a generic C1-diﬀeomorphism, in both conservative and dissipative cases, and of a
generic expanding map.

Indeed, in Chapter 10, we do not say anything about the global dynamics of the
discretizations; we obtain results about sub-dynamics of the discretizations. In Chap-
ter 11, we will study the simplest global combinatorial quantity for the discretizations:
the degree of recurrence. We say that this invariant is the simplest to study because it
is obtained as a decreasing limit in time. Thus, the study of the degree of recurrence
reduces to that of ﬁnite time quantities. This study will also be the occasion to observe
that the local behaviour of the discretizations in small time is governed by the behaviour
of the diﬀerentials of the diﬀeomorphism; in particular we will use crucially the study
of the discretizations of linear maps we have conducted in Part 2 of this manuscript.

Recall that the degree of recurrence D(fN) of a homeomorphism f is deﬁned as the
ratio between the cardinality of the recurrent set of the discretization fN and that of the
grid EN (Deﬁnition 11.1). This degree of recurrence somehow represents the amount
of information we lose when we iterate the discretization. The study of the degree of
recurrence of a generic diﬀeomorphism easily reduces to that of the rates of injectivity
(see Deﬁnition 11.2)

do that, we deﬁne the discretization of a linear map A : Rn → Rn as the map(cid:98)A = π ◦ A :
We ﬁrst show a local-global formula for this rate of injectivity: the rate of injectivity
of a generic diﬀeomorphism is linked with the rates of injectivity of its diﬀerentials. To
Zn → Zn, where π : Rn → Zn is a projection on (one of) the nearest integer point for
the euclidean distance (see Deﬁnition 7.11). Then, the rate of injectivity of a sequence
(Ak)k≥0 of matrices is deﬁned as (see Deﬁnition 7.19)

The local-global formula is the following (Theorem 11.8, see also Theorem 11.11).
Theorem V. Let r ≥ 1 and f ∈ Diﬀr(Tn) (or f ∈ Diﬀr(Tn,Leb)) be a generic diﬀeomorphism.
Then τt(f ) is well deﬁned (that is, the limit exists) and satisﬁes:

τt(f ) =

Moreover, the function τt is continuous in f .

Remark that the hypothesis of genericity is necessary to get this theorem (see Exam-
ple 11.4). The proof of this result involves the local linearization of a diﬀeomorphism
(Lemma 11.5), which is a diﬃcult result in the conservative case (it uses the smoothing
of a conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism of A. Avila, see [Avi10]). It also uses crucially the
study of the continuity of the rate we have conducted in Part 2 of this manuscript.

In the last section of Chapter 11, we give a variation of Theorem V for expanding
maps. This statement links the rate of injectivity of a generic Cr-expanding map with
the probability of percolation D of a random graph associated to the derivatives of this
map (Theorem 11.16).

The techniques developed to prove this statement also lead to the proof of Theo-
rem V in the Cr regularity, for every r ≥ 1. Notice that even if theorem V is true for
generic Cr-diﬀeomorphisms for every r ≥ 1, it is not suﬃcient to get that the degree of
recurrence is generically equal to 0 in the Cr topology: to prove Theorem X, we need to
perturb the derivative of a diﬀeomorphism on a big subset of Tn. However, there is a
hope that in the case of expanding maps, Theorem W leads to the fact that the degree
of recurrence is generically equal to 0 in any topology of Cr convergence.

The behaviour described by Theorem V is very diﬀerent from the C0 case.
(cid:17)
For a generic dissipative homeomorphism f , we have τ1(f ) = 0 (Corollary 4.14),
while for a generic conservative homeomorphism f , for every t > 0, the quantity
/ Card(EN) accumulates on both 0 and 1 when N goes to +∞ (Corol-
Card
laries 5.9 and 5.20). The behaviour for generic diﬀeomorphisms does not depend on
the assumption of preservation of a measure or not, and is in a certain sense smoother.

(fN)t(EN)

(cid:16)

In short, the rate of injectivity of a diﬀeomorphism can be computed by integrating
the rates of injectivity of its diﬀerentials. This allows us to use the study of the rate of
injectivity of linear maps we have conducted in the second part of this thesis, and in
particular Theorem 8.24. Applying classical techniques of C1 dynamics (in particular
Rokhlin tower lemma), the application of this theorem is quite straightforward and
leads to the following theorem.
Theorem X. For a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), we have

t→∞ τt(f ) = 0.
lim
This implies in particular that limN→+∞ D(fN) = 0.

This theorem must be compared with the case of homeomorphisms (see Corol-
lary 5.24): for a generic conservative homeomorphism f , the sequence D(fN) accumu-
lates on the whole segment [0,1]. Thus, in the case of diﬀeomorphisms, the behaviour
of the rate of injectivity is less irregular than for homeomorphisms; despite this, the
theorem shows that when we iterate the discretizations of a generic conservative dif-
feomorphism, we lose a great amount of information. Moreover, although f is conser-
vative, its discretizations tend to behave like dissipative maps. This can be compared
with the work of P. Lax [Lax71]: for any conservative homeomorphism f , there is a bi-
jective ﬁnite map arbitrarily close to f (see Theorem 5.5). The previous theorem states
that for a generic conservative C1 diﬀeomorphism, the discretizations never possess this
property.

To summarize, for a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism, the recurrent sets
Ω(fN) are such that their limit superior is Tn (see Proposition T), and their cardinal-
ity behaves as o(Card(EN)).
The same behaviour of the rate of injectivity holds in the generic dissipative case
(Corollary 11.24): for a generic dissipative diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn), we have

208

Introduction

limN→+∞ D(fN) = 0. This result is an easy consequence of a theorem of A. Avila and
J. Bochi (Theorem 11.22, see also [AB06]).

Finally, in Chapter 12, we tackle the question of the physical behaviour of the dis-
fNk
cretizations. In section 12.1, we study the measures µ
for “a lot” of points x. Recall
x
that for every x, the orbit of xN under fN falls in a periodic orbit of fN; we denote by
fNk
the uniform measure on this periodic orbit. In the third chapter of this part, we
µ
x
will prove the following statement (Theorem 12.1).
Theorem Y. For a generic diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), for a generic point x ∈ X, and
for any f -invariant probability measure µ, there exists a subsequence (Nk)k of discretizations
such that

fNk

−→
k→+∞ µ.

Again, the study of the linear case (more precisely, Lemma 8.55) plays a pivotal
role in the proof of this theorem. It also uses an ergodic closing lemma adapted from
[ABC11] (Lemma 12.6), and the connecting lemma for pseudo-orbits of [BC04] (see also
Theorem 10.3).

Recall that in the case of homeomorphisms, we have proved that for a generic con-
servative homeomorphism f , and for any f -invariant measure µ, there exists a sub-
−→
sequence (fNk)k of discretizations such that for every x ∈ Tn, we have µ
k→+∞ µ. The
result we have for diﬀeomorphisms – even if it is much more diﬃcult to prove – is much
weaker: it not only concerns the behaviour of a generic subset of the torus instead of all
the points, but the orders of discretization for which the conclusions of the theorem are
true strongly depend on the point x.

fNk
x

Despite this, this theorem says that in practice, we must be very careful when we
want to ﬁnd a physical measure. Suppose that we want to ﬁnd the unique physical
measure µ0 of a generic C1-diﬀeomorphism f . We could think that it is suﬃcient to
compute the measures µf
x for a certain number of points x; since µ0 is the unique phys-
ical measure, µf
x should be close to µ0 for most of the points x. In practice, of course,
we will consider a ﬁnite number of such points x, and we will compute with a given
precision, that is we will iterate a discretization fN. The result says that for some N, we
fNk
observe a measure µ
x
Note that Theorem Y does not say anything about the measures µfN
Tn. Recall that these
measures are deﬁned as the average over x ∈ EN of the measures µfN
Tn is
supported by the union of periodic orbits of fN, and the total measure of each of these
periodic orbits is proportional to the size of its basin of attraction under fN. For now,
Tn for generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphisms
the theoretical study of the measures µfN
seems quite hard, as this kind of questions is closely related to the still open problem of
genericity of ergodicity among these maps (see [ACW14] for the most recent advances
on this topic).

that has nothing to do with the physical measure µ0.

x ; equivalently µfN

On numerical simulations of these measures µfN

Tn, it is not clear whether they con-
verge towards Lebesgue measure or not (see Figures 12.15, 12.16 and 12.17). However,
one can hope that their behaviour is not as erratic as for generic conservative home-
omorphisms, where they accumulate on the whole set of f -invariant measures (The-
orem 5.51). Indeed, Theorem X shows that the degree of recurrence D(fN) converges

209
to 0 as N tends to +∞ for a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism, while it accu-
mulates on the whole segment [0,1] for generic conservative homeomorphisms (Corol-
lary 5.24). This shows that the global dynamics of discretizations of generic conservative
C1-diﬀeomorphism and homeomorphisms might be very diﬀerent.

Section 12.2 is devoted to the study of the measures (f

∗
N)mλN for “small” times m
(recall that λN is the uniform measure on the grid EN), in the case where f is a C1+α
expanding map of the circle. In this setting, a classical result asserts that f has a single
physical measure µ0, which coincides with the SRB measure of f , and is also the unique
invariant probability measure with a Cα density (see Theorem 12.17). Our theorem
∗
N)mλN converge to
asserts that if N goes to inﬁnity much faster than m, the measures (f
µ0 (Theorem 12.15).
Theorem Z. For every 0 < α ≤ 1 and every C1+α expanding map f ∈ E 1+α
(S1), there exists
a constant c0 = c0(f ) > 0 such that if (Nm)m is a sequence of integers going to inﬁnity and
satisfying log Nm > c0m, then the convergence (f

d

∗

)m(λNm) → µ0 holds.

This result answers partially to a conjecture of O.E. Lanford (see Conjecture 12.13).
Its proof consists in a calculus of the diﬀerence of action on measures between the
Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius operator and the pushforwards by the discretization f

∗
N.

In Section 12.3, we ﬁrst present numerical experiments simulating the measures µfN
x
T2 for some examples of conservative C1-diﬀeomorphisms of the torus. The results
and µfN
of these simulations are quite striking: for all the diﬀeomorphisms we have tested (even
a diﬀeomorphism C1-close to a linear Anosov map, thus C0 conjugated to it), for some
large orders of discretization N, the measures µfN
x do not look like Lebesgue measure
(see for instance Figures 12.7, 12.8 and 12.9). Thus, in practice, we have to be very
careful when we compute numerically some measures µfN
x,T, it may happen that they do
not reﬂect the physical behaviour of the initial diﬀeomorphism at all.

The end of this section is devoted to numerical simulations of invariant measures
of expanding maps; in particular we observe on Figure 12.18 that as predicted by The-
)m(λNm)) is very close to 0 for small values of m, but
orem Z, the distance dist(µ0,(f
then increases with m to a signiﬁcant value.

To summarize, we take stock about what we have proved to answer the question: is
is possible to observe physical measures on discretizations? In practice, this question
can be formalized in many ways 2.

– First, we can wonder if the measures µfN
tend to a physical measure of f for
x
“many” points x. The answer is no, when by “many points x” we mean “generic
points x ∈ X”, for generic conservative and dissipative C1-diﬀeomorphisms (The-
orems 12.1 and 12.3) and generic expanding maps (Proposition 12.4). The be-
haviours described by these statements can even be observed in practice (see Sec-
tion 12.3) However, we do not know what happens when we consider a set of
points x which is typical for Lebesgue measure.
– Second, we can ask whether the measures 3 µfN

X converge to a physical measure
of f or not. We have no theoretical statement about this question, even for ex-
2. Here, we consider only the case of the regularity Cr, r ≥ 1; the case of homeomorphisms has been

treated in Part 1.

panding maps of the circle. Moreover, the results of numerical simulations are
not clear, as they suggest that the answer to this question could be “yes, if we
consider averages among a wide range of orders N” (see Figures 12.21 and 12.22).
– As we do not understand the behaviours of the measures 4 µfN
X , as suggested by

N)mλN converge
O.E. Lanford (see Conjecture 12.13), we can ask if the measures (f

and for a Cα expanding map on the circle: in this case, the measures (f
converge exponentially fast to the unique physical measure of the map. For now,
we do not know what happens for bigger times m. The numerical experiments

N)mλN: for a ﬁxed order
suggest a quite surprising evolution of the measures (f
of discretization N, these measures converge very fast towards the SRB measure,
and then moves away from it slowly. This phenomenon is maybe due to the fact
that the numerical errors due to the discretization process are equidistributed (see
Proposition 9.4; this phenomenon could be speciﬁc to the dimension 1).

– Finally, we can investigate whether the two ﬁrst questions are connected or not.
More precisely, we wonder if there exits a discrete Birkhoﬀ’s theorem, which
would state that if the measures µfN
X converge to a measure µ, then the measures
µfN
x tend to µ for “a lot” of points x (in a sense to deﬁne).

Applications of perturbation lemmas

In this chapter, we apply classical perturbation lemmas of C1-diﬀeomorphisms to
deduce statements about the dynamics of the discretizations of C1 generic conservative
and dissipative diﬀeomorphisms.

In this chapter, X will be a smooth compact boundaryless Riemannian manifold
of dimension n ≥ 2.
It will be equipped with a measure λ, derived from a volume
form (independent from the metric on X). We will be interested in the dynamics of
the discretizations of generic C1-diﬀeomorphisms, in both dissipative and conservative
cases; i.e. generic elements of Diﬀ1(X) and Diﬀ1(X, λ).

We will also ﬁx a sequence (EN)N≥0 of discretizations grids on X. Recall that the very
deﬁnition of discretization grid (Deﬁnition 3.5) supposes that the mesh of these discrete
sets tends to 0, that is: for every ε > 0, there exists N0 such that for every N ≥ N0, the
grid EN is ε-dense in X. In this chapter, this is the only assumption we will make on
the grids. Given a diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ(X, λ), we denote by fN the discretization of
f with respect to the grid EN.

We will begin this chapter by stating that the periodic orbits of a generic diﬀeomor-
phism are shadowed by periodic orbits of its discretizations (Corollary 10.2). This will
allow us to apply classical closing lemmas, which state that some dynamical invariants
of a generic diﬀeomorphism are shadowed by periodic orbits.
We ﬁrst apply the connecting lemma for pseudo-orbits of C. Bonatti and S. Crovisier
[BC04], to prove that for a generic diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) and for every ε > 0, an
inﬁnite number of discretizations fN have a periodic orbit which is ε-dense in X (Corol-
lary 10.4). We also apply a closing lemma of F. Abdenur and S. Crovisier [AC12] to
obtain that an inﬁnite number of discretizations fN are “ε-topologically mixing” (Corol-
lary 10.7). The same results holds in the dissipative case for every chain-recurrent class.
We then apply an ergodic closing lemma of R. Mañé [Mañ82] and F. Abdenur,
C. Bonatti and S. Crovisier [ABC11] to state that if f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) is a generic conserva-
tive diﬀeomorphism, then every f -invariant measure is shadowed by periodic measures
of the discretizations fN (Corollary 10.9). The same kind of results holds for chain-
transitive invariant compact sets (Corollary 10.11), by applying a connecting lemma
of S. Crovisier [Cro06a]. Again, the same results holds in the dissipative case when
restricted to a chain-recurrent class.

Finally, we will use a theorem of J. Franks [Fra89] of realization of rotation vectors
by periodic points to prove that the rotation set of a generic conservative diﬀeomor-

211

212
Chapter 10. Applications of perturbation lemmas
phism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) is well approximated by rotation sets of discretizations (Proposi-
tion 10.15). The same holds for generic dissipative C1-diﬀeomorphisms, provided that
we take convex hulls of the rotation sets of the discretizations (Proposition 10.16).

First of all, we give the statement of an elementary perturbation lemma that we will
use all along this chapter. This is a C1 counterpart of the proposition of extension of
ﬁnite maps for the C0 topology (Proposition 3.3).
Lemma 10.1 (Elementary perturbation lemma in C1 topology). For every diﬀeomorphism
f ∈ Diﬀ1(X) and every δ > 0, there exists η > 0 and r0 > 0 such that the following property
holds: for every x, y ∈ X such that d(x, y) < r0, there exists a diﬀeomorphism g ∈ Diﬀ1(X)
(cid:16) x+y
satisfying dC1(f , g) < δ, such that g(x) = f (y) and that f and g are equal out of the ball
2 , 1+η
B
Moreover, if f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ), then we can also suppose that g ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ).
Before discussing the consequences of this lemma, let us underline the diﬀerences
with the C0 case. A priori, we will apply the lemma to a small neighbourhood of f ,
thus a small parameter δ > 0. In facts, the number η > 0 tends to +∞ when δ goes to
0; thus the ball B
in which lies the support of the perturbation is large
with respect to the distance between x and y. This phenomenon does not happen in the
C0 topology, where the proposition of extension of ﬁnite maps (Proposition 3.3) states
that the size of the support of the perturbation is almost equal to the distance between
x and y (in fact, it can be supposed to be included in the neighbourhood of a given path
joining x to y). Remark that the situation would be even worse in the Cr topology, for
r > 1: in this case, the Cr size of the perturbation δ > 0 being ﬁxed, the ratio between
the size of the support of the perturbation and d(x, y) would go to inﬁnity when d(x, y)
goes to 0.

Thus, the diﬀerence between the statements we get for homeomorphisms and for
C1-diﬀeomorphisms lies in this diﬀerence between the elementary perturbation lem-
mas: in the C1 case, perturbations are less local than in the C0 case. In the view of ob-
taining generic properties of discretizations, the impossibility of making perturbations
of all the points of the discretization grids has the eﬀect that we can not obtain global
properties of discretizations of generic diﬀeomorphisms with this strategy of proof.

(cid:17)

Sketch of proof of Lemma 10.1. We sketch the proof in the conservative case; the dissipa-
tive case being obtained by the same arguments (and even, by simpler arguments).

The idea of the proof of this lemma is to apply “local rotations”, as in the proof of

the proposition of extension of ﬁnite maps in the C0 topology.

More precisely, in dimension 2, g is obtained by composing f by the time 1 of a
Hamiltonian ﬂow whose orbits are circles with a common centre, such that one of these
circles meets both x and y (see Figure 10.1). As the time 1 of this Hamiltonian maps
x into y, its C0 norm is bigger than d(x, y). But as we also want that the norm of its
diﬀerential is smaller than δ, its support should contain a ball or radius (1 + 1/δ)d(x, y).
This explains why when δ is small, the size of the perturbation has to be big with respect
to d(x, y).

A precise proof can be found for example in [Arn98, Proposition 5.1.1].

From Lemma 10.1, we now deduce another perturbation result which will be at the
basis of the rest of the chapter. It states that every periodic orbit of a generic conserva-
tive diﬀeomorphism is shadowed by periodic orbits of its discretizations.
Corollary 10.2. Let f ∈ Diﬀ1(X) (or f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ)) be a generic diﬀeomorphism. Then, for
every τ ∈ N, every N0 ∈ N and every ε > 0, there exists N ≥ N0 such that every periodic orbit
of f of period smaller than τ is ε-shadowed by a periodic orbit of fN with the same period.

Proof of Corollary 10.2. We prove the corollary in the dissipative case, the conservative
case being identical.
We set Sτ,ε,N the set of f ∈ Diﬀ1(X) such that for every periodic orbit ω of f of period
smaller than τ, there exists a periodic orbit of fN with the same period which is ε-close
to ω. Then, the set of diﬀeomorphisms satisfying the conclusion of the lemma is the set

Thus, it suﬃces to prove that for every τ, ε, N0, the set(cid:83)
Sτ,ε,N contains an open
that d(f , g) < δ and g ∈(cid:83)
Let τ > 0, ε > 0, N0 ∈ N, f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) and δ > 0; we want to ﬁnd g ∈ Diﬀ1(X) such

and dense subset of Diﬀ1(X).

We ﬁrst use a classical result of C. Robinson, which asserts that that for a generic
diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X), the set of periodic points of period smaller than τ is ﬁnite,
and moreover is continuous in the diﬀeomorphism f : if g ∈ Diﬀ1(X) is C1-close to f ,
then its set of periodic points of period smaller than τ is close to that of f for Hausdorﬀ
topology (see [Rob70a, Rob70b], [Rob73], see also [Cro06b]). Thus, perturbing a little
f if necessary, we can suppose that this property actually holds; taking a smaller δ
if necessary, we can also suppose that there is no creation of periodic orbit when we
perturb f into the δ-neighbourhood of f .
So we can enumerate ω1,··· , ω(cid:96) the periodic orbits of f of period smaller than τ. For
each i we denote ωi = {xi,1,··· , xi,τi
}, with f (xi,j) = xi,j+1 (j belonging to Z/τiZ). Using
Lemma 10.1, there exists a radius r1 ∈]0, ε[ (which depends on δ, on the C1-norm of f
and on the minimal distance between two distinct points of the union of these orbits)
such that for every collection of points yi,j satisfying d(yi,j, xi,j) < r1 for every i ∈ (cid:126)1, (cid:96)(cid:127)

214
Chapter 10. Applications of perturbation lemmas
and j ∈ (cid:126)1, τi(cid:127), there exists a diﬀeomorphism g ∈ Diﬀ1(X) such that dC1(f , g) < δ and that
g(yi,j) = yi,j+1.
By the hypothesis on the grids EN, there exists N1 ≥ N0 such that if N ≥ N1, then
EN, and get a diﬀeomorphism g which belongs to the interior of(cid:83)
every ball of radius r1 contains at least one point of EN. We can apply the property
stated in the last paragraph to the discretizations (xi,j)N of the points xi,j on the grid
Sτ,ε,N. This

n≥N0

completes the proof of the lemma.

Corollary 10.2 states that for a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism, any periodic
orbit is shadowed by periodic orbits of the same period of an inﬁnite number of dis-
cretizations. In particular, if we denote by Ord(f ) the set of orders of periodic orbits
of f , for a generic diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) and for any M ∈ N, the supremum
limit over N of [0, M] ∩ Ord(fN) is equal [0, M] ∩ Ord(f ). Moreover, Corollary 10.2 in-
dicates that it is theoretically possible to recover the set of periodic points of a generic
conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism by looking at the corresponding periodic points of its
discretizations (see Figure 5.13 for numerical simulations corresponding to this prop-
erty).

10.2 Discrete counterparts of transitivity and topological

mixing

As a ﬁrst application of Corollary 10.2, we apply the connecting lemma of C. Bonatti

and S. Crovisier [BC04] to get a C1 counterpart of Corollary 5.9.
Theorem 10.3 (Bonatti-Crovisier). A generic diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) is transitive.
More precisely, for any generic diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) and any ε > 0, there exists a
periodic orbit of f which is ε-dense.
In the dissipative case, for a generic diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X), every maximal in-
variant chain-transitive set is transitive. More precisely, for every maximal invariant chain-
transitive set K and every ε > 0, there exists a periodic orbit of f which is ε-dense in K.

In the conservative case, this diﬃcult theorem is somehow a weak answer to the

question asking whether a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism is ergodic or not.

Combining this theorem with Corollary 10.2, we obtain directly the following corol-

lary.
Corollary 10.4. Let f be a generic diﬀeomorphism of Diﬀ1(X, λ). Then, for any ε > 0 and
any N0 > 0, there exists N ≥ N0 such that fN has a periodic orbit which is ε-dense.
Let f be a generic diﬀeomorphism of Diﬀ1(X). Then, for every maximal invariant chain-
transitive set K, for every ε > 0 and every N0 > 0, there exists N ≥ N0 such that fN has a
periodic orbit which is ε-dense in K.

In the conservative case, this corollary expresses that for every ε > 0, an inﬁnite
number of discretizations are “ε-topologically transitive”, thus contain a sub-dynamics
which is similar to that of the initial diﬀeomorphism.

In the dissipative case, it implies that it is possible to recover the chain transitive
set R(f ) of a generic dissipative diﬀeomorphism f , by using the recurrent sets of the
discretizations: R(f ) = limN→+∞Ω(fN).

10.2. Discrete counterparts of transitivity and topological mixing

215

More recently, F. Abdenur and S. Crovisier have obtained in [AC12] a more sophis-
ticated closing lemma, which allows to prove that a generic diﬀeomorphism is topolog-
ically mixing 1.
Theorem 10.5 (Closing lemma with time control, Abdenur-Crovisier). Let f ∈ Diﬀ1(X),
(cid:96) ≥ 2 be an integer, x be either a non-periodic point or a non-resonant periodic point 2.
Assume that each neighbourhood V of x intersects some iterate f m(V) such that m is not a
multiple of (cid:96). Then, there exists diﬀeomorphisms g ∈ Diﬀ1(X), arbitrarily C1-close to f , such
that x is periodic under g whose period is not a multiple of (cid:96).

Moreover, if f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ), then g can be supposed to be conservative too.
This perturbation lemma can be seen as a weak version of Proposition 5.12, which
implies that under the same conditions, but in the C1 topology, the period of x can
be supposed to be coprime with (cid:96). However, combining this lemma with arguments
that are speciﬁc to diﬀeomorphisms, we get a stronger result of genericity, that is that a
generic diﬀeomorphism is topologically strongly mixing.

From this theorem, it is possible to deduce the following statement.

Corollary 10.6. For a generic f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) and for any ε > 0, f has two ε-dense periodic
points, whose periods are not multiples on to the other. The same property holds for a generic
dissipative diﬀeomorphism on every maximal invariant chain-transitive set K.
Proof of Corollary 10.6. Let ε > 0; we show that the set of f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) satisfying the
conclusions of the corollary for ε is open and dense. By the connecting lemma of C. Bon-
atti and S. Crovisier (Theorem 10.3), for a generic f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) and for any ε > 0, f
has a ε-dense periodic point, that we denote by p, whose period is (cid:96); we can further-
more assume that the periodic point p is persistent. Then, by Proposition 2.3 of [AC12],
the map f (cid:96) is transitive on the pointwise homoclinic class 3 of p. Thus, for any neigh-

bourhood V of p, there exists k ∈ N such that f k(cid:96)(cid:16)

(cid:17)∩ V (cid:44) ∅; this allows us to apply

f (V)

Theorem 10.5 to perturb the diﬀeomorphism f to a diﬀeomorphism g. Making both of
the obtained periodic points of g persistent (if necessary), a whole neighbourhood of g
satisﬁes the conclusions of the corollary.

The dissipative case is identical: it suﬃces to apply the dissipative version of Theo-

rem 10.3.

From Corollary 10.6, and using Corollary 10.2, we deduce directly a statement about

discretizations, which is somehow a C1 counterpart of Corollary 5.13.
Corollary 10.7. For a generic f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ), for any ε > 0 and any N0 > 0, there exists
N ≥ N0 such that fN has two ε-dense periodic points, whose periods are not multiples on to
the other. The same property holds for a generic dissipative diﬀeomorphism on every maximal
invariant chain-transitive set K.

Thus, in a certain sense, for every ε > 0, an inﬁnite number of discretizations are

ε-topologically mixing on every maximal invariant chain-transitive set.

X, there exists M ∈ N such that f m(U)∩ V (cid:44) ∅ for every m ≥ M.

10.3 Shadowing of invariant measures

We now come to the ergodic properties of the discretizations of a generic diﬀeomor-
phism. We make use of an ergodic closing lemma, which allows to approximate every
invariant measure by periodic invariant measures
Theorem 10.8 (Mañé, Abdenur-Bonatti-Crovisier). Let f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) be a generic diﬀeo-
morphism. Then, every f -invariant measure µ is the weak limit of periodic measures.
Let f ∈ Diﬀ1(X) be a generic diﬀeomorphism. Then, every f -invariant measure µ which

is supported by an invariant chain-transitive set is the weak limit of periodic measures.

The case where the invariant measure is ergodic has been obtained by R. Mañé
in [Mañ82], the general case has been treated by F. Abdenur, C. Bonatti and S. Cro-
visier in [ABC11, Theorem 3.5] (the theorem also holds for generic conservative C1-
diﬀeomorphisms).

Applying Corollary 10.2, we get the following corollary, which is a C1 counterpart

of Theorems 5.51 and 5.45.
Corollary 10.9. Let f be a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism of Diﬀ1(X, λ). Then, for any
f -invariant measure µ, any ε > 0 and any N0 > 0, there exists N ≥ N0 such that fN supports
a periodic measure which is ε-close to µ.
More generally, for a generic diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ), for any ε > 0 and N0 > 0,
there exists N ≥ N0 such that the set of fN-invariant measures is ε-close to the set of f -
invariant measures (for the Hausdorﬀ distance on the space of compact sets of probability
measures on X).
The statement is still true for a generic dissipative diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X), if the

measure µ is supported by an invariant chain-transitive set.

Roughly speaking, every invariant measure supported by a maximal invariant

chain-transitive set is “seen” by an inﬁnite number of discretizations.

In Chapter 12, we will obtain an improvement of this corollary (Theorem 12.1),
which will describe the basin of attraction of the periodic measure of the discretization.

10.4 Shadowing of chain-transitive invariant sets

We now treat the case of the shadowing of invariant sets of a generic diﬀeomor-
phism. In [Cro06a, Theorem 4], S. Crovisier stated the following result, which asserts
that for a generic diﬀeomorphism, it is possible to recover the chain-transitive invariant
sets by looking only at the periodic points.

Theorem 10.10 (Crovisier). Any chain-transitive compact invariant set of a generic dif-
feomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X) of f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ) is approximated in the Hausdorﬀ topology by
periodic orbits.

Obviously, the converse is always true: any point of accumulation of periodic orbits

is a chain-transitive compact invariant set.

Combined with Corollary 10.2, Theorem 10.10 leads to the following corollary,

which is a C1 counterpart of Theorem 5.47, or Theorem 5.49.
Corollary 10.11. Let f be a generic diﬀeomorphism of Diﬀ1(X) or Diﬀ1(X, λ). Then, for any
f -invariant chain-transitive compact set K, any ε > 0 and any N0 > 0, there exists N ≥ N0

10.5. Rotation sets

217

such that fN has an invariant compact set which is ε-close to K for Hausdorﬀ distance on the
set of compact subsets of X.
More generally, for a generic diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(X) (or f ∈ Diﬀ1(X, λ)), for any
ε > 0 and N0 > 0, there exists N ≥ N0 such that the set of fN-invariant sets is ε-close to the
set of f -invariant chain-transitive compact sets (for Hausdorﬀ distance on the set of compact
sets of compact subsets of X).

10.5 Rotation sets

In this section, we are interested in the approximation of the rotation set of a generic
diﬀeomorphism by the rotation sets of its discretizations (see Chapter 6). Thus, we will
take X = Tn and consider only diﬀeomorphisms in the connected component of the
identity. We also take the same notations as in Chapter 6.

We will see that in the C1-case, applying the elementary perturbation lemma (Corol-
lary 10.2), it is possible to obtain a weaker result about discretized rotation sets (in this
case, we can not control what happens on the whole grid EN, but only on a subgrid
of EN): for a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism, the upper limit of the discretized
rotation sets is equal to the rotation set of the diﬀeomorphism itself.

To begin with, we state an approximation lemma we will use in this section; this

lemma is a quite direct consequence of Lemma 10.1.

Lemma 10.12. If f is generic among Diﬀ1(Tn) or Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), then for every ﬁnite col-
lection of rotation vectors {v1,··· , vn}, each one realized by a periodic orbit of f , there exists a
subsequence fNi of discretizations such that for every i, {v1,··· , vn} ⊂ ρNi (f ).
Proof of Lemma 10.12. The proof of this lemma is very similar to that of Lemma 6.22;
we take the same notations (in particular, Dq ⊂ Q is the set of fractions whose numerator
is smaller than q2 and whose denominator is smaller than q). We prove this lemma in
the conservative setting, the dissipative case being identical.

Consider the set

(10.1)

(cid:41)

To prove the lemma, it suﬃces to prove that this set contains a Gδ dense subset of
Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb).
Let f ∈ Homeo(Tn,Leb), ε > 0, q, N0 ∈ N and D ∈ Dq. We suppose that for all v ∈ D, v
is realizable by a persistent periodic orbit ωi of f . Then, by the elementary perturbation
lemma (Lemma 10.1), it is possible to perturb f into a diﬀeomorphism g such that
dC1(f , g) < ε and that there exists N ≥ N0 such that for every i, there exists a periodic
(cid:48)
orbit ω
i of g which is close to ωi (in particular, it has the same rotation vector) and such
⊂ EN. Moreover, perturbing a little g if necessary (as in the proof of Proposition
(cid:48)
that ω
(cid:48)
i
i are persistent. This proves that the set
6.2), we can suppose that the periodic orbits ω
of (10.1) contains a Gδ dense subset of Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb).

To begin with, we treat the conservative case. We will combine Lemma 10.12 with
a realization theorem of rotation vectors by periodic orbits; but to use this realization
theorem we need to prove that the rotation set of a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism
is nonempty. It is a C1 counterpart of Proposition 6.2.

218

Chapter 10. Applications of perturbation lemmas

Proposition 10.13. On a open dense 4 subset of Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), ρ(F) has non-empty interior.

Remark 10.14. We do not know the shape of the boundary of the rotation set of a generic
conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism. In particular we do not know if it is a polygon or not.
Proof of Proposition 10.13. It suﬃces to resume the proof of Proposition 6.2, and to re-
place the C0 ergodic closing lemma is replaced by the C1-ergodic closing lemma which
is stated in Theorem 10.8. To make the obtained periodic point persistent, we just have
to apply Franks lemma [Fra71] to perturb the diﬀerential of g on the periodic orbit to
avoid having the eigenvalue 1, so that the periodic point becomes persistent (see [KH95,
page 319]). The rest of the proof is identical to the C0 case.

Combined with the realisation theorem of J. Franks (Theorem 6.17, see also [Fra89,
Theorem 3.2]) and the approximation lemma (Lemma 10.12), this proposition directly
implies the following result on the discretizations.
Proposition 10.15. If f is generic among Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), then there exists a subsequence fNi
of discretizations such that ρNi (F) tends to ρ(F) for the Hausdorﬀ topology; in particular, the
asymptotic discretized rotation set tends to the rotation set of f .

In particular, when f is a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism, the asymptotic

discretized rotation set

ρdiscr(F) =

(cid:92)

(cid:91)

M∈N

N≥M

ρ(FN)

coincides with the rotation set.

For a generic C1-diﬀeomorphism, we do not know if the observable rotation set is
reduced to a singleton or not. This is true when the diﬀeomorphism is ergodic, which
is conjectured to be a generic property (see also page 246).

Remark that the behaviour described by Proposition 10.15 can actually be observed

∞
on actual examples of conservative C

-diﬀeomorphisms, see Section 6.4.

The dissipative case is less straightforward, as Proposition 10.13 is false for generic
dissipative C1-diﬀeomorphisms (there are open sets of diﬀeomorphisms whose rotation
set has empty interior). However, the connected component of Id in Diﬀ1(T2), includes
three disjoint open subsets, whose union is dense.
1. The ﬁrst one is the open subset O1 of diﬀeomorphisms f such that ρ(F) has a
nonempty interior (this set is open by the continuity 5 of F (cid:55)→ ρ(F) on every home-
omorphism whose rotation set has nonempty interior, see [LM91]). On O1, the same
arguments than in the conservative case can be applied, thus if f is generic among
O1, then there exists a subsequence fNi of discretizations such that ρNi (F) tends to
ρ(F).

2. The second one is the open subset O2 of diﬀeomorphisms f such that ρ(F) is stably
a segment. By the ergodic closing lemma of R. Mañé (Theorem 10.8), for a generic
f ∈ O2, every rotation vector of an ergodic measure (in particular, the vertices of the
segment) is arbitrarily approximated by a sequence of rotation vectors of (persistent)
periodic points. In particular, on an open and dense subset of O2, the rotation set is
a segment with rational slope, which coincides with the closure of the convex hull of

that if f is generic among O2, then there exists a subsequence

such that conv(ρNi (F)) tends to ρ(F).

3. The third one is the open subset O3 of diﬀeomorphisms f such that ρ(F) is stably
a singleton. Then, as on an open dense subset of Diﬀ1(T2), every diﬀeomorphism
possesses a periodic point, on an open and dense subset of O3, the rotation vector is
realized by a periodic point. Then, trivially, we get that for f belonging to an open
and dense subset of O3, the rotation sets of fN converge globally to the rotation set of
f .
To summarize, we have proved the following property.

there is no need to take convex hulls.

instance) dense subset of the rotation set on which each vector is realized by a periodic point, see for
example [Bég07, Section 3.3]

Degree of recurrence of a generic

diffeomorphism

In this chapter, we begin the study of the the global dynamics of the discretizations
of a generic C1-diﬀeomorphism (both conservative and dissipative) by focusing on the
degree of recurrence of the discretizations.

We will consider that the space phase is the torus Tn, the measure is Lebesgue mea-

sure and the grids are the uniform grids

Let us recall the deﬁnition of the degree of recurrence.

We will see in Section 11.6 that this quite restrictive framework can be generalized to
arbitrary manifolds, provided that the discretizations grids behave locally (and almost
everywhere) like the canonical grids on the torus.
Deﬁnition 11.1. Let E be a ﬁnite set and σ : E → E be a ﬁnite map on E. The recurrent
set of σ is the union Ω(σ) of the periodic orbits of σ; it is also equal to the set σt(E) for
every t large enough.

The degree of recurrence of the ﬁnite map σ is the ratio D(σ) between the cardinality

of the recurrent set and the cardinality of E, that is

(cid:16)

D(σ) =

The goal of this chapter is to study the behaviour of the degree of recurrence D(fN)
as N goes to inﬁnity and for a generic conservative/dissipative diﬀeomorphism. This
degree of recurrence somehow represents the amount of information we lose when we
iterate the discretization.

As it can be obtained as the decreasing limit of ﬁnite time quantities, the degree of
recurrence is maybe the easiest combinatorial invariant to study: we will deduce the
behaviour of the degree of recurrence from that of the rate of injectivity.
Deﬁnition 11.2. Let f ∈ End(Tn) be an endomorphism of the torus and t ∈ N. The rate
of injectivity in time t and for the order N is the quantity

Then, the upper rate of injectivity of f in time t is deﬁned as

The link between the degree of recurrence and the rates of injectivity is made by the

τt(f ) = lim

N→+∞τt

N(f ).

(11.1)

following formula:

D(fN) = lim

t→+∞ τt

N(f ).

The study of the rates of injectivity will be the opportunity to understand the lo-
cal behaviour of the discretizations of diﬀeomorphisms: Theorem 11.8 asserts that that
these rates of injectivity are obtained by averaging the corresponding quantities for
the diﬀerentials of the diﬀeomorphism. The proof of this result involves the local lin-
earization of a diﬀeomorphism (Lemma 11.6), together with estimates of the lack of
continuity of the rate of injectivity in the linear case (Proposition 8.7). We generalize
later this result to the Cr topology, for generic diﬀeomorphisms (Theorem 11.11) and
for generic expanding maps (Theorem 11.16).

In the conservative case, we will use the study of the rate of injectivity of matri-
ces with determinant 1 in Part 2 of this manuscript (see Theorem 8.24). It will lead
to the proof of the fact that the sequence D(fN) of degrees of recurrence of a generic
conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism tends to 0 (Theorem 11.26).

For a generic dissipative C1-diﬀeomorphism, the sequence D(fN) also converges to
0 (Corollary 11.24); it is an easy consequence of a theorem of A. Avila and J. Bochi
(Theorem 11.22, see also [AB06]).

Note that the fact that the local-global formula is true for Cr-generic diﬀeomor-
phisms does not help to conclude about the degree of recurrence of such maps: a priori,
we need to perturs the derivative of such maps on a large subset of the torus. However,
we can hope that Theorem 11.26 remains true for these higher regularities.

We now explain in more detail why the behaviour of D(fN) can be deduced from
N(f )

N(f ))t is decreasing in t, so D(fN) ≤ τt

that of τt. When N is ﬁxed, the sequence (τt
for every t ∈ N. Taking the upper limit in N, we get
N→+∞D(fN) ≤ τt(f )
N→+∞D(fN) ≤ lim

for every t ∈ N, so

lim

lim

t→+∞ τt(f )

(11.2)

(as the sequence (τt(f ))t is decreasing, the limit is well deﬁned). In particular, if we
have an upper bound on limt→+∞ τt(f ), this will give a bound on lim
N→+∞D(fN). Thus, the
proof of Theorem 11.26 is reduced to the study of the quantity limt→+∞ τt(f ).

At the end of this chapter, we recall the results of the simulations we have conducted
about the degree of recurrence of C1-diﬀeomorphisms; it shows that in practice, the
degree of recurrence tends to 0, at least for the examples of diﬀeomorphisms we have
tested.

11.1 Local-global formula

In this section, we state a local-global formula which links the rate of injectivity of
a generic diﬀeomorphism f and the rates of injectivity of its diﬀerentials. The fact that
the map f is C1 – then possesses diﬀerentials – introduces a mesoscopic scale for the
study of the action of the discretizations in small time:

11.1. Local-global formula

223

and we see that the phase space is discrete.

– at the macroscopic scale, the discretization of f acts as f ;
– at the intermediate mesoscopic scale, the discretization of f acts as a linear map;
– at the microscopic scale, we are able to see that the discretization is a ﬁnite map

Recall that the discretization of a linear map A : Rn → Rn is the map(cid:98)A : Zn → Zn
deﬁned by (cid:98)A(x) = π(Ax), where π : Rn → Zn is a projection on (one of) the nearest
The rate of injectivity in time k of the matrices A1,··· , Ak ∈ GLn(R) is then deﬁned as

So, the link between local and global behaviours of the rates of injectivity is given
by the following theorem.
Theorem 11.3. Let f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn) (or f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb)) be a generic diﬀeomorphism. Then
τ1(f ) is well deﬁned (that is, the superior limit is actually a limit) and satisﬁes:

Moreover, the function τ is continuous in f .
Example 11.4. Theorem 11.3 becomes false if we do not suppose that the diﬀeomor-
phism is generic. For example, take a diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), which is equal
to

in a ball of radius r > 0, with a vector v such that v = (0.2/N,−0.1/N) modulo Z2/N, and
“generic” where it does not coincide with this aﬃne map. To construct this example
more rigorously, we can for example apply Lemma 11.6 to have a C1-diﬀeomorphism
which is equal equal to f0 + v in a ball of radius r > 0, and apply the process of proof
of Theorem 11.3 outside of this ball, such that outside of this ball, a formula similar to
Equation L-G holds.

Then, by Lemma 8.2, the rate of injectivity of f0 is equal to 1/2 and that of f0 + v is
equal to 1. Because f is generic anywhere else, both sides of Equation (L-G) are diﬀerent.
Moreover, the rate of injectivity τ1 is not continuous in f .

To show Theorem 11.3, we have to show that Equation (L-G) holds on a dense Gδ set
of diﬀeomorphisms. The “density” part is easily deduced from the following lemma.
Lemma 11.5. Let f1 ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb) (respectively f1 ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn)). Then there exists
f2 ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb) (respectively f2 ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn)) arbitrarily close to f1, and a subset C ∈ Tn
(which is a ﬁnite union of cubes, see Figure 11.1) of measure arbitrarily close to 1, such that
the diﬀerential of f2 is piecewise constant and totally irrational 1 on C .

This lemma follows from the following result of A. Avila, S. Crovisier and A. Wilkin-

son.
Lemma 11.6 (Avila, Crovisier, Wilkinson). Let C be the unit ball of Rn for (cid:107)·(cid:107)∞ and ε > 0.
Then, there exists δ > 0 such that for every g1 ∈ Diﬀ∞
(Rn) such that dC1(g1|C,Id|C) < δ, there
exists g2 ∈ Diﬀ∞

(ii) g2|(1−ε)C = Id|(1−ε)C;
(iii) g2|C(cid:123) = g1|C(cid:123).
Moreover, if g1 preserves Lebesgue measure, then g2 can be chosen to preserve it as well.

The dissipative case of this lemma is easily obtained by interpolating the diﬀeomor-
phism with identity, using a smooth bump function. The proof in the conservative case
is more diﬃcult and involves a result of J. Moser [Mos65]. The reader may refer to
[ACW14, Corollary 6.9] for a complete proof of this lemma 2.

∞
Proof of Lemma 11.5. First of all, we regularize the diﬀeomorphism f1 to get a C
dif-
feomorphism f3 which is close to f1 in the C1 topology. In the dissipative case, this
is easily obtained (for example) by convolving it by an approximation of the identity.
The conservative case is much more diﬃcult; this result has been obtained recently by
A. Avila [Avi10].

We then obtain the lemma by applying Lemma 11.6 to the restriction of f3 on each

cube of a ﬁne enough cubulation of Tn (see Figure 11.1).

The proof of Theorem 11.3 will primarily consist in applying Lemma 11.5 together

with the following lemma.
Lemma 11.7. Let C be a cube of Tn. Then, for every totally irrational matrix A ∈ GLn(R),
every v ∈ Tn and every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for every C1 map f : C → Tn
satisfying supx∈C

(cid:107)Dfx − A(cid:107) ≤ δ, there exists N0 ∈ N such that for every N ≥ N0,

Proof of Theorem 11.3. We perform the proof in the dissipative setting, the conservative
case being identical. Let f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn). The idea is to cut the torus Tn into small pieces
on which f is very close to its Taylor expansion at order 1.

) be the set of diﬀeomorphisms f such that the set of accumula-
tion points of the sequence
is included in the ball of radius 1/(cid:96) and centre
Tn τ1(Dfx) d x (that is, the right side of Equation (L-G)). We want to show that U(cid:96) con-
tains a dense open subset of Diﬀ1(Tn). In other words, we pick a diﬀeomorphism f , an
integer (cid:96) and δ > 0, and we want to ﬁnd another diﬀeomorphism g which is δ-close to
f , and which belongs to the interior of U(cid:96).

To do that, we ﬁrst use Lemma 11.5, which gives a diﬀeomorphism g which is δ-close
to f and whose diﬀerential is piecewise constant and irrational on a ﬁnite union of cubes
C whose measure is bigger than 1− 1/(10(cid:96)). Then by construction, g ∈ U2(cid:96). Indeed, as
the diﬀerentials of g are irrational on C, the rates of injectivity of the translates of the
diﬀerentials are all equal to that of the diﬀerential itself (see Proposition 8.4), thus

Moreover, as the measure of C is bigger than 1− 1/(10(cid:96)), what happens on the comple-
ment of C can be neglected, more precisely,

To show that a whole neighbourhood of g belongs to U(cid:96), it suﬃces to apply
Lemma 11.7 to each cube of C ; as the measure of C is bigger than 1 − /(10(cid:96)) (again,
what happens on C (cid:123) does not count), we get the conclusion of the theorem.

Thus, it remains to prove Lemma 11.7.

Proof of Lemma 11.7. Let A ∈ GLn(R) be a totally irrational matrix. Then, there exists
a parameter δ > 0 and a radius R0 > 0 such that every matrix B ∈ Gln(R) such that
(cid:107)A− B(cid:107) ≤ δ is “almost totally irrational”, so that:

(H1) the rates of injectivity of the translates of B are close one to each other and can be
seen on every ball of radius bigger than R0: there exists R0 > 0 such that for every
R > R0, every B satisfying (cid:107)A− B(cid:107) ≤ δ and every v ∈ Rn, we have

In other words, everything about the rate of injectivity is uniform. The fact that Prop-
erty (H1) is true on an open dense set of matrices is obtained by applying Proposi-
tion 8.4 and Proposition 8.7, and that Property (H2) is true on an open dense set is a
direct consequence of Lemma 7.21. Remark that the uniformity of the R0 comes from
Remark 7.22.
(cid:107)Dfx − A(cid:107) ≤ δ. We write the Taylor

Thus, for every η > 0, there exists ε > 0 such that for all x ∈ C and all h ∈ B(0, ε), we have

We now take R ≥ R0 (given by hypotheses (H1) and (H2)). We want to ﬁnd an
order of discretization N such that the error made by linearizing f on B(x, R/N) is small
compared to N, that is, for every h ∈ B(0, R/N), we have

To do that, we take η = 1/(40(cid:96)nR), then get a ε > 0 given by Equation (11.3) (we can take
ε as small as we want), and set N = (cid:100)R/ε(cid:101) (thus, we can take N as big as we want). By
Equation (11.3), for every y ∈ B(0, R), we obtain

Combining this result with Hypothesis (H2), we obtain that the proportion of points of
EN ∩ B(x, R/N) whose images by the discretizations of f and that of the linearization of
f in x is smaller than 1/(10(cid:96)). By Hypothesis (H1), the density of the discretization of
the linearization of f in x is close to τ1(Dfx), that is (recall that PN is the projection of X
on EN)

We then tile C by smaller cubes of size of the order of ε (cid:39) R/N. On each of these
squares, by Equation (11.4), the rate of injectivity of f and that of its diﬀerential are
1/2(cid:96)-close. More precisely, using (cid:107)f (cid:107)C1, we can ﬁnd δ > 0 arbitrarily small so that the
images by fN of the δ-interiors of the cubes of the tiling are disjoint; so that the rates of
injectivity on the cubes add. This proves the lemma.

11.2 A local-global formula for Cr-generic expanding maps

and Cr-generic diﬀeomorphisms

The goal of this section is to generalize the results of the previous section : we will
obtain results for the Cr regularity, and for both generic expanding maps and diﬀeomor-
phisms of the torus Tn. Here, the term expanding map is taken from the point of view of
discretizations: we say that a linear map A is expanding if there does not exist two dis-

tinct integer points x, y ∈ Zn such that(cid:98)A(x) =(cid:98)A(y). The main result of this section is that

the rate of injectivity of both generic C1-diﬀeomorphisms and generic Cr-expanding
maps of the torus Tn is obtained from a local-global formula (Theorems 11.11 and
11.16). Let us begin by explaining the case of diﬀeomorphisms.
Theorem 11.11. Let r ≥ 1, and f ∈ Diﬀr(Tn) (or f ∈ Diﬀr(Tn,Leb)) be a generic diﬀeo-
morphism. Then τk(f ) is well deﬁned (that is, the limit superior in (11.1) is a limit) and
satisﬁes:

τk(f ) =

Dfx,··· , Dff k−1(x)

dLeb(x).

(cid:90)

Tn

τk(cid:16)

Moreover, the function τk is continuous in f .

The idea of the proof of this theorem is very simple: locally, the diﬀeomorphism is
almost equal to a linear map. This introduces an intermediate mesoscopic scale on the
torus:

– at the macroscopic scale, the discretization of f acts as f ;
– at the intermediate mesoscopic scale, the discretization of f acts as a linear map;
– at the microscopic scale, we are able to see that the discretization is a ﬁnite map

and we see that the phase space is discrete.

Chapter 11. Degree of recurrence of a generic diﬀeomorphism
228
This remark is formalized by Taylor’s formula: for every ε > 0 and every x ∈ Tn, there
exists ρ > 0 such that f and its Taylor expansion at order 1 are ε-close on B(x, ρ). We then
suppose that the derivative Dfx is “good”: the rate of injectivity of any of its C1-small
perturbations can be seen on a ball BR of Rn (with R uniform in x). Then, the proof of
the local-global formula is made in two steps.

– Prove that “a lot” of maps of SLn(R) are “good”.

This is formalized by
Lemma 11.17, which gives estimations of the size of the perturbations of the lin-
ear map allowed, and of the size of the ball BR. Its proof is quite technical and uses
crucially the formalism of model sets, and an improvement of Weyl’s criterion.

– Prove that for a generic diﬀeomorphism, the derivative satisﬁes the conditions of
Lemma 11.17 at almost every point. This follows easily from Thom’s transversal-
ity theorem.

As the case of expanding maps is more complicated but similar, we will prove the
local-global formula only for expanding maps; the adaptation of it for diﬀeomorphisms
is straightforward.

Remark that the hypothesis of genericity is necessary to get Theorem 11.11. For

example, it can be seen that if we set

f0 =

(cid:32) 1

(cid:33)

,

then τ(f0) = 1/2 whereas τ(f0 + (1/4,3/4)) = 3/4. Thus, if g is a diﬀeomorphism of the
torus which is equal to f0 + v on an open subset of T2, with v a suitable translation
vector, then the conclusions of Theorem 11.11 does not hold (see Example 11.4 for more
explanations).

The deﬁnition of the linear analogue of the rate of injectivity of an expanding map in
time k is more complicated than for diﬀeomorphisms: in this case, the set of preimages
has a structure of d-ary tree. We deﬁne the rate of injectivity of a tree – with edges
decorated by linear expanding maps – as the probability of percolation of a random
graph associated to this decorated tree (see Deﬁnition 11.14). In particular, if all the
expanding maps were equal, then the connected component of the root of this random
graph is a Galton-Watson tree. We begin by the deﬁnition of the set of expanding maps.
Deﬁnition 11.12. For r ≥ 1 and d ≥ 2, we denote by D r(Tn) the set of Cr “Zn-expanding
maps” of Tn for the inﬁnite norm. More precisely, D r(Tn) is the set of maps f : Tn →
Tn, which are local diﬀeomorphisms, such that the derivative f ((cid:98)r(cid:99)) is well deﬁned and
(Tn) and such that for every x ∈ Tn and every v ∈ Zn \ {0}, we have
belongs to Cr−(cid:98)r(cid:99)
(cid:107)Dfxv(cid:107)∞ ≥ 1.
In particular, for f ∈ D r(Tn), the number of preimages of any point of Tn is equal to

a constant, that we denote by d.
expanding maps: f ∈ D r(S1) if and only if it belongs to Cr(S1) and f
x ∈ S1.

Remark that in dimension n = 1, the set D r(S1) coincides with the classical set of
(x) ≥ 1 for every

The set Ik is the linear counterpart of the set(cid:70)k

Deﬁnition 11.14. Let k ∈ N. The complete tree of order k is the rooted d-ary tree Tk whose
vertices are the elements of Ik together with the root, denoted by ∅, and whose edges are
of the form (father(i),i)i∈Ik (see Figure 11.2).
Let (pi)i∈Ik be a family of numbers belonging to [0,1]. These probabilities will be
seen as decorations of the edges of the tree Tk. We will call random graph associated to
(pi)i∈Ik the random subgraph G(pi)i of Tk, such that the laws of appearance the edges
(father(i),i) of G(pi)i are independent Bernoulli laws of parameter pi. In other words,
G(pi)i is obtained from Tk by erasing independently each vertex of Tk with probability
1− pi.
We deﬁne the mean density D((pi)i) of (pi)i∈Ik as the probability that in G(pi)i, there

application of Taylor’s theorem and Thom’s transversality theorem (Lemma 11.20).

The next lemma uses the strategy of proof of Weyl’s criterion to get a uniform con-
vergence in Birkhoﬀ’s theorem for rotations of the torus Tn whose rotation vectors are

The second part of the lemma is an eﬀective improvement of the ﬁrst one. To ob-
tain the bound (11.6), we combine Lemma 11.18 with Lemma 11.19 to get that for
every ε > 0, there exists a locally ﬁnite collection of submanifolds Vq of (GLn(R))Card Ik

for every q, then Equation (11.11) is true up to ε.

The other bound (11.7) is obtained independently from the rest of the proof by a

direct application of Lemma 11.18 and of Lemma 11.19 applied to k = 1.

We can now begin the proof of Theorem 11.16.

Proof of Theorem 11.16. Let f ∈ D r(Tn). The idea is to cut the torus Tn into small pieces
on which f is very close to its Taylor expansion at order 1.
Let m ∈ N, and U(cid:96) ((cid:96) ∈ N∗

To do that, we ﬁrst set (cid:96)

(that is, the right side of Equation (11.5)). We want to show that U(cid:96) contains an open
and dense subset of D r(Tn). In other words, we pick a map f , an integer (cid:96) and δ > 0,
and we want to ﬁnd another map g ∈ D r(Tn) which is δ-close to f for the Cr distance,
and which belongs to the interior of U(cid:96).

Lemma 11.17 to get a locally ﬁnite union of positive codimension submanifolds Vq of
(GLn(R))Card(Ik). We then apply Lemma 11.20 to these submanifolds, to the δ we have
ﬁxed at the beginning of the proof and to (cid:96)
= 4(cid:96); this gives us a parameter η > 0 and a
map g ∈ D r(Tn) such that dCr (f , g) < δ, and such that the set

mula for Cr-diﬀeomorphisms (Theorem 11.11).

11.3 Asymptotic rate of injectivity for a generic dissipative

diﬀeomorphism

First of all, we tackle the issue of the asymptotic rate of injectivity of generic dissipa-
tive diﬀeomorphisms. We will deduce it from a theorem of A. Avila and J. Bochi. Again,
we will consider the torus Tn equipped with Lebesgue measure Leb and the canonical
measures EN, see Section 11.6 for a more general setting where the result is still true.
The study of the rate of injectivity for generic dissipative diﬀeomorphisms is based on
the following theorem of A. Avila and J. Bochi.

(cid:48)
6. Recall that (Zn)

stands for the set of points of Rn at least one coordinate of which belongs to Z+1/2.

11.3. Asymptotic rate of injectivity for a generic dissipative diﬀeomorphism

237

Theorem 11.22 (Avila, Bochi). Let f be a generic C1 maps of Tn. Then for every ε > 0, there
exists a compact set K ⊂ Tn and an integer m ∈ N such that

Leb(K) > 1− ε

and

Leb(f m(K)) < ε.

This statement is obtained by combining Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 of [AB06].

Remark 11.23. As C1 expanding maps of Tn and C1 diﬀeomorphisms of Tn are open
subsets of the set of C1 maps of Tn, the same theorem holds for generic C1 expanding
maps and C1 diﬀeomorphisms of Tn (this had already been proved in the case of C1-
expanding maps by A. Quas in [Qua99]).

This theorem can be used to compute the asymptotic rate of injectivity of a generic

diﬀeomorphism.

Corollary 11.24. The asymptotic rate of injectivity of a generic dissipative diﬀeomorphism
f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb) is equal to 0. In particular, the degree of recurrence D(fN) of a generic
dissipative diﬀeomorphism tends to 0 when N goes to inﬁnity.

Proof of Corollary 11.24. The proof of this corollary mainly consists in stating which
good properties can be supposed to possess the compact set K of Theorem 11.22. Thus,
for f a generic diﬀeomorphism and ε > 0, there exists m > 0 and a compact set K such
that Leb(K) > 1− ε and Leb(f m(K)) < ε.

Chapter 11. Degree of recurrence of a generic diﬀeomorphism

11.4 Asymptotic rate of injectivity for a generic conservative

diﬀeomorphism

N(f ) < 1, in particular

The goal of this section is to prove that the degree of recurrence of a generic conser-
vative C1-diﬀeomorphism is equal to 0. It will be obtained by using the local-global for-
mula (Theorem 11.8) and the result about the asymptotic rate of injectivity of a generic
sequence of matrices (Theorem 8.24). As a warm-up, we begin by a weak and very easy
version of this statement, which already shows that the discretizations of generic con-
servative C1-diﬀeomorphism do not behave in the same fashion as discretization of a
generic conservative homeomorphism.
Proposition 11.25. For a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), we have
N→+∞τ1
lim
Proof of Proposition 11.25. To prove this proposition, we prove that on an open and
dense set of diﬀeomorphisms f , we have
N→+∞τ1
N(f ) < 1. This is easily obtained
lim
Indeed, we take a diﬀeomorphism f ∈
by perturbing locally any diﬀeomorphism.
Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb) and a point x ∈ Tn. Then, we perturb the diﬀerential of f at x such that
τ1(Dfx) < 1 (the set of matrices satisfying this property is locally included in a ﬁnite
union of submanifolds of codimension at least 1, see Corollary 8.22). We then apply the
local linearization theorem to get a diﬀeomorphism which is linear in a neighbourhood
of x. Thus, τ1(f ) < 1 by the local-global formula Theorem 11.8, and this remains true
on a whole neighbourhood of f by the continuity of τ1 (Corollary 11.9).
Theorem 11.26. For a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), we have

N→+∞D(fN) < 1.
lim

t→∞ τk(f ) = 0;
lim

more precisely, for every ε > 0, the set of diﬀeomorphisms f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb) such that
limt→+∞ τk(f ) < ε is open and dense.

In particular 7, we have limN→+∞ D(fN) = 0.

Proof of theorem 11.26. We show that for every (cid:96) ∈ N and every ε > 0, the set of conser-
vative diﬀeomorphisms such that limt→∞τt∞ < 1/(cid:96) + ε contains an open dense subset of
Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb). To begin with, we ﬁx f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb) and δ > 0 (which will be a size
of perturbation of f ). By Theorem 8.24, and in particular Equation (8.9), there exists
a parameter λ ∈]0,1[ (depending only on δ, (cid:96) and (cid:107)f (cid:107)C1), such that for every sequence
(Ak)k≥1 of linear maps in SLn(R), there exists a sequence (Bk)k≥1 of (generic) linear maps
in SLn(R) such that for each k, we have (cid:107)Ak−Bk(cid:107) ≤ δ and τ(cid:96)k(B1,··· , B(cid:96)k) ≤ λk +1/(cid:96) (as the
sequence is generic, this property remains true on a whole neighbourhood of (Bk)k≥1,
see Remark 8.43). From that parameter λ, we deduce a time k0 > 0 such that

– the measure of the union of the “ﬂoors” U ∪ f (U) ∪ ··· ∪ f k0−1(U) is bigger than
1− ε/100

For the existence of such towers, see for example [Gui12, Lemme 6.8] or [Hal56, Chapter
“Uniform topology”].

We then approach the basis U by a union of cubes of a dyadic subdivision of Tn
(as in page 237, from now we suppose that U is a union of such cubes). If that dyadic
subdivision is ﬁne enough, on each cube C, it is possible to perturb f into a diﬀeomor-
phism g such that on each set (1− ε/100)C, g is aﬃne and irrational, using Lemma 11.6
and Franks lemma (see [Fra71] or [Cro06b]), which is valid only in the C1 topology.
We do the same thing on the k0 − 1 ﬁrst images of each cube and perturb g such that
on each set gk((1− ε/100)C), the perturbed diﬀeomorphism h is linear and equal to Bk.
By what we have said at the beginning of the proof, we can moreover suppose that the
sequence B1,··· , Bk0 of linear maps is generic, and satisﬁes τk(B1,··· , Bk) ≤ λk + 1/(cid:96) for
every k ≤ k0 − 1. By the choice of k0 we have made, this implies that

Moreover, the diﬀerentials of h form generic sequences on a set of measure at least
1−ε/10. This implies that the rate of injectivity os continuous in h when restricted to this
subset of Tn. Thus, the inequality τk0(h) ≤ 1/(cid:96) + ε still holds on a whole neighbourhood
of h. This proves the theorem.

On Figure 11.5, we have represented graphically the quantity D((f5)128k) for k from

to 0. In fact, it is even decreasing, and converges quite fast to 0: as soon as N = 128, the
degree of recurrence is smaller than 1/2, and if N (cid:38) 1000, then D((f5)N) ≤ 1/10.

11.5 Asymptotic rate of injectivity of a generic Cr expanding

map

In this section, we prove that the asymptotic rate of injectivity of a generic expand-
ing map is equal to 0. Note that a local version of this result was already obtained by
P.P. Flockermann in his thesis (Corollary 2 page 69 and Corollary 3 page 71 of [Flo02]),
stating that for a generic C1+α expanding map f of the circle, the “local asymptotic rate
of injectivity” is equal to 0 almost everywhere. Some of his arguments will be used
in this section. Note also that in C1 regularity, the equality τ
(f ) = 0 for a generic f
is a consequence of Theorem 11.22 of A. Avila and J. Bochi (see also Corollary 11.24);
the same theorem even proves that the asymptotic rate of injectivity of a generic C1
endomorphism of the circle is equal to 0.

The second part of the lemma is deduced from the ﬁrst one by applying the theo-
rem stating that for every Cr expanding map f of S1 (r > 1), the maps L m1 converge
uniformly towards a Hölder map, which is the density of the unique SRB measure of f
(see for example [FJ03]). The ﬁrst assertion of the lemma follows from the convergence

The proof of this lemma is straightforward but quite long. We sketch here this proof,
the reader will ﬁnd a complete proof using generating functions in Section 3.4 of [Flo02]
and a quantitative version of it in Section 12.2 of [Gui15c].

Sketch of proof of Lemma 11.31. As f is C1, by the mean value theorem, for every seg-

ment I small enough, we have (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Leb(I)− Leb(f (I))
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ ε.

These two inequalities allows to prove the local convergence of the measures f

towards the measure with density Lf 1. The same kind of arguments holds in arbitrary
times, and allow to prove the lemma.
Proof of Proposition 11.28. We ﬁx ε > 0, and set K = (cid:100)Σ0/ε(cid:101) (the constant Σ0 being given
by Lemma 11.29) and

bm = P(0 < Zm ≤ K) ,
We want to prove that the sequence (am)m∈N tends to 1.

am = P(Zm = 0) ,

cm = P(Zm > K).

Of course, am+bm+cm = 1 for any m. We then remark that a generation with less than
K children will give birth to zero child with positive probability: we have the inequality

P(Zm+1 = 0 | 0 < Zm ≤ K) ≥

In other words, setting α = (1−(cid:107)f

11.6 A more general setting where the theorems are still true

Here, we give weaker assumptions under which the theorems of Sections 11.1, 11.3,
11.4 and 12.1.1 (that is, Theorems 11.3, 11.8, 11.26 and 12.1, and Corollaries 11.9, 11.24
and 11.10) are still true: the framework “torus Tn with grids EN and Lebesgue measure”
could be seen as a little too restrictive.

So, we take a compact smooth manifold M (possibly with boundary) and choose a
partition M1,··· , Mk of M into closed sets 8 with smooth boundaries, such that for every
i, there exists a chart ϕi : Mi → Rn. We endow Rn with the euclidean distance, which
deﬁnes a distance on M via the charts φi (this distance is not necessarily continuous).
From now, we study what happens on a single chart, as what happens on the neigh-
Finally, we suppose that the uniform measures on the grids EN =(cid:83)
bourhoods of the boundaries of these charts “counts for nothing” from the Lebesgue
measure viewpoint.

i EN,i converge

to a smooth measure λ on M when N goes to inﬁnity.

This can be easily seen that these conditions are suﬃcient for Corollary 11.24 to be

still true.

For the rest of the statements of this chapter, we need that the grids behave locally

as the canonical grids on the torus.

canonical projections by the projections πN,i, and Lebesgue measure by the measure λ.

On Figure 11.7, we have represented the quantity D((f )128k) for k from 1 to 1000. It
appears that, as predicted by the theorem of P.P. Flockermann (Corollary 2 page 69 and
Corollary 3 page 71 of [Flo02]), this degree of recurrence seems to tend to 0. In fact,
it is even decreasing, and converges quite fast to 0: as soon as N = 128, the degree of
recurrence is smaller than 1/5, and if N (cid:38) 25000, then D((f )N) ≤ 1/50.

Fore a more general setting where the theorems of this section are still true, see Sec-
tion 11.6.

This chapter is devoted to the study of the physical measures of the discretizations
of a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism. Recall the classical deﬁnition of a physical
measure for a map f : a Borel probability measure µ is called physical for the map f if
its basin of attraction has positive Lebesgue measure, where the basin of attraction of µ
is the set

(see also Deﬁnition 3.9). Heuristically, the physical measures are the ones that can be
observed in practical experiments, because they are “seen” by a set of points x of pos-
itive Lebesgue measure. Here, our aim is to study similar concepts in the view of dis-
cretizations: which measures can be seen by the discretizations of generic conservative
C1-diﬀeomorphisms?

Remember that we denote by µfN

x the limit of the Birkhoﬀ sums

More concretely, µfN
x is the fN-invariant probability measure supported by the periodic
orbit on which the positive orbit of xN = PN(x) falls after a while (see also Deﬁnition 3.10

245

246

Chapter 12. Physical measures

page 46). We would like to know the answer the following question: for a generic
conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism f , does the sequence of measure µfN
x tend to a physical
measure of f for most of the points x as N goes to inﬁnity?
Recall that in the C0 case, we have proved Theorem 5.51, which implies in particular
that for a generic homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(Tn,Leb) and every x ∈ Tn, the measures
µfN
x accumulate on the whole set of f -invariant measures when N goes to inﬁnity (more-
over, given an f -invariant measure µ, the sequence (Nk)k≥0 such that µ
tends to µ can
be chosen independently of x). In a certain sense, this theorem in the case of homeomor-
phisms expresses that from the point of view of the discretizations, all the f -invariant
measures are physical.

fNk
x

In the C1-case, we have already proved Corollary 10.9 (in Chapter 10), which states
that for a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism f , any f -invariant measure is the
limit of a sequence of fN-invariant measures. This corollary has been obtained as a
simple consequence of an ergodic closing lemma of R. Mañé and F. Abdenur, C. Bonatti
and S. Crovisier (Theorem 10.8); however it does not say anything about the basin of
attraction of these discrete measures.

In the theorem we prove in this chapter (Theorem 12.1), we improve the previous
statement for generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphisms, in order to describe the basin
of attraction of the discrete measures. In particular, we prove that for points x belonging
to a generic subset of points of the torus, the measures µfN
x accumulate on the whole set
of f -invariant measures (Theorem 12.1). Notice that given an f -invariant measure µ,
fNk
converges to µ depends on the point x, contrary to
the sequence (Nk)k such that µ
x
what happens in the C0 case.
Moreover, if we ﬁx a countable subset D ⊂ Tn, then for a generic conservative C1-
diﬀeomorphism f and for any x ∈ D, the measures µfN
x accumulate on the whole set
of f -invariant measures (Addendum 12.2). This is a process that is usually applied in
practice to detect the f -invariant measures: ﬁx a ﬁnite set D ⊂ Tn and compute the
x for x ∈ D and for a large order of discretization N. The theoretical result
measure µfN
expresses that it is possible that the measure that we observe on numerical experiments
is very far away from the physical measure.

Note that in the space Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), there are open sets where generic diﬀeomor-
phisms are ergodic: the set of Anosov diﬀeomorphisms is open in Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), and a
generic Anosov conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism is ergodic (it is a consequence of the
fact that any C2 Anosov conservative diﬀeomorphism is ergodic, together with the the-
orem of regularization of conservative diﬀeomorphisms of A. Avila [Avi10]). More gen-
erally, A. Avila, S. Crovisier and A. Wilkinson have set recently in [ACW14] a generic
dichotomy for a conservative diﬀeomorphism f : either f is ergodic, either all the Lya-
punov exponents of f vanish. In short, there are open sets where generic conservative
diﬀeomorphisms have only one physical measure; in this case, our result asserts that
this physical measure is not detected on discretizations by computing the measures
µfN
x .

Recall that results of stochastic stability are known to be true in various contexts (for
example, expanding maps [Kif86a],[Kif86b], [Kel82], uniformly hyperbolic attractors
[Kif86b], [You86], etc.). These theorems suggest that the physical measures can always
be observed in practice, even if the system is noisy. Our Theorem 12.1 indicates that the
eﬀects of discretizations (i.e. numerical truncation) might be quite diﬀerent from those
of a random noise.

12.1. Physical measures of discretizations of generic diﬀeomorphisms

247

However, we shall remark that the same proof as for Theorem 12.1 implies that for
a generic diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb) and a generic point x ∈ Tn (or equivalently,
for any x ∈ Tn and for a generic f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb)), the measures

m−1(cid:88)

accumulate on the whole set of f -invariant measures.

The proof of Theorem 12.1 uses crucially the results of Part 2 on the fact that the
asymptotic rate is null (in particular Lemma 8.55); it also uses two connecting lemmas
(Theorem 10.3 of [BC04] and an improvement of Theorem 10.8 of [ABC11]).

At the end of this chapter, we present numerical experiments simulating the mea-
for some examples of conservative C1-diﬀeomorphisms f of the torus. The
sures µfN
x
results of these simulations are quite striking for an example of f C1-close to Id (see Fig-
ure 12.7): even for very large orders N, the measures µfN
x do not converge to Lebesgue
measure at all, and are very diﬀerent ones from the others. This illustrates perfectly
Theorem 12.1 (more precisely, Addendum 12.2), which states that if x is ﬁxed, then for
a generic f ∈ Diﬀ1(T2,Leb), the measures µfN
x accumulate on the whole set of f -invariant
measures, but do not say anything about, for instance, the frequency of orders N such
that µfN
x is not close to Lebesgue measure. Moreover, the same phenomenon (although
less pronounced) occurs for diﬀeomorphisms close to a translation of T2 (Figure 12.8)
or a linear Anosov automorphism (Figure 12.9).

Remark that the theorem in the C0 case is almost the same, except that here, the
starting point x ∈ Tn is no longer arbitrary but has to be chosen in a generic subset of
the torus, and that the sequence (Nk)k depends on the starting point x. The proof of this
theorem will also lead to the two following statements.

Chapter 12. Physical measures

The ﬁrst statement asserts that if f is a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism,
then for any f -invariant measure µ, there exists an inﬁnite number of discretizations fN
which possess an invariant measure which is close tu µ, and whose basin of attraction
is ε-dense. Basically, for an inﬁnite number of N any f -invariant will be seen from any
region of the torus.

In the second statement, a countable set of starting points of the experiment is cho-
sen “by the user”. This is quite close to what happens in practice: we take a ﬁnite
xm,T for all m, for a big N ∈ N
number of points x1,··· , xm and compute the measures µ
fNk
and for “large” times T (we can expect that T is large enough to have µ
xm ). In
this case, the result expresses that it may happen (in fact, for arbitrarily large N) that
fNk
the measures µ
xm,T are not close to the physical measure of f but are rather chosen “at
random” among the set of f -invariant measures.

We also have a dissipative counterpart of Theorem 12.1, whose proof is easier.

Theorem 12.3. For a generic dissipative diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn), for any f -invariant
probability measure µ such that the sum of the Lyapunov exponents of µ is negative (or equal
to 0), for a generic point x belonging to the same chain recurrent class as µ, there exists a
subsequence (Nk)k of discretizations such that

Remark that if we also consider the inverse f

Diﬀ1(Tn), we can recover any invariant measure µ of f by looking at the measures µ
for generic points x in the chain recurrent class of µ.

The proof of this result is obtained by applying Lemma 12.12 during the proof of

Theorem 12.1.

The proof of this statement is far easier than that of Theorem 12.1 , as it can be
d (S1) is homeo-

obtained by coding any expanding map of class C1 (that is, any f ∈ E 1
morphic to a full shift on a set with d elements).

We will use the connecting lemma for pseudo-orbits (see [BC04], see also Theo-
rem 10.3), together with an ergodic closing lemma (adapted from [ABC11]) and the
results of Part 2 on the fact that the asymptotic rate is null (in particular Lemma 8.55),
to prove that any invariant measure of the diﬀeomorphism can be observed by starting
at any point of a generic subset of Tn.

By Baire theorem and the fact that for a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism, a
generic invariant measure is ergodic, non periodic and has no zero Lyapunov exponent
(see Theorem 3.5 of [ABC11]), the proof of Theorem 12.1 can be reduced easily to that
of the following approximation lemma.

12.1. Physical measures of discretizations of generic diﬀeomorphisms
249
Lemma 12.5. For every f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb), for every f -invariant measure µ which is ergodic,
not periodic and has no zero Lyapunov exponent, for every open subset U ⊂ Tn, for every C1-
neighbourhood V of f , for every ε > 0 and every N0 ∈ N, there exists g ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb) such
that g ∈ V , there exists y ∈ U and N ≥ N0 such that dist(µ, µgN
y ) < ε. Moreover, we can
suppose that this property remains true on a whole neighbourhood of g.

First of all, we explain how to deduce Theorem 12.1 from Lemma 12.5.

Proof of Theorem 12.1. We consider a sequence (ν(cid:96))(cid:96)≥0 of Borel probability measures,
which is dense in the whole set of probability measures. We also consider a sequence
(Ui)i≥0 of open subsets of Tn which spans the topology of Tn. This allows us to set

(cid:40)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ∃µ f -inv. : dist(µ, ν(cid:96)) ≤ 1/k0 =⇒
f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb)
(cid:92)

∃N ≥ N0, y ∈ Ui : d(µfN

y , ν(cid:96)) < 2/k0

(cid:41)

.

S N0,k0,(cid:96),i =

We easily see that the set

S N0,k0,(cid:96),i

N0,k0,(cid:96),i≥0

in contained in the set of diﬀeomorphisms satisfying the conclusions of the theorem.

It remains to prove that each set S N0,k0,(cid:96),i contains an open and dense subset of
Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb). Actually the interior of each set S N0,k0,(cid:96),i is dense. This follows from 1 the
upper semi-continuity of the set of f -invariant measures with respect to f and from the
combination of Lemma 12.5 with the fact that for a generic diﬀeomorphism, a generic
invariant measure is ergodic, non periodic and has no zero Lyapunov exponent (see
Theorem 3.5 of [ABC11]).

The rest of this chapter is devoted to the proof of Lemma 12.5. We now outline the

main arguments of this quite long and technical proof.
Sketch of proof of Lemma 12.5. First of all, we take a point x ∈ Tn which is typical
for the measure µ. In particular, by an ergodic closing lemma derived from that of
F. Abdenur, C. Bonatti and S. Crovisier [ABC11] (Lemma 12.6), there is a perturbation
of f (still denoted by f ) so that the orbit ω of x is periodic of period τ1; moreover,
ω can be supposed to bear an invariant measure close to µ, to have an arbitrary large
length, and to have Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov subspaces close to that of µ
under f . Applying the (diﬃcult) connecting lemma for pseudo-orbits of C. Bonatti and
S. Crovisier [BC04], we get another perturbation of the diﬀeomorphism (still denoted
by f ), such that the stable manifold of x under f meets the open set U at a point that
we denote by y.

So, we need to perturb the diﬀeomorphism f so that:
– the periodic orbit x is stabilized by fN. This can be easily made by a small pertur-

bation of f ;

– the positive orbit of y under fN falls on the periodic orbit of x under fN. This is
the diﬃcult part of the proof: we can apply the previous strategy to put every
point of the positive orbit of y on the grid only during a ﬁnite time. It becomes
impossible to perform perturbations to put the orbit of y on the grid – without
perturbing the orbit of x – as soon as this orbit comes into a C/N- neighbourhood
of the orbit of x (where C is a constant depending on V ).

1. See the proof of Theorem 5.45 for more details on the same kind of arguments.

Figure 12.1: During the proof of Lemma 12.5, it is easy to perturb the ﬁrst points of
the orbit of y (small disks) until the orbit meets the neighbourhoods of the orbits of x
where the diﬀeomorphism is linear (inside of the circles). The diﬃculty of the proof is
to make appropriate perturbations in these small neighbourhoods.

To solve this problem, we need the results about the linear case we have proved in
Chapter 8. They allow us to ﬁnd a point z whose distance to the orbit of x is bigger than
C/N, and such that for t large enough, f t

N(z) belongs to the orbit of x under fN.

In more detail, we use Lemma 11.6 to linearize locally the diﬀeomorphism in the
neighbourhood of the periodic orbit of ω. In particular, the positive orbit of y eventually
= f T1(y). To
belongs to this linearizing neighbourhood, from a time T1. We denote y
summarize, the periodic orbit ω bears a measure close to µ, its Lyapunov exponents are
close to that of µ, its Lyapunov linear subspaces are close to that of µ (maybe not all
along the periodic orbit, but at least for the ﬁrst iterates of x). The diﬀeomorphism f
is linear around each point of ω. Finally, the stable manifold of ω meets U at y, and
the positive orbit of y is included in the neighbourhood of ω where f is linear from the
point y

= f T1(y).

(cid:48)

(cid:48)

(cid:48)

We then choose an integer N large enough, and perturb the orbit of x such that it
is stabilized by the discretization fN. We want to make another perturbation of f such
that the backward orbit of x by fN also contains y
(recall that fN is not necessarily one-
to-one). This is done by a perturbation supported in the neighbourhood of ω where
f is linear. First of all, during a time t4 ≥ 0, we apply Lemma 8.55 of Chapter 8 to
−t4(x) where f is linear, but far enough from
ﬁnd a point z in the neighbourhood of f
−t4(x) compared to 1/N, such that the t4-th image of z by the discretization fN is equal
f
−t3(z)
to x. Next, we perturb the orbit of z under f
−t4−t3(x). Note that the support of this perturbation
belongs to the stable subspace of f
must be disjoint from ω; this is the reason why z must be “far enough from x”. Finally,
we ﬁnd another time t2 such that the negative orbit {f
−t3−t2(z) has an
hyperbolic behaviour. We then perturb each point of the negative orbit of z
(within
the stable manifold of ω), so that it contains an arbitrary point of the stable manifold of
ω, far enough from ω. This allows us to meet the point y
, provided that the order of

discretizations N is large enough.

To complete the proof, we we consider the segment of f -orbit joining y to z; we
perturb each one of these points to put them on the grid EN (with a perturbation whose
supports size is proportional to 1/N).

Notice that we shall have chosen carefully the parameters of the ﬁrst perturbations
in order to make this ﬁnal perturbation possible. Also, remark that the length of the
periodic orbit ω must be very large compared to the times t2, t3 and t4. This is why we
will perform the proof in the opposite direction : we will begin by choosing the times ti
and make the perturbation of the dynamics afterwards.

Note that the Addendum 12.2 can be proved by using a small variation on

Lemma 12.5, that we will explain at the end of Section 12.1.3.

12.1.2 An improved ergodic closing lemma

The proof of Theorem 12.1 begins by the approximation of any invariant measure
µ of any conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism by a periodic measure of a diﬀeomorphism g
close to f . This is done by R. Mañé’s ergodic closing lemma, but we will need the fact
that the obtained periodic measure inherits some of the properties of the measure µ.
More precisely, given a C1-diﬀeomorphism f , we will have to approach any non peri-
odic ergodic measure of f with nonzero Lyapunov exponent by a periodic measure of
a diﬀeomorphism g close to f , such that the Lyapunov exponents and the Lyapunov
subspaces of the measure are close to that of f by µ. We will obtain this result by modi-
fying slightly the proof of a lemma obtained by F. Abdenur, C. Bonatti and S. Crovisier
in [ABC11] (Proposition 6.1).
Lemma 12.6 (Ergodic closing lemma). Let f ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb). We consider

– a number ε > 0;
– a C1-neighbourhood V of f ;
– a time τ0 ∈ N;
– an ergodic measure µ without zero Lyapunov exponent;
– a point x ∈ X which is typical for µ (see the beginning of the paragraph 6.1 of [ABC11]);
moreover, we denote by λ the smallest absolute value of the Lyapunov exponents of µ, by
diﬀeomorphism g ∈ Diﬀ1(Tn,Leb) and a time (cid:101)t0 > 0 (depending only in f , µ and x) such

Step 0: elementary perturbation lemmas. During the proof of Lemma 12.5, we will
use three diﬀerent elementary perturbation lemmas.

The ﬁrst one is the elementary perturbation lemma in C1 topology we stated in

Chapter 10 (Lemma 10.1). It allows to perturb locally the orbit of a diﬀeomorphism.

The second one is an easy corollary of the ﬁrst one. We will use it to perturb a
segment of orbit such that for any N large enough, each point of this segment of orbit
belongs to the grid EN.

Proof of Lemma 12.9. Take an appropriate Hamiltonian, see Figure 12.2.

Step 1: choice of the starting point x of the orbit. Let λ be the smallest absolute value
of the Lyapunov exponents of µ (in particular, λ > 0).

We choose a point x which is regular for the measure µ: we suppose that it sat-

lemma (see Paragraph 6.1 of [ABC11]). We denote by Ff
x the stable subspace and Gf

between the stable and unstable subspaces is

the growth of the angles ∠(cid:16)

Step 2: choice of the parameters we use to apply the ergodic closing lemma.
In this
second step, we determine the time during which we need an estimation of the angle
between the stable and unstable subspaces of f and its perturbations, and the minimal
length of the approximating periodic orbit.

f t1−t2 (x).

We ﬁrst use the “hyperbolic-like” behaviour of f near the orbit of x: for well chosen
−t2 into a
f t1 (x) is mapped by Df
f t1 (x), it will allow us to perturb

times t1 and t2, each vector which is not too close to Gf
f t1−t2 (x). Given a vector v ∈ TTn
vector which is close to Ff
−1 belongs to Ff
f into g such that an iterate of v under Dg

is such that the angle between v and Gf t1 (x) is bigger than α, then the angle between Df
f t1 (x)v
and Ff t1−t2 (x) is smaller than α (see Figure 12.4).
Proof of Lemma 12.10. It easily follows from Oseledets theorem, and more precisely
from the fact that the function exp(tλ)/∠(Ff t(x), Gf t(x)) goes to +∞ when t goes to +∞.
(cid:16)
So, we ﬁx two times t1 and t2 ≥ 0, obtained by applying Lemma 12.10 to α =

x2, g2(x2),··· , gτ0−t2−t3−t4
is bigger than 3, but it can be supposed true by taking
a bigger τ0 if necessary. This gives us a ﬁrst perturbation g1 of the diﬀeomorphism
f , such that the point x1 is periodic under g1 with period τ1 ≥ τ0, and such that the
Lyapunov exponents of x1 for g1 are close to that of x1 under f , and the stable and
unstable subspaces of g1 at the point gt

every t ∈ (cid:126)0, t3 + t2(cid:127).

than 3, thus we will be able to apply Lemma 12.8 to every point of the orbit belonging

are stable under C1 perturbation.

We then use the connecting lemma for pseudo-orbits of C. Bonatti and S. Crovisier
(Theorem 10.3, see [BC04]), which implies that the stable manifolds of the periodic
orbits of a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism are dense. This allows us to perturb
the diﬀeomorphism g1 into a diﬀeomorphism g2 ∈ V (cid:48)
such that there exists a point x2
close to x1 such that:
(1) x2 is periodic for g2 with the same period than that of x1 under g1, and moreover

the periodic orbit of x2 under g2 shadows that of x1 under g1;

(2) the Lyapunov exponents and the Lyapunov subspaces of x2 for g2 are very close to
that of x1 for g1 (see the conclusions of Lemma 12.6, in particular the Lyapunov
subspaces are close during a time t3 + t2);

(3) the stable manifold of x2 under g2 meets the set U, at a point denoted by y2.

Step 4: linearization near the periodic orbit. We then use Franks lemma (see [Fra71])
to perturb slightly the diﬀerentials of g2 at the points gt2+t3
(x2), such
that these diﬀerentials belong to the open set of matrices deﬁned by Lemma 8.55 of
Chapter 8. This gives us another diﬀeomorphism g3 ∈ V (cid:48)
close to g2, such that the
point x2 still satisﬁes the nice properties (1), (2) and (3).

(x2), ··· , gt2+t3+t4

By Lemma 11.6, there exists a parameter r > 0 such that it is possible to linearize g3
in the r-neighbourhood of the periodic orbit of x2, without changing the nice properties
(1), (2) and (3) of the periodic orbit of x2. We can choose r small enough so that the 10 r-
neighbourhoods of the points of the periodic orbit of x2 are pairwise disjoint. This
gives us a diﬀeomorphism g4, to which are associated two points x4 and y4, such that x4
satisﬁes the properties (1), (2) and (3), and such that:
(4) the diﬀerentials of f at the points gt2+t3
of matrices of Lemma 8.55 of Chapter 8;

(x4) lie in the open dense set

(5) g4 is linear in the r-neighbourhood of each point of the periodic orbit of x4.

Chapter 12. Physical measures
Step 5: choice of the order of discretization. We choose a neighbourhood V (cid:48)(cid:48) ⊂ V (cid:48)
of g4 such that properties (1) to (3) are still true for every diﬀeomorphism g ∈ V (cid:48)(cid:48)
. We
denote by ωx4 the periodic orbit of x4 under g4, and by B(ωx4, r) the r-neighbourhood of
4(y4) ∈ B(ωx4, r/2)
this periodic orbit. We also denote T1 the smallest integer such that gt

Step 6: application of the linear theorem. By the hypothesis (ii) on N, we are able to

of the periodic orbit ωx4 such that we obtain a diﬀeomorphism g5 ∈ V (cid:48)(cid:48)

In particular, the periodic orbit of x5 under g5 is stabilized by the discretization (g5)N

By construction of the diﬀeomorphism g5 (more precisely, the hypotheses (4), (5),

in a ball centred at z and with radius d(z, x6), so that this perturbation does not change
the orbit of x6. Under these conditions, we satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma 12.10, thus
the angle between
t3 (x6) is smaller than α. Another perturbation,
t3 (x6). This gives
described by Figure 12.3, allows us to suppose that g
us a diﬀeomorphism that we still denote by g6. Remark that it was possible to make
these perturbations independently because the segment of negative orbit of the point z

Thus, by hypothesis (iv), it is possible to apply Lemma 12.11 to our setting. This

gives us a diﬀeomorphism g7.

Step 8: ﬁnal perturbation to put the segment of orbit on the grid. To summarize, we
have a diﬀeomorphism g7 ∈ V (cid:48)
, and periodic orbit ωx7 of g7, stabilized by (g7)N, which
bears a measure close to µ. We also have a segment of real orbit of g7 which links the
N(z) ∈ (ωx7)N. To ﬁnish the proof of the
points y7 ∈ U and z, where z is such that (g7)t4
lemma, it remains to perturb g7 so that the segment of orbit which links the points y7
and z is stabilized by the discretization (g7)N.

We now observe that by the construction we have made, the distance between two

(cid:48)
is bigger than (1 + η

Indeed, if we take one point of the segment of forward orbit z, g

(z),
and one point in the periodic orbit ωx7, this is due to the hypothesis (cid:107)z − x7(cid:107) ≥ R0/N (R0
being deﬁned by Equation (12.2)) combined with Equation (12.3). If we take one point
in this segment z, g
(z), and one among the rest of the points (that is, the
segment of orbit between y7 and z), this is due to the fact that the Lyapunov exponent
of gτ1

7 in x7 is bigger than 3, and to Equation (12.4).
If we take one point of the form g

−t
7 (z), with t > t2 + t3, but belonging to the neigh-
bourhood of ωx7 where g7 is linear, and one point of ωx7, this follows from the estimation
given by Equation (12.1) applied to (cid:107)v(cid:107) ≥ R0/N. If for the second point, instead of con-
sidering a point of ωx7, we take an element of the segment of orbit between y7 and z,
this follows from the fact that the Lyapunov exponent of gτ1

7 in x7 is bigger than 3.

Finally, for the points of the orbit that are not in the neighbourhood of ωx7 where g7

is linear, the property arises from hypothesis (iii) made on N.

Thus, by Lemma 12.8, we are able to perturb each of the points of the segment of
orbit under g7 between y7 and z, such that each of these points belongs to the grid. This
gives us a diﬀeomorphism g8 ∈ V .
To conclude, we have a point y8 ∈ U whose orbit under (g8)N falls on the periodic

orbit (ωx7)N, which bears a measure ε-close to µ. The lemma is proved.

260

Chapter 12. Physical measures

The proof in higher dimensions is almost identical. The perturbation lemmas are
still true 5, and the arguments easily adapts by considering the “super-stable” mani-
fold of the orbit ωx, that is the set of points y ∈ Tn whose positive orbit is tangent to
the Oseledets subspace corresponding to the maximal Lyapunov exponent. In particu-
lar, Lemma 12.6 is still true in this setting, and the connecting lemma (Theorem 10.3)
implies that generically, this “super-stable” manifold is dense in Tn.

The proofs of the two statements of the addendum are almost identical.
For the ﬁrst statement (the fact that for every ε > 0, the basin of attraction of the
discrete measure can be supposed to contain a ε-dense subset of the torus), we apply
exactly the same proof than that of Lemma 12.5: making smaller perturbations of the
diﬀeomorphism if necessary, we can suppose that the stable manifold of y8 is ε-dense.
Thus, there exists a segment of backward orbit of y8 which is ε-dense, and we apply the
same strategy of proof consisting in putting this segment of orbit on the grid.

For the second statement, it suﬃces to apply the strategy of the ﬁrst statement, and
to conjugate the obtained diﬀeomorphism g9 by an appropriate conservative diﬀeomor-
phism with small norm (this norm can be supposed to be as small as desired by taking
ε small), so that the image of the ε-dense subset of T2 by the conjugation contains the
set E.

To obtain Theorem 12.3 (dealing with the dissipative case) it suﬃces to replace the

use of Lemmas 12.10 and 8.55 by the following easier statement.
Lemma 12.12. For every α > 0 and every R0 > 0, there exists three times t1, t2 ≥ 0 and t4 ≥ 0
such that:

– there exists v ∈ TTn

f t1 (x)

∩ Zn such that (cid:107)v(cid:107) ≥ R0 and
(cid:17)
◦···◦(cid:99)Df f t1 (x)

(v) = 0;

– if v ∈ TTn
angle between Df

f t1 (x) is such that the angle between v and Gf t1 (x) is bigger than α, then the

−t2
f t1 (x)v and Ff t1−t2 (x) is smaller than α (see Figure 12.4).

Proof of Lemma 12.12. This comes from Oseledets theorem and the hypotheses made on
the Lyapunov exponents of x, and in particular that their sum is strictly negative.

12.2 Transfer operators and physical measures

The aim of this section is to study the behaviour of the measures (f

∗
N)mλN for “small”
times m (recall that λN is the uniform measure on the grid EN). We will focus on the
case where f is a C1+α expanding map of the circle: a classical theorem asserts that in
this case, the map f has a single physical measure (which is also the SRB measure), that
we will denote by µ0 (see Theorem 12.17). In this setting, O.E. Lanford has stated the
following conjecture.
Conjecture 12.13 (Lanford). Let f : S1 → S1 be a generic C2 expanding map. Then the
convergence (f

N)m(λN) → µ0 holds for N, m both going to +∞, with log N (cid:28) m (cid:28) √

N.

∗

5. In particular, Lemma 12.9 can be obtained by considering a plane (P) containing both x and y and
taking a foliation of Rn by planes parallel to (P). The desired diﬀeomorphism is then deﬁned on each
leave by the time-ψ(t) of the Hamiltonian given in the proof of the lemma, with ψ is a smooth compactly
supported map on the space Rn/(P), equal to 1 in 0 and with small C1 norm.

12.2. Transfer operators and physical measures

In this section, we will prove a kind of weak version of this conjecture (Theo-

rem 12.15). We begin by some notations.

and satisfying log Nm > c0m, then the convergence (f

)m(λNm) → µ0 holds.

This theorem will be obtained by combining the classical result of convergence
of the pushforwards of any smooth measure towards the SRB measure µ0 (Theo-
∗
rem 12.17), together with the convergence of the discrete operators f
N to the Ruelle-
Perron-Frobenius operator (Theorem 12.19). Both of these theorems are eﬀective: the
constant c0 of Theorem 12.15 can be computed in practical.

We ﬁx once for all an expanding map f ∈ E 1+α

(S1), with 0 < α ≤ 1. In the sequel, we will

freely identify a measure with its density.

First of all, we recall an eﬀective result about the convergence of the pushforwards

of any smooth measure towards the SRB measure.

The transfer operator associated to the map f (usually called Ruelle-Perron-Frobe-
nius operator), which acts on densities of probability measures, will be denoted by Lf .
It is deﬁned by

Then, for every map φ ∈ Cα(S1) which is the density of a probability measure on S1,
f φ converges exponentially fast towards a map φ0 ∈ Cα(S1); this map is
the sequence L m
the density of the unique f -invariant probability measure µ0 having a Cα density. This
measure is also the unique SRB measure of f . More precisely, we have Theorem 12.17.
To state it, we will need the following notation.
Deﬁnition 12.16. For 0 < α ≤ 1 and g ∈ Cα(S1), we denote by [g]α the Hölder norm of
g, i.e.

|g(x)− g(y)|

such that for every m ≥ M,

Moreover, if φ is the constant function equal to 1, then M(φ) = 0.
This theorem is obtained by taking K = 2K0/(λα − 1) in the Theorem 10.1 of [FJ03]

(where K is deﬁned at the beginning of section 10 of [FJ03]).

We now come to the original part of the proof of Theorem 12.15, and compare the
actions of the transfer operator and of its discrete counterpart on smooth densities of
∗
measures. The discrete operator will be denoted by f
N; it acts on the probability mea-

This distance dLip spans the weak-* topology on P . Remark that by a theorem of
L. Kantorovich and G. Rubinstein, this distance coincides with Wasserstein distance
W1 (see [KR58]). Note that the distance between Lebesgue measure and the uniform
measure λN on EN is dLip(Leb, λN) = 1/(4N).

Notice that this theorem is only a partial answer to the Conjecture 12.13 of O.E. Lan-

ford. In particular, it does not answer to the following question.
Question. Let f : S1 → S1 be a generic C1+α expanding map. What is the best function
N)m(λN) → µ0 holds for N, m both going to +∞, with
∗
m(N) such that the convergence (f
log N (cid:28) m (cid:28) m(N)?

It is reasonable to think (see Conjecture 12.13) that m(N) ≤ √

N. Indeed, if σ : E → E
is a typical random map of a set E with q elements, and x is a typical point of E, then the
smallest integer m such that σm(x) ∈ Ω(σ) (recall that Ω(σ) is the union of the periodic
orbits of σ) is of order

q (see [Bol01, XIV.5] or the Theorem 2.3.1 of [Mie05]).

√

Notice that in Theorem 12.19, there is no hypothesis of genericity. We can hope that
the uniform distribution of the roundoﬀ errors of a generic map (see Proposition 9.2)
allows to have ﬁner results about the best function m(N).

We do not know what happens in the C1 generic case. It is possible that the be-
haviour is very diﬀerent from the C1+α case. Indeed, a theorem of J. Campbell and
A. Quas (see [CQ01]) asserts that a generic C1 expanding map of the circle has a single
physical measure, but that this measure is singular with respect to Lebesgue measure.
We could also imagine similar studies in more general settings. For example, we can
expect that the results on the circle generalize to C1+α expanding maps of the torus Tn,
with n ≥ 1. It could be less straightforward to have generalizations to Anosov diﬀeo-
morphisms of Tn: in this case, the transfer operator is quite diﬀerent from that used in
the case of expanding maps.

We now begin the proof of Theorem 12.19 by the easier case where the time m is

equal to 1.

S1 φ = 1. Let ε > 0 and f ∈ E 1+α

Proof of Lemma 12.21. Let φ be the Cα(S1) density of a probability measure on S1, i.e.
φ ≥ 0 and
. As f ∈ C1+α(S1), we can estimate its lack
of linearity on an interval depending on its length. This will allow us to estimate the
diﬀerence between Lf and fN on every interval based on the length of this interval. The
global diﬀerence between Lf and fN will be obtained by a summation on a partition of
S1 of intervals of appropriate length.

and for starting points x either equal to (1/2,1/2), or chosen at random. We present im-
ages of sizes 128× 128 pixels representing in logarithmic scale the density of the mea-
sures µfN
x : each pixel is coloured according to the measure carried by the set of points
of EN it covers. Blue corresponds to a pixel with very small measure and red to a pixel
with very high measure. Scales on the right of each image corresponds to the measure
of one pixel on the log10 scale: if green corresponds to −3, then a green pixel will have
measure 10
x . For information, when Lebesgue measure is represented, all the
pixels have a value about −4.2.
(cid:16)

We have carried out the simulations on three diﬀerent diﬀeomorphisms.
– The ﬁrst conservative diﬀeomorphism h1 is of the form h1 = Q ◦ P, where both P
and Q are homeomorphisms of the torus that modify only one coordinate:

periodic orbits with not too large periods. Note that h1 is also chosen so that it is
not C2-close to the identity.
– The second conservative diﬀeomorphism h2 is the composition h2 = h1 ◦ R, with
the translation of the torus

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

R(x, y) =

x + 1/10, y + 1/15

.

Again, for R, we have chosen a translation with a relatively small order (here 30)
to ensure that the discretizations can have periodic orbits with small periods.
– The third conservative diﬀeomorphism h3 is the composition h2 = h1 ◦ A, with A
the linear Anosov map

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

A =

2 1
1 1

.

As h1 is C1-close to Id, the diﬀeomorphism h3 is C0-conjugated to the linear auto-
morphism A, which is in particular ergodic.

To compute these measures, we used Floyd’s Algorithm (or the “tortoise and the hare
algorithm”). It has appeared that on the examples of diﬀeomorphisms we have tested,
we were able to test orders of discretization N (cid:39) 220. Thus, the ﬁrst ﬁgures represent
x for N ∈ (cid:126)220 +1,220 +9(cid:127). We have also computed the distance between
the measures µfN
the measure µfN
x and Lebesgue measure (see Figure 12.6). The distance we have chosen
is given by the formula

(1/2,1/2) depending
on N for h1 (left), h2 (middle) and h3 (right), on the grids EN with N = 220 + k, k =

In practice, we have computed an approximation of this quantity by summing only on
the k ∈ (cid:126)0,7(cid:127).

(h1)N
x

In the case of the diﬀeomorphism h1, which is close to the identity, we observe a
strong variation of the measure µ
depending on N (left of Figure 12.6 and Fig-
ure 12.7). More precisely, for 7 on the 9 orders of discretization represented, these
measures seems to be supported by a small curve; for N = 220 + 3, this measure seems
to be supported by a ﬁgure-8 curve, and for N = 220 + 5, the support of the measure is
(h1)N
quite complicated and looks like an interlaced curve. The fact that the measures µ
x
strongly depend on N reﬂects the behaviour predicted by Theorem 12.1: in theory, for a
generic C1 diﬀeomorphism, the measures µfN
x should accumulate on the whole set of f -
invariant measures; here we see that these measures strongly depend on N (moreover,
we can see on Figure 12.6 that on the orders of discretization we have tested, these mea-
sures are never close to Lebesgue measure). We have no satisfying explanation to the
speciﬁc shape of the supports of the measures. When we ﬁx the order of discretization
(h1)N
and make vary the starting point x, the behaviour is very similar: the measures µ
x
widely depend on the point x (see Figure 12.10). We also remark that increasing the
order of discretizations does not make the measures µ

evolve more smoothly.

The measures µ

(h1)N
vary less than the measures µ
x

(recall that h2 is a small per-
turbation of a rotation of order 30). For the 8 ﬁrst measures of the Figure 12.8, we obtain
a measure which is very close to Lebesgue measure. The fact that we obtain measures
closer to Lebesgue measures was predictable: the dynamics h2 is close to the rotation
R, whose orbits are better distributed in the torus than that of the identity. But for the
order N = 220+9, the measure we obtain is very diﬀerent from the previous one: its sup-
port seems quite close to a real orbit of R (of order 30), in particular this support covers
a very small proportion of T2. This is what is predicted by Theorem 12.1: at least some-
times, the measures µ
should not be close to Lebesgue measure. We observe exactly
this behaviour when we make simulations for more diﬀerent orders of discretization N
(middle of Figure 12.6): for two orders N between 220 + 1 and 220 + 100, the measure
is far away from Lebesgue measure. Remark that the same behaviour holds when we
ﬁx the order of discretization and make the point x vary (Figure 12.11); however, we
is close to a

periodic measure with small period” is smaller in the case of Figure 12.11 than in the

produce these simulations.

The behaviour of the measures µ

, where h3 is a small C1-perturbation of the
linear Anosov map A, is quite close to that of the the measures µ
(see Figure 12.9):
most of the time, these measures are close to Lebesgue measure, but for one order of
discretization N (here, N = 220 + 4), the measure becomes very diﬀerent from Lebesgue
measure (we can see on the right of Figure 12.6 that this phenomenon appears twice
when N ∈ (cid:126)220 + 1,220 + 100(cid:127)). The diﬀerence with the case of h2 is that here, the
“exceptional” measure is much better distributed than for h2 (the maximal measure of
a region of size 1/128×1/128 is close to 10
−1.5 for h2). The same
phenomenon holds when we ﬁx the order of discretization but change the starting point
x (see Figure 12.12), except that (as for f2) the number of apparition of measures that

are singular with respect to Lebesgue measure is smaller than in Figure 12.9. Again,
we think that this follows from the fact that the orders of discretizations tested are
bigger. In this case, the simulations suggest the following behaviour: when the order of
far away from
discretization N increases, the frequency of apparition of measures µ
Lebesgue measures tends to 0.
Recall that Addendum 12.2 states that if x is ﬁxed, then for a generic f ∈
Diﬀ1(T2,Leb), the measures µfN
x accumulate on the whole set of f -invariant measures,
but do not say anything about, for instance, the frequency of orders N such that µfN
x
is not close to Lebesgue measure. It is natural to think that this frequency depends a
lot on f ; for example that such N are very rare close to an Anosov diﬀeomorphism and
more frequent close to an “elliptic” dynamics like the identity. The results of numerical
simulations seem to conﬁrm this heuristic.

(for 17 over the 20 orders N = 223 + i, i = 0,··· ,19, all the 100 random draws we have

from Lebesgue measure, like what happens for N = 223 + 17 (bottom), where 99 over

the other random draw gives a measure a bit more singular with respect to Lebesgue
measure (bottom right).

We have also simulated the conservative diﬀeomorphism f6 = f5 ◦ A, with A the

standard Anosov automorphism

thus f6 is a small C1 perturbation of A; in particular the theory asserts that it is topologi-
cally conjugated to A. We can test whether this property can be observed on simulations
or not.

First of all, we present the results of the simulations of the size of the recurrent set
Ω((fi)N), the number of periodic orbits of (fi)N (middle) and the length of the largest
periodic orbit of (fi)N, for N = 128k and k going from 1 to 150 (Figure 12.13).

For f5, the cardinality of the recurrent set is clearly increasing; it looks as if it be-
haves like N ln N. Fact remains that this behaviour is very diﬀerent from the one we
observe for the simulations of the homeomorphisms f3 and f4 (which are conservative
homeomorphisms, which are respectively small C0 perturbations of Id and A, see Sec-
tion 5.8, and more precisely Figure 5.7). For its part, the evolution of the cardinality of
the recurrent set of f6 is much more erratic, and is quite similar to that observed in the
corresponding C0 case (top right of Figure 5.7). Anyway, the behaviours are completely
diﬀerent at the neighbourhood of the identity and of the linear automorphism A.

As for the cardinality of the recurrent set, the number of periodic orbits of (f5)N
is very smooth and seems to evolve linearly in N. Obviously, this behaviour is very
diﬀerent from the case of homeomorphisms; however, we have no explanation to this
“smooth” behaviour. In the neighbourhood of A, the number of periodic orbits (middle
right of Figure 12.13) seems to be uniformly bounded in N by 18. Again, this behaviour
is very similar to what happens to f4, which is a small C0 perturbation of A (Figure 5.7).
For now, we do not have explanation to this behaviour.

The maximal period of a periodic orbit of (f5)N evolves less smoothly then the num-
ber of periodic orbits. It is even quite similar to the corresponding C0 case (Figure 5.7).
The same holds in the neighbourhood of A for the diﬀeomorphism f6. Seemingly, the
maximal period of a periodic orbit of fN does not give a good criterion to test if a map
behaves like a C1 system or not.

For f5, the distance d(µfN

T2,Leb) is quite quickly smaller than 0.1, and oscillates be-
tween 0.05 and 0.1 from N = 128 × 30. It is not clear if in this case, the sequence of

measures (µfN
T2)N converge towards Lebesgue measure or not (while for the C0 pertur-
bation of the identity we have tested, it is clear that these measures do not converge
to anything, see Figure 5.8). The distance d(µfN
T2,Leb) even seem to increase slowly (in
average – there are a lot of oscillations) from N = 50 × 128. We have the same kind
of conclusion for f6: by looking at Figure 12.14, we can not decide if the sequence of
measures (µfN

T2) seem to tend to Lebesgue measure or not.

The behaviour of the computed invariant measures µ

, where f5 is a small C1
perturbation of the identity, is way smoother than in the C0 case (compare Figure 12.15
(f5)N
with Figure 5.9). Indeed, the measure µ
T2 has quickly a big component which is close

to Lebesgue measure: the images contain a lot of light blue. Thus, we could be tempted
to conclude that these measures converge to Lebesgue measure. However, there are still
little regions that have a big measure: in the example of Figure 12.15, it seems that there
are invariant curves that attract a lot of the points of the grid (as can also be observed
on Figure 12.7). We have no explanation to this phenomenon, and we do not know if it
still occurs when the order of discretization is very large.

For the discretizations of f6, the simulations on grids of size 2k × 2k might suggest
tend to Lebesgue measure (Figure 12.16). Actually, when we
that the measures µ
perform a lot of simulations, we realize that there are also big variations of the be-
haviour of the measures (Figure 12.17): the measure is often well distributed in the
torus, and sometimes quite singular with respect to Lebesgue measure (as it can be
seen in Figure 12.14). This behaviour is almost identical to that observed in the C0
case in the neighbourhood of A (see Figures 5.11 and 5.12, and also the corresponding
discussion).

12.3.3 The case of expanding maps

We now present the results of the numerical simulations we have conducted for
expanding maps of the circle. We have tested the following expanding map of degree 2:

f (x) = 2x + ε1 cos(2πx) + ε2 sin(6πx),

with ε1 = 0.12794356372 and ε2 = 0.00824735961.

We focus on the simulations of both measures (f

S1. Recall that the
former is simply the push-forward of the uniform measure on EN by the iterate f k
N of
the discretization. The latter is the measure supported by the union of periodic orbits
of fN, such that the total measure of a periodic orbit is equal to the size of its basin of
attraction.

N)kλN and µfN

Recall that as f is expanding and belongs to C2(S1), it has a single SRB measure,
that we denote by µ0. This measure can be computed quite easily using the Ruelle-
Perron-Frobenius transfer operator. In Figure 12.18, we have represented the distance

neither made the precise study of the discrepancy of a union of “independent” image
sets (what happens for maps of degree d ≥ 2), nor the application of the discrepancy to
the non-linear case.

We think that growth of the distance d(µ0, (f

Various factors influencing results

This thesis is devoted to the study of discretizations in several contexts (conserva-
tive or dissipative, continuous or diﬀerentiable dynamics, etc.) and according to several
viewpoints (combinatorics, topology, ergodic theory; study of a single discretization or
all discretizations, etc.). In this chapter, we discuss the inﬂuence of these factors on the
dynamics of discretizations. This summary seemed essential, as some statements con-
cerning similar issues can diﬀer from almost 150 pages in manuscript, simply because
they concern diﬀerent dynamics (see for example corollaries 5.9 et 10.4).

As in the introduction, we will consider the easy case where the phase space X is
the torus T2 = R2/Z2, endowed with Lebesgue measure Leb and uniform discretization
grids

.

The results we will present are in fact true in various more general contexts; we refer to
the relevant parts of the manuscript for the precise deﬁnitions of these contexts.

13.1 Speciﬁc system versus generic system

At the beginning of the introduction (page 11), we have seen that the dynamics of the
discretizations of a speciﬁc system – for example a linear Anosov torus automorphism
– can be very particular. Speciﬁcally, in the case of this example (see Figure 1.1 and
[Ghy94]), on one hand the discretizations are all bijective, and on the other hand there
is a very quick recurrence. We interpreted this as a consequence of a resonance between
the linear automorphism and the grids 1.

This contrasts with the results concerning discretizations of generic conservative
homeomorphisms obtained in this thesis. For example, let us recall Theorem II of the
introduction (Corollary 5.24 page 77).
Theorem XVIII. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb), the se-
quence (D(fN))N≥0 accumulates on the whole segment [0,1].

1. There is a similar phenomenon for the doubling map x (cid:55)→ 2x on the circle R/Z. When R/Z is
equipped with the grids EN = Z/N, if N is a power of 2, then the discretization fN has 0 as unique ﬁxed
point, which attracts all the points of the grid. If, instead, N is coprime with 2, then fN is a cyclic permu-
tation of the grid. In none of these cases the dynamics of the discretization does reﬂect the true dynamics
of x (cid:55)→ 2x.

291

292

Chapter 13. Various factors inﬂuencing results

In particular, there is a subsequence of discretizations having a recurrent set 2 with
cardinality arbitrarily small compared with the cardinality of the grid: an inﬁnite num-
ber of discretizations are highly non injective. Thus, the generic dynamical behaviour
of discretizations is very diﬀerent from that of some particular system.

Nevertheless, let us stress the fact that considering generic homeomorphisms once
grids are ﬁxed induces some resonance (although less marked than in the example
above) between the dynamics and the grid. Indeed, our results express that for a generic
conservative homeomorphism f , each part of the dynamics of f “resonates” with an in-
ﬁnite number of grids. For example, this is illustrated by Theorem V of the introduction
(Theorem 5.43 page 84).
Theorem XIX. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb), for any f -
invariant probability measure µ, there exists a subsequence (fNk)k of discretizations such that
fNk has a unique invariant measure µk, which tends to µ. In other words, for any f -invariant
probability measure µ, there is a sequence (Nk)k≥0 of integers such that for any x ∈ T2,

fNk
x

µ

−→
k→+∞ µ.

The same phenomenon occurs for generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphisms (but in
a weaker sense): see for example Theorem VI of introduction (Theorem 12.1 page 247).
Theorem XX. For a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(T2,Leb), for a generic
point x ∈ T2 (depending on f ) and any f -invariant measure µ, there exists a subsequence
(fNk)k such that

−→
k→+∞ µ.

Note also that many of the results about genericity, concerning abstract dynamics,
can be observed on concrete examples (see Section 13.8 for a more detailed discussion).

13.2 Conservative versus dissipative

Of course, it is possible to detect attractive open sets of a dissipative dynamics f on

its discretizations. This is a well-known property, also veriﬁed by pseudo-orbits.

In the case of a generic dissipative homomorphism, this convergence of the dynam-
ics of discretizations to that of the homeomorphism is generally observed on many
properties. For example, a fairly regular behaviour is observed when looking at the
combinatorial dynamics of discretizations of a generic dissipative homeomorphism;
among others, we have shown the following statement (Corollary 4.14 page 58).
Proposition XXI. For a generic dissipative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2), the rate of
injectivity Card

/ Card(EN) of fN tends to 0 when N goes to inﬁnity.

fN(EN)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

This trivially implies that thee degree of recurrence D(fN) = Card

/ Card(EN)
tends to 0. This result follows directly from a similar property of the original dynamics:
a generic dissipative homeomorphism f is totally singular, i.e. for every ε > 0, there ex-
ists an open set with Lebesgue measure bigger than 1−ε whose image by f has Lebesgue
measure less than ε (see [AA13] and Deﬁnition 4.1 page 52 of this manuscript).

Ω(fN)

From the ergodic point of view, the dynamics of discretizations also converges to
that of f . More precisely, we have shown the following result (Theorem 4.16 page 59).

2. Recall that the recurrent set is the union of periodic orbits.

13.2. Conservative versus dissipative
293
Theorem XXII. For a generic dissipative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2), the measures
µfN
T2 (deﬁned as the Cesàro limits of the pushforwards of uniform measure on EN by iterates of
fN) tend to µf
T2 (which is the Cesàro limit of pushforwards of Lebesgue measure by iterates of
f ).

Thus, for a generic dissipative homeomorphism, the “physical” dynamics of dis-
cretizations (i.e. the dynamics of an arbitrarily large proportion of grid points) con-
verges to the “physical” dynamics of the homeomorphism (i.e. the dynamics of almost
every point with respect to the Lebesgue measure). This was predictable, given that at
a certain scale, the dynamics of a generic dissipative homeomorphism is essentially a
dynamics of sinks.

In the conservative case, the behaviour of discretizations is much less regular. For
example, Theorem XVIII asserts that unlike the generic dissipative case, the degree of
recurrence of discretizations of a generic conservative homeomorphism accumulates on
all [0,1]. From the ergodic point of view, Theorem XIX says that any invariant measure
(and not just the physical ones) of a generic conservative homeomorphism is seen by an
inﬁnity of discretizations.

The diﬀerences between conservative and dissipative behaviours for generic home-
omorphisms can be summarized in the following moral. If we do not assume that the
homeomorphism preserves the Lebesgue measure, then the dynamics of discretizations
converges to the dynamics of the homeomorphism relative to Lebesgue measure. If,
however, we assume that the homeomorphism preserves Lebesgue measure, then the
whole dynamics of discretizations reﬂect all the possible dynamics of the homeomor-
phism (periodic orbit, compact invariant, invariant measure, rotation vector, etc.) and
not just that of almost every point for Lebesgue measure.

This big diﬀerence between the behaviour of discretizations in the conservative and
the dissipative cases seems rather speciﬁc to homeomorphisms: the case of the generic
C1-diﬀeomorphisms seems less contrasted. This is explained by the fact that every
chain-recurrence class of a generic dissipative homeomorphism is totally disconnected,
while for a generic C1-diﬀeomorphism they can be stably with nonempty interior. Over-
all, the results on the dynamics of discretizations that are valid for generic conservative
C1-diﬀeomorphisms are also true for generic dissipative C1-diﬀeomorphisms, as long
as one restricts to a chain-recurrent class. For example, we have shown the following
result (Corollary 10.4 page 214).
Proposition XXIII. If f ∈ Diﬀ1(T2,Leb) is a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism, then for
every ε > 0 and every N0 ∈ N, there exists N ≥ N0 such that fN has a ε-dense periodic orbit.
If f ∈ Diﬀ1(T2) is a generic dissipative diﬀeomorphism, then for every chain-recurrence
class K, every ε > 0 and every N0 ∈ N, there exists N ≥ N0 such that fN has a periodic orbit
which is ε-dense in K.

Thus, the behaviour of discretizations on a chain-recurrence class of a generic dis-
sipative diﬀeomorphism seems very similar to that observed on discretizations of a
generic conservative diﬀeomorphism. This can be imputed to the fact that real dy-
namics are themselves relatively close in this case.

Chapter 13. Various factors inﬂuencing results

13.3 Dimension 1 versus dimension ≥ 2

As one can imagine, the dynamics of discretizations of homeomorphisms in dimen-
sion 1 on the one hand, and in higher dimension in the other hand, are quite diﬀerent.
This reﬂects the fact that the dynamics themselves of such systems are very diﬀerent.

In dimension 1, the length of periodic cycles of discretizations has a uniform be-
haviour at +∞. For a generic circle homeomorphism – thus with rational rotation num-
ber ρ(f ) = p/q – the length of these periodic cycles is eventually constant equal to q
(Proposition XI page 27, due to T. Miernowski). However, in dimension bigger than 2,
an application of Baire theorem gives the following result.
Proposition XXIV. For a generic dissipative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2), for any m ∈
N, there exists a subsequence (fNk)k≥0 of discretizations such that for any k, fNk has at least
m periodic orbits, with pairwise distinct lengths.

For Cr circle diﬀeomorphisms, generic among those with irrational rotation number
– which corresponds more or less to the conservative case 3 in higher dimensions – The-
orem XIII (page 28) of T. Miernowski asserts that the common length qN(f ) of periodic
orbits of fN tends to +∞ as N goes to +∞, but arbitrarily slowly. In higher dimension,
the following result holds (obtained by combining proofs of Theorems 5.36 and 5.47
pages 82 and 89).
Theorem XXV. Let f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb) be a generic conservative homeomorphism. Then
for every m ∈ N, there exists pairwise distinct integers p1,··· , pm and a subsequence (fNk)k≥0
of discretizations such that the set of periods of periodic orbits of fNk is exactly {p1,··· , pm}.
In particular, for a generic conservative homeomorphism, there is a subsequence of
discretizations having a number of periodic orbits tending to +∞, and a subsequence of
discretizations whose periodic orbits have uniformly bounded lengths. These phenom-
ena are strongly opposed to what happens on the circle.

The dynamical behaviour of discretizations of a generic expanding circle map is
fairly close to that of a homeomorphism/diﬀeomorphism of a higher dimensional man-
ifold. Indeed, as for generic diﬀeomorphisms (see Theorem IV page 14 of the introduc-
tion), we have a result linking local and global behaviours of discretizations.
Theorem XXVI. For every r ≥ 1 and every generic Cr expanding circle map f , the rate of
injectivity τk(f )satisﬁes

τk(f ) =

Similarly, the ergodic behaviour of generic C1 expanding circle maps strongly re-
sembles that of a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism of the torus T2, as can be
seen in comparing Theorem 12.1 page 247 with Proposition 12.4 page 248.

The behaviour of generic homeomorphisms is often regarded as not very relevant
from a physical point of view: it is locally too complicated to represent a large class of
concrete systems. Despite this, the study of such dynamics is not without interest.

– Firstly, one gets results expressing what can happen when the considered system
is not very regular. This is what happens in our case: one sees phenomena high-
∞
-diﬀeomorphisms with large
lighted by the theory on quite simple examples of C
derivatives (see Figure 1.2 page 16).

– Secondly, the generic C0 dynamics are somehow toys models. Their study is a ﬁrst

step in understanding phenomena occurring in higher regularity.

– Finally, the evolution of the the properties of discretizations of generic systems
between regularities C0 and C1 can indicate what should happen in higher regu-
larities.

This thesis is not an exception to the rule: the results we obtain in C1 regularity
are much weaker than those obtained in C0 regularity.
Indeed, to prove genericity
results, the diﬃcult part is often to get density statements. The perturbation lemma
we use in C0 regularity (Proposition 3.3 page 44) has a relatively simple proof and
allows to perturb independently an arbitrary ﬁnite number of points of our space. For
now, such a result does not exist in regularity Cr for r ≥ 1; we only have partial results
in the case r = 1, called closing or connecting lemmas. These classical lemmas, whose
proofs are much harder than in the C0 case, allow us to transfer directly the results
one has about the global behaviour of discretizations of generic homeomorphisms, to
results concerning the behaviour of a sub-dynamics of discretizations of a generic C1-
diﬀeomorphism.

For example, one get the following statement (Corollary 5.9 page 72) for generic
conservative homeomorphisms, which is a slight improvement of Theorem I page 13 of
T. Miernowski.

Proposition XXVII. For a generic conservative torus homeomorphisms, there exists a sub-
sequence of discretizations which are cyclic permutations of the grids.

This theorem states that for a generic conservative homeomorphism and for every

ε > 0, an inﬁnite number of discretizations is topologically transitive at the scale ε.

For diﬀeomorphisms, applying the (hard) connecting lemma of C. Bonatti and
S. Crovisier [BC04], this theorem becomes the following statement (Corollary 10.4
page 214), which only concerns a small part of the point of the grid.
Proposition XXVIII. For a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(T2,Leb), for any
ε > 0, there exists a subsequence of discretizations having at least one ε-dense periodic orbit.

Note that the diﬀerence between Theorems XXVII and XXVIII is similar to the dif-

ference between Theorems XIX and XX.

The global behaviour of generic conservative diﬀeomorphisms is much more diﬃ-
cult to capture. We still get a result (with diﬃculty!) by considering a “semi-dynamic”
quantity (since decreasing with time): the degree of recurrence. If it accumulates on all
[0,1] for a generic conservative homeomorphism (Theorem XVIII), it tends to 0 for a
generic conservative diﬀeomorphism: let us recall Theorem III of Introduction (Theo-
rem 11.26 page 238).

The proof of this result concerning diﬀeomorphisms uses crucially the fact that they
possess diﬀerentials. It is based on an extensive study of the linear case (Part 2) and on
the formula linking the local and global behaviours of discretizations (Theorem 11.3
page 223, already stated in the introduction as Theorem IV).

where the rate of injectivity of a sequence of matrices is deﬁned similarly to that of a diﬀeo-
morphism (see Deﬁnition 7.19 page 146).

Note that there are open sets of C1-diﬀeomorphisms made of Anosov diﬀeomor-
phisms, which satisfy the shadowing lemma: if f is such a diﬀeomorphism, then for
every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that every δ-pseudo-orbit is ε-shadowed by a true
orbit of f . In particular, this lemma is veriﬁed by the orbits of all discretization on
a ﬁne enough grid. One would hope that this very strong property implies that the
dynamics of discretizations reﬂects that of the original diﬀeomorphism. The reality is
somewhat more complex. For example, we saw that the discretizations of Arnold’s cat
map – which is a well-known example of Anosov diﬀeomorphism – do not reﬂect at all
of the mixing properties of the dynamics. In this case, the dynamics of discretizations
only catches the periodic points of small periods (see Figure 1.1 page 11). This is due to
the fact that a priori, one knows nothing about the orbit that the pseudo-orbit tracks. It
can represent rather badly the global dynamics of the application.

Somehow, statements that are shown on the dynamics of discretizations of a generic
C1-diﬀeomorphism f express that every dynamical feature of f is shadowed by similar
behaviours of a sub-dynamics of some discretizations fNk (see for example Proposi-
tion XXVIII). The problem is that these results say nothing about the rest of the dynam-
ics of fNk. The good news is that if f satisﬁes the shadowing lemma, then it ensures that
the rest of the dynamics is not arbitrary: this dynamics is actually tracked by real orbits
of f .

Theorem XXIX also becomes interesting when compared to the corresponding case
in C0 regularity. It indicates that the bad behaviours observed for generic conservative
homeomorphisms should disappear in higher regularity: the behaviour of the rate of in-
jectivity is less irregular for generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphisms than for generic
conservative homeomorphisms (compare with Theorem XVIII). This big diﬀerence sug-
gests that the wild behaviours of the global dynamics of discretizations of generic con-
servative homeomorphisms observed in Chapter 5 may not appear in higher regulari-
ties. For example, contrary to what happens for generic conservative homeomorphisms,
one can hope recovering the physical measures of a generic C1 conservative diﬀeomor-
phism by looking at the measures µfN
x accumulate on
the whole set of f -invariant measures (Theorem XX). This behaviour is also suggested
by the numerical experiments we have conducted (see Subsection 12.3.2).

Finally, we have shown that in short time, the pushforwards of the uniform measure
on the grid by the discretizations of a smooth enough circle expanding map converge
towards a single measure, which is the SRB measure µ0 of the expanding map (µ0 is
also the unique absolutely continuous invariant measure). Speciﬁcally, the following
theorem holds (Theorem 12.15).

Theorem XXXI. For every α > 0 and every circle C1+α expanding map f , there exists a
constant c0 = c0(f ) > 0 such that if (Nm)m is a sequence of integers tending to inﬁnity but
such that ln Nm > c0m, then the following convergence holds

Observe that this result does not uses genericity. Note also that this theorem says
nothing about what happens in the case of generic C1 expanding maps: in this case,
the techniques used in the proof (i.e. the Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius transfer operator)
no longer work at all (and the behaviour of physical measures is very diﬀerent, see for
example [CQ01]).

13.5 One discretization versus most of the discretizations

versus all the discretizations

For generic conservative homeomorphisms, the philosophy of the results is not re-
ally the same whether one considers a single discretization or all discretizations 4. If one
looks at the dynamics of a single discretization, its behaviour wildly depends on the or-
der of the discretization, as expressed by the results of Section 5.3 of Chapter 5. For
example, for a generic conservative homeomorphism, there exists a constant P > 0 such
that the following properties are all satisﬁed by an inﬁnite number of discretization
orders N:

– fN is a cyclic permutation (Corollary 5.9 page 72);
– fN has a single cycle, which has period smaller than P; this cycle attracts all the

(cid:112)

points of the grid EN (Corollary 5.36 page 82);

– fN has at least

Card(EN) diﬀerent cycles (Corollary 5.22 page 77).

Worse, this variability of behaviours of discretizations persists if one tries to make
statistics on the frequency of appearance of the properties among the discretizations;
(see Section 5.4 of Chapter 5). For example, one shows the following result (Theorem
5.31 page 79 and Corollary 5.27 page 78).
Theorem XXXII. Let C be the set of N ∈ N such that fN is a cyclic permutation. Then,
for a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb), the sequence Card(C ∩
(cid:126)1, M(cid:127))/M accumulates on both 0 and 1.

Nevertheless, things are much better when considering the dynamics of all the dis-
cretizations of the homeomorphism: in this case, what emerges from the results proved
in Section 5.5 is that it is possible to detect many dynamical properties of the homeo-
morphism on discretizations. For example, one can detect the periodic orbits of f and
their periods (Theorem 5.36 page 82).

4. In this paragraph, we will not treat the dissipative case, since the dynamics of discretizations con-

verges uniformly to the dynamics of the starting homeomorphism.

298
Chapter 13. Various factors inﬂuencing results
Theorem XXXIII. Let f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb) be a generic conservative homeomorphism.
Then, for every f -periodic orbit ω of period p, and every δ > 0, there exists a subsequence
of discretization fNk such that for every k, fNk has a unique periodic orbit 5, of length p, and
which δ-shadows the orbit ω.

Similarly, Theorem XIX on invariant measures says that it is possible to retrieve all
the invariant measures of the original homeomorphism by looking at the invariant mea-
sures of all discretizations of this homeomorphism. In a way, these statements express
that the dynamics of the homeomorphism is tracked by that of its discretizations.

Concerning generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphisms, the results are yet too partial

to decide whether there is a convergence of the dynamics of discretizations or not.

On the one hand, one knows that some dynamical invariants of the diﬀeomor-
pihsm can be detected on a sub-dynamics of an inﬁnite number of discretizations. For
example, periodic orbits can be recovered from the discretizations (see Lemma 10.2
page 213).
Proposition XXXIV. Let f ∈ Diﬀ1(T2,Leb) be a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism.
Then, for every f -periodic orbit ω of period p, and every δ > 0, there exists a subsequence
of discretizations fNk such that for every k, fNk has at least one periodic orbit 6 of length p,
which δ-shadows the orbit ω.

Similarly, Theorem XX indicates that it is possible to retrieve invariant measures of
a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism (see also Corollary 10.9 for a proof of a simpler
result).

On the other hand the global behaviour of the discretizations is more regular than
in the C0 case, as emphasized by the fact that the degree of recurrence tends to 0 for a
generic conservative diﬀeomorphism (Theorem XXIX). Unfortunately, for now, no one
knows how to describe better the nature of the global dynamics of discretizations. For
example, we have no idea of how is the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of mea-

13.6 Combinatorial properties versus topological and ergodic

properties

As already seen, some combinatorial quantities associated to discretizations of a
generic conservative homeomorphism evolve very erratically depending on the order
of N discretization. For example, the degree of recurrence accumulates on all [0,1]
(Theorem XVIII), the lower limit of the number of periodic orbits is 1 (Theorem XXVII)
and its upper limit is +∞ (Theorem XXV, see also Corollary 5.22 page 77), etc. We
have even shown a general theorem in this sense: a property about ﬁnite maps of the
grids EN is dense if any conservative homeomorphism is arbitrarily well approximated
by ﬁnite maps with this property. Theorem 5.2 page 69 says that if a property is dense,
then it appears on an inﬁnite number of discretizations of a generic homeomorphism.

5. Thus this periodic orbit attracts all the points of the grid.
6. Remark that contrary to the C0 case, this orbit is in general not unique.

7. Recall that given a discretization fN, µ
T2 is deﬁned as the Cesàro limit of pushforwards by iterates
of fN of the uniform measure on the grid EN.

13.7. Microscopic versus mesoscopic versus macroscopic

√

So we can say that these combinatorial quantities are not very useful to detect the
dynamics of the initial application. Moreover, these results imply that the discretiza-
tions do not behave at all like a typical random map of a ﬁnite set: for example, such
a map σ : E → E, where E is a ﬁnite set with q elements, is such that the cardinality of
its recurrent set is of the order of
N (see [Bol01, XIV.5] or Theorem 2.3.1 of [Mie05]).
Worse, it is still not true when one considers for example the average of degree of re-
currence on long segments of discretization orders (see Theorem XXXII).

Regarding diﬀeomorphisms, we know very little about the global combinatorial
behaviour of discretizations. For this problem, the main theorem we get is Theo-
rem XXIX, which illustrates the fact that the discretizations of a generic conservative
C1-diﬀeomorphism behave diﬀerently from those of a generic conservative homeomor-
phism.

To recover the original dynamics, we have to use the geometry of the grids EN, and
focus on topological or ergodic properties of all discretizations. As already stated, both
in C0 and C1 topologies, this allows to recover for example the set of invariant measures
of the initial dynamics (TheoremsXIX and XX) or all periodic points (Theorem XXXIII
and PropositionXXXIV), or the rotation set, as shown by Theorem VII of Introduction
(Theorem 6.23 page 116).
Theorem XXXV. For a generic conservative homeomorphism f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb),

– the observable rotation set is reduced to a single point;
– the supremum limit of the rotation sets of discretizations coincides with the rotation set

of f .

13.7 Microscopic versus mesoscopic versus macroscopic

A generic homomorphism (conservative or dissipative) has a very chaotic local be-
haviour. For instance, when it has a periodic point of period p, then its set of periodic
points of period p is a Cantor set (so it is uncountable). Moreover, for any multiple of q
of p, the set of periodic points of period q is nonempty; and any periodic point of period
p is the limit of a sequence of periodic points of period q. This lack of local regularity
of the map makes the local behaviour of its discretizations also very chaotic. Moreover,
this local behaviour of discretizations strongly depends on the order of the discretiza-
tion. For example, a discretization is sometimes locally bijective (Proposition XXVII),
and sometimes locally highly non injective, as shown by the following result (Corol-
lary 5.20 page 76).
Theorem XXXVI. Let ϑ : N → R∗
conservative homeomorphsim f ∈ Homeo(T2,Leb), we have 8

Therefore, the local behaviour of a discretization of a generic conservative homo-
morphism is rather wild, and therefore somehow irrelevant. This is reﬂected at a tem-
poral level: for example, comparing Proposition XXVII and Theorem XXXVI, we see

8. Remark that this result is an improvement of the fact that the degree of recurrence of a generic

conservative homeomorphism accumulates on 0.

that discretizations of two (arbitrarily large) diﬀerent orders may have opposite be-
haviours from the ﬁrst iteration .

Things are quite diﬀerent for diﬀeomorphisms. The existence of (continuous) dif-
ferentials to a diﬀeomorphism f dictates the local behaviour of its discretizations. This
is illustrated by Theorem XXX, which expresses that generically, a time t being ﬁxed,
for large enough discretization orders, the cardinalities of the images of the grid by the
discretizations in time smaller than t is determined by the diﬀerentials of f . There are
therefore three diﬀerent space scales:

– Firstly, at the scale of the torus – the macroscopic scale – in ﬁnite time, and for
large enough orders of discretization, the dynamics of the discretizations resem-
bles that of the original diﬀeomorphism.

– Secondly, at the scale of the diﬀerentials of f – the mesoscopic scale – one per-
ceive the action of derivatives of f . In ﬁnite time, and for large enough orders of
discretization, the dynamics of the discretizations resembles that of a sequence of
matrices.

– Finally, at the scale of the grid – the microscopic scale – we are able to see the

points of the grids, the “atoms”.

As for homeomorphisms, these spatial scales are transposed to temporal level. Here,
having an additional mesoscopic scale induces a transitional regime for the local be-
haviour of discretizations, as expressed by Theorem XXX (which is not really a purely
dynamical statement because it concerns only a ﬁnite number of iterations). To derive
an asymptotic result we then use the decreasing of the rate of injectivity over time.

Thus, to study the dynamics of diﬀeomorphisms, we are led to consider the dynam-
ics of discretizations of sequences of linear maps. Speciﬁcally, the discretization of a

13.8. In theory versus in practice

301

matrix A ∈ GL2(R) is the map(cid:98)A = P ◦ A|Z2, where P is a projection of R2 on the clos-
est point of Z2. We want to study the sets ((cid:99)AK ◦ ··· ◦(cid:99)A1)(Zn) for a generic 9 sequence

of matrices (Ak)k≥1 (possibly with determinant 1). One can see in Figure 13.1 typical
images of the image sets obtained. Among others, we can observe a phenomenon of
almost-periodicity of the ﬁrsts sets. Indeed, we prove that this is the case in any time 10
(Theorem 7.12). Roughly speaking, a set Γ is almost periodic if for R large enough, the
set B(0, R)∩ Γ determines the set Γ up to a set density of less than ε (see Deﬁnition 7.3
Theorem XXXVII. For any sequence (Ak)k≥1 of invertible matrices, the sets ((cid:99)Ak◦···◦(cid:99)A1)(Zn)
page 138).

are almost periodic.

Observing Figure 13.1, we also remark that the density of the image sets seems to
decrease with time. This behaviour is explained by the main theorem of Part 2 (Theo-
rem 8.24 page 171).
Theorem XXXVIII. For a generic sequence (Ak)k≥1 of matrices with determinant 1, the

density of the sets ((cid:99)Ak ◦···◦(cid:99)A1)(Zn) tends to 0 as k tends to +∞.

The proof of this theorem, which is quite long and diﬃcult, is mainly based on
arguments of equidistribution, which allow to reduce the computation of the density of
image sets (which is not very practical to handle, in particular it is nonlinear) to that of
the area of an intersection of cubes in high dimensions.

13.8 In theory versus in practice

For each context

(homeomorphisms and C1-
diﬀeomorphisms, both dissipative as conservative), we have compared the statements
obtained with the results of numerical simulations carried out on examples supposed
to represent the generic case.

studied in this manuscript

Let us start with the case of conservative homeomorphisms. At ﬁrst glance, simu-
lations of quantities such as the degree of recurrence can be seen as disappointing: in
practice, the degree of recurrence does not accumulate on all [0,1], but tends to 0 rel-
atively quickly (see Figure 13.2, see also Section 5.8). This contradicts the conclusions
of Theorem XVIII: in practice, the behaviour described by the statements regarding the
generic case cannot be observed in practice, even when the deﬁnition of the map is
made to mimic the generic case.

To observe in practice the phenomena predicted by theoretical results, one has to
stop looking at the combinatorial dynamics of discretizations. For example, we have
simulated the measures µfN
T2 (recall that they are the Cesàro limits of pushing forwards
of the uniform measure on EN by the iterates of fN). In practice, it can not really be
expected that the measures µfN
T2 converge towards all invariant measures of f , because
this set is an inﬁnite dimensional convex set. Nevertheless, one can determine whether
these measures seem to converge or not. In Figure 1.2 page 16, we see that the measures
µfN
T2 do not converge at all towards Lebesgue measure, but in addition they have nothing
to do with each other, even when the discretization orders are very close. As predicted

by Theorem XIX, we do not recover the physical measure of the initial homeomorphism
on discretizations.

For dissipative homomorphisms, we also have simulated the measures µfN

T2 on two
diﬀerent examples. The ﬁrst one is a dissipative homeomorphism close to identity, but
with small sinks (see Figure 13.3, see also Section 4.3). It turns out that the behaviour of
these measures is identical to that observed in the conservative case: it does not detect
the dissipative nature of the dynamics at all. This had already been pointed out by
J.-M. Gambaudo and C. Tresser in [GT83]: if the sinks are too small – this can happen
quite easily, even if the deﬁnition of the application is rather simple – then they are not
detected by simulations.

To avoid this phenomenon, we have also tested an example of dissipative homeo-
morphism close to identity, but having much larger sinks (see Figure 13.4, see also Sec-
tion 4.3). In this case, as predicted by Theorem XXII, the measures µfN
T2 seem to converge

rather quickly to a measure supported by the attractive sets of the homeomorphism.

orems can change dramatically depending on the considered type of dynamics. For ex-
ample, Figure 13.5 illustrates Theorem XX, which expresses that in some cases (in fact,

diﬀeomorphisms (see Section 12.3 for precise deﬁnitions). For the ﬁrst diﬀeomorphism,
which is close to an “elliptical” dynamics – namely identity –, this distance is still quite
high: the obtained measure is always far away from Lebesgue measure (see Figure 1.3
page 16). The second tested diﬀeomorphism is a small C1-perturbation of a transla-
tion of order 30 of the torus. In this case, the measure is almost always very close to
Lebesgue measure, except for some few orders N, where it is quite far away. The third
diﬀeomorphism is a small C1-perturbation of a linear Anosov automorphism. Again,
the calculated measure is almost always very close to Lebesgue measure, except for
some few orders N (although this is less marked than for the second diﬀeomorphism).
As could be expected, it seems that in practice, the more the initial dynamics is chaotic,
the less there are orders of discretization for which the conclusions of the obtained
statements are true.

14.1 Combinatorial dynamics of discretizations of generic

diﬀeomorphisms

So far, we know very little about the combinatorial dynamics of discretizations of
generic conservative diﬀeomorphisms. As already said, we know that the degree of
recurrence tends to 0 (Theorem XXIX), but it is actually the only result we have about
the global behaviour of discretizations. We still do not know answer simple questions
such as the following.

Question. Does the cardinality of the recurrent set of discretizations fN of a generic conser-
vative diﬀeomorphism f goes to inﬁnity when N goes to inﬁnity? If so, do the length of the
longest periodic orbit of fN, or the number of periodic orbits of fN, tend to inﬁnity?

The next step would be to determine whether discretizations of generic diﬀeomor-
phisms behave like random maps (see Section 14.8). This kind of questions seems to
me out of reach for the moment.

14.2 Convergence of canonical invariant measures

We still do not know the behaviour of the “canonical” invariant measures µfN

T2 of
fN when f is a generic conservative C1-diﬀeomorphism. Recall that each of these mea-
sures µfN
T2 is supported by the recurrent set of fN; the total measure of each periodic orbit
being proportional to the size of its basin of attraction. In the case of generic conser-
vative homeomorphisms, these measures accumulate on all f -invariant measures (The-
orem XIX). On the contrary, in the case of generic dissipative homeomorphisms, they
converge towards a single measure (Theorem XXII). In the case of generic conservative
diﬀeomorphisms, their behaviour is so far not known.
Question. For a generic conservative diﬀeomorphism f ∈ Diﬀ1(T2,Leb), do the measures
µfN
T2 tend to Lebesgue measure? Do they accumulate on the whole set of f -invariant measures?

The numerical simulations we present do not allow us to guess an answer to this
question (see Figure 12.15). If such measures are much closer to Lebesgue measure that
in the C0 case, one still observe small regions of the torus with large measure.

14.3 Detection of some dynamical properties

In this manuscript, we do not address the detection of a number of dynamic invari-
ants. For example, our techniques provide no way to determine whether a dynamics
is transitive or not. In fact, the systems studied are very speciﬁc: a generic dissipative
homeomorphism is never transitive, while a generic conservative homeomorphism – or
C1-diﬀeomorphism – is always. We could also try to detect the conservativeness of a
dynamics. Unfortunately, we have no algorithm to answer this type of question. We do
not know either how to answer questions like the following.

Question. If for every ε > 0, an inﬁnite number of discretizations has a ε-dense periodic
orbit, does it imply that the initial dynamics is transitive?

A classical problem in dynamics is the eﬀective calculation of entropy or Lyapunov
exponents of a system. The results obtained in this thesis do not provide answers to such
questions, which are only relevant in the case of generic diﬀeomorphisms (for a generic
conservative homeomorphism, the metric entropy is zero and topological entropy is
inﬁnite). We just can have a lower bound (possibly very bad) of the topological entropy
of a conservative diﬀeomorphism of the torus with the calculation of its rotation set
(with the bounds obtained by J. Kwapisz in [Kwa93]).

Question. Only knowing the dynamics of discretizations, is it possible to calculate the en-
tropy of the initial system?

To handle this problem, the best method is probably not looking at the dynamics
of discretizations, that is to say, looking at the behaviour of discretizations “in inﬁnite
time”. It may be more eﬃcient to stop computations at a well chosen time, presumably
logarithmic in N (see next section).

14.4 Explicit estimations about convergence of dynamics

One of the shortcomings of the results presented in this manuscript is their lack of
eﬀectiveness (using Baire theorem, we use countable axiom of choice). For example,
when obtaining results of simulations of rotation sets using coarse discretizations (e.g.
Figure 1.4 page 18), there is no theoretical result estimating whether the obtained sets
are close to true rotation set or not. It would probably be quite easy to have estimates
such as “for δ > 0, there exists an explicit N0 > 0 such that if the grid order is bigger
than N0, then the rotation set of the discretization is contained in the δ-neighbourhood
of the real rotation set”. By cons, there is currently no way to know when the rotation

14.5. Diﬀerent notions notions of genericity

307

set of the discretization “ﬁlls” the rotation set of the homeomorphism. One can only
get an indication of the convergence when the obtained sets seem to stabilize; however
this does not ensure that the simulated rotation set is actually close to the rotation set
of the homeomorphism. It would be very interesting to be able to provide answers to
the following question.

Question. Is it possible to ﬁnd a reasonably fast algorithm of approximation of the rotation
set, such that there are rigorous estimates of the distance between the calculated and the actual
rotation set, depending on the parameters of the problem?

14.5 Diﬀerent notions notions of genericity

In this thesis, we discuss results of genericity in only two speciﬁc cases: the C0
and C1 topologies. One could imagine study what happens in diﬀerent contexts. One
could of course be interested in what happens in the intermediate case of Hölder generic
applications. It would also be natural to look at what happens in Cr topology, with r > 1,
r = ∞ or r = ω (real analytic applications). However, the results we obtained are rather
partial in C1 topology, it may be very diﬃcult to have satisfactory statements in these
more rigid contexts.

In this manuscript, we distinguish the behaviours of discretizations of conservative
and dissipative generic systems. One could imagine studying what happens to other
types of dynamics like generic chain-transitive homeomorphisms 1.

There are other concepts of genericity than that of Baire. For example, prevalence,
which is supposed to be closer to the concept of full measure set. In this direction, part
of the article [Mie06] of T. Miernowski about discretizations of circle diﬀeomorphisms
focuses on prevalent diﬀeomorphisms.

The most most natural idea for the study of discretizations is perhaps that of Kol-
mogorov genericity: for a function f given by an explicit formula, the Kolmogorov com-
plexity describes the number of elementary operations needed to calculate the images
f (x). Indeed, to make numerical simulations, one has necessarily an explicit expression
of the evolution law; so we want a notion of genericity for maps deﬁnable by a formula.
One can then ask the following question.

Question. What are the properties of discretizations of most of the functions with Kol-
mogorov complexity less than a given number?

This problem seems far too complex to get satisfactory answers in the short term.
Note that some properties we got are true on open and dense sets of applications.
For example, for every τ0 > 0, the property “limt→+∞ τt(f ) ≤ τ0” is satisﬁed on an open
and dense subset of conservative C1-diﬀeomorphisms.
In this case, the concepts of
genericity and prevalence more or less coincide.

14.6 Generic behaviours among conjugates to a given system

Finally, one may wonder what happens when one ﬁxes a dynamics f , and considers
its discretizations over a generic sequence of grids. A partial answer to this question

1. For a study of the dynamics of generic chain-transitive continuous maps (necessarily homeomor-
phisms), see the book of E. Akin [Aki99]. It is possible that the techniques presented there can be used for
the study of discretizations of such applications.

308

Chapter 14. Research directions

is given in Section 5.7 of Chapter 5: if we consider a conservative homeomorphism f ,
and if “generic sequence of grids” means “image of a ﬁxed good sequence of grids by a
generic conservative homeomorphism”, then it happens exactly the same as for generic
conservative homeomorphisms with respect to a ﬁxed sequence of grids, provided that
the ﬁxed points set of f has empty interior.
It would be interesting to know what
happens in other cases, in particular to have answers to the following question.

Question. A homomorphism f being ﬁxed, if we consider discretizations of f with respect
to the image of a sequence of grids by a generic conservative homeomorphism, is it possible to
retrieve the classes of recurrence by chains of f , or even better, the transition graph between
recurrence classes? What about a practical point of view? What happens on each recurrence
class?

14.7 Characteristic time

In general, when a computer is asked to calculate the orbit of a point x by a map f , it
works in double precision, with 52 binary digits. If one digitally iterates f a reasonable
number of times t, it is very unlikely that the orbit of x falls into a periodic orbit of
< t such that
the discretization in time smaller than t, that is that there is a time t
(cid:48)
f t
N (xN) = f t
is
typically of the order of 84 million (see e.g. Theorem 2.3.1 of [Mie05]). However, the
results obtained in this manuscript concern precisely this recurring event; so a priori
they cannot explain what happens in practice.

N(xN). Indeed, for a random map of a set with 252 elements, this time t

stabilisation time

The timeline above concerns the temporal behaviour of a given discretization fN. It
shows a time t1 corresponding to the time up to which the orbit of any starting point
x under fN shadows that of x under f . The theoretical estimates we have for the time
up to which there is a “strong shadowing” are rather bad. For example, if the map f is
Lipschitz, this time t1 is logarithmic in the size of the grid. In practice, when performing
simulations, one iterate much longer than this usually rather short time. The time t2 is
the stabilization time of fN, that is to say the time from which the orbit of any point on
the grid fall into the recurrent set of fN. From this time, the dynamics of fN is strictly
periodic; one can consider that it is only from t2 that the dynamics of the discretization
emerges.

This leaves a long time interval [t1, t2] where we do not really know how evolve the

discretizations.

In this manuscript, we are interested primarily in the dynamics of discretizations.
The ﬁnite time behavior of discretizations has already been studied by P.P. Flockermann
(see Section 2.4).
It would be extremely interesting to determine an “intermediate”
characteristic time t1 (cid:28) t
(cid:28) t2, until where we see for sure the dynamics of the initial
map, without suﬀering recurrence phenomena induced by the discretizations. In this
subject, O.E. Lanford has stated the following conjecture.

N.

In this manuscript, we prove a theorem in this sense (see Theorem XXXI) but unfor-
tunately this only concerns times ln N = O(k). I hope that the techniques presented in
Chapter 9 will allow to get more results in the direction of this conjecture.

14.8 Comparison with random maps

In this thesis, we (almost) do not compare the dynamics of discretizations with that
of a typical random map of a set with q elements. Here, “typical” means the following.
An integer q being ﬁxed, one considers all maps from a set with q elements into itself;
this ﬁnite set is endowed with the uniform probability. One then wonders what prop-
erties are satisﬁed by most of these applications. This type of questions was studied by
(among others) P. Erdős and P. Turán (see for example [ET65] and [ET67]), an overview
of these results can be found in [Bol01]. For example, the degree of recurrence of such
applications (recall that the degree of recurrence is the ratio between the cardinality
−1/2. Of course, the study we have conducted
of the recurrent set and q) behaves like q
in the case of discretizations of generic conservative homeomorphisms shows that such
discretizations do not behave at all like random maps, even from an experimental point
of view. By cons, what happens to discretizations of Cr-diﬀeomorphisms, with r ≥ 1, is
not clear at all. Unfortunately, the precise study of the combinatorics of such discretiza-
tions seems for the moment out of reach.

14.9 Spatial discretizations versus stochastic perturbations

versus multivalued maps

In this manuscript, we do not treat the problems of stochastic perturbations or mul-

tivalued discretizations.

The ﬁrst problem is the following: consider a dynamics f , and look at the sequences
(xk)k≥0, where xk+1 is obtained by taking a small random perturbation of f (xk). This
idea of “small random perturbation” can be formalized in many ways, for example one
can choose to take the image of xk by a map randomly chosen from those that are close to
f , or take a point randomly in a neighbourhood of f (xk), etc. The reader could consult
the lecture notes [Via97] of M. Viana to get an idea of the variety of results in this area
(e.g. in the case of expanding maps [Kif86a],[Kif86b], [Kel82], or uniformly hyperbolic
maps [Kif86b], [You86], etc.).

In general, these results need the dynamics to be quite regular (typically at least
C1+α): a conventional method to get them is to use some transfer operators related to
the dynamics. They all suggest that the physical dynamics of stochastic perturbations
converges towards the physical dynamics of the initial map. As already said, what
happens for discretizations of generic systems is really diﬀerent: after a while, the or-
bit of each point of the grid falls into a periodic orbit. This recurring phenomenon
destroys any hope that the discretizations behave like stochastic perturbations during
long time scales. This may aﬀect the ergodic dynamics of discretizations, as there is no
uniform convergence in Birkhoﬀ theorem. This does not prevent the discretizations of
some dynamics being close stochastic perturbations in the short term, as explained by

310

Chapter 14. Research directions

P.P. Flockermann in his thesis [Flo02] in the case of circle expanding maps. However,
P.P. Flockermann does not get any practical estimate on how long this behaviour is true.

Question. How long the discretizations of generic circle expanding maps on the circle, or
generic diﬀeomorphisms, behave like stochastic perturbations?

In this manuscript, we do not treat either approximation of the dynamics by mul-
tivalued maps. This viewpoint can be quite interesting to determine which dynamical
properties of a system can be detected by considering discrete approximations of the
dynamics, see for instance [LP11] (see also [Mro96] et [DKP96]). A priori, approaching
a dynamics by a multivalued map, one lose much less information than approaching it
by a ﬁnite map. Despite this, for generic conservative homeomorphisms, we show that
in fact we can retrieve every dynamical feature of the system by considering all its dis-
cretizations (see for example Theorem XIX). Therefore, in theory, one does not lose more
information in discretizing than in considering multivalued maps. In fact, in Chapter 5,
one implicitly uses multivalued maps: the proof of Lax theorem consists in extracting
an actual map from a multivalued map. The rest of Chapter 5 uses the same type of
arguments: the candidates for discretizations are contained in a multivalued map; then
Baire theorem allows us to choose among all possible extractions those with properties
that one wants to see appearing an inﬁnite number of times on discretizations.

However, in the case of multivalued maps, it may be possible to get actual estimates
of the order of discretization up to which we have to go to be able to retrieve dynam-
ical invariants with a given accuracy. This is clearly not the case for discretizations of
generic systems, at least with the methods used in this thesis. Note that the fact of con-
sidering multivalued maps poses additional practical problems: for example, it is much
longer to digitally detect the cycles for a multivalued map than for a classical map.
