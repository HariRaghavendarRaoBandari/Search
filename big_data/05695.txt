ABSTRACT
OH megamasers (OHMs) are rare, luminous molecular masers that are typically observed in
(ultra) luminous infrared galaxies and serve as markers of major galaxy mergers. In blind
emission line surveys such as the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (AL-
FALFA) survey for neutral hydrogen (H i), OHMs at z∼0.2 can mimic z∼0.05 H i lines. We
present the results of optical spectroscopy of ambiguous H i detections in the ALFALFA 40%
data release detected by the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) but with uncertain
optical counterparts. The optical redshifts, obtained from observations at the Apache Point
Observatory, revealed ﬁve new OHMs and identiﬁed 129 H i optical counterparts. Sixty can-
didates remain ambiguous. The new OHMs are the ﬁrst detected in a blind spectral line survey.
The number of OHMs in ALFALFA is consistent with predictions from the OH luminos-
ity function. Additionally, the mid-infrared magnitudes and colors of the OHM host galaxies
found in a blind survey do not seem to diﬀer from those found in previous targeted surveys.
This validates the methods used in previous IR-selected OHM surveys and indicates there is
no previously unknown OHM-producing population at z∼0.2. We also provide a method for
future surveys to separate OH megamasers from 99% of H i line emitters without optical spec-
troscopy by using WISE infrared colors and magnitudes. Since the fraction of OHMs found
in ﬂux-limited H i surveys is expected to increase with the survey’s redshift, this selection
method can be applied to future ﬂux-limited high-redshift hydrogen surveys.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst hydroxyl megamaser
(OHM) was discovered by
Baan, Wood, & Haschick (1982) in Arp 220. The luminosity of
the galaxy’s OH emission line exceeded 103L⊙ (orders of mag-
nitude more luminous than known galactic OH masers), lead-
ing to the rise of the term ‘megamaser’ to describe masers with
isotropic line luminosities in the range 101−4L⊙. Early OHM sur-
veys such as Baan, Haschick, & Schmelz (1985) focused on galax-
ies with bright radio continuum and found <20 OHMs. After
the launch of IRAS, surveys such as Stavely-Smith et al. (1992)
and Norris, Gardner, & Whiteoak (1998) used IR properties to
select ULIRG-like candidates with ﬂat far-IR spectral
indices
and steep mid-IR spectral indices; these surveys discovered ∼30
OHMs. Darling & Giovanelli (2000), Darling & Giovanelli (2001),
and Darling & Giovanelli (2002a) (hereafter the Arecibo Mega-
maser Survey) carried out a deep survey using IR selection crite-

ria that roughly doubled the number of known OHMs. There are
∼110 known OHMs up to z = 0.264, most of which are listed in
Darling & Giovanelli (2002a).

All known OHMs are found in (ultra) luminous infrared galax-
ies ([U]LIRGs), extreme starburst galaxies that are almost exclu-
sively the products of major galaxy mergers (Clements et al. 1996).
Merger phase is correlated with the far infrared (FIR) luminosity of
ULIRGs, and the OHM fraction in ULIRGs is a strong function of
the FIR luminosity (Baan, Salzer & LeWinter 1998); this suggests
that the presence of an OHM in a ULIRG indicates the phase of the
merger. OHMs are also associated with high dense molecular gas
fractions (Darling 2007), further indicating their relation to merger
phase. Because OHMs are observable at large distances, they could
provide a useful tracer of the galaxy merger rate as a function of
redshift. Zeeman splitting of the OH line has also been observed in
several OHMs (Robishaw, Quataert, & Heiles 2008), allowing for
direct measurement of magnetic ﬁelds in star-forming regions.

While OHMs are interesting in their own right, they can also
contaminate in blind emission line surveys for neutral hydrogen

(H i). If νH i,0/(1 + zH i) = νOH,0/(1 + zOH), OH and H i lines appear at
the same frequency and OHMs can be mis-identiﬁed as H i sources.
While the fraction of OHMs in low-redshift H i surveys is small,
this fraction is expected to increase with redshift and reach 50% by
z = 1 (Briggs 1998). It is therefore necessary to develop a method
to separate OH and H i lines in blind spectral line surveys before
the advent of high-redshift H i surveys (e.g. ASKAP, Johnston et al.
2008).

In this work, we present the ﬁrst OHMs detected in a blind
spectral line survey. Five new OHMs at 0.167 ≤ zOH ≤ 0.244
were detected in the 40% data release of the Arecibo Legacy
Fast Arecibo L-Band Feed Array Survey (ALFALFA, Haynes et al.
2011), a blind emission line survey for H i at z ≤ 0.06. After con-
ﬁrming that the number and IR properties of these OHMs match
empirical predictions, we develop a method to separate OH from
H i lines without the use of optical spectroscopy.

Throughout this work, we assume a ΛCDM cosmology with
Ωm = 0.29, ΩΛ = 0.71, and H0 = 70km s−1 Mpc−1 (Hinshaw et al.
2013).

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

We identiﬁed a total of 194 objects as potential OHMs by selecting
objects from the ALFALFA 40% data release (Haynes et al. 2011)
that had no optical counterpart velocity or an optical velocity that
diﬀered from the HI velocity by more than 300 km s−1. We rejected
large spiral galaxies that are clearly HI emitters. When more than
one possible optical counterpart fell within the ALFALFA position
ellipse, we selected the closest WISE mid-IR counterpart detected
at 22 µm for optical spectroscopy.

We observed candidate OHMs at the Apache Point Observa-
tory over 15 sessions between December 2011 and March 2013.
Observations were made using the Dual Imaging Spectrograph at
the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5 m telescope with the
B400/R300 grating and a 1.5" spectroscopic slit. This setup has a
dichroic wavelength of ∼5350 Å and a resolving power of R∼3250
on the red side and R∼2400 on the blue side. Most targets had 2-4
observed frames, for a total exposure time of 5-20 minutes for typi-
cal objects and 1-2 hours for the faintest targets. Calibration images
included bias frames, quartz lamp ﬂat ﬁeld frames, and spectra of
helium, neon, and argon arc lamps for wavelength calibration.

Data reduction followed standard procedures for the IRAF
‘longslit’ package. Upper bounds for the pixel-Å axis transforma-
tion uncertainty were 4 km s−1 on the red side and 21 km s−1 on
the blue side. We adjusted the wavelength solution to heliocentric
velocity using ‘rvcorrect’ and ‘dopcor’; this process added around
1 km s−1 of uncertainty in the wavelength solutions. Upper bounds
for the wavelength calibration uncertainty were 125 km s−1 on the
blue side and 92 km s−1 on the red side. After calibration, we
aligned and median stacked exposures of the same science target.
We made line measurements using the IRAF ‘splot’ task. The
red side of the spectrum usually showed Hα (6563 Å) bracketed
by two [NII] lines (6549 and 6583 Å), with a [SII] doublet (6717
and 6731 Å) on the redward side. On the blue side, the most com-
mon lines were Hβ (4861 Å) and two [OIII] lines (5007 and 4959
Å). We also commonly observed other lines in the Balmer series of
hydrogen as well as the 3727 Å [OII] line on the blue side. Most
objects had at least 5-7 observed optical lines, with 9 lines com-
mon. Only in a few cases were fewer than 5 lines observed. We
measured RMS noise for each target in clean regions of the spec-
trum, away from astronomical sources, night sky lines, and cosmic

rays. We calculated ﬁnal redshifts using an error-weighted average
of the individual line measurements. The typical ﬁnal uncertainty
in redshift was 2 × 10−6, or 0.6 km s−1. The maximum centroid
uncertainty observed was 5.4 × 10−5, or 16 km s−1.

Typical and maximum values for all factors contributing to the
the ﬁnal uncertainty in measured velocities are: instrumental uncer-
tainty, 112 km s−1 typical and 125 km s−1 maximum; wavelength
calibration, 13 km s−1 typical and 21 km s−1 maximum; heliocen-
tric calibration, 1 km s−1 maximum; and line centroid uncertainty,
1 km s−1 typical and 16 km s−1 maximum. Adding these uncertain-
ties in quadrature, we arrive at 113 km s−1 typical uncertainty and
128 km s−1 maximum uncertainty. We thus conservatively adopt
130 km s−1 as the uncertainty on all optical recession velocity mea-
surements.

3 RESULTS

For each observation, we could make one of three determinations.
The ﬁrst, and most common, was that the velocity of the observed
object matched (within uncertainty) the velocity listed in the AL-
FALFA catalog. It was also possible for the object’s velocity to
match the OH velocity, found by recalculating the velocity in the
ALFALFA catalog using an OH rest frequency instead of an H i rest
frequency:

zOH =

νOH,0
νH i,0

(1 + zH i) − 1,

(1)

where zi = vi/c and we adopt a frequency of 1667.35903 MHz for
OH and 1420.405752 MHz for H i. These objects are OHMs. The
third possible outcome was ambiguous, where the observed veloc-
ity matched neither the H i nor the OH velocity. These ambiguous
cases are observations of the incorrect optical counterpart or of a
false positive ALFALFA detection.

3.1 OH Detections

We identiﬁed ﬁve previously undiscovered OHMs through APO
observations. Additionally, Haynes et al. (2011) identiﬁed one pre-
viously discovered OHM (AGC 181310, IRAS 08201+2801, dis-
covered by Darling & Giovanelli 2001) in the ALFALFA α.40 re-
lease. These six objects are the only known OHMs in the AL-
FALFA α.40 database. Extrapolating to the full sample size indi-
cates ALFALFA will detect on the order of 15 total new OHMs,
slightly lower than Giovanelli et al. (2005) predictions that the sur-
vey ‘should detect several additional dozen OHMs.’ Table 1 lists
the optical, OH, and H i velocities for the six ALFALFA OHMs
as well as the line peak and width from ALFALFA (Haynes et al.
2011). ALFALFA extracts line peaks and widths using a matched-
ﬁltering approach described in Saintonge (2007); the templates
used are Hermite functions. Table 2 lists the infrared properties of
the OHMs. Figure 1 shows the spectra of the six OHMs.

3.2 H I conﬁrmations

We conﬁrmed 129 H i sources with APO observations. For each,
we noted the exact location of the optical counterpart– these occa-
sionally diﬀered slightly from the ALFALFA location due to the
survey’s large beam. We used SDSS DR9 in conjunction with tele-
scope pointing images taken during APO observations to conﬁrm
the J2000 coordinates of the H i optical counterpart, and APO tele-
scope pointing images to conﬁrm the positions of the few objects

all identiﬁed H i sources with their name (6-numeral strings repre-
sent AGC name), optical position, optical velocity, and ALFALFA
velocity.

3.3 Ambiguous Optical Counterparts

Sixty objects remained ambiguous after APO observations: veloc-
ities for these objects matched neither H i nor OH velocities, or no
optical lines were detected. Many of the observed OHM candidates
were not high signal-to-noise ALFALFA detections, and the major-
ity of the ambiguous optical counterparts are likely false positive
ALFALFA detections. When multiple possible optical counterparts

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2015)

appeared within the ALFALFA beam radius, we made observations
of the object brightest in the WISE 22 µm band; some of the am-
biguous optical counterparts likely correspond to observations of
a diﬀerent object than the ALFALFA emitter. Several ambiguous
objects had no observable optical lines. Table 4 lists ambiguous
optical counterparts.

2This spectrum showed both emission and absorption lines. The emission lines were more prevalent, but the oﬀset absorption lines clearly showed in the blue
half of the spectrum. Absorption was especially evident in Hβ and blueward Balmer series lines, where broad emission lines were nearly divided in two by
the oﬀset absorption. The emission velocity occurred at 5035 km s−1, a match for the ALFALFA H i line; the absorption lines were oﬀset to 5770 km s−1. The

absorption and emission lines may be oﬀset because they come from diﬀerent nuclei.

3This object was identiﬁed as a clear H i detection; in SDSS it appears to be a blue compact dwarf galaxy.

4The optical counterpart for this object was conﬁrmed to be the blue extended object to the west of the central ALFALFA coordinates.

5Two objects were observed within the ALFALFA beam radius. One observed galaxy was to the east of the ALFALFA target coordinates, and one to the

south. Both galaxies matched the H i velocity, so the coordinates and measured velocities for both are included in this table.

6Most observed objects have at least ﬁve identifying spectral lines. For this object, only Hα was identiﬁed. Despite the scarcity of observable optical lines in
this spectra, we are conﬁdent of the H i conﬁrmation. The singular line is bright, shows extension along the spatial axis of the spectrum, and it is very close to

the expected H i redshift. In visible light, the object appears to be a low surface brightness galaxy.

vey ﬂux, area, and redshift limits; furthermore, the number of OHM
detections should match predictions from the OH luminosity func-
tion (OHLF, Darling & Giovanelli 2002b). Analysis of ALFALFA
OH completeness provides a test of the OHLF in a blind survey, as-
sesses the sensitivity of a blind H i survey like ALFALFA to OHMs,
and may provide guidance for future H i surveys.

Darling & Giovanelli (2000) lists the majority of the ∼120
OH megamasers known prior to this work; only 8 of these pre-
viously known masers lie within the volume deﬁned by the AL-
FALFA 40% sky coverage (listed in Haynes et al. 2011) and depth
(0.167 ≤ zOH ≤ 0.244). Maser spectra from the Arecibo Mega-
maser Survey show that only one of the eight previously known
masers in the ALFALFA volume is above the survey’s S/N detec-
tion limit of 4.6. This OHM, AGC 181310/IRAS 08201+2801, was
discovered by Darling & Giovanelli (2001) at z = 0.1680; it was
indeed detected by ALFALFA (Table 1). The ﬁve new OHM detec-
tions presented in this work were not found in previous surveys be-
cause the objects did not yet have optical redshifts, which previous
OHM surveys relied on for spectrometer tuning. While ALFALFA
found all previously discovered OHMs within the constraints of
the survey, it found only 12.5% of the known OHMs within its sky
footprint. This indicates that future H i surveys must have lower
detection threshholds than ALFALFA if detecting new OHMs is a
secondary goal.

The OHLF (Darling & Giovanelli 2002b) describes the ex-

pected power-law luminosity density distribution of OHMs:

φ = (9.8+31.9

−7.5 × 10−6)L−0.64±0.21

OH

Mpc−3dex−1.

(2)

We note that the OHLF was developed from the results of a targeted
survey, the Arecibo Megamaser Survey. The ALFALFA results pro-
vide the ﬁrst opportunity to test the OHLF against the results of a
blind survey.

To integrate the OHLF and ﬁnd the number of expected
OHMs, we must compute the volume of the 40% ALFALFA data
release as well as the survey’s luminosity limits. Using the Cosmol-
ogy Calculator (Wright 2006), the comoving volume within AL-
FALFA’s redshift range is 3.17 Gpc3. The survey covers ∼6.8% of
the sky, so we use 0.21 Gpc3 as the total volume of ALFALFA.
The survey does not have a hard upper luminosity cutoﬀ; however,
the OHLF was calculated using data below 103.8L⊙. For this anal-
ysis, we choose an upper luminosity limit of 104L⊙. This is close

enough to the bounds of the Arecibo Megamaser Survey that the
OHLF should still be valid; furthermore, increasing the luminos-
ity limit further will not dramatically change the number of addi-
tional OHMs expected due to the power-law luminosity drop oﬀ.
ALFALFA’s S/N detection limit of 4.6 corresponds to a 7.7 mJy
peak in narrow Gaussian lines like OH; this determines the survey’s
lower luminosity limit. Assuming a Gaussian OH line with a line
width of 150 km s−1 (typical for OHMs) and peak of 7.7 mJy, the in-
tegrated ﬂux of the line is 0.87 Jy km s−1. Assuming a distance cor-
responding to the maximum zOH ≈ 0.25 for ALFALFA, the lower
luminosity bound is 103.2L⊙. However, this is not a hard lower cut-
oﬀ; narrow lines could be detected below our luminosity cutoﬀ and
broad lines could remain undetected above our luminosity cutoﬀ. It
is not surprising, then, that ALFALFA OHM 145537+062437 has
a luminosity of 3.06 dex, below the 3.2 dex cutoﬀ. There are also
reliability limitations at the low-ﬂux limit– despite identifying can-
didate OHMs near 103.2L⊙, we could not measure optical redshifts
for many of the faint optical counterparts and the objects remain in
the ‘ambiguous’ category (Table 4).

Integrating Equation 2 from 103.2L⊙ to 104.0L⊙ over a volume
of 0.21 Gpc3 yields a prediction of 9+73
−8 OHMs in the ALFALFA
α.40 survey. We detected six OHMs in ALFALFA, well within the
large error bars of our expectation. This indicates that OHMs found
in a blind survey are consistent with the OHLF from the Arecibo
Megamaser Survey. A plot of the OHLF and the distribution of
observed OHMs is shown in Figure 2.

ALFALFA found all previously known OHMs within the sur-
vey detection limits and the total number of OHMs in the survey
is consistent with empirical predictions from the OHLF. We can
therefore say that, within error, the ALFALFA survey is complete
with respect to OHMs.

The designation ‘neither’ indicates that the observed velocity matches neither H i nor OH, while ‘no lines’ designates objects for which no optical lines were
observable and no velocity determination could be made. ‘ML’ indicates that the ALFALFA H i detection is a marginal line, likely not a real detections. ‘UL’
indicates that the ALFALFA line is uncertain, and could be H i or another line.

4The velocity determination for this object was measured from only one line, presumed to be Hα.

5Bleed-in from a nearby star obscured optical lines for this object.

6Two objects were observed within beam uncertainty of the ALFALFA detection. The ﬁrst had no visible optical lines, and the second (the velocity listed in

Table 4) showed broad line emission that matched neither the OH nor the H i velocity.

7Due to high redshift, this object is likely an AGN.

8Guiding errors during observing rendered these frames unusable; no further observations were made.

two populations do not show signiﬁcant evidence for being drawn
from diﬀerent distributions. This indicates that the IR selection cri-
teria used in previous targeted OHM surveys did not exclude a sig-
niﬁcant portion of the OHM population found in a blind survey; ad-
ditionally, this work has not discovered a new population of OHMs
missed by targeted surveys.

4.3 Distinguishing OH from H I

It is impossible to distinguish OH lines from H i lines using only H i
survey spectra. OHMs at z∼0.2 have the same observed frequency
as H i at z∼0.05, and the two radio lines are nearly indistinguish-
able. Example OH and H i lines from ALFALFA are shown in Fig-
ure 3.

Given that it is diﬃcult to distinguish between H i and OH,
how important is it for an H i survey to separate the two popula-
tions? Only ∼0.05% of ALFALFA α.40 objects are OHMs. How-
ever, this is mostly due to the survey’s low redshift range: the per-
centage of OH lines detected in an H i survey is expected to increase
with redshift because thermal H i emission is mass-limited while
OH maser ampliﬁcation is not. Half of the detections from an H i
survey at a redshift of z = 1 are expected to be OH lines (Briggs
1998).

thus provides an opportunity to verify the selection criteria used in
previous targeted surveys and to test for a new OHM-producing
environment at z∼0.2.

We use a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistical test
to determine if the two OHM populations come from the same dis-
tribution in IR space. The OHM comparison sample consists of 109
OHM host galaxies identiﬁed in Baan, Salzer & LeWinter (1998)
and the Arecibo Megamaser Survey. We use magnitudes and col-
ors from the WISE All-Sky Source Catalog (Wright et al. 2010) as
well as 60 and 100 µm ﬂux from IRAS (Saunders et al. 2000) and
the FIR luminosity calculated from IRAS according to the prescrip-
tion in Fullmer & Lonsdale (1980). IRAS did not detect ALFALFA
OHMs AGC 219215 and 022657+282457, so they are not included
in the K-S tests for IRAS 60 and 100 µm ﬂux or FIR luminosity; all
previously known OHMs are detected in IRAS. K-S test p-values

arate H i from OH line emitters. Cuts were chosen to include all
OHMs and exclude as many H i sources as possible; typically, the
cut was made 0.1−0.2 dex above or below extremal OHM magni-
tudes or colors. Reducing the sample size was an iterative process:
after making an initial cut and removing objects outside of the cut,
we inspected the remaining sample and made a second cut in a dif-
ferent IR parameter. In total we made four cuts, listed in Table 7.
In addition to the two colors the K-S test indicates are inconsistent,
we also made cuts in [3.4] and [22]. The [3.4] and [22] magnitude
cuts were able to exclude a signiﬁcant number of objects from the
tails of the distributions. These objects did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the p-values of the K-S test.

High values of [3.4] − [4.6] and [4.6] − [12] color select red
objects, such as IR-luminous dusty ULIRGs likely to host OHMs.
The 3.4 µm band corresponds to the stellar bump from old, red
stars, so the [3.4] magnitude cut selects galaxies with large stellar
mass (like ULIRGs) for a ﬁxed redshift. OHMs are luminous at 22
µm, but are distant; local H i sources could be brighter in [22] even
though they are less luminous at 22 µm. So the high [22] cut re-
moves nearby galaxies with low or moderate 22 µm luminosities.
Cutting only bright 22 µm objects also avoids issues with incom-
pleteness as it does not aﬀect objects with low signal-to-noise in
the WISE 22 µm band.

The total sample of ALFALFA H i and OH sources as well as
the infrared cuts from Table 7 are plotted in Figure 4. While the
[22] magnitude cut does not divide the sample to the same degree
the other three cuts do, it removes ∼50 objects that the other cuts
cannot distinguish from OHMs. We also see from Figure 4 that
it is not necessary to modify our simple cuts into more complex
cuts involving functions of more than one IR parameter– slanted
lines on the plots would not exclude a large number of additional
objects. A ﬁnal K-S test (Table 8) on the post-cut samples conﬁrms
that further cuts in WISE space will not signiﬁcantly improve the
separation of OH and H i line emitters.

ALFALFA objects that remain after the four IR cuts are plot-
ted in color-color and color-magnitude space in Figure 5. There
are 83 remaining H i sources, of which 43 are detected in WISE
22 µm. The IR cuts removed 99.3% of all H i sources and 99.3%

larger population of OHMs than ALFALFA. Not only will locating
OH lines in these surveys provide a larger and more robust sample
of OHMs to further science goals such as tracking the galaxy
merger rate as a function of redshift, it will also improve the
ﬁdelity of the survey catalogs. While OH lines in ALFALFA are
not numerous, they are an excellent training set for distinguishing
OH lines from H i lines without the use of optical spectroscopy.

We expect OHMs, almost exclusively found in dusty IR-bright
galaxies, to show diﬀerent IR properties than H i emitters. We used
a K-S test in WISE colors and magnitudes to compare the 6 AL-
FALFA OHMs with ALFALFA H i sources detected by WISE. We
matched ALFALFA sources to the WISE All-Sky Source Catalog
within a 45 arcsecond radius, requiring signal-to-noise > 5 at 3.4,
4.6, and 12 µm (bands W1, W2, and W3, respectively). Whenever
optical counterparts were available, we used the optical coordinates
for the match. WISE sources with the smallest oﬀset from the AL-
FALFA coordinates were selected to be the IR counterpart. In total,
12,416 ALFALFA H i sources were detected by WISE at 3.4, 4.6,
and 12 µm. Only 5,801 of these H i sources were detected by WISE
at 22 µm, so only these objects are used for the [22] and [12] − [22]
K-S tests. The notation [22] refers to the Vega magnitude measured
at 22 µm. Results of the K-S tests are tabulated in Table 6 and indi-
cate that H i and OH lines are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in [4.6] − [12]
and [3.4] − [4.6] colors.

of H i sources detected in WISE 22 µm, increasing the fraction of
OHMs in the post-cut ALFALFA sample two orders of magnitude
from 4.8 × 10−4 to 6.7 × 10−2. Other than a few H i outliers, the OH
and H i detections that remain after the cuts are spread fairly uni-
formly across WISE space; this indicates that further cuts would
not signiﬁcantly improve the separation of the two populations.

4.4 ULIRG Redshift Evolution

It is necessary to introduce a redshift dependence to the magni-
tude and color cuts listed in Table 7 if the cuts are to be used for
higher-redshift H i surveys. We used Arp 220, the closest OHM and
ULIRG, as a template spectral energy distribution (SED). The SED
was created using Spitzer spectra from Armus et al. (2004); the op-
tical and near-IR data were ﬁt using two stellar components (old
and young), and the far-IR SED was ﬁt using dust continuum mod-
els from Chary & Elbaz (2001). In Figure 6, we plot the redshift

evolution of Arp 220 and our infrared cuts in WISE color-color
and color-magnitude space.

The Arp 220 tracks remain within the IR cuts for the AL-
FALFA OHM redshift range, zOH ≤ 0.25. The tracks above this red-
shift indicate how the cuts should evolve for application to planned
future H i surveys. We note that the redshift evolution results in
most OHMs being undetectable in the WISE 22 µm band by a red-
shift of z ∼ 0.4. However, it may be possible to continue to separate
H i and OH lines without use of the WISE 22 µm band or by apply-
ing the techniques used in this work to deeper IR catalogs.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work we identiﬁed OH megamasers in the ALFALFA H i
survey, conﬁrmed their number and IR properties matched empiri-
cal predictions based on previous surveys, and developed a method
to separate OH megamasers from 99% of H i line emitters without

after the IR cuts. The tracks stay within the desired region through the ALFALFA redshift, z=0.1−0.25. Evolution past this point governs how the cuts should

optical spectroscopy. Optical spectroscopy of 194 candidate OHMs
in ALFALFA conﬁrmed 129 uncertain H i optical counterparts and
discovered 5 new OHMs.

Only one previously known OHM lay within the survey’s vol-
ume and detection limits; this OHM was detected, raising the to-
tal number of OHMs in ALFALFA to six. Integrating the OHLF
(Darling & Giovanelli 2002b) over the sky footprint, redshift range,
and luminosity detection limits of ALFALFA predicts 9+73
−8 OHMs
in the survey, consistent with the six detections.

Previous OHM surveys selected candidates based on IR prop-
erties; the ALFALFA OHMs are the ﬁrst found in a blind spectral
line survey. We used K-S tests to show that the two OHM popula-
tions come from the same statistical distribution in WISE color and
magnitude as well as IRAS 60- and 100-µm ﬂux and FIR luminos-
ity. This validates the IR selection criteria used in previous surveys
and suggests there is no previously unknown OHM-producing en-
vironment at z ∼ 0.2.

We used the WISE All-Sky Source Catalog to determine if
OH line emitters can be distinguished from H i line emitters with-
out the use of optical spectroscopy. This is of particular interest for
planned high-redshift H i surveys, as the percentage of OH lines in
an H i survey is expected to increase with redshift and reach ∼50%
by z = 1 (Briggs 1998). K-S tests conﬁrm that the ALFALFA H i
and OH populations can be distinguished in WISE color and mag-
nitude space, and four IR cuts (Table 7) reduce the total number
of H i objects from 12,416 to 83 and the number of H i objects
detected in WISE 22 µm from 5,801 to 43, excluding 99.3% of
the ALFALFA H i sample. After the cuts, K-S tests could not dis-
tinguish the OH and H i populations; this indicates further cuts in
WISE space cannot further separate the two populations. It is possi-
ble that the OHM fraction could be increased using additional data
such as galaxy morphology. The redshift evolution of the closest
OHM, Arp 220, provides guidelines for adjusting the WISE color
and magnitude cuts for higher-redshift H i surveys. However, the
sensitivity of the WISE 22 µm band precludes the use of a [22] µm
cut at z & 0.4. While a separation scheme based only on WISE data
can distinguish OH from H i, future work should investigate a sep-

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2015)

aration scheme using additional data sources before the advent of
high-redshift H i surveys.
