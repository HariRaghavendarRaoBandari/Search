TRAVELING WAVES FOR A LATTICE DYNAMICAL SYSTEM

ARISING IN A DIFFUSIVE ENDEMIC MODEL

YAN-YU CHEN, JONG-SHENQ GUO, AND FRANC¸ OIS HAMEL

Abstract. This paper is concerned with a lattice dynamical system modeling the evolu-
tion of susceptible and infective individuals at discrete niches. We prove the existence of
traveling waves connecting the disease-free state to non-trivial leftover concentrations. We
also characterize the minimal speed of traveling waves and we prove the non-existence of
waves with smaller speeds.

In this article, we consider the following lattice dynamical system (LDS)

where sn = sn(t), in = in(t), t ∈ R, and µ, β, γ are positive constants. Here sn(t) and in(t)
represent the population density of the susceptible individuals and the infective individuals
at niches n at time t, 1 and d are the random migration coeﬃcients for susceptible and
infective population, respectively, and µ is regarded as the rate of the inﬂow of newborns
into the susceptible population by assuming the total population of susceptible, infective and
recovered individuals is normalized to be 1. The death rate of the susceptible population
and the infective population are both assumed to be µ, β is the infective (transmission)
coeﬃcient and γ is the recovered/removed coeﬃcient. Actually, as in [27], the equation for
the recovered individuals rn(t) is given by
drn

= γin − µrn,

if there is no migration of the recovered individuals.

For system (1.1), it easy to see there are two constant states (1, 0) and

(1.2)

(s∗, e∗) :=(cid:16) 1

σ

,

µ
β

(σ − 1)(cid:17),

where σ := β/(µ + γ). In this paper, we always assume that σ > 1, that is,

β > µ + γ.

This means that, when the density of susceptible individuals is close to 1, the infective
individuals have a positive per capita growth rate. Without migration, the steady state
(1, 0) is dynamically unstable with respect to perturbations whose second component are
positive, while the steady state (s∗, e∗) is dynamically stable. System (1.1) is therefore
called monostable.

In this paper, we are interested in the existence of traveling wave solutions of (1.1). Here

a traveling wave solution is a bounded solution which can be expressed by

sn(t) = φ(n + ct) and in(t) = ψ(n + ct)

for n ∈ Z and t ∈ R, for some nonnegative bounded functions φ, ψ on R (the wave proﬁles)
and some constant c (the wave speed). By setting ξ = n + ct and substituting (sn(t), in(t)) =
(φ(ξ), ψ(ξ)) into (1.1), we obtain

(1.3)

( −c φ′(ξ) + D[φ](ξ) + µ (1 − φ(ξ)) − β φ(ξ) ψ(ξ) = 0,

−c ψ′(ξ) + d D[ψ](ξ) − (µ + γ) ψ(ξ) + β φ(ξ) ψ(ξ) = 0

for all ξ ∈ R, where

D[f ](ξ) := f (ξ + 1) + f (ξ − 1) − 2f (ξ).

Furthermore, from the epidemic point of view, we are interested in traveling wave solutions
connecting the trivial disease-free state (1, 0) as ξ → −∞ (ahead of the front) and non-trivial
states as ξ → +∞.

Deﬁne the constant c∗ by

(1.4)

c∗ := inf
λ>0

d (eλ + e−λ − 2) + β − µ − γ

λ

.

By the assumption β > µ + γ (i.e. σ > 1), we know that c∗ = c∗(d, β, µ, γ) is a well-deﬁned
real number (and the inﬁmum in (1.4) is a minimum) and c∗ > 0.

Our main result is the following theorem on the existence of traveling waves for (1.3) and

the characterization of their minimal speed.

Theorem 1.1. For any c ≥ c∗, there exists a bounded classical solution (φ, ψ) of the sys-
tem (1.3) such that

(1.5)

and

(1.6)

0 < φ < 1 in R, ψ > 0 in R

lim
ξ→−∞

(φ(ξ), ψ(ξ)) = (1, 0),

TRAVELING WAVE FOR A LATTICE DYNAMICAL SYSTEM

together with

(1.7) 0 < lim inf
ξ→+∞

φ(ξ) ≤ s∗ ≤ lim sup
ξ→+∞

φ(ξ) < 1 and 0 < lim inf
ξ→+∞

ψ(ξ) ≤ e∗ ≤ lim sup
ξ→+∞

ψ(ξ) < +∞,

where (s∗, e∗) is given in (1.2). Furthermore, for any c < c∗, there is no classical solution
(φ, ψ) of the system (1.3) satisfying (1.5) and (1.6).

Behind the front, as ξ → +∞, the leftover concentrations of susceptible and infective
individuals are non-trivial. It is still an open question to know whether the traveling wave
solutions converge to the endemic state (s∗, e∗) as ξ → +∞, but Theorem 1.1 asserts that
both susceptible and infective individuals coexist behind the front and that the endemic
state (s∗, e∗) is the only possible constant leftover state. To show the convergence to the
endemic state as ξ → +∞, the diﬃculties come from the fact that (1.3) is a system and
is non-local (such issues also arise for equations with non-local nonlinear interaction, see
e.g. [1, 2, 4, 17, 18, 22, 20, 36, 37]). We also point out that the random migration coeﬃcient
d for the infective individuals is any arbitrary positive real number and is therefore in general
diﬀerent from that for the susceptible individuals. Furthermore, we mention that, due to
the transmission term s with opposite signs, the systems (1.1) and (1.3) are not monotone
(ne ither cooperative nor competitive) and therefore do not satisfy the maximum principle.
Let us ﬁnally mention some references on related problems. Actually, there is a vast
literature on the study of traveling wave solutions for lattice dynamical systems or discrete
versions of continuous parabolic partial diﬀerential equations. For monostable equations or
monostable monotone systems, we refer to e.g. [6, 7, 8, 15, 16, 21, 23, 25, 29, 30, 34, 35, 38, 41].
Waves for bistable lattice dynamical systems have been studied in e.g. [5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 24, 26, 28, 31, 32, 33, 39, 40].

Remark 1.2. Notice that the necessity condition c ≥ c∗ holds for any traveling wave (φ, ψ)
satisfying (1.3), (1.5) and (1.6). The limiting conditions (1.7) or the boundedness of ψ are
not used here.

Outline of the paper. Sections 2 and 3 are devoted to the proof of the existence of a
traveling wave in case c > c∗, with some preliminaries on lower and upper solutions in Sec-
tion 2. Approximated solutions in bounded domains are constructed and the traveling wave
solving (1.3) is obtained by passing to the limit in the whole real line. Some intricate issues
are to show that the limiting ψ component is bounded and that the leftover concentrations
are non-trivial. Section 4 is devoted to the proof of the existence of a traveling wave for
the minimal speed c∗, by passing to the limit ck → (c∗)+, after a suitable shift of the origin
and after showing that the solutions with speed ck are uniformly bounded. Lastly, Sec-
tion 5 is concerned with the proof of the necessity condition c ≥ c∗ for any traveling wave
satisfying (1.5) and (1.6).

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we always assume that c > c∗. Then the equation

(2.1)

d (eλ + e−λ − 2) − c λ + β − µ − γ = 0

4

has two positive roots λ1 and λ2 with 0 < λ1 < λ2. Notice that

d (eλ + e−λ − 2) − c λ + β − µ − γ < 0

for all λ ∈ (λ1, λ2).

2.1. Upper and lower solutions. First, we deﬁne the notion of upper solution (φ, ψ) and
lower solution (φ, ψ) of (1.3) as follows.

Deﬁnition 2.1. If φ, ψ, φ, ψ are continuous in R, of class C 1 on R \ F for some ﬁnite set
F and if they satisfy the following inequalities

(2.2)

D[φ](ξ) − c φ
(ξ) + µ (1 − φ(ξ)) − β φ(ξ) ψ(ξ) ≤ 0,
D[φ](ξ) − c φ′(ξ) + µ (1 − φ(ξ)) − β φ(ξ) ψ(ξ) ≥ 0,

′

(ξ) − (µ + γ) ψ(ξ) + β φ(ξ) ψ(ξ) ≤ 0,
d D[ψ](ξ) − c ψ
d D[ψ](ξ) − c ψ′(ξ) − (µ + γ) ψ(ξ) + β φ(ξ) ψ(ξ) ≥ 0

for all ξ ∈ R \ F , then the functions (φ, ψ), (φ, ψ) are called a pair of upper and lower
solutions of (1.3).

Following [3, 19], we introduce

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

where

(2.9)

φ(ξ) = 1, ψ(ξ) = eλ1ξ,

ξ ∈ R,

ξ ≤ ξ1,

Here the constants θ, ρ, η and q are chosen in sequence such that the following assumptions
(A1)-(A4) hold:

(A1) θ > 0 is small enough such that 0 < θ < λ1 and eθ + e−θ − 2 − c θ − µ < 0,

(A2) ρ > max(cid:26)1,

(A3) η ∈ (1, min{1 + θ/λ1, λ2/λ1}) such that

d (eηλ1 + e−ηλ1 − 2) − c η λ1 + β − µ − γ < 0,

(A4) q > max(cid:26)e(1−η)λ1ξ1,

Note that we have

Also, it easy to see that

max{0, 1 − ρ eθξ} ≤ φ(ξ) ≤ φ(ξ) = 1, max{0, eλ1ξ − q eηλ1ξ} ≤ ψ(ξ) ≤ ψ(ξ) = eλ1ξ

for all ξ ∈ R.

The next lemma gives the existence of a pair of upper and lower solutions.

Lemma 2.2. The functions (φ, ψ) and (φ, ψ) deﬁned by (2.6)-(2.8) are a pair of upper and
lower solutions of (1.3).

Proof. First, the functions φ and ψ are of class C 1(R) and the inequalities (2.2) and (2.4)
hold on R, since

′
D[φ](ξ) − c φ

(ξ) + µ (1 − φ(ξ)) − β φ(ξ) ψ(ξ) = −β ψ(ξ) ≤ 0,

′

for all ξ ∈ R.

= eλ1ξ(cid:2)d (eλ1 + e−λ1 − 2) − c λ1 + β − µ − γ(cid:3) = 0

Next, the function φ is continuous in R and of class C 1(R\{ξ1}) and we would like to show
that (2.3) holds for ξ 6= ξ1. For ξ > ξ1, this is trivial since φ(ξ) = 0. When ξ < ξ1 (< 0), we
have φ(ξ) = 1 − ρeθξ and so

D[φ](ξ) − c φ′(ξ) + µ (1 − φ(ξ)) − β φ(ξ) ψ(ξ)

= 1 − ρ eθ(ξ+1) + 1 − ρ eθ(ξ−1) − 2 + 2 ρ eθξ + c θ ρ eθξ + µ ρ eθξ − β eλ1ξ + β ρ e(θ+λ1)ξ

≥ eθξ(cid:2) − ρ (eθ + eθ − 2 c θ − µ) − β e(λ1−θ)ξ(cid:3)
≥ β eθξ(cid:2)1 − e(λ1−θ)ξ(cid:3) ≥ 0

by θ < λ1 and the choice of ρ.

Finally, the function ψ is continuous in R and of class C 1(R\{ξ2}) and we claim that (2.5)
holds for ξ 6= ξ2. Clearly, (2.5) holds for ξ > ξ2. For the case ξ < ξ2, due to ξ2 < ξ1 < 0, we
know that φ(ξ) = 1 − ρeθξ and ψ(ξ) = eλ1ξ − qeηλ1ξ. Then we obtain

d D[ψ](ξ) − c ψ′(ξ) − (µ + γ) ψ(ξ) + β φ(ξ) ψ(ξ)

≥ d(cid:2)− q eηλ1(ξ+1)− q eηλ1(ξ−1)+ 2 q eηλ1ξ(cid:3)+ c η λ1 q eηλ1ξ − (β − µ − γ) q eηλ1ξ − β ρ e(θ+λ1)ξ
= eηλ1ξn− q(cid:2)d (eηλ1 + e−ηλ1 − 2) − c η λ1 + β − µ − γ(cid:3) − β ρ e[θ+(1−η)λ1]ξo
≥ β ρ eηλ1ξ(cid:0)1 − e(θ+(1−η)λ1)ξ(cid:1) ≥ 0

by the choices of η and q. Therefore, the proof of this lemma has been completed.

Next, we give some notations. Set Cl := C([−l, l]) × C([−l, l]) and

From the deﬁnition of φ, φ, ψ, ψ, we know that 0 ≤ φ ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ ψ ≤ eλ1l in [−l, l] for any
(φ, ψ) ∈ S l. Hence S l is a nonempty bounded closed convex set in (Cl, k · k), where k · k is
the usual sup norm. For any (φ, ψ) ∈ S l, we extend (φ, ψ) be continuity outside the interval
[−l, l] as in (2.10) and we introduce the continuous functions H l
2(φ, ψ) deﬁned
in R by

1(φ, ψ) and H l

.

( H l

H l

1(φ, ψ)(ξ) = α φ(ξ) + D[φ](ξ) + µ (1 − φ(ξ)) − β φ(ξ) ψ(ξ),

where α = αl is a positive constant such that

α > max(cid:8)2 + µ + β eλ1l, 2 d + µ + γ(cid:9).

For (φi, ψi) ∈ S l, i = 1, 2, with φ1 ≤ φ2 and ψ1 ≤ ψ2 in [−l, l], we have
(2.11) H l

1(φ1, ψ2)(ξ) ≤ H l

1(φ1, ψ1)(ξ) ≤ H l

for all ξ ∈ [−l, l]. Finally, we deﬁne the operator F l = (F l

Note that a ﬁxed point (φ, ψ) of the operator F l, extended outside the interval [−l, l] as
in (2.10), gives a solution of (2.10) which is continuous in R and of class C 1(R\{−l, l}).

To show the existence of such a ﬁxed point, we apply Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem in

the next lemma.

Lemma 2.3. Given l > −ξ2, there exists a C(R) × C(R) and C 1(R\{−l, l}) × C 1(R\{−l, l})
solution (φ, ψ) of (2.10) such that

(2.12)

0 ≤ φ ≤ φ ≤ 1

and 0 ≤ ψ ≤ ψ ≤ ψ in (−∞, l].

Proof. First, we claim that F l(S l) ⊂ S l. By (2.11), for any (φ, ψ) ∈ S l, we have

F l
1(φ, ψ) ≤ F l

1(φ, ψ) ≤ F l

1(φ, ψ) and F l

2(φ, ψ) ≤ F l

2(φ, ψ) ≤ F l

1(φ, ψ) in [−l, l].

By Lemma 2.2 and the deﬁnition of the upper and lower solutions, we also derive that

φ ≤ F l

1(φ, ψ), F l

1(φ, ψ) ≤ φ, ψ ≤ F l

2(φ, ψ) and F l

2(φ, ψ) ≤ ψ in [−l, l].

Hence F l(S l) ⊂ S l.

By using Arzela-Ascoli Theorem, the operator F l : S l → S l is completely continuous with
respect to the sup norm. With the help of Schauder’s ﬁxed point theorem, we conclude
that there exists a pair (φ, ψ) ∈ S l such that (φ, ψ) = F l(φ, ψ). Therefore, (φ, ψ), extended
outside the interval [−l, l] as in (2.10), solves (2.10) and satisﬁes the properties stated in
Lemma 2.3.
(cid:3)

3. Existence of a traveling wave for c > c∗

3.1. Proof of Theorem 1.1 for c > c∗. In this section, we show Theorem 1.1 for any
ﬁxed real number c ∈ (c∗, +∞). Namely, we show the existence of a bounded solution (φ, ψ)
of (1.3) satisfying 0 < φ < 1 in R, ψ > 0 in R, and such that (1.6) and (1.7) hold.

First, we consider a positive increasing sequence {lk}k∈N such that lk → ∞ as k → ∞,
and lk > −ξ2 for all k ∈ N, where ξ2 < 0 is as in (2.9). By Lemma 2.3, for each k ∈ N, there
exists a C(R) ∩ C 1(R\{−lk, lk}) solution (φk, ψk) of (2.10) and (2.12) for l = lk. For each
K ∈ N such that lK ≥ 2, since ψ is bounded above in [−lK, lK], it follows from (2.12) that
the sequences

{φk}k≥K,

{ψk}k≥K,

{φkψk}k≥K

are uniformly bounded on [−lK, lK]. Also, the sequences {φ′
k}k≥K are uniformly
bounded in [−lK +1, lK −1], due to (2.10) and (2.12). Since φ′′
k(ξ) can be expressed
in terms of φk(ξ), ψk(ξ), φk(ξ ± 1), ψk(ξ ± 1), φk(ξ ± 2), ψk(ξ ± 2), φ′
k(ξ) in
[−lK + 2, lK − 2], one infers that the sequences {φ′′
k}k≥K are uniformly bounded
in [−lK +2, lK −2]. By using Arzela-Ascoli theorem on [−lK +2, lK −2] for every K ∈ N large
enough, we obtain a subsequence {(φkj , ψkj )} of {(φk, ψk)} through the diagonal process such
that

k}k≥K and {ψ′
k(ξ) and ψ′′

k}k≥K and {ψ′′

k(ξ) and ψ′

φkj → φ, ψkj → ψ, φ′

kj → φ′, ψ′

kj → ψ′ as j → +∞

uniformly in any compact subinterval of R, for some functions φ ∈ C 1(R) and ψ ∈ C 1(R).
Then (φ, ψ) is a solution of the system (1.3) with

(3.1)

0 ≤ φ ≤ φ ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ ψ ≤ ψ ≤ ψ in R.

By the deﬁnitions of φ, ψ and ψ, it easy to check that

(φ, ψ)(−∞) = (1, 0).

Notice also that, by diﬀerentiating the equations (1.3), one infers by induction that the
functions φ and ψ are of class C ∞ in R.

Lemma 3.1. The functions φ and ψ are non-trivial, in the sense that

0 < φ < 1 and ψ > 0 in R.

Proof. Firstly, owing to the deﬁnition of ψ, we have ψ > 0 in (−∞, ξ2). For contradiction,
we assume that there exists a real number ξ0 ∈ [ξ2, +∞) such that ψ(ξ0) = 0 and ψ(ξ) > 0
for all ξ < ξ0. Since ψ ≥ 0 in R, we also have ψ′(ξ0) = 0. From the second equation of (1.3),
we get that ψ(ξ0 − 1) = ψ(ξ0 + 1) = 0, a contradiction to the deﬁnition of ξ0.

Let us now show that φ > 0 over R. Indeed, if φ(ξ∗) = 0 for some real number ξ∗, then

0 = −c φ′(ξ∗) + D[φ](ξ∗) + µ(cid:0)1 − φ(ξ∗)(cid:1) − β φ(ξ∗) ψ(ξ∗) = −c φ′(ξ∗) + D[φ](ξ∗) + µ > 0,

8

Y.-Y. CHEN, J.-S. GUO, AND F. HAMEL

since φ′(ξ∗) = 0, D[φ](ξ∗) ≥ 0 and µ > 0. This contradiction leads to the inequality φ > 0
in R.

Similarly, we claim that φ < 1 in R by a contradiction argument. If there exists a real

number ˜ξ such that φ( ˜ξ) = 1, then

0 = −c φ′( ˜ξ) + D[φ]( ˜ξ) + µ(cid:0)1 − φ( ˜ξ)(cid:1) − β φ( ˜ξ) ψ( ˜ξ) = −c φ′( ˜ξ) + D[φ]( ˜ξ) − β ψ( ˜ξ) < 0,

since φ′( ˜ξ) = 0, D[φ]( ˜ξ) ≤ 0 and ψ( ˜ξ) > 0. This contradiction leads to the inequality φ < 1
in R.
(cid:3)

The next main step consists in showing that the function ψ is actually bounded. A ﬁrst
key-point is the following Harnack type property for equations of the type (1.3) satisﬁed by
the second component ψ. We state this property in a more general framework.

Lemma 3.2. Let M be a positive real number. Then there exists a constant C = C(M) > 0
such that, for any continuous functions a and b with M −1 ≤ a(ξ) ≤ M and b(ξ) ≥ −M for
all ξ ∈ R and for any positive C 1(R) function u satisfying

there holds

u′(ξ) ≥ a(ξ) u(ξ + 1) + b(ξ) u(ξ) for all ξ ∈ R,

C −1 ≤

u(ξ + 1)

u(ξ)

≤ C for all ξ ∈ R.

In order not to lengthen too much the main line of the proof of Theorem 1.1 with c > c∗,

the proof of Lemma 3.2 is postponed in Section 3.2.

Coming back to our solutions (φ, ψ) of (1.3), since c > 0 and φ is nonnegative, it follows
from Lemma 3.2 applied to the positive function u = ψ solving ψ′(ξ) ≥ (d/c)ψ(ξ + 1) −
(2d/c + µ/c + γ/c) ψ(ξ) that the functions ξ 7→ ψ(ξ ± 1)/ψ(ξ) are bounded in R. Hence,
from the equation (1.3) itself and since φ is bounded, the function

ξ 7→

ψ′(ξ)
ψ(ξ)

is therefore bounded too.

The following two lemmas deal with the behavior of φ and ψ at +∞ if lim supξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) =
+∞. The ﬁrst one says that φ is small when ψ is large. This property actually holds locally
uniformly with respect to the speed c. It is stated in this more general framework since it
will be used again in Section 4 to get the existence of a bounded solution (φ, ψ) of (1.3) with
speed c∗.

Lemma 3.3. Let 0 < c ≤ c be two given positive real numbers. Let {ck} be a sequence of
real numbers in [c, c] and let {(φk, ψk)} be a sequence of solutions of (1.3) with speed ck and
satisfying (1.5). If {ξk} is a sequence of real numbers such that ψk(ξk) → +∞ as k → +∞,
then φk(ξk) → 0 as k → +∞.

Since this lemma is concerned with general sequences of solutions with diﬀerent speeds,
and in order not to lengthen too much the main line of the proof of Theorem 1.1 with given
speed c > c∗, the proof of Lemma 3.3 is postponed in Section 3.2.

Coming back to our solution (φ, ψ) of (1.3) satisfying (1.5) and (1.6), the following result

shows the convergence of ψ to +∞ at +∞ if it were not bounded.

Lemma 3.4. If lim supξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) = +∞, then limξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) = +∞.

Proof. Assume by way of contradiction that lim supξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) = +∞ and lim inf ξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) <
+∞. Since ψ′/ψ is globally bounded, there are then M ∈ R and two sequences {θk} and
{ξk} converging to +∞ and such that

ψ (cid:16) = max

[ξk−1,ξk+1]

ψ(cid:17)

ψ(θk) ≤ M, θk < ξk − 1 < ξk < ξk + 1 < θk+1, ψ(ξk) = max
[θk,θk+1]

for all k ∈ N and limk→+∞ ψ(ξk) = +∞. Therefore, ψ′(ξk) = 0 and d D[ψ](ξk) ≤ 0. Hence,

by (1.3), one infers that(cid:0)µ + γ − β φ(ξk)(cid:1) ψ(ξk) ≤ 0 for all k ∈ N. This is clearly impossible

for large k since ψ(ξk) > 0, and φ(ξk) → 0 as k → +∞ by Lemma 3.3. The proof is thereby
complete.
(cid:3)

To proceed further, we recall the following useful fundamental theory from [8] (or [6]) in

dealing with the asymptotic tail behavior of wave proﬁles for a lattice dynamical system.

Proposition 3.5. [8] Let ς > 0 be a positive constant, let B : R → R be a continuous
function having ﬁnite B(±∞) := limx→±∞ B(x) and let z be a continuous function such that

(3.2)

ς z(x) = eR x+1

x

z(s)ds + eR x−1

x

z(s)ds + B(x), ∀x ∈ R.

Then z is uniformly continuous and bounded in R. In addition, the limits ω± = limx→±∞ z(x)
exist and are real roots of the characteristic equations

ς ω = eω + e−ω + B(±∞).

With this result and the previous lemmas in hand, we can show that ψ is bounded in R.

Lemma 3.6. The function ψ is bounded.

Proof. Assume not. Then lim supξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) = +∞, since ψ is continuous, positive, and
ψ(−∞) = 0. Therefore, Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 imply that ψ(ξ) → +∞ and φ(ξ) → 0 as
ξ → +∞. From (1.3), the continuous function z := ψ′/ψ satisﬁes

z(x) = eR x+1

x

for all x ∈ R. Since φ has ﬁnite limits at ±∞ and φ(+∞) = 0, it then follows from
Proposition 3.5 that, in particular, z has a ﬁnite limit ω at +∞, with

(3.3)

d(cid:0)eω + e−ω − 2(cid:1) = c ω + µ + γ.

Since µ and γ are positive, this equation has a negative and a positive root. The function
z = ψ′/ψ cannot converge to the negative root at +∞, since ψ(+∞) = +∞. Therefore,
ψ′/ψ converges at +∞ to the positive root ω of (3.3). Remember now that λ1 < λ2 are the
two positive roots of equation (2.1). Since β > 0, one infers immediately that λ1 < λ2 < ω.
But limξ→+∞ ψ′(ξ)/ψ(ξ) = ω > 0 yields ln ψ(ξ) ∼ ω ξ as ξ → +∞, while (3.1) implies that
ψ(ξ) ≤ ψ(ξ) = eλ1ξ for all ξ ∈ R. One gets a contradiction, since λ1 < ω. As a conclusion,
the function ψ is bounded and the proof of Lemma 3.6 is complete.

To complete the proof of Theorem 1.1 in case c > c∗, we show in the following lemmas

that none of the components φ and ψ can be trivial at +∞.

Lemma 3.7. There holds inf R φ > 0.

Proof. Remember that the C ∞ function φ satisﬁes 0 < φ < 1 in R and φ(−∞) = 1. Assume
by contradiction that inf R φ = 0. Then there exists a sequence {ξk} converging to +∞ such
that φ(ξk) → 0 as k → +∞. On the other hand, since both functions φ and ψ are bounded,
the equations (1.3) guarantee that the functions φ and ψ have bounded derivatives at any
order. Therefore, by Arzela-Ascoli theorem, the functions ξ 7→ φ(ξ + ξk) and ξ 7→ ψ(ξ + ξk)
converge in C ∞
loc(R) as k → +∞, up to extraction of a subsequence, to some nonnegative
C ∞ functions φ∞ and ψ∞. Furthermore,

(3.4)

− c φ′

∞ + D[φ∞] + µ (1 − φ∞) − β φ∞ ψ∞ = 0
in R and φ∞(0) = 0. Since 0 is a global minimum of φ∞, one has φ′
equality at 0 leads to a contradiction, since φ∞ ≥ 0 and µ > 0. Therefore, inf R φ > 0.

∞(0) = 0 and the above
(cid:3)

To show that ψ cannot approach 0 at +∞, even for a sequence, the key-step is the
following lemma saying that ψ is increasing when it is small. The property actually holds
locally uniformly with respect to the speed c and we state the lemma in this slightly more
general framework, since it will be used as such in Section 4.

Lemma 3.8. Let 0 < c ≤ c be two given positive real numbers. There is ε > 0 such that, for
any Γ ∈ [c, c] and for any solution (Φ, Ψ) of (1.3) (with speed Γ in place of c) satisfying (1.5),
there holds

∀ ξ ∈ R,

(cid:0)Ψ(ξ) ≤ ε(cid:1) =⇒(cid:0)Ψ′(ξ) > 0).

In order to conclude now the proof of Theorem 1.1 with c > c∗, the proof of Lemma 3.8
is postponed in Section 3.2. Coming back to our solution (φ, ψ), we immediately get from
Lemma 3.8 and the positivity of ψ in R that

(3.5)

We also claim that

(3.6)

lim inf
ξ→+∞

ψ(ξ) > 0.

lim sup
ξ→+∞

φ(ξ) < 1.

Indeed, otherwise, there exists a sequence of real numbers {ξk} converging to +∞ such that
φ(ξk) → 1 as k → +∞. As in the proof of Lemma 3.7, up to extraction of a subsequence,
the functions ξ 7→ φ(ξ + ξk) and ξ 7→ ψ(ξ + ξk) converge as k → +∞ in C ∞
loc(R) to some
nonnegative C ∞ functions φ∞ and ψ∞ solving (1.3). Furthermore, 0 < φ∞ ≤ 1 and ψ∞ > 0
in R from Lemma 3.7 and (3.5). Since φ∞(0) = 1, one has φ′
∞(0) = 0. The equation (3.4)
satisﬁed by φ∞ at 0 leads to a contradiction, since D[φ∞](0) ≤ 0 and −β φ∞(0) ψ∞(0) =
−β ψ∞(0) < 0. Therefore, the claim (3.6) holds.

In order to complete the proof of (1.7), let us ﬁnally show that

(3.7)

lim inf
ξ→+∞

φ(ξ) ≤ s∗ ≤ lim sup
ξ→+∞

φ(ξ) and lim inf
ξ→+∞

ψ(ξ) ≤ e∗ ≤ lim sup

TRAVELING WAVE FOR A LATTICE DYNAMICAL SYSTEM

11

Call φ− = lim inf ξ→+∞ φ(ξ), φ+ = lim supξ→+∞ φ(ξ), ψ− = lim inf ξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) and ψ+ =
lim supξ→+∞ ψ(ξ). One already knows from (3.5), (3.6) and Lemmas 3.6 and 3.7 that

0 < φ− ≤ φ+ < 1 and 0 < ψ− ≤ ψ+ < +∞.

Consider now a sequence {ξk} converging to +∞ such that ψ(ξk) → ψ− as k → +∞. Up
to extraction of a subsequence (as for instance in the proof of Lemma 3.7), the functions
ξ 7→ φ(ξ + ξk) and ξ 7→ ψ(ξ + ξk) converge in C ∞
loc(R) to some bounded functions 0 < φ∞ < 1
and ψ∞ > 0 satisfying (1.3). Furthermore, 0 < ψ− = ψ∞(0) = minR ψ∞. Therefore,
ψ′

∞(0) = 0 and D[ψ∞](0) ≥ 0. Hence

−(µ + γ) ψ− + β φ∞(0) ψ− ≤ 0,

that is, β φ∞(0) ≤ µ + γ. This yields φ− = lim inf ξ→+∞ φ(ξ) ≤ (µ + γ)/β = 1/σ =
s∗. Similarly, it follows that φ+ = lim supξ→+∞ φ(ξ) ≥ s∗. Consider also a sequence {ζk}
converging to +∞ such that φ(ξk) → φ− as k → +∞. As above, up to extraction of a
subsequence, the functions ξ 7→ φ(ξ + ζk) and ξ 7→ ψ(ξ + ζk) converge in C ∞
loc(R) to some
bounded functions 0 < Φ∞ < 1 and Ψ∞ > 0 satisfying (1.3). Furthermore, 0 < φ− =
Φ∞(0) = minR Φ∞. Therefore, Φ′

∞(0) = 0 and D[Φ∞](0) ≥ 0. Hence

µ (1 − φ−) − β φ− Ψ∞(0) ≤ 0.

Since 0 < φ− ≤ s∗ = 1/σ, one gets immediately that Ψ∞(0) ≥ (µ/β)(σ − 1) = e∗, whence
ψ+ = lim supξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) ≥ e∗. Similarly, it follows that ψ− = lim inf ξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) ≤ e∗.

As a conclusion, (1.7) is proved and the proof of Theorem 1.1 in case c > c∗ is thereby

complete.

As explained after the statement of Theorem 1.1 in Section 1, the question of the existence
of a limit of (φ, ψ) at +∞ is unclear. However, we can say that the a priori existence of a
limit of one of these two functions guarantees the convergence of both, and that the endemic
state (s∗, e∗) deﬁned in (1.2) is the only possible limit.

Lemma 3.9. Let (φ, ψ) be a bounded classical solution of (1.3) satisfying (1.5), (1.6)
and (1.7), with speed c ≥ c∗. If φ(+∞) or ψ(+∞) exists, then they both exist and

(φ(+∞), ψ(+∞)) = (s∗, e∗).

Proof. Assume ﬁrst that l = limξ→+∞ φ(ξ) exists. Property (1.7) yields 0 < l = s∗ < 1.
Consider now any sequence {ξk} converging to +∞. Up to extraction of a subsequence, the
loc(R) to some functions φ∞ = l = s∗
functions ξ 7→ φ(ξ + ξk) and ξ 7→ ψ(ξ + ξk) converge in C ∞
and ψ∞ such that

µ (1 − s∗) − β s∗ ψ∞(ξ) = 0 for all ξ ∈ R.

Therefore, the function ψ∞ is identically equal to the constant µ(1 − s∗)/(βs∗) = e∗. Since
the limit does not depend on the sequence {ξk}, one infers that limξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) = e∗.

Conversely, if L = limξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) exists, property (1.7) yields 0 < L = e∗. For any sequence
loc(R),

{ξk} converging to +∞, the functions ξ 7→ φ(ξ + ξk) and ξ 7→ ψ(ξ + ξk) converge in C ∞

12

Y.-Y. CHEN, J.-S. GUO, AND F. HAMEL

up to a subsequence, to some functions φ∞ and ψ∞ = L = e∗ such that

−(µ + γ) e∗ + β e∗ φ∞(ξ) = 0 for all ξ ∈ R.

Therefore, the function φ∞ is identically equal to the constant (µ + γ)/β = s∗. Since the
limit does not depend on the sequence {ξk}, one infers that limξ→+∞ φ(ξ) = s∗.

Therefore, if the limit l = φ(+∞) or the limit L = ψ(+∞) exists, then they both exist
(cid:3)

such that (φ(+∞), ψ(+∞)) = (s∗, e∗).

Remark 3.10. The condition c ≥ c∗ in Lemma 3.9 is not a restriction, since we shall prove
in Section 5 that, for any solution (φ, ψ) of (1.3) satisfying (1.5) and (1.6) with speed c,
there holds c ≥ c∗.

3.2. Proof of Lemmas 3.2, 3.3 and 3.8. In this section, we prove some technical lemmas
stated in Section 3.1.

Proof of Lemma 3.2. Although the idea of the proof is similar to the one given in [8], we
provide the details here for completeness. Up to multiplication of u by a positive constant
and up to a shift in space, one can assume without loss of generality that u(0) = 1 and it is
suﬃcient to show that u(±1) ≤ C = C(M). Firstly, since u′(ξ) ≥ −M u(ξ) for all ξ ∈ R,
the function ξ 7→ v(ξ) := u(ξ) eM ξ is nondecreasing, hence

u(−1) ≤ eM u(0) = eM .

Secondly, for all ξ ∈ [0, 1], one has

v′(ξ) = (u′(ξ) + Mu(ξ)) eM ξ ≥ a(ξ) u(ξ + 1) eM ξ ≥

v(ξ + 1) e−M

Hence, v(ξ) ≥ v(0) + u(1) ξ/M = 1 + u(1) ξ/M for all ξ ∈ [0, 1]. In other words,

Finally, for all ξ ∈ [−1/2, 0],

v′(ξ) ≥ a(ξ)u(ξ + 1) eM ξ ≥

Therefore,

1 = v(0) ≥ v(−1/2)

and the proof of Lemma 3.2 is thereby complete with C(M) = max{eM , 2M(2MeM − 1)}.✷

Proof of Lemma 3.3. Let 0 < c ≤ c, {ck}, {(φk, ψk)} and {ξk} be as in the statement and
assume by way of contradiction that there are ε > 0 and a subsequence, still denoted with
the same index k, such that ψk(ξk) → +∞ as k → +∞ and φk(ξk) ≥ ε for all k ∈ N.

Since 0 < φk < 1 and ψk > 0 in R, the equation (1.3) for φk (with ck ∈ [c, c]) implies that

k/ψk are globally
bounded in R independently of k ∈ N. Therefore, the limit limk→+∞ ψk(ξk) = +∞ implies
that 0 < Mk := min[ξk−δ,ξk] ψk → +∞ as k → +∞. Now, equation (1.3) and the inequalities

This contradicts the global boundedness of the functions φk. The proof of Lemma 3.3 is

✷

Proof of Lemma 3.8. Assume by way of contradiction that there is no such ε. Then there
exist a sequence of real numbers {ck} in [c, c], a sequence of solutions {(φk, ψk)} of (1.3) with
speed c = ck and 0 < φk < 1, ψk > 0 in R, and a sequence of real numbers {ξk} such that

(3.9)

ψk(ξk) → 0 as k → +∞ and ψ′

k(ξk) ≤ 0 for all k ∈ N.

Up to a shift of the origin, one can assume without loss of generality that

(3.10)

ξk = 0

for all k ∈ N. Up to extraction of a subsequence, one can also assume that ck → c∞ ∈ [c, c]
as k → +∞.

Notice ﬁrst that Lemma 3.2 and the equations (1.3) satisﬁed by (φk, ψk) with ck ∈ [c, c] ⊂
k/ψk} is bounded in L∞(R), that is, there is C > 0 such
k(ξ)| ≤ C ψk(ξ) for all k ∈ N and ξ ∈ R. Since ψk(0) → 0+ as k → +∞, it follows

Furthermore, by diﬀerentiating the equation (1.3) satisﬁed by φk, one gets that the func-

α ≤ Φ∞ ≤ 1 in R and Φ∞(0) = α. Consequently, Φ′
∞(0) = 0 and D[Φ∞](0) ≥ 0, whence
µ (1 − α) = µ (1 − Φ∞(0)) ≤ 0. Thus, α ≥ 1. Since α = inf R φ∞ and φ∞ ≤ 1 in R, one
concludes that

φ∞ = 1 in R.

Now set

ψk(ξ)
ψk(0)
for k ∈ N and ξ ∈ R. Since the sequence {ψ′
k/ψk} is bounded in L∞(R), the positive
functions Ψk are locally bounded, in the sense that supk∈N, |ξ|≤R Ψk(ξ) < +∞ for all R > 0.
Therefore, the functions

we claim that Ψ∞ > 0 in R. Otherwise, there is ξ0 ∈ R such that Ψ∞(ξ0) = 0, and
Ψ′
∞(ξ0) = 0. It follows from (3.12) applied at ξ0 that Ψ∞(ξ0 + 1) = Ψ∞(ξ0 − 1) = 0, and then
Ψ∞(ξ0 + m) = 0 for all m ∈ Z by immediate induction. Since c∞Ψ′
∞ ≥ (β − µ − γ − 2) Ψ∞ in
R, the nonnegative function ξ 7→ Ψ∞(ξ) e−(β−µ−γ−2)ξ/c∞ is nondecreasing. Since it vanishes
at ξ0 + m for all m ∈ Z, one concludes that it is identically equal to 0, whence Ψ∞ = 0 in
R. This contradicts the fact that Ψ∞(0) = 1. Therefore,

for all ξ ∈ R.

Since c∞ ≥ c > 0 and β > µ + γ, the roots of the previous equation are necessarily positive.
In particular, Ψ′

✷

4. The case c = c∗

This section is devoted to the proof of the existence of a traveling wave (φ, ψ) of (1.3)
satisfying (1.5), (1.6) and (1.7) with speed c = c∗. To do so, we consider a sequence {ck} of
real numbers such that ck ∈ (c∗, c∗ + 1] for each k ∈ N, and

ck → c∗ as k → +∞.

For each k ∈ N, Section 3 provides the existence of a traveling wave (φk, ψk) of (1.3) (with
speed ck) satisfying (1.5), (1.6) and (1.7). The natural strategy is to pass to the limit as
k → +∞, in order to get the existence of a traveling wave with the limiting speed c∗. To
achieve this goal, we need some a priori bounds for the functions ψk in order to get a non-
trivial solution at the limit. We also point out that the inequalities (3.1) satisﬁed by the
approximated waves (φk, ψk) do not carry over at the limit ck → c∗ (since the coeﬃcients
in the deﬁnitions of the lower solutions depend on ck and degenerate at the limit ck → c∗).
Therefore, we will have to suitably shift and renormalize the approximated waves (φk, ψk)
before passing to the limit as k → +∞.

The ﬁrst a priori bound asserts that the functions ψk do not converge to 0 uniformly as

k → +∞.

Lemma 4.1. There holds lim inf k→+∞ kψkkL∞(R) > 0.

Proof. Assume that the conclusion does not hold. Then, up to extraction of a subsequence,
one can assume without loss of generality that kψkkL∞(R) → 0 as k → +∞. Since ck ∈
[c∗, c∗ + 1] ⊂ (0, +∞) for each k ∈ N, Lemma 3.8 implies that ψ′
k > 0 in R for all k large
enough. Since each ψk is bounded, it follows that the limit ψk(+∞) exists in R, for all k
large enough. Since each (φk, ψk) satisﬁes the assumptions of Lemma 3.9, one then infers in
particular that, for all k large enough,

ψk(+∞) = e∗ =

µ
β

(σ − 1) > 0.

This contradicts the fact that limk→+∞ kψkkL∞(R) = 0. Thus, the conclusion of Lemma 4.1
holds.
(cid:3)

The second key-point is the boundedness of the sequence {ψk} in L∞(R).

Lemma 4.2. There holds lim supk→+∞ kψkkL∞(R) < +∞.

Proof. Assume that the conclusion does not hold. Then, up to extraction of a subsequence,
one has kψkkL∞(R) → +∞ as k → +∞. For each k ∈ N, since the function ψk is bounded
and positive in R, there is then ξk ∈ R such that

functions ξ 7→ ψ′
k(ξ)/ψk(ξ), from the equation (1.3) satisﬁed with speed ck ∈ (c∗, c∗ + 1]
(remember also that 0 < φk < 1 in R). As a consequence,

ψk(ξ + ξk) −→
k→+∞

+∞ locally uniformly in ξ ∈ R.

Lemma 3.3 then implies that

Φk(ξ) := φk(ξ + ξk) → 0

as k → +∞ locally uniformly in ξ ∈ R.

From the boundedness of the sequence {ψ′

k/ψk} in L∞(R), one also infers that the functions

ξ 7→ Ψk(ξ) =

ψk(ξ + ξk)

ψk(ξk)

are locally bounded independently of k (in the sense that supk∈N kΨkkL∞(K) < +∞ for any
compact set K ⊂ R). Each function Ψk obeys

ck Ψ′

k = d D[Ψk] − (µ + γ) Ψk + β Φk Ψk in R,

whence the functions Ψ′
k are locally bounded too. From Arzela-Ascoli theorem, the positive
functions Ψk converge locally uniformly in R, up to extraction of a subsequence, to a con-
tinuous nonnegative function Ψ∞. Furthermore, from the above equation and the fact that
Φk → 0 as k → +∞ locally uniformly in R (together with ck → c∗ > 0), the functions Ψ′
k
converge locally uniformly in R too. Therefore, the functions Ψk converge in C 1
loc(R) to Ψ∞
and the function Ψ∞ satisﬁes

(4.2)

c∗ Ψ′

∞ = d D[Ψ∞] − (µ + γ) Ψ∞ in R.

Notice that this function Ψ∞ is thus automatically of class C ∞(R). Furthermore, Ψ∞ is
nonnegative and Ψ∞(0) = limk→+∞ Ψk(0) = 1. As in the proof of Lemma 3.8 for the
solution of (3.12), one then infers that Ψ∞ is positive in R.

Finally, for every ξ ∈ R, there holds ψk(ξ + ξk) ≤ kψkkL∞(R) ≤ (1 + 1/k) ψk(ξk) from (4.1).
In other words, Ψk(ξ) ≤ 1 + 1/k for every ξ ∈ R and k ∈ N with k ≥ 1, whence Ψ∞(ξ) ≤ 1
for every ξ ∈ R. Therefore, since Ψ∞(0) = 1, 0 is a global maximum of the function Ψ∞,
and Ψ′
∞(0) = 0, D[Ψ∞](0) ≤ 0. The equation (4.2) evaluated at 0 leads to a contradiction,
since µ and γ are positive. The proof of Lemma 4.2 is thereby complete.

End of the proof of Theorem 1.1 in case c = c∗. First of all, Lemma 3.8 applied with
c = c∗ > 0 and c = c∗ + 1 yields the existence of ε > 0 such that Ψ′(ξ) > 0 for every ξ ∈ R
with Ψ(ξ) ≤ ε, and for every solution (Φ, Ψ) of (1.3) and (1.5) with speed c ∈ [c∗, c∗ + 1].
Without loss of generality, one can assume that

(4.3)

0 < ε ≤ e∗ =

µ
β

(σ − 1).

Coming back to our solutions (φk, ψk) of (1.3) (with speed ck) satisfying (1.5), (1.6) and (1.7),
it follows from Lemma 4.1 and the positivity of each ψk that one can also assume without
loss of generality that

Therefore, for each k ∈ N, since ψk(−∞) = 0 and ψk > 0, there is ξk ∈ R such that

0 < ε < inf
k∈N

kψkkL∞(R).

Shift the origin at ξk and denote

ψk(ξk) = ε.

˜φk(ξ) = φk(ξ + ξk) and ˜ψk(ξ) = ψk(ξ + ξk).

From Lemma 4.2, the sequence { ˜ψk} is bounded in L∞(R). Remember also that 0 < ˜φk < 1
in R and ck → c∗ > 0 as k → +∞. Therefore, up to extraction of a subsequence, the functions
˜φk and ˜ψk converge in C ∞
loc(R) to some bounded C ∞(R) functions φ and ψ solving (1.3) with
speed c∗. Furthermore, 0 ≤ φ ≤ 1 and ψ ≥ 0 in R, while

ψ(0) = ε > 0.

In order to complete the proof of Theorem 1.1 in case c = c∗, one shall show that the
pair (φ, ψ) is non-trivial and satisﬁes the desired limiting conditions at ±∞, that is, the
conditions (1.5), (1.6) and (1.7) hold.

Let us ﬁrst show that

ψ > 0 in R.

Indeed, if there is ξ∗ ∈ R such that ψ(ξ∗) = 0, then ψ′(ξ∗) = 0 and equation (1.3) at ξ∗
yields ψ(ξ∗ ± 1) = 0, whence ψ(ξ∗ + m) = 0 for all m ∈ Z by immediate induction. But
c∗ψ′ ≥ −(2d + µ + γ) ψ in R, whence the function ξ 7→ ψ(ξ) e(2d+µ+γ)ξ/c∗
is nondecreasing.
Since ψ ≥ 0 in R and ψ(ξ∗ + m) = 0 for all m ∈ Z, one infers that ψ = 0 in R, which is
impossible since ψ(0) = ε > 0. Thus, ψ > 0 in R. Once the positivity of ψ is known, it
follows as in the proof of Lemma 3.1 that

0 < φ < 1 in R.

In other words, the pair (φ, ψ) fulﬁlls (1.5).

Let us then show that the pair (φ, ψ) satisﬁes the limiting conditions (1.6) at −∞. Since
the pair (φ, ψ) solves (1.3) and (1.5) with speed c∗, the choice of ε > 0 above and the
property ψ(0) = ε imply that ψ′ > 0 in (−∞, 0]. In particular, the limit L = limξ→−∞ ψ(ξ)
exists, and L ∈ [0, ε). If L > 0, then the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 3.9
imply that φ(−∞) exists and φ(−∞) = (µ + γ)/β = 1/σ ∈ (0, 1). The same arguments also

18

Y.-Y. CHEN, J.-S. GUO, AND F. HAMEL

yield L = ψ(−∞) = µ(1 − φ(−∞))/(βφ(−∞)) = (µ/β)(σ − 1) = e∗. Hence, e∗ = L < ε,
contradicting (4.3). Therefore,

L = ψ(−∞) = 0.

Furthermore, for any sequence { ˜ξk} converging to −∞, the functions ξ 7→ φ(ξ + ˜ξk) and
ξ 7→ ψ(ξ + ˜ξk) converge in C ∞
loc(R), up to extraction of a subsequence, to a pair (φ∞, 0), for
some function 0 ≤ φ∞ ≤ 1 solving (3.11) with speed c∞ = c∗. It follows as in the proof of
Lemma 3.8 that φ∞ = 1 in R. Since the limit does not depend on the choice the sequence
{ ˜ξk}, one gets that the limit limξ→−∞ φ(ξ) exists, and

φ(−∞) = 1.

In other words, the pair (φ, ψ) satisﬁes (1.6).

Let us ﬁnally show that the non-triviality conditions (1.7) hold at +∞. Firstly, as in the
proof of Lemma 3.7, there holds inf R φ > 0. Secondly, Lemma 3.8 and (1.5) imply at once
that lim inf ξ→+∞ ψ(ξ) > 0. Thirdly, one concludes that lim supξ→+∞ φ(ξ) < 1 as in the proof
of (3.6) and that (3.7) holds as in the case c > c∗. The solution (φ, ψ) thus fulﬁlls all desired
properties and the proof of Theorem 1.1 in case c = c∗ is thereby complete.
✷

5. Non-existence of traveling waves for c < c∗

In this section, (φ, ψ) denotes a classical solution of (1.3) satisfying (1.5) and (1.6), with
a speed c ∈ R. By classical, we mean that φ and ψ are of class C 1(R) (and then of class
C ∞(R)) if c 6= 0, and that φ and ψ are continuous if c = 0. We shall prove that, necessarily,
c ≥ c∗. To do so, we consider separately the cases c > 0, c < 0 and c = 0.

First case: c > 0. Since the positive function ψ satisﬁes

ψ′(ξ) ≥

d
c

ψ(ξ + 1) −

2d + µ + γ

c

ψ(ξ)

for all ξ ∈ R, Lemma 3.2 implies that the functions ξ 7→ ψ(ξ ± 1)/ψ(ξ) are bounded, and
then so is the function ξ 7→ ψ′(ξ)/ψ(ξ). Consider now any sequence {ξk} converging to −∞.
The positive functions

ξ 7→ ψk(ξ) :=

ψ(ξ + ξk)

ψ(ξk)

are locally bounded and they satisfy

c ψ′

k = d D[ψk] − (µ + γ) ψk + β φ(· + ξk) ψk in R.

Therefore, the functions ψ′
k are locally bounded too (remember that φ(−∞) = 1). From
Arzela-Ascoli theorem, up to extraction of a subsequence, the functions ψk converge locally
uniformly (and then in C 1

(5.1)

loc(R) from the above equation) to a function ψ∞ solving
c ψ′

∞ = d D[ψ∞] + (β − µ − γ) ψ∞ in R.

Furthermore, ψ∞ ≥ 0 in R and ψ∞(0) = 1. As in the proof of Lemma 3.8 for the function Ψ∞
solving (3.12), it follows that ψ∞ > 0 in R. Now, the function z = ψ′

∞/ψ∞ solves

(5.2)

z(x) = eR x+1

z(s)ds + eR x−1

x

z(s)ds − 2 +

TRAVELING WAVE FOR A LATTICE DYNAMICAL SYSTEM

Proposition 3.5 implies that the limits z(±∞) exist in R and are roots ω of the equation

c ω = d (eω + e−ω − 2) + β − µ − γ.

Since c > 0 and β > µ + γ, the roots must be positive and c ≥ c∗ by deﬁnition of c∗ in (1.4).
The proof of the necessity condition is thereby complete in the case c > 0.

Second case: c < 0. Denote Φ(ξ) = φ(−ξ) and Ψ(ξ) = ψ(−ξ). The functions Φ
and Ψ satisfy (1.3) and (1.5) with speed |c| > 0, together with the limiting conditions
(Φ(+∞), Ψ(+∞)) = (1, 0). Furthermore, since the positive function Ψ satisﬁes

Ψ′(ξ) ≥

d
|c|

Ψ(ξ + 1) −

2d + µ + γ

|c|

Ψ(ξ)

and (1.3) with spped |c|, it follows as in the above case c > 0 that the function Ψ′/Ψ is
bounded. Since Ψ > 0 in R and Ψ(+∞) = 0, one can consider a sequence {ξk} converging
to +∞ such that

Ψ′(ξk) ≤ 0 for all k ∈ N.

As above, up to extraction of a subsequence, the functions ξ 7→ Ψk(ξ) := Ψ(ξ + ξk)/Ψ(ξk)
converge in C 1
loc(R) to a positive solution Ψ∞ of (5.1) with |c| instead of c, and such that
Ψ∞(0) = 1. Furthermore, here, Ψ′
∞/Ψ∞ satisﬁes (5.2) with
|c| instead of c and it follows from Proposition 3.5 that the limits Z(±∞) exist in R and are
roots Ω of the equation

∞(0) ≤ 0. The function Z := Ψ′

|c| Ω = d (eΩ + e−Ω − 2) + β − µ − γ.

Since β > µ + γ, the roots are positive (and |c| ≥ c∗). In particular, Z is positive at ±∞.
But Z(0) = Ψ′
∞(0) ≤ 0. Hence, the continuous function Z has a minimum
Ξ in R, that is Z(Ξ) ≤ Z(ξ) for all ξ ∈ R. By diﬀerentiating the equation satisﬁed by Z,
one gets as in (3.14) that

∞(0)/Ψ∞(0) = Ψ′

|c| Z ′(ξ) = d (Z(ξ + 1) − Z(ξ))

Ψ∞(ξ + 1)

Ψ∞(ξ)

+ d (Z(ξ − 1) − Z(ξ))

Ψ∞(ξ − 1)

Ψ∞(ξ)

in R.

Hence, Z(Ξ ± 1) = Z(Ξ), and Z(Ξ + m) = Z(Ξ) = minR Z for all m ∈ Z by immediate
induction. Therefore, Z(±∞) = minR Z ≤ Z(0) ≤ 0, a contradiction with the positivity of
Z(±∞). As a consequence, the case c < 0 is ruled out.

Third case: c = 0. Here, the function ψ satisﬁes d D[ψ] + (β φ − µ − γ) ψ = 0 in R. Since
d > 0, β > µ + γ, φ(−∞) = 1 and ψ > 0 in R, it follows that there exists ξ0 ∈ R such that
D[ψ](ξ) < 0 for all ξ ≤ ξ0. Denote

θ(ξ) = ψ(ξ) − ψ(ξ + 1).

The condition D[ψ] < 0 in (−∞, ξ0] means that θ(ξ − 1) < θ(ξ) for all ξ ≤ ξ0. Furthermore,
since ψ > 0 in R and ψ(−∞) = 0, there is ξ1 ≤ ξ0 such that θ(ξ1) < 0. Since θ(ξ1−m) < θ(ξ1)
for all m ∈ N with m ≥ 1, one infers that

ψ(ξ1 − m) − ψ(ξ1) =

θ(ξ1 − j) < m θ(ξ1)

m

Xj=1

20

Y.-Y. CHEN, J.-S. GUO, AND F. HAMEL

for all m ∈ N with m ≥ 1. Thus, ψ(ξ1 − m) < ψ(ξ1) + m θ(ξ1) → −∞ as m → +∞ since
θ(ξ1) < 0. This contradicts the positivity of ψ. As a consequence, the case c = 0 is ruled
out too and the proof of Theorem 1.1 is thereby complete.
✷

Remark 5.1. We give here another proof of the positivity of c when ψ is bounded (cf. [25]).
Since φ(−∞) = 1 and β > µ + γ, there is a suﬃciently large K such that

β φ(ξ) − µ − γ >

β − µ − γ

2

> 0 for ξ ∈ (−∞, −K).

Integrating the second equation of (1.3) from −∞ to ξ < −K, using ψ(−∞) = 0 and the
positivity and boundedness of ψ, we obtain

c ψ(ξ) = d(cid:26)Z ξ+1

for all ξ < −K. It follows that the integral

second equation of (1.3) twice, we obtain
