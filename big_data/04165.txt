Abstract. We explore Schwinger eﬀect of spin 1/2 charged particles with static electric ﬁeld
in 1+3 dimensional de Sitter spacetime. We analytically calculate the vacuum expectation
value of the spinor current which is induced by the produced particles in the electric ﬁeld.
The renormalization is performed with the adiabatic subtraction scheme. We ﬁnd that the
current becomes negative, namely it ﬂows in the direction opposite to the electric ﬁeld, if the
electric ﬁeld is weaker than a certain threshold value depending on the fermion mass, which
is also known to happen in the case of scalar charged particles in 1+3 de Sitter spacetime.
Contrary to the scalar case, however, the IR hyperconductivity is absent in the spinor case.

The Schwinger eﬀect [1] is known as an intriguing example of non-perturbative phenomena
of quantum ﬁeld theory in a background ﬁeld. It describes production of pairs of charged
particles out of the quantum vacuum state due to a background electric ﬁeld.
It is still
diﬃcult to provide the electric ﬁeld strong enough to cause the particle production due to
Schwinger eﬀect in a laboratory. However, we expect that such a strong electric ﬁeld were
naturally present in the primordial universe in the context of inﬂationary magnetogenesis
which attempts to explain the origin of the observationally inferred large-scale magnetic
ﬁelds [2–6] in terms of the primordial magnetic ﬁelds generated during inﬂation [7]. 1

The observations of galactic and extra-galactic magnetic ﬁelds motivate the study of the
origin of these magnetic ﬁelds and inﬂationary magnetogenesis is considered as a promising
candidate as a way to achieve long enough coherent length. For instance, the kinetic coupling
model (or f 2F F model [10–13]), which is a well-studied model of inﬂationary magnetogenesis,
predicts that very strong electric ﬁelds are inevitably produced during inﬂation, if it generates
magnetic ﬁelds which are strong enough to leave observable signatures. It is also known that
the model cannot explain the lower bound on the present magnetic ﬁeld strength inferred
by the blazar observation, because of the overproduction of the electric ﬁelds whose energy
density spoils the inﬂationary background [14] or the observation of the cosmic microwave

background radiation [15].2 Nevertheless, no one has yet studied the model properly taking
into account Schwinger eﬀect, while it possibly changes the dynamics drastically. Therefore
the Schwinger pair production could occur in the inﬂationary era and it is important to
investigate it.

Regarding Schwinger eﬀect in de Sitter spacetime, two nontrivial backgrounds are in-
volved. These are electric ﬁeld and gravitational ﬁeld, both of which can cause the particle
production from the vacuum state. This combination of the diﬀerent production sources
makes the problem challenging and interesting. Furthermore, the background ﬁelds are not
completely static in realistic situations and the backreaction to the electric ﬁeld is important
especially in the context of magnetogenesis. Flowing through the electric ﬁeld, the produced
particles induce the electric current and it aﬀects the background electric ﬁeld. The induced
electric current which characterizes the size of the backreaction can be quantitatively evalu-
ated by the vacuum expectation value of the current operator. Note that the induced electric
current is a well-deﬁned physical quantity since it only requires to specify the in-vacuum
state, while the Bogoliubov coeﬃcients which can give the particle production rate depend
also on the deﬁnition of the out-vacuum state.

Recently, a number of studies of this eﬀect in de Sitter spacetime have appeared [19–24].
Their motivations diverge into many branches of quantum physics from false vacuum decay
and bubble nucleation to a thermal interpretation of particle production or cosmological
consequences including magnetogenesis. Schwinger eﬀect and its induced current in de Sitter
spacetime for a scalar charged particle have been investigated both in the 1 + 1 dimension
case [21], in the 1 + 2 dimension case [25] and the 1 + 3 case [23].
In those works, it is
found that the scalar induced current is strongly enhanced for the small mass ﬁeld and
weak electric ﬁeld regime. This phenomenon was called IR hyperconductivity and found
in [21] for the ﬁrst time.
In [23], the authors reported a negative current which ﬂows in
a direction against the electric ﬁeld in addition to the IR hyperconductivity. In the 1 + 3
dimensional case, it was also found the terms which are not suppressed by the exponential
factor exp(−πm2/eE) or exp(−2πm/H) appear in the massive ﬁeld limit. These suppression
factors are naturally expected from the semiclassical approximation. Thus it suggests the
breakdown of the semiclassical description in the massive limit. For spinor charged particle,
however, the induced current has been calculated only in the case of 1+1 dimensional de Sitter
spacetime [24]. In [24], the authors have shown that there is neither the IR hyperconductivity
nor the negativity of the current.

To calculate the induced electric current in the real space, one has to address the
divergence coming from vacuum contribution. In [23, 24], the adiabatic subtraction method
[26, 27] was employed to remove the divergences in the vacuum expectation value of the
induced current.
It is known that the WKB (adiabatic) expansion for a fermionic ﬁeld
cannot satisfy the equation of motion while satisfying the normalization condition to all
orders of the expanding parameter . Nevertheless, the equivalence of the adiabatic and the
DeWitt-Schwinger renormalization schemes was shown in [28], and there are applications of
the adiabatic regularization of fermionic ﬁelds recently [29, 30].

In this paper, we calculate the induced current for spinor QED in 1 + 3 dimensional de
Sitter space. We consider a static background electric ﬁeld whose energy density is constant
even in expanding de Sitter spacetime and employ the adiabatic subtraction as the regu-
larization method. We analytically obtain the vacuum expectation value of the fermionic

current and compare it with the scalar particle case and the semiclassical approximation
[31]. Furthermore, its weak/strong electric ﬁeld limit and large mass limit are investigated in
depth with the curious features found in the previous works in mind, such as the IR hyper-
conductivity, the negative current and the terms without the exponential mass suppression.
We also discuss the stability of the background electric ﬁeld considering the backreaction
eﬀect indicated by the electric current.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we introduce the treatment of the
Dirac spinor in curved spacetime with clarifying our notation and solve the Dirac equation in
a background electric ﬁeld. In Sec. 3, the calculation of the induced current is described. The
property of the renormalized current is investigated in Sec. 4. Finally, Section 5 is devoted
to the conclusion. Technical details can be found in appendices.

2.1 QED action in curved spacetime

We start with the action for spinor quantum electrodynamics (QED) in curved spacetime,

(2.1)

where the metric sign is chosen as (− + ++). The covariant derivative Dµ is written in terms
of U(1) gauge ﬁeld Aµ and spinor connection Γµ as

Dµ(x) ≡ ∂µ + ieAµ(x) + Γµ(x),

(2.2)

Introducing the tetrads eµ

which ensures the local gauge symmetry and covariance. Fµν = ∇µAν − ∇νAµ is the gauge
ﬁeld strength.
a (a, b, c··· = 0, 1, 2, 3 are indices for the Local Lorentz Trans-
formation (LLT) and the Greek indices µ, ν ··· are for spacetime) and the generators Σab of
the LLT which obey the algebra [Σab, Σcd] = (ηacΣdb − ηbcΣda) − (ηadΣcb − ηbdΣca), one can
write down the spinor connection as

For the Dirac spinor ψ, which is the reducible ( 1

the generators are given by Σab = − 1
4[γa, γb]. Here, the gamma matrices satisfy the anti-
commutation relation {γa, γb} = −2ηab with ηab = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1) being the Minkowski
metric.

where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time η. It is clearly shown
that the conformal symmetry is recovered for massless fermion case, m = 0.

2.2 Dirac equation in EM background

The equation of motion for ξ ﬁeld (the Dirac equation) is given by

(2.9)
Substituting ξ = (iγa∂a − eAaγa + ma)ζ into Eq. (2.9), we obtain the quadratic Dirac
equation,

(iγa∂a − eAaγa − ma)ξ(η, x) = 0.

where all the indices should be contracted by the Minkowski metric ηab.

Hereafter we consider that a homogeneous electric background ﬁeld Aµ(x) = (0, 0, 0, Az (η))

exists in de Sitter spacetime (i.e. a′/a2 = H = cosnt.). We also assume that the background
ﬁeld Az is given by

We ﬁnd there exist four time-independent eigenvectors ws (s = 1, 2, 3, 4) of a matrix B ≡
(M 2 + L2)−1/2(M γ0 + Lγ0γ3),
(2.15)
which have eigenvalues λs = +1 (for s = 1, 2) or λs = −1 (for s = 3, 4) respectively. Note
that B is traceless. The normalization and the completeness condition are given by

Charge conjugation operator C is deﬁned by

where tγµ denotes the transpose of the gamma matrices, and the Hermitian/anti-Hermitian
properties of the gamma matrices (γµ)† = γ0γµγ0 indicate that C B∗C−1 = C tBC−1 = −B.
Then we ﬁnd B(Cw∗s ) = −λs(Cw∗s ). We specify

(2.18)

with C = −C−1 = C∗ = −C†.
following decomposition of the solution for the Dirac equation:

With the aid of the spatial homogeneity of the system we consider, we introduce the

ζ(η, x) = e−iHLzeik·xζk, s(η)ws,

(2.19)

where we add a gauge ﬁxing phase factor e−iHLz for later convenience. The Schr¨odinger type
equation for the mode function is then obtained as

The in-vacuum state |0i is deﬁned as a state that satisﬁes the condition bk, s |0i = dk, s |0i =

commutation relation Eq. (2.29), the expectation value of the spinor current operator J 3
(along z-axis) is expressed as

and we have used the normalization condition Eq. (A.5) (see Appendix A) in the last line.
Clearly, this integral diverges in the ultraviolet(UV) region (k → ∞) and some renormaliza-
tion procedure is required. In this paper, we apply the adiabatic subtraction method.

3.2 Adiabatic subtraction

The adiabatic subtraction is a renormalization scheme with which one subtracts the lower-
order parts in the adiabatic (WKB) expansion of a quantity from its unrenormalized cal-
culation result. The leading term in the adiabatic expansion of the expectation value of
the current −eh0|ˆ¯ξγ3 ˆξ|0i(cid:12)(cid:12)
(A) imitates the divergence(s) in the UV (large k) region in the
momentum space. Here, −eh0|ˆ¯ξγ3 ˆξ|0i(cid:12)(cid:12)
(A) is obtained by replacing the mode function ζ +
(A). Subtracting this quantity from
by the adiabatically (WKB) expanded counterpart ζ +(cid:12)(cid:12)
the formally divergent expectation value −eh0|ˆ¯ξγ3 ˆξ|0i, one obtains the renormalized expec-

tation value of the current operator. We perform these calculations in this subsection (see
also Appendix B).

In this subsection, we recover  to make things much clearer. The equation of motion

for ζ = ζ +

k, s=1,2 is, again, given by

η + ω2

(cid:0)2∂2

k(η) − iσ(η)(cid:1) ζ(η) = 0.

(3.4)

Because the −iσ term in the equation above comes from ﬁrst-order derivative, we have to
assign 1 in front of it. This odd order term is peculiar to the spinor case (does not appear
in the scalar case), and the usual WKB ansatz, which is valid for the scalar mode function,

is inappropriate (Ωk is a function to be determined as a power series of ).
Instead, the
WKB ansatz for spinor should take the following form [28–30, 33] (see Appendix B for the
derivation),

ζ =r

(1 + F (1) + 2F (2) + ··· ) e−i/ R dη′(ω+ω(1)+2ω(2)+··· ),

where F (i)s and ω(i)s are (real) unknown functions to be determined by the equation of
motion Eq. (3.4) and the normalization condition

2ζ′(ζ∗)′ − iFk(ζ(ζ∗)′ − ζ′ζ∗) + ω2

k|ζ|2 = 1,

(3.7)

where we have recovered . Note that this normalization condition can be satisﬁed only
perturbatively (in an order-by-order manner). More detailed explanation on this ansatz is
shown in Appendix B. We ﬁnd all the odd order terms vanish, that is, F (1) = F (3) = ··· = 0
and ω(1) = ω(3) = ··· = 0. We can express F (i) and ω(i) in terms of ω and σ. For example,
at the second order they read

introduce a momentum cutoﬀ Λ to control the divergences. Second, the momentum integrals
of the exact part (the ﬁrst term in Eq. (3.9)) and the adiabatic part (the second term) are
computed separately. Third, the subtraction is done, while the momentum cutoﬀ Λ is kept
ﬁnite. Finally, we take the limit Λ → ∞ and obtain a ﬁnite result.

Implications of the result

We investigate the renormalized current Eq. (3.12) in this section. To this end, we introduce a
dimensionless quantity J which is a function of the two dimensionless parameters L = eE/H 2
(electric ﬁeld strength) and M = m/H (spinor mass),

J (L, M ) ≡ |hJ 3iren |
ea3H 3 .

(4.1)

In Fig. 1, behaviors of the spinor current J (L, M ) (solid line) and the corresponding scalar
current found in [23] (dashed line) are shown.
We have doubled the value of the bosonic current for comparison, since the spinor has
two spin degrees of freedom. We can see the agreement between the bosonic and fermionic
current in the strong electric ﬁeld region L ≫ 1, M 2. However, they show diﬀerent behaviors
for L . 1, M 2.

4.1 General property
J (L, M ) has some remarkable properties. The most intelligible one is an antisymmetry
J (L, M ) = −J (−L, M ) and its consequence J (0, M ) = 0. This means that the renormalized
current always vanishes at L = 0 as expected. However, J (L, M ) also becomes zero at a
certain positive L depending on M , namely L∗(M ) > 0, for any value of the mass parameter
M . The spinor renormalized current is positive for L > L∗, and is negative for L < L∗. The
negative spinor current is always (for any value of M ) observed in the weak electric ﬁeld
regime in contrast with the bosonic case which shows the negative current only in the small
mass regime Mscalar . 0.003.

Another striking diﬀerence between the bosonic and the fermionic current is the absence
of the IR hyperconductivity which is the rapid growth of |J | for smaller L. The hypercon-
ductivity happens only in IR regime (L < 1 and M < 1). It was ﬁrst found and discussed
for the bosonic current in the 1 + 1 dimensional de Sitter spacetime [21] and that in the 1 + 3
dimensional de Sitter spacetime [23]. In Fig. 1, one can see it as the peak of the bosonic cur-
rent (dashed line) at L ≈ 10−3 and 10−2 for M = 10−3 and 10−2, respectively. Nevertheless,
we ﬁnd that there is not such a peak or the enhancement of the fermionic current in the IR
regime except for a weak logarithmic divergence log m (see the next subsection for details).
The absence of the hyperconductivity of the fermionic current in the 1 + 1 dimensional de
Sitter spacetime is also reported in [24].

Figure 1. The renormalized spinor current (solid) and the doubled scalar current (dashed) induced
by Schwinger eﬀect in 1 + 3 de Sitter space are shown. The horizontal axis denotes the strength of the
electric ﬁeld L ≡ eE/H 2. The mass parameter of the charged particles are M ≡ m/H = 10−3(blue),
10−2(orange), 1.5(green) and 10(red). The absolute value |J | is plotted and its sign ﬂips around
L ∼ 10 in the spinor case with any mass and the scalar case with a suﬃciently small mass.

4.2 Strong and weak ﬁeld limits
In the strong electric ﬁeld limit, L ≫ 1, M , the second line of Eq. (3.12) dominates the
expectation value and we obtain (for L > 0)

(4.2)

where the famous suppression factor of Schwinger eﬀect in Minkowski spacetime exp(−πm2/eE)
is reproduced. We can also ﬁnd the quadratic behavior (J ∼ L2) of the renormalized current
which is the same as the scalar (bosonic) current. This strong electric ﬁeld limit corresponds
to the Minkowski (weak curvature) limit H → 0. Thus, there is H−1 divergence in hJiren
in this limit. This is caused by the lack of cosmic dilution in this limit. The particle pro-
If we regulate the H−1 divergence
duced at t = −∞ contributes to the current forever.
by the cosmic time interval (t − t0) with t0 being the turn-on time of the electric ﬁeld, we
obtain hJiren ∼ e3E2(t − t0) exp(−πm2/eE). This linear growth in time is consistent with
the previous work of Schwinger eﬀect in Minkowski spacetime shown in [34].
In contrast to the intuitive behavior in the strong ﬁeld limit, the strange negativity
of the renormalized current appears in the weak electric ﬁeld regime L ≪ 1. In this limit,
Eq. (3.12) becomes

We can deﬁne a dimensionless conductivity in the weak electric ﬁeld limit as σ(M ) =

where γE is the Euler constant. There is no power-law IR enhancement but the logarithmic
divergence for the spinor conductivity. On the other hand, the bosonic conductivity has a
much faster enhancement in proportional to M−2, which is called the IR hyperconductivity,
in the small mass limit, M → 0. The massive limit is given by

e−2πM M (4M 2 + 1).

(4.5)

As expected, σ(M ) is suppressed in the massive limit. Schwinger mechanism cannot produce
massive fermions eﬀectively due to the suppression factor exp(−πm2/eE). The gravitational
particle production is also suppressed by the factor (exp(2πM ) + 1)−1 ∼ exp(−2πM ). Thus
we might be able to identify the latter term in Eq. (4.5) as the eﬀect of the gravitational
particle production. Nevertheless, we do not have any satisfactory explanation for its negative
sign. Moreover, the terms in the parenthesis in Eq. (4.5) do not have exponential suppression
factors and cannot be simply attributed to either of Schwinger or the gravitational particle
production. Their origins are still unidentiﬁed but we further discuss it in the next subsection.
Here, we note that the higher order adiabatic subtraction can remove some of these terms
with the power-law dependence on M . For instance, the ﬁrst term with M−2 in Eq. (4.5)
can be removed by the adiabatic subtraction of order 4, while it adds a new O(L3/M 2)
term to the induced current and changes the IR behavior of the current. Nevertheless, the
higher order (O(M−4)) terms which are not suppressed by the exponential factor in (4.5)
still remain even in this case.

4.3 Negativity of the induced current

It is questionable whether we should take the strange negativity of the current seriously. The
range of wavelength which is short enough to verify the adiabatic subtraction depends on the
particle mass, and only the modes with (k/aH)2 + M 2 ≫ 1 can imitate the correct behavior
of the exact mode function. Thus, the adiabatic approximation is not necessarily correct for
the long wavelength modes when m ≪ H. A possible criticism is that the adiabatic expansion
is inappropriate for ﬁelds with extremely small masses and the adiabatic subtraction scheme
becomes invalid for the modes with m/H ≪ k/(aH) ≪ 1 though they are in the UV regime.
However, it has been conﬁrmed in [35] that the point splitting renormalization scheme
is in perfect accord with the adiabatic subtraction for the scalar current. This implies that
the strange behaviors we have found in the previous section have nothing to do with the
accuracy of the WKB expansion in infrared regime. Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate
physical consequences of the result, Eq. (3.12), in this section.

The semiclassical equation of motion for the gauge ﬁeld is given by F µν

,ν = hJ µiren in
our convention. For the electric background ﬁeld Ez = −A ′z, the equation of motion is given
by
(4.6)

E ′z = −hJ 3iren ,

which can be regarded as a feedback system.
It is easy to ﬁgure out the stability of the
electric ﬁeld-current system by looking at the signature of the renormalized current. The

– 11 –

positive current reduces the background electric ﬁeld while the negative current enhances it.
The zeros of the current correspond to either a stable point or a saddle (unstable) point.

Surprisingly enough, the trivial zero L = 0 (E = 0) is not a stable point but a saddle
point. This situation is opposite of the case of the scalar current. Another zero L = L∗ > 0
is always a stable point. We plot L∗ as a function of M = m/H in Fig. 2. This ﬁgure
can be seen as a phase diagram of the system. The negative current occurs in the region
below the blue line. A similar diagram for the scalar current is discussed also in [35]. Note
that the negativity of the induced current is not past redemption even though it indicates
the instability of the system. This is not a bottomless instability since the current becomes
positive for a suﬃciently strong electric ﬁeld.

Figure 2. Zero of the renormalized current J (L, M ) in L-M plain. The upper region corresponds
to the positive current J > 0 (negative feedback) and the lower region corresponds to the negative
current J < 0 (positive feedback). The line shows positions of the stable points of the electric
ﬁeld-current system.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have investigated the fermionic current induced by Schwinger eﬀect in
1 + 3 dimensional de Sitter spacetime. We have considered a homogeneous electric ﬁeld
Eq. (2.11) which has the constant energy density in the expanding universe. Using the
adiabatic subtraction, we obtained the renormalized expectation value of the current operator
for the charged fermion. The analytic result Eq. (3.12) was studied in detail and the similarity
and diﬀerence from the bosonic (scalar) case were discussed.

With the aid of the analytic result Eq. (3.12), we managed to investigate the behaviors
of the induced current in both the weak and strong electric ﬁeld limits. In the strong ﬁeld
limit, we obtained Eq. (4.2) which coincides with the behavior of the bosonic current [23] as
well as that of the current in ﬂat spacetime [34]. Since the contribution to the induced current
mainly comes from Schwinger pair production in strong ﬁeld regime, the induced current in
this regime carries the mass suppression factor for the Schwinger eﬀect exp(−πm2/eE) as

– 12 –

expected. On the other hand, in the weak electric ﬁeld regime, we have found two remarkable
features, namely the absence of the IR hyperconductivity and the negativity of the induced
current. These features have been observed in the 1 + 1 dimensional fermionic case [24] and
the 1 + 3 dimensional bosonic case [23], respectively. In our case, the negative current occurs
for the electric ﬁeld smaller than a certain value L∗(m/H) determined by the spinor mass
as plotted in Fig. 2. Although the negativity of the current indicates the positive feedback
which counter-intuitively enhances the background electric ﬁeld, it does not mean an un-
bounded instability. The system is stable for electric ﬁeld which is stronger than L∗(m/H)
and thus the electric ﬁeld is not enhanced beyond L∗ due to the instability. We also found
the terms which do not carry any exponential mass suppression factor in the massive spinor
limit of the conductivity Eq. (4.5).
If the particle is suﬃciently heavy, the semiclassical
description must be precise and it suggests that the exponential mass suppression factors
such as exp(−πm2/eE) or exp(−2πm/H) should appear. Thus, these terms indicate contri-
butions beyond the semiclassical approximations. Further investigation is needed to clarify
the origin or the physical interpretation of the negative current and the terms without the
exponential mass suppression. It should be noted that the expression for the renormalized
current Eq. (3.12) apparently has a logarithmic divergence in the massless limit which has
been introduced by the adiabatic subtraction, while the current vanishes in the massive limit
without divergence.

Our result is a signiﬁcant step towards understanding the electromagnetic response of
the inﬂationary spacetime. However, we need further study to obtain general implications
from Schwinger eﬀect for inﬂationary magnetogenesis. This is because in this paper we
have restricted ourselves to the following two points: (i) We have focused only on the speciﬁc
background gauge ﬁeld conﬁguration which scales as Az ∝ (a−1), though the kinetic coupling
model produces a gauge ﬁeld with Ai ∝ as (s is a real parameter of the model) [13] which
may not be approximated by the setup in the present paper. (ii) We have not considered the
realistic dynamics of the gauge ﬁeld with the backreaction eﬀect from the particle production.

Let X be a matrix constructed from the eigenvectors ws in Eq. (2.15) as

wsw†s.

X ≡ Xs=1, 2

(A.1)

X should be a Hermitian matrix (X† = X) due to the orthogonality of the eigenvectors ws.

B Adiabatic expansion for spinor mode function

In order to ﬁnd the consistent WKB expansion Eq. (3.6) for the equation of motion Eq. (3.4),

we examine the most primitive WKB-type ansatz such as ζ = exp(±−1R η dη′(X(η′) + iY (η′)))

– 14 –

where X and Y are real functions to be determined by the equation of motion. Substituting
it into Eq. (3.4), one ﬁnds

X 2 − Y 2 ± X′ = −ω2,

2XY ± Y ′ = σ.

(B.1)

Note that X (Y ) has only odd (even) order terms in the power series expansion of , respec-
tively. The latter of Eq. (B.1) reads X = ∓ 1

a normalization factor N to rewrite the ansatz as ζ = N√Y

Since Cs and Ct can be taken to ensure ℜ(s + t) > 0, we can perform the k-integral

the residues from the poles at s = −iLx,−iLx − 1,−iLx − 2,−iLx − 3. The non-vanishing

x-integral cannot be expressed in terms of simpler functions, but it is real since the imaginary
part of the digamma function is given by 2ℑψ(iy) = 1/y + π coth(πy).
The other part (residues from t = −s − 2,−s − 3) is calculated as
