ABSTRACT
In the broad line region of AGN, acceleration occurs naturally when a cloud condenses
out of the hot conﬁning medium due to the increase in line opacity as the cloud cools.
However, acceleration by radiation pressure is not very eﬃcient when the ﬂux is time-
independent, unless the ﬂow is one-dimensional. Here we explore how acceleration is
aﬀected by a time-varying ﬂux, as AGN are known to be highly variable. If the period of
ﬂux oscillations is longer than the thermal timescale, we expect the gas to cool during
the low ﬂux state, and therefore line opacity should quickly increase. The cloud will
receive a small kick due to the increased radiation force. We perform hydrodynamical
simulations using Athena to conﬁrm this eﬀect and quantify its importance. We ﬁnd
that despite the ﬂow becoming turbulent in 2D due to hydrodynamic instabilities, a
20% modulation of the ﬂux leads to a net increase in acceleration — by more than
a factor of 2 — in both 1D and 2D. We show that this is suﬃcient to produce the
observed line widths, although we only consider optically thin clouds. We discuss the
implications of our results for photoionization modeling and reverberation mapping.

1 INTRODUCTION

Broad line region (BLR) clouds are central components of
uniﬁcation models for active galactic nuclei (AGN) (e.g., An-
tonucci 1993; Urry & Padovani 1995) and form the basis of
many photoionization and dynamical modeling eﬀorts (see
Netzer 2008, 2015 for recent reviews). Dating as far back to
the ﬁrst models invoking BLR clouds are other studies point-
ing out shortcomings with this picture (for an overview, see
e.g., Krolik 1999; Netzer 2013). As summarized by Rees et
al. (1989), BLR clouds are unstable to drag and radiation
pressure forces when they move supersonically through a hot
conﬁning medium (e.g., Krolik 1977; Mathews & Blumenthal
1977), while the standard two-phase model of Krolik, Mc-
Kee, & Tarter (1981) predicts unrealistically high tempera-
tures if clouds are not to move supersonically. The concern
is that disruptive processes prevent clouds from reaching the
high velocities necessary to account for the widths of broad
emission lines in AGN.

In Proga & Waters (2015; hereafter Paper 1), we revis-
ited this longstanding problem and proposed that a newly
forming cloud can be accelerated to a high velocity be-
cause as the thermally unstable gas condenses, its opacity
increases, and that alone enhances the transfer of momen-

tum from the radiation ﬁeld to the cloud. While we demon-
strated that this mechanism works in 1D, we conﬁrmed that
clouds are indeed disrupted in 2D by hydrodynamical insta-
bilities. Compared to 1D, the acceleration of the resulting
turbulent, two-phase medium was more than a factor of 5
times smaller.

Motivated by multi-wavelength observations of rapid
variability (on timescales of hours to days) that are over-
all suggestive of AGN variability being intrinsic rather than
absorption driven (see Uttley & Casella 2014 for a review), in
this paper we set out to relax our assumption of a constant
ﬂux and show that this can further enhance the coupling
between the gas and radiation ﬁeld. To see that a time-
varying ﬂux leads to an additional acceleration mechanism,
note the expected asymmetric response of gas that is not
fully ionized: during low ﬂux states when the gas can cool,
the increase in the radiation pressure force can be substantial
because the line opacity is a sensitive function of tempera-
ture.

This letter is organized as follows. In §2 we discuss our
modiﬁcations to the methods developed in Paper 1. In §3, we
present our results, verifying that this acceleration mecha-
nism is realized, even in 2D. In §4 we discuss the implications
of these results and show that highly supersonic velocities
are obtainable on time and length scales consistent with typ-
ical BLR parameters.

2 METHODS

Using Athena (Stone et al. 2008), we numerically solve the
following equations of hydrodynamics:

+ ∇ · (ρv) = 0,

∂ρ
∂t

∂ (ρv)

∂t

+ ∇ · (ρvv + p I) = frad,

(1)

(2)

+ ∇ · [(E + p)v] = −ρL + κeq∇2T + frad · v.

∂E
(3)
∂t
Here, (ρ, v, p) are the primitive ﬂuid variables, I is the
unit tensor, frad is the radiation force (see below), and
E = p/(γ − 1) + ρv2/2 is the total energy density, with
γ = 5/3 the adiabatic index. Our net cooling function L de-
pends on both the temperature T and the photoionization
parameter ξ = 4πFion/n, where Fion is the ionizing ﬂux inci-
dent on the gas and n = ρ/µmp is the number density (µ = 1
in this work). The function L accounts for Compton heat-
ing/cooling and losses to due to bremsstrahlung using stan-
dard analytic expressions, as well as X-ray heating/cooling
and cooling due to line emission using ﬁts from photoion-
ization calculations given by Blondin (1994; Blondin’s ex-
pressions are reproduced in Paper 1). These calculations as-
sumed a TX = 10 keV/kB bremsstrahlung spectrum incident
on optically thin gas of cosmic abundances. We estimate the
conduction coeﬃcient κeq using the value for a fully ionized
plasma (Spitzer 1962) evaluated at the radiative equilibrium
temperature Teq, deﬁned by L(ξ, Teq) = 0.

The above equations diﬀer from those solved in Paper 1

only by the introduction of an oscillating ionizing ﬂux,

Fion(t) = FX + ∆FX (t) = FX (1 + AX sin(2πωX t)) ,

(4)

where AX and ωX denote the amplitude and frequency
of oscillations. The constant (time-averaged) ionizing ﬂux
FX is set once values for the photoionization parameter
and number density characteristic of the AGN environ-
ment are chosen, i.e. FX = neq ξeq/4π. We adopt the val-
ues ξeq = 190 erg cm s−1 and neq = 1014/Teq, yielding
neq = 5.17 × 108 cm−3 and FX = 7.82 × 109 erg s−1cm−2.
This choice leads to the formation of a cloud with the high-
est possible density that still permits the cloud to remain
optically thin, throughout its evolution, to the transitions
contributing to the line driving.

The radiation ﬁeld incident on the gas is approximated
as consisting only of the time-dependent ionizing ﬂux Fion(t)
and a constant non-ionizing ﬂux FU V . This distinction is
made to separate the high-energy photons responsible for
setting the heating/cooling rates from the lower energy pho-
tons that only contribute to the radiation force (through
Thomson and line scattering). Then the radiation force, as-
sumed to be due to a distant source, is

(cid:105)

(cid:104)

frad =

ρσe
c

(1 + Mmax)FU V + (1 + σX )Fion(t)

ˆr.

(5)

Here σe is the mass scattering coeﬃcient for free electrons,
Mmax is the force multiplier quantifying the enhancement
of scattering opacity due to spectral lines, and σX is an
eﬀective bound-free opacity (in units of µmpσe), which is
self-consistently determined from the X-ray heating rate (see
Paper 1). In the optically thin limit that we explore, the force

multiplier takes on its maximum value and is just the sum of
the opacity contributions from all spectral lines (Castor et
al. 1975; Owocki et al. 1988). A minor technical modiﬁcation
to the prescription for Mmax used in Paper 1 was required in
order to properly study the eﬀects of a time-varying ﬂux: we
mapped the increase in line opacity from ξ to T , since the
primary physical dependence is on temperature, which maps
one-to-one onto ξ, but only for a constant ﬂux. To complete
the speciﬁcation of the radiation force, we quantify FU V in
terms of FX by introducing the parameter fU V ≡ FU V /FX ,
which we ﬁx at 10.

As in Paper 1, our initial conditions are the solutions
to the linearized versions of equations (1)-(3) (neglecting
frad) that describe the evolution of a thermally unstable
isobaric condensation mode (eqs. 11-14 in Field 1965). The
amplitude of the density perturbation was increased from
δρ/ρeq = 5 × 10−5 to δρ/ρeq = 0.1 in order to shorten the
duration of the initial phase of cloud evolution; this had
no noticeable eﬀect on subsequent evolution. We use peri-
odic boundary conditions in order to track the acceleration
of the cloud over many domain lengths (a domain length
is lx = 3.11 × 1010 cm). Our simulations were performed
on a uniform grid with resolution Nx = 1024 in 1D and
[Nx, Ny] = [2048, 1024] in 2D.

The eﬀects of a time-varying ﬂux would be minimal
if clouds evaporated back into the conﬁning medium at a
much higher rate than new clouds are created. In an up-
coming paper, we will present the results of a study dedi-
cated to exploring a wide variety of initial conditions and
cloud morphologies, all of which are suggestive of a scenario
in which continuous cloud production can sustain a signif-
icant cloud mass fraction despite losses from evaporation.
For the present study, this ﬁnding implies that a turbulent
ﬂow regime with qualitatively similar properties is reached
nearly independent of the initial conditions. Hence, it suf-
ﬁces to simply consider the simulations from Paper 1 and
run them for a longer time.

3 RESULTS

We ran over 20 simulations to explore the parameter space
(AX and ωX ) introduced by the time-varying ﬂux. Typical
rms variability amplitudes observed in reverberation map-
ping campaigns are (cid:46) 20% (e.g., De Rosa et al. 2015). For
amplitudes this small, we expect there to be a limited range
of periods tX = 1/ωX that can signiﬁcantly aﬀect cloud ac-
celeration. If the ﬂux varies rapidly, such that tX (cid:28) tth, the
gas will not have time to respond. The opposite regime with
tX (cid:29) tth would likely be very ineﬃcient, as our results show
that each low ﬂux state provides a gentle ‘kick’ to the cloud.
Here we present results for two simulations carried out
in both 1D and 2D. Runs CF1D and CF2D (CF for ‘constant
ﬂux’) are identical to the ﬁducial runs from Paper 1; VF1D
and VF2D (VF for ‘variable ﬂux’) are new simulations and
diﬀer only by the introduction of ∆FX (t). We adopted tX =
5 tth ≈ 0.35 days. We do not introduce this time-varying ﬂux
until the cloud has fully formed. In practice, we set AX = 0
if t < 25 tth and AX = 0.2 for t ≥ 25 tth.

ﬂux. Red and blue colors denote averages over gas that is above and below, respectively, the equilibrium temperature Teq = 1.93× 105 K.
In the top panel, frad is plotted in units of the force from Thomson scattering for gas with T = Teq, namely fT = ρeqσe(FU V + FX )/c
[g cm−2s−2]. The grey region highlights the quarter cycle corresponding to the solutions plotted in Figure 2. The velocity panel shows
that a 20% variation in ﬂux increases the net ﬂow acceleration by about 240%.

3.1 1D Simulations

In Paper 1 we showed that equations (1)-(3) reach a simple
steady state solution in 1D when the ﬂux is constant. Here
the 1D solutions are much more complex and naturally time-
dependent, but they are perfectly cyclic in that proﬁles of the
solution at late times satisfy q(x, t) = q(x, t+tX )+q0, where
q is any variable and q0 is a constant. This property is most
easily shown by plotting spatially averaged quantities over
time, as shown in Figure 1. Here the instantaneous values of
the radiation force and primitive variables are averaged over
the hot gas (T > Teq; red curves) and cold gas (T < Teq; blue
curves). Since the density and pressure averages are bounded
by the same values for t (cid:38) 40 tth, we have q0 = 0 for ρ and
p, indicating that a stable conﬁguration permitting cyclic
episodes of enhanced cloud acceleration has been reached.
For comparison, the dotted lines in Figure 1 are these same
quantities for run CF1D.

Comparing red and blue curves in Figure 1, we see
that our basic expectations are conﬁrmed: low ﬂux states
lead to decreases in temperature, which for the cold gas re-
sults in accompanying increases in density (due to the ten-
dency to maintain pressure equilibrium) as well as corre-
sponding increases in the radiation force. At t = 25 tth, the
ﬂux oscillations commence, beginning with a high state from
t = 25.0 − 27.5 tth. The resulting increase in temperature is
reﬂected by the initial rise in pressure in the bottom panel,
and the cold and hot gas pressures are closely in sync, ex-
plaining the initial drop in the density of cold gas. (The
much smaller rise in the density of the hot gas is slightly de-
layed, indicating that this is a hydrodynamic response to the
cold gas.) The ‘kick’ imparted by the radiation force hap-
pens in the next quarter cycle from t = 27.5− 28.75 tth. The
grey shaded region highlights this interval at a later time,

with values of ∆FX /FX shown in the legend. The dotted proﬁles

showing that the slope of the velocity is steepest during this
quarter cycle.

When time-varying radiation forces are involved, this term
is important.

In Figure 2 we investigate the detailed dynamics of the
cloud during this acceleration phase of the cycle. The two
thick lines are proﬁles of the solution corresponding to times
at the boundaries of the shaded region in Figure 1. The top
panel shows that a 20% variation in ﬂux leads to more than
an order of magnitude increase in the radiation force for run
VF1D compared to run CF1D during this phase of the cy-
cle. The cloud responds to this force by dramatically altering
its conﬁguration. For the cloud to remain in near pressure
equilibrium with the hot medium and yet cool (reﬂected by
the overall decrease in pressure in the bottom panel), its
density must increase. This in turn can only occur through
a bulk transfer of mass from the hot medium, hence the
prominent positive and negative peaks on the velocity pro-
ﬁle, which are maintained for about a third of the quarter
cycle. This advective mass transport though both interfaces
of the cloud suddenly becomes much weaker through the
left interface (see the thin dashed line), leading to a marked
density increase of the leading edge of the cloud. Meanwhile,
the pressure gradient in the core has progressively steep-
ened, indicative of the increasing drag as the radiation force
increases.

The ﬁnal velocity proﬁle (thick dashed line) indicates
that the bulk mass transfer opposes continued growth and
will instead lead to a net expansion of the cloud. In the next
quarter cycle (not shown, but see Figure 1), the cloud den-
sity drops back to its starting level in Figure 2, and then
continues to further decrease as the ﬂux increases, caus-
ing the temperature to rise and the cloud to expand. The
term representing p dV work, p∇· v, is critical for mediating
the transition between high and low ﬂux states. However,
in the steady state p dV work does not play a role since
∇ · v = −ρ−1Dρ/Dt, and Dρ/Dt reaches 0 for run CF1D.

3.2 2D Simulations

The setup for our 2D simulations is the same as in Paper 1:
we arrange for a plane parallel cloud (a slab) to be formed
by making the magnitude of the density perturbation in the
y-direction 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the x-
direction: (δρ)y/ρeq = 10−3. This perturbation triggers the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability, as the core of the slab is slightly
‘heavier’ than its surroundings under the eﬀective gravity of
the radiation force, and it ‘falls’ into the hot medium. At t =
25 tth when we apply the variable ﬂux, the Rayleigh-Taylor
plume is fully developed (and similar to the conﬁguration
shown in the top right panel of Figure 4 in Paper 1).

Figure 3 is the 2D counterpart to Figure 1. A two-phase
medium clearly exists for the duration of the run, i.e. evap-
oration does not dominate new cloud production. While the
generation of turbulence prevents an orderly cyclic solution,
the behavior is qualitatively the same as in 1D. There are
substantial quantitative diﬀerences: the average density of
the cold gas never exceeds its maximum at t ≈ 20 tth and
the radiation force is correspondingly weaker; hence, the ve-
locities are greatly reduced. Importantly, however, the ratio
of the net accelerations for runs VF2D and CF2D is approx-
imately the same as that for runs VF1D and CF1D — a
factor of 2.4. This implies that the eﬀect of a variable ﬂux
is quite robust.

The right panels in Figure 4 show density maps of run
VF2D for ﬁve consecutive, quarter-cycle ﬂux states (denoted
A-F in the sine-wave sketch), while the left panels are the
corresponding density maps for run CF2D. During both of
the minimum ﬂux states (panels B and F), the density is
noticeably increased, as hydrodynamic eﬀects akin to those
depicted in Figure 2 are taking place. Velocity arrows are

1D, where a cyclic solution was found. During every low
ﬂux state, the gas cools, allowing additional lines to appear
that more strongly couples the gas to the radiation ﬁeld and
further accelerates the cloud via line driving.

Crucially, gas pressure eﬀects are very important in me-
diating the transition between ﬂux states, thereby permit-
ting the density to respond to the changes in temperature.
Simply lowering the ﬂux to its minimum value and then
holding it ﬁxed does not lead to an increase in acceleration;
an explicit calculation revealed that in both 1D and 2D the
ﬁnal velocities were actually 4% smaller than those for runs
CF1D and CF2D. In other words, a time-varying ﬂux leads
to a gas pressure dominated, time-dependent solution that
is qualitatively diﬀerent from a constant ﬂux solution.

This ﬁnding may have interesting observational con-
sequences and important implications for photoionization
modeling eﬀorts. For example, the responsivity of the BLR
gas (Krolik et al. 1991; Peterson 1993) is a central quantity
in reverberation mapping (RM) and transfer functions have
been shown to be sensitive to how this quantity scales with
radius (Goad et al. 1993). A negative responsivity, i.e. a de-
crease in line emission in response to an increase in the con-
tinuum ﬂux, is readily interpreted as emission from optically
thin clouds (Sparke 1993) and has been seen in X-ray RM
observations (McHardy et al. 2007; Fabian et al. 2009). Pho-
toionization models have diﬃculty accounting for this eﬀect
and simultaneously reproducing the observed line strengths
(Shields et al. 1995; see also Snedden & Gaskell 2007). The
hydrodynamic eﬀects associated with our present solutions
— signiﬁcant decreases in density accompanying high ﬂux
states — would naturally be expected to give rise to a nega-
tive responsivity, although they would complicate the anal-
ysis of time-delays in RM as they are a nonlinear response
(e.g., Skielboe et al. 2015). To resolve the issue with line
strengths, photoionization models may need to incorporate
results from time-dependent hydrodynamics.

Our 2D simulations suggest that the long-term evolu-
tion of a two-phase medium in the BLR is a highly turbulent
ﬂow that is conducive to continuous cloud production. The
chaotic state is a consequence of vorticity generation, as nei-
ther of the two requirements to conserve vorticity (namely,
that the radiation force be derivable from a potential and
that the ﬂow be barotropic) are close to being met. Once
disrupted cloud fragments become small enough that their
dimensions approach the length scale for conduction, i.e. the
Field length λF (Begelman & McKee 1990), they will be sub-
ject to evaporation on a thermal timescale (Cowie & McKee
1977). This can be seen taking place in Figure 4, yet we ﬁnd
that cloud production can be maintained because the tur-
bulence supplies perturbations that continually trigger the
thermal instability. However, can this turbulent ﬂow regime
permit clouds to be accelerated to the velocities inferred
from broad emission lines?

We can address this question if our simulations are rep-
resentative of the local dynamics in a global simulation,
which should be the case for length scales over which the ﬂux
does not falloﬀ substantially, say by more than 10%. This
acceleration zone is ∆r ≈ 0.05 r0, where r0 is the distance
where the cloud is formed. For a 108 M(cid:12) black hole and lu-

minosity LX = 0.1 LEdd, we have r0 =(cid:112)LX /4πFX = 44 ld.

velocity ﬁeld; they reveal the pronounced vortical motions of
the clouds, indicative of the large amount of vorticity in the
ﬂow. The mass-weighted mean velocity, (cid:104)vx(cid:105) (in km s−1),
is displayed on the corner of each panel in order to judge
the net acceleration. The main noticeable eﬀect is that dur-
ing the low ﬂux states, there are large increases in velocity
compared to run CF2D.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

As part of our ongoing eﬀort to understand the dynamics
of BLR clouds from ﬁrst principles, we have investigated
the dynamical response of a two-phase medium to a time-
varying ﬂux. Our main result is that small ﬂux oscillations
(∆FX = 20%) can lead to large changes in the net accel-
eration (240%), even in 2D where the ﬂow becomes highly
turbulent. The physics of this process is cleanly revealed in

the average acceleration of run VF2D, (cid:104)a(cid:105) = 6.5 cm s−2. (We
neglected gravity, as its acceleration is only −1.0 cm s−2 at
r0.) This highly supersonic speed is reached in about 500
days, which may further complicate RM predictions (e.g.,
Waters et al. 2016), since it implies dynamical changes on
timescales comparable to the duration of observational cam-
paigns. Nevertheless, it appears we are close to having a
comprehensive theory of cloud formation and acceleration
that can account for the high velocity BLR gas.
