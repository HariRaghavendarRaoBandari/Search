Ice-water, water-vapor interfaces and ice surface are studied by molecular dynamics simulations with the SPC/E
model of water molecules having the purpose to estimate the proﬁles of electrostatic potential across the in-
terfaces. We have proposed a methodology for calculating the proﬁles of electrostatic potential based on a
trial particle, which showed good agreement for the case of electrostatic potential proﬁle of the water-vapor
interface of TIP4P model calculated in another way. The measured proﬁle of electrostatic potential for the pure
ice-water interface decreases towards the liquid bulk region, which is in agreement with simulations of prefer-
ential direction of motion of Li+ and F− solute ions at the liquid side of the ice-water interface. These results
are discussed in connection with the Workman-Reynolds effect.

1. Introduction

Fundamental presence of water, ice and their ice-water, ice-vapor(air) and water-vapor(air) inter-
faces in nature deﬁnes huge interest to exploration of their structural and dynamic properties [1, 2].
Microscopic structure and dynamics of the interfaces can be studied by atomistic molecular dynamics
(MD) computer simulations using either models of water molecules with effective interactions or on ab
initio level with explicit account for electron subsystem. Among the different ice and water interfaces, the
ice-water interface has been studied much less, although by the date the issues of stability of the water-ice
interface [3–5], its width [6–9] and interfacial free energy [10–13] are quite well elaborated.

Not only the pure interfaces are of great interest — even more interesting and fascinating problem
is the behavior of different molecular and atomic solutes in the interfacial regions. One can mention a
problem of the effect of solutes on the surface tension of aqueous solutions [14, 15], a problem of ionic
transfer across aqueous and ice interfaces [16–19], the effects of salt on premelting the surface layers
of ice [20–22], and the Workman-Reynolds effect [23–29] observed during the freezing of dilute aqueous
solutions. The Workman-Reynolds effect of the emergence of freezing potential between the solid and
liquid phases is connected with a charge separation occuring at a growing ice surface (moving ice-water
interface). For simple aqueous solutions of NaCl, NaF, NaI, LiCl, etc., the Workman-Reynolds experiments
gave evidence of positive potential of liquid with respect to ice, i.e., the charge separation with an excess
of positive ions on the liquid side of the ice-aqueous solution interface. By date it is not clear what causes
the observed charge separation at the ice-water interface.

Computer simulations support the observations of the charge separation occuring in Workman-Rey-
nolds effect. Following a molecular dynamics study of the tendencies in ionic solute motion close to the

water/dichloroethane interface [30], one may use the same methodology and place positive/negative ions
on the liquid side of the ice-water interface. Upon proper equilibration, one can observe the preferable
direction of motion of the ions towards/outwards the interface. Such a study with Na+ and Cl− solute
ions at the liquid side of ice-water interface was reported in [10]. The positive sodium ions were mov-
ing towards the bulk water region of the two-phase system, while the negative Cl− ions were trying to
penetrate deeper into the interface heading towards the ice bulk region. These results for behaviour of
positive/negative ions at the ice-water interface imply that the preferential direction of motion of solute
ions can be caused by a difference in electrostatic potential between the solid and liquid sides of the pure
interface. Therefore, the aim of this study was to check if the same effect is observed for the ions at the
ice-water interface other than those reported in [10], and to estimate the proﬁles of electrostatic poten-
tial across three different interfaces: the water-vapor, ice-vapor and ice-water ones — and then compare
them. The proﬁle of electrostatic potential has already been calculated for water-vapor interface [31, 32],
while for ice surface there are experimental estimates of the surface potential, as well as there were re-
ported the proﬁles of the potential of the mean force for positive/negative ions [10, 22]. The rest of the
paper is organized as follows: in the next section we supply the details of our molecular dynamics simula-
tions as well as the methodology of calculations of the proﬁle of electrostatic potential will be explained.
In section 3, we report the results for the proﬁles of electrostatic potential for the water-vapor, ice-vapor
and ice-water interfaces and discuss our ﬁndings. The last section contains a conclusion of this study.

2. Methodology of calculations

Molecular dynamic simulations for the three two-phase systems (containing water-vapor, ice-vapor
and ice-water interfaces) were performed with the rigid SPC/E model [33] of water molecules. The sim-
ulated model ice-water system consisted of 2304 water molecules, ice-vapor and water-vapor systems —
each of 1344 molecules. The average temperature in simulations of ice-water and ice-vapor systems was
225 K, i.e., nearly at the melting point for ice of the SPC/E model [4, 34], and for the water-vapor system
the temperature was 298 K. For the case of ice-water and ice-vapor interfaces, we studied only the basal
face of the interfaces, although the other orientations of ice Ih form ice-water interfaces with a bit smaller
10–90 widths than the basal face (see [9]), however, this should not change the general tendency of the
behavior of ions at the inerface. Calculations of electrostatic proﬁles for the prism, (20¯21) and (2¯1¯10)
interfaces will be reported elsewhere.

The preparation of the interfaces for simulations at ambient pressure was described in detail in [10].
We used the same sequence of (N P T ), (N Pz AT ) and (N V T ) ensembles in order to ﬁrst prepare the bulk
ice and the bulk water systems at the same ambient pressure, and then to bring water and ice into contact
having the same area A and equilibrate the two-phase system by ﬂuctuating only the z-box length at z-
component of pressure tensor ﬁxed to 1 bar. The size of equilibrated ice-water system of 2304 SPC/E
water molecules was 26.8253 Å × 30.9903 Å × 85.3827 Å. The ultimate production runs of simulations
with the purpose of calculating the electrostatic potentials were performed in N V T ensemble with Nose-
Hoover thermostats. The electrostatics in simulations was treated by 3D Ewald method in all three cases
of different interfaces. The cut-off distance for short-range part of potentials was 10 Å. All the simulations
were performed by DL_POLY package [35].

We also performed ∼ 1.1−1.2 nanosecond-long simulations of the behaviour of single Li+ and F− ions
on the liquid side of the basal face of ice-water interface at T = 225 K. For ion interaction with the oxygens
of SPC/E water molecules we used the following parameters for short-range Lennard-Jones potential:
εLiO = 0.160026 kcal/mol, σLiO = 2.337 Å and εFO = 0.167144 kcal/mol, σFO = 3.143 Å. The ions at initial
positions were slowly grown in at a ﬁxed z-position ﬁrst as a neutral particle with an increasing size
every 500 timesteps (up to the mentioned Lennard-Jones parameter σLiO), and then gradually increasing
its charge by ±0.1 every 500 steps [10]. This procedure allowed us to grow in the solute ions without any
structural damages for the ice-water interface.

Calculations of the electrostatic potential across the simulated two-phase system can be performed
by means of the estimated charge-density proﬁles using their Fourier-transforms to solve the Poisson
equation. For the case of ice-water and ice-vapor interfaces, the charge-density proﬁles contain positive
and negative sharp peaks [9] in the solid phase which makes a direct application of the standard fast

13607-2

Proﬁles of eletrostatic potential

Fourier-transform programs problematic. In fact, sharp peaks in the charge-density proﬁles come from
the locations of the effective charges of oxygens and hydrogens in the atomic planes. However, the solute
ions never reach the locations of these point charges on oxygens and hydrogens. Therefore, we used a
simple methodology which is based on a trial neutral particle which moves in a plane with constrained z-
coordinate and the single-particle electrostatic energy is calculated every few steps at the position of the
trial particle (as if it had a charge +1). The trial particle interacts via soft-core potential ∼ (σ/r )12 with the
oxygens and hydrogens and, therefore, it practically moves freely in the atomic plane with constrained
z avoiding only the locations of the point charges on oxygens and hydrogens due to soft-core repulsion.
In that case (having in mind that we can apply the Ewald methodology to calculate the single-particle
electrostatic energy as if the trial particle had the charge +1) the electrostatic potential V (z) is simply the
average of single-particle electrostatic (Ewald) energies over conﬁgurations with the same z-coordinate
of the trial particle minus the Ewald self-interaction. Note, that in order to avoid a shift of the interfaces
in a system with a constrained particle, the motion of the simulation cell is constrained by removing the
z-component of the velocity at every step during the molecular dynamics simulations, similarly as it was
proposed in [36, 37] and was used earlier in our simulations reported in [10].

The z-coordinate of trial particle was changing with a step of 0.5 Å. In order to grow in the trial
particle at a new z-position, we slowly increased the effective parameter σ every 500 time steps. After
several thousand steps, the trial particle was grown in at a new z-position practically without any effect
on the structure of the interface.

3. Results and discussion

Although it is known that the solute ions are expelled from the ice bulk phase, and free energy calcula-
tions [38, 39] and MD simulations [40] support this fact, the observations for the direction of preferential
motion of positive/negative ions at the ice-water interface can shed light on the Workman-Reynolds ef-
fect [23]. We observed in MD simulations of the stable ice-water interface (the mass-density proﬁle for
the equilibrium relaxed basal face of ice Ih in contact with water simulated with the SPC/E model [33]
at T = 225 K is shown in ﬁgure 1) the same tendencies in the preferential direction of motion for simple
Li+ and F− ions (see ﬁgure 2) as were observed earlier for the larger in size Na+ and Cl− solute ions at
the liquid side of ice-water interface [10]. It is seen from ﬁgure 2, that the negative F− ion moves on the
liquid side of the ice-water interface and is heading towars the bulk ice region, while the positive Li+ ion
shows a very similar behaviour with the Na+ [10] having short-time trapping in cages on the liquid side
of the interface, although with the long-time tendency of motion towards the water bulk region.

Before calculating the proﬁle of electrostatic potential across the ice-water interface we tested our
methodology on a simpler case of SPC/E water-vapor interface. In ﬁgure 3 we show the results for the
density and electrostatic potential proﬁle across the water-vapor interface. The interface is located be-

tween z ≈ 16 Å and z ≈ 23 Å, and namely in this region one observes a strong drop of the electrostatic po-
tential, which shows a minimum nearly at the liquid side of the interface. In the literature there were re-
ported calculations of the electrostatic potentials for the water-vapor interface of TIP4P water molecules
[31, 32] and very similar (to our case of SPC/E model) proﬁle of electrostatic potential was obtained. The
minimum in proﬁle of electrostatic potential was observed at the distance ∼ 2.5 Å in the interface with
respect to the Gibbs dividing plane, and the drop of potential between the vapor and minimum in the
electrostatic potential in [32] was ∼ −0.4 eV. In our case of the SPC/E water-vapor interface, we observed
a minimum in the obtained proﬁle of the electrostatatic potential also approximately at a distance 3 Å
from the Gibbs dividing surface of the water-vapor density proﬁle, and the drop in electrostatic potential
was ∼ 8.68 kcal/mol (ﬁgure 3), which corresponds to −376.4 meV, and is in good agreement for the esti-
mate for TIP4P model [31], keeping in mind that the two water models (SPC/E and TIP4P) result in slightly
different values of dielectric permittivity. Hence, our proposed methodology of estimation of the proﬁle
of electrostatic potential for the case of water-vapor interface gives a very reasonable agreement with
the calculations by other methodology.

For the case of the pure ice surface, we used the same methodology of calculation of the proﬁle of
electrostatic potential. The obtained density proﬁle and electrostatic potential are shown in ﬁgure 4.
Qualitatively, the proﬁle of eletrostatic potential for the ice surface is similar to the water-vapor interface,
although the surface potential is smaller than for the water-vapor interface and is ∼ 5.63 kcal/mol. There
is a well-pronounced minimum in the electrostatic potential located in the top smeared-out atomistic

layer which actually corresponds to the liquid-like layer on the ice surface. The MD simulations of the
solute ions at the ice surface [22] gave evidence of localization of the positive solute ions in the liquid-
like layer, while the negative ions were trying to penetrate deeper in the interface creating more defects
and practically destroying the remaining order in the top surface layers. In the literature, there is not
much information on the surface potential of pure ice surface. We were able to ﬁnd some experimental
estimates for the pure ice surface potential from measurements with gold electrodes at temperatures
between 0◦C and −15◦C [25]. The ice surface potential with respect to gold electrode was reported to be
in the range ∼ 185 − 195 meV, which, however, upon riming changed the sign and became ∼ −215 meV.
Our MD calculations for the pure ice surface potential (with an existing liquid-like layer) give the value
of ∼ −244 meV. It is obvious that the presence of the liquid-like layer on the surface of ice at melting
temperature (at which the MD simulations were performed) should give a comparable value and the
same sign of the surface potential as were obtained for the water-vapor interface.

Figure 5 reports the proﬁle of electrostatic potential, that corresponds to the ice-water interface with
the mass-density proﬁle shown in ﬁgure 1. Our calculations show an increase of the electrostatic potential
from the water to the ice phase with approximately 2.1 kcal/mol (∼ 91 meV) net difference. This is in
agreement with our observations of the tendencies of the preferential motion of the positive solute ion
towards liquid phase and of the negative ion towards the bulk ice. Note that the ice-water interface has
the smallest change in the proﬁle of electrostatic potential in comparison with the water-vapor interface
and ice surface. It is obvious that in the crystal bulk region the proﬁle of electrostatic potential should

have the periodicity of the charge-density proﬁle. We did not extend our calculations into the ice bulk
region for the ice-water and ice-vapor interfaces. In order to recover the periodicity of the electrostatic
potential in ice bulk region one has to use in our methodology much smaller step in constrained z-position
for the trial particle.

4. Conclusions

In MD simulations of Li+ and F− ions at the ice-water interface we have observed different tendencies
in the preferential direction of motion which were the same as in the earlier reported behavior of larger
in size ions Na+ and Cl− in MD simulations [10]. In both cases, the positive ions had a preferential direc-
tion of motion towards the bulk water region, while the negative ions showed an opposite direction and
were trying to penetrate deeper in the interface. These observations are in agreement with the Workman-
Reynolds effect of emerging freezing potential at the growing ice in the aqueous solutions, which reﬂects
the charge separation with the excess of positive ions in the liquid phase.

In order to get insight into electrostatic effects which occur at different interfaces, we calculated from
MD simulations the proﬁles of electrostatic potential for the pure ice-water, water-vapor interfaces and
pure ice surface. We have proposed a new methodology of calculating the proﬁles of electrostatic po-
tentials by making use of a trial particle which moves in a plane with a ﬁxed z-coordinate and due to
soft-core repulsion avoids the positions of point charges. Calculations of a single-particle electrostatic en-
ergy by Ewald method at the instantaneous position of the trial particle is connected with the electrostatic
potential at this point, which after the average over different conﬁgurations results in the proﬁle of elec-
trostatic potential. Our check performed for the water-vapor interface showed good agreement with the
proﬁle of electrostatic potential for the water-vapor interface simulated with TIP4P model [31].

Our results indicate that among the three interfaces, the pure water-vapor interface has the largest
decrease of the proﬁle of electrostatic potential in the liquid phase, while the ice-water interface has
the smallest difference. The obtained proﬁle of electrostatic potential for the pure ice-water interface
decreases towards the bulk water region which can explain the observed difference in the preferential
direction of motion of the positive/negative solute ions observed in MD simulations.

Границi роздiлу лiд-вода, вода-пара та поверхня льоду були дослiдженi комп’ютерним моделюванням
методом молекулярної динамiки з SPC/E моделлю молекул води маючи на метi визначити профiлi еле-
ктростатичного потенцiалу через границi роздiлу фаз. Ми запропонували методологiю для розрахунку
профiлiв електростатичного потенцiалу з використанням пробної частинки. Запропонований пiдхiд по-
казав добре узгодження з профiлем електростатичного потенцiалу для границi роздiлу вода-пара в моде-
лi води, розрахованого iншою методикою. Отриманий профiль електростатичного потенцiалу для чистої
границi роздiлу лiд-вода зменшується в сторону рiдкої фази, що узгоджується з моделюванням переважа-
ючого напрямку руху домiшкових iонiв Li+ та F− на рiдиннiй сторонi границi роздiлу лiд-вода. Отриманi
результати обговорюються з точки зору їх вiдношення до ефекту Воркмана-Рейнольдса.
