THE BI-COMPACT-OPEN TOPOLOGY ON C(X)

ANUBHA JINDAL, R. A. MCCOY, AND S. KUNDU

Abstract. For the set C(X) of real-valued continuous functions on a Tychonoﬀ space
X, the compact-open topology on C(X) is a “set-open topology.” This paper studies the
separation and countability properties of the space C(X) having the topology given by
the join of the compact-open topology and an “open-set topology” called the open-point
topology, that was introduced in [6].

1. Introduction

The set C(X) of all real-valued continuous functions on a Tychonoﬀ space X has a number
of natural topologies. One important type of topology on C(X) is the set-open topology,
introduced by Arens and Dugunji [1], and later studied particularly in [8], [10], [11], [12] and
[13]. In the deﬁnition of a set-open topology on C(X), we use a certain family of subsets
of X and open subsets of R. In [6], by adopting a radically diﬀerent approach, we have
deﬁned two new kinds of topologies on C(X) known as the open-point and bi-point-open
topologies. One main reason for adopting such a diﬀerent approach is to ensure that both
X and R play equally signiﬁcant roles in the construction of topologies on C(X). This gives
a function space where one has more control of the functions in it.

The open-point topology on C(X) has a subbase consisting of sets of the form

[U, r]− = {f ∈ C(X) : f −1(r) ∩ U 6= ∅},

where U is an open subset of X and r ∈ R. The open-point topology on C(X) is denoted
by h and the space C(X) equipped with the open-point topology h is denoted by Ch(X).
The term “h” comes from the word “horizontal” because, for example, a subbasic open set
in Ch(R) can be viewed as the set of functions in C(R) whose graphs pass through some
given horizontal open segment in R × R, as opposed to a subbasic open set in Cp(R) which
consists of the set of functions in C(R) whose graphs pass through some given vertical open
segment in R × R.

Among the set-open topologies on C(X), the compact open topology k occupies an emi-
nent place. This topology, since its introduction in 1945 by Fox in [3], has been extensively
studied by many people from the view point of topology as well as from the view point of
its dual used in analysis. This motivates one to study the open-compact topology on C(X),
that is, the topology consisting of subbasic open sets of the form

[U, B]− = {f ∈ C(X) : f −1(B) ∩ U 6= ∅},

where U is an open subset of X and B is compact set in R. But one can prove that both
the collections

{[U, r]− : U is open in X and r ∈ R}

and

{[U, B]− : U is open in X and B is compact in R}

generate the same topology on C(X), and that is the open-point topology “h”.

As we have deﬁned in [6], the bi-point-open topology on C(X) is the join of the point-
open topology p and the open-point topology h. In other words, it is the topology having
[x, V ]+ = {f ∈ C(X) : f (x) ∈ V } and [U, r]−, where
subbasic open sets of both kinds:
x ∈ X and V is an open subset of R, while U is an open subset of X and r ∈ R. The
bi-point-open topology on the space C(X) is denoted by ph and the space C(X) equipped
with the bi-point-open topology ph is denoted by Cph(X). One can also view the bi-point-
open topology on C(X) as the weak topology on C(X) generated by the identity maps
id1 : C(X) → Cp(X) and id2 : C(X) → Ch(X).

Similarly, we can deﬁne the bi-compact-open topology on C(X) as the join of the compact-
open topology k and the open-point topology h. In other words, it is the topology having
subbasic open sets of both kinds: [A, V ]+ = {f ∈ C(X) : f (A) ⊆ V } and [U, r]−, where A
is a compact subset of X and V is open in R, while U is an open subset of X and r ∈ R.
The bi-compact-open topology on C(X) is denoted by kh and the space C(X) equipped
with the bi-compact-open topology kh is denoted by Ckh(X). One can also view the bi-
compact-open topology on C(X) as the weak topology on C(X) generated by the identity
maps id1 : C(X) → Ck(X) and id2 : C(X) → Ch(X).

In [6] and [7], we have shown that the space, Cph(X) has some nice properties. For
example, the pseudocharacter of Cph(X) is equal to the density of X; that is, ψ(Cph(X)) =
d(X). But most of the properties of the spaces Ch(X) and Cph(X) come under strong
restriction on X. For example, the space Cph(X) is Tychonoﬀ if and only if the set of
isolated points in X is Gδ-dense. The properties of the space Ckh(X) seem to be less
restricted than the same properties of the spaces Ch(X) and Cph(X). So in the authors’
opinion, Ckh(X) is more interesting and tends to have stronger topological properties.

In Section 2, we give some bases and study the separation properties of the space Ckh(X).
It is shown that the space Ckh(X) is completely regular if and only if the set of locally com-
pact points in X is Gδ-dense in X. In Section 3, the submetrizability and ﬁrst countability
of the space Ckh(X) are characterized. In the last section, we discuss the separability of the
space Ckh(X).

Throughout this paper the following conventions are used. The symbols R, Q, Z and
N denote the space of real numbers, rational numbers, integers and natural numbers, re-
spectively. For a space X the symbol X 0 denotes the set of all isolated points in X, |X|
denotes the cardinality of the space X, A denotes the closure of A in X, Ac denotes the
complement of A in X and 0X denotes the constant zero-function in C(X). Also for any
two topological spaces X and Y that have the same underlying set, the three expressions
X = Y , X ≤ Y and X < Y mean that, respectively, the topology of X is same as topology
of Y , the topology of X is weaker than or equal to topology of Y and the topology of X is
strictly weaker than the topology of Y . For other basic topological notions, refer to [2].

In this section, we study the separation axioms of the space Ckh(X). We ﬁrst give some
bases for the space Ckh(X) that are useful in establishing properties for this space. Here U

is some given base for X and V is some given countable base for R consisting of bounded
open intervals. Now Proposition 2.1 in [6] implies the following proposition.

Proposition 2.1. The space Ckh(X) has a base consisting of sets of the form [A1, V1]+ ∩
. . . ∩ [Am, Vm]+ ∩ [U1, r1]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Un, rn]−, where m, n ∈ N, Ai is a compact subset of X,
Vi ∈ V, Uj ∈ U, rj ∈ R, whenever 1 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ j ≤ n, and Ui ∩ Uj = ∅ for i 6= j.

Proposition 2.2. The space Ckh(X) has a π-base of sets of the form [A1, W1]+ ∩ . . . ∩
[Am, Wm]+ ∩[U1, r1]− ∩. . .∩[Un, rn]−, where m, n ∈ N, Ai is a compact subset of X, Wi ∈ V,
Uj ∈ U, rj ∈ R, whenever 1 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ j ≤ n; and for each j = 1, . . . , n, either
Uj ∩ Ai = ∅ for all i = 1, . . . , m, or Uj ⊆ ∪{Ai : rj ∈ Wi} and Uj ∩ ∪{Ai : rj /∈ Wi} = ∅,
and Ui ∩ Uj = ∅ for i 6= j.

Proof. Let B = [A1, W1]+∩. . .∩[Am, Wm]+∩[U1, r1]−∩. . .∩[Un, rn]− be any nonempty basic
open set in Ckh(X), where Ai is a compact subset in X and Wi ∈ V for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m};
and Uj is an open set in X and rj ∈ R for each j ∈ {1, . . . , n}; and Ui ∩ Uj = ∅ for
i 6= j. So for f ∈ B, there exists xj ∈ Uj such that f (xj ) = rj for each j ∈ {1, . . . , n}
and f (Ai) ⊆ Wi for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}. Now for each j = 1, . . . , n, we have either
Uj ⊆ A1 ∪ . . . ∪ Am or Uj \ (A1 ∪ . . . ∪ Am) 6= ∅. Without loss of generality, we can assume
that Uj ⊆ A1 ∪ . . . ∪ Am for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, where k ≤ n and Uj \ (A1 ∪ . . . ∪ Am) 6= ∅ for
j = Uj \ ∪{Ai : rj /∈ Wi} is a nonempty open

For k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n, let yj ∈ Uj \ (A1 ∪ . . . ∪ Am) = U

{yk+1, . . . , yn} is a collection of distinct points in X. Now deﬁne g ∈ C(X) such that
g(x) = f (x) for each x ∈ A1 ∪ . . . ∪ Am and g(yj) = rj for k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Then

The space Ckh(X) has ﬁner topology than the Hausdorﬀ space Ck(X), so that Ckh(X)
is always a Hausdorﬀ space. However, Ckh(X) need not be completely regular. The next
theorem characterizes those spaces X for which Ckh(X) is completely regular. For this
theorem we need two lemmas, the ﬁrst of which concerns the set of points of a space X that
have compact neighborhoods. Let us call such a point a locally compact point of X, and
let lc(X) denote the set of such points. Also recall that a subset A of a space X is called
Gδ-dense in X if every nonempty Gδ-set in X intersects A.

Lemma 2.3. If lc(X) is Gδ-dense in X, then Ch(X) has a base consisting of sets of the
form [U1, r1]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Un, rn]−, where each open set Ui has compact closure and Ui ∩ Uj = ∅
for i 6= j.

Proof. Let G = [V1, r1]− ∩. . .∩[Vn, rn]− be any nonempty basic open set in Ch(X), where Vi
is open in X, ri is in R and Vi ∩ Vj = ∅ for each i 6= j. If f ∈ G, then for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n},
we have f −1(ri) ∩ Vi 6= ∅. Since lc(X) is Gδ-dense in X, for each i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, there
exist xi in lc(X) and an open set Ui having compact closure such that xi ∈ f −1(ri) ∩ Vi
and xi ∈ Ui ⊆ Ui ⊆ Vi. Since Vi ∩ Vj = ∅ for i 6= j, Ui ∩ Uj = ∅ for i 6= j. Hence
f ∈ [U1, r1]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Un, rn]− ⊆ G.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.4. If A is a nonempty Gδ-set in X, then there exists f ∈ C(X) such that f ≥ 0,
f −1(0) 6= ∅ and f −1(0) ⊆ A.

Proof. See 3.11.(b) in [4].

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.5. For any space X, the following are equivalent.

(a) Ckh(X) is completely regular.
(b) Ckh(X) is regular.
(c) lc(X) is Gδ-dense in X.

Proof. (a) ⇒ (b). Every completely regular space is regular.
(b) ⇒ (c). Suppose that lc(X) is not Gδ-dense in X. So there exists a nonempty Gδ-set A in
X such that lc(X) ∩ A = ∅. By Lemma 2.4 there exists f ∈ C(X) such that ∅ 6= f −1(0) ⊆ A
and f ≥ 0. As lc(X) ∩ A = ∅, the set f −1(0) contains no locally compact point. Since
f −1(0) ∩ A 6= ∅, F = Ckh(X) \ [X, 0]− is a closed subset of Ckh(X) which does not contain
f . Let B = [A1, V1]+ ∩ . . . ∩ [Am, Vm]+ ∩ [U1, r1]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Un, rn]− be any basic open set
and W be any open set in Ckh(X) such that f ∈ B and F ⊆ W , where Ui ∩ Uj = ∅ for
i 6= j. Since f ≥ 0 and f ∈ B, for each j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, there exists xj ∈ Uj such that
f (xj) = rj ≥ 0 . Let I = {i ∈ {1, . . . , n} : ri = 0} and J = {1, . . . , n} \ I. When i ∈ I, xi is
not a locally compact point of X. Now we show that W ∩ B 6= ∅, and thus Ckh(X) is not
regular.

Let ai = min f (Ai) for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. If ai = 0 for some i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, then 0 ∈ Vi. For
each such i, since Vi is open, there exists δi > 0 such that [0, δi) ⊆ Vi. Then take S = { δi
2 :
ai = 0} ∪ { ai
2 : j ∈ J} and ǫ = min{s : s ∈ S}. Now deﬁne g : X → R by
g(x) = max{f (x), ǫ}. Clearly g ∈ C(X) such that g > 0, g ∈ [A1, V1]+ ∩ . . . ∩ [Am, Vm]+
and g(xj ) = rj for each j ∈ J. Hence g ∈ F ⊆ W .

continuously on X. Then h ∈ B ∩ B′ ⊆ B ∩ W .
(c) ⇒ (a).
It is enough to prove the result for subbasic open sets as the maximum or
minimum of a ﬁnite number of continuous functions is continuous. So let [U, r]− be a
subbasic open set in Ckh(X) such that U is a compact subset of X and f ∈ [U, r]−. Let
x ∈ f −1(r) ∩ U . Since X is a completely regular space, there exists a continuous function
φ : X → [0, 1] such that φ(x) = 0 and φ(y) = 1 for y /∈ U . For each g ∈ Ckh(X), deﬁne

Clearly, Φ(f ) = 0 and Φ(g) = 1 for g /∈ [U, r]−. Now we show that the function Φ :
Ckh(X) → [0, 1] is continuous.

Let g ∈ Ckh(X), let t = Φ(g) and let ǫ > 0. Suppose ﬁrst that g−1(r) ∩ U 6= ∅ and
In this case, we can assume that t − ǫ > 0. Since U is compact, the set
that t > 0.
G = [U ∩ φ−1(t − ǫ
2 ]), {r}c]+ is an open set in Ckh(X). Now
we show that g ∈ G and Φ(G) ⊆ (t−ǫ, t+ǫ). Since Φ(g) = t, there exists y ∈ g−1(r)∩U such

that t ≤ φ(y) < t+ ǫ
So, we have g−1(r) ∩ U ∩ φ−1[0, t − ǫ] = ∅. Thus g ∈ G. For each h ∈ G, there exists y ∈ U
such that h(y) = r and φ(y) ∈ (t − ǫ

On the other hand, if g−1(r) ∩ U = ∅, then Φ(g) = 1. Choose any 0 < ǫ < 1. Consider
the neighborhood (1 − ǫ, 1] of Φ(g). Take B = [U ∩ φ−1[0, 1 − ǫ
2 ], {r}c]+. Now we prove
that g ∈ B and Φ(B) ⊆ (1 − ǫ, 1]. Since for y ∈ U \ U , φ(y) = 1 and g−1(r) ∩ U = ∅, we
have U ∩ g−1(r) ∩ φ−1[0, 1 − ǫ
2 ] = ∅. Thus g ∈ B. Note that if h ∈ B, then h(z) 6= r for all
z ∈ U ∩ φ−1[0, 1 − ǫ
2 ≤ inf φ(h−1(r) ∩ U ) ≤ 1. Then this implies
that Φ(B) ⊆ (1 − ǫ, 1]. So Φ is continuous.

Now let us consider a subbasic open set of the form [A, V ]+ in Ckh(X) and f ∈ [A, V ]+.
Since Ck(X) is a completely regular space, there exists a continuous function Ψ : Ckh(X) →
[0, 1] such that Ψ(f ) = 0 and Ψ(g) = 1 for g /∈ [A, V ]+. By using Lemma 2.3 and the
continuity of Φ and Ψ, one can prove that Ckh(X) is a completely regular space.
(cid:3)

Remark 1. In [6], it is shown that the space Cph(X) is completely regular if and only if X 0
is Gδ-dense in X if and only if Ch(X) is completely regular. Since X 0 ⊆ lc(X), complete
regularity of the space Cph(X) implies the complete regularity of the space Ckh(X). But
the converse need not be true. For example Theorem 2.5 implies that the space Ckh(R) is
completely regular, while the spaces Ch(R) and Cph(R) are not completely regular.

We end this section by examining when the spaces Cph(X) and Ckh(X) have the same
topology; that is, when Cph(X) = Ckh(X). If Cp(X) = Ck(X), then obviously Cph(X) =
Ckh(X). But if Cph(X) = Ckh(X), then it is not clear whether Cp(X) = Ck(X). In the
next theorem, we show that it is in fact true.

Theorem 2.6. For a space X, the following are equivalent.

(a) Cp(X) = Ck(X)
(b) Cph(X) = Ckh(X)
(c) Every compact subset of X is ﬁnite.

Proof. (a) ⇒ (b). It is immediate.
(b) ⇒ (c). Suppose that A is an inﬁnite compact subset of X. Let [A, V ]+ be an open set in
Ckh(X), where V is an open proper subset of R. Let f ∈ [A, V ]+. Since Cph(X) = Ckh(X),
there exists an open set B = [y1, V1]+ ∩ . . . ∩ [ym, Vm]+ ∩ [U1, r1]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Un, rn]− in
Cph(X) such that f ∈ B ⊆ [A, V ]+, where yi ∈ X and Vi is an open subset of R for each
i ∈ {1, . . . , m}; also Uj is an open subset of X and rj is an element of R for each j ∈
{1, 2, . . . , n}. Since f ∈ B, there exists xj ∈ Uj such that f (xj) = rj for each j ∈ {1, . . . , n}
and f (yi) ∈ Vi for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}.

Choose x0 ∈ A \ ({y1, . . . , ym} ∪ {x1, . . . , xn}) and r ∈ R \ V . Take S = {yi : 1 ≤ i ≤
m} ∪ {xj : 1 ≤ j ≤ n} ∪ {x0}. Since S is a compact subset of X, there exists g ∈ C(X) such
that g(x0) = r; and g(yi) ∈ Vi for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m} and g(xj) = rj for each j ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
Thus g ∈ B but g /∈ [A, V ]+.
(c) ⇒ (a). It is well-known.

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.7. For a space X, the space Ch(X) can never be weaker than the space Ck(X).

Proof. Now [U, 0]− is an open set in Ch(X) containing the constant zero-function 0X. Let
B = h0X , A, ǫi = {f ∈ C(X) : |f (x)| < ǫ for all x ∈ A} be any basic neighborhood of 0X in
Ck(X), where A is a compact subset of X and ǫ > 0. Take f ∈ C(X) such that f (x) = ǫ
2
for all x ∈ X. Then f ∈ B but f /∈ [U, 0]−. So [U, 0]− cannot be open in Ck(X).
(cid:3)

So the space Ck(X) is either strictly weaker than the space Ch(X) or there is no relation.
In our next theorem we show that the space Ck(X) is strictly weaker than Ch(X) if and
only if X is a discrete space.

Theorem 2.8. For a space X, the following are equivalent.

(a) Ck(X) < Ch(X).
(b) Ckh(X) = Ch(X).
(c) X is a discrete space.

Proof. (a) ⇒ (b). This follows from Ch(X) ≤ Ckh(X).
(b) ⇒ (c). Suppose that X is not discrete. Then X has some non-isolated point x0. Now
[x0, (−1, 1)]+ is an open neighborhood of the constant zero-function 0X in Ckh(X). To show
that [x0, (−1, 1)]+ is not a neighborhood of 0X in Ch(X) let

B = [U1, 0]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Un, 0]−

be any basic neighborhood of 0X in Ch(X). Since x0 is non-isolated, there exists xi ∈
Ui \ {x0} for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Let g ∈ C(X) be such that g(x0) = 1 and g(x) = 0 for all
x ∈ {x1, . . . , xn}. Then g ∈ B but g /∈ [x0, (−1, 1)]+. So [x0, (−1, 1)]+ cannot be open in
Ch(X).
(c) ⇒ (a). Suppose that X is discrete. Take any subbasic open set [A, V ]+ = {f ∈ C(X) :
f (A) ⊆ V } in Ck(X), where A is a compact set in X and V is an open set in R. Since X is
discrete, A is a ﬁnite set. So for any f ∈ [A, V ]+, ∩x∈A[x, f (x)]− is an open set in Ch(X)
containing f and ∩x∈A[x, f (x)]− ⊆ [A, V ]+. Hence [A, V ]+ is open in Ch(X).
(cid:3)

3. Submetrizability and first countability of Ckh(X)

In this section, we study the submetrizability and ﬁrst countability of the space Ckh(X).
A submetrizable space is one that admits a weaker metrizable topology, or equivalently, one
having a continuous injection mapping it into a metric space.

Remark 2.

(1) Every pseudocompact set in a submetrizable space is a Gδ-set.

In particular all
compact subsets, countably compact subsets and the singletons are Gδ-sets in a
submetrizable space.

(2) If a space X has a Gδ-diagonal, that is, if the set {(x, x) : x ∈ X} is a Gδ-set
in the product space X × X, then every point in X is a Gδ-set. Note that every
metrizable space has a Gδ-diagonal. Consequently every submetrizable space has a
Gδ-diagonal. For more details on submetrizable spaces, see [5].

Theorem 3.1. For a space X, the following are equivalent.

(a) Ckh(X) is submetrizable.
(b) Ckh(X) has a Gδ-diagonal.
(c) Each singleton set in C(X) is a Gδ-set in Ckh(X).
(d) {0X} is a Gδ-set in Ckh(X).
(e) X is almost σ-compact.
(f ) Ck(X) is submetrizable.

Proof. (a) ⇒ (b) ⇒ (c) and (e) ⇔ (f ). These are well known.
(c) ⇒ (d). It is immediate.
(d) ⇒ (e). Since 0X ∈ C(X) is a Gδ-set in Ckh(X), there exists a countable family γ =
{Wn : n ∈ N} of open sets in Ckh(X) such that {0X} = ∩γ. We can assume for each n ∈ N,
Wn is of the form [An1 , Vn1 ]+ ∩ . . . ∩ [Anmn , Vnmn ]+ ∩ [Un1, 0]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Untn , 0]−, where for
1 ≤ i ≤ mn, Ani is compact in X and Vni is open in R, and for 1 ≤ j ≤ tn, Unj is open in

Let A = ∪{Kn : n ∈ N}. Suppose that A 6= X. So there exists x0 ∈ X \ A. Since X is a
completely regular space, there exists f ∈ C(X) such that f (x0) = 1 and f (y) = 0, for all
y ∈ A. Therefore f ∈ Wn for each n ∈ N. So f = 0X , but f (x0) = 1. Therefore A is dense
in X. Hence X is almost σ-compact.
(f ) ⇒ (a). This follows from Ck(X) ≤ Ckh(X).

Our next theorem gives a necessary condition for the ﬁrst countability of the space

Ckh(X).

Theorem 3.2. If Ckh(X) has a countable local base at the constant zero-function 0X, then
X is hemicompact.

Proof. Let W = {Wn : n ∈ N} be a countable base at 0X in Ckh(X). We can assume that
for each n ∈ N, Wn = [An1 , Vn1 ]+ ∩ . . . ∩ [Ankn , Vnkn ]+ ∩ [Un1 , 0]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Untn , 0]−. Choose
xni ∈ Uni for 1 ≤ i ≤ tn and put Kn = ∪kn
j=1{xnj }. For each n ∈ N, Kn is
compact.

i=1Ani ∪ ∪tn

If K is any compact subspace of X, we wish to show that K ⊆ Kn for some n ∈ N. Now
W = [K, (−1, 1)]+ is an open set in Ckh(X) containing 0X . So there exists Wm ∈ W such
that Wm ⊆ W for some m ∈ N. Now we show that K ⊆ Km. Suppose that there exists
x ∈ K \ Km. Since X is Tychonoﬀ, there exists f ∈ C(X) such that f (x) = 1 and f (y) = 0
for all y ∈ Km. Then f /∈ W but f ∈ Wm. So our supposition is wrong. Thus K ⊆ Km
and hence X is hemicompact.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.3. If Ckh(X) is ﬁrst countable, then X is hemicompact.

Theorem 3.4. If X is a hemicompact metric space, then the constant zero-function 0X has
a countable base in Ckh(X).

Proof. Let (Kn) be a sequence of compact sets in X such that every compact set in X is
contained in Km for some m ∈ N. Let K = {Kn : n ∈ N}. Since X is a hemicompact metric
space, X is second countable. Let B be a countable base for X and V be a countable local
base at 0 ∈ R. Now consider the collection F of open sets in Ckh(X) containing 0X of the
form

[Kn1 , Vn1]+ ∩ . . . ∩ [Knk , Vnk ]+ ∩ [Un1 , 0]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Unt, 0]−,

where Ki ∈ K, Vi ∈ V and Uj ∈ B for each i ∈ {n1, . . . , nk} and j ∈ {n1, . . . , nt}. Clearly
F is a countable family. Now we show that F forms a base at 0X .

Let G = [A1, W1]+ ∩ . . . ∩ [Am, Wm]+ ∩ [U1, 0]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Un, 0]− be any basic open set in
Ckh(X) containing 0X, where Ai is a compact subset of X, Wi is open in R and Uj ∈ B,
0 ∈ R for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} and Uj ∩ Uk = ∅ for j 6= k. Since 0X ∈ G, for
each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, we have 0 ∈ Wi. Since X is hemicompact and V is a countable local
base at 0 ∈ R, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, there exist Kki ∈ K and Vki ∈ V such that Ai ⊆ Kki and
Vki ⊆ Wi. Clearly 0X ∈ [Kk1 , Vk1 ]+ ∩ . . . ∩ [Kkm, Vkm ]+ ∩ [U1, 0]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Un, 0]− ⊆ G. (cid:3)

Now Corollary 3.3 implies that X being hemicompact is a necessary condition for the ﬁrst
countability of the space Ckh(X). In our next theorem, we show that X being hemicompact
is also a suﬃcient condition for the ﬁrst countability of the space Ckh(X) whenever X is a
locally connected metric space.

Theorem 3.5. If X is a locally connected metric space, then the following are equivalent.

(a) X is a hemicompact space.
(b) Ckh(X) is ﬁrst countable.

Proof. (a) ⇒ (b). Since X is hemicompact, Ck(X) is ﬁrst countable. Now the proof follows
from Corollary 4.14 in [7].
(b) ⇒ (a). This follows from Corollary 3.3.

(cid:3)

By Corollary 3.3, hemicompactness of X is a necessary condition for the metrizability of
the space Ckh(X). Our next example shows that even for a locally connected metrizable
space X, hemicompactness of X is not a suﬃcient condition for the metrizability of Ckh(X).

Example 3.6. Let X be the space of real numbers with usual topology. Then by Theorem
4.3 of next section, we have Ckh(X) is separable. But Ckh(X) is not second countable for
any topological space X by Theorem 4.9 of the next section. So it cannot be metrizable.

4. separability of Ckh(X)

In this section, we discuss the separability of the space Ckh(X). For this we ﬁrst need to

study the R-sets and R-separable spaces.

A nonempty subset B of a space X is said to be an R-set if there exists a countable collec-

tion T = {fn : n ∈ N} of real-valued continuous functions on X such that Sn∈N fn(B) = R.

A space X is said to be R-separable if there exists a countable collection of R-sets in X
such that every nonempty open set in X contains some member of this collection.

It is easy to see that every R-set is uncountable and any set containing an R-set is an
R-set. Every R-separable space is separable and contains no isolated point. In order to show
that there exists a large class of R-separable spaces, we prove the following propositions.

Proposition 4.1. A perfect Polish space is R-separable.

Proof. Let X be a perfect Polish space and B = {Un : n ∈ N} be a countable base for X. It
is suﬃcient to prove that there is a countable collection S of R-sets such that every element
of B contains an element of S. By using the regularity of X, for each n ∈ N, if x ∈ Un there
exists Vn open in X such that x ∈ Vn ⊆ Vn ⊆ Un. As X is a perfect space and Vn is open
in X, this implies that Vn contains no isolated point. Then Vn is a perfect set in X (see
exercise 30B.3 of [14]). Since closed subset of a Polish space is a Polish space and every
perfect Polish space contains a Cantor set, Vn is a perfect Polish space and it contains a
Cantor set Sn. Next, we show that Sn is an R-set. Since R = ∪[−m, m] and every compact
metric space is a continuous image of a Cantor set, for each m ∈ N, there exists fm ∈ C(X)
such that fm(Sn) = [−m, m]. Thus ∪m∈Nfm(Sn) = R. Hence Sn is an R-set.
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.2. If X is a space having a countable π-base consisting of nontrivial con-
nected sets, then X is R-separable.

Proof. It is suﬃcient to prove that every nontrivial connected subset of X is an R-set. Let U
be a nontrivial connected subset of X, and let xU , yU be distinct elements of U . Since X is
a Tychonoﬀ space and U is a connected subset of X, for each n ∈ N, there exists fn ∈ C(X)
such that [−n, n] ⊆ fn(U ). Therefore ∪n∈Nfn(U ) = R, and hence U is an R-set.
(cid:3)

We have the following necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the separability of the space

Ckh(X).

Theorem 4.3. Let X be a space with a countable π-base. Then the following are equivalent.

(a) Ckh(X) is separable.

THE BI-COMPACT-OPEN TOPOLOGY ON C(X)

(b) Cph(X) is separable.
(c) X is an R-separable submetrizable space.

Proof. (a) ⇒ (b). It follows from the fact that Cph(X) ≤ Ckh(X).
(b) ⇒ (c). If Cph(X) is separable, then Cp(X) is separable. Therefore, Corollary 4.2.2 in [9]
implies that X is submetrizable. Now we show that every open set in X is an R-set. Let
T = {fn : n ∈ N} be a countable dense set in Cph(X) and U be any nonempty open set

in X. Suppose that there exists a y ∈ R \ Sn∈N fn(U ). Then [U, y]− is a nonempty open

set in Cph(X) which does not intersect with T . Thus U is an R-set in X. Since X has a
countable π-base, X is R-separable.
(c) ⇒ (a). Suppose that K = {Sn : n ∈ N} is a countable family of R-sets in X such
that every nonempty open subset of X contains some member of K. Let U be a countable
π-base for X and V be a countable base for R consisting of bounded open intervals. For
convenience of notation, for each n ∈ N, let ˆU n be the set of (U1, . . . , Un) ∈ U n such that
{U1, . . . , Un} is a collection of pairwise disjoint sets. Since X is a separable submetrizable
space, the space Ck(X) is separable. So let F be a countable dense subset of Ck(X).

for 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Since f is continuous and X is a Tychonoﬀ space, for each n ∈ N, T n
Then Tf = ∪n∈NT n

f = {((U1, . . . , Un), (V1, . . . , Vn)) ∈ ˆU n × V n : f (Ui) ⊆ Vi
f 6= ∅.

For each f ∈ F and n ∈ N, let T n

f is countable.

Let T ∈ Tf , say T = ((U1, . . . , Un), (V1, . . . , Vn)). Since X is an R-separable Tychonoﬀ
space, for each i = 1, . . . , n, there exist Ei ∈ U, Si ∈ K and a countable collection FSi
in C(X) such that Si ⊆ Ei ⊆ Ui, Ui \ Ei and Si are completely separated sets in X and
∪{g(Si) : g ∈ FSi } = R. For each i = 1, . . . , n, take Li = {f Si ∈ FSi : (f Si)−1(Vi) ∩ Si 6=
∅}; then for each f Si ∈ Li, there exists a continuous function f Si
: X → Vi such that
i
f Si
i (x) = f Si(x) for x ∈ (f Si)−1(Vi) ∩ Si and f Si
i (x) = f (x) for each x ∈ Ui \ Ei. Take
ST = {S1, . . . , Sn} and let HST = {(f S1
n ) : f Si ∈ Li, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Clearly HST is
1 , . . . , f Sn
countable.

Then for each T ∈ Tf and H ∈ HST , where

T = ((U1, . . . , Um), (V1, . . . , Vm)) and H = {f S1

deﬁne a continuous function fT,H : X → R as follows.

fT,H(x) = (cid:26) f Si

i (x)
f (x)

x ∈ Ui and 1 ≤ i ≤ m

x ∈ X \ Ui and 1 ≤ i ≤ m.

Consider F ′ to be the collection {fT,H : f ∈ F , T ∈ Tf , H ∈ HST }, which we now prove is
dense in Ckh(X).

Let G be any nonempty open set in Ckh(X), then Proposition 2.2 implies that G contains
a nonempty open set B = [A1, G1]+ ∩ . . . ∩ [Am, Gm]+ ∩ [U1, r1]− ∩ . . . ∩ [Un, rn]− such that
for each j = 1, . . . , n, either Uj ∩ Ai = ∅ for all i = 1, . . . , m, or Uj ⊆ ∪{Ai : rj ∈ Gi}
and Uj ∩ ∪{Ai
: rj /∈ Gi} = ∅; and Ai is a compact subset of X, Gi ∈ V whenever
i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, and Ui ∩ Uj = ∅ for i 6= j. Let f ∈ F ∩ [A1, G1]+ ∩ . . . ∩ [Am, Gm]+ and
let Ij = {1 ≤ i ≤ m : rj ∈ Gi, Uj ∩ Ai 6= ∅}. We can assume that Ij 6= ∅ and |Ij| = tj for
1 ≤ j ≤ k, where k ≤ n and Ij = ∅ for k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n.

If Ij 6= ∅, then for each i ∈ Ij, rj ∈ Gi and Uj ∩ Ai ∩ f −1(Gi) 6= ∅. Since X is a perfect
i ∈ f −1(Gi) ∩ Uj such that {xj

Since the sum function s : Ch(⊕{Xα : α ∈ Γ}) → Π{Ch(Xα) : α ∈ Γ} is a homeomor-

phism (see Proposition 2.11 of [7]), we have the following result.

Corollary 4.4. If X is the topological sum of c (where c = 2ℵ0) or fewer R-separable
metrizable spaces, then Ckh(X) is separable.

Corollary 4.5. If X is a locally connected separable metric space without isolated points,
then the space Ckh(X) is separable.

Corollary 4.6. If X is a perfect Polish space, then the space Ckh(X) is separable.

Example 4.7. Let X = P be the space of irrationals. Then Corollary 4.6 implies that the
space Ckh(X) is separable.

Example 4.8. Let X = S be the Sorgenfrey line. Then Theorem 4.3 implies that the space
Ckh(X) is separable.

Finally, the last theorem, whose proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 5.12 in [6],
points out that there are certain countability properties that the space Ckh(X) never has.

Theorem 4.9. The space Ckh(X) is neither Lindel¨of nor second countable.
