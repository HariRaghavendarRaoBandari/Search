ABSTRACT

We explore the predictions for detectable gravitational-wave signals from merging binary black holes
formed through chemically homogeneous evolution in massive short-period stellar binaries. We ﬁnd
that ∼ 500 events per year could be detected with advanced ground-based detectors operating at full
sensitivity. We analyze the distribution of detectable events, and conclude that there is a very strong
preference for detecting events with nearly equal components (mass ratio > 0.66 at 90% conﬁdence
in our default model) and high masses (total source-frame mass between 57 and 103 M(cid:12) at 90%
conﬁdence). We consider multiple alternative variations to analyze the sensitivity to uncertainties in
the evolutionary physics and cosmological parameters, and conclude that while the rates are sensitive
to assumed variations, the mass distributions are robust predictions. Finally, we consider the recently
reported results of the analysis of the ﬁrst 16 double-coincident days of the O1 LIGO observing run,
and ﬁnd that this formation channel is fully consistent with the inferred parameters of the GW150914
binary black hole detection and the inferred merger rate.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The detection of

the

gravitational-wave

signal
GW150914 on September 14, 2015 from the inspiral and
merger of two black holes with masses around 30M(cid:12) by
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory
(LIGO) has provided the ﬁrst robust evidence that black
holes with such masses exist, that they can form in bi-
nary pairs, and that they coalesce at an inferred local
rate of 2–400 Gpc−3yr−1 (Abbott et al. 2016a,b,c).
Predictions for the rate of binary black hole mergers
varied widely due to the lack of direct observational evi-
dence (Abadie et al. 2010). Empirical estimates are avail-
able for the merger rates of binary neutron stars, based
on the observed populations of double neutron stars (e.g.
Phinney 1991; Narayan et al. 1991; Kim et al. 2003;
O’Shaughnessy & Kim 2010).
In contrast, for double
black hole mergers the population of direct progenitors
is not accessible and the rate prediction fully relied on
the predictions of stellar and binary evolutionary models
integrated into population synthesis simulations. Sev-
eral groups predicted that the gravitational-wave signals
of binary black hole mergers would potentially dominate
LIGO observations (e.g. Lipunov et al. 1997; Voss & Tau-
ris 2003; Belczynski et al. 2010; Dominik et al. 2015), but
these analyses also demonstrated the signiﬁcant uncer-
tainties in these predictions (e.g. Dominik et al. 2012; de
Mink & Belczynski 2015).
The detection of GW150914 within the ﬁrst 16 days
of the advanced LIGO O1 observing run with two de-
tectors operating in coincidence has provided the ﬁrst
stringent empirical constraints of the binary black hole
merger rate. Assuming the results are representative,
this implies the possibility of hundreds of detections per
year as the detectors reach full design sensitivity and the
duration of the runs with both detectors online increases
(Abbott et al. 2016; Abbott et al. 2016c,b, 2010). This

will make it possible to constrain the formation chan-
nels for what is by far the most intriguing outcome of
massive binary evolution, the coalescence of two gravita-
tional singularities (e.g., Bulik & Belczyński 2003; Man-
del & O’Shaughnessy 2010; Stevenson et al. 2015; Mandel
et al. 2015).
Diﬀerent channels have been proposed for the forma-
tion of double black hole binaries that can coalesce within
a Hubble time. These include:

(i) dynamical formation, which requires a dense star
cluster (e.g., Sigurdsson & Hernquist 1993; Porte-
gies Zwart & McMillan 2000; Miller & Lauburg
2009; Rodriguez et al. 2015; Antonini et al. 2016).
(ii) classical isolated binary evolution through highly
non-conservative mass transfer or common enve-
lope ejection (e.g., Tutukov & Yungelson 1973,
1993; Kalogera et al. 2007; Belczynski et al. 2016);
and

(iii) chemically homogeneous evolution in tidally dis-
torted binary stars, i.e. massive stars in (near) con-
tact binaries that experience strong internal mixing
as proposed by de Mink et al. (2008, 2009a) and
further explored in the context of the formation of
binary black holes byMandel & de Mink (2016) and
Marchant et al. (2016).

The third channel, the topic of this paper, originates
from very close binary systems that are in (near) con-
tact at the onset of hydrogen burning. In such systems,
the deformation by tides of the component stars triggers
instabilities in the stellar interior that can, in principle,
drive large-scale Eddington-Sweet circulations (Endal &
Soﬁa 1978; Zahn 1992). This allows mixing of nuclear
burning products, such as helium, throughout the stel-
lar envelope. If the large-scale circulations are eﬃcient

2
enough, they will lead to a gradual enrichment of the
stellar envelope with helium, preventing the buildup of a
chemical gradient that characterizes non rotating stars in
the classical evolutionary models. This mode of evolution
is referred to as “chemically homogeneous evolution”,
originally proposed for rotating single stars by Maeder
(1987). The stars are well approximated by the clas-
sical homology relations, i.e., the approximate analytic
scaling solutions for the stellar structure equations which
assume a uniform chemical composition. They stay com-
pact during their main sequence evolution as they slowly
evolve towards the helium main sequence. This mode of
evolution gained renewed attention in the context of the
formation of the progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts
from rapidly rotating single stars (Yoon & Langer 2005;
Woosley & Heger 2006).
Here we discuss the channel proposed by de Mink et al.
(2009a), who argued that the conditions for chemically
homogeneous evolution can, in principle, be achieved in
very close massive binary systems. The classical evo-
lutionary models predict that near contact binaries with
orbital periods less than about 2 days will merge even be-
fore or soon after the completion of hydrogen burning due
to the expansion of the stars (Nelson & Eggleton 2001;
de Mink et al. 2007). On the other hand, models that ac-
count for enhanced mixing allow for the possibility that
the two stars shrink and remain within their Roche lobes.
This evolutionary channel has been explored with three
diﬀerent 1D evolutionary codes (de Mink et al. 2009b;
Song et al. 2015; Marchant et al. 2016). All three studies
report the existence of a window in the initial binary pa-
rameter space for this type of evolution when accounting
for mixing induced by rotation and angular momentum
transport by magnetic ﬁelds. The latter group even ex-
plores the evolution of over contact systems. Examples
of observed binary systems that have been proposed to
undergo (partial) chemically homogeneous evolution are
VFTS 352 (Almeida et al. 2015) and HD 5980 (Koenigs-
berger et al. 2014).
This channel naturally produces rather massive binary
black holes as the stars process a larger fraction of their
initial mass by nuclear fusion. The allowed initial bi-
nary parameter space further favors producing binary
black holes with comparable masses. The black holes
thus formed already reside in a close orbit, so that most
of them to coalesce within a Hubble time as the orbit
decays due to gravitational wave radiation. The limit-
ing factor comes from the stellar wind mass loss, which
aﬀects the ﬁnal masses as well as the ﬁnal orbital sep-
aration, and can potentially inhibit chemically homoge-
neous evolution if the binary expands to the point that
the stars signiﬁcantly spin down. The reduction of stellar
wind mass loss at low metallicity (Vink et al. 2001; Mok-
iem et al. 2007) leads to a preference for the progenitors
to form at higher redshift or in dwarf galaxies.
The Monte Carlo simulations by Mandel & de Mink
(2016) of the cosmological merger rate through this chan-
nel imply delay times of 3–11Gyr, a preference for com-
parable mass ratios q > 0.75 and typical total masses
near 50–110M(cid:12) in the default model considered there.
These simulations predict a local z = 0 merger rate
of 10 Gpc−3yr−1, peaking at a redshift of 0.5 at twice
the local rate, implying that the channel can be poten-
tially the dominating channel for binary black hole in

this mass regime. The detailed 1D evolutionary models
by Marchant et al. (2016) focus on over contact systems,
which produce mass ratios closer to unity, higher total
masses, a larger range of delay times and somewhat lower
rates due to the stronger preference for low metallicity.
The aim of this paper, which is a companion paper to
Mandel & de Mink (2016), is to provide the expected de-
tection rates as well as the distributions of masses, mass
ratios and chirp masses of detectable events that form
through this channel. We provide estimates for the antic-
ipated ﬁnal design sensitivity, as well as for the lower sen-
sitivity achieved during the 16 day portion of the O1 run
which led to the detection of “The Event” GW150914.
We compare the parameters inferred for GW150914 with
the estimates and conclude they are fully consistent. We
discuss the impact of variations of the model assumptions
and show that, even though the rates are substantially
uncertain, the preference for high masses and mass ra-
tios similar to GW150914 is a robust prediction of this
channel.
We make the full output of our simulations available
online for the community at http://www.sr.bham.ac.
uk/~imandel/CaseM, in order to allow further compar-
isons with current and future data and with simulations
of other channels.

2. MODEL ASSUMPTIONS

Our simulations of massive close binary populations
over cosmic time are described in Mandel & de Mink
(2016, hereafter MdM16), to which we refer for a full
description. Here, we summarize the key assumptions.

2.1. The cosmological merger rate

We perform a Monte Carlo simulation drawing the ini-
tial parameters of massive binary systems from a Kroupa
initial mass function for the primary star (Kroupa & Wei-
dner 2003), a ﬂat mass ratio distribution (e.g. Sana et al.
2012; Kobulnicky et al. 2014) and a distribution of or-
bital periods appropriate for O-type stars (Sana et al.
2012) as detailed in MdM16. We follow the evolution of
the systems, parametrizing our assumptions as described
below. We check if the stars ﬁt within their Roche lobes
at zero age using the radii of zero age main sequence stars
based on models computed with Eggleton’s evolutionary
code (Pols et al. 1995; Glebbeek et al. 2008). We assume
that the stellar spin is synchronized with the orbit and
the orbits are circular, which is appropriate for the short
period systems of interest (Zahn 1989). Using the spin
frequency and stellar radius we compute the fraction of
the Keplerian rotation rate, which we compare with the
threshold for chemically homogeneous evolution in the
detailed models by Yoon et al. (2006). These are 1D hy-
drodynamical evolutionary models that solve the stellar
structure equations accounting for the eﬀect of the cen-
trifugal acceleration and rotationally driven instabilities
(Endal & Soﬁa 1976; Heger et al. 2000), which lead to the
transport of chemical elements and angular momentum.
These models further account for internal magnetic ﬁelds
(Spruit 2002). For the chemically homogeneous evolution
threshold we use the expression given in Section 4.3 of
MdM16. Following Yoon et al. (2006), we adopt a max-
imum metallicity threshold of Z = 0.004.
If the system fulﬁlls the criteria for chemically homo-
geneous evolution we follow the evolution by account-

ing for the eﬀects of mass and angular momentum loss
driven by stellar winds and the ﬁnal supernova explo-
sions via the simple parametrized approach described in
MdM16. We account for the eﬀect of mass loss on the
orbital separation and the masses of the ﬁnal remnants.
We only consider systems in whcih both star fulﬁll the
threshold for chemically homogeneous evolution through-
out their main sequence evolution. We consider the pos-
sibility that the most massive helium stars lead to pair-
instability supernovae leaving no remnant, by adopting
an upper limit of 63M(cid:12) (Heger & Woosley 2002) for the
ﬁnal, pre-explosion mass of the star. We do not consider
systems that are more massive than the pair instability
regime. Given the high orbital velocities in these massive
close systems, the eﬀect of possible natal kicks accompa-
nying collapse to black holes can be ignored. We account
for the decay of the orbit by energy and angular momen-
tum loss due to the emission of gravitational waves as in
Peters (1964).
To compute the cosmological merger rate history we
adopt a standard ﬂat cosmology with ΩΛ = 0.718 and
h0 = 0.697 (Hinshaw et al. 2013). We adopt the star
formation rate d2MSFR/(dtdVc) (z) per unit source time
per unit comoving volume as a function of redshift z from
Madau & Dickinson (2014, Eq. 15 in their work). For
the metallicity distribution as a function of redshift we
follow Langer & Norman (2006), which is based on the
mass-metallicity relation of Savaglio et al. (2005) and
the average cosmic metallicity scaling of Kewley & Kob-
ulnicky (2005, 2007). For the average present day metal-
licity we conservatively use 1.06 times solar metallicity,
Z(cid:12) = 0.0134 (Asplund et al. 2009). We implicitly assume
that the initial mass function and other binary properties
do not depend on metallicity or redshift. This is reason-
able since the fraction of binaries of interest formed in
metal-free population III stars or extremely metal-poor
stars is very small within this framework of assumptions
and the merger rate is dominated by systems with metal-
licity near the maximum threshold metallicity. For this
metallicity observations indicate no evidence for a vary-
ing IMF (Kroupa 2002).
The rate density of binary black hole mergers is given
in MdM16, Eq. (8), as the number of mergers Nmerge

further information we refer to MdM16.

2.2. Detection rates

We convert the cosmological merger rate into a rate
of detections by advanced LIGO (LIGO Scientiﬁc Col-
laboration et al. 2015) and Virgo (Acernese et al. 2015)
detectors per unit observer time by folding in the gravi-
tational waveform models and the detector sensitivity:

today. The term 1/(1+z) reﬂects the time dilation of the
source clock (with which all times are measured unless
otherwise speciﬁed) with respect to the observer clock
tobs. We evaluate these integrals with a Monte Carlo
simulation.
We model the gravitational-wave emission from a bi-
nary by using the IMRPhenomB waveform approximant
(Ajith et al. 2011). This waveform includes the post-
Newtonian inspiral and the perturbative ring down, con-
nected by a smooth merger via a phenomenological ap-
proximation calibrated to numerical relativity simula-
tions. Although we expect the spins of the stars to be
aligned by tides for this formation channel, the orienta-
tion and magnitude of the spins of the black holes are un-
certain as they may be aﬀected by stochastic processes
during the collapse. For the purpose of the waveform
calculation we set the spins to zero. This generally un-
derestimates the strength of the gravitational-wave sig-
nal relative to that expected from a binary with aligned
spins, which seems likely in this scenario (MdM16). Al-
though more precise waveforms are now available, the
accuracy provided by IMRPhenomB is suﬃcient for our
purposes here, especially since most of our binaries have
mass ratios close to unity.
As described in (MdM16), our Monte Carlo simulation
generates a set of simulated merging binary black holes,
which we label with an index k. We divide the history
of the Universe into a large number of bins by redshift,
which we label with an index j. For each sample binary k,
we redshift the waveform to account for the cosmological
expansion of the Universe, thus producing a redshifted
frequency-domain waveform ˜h(f)k,j for each merger bin
j corresponding to redshift zj. We compute the signal-
to-noise ratio ρ at which an optimal (face-on, overhead)
source at this redshift and its corresponding luminosity
distance dL(zj) would be detected by a single advanced
LIGO interferometer:

k,j = 4

Here, Sn(f) is the noise power spectral density of the
detectors. To estimate detectability at full design sen-
sitivity, we use the so-called zero-detuning, high-power
conﬁguration (Abbott et al. 2010). For estimates at O1
sensitivity, we use the reference O1 noise curve Abbott
et al. (2015) (see Abbott et al. (2016d) for associated
calibration accuracy).
The signal-to-noise ratio will depend on the source lo-
cation on the sky relative to the detector and the source
orientation. The projection coeﬃcient Θ as a function
of these angles is given by Finn (1996). We choose a
single-detector threshold signal-to-noise ratio ρt = 8 as
a proxy for the detectability of the source by a network;
the detection probability for the given source at a given
redshift is then (e.g., Belczynski et al. 2014)

1/(1 + z).

3. RESULTS

We provide predictions for the number of detectable
events and their distribution, and compare these with
observed values based on The Event, GW150914. These
results are summarized in Table 1.

3.1. Cosmic merger rate and the local merger rate
The overall cosmic merger rate is shown in Figure 1 for
our default simulation. The shape follows the rise and fall
of the cosmic star formation rate for low metallicity stars
(see also Fig. 3 & 8 in MdM16), shifted by the time delay
between the the birth of a massive binary star progenitor
system and the ﬁnal merger of the two black holes. The
typical time delay in our default model is 4-11 Gyr (cf.,
Fig. 6 in MdM16). As a result, the earliest mergers occur
at a redshift of z ∼ 1.5, and the merger rate reaches a
maximum of about 20 Gpc−3yr−1 at z ∼ 0.4 after which
it drops by a factor 2 at z = 0.
The local merger rate derived from our default model,
10 Gpc−3yr−1 and the estimates obtained when we vary
our model assumptions (see Table 1 of MdM16) are
consistent 1 with the conservative inferred range of 2–
400 Gpc−3yr−1 from 16 days of double coincident ad-
vanced LIGO O1 observations (Abbott et al. 2016c).
The inference is based on The Event as well as lower-
signiﬁcance triggers assuming a redshift-independent vol-
umetric merger rate. The ranges allow for diﬀerent un-
derlying mass distributions for the BH-BH population.

3.2. Detection rate
predicts

Our

that

default model

advanced
gravitational-wave detectors operating at
full de-
sign sensitivity could observe 470 ± 25 events per year
of coincident observation resulting from binary black
hole mergers formed through the Case M scenario.
The error bar given here corresponds exclusively to
the numerical uncertainty of the Monte Carlo integral,
and does not include the systematic uncertainties in
the assumed model, which are discussed in the next
section. The corresponding rate for the sensitivity of
the ﬁrst observing run implies about 40 events per year.
This scales to 1–2 detections for the ﬁrst 16 days of
double-coincident O1 observations.
The 16 day double-coincident O1 run yielded one sig-
niﬁcant detection as well as one candidate event of lower
signiﬁcance, which has a posterior probability larger than
0.8 to be of astrophysical origin. No other triggers with
signiﬁcance larger than 0.5 were reported (Abbott et al.
2016c). These ﬁndings are consistent with the predic-
tion of 1-2 events in our default model and the ranges
obtained when exploring variations discussed section 4.

zero detectable events from this channel as we discuss below.

3.3. Redshift distribution of detectable mergers

full design (O1) sensitivity.

The reach of gravitational-wave instruments is limited.
The gravitational-wave strain and, hence, the signal-to-
noise ratio are inversely proportional to the luminosity
distance. Therefore, detection eﬃciency drops as a func-
tion of distance (redshift), with only the most massive
and favorably located and oriented sources detectable at
higher redshifts. As a result, the redshift distribution of
detectable events is shifted toward lower redshifts with
respect to the total merging binary population. This is
shown in Figure 1. The corresponding cumulative distri-
butions of the redshift of detectable events is shown in
the lower panels of Figure 1.
The median redshift for detectable sources is z ∼ 0.5 in
our default simulation for full design sensitivity. During
the less sensitive O1 run we are biased to events occurring
at smaller redshifts and the median redshift of detections
is z ∼ 0.2. The redshift inferred for The Event, z =
0.09+0.03−0.04 (Abbott et al. 2016e), lies approximately at the
lower tenth percentile of the simulated distribution of
detectable mergers for O1 sensitivity.
We also provide the cumulative distribution of the red-
shift of formation for the detectable events in the lower
panels of Figure 1. The typical events observable at full
sensitivity result from systems that were formed at red-
shifts z ∼1–4.8 (90% range), implying that they probe
star formation and massive star evolution during and
prior to the cosmic star formation peak.
MdM16 found that a total of ∼ 1250 binary black holes
merge per year of local (z = 0) observer time after form-
ing through the chemically homogeneous evolution chan-
nel. The detection rate calculations described above in-
dicate that ∼ 40% (∼ 3%) of all potentially observable
mergers could be detected with instruments operating at

3.4. Total masses, chirp masses and mass ratios

In Figure 2 we show the predicted distributions of
properties that can in principle be inferred from the
gravitational-wave signals of detected sources. Distri-
butions for sources detectable at full design sensitivity
are shown in the top row and the predictions for those
detectable at O1 sensitivity are in the lower panels, to-
gether with the inferred parameters of GW150914.
There is a strong preference for events resulting from
systems with comparable masses for the individual black
holes. There are no binaries of interest with mass ratios
q = m2/m1 < 0.5 and more than two thirds of detec-
tions come from sources with q > 0.8, as can be seen in
the left-hand panels in Figure 2. The preference for equal
masses is a robust prediction of this evolutionary scenario
(section 4) and is independent of the assumed detector
sensitivity. The inferred mass ratio for The Event is con-
sistent with these predictions.
We further show the distributions for the chirp mass,
Mc = m
(m1 + m2)−1/5, and total mass, mtot =
m1+m2 in the central and right-hand panels of Figure 2.
The chirp mass is a combination of component masses
m1,2 which governs the phase evolution of gravitational
waves at the leading order during the inspiral phase, and
is therefore the most readily observable parameter for
low-mass binaries. However, for high-mass systems of in-
terest here, typically only the late stages of the inspiral
fall within the sensitive frequency band of the detectors.
The total mass therefore becomes the more accurately
measurable mass parameter (Veitch et al. 2015; Graﬀ
et al. 2015; Haster et al. 2015). We provide both dis-
tributions for ease of comparison with other predictions
in the literature. Both the source-frame and redshifted

Figure 3. Two-dimensional parameter distributions are shown for detectable systems at full design sensitivity (top panels) and O1
sensitivity (bottom panels). The left-hand panels shows the joint 2D distribution of the mass ratio q = m2/m2 and redshifted total mass,
(m1 + m2)(1 + z). Color shading indicates the number of detectable events per bin of 0.05 in q and 10M(cid:12) in mass. The right-hand panel
shows the time delay and chirp masses of individual simulated binaries in our Monte Carlo simulation. The color and size of the symbol
indicates the contribution of these systems to the detection rate. The approximate uncertainty intervals corresponding to the inferred The
Event parameters are overplotted in both panels.
m → m(1 + z) masses are given. The redshifted quan-
tities are the direct eﬀect of the cosmological redshift of
the gravitational waves in an expanding universe. The
mass–redshift degeneracy (Krolak & Schutz 1987) can be
broken by converting the luminosity distance, inferred
from the gravitational-wave amplitude, into a redshift,
using standard cosmology; this makes it possible to ex-
tract source-frame masses (e.g. Haster et al. 2015).
The source frame chirp masses and total masses show
practically no dependence on detector sensitivity.
In
other words, the distributions of chirp masses and total
masses of detectable binaries do not signiﬁcantly evolve
with redshift. The median source frame chirp masses
are Mc,full = 35+10−10 M(cid:12) and Mc,O1 = 34+11−10 M(cid:12) for full
and O1 detector sensitivity respectively, where the er-
ror bars indicate the 90% conﬁdence intervals. These
values are consistent with the parameters inferred for
The Event Mc,GW150914 = 28+2−2 M(cid:12). The correspond-
ing total source frame masses are mtot,full = 82+21−25 M(cid:12)
and mtot,O1 = 80+24−24 M(cid:12) respectively, also consistent
with the value inferred for The Event mtot,GW150914 =
65+5−4 M(cid:12). The Event is also consistent with the distri-
bution of redshifted chirp masses and total masses, al-
though it resides on the lower side of the redshifted mass
distributions, in line with its small inferred redshift.
In Figure 3 we provide two further visualizations of our
simulations showing two-dimensional distributions.
In
the left-hand panel of Figure 3 we show the joint distri-
bution of the mass ratio and redshifted total mass for full

design sensitivity and O1 sensitivity. The inferred ranges
for The Event are over plotted. In the right-hand pan-
els we display the properties of the individual simulated
merging binaries in our Monte Carlo simulations, show-
ing the delay time versus chirp mass. The size and color
of the symbols shows how much these simulated systems
contribute to the overall detection rate. The largest con-
tributions come from binaries in the bottom right of the
diagram, i.e., systems with relatively short time delays
and high masses which emit stronger gravitational-wave
signals, detectable at greater distances. The preference
for short delay times is less strong for the events de-
tectable in the 16 days double-coincident O1 run, which
probes a smaller volume, therefore preferring late-time
mergers. The local merger rate instead is dominated by
lower mass events with relatively long delay times (as can
be seen in Figure 9 of MdM16), and the local detection
rate is a trade-oﬀ between this and the greater sensitivity
to more massive systems.
The predicted distributions show a stronger preference
for high masses than either classical population-synthesis
predictions for ﬁeld binary black holes (e.g., Dominik
et al. 2015) or dynamically formed binary black hole
models in globular clusters (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 2015).
All merging binaries formed through this channel have
total masses (cid:38) 50M(cid:12) under the default model assump-
tions. Furthermore, we ﬁnd no delay times shorter than
3 Gyr which has implications for the detectable stochas-

4. ROBUSTNESS OF RESULTS AGAINST MODEL

VARIATIONS

Substantial uncertainties in these simulations arise
from several sources:
(i) the assumptions for the ini-
tial conditions, (ii) the physics of the evolution of the
systems (in particular the eﬃciency of the mixing pro-
cesses, the mass and angular momentum losses), (iii)
cosmological assumptions, and (iv) assumptions regard-
ing gravitational-wave detectability. The impact of the
initial conditions such as the binary fraction and the
adopted distribution functions for the binary parameters
has been quantiﬁed by de Mink & Belczynski (2015) for
the classical isolated binary scenario. They concluded
that the impact of uncertainties in the initial distribu-
tions is fully dominated by uncertainties in the initial
mass function, which accounts for a factor 8 up and down
in the overall rate, with very little to no eﬀect on the dis-
tribution of the properties of double black hole mergers.
In MdM16 we quantiﬁed various aspects of the impact
of (ii) and (iii) on the local (z = 0) merger rate, as well
as the maximum cosmological merger rate and the red-
shift at which the maximum is reached. Here, we provide
a similar exploration, now probing the impact of model
variations on the detection rate for full design sensitivity
observations Rdetect(full), the number of detections ex-
pected for the 16 days of double-coincident O1 observa-
tions analyzed so far Ndetect (O1) (Abbott et al. 2016g),
as well as the median and 90% conﬁdence intervals on
the chirp mass, total mass, mass ratio and component
masses in the source frame. Results for all model varia-
tions are summarized in Table 1.
The variations we consider include a simulation which
allows for the possibility that mixing processes are less
eﬃcient, reducing the window for chemically homoge-
neous evolution in binary systems PoorMixing, and vari-
ations in the threshold metallicity for chemically homoge-
neous evolution Zmin0.002m and Zmin0.008 (described
and discussed in sect. 7.1 of MdM16). We further con-
sider variations in the angular momentum loss by the
stellar winds ConstA and HalvedA and mass loss Mdot2
and Mdot0.2, and a model which combines enhanced
mass loss with higher angular momentum loss from the
system due to wind speeds comparable to the orbital
velocity Mdot2ConstA (sect. 7.2 and 7.3 of MdM16). Fi-
nally we consider the uncertainty in the threshold for
pair instability supernova PISN80 and a variation of the
assumed metallicity spread at each redshift Dex0.5, see
sect. 7.4 & 7.5 of Mandel & de Mink (2016). One vari-
ation, Mdot2, corresponding to a doubling of the mass
loss, predicts no detectable events.
The predictions for the detection rate at full sensitivity
vary substantially, Rdetect(full) = 90 − 1500 per year for
all models with non-zero predictions. On the other hand,
the prediction for the number of detections in the 16
days of double-coincident O1 data analyzed so far varies
between Ndetect(O1) = 0.3−2.5 with only two exceptions:
model Mdot2 predicts no detections and model Dex0.5
predicts 10 detections.
We ﬁnd that the preference for relatively high chirp
and total masses is a robust prediction seen in all model
variations that yield detectable events. Model variation
Mdot2ConstA in which we adopted enhanced wind mass

7
loss results in the lowest median masses. Model PISN80
results in the highest median masses. This model in-
creases the maximum ﬁnal mass at which stars can be-
come black holes (instead of exploding in a pair instabil-
ity supernova which would leave no remnant). The pref-
erence for comparable masses is also a robust prediction.
The preference for equal masses becomes stronger when
we consider a reduced eﬃciency of tidally induced mix-
ing PoorMixing, q > 0.72, and it is least strong for the
model with reduced mass loss and enhanced angular mo-
mentum loss through slow winds Mdot2ConstA, q > 0.55.
At this time, all models apart from Dex0.5 are con-
sistent with the number of detections observed during
the ﬁrst 16 days of double-coincident observation from
the O1 run after accounting for Poison statistics and the
possibility that this channel is not the only channel that
contributes to binary black hole detections.

4.1. Uncertainties in the gravitational-wave detectability
We use a single-detector signal-to-noise ratio thresh-
old of 8 as a proxy for detectability by the LIGO-Virgo
network. In practice, gravitational-wave search pipelines
(e.g., Babak et al. 2013; Cannon et al. 2012) use more
complex statistics than the signal-to-noise ratio to treat
non-stationary, non-Gaussian noise backgrounds. As a
result, the actual sensitivity of advanced gravitational-
wave detectors will depend on the details of the network
(such as the number of detectors operating in coincidence
at a given time, which in turn depends on their duty fac-
tor), the detector data quality, the speciﬁc algorithms
used for the search, and even the details of the source,
such as the component masses.
Moreover, the spins of the binary components can have
a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the gravitational-wave signal. This
large aligned
is particularly true for massive binaries:
spins can enhance the strength of the signal, possibly in-
creasing the detector sensitive volume by factors of ∼ 2
(see, e.g., ﬁgure 6 of Belczynski et al. 2014). Therefore,
our detectability predictions are simpliﬁcations which
must be treated with caution; however, the uncertain-
ties involved are likely smaller than those in the physics
governing the evolution of the binary systems.
The detection rate predictions are based on advanced
LIGO detectors operating at either full sensitivity or O1
sensitivity. The detectors will gradually evolve in sensi-
tivity between 2015 and the end of the decade, with sev-
eral scheduled data-taking runs interspersed with com-
missioning breaks (Abbott et al. 2016). While the exact
predictions for any intermediate runs depend on the ex-
act shape of the detector noise spectrum and must take
into account the cosmological variations in merger rates
as described above, a crude estimate can be made by as-
suming that the detection rate scales with the surveyed
volume (see Fig. 4 of Abbott et al. 2016b).

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

The channel for chemically homogeneous evolution in
tidally distorted massive binary systems is of large in-
terest in light of current searches for binary black hole
mergers. The high component masses and comparable
masses for the components inferred for GW150914 are
a natural and robust outcome of this evolutionary chan-
nel. The predicted detection rate is less certain but fully

Quantiﬁcation of the impact of model variations on our predictions and a comparison with GW150914. We list Rdetect, the detection rate
at full design sensitivity; Ndetect (O1), the expected number of detections at the sensitivity of O1 for a 16 day period of double-coincident
observations; the median and 90% intervals for the mass parameters that can be inferred from the waveforms, where Mc is the chirp mass,
mtot the total mass, q = m2/m1 the mass ratio with component masses m1 > m2. For the mass ratio we provide the 90% lower bound on
the q. We list the union of the 90% ranges as “combined” parameters. All parameters refer to the distributions of detectable events at full
design sensitivity, unless otherwise indicated. For comparison, we provide the parameters inferred for GW150914 in the source frame. The

reader may also wish to compare with the candidate event mentioned in Abbott et al. (2016g), if it is indeed of astrophysical origin.

consistent with the ﬁrst 16 days of double-coincident O1
observations.
At present, with a single conﬁdent detection, it is not
possible to distinguish between this channel, the clas-
sical channel for isolated binary evolution, and the dy-
namical formation channel. However, the near future
prospect of up to hundreds of detections per year (Ab-
bott et al. 2016c) will probe the demographics of stellar
mass binary black holes. This, together with measure-
ments of the stochastic background from individually un-
resolvable mergers (e.g. Abbott et al. 2016f), will provide
constraints on the formation mechanisms.
Our default model predicts about 500 detections per
year at full design sensitivity, corresponding to about 1.8
detections in 16 days of O1-sensitivity data. The model
variations we consider give variations by factors of 3–5
up or down, although the possibility of zero detections
from this channel can not be excluded at this stage.
The preference for binary black hole mergers with com-
parable component masses is a robust outcome of all
models considered here (in all model variations we ﬁnd
that 90% of the detectable events have mass ratios q
larger than 0.55). The same holds for the preference
for high total and chirp masses (the median total mass
ranges from 59 to 93 M(cid:12) in the model variations we con-
sider).
Possible future detections of binary black hole mergers
with signiﬁcantly unequal component masses or low total
masses will be evidence in favor of contributions by the
classical isolated binary channel and/or the dynamical
formation channel. At 90% conﬁdence, none of the model
variations predict total masses below 32 M(cid:12) or mass ra-

tios q < 0.55. Observations outside these boundaries are
unlikely to arise from this channel in which both stars
evolve chemically homogeneously. However, it would be
interesting to explore variations of this evolutionary path
in which only one of the stars evolves chemically homo-
geneously.
We ﬁnd that the cosmological merger rate peaks at a
redshift of 0.4 with the majority of events being just out
of reach of the full design sensitivity of the detectors.
We ﬁnd no mergers beyond z = 1.5 in the default model.
This has implications for the stochastic background sig-
nal that can be tested against predictions from other bi-
nary black hole formation channels.
Although the simulated merger and detection rates
for this channel are sensitive to model uncertainties,
this channel does not suﬀer from the key physics un-
certainties that aﬀect the classical isolated binary evolu-
tionary channel, namely the treatment of unstable and
non conservative mass transfer, common envelope ejec-
tion events, and the still unconstrained black hole birth
kicks. Further eﬀorts are needed to advance detailed one-
dimensional (such as Marchant et al. 2016) and three-
dimensional simulations of the physical processes aﬀect-
ing massive near-contact binaries. If future disentangling
of the contributions by diﬀerent scenarios becomes pos-
sible, gravitational-wave events will provide interesting
constraints on the unique physics of the mixing processes
that govern this channel.
