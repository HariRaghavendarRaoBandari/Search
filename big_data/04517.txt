On the derivative at t = 1 of the skew-growth functions

for Artin monoids.

Tadashi Ishibe

Abstract

Let G+
M be the Artin monoid of ﬁnite type generated by the letters ai, i ∈ I
with respect to a Coxeter matrix M that is equipped with the degree map
deg : G+
M → Z≥0 deﬁned by assigning to each equivalence class of words the

length of the words, and let NM,deg(t) :=PJ ⊂I (−1)#J tdeg(∆J ) be the skew-

growth function, where the summation index J runs over all subsets of I and
∆J is the fundamental element in G+
M associated to the set J. In this article, we
will calculate the derivative at t = 1 of the polynomial NM,deg(t). As a result,
we show that the polynomial NM,deg(t) has a simple root at t = 1.

Keywords: Artin monoid, growth function, zeroes of polynomial

1. Introduction

Let G+

M be the Artin monoid of ﬁnite type ([B-S]§1) generated by the letters
ai, i ∈ I with respect to a Coxeter matrix M ([B]). Due to the homogeneity of
the deﬁning relations in G+
M → Z≥0 deﬁned
by assigning to each equivalence class of words the length of the words. The
spherical growth function for the monoid G+

M , we naturally deﬁne a map deg : G+

M is deﬁned as

PG+

M ,deg(t) := Xu∈G+

M

tdeg(u).

In [A-N][Bro][S1], they show that the inversion function PG+
by the following function, called the skew-growth function,

M ,deg(t)−1 is given

NM,deg(t) := XJ ⊂I

(−1)#J tdeg(∆J ),

where the summation index J runs over all subsets of I and ∆J is the fundamen-
tal element in G+
M associated to the set J ([B-S]§5). That has been investigated
by several authors ([A-N][B][Bro][D][I1][I2][S1][S2][S3][S4][X]). In [B-S]§4, the
authors show that the monoid G+
M satisﬁes the LCM condition (i.e. any two
elements α and β in it admit the left (resp. right) least common multiple). By
using this property, for a subset J ⊂ I, they deﬁned the fundamental element
∆J , as the right least common multiple of all the letters ai, i ∈ J. In [S1]§4, it

is observed that the polynomial NM,deg(t) has a simple root at t = 1. In this
article, we will calculate the derivative at t = 1 of the polynomial NM,deg(t).
As a result, we show that the polynomial NM,deg(t) has a simple root at t = 1.

Our main theorem is the following.

Theorem 1.1. For a Coxeter matrix M , the derivative at t = 1 of the polynomial
NM,deg(t) is given by the following list:
Al≥1 : N ′
Bl≥2 : N ′
Dl≥4 : N ′
N ′
E6 :
N ′
E7 :

M,deg(1) = (−1)l,
N ′
E8 :
M,deg(1) = (−1)ll,
N ′
F4 :
M,deg(1) = (−1)l(l − 2), H3 :
N ′
N ′
H4 :
M,deg(1) = 7,
I2(p ≥ 5): N ′
M,deg(1) = −16,

M,deg(1) = 44,
M,deg(1) = 10,
M,deg(1) = −8,
M,deg(1) = 42,
M,deg(1) = p − 2.

The above statement can be veriﬁed by hand calculation for the types
E6, E7, E8, F4, H3, H4 and I2(p ≥ 5).
In §3, we will prove Theorem 1.1 for
the type Al. By using the results in §3, we will prove Theorem 1.1 for the type
Bl and Dl in §4, §5. As a corollary of Theorem 1.1, we obtain the following.

Corollary 1.2. The polynomial NM,deg(t) has a simple root at t = 1.

2. Preliminary results

Let l be a positive integer and let I = {1, 2, . . . , l}. The Coxeter matrix
M = (m(α, β))α,β∈I of the type Xl ∈ {Al, Bl, Dl} is given by the following list.
For the type Al, we give

For the type Dl, we give

m(α, β) =

from that in [B].

We simply write the polynomial NM,deg(t) by NXl(t). Namely, we put

NXl(t) := XJ ⊂I

(−1)#J tdeg(∆Xl ,J ),

where ∆Xl,J is the fundamental element in the Artin monoid G+
the set J. Moreover, for a non-negative integer j ∈ { 0, . . . , l } we put

M associated to

NXl,j(t) := XJ ⊂I, #J=j

tdeg(∆Xl ,J ), CXl,j :=

dNXl,j(t)

dt

Therefore, we have the following equations:

.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1

N ′

Xl (1) =

lXj=1

(−1)jCXl,j, CXl,j = XJ ⊂I, #J=j

deg(∆Xl,J ).

To a Coxeter matrix M = (m(α, β))α,β∈I of the type Xl, we attach a Coxeter
graph ΓXl whose vertices are indexed by the set I and two vertices α and β are
connected by an edge iﬀ m(α, β) ≥ 3. For a subset J ⊂ I, we associate a full
subgraph ΓXl(J), whose vertices are indexed by the set J. The edge is labeled
by m(α, β) (omitted if m(α, β) = 3). We note that ΓXl (I) corresponds to the
graph ΓXl . For a subgraph ΓXl (J) of ΓXl, we write the number of connected
components of ΓXl(J) by kXl (J). Let ΓXl (J) be a full subgraph of ΓXl with
k-connected components ΓXl(J1), ΓXl (J2), . . . , ΓXl (Jk). Then, we write

ΓXl (J) =

kGi=1

ΓXl(Ji).

We recall a fact from [B-S].

Proposition 2.1. For a subset J ⊂ I, we suppose that the full subgraph ΓXl(J)

has a decomposition ΓXl (J) =Fk

i=1 ΓXl(Ji). Then:

(1) For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k, ∆Xl,Ji and ∆Xl,Jj commute with each other.
(2) Then, the fundamental element ∆Xl,J can be written as a product of the
fundamental elements ∆Xl,J1 , . . . , ∆Xl,Jk:

∆Xl,J =. ∆Xl,J1 · · · ∆Xl,Jk .

Since the map deg is an additive map, we can compute

deg(∆Xl,J ) =

kXi=1

deg(∆Xl,Ji).

3. Proof of the type Al

Let l be a positive integer and let I = {1, 2, . . . , l}. In this section, we will

prove Theorem 1.1 for the type Al. First, we have a remark on kAl(J).

Proposition 3.1. For a subset J ⊂ I, we put j := #J. Then:
(1) If the number j satiﬁes an inequality 1 ≤ j ≤ ⌈ l
connected components kAl(J) can run over from 1 to j.
(2)If the number j satiﬁes an inequality j > ⌈ l
components kAl (J) can run over from 1 to l − j + 1.
We put βl,j := min{j, l − j + 1}. Then, the summary of Proposition 3.1 is that
the number of connected components kAl(J) can run over from 1 to βl,j. For
two positive integers j and k with j ≤ l and k ≤ βl,j, we put

2 ⌉, then the number of connected

By deﬁnition, we have

We recall a fact from [B-S].
Proposition 3.2. For a subset J ⊂ I, we suppose that the full subgraph ΓAl(J)
is connected. Then, the degree deg(∆Al,J ) of the fundamental element is given
by

deg(∆Al,J ) =(cid:18)#(J) + 1

(cid:19).

From the equation (2.1), we easily show the following formula.
Proposition 3.3. For a subset J ⊂ I, we suppose that the full subgraph ΓAl(J)

tal element ∆Al,J can be written as

Proposition 3.4. Let j and k be two positive integers with j ≤ l and k ≤ βl,j. For
i=1 τi = j, we deﬁne the set Sj,(τ1,...,τk)

given positive integers τ1, . . . , τk with Pk
(cid:26)J ⊂ I(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Then, we have the following equation

Lemma 3.5. Let j and k be two positive integers with j ≤ l and k ≤ βl,j. Then,
the following equation Ej,k holds.

Al,j = k(cid:18)j + 1
k + 1(cid:19).
eC(k)

Proof. We will show the general equation Ej,k by double induction. First,
for k = 1, the subgraph ΓAl(J) is connected. Hence, we easily compute

deg(∆Al,J ) = (cid:0)j+1

2 (cid:1). Therefore, we say the equation Ej,1 is true. Next, for

induction hypothesis, we assume
(A) Ej,k is true for j = 1, . . . , r and arbitrary k,
and
(B) Er+1,k is true for 1 ≤ k ≤ s − 1.
We will show the equation Er+1,s. For a positive integer i ∈ {1, . . . , r−s+2}, we
consider the set {(τ1, . . . , τs) ∈ Ts,j|τ1 = i}. Then, we easily count the number

(A) and (B) to (τ2, . . . , τs), we have

#{(τ1, . . . , τs) ∈ Ts,j|τ1 = i} = (cid:0)r−i

4. Proof of the type Bl

Let l be a positive integer in Z≥2 and let I = {1, 2, . . . , l}. In this section,

we will prove Theorem 1.1 for the type Bl. We recall a fact from [B-S].

Proposition 4.1. For a subset J ⊂ I, we suppose that the full subgraph ΓBl(J)
is connected. Then, the degree deg(∆Bl,J ) of the fundamental element is given
by

deg(∆Bl,J ) =(cid:26) #(J)2
(cid:0)#(J)+1
(cid:1)

if J ⊃ {1, 2}
if J 6⊃ {1, 2}

decomposition ΓBl(J) = Fk

From the equation (2.1), if the full subgraph ΓBl(J) for a subset J ⊂ I has a
i=1 ΓBl(Ji) with min(J1) < · · · < min(Jk), then we
can compute the degree deg(∆Bl,J ) of the fundamental element. In the case of
J1 6⊃ {1, 2}, we compute

deg(∆Bl,J ) =

kXi=1

deg(∆Bl,Ji) =

(cid:18)#(Ji) + 1
(cid:19).

Moreover, in the case of J1 ⊃ {1, 2}, we compute

Proof. We compute the diﬀerence between N ′

Bl
tions (4.1) and (4.2), we only have to count the case when the set J1 contains
the index set {1, 2}. For a positive integer u ∈ {2, . . . , l − 2} and Xl ∈ {Al, Bl},

This completes the proof.

5. Proof of the type Dl

Let l be a positive integer in Z≥4 and let I = {1, 2, . . . , l}. In this section,

we will prove Theorem 1.1 for the type Dl. We recall a fact from [B-S].
Proposition 5.1. For a subset J ⊂ I, we suppose that the full subgraph ΓDl(J)
is connected. Then, the degree deg(∆Dl,J ) of the fundamental element is given
by

From the equation (2.1), if the full subgraph ΓDl(J) for a subset J ⊂ I has a
decomposition ΓDl(J) = ΓDl(J1) ⊔ · · · ⊔ ΓDl (Jk) with min(J1) < · · · < min(Jk),
then we can compute the degree deg(∆Dl,J ) of the fundamental element.
Theorem 5.2. The following equality holds:

N ′

Dl (1) = (−1)l(l − 2).

Proof. We will show the statement by induction on l. First, for l = 4, we
easily compute N ′
the induction hypothesis, we will compute the diﬀerence N ′
For a positive integer u ∈ {1, . . . , l − 2}, we put

D4(1) = PJ ⊂I (−1)#J deg(∆D4,J ) = 12. Next, by applying
(cid:27)

i=1 ΓDl(Ji) with min(J1) < · · · < min(Jk)

ΓDl (J) =Fk

s.t. J1 = {1, . . . , u}

SDl,u :=(cid:26)J ⊂ I(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

For each u ∈ {1, . . . , l − 5}, the diﬀerence on SDl,u is the following

From the induction hypothesis, this is equal to (−1)l−1(l − u − 3). For u = l − 4,
the diﬀerence on SDl,l−4 is computed in a similar manner

From the induction hypothesis, we have
