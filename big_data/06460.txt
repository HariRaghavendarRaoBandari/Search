Abstract We introduce right amenability, right Følner nets, and right
paradoxical decompositions for left homogeneous spaces and prove the
Tarski-Følner theorem for left homogeneous spaces with ﬁnite stabilisers.
It states that right amenability, the existence of right Følner nets, and
the non-existence of right paradoxical decompositions are equivalent.

Keywords: amenability, group actions, Tarski-Følner theorem

The notion of amenability for groups was introduced by John von Neumann
in 1929, see the paper ‘Zur allgemeinen Theorie des Maßes’[4]. It generalises the
notion of ﬁniteness. A group G is left or right amenable if there is a ﬁnitely
additive probability measure on P(G) that is invariant under left and right
multiplication respectively. Groups are left amenable if and only if they are
right amenable. A group is amenable if it is left or right amenable.

The deﬁnitions of left and right amenability generalise to left and right group
sets respectively. A left group set (M, G, ⊲) is left amenable if there is a ﬁnitely
additive probability measure on P(M ) that is invariant under ⊲. There is in
general no natural action on the right that is to a left group action what right
multiplication is to left group multiplication. Therefore, for a left group set there
is no natural notion of right amenability.

A transitive left group action ⊲ of G on M induces, for each element m0 ∈ M
and each family {gm0,m}m∈M of elements in G such that, for each point m ∈ M ,
we have gm0,m ⊲ m0 = m, a right quotient set semi-action P of G/G0 on M with
defect G0 given by m P gG0 = gm0,mgg−1
m0,m ⊲ m, where G0 is the stabiliser of
m0 under ⊲. Each of these right semi-actions is to the left group action what
right multiplication is to left group multiplication. They occur in the deﬁnition
of global transition functions of cellular automata over left homogeneous spaces
as deﬁned in [5]. A coordinate system is a choice of m0 and {gm0,m}m∈M .

A left homogeneous space is right amenable if there is a coordinate system
such that there is a ﬁnitely additive probability measure on P(M ) that is semi-
invariant under P. For example ﬁnite left homogeneous spaces, abelian groups,
and ﬁnitely right generated left homogeneous spaces of sub-exponential growth
are right amenable, in particular, quotients of ﬁnitely generated groups of sub-
exponential growth by ﬁnite subgroups acted on by left multiplication.

Right Amenable Left Group Sets and the Tarski-Følner Theorem

A net of non-empty and ﬁnite subsets of M is a right Følner net if, broadly
speaking, these subsets are asymptotically invariant under P. A ﬁnite subset
E of G/G0 and two partitions {Ae}e∈E and {Be}e∈E of M constitute a right
paradoxical decomposition if the map _ P e is injective on Ae and Be, and the
family {(Ae P e) ∪· (Be P e)}e∈E is a partition of M . The Tarski-Følner theorem
states that right amenability, the existence of right Følner nets, and the non-
existence of right paradoxical decompositions are equivalent.

The Tarski alternative theorem and the theorem of Følner, which consti-
tute the Tarski-Følner theorem, are famous theorems by Alfred Tarski and
Erling Følner from 1938 and 1955, see the papers ‘Algebraische Fassung des
Maßproblems’[3] and ‘On groups with full Banach mean value’[2]. This paper is
greatly inspired by the monograph ‘Cellular Automata and Groups’[1] by Tullio
Ceccherini-Silberstein and Michel Coornaert.

For a right amenable left homogeneous space with ﬁnite stabilisers we may
choose a right Følner net. Using this net we show in [6] that the Garden of Eden
theorem holds for such spaces. It states that a cellular automaton with ﬁnite set
of states and ﬁnite neighbourhood over such a space is surjective if and only if
it is pre-injective.

In Sect. 1 we introduce ﬁnitely additive probability measures and means, and
kind of right semi-actions on them. In Sect. 2 we introduce right amenability. In
Sect. 3 we introduce right Følner nets. In Sect. 4 we introduce right paradoxical
decompositions. In Sect. 5 we prove the Tarski alternative theorem and the
theorem of Følner. And in Sect. 6 we show under which assumptions left implies
right amenability and give two examples of right amenable left homogeneous
spaces.

Preliminary Notions. A left group set is a triple (M, G, ⊲), where M is a set,
G is a group, and ⊲ is a map from G × M to M , called left group action of G
on M , such that G → Sym(M ), g 7→ [g ⊲ _], is a group homomorphism. The
action ⊲ is transitive if M is non-empty and for each m ∈ M the map _ ⊲ m
is surjective; and free if for each m ∈ M the map _ ⊲ m is injective. For each
m ∈ M , the set G ⊲ m is the orbit of m, the set Gm = (_ ⊲ m)−1(m) is the
stabiliser of m, and, for each m′ ∈ M , the set Gm,m′ = (_ ⊲ m)−1(m′) is the
transporter of m to m′.

A left homogeneous space is a left group set M = (M, G, ⊲) such that ⊲ is
transitive. A coordinate system for M is a tuple K = (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M ), where
m0 ∈ M and, for each m ∈ M , we have gm0,m ⊲ m0 = m. The stabiliser Gm0 is
denoted by G0. The tuple R = (M, K) is a cell space. The set {gG0 | g ∈ G}
of left cosets of G0 in G is denoted by G/G0. The map P : M × G/G0 → M ,
(m, gG0) 7→ gm0,mg ⊲ m0 is a right semi-action of G/G0 on M with defect G0,
which means that

∀ m ∈ M ∀ g ∈ G ∃ g0 ∈ G0 : ∀ g

′ ∈ G/G0 : m P g · g

′ = (m P gG0) P g0 · g

′.

∀ m ∈ M : m P G0 = m,

It is transitive, which means that the set M is non-empty and for each m ∈ M
the map m P _ is surjective; and free, which means that for each m ∈ M the
map m P _ is injective; and semi-commutes with ⊲, which means that

∀ m ∈ M ∀ g ∈ G ∃ g0 ∈ G0 : ∀ g

′ ∈ G/G0 : (g ⊲ m) P g

′ = g ⊲ (m P g0 · g

′).

For each A ⊆ M , let 1A : M → {0, 1} be the indicator function of A.

1 Finitely Additive Probability Measures and Means

In this section, let R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )) be a cell space.

Deﬁnition 1. Let µ : P(M ) → [0, 1] be a map. It is called

1. normalised if and only if µ(M ) = 1;
2. ﬁnitely additive if and only if,

∀ A ⊆ M ∀ B ⊆ M :(cid:0)A ∩ B = ∅ =⇒ µ(A ∪ B) = µ(A) + µ(B)(cid:1);

3. ﬁnitely additive probability measure on M if and only if it is normalised and

ﬁnitely additive.

The set of all ﬁnitely additive probability measures on M is denoted by PM(M ).

Deﬁnition 2. The group G acts on [0, 1]P(M) on the left by

(cid:15) : G × [0, 1]P(M) → [0, 1]P(M),

(g, ϕ) 7→ [A 7→ ϕ(g−1 ⊲ A)],

such that G (cid:15) PM(M ) ⊆ PM(M ).

Deﬁnition 3. The quotient set G/G0 kind of semi-acts on [0, 1]P(M) on the
right by

(cid:15) : [0, 1]P(M) × G/G0 → [0, 1]P(M),

(ϕ, g) 7→ [A 7→ ϕ(A P g)].

Deﬁnition 4. Let ϕ be an element of [0, 1]P(M). It is called (cid:15)-semi-invariant if
and only if, for each element g ∈ G/G0 and each subset A of M such that the
map _ P g is injective on A, we have (ϕ (cid:15) g)(A) = ϕ(A).

Remark 1. Let R be the cell space ((G, G, ·), (eG, {g}g∈G)). Then, G0 = {eG}
and P = ·. Hence, (cid:15) : (ϕ, g) 7→ [A 7→ ϕ(A·g)]. Except for g not being inverted, this
is the right group action of G on PM(M ) as deﬁned in [1, Sect. 4.3, Paragraph 4].
Moreover, for each element g ∈ G, the map _ P g is injective. Hence, being (cid:15)-
semi-invariant is the same as being right-invariant as deﬁned in [1, Sect. 4.4,
Paragraph 2].

Deﬁnition 5. The vector space of bounded real-valued functions on M with
pointwise addition and scalar multiplication is denoted by ℓ∞(M ), the supremum
norm on ℓ∞(M ) is denoted by k_k∞, the topological dual space of ℓ∞(M ) is de-
noted by ℓ∞(M )∗, the pointwise partial order on ℓ∞(M ) is denoted by ≤, and
the constant function [m 7→ 0] is denoted by 0.

Deﬁnition 6. Let ν : ℓ∞(M ) → R be a map. It is called

1. normalised if and only if ν(1M ) = 1;
2. non-negativity preserving if and only if

∀ f ∈ ℓ∞(M ) : (f ≥ 0 =⇒ ν(f ) ≥ 0);

3. mean on M if and only if it is linear, normalised, and non-negativity pre-

serving.

The set of all means on M is denoted by M(M ).

Deﬁnition 7. Let Ψ be a map from ℓ∞(M ) to ℓ∞(M ). It is called non-negativity
preserving if and only if

∀ f ∈ ℓ∞(M ) : (f ≥ 0 =⇒ Ψ (f ) ≥ 0).

Lemma 1. Let G0 be ﬁnite, let A be a ﬁnite subset of M , and let g be an element
of G/G0. Then, |(_ P g)−1(A)| ≤ |G0| · |A|.

Proof. Let a ∈ A such that (_ P g)−1(a) 6= ∅. There are m and m′ ∈ M such
that Gm0,m = g and m′ P g = a. For each m′′ ∈ M , we have m′′ P g = gm0,m′′ ⊲ m
and hence

m′′ P g = a ⇐⇒ m′′ P g = m′ P g

⇐⇒ g−1
⇐⇒ g−1

m0,m′gm0,m′′ ⊲ m = m
m0,m′gm0,m′′ ∈ Gm
⇐⇒ gm0,m′′ ∈ gm0,m′Gm.

Moreover, for each m′′ and each m′′′ ∈ M with m′′ 6= m′′′, we have gm0,m′′
gm0,m′′′ . Thus,

6=

|(_ P g)−1(a)| = |{m′′ ∈ M | m′′ P g = a}|

= |{m′′ ∈ M | gm0,m′′ ∈ gm0,m′Gm}|
≤ |gm0,m′Gm|
= |Gm|
= |G0|.

Therefore, because (_ P g)−1(A) =Sa∈A(_ P g)−1(a), we have |(_ P g)−1(A)| ≤

|G0| · |A|.

Deﬁnition 8. The group G acts on ℓ∞(M ) on the left by

(cid:13) : G × ℓ∞(M ) → ℓ∞(M ),

(g, f ) 7→ [m 7→ f (g−1 ⊲ m)].

Lemma 2. Let G0 be ﬁnite. The quotient set G/G0 kind of semi-acts on ℓ∞(M )
on the right by

(cid:13) : ℓ∞(M ) × G/G0 → ℓ∞(M ),

(f, g) 7→ [m 7→ Xm′∈(_

Pg)−1(m)

f (m′)],

such that, for each tuple (f, g) ∈ ℓ∞(M )×G/G0, we have kf (cid:13)gk∞ ≤ |G0|·kf k∞.
Proof. Let g ∈ G/G0. Furthermore, let f ∈ ℓ∞(M ). Moreover, let m ∈ M .
Because G0 is ﬁnite, according to Lemma 1, we have |(_ P g)−1(m)| ≤ |G0| < ∞.
Hence, the sum in the deﬁnition of (cid:13) is ﬁnite. Furthermore,

|f (m′)|

|(f (cid:13) g)(m)| ≤ Xm′∈(_Pg)−1(m)
≤
 Xm′∈(_Pg)−1(m)

 · kf k∞

= |(_ P g)−1(m)| · kf k∞
≤ |G0| · kf k∞.

Therefore, f (cid:13) g ∈ ℓ∞(M ), kf (cid:13) gk∞ ≤ |G0| · kf k∞, and (cid:13) is well-deﬁned.

⊓⊔

Remark 2. In the situation of Remark 1, we have (cid:13) : (f, g) 7→ [m 7→ f (m ·
g−1)]. Hence, (cid:13) is the right group action of G on RG as deﬁned in [1, Sect. 4.3,
Paragraph 5].

Lemma 3. Let G0 be ﬁnite and let g be an element of G/G0. The map _ (cid:13) g is
linear, continuous, and non-negativity preserving.

Proof. Linearity follows from linearity of summation, continuity follows from
linearity and k_ (cid:13) gk∞ ≤ |G0| · k_k∞, and non-negativity preservation follows
⊓⊔
from non-negativity preservation of summation.

Lemma 4 ([1, Proposition 4.1.7]). Let ν be a mean on M . Then, ν ∈
ℓ∞(M )∗ and kνkℓ∞(M)∗ = 1. In particular, ν is continuous.

Deﬁnition 9. The group G acts on ℓ∞(M )∗ on the left by

(cid:13)(cid:15) : G × ℓ∞(M )∗ → ℓ∞(M )∗,

(g, ψ) 7→ [f 7→ ψ(g−1

(cid:13) f )],

such that G (cid:13)(cid:15) M(M ) ⊆ M(M ).

Deﬁnition 10. Let G0 be ﬁnite. The quotient set G/G0 kind of semi-acts on
ℓ∞(M )∗ on the right by

(cid:13)(cid:15) : ℓ∞(M )∗ × G/G0 → ℓ∞(M )∗,

(ψ, g) 7→ [f 7→ ψ(f (cid:13) g)].

Proof. Let ψ ∈ ℓ∞(M )∗ and let g ∈ G/G0. Then, ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g = ψ ◦ (_ (cid:13) g). Because
⊓⊔
ψ and _ (cid:13) g are linear and continuous, so is ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g.

Deﬁnition 11. Let G0 be ﬁnite and let ψ be an element of ℓ∞(M )∗. It is called
(cid:13)(cid:15) -invariant if and only if, for each element g ∈ G/G0 and each function f ∈
ℓ∞(M ), we have (ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g)(f ) = ψ(f ).

Remark 3. In the situation of Remark 2, we have (cid:13)(cid:15) : (ψ, g) 7→ [f 7→ ψ(f (cid:13) g].
Except for g not being inverted, this is the right group action of G on ℓ∞(G)∗
as deﬁned in [1, Sect. 4.3, Paragraph 6]. Hence, being (cid:13)(cid:15) -invariant is the same as
being right-invariant as deﬁned in [1, Sect. 4.4, Paragraph 3].

2 Right Amenability

In Deﬁnition 13 we introduce the notion of right amenability using ﬁnitely ad-
ditive probability measures. And in Theorem 3 we characterise right amenability
of cell spaces with ﬁnite stabilisers using means.

Deﬁnition 12. Let (M, G, ⊲) be a left group set. It is called left amenable if
and only if there is a (cid:15)-invariant ﬁnitely additive probability measure on M .

Deﬁnition 13. Let M = (M, G, ⊲) be a left homogeneous space. It is called
right amenable if and only if there is a coordinate system K = (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )
for M such that there is a (cid:15)-semi-invariant ﬁnitely additive probability measure
on M , in which case the cell space R = (M, K) is called right amenable.

Remark 4. In the situation of Remark 1, being right amenable is the same as
being amenable as deﬁned in [1, Deﬁnition 4.4.5].

In the remainder of this section, let R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )) be

a cell space such that the stabiliser G0 of m0 under ⊲ is ﬁnite.

Lemma 5. Let g be an element of G/G0 and let A be a subset of M such that
the map _ P g is injective on A. Then, 1APg = 1A (cid:13) g.

Proof. For each m ∈ M , because _ P g is injective on A,

1APg(m) =(1,

if m ∈ A P g,

0, otherwise,

= |{m′ ∈ A | m′ P g = m}|

1A(m′)

= Xm′∈(_Pg)−1(m)

= (1A (cid:13) g)(m).

In conclusion, 1APg = 1A (cid:13) g.

Lemma 6 ([1, Lemma 4.1.9]). The vector space

E(M ) = {f : M → R | f (M ) is ﬁnite} (= span{1A | A ⊆ M })

is dense in the Banach space (ℓ∞(M ), k_k∞).

⊓⊔

⊓⊔

Lemma 7. Let ψ be an element of ℓ∞(M )∗ such that, for each element g ∈ G/
G0 and each subset A of M such that the map _ P g is injective on A, we have
(ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g)(1A) = ψ(1A). The map ψ is (cid:13)(cid:15) -invariant.

Proof. Let g ∈ G/G0.

First, let A ⊆ M . Moreover, let m ∈ M . According to Lemma 1, we have
km = |(_ P g)−1(m)| ≤ |G0|. Hence, there are pairwise distinct mm,1, mm,2,
. . . , mm,km ∈ M such that (_ P g)−1(m) = {mm,1, mm,2, . . . , mm,km}. For each
i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , |G0|}, put

Ai = {mm,i | m ∈ M, km ≥ i} ∩ A.

Thus, because ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g and ψ are linear,

Because, for each m ∈ M and each m′ ∈ M such that m 6= m′, we have
(_ P g)−1(m) ∩ (_ P g)−1(m′) = ∅, the sets A1, A2, . . . , A|G0| are pairwise
disjoint and the map _ P g is injective on each of these sets. Moreover, because
1Ai.

i=1 Ai = A. Therefore, 1A = P|G0|
Sm∈M (_ P g)−1(m) = M , we have S|G0|
(ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g)(1A) = (ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g)
Xi=1


1Ai
 =

|G0|

Xi=1

(ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g)(1Ai) =

ψ(1Ai ) = ψ(1A).

Therefore, ψ(cid:13)(cid:15) g = ψ on the set of indicator functions. Thus, because the indicator
functions span E(M ), and ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g and ψ are linear, ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g = ψ on E(M ). Hence,
because E(M ) is dense in ℓ∞(M ), and ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g and ψ are continuous, ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g = ψ on
ℓ∞(M ). In conclusion, ψ is (cid:13)(cid:15) -invariant.

Right Amenable Left Group Sets and the Tarski-Følner Theorem

Theorem 3. The cell space R is right amenable if and only if there is a (cid:13)(cid:15) -
invariant mean on M .

Proof. Let Φ be the map in Theorem 1.

First, let R be right amenable. Then, there is (cid:15)-semi-invariant ﬁnitely addit-
ive probability measure µ on M . Put ν = Φ−1(µ). Then, for each g ∈ G/G0 and
each A ⊆ M such that _ P g is injective on A, according to Lemma 5,

(ν (cid:13)(cid:15) g)(1A) = ν(1A (cid:13) g) = ν(1APg) = µ(A P g) = µ(A) = ν(1A).

Thus, according to Lemma 7, the mean ν is (cid:13)(cid:15) -invariant.

Secondly, let there be a (cid:13)(cid:15) -invariant mean ν on M . Put µ = Φ(ν). Then, for
each g ∈ G/G0 and each A ⊆ M such that _ P g is injective on A, according to
Lemma 5,

(µ (cid:15) g)(A) = µ(A P g) = ν(1APg) = ν(1A (cid:13) g) = ν(1A) = µ(A).

Hence, µ is (cid:15)-semi-invariant.

⊓⊔

3 Right Følner Nets

In this section, let R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )) be a cell space.

Deﬁnition 14. Let {Fi}i∈I be a net in {F ⊆ M | F 6= ∅, F ﬁnite} indexed by
(I, ≤). It is called right Følner net in R indexed by (I, ≤) if and only if

∀ g ∈ G/G0 : lim
i∈I

|Fi r (_ P g)−1(Fi)|

|Fi|

= 0.

Remark 5. In the situation of Remark 1, for each element g ∈ G and each index
i ∈ I, we have (_ P g)−1(Fi) = Fi · g−1. Hence, right Følner nets in R are exactly
right Følner nets for G as deﬁned in [1, First paragraph after Deﬁnition 4.7.2].

Lemma 8. Let V be a set, let W be a set, and let Ψ be a map from V × W to
R. There is a net {vi}i∈I in V indexed by (I, ≤) such that

∀ w ∈ W : lim
i∈I

Ψ (vi, w) = 0,

(1)

if and only if, for each ﬁnite subset Q of W and each positive real number
ε ∈ R>0, there is an element v ∈ V such that

∀ q ∈ Q : Ψ (v, q) < ε.

(2)

Proof. First, let there be a net {vi}i∈I in V indexed by (I, ≤) such that (1)
holds. Furthermore, let Q ⊆ W be ﬁnite and let ε ∈ R>0. Because (1) holds, for
each q ∈ Q, there is an iq ∈ I such that,

∀ i ∈ I : (i ≥ iq =⇒ Ψ (vi, q) < ε).

Right Amenable Left Group Sets and the Tarski-Følner Theorem

9

Because (I, ≤) is a directed set and Q is ﬁnite, there is an i ∈ I such that, for
each q ∈ Q, we have i ≥ iq. Put v = vi. Then, (2) holds.

Secondly, for each ﬁnite Q ⊆ W and each ε ∈ R>0, let there be a v ∈ V such

that (2) holds. Furthermore, let

I = {Q ⊆ W | Q is ﬁnite} × R>0

and let ≤ be the preorder on I given by

∀(Q, ε) ∈ I ∀(Q′, ε′) ∈ I : (Q, ε) ≤ (Q′, ε′) ⇐⇒ Q ⊆ Q′ ∧ ε ≥ ε′.

For each (Q, ε) ∈ I and each (Q′, ε′) ∈ I, the element (Q ∪ Q′, min(ε, ε′)) of I is
an upper bound of (Q, ε) and of (Q′, ε′). Hence, (I, ≤) is a directed set.
By precondition, for each i = (Q, ε) ∈ I, there is a vi ∈ V such that

∀ q ∈ Q : Ψ (vi, q) < ε.

Let w ∈ W and let ε0 ∈ R>0. Put i0 = ({w}, ε0). For each i = (Q, ε) ∈ I with
i ≥ i0, we have w ∈ Q and ε ≤ ε0. Hence,

∀ i ∈ I : (i ≥ i0 =⇒ Ψ (vi, w) < ε0).

Therefore, {vi}i∈I is a net in V indexed by (I, ≤) such that (1) holds.

⊓⊔

Lemma 9. There is a right Følner net in R if and only if, for each ﬁnite subset
E of G/G0 and each positive real number ε ∈ R>0, there is a non-empty and
ﬁnite subset F of M such that

∀ e ∈ E :

|F r (_ P e)−1(F )|

|F |

< ε.

Proof. This is a direct consequence of Lemma 8 with

Ψ : {F ⊆ M | F 6= ∅, F ﬁnite} × G/G0 → R,

(F, g) 7→

|F r (_ P g)−1(F )|

⊓⊔

Lemma 10. Let m be an element of M , and let g be an element of G/G0. There
is an element g ∈ g such that

∀ g

′ ∈ G/G0 : (m P g) P g

′ = m P g · g

′.

Proof. There is a g ∈ G such that gG0 = g. Moreover, because P is a semi-action
with defect G0, there is a g0 ∈ G0 such that

∀ g

′ ∈ G/G0 : (m P gG0) P g

4 Right Paradoxical Decompositions

In this section, let R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )) be a cell space.

Deﬁnition 15. Let A and A′ be two sets. The set A ∪ A′ is denoted by A ∪· A′
if and only if the sets A and A′ are disjoint.

Deﬁnition 16. Let E be a ﬁnite subset of G/G0, and let {Ae}e∈E and {Be}e∈E
be two families of subsets of M indexed by E such that, for each index e ∈ E,
the map _ P e is injective on Ae and on Be, and

The triple (N, {Ae}e∈E, {Be}e∈E) is called right paradoxical decomposition of

Remark 6. In the situation of Remark 1, for each element g ∈ G, the map _ P g
is injective. Hence, right paradoxical decompositions of R are the same as right
paradoxical decompositions of G as deﬁned in [1, Deﬁnition 4.8.1].

5 Tarski’s and Følner’s Theorem

In this section, let R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )) be a cell space such that
the stabiliser G0 of m0 under ⊲ is ﬁnite.

Lemma 16. Let g be an element of G/G0. The map _ (cid:13)(cid:15) g is continuous, where
ℓ∞(M )∗ is equipped with the weak-∗ topology.

Proof. For each f ∈ ℓ∞(M ), let evf : ℓ∞(M )∗ → R, ψ 7→ ψ(f ). Furthermore, let
f ∈ ℓ∞(M ). Then, for each ψ ∈ ℓ∞(M )∗,

(evf ◦(_ (cid:13)(cid:15) g))(ψ) = evf (ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g) = (ψ (cid:13)(cid:15) g)(f ) = ψ(f (cid:13) g) = evf (cid:13)g(ψ).

Thus, evf ◦(_(cid:13)(cid:15) g) = evf (cid:13)g. Hence, because evf (cid:13)g is continuous, so is evf ◦(_(cid:13)(cid:15) g).
⊓⊔
Therefore, the map _ (cid:13)(cid:15) g is continuous.

Lemma 17. Let {νi}i∈I be a net in M(M ) such that, for each element g ∈ G/
G0, the net {(νi (cid:13)(cid:15) g) − νi}i∈I converges to 0 in ℓ∞(M )∗ equipped with the weak-∗
topology. The cell space R is right amenable.

Proof. Let g ∈ G/G0. According to Theorem 2, the set M(M ) is compact in
ℓ∞(M )∗ equipped with the weak-∗ topology. Hence, there is a subnet {νij }j∈J
of {νi}i∈I that converges to a ν ∈ M(M ). Because, according to Lemma 16, the
map _ (cid:13)(cid:15) g is continuous, the net {(νij (cid:13)(cid:15) g) − νij }j∈J converges to (ν (cid:13)(cid:15) g) − ν
in ℓ∞(M )∗. Because it is a subnet of {(νi (cid:13)(cid:15) g) − νi}i∈I , it also converges to 0 in
ℓ∞(M )∗. Because the space ℓ∞(M )∗ is Hausdorﬀ, we have (ν (cid:13)(cid:15) g) − ν = 0 and
hence ν (cid:13)(cid:15) g = ν. Altogether, ν is a (cid:13)(cid:15) -invariant mean. In conclusion, according
to Theorem 3, the cell space R is right amenable.
⊓⊔

Lemma 18. Let m be an element of M , and let E and E′ be two subsets of
G/G0. There is a subset E′′ of G/G0 such that (m P E) P E′ = m P E′′; if
G0 ∈ E ∩ E′, then G0 ∈ E′′; if E and E′ are ﬁnite, then |E′′| ≤ |E| · |E′|; and
if G0 · E′ ⊆ E′, then E′′ = {g · e′ | e ∈ E, e′ ∈ E′, g ∈ e}.

Proof. For each e ∈ E, according to Lemma 10, there is a ge ∈ e such that

∀ g ∈ G/G0 : (m P e) P g = m P ge · g.

Put E′′ = {ge · e′ | e ∈ E, e′ ∈ E′}. Then, (m P E) P E′ = m P E′′. Moreover, if
G0 ∈ E∩E′, then G0 = gG0 ·G0 ∈ E′′; if E and E′ are ﬁnite, then |E′′| ≤ |E|·|E′|;
and if G0 · E′ ⊆ E′, then E′′ is as stated.

Main Theorem 4. Let R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )) be a cell space
such that the stabiliser G0 of m0 under ⊲ is ﬁnite. The following statements
are equivalent:

1. The cell space R is not right amenable;
2. There is no right Følner net in R;
3. There is a ﬁnite subset E of G/G0 such that G0 ∈ E and, for each ﬁnite

subset F of M , we have |F P E| ≥ 2|F |;

4. There is a 2-to-1 surjective map φ : M → M and there is a ﬁnite subset E

of G/G0 such that

∀ m ∈ M ∃ e ∈ E : φ(m) P e = m;

5. There is a right paradoxical decomposition of R.

let i ∈ I. Put

Right Amenable Left Group Sets and the Tarski-Følner Theorem

According to Deﬁnition 14 and Lemma 13, the nets {|(_Pg)−1(Fi)rFi|/|Fi|}i∈I
and {|Fi r (_ P g)−1(Fi)|/|Fi|}i∈I converge to 0. Hence, so does {|(νi (cid:13)(cid:15) g −
νi)(f )|}i∈I . Thus, the net {νi (cid:13)(cid:15) g− νi}i∈I converges to 0 in ℓ∞(M )∗ equipped
with the weak-∗ topology. Hence, according to Lemma 17, the cell space R is
right amenable. In conclusion, by contraposition, if R is not right amenable,
then there is no right Følner net in R.

2 implies 3. Let there be no right Følner net in R. According to Lemma 9,
there is a ﬁnite E1 ⊆ G/G0 and an ε ∈ R>0 such that, for each non-empty
and ﬁnite F ⊆ M , there is an eF ∈ E1 such that

|F r (_ P eF )−1(F )|

|F |

≥ ε.

Put E2 = {G0} ∪ E1.
Let F ⊆ M be non-empty and ﬁnite. Then, F ⊆ F ∪ (F P E1) = F P E2.
Thus,

|F P E2| − |F | = |(F P E2) r F |
= |(F P E1) r F |
≥ |(F P eF ) r F |.

Moreover, according to Lemma 1, we have |(_ P eF )−1((F P eF ) r F )| ≤
|G0| · |(F P eF ) r F |. Hence,

|F P E2| − |F | ≥

|(_ P eF )−1((F P eF ) r F )|

|G0|

.

Therefore, because F r (_ P eF )−1(F ) ⊆ (_ P eF )−1((F P eF ) r F ),

|F P E2| − |F | ≥

|F r (_ P eF )−1(F )|

|G0|

|F |.

Put ξ = 1 + ε/|G0|. Then, |F P E2| ≥ ξ|F |. Because ε does not depend on
F , neither does ξ. Therefore, for each non-empty and ﬁnite F ⊆ M , we have
|F P E2| ≥ ξ|F |.
Let F ⊆ M be non-empty and ﬁnite. Because ξ > 1, there is an n ∈ N such
that ξn ≥ 2. Hence,

|(((F P E2) P · · · ) P E2) P E2

| ≥ ξ|((F P E2) P · · · ) P E2|

Moreover, according to Lemma 18, there is an E ⊆ G/G0 such that E is

|F P E| ≥ 2|F |.

ﬁnite F ⊆ M , we have |F P E| ≥ 2|F |. Furthermore, let G be the bipartite
graph

(M, M, {(m, m′) ∈ M × M | ∃ e ∈ E : m P e = m′}).

Moreover, let F ⊆ M be ﬁnite. The right neighbourhood of F in G is

Nr(F ) = {m′ ∈ M | ∃ e ∈ E : F P e ∋ m′} = F P E

and the left neighbourhood of F in G is

Nl(F ) = {m ∈ M | ∃ e ∈ E : m P e ∈ F } = [e∈E

(_ P e)−1(F ).

By precondition |Nr(F )| = |F P E| ≥ 2|F |. Moreover, because G0 ∈ E,
we have F = (_ P G0)−1(F ) ⊆ Nl(F ) and hence |Nl(F )| ≥ |F | ≥ 2−1|F |.
Therefore, according to the Hall harem theorem, there is a perfect (1, 2)-
matching for G. In conclusion, there is a 2-to-1 surjective map φ : M → M

that m P e = ψ(m) and m P e′ = ψ′(m), in other words, m ∈ Ae and m ∈ Be′ ;
as depicted in the right columns with solid and dashed borders, the families
{Ae}e∈E and {Be′ }e′ ∈E are partitions of M ; as depicted in the left column, the

is a partition of ψ(M ), and the family {ψ′(Be′ )}e′ ∈E = {Be′ P e′}e′∈E is a
partition of ψ′(M ).

such that, for each m ∈ M , we have (φ(m), m) ∈ E, that is, there is an
e ∈ E such that φ(m) P e = m.

and a ﬁnite subset E of G/G0 such that

∀ m ∈ M ∃ e ∈ E : φ(m) P e = m.

By the axiom of choice, there are two injective maps ψ and ψ′ : M → M
such that, for each m ∈ M , we have φ−1(m) = {ψ(m), ψ′(m)}. For each
e ∈ E, let

Ae = {m ∈ M | m P e = ψ(m)}

and Be = {m ∈ M | m P e = ψ′(m)}.

Right Amenable Left Group Sets and the Tarski-Følner Theorem

17

Let m ∈ M . There is an e ∈ E such that φ(ψ(m)) P e = ψ(m). Because
φ(ψ(m)) = m, we have m ∈ Ae. And, because P is free, for each e′ ∈ E r{e},
we have m P e′ 6= m P e = ψ(m) and thus m /∈ Ae′ . Therefore,

M = [·

and analogously M = [·

(N, {Ae}e∈E, {Be}e∈E) is a right paradoxical decomposition of R.

Suppose that R is right amenable. Then, according to Theorem 3, there is

Right Amenable Left Group Sets and the Tarski-Følner Theorem

6 From Left to Right Amenability

Lemma 19. Let R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )) be a cell space and let H
be a subgroup of G such that, for each element g ∈ G/G0, there is an element
h ∈ H such that the maps _ P g and h ⊲ _ are inverse to each other. If (M, H,
⊲↾H×M ) is left amenable, then R is right amenable.

Proof. Let µ ∈ PM(M ). Furthermore, let g ∈ G/G0. There is an h ∈ H such
that _ P g and h ⊲ _ are inverse to each other. Moreover, let A ⊆ M . Because
_ P g = (h ⊲ _)−1 = h−1 ⊲ _, we have A P g = h−1 ⊲ A. Therefore,

(µ (cid:15) g)(A) = µ(A P g)

= µ(h−1 ⊲ A)
= (h (cid:15) µ)(A).

Thus, µ (cid:15) g = h (cid:15) µ. Hence, if µ is (cid:15)↾H×[0,1]P(M ) -invariant, then µ is (cid:15)-semi-
invariant. In conclusion, if (M, H, ⊲↾H×M ) is left amenable, then R is right
⊓⊔
amenable.

Lemma 20. Let R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )) be a cell space and let H
be a subgroup of G such that G = G0H, for each element g ∈ G/G0, the map
_ P g is injective,

∀ h ∈ H : _ P hG0 = h ⊲ _,

and

∀ h ∈ H ∀ g ∈ G/G0 : (_ P hG0) P g = _ P h · g.

If (M, H, ⊲↾H×M ) is left amenable, then R is right amenable.
Proof. Let gG0 ∈ G/G0. Because g−1 ∈ G = G0H, there is a g0 ∈ G0 and there
is an h ∈ H such that g−1 = g0h. Thus, h = g−1
0 g−1 ∈ H. Hence, for each
m ∈ M ,

((_ P gG0) ◦ (h ⊲ _))(m) = (h ⊲ m) P gG0

= (m P hG0) P gG0
= m P hgG0
= m P g−1
= m P G0
= m.

0 g−1gG0

Therefore, h⊲ _ is right inverse to _ PgG0. Hence, _ PgG0 is surjective and thus,
because it is injective by precondition, bijective. Therefore, _ PgG0 and h⊲_ are
inverse to each other. In conclusion, according to Lemma 19, if (M, H, ⊲↾H×M )
is left amenable, then R is right amenable.
⊓⊔

Deﬁnition 17. Let G be a group. The set

Z(G) = {z ∈ G | ∀ g ∈ G : zg = gz}

is called centre of G.

Lemma 21. Let G be a group. The centre of G is a subgroup of G.

⊓⊔

Lemma 22. Let R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )) be a cell space and let H
be a subgroup of G such that G is equal to G0H, ⊲↾H×M is free, and {gm0,m}m∈M
is included in Z(H). If (M, H, ⊲↾H×M ) is left amenable, then R is right amen-
able.

Proof. Let g ∈ G. For each m ∈ M ,

m P gG0 = gm0,mg ⊲ m0 = gm0,m ⊲ (g ⊲ m0).

Let m ∈ M . For each m′ ∈ M , because ⊲↾Z(H)×M is free and gm0,m, gm0,m′ ∈
Z(H),

m′ P gG0 = m P gG0 ⇐⇒ gm0,m′ = gm0,m

⇐⇒ m′ = m.

Therefore, _ P gG0 is injective.

Let m ∈ M and let h ∈ H. Because gm0,m ∈ Z(G),

m P hG0 = gm0,mh ⊲ m0
= hgm0,m ⊲ m0
= h ⊲ m.

Put m′ = m P hG0. Then,

gm0,mh ⊲ m0 = hgm0,m ⊲ m0

= h ⊲ m
= m′.

Hence, because gm0,m′ ⊲ m0 = m′ also and ⊲↾H×M is free, gm0,m′ = gm0,mh.
Therefore,

(m P hG0) P gG0 = m′ P gG0

= gm0,m′g ⊲ m0
= gm0,mhg ⊲ m0
= m P hgG0.

In conclusion, according to Lemma 20, if (M, H, ⊲↾H×M ) is left amenable, then
R is right amenable.

let

H = {f : M → M, x 7→ x + b | b ∈ M }

20

Right Amenable Left Group Sets and the Tarski-Følner Theorem

be the group of translations also with composition as group multiplication. The
group H is an abelian subgroup of G, which in turn is a non-abelian subgroup
of the symmetry group of M . Moreover, according to [1, Example 4.6.2 and
Theorem 4.6.3], the group G is left amenable and hence, according to [1, Pro-
position 4.5.1], so is its subgroup H. Furthermore, the group G acts transitively
on M by function application by ⊲ and so does H by ⊲↾H×M , even freely so. Be-
cause the groups G and H are left amenable, so are the left group sets (M, G, ⊲)
and (M, H, ⊲↾H×M ). The stabiliser of m0 = 0 is the group of dilations

G0 = {f : M → M, x 7→ ax | a ∈ M r {0}}.

We have G = G0H. For each m ∈ M , let

gm0,m : M → M,

be the translation by m. Then, {gm0,m}m∈M is included in Z(H) = H. Hence,
according to Lemma 22, the cell space R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {gm0,m}m∈M )) is
right amenable.

Lemma 23. Let H and N be two groups, let φ : H → Aut(N ) be a group ho-
momorphism, let G be the Cartesian product H × N , and let

· : G × G → G,

((h, n), (h′, n′)) 7→ (hh′, nφ(h)(n′)).

The tuple (G, ·) is a group, called semi-direct product of H and N with respect
⊓⊔
to φ, and denoted by H ⋉φ N .

Lemma 24. Let G be a semi-direct product of H and N with respect to φ. The
neutral element of G is (eH , eN ) and, for each element (h, n) ∈ G, the inverse
of (h, n) is (h−1, φ(h−1)(n)).
⊓⊔

Deﬁnition 18. Let (M, G, ⊲) be a left homogeneous space. It is called principal
if and only if the action ⊲ is free.

Lemma 25. Let (M, H, ⊲H) be a principal
left homogeneous space. Further-
more, let G0 be a group, let φ : G0 → Aut(H) be a group homomorphism, let
m0 be an element of M , for each element m ∈ M , let hm0,m be the unique
element of H such that hm0,m ⊲ m0 = m, and let

⊲G0 : G0 × M → M,

(g0, m) 7→ φ(g0)(hm0,m) ⊲H m0.

Moreover, let G be the semi-direct product of G0 and H with respect to φ, and
let

⊲ : G × M → M,

Right Amenable Left Group Sets and the Tarski-Følner Theorem

21

((g0, h), m) 7→ h ⊲H (g0 ⊲G0 m).

The triple (M, G0, ⊲G0) is a left group set and the group G0 is the stabiliser of m0
under ⊲G0. Furthermore, the tuple R = ((M, G, ⊲), (m0, {(eG0, hm0,m)}m∈M )) is
a cell space and the group G0 × {eH } is the stabiliser of m0 under ⊲. Moreover,
under the identiﬁcation of G0 with G0 × {eH} and of H with {eG0} × H, the left
group sets (M, G0, ⊲G0) and (M, H, ⊲H ) are left group subsets of (M, G, ⊲).

Proof. Because φ(eG0) = idAut(H), for each m ∈ M ,

eG0 ⊲G0 m = φ(eG0 )(hm0,m) ⊲H m0

= hm0,m ⊲H m0
= m.

Let g0 and g′
m0 = φ(g′
fore,

0 ∈ G0, and let m ∈ M . Because ⊲H is free and hm0,φ(g′

0)(hm0,m)⊲H m0, we have hm0,φ(g′

0)(hm0 ,m)⊲H m0 = φ(g′

0)(hm0 ,m)⊲H m0 ⊲H
0)(hm0,m). There-

g0g′

0 ⊲G0 m = φ(g0g′

= (φ(g0) ◦ φ(g′
= φ(g0)(φ(g′

= g0 ⊲G0 (φ(g′

0 ⊲G0 m).

0))(hm0,m) ⊲H m0

0)(hm0,m)) ⊲H m0

0)(hm0 ,m)⊲H m0 ) ⊲H m0

0)(hm0,m) ⊲H m0)

In conclusion, (M, G0, ⊲G0) is a left group set.

Because hm0,m0 = eH , for each g0 ∈ G0,

g0 ⊲G0 m0 = φ(g0)(eH ) ⊲H m0

= eH ⊲H m0
= m0.

In conclusion, G0 is the stabiliser of m0 under ⊲G0.

For each m ∈ M ,

(eG0, eH) ⊲ m = eH ⊲H (eG0 ⊲G0 m) = m.

Let g0 ∈ G0, let h ∈ H, and let m ∈ M . Because hhm0,m ⊲H m0 = h ⊲H m, we
have hhm0,m = hm0,h⊲H m. Hence,

φ(g0)(h) ⊲H (g0 ⊲G0 m) = φ(g0)(h) ⊲H (φ(g0)(hm0,m) ⊲H m0)

= φ(g0)(h)φ(g0)(hm0,m) ⊲H m0
= φ(g0)(hhm0,m) ⊲H m0
= φ(g0)(hm0,h⊲H m) ⊲H m0
= g0 ⊲G0 (h ⊲H m).

Therefore, for each g0 ∈ G0, each g′
m ∈ M ,

0 ∈ G0, each h ∈ H, each h′ ∈ H, and each

(g0, h)(g′

0, h′) ⊲ m = (g0g′

= (g0, h) ⊲(cid:0)h′ ⊲H (g′
0, h′) ⊲ m(cid:1).
= (g0, h) ⊲(cid:0)(g′

In conclusion, (M, G, ⊲) is a left group action.

Because ⊲H is transitive and, for each h ∈ H and each m ∈ M , we have
(eG0, h) ⊲ m = h ⊲ m, the left group action ⊲ is transitive and hence M = (M,
G, ⊲) is a left homogeneous space. Moreover, because, for each m ∈ M ,

(eG0 , hm0,m) ⊲ m0 = hm0,m ⊲H (eG0 ⊲G0 m0)

= hm0,m ⊲H m0
= m,

the tuple K = (m0, {(eG0, hm0,m)}m∈M ) is a coordinate system for M. There-
fore, R = (M, K) is a cell space.

Because G0 is the stabiliser of m0 under ⊲G0, for each (g0, h) ∈ G, we have
(g0, h) ⊲ m0 = h ⊲H (g0 ⊲ m0) = h ⊲ m0. Because ⊲H is free, G0 × {eH} is the
stabiliser of m0 under ⊲.

Under the identiﬁcation of G0 with G0 × {eH } and of H with {eG0} × H, we
⊓⊔

have ⊲↾G0×M = ⊲G0 and ⊲↾H×M = ⊲H.

Corollary 3. In the situation of Lemma 25, let H be abelian. The cell space R
is right amenable.

Proof. According to [1, Theorem 4.6.1], because H is abelian, it is left amenable.
Therefore, (M, H, ⊲H ) is left amenable. Identify G0 with G0 × {eH} and identify
H with {eG0}×H. Then, H is a subgroup of G, and G = G0H, and ⊲↾H×M = ⊲H
is free, and, for each m ∈ M , we have (eG0, hm0,m) ∈ H = Z(H). Hence,
according to Lemma 22, the cell space R is right amenable.
⊓⊔

Example 2. Let d be a positive integer; let E be the d-dimensional Euclidean
group, that is, the symmetry group of the d-dimensional Euclidean space, in
other words, the isometries of Rd with respect to the Euclidean metric with
function composition; let T be the d-dimensional translation group; and let O be
the d-dimensional orthogonal group. The group T is abelian, a normal subgroup
of E, and isomorphic to Rd with addition; the group O is isomorphic to the
quotient E/T and to the (d × d)-dimensional orthogonal matrices with matrix
multiplication; the group E is isomorphic to the semi-direct product O ⋉ι T ,

where ι : O → Aut(Rd) is the inclusion map. The groups T , O, and E act on Rd
on the left by function application, denoted by ⊲T , ⊲O, and ⊲, respectively; under
the identiﬁcation of T with Rd by t 7→ [v 7→ v + t], of O with the orthogonal
matrices of Rd×d by A 7→ [v 7→ Av], and of E with O ⋉ι T by (A, t) 7→ [v 7→
Av + t], we have

⊲T : T × Rd → Rd,

(t, v) 7→ v + t,

⊲O : O × Rd → Rd,
(A, v) 7→ Av,

⊲ : E × Rd → Rd,
((A, t), v) 7→ Av + t,

ι : O → Aut(Rd),
A 7→ [v 7→ Av].

Hence, for each vector v ∈ Rd, we have v ⊲T 0 = v, therefore, ⊲O = [(A, v) 7→
ι(A)(v) ⊲T 0], and thus ⊲ = [((A, t), v) 7→ t ⊲T (A ⊲O v)]. Moreover, because
the group (T, ◦) ∼= (Rd, +) is abelian, according to [1, Theorem 4.6.1], it is
left amenable and so is (Rd, Rd, +) ∼= (Rd, T, ⊲). In conclusion, according to
Corollary 3, the cell space ((Rd, E, ⊲), (0, {−v}v∈Rd )) is right amenable.

A Topologies

The theory of topologies and nets as presented here may be found in more detail
in Appendix A in the monograph ‘Cellular Automata and Groups’[1].

Deﬁnition 19. Let X be a set and let T be a set of subsets of X. The set T is
called topology on X if, and only if

1. {∅, X} is a subset of T ,

of T ,

2. for each family {Oi}i∈I of elements in T , the union Si∈I Oi is an element
3. for each ﬁnite family {Oi}i∈I of elements in T , the intersection Ti∈I Oi is

an element of T .

Deﬁnition 20. Let X be a set, and let T and T ′ be two topologies on X. The
topology T is called

1. coarser than T ′ if, and only if T ⊆ T ′;
2. ﬁner than T ′ if, and only if T ⊇ T ′.

Deﬁnition 21. Let X be a set and let T be a topology on X. The tuple (X, T )
is called topological space, each subset O of X with O ∈ T is called open in X,
each subset A of X with X r A ∈ T is called closed in X, and each subset U of
X that is both open and closed is called clopen in X.

The set X is said to be equipped with T if, and only if it shall be implicitly
clear that T is the topology on X being considered. The set X is called topological
space if, and only if it is implicitly clear what topology on X is being considered.

Example 3. Let X be a set. The set P(X) is the ﬁnest topology on X. Itself as
well as the topological space (X, P(X)) are called discrete.

Deﬁnition 22. Let (X, T ) be a topological space, let x be a point of X, and let
N be a subset of X. The set N is called neighbourhood of x if, and only if there
is an open subset O of X such that x ∈ O and O ⊆ N .

Deﬁnition 23. Let (X, T ) be a topological space and let x be a point of X. The
set of all open neighbourhoods of x is denoted by Tx.

where, for each index i ∈ I, mi = f (i).

Deﬁnition 28. Let I be a set, let ≤ be a binary relation on I, and let {mi}i∈I

j}j∈J = {mf (j)}j∈J and

∀ i ∈ I ∃ j ∈ J : ∀ j′ ∈ J : (j′ ≥ j =⇒ f (j′) ≥ i).

Deﬁnition 30. Let (X, T ) be a topological space, let {xi}i∈I be a net in X
indexed by (I, ≤), and let x be a point of X. The net {xi}i∈I is said to converge
to x and x is called limit point of {xi}i∈I if, and only if

∀ O ∈ Tx ∃ i0 ∈ I : ∀ i ∈ I : (i ≥ i0 =⇒ xi ∈ O).

Deﬁnition 31. Let (X, T ) be a topological space and let {xi}i∈I be a net in X
indexed by (I, ≤). The net {xi}i∈I is called convergent if, and only if there is a

subset A of X, the set Nr(A) is ﬁnite; and, for each ﬁnite subset B of Y , the set
Nl(B) is ﬁnite.

Deﬁnition 52. Let (X, Y, E) be a bipartite graph and let M be a subset of E.

Right Amenable Left Group Sets and the Tarski-Følner Theorem

Deﬁnition 55. Let X and Y be two sets, and let f be a surjective map from X
to Y . The map f is called k-to-1 if, and only if,

∀ y ∈ Y : |f −1(y)| = k.

Deﬁnition 56. Let (X, Y, E) be a bipartite graph, let k be a positive integer,
and let M be a subset of E. The set M is called perfect (1, k)-matching if, and
only if,

∀ x ∈ X : |{y ∈ Y | (x, y) ∈ E}| = k

and

∀ y ∈ Y : |{x ∈ X | (x, y) ∈ E}| = 1.

Remark 11. The set M is a perfect (1, k)-matching if, and only if, there is a
k-to-1 surjective map ψ : Y → X such, that {(ψ(y), y) | y ∈ Y } = M .

Remark 12. The set M is a perfect (1, 1)-matching if, and only if, it is a perfect
matching.

Deﬁnition 57. Let (X, Y, E) be a locally ﬁnite bipartite graph and let k be a
positive integer. The graph (X, Y, E) is said to satisfy the Hall k-harem condi-
tions if, and only if, for each ﬁnite subset A of X, we have |Nr(A)| ≥ k|A|, and
for each ﬁnite subset B of Y , we have |Nl(B)| ≥ k−1|B|.

Theorem 11 (Hall’s harem theorem, Philip Hall). Let (X, Y, E) be a loc-
ally ﬁnite bipartite graph and let k be a positive integer. The graph (X, Y, E)
satisﬁes the Hall k-harem conditions if, and only if, there is a perfect (1, k)-
matching.

Proof. See Theorem H.4.2 in ‘Cellular Automata and Groups’[1].

G Zorn’s Lemma

Deﬁnition 58. Let ≤ be a preorder on I. It is called partial order on I and the
preordered set (I, ≤) is called partially ordered set if, and only if the relation ≤
is antisymmetric.

Deﬁnition 59. Let ≤ be a partial order on I. It is called total order on I and
the partially ordered set (I, ≤) is called totally ordered set if, and only if the
relation ≤ is total.

Deﬁnition 60. Let ≤ be a preorder on I and let i be an element of I. The
element i is called maximal in (I, ≤) if, and only if

∀ i′ ∈ I : (i′ ≥ i =⇒ i′ ≤ i).

Deﬁnition 61. Let ≤ be a preorder on I and let J be a subset of I. The set J
is called chain in (I, ≤) if, and only if the restriction of ≤ to J is a total order
on J.

Lemma 40 (Zorn’s Lemma). Let (I, ≤) be a preordered set such that each
⊓⊔
chain in I has an upper bound. Then, I has a maximal element.
