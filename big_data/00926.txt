SMALL GENERATORS OF COCOMPACT ARITHMETIC

FUCHSIAN GROUPS

MICHELLE CHU AND HAN LI

Abstract. In the study of Fuchsian groups, it is a nontrivial problem to
determine a set of generators. Using a dynamical approach we construct for
any cocompact arithmetic Fuchsian group a fundamental region in SL2(R)
from which we determine a set of small generators.

1. Introduction

Arithmetic Fuchsian groups form a subclass of Fuchsian groups with a special
connection to number theory and the theory of automorphic forms. These groups
are necesarily of ﬁnite covolume and thus ﬁnitely generated. However, as with
general Fuchsian groups, it is a nontrivial problem to determine a set of generators.
One way to do this involves constructing a polygonal fundamental domain in H2
and listing a set of generators corresponding to the side pairings of the polygon.
Johansson, Voight and Macasieb produced algorithms to determine fundamental
domains for some subclasses of arithmetic Fuchsian groups (see [6, 16, 11]).

We also note that Chinburg and Stover [4] obtain bounds for small generators
S-units of division algebras using lattice point methods. However, their generators
are small in the division algebra and their representatives in GLn do not neccesarily
have small entries.

In this paper, we consider any cocompact arithmetic Fuchsian group and use
dynamical techniques to construct a fundamental region in SL2(R) from which we
determine a set of small generators. Our methods are reminiscent of methods used
by Burger and Schroeder in [3].

1.1. Statement of Results. Let G = SL2(R) with a ﬁxed Haar measure µ, and
Γ be a cocompact arithmetic Fuchsian group (see subsection 3.1). Our main result
gives a bound on norms of the generators in terms of the degree of the invariant
trace ﬁeld k, the volume of G/Γ, and the spectral gap of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator on H2/Γ.

Theorem 1.1. There exists a constant C > 0 depending only on the Haar measure
µ and satisfying the following property. Let Γ be a cocompact arithmetic Fuchsian
subgroup of G with invariant trace ﬁeld k. Then Γ is generated by the ﬁnite subset

Here volµ(G/Γ) is the covolume of Γ with respect to the measure µ, and λ =
min{ 1
4 , λ1(Γ)} where λ1(Γ) is the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplace-
Beltrami operator on H2/Γ.

Note that over a ﬁnite-dimensional space the choice of norm k·k does not matter.
However, for completeness we take the L∞-norm. The coeﬃcient C in Theorem 1.1
can be explicitly calculated by following the methods of the proofs. Also, the result
can be strengthened for certain families of arithmetic Fuchsian groups Γ, as we now
describe.

3. Arithmetic Fuchsian groups

We recall the deﬁnition and some properties of arithmetic Fuchsian groups.

3.1. Deﬁnition and properties. Let k be a totally real number ﬁeld and A a
quaternion algebra over k ramiﬁed at all archimedean places except one. Let Rk
be the ring of integers in k, O an Rk-order in A, and O1 the elements of A-norm 1
in O. Let ρ be a k-embedding of A in M2(R), 2 × 2 matrices over R. Then ρ(O1)
is a Fuchsian group of ﬁnite covolume. By deﬁnition, a subgroup Γ in SL2(R) is
an arithmetic Fuchsian group if it is commensurable, up to conjugation, with some
such ρ(O1).

An arithmetic Fuchsian group Γ is called a congruence subgroup if there is a
maximal order O and an integral 2-sided O-ideal I of O in A such that Γ contains
ρ(O1(I)) where O1(I) = {a ∈ O1 : a − 1 ∈ I}.

The ﬁeld k in the deﬁnition of an arithmetic Fuchsian group Γ is a commen-
surability invariant and is recovered from Γ by kΓ = Q(tr(Γ(2)), where Γ(2) is
the subgroup generated by the squares of elements in Γ. The number ﬁeld kΓ is
the invariant trace ﬁeld of Γ. The quaternion algebra is also recovered from Γ by

AΓ = {P aiγi : ai ∈ kΓ, γi ∈ Γ(2)}. For the remainder of the paper, we assume Γ

is cocompact. The group Γ is cocompact when either k 6= Q or when k = Q and A
is a division algebra. We note also that for any γ ∈ Γ, trγ is an algebraic integer of
degree at most 2 over kΓ.

For more on arithmetic Fuchsian groups, including proofs of the statements

mentioned, the reader is referred to [12, Chapter 8].

3.2. Lehmer’s and Salem’s conjectures. The Mahler measure of an algebraic
integer θ is deﬁned by

(3.1)

M (θ) = |a0|Y max(1, |θi|)

where a0 is the leading coeﬃcient of the minimal polynomial for θ over Z and θi
ranges over the algebraic conjugates of θ.

In 1933 Lehmer posed the following conjecture:

Conjecture 3.1. [10] There exists a universal lower bound m > 1 such that M (θ) ≥
m for all θ which are not roots of unity.

A Salem number is a real algebraic integer θ > 1 such that θ−1 is a conjugate and
all other conjugates lie on the unit circle. For Salem numbers, Lehmer’s conjecture
restricts to the Salem conjecture.

Conjecture 3.2. There exists mS > 1 such that if θ is a Salem number then
M (θ) ≥ mS.

The Salem conjecture is equivalent to the short geodesic conjecture of arithmetic
2-manifolds, which states that there is a universal lower bound for translation length
for hyperbolic elements in arithmetic Fuchsian groups (see [14]). Assuming the
Salem conjecture, the bounds in Theorem 1.1 can be modiﬁed to depend only on the
covolume and the spectral gap whenever the group Γ contains no elliptic elements.

Corollary 3.3. If the Salem conjecture is true and Γ is a torsion free, cocompact,
arithmetic Fuchsian subgroup of G. Then Γ is generated by the ﬁnite subset

4.1. Injectivity radius. Throughout this section, let d be the degree of the the
invariant trace ﬁeld of Γ.

Lemma 4.1. Let Γ be a cocompact arithmetic Fuchsian group with invariant trace
ﬁeld of degree d and let

(4.1) Wd =(g ∈ G : 2 cos(cid:16) π

2d(cid:17) < |tr(g)| < 2 cosh  1

16(cid:18) log(log(2d))

log(2d) (cid:19)3!) .

Then for any g ∈ G, gΓg−1 ∩ Wd = {1}

Proof. By the cocompactness condition, we consider only hyperbolic and elliptic
elements in Γ.

If γ is hyperbolic then also γ2 is hyperbolic, with |tr(γ2)| > 2 and tr(γ2) ∈ kΓ.
Let uγ be the root of the characteristic polynomial x2 − tr(γ)x + 1 of γ which
lies outside the unit circle (respectively, let uγ 2 be the root of the characteristic
polynomial x2 − tr(γ2)x + 1 of γ2 outside the unit circle). We have uγ 2 real and
exactly two of its algebraic conjugates lie oﬀ the unit circle, namely uγ 2 and u−1
γ 2
(see e.g. [12, Lemma 12.3.1]). Therefore, log M (uγ 2) = log |uγ 2| = 2 log |uγ| where
M (uγ 2) is the Mahler measure (see Equation 3.1). As a hyperbolic element, γ
acts on the hyperbolic plane by translating along its invariant axis a distance of

2 log |uγ|. It then follows that |tr(γ)| = 2 cosh(cid:0) 1

4 log M (uγ 2)(cid:1) (see e.g. [12, Lemma

12.1.2]). Since uγ 2 lies in an extension of degree 2 over kΓ, it has algebraic degree

bounded above by 2d. We now apply the main theorem of [17] which states that
any algebraic integer θ of degree at most 2d has

(4.2)

log M (θ) >

log(2d) (cid:19)3
4(cid:18) log(log(2d))

to get the following bound for for the trace of a hyperbolic γ ∈ Γ

(4.3)

|tr(g)| > 2 cosh  1

16(cid:18) log(log(2d))

log(2d) (cid:19)3! .

If γ is elliptic then by the discreteness of Γ, γ has order m and thus eigenvalues
ω and ω−1 with |ω + ω−1| = |tr(γ)| < 2 and such that ω is a primitive 2m-th root of
unity. Since tr(γ) lies in a ﬁeld of degree at most 2 over kΓ, (ω + ω−1) has algebraic
degree of at most 2d, or equivalently, ω has algebraic degree of at most 4d. Then
|tr(γ)| = |uγ + u−1

γ | is bounded above by |e

2d ).

The injectivity radius of G/Γ at a point x = hΓ ∈ G/Γ is related to the distance
between the identity element and the nearest point in the lattice hΓh−1. Since the
trace of a matrix is invariant under conjugation, the bounds in Lemma 4.1 for the
traces of elements in any conjugate of Γ determine an injectivity radius for G/Γ.

For any η > 0 denote the ball of radius η centered at the identity 1 ∈ G by

BG(η) = {g ∈ g : kg − 1k < η} .

Lemma 4.2. There exists δ = δ(d) = cd−2 > 0 with c depending only on the Haar
measure µ, such that the map BG(δ) → G/Γ given by g 7→ g.x is injective for any
x ∈ G/Γ.

Proof. Let

(4.4)

δ0 = min(cosh  1

16(cid:18) log(log(2d))

log(2d) (cid:19)3! − 1, 1 − cos(cid:16) π

2d(cid:17)) .

Then for any 0 < δ1 < δ0 and g ∈ BG(δ1),

|g1,1 − 1| < δ1

and

|g2,2 − 1| < δ1,

where g1,1 and g2,2 are the (1, 1) and (2, 2) matrix entries of g. Then |tr(g)−2| < 2δ1
and g ∈ Wd.

By the Taylor series expansion of 1 − cos(π/2d),

1 − cos(cid:16) π

2d(cid:17) ≈

Since 1 − cos(cid:0) π

2d(cid:1) goes to 0 at a faster rate than cosh(cid:18) 1

16(cid:16) log(log(2d))

log(2d) (cid:17)3(cid:19) − 1 goes

to 0, there exists a positive constant c depending only on the measure µ such that
δ(d) := c · d−2 < δ0 and such that for all g1, g2 ∈ BG(δ), we have g−1
1 g2 ∈ BG(δ0)
For any x = hΓ ∈ G/Γ, if g1, g2 ∈ BG(δ) and g1.x = g2.x then g−1
1 g2 ∈ hΓh−1.
(cid:3)

1 g2 ∈ Wd and by Lemma 4.1 it must be that g1 = g2.

Hence g−1

Remark 4.3. When Γ is torsion free, only the traces of hyperbolic elements are rele-

log(2d) (cid:17)6
vant. In this case the constant δ(d) in Lemma 4.2 can be improved to c(cid:16) log(log(2d))
log(2d) (cid:17)6
For a cleaner statement, we use the estimate log(d)−4 ≪(cid:16) log(log(2d))

If the Salem conjecture is true, there is a universal lower bound for the trace of a
hyperbolic element in an arithmetic Fuchsian group. Then for ms the lower bound
satisfying the Salem conjecture, the constant δ can be improved to c log2(ms) for
all torsion free Γ. In particular, this constant would be independent of d.

4.2. Spectral gap. Let Γ be a cocompact Fuchsian group acting on the hyper-
bolic plane H2 from the right. Let λ1(Γ) be the ﬁrst non-zero eigenvalue of the
Laplacian operator on the locally symmetric space H2/Γ. Denote by λ = λ(Γ) :=

4.3. Translates. Given any two points in the G/Γ, some element h ∈ G will
translate one to the other. We use the injectivity radius, the spectral gap, and the
covolume to give an upper bound on the norm of some such element h.

Theorem 4.5. For any g1Γ, g2Γ ∈ G/Γ there is some h ∈ G and positive number
c such that h.g1Γ = g2Γ and

By Theorem 4.5, for any g ∈ G, there is some h ∈ U such that h.Γ = g.Γ. That
is, we can write g as hγ for some γ ∈ Γ. Therefore, we have constructed an open
set U ⊂ G such that UΓ = G. It follows that {γ ∈ Γ : U · γ ∩ U 6= ∅} generates Γ
(see e.g. [2, Lemma 6.6]). Then Γ is generated by the bigger set U −1U ∩ Γ, whose

The proof of Theorem 1.1 then follows by replacing δ with c[k : Q]−2, as given

Proof of Corollary 1.2. The proof of Corollary 1.2 follows from the well-known re-
sult that

(5.2)

λ1(Γ) ≥ 975/4096

for every congruence arithmetic Fuchsian group. For the sake of reader’s conve-
nience, we shall brieﬂy explain (Equation 5.2) in the case when kΓ = Q.

By the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence (see [5, Chapter 16]), if Γ is a congru-
ence arithmetic Fuchsian group with kΓ = Q then λ1(Γ) ≥ inf{λ1(Λ(N )) : N ∈ N},
where Λ(N ) = {γ ∈ SL2(Z) : γ ≡ 1 mod N }. As of this writing we have the esti-
mate, which is due to Kim-Sarnark [8],

(5.3)

inf{λ1(Λ(N )) : N ∈ N} ≥ 975/4096.

We note that, for the case when kΓ is a number ﬁeld, Equation 5.2 follows from
the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence together with the bounds on the Ramanujan
conjecture over number ﬁelds (see [1]).
(cid:3)

Proof of Corollary 1.3 and Corollary 3.3. The proof of Corollary 1.3 follows from
the proof of Theorem 1.1 by replacing δ with c log(d)−4 as in Remark 4.3. Further-
more, if we assume the Salem conjecture is true, then Corollary 3.3 will follow by
setting δ = c log2(ms) as in Remark 4.3.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.1. The arguments in the proof of Theorem 1.1 can be modiﬁed to give a
similar result for cocompact arithmetic Kleinian groups. All lemmas will go through
except that one would need an analogue of Lemma 4.4. An analogue of Lemma 4.4
(or [13, Corollary 2.1]) does hold. However, more work would need to be done to
get an explicit rate of the decay of correlations for functions on SL2(C)/Γ, from
the λ1 of the corresponding hyperbolic 3-manifold SU(2)\SL2(C)/Γ. At this time,
we are not aware of such a statement in the current literature.
