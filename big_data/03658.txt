Abstract

Shape memory alloys are a class of ferroic materials which undergo a structural (martensitic)

transition where the associated ferroic property is a lattice distortion (strain). The sensitiveness

of the transition to the conjugated external ﬁeld (stress), together with the latent heat of the

transition gives rise to giant mechanocaloric eﬀects. In non-magnetic shape memory alloys, the

lattice distortion is mostly described by a pure shear and the martensitic transition in this family

of alloys is strongly aﬀected by uniaxial stress whereas it is basically insensitive to hydrostatic pres-

sure. As a result, non-magnetic alloys exhibit giant elastocaloric eﬀects but negligible barocaloric

eﬀects. By contrast, in a number of magnetic shape memory alloys, the lattice distortion at the

martensitic transition involves a volume change in addition to the shear strain. Those alloys are

aﬀected by both uniaxial stress and hydrostatic pressure and they exhibit giant elastocaloric and

barocaloric eﬀects. The paper aims at providing a critical survey of available experimental data

on elastocaloric and barocaloric eﬀects in magnetic and non-magnetic shape memory alloys.

INTRODUCTION

Mechanocaloric eﬀects refer to the thermal response (adiabatic temperature and isother-

mal entropy changes) of a solid when subjected to an external stress. When the solid is

in the vicinity of a structural ﬁrst-order transition, these quantities can reach large values

for moderate stresses giving rise to the so-called giant caloric eﬀects1–4. These large values

are related to the release (or absorption) of the latent heat associated with the ﬁrst-order

transition. From an applied point of view, giant caloric materials are good candidates for

the development of an eﬃcient environmental friendly solid state refrigeration technology5.

Materials exhibiting giant mechanocaloric eﬀects add up to the family of materials with

giant magnetocaloric and electrocaloric eﬀects. While magnetic ﬁeld and magnetization, as

well as electric ﬁeld and polarization, have a vectorial character (rank-one tensors), stress

and strain are rank-two tensors. This means that even for isotropic materials a complete

characterization of the mechanocaloric eﬀect requires determination of the solid response

to two independent stresses, in contrast to magnetocaloric and electrocaloric eﬀects which

are fully characterized by the response to the magnetic or electric ﬁeld applied on a given

direction. Experimentally, the typical stresses applied to measure mechanocaloric eﬀects are

uniaxial load and hydrostatic pressure. The thermal response to uniaxial load is known as

elastocaloric eﬀect and to a hydrostatic pressure, barocaloric eﬀect.

Prominent among the materials exhibiting giant mechanocaloric eﬀects are shape memory

alloys. On cooling, these alloys undergo a transition from a high-temperature (high symme-

try) cubic structure towards a lower-temperature (lower symmetry) close-packed structure.

This is the martensitic transition which is ﬁrst-order and difusionless, with a lattice dis-

tortion which is mostly given by a shear. Such a shear distortion is signiﬁcantly large and

makes the martensitic transition strongly sensitive to application of external uniaxial stress,

which gives rise to a series of unique thermomechanical properties exhibited by these alloys

such as shape memory eﬀect, pseudoelasticity and superelasticity6. More recently7 it has

also been shown that shape memory alloys do also exhibit giant elastocaloric eﬀects.

Shape memory alloys can be broadly classed into two categories: conventional (non-

magnetic) and magnetic. While in non-magnetic alloys the volume of the cubic unit cell

is very close to that of the martensitic unit cell, in magnetic alloys the coupling between

magnetic and structural degrees of freedom can give rise to relatively large volume changes

2

(which can reach ∼ 0.5-1 % ) at the martensitic transition. The martensitic transition in

conventional shape memory alloys is therefore largely insensitive to hydrostatic pressure and

these compounds do not present signiﬁcant barocaloric eﬀects. However in magnetic shape

memory alloys the transition can by aﬀected by hydrostatic pressure8 and these alloys are

prone to exhibit barocaloric eﬀects9.

Another interesting peculiarity of magnetic shape memory alloys is the interplay between

structural and magnetic degrees of freedom which enables the transition to be driven by

the application of any of the ﬁelds conjugated to the order parameters of the transition

(uniaxial stress, hydrostatic pressure and magnetic ﬁeld). This property gives rise to the

so-called multicaloric eﬀects3,10 which oﬀer new possibilities in the prospects for solid-state

refrigeration. In the present paper we will overview elastocaloric eﬀects associated with the

application of uniaxial stress in conventional shape memory alloys, and both elastocaloric

and barocaloric eﬀects in magnetic shape memory alloys.

II. THE MEASUREMENT OF MECHANOCALORIC EFFECTS

The isothermal entropy change (∆S) and the adiabatic temperature change (∆T ) associ-

ated with the application (or removal) of an external stress can be derived from experiments

by a variety of measurement protocols which are broadly classed into indirect, quasi-direct

and direct methods.

Indirect methods involve the measurement of the temperature and stress dependence of

the strain and rely on the use of the Maxwell relations.

Isoﬁeld temperature scans that

cover the whole temperature range over which the transition spreads are preferable than

isothermal stress scans. This is because the former are free from a possible overestimation

of entropy changes which may occur when isothermal measurements are carried out in a

mixed two-phase state. For elastocaloric materials, length changes across the transition can

be measured by suitable strain gauges and the entropy change (per mass unit) can then be

computed as:

∆S(T, F ) =

1

m Z F

0 (cid:18) ∂L

∂T (cid:19)F

dF

(1)

where F is the applied uniaxial load, and m and L are, respectively, the mass and the gauge

length of the specimen. An alternative expression in terms of strain ǫ and stress σ is:

3

∆S(T, σ) =

1

ρ Z σ

0 (cid:18) ∂ǫ

∂T (cid:19)σ

dσ

(2)

where ρ is the mass density, σ ≃ F/A (with A the cross section which is assumed to be

constant) and ǫ = (L − L0)/L0, with L0, the gauge length at zero stress. In the case of

the barocaloric eﬀect, volume changes across structural transitions are typically small and it

becomes diﬃcult to perform suitable measurements with enough accuracy to allow a reliable

numerical computation of ∆S using equations 1 and 2.

Quasi-direct methods are based on diﬀerential scanning calorimety (DSC) under applied

external ﬁelds.

In that case, DSC heating and cooling runs are performed at diﬀerent

(constant) values of the applied external stress. This kind of calorimeters are available in

the case of barocaloric eﬀects (DSC under hydrostatic pressure) but, at present, no suitable

DSCs are available that can operate under uniaxial external loads. Data from DSC under

ﬁeld are complemented with speciﬁc heat (C) data away from the structural transition and

it is assumed that in those regions C is not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by pressure. From these

data, the entropy S(T, p) (referenced to the value at a given temperature T0) is computed.

Then, the entropy change associated with the application of a pressure p is obtained by

subtracting the S(T, p) curves computed at diﬀerent values of pressure:

∆S(T, 0 → p) = S(T, p) − S(T, 0)

(3)

(where p = 0 refers to atmospheric pressure).

This method also permits computing the adiabatic temperature change by subtracting

the corresponding T (S, p) curves:

∆T (S, 0 → p) = T (S, p) − T (S, 0)

(4)

Direct determination of entropy changes require the use of DSCs under ﬁeld that can

operate isothermally while the ﬁeld is scanned11–13. Unfortunately until now this technique

is not available for the study of mechanocaloric eﬀects. On the other hand, direct mea-

surements of adiabatic temperature changes can be performed by suitable thermometers

attached to the studied sample or alternatively by means of non-contact infrared thermom-

etry. The adiabaticity of these measurements relies on the ratio between the characteristic

time constant associated with the application (or removal) of the stress and the time con-

4

stant associated with the heat exchange between sample and surroundings. In the case of

barocaloric eﬀects, the sample is surrounded by the pressure-transmitting ﬂuid and mea-

surements are not fully adiabatic thereby leading to measured ∆T values which are always

underestimated. However, in most elastocaloric experiments the sample is typically in air,

and application (or removal) of uniaxial stresses at strain rates greater than 0.1 s−1 have

proved to be close to the adiabatic limit and therefore provide reliable data for the adiabatic

temperature change.

It is also worth mentioning that it is customary to estimate temperature changes from

measured entropy changes (or alternatively entropy changes from measured temperature

data) by means of the relationship:

∆T ≃ −

T
C

∆S

(5)

It must be taken into account, however, that such an estimation may provide data which

are overestimated for ∆T and underestimated for ∆S 14.

III. CONVENTIONAL (NON-MAGNETIC) SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS.

There are two major families of non-magnetic shape memory alloys: Cu-based and Ti-

Ni based alloys. The lattice distortion at the martensitic transition corresponds to a pure
shear of the {110} planes along the < 1¯10 > directions and the volume change is negligible

small15. The open bcc structure has low-energy transverse TA2 phonons which confer to

this phase a large vibrational entropy16 whereas the vibrational entropy of the martensitic

phase is lower. Hence the major contribution to the transition entropy change giving rise to

the giant mechanocaloric eﬀect in these alloys has a vibrational (phonon) origin.

Cu-based alloys transform from a DO3 or L21 (F m3m) ordered structures to a mono-

clinic one whose structure can alternatively be described by a larger unit cell which can be

approximated to be orthorhombic (18R, I2/m) or hexagonal (2H, P nmm) for which the

monoclinic angle is very small17. Depending on the alloy composition, the martensitic phase

can exhibit a variety of structures which diﬀer in the modulation of the close-packed planes.

First results of a giant elastocaloric eﬀect in shape memory alloys were reported on

a Cu-Zn-Al single crystal7 where isothermal entropy changes were computed from stress-

strain experiments. Later experiments18–21 have been performed on both single crystals and

polycrystals in tensile and compressive modes, including direct measurements of adiabatic

temperature changes. As a summary, those experiments have proved that Cu-based alloys

exhibit a large isothermal entropy change (∆S ∼ 20 J/kg K) which can be achieved already

at very low values of the applied stress (around 25 MPa for experiments carried out at

temperatures close to the stress-free martensitic transition temperature). Such an entropy

value coincides with the transition entropy change (∆St), which is very weakly dependent

upon composition22, and represents the upper bound for the elastocaloric eﬀect in these

compounds. With regards to the temperature change, some experiments lack perfect adia-

baticity because the grips act as thermal sinks and the measured values (solid blue diamonds

in ﬁg. 1) are lower than expected. However, for long enough samples good adiabaticity can

be achieved and reported values (∆T ∼10-14 K, open blue diamond in ﬁg. 1)23,24 approach

Another important family of conventional SMA is the one based on Ti-Ni. These alloys

transform from a B2 (P m3m) ordered cubic structure to a monoclinic B19’ (P 2/m) marten-

sitic phase. It must be taken into account, however, that depending on the speciﬁc heat

treatment and doping with a third element, the transformation path can take place via in-

termediate structural phases. For suitably annealed samples, the cubic structure transforms

towards a trigonal R (P 3) phase, which upon further cooling transforms towards the mono-

clinic B19’ phase. The reverse transformation upon heating takes place in a single step from

B19’ to B2. On the other hand, in Cu-doped samples (with Cu≥ 5%), the B2 phase trans-

forms towards an orthorhombic B19 (P mma) martensitic phase. A thorough description of

the details of the martensitic transition in Ti-Ni alloys is beyond the scope of the present

paper, and they can be found in ref.25. For present purposes it is important to recall that

B2 ↔ B19’ transition has a large latent heat (with a transition entropy change ∆St in the

range 60-90 J/kg K), and a large hysteresis26,27. The B2 ↔ B19 has a slightly lower latent

heat (∆St ∼ 50-60 J/kg K), and a lower hysteresis26. The B2 ↔ R transition has a much

lower latent heat (∆St ∼ 15-20 J/kg K) and a very reduced hysteresis27. It is also worth

pointing out that B2 ↔ R and B2 ↔ B19 transitions exhibit an excellent reproducibility

upon thermal and stress cycling. The critical stress to induce the B2 → B19’ transition is

larger than for the B2 → B19 and B2 → R transitions, which means that typically stresses

above 500 MPa are required to achieve a giant elastocaloric eﬀec associated with the B2 ↔

B19’ transition, whereas the B → R transition requires much lower stresses.

The elastocaloric properties of Ti-Ni-based shape memory alloys have been studied by

several research groups21,27–37. Experiments have been carried out in tensile and compres-

sive modes in single crystals and polycrystals and diﬀerent shapes such as wires, ﬁlms, etc

have been the subject of investigation. Most of the studies correspond to direct adiabatic

temperature measurements and only a few of them report isothermal entropy data. The

behaviour exhibited by ﬁlms and wires compares well with that exhibited by bulk samples

(including single crystals). The B2 ↔ B19’ transition provides the largest values for ∆T

(red circles in ﬁg. 1), with measured values that can reach 25-60 K21,28–32. Values for the B2

↔ B19 are lower (red star in ﬁg. 1), in the range 10-15 K28,34. No direct ∆T measurements

are reported for the B2 ↔ R transition, but based on the entropy data27, values are expected

to be around 10 K (red hexagon in ﬁg. 1). With regards to the entropy change, large values

(∆S ∼ 60-80 J/kg K) have been reported for the B2 ↔ B19’ transition although ∆S values

8

can be reduced in samples that have been trained for many cycles31. The isothermal entropy

change associated with the B2 ↔ R transition is ∆S ∼ 13 J/kg K. It is worth noting that

although the B2 ↔ B19’ transition has a much larger entropy change, this value is not

reproducible when the sample is cycled at low stress values, while an excellent reproducibil-

ity is obtained for the B2 ↔ R transition27. No entropy data are available for the B2 ↔

B19 transition, but the maximum (which is bounded by the latent heat of the transition) is

expected to be ∼ 50-60 J/kg K.

A comparison of the properties of Cu-based and Ti-Ni based alloys can be found in

Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 shows that the transition temperature in Cu-based alloys is more

sensitive to the applied stress than in Ni-Ti alloys. The shift in the transition temperature

with stress is given by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation dT /dσ = −v∆ǫ/∆St where v is the

speciﬁc volume, ∆ǫ, the transition strain (determined by the crystallographic change) and

∆St, the transition entropy change. While ∆ǫ for Cu-based alloys is comparable to that for

the B2 ↔ B19’ transition (∆ǫ ∼ 7-10 %), the lower ∆St for Cu-based alloys results in a

larger dT /dσ. With regards to the B2 ↔ R transition the low dT /dσ values are due to a

reduced transition shear strain (∆ǫ ∼ 0.5-1 %).

Figure 3 compares the elastocaloric eﬀect for Cu-based and Ti-Ni-based alloys in terms

of the maximum value for the isothermal stress-induced entropy change, as a function of

stress. Data have been obtained using the indirect method (stress vs. temperature curves

at ﬁxed values of stress). The B2 ↔ B19’ transition in Ti-Ni exhibits large values which

are signiﬁcantly reduced for trained samples. It is also worth taking into account that these

large values are not reproducible under stress cycling for low values of the stress (below 500

MPa). A distinctive feature for Cu-based alloys is that the maximum ∆S is achieved for

very low stress values (σ ≤ 100 MPa). These values are reproducible under stress cycling

for stresses as low as 100 MPa. The B2 ↔ R exhibits moderate values, which for stresses up

to 200 MPa are below the value corresponding to the transition entropy change, indicating

that for these values of the stress it is not possible to achieve transformation of the whole

sample.

IV. MAGNETIC SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS.

The martensitic transition in Fe-based magnetic alloys was studied many decades ago

and some of these alloys, like ordered Fe-Pt and Fe-Pd were shown to exhibit shape memory

properties38. However, it was with the report of magnetic shape memory in a Ni-Mn-Ga

single crystal39 that the research in magnetic shape memory alloys experienced an enormous

increase. Since then, a plethora of Ni-based (and some Co-based) Heusler alloys have been

reported to exhibit martensitic transitions with associated magnetic shape memory40,41. For

magnetic shape memory alloys (MSMA) the high temperature cubic phase is ferromagnetic,

and depending on composition the martensitic transition can take place above or below the

Curie point. The interest is mostly focussed on those alloys transforming martensitically

close or below the Curie point because they exhibit a variety of interesting properties related

to the application of magnetic ﬁeld. Depending on the magnetic order of the martensitic

phase, magnetic shape memory alloys are broadly classed into two categories: alloys with a

ferromagnetically ordered martensitic phase, and alloys for which the martensitic phase is

weakly magnetic (which are also known as metamagnetic shape memory alloys). For meta-

magnetic shape memory alloys, the magnetic structure of the martensite is still a subject of

debate42,43 but the presence of short range antiferromagnetic interactions has been experi-

mentally conﬁrmed44. In these metamagnetic shape memory alloys there is a large change

in magnetization at the martensitic transition and therefore the transition temperature is

strongly sensitive to magnetic ﬁeld which gives rise to the magnetic superelasticity45,46 and

inverse magnetocaloric eﬀects47.

From a crystallographic point of view, the high temperature phase is cubic (F m3m). The

martensitic structure in Fe-based alloys is a fct (P 4/mmm)48, and for Heusler compounds

the martensitic structure can be tetragonal or modulated monoclinic, depending on alloy

composition41. Similar to conventional (non-magnetic alloys), the lattice distortion can be
mostly described by a shear of the {110} planes along the < 1¯10 > directions. However, in

this case, the interplay between magnetism and structure can give rise to a volume change

of the unit cell. Such a volume change is particularly relevant for those alloys with a

large change in magnetization at the martensitic transition49 and therefore the martensitic

transition in metamagnetic shape memory alloys will be sensitive to applied hydrostatic

pressure8 thereby giving rise to barocaloric eﬀects, which will be discussed in the following

10

sections.

In magnetic shape memory alloys there are two major contributions to the entropy:

vibrational and magnetic. The leading contribution is the vibrational one, which, as occurs

in non-magnetic alloys, has its origin on the low-energy TA2 phonons which confer the

high-temperature cubic phase a large vibrational entropy. For those alloys transforming

between a ferromagnetic cubic phase and a ferromagnetic martensite the magnetic entropy

plays a minor role. However, in metamagnetic shape memory alloys, the martensitic phase

has a magnetic entropy larger than that of the cubic phase. Therefore the vibrational and

magnetic degrees of freedom contribute in an opposite way to the transition entropy change.

A detailed discussion on the signiﬁcance of each contribution to the relative stability of cubic

and martensitic phases can be found in ref.50.

A. Elastocaloric eﬀects.

Reports on the elastocaloric properties of magnetic shape memory alloys are very

recent36,51–62.

Intermetallic magnetic Heusler alloys are typically very brittle and they cannot support

stresses as large as those typically applied to non-magnetic shape memory alloys. Indeed,

the ﬁrst reports on Ni-Mn-Ga alloys (doped with Co and Fe to improve their toughness) were

limited to very low stresses (∼ 10 MPa), with a reduced stress-induced entropy change (∼

3-6 J/kg K)51,52. Later, it was possible to develop tougher alloys by suitable doping and/or

by preparing them as textured material or even single crystals, and stresses in the range

100-300 MPa have been investigated. Both magnetic shape memory and metamagnetic

alloys have been the subject of investigation, and the majority of the results deal with

direct measurements of adiabatic temperature changes with only a few of them reporting on

entropy measurements. Illustrative data are compiled in ﬁgures 1, 2 and 3 where they are

compared to data for the conventional SMA.

In most cases, the sensitivity of the transition temperature to uniaxial stress is lower than

in Cu-based alloys and it is comparable to that of Ni-Ti (see ﬁg. 2), with the exception of

Ni-Fe-Ga single crystals stressed along the [001] direction. In that case, the large dT /dσ

arises form a very large transition strain ǫ ∼ 14.5 % and a moderate transition entropy

change (∆St ∼ 16-20 J/kgK)36. Reported ∆T values (black squares in ﬁg. 1) are in the

11

range 2-15 K, lower than those corresponding to Cu-based and Ti-Ni-based alloys. Those

lower values are likely to be due to the reduced values of the applied stress together with a

moderate dT /dσ which result in a partial transformation of the sample. It is worth noting

that the transition entropy change in many of these alloys may exceed that of Cu-based

alloys with values that for suitable compositions can reach up to ∆St ∼ 80 J/kg K63,64.

Hence much larger ∆T could be expected if the applied stress was large enough to induce

the transformation of the whole sample. With regards to the isothermal entropy change, in

addition to the previously mentioned values at low stresses, data have only been reported

for a Ni-Mn-Sb-Co alloy58. ∆S data are shown as a function of the applied stress in ﬁgure

3 in comparison with those for conventional shape memory alloys. A maximum value of

∆S ∼ 20 J/kg K was found for the maximum applied stress of 100 MPa. This value is

about 60 % of the total entropy change of that alloy (which provides the upper bound for

the elastocaloric eﬀect).

The behaviour for Fe-Pd is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that of the Heusler alloys61,62. The

martensitic transition for this alloy is weakly ﬁrst order (also termed second order like),

with a low entropy change (∆St ∼ 1.2 J/kg K) and a reduced hysteresis. Nevertheless, the

second-order characteristics of the transition imply that ∂ǫ

∂T is not only given by the transition

strain but it has also signiﬁcant contributions beyond the transition region, and the resulting

entropy (and temperature) change associated with the elastocaloric eﬀect (see eqs. 1 and 2)

is not bounded by the latent heat of the transition. The low ∆St combined with a moderate

transition strain ǫ ∼ 1.5 % provides a signiﬁcantly large dT /dσ (see ﬁg. 2), although that

value must be taken cautiously because ǫ drastically changes with temperature and a critical

point is expected at σc ∼ 40 MPa and Tc ∼ 280 K65. The values for the elastocaloric eﬀect

(black triangle in ﬁg. 1) are moderate (ﬁgs. 1 and 3) ∆T ∼ 3 K and ∆S ∼ 4-5 J/kg K, but

with an excellent reproducibility upon stress cycling.

B. Barocaloric eﬀects.

At present there are only a few reports on the barocaloric eﬀect in magnetic shape memory

alloys and until now data have been reported for Ni-Mn-In9,66 and Ni-Co-Mn-Ga67. A reason

for this scarcity of data is the need for purpose-built experimental systems68 which are not

usually at hand in many laboratories. Another reason is that among magnetic shape memory

12

alloys only a few of them do have a volume change at the martensitic transition large enough

to give rise to a signiﬁcant barocaloric eﬀect. The strength of the barocaloric eﬀect depends

on the sensitivity of the martensitic transition to hydrostatic pressure, and as shown in the

inset of ﬁgure 2, values for dT /dp are in the range 5-40 K/GPa8,9,66,69–74 which are about

one order of magnitude smaller than the dT /dσ corresponding to uniaxial stress. Such a

diﬀerence is a reﬂect that the major contribution to the lattice distortion at the martensitic

transition is a shear strain.

elastocaloric and barocaloric eﬀects, as a function of the applied stress. Solid green symbols stand

for the elastocaloric eﬀect in Ni-Mn-Sb-Co and open blue symbols, for the barocaloric eﬀect in

Ni-Mn-In.

Figure 4 compares the barocaloric ∆S values in Ni-Mn-In to the corresponding data for

the elastocaloric eﬀect in Ni-Mn-Sb-Co. Although the barocaloric strength is lower, the

ﬁnal ∆S values are larger ∆S ∼ 25 J/kg K because larger stresses can be applied in the

hydrostatic case whereas the intrinsic brittelness of magnetic shape memory alloys limits the

maximum uniaxial stress. It must be taken into account, however, that the low dT /dp values,

along with a relatively large hysteresis, result in a poor reversibility of the barocaloric eﬀect

upon cycling, while good reversibility does indeed exist for the elastocaloric eﬀect. With

13

regards to the adiabatic temperature change, ∆T values are only moderate (∆T ∼ 4 K, inset

in ﬁg. 1), again reﬂecting the weak sensitivity of the martensitic transition to hydrostatic

pressure.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Materials with giant mechanocaloric eﬀects provide a good alternative for eﬃcient and

environmentally friendly cooling technologies and they complement the more mature mag-

netocaloric and electrocaloric ones. Shape memory alloys exhibit excellent mechanocaloric

properties linked to their martensitic transformation. On the one hand, a number of mag-

netic shape memory alloys present ∆S and ∆T values that compare favourably to those

reported for other giant barocaloric materials68,75–79. On the other hand, the extreme sensi-

tivity of the transition temperatures to uniaxial stress confers shape memory alloys unique

elastocaloric properties.

In view of possible applications of shape memory alloys in cooling devices, the elas-

tocaloric eﬀect in these materials have the following important advantages in relation to

magnetocaloric and electrocaloric materials. First, the strong sensitivity of the transition

temperature to the applied stress enables the transition to be induced at temperatures far

away from the stress-free transition temperature, which confer these alloys an extremely

broad operation range which is limited at low values by the zero stress transition tempera-

ture and at higher temperatures by the limit of plasticity of the material. Values as large

as 130 K have been reported for Cu-Zn-Al SMA which result in an outstanding refrigerant

capacity of ∼ 2300 J/kg. Second, the elastocaloric eﬀect in SMA exhibits an excellent cyclic

reversibility: the large ∆S and ∆T values have been found to be very reproducible upon

stress-cycling for a large number of cycles. It is worth emphasazing that ultralow fatigue

Ti-Ni-Cu alloys have recently been developed for which the martensitic transition does not

evolve for more than 10 million transformation cycles80.

While it is not foreseen that giant mechanocaloric materials will substitute electrocaloric

and magnetocaloric ones, it is expected that each of them will have their own niche of

applicability and the combination of all these phenomena should contribute to the gradual

replacement of present refrigeration systems which feature lower eﬃciencies and are based

on contaminant ﬂuids.
