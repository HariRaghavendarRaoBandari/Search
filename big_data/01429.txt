Abstract

The possibility of immunized and improving the entanglement of accelerated systems via
local ﬁltering is discussed. The maximum bounds of entanglement depend on the dimensions
of the accelerated and the ﬁltered subsystems. If the small dimensional subsystem is acceler-
ated and the large dimensional subsystem is ﬁltered, one can get a long-lived entanglement.
Moreover, if the larger subsystem is accelerated, then by ﬁltering any subsystem, the upper
bounds of entanglement of the ﬁltered state are larger then that for the initial states.For any
accelerated subsystem, the entanglement always increases as the ﬁlter strength of the large
dimensional subsystem increases.

Introduction

It is well known that, to perform quantum information tasks, maximum entangled states are
required. Although, it is possible to generate such states, mainting their isolation is a very diﬃcult
task. There are many studies devoted to investigate the behavior of entanglement in diﬀerent
environments [2]. On the other hand, the possibility of using these noise states to perform some
quantum information is studied from diﬀerent point of views[3].

Due to the interaction with the environments the amount of entanglement decreases and ac-
cordingly their eﬃciency to perform quantum information tasks decreases. Therefore, it is a
necessity to improve the weakness of entanglement. For this aim, there are diﬀerent protocols
of puriﬁcations that have been introduced [4, 5, 6, 7], where the main idea of these protocols is
based on local quantum operations, classical communication and measurements. So, one can get
a smaller numbers of strongly entangled qubits from a large number of weakly entangled ones.
Bennett. et.al.
[8], showed that local ﬁltering can be used to increase the entanglement of a
two-qubit by applying it on one of its subsystems. A single local ﬁlter operation can be used to
retrieve the loss of entanglement of particles passing through noise channels [9]. Moreover local
ﬁltering is used to increase the entanglement of subsystem at the expense of the other subsystem
[10]. The eﬀect of local ﬁltering on the dynamics of some measures of quantum correlation of a
general two qubit state is discusses by Karmakar et. al, [11].

Some eﬀorts have been done recently to investigate the survival amount of entanglement be-
tween diﬀerent accelerated systems [12]. These accelerated states can be used to perform some
quantum information tasks such as teleportation [13] and quantum coding [14]. Due to the ac-
celeration, the entanglement between the accelerated partners decreases, where the decay rate
depends on the initial acceleration and the dimension of the accelerated subsystem. Therefore,
it is worth to investigate, the possibility of improving the entanglement between the accelerated
particles by ﬁltering one of the subsystems. We introduce this idea by using a state composite of
two diﬀerent dimensional subsystems; qubit (2D) and qutrit (3D). This state is described by one

1

parameter, known as one parameter family[15], where it is shown that, if the larger subsystem is
accelerated the rate of entanglement decay is larger than that depicted for accelerating the small
dimension subsystem [17].

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec.2, we deﬁne the qubit-qutrit state and its ﬁnal
form in the non-inertial frame when one or both particles are accelerated. The ﬁltering process is
discussed in Sec.3, where analytical solutions are obtained for the ﬁnal ﬁltered states. The degree
of entanglement between the accelerated partner is quantiﬁed by using the negativity as a measure
of entanglement. Finally, we summarize or results and conclusions in Sec. 4.

2 The suggested model

We consider a state that represents a class of qubit-qutrit system in 2×3 dimensional and described
by only one parameter. In the computation basis 00, 01.02, 10, 11, 12, it takes the form

following cases:accelerated and ﬁltered qubit, accelerated qubit and ﬁltered qutrit, accelerated
qutrit and ﬁltered qubit and accelerated and ﬁltered qutrit.

2.1 Accelerated the subsystems

First, we review the relation between Monkowski and Rindler spaces [18, 19]. For qubit systems,
if the coordinates of a particle is deﬁned by (t, z) in Minkowski space, then in Rindlier space it is
deﬁned by (τ, x), where

τ = r tanh(t/z),

x = √t2 − z2, −∞ < r < ∞, −∞ < x < ∞.

(2)

Also, the annihilation operators aku and b−kU in Minkowski space can be written by means of
Rindler operators [20, 21] (c(I)
kR,

dII
−kL) as,

akU = cosrbc(I)
−kU = e−iφ sin rbc(I)
b†

kR − e−iφ sin rbdII

(3)

where tan rb = Exp[−πω c
a], 0 ≤ rb ≤ π/4, −∞ ≤ a ≤ ∞, ω is the frequency,c is the speed of
light, and φ is the phase space which can be absorbed in the deﬁnition of the operators[21]. The
relations (3), mix a particle in the region I and its anti-particle in the region II such that the
computational basis |0kiand |1ki can be written as[17],

|0ki = cos rb|0kiI|0−kiII + sin rb|1kiI|1−kiII,
|1ki = a†

k|0ki = |1kiI|0kiII.

(4)

Now, for qutrit systems, the Minkowski vacuum state |0mi, spin up state |Ui, spin down state |Di
and the pair state |Pi, in the Rindler space are deﬁned in [17, 22, 23] as

|0Mi = cos2 rt|0iI|0iII +
|UMi = cos rt|UiI|0iII + eiφ sin rt|PiI|UiII,
|DMi = cos rt|DiI|0iII − eiφ sin rt|PiI|DiII.

eiφ sin 2rt(|UiI|DiII + |DiI|UiII) + e2iφsin2rt|DiI|PiII,

(5)

By using the initial state (1) and the transformations (4), one gets the ﬁnal state of the accelerated
system, where only the qubit is accelerated. After tracing out the mode in region II, the ﬁnal
accelerated state between Alice and Bob in the ﬁrst region, I can be written as,

ρac−b = A1|00ih00| + A2|01ih01| + A3|00ih12| + A4|12ih00|
+A5|10ih02| + A6|02ih10| + A7|02ih02| + A8|10ih10|

Similarly, to accelerate the qutrit one uses the transformation (5) and the initial state (1). However
by tracing out the mode in II, the ﬁnal accelerated state between the partners in the ﬁrst region
takes the form,

ρac−t = B1|00ih00| + B2|01ih01| + B3|02ih02| + B4|0Pih0P|

3 Filtering process

In this section, we investigate the eﬀect of the local ﬁlter operation on the behavior of the degree of
entanglement. For qubit system the ﬁlter operation is deﬁned by a non-trace preserving operator
[25, 9]. In the computational basis the ﬁlter operator Fb can be described by

Fb = √κ|0ih0| + √1 − κ|1ih1|

where, 0 < κ < 1. Let us assume that the accelerated state is given by ρac−qi, where i = b, t. If
the qubit is ﬁltered then the ﬁltered state is given by [9, 26]

where Nb = tr n(cid:16)Fb ⊗ I3×3(cid:17)ρac−qi(cid:16)F †

Fig.(1), describes the behavior of entanglement of the accelerated system between Alice and
Bob after performing the ﬁltering process, where diﬀerent values of the ﬁltering strengths
are considered. The eﬀect of the ﬁltering parameter κ,( only Alice qubit is ﬁltered), on the
degree of entanglement is investigated.
It is clear that, for small values of κ, the initial
degree of entanglement (rb = 0) is smaller than that depicted for the non-ﬁltered case (solid-
curve). However, as one increases κ ∈ [0, 0.5], the decay rate of entanglement decreases and
consequently the lower bounds of entanglement increase. Moreover, for κ = 0.5 the upper
bound of entanglement is larger than that displayed for the non-ﬁltered case. This behavior
is changed dramatically for κ ∈ (0.5, 1), where the initial degree of entanglement is smaller
than that shown for the non-ﬁltered case. As rb increases, the entanglement increases and
when the acceleration goes to inﬁnity, the entanglement is much better than the non-ﬁltered
case.

Fig.(2) shows the behavior of entanglement when Bob’s particle (qutrit) is ﬁltered.
It is
clear that, for small values of the ﬁltering parameter Q, the initial degree of entanglement
is smaller than that depicted for the non-ﬁltered case (solid curve). As one increases Q, the
entanglement increases and slightly degreases at rb → ∞. However for Q ∈ (0.3, 1), the
upper bounds of entanglement at rb → ∞ are always larger compared with the non-ﬁltered
case. It is clear that, the entanglement can be immunized from decaying by applying the
ﬁltering at the decreasing points. For example, at rb ∼ 0.6, the entanglement decay can be
prevented, if the qutrit is ﬁltered with a strength Q = 0.5.
From Figs.(1) and (2) one can concludes that, local ﬁltering can improve the degree of
entanglement for the accelerating systems. The long lived entanglement can be displayed if
the qutrit is ﬁltered for any values of the strength’s ﬁlter Q. For some particular values of κ
one can obtain a long-lived entanglement. If the qubit is ﬁltered, the entanglement increases
for rb → ∞, while it slightly decreases if the qutrit is ﬁltered. Therefore, if the smaller
dimensional subsystem is accelerated and the larger dimensional subsystem is ﬁltered, one
obtains a long-lived entanglement between the partners. Moreover, local ﬁltering, not only
can be used to immunize the entanglement but also can be used to improve it. So, it can be
considered as a resource of quantum puriﬁcation to improve the eﬃciency of the accelerated
state.

In Fig.(3), we investigate the behavior of entanglement against the ﬁltering strengths κ
and Q, where diﬀerent values of rb are considered.
In Fig.(3a), the maximum values of
entanglement depend on the initial acceleration and the strength of the ﬁlter. For small
accelerations the upper bounds of entanglement at a ﬁxed values of κ ∈ (0, 0.5) are much

of κ ∈ (0.5, 1), where the larger acceleration, the smaller upper bounds of entanglement.

for larger accelerations’s values.

3.2 Bob’s qutrit is accelerated

In this case, the ﬁnal state between Alice and Bob is given by Eq.(8). We consider the
following possibilities:

• Alice ’s qubit is ﬁltered

For this case Alice uses the ﬁlter deﬁned by Eq.(11) to ﬁlter her qubit. After ﬁnishing the
ﬁltering process, the partners Alice and Bob share the following state.

κ < 0.5. However for farther values of κ the upper bounds of entanglement decrease. For
larger values of κ > 0.8, the degree of entanglement is smaller than that displayed for the
non-ﬁltered case (solid curves).

• Bob’s qutrit is ﬁltered

In this case we assume that only Bob particle (qutrit) is accelerated and has the ability to
ﬁlter it. The ﬁnal state of these two operations is given by,

t−F =

where Bi, i = ...10 are given by (6) and ˜Nt−F = P5
In Fig.(5), the eﬀect of the ﬁltered qutrit on the entanglement of the accelerated state is
investigated. It is clear that, the entanglement increases as the ﬁltering strength Q increases.
For small values of Q ∈ (0, 0.5), the ﬁlter process can not improve E. However, for small
range of rt ∈ (0.45, 8) the entanglement can be improved if we set Q = 0.5. Moreover for
any value of Q ∈ (0.5, 1) the degree of entanglement is much better than that shown for the
non ﬁltered case (solid curve).

accelerations. The maximum values of entanglement are large for small values of the accel-
eration. However, for further values of κ, the entanglement decreases. These phenomena

Q increases. Also, the maximum values of E are reached for small values of rt as shown in
Fig.(6b).

From Figs.(1) and (5), one can conclude that:
it is possible to improve the entanglement
between the partners if one user has accelerated his(her) subsystem. The improvement of
the degree of entanglement depends on the initial acceleration, where for small accelerations
one can improve it by controlling the ﬁltering strength. For ﬁxed accelerations, the maxi-
mum values of the entanglement can be reached as one increases the qutrit’s ﬁlter strength.
The longed lived entanglement can be obtained if the smaller dimension subsystem (qubit)
is accelerated and the larger dimensional subsystem (qutrit) is ﬁltered. If the qutrit is accel-
erated one can increase the initial entanglement by ﬁltering either the qubit or the qutrit.
Meanwhile, the initial entanglement can not be increased if the small dimension subsystem
(qubit )is accelerated and either the qubit or the qutrit is ﬁltered.

Comparing Figs.(3) and (6), we can see that for any subsystem accelerated the entanglement
can be increased as the qutrit’s ﬁlter strength is increased. On the other hand, if any
subsystem is accelerated and Alice has the ability to ﬁlter her qubit, then the maximum
values of entanglement depend on the initial acceleration and the values of the qubit’s ﬁlter
strength

4 Conclusion

In this contribution, the possibility of improving the entanglement of an accelerated state con-
sists of two diﬀerent dimensional subsystems is investigated. A state composed of qubit (two-
dimensional) and qutrit (three dimensional) is considered to illustrate this idea . This state is
described by only one parameter and it is known one-parameter family. Diﬀerent cases are con-
sidered, where it is assumed that only one particle is accelerated. The ﬁnal state in Minkowski
space is obtained analytically for all cases. To improve the entanglement or decreasing the rate of
entanglement decay, we consider only one ﬁltered subsystem (qubit/qutrit).

In this context, it assumed that only one of the subsystem is accelerated, while the ﬁltering
process is performed on the qubit (small dimension subsystem) or the qutrit (large dimension sub-
system), the qubit. It is shown that, local ﬁltering can increase the upper bounds of entanglement
of the accelerated system. The maximum bounds of entanglement depend on the values of the
acceleration, ﬁlters’ strengths and the dimensions of the subsystem which is accelerated/ﬁltered.
The obtained results show that, for a ﬁxed acceleration of the qubit (small dimension sub-
system), the entanglement of the ﬁltered state increases as the qutrit’s ﬁlter strength increases,
whilst if the qubit is ﬁltered, then the entanglement increases over an interval of the strength
depending on the initial acceleration. However, for larger values of the qubit’s ﬁlter strength,
the entanglement of the large initial accelerations increases. On the other hand, if the qutrit
is accelerated, then the increasing rate of entanglement at ﬁxed values of accelerations is much
larger than that depicted for the previous case (the qubit is accelerated). The larger values of
entanglement’s bounds are drown for larger values of the qutrit’s ﬁlter strength, while they are
seen for smaller values of the qubit’s ﬁlter strength

If the smallest dimension subsystem is accelerated, then the entanglement can not increase its
initial values. One the other hand, for smaller acceleration, the entanglement bounds of the ﬁltered
state are much larger than those compared with a large acceleration. If the smaller dimensional
subsystem is accelerated and ﬁltered, the maximum entanglement of the ﬁltered state depends on

the initial acceleration and the value of the ﬁlter strength. Meanwhile, for accelerated qubit, one
can obtain a long lived entanglement between the accelerated partners, where its upper bounds
always increase as the ﬁlter strength of the qutrit increases.

In conclusion: local ﬁltering can be considered as a resource of purifying the accelerated states,
where it is possible to retrieve the lost entanglement. Local ﬁltering play the same role played
by the weak measurements to improve the entanglement. For noise environment, local ﬁltering
has the ability to retrieve the lost entanglement parabolisticaly, while for accelerated system in
addition to retrieve the lost entanglement, it can increase it. If the smallest dimension subsystem
is accelerated, one can not only recoup the lost entanglement but also a long-lived entanglement
can be generated by ﬁltering the larger dimension subsystem. However, if the largest subsystem
is accelerated, one can in addition to retrieving the lost entanglement, increase the upper bounds
of entanglement by ﬁltering any subsystem (qubit/qutrit).
