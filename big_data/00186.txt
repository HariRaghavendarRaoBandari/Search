CANONICAL MODULES OF COMPLEXES

MARYAM AKHAVIN AND EERO HYRY

Abstract. We deﬁne the notion of the canonical module of a
complex. We then consider Serre’s conditions for a complex and
study their relationship to the local cohomology of the canonical
module and its ring of endomorphisms.

1. Introduction

The notion of the canonical module of a ring is an important tool
in commutative algebra. P. Schenzel deﬁned in [12] the notion of the
canonical module of a module. The canonical module always satisﬁes
Serre’s condition (S2). Schenzel related higher Serre’s conditions to the
vanishing of certain local cohomology modules of the canonical module.
The purpose of this article is to extend these results to complexes. We
utilize the powerful tools of hyperhomological algebra.

Let (R, m) be a Noetherian local ring admitting a dualizing complex.
We work within the derived category Df
b (R) of bounded complexes of
R-modules with ﬁnitely generated homology. Generalizing the work of
Schenzel, we deﬁne for any complex M ∈ Df
b (R) and any i ∈ Z the i-
th module of deﬁciency K i
M by setting K i
M = Hi(RHomR(M, DR),
where DR denotes the dualizing complex of R normalized so that
Hdim R(DR) 6= 0 and Hi(DR) = 0 for i > dim R. The canonical mod-
ule of M is then KM = K dim M
. Note that by local duality the local
cohomology module Hi
In particu-
lar, modules of deﬁciency measure how far the complex is from being
Cohen-Macaulay.

Given k ∈ N, we say that a complex M satisﬁes Serre’s condition

(Sk) if

depthRp Mp ≥ min(k − inf Mp, dim Mp)

for all prime ideals p ∈ Supp M. It is convenient to consider complexes
satisfying the condition dimR M = dimRp Mp + dim R/p for every p ∈
SuppR M. Here Supp M means the homological support of M. It then
follows from our Theorem 4.12 that (Sk) is equivalent to the natural
homomorphism

being bijective for all i ≥ −k + 2, and injective for i = −k + 1. Note
RKM = HomR(KM , KM ). It makes also sense, for any l ∈ Z,
that KM ⊗L

to look at the condition (Sk,l) saying that

depthRp Mp ≥ min(k − l, dim Mp)

for all prime ideals p ∈ Supp M. Observe that (Sk) always implies
(Sk,sup M ). It now turns out in Corollary 4.14 that (Sk,l) is equivalent
to the natural homomorphism Hi(M) → K i+t
being bijective for i ≥
KM
l − k + 2, and injective for i = l − k + 1. In the case M is a module and
l = 0, this reduces to the result of Schenzel mentioned in the beginning.
Finally, we look at the complex M † := RHomR(M, DR). Suppose
If M † satisﬁes Serre’s
that sup M = sup Mp for all p ∈ Supp M.
∼= KHs(M ),
condition (S2), it comes out in Corollary 4.22 that KM
where s = sup M. Combining this with the observation of Lipman,
Nayak and Sastry in [11, Proposition 9.3.5] that the Cousin complex of
a complex depends only on the top homology of M † i.e. on the canonical
module, we can relate the Cousin complex of the complex M to that of
the module Hs(M). More precisely, we show in Proposition 4.24 that
in the above situation

ED(M )(M) ∼= Ps ED(Hs(M ))(Hs(M)),

where D(M) and D(Hs(M)) denote the dimension ﬁltrations of M and
Hs(M) respectively.

2. Preliminaries

The purpose of this section is to ﬁx notation and recall some deﬁni-
tions and results of hyperhomological algebra relevant to this article.
As a general reference, we mention [2] and references therein. For more
details, see also [3], [4], [8] and [9].

In the following R is always a commutative Noetherian ring. If R is
local, then m denotes the maximal ideal and k the residue ﬁeld of R.
Throughout this article we work within the derived category D(R)
of R-modules. We use homological grading so that the objects of D(R)
are complexes of R-modules of the form
di+1→ Mi

di→ Mi−1 . . .

M :

. . .

di−1→ Mi+1

.

The derived category is triangulated, the suspension functor Σ being
deﬁned by the formulas (ΣM)n = Mn−1 and dΣM
n = −dn−1. The symbol
“≃” is reserved for isomorphisms in D(R). We use the subscripts “b”,
“+” and “−” to denote the homological boundness, the homological
boundness from below and the homological boundness from above, re-
spectively. The superscript “f ” denotes the homological ﬁniteness. So
the full subcategory of D(R) consisting of complexes with ﬁnitely gen-
erated homology modules is denoted by Df (R). As usual, we identify
the category of R-modules as the full subcategory of D(R) of complexes
M satisfying Hi(M) = 0 for i 6= 0. For a complex M ∈ D(R), by sup M
and inf M, we mean its homological supremum and inﬁmum. Let M

CANONICAL MODULES OF COMPLEXES

3

and N be complexes of R-modules. We use the standard notations
M ⊗L
R N and RHomR(M, N) for the left derived tensor product com-
plex and the right derived homomomorphism complex, respectively.
Moreover, we set Ext−i

R (M, N) = Hi(RHomR(M, N)) for all i ∈ Z.

The support of a complex M ∈ D(R) is the set

SuppR M = {p ∈ Spec R | Mp 6≃ 0} .

The Krull dimension

dimR M = sup {dim R/p − inf Mp | p ∈ SuppR M } .

If M ∈ D+(R), then dim M ≥ − inf M. For every p ∈ Spec R, there is
an inequality

(1)

dimR M ≥ dimRp Mp + dim R/p.

Also note the formula

(2)

dimR M = sup(cid:8)dimR Hi(M) − i | i ∈ Z(cid:9)

(see [5, Lemma 6.3.5]).

Let M ∈ D+(R). We recall from [4, Deﬁnitions 2.1] that a prime
ideal p ∈ SuppR M is called an anchor prime for M, if dimRp Mp =
− inf Mp. The set of all anchor primes for M is denoted by AncR M.
The anchor primes play the role of minimal primes for complexes. Note
that p ∈ AncR(M), if dim R/p = dimR M + inf Mp.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let (R, m) be a ring, and let M ∈ D+(R). We say
that M is equidimensional, if

AncR(M) = {p ∈ Supp M | dim R/p = dimR M + inf Mp}.

Proposition 2.2. Let (R, m) be a catenary ring, and let M ∈ D+(R).
Then the following conditions are equivalent:

a) M is equidimensional;
b) dimR M = dimRp Mp + dim R/p for every p ∈ SuppR M.

Proof. a) ⇒ b) : Let p ∈ SuppR M. By inequality (1) we have

dimRp Mp ≥ dimRq Mq + dim Rp/qRp

for every qRp ∈ SuppRp Mp. Take now q ∈ Min SuppR M such that
q ⊂ p. Then

dimRp Mp + dim R/p ≥ dimRq Mq + dim Rp/qRp + dim R/p

= dimRq Mq + dim R/q
= − inf Mq + dim R/q
= dimR M.

Here the ﬁrst equality holds true, since R/q is a catenary integral do-
main. The second equality comes from the fact that Min SuppR M ⊂
AncR M (see [4, Theorem 2.3 (a)]). The last equality then follows from

4

MARYAM AKHAVIN AND EERO HYRY

the equidimensionality of M. Since the converse inequality comes from
inequality (1), we are done.
b) ⇒ a) : This is clear, since now

− inf Mp = dimRp Mp = dimR M − dim R/p

for every p ∈ AncR M

(cid:3)

If (R, m) is local and M ∈ D−(R), then the depth of M is deﬁned by
the formula depthR M = − sup RHomR(k, M). One has depthR M ≥
− sup M. Moreover, when M 6≃ 0, the equality holds if and only if
m ∈ AssR Hsup M (M) (see [5, Observation 5.2.5]). If depth M = dim M,
then M is said to be Cohen-Macaulay. For any ring R and M ∈ D−(R),
a prime ideal p ∈ SuppR M is called an associated prime ideal of M
if depthRp Mp = − sup Mp. The set of all associated primes of M is
denoted by AssR M. Furthermore, when M 6≃ 0,

(3)

p ∈ AssR Hsup M (M) if and only if depthRp Mp = − sup M

by [2, A.6.1.2].

If (R, m) is a local ring, the derived local cohomology functor with

respect to m is denoted by RΓm. As usual, we set

Hi

m(−) = H−i(RΓm(−))

for all i ∈ Z. Note that

(4)

and

(5)

− inf RΓm(M) = dimR M

− sup RΓm(M) = depthR M

(see [8, 2.4]).
If R admits a dualizing complex, we denote by DR
the dualizing complex normalized with sup DR = dim R and inf DR =
depth R. The dagger dual of a complex M ∈ Df

b (R) is

M † = RHomR(M, DR).

We obtain a contravariant functor (−)† : Df
b (R). The canon-
ical morphism M → M †† induces the biduality M ≃ M ††, which is
called the dagger duality for M. The local duality says that

b (R) → Df

(6)

RΓm(M) ≃ HomR(M †, ER(k)),

where ER(k) denotes the injective envelope of k. We will frequently
use the formulas

(7)

and

(8)

sup M † = dimR M

inf M † = depth M

CANONICAL MODULES OF COMPLEXES

5

(see [5, Proposition 7.2.7]). By biduality, we then have sup M =
dimR M † and inf M = depthR M †. Also observe that

(9)

(Mp)†p ≃ P− dim R/p(M †)p

for all p ∈ Spec R (see [12, Lemma 1.3.3]). Here the dagger dual on
the left-hand side is taken with respect to the normalized dualizing
complex of the localization Rp.

Proposition 2.3. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex, and let M ∈ Df
b (R). Then the following statements are equivalent:

a) M † is equidimensional;
b) sup M = sup Mp for any p ∈ SuppR M.

Proof. We know by Proposition 2.2 and formula (7) that M † being
equidimensional is equivalent to

dimRp(M †)p = − dim R/p + sup M

for every p ∈ SuppR M. On the other hand, by using formula (9) we
get

dimRp(M †)p = − dim R/p + dimRp(Mp)†p

= − dim R/p + sup Mp,

where the last equality comes from formula (7). So a) and b) are
equivalent.
(cid:3)

3. Modules of deficiency of a complex

We extend the deﬁnition given by P. Schenzel in [12, p. 62] to the

case of complexes:

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex, and let M ∈ Df
M = Hi(M †). The
modules K i
M are called the modules of deﬁciency of the complex M.
Moreover, we set KM = K dimR M
, and say that KM is the canonical
module of M.

b (R). For every i ∈ Z, set K i

M

Remark 3.2. Obviously, the modules of deﬁciency are ﬁnitely gener-
ated. Using formulas (7) and (8), we get

and

depthR M = inf{i ∈ Z | K i

M 6= 0}

dimR M = sup{i ∈ Z | K i

M 6= 0}.

Note also that by local duality Hi
i ∈ Z.

m(M) ∼= HomR(K i

M , ER(k)) for all

6

MARYAM AKHAVIN AND EERO HYRY

Example 3.3. Any ﬁnitely generated module is a canonical module of
a complex. Indeed, if K is a ﬁnitely generated R-module and t ∈ Z,

set M = P−t K †. Since dimR M = t by formula (7), it now follows by

biduality that

KM = Ht(Pt K) = K.

Lemma 3.4. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing complex,
and let M ∈ Df

M )p

a) (K i
b) If p ∈ SuppR M with dimR M = dimRp Mp + dim R/p, then

for every p ∈ SuppR M;

Proof. a) Using formula (9) we get

b) Part a) immediately implies that

)p = (KM )p.

(cid:3)

Our next aim is to investigate the associated primes of modules of

deﬁciency. From now on we set

for every X ⊂ Spec R and all i ∈ Z.

(X)i = (cid:8)p ∈ X | dim R/p = i(cid:9)

Lemma 3.5. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing complex,
and let M ∈ Df
b (R). Then the following statements hold for all i ∈ Z:
a) dimR K i
M ≤ i + sup M;
b) (AssR K i−s
M )i = (AssR Hs(M))i where s = sup M;
c) (AssR KM )i = (AssR Hi−dimR M (M))i.

Proof. a) Using formula (2) we have

dimR M † = sup(cid:8)dimR K i
M ≤ i + dimR M †. This implies the claim, because

M − i | i ∈ Z(cid:9).

Therefore dimR K i
dimR M † = sup M by formula (7).
b) By a) we have dimR K i−s

M ≤ i. Hence,

(AssR K i−s
It is then enough to prove that
(SuppR K i−s

M )i = (SuppR K i−s

M )i.

M )i = (AssR Hs(M))i.

Take ﬁrst p ∈ (SuppR K i−s
M )i. Then K −s
fore Hs(RΓpRp(Mp)) 6= 0 implying that

Mp 6= 0 by Lemma 3.4 a). There-

s ≤ sup RΓpRp(Mp).

CANONICAL MODULES OF COMPLEXES

7

On the other hand, we have

sup RΓpRp(Mp) = − depthRp Mp

by formula (5). It now follows that

s ≤ sup RΓpRp(Mp) = − depthRp Mp ≤ sup Mp ≤ s.

Therefore, − depthRp Mp = s = sup Mp. By formula (3) this means
that p ∈ AssR Hs(M). So

(SuppR K i−s

M )i ⊂ (AssR Hs(M))i.

Conversely, let p ∈ (AssR Hs(M))i. Then depthRp Mp = −s by for-
Mp 6= 0. By
M )p 6= 0. Thus p ∈ SuppR K i−s
M .

mula (3). Hence − sup RΓpRp(Mp) = −s implying that K −s
Lemma 3.4 a) this means that (K i−s
Therefore

(AssR Hs(M))i ⊂ (SuppR K i−s

M )i.

c) This follows by applying b) to M †, because KM † ∼= Hs(M) by for-
mula (7).

(cid:3)

We can now identify the set of the associated primes and the support

of the canonical module of a complex.

Proposition 3.6. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex, and let M ∈ Df

b (R). Then

a)
AssR KM = {p ∈ SuppR M | dim R/p = dimR M + inf Mp};

b)
SuppR KM = {p ∈ SuppR M | dimR M = dimRp Mp + dim R/p}.

Proof. a) Let p ∈ SuppR M. We apply formula (3) to M †. Because
sup M † = dimR M by formula (7), it thus follows that p ∈ AssR KM if
and only if depthRp(M †)p = − dimR M. Using formulas (9) and (7) we
get

depthRp(M †)p = depthRp(Mp)†p − dim R/p

= inf Mp − dim R/p.

Hence p ∈ AssR KM if and only if

inf Mp − dim R/p = − dimR M.

This proves the claim.
b) Let p ∈ SuppR KM . Note ﬁrst that SuppR M † = SuppR M. Indeed,
SuppR M † ⊂ SuppR M, which implies by biduality that SuppR M ⊂
SuppR M †. Since SuppR KM ⊂ SuppR M †, we then have p ∈ SuppR M.
Take q ∈ AssR KM such that q ⊂ p. Now

dimRp Mp ≥ height p/q − inf Mq = dim R/q − dim R/p − inf Mq,

8

MARYAM AKHAVIN AND EERO HYRY

where the ﬁrst inequality is clear by the deﬁnition of Krull dimension
and the subsequent equality holds true, since R/q is a catenary integral
domain. Because

dim R/q = dimR M + inf Mq

by a), this shows that

dimR M ≤ dim R/p + dimRp Mp.

Taking into account inequality (1), we get

dimR M = dim R/p + dimRp Mp.

Suppose then that the above equality holds for p ∈ SuppR M. By
∼= KMp 6= 0. Thus p ∈ SuppR KM , and
Lemma 3.4 b) we have (KM )p
we are done.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.7. We observe that by Proposition 3.6 a) and Lemma 3.5
c)

{p ∈ SuppR M | dim R/p = dimR M+ inf Mp}

(AssR Hi(M))i+dimR M .

= [i∈Z

Corollary 3.8. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex, and let M ∈ Df
b (R). Set t = dimR M and s = sup M. Then
dimR KM = s + t if and only if dimR Hs(M) = s + t.
Proof. By Lemma 3.5 a) dimR KM ≤ s + t. Since Hs(M) ∼= KM †, we
also hava dimR Hs(M) ≤ s + t. Because

(AssR KM )s+t = (AssR Hs(M))s+t

by Lemma 3.5 b), the claim follows.

(cid:3)

4. Main results

We want to generalize Serre’s conditions to complexes. It is conve-

nient to begin with the following very general deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let R be a ring. Let k ∈ Z and N ∈ Df
that a complex M ∈ Df

b (R) satisﬁes Serre’s condition (Sk,N ), if

b (R). We say

depthRp RHomRp(Np, Mp) ≥ min(cid:8)k, dimRp Mp + inf Np(cid:9)

for all p ∈ Spec R.

Remark 4.2. Since

depthRp RHomRp(Np, Mp) = inf Np + depthRp Mp

CANONICAL MODULES OF COMPLEXES

9

for all p ∈ Spec R by [7, Proposition 4.6] it is clear that (Sk,N ) is
equivalent to having

depthRp Mp ≥ min(cid:8)k − inf Np, dimRp Mp(cid:9)

for all p ∈ Spec R.

The following proposition is now immediate:

Proposition 4.3. Let R be a ring. Let k ∈ Z and N ∈ Df
b (R). Then
a complex M ∈ Df
b (R) satisﬁes the condition (Sk,N ), if and only if Mp
is Cohen-Macaulay for every p ∈ Spec R with depthRp Mp < k − inf Np.

Notation 4.4. If N = M or N = Pl R for some l ∈ Z, we will

speak about the condition (Sk) or (Sk,l), respectively. In other words,
the complex M satisﬁes (Sk) if and only if

for all p ∈ Spec R. Similarly, M is said to satisfy (Sk,l) if

depthRp Mp ≥ min(cid:8)k − inf Mp, dimRp Mp(cid:9)
depthRp Mp ≥ min(cid:8)k − l, dimRp Mp(cid:9)

for all p ∈ Spec R.
Remark 4.5. Let R be a ring, and let M ∈ Df
b (R). Since dimRp Mp ≥
inf Mp for all p ∈ Supp M, the condition (Sk) holds trivially for k ≤ 0.
Moreover, as inf Mp ≤ sup Mp ≤ sup M , we see that (Sk) always
implies (Sk,sup M ).

Remark 4.6. Note that our (Sk) diﬀers from the condition given by
Celikbas and Piepmeyer in [1, 2.4] according to which a complex M ∈
Df

b (R) satisﬁes (Sk) if

depthRp Mp + inf Mp ≥ min {k, height p}

for every p ∈ SuppR M. However, because

dimRp Mp ≤ height p − inf Mp

by [5, Observation 6.3.3], we observe that the condition of Celikbas and
Piepmeyer implies our (Sk).

Given an integer n, recall that the soft truncation of a complex M

above at n is the complex

M⊂n : . . . → 0 → Coker dn+1 → Mn−1 → Mn−2 → . . .

.

In D(R) we now have an exact triangle

(10)

Pn Hn(M) → M⊂n → M⊂n−1 → Pn+1 Hn(M).

Note that if n ≥ sup M, then the natural morphism M → M⊂n be-
comes an isomorphism in D(R).

The next deﬁnition was given for modules by P. Schenzel in [14,

Deﬁnition 4.1].

10

MARYAM AKHAVIN AND EERO HYRY

Deﬁnition 4.7. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex, and let M ∈ Df
b (R). We call the complex (M †)⊂dimR M −1 as the
complex of deﬁciency of M, and denote it by CM .

Remark 4.8. Clearly

if i ≤ dimR M − 1;
otherwise.

In particular, when M 6≃ 0, we have CM ≃ 0 if and only if M is
Cohen-Macaulay. If this is not the case, then inf CM = depth M.

Remark 4.9. Because sup M † = dim M by formula (7), we obtain an
exact triangle

An application of the functor (−)† to (12) yields an exact triangle

c) sup RHomR(N, C †

M ≤ i + j − k for all i, j ∈ Z, j < dimR M.

Proof. a) ⇔ b) : Let p ∈ Spec R. We want to show that the conditions

depthRp Mp ≥ min(cid:8)k − inf Np, dimRp Mp(cid:9)

and inf CMp ≥ k − inf Np are equivalent.
If Mp is Cohen-Macaulay,
this is clear. Suppose thus that Mp is not Cohen-Macaulay. We may
assume that Mp 6≃ 0. By Remark 4.8 the latter condition now means

CANONICAL MODULES OF COMPLEXES

11

that depthRp Mp ≥ k − inf Np. But because depthRp Mp < dimRp Mp,
this implies the desired equivalence.

b) ⇔ c) : It is enough to observe that by [5, Lemma 7.2.7], Lemma 4.10

and formula (8) we have

− sup RHomR(N, C †

Since HomR(KM , KM ) 6= 0, it follows from formula (7) and [2, Propo-
sition A.4.6] that

dim M ⊗L

R KM = sup RHomR(KM , M †) = sup M † − inf KM = dim M.
An application of the functor RHomR(KM , −) on (12), yields the exact
triangle

P−t−1 RHomR(KM , CM ) → RHomR(KM , KM )

→ P−t RHomR(KM , M †)

→ P−t RHomR(KM , CM ).

The desired isomorphism now follows from the corresponding long ex-
act sequence of homology, because sup RHomR(KM , CM ) ≤ sup CM
by [2, Proposition A.4.6].

Let us then consider the conditions (Sk,l).

Corollary 4.14. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex. Let k, l ∈ Z and M ∈ Df
b (R). Set t = dimR M. If M is equidi-
mensional, then the following conditions are equivalent:

a) M satisﬁes (Sk,l);
b) The natural homomorphism Hi(M) → K i+t
KM

l − k + 2, and injective for i = l − k + 1;

c) The natural homomorphism

is bijective for i ≥

Hi+t

m (KM ) → HomR(Hi(M), ER(k))

is bijective for i ≥ l − k + 2, and surjective for i = l − k + 1.

Proof. The equivalence of a) and b) follows immediately from Theo-

rem 4.12 by taking N = Pl R whereas the homomorphism of c) is by

local duality the Matlis-dual of that of b).

(cid:3)

If R is a ring and N is an R-module, we use the notation

AsshR N = {p ∈ SuppR N | dim R/p = dimR N}.

Corollary 4.15. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex. Let M ∈ Df
b (R) be an equidimensional complex. Set t = dimR M
and s = sup M. If M satisﬁes Serre’s condition (S1), then

a) dimR Hs(M) = dimR KM = s + t;
b) AssR Hs(M) = AsshR Hs(M).

is injective. Then K s+t
KM

Proof. a) Recall that (S1) implies S1,s. By Corollary 4.14 the natural
homomorphism Hs(M) → K s+t
6= 0 so that
KM
by Lemma 3.5 a) we must have dimR KM = s + t. It now follows from
Corollary 3.8 that dim Hs(M) = s + t, too.
b) Because dimR Hs(M) = s + t by a), it is enough to show that
AssR Hs(M) = (AssR Hs(M))s+t. By a) we also have an injective ho-
momorphism Hs(M) → KKM . So

AssR Hs(M) ⊂ AssR KKM = (AssR KM )s+t,

where the last equality comes from [14, Proposition 2.3 b)]. Since
(AssR KM )s+t = (AssR Hs(M))s+t by Lemma 3.5 b), we get

AssR Hs(M) = (AssR Hs(M))s+t

as wanted.

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.16. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex. Let M ∈ Df
b (R) be an equidimensional complex. If M satisﬁes
Serre’s condition (S2), then

HomD(R)(M, M) ∼= HomR(KM , KM )

∼= KHs(M ).

and Hs(M) ∼= KKM . Moreover, if KM is equidimensional and satisﬁes
Serre’s condition (S2), then KM
Proof. Recall ﬁrst that HomD(R)(M, M) ∼= Ext0
R(M, M). The desired
isomorphism HomD(R)(M, M)) ∼= HomR(KM , KM ) then comes from
Theorem 4.12 by taking N = M and Proposition 4.13 whereas Corol-
lary 4.14 and Corollary 4.15 a) provide the isomorphism Hs(M) →
KKM . Combining the latter with [13, Theorem 1.14 (ii)], shows that
KHs(M )
(cid:3)

∼= KKKM

∼= KM .

We now turn to look at the dagger dual:

Proposition 4.17. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing
complex, and let M ∈ Df
b (R). The complex M † satisﬁes Serre’s condi-
tion (Sk) if and only if sup Mp = inf Mp for every p ∈ SuppR M with
depth Mp + inf Mp < k.

Proof. Note ﬁrst that by using formula (9) together with formulas (7)
and (8) we get

and

dimRp(M †)p = − dim R/p + sup Mp

depthRp(M †)p = − dim R/p + inf Mp.

14

MARYAM AKHAVIN AND EERO HYRY

We also have

inf(M †)p = dim R/p + inf M †p

p = dim R/p + depthRp Mp.

The claim then follows from Proposition 4.3.

(cid:3)

In order to apply Theorem 4.12 in this case, we need

Lemma 4.18. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing complex,
and let M ∈ Df
R(M, M) for all i ∈ Z.

R(M †, M †) ∼= Exti

b (R). Then Exti

Proof. By ‘swap’ (see [2, A.4.22]) and dagger duality

RHomR(M †, M †) ≃ RHomR(M, M ††) ≃ RHomR(M, M).

The claim now follows by taking the homology.

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.19. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex. Let k ∈ Z and M ∈ Df
b (R). Set s = sup M. If M † is equidimen-
sional, then the following statements are equivalent:

a) M † satisﬁes condition (Sk);
b) The natural homomorphism Ext−i

R (M, M) → K i+s

RHomR(Hs(M ),M )

is bijective for all i ≥ −k + 2, and injective for i = −k + 1.

Proof. Note that dimR M † = s by formula (7). By dagger duality
KM † = Hs(M). By adjointness and biduality we then get

(M † ⊗L

R KM †)† ≃ RHomR(KM †, M ††) ≃ RHomR(Hs(M), M).

The claim is then a direct consequence of Lemma 4.18 and Theo-
rem 4.12.
(cid:3)

In a similar way, Corollary 4.14 yields

Corollary 4.20. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex, k, l ∈ Z and let M ∈ Df
b (R). Set s = sup M. If M † is equidimen-
sional, then the following conditions are equivalent:

a) M † satisﬁes Serre’s condition (Sk,l);
b) The natural homomorphism K i

M → K i+s
l − k + 2, and injective for i = l − k + 1;

Hs(M ) is bijective for i ≥

c) The natural homomorphism Hi+s

m (Hs(M)) → Hi

m(M) is bijec-

tive for i ≥ l − k + 2, and surjective for i = l − k + 1.

Corollary 4.15 and Corollary 4.16 have now the following analogues:

Corollary 4.21. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex and let M ∈ Df
b (R). Suppose that M † is equidimensional. Set
t = dimR M and s = sup M. If M † satisﬁes Serre’s condition (S1),
then

a) dimR Hs(M) = dimR KM = s + t;
b) AssR KM = AsshR KM .

Corollary 4.22. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing com-
plex, and let M ∈ Df
b (R). Suppose that M † is equidimensional. Set
s = sup M. If M † satisﬁes Serre’s condition (S2), then
HomD(R)(M, M) ∼= HomR(Hs(M), Hs(M))

∼= KHs(M ). Moreover, if Hs(M) is equidimensional and satis-

and KM
ﬁes Serre’s condition (S2), then Hs(M) ∼= KKM .

Let R be a ring. Recall that a ﬁltration of Spec R is a descending

sequence

F :

. . . ⊇ F i−1 ⊇ F i ⊇ F i+1 ⊇ . . .

of subsets of Spec R such that Ti F i = ∅, F i = Spec R for some i ∈ Z

and each p ∈ F i \ F i+1 is a minimal element of F i with respect to
inclusion. Let EF (M) denote the Cousin complex corresponding to a
complex M ∈ Df

b (R). Recall that EF (M) is a complex

with

. . . → EF (M)i → EF (M)i−1 → . . .

EF (M)i = Mp∈F −i\F −i+1

H−i

pRp(Mp).

Observe that we here grade the Cousin complex homologically in con-
trary to the general tradition. For more details about Cousin complexes
we refer to [11, Chapter IV, §3]. Note that if M is an R-module, then
the Cousin complex studied by Sharp (see [15], for example) is a com-
plex

0 → M → EF (M)0 → EF (M)−1 → . . .

A standard example of a ﬁltration is the “M-dimension ﬁltration”
D(M) deﬁned by the formula

Di(M) = {p ∈ Spec R | i ≤ dim M − dim R/p}

for all i ∈ Z.

The following result is proved by Lipman, Nayak and Sastry in [11,
Proposition 9.3.5]. Similar results have been proved in the module
case by Dibaei and Tousi in [6, Theorem 1.4] and by Kawasaki in [10,
Theorem 5.4].

Proposition 4.23. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing
complex, and let M ∈ Df

b (R). Then

We can now use this to prove

ED(M )(M) ∼= P− dimR M K †

M .

Proposition 4.24. Let (R, m) be a local ring admitting a dualizing
complex, and let M ∈ Df
b (R). Set s = sup M. If M † is equidimensional
and satisﬁes Serre’s condition (S2), then

ED(M )(M) ∼= Ps ED(Hs(M ))(Hs(M)).
