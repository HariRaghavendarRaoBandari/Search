Based on the nonperturbative analysis, we show that the classical motion of harmonic oscillator
derived from the deformed QM is manifestly in contradiction with observations. For this reason, we
take an alternate way for estimating the eﬀect and discuss its possible observational manifestations
in macrophysics.

Motivated by the paper [1] (see also [2]), suggesting a
way for observing the Planck length deformed QM via
the optomechanical experiments, we take an attempt to
discuss further this question. This paper provides the
possible experimental basis for observing the corrections
to the QM, say, of the form (we employ units in which:
c =  = 1)

X(cid:17) ,
hbX,bPXi = i(cid:16)1 + ßbP 2

(1)

by the interference eﬀect when the part of the light en-
tering the optomechanical device is subject to the os-
cillation of the moving mirror-wall of the device, under
assumption that the latter undergoes ”quantum motion”
with respect to the modiﬁed prescription (1). In Eq.(1)
ß ≃ l2
P , where lP (≃ 10−33cm) is the Planck length. It
it naturally expected that the gravitational corrections
to the processes probing the length scale ℓ(≫ lP ) should
be suppressed by some powers of the ratio lP /ℓ [3]. The
Eq.(1) can be interpreted in much the same way. Namely,
one may hold that because of quantum ﬂuctuations of the
background metric - any length scale, ℓ ≫ lP , acquires
uncertainty that on the general grounds can be parame-
terized as: ≃ lα
P ℓ1−α. Hence the position uncertainty of
the particle gets increased, δx → δx+ ßα/2δx1−α, leading
.

to the modiﬁed uncertainty relation δxδp & 1+(cid:16)√ßδp(cid:17)α

The Eq.(1) corresponds to the speciﬁc case: α = 2. An-
other case of interest might be: α = 1/2 [4]. We take
this judgment as a guiding principle for our further dis-
cussion. It can be stated simply as follows: the size of the
gravitational corrections depends primarily on the length
scale probed by the system.

Returning to the discussion of [1, 2], the system under
consideration consists of a monochromatic electromag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁned in a mirror box - one of the walls
of which is vibrating non-relativistically. The vibrating
wall, which is assumed to be parallel to the (Y, Z) plane,
is moving along the X axis. This system can be modeled
by the Hamiltonian

mω2bX 2

− gba +babX ,

where the three-dimensional momentum P (instead of
the one-dimensional one) is introduced purely for techni-
cal convenience, ωph is the photon frequency and ω and

bH = ωphba +ba + bP 2
bX stand for the vibrating mirror-wall frequency and po-

sition operator, respectively1. The coupling parameter
g can be elucidated in terms of input parameters in the
following way. Because of photon gas pressure, which is
equal to the one third of the photon gas energy density,
under assumption that the amplitude of mirror vibrations
is much smaller then the cavity length, that is, X ≪ l,
there is in fact a constant force acting in outward direc-
tion on the moving wall

FX =

ωphnphs

3ls

,

where s denotes its surface area and l stands for the cav-
ity length. Hence the coupling parameter: g = ωph/3l.

One can construct a particular representation for the

1−α

deformed bX,bY ,bZ, bP operators in terms of the standard
position and momentum operators, bx,by,bz, bp, for an ar-
bitrary α (α 6= 1) [4]: bX = bx,bY = by,bZ = bz,
bP = bph1 − (α − 1)(cid:0)ßbp2(cid:1)α/2i 1

When α = 2, one arrives at a well known result of [7].
It is worth noticing that the case α > 1 (α < 1) cor-
responds to the assumption that the length ﬂuctuation
δℓ = ßα/2ℓ1−α decreases (increases) with increasing of ℓ.
A speciﬁc feature for the deformed QM with α > 1 is that
in this case the state vectors are represented by the cutoﬀ
Fourier representation2, but it is less important for us as
we are dealing with the objects having the localization
with much greater than the Planck length.

The equations for by(t) and bz(t) have plainly the same
form as Eq.(5) with bpx replaced by bpy and bpz, respec-
tively. The solution forba(t) can immediately be written
dτbx(τ ) .
ba(t) = ba(0) exp−iωpht + ig

Let us now specify the initial state of the system. For
this purpose, we take the coherent state for the photon

Let us notice that by adding a linear term to the poten-
tial of oscillator - the potential has still the pure oscilla-
tor form with the equilibrium position shifted. So, this
term in Eq.(9) can merely be dropped as in the paper [9].
The question of experimental detection can be addressed
merely by measuring the velocity ˙x for x = 0. The con-
servation of energy allows one to estimate the value of
momentum px for x = 0,

and then by substituting this value of px in (8) - to deter-
mine the velocity at this point. It is almost obvious that
the deviation from the standard velocity becomes appre-
ciable when the momentum approaches ß−1/2 (Planck en-
ergy scale). Let us consider two speciﬁc cases α = 2 and
α = 1/2. In the former case, assuming |px| is approach-
ing ß−1/2 (|px| < ß−1/2) and usig Eq.(10), one obtains
for the velocity at x = 0

position and momentum operators.

Now let us turn to the case α = 1/2. With no loss of
generality, we can absorb the factor 1 − α in ßα/2 (for
ß is deﬁned up to the numerical factor of order unity).

Then under assumption ßp2

x ≃ 1 at x = 0, from Eq.(10)

For characterizing the size of the eﬀect - it might be useful
to look at the ratio | ˙x|/ωxmax, which in the standard case
is equal to 1. Such a big deviation at the macroscopic
scales is not natural4 that leads to the opinion to revise
the whole discussion from the very outset.

For this purpose, let us look at the well known QM
description of the classical motion of harmonic oscillator
[10]. The wave function

corresponds to the minimum uncertainty state: δx =

It is plain to see that: px(t) = hψ(t)|bpx|ψ(t)i, x(t) =
hψ(t)|bx|ψ(t)i. On the other hand, this wave function
1/√2mω, δpx = pmω/2. The classicality of motion

means that the quantum ﬂuctuations should be smaller
as compared to the classical quantities. It is convenient
to characterize the degree of classicality in terms of the
energy

Therefore, the motion is essentially classical if n ≫ 1.
This discussion tells us that there is an oscillating par-
ticle localized within the region δx ∼ 1/√mω and for

estimating the gravitational corrections to this system
with respect to physics underlying the Eq.(1), one has
to use this length scale and look for the corrections in
the form (lP /δx)2. So that, the size of the gravitational
correction depends primarily on δx. Certainly, the mov-
ing mirror in optomechanical device with the parameters
given in [1], m ≃ MP , ω ≃ 105Hz, is not localized within
the region 1/√MP ω ∼ 10−14cm but for the moment let
us forget about it and ask what might be the size of the
gravitational corrections to the classical oscillator in the
framework of the above discussion. As it was discussed in
the beginning of the paper, because of ﬂuctuating back-
ground the oscillator gets modiﬁed in such a way as to
respect the modiﬁed uncertainty relation

2n1 + (cid:16)√ß/δx(cid:17)αo =

for the problem under consideration δx is constant. Thus,
we are just saying that the momentum for oscillating par-
ticle, which is localized within the region δx, is increased

δxδpx ≥
Let us continue in the spirit of the previous discussion
and ascribe this modiﬁcation to the momentum opera-

tor: bpx → bpxh1 + (cid:16)√ß/δx(cid:17)αi. It makes sense because
by the factor: 1 +(cid:16)√ß/δx(cid:17)α

In the case when the localization width of the oscillating
body, ℓ, is much bigger than δx = 1/√2mω, one could
make a straightforward generalization of this result

4 This point can easily be missed in the framework of perturbative

treatment [9] the validity of which requires (cid:0)ßp

≪ 1.

x(t) = x(0) cos(cid:16)h1 + (cid:16)√ß/ℓ(cid:17)αi ωt(cid:17) .

Obviously, it is extremely hard to detect such a deviation
from standard picture for the realistic input parameters.
Even if one takes an extreme value: ℓ ∼ 10−8cm, the
becomes ∼ 10−12 for α = 1/2

correction term (cid:16)√ß/ℓ(cid:17)α

and ∼ 10−50 for α = 2.

Summarizing, we see that a classical motion derived
from the nonperturbative treatment of quantum oscilla-
tor on the basis of deformed QM (1) is almost obviously
in conﬂict with ”macrophysics”. This point has already
been stressed in [8], in the framework of somewhat dif-
ferent nonperturbatie analysis, and also indicated in [11]

underlies the (1) leads to the result that hardly can be
