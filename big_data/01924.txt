In this paper a role of many-nucleon dynamics in formation of the compound 5Li nucleus in the
scattering of protons oﬀ α-particles at the proton incident energies up to 20 MeV is investigated.
We propose a bremsstrahlung model allowing to extract information about probabilities of forma-
tion of such nucleus on the basis of analysis of experimental cross-sections of the bremsstrahlung
photons. In order to realize this approach, the model includes elements of microscopic theory and
also probabilities of formation of the short-lived compound nucleus. Results of calculations of the
bremsstrahlung spectra are in good agreement with the experimental cross-sections.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding of nuclear interactions between nucleons is hot topic of physics.

In such a line, bremsstrahlung
photons emitted during nuclear reactions provide important information about dynamics of nucleons of composed
nuclear system, which is formed on the basis of interactions. The bremsstrahlung of the emitted photons in nuclear
reactions where nuclei are described on the microscopic level, has been studied for a long time [1–13].
In such
frameworks, bremsstrahlung photons are successfully applied for deeper understanding of nucleon-nucleon interactions.
The nucleon-nucleon scattering data (for example, Nijmegen data set [14]) and properties of the deuteron are used
for controlling parameters of the microscopical cluster models.

A crucial point in description of scattering properties is accurate (precise) determination of wave functions for
scattering states of the nuclear system. In their determination, scattering theory and theory of nuclear reactions have
traditional way, where nuclei from lightest up to super-heavy are included into consideration. In such a frameworks,
interactions between the scattering objects are described often in potential approach, which parameters are extracted
from existed experimental data. Classical objects for study here are eﬀects of collective motion, strong quantum
phenomena, processes of fusion and breakup inside the nuclear system, etc.

Results of such a work are used as a basis for construction of other bremsstrahlung models in nuclear physics.
Our bremsstrahlung model is developed along such a line [15–27]. According to its logic, determination of the
wave functions for the scattering states is quantum mechanical task with interacting potentials, that allows to keep
maximally accurate quantum eﬀect (that can be interesting in cases where they are strong, for example, see [28]).
As attractive point of such a line, inverse scattering theory [29] can be naturally added, to achieve exact coincidence
between experimental and calculated cross-sections (that provides information about the corresponding potentials).
Our approach was successfully tested on set of tasks where experimental data on the emission of the bremsstrahlung
photons in nuclear reactions is essentially larger. These are experimental data for α-decay [17, 18, 30–34] (see also
some calculations [35–49]), scattering of protons oﬀ nuclei [50–59] (see also reviews on situation in such a research
[60, 61]), spontaneous ﬁssion [62–68], etc. (see also predicted spectra for emission of protons from nuclei [23, 25, 26, 69],
ternary ﬁssion [24]).

So, all existed variety of experimental data of emission of the bremsstrahlung photons in nuclear reactions can be

separated into two following groups. To the ﬁrst group one can include the data [70–73], analyzed in the microscopic
cluster models developed formalism of resonating group method [74–76] and generator coordinate method [77]. Such
a data are obtained in the coplanar geometry, where maxima in the bremsstrahlung cross-sections are observed at
some energies (i.e. resonances). Usually, such maxima are explained by resonant states of the compound nuclear
system. In frameworks of such a formalism, kinematic relations between energy of the emitted photon and energy of
relative motion of two nuclei or nucleus and nucleon are applied.

The experimental data of the second group are obtained relatively energy of the emitted photons (here, in calcula-
tions usually kinematic relations between energy of the emitted photons and energy of relative motion between two
nuclei or nucleus and nucleon are not imposed). Such cross-sections are obtained in the large regions of energy, they
have smooth continuous shapes where any sharp resonant peaks are not observed. However, potentials of interactions
usually do not include explicitly such resonant states of the compound nuclear system at deﬁnite energies. Absence of
the ﬁxed dependence between the energy of the emitted photons and the energy of the relative motion between two
nuclei or nucleus and nucleon is justiﬁed by that such experimental bremsstrahlung cross-sections for diﬀerent types
of nuclear decays and the scattering of protons oﬀ nuclei at ﬁxed incident proton energy are continuous, usually have
no resonant peaks and are presented inside enough large region of the emitted photon energy. In description of such
an experimental data our approach proves oneself enough accurate (successfully). From such a point of view, it could
be interesting for us to investigate the experimental data of the ﬁrst group on the basis of our formalism. We see that
understanding of the nuclear interactions on the basis of many nucleon forces, is one of the most important tasks in
nuclear physics. Therefore, in order to base possibility to study the interactions between nucleons in our formalism,
we include some elements of the microscopic theory into it. These ideas represent a main aim of this paper.

Another attractive advance of our approach is possibility to include into operator of emission the additional terms,
connected spinor properties of nucleons with their momenta (i.e. possibility to study inﬂuence of dynamics and spins
of nucleons (their interference) on the emission of photons). Such corrections are appeared in result of many-nucleon
generalization of Dirac equation and the corresponding hamiltonian of the nuclear system (where the ﬁrst approxi-
mation is many-nucleon Pauli equation, see [25] for details). So, thy have another origin than appearance of the spin
states in the resonating group method and the generator coordinate method. In particular, in frameworks of such
a model [26], we explain the hump-shaped plateau in the intermediate and high energy regions of the experimental
bremsstrahlung data [59] by essential presence of the incoherent emission (formed by interactions between the scatter-
ing proton and nucleus with the internal many-nucleon structure) for the scattering of p+208 Pb at the proton incident
energies of 140 and 145 MeV, and the scattering of p +12 C, p +58 Ni, p +107 Ag and p +197 Au at the proton incident
energy of 190 MeV, while at low energies the coherent emission (formed by interaction between the scattering proton
and nucleus as a whole without internal many-nucleon structure) predominates which produces the logarithmic shape
spectrum. Such an approach allows to develop theory for description of the bremsstrahlung photons emitted in the
nuclear reactions in the relativistic region of energies.

Else one useful advance of our model is description of quantum eﬀects shown during fusion and break-up processes
inside the compound nuclear system. According to [28], quantum eﬀects participating in capture of the α particle
by the 40Ca and 44Ca nuclei, are not small, and inclusion of their description into the model allows to essentially
improve agreement between the calculated spectra and experimental data (this method found new parametrization of
the α–nucleus potential and fusion probabilities and decreased the error by 41.72 times for α +40 Ca and 34.06 times
for α +44 Ca in a description of experimental data [78] in comparison with previously existing results). From this point
of view, it could be interesting to include ideas of such a formalism of the processes of fusion and breakup into the
bremsstrahlung model. But, in order to include formalism of many-nucleon interactions, we draw attention on one
of light systems, which were studied previously and for which the experimental data exists. This is the scattering of
protons oﬀ the α-particles, for which the bremsstrahlung cross-sections were measured in the coplanar geometry [70].
Here, suitable object for investigations of processes of nuclear formation and breakup is the system from ﬁve nucleons
in form of the short-lived 5Li nucleus. Analysis of such a task is also included into our research in this paper.

In Sec. II, our improved bremsstrahlung model applied for the scattering of protons oﬀ alpha-particles is presented.
Here, after formulating of operator of emission of bremsstrahlung photons for such a nuclear system, emphasis is
made on construction of formalism for the matrix elements in the microscopic approach, with next application of the
multipolar expansion for wave function of photons and obtaining the bremsstrahlung cross-sections. In Sec. III we
perform theoretical analysis of the bremsstrahlung emission in this reaction. Here, after analysis of phase shifts of
the scattering wave functions obtained in our approach and comparing them with empirical data [79], we calculate
contributions of the emitted photons from diﬀerent transitions between states, obtain the full bremsstrahlung spectrum
comparing it with experimental data [70] of Arndt, Roper, and Shotwell, and calculations of Liu, Tang and Kanada [4],
and Dohet-Eraly [12]. Concluding remarks are presented in Sec. IV. Calculations of one-nucleon space matrix elements
over bound states of nucleus are added in Appendixes A and B, for convenience.

II. MODEL

A. Operator of emission and wave function of the proton - nucleus system

We shall start from the leading form Eq. (7) of the photon emission operator ˆHγ in [26, 27], generalizing it for the
system of the scattering proton and nucleus composed of A nucleons in the laboratory system. Using presentation for
the vector potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in form (5) in [25], we obtain

Here, star denotes complex conjugation, zj and mj are the electromagnetic charge and mass of the nucleon with
number j, mp is mass of proton, pj = −i¯h d/drj is the momentum operator for the nucleon with number j (we number
nucleons of the nucleus by index j). e(α) are unit vectors of the polarization of the photon emitted [e(α),∗ = e(α)], k

We have two independent polarizations e(1) and e(2) for the photon with momentum k (α = 1, 2). In this paper we
shall use the system of units where ¯h = 1 and c = 1.

is the wave vector of the photon and wph = kc = (cid:12)(cid:12)k(cid:12)(cid:12) c. Vectors e(α) are perpendicular to k in the Coulomb gauge.
Now we turn to the center-of-mass frame. We deﬁne coordinate of centers of masses for the nucleus as RA and
for the complete system as R having form RA = PA
j=1 mj rAj /mA, R = (mARA + mprp)/(mA + mp), where
mp and mA are masses of the scattering proton and nucleus.
Introducing new relative coordinates ρAj and r as
rj = RA+ρAj, r = rp−RA, we ﬁnd the corresponding momenta pj = PA+˜pAj, p = pp−PA, where pp = − i¯h d/drp,
PA = − i¯h d/dRA, ˜pAj = −i¯h d/dρAj. Using these formulas, we obtain

where we introduced cA = mA

and cp = mp

. Substituting these expressions to eq. (1), we ﬁnd

RA = R − cp r, rp = R + cA r, rj = R − cp r + ρAj,

ψλs(s) = ϕns (rs)(cid:12)(cid:12) σ(s)τ (s)(cid:11),

We shall assume Φ¯s(R) = e−i K¯s·R where ¯s = i or f (indexes i and f denote the initial state, i.e.

the state
before emission of photon, and the ﬁnal state, i.e. the state after emission of photon), Ks is momentum of the total

We will not use the ﬁrst term M1 (as we shall study decay in the center-of-mass system and neglect by possible
response), and the third term M3 (as we shall not study contribution of photon emission caused by the deformation
of the daughter nucleus during decay). So, we shall calculate the second matrix element. Substituting representation
for the wave function, we obtain:

(10)

Here, summation is performed over all states of nucleons. But, if operator is not dependent on relative distances
between nucleons and it does not act on spin and isospin states of nucleons, then it needs to calculate all terms of
matrix element separately. In result, we obtain:

We deﬁne the cross-section of the emitted photons on the bass of matrix element (17) in frameworks of formalism

is complex conjugation, pf i is proportional to the electrical component pel in Eqs. (10) in [25] and

Experimental data of W¨olﬂi, Hall and M¨uller [70] provides information about the emitted photons in the coplanar
geometry. So, in order to compare our approach and calculations with those data, we have to apply kinematic relations
given by Eqs. (2)–(3) in Ref. [4] (see also Eqs. (15) and (16) in [3], also [2]):

Eph = Epn1 −

4 sin2 θα + sin2 θp

4 sin2(θα) + θp o, Ef = Ei − Eph,

(24)

where Ep is incident proton energy in the laboratory frame, Eph is photon energy, Ei and Ef are relative energies in
the system-of-mass frame of the proton – α-particle system in the states before emission of photon (i.e. initial state)
and after this emission (i.e. ﬁnal state). For the energy of the system in the initial state (i.e. before the emission of
photon) in the center-of-mass frame we have Ei = mα/(mp + mα) Ep. In the experimental setup [70] the coplanar
arrangement of detectors was used. Here, protons are measured at the laboratory angle of 70◦ concerning the beam
axis (i.e. θp = 70◦), while the α-particles are measured at opposite angle of 30◦ (θα = 30◦).

For the scattering states, we use the space wave function ϕk(ρ) in the spherically symmetric approximation (i.e.
where state of the full system is dependent only on relative distance ρ = |ρ| between the scattered proton and center-of
mass-of the α-particle). We have

ϕ(ρ) = ϕ(ρ, θ, φ) =

Rl(ρ)

ρ

Ylm(θ, φ),

(25)

where Rl(ρ) and Ylm(θ, φ) are radial and angular wave functions, l and m are quantum numbers. General solution of
the wave function we ﬁnd as linear combination of two independent partial solutions c1l(ρ) and c2l(ρ) as

Rl(ρ) = Al c1l(ρ) + Bl c2l(ρ),

(26)

where Al and Bl are unknown amplitudes. In the asymptotic limit, where we have only action of Coulomb forces, we
apply

c1l(ρ) → Gl(ρ), c2l(ρ) → Fl(ρ),

(27)

where Gl(ρ) and Fl(ρ) are Coulomb wave functions. Also quantum mechanics requires to apply condition of ﬁnite value
of wave function Rl(ρ) at zero ρ = 0. These conditions and normalization of the full wave function (for the scattering
states in the continuous energy spectrum) allow us to determine the amplitudes Al and Bl. Using determination of
our wave functions above, we can ﬁnd phase shifts δl, analyzed in details in [4]. For this, we use deﬁnition (9) in [3],
and obtain:

tan δl =

Al
Bl

,

(28)

The radial wave functions c1l and c2l we calculate numerically. For description of interactions between proton and
nucleus we extrapolate potential with parameters from Ref. [82], which was intensively studied and tested in wide
region of nuclei for long time1. In order to provide a numerical basis for analysis of experimental data via computer,

1 In order to understand better a role of elastic processes in the scattering (where there is no formation of the compound 5Li nucleus),
we use only a real part of the potential [82] in calculations and obtaining results in Fig. 2. Quantum number of full momentum j, spin
projection of the scattering state are determined via the corresponding term in this potential (so, the radial wave functions Rl(ρ) are
diﬀerent for diﬀerent such numbers, see Ref. [82] for details). As a next step, possible formation of the short-lived 5Li nucleus during the
scattering can considered as inelastic process and is taken into account via inclusion of the fusion amplitudes in Eq. (30) into calculations
and in obtaining results in Fig. 3.

III. CALCULATIONS, ANALYSIS

We applied the method above to calculate the spectrum of the bremsstrahlung photons emitted during the scattering
of protons oﬀ α-particles at the incident proton energies up to 20 MeV. Previous results given in Ref. [4] for the proton
incident energies up to 25 MeV are based on the calculations of the corresponding wave functions for the scattering
states, and maxima in the bremsstrahlung spectra are explained by phase shift of these wave functions. By such a
reason, we started our calculations from analysis of the phase shifts of the wave functions for the scattering states,
which our approach provides. Results of such calculations for the ﬁrst some states are presented in Fig. 1. Comparing

FIG. 1: (Color online) Phase shifts for the scattering of protons oﬀ α-particles calculated by Eq. (28) in frameworks of our
model inside the incident proton energies till 20.0 MeV. Here, blue solid line is the calculated shift for s1/2 state, red dashed
line is the calculated shift for p3/2 state, green dash-dotted line is the calculated shift for p1/2 state, blue squared points, red
triangular points, and green circular points are empirical data for the s1/2, p3/2 and p1/2 states taken from Table III in [79].
One can see that these calculations qualitatively corresponds to data calculated by Liu, Tang and Kanada [4] with potential set
III of [83] and empirical data of Arndt, Roper, and Shotwell [79] (see Fig. 1 in [4], for details). This result can be considered as
some good indication of logical coincidence of the wave functions for the scattering states in our model and the corresponding
wave functions in the model [4]. As a nest step, one can obtain essentially higher coincidence between our phase shifts and
empirical data [79] that is subject of inverse theory (i.e., can be resolved completely, in principle) and, so, we should like to do
not consider this technical task in this paper.

2 We introduced three diﬀerent functions of errors in Eqs. (29) in order to analyze the spectra more carefully in the diﬀerent energy

regions, as they usually have exponential forms (for example, see Fig. 2(b)).

these calculation with data calculated by Liu, Tang and Kanada [4] with potential set III of [83] and empirical data
of Arndt, Roper, and Shotwell [79], we conclude that our calculated wave functions (for any states) have the same
behavior, and are in some not bad agreement (also see Fig. 1 in [4] for comparison). Supposing, that better agreement
between our calculations of the phase shifts and others results can be achieved using inverse scattering theory and is
independent more technical task, in this paper we should like to focus on the physical insight of what our approach
would give in analysis of the bremsstrahlung experimental data.

As a next step, we calculated contributions of the emitted bremsstrahlung photons from some ﬁrst transitions to
the full spectrum in frameworks of our model. Such calculations compared with experimental data of W¨olﬂi, Hall and
M¨uller [70] (we take them from Table 1 in that paper) are presented in Fig. 2. Here, one can see that the spectra are

FIG. 2: (Color online) Contributions of the emitted photons for some ﬁrst transitions to the full bremsstrahlung spectrum in
frameworks of our model inside the incident proton energies from 1.0 to 20.0 MeV, and experimental data (squared points) of
W¨olﬂi, Hall and M¨uller [70] (we normalize all calculated curves on the second point of experimental data). (a) The calculated
contributions for the transitions between states with Li = 0, 1 and Lf = 1. Here, blue solid line is for Si = +1/2 and Sf = −1/2,
red dash-dotted line is for Si = +1/2 and Sf = +1/2, brown dashed line is for Si = −1/2 and Sf = +1/2, green dash-double
dotted line is for Si = +1/2 and Sf = −1/2. One can see that hump in the experimental cross-sections can be described
if contribution formed in transition between state pi,1/2 (Li = 1 and Si = −1/2) and state pf,3/2 (Lf = 1, Sf = +1/2) is
leading. (b) The calculated contributions for the transitions between states with Li = 1 and Lf = 2. Here, blue solid line is
for Si = +1/2 and Sf = −1/2, red dash-dotted line is for Si = −1/2 and Sf = +1/2, brown dashed line is for Si = +1/2 and
Sf = +1/2, green dash-double dotted line is for Si = −1/2 and Sf = −1/2.

increased monotonously with increasing of the energy of proton for almost all studied transitions. But we observe a
visible maximum at the proton energy of Ep = 6 MeV in the spectrum for the transition between states pi,1/2 (Li = 1,
Si = −1/2) and pf,3/2 (Lf = 1, Sf = +1/2). Also there are little variations in the spectra for the transitions between
states with Li = 1 and Lf = 2 at low proton energies (which can be related with limits in accurate calculations for
the smaller cross-sections).

The full bremsstrahlung spectrum is obtained at summation of the diﬀerent contributions. Diﬀerent ratios between
contributions give diﬀerent shapes of the resulting spectrum. In particular, one can ﬁnd that hump in the experimental
cross-sections [70] can be described if contribution formed in transition pi,1/2 → pf,3/2 is leading. Moreover, changing
ratios between contributions, one can displace this hump along the proton incident energy axis. For example, in
Fig. 3(a) we demonstrate shift of such hump of the summarized spectrum, by changing ratio (deﬁned by factor f )
between contribution for transition pi,1/2 → pf,3/2 and contribution for transition si,1/2 → pf,1/2.
Now we suppose that the wave function of the scattering state of proton oﬀ the α-particle should include also
possibility to form a combined system of 5Li which lives for some short time. In formation of such a combined system
the fusion and opposite disintegration processes play important role. For example, a clear picture of importance to
study fusion in forming composed systems the α-decay provide us, which can be analyzed in three diﬀerent stages: (1)
formation of a quantum object (α- cluster having purely wave nature, behavior and quantum description) from some
nucleons inside a space region of a parent nucleus, (2) internal oscillations of this cluster before its further escaping
outside, and (3) tunneling transition of this cluster from nuclear region outside (related with tunneling through the
barrier). It is impossible to calculate correctly α-decay half-lives for any nuclei without two ﬁrst stages. But, at the

FIG. 3: (Color online) The coplanar calculated cross sections of the bremsstrahlung photons emitted during the scattering
of protons oﬀ the α particles, and experimental data (squared points) of W¨olﬂi, Hall and M¨uller [70]. (a) In this picture we
demonstrate how one can displace hump of the full spectrum along the proton incident energy axis, by changing ratio (deﬁned
by factor f ) between contribution for transition pi,1/2 → pf,3/2 and contribution for transition si,1/2 → pf,1/2. (b) Here, blue
solid line (calc. 1) is our calculated full spectrum based on all transitions given in Fig. 2(a, b) with amplitudes given in Eq. (31)
(such data are obtained on the basis of minimization of ε2, we obtain ε2 = 0.141) brown dash-double dotted line (calc. 2) is
our calculated spectrum based on transitions given in Fig. 2(a) only, green dash-dotted line is the spectrum calculated by Liu,
Tang and Kanada in [4] (see Fig. 2 in that paper), violet dashed line is the spectrum calculated by Dohet-Eraly with used
non-Siegert operator in [12] (see Fig. 3(a) in that paper). Our calculated curves for full spectrum have oscillatory behavior,
but they can be and some straighten (and agreement with experimental data can be improved) after using complex values for
the amplitudes f and inclusion of the other scattering states.

same time, calculations of the bremsstrahlung spectra in α-decay, based only on inclusion of the third stage into the
model, are very successful in description of experimental data (see [16–19, 30, 37, 39, 49], and reference therein).

Here, we note our previous progress in quantum study of fusion processes in α-capture by the 40Ca and 44Ca nuclei
[28]. As we demonstrated in that paper, quantum eﬀects in fusion play important role (i.e they can be not small),
their inclusion into the model and calculations allows to essentially improve agreement with experimental data, and
quantum description of such processes can be performed via additional amplitudes (characterizing probabilities of
presence of these processes in the diﬀerent states). Along with a logic in [28], instead of formula (22) we introduce a
new one as (here, we add numbers li, si, sf to designation of integral)

Xα=1,2

kiEr

= cE1 Xli,lf ,si,sf

fli,si,lf ,sf J (li, si, lf , sf , n = lf − 1),

(30)

where fli,si,lf ,sf are new real amplitudes characterized a possibility of formation of the compound 5Li nucleus and its
breakup (disintegration) during the transition between the initial and ﬁnal states (further in the paper, amplitudes of
the compound nucleus formation, we have 0 ≤ fli,si,lf ,sf ≤ 1). Case of fli=0,si=+1/2,lf =1,sf =±1/2 = 1 and fli,si,lf ,sf = 0
at other quantum numbers transforms formula (30) to the old Eq. (22), that corresponds to complete absence of the
formation of the compound nucleus in the scattering (i.e. the scattering takes place without any appearance of 5Li).
So, we see that such coeﬃcients characterize intensity of formation (fusion) and breakup (disintegration).

In order to clarify, if such processes are negligibly small or strong, we shall look for values of the amplitudes
fli,si,lf ,sf , at which agreement between calculations and experimental data is the best. In Fig. 3(b) we present results
of such calculations in comparison with experimental data, where the found non-zero amplitudes are3

f0,+1/2,1,−1/2 = f (s1/2 → p1/2) = 0.45263, f1,−1/2,2,−1/2 = f (p1/2 → d3/2) = 0.655.

(31)

3 All functions of errors ε1, ε2 and ε3 give practically similar minimization results in the obtaining amplitudes of compound nucleus

formation. So, for simplicity of presentation, we use ε2 for our calculations.

10

From analysis of the obtained calculations we conclude that (1) inclusion of the amplitudes of the compound nucleus
formation allows to essentially improve agreement between the full bremsstrahlung spectrum and the experimental
data, (2) transition p1/2 → p3/2 with a visible maximum at the proton energy of Ep = 6 MeV in the spectrum (see
brown dashed line in Fig. 2(a)) does not play a role in description of hump in the experimental bremsstrahlung data.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we develop microscopic formalism of our bremsstrahlung model, which was previously successfully
tested in description of experimental data in alpha-decay, proton emission from nuclei, spontaneous ﬁssion, ternary
ﬁssion, scattering of protons (at ﬁxed incident energies) oﬀ nuclei in region of the emitted photons from lowest up
to intermediate. We focus on the scattering of protons oﬀ the α-particles. In description of the scattering states we
implement our quantum formalism for calculations of wave functions based on the scattering theory. In result, we
obtain enough good agreement between the spectra calculated in frameworks of our approach and experimental data
[70] (see Fig. 3(b)). We formulate conclusions of application of this model in analysis of experimental data for this
reaction.

1. In the model connection between the bound states of nucleons inside the α-particle, the scattering states and
parameters of the emitted photon is obtained (see Eq. (18)). But, inﬂuence of the parameters of the one-nucleon
wave function on the bremsstrahlung spectrum is very small (less than 1 percent).

2. Analyzing bremsstrahlung experimental data, we observe compound nucleus 5Li formed in scattering of protons
oﬀ the α-particles. Main transitions responsible for creation of such a nucleus are s1/2 → p1/2 and p1/2 → d3/2.
3. In order to provide qualitative description of formation of the compound 5Li nucleus, we introduce the new
amplitudes characterizing probabilities of formation of this nucleus and its breakup (disintegration) at deﬁnite
transitions. Analyzing experimental data, we obtain non-zero values f (s1/2 → p1/2) = 0.45263 and f (p1/2 →
d3/2) = 0.655.

Note that only one experimental data point in [70] at the emitted photon energy at 6.9 MeV gives a decreasing
tendency of the spectrum at decreasing of energy of photons. This is not enough for a proper basis to conclude about
such a behavior of the spectrum at the smaller photon energy. If to compare the experimental data [70] with the
existed experimental data of the bremsstrahlung photons at the scattering of protons oﬀ nuclei [50–59] (see also reviews
on situation in such a research [60, 61]), α-decay [17, 18, 30–34], heavy-ion collisions [84], spontaneous ﬁssion [62–68],
neutron-induced ﬁssion [85], one can ﬁnd that experimental information from [70] is essentially not so rich. In such
regards, we see a sense in re-measuring of the bremsstrahlung emission of photons at the scattering of protons oﬀ
the α-particles inside the studied region of the emitted photon energy, and we propose for experimental people to
organize such experiments.

is composed from even number Z of protons and even number N of neutrons. For simplicity, we shall analyze a case
