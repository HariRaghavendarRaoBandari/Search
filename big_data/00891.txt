ABSTRACT
Several supernovae (SNe) with an unusually dense circumstellar medium (CSM) have been
recently observed at radio frequencies. Their radio emission is powered by relativistic elec-
trons that can be either accelerated at the SN shock (primaries) or injected as a by-product
(secondaries) of inelastic proton-proton collisions. We investigate the radio signatures from
secondary electrons, by detailing a semi-analytical model to calculate the temporal evolution
of the distributions of protons, primary and secondary electrons. With our formalism, we track
the cooling history of all the particles that have been injected into the emission region up to
a given time, and calculate the resulting radio spectra and light curves. For a SN shock prop-
agating through the progenitor wind, we ﬁnd that secondary electrons control the early radio
signatures, but their contribution decays faster than that of primary electrons. This results in
a ﬂattening of the light curve at a given radio frequency that depends only upon the radial
proﬁles of the CSM density and of the shock velocity, υ0. The relevant transition time at the
peak frequency is ∼ 190 d K−1
0,−1.5, where Aw is the wind mass-loading parameter,
β0 = υ0/c and Kep is the electron-to-proton ratio of accelerated particles. We explicitly show
that late peak times at 5 GHz (i.e., tpk (cid:38) 300 − 1000 d) suggest a shock wave propagating in
a dense wind (Aw (cid:38) 1016 − 1017 gr cm−1), where secondary electrons are likely to power the
observed peak emission.

INTRODUCTION

The recent advance in wide-ﬁeld surveys searching for optical tran-
sients (e.g. Palomar Transient Factory1, All Sky Automated Sur-
vey for Supernovae2) has revealed a whole new class of super-
novae (SNe) with atypical light curves and spectra that are of-
ten prominent in the ﬁrst hours to days following the explosion
(Kasliwal et al. 2010; Drout et al. 2013). Members of this class are
super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), which are at least ten times
brighter (i.e., with peak luminosities (cid:38) 7 × 1043 erg s−1) than typ-
ical ones (Gal-Yam 2012), but also normal-luminosity SNe with
an unusually dense circumstellar medium (CSM), such as type IIn
SNe (Kiewe et al. 2012). Several candidates for such SNe, that are
powered by the interaction with a dense CSM (hence classiﬁed as
“interaction-powered SNe”), were recently found (Gal-Yam et al.

In typical SNe the ﬁrst electromagnetic signal following the
explosion emerges, as an X-ray ﬂash, when the shock breaks out
from the stellar surface, thus probing the properties of the progeni-
tor star (e.g. Klein & Chevalier 1978; Katz et al. 2010; Nakar & Sari
2010). In interaction-powered SNe, the CSM is typically so dense
as to be optically thick to radiation. Thus, a radiation-mediated
shock propagates into the CSM and the shock breakout happens
in the dense CSM, rather than in the progenitor atmosphere (Katz
et al. 2011; Murase et al. 2011). In this case, the shock breakout
signature carries information about the mass-loss history of the pro-
genitor star prior to its explosion (e.g. Chevalier & Irwin 2011).

Radio emission in typical SNe is believed to be powered by
synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons accelerated at the
SN shock wave (see e.g. Chevalier 1982, 1998). In the case of
interaction-powered SNe, where the shock is initially radiation-
mediated (Weaver 1976), particle acceleration at the shock front

3 A couple of SLSNe were also suggested to be powered by interactions
with a dense CSM (e.g. Quimby et al. 2011; Chevalier & Irwin 2011)

is suppressed at early times. After the shock breakout, a collision-
less shock is formed (Katz et al. 2011; Murase et al. 2011), thus
allowing for particle acceleration4. Radio emission from acceler-
ated electrons is routinely used as a probe of the immediate SN
environment and of the particle acceleration eﬃciency (Chevalier
1998; Soderberg et al. 2005; Kamble et al. 2015a). Indeed, several
dozens of interaction-powered SNe have been detected at radio fre-
quencies, displaying a wide distribution in luminosities due to the
dispersion in their shock and CSM properties.

Together with electrons, protons (or ions, in general) will also
be accelerated at the shock front (e.g. Bell 1978; Blandford & Os-
triker 1978). Indeed, proton acceleration at SN remnant shocks has
been invoked to explain the production of Galactic cosmic-rays
(CRs) with energies up to ∼few PeV (see Bell 2013; Blasi 2013,
for a review). The possibility of CR acceleration beyond PeV en-
ergies in interaction-powered SNe has been recently addressed by
Katz et al. (2011); Murase et al. (2014); Cardillo et al. (2015); Zi-
rakashvili & Ptuskin (2015). The presence of CR protons in dense
environments may lead to interesting multi-messenger signatures,
such as GeV γ-ray emission and high-energy (∼ 100 TeV) neu-
trino production, as a result of inelastic pp collisions with the non-
relativistic protons of the shocked CSM. Although the smoking gun
for CR acceleration in interaction-powered SNe would be the de-
tection of high-energy neutrinos from this new class of SNe, a ﬁrm
association of the IceCube neutrinos (IceCube Collaboration 2013;
Aartsen et al. 2014a,b) with one (or more) astrophysical candidate
classes of sources is still lacking (Padovani & Resconi 2014; Kop-
per et al. 2015; Aartsen et al. 2015). Alternatively, the detection
of photon signatures that are characteristic of pp collisions would
suggest that CR acceleration is at work in these sources. As we ar-
gue below, radio synchrotron emission from secondary electrons,
which are produced in the decay chain of charged pions, can be a
valuable tool for identifying the signatures of proton acceleration.
Recently, Murase et al. (2014) have argued that secondary
electrons can emit detectable synchrotron radiation at high radio
frequencies ((cid:38) 100 GHz) or even at far-infrared wavelengths, by
deriving order-of-magnitude estimates of the peak luminosities and
frequencies. Given the importance of radio observations as an indi-
rect probe of CR acceleration in interaction-powered SNe, detailed
model predictions on the radio emission are crucial. In this pa-
per, we present detailed semi-analytical calculations of radio light
curves and spectra of synchrotron emission from primary and sec-
ondary electrons. For this, we adopt a semi-analytical formalism
and calculate the temporal evolution of the non-thermal particle dis-
tributions that are contained in a thin shell of shocked CSM. We fol-
low the evolution of three species: protons and primary electrons,
which are assumed to be accelerated at the SN forward shock, as
well as secondary relativistic electrons, which result from inelastic
pp collisions of the shock-accelerated ions with the non-relativistic
protons of the shocked CSM.

Our analysis allows for the derivation of analytical expressions
for various quantities that can serve as radio diagnostics, such as
the power-law decay slope of primary and secondary electron syn-
chrotron light curves, the peak synchrotron luminosities and the
relevant break frequencies. We show that the peak time of the light
curve, at a given radio frequency, is an important probe of the sec-
ondary electron contribution to the observed emission. In general,

4 The formation of a collisionless shock before the shock breakout and its
implications on cosmic-ray acceleration have been investigated by Giacinti
& Bell (2015).

we ﬁnd that early peak times ((cid:46) 100 d) imply a dilute stellar wind
and primary-dominated synchrotron emission. In contrast, late peak
times (i.e., (cid:38) 300−1000 d) suggest a fast (υ0 = 9×103−3×104 km
s−1) shock wave propagating in a dense medium where secondary
electrons are likely to power the peak ﬂux. We also show that the
transition from secondary-dominated to primary-dominated syn-
chrotron emission is denoted by a change in the decay slope of
the light curve. The ﬂattening in the decay slope depends only on
the radial proﬁles of the CSM and of the shock velocity. For the
speciﬁc case of a wind-like CSM, we explicitly show that the tran-
sition time depends only on the mass-loading parameter, Aw, and
on the electron-to-proton ratio, Kep as t ∝ K−1

This paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the
model under consideration. In Sect. 3 we detail the semi-analytical
formalism used to solve for the evolution of the non-thermal parti-
cle distributions with time, and continue in Sect. 4 with the presen-
tation of an indicative example. We focus on the radio synchrotron
emission in Sect. 5, where we derive analytical expressions for var-
ious quantities that may serve as radio diagnostics. We present nu-
merical results of synchrotron spectra and light curves, while dis-
cussing the eﬀect of various model parameters in Sect. 6. In Sect. 7
we demonstrate the relevance of our results to SN radio observa-
tions and discuss our results and the model predictions in Sect. 8.
We conclude in Sect. 9 with a summary of our results. The reader
interested primarily in the astrophysical implications of our ﬁnd-
ings might want to skip the technical paragraphs (Sections 3 and 4)
and move directly to Sect. 5.

Throughout this work we use the notation Gx = G/10x in cgs
units, except for the mass loss rate that is measured in M(cid:12) /yr and
the masses of the SN ejecta and CSM that are normalized to M(cid:12).
For the required transformations between the reference systems of
the SNe and the observer, we have adopted a cosmology with Ωm =
0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7 and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1.

2 MODEL DESCRIPTION

The interaction of the freely-expanding SN ejecta with the CSM
gives rise to two shock waves, i.e. a fast shock wave in the circum-
stellar material (forward shock) and a reverse shock in the outer
parts of the SN ejecta. The CSM is modelled as an extended shell
with inner and outer radii rcsm and rw, respectively. This is illus-
trated in Fig. 1. As long as the interaction between the SN ejecta
and the CSM takes place within a region that is optically thick
to Thomson scattering (τT (cid:29) 1), the SN shock will be radiation-
mediated and particle acceleration will be suppressed (e.g. Murase
et al. 2011; Katz et al. 2011). The shock wave is expected to break
out at a radius rbo where τT ∼ c/υs and υs is the forward shock
velocity (Weaver 1976). For dense CSM environments the shock
is expected to break out in the wind (rbo > rcsm), whereas for di-
lute wind environments the shock breakout occurs in the stellar
envelope. The second physical scenario is, however, not interest-
ing for the present study, since for a dilute CSM the signature of
secondary particles produced through pp collisions will be quite
weak. At r > rbo the previously radiation-mediated shock becomes
collisionless and particle acceleration can, in principle, take place.
Thus, rbo can be considered as an eﬀective inner edge of the CSM,
or rin ≡ rbo. Henceforth, this will be used as our normalization ra-
dius. The mass density proﬁle of the CSM is written as (e.g. Cheva-
lier 1982)

where β0 ≡ υ0/c was assumed. As the breakout time of the SN
shock and its respective velocity are the parameters to be ﬁrst deter-
mined by SNe observations, we will treat as primary model param-
eters rin and υ0 rather than ρ0 (or, Aw in the case of a wind density
proﬁle). For compact stars with tenuous fast winds the shock break-
out may happen close to the progenitor radius, i.e. rin ∼ a few times
1011 cm (see Waxman et al. 2007). For progenitors with high mass-
loss rates, however, the shock breakout is expected to take place in
the wind and well outside the progenitor, i.e. rin ∼ 1013 − 1014 cm
(see Rabinak & Waxman 2011; Chevalier 2012).

The ejecta-CSM interaction leads eventually to the formation
of a shell with high internal energy density (e.g. Chevalier 1982;
Chevalier & Fransson 1994; Truelove & McKee 1999), whose
equation of motion was studied by Chevalier (1982) for the case of
spherically expanding SN ejecta with a power-law density proﬁle,
i.e. ρSN ∝ r−nsn. The density proﬁles of both the SN ejecta and the
CSM are necessary for detailed calculations, since the time evolu-
tion of the shock front radius and velocity υs depends on these. For
the purposes of our study it is suﬃcient to assume that the shock
velocity has a radial power-law proﬁle of the form

υs(r) = υ0

,

(6)

The power-law index α (cid:54) 0 can be written in terms of the power-
law indices of the CSM and SN ejecta density proﬁles (e.g. Ofek
et al. 2014b). Typically, the forward shock is expected to be mildly
decelerating, unless the SN ejecta have a ﬂat density proﬁle (nsn <
3) (e.g. Chevalier 1982; Tan et al. 2001). For example, α = −0.1
for a wind-like CSM (w = 2) and ejecta with nsn = 12, whereas if
both media are uniform the SN shock propagates with a constant
velocity, at least in the free expansion phase (e.g. Matzner & Mc-
Kee 1999). To keep our analysis as general as possible, we will
treat the index α as a free parameter. Table 1 summarizes the free
parameters of the model.

The free expansion phase of the SN ejecta lasts until the mass
in the ejecta Mej is comparable to the swept-up mass Msw. The tran-
sition from the free expansion phase to the so-called Sedov-Taylor

where ˙Mw and υw are, respectively, the mass loss rate and veloc-

10−3 M(cid:12) /yr with the high and low values corresponding respec-
tively to Wolf-Rayet (Crowther 2007) and red supergiant progen-
itors. The range in the velocities is accordingly wide, namely
υw ≈ 10 − 103 km s−1 (e.g. Chevalier & Li 2000), with slower
winds being generally related to progenitors with higher mass loss
rates. Since the production rate of secondary particles through pp
collisions is proportional to the CSM number density, it is conve-
nient to use ρ0 — or Aw in the case of a wind density proﬁle — as
our main model parameter.

where we used eq. (2) and eq. (5). In the above, Mej,1 ≡ Mej/10M(cid:12).
For typical parameters, we thus ﬁnd rdec (cid:39) 0.3 − 3 pc; these dis-
tances are much larger than the characteristic shock radii that we
will consider in this work.

In the present work we will focus on the acceleration and non-
thermal emission from the forward shock. As long as the density
proﬁle of the ejecta is steep, the contribution of the reverse shock to
the observed non-thermal radiation is expected to be small (Cheva-
lier & Fransson 2003; see also Fig. 3 in Zirakashvili & Ptuskin
2015). We further assume that all the material accreted by the for-
ward shock is conﬁned in a thin homogeneous layer downstream
of the forward shock (e.g. Chevalier 1982; Sturner et al. 1997). At
the early stages of the SN expansion, the forward shock is expected
to have Mach numbers (cid:29) 1. We therefore assume that the com-
pression ratio is ≈ 4 (e.g. Sturner et al. 1997) and the width of the
shock is then 25% of the shock radius. The latter is in rough agree-
ment with the ﬁndings of recent hydrodynamic calculations of the
shock structure (Zirakashvili & Ptuskin 2015). Similarly, Cheva-
lier (1982) found that for steep density proﬁles of the SN ejecta
(nsn = 7−12) the width of the shocked CSM at radius r is h ∼ 0.2 r.
Under these considerations, the average density of the shocked
CSM is a factor of four larger than the upstream CSM density at
that radius, i.e. n(r) = 4 ncsm(r) or

Strictly speaking, the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions across a
strong shock determine the particle density right behind the shock
as a function of the upstream properties. Here, we assume the same
scaling for the volume-averaged post-shock density.

For the calculation of the synchrotron emission, an estimate
of the post-shock magnetic ﬁeld strength is required. We assume
that the magnetic energy density in the shell of shocked CSM is a
ﬁxed fraction B of the post-shock thermal energy density5, which
is written as Uth(r) = (9/32)mpυ2
s (r)n(r). Here, we considered that
the upstream speed in the post-shock frame is 3 υs/4, so the mean
post-shock energy per particle is (9/16)mpυ2

2.1 The injection of primary particles

In this section we determine the injection distributions of primary
electrons and protons, focusing only on relativistic particles. We
assume that a fraction of the incoming particles at the SN shock
will be accelerated into a power-law distribution in energy7, with
the nature of the acceleration process itself not being crucial for
the present study. CR that have accelerated at the shock front will
subsequently escape in the donwstream region of the shock where
they will lose energy via various physical processes (see below). It
is in this region where the production of secondary particles due to
pp collisions takes place (see e.g. Mastichiadis 1996; Sturner et al.
1997).

(14)

−sH[γ − γi,m]H[γi,M − γ]

If s is the power-law index of the distribution, the injection
function for both primary electrons and protons, i.e. the number of
relativistic particles injected in the shell per unit Lorentz factor and
per unit radius, Qi(γ, r) ≡ d2Ni/dγdr, can be written as
Qi(γ, r) = Q0i gi(r) γ
where i = e, p, H[x] = 1 for x > 0 and 0 otherwise, gi is an arbitrary
function of radius, and γi,m, γi,M are the minimum and maximum
Lorentz factors of particles at injection (to be speciﬁed below). The
exact value of the power-law index depends on the details of shock
acceleration, such as non-linear eﬀects at the shock front and shock
obliquity (e.g. Jones & Ellison 1991, and references therein), which
are not treated in this study. Thus, we will consider s to be a free pa-
rameter of the model and assume that is the same for electrons and
protons. We remark that the formalism we present below does not
hold only for a power-law injection function, but it can be applied
to injection distributions with an arbitrary dependence on energy.

2.1.1 The injection rate and minimum energy at injection

The normalization factor Q0i can be determined based on recent
kinetic simulations, that can capture the acceleration of protons
at non-relativistic shocks from ﬁrst principles (e.g. Caprioli &
Spitkovsky 2014a; Park et al. 2015). It has been found that, if the
shock is quasi-parallel, i.e., the magnetic ﬁeld in the upstream is

6 This implies that synchrotron emission at the observing frequency is not
free-free absorbed, i.e. νﬀ (cid:46) νobs. For more details, see Sec. 5.1
7 If particle acceleration is governed by the ﬁrst order Fermi process (e.g.
Axford et al. 1977; Bell 1978; Webb et al. 1984), then strictly speaking,
the accelerated particle distribution will be a power-law in in momentum,
not energy. However, by focusing on relativistic particles with γ (cid:38) 2, we
can use interchangeably the terms particle energy and momentum (see also
Appendix A).

nearly aligned (within (cid:46) 45◦) with the direction of shock prop-
agation, a fraction p ∼ 5 − 10% of the shock energy is chan-
neled into relativistic protons (γ (cid:38) 2). In the following, we as-
sume p to be constant in time and treat it as a free parameter (see
also Appendix A). The incoming kinetic energy per unit radius is
Ek = (9π/32)mpυ2
s (r) r2n(r), where we used the same considera-
tions as for the derivation of Uth. From the requirement that rela-
tivistic protons acquire a fraction p of the incoming energy per unit
radius, we can determine the normalization Q0p as

The above relations are derived using eqs. (6) and (9) under the
assumptions of γp,M (cid:29) γp,m and γp,m = 2 (see also Appendix A). In
the case of a wind-like CSM (w = 2) and constant shock velocity
(α = 0) the injection rate is constant, i.e. gp = 1.

Unlike protons, shock-accelerated electrons are all likely to
be ultra-relativistic, which is indeed consistent with modeling
the radio emission signature of interaction-powered supernovae:
SN 2009ip (Margutti et al. 2014), SN 2010jl (Fransson et al. 2014;
Ofek et al. 2014b), SN 1988Z (Chugai & Danziger 1994), and
2006jd (Chandra et al. 2012). Assuming energy equipartition be-
tween thermal post-shock electrons and protons, we ﬁnd that the
Lorentz factor of thermal electrons is

where here the shock velocity was normalized to 0.1c. Because
of the quadratic dependence on the shock velocity, the thermal
electrons turn out to be non-relativistic at slower shocks. Recent
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations (e.g. Park et al. 2015; Guo et al.
2014a,b) show that the minimum momentum of the electron distri-
bution is three times larger than the thermal one. For our calcula-
tions, we will therefore adopt γe,m = 3γe,th, if the latter is mildly
relativistic (see eq. (17)). Otherwise, we will assume that γe,m = 1
(see also Appendix A).

For the electron normalization, we adopt the common assump-
tion that the ratio of the electron to proton spectrum at a given en-
ergy E (cid:29) mpc2 is Kep, namely

with Kep ranging typically between 10−3−5×10−3 according to PIC
simulations (e.g. Park et al. 2015). These values are in rough agree-
ment with those inferred from observations. A value of Kep (cid:39) 0.01
is determined by direct measurements of cosmic-rays at Earth at
10 GeV (e.g. Cohen & Ramaty 1973; Picozza et al. 2013). Ob-
servations of young SN remnants at X-ray and GeV γ-rays imply
Kep (cid:46) 10−3 (e.g. V¨olk et al. 2005; Morlino & Caprioli 2012; Yuan

been reported (e.g. Gaisser et al. 1998). In the following, we adopt
Kep = 10−3 as the default value (see Table 1). The above expression

while the radial dependence of the electron injection function is the
same as for the protons, namely ge(r) = gp(r).

2.1.2 The maximum energy at injection

The maximum energy of particles being accelerated at the shock is
determined by the competition of acceleration and various cooling
as well as loss processes (e.g. Gaisser 1990; Mastichiadis 1996;
Sturner et al. 1997). In this paragraph, we estimate the maximum
Lorentz factor of accelerated electrons and protons by comparing
the relevant acceleration timescales with the dynamical and cooling
timescales.

• Acceleration timescale: the scattering at the basis of the Fermi
acceleration process is usually assumed to proceed in the Bohm
limit, leading to tacc,i ∼ 6γmic3/eBυ2
s (e.g. Protheroe & Clay 2004;
Rieger et al. 2007; Tammi & Duﬀy 2009).
the acceleration
timescale is shorter than the dynamical timescale tdyn(r) ∼ r/υs
(which is the typical timescale of adiabatic losses) we derive

timescale: by requiring that

(20)

which is independent of the shock radius for aB = 1 and α = 0. As
tdyn is also a measure of the age of the system, we will refer to this
criterion as the “age criterion”. For the wind CSM density proﬁle
and typical parameter values, we ﬁnd that the age constraint limits
the maximum particle Lorentz factor to

where we used eq. (12), while Aw is related to β0, rin through eq. (5).
Protons in the shocks of type IIn SNe can, in principle, achieve
multi-PeV energies due to the high-density CSM, as it has been
already noted by Katz et al. (2011); Murase et al. (2011, 2014);
Zirakashvili & Ptuskin (2015).

B,−2 β2

(21)

The age criterion is closely related to the so-called conﬁnement
criterion, which requires the particle gyro-radius to be smaller than
the maximum wavelength λmax of the scattering turbulence, to avoid
the particle escape from the acceleration region. If λmax ∼ r, the re-
spective maximum Lorentz factor is larger by a factor of c/υs than
that derived from the age criterion. In this regard, the age criterion
is more constraining. However, if λmax (cid:28) r, then the maximum pro-
ton energy may be limited to energies much below the PeV energy
range, as it has been recently demonstrated by Metzger et al. (2016)
for the case of gamma-ray novae. The cosmic-ray conﬁnement is
non-trivial, since it depends on the details of the acceleration pro-
cess, the magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation and the ionization properties
of the upstream medium8. The exact value of the maximum parti-
cle energy is not crucial for the purposes of the present study. Thus,
eq. (21) will be used in the following.
• Cooling timescales: the most relevant cooling processes for
relativistic electrons are synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)
scattering energy losses. The corresponding losses for relativistic
protons are negligible. Inelastic pp collisions and photohadronic
interactions (photopion and photopair production) are the most rel-
evant processes for determining the maximum energy of relativistic
protons (e.g. Katz et al. 2011; Murase et al. 2011). Coulomb and

8 The details of the microphysical processes could be incorporated in a
dimensionless parameter ξλ (cid:54) 1 by parameterizing λmax = ξλr. Then, the
maximum particle Lorentz factor would given by eq. (21) multiplied by the
term min[1, ξλc/υs].

bremsstrahlung energy losses become important only at low ener-
gies and do not play role in setting the maximum particle energy.

(i) Synchrotron cooling: by setting tacc,e = tsyn, where tsyn(γ, r) =

Lorentz factor. For the general case, this is given by

(ii) Inverse Compton cooling: relativistic electrons also lose en-

take into account a possible decay of the SN luminosity with time
(or radius) we model the SN luminosity as LSN = LSN,pk(rin/r)aph

such as the cosmic microwave background and the galactic op-
tical/infrared photon ﬁelds, are not included in the present anal-
ysis, since their energy density is typically lower than that given
in eq. (24). For example, if LSN =const∼ 1041 erg s−1, the en-
ergy density of SN photons is higher than that of ambient photon
ﬁelds as long as r (cid:46) 0.3 kpc (see also Gaisser et al. 1998). As-

The above hold as long as the IC scatterings take place in the

scattering rate becomes important for γ (cid:38) mec2/ph, or γ (cid:38) 5 ×
105 for ph = 1 eV, which is the typical photon energy for the
SN emission. Although the Klein-Nishina suppression may be
not relevant for primary electrons, the IC scatterings of optical
photons by secondary electrons will take place deep in the Klein-
Nishina regime (see Sect. 3 for more details).

At each shock radius, the highest energy electrons will be in-

eral, synchrotron (and IC) cooling will dominate at early times,
whereas the age criterion becomes relevant at larger shock radii,
where both the magnetic and photon ﬁeld energy densities have
considerably decreased.

of pp collisions on the accelerated protons. The corresponding
timescale is

9 For simplicity, we consider the SN itself as the main source of soft pho-
tons. In principle, the hot shell of shocked CSM can also be an eﬃcient
radiation, via free-free emission. See Appendix D for details.

where we assumed a constant inelasticity κpp (cid:39) 0.5 and ne-
glected the weak energy-dependence of the cross section σpp (cid:39)
3 × 10−26 cm2; however, the energy-dependent cross section is
taken into account in our numerical calculations (for more de-
tails, see Sect. 3).
In eq. (27) it is the density of the shocked
CSM that appears, since pp collisions are assumed to take place
in the post-shock region. By requiring that tacc,p = tpp, we ﬁnd
that the maximum proton Lorentz factor is limited to

which increases linearly in radius for a shock propagating with a
constant velocity in a wind-like CSM, namely
p,M (cid:39) 2.7 × 105 β3
γ(2)
Inspection of eqs. (21) and (29) shows that pp losses dominate
over adiabatic proton cooling at small radii, but since the former
increases with radius, the maximum energy of protons at later
times is set by the age criterion.
(iv) Photohadronic energy losses: in the presence of photon
ﬁelds, energetic protons may lose energy through photohadronic
interactions. Although the energy threshold for photopion pro-
duction on ph = 1 eV photons is high (γp,pπ (cid:38) mπc2/ph (cid:39)
1.5 × 108/(ph/1 eV)) and thus not relevant for our study, pro-
tons with Lorentz factors γp,BH (cid:38) mec2/ph = 5 × 105/(ph/1 eV)
may lose energy through Bethe-Heitler pair production. It can
be shown that the respective timescale, which can be recast in
a similar form as tpp (see Appendix B), is the longest one for
a wide range of parameter values and can be safely neglected.
Same as for the electrons, the maximum proton Lorentz factor at
injection will be γp,M = min[γ(1)

p,M, γ(2)

p,M].

2.2 The injection of secondary electrons

e

Secondary electrons are the by-product of charged pion decays, i.e.
π± → µ± + νµ(¯νµ) and µ± → e± + ¯νµ(νµ) + νe(¯νe). Their injection
rate (Q(pp)
) depends on the number density of “thermal” (i.e., non-
relativistic) protons that are the targets for pp collisions, or equiv-
alently on n(r), and on the distribution of accelerated protons, that
evolves as the shock propagates in the CSM. Thus, the evolution of
the proton distribution is necessary for the calculation of the injec-
tion rate Q(pp)
. Aim of this paragraph is to derive a rough estimate
of the ratio Q(pp)
e /Qe and investigate its dependence on the model
parameters, such as Aw. An accurate treatment of the secondary in-
jection distributions will be presented in Sect. 7, where we employ
the expressions by Kelner et al. (2006).

e

2.2.1 The injection rate

As an indicative example we assume a power-law proton distribu-
tion of the form Np(γ, r) = Q0p r γ−s H[γp,M − γ]H[γ − γp,m], where
the radial dependence is relevant to the case of a wind-type CSM
and a constant shock velocity (for the general case of w (cid:44) 2 and
α (cid:44) 0, see Appendix C). We furthermore use approximate expres-
sions for the pion production rate, as presented in Mannheim &
Schlickeiser (1994). The following calculations are based on sev-
eral assumptions that we list for clarity:

• we ignore the (weak) energy dependence of the pp cross sec-

tion, i.e. σpp (cid:39) 3 × 10−26 cm2.

dependent of the proton energy in the laboratory frame.

• the multiplicity of pion production is taken to be ξ ∼ 1/3 in-
• for a single proton, the rate of increase of pion energy is ap-
proximated by a δ-function centered at the average pion energy

the SN shock is expected to be most important at small radii. Inter-
estingly, if the shock propagates in a thick CSM shell with uniform
(high) density (w = 0), then the ratio of secondary to primary elec-
trons will increase as the shock propagates, provided that it is not

Interestingly, at r = rin the ratio depends only on Kep and the

production of secondaries, since the ratio Q(pp)
e /Qe increases. This
result may seem counterintuitive at ﬁrst sight but, in retrospect,
it is not surprising. The ratio of injection between secondary and
primary electrons will be proportional to (Qp/Qe) × (tage/tpp) ∝
0 r−1, where tage ∼ r/β0c is the age of the system. Slower

2.3 The parameter space Aw − r
In the case of wind CSM density proﬁle, a parameter space of the
mass loading parameter Aw versus the shock radius r can be con-
structed using the following considerations:

(i) Particle acceleration at radiation mediated shocks is sup-
pressed (e.g. Waxman & Loeb 2001; Katz et al. 2011). Roughly
speaking, the shock is not radiation mediated if τT (cid:46) c/υs or

(ii) As the magnetic ﬁeld in the shocked shell depends on the
CSM density, it is expected that for high enough Aw values the
magnetic energy density UB in the shell will exceed that of the SN
radiation ﬁeld Uph. A lower limit on Aw can be derived by requiring
UB (cid:62) Uph, namely

secondary radiative signatures.
The parameter space Aw − r calculated for α = 0 and aph = 0 is

regime where a collisionless shock may be formed, thus allowing
particle acceleration, and at the same time UB (cid:62) Uph. The red col-
ored region shows the parameter space where 1 (cid:54) Q(pp)

For a given shock velocity at the breakout radius (rin), the value of
the respective Aw can be read from the blue dashed line. Each hor-
izontal line starting from a point (Aw, rin) and extending to rdec (or-
ange line) denotes the evolutionary path of the system that we will
consider. Interestingly, the two diﬀerent evolutionary paths shown

on the right hand side and/or of a particle sink term on the left hand
side, eq. (44) simply describes the conservation of the particle num-
ber. Spatial diﬀusion and advection are not considered here, since
the shell is assumed to be homogeneous and all the material to be
contained in the shell. Diﬀusion in momentum space due to moving
Alfv´en waves turns to be negligible and is, therefore, neglected.

It is more convenient to solve the equation above with respect
to the shock radius r instead of time t. Since dr/dt = υs(r), where
υs is the shock velocity, the particle kinetic equation can be recast
in the form
∂Ni
(45)
∂r
where γ(cid:48) ≡ dγ/dr, Qi(γ, r) ≡ ˜Qi(γ, t)/υs(r) and Ni ≡ Ni(γ, r). In
the case where the particle-containing volume undergoes adiabatic
expansion, it is the total number of particles Ni that should enter
the equation above instead of the volume-averaged number density
ni ≡ d2N/dVdγ. In fact, the volume-averaged number density ni
would not be conserved due to the volume expansion of the shell.
The kinetic equation written in terms of diﬀerential particle den-
sities would then read (to be contrasted with the commonly-used
eq. (9) in Sturner et al. (1997))

where the volume of the shocked shell is V ≈ 4πr2h and h is the
width of shell, which is assumed to be a fraction of the shock ra-
dius. Inelastic pp collisions can be approximated as catastrophic
energy losses, since the proton in one collision loses a signiﬁcant
fraction (κpp) of its energy (e.g. Sturner et al. 1997). In this approxi-
mation, the pp collisions are treated as an escape term in the kinetic
equation of protons (eq. (45)), which is of the form −Np/tpp (e.g.
Schlickeiser 2002). In this case, pp losses do not aﬀect the evolu-
tion of the high-energy cutoﬀ of the distribution (e.g. Mastichiadis
& Kirk 1995), but just the number of available protons. The energy
loss terms due to photohadronic interactions are less important than
the aforementioned cooling processes and can be safely neglected.
For suﬃciently high density in the shocked shell, trans-relativistic
protons may also cool due to Coulomb collisions with background
thermal electrons. However, at these low energies the exact shape of
the proton distribution is not crucial, since their non-thermal emis-
sion is irrelevant to radio observations and the cross section for pp
collisions decreases signiﬁcantly. The evolution of the proton dis-

tion rates. As long as the shock breakout occurs in the CSM with
a wind-like density proﬁle, the ratio Q(pp)
e /Qe at r = rin is indepen-
dent of Aw and rin (see also eq. (40)). The free model parameters
and their values for the default case, that represents a SN shock
propagating with a constant velocity in a wind-like CSM, are sum-
marized in Table 1.

3 A SEMI-ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE

PARTICLE EVOLUTION

In this section, we detail our semi-analytical formalism to solve for
the evolution of the electron and proton spectrum (see also Finke &
Dermer 2012). This will be later applied to the early phases of SNe
that expand in a CSM with non-uniform density proﬁle. We stress,
however, that the formalism we present here can be applied to a
generic phase of supernova evolution and to an arbitrary power-law
proﬁle of the external medium.

(cid:16)

We will be solving the evolutionary equations for protons and
electrons (both primary and secondary) in the presence of losses
and of a given injection term, which is provided by the particle
escape downstream of the shock (e.g. Mastichiadis 1996; Kirk et al.
1998). The general equation to be solved is
∂ ˜Ni
(44)
∂t
where i = e, p, ˙γ ≡ dγ/dt is the energy loss term and ˜Ni(γ, t) is the
total number of particles in the shell at a given time t with Lorentz
factors between γ and γ + dγ. In the absence of the injection term

the Thomson and Klein-Nishina regime can be found (e.g. Mod-
erski et al. 2005), these do not allow for analytical solution of the
electron kinetic equation. However, if the IC cooling is not impor-
tant compared to other loss processes, then the complications of
the Klein-Nishina eﬀects can be ignored. Indeed, for dense CSM,
where the emission signatures of secondary electrons will be im-
portant, synchrotron cooling is expected to dominate over IC cool-
ing (see also Fig. 2). Thus, we may conﬁdently use eq. (55), as long
as the electrons cool predominantly due to synchrotron radiation
(see condition eq. (42) and Fig. 2).

where γ0 in the integral is considered a function of r0, r and γ (see

radius as well as on the cooling history of particles (for details, see
Appendix C).

3.2 The electron distribution

Besides cooling due to adiabatic expansion (see eq. (47)), relativis-
tic electrons lose energy due to synchrotron radiation and IC scat-
tering. Using eqs. (11) and (6) the synchrotron cooling term is writ-
ten as

0rin/(6πmecυ0) is a dimensionless constant and
qsyn = 2aB + α. For the calculation of the IC cooling term, we as-
sume that the dominant photon ﬁeld that is present in the shocked
shell is the SN optical radiation. The IC scatterings between elec-
trons and photons with characteristic energy ph = 1 eV take place
in the Thomson regime, as long as γ (cid:46) γKN ≡ mec2/ph ∼ 5 × 105.
For electrons with γ < γKN the IC cooling term reads, in complete
analogy with eq. (54), as

where Kic = 4σT U0rin/(3mecυ0) and qic = 2 +aph + α. For γ (cid:29) γKN
the cooling rate is reduced due to the Klein-Nishina suppression of
the cross section (e.g. Blumenthal & Gould 1970). Although ap-
proximate expressions of the cooling rate that interpolate between

In the absence of a continuous source of particles and/or a sink
term of particles, eq. (45) for the evolution of the electron spectrum
is a conservation equation for the number of electrons. It follows
that the electron spectrum Ne(γ, r) at radius r can be simply re-
lated to the electron spectrum at an arbitrary radius r0, namely with
Ne(γ0, r0), via

Sect. 2 an approximate expression for Q(pp)
has been used, since it
was suﬃcient for a rough estimate. In what follows, a more accurate
expression for the production rate of secondary electrons is adopted
(Kelner et al. 2006, henceforth, KAB06). Using the KAB06 for-
malism and our notation, the injection rate of secondaries can be
written as

where M = mp/me, y = Ep/mpc2, x = Ee/Ep = γ/My, Ee, Ep
are the electron and proton energies, and Fe(x, Ep) is deﬁned by
eqs. (62)-(65) in KAB06. We note that n and υs have, in principle, a
radial dependence. The expression above is valid for Ep (cid:62) 0.1 TeV
and x > 10−3 (or, γ (cid:38) 200). An accurate continuation of the cal-
culations to proton energies close to the threshold energy for pp
collisions has been presented by Dermer (1986). For the purposes
of our study, it is suﬃcient to adopt the δ-function approximation
for the pion production rate for lower proton energies (see discus-
sion in KAB06). In this case, the secondary electron injection rate
can be calculated by

where eqs. (36)-(39) and (77) of KAB06 were used. In the above
equation, Emin = Ee + mπc2/4Ee, x = Ee/Eπ, Eπ is the charged
pion energy, y = 1 + Eπ/(mpc2˜κpp), ˜κpp = 0.17 is the proton in-
elasticity used in KAB06, ˜fe is a function deﬁned by eqs. (36)-(39)
in KAB06, and ˜n is the pion production multiplicity. This depends
on the power-law index of the proton distribution as well as on
the species of secondary particles. KAB06 provide the values for
s = 2, 2.5 and 3. These are respectively ˜n = 0.77, 0.62 and 0.67.
Since protons suﬀer only from adiabatic losses, the power-law in-
dex of the distribution will be the same as at injection. Thus, by
choosing s to be 2, 2.5 or 3 at injection, we can adopt the values
for ˜n for the calculation of the secondary injection rate. As the δ-
function approximation is not accurate for high proton energies,
namely Ep (cid:29) 0.1 TeV, in our calculations we combine both ap-
proaches. For Ep (cid:46) 100 TeV, we use the rate given by eq. (65)
while the rate of eq. (64) is used, otherwise.

In brief, we have presented a semi-analytical model for calcu-
lating the time evolution of primary and secondary particle distri-
butions. The adopted formalism

• takes into account the cooling history of all particles that have
• provides the shape of the spectrum at all energies. More pre-
cisely, even if at radius r particles are injected with γ (cid:62) γi,m(r), the
computed spectrum extends below γi,m(r), as a result of the cooling
of particles injected at earlier times. This is particularly important
for secondary electrons, since the minimum injected momentum in
e,min (cid:39) 76. Furthermore, the
that case is ultra-relativistic, namely γ(pp)
cooling break in the particle distributions is a natural outcome of
the self-consistent treatment of particle evolution; there is no need
to introduce the breaks by hand.
• allows us to calculate self-consistently the evolution of the
low-and high-energy cutoﬀs of the particle distributions. These can
be used, for example, to calculate the time evolution of the mini-
mum/maximum characteristic synchrotron frequencies, as well as
the synchrotron self-absorption frequency (see Sect. 7).
• can be equally employed to source terms with a diﬀerent en-
ergy dependence than the usual power-law ∝ γ−s; this lies upon
the fact that the calculation of Ni(γ, r) is simpliﬁed into a one-

dimensional integral (see eqs. (48) and (63)). This last point jus-
tiﬁes our choice of the term semi-analytical model.

It has been already noted by Murase et al. (2014) that a combina-
˙Mw and υw leading to high values of the mass load param-
tion of
eter Aw is necessary for the secondary synchrotron emission to be
observable at high (> 100 GHz) radio frequencies. Since the mag-
netic ﬁeld strength scales as n1/2, electron synchrotron cooling11
becomes important for high values of Aw, unless B (cid:28) 10−4. Us-
ing the formalism presented in Sect. 2 and Sect. 3 we can derive the
evolution of primary and secondary electron distributions for s = 2.
In particular, if the particles radiating at radio frequencies be-
long to the cooled part of the distribution, i.e. γ (cid:29) γc, where the
cooling break γc is given by

where the subscript ≷ γc should be interpreted as γ ≷ γc. It is
noteworthy that, for a constant shock velocity, the number of accel-
erated electrons that have undergone synchrotron cooling increases
as r2, whereas the number of secondary electrons increases at a
∝ r. However, if the shock encountered a
slower rate, i.e. N(pp)
thick CSM shell with a ﬂatter12 density proﬁle, e.g. w = 1/2, then
a faster increase of the number of secondary electrons is expected.
For completeness, the results for the uncooled (γ (cid:28) γc) primary
and secondary electron distributions are listed below:

As synchrotron cooling is not important in this regime, we ﬁnd,
as expected, no explicit dependence of the electron number on the
magnetic ﬁeld strength. In fact, the uncooled electron part of the
distribution traces directly the injection rate. For the default case,
we ﬁnd Ne ∝ r and N(pp)
∝ const, which should be respectively
compared to eqs. (67) and (68). In the general case of s (cid:44) 2, the
radial dependence of the total number of cooled and uncooled elec-
trons can also be derived using basic scaling arguments, as we now
detail. The number of primary electrons not aﬀected by synchrotron
cooling is Ne ∝ pKepυ2
s r3−w, where the factor r3−w is related to the
total accreted mass. As υs ∝ rα it follows that, quite generally, the

11 Synchrotron cooling does not aﬀect the proton spectrum, even for high
values of Aw, where the pp losses become dominant.
12 The expressions above have been derived for qsyn = w−α (cid:44) 0 and cannot
be directly applied to the case of a uniform medium, unless α (cid:44) 0. This
requires modiﬁcation of eq. (59) and a similar analysis as the one presented
in Appendix C.

slope in electron spectrum steepens from −2 to −3. On the con-
trary, the proton distribution at all radii has the same shape as at
injection, since it is aﬀected only by adiabatic losses. The proton
maximum Lorentz factor at injection increases at early times ac-
cording to eq. (28) (see the ﬁrst three black curves from the bot-
tom) and saturates at the value deﬁned by eq. (20). The spacing
between the curves shown in Fig. 3 reﬂects the radial (or, equiva-
lently time) evolution of the diﬀerent particle species. In particu-
lar, we ﬁnd that Ne at a given Lorentz factor increases faster than
N(pp)
, since the latter depends also on the CSM density proﬁle that
e
decreases with radius. In addition, the radial dependence of Ni as
obtained numerically agrees quantitatively with the analytical pre-
dictions (see eqs. (67)-(70)).

Figure 4 shows with solid lines the evolution of the proton

energy densities, for the same parameters as in Fig. 313. The ratios
of the particle (magnetic) to thermal energy densities are overplot-
ted with dashed lines. The ratio UB/Uth, where UB = B2/8π, is con-
stant and equal to B, as expected. Similarly, we ﬁnd that Up/Uth →

the result of the increasing proton maximum energy at small radii.
The ratio Ue/Uth — where Ue is the primary electron energy
density, deﬁned in a similar way as Up — increases, albeit with
a slow rate. For all the considered radii, we ﬁnd Ue/Uth (cid:28) 1.
This ratio is similar to the parameter e that is commonly used
in the literature. However, it diﬀers in essence, since Ue in our
approach takes into account the cooling history of all electrons
that have been injected at smaller radii. In the absence of cooling,

4.1 An indicative example of particle evolution

An indicative example for the evolution of the particle distributions
as obtained for the default case (see Table 1) is presented in Fig. 3.
For clarity reasons, the primary and secondary electron distribu-
tions are displayed in the left and right panels with red dashed
lines, respectively. For the adopted parameters, synchrotron radi-
ation is the dominant cooling process for electrons (primary and
secondary) for a wide range of shock radii, i.e. r ≈ 1014 − 1017 cm,
which corresponds to t ≈ 1.3 − 1300 days for υ0 = 9 × 103 km s−1.
Here, the deceleration radius is rdec (cid:39) 1 pc.
At early times, the distribution of electrons is cooled due to
synchrotron losses down to γ ∼ γe,m with the cooling break (see
eq. (66)) progressively moving to larger values as the magnetic ﬁeld
decreases; the cooling break is identiﬁed by the location where the

decreases faster compared to all other energy densities and its ratio
to Uth is the lowest one at large radii.

5 SYNCHROTRON EMISSION

Having derived the evolution of the particle distributions as the for-
ward shock propagates in the CSM, the synchrotron emission from
both primary and secondary electrons, as well as from relativistic
protons can be derived. Synchrotron emission at radio frequencies
may be suppressed because of absorption processes, such as syn-
chrotron self-absorption and free-free absorption. Moreover, in the
presence of a background plasma, the synchrotron emission of a
relativistic particle with Lorentz factor γ will be suppressed at low
enough frequencies, since the beaming of the radiation is not as
strong at frequencies (cid:28) γωp , where ωp is the plasma frequency;
this is known as the Razin eﬀect (Razin 1960).

where we used the default parameters listed in Table 1. For most
parameters, we ﬁnd that the Razin eﬀect is not relevant for the radio
emission, since νRz lies below the other characteristic absorption
frequencies, which we calculate below. A characteristic free-free
absorption frequency can also be deﬁned by τﬀ = 1. This is given
by
νﬀ = 0.134 r1/2T−3/4

Similarly, the synchrotron self-absorption frequency can be
calculated through αssa

the synchrotron self-absorption frequency νssa can be derived us-
ing the δ-function approximation for the single particle synchrotron
emissivity and the expressions of Ne and N(pp)

tribution is expected to be cooled down to Lorentz factors close to
the minimum one. For the sake of simplicity we, therefore, present

which is at least one order of magnitude lower than the free-free
absorption frequency given by eq. (83). The peak synchrotron lu-
minosity is thus expected at νﬀ, unless the density of the CSM is
much lower than what is considered here; in this case, however,
secondary electrons will not play a major role in the radio emis-
sion.

5.2 Synchrotron light curves

In this section we present analytical expressions for the power-
law decay index of the optically thin synchrotron ﬂux, using the
δ-function approximation for the single particle synchrotron emis-
sivity. Starting from relations that apply to the cooled part of the
electron distribution (γ > γc) with s = 2, we ﬁnd the optically thin
synchrotron luminosity at ν > νc to be

for shock-accelerated primary electrons, and

for secondary electrons. For the derivation of the above, we made
use of eqs. (69) and (70). Moreover, eq. (89) and eq. (91) are de-
rived for the case where the evolution of the proton distribution is
dictated by adiabatic losses, which holds for most shock radii (see
discussion after eq. (52)).

The power-law index of the optically thin synchrotron light
curves depends on the temporal evolution of the shock velocity and
on the CSM density proﬁle. Interestingly, for the default choice of
w = 2 and α = 0, the synchrotron ﬂux due to accelerated electrons
is expected to be constant or slightly decaying as r−1/2 depending on
whether ν > νc or ν < νc, respectively. If the secondary synchrotron
radiation dominates in the radio frequencies, the light curve will
decay faster due to the decreasing injection rate. We also note that
the radial dependences presented in eqs. (88)-(91) apply also to
cases where the accelerated distributions have s > 2.
A simple relation between the power-law decay exponents of
the primary (t−χ1) and secondary (t−χ2) synchrotron light curves can

where we made use of eqs. (88) - (91) and the relation t ∝ r1−α. The
transition from primary-dominated to secondary-dominated syn-
chrotron emission at a given frequency band will be associated with
a change in the decay slope of the radio light curve. Interestingly,
the change ∆χ ≡ χ2 − χ1 is independent of the electron cooling
regime, namely
w − 1 + α
1 − α

∆χ =

.

Thus, the predicted break in the light curve for a wind-type CSM
and a constant shock velocity is ∆χ = 1. This break should be
observable as long as the synchrotron luminosities of primary and
secondary electrons are comparable at the transition time. As we
show next (see e.g. Fig. 6), this condition is satisﬁed at high fre-
quencies (> 100 GHz) and early times.

5.3 Synchrotron peak luminosity

We present next the expressions for the peak synchrotron luminos-
ity, whenever νﬀ is the peak frequency. Although these are not ap-
plicable in all cases, e.g. if νssa > νﬀ, they can be used as a quick ref-
erence whenever the mass loading parameter that is inferred from
the observations is (cid:38) 1014 gr cm−1.

The respective peak luminosities can be obtained by inserting

νﬀ in the expressions of Sect. 5.2. These are given by

A few things worth commenting follow:

• the radial dependence of the peak luminosity is diﬀerent if the
synchrotron emission is dominated by primary or secondary elec-
trons. In particular, for the case of a CSM wind density proﬁle and

a constant shock velocity, we ﬁnd Lpk,νﬀ >νc ∝ r3/2(cid:16)

Kep and υ0. As the shock velocity at breakout can be inferred from
observations (e.g. Waxman et al. 2007; Katz et al. 2010), the tran-
sition time from secondary to primary synchrotron emission, at

6 THE EFFECTS OF MODEL PARAMETERS

In the following paragraphs we investigate the eﬀect of the most
important model parameters (B, α, υ0, and w) on the radio spectra
and light curves. Each case will be compared against the default one
with parameters summarized in Table 1. The results that follow are
numerically calculated based on the formalism presented in Sect. 3
and should be compared to the analytical expressions derived in the
previous sections.

6.1 The role of B
Figure 5 shows snapshots of the synchrotron spectra including the
Razin suppression, synchrotron self-absorption, and free-free ab-
sorption, which is the dominant absorption process for the consid-
ered radii. Top and bottom panels are obtained for B = 10−2 and
10−4, respectively. In both cases we ﬁnd that at early times the syn-
chrotron emission from the SN shock is dominated by the emission
of secondaries electrons, whereas the opposite situation is realized
at late times. For B = 10−2 ( top panel), the spectral index of the
optically thin synchrotron spectrum is β = s/2 = 1 (Lν ∝ ν−β) at
all radii, regardless whether the emission is dominated by primary

Figure 5. Snapshots of the synchrotron spectra (thick black lines) calculated
for a wind-like CSM density proﬁle (w = 2) with mass loading parameter
Aw = 1016 g cm−1 and a constant shock velocity υ0 = 0.03c, after taking
into account the Razin suppression, synchrotron self-absorption, and free-
free absorption due to an electron plasma with temperature Te = 105 K.
Top and bottom panels are obtained for B = 10−2 and 10−4, respectively.
The contribution of the primary (blue dashed-dotted lines) and secondary
(red dashed lines) electrons to the total synchrotron emission is also shown.
The proton synchrotron contribution is negligible and for that reason not
shown. For the ﬂux conversion, a luminosity distance dL = 40 Mpc was
assumed. For the other parameters, see Table 1.

or secondary electrons. The bottom panel of Fig. 5 illustrates the
eﬀect of a lower value of B on the synchrotron spectra. At early
times, the magnetic ﬁeld is still strong enough for the electrons
to cool, thus leading to a spectral index β = s/2 = 1. At later
times though, synchrotron cooling becomes less eﬃcient and the
synchrotron spectral index becomes β = (s − 1)/2 = 1/2. The tran-
sition between the two cooling regimes is evident in the spectra of
both primary and secondary electrons. In both cases, however, the
spectral slope alone cannot be used to diﬀerentiate between primary
and secondary synchrotron radiation, unless the shock-accelerated
proton and electron distributions have diﬀerent power-law slopes at
injection. We note also that the peak luminosity in the right panel
remains constant during the transition from secondary-dominated
to primary-dominated synchrotron emission.

The radio light curves for the cases exempliﬁed in Fig. 5 have
been calculated at three characteristic frequencies (1000, 100 and
10 GHz) and presented in Fig. 6 (from top to bottom). The transi-
tion from secondary-dominated to primary-dominated synchrotron

ues given by eqs. (88) and (89), while χ1,2 approach the asymptotic
values 0.5 and 1.5, respectively, for B = 10−4. Small deviations
from the analytical predictions are expected, since these are valid
asymptotically, i.e. the distribution of electrons radiating at a given
radio frequency should be described as γ−s or γ−s−1.

6.2 The role of Aw
To exemplify the role of the mass loading parameter we calculated
the 10 GHz radio light curves for the default case of a wind-type
CSM (w = 2) and a constant shock velocity (α = 0). The results for
Aw ranging between 1015 gr cm−1 and 1017 gr cm−1 are presented
in Fig. 7. The light curves of the primary (dashed-dotted lines) and
secondary (dashed lines) synchrotron emission at the chosen fre-
quency are also shown. The calculations have been performed up
to deceleration radius, which increases for lower values of Aw (see
eq. (7)). Both the peak synchrotron luminosity and peak time in-
crease for higher Aw values. The latter is the result of a higher
free-free absorption frequency due to the denser CSM. This also
leads to a higher magnetic ﬁeld strength and a higher particle injec-
tion rate, which explains the increase of the peak luminosity. As Aw
increases, the contribution of secondary electrons to the observed
emission becomes larger, since the dependence of the secondary in-
jection rate Q(pp)
on the CSM density is stronger (see e.g. eqs. (15),
e
(19) and (38)).

6.3 The role of υ0
The shock-breakout velocity υ0 may be indirectly inferred from the
optical light curves (rise time and peak luminosity) of interaction-
powered SNe (e.g. Ofek et al. 2014b). As typical values lie in the
range 5 × 103 − 104 km s−1 (Ofek et al. 2014a), we have so far pre-
sented results for υ0 = 0.03c (9×103 km s−1). Here, we demonstrate
the eﬀects of the shock velocity at breakout on the radio light curves
by adopting υ0 = 0.1c (3 × 104 km s−1)14. As illustrated in Fig. 8,
higher shock velocities result in more luminous radio emission (see
also eqs. (93)-(96)). This can be understood as an increase of the
magnetic ﬁeld strength and of the post-shock thermal energy den-
sity (see e.g. eq. (15)). Slower shocks, on the other hand, favour the
production of secondary electrons, in agreement with the analyti-
cal predictions (Sect. 2.2). The transition time between secondary-
dominated to primary-dominated synchrotron emission is strongly
dependent on the shock velocity; for υ0 = 0.1c the transition oc-
curs at ∼ 10 d, whereas secondaries dominate the 100 GHz radio
emission until 103 d for υ0 = 0.03c.

14 Such fast shocks are often inferred for SNe associated with GRBs (e.g.
Soderberg et al. 2010; Margutti et al. 2013).

Figure 6. Radio light curves (thick solid lines) calculated at 1000 GHz,
100 GHz, and 10 GHz (from top to bottom) for the cases presented in
Fig. 5. Black and red colored lines correspond to B = 10−2 and B = 10−4,
respectively. Diﬀerent types of lines show the contribution of primary and
secondary electrons to the total synchrotron emission, as indicated in the
legend. All other parameters used are listed in Table 1.

emission is demonstrated by a change in the decay slope of the light
curve at 1000 GHz and 100 GHz. Moreover, the time of the tran-
sition does not depend on B. All these features are in agreement
with our analytical predictions in Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3.

The power-law decay indices, whenever these can be deﬁned,
of the primary and secondary synchrotron ﬂuxes are listed in Ta-
ble 2. These should be compared to the analytical predictions for
α = 0, namely χ1 = 0 and χ2 = 1 (χ1 = 0.5 and χ2 = 1.5, re-
spectively) for ν > νc (ν < νc, respectively). Indeed, for B = 10−2
we ﬁnd that the numerically derived indices are closer to the val-

calculation of the radio ﬂux, a source at a ﬁducial distance of 10 Mpc was
adopted. All other parameters used are listed in Table 1. Here, the ejecta
mass was assumed to be 5M(cid:12).

6.4 The role of Te
The free-free absorption frequency is sensitive to the temperature
of the upstream ionized CSM (νﬀ ∝ T−3/4
). This is exempliﬁed in
Fig. 9, where the 100 GHz and 10 GHz light curves are plotted for
Te = 105 (black, blue lines) and 104 K (red, orange lines). A lower
temperature shifts the peak time to later times, thus decreasing the
time interval where the contribution of secondaries to the observed
emission is signiﬁcant. In particular, at 10 GHz the radio emission
is expected to be dominated by the synchrotron emission of primary
electrons at all times, unless Te (cid:38) 104 K (see blue and orange lines).

6.5 The role of α

For speciﬁc combinations of the ejecta and CSM density proﬁles,
a weakly decelerating SN shock (α (cid:46) 0) is a viable outcome

(Chevalier 1982; Berger et al. 2002; Soderberg et al. 2008, 2010;
Chakraborti et al. 2015; Kamble et al. 2014c, 2015a; Fransson et al.
1996). The radio light curves at 10 GHz, 100 GHz and 1000 GHz
for α = −0.2 are presented in Fig. 10. In each panel, the respec-
tive light curves calculated for α = 0 are overplotted for a direct
comparison. In both cases, the radio light curves of secondary syn-
chrotron emission decay faster compared to those of primary syn-
chrotron radiation. The total synchrotron luminosity is lower in the
case of a weakly decelerating shock, since the injection rate of pro-
tons and, in turn, electrons decreases. It is also notable that in the
case of α < 0, the secondary electrons contribute almost 100% to
the total emission until late times, for observing frequencies as low
as 10 GHz. At a given time, the weakly decelerating shock will be
located at a smaller distance than that traveled by a shock mov-
ing with constant velocity, thus probing a dense CSM even at late
times.

7 RELEVANCE TO SN RADIO OBSERVATIONS

Several dozens of SNe within the local Universe (luminosity dis-
tance dL < 200 Mpc) have been detected in radio frequencies (see
Chevalier & Fransson 2006 and Fig. 6 in Kamble et al. 2015a).
All of these successful detections involve core-collapse SNe of all
types with no detection of type Ia SN so far (see e.g. Chomiuk et al.
(2015) and references therein).

The SN radio luminosity has a wide distribution arising pri-
marily from the dispersion in progenitor mass-loss rates and SN
shock velocities. The measured mass-loss rates of type Ibc SNe,
which are related to compact massive Wolf-Rayet stars, are low
( ˙Mw ∼ 10−6 − 10−5 M(cid:12)/yr) with typical wind velocities υw =
1000 km s−1. With such low mass-loss rates these SN shocks can-
not be powered by interaction with previously ejected matter from
the progenitor. Thus, their wide range in luminosity could be at-
tributed to the wide dispersion of their shock velocities. Indeed, the
shocks in SNe Ibc are among the fastest ranging from β (cid:39) 0.1− 0.5
(Kamble et al. 2014a).

Core collapse SNe due to their massive supergiant progenitors,
such as type II SNe, are the best candidates for interaction-powered
SNe. Progenitor mass-loss rates in SNe IIn can be as high as ˙Mw ∼
10−3 M(cid:12)/yr, while their stellar winds are typically slow with υw =
10 km s−1). Radio observations of type IIn SNe show evidence of

Yam et al. 2009; Quimby et al. 2011). Such an interaction scenario
requires unprecedentedly high mass-loss rates for the SN progeni-
tors, approaching ˙Mw ∼ 1 M(cid:12)/yr. Only a few attempts to observe
the radio emission from SLSNe have been made without any detec-
tion so far (Chomiuk et al. 2011, 2012). Currently, it is not clear if
there is a physical reason behind the absence of a radio signal or if
it is an observational eﬀect due to the large distances of SLSNe.

7.1 Synchrotron peak luminosity vs. peak time

It is instructive to view our results on the peak synchrotron lumi-
nosities of primaries and secondaries in the context of radio SNe
observations. The peak luminosity versus peak time plot oﬀers the
most informative way to project the radio SNe (Chevalier 1998;
Chevalier & Fransson 2006; Kamble et al. 2015b). The peak time
tpk corresponds to the time when the peak synchrotron frequency,
namely νpk ≡ max(νﬀ, νssa), crosses a ﬁxed observing frequency
(ν). For the parameter values we are interested in, it is safe to as-
sume that νpk = νﬀ. For the case of a wind-type CSM medium and
a constant shock velocity, this happens at a shock radius
rpk ∝ A2/3
w ν
while the respective peak time is expressed as
tpk ∝ A2/3
(102)
w β
We remark that both the peak time and radius depend on Aw:
a denser CSM shifts tpk to later times, having important conse-
quences for the relative importance of secondary versus primary
synchrotron emission. Moreover, the peak time is inversely propor-
tional to the shock velocity, for a given mass loading parameter.

In the following, we assume that the electrons radiating at the
peak synchrotron frequency belong to the cooled part of the dis-
tribution. The primary and secondary synchrotron luminosities at
ν = νpk can be obtained by substitution of eqs. (101)-(102) into
eqs. (93) and (94). Our results are summarized in Fig. 11 where the
maximum of Lpk,νﬀ >νc (colored circles) and L(pp)
pk,νﬀ >νc (colored trian-
gles) is plotted as a function of tpk. Measurements of radio SNe of
various types (for details, see ﬁgure caption) are overplotted with
ﬁlled and open black symbols. As most observations are performed
at the 5 GHz frequency band, the results shown in Fig. 11 are ob-
tained for ν = 5 GHz. The two colored curves are obtained from the
semi-analytical model for υ0 = 0.1c and 0.03c, as marked on the
plot. The color coding corresponds to the value of the mass loading
parameter Aw (see eq. (2)), as indicated in the color bar at the top.
The black solid line is the locus of points with Lpk,νﬀ >νc
pk,νﬀ >νc.
It divides the plot in two regions where the peak luminosity at
νpk = 5 GHz and tpk is expected to be dominated by secondary
(right to the line) or primary (left to the line) electrons. It is intrigu-
ing that the model-derived curve for β0 = 0.03c and Aw (cid:38) 1016 gr
cm−1 passes close to most of the type IIn observations (ﬁlled dia-
monds), suggesting that the peak synchrotron luminosity is domi-
nated by the radiation of secondary electrons. Type IIn SNe could
be therefore serve as candidate sources for the detection of hadronic
acceleration in SN shocks.

= L(pp)

Higher values of the mass loading parameter push the peak
synchrotron luminosity (independently from the nature of radi-
ating electrons) to higher values. As noted previously, the pas-
sage of νpk across the 5 GHz frequency band happens at later
times as Aw increases. Our results suggest that it is possible to
probe the emission from secondaries with observations at 5 GHz
if tpk (cid:39) 300 − 1000 days for shock velocities υ0 = 0.03c − 0.1c and
dense CSM with Aw (cid:38) 1016 − 1017 gr cm−1.

The steep slope of the black solid line in Fig. 11 (that indi-

Assuming that p and Te are known parameters and using eqs. (5),
(93), (83) and (98), it can be shown that
Lpk,eq ∝ t6
Interestingly, Lpk,eq depends only on a single parameter related to
the acceleration process, that is Kep. The determination of the lat-
ter could be, therefore, possible if Lpk,eq, tpk,eq and ν were indepen-
dently inferred from the observations. For example, a ﬂattening of
the light curve at ν = νpk by ∆χ = 1 would denote tpk,eq, as illus-
trated in Figs. 6 and 10.

8 DISCUSSION

We have presented a semi-analytical model for calculating the tem-
poral evolution of primary and secondary particle distributions in
the post-shock region of a SN forward shock propagating in a dense
CSM. With the adopted formalism we were able to track the cool-
ing history of all particles, which have been injected into the emis-
sion region up to a given radius, and to calculate the respective
non-thermal radio emission. We have focused on the early phases

of the SN evolution (i.e., before the Sedov phase) by presenting ra-
dio spectra and light curves for times prior to the deceleration time.
The semi-analytical formalism can be, however, easily extended to
the Sedov phase by adopting the adequate power-law index for the
radial velocity proﬁle. The light curves are expected to be steeper
than those presented here, while at these later times, observations
will probe the primary electron distribution.

So far, we have not discussed the origin of the magnetic ﬁeld
in the post-shock region of the SN shock. As the magnetic ﬁeld
of the unshocked progenitor wind is expected to be weak15, mag-
netic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation is required for the particle acceleration.
Non-resonant two-stream instabilities driven by cosmic-ray protons
propagating ahead of the shock have been proposed as the ampliﬁ-
cation process (e.g. Bell & Lucek 2001; Bell 2004, 2005; Caprioli
& Spitkovsky 2014b; Cardillo et al. 2015). We caution, however,
that if the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld of the unshocked CSM is pref-
erentially toroidal, the resulting shock will be quasi-perpendicular
(i.e., with the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the shock normal),
and particle acceleration will be ineﬃcient. Thus, the relevant as-
sumption is that the unshocked CSM ﬁeld is weak or radial (e.g.
Sironi et al. 2013; Caprioli & Spitkovsky 2014a), which may be,
however, questionable.

We have mostly focused on the case of a SN shock expand-
ing in a smooth progenitor wind. However, our calculations are ap-
plicable to a generic CSM density proﬁle. The environment of the
progenitor star does not always have a smooth density proﬁle. Den-
sity enhancements in the CSM may occur due to various reasons,
such as variable stellar winds and interactions with the companion
star, in case of a binary system. Interaction of the shock wave with
such density enhancements would result in radio light curves ex-
hibiting sudden and abrupt enhancements in (or dimming of) their
brightness. Indeed, several radio SNe have been observed to show
such features as early as a few weeks to as late as several months.
Some examples of extreme variability include SN 1996cr (Bauer
et al. 2008; Meunier et al. 2013), 2001em (Schinzel et al. 2009),
2003gk, 2004cc, 2004dk, 2004gq (Wellons et al. 2012), 2007bg
(Salas et al. 2013), PTF11qcj (Corsi et al. 2014) and SN 2014C
(Kamble et al. 2014b). Depending on the width and the mass of
the intervening shell, the interaction of the shock wave with the
shell could complicate the dynamics of the interaction (Chevalier
& Liang 1989; Dwarkadas 2005, 2007; Chugai & Chevalier 2006;
Pan et al. 2013). Provided that the shock velocity can still be ap-
proximated as a power-law in radius and that the emission from the
reverse shock is negligible, our formalism may still be employed to
assess the radio synchrotron emission resulting from the interaction
of the SN shock with a dense shell of uniform density.

Currently, the modelling of radio SNe involves the emission
from primary electrons that are accelerated in the vicinity of the
SN shock. We explicitly showed that secondary electrons may
contribute signiﬁcantly to the observed radio synchrotron emis-
sion, with their contribution becoming more important at higher
radio frequencies (i.e. (cid:38) 10 − 100 GHz), for denser CSM (e.g.
Aw (cid:38) 1016 gr cm−1) and lower shock velocities (e.g. υ0 (cid:46) 104 km
s−1). As the radio brightness of the SN shock depends mainly on
its radius and the number of radiating electrons, the inclusion of
secondary electrons in the emission process could result in dif-
ferent estimates of the physical parameters, such as the mass-loss

on the stellar surface (e.g. Barvainis et al. 1987) and r(cid:63) is the stellar radius.

rate and/or the shock radius. The latter could be measured indepen-
dently with high angular resolution imaging (e.g., Very Large Base-
line Interferometry – VLBI) of nearby bright young SNe; this has
been successfully carried out for about a dozen SNe and GRBs (Bi-
etenholz 2014; Pihlstr¨om et al. 2007; Taylor et al. 2004). Since the
derived physical parameters from the synchrotron emission model
depend on various microphysical parameters (e.g., Kep and p), in-
dependent radius measurements with VLBI observations could po-
tentially constrain the synchrotron model (de Witt et al. 2016). Con-
sidering that the secondary electrons would contribute signiﬁcantly
at early times, a nearby bright and young SN will be a good candi-
date for direct assessment of this eﬀect.
A robust prediction of our model is the ﬂattening of the radio
light curve by ∆χ = (w−1+α)/(1−α) at high radio frequencies (i.e.
(cid:38) 10 − 100 GHz) during the transition from secondary-dominated
to primary-dominated synchrotron emission. Interestingly, ∆χ is
the same for all frequencies above or below the cooling break fre-
quency. The change in the decay slope of the light curve is expected
to be smooth (see e.g. left panels in Figs. 6 and 10). The transition
time at the peak frequency should lie in the range ∼ 6 − 60 d (∼
60−600 d, respectively) for υ0 = 3 × 104 km s−1
(υ0 = 9 × 103
km s−1, respectively) and Aw ∼ 3 × 1015 − 3 × 1016 gr cm−1 (see
also Fig. 7), while the peak frequency is, respectively, expected at
∼ 18 − 56 GHz (3-10 GHz). However, it is not trivial to search for
such breaks in existing radio data, especially if the shock is fast .
The reason being that most of the radio observations are typically
performed at 5-10 GHz, while some of the brightest SNe have been
observed at higher frequencies, e.g. 40 GHz. The Atacama Large
Millimeter Array (ALMA), with signiﬁcant improvement in sensi-
tivity in the millimeter waveband, would be an ideal telescope for
the early detection of the SNe and the precise estimate of the sec-
ondary electron contribution to the SN brightness. ALMA would
also be able to search for the predicted light curve ﬂattening due to
the rapid decline of the secondary electrons, thus providing a direct
test of the model.

9 SUMMARY

We have investigated the role of inelastic pp collisions as the SN
shock sweeps through the dense CSM, focusing on the radio sig-
natures from secondary electrons that are produced in the decay
chain of charged pions. We have presented a semi-analytical one-
zone model for calculating the temporal evolution of primary and
secondary particle distributions in the post-shock region of the SN
forward shock. With the adopted formalism, we were able to track
the cooling history of all particles that have been injected into the
emission region up to a given time, and calculated the radio spec-
tra and light curves. These, upon comparison to the observations,
can be used to constrain the acceleration eﬃciency of protons and
electrons in fast supernova shocks.

We showed that, for a given SN shock expanding in a wind-
like medium, secondary electrons control the early radio signatures,
but their contribution decays faster than that of primary electrons,
which dominate at later times. We derived the decay slope of radio
light curves in the case of secondary-dominated (t−χ2) and primary-
dominated (t−χ1) synchrotron emission and showed that, at a given
frequency, a break of ∆χ = χ2 − χ1 = (w − 1 + α)/(1 − α) is
expected during the transition between the two regimes. This sim-
pliﬁes to ∆χ = 1 for the case of wind-type CSM and a constant
shock velocity. The transition time at the peak frequency, in par-
ticular, was found to depend only on the mass-loading parameter

servations performed at high frequencies ∼ 3 − 60 GHz and at
times ∼ 6 − 600 d may be used to probe the presence of secondary
electrons for shocks with υ0 = 9 × 103 − 3 × 104 km s−1 and dense
CSM (Aw ∼ 3×1015−3×1016 gr cm−1). Besides the transition time,
the peak time of the light curve at a given observing frequency was
also shown to be a strong predictor of the relative role of secondary
versus primary electrons. We showed that early peak times imply a
low-density CSM and a primary-dominated synchrotron emission.
Late peak times (i.e., tpk (cid:38) 250 − 1000 d) at 5 GHz, on the con-
trary, suggest a fast (υ0 = 9 × 103 − 3 × 104 km s−1) shock wave
propagating in a dense medium (Aw (cid:38) 1016 − 1017 gr cm−1), where
secondary electrons are likely to power the peak ﬂux.

APPENDIX A: MINIMUM MOMENTUM OF
ACCELERATED PARTICLES
For typical velocities of early supernovae, υs ∼ 104 km s−1, the
thermal momentum of post-shock ions will be pth,p ∼ mpυs, where
factors of order unity are dropped. Thus, the bulk of the shocked
ions will be non-relativistic. Recent hybrid and fully-kinetic simu-
lations (e.g. Park et al. 2015) suggest that the power law of acceler-
ated particles starts at pp,m ∼ 3pth,p, namely the minimum momen-
tum of the power-law distribution still falls in the non-relativistic
regime. For a power-law distribution in momentum with power-
law index 2 < s < 3 extending from pp,m up to ultra-relativistic
energies most of the kinetic energy is carried by particles having
γ ∼ 2. On the contrary, for s > 3, most of the energy is contributed
by particles at pp,m. In fact, if x = γ − 1, the particle distribution is
dN/dx ∝ x−(s+1)/2 for x (cid:28) 1 and the usual dN/dx ∝ x−s for x (cid:29) 1.
Indeed, for 2 < s < 3 the peak of x2dN/dx, i.e., where most of the
energy resides, occurs at x ∼ 1, or equivalently γ ∼ 2. Throughout
the present study we assume that 2 < s < 3. For a constant (or
mildly decelerating) shock velocity, as expected in the free expan-
sion phase, the injection momentum pp,m does not change over time
(or slightly decreases), which implies that the fraction of energy in
non-relativistic – yet, non-thermal – protons, relative to the bulk of
the particles, does not change (signiﬁcantly) over time. Therefore,
the assumption that a constant fraction of shock energy is channeled
into non-thermal protons (either non-relativistic or relativistic) im-
plies that a constant fraction of shock energy (p, in our formalism)
is channeled into ultra-relativistic protons.

We turn now to the lower integration limit rmin, which is given by
rmin ≡ max[rcr, rin]. For γ (cid:29) γc it can be shown that rmin = rcr,
whereas rmin = rin for γ (cid:28) γc. For most parameter values and
at the early phases of the SN shock evolution, the radio emitting
electrons belong to the cooled part of the spectrum (γ > γc). For
high values of Aw, in particular, the electron distribution may cool
due to synchrotron losses down to γ ∼ γe,m. Substitution of the
high-γ branch in eq. (C6) to eq. (C3) leads to
Ne(γ, r) ≈ Q0erin

Interestingly, the number of accelerated electrons with a given
Lorentz factor does not dependent on the CSM density proﬁle, e.g.
Ne ∝ γ−3r2, for a constant shock velocity (α = 0). For γ (cid:28) γc, the
electron distribution is simply given by eq. (C3) with rmin = rin. We
remark that these results are valid as long as γc (cid:38) γe,m.

The above analysis can be directly applied to the secondary
electrons, using the appropriate expression for the injection rate,
which depends linearly on the distribution of relativistic protons
(see e.g. eqs. (31) and (32)). The evolution of the proton distribu-
tion can be explicitly calculated for the generic injection proﬁle of
eq. (15), if it is dictated by the adiabatic losses (i.e., the catastrophic
loss term in eq. (48) can be neglected). This is a good assumption,
for all radii r (cid:38) 10w+α−1β
(see discussion after eq. (52)). In
this case, the proton distribution is given by

The synchrotron luminosity Lν in the optically thin regime scales
as Ne(r)B(r)(s(cid:48)+1)/2 (see e.g. Rybicki & Lightman 1979), where s(cid:48) =
s + 1, if the emitting electrons belong to the cooled part of the
distribution (γ (cid:29) γc) and s(cid:48) = s, otherwise. Using eq. (11) and
eq. (C8) for s = 2 we ﬁnd
Lν(r) ∝ r2−w+3α, or
Lν(t) ∝ t(2−w+3α)/(1−α).
If the luminosity at the particular frequency is dominated by sec-
ondary synchrotron emission, we ﬁnd using eq. (11) and eq. (C12)
that

APPENDIX D: COMPARISON OF THERMAL AND
NON-THERMAL ENERGY DENSITIES

For certain SNe types that are characterized by a dense CSM,
the shock breakout is expected to take place within the progeni-
tor’s wind. After the shock breakout a collisionless shock may be
formed, thus allowing the acceleration of particles (Katz et al. 2011;
Murase et al. 2011). The X-ray photons produced at the shock soon
after the shock breakout will be Compton down-scattered and ther-
malized, since τT ∼ c/υs = 10−30 at shock breakout (e.g. Chevalier
& Irwin 2011; Svirski et al. 2012). As long as τT (cid:38) 1, the energy
density of thermal radiation may be written as (see e.g. Murase
et al. 2014):

where ξr is the fraction of the SN kinetic luminosity Lk that emerges
as thermal radiation and τT = (c/υ0) (rin/r)w−1. Typical values of
e ∼
the thermal electron temperature in the shocked CSM are T (d)
108 − 109 K, although the exact values depend on whether ther-
mal equilibrium between ions and electrons was achieved, or not
e (cid:38) 2 × 107 K, then thermal elec-
(Fransson et al. 1996). If T (d)
trons cool via thermal bremsstrahlung, producing X-ray radiation.
Hard ((cid:38) 1−2 keV) X-rays can escape without severe attenuation, if
τT (cid:46) 1. For a wind-like density proﬁle (w = 2), the energy density
of X-ray photons is given by

where we used eq. (5.15b) by Rybicki & Lightman (1979), assum-
ing an ionized CSM composed of pure hydrogen. It is interesting
to compare Ur,th and UX,ﬀ with the non-thermal particle and mag-
netic energy densities in the downstream region of the SN forward
shock. This is exempliﬁed in Fig. D1 for Lk = 1042 erg s−1, ξr = 0.1
and T (d)
e = 108 K. All other parameters are the same as in Fig. 4. At
least for this indicative example, it is the magnetic energy density
c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

that dominates over Ur,th and UX,ﬀ at almost all radii. Thus, syn-
chrotron cooling is expected to be the main energy loss process for
electrons. Yet, the aforementioned radiation ﬁelds can, in princi-
ple, contribute to electron cooling via inverse Compton scattering.
Ur,th turns out to be a more important source for electron cooling,
since most of the inverse Compton scatterings between the elec-
trons and X-ray bremsstrahlung photons take place in the Klein-
Nishina regime. We note that these additional cooling channels for
electrons were not taken into account in our calculations; we would
have to rely on many assumptions regarding the thermal processes,
which were not the focus of this study.
