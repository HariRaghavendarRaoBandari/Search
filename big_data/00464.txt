We consider the possibility that the black-hole (BH) binary detected by LIGO may be a signature
of dark matter. Interestingly enough, there remains a window for masses 10 M(cid:12) (cid:46) Mbh (cid:46) 100 M(cid:12)
where primordial black holes (PBHs) may constitute the dark matter.
If two BHs in a galactic
halo pass suﬃciently close, they can radiate enough energy in gravitational waves to become grav-
itationally bound. The bound BHs will then rapidly spiral inward due to emission of gravitational
radiation and ultimately merge. Uncertainties in the rate for such events arise from our imprecise
knowledge of the phase-space structure of galactic halos on the smallest scales. Still, reasonable
estimates span a range that overlaps the 2 − 53 Gpc−3 yr−1 rate estimated from GW150914, thus
raising the possibility that LIGO has detected PBH dark matter. PBH mergers are likely to be
distributed spatially more like dark matter than luminous matter and have no optical nor neutrino
counterparts. They may be distinguished from mergers of BHs from more traditional astrophysical
sources through the observed mass spectrum, their high ellipticities, or their stochastic gravitational
wave background. Next generation experiments will be invaluable in performing these tests.

The nature of the dark matter (DM) is one of the
most longstanding and puzzling questions in physics.
Cosmological measurements have now determined with
exquisite precision the abundance of DM [1, 2], and we
know from a combination of observations and numerical
simulations quite a bit about its distribution in Galactic
halos. Still, the nature of the DM remains a mystery.
Given the eﬃcacy with which weakly-interacting mas-
sive particles—for many years the favored particle-theory
explanation—have eluded detection, it may be warranted
to consider other possibilities for DM. Primordial black
holes (PBHs) are one such possibility [3, 4].

Here we consider whether the two ∼ 30 M(cid:12) black holes
detected by LIGO [5] could plausibly be PBHs. There is
a window for PBHs to be DM if the BH mass is in the
range 10 M(cid:12) (cid:46) M (cid:46) 100 M(cid:12) [6, 7]. Lower masses are
excluded by microlensing surveys [8], and higher masses
would disrupt wide binaries [7, 9, 10].
It has been ar-
gued that PBHs in this mass range are excluded by cos-
mic microwave background (CMB) constraints [11, 12].
However, these constraints require modeling of several
complex physical processes, including the accretion of gas
onto a moving BH, the conversion of the accreted mass to
a luminosity, the self-consistent feedback of the BH radi-
ation on the accretion process, and the deposition of the
radiated energy as heat in the photon-baryon plasma. A
signiﬁcant (and diﬃcult to quantify) uncertainty should
therefore be associated with this upper limit, and it seems
worthwhile to examine whether PBHs in this mass range
could have other observational consequences.

In this Letter, we show that if DM consists of ∼ 30 M(cid:12)
BHs, then the rate for mergers of such PBHs falls within
the merger rate inferred from GW150914. In any galac-
tic halo, there is some small chance that two BHs will
undergo a hard scatter and in so doing lose energy to a
soft gravitational wave (GW) burst and thereby become

gravitationally bound. This binary will then merge via
emission of GWs in less than a Hubble time. Below we
ﬁrst estimate roughly the rate of such mergers and then
present the results of more detailed calculations. We then
discuss uncertainties in the calculation and some possible
ways to distinguish PBHs from BH binaries from more
traditional astrophysical sources.

Consider two PBHs that approach each other with
some impact parameter on a hyperbolic orbit, with rel-
ative velocity vpbh. When the PBHs deﬂect each other,
there is a time-varying quadrupole moment and thus GW
emission. The PBH pair becomes gravitationally bound
if the GW emission is greater than the initial kinetic en-
ergy. The cross section for this process is [13, 14],

tive velocity in units of 200 km sec−1.

We begin with a rough but simple and illustrative es-
timate of the rate per unit volume of such mergers. Sup-
pose that all DM matter in the Universe resided in Milky-
Way like halos of mass M = M12 1012 M(cid:12) and uniform
mass density ρ = 0.002 ρ0.002 M(cid:12) pc−3 with ρ0.002 ∼ 1.
The rate of mergers per halo, assuming a uniform-density
halo of volume V = M/ρ, would then be

where the relative velocity vpbh−200 is speciﬁed by a char-
acteristic halo velocity. The mean cosmic DM mass den-
sity is ρdm (cid:39) 3.6 × 1010 M(cid:12) Mpc−3, and so the spatial

The factor M12 drops out, as it should. The merger rate
per unit volume also does not depend on the PBH mass,
a consequence of the dependence of the capture cross
section on M 2
This rate is small compared with the 2−53 Gpc−3 yr−1
estimated by LIGO for a population of ∼ 30 M(cid:12)− 30 M(cid:12)
mergers [15], but it is a very conservative estimate. As
Eq. (3) indicates, the merger rate is higher in higher-
density regions and also in regions of lower DM velocity
dispersion. The DM in Milky-Way like halos is known
from simulations [16] and analytic models [17] to have
substructure, regions of higher density and lower veloc-
ity dispersion. DM halos also have a broad mass spec-
trum, extending to very low masses where the densities
can become far higher, and velocity dispersion far lower,
than in the Milky Way. To get a very rough estimate
of the conceivable increase in the PBH merger rate due
to these smaller-scale structures, we can replace ρ and
v in Eq. (3) by the values they would have had in the
earliest generation of collapsed objects, where the DM
densities would have been largest and velocity disper-
sions the smallest. If the primordial power spectrum is
nearly scale invariant, then gravitationally bound halos
of mass Mc ∼ 500 M(cid:12), for example, will form at red-
shift zc (cid:39) 28 − log10(Mc/500 M(cid:12)). These objects will
have virial velocities v (cid:39) 0.2 km sec−1 and densities
ρ (cid:39) 0.24 M(cid:12) pc−3 [18]. Using these values in Eq. (3)
increases the merger rate per unit volume to

Γ (cid:39) 1400 Gpc−3 yr−1.

(4)

This would be the merger rate if all the DM resided in the
smallest haloes. Clearly, this is not true by the present
day; substructures are at the least partially stripped as
they merge to form larger objects in the hierarchy, and so
Eq. (4) should be viewed as a conservative upper limit.
Having demonstrated that rough estimates contain the
merger-rate range 2−53 Gpc−3 yr−1 suggested by LIGO,
we now turn to more careful estimates of the PBH merger
rate. As Eq. (3) suggests, the merger rate will depend on
a density-weighted average, over the entire cosmic DM
−11/7
distribution, of ρ0.002v
pbh−200. To perform this average,
we will (a) assume that DM is distributed within galactic
halos with a Navarro-Frenk-White proﬁle [19] with con-
centration parameters inferred from simulations; and (b)
try several halo mass functions taken from the literature
for the distribution of halos.

the
Navarro-Frenk-White density proﬁle with characteristic
radius and density rs and ρs, respectively. Rvir is the
virial radius, at which the NFW proﬁle reaches a value
200 times the comoving mean cosmic DM density and
is cutoﬀ. Here, Mpbh is the PBH mass and vpbh is the
relative velocity of two PBHs. The angle brackets de-
note an average over the PBH relative velocity distribu-
tion in the halo. The merger cross section σ is that in
Eq. (1). The concentration parameter C is C = Rvir/Rs.
To determine the proﬁle of each halo, we need to relate
C to the halo mass M . We will compare results using
concentration-mass relations from Ref. [20] and Ref. [21],
both ﬁt from DM N-body simulations.

We now turn to the average of the cross section times
relative velocity. The one-dimensional velocity dispersion
of a halo is deﬁned in terms of the escape velocity at
radius Rmax = 2.1626 Rs, the radius of the maximum
circular velocity of the halo; i.e.,

Eq. (1) gives the cross section for two PBHs to form a
binary. However, if the binary is to produce an observ-
able GW signal, these two PBHs must orbit and inspiral;
a direct collision, lacking an inspiral phase, is unlikely
to be detectable by LIGO. This requirement imposes a
minimum impact parameter of roughly the Schwarzchild
radius. The fraction of BHs which do not merge is ∼ v2/7

and reaches a maximum of ∼ 3% for a relative velocity
of 2000 km/s. Thus, direct mergers are negligible. We
also require that once the binary is formed, the time un-
til it merges (which can be obtained from Ref. [23]) is
less than a Hubble time. Due to the diﬀerent velocity
dispersion between halos of diﬀerent mass, the charac-
teristic time it takes for a binary BH to merge can be
hours for Mvir (cid:39) 1012 M(cid:12) to kyrs for Mvir (cid:39) 106 M(cid:12),
and thus eﬀectively instantaneous. Given the small size
of the binary, and rapid time to merger, disruption of
the binary, once formed, by a third PBH is negligible.
BH binaries can also form through non-dissipative three-
body encounters. The rate of these binary captures is
non-negligible in small halos [13, 24], but they generi-
cally lead to the formation of wide binaries that will not
be able to harden and merge within a Hubble time. This
formation mechanism should not aﬀect our LIGO rates.
The merger rate is therefore equal to the rate of binary
BH formation, Eq. (8).

Fig. 2 shows the contribution to the merger rate,
Eq. (8), for two concentration-mass relations. As can
be seen, the dependence on the particular concentration-
mass relation is quite small. An increase in halo mass
produces an increased PBH merger rate. However, less
massive halos have a higher concentration (since they are
more likely to have virialized earlier), so that the merger
rate per unit mass increases signiﬁcantly as the halo mass
is decreased.

To compute the expected LIGO event rate, we con-
volve the merger rate R per halo with the mass func-
tion dn/dM . Since the redshifts (z (cid:46) 0.3) detectable by
LIGO are relatively low we will neglect redshift evolution
in the halo mass function. The total merger rate per unit

(10)

Given the exponential falloﬀ of dn/dM at high masses,
despite the increased merger rate per halo suggested in
Fig. 1, the precise value of the upper limit of the inte-
grand does not aﬀect the ﬁnal result.

At the lower limit, discreteness in the DM particles
becomes important, and the NFW proﬁle is no longer a
good description of the halo proﬁle. Furthermore, the
smallest halos will evaporate due to periodic ejection of
objects by dynamical relaxation processes. The evapora-
tion timescale is [25]

tevap ≈ (14N / lnN ) [Rvir/(C vdm)] ,

(11)
where N is the number of individual BHs in the halo, and
we assumed that the PBH mass is 30 M(cid:12). For a halo of
mass 500 M(cid:12), the velocity dispersion is 0.2 km sec−1, and
the evaporation timescale is ∼ 5 Gyr. In practice, during
matter domination, halos which have already formed will
continuously grow through mergers or accretion. Evapo-
ration will thus be compensated by the addition of new
material, and as halos grow new halos will form from
mergers of smaller objects. However, during dark-energy
domination at z (cid:46) 0.3, 5 Gyr ago, this process slows
down. Thus, we will neglect the signal from halos with
an evaporation timescale less than 5 Gyr, corresponding
to M < 500 M(cid:12). This is in any case 13 PBHs, and thus
close to the point where the NFW proﬁle is no longer
valid.

The halo mass function dn/dM is computed using both
semi-analytic ﬁts to N-body simulations and with ana-
lytic approximations. Computing the merger rate in the
small halos discussed above requires us to extrapolate

relation around six orders of magnitude in mass beyond
the smallest halos present in the calibration simulations.
Note, however, that the mass functions depend on the
halo mass through the perturbation amplitude σ(Rvir) at
the virial radius Rvir of a given halo. Due to the scale in-
variance of the window functions on small scales, σ(Rvir)
varies only by a factor of two between Mvir = 109 M(cid:12) and
103 M(cid:12). Thus the extrapolation in the mass function is
less severe than it looks. We also note that the scale-
invariant nature of the initial conditions suggests that
the shape of the halo mass function should not evolve
unduly until it reaches the scale of the PBH mass, or
evaporation cutoﬀ.

To quantify the uncertainty induced by the dn/dM
extrapolation, we obtained results with two diﬀerent
mass functions: the classic analytic Press-Schechter cal-
culation [26] and one calibrated to numerical simula-
tions from Tinker et al. [27]. The agreement between
the two small-scale behaviors suggests that the small-
scale extrapolation of the numerical mass functions is
not as blind as it might otherwise seem. We also in-
clude a third mass function, due to Jenkins [28], that
includes an artiﬁcial small-scale mass cutoﬀ at a halo
mass Mvir ∼ 106 M(cid:12). This cutoﬀ is inserted to model,
roughly speaking, the mass function that arises if there is
no power on scales smaller than those that can somehow
currently be probed observationally. We include it to pro-
vide a very conservative lower limit to the merger rate if,
for some reason, small-scale power were suppressed. We
do not, however, consider it likely that this mass function
accurately represents the distribution of halo masses in
our Universe.

dominate the signal, due to the increase in concentra-
tion and decrease in velocity dispersion with smaller halo
masses. The Tinker mass function, which asymptotes to
a constant number density for small masses, produces the
most mergers. Press-Schechter has ∼ 50% fewer events
in small halos, while the Jenkins mass function results
in merger rates nearly four orders of magnitude smaller
(and in rough agreement with Eq. (3)).

We integrate the curves in Fig. 2 to compute the to-
tal merger rate V. All mass functions give a similar re-
sult, ∼ (4 ± 1) × 10−3 Gpc−3 yr−1, from halos of masses
(cid:38) 109 M(cid:12), which represents for the Tinker and Press-
Schechter mass function a small fraction of the events.
When we include all halos with Mvir > 500M(cid:12), the
number of events increases dramatically, and depends
strongly on the lower cutoﬀ mass Mc for the halo mass.
Both the Press-Schechter and Tinker mass functions are

plitude ∝ 1/σ(Rvir) at the virial radius Rvir of the col-

The concentration is also a function of 1/σ(Rvir) and it
too becomes roughly constant for small masses. Assum-
ing a constant concentration, the merger rate per halo
scales as R ∼ M 10/21. Thus, Eq. (10) suggests that
V ∼ M

tiation of Fig. 2, which yields V ∼ M−0.51

The integrated merger rate is thus

V = 5 f (Mc/500 M(cid:12))−11/21 Gpc−3 yr−1,

(13)
with f (cid:39) 1 for the Press-Schechter mass function, and
f (cid:39) 1.4 for the Tinker mass function (the Jenkins mass
function results in an event rate V (cid:39) 0.05 Gpc−3 yr−1,
independent of Mc (cid:46) 106M(cid:12)).

A variety of astrophysical processes may alter the mass
function in some halos, especially within the dwarf galaxy
range, 109 − 1010M(cid:12). However, halos with Mvir (cid:46)
109 M(cid:12) are too small to form stars against the ther-
mal pressure of the ionized intergalactic medium [29] and
are thus unlikely to be aﬀected by these astrophysical
processes. Inclusion of galactic substructure, which our
calculation neglects, should boost the results. However,
since the event rate is dominated by the smallest halos,
which should have little in the way of substructure, we
expect this to make negligible diﬀerence to our ﬁnal re-
sult. There is also the issue of the NFW density proﬁle
assumed. The results are fairly insensitive to the detailed
density proﬁle as long as the slope of the density proﬁle
as r → 0 is close to r−1. If, however, the inner proﬁle
increases more like ρ ∝ r−1.5, as some simulations sug-
gest [16], then the merger rates could be enhanced by
as much as an order of magnitude. Our assumption of
an isotropic MB-like velocity distribution in the halo may
also underestimate the correct answer, as any other veloc-
ity distribution would have lower entropy and thus larger
averaged v−11/7. Finally, our estimates assume a nearly
scale-invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations all
the way down to the ∼ 500 M(cid:12) mass scale. However, new
early-Universe physics that gives rise to PBHs is likely to
involve an enhancement of power on small scales. At the
bare minimum, the discreteness of PBH DM will pro-
vide some Poisson enhancement of power on ∼ 500 M(cid:12)
scales. More small-scale power would then lead to ear-
lier collapse and thus denser structures and probably an
enhancement, beyond Eq. (13), of the event rate.
The recent LIGO detection of two merging ∼ 30 M(cid:12)
black holes suggests a 90% C.L. event rate [15] of 2 −
53 Gpc−3 yr−1 if all mergers have the masses, ﬁnal spin,
and emitted energy of GW150914. It is interesting that—
although there are theoretical uncertainties—our best es-
timates of the merger rate for 30 M(cid:12) PBHs, obtained
with canonical models for the DM distribution, fall in
the LIGO window.

The possibility that LIGO has seen DM thus cannot be
immediately excluded. Even if the predicted merger rates
turn out, with more precise treatments of the small-scale
galactic phase-space distribution, to be smaller, conser-
vative lower estimates of the merger rate for PBH DM
suggests that the LIGO/VIRGO network should see a
considerable number of PBH mergers over its lifetime.

We have assumed a population of PBHs with the same
mass. The basic results obtained here should, how-
ever, remain unaltered if there is some small spread of
PBH masses, as expected from PBH-formation scenar-
ios, around the nominal value of 30 M(cid:12).

PBH mergers may

for
LIGO/VIRGO even if PBHs make up only a frac-
tion fpbh of the DM, as may be implied by Refs. [11, 12]
or the limits in Ref. [6]. In this case, the number density
of black holes will be reduced by fpbh. The cutoﬀ mass
will increase as Mc ∼ f−1
pbh if we continue to require
> 10 PBHs in each halo to avoid halo evaporation.
The overall event rate will be V ∼ 6f 53/21
pbh Gpc−3 yr−1.
Advanced LIGO will reach design sensitivity in 2019
[30, 31].
It will then probe z < 0.75, an increase in
volume to ≈ 500 Gpc3. Thus over the six planned years
of aLIGO operation, while we should expect to detect
∼ 2 × 104 events with fpbh = 1, we will expect at least
one event if fpbh > 0.04.

Distinguishing whether any individual GW event, or
even some population of events, are from PBH DM or
more traditional astrophysical sources will be daunting.
Still, there are some prospects. Most apparently, PBH
mergers will be distributed more like small-scale DM ha-
los and are thus less likely to be found in or near luminous
galaxies than BH mergers from more traditional astro-
physical sources. Moreover, PBH mergers are expected
to have no electromagnetic/neutrino counterparts what-
soever. A DM component could conceivably show up in
the BH mass spectrum as an excess of events with BH
masses near 30 M(cid:12) over a more broadly distributed mass
spectrum from astrophysical sources.

Since the binary is formed on a very elongated orbit,
the GW waveforms will tend to indicate some ellipticity,
exhibited by higher frequency harmonics [23]. We have
veriﬁed that the ellipticities become unobservably small
by the time the inspiral enters the LIGO band, but they
may be detectable in future experiments [32].

Another potential source of information is the stochas-
tic GW background. Models for the stochastic back-
ground due to BH mergers usually entail a mass distribu-
tion that extends to smaller BH masses and a redshift dis-
tribution that is somehow related to the star-formation
history. Given microlensing limits, the PBH mass func-
tion cannot extend much below 30 M(cid:12). Moreover, the
PBH merger rate per unit comoving volume is likely
higher for PBHs than for traditional BHs at high red-
shifts. Together, these suggest a stochastic background
for PBHs that has more weight at low frequencies and less

at higher ones than that from traditional BH sources.

The results of this work provide additional motivation
for more sensitive next-generation GW experiments such
as the Einstein Telescope [33], DECIGO [34] and BBO
[35], which will continuously extend the aLIGO frequency
range downwards. These may enable the tests described
above for excesses in the BH mass spectrum, high ellip-
ticity and low-frequency stochastic background that are
required to determine if LIGO has detected dark matter.
