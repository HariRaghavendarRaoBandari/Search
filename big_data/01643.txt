Quantum gravity: the Inverse problem

Ll. Bel∗

March 28, 2016

Abstract

Quantizing the gravitational ﬁeld described by General relativity
being a notorious diﬃcult, unsolved and maybe meaningless problem
I use in this essay a diﬀerent strategy:
I consider a linear theory
in the framework of Special relativity where the potentials are the
components of four linear forms. General relativity and other simi-
lar covariant non linear theories can be formulated in this way. The
theory that I propose is Lorentz invariant, linear, simple, and can be
quantized following similar steps to those that led to quantum elec-
trodynamics.

1 Gravity theory

Field potentials

I use Greek indices and doted Greek indices. Both can be raised or lowered
with the Minkowski metric ηαβ; and indices ρ and ˙ρ can be contracted as
usual:

α, β · · · µ = 0, 1, 2, 3

˙ρ, ˙σ · · · = 0, 1, 2, 3

(1)

Let us consider four linear forms θ ˙ρ

α, functions of xα, named the potentials,

in the framework of Special relativity. The ﬁeld components are:

Field components

F ˙ρ
αβ = ∂αθ ˙ρ

β − ∂βθ ˙ρ

α, Fα = F ˙ρ

αρ

They are invariant under the local gage transformations:

From its deﬁnition it follows that:

θ ˙ρ
α 7→ θ ˙ρ

α + ∂αζ ˙ρ

∂αF ˙ρ

βγ + ∂βF ˙ρ

γα + ∂γF ˙ρ

αβ = 0

(2)

Lagrangian

Following the steps of Maxwell theory the Lagrangian I am interested in

is:

L = −

4

F ˙ρ
αβF ˙σ

λµηαληβµηρσ +

1
2

F ˙ρ
α ˙ρF ˙σ

λ ˙σηαλ

(5)

this particular choice being justiﬁed later.

This Lagrangian is globally Lorentz invariant, and locally gage invariant.

The ﬁeld equations derived from it are:

jβ
˙ρ being the four conserved currents one wishes to consider as sources, and

Gβ

˙ρ = jβ

˙ρ

(6)

Gβ

˙ρ = ∂αF αβ

˙ρ − ∂αF αδβ

ρ + ∂ρF β, Fα = F ˙ρ

αρ

is a conserved tensor:

Metric of space-temps

∂βGβ

˙ρ ≡ 0

(7)

(8)

The tetrad formalism of General relativity starts also with four linear
α but instead of considering the ﬁeld variables (2) it uses them to

forms θ ˙ρ
introduce the 4-dimensional Riemannian hyperbolic metric:

gαβ = η ˙ρ ˙σθ ˙ρ

αθ ˙σ

β

(9)

2

and uses as ﬁeld equations the highly non linear Einstein’s equations, that
beautiful and successful as they are at the macroscopic level, they are stub-
bornly resisting quantization.

This metric is locally Lorentz covariant:

α = L ˙ρ′
θ ˙ρ′

˙σ θb

α ⇒ g′

αβ = gαβ

(10)

locally meaning that the matrix elements L ˙ρ′
˙σ could be functions of xα. But
it is not gage invariant. So that to each solution of the ﬁeld equations (6)
will correspond a functional family of metrics gαβ(xα, S ˙ρ)

On the other hand the Weitzenb¨ock formalism starts with a Riemannian
hyperbolic metric but deﬁnes the potentials by a diagonal decomposition (9)
and uses as main concept that of torsion instead of that of curvature, [1]-[8].

Let us assume that:

and:

α = δ ˙ρ
θ ˙ρ

α +

1
2

ˆf ˙ρ
α,

ˆf ˙ρ
α = O(1)

ηαρ ˆf ˙ρ

β − ηβρ ˆf ˙ρ

α = 0

(11)

(12)

where ˆf ˙ρ
corresponding metric will be:

α are small quantities so that its powers can be neglected. The

where:

gαβ = ηαβ + hαβ,

hαβ =

1
2

(ηαρ

ˆf ˙ρ
β + ηβρ

ˆf ˙ρ
α)

(13)

(14)

that with a gage transformation (3) will become:

gαβ = ηαβ + hαβ +

1
2

(∂αζβ + ∂βζα),

ζα = ηα ˙σζ ˙σ
α

(15)

A straightforward calculation shows that:

Sαβ = −

1
2

Gαβ

(16)

where Gαβ is the tensor deﬁned in (7) and Sαβ is the Einstein tensor of the
linear metric (13):

3

Sαβ = Rαβ −

1
2

Rηαβ

(17)

where:

Rαλ = −

1
2

ηβµ(∂αλhβµ + ∂βµhαλ − ∂αµhβλ − ∂βλhαµ)

(18)

Therefore a linear new theory based on the Lagrangian (5) is equivalent
to Einstein’s theory when both are considered at the linear approximation.

2 Free Graviton waves

A graviton wave is by deﬁnition a solution of the vacuum ﬁeld equations:

with:

Gαβ = 0

θ ˙ρ
α = f ˙ρ

α exp(i lσxσ),

lσlσ = 0

(19)

(20)

the propagation vector lσ being a null vector and the polarization tensor f ˙ρ
α
a constant tensor that by a gage transformation (3) where:

becomes:

ζ ˙ρ = λ ˙ρ exp(i lσxσ)

f ˙ρ
α → f ˙ρ

α + lαλ ˙ρ

The gage invariant ﬁeld components are thus:

F ˙ρ
αβ = i(f ˙ρ

β lα − f ˙ρ

αlβ) exp(i lσxσ),

and:

Fα = i(f lα − f ˙ρ

αlρ) exp(ilσxσ),

f = f ˙ρ
ρ

The vacuum ﬁeld equations are thus:

− lαf ˙ρ

αlβ + (lαf ˙σ

α lσ)δρ

β + lρ(f lβ − f ˙σ

β lσ) = 0

The contraction of the two indices β and ˙ρ yields:

lαf ˙ρ

αlρ = 0

4

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

and therefore (25) becomes:

− lαf ˙ρ

αlβ + f lβlρ − lρf ˙σ

β lσ = 0

Introducing the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of fαβ = ηρβf ˙ρ
α:

f −
αβ =

1
2

(fαβ − fβα),

f +
αβ =

1
2

(fαβ + fβα)

so that:

and deﬁning:

fαβ = f +

αβ + f −

αβ

the above equation (27) becomes:

ρ ≡ lαf −
v−
αρ,

ρ ≡ lαf +
v+

αρ

− (v+

β lρ + v+
−(v−

ρ lβ) + f lβlρ +
β lρ − v−

ρ lβ) = 0

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)
(32)

The ﬁrst row is symmetric in β and ρ and the second row is antisymmetric
and therefore the equation is equivalent to the two equations system:

− (v+

β lρ + v+

ρ lβ) + f lβlρ = 0
−(vβlρ − vρlβ) = 0

from where it follows that

lαf −

αρ = a−lρ,

lαf +

αρ =

1
2

f lρ,

f = f ˙ρ
ρ

Using (29) leads the two conditions above to the more convenient form:

lαfαρ = b1lρ,

lαfρα = b2lρ,

with:

b1 is gage invariant, but b2 is not.

b1 + b2 = f ;

(33)
(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

Let uα be a time-like unit vector, to be named a gage-ﬁxing vector. With

a gage transformation (22) we get:

5

uαfαβ → uαfαβ + (uαlα)ζβ

(38)

and therefore, since the coeﬃcient of ζβ is diﬀerent of zero,it is always possible
to implement the condition:

Doing that implies that a gage invariant translation of (36) is:

uαfαβ = 0

f ˙ρ
αβlα = b1 l ˙ρlβ,

f ˙ρ
αβlρ = 0

(39)

(40)

3 Helicities

Let ~e0 be any time-like, gage-ﬁxing unit vector; ~e1 a unit-vector on the 2-
plane Π deﬁned by ~e0 and ~l, and complete an orthogonal frame with two unit
orthogonal vectors ~ea (a=2,3) on the 2-plane orthogonal to Π.

Using the conditions (40), and the above deﬁned reference frame, the

strict matrix components of fαβ are:

f00

−f00 − b1

f20
f30

−f00

f02

f03
f00 + b1 −f02 −f03
f23
f33

f22
f32

f20
f30

With this simpliﬁcation the preceding matrix becomes:

0
−b1
f20
f30

0
b1
f20
f30

0
0
f22
f32

0
0
f23
f33

Now two cases might be considered. If we assume that the matrix fαβ is

symmetric then the matrix becomes:

0
0
0
0

0
0
0
0

0
0
0
0
f+
f×
f× −f+

This corresponds to an helicity 2 of the graviton.

6

If we assume that the matrix fαβ is antisymmetric then the matrix be-

comes:

0
0
0
0

0
0
0
0
0
0
0 − ¯f

0
0
¯f

that corresponds to an helicity 0.

I recover thus the algebraic structure of the graviton concept we are famil-
iar with from the framework of General relativity at the linear approximation,
([9]), ([10])

4 Canonical energy-momentum tensor

The canonical energy-momentum tensor:

γ = ∂γθ ˙ρ
tα

δ

∂L
∂(∂αθ ˙ρ
δ )

− Lδα
γ

(41)

corresponding to the Lagrangian (5) can be easily calculated using the fol-
lowing convenient form of the derivatives of L :

∂L
∂(∂αθ ˙ρ
β)

= −

1
2

∂λθ ˙σ
µ(

( ηαληβµ − ηβληαµ)ηρσ

(42)

− ( ηαλδβ

σ)) (43)

ρ − ηβλδα

ρ )δµ

σ + (ηαµδβ

ρ − ηβµδα

ρ )δλ

The preceding result, with the corresponding expression of the Lagrangian
(5) and the use of (40) proves, after a simple calculation, that for a graviton
ﬁeld the Canonical energy-momentum tensor is:

tα
γ = −

1
2

(f ˙ρ

β f ˙σ

µ ηβµηρσ + 2b1b2) exp(2 i lρxρ)lαlγ

(44)

that can be simpliﬁed with a gage transformation that makes b2 = 0.

5 Quantum gravity Lagrangian

This essay is a proposal to reverse the problem of Quantum gravity: instead
of accepting that General relativity is a theory that applies both at the
macroscopic level and the microscopic one, I suggest that we should keep

7

General relativity to deal with macroscopic problems only and try to ﬁnd
a new theory to deal with microscopic ones, with the condition that at the
linear approximation both theories coincide.

Given four linear forms θ ˙ρ

α there are two equivalent descriptions of the
geometrical frame of General relativity. The best known and almost uni-
versally used is based on the concept of Riemann curvature, while a second
one, little used, is based on the concept of Weitzenb¨ock torsion [2]-[6]. The
formula (16) above proves this equivalence at the ﬁrst approximation. The
unrestricted equivalence is discussed in [6].

To be more speciﬁc: I propose to discuss the quantum interaction of a
spin-1/2 wave function ψ with a Poincar´e invariant theory of the gravitational
ﬁeld F ˙ρ

αβ based on the Lagrangian:

L = −

1
4

F ˙ρ
αβF ˙σ

λµηαληβµη ˙ρ ˙σ+

1
2

F ˙ρ

α ˙ρF ˙σ

λ ˙σηαλ+i ¯Ψγµ∂µΨ−m ¯ΨΨ−pρ ¯ΨγµΨθ ˙ρ

µ (45)

where pρ are the components of the 4-momentum of the interacting fermion
with mass m so that:

The equations of motion that follow are:

ηρσqρqσ = −m2

∂αF αβ

˙ρ − ∂αF αδβ

ρ + ∂ρF β = qρ ¯ΨγβΨ,
iγµ∂µΨ − mΨ = qργµΨθ ˙ρ
µ

They are invariant under local gage transformations:

α → θ ˙ρ
θ ˙ρ

α + ∂αζ ˙ρ, ψ → exp(−iqσζ ˙σ)ψ

and global Lorentz transformations.

Quantization can now proceed as usual introducing the operators:

ˆf +
αρ(xβ, pµ) = Xσ=±2

Z

d3l
q2|~l|

(

a(~l, pµ, σ)eαρ(~l, pµ, σ) exp(i lβxβ)

+ a†(~l, pµ, σ)e∗

αρ(~l, pµ, σ) exp(−i lβxβ))

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

where to describe the interaction of a fermion with a graviton with helicity

2:

8

eαρ,+2(~l, pµ, +2) = e2αe2ρ − e3αe3ρ
eαρ(~l, pµ, −2) = e2αe3ρ + e3αe2ρ

(50)

(51)

where e2α and e3α are any two unit complex vectors orthogonal to lα and pα.

The formulas corresponding to helicity 0 are:

d3l
q2|~l|

αρ(xβ, pµ) = Z
ˆf −

where:

(

a(~l, pµ)eαρ(~l, pµ) exp(i lβxβ)

+ a†(~l, pµ)e∗

αρ(~l, pµ) exp(−i lβxβ))

eαρ(~l, pµ) = e2αe3ρ − e3αe2ρ

(52)

(53)

Notice that considering the creation, a, and annihilation ,a†, amplitudes
of a graviton as explicit functions of the 4-momentum pµ of the Dirac particle
that is the real vector ”charge” of the gravitational ﬁeld makes of (??) and
(??) truly tensor deﬁnitions. (compare with [9] and Kiefer)

This dependence should be reminded also when writing the corresponding

non zero commutators:

[a(~l, pµ, σ), a†(~l′, pµ, σ′)] = δσσ′ δ(~l − ~l′),

or:

[a(~l, pµ), a†(~l′, pµ)] = δ(~l − ~l′),

(54)

(55)

depending on the case.

General relativity is formulated in terms of a curved 4-dimensional ge-
ometry, using the concepts of curvature or torsion depending on taste [1]-[8].
But another conceptual ingredient in the theory is that schematized observers
are part of the theory and this make sense only at the macroscopic level.

In my opinion Quantum gravity could be based on Eqs. (47) that does
not depend on Riemann curvature, or Weitzenb¨ock torsion of space-time.
This can be accepted at the microscopic level, where the main concepts are
those of gravitons mediating the gravitational interactions of Dirac particles,
and observers are no more part of the theory. Observers are only preparing
experiments and observing results as they always have done when dealing
with photons and Dirac particles.
