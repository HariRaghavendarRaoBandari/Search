Abstract

Betweenness centrality is a widely-used measure in the analysis of large complex networks.
It measures the potential or power of a vertex to control the communication over the network
under the assumption that information primarily ﬂows over the shortest paths between them.
In this paper we prove several results on betweenness centrality of Cartesian product of graphs.

Keywords: Betweenness centrality, Pairwise dependency, Cartesian product, Geodetic graph

Introduction

Several Centrality measures have so far been studied and their importance is increasing day by day.
Betweenness centrality has a vital role in the analysis of networks.[1, 2, 3, 4] It has many applica-
tions in a variety of domains such as biological networks [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], study of sexual networks
and AIDS[10], identifying key actors in terrorist networks[11], transportation networks[12], supply
chain management[13], bio-informatics-protein interaction networks[14, 15], food webs [16]etc. Be-
tweennes centrality [17, 18] indicates the betweenness of a vertex (or an edge) in a network and it
measures the extent to which a vertex (or an edge) lies on the shortest paths between pairs of other
vertices. It is quite diﬃcult to ﬁnd out the betweenness centrality of a vertex in a large graph. The
computation of this index based on direct application of deﬁnition becomes impractical as the num-
ber of nodes n increases and has complexity in the order of O(n3). The fastest exact algorithm due
to Brandes[19] requires O(n + m) space and O(nm) time where n is the number of nodes and m the
number of edges in the graph. Exact computations of betweenness centrality can take a lot of time
even for Brandes algorithm. But a large network can be thought of as it is made by joining smaller
networks together. There are several graph operations which results in a larger graph G and many
of the properties of larger graphs can be derived from its constituent graphs. Graph operations
are used for constructing new classes of graphs. Cartesian product is an important graph operation.

It is assumed that the graphs taken here are simple undirected connected graphs. Graph-

reference may be given for making the context clear.

2 Background

The concept of betweenness centrality of a vertex was ﬁrst introduced by Bavelas in 1948 [20]. The
importance of the concept of vertex centrality is that how a vertex acts as a bridge among all the

1

pairs of vertices in joining them by shortest paths. It gives the potential of a vertex for control
of information ﬂow in the network[21, 22]. The order of a graph G is the number of vertices in
G; it is denoted by |G|. The same notation is used for the number of elements (cardinality) of a
set. Thus, |G| = |V (G)|. The distance between two vertices u, v ∈ V (G), denoted by dG(u, v), is
the length of the shortest path in G between u and v. A shortest path joining vertices u and v
is called a geodesic between u and v. A graph G is a geodetic graph[23] if every pair of vertices
of G is connected by a unique shortest path. The diameter, diam(G), of a graph G is given by
max{d(u, v)|u, v ∈ V (G)}. Two vertices u and v of G with d(u, v) = diam(G) are diametrical
vertices[24]. The interval IG(u, v) consists of all vertices on geodesics joining u and v in G.

A graph G is vertex-transitive if every vertex in G can be mapped to any other vertex by some
automorphism. Similarly a graph is edge-transitive if its automorphism group acts transitively on
the set of edges.

A deﬁnition to betweenness centrality of a vertex in a graph G, given by Freeman [25] is as

follows

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Betweenness Centrality). If x ∈ V (G), the betweenness centrality B(x) for x is
deﬁned as

B(x) = Xu6=v6=x

δ(u, v|x)

provided δ(u, v|x) =

σ(u, v|x)
σ(u, v)

where σ(u, v) is the number of shortest u-v paths and σ(u, v|x) is the

number of shortest u-v paths containing x. The ratio δ(u, v|x) is called the pair-dependancy of the
pair of vertices {u, v} on x.

Observe that x ∈ V (G) lies on the shortest path between two vertices u, v ∈ V (G) , iﬀ d(u, v) =

d(u, x) + d(x, v). The number of shortest u-v paths passing through x is given by

σ(u, v|x) = σ(u, x) × σ(x, v)

(1)

Deﬁnition 2.2 (Cartesian Product, [26]). The Cartesian product of two graphs G and H, denoted
by G(cid:3)H, is a graph with vertex set V (G) × V (H), where two vertices (g, h) and (g′, h′) are adjacent
if g = g′ and hh′ ∈ E(H), or gg′ ∈ E(G) and h = h′. The graphs G and H are called factors of
the product G(cid:3)H.

For any h ∈ V (H), the subgraph of G(cid:3)H induced by V (G)× {h} is called as G-ﬁber or G-layer,
denoted by Gh . Similarly, we can deﬁne H-ﬁber or H-layer. They are isomorphic to G and H,
respectively. G(cid:3)H contains |H| copies of G and |G| copies of H. Projections are the maps from
a product graph to its factors. They are weak homomorphisms in the sense that they respect
adjacency. The two projections on G(cid:3)H namely pG : G(cid:3)H → G and pH : G(cid:3)H → H deﬁned
by pG(g, h) = g and pH(g, h) = h refer to the corresponding G-, H- coordinates. Thus an edge in
G(cid:3)H is mapped into a single vertex by one of the projections pG or pH and into an edge by the
other. If G and H are connected, then G(cid:3)H is also connected. Assuming isomorphic graphs are
equal, Cartesian product is commutative as well as associative.

For a graph G and v ∈ V (G), the degree of a vertex v is denoted by dG(v), or simply d(v). Fur-
thermore, we denote by δ(G) the minimum degree of a graph G. The minimum degree is additive
under Cartesian products, i.e. δ(G(cid:3)H) = δ(G) + δ(H). Recall that the symbol NG(v) denotes the
set of neighbours of a vertex v in a graph G. Thus dG(v) = |NG(v)|.

Deﬁnition 2.3 (Cartesian product of several graphs,[27]). The Cartesian product G = G1(cid:3)G2(cid:3) . . . (cid:3)Gk
of the graphs G1, G2, . . . , Gk is deﬁned on the k-tuples (v1, v2, . . . , vk), where vi ∈ Gi, 1 ≤ i ≤ k
in such a way that two k-tuples (u1, u2, . . . , uk) and (v1, v2, . . . , vk) are adjacent if there exists an
index l such that [ul, vl] ∈ E(Gl) and ui = vi for i 6= l. The k-tuples (v1, v2, . . . , vk) are called
coordinate vectors, and the vi are the coordinates.

The Cartesian product G = G1(cid:3)G2(cid:3) . . . (cid:3)Gk of k-factors is brieﬂy denoted as G = (cid:3)k

i=1Gi.
The nth Cartesian product of a graph G is donoted as Gn = (cid:3)n
i=1G. It is to be noted that the
product G is connected if and only if each of its factor Gi is connected and the diameter of the

product is given by, diam((cid:3)k

i=1Gi) =

k

Xi=1

diam(Gi).

The following proposition shows that the distance between two vertices in the product graph is

the sum of the distance between their projections in the factor graphs.

Lemma 2.1. [28] If (g, h) and (g′, h′) are vertices of a Cartesian product G(cid:3)H, then

This can be generalized to the following lemma.

dG(cid:3)H(cid:2)(g, h), (g′, h′)(cid:3) = dG(g, g′) + dH (h, h′)

(2)

Lemma 2.2 (Distance lemma). [28] Let G be the Cartesian product G = (cid:3)k
graphs, and let g = (g1, . . . , gk) and g′ = (g′

k) be vertices of G. Then

1, . . . , g′

i=1Gi of connected

dG(g, g′) =

Xi=1

dGi(gi, g′
i)

Lemma 2.1 implies that dG(cid:3)H(cid:2)(g, h), (g′, h)(cid:3) = dGh(g, h), (g′, h). In other words, dG(cid:3)H restricted

to Gh is dGh.
It means that every shortest path in a G-ﬁber ia also a shortest path in G(cid:3)H.
Subgraphs with this property are called isometric. That is, a subgraph U of a graph G is isometric
in G if dU (u, v) = dG(u, v) for all u, v ∈ G.
It can be easily seen that G-ﬁbers (H-ﬁbers) are
isometric subgraphs of G(cid:3)H. Every shortest G(cid:3)H-path between two vertices of one and the same
ﬁber Gh or H g is already in that ﬁber. Such subgraphs are called convex. A subgraph U of a graph
G is convex in G if every shortest G-path between vertices of U is already in U .

Lemma 2.3. [27] Let G and H be connected graphs. Then all G-ﬁbers and H-ﬁbers are convex
subgraphs of G(cid:3)H.

For a connected graph G and u, v ∈ G, the interval IG(u, v) between u and v is deﬁned as the

set of vertices that lie on shortest u-v paths; that is,

IG(u, v) = {w ∈ G : d(u, v) = d(u, w) + d(w, v)}

Proposition 2.1. [27] Let v1 = (g1, h1) and v2 = (g2, h2) be two vertices of G(cid:3)H, then the vertex
v3 = (g3, h3) lies in IG(cid:3)H(v1, v2) if and only if g3 ∈ IG(g1, g2) and h3 ∈ IH(h1, h2).

It can be generalized as follows.

2.1 The betweenness centrality of vertices in Cartesian product of two graphs

The following proposition shows how the number of geodesics between two vertices u and v in a
product graph G(cid:3)H is related to the the number of geodesics between their projections in the
factor graphs.

Proposition 2.3. If u = (g, h) and v = (g′, h′) are vertices of G(cid:3)H, then the number of shortest
paths, σG(cid:3)H, between them in G(cid:3)H is given by

σG(cid:3)H(cid:2)(g, h), (g′, h′)(cid:3) = σG(g, g′) × σH(h, h′) ×(cid:18)dG(g, g′) + dH (h, h′)
(cid:19)

dG(g, g′)

(3)

Proof. Consider the vertices u = (g, h) and v = (g′, h′) in G(cid:3)H. Let d = d(u, v) denote the
distance between u and v in G(cid:3)H. Suppose there exists unique shortest paths between g, g′ and
h, h′. Every shortest path from u to v is a sequence of d edges and the image of each edge is an
edge lying between g and g′ or h and h′ under the projections pG and pH. Let a sequence of d edges
in the u-v path in the product makes a sequence of dG edges in G and a sequence of dH edges in
H so that d = dG + dH . Since dG and dH are the same for any u-v path, the number of shortest

paths between u and v is the number of ways of selecting dG edges from d edges, which is (cid:18) d
dG(cid:19).
If there exists σG shortest paths between g and g′ in G and σH shortest paths between h and h′ in
H, then corresponding to each pair there exists (cid:18) d
dG(cid:19) shortest paths between u and v in G(cid:3)H.
Therefore, σG(cid:3)H(cid:2)(g, h), (g′, h′)(cid:3) = σG(g, g′) × σH(h, h′) ×(cid:18)dG(g, g′) + dH(h, h′)
For brevity, we may write σ = σG × σH ×(cid:18) d
dG(cid:19)

dG(g, g′)

(cid:19)

Corollary 2.1. If G and H are geodetic graphs, then the number of shortest paths between (g, h)
and (g′, h′) in G(cid:3)H is given by

σG(cid:3)H(cid:2)(g, h), (g′, h′)(cid:3) = (cid:18)dG(g, g′) + dH(h, h′)
(cid:19)

dG(g, g′)

By the associativity of (cid:3), equation 3 can be generalized as

Proposition 2.4. Let G = (cid:3)k

i=1Gni. If u = (u1, u2, . . . , uk), v = (v1, v2, . . . , vk) are two vertices

in G such that σGi(u, v) = σi, dGi(ui, vi) = di and d = X di, then

σG(u, v) = σ1σ2 . . . σn(cid:18) d

d1(cid:19)(cid:18)d − d1

d2 (cid:19)(cid:18)d − d1 − d2

d3

(cid:19) . . . 1

Proposition 2.5. Let v1,v2 and v3 are any three vertices in G(cid:3)H. Then

σG(cid:3)H(v1, v2|v3) = σG(cid:3)H(v1, v3) × σG(cid:3)H(v3, v2)

(4)

Theorem 2.1. If u = (g, h), v = (g′, h′) be any distinct vertices in G(cid:3)H then the betweenness
centrality of x = (g0, h0) in G(cid:3)H is given by

BG(cid:3)H(x) = Xu6=v6=x

δG(cid:3)H (u, v|x)

3 Wiener index of a graph

The Wiener index [29] of a graph G, denoted by W (G) is the sum of the distances between all
(unordered) pairs of vertices of G. That is,

or,

W (G) = Xi<j

W (G) =

d(u, v)

Wiener index is also named total status or total distance of a graph. The Wiener index of Cartesian
product [30, 31, 32] of two graphs G and H is given by

It can be extended to

W (G(cid:3)H) = |G|2W (H) + |H|2W (G)

3.0.1 Grid graphs

Grid graphs are the cartesian product of path graphs. Pm(cid:3)Pn represents a rectangular grid R.
If u = (g, h) and v = (g′, h′) are any two vertices of R, then d(u, v) = |g − g′| + |h − h′| and
σ(u, v) = (cid:18) d

d1(cid:19) where d1 = |g − g′| or |h − h′|.

Figure 3.1: Rectangular grid Pm(cid:3)Pn

Consider the rectangular grid Pm(cid:3)Pn. Let x denotes the vertex (a, b) ∈ Pm(cid:3)Pn where
1 ≤ a ≤ m, 1 ≤ b ≤ n. Consider the paths a(cid:3)Pn and b(cid:3)Pm passing through (a, b). They
divide the rectangular grid into 4 parts namely A, B, C, D sharing their common sides. Figure3.1.
Now the pairs of vertices in the diagonal regions A, B and C, D contribute to the betweenness
centrality of (a, b). Hence

3.1 Hamming graphs

(cid:3)Kn2

If G is a Hamming graph, then
Hamming graphs are Cartesian products of complete graphs.
G = Kn1
(cid:3) . . . (cid:3)Knr for some r ≥ 1 and ni ≥ 2. The vertices of G can be labeled with vector
(a1, a2, . . . ar) where ai ∈ {0, 1, . . . , ni − 1}. Two vertices of G are adjacent if the corresponding
tuples diﬀer in precisely one coordinate. The distance (named Hamming distance) between two
vertices u and v denoted by d(u, v) is the number of positions in which the two vectors diﬀer.

Hypercubes are Cartesian product of complete graphs K2. An r-dimensional hypercube (or r-
cube) denoted by Qr is given by, Qr = (cid:3)r
i=1K2. It can also be deﬁned recursively, Qr = K2(cid:3)Qr−1.
Hypercubes are important classes of graphs having many interesting structural properties. The
number of geodesics between u, v ∈ Qr is given by σ(u, v) = d(u, v)!. For a connected graph G,

6

the condition “I(u, v) induces a d(u, v)-dimensional hypercube for any two vertices u and v of G
implies that G ” is a Hamming graph [24].

Lemma 3.1. [33] A graph G is a nontrivial subgraph of the Cartesisn product of graphs if and only
if G is a nontrivial subgraph of the Cartesian product of two complete graphs.

Proposition 3.1. Let G be the Hamming graph G = Kn1

4 Conclusion

A composite graph can be constructed by applying diﬀerent graph oparations on smaller graphs and
hence many of the structural properties of the composite graphs can be studied from its constituent
smaller subgraphs. Here we tried to ﬁnd the betweenness centrality of Cartesian product of graphs.
This can be extended to other products also.
