Abstract

In this thesis, following F. Brown’s point of view, we look at the Hopf algebra structure
of motivic cyclotomic multiple zeta values, which are motivic periods of the fundamen-
tal groupoid of P1(cid:31){0, µN ,∞}. By application of a surjective period map (which, under
Grothendieck’s period conjecture, is an isomorphism), we deduce results (such as generating
families, identities, etc.) on cyclotomic multiple zeta values, which are complex numbers.
The coaction of this Hopf algebra (explicitly given by a combinatorial formula from A. Gon-
charov and F. Brown’s works) is the dual of the action of a so-called motivic Galois group
on these speciﬁc motivic periods. This entire study was actually motivated by the hope
of a Galois theory for periods, which should extend the usual Galois theory for algebraic
numbers.

In the ﬁrst part, we focus on the case of motivic multiple zeta values (N = 1) and Euler
sums (N = 2). In particular, we present new bases for motivic multiple zeta values: one via
motivic Euler sums, and another (depending on an analytic conjecture) which is known in
the literature as the Hoﬀman (cid:63) basis; under a general motivic identity that we conjecture,
these bases are identical.
In the second part, we apply some Galois descents ideas to the study of these periods,
and examine how periods of the fundamental groupoid of P1(cid:31){0, µN(cid:48),∞} are embedded
into periods of π1(P1(cid:31){0, µN ,∞}), when N(cid:48) | N. After giving some general criteria for
any N, we focus on the cases N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8, for which the motivic fundamental group
N ] (unramiﬁed if N = 6). For those
generates the category of mixed Tate motives on ON [ 1
N, we are able to construct Galois descents explicitly, and extend P. Deligne’s results.

Key words: Periods, Polylogarithms, multiple zeta values, Mixed Tate Motives, cyclotomic
ﬁeld, Hopf algebra, Motivic fundamental group, Galois Descent.

Résumé.

A travers ce manuscrit, en s’inspirant du point de vue adopté par F. Brown, nous examinons
la structure d’algèbre de Hopf des multizêtas motiviques cyclotomiques, qui sont des périodes
motiviques du groupoïde fondamental de P1(cid:31){0, µN ,∞}. Par application d’un morphisme
période surjectif (isomorphisme sous la conjecture de Grothendieck), nous pouvons déduire
des résultats (tels des familles génératrices, des identités, etc.) sur ces nombres complexes
que sont les multizêtas cyclotomiques. La coaction de cette algèbre de Hopf (explicite par une
formule combinatoire due aux travaux de A.B. Goncharov et F. Brown) est duale à l’action
d’un dénommé groupe de Galois motivique sur ces périodes motiviques. Ces recherches sont
ainsi motivées par l’espoir d’une théorie de Galois pour les périodes, étendant la théorie de
Galois usuelle pour les nombres algébriques.

Dans un premier temps, nous nous concentrons sur les multizêtas (N = 1) et les sommes
d’Euler (N = 2) motiviques. En particulier, de nouvelles bases pour les multizetas mo-
tiviques sont présentées: une via les sommes d’Euler motiviques, et une seconde (sous une
conjecture analytique) qui est connue sous le nom de Hoﬀman (cid:63); soulignons que sous une
identité motivique générale que nous conjecturons également, ces bases sont identiques.

Dans un second temps, nous appliquons des idées de descentes galoisiennes à l’étude
de ces périodes, en regardant notamment comment les périodes du groupoïde fondamental
de P1(cid:31){0, µN(cid:48),∞} se plongent dans les périodes de π1(P1(cid:31){0, µN ,∞}), lorsque N(cid:48) | N.
Après avoir fourni des critères généraux (quel que soit N), nous nous tournons vers les cas
N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8, pour lesquels le groupoïde fondamental motivique engendre la catégorie
N ] (non ramiﬁé si N = 6). Pour ces valeurs, nous sommes
des motifs de Tate mixtes sur ON [ 1
en mesure d’expliciter les descentes galoisiennes, et d’étendre les résultats de P. Deligne.

Mots clés: Périodes, Polylogarithmes, multizêtas, corps cyclotomiques, Motifs de Tate

1.1 Motivation

1.1.1 Periods
A period I denotes a complex number that can be expressed as an integral of an algebraic
function over an algebraic domain.II They form the algebra of periods P, fundamental class
of numbers between algebraic numbers Q and complex numbers.
The study of these integrals is behind a large part of algebraic geometry, and its connection
with number theory, notably via L-functions III; and many of the constants which arise in
mathematics, transcendental number theory or in physics turn out to be periods, which
motivates the study of these particular numbers.

Examples:

· The following numbers are periods:
π =(cid:90)x2+y2≤1

√2 =(cid:90)2x2≤1

dx ,

dxdy

and

, z > 1, z ∈ Q.

· Famous -alleged transcendental- numbers which conjecturally are not periods:

e = lim

n→∞(cid:18)1 +

1

n(cid:19)n

,

It can be more useful to consider the ring of extended periods, by inverting π:

1

dx
x

log(z) =(cid:90) z
k(cid:33) or

1

n(cid:88)k=1

.

γ = lim

n→∞(cid:32)−ln(n) +
(cid:98)P := P(cid:20) 1
π(cid:21) .

IFor an enlightening survey, see the reference article [59].
IIWe can equivalently restrict to integral of rational functions over a domain in Rn given by polynomial inequal-
ities with rational coeﬃcients, by introducing more variables.
IIIOne can associate a L− function to many arithmetic objects such as a number ﬁeld, a modular form, an elliptic
curve, or a Galois representation. It encodes its properties, and has wonderful (often conjectural) meromorphic
continuation, functional equations, special values, and non-trivial zeros (Riemann hypothesis).

7

· Multiple polylogarithms at algebraic arguments (in particular cyclotomic multiple zeta
values), by their representation as iterated integral given below, are periods. Similarly,
special values of Dedekind zeta function ζF (s) of a number ﬁeld, of L-functions, of
hypergeometric series, modular forms, etc. are (conjecturally at least) periods or
extended periods.
· Periods also appear as Feynman integrals: Feynman amplitudes I(D) can be written
as a product of Gamma functions and meromorphic functions whose coeﬃcients of
its Laurent series expansion at any integer D are periods (cf.
[7]), where D is the
dimension of spacetime.

Although most periods are transcendental, they are constructible; hence, the algebra P is
countable, and any period contains only a ﬁnite amount of information. Conjecturally (by
Grothendieck’s conjecture), the only relations between periods comes from the following
rules of elementary integral calculusI:

(i) Additivity (of the integrand and of the integration domain)

(ii) Invertible changes of variables

(iii) Stokes’s formula.

Another way of viewing a period (cid:82)γ ω is via a comparison between two cohomology
theories: the algebraic De Rham cohomology, and the singular (Betti) cohomology. More
precisely, let X a smooth algebraic variety deﬁned over Q and Y a closed subvariety over Q.
· On the one hand, the algebraic De Rham cohomology H•dR(X) is the hypercohomology
of the sheaf of algebraic (Kähler) diﬀerentials on X. If X is aﬃne, it is deﬁned from the
de Rham complex Ω•(X) which is the cochain complex of global algebraic (Kähler)
diﬀerential forms on X, with the exterior derivative as diﬀerential. Recall that the
classical kth de Rham cohomology group is the quotient of smooth closed k-forms on
the manifold X(cid:30)C modulo the exact k-forms on X.
Given ω a closed algebraic n-form on X whose restriction on Y is zero, it deﬁnes an
dR(X, Y ), which
equivalence class [ω] in the relative de Rham cohomology groups H n
are ﬁnite-dimensional Q− vector space.
• (X) is the homology of the chain complex
· On the other hand, the Betti homology H B
induced by the boundary operation of singular chains on the manifold X(C); Betti
n (X, Y )∨ are the dual Q vector spaces (taking here
cohomology groups H n
coeﬃcients in Q, not Z).
Given γ a singular n chain on X(C) with boundary in Y (C), it deﬁnes an equivalence
class [γ] in the relative Betti homology groups H B

B(X, Y ) = H B

n (X, Y ) = H n

B(X, Y )∨.II

Furthermore, there is a comparison isomorphism between relative de Rham and relative
Betti cohomology (due to Grothendieck, coming from the integration of algebraic diﬀerential
forms on singular chains):

compB,dR : H•dR(X, Y ) ⊗Q C → H•B(X, Y ) ⊗Q C.

IHowever, ﬁnding an algorithm to determine if a real number is a period, or if two periods are equal seems
currently out of reach; whereas checking if a number is algebraic, or if two algebraic numbers are equal is rather
“easy” (with “LLL”-type reduction algorithm, resp. by calculating the g.c.d of two vanishing polynomials associated
to each).

IIRelative homology can be calculated using the following long exact sequence:

· · · → Hn(Y ) → Hn(X) → Hn(X, Y ) → Hn−1(Y ) → · · · .

8

By pairing a basis of Betti homology to a basis of de Rham cohomology, we obtain the matrix
of periods, which is a square matrix with entries in P and determinant in √Q∗(2iπ)
N∗; i.e.
its inverse matrix has its coeﬃcients in (cid:98)P. Then, up to the choice of these two basis:

The period(cid:82)γ ω is the coeﬃcient of this pairing (cid:104)[γ], compB,dR([ω])(cid:105).

Since (cid:82)γ0

x = 2iπ, 2iπ is a period; as we will see below, it is a period of the Lefschetz

Viewing periods from this cohomological point of view naturally leads to the deﬁnition
of motivic periods given below I, which form an algebra P m, equipped with a period
homomorphism:

per : P m → P.

A variant of Grothendieck’s conjecture, which is a presently inaccessible conjecture in tran-
scendental number theory, predicts that it is an isomorphism.
There is an action of a so-called motivic Galois group G on these motivic periods as we will
see below in §2.1. If Grothendieck’s period conjecture holds, this would hence extend the
usual Galois theory for algebraic numbers to periods (cf. [2]).

In this thesis, we will focus on motivic (cyclotomic) multiple zeta values, deﬁned in §2.3,
which are motivic periods of the motivic (cyclotomic) fundamental group, deﬁned in §2.2.
Their images under this period morphism are the (cyclotomic) multiple zeta values; these
are fascinating examples of periods, which are introduced in the next section (see also [3]).

1.1.2 Multiple zeta values

The Zeta function is known at least since Euler, and ﬁnds itself nowadays, in its various gen-
eralized forms (multiple zeta values, Polylogarithms, Dedekind zeta function, L-functions,
etc), at the crossroad of many diﬀerent ﬁelds as algebraic geometry (with periods and mo-
tives), number theory (notably with modular forms), topology, perturbative quantum ﬁeld
theory (with Feynman diagrams, cf.
[60]), string theory, etc. Zeta values at even integers
are known since Euler to be rational multiples of even powers of π:
Lemma.

For n ≥ 1,

ζ(2n) = | B2n | (2π)2n

2(2n)!

, where B2n is the 2nth Bernoulli number.

However, the zeta values at odd integers already turn out to be quite interesting periods:

Conjecture. π, ζ(3), ζ(5), ζ(7),··· are algebraically independent.

IThe deﬁnition of a motivic period is given in §2.4 in the context of a category of Mixed Tate Motives. In
general, one can do with Hodge theory to deﬁne P m, which is not strictly speaking motivic, once we specify that
the mixed Hodge structures considered come from the cohomology of algebraic varieties.

9

This conjecture raises diﬃcult transcendental questions, rather out of reach; currently
we only know ζ(3) /∈ Q (Apéry), inﬁnitely many odd zeta values are irrational (Rivoal), or
other quite partial results (Zudilin, Rivoal, etc.); recently, F. Brown paved the way for a
pursuit of these results, in [23].

Multiple zeta values relative to the N th roots of unity µN, which we shall denote
by MZVµN are deﬁned by: I

ζ(cid:18) n1, . . . , np
1, . . . , p(cid:19) := (cid:88)0<k1<k2···<kp

p

1 ··· kp
k1
1 ··· knp
kn1

p

, i ∈ µN, ni ∈ N∗, (np, p) (cid:54)= (1, 1). (1.1)

The weight, often denoted w below, is deﬁned as(cid:80) ni, the depth is the length p, whereas
the height, usually denoted h, is the number of ni greater than 1. The weight is conjecturally
a grading, whereas the depth is only a ﬁltration. Denote also by Z N the Q-vector space
spanned by these multiple zeta values relative to µN.
These MZVµN satisfy both shuﬄe  relation (coming from the integral representation be-
low) and stuﬄe ∗ relation (coming from this sum expression), which turns Z N into an
algebra. These relations, for N = 1, are conjectured to generate all the relations between
MZV if we add the so-called Hoﬀman (regularized double shuﬄe) relation; cf.
[25], [77]
for a good introduction to this aspect. However, the literature is full of other relations
among these (cyclotomic) multiple zeta values: cf. [4], [38], [72], [68], [70], [85], [86]. Among
these, we shall require the so-called pentagon resp. hexagon relations (for N = 1, cf. [39]),
coming from the geometry of moduli space of genus 0 curves with 5 ordered marked points
X = M0,5 resp. with 4 marked points X = M0,4 = P1(cid:31){0, 1,∞} and corresponding to a
contractible path in X; hexagon relation (cf. Figure 4.1) is turned into an octagon relation
(cf. Figure 4.2) for N > 1 (cf. [38]) and is used below in §4.2.

One crucial point about multiple zeta values, is their integral representationII, which
makes them clearly periods in the sense of Kontsevich-Zagier. Let us deﬁne ﬁrst the following
iterated integrals and diﬀerential forms, with ai ∈ {0, µN}:
I(0; a1, . . . , an; 1) :=(cid:90)0<t1<···<tn<1
In this setting, with ηi := (i . . . p)−1 ∈ µN, ni ∈ N∗III:

· Multiple zeta values can be seen as special values of generalized multiple polyloga-
rithms, when i are considered in CI. First, notice that in weight 2, Li1(z) := ζ(cid:0) 1
z(cid:1)
is the logarithm − log(1 − z). Already the dilogarithm, in weight 2, Li2(z) := ζ(cid:0) 2
z(cid:1) =
(cid:80)k>0

zk
k2 , satisﬁes nice functional equationsII and arises in many places such as in the
Dedekind zeta value ζF (2) for F an imaginary quadratic ﬁeld, in the Borel regulator in
algebraic K-theory, in the volume of hyperbolic manifolds, etc.; cf. [40]; some of these
connections can be generalized to higher weights.
· Recall that an iterated integral of closed (real or complex) diﬀerential 1−forms ωi along
a path γ on a 1-dimensional (real or complex) diﬀerential manifold M is homotopy
invariant, cf. [27]. If M = C(cid:31){a1, . . . , aN} III and ωi are meromorphic closed 1−forms,
with at most simple poles in ai, and γ(0) = a1, the iterated integral I =(cid:82)γ ω1 ··· ωn is
divergent. The divergence being polynomial in log  ( (cid:28) 1) IV, we deﬁne the iterated
integral I as the constant term, which only depends on γ(cid:48)(0). This process is called
regularization, we need to choose the tangential base points to properly deﬁne the
integral. Later, we will consider the straight path dch from 0 to 1, with tangential
base point −→1 at 0 and −→−1 at 1, denoted also −→1 0,−→−11 or simply −→01 for both.

Notations: In the case of multiple zeta values (i.e. N = 1) resp. of Euler sums (i.e. N = 2),
since i ∈ {±1}, the notation is simpliﬁed, using zi ∈ Z∗:
1, . . . , p(cid:19) with (cid:18) ni

ζ (z1, . . . , zp) := ζ(cid:18) n1, . . . , np

i(cid:19) :=(cid:18) | zi |

sign(zi)(cid:19) .

(1.4)

Another common notation in the literature is the use of overlines instead of negative argu-

ments, i.e.: zi :=(cid:26) ni

ni

if i = 1
if i = −1

.

1.2 Contents

In this thesis, we mainly consider the motivic versions of these multiple zeta values, denoted
ζm(·) and shortened MMZVµN and deﬁned in §2.3. They span a Q-vector space HN of
motivic multiple zetas relative to µN. There is a surjective homomorphism, called the
period map, which is conjectured to be an isomorphism (this is a special case of the period
conjecture):

ζ m(·) (cid:55)→ ζ(·).

per : w : HN → Z N ,

(1.5)
Working on the motivic side, besides being conjecturally identical to the complex num-
bers side, turns out to be somehow simpler, since motivic theory provides a Hopf Algebra
structure as we will see throughout this thesis. Notably, each identity between motivic
MZVµN implies an identity for their periods; a motivic basis for MMZVµN is hence a
generating family (conjecturally basis) for MZVµN.
Indeed, on the side of motivic multiple zeta values, there is an action of a motivic Galois
group GV, which, passing to the dual, factorizes through a coaction ∆ as we will see in

introduction.

Bloch Wigner function D(z) := Im (Li2(z) + log(| z |) log(1 − z)):

§2.4. This coaction, which is given by an explicit combinatorial formula (Theorem (2.4.2),
[Goncharov, Brown]), is the keystone of this PhD. In particular, it enables us to prove linear
independence of MMZV, as in the theorem stated below (instead of adding yet another
identity to the existing zoo of relations between MZV), and to study Galois descents. From
this, we deduce results about numbers by applying the period map.

This thesis is structured as follows:
Chapter 2 sketches the background necessary to understand this work, from Mixed Tate
Motives to the Hopf algebra of motivic multiple zeta values at µN, with some speciﬁ-
cations according the values of N, and results used throughout the rest of this work.
The combinatorial expression of the coaction (or of the weight graded derivation oper-
ators Dr extracted from it, (2.45)) is the cornerstone of this work. We shall also bear
in mind Theorem 2.4.4 stating which elements are in the kernel of these derivations),
which sometimes allows to lift identities from MZV to motivic MZV, up to rational
coeﬃcients, as we will see throughout this work.
Nota Bene: A motivic relation is indeed stronger; it may hence require several rela-
tions between MZV in order to lift an identity to motivic MZV. An example of such a
behaviour occurs with some Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements, in Lemma 4.4.3.

Chapter 3 explains the main results of this PhD, ending with a wider perspective and

possible future paths.

Chapter 4 focuses on the cases N = 1, i.e. multiple zeta values and N = 2, i.e. Euler

sums, providing some new bases:
(i) First, we introduce Euler (cid:93) sums, variants of Euler sums, deﬁned in §2.3 as in
(1.3), replacing each ω±1 by ω±(cid:93) := 2ω±1 − ω0, except for the ﬁrst one and prove:
Theorem. Motivic Euler (cid:93) sums with only positive odd and negative even integers
as arguments are unramiﬁed: i.e. motivic multiple zeta values.

By application of the period map above:
Corollary. Each Euler (cid:93) sums with only positive odd and negative even integers
as arguments is unramiﬁed, i.e. Q linear combination of multiple zeta values.
Moreover, we can extract a basis from this family:
Theorem. {ζ (cid:93),m (2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3, . . . , 2ap−1 + 3,−(2ap + 2)) , ai ≥ 0} is a graded
basis of the space of motivic multiple zeta values.

By application of the period map:
Corollary. Each multiple zeta value is a Q linear combination of elements of the
same weight in {ζ (cid:93) (2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3, . . . , 2ap−1 + 3,−(2ap + 2)) , ai ≥ 0}.

(ii) We also prove the following, where Euler (cid:63) sums are deﬁned (cf. §2.3) as in (1.3),
replacing each ω±1 by ω±(cid:63) := ω±1 − ω0, except the ﬁrst:
Theorem. If the analytic conjecture (4.4.4) holds, then the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63)
family {ζ (cid:63),m({2, 3}×)} is a basis of H1, the space of MMZV.

(iii) Conjecturally, the two previous basis, namely the Hoﬀman (cid:63) family and the Euler(cid:93)
family, are the same. Indeed, we conjecture a generalized motivic Linebarger-Zhao
equality (Conjecture 4.5.1) which expresses each motivic multiple zeta (cid:63) value as
a motivic Euler (cid:93) sum. It extends the Two One formula [Ohno-Zudilin], the Three
One Formula [Zagier], and Linebarger Zhao formula, and applies to motivic MZV.
If this conjecture holds, then (i) implies that the Hoﬀman(cid:63) family is a basis.

12

Such results on linear independence of a family of motivic MZV are proved recursively,
once we have found the appropriate level ﬁltration on the elements; ideally, the family
considered is stable under the derivations I; the ﬁltration, as we will see below, should
correspond to the motivic depth deﬁned in §2.4.3, and decrease under the derivations
II; if the derivations, modulo some spaces, act as a deconcatenation on these elements,
linear independence follows naturally from this recursion. Nevertheless, to start this
procedure, we need an analytic identityIII, which is left here as a conjecture in the
case of the Hoﬀman (cid:63) basis. This conjecture is of an entirely diﬀerent nature from the
techniques developed in this thesis. We expect that it could be proved using analytic
methods along the lines of [82], [63].

Chapter 5 applies ideas of Galois descents on the motivic side. Originally, the notion of
Galois descent was inspired by the question: which linear combinations of Euler sums
are unramiﬁed, i.e. multiple zeta values?IV More generally, looking at the motivic side,
one can ask which linear combinations of MMZVµN lie in MMZVµN(cid:48) for N(cid:48) dividing
N. This is what we call descent (the ﬁrst level of a descent) and can be answered by
exploiting the motivic Galois group action. General descent criteria are given; in the
particular case of N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8V, Galois descents are made explicit and our results
lead to new bases of MMZV relative to µN(cid:48) in terms of a basis of MMZV relative to
µN, and in particular, a new proof of P. Deligne’s results [31].
Going further, we deﬁne ramiﬁcation spaces which constitute a tower of intermediate
spaces between the elements in MMZVµN and the whole space of MMZVµN(cid:48) . This is
summed up in §3.2 and studied in detail Chapter 5 or article [42].
Moreover, as we will see below, these methods enable us to construct the motivic
periods of categories of mixed Tate motives which cannot be reached by standard
methods: i.e. are not simply generated by a motivic fundamental group.

Chapter 6 gathers some applications of the coaction, from maximal depth terms, to mo-
tivic identities, via unramiﬁed motivic Euler sums; other potential applications of these
Galois ideas to the study of these periods are still waiting to be further investigated.

Consistency:
Chapter 2 is fundamental to understand the tools and the proofs of both Chapter 4, 5 and
6 (which are independent between them), but could be skimmed through before the reading
of the main results in Chapter 3. The proofs of Chapter 4 are based on the results of Annexe
A.1, but could be read independently.

IIf the family is not a priori stable under the coaction, we need to incorporate in the recursion an hypothesis

on the coeﬃcients which appear when we express the right side with the elements of the family.

IIIn the case of Hoﬀman basis ([20]), or Hoﬀman (cid:63) basis (Theorem 4.4.1) it is the number of 3, whereas in the
case of Euler (cid:93) sums basis (Theorems 4.3.2), it is the depth minus one; for the Deligne basis given in Chapter 5 for
N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8, it is the usual depth. The ﬁltration by the level has to be stable under the coaction, and more
precisely, the derivations Dr decrease the level on the elements of the conjectured basis, which allows a recursion.

IIIWhere F. Brown in [20], for the Hoﬀman basis, used the analytic identity proved by Zagier in [82], or [63].
IVThis was already a established question, studied by Broadhurst (which uses the terminology honorary) among

others. Notice that this issue surfaces also for motivic Euler sums in some results in Chapter 3 and 5.

VNota Bene: N = ‘6’ is a special case; the quotation marks indicate here that we restrict to unramiﬁed MMZV

cf. §2.1.1.

Background

2.1 Motives and Periods

Here we sketch the motivic background where the motivic iterated integrals (and hence this
work) mainly take place; although most of it can be taken as a black box. Nevertheless,
some of the results coming from this rich theory are fundamental to our proofs.

2.1.1 Mixed Tate Motives
Motives in a nutshell. Motives are supposed to play the role of a universal (and algebraic)
cohomology theory (see [1]). This hope is partly nourished by the fact that, between all the
classical cohomology theories (de Rham, Betti, l-adique, crystalline), we have comparison
isomorphisms in characteristic 0 I. More precisely, the hope is that there should exist a
h−→
tannakian (in particular abelian, tensor) category of motives M(k), and a functor Vark
M(k) such that:
H−→ Veck, there exists a realization map wH such that the
For each Weil cohomologyII: Vark
following commutes:

∀H
VecK

∃wH

where h satisfy properties such as h(X × Y ) = h(X) ⊕ h(Y ), h(X(cid:96) Y ) = h(X) ⊗ h(Y ).

The realizations functors are conjectured to be full and faithful (conjecture of periods of
Grothendieck, Hodge conjecture, Tate conjecture, etc.)III.
To this end, Voedvosky (cf.
DM eﬀ(k)Q, with rational coeﬃcients, equipped with tensor product and a functor:

[76]) constructed a triangulated category of Mixed Motives

Mgm : Sch(cid:30)k → DM eﬀ satisfying some properties such as:

Kunneth Mgm(X × Y ) = Mgm(X) ⊗ Mgm(Y ).
A1-invariance Mgm(X × A1) = Mgm(X).

IEven in positive characteristic, dim H i(X) does not depend on the cohomology chosen among these.
IIThis functor should verify some properties, such as Kunneth formula, Poincare duality, etc. as the classic

cohomology theories.
If we restrict to smooth projective varieties, SmProjk, we can construct such a category, the category of pure
motives Mpure(k) starting from the category of correspondence of degree 0. For more details, cf. [57].
IIIIn the case of Mixed Tate Motives over number ﬁelds as seen below, Goncharov proved it for Hodge and
l-adique Tate realizations, from results of Borel and Soule.

We would like to extract from the triangulated category DM eﬀ(k)Q an abelian category of
Mixed Motives over kII. However, we still are not able to do it in the general case, but it
is possible for some triangulated tensor subcategory of type Tate, generated by Q(n) with
some properties.
Remark: L := Q(−1) = H 1(Gm) = H 1(P1(cid:31){0,∞}) which is referred to as the Lef-
schetz motive, is a pure motive, and has period (2iπ). Its dual is the so-called Tate motive
T := Q(1) = L∨. More generally, let us deﬁne Q(−n) := Q(−1)⊗n resp. Q(n) := Q(1)⊗n

category DM(k)Q from DMeﬀ(k)Q by formally “inverting” the Tate motive Q(1), and then
DMT (k)Q as the smallest triangulated full subcategory of DM(k)Q containing Q(n), n ∈ Z
and stable by extension.

MT (k)Q and equipped with a weight ﬁltration Wr indexed by even integers such that

grW
Every object M ∈ MT (k)Q is an iterated extension of Tate motives Q(n), n ∈ Z.
such that (by the works of Voedvodsky, Levine [61], Bloch, Borel (and K-theory), cf.

In particular, the weight deﬁnes a canonical ﬁber functor:

The action of Gm is a grading, and UMT acts trivially on the graded pieces ω(Q(n)).

ization:

De Rham cohomology leads similarly to the functor de Rham realization:

ωBσ : MT (k) → VecQ, M (cid:55)→ Mσ.

ωdR : MT (k) → Veck, M (cid:55)→ MdR , MdR weight graded.

Beware, the de Rham functor ωdR here is not deﬁned over Q but over k and ωdR = ω ⊗Q k,
so the de Rham realization of an object M is MdR = ω(M ) ⊗Q k.
Between all these realizations, we have comparison isomorphisms, such as:

A Mixed Tate motive over a number ﬁeld is uniquely deﬁned by its de Rham real-

ization, a vector space MdR, with an action of the motivic Galois group GMT .
Example: For instance Q(n), as a Tate motive, can be seen as the vector space Q with

the action λ · x := λnx, for λ ∈ Q∗ = Aut(Q) = Gm(Q).
Mixed Tate Motives over OS. Before, let’s recall for k a number ﬁeld and O its ring of
integers, archimedian values of k are associated to an embedding k

σ

(cid:44)−→ C, such that:

| x |:=| σ(x) |∞ , where | · |∞ is the usual absolute value,
and non archimedian values are associated to non-zero prime ideals of OII:

vp : k× → Z,

vp(x) is the integer such that xOp = pvp(x)Op for x ∈ k×.

For S a ﬁnite set of absolute values in k containing all archimedian values, the ring of
S-integers:

OS := {x ∈ k | v(x) ≥ 0 for all valuations v /∈ S} .

Dirichlet unit’s theorem generalizes for O×S , abelian group of type ﬁnite: III

O×S ∼= µ(K) × Z card (S)−1.

Examples:

· Taking S as the set of the archimedian values leads to the usual ring of integers O, and
would lead to the unramiﬁed category of motives MT (O) below.
· For k = Q, p prime, with S = {vp,| · |∞}, we obtain Z(cid:104) 1
p(cid:105). Note that the deﬁnition
vq,| · |∞}, which would lead to the localization
does not allow to choose S = {∪ qprime
(p) := {x ∈ Q | vp(x) ≥ 0}.

Now, let us deﬁne the categories of Mixed Tate Motives which interest us here:

MT (k)(Q(0), Q(1)) ∼= k∗ ⊗ Q:

MT Γ : the tannakian subcategory formed by objects M such that each subquotient E

MT (k)(Q(0), Q(1))IV.

IThe diﬀerent cohomologies should be viewed as interchangeable realizations. Etale chomology, with the action
of the absolute Galois group Gal(Q(cid:30)Q) (cf [3]) is related to the number Np of points of reduction modulo p. For
Mixed Tate Motives (and conjecturally only for those) Np are polynomials modulo p, which is quite restrictive.
IIO is a Dedekind domain, Op a discrete valuation ring whose prime ideals are prime ideals of O which are
included in (p)Op.
III It will be used below, for dimensions, in 2.31. Here, card (S) = r1 + r2 + card (non-archimedian places); as
usual, r1, r2 standing for the number of real resp. complex (and non real, and up to conjugate) embeddings from

Cyclotomic Mixed Tate Motives.
In this thesis, we focus on the cyclotomic case and
consider the following categories, and sub-categories, for kN the N th cyclotomic ﬁeld, ON :=
Z[ξN ] its ring of integers, with ξN a primitive N th root of unity:

MT N,M := MT (cid:0)ON(cid:2) 1

2.1.2 Motivic periods

as (cf. [32], [24], and [22], §2):
P m
M

M(ω, ωB)) = O(PB,ω).

from a motive M ∈ Ind (M), and classes v ∈ ω(M ), σ ∈ ωB(M )∨. It is a function
PB,ω → A1, which, on its rational points, is given by:

PB,ω(Q) → Q ,

α (cid:55)→ (cid:104)α(v), σ(cid:105).

(2.6)

II.e. each prime p dividing N, generates (Z/mZ)∗, for m such as N = pvp (N )m. It could occur only in the
following cases: N = ps, 2ps, 4ps, psqk, with extra conditions in most of these cases such as: 2 is a primitive root
modulo ps etc.

Example: The ﬁrst example is the Lefschetz motivic period: Lm := [H 1(Gm), [ dx
x ], [γ0]]m,
period of the Lefschetz motive L; it can be seen as the motivic (2iπ)m; this notation appears
below.

This construction can be generalized for any pair of ﬁber functors ω1, ω2 leading to:

Motivic periods of type (ω1, ω2), which are in the following algebra of motivic periods:

Remarks:

P ω1,ω2

M := O (Pω1,ω2) = O(cid:0)Isom⊗(ω2, ω1)(cid:1) .

· The groupoid structure (composition) on the isomorphisms of ﬁber functors on M, by
dualizing, leads to a coalgebroid structure on the spaces of motivic periods:

P ω1,ω3
M → P ω1,ω2

M ⊗ P ω2,ω3
M .

· Any structure carried by these ﬁber functors (weight grading on ωdR, complex conju-
gation on ωB, etc.) is transmitted to the corresponding ring of periods.

Examples:

Motivic Galois theory. The ring of motivic periods P m
is a bitorsor under Tannaka groups
M
(GMT ,GB). If Grothendieck conjecture holds, via the period isomorphism, there is therefore
a (left) action of the motivic Galois group GMT on periods.
More precisely, for each period p there would exist:
(i) well deﬁned conjugates: elements in the orbit of GMT (Q).
(ii) an algebraic group over Q, Gp = GMT (cid:30)Stab(p), where Stab(p) is the stabilizer of p;
Examples:

Gp, the Galois group of p, transitively permutes the conjugates.

· For π for instance, the Galois group corresponds to Gm. Conjugates of π are in fact

2.2 Motivic fundamental group

Prounipotent completion. Let Π be the group freely generated by γ0, . . . , γN. The com-

pleted Hopf algebra (cid:98)Π is deﬁned by:

Q[Π](cid:30)I n,

(cid:98)Π := lim←−

where I := (cid:104)γ − 1, γ ∈ Π(cid:105) is the augmentation ideal.

Equipped with the completed coproduct ∆ such that the elements of Π are primitive, it is
isomorphic to the Hopf algebra of non commutative formal series:I

The prounipotent completion of Π is an aﬃne group scheme Πun:

(2.11)
i.e. the set of non-commutative formal series with N + 1 generators which are group-like for
the completed coproduct for which ei are primitive.
It is dual to the shuﬄe  relation between the coeﬃcients of the series SII. Its aﬃne ring
of regular function is the Hopf algebra (ﬁltered, connected) for the shuﬄe product, and
deconcatenation coproduct:

O(Πun) = lim−→(cid:0)Q[Π](cid:30)I n+1(cid:1)∨ ∼= Q(cid:10)e0, . . . , eN(cid:11) .

O(Πm(XN , x, y)) ∈ MT (kN ).

IWell deﬁned inverse since the log converges in (cid:98)Π; exp(ei) are then group-like for ∆. Notice that the Lie

Algebra of the group of group-like elements is formed by the primitive elements and conversely; besides, the
universal enveloping algebra of primitive elements is the whole Hopf algebra.

coeﬃcients of S.

plied to π1(X, x), resp. π1(X, x, y), if assumed free, the fundamental group resp. groupoid
of X with base point x, resp. x, y, rational points of X, an algebraic variety over Q; the
groupoid π1(X, x, y), is a bitorsor formed by the homotopy classes of path from x to y.

From now, let’s turn to the case XN := P1(cid:31){0,∞, µN}. There, the group π1(XN , x) is

freely generated by γ0 and (γη)η∈µN , the loops around 0 resp. η ∈ µN.II
Chen’s theorem implies here that we have a perfect pairing:
C[π1(XN , x, y)](cid:30)I n+1 ⊗ C(cid:104)ω0, (ωη)η∈µN(cid:105)≤n → C.

(2.13)

In order to deﬁne the motivic πun

1 , let us introduce (cf. [45], Theorem 4.1):

Y (n) := ∪iYi, where

Y0 := {x} × X n−1
Yi := X i−1 × ∆ × X n−i−1, ∆ ⊂ X × X the diagonal
Yn := X n−1 × {y}

.

(2.14)

Then, by Beilinson theorem ([45], Theorem 4.1), coming from γ (cid:55)→ [γ(∆n)]:

Hk(X n, Y (n)) ∼=(cid:26) Q[π1(X, x, y)](cid:30)I n+1

By (2.15), O (πun

We denote it O(cid:0)πm

motivic fundamental groupoid, with the composition of path.

Remark: The pairing (2.13) can be thought in terms of a perfect pairing between homol-
ogy and de Rham cohomology, since (Wojtkowiak [80]):

dR(X n, Y (n)) ∼= kN(cid:104)ω0, . . . , ωN(cid:105)≤n.
H n

The construction of the prounipotent completion and then the motivic fundamental groupoid
would still work for the case of tangential base points , cf. [34], §3IV. Let us denote λN the

I “Esquisse d’un programme”[50], by Grothendieck, vaguely suggests to study the action of the absolute Galois
group of the rational numbers Gal(Q(cid:30)Q) on the étale fundamental group πet
1 (Mg,n), where Mg,n is the moduli
space of curves of genus g and n ordered marked points. In the case of M0,4 = P1(cid:31){0, 1, ∞}, Deligne proposed
1 (P1(cid:31){0, 1, ∞}). This motivates also the
to look instead (analogous) at the pro-unipotent fundamental group πun
study of multiple zeta values, which arose as periods of this fundamental group.

IIBeware, since π1(X, x, y) is not a group, we have to pass ﬁrst to the dual in the previous construction:

ularly consider the tangential base points −−→0ξN := (−→1 0,−→−1ξN ), deﬁned as (λ(cid:48)N (0),−λ(cid:48)N (1));
but similarly for each x, y ∈ µN ∪{0,∞}, such that xλy the straight path between x, y in in
P1(C(cid:31){0, µN ,∞}), we associate the tangential base points −→xy := (xλ(cid:48)y(0),−xλ(cid:48)y(1))I. Since
the motivic torsor of path associated to such tangential basepoints depends only on x, y (cf.
[34], §5) we will denote it xΠm
z :
z →x Πm
cf. Figure 2.1 and [34].
In fact, by Goncharov’s theorem, in case of these tangential base points, the motivic torsor
of path corresponding has good reduction outside N and (cf. [34],§4.11):
N(cid:21)(cid:19) .
y(cid:1) ∈ Ind MT ΓN ⊂ Ind MT (cid:18)ON(cid:20) 1

y . This leads to a groupoid structure via xΠm

The case of ordinary base points, lying in Ind MT (k), has no such good reduction.
In summary, from now, we consider, for x, y ∈ µN ∪ {0}II:

O(cid:0)xΠm

(2.17)

The motivic bitorsors of path xΠm

1 (XN ,−→xy) on XN := P1 − {0, µN ,∞} with
tangential basepoints given by −→xy := (λ(cid:48)(0),−λ(cid:48)(1)) where λ is the straight path from
x to y, x (cid:54)= −y.

y := πm

Let us denote xΠy :=x Πω

y its ω, resp. de Rham resp. Betti realizations.

In particular, Chen’s theorem implies that we have an isomorphism:

0ΠB

Therefore, the motivic fundamental group above boils down to:

(i) The aﬃne group schemes xΠB

y , x, y ∈ µN ∪ {0,∞}, with a groupoid structure. The
Betti fundamental groupoid is the pro-unipotent completion of the ordinary topological
fundamental groupoid, i.e. corresponds to πun

1 (X, x, y) above.

(ii) Π(X) = πω

1 (X), the aﬃne group scheme over Q. It does not depend on x, y since the
existence of a canonical de Rham path between x and y implies a canonical isomorphism
Π(X) ∼=x Π(X)y; however, the action of the motivic Galois group G is sensitive to the
tangential base points x, y.

(iii) a canonical comparison isomorphism of schemes over C, compB,ω.

group with two elements corresponding to the action x (cid:55)→ x−1 and the cyclic group µN
acting by x (cid:55)→ ηx. Notice that for N = 1, 2, 4, the group of projective transformations
XN → XN is larger than DiN, because of special symmetries, and detailed in A.3. II
The dihedral group DiN acts then on the motivic fundamental groupoid πm
1 (X, x, y), x, y ∈
{0}∪ µN by permuting the tangential base points (and its action is respected by the motivic

In particular, the Ihara action deﬁned in (2.42) corresponds via this identiﬁcation to the
composition law for these automorphisms, and then can be computed explicitly. Its dual
would be the combinatorial coaction ∆ used through all this work.

(2.27)

Nota Bene: Each identity between motivic cyclotomic multiple zeta values is then true for
cyclotomic multiple zeta values and in particular each result about a basis with motivic
MZV implies the corresponding result about a generating family of MZV by application of
the period map.
Conversely, we can sometimes lift an identity between MZV to an identity between motivic
MZV, via the coaction (as in [20], Theorem 3.3); this is discussed below, and illustrated
throughout this work in diﬀerent examples or counterexamples, as in Lemma 4.4.3. It is
similar in the case of motivic Euler sums (N = 2). We will see (Theorem 2.4.4) that for
other roots of unity there are several rational coeﬃcients which appear at each step (of the
coaction calculus) and prevent us from concluding by identiﬁcation.

(vi) Homothety: ∀α ∈ µN , I m(0; αa1, . . . , αan; αan+1) = I m(0; a1, . . . , an; an+1).

Remark: These relations, for the multiple zeta values relative to µN, and for the iterated
integrals I(a0; a1,··· , an; an+1) (1.3), are obviously all easily checked.
It has been proven that motivic iterated integrals verify stuﬄe ∗ relations, but also pen-
tagon, and hexagon (resp. octagon for N > 1) ones, as iterated integral at µN. In depth 1,
by Deligne and Goncharov, the only relations satisﬁed by the motivic iterated integrals are
distributions and conjugation relations, stated in §2.4.3.
Motivic Euler (cid:63), (cid:93) sums. Here, assume that N = 1 or 2.I In the motivic iterated integrals
above, I m(··· , ai,··· ), ai were in {0,±1}. We can extend by linearity to ai ∈ {±(cid:63),±(cid:93)},
which corresponds to a ω±(cid:63), resp. ω±(cid:93) in the iterated integral, with the diﬀerential forms:

ω±(cid:63) := ω±1 − ω0 =

dt

t(±t − 1)

and ω±(cid:93) := 2ω±1 − ω0 =

(t ± 1)dt
t(t ∓ 1)

.

It means that, by linearity, for A, B sequences in {0,±1,±(cid:63),±(cid:93)}:
I m(A,±(cid:63), B) = I m(A,±1, B)−I m(A, 0, B), and I m(A,±(cid:93), B) = 2I m(A,±1, B)−I m(A, 0, B).

ζ(cid:63),m: Motivic Euler (cid:63) Sums are deﬁned by a similar integral representation as MES (1.3),

with ω±(cid:63) replacing the ω±1, except the ﬁrst one, which stays a ω±1.
Their periods, Euler (cid:63) sums, which are already common in the literature, can be written
as a summation similar than for Euler sums replacing strict inequalities by large ones:
i := sign(ni), ni ∈ Z∗, np (cid:54)= 1.

They are both Q-linear combinations of multiple Euler sums, and appear in Chapter 4, via
new bases for motivic MZV (Hoﬀman (cid:63), or with Euler (cid:93) sums) and in the Conjecture 4.5.1.

Brown [20] for N = 1, by Deligne [31] for the other cases; new proof in Chapter 5), since

the categories MT (cid:48)N, MT (O(cid:2) 1

such as N prime greater than 5, it is not an isomorphism.
Looking at the dimensions dN
Lemma 2.3.1. For N > 2, dN

N(cid:3)) and MT ΓN are equivalent. However, for some other N,

In particular, these dimensions (for HMT ΓN ) are an upper bound for the dimensions of
motivic MZVµN (i.e. of HN), and hence of MZVµN by the period map. In the case N = pr,
p ≥ 5 prime, this upper bound is conjectured to be not reached; for other N however, this
bound is still conjectured to be sharp (cf. §3.4).

2.4 Motivic Hopf algebra

2.4.1 Motivic Lie algebra.
Let g the free graded Lie algebra generated by e0, (eη)η∈µN in degree −1. Then, the com-
pleted Lie algebra g∧ is the Lie algebra of 0Π1(Q) and the universal enveloping algebra U g
is the cocommutative Hopf algebra which is the graded dual of O(0Π1):

(U g)n = (Qe0 ⊕ (⊕η∈µN

Qeη))⊗n = (O(0Π1)∨)n.

(2.38)

The product is the concatenation, and the coproduct is such that e0, eη are primitive.

Considering the motivic version of the Drinfeld associator:

Φm :=(cid:88)w
··· eηp enp−1

Nota Bene: This motivic Drinfeld associator satisﬁes the double shuﬄe relations, and, for
N = 1, the associator equations deﬁned by Drinfeld (pentagon and hexagon), replacing 2πi
by the Lefschetz motivic period Lm; for N > 1, an octagon relation generalizes this hexagon
relation, as we will see in §4.2.2.
Moreover, it deﬁnes a map:

⊕H∨n → U g which induces a map: ⊕ L∨n → U g.

Deﬁne gm, the Lie algebra of motivic elements as the image of ⊕L∨n in U g:I

(2.40)
The Lie algebra gm is equipped with the Ihara bracket given precisely below. Notice that
for the cases N = 1, 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8, gm is non-canonically isomorphic to the free Lie algebra L
deﬁned in (2.33), generated by (σi)(cid:48)s.

⊕ L∨n ∼−→ gm (cid:44)→ U g.

Ihara action. As said above, the group scheme V of automorphisms of xΠy, x, y ∈ {0, µN}
is isomorphic to 0Π1 (2.18), and the group law of automorphisms leads to the Ihara action.
More precisely, for a ∈0 Π1 (cf. [34]):

(2.41)

IIFor N = 1, Broadhurst and Kreimer made a more precise conjecture for dimensions of multiple zeta values

graded by the depth, which transposes to motivic ones:

(cid:88)

dim(grD

d H1

n)sntd =

1 + E(s)t

1 − O(s)t + S(s)t2 − S(s)t4

,

where

E(s) := s2
1−s2
O(s) := s3
1−s2
S(s) :=
(1−s4)(1−s6)

s12

(2.37)

where E(s), resp. O(s), resp. S(s) are the generating series of even resp. odd simple zeta values resp. of the space
of cusp forms for the full modular group P SL2(Z). The coeﬃcient S(s) of t2 can be understood via the relation
between double zetas and cusp forms in [41]; The coeﬃcient S(s) of t4, underlying exceptional generators in depth
4, is now also understood by the recent work of F. Brown [21], who gave an interpretation of this conjecture via
the homology of an explicit Lie algebra.

IIIFor N = 2, the dimensions are Fibonacci numbers.
IThe action of the Galois group UMT turns L into a coalgebra, and hence gm into a Lie algebra.

31

This action is called the Ihara action:

(cid:55)→ a ◦ b := (cid:104)a(cid:105)0(b) · a.
At the Lie algebra level, it deﬁnes the Ihara bracket on Lie(0Π1):

◦ :

0Π1 ×0 Π1 → 0Π1
(a, b)

{a, b} := a ◦ b − b ◦ a.

(2.42)

(2.43)

Nota Bene: The dual point of view leads to a combinatorial coaction ∆c, which is the

keystone of this work.

2.4.2 Coaction
The motivic Galois group GMT N and hence UMT acts on the de Rham realization 0Π1 of
the motivic fundamental groupoid (cf.
[34],§4.12). It is fundamental, since the action of
UMT is compatible with the structure of xΠy (groupoid, µN equivariance and inertia), that
this action factorizes through the Ihara action, using the isomorphism V ∼=0 Π1 (2.18):

UMT ×0 Π1

0Π1 ×0 Π1 ◦

0Π1

∼

0Π1

Since AMT = O(UMT ), this action gives rise by duality to a coaction: ∆MT , compatible
with the grading, represented below. By the previous diagram, the combinatorial coaction
∆c (on words on 0, η ∈ µN), which is explicit (the formula being given below), factorizes
through ∆MT . Remark that ∆MT factorizes through A, since U is the quotient of UMT by
the kernel of its action on 0Π1. By passing to the quotient, it induces a coaction ∆ on H:

The coaction for motivic iterated integrals is given by the following formula, due to A. B.
Goncharov (cf. [44]) for A and extended by F. Brown to H (cf. [20]):
Theorem. The coaction ∆ : H → A ⊗Q H is given by the combinatorial coaction ∆c:
∆cI m(a0; a1,··· an; an+1) =

Example: In the reduced coactionI of ζ m(−1, 3) = I m(0;−1, 1, 0, 0; 1), there are 3 non zero

cuts:

. Hence:

∆(cid:48)(I m(0;−1, 1, 0, 0; 1))
= I a(0;−1; 1)⊗I m(0; 1, 0, 0; 1)+I a(−1; 1; 0)⊗I m(0;−1, 0, 0; 1)+I a(−1; 1, 0, 0; 1)⊗I m(0;−1; 1)
I.e, in terms of motivic Euler sums, using the properties of motivic iterated integrals (§2.3):

∆(cid:48)(ζ m(−1, 3)) = ζ a(−1) ⊗ ζ m(3) − ζ a(−1) ⊗ ζ m(−3) + (ζ a(3) − ζ a(−3)) ⊗ ζ m(−1).

Deﬁne for r ≥ 1, the derivation operators:

Dr : H → Lr ⊗Q H,

(2.44)

composite of ∆(cid:48) = ∆c − 1 ⊗ id with πr ⊗ id, where πr is the projection A → L → Lr.
Nota Bene: It is suﬃcient to consider these weight-graded derivation operators to keep
track of all the information of the coaction.

According to the previous theorem, the action of Dr on I m(a0; a1,··· an; an+1) is:

DrI m(a0; a1,··· , an; an+1) =

(2.45)

I l(ap; ap+1,··· , ap+r; ap+r+1) ⊗ I m(a0; a1,··· , ap, ap+r+1,··· , an; an+1).

n−1(cid:88)p=0

Remarks
· Geometrically, it is equivalent to keep in the previous coaction only the polygons
corresponding to a unique cut of (interior) length r between two elements of the iterated
integral.
· These maps Dr are derivations:

Dr(XY ) = (1 ⊗ X)Dr(Y ) + (1 ⊗ Y )Dr(X).

· This formula is linked with the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by the iterated integral
I(a0;··· ; an+1) when the a(cid:48)is vary (cf. [44])II:

dI(a0;··· ; an+1) =(cid:88) dI(ai−1; ai; ai+1)I(a0;··· ,(cid:98)ai,··· ; an+1).

Example: By the previous example:

D3(ζ m(−1, 3)) = (ζ a(3) − ζ a(−3)) ⊗ ζ m(−1)
D1(ζ m(−1, 3)) = ζ a(−1) ⊗ (ζ m(3) − ζ m(−3))

The inclusion of P1(cid:31){0, µN ,∞} ⊂ P1(cid:31){0,∞} implies the surjection for the de Rham
realizations of fundamental groupoid:

1 (Gm,−→01).
Looking at the dual, it corresponds to the inclusion of:

0Π1 → πdR

(2.46)

(2.47)

F D

O(cid:16)πdR

This leads to the deﬁnition of an increasing depth ﬁltration F D on O(0Π1)I such that:

1 (Gm,−→01)(cid:17) ∼= Q(cid:10)e0(cid:11) (cid:44)−−−→ O (0Π1) ∼= Q(cid:10)e0, (eη)η(cid:11) .
degeη w ≤ p(cid:43)Q

This ﬁltration is preserved by the coaction and thus descends to H (cf. [21]), on which:

p O(0Π1) :=(cid:42) words w in e0, eη, η ∈ µN such that (cid:88)η∈µN

Motivic depth. The motivic depth of an element in HMT N is deﬁned, via the correspon-
dence (2.36), as the degree of the polynomial in the (fi). I It can also be deﬁned recursively

Remarks:
· The terms of type (d, d’), corresponding to a deconcatenation, play a particular role
since modulo some congruences (using depth 1 result for the left side of the coaction),
we will get rid of the other terms in the cases N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8 for the elements in
the basis.
In the dual point of view of Lie algebra, like in Deligne’s article [31] or
Wojtkowiak [79], this corresponds to showing that the Ihara bracket {,} on these
elements modulo some vector space reduces to the usual bracket [, ]. More generally,
for other bases, like Hoﬀman’s one for N = 1, the idea is still to ﬁnd an appropriate
ﬁltration on the conjectural basis, such that the coaction in the graded space acts on
this family, modulo some space, as the deconcatenation, as for the fi alphabet. Indeed,
on H (2.36), the weight graded part of the coaction, Dr is deﬁned by:

Dr : Hn −→ Lr ⊗ Hn−r
f j1
i1 ··· f jk

ik (cid:55)−→(cid:26) f j1

i1 ⊗ f j2
0

i2

. . . f jk
ik

such that :

if i1 = r.
else .

(2.52)

· One fundamental feature for a family of motivic multiple zeta values (which makes it
“natural” and simple) is the stability under the coaction. For instance, if we look at
the following family which appears in Chapter 5:
ζ m(cid:18) n1,··· , np−1, np
1, . . . , p−1, p (cid:19)

with p ∈ µN primitive

and (i)i<p non primitive.

If N is a power of a prime, this family is stable via the coaction. I It is also stable via
the Galois action if we only need to take 1 as a non primitive (1-dimensional case), as
for MT (O6).

ISince in this case, (non primitive) · ( non primitive) = non primitive and non primitive · primitive = primitive
root. Note also, for dimensions reasons, if we are looking for a basis in this form, we should have N −ϕ(N ) ≥ ϕ(N )
,
which comes down here to the case where N is a power of 2 or 3.

2

37

Proof. Straightforward from 2.4.2, using the properties of motivic iterated integrals previ-
ously listed (§2.3). Terms of type (a) correspond to cuts from a 0 (possibly the very ﬁrst
one) to a root of unity, (b) terms from a root of unity to a 0, (c) terms between two roots of
unity and (d,d’) terms are the cuts ending in the last 1, called deconcatenation terms.

Derivation space. By Lemma 2.4.1 (depth 1 results), once we have chosen a basis for
1 Lr, composed by some ζ a(ri; ηi), we can well deﬁne: I

(iii) The derivation set D as the (disjoint) union: D := (cid:116)r>0 {Dr}.

Remarks:
· In the case N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, the cardinal of Dr,p is one (or 0 if r even and N = 2,
or if (r, N ) = (1, 6)), whereas for N = 8 the space generated by these derivations is
2-dimensional, generated by Dξ8
· Following the same procedure for the non-canonical Hopf comodule H deﬁned in (2.36),
isomorphic to HMT N , since the coproduct on H is the deconcatenation (2.52), leads
to the following derivations operators:

fundamental for several linear independence results in §4.3 and Chapter 5:

Kernel of D<n. A key point for the use of these derivations is the ability to prove some
relations (and possibly lift some from MZV to motivic MZV) up to rational coeﬃcients.
This comes from the following theorem, looking at primitive elements:

(resp. motivic Euler sums), amounts to:

for N = 3, 4, ‘6’.

.

In particular, by this result (for N = 1, 2), proving an identity between motivic MZV

1. Prove that the coaction is identical on both sides, computing Dr for r > 0 smaller than
the weight. If the families are not stable under the coaction, this step would require
other identities.

2. Use the corresponding analytic result for MZV (resp. Euler sums) to deduce the
remaining rational coeﬃcient; if the analytic equivalent is unknown, we can at least
evaluate numerically this rational coeﬃcient.

Some examples are given in §6.3 and §4.4.3.
Another important use of this corollary, is the decomposition of (motivic) multiple zeta
values into a conjectured basis, which has been explained by F. Brown in [19].II
However, for greater N, several rational coeﬃcients appear at each step, and we would need
linear independence results before concluding.

IFor N = 1, we restrict to r odd > 1; for N = 2 we restrict to r odd; for N = ‘6’ we restrict to r > 1.
IIHe gave an exact numerical algorithm for this decomposition, where, at each step, a rational coeﬃcient has
to be evaluated; hence, for other roots of unity, the generalization, albeit easily stated, is harder for numerical
experiments.

Results

3.1 Euler (cid:63), (cid:93) sums [Chapter 4]

In Chapter 4, we focus on motivic Euler sums (N = 2), shortened ES, and motivic multiple
zeta values (N = 1), with in particular some new bases for the vector space of MMZV: one
with Euler (cid:93) sums and, under an analytic conjecture, the so-called Hoﬀman (cid:63) family. These
two variants of Euler sums are (cf. Deﬁnition 4.1.1):
Euler (cid:63) sums corresponds to the analogue multiple sums of ES with ≤ instead of strict

inequalities. It veriﬁes:

ζ (cid:63)(n1, . . . , np) = (cid:88)◦=‘+’ or ,

ζ(n1 ◦ ··· ◦ np).

(3.1)

Notation: This ‘ + ’ operation on ni ∈ Z, is a summation of absolute values, while
signs are multiplied.
These have already been studied in many papers: [9], [56], [58], [65], [69], [86].

Euler (cid:93) sums are, similarly, linear combinations of MZV but with 2-power coeﬃcients:

ζ (cid:93)(n1, . . . , np) = (cid:88)◦=‘+’ or ,

2p−n+ζ(n1 ◦ ··· ◦ np),

with n+ the number of + . (3.2)

We also pave the way for a motivic version of a generalization of a Linebarger and Zhao’s
equality (Conjecture 4.5.1) which expresses each motivic multiple zeta (cid:63) as a motivic Euler
(cid:93) sums; under this conjecture, Hoﬀman (cid:63) family is a basis, identical to the one presented
with Euler sums (cid:93).

The ﬁrst (naive) idea, when looking for a basis for the space of multiple zeta values, is
to choose:

{ζ (2n1 + 1, 2n2 + 1, . . . , 2np + 1) (2iπ)2s, ni ∈ N∗, s ∈ N}.

However, considering Broadhurst-Kreimer conjecture (2.37), the depth ﬁltration clearly does
not behave so nicely in the case of MZV I and already in weight 12, they are not linearly
independent:

28ζ(9, 3) + 150ζ(7, 5) + 168ζ(5, 7) =

ζ(12).

5197
691

IRemark, as we will see in Chapter 5, or as we can see in [31] that for N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8, the depth ﬁltration is
dual of the descending central series of U, and, in that sense, does behave well. For instance, the following family
is indeed a basis of motivic Euler sums:

{ζm (2n1 + 1, 2n2 + 1, . . . , 2np−1 + 1, −(2np + 1)) (Lm)2s, ni ∈ N, s ∈ N}.

40

Consequently, in order to ﬁnd a basis of motivic MZV, we have to:

Either: Allow higher depths, as the Hoﬀman basis (proved by F Brown in [20]), or the (cid:63)

analogue version:

Hoffman (cid:63)

: {ζ (cid:63),m (2a0, 3, 2a1 , . . . , 3, 2ap ) , ai ≥ 0} .

The analogous real family Hoﬀman (cid:63) was also conjectured (in [56], Conjecture 1) to be
a basis of the space of MZV. Up to an analytic conjecture (4.4.4), we prove (in §4.4)
that the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63) family is a basis of H1, the space of motivic MZVI. In this
case, the notion of motivic depth (explained in §2.4.3) is the number of 3, and is here
in general much smaller than the depth.

Or: Pass by motivic Euler sums, as the Euler (cid:93) basis given below; it is also another illus-
tration of the descent idea of Chapter 5: roughly, it enables to reach motivic periods
in HN(cid:48) coming from above, i.e. via motivic periods in HN, for N(cid:48) | N.

More precisely, let look at the following motivic Euler (cid:93) sums:
Theorem. The motivic Euler sums ζ (cid:93),m ({even , odd }×) are motivic geometric periods of
MT (Z). Hence, they are Q linear combinations of motivic multiple zeta values.II
Notations: Recall that an overline x corresponds to a negative sign, i.e. −x in the
argument. Here, the family considered is a family of Euler (cid:93) sums with only positive odd
and negative even integers for arguments.
This motivic family is even a generating family of motivic MZV from which we are able to
extract a basis:
Theorem. A basis of P m,+

MT (Z),R = H1, the space of motivic multiple zeta values is:

{ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2(cid:1) , ai ≥ 0}.

The proof is based on the good behaviour of this family with respect to the coaction
and the depth ﬁltration; the suitable ﬁltration corresponding to the motivic depth for this
family is the usual depth minus 1.
By application of the period map, combining these results:
Corollary. Each Euler sum ζ (cid:93) ({even , odd }×) (i.e. with positive odd and negative even
integers for arguments) is a Q linear combination of multiple zeta values of the same weight.
Conversely, each multiple zeta value of depth < d is a Q linear combination of elements
ζ (cid:93)(cid:0)2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2(cid:1), of the same weight with ai ≥ 0, p ≤ d.
Remarks:
· Finding a good basis for the space of motivic multiple zeta values is a fundamental
question. Hoﬀman basis may be unsatisfactory for various reasons, while this basis
with Euler sums (linear combinations with 2 power coeﬃcients) may appear slightly
more natural, in particular since the motivic depth is here the depth minus 1. However,
both of those two baess are not bases of the Z module and the primes appearing in
the determinant of the passage matrix III are growing rather fast.IV

IUp to this analytic statement, 4.4.4, the Hoﬀman (cid:63) family is then a generating family for MZV.
IISince, by [20], we know that Frobenius invariant geometric motivic periods of MT (Z) are Q linear combinations
of motivic multiple zeta values.
IIIThe inverse of the matrix expressing the considered basis in term of a Z basis.
IVDon Zagier has checked this for small weights with high precision; he suggested that the primes involved in
the case of this basis could have some predictable features, such as being divisor of 2n − 1.

· Looking at how periods of MT (Z) embed into periods of MT (Z[ 1
2 ]), is a fragment of
the Galois descent ideas of Chapter 5.
Euler sums which belong to the Q-vector space of multiple zeta values, sometimes
called honorary, have been studied notably by D. Broadhurst (cf. [11]) among others.
We deﬁne then unramiﬁed motivic Euler sums as motivic ES which are Q-linear com-
binations of motivic MZVs, i.e. in H1. Being unramiﬁed for a motivic period implies
that its period is unramiﬁed, i.e. honorary; some examples of unramiﬁed motivic ES
are given in §6.2, or with the family above. In Chapter 5, we give a criterion for motivic
Euler sums to be unramiﬁed 5.1.3, which generalizes for some other roots of unity; by
the period map, this criterion also applies to Euler sums.
· For these two theorems, in order to simplify the coaction, we crucially need a motivic
identity in the coalgebra L, proved in §4.2, coming from the octagon relation pictured
in Figure 4.3. More precisely, we need to consider the linearized version of the anti-
invariant part by the Frobenius at inﬁnity of this relation, in order to prove this hybrid
relation (Theorem 4.2.3), for ni ∈ N∗, i ∈ ±1:
k(cid:18) n0,··· , np
0, . . . , p (cid:19)+ζ l
ζ l
Thanks to this hybrid relation, and the antipodal relations presented in §4.2.1, the
coaction expression is considerably simpliﬁed in Appendix A.1.
Theorem. If the analytic conjecture (4.4.4) holds, then the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63) family
{ζ (cid:63),m({2, 3}×)} is a basis of H1, the space of MMZV.
Nota Bene: A MMZV (cid:63), in the depth graded, is obviously equal to the corresponding
MMZV. However, the motivic Hoﬀman (i.e. with only 2 and 3) multiple zeta ((cid:63)) values are
almost all zero in the depth graded (the motivic depth there being the number of 3). Hence,
the analogous result for the non (cid:63) caseI, proved by F. Brown, does not make the result in
the (cid:63) case anyhow simpler.
Denote by H2,3 the Q-vector space spanned by the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63) family. The idea
of the proof is similar as in the non-star case done by Francis Brown. We deﬁne an increas-
• on H2,3, called the level, such that:II
ing ﬁltration F L
l H2,3 is spanned by ζ (cid:63),m(2a0, 3,··· , 3, 2al ), with less than “l” 3.
F L
l H2,3 is stable under the action of G.

One key feature is that the vector space F L
The linear independence is then proved thanks to a recursion on the level and on the weight,
using the injectivity of a map ∂ where ∂ came out of the level and weight-graded part of the
coaction ∆ (cf. §4.4.1). The injectivity is proved via 2-adic properties of some coeﬃcients
with Conjecture 4.4.4.
One noteworthy diﬀerence is that, when computing the coaction on the motivic MZV(cid:63),
some motivic MZV(cid:63)(cid:63) arise, which are a non convergent analogue of MZV(cid:63) and have to be
renormalized. Therefore, where F. Brown in the non-star case needed an analytic formula
proven by Don Zagier ([82]), we need some slightly more complicated identities (in Lemma
4.4.3) because the elements involved, such as ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),m(2a, 3, 2b) for instance, are not of depth
1 but are linear combinations of products of depth 1 motivic MZV times a power of π.

These two bases for motivic multiple zeta values turn to be identical, when considering
this conjectural motivic identity, more generally:

II.e. that the motivic Hoﬀman family is a basis of the space of MMZV, cf [19].
IIBeware, this notion of level is diﬀerent than the level associated to a descent in Chapter 5. It is similar as the
level notion for the Hoﬀman basis, in F. Brown paper’s [20]. It corresponds to the motivic depth, as we will see
through the proof.

where the sign ± is always − for an even argument, + for an odd one, δc = δc=1, Kronecker

This conjecture expresses each motivic MZV(cid:63) as a linear combination of motivic Euler
sums, which gives another illustration of the Galois descent between the Hopf algebra of
motivic MZV and the Hopf algebra of motivic Euler sums.

(3.3)

Nota Bene: Such a motivic relation between MMZVµN is stronger than its analogue be-
tween MZVµN since it contains more information; it implies many other relations because of
its Galois conjugates. This explain why its is not always simple to lift an identity from MZV
to MMZV from the Theorem 2.4.5. If the family concerned is not stable via the coaction,
such as (iv) in Lemma 4.4.3, we may need other analytic equalities before concluding.

This conjecture implies in particular the following motivic identities, whose analogue for
real Euler sums are proved as indicated in the bracketsI:
Two-One [For ci = 1, Ohno Zudilin: [69]]:

ζ (cid:63),m(2a0, 1,··· , 1, 2ap ) = −ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)2a0, 2a1 + 1, . . . , 2ap−1 + 1, 2ap + 1(cid:1) .

Three-One [For ci alternatively 1 and 3, Zagier conjecture, proved in [9]]

(3.4)

Linebarger-Zhao (cid:63) [With ci ≥ 3, Linebarger Zhao in [65]]:

ζ (cid:63),m(2a0 , 1, 2a1, 3··· , 1, 2ap−1, 3, 2ap ) = −ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)2a0, 2a1 + 2, . . . , 2ap−1 + 2, 2ap + 2(cid:1) .
ζ (cid:63),m (2a0 , c1,··· , cp, 2ap ) = −ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)2a0 + 1, 1c1−3,··· , 1ci−3, 2ai + 3, . . . , 2ap + 2(cid:1)(3.6)
ζ (cid:63),m (2a0 , 3,··· , 3, 2ap ) = −ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3, . . . , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2(cid:1) .

Nota Bene: Hence the previous conjecture (4.36) implies that the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63) is a
basis, since we proved the right side of (4.36) is a basis:

(3.5)

(3.7)

In particular, restricting to all ci = 3:

Conjecture 4.5.1 =⇒ Hoﬀman (cid:63) is a basis of MMZV.

Examples: The previous conjecture would give such relations:

ζ (cid:63),m(2, 2, 3, 3, 2) = −ζ (cid:93),m(5, 3,−4)
ζ (cid:63),m(1, 6) = ζ (cid:93),m(−2, 1, 1, 1,−2)

ζ (cid:63),m(5, 6, 2) = −ζ (cid:93),m(1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1,−4)
ζ (cid:63),m(2, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3) = −ζ (cid:93),m(3, 1,−2,−6,−2).

IBeware, only the identity for real Euler sums is proved; the motivic analogue stays a conjecture.

3.2 Galois Descents [Chapter 5]
There, we study Galois descents for categories of mixed Tate motives MT ΓN , and how
periods of πun
1 (XN ) for N(cid:48) | N. Indeed, for each
N, N(cid:48) with N(cid:48)|N there are the motivic Galois group GMT N acting on HMT N and a Galois
descent between HMT N(cid:48) and HMT N , such that:
(HMT N )GN/N(cid:48)

1 (XN(cid:48)) are embedded into periods of πun

= HMT N(cid:48) .

Since for N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8, the categories MT N and MT (cid:48)N are equal, this Galois descent
has a parallel for the motivic fundamental group side; we will mostly neglect the diﬀerence
in this chapter:

Nota Bene: For N(cid:48) = 1 or 2, iπm has to be replaced by ζ m(2) or (πm)2, since we con-
sider, in HN(cid:48) only periods invariant by the Frobenius F∞. In the descent between HN and
HN(cid:48), we require hence invariance by the Frobenius in order to keep only those periods; this
condition get rid of odd powers of iπm.

The ﬁrst section of Chapter 5 gives an overview for the Galois descents valid for any N:
a criterion for the descent between MMZVµN(cid:48) and MMZVµN (Theorem 5.1.1), a criterion
for being unramiﬁed (Theorem 5.1.2), and their corollaries. The conditions are expressed
in terms of the derivations Dr, since they reﬂect the Galois action. Indeed, looking at the
descent between MT N,M and MT N(cid:48),M(cid:48), sometimes denoted ((cid:100)) = (kN /kN(cid:48), M/M(cid:48)), it has
possibly two components:

· The change of cyclotomic ﬁelds kN /kN(cid:48); there, the criterion has to be formulated in
the depth graded.
· The change of ramiﬁcation M/M(cid:48), which is measured by the 1 graded part of the
coaction i.e. D1 with the notations of §2.4.
The second section speciﬁes the descents for N ∈ {2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8} II represented in Figure
3.3, and 3.4.
In particular, this gives a basis of motivic multiple zeta values relative to
µN(cid:48) via motivic multiple zeta values relative to µN, for these descents considered, N(cid:48) | N.
It also gives a new proof of Deligne’s results ([31]): the category of mixed Tate motives
over OkN [1/N ], for N ∈ {2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8} is spanned by the motivic fundamental groupoid of
P1 \ {0, µN ,∞} with an explicit basis; as claimed in §2.2, we can even restrict to a smaller

IThe (non-canonical) horizontal isomorphisms have to be chosen in a compatible way.

Let us present our results further and ﬁx a descent ((cid:100)) = (kN /kN(cid:48), M/M(cid:48)) among these
considered (in Figures 3.3, 3.4), between the category of mixed Tate motives of ON [1/M ]
and ON(cid:48)[1/M(cid:48)].I Each descent ((cid:100)) is associated to a subset D(cid:100) ⊂ D of derivations, which
represents the action of the Galois group GN/N(cid:48). It deﬁnes, recursively on i, an increasing
motivic ﬁltration F(cid:100)i on HN called motivic level, stable under the action of GMT N :
Motivic level:(cid:40) F(cid:100)
The 0th level F(cid:100)0HN, corresponds to invariants under the group GN/N(cid:48) while the ith level
F(cid:100)i , can be seen as the ith ramiﬁcation space in generalized Galois descents. Indeed, they
correspond to a decreasing ﬁltration of ith ramiﬁcation Galois groups Gi, which are the
subgroups of GN/N(cid:48) which acts trivially on F iHN.II

Those ramiﬁcation spaces constitute a tower of intermediate spaces between the elements

Let deﬁne the quotients associated to the motivic level:

IIOn ramiﬁcation groups in usual Galois theory:

(cid:26) v is the valuation on L

Gi := {g ∈ Gal(L/K) | v(g(α) − α) > i} ,

(3.8)
Equivalently, this condition means g acts trivially on OL(cid:30)pi+1, i.e. g(x) ≡ x (mod pi+1). This decreasing
ﬁltration of normal subgroups corresponds, by the Galois fundamental theorem, to an increasing ﬁltration of
Galois extensions:

This is a useful recursive criterion to determine if a (motivic) Euler sum is in fact a
(motivic) multiple zeta value. It can be generalized for other roots of unity, as we state more
precisely in §5.1. These unramiﬁed motivic Euler sums are the 0th-level of the ﬁltration by
the motivic level here deﬁned as:

FiH2 is the largest sub-module such that Fi/Fi−1 is killed by D1.

Results. More precisely, for N ∈ {2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8}, we deﬁne a particular family BN of motivic
multiple zeta values relative to µN with diﬀerent notions of level on the basis elements, one

unramiﬁed) it is a linear basis analogous to his algebraic basis which is formed by Lyndon words in the odd (resp.
≥ 2) positive integers (with . . . 5 ≤ 3 ≤ 1); a Lyndon word being strictly smaller in lexicographic order than all of
the words formed by permutation of its letters. Deligne’s method is roughly dual to this point of view, working
in Lie algebras, showing the action is faithful and that the descending central series of U is dual to the depth
ﬁltration.

are motivic Euler sums with odds, and at least one 1 in the arguments; i.e. they are of

3.3 Miscellaneous Results [Chapter 6]

Chapter 6 is devoted on the Hopf algebra structure of motivic multiple zeta values relative
to µN, particularly for N = 1, 2, presenting various uses of the coaction, and divided into
sections as follows:

1. An important use of the coaction, is the decomposition of (motivic) multiple zeta values
into a conjectured basis, as explained in [19]. It is noteworthy to point out that the
coaction always enables us to determine the coeﬃcients of the maximal depth terms.

We consider in §6.1 two simple cases, in which the space grD

2. Using criterion 5.1.3, we provide in the second section inﬁnite families of honorary
motivic multiple zeta values up to depth 5, with speciﬁed alternating odd or even
integers. It was inspired by some isolated examples of honorary multiple zeta values
found by D. BroadhurstI, such as ζ(8, 5, 8), ζ(8, 3, 10), ζ(3, 6, 3, 6, 3), where we already
could observe some patterns of even and odd. Investigating this trail in a systematic
way, looking for any general families of unramiﬁed (motivic) Euler sums (without linear
combinations ﬁrst), we arrive at the families presented in §6.2, which unfortunately,
stop in depth 5. However, this investigation does not cover the unramiﬁed Q-linear
combinations of motivic Euler sums, such as those presented in Chapter 4, Theorem
4.3.1 (motivic Euler (cid:93) sums with positive odds and negative even integers).

3. By Corollary 2.4.5, we can lift some identities between MZV to motivic MZV (as in
[20], Theorem 4.4), and similarly in the case of Euler sums. Remark that, as we will see
for depth 1 Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements (Lemma 4.4.3), the lifting may not be straightforward,
if the family is not stable under the coaction. In this section §6.3, we list some identities
that we are able to lift to motivic versions, in particular some Galois trivial elementsII
or product of simple zetas, and sum identities.

Remark: The stability of a family on the coaction is a precious feature that allows to
prove easily (by recursion) properties such as linear independenceIII, Galois descent features
(unramiﬁed for instance), identities (§6.3), etc.

3.4 And Beyond?

N ]) is
For most values of N, the situation concerning the periods of MT ΓN ⊂ MT (ON [ 1
still hazy, although it has been studied in several articles, notably by Goncharov ([45],[46],
[47]IV) and Zhao: some bounds on dimensions, tables in small weight, and other results and
thoughts on cyclotomic MZV can be seen in [85], [84], [29].

Nevertheless, we can a priori split the situation (of MT ΓN ) into two main schemes:

IIGalois trivial here means that the unipotent part of the Galois group acts trivially, not Gm; hence not strictly
IIIIf we ﬁnd an appropriate ﬁltration respected by the coaction, and such as the 0 level elements are Galois-
trivial, it corresponds then to the motivic depth ﬁltration; for the Hoﬀman ((cid:63)) basis it is the number of 3; for the
Euler (cid:93) sums basis, it is the number of odds, also equal to the depth minus 1; for Deligne basis relative to µN ,
N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8, it is the usual depth.
IVGoncharov studied the structure of the fundamental group of Gm(cid:31)µN and made some parallels with the
topology of some modular variety for GLm,(cid:30)Q, m > 1 notably. He also proved, for N = p ≥ 5, that the following
morphism, given by the Ihara bracket, is not injective:

even though no suitable basis has been found. Also, in these cases, Zhao conjectured
there were non standard relationsI. Nevertheless, in the case of N power of 2 or power
of 3, there seems to be a candidate for a basis (3.12) and some linearly independent
families were exhibited:

ζ m(cid:18) n1,··· np−1, np
1, . . . , p−1, p(cid:19)

with p ∈ µN primitive

and (i)i<p non primitive.

(3.12)
Indeed, when N is a power of 2 or 3, linearly independent subfamilies of 3.12, keeping
4 resp. 2
3 generators in degree 1, and all generators in degree r > 1 are presented in
3
[79] (in a dual point of view of the one developed here).

Nota Bene: Some subfamilies of 3.12, restricting to {i = 1, xi ≥ 2} (here p still
as above) can be easily proven (via the coaction, by recursion on depth) to be linearly
independent for any N; if N is a prime power, we can widen to xi ≥ 1, and for N even
to i ∈ {±1}; nevertheless, these families are considerably small.

(ii) For N = ps, p prime greater than 5, there are missing periods: i.e.

For N = p ≥ 5, it can already be seen in weight 2, depth 2. More precisely, (taking
the dual point of view of Goncharov in [46]), the following map is not surjective:
, where (a) := ζ a(cid:18) 1
ξa(cid:19) .
D1 :

ζ a(cid:16) 1,1
ξa,ξb(cid:17) (cid:55)→ (a) ⊗ (b) + δa+b(cid:54)=0((b) − (a)) ⊗ (a + b)

(3.13)
These missing periods were a motivation for instance to introduce Aomoto polyloga-
rithms (in [36])II.
Another idea, in order to reach these missing periods would be to use Galois descents:
coming from a category above, in order to arrive at the category underneath, in the
manner of Chapter 5. For instance, missing periods for N = p prime > 5, could be

transposed in such context.

· It also worth noticing that, for N = p > 5, modular forms obstruct the freeness of the
Lie algebra grDgmII, as in the case of N = 1 (cf.
[21]). Indeed, for N = 1 one can
associate, to each cuspidal form of weight n, a relation between weight n double and
simple multiple zeta values, cf.
[41]. Notice that, on the contrary, for N = 2, 3, 4, 8,
grDgm is free. This fascinating connection with modular forms still waits to be ex-
plored for cyclotomic MZV. III

· In these cases where grDgm is not free, since we have to turn towards other basis (than
n, cf [20]): {ζ m ({2, 3}×)} weight n,
3.12), we may remember the Hoﬀman basis (of H1
whose dimensions verify dn = dn−2 + dn−3. Looking at dimensions in Lemma 2.3.1,
two cases bring to mind a basis in the Hoﬀman’s way:
(i) For MT (ON ), since dn = ϕ(N )
(ii) For MT (cid:16)Opr(cid:104) 1

Example: For N = 2, the recursion relation for dimensions dn = dn−1 + dn−2 of H2

suggests, in the Hoﬀman’s way, a basis composed of motivic Euler sums with only 1
and 2. For instance, the following are candidates conjectured to be a basis, supported
by numerical computations:

(cid:26)ζ m(cid:18) n1, . . . , np−1, np

1, . . . , 1,−1 (cid:19) , ni ∈ {2, 1}(cid:27) , or (cid:26)ζ m(cid:18) 1,··· 1,

s,−1 (cid:19) ζ m(2)•, s ∈ {{1},{−1,−1}}∗(cid:27) .

However, there is not a nice suitable ﬁltrationI corresponding to the motivic depth
which would allow a recursive proof II.

IIn the second case, it appears that we could proceed as follows to show the linear independence of these
elements, where p equals 1+ the number of 1 in the En element: Prove that, for x ∈ En,p there exists a linear
combination cl(x) ∈ En,>p such that x + cl(x) ∈ F D
p Hn, and then that {x + cl(x), x ∈ En,p} is precisely a basis
for grD

p Hn, considering, for 2r ≤ n − p:

D2r+1 : grD

p Hn → grD

p−1Hn−2r−1.

IIA suitable ﬁltration, whose level 0 would be the power of π, level 1 would be linear combinations of ζ(odd)·ζ(2)•,

etc.; as in proofs in §4.5.1.

MZV (cid:63) and Euler (cid:93) sums

Contents: After introducing motivic Euler (cid:63), and (cid:93) sums, with some useful motivic relations
(antipodal and hybrid), the third section focuses on some speciﬁc Euler (cid:93) sums, starting by
a broad subfamily of unramiﬁed elements (i.e. which are motivic MZV) and extracting
from it a new basis for H1. The fourth section deals with the Hoﬀman star family, proving
it is a basis of H1, up to an analytic conjecture (4.4.4). In Appendix §4.7, some missing
coeﬃcients in Lemma 4.4.3, although not needed for the proof of the Hoﬀman (cid:63) Theorem
4.4.1, are discussed. The last section presents a conjectured motivic equality (4.5.1) which
turns each motivic MZV (cid:63) into a motivic Euler (cid:93) sums of the previous honorary family; in
particular, under this conjecture, the two previous bases are identical. The proofs here are
partly based on results of Annexe §A.1, which themselves use relations presented in §4.2.

e∞ as generators, instead of the usual e0, e1, it leads towards MMZV (cid:63)(cid:63) up to a sign,
instead of MMZV since −ω0 + ω1 − ω(cid:63) = 0. We could also choose e1 and e∞ as gen-
erators, which leads to another version of MMZV that has not been much studied yet.
These versions are equivalent since each one can be expressed as Q linear combination
of another one.
· By linearity and -regularisation (2.28), all these versions ((cid:63), (cid:63)(cid:63), (cid:93) or (cid:93)(cid:93)) are Q-linear

4.2 Relations in L
4.2.1 Antipode relation

In this part, we are interested in some Antipodal relations for motivic Euler sums in the
coalgebra L, i.e. modulo products. To explain quickly where they come from, let’s go back
to two combinatorial Hopf algebra structures.

First recall that if A is a graded connected bialgebra, there exists an unique antipode S
(leading to a Hopf algebra structure)II, which is the graded map deﬁned by:

S(x) = −x −(cid:88) S(x(1)) · x(2),

where · is the product and using Sweedler notations for the coaction:

∆(x) = 1 ⊗ x + x ⊗ 1 +(cid:88) x(1) ⊗ x(2) = ∆(cid:48)(x) + 1 ⊗ x + x ⊗ 1.

Hence, in the quotient A/A>0 · A>0:

(4.2)

S(x) ≡ −x.

IThe stuﬄe for these motivic iterated integrals can be deduced from works by Goncharov on mixed Hodge
structures, but was also proved in a direct way by G. Racinet, in his thesis, or I. Souderes in [75] via blow-ups.
Remark that shuﬄe relation, coming from the iterated integral representation is clearly motivic.

IIIt comes from the usual required relation for the antipode in a Hopf algebra, but because it is graded and

connected, we can apply the formula recursively to construct it, in an unique way.

4.2.1.1 The  Hopf algebra

Let X = {a1,··· , an} an alphabet and A := Q(cid:104)X×(cid:105) the Q-vector space generated by
words on X, i.e. non commutative polynomials in ai. It is easy to see that A is a Hopf
algebra with the  shuﬄe product, the deconcatenation coproduct ∆D and antipode S:

∆D(ai1 ··· ain ) =

ai1 ··· aik ⊗ aik+1 ··· ain.

(4.3)

n(cid:88)k=0

(4.4)
A is even a connected graded Hopf algebra, called the shuﬄe Hopf algebra; the grading
coming from the degree of polynomial. By the equivalence of category between Q-Hopf
algebra and Q-Aﬃne Group Scheme, it corresponds to:

S(ai1 ··· ain) = (−1)nain ··· ai1 .

G = SpecA : R → Hom(Q(cid:104)X(cid:105), R) = {S ∈ R(cid:104)(cid:104)ai(cid:105)(cid:105) | ∆S = S(cid:98)⊗S, (S) = 1},

where ∆ is the coproduct dual to the product :

(4.5)

∆(ai1 ··· ain ) = (1 ⊗ ai1 + ai1 ⊗ 1)··· (1 ⊗ ain + ain ⊗ 1) .

Let restrict now to X = {0, µN}; our main interest in this Chapter is N = 2, but it can be
extended to other roots of unity. The shuﬄe relation for motivic iterated integral relative
to µN:

I m(0;·; 1) is a morphism of Hopf algebra from A to (R,×) :
I m(0; w; 1)I m(0; w(cid:48); 1) = I m(0; w  w(cid:48); 1) with w, w(cid:48) words in X.

(4.6)

Lemma 4.2.1 (Antipode ). In the coalgebra L, with w the weight, • standing for
MMZVµN , or (cid:63)(cid:63) (N = 2) resp. (cid:93)(cid:93)-version (N = 2):

ζ•,l

n−1(cid:18) n1, . . . , np

1 , (cid:33) where  := 1 · . . . · p.
This formula stated for any N is slightly simpler in the case N = 1, 2 since ni ∈ Z∗:

1, . . . , p(cid:19) ≡ (−1)w+1ζ•,l

np−1(cid:32) np−1, . . . , n1, n
−1
p−1, . . . , −1

Antipode  :

ζ•,l
n−1 (n1, . . . , np) ≡ (−1)w+1ζ•,l
I l(0; X; ) ≡ (−1)wI l(; (cid:101)X; 0) ≡ (−1)w+1I l(0; (cid:101)X; )

|np|−1 (np−1, . . . , n1, sign(n1 ··· np)n)

.

(4.7)

Here X is any word in 0,±1 or 0,±(cid:63) or 0,±(cid:93), and (cid:101)X denotes the reversed word.

Proof. For motivic iterated integrals, as said above:

which, in terms of the MMZVµN notation is:

S(I m(0; a1, . . . , an; 1)) = (−1)nI m(0; an, . . . , a1; 1),
1, . . . , p(cid:19)(cid:19) ≡ (−1)wζ•,l

1 , (cid:33) where  := 1 · . . . · p.
S(cid:18)ζ•,l
Then, if we look at the antipode recursive formula (4.2) in the coalgebra L, for ai ∈ {0, µN}:

np−1(cid:32) np−1, . . . , n1, n
−1
p−1, . . . , −1

n−1(cid:18) n1, . . . , np

S(I l(0; a1, . . . , an; 1)) ≡ −I l(0; a1, . . . , an; 1).

This leads to the lemma above. The -antipode relation can also be seen at the level of
iterated integrals as the path composition modulo products followed by a reverse of path.

4.2.1.2 The ∗ Hopf algebra
Let Y = {··· , y−n, . . . , y−1, y1,··· , yn,···} an inﬁnite alphabet and A∗ := Q(cid:104)Y ×(cid:105) the non
commutative polynomials in yi with rational coeﬃcients, with y0 = 1 the empty word.
Similarly, it is a graded connected Hopf algebra called the stuﬄe Hopf algebra, with the
stuﬄe ∗ product and the following coproduct:I

∆D∗(yn1 ··· ynp ) =(cid:88) yn1 ··· yni ⊗ yni+1, . . . , ynp , ni ∈ Z∗.
Nota Bene: Remark that here we restricted to Euler sums, N = 2, but it could be extended
for other roots of unity, for which stuﬄe relation has been stated in §4.1.
The completed dual is the Hopf algebra of series Q(cid:104)(cid:104)Y (cid:105)(cid:105) with the coproduct:

(4.8)

∆∗(yn) =

|n|(cid:88)k=0

sgn(n)=1 2

y1k ⊗ y2(n−k).

Now, let introduce the notations:II

where ni ∈ Z∗ and the operation ‘ + ’ indicates that signs are multiplied whereas absolute
values are summed. It is straightforward to check that:

k≥0

,

∆D∗(w(cid:63)) = (∆D∗(w))(cid:63),

and ∆D∗(w(cid:93)) = (∆D∗(w))(cid:93).

(4.9)

As said above, the relation stuﬄe is motivic:

ζ m(·) is a morphism of Hopf algebra from A∗ to (R,×).

Lemma 4.2.2 (Antipode ∗). In the coalgebra L, with ni ∈ Z∗

n−1(n1, . . . , np) ≡ (−1)p+1ζ (cid:63),l

n−1(n1, . . . , np) ≡ (−1)p+1ζ (cid:93),l

n−1(np, . . . , n1).
n−1(np, . . . , n1).

Proof. By recursion, using the formula (4.2), and the following identity (left to the reader):

p−1(cid:88)i=0

we deduce the antipode S∗:

(−1)i(yni ··· yn1 )(cid:63) ∗ (yni+1 ··· ynp ) = −(−1)p(ynp ··· yn1 )(cid:63),

Similarly:

S∗(yn1 ··· ynp ) = (−1)p(ynp ··· yn1 )(cid:63).

S∗((yn1 ··· ynp )(cid:93)) = −

n−1(cid:88)i=0

S∗((yn1 ··· yni)(cid:93)) ∗ (yni+1 ··· ynp )(cid:93)

n−1(cid:88)i=0

Then, we deduce the lemma, since ζ m(·) is a morphism of Hopf algebra. Moreover, the
formula (4.2) in the coalgebra L gives that:

S(ζ l(s)) ≡ −ζ l(s).

4.2.2 Hybrid relation in L
In this part, we look at a new relation called hybrid relation between motivic Euler sums in
the coalgebra L, i.e. modulo products, which comes from the motivic version of the octagon
relation (for N > 1, cf. [38]) I

This relation is motivic, and hence valid for the motivic Drinfeld associator Φm (2.39), re-
placing 2iπ by the Lefschetz motivic period Lm.

Let focus on the case N = 2 and recall that the space of motivic periods of MT (cid:0)Z[ 1

decomposes as (cf. 2.10):

P m
MT (Z[ 1

2 ]) = H2 ⊕ H2.Lm,

where H2 is F∞ invariant

H2.Lm is F∞ anti-invariant .

(4.10)

For the motivic Drinfeld associator, seeing the path in the Riemann sphere, it becomes:

Let X = P1(cid:31){0,±1,∞}. The action of the real Frobenius F∞ on X(C) is induced
by complex conjugation. The real Frobenius acts on the Betti realization πB(X(C))I, and
induces an involution on motivic periods, compatible with the Galois action:

whereas terms corresponding to real paths in Figure 4.3, such as Drinfeld associator terms,

brid relation.

reversed word, we obtain both:

Equivalently, in terms of motivic iterated integrals, for X any word in {0,±1}, with (cid:101)X the

I l(0; 0k, (cid:63), X; 1) ≡ I l(0; X, (cid:63), 0k; 1) ≡ (−1)w+1I l(0; 0k, (cid:63), (cid:101)X; 1),
I l(0; 0k,−(cid:63), X; 1) ≡ I l(0;−X,−(cid:63), 0k; 1) ≡ (−1)w+1I l(0; 0k,−(cid:63),−(cid:101)X; 1)

The proof is given below, ﬁrstly for k = 0, using octagon relation (Figure 4.3). The

generalization for any k > 0 is deduced directly from the shuﬄe regularization (2.28).

k+|np| (np−1, . . . , n1, n0)(cid:17)

Remarks:

· This theorem implies notably the famous depth-drop phenomena when weight and
depth have not the same parity (cf. Corollary 4.2.4).
· Equivalently, this statement is true for X any word in {0,±(cid:63)}. Recall that (2.29), by
linearity:

I m(. . . ,±(cid:63), . . .) := I m(. . . ,±1, . . .) − I m(. . . , 0, . . .).

· The point of view adopted by Francis Brown in [21], and its use of commutative poly-
nomials (also seen in Ecalle work) can be applied in the coalgebra L and leads to a new
proof of Theorem 4.2.3 in the case of MMZV, i.e. N = 1, sketched in Appendix A.4;
it uses the stuﬄe relation and the antipode shuﬄe. Unfortunately, generalization for
motivic Euler sums of this proof is not clear, because of this commutative polynomial
setting.

Similarly:

The ﬁrst line is zero (since e0 + e1 + e−1 + e∞ = 0) whereas each other line will
contribute by two terms, in order to give (4.12). Indeed, the projection πL(x), when
seeing x as a polynomial (with only even powers) in Lm, only keep the constant term;
hence, for each term, only one of the exponentials above ex contributes by its linear
term i.e. x, while the others contribute simply by 1. For instance, if we examine
carefully the second line of (4.14), we get:

(4.14)

= e0Φl(e−1, e0, e∞) + Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)(e−1 + e∞ + e1)

−(−e0)Φl(e−1, e0, e∞) − Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)(−e−1 − e∞ − e1)

= 2(cid:2)e0Φl(e−1, e0, e∞) − Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)e0(cid:3)

.

Similarly, the third line of (4.14) is equal to (e0+e−1)Φl(e∞, e−1, e1)−Φl(e∞, e−1, e1)(e0+
e−1) and the last line is equal to −e1Φl(e1, e∞, e0) + Φl(e1, e∞, e0)e1. Therefore, (4.14)
is equivalent to (4.12), as claimed.

This linearized octagon relation 4.12, while looking at the coeﬃcient of a speciﬁc word in
{e0, e1, e−1}, provides an identity between some ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l(•) and ζ l(•) in the coalgebra L. The
diﬀerent identities obtained in this way are detailed in the §4.6. In the following proof of
Theorem 4.2.3, two of those identities are used.
Proof of Theorem 4.2.3. The identity with MMZVµ2 is equivalent to, in terms of motivic
iterated integrals:III

I l(0; 0k, (cid:63), X; 1) ≡ I l(0; X, (cid:63), 0k; 1) and I l(0; 0k,−(cid:63), X; 1) ≡ I l(0;−X,−(cid:63), 0k; 1).

case k = 0.

(ii) Now, let look at the coeﬃcient of a speciﬁc word in {e0, e1, e−1} beginning by e1, and

ending by e−1. Only two terms in the left side of (4.12) contribute, i.e.:

In terms of iterated integrals, reversing the ﬁrst one with Antipode , it is:

I l (0;−X,−(cid:63); 1) ≡ I l (0;−(cid:63), X; 1) .

Therefore, since X can be any word in {0,±(cid:63)}, by linearity this is also true for any
word X in {0,±1}.

Indeed, these two identities lead to a dihedral group structure of order p + 1: (4.17), respec-
tively Shift, correspond to the action of a reﬂection resp. of a cycle of order p on motivic

Remark: In the coaction of Euler sums, terms with 1 can appearII, which are clearly not
motivic multiple zeta values. The left side corresponding to such a term in the coaction
part D2r+1(·) is I l(1; X;−1), X odd weight with 0,±(cid:93). It is worth underlying that, for the
(cid:93) family with {even, odd}, these terms disappear by Sign, since by constraint on parity,
X will always be of even depth for such a cut. This (cid:93) family is then more suitable for an
unramiﬁed criterion, cf. §4.3.

By the Antipode (cid:63) relation applied to ζ (cid:93),l, it implies the result stated, splitting the
cases w + p even and w + p odd.

Which, reversing the variables, gives the Cut rule.
· Minus follows from Cut since, by Cut both sides are equal to ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
(n1,··· , np−1).
· In Cut, the sign of np does not matter, hence, using Cut in both directions, with
diﬀerent signs leads to Sign:

Note that, translating in terms of iterated integrals, it leads to, for X any sequence of
0,±(cid:93), with w + p odd:

I l(0; X; 1) ≡ I l(0;−X; 1),

where −X is obtained from X after exchanging (cid:93) and −(cid:93). Moreover, I l(0;−X; 1) ≡
I l(0; X;−1) ≡ −I l(−1; X; 0). Hence, we obtain, using the composition rule of iterated
integrals modulo product:

I l(0; X; 1) + I l(−1; X; 0) ≡ I l(−1; X; 1) ≡ 0.

4.3 Euler (cid:93) sums

Let’s consider more precisely the following family, appearing in Conjecture 4.5.1, ith only
positive odd and negative even integers for arguments:

In the iterated integral, this condition means that we see only the following sequences:

ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0){even , odd }×(cid:1) .
02a+1 − ,

with

02a,

or

 ∈ {±(cid:93)}.

Theorem 4.3.1. The motivic Euler sums ζ (cid:93),m({even , odd }×) are motivic geometric+ pe-
riods of MT (Z).
Hence, they are Q linear combinations of motivic multiple zeta values.
The proof, in §4.3.2, relies mainly upon the stability under the coaction of this family.
This motivic family is even a generating family of motivic MZV:
Theorem 4.3.2. The following family is a basis of H1:

B(cid:93) :=(cid:8)ζ (cid:93),m(2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2) , ai ≥ 0(cid:9) .

65

First, it is worth noticing that this subfamily is also stable under the coaction.

Remark: It is conjecturally the same family as the Hoﬀman star family ζ (cid:63)(2a0 , 3,··· , 3, 2ap ),
by Conjecture (4.5.1).

For that purpose, we use the increasing depth ﬁltration F D on H2 such that (cf. §2.4.3):

p H2 is generated by Euler sums of depth smaller than p.

Note that it is not a grading, but we deﬁne the associated graded as the quotient grD

of this (cid:93) family is proved below thanks to a recursion on the depth and on the weight, using
the injectivity of a map ∂ where ∂ came out of the depth and weight-graded part of the
coaction ∆.

To lighten the result, some cases at the borders (i = 0, or i = p) have been included in the
sum, being fundamentally similar (despite some index problems). These are clariﬁed in the
previous footnoteII.
In particular, with notations of the Lemma A.1.1, T0,0 terms can be neglected as they
decrease the depth by at least 2; same for the T0, and T,0 for cuts between  and ±. To
obtain the lemma, it remains to check the coeﬃcient of ζ l(2r + 1) for each term in the left
side thanks to the known identities:

ζ l(2r + 1) = −22r
22r − 1

ζ l(2r + 1)

and

4.3.2 Proofs of Theorem 4.3.1 and 4.3.2
Proof of Theorem 4.3.1. By Corollary 5.1.2, we can prove it in two steps:

· First, checking that D1(·) = 0 for this family, which is rather obvious by Lemma 5.2.8
since there is no sequence of the type {0, ,−} or {,−, 0} in the iterated integral.
· Secondly, we can use a recursion on weight to prove that D2r+1(·), for r > 0, are
unramiﬁed. Consequently, using recursion, this follows from the following statement:

The family ζ (cid:93),m ({even , +odd }×) is stable under D2r+1.

This is proved in Lemma A.1.3, using the relations of §4.2 in order to simplify the
unstable cuts, i.e. the cuts where a sequence of type , 02a+1,  or , 02a,− appears;
indeed, these cuts give rise to a even or to a odd in the (cid:93) Euler sum.

One fundamental observation about this family, used in Lemma A.1.3 is: for a subsequence
of odd length from the iterated integral, because of these patterns of , 02a, , or , 02a+1,−,
we can put in relation the depth p, the weight w and s the number of sign changes among
the ±(cid:93):

w ≡ p − s

(mod 2).

It means that if we have a cut 0,··· p+1 of odd weight, then:

Either: Depth p is odd, s even, 0 = p+1, Or: Depth p is even, s odd, 0 = −p+1.

Proof of Theorem 4.3.2. By a cardinality argument, it is suﬃcient to prove the linear
independence of the family, which is based on the injectivity of ∂<n,p. Let us deﬁne: I

ISub-Q vector space of H1 by previous Theorem.

67

Hodd(cid:93): Q-vector space generated by ζ (cid:93),m(2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2).

The ﬁrst thing to remark is that Hodd(cid:93) is stable under these derivations, by the expression
obtained in Lemma A.1.4.:

n−2r−1,
Now, let consider the restriction on Hodd(cid:93) of ∂<n,p and prove:

n

∂<n,p : grD

p Hodd(cid:93)

n → ⊕2r+1<ngrD

p−1Hodd(cid:93)

n−2r−1 is bijective.

The formula (4.18) gives the explicit expression of this map. Let us prove more precisely:
M D

n,p the matrix of ∂<n,p on(cid:8)ζ (cid:93),m(2a0 + 1, 2a1 + 3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2)(cid:9) in terms of

(cid:8)ζ (cid:93),m(2b0 + 1, 2b1 + 3,··· , 2bp−2 + 3, 2bp−1 + 2)(cid:9) is invertible.

Nota Bene: The matrix M D
n,p is well (uniquely) deﬁned provided that the ζ (cid:93),m of the second
line are linearly independent. So ﬁrst, we have to consider the formal matrix associated MD
n,p
deﬁned explicitly (combinatorially) by the formula for the derivations given, and prove MD
n,p
is invertible. Afterwards, we could state that M D
n,p is well deﬁned and invertible too since
equal to MD
n,p.
Proof. The invertibility comes from the fact that the (strictly) smallest terms 2-adically in
(4.18) are the deconcatenation ones, which is an injective operation. More precisely, let
n,p be the matrix Mn,p where we have multiplied each line corresponding to D2r+1 by
(2−2r). Then, order elements on both sides by lexicographical order on (ap, . . . , a0), resp.
(r, bp−1, . . . , b0), such that the diagonal corresponds to r = ap + 1 and bi = ai for i < p. The
2 -adic valuation of all the terms in (4.18) (once divided by 22r) is at least 1, except for the
deconcatenation terms since:

(cid:102)M D

v2(cid:18)2−2r+1(cid:18) 2r

2ap + 1(cid:19)(cid:19) ≤ 0 ⇐⇒ v2(cid:18)(cid:18) 2r

2ap + 1(cid:19)(cid:19) ≤ 2r − 1.
Then, modulo 2, only the deconcatenation terms remain, so the matrix (cid:102)M D
with 1 on the diagonal. This implies that det((cid:102)M D
zero: the matrix (cid:102)M D

n,p is triangular
n,p) ≡ 1 (mod 2), and in particular is non
n,p is invertible, and so does MD
n,p.

This allows us to complete the proof since it implies:

The elements of B(cid:93) are linearly independent.

Proof. First, let prove the linear independence of this family of the same depth and weight,
by recursion on p. For depth 0, this is obvious since ζ m(2n) is a rational multiple of π2n.
Assuming by recursion on the depth that the elements of weight n and depth p − 1 are
linearly independent, since M D
n,p is invertible, this means both that the ζ (cid:93),m(2a0 + 1, 2a1 +
3,··· , 2ap−1 + 3, 2ap + 2) of weight n are linearly independent and that ∂<n,p is bijective,
as announced before.
The last step is just to realize that the bijectivity of ∂<n,l also implies that elements of
diﬀerent depths are also linearly independent. The proof could be done by contradiction:
by applying ∂<n,p on a linear combination where p is the maximal depth appearing, we
arrive at an equality between same level elements.

4.4 Hoﬀman (cid:63)

Theorem 4.4.1. If the analytic conjecture (4.4.4) holds, then the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63) family
{ζ (cid:63),m({2, 3}×)} is a basis of H1, the space of MMZV.

For that purpose, we deﬁne an increasing ﬁltration F L

• on H2,3, called level, such that:
(4.19)
It corresponds to the motivic depth for this family, as we see through the proof below and
the coaction calculus.

l H2,3 is spanned by ζ (cid:63),m(2a0, 3,··· , 3, 2ap ), with less than ’l’ 3.
F L

Sketch. The vector space F L
l H2,3 is stable under the action of G (4.21). The linear in-
dependence of the Hoﬀman (cid:63) family is proved below (§4.4.2) thanks to a recursion on the
level and on the weight, using the injectivity of a map ∂L where ∂L came out of the level
and weight-graded part of the coaction ∆ (cf. 4.4.2). The injectivity is proved via 2-adic
properties of some coeﬃcients conjectured in 4.4.4.
Indeed, when computing the level graded coaction (cf. Lemma 4.4.2) on the Hoﬀman (cid:63)
elements, looking at the left side, some elements appear, such as ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),m(2a, 3, 2b) but also
ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),m(2a, 3, 2b). These are not always of depth 1 as we could expect,I but at least are
abelians: product of motivic simple zeta values, as proved in Lemma 4.4.3.
To prove the linear independence of Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements, we will then need to know some
coeﬃcients appearing in Lemma 4.4.3 (or at least the 2-adic valuation) of ζ(weight) for each
of these terms, conjectured in 4.4.4, which is the only missing part of the proof, and can be
solved at the analytic level.

4.4.1 Level graded coaction

Let use the following form for a MMZV(cid:63), gathering the 2:

ζ (cid:63),m(2a0, c1,··· , cp, 2ap ),

ci ∈ N∗, ci (cid:54)= 2.

This writing is suitable for the Galois action (and coaction) calculus, since by the antipode
relations (§4.2), many of the cuts from a 2 to a 2 get simpliﬁed (cf. Annexe §A.1).
For the Hoﬀman family, with only 2 and 3, the expression obtained is:II

In particular, the coaction on the Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements is stable.

resp. (r, bl−1, . . . , b0), such that the diagonal corresponds to r = al and bi = ai for i < l and
claim:

Claim 3: The matrix Mn,l of ∂L

<n,l on the Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements is invertible

corresponding to D2r+1 by (2−v2(r)−2). Then modulo 2, because of the previous computa-
tions on the 2-adic valuations of the coeﬃcients, only the deconcatenations terms remain.
Hence, with the previous order, the matrix is, modulo 2, triangular with 1 on the diago-

Proof of Claim 3. Indeed, let (cid:102)Mn,l be the matrix Mn,l where we have multiplied each line
nal; the diagonal being the case where B0,r−1Cr appears. This implies that det((cid:102)Mn,l) ≡ 1
(mod 2), and in particular is non zero. Consequently, the matrix (cid:102)Mn,l is invertible and so
does Mn,l.
Obviously, Claim 3 ⇒ Claim 2, but it will also enables us to complete the proof:
Proof of Claim 1. Let ﬁrst prove it for the Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements of a same level and weight,
by recursion on level. Level 0 is obvious: ζ (cid:63),m(2)n is a rational multiple of (πm)2n. Assuming
by recursion on the level that the Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements of weight ≤ n and level l−1 are linearly
independent, since Mn,l is invertible, this means both that the Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements of weight
n and level l are linearly independent.
The last step is to realize that the bijectivity of ∂L
of diﬀerent levels are linearly independent.
applying ∂L
of 3, we arrive at an equality between same level elements, and at a contradiction.

<n,l also implies that Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements
Indeed, proof can be done by contradiction:

Before giving the proof, here is the (analytic) conjecture remaining on some of these coeﬃ-
cients, suﬃcient to complete the Hoﬀman (cid:63) basis proof (cf. Theorem 4.4.1):
Conjecture 4.4.4. The equalities (v) are satisﬁed for real MZV, with:

Ba,b = 1 −

2

Ca+b+1(cid:18)2a + 2b + 2
2b + 1 (cid:19).

Remarks:
· This conjecture is of an entirely diﬀerent nature from the techniques developed in
this thesis. We can expect that it can proved using analytic methods as the usual
techniques of identifying hypergeometric series, as in [82], or [63].
· The equality (iv) is already proven in the analytic case by Ohno-Zagier (cf.[56], [82]),
with the values of the coeﬃcient Aa,b
r given below. Nevertheless, as we will see through
the proofs below, to make the coeﬃcients for the (stronger) motivic identity (iv) ex-
plicit, we need to prove the other identities in (v).
· We will use below a result of Ohno and Zagier on sums of MZV of ﬁxed weight, depth
and height to conclude for the coeﬃcients for (iii).

Theorem 4.4.5. If the analytic conjecture (4.4.4) holds, the equalities (iv), (v) are true in
the motivic case, with the same values of the coeﬃcients. In particular:

Aa,b

r = 2(cid:18)−δr=a +(cid:18)2r

2a(cid:19)(cid:19) 22r

22r − 1 − 2(cid:18) 2r
2b + 1(cid:19).

Proof. Remind that if we know a motivic equality up to one unknown coeﬃcient (of ζ(weight)),
the analytic result analogue enables us to conclude on its value by Corollary 2.4.5.
Let assume now, in a recursion on n, that we know {Ba,b, Da,b, Ba,b
s1···sp }a+b+1<n and con-
sider (a, b) such that a + b + 1 = n. Then, by (4.31), we are able to compute the Ba,b
i
s
with (s, i) (cid:54)= (1, n). Using the analytic (v) equality, and Corollary 2.4.5, we deduce the only
remaining unknown coeﬃcient Ba,b resp. Da,b in (v).
let assume they are known for
Lastly, by recursion on n we deduce the Aa,b

Proof of Lemma 4.4.3.

:

Proof. Computing the coaction on these elements, by a recursive procedure, we are able to
prove these identities up to some rational coeﬃcients, with the Corollary 2.4.5. When the
analytic analogue of the equality is known for MZV, we may conclude on the value of the
remaining rational coeﬃcient of ζ m(w) by identiﬁcation (as for (i), (ii), (iii)). However, if
the family is not stable under the coaction , (as for (iv)) knowing the analytic case is not
enough.
Nota Bene: This proof refers to the expression of D2r+1 in Lemma A.1.1: we look at cuts
of length 2r + 1 among the sequence of 0, 1, or (cid:63) (in the iterated integral writing); there are
diﬀerent kind of cuts (according their extremities), and each cut may bring out two terms
(T0,0 and T0,(cid:63) for instance). The simpliﬁcations are illustrated by the diagrams, where some
arrows (term of a cut) get simpliﬁed by rules speciﬁed in Annexe A.

(i) The corresponding iterated integral:

I m(0; 1, 0, (cid:63), 0··· , (cid:63), 0; 1).

73

The only possible cuts of odd length are between two (cid:63) (T0,(cid:63) and T(cid:63),0) or T1,0 from the
ﬁrst 1 to a (cid:63), or T0,1 from a (cid:63) to the last 1. By Shift (A.2), these cuts get simpliﬁed
two by two. Since D2r+1(·), for 2r + 1 < 2n are all zero, it belongs to Qζ m(2n), by
Corollary 2.4.5). Using the (known) analytic equality, we can conclude.

(ii) It is quite similar to (i): using Shift (A.2), it remains only the cut:

i.e. : D2r+1(ζ (cid:63),m

1

(2n)) = ζ l,(cid:63)

1 (2r) ⊗ ζ (cid:63),m(2n−r) = −2ζ l(2r + 1) ⊗ ζ (cid:63),m(2n−r).

The last equality is deduced from the recursive hypothesis (smaller weight). The
analytic equality (coming from the Zagier-Ohno formula, and the  regulation) enables
us to conclude on the value of the remaining coeﬃcient of ζ m(2n + 1).

(iii) Expressing these ES(cid:63)(cid:63) as a linear combination of ES by  regularisation:

Using the multi-binomial formula:

ζ m
2n−

ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),m(2n) = (cid:88)ki even
(cid:80) mi = (cid:88)li≤mi(cid:18)m1

Thus:

(cid:80) ki(k1,··· , kp) = (cid:88)ni≥2
l1(cid:19)(1 − (−1))l1 ···(cid:18)md

Similarly for (4.27), since:

ζ m

(cid:80) ki(k1,··· , kp) =(cid:88)d≤n (cid:88)w(m)=2n

ht(m)=d(m)=d
Now, using still only Shift (A.2), it remains the following cuts:

22n−2dζ m(m).

With a recursion on n for both (4.26), (4.27), we deduce:

D2r+1(ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),m(2n)) = ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),m
(2n)) = ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

To ﬁnd the remaining coeﬃcients, we need the analytic result corresponding, which is

ζ (cid:63)(cid:63)(2n) = (cid:88)(cid:80)(2ik +1)sk +2S=2n

It is completely similar for ζ (cid:63)(cid:63)
obtained the analytic analogue of (4.25), with the same coeﬃcients dS and cr.
Now, using these analytic results for (4.26), (4.27), by recursion on the weight, we can
identify the coeﬃcient DS and Cr with resp. dS and cr, since there is one unknown
coeﬃcient at each step of the recursion.

(iv) After some simpliﬁcations by Antipodes rules (§A.1), only the following cuts remain:

This leads to the formula:

It leads to the constraint (4.30) above for coeﬃcients A. To make these coeﬃcients
explicit, apart from the known analytic Ohno Zagier formula, we need the analytic
analogue of (v) identities, as stated in Conjecture 4.4.4.

(v) By Annexe rules, the following cuts get simpliﬁed (by colors, above with below):I

Indeed, cyan arrows get simpliﬁed by Antipode , T0,0 resp. T0,(cid:63) above with T0,0

shifted by two on the left. It remains the following cuts for (4.28):

In a very similar way, the simpliﬁcations lead to the following remaining terms:

4.5 Motivic generalized Linebarger Zhao Conjecture

We conjecture the following motivic identities, which express each motivic MZV (cid:63) as a
motivic Euler (cid:93) sum:
Conjecture 4.5.1. For ai, ci ∈ N∗, ci (cid:54)= 2,

ζ (cid:63),m (2a0, c1,··· , cp, 2ap ) = (−1)1+δc1 ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)B0, 1c1−3,··· , 1ci−3, Bi, . . . , Bp(cid:1) ,
where

and 1n := 1min(0,n) is a sequence of n 1 if n ∈ N, an empty sequence else.

B0 := ±(2a0 + 1 − δc1 )
Bi := ±(2ai + 3 − δci − δci+1)
Bp := ±(2ap + 2 − δcp )

, with ± :=(cid:26) − if

| Bi | even
| Bi | odd

, δc := δc=1,

+ if

Remarks:
· Motivic Euler (cid:93) sums appearing on the right side have already been proven to be
unramiﬁed in §4.3, i.e. MMZV.
· This conjecture implies that the motivic Hoﬀman (cid:63) family is a basis, since it corre-
sponds here to the motivic Euler (cid:93) sum family proved to be a basis in Theorem 4.3.2:
cf. (4.36).
· The number of sequences of consecutive 1 in ζ (cid:63), n1 is linked with the number of even
in ζ (cid:93), ne, here by the following formula:

the Kronecker symbol.

In particular, when there is no 1 in the MMZV (cid:63), there is only one even (at the end)
in the Euler sum (cid:93). There are always at least one even in the Euler sums.

ne = 1 + 2n1 − 2δcp − δc1.

Special cases of this conjecture, which are already proven for real Euler sums (references

indicated in the braket), but remain conjectures in the motivic case:
Two-One [Ohno Zudilin, [69].]

ζ (cid:63),m(2a0, 1,··· , 1, 2ap ) = −ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)2a0, 2a1 + 1, . . . , 2ap−1 + 1, 2ap + 1(cid:1) .

ζ (cid:63),m (2a0 , c1,··· , cp, 2ap ) = −ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0)2a0 + 1, 1c1−3,··· , 1ci−3, 2ai + 3, . . . , 2ap + 2(cid:1)(4.35)

Examples: Particular identities implied by the previous conjecture, sometimes known for
MZV and which could then be proven for motivic Euler sums directly with the coaction:

· ζ (cid:63),m(1,{2}n) = 2ζ m(2n + 1).
· ζ (cid:63),m(1,{2}a , 1,{2}b) = ζ (cid:93)m(2a + 1, 2b + 1) = 4ζ m(2a + 1, 2b + 1) + 2ζ m(2a + 2b + 2).
· ζ m(n) = −ζ (cid:93),m({1}n−2,−2) = −(cid:80) w(k)=n
· ζ (cid:63),m({2}n) =(cid:80) k∈{ even }×
We paved the way for the proof of Conjecture 4.5.1, bringing it back to an identity in L:
Theorem 4.5.2. Let assume:

2pζ m(k1, . . . , kp−1,−kp).

ζ m(k) = −2ζ m(−2n).

(4.38)

ADDENDUM: The hypothesis (i) is proved: J. Zhao deduced it from its Theorem 1.4 in [86].

Remark: The (ii) hypothesis should be proven either directly via the various relations
in L proven in §4.2 (as for 4.38), or using the coaction, which would require the analytic
identity corresponding. Beware, (ii) would only be true in L2, not in H2.
Proof. To prove this equality 1. at a motivic level by recursion, we would need to proof
that the coaction is equal on both side, and use the conjecture analytic version of the same
equality. We prove I and II successively, in a same recursion on the weight:

I. Using the formulas of the coactions Dr for these families (Lemma A.1.2 and A.1.4), we
can gather terms in both sides according to the right side, which leads to three types:

ζ (cid:63),m(··· , 2ai, α, 2β, cj+1,··· )
←→ ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , Bi, 1γ, B, 1γj+1, . . . , Bp)
ζ (cid:63),m(··· , 2ai−1 , ci, 2β, cj+1,··· ) ←→ ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , Bi−1, 1γi , B, 1γj+1, . . . , Bp)
ζ (cid:63),m(··· , ci, 2β, α, 2aj ,··· )
←→ ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , 1γi+1, B, 1γ, Bj+1, . . . , Bp)

(a)
(b)
(c)
with γ = α − 3 and B = 2β + 3 − δcj+1, or B = 2β + 3 − δci − δcj+1 for (b).
The third case, antisymmetric of the ﬁrst case, may be omitted below. By recur-
sive hypothesis, these right sides are equal and it remains to compare the left sides
associated:

,

(a) On the one hand, by lemma A.1.2, the left side corresponding:

than 3.

B0−B+1(Bp, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(Bp − B + 1, 1γp ,··· , 1γ1, B0).

Using resp. Antipode Shift (A.2) for the ﬁrst line, and re-ordering the
indices, it is equivalent to, with c1 ≥ 3, B0 = 2a0 + 1 − δc1 here:
(2a0, c1 − 1,··· , cp, 2ap )

(4.41)
≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
B0−1(1γ1,··· , 1γp , Bp).
This matches with the identity 4.37; the last equality coming from Shift since
depth is odd.

B0+Bp−1(1γp ,··· , 1γ1) ≡ ζ (cid:93),l

(c) Antisymmetric of the ﬁrst case.

II. Let us denote the sequences X = 2a1, . . . , 2ap and Y = 1γ1−1, B1,··· , 1γp.

We want to prove that:

ζ (cid:93),l(1, Y, Bp) ≡ −ζ (cid:63),l

1 (c1 − 1, X)

(4.42)

c1 (X)

Relations used are mostly these stated in §4.2. Using the deﬁnition of ζ (cid:63)(cid:63):
−ζ (cid:63),l

1 (c1 − 1, X) ≡ −ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

(c1 − 1, X) + ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l

≡ −ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l(1, c1 − 1, X) + ζ (cid:63),l(1, c1 − 1, X) + ζ (cid:63)(cid:63),l(c1, X) − ζ (cid:63),l(c1, X)
≡ ζ (cid:63),l(1, c1 − 1, X) − ζ (cid:63),l(c1, X) − ζ (cid:63),l(c1 − 1, X, 1).
(4.43)
There, the ﬁrst and third term in the second line, after applying Shift, have given the
last ζ (cid:63) in the last line.
Using then Conjecture 4.5.1, in terms of MMZV(cid:93), then MMZV(cid:93)(cid:93), it gives:
ζ (cid:93),l(2, Y, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93),l(1, 1, Y, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93),l(1, Y, Bp − 1, 1)

≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(2, Y, Bp − 1) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
− ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

(Y, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(1, 1, Y, Bp − 1)

1

(Y, Bp − 1, 1)

(4.44)

First term (odd depth)I is simpliﬁed with the last, by Schift. Fifth term (even depth)
get simpliﬁed by Cut with the fourth term. Hence it remains two terms of even depth:

≡ −ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

2

(Y, Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(1, 1, Y, Bp − 1) ≡ −ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

1

(Y, Bp) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

Bp−1(1, 1, Y),

where Minus resp. Cut have been applied. This matches with (4.42) since, by Shift :

≡ −ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

1

(Y, Bp) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(1, Y, Bp) ≡ ζ (cid:93),l(1, Y, Bp).

The case c1 = 3 slightly diﬀers since (4.43) gives, by recursion hypothesis I.(4.5.1):
1 (2, X) ≡ ζ (cid:93),l(B1 + 1, Y(cid:48), Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93),l(1, B1, Y(cid:48), Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93),l(B1, Y(cid:48), Bp − 1, 1),
−ζ (cid:63),l
where Y(cid:48) = 1γ2,··· , 1γp, odd depth. Turning into MES(cid:93)(cid:93), and using identities of §4.2
in the same way than above, leads to the result. Indeed, from:

≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(B1 + 1, Y(cid:48), Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(1, B1, Y(cid:48), Bp − 1) + ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(B1, Y(cid:48), Bp − 1, 1)

−ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

B1+1(Y(cid:48), Bp − 1) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

1

(B1, Y(cid:48), Bp − 1) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

B1

(Y(cid:48), Bp − 1, 1)

ISince weight is odd, we know also depth parity of these terms.

81

First and last terms get simpliﬁed via Shift, while third and ﬁfth term get simpliﬁed
by Cut; besides, we apply minus for second term, and minus for the fourth term,
which are both of even depth. This leads to 4.38, using again Shift for the ﬁrst term:

Bp−1(1, B1, Y(cid:48)) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
≡ ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l(B1, Y(cid:48), Bp) − ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
≡ ζ (cid:93),l(B1, Y(cid:48), Bp).

Similarly, with µi :=(cid:26) (cid:63) if ηi = 1

Φm(e−1, e0, e∞) =(cid:80) I m(cid:0)0; (ω1 − ω−1)a0ωµ1(ω1 − ω−1)a1 ··· ωµp (ω1 − ω−1)ap ; 1(cid:1) ea0

Lastly, still using φτ σ, with here µi :=(cid:26) (cid:63) if ηi = 1
1 if ηi = −1
Φm(e1, e∞, e0) =(cid:80) I m(cid:0)0; (ω−1 − ω1)a0ωµ1(ω−1 − ω1)a1 ··· ωµp (ω−1 − ω1)ap ; 1(cid:1) ea0

The ﬁrst case is deduced from 4.12 when looking at the coeﬃcient of a word beginning
and ending by e−1 (or beginning and ending by e1), whereas the second case is obtained
from the coeﬃcient of a word beginning by e−1 and ending by e1, or beginning by e1
and ending by e−1.

(ii) Let split into two cases, according to the sign of(cid:81) i:

· In 4.12, when looking at the coeﬃcient of a word beginning by e1 and ending by
e0, only these three terms contribute:

Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)e0 − Φl(e∞, e−1, e1)e0 − e1Φl(e1, e∞, e0).

Moreover, the coeﬃcient of e−1ea0
for Φl(·):

0 eη1 ··· eηp eap+1

0

is, using the expressions above

(−1)pI l(0;−1,−X; 1) + (−1)w+1I l(0;−(cid:63),−X(cid:63); 1) + (−1)wI l(0; X(cid:63), 0; 1) = 0,
0 ωη1 ··· ωηp ωap
.
0 ωη1(cid:63) ··· ωηp(cid:63)ωap

where X := ωa0
X(cid:63) := ωa0

In terms of motivic Euler sums, it is, with(cid:81) i = 1:
ζ l(n0,··· ,−np)+(−1)w+pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l(n0,··· ,−np)+(−1)w+pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l
Changing np into −np, and applying Antipode  to the last term, it gives, with
now(cid:81) i = −1:
ζ l(n0,··· , np) + (−1)w+pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l(n0,··· , np) + (−1)pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l
· Similarly, for the coeﬃcient of a word beginning by e−1 and ending by e0, only
these three terms contribute:

np (np−1,··· , n1, n0) = 0.

0

0

n0−1(n1,··· , np−1, np‘+’1) = 0.

Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)e0 − Φl(e∞, e−1, e1)e0 + e−1Φl(e∞, e−1, e1).

Similarly than above, it leads to the identity, with(cid:81) i = −1:
ζ l(n0,··· ,−np)+(−1)w+pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l(n0,··· ,−np)+(−1)w+pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l
Changing np into −np, and applying Antipode  to the last term, it gives, with
now(cid:81) i = 1:
ζ l(n0,··· , np) + (−1)w+p+1ζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l(n0,··· , np) + (−1)pζ (cid:63)(cid:63)l

np (np−1,··· , n1, n0) = 0.
(iii) When looking at the coeﬃcient of a word beginning by e0 and ending by e0 in 4.12,

n0−1(n1,··· , np−1,−(np‘+’1)) = 0.

only these three terms contribute:

−e0Φl(e−1, e0, e∞) + Φl(e−1, e0, e∞)e0 + e0Φl(e∞, e−1, e1) − Φl(e∞, e−1, e1)e0.

If we identify the coeﬃcient of the word ea0+1

, it leads straight to

Remark: Looking at the coeﬃcient of words beginning by e0 and ending by e1 or e−1 in
4.12 would lead to the same identity than the second case.

4.7 Appendix 2: Missing coeﬃcients

In Lemma 4.4.3, the coeﬃcients Da,b appearing (in (v)) are the only one which are not
conjectured. Albeit these values are not required for the proof of Theorem 4.4.1, we provide
here a table of values in small weights. Let examine the coeﬃcient corresponding to ζ (cid:63)(2n)
instead of ζ (cid:63)(2)n, which is (by (i) in Lemma 4.4.3), with n = a + b + 1:

We have an expression (4.32) for Dn, albeit not very elegant, which would give:

Galois Descents

Contents: The ﬁrst section gives the general picture (for any N), sketching the Galois de-
scent ideas. The second section focuses on the cases N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8, deﬁning the ﬁltrations
by the motivic level associated to each descent, and displays both results and proofs. Some
examples in small depth for are given in the Annexe §A.2.
Notations: For a ﬁxed N, let kN := Q(ξN ), where ξN ∈ µN is a primitive N th root of
unity, and ON is the ring of integers of kN. The subscript or exponent N will be omit-
ted when it is not ambiguous. For the general case, the decomposition of N is denoted
N =(cid:81) qi =(cid:81) pα

5.1 Overview
Change of ﬁeld. As said in Chapter 3, for each N, N(cid:48) with N(cid:48)|N, the Galois action on
HN and HN(cid:48) is determined by the coaction ∆. More precisely, let consider the following
descentI, assuming φN(cid:48) is an isomorphism of graded Hopf comodules: II

This is a very useful recursive criterion (derivation strictly decreasing weight and depth)
to determine if a (motivic) multiple zeta value at µN is in fact a (motivic) multiple zeta
value at µN(cid:48), modulo smaller depth terms; applying it recursively, it could also take care of
smaller depth terms. This criterion applies for motivic MZVµN , and by period morphism is
deduced for MZVµN .

If the descent has just a ramiﬁed part, the criterion can be
stated in a non depth graded version. Indeed, there, since only weight 1 matters, to deﬁne
the derivation space D(cid:100) as above (5.1), we need to choose a basis for O∗N ⊗ Q, which we

quences and speciﬁcations for N = 2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8 individually are provided in §5.2.5. Some
examples in small depth are displayed in Appendice A.2.

Consequences, level i = 0:

· The level 0 of the basis elements BN forms a basis of HN = HMT N , for N =
2, 3, 4, ‘6’, 8. This gives a new proof (dual) of Deligne’s result (in [31]).
The level 0 of this ﬁltration is hence isomorphic to the following algebras:I

5.2.4 Proofs

∂i,(cid:100)n,p : grD

n → ⊕r<n(cid:16)grD
p H≥i

We will look at its image on Bn,p,≥i and prove both the injectivity of ∂i,(cid:100)n,p as considered in
Lemma 5.2.3, and the linear independence of these elements Bn,p,≥i.

Terms of type (d) play a particular role since they correspond to deconcatenation for the
coaction, and will be the terms of minimal 2-adic valuation.

Let prove all statements of Lemma 5.2.3, recursively on the weight, and then recursively on
depth and on the level, from i = 0.
Proof. By recursion hypothesis, weight being strictly smaller, we assume that:

Claim: The matrix M i

on these spaces is invertible.

n,p of(cid:16)∂i,(cid:100)n,p(z)(cid:17)z∈Bn,p,≥i

Nota Bene: Here D−1
2r+1,p(z) are expressed in terms of Bn−1,p−1,≥i−1 resp.
Bn−2r−1,p−1,≥i.
It will prove both the bijectivity of ∂i,(cid:100)n,p as considered in the lemma and the linear indepen-
dence of Bn,p,≥i. Let divide M i
n,p into four blocks, with the ﬁrst column corresponding to
elements of Bn,p,≥i ending by 1:

D1,p
D>1,p

xp = 0

M1
M3

xp > 0

M2
M4

1.

According to (5.9), D−1
1,p is zero on the elements not ending by 1, and acts as a deconcate-
nation on the others. Therefore, M3 = 0, so M i
n,p is lower triangular by blocks, and the
left-upper-block M1 is diagonal invertible. It remains to prove the invertibility of the right-
>1,p and to the elements of Bn,p,≥i not ending by

lower-block (cid:102)M := M 4, corresponding to D−1
Notice that in the formula (5.8) of D2r+1,p, applied to an element of Bn,p,≥i, most of terms
appearing have a number of 1 greater than i but there are also terms in Bn−2r−1,p−1,i−1,
with exactly (i − 1) “1” for type a,b,c only. We will make disappear the latter modulo 2,
since they are 2-adically greater.
More precisely, using recursion hypothesis (in weight strictly smaller), we can replace them
n−2r−1 by a Zodd-linear combination of elements in Bn−2r−1,p−1,≥i, which does
in grp−1H≥i
not lower the 2-adic valuation. It is worth noticing that the type d elements considered are
now always in Bn−2r−1,p−1,≥i, since we removed the case xp = 0.
Once done, we can construct the matrix (cid:102)M and examine its entries.
Order elements of B on both sides by lexicographic order of its “reversed” elements:

(xp, xp−1,··· , x1) for the colums, (r, yp−1,··· , y1) for the rows.

Remark that, with such an order, the diagonal corresponds to the deconcatenation terms:
r = xp and xi = yi.

(d,d’), that is:

valuation positive or equal to zero, since the coeﬃcients in (5.8) are in 22rZodd (for types
a,b,c) or of the form Zodd for types d,d’. If we look only at the terms with 2-adic valuation

Referring to (5.8), and by the previous remark, we see that (cid:102)M has all its entries of 2-adic
zero, (which comes to consider (cid:102)M modulo 2), it only remains in (5.8) the terms of type
D2r+1,p(ζ m(2x1 + 1, . . . , 2xp + 1)) ≡ δr=xp+xp−1(cid:18) 2r
+ δxp≤r<xp+xp−1(cid:18) 2r

2xp(cid:19)ζ m(2x1 + 1, . . . , 2xp−2 + 1, 2(xp−1 + xp − r) + 1)

2xp(cid:19)ζ m(2x1 + 1, . . . , 2xp−2 + 1, 1)

(mod 2).

Therefore, modulo 2, with the order previously deﬁned, it remains only an upper triangular

matrix (δxp≤r), with 1 on the diagonal (δxp=r, deconcatenation terms). Thus, det(cid:102)M has
a 2-adic valuation equal to zero, and in particular can not be zero, that’s why(cid:102)M is invertible.
The Zodd structure is easily deduced from the fact that the determinant of (cid:102)M is odd, and

the observation that if we consider D2r+1,p(ζ m(z1, . . . , zp)), all the coeﬃcients are integers.

Proof of Lemma 5.2.3 for other N. These cases can be handled in a rather similar
way than the case N = 2, except that the number of generators is diﬀerent and that several
descents are possible, hence there will be several notions of level and ﬁltrations by the
motivic level, one for each descent. Let ﬁx a descent (cid:100) and underline the diﬀerences in the
proof:
Proof. In the same way, we prove by recursion on weight, depth and level, that the following
map is bijective:

Or ζ (l)(cid:16) r

Using results in depth 1 of Deligne and Goncharov (cf. §2.4.3), the deconcatenation terms
are P -adically smaller.
For instance, for N = ‘6’, r odd:

Thanks to congruences modulo P , only the deconcatenation terms remain:

Note that ζ m(2) being trivial under the coaction, the matrix M9,3 is diagonal by blocks
following the diﬀerent values of s and we can prove the invertibility of each block separately;

here we restrict to the block s = 0. The matrix (cid:102)M considered represents the coeﬃcients of:

The chosen order for the columns, resp. for the rows I is the lexicographic order applied to
(c, b, a) resp. to (r, y, x). Modulo 2, it only remains the terms of type d,d’, that is:

n deﬁning a Zodd-structure:

As announced, (cid:102)M modulo 2 is triangular with 1 on the diagonal, thus obviously invertible.
Proof of the Theorem 5.2.4.
Proof. This Theorem comes down to the Lemma 5.2.3 proving the freeness of Bn,p,≥i in
p H≥i
grD
(i) By this Lemma, Bn,p,≥i is linearly free in the depth graded, and ∂i,(cid:100)n,p, which decreases
strictly the depth, is bijective on Bn,p,≥i. The family Bn,≤p,≥i, all depth mixed is then
: easily proved by application of ∂i,(cid:100)n,p.
linearly independent on F D

n ⊂ grD
Then, by a dimension argument, since dim grD
= card Bn,p,≥i we conclude on
the generating property. The Zodd structure has been proven in the previous lemma.
By the bijectivity of ∂i,(cid:100)n,p (still previous lemma), which decreases the depth, and using
the freeness of the elements of a same depth in the depth graded, there is no linear
. The family
relation between elements of Bn,·,≥i of diﬀerent depths in H≥i
considered is then linearly independent in H≥i
, we
conclude on the equality of the previous inclusions.

II.e. for ζm(2a + 1, 2b + 1, 2c + 1) resp. for (D2r+1,3, ζm(2x + 1, 2y + 1)).
IINotice that the ﬁrst four rows are exact: no need of congruences modulo 2 for D1 because it acts as a

deconcatenation on the base.

94

(iii) The second exact sequence is obviously split since Bn,·,≥i+1 is a subset of Bn. We
. Therefore, it

already know that Bn is a basis of Hn and Bn,·,≥i+1 is a basis of H≥i+1
gives a map Hn ← H≥i+1
The construction of cln,≤p,≥i(x), obtained from cln,p,≥i(x) applied repeatedly, is the
following:

x ∈ Bn,·,≤i−1 is sent on ¯x ∈ H≥i

n ∼= (cid:104)Bn,≤p,≥i(cid:105)Q by the projection π0,i and so
x − ¯x ∈ Fi−1H.

Notice that the problem of making cl(x) explicit boils down to the problem of describing
the map π0,i in the bases B.

(iv) By the previous statements, these elements are linearly independent in FiHM T

n . More-
over, their cardinal is equal to the dimension of FiHM T
n . It gives the basis announced,
composed of elements x ∈ Bn,·,≤i, each corrected by an element denoted cl(x) of
(cid:104)Bn,·,≥i+1(cid:105)Q.

(v) By the previous statements, these elements are linearly independent in griHn, and by

a dimension argument, we can conclude.

5.2.5 Speciﬁed Results
5.2.5.1 The case N = 2.
Here, since there is only one Galois descent from H2 to H1, the previous exponents for level
ﬁltrations can be omitted, as the exponent 2 for H the space of motivic Euler sums. Set
Zodd =(cid:8) a
b , a ∈ Z, b ∈ 2Z + 1(cid:9), rationals having a 2-adic valuation positive or inﬁnite. Let
us deﬁne particular families of motivic Euler sums, a notion of level and of motivic level.
· B2 :=(cid:8)ζ m(2x1 + 1, . . . , 2xp−1 + 1, 2xp + 1)ζ(2)m,k, xi ≥ 0, k ∈ N(cid:9) .
Deﬁnition 5.2.5.

Here, the level is deﬁned as the number of xi equal to zero.
· The ﬁltration by the motivic (Q/Q, 2/1)-level,

2r+1Z ∈ FiH(cid:9) .
FiH :=(cid:8)Z ∈ H, such that D−1
I.e. Fi is the largest submodule such that Fi/Fi−1 is killed by D1.

1 Z ∈ Fi−1H , ∀r > 0, D1

This level ﬁltration commutes with the increasing depth ﬁltration.

Remarks: The increasing or decreasing ﬁltration deﬁned from the number of 1 appear-
ing in the motivic multiple zeta values is not preserved by the coproduct, since the number
of 1 can either decrease or increase (by at the most 1) and is therefore not motivic.

Let list some consequences of the results in §5.2.3, which generalize in particular a result
similar to P. Deligne’s one (cf. [31]):
Corollary 5.2.6. The map GMT → GMT (cid:48) is an isomorphism.
The elements of Bn, ζ m(2x1 +1, . . . , 2xp + 1)ζ(2)k of weight n, form a basis of motivic Euler
sums of weight n, H2
The period map, per : H → C, induces the following result for the Euler sums:
Each Euler sum is a Zodd-linear combination of Euler sums
ζ(2x1 + 1, . . . , 2xp + 1)ζ(2)k, k ≥ 0, xi ≥ 0 of the same weight.

Honorary. About the ﬁrst condition in 5.1.3 to be honorary:
Lemma 5.2.8. Let ζ m(n1,··· , np) ∈ H2, a motivic Euler sum, with ni ∈ Z∗, np (cid:54)= 1.
Then:

∀i , ni (cid:54)= −1 ⇒ D1(ζ m(n1,··· , np)) = 0

Proof. Looking at all iterated integrals of length 1 in L, I l(a; b; c), a, b, c ∈ {0,±1}: the
only non zero ones are these with a consecutive {1,−1} or {−1, 1} sequence in the iterated
integral, with the condition that extremities are diﬀerent, that is:

I(0; 1;−1), I(0;−1; 1), I(1;−1; 0), I(−1; +1; 0), I(−1;±1; 1), I(1;±1;−1).

Moreover, they are all equal to ± loga(2) in the Hopf algebra A. Consequently, if there is
no −1 in the Euler sums notation, it implies that D1 would be zero.
Comparison with Hoﬀman’s basis. Let compare:
(i) The Hoﬀman basis of H1 formed by motivic MZV with only 2 and 3 ([20])

BH := {ζ m(x1, . . . , xk), where xi ∈ {2, 3}} .

Beware, the index p for BH indicates the number of 3 among the xi, whereas for B1, it

(ii) B1, the base of H1 previously obtained (Corollary 5.2.7).
still indicates the depth; in both case, it can be seen as the motivic depth (cf. §2.4.3):

Miscellaneous uses of the

6.1 Maximal depth terms, grD

The coaction enables us to compute, by a recursive procedure, the coeﬃcients of the terms
maxHn. In particular, let look at:
of maximal depth, i.e. the projection on the graded grD

· For N = 1, when weight is a multiple of 3 (w = 3d), such as depth p > d:

p H3d = Qζ m(3)d.

· Another simple case is for N = 2, 3, 4, when weight equals depth, which is referred to
as the diagonal comodule:

n is usually more than 1 dimensional, but the methods presented below

6.1.1 MMZV, weight 3d.
Preliminaries: Linearized Ihara action. The linearisation of the map ◦ : U g ⊗ U g → U g
induced by Ihara action (cf. §2.4) can be deﬁned recursively on words by, with η ∈ µN:

◦ : U g ⊗ U g → U g : a◦en

where ∗ stands for the following involution:

0 eη(a◦w),

(6.1)

For this paragraph, from now, let N = 1 and let use the commutative polynomial setting,
introducing the isomorphism:

(a1 ··· an)∗ := (−1)nan ··· a1.

(6.2)

Remind that if Φ ∈ U g satisﬁes the linearized  relation, it means that Φ is primitive for
∆, and equivalently that φuv = 0, with φw the coeﬃcient of w in Φ. In particular, this

100

is veriﬁed for Φ in the motivic Lie algebra gm.
This property implies for f = ρ(Φ) a translation invariance (cf. 6.2 in [21])

f (y0, y1,··· , yp) = f (0, y1 − y0, . . . , yp − y0).

Let consider the map:

Q(cid:104)Y (cid:105) −→ Q(cid:104)X(cid:105) = Q(cid:104)x1, . . . , xn,···(cid:105),

f (cid:55)−→ f

where f (x1,··· , xp) := f (0, x1,··· , xp).

If f is translation invariant, f (y0, y1, . . . , yp) = f (y1 − y0,··· , yp − y0).
The image of gm under ρ is contained in the subspace of polynomial in yi invariant by
translation. Hence we can consider alternatively in the following φ ∈ gm, f = ρ(φ) or f.
Since the linearized action ◦ respects the D-grading, it deﬁnes, via the isomorphism ρ :
DU g → Q[y0, . . . , yr], graded version of (6.2), a map:
grr
◦ : Q[y0, . . . , yr]⊗Q[y0, . . . , ys] → Q[y0, . . . , yr+s] , which in the polynomial representation is:

Remarks:

· This is proved for motivic multiple zeta values, and by the period map, it also applies
to multiple zeta values.
· This lemma (as the next one, more precise) could be generalized for unramiﬁed motivic
Euler sums.
· All the coeﬃcients α are all integers.

Proof. Recursively, let consider:

By the deﬁnition of the linearized Ihara action (6.5):

Pn+1(x1,··· , xn+1) := x2

1◦Pn(x1,··· , xn).

(6.11)

Pn+1(x1,··· , xn+1) =

which gives the recursive formula of the lemma.

102

Generalization. Another proof of the previous lemma is possible using the dual point of
view with the depth-graded derivations D3,p, looking at cuts of length 3 and depth 1.I
A motivic multiple zeta value of weight 3d and of depth p > d could also be expressed as:

ζ m(n1, . . . , np) =

αn
d!

ζ m(3)d + terms of depth strictly smaller than d.

(6.12)

However, to compute this coeﬃcient αn, we could not work as before in the depth graded;
i.e. this time, we have to consider all the possible cuts of length 3. Then, the coeﬃcient
emerges when computing (D3)◦d.
Lemma 6.1.2. The coeﬃcient of ζ m(3)d in ζ m(n1, . . . , np) of weight 3d such that p > d, is

(6.13)
Proof. Let list ﬁrst all the possible cuts of length 3 and depth 1 in a iterated integral with
{0, 1}:

The coeﬃcient above the arrow is the coeﬃcient of ζ m(3) in I m(cut), using that:

ζ m
1 (2) = −2ζ m(3),

ζ m(1, 2) = ζ m(3),

ζ m(2, 1) = −2ζ m(3),

ζ m
1 (1, 1) = ζ m(3).

Therefore, when there is a 1 followed or preceded by something greater than 4, the contri-
bution is ±1, while when there is a 2 followed or preceded by something greater than 3, the

when followed of preceded by something greater than 2 get simpliﬁed (except if there is a 3
at the very end); when a 3 is followed resp. preceded by a 1 however, we assimilate it to the
contribution of a 1 preceded resp. followed by a 3; which leads exactly to the penultimate
lemma.
Additionally to the cuts listed above:

This analysis leads to the given formula.

In particular, a sequence of the type Y 12X resp. X21Y (X ≥ 2, Y ≥ 3) will imply a

(3) resp. (−3) times the coeﬃcient of the same sequence without 12, resp. 21.

6.2 Families of unramiﬁed Euler sums.

The proof relies upon the criterion 5.1.3„ which enables us to construct inﬁnite families of
unramiﬁed Euler sums with parity patterns by iteration on the depth, up to depth 5.

Notations: The occurrences of the symbols E or O can denote arbitrary even or odd inte-
gers, whereas every repeated occurrence of symbols Ei (respectively Oi) denotes the same
positive even (resp. odd) integer. The bracket {·, . . . ,·} means that every permutation of
the listed elements is allowed.

Remarks:

· This result for motivic ES implies the analogue statement for ES.
· Notice that for each honorary MZV above, the reverse sum is honorary too, which was
not obvious a priori, since the condition c1 below is not symmetric.

IBeware, here, O and n must be diﬀerent from 1, whereas O and n may be 1. There is no 1 allowed in these

terms if not explicitly written.

that all the elements appearing in the right side of D2r+1 are unramiﬁed, by recursion on
depth: here, these elements satisfy the suﬃcient criteria given below. Let only point out a
few things, referring to the expression (6.17):
Terms c: The symmetry condition (c4), obviously true for these single elements above, get
rid of these terms. For the few linear combinations of MES given, the cuts of type (c)
get simpliﬁed together.

Terms a,b: Checking that the right sides are unramiﬁed is straightforward by depth-recursion
hypothesis, since only the (previously proven) unramiﬁed elements of lower depth
emerge. For example, the possible right sides (not canceled by a symmetric cut and
up to reversal symmetry) are listed below, for some elements from depth 3.

Suﬃcient condition. Let Z = ζ m(n1, . . . , np) a motivic Euler sum. These four conditions
are suﬃcient for Z to be unramiﬁed:
c1 : No 1 in Z.
c2 : For each (n1, . . . , ni) of odd weight, the MES ζ m(ni+1, . . . , np) is a MMZV.
c3 : If a cut removes an odd-weight part (such that there is no symmetric cut possible),

the remaining MES (right side in terms a,b), is a MMZV.

Proof. The condition c1 implies that D1(Z) = 0; conditions c2, resp. c3 take care that
the right side of terms a0, resp. a,b are unramiﬁed, while the condition c4 cancels the
(disturbing) terms c: indeed, a single ES with an 1 can not be unramiﬁed.

c4 : Each sub-sequence (ni, . . . , nj) of even weight such that(cid:81)j
Note that a MES Z of depth 2, weight n is unramiﬁed if and only if(cid:26) D1(Z) = 0

k=i k (cid:54)= 1 is symmetric.

Dn−1(Z) = 0

.

107

Nota Bene: This criterion is not necessary: it does not cover the unramiﬁed Q-linear com-
binations of motivic Euler sums, such as those presented in section 4, neither some isolated
(symmetric enough) examples where the unramiﬁed terms appearing in D2r+1 could cancel
between them. However, it embrace general families of single Euler sums which are unram-
iﬁed.

Moreover,

If we comply with these conditions, the only general families of single MES obtained

are the one listed in Theorem 6.2.1.

Sketch of the proof. Notice ﬁrst that the condition c4 implies in particular that there are
no consecutive sequences of the type (since it would create type c terms):

Seq. not allowed : OO, OO, EE, EE.

It implies, from depth 3, that we can’t have the sequences (otherwise one of the non allowed
depth 2 sequences above appear in a,b terms):

Seq. not allowed : EEO, EEEO, EEOE, EOE, EEO, OEE, EOE, EOE, OOO.

Going on in this recursive way, carefully, leads to the previous theorem.
For instance, let Z a MES of even weight, with no 1, and let detail two cases:
Depth 3: The right side of D2r+1 has odd weight and depth smaller than 2, hence is always
MMZV if there is no 1 by depth 2 results. It boils down to the condition c4: Z must
be either symmetric (such as O1EO1 or E1EE1 with possibly one or three overlines)
either have exactly two overlines. Using the analysis above of the allowed sequences in
depth 2 and 3 for condition c3,4 leads to the following:

(E, O, O), (O, O, E), (O, E, O), (O, E, O), (O, E, O), (O1, E, O1), (O1, E, O1), (E1, E, E1).

Depth 4: Let Z = ζ m (n1, . . . , n4), i = sign(ni). To avoid terms of type c with a right
if 123 (cid:54)= 1, either n1 + n2 + n3 is odd, or n1 = n3 and 2 = −1;
side of depth 1:
if 234 (cid:54)= 1, either n2 + n3 + n4 is odd, or n2 = n4 and 3 = −1. The following
sequences are then not allowed:

(E, O, O, E), (E, O, O, E), (E, O, E, O), (E, E, O, O), (O, O, E, E).

6.3 Motivic Identities

As we have seen above, in particular in Lemma 4.4.3, the coaction enables us to prove some
identities between MMZV or MES, by recursion on the depth, up to one rational coeﬃcient
at each step. This coeﬃcient can be deduced then, if we know the analogue identity for
MZV, resp. Euler sums. Nevertheless, a motivic identity between MMZV (resp. MES)
is stronger than the corresponding relation between real MZV (resp. Euler sums); it may
hence require several relations between MZV in order to lift an identity to motivic MZV. An
example of such a behaviour occurs with some Hoﬀman (cid:63) elements, ((iv) in Lemma 4.4.3).

In this section, we list a few examples of identities, picked from the zoo of existing identi-
ties, that we are able to lift easily from Euler sums to motivic Euler sums: Galois trivial
elements (action of the unipotent part of the Galois group being trivial), sums identities, etc.

Nota Bene: For other cyclotomic MMZV, we could somehow generalize this idea, but there

108

would be several unknown coeﬃcients at each step, as stated in Theorem 2.4.4. For N = 3
or 4, we have to consider all Dr, 0 < r < n, and there would be one resp. two (if weight
even) unknown coeﬃcients at each step ; for N = ‘6’, if unramiﬁed, considering Dr, r > 1,
there would be also one or two unknown coeﬃcients at each step.

Example: Here is an identity known for Euler sums, proven at the motivic level by re-
cursion on n via the coaction for motivic Euler sums (and using the analytic identity):

Proof. These three families are stable under the coaction:

ζ m({3}n) = ζ m({1, 2}n) = 8nζ m({1, 2}n).

(6.18)

D2r+1(ζ m({3}n))
D2r+1(ζ m({1, 2}n)) = δ2r+1=3sζ a({1, 2}s) ⊗ ζ m({1, 2}n−s).
D2r+1(ζ m({1, 2}n)) = δ2r+1=3sζ a({1, 2}s) ⊗ ζ m({1, 2}n−s).

= δ2r+1=3sζ a({3}s)

⊗ ζ m({3}n−s).

Indeed, in both case, in the diagrams below, cuts (3) and (4) are symmetric and get simpli-
ﬁed by reversal, as cuts (1) and (2), except for last cut of type (1) which remains alone:

Similarly for ζ m({1, 2}n): cuts of type (3), (4) resp. (1), (2) get simpliﬁed together, except
the ﬁrst one, when  = (cid:48) in the diagram below. The other possible cuts of odd length would
be (5) and (6) below, when  = −(cid:48), but each is null since antisymmetric.

Galois trivial. The Galois action of the unipotent group U is trivial on Q[Lm,2n] =
Q[ζ m(2)n]. To prove an element of H2n is a rational multiple of Lm,2n, it is equivalent
to check it is in the kernel of the derivations D2r+1, for 1 ≤ 2r + 1 < 2n, by Corollary 2.4.5.
We have to use the (known) analogue identities for MZV to conclude on the value of such
a rational.

Example:

· Summing on all the possible ways to insert n 2’s.
ζ m({1, 3}p with n 2 inserted ) =(cid:18)2p + n
n (cid:19)
· More generally, with ﬁxed (ai) such that(cid:80) ai = n: I

(6.20)

Proof. In order to justify why all the derivations D2r+1 cancel, the possible cuts of odd
length are, with X = {01}a2i+2+1{10}a2i+3+1 ···{01}a2j−2{10}a2j−1:

· Cut (1) for (a0, . . . , a2p) with Cut (2) for (a0, . . . , a2i−1, a2j+1 ··· , a2i, a2j+2,··· , a2p).
· Similarly between (3) and (4), which get simpliﬁed considering the sequence where
(a2i+1, . . . , a2j) is reversed.

Sum formulas. Here are listed a few examples of the numerous sum identities known for
Euler sumsIII which we can lift to motivic Euler sums, via the coaction. For these identities,
as we see through the proof, the action of the Galois group is trivial; the families being
stable under the derivations, we are able to lift the identity to its motivic version via a
simple recursion.

Proof. We refer to the formula of the derivations Dr in Lemma A.1.1. For many of these
equalities, when summing over all the permutations of a certain subset, most of the cuts
will get simpliﬁed two by two as followed:
ζ m (k1, . . . , ki, ki+1, . . . , kj, kj+1,··· kd) : 0;··· 10ki−110ki+1−1 ··· 0kj−1−110kj−110kj+1−1 ··· ; 1.
ζ m(k1,··· , ki, kj,··· , ki+1, kj+1, . . . , kd) : 0;··· 10ki−110kj−1 ··· 0ki+2−110ki+1−110kj+1−1 ··· ; 1.
It remains only the ﬁrst cuts, beginning with the ﬁrst 0, such as:

(6.22)

(6.21)

and possibly the cuts from a ki = 1 to kd, if the sum is over admissible MMZV: I

j=1 kj ζ m (k1, . . . , ki) ⊗ ζ m(ki+1, . . . , kd) ,

(6.24)
(i) From the terms above in D2r+1, (6.21), and (6.22) get simpliﬁed together, and there are
no terms (6.23) since the ai are all even. Therefore, it is in the kernel of ⊕2r+1<2nD2r+1
with even weight, hence Galois trivial.
For instance, for ζ m((cid:8)2n(cid:9)p

), with , (cid:48) ∈ {±1}:

Either,  = (cid:48) and X is symmetric, and by reversal of path (cf. §A.1.1), cuts above get
simpliﬁed, or  = −(cid:48) and X is antisymmetric, and the cuts above still get simpliﬁed
since I m(; 0a+1X; 0) = −I m(0; (cid:101)X0a+1; ) = −I m(0; X0a+1;−).

(ii) Let us denote this sum G(n, d), and G1(n, d) the corresponding sum where a 1 at the
end is allowed. As explained in the proof’s preamble, the remaining cuts being the
ﬁrst ones and the one from a ki = 1 to the last kd:

IThere, beware, the MZV at the left side can end by 1.

···0a0X00a0···,X=02n−a−2{±02n−1}i−002n−a−2,alternatedsigninX.if0=−(iii) This can be proven also computing the coaction, or noticing that it can be deduced
from Euler relation above, turning a MZV(cid:63) into a sum of MZV of smaller depth, it
turns to be:

d(cid:88)i=1 (cid:88)w(k)=n,d(k)=i(cid:18)n − i − 1

d − i (cid:19)ζ m(k).

For the Aoki-Ohno identity, using the formula for MZV (cid:63), and with recursion hypoth-
esis, we could similarly prove that the coaction is zero on these elements, and conclude
with the result for MZV.

(iv) Let us denote this sum G−(n, s) and G−,(1)(n, s) resp. G−,1(n, s) the analogue sums
with possibly a 1 at the end, resp. with necessarily a 1 at the end. Looking at
the derivations, since we sum over all the permutations of the admissible indices, all
the cuts get simpliﬁed with its symmetric cut as said above, and it remains only the
beginning cut (with the ﬁrst 0), and the cut from a kj = 1 to the last kd, which leads
to:

s−1(cid:88)i=0(cid:16)Gl
s−1(cid:88)i=0

D2r+1(G−(n, s)) =

(Gl

−(2r + 1, i + 1)) ⊗ G−(n − 2r − 1, s − i).
Using recursion hypothesis, it cancels, and thus, Galt(n, s) ∈ Qζ m(n). Using the
analogue analytic equality, we conclude.

−(2r + 1, i) − Gl

(v) For odd sequences with alternating constraints (> 1 or ≥ 1 for instance), cuts between
ki and kj will get simpliﬁed with some symmetric terms in the sum, except possibly
(when odd length), the ﬁrst (i.e. from the ﬁrst 1 to a ﬁrst 0) and the last (i.e. from
a last 0 to the very last 1) one. More precisely, with O any odd integer, possibly all

A.1 Coaction

The coaction formula given by Goncharov and extended by Brown for motivic iterated
integrals applies to the (cid:63), (cid:63)(cid:63), (cid:93) or (cid:93)(cid:93) version by linearity I. Here is the version obtained for
MMZV (cid:63), (cid:63)(cid:63), (cid:93) or (cid:93)(cid:93):II

IRecall the identities 2.29 to turn a (cid:63) (resp. (cid:93)) into a 1 (resp. two times a 1) minus a 0.
IIFor purpose of stability: if there is a ±1 at the beginning, as for (cid:63) or (cid:93) versions, the cut with this ﬁrst ±1
will be let as a T±1,0 term (and not converted into a T,0 less a T0,0), in order to still have a ±1 at the beginning;
whereas, if there is no ±1 at the beginning, as for (cid:63)(cid:63) or (cid:93)(cid:93) version even the ﬁrst cut (ﬁrst line) has to be converted
into a T0, less a T0,0, in order to still have a  at the beginning.

115

Remarks:

· We will refer to these diﬀerent terms T for each cut in the whole appendix when using
the coaction.
· The expression of Dr for speciﬁc MMZV (cid:63) and Euler (cid:93) sums is simpliﬁed below thanks
to antipodal and hybrid relations, and is fundamentally used in the proofs of Chapter
4.

Proof. The proof is straightforward from (2.45), using the linearity (with 2.29) in both
directions:
(i) First, to turn  into a diﬀerence of ±1 minus 0 in order to use (2.45).
(ii) Then, in the right side, a ±1 appeared inside the iterated integral when looking at
the usual coaction formula which is turned into a sum of a term with  (denoted T,0
or T0,) and a term with 0 (denoted T0,0) by linearity of the iterated integrals and in
order to end up only with 0,  in the right side.

Listing now the diﬀerent cuts leads to the expression of the lemma, since:
· The ﬁrst line corresponds to the initial cut (from the s + 1 ﬁrst 0).
· The second line corresponds to a cut either from ± to 0; the ± being ±1.
· The third line corresponds to a cut from 0 to ±.
· The fourth line corresponds to cut from  to , with two choices: a  being ﬁxed to 0,
the other one ﬁxed to 1. Replacing 1 by () + (0), this leads to a T0,, a T,0 and two
T0,0 terms which get simpliﬁed together.
· The last lines correspond to cuts from  to −, with three possibilities: one being ﬁxed
to 0, the other one ﬁxed to ±1, or the ﬁrst being 1, the second −1. This leads to a
T,0, a T0,− and a T,−, since the T0,0 terms get simpliﬁed.

A.1.1 Simpliﬁcation rules

This section is devoted on the simpliﬁcation of the coaction, in the case of motivic Euler
sums: we gather terms in D2r+1 according to their right side, using relations (§4.2) between
motivic iterated integrals I l ∈ L to simplify the left side.
Notations: We use the notation of the iterated integrals inner sequences and represent
a term of a cut in D2r+1 (referring to Lemma 4.4.2) by arrows between two elements of
this sequence. The weight of the cut (which is the length of the subsequence in the iterated
integral) would always be considered odd here.I The diagrams show which terms get sim-
pliﬁed together: i.e. these which have same right side, but opposite left side, by the relation
considered in the coalgebra L.
Composition : The composition rule (cf. §1.6) in the coalgebra L boils down to:

I l(a; X; b) ≡ −I l(b; X; a),

(A.1)
It allows us to switch the two extremities of the integral if we multiply by −1 the
integral: this exchange is considerably used below, without mentioning.

with X any sequence of 0,±1,±(cid:63),±(cid:93).

ISince we are here only interested in motivic Euler sums, the non zero weight graded parts in the coaction are

these corresponding to odd weights: D2r+1, r ≥ 0.

116

Antipode : It corresponds to a reversal of path for iterated integrals (cf. 4.7):

I l(a; X; b) ≡ (−1)wI l(b; (cid:101)X; a) for any X sequence of 0,±1,±(cid:63),±(cid:93). Hence:
· If X symmetric, i.e. (cid:101)X = X, these two cuts get simpliﬁed,
since I l(; Xi+1; 0) ≡ −I l(0; i+1(cid:101)X; ) ≡ −I l(0; i+1X; ).
· If X antisymmetric, i.e. (cid:101)X = −X,the cut
≡ I l(; X; 0) − I l(−; (cid:101)X; 0)

I l(; X;−) ≡ I l(; X; 0) + I l(0; X;−)
≡ I l(; X; 0) − I l(−;−X; 0)
≡ 0

is zero since:

A.1.2 MMZV (cid:63)
Let express each MMZV(cid:63) as:

ζ (cid:63),m(2a0 , c1,··· , cp, 2ap ).

As we will see below, this writing is suitable for the coaction expression, since most of the
cuts from a 2 to another 2 get simpliﬁed by the rules above. The iterated integral corre-
sponding:

A.1.3 Euler (cid:93) sums with even, odd
Let us consider the following family:

which, in terms of iterated integrals corresponds to, with  ∈ {±(cid:93)}:

ζ (cid:93),m(cid:0){even, odd}×(cid:1) , i.e. negative even and positive odd integers
I m(cid:18)0;(cid:26) 1, 0odd,−(cid:93)
, 0even,  (cid:27) ,··· ; 1(cid:19) .
Lemma A.1.3. The family ζ (cid:93)m ({even, odd}×) is stable under the coaction.
Proof. Looking at the possible kinds of cuts, and gathering them according the right side:

1, 0even, (cid:93) (cid:27) ,··· , (cid:26) , 0odd,−

(A.9)

These cuts have the same form for the right side in the coaction:

I m(0;··· , i0αj,··· ; 1).

Notice there would be no term T,− in a cut from  to − because of Sign (A.6) identity,
therefore you have there all the possible cuts pictured.
A priori, cuts can create in the right side a sequence {, 0even,−} or(cid:8), 0odd, (cid:9) inside the
iterated integral; these cuts are the unstable ones, since they are out of the considered fam-
ily. However, by coupling these cuts two by two, and using the rules listed at the beginning
of the Annexe, the unstable cuts would all get simpliﬁed.
Indeed, let examine each of the terms (1 − 6)I:

IThere is no remaining cuts between  and . Notice also that the left sides of the remaining terms have an

even depth.

where B is positive if odd, negative if even.

Proof. Nota Bene: For the left side, we only look at odd weight w, and the parity of the
depth d is fundamental since the relations stated above depend on the parity of w − d.
For instance, for such a sequence (1γi, Bi, . . . , Bj−1, 1γj ) (with the previous notations),
weight − depth has the same parity than δci + δcj .
The following cuts get simpliﬁed, with Shift, since depth is odd (Bi odd if ci, ci+1 (cid:54)= 1):

It remains, where all the unstable cuts are simpliﬁed by the Lemma A.1.4, cuts that we can
gather into four groups, according to the right side of the coaction:
(i) ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , Bi, 1γ, B, 1γj+1, . . . , Bp).
(ii) ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , Bi, 1γ, Bj, . . . , Bp).
(iii) ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , Bi, 1γi+1, B, 1γj+1, . . . , Bp).
(iv) ζ (cid:93),m(B0 ··· , 1γi+1, B, 1γ, Bj+1, . . . , Bp).
It remains, where (iv) terms, antisymmetric of (i) ones, are omitted to lighten the diagrams:

IIHere δr indicates that left side has to be of weight 2r + 1.

(i) Looking at the magenta terms, with 2 ≤ B ≤ Bj−1 or B = Bj +1 and 0 ≤ γ ≤ γi+1−1:

ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
Bj−B+1(1γj , . . . , 1γi+1−γ−1)−ζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l
With even depth for the ﬁrst term and odd for the second since otherwise the cuts
would be unstable and simpliﬁed by Cut; here also ci+1 (cid:54)= 1.

Bj−B(1γj , . . . , 1γi+1−γ) = −ζ (cid:93),l(Bj−B+1, 1γj , . . . , 1γi+1−γ−1)

(ii) These match exactly with the left side of (i) for B = Bj and (iv) terms for B = Bi.

(iii) The following cuts:

δBi+1≥Bζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

δBi+1<Bζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

Bi+1−B(1γi+2, . . . , Bj) − δBj≥Bζ (cid:93)(cid:93),l

Bj−B(1γj , . . . , Bi+1)+
Bi+1+Bj−B(1γi+2, . . . , 1γj ).

The parity of weight− depth for the ﬁrst line is equal to the parity of δci+1 + δcj+1 + B.
Notice that if this is even, the ﬁrst line has odd depth whereas the second line has even
depth, and by Cut and Antipode∗, all terms got simpliﬁed. Hence, we can restrict
to B written as 2β + 3 − δci+1 − δcj+1, the ﬁrst line being of even depth, the second
line of odd depth.

(iv) Antisymmetric of (i).

A.2.1 N = 2: Depth 2, 3
Here we have to consider only one Galois descent, from H2 to H1.
In depth 1 all the ζ m(s), s > 1 are MMZV. Let us detail the case of depth 2 and 3 as an
application of the results of Chapter 5. In depth 2, coeﬃcients are explicit:
Lemma A.2.1. The depth 2 part of the basis of the motivic multiple zeta values is:

(cid:26)ζ m(2a + 1, 2b + 1) −(cid:18)2(a + b)

2b (cid:19)ζ m(1, 2(a + b) + 1), a, b > 0(cid:27) .

Proof. Indeed, we have if a, b > 0, D1(ζ m(2a + 1, 2b + 1)) = 0 and for r > 0:

2a(cid:19) + δr=a + δb≤r<a+b(cid:18)2r

D2r+1,2(ζ m(2a + 1, 2b + 1)) = ζ l(2r + 1) ⊗ ζ m(2(a + b − r) + 1)
2b (cid:19)(cid:19) .
(cid:18)−δa≤r<a+b(cid:18)2r
There is only the case r = a+b where a term (ζ m(1)) which does not belong to F0H appears:
2b (cid:19)ζ l(2r+1)⊗ζ m(1) in the quotient H≥1.
D2r+1,2(ζ m(2a+1, 2b + 1)) ≡ δr=a+b(2−2r−2)(cid:18)2(a + b)

2b(cid:19)(2−2r − 1) + δr=a+b(2−2r − 2)(cid:18)2(a + b)

Referring to the previous results, we can correct ζ m(2a + 1, 2b + 1) with terms of the same
weight, same depth, and with at least one 1 (not at the end), which here corresponds only
to ζ m(1, 2(a + b) + 1).
Furthermore, the last equality being true in the quotient H≥1:
D2r+1,2(ζ m(1, 2(a + b) + 1)) = ζ l(2r + 1) ⊗ (−δr<a+b + δr=a+b(2−2r − 2))ζ m(2(a + b − r) + 1)

According to these calculations of inﬁnitesimal coactions:

ζ m(2a + 1, 2b + 1) −(cid:18)2(a + b)

≡ δr=a+b(2−2r − 2)ζ l(2r + 1) ⊗ ζ m(1).
2b (cid:19)ζ m(1, 2(a + b) + 1) belongs to F0H , i.e. is a MMZV.

Examples: Here are some motivic multiple zeta values:
ζ m(3, 3) − 6ζ m(1, 5) , ζ m(3, 5) − 15ζ m(1, 7) , ζ m(5, 3) − 15ζ m(1, 7) , ζ m(5, 7) − 210ζ m(1, 11).

Remarks:

· The corresponding Euler sums(cid:110)ζ(2a + 1, 2b + 1) −(cid:0)2(a+b)

2b (cid:1)ζ(1, 2(a + b) + 1), a, b > 0(cid:111)

ζ(A, B)
ζ(A, B)

are a generating family of MZV in depth 2.
· Similarly, we can prove that the following elements are (resp. motivic) MZV, if no 1:
if A, B odd
ζ(A, B) (cid:27) if A + B odd
if A + B even

A.3 Homographies of P1(cid:31){0, µN , ∞}
The homographies of the projective line P1 which permutes {0, µN ,∞}, induce automor-
phisms P1(cid:31){0, µN ,∞} → P1(cid:31){0, µN ,∞}. The projective space P1(cid:31){0, µN ,∞} has a di-
hedral symmetry, the dihedral group DiN = Z(cid:30)2Z (cid:110) µN acting with x (cid:55)→ x−1 and x (cid:55)→ ηx.
In the special case of N = 1, 2, 4, and for these only, the group of homographies is bigger
than the dihedral group, due to particular symmetries of the points µN ∪ {0,∞} on the
Riemann sphere. Let specify these cases:

For N = 1 : The homography group is the anharmonic group generated by z (cid:55)→ 1

z and z (cid:55)→ 1 − z,

For N = 4 : P1(cid:31){0, 1,−1, i,−i,∞} has an octahedral symmetry, and the homography group is the
group of automorphisms of this octahedron placed on the Riemann sphere of vertices
(0, 1, i,−1,−i,∞).I It is composed by 48 transformations, corresponding to 24 rota-
tional symmetries, and a reﬂection.

We could also look at other projective transformations: P1(cid:31){0, µN ,∞} → P1(cid:31){0, µN(cid:48),∞}N(cid:48)|N.
Examples:

· P1(cid:31){0,−1,∞} → P1(cid:31){0, +1,∞} , t (cid:55)→ 1 + t.
· P1(cid:31){0,−1,∞} → P1(cid:31){0, +1,∞} , t (cid:55)→ 1
1+t.
· P1(cid:31){0,±1,∞} → P1(cid:31){0, 1,∞} , t (cid:55)→ t2.

IZhao showed this octahedral symmetry allows to reach the “non standard” relations which appeared in weight
3, 4 for N = 4; non standard relations are these which do not come from distribution, conjugation, and regularised
double shuﬄe relation, cf. [84].

A.4 Hybrid relation for MMZV
The commutative polynomial setting is brieﬂy introduced in §6.1.1.
Let consider the following involution, which represents the Antipode  as seen in §4.2.1:
(A.13)

f (y0, y1,··· , yp) (cid:55)→ (−1)wf (yp, yp−1,··· , y1),

σ : Q(cid:104)Y (cid:105) → Q(cid:104)Y (cid:105) ,

with w the weight, equal to the degree of f plus p. In particular, for f ∈ ρ(gm):

Antipode  : f + σ(f ) = 0.

Note that f (p) denotes the part of f involving y0,··· , yp. We can also consider:

τ : Q(cid:104)X(cid:105) → Q(cid:104)X(cid:105) ,

(p)

f

(x1, . . . , xp) := (cid:88)s≤p,ik
p=(cid:80) ik

The hybrid relation (Theorem 4.2.3) for motivic multiple zeta values is equivalent to, in this
setting of commutative polynomials to the following, already in some notes of F. Brown:
Theorem (F. Brown). For f ∈ ρ(gm), the 6 terms relation holds:

(p)

f

(x1,··· , xp) +

(p−1)

f

(x2 − x1, . . . , xp − x1) − f

(d−1)

(x2,··· , xp)

(p)

(p−1)

f

(xp−1 − xp, . . . , x1 − xp) − f

xp

(p−1)

(xp−1,··· , x1)

(cid:33) .

Before giving the proof, to be convinced these statements are equivalent, let just write f as:

f =(cid:88) αn1,...,nk xn1−1

··· xnk−1

(p−1)

(x2,··· ,xp)

Then:

This, according to the shuﬄe regularization (2.28), matches exactly with the deﬁnition of
k (k1, . . . , kp−1).

Proof of the previous theorem. The proof combines the shuﬄe relation (using that f is trans-
lation invariant notably), the linearized stuﬄe relation (giving a relation between depth p
and depth p − 1) and the antipode .
Let’s take f in ρ(gm) and let consider the diﬀerence

I(y0, y1,··· , yp) := f (p)(y0, y1,··· , yp) + (−1)wf (p)(y0, yp,··· , y1)

(A.18)

= f (p)(y0, y1,··· , yp) − f (p)(y1,··· , yp, y0).

Consider also the relation given by the linearized stuﬄe relation (in L), between depth p
and depth p − 1, deﬁning St:

Where St can then be expressed by f (p−1) using stuﬄe:

St(y0, y1y2 ··· yp) =(cid:88) 1

The theorem is then equivalent to the following identity

St(y0, y1  y2 ··· yp) := f (p)(y0, y1  y2 ··· yp),
yi − y1(cid:16)f (p−1)(y0, y2, ,··· yi−1, y1, yi+1, . . . , yp) − f (p−1)(y0, y2,··· , yp)(cid:17) .

(A.19)

(A.20)

(1) I(y0, y1,··· , yp) = (−1)w+1St(yp, y0  yp−1 ··· y1) − St(y1, y0  y2 ··· yp).

Indeed, looking at the previous deﬁnition (A.20 ), most of the terms of St in the right side
of (1) get simpliﬁed together, and it remains only:

(−1)w+1 f (p−1)(yp, . . . , y2, y0) − f (p−1)(yp,··· , y1)

y1 − y0

−

f (p−1)(y1, . . . , yp−1, y0) − f (p−1)(y1,··· , yp)

yp − y0

.

Passing to the xi variables, we conclude that (1) is equivalent to the theorem’s statement;
let now prove (1). By deﬁnition:
St(y1, y0y2 ··· yp) = f (p)(y1, y0y2 ··· yp) = f (p)(y1, y0y2 ··· yp−1, yp)+f (p)(y1, y2, . . . , yp, y0).
Doing a right shift, using the deﬁnition of I:

St(y1, y0  y2 ··· yp)

(A.21)

= f (p)(yp, y1, y0y2 ··· yp−1)−I(yp, y1, y0y2 ··· yp−1)+f (p)(y0, y1, y2 ··· , yp)−I(y0, y1, y2 ··· , yp).
Since:
f (p)(yp, y1, y0  y2 ··· yp−1) = St(yp, y0  y1y2 ··· yp−1) − f (p)(yp, y0, y1, y2, . . . , yp−1)
f (p)(y0, y1, y2 ··· , yp) = −I(yp, y0, y1, y2, . . . , yp−1) + f (p)(yp, y0, y1, y2, . . . , yp−1).

Then, (A.21) becomes:

St(y1, y0  y2 ··· yp) − St(yp, y0  y1y2 ··· yp−1)

= −I(yp, y0, y1, y2, . . . , yp−1) − I(yp, y1, y0  y2 ··· yp−1) − I(y0, y1, y2 ··· , yp).

The sum of the ﬁrst two I is I(yp, y0  y1 ··· yp−1) which gives:

I(y0, y1, y2 ··· , yp) = −St(y1, y0y2 ··· yp)+St(yp, y0y1y2 ··· yp−1)−I(yp, y0y1 ··· yp−1)
(A.22)

= −St(y1, y0  y2 ··· yp) + (−1)w+1St(yp, y0  yp−1 ··· y1).

The identity (1) holds, and the identity of the theorem follows.
