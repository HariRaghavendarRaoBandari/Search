A spatial model for selection and cooperation

Peter Czuppon, Peter Pfaﬀelhuber

March 3, 2016

Abstract

We study the evolution of cooperation in an interacting particle system with two types.
The model we investigate is an extension of a two-type biased voter model. One type
(called defector) has a (positive) bias α with respect to the other type (called cooperator).
However, a cooperator helps a neighbor (either defector or cooperator) to reproduce at
rate γ. We prove that the one-dimensional nearest-neighbor interacting dynamical system
exhibits a phase transition at α = γ. For α > γ cooperators always die out, but if γ > α,
cooperation is the winning strategy.

Introduction

In nature cooperative behavior amongst individuals is widely spread. It is observed in animals,
e.g. [GW03, Clu09] as well as in microorganisms, e.g. [Cre01, WL06]. While understanding
this phenomenon by models, theoretical approaches introduced diﬀerent interpretations and
forms of cooperation, mostly within the area of game theory [Now06]. In all such approaches,
a defector (or selﬁsh) type tends to have more oﬀspring, but there are cases when it is
outcompeted by the cooperator type under some circumstances. Although, in all of the models
describing cooperation the question of extinction and survival of a type or the coexistence
of several types are main subjects of the mathematical analysis, the frameworks for the
theoretical studies may vary. While (stochastic) diﬀerential equations are mainly used for
non-spatial systems (see for example [AS12, HJM15+]), the theory of interacting particle
systems provides a suitable setup for the analysis of models with local interactions between
the particles, [BK11, SS15, EL16]. In this paper we deﬁne a model using the latter structure
and terminology.

Investigations of models incorporating cooperation are interesting because of the following
dichotomy:
in non-spatial (well-mixed) situations, the whole population beneﬁts from the
cooperative behavior. If defectors have a higher ﬁtness than cooperators, defectors always
outcompete cooperators in the long run. However, if the system is truely spatial, cooperators
can form clusters and then use their cooperative behavior in order to defend themselves
against defectors, even though those might have higher (individual) ﬁtness. This heuristics
implies that only structured models can help to understand cooperative behavior in nature.
Due to the variety of interpretations of cooperative behavior there are diﬀerent ways of im-
plementing these mechanisms in a spatial context. In the ﬁeld of population dynamics, Sturm

1

and Swart [SS15] study an interacting particle system containing a cooperative-branching
mechanism which can be understood as a sexual reproduction event. In [BK11], Blath and
Kurt study a branching-annihilating random walk and again, a cooperation mechanism is
interpreted as sexual reproduction. Diﬀerent to that, the model introduced by Evilsizor and
Lanchier in [EL16] originates from the game-theoretical study of a two player game with dif-
ferent strategies where the strategies can be altruistic or selﬁsh. Here, the altruistic strategies
represent the cooperator type.

Various interacting particle systems which appear in the literature are monotone, i.e. two
versions of the system, which start in conﬁgurations where one dominates the other, can be
coupled such that this property holds for all times; see e.g. [SS15] for a monotone model
mentioned above. For such processes, there exist several general results (cf.
[Lig85]) which
provide some useful techniques helping in the analysis. However, cooperation often leads
to non-monotone interacting particle systems; compare with [BK11], [EL16], and the one
presented here. The reason here is that cooperators (or altruists) do not distinguish between
non-cooperators and their own type which usually contradicts the monotonicity condition.

The motivation for the present paper came from studies of bacterial cells which divide
(reproduce) in dependence of their neighboring types. The idea is that there are two types
(defector=0, cooperator=1), where only cooperators produce some public good which helps
neighboring cells to reproduce. However, this production is costly which means that defectors
will have a selective advantage over the cooperator type. The resulting model is a biased voter
model with an additional cooperation mechanism. The main objective of our paper is to study
the long-time behavior of such a model dependent on the parameters of the system.

In particular, we prove for our main model in one dimension that the system clusters in-
dependently of the parameter conﬁguration. When starting in a translation invariant starting
conﬁguration, for α > γ, defectors take over the colony, whereas for γ > α cooperators win;
see Theorem 1. Additionally, in higher dimensions, at least we can show that the parameter
region where defecting particles win is larger than for d = 1; compare with Theorem 2. We
also show that a ﬁnite number of cooperators dies out if α > γ, but may survive if γ > α.
The converse holds true for the defectors; see Theorem 3.

The paper is structured as follows. First, we give a general deﬁnition of the model in
Section 2. After the deﬁnition we derive some properties of the model, show its existence and
consider some special cases and related systems. In Section 3 we state limit results for the
main model and its derivatives, mainly restricted to the one-dimensional lattice. The rest of
the paper is devoted to the proofs of the theorems.

2 The model and ﬁrst results

2.1 The model

Let V be a countable vertex set, and (a(u, v))u,v∈V be a (not necessarily symmetric) Markov
kernel from V to V . Additionally, (b(u, (v, w))u∈V,(v,w)∈V ×V is a second Markov kernel from
V to V × V . We study an interacting particle system X = ((Xt(u))u∈V )t≥0 with state space
{0, 1}V , where Xt(u) ∈ {0, 1} is the type at site u at time t. A particle in state 0 is also
called defector and a particle in state 1 is called cooperator. The dynamics of the interacting
particles system, which is a Markov process, is (informally) as follows: For some α, γ ≥ 0:

2

• Reproduction: A particle at site u ∈ V reproduces with rate a(u, v) to site v, i.e. X(v)

changes to X(u). (This mechanism is well-known from the voter model.)

• Selection:

If X(u) = 0 (i.e. there is a defector at site u ∈ V ), it reproduces with
additional rate α a(u, v) to site v, i.e. X(v) changes to 0. (A defector has a ﬁtness
advantage over the cooperators by this additional chance to reproduce. This mechanism
is well-known from the biased voter model.)

• Cooperation: If X(u) = 1 (i.e. there is a cooperator at site u ∈ V ), the individual at
site v (no matter which state it has) reproduces to site w at rate γ b(u, (v, w)) ≥ 0. (A
cooperator at site u helps an individual at site v to reproduce to site w.)

Remark 2.1 (Interpretation).

1. Selection: Since cooperation imposes an energetic cost
on cooperators, the non-cooperating individuals, can use these free resources for re-
production processes. This leads to a ﬁtness advantage which we describe with the
parameter α.

2. Cooperation: The idea of the cooperation mechanism in our model is that each cooper-
ater supports a neighboring individual, independent of its type, to reproduce to another
adjacent site according to the Markov kernel b. A biological interpretation for this
supportive interaction is a common good produced by cooperators and released to the
environment helping the colony to expand. The corresponding interaction parameter
is γ.
Below, we will deal with two situations, depending on whether b(u, (v, u)) > 0 or
b(u, (v, u)) = 0.
In the former case, we speak of an altruistic system, since a coop-
erator at site u can help the particle at site v to kill itself. In the latter case, we speak
of a cooperative system.

In order to uniquely deﬁne a Markov process, we will need the following assumption.

Assumption 2.2 (Markov kernels). The Markov kernels a(., .) and b(., (., .)) satisfy

(cid:88)

u∈V

a(u, v) < ∞ for all v ∈ V

and

(cid:88)

u,v∈V

b(u, (v, w)) < ∞ for all w ∈ V.

Remark 2.3 (Some special cases). A special case is when

b(u, (v, w)) = a(u, v) · a(v, w).

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

Then, (2.2) is implied by the assumption

(cid:88)

u∈V

sup
v∈V

a(u, v) < ∞,

3

which is stronger than (2.1). We will also deal with a similar case but when b(u, (v, u)) = 0
(which means that u cannot help v to replace u), precisely, if a(v, u) < 1,

b(u, (v, w)) = a(u, v) · a(v, w)1{w(cid:54)=u}
w(cid:48)(cid:54)=u a(v, w(cid:48))

(cid:80)

.

(2.4)

2.2 Existence and uniqueness of the process

In order to become more formal, we deﬁne the (pre-)generator of the process X via its
transition rates. Given X ∈ {0, 1}V , the rate of change c(u, X) from X to

X u(v) =

X(v),
1 − X(u),

v ∈ V \{u};
v = u;

(cid:40)

(cid:88)

u∈G

are as follows:
If X(u) = 0, then

(cid:88)

c(u, X) =

a(v, u)X(v) + γ

(cid:88)

v

(cid:88)

w

X(v)

X(w)b(w, (v, u)).

(2.5)

v

If X(u) = 1, then

c(u, X) = (1 + α)

(cid:88)

v

a(v, u)(1 − X(v)) + γ

(cid:88)

v

(1 − X(v))

(cid:88)

w

X(w)b(w, (v, u)).

(2.6)

Here, the ﬁrst sum in c(u, X) represents the rates triggered by reproduction and selection
whereas the last terms emerge from the cooperation mechanism.

The existence of a unique Markov process corresponding to the transition rates c(u, X) is
guaranteed by standard-theory, see for example [Lig85, Chapter 1]. Precisely, we deﬁne the
(pre-)generator Ω of the process through

(Ωf )(X) =

c(u, X)(f (X u) − f (X)),

(2.7)

where f ∈ D(Ω), the domain of Ω, is given by

D(Ω) := {f ∈ C({0, 1}V ) depends only on ﬁnitely many coordinates},

with C({0, 1}V ) the set of continuous functions on {0, 1}V . We note that D(Ω) is dense
in Cb({0, 1}V ), the set of bounded continuous functions on {0, 1}V , because of the Stone-
Weierstrass-Theorem. We ﬁnd the following general statement.

Proposition 2.4 (Existence of unique Markov process). If Assumption 2.2 holds, the tran-
sition rates c(., .) given in (2.5) and (2.6) deﬁne a unique Markov process X on {0, 1}V .
Moreover, the closure ¯Ω of Ω is the generator of X.

4

Proof. We need to show that the closure of Ω in C({0, 1}V ) is a generator of a semi-group
which then uniquely deﬁnes a Markov process (see for example [Lig85, Theorem 1.1.5]). In
order to show this we follow [Lig85, Theorem 1.3.9] and check the following two conditions:

sup
u∈V

sup

X∈{0,1}V

(cid:88)

c(u, X) < ∞,

(cid:101)cu(v) < ∞,

sup
u∈V

v(cid:54)=u

(2.8)

(2.9)

where

(cid:101)cu(v) := sup{(cid:107)c(u, X1) − c(u, X2)(cid:107)T : X1(w) = X2(w) for all w (cid:54)= v}

measures the dependence of the transition rate c(u, X) of the site v ∈ V and (cid:107) · (cid:107)T denotes
the total variation norm.
c(., .). Using these we obtain for any X ∈ {0, 1}V and u ∈ V

Both inequalities follow from Assumption 2.2 and the deﬁnition of the transition rates

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

c(u, X) ≤ (1 + α)

a(v, u) + γ

b(w, (v, u)) < ∞

showing (2.8). For (2.9), we note that(cid:101)cu(v) (cid:54)= 0 only when either a(v, u) > 0 or b(w, (v, u)) > 0

or b(v, (w, u)) > 0 for some w ∈ V . Hence, for all u ∈ V we obtain

v,w∈V

v∈V

(cid:33)

(cid:32)

(cid:88)

v(cid:54)=u

(cid:101)cu(v) ≤(cid:88)
≤(cid:88)

v(cid:54)=u

v∈V

(cid:88)
(cid:88)

w∈V

v,w∈V

(1 + α)a(v, u) + γ

(1 + α)a(v, u) + 2γ

b(w, (v, u)) + b(v, (w, u))

b(v, (w, u)) < ∞,

where we used the inequalities (2.1) and (2.2) again and we have proved (2.9).

Now, using [Lig85, Theorem 1.3.9] we see that the closure of Ω in C({0, 1}V ) is a Markov

generator of a Markov semigroup. This ﬁnishes the proof.

We can now deﬁne the voter model with bias and cooperation.

Deﬁnition 2.5 ((Cooperative/Altruistic) Voter Model with Bias and Cooperation). Let a(., .)
be a Markov kernel from V to V satisfying (2.1) and b(., (., .)) be a Markov kernel from V to
V × V satisfying (2.2).

1. The (unique) Markov process with transition rates given by (2.5) and (2.6) is called the

Voter Model with Bias and Cooperation (VMBC).

2. If (2.3) holds, the VMBC is called the altruistic Voter Model with Bias and Cooperation

(aVMBC).

3. If (2.4) holds, the VMBC is called the cooperative Voter Model with Bias and Cooper-

ation (cVMBC).

2.3 Unstructured populations

As a ﬁrst result, we show that cooperators always die out (for α > 0) if V is a large complete
graph. Here, we consider the special case of an unstructured population in the sense that
|V N| = N and

aN (u, v) =

1

N − 1

for u, v ∈ V N with u (cid:54)= v. Due to the global neighborhood it is equally likely to ﬁnd
conﬁgurations of the form ”101” and ”110”. Hence, cooperation events favoring a defector or
a cooperator happen with the same rate and thus cancel out when looking at the mean ﬁeld
behavior of the system. We will show that defectors always take over the system for large
N . It can easily be seen that the aVMBC is dominated by the cVMBC, so it suﬃces to show
extinction of cooperators for the cVMBC, i.e. we have

bN (u, (v, w)) =

1{u(cid:54)=v}
N − 1

1{v(cid:54)=w}1{w(cid:54)=u}
(N − 1) N−2
N−1

=

1

(N − 1)(N − 2)

1{u,v,w diﬀerent}.

We prove that in the limit for large N the frequency of cooperators follows a logistic equation
with negative drift, hence cooperators die out. See also [EK86, Chapter 11].

Proposition 2.6 (Convergence in the unstructured case). Let X N be a cVMBC on V N and
SN := 1
N

u X N (u) the frequency of cooperators. Then, if SN

====⇒ s0, then

(cid:80)

where S solves the ODE

SN N→∞

====⇒ S,

dS = −αS(1 − S)

with S0 = s0, independently of γ.
Proof. In order to prove the limiting behavior for N → ∞, we observe that SN is a Markov
process. A calculation of the generator ΩN applied to some smooth function f yields

3 Results: Long-time behavior for V = Zd
Our main goal is to derive the long-time behavior of the VMBC with V = Zd. In spin-ﬂip
systems, results on the ergodic behavior can be obtained by general principles if the process is

6

monotone. Thereby, a spin-system is called monotone if for two conﬁgurations X, Y ∈ {0, 1}V
with X ≤ Y componentwisely, the corresponding transition rates c satisfy the following two
relations for all u ∈ V

X(u) = Y (u) = 0 ⇒ c(u, X) ≤ c(u, Y ),
X(u) = Y (u) = 1 ⇒ c(u, X) ≥ c(u, Y ).

(3.1)

(3.2)

However, the VMBC is not monotone for γ > 0.
V = {u, v, w} with Markov kernels

Indeed, consider the simple case when

a(u, v) = a(v, w) = a(w, u) = 1

and b(u, (v, w)) = a(u, v)a(v, w). Then, let X = (001) and Y = (101) (i.e. X(u) = 0, Y (u) =
1, X(v) = Y (v) = 0, X(w) = Y (w) = 1) and note that X ≤ Y , but

c(w, X) = 1 + α < 1 + α + γ = c(w, Y ).

This shows that (3.2) is not satisﬁed at w ∈ V . Hence, proofs for the long-time behavior
require other strategies which do not rely on the monotonicity of the process.
Before we state our main results we deﬁne what we mean by extinction, survival and clustering.

Deﬁnition 3.1 (Extinction, Survival, Clustering).

1. We say that in the VMBC-process

(Xt)t≥0 type i ∈ {0, 1} dies out if

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
t→∞ Xt = 1 − i

lim

P

= 1,

where 0 and 1 are the all-zero (exclusively defectors) and all-one (exclusively cooperators)
conﬁgurations, respectively.

2. We say that type i ∈ {0, 1} survives, if for all u ∈ V

t→∞ P (Xt(u) = i) > 0.
lim inf
3. We say that the VMBC-process clusters if for all u, v ∈ V

t→∞ P (Xt(u) = Xt(v)) = 1.
lim

We will use V = Zd and nearest neighbor interaction via the kernels a and b. In this case we
have that for all u, v, w ∈ Zd with |u − v| = |w − v| = 1

for the aVMBC and

a(u, v) =

a(u, v) =

b(u, (v, w)) =

(2d)2

b(u, (v, w)) =

1

2d(2d − 1)

1{u(cid:54)=w}

for the cVMBC. Furthermore, we say that (the distribution of) a {0, 1}Zd-valued random
conﬁguration X is non-trivial if P (X = 0), P (X = 1) < 1. This implies that, with pos-
itive probability, X is not mono-typic. Furthermore, we call X translation invariant if

Figure 1: Relative frequencies of cooperators after 100.000 transitions of the cVMBC on a
1.000 sites torus in one dimension (dashed line), a 40× 40 sites torus in two dimensions (solid
line) and a 12× 12× 12 sites torus in three dimensions (dotted line). The initial conﬁguration
was a Bernoulli-product measure with probability 0.5 and the selection rate α was set to 0.5.

(X(u1), ..., X(un)) d= (X(u1 + v), ..., X(un + v)) for all n ∈ N, u1, ..., un, v ∈ Zd. If the VMBC
model is started in a translation invariant conﬁguration X0 ∈ {0, 1}Zd, the conﬁguration Xt
is translation invariant due to the homogeneous model dynamics.
Now, we can state our main results. For cVMBC, we distinguish between the case α > γ
where we can state a convergence result in all dimensions d ≥ 1, the case γ > α and the case
γ = α. In the last two cases, the method of proof is only applicable in dimension d = 1.
Theorem 1 (cVMBC-limits). Let V = Zd and a(., .) be the nearest neighbor random walk
kernel and X be the cVMBC with α, γ ≥ 0 starting in some non-trivial translation invariant
initial conﬁguration.

(i) If d ≥ 1 and α > γ, the cooperators die out.

(ii) If d = 1 and γ > α, the defectors die out.

(iii) If d = 1 and γ = α, the process clusters.

The proof of Theorem 1 can be found in Section 5.1. Brieﬂy, for α > γ, we will use a
comparison argument with a biased voter model, see Deﬁnition 4.1. For γ > α, however, we
prove the convergence result with the help of a clustersize-process which takes the special
form of a jump process in one dimension. In particular, this argument cannot be extended to
higher dimensions. Resorting to some simulation results for d = 2 and d = 3, we see a similar
behavior (with a diﬀerent threshold) like in d = 1, see Figure 1. For higher dimensions,
cooperators are less likely to cluster, leading to a reduced chance of survival.
The proof of the next Theorem on the aVMBC can be found in Section 5.2. Here, we can
only state a threshold when cooperators die out.
Theorem 2 (aVMBC-limits). Let V = Zd and a(., .) be the nearest neighbor random walk
kernel and X be the aVMBC with α, γ ≥ 0 starting in some non-trivial translation invariant
initial conﬁguration.

die out if α > 0 independently of γ.

d , the cooperators die out. In particular, for d = 1, the cooperators

2. If d = 1, the process equals the cVMBC with parameters α+γ/2 and γ/2 in distribution.

In particular, if γ > α = 0, the process clusters.

Remark 3.2 (Cooperation only among cooperators). Another cooperation mechanism we
might consider arises if cooperators only help other cooperators, i.e. the cells recognize related
cells. In ecological literature this behavior is called kin-recognition or kin-discrimination, see
[PF10] for an overview. As to the theoretical behavior of the model this changes the transition
rate in (2.6), i.e. if X(u) = 1 then

(cid:88)

c(u, X) = (1 + α)

a(v, u)(1 − X(v)).

v

Here, cooperators are less likely to die and hence, this process dominates the cVMBC. In
particular, for translation invariant initial conditions, defectors die out for γ > α in one
dimension. Moreover, as can be seen from a calculation similar as in the proof of Lemma 4.3,
a biased voter model, where type 0 is favored, still dominates this process for α > γ. Hence,
we also have that cooperators die out in this case and the same results as in Theorem 1 hold.

Since cooperators always die out in d = 1 for the aVMBC (as long as α > 0), we focus on
the cVMBC in the sequel. We state some results if the starting conﬁguration is not translation
invariant, but contains only a ﬁnite number of cooperators or defectors.
Theorem 3 (Finite initial conﬁgurations). Let V = Z and a(., .) be the nearest neighbor
random walk kernel and X be the cVMBC with α, γ ≥ 0. Let X0 contain either ﬁnitely many
defectors or ﬁnitely many cooperators (i.e. X0 = 1A or X0 = 1 − 1A for some ﬁnite A ⊆ V ).
(i) The process clusters.
(ii) If α ≥ γ and X0 contains ﬁnitely many cooperators, the cooperators die out.
(iii) If γ ≥ α and X0 contains ﬁnitely many defectors, the defectors die out.
Remark 3.3 (Starting with a single particle). A particularly simple initial condition is given
if |A| = 1. In case there is only a single cooperator, we note that the size of the cluster of
cooperators (Ct)t≥0 is a birth-death process which jumps from c to

c + 1 at rate 1{c>0} + γ · 1{c≥2},
c − 1 at rate (1 + α) · 1{c>0}.

Conversely, if there is only a single defector, the size of the cluster of defectors (Dt)t≥0 is a
birth-death process which jumps from d to

d + 1 at rate (1 + α) · 1{d>0} + γ · 1{d=1},
d − 1 at rate (1 + γ) · 1{d>0}.

Hence, either cooperators or defectors die out, depending on whether (Ct)t≥0 (or (Dt)t≥0)
hits 0 or not.

The proof of Theorem 3 is given in Section 5.3. Note, that the only situations where the
process does not converge to a deterministic conﬁguration in this setting are the cases where
γ > α (α > γ) and the process starts with ﬁnitely many cooperators (defectors). Here, the
limit distribution is a linear combination of the invariant measures δ0 and δ1 which basically
means that we observe clustering, which is statement (i) above.

4 Preliminaries

Here we provide some useful results for the proofs of our theorems. In particular, we provide
a comparison with a biased voter model in Section 4.1 and a particular jump process in
Section 4.2.

4.1 Comparison results

In cases where α > γ, it is possible to prove a stochastic domination of the VMBC by a biased
voter model. The precise statements will be given below. But ﬁrst, we deﬁne this process,
which was introduced by Williams and Bjerknes in [WB71] and ﬁrst studied by Bramson and
Griﬀeath in [BG81].
Deﬁnition 4.1 (Biased Voter Model). The biased voter model with bias β ≥ −1 and δ ≥ −1

is a spin system (cid:101)X with state space {0, 1}V and transition rates as follows:
If (cid:101)X(u) = 0, then

If (cid:101)X(u) = 1, then

(cid:101)c(u, (cid:101)X) = (1 + β)

(cid:101)c(u, (cid:101)X) = (1 + δ)

Remark 4.2 (Long-time behavior of the biased voter model). The long-time behavior of
the biased voter model is quite simple.
In [BG81], the limit behavior of the biased voter
model in V = Zd with nearest neighbor interactions is studied. Generalizations to the case
of d−regular trees for d ≥ 3 can be found in [LTV14]. We restate the results for V = Zd:
For any conﬁguration X0 ∈ {0, 1}Zd with inﬁnitely many zeros it holds that the type with
less bias dies out, i.e.:

4.2 A result on a jump process

In the proof of Theorem 1, we will use the dynamics of the size of a cluster of cooperators
and rely on a comparison of this clustersize process with a certain jump process (which jumps
downward by at most one and upwards by at most two). The following lemma will be needed.
Lemma 4.5 (A jump process). Let (Ct)t≥0 be a Z-valued jump process, which jumps from x
to

x − 1 at rate µ,
x + 1 at rate λ1,
x + 2 at rate λ2.

If λ1 + 2λ2 > µ, then Ct

t→∞−−−→ ∞ almost surely.

Proof. We assume without loss of generality that λ1 + λ2 + µ = 1. (Otherwise, use a time-
rescaling.)
We ﬁrst show that there exists an ac > 0 such that for all a ∈ (0, ac), the process
(exp(−aCt))t≥0 is a positive super-martingale. For this, consider the generator of the process
(Ct)t≥0 applied to the function f (x) = exp(−ax) which yields

(GCf )(x) = λ1 exp(−a(x + 1)) + λ2 exp(−a(x + 2)) + µ exp(−a(x − 1)) − exp(−ax)

= exp(−ax)(λ1 exp(−a) + λ2 exp(−2a) + µ exp(a) − 1).

(4.4)

We deﬁne g(x) := λ1 exp(−x) + λ2 exp(−2x) + µ exp(x) − 1. Noting that g(0) = 0 and
g(cid:48)(0) < 0 we ﬁnd ac > 0 such that ac := inf(a ∈ R>0 : g(a) = 0). This yields that for all
a ∈ (0, ac) we have that g(a) < 0 which means that (exp(−aCt))t≥0 is a super-martingale. By
the martingale convergence theorem, it converges almost surely and the only possible almost
t→∞−−−→ ∞ if and only if exp(−aCt) t→∞−−−→ 0 for
sure limit is 0. The result now follows since Ct
some a > 0.
Corollary 4.6 (C does not need to hit 1). Let (Ct)t≥0 be the Z-valued jump process from
above with C0 = 2 and T1 := inf{t : Ct = 1}. Then, P (T1 = ∞) > 0.
Proof. For some a > 0, the process (exp(−aCt∧T1))t≥0 is a non-negative supermartingale. Let
t→∞−−−→ 1 almost surely.
us assume that T1 < ∞ almost surely, which occurs if and only if Ct∧T1
Then we obtain with the dominated convergence theorem and C0 = 2

exp(−2a) = E[exp(−aC0)] ≥ lim

t→∞ E[exp(−aCt∧T1)] = E[ lim

t→∞ exp(−aCt∧T1)] = exp(−a),

a contradiction. Thus, we have that P (T1 = ∞) > 0.
Corollary 4.7 (Time-dependent jump rates). Let (µ(t))t≥0, (λ1(t))t≥0, (λ2(t))t≥0 be c`adl`ag-
stochastic processes which satisfy λ1(t) + 2λ2(t) − µ(t) > ε > 0 for some ε > 0. In addition,
let (Ct)t≥0 be a Z-valued jump process with C0 = 2, which jumps at time t from x to

x − 1 at rate µ(t),
x + 1 at rate λ1(t),
x + 2 at rate λ2(t)

and T1 := inf{t : Ct = 1}. Then, P (T1 = ∞) > 0.

12

Proof. By the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 4.5, we see that the process
(exp(−aCt))t≥0 is a non-negative supermartingale for a > 0 small enough which yields
t→∞−−−→ ∞ almost surely. Now, as in the proof of Corollary 4.6, the assertion then fol-
Ct
lows.

5 Proofs

Here, we will show our main results.

5.1 Proof of Theorem 1

For (i), we have α > γ. The assertion is a consequence of the coupling with the biased voter
model from Lemma 4.3 (with bias γ and α). Since the biased voter model dominates the
cVMBC and type 1 dies out in the biased voter model (4.2), the same is true for the cVMBC.
The proof of (ii) is more involved. We have to show that cooperators survive almost
surely when started in a non-trivial translation invariant conﬁguration. Therefore, we analyze
an arbitrary cluster of cooperators and show that the size of such a cluster has a positive
probability to diverge oﬀ to inﬁnity. Note that the ﬂanking regions of a cluster of cooperators
can have three diﬀerent forms:

Case A

001...1(cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125)

00,

Case B

101...1(cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125)

01,

cluster of cooperators

cluster of cooperators

001...1(cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125)

Case C

01 or 101...1(cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125)00

cluster of cooperators

(5.1)

These are the only possible environments a cluster of cooperators can encounter in one di-
mension. Note, that a cluster can also only consist of a single cooperator. The dynamics of
the cluster size depends on the environment. Precisely, by the dynamics of the process, we
obtain the following. A cluster of size x > 1

in case A jumps to y = x + 1 at rate 1 + γ
jumps to y = x − 1 at rate 1 + α

in case B jumps to y ≥ x + 2 at rate at least 2 + γ

jumps to y = x − 1 at rate 1 + α + γ

in case C jumps to y ≥ x + 2 at rate at least 1 + γ

2

(5.2)

jumps to y = x + 1 at rate 1+γ
2
jumps to y = x − 1 at rate 1 + α + γ
2 .

Under the assumptions of Theorem 1, let (Vt)t≥0 be the cluster of cooperators at time 0 which
is closest to the origin and contains at least two cooperators. (If there is no such cluster at
time 0, wait for some time ε > 0 and pick the cluster then.) We will show that

P (Vt ↑ Z) > 0.

For this, we compare |V | = (|Vt|)t≥0 with a jump process ((cid:101)Vt)t≥0 as in Corollary 4.7, where

λ1(t) = 1 + γ at times t when the cluster is in case A, λ1(t) = 0 and λ1(t) = 1+γ
2
and C. Moreover, λ2(t) = 0, 2+γ, 1+ γ

for cases B
2 for the three cases and µ(t) = 1+α, 1+α+γ, 1+α+ γ
2 ,

(5.3)

couple |V | and (cid:101)V such that (cid:101)V ≤ |V |, at least until (cid:101)V reaches 1. Since (cid:101)Vt
respectively, and stopped when reaching 1. By the comparison in (5.2), we see that we can
t→∞−−−→ ∞ with positive
probability, we ﬁnd that P (|Vt| t→∞−−−→ ∞) > 0 holds as well. Still, we need to make sure that
the cluster does not wander to ±∞. For this, consider both boundaries of the cluster if it has
grown to a large extent. The right boundary is again bounded from below by a jump process
of the form as in Corollary 4.7 with λ1(t) = 1+γ
2 , 1+α+γ
for the cases A and B (note that the right boundary alone of case C is already captured by
the right boundaries of the cases A and B). So, again, we see from Corollary 4.7 that the
right border of the cluster goes to inﬁnity with positive probability. The same holds for the
left border of the cluster which tends to −∞. Therefore, we have shown (5.3).

2 , 0; λ2(t) = 0, 1 + γ

2 and µ(t) = 1+α

2

Now, we use (5.3) and the fact that a cluster of cooperators can merge with ﬁnitely
many other clusters in ﬁnite time. To be more precise, if a cluster of cooperators goes
extinct at time T0 which happens with probability P (T0 < ∞) < 1 it fused only with ﬁnitely
other clusters which then go extinct as well. Due to the translation invariance of the initial
conﬁguration there are inﬁnitely many clusters of cooperators initially such that we can restart
this argument arbitrarily often. Since P (T0 = ∞) = P (Vt ↑ Z) > 0 one of these clusters almost
surely succeeds and expands to inﬁnity. Hence, we have P (limt→∞ Xt = 1) = 1 and we are
done. For (iii), in order to prove clustering in the case α = γ > 0, for i0, ..., ik ∈ {0, 1} and
k = 0, 1, 2, ... we write pt(i0 ··· ik) := P (Xt(0) = i0,··· Xt(k) = ik). We have to show that

pt(10) t→∞−−−→ 0,

pt(01) t→∞−−−→ 0

(5.4)

since then – by translation invariance – every conﬁguration carrying both types has vanishing
probability for t → ∞.

We start with the dynamics of pt(1), which reads (recall that α = γ)

∂pt(1)

2

(pt(10) + pt(01) − 2pt(010)) − γpt(101)

2

(pt(10) + pt(01)) − γpt(101)

Since pt(1) ∈ [0, 1], this probability has to converge for t → ∞, hence ∂pt(1)
therefore

∂t

pt(101) t→∞−−−→ 0,

pt(010) t→∞−−−→ 0.

t→∞−−−→ 0, and

(5.5)

Now, consider the dynamics of pt(11), which is

∂pt(11)

= pt(101) +

(pt(1101) + pt(1011))

(pt(110) + pt(011)) − γ
2

(pt(1011) + pt(1101))

(pt(110) + pt(011)).

= pt(101) − 1 + α

2

Since we know that pt(101) t→∞−−−→ 0 by (5.5), and because pt(11) ∈ [0, 1], we also have that

pt(110) t→∞−−−→ 0,

pt(011) t→∞−−−→ 0.

14

We now conclude with

pt(10) = pt(010) + pt(110) t→∞−−−→ 0,
pt(01) = pt(010) + pt(011) t→∞−−−→ 0,

which shows (5.4).

5.2 Proof of Theorem 2

(i) We use the comparison with the biased voter model from Lemma 4.4. Therefore, we have
that α > γ(d − 1)/d if and only if α + γ/(2d) > γ(2d − 1)/(2d). Since for this choice of
parameters type 1 goes extinct in the biased voter model which dominates the aVMBC, we
are done.
(ii) For d = 1 and the nearest neighbor random walk, the altruistic mechanism is such that
a conﬁguration 01 (or 10) turns into 00 at rate α/2 + γ/4. The same holds for the cVMBC
with bias α + γ/2. In addition, 110 (or 011) turns to 111 at rate γ/2, which is the same as for
the cVMBC with cooperation parameter γ. This shows the claim. In particular, clustering
follows from Theorem 1(iii).

5.3 Proof of Theorem 3

At time t, let Nt be the number of ﬁnite clusters in Xt with sizes C1
starts with ﬁnitely many defectors (cooperators), C1
tors (cooperators), and C2
(Nt, C1

. If the process
t , ... are sizes of clusters of defec-
t , ... are sizes of clusters of cooperators (defectors). Note that

t )t≥0 is a Markov process. We will show the following:

t , ..., CNt

t , C3

t , C5

t , C4

t , ..., CNt
t

1. Either, Nt

t→∞−−−→ 0 or Nt

2. In cases (ii) and (iii), Nt

3. If Nt

t→∞−−−→ 1, then C1

t

t→∞−−−→ 1.
t→∞−−−→ 0.
t→∞−−−→ ∞.

Note that 1. and 3. together imply (i), i.e. X clusters in all cases. Of course, 2. implies (ii)
and (iii).
1. The process N = (Nt)t≥0 is a non-increasing process, bounded from below by 0, so
convergence of N is certain. We assume that Nt = n ≥ 2 and prove that the hitting time
inf{s : Ns < n} is ﬁnite almost surely. For this, it suﬃces to show that
s = 1 for some 1 ≤ k ≤ Ns} < ∞

T := inf{s : Ck

(5.6)

almost surely, since by time T , some cluster has size 1 and there is a positive chance that
N decreases at the next transition. If N does not decrease, there is the next chance after
another ﬁnite time and eventually, N will decrease.
If α ≥ γ, consider the size Ct of a cluster of cooperators. Before time T , all clusters have

size at least 2, so Ct jumps

from c to c + 1 at rate 1 + γ,
from c to c − 1 at rate 1 + α,

15

2. If Nt

hence (Ct∧T )t≥0 is a non-negative supermartingale and converges almost surely, which implies
that T < ∞ almost surely. If γ ≥ α, the same argument shows that T < ∞ if the role of
cooperators and defectors is exchanged. Hence we have proved (5.6) and 1. is shown.
t→∞−−−→ 1 and α ≥ γ, the remaining ﬁnite cluster must contain defectors (since the
argument above shows that a ﬁnite cluster of cooperators would die out). Therefore, in (ii),
t→∞−−−→ 0. If γ ≥ α, the remaining ﬁnite cluster contains cooperators
we must have that Nt
t→∞−−−→ 0. Thus, we have shown 2.
for the same reason. Hence, in (iii), we must have that Nt
t→∞−−−→ 0 in
Moreover, if α = γ, both cases would hold, which is impossible and therefore, Nt
this case.
t→∞−−−→ 1 the remaining ﬁnite cluster must contain the stronger
type, i.e. defectors for α > γ and cooperators for γ > α. The size of the remaining ﬁnite
t→∞−−−→ 1} and the
cluster therefore is a biased random walk which goes to inﬁnity on {Nt
result follows.
