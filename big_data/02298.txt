Three reasonable hypotheses lead to the thesis that physical phenomena can be described and simu-
lated with cellular automata. In this work, we attempt to describe the motion of a particle upon which
a constant force is applied, with a cellular automaton, in Newtonian physics, in Special Relativity,
and in General Relativity. The results are very different for these three theories.

Introduction

Three reasonable hypotheses—homogeneity in time and space, bounded velocity of propagation of in-
formation, and bounded density of information—lead to the thesis that physical phenomena can be de-
scribed and simulated with cellular automata. This implication has in fact been formalized into a theorem
both in the classical [6] and the quantum case [1], albeit in ﬂat space.

Further evaluating this thesis leads to the project of selecting speciﬁc physical phenomena and at-
tempting to describe them with cellular automata. In this work, we consider a particle upon which a
constant force is applied—as induced by the ﬁrst order approximation of a gravitational ﬁeld. We do
so in three different settings: Newtonian physics, Special Relativity, and General Relativity. We seek
to capture each of these motions as a Cellular Automaton. The results are very different for these three
theories.

2 Motion in cellular automata

Recall that the conﬁgurations of a 1D cellular automaton are functions from Z to a ﬁnite set of states S
,
which includes a distinguished quiescent state q. The evolution of the cellular automaton is a function F
mapping conﬁgurations to conﬁgurations. It has to be causal and homogeneous, that is there must exist
a radius r and a local function f such that for all i, (F(d ))i = f (d i−r, ..., ,d i−1,d i,d i+1, ...,d i+r).
, and a discrete motion ˜y, that is a function from e N to
D Z. A conﬁguration d
if d k 6= q and for all i 6= k, d i = q.
A transition function F represents a discrete motion ˜y if there exists an initial conﬁguration d such that
for all k, F k(d ) represents a particle at ˜y(ke ). A standard reference on cellular automata for constructing
signals approximating different functions is [7].

is said to represent a particle at position kD

Consider a temporal step e , a spatial step D

In each of the following three sections we proceed by ﬁrst calculating the continuous motion y(t),
that is the position as a function of time. We then construct the cellular automata for ˜y, if it exists. The
differences between the three cases are highlighted.

Freefallandcellularautomata

3 Free fall in Newtonian physics

We begin with the standard case of Newtonian physics. The choice of units and notations will carry
through in the next sections. In Newtonian physics, the gravitational force applied by a body of mass M
upon a particle of mass M′ at a distance d is

F = G

MM′
d2

Multiplying both sides by G /c4, where c is the speed of light, introducing notations m = (G /c2)M which
is the mass of the body expressed in meters, m′ = (G /c2)M′ which is the mass of the particle expressed
in meters, and f = (G /c4)F which is the force expressed as a scalar without dimension, we get

f = m′

m
d2

Consider a particle whose initial distance to the body is R and initial velocity is zero and let y be such
that d = R− y, we have

f = m′

m

(R− y)2

To deﬁne free fall, we approximate this force by

that is, introducing the notation g = m/R2

f = m′

m
R2

f = m′g

(1)

(2)

For example, the mass of the Earth is M = 5.97 1024 kg, so m = (G /c2)M = 4.42 10−3 m. The radius of
the Earth is R = 6.37 106 m, so g = m/R2 = 1.09 10−16 m−1. Note that gc2 = 9.81 ms−2 as expected.

When such a constant force is acting on a particle of mass M′, its acceleration A is given the equation

M′A = F

Multiplying both sides with G /c4 and introducing the notation a = A/c2, which is the acceleration of the
particle expressed in m−1, we get

m′a = f = m′g

thus

from which we get

a = g

v = gt

(3)

where v = V /c is the velocity expressed as a scalar with no dimension and t = cT is time expressed in
meters, and

y =

gt2

2

Thus the spacetime trajectory of this particle is a parabola.

It is easy to prove that no cellular automaton can simulate such a motion: as the velocity of the
particle increases linearly with time, the difference between y at some time step and at the next time step
increases linearly with time. Thus, the evolution is not local. Moreover, to be able to compute y at the
next time step from y at some time step, we need to know the velocity of the particle and it is then natural
to express this velocity as part of the state of the cell. But then, as velocity is not bounded, the state space
cannot be kept ﬁnite, even if velocity is deﬁned with a ﬁnite precision.

4 Constant force in Special Relativity

In Special Relativity, neither of these problems occurs: velocity is bounded, hence the evolution is local.
And if the velocity is known with a ﬁnite precision, a ﬁnite state space sufﬁces. Still, another worry
remains. If the velocity at some time step is computed from the velocity at the previous one, and both
velocities are approximate, errors can accumulate. As we shall see, it is possible to circumvent this
problem, and have a non divergent discretization of the trajectory of the particle.

In Special Relativity, the proper acceleration [8] of a particle is

We assume that the force is as in Newtonian physics: m′a = f = m′g, so a = g, that is

In the same way, we have

as expected.

Note that the velocity w = sinh(gt ) goes to inﬁnity when t does. But the mapping from coordinate

time to proper time t = (1/g)arsinh(gt) slows down in such a way that the velocity v = gt/p1 + (gt)2

remains bounded by 1. Hence the particle never goes faster than light.

The spacetime trajectory of the particle is a branch of the hyperbola of equation

(gy + 1)2 − (gt)2 = 1

Thus, in Special Relativity, the spacetime trajectory of a particle upon which a constant force is applied is
not a branch of a parabola, but a branch of an hyperbola and the problem of modeling the motion of such
a particle, with a cellular automaton, boils down to that of the approximability of a branch of hyperbola.

, so this equation can be numerically solved.

For example, if g = 1.09 10−16 m−1 and r = 1.6 10−35 m, this equation boils down to

D ≥ 5.11 10−33 m = 320r

Indeed, if we take D = 320r , a cell can encode 320 bits and l = 1.54 1096 = 2320.

So, with an accuracy of the order of magnitude of 10−33 m, constant force in Special Relativity does

not require a particle to contain more than a few hundred bits.

the metric tensor

“Constant force due to free fall” would make for a non-standard concept in General Relativity. On the
one hand, a constant force of non-gravitational origin could indeed be applied in ﬂat space and lead to the
exact same computations as Special Relativity. On the other hand, free-falling could just mean following

a geodesic trajectory in some more or less complicated metric—although not in a constant one. Indeed,
making gtt constant as in the approximation of Equation (1) into (2) becomes an over-approximation,
as the geodesics then become linear. So, we deﬁne this “ﬁrst order approximated free fall” as the ﬁrst
non-trivial approximation of the metric tensor, that is we take a linear approximation of gtt as

gtt = 1−

where g = m/R2 is the acceleration of gravity, as before. Introducing y1 = (1− (2m/R))/2g we get

In the same way, we approximate dgtt /dy = −2m/(R− y)2 by −2m/R2 = −2g.

The equations of motion then become

that of Special Relativity, that is Equation (7), in the ﬂat spacetime case when gtt = 1. But the equation
of motion, that is Equation (9), coincides not with Special Relativity, that is Equation (6), but with
Newtonian physics, that is (3).

when t goes to inﬁnity, t has a ﬁnite limitp2y1/g. Thus, an inﬁnite amount of coordinate time corre-

sponds to a ﬁnite amount of proper time. As a consequence, with respect to coordinate time, after an
acceleration phase, the particle decelerates and has a limit position y1.

The distance to the limit at time t is

y1 − y = y1(1− (tanh(gt))2)

As expected, y1 − y decreases and goes to 0 when t goes to inﬁnity. Moreover, if working with a space

This function is monotonic in D
, so this equation can be numerically solved. For example, if m =
4.42 10−3 m, R = 6.37 106 m, and r = 1.6 10−35 m, we get g = 1.09 10−16 m−1 and y1 = 4.57 1015 m.
This equation boils down to

D ≥ 2.69 10−33 m = 168r

Indeed, if we take D = 168r , a cell can encode 168 bits and l = 1.92 1050 = 2168.

So, with an accuracy of the order of magnitude of 10−33 m, General Relativity also does not require

a free falling particle to contain more than a few hundred bits.

6 Conclusion

Newtonian physics and Relativity completely differ with respect to the possibility modelling free fall
within a cellular automaton. Such a simulation is not possible for Newtonian physics, while it is pos-
sible both in Special—constant force—and General Relativity—geodesics in a linearly approximated
metric. The simulation can be very accurate with a reasonable number of internal states: a few hundred
bits sufﬁce to achieve an accuracy of the order of magnitude of 10−33 m. So, as far as free fall is con-
cerned, Relativity is completely consistent with the hypotheses of a bounded velocity of propagation of
information and of a bounded density of information, unlike Newtonian physics.

In this work, we made explicit these accurate cellular automata, by exploiting the asymptotes to the
trajectory, that exist both in Special and General Relativity. There was no need to use auxiliary signals as
in [7]. We have proved the existence of such cellular automata, but made no attempt to design “natural”
ones: the local rules use the solutions of the equations of motion in order to know whether the particle
should move, or not. Moreover, there was clearly no attention paid to covariance. The design of more
natural automata is of course of prime importance. In the case of General Relativity for instance, the
metric at each point ought to be carried by the corresponding cell: we began to address this question both
in the classical case [2], and, building upon [4], in the quantum case [3].
