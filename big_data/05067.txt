We use a radio-frequency 85Rb alkali-vapor cell magnetometer based on a paraﬃn-coated cell
with long spin-coherence time and a small, low-inductance driving coil to create highly resolved
conductivity maps of diﬀerent objects. We resolve sub-mm features in conductive objects, we
characterize the frequency response of our technique, and by operating at frequencies up to 250 kHz
we are able to discriminate between diﬀerently conductive materials based on the induced response.
The method is suited to cover a wide range of driving frequencies and can potentially be used for
detecting non-metallic objects with low DC conductivity.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic induction measurements have many appli-
cations in defense, environmental surveying, and in the
process and quality control industry [1–3]. The work-
ing principle is simple: an oscillating or pulsed mag-
netic ﬁeld induces eddy currents in conductive objects
and these currents produce a magnetic response that is
measured in turn. The speciﬁcs of this response depend
on intrinsic material properties. The penetration, or skin
depth, of the modulated magnetic ﬁeld is a function of
the conductivity and permeability of the object and the
applied frequency. It has recently been shown that eddy
current detection is capable of imaging through metal-
lic enclosures by varying the applied drive frequency and
therefore the skin depth [4]. The relevance of this in a
security context has been pointed out in [5]. The cited
works and the majority of commercially available detec-
tors for industry use make use of coils as sensors. Eddy
current sensors based on giant magnetoresistance (GMR)
magnetometer [6, 7] and super-conducting quantum in-
terference devices (SQUIDs) [8–10] have also been imple-
mented.

Atomic magnetometers [11] can reach detection sen-
sitivities approaching SQUID based sensors without the
need for a cryogenic environment and they can be minia-
turized for applications requiring compact sensors [12].
The use of atomic magnetometers is beneﬁcial for low and
high driving frequencies. At low frequencies, and there-
fore large skin depth, atomic magnetometers are orders
of magnitude more sensitive to oscillating magnetic ﬁelds
than coil or GMR based sensors. The same image qual-

ity can therefore be produced with lower applied radio-
frequency (rf) power or images can be acquired through
thicker-walled conductive enclosures. The sensitivity of
atomic magnetometers at high frequencies changes little.
This allows for biological and bio-medical applications,
e.g. creating maps of the saline concentration in biologi-
cal tissue [13] or non-contact measurements of the human
heart rate [14]. Furthermore, the ability to create images
with the same sensor over a wide range of detection fre-
quencies is beneﬁcial [15] for the sensitive discrimination
of diﬀerent materials, as demonstrated in this letter.

In [16] an all-optical atomic magnetometer in self-
oscillating mode [17] was used to demonstrate the appli-
cation of atomic magnetometers for magnetic induction
measurements. This technique was then used to create
magnetic induction tomographic (MIT) maps of diﬀerent
metallic objects [18]. However, this self-oscillating mag-
netometer had inherent bandwidth limitations and was
less practical because the signal had to be demodulated
at the Larmor frequency of the atoms to gain access to
the eddy current response. Recently, an atomic magne-
tometer was used to partially overcome these issues and
demonstrate operation at frequencies up to 10 kHz [19].
In this work we use an all-optical atomic magnetome-
ter based on 85Rb that is directly sensitive to the phase
and amplitude of a radio-frequency magnetic ﬁeld that
is resonant with the Larmor precession of 85Rb atoms in
a static magnetic ﬁeld. The Larmor frequency can be
selected by tuning the static magnetic ﬁeld at the posi-
tion of the vapor cell. We are able to create images using
eﬀectively arbitrary radio frequencies with this method
and present images acquired with up to a 250 kHz drive-
frequency. This is a factor 25 higher than in [18, 19]
and limited only by the frequency range of the read-out
electronics.

to perform spatially resolved eddy-current measurements
and present the results for a selection of diﬀerent sam-
ple geometries. These include the image of a conductive
ring with a 1 mm slit as an example relevant to crack
detection. Finally, we present data of the eddy-current
response as a function of the driving frequency for diﬀer-
ent metals. The latter enables clear material discrimina-
tion and demonstrates a promising application of radio-
frequency alkali-vapor cell magnetometers.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A schematic of the experimental setup is shown in
Fig. 1. At its heart is an evacuated cylindrical paraﬃn-
coated cell with a lockable sidearm (stem) loaded with
85Rb . The cell’s outer diameter and length are 25 mm
and it is centered in a four-layer magnetic shield with
three outer layers constructed of mu-metal and the in-
nermost layer of ferrite (Twinleaf MS-1F). The shield is
left open to one side to enable access to the sample.

A circularly polarized laser beam resonant with the

85Rb D1 line, (Toptica TA Pro, 794 nm, 600 mW, (cid:31) ≈

5 mm) produces atomic spin polarization along the pump
beam propagation axis. The unusually large amount of
laser power is used to broaden the magnetic resonance,
and therefore reduce the sensitivity to transient magnetic
ﬁeld changes caused by activity in the lab. The laser is
frequency stabilized to the D1 85Rb F = 2 → F (cid:48) = 3
transition with a Doppler-free dichroic atomic vapor laser
lock setup (DF-DAVLL) [20–22].

A Helmholtz coil pair creates a static magnetic ﬁeld
along the pump beam axis. The magnitude of the ﬁeld is
adjustable between 0 and 0.54 G, corresponding to Lar-
mor frequencies up to 250 kHz [23, 24]. The current
source for the magnetic ﬁeld is comprised by two laser
diode current drivers (Thorlabs ITC 502) connected in
parallel and controlled via their modulation inputs. The
modulation input is supplied by a GPIB-controlled volt-
age source (Krohn-Hite Model 523).

An oscillating magnetic ﬁeld at the Larmor frequency
causes the spins to precess about the leading ﬁeld axis.
The resulting spin precession is read out via the polar-
ization rotation of a linear polarized probe laser beam

[25] (Toptica DL Pro, 780 nm, 20 mW, (cid:31) ≈ 5 mm). A

small fraction of the probe beam is passed twice through
a 350 MHz acousto-optical modulator (AOM) for the
probe-laser frequency stabilization. This component of
the beam is, as a result, 700 MHz lower in frequency and
then used to generate a DF-DAVLL error signal with a
separate, uncoated vapor cell. The laser is locked to the
D2 resulting F = 3 → F (cid:48) = 3, 4 crossover feature in
this cell so that the probe’s laser light is approximately
+640 MHz higher in frequency than the F = 3 → F (cid:48) = 4
transition.

The probe beam traverses the cell orthogonal to the
pump beam and its polarization change is measured by

FIG. 1. Schematic of the experimental setup. The magne-
tometer consists of a cylindrical paraﬃn-coated, evacuated
vapor cell housed in a cylindrical 4-layer magnetic shield
open at one end. A variable magnetic ﬁeld is applied in y-
direction. The circularly polarized pump beam is locked via a
DF-DAVLL to the D1 F = 2 → F (cid:48) = 3 transition of 85Rb and
propagating parallel to the leading magnetic ﬁeld. It prepares
the atoms in the cell in the F = 3, mF = 3 eigenstate. Spin
precession is driven by applying an oscillating ﬁeld at the Lar-
mor frequency ωL with a small coil oriented in the z-direction
and mounted in the plane spanned by the pump and the probe
beam. It is shifted 5 cm in the y-direction from the cell center
so that the return ﬂux of the driving coil points predominantly
along the z-direction in the cell. The linearly polarized probe
beam propagates along the x-direction through the cell cen-
ter. A small fraction of the probe light is passed twice through
a 350 MHz AOM and then used in a DF-DAVLL to lock the
laser to the D2 F = 3 → F (cid:48) = 3, 4 crossover feature. The
probe beam polarization oscillation is detected with a bal-
anced polarimeter which is read out by a computer controlled
dual-phase lock-in ampliﬁer (LIA). The sample is mounted
on a 15 cm long plastic extension which is attached to a 3D
translation stage and moved with respect to the driving coil.

a balanced polarimeter comprised of a polarizing beam-
splitter cube and a balanced photodetector. (Thorlabs
PDB210A). The oscillating signal is analyzed with a lock-
in ampliﬁer (Signal Recovery 7265). The lock-in ampliﬁer
frequency range of 250 kHz is the limiting factor for the
frequencies used in this experiment.

The rf driving coil is a custom-made, ﬁve-turn solenoid
with an inner diameter of 0.5 mm and a copper wire thick-
ness of 0.2 mm. The calculated inductance of the coil is
on the order of a few nH and the coil behaves primarily
as a resistive load within the frequency range reported

mor frequency. At each frequency the amplitude and the
phase of the oscillating polarization signal is recorded
via the lock-in ampliﬁer. The resulting data in Fig. 2a)
show the Lorentzian-shaped magnetic resonances for sev-
eral diﬀerent ﬁelds. The measured Larmor frequencies,
ωL, the amplitudes and the widths of the resonances can
be extracted from nonlinear least-squares ﬁts using the
predicted lineshapes. The amplitudes and widths of the
MR are displayed in Fig. 2b) and c) respectively. The re-
duction in amplitude can be attributed to two technical
features. First, the gain of the ampliﬁer reduces start-
ing around 100 kHz, so the actual applied rf ﬁeld am-
plitude decreases with frequency. Second, the magnetic
resonance increases in width mostly due to magnetic ﬁeld
gradients within the cell volume, which are a function of
the leading ﬁeld strength. This increase in resonance
width reduces the amplitude further. These limitations
can be lifted by using an ampliﬁer optimized for higher
frequencies and by applying compensation gradients, re-
spectively.

The experimental procedure for acquiring eddy-current
images is as follows: First, a sample is placed on a
non-conductive mount that is attached to a three-axis
computer-controlled translation stage and positioned
away from the driving coil. Second, the rf is tuned to
the center of the magnetic resonance feature for a given
leading magnetic ﬁeld and the lock-in reference phase is
set to zero when there is no material. Finally, the sample
is moved with the translation stage. At each position of
a scan, the phase and amplitude of the lock-in signal is
recorded together with the coordinates of the translation
stage.

III. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

As a demonstration, Fig. 3 shows images of selected
conductive objects at 80 and 150 kHz. All the images
show sub-mm resolution and high contrast in the ampli-
tude and phase of the detected rf signal (raw data). The
images are displayed in grey scale to avoid misinterpreta-
tion of the objects borders due to false coloring. Figure
3a) shows three diﬀerent materials imaged in the same
scan. The contrast of the phase and amplitude plots is
material-dependent, which will be discussed in more de-
tail below. Fig. 3b) shows an image of a copper ring
featuring a 1 mm cut to provide an example relevant to
the important industrial application of crack detection.
And Fig. 3c) present a copper square placed at an angle
to the scan axis, to demonstrate orientation-independent
sub-mm features.

In a second experiment we wanted to demonstrate how
the broad frequency range can be used to discriminate
diﬀerent objects according to their conductivity. We
study a set of samples made of diﬀerent metals. These
were 4 × 4 × 0.5 mm3 samples of copper, aluminum, tita-
nium, and cupronickel, a copper-nickel compound. The
metals were chosen due to their range of conductivities

sponse. c) Width of the resulting Lorenzian line shapes. The
amplitude of the magnetic resonance goes down for two rea-
sons: the applied voltage over the coil is kept constant and

the background ﬁeld.

here. It is positioned in the plane spanned by the pump
and probe beams, roughly 5 cm away from the cell center
along the static magnetic ﬁeld axis. The orientation of
the solenoid axis is perpendicular to the pump and probe
beam.
It is supplied with an oscillating current via a
20 cm rigid coaxial conductor pair. The outer conductor
is a 5 mm diameter hollow aluminium pipe with 0.5 mm
wall thickness to prevent the emission of spurious rf from
the current leads. The current is driven by the ampli-
ﬁed output of a computer controlled function generator
(SRS DS335, ampliﬁer AE Techron 7224-P). An applied
signal at 10 kHz with amplitude 1 Vpp creates an oscil-
lating magnetic ﬁeld with approximately 5 G amplitude
just below the solenoid. The calibration for frequencies
up to 10 kHz was done with a commercial gaussmeter.
The oscillating return ﬂux of the solenoid is detected by
the magnetometer if the driving frequency matches the
Larmor frequency of the atoms in the cell.

In order to demonstrate the magnetometer’s capacity
to operate at diﬀerent radio-frequencies, we performed
measurements of the magnetic resonance (MR) for dif-
ferent static magnetic ﬁelds. Figure 2 shows a selection
of forced-oscillation scans and their analysis. In a forced-
oscillation scan, the static-ﬁeld current is set to a given
value and the driving frequency is scanned over the Lar-

lack of magnetization to avoid interference with the mag-
netometer. A photograph of the sample holder is shown
in Fig. 4a). A magnetic induction image was taken of
the four samples at a driving frequency of 245 kHz, with
200 µm step sizes and a lock-in time constant of 100 ms.
The resulting images created from the measured lock-in
values can be seen in Fig. 4b) and c). All the squares
are visible in the phase and amplitude data with sub-
millimeter resolution.

As a ﬁnal experiment we performed a frequency scan
at ﬁxed points to discriminate the diﬀerent materials.
To understand the resulting data, we brieﬂy review how
the induced magnetic ﬁeld is extracted from the lock-in
data. The signal due to the oscillating magnetic ﬁeld,
M (t), measured at the position of the vapor cell has two
components: one from the driving ﬁeld (and potentially
leaking ﬁelds from the wires delivering the current to the
driving coil) A (t) = A0 sin (ωt) and another component
due to the induced eddy currents IEC (t). In the quasi-
static approximation the induced magnetic ﬁeld compo-
nent is proportional to and in-phase with the oscillating
eddy current B (t) ∝ IEC (t) (see for example [26]).The
signal detected with the lock-in ampliﬁer can thus be
written as
MM sin (ωt + ψM ) = A0 sin (ωt) + B0 cos (ωt − φ) , (1)
where MM and ψM are the measured lock-in amplitude
and the phase, respectively. The lock-in phase is ze-
roed (ψM = 0) when there is no material (position 5
in Fig. 4a). In the absence of material the measured am-
plitude is just the amplitude of the driving ﬁeld at the

For each point in Fig. 4d) the magnetic ﬁeld was set
via GPIB and a forced oscillation scan was performed.
The resulting data were ﬁt with a Lorentzian to deter-
mine the Larmor frequency. The frequency of the drive
was set to the Larmor frequency and the lock-in phase
zeroed. Four points on top of the diﬀerent materials (po-
sition 1-4) were measured and ﬁve points at positions
without material (summarized as position 5 in Fig. 4a).
The mean of the ﬁve points without material were used
to determine A0. In total, magnetic induction measure-
ments were performed for 87 diﬀerent frequencies rang-
ing from 7 kHz to 243 kHz with an average step size of
2.75 kHz.

The amplitude of the signal due to the response ﬁeld,
B0, and the phase lag φ as a function of the frequency can
be seen in Fig. 4d). All data were normalized with A0
and the phases were shifted by the same constant for all
the data points such that all phase curves pass through
the origin.

All the metals are clearly distinguishable. The re-
sponse ﬁeld amplitude and the phase φ increase linearly
for low frequencies with a slope related to the conductiv-
ity. At high frequencies, the two metals with the high-
est conductivity (copper and aluminum) saturate, which
could be explained by skin depth eﬀects and can actu-
ally be used to measure the thickness of the material
[15]. The data are well-approximated by an exponential
function, and this behavior has been conﬁrmed by ﬁne-
element models. The skin-depths calculated from the
decay-constant frequencies and known conductivities ap-
proximately correspond to the materials’ thickness, how-
ever the exact quantitative relationship between these is
the topic of future work.

IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

We have presented sub-mm resolution eddy current im-
ages with an atomic radio-frequency magnetometer for
diﬀerent frequencies and materials with diﬀerent conduc-
tivities. In a ﬁrst set of measurements we demonstrated
the feasibility of the device to detect amplitude and phase
of ﬁelds from induced eddy currents for frequencies be-
tween 7-250 kHz, which is technically limited only by the
frequency range of the lock-in ampliﬁer and not by the
atomic sensor. Extending the operating frequency into
the MHz range is a straightforward technical improve-
ment that can open the possibility for biological applica-
tions.

with an exponential function. This scaling could be reproduced with ﬁnite-element simulations.

In a second set of measurements we demonstrate how
the frequency scanning capacity of the alkali-based rf
magnetometer can be used to discriminate diﬀerent ma-
terials with varying conductivity. Eddy current detection
is commercially widely used but mostly done with detec-
tion coils, but also with giant magnetoresistance (GMR)
based magnetic ﬁeld sensors and super-conducting quan-
tum interference devices. We add alkali-based rf mag-
netometer to the spectrum which might have substantial
beneﬁts for low-frequency and therefore high-penetration

depth eddy-current detection, due to their much higher
sensitivity than rf coils and their miniaturization ca-
pacity. Another extension of this method currently be-
ing pursued involves replacing the magnetometer in this
setup with one based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in di-
amond. This would be beneﬁcial for spatial resolution,
scalability and eddy-current detection in the GHz range.
