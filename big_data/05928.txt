MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

JONATHAN BRUNDAN AND ALEXANDER ELLIS

Abstract. This work is a companion to our article “Super Kac-Moody 2-
categories,” which introduces super analogs of the Kac-Moody 2-categories
of Khovanov-Lauda and Rouquier. In the case of sl2, the super Kac-Moody
2-category was constructed already in [A. Ellis and A. Lauda, “An odd cate-
goriﬁcation of Uq(sl2)”], but we found that the formalism adopted there be-
came too cumbersome in the general case. Instead, it is better to work with
2-supercategories (roughly, 2-categories enriched in vector superspaces). Then
the Ellis-Lauda 2-category, which we call here a Π-2-category (roughly, a 2-
category equipped with a distinguished involution in its Drinfeld center), can
be recovered by taking the superadditive envelope then passing to the under-
lying 2-category. The main goal of this article is to develop this language and
the related formal constructions, in the hope that these foundations may prove
useful in other contexts.

1. Introduction

1.1. In representation theory, one ﬁnds many monoidal categories and 2-categories
playing an increasingly prominent role. Examples include the Brauer category B(δ),
the oriented Brauer category OB(δ), the Temperley-Lieb category T L(δ), the web
category Web(Uq(sln)), the category of Soergel bimodules S(W ) associated to a
Coxeter group W , and the Kac-Moody 2-category U(g) associated to a Kac-Moody
algebra g. Each of these categories, or perhaps its additive Karoubi envelope, has
a deﬁnition “in nature,” as well as a diagrammatic description by generators and
relations. It is also often instructive after taking additive Karoubi envelope to pass
to the Grothendieck ring. Let us go through our examples in turn.

• The Brauer category B(δ) is the symmetric monoidal category generated
by a self-dual object of dimension δ ∈ C. By [LZ, Theorem 2.6], it may
be presented as the strict monoidal category with one generating object ·
: 1 → · ⊗ · and
and three generating morphisms

: · ⊗ · → · ⊗ · ,

: · ⊗ · → 1, subject to the following relations:

Here, we are using the well-known string calculus for morphisms in a strict
monoidal category as in [BK]. We remark also that the additive Karoubi
envelope of B(δ) is Deligne’s interpolating category REP(Oδ). There is a

similar story for the oriented Brauer category. It is the symmetric monoidal
category generated by a dual pair of objects of dimension δ. An explicit
presentation is recorded in [BCNR, Theorem 1.1].
Its additive Karoubi
envelope is Deligne’s interpolating category REP(GLδ).

• For δ = −(q + q−1) ∈ Q(q), the additive Karoubi envelope of T L(δ) is
monoidally equivalent to the category of ﬁnite-dimensional representations
of the quantum group Uq(sl2). More generally, for n ≥ 2, the additive
Karoubi envelope of Web(Uq(sln)) is monoidally equivalent to the category
of ﬁnite-dimensional representations of Uq(sln). An explicit diagrammatic
presentation was derived by Cautis, Kamnitzer and Morrison [CKM], build-
ing on the inﬂuential work of Kuperberg [K] which treated the case n = 3.
• When W is a Weyl group, Soergel [S] showed that S(W ) is monoidally
equivalent to the Hecke category H(G/B) of Kazhdan-Lusztig (certain B-
equivariant sheaves on the associated Lie group G). In general, S(W ) is
the additive Karoubi envelope of the category of Bott-Samelson bimodules.
In almost all cases, a diagrammatic presentation of the latter monoidal cat-
egory has been derived by Elias and Williamson [EW1]. The Grothendieck
ring K0(S(W )) is isomorphic to the group ring of W ; if one incorporates
the natural grading into the picture one actually gets the Iwahori-Hecke
algebra Hq(W ) associated to W .

• The Kac-Moody 2-category U(g) was deﬁned by generators and relations
by Rouquier [R] and Khovanov-Lauda [KL]; see also [B]. The Grothendieck
ring of its additive Karoubi envelope is naturally an idempotented ring, with
idempotents indexed by the underlying weight lattice, and is isomorphic to
the idempotented integral form ˙U (g) of the universal enveloping algebra of
g; if one incorporates the grading one gets Lusztig’s idempotented integral
form ˙Uq(g) of the associated quantum group. (These statements are still
only conjectural outside of ﬁnite type.)

1.2. We are interested in this article in superalgebra, i.e. Z/2-graded algebra. Our
motivation comes from the belief that there should be interesting super analogs of
all of the categories just mentioned. In fact, they are already known in several cases.
For example, analogs of the Brauer and oriented Brauer categories are suggested
by [KT] and [JK], respectively. Also in [BE], we have deﬁned a super analog of the
Kac-Moody 2-category, building on [EL] which treated the case of sl2. In thinking
about such questions, one quickly runs into some basic foundational issues. To
start with, already in the literature, there are several competing notions as to what
should be called a “super monoidal category.” The goal of the paper is to clarify
these notions and the connections between them.

Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic diﬀerent from 2. A superspace is a Z/2-graded
vector space V = V¯0 ⊕ V¯1. We use the notation |v| for the parity of a homogeneous
vector v in a superspace. Formulae involving this notation for inhomogeneous v
should be interpreted by extending additively from the homogeneous case.

Let SVec (resp. SVecf d) be the category of all superspaces (resp. ﬁnite dimen-
sional superspaces) and (not necessarily homogeneous) linear maps. These catego-
ries possess some additional structure:

• A linear map between superspaces V and W is even (resp. odd) if it preserves
(resp. reverses) the parity of vectors. Moreover, any linear map f : V → W

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

decomposes uniquely as a sum f = f¯0 + f¯1 with f¯0 even and f¯1 odd. This
makes each morphism space HomSVec(V, W ) into a superspace.

• The usual k-linear tensor product of two superspaces is again a superspace
with (V ⊗ W )¯0 = V¯0 ⊗ W¯0 ⊕ V¯1 ⊗ W¯1 and (V ⊗ W )¯1 = V¯0 ⊗ W¯1 ⊕ V¯1 ⊗ W¯0.
Also the tensor product f ⊗ g of two linear maps is the linear map deﬁned
from (f ⊗ g)(v ⊗ w) := (−1)|g||v|f (v) ⊗ g(w).

Let SVec be the subcategory of SVec consisting of all superspaces but only the
even linear maps. The restriction of the tensor product operation just deﬁned gives
a functor − ⊗ − : SVec × SVec → SVec making SVec into a monoidal category.
However, SVec itself is not monoidal in the usual sense, because of the sign in the
following formula for composing tensor products of linear maps:
(f ⊗ g) ◦ (h ⊗ k) = (−1)|g||h|(f ◦ h) ⊗ (g ◦ k).

(1.1)

In fact, SVec is what we’ll call a monoidal supercategory. We proceed to the formal
deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 1.1. (i) A supercategory means a SVec-enriched category, i.e. each
morphism space is a superspace and composition induces an even linear map. (We
refer to [K, §1.2] for the basic language of enriched categories.)

(ii) A superfunctor F : A → B between supercategories is a SVec-enriched
functor, i.e. the function HomA(λ, µ) → HomB(F λ, F µ), f 7→ F f is an even linear
map for all λ, µ ∈ ob A. (See [K, §1.2] again.)

(iii) Given superfunctors F, G : A → B, a supernatural transformation x : F ⇒ G
is a family of morphisms xλ = xλ,¯0 + xλ,¯1 ∈ HomB(F λ, Gλ) for λ ∈ ob A, such that
|xλ,p| = p and xµ,p ◦ F f = (−1)p|f |Gf ◦ xλ,p for all p ∈ Z/2 and f ∈ HomA(λ, µ).
The supernatural transformation x decomposes as a sum of homogeneous super-
natural transformations as x = x¯0 + x¯1 where (xp)λ := xλ,p, making the space
Hom(F, G) of all supernatural transformations from F to G into a superspace.
(Even supernatural transformations are just the same as the SVec-enriched natu-
ral transformations of [K, §1.2].)

(iv) A superfunctor F : A → B is a superequivalence if there is a superfunctor
G : B → A such that F ◦ G and G ◦ F are isomorphic to identities via even
supernatural transformations. To check that F is a superequivalence, it suﬃces to
show that it is full, faithful, and evenly dense, i.e. every object of B should be
isomorphic to an object in the image of F via an even isomorphism.

(v) For any supercategory A, the underlying category A is the category with
the same objects as but only the even morphisms from A.
If F : A → B is
a superfunctor between supercategories, it restricts to F : A → B. Also an even
supernatural transformation x : F ⇒ G is the same data as a natural transformation
x : F ⇒ G. (These deﬁnitions are special cases of ones in [K, §1.3].)

Example 1.2. (i) We’ve already explained how to make SVec into a supercategory.
The underlying category is SVec.

(ii) A superalgebra is a superspace A = A¯0 ⊕ A¯1 equipped with an even linear
map mA : A ⊗ A → A making A into an associative, unital algebra; we denote the
image of a ⊗ b under this map simply by ab. Any superalgebra A can be viewed as
a supercategory A with one object whose endomorphism superalgebra is A.

(iii) Suppose we are given superalgebras A and B. Then there is a supercategory
A-SMod-B consisting of all (A, B)-superbimodules and superbimodule homomor-
pisms. Here, an (A, B)-superbimodule is a superspace V plus an even linear map

4

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

mV : A ⊗ V ⊗ B → V making V into an (A, B)-bimodule in the usual sense; we
denote the image of a ⊗ v ⊗ b under this map simply by avb. A superbimodule
homomorphism f : V → W is a linear map such that mW ◦ (1A ⊗ f ⊗ 1B) = f ◦ mV .
In view of the deﬁnition of tensor product of linear maps between superspaces, this
means explicitly that f (avb) = (−1)|f ||a|af (v)b.

(iv) For any two supercategories A and B, there is a supercategory Hom(A, B)

consisting of all superfunctors and supernatural transformations.

The monoidal category SVec is symmetric with braiding u ⊗ v 7→ (−1)|u||v|v ⊗ u.
As in [K, §1.4], this allows us to introduce a product operation − ⊠ − which makes
the category SCat of all supercategories and superfunctors into a monoidal category.
On objects (i.e.
supercategories) A and B, this operation is deﬁned by letting
A ⊠ B be the supercategory whose objects are ordered pairs (λ, µ) of objects of
A and B, respectively, and HomA⊠B((λ, µ), (σ, τ )) := HomA(λ, σ) ⊗ HomB(µ, τ ).
Composition in A ⊠ B is deﬁned using the symmetric braiding in SVec, so that
(f ⊗ g) ◦ (h ⊗ k) = (−1)|g||h|(f ◦ h) ⊗ (g ◦ k). The unit object I is a distinguished
supercategory with one object whose endomorphism superalgebra is k (concentrated
in even parity). The deﬁnition of − ⊠ − on morphisms (i.e.
superfunctors) is
obvious, as are the coherence maps.

Remark 1.3. Example 1.2(iii) is a special case of Example 1.2(iv). Let A and
B be deﬁned from superalgebras A and B as in Example 1.2(ii). Let Bsop be the
supercategory with ob Bsop := ob B, and new composition law a • b := (−1)|a||b|b ◦ a.
Then the supercategory Hom(A ⊠ Bsop, SVec) is isomorphic to A-SMod-B via the
superfunctor which identiﬁes V : A ⊠Bsop → SVec with the superspace obtained by
evaluating at the only object, viewed as a superbimodule so avb := (−1)|b||v|V (a ⊗
b)(v). The data of a supernatural transformation f : V → W is exactly the same
as the data of a superbimodule homomorphism.

Deﬁnition 1.4. (i) A monoidal supercategory is a supercategory A equipped with
a superfunctor − ⊗ − : A ⊠ A → A, a unit object 1, and even supernatural
isomorphisms1 a : (− ⊗ −) ⊗ − ∼⇒ − ⊗ (− ⊗ −), l : 1 ⊗ − ∼⇒ − and r : − ⊗ 1
∼⇒ −
called coherence maps, which satisfy axioms analogous to the ones of a monoidal
category. In any monoidal supercategory, tensor products of morphisms compose
according to the same rule (1.1) that we already observed in SVec. We call this
the super interchange law.

(ii) Given monoidal supercategories A and B, a monoidal superfunctor is a su-
perfunctor F : A → B plus coherence maps c : (F −) ⊗ (F −) ∼⇒ F (− ⊗ −) and
∼→ F 1A satisfying axioms analogous to the ones of a monoidal category;
i : 1B
we require that c is an even supernatural isomorphism and that i is an even iso-
morphism.
(Note we implicitly assume all monoidal (super)functors are strong
throughout the article.)

(iii) Given monoidal superfunctors F, G : A → B, a monoidal natural transfor-

mation is an even supernatural transformation x : F ⇒ G such that

xλ⊗µ ◦ (cF )λ,µ = (cG)λ,µ ◦ (xλ ⊗ xµ),

1By (− ⊗ −) ⊗ − we mean the superfunctor (A ⊠ A) ⊠ A → A obtained by applying ⊗ twice in the
order indicated. Similarly, − ⊗ (− ⊗ −) is a superfunctor A ⊠ (A ⊠ A) → A, but we are viewing it
as a superfunctor (A ⊠ A) ⊠ A → A by using the canonical isomorphism deﬁned by the associator
in SCat. Also, 1 ⊗ − : A → A and − ⊗ 1 : A → A denote the superfunctors deﬁned by tensoring
on the left and right by the unit object, respectively.

x1A ◦ iF = iG,

in HomB((F λ) ⊗ (F µ), G(λ ⊗ µ)) and HomB(1B, G1A), respectively. (There is no
such thing as a monoidal supernatural transformation.)

A monoidal supercategory (resp. superfunctor) is strict if its coherence maps are
identities. There is a version of Mac Lane’s Coherence Theorem [Mac] for monoidal
supercategories. It implies that any monoidal supercategory A is monoidally su-
perequivalent to a strict monoidal supercategory B, i.e. there are monoidal super-
functors F : A → B and G : B → A such that G ◦ F and F ◦ G are isomorphic to
identities via monoidal natural transformations; equivalently, there is a monoidal
superfunctor F : A → B which deﬁnes a superequivalence between the underlying
supercategories.

With a little care about signs, the string calculus mentioned earlier can be used
to represent morphisms in a strict monoidal supercategory A. Thus, a morphism
f ∈ HomA(λ, µ) is the picture

.

µ

f

λ

(1.2)

Often we will omit the object labels λ, µ here. Then the horizontal and vertical
compositions f ⊗ g and f ◦ g are obtained by horizontally and vertically stacking:

f ⊗ g =

f

g

,

f ◦ g =

f

g

.

More complicated pictures should be interpreted by ﬁrst composing horizontally
then composing vertically. For example, the following is (f ⊗ g) ◦ (h ⊗ k):

f

h

g

k

.

Unlike in the purely even setting, this is not the same as (f ◦ h) ⊗ (g ◦ k). In fact,
in pictures, the super interchange law tells us that

f

=

g

f

g

= (−1)|f ||g|

f

g

.

(1.3)

Example 1.5. (i) The supercategory SVec is a monoidal supercategory with tensor
functor as deﬁned above. The unit object is k. More generally, for a superalgebra
A, A-SMod-A is a monoidal supercategory with tensor functor deﬁned by taking
the usual tensor product of superbimodules over A. The unit object is the regular
superbimodule A.

(ii) For a supercategory A, End(A) is a strict monoidal supercategory, with
− ⊗ − deﬁned on functors F, G : A → A by F ⊗ G := F ◦ G, and on supernatural
transformations x : F ⇒ G and y : H ⇒ K so that (x ⊗ y)λ := xKλ ◦ F yλ.
The unit object is the identity functor I : A → A. Later on, we will denote the
horizontal compositions F ⊗ G and x ⊗ y of two superfunctors or two supernatural
transformations simply by F G and xy, respectively.

(iii) Here is a purely diagrammatic example. The odd Brauer supercategory is the
strict monoidal supercategory SB with one generating object ·, an even generating

This was introduced in [KT] where it is called the marked Brauer category, mo-
tivated by Schur-Weyl duality for the Lie superalgebra pn(C). Unlike the Brauer
category deﬁned earlier, there is no parameter δ. Indeed, using the relations and
super interchange, one can check that

1.3. Now we switch the focus to one of the competing notions. Instead of working
with additive categories enriched in the monoidal category SVec, one can work with
module categories over the monoidal category SVecf d (e.g.
see [EGNO, §7.1]),
or equivalently, additive k-linear categories equipped with a strict action of the
cyclic group Z/2 (e.g. see [EW2, §1.3]). We adopt the following language for such
structures:

Deﬁnition 1.6. (i) A Π-category (A, Π, ξ) is a k-linear category A plus a k-linear
endofunctor Π : A → A and a natural isomorphism ξ : Π2 ∼⇒ I such that ξΠ = Πξ
in Hom(Π3, Π). Note then that Π is a self-inverse equivalence.

(ii) Given Π-categories (A, ΠA, ξA) and (B, ΠB, ξB), a Π-functor F : A → B is a
k-linear functor plus the data of a natural isomorphism βF : ΠBF ∼⇒ F ΠA such that
ξBF (ξA)−1 = βF ΠA ◦ ΠBβF in Hom((ΠB)2F, F (ΠA)2). For example, the identity
functor I is a Π-functor with βI = 1Π, and Π is a Π-functor with βΠ := −1Π2. Note
also that the composition of two Π-functors F : A → B and G : B → C is itself a
Π-functor with βGF := GβF ◦ βGF .

(iii) Given Π-functors F, G : A → B, a Π-natural transformation is a natural

transformation x : F ⇒ G such that xΠA ◦ βF = βG ◦ ΠBx in Hom(ΠBF, GΠA).

There is a close relationship between supercategories and Π-categories. To ex-
plain this formally, we need the following intermediate notion. Actually, our expe-
rience suggests this is often the most convenient place to work in practice.

Deﬁnition 1.7. A Π-supercategory (A, Π, ζ) is a supercategory A plus the extra
data of a superfunctor Π : A → A and an odd supernatural isomorphism ζ : Π ∼⇒ I.
Note then that ξ := ζζ : Π2 ∼⇒ I is an even supernatural isomorphism such that
ξΠ = Πξ in Hom(Π3, Π); in particular, Π is a superequivalence.

To specify the extra data needed to make a supercategory into a Π-supercategory,
one just needs to give objects Πλ and odd isomorphisms ζλ : Πλ ∼→ λ for each
λ ∈ ob A. The eﬀect of Π on a morphism f : λ → µ is uniquely determined by the
requirement that ζµ ◦Πf = (−1)|f |f ◦ζλ. It is then automatic that ζ = (ζλ) : Π ∼⇒ I
is an odd supernatural isomorphism.

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

Example 1.8. Given superalgebras A and B, A-SMod-B is a Π-supercategory;
hence, taking A = B = k, so is SVec. To specify Π and ζ, we just need to
deﬁne an (A, B)-supermodule ΠV and an odd isomorphism ζV : ΠV ∼→ V for each
(A, B)-superbimodule V . We take ΠV to be the same underlying vector space as V
viewed as a superspace with the oppsite Z/2-grading (ΠV )¯0 := V¯1 and (ΠV )¯1 := V¯0.
The superbimodule structure on ΠV is deﬁned in terms of the original action by
a·v·b := (−1)|a|avb. This ensures that the identity function on the underlying vector
space deﬁnes an odd superbimodule isomorphism ζV : ΠV ∼→ V . Everything else is
forced, for example, for a morphism f : V → W we must have that Πf : ΠV → ΠW
is the function (−1)|f |f .

Now we can explain the connection between supercategories and Π-categories.
Let SCat be the category of supercategories and superfunctors as above. Also let
Π-SCat be the category of Π-supercategories and superfunctors, and Π-Cat be the
category of Π-categories and Π-functors. There are functors

SCat

(1)
−→ Π-SCat

(2)
−→ Π-Cat.

(1.4)

The functor (1) is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.10 below; it sends supercategory A to its
Π-envelope Aπ. The functor (2) sends Π-supercategory (A, Π, ζ) to the underlying
Π-category (A, Π, ξ), where A and Π are as in Deﬁnition 1.1(v), and ξ := ζζ; it
sends superfunctor F : (A, ΠA, ζA) → (B, ΠB, ζB) to the Π-functor (F , βF ), where
βF := −ζBF (ζA)−1 : ΠBF ∼⇒ F ΠA.
Theorem 1.9. The functors just deﬁned have the following properties:

• The functor (1) is left 2-adjoint to the forgetful functor ν : Π-SCat → SCat
in the sense that there is a superequivalence Hom(A, νB) → Hom(Aπ, B)
for every supercategory A and Π-supercategory B.

• The functor (2) is an equivalence of categories.

Deﬁnition 1.10. The Π-envelope Aπ of supercategory A is the Π-supercategory
with objects {Πaλ | λ ∈ ob A, a ∈ Z/2}, i.e. we double the objects in A. Morphisms
are deﬁned from

HomAπ (Πaλ, Πbµ) := Πa+b HomA(λ, µ),

where the Π on the right hand side is the parity-switching functor on SVec from
Example 1.8. We denote the morphism Πaλ → Πbµ in Aπ coming from a homoge-
neous morphism f : λ → µ in A under this identiﬁcation by f b
a. Thus, if |f | denotes
a : Πaλ → Πbµ is of parity a+b+|f | in Aπ. Composition
the parity of f in A, then f b
a := (f ◦ g)c
in Aπ is induced by composition in A, so f c
a. To make Aπ into a
Π-supercategory, we set Π(Πaλ) := Πa+¯1λ and ζΠaλ := (1λ)a
a+¯1 : Πa+¯1λ → Πaλ. If
F : A → B is a superfunctor, it extends to Fπ : Aπ → Bπ sending Πaλ 7→ Πa(F λ)
and f b

b ◦ gb

a 7→ (F f )b
a.

Remark 1.11. In [Man], one ﬁnds already the notion of a superadditive category.
In our language, this is an additive Π-supercategory. The superadditive envelope of
a supercategory A may be constructed by ﬁrst taking the Π-envelope, then taking
the usual additive envelope after that.

1.4. We can now introduce monoidal Π-categories and monoidal Π-supercategories.
It is best to start with monoidal Π-supercategories, since this deﬁnition is on the
surface. Then we’ll recover the correct deﬁnition of monoidal Π-category on passing
to the underlying category.

8

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

Deﬁnition 1.12. A monoidal Π-supercategory (A, π, ζ) is a monoidal supercate-
gory A with the additional data of a distinguished object π and an odd isomorphism
ζ : π ∼→ 1 from π to the unit object 1.

Any monoidal Π-supercategory (A, π, ζ) is a Π-supercategory in the sense of
Deﬁnition 1.7 with parity-switching functor Π := π ⊗ − : A → A and ζλ :=
lλ ◦ ζ ⊗ 1λ : Πλ ∼→ λ. One could also choose to deﬁne Π to be the functor − ⊗ π, but
that is isomorphic to our choice because there is an even supernatural isomorphism
β : π ⊗ − ∼⇒ − ⊗ π with βλ deﬁned as the composite

π ⊗ λ

ζ⊗1λ−→ 1 ⊗ λ

lλ−→ λ

r−1
λ−→ λ ⊗ 1

1λ⊗ζ−1

−→ λ ⊗ π.

We observe moreover that the pair (π, β) is an object in the Drinfeld center of A,
i.e. we have that

lπ ◦ β1 = rπ,

aλ,µ,π ◦ βλ⊗µ ◦ aπ,λ,µ = (1λ ⊗ βµ) ◦ aλ,π,µ ◦ (βλ ⊗ 1µ),

(1.5)

(1.6)

for all objects λ, µ ∈ ob A. Moreover, βπ = −1π⊗π. There is also an even isomor-
phism ξ := (l1 = r1) ◦ ζ ⊗ ζ : π ⊗ π → 1 such that
(1λ ⊗ ξ−1) ◦ r−1

λ ◦ lλ ◦ (ξ ⊗ 1λ) = aλ,π,π ◦ (βλ ⊗ 1π) ◦ a−1

π,λ,π ◦ (1π ⊗ βλ) ◦ aπ,π,λ (1.7)

in HomA((π ⊗ π) ⊗ λ, λ ⊗ (π ⊗ π)).

Example 1.13. (i) We’ve already explained how A-SMod-A is both a monoidal
supercategory and a Π-supercategory. In fact, it is a monoidal Π-supercategory
with π := ΠA and ζ : ΠA ∼→ A being the identity function.
In particular, this
makes SVec into a monoidal Π-supercategory.

(ii) If (A, Π, ζ) is any Π-supercategory, then (End(A), Π, ζ) is a strict monoidal

Π-supercategory.

Deﬁnition 1.14. (i) A monoidal Π-category (A, π, β, ξ) is a k-linear monoidal
category A plus the extra data of an object (π, β) in its Drinfeld center with βπ =
−1π⊗π, and an isomorphism ξ : π ⊗ π ∼→ 1 satisfying (1.7).

(ii) A monoidal Π-functor between monoidal Π-categories (A, πA, βA, ξA) and
(B, πB, βB, ξB) is a k-linear monoidal functor F : A → B with its usual coher-
∼→ F πA which is an
ence maps c and i, plus an additional coherence map j : πB
isomorphism compatible with the β’s and the ξ’s in the sense that

F (βA)λ ◦ cπA,λ ◦ (j ⊗ 1F λ) = cλ,πA ◦ (1F λ ⊗ j) ◦ (βB)F λ,

i ◦ ξB = F ξA ◦ cπA,πA ◦ (j ⊗ j),

in Hom(πB ⊗ F λ, F (λ ⊗ πA)) and Hom(πB ⊗ πB, F 1A), respectively.

(iii) A monoidal Π-natural transformation x : F ⇒ G between monoidal Π-
functors F, G : A → B is a monoidal natural transformation as usual, such that
xπA ◦ jF = jG in HomB(πB, GπA).

There are categories SMon, Π-SMon and Π-Mon consisting of all monoidal
supercategories, monoidal Π-supercategories and monoidal Π-categories, respec-
tively. Morphisms in SMon and Π-SMon are monoidal superfunctors as in Deﬁ-
nition 1.4(ii). Morphisms in Π-Mon are monoidal Π-functors in the sense of Deﬁ-
nition 1.14(ii). Now, just like in (1.4), there are functors

SMon

−→ Π-SMon

(2)
−→ Π-Mon.

The functor (1) is deﬁned by the Π-envelope construction explained in Deﬁni-
tion 1.16 below. The functor (2) sends monoidal Π-supercategory (A, π, ζ) to the
underlying category A with the obvious monoidal structure, made into a monoidal
Π-category (A, π, β, ξ) as explained before Deﬁnition 1.14.
It sends a monoidal
superfunctor F between monoidal Π-supercategories A and B to F : A → B, made
into a monoidal Π-functor by setting j := (F ζA)−1 ◦ i ◦ ζB : πB

∼→ F πA.

Theorem 1.15. The functors just deﬁned satisfy analogous properties to Theo-
rem 1.9: (1) is left 2-adjoint to the forgetful functor and (2) is an equivalence.

Deﬁnition 1.16. The Π-envelope of a monoidal supercategory A is the monoidal
Π-supercategory (Aπ, π, ζ) where Aπ is as in Deﬁnition 1.10, π := Π¯1
1, ζ := (11)¯0
¯1,
and tensor products of objects and morphisms are deﬁned from

(Πaλ) ⊗ (Πbµ) := Πa+b(λ ⊗ µ),

f b
a ⊗ gd

c := (−1)(c+d+|g|)a+d|f |(f ⊗ g)b+d
a+c.

The unit object of Aπ is Π¯0
1. The coherence maps a, l and r extend to Aπ in an
obvious way. Also if F : A → B is a monoidal superfunctor then the superfunctor
Fπ : Aπ → Bπ from Deﬁnition 1.10 is naturally monoidal too.

In the strict case, one can work with Aπ diagrammatically as follows. For f as

in (1.2), we represent f b

a ∈ HomAπ (Πaλ, Πbµ) by the diagram

Then the rules for horizontal and vertical composition become:

In order to appreciate the need for the sign in this deﬁnition of horizontal compo-
sition, the reader might want to verify the super interchange law in Aπ.

1.5. Let us make a few remarks about Grothendieck groups/rings. Recall for a
category A that its additive Karoubi envelope Kar(A) is the idempotent comple-
tion of the additive envelope of A. The Grothendieck group K0(Kar(A)) is the
Abelian group generated by isomorphism classes of objects of Kar(A), subject to
the relations [V ] + [W ] = [V ⊕ W ]. In case A is a monoidal category, the monoidal
structure on A extends canonically to Kar(A), hence we get a ring structure on
K0(Kar(A)) with [V ] · [W ] = [V ⊗ W ].

For a supercategory A, we propose that the role of additive Karoubi envelope
should be played by the Π-category SKar(A) := Kar(Aπ), i.e. one ﬁrst passes to the
Π-envelope, then to the underlying category, and then one takes additive Karoubi
envelope as usual. The Grothendieck group K0(SKar(A)) comes equipped with a
distinguished involution π deﬁned from π([V ]) := [ΠV ], making it into a module
over the ring

Zπ := Z[π]/(π2 − 1).

10

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

In case A is a monoidal supercategory, SKar(A) is a monoidal Π-category. The
tensor product induces a multiplication on K0(SKar(A)), making it into a Zπ-
algebra.

Example 1.17. (i) Suppose A is a superalgebra viewed as a supercategory A
with one object. Then SKar(A) is equivalent to the category of ﬁnitely gener-
ated projective A-supermodules and even A-supermodule homomorphisms. Hence,
K0(SKar(A)) is the usual split Grothendieck group of the superalgebra A.

(ii) Recall that I, the unit object of the monoidal category SCat, is a supercat-
egory with one object whose endomorphism superalgebra is k. There is a unique
way to deﬁne a tensor product making I into a strict monoidal supercategory. Its
super Karoubi envelope SKar(I) is monoidally equivalent to SVecf d. Hence, it
is a semisimple Abelian category with just two isomorphism classes of irreducible
objects represented by k and Πk, and K0(SKar(I)) ∼= K0(SVecf d) ∼= Zπ.

(iii) Here is an example which may be of independent interest. For δ ∈ k,
the odd Temperley-Lieb supercategory is the strict monoidal supercategory ST L(δ)
with one generating object · and two odd generating morphisms
: 1 → · ⊗ · and

: · ⊗ · → 1, subject to the following relations:

= ,

= − ,

= δ.

The following theorem will be proved in the appendix.

Theorem 1.18. Assume that δ = −(q − q−1) for q ∈ k× that is not a root of unity.
Then SKar(ST L(δ)) is a semisimple Abelian category. Moreover, as a based ring
with canonical basis coming from the isomorphism classes of irreducible objects,
K0(SKar(ST L(δ))) is isomorphic to the subring of Zπ[x, x−1] spanned over Z by

(cid:8)[n + 1]x,π, π[n + 1]x,π (cid:12)(cid:12) n ∈ N(cid:9), where

[n + 1]x,π := xn + πxn−2 + · · · + πnx−n.

(1.9)

When k is of characteristic zero, we will explain this result by constructing a
monoidal equivalence between SKar(ST L(δ)) and the category of ﬁnite-dimensional
representations of the quantum superalgebra Uq(osp1|2) as deﬁned by Clark and
Wang [CW]. We note that

[n + 1]x,π[m + 1]x,π =

min(m,n)X

r=0

πr[n + m − 2r + 1]x,π,

(1.10)

which may be interpreted as the analog of Clebsch-Gordon for Uq(osp1|2). Also

∞X

[n]x,πtn =

n=0

1

1 − [2]x,πt + πt2 ,

(1.11)

which is a π-deformed version of the generating function for Chebyshev polynomials
of the second kind. It follows that K0(SKar(ST L(δ))) is a polynomial algebra over
Zπ generated by [2]x,π, which is the isomorphism class of the generating object ·.

1.7.
In the remainder of the article, we will work in the more general setting
of 2-categories. Recalling that a monoidal category is essentially the same as a
2-category with one object, the reader should have no trouble recovering the deﬁ-
nitions made in this introduction from the more general ones formulated later on.

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

11

In Section 2, we will discuss 2-supercategories, which (in the strict case) are
categories enriched in SCat; the basic example is the 2-supercategory of supercat-
egories, superfunctors and supernatural transformations. Then in Section 3, we
introduce Π-2-supercategories; the basic example is the Π-2-supercategory of Π-
supercategories, superfunctors and supernatural transformations. Section 4 devel-
ops the appropriate generalization of the notion of Π-envelope to 2-supercategories,
in particular establishing the properties of the functors (1) above. In Section 5, we
discuss Π-2-categories; the basic example is the Π-2-category of Π-categories, Π-
functors and Π-natural transformations. Then we prove that the functors (2) above
are equivalences; more generally, we show that the categories of Π-2-categories and
Π-2-supercategories are equivalent.

The approach to Z/2-graded categories developed by this point can also be ap-
plied in almost exactly the same way to Z-graded categories. We give a brief
account of this in the ﬁnal Section 6. Actually, we will combine the two gradings
into a single Z ⊕ Z/2-grading, and develop a theory of graded supercategories. Al-
though we won’t discuss it further here, there are two natural ways to suppress the
Z/2-grading (thereby leaving the domain of superalgebra): one can either view Z-
gradings as Z ⊕ Z/2-gradings with the Z/2-grading being trivial, i.e. concentrated
in parity ¯0; or one can view Z-gradings as Z ⊕ Z/2-gradings with the Z/2-grading
being induced by the Z-grading, i.e. all elements of degree n ∈ Z are of parity n
(mod 2). The ﬁrst of these variations is already extensively used in representation
theory, e.g. see the last paragraph of [R, §2.2.1] or [BLW, §5.2].

We would like to say ﬁnally that many of the general deﬁnitions in this article
can be found in some equivalent form in many places in the literature. We were
inﬂuenced especially by the work of Kang, Kashiwara and Oh in [KKO, Section 7];
see also [EL, Section 2]. Our choice of terminology is diﬀerent. We include here a
brief dictionary for readers familiar with [KKO] and [EL]; note also that in [KKO]
additivity is assumed from the outset.

There is a similar linguistic clash in our development of the graded theory in Section
6: by a graded category, we mean a category enriched in graded vector spaces. It is
more common in the literature for a graded category to mean a category equipped
with a distinguished autoequivalence. When working with the latter structure, we
will denote the equivalence by Q, and call it a Q-category.

Acknowledgements. The ﬁrst author would like to thank Jon Kujawa for convincing
him to take categories enriched in super vector spaces seriously in the ﬁrst place.
We also beneﬁtted greatly from conversations with Victor Ostrik and Ben Elias.

2. Supercategories

In the main body of the article, k will denote some ﬁxed commutative ground
ring. By superspace, we mean now a Z/2-graded k-module V = V¯0 ⊕ V¯1; as usual
when working over a commutative ring, we make no distinction between left modules
and right modules, indeed, we’ll often view k-modules as (k, k)-bimodules whose
left and right actions are related by cv = vc. By a linear map, we mean a k-module
homomorphism. Viewing k as a superalgebra concentrated in even parity, these are
the same as k-supermodules and k-supermodule homomorphisms2.

We have the Π-supercategory SVec of all superspaces3 and linear maps deﬁned
just like in the introduction. The underlying category SVec consisting of super-
spaces and even linear maps is a symmetric monoidal category with braiding deﬁned
as in the introduction.

Recall also the deﬁnitions of superfunctor and supernatural transformation from
Deﬁnition 1.1. Let SCat be the category of all supercategories and superfunctors.
We make it into a monoidal category with tensor functor denoted ⊠ as explained
after Example 1.2.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A strict 2-supercategory is a category enriched in the monoidal cat-
egory SCat just deﬁned. Thus, for objects λ, µ in a strict 2-supercategory A, there
is given a supercategory HomA(λ, µ) of morphisms from λ to µ, whose objects F, G
are the 1-morphisms of A, and whose morphisms x : F → G are the 2-morphisms
of A. We use the shorthand HomA(F, G) for the superspace HomHomA(λ,µ)(F, G)
of all such 2-morphisms.

The string calculus explained for monoidal supercategories in the introduction
can also be used for strict 2-supercategories: given 1-morphisms F, G : λ → µ, one
represents a 2-morphism x : F ⇒ G by the picture

G

µ

x

λ.

F

The composition y ◦ x of x with another 2-morphism y ∈ HomA(G, H) is obtained
by vertically stacking pictures:

µ

H

y

G

x

F

λ.

The composition law in A gives a coherent family of superfunctors

Tν,µ,λ : HomA(µ, ν) ⊠ HomA(λ, µ) → HomA(λ, ν)

for all objects λ, µ, ν ∈ A. Given 2-morphisms x : F → H, y : G → K between
1-morphisms F, H : λ → µ, G, K : µ → ν, we denote Tν,µ,λ(y ⊗ x) : Tν,µ,λ(G, F ) →

2In Sections 2–4, one can actually work even more generally over any commutative superalgebra
k = k¯0 ⊕ k¯1, interpreting a superspace as a (k, k)-superbimodule whose left and right actions are
related by cv = (−1)|c||v|vc.
3One should be careful about set-theoretic issues here by ﬁxing a Grothendieck universe and taking
only small superspaces. We won’t be doing anything high enough for this to cause diﬃculties, so
will ignore issues of this nature.

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

Tν,µ,λ(K, H) simply by yx : GF → KH, and represent it by horizontally stacking
pictures:

K

ν

y

µ

G

H

x

F

λ.

When confusion seems unlikely, we will use the same notation for a 1-morphism F
as for its identity 2-morphism. With this convention, we have that yH ◦ Gx = yx =
(−1)|x||y|Kx ◦ yF , or in pictures:

ν

K

y

G

H

x

This identity is a special case of the super interchange law in a strict 2-supercategory,
which is proved by the following calculation:

(vu) ◦ (yx) = Tν,µ,λ(v ⊗ u) ◦ Tν,µ,λ(y ⊗ x) = Tν,µ,λ((v ⊗ u) ◦ (y ⊗ x))

= (−1)|u||y|Tν,µ,λ((v ◦ y) ⊗ (u ◦ x)) = (−1)|u||y|(v ◦ y)(u ◦ x).

The presence of the sign here means that a strict 2-supercategory is not a 2-category
in the usual sense.

For example, we can make SCat into a strict 2-supercategory SCat by declaring
that its morphism categories are the supercategories Hom(A, B) consisting of all
superfunctors from A to B, with morphisms being all supernatural transformations.
The horizontal composition GF of two superfunctors F : A → B and G : B → C
is deﬁned by GF := G ◦ F . The horizontal composition yx : GF ⇒ KH of
supernatural transformations x : F ⇒ H and y : G ⇒ K is given by (yx)λ :=
yHλ ◦ Gxλ for each object λ of A. We leave it to the reader to verify that the super
interchange law holds; this works because of the signs built into the deﬁnition of
supernatural transformation.

So far, we have only deﬁned the notion of strict 2-supercategory. There is also
a weak notion, which we call simply 2-supercategory, in which the horizontal com-
position is only assumed to be associative and unital up to some even supernatural
isomorphisms. The following are the superizations of the deﬁnitions in the purely
even setting (e.g. see the deﬁnition of bicategory in [L], or [R, §2.2.2]), replacing
the usual Cartesian product × of categories with the product ⊠.

Deﬁnition 2.2. (i) A 2-supercategory A consists of:

• A set of objects ob A.
• A supercategory HomA(µ, λ) for each λ, µ ∈ ob A, whose objects and mor-
phisms are called 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms, respectively. We refer to
the composition of 2-morphisms in these supercategories as vertical compo-
sition.

• A family of 1-morphisms 1λ : λ → λ for each λ ∈ ob A.
• Superfunctors Tν,µ,λ : HomA(µ, ν) ⊠ HomA(λ, µ) → HomA(λ, ν) for all
λ, µ, ν ∈ ob A. We usually denote Tν,µ,λ simply by −−, and call it horizontal
composition.

• Even supernatural isomorphisms a : (− −) − ∼⇒ − (− −), l : 1λ − ∼⇒ −
∼⇒ − in all situations that such horizontal compositions makes

and r : − 1λ
sense.

A 1-morphism F : λ → µ in a 2-supercategory is called a superequivalence if there
is a 1-morphism G in the other direction such that GF ∼= 1λ and F G ∼= 1µ via
even 2-isomorphisms.

(ii) A 2-superfunctor R : A → B between 2-supercategories is the following data:

• A function R : ob A → ob B.
• Superfunctors R : HomA(λ, µ) → HomB(Rλ, Rµ) for λ, µ ∈ ob A.
• Even supernatural isomorphisms c : (R −) (R −) ∼⇒ R(− −).
• Even 2-isomorphisms i : 1Rλ

∼⇒ R1λ for all λ ∈ ob A.

Then we require that the following diagrams commute:

(R(− −)) (R −)

There is a natural way to compose two 2-superfunctors. Also each 2-supercategory
A possesses an identity 2-superfunctor, which will be denoted I. Hence, we get a
category 2-SCat consisting of 2-supercategories and 2-superfunctors.

(iii) Given 2-superfunctors R, S : A → B for 2-supercategories A and B, a 2-

natural transformation4 (X, x) : R ⇒ S is the following data:
• 1-morphisms Xλ : Rλ → Sλ in B for each λ ∈ ob A.

A 2-natural transformation (X, x) is strong5 if each xµ,λ is an isomorphism. There
is a 2-category 2-SCat consisting of all 2-supercategories, 2-superfunctors and 2-
natural transformations.

(iv) Suppose that (X, x), (Y, y) : R → S are 2-natural transformations for 2-
superfunctors R, S : A → B. A supermodiﬁcation α : (X, x) ⇒−− (Y, y) is a family of
2-morphisms αλ = αλ,¯0 + αλ,¯1 : Xλ ⇒ Yλ for all λ ∈ ob A, such that the diagram

where (αp)λ := αλ,p. This makes the space Hom((X, x), (Y, y)) of supermodiﬁca-
tions α : (X, x) ⇒−− (Y, y) into a superspace. There is a supercategory Hom(R, S)
consisting of all 2-natural transformations and supermodiﬁcations. There is a 2-
supercategory Hom(A, B) consisting of 2-superfunctors, 2-natural transformations
and supermodiﬁcations;
it is strict if B is strict. These are the morphism 2-
supercategories in the strict 3-supercategory of 2-supercategories. Since we won’t
do anything with this here, we omit the details.

We note that a strict 2-supercategory in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.1 is the same

thing as a 2-supercategory whose coherence maps a, l and r are identities.
the strict case, the unit objects 1λ are uniquely determined, so do not need to
be given as part of the data. A strict 2-superfunctor is a 2-superfunctor whose
coherence maps c and i are identities. There exist 2-superfunctors between strict
2-supercategories which are themselves not strict.

Recall for superalgebras A and B that B-SMod-A denotes the supercategory of
(B, A)-superbimodules; see Example 1.2(iii). Given another superalgebra C, the
usual tensor product over B gives a superfunctor

− ⊗B − : C-SMod-B ⊠ B-SMod-A → C-SMod-A.

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

The 2-supercategory SBim of superbimodules has objects that are superalgebras,
the morphism supercategories are deﬁned from HomSBim(A, B) := B-SMod-A,
and horizontal composition comes from the tensor product operation just men-
tioned. It gives a basic example of a 2-supercategory which is not strict.

Two 2-supercategories A and B are 2-superequivalent if there are 2-superfunctors
R : A → B and S : B → A such that S ◦ R and R ◦ S are superequivalent
to the identities in Hom(A, A) and Hom(B, B), respectively. Equivalently, there
is a 2-superfunctor R : A → B that induces a superequivalence HomA(λ, µ) →
HomB(Rλ, Rµ) for all λ, µ ∈ ob A, and every ν ∈ ob B is superequivalent to an
object of the form Rλ for some λ ∈ ob A.

The Coherence Theorem for 2-supercategories implies that any 2-supercategory
is 2-superequivalent to a strict 2-supercategory. The proof can be obtained by
mimicking the argument in the purely even case from [L]. In view of this result, we
will sometimes assume for simplicity that we are working in the strict case.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let A be a 2-supercategory. The Drinfeld center of A is the
monoidal supercategory of all strong 2-natural transformations I ⇒ I and super-
modiﬁcations. Thus, an object (X, x) of the Drinfeld center is a coherent family of
∼
⇒ − Xλ
1-morphisms Xλ : λ → λ and even supernatural isomorphisms xµ,λ : Xµ −
for λ, µ ∈ ob A; a morphism α : (X, x) ⇒−− (Y, y) is coherent family of 2-morphisms
αλ : Xλ ⇒ Yλ. The tensor product (X ⊗ Y, x ⊗ y) of objects (X, x) and (Y, y)
is deﬁned from (X ⊗ Y )λ := XλYλ, (x ⊗ y)µ,λ := xµ,λyµ,λ; the tensor product
α ⊗ β of morphisms α : (X, x) → (U, u) and β : (Y, y) → (V, v) is deﬁned from
(α ⊗ β)λ := αλβλ. If A is strict then its Drinfeld center is strict too.

We remark that the Drinfeld center of a 2-supercategory is a braided monoidal
supercategory, although we omit the deﬁnition of such a structure. (See [MS] for
more about Drinfeld center in the purely even setting.)

3. Π-Supercategories

According to Deﬁnition 1.7, a Π-supercategory is a supercategory with the addi-
tional data of a parity-switching functor Π and an odd supernatural isomorphism
ζ : Π ∼⇒ I.
It is an easy structure to work with as there are no additional ax-
ioms, unlike the situation for the Π-categories of Deﬁnition 1.6. The same goes for
superfunctors and supernatural transformations between Π-supercategories: there
are no additional compatibility constraints with respect to Π.

Deﬁnition 3.1. A Π-2-supercategory (A, π, ζ) is a 2-supercategory A plus families
π = (πλ) and ζ = (ζλ) of 1-morphisms πλ : λ → λ and odd 2-isomorphisms
ζλ ∈ HomA(πλ, 1λ) for each object λ ∈ A. It is strict if A is strict.

Let Π-SCat be the category of all Π-supercategories and superfunctors. Let
Π-SCat be the strict 2-supercategory of all Π-supercategories, superfunctors and
supernatural transformations. The latter gives the archetypal example of a strict
Π-2-supercategory: the additional data of π = (πA) and ζ = (ζA) are deﬁned by
letting πA be the parity-switching functor ΠA : A → A on the Π-supercategory A,
∼⇒ IA.
and taking ζA : πA
The basic example of a Π-2-supercategory that is not strict is the 2-supercategory
SBim deﬁned at the end of the previous section. Recall the objects are superalge-
bras, the 1-morphisms are superbimodules, the 2-morphisms are superbimodule ho-
momorphisms, and horizontal composition is given by tensor product. Also, for each

∼→ 1A to be the given odd supernatural isomorphism ΠA

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

17

object (i.e. superalgebra) A, the unit 1-morphism 1A is the regular superbimodule
A. The extra data π and ζ needed to make SBim into a Π-2-supercategory are
given by declaring that πA := ΠA (i.e. we apply the parity-switching functor to
∼⇒ 1A comes from the superbimodule
the regular superbimodule), and each ζA : πA
homomorphism ΠA → A that is the identity function on the underlying set.

Each morphism supercategory HomA(λ, µ) in a Π-2-supercategory A admits a
parity-switching functor Π making it into a Π-supercategory, namely, the endo-
functor πµ− arising by horizontally composing on the left by πµ. Alternatively, one
could take the endofunctor −πλ deﬁned by horizontally composing on the right by
πλ. These two choices are isomorphic according to our ﬁrst lemma.

Lemma 3.2. Let (A, π, ζ) be a Π-2-supercategory. For objects λ, µ, there is an
even supernatural isomorphism

βµ,λ : πµ− ∼⇒ − πλ.

Assuming A is strict for simplicity, this is deﬁned by (βµ,λ)F := −ζµF ζ−1
for each
λ
1-morphism F : λ → µ. Setting β := (βµ,λ), the pair (π, β) is an object in the
Drinfeld center of A as in Deﬁnition 2.3, i.e.
the following hold (still assuming

(i) (βν,λ)GF = G(βµ,λ)F ◦(βν,µ)GF for 1-morphisms F : λ → µ and G : µ → ν;
(ii) (βλ,λ)1λ = 1πλ.

Moreover:

Proof. To show that βµ,λ is an even supernatural isomorphism, we need to show
for any 2-morphism x : F ⇒ G between 1-morphisms F, G : λ → µ that

xπλ ◦ (βµ,λ)F = (βµ,λ)G ◦ πµx.

(3.1)

This follows from the following calculation with the super interchange law:

xπλ ◦ ζµGζ−1

λ = (−1)|x|ζµxζ−1
λ ◦ ζν Gζ−1

λ = ζµF ζ−1
λ ◦ πµx.
µ F = −ζνGF ζ−1
For (i), we must show that GζµF ζ−1
λ , which is clear by
the super interchange law again. For (ii), we have that −ζλζ−1
λ = ζ−1
λ ◦ ζλ = 1πλ.
For (iii), ζλζλ = ζλ ◦ πλζλ = −ζλ ◦ ζλπλ. Cancelling ζλ on the left, we deduce that
πλζλ = −ζλπλ, hence −ζλπλζ−1
. Finally (iv) follows from
the calculation:

λ ◦ ζλπλ = −1π2

λ = πλζ−1

λ = ζµζµF = ξµF.

(cid:3)

Applying Lemma 3.2 to the strict Π-2-supercategory Π-SCat, we obtain the

following.

Corollary 3.3. Let (A, ΠA, ζA) and (B, ΠB, ζB) be Π-supercategories. As in Deﬁni-

(ii) For a superfunctor F : A → B, deﬁne βF := −ζBF (ζA)−1 : ΠBF ⇒ F ΠA.
This is an even supernatural isomorphism such that ξBF (ξA)−1 = βF ΠA ◦
ΠBβF in Hom((ΠB)2F, F (ΠA)2).

(iii) If x : F ⇒ G is a supernatural transformation between superfunctors F, G :

A → B then βG ◦ ΠBx = xΠA ◦ βF in Hom(ΠBF, GΠA).

(iv) For superfunctors F : A → B and G : B → C, we have that βGF =

GβF ◦ βGF . Also βI = 1Π and βΠ = −1Π2.

When working with Π-2-supercategories, notions of 2-superfunctors, 2-natural
transformations and supermodiﬁcations are just as deﬁned for 2-supercategories in
Deﬁnition 2.2: there are no additional compatibility constraints. Let Π-2-SCat be
the category of all Π-2-supercategories and 2-superfunctors, and Π-2-SCat be the
strict 2-category of all Π-2-supercategories, 2-superfunctors and 2-natural transfor-
mations.

4. Envelopes

In this subsection, we prove the statements about the functors (1) in Theo-
rems 1.9 and 1.15. We will also construct Π-envelopes of 2-supercategories. We
start at the level of supercategories. Recall the functor −π : SCat → Π-SCat from
Deﬁnition 1.10, which sends supercategory A to its Π-envelope (Aπ, Π, ζ), and su-
perfunctor F to Fπ. In fact, this is part of the data of a strict 2-superfunctor

−π : SCat → Π-SCat,

(4.1)

sending a supernatural transformation x : F ⇒ G to xπ : Fπ ⇒ Gπ deﬁned from
(xπ)Πaλ := (−1)|x|a(xλ)a
a.

For any supercategory A, there is a canonical superfunctor J : A → Aπ which
sends λ 7→ Π¯0λ and f 7→ f ¯0
It is also dense: each
object Π¯0λ of Aπ is obviously in the image, while Π¯1λ is isomorphic to Π¯0λ via
the odd isomorphism (1λ)¯0
¯1. This means that A and Aπ are equivalent as abstract
categories. However they need not be superequivalent as J need not be evenly
dense:

¯0 . This is full and faithful.

Lemma 4.1. The canonical superfunctor J : A → Aπ is a superequivalence if and
only if A admits a parity-switching functor, meaning that every object of A is the
target of an odd isomorphism.

Proof. The “only if” direction is clear as Aπ admits a parity-switching functor.
Conversely, assume that A admits a parity-switching functor. To show that J is
a superequivalence, it suﬃces to check that it is evenly dense. Let λ be an object
¯0 : Π¯0µ → Π¯1λ is an
of A and f : µ → λ be an odd isomorphism in A. Then f ¯1
even isomorphism in Aπ. Hence, Π¯1λ is isomorphic via an even isomorphism to
something in the image of J, as of course is Π¯0λ.
(cid:3)

Here is the universal property of Π-envelopes.

Lemma 4.2. Suppose A is a supercategory and (B, Π′, ζ′) is a Π-supercategory.

(i) Given a superfunctor F : A → B, there is a unique superfunctor ˜F : Aπ →

B such that F = ˜F J and ˜F ζJλ = ζ′

F λ for each λ ∈ ob A.

(ii) Given a supernatural transformation x : F ⇒ G between superfunctors
F, G : A → B, there is a unique supernatural transformation ˜x : ˜F ⇒ ˜G
such that (˜x)Jλ = xλ for each λ ∈ ob A.

Proof. (i) We must have that ˜F (Πaλ) = (Π′)a(F λ) and ˜F (f b

Most of the time, Lemmas 4.1–4.2 are all that one needs when working with
Π-envelopes in practice. The following gives a more formal statement, enough to
establish the claim made about the functor (1) in Theorem 1.9 from the introduc-
tion. To state it, we let ν : Π-SCat → SCat be the obvious forgetful 2-superfunctor.

Theorem 4.3. For all supercategories A and Π-supercategories B, there is a func-
torial superequivalence Hom(A, νB) → Hom(Aπ, B), sending superfunctor F to ˜F
and supernatural transformation x to ˜x, both as deﬁned in Lemma 4.2. Hence, the
strict 2-superfunctor −π is left 2-adjoint to ν.

Proof. We must show that the given superfunctor is fully faithful and evenly dense.
The fully faithfulness follows from Lemma 4.2(ii). To see that it is evenly dense,
take a superfunctor F : Aπ → B and consider F J : A → νB. We claim that there

is an even supernatural isomorphism fF J ∼= F . To see this, it suﬃces to produce
an even isomorphism Π′F (Π¯0λ) ∼→ F (Π¯1λ) for each λ ∈ ob A, which we get from
Corollary 3.3(ii).
(cid:3)

We turn our attention to 2-supercategories.

Deﬁnition 4.4. The Π-envelope of a 2-supercategory A is the Π-2-supercategory
(Aπ, π, ζ) with morphism supercategories that are the Π-envelopes of the morphism
supercategories in A:

• The object set for Aπ is the same as for A.
• The set of 1-morphisms λ → µ in Aπ is

{ΠaF | for all 1-morphisms F : λ → µ in A and a ∈ Z/2}.

• The horizontal composition of 1-morphisms ΠaF : λ → µ and ΠbG : µ → ν

is deﬁned by (ΠbG)(ΠaF ) := Πa+b(GF ).

• The superspace of 2-morphisms ΠaF ⇒ ΠbG in Aπ is deﬁned from

HomAπ (ΠaF, ΠbG) := Πa+b HomA(F, G).

We denote the 2-morphism ΠaF ⇒ ΠbG coming from x : F ⇒ G under
this identiﬁcation by xb

If x is homogeneous of parity |x| then xb

a := (y ◦ x)c

• The units 1λ in Aπ are the 1-morphisms Π¯0

• The structure maps a, l and r in Aπ are induced by the ones in A in the
obvious way, but there are some signs to be checked to see that this makes

the following two expressions agree:

The main check needed to verify that this is indeed a Π-2-supercategory is made
in the following lemma:

super interchange law.

Proof. We need to show that

using the super interchange law in A for the last equality. The right hand side

a =

(−1)(c+e+|u|)(b+d+|y|)+(a+e+|u|+|x|)b+e(|v|+|y|)((v ◦ y)(u ◦ x))e+f

We leave it to the reader to check that the signs here are indeed equal.

(cid:3)

For any 2-supercategory A, there is a canonical strict 2-superfunctor J : A → Aπ;
it is the identity on objects, it sends the 1-morphism F : λ → µ to Π¯0F , and the
¯0 : Π¯0F ⇒ Π¯0G. The analog of Lemma 4.1 is as follows:
2-morphism x : F ⇒ G to x¯0
Lemma 4.6. For a 2-supercategory A, the canonical 2-superfunctor J : A → Aπ is
a 2-superequivalence if and only if A possesses 1-morphisms πλ : λ → λ and odd
2-isomorphisms πλ ∼= 1λ for every λ ∈ ob A.

Proof. Applying Lemma 4.1 to the morphism supercategories, we get that J is a
2-superequivalence if and only if every 1-morphism in A is the target of an odd
It is clearly suﬃcient to verify this condition just for the unit
2-isomorphism.
1-morphisms 1λ in A.
(cid:3)

Taking Π-envelopes actually deﬁnes a strict 2-functor

−π : 2-SCat → Π-2-SCat.

(4.4)

We still need to specify this on 2-superfunctors and 2-natural transformations. If
R : A → B is a 2-superfunctor, we let Rπ : Aπ → Bπ be the 2-superfunctor
equal to R on objects, and given by the rules ΠaF 7→ Πa(RF ) on 1-morphisms and
xb
a 7→ (Rx)b
a on 2-morphisms. If (X, x) : R ⇒ S is a 2-natural transformation, we let
(Xπ, xπ) : Rπ ⇒ Sπ be the 2-natural transformation deﬁned from (Xπ)λ := Π¯0Xλ
and ((xπ)µ,λ)ΠaF := ((xµ,λ)F )a
a. The universal property from Lemma 4.2 extends
as follows:

Lemma 4.7. Suppose A is a 2-supercategory and (B, π′, ζ′) is a Π-2-supercategory.

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

21

(i) Given a 2-superfunctor R : A → B, there is a unique 2-superfunctor ˜R :

Aπ → B such that R = ˜RJ and ˜Rζλ = ζ′

Rλ for all λ ∈ ob A.

(ii) Given a 2-natural transformation (X, x) : R ⇒ S between 2-superfunctors
R, S : A → B, there is a unique 2-natural transformation ( ˜X, ˜x) : ˜R ⇒ ˜S
such that ˜Xλ = Xλ for λ ∈ ob A and (˜xµ,λ)JF := J(xµ,λ)F for all 1-
morphisms F in A.

Using this, one can prove the following. In the statement, ν denotes the obvious

forgetful functor (actually, here it is a 2-functor).

Theorem 4.8. For all 2-supercategories A and Π-2-supercategories B, there is a
functorial equivalence Hom(A, νB) → Hom(Aπ, B), sending 2-superfunctor R to
˜R and 2-natural transformation (X, x) to ( ˜X, ˜x), both as deﬁned in Lemma 4.7.
Hence, the strict 2-functor −π is left 2-adjoint to ν.

On specializing to 2-supercategories with one object, this implies the result about

the functor (1) made in the statement of Theorem 1.15 from the introduction.

Remark 4.9. In fact, we should really go one level higher here, viewing −π as
a strict 3-superfunctor from the strict 3-supercategory of 2-supercategories to the
strict 3-supercategory of Π-2-supercategories, by associating a supermodiﬁcation
απ : (Xπ, xπ) ⇒−− (Yπ, yπ) to each supermodiﬁcation α : (X, x) ⇒−− (Y, y) deﬁned from
(απ)λ := (αλ)¯0
¯0. We leave it to the reader to formulate an appropriate part (iii)
to Lemma 4.7 explaining how to extend α : (X, x) ⇒−− (Y, y) to ˜α : ( ˜X, ˜x) ⇒−− ( ˜Y , ˜y).
Then Theorem 4.8 becomes a 2-superequivalence

Hom(A, νB) → Hom(Aπ, B).

In particular, it follows that there is an induced monoidal superfunctor from the
Drinfeld center of a 2-supercategory A to the Drinfeld center of its Π-envelope Aπ;
the latter is a monoidal Π-supercategory in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.12.

5. Π-Categories

We continue to assume that k is a commutative ground ring. Let Π-Cat be
the category of all Π-categories and Π-functors in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.6. Re-
call also that we denote the underlying category of a supercategory A by A; see
Deﬁnition 1.1(v).
If (A, ΠA, ζA) is a Π-supercategory and we set ξA := ζAζA,
then (A, ΠA, ξA) is a Π-category thanks to Corollary 3.3(i). Given another Π-
supercategory (B, ΠB, ζB) and a superfunctor F : A → B, Corollary 3.3(ii) explains
how to construct the additional natural isomorphism βF needed to make the un-
derlying functor F into a Π-functor from (A, ΠA, ξA) to (B, ΠB, ξB). Using also
Corollary 3.3(iv), this shows that there is a functor

E1 : Π-SCat → Π-Cat

(A, Π, ζ) 7→ (A, Π, ξ), F 7→ (F , βF ).

(5.1)

This is the functor (2) in (1.4).

In order to complete the proof of Theorem 1.9, we must show that the functor
E1 is an equivalence, so that a Π-supercategory (A, Π, ζ) can be recovered up to
superequivalence from its underlying category (A, Π, ξ). To establish this, we deﬁne
a functor in the other direction:

D1 : Π-Cat → Π-SCat

(A, Π, ξ) 7→ ( bA, bΠ, ζ),

(F, βF ) 7→ bF .

(5.2)

22

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

This sends Π-category (A, Π, ξ) to the associated Π-supercategory ( bA, bΠ, ζ), which
is the supercategory with the same objects as A and morphisms Hom bA(λ, µ)¯0 :=
HomA(λ, µ), Hom bA(λ, µ)¯1 := HomA(λ, Πµ). Composition in bA is induced by the
composition in A: if ˆf : λ → µ and ˆg : µ → ν are homogeneous morphisms in bA
• if ˆf and ˆg are both even, so ˆf = f and ˆg = g for morphisms f : λ → µ and

then

g : µ → ν in A, then we set ˆg ◦ ˆf := g ◦ f ;

• if ˆf is even and ˆg is odd, so ˆf = f and ˆg = g for f : λ → µ and g : µ → Πν

in A, then we again set ˆg ◦ ˆf := g ◦ f ;

• if ˆf is odd and ˆg is even, so ˆf = f and ˆg = g for f : λ → Πµ and g : µ → ν,

we set ˆg ◦ ˆf := (Πg) ◦ f ;

• if ˆf and ˆg are both odd, so ˆf = f and ˆg = g for f : λ → Πµ and g : µ → Πν,

we set ˆg ◦ ˆf := ξν ◦ (Πg) ◦ f .

The check that (ˆh◦ ˆg)◦ ˆf = ˆh◦ (ˆg ◦ ˆf ) for odd ˆf , ˆg, ˆh depends on the axiom ξΠ = Πξ.
To make bA into a Π-supercategory, we deﬁne bΠ : bA → bA to be the superfunctor
that is equal to Π on objects, while bΠ ˆf := Πf if ˆf is even coming from f : λ → µ
in A, and bΠ ˆf := −Πf if ˆf is odd coming from f : λ → Πµ in A. The odd natural
isomorphism ζ : bΠ → I is deﬁned on object λ by ζλ := 1Πλ, i.e. it is the identity
morphism Πλ → Πλ in A viewed as an odd morphism Πλ → λ in bA. Finally, if
(F, βF ) : A → B is a Π-functor, we get induced a superfunctor bF : bA → bB between
homogeneous morphism ˆf : λ → µ in bA we have that bF ˆf := F f if ˆf is even coming
from f : λ → µ in A, or bF ˆf := (βF )−1
µ ◦ F f if ˆf is odd coming from f : λ → ΠAµ
in A. The check that bF (ˆg ◦ ˆf ) = (bF ˆg) ◦ (bF ˆf ) for odd ˆf , ˆg depends on the axiom
F ξA = ξBF ◦ ΠBβ−1

the associated supercategories as follows:

it is the same as F on objects; on a

F ◦ β−1

F ΠA.

Lemma 5.1. The functors D1 : Π-Cat → Π-SCat and E1 : Π-SCat → Π-Cat are
mutually inverse equivalences of categories.

Proof. We have simply that E1 ◦ D1 = IΠ-Cat. It remains to show that D1 ◦ E1 ∼=
∼⇒
IΠ-SCat. To see this, we have to deﬁne a natural isomorphism T : D1 ◦ E1
IΠ-SCat. So for each Π-supercategory (A, Π, ζ), we need to produce an isomorphism

of supercategories TA : d(A) ∼→ A. We take TA to be the identity on objects (which
are the same in d(A) as in A). On a morphism ˆf : λ → µ in d(A), we let TA( ˆf ) := f
if ˆf is even coming from an even morphism f : λ → µ in A, or ζµ ◦ f if ˆf is odd
coming from an even morphism f : λ → Πµ in A.

To check that TA is a functor, we need to show that TA(ˆg ◦ ˆf ) = TA(ˆg) ◦ TA( ˆf )

for ˆf : λ → µ and ˆg : µ → ν:

• This is clear if both ˆf and ˆg are even.
• If ˆf is even and ˆg is odd, so ˆf = f and ˆg = g for even f : λ → µ and

g : µ → Πν in A, we have that TA(ˆg ◦ ˆf ) = ζν ◦ g ◦ f = TA(ˆg) ◦ TA( ˆf ).

• If f is odd and g is even, so ˆf = f and ˆg = g for f : λ → Πµ and g : µ → ν,
then TA(ˆg ◦ ˆf ) = ζν ◦ (Πg) ◦ f , while TA(ˆg) ◦ TA( ˆf ) = g ◦ ζµ ◦ f . These are
equal as ζν ◦ Πg = g ◦ ζµ by the supernaturality of ζ.

• If both are odd, so ˆf = f and ˆg = g for f : λ → Πµ and g : µ → Πν, then
TA(ˆg ◦ ˆf ) = ξν ◦ (Πg) ◦ f . By the super interchange law, ξν = −ζν ◦ ζΠν,

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

23

while supernaturality of ζ gives that ζΠν ◦ Πg = −g ◦ ζµ. Hence, TA(ˆg ◦ ˆf )
equals ζν ◦ g ◦ ζµ ◦ f = TA(ˆg) ◦ TA( ˆf ).

To see that TA is an isomorphism, we just need to see that it is bijective on
morphisms. This is clear on even morphisms, and follows on odd morphisms be-
cause the function Homd(A)(λ, µ)¯1 = HomA(λ, Πµ)¯0 → HomA(λ, µ)¯1, f 7→ ζµ ◦ f is
invertible with inverse f 7→ ζ−1

µ ◦ f .

Finally we must check the naturality of T : there is an equality of superfunc-

supercategories A and B. This is clear on objects and even morphisms. Consider

tors F TA = TBd(F ) : d(A) → B for any superfunctor F : A → B between Π-
an odd morphism ˆf : λ → µ in d(A) coming from an even morphism f : λ → ΠAµ
in A. We have that F (TA ˆf ) = F (ζA)µ ◦ F f and TB(d(F ) ˆf ) = (ζB)F µ ◦ (βF )−1
µ ◦ F f .
These are equal because ζBF = F ζA ◦ βF by the deﬁnition in Corollary 3.3(ii) and
the super interchange law.
(cid:3)

We need one more general notion, which we spell out below under the simplifying
assumption that our 2-categories are strict. The reader should have no trouble
interpreting this in the non-strict case; see Deﬁnition 1.14 from the introduction
where this is done when there is only one object. Our general conventions regarding
2-categories are analogous to the ones for 2-supercategories in Deﬁnition 2.2.

Deﬁnition 5.2. (i) A Π-2-category (A, π, β, ξ) is a k-linear 2-category A plus a
family π = (πλ) of 1-morphisms πλ : λ → λ, a family β = (βµ,λ) of natural
isomorphisms βµ,λ : πµ − ∼⇒ − πλ, and a family ξ = (ξλ) of 2-isomorphisms ξλ :
π2
λ

∼⇒ 1λ, such that (assuming A is strict):

• the pair (π, β) is an object in the Drinfeld center of A, i.e. the properties

from Lemma 3.2(i)–(ii) hold;

• (βλ,λ)πλ = −1π2
• ξµF ξ−1

λ

;

λ = (βµ,λ)F πλ ◦ πµ(βµ,λ)F in HomA(π2

µF, F π2

λ) for all 1-morphisms

F : λ → µ.

Using the second two of these properties, we get that ξµπµ = πµξµ in HomA(π3
µ, πµ).
Hence, each of the morphism categories HomA(λ, µ) in a Π-2-category is itself a
Π-category, with Π := πµ− and ξ := ξµ−.

(ii) A Π-2-functor between two Π-2-categories A and B is a k-linear 2-functor
R : A → B with its usual coherence maps c and i, plus an additional family of
∼⇒ Rπλ for each λ ∈ ob A, such that the following commute
2-isomorphisms j : πRλ
(assuming A and B are strict):

A Π-2-functor is strict if its coherence maps c, i and j are identities.

The basic example of a strict Π-2-category is Π-Cat: objects are Π-categories,
1-morphisms are Π-functors, and 2-morphisms are Π-natural transformations. We
deﬁne the additional data π, β and ξ so that πA := ΠA for each Π-category A, and
ξ and β come from the natural transformations of Deﬁnition 1.6(i)–(ii).

For a 2-supercategory A, the underlying 2-category A is the 2-category with the
same objects as A, morphism categories that are the underlying categories of the
morphism supercategories in A, and horizontal composition that is the restriction
of the one in A. If (A, π, ζ) is a (strict) Π-2-supercategory, Lemma 3.2 shows how
to deﬁne β and ξ making (A, π, β, ξ) into a Π-2-category. In particular, starting
from the Π-2-supercategory Π-SCat, we see that Π-SCat is a Π-2-category.

Now we upgrade the functors E1 and D1 from (5.1)–(5.2) to strict Π-2-functors

E1 : Π-SCat → Π-Cat,

D1 : Π-Cat → Π-SCat.

(5.3)

These agree with E1 and D1 on objects and 1-morphisms. On 2-morphisms, E1
sends an even supernatural transformation x : F ⇒ G to x : F ⇒ G deﬁned
from xλ := xλ, which is a Π-natural transformation thanks to Corollary 3.3(iii).
In the other direction, D1 sends a Π-natural transformation y : F ⇒ G to ˆy :
bF ⇒ bG deﬁned from ˆyλ := yλ. In order to check that ˆy is an even supernatural
transformation, the subtle point is to show that ˆyµ ◦ bF ˆf = bG ˆf ◦ ˆyλ for an odd
morphism ˆf : λ → µ coming from f : λ → ΠAµ in A, i.e. ΠByµ ◦ (βF )−1
µ ◦ F f =
(βG)−1
µ ◦ Gf ◦ yλ. This follows from the property βG ◦ ΠBy = yΠA ◦ βF from
Deﬁnition 1.6(iii), plus the fact that yΠAµ ◦ F f = Gf ◦ yλ by the naturality of
y. The following strengthens Lemma 5.1 by taking natural transformations into
account:

Theorem 5.3. The strict Π-2-functors D1 and E1 from (5.3) give mutually inverse
Π-2-equivalences between Π-Cat and Π-SCat.

Proof. We have that E1◦D1 = IΠ-Cat. Conversely, we show that D1◦E1 is isomorphic
(not merely equivalent!) to IΠ-SCat in the 2-category Π-SCat by producing a Π-2-
natural isomorphism

(T, t) : D1 ◦ E1

∼
⇒ IΠ-SCat.

Thus, we need to supply supercategory isomorphisms TA : d(A) ∼→ A and even
supernatural isomorphisms (tB,A)F : TBd(F ) ∼⇒ F TA for all Π-supercategories and

superfunctors F : A → B. The isomorphisms TA have already been deﬁned in the

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

25

proof of Lemma 5.1. Also, in the last paragraph of that proof, we observed that

TBd(F ) = F TA. So we can simply take each (tB,A)F to be the identity. To see that
tB,A is natural, one needs to observe that xTA = TB c(x) for all even supernatural
isomorphisms x : F ⇒ G. The only other non-trivial check required is for the
coherence axiom of Deﬁnition 5.2(iii). For this, we must show that (βA,d(A))TA is
the identity for each Π-supercategory A. This amounts to checking that the natural
transformations ζATA and TAζd(A) are equal. By deﬁnition, on an object λ, ζd(A)
is the odd morphism ˆ1ΠAλ : ΠAλ → λ in d(A) associated to the identity morphism
1ΠAλ. Hence, according to the deﬁnition from the ﬁrst paragraph of the proof of
Lemma 5.1, (TAζd(A))λ = TAˆ1ΠAλ = (ζA)λ = (ζATA)λ, as required.
(cid:3)

Recall that Π-2-SCat is the category of Π-2-supercategories and 2-superfunctors.
Also let Π-2-Cat denote the category of Π-2-categories and Π-2-functors. There is
a functor

E2 : Π-2-SCat → Π-2-Cat,

(A, π, ζ) 7→ (A, π, β, ξ), R 7→ R.

(5.4)

We’ve already deﬁned the eﬀect of this on Π-2-supercategories. On a 2-superfunctor
R : A → B, we deﬁne R to be the same function as R on objects and the underlying
functor to R on morphism categories. The coherence maps c and i restrict in an
obvious way to give coherence maps for R. We also need the additional coherence
map j : πRλ

∼⇒ Rπλ, which is deﬁned so that the following diagram commutes:

πRλ

ζRλ

1Rλ

j

i

Rπλ

.

Rζλ

R1λ

Now one has to check that the two axioms from Deﬁnition 5.2(ii) are satisﬁed. The
ﬁrst of these is a consequence of the second two diagrams from Deﬁnition 2.2(ii)
plus the deﬁnition of β. For the second one, we have by the super interchange law
that

((Rζλ)(Rζλ)) ◦ jj = ((Rζλ) ◦ j)((Rζλ) ◦ j) = (i ◦ ζRλ)(i ◦ ζRλ) = ii ◦ (ζRλζRλ).

Also, by the naturality of c, we have that R(ζλζλ) ◦ c = c ◦ ((Rζλ)(Rζλ)). Putting
these together gives R(ζλζλ) ◦ c ◦ jj = c ◦ ii ◦ (ζRλζRλ), and the conclusion follows
easily.

In the other direction, we deﬁne a functor

(A, π, β, ξ) 7→ (bA, π, ζ), R 7→ bR

(5.5)

D2 : Π-2-Cat → Π-2-SCat,

as follows. The 2-supercategory bA has the same objects as A. Its morphism su-
percategories Hom bA(λ, µ) arise as associated Π-supercategories to the morphism
categories HomA(λ, µ). Thus the 1-morphisms in bA are the same as in A, while
for 1-morphisms F, G : λ → µ we have that Hom bA(F, G)¯0 := HomA(F, G) and
Hom bA(F, G)¯1 := HomA(F, πµG). To describe horizontal and vertical composition
in bA, we assume to simplify the exposition that A is strict. Then vertical composi-
tion in bA is induced by that of A (using ξ when composing two odd 2-morphisms).
Horizontal composition of 1-morphisms in bA is the same as in A; the horizontal
F, H : λ → µ and G, K : µ → ν in bA is deﬁned as follows:

composition ˆy ˆx of homogeneous 2-morphisms ˆx : F ⇒ H and ˆy : G ⇒ K for

26

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

• if they are both even, so ˆx = x and ˆy = y for morphisms x : F ⇒ H and
y : G ⇒ K in A, we deﬁne ˆy ˆx to be the horizontal composition yx : GF ⇒
KH in A;

• if ˆx is even and ˆy is odd, so ˆx = x and ˆy = y for x : F ⇒ H and y : G ⇒ πν K
in A, we let ˆy ˆx be the horizontal composition yx : GF ⇒ πν KH in A viewed

• if ˆy is even and ˆx is odd, so ˆy = y and ˆx = x for x : F ⇒ πµH and

as an odd 2-morphism GF ⇒ KH in bA;
y : G ⇒ K, we let ˆy ˆx be (βν,µ)−1

K H ◦ yx : GF ⇒ KπµH ⇒ πν KH;

let ˆy ˆx be −ξνKH ◦ πν (βν,µ)−1

• if both are odd, so ˆx = x and ˆy = y for x : F ⇒ πµH and y : G ⇒ πν K, we
νKH ⇒ KH.
We leave it as an instructive exercise for the reader to check the super interchange
law using the axioms from Deﬁnition 5.2(i); see also [EL, (2.44)–(2.45)] for helpful

K H ◦ yx : GF ⇒ πνKπµH ⇒ π2

To complete the deﬁnition of D2, we still need to deﬁne the 2-superfunctor

pictures. To make bA into a Π-2-supercategory, we already have the required data
π = (πλ), and we get ζ = (ζλ) by deﬁning ζλ : πλ ⇒ 1λ to be 1πλ viewed as an odd
2-isomorphism in bA.
bR : bA → bB given a Π-2-functor R : A → B. For simplicity, we assume that A
and B are strict. Then bR is the same as R on objects and 1-morphisms. On an
even 2-morphism ˆx : F ⇒ G, coming from x : F ⇒ G in A, we let bRˆx be the even
coming from x : F ⇒ πµG, we let bRˆx be the odd 2-morphism associated to the
composition j−1(RG) ◦ c−1 ◦ Rx : RF ⇒ R(πµG) ⇒ (Rπµ)(RG) ⇒ πRµ(RG). We
take the coherence maps c and i for bR that are deﬁned by the same data as c and
• To see that bR is a well-deﬁned functor on morphism supercategories, one
needs to check that bR(ˆy ◦ ˆx) = bRˆy ◦ bRˆx for ˆx : F ⇒ G, ˆy : G ⇒ H and

2-morphism associated to Rx : RF ⇒ RG. On an odd 2-morphism ˆx : F ⇒ G,

i for R. As usual, there are various checks to be made:

F, G, H : λ → µ. This is immediate if ˆx is even.
If ˆx is odd, it comes
from some 2-morphism x : F ⇒ πµG in A. Suppose ˆy is even, coming from
y : G ⇒ H in A. Then we need to show that

j−1(RH) ◦ c−1 ◦ R(πµy) ◦ Rx = πRµ(Ry) ◦ j−1(RG) ◦ c−1 ◦ Rx.

This follows by the commutativity of the following hexagon of 2-morphisms
in B:

(Rπµ)(RG)

j(RG)

πRµ(RG)

πRµ(Ry)

(Rπµ)(Ry)

πRµ(RH)

j(RH)

(Rπµ)(RH)

c

c

R(πµG)

R(πµy)

.

R(πµH)

To see this, note the left hand square commutes by the interchange law,
and the right hand square commutes by naturality of c. The case that ˆy is
odd, coming from y : G ⇒ µµH, is similar but a little more complicated; ul-
timately, it depends on the second coherence axiom from Deﬁnition 5.2(ii).

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

27

• To see that c is a supernatural transformation, one needs to check that

(bRG)(bRF )

(bRˆy)(bRˆx)

(bRK)(bRH)

c

c

bR(GF )

bR(ˆy ˆx)

bR(KH)

commutes. We leave this lengthy calculation to the reader, just noting
when ˆx is odd that it depends also on the ﬁrst coherence axiom from Deﬁ-
nition 5.2(ii).

The proof of the next lemma is similar to the proof of Lemma 5.1. Note also that
the remaining part of Theorem 1.15 from the introduction follows from this result
(on restricting to 2-(super)categories with one object).

Lemma 5.4. The functors D2 and E2 are mutually inverse equivalences between
the categories Π-2-Cat and Π-2-SCat.
Proof. We ﬁrst observe that E2 ◦ D2 = IΠ-2-Cat. To show that D2 ◦ E2 ∼= IΠ-2-SCat,
∼⇒ IΠ-2-SCat. So for each Π-
we have to deﬁne a natural isomorphism T : D2 ◦ E2
2-supercategory (A, π, ζ), we need to produce an isomorphism of 2-supercategories

TA : d(A) ∼→ A. This is the identity on objects and 1-morphisms. On a homogeneous
2-morphism ˆx : F ⇒ G between 1-morphisms F, G : λ → µ in d(A), we let TA ˆx := x

if ˆx is even coming from x : F ⇒ G in A, or TA ˆx := ζµG ◦ x if ˆx is odd coming
from x : F ⇒ πµG in A. Since TA is clearly bijective on 2-morphisms, it will
certainly be a 2-isomorphism, but we still need to verify that it is indeed a well-
deﬁned 2-superfunctor, i.e. we need to show that it respects horizontal and vertical
composition of 2-morphisms. In the next paragraph, we go through the details of
this in the most interesting situation when both 2-morphisms are odd (also assuming
A is strict to simplify notation).

For vertical composition, take F, G, H : λ → µ and odd 2-morphisms ˆx : F ⇒ G,

ˆy : G ⇒ H in d(A) coming from x : F ⇒ πµG, y : G ⇒ πµH in A. The vertical
composition ˆy ◦ ˆx in d(A) is by deﬁnition the composition ξµH ◦ πµy ◦ x in A. We

need to show that this is equal to ζµH ◦ y ◦ ζµG ◦ x:

ζµH ◦ y ◦ ζµG ◦ x = −ζµH ◦ ζµπµH ◦ πµy ◦ x = ξµH ◦ πµy ◦ x.

For horizontal composition, take F, H : λ → µ, G, K : µ → ν and odd 2-morphisms
ˆx : F ⇒ H, ˆy : G ⇒ K coming from x : F ⇒ πµH, y : G ⇒ πνK. Recalling that
(βν,µ)−1
K =
ζνKζµ. We deduce that

ν Kζµ, we have that ζν K ◦ (βν,µ)−1

K = Kζµ, hence ξνK ◦ Πν(βν,µ)−1

K = ζ−1

−ξν KH ◦ Πν (βν,µ)−1

K H ◦ yx = −ζνKζµH ◦ yx = (ζν K ◦ y)(ζµH ◦ x),

establishing that Φ(ˆy ˆx) = Φ(ˆy)Φ(ˆx).

To complete the proof we need to check naturality: we have that RTA = TBd(R)

for each 2-superfunctor R : A → B between Π-2-supercategories A and B. The
only tricky point is to see that they are equal on an odd 2-morphism ˆx : F ⇒ G in

d(A) coming from x : F ⇒ πµG in A. For this, one needs to use the last of the unit

axioms from Deﬁnition 2.2(ii) plus the deﬁnition of j.

(cid:3)

Finally, we upgrade E2 and D2 to strict 2-functors

E2 : Π-2-SCat → Π-2-Cat,

D2 : Π-2-Cat → Π-2-SCat.

(5.6)

28

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

We take E2 to be equal to E2 on objects and 1-morphisms. On 2-morphisms,
E2 sends 2-natural transformation (X, x) : R ⇒ S to (X, x) : R ⇒ S deﬁned by
X λ := Xλ and xµ,λ := xµ,λ. To check the coherence axiom from Deﬁnition 5.2(iii),
we need to check that the outside square in the following diagram commutes:

πSλXλ

(βSλ,Rλ)Xλ

XλπRλ

ζSλXλ

XλζRλ

1SλXλ

(xλ,λ)πλ

(Sπλ)Xλ

Xλi

Xλ(R1λ)

Xλj

.

Xλ(Rζλ)

Xλ(Rπλ)

This follows because the other ﬁve faces commute: the middle square by Deﬁni-
tion 2.2(iii), the left and right squares by deﬁnition of j, the top square by deﬁnition
of β, and the bottom square by naturality of xλ,λ.

In the other direction, the strict 2-functor D2 is the same as D2 on objects
and 1-morphisms. It sends Π-2-natural transformation (Y, y) : R ⇒ S to (bY , ˆy) :
bR ⇒ bS deﬁned by bYλ := Yλ and ˆyµ,λ := yµ,λ. The content here is to check the

supernaturality of yµ,λ on an odd 2-morphism ˆx : F ⇒ G, so F, G are 1-morphisms
λ → µ and ˆx is the odd 2-morphism associated to a 2-morphism x : F ⇒ πµG. We

need to show that (bSˆx)bYλ ◦ (ˆyµ,λ)F = (ˆyµ,λ)G ◦ bYµ(bRˆx), which amounts to checking

the commutativity of the outside of the following diagram:

Yµ(RF )

Yµ(Rx)

Yµ(R(πµG))

Yµc−1

Yµ(Rπµ)(RG)

(yµ,λ)F

(yµ,λ)πµG

YµπRµ(RG)

(βSµ,Rµ)−1

πSµYµ(RG)

πSµ(yµ,λ)G

πSµ(SG)Yλ

Now we observe that the top square commutes by naturality of yµ,λ; the pentagon
commutes by the ﬁrst axiom from Deﬁnition 2.2(iii) (we are assuming strictness as
usual); the bottom left square commutes by the axiom from Deﬁnition 5.2(iii); and
the bottom right square commutes by the interchange law.

Theorem 5.5. The strict 2-functors D2 and E2 are mutually inverse 2-equivalences
between the strict 2-categories Π-2-Cat and Π-2-SCat.

Proof. This may be deduced from the proof of Lemma 5.4 in a similar way to how
Theorem 5.3 was obtained from the proof of Lemma 5.1. We leave the details to
the reader.
(cid:3)

Corollary 5.6. The 2-supercategories Π-2-SCat and Π-2-dCat are 2-superequivalent.

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

29

Proof. We’ve already shown in Theorem 5.3 that E1 : E2(Π-SCat) → Π-Cat is a
Π-2-equivalence. Now apply D2 and use Theorem 5.5.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.7. Like in Remark 4.9, one can go a level higher: the strict 3-category
of Π-2-categories, Π-2-functors, Π-2-natural transformations and modiﬁcations is
3-equivalent to the strict 3-category of Π-2-supercategories, 2-superfunctors, 2-
natural transformations and even supermodiﬁcations.
In particular, this asser-
tion implies that the monoidal category underlying the Drinfeld center of a Π-2-
supercategory A is monoidally equivalent to the Drinfeld center of A.

6. Gradings

In the ﬁnal section, we explain how to incorporate an additional Z-grading. Since
this is all is very similar to the theory so far (and there are no additional issues with
signs!), we will be quite brief, introducing suitable language but leaving detailed
proofs to the reader. We continue to assume that k is a commutative ground ring6,
so a superspace means a Z/2-graded k-module as before.

By a graded superspace we mean a Z-graded superspace

V = M

Vn = M

Vn,¯0 ⊕ Vn,¯1.

n∈Z

n∈Z

We stress that the Z- and Z/2-gradings on a graded superspace are independent
of each other. We denote the degree n of v ∈ Vn also by deg(v). Let GSVec be
the category of graded superspaces and degree-preserving even linear maps, i.e. k-
module homomorphisms f : V → W such that f (Vn,p) ⊆ Wn,p for each n ∈ Z and

p ∈ Z/2. This is a symmetric monoidal category with (V ⊗W )n = Lr+s=n Vr ⊗Ws,

and the same braiding as in SVec.

Deﬁnition 6.1. By a graded supercategory we mean a category enriched in GSVec.
A graded superfunctor between graded supercategories is a superfunctor that pre-
serves degrees of morphisms. A supernatural transformation x : F ⇒ G be-
tween graded superfunctors F and G is said to be homogeneous of degree n if
xλ : F λ → Gλ is of degree n for all objects λ. Let Hom(F, G)n denote the super-
space of all homogeneous supernatural transformations of degree n. Then a graded
supernatural transformation from F to G is an element of the graded superspace

Hom(F, G) := Ln∈Z Hom(F, G)n.

If A is a graded supercategory, the underlying category A is the k-linear category
with the same objects as A but only the even morphisms of degree zero. Here are
some basic examples of graded supercategories:

• Any graded superalgebra A = Ln∈Z An = Ln∈Z An,¯0 ⊕An,¯1 can be viewed

as a graded supercategory with one object.

• For graded superalgebras A and B, let A-GSMod-B denote the graded su-

percategory of graded (A, B)-superbimodules V = Ln∈Z Vn = Ln∈Z Vn,¯0 ⊕
Vn,¯1. Morphisms are deﬁned from Hom(V, W ) := Ln∈Z Hom(V, W )n where
Hom(V, W )n consists of all (A, B)-superbimodule homomorphisms f : V →
W that are homogeneous of degree n, i.e. f (Vm) ⊆ Wm+n for all m ∈ Z.

• Taking A = B = k in (ii), we get the graded supercategory GSVec of graded

superspaces. The underlying category is GSVec as deﬁned above.

6Actually, everything prior to Deﬁnition 6.10 makes sense more generally working over a graded
commutative superalgebra k = Ln∈Z kn = Ln∈Z kn,

¯0 ⊕ kn,

¯1.

30

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

• For graded supercategories A, B, the graded supercategory Hom(A, B) con-
sists of all graded superfunctors and graded supernatural transformations.
Let GSCat be the category of all graded supercategories and graded superfunc-
tors. We make GSCat into a monoidal category with tensor product operation
− ⊠ − deﬁned in just the same way as was explained after Example 1.2 in the
introduction.

Deﬁnition 6.2. A strict graded 2-supercategory is a category enriched in GSCat,
i.e.
it is a 2-supercategory with an additional grading on 2-morphisms which is
respected by both horizontal and vertical composition.

The basic example of a strict graded 2-supercategory is GSCat, consisting of
graded supercategories, graded superfunctors and graded supernatural transforma-
tions. There is also the more general weak notion of graded 2-supercategory, which
is the obvious graded analog of Deﬁnition 2.2. For example, there is a graded 2-
supercategory GSBim of graded superbimodules, which has objects that are graded
superalgebras, the morphism supercategories are deﬁned from HomGSBim(A, B) :=
B-GSMod-A, and horizontal composition deﬁned by tensor product.

The next two deﬁnitions give the graded analogs of Deﬁnitions 1.7 and 3.1.

Deﬁnition 6.3. A graded (Q, Π)-supercategory is a graded supercategory A plus
the extra data of graded superfunctors Q, Q−1, Π : A → A, an odd supernatural
isomorphism ζ : Π ∼⇒ I that is homogeneous of degree 0, and even supernatural
isomorphisms σ : Q ∼⇒ I and ¯σ : Q−1 ∼⇒ I that are homogeneous of degrees
−1 and 1, respectively. Note that ı := ¯σσ : Q−1Q ∼⇒ I,  := σ¯σ : QQ−1 ∼⇒ I
and ξ := ζζ : Π2 ∼
⇒ I are even isomorphisms of degree zero, so that Q and
Q−1 are mutually inverse graded superequivalences, and Π is a self-inverse graded
superequivalence.

For example, for graded superalgebras A and B, we can view A-GSMod-B as
a graded (Q, Π)-supercategory by deﬁning Π and ζ as in Example 1.8, and letting
Q, Q−1 : A-GSMod-B → A-GSMod-B be the upward and downward grading shift
functors, i.e. (QV )n := Vn−1, (Q−1V )n := Vn+1. We deﬁne σ, ¯σ to be the even
supernatural transformations induced by the identity function on the underlying
sets.

Deﬁnition 6.4. A graded (Q, Π)-2-supercategory is a graded 2-supercategory A
plus families q = (qλ : λ → λ), q−1 = (q−1
: λ → λ) and π = (πλ : λ → λ)
λ
∼⇒ 1λ) and
∼⇒ 1λ), ¯σ = (¯σλ : q−1
of 1-morphisms, and families σ = (σλ : qλ
∼⇒ 1λ) of 2-isomorphisms which are even, even and odd of degrees −1,
ζ = (ζλ : πλ
1 and 0, respectively.

λ

For example, there is a graded (Q, Π)-2-supercategory (Q, Π)-GSCat consisting
of all graded (Q, Π)-supercategories, graded superfunctors and graded supernatural
transformations.

Lemma 6.5. Let A be a graded (Q, Π)-2-supercategory, which we assume is strict
for simplicity.

(i) There are families β = (βµ,λ : πµ− ∼⇒ −πλ) of even supernatural isomor-
∼⇒ 1λ) of even 2-isomorphisms
phisms of degree zero and ξ = (ξλ : π2
λ
of degree zero deﬁned as in Lemma 3.2. They satisfy the properties from
Deﬁnition 5.2(i).

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

31

(ii) There is a family γ = (γµ,λ : qµ− ∼⇒ −qλ) of even supernatural isomor-
phisms of degree zero deﬁned from (γµ,λ)F := σµF σ−1
for a 1-morphism
λ
F : λ → µ. The pair (q, γ) is an invertible object of the Drinfeld center of
A with (γλ,λ)qλ = 1q2

and (γλ,λ)πλ = (βλ,λ)−1
qλ .

λ

(iii) There are even 2-isomorphisms of degree zero ıλ := ¯σλσλ : q−1

λ = q−1

λ qλ, qλ) and HomA(q−1

λ qλq−1

λ , q−1

λ ), respectively.

Proof. Similar arguments to those in the proof of Lemma 3.2.

(cid:3)

Corollary 6.6. Let A and A′ be graded (Q, Π)-supercategories.

(i) There are even supernatural isomorphisms of degree zero ξ := ζζ : Π2 ∼⇒ I,
ı := ¯σσ : Q−1Q ⇒ I and  := σ¯σ : QQ−1 ⇒ I. Moreover, we have that
ξΠ = Πξ, and ı−1 and  deﬁne the unit and counit of an adjunction making
(Q, Q−1) into an adjoint pair of auto-equivalences of A.

(ii) Suppose that F : A → A′ is a graded superfunctor. There are even su-
pernatural isomorphisms of degree zero βF := −ζ′F ζ−1 : Π′F ∼⇒ F Π and
γF := σ′F σ−1 : Q′F ∼⇒ F Q, with ξ′F ξ−1 = βF Π ◦ Π′βF as in Corol-
lary 3.3(ii). Also γΠ = β−1
Q .

(iii) Suppose that x : F ⇒ G is a graded supernatural transformation. Then
βG ◦ Π′x = xΠ ◦ βF as in Corollary 3.3(iii). Similarly, γG ◦ Q′x = xQ ◦ γG.
(iv) We have that βGF = GβF ◦ βGF, βI = 1Π and βΠ = −1Π2 as in Corol-

lary 3.3(iv). Similarly, γGF = GγF ◦ γGF, γI = 1Q and γQ = 1Q2.

Proof. Everything follows by applying Lemma 6.5 to the (Q, Π)-2-supercategory
(Q, Π)-GSCat. In particular, the assertion in (i) that ı−1 and  are the unit and
counit of an adjunction means that Qı−1 ◦ Q : Q ⇒ QQ−1Q ⇒ Q and ı−1Q−1 ◦
Q−1 : Q−1 ⇒ Q−1QQ−1 ⇒ Q−1 are identities; this follows because Qı = Q and
ıQ−1 = Q−1.
(cid:3)

The analog of Deﬁnition 1.10 in the presence of a grading is as follows.

Deﬁnition 6.7. The (Q, Π)-envelope of a graded supercategory A is the graded
(Q, Π)-supercategory Aq,π with objects {QmΠaλ | λ ∈ ob A, m ∈ Z, a ∈ Z/2} and

HomAq,π (QmΠaλ, QnΠbµ) := Qn−mΠa+b HomA(λ, µ),

where Q and Π on the right hand side are the (invertible) grading and parity shift
functors on GSVec. We denote the morphism QmΠaλ → QnΠbµ coming from a
homogeneous f : λ → µ under this identiﬁcation by f n,b
m,a. Composition in Aq,π
is deﬁned by gn,c

Q(QmΠaλ) := Qm+1Πaλ, Q−1(QmΠaλ) := Qm−1Πaλ, and σ, ¯σ are induced by the
identity morphism in A.

In an analogous way to (4.1), Deﬁnition 6.7 may be extended to produce a strict

graded 2-superfunctor

−q,π : GSCat → (Q, Π)-GSCat.

(6.1)

There is a canonical graded superfunctor J : A → Aq,π which satisﬁes a universal
property similar to Lemma 4.2. Also J is a graded superequivalence if and only

32

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

if every object λ of A is the source of an even isomorphism of degree 1 and an
odd isomorphism of degree 0; cf. Lemma 4.1. Using this, one obtains the following
analog of Theorem 4.3:

Theorem 6.8. For all graded supercategories A and graded (Q, Π)-supercategories
B, there is a functorial graded superequivalence Hom(A, νB) → Hom(Aq,π, B),
where ν : (Q, Π)-GSCat → GSCat denotes the obvious forgetful 2-superfunctor.
Hence, the strict graded 2-superfunctor −q,π is left 2-adjoint to ν.

Moving on to 2-categories, here is the graded analog of Deﬁnition 4.4:

Deﬁnition 6.9. The (Q, Π)-envelope of a graded 2-supercategory A is the (Q, Π)-
2-supercategory Aq,π with the same object set as A and morphism supercategories
that are the (Q, Π)-envelopes of the graded morphism supercategories in A. Thus,
the set of 1-morphisms λ → µ in Aq,π is

{QmΠaF | for all 1-morphisms F : λ → µ in A, m ∈ Z and a ∈ Z/2}.

The graded superspace of 2-morphisms QmΠaF ⇒ QnΠbG in Aq,π is deﬁned from

HomAq,π (QmΠaF, QnΠbG) := Qn−mΠa+b HomA(F, G).

We denote the 2-morphism QmΠaF ⇒ QnΠbG coming from a homogeneous 2-
morphism x : F ⇒ G in A under this identiﬁcation by xn,b
m,a. In the strict case, one
might represent xn,b

m,a diagrammatically by

This is of parity |x| + a + b and degree deg(x) + n − m (where |x| and deg(x) denote
the parity and degree of x in A). Vertical composition is deﬁned from

l,a := (y ◦ x)n,c
l,a .
Horizontal composition of 1-morphisms is deﬁned by

yn,c
m,b ◦ xm,b

(QnΠbG)(QmΠaF ) := Qm+nΠa+b(GF )

and 2-morphisms by

yl,d
n,bxk,c

m,a := (−1)(|x|+a+c)b+c|y|(yx)k+l,c+d

m+n,a+b.

Finally, q, q−1 and π are given by qλ := Q1
2-morphisms σλ, ¯σλ and ξλ are induced by 11λ.

Like in (4.4), one can extend Deﬁnition 6.9 to obtain a strict 2-functor

−q,π : 2-GSCat → (Q, Π)-2-GSCat.

(6.2)

Then there is an obvious analog of Theorem 4.8 showing that this is left 2-adjoint
to the forgetful functor. We leave the details here to the reader.

Next, we explain the graded analogs of Deﬁnitions 1.6 and 5.2, and extend the
results of Section 5. The following is an eﬃcient formulation of the general notion
of a strict action of the group Z ⊕ Z/2 on a k-linear category.

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

33

Deﬁnition 6.10. (i) A (Q, Π)-category is a k-linear category A equipped with the
following additional data: an endofunctor Π : A → A and a natural isomorphism
ξ : Π2 ∼⇒ I such that ξΠ = Πξ in Hom(Π3, Π); endofunctors Q, Q−1 : A → A and
natural isomorphisms ı : Q−1Q ∼⇒ I,  : QQ−1 ∼⇒ I so that ı−1 and  deﬁne a unit
and a counit making (Q, Q−1) into an adjoint pair of auto-equivalences; a natural
isomorphism βQ : ΠQ ∼⇒ QΠ such that ξQξ−1 = βQΠ ◦ ΠβQ in Hom(Π2Q, QΠ2).
(ii) Given (Q, Π)-categories A and A′, a (Q, Π)-functor F : A → A′ is a k-
linear functor with the additional data of natural isomorphisms βF : Π′F ∼⇒ F Π
and γF : Q′F ∼⇒ F Q such that ξ′F ξ−1 = βF Π ◦ Π′βF in Hom((Π′)2F, F Π2). For
example, I, Π and Q are (Q, Π)-functors with βI := 1Π, βΠ := −1Π2, βQ as speciﬁed
in (i), γI := 1Q, γΠ := β−1

Q and γQ := 1Q2 .

(iii) Given (Q, Π)-functors F, G : A → A′, a (Q, Π)-natural transformation is a
natural transformation x : F ⇒ G such that xΠ ◦ βF = βG ◦ Π′x and xQ ◦ γF =
γG ◦ Q′x.

There is a 2-category (Q, Π)-Cat consisting of (Q, Π)-categories, (Q, Π)-functors
and (Q, Π)-natural transformations. We want to compare this to (Q, Π)-GSCat,
the 2-category of graded (Q, Π)-supercategories, graded superfunctors and homo-
geneous even supernatural transformations of degree zero. Like in (5.3), there is a
strict 2-functor

E : (Q, Π)-GSCat → (Q, Π)-Cat

(6.3)
sending a graded (Q, Π)-supercategory A to the underlying category A, which is a
(Q, Π)-category thanks to Corollary 6.6(i). It sends a graded superfunctor F : A →
B to the restriction F : A → B, made into a (Q, Π)-functor as in Corollary 6.6(ii).
It sends a homogeneous graded supernatural transformation x : F ⇒ G of degree
zero to x : F ⇒ G deﬁned from xλ := xλ, which is a (Q, Π)-natural transformation
thanks to Corollary 6.6(iii).

Theorem 6.11. The 2-functor E from (6.3) is a 2-equivalence of 2-categories.

Theorem 6.11 is proved in a similar way to Theorem 5.3. The key point of course
is to deﬁne the appropriate strict 2-functor D in the opposite direction. We just go
brieﬂy through the deﬁnition of this, since there are a few subtleties. So let A be
a (Q, Π)-category. Let Qn := Q · · · Q (n times) if n ≥ 0 or Q−1 · · · Q−1 (−n times)
if n ≤ 0. Given any composition C of r of the functors Q and s of the functors
Q−1 (in any order), there is an isomorphism c : C ∼⇒ Qr−s deﬁned by repeatedly
applying ı and  to cancel Q−1Q- or QQ−1-pairs. The isomorphism c is independent
of the particular order chosen for these cancellations. In particular, we obtain in
this way a canonical isomorphism cm,n : QmQn ∼⇒ Qm+n for any m, n ∈ Z, and
deduce that

cl,m+n ◦ Qlcm,n = cl+m,n ◦ cl,mQn

(6.4)
in Hom(QlQmQn, Ql+m+n). Next, let F : A → A′ be a (Q, Π)-functor between two
F : (Q′)nF ∼⇒ F Qn
(Q, Π)-categories. For each n ∈ Z, we deﬁne an isomorphism γn
as follows: set γ0

F := 1F ; then for n ≥ 1 recursively deﬁne

Q ◦ (Q′)n−1γF ,

F := γ(n−1)
γn
γ−n
F := γ1−n
One can show that

in Hom((Q′)m(Q′)nF, F Qm+n). In particular, taking F := Π : A → A, this gives
Π : QnΠ ∼⇒ ΠQn; let βQn : ΠQn ∼⇒ QnΠ be its inverse. This
us an isomorphism γn
n,1 ◦ c1,n : QQn ∼⇒ QnQ makes Qn into a (Q, Π)-functor, i.e.
together with γQn := c−1
we have that

ξQn = Qnξ ◦ βQn Π ◦ ΠβQn .

We note also that

cm,nΠ ◦ βQm+n = QmβQn ◦ βQmQn ◦ Πcm,n.

(6.6)

(6.7)

Now, for a (Q, Π)-category A, we are ready to deﬁne the associated graded (Q, Π)-

supercategory bA. It has the same objects as A, and morphisms Hom bA(λ, µ)m,a :=
HomA(λ, QmΠaµ). The composition ˆg ◦ ˆf of ˆf , ˆg coming from f : λ → QmΠaµ, g :
µ → QnΠbν, respectively, is obtained from (QmΠag)◦f : λ → QmΠaQnΠbν by ﬁrst
using βQn to commute Qn past Πa if necessary, then using ξ and cm,n to simplify
QmQnΠaΠbν to Qm+nΠa+bν. The check that this is associative uses (6.4), (6.6)–
(6.7) and the identity ξΠ = Πξ. For a (Q, Π)-functor F : A → A′, we get bF :
bA → bA′ by composing F f : F λ → F QmΠaµ with the map F QmΠaµ → QmΠaF µ
F . The check that bF (ˆg ◦ ˆf ) = (bF ˆg) ◦ (bF ˆf ) uses (6.5). In
obtained using βF and γn
particular, since Π, Q and Q−1 are all (Q, Π)-functors, this gives us the functors
bΠ, bQ and bQ−1 needed to make bC into a graded (Q, Π)-supercategory.

Deﬁnition 6.12. A (Q, Π)-2-category is a k-linear 2-category A plus families π =
(πλ : λ → λ), q = (qλ : λ → λ) and q−1 = (q−1
: λ → λ) of 1-morphisms, families

The story here continues just as it did for Π-2-supercategories and Π-2-categories.
For a graded (Q, Π)-2-supercategory A, its underlying 2-category A, consisting of
the same objects and 1-morphisms but just the even 2-morphisms of degree zero, is
a (Q, Π)-2-category. Conversely, for a (Q, Π)-2-category A, there is a construction

of its associated graded (Q, Π)-2-supercategory bA, which we leave to the reader.
The constructions A 7→ A and A 7→ bA are mutual inverses (up to isomorphism), so

that (Q, Π)-2-categories and graded (Q, Π)-2-supercategories are equivalent notions.
Again, we leave it to the reader to formalize this statement by writing down the
appropriate analog of Theorem 5.5.

Finally, we discuss Grothendieck groups/rings in the graded setting:

• For a graded supercategory A, let GSKar(A) denote Kar(Aq,π), that is,
the additive Karoubi envelope of the underlying category to the (Q, Π)-
envelope of A. This is a (Q, Π)-category that is additive and idempotent
Its Grothendieck group K0(GSKar(A)) is a Zπ[q, q−1]-module
complete.
with π acting as [Π] and q acting as [Q].

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

35

• For a graded 2-supercategory A, let GSKar(A) := Kar(Aq,π) denote the
additive Karoubi envelope of the (Q, Π)-2-category underlying the (Q, Π)-
envelope of A. It is an additive, idempotent complete (Q, Π)-2-category.
Its Grothendieck ring K0(GSKar(A)) is naturally a locally unital ring with
a disinguished system of mutually orthogonal idempotents {1λ | λ ∈ ob A}.
Moreover this ring is actually a Zπ[q, q−1]-algebra with π and q acting on
1µK0(GSKar(A))1λ by left multiplication by [πµ] and [qµ] (equivalently,
right multiplication by [πλ] and [qλ]), respectively.

This construction will be used in particular in [BE] in order to pass from the Kac-
Moody 2-supercategory U(g) introduced there to the modiﬁed integral form of the
corresponding covering quantum group Uq,π(g) as in [C].

Appendix A. Odd Temperley-Lieb

In this appendix, we prove Theorem 1.18. Throughout we let ε := −1. If instead
one takes ε := +1 and works in the purely even setting, replacing the quantum
superalgebra ˙Uq(osp1|2) with the quantum algebra ˙Uq(sl2), the arguments below
may be used to recover the classical result for the Temperley-Lieb category T L(δ).
We assume some familiarity with the combinatorics from that story; e.g. see [W].
Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic diﬀerent from 2, and q ∈ k× be a scalar that
is not a root of unity. For any n ∈ Z, let [n] denote qn−(εq)−n
. For n ∈ N,
the element [n] is the same as [n]q,ε from (1.9), and [−n] = −εn[n]. Also set
δ := −[2] = −(q + εq−1). Recall that ST L(δ) is the strict monoidal supercategory
with one generating object · and two odd generating morphisms
, subject
to the following relations:

q−εq−1

and

= ,

= ε ,

= δ.

We denote the n-fold tensor product of the generating object · by n and its identity
endomorphism by en.

Using the string calculus, any crossingless matching connecting m points on
the bottom boundary and n points on the top boundary can be interpreted as
a morphism m → n in ST L(δ).
In view of the super interchange law, isotopic
crossingless matchings produce the same morphism up to a sign. Moreover, to get
a spanning set for HomST L(δ)(m, n), one just has to pick a system of representatives
for the isotopy classes of crossingless matchings. Our ﬁrst claim is that any such
spanning set is actually a basis for HomST L(δ)(m, n). For example, this assertion
implies that HomST L(δ)(3, 3) is of dimension 5 (the third Catalan number) with
basis

,

,

,

,

.

To prove it, we construct an explicit representation of ST L(δ).

Lemma A.1. Let V be the vector superspace on basis v1, v−1, where v1 is even
and v−1 is odd. There is a monoidal superfunctor G : ST L(δ) → SVec with
G(n) = V ⊗n and

G(cid:0)
G(cid:0)

(cid:1) : k → V ⊗ V,
(cid:1) : V ⊗ V → k,

1 7→ v−1 ⊗ v1 − qv1 ⊗ v−1;

v1 ⊗ v1 7→ 0,

v1 ⊗ v−1 7→ 1,

36

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

v−1 ⊗ v1 7→ −εq−1,

v−1 ⊗ v−1 7→ 0.

Proof. Check the three relations.

(cid:3)

Theorem A.2. Any set of representatives for the isotopy classes of crossingless
matchings from m points to n points deﬁnes a basis for HomST L(δ)(m, n).

Proof. We just need to prove linear independence. There is a linear map

HomST L(δ)(m, n) → HomST L(δ)(m + n, 0),

f 7→ cn ◦ (f ⊗ en),

where cn ∈ HomST L(δ)(2n, 0) is the morphism deﬁned by n nested caps. Using this,
one reduces to proving the result in the special case that m is even and n = 0, i.e.
our crossingless matchings consist of m/2 caps. Let S be a set of representatives
for such matchings. For s ∈ S, let θs : V ⊗m → k be the linear map obtained
by applying the monoidal superfunctor G from Lemma A.1 to the morphism in
ST L(δ) that is deﬁned by s. It suﬃces to show that the linear maps {θs | s ∈ S}
are linearly independent.

By writing +1 underneath the left hand vertex and −1 underneath the right
hand vertex of each cap of s ∈ S then reading oﬀ the resulting sequence, we obtain
a function from S to the set of Dyck sequences (s1, . . . , sm) with s1, . . . , sm ∈ {±1}
and s1 + · · · + sk ≥ 0 for each k = 1, . . . , m. As s can be recovered uniquely (up to
isotopy) from its Dyck sequence, the vectors {vs := vs1 ⊗· · ·⊗vsm ∈ V ⊗m|s ∈ S} are
linearly independent. Finally, we observe that θs(vs) = ±1 and θs(vt) = 0 unless
t ≤ s, where ≤ is the partial order deﬁned by s ≤ t if and only if the corresponding
Dyck sequences satisfy s1 + · · · + sk ≤ t1 + · · · + tk for each k = 1, . . . , m. The
required linear independence follows.
(cid:3)

Now we can prove Theorem 1.18:

Theorem A.3. For δ as above, SKar(ST L(δ)) is a semisimple Abelian category.
Moreover, as a based ring, K0(SKar(ST L(δ))) is isomorphic to the subring of

Zπ[x, x−1] with basis (cid:8)[n + 1]x,π, π[n + 1]x,π (cid:12)(cid:12) n ∈ N(cid:9).

Proof. We begin by deﬁning super analogs of the Jones-Wenzl projectors

fn = n

∈ EndST L(δ)(n).

These are deﬁned recursively by setting f0 := 1 and

n+1

.

Clearly, fn is equal to en plus a linear combination of diagrams with at least one
cup and cap. Hence, using Theorem A.2, fn is non-zero. By (1.10), we have that
[n][2] = [n + 1] + ε[n − 1]. Using this, an easy but crucial inductive calculation
shows that

···
n

and each fn is an idempotent. Moreover, one gets zero if one vertically composes
fn on top (resp. bottom) with any diagram involving a cap (resp. a cup).

MONOIDAL SUPERCATEGORIES

37

To prove the semisimplicity, we ﬁnd it convenient to replace the supercategory

ST L(δ) with the superalgebra

A := M

m,n∈N

HomST L(δ)(m, n),

whose multiplication is induced by composition in ST L(δ). Note that A is a locally
unital superalgebra with distinguished idempotents {en | n ∈ N}. Moreover, it is
locally ﬁnite dimensional in the sense that each enAem is a ﬁnite-dimensional super-
space. Consider the Π-supercategory SMod-A consisting of right A-supermodules

V which are themselves locally unital in the sense that V = Ln∈N V en. Like in

Example 1.17(i), there is an equivalence between SKar(ST L(δ)) and the full subcat-
egory of SMod-A consisting of all ﬁnitely generated projective supermodules. Thus,
we are reduced to working in SMod-A. Let P (n) := fnA, which is a projective su-
permodule. Let L be any irreducible A-supermodule. Let n ∈ N be minimal such
that Len 6= 0. The minimality of n ensures that any basis element of A with a cup in
its diagram acts as zero on Len. We deduce that HomA(P (n), L) ∼= Lfn = Len 6= 0,
demonstrating that L is a quotient of P (n) or ΠP (n). Moreover, EndA(P (n)) =
fnAfn ∼= k, so P (n) is indecomposable; equivalently, fn is a primitive idempotent.
Also for m 6= n, we have that HomA(P (m), P (n)) = fnAfm = 0. These observa-
tions together imply that every A-supermodule is completely reducible, and each
irreducible A-supermodule is evenly isomorphic to a unique one of the supermodules
{P (n), ΠP (n) | n ∈ N}, which are themselves irreducible.

The previous paragraph implies that SKar(ST L(δ)) is a semisimple Abelian
category. Moreover, we get a basis for K0(SKar(ST L(δ))) by taking the iso-
morphism classes in SKar(ST L(δ)) corresponding to the primitive idempotents

¯1 (cid:12)(cid:12) n ∈ N(cid:9). Thus, we can identify K0(SKar(ST L(δ))) with the ring in

(cid:8)(fn)¯0
the statement of the theorem using the correspondence (fn)¯0
¯0 ↔ [n + 1]x,π and
(fn)¯1
¯1 ↔ π[n + 1]x,π. To complete the proof of the theorem, it remains to check that
the ring structures agree. Since [n]x,π[2]x,π = [n + 1]x,π + π[n − 1]x,π by (1.10), we
must show that the idempotents (fn−1)¯0
¯1 are equivalent
¯0 + (gn)¯0
for each n ≥ 2. We have that (fn−1)¯0
¯0 where

¯0 + (fn−2)¯1
¯0 = (fn)¯0

¯0 = (fn−1 ⊗ f1)¯0

¯0 and (fn)¯0

¯0 ⊗ (f1)¯0

¯0, (fn)¯1

¯0 ⊗ (f1)¯0

gn := −

[n − 1]

[n]

···

n−1

···

n−1

···

.

Using the properties from the ﬁrst paragraph of the proof, we have that gn ◦gn = gn
and gn ◦ fn = fn ◦ gn = 0, so (fn)¯0
¯0 are orthogonal idempotents. It just
remains to observe that

¯0 and (gn)¯0

un := −

[n − 1]

[n]

···

n−1

···

···
vn := n−1
···

are odd morphisms in ST L(δ) such that un ◦ vn = gn and vn ◦ un = fn−2. Hence,
we get that (vn)¯1
¯1 in
SKar(ST L(δ)), as required.
(cid:3)

¯0 is equivalent to (fn−2)¯1

¯1, i.e. (gn)¯0

¯1 = (fn−2)¯1

¯0 ◦ (un)¯0

¯0 ◦ (gn)¯0

To explain what is really going on here, assume ﬁnally that the ground ﬁeld
k is of characteristic zero. Let U = ˙Uq(osp1|2) be the locally unital superalgebra

38

J. BRUNDAN AND A. ELLIS

with homogeneous distinguished idempotents {1n | n ∈ Z} and odd generators
En ∈ 1n+2U 1n and Fn ∈ 1n−2U 1n, subject to the relations

En−2Fn − εFn+2En = [n]1n.

This is the idempotented form of the quantum supergroup Uq(osp1|2) introduced in
[CW]. Let C be the Π-supercategory of all ﬁnite-dimensional left U -supermodules V
which are locally unital in the sense that V = Ln∈Z 1nV . By [CW], the underlying

Π-category C is a semisimple Abelian category, and a complete set of pairwise
inequivalent irreducible objects is given by {V (n), ΠV (n) | n ∈ N}, where V (n) is
deﬁned as follows. It has a homogeneous basis vn, vn−2, . . . , v−n with |vi| = (n−i)/2
(mod 2). We have that 1ivi = vi. The appropriate E’s and F ’s act on the basis by
the following scalars:

E : vn

[n]
←− vn−2

[n−1]
←− · · ·

[2]
←− v2−n

[1]
←− v−n,

F : vn

[1]
−→ vn−2

ε[2]
−→ vn−4

[3]
−→ · · ·

εn−1[n]

−→ v−n.

For example: (En−2Fn − εFn+2En)vn = En−2vn−2 = [n]vn.

We wish next to make U into a Hopf superalgebra by introducing a comultipli-

cation ∆ and counit ε deﬁned on generators by the following:

∆(1n) = X

1a ⊗ 1b,

a+b=n

ε(1n) = δn,01,

∆(En) = X

a+b=n

∆(Fn) = X

a+b=n

(Ea ⊗ 1b + q−a1a ⊗ Eb),

ε(En) = 0,

(εa1a ⊗ Fb + qbFa ⊗ 1b),

ε(Fn) = 0.

However, some of these formulae involve inﬁnite sums, so don’t make sense yet: we

with distinguished idempotents indexed by some set X, we can form the completion

are only ﬁnitely many y with axy 6= 0, and for each y there are only ﬁnitely many

need some completions! If A = Lx,y∈X 1xA1y is any locally unital (super)algebra
bA consisting of all elements (axy)x,y∈X ∈ Qx,y∈X 1xA1y such that for each x there
x with axy = 0. Clearly the multiplication on A extends to bA to make it into a
(super)algebra with 1 = Px∈X 1x. Applying this construction to U , we get the
completion bU ; applying it to the superalgebra U ⊗ U , which is locally unital with
distinguished idempotents {1m ⊗ 1n | m, n ∈ Z}, we get \U ⊗ U ; the triple tensor
product U ⊗ U ⊗ U may be completed similarly. Now the formulae above extend

satisfying completed versions of the usual coassociativitiy and counit axioms. This

canonically to deﬁne superalgebra homomorphisms ∆ : bU → \U ⊗ U and ε : bU → k,
makes bU into a Hopf superalgebra in a completed sense. (We remark there are

several other possible choices of coproduct here; see [C, §2.4].)

Given V, W ∈ ob C, the tensor product V ⊗ W is naturally a U ⊗ U -supermodule.
Since it is ﬁnite dimensional, it is a \U ⊗ U -supermodule too, hence using ∆ we
can view it as a U -supermodule. This makes C into a monoidal Π-supercategory

equipped with a ﬁber functor ν : C → SVec, namely, the obvious forgetful super-
functor. Setting V := V (1), we also have the monoidal superfunctor G : ST L(δ) →

maps deﬁned in Lemma A.1 are U -supermodule homomorphisms. This proves the
existence and uniqueness of F .

The proof of Theorem A.2 shows that F is faithful. Hence, so is the induced func-
tor ˜F : SKar(ST L(δ)) → C. Both SKar(ST L(δ)) and C are semisimple Abelian.
So, to prove that ˜F is an equivalence, we just need to show that the induced
Zπ-algebra homomorphism K0(SKar(ST L(δ))) → K0(C) sends the canonical basis
coming from the classes of irreducibles in SKar(ST L(δ)) to that of C.

In view of Theorem A.3, we may identify K0(SKar(ST L(δ)) with the subring
of Zπ[x, x−1] having canonical basis {[n + 1]x,π, π[n + 1]x,π | n ∈ N}. Note this is
generated as a Zπ-algebra just by [2]x,π, which corresponds to the object 1 in
ST L(δ). To understand K0(C), consider the map sending a ﬁnite-dimensional U -
supermodule M to its supercharacter

SCh M := X

(dim(1nM )¯0xn + dim(1nM )¯1πxn) ∈ Zπ[x, x−1].

n∈Z

We have that SCh V (n) = [n+1]x,π. Hence, SCh induces a Zπ-algebra isomorphism
between K0(C) and the same based subring of Zπ[x, x−1] as K0(SKar(ST L(δ))).
Moreover, the generator [2]x,π is the supercharacter of V . It remains to observe
that F (1) = V .
(cid:3)

Corollary A.5. The irreducible U -supermodule V (n) is isomorphic to the image
of the idempotent F (fn) ∈ EndU (V ⊗n), where fn is the Jones-Wenzl projector from
the proof of Theorem A.3.
