Abstract

In the composite Higgs models, originally proposed by Georgi and Kaplan, the Higgs boson is

a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) of spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry. In the

minimal version of such models, global SO(5) symmetry is spontaneously broken to SO(4), and

the pNGBs form an isospin doublet ﬁeld, which corresponds to the Higgs doublet in the Standard

Model (SM). Predicted coupling constants of the Higgs boson can in general deviate from the SM

predictions, depending on the compositeness parameter. The deviation pattern is determined also

by the detail of the matter sector. We comprehensively study how the model can be tested via

measuring single and double production processes of the Higgs boson at LHC and future electron-

positron colliders. The possibility to distinguish the matter sector among the minimal composite

Higgs models is also discussed. In addition, we point out diﬀerences in the cross section of double

Higgs boson production from the prediction in other new physics models.

INTRODUCTION

By measurements of the Higgs boson property at the LHC Run-I[1, 2], it has been found

that the Standard Model (SM), including the sector of electroweak symmetry breaking, is

surely a good description of the physics at the electroweak scale. However the essence of the

Higgs boson has not been understood yet, and it is worth asking whether the Higgs boson

is really an elementary scalar or a composite state of more fundamental ﬁelds.

Although the idea of the Higgs boson as an elementary scalar ﬁeld may be justiﬁed in

the framework of supersymmetry (SUSY) at the TeV scale, predicted superpartner particles

have not been discovered up to now at LHC. In this situation, motivation for a scenario of

the Higgs boson as a composite state becomes stronger.

In particular, with the measured mass of the Higgs boson to be 125 GeV, it is interesting

to consider the scenario originally proposed by Gerogi and Kaplan[3], where the Higgs boson

is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a global

symmetry above the TeV scale. Models based on this idea are called as composite Higgs

models, which draw a lot of attention recently[4, 5].

The minimal composite Higgs model (MCHM)[4] is known as a minimal realisation of
the composite Higgs models, where the approximate global symmetry SO(5)× U(1)X is
spontaneously broken into SO(4)×U(1)X at the scale f . Associated with the symmetry
breaking, four pNGBs appear, which are identiﬁed as the four component ﬁelds in the Higgs

doublet of the SM. There are several attempts to probe the MCHMs by phenomenological

study at the present and future collider experiments[7–12].

The induced Higgs potential depends on which representations of SO(5) the matter

fermions are embedded into. The Higgs boson couplings with the matter fermions such

as Yukawa couplings are also determined by the representations of the matter fermions. In

the literature, diﬀerent patterns of the deviations of the coupling constants from the SM

predictions are shown in diﬀerent MCHMs[8, 9]. Therefore, measuring the deviation pattern

at collider experiments is critical to distinguish a variety of the MCHMs.

In this paper, we investigate collider phenomenology of the MCHMs. Because of the

deviations of the Higgs boson couplings from the SM prediction, the production cross section

and the branching ratios of the Higgs boson are diﬀerent from those in the SM. We ﬁrst

clarify the constraint on the compositeness parameter in the MCHMs at the LHC Run-I. We

2

then discuss double Higgs boson production at LHC and future electron-positron colliders,

taking into account the constraint.

At the LHC Run-I, single Higgs boson production has been measured in various decay

modes, and no signiﬁcant deviation from the SM has been detected yet. In the literature[13],

the constraint on the compositeness parameter is obtained in the case of the universal

scale factors for the Yukawa couplings.

In models with non-universal scale factors, the

constraint should be extracted from the signal strength of individual production and decay

mode measured at the LHC Run-I[2].

With taking into account the constraint, we evaluate cross sections of double Higgs boson

production at LHC with the collision energy of 14 TeV in several MCHMs, and discuss

the possibility to distinguish among diﬀerent MCHMs. The search for double Higgs boson

production process at LHC can access to the coupling deviation which does not contribute to

the single Higgs boson production. While there have already been several phenomenological

studies of the double Higgs boson production at LHC in the context of MCHMs[10], we here

study the process from the viewpoint of the discrimination of the matter sector in various

MCHMs.

The double Higgs boson production process at future electron-positron colliders such as

the International Linear Collider (ILC)[14] and the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC)[15] can

give complementary information of the new physics. At the electron-positron colliders, the

double Higgs boson production cross section can be measured as a function of the collision

energy.

It is known that the production cross section has a speciﬁc energy dependence

on new physics models[16]. We estimate production cross sections for double Higgs boson

production processes in MCHMs, and show their energy dependences.

This article is organised as follows. In Sec. II, we give a brief review of the framework of

the MCHM. We introduce three diﬀerent MCHMs as benchmark models, and list deviation

patterns in Higgs boson coupling constants from the SM predictions and decay branching

ratios of the Higgs boson. In Sec. III, we show the present bound on the model parameter

from the LHC Run-I data, and we discuss the double Higgs boson production process at

LHC and a future electron-positron collider experiment. Summary and conclusion are shown

in Sec. IV.

II. HIGGS BOSON COUPLINGS IN VARIOUS MCHMS

In this section, we give a brief review on the MCHM for self consistency.

In the

MCHM[4, 5], four components of the SM-like Higgs boson doublet are identiﬁed with the
four pNGBs associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking of SO(5) × U(1)X →
SO(4) × U(1)X. The low energy eﬀective Lagrangian can be constructed by utilising a non-
linear representation of the global symmetry group. Since SU(2)L× U(1)Y in SO(4)× U(1)X
is gauged, the global symmetry is explicitly broken by the gauge couplings. The matter

fermions in the SM by themselves cannot consist SO(5) multiplet. They should be embed-

ded into SO(5) representations, and the components of the multiplets other than the SM

fermions are decoupled from the eﬀective theory. The Yukawa coupling with the matter

fermions of the SM also explicitly breaks the global SO(5) symmetry. Due to these explicit

breaking eﬀects of the global symmetry, the Higgs potential is eﬀectively generated via the

loop contributions of weak gauge bosons and the SM fermions. The SM fermion contri-

bution V fermion

eﬀ

strongly depends on how the SM fermion ﬁelds are embedded into SO(5)

multiplets. The detail of the model dependence of the Higgs potential in the MCHMs are

given in Ref. [8, 9]. By solving the stationary condition, the Higgs ﬁeld can have non-zero

vacuum expectation value (VEV).

We summarise deviations in the Higgs boson couplings from the SM predictions in the

diﬀerent MCHMs. In order to describe the deviation pattern in each MCHM, it is convenient
to use the scale factors κa, which are deﬁned by κa ≡ ga/gSM
constants of the Higgs boson coupling with the weak gauge bosons V = W and Z, matter

a , where ga denote the coupling

fermions and the Higgs boson itself as a = hV V , htt, hbb, and hhh. For κhV V , κhtt and

κhbb, we simply write κV , κt and κb, respectively. For hhV V couplings, we introduce the

parameter chhV V = ghhV V /gSM
hhV V . In the eﬀective theories of the MCHMs, new dimension ﬁve
operators of two Higgs bosons and two fermions such as hht¯t are induced. We parameterise
the coupling constant for hht¯t as ghhtt = chhttmt/(2v2). The four point interactions such as
hhV V and hht¯t play important roles in our analysis.

In the MCHMs, the couplings between the Higgs boson and the weak gauge bosons

deviate from the SM predictions as ghV V = gSM

hV V √1 − ξ, which leads to κV = √1 − ξ, no

matter how the SM fermions are embedded into SO(5) representations. It is the universal
prediction of the MCHMs. Here the compositeness parameter ξ is deﬁned as ξ ≡ v2/f 2

4

where v(≃ 246 GeV) is the VEV of the electroweak symmetry breaking. The coupling
constants of the contact interaction hhV V are also determined universal in the MCHMs as
chhV V = 1 − 2ξ. The universal reduction of chhV V is a notable feature of the MCHMs. In
the Higgs sector with multi-doublet structure such as that in the minimal SUSY SM, the

coupling constants chhV V are given by the gauge coupling constants as the same as those in

the SM.

On the other hand, Yukawa coupling constants with the matter fermions as well as the

self-coupling of the Higgs boson are determined by the matter sector of the MCHMs. As

described above, the matter fermions of the SM are embedded into a representation of SO(5).

We can individually embed qL = (uL, dL), uR, dR, ℓL = (νL, eL) and eR. Depending on the

choices for charge assignment for fermions, a variety of the models can be constructed. The

patterns of scale factors in various MCHMs are listed in Refs. [8, 9].

In order to demonstrate how to distinguish the MCHMs, we pick up three typical models,

MCHM4, MCHM5 and MCHM14, in which all the matter fermions are embedded into the

four-, ﬁve-, and fourteen-dimensional representations of SO(5), respectively. The relevant

matter part of the eﬀective Lagrangian in each model is given by

Lagrangian, the Higgs potential and the Yukawa couplings of the fermions can be computed

in each model.

In Table I, we summarise a set of scale factors in the three models up to the linear

term of ξ. Since the compositeness parameter ξ should be much smaller than unity by

the experimental constraints as we discuss later, the higher order terms are negligible. In

MCHM14, some scale factors depend not only on ξ but also on M t

In the limit of
2 → 0, the deviation pattern of the scale factors becomes the same as that in MCHM5.

In the following analysis, we set M t

1 = 0 for MCHM14 for simplicity.

The deviations in the Higgs boson couplings from the SM predictions aﬀect the Higgs

boson decay branching ratios. In Fig. 1, we show ratios of decay branching ratios of the Higgs

boson in MCHM5 and MCHM14 to the SM prediction in each decay mode. In the ﬁgure,
BR(h → XX) is the decay branching ratio of h → XX mode (XX = ZZ, W W, γγ, ¯ττ and
¯bb) and BRSM(h → XX) is its SM prediction. In Table II, the decay branching ratios in
the SM and in the MCHMs with typical value of ξ are shown. In MCHM4, all the decay
f = 1− ξ. The decay branching ratios are then
the same as those in the SM. In numerical evaluation, we take into account the NLO QCD

corrections[17] and the NLO electroweak corrections[18] to the branching ratios.

III. PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE MCHMS AT COLLIDER EXPERIMENTS

A. Current constraint on the compositeness parameter from the LHC Run-I data

It is known that the value of the compositeness parameter ξ is constrained as ξ < 0.25 from

the electroweak precision data[5, 12]. We here consider the constraint from the LHC Run-I

data, which gives a signiﬁcant impact. In order to take into account the constraint from the

data without extra assumption, we compare the model prediction with the measurement by

strained, because the scale factor κt decreases rapidly when ξ becomes large. In the three

MCHMs, the values of the signal strength µXX

F

are smaller than unity, while the measured

values tend to be larger. In particular, the central value of µZZ

F has slightly strong tension to

the MCHMs prediction, so that this mode gives the strongest constraint on the composite-

ness parameter ξ, in spite of the relatively large experimental uncertainty. In the following

discussion, we consider the parameter region of ξ < 0.25 for MCHM4 and MCHM5 and

ξ < 0.1 for MCHM14.

At the LHC Run-II, expected accuracy of each signal strength is more improved to be
within 10 % for main channels such as h → γγ, ZZ, W W, τ τ, bb[22], so that the value of ξ
becomes more signiﬁcantly constrained.

B. Double Higgs boson production at LHC

Measuring the double Higgs boson production process provides an insight on the self

coupling of the Higgs boson[23]. At the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) experiment, the

cross section of the double Higgs boson production is expected to be measured with 54%

uncertainty in the SM case[24].

In new physics models, the double Higgs boson produc-

tion process at LHC is also important to explore the deviation pattern in the Higgs boson

couplings. Diﬀerently from the single Higgs boson production or the Higgs boson decay,

contact interactions such as chhV V and chhtt play important roles. The double Higgs boson

production at LHC is analysed in the context of the MCHMs in the literature[10]. We here

show our numerical results not only on the production cross section of the double Higgs
boson production process, pp → hhX, but also on the signal strength for each decay mode
of hh in MCHM4, MCHM5 and MCHM14.

existence of the dimension ﬁve interaction hht¯t, there is a new diagram shown in Fig. 5-(d).

Therefore, the cross section of this process depends on the parameters κt, κhhh, and chhtt.
This process is measured by using the decay process of hh → ¯bbγγ, which is expected to be
the cleanest mode in the double Higgs boson production[23].
In Fig. 6, the production cross section of pp → ggX → hhX at the LHC with √s =

14 TeV and the ratio of the cross section to the SM prediction are shown as a function of

the compositeness parameter ξ in the three diﬀerent MCHMs. We also show the signal cross
section σ(pp → ggX → hhX → ¯bbγγX) and the signal strength of this process µ in each
model. Current upper limit is listed in Table IV, depending on models. We consider the

parameter region of ξ < 0.25 in MCHM4 and MCHM5, and ξ < 0.1 in MCHM14.

In MCHM4, the cross section can be 10 % smaller than the SM prediction for ξ ≃ 0.25.
In MCHM5, an enhancement is found to be 15 % at ξ ≃ 0.25. In MCHM14, the contribution
in Fig. 5-(d) enhances the production cross section in the large ξ region, because the size
of the scale factor chhtt = − 23
2 ξ is signiﬁcantly large. However, in MCHM14 the value of
ξ is strongly constrained as ξ < 0.1, and no signiﬁcant enhancement is obtained in the
allowed region of ξ. The signal cross section in the ¯bbγγ mode can be enhanced more than
65 % in MCHM5 for ξ ≃ 0.25. Even in MCHM14, the signal cross section can be enhanced
as large as 70 % in the allowed region (ξ < 0.1) due to the signiﬁcant enhancement in
BR(h → γγ). Although we do not study background by ourselves, which is beyond the
scope of our analysis, such a large deviation from the SM prediction may be detected at the
HL-LHC where the SM prediction of the cross section of pp → hhX → γγ¯bbX is expected
to be tested with the 67% uncertainty[24].

The Higgs boson coupling with weak gauge bosons such as κV and chhV V can be explored

by the double Higgs boson production via W -fusion. Relevant diagrams for W -fusion at the

among the diagrams in Fig. 7 leads to As = 0 so that the amplitude is at most constant

in the high energy limit. On the other hand, in the MCHMs, the unitarity cancellation

does not occur.

In such a case, perturbative unitarity is expected to be restored at a

higher scale M, where a new heavy resonance with the mass of M may contribute to the
W +W − → hh scattering[25]. For example, perturbative unitarity is violated at a scale of
2 TeV for ξ = 0.25 and at a scale of 3 TeV for ξ = 0.1 2. As discussed in Ref. [10, 25],
due to this unitarity non-cancellation at the scale √ˆs < M, the scattering cross section
of W +W − → hh in the MCHMs are enhanced as compared to the SM prediction, even
if the relevant coupling constants are all suppressed by the scale factors. Because of this
enhancement, the production cross section of pp → W +W −X → hhX is enhanced.

In Fig. 8, we show the production cross section of pp → W +W −X → hhX in MCHM4,
MCHM5 and MCHM14, and the ratio of them to the SM prediction. Hereafter, we utilise

2 At LHC, it is rare for the centre of mass energy of two initial W bosons to be higher than 2 TeV, due to
the PDF suppression. Therefore it is not easy to detect the violation of the perturbative unitarity directly
even in the case of ξ = 0.25.

of the cross section of the double Higgs boson production process. In the evaluation of the

cross section, we use the k-factor as k = 1.0[28]. Since the relevant scale factors κV , chhV V ,

and κhhh in MCHM14 are equal to those in MCHM5 as shown in Table I, the production

cross section is equal to each other in these two models. By taking into account the decay

modes of the Higgs boson, number of the signal event is diﬀerent in MCHM5 and MCHM14.

The production cross section of pp → W +W −X → hhX is as small as a few fb so that
it is hopeless to detect the process by using the clean decay mode of hh → ¯bbγγ, because
BR(h → γγ) is small. This process is detected in the decay modes of hh → ¯bb¯bb and
hh → ¯bbW +W −, due to rather large branching ratios of BR(h → ¯bb) and BR(h → W +W −).
In Fig. 9, the signal cross sections σ(pp → W +W −X → hhX → ¯bb¯bbX) and σ(pp →
W +W −X → hhX → ¯bbW +W −X) and their signal strength are shown. Though the signal
cross sections in both modes are of order of 0.1 fb, they are larger than the SM predictions.
For example, in MCHM14, the signal cross section for ξ ≃ 0.1 is almost twice as large as
the SM prediction. Such a large enhancement might be measured at the HL-LHC.

C. Double Higgs boson production at an electron-positron collider

The scale factor κV is very precisely measured at future electron-positron linear colliders.

For example, the value of κV is determined with accuracy of 1.0 % by measuring the single
Higgs boson production via e+e− → Zh and e+e− → h¯νν at the ILC(500) scenario[14]. In
the framework of the MCHMs, it means that the value of the compositeness parameter ξ is

measured at certain precision. Not only the gauge coupling of the Higgs boson but also the

17

decay branching ratios of the Higgs boson is precisely measured. For example, the signal
strength of the e+e− → h¯νν → ¯bb¯νν is expected to be measured at 0.7 % with the collision
energy √s = 500 GeV and the integrated luminosity of 500 fb−1[14].

The double Higgs boson production is also important to explore the Higgs sector. This

process is sensitive to the triple Higgs boson coupling hhh and the contact interaction hhV V ,

which cannot be determined by the single Higgs boson production processes. The most

promising process for the double Higgs boson production at an electron-positron collider

with √s = 500 GeV is the Z strahlung process as e+e− → Z ∗ → hhZ[16, 29]. At the ILC,
two hopeful decay modes hh → ¯bb¯bb and hh → ¯bbW +W − are used to detect the double Higgs
boson production process. We here discuss the production cross section. The production
cross section e+e− → hhZ is measured with accuracy of 42.7 % (23.7 %) at the ILC with
√s = 500 GeV and the integrated luminosity of 500 fb−1(1600 fb−1)[14].

In Fig. 10, the cross section of e+e− → Zhh and its ratio to the SM prediction is shown
in MCHM4, MCHM5 and MCHM14 as a function of √s. The production cross section in
MCHM14 is same as that in MCHM5. In the MCHMs the relevant coupling constants to
the decay process of Z ∗ → hhZ are all suppressed by the scale factors κV , chhV V and κhhh
so that the production cross section of e+e− → Z ∗ → hhZ is suppressed, compared to the
SM prediction in the all range of √s. The suppression factor is smaller than 0.5 for ξ & 0.2.

The double Higgs boson production process with a missing momentum as e+e− → hh¯νν
becomes more important for higher √s[16, 30].
It is expected that the production cross
section is measured with the accuracy of 26.3 %(16.7 %) at the ILC with √s = 1 TeV and the
integrated luminosity of 1 ab−1 (2.5 ab−1)[14]. This process mainly consists of two diﬀerent
subprocesses; i.e., Z-strahlung with Z → ¯νν and W -fusion as e+e− → W +W −¯νν → hh¯νν.
The latter provides complementary information to the process of e+e− → hhZ. In Fig. 11,
we show the production cross section of the process e+e− → hh¯νν in MCHM4, MCHM5
and MCHM14 for ﬁxed values of the compositeness parameter ξ = 0.1 and 0.2 as a function
of √s. As shown in these ﬁgures, the cross section of e+e− → hh¯νν is dominated by
Z-strahlung for √s . 600 GeV and by W -fusion for √s & 600 GeV.

In Fig. 12, ratios of the production cross section of e+e− → hh¯νν to the SM prediction
are shown as a function of √s. As explained before, the Z-strahlung process is always
suppressed by the scale factors in the MCHMs, on the other hand the W -fusion process is

enhanced in the high energy region because of unitarity non-cancellation. The cross section

of e+e− → hh¯νν is then suppressed as compared to the SM prediction for √s ≪ 600 GeV and
it is enhanced for √s ≫ 600 GeV. Thanks to the expected accuracy of measurements[14, 15],
such a speciﬁc behaviour might be observed by the √s scan at the ILC and the CLIC unless
the compositeness parameter ξ is too small.

The √s dependence of the double Higgs boson production cross section in the MCHMs
is diﬀerent from that in other new physics models. In Ref. [16], the production cross section
of e+e− → hh¯νν and e+e− → hhZ are discussed in the new physics models such that the
triple Higgs boson couplings can signiﬁcantly deviate from the SM prediction. For example,

in Fig. 13, which is taken from Ref. [16], the production cross sections in the two Higgs

doublet model 3 are shown.

In the two Higgs doublet model, due to large enhancement

of the triple Higgs boson coupling by loop contributions of the extra Higgs bosons, the

3 Here we focus on a scenario with the large non-decoupling loop eﬀect[31], in which the triple Higgs boson
coupling is signiﬁcantly enhanced. Such a scenario can play an important role in a successful electroweak
baryogenesis scenario[32].

double Higgs boson production cross section via the Z-strahlung process can be enhanced,

while the double Higgs boson production via W -fusion can be suppressed. In the MCHMs,

on the other hand, not only the triple Higgs boson coupling but also the gauge couplings

are deviated from those in the SM. All the relevant scale factors κhhh, κV and chhV V are

suppressed, and the unitarity cancellation is incomplete. Therefore the Z-strahlung process

is suppressed, and the W -fusion process is enhanced. This behaviour in the MCHMs is

qualitatively diﬀerent from that in the two Higgs doublet model so that these two models

can be distinguished from each other.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have investigated collider phenomenology of the MCHMs. In general, coupling con-

stants of the Higgs boson in the MCHMs can deviate from the SM predictions. The deviation

pattern depends on the compositeness parameter as well as the detail of the matter sector.

We have comprehensively studied how the model can be tested via measuring single

and double production processes of the Higgs boson at LHC and future electron-positron

colliders. We have shown the model dependent constraint on the compositeness parameter

ξ from the LHC Run-I data. Taking into account the constraint, we have estimated the

cross section of double Higgs boson production at LHC and electron-positron colliders, and

discussed the possibility to distinguish the matter sector among the MCHMs. We have
also shown that the √s dependence of the double Higgs boson production cross section at
electron-positron colliders diﬀers from the prediction in other new physics models.

In summary, at the HL-LHC, a large enhancement of the signal cross section of the

double Higgs boson production might be measured in some of the MCHMs. At the ILC

and the CLIC, we can expect that the MCHMs are tested with higher precision unless the

compositeness parameter ξ is too small. Furthermore, the measurement of the double Higgs
boson production process at various √s values would be helpful to discriminate MCHMs
from other new physics scenarios.

and the masses of extra Higgs bosons are taken to be degenerate as mΦ ≡ mH = mA = mH ±.
These ﬁgures are taken from Ref. [16].
