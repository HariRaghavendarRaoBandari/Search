We present a new state-of-the-art theoretical approach to model correlated magnetic transition
metal systems, by merging a form of self-consistent GW (QSGW ) and dynamical mean ﬁeld theory
(DMFT). Recent high resolution ARPES and Haas-van Alphen data of two typical transition metal
systems (Fe and Ni) are used as benchmark of the methodology. (i) Properties of Fe are very well
described by QSGW alone, owing to its nonlocal character. Agreement with experimental data
is excellent provided that ﬁnal-state scattering is taken into account. (ii) Due to the presence of
strong local spin ﬂuctuations, QSGW alone is not able to provide a consistent description of the Ni
ARPES data. To include spin ﬂuctuations we develop a novel form of QSGW +DMFT where DMFT
modiﬁes the self-energy in the spin channel only. We also present a heuristic method to include spin
ﬂuctuations in QSGW by introducing an auxiliary eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld. Remarkable agreement
is obtained with experiments by using our new methodology.

High-resolution spectroscopy is limited in transition
metals, in part because it is diﬃcult to make suﬃciently
high quality samples. Fe is one element of which high
quality ﬁlms (with low dislocation densities) have been
grown, and high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) performed [1]. Measurements
were carried out at reasonably high energy (139 eV)
where the penetration is deep enough that results are
not aﬀected by the surface, ﬁnal states are free-electron
like, and unwanted curvature of the electron’s path on
exiting the sample is smaller and better controlled. This
experiment provides a good reference to test the validity
of diﬀerent approximations of the electronic structure.

There are also not many calculations of spectral func-
tions in these materials. Fe has been studied in the local-
density approximation (LDA) [2] and with corrections
through Dynamical-Mean Field Theory (DMFT) [3].
It is not surprising that the LDA does not track the
ARPES experiment well [4], but it has been found that
LDA+DMFT also fails to properly account for ARPES
data [3]. The GW approximation [5] is widely applied
to many kinds of insulators, but how well it describes 3d
transition metals is much less established.

Through quasiparticle self-consistency (QSGW ) one
determines the noninteracting Green’s function G0 which
is minimally distant from the true Green’s function G
[6, 7]. Within QSGW many kinds of materials proper-
ties are in excellent agreement with experiment. These
include quasiparticle band structures, Dresselhaus coeﬃ-
cients [8], electric ﬁeld gradients [9], transmission proba-
bility [10], spin waves [11], and the dielectric response of
many materials.

Another key property of QSGW is that, at self-
consistency, the poles of G0(k, ω) coincide with the peaks
in G(k, ω). This means that there is no many-body
“mass renormalization” of the noninteracting Hamilto-
nian, which allows for a direct association of QSGW
energy bands E(k) with peaks in the spectral function
A(k, ω). Thus, QSGW provides an optimum framework
to test the range of validity, and the limitations to the
GW approximation.

In this work, we compare QSGW results [12] to var-
ious experimental data in elemental 3d materials in the
Fermi liquid (FL) regime, with a heavy focus on Fe be-
cause of the high quality of ARPES [1] and de Haas-van
Alphen (dHvA) [13, 14] data available. We will show
that the QSGW and ARPES spectral function agree to
within experimental resolution, with the proviso that the
ﬁnal state scattering is properly accounted in interpret-
ing the experimental data. By contrast, discrepancies
appear in Ni – a classical itinerant ferromagnet. This
can be attributed to the lack of spin ﬂuctuations in GW
diagrams. To account for them in an ab initio manner
we rely on a novel QSGW +DMFT implementation and
we compare the results with a model correction.

Fe in the Fermi liquid regime

Fig. 1 compares the calculated QSGW band structure
of Fe to peaks in ARPES spectra of Ref. [1], along with
some inverse photoemission data [15]. While agreement
appears to be very good, there are some discrepancies,
particularly along the Γ-H line. This line is redrawn

between 0.1H and 0.3H. δ ¯ω=0.06 eV tallies closely with
the discrepancy between the Vm band and the measured
ARPES peak for 0.1H<k<0.3H. There is also a signiﬁ-
cant discrepancy in the IIM band near k=0.77×H. Where
it crosses EF , the QSGW bands deviate from the ARPES
peak by nearly 0.15 eV. But ARPES simulated by Eq. (1)
is much closer to experiment (Fig. 2(c)). This is under-
stood from Fig. 2(d), which plots the QSGW dispersion
along a line ∆k⊥ normal to the ﬁlm surface, passing
through [0,0,0.77H]. A measurement that includes con-
tributions from this line biases the ARPES peak in the
direction of EF since Eqp is minimum at k⊥=0. Thus
we attribute most of the discrepancy in the Fermi sur-
face crossing (red star in 1(b)) to an artifact of ﬁnal-state
scattering.

In order to pin down the errors in QSGW more pre-
cisely , we turn to de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) measure-
ments. Extremal areas of the FS cross sections can be
extracted to high precision from frequencies observed in
dHvA and magnetoresistance experiments. Areas nor-

on a ﬁner scale in Fig. 2, to highlight the discrepancies.
As noted earlier, the QSGW band structure reﬂects the
peaks of A(k, ω) with no renormalizations from the ω- or
k- dependence of Σ.

In the FL regime, ARPES spectra I(k, ω) are gener-
ally thought to be a fairly direct measure of A(k, ω). But
the two are not identical even in the FL regime, indepen-
dently of the precision of the experimental setup. Assum-
ing a one-step model [16] for the photoemission process
(initial and ﬁnal state coupled through Fermi’s Golden
rule [16, 17]) I(k, ω) can be written as

(cid:90)

I(k, ω) ∝

dk⊥|Tf s|2|Mf i(k⊥)|2Af (k⊥)A(k, ω), (1)

where Af (k⊥) =

∆k⊥/2π

(∆k⊥/2)2 + (k⊥ − k0⊥)2

is the spectral function of the ﬁnal state, broadened
by scattering of the photoelectron as it approaches the
surface [18]. Tf s is the ﬁnal-state surface transmission
amplitude and Mf i the photoexcitation matrix element
(taken to be constant and k-independent [19]). Thus
the ﬁnal state is considered to be a damped Bloch wave,
taking the form of a Lorentzian distribution centred in
k0⊥ and broadened by ∆k⊥ [18], while the initial state
is an undamped Bloch function with an energy broaden-
ing ∆E, obtained through the QSGW spectral function.
This approximation is reasonable since in the FL regime
A(k, ω) is sharply peaked around the QP level. ∆k⊥
is directly related to the inverse of the electron mean
free path. For photon energy in the range 100-130 eV,
∆k⊥ ≈ 0.2 ˚A−1 [20, 21].

The ﬁnal-state scattering broadens I(ω); but it also
can shift the peak ¯ω in I(ω). The most signiﬁcant dis-
crepancy between ARPES and QSGW is found in the
Vm band, Fig. 2(a) between k=0 and 0.4×H. Fig. 2(b)
shows A(k, ω) calculated by QSGW, and the correspond-
ing I(k, ω) calculated from Eq. (1). Estimating the peak

mal to [110] and [111] are given in Table I, along with ar-
eas calculated by QSGW. Fig.1 shows the QSGW Fermi
surface, which closely resembles the one inferred by Lon-
zarich (version B) [22]. There is some diﬃculty (and am-
biguity) in resolving the small VIIIm pocket at N because
its tiny area is sensitive to computational details. Dis-
crepancies in the extremal areas are not very meaningful:
it is more sensible to determine the change ∆EF in Fermi
level needed to make the QSGW area agree with dHvA
measurements. This amounts to the average error in the
QSGW QP levels, assuming that the bands shift rigidly.

This assumption breaks down for the VI band because
of strong electron-phonon renormalization, discussed be-
low. Ref. 1 also extracts velocities ¯hvF at the Fermi
surface from the k-dependence of ARPES peaks near EF
(see Table in Fig.2). Agreement is generally very good,
except for a rather large discrepancy in the I band veloc-
ities. We analyse this discrepancy when discussing the
cyclotron mass. Some limited cyclotron data for eﬀec-
tive masses are also available [23]. These are expected
to be more reliable than ARPES data.
It is seen that
agreement is excellent (Table I, bottom panel) except for
the small VI pocket. We get a better comparison by ac-
counting for the electron-phonon coupling with a simple
model [24]. From the model, vF is renormalized by a fac-
tor 1+λ=1.6, which reasonably accounts for discrepancy
between the QSGW and the cyclotron mass in pocket
VI. The other pockets are much larger (Fig 1(b)), mak-
ing vF much larger on average, and the renormalization
smaller. The cyclotron data enables us to assess the sys-
tematic diﬀerence in the QSGW and ARPES vF for band
I (Table in Fig. 2). The three points in the table serve
as a reasonable estimate for the average velocity of the
entire pocket, which cyclotron data measures. The fact
that QSGW agrees well with cyclotron data strongly sug-
gests the QSGW predictions at the individual points are

more reliable than the ARPES data.

Ni: an archetypical itinerant magnet

Less detailed information is available for other elemen-
tal transition metals. We have extracted some experi-
mental bandwidths, and also the exchange splitting ∆Ex
in the magnetic elements. Fig. 3(a) shows that both seem
to be very well described by QSGW, except that ∆Ex
deviates strongly from experiment in Ni. QSGW signiﬁ-
cantly improves not only on the LSDA, but also on fully
self-consistent GW [25] because of loss of spectral weight
in fully self-consistent G that is avoided in QSGW [6].

Fig. 4 compares the QSGW band structure of Ni to
ARPES data [26]. Agreement is excellent in the mi-
nority channel, but ∆Ex is uniformly too large on the
symmetry lines shown. Also the band near −1 eV at L
(consisting of s character there) is traditionally assumed
to be a continuation of the d band denoted as white and
green diamonds; but the calculations show that at it is
a continuation of Ni s band. The corresponding LSDA
band (light dotted lines) crosses L at EF−0.44 eV; also
the d bands are much wider.

∆Ex is about twice too large in both QSGW and the
LSDA, and for that reason spin wave frequencies are also
too large [27]. Neither the LDA nor GW include spin
ﬂuctuations, which reduce the average moment and thus

∆Ex. Spin ﬂuctuations(cid:10)M 2(cid:11) are important generally in

itinerant magnets, and one important property they have
is to reduce the average magnetic moment (cid:104)M(cid:105) [28, 29].
Fig. 3(b) shows this trend quite clearly: systems such
as Fe, Co, and NiO are very well described by QSGW,
but M is always overestimated in itinerant magnets such
as FeAl, Ni3Al, and Fe based superconductors such as
BaFe2As2. Ni is also itinerant to some degree (unlike Fe,
its average moment probably disappears as T→Tc), and
its moment should be overestimated. This is found to be
the case for QSGW, as Fig. 3(b) shows.

Local spin ﬂuctuations are well captured by localised
non perturbative approaches, such as DMFT, and we can

respondingly the projection and embedding schemes im-
plemented in our QSGW suite follow the prescriptions
of reference [33] which are outlined in the supplemental
material [24].

We carry out a DMFT calculation on the Ni d orbitals
with the intent of extracting a static correction to the
QSGW calculation. The bath is computed with a spin-
averaged exchange correlation potential from QSGW Σ1
to which we add the static part of the spin-ﬂip correction
Σ2 obtained from a complete DMFT loop [24]. The two
potentials, Σ1 with no spin part, and Σ2 with no charge
part, do not overlap so that Σ2 may be added to Σ1
without double counting.

The results, shown in Fig. 4(c) and summarised in
the corresponding Table, report a quenching of both
∆Ex and M with respect to the QSGW calculation. A
similar trend was found in [3] (LDA+DMFT) and [31]
(G0W0+DMFT) in comparison with the LDA bench-
mark.
It is worth stressing that our results not only
agree very well with the experimental values, but they
are also almost indistinguishable from the semi-empirical
QSGW +Beﬀ ones (cf. Fig. 4(c)).

Conclusions

To summarize, we have performed detailed QSGW cal-
culations of the electronic band structure of several 3d
metallic compounds to assess the reliability of this the-
ory in the Fermi liquid regime.

Focusing our analysis mostly on Fe and Ni, for which
very high quality ARPES measurement (plus dHvA and
cyclotron data for Fe) are available, we conclude that
QSGW provides very accurate description of the band
structure around EF . We also made a brief survey of
other 3d magnetic transition metals, ﬁnding correspond-
ingly good agreement, except in the itinerant case of Ni
where spin ﬂuctuations become important.

– Fe: Through de Haas-van Alphen and cyclotron
measurements we established that QSGW QP levels at
EF have an error of ∼ 0.05 eV, and eﬀective masses are
well described. Comparable precision is found below EF
by comparing to ARPES data, provided ﬁnal state scat-
tering is taken into account. The QSGW d bandwidth
falls in close agreement with ARPES, and is approxi-
mately 0.75 times that of the LDA (Fig. 1).

If Σ is k-averaged to simulate a local self-energy, the
QSGW band structure changes signiﬁcantly and resem-
bles the LDA. Thus non-locality in the self-energy is im-
portant in transition metals, and its absence explains
why LDA+DMFT does not yield good agreement with
ARPES [3].

– Ni: QSGW d bandwidths, the t2g−eg splitting, the
s−d alignment, are all in excellent agreement with exper-
iment, while (cid:104)M(cid:105) and ∆Ex are too large. Fortuitous error

reasonably expect that the addition of spin-ﬂip diagrams
to QSGW via, e.g. DMFT, would be suﬃcient to incor-
porate these eﬀects. To verify this, we ﬁrst assume that
the predominant eﬀect of spin ﬂuctuations will result in
an additional contribution to the static QSGW poten-
tial. This will be the case if the quasiparticle picture is a
reasonable description of Ni, even if QSGW alone does
not contain enough physics to yield an optimum quasi-
particle approximation.

We ﬁrst model spin ﬂuctuations by carrying out the
QSGW self-consistent cycle in the presence of a mag-
netic ﬁeld Beﬀ , and tuning Beﬀ to reduce M . Our key
ﬁnding is that when Beﬀ is tuned to make M agree with
experiment, ∆Ex does also, reproducing ARPES spectra
to high precision in the FL regime. Both the QSGW
and LSDA overestimate M for itinerant systems, but
the latter also underestimates it in local-moment systems
(Fig. 3(b)). In the LSDA treatment of Ni, these eﬀects
cancel and render the moment fortuitously good. When
spin ﬂuctuations are folded in through Beﬀ , the LSDA
moment becomes too small.

For an adequate ab initio foundation we note that
QSGW does an excellent job at handling the impor-
tant diagrams (especially screening) in a parameter-free
way, apart from the spin-ﬂip contributions. On the other
hand these latter are largely local, and they are well
taken into account with DMFT. A G0W0+DMFT study
of ferromagnetic Ni can be found in [31, 32]. Here we
adopt a novel implementation of QSGW +DMFT. The
DMFT part relies on the Continuous Time Quantum
Monte Carlo solver implemented by K. Haule [33]; cor-

cancellation partly conceals failings of the LSDA, which
yield good (cid:104)M(cid:105) but overestimates ∆Ex.

To account for spin ﬂuctuations, we established that
the addition of a constant to QSGW calculations Beﬀ
eliminates discrepancies in both (cid:104)M(cid:105) and ∆Ex. To ac-
count for spin ﬂuctuations in an ab initio framework,
we constructed a novel QSGW +DMFT implementation
with the self-energy in the charge channel carried by GW
and the spin channel by DMFT, thus avoiding ambigui-
ties in double-counting. The magnetic moment and band
structure from a quasiparticlized Hamiltonian was essen-
tially identical in the the two cases showing that (at least
for Ni) spin ﬂuctuations are very well approximated by a
static, constant ﬁeld. Beside the fundamental relevance
of this result, this conclusion is of particular interest
also for technical reasons, especially when calculations
on large magnetic systems are concerned.

many-body “mass renormalization” of the noninteract-
ing hamiltonian. In other words, the attribution of mass
renormalization to correlation eﬀects, a concept widely
used in the literature [4], is ill-deﬁned: it depends on an
arbitrary reference, e.g. the LDA. The absence of mass
renormalization is a very useful property: we can directly
associate QSGW energy bands E(k) with peaks in the
spectral function A(k, ω).

Electron-phonon renormalization of eﬀective masses

In the region VI of the Fermi surface, the agreement
between the computed m∗ /m and the experiment is not
as good as for the other regions (see Table I in main
text). To improve the agreement, we accounted for the
electron-phonon renormalization in a simple way.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL

According to a Thomas-Fermi model of screening [34],
the elecron-phonon interaction renormalizes vF by a fac-
tor 1+λ. Band VI is roughly spherical, enabling us to

Computational details

Quasiparticle self-consistency is a construction that de-
termines the noninteracting Green’s function G0 that is
minimally distant from the true Green’s function G. A
measure of distance, or metric is necessary; a good choice
[6] results in an eﬀective static potential:

¯Σxc =

ij

(cid:111)(cid:104)ψj|. (2)

Re[Σ(εi)] + Re[Σ(εj)]ij

Σij(ω) is the self-energy in the basis of single-particle
eigenstates |ψi(cid:105), which becomes iG0W in the GW ap-
proximation. Starting from a trial G0, e.g.
the LDA,
¯Σxc is determined through GW, which determines a new
G0. The cycle is repeated until self-consistency.
Recently Ismail-Beigi showed that Eq. 2 also minimizes
the gradient of the Klein functional, |δF|2, where F is
evaluated in the subspace of all possible static ¯Σxc [7].

Another key property of Eq. 2 is that, at self-
consistency, the poles of G0(k, ω) coincide with the peaks
in G(k, ω) . Therefore the band structure generated
by V xc coincides with the peaks of the specral function
A(k, ω). This is signiﬁcant, because it means there is no

QS GW

For the high resolution needed here, computational

conditions had to be carefully controlled.
In both QSGW calculations of Fe and Ni, a k mesh
of 12×12×12 divisions was found to be suﬃcient for
calculating Σ. The one-body part was evaluated on a
24×24×24 mesh.

Fe 3p and 4d states were included through local or-
bitals: omitting these and treating 3p as core levels [6]
can shift QP levels by as much as 0.1 eV in the FL regime.
Other parameters [6], such as broadening the pole in G
in constructing Σ=iGW , the basis of eigenfunction prod-
ucts, and the energy cutoﬀ for the oﬀ-diagonal parts of
Σ, were also carefully monitored. When set to tight tol-
erances QP levels near EF were stable to a resolution
of 0.05 eV. QP levels are calculated including spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), though it is omitted in the calculation
of Σ. The eﬀect of SOC on Σ was found to make small
changes to ¯Σxc.

Similar parameters were used in the QSGW calcula-

tion for Ni.

QS GW+DMFT

Concerning the QSGW +DMFT calculation on Ni, we
projected the lattice problem on the Ni d orbitals follow-
ing the prescription of Haule [35]. We compute higher
level diagrams locally using the hybridization expansion
version of the numerically exact continuous time QMC
method [33, 36].

In order to single out the correlated subspace, a pro-
cedure of projection/embedding which was originally in-
troduced in [35] in the LAPW basis of the Wien2k pack-
age, is developed in the Full-Potential Linear Muﬃn-Tin
Orbitals (FP-LMTO) basis [37]. This projector maps
the full space Green’s function Gijk (with band and k-
point label {ijk}) to the local Green’s function Gloc
LL(cid:48) de-
ﬁned only on the correlated subspace. The compact in-
dex L := {τ, R, σ, (cid:96), m}, collects information on the atom
type τ , site R, spin coordinate σ, and angular momen-
tum components (cid:96) and m. The projection operation can
be cast in the following form:

where the coeﬃcients AL
ik account for localization inside
the sphere, while Φu
R(cid:96) gives an estimate of correlations
relative to the speciﬁc orbital component (cid:96). More specif-
ically AL
ik are linear combinations of spherical harmonics
Y(cid:96)m and the QSGW quasiparticle eigenfunctions in the
FP-LMTO basis. The terms Φu
R(cid:96) are radial integral of
the kind (cid:104)ϕu
R(cid:96) indicates
the possibility of selecting the radial solution ϕR(cid:96) of the
Schr¨odinger equation inside the MTO, its energy deriva-
tive ˙ϕR(cid:96), and its local orbitals contributions ϕz
R(cid:96) [6]. By
means of these deﬁnitions we ensure that the localized or-
bitals are centred on the correlated atom corresponding
to the muﬃn-tin site R.

The local Green’s function is deﬁned on a grid of Mat-
subara frequencies iωn = iπ(2n+1)/β and it is employed
to calculate the hybridization function of the system,
which feeds the CTQMC impurity solver. The result
of the impurity solver is the local impurity self-energy
Σloc
LL(cid:48)(iω) also deﬁned on the Matsubara axis. In order to
update the full Green’s function Gijk with this local self-
energy, so to iterate the DMFT loop to self-consistency,
an embedding procedure is needed. Because of the spe-
ciﬁc properties of the transformation U , the embedding
procedure Σloc
jk can be op-
erated by means of the same matrices, even though this
is not a general requirement of the theory [35].

This is done for the spin-up and spin-down channels sep-
arately. We ﬁnally retained only the spin-ﬂip compo-
nent Σ2 = ¯Σloc − ( ¯Σloc↑ + ¯Σloc↓ )/2 and we added it to
the charge component Σ1 = ( ¯Σxc↑ + ¯Σxc↓ )/2 computed at
QSGW level, as explained in the main text. This proce-
dure allowed us to prevent counting twice the magnetic
contributions to the self-energy.

The projectors used for the Ni 3d are constructed from
5 bands below EF and 3 bands above EF , which cor-
respond to a window of ∼±10 eV. By choosing a wide
energy window, U becomes nearly static [38]. The corre-
sponding on-site Coulomb parameters were chosen to be
U =10 eV and J=0.7 eV, close to the values calculated
by constrained RPA [38]. The Matsubara frequency grid
is deﬁned over 2000 points with an inverse temperature
β = 50 eV−1.

The charge double-counting contribution has been in-

cluded by means of the standard formula

Edc = U (n − 1/2) − J(n/2 − 1/2)

where n is the nominal occupancy of the 3d shell.
In-
stead, the magnetic double-counting has been avoided
by computing the charge contribution to the self-energy
in only within QSGW and extracting the spin contribu-
tion from the DMFT calculation, as better explained in
the main text.

Nine iterations of the DMFT loop (each composed by
projection + CTQMC + embedding) have been necessary
to converge the static limit of the impurity self-energy.
At each iteration, around 1010 random moves have been
done to solve the impurity problem.

[32] The main accomplishment of work [31] was actually to
reproduce at the GW+DMFT level the satellite struc-
ture at ∼-6 eV, already captured by Lichtenstein and co-
workers [3] in a previous LDA+DMFT calculation. The
investigation of this spectral feature is currently under
study with our implementation.
