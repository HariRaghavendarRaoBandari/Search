Extending small arcs to large arcs

Simeon Ball

Abstract

An arc is a set of vectors of the k-dimensional vector space over the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements
q, in which every subset of size k is a basis of the space, i.e. every k-subset is a set of linearly
F
independent vectors. Given an arc G in a space of odd characteristic, we prove that there is an
upper bound on the largest arc containing G. The bound is not an explicit bound but is obtained
by computing properties of a matrix constructed from G. In some cases we can also determine
the largest arc containing G, or at least determine the hyperplanes which contain exactly k − 2
vectors of the large arc. The theorems contained in this article may provide new tools in the
computational classiﬁcation and construction of large arcs. The article also simpliﬁes some of
the proofs of the results found in [1], [2, Chapter 7], [3] and [5] and uniﬁes the approach taken
in those articles with that in [4] and [13].

Introduction

Let Vk(Fq) denote the k-dimensional vector space over Fq, the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements.
An arc of Vk(Fq) is a set S of vectors of Vk(Fq) in which every subset of size k is a basis
of Vk(Fq). Most authors deﬁne an arc, equivalently, as a set of points in the corresponding
projective space. However, for the techniques that we wish to develop here it is more convenient
to use the vector space. The set of columns of a generator matrix of a k-dimensional linear
maximum distance separable (MDS) code over Fq is an arc of Vk(Fq) and vice-versa, so arcs
and linear MDS codes are equivalent objects. As in coding theory, we deﬁne the weight of a
vector to be the number of non-zero coordinates that it has.

We will assume throughout that k > 3.
Let det(v1, . . . , vk) denote the determinant of the matrix whose i-th row is vi, a vector of

Vk(Fq). If C = {p1, . . . , pk−1} is an ordered set of k − 1 vectors then we write

det(u, C) = det(u, p1, . . . , pk−1),

where we evaluate the determinant with respect to a ﬁxed canonical basis.

Given an arc G of Vk(Fq) and a non-negative integer n 6 |G| − k, we order the elements of
G arbitrarily and construct a matrix Mn, in the following way. For each subset E of G of size
|G| − n and subset A of E of size k − 2, we get a column of the matrix Mn, whose rows are
indexed by subsets C of G of size k − 1, where a (C, (A, E)) entry is

Yu∈G\E

det(u, C),

if and only if A ⊂ C, and zero otherwise.
We shall prove the following theorem.

Theorem 1.1.

If there is a vector of weight one in the column space of Mn then G cannot

be extended to an arc of size q + 2k + n − 1 − |G|.

If q is odd then Theorem 1.1 always provides at least some upper bound on the size of an arc
S containing G. To see this, consider M|G|−k and the columns for a ﬁxed subset E of G of size
k. Restricting to rows which are not the all-zero row vector, one obtains a copy of an inclusion
matrix whose rows are indexed by the (k − 1)-subsets of E and whose columns are indexed by
(k − 2)-subsets of E. Since E is ﬁxed, the non-zero entries in any row are the same. Therefore,
to calculate the rank we can divide out by this non-zero element and assume that each entry
of the matrix is either 0 or 1. It’s straightforward to verify that this matrix has rank k if q is
odd (see [8] or [15] for a general formula for p-ranks of inclusion matrices) and hence full row
rank, which implies there is a vector of weight one in the column space of M|G|−k.

A weaker version of Theorem 1.1 appears in [5], where the condition on Mn is that it should
have full row rank. There are many examples where Mn does not have full row rank but where
it does have a vector of weight one in its column space. For example, the arc of size 7

G = {[τ 0, 0, 0], [0, τ 0, 0], [0, 0, τ 0], [τ 0, τ 5, τ 0], [τ 0, τ 8, τ 9], [τ 0, τ, τ 5], [τ 0, τ 3, τ ]},

where τ is a primitive element of F11. The matrix M2 does not have full row rank (it has rank
20, whereas full row-rank would be 21), but it does have a vector of weight one in its column
space. Therefore, Theorem 1.1 implies that it cannot be extended to an arc of size 11. It can
be extended to an arc of size 10.

We say that (G, n) has Property W if for each subset A of G of size k − 2, there exist
subsets C, C1, . . . , C|G|−n−k+1 of G of size k − 1 containing A, such that the column space of
Mn contains a vector (of weight two) with non-zero coordinates at only C and Ci for each
i = 1, . . . , |G| − n − k + 1.

We deﬁne a co-secant to an arc S of Vk(Fq) to be a hyperplane containing precisely k − 2
vectors of S. An arc is complete if it is not contained in a larger arc, and an arc is uniquely
completable if there is only one complete arc containing it.

We shall also prove the following theorem.

Theorem 1.2.

If (G, n) has Property W and G can be extended to an arc S of size
q + 2k + n − 1 − |G| then the co-secants to S containing only points of G are determined by
G.

Theorem 1.2 has the following corollary.

Corollary 1.3.

If Mn has rank one less than full row rank and G can be extended to
an arc S of size q + 2k + n − 1 − |G| then the co-secants to S containing only points of G are
determined by G.

Proof.

If G can be extended to an arc S of size q + 2k + n − 1 − |G| then by Theorem 1.1
there are no vectors of weight one in the column space of Mn. Since the rank of Mn is one less
than full row rank, using column operations one can transform the matrix Mn, into a matrix
that has the identity matrix (of size one less than the number of rows) in the top left hand
corner. By taking one of these columns, or a linear combination of two of them, we have that
every vector of weight two is in the column space of Mn, so Property W holds.

There is an inclusion-reversing duality between the r-dimensional subspaces of Vk(Fq) and
the (k − r)-dimensional subspaces. Under this duality the set of co-secants to an arc S of

size q + k − 1 − t is a set of (cid:0) |S|

k−2(cid:1)t vectors. In [13] and [4] respectively, Segre (the case k is

three) and Blokhuis, Bruen and Thas prove that this set of vectors is contained in an algebraic
hypersurface φS of degree t if q is even and of degree 2t if q is odd. Moreover, φS can be
constructed from a sub-arc G of S of size k + t − 1 if q is even and k + 2t − 1 if q is odd, if one
knows all the co-secants to S containing only points of G, see Section 5. Therefore, Theorem 1.2
can be strengthened to the following theorem.

Theorem 1.4.

If (G, n) has Property W and G can be extended to an arc S of size
q + 2k + n − 1 − |G| then φS is determined by G, provided that 2n > |G| − k − 1 in the case
that q is odd.

Theorem 1.4 has the following corollary, the proof of which is identical to the proof of

Corollary 1.3.

Corollary 1.5.

If Mn has rank one less than full row rank and G can be extended to an
arc S of size q + 2k + n − 1 − |G| then φS is determined by G, provided that 2n > |G| − k − 1
in the case that q is odd.

We will prove in Section 5 that G never satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1, Theorem 1.2
and Theorem 1.4 when q is even, see Theorem 5.2, apart from in the trivial case that |G| = k + n
in which case the hypotheses of Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4 are satisﬁed. In [13] and [4]
respectively, Segre (the case k is three) and Blokhuis, Bruen and Thas prove that if q is odd
and G has size at least k − 1 + (2q/3) or if q is even and G has size at least k + (q/2) then G is
uniquely completable. Thus, Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4 are of interest only when q is odd
and G is smaller than k − 1 + (2q/3).

To illustrate the applicability of Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4 we ﬁrst consider some
examples. It is perhaps surprising that G can be relatively small and still have Property W .
Let

G = {[ǫ0, 0, 0], [0, ǫ0, 0], [0, 0, ǫ0], [ǫ0, ǫ2, ǫ3], [ǫ0, ǫ6, ǫ4], [ǫ0, ǫ9, ǫ9], [ǫ0, ǫ4, ǫ6], [ǫ0, ǫ11, ǫ5], [ǫ0, ǫ0, ǫ8]},

where ǫ is a primitive element of F13. Then (G, 3) has Property W , so Theorem 1.2 implies
that if it can be extended to an arc S of V3(F13) of size 12 (and it can) then φS is determined
by G.
Let

G = {[ǫ0, 0, 0], [0, ǫ0, 0], [0, 0, ǫ0], [ǫ0, ǫ10, ǫ2], [ǫ0, ǫ2, ǫ11], [ǫ0, ǫ9, ǫ4]},

where ǫ is a primitive element of F13. Then (G, 2) has Property W , so Theorem 1.2 implies
that if it can be extended to an arc S of V3(F13) of size 14 (and it can) then φS is determined
by G. In this case φS also determines S. Note that by Segre’s theorem [12], we know that S
is a conic. The small arc G also completes to arcs of size 9, 10 and 12, so it is not uniquely
completable.

In [1], it is shown that if k 6 p, where p is the prime such that q is a power of p, then there
are no arcs of size q + 2. This follows from Theorem 1.1 by considering the p-rank formula for
inclusion matrices from [8] or [15]. If k 6 p then for any arc G of size 2k − 3 the matrix M0
has full row-rank and therefore a vector of weight one in its column space. In [3], it is shown
that if k 6 2p − 2, where q is a non-prime prime power, then there are no arcs of size q + 2.
Indeed it can be shown that, see [5], for an arc G of size 2k − 2 the matrix M1 has a vector

Page 4 of 14

SIMEON BALL

of weight one in its column space, so Theorem 1.1 implies that if k 6 2p − 2 then there are no
arcs of size q + 2. Computational evidence for small k and small p suggests that the following
is true.

Conjecture 1.

If k 6 p + n(p − 2) and G has size 2k − 3 + n then the matrix Mn has a

vector of weight one in its column space.

If Conjecture 1 is true then Theorem 1.1 would imply that there are no arcs of size q + 2
for k 6 (pq − 2q + 6p − 10)/(2p − 3). This would verify the MDS conjecture for these k. For
more on the MDS conjecture, see for example [1], [9], [11] or [14]. A version of Conjecture 1
in which Mn is conjectured to have full row-rank appears in [5]. Since there are examples of
arcs G of size 2k − 3 + n with k > p + n(p − 2) for which Mn does not have vectors of weight
one in its column space, this would appear to put a limit on these methods for verifying the
MDS conjecture in its entirety. To verify the MDS conjecture one must show that there are no
arcs of size q + 2 for 4 6 k 6 (q + 2)/2, so one would fall short.

Theorem 1.1, Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4 may be of some use in classifying or at least
constructing large arcs computationally. See [6], [7] and [10] for recent computational results
regarding arcs. To classify arcs of size q + k − r one would need to classify arcs of size k + r. If
one could classify arcs of size k + r then one could quickly check for each arc to see if M1 has
a vector of weight one in the column space, for each projectively distinct arc G. In the positive
case, this would then rule out the possibility that G can be extended to an arc of size q + k − r.
In the negative case, one can then extend the arc to an arc H of size k + r + 1 and check to see
if M2 (calculated using H) has a vector of weight one in the column space. In the positive case,
this would then rule out the possibility that H can be extended to a arc of size q + k − r. This
should dramatically reduce the set of possible sub-arcs of arcs of size q + k − r. Those small
arcs which cannot be ruled out as possibly extending to a large arc of course may well extend.
In this case Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4 come into play. If (G, 1) or (H, 2) etc., has property
W then Theorem 1.2 and possibly Theorem 1.4 applies. Knowing G and the co-secants to S
containing the points of G may well be enough to determine S and even if it doesn’t, it will
certainly drastically reduce the possible vectors which might extend G.

For example, consider the following arc of size 11 of V6(F81)

G = {[ρ0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, ρ0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, ρ0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, ρ0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, ρ0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ρ0], [ρ0, ρ0, ρ0, ρ0, ρ0, ρ0], [ρ0, ρ58, ρ41, ρ14, ρ54, ρ48],

[ρ0, ρ25, ρ55, ρ43, ρ74, ρ58], [ρ0, ρ, ρ66, ρ22, ρ42, ρ65], [ρ0, ρ76, ρ44, ρ21, ρ43, ρ5]},

where ρ is a primitive element of F81. The matrix M1 has rank 461 and full row rank would
be 462. It does not have a vector of weight one in its column space, so Theorem 1.1 does not
apply. However, Corollary 1.3 does apply. Suppose that G extends to an arc S of size 82. From
a vector which is a basis of the null space of the row space of M1 we can calculate fA (see
the next section) for every subset A of G of size 4. These polynomials of degree 4 must all be
fully reducible into linear factors. Moreover, for each linear form α, which is a factor of fA for
some A, the hyperplane ker α contains only the points A of S and no other points of S. This
severely restricts how one can extend G.

Even if the classiﬁcation of arcs of size k + r for a certain q is infeasible computationally, one
may be able to construct new examples of size q + k − r. By identifying the small arcs which
can appear as sub-arcs of an arc of size q + k − r one can apply Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4,
as explained in the previous paragraph.

If C = {p1, . . . , pk−1} is an ordered set of k − 1 vectors then we write

2. The functions fA

det(u, C) = det(u, p1, . . . , pk−1),

and if A = {p1, . . . , pk−2} is an ordered set of k − 2 vectors then we write

det(u, v, A) = det(u, v, p1, . . . , pk−2),

where we evaluate the determinant with respect to a ﬁxed canonical basis. This deﬁnes a
bilinear form on Vk(Fq) × Vk(Fq) by

dA(u, v) = det(u, v, A).

Let S be an arc of Vk(Fq). We order the elements of S arbitrarily and maintain this order
throughout, unless otherwise stated. Let A and B be subsets of the ordered set S. If we write
A, B in place of A ∪ B then this means order the elements of A ﬁrst and then order the elements
of B.

Let A be a subset of S of size k − 2.

Lemma 2.1. The bilinear form dA is alternating and in particular dA(u, v) = −dA(v, u).

Proof. By the deﬁnition of dA we have dA(u, u) = det(u, u, A) = 0 and

dA(u, v) = det(u, v, A) = − det(v, u, A) = −dA(v, u).

Let t = q + k − 1 − |S|.

Lemma 2.2. There are t hyperplanes which contain the vectors of A and no other vectors

of S.

Proof. There are q + 1 hyperplanes containing the subspace spanned by the k − 2 vectors
of A. Since S is an arc, a hyperplane can contain at most k − 1 vectors of S. Therefore, there
are |S| − |A| of them which contain one more vector of S and so q + 1 − |S| + k − 2 of them
which contain no more vectors of S.

Let α1, . . . , αt be pairwise linearly independent forms with the property that ker αi ∩ S = A.

Deﬁne

fA(x) =

t

αi(x),

a function from Vk(Fq) to Fq.

Lemma 2.3.

If E is a subset of S of size t + k − 1 containing A then

fA(x) = Xe∈E\A

fA(e) Yu∈E\(A∪{e})

dA(u, x)
dA(u, e)

.

Page 6 of 14

SIMEON BALL

Proof. With respect to a basis B whose last k − 2 elements are A, fA is a homogeneous

polynomial in two variables, and so is

Xe∈E\A

fA(e) Yu∈E\(A∪{e})

dA(u, x)
dA(u, e)

.

These two polynomials are equal when evaluated at an element of E \ A. Two homogeneous
polynomials of degree t in two variables which are equal at t + 1 linearly independent points
are the same, since their diﬀerence is a homogeneous polynomials in two variables of degree
at most t and can be zero at at most t linearly independent points. Note that it follows from
the arc property that any two points of E \ A are linearly independent, even after deleting the
k − 2 coordinates corresponding to the elements of A in the basis.

Lemma 2.4.

If E is a subset of S of size t + k containing A then

Xe∈E\A

fA(e) Yu∈E\(A∪{e})

dA(u, e)−1 = 0.

Proof. Suppose that v ∈ E \ A and apply Lemma 2.3 with E replaced by E \ {v},

fA(v) = Xe∈E\(A∪{v})

fA(e) Yu∈E\(A∪{v,e})

dA(u, v)
dA(u, e)

.

Dividing by

gives

Yu∈E\(A∪{v})

dA(u, v)

fA(v) Yu∈E\(A∪{v})

dA(u, v)−1 = Xe∈E\(A∪{v})

fA(e)

dA(v, e)

dA(e, v) Yu∈E\(A∪{e})

dA(u, e)−1,

and so the lemma follows from Lemma 2.1.

The aim of the following section is to show that we can multiply the equation in Lemma 2.4
by an element of Fq, dependent on A, so that the terms depend only on C = A ∪ {e} and not
on A. This implies that we will get an equation for each (k − 2)-subset of E whose “variables”
depend only on the (k − 1)-subsets of E.

3. A set of equations associated with an arc

The following lemma is called the co-ordinate free version of Segre’s lemma of tangents,
proved in [1] and also [2, Lemma 7.15]. In order that this article be self-contained we include
a proof.

Proof. Let B = {x, y, z} ∪ D. Since B is a subset of S of size k, it is a basis of Vk(Fq).
There are q + 1 hyperplanes containing hz, Di, since it is a (k − 2)-dimensional subspace of

Vk(Fq). We start oﬀ by identifying these q + 1 hyperplanes.

Suppose that u ∈ S \ B and that (u1, . . . , uk) are the coordinates of u with respect to the

basis B. The hyperplane hu, z, Di is

ker(u2X1 − u1X2),

since {z} ∪ D is the set of the last k − 2 vectors of the basis B. For each u ∈ S \ B, since S is
an arc, we have a distinct hyperplane hu, z, Di, and so |S \ B| = q − 1 − t of them in all.

Suppose that the function fD∪{z} is

fD∪{z}(u) =

t

Yi=1

αi(u),

where ker αi ∩ S = D ∪ {z} and α1, . . . , αt are pairwise linearly independent linear forms.

With respect to the basis B, the linear form αi(X) is

αi(X) = αi1X1 + αi2X2,

for some αi1, αi2 ∈ Fq. Since ker αi ⊃ D ∪ {z}, this gives us a further t hyperplanes containing
hz, Di.

The other two hyperplanes are ker X1 = hy, z, Di and ker X2 = hx, z, Di.
The q − 1 hyperplanes containing hz, Di, and not containing x or y, are

where a ∈ Fq \ {0}. Therefore,

since it is the product of all non-zero elements of Fq, which is −1.

With respect to the basis B, x has coordinates (1, 0, . . . , 0), and so

αi1.

Similarly

fD∪{z}(y) =

so the equation above implies

Repeating the above, switching y and z gives,

fD∪{y}(z) Yu∈S\B

u1 = (−1)t+1fD∪{y}(x) Yu∈S\B

u3.

And switching x and y gives,

fD∪{x}(z) Yu∈S\B

u2 = (−1)t+1fD∪{x}(y) Yu∈S\B

u3.

Combining these three equations gives,

fD∪{x}(y)fD∪{y}(z)fD∪{z}(x) = (−1)t+1fD∪{x}(z)fD∪{y}(x)fD∪{z}(y),

Let F be the subset of the ﬁrst k − 2 elements of S with respect to the ordering of S.

transpositions required to order (F ∩ C, F \ C) as F .

The following is from [2, Lemma 7.19]. Again, in order that this article be self-contained, we

include a proof.

Lemma 3.2. For a subset A of S of size k − 2, and e ∈ S \ A,

αA∪{e} = (−1)d(t+1)αAfA(e),

where d is the number of elements of A that come after e in the ordering.

Proof.

If e 6∈ F then F \ (A ∪ {e}) = F \ A and A ∩ F = (A ∪ {e}) ∩ F is immediate. We
have to reorder the numerator of αAfA(e) so that it coincides with αA∪{e}. Then we can write
αA∪{e} in place of αAfA(e). By Lemma 3.1, this changes the sign by

(−1)m(t+1),

where m is the number of elements of A \ F that come after e in the ordering. Since e 6∈ F ,
and the elements of F come ﬁrst in the ordering, m is the number of elements of A that come
after e in the ordering. Therefore, m = d and this case is done.

If e ∈ F then we have to reorder the denominator of αA to move the e ∈ F \ A so that it is
zr. Then, up to getting the sign right, we are able to write αA∪{e} in place of αAfA(e), since
the fA(e) cancels with one in the denominator. Note that e ∈ F ∩ (A ∪ {e}).

This reordering, according to Lemma 3.1, changes the sign by

(−1)m1(t+1),

where m1 is the number of elements of F \ (A ∪ {e}) which come after e in the ordering.

Note that |F \ (A ∪ {e})| = |F \ A| − 1, so we have to decrease r by 1 when we replace
αAfA(e) by αA∪{e}, while s increases by the number of elements of F \ (A ∪ {e}) which come
before e in the ordering plus the number of elements of F ∩ A that come after e in the ordering.

EXTENDING SMALL ARCS TO LARGE ARCS

Page 9 of 14

So, all in all, the sign changes by

(−1)(|F \(A∪{e})|+m2−1)(t+1)

where m2 is the number of elements of F ∩ A = (F \ {e}) ∩ A that come after e in the ordering.
Since the elements of F come ﬁrst in the ordering and e ∈ F , we have that m3 = |(F \ {e}) ∩
A| − m2 is the number of elements of A that come before e in the ordering. Therefore, the sign
changes by

The lemma follows since d = k − 2 − m3 and |F \ {e}| = k − 3.

(−1)(|F \{e}|+m3−1)(t+1).

Lemma 3.3. Let S be an arbitrarily ordered arc of size q + k − 1 − t and let E be a subset

of S of size k + t. For any subset A of E of size k − 2,

X αC Yu∈E\C

det(u, C)−1 = 0,

where the sum runs over the subsets C of E of size k − 1 containing A.

Proof. By Lemma 2.4, since E is a subset of S of size t + k containing A,

Xe∈E\A

fA(e) Yu∈E\(A∪{e})

det(u, e, A)−1 = 0.

Observe that

det(u, e, A) = (−1)k−2 det(u, A, e) = (−1)k−2+d det(u, A ∪ {e}),

where d is the number of elements of A which come after e in the ordering. Since there are
t + 1 terms in the product, when we multiply by αA and apply Lemma 3.2, the lemma follows.

4. Proofs of Theorem 1.1, Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4

Let n be a non-negative integer and let G be an arc of Vk(Fq) of size at least k + n. Order

the elements of G arbitrarily and let F be the set of the ﬁrst k − 2 vectors of G.

Recall that we deﬁned the matrix Mn as follows. For each subset E of G of size |G| − n and
subset A of E of size k − 2, we get a column of the matrix Mn, whose rows are indexed by
subsets C of G of size k − 1, where a (C, (A, E)) entry is

Yu∈G\E

det(u, C),

if and only if A ⊂ C and zero otherwise.

Let vG be a vector whose coordinates are indexed by the subsets C of G of size k − 1 and

whose C coordinate is

αC Yz∈G\C

det(z, C)−1.

Lemma 4.1.

If G can be extended to an arc of size q + 2k + n − 1 − |G| then vGMn = 0.

Proof. Suppose that G can be extended to S, an arc of size q + 2k + n − 1 − |G|. Let
t = |G| − k − n. For each subset E of G of size k + t, the equation in Lemma 3.3 for a subset

Page 10 of 14

SIMEON BALL

A of E of size k − 2, is the equation obtained by multiplying vG with the (A, E) column of
Mn.

Proof.

(of Theorem 1.1). If there is a vector of weight one in the column space of Mn then

the scalar product of this vector with vG, according to Lemma 4.1, gives us the equation

αC Yz∈G\C

det(z, C)−1 = 0,

for some subset C of G of size k − 1. This is a contradiction, since all terms in this product
are non-zero.

Proof.

(of Theorem 1.2) Let A be a subset of G of size k − 2 and let S be an arc of size

q + 2k + n − 1 − |G| containing G. As before, let t = q + k − 1 − |S|, so |G| = k + t + n.

Since (G, n) has property W there are elements x, y1, . . . , yt+1 of G and vectors u1, . . . , ut+1
in the column space of Mn, where ui has non-zero C coordinates if and only if C = A ∪ {x} or
C = A ∪ {yi}. By Lemma 4.1, the scalar product of ui with vG, gives the equation

αA∪{x} Yz∈G\A∪{x}

det(z, A ∪ {x})−1 = aiαA∪{yi} Yz∈G\A∪{yi}

det(z, A ∪ {yi})−1,

for some ai ∈ Fq.

By Lemma 3.2, this determines

fA(yi)
fA(x)

,

so this quantity is determined by G. Hence, G determines the value of

fA(X)
fA(x)

at t + 1 linearly independent points. Since fA(X) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree t,
this determines fA(X), so G determines fA(X). Each factor of fA(X) must be a linear form α,
where ker α is a hyperplane intersecting S in A. Therefore, G determines all these hyperplanes,
which is what we wanted to prove.

Proof.

(of Theorem 1.4) The algebraic hypersurface φS can be constructed from a subset
E of S of size k + t − 1 if q is even and size k + 2t − 1 if q is odd, if one knows all the co-
secants to S containing A for every subset A of E, see [4] or Section 5. In Section 5 we give an
explicit description of φS. The condition 2n > |G| − k − 1 implies |G| > |E| if q is odd, so by
Theorem 1.2 we can construct φS.

5. The algebraic hypersurface associated with an arc

In this section we explicitly construct the algebraic hypersurface φS associated with an arc

S of Vk(Fq), introduced in [4].

As before, let t = q + k − 1 − |S|. Let E be a subset of S of size k + t − 1 is q is even and
k + 2t − 1 if q is odd. To able to ﬁnd such an E, and therefore construct φS, this imposes a
lower bound on the size of S.

For q even, deﬁne a polynomial in k − 1 vector variables, so k(k − 1) indeterminates,

φS(Y1, . . . , Yk−1) = XC

αC Yz∈E\C

det(z, Y1, . . . , Yk−1)

det(z, C)

,

where the sum runs over all subsets C of size k − 1 of E.

EXTENDING SMALL ARCS TO LARGE ARCS

Page 11 of 14

For q odd, deﬁne a polynomial in k − 1 vector variables,

φS(Y1, . . . , Yk−1) = XC

α2

C Yz∈E\C

det(z, Y1, . . . , Yk−1)

det(z, C)

,

where the sum runs over all subsets C of size k − 1 of E.

Although φS is deﬁned as a polynomial in k − 1 vector variables, a simple change of variables

shows that in fact it can be written as a polynomial in k indeterminates. Let

Zi = (−1)i−1 det(Y1, . . . , Yk−1),

where the i-th coordinate of Yj has been deleted, so the determinant is of a (k − 1) × (k − 1)
matrix. Then

φS = φS(Z1, . . . , Zk).

Let {c1, . . . , ck−1} be a set of k − 1 linearly independent vectors of Vk(Fq). With Yj = cj for
j = 1, . . . , k − 1, this deﬁnes zi = Zi, for i = 1, . . . , k. The vector (z1, . . . , zk) is a vector in the
dual space, dual to the hyperplane spanned by {c1, . . . , ck−1}. Suppose that {c1, . . . , ck−1} spans
a co-secant hyperplane to S. Then (c1, . . . , ck−1) = (x, a1, . . . , ak−2), where A = {a1, . . . , ak−2}
is a subset of S and x is a zero of fA(X), for some subset A of S. By Theorem 5.1, the vector
(z1, . . . , zk) is a zero of φS and if q is odd, it is a zero of multiplicity two on the line dual to
the subspace spanned by A. This is precisely the properties that the hypersurface constructed
by Blokhuis, Bruen and Thas in [4] has. Therefore, we have an explicit description of this
hypersurface in terms of the αC ’s.

Theorem 5.1. For any subset A = {a1, . . . , ak−2} of S of size k − 2

if q is even and

if q is odd.

φS(X, a1, . . . , ak−2) = αAfA(X),

φS(X, a1, . . . , ak−2) = α2

AfA(X)2,

Proof. Suppose q is even. If A is a subset of E then

φS(X, a1, . . . , ak−2) = Xe∈E\A

αA∪{e} Yz∈E\(A∪{e})

det(z, X, A)
det(z, e, A)

.

By Lemma 3.2, αA∪{e} = αAfA(e). Therefore, by Lemma 2.3,

φS(X, a1, . . . , ak−2) = αAfA(X).

Suppose |A ∩ E| = k − 2 − j.
The above proves the theorem for j = 0 and now we proceed by induction on j.
Let x, y ∈ E \ A and a ∈ A \ E. Since q is even, φS(x, A) = φS(a, (A \ {a}) ∪ {x}). By

induction,

φS(a, (A \ {a}) ∪ {x}) = α(A\{a})∪{x}f(A\{a})∪{x}(a) = αA∪{x} = αAfA(x),

where the last two equalities use Lemma 3.2. Hence,

and

φS(x, A) = αAfA(x),

φS(y, A)
φS(x, A)

=

fA(y)
fA(x)

.

Page 12 of 14

Thus, the evaluation of

fA(x)

φS(x, A)

φS(X, A)

is the evaluation of fA(X) at all points of E \ A. Now, we argue as in Lemma 2.3. Both
are homogeneous polynomials of degree t which, with respect to a basis containing A, are
polynomials in two variables. Since they agree at at least t + 1 linearly independent points
they are the same. We have already observed that φS(x, A) = αAfA(x), which completes the
proof.

Suppose q is odd. If A is a subset of E then

φS(X, a1, . . . , ak−2) = Xe∈E\A
A∪{e} = α2

By Lemma 3.2, α2
independent points,

α2

A∪{e} Yz∈E\(A∪{e})

det(z, X, A)
det(z, e, A)

.

AfA(e)2 so, as in Lemma 2.3 but interpolating at 2t + 1 linearly

φS(X, a1, . . . , ak−2) = α2

AfA(X)2.

Suppose |A ∩ E| = k − 2 − j.
The above proves the theorem for j = 0 and now we proceed by induction on j.
Let x, y ∈ E \ A and a ∈ A \ E. Arguing as in the q even case,

and so

Thus, the evaluation of

φS(x, A) = α2

AfA(x)2,

φS(y, A)
φS(x, A)

=

fA(y)2
fA(x)2 .

fA(x)2
φS(x, A)

φS(X, A)

is the evaluation of fA(X)2 at all points of E \ A. Now, we argue as in Lemma 2.3. Both
are homogeneous polynomials of degree 2t which, with respect to a basis containing A, are
polynomials in two variables. Since they agree at at least 2t + 1 linearly independent points
they are the same.

Theorem 5.2.

If q is even then the dimension of the null space of the row space of Mn is

(cid:18)|G| − n − 1
k − 1 (cid:19).

Furthermore, the hypotheses in Theorem 1.1, Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4 are never satisﬁed,
apart from in the case |G| = k + n where the hypotheses of Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.4 are
trivially satisﬁed.

Proof. Let E be a subset of G of size k + t − 1, where t = |G| − n − k. For any choice of

αC , where C is a subset of E of size k − 1, we deﬁne

φ(Y1, . . . , Yk−1) = XC⊂E

αC Yz∈E\C

det(z, Y1, . . . , Yk−1)

det(z, C)

,

where the sum runs over all subsets of size k − 1 of E.

Deﬁne fA(X) = φ(X, A) for each subset A of G of size k − 2, and from this we deﬁne αC for
all C ⊂ G, as before. With respect to a basis containing A, fA(X) is a homogeneous polynomial

EXTENDING SMALL ARCS TO LARGE ARCS

Page 13 of 14

of degree t in two variables, so satisﬁes Lemma 2.3. Moreover fD∪{x}(y) = φ(D, x, y), so

fD∪{x}(y)
fD∪{y}(x)

= 1,

so Lemma 3.1 is also satisﬁed. Lemma 3.3 is derived from these two lemmas, so we conclude
that Lemma 3.3 holds for these fA. Since Lemma 3.3 gives the set of equations deﬁned by Mn
(see Lemma 4.1), the vector vG, whose coordinates are indexed by the subsets C of G of size
k − 1 and whose C coordinate is

αC Yz∈G\C

det(z, C)−1,

is in the null space of the row space of Mn.

Thus, the dimension of the null space of the row space of Mn is at least (cid:0)|G|−n−1
k−1 (cid:1).

Suppose that v is in the null space of the row space of Mn and let αC be deﬁned by

(v)C = αC Yz∈G\C

det(z, C)−1.

Let E be a subset of G of size k + t − 1 and deﬁne

φ(Y1, . . . , Yk−1) = XC

αC Yz∈E\C

det(z, Y1, . . . , Yk−1)

det(z, C)

,

where the sum runs over all subsets of size k − 1 of E. For any C ⊂ E, φ(C) = αC .

Moreover, since v is in the null space of the row space of Mn we have that the equation in
Lemma 3.3 holds. This implies that for any C where |C ∩ E| = k − 2, φ(C) = αC . Therefore
the αC ’s, where C ⊂ E determine αC where |C ∩ E| = k − 2. Now we can deduce that αC ,
where C ⊂ E′ is determined by the same αC ’s, when |E′ ∩ E| = k + t − 2 and extrapolate to
deduce that all αC ’s are determined by the αC ’s, where C ⊂ E.

If Mn has a vector of weight one in its column space then this forces αC = 0 for some C,

Thus, the dimension of the null space of the row space of Mn is at most (cid:0)|G|−n−1
k−1 (cid:1).
which would make the dimension of the row space of Mn strictly less than (cid:0)|G|−n−1
k−1 (cid:1). If Mn

has property W then there is a C and a C′, subsets of G of size k − 1, intersecting in k − 2
vectors, such that αC = aα′
C , for some a ∈ Fq. This would impose a condition on the null space
of the row space and again imply that the dimension of the row space of Mn is strictly less

than (cid:0)|G|−n−1
k−1 (cid:1).

6. Conclusions

Although the proofs are quite technical, the main results in this article are easily stated and
potentially useful. Given an arc G in a space of odd characteristic, one can quickly determine
an upper bound on how large an arc one can hope to extend it to. This is done by increasing n
one by one to obtain the minimum n0 such that Mn0+1 has a vector of weight one in its column
space. Then Theorem 1.1 implies that G cannot be extended to an arc of size q + 2k + n0 − |G|.
If (G, n0) satisﬁes property W and S is an arc of size q + 2k − n0 − 1 − |G| containing G then,
by Theorem 1.2, we can determine the co-secants to S containing only points of G. Furthermore,
if 2n0 > |G| − k − 1 then, by Theorem 1.4, we can determine the algebraic hypersurface φS
associated with S.

It should be possible to prove explicit upper bounds if one assumes that G has some structure.
For example one might assume that in the planar case when k is three, G is contained in a
cubic curve, or all but one or a few of the points of G are contained in a conic. Likewise, for
general k one might assume that G is contained in a normal rational curve or all but one or a
few of the points of G are contained in a normal rational curve. Using this structure one may

Page 14 of 14

then be able to calculate the column space of Mn. If this is possible, one may also be able to
determine precisely the large arcs to which G extends. There should be many results of this
type.
