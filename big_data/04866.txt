ABSTRACT
Supernova (SN) 2015U (also known as PSN J07285387+3349106) was discovered
in NGC 2388 on 2015 Feb. 11. A rapidly evolving and luminous event, it showed
hydrogen-free spectra dominated by relatively narrow helium P-Cygni spectral fea-
tures and it was classiﬁed as a SN Ibn. In this paper we present photometric, spectro-
scopic, and spectropolarimetric observations of SN 2015U, including a Keck/DEIMOS
spectrum (resolution ≈ 5000) which fully resolves the optical emission and absorption
features. We ﬁnd that SN 2015U is best understood via models of shock breakout from
extended and dense circumstellar material (CSM), likely created by a history of mass
loss from the progenitor with an extreme outburst within ∼ 1–2 yr of core collapse
(but we do not detect any outburst in our archival imaging of NGC 2388). We argue
that the high luminosity of SN 2015U was powered not through 56Ni decay but via
the deposition of kinetic energy into the ejecta/CSM shock interface, and we place
an upper limit on the amount of 56Ni synthesized by SN 2015U: M(56Ni) < 0.019 M(cid:12).
Though our analysis is hampered by strong host-galaxy dust obscuration (which likely
exhibits multiple components), our dataset makes SN 2015U one of the best-studied
Type Ibn supernovae and provides a bridge of understanding to other rapidly fading
transients, both luminous and relatively faint.

1 INTRODUCTION

Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are luminous explosions
that mark the end of a massive star’s life. These SNe are
diﬀerentiated from their thermonuclear counterparts (Type
Ia SNe) and are grouped into classes via spectral and pho-
tometric analyses (e.g., Filippenko 1997). The major core-
collapse subclasses include SNe IIP and IIL, events which
show strong hydrogen throughout their evolution and re-
spectively do or do not exhibit a hydrogen-recombination
plateau in their light curves (though the distinction between
SNe IIP and IIL may be less clear than previously thought;
e.g., Arcavi et al. 2012; Anderson et al. 2014; Sanders et al.
2015). SNe Ib and Ic (often called stripped-envelope SNe) are
core-collapse events that show no hydrogen in their spectra
and (for SNe Ic and broad-lined SNe Ic) no helium; they

(along with the intermediate SNe IIb, which exhibit very
little hydrogen) are commonly understood to arise from pro-
genitor stars that have lost all or most of their hydrogen (and
perhaps helium) envelopes prior to core collapse, though
the detailed connections between progenitors and SN ob-
servables remain somewhat uncertain (e.g., Matheson et al.
2001; Drout et al. 2011; Bianco et al. 2014; Modjaz et al.
2014; Liu et al. 2015; Dessart et al. 2015).

A subset of SNe reveal signatures of a dense shroud of
circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding their progenitors
at the time of explosion. For hydrogen-rich events, relatively
narrow lines (full width at half-maximum intensity [FWHM]
(cid:46) 1000 km s−1) from this interaction with the CSM are of-
ten detected; these objects have been dubbed SNe IIn (e.g.,
Schlegel 1990; Filippenko 1991). This interaction can pro-
vide a signiﬁcant luminosity boost (as has been observed
for superluminous SNe IIn; e.g., Gal-Yam 2012). CSM inter-
action occurs in some hydrogen-poor SNe as well. SNe Ia-

CSM are thermonuclear events that exhibit relatively narrow
features (usually Hα emission) caused by interaction with
hydrogen-rich CSM (though the underlying SN ejecta are
hydrogen-poor; e.g., Silverman et al. 2013b,a). A small num-
ber of stripped-envelope SNe have been found to exhibit the
spectral signatures of CSM interaction. SNe Ibn (e.g., Foley
et al. 2007; Pastorello et al. 2008) show relatively narrow
helium lines in their spectra but no hydrogen, and they can
be quite heterogeneous in their photometric evolution (e.g.,
Pastorello et al. 2016), while the remarkable SN 2014C ap-
peared to be a normal SN Ib at peak brightness but then
began interacting with hydrogen-rich CSM only few months
later (Milisavljevic et al. 2015).

In addition to the examples of interaction with dense
CSM described above, indications of very short-lived inter-
action with CSM have been discovered through “ﬂash spec-
troscopy” of very young SNe of various types (e.g., Gal-
Yam et al. 2014; Shivvers et al. 2015; Khazov et al. 2016).
These examples exist on a continuum of CSM densities with
the strongly interacting events described above; they require
much less CSM and their observables at peak generally align
with those of “normal” events.

Here we present the results of our observational cam-
paign to study SN 2015U: a remarkable and very well-
studied SN Ibn. It was discovered in NGC 2388 by the Lick
Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) and the 0.76 m Katz-
man Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT; Filippenko et al.
2001) on 2015 Feb. 11 (all dates and times reported herein
are in UT). Note that, because the oﬃcial International As-
tronomical Union name was not assigned until November of
2015 (Kumar et al. 2015), this event has also been discussed
in the literature under the name PSN J07285387+3349106.
Ochner et al. (2015) classiﬁed it as a young SN Ibn based
upon spectra obtained on Feb. 18, which showed a blue con-
tinuum and relatively narrow He I emission features (see also
Kumar et al. 2015). Tsvetkov et al. (2015) present BVRI
photometry of SN 2015U starting Feb. 17, showing that it
has one of the fastest decline rates known (similar to those
SNe 2002bj, 2005ek, and 2010X) and is remarkably luminous
(though SN 2015U is signiﬁcantly obscured by an uncertain
amount of dust in the host galaxy). Pastorello et al. (2015)
present additional photometry and low-resolution spectra
of this event and describe SN 2015U within the context of
SNe Ibn (e.g., Foley et al. 2007; Pastorello et al. 2008, 2016).

In this paper we present photometric, spectroscopic,
and spectropolarimetric observations of SN 2015U, including
one epoch of relatively high-resolution Keck DEIMOS spec-
troscopy (R = λ/δλ ≈ 5000), enabling us to study the narrow-
line features in detail. We show that SN 2015U is similar to
several other SNe from the heterogeneous SN Ibn class, and
that it shares many features with the rapid and luminous
transients discovered in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) archives
(Drout et al. 2014), those found in the SuperNova Legacy
Survey (SNLS) archives (Arcavi et al. 2015), and with a few
other rapidly fading SNe from the literature. SN 2015U of-
fers valuable insights into the physics of the poorly observed
class of rapidly fading SNe.

2 OBSERVATIONS

2.1 Photometry

SN 2015U was ﬁrst detected by KAIT on Feb. 11.24 at
18.06±0.15 mag in an unﬁltered image1. An unﬁltered image
taken the night before (Feb. 10.30) shows no source to a limit
of ∼ 18.37 mag. We began acquiring multiband photometry
(BVRI and clear) starting Feb. 14 with KAIT and the 1 m
Nickel telescope at Lick Observatory. We used a set of 8
Nickel images with clear detections of SN 2015U and with
good astrometric solutions for the ﬁeld to calculate an up-
◦
49(cid:48)10.52(cid:48)(cid:48) (J2000),
dated position: α = 07h28m53.89s, δ = +33
oﬀset from the centre of the galaxy by ∼ 6(cid:48)(cid:48). We believe this
position to be accurate within 0.15(cid:48)(cid:48) or better — the posi-
tions we measured for the SN exhibit a scatter of σα = 0.08(cid:48)(cid:48)
and σδ = 0.03(cid:48)(cid:48) across 8 images.

NCG 2388 and the location of SN 2015U were imaged
in the near-infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
in 2004, but there are no coincident sources detected in the
archival images. Though SN 2015U is one of the nearest
SNe Ibn to date (Pastorello et al. 2016), it is still much
too distant for our nondetection to place interesting con-
straints on a putative progenitor. Under our Cycle 23 Snap-
shot program with HST’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3;
GO-14149, PI Filippenko), we obtained images of the SN
location on 2016 Feb. 14 (1 yr post explosion) through the
F555W (710 s) and F814W (780 s) ﬁlters. SN 2015U is not
detected in these images, but we do ﬁnd that it exploded on
the trailing edge of the approaching spiral arm of NGC 2388,
in a region with several probable dust lanes and a generally
clumpy appearance. NGC 2388 is a strongly star-forming
and massive galaxy — Pereira-Santaella et al. (2015) calcu-
late an ongoing star-formation rate of ∼ 40+9−22 M(cid:12) yr−1 and
a total stellar mass of 1011.0±0.1 M(cid:12) — but SN 2015U is not
obviously associated with the brightest star-forming regions
of the galaxy. Figure 1 displays a Nickel V-band detection
of SN 2015U and our HST F555W image of the SN site.

Ganeshalingam et al. (2010) describe our photometric
observing program at Lick in detail. KAIT and Nickel im-
ages were reduced using our image-reduction pipeline (Gane-
shalingam et al. 2010). Point-spread-function photometry
was then performed using DAOPHOT (Stetson 1987) from
the IDL Astronomy User’s Library.2 Instrumental magni-
tudes were calibrated to several nearby stars from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, transformed into the Landolt system us-
ing the empirical prescription presented by Robert Lupton.3
Figure 2 shows our light curves of SN 2015U; upon publica-
tion the data will be available for download from the Berke-
ley SuperNova DataBase (SNDB; Silverman et al. 2012).4

We measure the time of peak of SN 2015U’s brightness
in each passband of our Nickel+KAIT photometry by ﬁt-
ting a low-order polynomial to the light curve within the
ﬁrst week (ﬁrst 10 days for I) and use Monte Carlo Markov
Chain (MCMC) methods to estimate our uncertainties. In

absolute-magnitude corrections.

2.2 Spectroscopy

We began a spectral monitoring campaign of SN 2015U
on 2015 Feb. 15, obtaining six spectra with the Kast dou-
ble spectrograph (Miller & Stone 1993) on the Shane 3 m
telescope at Lick Observatory and one spectrum with the
DEIMOS spectrograph (Faber et al. 2003) on the Keck II
10 m telescope. Details of our spectral observations are listed
in Table 1, and all reductions and calibrations were per-
formed with standard tools and methods, including IRAF
routines and custom Python and IDL code5 (e.g., Matheson
et al. 2000; P´erez & Granger 2007; Silverman et al. 2012).

All spectra were taken at or near the parallactic angle
(Filippenko 1982), and the amount of galaxy ﬂux falling into
the slit varied as a function of seeing and the slit orientation
on the sky. For the spectra which included a large amount
of host-galaxy ﬂux (Feb. 18, 21, and 24), we extract a spec-
trum from a region of the galaxy that does not include any
SN 2015U ﬂux, perform a median-ﬁlter smoothing to obtain
the galaxy continuum, and then subtract it from our spectra,
after determining a best-ﬁt galaxy scaling coeﬃcient by com-
paring synthetic photometry to the (template-subtracted)
multiband photometry observed the same night. We do not
attempt to remove the narrow (unresolved) galaxy emission
features, so our spectra show varying degrees of narrow-line
contamination from the host (including Hα, Hβ, and [S II]).
We renormalise each spectrum to match our template-
subtracted V or R-band photometry (depending on the spec-
tral wavelength coverage) after linearly interpolating the
photometry to the time of spectral observation. Figure 3
shows our total-ﬂux spectra of SN 2015U. Upon publication
all spectra will be available to download from the Berke-

band peak is shown along the top while the absolute magnitude
is shown on the right. Because these absolute magnitudes have
not been corrected for signiﬁcant but uncertain dust absorption
arising within the host galaxy, they can be taken as lower limits
on the luminosity of SN 2015U.

lates into a luminosity distance of 58.9 Mpc (Wright 2006)

Using narrow Hα host emission in our DEIMOS spec-
trum we measure a line-of-sight redshift at the SN’s loca-
tion: zSN = 0.013161 ± 0.000005, a diﬀerence of ∼ 200 km s−1
from the published redshift of the host galaxy — consistent
with the SN’s position on the approaching arm of this spiral
galaxy.

2.3 Spectropolarimetry

spectropolarimetry were obtained of
Three epochs of
SN 2015U near peak brightness utilising the dual-beam po-
larimetry mode of the Lick Kast spectrograph. The orienta-
tion of the slit on the sky was always set to a position angle
of 180◦ (i.e., aligned north-south), and exposures of 900 s
were obtained at each of four waveplate positions (0.◦0, 45.◦0,
22.◦5, and 67.◦5). On each night, several waveplate sequences
were performed and coadded. Flatﬁeld and arc-lamp spec-
tra were obtained immediately after each sequence without
moving the telescope.
For polarimetric calibrations, the low-polarization stan-
dard stars BD+32◦3739 and BD+05◦2618 were observed to
verify the low instrumental polarization of the Kast spectro-
graph. We constrained the average fractional Stokes Q and
U values to < 0.1%. By observing the above unpolarized
standard stars through a 100% polarizing ﬁlter we deter-
mined that the polarimetric response is so close to 100%
that no correction was necessary. Finally, we obtained the
instrumental polarization position-angle curve and used it
to correct the data. We observed the high-polarization stars

6 http://wiserep.weizmann.ac.il/

HD 19820, BD +59◦389, and V1Cyg12 to obtain the zero-
point of the polarization position angle on the sky (θ) and to
determine the accuracy of polarimetric measurements, which
were generally consistent with previously published values
within ∆P < 0.05% and ∆θ < 1◦. All spectropolarimetric re-
ductions and calculations were performed using the methods
described by Mauerhan et al. (2015, and references therein),
and we deﬁne the polarimetric parameters in the same man-
ner as those authors (Stokes parameters q and u, debiased
polarization P, and sky position angle θ).

To probe the Galactic component of interstellar polar-
ization (ISP) along the line of sight toward SN 2015U, we
used the method of spectroscopic parallax to select three
stars within 1◦ of separation from the source and measured
their integrated V-band polarization (P) and position an-
gle (θ). For HD 58221 we obtained P = 0.28%±0.01%, θ =
13.0◦ ± 0.6◦; for HD 58726, P = 0.50%±0.01%, θ = 24.8◦ ± 0.3◦;
and for HD 59291, P = 0.24%±0.01%, θ = 16.3◦ ± 0.7◦ (uncer-
tainties are statistical). We interpret the signiﬁcantly higher
value of P for HD 58726 (A0 V spectral type) as being caused
by some intrinsic polarization for that star, so we used the
average values of the other two stars (0.25%, 14.3◦) to calcu-
late the associated Serkowski-Whittet form (Serkowski et al.
1975; Whittet et al. 1992), assuming a total-to-selective ex-
tinction ratio of RV = 3.1 and that the polarization peaks at
5500 ˚A, values appropriate for the Milky Way (MW). The
resulting curve was subtracted from the SN 2015U data to
remove the small but nonnegligible Galactic component of
ISP. The above observations (along with calibration obser-
vations of the low-polarization standard star HD 14069 and
the high-polarization standards HD 245310 and HD 25443)
were taken with the Kast spectrograph on 2015 Sep. 21.

3 ANALYSIS

3.1 Dust Corrections

All observations of SN 2015U are heavily aﬀected by an ob-
scuring screen of dust present in the host galaxy, NGC 2388.
Because the treatment of dust corrections aﬀects much of
the following discussion, we start by describing our eﬀorts
to understand, characterise, and correct for the eﬀects of
the host-galaxy dust. First, however, we correct for MW
dust along the line of sight using the dust maps of Schlaﬂy
& Finkbeiner (2011, E(B − V) = 0.0498 mag) and assuming
RV = 3.1 (Cardelli et al. 1989).

Ochner et al. (2015) note that a signiﬁcant amount of
host-galaxy reddening is apparent in their classiﬁcation spec-
trum, with an estimated E(B − V) = 1.0 mag based upon
the Na I D feature. Our higher-resolution DEIMOS spectrum
from Feb. 27 reveals complex Na I D absorption near the host
redshift (we examine the structure of this feature in §3.2.3).
We measure the equivalent width (EW) of the entire absorp-
tion complex to be 9.1 ± 0.15 ˚A — well outside the empir-
ical relations of Poznanski et al. (2012) and similar previ-
ous eﬀorts, which show that the Na I D lines saturate and
lose their predictive power above a total EW of ∼ 2 ˚A and
E(B−V) ≈ 1.0 mag. This indicates that the reddening toward
SN 2015U likely exhibits E(B − V) > 1.0 mag, if the dust in
NGC 2388 is similar to that in our MW.
Pastorello et al. (2015) measure an Na I D EW of 6.5 ±
0.5 ˚A from their spectra; we tentatively suggest that the dis-
crepancy between their value and ours is caused by diﬀerent
choices made when deﬁning the local continuum. Figure 6
shows that the Na I D components fall on the red wing of
the He I emission line, even at early times. However, if one
instead deﬁnes the local continuum based upon the over-
all ﬂux-density level (a reasonable choice if the emission-line
wings were not detected), one obtains Na I D EW values sim-
ilar to those of Pastorello et al. (2015).

We next examined the 5870.5 ˚A diﬀuse interstellar band
(DIB). This feature is one of the strongest DIBs; it has long
been known to correlate with extinction in the MW when
the Na I D feature is saturated (e.g., Herbig 1995; Fried-

MNRAS 000, 1–18 (2016)

man et al. 2011; Lan et al. 2015), and Phillips et al. (2013)
show a clear correlation between this feature and the red-
dening toward SNe Ia produced by host-galaxy dust. We
do not detect this feature, and our spectra have insuﬃcient
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to place strong constraints on
the dust using our nondetection. We also examined mod-
eled estimates for the amount of dust obscuring the bulk of
stars in the host galaxy NGC 2388 (Pereira-Santaella et al.
2015), and we determined the same value at the location of
the SN (within ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48) on the sky) by measuring the Balmer
ratio implied by the Hα and Hβ galaxy lines present in our
DEIMOS spectrum (e.g., Brocklehurst 1971). We estimate
E(B − V) ≈ 0.56 and 1.1 mag, respectively, toward the aver-
age star in NGC 2388’s core and the average star near the
explosion site of SN 2015U. Although this does not provide
a measure of the line-of-sight reddening toward SN 2015U
speciﬁcally, it does provide valuable context about the dust
content of NGC 2388.

Additional information is available to us through the
spectropolarimetry: as we describe in §3.2.4, the peak of the
polarization spectrum (λmax) of NGC 2388’s ISM is blue-
ward of 4600 ˚A. The shapes of the polarization law and
the dust-extinction law are related within the MW (e.g.,
Serkowski et al. 1975; Clayton & Mathis 1988). Using RV =
(−0.29±0.74)+(6.67±1.17) λmax from Clayton & Mathis (1988,
with λmax in µm), our measurement of λmax < 0.46 µm implies
RV < 2.8 ± 0.9. However, note that Patat et al. (2015) show
the polarization properties of the host-galaxy dust obscuring
several well-studied and reddened SNe Ia to be remarkably
diﬀerent from those of the dust in our MW.

Finally, we model SN 2015U as a blackbody emitter ob-
scured behind a simple screen of dust in the host galaxy
and ﬁt for the parameters of that dust via comparisons with
our multiband photometry at three epochs (pre-maximum,
maximum, and post-maximum). Our spectra show that the
emission from SN 2015U is roughly that of a blackbody ob-
scured by dust, at least at optical wavelengths (unlike most
SNe, which display spectra consisting of prominent and over-
lapping features with sometimes strong line blanketing), and
in §3.5 we discuss why one would expect roughly black-

weighted least-squares ﬁt to determine the best-ﬁt temper-
ature and luminosity of the source blackbody and we list
the weighted sum of squared diﬀerences (Σσ2) for each. Fig-
ure 4 shows that a nonzero amount of host-galaxy reddening
correction makes the ﬁts worse for RV = 3.1 and 4.0 — in
those cases the photometric data prefer a blackbody with no
dust. However, the spectra clearly show a nonthermal rolloﬀ
at blue wavelengths (see Figure 3), and so there must be
a signiﬁcant amount of dust absorption within NGC 2388.
If we instead adopt RV = 2.1, a grid search over E(B − V)
values indicates a best ﬁt at E(B − V) ≈ 0.94 mag. As Fig-
ure 5 shows, dereddening the spectra for this reddening law
appears to correct the blue rolloﬀ. Figure 4 shows that Σσ2
increases above E(B− V) = 1.0 and below E(B− V) = 0.6, but
between those values Σσ2 is only weakly dependent upon
E(B − V). We therefore use Figure 4 to estimate our error
bars: E(B − V) = 0.94+0.1−0.4 mag. A similar approach was taken

by Pastorello et al. (2015), who compared the colour curves
of SN 2015U to the intrinsic colour curves of other SNe Ibn
to obtain E(B − V)tot = 0.81 ± 0.21 mag (assuming RV = 3.1).
However, as they note, the SN Ibn subclass is remarkably
heterogeneous, and it is not clear whether the physics gov-
erning those colour curves is the same for all members.

Figure 4. In the top panel, we ﬁt reddened blackbodies to our
photometry of SN 2015U at three epochs (blue, Feb. 14.35; green,
Feb. 18.21; red, Feb. 27.21) after correcting for MW absorption
and assuming various values for RV and E(B−V) within NGC 2388.
For many data points, the measurement errors are smaller than
the plotted symbol. The weighted sum of squared diﬀerences
(Σσ2) between observed photometric points and synthetic pho-
tometry of a blackbody is shown in the upper right of each plot;
lower values indicate a better agreement across all epochs. In the
bottom panel, we show Σσ2 as a function of E(B−V) for RV = 2.1 in
black as well as Σσ2 broken down by individual epochs, coloured
as above. RV = 2.1 and E(B − V) = 0.94+0.1−0.4 mag (marked with a

dashed line in the bottom panel) are the preferred values. In many
panels a blue feature is introduced into the reddened blackbody
spectrum by the wavelength dependency of the MW’s reddening
law, but our spectral data provide no clear evidence for or against
such a feature in the spectra of SN 2015U.

body emission from SN 2015U. We use PySynphot7 and as-
sume the dust is described by the empirical extinction law
of Cardelli et al. (1989) — by varying the parameters RV
and E(B − V) we are able to explore a wide variety of dust
populations and search for the parameters that produce the
best blackbody ﬁts to our photometric data.

Figure 4 shows a comparison between synthetic pho-
tometry from PySynphot and the photometry assuming four
diﬀerent values for E(B− V) ranging from 0.0 mag to 1.0 mag
and three diﬀerent reddening laws parameterised by RV from
2.1 to 4.0 (note that PySynphot only includes a few built-in
options for RV ; we explore the most relevant of them here).
For every combination of RV and E(B − V) we perform a

Given the above discussion, we adopt RV = 2.1 and
E(B − V) = 0.94+0.1−0.4 mag. The large EWs measured from the

Na I D and the odd absorption feature complex indicate that
a simple analysis of those features cannot be trusted. Studies
of the integrated galaxy ﬂux and the Balmer decrement mea-
sured from our spectrum show that the bulk of NGC 2388’s
stellar mass is strongly obscured, and our spectropolarimet-
ric data indicate that SN 2015U itself exploded behind a sig-
niﬁcant dust screen. The low λmax value in the polarization
spectrum and our blackbody ﬁts to the light curves together
prefer a relatively wavelength-dependent dust extinction law

for NGC 2388 (i.e., RV < 3.1) and E(B − V) = 0.94+0.1−0.4 mag —
we ﬁnd this line of reasoning most convincing. The above re-
sult is consistent with the E(B−V) = 0.99±0.48 mag adopted
by Pastorello et al. (2015), though they assume RV = 3.1.
Our determination of the dust properties toward SN 2015U
remains uncertain, so we consider a range of plausible red-
dening corrections throughout the rest of this paper. We ﬁnd
that the extinction toward §3.2.3 does not appear to change
over the course of our observations, and we discuss and reject
the possibility that a signiﬁcant fraction of the extinction to-
ward SN 2015U arises from the SN’s CSM rather than the
host galaxy’s ISM.

3.2 Spectra

The spectra of SN 2015U show a strong continuum over-
lain with narrow and intermediate-width emission features.
Though our data cover only 12 days of SN 2015U’s evolu-
tion, they range from a pre-maximum spectrum to one taken
after the SN had faded from peak by ∼ 1 mag (see Figure 2).
No broad ejecta features became apparent in our spectra
throughout that timespan — markedly diﬀerent behaviour
from that of the well-observed, rapidly fading SNe 2002bj,
2005ek, and 2010X (Poznanski et al. 2010; Drout et al. 2013;
Kasliwal et al. 2010) and similar to that of the interacting
SN 2010jl (e.g., Fransson et al. 2014). Though broad features
do not emerge, the continuum temperature shows signiﬁ-
cant evolution, the narrow emission and absorption features

evolve, and the relative ionisation states of the detected el-
ements change. No hydrogen is found, but multiple ionisa-
tion levels of helium, nitrogen, iron, and perhaps oxygen and
carbon are detected, some in both emission and absorption
and some in absorption only. Pastorello et al. (2015) also
present a series of spectral observations of SN 2015U. Their

data are in good agreement with ours and extend to later
epochs, while our (higher-resolution) spectra illustrate new

3.2.1 Evolving Line Proﬁles

The most obvious features in our spectra are emission lines
of He I. These lines are centred at the rest wavelength, show
a relatively broad base with a full width near zero intensity
(FWZI) of ∼ 9000–10,000 km s−1, and are overlain with P-
Cygni absorption features blueshifted by ∼ 745 km s−1 and
with widths of 400–500 km s−1. The wavelengths and widths
of these features do not signiﬁcantly change during the ∼ 12
days covered by our spectra. We ﬁnd that the He I line pro-
ﬁles can be parameterised by a “modiﬁed Lorentzian” emis-
sion component (where the exponent is allowed to vary) with
a suppressed blue wing and an overlain Gaussian absorption
component, indicative of recombination lines broadened via
electron scattering within the CSM. SN 2015U’s line pro-
ﬁles are very similar to those observed in many SNe IIn but
with a faster inferred CSM velocity (see, e.g., the spectra of
SN 1998S; Leonard et al. 2000; Anupama et al. 2001; Fas-
sia et al. 2001; Chugai 2001; Shivvers et al. 2015). Figure 6
shows our best ﬁt to the He I λ5876 line using this parameter-
isation. We also show the unsuppressed Lorentzian feature
to emphasise the asymmetry, which arises from the eﬀects
of Compton scattering within a wind-like CSM (e.g., Auer
& van Blerkom 1972; Hillier 1991; Chugai 2001). The mag-
nitude of the eﬀect scales with the expansion velocity, ex-
plaining the strongly asymmetric emission lines of SN 2015U
compared to those observed in most SNe IIn.

After He I (and host-galaxy Hα and [N II]), the most
clearly detected features in our spectra are the N II lines.
As Pastorello et al. (2015) note, SN 2015U appears to be
the ﬁrst SN Ibn to show these features, though they are
commonly found in the spectra of hot stars. In our DEIMOS
spectrum we are able to identify nine N II absorption lines
(see §3.2.2), and for the strongest of these we track their
evolution throughout our spectral series. In our −2.9 and
+0.1 d spectra, the 5667 ˚A and 5676 ˚A features are apparent
in emission around v ≈ 0 km s−1, but they transition into
absorption at v ≈ 680 km s−1 after maximum light — see
Figure 7. The same trend is apparent in the N II features at
6482 ˚A and 7215 ˚A (Figure 3).

We ﬁnd a strong emission feature centred around 4650 ˚A
in our earliest spectrum. In Figure 3 we label it as a blend
of N III, C III, and He II, a blend that has been observed and
modeled in the spectra of a few other young, interacting SNe
(e.g., Gal-Yam et al. 2014; Shivvers et al. 2015). The 4650 ˚A
emission feature fades rapidly. Given the clear detection of
N II at all epochs we believe the identiﬁcation of N III to be
very robust, but whether the blue wing of that emission fea-
ture is caused by C III or He II is more diﬃcult to determine.
There is abundant helium in SN 2015U, but the energy re-
quired to ionise C III is lower than that of He II, and is nearer
the ionisation energy of N III (Ei = 47.44, 47.88, and 54.42 eV
for N III, C III, and He II, respectively). Discerning between
these ions likely requires detailed modeling and is beyond
the scope of this paper, and so our identiﬁcation of carbon
in the spectra SN 2015U is only tentative.

3.2.2 Higher Resolution
Our DEIMOS spectrum from Feb. 27 (R ≈ 5000) reveals
fully resolved absorption and emission features from a host
of ions in the spectra of SN 2015U; see Figure 8, as well as

Figure 7. The evolution of the N II lines. The spectra increase
in time downward as in Figure 3. Identiﬁed N II lines are shown
at rest with dotted lines and with a blueshift of v = 680 km s−1 in
dashed lines (the mean blueshift of N II lines measured from our
DEIMOS spectrum). The emission features marginally detected
at v = 0 km s−1 in our earliest spectra evolve into blueshifted ab-
sorption lines post-maximum brightness.

Table 2 for their observed properties. We include measured
positions and widths for several lines for which we have no
good identiﬁcation; it is especially diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate
between Fe III (Ei = 30.651 eV) and Fe II (Ei = 16.20 eV).8 In
our spectrum we ﬁnd three probable Fe absorption lines be-
tween 5115 and 5180 ˚A (in the SN rest frame). The stronger
two were identiﬁed as Fe III by Pastorello et al. (2015), but
several known Fe II lines occur at very similar wavelengths.
In addition, we ﬁnd a weaker feature at 5180.3 ˚A. NIST lists
more than 20 Fe II lines between 5190 and 5200 ˚A (implied
Doppler velocities of ∼ 560–1100 km s−1), but only one Fe III
line within the same range at 5199.08 ˚A (v ≈ 1080 km s−1).
If we assume the observed feature arises from Fe III, then
it must be associated with material traveling ∼ 300 km s−1
faster than the rest of the CSM — an unlikely scenario. We
therefore prefer an identiﬁcation of Fe II for all three of these
features, though we do not present Doppler velocities since
they likely arise from several closely spaced lines.

We also ﬁnd three unidentiﬁed emission features in our
DEIMOS spectrum that are not from host-galaxy contam-
ination, falling near 5290, 6165, and 6340 ˚A and exhibiting
widths similar to those of the He I lines. None of these is
clearly detected in our other spectra or the spectra published

Identiﬁcations and properties of the absorption features identiﬁed in our DEIMOS spectrum (after correcting for

z = 0.013161). All lines were ﬁt by a Gaussian with a linear approximation to the nearby continuum, and rest wavelengths
were downloaded from the NIST ASD. Characteristic error bars are ∼ 0.6 ˚A (30 km s−1) for the observed wavelengths and
∼ 1.6 ˚A for the Gaussian FWHM (85 km s−1), as estimated by calculating the 95% conﬁdence intervals for the N II λ5711

line using MCMC techniques.

by Pastorello et al. (2015, though generally they all exhibit
SNRs too low to rule them out). The feature at 6340 ˚A is
suggestive of the [O I] λλ6300, 6364 doublet that regularly
arises in nebular spectra of stripped-envelope SNe (Types
Ib/c; e.g., Filippenko 1997; Matheson 2001), but this iden-
tiﬁcation is only tentative.

3.2.3 The Na D Lines

Our DEIMOS spectrum of SN 2015U reveals a remarkable
set of Na D absorption features — see Figure 9. In addition
to the MW doublet we ﬁnd several overlapping lines from
NGC 2388 along our sight line, though as we show below,

Figure 9. The Na D features in our DEIMOS spectrum of
SN 2015U and NGC 2388. The top panel plots the observed spec-
trum of SN 2015U with our best-ﬁt absorption proﬁles while the
middle panel shows the result after introducing the additional
constraint that D2/D1 ≥ 1.0 (see §3.2.3). The shorter-wavelength
doublet is shown in blue and the longer-wavelength one in red,
with the central wavelengths indicated by dashed and dotted ver-
tical lines for D2 and D1, respectively. Their sum is shown in grey.
The bottom panel shows the 2D frame of our DEIMOS observa-
tion in this region, including both the light from the host and the
SN, as well as a cutout of the Hα emission line (plotted with the
same Doppler δv per pixel) to indicate the shape of the galaxy’s
rotation curve.

there is no evidence that any of these lines originate within
the CSM immediately surrounding SN 2015U. The astro-
nomical Na D doublet has been studied in great detail (it
was one of the original Fraunhofer lines) and the relative
strength of the doublet has long been used to measure the
interstellar abundance of neutral sodium: the Na D2 line is
generally observed to be stronger than the D1 line by a factor
ranging from 1.0 to 2.0, for high and low column densities of
Na I, respectively (e.g., Str¨omgren 1948; Nachman & Hobbs
1973; Somerville 1988). The MW Na D doublet in our spec-
tra exhibits the expected behaviour, with an EW ratio of
D2/D1 ≈ 1.2, but the host-galaxy lines do not.

There are at least two distinct and overlapping Na D
absorption doublets near the host-galaxy’s rest frame in
the spectrum of SN 2015U. Figure 9 shows them (as well
as model ﬁts) in detail. We model the absorption complex
by overlaying the modiﬁed Lorentzian emission-line proﬁle
(see §3.2.1) with two doublets of Voigt absorption proﬁles
(though we note that some of these lines may be unresolved
and saturated). D1 and D2 lines from a single doublet are
forced to have the same velocity properties and to be sepa-
rated by 5.97 ˚A, but they are allowed independent strengths.

In the top panel of Figure 9 we show the result when we
allow the relative strengths of the doublet (i.e., D2/D1) to
vary freely. In the rest frame of the SN, the bluest doublet
falls at λλ5890.45, 5896.35 ±0.066 ˚A. This is a blueshift of
only ∼ 25 km s−1 from the SN rest frame, and so this dou-
blet is likely to arise from the ISM of NGC 2388 along our
sight line to SN 2015U. The second (redder) doublet, how-
ever, falls at λλ5895.80, 5901.69 ±0.063 ˚A — redshifted from
the SN by almost 300 km s−1, and even redshifted from the
galaxy core by more than 100 km s−1. This is within the ve-
locity range of NGC 2388’s rotation curve, but SN 2015U
is located well away from the receding spiral arm and the
bulk of the galaxy’s receding material (see Figure 1). In ad-
dition, the second Na D doublet shows a strength ratio of
D2/D1 ≈ 0.5, well outside the commonly observed values of
∼ 1.0–2.0 (in contrast, the blue doublet exhibits a reasonable
D2/D1 ≈ 1.5).
If, instead, we constrain the doublet ratio to D2/D1
≥ 1.0, we can also obtain a reasonable ﬁt, though this in-
troduces noticeable discrepancies in the reddest part of the
feature — see the middle panel of Figure 9. In addition, this
forces the doublet ratio of the bluer doublet outside of the
range of normal values: D2/D1 ≈ 2.5. Adding more compo-
nents to our model ﬁt will not solve this quandary (though
the data do show a shoulder on the bluer doublet, suggest-
ing a third absorption component). The implications for the
Na I gas (and the dust) in NGC 2388 are not clear.

Given the spectral signatures of dense CSM surround-
ing SN 2015U, it is natural to wonder whether some of the
Na D absorption arises within the local CSM. Variation in
the Na D features over the timescale of the SN evolution
would be a clear signature of local absorption; however, as
Figure 6 shows, no such variation is apparent.

The bottom panel of Figure 9 displays a cutout of the
two-dimensional (2D) DEIMOS spectrum around the Na D
feature. Both SN 2015U and NGC 2388 are clearly visi-
ble, and we also show the rotation curve of the galaxy via
a cutout of the Hα emission line. The Na D absorption of
NGC 2388’s own ISM is seen against the stellar light of the
galaxy, and this galactic self-absorption roughly covers the
velocity range observed between the two components ob-
served along the line of sight toward SN 2015U. It appears
that the anomalous red component described above obscures
the host galaxy as well as the SN, providing further evidence
that this component is unlikely to arise within the CSM of
SN 2015U.

3.2.4 Spectropolarimetry

We did not observe signiﬁcant evolution in the polarization
of SN 2015U between our three epochs, so we coadded all of
the data to increase the SNR; the results are illustrated in
Figure 10. The polarization spectrum of SN 2015U appears
to be dominated by ISP associated with the host galaxy
NGC 2388, showing a strong increase in continuum polar-
ization toward shorter wavelengths with a value of P ≈ 2.5%
at 4600 ˚A and decreasing to P ≈ 1.0% near 7000 ˚A. This be-
haviour is dissimilar to what is typically observed for the
MW ISP, which exhibits a peak and turnover near 5500 ˚A.
Instead, the observed behaviour is reminiscent of the ISP
produced by the host galaxies of several SNe Ia, including
SNe 1986G, 2006X, 2008fp, and 2014J (Patat et al. 2015, see

U photometric passbands has previously been interpreted
as evidence for scattering by dust grains smaller than those
characteristic of the MW disk ISM.

Interestingly, we observe a signiﬁcant wavelength de-
pendence for the position angle (θ), which has a value of
∼ 25◦ at 4600 ˚A and monotonically trends toward ∼ 10◦ near
7000 ˚A. In the MW, the ISP’s position angle is generally ﬂat.
However, a wavelength dependence in θ has been observed
along particular lines of sight toward star-forming regions
at distances greater than 0.6 kpc (e.g., Gehrels & Silvester
1965; Coyne & Gehrels 1966), and has been explained as
the result of photons traversing multiple clouds or scattering
media that exhibit various sizes for the scattering particles
as well as various orientations for the interstellar magnetic
ﬁeld.

A similar interpretation is plausible here: along the
line of sight within NGC 2388 toward SN 2015U there are
likely to be multiple separate components of dusty scat-
tering media having diﬀerent grain sizes and/or diﬀerent
magnetic ﬁeld orientations. This possibility is particularly
interesting considering the complex superposition of mul-
tiple Na I D absorption doublets that we see in our high-
resolution DEIMOS spectrum. If the continuum ﬂux spec-
trum of SN 2015U is devoid of broad SN features because
of high optical-depth CSM, then one might suspect there
also to be a separate and distinct scattering component as-
sociated with this CSM, if it is dusty. The subsequent re-
scattering of this light as it traverses the dusty ISM of the
host could provide a means for producing the observed wave-
length dependence of θ, if there is a diﬀerence in grain sizes
between these multiple scattering media. Although this sce-
nario is physically plausible, the spectropolarimetric data
cannot discriminate between a CSM+ISM scattering combi-
nation and multiple components of host ISM, and our anal-
ysis of the total-ﬂux Na I D features indicates that they are
likely associated with ISM (see §3.2.3).

Finally, there is a line-like feature near 5820 ˚A which
might naively be interpreted as a signature of intrinsic po-
larization associated with SN 2015U and with the He I /
Na I transition. However, the MW Na I D doublet falls at
the same wavelength. Although relatively weak compared
to the redshifted host-galaxy Na D absorption, the results of
our spectral arithmetic in the vicinity of this poorly resolved
doublet proﬁle might have created a spurious artifact in the
ﬁnal coadded dataset mimicking the shape of a polarized
line feature. Indeed, in each individual epoch, the polarized
spectra near this feature appear to suﬀer from systematic
noise, so we are reluctant to attribute this feature to the SN
itself.

3.3 Photometry

The optical light curves of SN 2015U show that it was a re-
markably luminous and rapidly evolving event — Figure 11
shows our photometry corrected for host-galaxy dust red-
dening. With a peak absolute magnitude of (cid:46) −19 mag at
optical wavelengths, a rise time of (cid:46) 10 d, a time above
half-maximum of t1/2 ≈ 12 d, and a decline rate of nearly
0.2 mag day−1 after peak, SN 2015U was more than a magni-
tude brighter than most stripped-envelope SNe and evolved

much more rapidly (e.g., Drout et al. 2011; Bianco et al.
2014).

Though the ﬁrst unﬁltered (clear) KAIT detection of
SN 2015U was on Feb. 11, and it went undetected by KAIT
on Feb. 10 (> 18.37 mag), Pastorello et al. (2015) present
detections from Feb. 9 and 10 at R = 18.62± 0.26 and 18.14±
0.30 mag, respectively. Unfortunately, the location does not
appear to have been observed in the days prior and there
are not deep upper limits constraining the explosion date
further. SN 2015U rose quite rapidly, so we adopt a tentative
explosion date one day before the ﬁrst detection published
by Pastorello et al. (2015): texp ≈ 57062 MJD (Feb. 8). This
provides us with a rise time for SN 2015U of trise ≈ 9 days.
Tsvetkov et al. (2015) note that SN 2015U is among the
most rapidly evolving SNe known, with a decline rate similar
to those of SNe 2002bj, 2005ek, and 2010X. We measure
∆M15 ≈ 2.0 mag in the R band, but note that the decline rate
increases ever more steeply after ∼ 10 days post-peak and
at all times the bluer passbands decline more rapidly than
the red. Simple linear ﬁts indicate the following decline rates
before and after +10 d (in mag day−1): Bearly = 0.110 ± 0.007,
Vearly = 0.099 ± 0.005, Vlate = 0.28 ± 0.07, Rearly = 0.080 ± 0.005,
Rlate = 0.267± 0.009, Iearly = 0.067± 0.006, and Ilate = 0.26± 0.04
(uncertainties are statistical, and our data do not constrain
the late B-band decline).

SN 2015U with those in the R band.

3.4 Comparisons with Other Supernovae

In Figure 12 we compare the light curves of SN 2015U
to the R-band light curves of SN 2002bj (Poznanski et al.
2010), which was very similar though ∼ 1 mag fainter,
and SN 2010X (Kasliwal et al. 2010), which also matches
well but was another ∼ 1.5 mag fainter. SNLS04D4ec and
SNLS06D1hc, two of the rapidly rising transients discov-
ered by the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and presented
by Arcavi et al. (2015), also show similar light-curve be-
haviour but ∼ 0.5 mag brighter than SN 2015U (see their Fig-
ure 2). In Figure 13 we compare the spectra of these events:
SN 2002bj was hydrogen deﬁcient (SN IIb-like, though not a
good spectroscopic match to normal SNe IIb) with a strong
blue continuum and P-Cygni features at higher velocities
than observed in SN 2015U, while SN 2010X showed no
hydrogen (SN Ib/c-like, though again not a good spectro-
scopic match to normal SNe Ib/c) with broad absorption
features. (Unfortunately, no spectra were obtained of the
SNLS events.)

The light curves and spectra of SN 2015U are also quite
similar to those of the rapidly evolving and luminous tran-
sients discovered in the PS1 dataset and presented by Drout
et al. (2014). Figure 11 includes the g and i-band light curves
of the relatively well-observed PS1-12bv from that sample;
it was discovered at z = 0.405, so the g and i passbands
probe rest wavelengths around 3500 ˚A (about 100 ˚A short-
ward of B) and 5350 ˚A (similar to V), respectively. Without
the 0.5 mag oﬀset used in Figure 11, the i-band light curve
of PS1-12bv would overlie the V band of SN 2015U almost
exactly, and the g-band curve would be somewhat brighter
than the B band of SN 2015U. There are no clear detections
of any emission features in the spectrum of PS1-12bv, but it
and the other events from the PS1 sample were discovered

at very large distances, and high-SNR spectra do not exist
for those events. It is plausible that narrow emission lines
of helium (and/or hydrogen) were present but went unde-
tected.

Figure 13 shows that SN 2015U shares the blue colour
and prominent He I emission features of the canonical
SN Ibn 2006jc (e.g., Foley et al. 2007; Pastorello et al. 2008).
However, SN 2006jc was discovered post-peak and evolved
more slowly than SN 2015U: the earliest extant spectrum
of SN 2006jc was taken after the event had faded ∼ 1 mag
from peak and the spectrum had already transitioned into a
nearly nebular phase, though a blue pseudocontinuum was
apparent due to ongoing interaction with the CSM (Foley
et al. 2007). In contrast, SN 2015U presented a continuum-
dominated spectrum through our last epoch of spectroscopy,
also taken after the event had faded ∼ 1 mag from peak.
Unlike SN 2015U, the light curve of SN 2006jc showed
a tail out to 60+ days (fading somewhat faster than the
0.0098 mag day−1 expected from fully trapped 56Co decay;
Foley et al. 2007).

The early-time spectrum of SN 2015U is similar to the
very early spectra of SN IIn 1998S, excepting the absence of
hydrogen in the former. Both events show a smooth, blue,
and (approximately) blackbody continuum. The He I lines
of SN 2015U are stronger than those of SN 1998S, and the
implied CSM velocity of SN 2015U is signiﬁcantly higher,
but the N III/C III complex near 4500 ˚A is clearly detected
in both. This feature dominates at very early times but dis-
appears by peak (though that evolution took place over dif-
ferent timescales for these two SNe).
The ∼ 20-day timescale for SN 2015U’s evolution and
the increasing decline rate are reminiscent of the light curves
expected for low-56Ni explosions in helium-dominated or

oxygen-dominated envelopes — see, for example, the mod-
els of Dessart et al. (2011) and Kleiser & Kasen (2014). In
these models, the recombination of helium or oxygen pro-
duces a dramatic and rapid drop in opacity within the ejecta
and an inward-moving recombination front. SN 2015U was
much more luminous than these models, but perhaps it was
an analogous event wherein a recombination wave in the
extended CSM produced a rapid fade from maximum lu-
minosity as the CSM cools after shock breakout. Similar
situations have been observed in hydrogen-rich SNe: there
exists a subclass of SNe IIn that shows light curves with a
plateau likely produced via hydrogen recombination within
their extended CSM (SNe 1994W, 2009kn, and 2011ht; e.g.,
Mauerhan et al. 2013).

The narrow P-Cygni proﬁles and strong continuua of
SN 2015U’s spectra are clear indications of dense CSM. The
diversity of ways in which such CSM can aﬀect the light
curves of SNe have been explored in detail by several au-
thors motivated by observations of SNe IIn/Ibn, superlumi-
nous SNe, and rapidly fading SNe (e.g., Ofek et al. 2010;
Chevalier & Irwin 2011; Kleiser & Kasen 2014), and com-
parisons of SN 2015U’s light curve to these models implies
that SN 2015U was a shock-breakout event. The high lu-
minosity indicates that shock breakout occurred at a large
radius and that a signiﬁcant fraction of the SN’s kinetic en-
ergy was converted into light, while the lack of a long-lasting
light-curve tail shows that the CSM surrounding SN 2015U
was more shell-like than wind-like (there is no interaction-
powered tail) and that relatively little 56Ni was produced
(there is no radioactively powered tail).

The rapidly fading light curves of SNe 2002bj and
2010X are remarkably similar to those of SN 2015U, and
we argue that their spectral diﬀerences do not exclude the
possibility that these three events were fundamentally quite
similar. By varying the radius of a putative opaque CSM

MNRAS 000, 1–18 (2016)

shell in a simple model, we can understand events spanning
a range of luminosities and timespans for which the opaque
CSM reprocesses the SN ﬂux. Under the assumption that
their light curves are all shock cooling curves without signiﬁ-
cant contribution from radioactive nickel, the peak luminosi-
ties and timescales of these three SNe should be governed
roughly by
tSN ∝ E−1/6M1/2R1/6κ1/6T−2/3 ,
LSN ∝ E5/6M−1/2R2/3κ−1/3T 4/3 ,
following Kleiser & Kasen (2014), adapted from Kasen &
Woosley (2009) for hydrogen-free SNe and based on the an-
alytic framework of Popov (1993). E is the energy of the SN
explosion, M is the mass ejected, and R is the eﬀective radius
(in this case, the radius reached by a signiﬁcant amount of
mass ejected prior to the ﬁnal explosion).

In particular, consider the peak-luminosity equation, as-
suming these explosions are similar in all their properties ex-
cept for the eﬀective pre-SN radius R, which would be deter-
mined by the time before explosion and the speed at which
any pre-SN material was ejected. Inverting the equation, the
pre-SN R ∝ L3/2
SN . If we assume that the ejecta velocities of
all three objects are similar, this means that the ejecta from
the SN itself will pass through the surrounding CSM in a
time tinteract ∝ R, and the length of time after explosion we
expect to see narrow lines from this interaction is propor-
tional to R. Comparing the relative peak luminosities, we
ﬁnd that, since SN 2015U exhibited narrow lines at least up
to ∼ 16.5 days after explosion, SN 2002bj should have shown
narrow lines at least until ∼ 5.5 days after explosion and
the even dimmer SN 2010X would have shown narrow lines
at least until ∼ 0.52 days. These times are well before the
ﬁrst spectra were taken of either SN 2002bj or SN 2010X.
Typically, we expect that to discover narrow lines in these

rapidly fading SNe, we will either need to look at the bright-
est among them or catch them very early. The luminosity
(and timescale) may also depend on the explosion energies,
ejected masses, and other properties of the SN, but these
must be disentangled with more sophisticated numerical ap-
proaches.

3.5 Temperature and Luminosity Evolution

The extreme and uncertain degree of host-galaxy dust red-
dening toward SN 2015U makes estimating bolometric prop-
erties quite diﬃcult. In §3.1 we assume that the emission
from SN 2015U is roughly blackbody in spectral shape; here
we further discuss this assumption. It has long been known
that the continua of young SNe II exhibit “diluted black-
body” spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which (at op-
tical wavelengths) are similar to the Planck function at a
lower temperature (e.g., Hershkowitz et al. 1986; Eastman
et al. 1996). Though SN 2015U is certainly not a SN II, it is
continuum-dominated, and in the sections above we present
evidence that SN 2015U was shrouded in an optically thick
CSM. In addition, Moriya et al. (2011) show that mod-
eled shock breakouts from the hydrogen-dominated CSM
around red supergiants exhibit roughly blackbody SEDs.
Rabinak & Waxman (2011) explore shock breakouts from He
or He/CO stellar envelopes in detail; for He-dominated stel-
lar envelopes, they show that the colour temperature of the
system deviates from the photosphere’s temperature by a
(time-dependent) factor of only ∼ 20%, largely owing to dif-
fusion eﬀects as a helium recombination wave moves through
the material.

Given the above discussion, we assume that SN 2015U’s
emission was roughly blackbody and we estimate the bolo-
metric properties by ﬁtting a dust-reddened Planck spec-
trum to our multiband photometry. Using our almost nightly
observations of SN 2015U in the BVRI passbands, we assem-
bled the observed optical SEDs from −5 d to +20 d and ﬁnd
the best-ﬁt blackbody temperature, radius, and luminosity
using MCMC maximum-likelihood methods. As described
in §3.1, there are large uncertainties in the properties of the
host galaxy’s dust, and these uncertainties produce simi-
larly large uncertainties in the absolute value of the temper-
ature at any given time. In addition, our optical photometry
largely probes the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of SN 2015U’s SED,
so the implied bolometric corrections are large and uncer-
tain. Our MCMC-produced error bars include these eﬀects,
and our photometric data do indicate signiﬁcant tempera-
ture evolution (assuming E(B − V) and RV do not change).
Because our data constrain the evolution of SN 2015U more
strongly than they constrain the absolute values of any given
parameter, it is useful to consider the implications for a few
assumed values of E(B − V).

Figure 14 shows the blackbody temperature, bolomet-
ric luminosity, and radius evolution of SN 2015U for three
diﬀerent assumed values of E(B−V), adopting RV = 2.1. In all
cases, the best-ﬁt temperature decreases over time, with the
temperature falling rapidly before (optical) peak and then
decreasing slowly thereafter. The eﬀective blackbody radius
increases with a photospheric velocity of vphot ≈ 15, 000 km s−1
until peak, leveling oﬀ thereafter. Though this value of vphot
is similar to the characteristic velocities of ejecta in stripped-
envelope SNe, our spectra do not show any material moving

is our preferred value, but the degree of dust reddening
produced by the ISM of NGC 2388 is very uncertain (see
§3.1). This uncertainty is the dominant source of error in this
analysis, and the spread over these three values of E(B − V)
indicates the range. All values are estimated through simple

polynomial ﬁts to the curves shown in Figure 14. To

coverage), and for the other parameters we show the value at

before the optical maximum; again, see Figure 14.

that quickly and, given our interpretation of SN 2015U as
a cooling shock-breakout event, we expect the photospheric
radius to be approximately constant throughout these ob-
servations. In addition, Figure 14 may surprise the reader
by indicating that the peak bolometric luminosity occurred
several days before the optical peak. These results indicate
that our pre-maximum temperatures are perhaps overesti-
mated (the bolometric corrections are at their largest and
most uncertain at early times). Unfortunately, we do not
know of any observations constraining the ultraviolet emis-
sion of SN 2015U.

However, we can constrain the temperature evolution of
SN 2015U independently of the continuum shape, through
the relative line strengths of detected emission lines in our
spectra. Though detailed modeling is beyond the scope of
this paper, the pre-maximum detection and rapid fading
of the N III/C III/He II 4500 ˚A complex in our spectra of
SN 2015U brings to mind the spectral evolution of SN 1998S
(see Figure 13). Detailed CMFGEN models of SN 1998S
while the 4500 ˚A feature was strong were presented by Shiv-
vers et al. (2015), indicating a temperature of ∼30,000 K
throughout most of the line-forming region. The agree-
ment between this value and the pre-maximum temperatures
found for SN 2015U assuming E(B−V) = 0.94 mag are heart-
ening. In Table 3 we present the integrated energy released
and various values at V-band peak.

3.6 Nickel Content

A 56Ni-powered tail has been detected in some SNe Ibn, but
many members of this subclass (including SN 2015U) do not
show one (e.g., Foley et al. 2007; Gorbikov et al. 2014; Pa-
storello et al. 2016). For most SNe I, Arnett’s law can be
used to estimate the total 56Ni synthesized by the explosion
(Arnett 1982). That approach is not applicable for shock-
breakout events (or events powered by ongoing CSM inter-
action), and so we only place an upper limit on the amount
of 56Ni present in SN 2015U based upon our nondetection
of a radioactive tail. We use the method of Hamuy (2003):
given a luminosity Lt at time t and an explosion time t0, and

Our most constraining observation of this tail is a non-
detection in the R band at +36 days. Our last multiband
photometric measurement of the temperature yields T =
6000 ± 1000 K at +18 d (see §3.5). We adopt that tempera-
ture to calculate the blackbody luminosity for a source at our
nondetection threshold, but we note that the temperature
is still changing at this time, possibly aﬀecting our results.
This calculation yields an upper limit of MNi (cid:46) 0.019 M(cid:12) —
quite low for SNe I (MNi,Ia (cid:38) 0.4 M(cid:12), MNi,Ib/c ≈ 0.2 M(cid:12); Con-
tardo et al. 2000; Drout et al. 2011), but within the range of
values observed for SNe II (MNi,II ≈ 0.0016–0.26 M(cid:12); Hamuy
2003).

3.7 Progenitor Mass-Loss Rate

We adopt the simple shock-wind interaction model of Cheva-
lier & Irwin (2011) to estimate the properties of the CSM
surrounding SN 2015U. We assume that the CSM is spheri-
cally symmetric and follows a wind-like density proﬁle (ρ ∝
r−2), and we use the opacity of helium-dominated material in
our calculations (κ = 0.2 cm2 g−1). Margutti et al. (2014) solve
the Chevalier & Irwin (2011) model in terms of three observ-
ables: break-out radius Rbo (the radius at which radiation
diﬀuses forward ahead of the shock), total radiated energy
Erad, and light-curve rise time trise. We use trise = 9 days and,
assuming E(B−V)host = 0.94 mag, we adopt Erad = 7.1×1049 erg

MNRAS 000, 1–18 (2016)

˙M ∝ R−3

from Table 3. For Rbo we adopt the ﬁrst measured blackbody
radius from Figure 14: Rbo = 5×1014 cm. The resultant mass-
˙M ≈ 1.2 M(cid:12) yr−1. However, in
loss estimate is very large,
this model
bo , and there is reason to believe that our
measurement of the blackbody radius before peak bright-
ness does not reﬂect the true Rbo (see §3.5). If we instead
use Rbo = 9 × 1014 cm, the blackbody radius at V-band peak,
we calculate ˙M ≈ 0.2 M(cid:12) yr−1.

Both of these values are several orders of magni-
tude above the most extreme mass-loss rates produced by
steady winds from stars, but they are not far from the
time-averaged eruptive mass-loss rates from luminous blue
variables (LBVs, which may well exhibit much higher in-
stantaneous mass-loss rates; Smith 2014). Observations of
iPTF13beo, a recent SN Ibn discovered by the intermediate
Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), implied an even higher
˙M ≈ 2.4 M(cid:12) yr−1 imme-
(but short-lived) mass-loss rate of
diately before the progenitor underwent core collapse (esti-
mated via similar methods; Gorbikov et al. 2014).

If the CSM around SN 2015U was launched from the
surface explosively rather than through a steady wind, the
assumption that ρcsm ∝ r−2 is suspect. In fact, the lack of an
interaction-powered tail in the light curve of SN 2015U in-
dicates that the density proﬁle cannot be wind-like: Cheva-
lier & Irwin (2011) show that ongoing interaction with a
wind-like CSM powers a tail with L ∝ t−0.6, and SN 2015U
fades more rapidly than that throughout its post-peak evo-
lution. The lack of any high-velocity features in our spectra
argues that this outer CSM must be optically thick at least
out to the radius of the shock at the time of our last spec-

trum. Assuming vshock ≈ 20, 000 km s−1, the velocity of the
fastest material in unshrouded stripped-envelope SNe, this
produces an estimate for the CSM extent of R (cid:38) 3× 1015 cm.
Adopting the average He I velocity measured from our spec-
tra (745 km s−1), material at that radius was launched 1–2 yr
before core collapse. However, it is likely that the SN ejecta
is slowed by its collision with the CSM, and so it may be
more physically relevant to assume the CSM extent to be
R (cid:38) 9 × 1014 cm (the blackbody radius at V-band peak); ma-
terial at that radius was launched < 1 yr before collapse.

It is not clear whether the extreme mass loss from
SN 2015U’s progenitor was episodic and brief or sustained
over a year or more, nor is it known whether the assump-
tion of spherical symmetry is appropriate. We leave a more
thorough examination of these questions to future work.

3.8 Constraints on Progenitor Variability

The presence of dense CSM suggests a recent history of ex-
treme mass loss and perhaps variability of the progenitor
star. SN Ibn 2006jc, for example, underwent a bright out-
burst (M = −14 mag) about 2 yr before becoming a genuine
SN (Nakano et al. 2006; Foley et al. 2007; Pastorello et al.
2007), and there are multiple cases where the progenitors of
SNe IIn have been detected in outburst in the years prior to
core collapse (e.g., Ofek et al. 2014). KAIT has been moni-
toring NGC 2388 for almost 20 yr and we searched this ex-
tensive dataset for evidence of pre-explosion variability. We
augment our unﬁltered KAIT data with the publicly avail-
able PTF images of the ﬁeld in the r passband.9

Examining 758 images with observed upper limits
fainter than 17.0 mag from 1998 Oct. through 2015 Feb. 10,
we ﬁnd no evidence for previous outbursts of the progeni-
tor based upon diﬀerence imaging (using one of our deep-
est single exposures for a template). We stacked our images
into rolling-window time bins 20 d wide and subtracted tem-
plates to search for evidence of previous outbursts of that
timescale, but found none. We also stacked all images to-
gether and searched for evidence of a progenitor, but found
none. (Note that we stacked the KAIT and PTF images sep-
arately, and we did not perform diﬀerence imaging on these
very deep stacks, as we had no templates with which to com-
pare.) Figure 15 plots our 1σ single-image nondetections and
the observed light curve of SN 2015U.

Though we have regular imaging of NGC 2388 most
years since 1998, the ﬁeld was inaccessible to our telescopes
for several months every year, so there are signiﬁcant gaps,
especially compared to the timescale of SN 2015U’s light
curve (∼ 20 d). The orange bars along the bottom of Fig-
ure 15 mark every night at which more than 20 days had
passed since the previous upper limit, indicating timespans
when a previous SN 2015U-like event could have occurred
undetected.

Unfortunately, even the epochs that were covered by
our monitoring campaigns do not yield stringent constraints
on the luminosity of a previous outburst, partially owing to
the estimated ∼ 1.5 mag of host-galaxy dust extinction along
the line of sight toward SN 2015U. The detected outburst
of SN 2006jc’s precursor reached a peak of Mr ≈ −14.1 mag

been obtained for at least 20 days are marked in orange along the
bottom.

(Pastorello et al. 2007), and such an outburst in SN 2015U’s
precursor would have probably remained undetected by our
monitoring campaign.

4 CONCLUSION

low-velocity, rapidly evolving,

In this paper we presented observations of SN 2015U, a
highly extinguished,
lumi-
nous, apparently hydrogen-free SN which exploded in the
strongly star-forming galaxy NGC 2388. Though detailed
modeling has yet to be performed, and the degree of host-
galaxy dust interference is uncertain, our observations in-
dicate that SN 2015U was a core-collapse SN with a peak
powered by shock breakout from a dense CSM rather than
radioactive decay. We suggest that this CSM was not wind-
like but was instead created by at least one extreme episode
of mass loss ( ˙M ≈ 0.2–1.2 M(cid:12) yr−1) within a few years of
core collapse. The CSM that surrounded SN 2015U was ef-
fectively hydrogen-free but was helium-rich; we also detect
features from nitrogen, iron, and probably carbon in our
spectra. No long-lasting light-curve tail was observed from
radioactivity or from ongoing CSM interaction, thereby con-
straining the amount of 56Ni that could have been produced
in SN 2015U to (cid:46) 0.019 M(cid:12).

SN 2015U is a remarkably well-observed SN Ibn, es-
pecially among the rapidly fading subset of these events,
and we ﬁnd many similarities between it and other SNe in
the literature. Modern surveys indicate the existence of a
class of blue, continuum-dominated, hydrogen-deﬁcient, lu-
minous, and rapidly evolving SNe including those found by
Drout et al. (2014) and Arcavi et al. (2015); our analysis
of SN 2015U implies fundamental similarities between these
events, a subset of the SNe Ibn (e.g., Pastorello et al. 2016),
and other rapidly fading SNe of lower luminosity (i.e., SNe
2002bj and 2010X). While the exact progenitors of these
events are quite uncertain, it is clear that they demand ex-
treme mass-loss rates from their stripped-envelope progeni-
tor stars.
