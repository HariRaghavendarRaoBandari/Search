Trapped ions are a promising tool for building a large-scale quantum computer. The number of
required radiation ﬁelds for the realisation of quantum gates in any proposed ion-based architecture
scales with the number of ions inside the quantum computer, posing a major challenge when imag-
ining a device with millions of qubits. Here we present a fundamentally diﬀerent approach, where
this scaling entirely vanishes. The method is based on individually controlled voltages applied to
each logic gate location to facilitate the actual gate operation analogous to a traditional transistor
architecture within a classical computer processor. We demonstrate the key principle of this ap-
proach by implementing a versatile quantum gate method based on long-wavelength radiation where
we generate a maximally entangled two-qubit state with ﬁdelity 0.985(12). This quantum gate also
constitutes a simple-to-implement tool for quantum metrology, sensing and simulation.

The control of the internal and external degrees of free-
dom of trapped ions using laser light has allowed unprece-
dented advances in the creation of multi-particle entan-
gled states [1], quantum simulation [2, 3], frequency stan-
dards [4] and scalable quantum logic [5, 6]. A major goal
is now to construct a large-scale quantum computer by
scaling current systems up to a signiﬁcantly larger num-
ber of ions. The circuit-model approach for quantum in-
formation processing requires the realization of arbitrary
single qubit gates and a two-qubit entanglement opera-
tion [7]. The use of laser light for the implementation of
these quantum logic operations has been extremely suc-
cessful, with gate ﬁdelities in the fault-tolerant regime
having been achieved for single [8] as well as two-qubit
gates [9].

Despite these successes, developing alternative ap-
proaches to using laser light is desirable due to the signiﬁ-
cant technological challenges which arise with an increas-
ing number of qubits. This becomes particularly obvious
when considering that a useful quantum computer may
require millions of ions which would need thousands of
laser beams to be carefully aligned to micrometer preci-
sion. Long-wavelength radiation in the microwave and
radio-frequency (RF) domain is comparably simple to
generate, highly stable and is naturally broadcast over
a large area using a small number of standard oﬀ-the-
shelf emitters, essentially removing these alignment re-
quirements. Microwave ﬁelds have already been used to
implement single qubit gates with errors of only 10−6, far
surpassing fault-tolerant thresholds [10]. Free-running
long-wavelength radiation on its own is however not suf-
ﬁcient for the implementation of multi-qubit gates, as it
only weakly drives the ions’ motion due to the vanishingly
small Lamb-Dicke parameter. This drawback was ﬁrst
addressed in the seminal work by Mintert and Wunder-
lich in 2001 who showed that combining a static magnetic
ﬁeld gradient with externally applied long-wavelength ra-
diation creates a sizable eﬀective Lamb-Dicke parameter

[11]. More recently, Ospelkaus et al. proposed using
the oscillating magnetic ﬁeld gradients experienced by
an ion trapped in the near-ﬁeld of a microwave waveg-
uide to perform multi-qubit gates [12]. This scheme was
subsequently used to perform the ﬁrst microwave-based
two-qubit gate by Ospelkaus et al.
[13]. This scheme
requires ions to be trapped close to a surface incorpo-
rating the microwave waveguide and therefore the eﬀects
of motional heating must be considered. When scaling
this approach, especially considering complicated elec-
trode geometries such as X-junctions, relevant individual
microwave impedance matching for each entanglement
zone across the whole architecture must be assured. Ad-
dressing of individual ions would typically require the use
of destructive interference incorporating all microwave
ﬁelds applied within the range of the ion or other sophis-
ticated methods [14, 15].

The approach using a static magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ent in conjunction with externally applied global long-
wavelength radiation is not subject to the above con-
straints and has also been used to implement a two-qubit
gate between nearest as well as non-nearest neighbour
ions.
In stark contrast to the work presented in this
manuscript, the ﬁrst demonstration of this method was
implemented making use of an ‘undriven’ magnetic gra-
dient induced coupling [16]. However, in this scheme,
the dominant source of noise is ambient magnetic ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations as naturally occurring states with diﬀerent
magnetic moments must be used, ruling out the use of
a so-called clock qubit [16]. This made it appear that
fault-tolerant multi-qubit gate operations and the subse-
quent use in a long-wavelength-radiation-based ion trap
quantum computer may be more challenging.

In this work we remove this remaining challenge by
quantum engineering an eﬀective clock qubit making use
of ‘dressed states’ [17–19]. We follow the seminal pro-
posal by Timoney et al.
[17] to use such states to im-
plement a Mølmer-Sørensen two-qubit gate [20] utilizing

long-wavelength radiation and a static magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dient. By demonstrating entanglement using quantum-
engineered clock qubits we negate the requirement of us-
ing naturally occurring highly noise-sensitive qubit states
which so far had to be used, thereby opening up the pos-
sibility for fault-tolerant quantum operations to be imple-
mented. We then outline a remarkably simple approach
which utilizes this gate technology to scale to an, in prin-
ciple, arbitrarily large number of fault-tolerant two-qubit
gate operations in parallel where the number of required
ﬁelds is no longer correlated with the number of pairs
being entangled. This provides a simple and powerful
architecture which forms the core element within a wider
industrial blueprint to build a large-scale microwave ion
trap quantum computer [21].

The two-qubit gate is performed on two 171Yb+ ions
in a Paul trap with an ion-electrode distance of 310 µm
[22]. We place permanent magnets close to the ion trap
with an ion-to-nearest-magnet distance of approximately
6 mm as shown in Fig. 1. This provides a static magnetic
ﬁeld gradient of 23.6(3) T/m which is approximately con-
stant across the ion string [23]. We slightly displace
the ions from the magnetic ﬁeld nil, which lifts the de-
generacy of the 2S1/2 F=1 manifolds by 12.0 MHz and
14.8 MHz for ions 1 and 2 respectively, and deﬁnes the
internal-state quantisation axis to lie along the trap axis.
Laser light near-resonant with the 2S1/2 ↔ 2P1/2 transi-
tion is used for Doppler laser cooling and for initial state
preparation as well as state detection. State-dependent

ﬂuorescence is collected on a photo-multiplier tube, and
the ﬂuorescence measurements are normalised to remove
preparation and detection errors (supplementary text).

To broadcast the required long-wavelength radiation
we only require a standard oﬀ-the-shelf microwave horn
and a 3-turn rf-emitting copper coil placed outside the
ultra-high vacuum environment, thereby providing an ex-
tremely straightforward approach to scaling this scheme
to many more ions. We note that in a large-scale archi-
tecture our approach utilizes submerged static currents
to be applied to microfabricated chip traps to give rise
to the required static magnetic ﬁeld gradients. The ion-
surface distance requirement in this case is not very strin-
gent. Simulations show magnetic ﬁeld gradients in excess
of 150 T/m with an ion-electrode distance of approxi-
mately 150 µm can be achieved, using realistic values of
applied current that have already been applied to an ion
trapping chip of this type [21]. Such a relatively large ion-
electrode distance minimizes decoherence due to charge
ﬂuctuations from the electrode surface.

Instead of using a naturally occurring magnetic ﬁeld
sensitive qubit we quantum engineer a highly noise-
resilient ‘clock-like’ qubit by ﬁrst addressing each ion
with a pair of microwave ﬁelds coupling the 2S1/2, F =
0 ≡ |0(cid:105) with the 2S1/2, F = 1, mF = +1 ≡ |+1(cid:105) and
2S1/2, F = 1, mF = −1 ≡ |−1(cid:105) (Fig. 1). In the appropri-
√
ate interaction picture this results in three dressed-states,
including the well-protected state |↑(cid:105) = (|+1(cid:105)−|−1(cid:105))/

to our qubit has been investigated in detail theoretically
[17, 26] and forms the basis of our experimental imple-
mentation. We implement the gate on the axial stretch
3νz = 2π × 459.34(1)
mode with a frequency of νs =
kHz, where νz is the axial centre-of-mass mode fre-
quency, giving an eﬀective Lamb-Dicke parameter [11]
ηeﬀ = z0µB∂zB/
This mode is sideband cooled to ¯n = 0.14(3) using a vari-
ant of the scheme described in ref.
[27] (supplementary
text) before the internal states are prepared in the state
|↓↓(cid:105). A pair of RF ﬁelds is then applied to each ion with
frequencies close to the red and blue sidebands (carrier
Rabi frequency Ω0 = 2π×45.4 kHz). The frequencies are
set to be symmetric about the carrier frequency, corre-
sponding to detunings ±νs±δ. The gate detuning δ is set
to δ = 2ηeﬀΩ0 = 2π × 370 Hz in order that at time tg =
√
2π/δ = 2.7 ms, the ions are ideally prepared in a maxi-
mally entangled spin state |Ψφ0(cid:105) = (|↑↑(cid:105) + eiφ0 |↓↓(cid:105))/
2
(supplementary text). Fig. 2 (A) shows the evolution of
the spin state populations as a function of time. To mea-
sure the coherence of the entangled state, a carrier π/2
pulse is applied to each ion after the gate pulse. Fig. 2
(B) shows the parity Π = P (↑↑) + P (↓↓)− P (↑↓)− P (↓↑)
as a function of the phase φ of the π/2 pulse (supplemen-
tary text). The amplitude of the parity oscillation (A)
along with the populations at tg allows the ﬁdelity of the
obtained density matrix ˆρ with respect to the ideal out-
come |Ψφ0(cid:105) to be calculated using F = (cid:104)Ψφ0| ˆρ|Ψφ0(cid:105) =
[P (↑↑) + P (↓↓)]/2 + A/2 [24]. We measure the popula-
tions at tg to be P (↑↑) + P (↓↓) = 0.997(8) and a ﬁt to
the parity scan shown in Fig. 2 (B) gives an amplitude of
A = 0.972(17). From this we extract a Bell state ﬁdelity
of F = 0.985(12).

The most signiﬁcant contributions to the inﬁdelity
stem from heating of the vibrational mode of motion
(1×10−2) used during the gate operation and depolarisa-
tion of the qubit (3× 10−3). Both sources of error can be
signiﬁcantly reduced by increasing the gate speed using
a larger static magnetic ﬁeld gradient and by increasing
Ω0. The depolarisation error can be further reduced by
improving our microwave setup as a result of which a co-
herence time of seconds should be achievable as already
demonstrated by Baumgart et al. [28]. Additional small
sources of inﬁdelity are discussed in the supplementary
text.

Achieving gate ﬁdelities that would enable fault-
tolerant operation using long-wavelength radiation can
be realized either by the use of ion trap microchips or
by a slight modiﬁcation of our setup. By reducing the
ion-to-nearest-magnet distance in a modiﬁed trap design
to 2.4 mm, a magnetic ﬁeld gradient of 150 T/m would
result. This gives a large increase of the motional cou-
pling strength, enabling a signiﬁcant reduction of the er-
ror terms. Following a full numerical simulation of the
system, a ﬁdelity far in the fault-tolerant regime would
result using already demonstrated parameters (supple-

quantum-engineered clock qubit {|↓(cid:105) , |↓(cid:105)} (supplemen-
tary text). Unlike a standard clock transition, which has
a ﬁxed energy splitting, the qubit transition frequency
is tunable by using a magnetic-ﬁeld, enabling individual
qubit addressing with global radiation ﬁelds. We prepare
and detect the engineered clock qubit using the method
developed by Randall et al. [25]. Arbitrary single qubit
gates between |↓(cid:105) and |↑(cid:105) are implemented using an RF
ﬁeld resonant with the |↓(cid:105) ↔ |+1(cid:105) transition [19]. The
degeneracy in frequency between this and the |↓(cid:105) ↔ |−1(cid:105)
transition is lifted by the second-order Zeeman shift. Us-
ing a Ramsey type experiment we measure the coherence
time of this qubit to be 650 ms, signiﬁcantly longer than
the ≈ 1 ms coherence time of the bare state qubits that
have so far been used for two-qubit gates with a static
magnetic ﬁeld gradient.

We create a maximally entangled state using a
Mølmer-Sørensen type gate. The application of this gate

ation. In order to select any arbitrary set of gate zones for
single- or two-qubit gate execution, one simply shifts the
position of the ion within these zones axially with respect
to the magnetic ﬁeld gradient by an appropriate amount
using local DC electrodes already used for ion shuttling.
In a magnetic ﬁeld gradient, such shifts in the ion po-
sitions result in a variation of the local oﬀset magnetic
ﬁeld. The energy splitting of the engineered clock-qubit
used in this work can be changed using such oﬀset mag-
netic ﬁelds while remaining protected against magnetic
ﬁeld noise making it resonant or oﬀ-resonant to glob-
ally applied long-wavelength radiation ﬁelds. Therefore,
ions in any arbitrary zone can be tuned into resonance
with a set of globally applied microwave and RF ﬁelds,
providing parallel execution of gates in relevant zones
while all other zones on the chip remain oﬀ-resonant. Al-
ternatively, instead of using displacement of the ions to
change the oﬀset magnetic ﬁeld, an oﬀset magnetic ﬁeld
could also be realized using additional local magnetic
ﬁeld coils located under each gate zone. Microwave horns
and antennas located outside the vacuum system broad-
cast this set of microwave and RF ﬁelds over the entire
microchip or quantum computer architecture. Quantum
operations are then applied in parallel to an arbitrarily
large collection of ions with negligible crosstalk (supple-
mentary text) using a small number of oﬀset magnetic
ﬁelds and associated sets of global microwave and RF
ﬁelds, as shown in Fig. 3. This approach, particularly
when viewed within the context of a blueprint provid-
ing necessary technical details of a realistic device [21]
may provide some foundation for the assertion that the
construction of a practical ion trap quantum computer is
now within reach of current technology.

Scaling current multi-qubit gates to a very large num-
ber of ions for quantum computing while maintaining
fault-tolerant ﬁdelities is a major challenge. The gate
presented here provides a signiﬁcant reduction in exper-
imental complexity, being based on well-developed mi-
crowave and RF technology. Furthermore, in previously
envisioned ion trap quantum computing architectures the
number of radiation ﬁelds required for quantum gate im-
plementation is strongly correlated with the number of
ions used. This constitutes a substantial challenge in the
construction of a large-scale quantum computer, which
may require manipulation of millions or billions of ions.
We have developed an approach that completely removes
this undesirable correlation which we now summarise. In
our approach ions will be located in individual gate zones
that are contained within an array of X-junctions as part
of a microfabricated ion trap architecture [29]. Currents
applied locally to each gate zone create magnetic ﬁeld
gradients of 150 T/m, to be used for entanglement gener-

Atomic structure

As described in the main text, the gate is performed
between two trapped 171Yb+ ions which sit in diﬀerent
magnetic ﬁelds due to a magnetic-ﬁeld gradient. The
Hamiltonian consists of three terms H = Hint + Hext +
Hcouple, where Hint describes the four internal states (|0(cid:105),
|0(cid:48)(cid:105), |−1(cid:105), and |+1(cid:105)) of each atom, Hext describes the
axial stretch mode of the ion pair, and Hcouple describes
the coupling between the internal and external degrees
of freedom due to the ﬁeld gradient.

vidually prepared using both optical pumping to prepare
|00(cid:105), and microwave π pulses, resonant with the desired
clock transition, to prepare |0(cid:48)(cid:105) [25]. We estimate that
each of the states is prepared with inﬁdelity less than
10−3. We measure the ion ﬂuorescence using a photo-
multiplier tube and discriminate between the cases of 0,
1 and 2 ions ﬂuorescing by setting two thresholds. We
record the histograms after preparing each of the four
spin states, allowing us to extract a linear map between
the probabilities P0, P1 and P2 obtained by threshold-
ing, and the spin state probabilities P00, P00(cid:48) + P0(cid:48)0 and
P0(cid:48)0(cid:48). This mapping is then used to normalize data in
subsequent experiments.

Motional coupling due to magnetic-ﬁeld gradient

transitions between internal states to aﬀect the mo-

Sideband cooling

The experimental two-qubit gate sequence is preceded
by a sideband cooling sequence similar to that described
in Ref.
[27], however, here we use a microwave ﬁeld in-

stead of an RF ﬁeld, to drive the red sideband. The ions
are initially Doppler laser cooled for 4 ms using near-
resonant light at 369 nm and prepared in |00(cid:105) after 30 µs
of optical pumping. The sideband cooling sequence then
consists of applying a microwave ﬁeld pulse of frequency
1 − ν, driving the red sideband transition
ωµw = ω0
with a carrier Rabi frequency Ω/2π = 74 kHz. Optical
re-pumping then reinitialises the ions in |00(cid:105). We apply a
total of 500 repetitions of this sideband cooling sequence,
each repetition applying an increasing microwave side-
band pulse time which corresponds to the sideband Rabi
frequencies of diﬀerent populated n levels. Using this
sequence we achieve a ﬁnal temperature of ¯n = 0.14(3).

Qubits formed of the states |+1(cid:105)i, |0(cid:105)i would rapidly

lead to both sources of inﬁdelity and lightshifts of the

As is the case with many other gate implementations,
the eﬀect of oﬀ-resonant carrier excitation is to produce
a rapid oscillation in the gate ﬁdelity. Each carrier tran-
sition introduces an average inﬁdelity of approximately
Ω2/ν2, where Ω is the carrier Rabi frequency, which
varies depending on if the transition is to |D(cid:105) or to |u(cid:105)/|d(cid:105)
[19]. Summing over the six carrier transitions, the total
0/ν2. In princi-
inﬁdelity due to carrier excitation is 4Ω2
ple, it should be possible to time the gate to minimise
the inﬁdelity, however, this is diﬃcult in practise. The
standard approach to counteracting this inﬁdelity of us-
ing pulse shaping of the gate ﬁelds [33] will work far more
eﬀectively for this gate, and is therefore implemented to
eﬀectively remove this eﬀect.
Instead of switching the
gate pulses on and oﬀ near-instantaneously we shape the
pulses in a way that at the beginning and end of the
pulse the amplitude rises and falls adiabatically within a
window length of 10 µs which was found to be suﬃcient
using numerical simulations of the full gate dynamics.

Oﬀ-resonant carrier excitation due to the rf driving ﬁelds

Lightshifts and leakage outside the qubit subspace

In the standard Mølmer-Sørensen gate performed using
trapped ions, oﬀ-resonant excitation of the carrier transi-
tions can lead to a reduction in the average gate ﬁdelity.
There are a total of 6 RF-driven carrier transitions per

The RF-driven oﬀ-resonant carrier transitions in Eq.
16 will produce a net lightshift term arising from non-
vanishing A.C Stark shifts in the rotating frame of the
dressed state energy gap in Eq. 7:

which is a lightshift term.

For the gate described in this manuscript, the cou-
pling parameters for the leakage terms would be grf leak =
2π × 0.05 Hz and gµw = 2π × 3.8 Hz and we ﬁnd that
grf shift = 2π × 2.2 Hz. We suppress their eﬀect by in-
troducing an additional energy gap between the coupled
states, suppressing the couplings by making them oﬀ-
resonant. We accomplish this by making the Rabi fre-
quencies of the dressing ﬁelds for the two ions diﬀerent
by a small amount δ0 = Ωµw1 − Ωµw2 [26]. If δ0 (cid:29) η2ν,
this coupling is energetically suppressed. The dressing
ﬁeld Rabi frequencies used for the gate presented here
are Ωµw1 = 2π × 20.5 kHz and Ωµw2 = 2π × 21.6 kHz.
The lightshifts are compensated by shifting the frequen-
cies of the RF gate ﬁelds.

The lightshift ﬂuctuates from shot-to-shot due to the
thermal spread in the phonon number, which scales as the
square root of the mean phonon number. The strength
of this term for our gate parameters is gph = 2π × 0.7 Hz
and 2π × 0.3 Hz for ions 1 and 2 respectively. The ef-
fect of this shift is already small, and could be further
reduced by an increase in microwave Rabi frequency and
reduction of the mode temperature.

Diﬀerent Zeeman splitting due to the magnetic-ﬁeld gradient

(cid:0)e2/2π0M ν2(cid:1)1/3

The two ions are aligned along the magnetic-ﬁeld gra-
dient which determines the z-axis. Therefore they feel
a diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld, resulting in a diﬀerence in
Zeeman splitting ∆B = gµB∂zBz∆Z, where ∆Z =
is the distance between the two ions.
This diﬀerence yields additional terms in the Hamilto-
nian in the rotating frame corresponding to the bare en-
ergy structure. Due to the four microwave driving ﬁelds
the following additional terms are obtained:

multiplied by ∆Ωµwi

Further increasing the gate ﬁdelity

The inﬁdelity of our demonstrated gate is dominated
by heating of the motional mode, and depolarization
of the qubit.
Increasing the speed of the gate reduces
both sources of inﬁdelity. In addition, the heating rate
can be further reduced by increasing the trap frequency.
By modifying our gate parameters (including the size of
the magnetic ﬁeld gradient) the inﬁdelities can be dra-
matically reduced and fault-tolerant operation is easily
achievable.

We have modeled the following parameters: Ωµw/2π =
10 kHz , Ω0/2π = 198 kHz, ν/2π = 1.1 MHz, η =
0.0071 (which corresponds to a magnetic ﬁeld gradient
∂zBz = 150 T/m), with pulse shaping using a sin2(t)
proﬁle with rise and fall duration tshaping = 10π/ν. In-
stead of applying an imbalance between Ωµw1 and Ωµw2,
we have detuned the microwave transitions equally by
2π × 0.5 kHz with respect to the |0(cid:105)i levels [26]. To check
these changes do not substantially increase the gate’s
intrinsic inﬁdelities discussed above, we have simulated
the gate performance, namely the gate state ﬁdelity for
each one of the four possible states in the code space
{|D, D(cid:105) ,|D, 0(cid:48)(cid:105) ,|0(cid:48), D(cid:105) ,|0(cid:48), 0(cid:48)(cid:105)}, from which we calcu-
late the gate process ﬁdelity as their average.
In the
simulation, we consider a vibrational mode with a cut-
oﬀ ncut = 15 and no further approximations have been
made. Taking into account a depolarisation time of 2 s
(as previously measured using our dressed-state system
[28]) as well as a stretch-mode heating rate of 1.3 s−1
(heating rate as measured in the relevant apparatus and
scaled to 1.1 MHz;
if using an ion chip with 150 µm
ion-electrode distance, the expected tenfold increase in

j /2∆2

Our method can be applied to construct a large scale
quantum computer. We have developed a detailed engi-
neering blueprint for this purpose [21]. Here we discuss
important considerations relevant to our method. Indi-
vidual addressing of ions in the same entanglement zone
is achieved using the local magnetic ﬁeld gradients, while
individual addressing of ions in diﬀerent zones is achieved
by applying local voltages to position ions in diﬀerent
zones in a diﬀerent magnetic oﬀset ﬁeld. The crosstalk
between ions i and j for a square pulse resonant with ion
i can be characterised by the time-averaged excitation
probability of ion j, given by Cij ≈ Ω2
ij, where Ωj
is the Rabi frequency of the desired transition in ion j
and ∆ij is the frequency separation between the transi-
tions in the two ions [35]. In a single entanglement zone,
the frequency separation between the Zeeman sublevels
of the ion pair for the parameters in the example case
in the previous section is 9.8 MHz. For the microwave
dressing ﬁelds, Rabi frequencies Ωµw/2π = 10 kHz are
used, and therefore the crosstalk values for the dressing
ﬁelds are C12 = C21 = 5.2 × 10−7. For the rf ﬁelds used
to drive the two-qubit gate, the crosstalk values would be
C12 = C21 = 2.0×10−4 for square pulse shapes, however,
the ﬁelds amplitudes would be shaped with a sin2 proﬁle
as demonstrated in this work. Shaping the pulse ampli-
tudes further reduces the crosstalk by several orders of
magnitude. To see this, a numerical simulation of a two-
level system driven by a ﬁeld with Rabi frequency Ω(t)
and detuning δ was performed. The Rabi frequency was
varied in time starting with a sin2 shape ramp from Ω = 0
to Ω = Ωmax for a time tw, followed by a hold at Ωmax
for a time th, and ﬁnally a second sin2 shape ramp down
to Ω = 0 in time tw. It was found that for δ > 10Ωmax
and tw > π/Ωmax, the error is reduced to < 10−7. This
detuning requirement is fulﬁlled for both the rf and mi-
crowave dressing ﬁelds in this example. Therefore the
crosstalk between ions in a single zone is < 10−6, and is
therefore negligible compared to other error sources.

As mentioned, individual addressing of ions in diﬀer-
ent zones is achieved by positioning the ions in diﬀer-
ent zones in a diﬀerent local static magnetic oﬀset ﬁeld
achieved making use of the position dependent magnetic
ﬁeld originating from the local static magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dient within each zone. Ions that are not being addressed
sit at magnetic ﬁeld B1 corresponding to position z1,
while ions that require to be addressed are moved to posi-

tion z2 resulting in a magnetic ﬁeld B2. As an example, if
B2−B1 = 2 G, the Zeeman states of the ions that are not
being addressed are 2.8 MHz oﬀ-resonant. The crosstalk
for such a frequency separation with the parameters in
the example case is 6.4 × 10−6 for the microwave dress-
ing ﬁelds, and < 10−7 for the shaped rf gate ﬁeld pulse.
Other types of gates can then be introduced by position-
ing the ions in diﬀerent locations resulting in additional
magnetic oﬀset ﬁelds B3, B4 etc. The minimal set of
gates required for a universal quantum computer follow-
ing the surface code error correction scheme described in
Ref.
[36] consists of two single qubit gates (Hadamard
+ π/8 σz-rotation) and a two-qubit entangling gate such
as the one presented in this work. Therefore there are
four oﬀset magnetic ﬁelds required: No interaction, sin-
gle qubit Hadamard, single qubit π/8 σz-rotation and
two-qubit gate. The total required range of magnetic
ﬁeld oﬀsets is therefore approximately 6 G for an arbi-
trarily large processor. Additional operations could be
added by increasing the range of magnetic ﬁeld oﬀsets if
required.

The currents creating the static magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ents local to each gate zone are applied permanently and
are not switched on or oﬀ. An alternative method to
select arbitrary gate zones for gate execution is to add
an additional current carrying wire to each gate zone.
The low current passing through this wire in each gate
zone creating the required diﬀerent levels of magnetic
ﬁeld need to be switched in order to individually address
ions in diﬀerent zones. Here, currents of ≈ 100 mA need
to be applied to the wires to ramp the local oﬀset B-ﬁeld
from B1 to B2 (a diﬀerence of ≈ 2 G) which would then
shift the qubit frequency into resonance with a partic-
ular set of global gate ﬁelds. Diﬀerent levels of current
are applied to relevant coils to shift the qubit frequencies
into resonance with diﬀerent global gate ﬁelds. On-chip
digital-to-analogue converters can be used to control the
currents with 2 MS/s and 16 bit precision. A realistic
timing sequence for a two-qubit gate operation for exam-
ple would then be a 5 µs ramp from B1 to B2, followed
by the gate operation which is then followed by a second
5 µs ramp from B2 back to B1 where an integrated ﬁlter
produces a smooth waveform.
