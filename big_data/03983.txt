ON ROOTS OF UNITY IN ORBITS OF RATIONAL

FUNCTIONS

ALINA OSTAFE

Abstract. In this paper we characterise univariate rational func-
tions over a number ﬁeld K having inﬁnitely many points in the
cyclotomic closure Kc for which the orbit contains a root of unity.
Our results are similar to previous results of Dvornicich and Zan-
nier describing all polynomials having inﬁnitely many preperiodic
points which are roots of unity.

1. Introduction and statements

1.1. Motivation. For a rational function h ∈ K(X) over a number
ﬁeld K, we deﬁne the nth iterate of h by

h(0) = X,

h(n) = h(h(n−1)), n ≥ 1.

For an element α ∈ Q we deﬁne the orbit of h at α as the set

(1.1)

Orbh(α) = {αn | α0 = α and αn = h(αn−1), n = 0, 1, . . .}.

We use the convention that the orbit terminates if for some n ≥ 0, αn
is a pole of h and, in this case, Orbh(α) is a ﬁnite set.

If the point αn in (1.1) is deﬁned, then α0 is not a pole of h(n) and
αn = h(n)(α0). However, the fact that the evaluation h(n)(α0) is deﬁned
does not imply the existence of αn, since this latter point is deﬁned if
and only if all the previous points of the orbit (1.1) are deﬁned and αn−1
is not a pole of h. For instance, let h(X) = 1/X. Then h(2)(X) = X
and we see that h(2)(0) = 0, but α2 = h(h(0)) is not deﬁned as 0 is a
pole for h.

In this paper we are looking at the presence of roots of unity in
orbits (1.1) of univariate rational functions.
In particular, we prove
that unless the rational function is very special, there are ﬁnitely many
initial points that are roots of unity such that the corresponding orbit
contains another root of unity. In fact our result is more general.

This work is motivated by a similar result of Dvornicich and Zan-
nier [2, Theorem 2] that applies only for preperiodic points of univariate
polynomials (for a multivariate characterisation see [4, Theorem 34]).

Our methods follow the same ideas and technique of [2], including
a sharp Hilbert’s irreducibility theorem for cyclotomic extensions [2,
Corollary 1] and an extension of Loxton’s result [5, Theorem 1] in rep-
resenting cyclotomic integers as short combination of roots of unity [2,
Theorem L]. We note that a more general Hilbert irreducibility theo-
rem over cyclotomic ﬁelds has been obtained by Zannier [8, Theorem
2.1], which may be of use for further generalisations of the results of [2]
and of this paper. In Section 1.3 we suggest such a generalisation that
covers these results in a uniﬁed scenario.

1.2. Notation, conventions and deﬁnitions. We use the following
notations:

Q: the algebraic closure of Q;
U: the set of all roots of unity in C;
K: number ﬁeld;
Kc = K(U): the cyclotomic closure of K;
C(α): the maximum of absolute values of the conjugates over
Q of an algebraic number α;
Kc
Td: the Chebyshev polynomial of degree d; it is uniquely deter-
mined by the equation Td(x + x−1) = xd + x−d.

A: the set of α ∈ Kc such that C(α) ≤ A;

Deﬁnition 1.1 (Special rational functions). We call a rational func-
tion h ∈ K(X) to be special if h is a conjugate (with respect to the
group action given by PGL2(K) on K(X)) to ±X d or to ±Td(X).

For a rational function h ∈ K(X), we deﬁne

(1.2)

Sh = {α ∈ Kc | αk ∈ U for some k ≥ 1},

where αk is deﬁned as in (1.1).

As remarked before, if αk ∈ U for some k ≥ 1, then αk = h(k)(α),
and h(ℓ)(α) is well deﬁned, that is, h(ℓ)(α) is not a pole for h, for all
ℓ < k.

1.3. Main results. Our goal is to prove that the set Sh is ﬁnite unless
the rational function h is special. Let Per(h) be the set of the periodic
points of h (that is points which generate purely periodic orbits) and
let Preper(h) be the set of the pre-periodic points of h (that is, points
that have a periodic point in their orbits).

If f is a polynomial, then the ﬁniteness (under some natural condi-
tions) of the set Per(f )∩U, which is a subset of Sf , follows immediately
as a very special case from a more general result of Dvornicich and Zan-
nier [2]. More precisely, let f ∈ K[X] be of degree at least 2. Then,
by [2, Theorem 2], the set Preper(f ) ∩ Kc is ﬁnite unless, for some

ON ROOTS OF UNITY IN ORBITS OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

3

linear polynomial L ∈ Q[X] and for some ε = ±1, (L ◦ f ◦ L−1)(X) is
either (εX)d or Td(εX).

Here we extend the ﬁniteness property of Per(f ) ∩ U to the full set
Sf , as well as obtain such a result for non-special rational functions,
see Deﬁnition 1.1.

Theorem 1.2. Let h = f /g ∈ K(X), where f, g ∈ K[X] with deg f =
d and deg g = e. Assume that d − e > 1 or d − e < 0, and that
max{d, e} ≥ 2. If f (X) − Y mg(X) as a polynomial in X does not have
a root in Kc(Y ) for all positive integers m ≤ degX f , then Sh is ﬁnite
unless h is special.

It is also natural to ask whether [2, Theorem 2] can be extended in

full and thus investigate the ﬁniteness of the set

(1.3)

Th(A) = {α ∈ Kc | αk ∈ Kc

A for some k ≥ 1},

where αk is deﬁned in (1.1).

For any rational function h = f /g satisfying the degree conditions
in Theorem 1.2 there is a constant Lh such that if C(γ) > Lh, then the
sequence C(h(n)(γ)), n = 1, 2, . . ., is strictly monotonically increasing
or decreasing (depending on the degrees of f and g), see Section 2.3
below. Hence we have Preper(h) ∩ Kc ⊆ Th(Lh) and also Sh = Th(1).
Unfortunately some underlying tools seem to be missing in this situa-
tion.

Maybe one can start with a possibly easier problem, that is, for a ∈ N

and a rational function h ∈ K(X), prove the ﬁniteness of the set

Sh,a = {α ∈ K(Ua) | αk ∈ Ua for some k ≥ 1},

where Ua = {t ∈ Q | tn = a for some n ≥ 1}.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Hilbert’s Irreducibility Theorem over Kc. We need the fol-
lowing result due to Dvornicich and Zannier [2, Corollary 1]. We
present it however in a weaker form that we need for our results, but
the proof is given within the proof of [2, Corollary 1].

Lemma 2.1. Let f ∈ Kc[X, Y ] such that f (X, Y m) as a polynomial in
X does not have a root in Kc(Y ) for all positive integers m ≤ degX f .
Then f (X, ζ) has a root in Kc for only ﬁnitely many roots of unity ζ.

Proof. As we have mentioned, this statement is a part of the proof of [2,
Corollary 1]: the polynomial g which appears in the proof satisﬁes
the same condition as our polynomial f (we also note that here we
alternated to roles of the variables X and Y ).
(cid:3)

4

ALINA OSTAFE

We have the following straightforward consequence.

Corollary 2.2. Let f ∈ Kc[X, Y ] and a linear polynomial L = aY +b ∈
Kc[X] such that f (X, L(Y m)) as a polynomial in X does not have a root
in Kc(Y ) for all positive integers m ≤ degX f . Then f (X, β) has a root
in Kc for only ﬁnitely many elements β ∈ L(U).

Proof. For any β = aζ + b ∈ L(U), with ζ ∈ U, f (X, β) has a root in
Kc if and only if g(X, ζ) has a root in Kc, where g = f (X, aY + b) ∈
Kc[X, Y ]. The result thus follows directly from Lemma 2.1 applied
with the polynomial g.
(cid:3)

2.2. Representations via linear combinations of roots of unity.
We have the following extension of a result of Loxton [5], which we
present in the form given by [2, Theorem L].

Lemma 2.3. There exists a number B and a ﬁnite set E ⊂ K with
#E ≤ [K : Q] such that any algebraic integer α ∈ Kc can be written as
i=1 ciξi, where ci ∈ E, ξi ∈ U and b ≤ #E · R(BC(α)), where

R : R → R is any Loxton function.

α = Pb

2.3. The size of elements in orbits. In this section we prove some
useful simple facts about the size of iterates. Although these results
follow by simple computations and may be found in other sources, we
decided to give all the details for the proofs of these statements.
Lemma 2.4. Let f = X d + ad−1X d−1 + · · · + a0 ∈ K[X] of degree
d ≥ 2 and α ∈ Q such that |α|v > maxd−1
j=0{1, |aj|v} for some non-
archimidean absolute value | · |v of K (normalised in some way and
extended to K = Q). Then {|f (n)(α)|v}n∈N is strictly increasing.

Proof. The proof follows by induction on n ≥ 1. For n = 1 we need to
prove that |f (α)|v > |α|v. We note that

|αd − f (α)|v ≤ max

j=0,...,d−1

|ajαj|v = max

j=0,...,d−1

|aj|v|α|j

v < |α|d
v.

Hence

|f (α)|v = max{|αd − f (α)|v, |α|d

v} = |α|d
v.

The result now follows as |α|d

v > |α|v.

Exactly in the same way one can prove that |f (n)(α)|v > |f (n−1)(α)|v
(cid:3)

for any n > 1.

Corollary 2.5. Let h = f /g, where f, g ∈ K[X] are deﬁned by

f = X d + ad−1X d−1 + · · · + a0,

g = X e + be−1X e−1 + · · · + b0.

Let α ∈ Q be such that |α|v > max0≤i≤d,0≤j≤e{1, |ai|v, |bj|v} for some
non-archimidean absolute value | · |v of K.

(i) If d − e > 1, then {|h(n)(α)|v}n∈N is strictly increasing.
(ii) If d − e < 0, then {|h(n)(α)|v}n∈N is strictly decreasing, satisfying

|h(n)(α)|v < 1 for n ≥ 1.

Proof. We proceed by induction over n ≥ 1. For n = 1 one has to
prove that |h(α)|v > |α|v for (i) and |h(α)|v < |α|v for (ii). From the
proof of Lemma 2.4 and the deﬁnition of α, one has |f (α)|v = |α|d
v and
|g(α)|v = |α|e

v, and thus |h(α)|v = |α|d−e

.

v

For (i), since d−e > 1, the conclusion follows. For (ii), since |α|v > 1,

we have |α|−1

v < 1 < |α|v, and the statement follows in this case too.

We assume now the statements of (i) and (ii) true for iterates up to
n − 1 and the proof for n goes exactly the same way as for n = 1. (cid:3)

Next we study the growth of iterates of a rational function h ∈ K(X)

in points from Sh.

Lemma 2.6. Let h = f /g, where f, g ∈ K[X] are deﬁned by

f = X d + ad−1X d−1 + · · · + a0,

g = X e + be−1X e−1 + · · · + b0.

Let α ∈ Q be such that

(2.1)

(i) If d − e > 1, then {|h(n)(α)|}n∈N is strictly increasing.
(ii) If d − e < 0, then {|h(n)(α)|}n∈N is strictly decreasing, satisfying

|h(n)(α)| < 1 for n ≥ 1.

Proof. The proof for both (i) and (ii) goes by induction over n. We
prove only the case n = 1, since the implication from n − 1 to n follows
exactly the same lines. We have |h(α)| = |f (α)|
|g(α)| .

(i) We look ﬁrst at |f (α)|. As above, by the triangle inequality, we

have |f (α)| ≥ |α|d − |f (α) − αd|. Since

d−1

|f (α) − αd| = |ad−1αd−1 + · · · + a0| ≤ |α|d−1

|ai|,

Xi=0

where the last inequality follows since |α| ≥ 1, we conclude that

(2.2)

|f (α)| ≥ |α|d−1 |α| −

We also have that

|g(α)| = |αe + be−1αe−1 + · · · + b0| ≤ |α|e 1 +

ALINA OSTAFE

Putting together (2.2) and (2.3), and recalling the initial assump-

tion (2.1), we conclude that |h(α)| > |α|.

(ii) Follows the same as the previous case, but we will use the anal-
ogous inequality (2.2) for g and (2.3) for f . In other words, similar
computations as above lead to

|g(α)| ≥ |α|e−1 |α| −

|f (α)| ≤ |α|d 1 +

Using again (2.1) and d < e, we conclude that |h(α)| < 1.

Corollary 2.7. Let h = f /g, where f, g ∈ K[X] are deﬁned by

f = X d + ad−1X d−1 + · · · + a0,

g = X e + be−1X e−1 + · · · + b0.

Proof. It follows from Lemma 2.6.

(i) either C(cid:0)h(k)(α)(cid:1) ≤ A for some k ≥ 1 if d − e > 1,
(ii) or C(cid:0)h(k)(α)(cid:1) ≥ 1 for some k ≥ 1 if d − e < 0.
Then C(cid:0)h(ℓ)(α)(cid:1) ≤ Lh for all ℓ < k.
and that C(cid:0)h(ℓ)(α)(cid:1) > Lh for some ℓ < k. This means that there
exists a conjugate of h(ℓ)(α), which we denote by σ(cid:0)h(ℓ)(α)(cid:1), such that
|σ(cid:0)h(ℓ)(α)(cid:1) | > Lh. We note that σ(cid:0)h(ℓ)(α)(cid:1) = σ(h)(ℓ)(σ(α)), where

σ(h) is the rational function h in which we replace the coeﬃcients of
f and g by σ(ai) and σ(bj), i = 0, . . . , d − 1, j = 0, . . . , e − 1. We
apply now Lemma 2.6 with the rational function σ(h) and the point
j=0 |σ(bj)|, A}

Indeed, assume that d − e > 1

i=0 |σ(ai)|+Pe−1

The case d − e < 0 follows the same way from Lemma 2.6, obtain-

σ(cid:0)h(ℓ)(α)(cid:1) with |σ(cid:0)h(ℓ)(α)(cid:1) | > max{1+Pd−1
to conclude that {σ(cid:0)h(ℓ+n)(α)(cid:1)}n∈N is strictly increasing. Thus, we
obtain a contradiction with C(cid:0)h(k)(α)(cid:1) ≤ A for k > ℓ.
ing |σ(cid:0)h(ℓ+n)(α)(cid:1) | < 1 for all n ≥ 1, and thus a contradiction with
C(cid:0)h(k)(α)(cid:1) ≥ 1.

2.4. Growth of the number of terms in rational function it-
erates. The main result of the paper relies on the following result of
Fuchs and Zannier [3, Corollary] which says that the number of terms
in the iterates h(n) of a rational function h ∈ K(X) goes to inﬁnity with

(cid:3)

ON ROOTS OF UNITY IN ORBITS OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

n (see [7] for a previous result applying only to polynomials). Here is
the more precise statement:

Lemma 2.8. Let q ∈ K(X) be a non-constant rational function and
let h ∈ K(X) be of degree d ≥ 2. Assume that h is not special. Then,
for any n ≥ 3, h(n) is a ratio of polynomials having all together at least
1
log 5 ((n − 2) log d − log 2016) terms.

3. Proof of Theorem 1.2

Indeed,

We proceed ﬁrst by bringing the rational function h to a monic ra-
tional function (that is, both numerator and denominator are monic
if h = cf /g with c ∈ K∗ and f and g are
polynomials).
monic, then there exists a linear polynomial L = µX ∈ Q[X] such
that hµ = L ◦ h ◦ L−1 is monic, that is µ is a solution to the equa-
tion cµ1−d+e = 1. Without loss of generality (enlarging the ﬁeld K if
necessary) we can assume that µ ∈ K.

Since h(k)

µ = L ◦ h(k) ◦ L−1, we can work with the monic rational

function

(3.1)

hµ(X) = cµ

f (µ−1X)
g(µ−1X)

=

fµ(X)
gµ(X)

,

where
fµ(X) = X d + ad−1X d−1 + · · ·+ a0,

gµ(X) = X e + be−1X e−1 + · · · + b0.

We are now left with proving the ﬁniteness of the set

Sh,µ = {α ∈ Kc | h(k)

µ (α) ∈ L(U) for some k ≥ 1}

(rather than of the set Sh).

The proof follows the approach of the proof of [2, Theorem 2], cou-
pled with Corollary 2.2. Indeed, by (3.1) simple computations show
that fµ(X) − L(Y m)gµ(X) as a polynomial in X does not have a root
in Kc(Y ) if and only if f (X) −Y mg(X) has the same property, which is
satisﬁed by our hypothesis. Thus, we apply Corollary 2.2 with the poly-
nomial fµ(X) − Y gµ(X) and get that there are ﬁnitely many β ∈ L(U)
such that fµ(X) − βgµ(X) has a zero in Kc. This implies that there are
ﬁnitely many β ∈ L(U) such that hµ(X) − β has a zero in Kc. Denote
by S the set of such β ∈ L(U).

It is suﬃcient to prove that, for any β ∈ S, there are ﬁnitely many

α ∈ Kc such that h(k)

µ (α) = β for some k ≥ 1.

Let Aµ = C(µ) where µ ∈ K is the coeﬃcient of the above linear
polynomial L(X) = µX. Thus, for any β = µξ ∈ L(U) for some ξ ∈ U,
we have C(β) = C(µξ) = Aµ.

8

ALINA OSTAFE

Let Lh be a positive integer deﬁned as in Corollary 2.7 with A re-
placed by Aµ. Let also M be a suﬃciently large positive integer, chosen
to satisfy

(3.2)

M >

Bh,K log 5 + log 2016

log max{d, e}

+ 2,

where Bh,K is deﬁned below to be a constant depending only on h and
K.

If k ≤ M, then obviously there are ﬁnitely many α ∈ Kc such that
h(k)
µ (α) = β for any β ∈ S.
We assume now k > M and we denote

Sh,µ(M) = {α ∈ Sh,µ | h(k)

µ (α) ∈ L(U) for some k > M},

where as above L(X) = µX.

By Corollary 2.7, for any α ∈ Sh,µ(M) we have that C(h(r)

µ (α)) ≤ Lh

for all r = 0, . . . , M.

Moreover, as in the proof of [2, Theorem 2], for any α ∈ Sh,µ(M)
and any non-archimidean place | · |v of K (normalised in some way and
extended to K = Q), we have that

|h(r)

µ (α)|v < max{1, |µ|v, |aj|v, |bj|v}

µ

for all r = 0, . . . , M, since otherwise, by Lemma 2.4, we have that
{|h(r+n)
(α)|v}n∈N is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing depending
on d − e > 1 or d < e, respectively, which contradicts h(k)
µ (α) ∈ L(U)
(and thus |h(k)
µ (α)|v = |µξ|v = |µ|v for some ξ ∈ U) for some k > M.
Hence, taking a positive integer Dh,µ such that Dh,µai and Dh,µbj, i =
0, . . . , d − 1, j = 0, . . . , e − 1, and Dh,µµ are all algebraic integers, we
conclude that

|Dh,µh(r)

µ (α)|v < max{|Dh,µ|v, |Dh,µµ|v, |Dh,µaj|v, |Dh,µbj|v} ≤ 1,

and thus Dh,µh(r)
r = 0, . . . , M.

µ (α) are all algebraic integers for any α ∈ Kc and

Applying now Lemma 2.3 for Dh,µh(r)

µ (α), r = 0, . . . , M, there exist
a positive integer Bh,K and a ﬁnite set EK, depending only on hµ and
K such that, for every α ∈ Sh,µ(M) and every integer 0 ≤ r ≤ M, we
can write h(r)
µ (α) in the form
h(r)
µ (α) = cr,1ξr,1 + · · · + cr,Bh,Kξr,Bh,K,

(3.3)

r = 0, . . . , M,

where cr,i ∈ EK and ξr,i ∈ U.

Assume now that for M satisfying (3.2) the set Sh,µ(M) is inﬁnite.
Since for any α ∈ Sh,µ(M), h(r)
µ (α) can be written in the form (3.3), and
the set EK is ﬁnite, we can pick an inﬁnite subset Th,µ(M) of Sh,µ(M)

ON ROOTS OF UNITY IN ORBITS OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

such that, for any α ∈ Th,µ(M), the cr,i, dr,j ∈ EK in (3.3) are ﬁxed for
i, j = 1, . . . , Bh,K and r = 0, . . . , M. In other words, the coeﬃcients cr,i
do not depend on α.

As in the proof of [2, Theorem 2], we may use the ﬁrst equation
corresponding to r = 0 to replace α on the left-hand side of (3.3) and
thus obtain

Following the proof of [2, Theorem 2], which is based on the torsion

nal functions h(r)
µ (q(t)), r = 1, . . . , M, can be represented by a rational
function with at most Bh,K number of terms. We apply now Lemma 2.8
and conclude that

Bh,K ≥

log 5

((M − 2) log max{d, e} − log 2016) ,

which contradicts the choice of M as in (3.2). This concludes the proof.

4. Comments

It would be of interest to extend the result of [2] and of this paper to
the set (1.3). One important tool would be the Hilbert Irreducibility
Theorem over Kc, which for such extensions would mean to prove that
under some natural conditions, a polynomial g ∈ Kc[X, Y ] has the
property that g(X, α) is reducible over Kc for ﬁnitely many α ∈ Kc
with C(α) ≤ A. One way to start investigating such a result would
be to use ﬁrst the Loxton theorem and represent all such α in the
form η1ξ1 + . . . + ηBξB, where ηi ∈ E, i = 1, . . . , B, B a positive
number and E a ﬁnite set that depend only on K. We thus reduced the
problem to proving that there exist ﬁnitely many tuples (ξ1, . . . , ξB) ∈

10

ALINA OSTAFE

UB such that C(η1ξ1 + . . . + ηBξB) ≤ A and g(X, η1ξ1 + . . . + ηBξB)
is reducible over Kc. Then, one can apply the multivariate version
of Hilbert Irreducibility Theorem over cyclotomic ﬁelds with explicit
specialisations at the set of torsion points of GB
m due to Zannier, see [8,
Theorem 2.1].
