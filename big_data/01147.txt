Abstract. We investigate the distribution of diﬀerent classes of spectroscopically identiﬁed
sources and theoretical models in the color-color diagrams (CCDs) combining the near-infrared
(NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) data to develop a method to classify Outer Galaxy sources
detected with the Spitzer Space Telescope (hereafter Spitzer ) SMOG survey in the IRAC 3.6–
8.0 µm and MIPS 24 µm bands. We supplement the Spitzer data with the data from other
satellite and ground-based surveys. The main goal of our study is to discover and characterize
the population of intermediate- and low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Outer Galaxy
and use it to study star formation in a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent environment than the Galaxy inside
the solar circle. Since the YSOs can be confused with evolved stars in the MIR, these classes of
objects need to be carefully separated. Here we present the initial results of our analysis using
the Ks-[8.0] vs. Ks-[24] CCD as an example. The evolved stars separated from YSOs in the
YSO selection process will be investigated in detail in the follow-up study.

1. Introduction
Star formation studies in the Galaxy has been concentrating on the nearby molecular clouds
(e.g., [1]; [2]; [3]) or distant massive star formation regions (e.g., [4]), leaving vast clouds of
low- and intermediate-mass star formation at larger distances undiscovered. We have initiated
a systematic study of star formation in the Outer Galaxy to uncover the population of YSOs
in these previously unstudied clouds and investigate the impact of the environment on the star
formation process. The Spitzer IRAC and MIPS cameras are ideally suited to investigate dusty
envelopes of YSOs. We use the data from the “Spitzer Mapping of the Outer Galaxy” survey
(SMOG; PI Sean Carey) that covered ∼24 deg2 region in the Outer Galaxy: l = (102◦, 109◦),
b = (-0.2◦, 3.2◦) in the IRAC 3.6–8.0 µm and MIPS 24 µm bands (see Figure 1). This region
that we refer to as “L105”, samples a range of environments and star formation activities. In
Figure 1 we marked the boundary of the Cep OB2 association with a blue/black (color electronic
version/black and white printout). The H II regions from the [5] catalog are shown as blue/black
circles and identiﬁed by their numbers.

In the Outer Galaxy we expect a contamination from evolved stars such as Asymptotic Giant
Branch (AGB) stars, post-AGB objects and planetary nebulae (PNe), or more massive ones such
as Red SuperGiants (RSGs), or even Yellow HyperGiants (YHGs). Here, as an example, we
concentrate on identifying the location of the low- and intermediate-mass evolved stars (AGBs,

post-AGBs and PNe) in the Ks-[8.0] vs. Ks-[24] color-color space. We are developing a method
to disentagle these classes of sources from the sample of YSO candidates. A detailed description
of the YSO selection process will be presented in detail in a future paper.

2. The Ks-[8.0] vs. Ks-[24] color–color diagram
The quite robust method to separate diﬀerent classes of objects, especially when distances to
them are unknown, are CCDs and a comparison of new objects with already classiﬁed sources
or with theoretical models. One of such diagrams, the Ks-[8.0] vs. Ks-[24] color–color diagram,
is known to separate the C-rich from O-rich AGB stars (e.g.
In addition, theoretical
models from the Grid of RSG and AGB ModelS (GRAMS, [7], [8]) are available. The GRAMS
grid consists of 66 000 O-rich and 12 000 C-rich models that span the range of stellar and
dust shell parameters expected for evolved stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In the
Outer Galay we expect metallicities more typical for the LMC or even for the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) than for the Galaxy Bulge, so the GRAMS models can be safely applied. On the
other hand, there are also available self-consistent time-dependent hydrodynamic (HD) radiative
transfer calculations for gaseous dusty circumstellar shells around C-rich and O-rich stars in
the ﬁnal stages of their AGB/post-AGB evolution ([9]). These calculations are based on one
particular stellar evolutionary track and single dust size grain (a=0.05 µm) for its both chemical
compositions: amorphous carbon (AC: [10]) and astronomical silicates (ASil: [11]).

[6]).

Figure 2 shows the Ks–[8.0] vs. Ks–[24] CCD and compares the GRAMS models for C-rich
stars (black dots) with the HD evolutionary track for AC dust (dashed red/dark-gray line), and
those for O-rich ones (blue/gray dots) with the HD track for ASil dust (dashed green/light-gray
line). The end of the AGB/beginning of the post-AGB phase of evolution (time ”0”: see [9] for
a deﬁnition) is marked by the corresponding big star symbol. The large temporal luminosity
and mass loss variations, which are associated with thermal pulses during the AGB phase can
be recognized as bluer ”loops” (see [9] for details). Despite the fact that HD models were
not adjusted for any speciﬁc metallicity, the agreement between the GRAMS models and the
HD evolutionary tracks is quite impressive. The advantage of the HD models is an additional
coverage of the post-AGB phase of stellar evolution (to the left from the big star symbols).

Figure 2, but know the last 200 years of AGB and about 1000 years of post-AGB evolution

are connected by the solid lines) with sources from the LMC and SMC classiﬁed by [12] and
[13]. The C-rich evolved stars are shown by black symbols, while O-rich ones are represented by
blue/gray symbols. All types of YSOs deﬁned by [12] and [13] based on their spectra are shown
by magenta/gray triangles. The HD models during the AGB phase are plotted in intervals of
100 years (HD models of the post-AGB phase are not equidistant in time), so their number
density is a direct measure of the probability of ﬁnding objects in diﬀerent parts of the diagram.
Figure 3 shows that there is a clear separation between the C-rich and O-rich AGB objects,
which can be explained well by the HD models, and that post-AGB objects overlap completely
with YSOs. The O-rich post-AGB phase of our original HD models seems to be too blue. The
reason is too fast drop of ﬂux in [8.0] band in case of astronomical silicates due to too large
optical depth during the transition from AGB to post-AGB phase. This is caused by too small
velocity of O-rich dust shell (see Figure 21 in [9]). By black solid lines we have delimited a
region of Ks–[8.0] vs. Ks–[24] CCD, where majority of post-AGB sources and YSOs are located
(compare to Figure 10 of [6]).

In Figure 4, the Ks-[8.0] vs. Ks-[24] CCD for all SMOG sources with good quality data at all
bands is shown. Due to the small number of good quality measurements by MIPS at 24 µm the
total number of plotted objects is only 15 311. Note, that the total number of sources detected
at shorter wavelengths by IRAC is 2 836 618. The SMOG sources, which are located in the
”post-AGBs & YSOs” region on this CCD (249) are shown by larger symbols then the rest of
the SMOG objects. One characteristic result can be seen for SMOG objects located in the L105
Outer Galaxy region: there is relatively small number of C-rich AGB sources located around
positions suggested by the HD track for C-rich dust (red/dark gray solid line), and especially
those with large mass loss rates (the reddest) are missing. In addition, the reddening vector
shown in Fig.4 constructed for AV = 10 demonstrates that our HD tracks computed for the
lowest mass loss of the order of 10−7 M(cid:12) yr−1, will move out of the clump of the SMOG points
around KS-[8]∼ 0.8.

are shown by dots, which are replaced by
open large diamonds in the ”post-AGBs &

The end of
the AGB/beginning of post-AGB phase of
evolution is marked by the corresponding big
star symbol. The mass loss at the end of the
AGB evolution started to decrease about 200
years before moment ”0”. The ”post-AGBs &
YSOs” region is marked with the black solid
lines (contains 249 objects). The black arrow
shows the reddening vector for AV = 10.

3. Summary
To investigate star formation in the Outer Galaxy we have started analyzing the SMOG data
obtained by IRAC and MIPS instruments onboard Spitzer. We demonstrated that the Ks-[8.0]
vs. Ks-[24] CCD separated the C-rich and O-rich AGBs well (see also [6]), but this CCD is
not able to disentangle YSOs from post-AGB objects. Our color–color cuts in the Ks-[8.0]
vs. Ks-[24] CCD select ∼250 post-AGB objects and YSO candidates. Color-color cuts based
on a set of NIR/MIR CCDs will allow us to select an initial sample of YSO and evolved star
candidates. To classify these sources and remove contaminants from each sample, we will perform
the spectral energy distribution ﬁtting and visual inspection the sources’ environments using the
multiwavelength images.
