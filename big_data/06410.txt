Abstract

We study a simple model of a foraging animal that modiﬁes the substrate on which it moves. This substrate
provides its only resource, and the forager manage it by taking a limited portion at each visited site. The
resource recovers its value after the visit following a relaxation law. We study diﬀerent scenarios to analyze
the eﬃciency of the managing strategy, corresponding to control the bite size. We observe the non trivial
emergence of a home range, that is visited in a periodic way. The duration of the corresponding cycles and
the transient until it emerges is aﬀected by the bite size. Our results show that the most eﬃcient use of the
resource, measured as the balance between gathering and travelled distance, corresponds to foragers that
take larger portions but without exhausting the resource. We also analyze the use of space determining the
number of attractors of the dynamics, and we observe that it depends on the bite size and the recovery time
of the resource.

1. Introduction

Complex patterns of animal movement arise
from the interaction between the individual and
the environment (Turchin, 1998). Despite usual
assumptions of randomness made for the sake of
mathematical tractability, these patterns are in
general not random, and their characterization
and dynamics is currently a subject of study
of biologists, mathematicians and physicists.
Complementary tools are used in this context:
reaction-diﬀusion mechanisms (Okubo and Levin,
2002;
2006;
Schat et al., 1996) and simulation of individuals
walks (Viswanathan et al., 2011, 1996; Giuggioli,
2009).

Mikhailov and Calenbuhr,

Of particular interest are the mechanisms un-
derlying the formation of patterns in foraging
walks. Many animals move around their habi-
tats collecting food from patches of renewable
resources such as fruit, nectar, pollen,
leaves,

seeds, etc. Often these animals play an im-
portant role, through mutualistic interactions, in
the pollination, seeds dispersal and spread of the
plants that provide their resource (Levey, 2005;
Morales and Carlo, 2006; Carlo and Morales, 2008;
Herrera et al., 2011; Cresswell, 1997). For these
reasons their trajectories arise from an interweaving
of the rules of movement, the spatial distribution of
the substrate (Cresswell, 1997; Ohashi et al., 2007),
and the interaction between both (Abramson et al.,
2014; Kazimierski et al., 2015). All of them are de-
cisive for the emerging phenomenology and thus a
complete characterization of the observed patterns
requires an integral approach.

Foraging on renewable resources has been stud-
ied with a focus on ﬁnding optimal search strategies
under diﬀerent assumptions of animal perception
and memory (Bartumeus et al., 2002; Barton et al.,
2009; Fronhofer et al., 2013). Some animals, for
example, are able to ﬁnd proﬁtable routes with-
out much computational power (Zollner and Lima,
1999; Bell, 1991). Also, much discussion has
been devoted to animals’ search paths and whether
L´evy walks or ﬂights are predominant in na-
ture (Viswanathan et al., 1996; Benhamou, 2007;

Preprint submitted to Journal of Theoretical Biology

Edwards et al., 2007; Reynolds, 2012; Boyer et al.,
2009). While these examples focus on the cognitive
abilities of the foragers, another approach considers
the study of emerging patterns in the use of space
as a result of the interaction between the behav-
ior of the animal and the spatial structure of the
environment, i.e. as a feedback mechanism.

In this regard, it is a fact that animals do not
use all available space but prefer to stay in a lim-
ited region, their home range.
It remains of par-
ticular interest to understand which characteris-
tics of the system contribute to the formation of
these ranges (Giuggioli et al., 2006). In our previ-
ous study (Abramson et al., 2014) a similar model
to the one presented in this work was analyzed,
showing that two simple rules (preference of near-
est plants and relaxation of the consumed resource),
are enough to produce bounded home ranges. Such
ﬁnite ranges arise even in the absence of any kind of
memory of the walker or of a cost involved in move-
ment. In the present work we generalize that model
assigning to the spatially distributed resource a
more speciﬁc role in the promotion of the emer-
gence of a home range.

Among several aspects associated to the bene-
ﬁts of establishing a home range, we want to con-
sider the availability of the resource and the eﬃ-
cacy of its sustainable exploitation. In this regard
the harvesting strategy is crucial, as a non eﬃcient
activity can lead to the exhaustion of the available
food. It is possible to assume that animals are able
to recognize the energetic value of cropping larger
bites, and to select bite size based on trade-oﬀs be-
tween rapid harvesting and rapid thorough diges-
tion (Shipley, 2007). There is then a clear com-
promise between bite size and cropping rate, with
the two usually inversely related, though there are
at least two interpretations of this eﬀect. Some
authors (Chacon and Stobbs, 1976; Hodgson, 1981,
1985) consider that this relationship responds to
the need of grazing herbivores to balance small bite
sizes with a higher cropping rate. However, other
authors (Spalinger and Hobbs, 1992) attribute the
relation between bite size and cropping rate to
anatomic limitations associated to body mechanics
and a competition between chewing and cropping.
The eﬀect of bite size on cropping rate goes be-
yond the locality of a single patch of vegetation,
and when the distribution of the resource is very
heterogeneous in space it also aﬀects the proﬁle
of foraging across patches. At the same time, the
topological properties of the distribution of the re-

2

source can impose additional constraints on the in-
take rate. When the forager travels without avail-
ability limitations among patches, the intake rate is
deﬁned by the bite size and the rate at which it can
be processed in the mouth. But when the search
time is longer than the time needed to chewing
and/or swallowing food acquired from the last bite,
the eﬀect of the landscape on the foraging dynam-
ics starts to be important (Shipley and Spalinger,
1992). Consequently, bite size/intake rate relation-
ships are frequently included in foraging models de-
signed to predict behavior, intake, and productiv-
ity of animals across landscapes (Moen, 1997; Illius,
1999; Fryxell, 2004; Morales, 2005).

In the present paper we consider three parame-
ters of relevance for the interplay between real for-
agers and their environment: bite size (the amount
of resource gathered at each foraging site), cost of
movement and cost of stay. We show that these
factors aﬀect the ability to use the resource more
or less eﬃciently or, in any case, the self organized
optimization of the resource.

2. Model deﬁnition and dynamics

The model consists of a walker that moves on a
substrate modifying it, representing a forager mov-
ing from plant to plant in order to collect food. The
walker follows simple rules of movement, to be de-
scribed below, and the substrate recovers from the
depletion produced by the visits. Let us describe
these basic rules in some detail.

The substrate consists of N sites distributed uni-
formly at random positions in the unit square. Each
site represents a patch of vegetation that the ani-
mal can visit to collect food, and will be referred to
as “plants” below. Each site is endowed with a crop
size (a load of fruit, for example) fi(t) ∈ (0, fi(0)),
with fi(0) initially assigned at random.

The walker visits the sites following a rule
that mimics that of a feeding animal. At each
visit of the walker the crop is reduced by an
amount b, the bite size that characterizes the
behavior of
foragers (Morales and Carlo, 2006;
Carlo and Morales, 2008; Shipley, 2007). We as-
sume that the determinant factor of the movement
is the proximity of the food. This is in fact the case
with many foraging species, particularly if the dis-
tribution of the resource is not extremely heteroge-
neous. Nevertheless, since each visit consumes the
resource, we assume that a site i will not be chosen
if fi(t) − b < 0. If the nearest plant does not have

enough food, the walker chooses the next nearest
that does so.

Finally, the vegetation substrate is subject to a
replenishment of the crop of each plant: after a visit
and a reduction b of its crop, the plant recovers that
amount τ time steps later, until it saturates to its
initial value fi(0). This simple relaxation dynamics
can represent a ripening process, for example, in
such a way that the crop size available to the animal
is only the ripe fruit.

As mentioned above, the model just described
is similar to the one analyzed by Abramson et al.
(2014).
In this work we generalize that analysis,
studying the dependence of the walks (and, in par-
ticular, of their cycles) on three magnitudes of rele-
vance for real foragers: bite size, cost of movement
and cost of stay. The present model does not ul-
timately explore all the aspects of a real foraging
dynamics in detail, but isolates some very relevant
factors that allow us to obtain interesting new re-
sults. For the sake of understanding the basic inter-
play between the walker and the environment, we
have not taken into account several details, such
as satiation, rest, return to the burrow or nest, or
other activities related to intra- or interspeciﬁc in-
teractions.

3. Results

Let us consider a single animal in the system.
After a transient that depends on initial condi-

tions, the walk settles on a periodic trajectory,
a cycle. This is the same behavior observed by
Abramson et al. (2014), where it was argued that
this cycles are analog to home ranges of animals.
We emphasize that these ranges arise in a very sim-
ple model, where the walker has no memory of the
positions of the resource.

We studied the dependence of the properties of
this cycles on the size of the bite, b. Relevant re-
sults are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 where we plot,
as a function of τ , the period of the cycles, hT i,
and the habitat usage measured as the fraction of
sites visited during the cycle with respect to the
size of the system, hSi. Both magnitudes are aver-
aged over 1000 realizations of the walk with diﬀer-
ent random distribution of the sites for each simu-
lation. The diﬀerent curves correspond to values of
the bite size b = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. As expected,
and as in (Abramson et al., 2014), both magnitudes
grow with τ , since a slower relaxation time of the
resource requires that the walker explores farther in
order to ﬁnd food.

It is worth mentioning that, to some extent, these
results depend on the total time of simulation. The
longest period observed cannot be longer than half
of it, since at least one repetition is necessary for
the detection of a cycle. For this reason we have
repeated the analysis shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for
progressively longer simulation times. The result is
exactly as the one observed in (Abramson et al.,
2014):
longer periods are detected, with corre-

sponding larger values of their average hT i but,
most importantly, the average space usage does not
increase with total time. This indicates the exis-
tence of well deﬁned ranges for the walker.

The dependence of hT i and hSi on b is also not
obvious. On the one hand we observe that, the
larger the bite size, the larger the use of space
(Fig. 2). This is understandable: more plants are
visited if the bite size is larger, since the crop of each
plant is consumed faster. Observe, however, that
the period of the cycles decreases with the growth of
the bite size (Fig. 1). That is, animals that harvest
less resource require less space (as argued above),
but it takes them longer to complete their trajec-
tories. The reason for this could be the fact that
small bites allow the walker to oscillate back and
forth between nearby plants while fi − b > 0, eﬀec-
tively producing sub-cycles inside the home range.
Animals with larger b, on the other hand, would
ﬁnd it more diﬃcult to return to recently visited
sites, because they are probably depleted.

If such is the case, it could be possible to see how
the number of sub-cycles increases as the bite size
decreases, for a ﬁxed value of τ . Figure 3 shows this
dependence: the number of two-step sub-cycles per
cycle, N2, averaged over 1000 realizations. It can
be seen that it has a maximum around b ≈ 0.15, de-
creasing rapidly to reach 0 when b = 0.4. It should
be noted that, when b > 0.5, two-steps cycles are
not possible because the resource has been depleted
to a value that prevents an immediate visit, until
the relaxation has replenished it. We have not ob-

served sub-cycles involving 3 sites in our simula-
tions, but two-step cycles are clearly seen directly
in the trajectories, as we show in Figure 4. In this
graph we can also observe that, while the walker
with b = 0.1 completes only one cycle during that
range of time, the walker with b = 0.4 does four;
the cycle of the ﬁrst one is longer, but the eﬀective
sites visited are less.

4. Eﬃciency

is particularly relevant

Among the multiple interests on foraging be-
it
the evalua-
havior
tion of
its eﬃciency. The pioneering work of
MacArthur and Pianka (1966) set up the basis for
the concept of optimal foraging (Pyke et al., 1977;
Stephens and Krebs, 1986), where the authors pro-
pose that one of the governing aspects of foraging
behavior is the energy intake maximization.

Within the limitations of our model, the fact
that the animals collect a harvest and follow a path
within their home ranges allows several interesting
observations in terms of the eﬃciency of the ex-
ploitation of the resource. Let us consider ﬁrst a
consequence of the results just discussed in the pre-
vious section.

We have seen that the walkers that take a larger
bite follow shorter cycles (Fig. 1). We could say

that larger bite sizes are more eﬃcient for the ex-
ploitation of the resource, because of the increased
cost of moving int(f /b) times between sites to de-
plete them. If b is larger, there are less sub-cycles
and each step is, in this sense, more eﬃcient. In-
deed, this concept of eﬃciency can be applied to
the whole walk, even to the transient before the sta-
tionary cycle is reached. The walker with smaller
bites would require more steps to “ﬁnd” the cycle,
because of the steps lost in sub-cycles, and the tran-
sient would be longer. Figure 5 shows that this is
the case: the number of transient steps T0 (averaged
over 1000 realizations) as a function of b, shows a
decay that stabilizes after b = 0.4, as expected. The
walker with the smallest bite size (b = 0.1) needs
on average 8 times more steps to establish a home
range than the walker with 4 times the bite size,
b = 0.4.

These arguments and results could indicate that,
in real animals, there would be a strong evolution-
ary pressure towards larger bites or harvests, since
they seem to ensure a more eﬃcient use of the re-
source. For real animals, though, bite size is one
of many interacting factors that play a part in for-
aging behavior (Shipley and Spalinger, 1992). As
discussed by Shipley (2007), herbivores’ decisions
are based on a tradeoﬀ between food intake and
other aspects of the resource and its use, such as
chewing and swallowing, digestion, distance trav-
elled, distance from refuge, patch residence time,
etc. These tradeoﬀs may be very complicated and
species speciﬁc; for example larger bites may mean

5

an increased predation risk because of longer perch-
ing times to deplete a cluster of fruit, or less risk
because of more spare time to scan for predators
(Illius and Fitzgibbon, 1994; Fortin et al., 2004).
In summary, while larger bites enable the walker
to increase nutrient intake (needed for survival,
growth, reproduction), there might be penaliza-
tions that require a tradeoﬀ with other factors shap-
ing the movement.

A more precise way of quantifying the eﬃciency
of the walkers consists in the consideration of an
internal energy. Let us say that this energy in-
creases with the ingestion of food at each step, and
decreases with the distance travelled to obtain it.
That is, if the walker is at site i at time t − 1 and
visits site j at time t:

E(t) = E(t − 1) + g(b) − h(dij ),

(1)

where g(b) and h(dij ) are functions that character-
ize the changes in the internal energy of the walker.
It is reasonable to expect h to be a monotonically
increasing function of dij, but in principle we do not
know the precise form of either g or h. Indeed, they
may be diﬀerent for diﬀerent species or classes (for
example mammals, birds and insects), and even for
the same species in diﬀerent stages of their natural
history (breeding, preparing for hibernation, etc.).
Let us consider, for the sake of simplicity, that en-
ergy is lost in proportion to the distance travelled,
as if the animal were moving at a constant speed:
h(dij ) = α dij , with a rate α characterizing the en-
ergy loss, the “cost of movement” mentioned above.
Similarly, one could consider a linear dependence of
g(b), assuming that each portion of food provides
an amount of energy. In such a case a phase dia-
gram for the total energy at the end of a prescribed
time would look like the one shown in Fig. 6 (top).
The darker colors code for higher energy, and it is
seen that the most eﬃcient walkers are the ones
that gather larger crops, while spending less during
their movement, as expected.

However, the linear dependence of g on b is not
the best to assume. Animals collecting small fruits
from fruit clusters, for example, should spend time
gathering each fruitlet. So, animals collecting larger
crops need to spend more time at each site than
those that take a single fruitlet or a small bite and
move on. A real forager could tend to take a crop
somewhere in the middle of the available resource
at each site. This has been observed in the behavior
of Dromiciops gliroides feeding on the fruits of Tris-
terix corymbosus,
for example (Di Virgilio et al.,

2014). For these reasons it is more sound to con-
sider a penalization for animals with larger bite size.
The exact form is not important, for the reasons
discussed above. So, let us consider the following:
g(b) = β(b) b, with β(b) a linearly decreasing func-
tion of b:

E(t) = E(t − 1) + β(b) b − α dij .

(2)

Typical phase diagrams corresponding to this
model are shown in Fig. 6 (center and bottom).
Each plot corresponds to a diﬀerent strength of the
penalization of large bites, as shown in the insets
by the function g(b). The penalization of larger
bite size is responsible for the reduced energy seen

approaching the right side of the plot. For each set
of parameters (α, τ , g, etc.), there is an optimum
bite size and there would be an evolutionary pres-
sure to adopt a strategy (a bite size b) to exploit
it.

5. Discussion

We have analyzed a simple model of a forager
with deterministic rules that moves modifying its
substrate. The interplay between foraging and
relaxation of the substrate produces several non-
intuitive behaviors, akin to those observed in real
systems.

First of all, the walker not only ﬁnds a home
range (a cycle), but also sub-cycles inside that prin-
cipal cycle. These regions of persistent interest are
also a feature of real animals. The period and the
space usage of the cycles, as well as the transient
regime, are largely determined by the bite size, the
portion that the walker gathers from each site, i.e.
by its strategy in the use of the resource. When
the resource is spatially distributed in a patchy en-
vironment there is a tradeoﬀ between the energy
saving due to a bounded mobility and the risk of
locally depleting the resource. Thus, the beneﬁts
that a rich patch provides fades out with the ex-
haustion of the resource. The study of this phe-
nomenon is addressed by the marginal value theo-
rem (Charnov, 1976).
In an ideal case, a forager
should stay in a patch until the harvesting has de-
pleted the resource to a point at which the expected
energy gained from staying is bellow the expected
gain if travelling to a new unexploited patch. En-
ergy balance and eﬃciency are then central aspects
of the forager’s behavior. Most models of optimal
foraging theory consider that foragers posess cog-
nitive and perceptual skills that allow them to col-
lect information about patch locations. The time
spent between patches is not associated to a search
activity but to a directed travel. In this work we
assumed that the foragers have limited perceptual
or cognitive abilities (Bell, 1991; Zollner and Lima,
1999) and that searching for the resource is part of
the foraging behavior.

Our results show that the walker with a smaller
bite size is less eﬃcient in ﬁnding its home range.
When found, the period of their cycles are longer,
and their use of space is more limited (visiting fewer
sites), than those corresponding to walkers with
larger bites. The longer period of those ineﬃcient
walkers arises from the formation of sub-cycles: the

walker visits two sites repeatedly in sequence until
it depletes them and moves on. In this fashion they
visit less sites and take more steps: this is the be-
havior that we have called ineﬃcient. Our results
show that the more voracious walker ﬁnds more eas-
ily its home range and exploits it more eﬃciently.

On the light of these results, it could be rea-
sonable to expect an evolutionary pressure towards
the choice of larger bites, other parameters be-
ing equal.
Indeed, it is known that if large bites
are available, animals can meet energy require-
ments more easily, allowing more time for other
life requisites such as reproduction, competition
avoidance, predator evasion and thermo-regulation
(Shipley, 2007; Fortin et al., 2004; Pellew, 1984;
Bergman et al., 2001). There is however a caveat:
bite size may interact with other factors of the for-
aging behavior and natural history, and a tradeoﬀ
may arise. We have analyzed a phenomenological
model of such a tradeoﬀ in the form of an internal
energy that the walker stores by harvesting the re-
source, and dissipates by travelling. A monotonic
dependence of the rate of energy intake on bite size
does favor larger bites. But even a slight penal-
ization of this rate for larger bites shows that in-
termediate harvesting sizes may be more favorable.
The action of such mechanisms might be behind
the observed behavior of foragers that consume only
part of the available crop at each plant, such as D.
gliroides (Di Virgilio et al., 2014).

The manner in which an animal uses its habitat
to collect resources certainly has an impact on the
way it will interact with conspeciﬁcs or competitors
sharing the space. With regard to this, the fraction
of space usage is one of the relevant variables that
would determine if home ranges overlap or not and,
eventually, determine also the carrying capacity of
the system. Let us brieﬂy discuss a ﬁnal character-
ization of the eﬃciency of diﬀerent strategies of for-
aging, that is also relevant if more than one agent
is present in the system, or if part of the habitat
becomes destroyed or otherwise inaccessible. It is
the number of atractors (distinct cycles) of the dy-
namics.
Imagine placing the walker at all the N
possible initial positions of a given substrate. The
question is: how many cycles the walker can ﬁnd?
And, moreover, how does this number depend on
the parameters of the model?

Figure 7 shows the number of atractors given a
distribution of the resource, as a function of the re-
laxation time τ and the bite size b, averaged over 10
realizations. We can see that the number of atrac-

tors depends on both parameters: the possible cy-
cles are very few (lighter shade) if the bite size or
the recovery time are large. On the other hand, if
the bite size (or the relaxation time) is small, there
are many possible ways of traversing the range and
many possible home ranges. The presence of more
animals competing for the same resource (even in
the absence of any direct interaction) would aﬀect
the eﬃciency of its use. Even if larger bites would
require less time to exploit the resource (the strat-
egy that we have termed eﬃcient), the overlap of
the home ranges of several foragers might produce a
pressure in the opposite direction. A strategy with
a smaller bite, instead, which requires less space
and allocates more attractors in the same substrate,
may be favored. This aspect of the model is cur-
rently under study.

The emerging properties of our model improves
over the baseline set by Abramson et al. (2014),
providing a mechanistic explanation of many phe-
nomena observed in the behavior of foraging an-
imals. The study of the relevance of the present
ﬁndings in systems such as the mutualistic interac-
tion between D. gliroides and T. corymbosus, and
their relevance as keystone species in the Andean
temperate forest (Amico and Aizen, 2000; Aizen,
2003), will be further explored.
