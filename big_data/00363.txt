Crossed Andreev reﬂection (cAR) is a scattering phenomenon that happens in a quantum trans-
port set-up consisting of two normal metals (NM) attached to a superconductor (SC), where an
electron incident from one NM results in a hole emerging in the other. Typically, an electron
tunneling (ET) through the superconductor from one NM to the other competes with cAR and
masks the signature of cAR in the conductance spectrum. We propose a novel way to enhance
cAR over ET, so that one can clearly observe the signature of cAR by looking at the conductance
spectrum. Our proposal is a variant of the well-studied NM-SC-NM junction where the SC part of
the NM-SC-NM is side-coupled to another SC, which has a diﬀerent SC phase.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Andreev reﬂection (AR) is a scattering process that
happens at the interface of a normal metal (NM) and a
superconductor (SC) when a current is driven by an ex-
ternal bias across the interface. The Cooper-pair current
in the superconductor draws equal contributions from the
electron and hole channels of the normal metal. This phe-
nomenon, ﬁrst discovered by Andreev1 has been exten-
sively studied theoretically and experimentally for sev-
eral decades2–4. More recently, AR has played an impor-
tant role in predicting4,5 and observing6 transport signa-
tures of exotic Majorana fermions7 in condensed matter
systems. Also, intriguing transport properties of topo-
logical superconductors8 and junctions of superconduc-
tors with topological insulators9 have been understood
in terms of AR. The participation of electron and hole
excitations in scattering at a junction is not restricted
to having purely singlet or triplet superconductors de-
scribed by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation,
but can happen at junctions of interacting quantum wires
formed by spinless electrons10. These wires have no long
range superconducting order but have algebraically de-
caying superconducting correlations. In a single quantum
wire which has diﬀerent strengths of interaction in diﬀer-
ent regions, Andreev-like reﬂection happens when a wave
packet is incident on the junction from the side having
weaker attractive interaction to the side having stronger
attractive interaction. But, in steady state transport, the
Andreev-like reﬂection does not happen except when the
junction is formed by three wires11. Recent advances in
cold-atomic systems promise new testbeds in addition to
the conventional mesoscopic set-ups where such theoreti-
cal ﬁndings can be demonstrated experimentally. Hence,
Andreev reﬂection and related phenomena have found
interest in the ﬁeld of cold atomic systems as well12.

Crossed Andreev reﬂection (cAR) is a phenomenon
closely related to AR which happens in a system con-
sisting of two normal metals attached to a supercon-
ductor13–24. An electron incident on the SC from the
ﬁrst normal metal (NM1) gets absorbed into the SC

as a Cooper-pair, absorbing the second electron of the
Cooper-pair from the second normal metal (NM2), re-
sulting in a hole current in the second normal metal.
This happens when the distance between the two NM’s
connected to the SC is less than the superconducting co-
herence length. The phenomenon of cAR plays a key
role in the production of non-locally entangled electrons
by splitting Cooper pairs from the SC, which has been
demonstrated experimentally23. Also, cAR contributes
to the rich pattern of conductances in one-dimensional
NM-SC-NM systems with p−wave SC that hosts Majo-
rana fermions at its ends24. However, cAR is accompa-
nied by electron tunneling (ET) where the electron from
the NM1 tunnels into the NM2 as an electron. The sig-
nature of cAR is masked in transport experiments on
simple NSN systems due to a dominant ET. One tra-
ditional way to enhance cAR over ET has been to em-
ploy ferromagnets (FM’s) instead of NM’s 13–17. When
two FM’s are connected to the superconductor and the
easy axis directions of the two FM’s are chosen to be op-
posite, AR and ET are suppressed but cAR is not. This is
because, the Cooper pair is a spin-singlet and it absorbs
the up- and down- spins to form the singlet from the two
FM’s equally. Another proposal for enhancing cAR has
been to apply a Lorentz force on the quasiparticles de-
scribed by the BdG equations in two-dimensional SC’s
using magnetic ﬁeld and enhance cAR between two one-
dimensional NM’s attached to the SC18. Additionally,
having only barriers at the NM-SC junctions of a one-
dimensional NM-SC-NM set-up can enhance cAR over
ET, but cAR is enhanced only in a small range of param-
eters and the enhanced cAR currents are too small20,21.
In short, among the existing proposals, the FM-SC-FM
junctions have seen the most convincing experimental
demonstration of cAR enhanced over ET to date13.

In this paper, we propose a novel way to enhance cAR
which does not involve any ferromagnetic parts. Instead,
the superconducting part of the NM-SC-NM is attached
to another superconductor, which has a diﬀerent phase
of the SC order parameter. We discuss in detail the con-
ditions under which cAR is enhanced in such a system.

The paper is organized as follows: in section II, we dis-
cuss our proposal, in section III we present details of our
calculations, in section IV we present our results and dis-
cuss the underlying physics and ﬁnally in section V we
end with an overview of the bigger picture and conclud-
ing remarks.

II. OUR PROPOSAL

Our proposal consists of side-coupling the SC part

FIG. 1: A schematic diagram of the set-up. The supercon-
ductor in the NM-SC-NM is side-coupled (with strength g)
to another SC. The superconducting phases of the upper and
lower legs of the ladder are respectively 0 and −φ.

in the NM-SC-SM set-up with another SC (which has a
diﬀerent SC phase but the same magnitude of the super-
conducting pair potential) as shown in Fig. 1. We call
the side-coupled SC part of the system the “ladder”. We
show that a phase diﬀerence between the two legs of the
SC ladder can enhance cAR. Also, a suﬃciently strong
coupling between the two legs is necessary (but not suﬃ-
cient) to enhance cAR over ET. The enhancement can be
quite large when the energy-scale of coupling between the
two legs of the ladder is approximately equal to (but still
greater than) the superconducting energy scale in each
individual leg. This is the central result of our work.

where k = (2k2/2m − µ) and k is the momentum.
Each of these bands is doubly degenerate due to spin
(s =↑,↓). The spin index enters the Hamiltonian (1) only
while coupling the electron and hole bands, but is absent
in the transformed Hamiltonian (2). The Hamiltonians
for the NM regions on the left (x < 0) and right (x > a)

are given by H = (cid:80)

s c†s(x)(2k2/2m − µ)cs(x). Here

onwards, we shall leave out the spin index s. A fac-
tor of 2 for the spin will multiply the conductances in
the ﬁnal result. Physically, a σ-spin electron (σ =↑,↓)
from the electron band couples with a hole from the hole
band which is formed by the absence of a ¯σ-spin elec-
tron. Within the electron-bands (and also within the
hole-bands), the spins do not mix. The SC phases φλ
can be chosen to be φ1 = 0, and φ2 = −φ, without loss
of generality so that the phase diﬀerence between the two
superconducting legs of the ladder (φ1 − φ2) = φ. This
particular choice of the phases does not aﬀect the ﬁnal
expressions for scattering probabilities which determine
the conductances.

B. Wavefunctions

The solution to the Hamiltonian at any given energy
E will have a two-spinor ψ in the NM-regions (to repre-
sent the electron- and hole- channel) and a four-spinor
[ψT , χT ]T in the ladder region (since there are two
legs in the ladder, each of which hosts an electron and
a hole channel), where the spinors ψ and χ have the
form: ψ(x) = [ψe(x), ψh(x)]T for ∞ < x < ∞ and
χ(x) = [χe(x), χh(x)]T for 0 ≤ x ≤ a. In the NM re-
gions, the electrons and holes take momenta ±ke and
±kh respectively where ke/h =
2m(µ ± E)/2 at a
given energy E. Then, the scattering wavefunction in
the NM-regions for an electron incident from left onto
the ladder region at an energy E is given by:

where the index σ = ±1 denotes whether the mode is
right/left-mover, the index ν = ±1 refers to the anti-
bonding/bonding bands formed due to the hybridiza-
tion between two legs (λ = 1, 2) of the ladder (the
coupling strength g quantiﬁes such hybridization) and
p = e, h refer to electron-like and hole-like bands for
which σe/h = ± 1.

(cid:112)

C. Boundary conditions

We now have the form of wavefunctions in diﬀerent
regions. However, without deﬁning the boundary con-
ditions (BC’s), the problem is not complete. BC’s are
needed to solve for the unknown coeﬃcients in the wave-
function. The NM-SC junction generically has a barrier
to the electron tunneling which limits the electron trans-
mission. The BC at NM-SC interface is described by
continuity of the wave-function and a discontinuity of
the derivative2. The latter is the same as having a delta-
function barrier potential on the NM side of the NM-SC
junction, inﬁnitesimally close to the junction. It is well-
known2,3 that in the case of a weak barrier, the conduc-
tance of an NM-SC junction is dominated by Andreev re-
ﬂection and is typically larger than the conductance of a
ballistic spin-1/2 quantum wire 2e2/h and reaches a max-
imum value of 4e2/h. In the opposite limit of a strong
barrier, the conductance of the NM-SC junction in the
gap is suppressed except at the values of energy where the
superconductor hosts a state bound to the NM-SC inter-
face4. Since we are interested in enhancing cAR over ET,
we shall set the barrier strengths to zero to make the NM-
SC junctions fully transparent. In other words, both the
wavefunction and its derivative at the NM-SC interface
are continuous. But this ﬁxes the BC only for one leg of
the ladder. The BC for the other leg is given by a prob-
ability current conserving BC at the ends of the ladder
(i.e., x = 0, a). Such a BC that describes the lower leg
of the ladder has four-parameters in general as explored

3

for a ‘particle in box’ by Carreau et. al25. Imposing lo-
cality of the boundaries at x = 0 and x = a, this BC re-
duces to just two parameters: (q2,x0 +∂x)Ψ2(x)|x=x0 = 0,
where q2,x0 is the parameter with dimensions of inverse
length that describes the BC at x0 and is allowed to take
real number values. Locality of the boundaries means
that the NM-SC interfaces at x = 0, a are not connected
by any direct hopping as in the case of a periodic BC.
The limit qx0 → ∞ implies that the wavefunction is zero
at x = x0, while the limit qx0 → 0 implies that the ﬁrst
derivative of the wavefunction is zero at x0, allowing the
wavefunction to have a non-zero probability density at
x0. Here onwards, we shall work with the limit qx0 = 0
for both x0 = 0 and x0 = a since this limit qualitatively
corresponds to a lattice model of a SC ladder where the
last site of the second leg can have a ﬁnite probability
density. Below are the BC’s written down in the form of
equations:

= ∂xψ(x)|x=x

∂xψ(x)|x=x+
for x0 = 0, a.

ψ(x+
0 ) = ψ(x−0 ) ,
∂xχ(x)|x=x0 = 0
The wavefunctions given by Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), to-
gether with the BC (7) enable us to solve for the scat-
tering amplitudes: rn, ra, tn, ta and sσ,ν,p’s. We have
calculated the scattering amplitudes numerically for a di-
verse set of relevant parameters. Using these scattering
amplitudes, transconductance has been calculated. The
transconductance is the quantity of interest since it can
be experimentally measured.

D. Transconductance

The set-up under investigation is a three terminal set-
up. While the NM regions on left and right (extending
to x → ∓∞) form two terminals, the SC in the mid-
dle (maintained at a ﬁxed chemical potential µ) acts as a
reservoir for the charge current since charge current is not
conserved in the SC region. However, note that the prob-
ability current is conserved for the scattering process. We
are interested in calculating the diﬀerential transconduc-
tance for charge transport, GRL(E) = 2e dIR(E)/dE
- where dIR(E) is the change in current of the right
NM when the Fermi energy of the left NM is changed
from E to (E + dE), keeping the Fermi energies of the
ladder region and right NM at zero. Here, e is the
electronic charge and the factor of 2 is for the spin-
degeneracy. The Landauer-B¨uttiker formalism relates
the conductances in such transport set-up to the scatter-
ing amplitudes26. In terms of the scattering amplitudes
tn, ta and the velocities of electron and hole in the NM
vp(E) = |[∂kp/∂E]−1| (for p = e, h), the diﬀerential
transconductance GRL = 2e2
at a bias
E = eV (where V is the voltage) can be written as:

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We ﬁnd the transconductance GRL for a diverse set of
relevant parameters. It is easy to see from Eq. (8) that
the contributions of ET and cAR to the current on the
right NM are positive and negative respectively. Hence,
a negative GRL is a clear signature of cAR enhanced over
ET while a positive GRL implies the dominance of ET
over cAR.

FIG. 2: Left panel: The zero bias conductance GRL in units
of 2e2/h. Right panel: The logarithm of the gap in the dis-
persion (3) of the ladder region in units of ∆ (right). For both
panels, µ = 10∆, a = 6ξ, where ξ =

(cid:112)2/2m∆.

Firstly, we look at the zero-bias transconductance
GRL|V =0 as a function of the parameters φ and g and un-
derstand it in terms of the dispersion of the ladder region
given by Eq. (3). The left panel of Fig. 2 is a contour-plot
of GRL|V =0 and the right panel of Fig. 2 is a contour-plot
of the logarithm of the gap in units of ∆ (i.e., log [Eg/∆]),
both as functions of parameters g and φ. The gap closes
on the line (g/∆ ≥ 1, φ = π). And, cAR is enhanced as
g/∆ crosses 1 from left to right and this enhancement is
prominent around φ = π (at zero-bias). Further, as g/∆
crosses a value of 3, ET is enhanced to a value as high
as ∼ 0.75 · 2e2/h. This is because, the closing of the gap
is associated with the modes in the ladder region whose
wavefunctions have parts that are hyperbolic functions of
distance, turning into plane wave modes (two out of four
kν,p’s become real valued), which can then propagate in
the ladder region for long distances. The modes with dif-
ferent indices (σ, ν, p) interfere and whether an electron
or hole emerges out of the ladder into the second NM de-
pends on various parameters such as length a, chemical
potential µ, coupling g and the phase diﬀerence φ. One
can also see that having a non-zero phase diﬀerence φ is
crucial for enhanced cAR and cAR is enhanced the most
when φ = π (at zero-bias).

Now, we ﬁx φ = π and see how the subgap conduc-
tance spectrum changes as the coupling strength g is
changed. This is contrasted with the dispersion of the
ladder region, the topology of which changes when g/∆
is on either side of 1.
In Fig. 3, the subgap spectrum
(upper row) and the dispersion of the SC ladder (lower
row) for g/∆ = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 have been plotted. As g/∆
crosses over from 0.5 to 1.5, through 1.0, the conductance
spectrum shifts smoothly from being in the positive-half

region and the transconductance is explored for the coupling
strengths g/∆ = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5. Top row: The dispersion of the
SC ladder. Bottom row: The transconductance GRL (in units

to being in the negative-half of ordinate. This is a clear
signature of enhanced cAR as shown in the ﬁgure by the
green dot-dash lines. While having φ = π is important
in enhancing cAR, having suﬃciently strong g is equally
important and having g (cid:38) ∆ is ideal.

tion of (i) the phase diﬀerence φ and bias eV keeping µ = 10∆

tour plots, on the left, g = 0.5∆ and on the right, g = 1.5∆.

We shall now turn to the dependence of the conduc-
tance spectrum in the bias window to the phase diﬀerence

has contour plots of GRL as function of the bias eV and
phase diﬀerence φ for g = 0.5∆ (on left) and g = 1.5∆
(on right). In both the cases, µ = 10∆. One can see that
cAR is enhanced signiﬁcantly for the case g = 1.5∆ and
happens throughout in the bias window (−∆, ∆). Fur-
ther, the value of φ at which cAR is enhanced depends
on the value of the bias eV . Though cAR is enhanced in
the case of g = 0.5∆, this happens in very narrow regions
of the eV − φ plane and the value can go only as low as
−0.4· 2e2/h ( compared to the lower value of −0.6· 2e2/h
for the case of g = 1.5∆). It is worth noting that the
enhancement of cAR for g = 0.5∆ (though for a narrow
range of bias near ±∆) happens for non-zero φ.

The lower row of Fig. 4 has contour plots of GRL as
a function of the bias eV and chemical potential µ for
g = 0.5∆ (on left) and g = 1.5∆ (on right).
In both
the cases, φ = π. It is apparent from the contour-plots
that the enhancement of cAR is prominent in the case of
g = 1.5∆ (where cAR is enhanced throughout the bias
window around certain values of µ), compared to the
case of g = 0.5∆ (where cAR is enhanced at the ends of
the bias window around certain values of µ). Further, the
enhancement of cAR occurs at a series of µi’s. The diﬀer-
ence (µi+1−µi) increases with increasing µi and depends
on the value of the length a of the ladder region among
other parameters. To be more precise, the repeated oc-
currence of µi corresponds a periodicity in corresponding
2mµi/2), given by (ki+1 − ki)a ∼ π,
ki’s (where ki =
as in any Fabry-P´erot-type resonance27. Importantly, the
enhancement of cAR around the µi’s becomes less promi-
nent with increasing µi.

conductor. However, in reality long-range superconduct-
ing order is not possible in purely one dimension. This
limitation can be overcome by a proximate superconduc-
tor (pr-SC) in contact with the one-dimensional quantum
wire. Also, the Fermi energy and chemical potential in
the SC is assumed to be maintained at a particular value,
which means that a steady state current ﬂows into the SC
and the SC is grounded via a grounding electrode (GE).
In such cases, typically the wavefunction of the incident
electron will also have a non-zero amplitude in the pr-
SC or GE. This implies that our calculation does not
capture such realistic situations exactly. However, our
results apply in the limit where the current escapes into
the pr-SC or GE, but the BdG wavefunction in the pr-
SC or GE has a small amplitude. Also, at a qualitative
level we believe that our central result -the enhancement
of cAR over ET under the above discussed conditions
remains valid, though the magnitude of GRL may not
be as high as in a purely one-dimensional situation. It
will be an interesting and useful extension to study the
generalization of our work to the case where the SC is
two dimensional, similar in spirit to the set-up studied
by Yamashita et al16. Also, to implement our proposal
experimentally will be an interesting future direction.
