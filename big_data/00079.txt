of the projective plane PC2 to itself. In particular, we show an interesting connec-
tion between this map and an uncountable class of plane-ﬁlling curves coming from
folding a strip of paper. One of the goals of the paper is to show how techniques of
iterated monodromy groups can be used to obtain interesting topological properties
of dynamical systems. All our results are proved using algebraic computations with
self-similar groups.

Let us start from the end of the article, and describe the plane-ﬁlling curves.
Take a long narrow strip of paper and fold it in two. Then repeat the procedure
several times. Note that each time you have a choice of two directions of folding.
Then unfold it so that you get right angles at the creases. You will get something
like it is shown on Figure 1.

Figure 1. Folded paper

Let us record the way we folded the paper as a sequences of letters L, R, standing

for “left” and “right”, respectively.
Fold now two equal strips of paper in the same way (described by the same
sequence of letters L, R), and rotate one with respect to the other by 180◦. Put
them down so that their endpoints touch, see Figure 2.

You will get a closed curve γ, bounding a connected maze of square rooms. See
two examples of such mazes on Figure 3. The rooms are shaded black. Two red
dots mark the endpoints of the strips of paper, the green dots mark their midpoints
(i.e., the creases of the ﬁrst folding).

The marked points are vertices of a square (this easily follows from the con-
struction). Let us choose an inﬁnite sequence w = X1X2 . . . of letters L and R.
Let us draw rescaled closed curves γwn corresponding to ﬁnite sequences wn =
X1X2 . . . Xn of instructions in such a way that the marked points stay at the ver-
tices of a ﬁxed square Q. Let us parametrize the curves γwn uniformly (proportion-
ally to the arclength) by t ∈ [0, 1], so that γwn|[0,1/2] and γwn|[1/2,1] are copies of
the folded paper strip. Then the vertices of Q are γwn (0), γwn (1/2) (the endpoints
of the strips), and γwn(1/4), γwn (3/4) (their midpoints).

It follows from the description of the folding procedure that the maze γwn+1 is
obtained from the maze γwn by replacing each wall by a corner (so that the old

wall is the hypotenuse and the new walls are legs of an isosceles right triangle). We
get then a sequence of curves converging uniformly to some limit curve γX1X2....
The best known and studied example is the Heighway dragon curve, which corre-
sponds to a constant sequence w = LLL··· (or RRR··· ). It was deﬁned for the ﬁrst
time by NASA physicists J. Heighway, B. Banks, and W. Harter, and popularized
by M. Gardner in Scientiﬁc American.
It is also called sometimes the “Jurassic
Park Fractal”, as the curves γLn|[0,1/2] appear at the beginning of each chapter of
“Jurassic Park” by M. Crichton. The closed version γw is called sometimes the
twin-dragon curve. See the images of these curves on Figure 4. In [7, p. 190] a
relation of the twin dragon curve to numeration systems on complex numbers is
discussed.
Consider the group H of transformations of the plane generated by rotations by
180◦ around the vertices of the square Q (recall that it is the square whose vertices
are the endpoints and the midpoints of the strips of paper). The fundamental

4

domain of the group H is the square Q(cid:48) of twice bigger area such that vertices of Q
are midpoints of the sides of Q(cid:48). The quotient R2/H of the plane by the action of
H is homeomorphic to the sphere, and can be realized as the pillowcase obtained
from the square Q(cid:48) by folding its corners over the sides or the square Q.

If we take the curve γwn , then its image γwn /H on the pillowcase R2/H is a nice
Eulerian path tracing a square grid on the pillow, see Figure 5. The ﬁgure shows
how pieces of the curve γwn that are outside the fundamental domain Q(cid:48) are moved
inside by elements of H (actually, just by the generators).

to the curves γX2X3...Xn|[0,1/2] and γX2X3...Xn|[1/2,1]. The partition of γX1X2...Xn
into the deﬁned above sub-curves correspond to splitting the original strip of pa-
per in two (and “forgetting” about the ﬁrst folding). Moreover, the similari-
ties γX1X2...Xn|[0,1/4] → γX2X3...Xn|[0,1/2], γX1X2...Xn|[1/4,1/2] → γX2X3...Xn|[1/2,1],

γX1X2...Xn|[1/2,3/4] → γX2X3...Xn|[0,1/2], γX1X2...Xn|[3/4,1] → γX2X3...Xn|[1/2,1] are
restrictions of a branched self-covering SX1 : R2/H → R2/H. See Figure 6 for
a description of SX1. In the limit SX1 induces a piece-wise similarity map from
γX1X2... to γX2X3....

Figure 6. Pillowcase folding

Each of the curves γX1X2...Xn divides the sphere into two parts:

it separates
squares of diﬀerent color in a checkerboard coloring of the pillow R2/Z2. The
squares of one color are connected to each other by the corridors of the maze in a
tree-like fashion. It is reasonable to assume that in the limit the curve γX1X2... goes
around a dendrite that is a limit of the sequence of the trees bounded by γX1X2...Xn .
See, for example [10, II.7], where relation between plane-ﬁlling curves and “rivers”
they bound is explored.

The map SX1 induces a degree two branched covering of the dendrite bounded

by γX2X3... by the dendrite bounded by γX1X2....

The case of the twin-dragon curve was analyzed in detail by J. Milnor in [11].
He showed that the dendrites into which the curve γRRR.../H separates the sphere
can be naturally identiﬁed with the Julia set of the polynomial f (z) = z2 + c, where
c ≈ −0.228 + 1.115i is a root of the polynomial c3 + 2c2 + 2c + 2. Moreover, the
curve γRRR.../H goes around the dendrite in the same way as the Caratheodory loop
goes around the Julia set, so that the sphere R2/H is the mating of the polynomial
z2 + c with itself: it is obtained by gluing two Julia sets along the Caratheodory
loops so that one loop is a complex conjugate of the other.

The general paper folding curves γw were studied in [5] where a connection with
numeration systems on complex numbers was described (and closely related to the
“pillowcase folding” maps SL, SR : R2/H → R2/H).

In our paper we show a relation of the sphere-ﬁlling curves γw with dynamics of

. These Julia sets, which we will denote J(p0), are dendrites,

where pn+1 =
see Figure 8, if p0 belongs to the Julia set of f .
We show that the dendrites J(p0) are precisely the dendrites around which the
loops γw go. Moreover, the pillow R2/Z2 can be obtained by gluing two copies of
J(p0) along the Caratheodory loop going around J(p0) (one loop is glued to the
other using reﬂection with respect to a diameter). The curve γw is the image of the
Caratheodory loop. Moreover, the construction is dynamical: the map hp0 agrees
with the double coverings γX1X2... → γX2X3....

The paper is organized as follows. We start with a short reminder of the main
notions and techniques of self-similar groups. Section 3 is devoted to the study
of dynamics of the endomorphism F : PC2 → PC2. We start with computation
of the iterated monodromy group of F in Theorem 3.3. It is a self-similar group
acting on a degree 4 rooted tree. A computationally more convenient group is an
index two extension of IMG (F ), which is deﬁned in Subsection 3.2. We denote it
G, and it is the iterated monodromy group of the quotient of the dynamical system
F : PC2 → PC2 by complex conjugation.

The group IMG (F ) contains a natural subgroup G corresponding to non-autonomous

iterations hp of polynomials on the ﬁrst coordinate. It is not transitive on the levels
of the rooted tree, and we get an uncountable family of quotients of G coming from
restricting of G to invariant binary subtrees. A similar family of groups was studied
in [14, 18, 20, 16].
The graphs of the action of G on the levels of binary sub-trees are approximations
of the Julia sets J(p) of the non-autonomous iterations of hp (i.e., the corresponding
slices of the Julia set of F ). They are trees, in accordance with the fact that J(p)
are dendrites. We study these trees in 3.4 using recursive description of the gener-
ators of the self-similar group G. In particular, we describe inductive algorithms of
constructing these graphs, see Corollaries 3.11 and 3.12.

In the next subsection we study external angles to the Julia sets J(p), i.e., the
Caratheodory loops around them. The bundle of Caratheodory loops is the limit
space of the subgroup R of IMG (F ) generated by the loops not intersecting the
Julia sets J(p). We derive from the structure of the group R how the bundle
of Caratheodory loops is glued together from a Cantor set of circles, and which
external angles land on the points of the line z = p. In particular, we show that
for a countable set of parameters p (equal to the backward orbit of the unique real

1+p

) there are two external rays to J(p) landing on (p, p),

In Section 4 we deﬁne matings of the non-autonomous iterations hp. Namely, for

1+p

consider the corresponding slice J(p) of
every p in the Julia set of f (p) =
the Julia set of F , and the Caratheodory loop γ around it. Take then another copy
of J(p), and glue them together along the Caratheodory loops so that one loop is a
mirror image of the other with respect to the diameter containing an external angle
landing on (p, p). Note that in the case when p belongs to the backward orbit of the
real ﬁxed point of f , there are two such rays, and we have therefore two possible
choices for the mating.

G. Then the inclusion of the two copies of G induce semi-conjugacies of the limit
dynamical systems. We show that these semi-conjugacies realize the matings as
described in the previous paragraph.

We study then the limit dynamical system of (cid:98)G, i.e., the obtained matings.
We show that the group (cid:98)G contains a virtually abelian subgroup H such that the
inclusion H (cid:44)→ (cid:98)G induces a conjugacy of the limit dynamical systems. Then we show
that the limit space of (cid:98)G is a direct product of the Cantor set {L, R}∞ with the sphere

C/H, where H is the group of aﬃne transformations of the form z (cid:55)→ ±z + a + ib
for a, b ∈ Z, i.e., the pillowcase described above. The limit dynamical system acts
as the binary one-sided shift on the Cantor set and as multiplication by 1 + i or
1 − i on the pillowcase C/H (the choice of the coeﬃcient 1 ± i depends on the ﬁrst
letter of the corresponding element of the one-sided shift).

as we can choose one of two multiplications.

It follows that the constructed matings are Latt`es examples, though non-autonomous,

Since G < (cid:98)G the graphs of action of G on the levels of the tree are sub-graphs
of the graphs of action of (cid:98)G. The graphs of action of (cid:98)G are square grids on the

pillowcases. We show that the graphs of action of the two copies of G partition the
edges of the grid into two disjoint sub-trees, see Figure 23. These partitions of a
square grid into two subtrees converge to the decomposition of the pillowcase C/H
into two dendrites.

In Section 5 we relate the obtained results about the mating with the paper
folding curves. Namely, we show that the curve separating the two subtrees of
the square grid on C/H coincide with the paper-folding curves γv described in
this introduction, and that in the limit the curves γv converge to the image of the
Caratheodory loop in the mating.

The last section 6 describes structure of the slices of the Julia set of F that
correspond to the values of p belonging to the boundaries of the Fatou components

(cid:16) p−1

(cid:17)2

p+1

. We show that they are obtained by “ﬂattening” the boundaries
of f (p) =
of the Fatou components of the polynomials 16z2(1 − z)2 and (2z2 − 4z + 1)2.
In other terminology they are obtained by (rotated) tuning of these polynomials
by the polynomial z2 − 2. As usual, the proof is carried out using just algebraic
computations with the iterated monodromy groups.

2. Self-similar groups

We present here, in a very condensed form, the main deﬁnitions and results of
the theory of self-similar and iterated monodromy groups. For a more detailed
account, see [13, 15, 17, 19].

2.1. Covering bisets.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let G be a group. A G-biset is a set M together with commuting
left and right actions of G on M. In other words, we have two maps G × M → M :
(g, x) (cid:55)→ g · x and M × G → M : (x, g) (cid:55)→ x · g satisfying 1 · x = x · 1 = x for all
x ∈ M, and:

g1 · (g2 · x) = (g1g2) · x,
for all g1, g2 ∈ G, x ∈ M.

(x · g1) · g2 = x · (g1g2)

(g1 · x) · g2 = g1 · (x · g2)

8

VOLODYMYR NEKRASHEVYCH

We say that M is a covering biset if the right action of G on M is free, i.e., if
x · g = x implies g = 1. We also assume then that the number of right orbits is
ﬁnite.

Sometimes we also consider G1 − G2 bisets M, which are sets with commuting

left G1-action and right G2-action.

Deﬁnition 2.2. The isomorphism class of a pair (G, M), where G is a group and
M is a covering G-biset is called a self-similar group. Here two pairs (G1, M1) and
(G2, M2) are isomorphic (the corresponding self-similar groups are called equiva-
lent) if there exists an isomorphism φ : G1 → G2 and a bijection f : M1 → M2
such that f (g1 · x · g2) = φ(g1) · f (x) · φ(g2) for all g1, g2 ∈ G1 and x ∈ M1.

Let M be a covering G-biset. Consider the disjoint union M∗ =(cid:83)

Let M1, M2 be G-bisets. Then their tensor product, denoted M1 ⊗ M2, is the
quotient of M1 × M2 by the equivalence relation x1 ⊗ g · x2 = x1 · g ⊗ x2, with the
actions g1 · (x1 ⊗ x2)· g2 = (g1 · x1)⊗ (x2 · g2). It is easy to show that tensor product
of two covering bisets is a covering biset. It is also easy to see that (M1⊗ M2)⊗ M3
is naturally isomorphic to M1 ⊗ (M2 ⊗ M3).
n≥0 M⊗n of
the tensor powers M⊗n, n ≥ 0, where M⊗0 is the group G with the natural left
and right actions on itself. Denote by TM the set of orbits of the right action of G
on M∗. Then G acts on TM from the left. The set TM has a natural structure of
a rooted tree, where the right orbit of x1 ⊗ x2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ xn is connected by an edge
to the right orbit of x1 ⊗ x2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ xn ⊗ xn+1 for xi ∈ M. The left action of G on
TM is an action by automorphisms of the rooted tree (the root is the unique right
orbit of the action of G on itself).
The action of G on TM is not faithful in general. Let N be the kernel of the
action. Denote then by M/N the set of right N -orbits. It is easy to see that h · x
and x belong to one right N -orbit for every x ∈ M and h ∈ N , and that the left
and right actions of G on M descend to left and right actions of G/N on M/N .
We call the self-similar group (G/N, M/N ) the faithful quotient of the self-similar
group (G, M).

Consequently, X∗ =(cid:83)

2.2. Wreath recursions and virtual endomorphisms. Let (G, M) be a self-
similar group. We say that X = {x1, x2, . . . , xd} ⊂ M is a basis if it is a transversal
of right G-orbits. In other words, it is such a subset of M that for every x ∈ M
there exists a unique xi ∈ X such that x = xi · g for some g ∈ G. Note that g is
also uniquely determined by x, since the right action is free.
For every n the set X n = {a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ an : ai ∈ X} is a basis of M⊗n.
n≥0 X n is a basis of M∗. Here X 0 consists of a single empty
word identiﬁed with the identity element of G = M⊗0. We will usually write
a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ an just as a word a1a2 . . . an. We get a natural bijection between
the set TM of right orbits of M∗ and the set X∗ of ﬁnite words over X. The vertex
adjacency on the tree TM corresponds to a similar adjacency of elements of X∗: a
word v ∈ X∗ is adjacent to the words of the form vx for x ∈ X. In other words,
we consider X∗ as the right Cayley graph of the free monoid generated by X. The
action of G on TM is transformed hence to an action of G on X∗. We call this
action the self-similar action associated with the basis X of the biset M.
Let g ∈ G and x ∈ X, then there exist unique y ∈ X and h ∈ G such that
g · x = y · h. The induced map x (cid:55)→ y is a permutation coinciding with the

MATING, PAPER FOLDING, AND AN ENDOMORPHISM OF PC2

9

restriction of the action of g to the ﬁrst level X ⊂ X∗ of the rooted tree X∗. Let us
denote this permutation by σg ∈ Symm(X). Denote also h = g|x. We get a map

Φ : g (cid:55)→ σg(g|x)x∈X

from G to the semidirect product Symm(X) (cid:110) GX . The semi-direct product is
called the (permutational) wreath product of the symmetric group Symm(X) with
G.
It is easy to check that Φ : G → Symm(X) (cid:110) GX is a homomorphism. We
call it the wreath recursion associated with the self-similar group (G, M) (and the
basis X). If we change the basis X to another basis Y and identify GX and GY
with G|X| = G|Y | using some bijections X ←− {1, 2, . . . , d} → Y (i.e., orderings of
X and Y ), then the wreath recursions associated with X and Y diﬀer from each
other by a post-composition with an inner automorphism of the wreath product
Symm(d) (cid:110) Gd.

If the left action of G on the set of right orbits of M (i.e., on the ﬁrst level of
the tree TM) is transitive, then the self-similar group is uniquely determined by the
associated virtual endomorphism. Let x ∈ X, and denote by Gx the stabilizer of
the vertex x of the tree X∗. Then the associated virtual endomorphism φx is the
homomorphism φx : Gx → G deﬁned by the condition

g · x = x · φx(g).

The biset M is reconstructed (up to isomorphism) from the associated virtual
endomorphism in the following way. Let φ : G1 → G be a virtual endomorphism
(where G1 is a subgroup of ﬁnite index in G). Let Mφ be the set of formal expres-
sions [φ(g1)g2], for g1, g2 ∈ G, where [φ(g1)g2] = [φ(h1)h2] if and only if h−1
1 g1 ∈ G1
and φ(h−1
2 . This convention agrees with identiﬁcation of an expression
[φ(g1)g2] with the partial transformation

1 g1) = h2g−1

[φ(g1)g2] : x (cid:55)→ φ(xg1)g2,

1 g1) = h2g−1
2 .

of G. Note that φ(xg1)g2 = φ(xh1)h2 is equivalent to φ(xg1) = φ(xg1)φ(g−1
hence to φ(h−1
The set Mφ is invariant with respect to pre- and post-composition with right
translations x (cid:55)→ xg. We get hence a natural G-biset structure on Mφ. It is given
by the formulas

1 h1)h2g−1
2 ,

[φ(g1)g2] · g = [φ(g1)(g2g)],

g · [φ(g1)g2)] = [φ(gg1)g2].

It is easy to see that if φ = φx is the virtual endomorphism associated with a
covering biset M, then M is isomorphic to Mφ. Since the action of G on the set of
right orbits is transitive, every element y ∈ M can be written as y = g1 · x · g2, and
then the isomorphism maps y to [φ(g1)g2].

2.3. Iterated monodromy groups. Let M1, M0 be path connected and locally
path connected topological spaces or orbispaces. A topological correspondence is a
pair of maps f, ι : M1 → M0, where f is a ﬁnite degree covering map and ι is a
continuous map.
Choose a basepoint t ∈ M0. Let M be the set of pairs (z, (cid:96)), where z ∈ f−1(t),
and (cid:96) is homotopy class of a path in M0 from t to ι(z). The set M has a natural
structure of a covering π1(M0, t)-biset. Namely, for a loop γ ∈ π1(M0, t), denote by
(z, (cid:96))· γ the element (z, (cid:96)γ). Here and in the sequel we compose paths as functions:
in a product (cid:96)γ the path γ is passed ﬁrst, then (cid:96). Denote by γ · (z, (cid:96)) the element

10

VOLODYMYR NEKRASHEVYCH

(y, ι(γz)(cid:96)), where γz is the unique lift of γ by f that starts at z, and y is the end
of γz.
A basis of M is any set {(z1, (cid:96)1), (z2, (cid:96)2), . . . , (zd, (cid:96)d), where d = deg f , and
f−1(t) = {z1, z2, . . . , zd}.
monodromy group of the correspondence f, ι : M1 → M0.

The faithful quotient of the self-similar group (π1(M0, t), M) is called the iterated
The virtual endomorphism associated with the biset M is equal to ι∗ : π1(M1) →
π1(M0), where π1(M1) is identiﬁed with a subgroup ﬁnite index in π1(M0) by the
isomorphism f∗. It is well deﬁned up to compositions with inner automorphisms of
π1(M0), as any virtual endomorphism associated with a self-similar group.
If f : M → M is a branched self-covering, then we may transform it into a
topological correspondence by removing from M the closure P of the union of the
forward orbits of branch points of M .
If P is not big enough, in particular, if
it does not disconnect M , then we can consider the topological correspondence
f, ι : M1 → M0, where M0 = M \ P , M1 = f−1(M0), and ι : M1 → M0 is the
identical embedding. This is done, for example, if f is a post-critically ﬁnite rational
function, or a post-critically ﬁnite endomorphism of PC2 (which means that P is a
union of a ﬁnite number of varieties). In these cases we represent the elements of
M just as paths (cid:96) = ι((cid:96)), since their endpoints are uniquely determined.

2.4. Contracting self-similar groups. Let M be a covering G-biset, and let X
be a basis of M. For every v ∈ X∗ and g ∈ G denote by g|v the unique element
such that g · v = u · g|v for some u ∈ X∗. We call it the section of g in v.

Deﬁnition 2.3. The self-similar group (G, M) (with a chosen basis X of M) is
said to be contracting if there exists a ﬁnite set N ⊂ G such that for every g ∈ G
there exists n such that g|v ∈ N for every v ∈ X k such that k ≥ n. The smallest
set N satisfying the above condition is called the nucleus of the group.

It is proved in [13, Corollary 2.11.7] that the property of a biset to be hyperbolic
does not depend on the choice of a basis X. The nucleus, however, depends on X.
Since a biset M and a basis X is uniquely determined, up to an isomorphism, by
the associated wreath recursion, we call a wreath recursion G → Symm(X) (cid:110) GX
contracting if the corresponding self-similar group is contracting. Sometimes we
say that a G-biset M is hyperbolic if the self-similar group (G, M) is contracting.
It is easy to see that if (G, M) is contracting, then its faithful quotient is also
contracting.
The nucleus N satisﬁes the property that g|x ∈ N for all g ∈ N and x ∈ X. We
will often represent N as an automaton using its Moore diagram. It is the oriented
graph with the set of vertices N in which for every g ∈ N and x ∈ X we have an
arrow from g to g|x labeled by x|y, where y is the image of x under the action of g
on the ﬁrst level of the tree X∗, i.e., we have g · x = y · g|x.
Let (G, M) be a contracting self-similar group, and let X ⊂ M be a basis.
Consider the space X−ω of left-inﬁnite sequences . . . x2x1 of elements of X. We say
that . . . x2x1, . . . y2y1 ∈ X−ω are asymptotically equivalent if there exists a sequence
gn ∈ G taking a ﬁnite number of values such that gn(xn . . . x1) = yn . . . y1 (with
respect to the action of G on X∗). The quotient of the topological space X−ω by the
asymptotic equivalence relation is called the limit space of the group (G, M), and is
denoted JG. The shift . . . x2x1 (cid:55)→ . . . x3x2 agrees with the asymptotic equivalence

relation, so that it induces a continuous map s : JG → JG. We call the pair (JG, s)
the limit dynamical system of the self-similar group.

One can show, see [13, Theorem 3.6.3], that two sequences . . . x2x1 and . . . y2y1
are asymptotically equivalent if and only if there exists an oriented path . . . e2e1 of
arrows in the Moore diagram of the nucleus such that en is labeled by xn|yn.
Consider now X−ω × G, where G is discrete. We write elements of the space
X−ω × G as . . . x2x1 · g for xi ∈ X and g ∈ G. Two sequences . . . x2x1 · g and
. . . y2y1 · h are asymptotically equivalent if there exists a sequence gk ∈ G taking a
ﬁnite set of values such that gn · xn . . . x2x1 · g = yn . . . y2y1 · h in M⊗n for all n.
One can show that . . . x2x1 · g and . . . y2y1 · h are asymptotically equivalent if and
only if there exists an oriented path . . . e2e1 in the Moore diagram of the nucleus
such that en is labeled by xn|yn for every n and the last vertex of the path is hg−1.
The quotient of X−ω × G by the asymptotic equivalence relation is called the
limit G-space and is denoted XG. The group G acts naturally on X−ω × G by right
multiplication. This action agrees with the asymptotic equivalence relation, so that
it induces a right action of G on XG by homeomorphisms.
For every x ∈ M and . . . x2x1 · g ∈ X−ω × G the asymptotic equivalence class of
. . . x2x1 · g ⊗ x = . . . x2x1y · h, where h ∈ G and x ∈ X are such that g · x = y · h,
is uniquely determined by x and the asymptotic equivalence class of . . . x2x1 · g. It
follows that we get a well deﬁned continuous map ξ (cid:55)→ ξ ⊗ x of XG to itself.
The biset structure of M agrees with the maps ξ (cid:55)→ ξ ⊗ x on XG, so that
(ξ · g1 ⊗ x) g2 = ξ ⊗ (g1 · x · g2) for all ξ ∈ XG, g1, g2 ∈ G, x ∈ M. Moreover, we
have the following rigidity theorem, see [13, Theorem 3.4.13].
Theorem 2.1. Let M be a hyperbolic G-biset. Let X be a metric space such that
G acts on X co-compactly and properly by isometries from the right. Suppose that
for every x ∈ M we have a continuous strictly contracting map ξ (cid:55)→ ξ ⊗ x such
that (ξ · g1 ⊗ x) · g2 = ξ ⊗ (g1 · x · g2) for all ξ ∈ X , g1, g2 ∈ G, and x ∈ M.
Then there exists a homeomorphism Φ : X → XG such that Φ(ξ · g) = Φ(ξ) · g and
Φ(ξ ⊗ x) = Φ(ξ) ⊗ x for all ξ ∈ X , g ∈ G, and x ∈ M.
2.5. Contracting correspondences. Let f, ι : M1 → M0 be a topological corre-
spondence. Its limit space M∞ is subspace of all sequences (x1, x2, . . .) ∈ M∞
such
that f (xn) = ι(xn+1). For example, if ι is an identical embedding, then M∞ is the
intersection of the domains of all iterations of the partial map f .
The shift (x1, x2, . . .) (cid:55)→ (x2, x3, . . .) is a continuous self-map on M∞, which we

will denote f∞.
Deﬁnition 2.4. Let f, ι : M1 → M0 be a topological correspondence. We say that
it is contracting if M0 is a compact length metric space (i.e., there is a notion of
length of arcs such that distance between two points is the inﬁmum of lengths of
arcs connecting them), and ι is contracting with respect to the length metric on
M0 and the lift of the length metric from M0 to M1 by f .

1

In particular, if f is expanding, and ι is an identical embedding, then the corre-

spondence f, ι : M1 → M0 is contracting.

One can show that the iterated monodromy group of a contracting topological

correspondence is a contracting self-similar group, see [19].

Theorem 2.2. The limit dynamical system of a contracting topological correspon-
dence F is topologically conjugate to the limit dynamical system of the iterated
monodromy group of F.

12

VOLODYMYR NEKRASHEVYCH

The correspondence between the contracting self-similar groups and expanding
self-coverings is functorial in a precise way, see [15]. For example, any embedding of
self-similar contracting groups (preserving self-similarity) induces a semi-conjugacy
of their limit dynamical systems.

3. The Julia set of an endomorphism of PC2

3.1. The endomorphism and its iterated monodromy group. Consider the
following map on C2:

(cid:32)(cid:18) 2z

(cid:19)2

− 1

,

(cid:18) p − 1

p + 1

(cid:19)2(cid:33)

.

F (z, p) =

It can be extended to an endomorphism of PC2 given in homogeneous coordinates

by the formula

F [z : p : u] = [(2z − p − u)2 : (p − u)2 : (p + u)2].

Note that this map has no points of indeterminacy, since (2z − p− u)2 = (p− u)2 =
(p + u)2 = 0 implies p = u = z = 0. The Jacobian of the map F is

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = 32(2z − p − u)(p − u)(p + u),

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

4(2z − p − u)
−2(2z − p − u)2
2(p − u)
−2(2z − p − u) −2(p − u)

0

0

2(p + u)
2(p + u)

hence the critical locus consists of three lines 2z − p − u = 0, p = u, and p + u = 0.
Their orbits under the action of F are

{2z − p − u = 0} (cid:55)→ {z = 0} (cid:55)→ {z = u} (cid:55)→ {z = p} (cid:55)→ {z = p},

{p = −u} (cid:55)→ {u = 0} (cid:55)→ {p = u} (cid:55)→ {p = 0} (cid:55)→ {p = u}.

We see that the post-critical set of F is the union of the six lines z = 0, z = u,
z = p, p = 0, p = u, and u = 0. (Or, in aﬃne coordinates, z = 0, z = 1, z = p,
p = 0, p = 1, and the line at inﬁnity.)

The map F is a particular case of a general class of post-critically ﬁnite skew-
product maps related to the Teichm¨uller theory of post-critically ﬁnite branched
self-coverings of the sphere (Thurston maps). See [2], where the map F was (some-
what implicitly) constructed, and [9, 4] where other diﬀerent classes of similar
examples are studied.
Denote by J2 the Julia set of F , i.e., the set of points without neighborhoods
on which the sequence F ◦n is normal. Denote by J1 the support of the measure of
maximal entropy of F , which coincides with the attractor of backward iterations of
F . Both sets are completely F -invariant and we have J1 ⊂ J2, see more in [6].
Proposition 3.1. The limit dynamical system of the iterated monodromy group of
F is topologically conjugate with the action of F on J1.

(cid:16) p−1

Proof. By [13, Theorem 5.5.3] (see also Theorem 2.2 in our paper), it is enough to
construct an orbifold metric on a neighborhood of J1 with respect to which F is
expanding. Let U be an open subset of C \ {0, 1} containing the Julia set of the
and such that f−1(U ) ⊂ U . Consider the inverse
rational function f (p) =
image W of U in PC2 under the projection map (z, p) (cid:55)→ p of C2 ⊂ PC2 onto C.
Note that the lines p = 0 and p = 1 are disjoint from W , hence the intersection
points of the lines z = p, z = 0, z = 1, p = 0 and p = 1 do not belong to W .

(cid:17)2

p+1

MATING, PAPER FOLDING, AND AN ENDOMORPHISM OF PC2

Consider the orbifold with the underlying space W , where the lines z = 0, z = 1
and z = p are singular with the isotropy groups of order 2 uniformized in an atlas of
the orbifold as rotations by 180◦ in the z-planes (that are projected to the identity
map on the p-plane). The function F can be realized as a covering F : W1 → W
of a sub-orbispace W1 of W , where W1 is the orbifold with the underlying space
F −1(W ) and singular lines z = 0, z = 1, z = p, z = p + 1 of order two (also
uniformized by a rotation in the z-planes).

The orbifold W is a locally trivial bundle over the set U with hyperbolic ﬁbers
(as the fundamental group of every ﬁber is free product of three copies of the group
of order two). It follows from Proposition 3.2.2 and Theorem 3.2.15 of [8] that the
orbifold W is Kobayashi hyperbolic (i.e., that its universal covering is Kobayashi
hyperbolic). Consequently, the embedding of orbifolds ι : W1 → W is contracting
with respect to the Kobayashi metrics on W1 and W , while the map F : W1 → W
(cid:3)
is a local isometry. Theorem 2.2 ﬁnishes the proof.

An important property of the map F , greatly facilitating its study is a skew-

product structure: the second coordinate

of F (z, p) depends only on p.

On the ﬁrst coordinate we have a quadratic polynomial hp(z) = (2z/(p + 1)− 1)2
in z, depending on the parameter p. This makes it possible, in particular, to draw
the intersections of the Julia set of F with the z-lines p = p0. See Figures 8 and 9,
where some slices of the Julia set of F are shown. We will denote by J1(q) the
intersection of the Julia set J1 of F with the line p = q.

The rational function

We can interpret the complement M of the post-critical set of F as the conﬁgu-
ration space of pairs of complex numbers (z, p) which are diﬀerent from ∞, 0, 1 and
from each other. We can identify the loops α, β, γ with the loops in the conﬁgura-
tion space M coming from p staying and z traveling along the loops α, β, γ in the
line p = q0.
Let S and P be the elements of the fundamental group of M uniquely determined

by the following relations (see [18] for details)

P αP −1 =βαβ−1,
P βP −1 =βαβα−1β−1,
P γP −1 =γ,

SαS−1 =αγαγ−1α−1,
SβS−1 =β,
SγS−1 =αγα−1.

Denote also T = γS−1P −1βα. We have then:

T αT −1 =α,
T βT −1 =γβγ−1,
T γT −1 =γβγβ−1γ−1.

Proposition 3.2. The virtual endomorphism associated with F is given by

φ(α2) = 1, φ(β) = 1, φ(γ) = γ,
φ(α−1βα) = α, φ(α−1γα) = β,

φ(S2) = βαγS−1P −1, φ(T ) = P, φ(P 2) = 1.

Proof. The elements of the fundamental group of M are uniquely determined by
their action by conjugation on the normal subgroup generated by α, β and γ. Let
us use this fact (following [2] and [18]) to compute the virtual endomorphism of
π1(M) associated with the partial self-covering F .
The domain of the restriction of the virtual endomorphism onto (cid:104)α, β, γ(cid:105) (associ-
ated with the ﬁrst coordinate of the recursion (1)–(3)) is generated by α2, β, γ, α−1βα

16

and α−1γα. The action of the virtual endomorphism is given by

φ(α2) = 1, φ(β) = 1, φ(γ) = γ,
φ(α−1βα) = α, φ(α−1γα) = β.

The domain of the induced virtual endomorphism is generated by the above
generators of the domain of φ and the automorphisms S2, P 2 and T = γS−1P −1βα.
Denote τ = γ−1α−1β−1. A direct computation shows that τ commutes with S

and with P . We also have

τ−1S−1P −1αP Sτ = βγβ−1γ−1αγβγ−1β,

and

τ−1S−1P −1βP Sτ = βγβγ−1β−1,

τ−1S−1P −1γP Sτ = βγβ−1.

We have
φ(S2)αφ(S−2) = φ(S2α−1βαS−2) =

φ((αγ)2α−1(αγ)−2β(αγ)2α(αγ)−2) =

βγβ−1γ−1αγβγ−1β−1,
φ(S2)βφ(S−2) = φ(S2α−1γαS−2) = φ((αγ)2α−1γα(αγ)−2) = βγβγ−1β−1,

φ(S2)γφ(S−2) = φ(S2γS−2) = φ(αγαγα−1γ−1α−1) = βγβ−1.

We get that

φ(S2) = τ−1S−1P −1.

We have

φ(T )αφ(T −1) = φ(T α−1βαT −1) = φ(α−1γβγ−1α−1) = βαβ−1,

φ(T )βφ(T −1) = φ(T α−1γαT −1) = φ(α−1γβγβ−1γ−1α) = βαβα−1β−1,

and

φ(T )γφ(T −1) = φ(T γT −1) = φ(γβγβ−1γ−1) = γ,

which implies that φ(T ) = P .

It remains to compute φ(P 2).

φ(P 2)αφ(P −2) = φ(P 2α−1βαP −2) = φ(βαβα−1β−1) = α,

φ(P 2)βφ(P −2) = φ(P 2α−1γαP −2) =

φ(βαβα−1β−1α−1β−1γβαβαβ−1α−1β−1) = β,

φ(P 2)γφ(P −2) = φ(P 2γP −2) = φ(γ) = γ,

which implies that φ(P 2) = 1.

Theorem 3.3. The iterated monodromy group IMG (F ) is generated by the wreath
recursion

α = σ(β, β−1, βα, α−1β−1),
β = (1, βαβ−1, α, 1),
γ = (γ, β, γ, β),

P = π,
S = σπ(P −1τ−1, P −1, S−1τ−1, S−1),

MATING, PAPER FOLDING, AND AN ENDOMORPHISM OF PC2

where σ = (12)(34), π = (13)(24), and τ = γ−1α−1β−1.

Note that it follows from the recursions that the elements α, β, γ, P of the iterated

monodromy group are involutions, hence the wreath recursion can be written as

α = σ(β, β, βα, αβ),

β = (1, βαβ, α, 1),

γ = (γ, β, γ, β),

P = π,
S = σπ(P τ−1, P, S−1τ−1, S−1),

where τ = γαβ.
Note that the subgroup (cid:104)α, β, γ(cid:105) of IMG (F ) is self-similar. It is the subgroup
generated by loops of the form (cid:96)γ(cid:96)−1, where (cid:96) is a path, and γ is a loop inside the
plane p = q for some q ∈ C \ {0, 1}. We denote this subgroup G.

Proof. Denote by L0 the element [φ(1)1] of the biset Mφ. Denote then

L1 = τ · L0,

R0 = P · L0,

R1 = P τ · L0,

and order the basis of the biset associated with φ in the sequence (L0, L1, R0, R1).

We have then

α · L0 = τ · L0 · φ(τ−1α) = L1 · φ(βαγα) = L1 · β,

α · L1 = L0 · φ(ατ ) = L0 · φ(αγ−1α−1β−1) = L0 · β−1,

α · R0 = P τ · L0 · φ(τ−1P −1αP ) = L1 · φ(βαγα−1β−1αβα) = L1 · βα,

and

α · R1 = P · L0 · φ(P −1αP τ ) = R0 · φ(α−1β−1αβαγ−1α−1β−1) = R0 · α−1β−1.

Consequently,

We have

α = σ(β, β−1, βα, α−1β−1).

β · L0 = L0 · φ(β) = L0 · 1,

β · L1 = τ · L0 · φ(τ−1βτ ) = L1 · φ(βαγβγ−1α−1β−1) = L1 · βαβ−1,

β · R0 = P · L0 · φ(P −1βP ) = R0 · φ(α−1βα) = R0 · α,

and

β · R1 = P τ · L0 · φ(τ−1P −1βP τ ) = R1 · φ(βαγα−1βαγ−1α−1β−1) = R1 · 1,

hence

We have

and also

β = (1, βαβ−1, α, 1).

γ · L0 = L0 · φ(γ) = L0 · γ,

γ · L1 = τ · L0 · φ(τ−1γτ ) = L1 · φ(βαγα−1β−1) = L1 · β,

γ · R0 = R0 · γ,

γ · R1 = R1 · β,

since P commutes with γ.

Since φ(P 2) = 1 and P commutes with τ , we have

P = π.

Finally,
S · L0 = P τ · L0 · φ(τ−1P −1S) = R1 · φ(βαγ · P −2βα · α−1β−1P Sγ−1 · γ) =

R1 · φ(P −2 · βαγβα · T −1 · γ) = R1 · βαP −1γ = R1 · τ−1P −1.

Since T commutes with α, we have:

S · L1 = P · L0 · φ(P −1Sτ ) =

R0 · φ(P −2βα · α−1β−1P Sγ−1 · α−1β−1) = R0 · φ(P −2βαT −1α−1β−1) =

R0 · φ(βT −1β−1) = R0 · P −1.

Since S commutes with αγ and T commutes with α, we have:

S · R0 = τ · L0 · φ(τ−1SP ) =

L1 · φ(βαγS2γ−1 · γS−1P −1βα · α−1β−1P 2) = L1 · φ(βS2αγα−1T β−1) =

L1 · τ−1S−1P −1P = L1 · τ−1S−1,

and, since P and S commute with τ and γ commutes with P :

S · R1 = L0 · φ(SP τ ) = L0 · φ(S2γ−1 · γS−1P −1βα · α−1β−1P 2γ−1α−1β−1) =
L0 · φ(S2γ−1T α−1β−1γ−1α−1β−1P 2) = L0 · τ−1S−1P −1γ−1P α−1β−1 =

L0 · τ−1S−1τ = L0 · S−1,

which implies that

S = σπ(P −1τ−1, P −1, S−1τ−1, S−1),

which ﬁnishes the proof.

Recall that by G we denote the subgroup of IMG (F ) generated by α, β, γ. We
will see below that it is equivalent as a self-similar group to the subgroup of G
generated by α, β, γ.

Proposition 3.4. The group IMG (F ) is isomorphic (as a self-similar group) to an
index two subgroup of the group G. The isomorphism maps α, β, γ to the correspond-
ing generators of G and maps S and P to acαγ and βba, respectively. The bisets of
the wreath recursions for IMG (F ) (as in Theorem 3.3) and G (as in Deﬁnition 3.1)
are identiﬁed with each other using the equalities

{L0 = e00,

L1 = e01 · β,

R0 = e10 · a,

R1 = e11 · βαa}.

Proof. Recall, that the group G is generated by

α = σ,

β = (1, α, α, 1),

γ = (γ, β, γ, β),

a = π,

b = (a, a, αa, αa),

c = (βb, βb, γc, γc).

We have

βa = αβα,

γb = βγβ,

βc = γβγ,

and a, b, c commute with the remaining generators α, β, γ.

Conjugating the right hand side of the recursion by (1, β, a, βαa), we get

α = σ(β, β, aαβa, aβαa) = σ(β, β, βα, αβ),

β = (1, βαβ, aαa, 1) = (1, βαβ, α, 1),

γ = (γ, β, aγa, aαβαa) = (γ, β, γ, β),

a = π(a, αa, a, αa),

b = (a, βaβ, aαaa, aαβαaβαa) = (a, βαβαa, αa, αa),

c = (βb, ββbβ, aγca, aαβγcβαa) = (βb, βb, γaca, αγαaca).

Let us show that S = acαγ, and P = βba satisfy the wreath recursion of Propo-

sition 3.4.

We have, using commutation of the involutions a and α:

βba = π(aαaαaa, αaαa, aa, βαββαβαaαa) = π,

which agrees with the condition P = π.

g ∈ G and for every eij we have g · eij = eik · h for some h ∈ G and k ∈ {0, 1}. In
other words, the self-similarity biset of G is a disjoint union (“direct sum”) of the
bisets M0 = {e00, e01} · G and M1 = {e10, e11} · G.
Let us denote Ei = {ei0, ei1} for i ∈ {0, 1}. We will also denote E∅ = {∅} and

Ei1i2...in = Ei1Ei2 . . . Ein ⊂ {e00, e01, e10, e11}n.

Then for every sequence w = i1i2 . . .{0, 1}ω the subtree

of the tree T = {e00, e01, e10, e11}∗ is invariant under the action of the group G.

Denote by Gw the restriction of the action of G onto the subtree Tw, seen as an
automorphism group of the binary tree.
Then it follows directly from the wreath recursion for G that the group Gw is
generated by automorphisms αw, βw, γw (images of α, β, γ) which are deﬁned by
the following recursions.

quotient of the free group (cid:104)α, β, γ | ∅(cid:105) by the normal subgroup R =(cid:84)

The group G is the universal group of the family {Gw : w ∈ {0, 1}ω}, i.e., G is the
w∈{0,1}ω Rw,
where Rw is the kernel of the natural epimorphism α (cid:55)→ αw, β (cid:55)→ βw, γ (cid:55)→ γw of
the free group (cid:104)α, β, γ | ∅(cid:105) onto the group Gw. This follows from the fact that the
subtrees Tw cover the tree T .
Proposition 3.5. The group G is contracting with the nucleus N = {1, α, β, γ}.
Proof. By [13, Lemma 2.11.2] we have to show that sections of N · {α, β, γ} even-
tually belong to N . But sections of the elements α, β in words of length more
than one are trivial, while γ is of order two. Hence, sections of the elements of
N · {α, β, γ} in words of length two belong to N .
(cid:3)

The following proposition is a direct corollary of the wreath recursion deﬁning

the groups G and K.
Proposition 3.6. Denote by K the self-similar group generated by

where σ is the transposition. The map g (cid:55)→(cid:101)g from G to K deﬁned by

(cid:101)b = ((cid:101)a,(cid:101)a),
b (cid:55)→(cid:101)b,

(cid:101)c = ((cid:101)b,(cid:101)c),
c (cid:55)→(cid:101)c

and g (cid:55)→ 1 for g ∈ G extends to an epimorphism G → K. Together with the map
eij (cid:55)→ j it generates an epimorphism of bisets.
The image of the subtree Tw under the action of an element h ∈ G is the subtree
T(cid:101)h(w).

(cid:101)a = σ, (cid:101)b = ((cid:101)a,(cid:101)a),

(cid:101)c = ((cid:101)b,(cid:101)c)

Proposition 3.7. For any element g of the kernel of the epimorphism G → K
there exists n such that g|v ∈ G for all words v of length greater than n.
Proof. It is easy to check that the wreath recursion

is contracting on the group given by the presentation (cid:101)K = (cid:104)(cid:101)a,(cid:101)b,(cid:101)c | ((cid:101)a)2 = ((cid:101)b)2 =
((cid:101)c)2 = 1(cid:105) with the nucleus {1,(cid:101)a,(cid:101)b,(cid:101)c}.
It follows from [13, Proposition 2.13.2] that a product(cid:101)g of the generators(cid:101)a,(cid:101)b,(cid:101)c is
trivial in K if and only if there exists n such that(cid:101)g belongs to the kernel of the nth
iterate of the wreath recursion on (cid:101)K. Let g be a product of the generators of K and
let(cid:101)g be the word obtained from g by removing all generators α, β, γ and applying
the homomorphism h (cid:55)→ (cid:101)h to every letter a, b, c. Then the word (cid:101)g represents a
trivial element of K. Let n by such that(cid:101)g belongs to the kernel of the nth iterate
of the wreath recursion on (cid:101)K. Then it follows from the wreath recursion deﬁning

G and normality of G in G that the sections of g in all words of length v belong to
G.
(cid:3)

It follows directly from the interpretation of the generators S and P of IMG (F )
that the image of the subgroup IMG (F ) < G in the quotient K is isomorphic the

The corresponding epimorphism of the self-similarity bisets acts by the rule Li (cid:55)→ L
and Ri (cid:55)→ R, where (L, R) is the ordered basis associated with the above recursion
for IMG (f ).
Proposition 3.8. The transformation κ of the space {L, R}−ω changing in every
sequence w ∈ {L, R}−ω each letter L to R and vice versa induces a homeomorphism
of the limit space of IMG (f ), corresponding to the complex conjugation on the Julia
set of f .

Proof. Let us compute the iterated monodromy group IMG (f ) directly, in order
to understand the geometric meaning of the elements L and R.
The post-critical set of f is {∞, 0, 1}. Take −1 as the basepoint. Let S and
P be the loops going in the positive direction around 0 and around both 0 and 1,
respectively, as it is shown on the top part of Figure 10. Connect the basepoint 1
with its preimages ±i by straight segments.

The bottom part of Figure 10 shows the inverse images of the generators under
the action of the rational function. We see that if we label the path connecting the
basepoint −1 to i by (cid:96)R and the path connecting −1 to −i by (cid:96)L, then the associated
biset is deﬁned by

P · L = R, P · R = L,

and

S · R = L · P, S · L = R · S−1,

which agrees with the wreath recursion (12).
Recall that a sequence . . . X (1)X (0) ∈ {L, R}−ω represents the point of the Julia
set equal to the limit of the path (cid:96)0(cid:96)1 ··· , where (cid:96)k is a continuation of the path

has real coeﬃcients, the basepoint −1 is real,
Since the rational function
and complex conjugation permutes the paths (cid:96)R and (cid:96)L, the transformation κ maps a
sequence corresponding to a point z to the sequence corresponding to the conjugate
(cid:3)
point z.

Recall that J1(q) denotes the intersection of the Julia set J1 with the z-line

p = q.
Proposition 3.9. Each connected component of the limit space JG of the group
G consists of points represented by the sequences of the form . . . X (2)
, where
w = . . . X (2)X (1) ∈ {R, L}−ω is ﬁxed and ik ∈ {0, 1} are arbitrary. The connected
component corresponding to w ∈ {R, L}−ω is homeomorphic J1(p0), where p0 is the
point of the Julia set of f encoded by the sequence w.
Proof. Since G is a self-similar subgroup of IMG (F ), the equivalence relation as-
sociated with G is a sub-relation of the asymptotic equivalence relation associ-
ated with IMG (F ). The group G changes only the indices of the symbols X (k)
,
hence G-equivalent sequences are of the form . . . X (2)
for some
ik, jk ∈ {0, 1} and X (k) ∈ {L, R}. Since G is level-transitive on each of the subtrees,
the image of the set {. . . X (2)
. . . i2i1 ∈ {0, 1}−ω} in the limit space of
G is connected (by the argument similar to that of [13, Section 3.5]), hence is a
connected component.

It remains to show that the equivalence relation associated with IMG (F ) re-
. . . i2i1 ∈ {0, 1}−ω} coincides with the restriction
stricted to the set {. . . X (2)
of the equivalence associated with G, i.e., that the group IMG (F ) does not intro-
duce new identiﬁcations inside the connected components of the limit space of G.
Suppose that the sequences . . . X (2)
are equivalent with respect
i2
to the action of IMG (F ). It means that there exists a sequence gk of elements of
IMG (F ) assuming a ﬁnite set of values and such that gk · X (k)
· gk−1 for
all k ≥ 1. The limit space of IMG (f ) has no singular points, since the rational
is hyperbolic. It follows that the images of gk in K are
function f (p) =
trivial. But this implies, by Proposition 3.7 that the elements gk belong to G, i.e.,
that the sequences are equivalent with respect to the action of the group G.
(cid:3)
3.4. The Schreier graphs of the groups Gw. Recall that for v = i1i2 . . . in ∈
{0, 1}n, we denoted by Ev the set of words of the form ei1j1 ei2j2 . . . einjn , where
j1j2 . . . jn ∈ {0, 1}n. We will denote the word ei1j1 ei2j2 . . . einjn just j1j2 . . . jn, for
simplicity of notation. This notation agrees with the interpretation of Ev as the
nth level of the tree on which the group Gw acts.
Let v ∈ {0, 1}∗. Denote by Γv the Schreier graph of the action of G on the set
Ev, i.e., the graph with the set of vertices Ev in which to elements w1, w2 ∈ Xv
are adjacent if and only if g(w1) = w2 for some g ∈ {α, β, γ}. We label the
corresponding edge of Γv by g.
Note that the graph Γv is the Schreier graph of the action of the group Gw on
the nth level of the tree, where w is any inﬁnite word starting with v, and n is the
length of v.
Note that for every generator g ∈ {α, β, γ} of G there exists a unique word
zg,v ∈ Ev of length n and a generator h ∈ {α, β, γ} such that h|zg,v = g. For the
remaining pairs h ∈ {α, β, γ} and u ∈ Ev we have h|u = 1.

Namely, we have, for v ∈ {0, 1}n:

(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)

zα,v = 00 . . . 0
n − 2 times

(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)

zγ,v = 00 . . . 0

where x(cid:48) = 1 − x is the letter diﬀerent from the last letter x of v. If the word v has
length less than 2, one has to take the endings of length |v| in the right hand sides
of the equalities.
Proposition 3.10. Let v, u ∈ {0, 1}∗ be arbitrary ﬁnite words. Consider for each
word w ∈ {0, 1}|v| a copy Γu,w of the edge-labeled graph Γu. Connect, for each
g ∈ {α, β, γ} and w ∈ {0, 1}|v| the copy of zg,u in Γu,w with the copy of zg,u in
Γu,g(w) by an edge labeled by the element h ∈ {α, β, γ} such that h|zg,u = g. The
obtained graph is isomorphic to Γuv.
In this graph the vertex zg,uv is the copy of zh,u in Γu,w for h ∈ {α, β, γ} and
w ∈ {0, 1}|v| such that h|w = g.

Note that the copies Γu,w of Γu are connected in Γuv in the same way as the

vertices w are connected in the graph Γv.
Proof. Let w1w2 ∈ Xuv and |w1| = |u|,|w2| = |v|. It follows from the deﬁnition of
the words zα,u, zβ,u, zγ,u that a generator g ∈ {α, β, γ} changes the end of length
|w2| in the word w1w2 only when w1 = zh,u for some h ∈ {α, β, γ}, and then we have
g(w1w2) = w1h(w2). In all the other cases g(w1w2) = g(w1)w2, since g|w1 = 1. (cid:3)

In the case |v| = 1 we get the following inductive rule of constructing the graphs

Γu.

Corollary 3.11. In order to get Γux one has to take two copies Γ(0)
u of
Γu and connect by an edge the copies of the vertices zα,u. The obtained graph is
Γux. The vertex zα,ux is the copy of zβ,u in Γ(1−x)
. The vertex zβ,ux is the copy of
zγ,u in Γ(1)

u . The vertex zγ,ux is the copy of zγ,u in Γ(0)
u .

u and Γ(1)

u

In the opposite case (when |u| = 1) we get the following rule.

Corollary 3.12. In order to get Γxv one has to replace in Γv each vertex w by a
pair of vertices 0w and 1w, connected by an edge (labeled by α), connect (1 − x)w
to (1 − x)α(w) by an edge (labeled by β), connect 0w to 0γ(w) and 1w to 1β(w) by
edges labeled by γ.

We get nice pictures of the graphs Γv when we draw the edges labeled by α, β,
and γ in such a way that they have equal length and for every vertex w the edge
labeled by β incident with w (if it exists) is obtained from the edge labeled by α
by rotation by π/2 around w, while the edge labeled by γ is obtained from the
edge labeled by α by rotation by −π/2. We can also use the opposite agreement
(changing the signs of π/2 and −π/2). See, for instance, Figure 11, where some
graphs Γv are constructed in this way. Figure 12 shows diﬀerent graphs Γv for
|v| = 6.

Figure 11. Graphs Γv

The rule from Corollary 3.12 is shown then on Figure 13. Note that in the
transition from Γv to Γ1v the relative position of the edges labeled by α (connecting
0w with 1w), β (connecting 0w with 0α(w)) and γ (connecting 0w with 0γ(w) and
1w with 1β(w)) is inverted. This can be corrected by taking mirror image of Γ1v.
The inductive rule, shown on Figure 13 can be used to prove many properties of

the graphs Γv, but we will use a more uniﬁed approach later.

3.5. External angles. The group generated by the binary adding machine (odome-
ter) τ = σ(1, τ ) is the iterated monodromy group of the polynomial z2. For every
quadratic polynomial h(z) the loop around inﬁnity generates a self-similar cyclic
subgroup of IMG (h) equivalent as a self-similar group to the group generated by

26

the adding machine. The obtained embedding IMG(cid:0)z2(cid:1) → IMG (h) induces a sur-

VOLODYMYR NEKRASHEVYCH

jection from the circle (the Julia set of z2) onto the Julia set of h, which agrees
with the dynamics (i.e., is a semiconjugacy). This semiconjugacy coincides with
the classical Caratheodory loop, see [11], i.e., to the extension to the boundary of
the biholomorphic conjugacy from the action of z2 on the complement of the unit
disc to the action of h on the complement of its ﬁlled Julia set (i.e., of the set of
points that have bounded h-orbits).
By analogy with the Caratheodory loop, let us consider the subgroup R =
(cid:104)P, S, τ(cid:105) < IMG (F ) and the semiconjugacy of the corresponding limit spaces.
The generators of the subgroup R are given by the wreath recursion

P = π,
S = πσ(P τ−1, P, S−1τ−1, S−1),
τ = σ(1, τ, 1, τ ).

Proposition 3.13. The nucleus of the group R = (cid:104)P, S, τ(cid:105) is the set

N = {1, S, S−1, P, τ, τ−1, Sτ, S−1τ−1, P τ, P τ−1}.

Proof. It follows directly from the recursion (and the fact that τ commutes with P
and S) that N is a symmetric state-closed set (a subset A of a self-similar group
is called state-closed if for every g ∈ A and x ∈ X we have g|x ∈ A). We have to
prove that the sections of the elements

{S, S−1, τ, τ−1, Sτ, S−1τ−1} · {S, τ}

eventually belong to N (sections of P are trivial in non-empty words, so we do not
have to consider it). But this follows from the equalities

S2 = (P S−1τ−1, P S−1τ−1, S−1P τ, S−1P τ ),

Sτ−1 = π(P τ−1, P τ−1, S−1τ−1, S−1τ−1),
S2τ = σ(P S−1τ−1, P S−1, S−1P τ, S−1P ),
τ 2 = (τ, τ, τ, τ ),
Sτ 2 = πσ(P, P τ, S−1, S−1τ ).

Proof. Note that the wreath recursion for τ and P is written in terms of the self-
similarity biset as

τ · X0 = X1,

τ · X1 = X0 · τ,

P · Ri = Li, P · Li = Ri,

where X is one of the symbols L, R and i is one of the symbols 0, 1.

Note also that τ S = π(P, P, S−1, S−1), hence

S · Li = τ−1 · Ri · P, S · Ri = τ−1 · Li · S−1,

28

VOLODYMYR NEKRASHEVYCH

which implies

S−1 · Li = τ · Ri · S, S−1 · Ri = τ · Li · P,

since S and τ commute.

Examining the nucleus of the group on Figure 14, we see that left-inﬁnite (inﬁnite
in the past) paths labeled by (w1, w2) in its Moore diagram belong to one of the
following types:
(I) The path travels inside the set {1, τ, τ−1}. In this case the we have p(w1) =
p(w2) and θ(w1) = θ(w2), and every pair (w1, w2) satisfying these two equalities
can be obtained in this way.

(II) Its vertices alternatively belongs to the sets {S, Sτ} and {S−1, S−1τ−1}.
If the last vertex of the path belongs to {S, Sτ}, then p(w1) = (RL)−ω and
p(w2) = (LR)−ω. If the last vertex belongs to {S−1, S−1τ−1}, then p(w1) = (LR)−ω
and p(w2) = (RL)−ω, which is symmetric with the ﬁrst case.
(III) The last vertex of the path belongs to {P, P τ, P τ−1}. Then either p(w1) =
(RL)−ωL and p(w2) = (LR)−ωR (if the previous vertex belongs to {S, Sτ}), or
p(w1) = (LR)−ωR and p(w2) = (RL)−ωL (otherwise).
(IV) One of the vertices of the path (but not the last one) belong to {P, P τ, P τ−1}.
Then p(w1) = (RL)−ωLv and p(w2) = (LR)−ωRv(cid:48), or p(w1) = (LR)−ωRv and p(w2) =
(RL)−ωLv(cid:48), where v(cid:48) is obtained from v by changing the ﬁrst letter.

In the ﬁrst case of (II), if w1 = . . . Ri4 Li3 Ri2 Li1 and w2 = . . . Lj4 Rj3 Lj2 Rj1, then

In all cases, as n → ∞ we get

θ(w2) = θ(w1) + 1/2 − 1/4 + 1/8 − 1/16 + ··· = θ(w1) + 1/3

(mod 1),

i.e., θ(w1) = θ(w2) + 2/3.

In the ﬁrst case of (III) we have w1 = . . . Ri5 Li4 Ri3 Li2 Li1, and w2 = . . . Lj5 Rj4 Lj3 Rj2 Rj1 ,

and we have

which implies

θ(w2) = θ(w1) − 1/2 + 1/4 − 1/8 + ··· = θ(w1) − 1/3

(mod 1),

Consider now case (IV). We have w1 = . . . Ri5 Li4 Ri3 Li2 Li1u and w2 = . . . Lj5 Rj4 Lj3 Ri2 Ri1u(cid:48)

which proves case (III) of the proposition.
for some u, u(cid:48) ∈ {L0, L1, R0, R1}∗, and for every n we have

Recall that the iterated monodromy group IMG (f ) of f (p) =

is the
image of the group G = (cid:104)α, β, γ, R, S(cid:105) under the natural epimorphism G → K of
self-similar groups described in Proposition 3.6. Note that the image of the group
R under this epimorphism is also IMG (f ). The asymptotic equivalence relation
deﬁned by IMG (f ) is generated by the identiﬁcations

p+1

(RL)−ω ∼ (LR)−ω,

(RL)−ωLv ∼ (LR)−ωRv(cid:48),

where v ∈ {L, R}∗ is arbitrary and v(cid:48) is obtained from v by changing the ﬁrst letter.
This follows also from Proposition 3.14 just by ignoring the indices, i.e., the map
θ.
The natural projection p : {L0, L1, R0, R1}−ω → {L, R}−ω agrees with the equiva-
lence relations deﬁned by the group R and its quotient IMG (f ), so that p induces

a surjective continuous map(cid:101)p : JR → JIMG(f ) of the limit spaces. The ﬁbers of the
map (cid:101)p are circles by Proposition 3.14. It follows that the limit space of R can be

interpreted as the bundle over the Julia set of f of the Caratheodory loops around
the p-slices J1(p) of the Julia set of F .

Let us describe the limit space of the group IMG (f ) following [13, Section 3.10].
As the zero step approximation of the tile of the group take a rectangle. The
vertices of the rectangle (which will correspond to the boundary points of the tile)
are labeled by the sequences (RL)−ωL, (LR)−ωR, (LR)−ω, (RL)−ω in the given cyclic
order counterclockwise. Hence, the zero step approximation of the limit space will
be the rectangle with two pairs of vertices identiﬁed.
In order to get the next
approximation of the tile one has to take two copies of the previous approximation,
append R to end of the labels of one of them and append L to the labels of the
other. After that one has to identify the point labeled by (LR)−ωRR with the point
labeled by (RL)−ωLL and the point labeled by (LR)−ωRL with the point labeled by
(RL)−ωLR.

See the sixth approximation of the tile on the middle picture of Figure 15. The
two pairs of the boundary points of the tile, which are identiﬁed in the limit space,
are drawn close to each other, so that we get a picture approximating the limit

vertices of 64 rectangles made in the process of construction the approximation of
the limit space. Compare the obtained pictures with the Julia set of the rational
function u (cid:55)→ u2+1

function is conjugate to f : p (cid:55)→(cid:16) 1−p

If we apply just the identiﬁcations (1) of Proposition 3.14 to the space {L0, L1, R0, R1}−ω,

i.e., if we consider the limit space of (cid:104)τ(cid:105), then we will get the direct product of the
Cantor set {L, R}−ω with the circle R/Z.
Figure 16 shows the remaining identiﬁcations producing the limits space of R.
The arrows show which sequences w ∈ {L, R}−ω are identiﬁed, while the labels are
the rotations applied to the corresponding circles. Namely, if we have an arrow
from w1 to w2 labeled by θ0, then each point θ of the circle above w1 is identiﬁed
with the point θ + θ0 of the circle above w2. The limit dynamical system acts on
the Julia set of f as f (equivalently, as the shift on {L, R}−ω), and on the circles as
the map θ (cid:55)→ 2θ. Note that the identiﬁcations described by Proposition 3.14 and
Figure 16 are such that the resulting map on the limit space of R is well deﬁned.

The embedding R < IMG (F ) induces a semiconjugacy of the limit spaces

Φ : JR → JIMG(F ) = J1.

We call points of JR external rays. We say that an external ray ζ ∈ JR lands on
(z, p) ∈ J1 if Φ(ζ) = (z, p). Points of JR are encoded by pairs (θ, w), where θ ∈ R/Z
and w ∈ {L, R}−ω is a sequence representing a point p ∈ J1. The coordinate θ is
called the angle of the external ray. Note that angle of an external ray may be not
uniquely deﬁned, since a point of the Julia set of f may be represented by diﬀerent
sequences. On the other hand, diﬀerence between angles of two external rays above
the same point of the Julia set of f is well deﬁned, since two circles are pasted to
each other (in Proposition 3.14) using a rotation.
Proposition 3.15. Denote by q1 the ﬁxed point ≈ 0.2956 of f (p) =

(cid:17)2
. If
n≥0 f−n(q1) of q1, then there are two external
rays landing on (p0, p0). The diﬀerence of angles of these external rays is equal to
2k−13 , where k is the smallest integer such that f k(p0) = q1. In all the other cases
there is a unique ray landing on (p0, p0).

p0 belongs to the backward orbit (cid:83)

(cid:16) 1−p

Recall that the line z = p is contained in J1 and is an F -invariant subset of the

post-critical locus of F .

Proof. It follows from the description of the asymptotic equivalence relation of the
group IMG (f ) that the ﬁxed points of f are encoded in the limit space by the
sequences R−ω, L−ω and (RL)−ω ∼ (LR)−ω. The transformation κ permutes the ﬁrst
two sequences and ﬁxes the last one. Since κ corresponds to complex conjugation
(see Proposition 3.8), we conclude that the real ﬁxed point of f is encoded by the
sequences (RL)−ω ∼ (LR)−ω. Hence, the points of the backward orbit of q1 are the
points encoded by the sequences of the form (RL)−ωv, for v ∈ {R, L}∗.
It follows from the dynamics on the post-critical set of F that the points of the
line z = p are singular with the isotropy group a conjugate of (cid:104)γ(cid:105). The wreath recur-
sion in Theorem 3.3 implies that the points encoded by the sequences . . . X (2)
0 X (1)
for X (k) ∈ {L, R} have isotropy group (cid:104)γ(cid:105), hence these sequences encode the points
z = p0, where p0 is encoded by . . . X (2)X (1) in the limit space of IMG (f ).

Removing all the other arrows and removing all arrows which do not belong to any

The last identiﬁcation is trivial in terms of external angles.

It follows that the point z = p0 is a landing point of one external ray to the slice
p = p0 of the Julia set of F except when p0 is in the backward orbit of the ﬁxed
point q1, when it is a landing point of exactly two external rays.
(cid:3)

The remaining statements follow from Proposition 3.14.

Note that the points of the backward orbit of q1 are precisely the points where
diﬀerent Fatou components of f touch each other, i.e., the points belonging to
boundaries of two Fatou components of f . This follows from the fact that the ﬁxed
point q1 belongs to the boundaries of the Fatou components containing 0 and 1,
and that every Fatou component of f is mapped by some iterations of f onto the
Fatou components containing 0 and 1.

See Figure 18, where the external rays to the point (q1, q1) are shown.

α1 = σ(β1, β1, β1α1, α1β1),
β1 = (1, β1α1β1, α1, 1),

Let us conjugate the right hand side of the recursion deﬁning α1, β1, γ1 by π =

which implies that γ1α1β1 = γ2α2β2 = τ .

Denote by (cid:98)G the group generated by the set G1 ∪ G2.

γ2α2β2 = σ(1, γ2α2β2, 1, γ2α2β2),

Here {i, j} = {0, 1} and B = β1β2, C = γ1γ2.

For the deﬁnition of J1(p) see the remark before Proposition 3.9.

Proposition 4.2. The connected components of the limit space of the group (cid:98)G are

obtained by taking the slices J1(p) and J1(p) of the Julia set of F and gluing one
to the other along the Caratheodory loop, where the external ray landing on (p, p)
is identiﬁed with the external ray landing on (p, p). If there are two external rays
landing on (p, p) (i.e., when p belongs to the grand orbit of the real ﬁxed point q1
of f ), then the Caratheodory loops are aligned in such a way that only one external
ray landing on (p, p) is identiﬁed with the external ray landing on (p, p).

34

Equivalently, the connected components of the limit space of (cid:98)G are obtained by

VOLODYMYR NEKRASHEVYCH

taking two copies of J1(p), and gluing the Caratheodory loop around one copy of
J1(p) to its mirror reﬂection along the diameter containing a ray landing on (p, p).
The image of the Caratheodory loop will be a curve going through every point
of the pillowcase C/H induced by the embedding (cid:104)τ(cid:105) < IMG (F ).

Proof. It follows from Propositions 3.9 and 3.8 that the connected components of

the limit space of (cid:98)G are obtained by gluing together the slice J1(p) of the Julia set of

F with the slice J1(p). Since γ1α1β1 = γ2α2β2 = τ , the Caratheodory loop around
J1(p) is identiﬁed with the Caratheodory loop around J1(p) by the map induced
by the map . . . X (2)
on the corresponding sets of sequences.

Classically (see [11]) the identiﬁcations described in Proposition 4.2 are called
“matings”. The only diﬀerence is that in the case of the classical mating the
polynomials are monic, and the corresponding Caratheodory loops are reﬂected
with respect to the real axis (which corresponds to the angle 0 external ray of a
special ﬁxed point of the polynomial). In our case we reﬂect the Caratheodory loop
with respect to the diameter containing a ray landing on the points of the invariant
line (p, p). Since there can be two rays landing on (p, p), there are two possible
“rotated matings”.

As particular cases of components described in Proposition 4.2 we get the mating

Then the G1-biset {ˆL0, ˆL1, ˆR0, ˆR1}·G1 is naturally isomorphic to the self-similarity

Let us identify G1 and G2 with G in a natural way, so that Li and Ri become

Let a = π(a, aα, a, αa), which is the element a = π of G written with respect to

The orbispace C/H is a ﬂat surface homeomorphic to the sphere with four sin-
gular points, which are the images of the ﬁxed points 1/2, (1 + i)/2, 0, and i/2 of
the transformations A, B, C and CAB, respectively. Let us denote these singular
points by ZA, ZB, ZC and ZCAB, respectively. A fundamental domain D of H is
the rectangle with the vertices i/2, 0, 1 and 1 + i/2.
The natural map D → C/H folds this rectangle along the segment connecting
1/2 and (1+i)/2 in two, so that we get a “pillowcase”, whose vertices are the points

form z (cid:55)→ ±z + q, where q ∈ Z[i] is a Gaussian integer divisible by (1 + i)n.
It follows then from Proposition 4.4, that the Schreier graph of the action of H
on the nth level of the tree consists of 2n copies of the graph Γn(H) := ΓH/Hn. A
fundamental domain of Hn is the rectangle with vertices 0, (1 + i)n, i(1 + i)n/2, and
(1 + i/2)(1 + i)n. Note that its sides are either parallel to the real and imaginary
axis (for even n) or parallel to the diagonals (cid:60)(z) = (cid:61)(z) and (cid:60)(z) = −(cid:61)(z).
See Figure 21 for the Schreier graphs Γ5(H) and Γ4(H). Note that they have
four loops, which we will usually omit in the sequel, since we will consider simplicial
Schreier graphs only.
Figure 22 shows a more convenient way of drawing the Schreier graphs Γn(H) and
their subgraphs. Here the graphs Γ5(H) and Γ4(H) are drawn inside fundamental
domains of the action of Hn on C. In order to get the Schreier graphs one has to
fold the rectangle into a square pillowcase (which corresponds to taking the quotient
C/Hn).
Denote for v = X (1)X (2) . . . X (n) ∈ {L, R}n by Γ1,v and Γ2,v the corresponding
connected components of the Schreier graphs of the actions of G1 and G2 on the
nth level of the tree. More precisely, they are the Schreier graphs of the actions of

The graphs Γ1,v and Γ2,v are isomorphic to the Schreier graphs Γw1 and Γw2 of
the group G, where w1, w2 ∈ {0, 1}∗ are determined by the rules given in Proposi-
tion 4.3. Note that w2 is obtained from w1 by changing the ﬁrst letter.
By Lemma 4.1, the graphs Γ1,v and Γ2,v have disjoint sets of edges such that their
union is the set of edges of Γn(H) (if we ignore the loops). Namely, the red edges
of Figure 20 correspond to α1, the orange ones to α2; each blue edge corresponds
either to β1 or to β2, each green edge either to γ1 or to γ2.

See Figure 23 for an example of the subgraphs Γ1,v and Γ2,v (colored red and

Note that each edge of ΓH is a diagonal of a square with sides of length 1/2
parallel to the real and imaginary axes. These squares tile the plane and the
pillowcases C/Hn and each square of the tiling has precisely one diagonal belonging
to the Cayley graph ΓH. By coloring the squares containing the edges of Γ1,v and
Γ2,v in diﬀerent colors (e.g., black and white), we get a nice visualization of the
partition of Γn(H) into the trees Γ1,v and Γ2,v, see Figure 24. Here the squares
whose diagonals are loops of Γn(H) are colored blue. We will call them singular.

Figure 23. A component of a Schreier graph of (cid:98)G

Let us denote by K1,v the union of the squares whose diagonals belong to Γ1,v
and by K2,v the union of the squares whose diagonals belong to Γ2,v and of the
singular squares.

Figure 24. Partition into sets Ki,v

Proposition 4.7. Boundary between K1,v and K2,v is a closed broken line λv
describing the action of τ on the vertex set of Γn(H). Namely, for every vertex u
there are no vertices of Γn(H) on λv between u and τ (u).

Note that our choice to include the singular squares in K2,v is not very important.
It will change only the side on which the path λv goes around the singular point of
C/Hn.
Proof. We have τ = γ1α1β1 = γ2α2β2. Consider the little squares of Γn(H). Two
of their sides (opposite to each other) correspond to α1 = CAB and α2 = A, the
other two sides correspond to B and C. Each of the latter two edges may belong
either to Γ1,v or to Γ2,v. Figure 25 shows all four possible cases. Note that if an
edge corresponding to B or C belongs to Γi,v, then its endpoints are ﬁxed under the
action of β1−i, γ1−i, respectively. This information makes it possible to determine
for one of the pairs of vertices of the square that one is the image of the other under
the action of τ , as it is shown by black arrows on Figure 25. If one of the edges of
the squares is a loop of Γn(H), then we assume that it belongs to Γ2,v (according to
our convention about the set K2,v). Note that diﬀerent agreement does not change
the order in which λv connects the vertices of Γn(H).

Figure 25. Action of τ

between the sets K1,v and K2,v.

We see that the arrows describing the action of τ belong to the boundary λv
(cid:3)
Consequently, partition of the pillowcase C/Hn into the sets K1,v and K2,v is
an approximation of the mating described in Proposition 4.2. The boundary λv
between the sets converges (as v converges to a left-inﬁnite sequence w ∈ {L, R}−ω)
to the map from the circle to a connected component of J(cid:98)G induced by the inclusion
of (cid:104)τ(cid:105) < (cid:98)G.

See Figure 26, where two examples of the partition are given.

Figure 26. “Pillowcase ornaments”

We orient λv according to the action of τ , so that oriented segments go from u
to τ (u). Then λv goes around Γ1,v in positive direction, and around Γ2,v in the
negative direction (if we orient C in the standard way), see Figure 25.

4.6. Recursive rule of constructing Γ1,v and Γ2,v. It follows from Proposi-
tion 4.3 that the graphs Γ1,v and Γ2,v for w = z1z2 . . . zn ∈ {L, R}n are isomorphic
to the Schreier graphs Γw1 and Γw2 of G, where w1 = x1x2 . . . xn, w2 = y1y2 . . . yn ∈

Let us translate now the recursive rule from Corollary 3.11 of construction of
the graphs Γv in terms of the sequences over the alphabet {L, R} and subgraphs of
the graph ΓH.
Note that since the graphs Γi,v are trees (as they are isomorphic to Γw for some
w), they can be lifted by the natural quotient map ΓH → ΓH/Hn to a subgraph of
the Cayley graph ΓH of H.

On the initial step (for the empty word v) the graphs Γi,∅ consist of one vertex
only, which is marked by zα,∅, zβ,∅, and zγ,∅ simultaneously. Choose a point in ΓH,
which will be the lift of the graphs Γ∅,i. We will add, for convenience, halves of the
incident edges of ΓH, corresponding to CAB, B, C for Γ1,∅ and A, B, C for Γ2,∅.
Let us denote the obtained graphs by ∆1,∅ and ∆2,∅, respectively.

Suppose that we have constructed the graphs ∆1,v and ∆2,v, which are lifts of
the graphs Γ1,v and Γ2,v, respectively, with three marked vertices zα,v, zβ,v, and
zγ,v and halves of some edges of ΓH attached to the marked vertices. Let z(cid:48)
β,v,
and z(cid:48)
Then the graphs ∆i,vx for i ∈ {1, 2}, x ∈ {L, R} together with the marking are

γ,v be the other (“hanging”) vertices of the half-edges.

obtained by the following rule.

Denote ∆i,v,0 = ∆i,v and let ∆i,v,1 be ∆i,v rotated by 180◦ around z(cid:48)

α,v. Take
the union of ∆i,v,0 with the ∆i,v,1, connecting in this way the respective copies of
zα,v by an edge.
The copy of zγ,v in ∆i,v,0 is the vertex zγ,vx. The copy of zγ,v in ∆i,v,1 is the
vertex zβ,vx. If the last letter of v coincides with x (or if v = ∅, x = L, i = 1,
or v = ∅, x = R, i = 2), then the copy of zβ,v in ∆i,v,1 is zα,vx, otherwise zα,vx is
the copy of zβ,v in ∆i,v,0. Remove the half-edge attached to the other (unmarked)
copy of zβ,v. The obtained graph is ∆i,vx. The graph Γi,vx is obtained from it by
removing the three half-edges attached to the marked vertices.

See the ﬁrst three steps of this recursion (for i = 1) on Figure 27.
Note that it follows directly from the construction, that the points z(cid:48)
β,v and
β,vz(cid:48)
γ,v are vertices of a right isosceles triangle. Orientation of the triangles z(cid:48)
z(cid:48)

R.

5. Paper-folding curves

5.1. Mazes associated with graphs Γ1,v. Consider again the Cayley graph H
drawn in C, as on Figure 20. Consider the half-integral grid on C, i.e., the tiling
of the plane by the parallel translations by the elements of Z[i]/2 of the square
with the vertices 0, 1/2, i/2, and 1/2 + i/2. The group H acts freely on the set of
these squares with two orbits (corresponding to the two colors of the checkerboard
coloring). We get in this way a checkerboard coloring of the pillowcases C/Hn. Let
Qn be the graph consisting of the sides of the half-integral grid on C/Hn.
The vertices of the graph Γ1,v are centers of squares of one color in the checker-
board coloring of C/Hn. Since Γ1,v is a tree, there is a closed Eulerian path ρv in
Qn without transversal self-intersections, which goes around Γ1,v, i.e., does not in-
tersect it transversally, see Figure 28, where the squares containing Γ1,v are colored
red, and the other squares are white. The path ρv is the boundary of the white
region (after we glue the picture into a pillowcase).

Note that, unlike for the path λv, there are no problems in the deﬁnition of ρv

concerning the singular points.

Figure 28. Path ρv

See more examples of the paths ρv on Figure 29, where their connected lifts to

C are shown.

Recall that the curve λv describes the action of τ on the vertices of Γ1,v. It is
easy to check that ρv is obtained from λv by the replacements of segments of λv
between vertices of Γ1,v by curves shown on Figure 30. In particular, the curves
ρv also approximate the plane-ﬁlling curves coming from the matings described in
Proposition 4.2.

Figure 29. Paths ρv around Γv

Figure 30. Changing λv to ρv

also goes around the white cells, and these cells are arranged into a tree around
which ρv travels. Let us try to interpret this “white” tree in terms of the group G.
Let ζ1 = 1/4 + i/4 and ζ2 = 1/4 − i/4. Let Σ1 = ΓH be the left Cayley graph
of H with the set of vertices ζ1 · H and the edges corresponding to the generators
A, B, C, CAB. Let Σ2 be the left Cayley graph of H with the set of vertices ζ2 · H
and the edges corresponding to the generators A, ABA, C, ABC.

See Figure 31 for the graphs Σ1, Σ2. Note that each edge of Σ1 intersects
exactly one edge of Σ2 and vice versa. Namely, the edges of Σ1 corresponding
to A, B, C, and CAB intersect the edges of Σ2 corresponding to A, ABA, C, and
ABC, respectively.
For a given word v = X (1)X (2) . . . X (n) ∈ {L, R}∗ of length n, denote by Σ1,v and
Σ2,v the Schreier graphs of the groups G1 and G2 acting on the set X (1) × X (2) ×
1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ X (n)
··· × X (n) (i.e., on the set of the right orbits of the bisets X (1)
and X (1)
, respectively) deﬁned with respect to the generating
sets {α1 = CAB, β1, γ1} and {α2 = A, α2β2α2, γ2}. We identify them with the
corresponding sub-graphs of the graphs Σ1/Hn and Σ2/Hn, respectively.
Proposition 5.1. The graphs Σ1,v and Σ2,v do not intersect (as subsets of C/Hn).
In each pair of intersecting edges of Σ1/Hn and Σ2/Hn one edge belongs to one of
the graphs Σ1,v and Σ2,v and the other edge does not belong to either graphs.

Figure 31.

It follows that ρv separates the trees Σ1,v = Γ1,v and Σ2,v, and that the graphs
Σ1,v and Σ2,v describe adjacency of the cells on the corresponding side of the curve
ρv.

Proof. Connect the basepoints ζ1 and ζ2 by a straight segment (cid:96). The points ζ1
and ζ2 as vertices of the Cayley graphs Σ1 and Σ2 correspond to the identity in
the group H. It follows that the images of (cid:96) under the action of H connect the
vertices of Σ1 and Σ2 corresponding to the same elements of H.
It follows now
from the construction of the graphs Σi (see Figure 5.2) that the edge connecting
h ∈ H to Ch in Σ1 intersects with the edge connecting the corresponding vertices
in Σ2. The same statement for the edges connecting h to Ah is true. The edge in
Σ1 connecting Ah to BAh intersects the edge in Σ2 connecting h to ABAh.

If the graph Σ1,v contains an edge from w to γ1(w) = C(w), then the graph Σ2,v
does not contain an edge connecting w to γ2(w), and vice versa. The edge w to
γ1(w) coincides with the edge from some h to Ch in Σ1, while the edge from w to
γ2(w) coincides with the edge from the same element h to Ch in Σ2. This settles
the statement for the edges (w, γi(w)).

The edge from w to α2(w) corresponds to the edge from h to Ah, which is not
included into Σ1. Similarly, the edge from w to α1(w) = CAB(w) is not included
into Σ2.
If Σ2(w) contains an edge from w to α2β2α2(w) = ABA(w), then w (cid:54)= α2β2α2(w),
i.e., α2(w) (cid:54)= β2α2(w), which is equivalent to the condition that the graph Σ1(w)
(cid:3)
does not have an edge from A(w) to BA(w).

Proposition 5.2. The graphs Σ1,v and Σ2,v are isomorphic for every word v.
Proof. We know, see 4.3, that for every ﬁnite sequences v = X1X2 . . . Xn ∈ {L, R}∗
∼= G-biset a · X1 ⊗

that the map

Since the singular points ZA, ZB, ZC, and ZCAB of the orbifold C/Hn belong to

ρv(X1, X2) is equal to the image of the previous path ρv(X0, X1) under rotation by

ρv(C, A)∪ ρv(A, B) with its image under rotation by −π/2 (resp. π/2) around Z(cid:48)

or on the right side, if Xn = R (see Figure 34). Repeat now the procedure for the
word X1X2 . . . Xn−1. After n steps unfold the strip so that all bends are at right

Consider the group B = (cid:104)S, γα, β(cid:105) = (cid:104)S(cid:105) × (cid:104)γα, β(cid:105). Let us write the images of

the generators under the wreath recursion.

S = σπ(P βαγ, P, S−1βαγ, S−1),
γα = σ(1, γβ, α, γαβ),

β = (1, βαβ, α, 1).

Conjugate the right hand side of the recursion by (34)(β, β, P βαγβ, P β):

S = (13)(24)(1, 1, T, T ),

γα = σ(1, βγ, 1, βγ),

β = (1, α, 1, α).

We see that in the right hand side of the recursion we get elements of the group
A = (cid:104)T, βγ, α(cid:105) = (cid:104)T(cid:105) × (cid:104)βγ, α(cid:105). Moreover, the corresponding (B − A)-biset MB,A
is the direct product of the ((cid:104)S(cid:105) − (cid:104)T(cid:105))-biset given by the binary recursion

with the ((cid:104)γα, β(cid:105) − (cid:104)βγ, α(cid:105))-biset given by the recursion
(19)

γα = σ(1, βγ),

S = σ(1, T ),

(20)

β = (1, α).

The following proposition is proved by direct computation.

Proposition 6.1. The biset over free groups of rank two given by the wreath re-
cursion (19)–(20) is isomorphic to the biset associated with the partial covering

C \ {0, 1} ⊃ C \ {1, 0, 2} → C \ {0, 1}

deﬁned by the polynomial (1 − z)2, where γα and β correspond to the loops around
punctures 0 and 1, respectively, and the generators βγ and α correspond to the loops
around 1 and 0, respectively.

The generators of the group A are decomposed (in the original recursion) as

follows:

T = (P, βP β, γSγ, S),

βγ = (γ, βα, αγ, β),

α = σ(β, β, βα, αβ).

Conjugate the wreath recursion by (1, β, α, β):

T = (P, P, S, S),

βγ = (γ, αβ, γα, β),

α = σ.

Restricting to the last two coordinates of the wreath recursion (i.e., to the biset
R) we get a biset MA,B, which is a direct product of the biset deﬁned by the
isomorphism T (cid:55)→ S and the ((cid:104)βγ, α(cid:105) − (cid:104)γα, β(cid:105))-biset given by the recursion

βγ = (γ, αβ),

(22)

α = σ.

The proof of the following proposition is also straightforward.

MATING, PAPER FOLDING, AND AN ENDOMORPHISM OF PC2

Proposition 6.2. The biset over the free groups deﬁned by the wreath recur-
sion (21)–(22) is isomorphic to the biset associated with the partial covering

C \ {0, 1} ⊃ C \ {0, 1, 1/2} → C \ {0, 1},

given by the polynomial (2z − 1)2, where the generators α and βγ correspond to the
loops around 0 and 1, while the generators γ and αβ correspond to the loops around
1 and 0, respectively.

B are self-similar subgroups of IMG(cid:0)F ◦2(cid:1).

Taking tensor products MB,A ⊗A MA,B and MA,B ⊗B MB,A we see that A and

Corollary 6.3. The bisets MB,A ⊗A MA,B and MA,B ⊗B MB,A are isomorphic to
the bisets associated with the post-critically ﬁnite polynomials (2(1 − z)2 − 1)2 =
(2z2 − 4z + 1)2 and (1 − (2z − 1)2)2 = 16z2(1 − z)2, respectively.

Proof. It follows from Propositions 6.1, 6.2.

(cid:3)
Note that the polynomials 16z2(1 − z)2 and (2z2 − 4z + 1)2 coincide with the
restrictions of the second iteration of the endomorphism F of PC2 to the post-critical
lines p = 1 and p = 0, respectively. The action of F is written in homogeneous
coordinates as

[z : p : u] (cid:55)→ [(2z − p − u)2 : (p − u)2 : (p + u)2],

hence its restriction to the line p = u is

[z : p : p] (cid:55)→ [(2z − 2p)2 : 0 : 4p2],

so that it acts on the ﬁrst coordinate (in non-homogeneous coordinates) as

z (cid:55)→ (z − 1)2.

Restriction of F onto the line p = 0 is

[z : 0 : u] (cid:55)→ [(2z − u)2 : u2 : u2],

i.e.,

z (cid:55)→ (2z − 1)2.

Proposition 6.4. The limit spaces of (A, MA,B ⊗ MB,A) and (B, MB,A ⊗ MA,B)
are direct products of circles with the Julia sets of the polynomials 16z2(1− z)2 and
(2z2 − 4z + 1)2, respectively. The images of JA and JB in JIMG(F ) are identiﬁed
with the subsets of the Julia set projected by (z, p) (cid:55)→ p to the boundaries of the
Fatou components of f (p) =

, containing 1 and 0, respectively.

Proof. Description of the limit space follows directly from the structure of the
wreath recursion and Corollary 6.3. The groups (cid:104)α, βγ(cid:105) and (cid:104)β, γα(cid:105) are level-
transitive, which implies that the map from the limit spaces of A and B to the limit
space of IMG (F ) is surjective on the ﬁbers of the natural projection JIMG(F ) →
JIMG(f ).
It follows from the post-critical dynamics of f and the interpretation of the maps
S and P as loops in the space C \ {0, 1} (see Proposition 3.8) that the images of
the limit spaces JA and JB in the Julia set of f are the boundaries of the Fatou
(cid:3)
components of 1 and 0, respectively.

Consider the group B1 = (cid:104)γ, α, S(cid:105). Its generators are written as

α = σ(β, β, βα, αβ),

γ = (γ, β, γ, β),
S = πσ(P βαγ, P, S−1βαγ, S−1),
Conjugating the right-hand side by (1, β, P, P βα) we get

α = σ,

γ = (γ, β, γ, β),

Sγα = π(1, 1, T βγ, T βγ).

Consider now the group A1 = (cid:104)γ, β, T(cid:105). We have
β = (1, βαβ, α, 1),

γ = (γ, β, γ, β),

T = (P, βP β, αSα, S),

T βγ = (P γ, βP α, Sγα, Sβ).

Restriction to the third coordinate of the wreath recursion is the homomorphism

S = σ(1, T ),

Sγα = (T, βγ),
(here we use a conjugated version (19)–(20)), and

βγ (cid:55)→ γα,
T (cid:55)→ S,

T βγ (cid:55)→ Sγα.

It follows from the recursions and post-critical dynamics of the polynomials
16z2(1− z)2 and (2z2− 4z + 1)2 that the limit space of (cid:104)γα, S(cid:105) with respect to these
recursions is the natural direct product of the boundary of the Fatou component
of f containing 0 (which is the limit space of the subgroup (cid:104)S(cid:105)) and the boundary
of the Fatou component of (2z2 − 4z + 1)2 containing 0 (the limit space of (cid:104)γα(cid:105)).
Similarly, the limit space of (cid:104)βγ, T(cid:105) is the direct product of the the boundary of the
Fatou component of f containing 1 (the limit space of (cid:104)T(cid:105)) with the boundary of
the Fatou component of 16z2(1− z)2 containing 1 (the limit space of (cid:104)βγ(cid:105)). Hence,
both limit spaces are tori.
In particular, the natural maps from the limit spaces of the groups (cid:104)γα, S(cid:105) and
(cid:104)βγ, T(cid:105) to JB and JA, respectively, are injective.
Let us compare the limit spaces of these groups with the limit spaces of their
extensions B1 and A1. We have B1 = (cid:104)α, γ(cid:105) × (cid:104)Sγα(cid:105), A1 = (cid:104)β, γ(cid:105) × (cid:104)T βγ(cid:105). The
direct factors (cid:104)α, γ(cid:105) and (cid:104)β, γ(cid:105) are inﬁnite dihedral with the wreath recursions

α = σ,

γ = (γ, β),

and

β (cid:55)→ α,

γ (cid:55)→ γ.

It follows that the limit spaces of the subgroups (cid:104)α, γ(cid:105) and (cid:104)β, γ(cid:105) are segments with
singular endpoints (one with the isotropy group (cid:104)α(cid:105) or (cid:104)β(cid:105) and the other with the
isotropy group (cid:104)γ(cid:105)).
Consequently, the limit spaces of B1 and A1 are annuli (direct products of a
circle and a segment) and that the natural map from the limit spaces of (cid:104)γα, S(cid:105)
and (cid:104)βγ, T(cid:105) to the limit spaces of B1 and A1 “ﬂattens” the tori into annuli, by
ﬂattening the circles J(cid:104)γα(cid:105) and J(cid:104)βγ(cid:105) to the segments J(cid:104)γ,α(cid:105) and J(cid:104)β,γ(cid:105). Note
that the natural direct product decomposition of the spaces J(cid:104)γα,S(cid:105) and J(cid:104)βγ,T(cid:105)
comes from the direct product decompositions (cid:104)γα(cid:105)×(cid:104)S(cid:105) and (cid:104)βγ(cid:105)×(cid:104)T(cid:105), while we
have decompositions of self-similar groups B1 = (cid:104)γ, α(cid:105) × (cid:104)Sγα(cid:105) and A1 = (cid:104)β, γ(cid:105) ×
(cid:104)T βγ(cid:105). Consequently, the preimages of the boundaries of the annuli in the tori are
diagonals with respect to the natural decomposition of the torus into the product
of the boundaries of the Fatou components.
It means that the diameter with
respect to which we ﬂatten the boundary of the Fatou component of the polynomials
16z2(1−z)2 and (2z2−4z +1)2 rotates as p travels along the boundary of the Fatou
component of f .
This ﬂattening of the circles into segments can be interpreted as a “rotated
tuning” of the polynomials 16z2(1 − z)2 and (2z2 − 4z + 1)2 by the polynomial
z2 − 2 (which is the quadratic polynomial with the dihedral iterated monodromy

group and the Julia set a segment).
It can be nicely illustrated by the slices of
the Julia set of F as p travels close to the boundary of the Fatou component of f ,
but stays inside in it. Then the slices are still homeomorphic to the Julia sets of
16z2(1 − z)2 and (2z2 − 4z + 1)2, but are close to the dendrite slices of the Julia
set of F along to boundary of the Fatou component of f .

See Figure 36 where slices of the Julia set of F are shown when p is traveling
close to the boundary of the Fatou component of f containing 1 (top half of the
ﬁgure). Corresponding slices for p on the boundary of the Fatou component are
shown in the bottom part of the ﬁgure.
