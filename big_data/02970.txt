ABSTRACT
We describe a far infrared survey of the Coma cluster and the galaxy ﬁlament it resides within.
Our survey covers an area of ∼150 deg2 observed by Herschel H-ATLAS in ﬁve bands at 100,
160, 250, 350 and 500 µm. The SDSS spectroscopic survey (mr (cid:54) 17.8) is used to deﬁne an
area (within the Virial radius) and redshift selected (4268 < v < 9700 km s−1) sample of 744
Coma cluster galaxies - the Coma Cluster Catalogue (CCC). For comparison we also deﬁne
a sample of 951 galaxies in the connecting ﬁlament - the Coma Filament Catalogue (CFC).
The optical positions and parameters are used to deﬁne appropriate apertures to measure each
galaxy’s far infrared emission. We have detected 99 of 744 (13 %) and 422 of 951 (44 %) of
the cluster and ﬁlament galaxies in the SPIRE 250 µm band. We consider the relative detection
rates of galaxies of different morphological types ﬁnding that it is only the S0/Sa population
that shows clear differences between the cluster and ﬁlament. We ﬁnd no differences between
the dust masses and temperatures of cluster and ﬁlament galaxies with the exception of early
type galaxy dust temperatures, which are signiﬁcantly hotter in the cluster than in the ﬁla-
ment (X-ray heating?). From a chemical evolution model we ﬁnd no evidence for different
evolutionary processes (gas loss or infall) between galaxies in the cluster and ﬁlament.
Key words: galaxies: ISM – galaxies: clusters: individual: Coma – galaxies: photometry –
infrared: galaxies.

INTRODUCTION

The Coma cluster is a local example of a giant relaxed structure.
Coma is located at a distance of ∼ 100 Mpc, has a mass of ∼ 1015
M(cid:12) and a virial radius ∼3 Mpc (Girardi et al. (1998), Boselli &
Gavazzi (2006)). The cluster resides in a large ﬁlamentary struc-
ture known as the ‘Great Wall’, which is an over density (galactic
ﬁlament) of galaxies linking Coma with other groups and clusters
including another nearby cluster A1367 (Ramella et al. 1992). The
cluster resides at a high galactic latitude of b=88.0o, making it ideal
for extra-galactic studies at all wavelengths. Notably observed us-
ing the 48 inch reﬂector on Mount Wilson by Zwicky (1951) it

ipation from NASA.

was not until 1983 that Godwin & Peach (1977) created the most
cited optical catalogue of ‘Coma’ galaxies. They catalogued over
6000 galaxies in the region of the cluster, but not all of these are
cluster members as the origin of their data was photographic plate
imaging, with no spectroscopy to distinguish cluster members from
the foreground/background. For this reason an important ﬁrst part
of our project has been to produce an optical catalogue of Coma
cluster members that can be used in the same way as that used
for other nearby clusters such as Virgo (Virgo Cluster Catalogue
(VCC), Binggeli et al. (1985)) and Fornax (Fornax Cluster Cata-
logue (FCC), Ferguson (1989)).

Compared to a cluster like Virgo, Coma has a much more cen-
trally concentrated distribution of galaxies and mass. The latter can
be inferred from the X-ray emitting gas (Colless & Dunn 1995),
which is thought to be material originally lost by member galaxies,
that now traces the gravitational potential of the cluster. The X-ray

2

Fuller et al.

gas shows a mostly smooth, centrally concentrated distribution of
mass. This X-ray emitting gas can also have a signiﬁcant effect on
galaxies as they plunge through the cluster at relatively high ve-
locities (∼1000 km s−1). Ram pressure stripping (Gunn & Gott
1972) and thermal evaporation (Cowie & McKee 1977) act to re-
move atomic hydrogen from galaxies as bright as L∗ on time scales
comparable to a cluster crossing time, which for Coma is at most a
few Gyr (Boselli & Gavazzi 2006). Thus we might expect the star
formation history of Coma cluster galaxies to be very different to
those that reside outside or on the outskirts of the cluster (Kenni-
cutt et al. (1984), Donas et al. (1995), Gavazzi et al. (1998), Gavazzi
et al. (1998), Gavazzi et al. (1998), Gavazzi et al. (2010), Cybulski
et al. (2014)). Indeed, we ﬁnd strong morphological segregation
in Coma, with a large proportion of its members being early-type
galaxies (see below). The inter-stellar medium (ISM) of the clus-
ter late-type galaxies is observed to be affected by the cluster en-
vironment (Giovanelli & Haynes (1985), Gavazzi (1989), Solanes
et al. (2001), Casoli et al. (1996), Fumagalli et al. (2009), Boselli
et al. (2014), Cortese et al. (2010), Cortese (2012)), something that
is supported by simulation (Tonnesen et al. (2007), Roediger &
Br¨uggen (2008)). Gavazzi et al. (2006) found that Coma galax-
ies are HI-deﬁcient to ∼1.5 times the clusters Virial radius, and
most HI deﬁcient at the X-ray centre of the cluster. Given this obvi-
ously environmental dependence on interstellar medium properties
we will also study here for comparison, along with the Coma clus-
ter galaxies, a sample of galaxies residing in the Great Wall, well
beyond the Virial radius (deﬁned below) of the cluster.

Although this paper makes use of our optically selected cat-
alogue of Coma (cluster) and Great Wall (ﬁlament) galaxies it is
primarily concerned with Herschel Space Telescope observations
at far-infrared wavelengths (see also, Bicay & Giovanelli (1987),
Contursi et al. (2001), Bai et al. (2006)). These far-infrared obser-
vations are predominately measuring emission from relatively cold
(10-50 K) cosmic dust. This cosmic dust has been shown to be a
good tracer of star formation, molecular material and of metal con-
tent and hence galactic chemical evolution, which are themes we
explore in this paper.

Due to extinction in the Earth’s atmosphere far-infrared obser-
vations are limited to space based telescopes. Previously the ﬁrst
infrared space mission, IRAS (Neugebauer et al. 1984) detected 41
sources in Coma as part of its all sky survey (wavelengths 25-100
µm). The sample was almost entirely composed of late type galax-
ies in the periphery of the cluster. Subsequently using ISO (Kessler
et al. 1996), which extended the far infrared wavelength coverage to
∼200 µm), Contursi et al. (2001) detected 11 Coma galaxies. They
found that even though the galaxies where interacting with the in-
tergalactic medium, their dust properties seemed to be strangely
un-affected by this. ISO’s extended wavelength coverage also re-
vealed a previously unseen cold dust component (∼10K), but it was
rather poorly constrained because of lack of data beyond 200µm.
The Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al. 2004) did not extend
the wavelength coverage of ISO, but it did improve sensitivity. Ed-
wards & Fadda (2011) used Spitzer to observe multiple ﬁelds in
Coma covering a total area of ∼3 deg2, approximately 1/9 of the
area traced by the Virial radius. They conﬁrmed that star formation
was strongly suppressed in Coma’s core and observed some star-
burst galaxies in the south west, which they identiﬁed as a region
where galaxies were currently falling into the cluster for the ﬁrst
time.
The above instruments primarily allowed the study of what we
would now refer to as warm dust (T≈30 K). They were limited in
their ability to constrain the amount of cold dust (T<30 K) as they

did not provide accurate measurements of the Raleigh-Jeans tail of
the modiﬁed blackbody emission, which typically has been shown
to peak at ∼160 µm (Davies et al. 2012).

The Herschel Space Telescope (Pilbratt et al. 2010) and its
instruments were designed to overcome this problem, enabling ob-
servations out to about 500 µm and hence a measurement of the
total dust content of galaxies. These observations can be used to
investigate the issues brieﬂy outlined above.

Previously Hickinbottom et al. (2014) have published deep
Herschel observations of 1.75 sq deg of the Coma cluster core at
70, 100 and 160µm. We can now extend these observations both
spatially and in wavelength range.

The Coma cluster was also observed as part of The Herschel
Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) (Eales
et al. 2010) and it is this data we use in this paper. This is the largest
Herschel FIR extra-galactic survey covering 570 deg2 in 5 bands
centred at 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 µm. With high Galactic lat-
itudes the H-ATLAS ﬁelds are all located in areas of low galactic
cirrus, Coma being part of the Northern Galactic Cap (NGP) ﬁeld.
Along with Coma there is also a wide spatial coverage of the sur-
rounding areas well beyond the cluster’s Virial radius into its con-
necting galactic ﬁlament.

2 THE OPTICAL SELECTION OF CLUSTER AND

FILAMENT GALAXIES

Unlike our previous work on the Virgo (Davies et al. 2014) and
Fornax (Fuller et al. 2014) clusters there is no equivalent optical
catalogue of Coma cluster galaxies1. Our previous papers on Virgo
and Fornax used optical data from the VCC and FCC to distin-
guish cluster members from background galaxies. The often cited
Coma catalogue of Godwin & Peach (1977) is actually just a list
of all objects detected on a photographic plate with no additional
means of separating cluster from non-cluster galaxies. Speciﬁc red-
shift surveys do exist for various parts of the Coma region, (Kent
& Gunn 1982; Colless & Dunn 1996; Geller et al. 1999; Castander
et al. 2001; Mobasher et al. 2001), but the lack of homogeneity of
these surveys precluded the generation of a uniﬁed redshift selected
Coma cluster catalogue suitable for our purposes.

However, this region of the sky is now covered by both the
spectroscopic and photometric SDSS surveys, and thus allows us
to select a clearly deﬁned optical catalogue with secure redshifts.
This also enables us to select and isolate both Coma cluster and
ﬁlament (‘Great Wall’) galaxies. Our hope is that this Coma Clus-
ter Catalogue (CCC) will be as useful a tool for studies of nearby
galaxies and clusters as both the VCC and FCC have already been.
The SDSS Main Galaxy Sample (MGS) is selected from the
spectroscopic survey according to criteria discussed extensively
in Strauss et al. (2002). Brieﬂy, objects are selected if they are de-
tected at 5σ or above in the r band. Galaxies are then separated
from stars by deciding if they are point or extended sources and
also stipulating that they have not been ﬂagged as SATURATED,
BRIGHT, or BLENDED. Finally the selected sources must have an
r band apparent magnitude brighter than mr = 17.82. The SDSS
spectrograph also had the physical limitation that two ﬁbres could

Hughes 1989; The & White 1986). After adjusting to a common
distance scale (H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1) we have used the mean of
these four values for the Virial radius i.e. 3.1± 0.7 Mpc.

We deﬁne a velocity selection similar to the VCC’s (Binggeli
et al. 1985) i.e. using the velocity dispersion (σ) of a Gaussian func-
tion ﬁtted to galaxies within the projected Virial radius. However,
this velocity dispersion is sensitive to the initial ‘rough’ velocity
selection used (see above). In order to overcome this problem we
have used an iterative method to deﬁne the cluster population. We
ﬁt a Gaussian function to the velocity data, then remove galaxies
that are outside of 3σ and then re-ﬁt the Gaussian function until
the value for σ converges.

Figure 1 & 2 indicate that this is an appropriate method for
deﬁning the cluster galaxies. The goodness of ﬁt of a Gaussian to
the histogram of velocities gives, χ2

There are 774 SDSS galaxies spectroscopically conﬁrmed
within these limits and these galaxies are henceforth referred to as
members of the Coma Cluster Catalogue (CCC). The galaxies are
listed in appendix A1 of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astro-
nomical Society on-line material.

2.2 Deﬁning the ﬁlament

The Coma cluster sits within a ﬁlamentary structure, which is
an over density of galaxies that connects it with numerous other
groups and clusters. Deﬁning a ‘ﬁlament’ sample is a rather sub-
jective process because unlike the Coma cluster it is clearly a non-
Virialised structure. However, within the ﬁlament there are nu-
merous loose-groupings and a range of galaxy densities, making
it an interesting region to compare with the cluster sample. Fig-
ure 2 clearly shows that the ﬁlament that the cluster sits within,
the over density at ∼ 7000 km s−1, extends well beyond 18 Mpc
(∼ 6RVirial). These are galaxies at about the same recessional veloc-
ity as Coma, but spread in a linear structure across the sky. We de-
ﬁne the ﬁlament sample as any galaxy that falls within the bounds
of the NGP survey area, but outside the Viral radius of Coma. In
addition each selected galaxy must satisfy the same velocity crite-
ria i.e. 4268 < v < 9700 km s−1 as our Coma cluster sample. This
yields 951 ﬁlament galaxies, which we will refer to as the Coma
Filament Catalogue (CFC). The galaxies are listed in appendix B1
of the of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
on-line material.

not be closer together than 55” or ∼28 kpc at a Coma distance of
105 Mpc (Boselli & Gavazzi 2006), but this was not a problem for
the bright Coma cluster galaxies considered here (mr = 17.8 cor-
responds to an absolute magnitude of ≈ −17.3 at the above Coma
distance). Our sample is selected from the MGS (SDSS DR10) by
isolating the cluster and ﬁlament in both spatial and velocity extent.
Our initial selection was for all galaxies within a velocity
range 3000 to 11000 km s−1, with a spatial selection over the area
of the Herschel NGP ﬁeld. The velocity range is roughly symmet-
rical about the current value for Coma’s mean velocity as listed in
the Nasa Extragalactic Database3 (NED) of ∼ 7000 km s−1.

2.1 Deﬁning the cluster

Many clusters are far from Virial equilibrium and so R200, the ra-
dius at which the mass density drops to 1/200 of the critical density,
is often used as a measure of their size. Coma however appears to
be a dynamically mature cluster, making the Virial radius a less ar-
bitrary choice in this particular case. A cluster in Virial equilibrium
would have a velocity distribution perfectly traced by a Gaussian
function. Figure 1 (details below) shows that this is a good inter-
pretation of the Coma data.

We have deﬁned the centre of Coma as the position of peak X-
ray emission (Colless & Dunn 1995). This X-ray emitting gas is a
much more reliable indicator of the mass distribution of the cluster
than the optical surface density of galaxies, as it better traces the to-
tal mass distribution. Using this deﬁnition we measure the centre to
be at: RA(J2000)=12h59m48.7s and DEC(J2000)=+27d58m50.0s.
From the literature we have found four different derived values for
the Virial radius of Coma (Kubo et al. 2007; Geller et al. 1999;

able through Goldmine. We ﬁnd a good one-to-one linear relationship
across the whole range of magnitudes used.

region selected for the ﬁlament sample. The ﬁlament structure is well deﬁned out to and beyond 6× the cluster Virial radius. There are reasonably well deﬁned
voids in front of and behind the cluster.

vey ﬁeld is shown in Figure 3 along with the positions of the galax-
ies selected as part of the CCC and CFC samples.

The H-ATLAS survey consists of parallel scan map data from
the PACS instrument (Poglitsch et al. 2010) at 100 and 160µm and
the SPIRE instrument (Grifﬁn et al. 2010) at 250, 350 and 500µm.
The PACS data were processed using an updated version of the
pipeline presented in Ibar et al. (2010) that now scans the data to
identify timeline jumps and glitches (see Valiante et al. in prep).
Then the two scans were combined using the Scanamorphous map
maker (Roussel 2013). The SPIRE data were processed with a cus-
tomised pipeline, which is very similar to the ofﬁcial pipeline with
the exception that we used a method called BriGAdE (Smith et al.,
in preparation), in place of the standard temperature drift correc-
tion. BriGAdE effectively corrects all the bolometers for thermal
drift without removing large extended structures like Galactic cir-
rus. The two scans were then combined using the mapping software
in the standard Herschel pipeline.

The ﬁnal NGP maps have pixel sizes of 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12
arc seconds and 1σ noise measured over the entire image of 0.8,
1.1, 0.9, 0.9 and 1.1 mJy pixel−1 (or 24.0, 43.8, 11.3, 11.6 and
12.4 mJy beam−1) for 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 µm, respectively.
Beam sizes are of order 2-3 times the pixel size so at the distance
of Coma, where 10 arc seconds (cid:39) 5 kpc, we have the potential to
crudely resolve some of the larger galaxies. For example, the two
biggest galaxies in the cluster are NGC 4839 and 4889 with optical
diameters (D25) of 3.6 and 3.3 arc minutes, respectively.

2.4 Comparsion with HeViCS and HeFoCS

Below we will compare the Coma Herschel data with that previ-
ously published by us on the Virgo (Davies et al. 2014) and Fornax
(Fuller et al. 2014) clusters. These data were obtained as part of the
Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) and the Herschel Fornax
Cluster Survey (HeFoCS). The FIR maps of all three surveys were
created using identical data reduction techniques. However, they
differ with respect to depth and spatial coverage of the clusters.

2 and ∼√

would expect ∼√

First, we consider the depth of the three surveys. The HeViCS
maps consist of 8 scans (4 pairs of orthogonal cross-linking scans),
which is two and four times as many scans as the HeFoCS and H-
ATLAS data respectively. For detector random Poisson noise we
4 increase in instrumental noise in
the latter two surveys compared to HeViCS. However, Auld et al.
(2013) calculated separately the instrumental and confusion noise
and showed that the HeViCS SPIRE bands were effectively con-
fusion noise limited (70 % of the overall noise is from confusion
at 250 µm). Consequently, when planning the HeFoCS survey only
four scans were requested as this produced confusion limited maps
with half the time required for a single HeViCS tile. The H-ATLAS
(NGP) survey was designed to cover as much area as possible and
consequently with its two scans does not reach the confusion noise
at 250µm.

In order to measure the ratio of the global noise in the HeViCS,
HeFoCS and H-ATLAS NGP maps, we measure the pixel-pixel
ﬂuctuations and apply an iterative 3σ clip to remove bright sources.
The measured ‘global’ noise in the HeViCS, HeFoCS and NGP at
250 µm is: 7.5, 8.9 and 11.3 mJy beam−1, respectively. Yielding
measured noise ratios between the HeViCS-HeFoCS and HeViCS-

NGP of 1.2 and 1.5, respectively i.e. not simple Poisson noise be-
cause of the constant contribution of source confusion - thus the
surveys are better suited for comparison than initial expectation.

Second, we consider the coverage of the HeViCS, HeFoCS
and NGP FIR maps of their respective clusters. The Coma cluster
is covered well beyond the Virial radius, however calculating the
coverage for the other surveys is less straightforward. The clusters
have very different physical sizes and states of relaxation - Virgo is
far more ‘clumpy’ than Fornax or Coma (Davies et al. 2014). The
HeViCS FIR maps consist of four tiles each of 4◦ × 4◦ running
North to South (Davies et al. 2012), whereas the HeFoCS is only a
single tile of 4◦ × 4◦ (Fuller et al. 2014). Virgo and Fornax are at
about the same distance from us (∼17 Mpc), but Fornax is physi-
cally much smaller than Virgo (by about a factor of four). However,
the Herschel data does include about the same fraction of VCC and
FCC galaxies - about 2
3 of them in both cases. Of course more prob-
lematic when comparing the properties of the clusters is the more
than ﬁve times greater distance to Coma than to either Virgo or For-
nax - this and the relevant areas covered by the three surveys will
be discussed further below.

2.5 Flux Measurement

2.5.1 General approach

We have used a semi-automated ﬂux measurement program, to
measure the FIR ﬂux density of each galaxy in the CCC and CFC.
This program is fully described and extensively tested by Auld et al.
(2013). The method is brieﬂy described below.

The optical parameters (position, eccentricity, optical diame-
ter D25 and position angle) from the optical catalogues were used to
make an initial estimate of the shape and size of the FIR emission.
Previous studies (Cortese et al. 2010; Pohlen et al. 2010) show that
FIR emission is well traced by the optical parameters of late-type
galaxies. Whereas early-type galaxies typically show more com-
pact dust emission (Smith et al. 2012). The optical parameters are
only used to make an initial estimate for creating masks. The pro-
gram then iterates, to create new masks and apertures (of the same
size for each FIR band) that best match the diameter and elliptic-
ity of the FIR emission. The following explanation of the process
relates to the information shown in Figure 4.
The ﬂux measurement process starts by extracting a 200× 200

enough to give an accurate background estimation, then the pro-
gram will increase the size of the sub-image, up to 600×600 pixels
for SPIRE and 1200×1200 pixels for PACS data.

The background estimation has to deal with the near confu-
sion limited SPIRE maps and instrumental noise in the PACS maps.
The program was originally written for use with the HeViCS maps
where Galactic cirrus was also a major problem. In order to remove
bright background galaxies and galactic cirrus Auld et al. (2013)
used a 98% ﬂux clip and then ﬁtted the remaining pixels with a
2D polynomial. The ﬂux clip, removes bright background galaxies
by masking out the brightest 2% of pixels, this ensures that the 2D
polynomial is only ﬁtting the background. Unlike the Virgo ﬁelds
cirrus is not obviously present in the NGP maps and so the 98%
clip is retained, but then we just use the median pixel value of the
masked sub-image as the background value.

For each detected source we measure total ﬂux, surface bright-
ness, aperture noise (fully described in Section 2.5.2) and signal
to noise (S/N) around annuli of increasing radii centred on the
galaxy’s optical centre. The shape of the annuli is based on the
galaxy’s optical parameters convolved with the appropriate point
spread function (PSF). As an example we plot the corresponding
radial proﬁles in Figure 4 c, e & f, respectively. The FIR diameter4
DFIR is deﬁned where the S/N proﬁle drops below 2. This DFIR
is used to replace the 1.5×D25 used to make the initial mask. The
process iterates until the mask and the DFIR value converge. We
then applied an aperture correction as given in Ibar et al. (2010) -
this takes account of the encircled energy fraction within the chosen
aperture size.

For objects where the total S/N value was less than 3, the
sub-image was searched for a point source. After convolving with
the relevant wavelength dependent point spread function (PSF), the
maximum pixel value within the FWHM of the PSF centred on
the optical position was taken as the ﬂux. The noise was calcu-
lated according to Marsden et al. (2009) and Chapin et al. (2011).
This involves plotting a histogram of all the pixel values in the PSF-
convolved sub-image and ﬁtting a Gaussian function to the negative
tail. The FWHM of this Gaussian is then used to estimate the com-
bined instrumental and confusion noise. This has been summed in
quadrature with the calibration uncertainty (see below) to obtain a
value for the total noise. If the S/N was still less than 3 we consider
the object undetected and set an upper limit on the ﬂux equal to 3
times the noise in the PSF-convolved sub-image. So, for the opti-
cally selected galaxies that do not have a FIR detection we have
set an upper limit on their FIR ﬂux density equal to the 3σ noise
from the PSF-convolved map. This marked the end of the automatic
source measurement process. The output is in the form of data ﬁles
for each galaxy and the visual output shown in Figure 4. Tables A1
and B1 in the appendix lists ﬂux measurements (or lack of) for all
galaxies in the CCC and CFC samples (see the Monthly Notices of
the Royal Astronomical Society on-line material).

2.5.2 Total error estimate

The total error on each ﬂux density measurement is estimated from
the calibration uncertainty, σcal and aperture uncertainty, σaper,
summed in quadrature.

For SPIRE, σcal is based on single scans of Neptune and on
an assumed model of its emission. The ﬁnal error for each band is
estimated to include 4% correlated and 1.5% from random variation
in repeated measurements. The SPIRE observer’s manual5 suggests
that these should be added together, leading to a SPIRE σcal of
5.5%.

For PACS, σcal is based on multiple sources with different
models of emission. The PACS observer’s manual6 lists the uncor-
related uncertainties as 3 % & 4 % for 100 and 160 µm, respec-
tively, and the correlated uncertainty is given for point sources as
2.2 %. However, the data used for calculating these uncertainties
were reduced and analysed in a different way to our data. Auld
et al. (2013) considered this problem and concluded that there was
about a 12 % calibration uncertainty, which is the value we adopt
here.

To calculate the aperture uncertainty (σaper) a large number of
apertures of a ﬁxed size were placed randomly on each sub-image.
We measure the total ﬂux in each aperture, then by applying an
iterative 3σ clipping procedure use σ as the uncertainty for that
aperture. Repeating this for a range of aperture sizes allows us to
estimate the aperture uncertainty as a function of size. This method
takes into account, both confusion noise and instrumental noise.
Figure 4d shows a plot of aperture noise against radial distance.

2.5.3 Dealing with Blending and Contamination

Herschel’s comparatively large beam size can lead to unavoidable
contamination by FIR background sources, which could be falsely
identiﬁed with the optical source. Due to the distance of Coma
many of the CCC and CFC galaxies are point rather than extended
detections in the Herschel data. Thus ‘by-eye’ inspection to reject
background sources is more ambiguous than it was for the HeViCS
and HeFoCS. However, the comparatively large survey area allows
us to use a ‘Monte-Carlo’ method to model the expected contam-
ination for a given FIR-optical source separation. We will assume
that if extended emission is detected at the location of an optical
Coma galaxy it is a reliable detection. Consequently, the follow-
ing discussion only applies to the point-source population, which
is ∼60 % of the total detections at 250 µm.

As was done for HeViCS and HeFoCS we impose a strict cri-
terion that a galaxy must be detected at 250 µm to be included as a
Herschel FIR detection - 250 µm provides the best combination of
sensitivity and resolution (see below). Thus, we estimate the con-
tamination at 250 µm. We have done this by comparing the mea-
sured separation between an optically detected galaxy in our cata-
logue and a FIR detected source, with that for a random catalogue
of equal size.

We have computed the distance from the optical source to the
nearest FIR neighbour using the North Galactic Point Source Cata-
logue (NGSPSC)7. The white diagonally hatched histogram in the
upper panel of Figure 5 shows the distribution of nearest neigh-
bour separations. Clearly quite a lot of CCC/CFC optically selected

the PSF of the Herschel beam and will not be representative of the extend
of dust in the galaxy.

Figure 5. The above shows the results of our simulations and our method for
estimating possible contamination by background sources at 250 µm. The
clear hatched histogram in the upper panel shows the distribution of angu-
lar separations of optically detected CCC/CFC galaxies from their nearest
FIR detected neighbour. The blue histogram in the upper panel (most eas-
ily seen in the bottom right hand corner) shows the mean distribution of
our simulations of a random catalogue of galaxies. The lower panel shows
the contamination for each bin of angular separation. The red line is a third
order polynomial ﬁtted to the data using a χ2 minimisation technique.

galaxies have a FIR source within ∼2 arc sec. We have then repeat
this process, using a catalogue of equal length to the CCC/CFC,
but with random positions on the sky. In order to minimise the er-
ror in this latter step we repeat this random catalogue generation
and cross-match many (∼ 106) times. The random-NGPSC separa-
tion distance distribution is shown as a blue histogram in the upper
panel of Figure 5 - it is a little difﬁcult to see because the numbers
are small over these angular separations, but this does indicate that
contamination is not a major problem - the association of optical
and FIR sources is clearly very different if the optical galaxies are
laid down at random. Combining the above two results, the lower
panel of Figure 5 shows the percentage contamination in our cata-
logue for each bin of angular separation. We have then ﬁtted a third
order polynomial using a χ2 minimisation technique and calculated
the angular separation where the contamination is equal to 5 %, we
ﬁnd this to be at ∼ 4 arc seconds. Given that our pixel size at 250
µm is 6 arc sec we are essentially requiring that the far infrared
source position corresponds with the optical source position to plus
or minus one 250 µm pixel.

2.6 Flux Veriﬁcation

In order to verify our automated FIR source measurement process
we cross match and compare our measured ﬂuxes with FIR data
from the literature. The result is shown in Figure 6 with gradi-
ents and intercepts tabulated in Table 2. We matched our catalogue
with the IRAS point source catalogue (Helou & Walker 1988), the
IRAS faint source catalogue (Conrow et al. 1993), Hickinbottom
et al. (2014) a deep Herschel PACS survey of the Coma cluster

Markers are as follows; IRAS faint source catalogue (Conrow et al. 1993),

core, and with the NGPSC data. Table 2 shows overall that the re-
sults are consistent with a gradient of unity and an intercept of zero.
However, the faintest (<50 mJy) matched sources from Hickinbot-
tom et al. (2014) appear brighter than the ﬂux recorded at 100 and
160 µm in our catalogue. These sources were all recorded at ﬂuxes
below the 3σ global noise limit of the NGP PACS maps. After ex-
tensive testing by both ourselves and Hickinbottom et al. we have
placed a further criterion for a source to be detected in the PACS
bands i.e. we require all PACS sources to have a ﬂux density greater
than 3× the global measured noise in the NGP PACS maps before

3 SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION FITTING

As in Davies et al. (2012) we have ﬁtted a modiﬁed blackbody to
every galaxy detected in all ﬁve Herschel bands (198 galaxies) us-
ing the following function:

Sλ =

κabs(λ )MdustB(λ ,Tdust )

D2

(1)

where Sλ is the ﬂux density at wavelength λ , Mdust is the dust mass,
Tdust is the dust temperature, B(λ ,Tdust ) is the Planck function, D
is the distance to the cluster (105 Mpc) and κabs is the dust ab-
sorption coefﬁcient. The latter follows a power law modiﬁed by an
emissivity (β ), such that:

(cid:18) λ0

(cid:19)β

λ

κabs(λ ) = κabs(λ0)×

(2)

We assume that emission at these wavelengths is purely ther-
mal and from dust at a single temperature with a ﬁxed β = 2 emis-
sivity (Davies et al. 2012). We use κabs(350 µm) = 0.192 m2 kg−1
according to Draine (2003). The above function is ﬁtted using a χ2
minimisation technique.

Although this is most likely an overly simplistic analysis,
this approach has been used in previous works (Davies et al.
2010, 2012; Smith et al. 2012; Auld et al. 2013; Verstappen et al.
2013) and shown to ﬁt the data very well in the FIR/sub-mm
regime. Bianchi (2013) showed that using a single component mod-
iﬁed blackbody returns equivalent results to more complex models
such as those described in Draine & Li (2007). From our ﬁts we
obtain dust masses and temperatures. Spectral energy distribution
data and modiﬁed blackbody ﬁts are shown in Appendix D and 250
µm images in Appendix C of the Monthly Notices of the Royal As-
tronomical Society on-line material.

photometric surveys, which provides not only the positions, magni-
tudes, sizes and shapes as used above, but also star formation rates
(SFR), stellar mass and metallicity for a signiﬁcant fraction of our
detected objects. We will also take advantage of available atomic
gas data.

4.1 Stellar Mass, Star Formation Rate and Metallicity

Brinchmann et al. (2004) (see also Kauffmann et al. (2003) and
Tremonti et al. (2004) who have carried out photometry and spec-
tral analysis respectively for the same sample) have used SDSS
spectra and optical colours to calculate stellar mass8, SFR and gas
phase metallicities for galaxies that reside in the NGP area. Below
we will use this data as part of our analysis of the galaxies in our
FIR sample. Brinchmann et al. (2004) designate a galaxy as either
having emission lines or not. For galaxies without emission lines
stellar masses and SFRs are calculated using the optical colours and
the 4000 ˚A break in the SDSS spectra. However, galaxies without
emission lines do not have measured metallicities. In Table 3 we
indicate the number of galaxies in the CCC/CFC with and without
measured metallicities - morphologies are deﬁned in section 4.3.

4.2 Atomic Hydrogen

We have cross-matched the CCC/CFC with data collected
by Gavazzi et al. (2006) and for galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy
Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array Survey (ALFALFA) (Haynes et al.
2011). Gavazzi et al. (2006) used the Arecibo radio telescope to ob-
serve 35 spiral galaxies in the Coma supercluster. They also added
all data then available in the literature, giving 92 galaxies in total.
The ALFALFA 0.4α data (Haynes et al. 2011) adds a further 138
galaxies to this. So, in total we have atomic hydrogen data for 230
CCC/CFC galaxies. Where we have a measurement from both the
literature and from ALFALFA we have taken the value from AL-
FALFA 0.4α. In Table 3 we give the numbers of galaxies detected
in HI of each morphological type (see below) in the cluster and
ﬁlament.

4.3 Morphology

The larger distance of the Coma cluster makes morphological clas-
siﬁcation far more ambiguous, especially for the fainter members
of the CCC/CFC, than that for both Virgo and Fornax galaxies.
The Galaxy Zoo project (Lintott et al. 2008) covers the majority
of the SDSS DR7 galaxies that are included in the spectroscopic
sample. They invite members of the general public to decide if a
galaxy is either an elliptical or spiral. Based on these votes each
galaxy can then be assigned a probability of being elliptical p(E)
or spiral p(S). This allows us to deﬁne 3 morphological categories;
early, p(E)>0.8; late, p(S)>0.8 and uncertain where p(E)<0.8
and p(S)<0.8. We will discuss the signiﬁcance of these morpho-
logical categories below.

The GOLDMINE database (Gavazzi et al. 2003) provides
multi-wavelength data from a number of sources, with varying lev-
els of completeness. As part of the GOLDMINE database Gavazzi

ous Fornax (Fuller et al. 2014) and Virgo (Davies et al. 2014) papers we
have adjusted the SDSS stellar masses by +0.15 dex to converted from the
Kroupa IMF (Kroupa 2002) to a ‘diet’ Salpeter IMF (Bell et al. 2003) as
per the recipes in Brinchmann et al. (2004).

4.4 Local density

In order to examine the affect of local structure or environment
rather than large scale structure such as the cluster and ﬁlament, we
simply use the Nth nearest neighbour statistic (ΣN) as deﬁned by
the equation

ΣN =

N
πD2
N

(3)

to measure the local density of optically selected CCC/CFC galax-
ies. ΣN is the surface density out to the Nth nearest neighbour that
lies at a distance DN. As we assume that all our galaxies are at
∼100 Mpc we effectively ‘collapse’ our catalogues of cluster and
ﬁlament galaxies into a 2D plane and measure spatial distances on
the sky.

We have calculated ΣN for the 1st, 5th and 10th nearest neigh-
bours for each galaxy. In order to avoid edge effects for this anal-
ysis, we have drawn our sample from a greater area than the NGP
Herschel ﬁeld, but with our original velocity selection for the clus-
ter and ﬁlament.

Figure 9 illustrates the merit of each ΣN statistic and what
scale of environment it traces. Σ10 effectively smooths over the
largest spatial scale and is sensitive to the larger scale structures.
Conversely, Σ1 and Σ5 are sensitive to a galaxy’s more immediate
environment. As expected all ΣN statistics are highest in the cluster
core. However, Figure 9 shows that within the ﬁlament there are a
number of higher density regions that can probably be associated
with small groups of galaxies.

5 FAR-INFRARED RESULTS
5.1 Detection rates

Our Coma and ﬁlament far-infrared data is obtained from the posi-
tions of optically selected galaxies in the CCC/CFC. This is not
ideal as we would prefer for our analysis to select galaxies via
their far-infrared ﬂux density. The problem of course is identify-
ing which far-infrared sources belong to the cluster and which are
in the background. Figure 10 shows the distribution of optical mag-
nitudes in the SDSS r band for all CCC/CFC (black) galaxies com-
pared to just those detected at 250 µm in the Herschel data (cyan).
We do not detect any galaxies in the far-infrared fainter than r =
17.5, which is below the limit of our optical selection. So, from
this our expectation is that a deeper optical catalogue would not
signiﬁcantly increase the numbers of FIR detections in our current
data. However, there is still of course the possibility of sources with
unusual ratios of optical to far-infrared emission that are detected
in the cluster/ﬁlament by Herschel, but are too faint to appear in the
optical catalogue.

This is an issue we have investigated before for the Virgo
(Davies et al. 2012) and Fornax clusters (Fuller et al. 2014). Our
conclusion was that there is no evidence for a signiﬁcant population
of far-infrared sources missed by our optical selection. We have car-
ried out a similar analysis here and come to the same conclusion.
Our method is fully described in Davies et al. (2012), but brieﬂy
we compare the 250 µm number counts in an area away from the
cluster with those over the cluster region, in this case within the
Virial radius (see Fig 11). Although we are dealing with large num-
bers in the background compared to those in the cluster we ﬁnd
no evidence for an excess population in the cluster ﬁeld. The black
line in Fig 11 are the counts for an eastern quadrant of the NGP
ﬁeld where contamination by foreground (ﬁlament) galaxies is at

& Boselli (1996) catalogued galaxies in the Coma region. They are
complete for galaxies in the B band brighter than mB = 15.5, cov-
ering a large - although not total - fraction of the NGP survey area.
They visually classify galaxy morphologies into the more familiar
Hubble types (E through to Sd). However the brighter magnitude
limit and reduced area coverage means that only 256 (15 %) galax-
ies are in both GOLDMINE and our CCC/CFC catalogues.

The Galaxy Zoo catalogue has been shown to be consis-
tent with classiﬁcations of the same galaxies by professional as-
tronomers (Lintott et al. 2008). However, Lintott et al. (2008) also
show that fainter galaxies are harder to classify and more-likely to
be classiﬁed as an early-type or uncertain-type. In order to under-
stand our three morphological groups, based upon the above se-
lection, we compare our classiﬁcation with that of GOLDMINE -
Fig. 7.

Fig. 7 clearly shows that at the distance of Coma, Galaxy Zoo
is a good predictor of morphology when compared to GOLDMINE.
Early-types with a 0.8 likely-hood selection are mainly composed
of E and S0’s (∼ 98 %), only one early-type is in the S0/Sa bin.
Late-type galaxies are mainly composed of Sa to Sc’s types. How-
ever, 8 galaxies are classiﬁed late-type by Galaxy Zoo and early-
type by GOLDMINE. In order to understand this we have visu-
ally inspected these galaxies (see Figure 8). Four of these galaxies
(CCC 232, CCC 513, CFC 57, and CFC 344) are clearly edge-on
galaxies, and as such morphological classiﬁcation is always am-
biguous. The remaining four galaxies are clearly late-types and so
appear to be miss-classiﬁed in GOLDMINE.

Figure 7 also helps us understand the morphological make up
of the uncertain-type. The uncertain-type covers a range of mor-
phologies from E to Sc however, it is mostly made up of S0 and
S0/Sa galaxies.

shows the counts from within the cluster Virial radius, these counts
only exceed the ’background’ at bright ﬂux densities due to the

the Herschel data. The SPIRE 250 µm band has the highest detec-
tion rate, something that has previously been noted by Auld et al.
(2013) and Fuller et al. (2014) in Virgo and Fornax, respectively.
This is due to a combination of instrument sensitivity and the typi-
cal shape of a galaxy’s SED. Consequently, we will use the 250 µm
band observations extensively in the below analysis and discussion.
At 250 µm we detect 99 of 774 (13 %) of galaxies in the cluster and
422 of 951 (44 %) of galaxies in the ﬁlament - a signiﬁcant differ-
ence and of course primarily due to the very different morphologi-
cal mix (Table 3).

In order to better understand the properties of the galax-
ies we detect we can estimate the limiting dust mass required

for a detection at 250 µm. The lowest detected 250 µm ﬂux
in our FIR catalogue is ∼ 15 mJy. Assuming a dust tempera-
ture of 20 K (see below) the corresponding limiting dust mass
is log10(Mdust /M(cid:12)) = 6.1. If we assume that a typical late-type
galaxy has a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of log10(Mdust /Mstars) =
−3 (Cortese 2012) then we should detect all galaxies with stel-
lar masses of log10(Mstars/M(cid:12)) > 9.1. According to Brinchmann

light ratio appropriate for a 13.6 Gyr old stellar population with an

distance of Coma is also log10(Mstars/M(cid:12)) ≈ 9.0.

Table 5 shows the detection rate for each morphological type
(as deﬁned above using Galaxy Zoo) within both the cluster and
ﬁlament. As expected late-type galaxies have the highest detection
rate in both cluster and ﬁlament (of order 50 %). Conversely early-
type galaxies have the lowest detection rate (of order 10 %). Both
early and late-type detection rates are statically identical between
the two samples, whereas, uncertain-type galaxies have far lower
detection rates inside the cluster environment (9 % and 35 % for
the cluster and ﬁlament, respectively). Far fewer morphologically
uncertain (S0/Sa?) galaxies are detected in the far-infrared in the
cluster compared to the ﬁeld, suggesting that their star formation
has been switched off in the cluster, but that their morphology has
been unaffected.

For each morphological type we have compared the positions
and velocities of the far-infrared detected and undetected galaxies
(Figures 12). The left panels black and coloured markers indicate
the spatial position of each galaxy. The dash black circle in the left-
hand panel marks the Virial radius of the cluster. The right-hand
panels show histograms of radial velocity. For each histogram of
√
velocity we have ﬁtted a Gaussian using χ2 minimisation, where
N galaxies per bin, the purple and grey histograms rep-
errors are
resent ﬁts to the detected and undetected galaxies respectively. We
have listed the average projected cluster radius for detected and
undetected galaxies in the cluster as well as the derived velocity
dispersions in Table 6.

All three morphological types have velocity dispersions that
are statistically identical for FIR detected and undetected galax-
ies. All the velocity dispersion are also statically identical to the
overall velocity dispersion (∼ 900 km s−1) of the cluster. If any of
the morphological populations had a velocity dispersion that was
greater than that of the cluster as a whole it would imply that it was
less relaxed and thus probably far later in joining the cluster. The
fact that all our morphological types show no evidence of a differ-
ent velocity dispersion implies that they have been in the cluster
longer than a crossing time of a few Gyr. This is longer than the
gas stripping timescale even for the most massive galaxies (Boselli
& Gavazzi 2006).

With regard to position in the cluster, as expected late-
type galaxies have the largest average projected cluster radius
(0.55 Rvirial). Conversly early-type galaxies have the smallest aver-
age projected cluster radius (0.37 Rvirial). Both late and early-type
galaxies show no difference in mean radius between FIR detected
and undetected galaxies (<2σ). Uncertain-type galaxies are the
only sample that shows any signiﬁcant difference in spatial position
when selected by their far-infrared properties (0.4 and 0.6Rvirial for
detected and undetected galaxies respectively). This is somewhat
counter intuitive, with the detected galaxies having an average spa-
tial position closer to the cluster centre than those not detected.

There are 521 CCC/CFC galaxies detected in the far-infrared at
250 µm, but not all of these are detected in all ﬁve Herschel bands.
For the 198 galaxies detected in all ﬁve bands we have ﬁtted their
SEDs with single temperature modiﬁed blackbody curves using
β = 2. The average χ2 goodness of ﬁt value for the entire sam-
ple is < χ2
do f =3 < 7.8, corresponds with
a conﬁdence level of 95 %) indicating that for the majority of the
sample the SEDs are well ﬁtted. 7 galaxies have χ2
do f =3 > 7.8 indi-
cating that a single temperature component may not be sufﬁcient to
model their FIR emission. In appendix C (see of the Monthly No-
tices of the Royal Astronomical Society on-line material) we show
the SEDs and modiﬁed black body ﬁts for each galaxy. Histograms
of dust mass, dust-to-stellar mass and dust temperatures produced
from the SED ﬁtting process are shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13 shows that detected late-type galaxies have dust
masses ranging from log10(Mdust/M(cid:12)) = 7.0 to 8.3 and tempera-
tures of 16.0 to 25.5 K, with mean values of log10(Mdust/M(cid:12)) =
7.63 ± 0.02 and 20.0± 0.1 K. Uncertain-type galaxies have dust
masses ranging from log10(Mdust/M(cid:12)) = 6.7 to 8.3 and temper-
atures of 16.2 to 28.7 K, with mean values of log10(Mdust/M(cid:12)) =
7.33± 0.04 and 21.7± 0.5 K. Early-types have a narrower range of
dust masses of log10(Mdust/M(cid:12)) = 6.9 to 7.5 and temperatures of
16.2 to 26.0 K, with mean values of log10(Mdust/M(cid:12)) = 7.3± 0.04
and 21.0± 0.2 K. This observed warmer dust temperature for early
type galaxies has previously been observed in both the Virgo
(Davies et al. 2014) and Fornax (Fuller et al. 2014) clusters and
may be due to additional heating by hot x-ray gas.
CCC/CFC galaxies have mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios of
log10(Mdust /Mstars) = -3.6± 0.04, -2.93± 0.01 and -2.75± 0.01
for early, uncertain and late-types, respectively. As expected from
our previous results for Virgo and Fornax (Auld et al. 2013; Fuller
et al. 2014), late-types have richer and cooler dust reservoirs, and
early-types have a relatively depleted and warmer ISM.

In Table 7 we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two sample test
(K-S) to make a more quantitative comparison between the clus-
ter and ﬁlament’s early, uncertain and late-type galaxy populations
with respect to dust mass, dust-to-stars ratio, and dust temperature.
The K-S test shows that for a given morphological type the FIR
properties of galaxies in the cluster and ﬁlament are statistically
very similar with the one obvious exception of early type galaxy
dust temperatures, early-types have hotter dust temperatures in the
cluster environment. Just why this occurs is not clear, though it
is possible it has something to do with the cluster x-ray gas. The
above results suggest however, that on the whole the different envi-
ronments have had very little effect on the dust properties of their
constituent galaxies.

We have also used (Table 7) H I -defﬁciency values calculated
for 70 galaxies from Gavazzi et al. (2006) to compare galaxies
that are H I -normal (H I -def. (cid:62) 0.5) with H I -deﬁcient (H I -def.
< 0.5) - these galaxies are exclusively late-type. A K-S test shows
that H I -normal and H I -deﬁcient galaxies are statically identical
with respect to dust mass and temperature. However, with respect
to dust-to-stellar mass ratio H I -normal and H I -deﬁcient galaxies
are unlikely to be drawn from the same distribution. Galaxies that
are depleted in HI are also depleted in dust (Cortese 2012). Gavazzi
et al. (2006) has previously showed that H I -deﬁciency decreases
with cluster centric distance with the most H I -deﬁcient galaxies
at the cluster centre. The implication is that H I -deﬁciency traces
those galaxies most strongly affected by the ram pressure stripping
of gas within the cluster environment. The above result - that galax-

ies have different dust-to-stellar mass ratios when separated by H I -
deﬁciency - shows that this physical process can affect both the
atomic gas and dust properties of typical late-type galaxies. This
result is not new having been shown previously by Cortese et al.
(2010) - they showed that the radial extent of dust was truncated
for H I -deﬁcient galaxies.

5.3 Chemical Evolution

Given that we have for a sub-sample of our galaxies measures of the
mass of gas (atomic) and metals (both in dust and the gas phase)
we can consider and compare the chemical evolution of cluster and
ﬁlament galaxies. We have 80 ﬁlament and 18 cluster galaxies for
which both HI and gas phase metallicity values are available.

Edmunds (1990) shows that a galaxy’s metallicity ZTotal =
Mmetals/Mgas is related to the gas fraction ( f = Mgas/(Mstars +
Mmetals + Mgas)) in the following way ZTotal (cid:54) pln(1/ f ), where
the equality applies to the closed box model i.e. one in which there
are no additional inﬂows or outﬂows of gas after the galaxy has
formed. p is the stellar yield, which is the fractional mass of met-
als per unit mass of gas freshly formed in nucleosynthesis. Ed-
munds (1990) deﬁnes the effective yield as pe f f = ZTotal
ln(1/ f ) i.e. the
derived yield regardless of inﬂow or outﬂow. Essentially p depends
on physical processes in the interior of stars and the stellar initial
mass function, while pe f f has an additional dependence on the in-
ﬂow or outﬂow of gas either pristine or metal enriched (Davies et al.
2014). We can see if cluster galaxies have a different value of pe f f
to ﬁlament galaxies so indicating that their star forming history has
been affected by the cluster environment.

In order to calculate the total gas mass of each galaxy we must
take account of all the other major gas phases; molecular hydro-
gen, helium and the gas in the warm and hot components. Davies
et al. (2014) estimate that MTotal
Gas = 2.5MHI for galaxies in the Virgo
cluster. This is derived from the measured HI mass, the mean ratio
of molecular to atomic gas, the abundance of helium and the gas
in the warm and hot components. We use this relation to adjust our

Figure 14. The derived metallicity (taking account of both metals in dust
and the gaseous phases) against ln(1/ f ), where f is the gas fraction. Red
and blue markers are used for cluster and ﬁlament galaxies, with red, blue
and black lines being lines ﬁtted to the cluster, ﬁlament and overall samples,
respectively. The gradients of these lines are equal to the effective yield
pe f f .

H I masses to take account of all phases of the gaseous inter-stellar
medium.

Again following Davies et al. (2014) we estimate the total
mass in metals to be MMetals = 1.2ZGasMHI + MDust. ZGas is de-
rived from the Oxygen abundance (12.0 + log10(O/H)(cid:12)). Asplund
& Garc´ıa P´erez (2001) give the solar oxygen abundance as 12.0
+ log10(O/H)(cid:12) = 8.69 and Z(cid:12) = 0.014, this allows us to convert
oxygen abundance (O/H) to total metallicity in the gas phase (Zgas)
using the relation Zgas= 29.2(O/H), this assumes solar abundance
ratios. However, this does not account for the metals in the warm
and hot phases of the ISM. Davies et al. (2014) use the work of
Gupta et al. (2012) and estimate that the mass of metals in the hot
and warm phases of the ISM to be 0.2ZgasMHI, giving MMetals =
1.2zgasMHI + MDust. The ‘total’ metallicity (ZTotal) is then calcu-
lated from both the gaseous and dusty interstellar medium, deﬁned
as; ZTotal = MMetals/MTotal
Gas

.

As an aside we ﬁnd that the mean mass fraction of metals in
the dust is 0.4± 0.1, which agrees with previous estimates of 0.5
by Meyer et al. (1998) and Whittet (1992). Davies et al. (2014)
performed the same analysis for galaxies in the Virgo cluster and
found a value of 0.50± 0.02

In Figure 14 we plot the total metallicity (ZTotal) against the
logarithm of the reciprocal of the gas fraction (ln(1/ f )). The red
and blue markers and lines represent cluster and ﬁlament galaxies,
respectively. We ﬁt a linear relation with a y-axis intercept of 0, the
gradient of this line is the effective yield (pe f f ). The effective yield
of the cluster and ﬁlament are 0.017,± 0.01 and 0.019± 0.01, re-
spectively. Thus the two are statically identical. The black line is a
ﬁt to all the galaxies and gives an effective yield of 0.018± 0.01.
The galaxies appear well ﬁtted by a linear relation. In terms of a
chemical evolution model galaxies in the Coma cluster appear iden-
tical to galaxies in the ﬁlament - there is no evidence that the cluster
galaxies, for example, have been stripped of gas and so ’locking in’
a ﬁxed metalicity at a low gas fraction.

Contrary to our inference from Figure 14 there has previously
been presented some evidence that galaxies in different environ-
ments may have evolved differently. Skillman et al. (1996) consid-
ered 9 galaxies in the Virgo cluster, which they then divided into 3
groups of 3 deﬁned by their HI deﬁciency, which also distinguished
them by their location in the cluster - the more gas rich galaxies re-
siding in the cluster periphery. They found that these HI rich galax-
ies had lower metalicities than those with higher HI deﬁciencies
and concluded that this was because they were still able to accrete
metal poor gas. However, Skillman et al.’s work relied upon a very
small sample size. A much larger sample has recently been consid-
ered by Hughes et al. (2013). They considered 260 galaxies from
a wide range of environments from isolated to again Virgo cluster
galaxies. They conﬁrm Skillman et al.’s result that HI rich galax-
ies tend to have lower metalicities than those with more normal HI
masses. We differ in what we have done compared to both Skill-
man et al. and Hughes et al. in that we do not have a measure of
HI deﬁciency, instead we distinguish cluster and ﬁlament galaxies
only by their location. We also use an estimate of the total met-
alicity (including dust) rather than just the (O/H) gas abundance
and also make an estimate of the total gas mass rather than just the
atomic hydrogen. However, Hughes et al. do conclude that inter-
nal evolutionary processes are more important than environmental
effects.

6 TRENDS WITH DENSITY
In this section we will consider how dust-to-stars9 and gas-to-stars
ratios, sSFR10, stellar mass and morphological mix depend on local
galaxy density (Σ1, Σ5, Σ10, and projected cluster radius). We will
also make use of the galaxy zoo morphological classiﬁcations in a
slightly different way. Using the probability weightings described
earlier (p(S) for a spiral and p(E) for an elliptical) we now deﬁne
a new parameter (Φ), where Φ = p(S)− p(E). This is a new non-
integer way of describing a galaxy’s morphology, where values of
Φ (cid:39) 1 and -1 are expected for a deﬁnite late (spiral) and early type
galaxy. As part of our trends with density analysis we will now
deﬁne early type galaxies as those with negative Φ and late types
as those with positive Φ. Our results are summarised in Fig. 15

For each parameter in Fig. 15 we have used evenly spaced
bins over the logarithmic density range for each morphological type
(early and late). Each point is the mean value in the bin with the
circle size purely a relative measure of the number of galaxies in
each bin. The error bar is the standard deviation in the bin divided
by the square root of the number of galaxies in that bin. If a bin has
less than 3 galaxies in it is discounted and neither plotted or ﬁtted.
For each morphological type, parameter vs density plot, we have
ﬁtted a straight line (e.g. y = mx +C), using a χ2 minimisation. We
test whether or not each ﬁt is consistent with a change with density
(i.e. m (cid:54)= 0).

For each parameter and morphological type we have calcu-
lated from Fig. 15 the number of density tracers that are consistent
with a change with density (m (cid:54)= 0 with a signiﬁcance greater than
3σ). If all 4 density tracers are consistent with a change with den-
sity then it is designated as having a ‘Strong’ change. If 2 or 3
density tracers are consistent with a change with density then it is
designated as having a ‘Moderate’ change. If only 1 density tracer
is consistent with a change with density then it is designated as
having a ‘Weak’ change. Finally, if no density tracers are consis-
tent with a change with density then it is designated as having ‘No’
change. Clearly the different measures of density should apply over
different spatial scales, but as is clear from Figure 15 trends in the
data are apparent independent of the density scale used. Table 8
lists each parameter and how strong (if at all) any change with den-
sity is. The bottom line is that there is pretty good evidence that
late type galaxies do change their properties dependent on the local
environment, but that early type galaxies do not.

Clearly the gas-to-stars ratio of late type galaxies is strongly
affected by the local density (Fig. 15). This is consistent with the
idea, discussed above, that gas is stripped from galaxies as they
move through the cluster environment. Those galaxies residing in
the highest density environments and/or at the smallest projected
radii from the cluster centre being most affected by the gas loss.
Alternately rather than gas loss the gas may have been more efﬁ-
ciently converted into stars. Fig. 15 also clearly shows that stellar
mass is increasing with environmental density actually supporting
the second alternative that gas has been taken up into stars at a faster
rate in the denser cluster environments.

We can also investigate the morphology-density relation us-

9 For galaxies that are detected at 250 µm, but could not be ﬁtted with a
SED because they had too few other data points, we have estimated their
dust mass using the 250 µm ﬂux density and a ﬁxed dust temperature of
20 K. This lets us add a further 323 galaxies to our sample, yielding a total
sample of 521 galaxies with dust masses in both the ﬁlament and cluster.

Red and blue markers and lines are for early and late-type galaxies, respectively. Each point indicates a given density bin’s mean value, and its size represents
the relative number of galaxies in each bin. Each line is ﬁtted using a χ2 minimisation technique.

density tracers are consistent with a change (m (cid:54)= 0) then; N=4, Strong; N=2

ing our new measure of morphology Φ. In Figure 16 we have cal-
culated the change of Φ with all four environmental tracers. Φ is
strongly affected by galaxy density even over the scales measured
by Σ1 - so if you have a near neighbour (10s to a 100 kpc away) of
similar mass (we only have a small range of stellar masses in our
sample, see Fig. 15) you are more likely to be of an earlier type. In-
terestingly Φ is approximately equal to zero just about at the cluster
Virial radius.

7 MASS DISTRIBUTIONS

In order to understand how the baryonic components of galaxies
change as a whole between the cluster and ﬁlament we have cre-
ated stars, gas and dust mass distributions (Fig. 17). To do this we
have had to make some assumptions. Firstly, we have no informa-
tion about the precise distance to individual galaxies so we assume
that they are all, whether in the cluster or ﬁlament at the same dis-
tance as the cluster (105 Mpc). Secondly, ideally we would like to
select by stellar mass to create the stellar mass function, atomic hy-
drogen mass for the gas mass function and dust mass for the dust
mass function. In reality we have a complex selection of SDSS r
band magnitude of 17.8 for the stars, this plus a varied 21cm de-
tection limit for the gas and the SDSS plus Herschel limit for the
dust - this is why we will refer to what we derive as mass distribu-
tions rather than mass functions. Thirdly, the volumes to use to get
densities are rather difﬁcult to determinate. With these provisos we
will concentrate on the bright end of the mass functions, where we
might hope to have completeness and on the general shape of the

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

mass distributions rather than their difﬁcult to determine normali-
sations11.

To get some rough feel for the numbers involved we estimated
the volume of the cluster as a sphere with a Virial radius of 3.1 Mpc
and hence a volume of ∼125 Mpc3. Estimating the volume of the
ﬁlament is not so straightforward because it is not a Virialised re-
gion, in the same sense as the cluster, and so does not have a well
deﬁned size. To make a crude comparison we have assumed that the
ﬁlament is a sheet of depth 6 Mpc (∼2×RComa
Virial) with a cross sec-
tional area the same as the area covered by the NGP ﬁeld at a dis-
tance of 105 Mpc (23.4 ×21.7 Mpc). We then subtract the volume
of the cluster from this region yielding a volume for the ﬁlament of
2873 Mpc3.

We have ﬁtted the below Schechter function (given in terms of
linear rather than logarithmic units) to each of the data sets shown

11 To over come this problem to some extent we do not ﬁt the lowest mass
point for either stellar or gas mass distributions. For our dust mass data
we can be a little more conﬁdent. As stated above our dust mass limit is
log10(Mdust /M(cid:12)) ≈ 6.4 and so we ﬁt all data above this limit.

calculated the mass density of each component from the derived
best ﬁtting function values, see Table 9.

The stellar mass shown in the left panel of Figure 17 is prob-
ably the best constrained of all three mass distributions as it is de-
rived from the complete optical sample. As noted above the best ﬁt
Schechter parameter φ is set arbitrarily by the choice of volume,
but using our values the cluster is about twenty times more dense
than the ﬁlament (Table 9). The data in Table 9 also indicates that
Coma is some three times more dense that Virgo and that the ﬁl-
ament is about ﬁfty times more dense than the general ﬁeld (see
references given in the caption to Table 9). M∗ and α the so called
‘characteristic mass’ and ‘faint end slope’, are both independent
of volume and thus interesting to compare. However, the values of
M∗ and α for the cluster and ﬁlament samples are consistent (<1σ)
with each other and with Virgo and the general ﬁeld. From this data
there is no evidence that the environment has had any inﬂuence on
the relative numbers of galaxies with different stellar masses.

The atomic mass distributions are shown in the central panel
of Figure 17. This is the poorest constrained of the three mass dis-
tributions as it represents the smallest fraction of the optical sam-
ple (58 and 172 galaxies in the cluster and ﬁlament, respectively).
Again, with the provisos on volumes, Coma is about 6 times more
dense in atomic gas than the ﬁlament - compared to the stars the
gas is depleted in Coma. Most notable is the steepness of the ﬁeld
galaxy atomic gas mass distribution compared to Coma, ﬁlament
and Virgo. The values of M∗ and α for the cluster and ﬁlament
samples are consistent (<1σ) with each other, but the ﬁtting errors
are large because of the small numbers.

The dust mass distribution is shown in the rightmost panel
of Figure 17 and is reasonably well constrained as it represents a

signiﬁcant fraction of the optical sample (88 and 379 galaxies in
the cluster and ﬁlament, respectively). Most notable is the large gas
to dust ratio of the ﬁlament. Again, the values of M∗ and α for the
cluster and ﬁlament samples are consistent (<1σ) with each other
and with Virgo and the ﬁeld.

We can take the mass densities (ρ) from Table 9 and create ra-
tios that are usefully independent of the volume used. We have cre-
ated one for each of the four environments (Coma, ﬁlament, Virgo,
and the ﬁeld), see Table 10.

The Coma, ﬁlament and Virgo environments are all stat-
ically the same (Table 10) in terms of log10(ρgas/ρstars) and
log10(ρdust /ρstars), with the exception of log10(ρgas/ρstars) in the
ﬁeld - the ﬁeld is much more gas rich than any of the other three
environments. However, all four environments are statistically the
same with regard to log10(ρdust /ρstars). These results again imply
that gas is affected by higher density environments much more so
than the other signiﬁcant component of the interstellar medium,
dust. We have ordered the mass density ratios in Table 10 from
lowest to highest and they correspond to what we might have ex-
pected with the possible exception of the ordering of the ﬁlament
and Virgo environments.

Given that we have calculated the baryonic mass densities
of the Coma cluster (in galaxies) we can also calculate the total
mass of each component using our above estimate of its volume
(125 Mpc3). As we have also measured the velocity dispersion of

Where MVirial, RVirial, σ, and G are the Virial mass, Virial ra-

Table 11 we compare the measured baryonic mass of material in
galaxies with the total dynamical mass of the cluster. The overall
ratio of dynamical mass to baryonic mass (excluding the x-ray gas)
of the cluster is ∼ 104.

8 SUMMARY

We have undertaken a Herschel far infrared survey of the Coma
cluster and the galaxy ﬁlament it resides within. Our survey covers
an area of ∼150 deg2 observed in ﬁve bands at 100, 160, 250, 350
and 500 µm. We have used the SDSS spectroscopic survey to deﬁne
an area and redshift selected sample of 744 Coma cluster galaxies -
the Coma Cluster Catalogue (CCC). For comparison we also deﬁne
in a similar way a sample of 951 galaxies in the connecting ﬁlament
- the Coma Filament Catalogue (CFC).

We have used the optical positions and parameters of these
CCC and CFC galaxies to deﬁne appropriate apertures to measure
their far infrared emission. We have detected 99 of 744 (13 %) and
422 of 951 (44 %) of the cluster and ﬁlament galaxies in the SPIRE
250 µm band, which we use for our initial far infrared selection.
We have carried out simulations to ensure that our process of asso-
ciating far infrared and optical sources leads to less than 5% mis-
identiﬁed objects.

In order to better understand the global detection rates we
have separated the cluster and ﬁlament galaxies into 3 morpholog-
ical categories using the Galaxy Zoo data: early, p(E)>0.8; late,
p(S)>0.8 and uncertain where p(E)<0.8 and p(S)<0.8. We exam-
ined the detection rate for each morphological group in the 250 µm
band as it has the highest detection rate of all the Herschel bands.
Early and late-type galaxies have the same relative detection rates
in the cluster and ﬁlament, but overall the fraction of galaxies de-
tected in the cluster is lower because of the morphological mix.
The relative detection rates of our ’uncertain’ types (S0/Sa?) is no-
ticeably different between the ﬁlament (higher rate) and the cluster
(lower rate). This is one of the few clear measurements of a differ-
ence between the ﬁlament and cluster environment.

We compare the cluster velocity dispersions of detected and
undetected late, uncertain and early-type galaxies. We found that all
morphological types have velocity dispersions statically identical
to each other and the overall cluster value. This implies that all
morphological types have been in the cluster longer than a crossing
time and hence longer than the timescale for ram pressure stripping
- the two of which are comparable.

Coma cluster galaxies

21

For galaxies detected in all ﬁve far infrared bands we ﬁt a mod-
iﬁed blackbody with a ﬁxed emissivity index of β = 2, giving dust
masses and temperatures for 198 galaxies. As expected early-type
galaxies show lower dust masses than late-type galaxies, but they
tend to have hotter dust temperatures. When comparing the far in-
frared properties of galaxies in Coma and the ﬁlament we ﬁnd that
they are statistically identical with the exception of the hotter tem-
peratures of early type cluster galaxies.

Combining our data with that from the literature we estimate
the total gas mass as well as the mass in metals (in the gas phase
and in the dust) for a sub-sample of Coma and ﬁlament galaxies.
We ﬁnd no evidence for a difference in the effective yields of these
two populations. This implies that neither population has been sub-
jected to gas loss or infall to a greater or lesser extent than the other
population.

We have compared a number of galaxy parameters (dust-to-
stars, gas-to-stars, sSFR, and morphology) for Coma cluster and
ﬁlament galaxies and considered how each is affected by local
galaxy number density (Σ1, Σ5, Σ10, and projected cluster radius).
Using the galaxy zoo weightings of probability of being a spiral
(p(S)) or elliptical (p(E)) we deﬁned a new parameter (Φ), where
Φ = p(S) − p(E). We show that Φ is strongly affected by local
number density (environment), which is another way of represent-
ing the morphology-density relation (Dressler 1980). We ﬁnd that
the above measured parameters of early-type galaxies appear to be
only very weakly or not at all affected by their environment. Late
types also show a weak change in most of the above parameters
with environment - the exception being gas-to-stars ratio, which is
strongly affected by environmental density on all scales.

In order to understand how the baryonic components of the
galaxies change as a whole between the cluster and ﬁlament we
have created baryonic mass functions. Using Schechter ﬁts to stel-
lar, gas and dust mass functions for the Coma cluster and ﬁlament
we compare their parameters (φ, M∗ and α) with values found for
the Virgo cluster and a ﬁeld sample. Other than φ, which is depen-
dant on a somewhat arbitrary calculation of volume, we found M∗
and α to be identical between environments. We calculate the ratio
of gas-to-stellar and dust-to-stellar mass densities for each environ-
ment ﬁnding that within the errors Virgo, Fornax, Coma and the
ﬁlament are all gas deﬁcient when compared to the general ﬁeld,
but that this is not so for the dust. Galaxies in dense environment
are far more prone to gas rather than dust loss.
