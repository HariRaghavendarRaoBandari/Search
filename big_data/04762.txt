Introduction

In the past decade revolutionary progress has been made in hadron spectroscopy. Many
baryons with single heavy quark have been observed experimentally [1]. At the same time
many new charmonium and bottomonium like states have also been discovered [2]. These
states have more complicated structure compared to the ones predicted by the quark model.
These experimental achievements have carried the studies to a new level, namely, the
In this work we concentrate our attention on the

study of the decays of these baryons.
heavy baryons with single heavy quark, and investigate their electromagnetic decays.

According to SU(3) classiﬁcation, the heavy baryons ground states with spin–1/2 belong
to the sextet representation; and with spin–3/2 to the sextet and spin–1/2 to the anti–triplet
representations. It is customary to denote these representations as 6, 6∗ and ¯3.

The radiative decays among the baryons belonging to these representations have already
been studied in framework of the nonrelativistic potential model [3], light cone QCD sum
rules incorporating with the heavy quark eﬀective theory [4], and incorporating both with
heavy and chiral symmetry [5]; (2 + 1) ﬂavor lattice QCD [6]; heavy hadron chiral perturba-
tion theory [7, 8]; chiral perturbation theory [9]; relativistic three–quark model [10], heavy
quark symmetry [11], static quark model [12], bag model [13], which lead to quite diﬀerent
results. Therefore further independent calculations on these decay widths are necessary.

The present work is devoted to the study of the ΣQ → ΛQγ and Ξ′

Q → ΞQγ decays
in framework of the light cone QCD sum rules. Note that, the decay widths between the
6∗ → 6 and 6∗ → ¯3 transitions have been studied earlier in framework of the light cone
QCD sum rules method in [14, 15].
In section 2, light cone QCD sum rules for the
electromagnetic form factor F2(q2 = 0) responsible for these decays is derived. The last
section is devoted to the numerical analysis. In this section we also present a comparison
of our predictions with the results of other approaches.

The paper is organized as follows.

2 Light cone QCD sum rules for the ΣQ → ΛQγ and

Ξ′Q → ΞQγ decay form factors

In this section we derive the light cone QCD sum rules for the radiative ΣQ → ΛQγ and
Ξ′
Q → ΞQγ decay form factors. For this purpose we start with the deﬁnition of the transition
matrix element between heavy baryon states in presence of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, i.e.,

µ(cid:12)(cid:12) BQ1(p + q, s)(cid:11). This matrix element is parametrized in terms of the Dirac
(cid:10)BQ2(p, s′)(cid:12)(cid:12)jel

µ(cid:12)(cid:12) BQ1(p + q, s)(cid:11) = ¯u(p)(cid:20)(cid:18)γµ − 6 qqµ

F1(Q2) and Pauli F2(Q2) form factors in the following way:

For the real photons, obviously, we need to know the values of these form factors only at the
point Q2 = −q2 = 0. This process, i.e., transition of one of the heavy baryon in the sextet

representation, to another heavy baryon in the anti–triplet representation in presence of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld, is described by the following correlation function,

and eQ for the light and heavy quarks; and ηs

the sextet and anti–triplet representations, respectively.

Introducing a plane wave electromagnetic background ﬁeld Fµν = i(εµqν − ενqµ)eiqx, it

is possible to rewrite the correlator (2) in the following way,

Πµ(p, q)εµ = iZ d4xeipx h0 |T {ηQ1(0) ¯ηQ2(x)}| 0iF ,

(4)

where the subscript F means that all vacuum expectation values should be evaluated in
the background ﬁeld Fµν. The correlation function given in Eq. (2) can be obtained from
Eq. (3) by expanding it in powers of the background ﬁeld, and considering only the linear
term in Fµν which corresponds to the single photon emission. More about the details of
the application of the background ﬁeld method can be found in [17] and [18].

In order to obtain the sum rules for the electromagnetic form factors describing the
ΣQ → ΛQγ and Ξ′
Q → ΞQγ transition the correlation function is calculated in terms of
hadrons from one side, and in terms of the quark–gluon degrees of freedom by using the
operator product expansion (OPE) and introducing the photon distribution amplitudes
(DAs) from the other side. The photon DAs are the main nonperturbative ingredient of the
light cone sum rules. In this version of the light cone QCD sum rules OPE is performed by

2

twist of the nonlocal operator, rather than dimensions of the operators in the traditional
sum rules. The sum rules is obtained by matching these two representations.

We start our analysis by constructing the correlation function from the hadronic side. It
can be obtained by inserting all intermediate hadronic sum rules, having the same quantum
numbers as the corresponding interpolating currents ηQ. After isolating the ground state’s
contribution ve get,

where the contributions coming from the higher states and continuum is denoted by dots,
and p1 = p2 + q.

The expression for the correlator function can be obtained from the hadronic side sub-
stituting the matrix elements appearing in Eq. (2). These matrix elements are deﬁned in
the standard way as follows,

h0|ηBQ2|BQ2(p2)i = λ2uBQ2 (p2) ,
hBQ1(p1)|ηBQ1|0i = λ1 ¯uBQ1 (p1) ,

where λi are the residues of the hadrons, BQi are the baryons and mBQi

motion, the matrix element hBQ2(p2)|jel
µ (q)|BQ1(p1)i can be written in the following way,

Inserting Eqs. (6) and (7) into Eq. (5), and performing summation over spins of the Dirac

where we set p2 = p,p1 = p + q and qε = 0. It can easily be seen from Eq. (8) that the
correlation function possesses many structures any of them can be used for constructing
the sum rules for the form factors F1 + F2 and F2. The experience in working with the sum
rules shows that the structures containing maximum number of momenta exhibit rather
good convergence. For this reason in calculation of the form factors F1 + F2 and F2, we
shall chose the structures /p/ε/q and /p(pε), respectively. In this work we calculate only the
form factor F2 since the transitions under consideration is described only by the form factor

3

F2. Note that the form factor F1 + F2 has already been calculated for the transitions under
consideration in [19] and [20]. The expression of the correlator function given in Eq. (3)
can be obtained in the deep Euclidean region in terms of photon DAs with increasing twist,
where p ≪ 0, and (p + q)2 ≪ 0.
Calculation of the correlation function can be carried out straightforwardly using the
Wick’s theorem. In performing this calculation the expressions of the light and heavy quark
propagators in presence of the external ﬁeld are needed. The light quark propagator in the
background ﬁeld is calculated in [21], and it is found that the contributions of the nonlocal
operators ¯qGq, ¯qG2q, ¯qq ¯qq are quite small. Neglecting these contributions the expression
of the light quark propagator can be written as,

Having the expressions of the light and heavy quark propagators at hand, calculation
of the theoretical part of the correlation function is a straightforward, but rather a tedious
calculation. Here at this point, one technical remark is in order. To be able to express the
vacuum expectation value h0|q(x)¯q(0)|0iF in terms of the photon DAs, the Fierz identity
needs to be used. It should be noted here that, our approach in calculating the nonpertur-
bative contribution to the correlation function follows the line of [23] for the D∗Dπ coupling
with the replacement of the pion DAs by the photon DAs.

As has already been noted, in constructing the sum rules for the form factor F2(0) we
have decided to choose the structure (ε·p) 6 p6 q, in both representations of the correlation
function.
In obtaining the ﬁnal result for the sum rule of the form factor F2(0), Borel
transformation over the variables p2 and (p + q)2 is implemented using the quark–hadron
duality anzats. Following these steps of calculation, we ﬁnally get the following sum rule
for the form factor F2(0),

where λBQ1 and λBQ2 are the residues of the corresponding sextet and anti–triplet baryons,
respectively, whose expressions can be found in [19] and [20]; M 2
2 are the Borel mass
parameters for the corresponding channels. It should be noted here that, for consistency, the
perturbative O(αs) corrections are neglected in the calculations of residues, since they are
not included in sum rules (11). These corrections might give considerable contribution to
the form factor F2(0) similar to the D∗Dπ case. But, calculation of the radiative corrections
lies beyond the scope of the present work. Explicit expression of ΠB(theor) can be found in
Appendix A. The second term on the left hand side of Eq. (11) describes the contributions of
the higher states and continuum. In calculating the contributions of these states we shall use
the quark–hadron duality ansatz, i.e., above some predetermined thresholds in the (s1, s2)
plane the hadronic spectral density is replaced by the QCD spectral density ρQCD(s1, s2).
Using this ansatz, the continuum subtraction can be carried out by the procedure explained
in [23]. Leaving aside the technical details, in the case M 2
1 = M 2
2 = 2M 2, and u0 = 1/2,
the subtraction procedure can be performed by using the formula,

We see from the expression of ΠB(theor) that the leading twist term ϕγ(u0) is proportional
bM 2. Therefore, higher
bM 4, and higher twist terms are proportional to m4
to m4
twist terms that are suppressed by inverse powers of M 2 with respect to the leading ones
remain unaﬀected. Therefore, continuum subtraction procedure is not performed for the
higher twist terms (for more detail see [23]). It should be noted here that, in principle,
single dispersion integrals originate in the subtractions which make the double dispersion
integral ﬁnite, can enter to the spectral density. But these terms are all killed by the double
Borel transformations.

bM 2 or m2

The masses of the initial and ﬁnal heavy baryons are quite close to each other, hence
2 = 2M 2, which naturally leads to u0 = 1/2. In our numerical analysis

we can set M 2
we use these values of M 2 and u0.

3 Numerical results

In this section we perform the numerical analysis using the sum rules for the form fac-
tor F2(0). The values input parameters used in this calculation are as follows: The

5

quark condensate h¯uui(µ = 1 GeV ) = −(0.243)3 GeV 3, h¯ssi|µ=1 GeV = 0.8h¯uui|µ=1 GeV ,
m2
0 = (0.8 ± 0.2) GeV 2 which is obtained from the analysis of two–point sum rules for the
light baryons [24, 25], and B, B∗ [26], respectively, f3γ = −0.0039 GeV 2 [18], magnetic
susceptibility χ which is calculated in [27–29], where we use χ(µ = 1 GeV ) = −2.85 GeV −2
in the present work.
The sum rules for the form factor F2(0) contain also three auxiliary parameters, namely,
the Borel mass parameter M 2, the arbitrary parameter, and the continuum threshold s0.
Obviously, any physical quantity must be independent of the above–mentioned auxiliary
parameters. Therefore, we should ﬁnd the regions of these parameters for which the form
factor F2(0) shows no sensitivity to their variation. The continuum threshold is related to
the mass of the ﬁrst excited state. The energy needed to excite particle from the ground

state to the ﬁrst excited state is equal to (√s0 − m) where m is the mass of the baryon
in its ground state. Usually, (√s0 − m) varies in the interval 0.3 GeV and 0.8 GeV .

The experimental values of the heavy baryons are reproduced quite well if the continuum
threshold varies in the following regions,

√s0 =

(3.1 ± 0.1) GeV, for Σc → Λc ,
(3.2 ± 0.1) GeV, for Ξ′
c → Ξc ,
(6.6 ± 0.2) GeV, for Σb → Λb ,
(6.7 ± 0.2) GeV, for Ξ′
b → Ξb .

(13)

The upper and lower bounds of the Borel mass parameter M 2 are determined by im-

posing the following two conditions:
a) The contributions of the higher states and continuum should be less than the contribu-
tions of the ground state.
b) Contributions of the higher twist terms should be less than the contributions of the
leading twist terms.
As the result of these two conditions, the “working regions” of the Borel parameter for the
transitions under consideration is determined to be,

2.0 GeV 2 ≤ M 2 ≤ 3.0 GeV 2, for Σc → Λcγ ,
2.2 GeV 2 ≤ M 2 ≤ 3.4 GeV 2, for Ξ′
c → Ξcγ ,
5.0 GeV 2 ≤ M 2 ≤ 7.0 GeV 2, for Σb → Λbγ ,
5.0 GeV 2 ≤ M 2 ≤ 7.5 GeV 2, for Ξ′
b → Ξbγ .

(14)

In order to ﬁnd the working region of the arbitrary parameter β for the transitions
under consideration, we have studied the dependence of F2(0) on cos θ, where β = tan θ,
at several ﬁxed values of the continuum threshold s0, and Borel parameters M 2 chose from
the working regions given in Eqs. (13) and (14), respectively. Our numerical analysis shows
that, in the domain −0.7 ≤ cos θ ≤ −0.4, which is common for all the considered radiative
decays, the form factor F2(0) is practically independent of the arbitrary parameter β, and

6

we ﬁnally obtain the following values for the form factor F2(0),

F2(0) =

Few words about the uncertainty in determination of the form factor F2(0) are in order.
The radiative O(αs) corrections can of course bring their own uncertainty in calculation of
the form factor F2(0), which are not taken into account in the present work. We estimate
the uncertainties coming only from the errors in values of the input parameters entering to
the sum rules.

Having calculated the values of the form factor F2(0), we can easily calculate the values
of the considered decays widths by using Eq. (14), whose results are summarized in Table
2.
In this table, for completeness we also present the predictions on the decay widths
calculated in other approaches, such as nonrelativistic quark model [3], QCD sum rules
method [4], heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory ([5], [7] and [8]), relativistic quark
model [10], heavy quark symmetry that is implemented with the light quark symmetry
[11], naive static quark model [12], and bag model [13].

Q → ΞQγ transitions (in units of KeV)

Table 2: Decay widths of the ΣQ → ΛQγ and Ξ′
From the comparison of our results with those existing in literature, we see that our
predictions are closer to the predictions of the relativistic quark model, and especially our
result for the Ξ′−
b γ transition coincides with the result of [7]. We also observe
that there appears considerable diﬀerence among our results and the predictions of the
other approaches on the decay widths of the considered transitions. Of course, only the
experimental measurements of these decays can play the “judge” for choosing the right
“theory”.

b → Ξ−

In conclusion, we calculate the form factor F2(0) for the ΣQ → ΛQγ and Ξ′

Q → ΞQγ
transitions within the light cone QCD sum rules method. The corresponding decay widths

7

are estimated by using these values of the form factor F2(0). Comparison of our predictions
on decay widths with the results of other approaches is presented.
