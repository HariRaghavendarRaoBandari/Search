Convergence of the Newton’s Method for generalized equations

under the majorant condition

Gilson N. Silva ∗

March 08, 2016

Abstract

In this paper we consider Newton’s method for solving the generalized equation in Hilbert
spaces of the type F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0, where F is a Fr´echet diﬀerentiable function and T is a set-
valued and maximal monotone. We show that this method is local quadratically convergent to a
solution. The analysis presented based on Banach Perturbation Lemma for generalized equation
and the majorant condition relaxing Lipschitz continuity of the derivative F ′, allow to obtain
the optimal convergence radius, uniqueness of solution and also unify some result pertaining the
Newton’s method theory.

Keywords: Generalized Equation, Newton’s Method, Hilbert Spaces, Majorant Condition, Maxi-
mal Monotone Operator.

1 Introduction

In this paper we are interested in the solution of the generalized equation

F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0,

(1)

where F : Ω → H is a Fr´echet diﬀerentiable function, H is a Hibert space, Ω ⊆ H an open set
and T : H ⇒ H is set-valued and maximal monotone. As is well known, the generalized equation
(1) covers wide range of problems in classical analysis and its applications. For instance, systems
of nonlinear equations and abstract inequality systems. If ψ : H → (−∞, +∞] is a proper lower
semicontinuous convex function and

T (x) = ∂ψ(x) = {u ∈ H : ψ(y) ≥ ψ(x) + hu, y − xi},

∀y ∈ H,

then (1) becomes the variational inequality problem

F (x) + ∂ψ(x) ∋ 0,

including linear and nonlinear complementary problems; additional comments about such problems
can be found in [5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 16, 20, 22].

Newton’s method is one of the most important methods to solve (1) which generates a sequence,

for an initial point x0, as follows

f (xk) + f ′(xk)(xk+1 − xk) + F (xk+1) ∋ 0,

k = 0, 1, . . . .

(2)

This method may be viewed as a Newton-type method based on a partial linearization, which has
been studied in several papers including [4, 5, 6, 14]; see also [7, Section 6C] where a interesting
discussion about iterative methods for solving generalized equations is presented. When F ≡ 0, the
iteration (2) becomes the standard Newton’s method for solving the nonlinear equation F (x) = 0.
In [2, 21] under a majorant condition and generalized Lipschitz condition, local and semi local
convergence, quadratic rate and estimate of the best possible convergence radius of Newtons method
as well as uniqueness of the solution for solving generalized equation were established.

One usual assumption used to obtain quadratic convergence of Newton’s method (2), for solving
equation (1), is the Lipschitz continuity of F ′ in a neighborhood the solution; see [7].
Indeed,
keeping control of the derivative is an important point in the convergence analysis of Newton’s
method. On the other hand, a couple of papers have dealt with the issue of convergence analysis of
the Newton’s method, for solving the equation F (x) = 0, by relaxing the assumption of Lipschitz
continuity of F ′, see for example [12, 23, 24], actually all this conditions are equivalent to X. Wang’s
condition introduced in [23]. The advantage of working with a majorant condition rests in the fact
that it allow to unify several convergence results pertaining to Newton’s method; see [12, 23].

In this paper we rephrase the majorant condition introduced in [12], in order to study the local
convergence properties of Newton’s method (2). The analysis presented provides a clear relationship
between the majorant function and the function deﬁning the generalized equation. Also, it allows
us to obtain the optimal convergence radius for the method with respect to the majorant condition
and uniqueness of solution. The analysis of this method, under Lipschitz’s condition and Smale’s
condition, are provided as special case.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, some notations and important results
used throughout the paper are presented. In Section 3, the main result is stated and in Section 3.1
properties of the majorant function, the main relationships between the majorant function and
the nonlinear operator, the uniqueness of the solution and the optimal convergence radius are
established. In Section 3.2 the main result is proved and some applications of this result are given
in Section 4. Some ﬁnal remarks are made in Section 5.

2 Preliminaries

The following notations and results are used throughout our presentation. Let H be a Hilbert space
with scalar product h., .i and norm k.k, the open and closed balls at x with radius δ ≥ 0 are denoted,
respectively, by B(x, δ) := {y ∈ X : kx − yk < δ} and B[x, δ] := {y ∈ X : kx − yk 6 δ}.
We denote by L (X, Y ) the space consisting of all continuous linear mappings A : X → Y and
the operator norm of A is deﬁned by kAk := sup {kAxk : kxk 6 1}. Recall that a bounded linear
operator G : H → H is called a positive operator if G is a self-conjugate and hGx, xi ≤ 0 for each
x ∈ H. The domain and the range of H are, respectively, the sets dom H := {x ∈ X : H(x) 6= ∅}
and rge H := {y ∈ Y : y ∈ H(x) for some x ∈ X}. The inverse of H is the set-valued mapping
H −1 : Y ⇒ X deﬁned by H −1(y) := {x ∈ X : y ∈ H(x)}.

Now, we recall notions of monotonicity for set-valued operators.

Deﬁnition 1. Let T : H ⇒ H be a set-valued operator. T is said to be monotone if for any
x, y ∈ dom T and, u ∈ T (y), v ∈ T (x) implies that the follwing inequality holds:

hu − v, y − xi ≥ 0.

2

A subset of H × H is monotone if it is the graph of a monotone operator. If ϕ : H → (−∞, +∞]

is a proper function then the subgradient of ϕ is monotone.

Deﬁnition 2. Let T : H ⇒ H be monotone. Then T is maximal monotone if the following
implication holds for all x, u ∈ H:

hu − v, y − xi ≥ 0
An example of maximal monotone operator is the subgradiente of a proper, lower semicontinu-

v ∈ T (y) ⇒ x ∈ domT and v ∈ T (x).

(3)

for each

y ∈ domT and

ous, convex function ϕ : H → (−∞, +∞]. The following result can de found in [22].
Lemma 1. Let G be a positive operator. The following statements about G hold:

1. kG2k = kGk2;
2. If G−1 exists, then G−1 is a positive operator.

As a consequence of this result we have the following result:

Lemma 2. Let G be a positive operator. Suppose that G−1 exists, then for each x ∈ H we have

Proof. See Lemma 2.2 of [20].

hGx, xi ≥ kxk2
kG−1k

.

Let G : H → H be a bounded linear opeartor. We will use the convention that bG := 1
where G∗ is the conjugate operator of G. As we can see, bG is a self-conjugate operator. From

now, we assume that T : H ⇒ H is a set-valued maximal monotone operator and F : H → H is a
Fr´echet derivative function. The next result is of major importance to prove the good deﬁnition of
Newton’s method. Its proof can be found in [18, Lemma 1, p.189].

2 (G + G∗)

Lemma 3 (Banach’s lemma). Let B : H → H be a bounded linear operator and I : H → H the
identity operator. If kB − Ik < 1 then B is invertible and kB−1k ≤ 1/(1 − kB − Ik).

3 Local analysis of Newton’s method

In this section, we study the Newton’s method for solving the generalized equation (1), which is
based in the partial linearization of this equation, see [13] (see also, [5]). For study the convergence
properties of this method, we assume that the derivative F ′ satisﬁes a weak Lipschitz condition on
a region Ω relaxing the usual Lipschitz condition. The statement of the our main result is:

Theorem 4. Let H be a Hilbert space, Ω be an open nonempty subset of H, F : Ω → H be
continuous with Fr´echet derivative F ′ continuous, T : H ⇒ H be a set-valued operator and x∗ ∈ Ω.
Suppose that 0 ∈ F (x∗) + T (x∗), F ′(x∗) is a positive operator and \F ′(x∗)
exists. Let R > 0 and
κ := sup{t ∈ [0, R) : B(x∗, t) ⊂ Ω}. Suppose that there exist f : [0, R) → R twice continuously
diﬀerentiable such that

k(cid:13)(cid:13)F ′(x) − F ′(x∗ + τ (x − x∗))(cid:13)(cid:13) ≤ f ′ (kx − x∗k) − f ′ (τkx − x∗k) ,

for all τ ∈ [0, 1], x ∈ B(x∗, κ) and

h1) f (0) = 0 and f ′(0) = −1;
h2) f ′ is convex and strictly increasing.

Let ν := sup{t ∈ [0, R) : f ′(t) < 0}, ρ := sup{t ∈ (0, ν) : f (t)/(tf ′(t)) − 1 < 1} and r := min{κ, ρ} .
Then, the sequences with starting point x0 ∈ B(x∗, r)/{x∗} and t0 = kx∗ − x0k, respectively,
k = 0, 1, . . . ,

0 ∈ F (xk) + F ′(xk)(xk+1 − xk) + T (xk+1),

tk+1 = |tk − f (tk)/f ′(tk)|,

(5)

are well deﬁned, {tk} is strictly decreasing, is contained in (0, r) and converges to 0, {xk} is con-
tained in B(x∗, r) and converges to the point x∗ which is the unique solution of the generalized
equation F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 in B(x∗, ¯σ), where ¯σ = min{r, σ} and σ := sup{0 < t < κ : f (t) < 0}.
Moreover, the sequence {tk+1/t2
kx∗ − xk+1k ≤(cid:2)tk+1/t2

k} is strictly decreasing,
tk+1/t2

k(cid:3)kxk − x∗k2,

k ≤ f ′′(t0)/(2|f ′(t0)|),

k = 0, 1, . . . .

If, additionally, f (ρ)/(ρf ′(ρ)) − 1 = 1 and ρ < κ, then r = ρ is the optimal convergence radius.
Remark 1. Combining both inequalities in (6), we conclude that {xk} converges Q-quadratically
to ¯x. Moreover, as {tk+1/t2
0, for k = 0, 1, . . . . Thus,
ﬁrst inequality in (6) implies k¯x − xk+1k ≤(cid:2)t1/t2
k¯x − xkk ≤ t0 (t1/t0)2k

0(cid:3)kxk − ¯xk2, for k = 0, 1, . . . . As a consequence,

k} is strictly decreasing we have tk+1/t2

k = 0, 1, . . . .

k < t1/t2

−1 ,

(6)

Remark 2. Since T is monotone maximal, if there exists a constant c > 0 such that

hF ′(xk)y, yi ≥ ckyk2

(7)

for each y ∈ H, then there exist an unique point xk+1 such that the ﬁrst inclusion in (5) holds. The
proof of this result can be found in [20, Lemma 2.2]. Hence, if for each k, there exist a constant
c > 0 such that (7) holds, then the sequence generated by (5) is well deﬁned.

From now on, we assume that the hypotheses of Theorem 4 hold.

3.1 Basics results

In this section, we establish some relationships between the majorant function f and the set-valued
mapping F + T . We begin by reminding that Proposition 2.5 of [9] state that the constants κ, ν
and σ are positive and t − f (t)/f ′(t) < 0, for all t ∈ (0, ν). According to h2 and deﬁnition of ν, we
have f ′(t) < 0 for all t ∈ [0, ν). Therefore, the Newton iteration map for f is well deﬁned in [0, ν),
namely, nf : [0, ν) → (−∞, 0] is deﬁned by

nf (t) := t − f (t)/f ′(t),

t ∈ [0, ν).

(8)

The next proposition was proved in Proposition 2.6 and Proposition 2.7 of [9].
Proposition 5. The mapping (0, ν) ∋ t 7→ |nf (t)|/t2 is strictly increasing and

|nf (t)|/t2 ≤ f ′′(t)/(2|f ′(t)|),

for all t ∈ (0, ν). Moreover, the constant ρ is positive. As a consequence, |nf (t)| < t for all t ∈ (0, ρ).

4

Using (8), it easy to see that the sequence {tk} is equivalently deﬁned as
k = 0, 1, . . . .

t0 = kx∗ − x0k,

tk+1 = |nf (tk)|,

(9)

Next result, which is a consequence of above proposition, contain the main convergence properties
of the above sequence and its prove can be found in Corollary 2.8 of [9].

Corollary 6. The sequence {tk} is well deﬁned, is strictly decreasing and is contained in (0, ρ).
Moreover, {tk+1/t2
k ≤ [f ′′(t0)/(2|f ′(t0)|)],
for k = 0, 1, . . . .

k} is strictly decreasing, {tk} converges to 0 and tk+1/t2

In the sequel we will prove that the partial linearization of F + T has a single-valued inverse,
which is Lipschitz in a neighborhood of x∗. Since Newton’s iteration at a point in this neighborhood
happens to be a zero of the partial linearization of F + T at such a point, it will be ﬁrst convenient
to study the linearization error of F at a point in Ω

In the next result we bound this error by the linearization error of the majorant function f , namely,

EF (x, y) := F (y) −(cid:2)F (x) + F ′(x)(y − x)(cid:3) ,
ef (t, u) := f (u) −(cid:2)f (t) + f ′(t)(u − t)(cid:3) ,

−1

t, u ∈ [0, R).

y, x ∈ Ω.

(10)

Lemma 7. There holds k \F ′(x∗)
Proof. Since x∗ + (1 − u)(x − x∗) ∈ B(x∗, κ), for all 0 ≤ u ≤ 1 and F is continuously diﬀerentiable
in Ω, thus the deﬁnition of EF and some simple manipulations yield

kkEF (x, x∗)k ≤ ef (kx∗ − xk, 0), for all x ∈ B(x∗, κ).

k(cid:13)(cid:13)F ′(x) − F ′(x∗ + (1 − u)(x − x∗))](cid:13)(cid:13) kx∗ − xk du.

Combining last inequality with (4) with τ = 1 − u and then performing the integral obtained using
that f (0) = 0 we obtain that

[f ′(kx∗ − xk) − f ′((1 − u)kx∗ − xk)]kx∗ − xk du

= f ′(kx∗ − xk)kx∗ − xk − f (kx∗ − xk).

Therefore using h1 and the deﬁnition of ef the statement follows.

In the next result we will present the main relationships between the majorant function f and

the operator F . The result is a consequence of Banach’s lemma and its statement is:

Lemma 8. Let x∗ ∈ H be such that \F ′(x∗) is a positive operator and \F ′(x∗)
min{κ, ν}, then \F ′(x) is a positive operator and \F ′(x)

exists. Moreover,

1
2k(F ′(x) − F ′(x∗))∗k = kF ′(x) − F ′(x∗)k.

(11)

Take x ∈ B(x∗, r). Since r < ν we have kx − x∗k < ν. Thus, f ′(kx − x∗) < 0 which, together (4)
and h1, taking into account (11), imply that for all x ∈ B(x∗, r)

−1

k \F ′(x∗)

kk\F ′(x) − \F ′(x∗)k ≤ k \F ′(x∗)

Thus, by Banach’s lemma, we conclude that \F ′(x)

kkF ′(x) − F ′(x∗)k ≤ f ′(kx − x∗k) − f ′(0) < 1.
exists. Moreover by above inequality,

The last result follows by noting that r = min{κ, ν}. On the other hand, using (12) we have

k\F ′(x) − \F ′(x∗)k ≤

(13)

Take y ∈ H. Then, it follows by above inequality that

h( \F ′(x∗) − \F ′(x))y, yi ≤ k \F ′(x∗) − \F ′(x)kkyk2 ≤

which implies, after of simple manipulations that

Since \F ′(x∗) is a positive operator and \F ′(x∗)

exists by assumption, we obtain by Lemma 2 that

h \F ′(x∗)y, yi ≥

kyk2
k \F ′(x∗)

−1

.

k

Therefore, combining the two last inequalities we conclude that h\F ′(x)y, yi ≥ 0, i.e, \F ′(x) is a

positive operator.

Lemma 8 shows that \F ′(x) is a positive operator and \F ′(x)

−1

exists, thus by Lemma 2 we have

that for any y ∈ H

h\F ′(x)y, yi ≥

kyk2
k\F ′(x)

−1

.

k

Note that h\F ′(x)y, yi = hF ′(x)y, yi, thus by the second part of Lemma 8 and h2 we conclude that
F ′(x) satisﬁes (7) and consequently, the Newton iteration mapping is well-deﬁned. Let us call
NF +T , the Newton iteration mapping for f + F in that region, namely, NF +T : B(x∗, r) → H is
deﬁned by
(14)
Therefore, one can apply a single Newton iteration on any x ∈ B(x∗, r) to obtain NF +T (x) which
may not belong to B(x∗, r), or even may not belong to the domain of F . Thus, this is enough to
guarantee the well-deﬁnedness of only one iteration of Newton’s method. To ensure that Newtonian
iterations may be repeated indeﬁnitely, we need an additional result.

0 ∈ F (x) + F ′(x)(NF +T (x) − x) + T (NF +T (x)),

∀ x ∈ B(x∗, r).

Lemma 9. Take 0 < t < r. If kx − x∗k ≤ t then kNF +T (x) − x∗k ≤ [|nf (t)|/t2]kx − x∗k2. As a
consequence, NF +T (B[x∗, t]) ⊂ B[x∗,|nf (t)|]. Moreover, NF +T (B(x∗, r)) ⊂ B(x∗, r).
Proof. Since 0 ∈ F (x∗) + T (x∗) we have x∗ = NF +T (x∗). Thus, the inequality of the lemma is
trivial for x = x∗. Now, assume that 0 < kx − x∗k ≤ t. Let y = NF +T (x). By (14) we have
0 ∈ F (x) + F ′(x)(y − x) + T (y) for all x ∈ B(x∗, r). As T is a maximal monotone, it follows that

hF (x) − F (x∗) + F ′(x)(x∗ − x) + F ′(x)(y − x∗), x∗ − yi ≥ 0

which implies that

hF (x) − F (x∗) + F ′(x)(x∗ − x), x∗ − yi ≥ hF ′(x)(x∗ − y), x∗ − yi.

(15)

Since, by Lemma 8, \F ′(x) is a positive operator and \F ′(x)

−1

exists, we obtain from Lemma 2 that

kx∗ − yk2
k\F ′(x)
k

−1

≤ h\F ′(x)(x∗ − y), x∗ − yi.

(16)

Note that h\F ′(x)(x∗ − y), x∗ − yi = hF ′(x)(x∗ − y), x∗ − yi, this together (16) and (15) yields that
kx∗ − yk2 ≤ k\F ′(x)
khF (x) − F (x∗) + F ′(x)(x∗ − x), x∗ − yi.

khF ′(x)(x∗ − y), x∗ − yi ≤ k\F ′(x)

−1

−1

Hence, after simple manipulations, above inequality becomes

kx∗ − yk ≤ k\F ′(x)

−1

kkF (x) − F (x∗) + F ′(x)(x∗ − x)k.

Using (10), second part in Lemma 8 and Lemma 7 in (17) we obtain that

kx∗ − yk ≤ k \F ′(x∗)

−1

k

|f ′(kx − x∗k)|kEF (x, x∗)k ≤

ef (kx − x∗k, 0)
|f ′(kx − x∗k)|

.

(17)

(18)

On the other hand, taking into account that f (0) = 0, the deﬁnitions of ef and nf imply that

ef (kx − x∗k, 0)
|f ′(kx − x∗k)|

= −nf (kx − x∗k) = |nf (kx − x∗k)|.

As kx − x∗k ≤ t, the ﬁrst part of Proposition 5 gives |nf (kx − x∗k)|/kx − x∗k2 ≤ |nf (t)|/t2, thus
the last inequality becomes

ef (kx − x∗k, 0)
|f ′(kx − x∗k)| ≤ |nf (t)|/t2kx − x∗k2.

Hence, the desired inequality follows by combining (18) and the latter equation.

For proving second part of the lemma, take x ∈ B[x∗, t]. Since kx − x∗k ≤ t, ﬁrst part of the
lemma implies that kNF +T (x) − x∗k ≤ |nf (t)|, and the ﬁrst inclusion follows. Due to r ≤ ρ, second
part of Proposition 5 implies that |nf (t)| ≤ t. Thus, the last inclusion is an immediate consequence
of the ﬁrst one.

In the next result we obtain the uniqueness of the solution in the neighborhood B[¯x, σ].

7

Lemma 10. Take t ∈ (0, r) and suppose that F ′(x∗) is a positive operator and \F ′(x∗)
exists. If
f (t) < 0, i.e, 0 is the unique zero of f in [0, t], then x∗ is the unique solution of (1) in B[x∗, t]. As
consequence, x∗ is the unique solution of (1) in B[x∗, ¯σ].

−1

Proof. Assume that y ∈ B[x∗, t] and 0 ∈ F (y) + T (y). Then, as T is a maximal monotone and
0 ∈ F (x∗) + T (x∗) we obtain that

hF (y) − F (x∗), x∗ − yi ≥ 0,

which implies that hF (y) − F (x∗) − F ′(x∗)(y − x∗) + F ′(x∗)(y − x∗), x∗ − yi ≥ 0 and thus

hF (y) − F (x∗) − F ′(x∗)(y − x∗), x∗ − yi ≥ hF ′(x∗)(x∗ − y), (x∗ − y)i.

Since F ′(x∗) is a positive operator and \F ′(x∗)

−1

exists, we can apply Lemma 2 to obtain that

hF ′(x∗)(x∗ − y), (x∗ − y)i = h \F ′(x∗)(x∗ − y), (x∗ − y)i ≥ kx∗ − yk2

On the other hand

(19)

(20)

Combining above equality with (20) and (19), yields that

F (y) − F (x∗) − F ′(x∗)(y − x∗) =Z 1
ky − x∗k ≤Z 1

[F ′(x∗ + t(y − x∗)) − F ′(x∗)](y − x∗)dt.

0

Using (4) with x = x∗ + t(y − x∗) and τ = 0 it is easy to conclude from the last equality that

ky − x∗k ≤Z 1

0

[f ′(tky − x∗k) − f ′(0)]ky − x∗kdt = f (ky − x∗k) − f (0) − f ′(0)ky − x∗k.

Taking into account that f (0) = 0 and f ′(0) = −1 the latter inequality becomes

f (ky − x∗k) ≥ 0.

Since f is strictly convex and f (t) < 0, we will have f < 0 in (0, t], i.e, 0 is the unique zero of f in
[0, t] and hence, the above inequality implies that ky − x∗k = 0, i.e, y = x∗. Thus, x∗ is the unique
zero of F + T ∋ 0 in B[x∗, t]. The second part follows from the deﬁnition of σ.

In the next result we will obtain the the optimal convergence radius, which has its proof similar

to the proof of Lemma 2.15 of [9].

Lemma 11. If f (ρ)/(ρf ′(ρ)) − 1 = 1 and ρ < κ, then r = ρ is the optimal convergence radius.

3.2 Proof of Theorem 4

First, note that the inclusion in (5) together (14) imply that the sequence {xk} satisﬁes

0 ∈ F (xk) + F ′(xk)(NF +T (xk) − xk) + T (NF +T (xk)),

k = 0, 1, . . . ,

(21)

which is indeed an equivalent deﬁnition of this sequence.

8

Proof. All statements involving {tk} were proved in Corollary 6. As x0 ∈ B(x∗, r), and r ≤ ν, we
conclude by combining (21) and inclusion Nf +F (B(x∗, r)) ⊂ B(x∗, r) in second part of Lemma 9
that {xk} is well deﬁned and remains in B(x∗, r). Now, we are going to prove that {xk} converges
towards x∗. Without lose generality we assume that the sequence {xk} is inﬁnity. Since 0 <
kxk − x∗k < r ≤ ρ, for k = 0, 1, . . . , we obtain from (21), Lemma 9 and second part of Proposition 5
that
(22)
Thus, {kxk − x∗k} is strictly decreasing and convergent. Let ¯α = limk→∞ kxk − x∗k. Because
{kxk − x∗k} rest in (0, ρ) and it is strictly decreasing we have 0 ≤ ¯α < ρ. Then, by continuity of nf
and (22) imply 0 ≤ ¯α = |nf (¯α)|, and from second part of Proposition 5 we have ¯α = 0. Therefore,
the convergence of {xk} to x∗ is proved. Now, we are going to show the ﬁrst inequality in (6). Due
to t0 = kx∗ − x0k, deﬁnition of {tk} in (9) implies that tk+1 = |nf (tk)|, hence (21) and Lemma 9
imply that

kxk+1 − x∗k ≤ |nf (kxk − x∗k)| < kxk − x∗k,

k = 0, 1, . . . .

kxk+1 − x∗k = kNF +T (xk) − x∗k ≤ |nf (tk)|,

k = 0, 1, . . . .

Therefore, the desired inequality follows from last inequality, ﬁrst part of Lemma 9 and the deﬁnition
of {tk} in (9). Finally, the uniqueness follows from Lemma 10 and the last statement in the theorem
follows from Lemma 11.

4 Some special cases

In this section, we will present some special cases of Theorem 4. When F ≡ {0} and f ′ satisﬁes
a Lipschitz-type condition, we will obtain a particular instance of Theorem 4, which retrieves the
classical convergence theorem on Newton’s method under the Lipschitz condition; see [15, 19]. A
version of Smale’s theorem on Newton’s method for analytical functions is obtained in Theorem 13.

4.1 Under Lipschitz-type condition

In this section, we will present a version of classical convergence theorem for Newton’s method
under Lipschitz-type condition for generalized equations. The classical version for F ≡ {0} have
appeared in Rall [15] and Traub and Wozniakowski [19].
Theorem 12. Let H be a Hilbert space, Ω be an open nonempty subset of H, F : Ω → H be
continuous with Fr´echet derivative F ′ continuous, T : H ⇒ H be a set-valued operator and x∗ ∈ Ω.
Suppose that 0 ∈ F (x∗) + T (x∗), F ′(x∗) is a positive operator and \F ′(x∗)
exists and, there exists

a constant K > 0 such that

kkf ′(x) − f ′(y)k ≤ Kkx − yk,

x, y ∈ Ω.

(23)

Let r := min{κ, 2/(3K)}, where κ := sup{t > 0 : B(x∗, t) ⊂ Ω}. Then, the sequences with starting
point x0 ∈ B(x∗, r)/{x∗} and t0 = kx∗ − x0k, respectively,
F (xk)+F ′(xk)(xk+1−xk)+T (xk+1) ∋ 0,
are well deﬁned, {tk} is strictly decreasing, is contained in (0, r) and converges to 0, {xk} is con-
tained in B(x∗, r) and converges to the point x∗ which is the unique solution of F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 in
B(x∗, ¯σ), where ¯σ = min{r, 2/K}. Moreover, {tk+1/t2
k < 1/[2/K −

kx∗ − xk+1k ≤

If, additionally, 2/(3K) < κ, then r = 2/(3K) is the best possible convergence radius.

Proof. Using condition in (23), we can immediately prove that F , x∗ and f : [0, κ) → R, deﬁned by
f (t) = Kt2/2 − t, satisfy the inequality (4) and the conditions h1 and h2 in Theorem 4. In this
case, it is easy to see that ρ and ν, as deﬁned in Theorem 4, satisfy ρ = 2/(3K) ≤ ν = 1/K and,
as a consequence, r := min{κ, 2/(3K)}. Moreover, f (ρ)/(ρf ′(ρ)) − 1 = 1, f (0) = f (2/K) = 0 and
f (t) < 0 for all t ∈ (0, 2/K). Also, the sequence {tk} in Theorem 4 is given by (24) and

Therefore, the result follows by invoking Theorem 4.

Remark 3. The above result contain, as particular instance, several theorem on Newton’s method;
see, for example, Rall [15], Traub and Wozniakowski [19] and Daniel [3].

Remark 4. Since kx∗ − x0k ≤ 2/(3K), the last inequality in (25) implies that kx∗ − xk+1k ≤
3K/2kx∗ − xkk2 for k = 0, 1, . . . . Then, we conclude that

4.2 Under Smale’s-type condition

In this section, we will present a version of classical convergence theorem for Newton’s method under
Smale’s-type condition for generalized equations. The classical version has appeared in corollary of
Proposition 3 pp. 195 of Smale [18], see also Proposition 1 pp. 157 and Remark 1 pp. 158 of Blum,
Cucker, Shub, and Smale [1]; see also [9].

Theorem 13. Let H be a Hilbert space, Ω be an open nonempty subset of H, F : Ω → H be an
analytic function, T : H ⇒ H be a set-valued operator and x∗ ∈ Ω. Suppose that 0 ∈ F (x∗) + T (x∗),
F ′(x∗) is a positive operator and \F ′(x∗)

exists. Suppose that

Let r = min{κ, (5 − √17)/(4γ)}, where κ := sup{t > 0 : B(x∗, t) ⊂ Ω}. Then, the sequences with

0 in B(x∗, ¯σ), where ¯σ = min{r, 1/(2γ)}. Moreover, {tk+1/t2

Before proving above theorem we need of two results. The next results gives a condition that is
easier to check than condition (4), whenever the functions under consideration are twice continuously
diﬀerentiable, and its proof follows the same path of Lemma 21 of [?].

Lemma 14. Let Ω ⊂ H be an open set, and let F : Ω → H be an analytic function. Suppose that
x∗ ∈ Ω and B(x∗, 1/γ) ⊂ Ω, where γ is deﬁned in (26). Then for all x ∈ B(x∗, 1/γ), it holds that
kF ′′(x)k ≤ 2γ/(1 − γkx − x∗k)3.

The next result gives a relationship between the second derivatives F ′′ and f ′′, which allow us

to show that F and f satisfy (4), and its proof is similar to Lemma 22 of [?].

Lemma 15. Let H be a Hilbert space, Ω ⊆ H be an open set, F : Ω → H be twice continuously
diﬀerentiable. Let x∗ ∈ Ω, R > 0 and κ = sup{t ∈ [0, R) : B(x∗, t) ⊂ Ω}. Let f : [0, R) → R be
twice continuously diﬀerentiable such that k \F ′(x∗)
kkF ′′(x)k 6 f ′′(kx − x∗k), for all x ∈ B(x∗, κ),

−1

then F and f satisfy (4).

[Proof of Theorem 13]. Consider f : [0, 1/γ) → R deﬁned by f (t) = t/(1 − γt) − 2t. Note that f
is analytic and f (0) = 0, f ′(t) = 1/(1 − γt)2 − 2, f ′(0) = −1, f ′′(t) = 2γ/(1 − γt)3. It follows from
the last equalities that f satisﬁes h1 and h2. Combining Lemma 15 with Lemma 14, we conclude
that F and f satisfy (4). The constants, ν, ρ and r, as deﬁned in Theorem 4, satisfy

Moreover, f (ρ)/(ρf ′(ρ)) − 1 = 1 and f (0) = f (1/(2γ)) = 0 and f (t) < 0 for t ∈ (0, 1/(2γ)). Also,
{tk} satisfy

Therefore, the result follows by applying the Theorem 4.

5 Final remarks

We have obtained a local convergence result to Newton’s method for solving generalized equation
in Banach spaces and under the majorant condition. The majorant condition allow to unify several
convergece results pertaining to Newton’s method. In this sense, it would be interesting to study
this method using the regularity metric; see [7]. Besides, the study of semi local convergence and
inexact versions of this method would be welcome.
