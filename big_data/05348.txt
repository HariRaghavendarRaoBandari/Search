We consider the fate of a helical edge state of a spin Hall insulator and its topological transition in
presence of a circularly polarized light when coupled to various forms of environments. A Lindblad
type equation is developed to determine the fermion occupation of the Floquet bands. We ﬁnd by
using analytical and numerical methods that non-secular terms, corresponding to 2-photon transi-
tions, lead to a mixing of the band occupations, hence the light induced photocurrent is in general
not perfectly quantized in the presence of ﬁnite coupling to the environment, although deviations
are small in the adiabatic limit. Sharp crossovers are identiﬁed at frequencies Ω and 1
2 Ω (Ω is the
strength of light-matter coupling) with the former resembling to a phase transition.

INTRODUCTION

Topological

insulators (TI) are at the focus of at-
tention, representing peculiar states of matter with ro-
bust, topologically protected conducting edge or surface
states1,2. Due to the strongly entangled spin and charge
degrees of freedom, possible applications in spintronics
or quantum computation have been proposed.
In par-
ticular, the two-dimensional TI, i.e. the quantum spin-
Hall (QSH) state has been predicted and experimentally
observed for a number of systems, including graphene3,
HgTe/CdTe4,5 and InAs/GaSb6 quantum wells, lattice
models7–9 and multicomponent ultracold fermions in op-
tical lattices10–12.

While engineering topologically non-trivial band struc-
tures is far from being trivial, several methods have been
proposed to induce TIs. Among these, time periodic
driven quantum systems13 have been investigated by us-
ing Floquet theory14–16, the temporal analogue of Bloch
states. The resulting driven topological insulators are re-
ferred to as Floquet topological insulators. It has been
proposed that novel topological edge states can be in-
duced by irradiating electromagnetic waves on topologi-
cally trivial material such as a non-inverted HgTe/CdTe
quantum well17 or simply graphene13 that has no topo-
logically protected edge states in the absence of radiation.
Of further interest is the proposal by D´ora et al.
for a
quantized photocurrent in a quantum spin Hall (QSH)
and a topological phase transition to a non-quantized
photocurrent, when the frequency of the radiation ﬁeld
matches twice the energy of the Zeeman coupling, al-
tering the topological properties18. Besides the theoret-
ical appeal of Floquet TIs, the Floquet shadow bands
on the surface of a 3-dimensional TI Bi2Se3 have been
observed19 experimentally. In addition, photonic waveg-
uides have been used to simulate graphene interacting
with circularly polarized light, and the existence of edge
states was revealed20.

The steady state of Floquet topological insulators, is
described by the Floquet theory. Although the result-
ing Floquet spectrum often possesses a topology diﬀerent
from that of their static parents, the actual occupation of
the various Floquet bands is, however, essential to eval-
uate physical observables. For example, a topologically
non-trivial but only partially ﬁlled band cannot proﬁt
from topological protection. The occupation of the Flo-
quet bands is, in principle, determined by the sources
of relaxation, e.g. coupling to heat baths and phonons,
momentum scattering from static disorder, or interpar-
ticle interaction. In their absence, one can borrow from
the Floquet literature16 and assume fermion occupations,
which minimize the time averaged Hamiltonian, as was
done, e.g., in Refs. 18 and 21.

In the present work we extend the model for a driven
QSH system18 to include various types of environments.
In particular, we study a QSH insulator coupled to a
bosonic heat bath, and irradiated by a circularly polar-
ized light (see Eq. (1)). The electromagnetic ﬁeld acts
as a periodic driving as it couples the QSH edge states.

FIG. 1. The cartoon of the system, consisting of a QSH edge
state with spin ﬁltered conducting channels, interacting with
circularly polarized electromagnetic ﬁeld and coupled to an
environment, is visualized.

II. DISSIPATIVE CHIRAL EDGE STATES

WITH A PERIODIC DRIVE

We consider a one-dimensional chiral edge state of a
QSH insulator in a circularly polarized radiation ﬁeld,
shown in Fig. 1 described by the non-interacting Hamil-

tonian ˜HS = Pp ψ†
˜HS(p) = 1

˜HS(p) ψp, with
2 pσz − 1

p

2 Ω(σ+e−iωt + h.c.).

(1)

Here ψ†
p,σ creates a SQH edge excitation of momentum
p and spin σ, with 1
2 p is the energy of the right moving
spin up fermions, and − 1
2 p that of the left moving spin
down fermions (Fermi velocity is set to 1/2). The term
with Ω comes from the Zeeman coupling between the
magnetic component of the ω frequency electromagnetic
ﬁeld and the electron’s spin, and Ω is identiﬁed as the
Rabi frequency.

For the sake of simplicity, we shall assume in the fol-
lowing that excitations of the environment have a very
long wavelength compared to that of edge excitations,
and will also neglect the coupling it generates between
diﬀerent momenta. Under these conditions, we can re-
strict our considerations to a single momentum mode p,
which we then couple to the environment through

˜HSE = − 1

2 bxσxX − 1

2 byσyY − 1

2 bzσzZ .

(2)

Here X, Y and Z denote Gaussian bosonic ﬁelds, cou-
pled to the Pauli matrices, and bµ (µ ∈ {x, y, z}) denote
the corresponding couplings. Their dynamics is encoded
in the environment Hamiltonian, ˜HE = ˜HE(X, Y, Z),
whose explicit form is not needed here as it only deter-
mines the spectral functions of the noise. We refer to this
coupling scheme as the XYZ coupling. Below we consider
also other forms of ˜HSE, which are given by identifying
Y with X (the XXZ scheme), and both Y and Z with X
(referred to as XXX coupling).

The actual form of the system bath coupling depends
on the physical realization, but as we will show, in the
limit of weak coupling, they give similar results. The
environment is characterized by the bath spectral func-
tions Jµ=x,y,z(ω) = αω1−s
c ωse−ω/ωc, which determine the
correlation functions γµ(ω) = eβω
eβω−1 Jµ(ω) at arbitrary
temperature 1/β. The dimensionless quantity α is the
spectral strength and ωc is a high frequency cutoﬀ. An
Ohmic bath corresponds to s = 1, while s ≶ 1 describes
the sub- and super-Ohmic baths, respectively.

We reemphasize that, in our simpliﬁed model, each p
mode in Eq. (1) is coupled to a diﬀerent environmental
variable, and similarly to Ref. 23, the environment in-
duced scattering between diﬀerent momentum states is
neglected, an assumption that simpliﬁes the description
of the resulting state considerably.

Let us

start by reviewing the Floquet

solution
insulator and its basic

of the uncoupled topological

FIG. 2. Comparison of the edge current (in units of eΩ/2π))
when the states are occupied based on their average energy18,
and when they are coupled to a zero temperature bath. The
curves correspond to the secular approximation, which de-
scribes the inﬁnitesimal system-bath coupling. The s = 0
curve is understood as the limiting behavior as s → 0.

The system is schematically sketched in Fig. 1. For the
sake of simplicity, we consider a model with the simplest
possible form of a bosonic dissipation, where dissipation
does not couple states of diﬀerent momenta, but drives
spin ﬂip transitions.

Following the lines of Ref. 22, we apply a general-
ized Lindblad type formulation (the Bloch-Redﬁeld equa-
tions) to describe how the environment aﬀects the dy-
namics of the edge states.
In particular we keep non-
secular terms, which are not captured in the Lindblad
equation, but are found to aﬀect the dynamics consid-
erably. This requires, in general, a numerical solution,
though near critical points we ﬁnd that there is a single
dominant non-secular term that allows a rotation into a
time independent frame. We ﬁnd that the occupation of
the bands deviates from the one found using the aver-
age energy assumption,18,21 which leads to a weak vio-
lation of current quantization in the Floquet topological
phase. Our main result concerning the induced photocur-
rent along the edge is summarized in Fig. 2.

Other Floquet systems have also been studied in the
presence of disorder or dissipation23–31. Most of the for-
mer studies were related to driven graphene, showing
that dissipation eﬀects generally inhibit the naive gener-
alization of the static results on topological band struc-
tures to the Floquet case, due to the non-thermal occu-
pation of these bands. The eﬀect of non-secular terms in
graphene shined by circularly polarized light was studied
numerically after a quantum quench of the driving ﬁeld
in Ref.31, our method of analytical treatment of the dom-
inant resonances generalize to that case too, albeit we do
not consider quenches here.

After introducing the model and the Floquet solution
in the absence of heat bath in Sec II., we develop the
Lindblad formulation in Sec. III. and apply this formu-
lation to the edge states of a driven QSH system in Sec.
IV. We show numerical and approximate solutions to the
fermion occupation, then discuss the stationary edge cur-

properties18. The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation,
i∂tΨp(t) = ˜HS(p)Ψp(t),
is solved using the Floquet
ansatz14,16 for the steady state solution,

Ψp(t) = exp[−iE±(p)t]Φ±(p, t).

(3)

Here, E±(p) denotes the Floquet quasienergy, and
Φ±(p, t) = Φ±(p, t + T ) with T = 2π/ω,

where Ω′ = √δω2 + Ω2 is the renormalized Rabi fre-
quency and δω = ω − p denotes the detuning. The Flo-
quet quasienergies (4) are only well deﬁned modulo ω and
cannot be used to determine the ﬁlling of Floquet states.
A phenomenological way of determining ﬁlled Floquet
states21 relies on the average energy,16 deﬁned as

which is always single valued as opposed to the ladder
of quasienergies in Eq. (4). In the present work, we go
beyond this phenomenological reasoning and determine
the ﬁlling of the Floquet eigenstates from ﬁrst principles.

III. THE NON-SECULAR LINDBLAD

EQUATION

In this Section, we follow the lines of Refs. 32 and
22 to outline a theoretical framework to describe the
time dependent reduced density matrix by a generalized
Lindblad-type equation, up to 2nd order in the coupling
with an environment.

As a ﬁrst step, one switches to the interaction picture
with respect to the non-interacting Hamiltonians, H(t) =
˜HS(t) + ˜HE, where the time evolution of the interacting
system’s density matrix ρ(t) is governed simply by the
Hamiltonian HSE(t) which we factorize as
Aµ(t) ⊗ Bµ(t).

HSE(t) = Xµ

(7)

Here the operators Aµ(t) and Bµ(t) act on the system and
the environment, and their time evolution is governed by
˜HS(t) and ˜HE, respectively. To keep notation simple, we
suppress the index µ in what follows, and restore it only
in the ﬁnal results.

Within second order perturbation theory, the density
matrix factorizes as ρ(t) = ρS(t) ⊗ ρE, from the von
Neumann equation one derives the integral equation33,

˙ρS(t) ≈ Z t

with Γ(t) ≡ hB(t)B(0)iE the correlation function of the
operator B(t).
To proceed, one usually assumes that Γ(s) is short
ranged, and then makes a Markovian approximation,
ρS(t − s) → ρS(t).
(Keeping non-Markovian terms is
discussed in Appendix A.) Then, decomposing A(t) into
its eigenmodes of frequencies ν−j = −νj (and A†
j = A−j)

A(t) = Xj=−J,...,J

(11)

The generalized Lindblad’s equation (10) is the corner-
stone of our analysis, what we examine beyond the secu-
lar approximation.

Usually32,34–37 one makes an additional assumption of
keeping only secular terms with νj = νk, sometimes re-
ferred to as ”modiﬁed rotating wave approximation”38. In
this limit, terms proportional to Im˜Γ(νj) just renormalize
the subsystem’s Hamiltonian (produce a Lamb shift) and
can thus be dropped32, and a usual Lindblad equation is
recovered,

(12)

To appreciate the role of the non-secular terms assume
that an equilibrium solution ρeq is found for the secu-
lar Eq. (12), and that deviations from equilibrium de-
cay to it exponentially, δρ(t) ∼ δρ(0) exp(−Γt). Treat-
ing then the non-secular terms of Eq. (10) iteratively,
one can immediately see that they generate corrections
∝ 1/(i(νk − νj) + Γ), clearly demonstrating critical re-
gions with |νk − νj| . Γ. In these regions the non-secular

terms become important, and the secular approximation
fails.

Recovering the indices µ in Eq. (10), the time evolution

Eq. (13) upscales the frequencies of the non-secular os-
cillations. It is useful to expand the density matrix ρS(t)
in Pauli matrices as

nents, see Table I.

IV. APPLYING THE LINDBLAD EQUATION

TO THE EDGE STATE

Let us now combine the results of the previous sec-
tions to investigate the fate of the driven spin Hall sys-
tem coupled to an environment. We start by deriving the
time evolution operator for ˜HS(p). We note ﬁrst that
˜HS(p) becomes static in the rotating frame, i.e. using
2 iωtσz that yields the Hamilitonian
the transformation e
2 (p − ω)σz − 1
2 Ωσx. Next we rotate into the z axis by
2 iθσy where sin θ = −Ω/Ω′, cos θ = −δω/Ω′, leading to
e
the Hamiltonian H1
2 Ω′σz. Finally, the time evo-
2 iΩ′tσz , hence the total evolution
lution w.r.t. H1

We note that the conventional evolution operator is
2 iθσy (which is the identity at t = 0). For either
US(t)e
forms the interaction picture has HS(p) = 0, we ﬁnd the
form Eq. (14) to be more convenient.
Then we express ˜HSE in this rotated interaction pic-

ture as

HSE = Xj=±1,0

Az,je−iνj tZ(t) +

(15)

+ Xj=±2,±3,±4

Ax,je−iνj tX(t) + Ay,je−iνj tY (t)

with the operators and the corresponding frequencies in-
dicated in Table I. Having all operators Aµ,j at hand,
we can now proceed and construct the non-secular and
secular Lindbald equations, Eq. (10). and Eq. (12).

Equations (17) assume the form of standard Bloch equa-
tions in the interaction picture with equilibrium in the z
direction. We note that Γ↓, Γ↑ can also be derived by a
simpler Golden rule calculation35,36, in agreement with
our method. The results are the same for the XXZ and
the XXX coupling, excepting that in the former we have
to take γx = γy, and in the latter case γx = γy = γz.

The stationary value ρ0

z also gives the steady state oc-
cupation numbers of the eigenstates of the system Hamil-
tonian in the rotated frame H 1
Its two
eigenstates give also the nonequivalent Floquet states in
the laboratory frame39. The occupation of the state with
lower energy in the rotated frame is n−(p) = 1

At zero temperature a sharp diﬀerence shows up be-
tween the occupation proﬁles in the cases of small fre-
quency (ω < Ω) and large frequency driving, irrespective
of the actual type of the bosonic heat bath. In the for-
mer case Γ↑ ≡ 0, hence the steady state is described
by ﬁlling the lowest lying states of H 1
S(p). However, if
ω > Ω, there is a narrow domain in the momentum space
± = ω ± √ω2 − Ω2), where Γ↑ 6= 0, cor-
(p∗
respondingly the steady state contains excitations with
respect to the rotating frame Hamiltonian. Depending on
the spectral functions of the baths, inverse population is
achieved in this region, see FIG. 3.

A. Secular Lindblad equation

We can apply the secular approximation in the
limit, where all νj are suﬃciently diﬀerent relative to
linewidths. Moreover, for inﬁnitesimal system-bath cou-
pling, the secular approximation becomes exact. This
can be seen e.g. by noticing that rescaling time by α in

B. Beyond the secular approximation

The Bloch equations are rewritten as

dρ(t)

dt

= B(t)ρ(t) + b(t),

(19)

5

The full numerical solution of the Eq. (19), together
with various approximate results are shown in Fig. 4, vi-
sualizing the momentum dependence of the average value
of ρz in the Ohmic case. Note that ρz can become smaller
than −1/2, which is a common feature in other non-
secular approaches as well22. The secular approximation
clearly breaks down at certain momenta, and is outper-
formed by the DFA there. 41

Despite the several Fourier coeﬃcients appearing in
ρ(t), the spins exhibit periodic oscillations in the lab-
oratory frame with frequency ω and higher harmonics.
Indeed, switching back to the Schr¨odinger picture ( ˜ρ(t))
after applying the Markovian approximation on Eq. (8)
results in a diﬀerential equation, which only involves fre-
quencies 0, ω and its higher harmonics (Ω′ aﬀects only
coeﬃcients via the s integration). This is favorable for
numerical calculations but is also disadvantageous for an-
alytical treatment compared to the interaction picture,
which gives a natural ground to investigate the reso-
nances and provides approximate solutions for the time
evolution of the density matrix.

V. PHOTOCURRENT ALONG THE EDGE

Armed with the knowledge of the density matrix, we
now focus on measurable quantities. Due to the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld, a net electric current and magnetization
due to the magnetoelectric eﬀect1 is induced along the
edge. Without the environment18, this current was found
to be quantized based in the average energy concept
in the adiabatic limit, giving way to dissipative charge
transport through a topological transition with increas-
ing frequency ω. The photocurrent along the edge of a
spin-Hall insulator in the laboratory frame is determined
2 σz}, which is expressed by the

components of ρ in the interaction picture as

2π Tr{ ˜ρ(t) 1

j = eZ Λ

dp
2π

−Λ

δω
Ω′ ρz −

Ω
Ω′ (ρx cos Ω′t − ρy sin Ω′t) , (22)

2 , yielding jc = eω

which inherits the 2π/ω periodicity from ˜ρ(t). In the sec-
ular approximation only the DC component survives, as
ρx,y = 0 and ρz is time independent. In the low frequency
limit (ω < Ω) ρz ≡ − 1
2π , which we
call the quantized value following Ref.18. When ω > Ω,
there are regions where ρz deviates from − 1
2 (Figs. 3,4),
implying the breakdown of the quantization. Near the
critical point the deviation form the quantized current is
∆j = j − jc ∼ (ω − Ω)s+3/2, with the exponent depend-
ing on the low frequency asymptotics of the bath spectral
function.

The current obtains ∼ α corrections to the secular ap-
proximation due to the non-secular terms, and the quan-
tization of the current ceases to be exact at ﬁnite system-
bath couplings (FIG. 5(a,b)). The corrections have dual
origin. On the one hand, due to photon absorption res-
onances near ω ≈ 1

functions J(ν). The excitations in the steady state are with
stronger weight in the sub-Ohmic (s = 0) case compared to
Ohmic (s = 1) or super-Ohmic environments (s = 2).

aµ,j can be identiﬁed from TABLE I. In the secular ap-
proximation only the j = k terms are kept, i.e. only ˜B(0)
and ˜b(0). The frequencies appearing in the above expan-
sions in the XYZ and XXZ cases are ±(0, Ω′, 2ω, Ω′±2ω)
in b(t), and ±(0, Ω′, 2Ω′, 2ω, Ω′± 2ω, 2(Ω′± ω)) in B(t).
In the XXX case, additional frequencies ±(ω, Ω′ ± ω) to
b(t) and ±(ω, Ω′±ω, 2Ω′±ω) to B(t) appear. For the full
solution of the problem, all these terms should be taken
into account, which is easy to implement numerically.
Generally, all the above Fourier components appear in
the time evolution of the density matrix, ρx and ρy oscil-
late around 0, while ρz oscillates around a ﬁnite station-
ary value. The secular approximation works well if none
of these frequencies are close to zero. In the case when
one of these frequencies nearly vanish, the stationary val-
ues are tuned away from the secular ones. The possibly
dangerous terms that can vanish at certain momenta,
possess frequencies as ν∗ = Ω′ − ω and ν∗∗ = Ω′ − 2ω.
40 When these frequencies become small, the deviation
from the secular approximation grows, which appears as
a peak in the stationary components of ρ(p).

In the vicinity of these points, analytical solutions are
possible within the Dominant Frequency Approximation
(DFA). When the frequency of some non-secular terms
approaches zero, it drives the solution away from the sec-
ular one. The single smallest frequency appearing among
the non-secular terms is the dominant one. Keeping this
single frequency, Eq. (13) can be transformed to a time
independent equation, that is readily solved, as detailed
in the Appendix.

transitions, where the Floquet bands touch each other (lower panel). (b) At lower frequency (Ω > ω > 1
2 Ω) only one dangerous
non-secular term survives, giving rise to peaks at p∗∗
2 Ω the secular approximation still gets corrections because
the dangerous frequency Ω′ − 2ω is small at p ≈ ω. The actual values of ω/Ω are 1.1 in (a), 0.75 in (b) and 0.48 in (c).

ω < Ω. On the other hand, the x, y components of the
density matrix acquire oscillations at frequency Ω′, which
also contribute to the DC current in Eq. (22). The res-
onances produce a sharp breakdown in the current at
ω ≈ 1
2 Ω due to a dangerous non-secular term present in
the XXZ and XXX cases. This behavior is captured in
the DFA. FIG. 5(b) shows the crossover at ω ∼ 1
2 Ω due
to the Ω′ − 2ω ≈ 0 resonance, and also the eﬀect of the
Ω′ − ω ≈ 0 resonance on the DC current. The DFA with
frequencies Ω′ − ω and Ω′ − 2ω cannot yield nonzero Ω′
ﬂuctuations. To describe the eﬀect of the second term
in Eq. (22), one has to study the DFA with frequency
Ω′ (FIG.5(b)). The deviations of the DFA with diﬀerent
frequencies compared to the secular approximation are
approximately additive, and one can combine them to
achieve a good approximation for the total DC current.
At ﬁnite system-bath coupling, in addition to the DC
component, the stationary current is also characterized
by nonvanishing AC contributions, showing peaks as a
function of ω (FIG. 5(c)). The ω frequency Fourier com-
ponent of the current originates from the ω, Ω′±ω Fourier
terms in ρ(t), which are present only in the XXX cou-
pling. The 2ω and Ω′±2ω components of ρ(t) are respon-
sible for the 2ω harmonic AC current, which therefore is
present in the XXZ and XXX couplings. The XYZ cou-
pling does not show any alternating current.

In general, ﬁnite temperature also breaks down the
quantization of the current. However, in the special case
of bx = by = 0, when the occupation is thermal, the
current remains quantized even at ﬁnite temperature. It
is also worth mentioning that in this case there are no
critical points at all (see e.g. ρ0
z together with the deﬁni-
tions of Γ↑,↓, and also TABLE I), and the quantization
remains valid for all frequencies.

The integrated expectation value of σz determines both
the current and the z component of the edge magnetiza-

in the cutoﬀ parameter Λ. The crossovers in ρz as a
function of ω are also revealed in transverse magnetiza-
tion, which can be highlighted by subtracting the low fre-
quency transverse magnetization Mc as a reference value
(FIG. 6). In the XXX and XXZ cases the magnetization
acquires a ﬁnite 3ω component due to the Ω′ ± 2ω com-
ponents of ρ, and the Ω′ − ω resonance in the XXX case
gives rise to a ﬁnite static magnetization in the xy plane
together with the second harmonic (FIG. 6(c)).

VI. CONCLUSION

We have investigated the fate of a spin-Hall edge
state, coupled to dissipative environment, in the pres-
ence of circularly polarized electromagnetic ﬁeld. With-
out the environment, the Floquet solution of the prob-
lem features an electromagnetic ﬁeld induced photocur-
rent, being quantized in the adiabatic regime42 and cross-
ing over to dissipative charge transport with increasing
frequency18. These results were obtained using the av-
erage energy concept for the occupation of the Floquet
steady state. In the presence of dissipation, the ﬁlling of
the Floquet states is determined by a Lindblad equation,
which we investigate both analytically and numerically.
The photocurrent is only quantized in the strict adiabatic
limit in the presence of ﬁnite bath coupling. Neverthe-
less, deviations from perfect quantization in the adiabatic
regime are tiny, as shown in Fig. 2, and perfect quanti-
zation is recovered in the limit of vanishing coupling to
the environment. With increasing frequency, deviations
grow and the photocurrent becomes dissipative in nature.
Our results show that couplings to environments are es-
sential for treating Floquet systems and that these can
be identiﬁed by measuring DC as well as AC observables
of the system.

40 Note1, in principle 2Ω′ − ω could be dangerous as well, but
it becomes unimportant due to vanishing matrix elements.
41 Note2, in the secular approximation only the real part of
˜Γ(ν) appears in the stationary solution, correspondingly it
behaves well for any values of s, even for the white noise
limiting case (s = 0) of the sub-Ohmic regime. However, if
non-secular terms are considered, one cannot neglect the
imaginary parts. If s = 0, Im˜Γ(ν) diverges logarithmically
for small frequency, which also implies unphysical station-
ary states with diverging components of the density ma-
trix. This divergence originates from the extension of the
upper limit of the integral in the Bloch-Redﬁeld equation
to ∞ in Eq. (8). Without extending the integral to ∞, the
equation can be used to study the short time dynamics in
the s = 0 case, but it cannot describe the stationary state.

To test the Markovian approximation, we solved numerically the above integro-diﬀerential equation with Heun’s
method (a two-stage predictor-corrector method), and compared the solution with the Markovian approximation
(FIG. 7). There is a very small quantitative diﬀerence in the stationary states, but the qualitative picture does not
change.

Appendix B: Dominant frequency approximation (DFA)

We observe that the operators Aµ,j in TABLE I are either proportional to σ± or to σz, thus they obtain only a phase
factor under a rotation around the z axis. The secular terms always consist of an operator Aµ,j and its hermitian
2 iνtσz . On the other hand, the non-secular terms

acquire a phase factor, which allow us to transform the dominant frequency term to be time independent, without
spoiling the secular terms.

in the Schr¨odinger picture).

In the U (1) symmetric XYZ case there are no dangerous non-secular terms, and the full time evolution can be
mapped to be exactly time independent applying the method described above with νd = Ω′. This yields an analytical
solution for the stationary fermion occupations.

The U (1) breaking XYZ and XXZ case has a single dangerous non-secular term corresponding to the frequency ν∗∗

(because ν∗ does not enter in B(t) and b(t)). This vanishes if ω > 1
giving rise to peaks in the stationary values of ρz and ρ⊥. In contrast to the singularity in the secular solution at
ω = Ω, these peaks grow up gradually as ω is increased, and are also present in the ω < 1
2 Ω case (see FIG. 4(c) for the
same phenomenon in XXX case). We note that Eq. (B1) is in the most general form, and it simpliﬁes for νd = ν∗∗ as
δ ≡ 0 in this case.

approximation. The contribution of the dominant frequency terms is that additional peaks grow at p∗

the secular solution of ρz and ρ⊥ (FIG. 4(a)). In principle the frequency ν∗∗∗ = Ω′ − 1
2 ω could be dangerous as well,
but the matrix elements χ = β1,2 ≡ 0 at this frequency. Because of the vanishing matrix elements, it does not change
the secular behavior, see e.g. Eq. (B1).
An equivalent way to look at the DFA is to take the Fourier transform of Eq. (19), which maps the diﬀerential equa-
˜B(ωi − ωj) ˜ρ(ωj) + ˜b(ωi). The approximation is to
keep only the dominant frequency νd in the expansion of ˜ρ, neglecting the higher harmonics as well. The generalization
to keep more (dominant) frequencies is straightforward in this language, but analytically hardly treatable.
