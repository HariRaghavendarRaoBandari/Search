Abstract—WiFi ofﬂoading, where mobile device users (e.g.,
smart phone users) transmit packets through WiFi networks
rather than cellular networks,
is a promising solution to al-
leviating the heavy trafﬁc burden of cellular networks due to
data explosion. However, since WiFi networks are intermittently
available, a mobile device user in WiFi ofﬂoading usually needs
to wait for WiFi connection and thus experiences longer delay
of packet transmission. To motivate users to participate in WiFi
ofﬂoading, cellular network operators give incentives (rewards
like coupons, e-coins) to users who wait for WiFi connection and
transmit packets through WiFi networks.

In this paper, we aim at maximizing users’ rewards while
meeting constraints on queue stability and energy consumption.
However, we face scheduling challenges from random packet
arrivals, intermittent WiFi connection and time varying wireless
link states. To address these challenges, we ﬁrst
formulate
the problem as a stochastic optimization problem. We then
propose an optimal scheduling policy, named Optimal scheduling
Policy under Energy Constraint (OPEC), which makes online
decisions as to when to delay packet transmission to wait for
WiFi connection and which wireless link (WiFi link or cellular
link) to transmit packets on. OPEC automatically adapts to
random packet arrivals and time varying wireless link states,
not requiring a priori knowledge of packet arrival and wireless
link probabilities. As veriﬁed by simulations, OPEC scheduling
policy can achieve the maximum rewards while keeping queue
stable and meeting energy consumption constraint.

I. INTRODUCTION

With the explosion of smart devices (like smart phones,
tablets) in daily life, mountainous data (like high resolution
photos and videos) have been generated every day. Global mo-
bile data trafﬁc has already reached 3.7 exabytes per month at
the end of 2015 and will be 30.6 exabytes per month by 2020,
i.e., eightfold increase, according to the report of Cisco [1].
As a result, cellular networks are overloaded, which degrades
users’ quality of experience (we already experienced long
delay, low throughput during peak hours in crowded downtown
areas [2]). To improve users’ quality of experience, cellular
network operators struggle to increase network connection
speeds. However, deploying more cellular infrastructures (like
base stations) is very expensive and cannot bring reasonable
beneﬁts. Recently, ofﬂoading mobile data trafﬁc from cellular
networks to WiFi networks of low cost and high connection
speed (known as WiFi ofﬂoading) has been proposed as a
promising solution to alleviating the heavy trafﬁc burden of
cellular networks [2], [3].

Fig. 1.

Illustration of participants in WiFi ofﬂoading.

Participants in WiFi ofﬂoading include cellular network
operators (cellular Base Station (BS)), WiFi Access Point (AP)
owners and mobile device users, as shown in Figure 1. In
such a network, mobile device users leverage loose delay
requirement of delay-tolerant applications (e.g., uploading
photos and videos to iCloud/youtube, synchronizing dropbox)
to postpone packet transmission for utilizing intermittent WiFi
connection. While cellular network operators can beneﬁt from
WiFi ofﬂoading, both WiFi AP owners and users may suf-
fer from bad quality of experience: WiFi AP owners need
to sacriﬁce WiFi bandwidth and energy to offer ofﬂoading
services and users need to delay packet transmission to wait
for intermittent WiFi connection. To motivate WiFi AP owners
to provide WiFi ofﬂoading services and users to utilize WiFi
ofﬂoading services, incentive frameworks have been proposed
recently (see Section II for related work), where cellular
network operators give rewards to WiFi AP owners and users
to compensate for their loss. However, these frameworks focus
on maximizing the utility of network operators (related to
operators’ satisfaction, e.g., minimizing operators’ incentive
cost) rather than mobile device users. Further, they do not
take into account limited battery power of mobile devices.

In this paper, we aim at maximizing users’ rewards in
incentive WiFi ofﬂoading under constraint on energy con-
sumption of mobile devices. However, to achieve this goal,
we face scheduling challenges from random packet arrivals,

intermittent WiFi connection and time varying wireless link
states. To address these challenges, we ﬁrst formulate the
problem as a stochastic optimization problem with constraint
on average energy consumption and queue stability (deﬁned
later). We then propose an optimal scheduling policy, named
Optimal scheduling Policy under Energy Constraint (OPEC),
which makes online decisions as to when to delay packet
transmission to wait for WiFi connection and which wireless
link (WiFi
link or cellular link) to transmit packets on.
OPEC automatically adapts to random packet arrivals and time
varying wireless link states, not requiring a priori knowledge
of packet arrival and wireless link probabilities. As veriﬁed
by simulations, OPEC scheduling policy can achieve the
maximum rewards while keeping queue stable and meeting
energy consumption constraint.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we review related work on incentive WiFi ofﬂoading and
scheduling policies under energy constraint. We introduce
network models and assumptions for WiFi ofﬂoading system
in Section III. We give a formulation of the optimal scheduling
problem in Section IV and present a detailed description of
OPEC scheduling policy in Section V. Simulation results to
verify OPEC are presented in Section VI and the whole paper
is concluded in Section VII.

II. RELATED WORK

To motivate users to delay their packet transmissions for
ofﬂoading cellular trafﬁc to complementary networks (DTNs
and WiFi hotspots), Zhuo et al. [4] proposed an incentive
framework named ”Win-Coupon,” in which cellular network
operators provide users incentives (service discount coupon).
Their objective is to minimize the incentive cost of cellular
network operators.

A similar work [5], which also motivates users to ofﬂoad
cellular trafﬁc to WiFi networks, proposed an incentive mech-
anism to allow network operators to optimally award users,
but differs from [4] in how network operators negotiate an
ofﬂoading contract with users.

Instead of motivating users, Kang et al. [6] aim to motivate
WiFi Access Point (AP) owners to provide data ofﬂoading
services for network operators. They proposed an incentive
mechanism, where network operators award WiFi AP owners
based on both the amount of data ofﬂoading services and
service quality they provide. This work also focuses on max-
imizing network operators’ utility.

Iosiﬁdis et al. [7] discussed the challenges of designing
incentive schemes to encourage WiFi AP owners to participate
in offering data ofﬂoading services (such networks are called
user-provided networks in [7]). They pointed out that energy
consumption and cost for providing and receiving ofﬂoading
services are critical to incentive scheme designs.

However, all above works [4]–[6] focused on maximizing
the utility of network operators rather than users and they
did not consider the issue of energy consumption of mobile
devices, which is a major concern to all battery-powered
mobile devices. Different from [4]–[6], our goal in this paper

is to maximize rewards of users under energy consumption
constraint.

There are also some works considering energy consumption
issues in ofﬂoading cellular trafﬁc. Ra et al. [8] studied
the tradeoff between energy consumption and data delay in
WiFi ofﬂoading networks. They proposed an algorithm that
can achieve the minimum energy consumption under queue
stability constraint. However, they did not consider incentive
issue and their objective is different from ours.

Al-Kanj et al. [9] investigated how to ofﬂoad cellular trafﬁc
under energy consumption constraint on mobile devices in
multihop ad hoc networks. Their objective is to minimize the
usage of scarce cellular spectrum, which is different from the
goal of our work.

Recently, Onoue et al. [10] considered reducing data delay
in WiFi ofﬂoading networks under energy consumption con-
straint. The idea is that a user prefetches the data to be used
before he leaves WiFi network coverage. Therefore, the user
can obtain the data immediately when he leaves WiFi coverage
without waiting for next WiFi connection, thus reducing data
delay. However, they did not consider incentive issues.

III. NETWORK MODELS

In this section, we introduce network models for WiFi
ofﬂoading system concerning network time, packet arrival
process, wireless links, rewards and energy consumption. Key
notations are summarized in Table I.

Network time: In a WiFi ofﬂoading network as illustrated
in Figure 1, network time is divided into time slots t of equal
duration, t = 0, 1, 2, · · · . For example, one time slot could be
duration of 20 seconds.

Packet arrival process and queue: Packets arrive at the
mobile device following a general stochastic process {a(t); t ≥
0}, where a(t) is the number of packets arriving at the mobile
device at
time slot t. We assume a(t) has ﬁnite second
moment for any t, E{a(t)2} < ∞. All arriving packets will be
stored in a queue of the mobile device awaiting for wireless
transmission. Denote by Q(t) the number of packets in the
queue at the beginning of time slot t.

Wireless links: If a mobile device is connected through a
wireless channel to either a cellular base station (BS) or a
WiFi access point (AP), we say a wireless link is available
for the mobile device. We assume at most n > 0 wireless
links are available for the mobile device every time slot t,
including 1 cellular wireless link and n − 1 WiFi wireless
links. The state of a wireless link at slot t (i.e., how many
packets can be transmitted by that link at slot t) is a random
variable and varies from time slot to time slot, due to factors
like user mobility, interference and wireless channel fading.
Denote the states of n wireless links at slot t by a vector

S(t) = (cid:0)S1(t), S2(t), · · · , Sn(t)(cid:1), where vector element S1(t)

is the state of the cellular wireless link (i.e., at most S1(t)
packets can be transmitted by cellular link at slot t) and
Si(t), 2 ≤ i ≤ n, is the state of WiFi wireless link i (at
most Si(t) packets can be transmitted by WiFi link i at slot
t).

Transmission decision: At each time slot t, the mobile
device makes a transmission decision from the following n+1
decision options:

D1: delaying packet

transmission (i.e., not

transmitting

packets at slot t),

D2: transmitting packets by the cellular link,
D3: transmitting packets by a WiFi link i, 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
We assume the mobile device can transmit packets by at
most one wireless link at a time slot. Denote by D the set of
all n+1 possible transmission decisions. Denote a transmission

decision at slot t by vector α(t) = (cid:0)α1(t), α2(t), · · · , αn(t)(cid:1),

IV. OPTIMAL SCHEDULING PROBLEM FORMULATION

Our goal is to maximize user rewards under energy con-
sumption constraint (deﬁned later) in incentive WiFi ofﬂoading
network. In this section, we formulate the problem as a
stochastic optimization problem [11].

We ﬁrst deﬁne how queue Q(t) evolves, when queue Q(t)
is said to be stable and quantities concerning time average
expectations of packet arrivals, energy consumption, transmis-
sion capacity and rewards.

Queue dynamics: Under transmission policy π ∈ P, the

queue in the mobile device evolves as follows:

Q(t + 1) = max(cid:2)Q(t) − bπ(t), 0(cid:3) + a(t)

(5)

Queue stability: The queueing process Q(t) is mean rate

stable [11] if

lim

E(cid:8)|Q(t)|(cid:9)

t

= 0

(6)

Time average expectations: For transmission policy π ∈

P, we deﬁne the following time average expectations:

E{pπ(τ )}

E{bπ(τ )}

is named Optimal scheduling Policy under Energy Constraint
(OPEC), OPEC ∈ P.

We need several deﬁnitions in describing OPEC. First,
deﬁne a virtual queueing process {Z(t); t ≥ 0}, which is used
in OPEC to meet the average energy consumption constraint
(18). The virtual queueing process evolves as follows:

Z(t + 1) = max(cid:2)Z(t) + yOP EC (t), 0(cid:3),

(21)

where yOP EC (t) is deﬁned in (16) and we assume the initial
conditions Z(0) ≥ 0 and E{Z(0)2} < ∞ 1.

E{rπ(τ )}

(10)

Then, deﬁne the following auxiliary quantities for transmis-
sion decision option α(t) ∈ D, which will help OPEC in
making decisions.

Note that 0 ≤ rπ(t) ≤ 1 from deﬁnition (4).

Optimal scheduling problem formulation: In the consid-
ered incentive WiFi ofﬂoading network, our objective is to
propose a scheduling policy to maximize the time average ex-
pected rewards while meeting energy consumption constraint
pav, 0 < pav < ∞, (12) and queue stability constraint (13). We
formulate this problem as a stochastic optimization problem

The full description of OPEC policy is given in Algorithm

it

Basic idea of OPEC: To meet queue stability constraint
(19),
is sufﬁcient for one policy to greedily minimize
−Q(t)b(t) every time slot t as proved in [11] (b(t), f (t), y(t)
are deﬁned in Algorithm 1). Similarly, to meet the constraint
on average energy consumption (18), it sufﬁces to greedily
minimize Z(t)y(t) every time slot t [11]. Thus,
to meet
both constraints (19) and (18), OPEC greedily minimizes
−Q(t)b(t) + Z(t)y(t) every time slot t. Since our ﬁnal goal is
to minimize objective function (17) while meeting constraints
(18)-(20), OPEC also needs to consider f (t). To account for
f (t), OPEC minimizes a weighted sum V f (t) − Q(t)b(t) +
Z(t)y(t) every time slot t.

Control parameter V measures the importance of getting
rewards: larger V means we prefer getting more rewards,
which comes at the cost of an increase in queue size Q(t).
Thus, by controlling V we can achieve a tradeoff between
queue size and rewards. It can be proved, by Lyapunov
optimization theory [11], that OPEC policy indeed achieves
(t) while meeting constraints
the minimum limit value of f
(18)-(20) by greedily minimizing the above weighted sum.

VI. SIMULATION VALIDATION

In this section, we verify our OPEC scheduling policy by

simulations.

A. Simulation settings

For simulating the considered WiFi ofﬂoading network,
we developed a customized simulator, which takes as inputs
packet arrival process {a(t); t ≥ 0}, maximum number of
wireless links n, stochastic process of wireless link states S(t),
energy consumption pc, pw, energy consumption constraint
pav and control parameter V . By conﬁguring these parameters,
we can simulate a wide range of network scenarios.

For illustration purpose, we consider a network scenario

with the following network settings.

• The number a(t) of packets arriving at the queue for
any time slot t ≥ 0 is an Independent and Identically
Distributed (IID) random variable, where P r{a(t) =
0} = 0.2, P r{a(t) = 2} = 0.3, P r{a(t) = 3} = 0.5.

• There are at most two wireless links (n = 2) available

every time slot: one cellular link and one WiFi link.

• Wireless link state vector S(t) is an IID vector random
variable over time slots. Since cellular network is of low
data rates and almost always available, we set cellular
link states and probabilities as P r{S1(t) = 0} =
0.1, P r{S1(t) = 1} = 0.2, P r{S1(t) = 2} = 0.7.

Since WiFi network is of high data rates and intermit-
tently available, we set WiFi link states and probabil-
ities as P r{S2(t) = 0} = 0.7, P r{S2(t) = 2} =
0.05, P r{S2(t) = 4} = 0.05, P r{S2(t) = 10} =
0.1, P r{S2(t) = 20} = 0.1.

• For energy consumption, we set pc = 1.15 J/slot when
transmitting by cellular link and pc = 1.1 J/slot when
transmitting by WiFi link. Constraint on average energy
consumption is set to be pav = 0.8 J/slot.

We vary control parameter V in our simulations and examine
its impact on performance metrics like time average queue
size Q, time average rewards rOP EC and time average energy
consumption pOP EC deﬁned below

B. Simulation results

After running simulations for 106 slots (i.e., 11.5 days if 1
slot is equal to 1 second) under different settings of V , we
collected data of Q(t), rOP EC (t), pOP EC (t) and calculated
their time averages Q, rOP EC , pOP EC, as summarized in

Fig. 2. Time average energy consumption pOP EC vs. control parameter V .

We ﬁrst check whether OPEC satisﬁes the constraint on
average energy consumption. Figure 2 shows the simulated
results on pOP EC as V increases from 1 to 200. From Figure
2, we can see that
the time average energy consumption
pOP EC under OPEC scheduling policy is always less than
the constraint pav = 0.8 J/slot. Thus, OPEC meets the given

constraint on average energy consumption. Further observation
of Figure 2 shows that as V increases, pOP EC decreases and
approaches a limit value 0.32, indicating that with constraints
on queue stability and average energy consumption, there
exists a minimum value pmin of average energy consumption
for the considered WiFi ofﬂoading network. That is to say, the
average energy consumption constraint pav should be larger
than pmin, otherwise no scheduling policy can meet average
energy consumption constraint while keeping queue stable.

increases. From Figure 3, we can see that the time average
queue size Q under OPEC scheduling policy increases as V
increases and tends to reach a limit value that is less than

14. As a common practice, we estimate E(cid:8)|Q(t)|(cid:9) by time

average Q. Therefore,

Thus, OPEC also meets the constraint of queue being mean
rate stable.

Finally, we check whether OPEC can achieve the maximum
average reward 1. Figure 4 shows simulated results on rOP EC
as V increases. We can see from the ﬁgure that average
reward rOP EC under OPEC scheduling policy increases as V
increases and reaches the optimal value 1, thus verifying that
OPEC can indeed achieve the maximum average reward 1. In
summary, by simulations we validated that OPEC scheduling
policy can achieve the maximum average rewards while satis-
fying constraints on queue stability and energy consumption.

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we focused on maximizing users’ rewards
in incentive WiFi ofﬂoading under energy consumption con-
straint. We proposed a ﬂexible scheduling policy, called Op-

timal scheduling Policy under Energy Constraint (OPEC).
As validated by simulation, OPEC can achieve the maxi-
mum rewards while keeping queue stable and meeting en-
ergy consumption constraint. One merit of OPEC is that it
automatically adapts to random packet arrivals, intermittent
WiFi connection and time varying wireless link states, not
requiring a priori knowledge of packet arrival and wireless link
probabilities. As a future work, we will consider ofﬂoading
cellular trafﬁc by multiple complementary networks, such as
WiFi, WiMax and Femtocell networks.
