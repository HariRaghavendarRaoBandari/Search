There are non–vanishing price responses across diﬀerent stocks in correlated ﬁnancial markets.
We further study this issue by performing diﬀerent averages, which identify active and passive cross–
responses. The two average cross–responses show diﬀerent characteristic dependences on the time
lag. The passive cross–response exhibits a shorter response period with sizeable volatilities, while
the corresponding period for the active cross–response is longer. The average cross–responses for
a given stock are evaluated either with respect to the whole market or to diﬀerent sectors. Using
the response strength, the inﬂuences of individual stocks are identiﬁed and discussed. Moreover,
the various cross–responses as well as the average cross–responses are compared with the self–
responses. In contrast, the short memory of trade sign cross–correlation for stock pairs, the sign
cross–correlation has long memory when averaged over diﬀerent pairs of stocks.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the impact of stock trades on price
change has attracted considerable interest [1–11]. Most
of these studies focus on single stocks, because there is a
high self–correlation of order ﬂow [3, 12–14]. In addition
to many stylized facts and speciﬁc features [1, 2, 15–21],
the order ﬂow exhibits remarkable persistence. Buy (sell)
orders are often followed by more buy (sell) orders, lead-
ing to a long–memory self–correlation of trade signs [13].
This is so, because the traders prefer to split large orders
into smaller fragments to conceal their trading intentions
and to keep the liquidity costs as low as possible. This
self–correlation of the order ﬂow generates the stock price
self–response to the trades. The price is determined by a
continuous double auction [22] with market and limit or-
ders. The market orders are executed immediately at the
best available price. Although they do not appear in the
order book, they either keep the quote unchanged when
the trading volumes are smaller than the market depth or
move the price up (down) if they are buyer– (seller–) ini-
tiated. On the other hand the limit orders are executed
at the price the traders speciﬁed, which is a process that
takes time. They are listed in the order book as quotes,
i.e. bids and asks, corresponding to the buy and sell limit
orders, respectively. The prices change persistently when
buy or sell market orders come in, since they remove vol-
umes of the limit orders from the order book and push
the price from the best quote to a secondary quote.

Recently, we studied the price cross–response in a cor-
related market [11]. Due to impact mechanisms diﬀer-
ent from the self–response, the cross–response as well as
the cross–correlation of trade signs strongly suﬀers from
noise, leading to drastic ﬂuctuations at large time lags.
The sign cross–correlation was thus found to have short
memory. For the cross–response, a given stock is related

to several or many others. That is partly due to economic
dependencies of the companies and to the grouping of
investments in portfolios, but there may also be other
reasons for the mutual impact. Suppose, for example,
a trader who considers a stock as presently underpriced
and likely to raise in the near future. To buy many shares
of this stock he might use the proﬁt from selling other
stocks. If many others act correspondingly, an impact re-
sults: buying (selling) this stock aﬀects the other stocks
which are sold (bought). By discussing this scenario, we
want to motivate that averaging the cross–response func-
tions over diﬀerent stocks that are paired with the same
stock can yield interesting new observations. Further-
more, such averages will also to some extent smoothen
the drastic ﬂuctuations of the sign cross–correlations at
large time lags and reduce the cross–response noise. We
thus introduce the average cross–responses of an individ-
ual stock to the whole market and to diﬀerent economic
sectors. In this setting, we also further discuss the inﬂu-
ences of individual stocks.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. II, we rep-
resent the data sets used for the evaluation of empirical
cross–responses and give our deﬁnition of the trade signs.
In Sect. III, we introduce the average cross–responses, a
passive and an active one, as well as the corresponding
cross–correlators of trade signs, and we discuss the inﬂu-
ence of zero trade signs. In Sect. IV, we analyze the aver-
age cross–responses of an individual stock to the market
and to diﬀerent economic sectors where the two possi-
ble deﬁnitions, in– and excluding the zero trade signs,
are taken into account. Investigating the average cross–
responses, we identify in Sect. V the inﬂuencing and in-
ﬂuenced stocks, and analyze the rank diﬀerence of in-
ﬂuencing stocks with respect to the cross–response. In
Sect. VI, we compare the self–response with the various
cross–responses. We conclude in Sect. VII.

II. DATA DESCRIPTION AND SIGN

DEFINITIONS

To make this paper self–contained, we brieﬂy sketch
those salient features of Ref. [11] which are also needed
in the present study. In Sect. II A, we present the data
set that we use in our analysis. In Sect. II B we give our
deﬁnition of the trade signs on the physical time scale.

A. Data set

We use the Trades and Quotes (TAQ) data set from
NASDAQ stock market of the year 2008. Since the NAS-
DAQ is a purely electronic stock exchange, the informa-
tion of the stock in each year, such as the trading time,
prices and volumes, is conveniently recorded in the TAQ
data set. It includes two separate ﬁles. One is the trades
ﬁle with the information of all successive transactions.
The other one is the quotes ﬁle containing all successive
best buy and sell limit orders.

For a stock pair (i, j), only the common trading days
are taken into account, because an intraday price cross–
response does not occur if one of the stocks is not traded
on a given day. Moreover, to avoid artifacts related to the
dramatic price ﬂuctuations at the opening and closing of
the market and to overnight eﬀects, the trading time we
consider for all stocks is from 9:40:00 to 15:50:00 New
York local time.

For the average cross–responses of an individual stock
in Sect. IV, Apple Inc. (AAPL), Goldman Sachs Group
(GS), and Exxon Mobil Corp.
(XOM) are selected as
sample stocks, where AAPL belongs to the economic sec-
tor of Information technology, GS belongs to Financials,
and XOM to Energy. The averages are performed over
the other available 495 stocks in the S&P 500 index or
over the stocks in a given economic sector. We always
omit the self–response of the stocks in the averages.

When analyzing the inﬂuencing and inﬂuenced stocks
using the average cross–responses in Sect. V, in total 99
stocks from the S&P 500 index in 2008 are selected, as
listed in App. A. The 99 stocks include the ﬁrst ten stocks
with the largest average market capitalization in each
economic sector, except for the telecommunications ser-
vices with only nine available stocks in that year. We
recall that the average market capitalization is obtained
as the traded price multiplied with the traded volume,
averaged over every trade during the year 2008. In addi-
tion, the 99 stocks are also used to work out the 99 × 99
cross–response matrix in Sect. III C.

B. Deﬁnition of trade signs

As each stock has its own trading time, which never is
synchronous with that of another stock, it is not useful
to work out the cross–response between stocks on a trad-
ing time scale. Instead, a discrete physical time scale is

2

appropriate, taking into account the trades at the actual
time stamp. Thereby, all cross–responses are treated on
equal footing. The time stamp in our study is set to be
one second which is the minimal time scale given in the
TAQ data set. Since more than one trade or quote may
be recorded in the same second, the trade sign at one
second is an aggregated sign of all the trades in this sec-
ond. If the consecutive time intervals of one second are
labeled by t and the total number of trades in time t is
denoted by N (t), the trade sign for one second is deﬁned
as

sgn N (t)
Pn=1

0

ε(t; n)! ,

if N (t) > 0 ,

(1)

,

if N (t) = 0 .

ε(t) =


To deﬁne the sign of each trade, i.e.

Here, ε(t; n) is the trade sign of the n–th trade in the
time interval t of length one second and the function sgn
returns the sign of the argument. A non–zero value of ε(t)
indicates the number imbalance of trades in time t. To be
speciﬁc, ε(t) = +1 implies that there was a majority of
buy market orders in time t, while ε(t) = −1 indicates a
majority of sell market orders. The value ε(t) = 0 either
means that there was not any trade executed in time t or
that there was a balance of buy and sell market orders.
ε(t; n), there
are three possible approaches. The most popular one
was proposed by Lee and Ready [23]. The trade sign is
determined by comparing the traded price with the pre-
ceding midpoint price of the best buy and sell quotes.
If the traded price is larger than the preceding mid-
point price, the trade is buyer–initiated, and otherwise
seller–initiated. The Lee and Ready algorithm is able to
correctly classify at least 85% of all the trades. Unfor-
tunately, as the trades and quotes are recorded in two
separate ﬁles on time scale of one second, i.e., not distin-
guishing what happens within these one–second intervals,
it is not always possible to associate the trades with their
preceding quotes at time scales smaller than one second.
Another approach is put forward by Holthausen, Left-
wich and Mayers [24]. The trade is classiﬁed as buyer–
or seller–initiated if the traded price is diﬀerent from the
previous price. The advantage is that the trading se-
quence can be identiﬁed only using the trades ﬁle. How-
ever, as the trade is not classiﬁed when the two consecu-
tive prices are the same, this approach has a rather low
accuracy of 52.8%. Recently, we put forward a third ap-
proach [11] in which a trade with the same price as the
preceding one is also classiﬁed. Compared to the second
approach, it has a considerably higher accuracy of 85%.
This number is based on tests carried out with six sam-
ples, where in total 308857 transactions were identiﬁed.
Here, we again employ the third approach, in which the
trade sign is deﬁned as

sgn(cid:0)S(t; n) − S(t; n − 1)(cid:1) ,

if S(t; n) 6= S(t; n − 1),
otherwise,

ε(t; n − 1) ,

(2)

ε(t; n) =


where, S(t; n) denotes the price of the n–th trade in the
one–second time interval t. The traded price is the same
as the preceding one if there was suﬃcient volume at
the best quote that was not exhausted by two or more
consecutive buy or sell trades within t.

III. AVERAGE CROSS–RESPONSE

FUNCTIONS

We introduce the passive and active cross–response
functions in Sect. III A and correspondingly the passive
and active sign cross–correlators in Sect. III B. We then
discuss the inﬂuence of zero trade signs on the cross–
response of individual stocks in the ﬁnancial market in
Sect. III C.

A. Passive and active cross–response functions

The cross–response function for a stock pair (i, j) is

deﬁned as [11]

3

B. Passive and active sign cross–correlators

The trade sign cross–correlator for the stock pair (i, j)

is given by [11],

Θij(τ ) = Dεi(t + τ )εj(t)Et

.

(6)

The empirical results of the sign cross–correlation can be
ﬁtted well by a power law function,

Θij(τ ) =

ϑij

(cid:16)1 + (τ /τ (0)

ij )2(cid:17)γij /2 ,

(7)

with constants ϑij, τ (0)
and γij . We found a short–
ij
memory with exponent γij ≥ 1 for the self–correlator
as well as for the cross–correlators of trade signs on the
physical time scale [11]. However, previous studies [3, 12]
yielded a long–memory self–correlator with γ < 1 on the
trading time scale. The diﬀerence for the self–correlator
is due to the diﬀerent time scales used for the measure-
ments.
In the case of the cross–correlator, there are
strong ﬂuctuations at large time lags. They mainly result
from the trading noise for a stock pair. To reduce this
noise, we average the cross–correlator of trade signs over
diﬀerent stock pairs. Thus, corresponding to the passive
and active cross–responses, we introduce

Rij (τ ) = Dri(t, τ )εj (t)Et

,

Here, h· · · it represents the average with respect to time t.
Moreover, ri(t, τ ) denotes the logarithmic price change,
deﬁned by the midpoint price mi(t),

ri(t, τ ) = log mi(t + τ ) − log mi(t) = log

mi(t + τ )

mi(t)

.

(4)
Thus, the cross–response function for a stock pair mea-
sures how the buy or sell market orders of stock j at time t
impact the price of stock i after a time lag τ . In correlated
ﬁnancial market, the price of stock i might be impacted
by multiple stocks simultaneously. Likewise, the trades
of stock j might also impact on multiple stocks concur-
rently. As the deﬁnition Eq. (3) of the cross–response
function is not symmetric with respect to the indices, we
can perform two conceptually diﬀerent averages,

R(p)

i

(τ ) = hRij(τ )ij

and R(a)

j

(τ ) = hRij (τ )ii ,

(5)

to which we refer as passive and active cross–response
functions.
Importantly, the self–responses for (i, i) or
(j, j) are excluded in these averages. The passive cross–
response function R(p)
(τ ) measures, how the price of
stock i changes due to the trades of all other stocks,
while the active cross–response function R(a)
(τ ) quan-
tiﬁes which eﬀect the trades of stock j has on the prices
of all other stocks.

j

i

(3)

Θ(p)

i

(τ ) = hΘij(τ )ij

and Θ(a)

j

(τ ) = hΘij(τ )ii ,

(8)

as passive and active trade sign cross–correlators. We no-
tice that they are not symmetric either, because the time
lag only enters the trade sign with index i. The mem-
ory properties for these two types of average sign cross–
correlations are also checked with a power law function
of the type (7) in Sect. IV.

C.

Inﬂuence of zero trade signs

The lack of trading and the balance of buy and sell
market orders within one second leads to zero trade signs
εj(t) = 0 on the physical time scale.
In Ref. [11], we
studied the eﬀects due to in– or excluding these events.
The cross–responses including εj(t) = 0 are weaker than
the ones excluding εj(t) = 0, because the latter is purely
built up by trades, and the indirect inﬂuence of the lack of
trades is omitted. However, either including or excluding
εj(t) = 0 does not change the trend of price reversion
versus the time lag, but it does aﬀect the cross–response
strength. As a result, the market displays, at a given
time lag τ , distinct cross–response structures. To analyze
them, we deﬁned [11] the normalized cross–responses,

ρij (τ ) =

Rij(τ )

max (|Rij (τ )|)

,

(9)

where the denominator is the maximum over all stock
pairs (i, j) for ﬁxed τ . The resulting matrices in– or ex-
cluding εj(t) = 0 are shown in Fig. 1. When including

for i, j = 1, . . . , 99 at the time lag τ = 60 s in 2008. The
stocks pairs (i, j) belong to the sectors industrials (I), health
care (HC), consumer discretionary (CD), information technol-
ogy (IT), utilities (U), ﬁnancials (F), materials (M), energy
(E), consumer staples (CS), and telecommunications services
(TS).

εj(t) = 0, some stocks acting as the impacting stocks j
dominate the market, such as the stocks from informa-
tion technology (IT) sector. This yields the strip fea-
ture in the market response structure. When excluding
εj(t) = 0, we do not ﬁnd such a striking impacting stock
j. Moreover, the changes in the cross–responses across
the impacted stocks i are comparable to that across the
impacting stocks j. The distinct market cross–response
structures provide diﬀerent market information depen-
dent of whether to take into account the inﬂuence of
εj(t) = 0 or not. As this may also produce diﬀerent
average cross–responses of an individual stock across the
ﬁnancial market, we keep both cases in our study.

IV. AVERAGE CROSS–RESPONSES OF AN

INDIVIDUAL STOCK

We analyze the average cross–responses of the indi-
vidual stocks to the whole market in Sect. IV A and to
diﬀerent economic sectors in Sect. IV B.

A. Average cross–responses to the market

We carry out the empirical analysis for the stocks
AAPL, GS, XOM by averaging their cross–response func-
tions over other 495 stocks in the S&P500 index. The
results for passive and active cross–response functions as
well as the corresponding passive and active trade sign
cross–correlators are presented in Fig. 2. We distinguish
the results for in– or excluding εj(t) = 0. We checked
that these empirical results are similar to those from av-
eraging over the in each case remaining 98 stocks listed
in App. A. To facilitate the computation, we only cal-
culate the average cross–response values at several time
lags, which are marked in Fig. 2, rather than at every
second.

The passive and active cross–response functions clearly

4

show diﬀerent behaviors. The passive cross–response re-
verses faster than the active one. It only persists dozens
of seconds and then reverses to drop down quickly with
sizeable volatility. In contrast, the active cross–response
reverses at time lags of some hundreds of seconds and
the price changes slowly. An obvious reason for this dif-
ference is the easier detectability of price changes in one
stock than of those dispersed over diﬀerent stocks. Again,
with our results, we can extend the previous interpreta-
tions based on the study of single stocks. The passive
cross–response function reﬂects the price dynamics on
short time scales. When the price goes up, less market or-
ders to buy will be emitted and more limit orders to sell.
Thus, the price reverses [25] without a need to evoke new
information as a cause. Moreover, liquidity induced mean
reversion attracts more buyers, which motivates liquidity
providers to raise the price again, while the volatilities in
this process of responding decline. Thus, we conclude for
the market as a whole that the mean reversion accentu-
ates the short–period price volatility, which is consistent
with the single–stock analysis [26, 27]. The active cross–
response reﬂects the dispersion of the trade impacts over
the prices of diﬀerent stocks. It is conceivable that this
process takes longer compared to the time scales of the
passive cross–response. Furthermore, this dispersion is
accompanied by spreading out the volatilities.

As visible in Fig. 2, for the average cross–responses in-
cluding εj(t) = 0, the active ones are all stronger than
the passive ones at their maximum values. The reason
for the diﬀerent strengths of passive and active cross–
responses is the existence of strongly inﬂuencing stocks.
On the left hand side of Fig. 1, we observe that the ver-
tical stripes are much more pronounced than the hori-
zontal ones. More speciﬁcally, there are groups of stocks
which have a strong inﬂuence across most of the mar-
ket, in particular, this is evident for the stocks in the IT
sector. Consequently, the active cross–response of these
stocks averaged over the market shows a strong signal. As
for the passive cross–response, however, fewer inﬂuenced
stocks contribute, which leads to a reduced value of the
average. However, the strength diﬀerence is not so appar-
ent for the average cross–responses excluding εj(t) = 0.
The right hand side of Fig. 1 shows that the inﬂuencing
and inﬂuenced stocks contribute to the average cross–
responses with similar strength.

To analyze the average trade sign cross–correlators de-
picted in Fig. 2, we use the power law (7) to ﬁt the empir-
ical results. The ﬁtting parameters and errors are shown
in Table I. The remarkable result is that the volatile short
memory of the individual cross–correlators [11] turns into
a long memory with exponents smaller than one after
averaging. The only exception is the passive trade sign
cross–correlator for the stock XOM. We thus infer that
the price changes caused by trade sign cross–correlations
in diﬀerent stocks can accumulate to persist over longer
time. Another interesting aspect is the decay period τ (0)
or τ (0)
of the sign cross–correlators. For stock pairs, the
decay period excluding εj(t) = 0 is longer than the one

including εj(t) = 0 [11]. This might be attributed to
the inﬂuence of the lack of trading or to the balance of
buy and sell market orders, which both accelerate the
decay of sign cross–correlations. By averaging the cross–
response across diﬀerent stocks, however, the two decay
periods are eﬀectively enhanced and become compara-
ble. This is so because the noise is reduced by averaging,
slowing down the decay and yielding long–memory sign

cross–correlations.

B. Average cross–responses to economic sectors

Another observation which can be made in Fig. 1 is
that the cross–responses vary for diﬀerent economic sec-
tors.

may produce diﬀerent average cross–responses to a given
stock. We calculate the average cross–responses of the
stocks AAPL, GS and XOM to ten economic sectors
in the S&P 500 index. The passive and active cross–
responses are displayed in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.
Both of the average cross–responses show a strong de-
pendence on the economic sectors. Here, we also consider
the cross–responses in– and and excluding εj(t) = 0, and
we notice a remarkable diﬀerence for the passive cross–
responses. The three stocks considered have in common
that their prices are all aﬀected by the trades within their
own sectors, especially XOM, which is not surprising due

to the same economic eﬀects.

The active cross–responses, for εj(t) = 0 in– and ex-
cluded, show time–dependent clustering across diﬀerent
sectors. This will be further discussed in Sect. V C. The
trades of AAPL and GS have a signiﬁcant impact on the
prices of the stocks from ﬁnancials (F), but a lesser one
on utilities (U), health care (HC), and consumer staples
(CS). This might be due to the stability of these sectors
which serve the needs of daily life. The trades of XOM
are more likely to inﬂuence energy (E), but have a lesser
eﬀect on health care (HC) and consumer staples (CS).
This is so because utilities (U) are economically more

INFLUENCING AND INFLUENCED STOCK
FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF AVERAGE

CROSS–RESPONSES

We identify the inﬂuencing and inﬂuenced stocks re-
spectively employing active and passive cross–responses
in Sect. V A. We discuss the relations between inﬂu-
encing stocks and trading frequency in Sect. V B, and
we analyze the relation of average cross–responses to the
trading frequency in Sect. V C.

A.

Identifying the inﬂuencing and inﬂuenced stocks

As the passive and active cross–response functions
measure the strength with which one stock impacts or
is impacted by other stocks, respectively, we can clas-
sify the stocks as the inﬂuencing and inﬂuenced stocks.
The inﬂuenced stocks with strong passive cross–responses
are easily impacted by the trades of other stocks. On
the other hand, the inﬂuencing stocks with strong ac-
tive cross–responses have large impacts on the prices of
other stocks. Again, the impact here is separated into
the impacts in– or excluding zero trade signs.

To identify the strongly inﬂuencing and inﬂuenced sto-
cks, we rank the 99 stocks listed in App. A according to
the numerical values of passive and active cross–response
functions, normalized according to Eq. (9), at a given

time lag τ . The ﬁrst ﬁfteen stocks with strongest average
cross–responses at τ = 1, 2, 60, 300 s are shown in Fig. 5
including εj(t) = 0 and in Fig. 6 excluding εj(t) = 0. As
seen, for the passive cross–response either in– or exclud-
ing εj(t) = 0, the rank of strongly inﬂuenced stocks is not
changed too much, especially for FTR, X, CF, NUE and
S. This is so, because the inﬂuence of zero trade signs
is reduced across diﬀerent stocks, altering the ranks of
inﬂuenced stocks only little. However, the inﬂuence is
spread to diﬀerent stocks simply due to trading. Thus
great diﬀerence of the ranks for the inﬂuencing stocks
can be found in the active cross–responses in– and ex-
cluding εj(t) = 0. As for the former, most of the in-
ﬂuencing stocks come from the information technology
(IT) sector. Their ranks look similar at diﬀerent time
lags. This matches the relatively stable cross–response
structure visible in Fig. 1. As for the latter, more stocks
from ﬁnancials (F) are in the top positions. Even some
stocks from utilities, which are not in the top ranks in
the former case, are identiﬁed as the inﬂuencing stocks.

analysis.

In Fig. 7, two diﬀerent scenarios are visible. For
εj(t) = 0 included, there is a linear relation with a high
correlation between the active cross–response and the
average daily number of trades. Thus, the inﬂuencing
stocks are also the stocks with high trading frequency.
The impacts of trades from the frequently traded stocks
rapidly follow each other. Before the previous impact
vanishes, the new one appears and pushes the price per-
sistently. The cross–responses of the infrequently traded
stocks are weaker, because it happens that the previous
impact has vanished, but the next impact has not arrived
yet. As a result, the prices of other stocks are aﬀected
more by other information, e.g. news, rather than by the
impact of trades. On the other hand, when εj(t) = 0 is
excluded, the linear relation disappears. The high trad-
ing frequency does not longer indicate the high inﬂuence
of individual stocks. The strongly inﬂuencing stocks are
more likely to be found in the stocks with an average
daily number of trades smaller than 2000.

B. Relations between inﬂuencing stocks and

C. Relations of average cross–responses in– and

trading frequency

excluding zero trade signs

The zero trade signs relate to the trading frequency of
the stocks on the time scale of one second. The fewer zero
trade signs, the higher is the trading frequency. Hence,
the ranks of inﬂuencing and inﬂuenced stocks are con-
nected to the trading frequency of those stocks. Because
of the great diﬀerence in the ranks for inﬂuencing stocks
when comparing the in– and exclusion of zero trade signs,
we check the relation between the active cross–responses
of individual stocks and their average daily number of
trades. The number of daily trades is at most one per
second from 9:40 to 15:50 New York local time. It is the
sum of the absolute values of the trade signs deﬁned in
Eq. (1). The 99 stocks listed in App. A are used for the

As we know, the asynchronous trading induces spuri-
ous lead–lag correlations, and the returns of frequently
traded stocks generally lead those of infrequently traded
stocks [28, 29]. For example, incoming news inﬂuences
the frequently traded stocks ﬁrst, and then, after a time
lag, the infrequently traded stocks. In our study, the high
correlation between the active cross–response including
εj(t) = 0 and the average daily number of trades might
be misinterpreted such that the inﬂuence that the stocks
exert be due to the lead–lag correlation of the return
rather than due to the impact of trades. When including
the zero trade signs, we take into account how the lack
of trading or the balance of buy and sell market orders

aﬀects the impact of trades. Suppose there is a buy mar-
ket order of stock j executed at time t. Now, news comes
in that triggers sell orders of stock i between the time t
and t + τ . To which degree is the price impact of stock
i from the trades of stock j weakened due to the news
from time t to t + τ ?

To answer this question, we recall the deﬁnition of the

cross–response functions in– and excluding εj(t) = 0,

(11)

For stock j, Tj and Tj;n are the total trading times of
stock j and the total time of lack of trading or of a buy–
sell balance, respectively. If trading does not take place
or if there is a buy–sell balance, the products ri(t, τ )εj (t)
vanish. Thus, the numerators in Eqs. (10) and (11) are
the same, while the denominators, i.e, the normalization
constants, diﬀer. Hence, we ﬁnd

R(inc. 0)

ij

(τ ) = fjR(exc. 0)

ij

(τ ) ,

where we deﬁned the relative trading frequency

fj =

Tj

Tj + Tj;n

.

(12)

(13)

In parts of the literature, the term frequency is used in a
colloquial sense, for example: a frequently traded stock
is a very often traded stock. The deﬁnition (13) is con-
sistent with that, but quantiﬁes it. The most frequently
traded stocks have fj = 1, because the time Tj;n is zero.
The longer this time, the lower is the relative trading
frequency. Put diﬀerently, fj can be regarded as the
probability for trades to occur on the time scale of one
second. Coming back to the above question, fj rescales
the degree of impact: the higher the trading frequency
fj, the stronger is the impact of trades on the price after
a time lag. According to Eq. (12), the cross–response
including εj(t) = 0 is the one excluding εj(t) = 0 scaled
by a proper probability. Obviously, the cross–response
including εj(t) = 0 can never be stronger than the one
excluding εj(t) = 0.

We now turn to the average cross–responses. Passive
and active cross–responses behave rather diﬀerently. For
the passive cross–response including εj(t) = 0, we have

where k is the total number of stocks j. The cross–
responses excluding εj(t) = 0 weighted with the factors

fj have to be summed over diﬀerent stocks j to yield the
passive cross–response including εj(t) = 0. Remarkably,
the diﬀerence of the stock ranks based on the passive
cross–responses in– and excluding εj(t) = 0 is reduced
by this average. On the other hand, for the active cross–
response, we ﬁnd

(15)

because the factor fj is independent of the average of
the cross–response excluding εj(t) = 0. The active cross–
response including εj(t) = 0 is simply proportional to the
one excluding εj(t) = 0. This explains that the active
cross–response including εj(t) = 0 exhibits a high corre-
lation with the average daily number of trades while the
one excluding εj(t) = 0 does not.

VI. COMPARISONS OF SELF– AND

CROSS–RESPONSES

We compared the self– and cross–responses in a pre-
vious study [11],
focussing on the diﬀerence of self–
responses on diﬀerent time scales and on the diﬀerence
of the self– and cross–responses on the same time scale.
Here, we discuss the average cross–responses, and further
clarify what happens on the physical time scale. The
cross–responses as well as the sign cross–correlators for
the stocks of AAPL, GS and XOM are displayed in Figs. 8
and 9. The zero trade signs are included in the analy-
sis, i.e., the inﬂuence of trading frequency is taking into
account.

Figure 8 shows the comparisons of the self– and cross–
responses as well as the average cross–responses, i.e.,
passive and active cross–responses. Typically, the self–
response is stronger than the cross–response for two
stocks due to the strong self–correlation of trade signs.
The example of XOM, however, shows that the cross–
response can be stronger than the self–response. The
average cross–responses are always weaker than the self–
response, implying that cases such as XOM are rare. Due
to the noise reduction we can follow the average cross–
responses over a longer time interval. On shorter scales
of the time lag τ , both, self– and cross–responses, should
be considered when looking at individual stocks, but for
investigating cross–response stability, persistence or eﬃ-
ciency of the market as a whole, the average quantities
give useful information on longer scales.

In Fig. 9 the trade sign self– and cross–correlators cor-
responding to Fig. 8 are depicted. The diﬀerences be-
tween these correlators are observable for time lags of
less than 10 seconds. With the lag increasing, the self–
correlators are close to the cross–correlators for AAPL

and GS. The exceptional behavior of XOM, however,
shows up again in the sign correlators.
In the study
of the self–response [3], a ‘bare’ impact function with
a power–law decay for a single trade was proposed to ac-
count for the ampliﬁcation eﬀect of sign self–correlations.
It derives from the self–correlation accumulation with
the time lag increasing. Thus, the impact function and
the sign self–correlation, mutually describe the price self–
response. For XOM, the sign self–correlator is larger than
the cross–correlators before the appearance of correla-
tion ﬂuctuations, but its cross–response is stronger than
the self–response. This implies that the impact functions
of the self– and cross–responses are diﬀerent.
In other
words, there are diﬀerent impact mechanisms between
the self–and cross–responses.

The averages that we perform produce the com-
bined impacts of diﬀerent stocks on individual stocks.
The bare impact functions cannot be observed directly.
Here, we observe the decay of the average sign cross–
correlators. The passive and active cross–correlators are
always smaller than the self–correlators for AAPL, GS
and XOM before the appearance of correlation ﬂuctu-
ations, which is consistent with the case of the cross–
responses. Thus, the combined impact function of the
individual stocks is more stable than the ones for each
stock pair.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We introduced average cross–response functions, a pas-
sive and an active one, measuring the average price
change of a given stock due to the trades of all others
as well as the impact of trading a speciﬁc stock on the
average price change of the other ones, respectively. In-
terestingly, the passive cross–response reverses at a rela-
tively short time lag of dozens of seconds or so and then
declines rather quickly in a volatile way, while the active
cross–response reverses at a longer time lag of some hun-
dreds of seconds with less volatility. This is so, because
the price change in one stock easily alerts the market
participants. The dispersion over diﬀerent stocks makes
it more diﬃcult to detect an eﬀect due to the noise inter-
ference. The average cross–responses considerably reduce
this noise, and make generic eﬀects visible. We also in-
troduced the corresponding active and passive trade sign
cross–correlators. It is quite remarkable that the short
memory for a stock pair turns into a long memory when
averaged over diﬀerent stock pairs.

We compared the cross–responses in– and excluding
the zero trade signs. The cross–response including the

11

zero trade signs reﬂects the weakened impact of trades
due to a lack of trading or due to the balance of buy
and sell market orders in one second. We showed that
it is the cross–response excluding the zero trade signs,
i.e. the price impact purely caused by trades, scaled by a
trading frequency on the time scale of one second. Which
stocks are identiﬁed as inﬂuencing by studying the active
cross–responses diﬀers for in– and excluding zero trade
signs. There is a high correlation with the average daily
number of trades when including zero trade signs, but
low correlation when excluding zero trade signs.

We also compared the self–response with the various
cross–responses. On shorter scales of the time lag, it is
useful to consider the self– and the cross–responses for
individual stocks. However, on longer scales, the aver-
age cross–responses give interesting new information for
investigating the stability, persistence or the eﬃciency
of the market as a whole. Moreover, the comparison of
sign self– and cross–correlators reveals the existence of
diﬀerent impact mechanisms.
