On the Kantorovich’s theorem for Newton’s Method for solving

generalized equations under the majorant condition

Gilson N. Silva ∗

March 14, 2016

Abstract

In this paper we consider a version of the Kantorovich’s theorem for solving the generalized
equation F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0, where F is a Fr´echet derivative function and T is a set-valued and
maximal monotone acting between Hilbert spaces. We show that this method is quadratically
convergent to a solution of F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0. We have used the ideia of majorant function, which
relaxes the Lipschitz continuity of the derivative F ′. It allows us to obtain the optimal con-
vergence radius, uniqueness of solution and also to solving generalized equations under Smale’s
condition.

Keywords: Generalized Equation, Kantorovich’s theorem, Newton’s Method, Hilbert Spaces, Ma-

1 Introduction

In this paper we are interested in the solution of the generalized equation

F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0,

(1)

where F : Ω → H is a Fr´echet diﬀerentiable function, H is a Hibert space, Ω ⊆ H an open set
and T : H ⇒ H is set-valued and maximal monotone. As is well known, the generalized equation
(1) covers wide range of problems in classical analysis and its applications. For instance, systems
of nonlinear equations and abstract inequality systems. If ψ : H → (−∞, +∞] is a proper lower
semicontinuous convex function and

T (x) = ∂ψ(x) = {u ∈ H : ψ(y) ≥ ψ(x) + hu, y − xi},

∀ y ∈ H,

then (1) becomes the variational inequality problem

F (x) + ∂ψ(x) ∋ 0,

including linear and nonlinear complementary problems; additional comments about such problems
can be found in [5, 10, 12, 17, 24, 25], and the references cited therein.

Newton’s method is one of the most important methods to solve (1) which generates a sequence,

for an initial point x0, as follows

F (xk) + F ′(xk)(xk+1 − xk) + T (xk+1) ∋ 0,

k = 0, 1, . . . .

(2)

This method may be viewed as a Newton-type method based on a partial linearization, which
has been studied in several papers including [4, 14]; see also [5, Section 6C] where a interesting
discussion about iterative methods for solving generalized equations is presented. When F ≡ 0, the
iteration (2) becomes the standard Newton’s method for solving the nonlinear equation F (x) = 0.
L.V. Kantorovich in [13], established a convergence result to a solution of the Newton method
for solving the equation F (x) = 0 using conditions where the iterations begin. To be more speciﬁc,
by imposing assumptions on the derivative F ′(x0) and of the term kF ′(x0)−1F (x0)k he obtained a
convergence result to a solution of the Newton method. The main idea of Kantorovich, used in his
proof, was the majorization principle of the sequence xk by a sequence of scalars. Recently, there
has been some growing interest in Kantorovich’s theorem, see for instance [6, 10, 11, 15, 27].

Up to our knowledge, Robinson in [17], was the ﬁrst to consider a generalization of the Kan-
torovich theorem of the type F (x) ∈ K, where K is a nonempty closed and convex cone, giving
convergence results and error bounds for this method. His idea was to use properties of convex pro-
cess introduced by Rockafellar [21], for more details and results about convex process see [18, 20].
In [17] the iterative xk+1 is taken as the element of the set of points xk+1 deﬁned by (2) which is
at minimal distance from xk. Thus is obtained that the sequence xk converges quadratically to a
solution of F (x) ∈ K.
N. H. Josephy in [12] was the ﬁrst to consider a semi local Newton’s method of the kind (2), in
order to solving (1), to F = NC the normal cone mapping of a convex set C ⊂ Rm. For guarantee
the well deﬁnition of the method, in the theory of generalized equations, the property of strong
regularity of F (x0) + F ′(x0)(x − x0) + T (x) at x1 for 0, where x1 is obtained from x0, introduced
by S.M. Robinson in [19], was used. If X = Y and F = {0}, then strong regularity of f (x0) +
f ′(x0)(x− x0) + F (x) at x1 ∈ X for 0 ∈ X is equivalent to assumption that f ′(x0)−1 is a continuous
− × {0}m−s, then strong regularity is equivalent to
linear operator. If X = Rn, Y = Rm and F = Rs
Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualiﬁcation; see [5, Example 4D.3]. An important case is when
(1) represents the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker’s systems for the standard nonlinear programming problem
with a strict local minimizer, see [5] pag. 232.

In [2, 25] under a majorant condition and generalized Lipschitz condition, local and semi local
convergence, quadratic rate and estimate of the best possible convergence radius of Newtons method
as well as uniqueness of the solution for solving generalized equation were established. One usual
assumption used to obtain quadratic convergence of Newton’s method (2), for solving equation (1),
is the Lipschitz continuity of F ′ in a neighborhood the solution; see [5]. Indeed, keeping control of
the derivative is an important point in the convergence analysis of Newton’s method. On the other
hand, a couple of papers have dealt with the issue of convergence analysis of the Newton’s method,
for solving the equation F (x) = 0, by relaxing the assumption of Lipschitz continuity of F ′, see for
example [11, 27, 28], actually all this conditions are equivalent to X. Wang’s condition introduced
in [27]. The advantage of working with a majorant condition rests in the fact that it allow to unify
several convergence results pertaining to Newton’s method; see [11, 27]; see Section 4.

In this paper we rephrase the majorant condition introduced in [11], in order to study the local
convergence properties of Newton’s method (2). The analysis presented provides a clear relationship
between the majorant function and the function deﬁning the generalized equation. Also, it allows
us to obtain the optimal convergence radius for the method with respect to the majorant condition
and uniqueness of solution. The analysis of this method, under Lipschitz’s condition and Smale’s
condition, are provided as special case.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, some notations and important results
used throughout the paper are presented. In Section 3, the main result is stated and in Section 3.1
properties of the majorant function, the main relationships between the majorant function and the
nonlinear operator are established. In Section 3.2 the main result is proved, the uniqueness of the
solution and some applications of this result are given in Section 4. Some ﬁnal remarks are made
in Section 5.

2 Preliminaries

The following notations and results are used throughout our presentation. Let H be a Hilbert space
with scalar product h., .i and norm k.k, the open and closed balls at x with radius δ ≥ 0 are denoted,
respectively, by B(x, δ) := {y ∈ X : kx − yk < δ} and B[x, δ] := {y ∈ X : kx − yk 6 δ}.
We denote by L (X, Y ) the space consisting of all continuous linear mappings A : X → Y and
the operator norm of A is deﬁned by kAk := sup {kAxk : kxk 6 1}. Recall that a bounded linear
operator G : H → H is called a positive operator if G is a self-conjugate and hGx, xi ≤ 0 for each
x ∈ H. The domain and the range of H are, respectively, the sets dom H := {x ∈ X : H(x) 6= ∅}
and rge H := {y ∈ Y : y ∈ H(x) for some x ∈ X}. The inverse of H is the set-valued mapping
H −1 : Y ⇒ X deﬁned by H −1(y) := {x ∈ X : y ∈ H(x)}.
Deﬁnition 1. Let H, be a Hilbert space, Ω be an open nonempty subset of H, h : Ω → H be
a Fr´echet derivative with derivative h′ and T : H ⇒ H be a set-valued mapping. The partial
linearization of the mapping h + T at x ∈ H is the set-valued mapping Lh(x,·) : H ⇒ H given by
(3)

Lh(x, y) := h(x) + h′(x)(y − x) + T (y).

For each x ∈ H, the inverse Lh(x,·)−1 : H ⇒ H of the mapping Lh(x,·) at z ∈ H is denoted by

Remark 1. If in above deﬁnition we have T ≡ 0, z = 0 and h′(x) invertible, then Lh(x, 0)−1 =
x − h′(x)−1h(x) is the Newton iteration for solving the equation h(x) = 0.

Now, we recall notions of monotonicity for set-valued operators.

Deﬁnition 2. Let T : H ⇒ H be a set-valued operator. T is said to be monotone if for any
x, y ∈ dom T and, u ∈ T (y), v ∈ T (x) implies that the follwing inequality holds:

hu − v, y − xi ≥ 0.

A subset of H × H is monotone if it is the graph of a monotone operator. If ϕ : H → (−∞, +∞]

is a proper function then the subgradient of ϕ is monotone.

Deﬁnition 3. Let T : H ⇒ H be monotone. Then T is maximal monotone if the following
implication holds for all x, u ∈ H:

hu − v, y − xi ≥ 0
An example of maximal monotone operator is the subgradient of a proper, lower semicontinuous,

v ∈ T (y) ⇒ x ∈ domT and v ∈ T (x).

(5)

for each

y ∈ domT and

convex function ϕ : H → (−∞, +∞]. The following result can de found in [26].
Lemma 1. Let G be a positive operator. The following statements about G hold:

3

Lh(x, z)−1 :=(cid:8)y ∈ X : z ∈ h(x) + h′(x)(y − x) + T (y)(cid:9) .

(4)

1. kG2k = kGk2;
2. If G−1 exists, then G−1 is a positive operator.

As a consequence of this result we have the following result:

Lemma 2. Let G be a positive operator. Suppose that G−1 exists, then for each x ∈ H we have

hGx, xi ≥ kxk2
kG−1k

.

Proof. See Lemma 2.2 of [24].

Let G : H → H be a bounded linear opeartor. We will use the convention that bG := 1
where G∗ is the conjugate operator of G. As we can see, bG is a self-conjugate operator. From
now, we assume that T : H ⇒ H is a set-valued maximal monotone operator and F : H → H is a
Fr´echet derivative function. The next result is of major importance to prove the good deﬁnition of
Newton’s method. Its proof can be found in [22, Lemma 1, p.189].

2 (G + G∗)

Lemma 3 (Banach’s lemma). Let B : H → H be a bounded linear operator and I : H → H the
identity operator. If kB − Ik < 1 then B is invertible and kB−1k ≤ 1/(1 − kB − Ik).

3 Local analysis of Newton’s method

In this section, we study the Newton’s method for solving the generalized equation (1), which is
based in the partial linearization of this equation, see [12] (see also, [4]). For study the convergence
properties of this method, we assume that the derivative F ′ satisﬁes a weak Lipschitz condition on
a region Ω relaxing the usual Lipschitz condition. The statement of the our main result is:

Theorem 4. Let H be a Hilbert space, Ω be an open nonempty subset of H, F : Ω → H be
continuous with Fr´echet derivative F ′ continuous, T : H ⇒ H be a set-valued operator and x0 ∈ Ω.
Suppose that F ′(x0) is a positive operator and \F ′(x0)
exists. Let R > 0 and κ := sup{t ∈ [0, R) :
B(x0, t) ⊂ Ω}. Suppose that there exist f : [0, R) → R twice continuously diﬀerentiable such that
(6)

k(cid:13)(cid:13)F ′(y) − F ′(x)(cid:13)(cid:13) ≤ f ′ (kx − yk + kx − x0k) − f ′ (kx − x0k) ,

−1

−1

k \F ′(x0)

for all x, y ∈ B(x0, κ). Moreover, suppose that

kx1 − x0k ≤ f (0),

(7)

and the following conditions hold,

h1) f (0) > 0 and f ′(0) = −1;
h2) f ′ is convex and strictly increasing.

h3) f (t) = 0 for some t ∈ (0, R).
Then, f has a smallest zero t∗ ∈ (0, R), the sequences generated by Newton’s method for solving the
generalized equation F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 and the equation f (t) = 0, with starting point x0 and t0 = 0,
respectively,

0 ∈ F (xk) + F ′(xk)(xk+1 − xk) + T (xk+1),

tk+1 = tk − f (tk)/f ′(tk),

k = 0, 1, . . . ,

are well deﬁned, {tk} is strictly increasing, is contained in (0, t∗) and converges to t∗, {xk} is
contained in B(x0, t∗) and converges to the point x∗ ∈ B[x0, t∗] which is the unique solution of the
generalized equation F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 in B[x0, t∗]. Moreover, the sequences {xk} and {tk} satisﬁes,
(9)

t∗ − tk+1
(t∗ − tk)2kx∗ − xkk2,
for all k=0,1,..., and the sequences {tk} and {xk} converge Q-linearly as follows

kx∗ − xkk ≤ t∗ − tk,

kx∗ − xk+1k ≤

kx∗ − xk+1k ≤

1
2kx∗ − xkk,

t∗ − tk+1 ≤

(t∗ − tk)

k = 0, 1, . . .

.

(10)

If, additionally

h4) f ′(t∗) < 0,

then the sequences, {tk} and {xk} converge Q-quadratically as follows

kx∗ − xk+1k ≤

D−f ′(t∗)

−2f ′(t∗) kx∗ − xkk2,

t∗ − tk+1 ≤

D−f ′(t∗)
−2f ′(t∗)

(t∗ − tk)2,

(11)

for all k = 0, 1, . . .

.

Remark 2. When F ≡ 0 and f ′ satises a Lipschitz-type condition, we will obtain a particular
instance of Theorem 4, which retrieves the classical convergence theorem on Newtons method under
the Lipschitz condition; see [16, 23].

Remark 3. Since T is monotone maximal, if there exists a constant c > 0 such that

hF ′(xk)y, yi ≥ ckyk2

(12)

for each y ∈ H, then there exist an unique point xk+1 such that the ﬁrst inclusion in (8) holds. The
proof of this result can be found in [24, Lemma 2.2]. Hence, if for each k, there exist a constant
c > 0 such that (12) holds, then the sequence generated by (8) is well deﬁned.

From now on, we assume that the hypotheses of Theorem 4 hold.

3.1 Basics results

In this section we will establish some results about the majorant function f : [0, R) → R and,
some relationships between the majorant function and the set-valued mapping F + T. For this, we
begin by reminding that Proposition 3 of [11] state that the majorant function f has a smallest
root t∗ ∈ (0, R), is strictly convex, f (t) > 0, f ′(t) < 0 and t < t − f (t)/f ′(t) < t∗ for all t ∈ [0, t∗).
Moreover, f ′(t∗) 6 0 and f ′(t∗) < 0 if, and only if, there exists t ∈ (t∗, R) such that f (t) < 0. Let

¯t := sup(cid:8)t ∈ [0, R) : f ′(t) < 0(cid:9) .

Note that t∗ ≤ ¯t. Since f ′(t) < 0 for all t ∈ [0, ¯t), the Newton iteration of the majorant function f
is well deﬁned in [0, ¯t). Let us call it nf : [0, ¯t) → R such that

nf (t) = t −

f (t)
f ′(t)

.

(13)

The next result will be used to obtain the convergence rate of the sequence generated by Newton’s
method for solving f (t) = 0. Its proof can be found in [11, Proposition 4].

5

Lemma 5. For all t ∈ [0, t∗) we have nf (t) ∈ [0, t∗), t < nf (t) and t∗ − nf (t) ≤ 1
satisﬁes the condition h4 then

2 (t∗ − t). If f also

t∗ − nf (t) ≤

D−f ′(t∗)
−2f ′(t∗)

(t∗ − t)2,

∀ t ∈ [0, t∗).

The deﬁnition on {tk} on (8) is equivalent to the following one

t0 = 0,

tk+1 = nf (tk),

k = 0, 1 . . . .

(14)

The next result contain the main convergence properties of the above sequence and its prove, which
is a consequence of Lemma 5, follows the same pattern as the proof of Corollary 2.15 of [9].
Corollary 6. The sequence {tk} is well deﬁned, strictly increasing and is contained in [0, t∗). More-
over, it satisﬁes second inequality in (10) and converges Q-linearly to t∗. If also satisﬁes assumption
h4 then {tk} satisﬁes the second inequality in (11) and converges Q-quadratically.

Therefore, we have obtained all the statements about the majorant sequence {tk} on Theorem 4.
Now we are going to establish some relationships between the majorant function and the set-valued
mapping F + T. In the sequel we will prove that the partial linearization of F + T has a single-
valued inverse, which is Lipschitz in a neighborhood of x0. Since Newton’s iteration at a point in
this neighborhood happens to be a zero of the partial linearization of F + T at such a point, it will
be ﬁrst convenient to study the linearization error of F at a point in Ω

In the next result we bound this error by the linearization error of the majorant function f , namely,

EF (x, y) := F (y) −(cid:2)F (x) + F ′(x)(y − x)(cid:3) ,
ef (t, u) := f (u) −(cid:2)f (t) + f ′(t)(u − t)(cid:3) ,

t, u ∈ [0, R).

y, x ∈ Ω.

(15)

Lemma 7. Take x, y ∈ B(x0, R) and 0 ≤ t < v < R. If kx − x0k ≤ t and ky − xk ≤ v − t then

−1

k \F ′(x0)

kkEF (x, y)k ≤ ef (t, v)ky − xk2
(v − t)2 .

(16)

Proof. Since x + τ (y − x) ∈ B(x0, R), for all τ ∈ [0, 1] and F is continuously diﬀerentiable in Ω, the
linearization error of F on (15) is equivalent to

EF (x, y) =Z 1

0

[F ′(x + τ (y − x)) − F ′(x)](y − x)dτ,

which combined with the assumption in (6) and after some simple algebraic manipulations we obtain

−1

k \F ′(x0)

kkEF (x, y)k ≤Z 1

0

[f ′(kx − x0k + τky − xk) − f ′(kx − x0k)]ky − xkdτ.

Now, using the convexity of f ′, the assumptions kx − x0k ≤ t and ky − xk < v − t, v < R we have

f ′(kx − x0k + τky − xk) − f ′(kx − x0k) ≤ f ′(t + τky − xk) − f ′(t)

≤ [f ′(t + τkv − tk) − f ′(t)]ky − xk
v − t

,

for any τ ∈ [0, 1]. Combining these inequalities we conclude that

−1

k \F ′(x0)

kkEF (x, y)k ≤Z 1

0

[f ′(t + τkv − tk) − f ′(t)]ky − xk2
v − t

dτ,

which, after performing the integration we obtain the desired result.

6

In the next result we will present the main relationships between the majorant function f and

the operator F . The result is a consequence of Banach’s lemma and its statement is:

Lemma 8. Let x0 ∈ Ω be such that \F ′(x0) is a positive operator and \F ′(x0)
t < t∗, then \F ′(x) is a positive operator and \F ′(x)

exists. Moreover,

−1

−1

exists. If kx− x0k ≤

−1

k\F ′(x)

Proof. Firstly note that

−1

k ≤ −k \F ′(x0)

f ′(t)

k\F ′(x) − \F ′(x0)k ≤

2kF ′(x) − F ′(x0)k +

1
2k(F ′(x) − F ′(x0))∗k = kF ′(x) − F ′(x0)k.

(17)

Take x ∈ B[x0, t], 0 ≤ t < t∗. Thus f ′(t) < 0. Using (17), (6) and taking into account h1 and h2
we obtain that

−1

kk\F ′(x) − \F ′(x0)k ≤ k \F ′(x0)

k \F ′(x0)
Thus, by Banach’s lemma, we conclude that \F ′(x)

−1

kkF ′(x) − F ′(x0)k ≤ f ′(kx − x0k) − f ′(0) < f ′(t) + 1 < 1.
(18)

−1

exists. Moreover by above inequality,

k

On the other hand, using (18) we have

k\F ′(x) − \F ′(x0)k ≤

1

k \F ′(x0)

−1

.

k

Take y ∈ H. Then, it follows by above inequality that

h( \F ′(x0) − \F ′(x))y, yi ≤ k \F ′(x0) − \F ′(x)kkyk2 ≤

kyk2
k \F ′(x0)

k

which implies, after of simple manipulations that

h \F ′(x0)y, yi −

kyk2
k \F ′(x0)

−1

k

≤ h\F ′(x)y, yi.

Since \F ′(x0) is a positive operator and \F ′(x0)

−1

exists by assumption, we obtain by Lemma 2 that

h \F ′(x0)y, yi ≥

kyk2
k \F ′(x0)

−1

.

k

Therefore, combining the two last inequalities we conclude that h\F ′(x)y, yi ≥ 0, i.e, \F ′(x) is a

positive operator.

7

Lemma 8 shows that \F ′(x) is a positive operator and \F ′(x)

−1

exists, thus by Lemma 2 we have

that for any y ∈ H

h\F ′(x)y, yi ≥

kyk2
k\F ′(x)

−1

.

k

Note that h\F ′(x)y, yi = hF ′(x)y, yi, thus by the second part of Lemma 8 and h2 we conclude that
F ′(x) satisﬁes (12) and consequently, the Newton iteration mapping is well-deﬁned. Let us call
NF +T , the Newton iteration mapping for F + T in that region, namely, NF +T : B(x0, t∗) → H is
deﬁned by
(20)

NF +T (x) := LF (x, 0)−1.

Using (4) we conclude that the denition of the Newton iteration mapping in (20) is equivalent to

0 ∈ LF (x, NF +T (x)) := F (x) + F ′(x)(NF +T (x) − x) + T (NF +T (x)),

∀ x ∈ B(x0, t∗).

(21)

Remark 4. Since 0 ∈ F (x0) + F ′(x0)(x1 − x0) + T (x1), x1 ∈ Ω, is single-valued, it follow from (4)
that

{x1} = LF (x0, 0)−1.

Therefore, one can apply a single Newton iteration on any x ∈ B(x0, t∗) to obtain NF +T (x)
which may not belong to B(x0, t∗), or even may not belong to the domain of F . Thus, this is
enough to guarantee the well-deﬁniteness of only one iteration of Newton’s method. To ensure that
Newtonian iterations may be repeated indeﬁnitely or in particular, invariant on subsets of B(x0, t∗),
we need some additional results. First, deﬁne some subsets of B(x0, t∗) in which, as we shall prove,
Newton iteration mapping (21) are “well behaved”. Deﬁne

K(t) :=(cid:26)x ∈ Ω : kx − x0k ≤ t,

kLF (x, 0)−1 − xk ≤ −

f (t)

f ′(t)(cid:27) ,

t ∈ [0, t∗),

K := [t∈[0,t∗)

K(t).

(22)

(23)

Lemma 9. For each 0 ≤ t < t∗ we have K(t) ⊂ B(x0, t∗) and NF +T (K(t)) ⊂ K(nf (t)). As a
consequence, K ⊆ B(x0, t∗) and NF +T (K) ⊂ K.
Proof. The ﬁrst inclusion follows trivially from the deﬁnition of K(t). Take x ∈ K(t). Using deﬁni-
tion (22) and (13) we concluded that

kx − x0k ≤ t,

kLF (x, 0)−1 − xk ≤ −

f (t)
f ′(t)

,

t < nf (t) < t∗.

(24)

Deﬁnition of Newton iteration mapping in (21) implies that for all x ∈ K(t) we have

kNF +T (x) − x0k ≤ kx − x0k + kNF +T (x) − xk = kx − x0k + kLF (x, 0)−1 − xk,

and consequently, using (13) and (24), the last inequality imply

kNF +T (x) − x0k ≤ t −

f (t)
f ′(t)

= nf (t) < t∗.

(25)

For simplify the notations deﬁne x+ = NF +T (x) and y = LF (x+, 0)−1. Thus, from (21) we have

0 ∈ F (x) + F ′(x)(x+ − x) + T (x+),

0 ∈ F (x+) + F ′(x+)(y − x+) + T (y).

8

As T is a maximal monotone, it follows that

hF (x) + F ′(x)(x+ − x) − F (x+) − F ′(x+)(y − x+), y − x+i ≥ 0

which implies that

hF (x) − F (x+) + F ′(x)(x+ − x), y − x+i ≥ hF ′(x+)(y − x+), y − x+i.

(26)

Since, by Lemma 8, \F ′(x) is a positive operator and \F ′(x)

−1

exists, we obtain from Lemma 2 that

ky − x+k2
k \F ′(x+)
k

−1

≤ h \F ′(x+)(y − x+), y − x+i.

(27)

Note that h \F ′(x+)(y − x+), y − x+i = hF ′(x+)(y − x+), y − x+i, this together (27) and (26) yields

that

ky−x+k2 ≤ k \F ′(x+)

−1

khF ′(x+)(y−x+), y−x+i ≤ k \F ′(x+)

−1

khF (x)−F (x+)+F ′(x)(x+−x), y−x+i.

Hence, after simple manipulations, above inequality becomes

ky − x+k ≤ k \F ′(x+)

−1

kkF (x) − F (x+) + F ′(x)(x+ − x)k.

(28)

Due to x+ = NF +T (x) we have from (25) that kx+− x0k ≤ nf (t). Then, taking into account that f ′
is increasing and negative, it follows from (28) , using second part in Lemma 8, (15) and Lemma 7
we obtain that

ky − x+k ≤ −k \F ′(x0)

f ′(nf (t)) kEF (x, x+)k ≤

−1

k

−1

f ′(nf (t))

ef (t, nf (t)) kx+ − xk2
(nf (t) − t)2 .

(29)

On the other hand, using the deﬁnition (13), after some manipulations we conclude that

f (nf (t)) = f (nf (t)) − [f (t) + f ′(t)(nf (t) − t)] = ef (t, nf (t)),

and because x+ = NF +T (x), (13) and the second inequality in (24) imply kx − x+k ≤ nf (t) − t,
thus inequality in (29) becomes

ky − x+k ≤ −

f (nf (t))
f ′(nf (t))

.

Therefore, since (25) implies kx+ − x0k ≤ nf (t) we conclude that the second inclusion of the
proposition is proved.
The third inclusion K ⊆ B(x0, t∗) follows trivially from (22) and (23). To prove the last inclusion
NF +T (K) ⊂ K, take x ∈ K. Thus x ∈ K(t) for some t ∈ [0, t∗). From the second inclusion of the
proposition, we have NF +T (x) ∈ K(nf (t)). Since nf (t) ∈ [0, t∗) and using the deﬁnition of K in
(23) we concluded the proof.

3.2 Convergence analysis

To prove the convergence result, which is a consequence of the above results, ﬁrstly we note that
the deﬁnition (20) implies that the sequence {xk} deﬁned in (8), can be formally stated by

xk+1 = NF +T (xk),

k = 0, 1, . . . ,

(30)

9

or equivalently,

0 ∈ F (xk) + F ′(xk)(xk+1 − xk) + T (xk+1),

k = 0, 1, . . . .

First we will show that the sequence generated by Newton method is well behaved with respect to
the set deﬁned in (22).

Corollary 10. The sequence {xk} is well deﬁned, is contained in B(x0, t∗), converges to a point
x∗ ∈ B[x0, t∗] satisfying 0 ∈ F (x∗) + T (x∗). Moreover, xk ∈ K(tk), for k = 0, 1 . . . and

Proof. From assumption in (7), Remark 4, assumption h1 and deﬁnitions (22) and (23) we have

kx∗ − xkk ≤ t∗ − tk,

k = 0, 1 . . . .

{x0} = K(0) ⊂ K.

(31)

We know from Lemma 9 that NF +T (K) ⊂ K. Thus, using (31) and (30) we conclude that the
sequence {xk} is well deﬁned and rests in K. From the ﬁrst inclusion on second part of the Lemma 9
we have trivially that {xk} is contained in B(x0, t∗). To prove the convergence, ﬁrst we are going
to prove by induction that
(32)
The above inclusion, for k = 0, follows from (31). Assume now that xk ∈ K(tk). Then combining
Lemma 9, (30) and (13) we conclude that xk+1 ∈ K(tk+1), which completes the induction proof.
Now, using (32) and (22) we have

xk ∈ K(tk),

k = 0, 1 . . . .

kLF (xk, 0)−1 − xkk ≤ −

f (tk)
f ′(tk)

,

k = 0, 1 . . . ,

which, combined with (30) and (8) becomes

kxk+1 − xkk ≤ tk+1 − tk,

k = 0, 1 . . . .

(33)

Taking into account that {tk} converges to t∗, we easily conclude from the above inequality that

∞Xk=k0

kxk+1 − xkk ≤

∞Xk=k0

tk+1 − tk = t∗ − tk0 < +∞,

for any k0 ∈ N. Hence, we conclude that {xk} is a Cauchy sequence in B(x0, t∗) and thus it
converges to some x∗ ∈ B[x0, t∗]. Therefore, using again (33) we also conclude that the inequality
in the corollary holds.
Since −F (xk) − F ′(xk)(xk+1 − xk) ∈ T (xk+1), F is a continuously diﬀerentiable mapping, xk

converges to x∗ and T is maximal monotone, we conclude that 0 ∈ F (x∗) + T (x∗).

We have already proved that the sequence {xk} converges to a solution x∗ of generalized equation
F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 and x∗ ∈ B(x0, t∗). Now, we will prove that this convergence is Q-linearly and
that x∗ is the unique solution of F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 in B(x0, t∗). Furthermore, by assuming that f
satisﬁes h4, we will also prove that {xk} converges Q-quadratically to x∗. For that, we need of the
following result:

10

Lemma 11. Take x, y ∈ B(x0, R) and 0 ≤ t < v < R. If

kx − x0k ≤ t,
then the following inequality holds

t ≤ t∗,

ky − xk ≤ v − t,

f (v) ≤ 0,

0 ∈ F (y) + T (y),

(34)

ky − NF +T (x)k ≤ [v − nf (t)]ky − xk2
(v − t)2 .

Proof. For simplify the notations deﬁne z = NF +T (x). Since 0 ∈ F (y) + T (y) using (21) and that
T is maximal monotone we have

which, after simple manipulations, implies that

h−F (x) + F ′(x)(x − z) + F (y), z − yi ≥ 0,

hF (y) − F (x) + F ′(x)(x − y), z − yi ≥ hF ′(x)(z − y), z − yi.

Since kx− x0k ≤ t < t∗ we obtain by Lemma 8 that \F ′(x) is a positive operator and \F ′(x)

Thus from Lemma 2 we have

−1

kz − yk2
k\F ′(x)
k

−1

≤ h\F ′(x)(z − y), z − yi.

(35)

exists.

(36)

Combining h\F ′(x)(z − y), z − yi = hF ′(x)(z − y), z − yi, with (36) and (35) yields that

ky − zk2 ≤ k\F ′(x)

−1

khF ′(x)(z − y), z − yi ≤ k\F ′(x)

−1

khF (y) − F (x) + F ′(x)(x − y), z − yi.

Hence, after simple manipulations, above inequality becomes

ky − zk ≤ k\F ′(x)

−1

kkF (y) − F (x) + F ′(x)(x − y)k.

(37)

Now, using Lemma 8 and Lemma 7 together with the assumptions of the lemma we obtain

ky − zk ≤ −1

f ′(t)

ef (t, v)ky − xk2
(v − t)2 .

As, 0 ≤ t < t∗, f ′(t) < 0. Using deﬁnition of ef (t, v), (13) and the assumption f (v) ≤ 0 we have

ef (t, v)
f ′(t)

−

= v − t +

f (t)
f ′(t) −

f (v)
f ′(t) ≤ v − t +

f (t)
f ′(t)

= v − nf (t).

To end the proof, combine the two above inequalities.

Corollary 12. The sequences {xk} and {tk} satisfy the following inequality
k = 0, 1 . . . .

kx∗ − xk+1k ≤

t∗ − tk+1
(t∗ − tk)2kx∗ − xkk2,

As a consequence, the sequence {xk} converges Q-linearly to the solution x∗ as follows

kx∗ − xk+1k ≤

1
2kx∗ − xkk,

k = 0, 1 . . . .

(38)

(39)

Additionally, if f satisﬁes h4 then the sequence {xk} converges Q-quadratically to x∗ as follows

kx∗ − xk+1k ≤

D−f ′(t∗)

−2f ′(t∗) kx∗ − xkk2,

11

k = 0, 1 . . . .

(40)

Proof. For each k, we can apply Lemma 11 with x = xk, y = x∗, t = tk and v = t∗, to obtain

kx∗ − NF +T (xk)k ≤ [t∗ − nf (tk)]kx∗ − xkk2
(t∗ − tk)2 .

Thus inequality (38) follows from the above inequality, (30) and (14). Note that by the ﬁrst part
in Lemma 5, (14) and Corollary 10 we have

t∗ − tk+1
t∗ − tk ≤

1
2

,

kx∗ − xkk
t∗ − tk ≤ 1.

Combining these inequalities with (38) we obtain (39). Now, assume that h4 holds. Then, by
Corollary 6, the second inequality on (11) holds, which combined with (38) imply (40).

Corollary 13. The limit x∗ of the sequence {xk} is the unique solution of the generalized equation
F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 in B[x0, t∗].
Proof. Suppose there exist y∗ ∈ B[x0, t∗] such that y∗ is solution of F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0. We will prove
by induction that
(41)
The case k = 0 is trivial, because t0 = 0 and y∗ ∈ B[x0, t∗]. We assume that the inequality holds for
some k. First note that Corollary 10 implies that xk ∈ K(tk), for k = 0, 1 . . .. Thus, from deﬁnition
of K(tk) we conclude that kxk − x0k ≤ tk, for k = 0, 1 . . .. Since kxk − x0k ≤ tk, we may apply
Lemma 11 with x = xk, y = y∗, t = tk and v = t∗ to obtain

ky∗ − xkk ≤ t∗ − tk,

k = 0, 1, . . . .

ky∗ − NF +T (xk)k ≤ [t∗ − nf (tk)]ky∗ − xkk2
(t∗ − tk)2 .

Using inductive hypothesis, (30) and (14) we obtain, from latter inequality, that (41) holds for k + 1.
Since xk converges to x∗ and tk converges to t∗, from (41) we conclude that y∗ = x∗. Therefore, x∗
is the unique solution of F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 in B[x0, t∗].

4 Some special cases

In this section, we will present some special cases of Theorem 4. When F ≡ {0} and f ′ satisﬁes
a Lipschitz-type condition, we will obtain a particular instance of Theorem 4, which retrieves the
classical convergence theorem on Newton’s method under the Lipschitz condition; see [16, 23]. A
version of Smale’s theorem on Newton’s method for analytical functions is obtained in Theorem 15.

4.1 Under Lipschitz-type condition

In this section, we will present a version of classical convergence theorem for Newton’s method
under Lipschitz-type condition for generalized equations. The classical version for F ≡ {0} have
appeared in Rall [16] and Traub and Wozniakowski [23].

Theorem 14. Let H be a Hilbert space, Ω be an open nonempty subset of H, F : Ω → H be
continuous with Fr´echet derivative F ′ continuous, T : H ⇒ H be a set-valued operator and x0 ∈ Ω.
Suppose that F ′(x0) is a positive operator and \F ′(x0)
exists and, there exists a constant K > 0
such that B(x0, 1/K) ⊂ Ω and

Moreover, suppose that

(43)
Then, the sequence {xk} generated by Newton’s method for solving F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 with starting
point x0
(44)

kx1 − x0k ≤ b.

k = 0, 1, . . . ,

F (xk) + F ′(xk)(xk+1 − xk) + T (xk+1) ∋ 0,

is well deﬁned, is contained in B(x0, t∗) and converges to the point x∗ which is the unique solution

of F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 in B(x0, t∗), where t∗ = 1−√1 − 2bK/K. Moreover, the sequence {xk} satisﬁes

for any k = 0, 1, . . . ,

kx∗ − xk+1k ≤

K

2√1 − 2bK kx∗ − xkk2.

Proof. Since f : [0, 1/K) → R, deﬁned by f (t) := (K/2)t2 − t + b, is a majorant function for F at
point x0, the result follows by invoking Theorem 4, applied to this particular context.

Remark 5. The above result contain, as particular instance, several theorem on Newton’s method;
see, for example, Rall [16], Traub and Wozniakowski [23] and Daniel [3]. See also [?].

4.2 Under Smale’s-type condition

In this section, we will present a version of classical convergence theorem for Newton’s method under
Smale’s-type condition for generalized equations. The classical version has appeared in corollary of
Proposition 3 pp. 195 of Smale [22], see also Proposition 1 pp. 157 and Remark 1 pp. 158 of Blum,
Cucker, Shub, and Smale [1]; see also [7].

Theorem 15. Let H be a Hilbert space, Ω be an open nonempty subset of H, F : Ω → H be an
analytic function, T : H ⇒ H be a set-valued operator and x0 ∈ Ω. Suppose that F ′(x0) is a positive
operator and \F ′(x0)

exists. Suppose that

(45)

(46)

Moreover, suppose that B(x0, 1/γ) and there exists b > 0 such that

and α := bγ ≤ 3 − 2√2. Then the sequence {xk} generated by Newton’s method for solving F (x) +
T (x) ∋ 0 with starting point x0

F (xk) + F ′(xk)(xk+1 − xk) + T (xk+1) ∋ 0,

k = 0, 1, . . . ,

(47)

is well deﬁned, is contained in B(x0, t∗) and converges to the point x∗ which is the unique solution

of F (x) + T (x) ∋ 0 in B[x0, t∗], where t∗ = (α + 1−p(α + 1)2 − 8α)/4γ. Moreover, {xk} converges

Q-linearly as follows

kx∗ − xk+1k ≤

1
2kx∗ − xkk,

k = 0, 1, . . . .

Additionally, if α < 3 − 2√2, then {xk} converges Q-quadratically as follows

kx∗ − xk+1k ≤

γ

(1 − γt∗)[2(1 − γt∗)2 − 1]kx∗ − xkk2,

k = 0, 1, . . . .

Before proving above theorem we need of two results. The next results gives a condition that is
easier to check than condition (6), whenever the functions under consideration are twice continuously
diﬀerentiable, and its proof follows the same path of Lemma 21 of [?].

Lemma 16. Let Ω ⊂ H be an open set, and let F : Ω → H be an analytic function. Suppose that
x0 ∈ Ω and B(x0, 1/γ) ⊂ Ω, where γ is deﬁned in (45). Then for all x ∈ B(x0, 1/γ), it holds that
kF ′′(x)k ≤ 2γ/(1 − γkx − x0k)3.

The next result gives a relationship between the second derivatives F ′′ and f ′′, which allow us

to show that F and f satisfy (6), and its proof is similar to Lemma 22 of [8].

Lemma 17. Let H be a Hilbert space, Ω ⊆ H be an open set, F : Ω → H be twice continuously
diﬀerentiable. Let x0 ∈ Ω, R > 0 and κ = sup{t ∈ [0, R) : B(x0, t) ⊂ Ω}. Let f : [0, R) → R be
twice continuously diﬀerentiable such that k \F ′(x0)
kkF ′′(x)k 6 f ′′(kx − x0k), for all x ∈ B(x0, κ),

−1

then F and f satisfy (6).

[Proof of Theorem 15]. Consider f : [0, 1/γ) → R deﬁned by f (t) = t/(1− γt)− 2t + b. Note that
f is analytic and f (0) = b, f ′(t) = 1/(1− γt)2 − 2, f ′(0) = −1, f ′′(t) = 2γ/(1− γt)3. It follows from
the last equalities that f satisﬁes h1 and h2. Combining Lemma 17 with Lemma 16, we conclude
that F and f satisfy (6). Therefore, the result follows by applying the Theorem 4.

5 Final remarks

We have obtained a semi local convergence result to Newton’s method for solving generalized equa-
tion in Hilbert spaces and under the majorant condition. The majorant condition allow to unify
several convergence results pertaining to Newton’s method. Besides, the study of inexact versions
of this method would be welcome.
