Out-of-equilibrium systems can host phenomena that transcend the usual restrictions of equilib-
rium systems. Here we unveil how out-of-equilibrium states, prepared via a quantum quench, can
exhibit a non-zero Hall-type response that persists at long times, and even when the instantaneous
Hamiltonian is time reversal symmetric; both these features starkly contrast with equilibrium Hall
currents. Interestingly, the persistent Hall eﬀect arises from processes beyond those captured by
linear response, and is a signature of the novel dynamics in out-of-equilibrium systems. We propose
quenches in two-band Dirac systems as natural venues to realize persistent Hall currents, which
exist when either mirror or time-reversal symmetry are broken (before or after the quench).
Its
long time persistence, as well as sensitivity to symmetry breaking, allow it to be used as a sensitive
diagnostic of the complex out-equilibrium dynamics readily controlled and probed in cold-atomic
optical lattice experiments.

The subtle quantum coherence encoded in the topology
of crystal wavefunctions is responsible for a wide array of
robust quantum phenomena [1–4], e.g. the quantum Hall
eﬀect. While these concepts originated in the solid-state,
cold atoms have recently become a system of choice for
experimentally unraveling topology on the microscopic
level [5–7] due to the array of new probes available. For
example, these probes have been used to image the skip-
ping orbits (edge-states) in a cold-atomic quantum Hall
system [8], directly measure the Berry curvature [9], and
Zak phase [10] in cold-atomic topological bands.

One readily available tool is the quantum quench. A
state is prepared in the many-body ground state of a
Hamiltonian H(ζ). After which, a physical parameter
ζ (e.g. lattice depth, detuning) is changed suddenly (Fig.
1a), setting the system into dynamical evolution far from
equilibrium [11]. The ease with which distinct Hamilto-
nians can be accessed via quenches and driving in gen-
eral opens up a tantalizing possibility of achieving new
out-of-equilibrium phenomena with no equilibrium ana-
log [12–19].

Here we unveil a completely new type of dynamical re-
sponse achieved in out-of-equilibrium states (OES) which
can be prepared via quantum quenches.
In particular,
we show that certain OES can feature an unconven-
tional Hall current even when the instantaneous Hamil-
tonian preserves time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Intrigu-
ingly, when a short-time pulsed electric ﬁeld is applied to
OES, the Hall current generated persists even long after
the pulse application, saturating to a non-zero value at
long times (Fig. 1). These characteristics have no analog
in equilibrium systems, and, as we argue, originate from
coherent evolution of the wavefunction after a quantum
quench.

The origin of the unconventional, quench-induced re-
sponse can be most easily illustrated for non-interacting
and clean Dirac systems, where many-body states can be
represented as a collection of pseudospinors on a Bloch

ground state of a Dirac Hamiltonian H(∆), with TRS
breaking gap ∆ (Fig. 1a). At t = 0, the Hamiltonian is
quenched to H(∆ = 0) [where TRS is preserved], yield-
ing dynamics for OES, with the pseudospinors exhibiting

can be applied to the system at time t = t1 (Fig. 1a,e),
shifting the Larmor orbits along E. Averaged over one-
cycle, longitudinal momentum along E increases. How-
ever, in addition to this, the constraint of pseudospinors
being on the Bloch sphere allows a transverse shift to ac-
cumulate. As a result, at long times t = t2, we obtain an
unconventional Hall current

JHall(t1, t2 → ∞) = Σ∞Hall(t1)ˆz × A,

(1)

that persists long after the pulse E(t) as shown in Fig. 1e.
Here Σ∞Hall is non-universal function depending on t1 and
model speciﬁcs described below. Additionally, while we
use the language of electromagnetic response, in cold-
atom optical lattices eA can be easily eﬀected by a shift
in momentum ∆p brought on by a sudden force; in such
systems JHall takes the form of a particle current.

Hall currents from OES (Eq. (1), Fig. 1e) are strikingly
diﬀerent to those found in equilibrium systems. Hall cur-
rents generated by short pulses in the latter vanish at
long times after the pulse is applied, are dissipationless,
and do not involve the shift of the Fermi sea.
In con-
trast, OES Hall currents persist even at long times, and
involve overall momentum shifts of the entire Fermi sea.
As a result, we expect that when the Fermi sea relaxes,
the Hall current will degrade.

Further, we consider the non-interacting and clean
(disorder-free) limit to highlight the role coherent evolu-
tion of the wavefunction has in forming JHall (see Larmor
precession in Fig. 1b-d). A useful analogy with the co-
herent evolution of spins in nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) protocols can be drawn, where decay of the NMR
signal can be used as a sensitive diagnostic of scattering,
for e.g. spin-spin, spin-environment relaxation.
In the
same way, we anticipate that the decay proﬁle of JHall
that arises from coherent pseudospinor evolution can be
used as a diagnostic of relaxation and/or thermalization
processes in OES when interactions are allowed.

The ease with which Dirac-type [9] and other spin-orbit
coupled Hamiltonians [5] can be constructed in setups for
ultra-cold bosons and fermions allows these eﬀects to be
easily accessed—though we ﬁnd that fermions more read-
ily see these eﬀects. In order to observe the Hall eﬀect
and separate it from an overwhelming longitudinal re-
sponse, we propose a time-of-ﬂight setup in the direction
perpendicular to the applied pulse while keeping a con-
ﬁning potential in the direction of the applied pulse. In
such an experimental set-up, the gap, as tuned by Zee-
man coupling or “shaking” of the cold atom lattice, is
suddenly turned oﬀ. The “pulse” is then implemented
some time after the quench by applying a sudden and
brief force upon the system (e.g. tilting the conﬁning po-
tential for a very short time).

Let us now explain the eﬀect with a two-band Hamil-

tonian H(∆) =(cid:80)

p c†ph(p, ∆)cp with

h(p, ∆) = 0(p)I + d(p, ∆(t)) · σ,

(2)

where p = (px, py) is the two-dimensional momentum
and σ = (σx, σy, σz) are the Pauli matrices, and ∆(t) is
a gap parameter that varies as a function of time. When
d(p, ∆(t)) varies slowly, the equilibrium wavefunction de-
scribes the properties of H. However, when d(p, ∆(t))
changes rapidly as in a quantum quench, the response
depends intimately on the evolution of the wavefunction.
To illustrate this, we ﬁrst analyze a simple example
that captures the essential physics - a quenched, single-
cone, low-energy Haldane-type model - obeying Eq. (2)
with

0(p) = 0, d(p, ∆(t)) = (px, py, ∆Θ[−t]),

(3)

where Θ(t) is the Heaviside function. This captures the
essential physics of the usual two-cone Haldane model,
hence the name. The physics described below does not
change if we use a two-cone Haldane model, the only
diﬀerence being an extra degeneracy factor of two.
If,
on the other hand, a gap was created by breaking in-
version symmetry, the eﬀects described here would be
identically zero. When t < 0, it is convenient to de-
scribe the system [Eqs. (2),(3)] by the familiar ground
state wavefunction of the Haldane model in a single cone

wavefunction is characterized by a Chern number C =
(2π)2 ˆz · ∇p × (cid:104)up|i∇p|up(cid:105). For the half-ﬁlled band in
|Ψ0(cid:105) we have C = 1/2 per ﬂavor. As a result, |Ψ0(cid:105) fea-
tures a bulk Hall conductivity of σxy = Ce2/h. When
t > 0, the wavefunction evolves with |Ψ1(t)(cid:105) = U(t)|Ψ0(cid:105),
with U(t) = exp[−iHt], so that
|Ψ1(t)(cid:105) =

where ft = cos θp
2 sin pt, and gt =
sin θp
2 cos pt + i cos θp
2 sin pt. Interestingly, at every point
in time, the instantaneous wavefunction, |Ψ1(t)(cid:105), is still
characterized by the same Chern number C = 1/2 as |Ψ0(cid:105)
before the quench [14, 18]. However, as we argue below,
the current response becomes disconnected from C [i.e.
the equilibrium bulk current responses corresponding to
C described above no longer apply]. Instead, |Ψ1(cid:105) is char-
acterized by an unconventional current response.
To extract the response properties of Eq. (4) we con-
sider the following pulse-type protocol [see Fig. 1] where
(i) at t = t1 a short pulse [Ex(t) = Axδ(t − t1)] is ap-
plied to the system so that p → p − eA, (ii) and the
Hall current, JHall, that develops is measured at t = t2.
Here t1, t2 > 0 occur after the quench. We note that
after the pulse at t1, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (3) changes

in Eq. (4) continues to evolve as |Ψ2(t2)(cid:105) =(cid:81)

d(p, 0) → d(p − eA, 0). As a result, the wavefunction
p |ψ2(p)(cid:105),
with |ψ2(p)(cid:105) = e−i(t2−t1)h(p−eA,0) |ψ1(p, t1)(cid:105).
The current response can be obtained via J = (cid:104)Ψ|ˆj|Ψ(cid:105),
where ˆj = ∂H/∂A. Using |Ψ(cid:105) = |Ψ2(t2)(cid:105), Eq. (3),(4),
and extracting the component of J transverse to the ap-
plied ﬁeld E, we obtain JHall as shown in Fig. 1e. Here,
JHall was obtained via numerical integration with a pre-
quench |Ψ0(cid:105) where the entire valence band was ﬁlled. A
full discussion of J is contained in the supplement [20].
Due to the collective action of all electrons in the va-
lence band, JHall does not have an apparent oscillatory
structure in Fig. 1e.

Strikingly, JHall in Fig. 1e grows from zero (when the
pulse is ﬁrst applied at t1) and saturates at long times
to a non-vanishing value, JHall(t1, t2 → ∞) = J∞Hall(t1)
as seen in Fig. 1e. As we argue below, this behavior is
generic for OES and its qualitative behavior is indepen-
dent of model speciﬁcs. The non-zero J∞Hall(t1) is un-
conventional and arises from the near-lockstep Larmor
precession of the pseudospinors |ψ1(p)(cid:105) in Eq. (4) that
form the full many-body OES |Ψ1(cid:105).
We can understand this geometrically by consider-
ing Larmor precession of the pseudospins on the Bloch
sphere. Even though we are interested in quenches de-
ﬁned in Eq. (3), the following geometrical analysis is
general and applies to two-band models. Mapping each
spinor onto the Bloch sphere via ˆn = (cid:104)ψ1(p)|σ|ψ1(p)(cid:105),
we can describe the Larmor precession of the spinors via
the equations of motion:
∂t ˆn = 2d(p, 0) × ˆn,

ˆn(t = 0) = −ˆd(p, ∆).

To understand why this implies a persistent current, con-
sider a ring of momenta with |p| = p held constant. With
Larmor precession for t > 0, they will oscillate around a
point on the equator, see Fig. 2a,d. Then, at time t = t1
we apply a pulse. As shown by the red arrow in Fig. 2b,
the pulse has the eﬀect of shifting the center of rotation
for Larmor precession d(p, 0) → d(p − eA, 0). As a re-
sult, at long times the shift in average ˆn persists (see
Fig. 2b,c,e). Since the direction of the pseudospin, ˆn di-
rectly corresponds to the direction of current ﬂow in the
Haldane model, a Hall current can persist at long times.
We note that the long-time average of ˆn is just its
projection at time t1 along the new precession direc-
tion d(p − eA, 0) yielding [ˆn(t1) · ˆd(p − eA, 0)]ˆd(p −
eA, 0). Next we note that the current operator is ˆjµ =
−e∂pµh(p− eA, 0) = −e∂pµd(p− eA, 0)· σ. As a result,
the projection of average ˆn along ∂pµd(p − eA, 0) yields
the current. Combining these, we obtain an expression
for the long-time current for a single momentum state p
j∞µ (p, t1) = −e[ˆn(p, t1) · ˆd(p − eA, 0)]∂pµ d(p − eA, 0).

The expression in Eq. (6) is independent of a speciﬁc
two-band model [21].

the Bloch sphere. b. After the pulse, the center of Larmor
precession shifts due to the momentum boost eA/c. c. For
long times, the shift in the state’s average over a Larmor
period, ˆn(t2), persists leading to a current at t2 → ∞. d. For
the Haldane model, Eq. (3), the orange manifold represents
the combined Larmor orbits of states with the same |p|. e.
After the pulse, the manifold of Larmor orbits changes to give
a perpendicular shift in the average ˆn(t2) resulting in J∞
Hall.

We now consider the quench speciﬁed in Eq. (3) so
that n(t1) = (cid:104)ψ1|σ|ψ1(cid:105) reads as n(t1) = −p sin θp +
(cos 2pt1 ˆz − sin 2pt1 ˆz × ˆp) cos θp (using Eq. (4)). Inte-
grating over all p (for a ﬁlled band prior to quench), we

While |ψ1(p)(cid:105) with similar energies precess with fre-

their Larmor orbits to slowly drift out of phase, degrad-
ing J∞Hall(t1). Analyzing Eq. (8) for large t1, we obtain

This aging behavior is a characteristic of the diﬀerent

Importantly, persistent J∞Hall does not occur in equilib-
rium systems; in fact, it is disallowed due to the existence
of a ﬁnite DC conductivity even without disorder. To
see this, consider the response in equilibrium captured by

jy(t) =(cid:82) σyx(t−t(cid:48))Ex(t(cid:48))dt(cid:48). For a pulse Ex(t) = Axδ(t),
(cid:82) jy(t)dt. As

Σ∞Hall =(cid:82) dpχ∞Hall(p), where χ∞Hall = 1

we have jy(t) = σyx(t)Ax. Thus σDC
a result, for σDC
yx that is ﬁnite (e.g., the anomalous and
conventional Hall eﬀect, the quantum Hall eﬀect), then
jy(t) → 0 as t → ∞ due to integrability.
OES Hall currents in Eq. (1) depend intimately on
in
the underlying symmetries of the Hamiltonian, h,
Eq. (2). In particular, we ﬁnd Σ∞Hall depends on the ab-
sence of either mirror, M−1
y h(px, py)My = h(px,−py),
or time-reversal, T −1h(−p)T = h(p), symmetry. To ex-
pose this, we analyze the contribution of p states to the
persistent response in Eq. (6). Expanding in the pulse
strength A, we obtain j∞µ (p, t1) ≈ χ∞µν(p, t1)Aν. Indeed
2 (χ∞yx − χ∞xy). Writ-
ing d0 = d(p, 0) yields χ∞Hall = χ∞M + χ∞T , where χ∞M =
ˆd0 ·
e2∂[py d0∂px]
ˆd0× ˆd sin 2d0t1. Here the brackets ∂[py ··· ∂px] denote an-
tisymmetrization, and M and T subscripts denote contri-
butions controlled by My and T . Importantly, if h pos-
sesses My-symmetry, then χ∞M (px, py) = −χ∞M (px,−py).
if h possesses T -symmetry, then
On the other hand,
χ∞T (p) = −χ∞T (−p) (see supplement [20]). As a result,
when h satisﬁes both My and T symmetries (before and
after quench), opposing momentum states will give con-

tributions of opposite sign, and Σ∞Hall =(cid:82) dpχ∞Hall(p) =

ˆd0 · ˆd cos 2d0t1, and χ∞T = −e2∂[py d0∂px]

0. Hence, ﬁnite Σ∞Hall arises from breaking of either My
or T symmetry before or after the quench [22] in con-
trast to the symmetry requirements for Hall currents in
equilibrium linear response [23].

While OES Hall response is disconnected from the
Chern number, C, Σ∞Hall can still be expressed in terms
of bulk band properties. In particular, for My symmetric
Hamiltonians with a ﬁlled band prior to quench, we ﬁnd
an equivalent TKNN-like formula

is manifestly distinct from C and is not quantized.
Finally, we examine other quench protocols for Eq. (2).
As we will see, these yield similar responses to the Hal-
dane protocol examined above. One interesting example
is a Rashba type protocol where

Indeed,

For t2 → ∞, the Hall current response levels out
its persistent response, J∞Hall,
(Fig. 3a,b).
matches the Haldane protocol closely (see Fig. 3a), ex-
cept in one important way. In the Rashba protocol, it
takes a ﬁnite t1 for the J∞Hall to “turn-on”: magnitude
J∞Hall increases from zero at small t1, and decreases at
long t1. In contrast, the Haldane protocol featured J∞Hall
that was maximal at t1 → 0+. This diﬀerence also arises
due to the momentum cutoﬀ which does not appear in
the low-energy model of Eq. (3) where there exist states
on the Bloch sphere that have already performed multi-
ple Larmor orbits even for an inﬁnitesimal t1, yielding a
large J∞Hall.

Quench type protocols exhibiting J∞Hall can also be re-
alized in lattice models.
In these, the bands are ﬁnite
as opposed to the continuum bands discussed above. We
illustrate such a protocol for a “half-BHZ” type model in
a square lattice [24], wherein Eq. (2) takes 0(p) = 0 and
vF
a (sin apx , sin apy , M (t) + 2 − cos apx −
d(p, M (t)) =
cos apy ). Here M (t < 0) = M and M (t > 0) = M(cid:48) rep-
resents the quench, and a is the lattice constant. In the
ground state, this model has diﬀerent topological phases
represented by M [25] Picking M, M(cid:48) values allows to
quench within and between the trivial and topological
phases, yielding a persistent Hall current as well (Fig. 3c).
As in the case of the Rashba Hamiltonian, there is “turn-

The general framework, as well as the speciﬁc model
realizations, presented here demonstrate that OES pre-
pared via quench can manifest Hall currents that persist
long after the application of an excitation pulse. Strik-
ingly, they occur under diﬀerent symmetry requirements
than that found in equilibrium systems and can arise even
when the instantaneous Hamiltonian is TRS preserving.
The experimental conditions necessary for probing OES
are readily available in current cold atom setups [26]: the
persistent, quench-induced Hall currents described can
be measured via time-of-ﬂight and provides a new diag-
nostic of coherent wavefunction dynamics. The Hall re-
sponse of OES depend intimately on the entire history of
wavefunction evolution unlike in equilibrium. This opens
a new vista of unconventional phenomena that can be
prepared and probed in OES.

As we were ﬁnalizing this manuscript, we became
aware of the related work of Hu, Zoller, and Budich
[27]. Complementary to our work, they consider non-
equilibrium Hall responses in the linear response regime
in a ramp from a trivial to a topological phase.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL TO: PERSISTENT HALL RESPONSE IN A QUANTUM QUENCH

GENERAL THEORY OF QUENCH-PULSE

PROTOCOL – SINGLE PARTICLE

so that H = (cid:80)

In the single-particle framework, we work with a
Hamiltonian diagonalized into (Bloch) wave vectors h(k),
k c†kh(k)ck. We begin by preparing our
state as the ground state of some Hamiltonian h(k, λ)
where λ is some parameter to be quenched by bringing it
to zero at t = 0. At t = 0 we quench to h0(k) = h(k, 0),
and we evolve for a time t1 with this Hamiltonian. At
t = t1 we then pulse the system with an electric ﬁeld
for a time shorter than time-scales in the problem, so
that we can represent it by a shift in the Hamiltonian
h0(k − eA) ≡ hA(k). After evolution under this pulsed
Hamiltonian for a time t = t2, we then measure the cur-
rent.

This whole process can be represented by the following

ﬁnal state

|ψ2(cid:105) = e−ihA(k)(t2−t1)e−ih0(k)t1 |ψ0(cid:105) ,

(12)

where h(k, λ)|ψ0(cid:105) = |ψ0(cid:105) (suppressing dependence on k
and λ). To easily identify the state right before we pulse,
we deﬁne

|ψ1(cid:105) = e−ih0t1 |ψ0(cid:105) .

(13)

The current operator in single-particle quantum me-

chanics can easily be written as jA = −e∇khA (for the

current when measured at time t2).

In order to display the role of quantum geometry, we

write the expectation value in a suggestive fashion

(cid:104)ψ2|jA|ψ2(cid:105) = −e∇k (cid:104)ψ1|hA|ψ1(cid:105)

+ e[(cid:104)∇kψ2|hA|ψ2(cid:105) + (cid:104)ψ2|hA|∇kψ2(cid:105)].

(14)

Here we introduce two objects, E(k; λ, t1) = (cid:104)ψ1|hA|ψ1(cid:105)
is the energy of the state after the pulse, and

Ft2,kµ = i(cid:104)∂t2ψ2|∂kµ ψ2(cid:105) − i(cid:104)∂kµψ2|∂t2 ψ2(cid:105)

(15)

is the Berry curvature of the evolving state (a function
of k, λ, t1, and t2). This can be introduced into the ex-
pression for current Eq. (14) with use of the Schr¨odinger
equation i∂t2 |ψ2(cid:105) = hA |ψ2(cid:105).
sentation)

With these ingredients, we have (in coordinate repre-

(cid:104)ψ2|jA,µ|ψ2(cid:105) = −e(∂kµE + Ft2kµ).

(16)

We can now further investigate how this expression
looks in terms of energies pre-quench. In that case, we
assume a linear dependence on k in our Hamiltonian (or
if not, that e|A| (cid:28) k), then we have

E = (cid:104)ψ1|h0 − eAν∂kν h0|ψ1(cid:105) ,
= E0 − eAν(∂νE0 + Ft1kν ),

(17)

(18)

where we have deﬁned E0 = (cid:104)ψ0|h0|ψ0(cid:105) and Ft1kν =
i(cid:104)∂t1ψ1|∂kν ψ1(cid:105) − i(cid:104)∂kν ψ1|∂t1 ψ1(cid:105).
This allows us to write a general expression for the
current as

(cid:104)ψ2|jA,µ|ψ2(cid:105) = −e(∂kµE0 − eAν∂kµ∂kν E0

− eAν∂kµFt1kν + Ft2kµ).

(19)

Note: This is approximate when the Hamiltonian is
not linearly dependent on k. Also, the Berry curvature
Ft2kµ depends strongly on A. This somewhat compli-
cated structure will manifest itself later when we consider
the particle two-band model.

Relation to the adiabatic anomalous velocity

The derivation of Eq. (16) did not depend on much
except the use of the Schr¨odinger equation and energy
conservation. However, for time-dependent Hamiltonians
we have

(cid:104)ψ(t)|jµ|ψ(t)(cid:105) = −e[∂kµE(t) + Ftkµ].

(20)

To see how this expression relates to anomalous ve-
locities in band structure, consider that |ψ(t)(cid:105) satis-
ﬁes the adiabatic theorem for h0(k − eA(t))|ψ(t)(cid:105) =
(k − eA(t))|ψ(t)(cid:105). As an immediate consequence, we
can expand E(t) = (k − eA(t)) ≈ (k) − eAν∂kν (k).
Additionally, in linear response and ignoring an overall
phase factor that can be gauged away, |ψ(t)(cid:105) = |(k)(cid:105) −
eAν(t)∂kν |(k)(cid:105) + ··· . Thus, ∂t |ψ(t)(cid:105) = −e ˙Aν |∂kν (cid:105),
and we can write the Berry curvature as
Ftkµ = −e ˙Aν(t)Ωkν kµ ,

(21)

where the Berry curvature Ωkν kµ is entirely in the
ground-state manifold.

Combining these, we have
(cid:104)jµ(cid:105) = −e[∂kµ  − e∂kµ Aν∂kν  − e ˙Aν(t)Ωkν kµ ].

(22)

We can rewrite this, recalling that j = −e ˙x, and mak-
2 αβγΩkβ kγ ˆeα. The end

ing a vector out of Ω with Ω = 1
result is

(cid:104) ˙x(cid:105) = ∇k − e∇k(A(t) · ∇k) − eΩ × ˙A(t).

(23)

The ﬁrst term ∇k is the group velocity, the second
term −e∇k(A(t) · ∇k) is the ballistic response, and
2 Ω × ˙A(t) is the anomalous velocity which came di-
− e
rectly from Ftkµ . We note that the ballistic response is
sensitive to scattering such as scattering of impurities.

Persistent currents

When a system is pulsed, it is possible to develop a
persistent current that, without dissipation, lasts long
after the pulse. In the simplest situation, the free particle
retains velocity after a momentum kick.

Returning to the

current
(cid:104)ψ2|jA|ψ2(cid:105), we can expand |ψ2(cid:105) in terms of eigenstates
of the new pulsed Hamiltonian hA(k), in which case

(cid:104)ψ2|jA|ψ2(cid:105) =

(24)

× (cid:104)A,m|ψ1(cid:105) e−i(A,m−A,n)(t2−t1).

(25)

Now, to pick out what will be persistent, we take what
this current is oscillating around, so the only component
we keep is n = m. This crucially depends on the system
having ﬁnite bands with ﬁnite energy gaps.

(cid:104)jA(t2 → ∞)(cid:105) =

(cid:104)A,n|jA|A,n(cid:105)|(cid:104)ψ1|A,n(cid:105)|2.

(26)

(cid:88)

n

And for eigenstates, we have that

(cid:104)A,n|jA|A,n(cid:105) = (cid:104)A,n|∇khA|A,n(cid:105)

= ∇k (cid:104)A,n|hA|A,n(cid:105) = ∇kA,n.

Thus, we have

(cid:104)jA(t2 → ∞)(cid:105) =

(cid:88)

n

(∇kA,n)|(cid:104)ψ1|A,n(cid:105)|2.

Right after the pulse

7

If we measure current directly after the pulse, the state

has not had time to evolve and the current will be

(cid:104)ψ1|jA,µ|ψ1(cid:105) ≈ (cid:104)ψ1|j0,µ|ψ1(cid:105) + Aν (cid:104)ψ1|∂kµ∂kν h0|ψ1(cid:105) .

(31)

For a Hamiltonian linear in k, there is no immediate re-
sponse for the single particle state.

THE “HALDANE” MODEL

We now consider the speciﬁc case of the Haldane
model.
In this model, there are two Dirac cones in a
2D Brillouin zone where one of the cones is (near the
Dirac point)

h(k, ∆) = vFk · σ + ∆σz.

(32)

The second cone is similar except the kinetic energy term
is related by the time-reversal operator T = K (complex
conjugation), but time-reversal symmetry is broken so
∆ → −∆ as well. Breaking of time-reversal symmetry is
essential, otherwise the Hall response we witness below
is just zero.

This procedure is detailed in the following section. We
(1) prepare the state in h(k, ∆), (2) then at t = 0 we
quench to h(k, 0), (3) pulse at t = t1 to h(k− eA, 0), and
(4) measure current at t = t2.

State preparation

Beginning with h(k, ∆), we can prepare the state in
the ground state. This state is represented is represented
by

|ψ0(cid:105) = cos θ

2 |↑(cid:105) − eiφ sin θ

(33)

(34)

(35)

This obscures any play with quantum geometry which

the previous sections elucidated.

Quench and evolve

If we take this one step further to when we perform

the quench, we can write the expression as

(cid:88)
(∇kA,n)|(cid:104)ψ0|eit1h0|A,n(cid:105)|2.

n

(cid:104)jA(t2 → ∞)(cid:105) =

In order to measure the Hall current, we take A and k

perpendicular to each other.

With this state, we quench into h0(k, 0). The time

evolution operator, as can be checked, is

(37)

Thus, our state evolves to

|ψ1(cid:105) = f (t1)|↑(cid:105) − eiφg(t1)|↓(cid:105) ,

where

f (t1) = cos θ
g(t1) = sin θ

2 cos kt1 + i cos θ

2 sin kt1.

8

In order to obtain analytically tractable solutions, we
assume that e|A| (cid:28) k. Without loss of generality, we
take the pulse in the x-direction, and the above expansion
implies

|k − eA| = k − eAx cos φ,
ei(φA−φ) = 1 + i eAx
k sin φ,

(41)

(42)

(38)

(39)

(40)

Pulse

We now consider pulsing the state. The new evolution

operator is the same as the above let k → k − eA.

where eiφA = (kx − eAx) + iky. The time evolution op-
erator can then be appropriately expanded while making
no assumptions regarding the time:

(cid:18)

e−iδt hA =

cos[(k − eAx cos φ)δt]
−i sin[(k − eAx cos φ)δt](1 + i eAx

k sin φ)eiφ

−i sin[(k − eAx cos φ)δt](1 − i eAx
cos[(k − eAx cos φ)δt]

k sin φ)e−iφ

(cid:19)

.

(43)

Here, time δt = t2 − t1. Now, we can evolve our state
with |ψ2(cid:105) = e−i(t2−t1)hA |ψ1(cid:105). The resulting expression
can be deduced by matrix multiplication of Eq. (43) and
Eq. (38).

states up to some chemical potential µ. In this section,
we build up to that by looking ﬁrst at the current of an
individual state at k in the valence band, then of a ring
of states with the same |k|, and ﬁnally at the entire band
itself.

Measuring the current

The current of a single state

We are interested in the current for the entire system
where the k states in the valence band of h(k, ∆) are
fully occupied. This analysis can also be applied for ﬁlled

Having constructed the single-particle state |ψ2(cid:105), we
can calculate the expectation value of jy = −eσy with
the use of

(cid:104)ψ2|σy|ψ2(cid:105) = Im eiφ(cid:8)

−i(|f (t1)|2 − |g(t1)|2)(cid:0)1 + i eAx

k sin φ(cid:1) sin [2(k − eAx cos φ)(t2 − t1)]

−g∗(t1)f (t1)(cid:0)1 + 2i eAx

k sin φ(cid:1) (1 − cos [2(k − eAx cos φ)(t2 − t1)])(cid:9) ,

(44)

and it is easily shown that

|f (t1)|2 − |g(t1)|2 = cos θ cos 2kt1,

f (t1)∗g(t1) = 1

2 (sin θ + i cos θ sin 2kt1).

(45)

(46)

we plot in Fig. 4 the diﬀerence (cid:104)σy(cid:105) − (cid:104)σy(cid:105)|Ax→0.
In
this ﬁgure, note that the pulse can change the frequency,
leading to a beating eﬀect. But for states that have mo-
mentum perpendicular to the pulse (φ = π/2), the center
of oscillation is shifted.

Notice how the persistent current previously alluded
to is already showing up. If one drops out all oscillating
currents and terms that do not depend on Ax, we ob-
tain a term 2 eAx
p sin φ Re eiφg∗f . This term will continue
throughout the calculations, giving the persistent eﬀect.
We note the current is oscillatory. However, to under-
stand how it is deviating from the non-pulsed current,

We still have a persistent eﬀect, and in addition we

This is plotted in Fig. 5.

The current of the whole band

We now ﬁnd the total current Jy(t2; t1) for states orig-
inally loaded entirely in the valence band of the Haldane
model. We have previously assumed k (cid:28) eAx, but here
we will assume ∆/vF (cid:28) eAx since we will be integrating
over all k.

To ﬁnd the total current then, we need to evaluate

diﬃcult to discern, this still oscillates about a ﬁnite, persistent

This die oﬀ with t1 is due to dephasing in the system.

The current itself can be seen for various values of t1 in
Fig. 6. Note that the current starts at zero and grows to
saturate at its persistent value. We note that the order of
limits matters here: If we let t1 = 0 before we integrate,
we would not get any persistent value; however, if we
wait any amount of time, we immediately get the large
persistent value here. This can be understood by how the
states are evolving on the Bloch sphere as we will discuss
in a later section and in the main text.

With all of this, we now look to analyze explicitly the
persistent current. In so doing, we will use to quantum

BLOCH GEOMETRY AND THE PERSISTENT

HALL CURRENT

(61)

Now we consider the Bloch sphere and what it means
to have a persistent current. In our example, the current
is given exclusively by (cid:104)σy(cid:105) which is just the projection

0510152025303540t2∆/¯h−0.20−0.100.000.100.17jy(k;t2)[evF]t1=6.54¯h/∆of our Bloch vector onto the y-axis.

The idea is captured in Figures 7 and 8. The key fea-
ture being: the pulse shifts the center of rotation, in part,
perpendicular to the pulse. Therefore, we get an average
current in that direction that is seen once the system
dephases.

This persistent current can be calculated exactly using
these ideas without the approximation eAx (cid:28) k that we
made in previous sections.

Bloch geometry

Say we have a path on the Bloch sphere r(t) which
rotates around some vector B, then the average of this
path around one cycle can be easily given by a projection
(r(t)· ˆB) ˆB where ˆB = B/B is a unit vector. If we further
want to know how much of this is along the y-direction,
we can project it along y, giving us simply
Y ( ˆB; r(t)) ≡ (r(t) · ˆB)( ˆB · ˆy).

(62)

This quantity represents the persistent current for a par-
ticular state and is independent of t (given r(t) circulat-
ing around ˆB), and when we integrate it over all states we
will obtain the persistent current as previously discussed.
After our mapping to the Bloch sphere, we begin in
a state on there sphere r0, rotate into r1 at time t1 by
precession around the vector 2p. The pulse then causes
precession about the vector B = 2(p − eA), but aver-
aging the result over a period of precession gives exactly
Eq. (62) with r(t) = r1. Therefore, to ﬁnd r1, we look at
the precession of our initial state r0 around the vector 2p
(|ψi(cid:105) is represented by Bloch vector ri here). Mapping
our vector appropriately,

r0 = −ˆp sin θ + ˆz cos θ.

(63)

As we rotate around p at a rate of 2p, we just need to
let ˆz → (cos 2pt ˆz + sin 2pt ˆz × ˆp). Therefore,

11

r1 = −ˆp sin θ + (cos 2pt1 ˆz − sin 2pt1 ˆz × ˆp) cos θ.

(64)

The quantity we are interested in for this problem is

Y (p, φ) =

[r1 · (p − eA)][(p − eA) · ˆy]

|p − eA|2

.

(65)

Imposing A = Ax ˆx, we can begin evaluating

(p − eA) · ˆy = p sin φ.

(66)

Then, in order to evaluate r1 · (p − eA) we ﬁnd

ˆp · (p − eA) = p − eAx cos φ,

(ˆz × ˆp) · (p − eA) = eAx sin φ.

(67)

(68)

These equations imply

Y (p, φ) = p[− sin θ(p−eAx cos φ)−eAx sin 2pt1 cos θ sin φ] sin φ

model following the quench and subsequent pulse with size

And ﬁnally, we can integrate this expression over mo-
mentum to obtain J∞y . Inserting all physical constants:

FIG. 7. The green arrows represent the states being considered: Both have constant p and are at angles φ = ±π/2. The pulse
causes the states to rotate clockwise around a point north of it on the equator (it rotates around the momentum vector p). At
time t1 = π
, both states are on the equator and we apply a pulse eAx > 0. This shifts the center of rotation making the
circle representing Rabi oscillation smaller for φ = π/2 and larger for φ = −π/2. In Fig. 8 we show how this leads to a shift in
the average (cid:104)σy(cid:105).

FIG. 8. From a bird’s eye-view, we can see that the Rabi
oscillations represented in Fig. 7 cause a movement in the
center of rotation along the y-direction (represented by ∆y in
the ﬁgure). Just as in Fig. 7, we have taken p the same for
both and t1 = π

that the higher order terms do in fact die oﬀ as eAx/∆.

General two-band theory

We now consider the general two-band theory for this
Hall eﬀect. In general, we deﬁne the persistent Hall re-
sponse as the antisymmetric part of the tensor Σ∞µν that
is obtained from

J∞µ = Σ∞µνAν + O(A2).

(72)

Since we are working in two-dimensions, this is just a
single value we call Σ∞Hall = Σ∞yx − Σ∞xy.

The general two band model we have in mind is

Without loss of generality, we quench ∆ → 0 at t = 0.
The current operator for such a theory is ∂µh(p, ∆) =
∂µ0(p)I + ∂µd(p, ∆).
First, let us show that ∂µ0(p)I does not contribute
to the Hall conductivity. Considering the state |ψ2(cid:105), the
current after the pulse is

(cid:104)ψ2|∂µ0(p − eA)|ψ2(cid:105) = ∂µ0(p − eA)

(74)
= ∂µ0(p) − eAν∂µ∂ν0(p). (75)
The last term is symmetric in µ and ν and therefore
cannot contribute to a Hall response. Therefore, we only
need to consider ∂µd(p, ∆) · σ for the Hall current.
current at inﬁnite time should be represented by

Taking the view from before, we have simply that the

h(p, ∆) = 0(p)I + d(p, ∆) · σ.

over a period of Larmor precession.
The average is purely determined by the state right
after the pulse (cid:104)ψ1|σ|ψ1(cid:105) which is a point on the Bloch
sphere, and this is determined by the evolution of ˆn =
(cid:104)ψ(t)|σ|ψ(t)(cid:105) in the time frame t ∈ [0, t1). The equation
of motion is

∂t ˆn = 2d(p, 0) × ˆn,

ˆn(t = 0) = −ˆd(p, ∆).

(77)

After the pulse, the new center of rotation is deﬁned

by the vector d(p − eA), and the average is simply
(cid:104)ψ2|σ|ψ2(cid:105) = ˆd(p − eA, 0)[ˆd(p − eA, 0) · ˆn(t1)].
It is then a simple matter to show
j∞µ (p, t1) = −e[ˆd(p − eA, 0) · ˆn(t1)]∂µd(p − eA, 0).

(78)

(79)

The integral of this over the occupied momenta p
will give the total current at inﬁnite-time J∞µ . How-
ever, we are interested in picking out the Hall contribu-
tion. We ﬁnd that if we deﬁne j∞µ (p, t1) ≈ χ∞µν(p, t1)Aν
and χ∞Hall(p, t1) = 1
p χ∞Hall,
ˆd0 = ˆd(p, 0), and ˆd = ˆd(p, ∆), and

2 (χ∞yx − χ∞xy), then Σ∞Hall = (cid:82)

χ∞Hall(p, t1) = e2[∂yd0∂x ˆd0 − ∂xd0∂y ˆd0] · ˆn(t1).

(80)

Condition for no persistent Hall current

We can solve Eq. (77) and obtain

ˆn(t1) = ˆd0(ˆd · ˆd0) − ˆd0 × (ˆd0 × ˆd) cos 2d0t1

− ˆd0 × ˆd sin 2d0t1.
This can be substituted into Eq. (80), and we get

χ∞Hall(p, t1) = e2[∂yd0∂x ˆd0 − ∂xd0∂y ˆd0]

· [ˆd cos 2d0t1 − ˆd0 × ˆd sin 2d0t1].

(81)

(82)

These terms will integrate to zero given some special sym-
metries.

The natural symmetry to consider is time-reversal
Indeed, this helps, but only partially, since

symmetry.
for a time-reversal preserving system, we have

T −1h(−p)T = h(p)

d(−p) · T −1σT = d(p) · σ.

(83)

(84)

As an anti-unitary operator, T = U K where U is a uni-
tary and K is complex conjugation. Complex conjuga-
tion will just let σy → −σy, and U will rotate along
the Bloch sphere. Thus, any sort of triple product will
change sign, and we have

∂xd0[∂y ˆd · (ˆd0 × ˆd)]|p→−p = −∂xd0[∂y ˆd · (ˆd0 × ˆd)].

(85)

13

Naturally d0(−p) = d0(p) as well. Thus, with both mo-
menta connected by time-reversal symmetry, they lie at
the same energy and any integral over a ﬁnite chemical
potential will cancel their contributions.

However, there is still the possibility that the term that

goes as cos 2d0t1 in Eq. (80) will be ﬁnite.

To address this term, if both systems respect a mirror
symmetry (unitary or anti-unitary) along one plane, this
term will also vanish. In particular, let us say the “mirror
plane” is along the x-direction without loss of generality.
Then, deﬁne the mirror symmetry operator My = U K a
(where a = 0 if unitary and a = 1 if anti-unitary) as
acting on H such that

M−1

y h(px,−py)My = h(px, py)
˜Id(px,−py) · σ = d(px, py) · σ,

(86)

(87)

where ˜I is either the identity or an inversion operator on
d. In fact, ˜I should act as the identity on d(px, 0), and so
all d(px, 0) span an invariant subspace for ˜I. Generally
this space will be more than 1 dimensional, and so if it
is two-dimensional (if it is three-dimensional, ˜I will just
be the identity), we have

h(px, 0) = dx(px, 0)σx + dz(px, 0)σz,

(88)

where without loss of generality we chose the x- and z-
directions to be the invariant directions. Thus, we have
dy(px, py) → 0 as py → 0. Furthermore, inversion can
only occur in that direction, so we have
d(px,−py) = (dx(px, py),±dy(px, py), dz(px, py)). (89)
This allows us to say

∂xd0∂y ˆd0 · ˆd|py→−py = −∂xd0∂y ˆd0 · ˆd.

(90)

And by similar reasoning as before, once we integrate
over all momenta, there will be no contribution to the
Hall current.

Thus, we have proved the following statement:

If
h(p, ∆) and h(p, 0) both have time-reversal symmetry
and mirror-symmetry along the same plane, then Σ∞Hall =
0.

Another way to phrase this is:

if h(p, ∆) has mirror
symmetry along some axis for all ∆, then time-reversal
symmetry breaking before and after the quench implies
Σ∞Hall = 0. The models we study are just that: Models
that have such a mirror symmetry.

Relation to Berry curvature

We can now make a more precise claim about the Hall

current’s relation to Berry curvature.

First, we take the equation for Larmor precession

Eq. (77) and rewrite it as

ˆd0 =

ˆn × ∂t ˆn
2d0 − ˆn(ˆd0 · ˆd).

(cid:33)

,

Generically, we will quench from M to M(cid:48) and use
Eq. (30) to determine the long-time persistent response.
The ingredients we need are (1) the ground state of
h(k, M ), (2) the time evolution with the quenched Hamil-
tonian h(k, M(cid:48)), and (3) the eigenstates and energies of
h(k − eA, M(cid:48)).
d · σ, h(k, M(cid:48)) = d0 · σ, and h(k − eA, M(cid:48)) = dA · σ.
We can then write the ground state of h(k, M ) as

We shall denote our resulting d-vectors by h(k, M ) =

(101)

.

(102)

With these ingredients we can solve for the persistent
current for a single momentum k, and then integrate over
the Brillouin zone to obtain the total persistent current.
This procedure can be done easily numerically, and we
obtain what is plotted in Fig. 9 (we restore physical units
in the plot). Notice that we get an eﬀect independent of
what phase we are quenching from or to. For reference,
the phases are trivial for M > 0, −2 < M < 0 is a
topological insulator with σxy = −1, −4 < M < −2 is
a topological insulator with σxy = +1, and M < −4 is
back to a trivial insulator.

ANALOGY WITH MONOPOLES AND DIPOLES

In these models with nontrivial Berry curvature, we
can say that we have monopoles that are sources of
Berry curvature. Naturally extending this, in the Hal-
dane model represented by h = vFk · σ + ∆σz, the (pos-
itively charged) monopole has been lifted above the x-y
plane.

The quenching procedure is then suddenly moving this
charge close to the plane, and the pulse would be a
sudden movement parallel to the plane. Meanwhile the
dipoles, having not relaxed, are rotating around their lo-
cal magnetic ﬁeld – Larmor precessing. The statement
above then becomes that a net magnetization will ap-
pear perpendicular to the last movement. However, the
precession is quite strange: The magnetic ﬁeld strength
(and hence how fast the precession happens) is increased
for states further away from the monopole.

The term that is important for Eq. (80) is

ˆn · ∂µ ˆd0 = ˆn ·

− ∂µ(ˆd0 · ˆd).

(92)

Now, we can write the Berry curvature as Ωµt = 1
(∂µ ˆn × ∂t ˆn), and thus, we have

2 ˆn ·

χ∞Hall(p, t1) = e2{∂y log d0[Ωxt1 − ∂x(ˆd0 · ˆd)]

− ∂x log d0[Ωyt1 − ∂y(ˆd0 · ˆd)]}.

If we assume the system has the mirror-symmetry de-
scribed in the preceding section, then

band, then we can integrate by parts without picking up
boundary terms and we get

(95)

The response of the system is purely described in terms
of a weighted integral over the derivative of the Berry
curvature. This Berry curvature is evaluated for the state
at the time of the pulse.

Full time current response

For completeness, we just mention that if we deﬁne
ˆn2 = (cid:104)ψ2|σ|ψ2(cid:105), we can easily write the expression for
the single particle current response:

jµ(p; t2, t1) = j∞µ (p; t1) + e
where we just deﬁned ˆdA = ˆd(p − eA, 0).

THE TIME-REVERSAL BROKEN BHZ MODEL

Lastly, we consider the time-reversal broken BHZ

model with

where

h(k, M ) = d(k, M ) · σ,

(97)

d(k, M ) = (sin kx, sin ky, M + 2 − cos kx − cos ky).

(98)

This model admits 4 gapped (or ungapped at the phase
transitions) Dirac cones.
In equilibrium, depending on
the sign of the gap at each point (controlled by M ), we
can have a positive, negative or zero Hall conductance
overall.

15

FIG. 9. The long-time ballistic current versus the time of the pulse t1 for the time-reversal-broken BHZ model. Notice how
that depending on when the pulse hits, the ballistic current can be positive or negative. Additionally, the ﬁnite size keeps there
from being a response when t1 → 0+, and there a ‘turn-on’ time for the ballistic current (a time we must wait to get the largest
eﬀect). The pulse used in these ﬁgures is Ax = 0 and eAy = 0.1/a.

This will give us a slightly diﬀerent eﬀect, and we
can easily approach this problem with some of the ge-
ometric machinery we used before. Assume that there
is a monopole at a position z0 above a plane of non-
interacting dipoles, then the dipoles will align themselves
with the monopole such that at position r = (x, y)

M y =

(103)

The charge from the monopole is spherically symmetric,
but we will not specify how it depends on the distance
yet

B(r) = B(r)ˆr.

(104)

The monopole begins with B(r−z0ˆz). Then, we suddenly
shift the monopole down in plane. Each dipole feels mag-
netic ﬁeld from the monopole and rotates as described by
the equation of motion

In fact, we can write

r + z0[cos B(r)t ˆz + sin B(r)t (ˆz × ˆr)]

M = −µ

(105)

.

(106)

Then at t = t1, we suddenly shift the monopole in the
x-direction by an amount x1, and we use the formula to
determine how much the center of rotation is along the

Now, assume the dipoles have a density ρ on the xy-
plane, when we integrate this function over the plane,
we can break it into polar coordinates, but notice that
the only nonzero term will be the term which goes as
sin B(r)t1 above (everything else is odd in terms of y
and can be safely discarded).

Therefore, our total magnetization that dynamically
appears perpendicular to the shift in the monopole, M∞y ,
