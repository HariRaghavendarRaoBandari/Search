Recent results in deeply subwavelength thickness ﬁlms demonstrated coherent control and logical
gate operations with both classical and single photon light sources. However, quantum processing
and devices typically involve more than one photon and non-trivial input quantum states. Here
we experimentally investigate two-photon N00N state coherent absorption in a multilayer graphene
ﬁlm. Depending on the N00N state input phase, it is possible to selectively choose between single
or two photon absorption of the input state in the graphene ﬁlm. These results demonstrate that
coherent absorption in the quantum regime exhibits unique features opening up applications in
multiphoton spectroscopy and imaging.

Introduction: Coherent absorption is the process by
which a partially absorbing material placed in a stand-
ing wave pattern can either perfectly transmit or absorb
all of the incoming light. This process occurs as a result
of the coherent interaction and of the relative phase re-
lation of the two counter-propagating waves. Originally
demonstrated in thick slabs of material where the pro-
cess was likened to a “time-reversed laser” [1, 2]. Coher-
ent absorption was recently extended to deeply subwave-
length thickness (2D) materials that have 50% absorption
[3, 4, 6]. Depending on the relative phase of the incident
beams, it is possible to totally absorb (or transmit) light,
thus providing a method to go beyond the theoretical
limit of 50% absorption in a thin ﬁlm [5], and therefore
provide a route to obtain optical gates that rely on ab-
sorption [7]. This process relies heavily on the relations
between reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients, r and t,
and absorption rate, α, of the sample[8]. A special case is
found for a sub-wavelength material exhibiting precisely
50% absorption, where complete absorption (or transmis-
sion) of the energy of the two beams is possible as a result
of the relation between reﬂection and transmission coef-
ﬁcients being forced to r = ±t [5]. This has been shown
experimentally with classical continuous wave sources [6],
ultrashort pulses [9], and has also been extended to the
nonlinear regime to achieve coherent control of nonlinear
wave-mixing processes [10]. However, only a few studies
have looked at the quantum nature of coherent absorp-
tion.
Recent experimental work has shown that a single pho-
ton also exhibits coherent perfect absorption [11, 12],
thus implying for example, deterministic absorption of
the single photon itself.
More intriguing results are expected when non-trivial
quantum states interact with a lossy beamsplitter. An
N=2 N00N state, (|N, 0(cid:105) + eiN φ|0, N(cid:105))/
2 (obtained as

√

the superposition of having N photons in one arm of an
interferometer and none in the other) incident on a 50%
absorbing beamsplitter results in states that can be com-
posed of either single photons or a mixture of N-photon
states (see Table 1) [8]. Despite these theoretical predic-
tions, this work is the ﬁrst reported experiment investi-
gating the coherent absorption of N00N states.
Here we show for an input N=2 N00N state that control-
ling the relative phases of the two arms of an interferom-
eter allows us to either deterministically absorb only one
photon or produce a mixed state which exhibits nonlin-
ear absorption of two photons.
A Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer is used to cre-
ate the N00N states that are then used as the input
to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The output
beamsplitter of the MZI is a ∼ 50% absorbing multi-
layer graphene ﬁlm. To explain the quantum coherent
absorption process at the graphene beamsplitter, we ﬁrst
describe a theoretical model and then compare experi-
mental results with N00N states incident on to a lossless
and to a graphene beamsplitter.
Theoretical overview: The output states for a generic
lossy beamsplitter (see inset to Fig. 1) are related to the
input states by,

ˆaout = tˆain + rˆbin + ˆfa
ˆbout = tˆbin + rˆain + ˆfb

(1)

where r is the reﬂection coeﬃcient, t is the transmission
coeﬃcient, and ˆfa,b are the noise operators [13]. The
noise operators are necessary to preserve the commuta-
tors of the observable outputs for a generic beamsplitter
which may exhibit loss or gain.
In the case of a lossy
beamsplitter we have |t ± r| < 1 and the noise operators
account for this loss.

We consider a special case of lossy beamsplitter, with

absorption A = 0.5. This restriction forces the relation
between reﬂected and transmitted waves to r = ±t =
±0.5 and therefore the phase diﬀerence between trans-
mitted and reﬂected beams is restricted to θ = 0 or θ = π
[5]. We consider the beamsplitter as shown in the inset
to Fig. 1 with 50% absorption, to which we input the

superposition modes, |2+(cid:105) = (|2a, 0b(cid:105) + |0a, 2b(cid:105))/(cid:112)(2) or
|2−(cid:105) = (|2a, 0b(cid:105)−|0a, 2b(cid:105))/(cid:112)(2). The output states for a

50%-loss beamsplitter have been derived in Ref.
[8] and
are summarised in Table I. In row 1 we see that for a |2+(cid:105)
input state either both photons survive interaction with
the sample or both photons are absorbed (by the noise
operator, ˆf ). Remarkably, this implies that the sam-
ple exhibits pure two-photon absorption, a process that
typically occurs only in the nonlinear (i.e. high beam
intensity) regime but here arises as a result of coherent
absorption acting upon a speciﬁc quantum photon state.
On the other hand, for a |2−(cid:105) input state, one photon of
each pair is always absorbed, hence the output is a su-
perposition of one-photon states that must contain only
one photon.
For a lossy splitter with r (cid:54)= t, the phase relations deviate
from the ideal case described above. This has the eﬀect
of mixing the output modes, which means that there will
be zero-, one- and two-photon components at the output,
with ratios determined non-trivially by the relevant com-
binations of the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients.
In real experiments, this implies that we will eﬀectively
reduce the purity of the single and two-photon absorp-
tion processes.
To complete the picture we also include in Table I (third
and fourth rows) the results for the lossless case where
t = ir i.e. φ = π/2 (where φ is the input phase), as
demonstrated in a cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferome-
ter [14]. We see that depending on the input phase, the
bi-photons either bunch together or split apart, therefore
conserving total photon number, as should be expected
when the noise operators are removed.

Experiments: We use a frequency tripled Nd:YAG
laser producing >15 ps pulses centred at λ = 355 nm at
a repetition rate of 120 MHz (downsampled to 60 MHz),
to pump a type 1 β-barium-borate (β-BBO) crystal and

FIG. 1: Experimental layout. A frequency tripled Nd:YAG
laser is used to pump a type 1 BBO crystal producing corre-
lated biphotons. The biphotons (P1, P2) are separated by a
knife-edge prism (KEP) and coupled to single-mode polarisa-
tion maintaining ﬁbers. One of the ﬁber couplers is mounted
on a translation stage in order to control the relative delay
between the two photons. The photons are recombined on a
50:50 ﬁber beamsplitter BS1 within their coherence length in
order to produce bunched photon pairs which exit the beam-
splitter in the quantum state |2, 0(cid:105)−e2iφ|0, 2(cid:105). The phase φ of
the quantum state is tuned by a mirror mounted to a piezo-
electrically transduced stage. The quantum state is combined
once again onto a second beamsplitter BS2, which is either a
lossless 50:50 beamsplitter or an absorptive graphene beam-
splitter. The output states from the second beamsplitter are
measured with 4 single-photon avalanche dioides (SPADs),
A, B, C and D after two further 50:50 beamsplitters, BS3
and BS4. The inset shows a schematic drawing of the out-
put beamsplitter BS2 with the input and output states, as
referred to in the text.

create correlated single photon pairs with a central wave-
length λ = 710 nm. The photon pairs are separated in
the far ﬁeld and collected with polarisation maintainin-
ing ﬁbers. These ﬁbers are combined onto a lossless 50:50
beamsplitter BS1 (the ﬁrst BS in our Mach-Zehnder in-
terferometer, see Fig. 1). A controllable delay on one of
the input arms to BS1 controls the path length diﬀer-
ence between the two arms, which is optimised so that
the photons bunch as shown in the famous experiment
of Hong, Ou and Mandel [15]. The bunched biphotons
serve as the input to the second beamsplitter BS2, which
corresponds to the device shown in the inset to Fig. 1.
BS2 is either (i) an absorptive graphene ﬁlm or (ii) a loss-
less 50:50 beamsplitter. The multilayer graphene sample
is grown by chemical vapour deposition from Graphene
Platform with approximately 40 layers of graphene on
a substrate of fused silica. This provides an absorption
of ∼ 61% and reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients of
r = 0.30 and t = 0.55 respectively.
A piezo-electric
stage on one of the interferometer mirrors controls the
phase of the N00N states incident on BS2. The pho-
tons in each of the output ports of BS2 are split once
again in the two 50:50 beamsplitters, BS3 and BS4, re-

and D. The output photons are detected with single pho-
ton avalanche detectors (SPADs) connected to a Pico-
Quant Hydra Harp 400 detection card allowing time-
tagged events to be recorded. Measurements are per-
formed in time-tagged time-resolved mode such that the
coincident photon events can subsequently be analysed
in multiple conﬁgurations (AB, AC, ..., CD). We set the
coincidence time window to ∆τ = 25 ns. A complete set
of coincidence measurements are taken as a function of
the interferometer phase across all four detection ports.
Results: Figures 2 and 3 show the results for the cases
of the lossless and graphene (lossy) beamsplitter, respec-
tively. Both ﬁgures show examples of raw coincidence
count data (a), and the Fourier transforms of the data
(b). The latter highlights the oscillation in the coin-
cidences at twice the frequency of the single detector
counts, as expected with input N00N states. We then
isolate the N00N state contribution by multiplying the
data by a Gaussian-shaped ﬁlter [black dashed line in
(b)] and inverse Fourier transforming so as to obtain the
curves in (c). The curves in Figures 2(c) and 3(c) show
the N00N coincidence counts across all detector pairings,
as indicated in the ﬁgures. We underline the main dif-
ference between the lossless and graphene beamsplitter
measurements: whilst in the lossless case the coincidence
counts corresponding to detectors located on opposite

The slight phase shift seen here is due to the asymmetry of

sides of the beamsplitter (AC, AD, BC, BD) are out of
phase with those from detectors on the same side (AB
and CD), in the graphene case all pairings oscillate in
phase. This is in agreement with the theoretical predic-
tions summarised in Table I and is a clear indication of
the action of loss on the input N00N states. Indeed, for
an input |2+(cid:105) state we predict and observe an equal prob-
ability of coincidences being measured between same-side
and opposing-side detection ports. Therefore all detector
pairs see a maximum. For the |2−(cid:105) input state, a single
photon is absorbed so that it is not possible to measure
a coincidence between any of the detection ports, and as
a result we see a minimum for all detector pairs. This
is the key observation that lies at the heart of the very
peculiar features of coherent absorption of N00N states.
An alternative way of viewing this data is provided in
Fig. 4 that shows the sum of the coincidences measured
across all 6 detection pairs (2AB+AC +AD+BC +BD+
2CD) as a function of the interferometer mirror position
∆x2 for three cases. We note that when adding the co-
incidence counts together, it is necessary to multiply the
same side coincidence counts AB and CD by a factor of
2 in order to account for the fact that 50% of the time,
two photons incident on the output beamsplitter (BS3 or
BS4) will bunch together and therefore be recorded as a

absorbed or two photons are absorbed. The fact that
a two-photon state may exhibit full two-photon absorp-
tion alone (i.e. with no single-photon absorption) is a
purely quantum eﬀect and is in itself rather remarkable.
In a certain sense our work is reminiscent of two-photon
absorption processes in nonlinear optics yet here, all pro-
cesses are inherently linear. Loss is usually highly detri-
mental to quantum states but may also be envisaged as a
resource for quantum photonics and applications involv-
ing for example N00N states in quantum metrology [16–
19] and the ability to control single versus two-photon
absorption may be used to selectively isolate single and
two-photon processes in individual molecules or quantum
dots [20].

blue curve is a ﬁt to the oscillation at frequency k2. In (iii)
the minima and maxima are related to a switching between
input photon states |2+(cid:105) and |2−(cid:105), respectively, and therefore
to switching in the output states from single to two photon
absorption.

single click at a single detector. For the case where there
is no beamsplitter or a lossless beamsplitter (solid black
and dashed purple curve in Fig. 4, respectively), there is
no change in the coincidence counts with interferometer
mirror position, as expected. What we measure is merely
a re-distribution of the photons within the system that
is controlled by the relative lengths of the interferometer
arms. The slight reduction in total coincidence rate with
respect to the ‘no beam-splitter’ case is accounted for by
a small amount of loss inherent in the beamsplitter. Con-
versely, in the case of the graphene beamsplitter, we see
an oscillation of the total coincidence rate as a function
of the interferometer phase. This is due to the change in
the total energy within the system as predicted also by
the quantum states in Table I. We note that the mod-
ulation depth is reduced with respect to the ideal case,
which we ascribe to the non-ideal (> 50%) absorption of
our beamsplitter. However, the main traits summarised
in Table I are still clearly visible: as the input states
are changed from |2−(cid:105) to |2+(cid:105), we transition from an in-
creased likelihood of single-poton to two-photon absorp-
tion, respectively.
Conclusions: We show coherent ab-
sorption of N00N states on a lossy beamsplitter exhibits
very distinct features compared to single photon or clas-
sical beam coherent absorption. If the lossy beamsplitter
absorbs 50%, then single photon states can be either com-
pletely absorbed or transmitted. Conversely, with input
two-photon N00N states by varying the input states we
can selectively control whether only a single photon is
