Over the last several decades it has been increasingly recognized that stochastic processes play
a central role in transcription. Though many stochastic eﬀects have been explained, the source of
transcriptional bursting (one of the most well-known sources of stochasticity) has continued to evade
understanding. Recent results have pointed to mechanical feedback as the source of transcriptional
bursting but a reconciliation of this perspective with preexisting views of transcriptional regulation
is lacking. In this letter we present a simple phenomenological model which is able to incorporate
the traditional view of gene expression within a framework with mechanical limits to transcription.
Our model explains the emergence of universal properties of gene expression, wherein the lower limit
of intrinsic noise necessarily rises with mean expression level.

The ability to watch biological phenomena play out
at the single molecule level has revealed a rich and nu-
anced view of the central dogma of biology. From the
single molecule vantage it has become clear that random
forces and events play a key role in transcription [1]. The
identiﬁcation of transcriptional bursting, in which genes
undergo periods of paused activity even in fully induced
environments [2], has been one of the most notable ex-
amples of this new perspective. Bursting has also ﬁgured
prominently in the discussion concerning universal prop-
erties of transcriptional noise [3]. In particular, a number
of recent experimental results have found that there is a
link between the rate and randomness of mRNA produc-
tion where highly expressed genes have increased noise
associated with production [3]. This result transcends
speciﬁc organisms or genes, and may be explained if ex-
pression inevitably exhibits bursting. Other work, how-
ever, has argued that under some conditions there are
non-universal gene speciﬁc relationships between the rate
and randomness of mRNA production [4]; these results
are more consistent with the pure model of transcription
regulated by the binding of speciﬁc regulatory proteins
to the promoter regions, in which high expression is not
necessarily associated with high noise.

What is needed is a framework which is able to ac-
commodate both the traditional ‘promoter architecture’
view of transcription while at the same time capturing re-
cently observed universal aspects of bursting. To accom-
plish this, we start from the “twin-supercoiling domain”
[5] model of transcription wherein the helical nature of
DNA combined with topological obstructions leads to
the accumulation of mechanical strain in DNA during
transcription. This strain can result in arrested gene ex-
pression. Speciﬁc biological machinery (topoisomerases)

must relieve the strain created by transcription through
physical, topological manipulation of the DNA in order
for gene expression to continue. A recent study has shed
further light on these mechanical aspects of transcrip-
tion covering both the physical range and speed at which
RNA polymerase (RNAP) can operate [6]. Additionally
the self-induced stalling and topoisomerase mediated re-
covery of RNAP during transcription in bacteria [7] has
been observed in real-time, highlighting the intrinsic role
of super-coiling and mechanics in gene expression at the

of transcripts mc being made (and a corresponding me-
chanical state of the DNA begin reached) (depicted in
Fig.1). Relaxation events occur with rate g, relieving
all mechanical strain in the DNA and erasing the gene’s
knowledge of previous transcripts made. A pivotal as-
sumption is that for each transcription event m → m + 1
the internal mechanical strain of the DNA increases by
some amount which must be removed by a subsequent
relaxation event. This makes the non-equilibrium cycle
of frustration and relaxation a fundamental part of tran-
scription. We ﬁrst examine the simpler case of pure me-
chanical regulation before incorporating this mechanism
into a standard repressor regulatory scheme.

The most natural mathematical framework in which
to incorporate all the elements described above is the
master equation through which stationary expressions
for the mean and variance of mRNA levels can all be
analytically derived (see supplementary material for de-
tails). As a transcript is made both the number of tran-
scripts present, m, as well the internal strain of the sys-
tem Pα(m) → Pα+1(m + 1) increase, where α denotes
the number of transcripts made since the last relaxation
event. At the cutoﬀ, α = mc, transcription stalls until a
relaxation event resets the system to α = 0. The proba-
bility of ﬁnding m mRNAs is the sum over each internal
α Pα(m). The moments of
this probability distribution are most easily obtained by
introducing a generating function Gα for each Pα. By
doing this the equation for the total generating function
α Gα(z) only depends on the arrested state,

mechanical state P (m) = (cid:80)
G(z) = (cid:80)

viz.,

˙G = λ(1 − z)∂zG + r(z − 1)(G − Gmc)

(1)

By setting ˙G = 0 and taking various partial derivatives of
G we can calculate the stationary moments of the mRNA
levels. The only challenge exists in calculating Pmc and
mmc the probability of being in the arrested state and
the expected number of mRNA given that the system is
in the arrested state, respectively. Both can be obtained
analytically and yield an occupational probability and
mean mRNA expression level which are non-linear in the
transcriptional and relaxation rates

One simple limit is where transcription occurs very
quickly compared to the other time-scales. One can treat
this case as a simple process of making a burst of mc tran-
scripts at rate g, plus mRNA decay at rate λ. This leads
to the mRNA level becoming independent of the tran-
scriptional rate, m → mc
g
λ . Similarly, the noise in this
limit, as captured by the Fano factor F = variance(m)
, is
mean(m)
dependent only on the cutoﬀ value, F → 1+mc
. In gen-
eral, the expression for the Fano factor is complicated,
and is given in the SM.

single transcript level.

Such a mechanically based regulatory scheme acts not
independently of, but instead underneath, well-known bi-
ological regulatory agents, calling for an extension of the
standard view of gene regulation. We believe that this
perspective is crucial since mechanical silencing requires
transcription so that in systems with mechanical stalling
the rate of mechanical arrest is fundamentally tied to the
rate of mRNA production.

A simple way to incorporate the points outlined above
is the introduction of a hard limit to the number of tran-
scripts any particular gene is able to make before expres-
sion arrests and must thereafter wait for a randomly oc-
curring relaxation event before it can resume. We there-
fore propose the following stochastic model. Each mRNA
transcript is made with rate r and decays independently
with rate λ . The rate of mRNA production r reﬂects
the ability of a particular gene to promote transcription.
As each mRNA is made the mechanical strain inside the
DNA is increased until RNAP can no longer operate,
which corresponds to a deterministic maximum number

The relationship between mean and noise levels as a
function of promoter strength r for various cutoﬀ values
at ﬁxed relaxation rate g is shown by the curves in Fig-
ure 2a with the red dots showing the linear dependence in
the large r limit. Of course, at small r the system never
reaches the cutoﬀ state and the process is purely Poisso-
nian, with F = 1. The Fano factor begins to rise towards
the aforementioned asymptotic value when the time to
mechanical frustration becomes comparable to the time
(cid:38) g. A useful approximation to
of relaxation, so that r

the curve can be obtained by going to the limit of large
r, large mc, keeping the ratio x = r

This result, which incorporates the above large r limit,
illustrates how a mechanical limit to transcription pro-
vides a natural mechanism for bounding from below the
intrinsic noise at a given mean expression level and thus
demonstrates how mechanical regulation provides an ex-
planation of this universal property of gene expression
noise.

To see how large-scale transcriptional data might ap-
pear when diﬀerent genes are characterized by a spec-

trum of rates as might exist in real organisms, we have
taken the analytical expressions for the mean mRNA
levels and Fano factors and generated theoretical data
clouds by varying transcriptional production and decay
rates r, λ, all for diﬀerent cutoﬀ levels mc, in Figure 2b.
A change in the mechanical barrier through the cutoﬀ
value mc postpones the rise in the Fano factor to larger
mean expression level, and so decreases the lower bound
of the cloud. At the same time, it increases the maximum
Fano factor. We see that the presented clouds show that
the minimum Fano factor increases with increasing mean
expression. Thus, the introduction of mechanical limi-
tations to transcription provides an explanation for the
previously unexplained high noise - high mean proper-
ties of gene expression [3, 8] and clearly illustrates how
macroscopic bounds of gene expression data might arise.
Increasing the cutoﬀ value mc or increasing the rate of
mechanical relaxation decreases the lower bound on tran-
scriptional noise and oﬀers a plausible explanation for
recent observations of weak noise for constitutively tran-
scribed genes [4]. A fuller understanding of the mechan-
ical properties of any particular gene is needed to make
more direct comparisons.

Most genes are subject to regulation by proteins that
couple to DNA and aﬀect RNAP recruitment. For con-
creteness, we will focus on the case of a repressor. To in-

4

clude well-known repressor eﬀects, we simply posit that
the production of mRNA will be paused while the gene
is repressed. We introduce a hypothetical repressor with
binding/unbinding rates k± corresponding to states in
which the previously described mechanical process is ac-
tive (repressor unbound) or paused (repressor bound).
While active, the gene is governed by the same underly-
ing mechanical process as previously described; and since
the promoter-based silencing is independent of the topoi-
somerase action, we will allow for relaxation events to
take place for both active and repressed genes.

Using the same master equation approach as in the
unregulated case we can derive analytical results for the
stationary mRNA mean level

In the limit where the mRNA production rate r is

for the stationary mean which is r independent m →

level. For repressor dynamics which is much slower than
the relaxation rate, k± (cid:28) g, we have

This formula is very instructive. The Fano factor is com-
posed of two contributions. The ﬁrst is that due to
the mechanical relaxation alone. The second is exactly
the Fano factor for the pure regulatory dynamics, with
(r/λ)Pon replaced by (gmc/λ)Pon, which is the mean ex-
pression level at large r in the presence of mechanical
regulation. In particular, the formula illustrates how the
noise can be very large if k+ > k− and g > λ, explain-
ing points in the data which are much greater than the
noise bound set by mechanical regulation. As expected,
the repressor diminishes the mean level of expression and
also has signiﬁcant eﬀects on the intrinsic noise.

In addition to changing expression levels by varying
r, we can vary the repressor binding/unbinding rate k±
ratio for the case of a repressed gene. Interestingly, the
noise/mean curves for a repressed gene show decreased
noise (at a ﬁxed mean) with mechanical governance as
opposed to a non-mechanical repressed gene, as this ratio
is varied (see Fig. S5). The noise/mean relationship
for varying repressor kinetics produces curves similar to
those seen in recent experiments [4].

We can again explore all possible noise/mean relation-
ships for a multitude of hypothetical genes faced with
mechanical limits and make a direct comparison to pre-
viously published universal gene expression noise/mean

data [3]. The theoretical data points in Figure 3 repre-
sent mean/noise values for mRNA being produced and
decaying for a variety of rates r, k± at ﬁxed relaxation
and decay g, λ. The signature rise in the lower bound
of the noise with increased expression that we encoun-
tered for non-repressed genes is preserved and it is again
shifted by changing the mechanical barrier through the
cutoﬀ value mc. This is most clearly illustrated by con-
trasting the colored points of Figure 3, which are sub-
ject to mechanical limits, to the black points which are
not. The introduction of a mechanical limit to transcrip-
tion naturally generates previously unexplained bounds
to the mean and intrinsic noise found in experimental
data [3, 8].

Beyond noise/mean statistical data, wait-time distri-
butions for periods of activity and inactivity, as well as
the burst-size distributions for the number of mRNA
made in-between arrests, can shed light on the nature
of the arrest process. We operationally deﬁned bursts
as periods without mRNA production lasting more than
a time 2
λ while wait-times represent the time to reach
the arrested state from the completely relaxed state. In
the case where r (cid:29) g, the gene never relaxes before ar-
resting and the wait-time distributions have short-time
peaks (see solid curves in Figure 4a) but exponential

long-time behavior as well as a simple burst-size distri-
bution where the maximum number of transcripts mc are
typically made between arrests (see purple histogram of
Figure 4b). However, when the transcription rate is more
comparable to relaxation, the peaks of the wait-time dis-
tributions become broadened and the distributions show
strong exponential behavior (see dashed curves in Fig-
ure 4a). Additionally, for slowly arresting genes, a much
broader burst-size distribution, where often many more
than mc transcripts are made in between arrest events,
is observed (see blue histogram of Figure 4b) showing a
strong resemblance to a geometric distribution.

It is worth noting that the true nature of the mechani-
cal arrest problem, which takes into account the physical
drag and energy associated with the act of transcription
as well as the precise action of the topoisomerases, is
not addressed in detail within this letter. However, the
simple phenomenological model presented here is a ﬁrst
attempt at putting together the necessary ingredients for
understanding this more detailed problem and appears to
capture several essential features of transcriptional noise.
As a way of including a more nuanced arrest mechanism
we have conducted numerical simulations (shown in Fig-
ure 7 as points) for a gene which experiences decreased
proclivity for expression as the cutoﬀ mc is approached
and found that only slight quantitative changes occurred
(see S.M. for details). We expect further theoretical and
experimental work on the role mechanical eﬀects play in
gene expression to reﬁne, but not signiﬁcantly change,
the perspective presented here.

Finally, the theoretical discussion within this letter has
not centered on any particular organism. There is no rea-
son to believe that the framework constructed here is not
capable of capturing the same phenomena in many or-
ganisms, oﬀering an explanation for the noise/mean rela-
tionship observed in both bacteria and higher organisms
[3]. Though the most direct evidence for transcriptional
bursting and supercoiling based arrest exists in bacte-
rial systems, the ﬁrst discovery of topoisomerases and
transcription induced supercoiling was done in eukary-
otes [9]. Additionally in yeast it has been demonstrated
that transcription can occur without topoisomerases [9]
possibly due to reduced chromosome organization [10].
Thus mechanically induced stalling provides a mecha-
nism through which previously unexplained mean and
noise bounds in transcriptional data across many organ-
isms [3] can be reconciled with the prevailing ’promoter
architecture’ view of transcription.

In conclusion the results of this letter are the ﬁrst
steps in combining the traditional view of transcriptional
regulation with recent discoveries concerning the role of
stochasticity and mechanics. The reconciliation of these
two perspectives, even at the simple level presented here,
is key to resolving outstanding puzzles in gene expression
and allowing for a more complete view of transcription
to emerge.

We are going to construct a master equation for the state probabilities Pα(m), α = 0, 1, . . . , mc, m = 0, 1, . . ..
The state space and transitions are illustrated in Fig. 7. From this, we obtain equations for the generating function
m zmPα(m, t). From the Gα we can construct the entire generating function as
m zmP (m, t) where P (m, t) is the probability of m mRNAs, traced over
the mechanical states α. We will proceed by writing down three separate master equations which correspond to the
three distinct types of states in the system and for each, transform them into equations for the respective generating
functions from which we can calculate the zeroth moments (traced over m, for a given α), namely Pα.

Slowed Transcription

Within the basic phenomenological model outlined here there are a number of simpliﬁcations which we have em-
ployed that are worth addressing, most notably the nature of the mechanical arrest and relaxation processes. In our
simpliﬁed model the production of any given mRNA adds the same mechanical strain to the system and each occurs
with the same random rate r up to the cutoﬀ mc. This choice has support from experimental data [2] showing that
the time to transcribe a burst of N transcripts is the same as the time to transcribe N transcripts independently.
Additionally, the RNAP machinery velocity remains fairly constant as it approaches its maximum operating load [6].
Nonetheless, it is certainly worth considering a more nuanced view of the arrest process in which there is a slowing
associated with RNA production in a strained but not stalled gene. We have conducted numerical simulations (shown
in Figure 7 as points) for a gene which experiences decreased proclivity for expression as the cutoﬀ mc is approached
through a decreased mRNA production rate reﬀ = r/(1 + α) where r is the baseline rate and α is the number of
transcripts made since the last relaxation event. The introduction of this slowing eﬀect does not lead to qualitative
changes in our ﬁndings; only minor quantitative diﬀerences are seen in the numerical results as compared to the
analytical expressions from the simpler model.

We now repeat the same formulation but incorporate a suppressed state by constructing a generating function for
m zmQα(m, t) each of which
corresponds again to a given DNA mechanical state α. Again we will write the master equations for each distinctive

This illustrates how noise much greater than the lower bound set by the mechanical limit can exist for various repressor
kinetics.

In Fig. 9 we show curves demonstrating mean/Fano relationships for varying binding kinetics k±.

Wait-Time Distributions

Here we calculate the wait-time distributions for the probability of taking time t to reach the arrested state from
the relaxed state. The problem is taken as a ﬁrst passage time problem with an absorbing boundary at the arrested
state.

We’ll only need the transitions between the states and have no need to incorporate RNA production/degradation

thus we’ll be interested in the master equation dynamics of the states by themselves

i=0

∂tP0 = −(r + g + k)Po + g
∂tPi = −(r + g + k)Pi + rPi−1

Taking the Laplace transform yields

˜P0(s) =

FIG. 9: Each solid curve corresponds to varying a single parameter r (orange), repressor binding k+(blue) and unbinding
k−(purple) while holding the others ﬁxed with mechanical limitation to transcription (with mc = 6, λ = 1
20 ). The dashed
lines show the same without mechanical governance (mc → ∞).
It is interesting to note that the incorporation of the
mechanical limitation does not qualitatively alter the repressor binding/unbinding curves but instead diminished the overall
level of expression and noise. The promoter strength r parameterized behavior for a mechanically limited gene is however
qualitatively changed showing a non-linear increased noise/mean relationship compared to the gene with a repressor only.
