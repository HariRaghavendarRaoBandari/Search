LOEWNER EVOLUTION OF HEDGEHOGS AND 2-CONFORMAL

MEASURES OF CIRCLE MAPS

KINGSHOOK BISWAS

Abstract. Let f be a germ of holomorphic diﬀeomorphism with an irra-
f (0) = 0, f ′(0) =
tionally indiﬀerent ﬁxed point at the origin in C (i.e.
e2πiα, α ∈ R − Q). Perez-Marco (Fixed points and circle maps, Acta Math.
179 (2) 1997, 243-294) showed the existence of a unique continuous monotone
one-parameter family of nontrivial invariant full continua containing the ﬁxed
point called Siegel compacta, and gave a correspondence between germs and
families (gt) of circle maps obtained by conformally mapping the complement
of these compacts to the complement of the unit disk. The family of circle
maps (gt) is the orbit of a locally-deﬁned semigroup (Φt) on the space of ana-
lytic circle maps which we show has a well-deﬁned inﬁnitesimal generator X.
The explicit form of X is obtained by using the Loewner equation associated
to the family of hulls (Kt). We show that the Loewner measures (µt) driv-
ing the equation are 2-conformal measures on the circle for the circle maps
(z 7→ gt(z)).

1. Introduction

A germ f (z) = e2πiαz + O(z2), α ∈ R − Q/Z of holomorphic diﬀeomorphism
ﬁxing the origin in C is said to be linearizable if it is analytically conjugate to the
rigid rotation Rα(z) = e2πiαz. The number α is called the rotation number of f , and
the maximal domain of linearization is called the Siegel disk of f . The linearizability
of f is dependent on the arithmetic of α, and the optimal arithmetic condition
for linearizability in this setting is given by the well-known Brjuno condition (see
[Sie42], [Brj71], [Yoc95]).

Perez-Marco proved the existence of a unique, strictly increasing Hausdorﬀ con-
tinuous family (Kt)t>0 of non-trivial invariant full continua containing the ﬁxed
point called Siegel compacts ([PM97]), where Kt → {0} as t → 0, and Kt can
be described as the connected component containing the origin of the set of non-
escaping points in the closed disc Dt of radius t around the origin. When f is
non-linearizable these are called hedgehogs. The topology and dynamics of hedge-
hogs has been studied by Perez-Marco ([PM94], [PM96]), who also developed tech-
niques using ”tube-log Riemann surfaces” ([BPM15a], [BPM15b], [BPM13]) for the
construction of interesting examples [PM93], [PM95], [PM00] of indiﬀerent germs
and hedgehogs, which were also used by the author ([Bis05], [Bis08], [Bis15]) and
Cheritat ([Che11]) to construct further examples.
Notation: Throughout D∞ will denote the complement in ˆC of the closed unit
disk, D∞ = ˆC − D, r : S1 → S1 will denote complex conjugation, r(ξ) = ξ, and d+
dt
will denote right-hand derivative.

The construction of Perez-Marco from [PM97] associates to a pair (f, K) an
analytic circle diﬀeomorphism g, where f is a germ with an irrationally indiﬀerent
ﬁxed point at the origin and K is a Siegel compact of f , by considering a conformal
map ψ from the complement of K to the complement of the closed unit disk,
ψ : ˆC − K → D∞, such that ψ(∞) = ∞. Conjugating f by ψ gives a holomorphic
diﬀeomorphism g = ψ ◦ f ◦ ψ−1 in an annulus in D∞ having S1 as a boundary
component, and g is shown to extend across S1 to an analytic circle diﬀeomorphism
deﬁned in a neighbourhood of S1 such that the rotation numbers of g and f are
equal, ρ(g) = ρ(f ) = α.

Invariant compacts for g containing S1 then correspond to invariant compacts
for f containing K, and the theorem on existence and uniqueness of Siegel com-
pacts then gives the existence and uniqueness of a continuous strictly increasing 1-
parameter family of Herman compacts (At)0≤t<ǫ for the circle map g with A0 = S1,
where a Herman compact for g is a connected totally invariant compact A contain-
ing S1 such that ˆC− A has two components (such a compact is necessarily invariant
under reﬂection in the unit circle as well). The construction which produces g from
the pair (f, K) can similarly be applied to each pair (g, At) to give a one-parameter
family of analytic circle diﬀeomorphisms (gt)t≥0 with g0 = g, by conjugating g by a
conformal map ψt : ˆC−(D∪At) → D∞, normalized so that ψt(∞) = ∞, ψ′
t(∞) > 0.
As before the map gt = ψt ◦ g ◦ ψ−1
deﬁned in a one-sided neighbourhood of S1
extends across to give an analytic circle diﬀeomorphism gt with rotation number
equal to that of g.

t

The family At being Hausdorﬀ continuous and strictly increasing, it is possible
to reparametrize the family so that the compacts D ∪ At have logarithmic capacity
t, meaning that the expansion of ψt near z = ∞ is of the form

ψt(z) = e−tz + a0(t) +

a1(t)

z

+ . . .

Let Diﬀω(S1) and Diﬀω
α(S1) denote the space of analytic circle diﬀeomorphisms and
the subspace of those diﬀeomorphisms with ﬁxed rotation number α ∈ (R − Q)/Z
respectively. We obtain for t ≥ 0 a locally deﬁned family of maps Φt : Dt ⊂
Diﬀω
α(S1) mapping a circle map g to the circle map gt obtained from
the above construction. Here the domain Dt of Φt consists of those circle maps in

α(S1) → Diﬀω

LOEWNER EVOLUTION OF HEDGEHOGS AND 2-CONFORMAL MEASURES OF CIRCLE MAPS3

Diﬀω
α(S1) which have a Herman compact A such that D∪A has logarithmic capacity
t. It is not hard to show that in fact the maps Φt form a continuous semigroup,
namely Φ0 = id,

Φs ◦ Φt = Φs+t

whenever the composition is deﬁned, and the orbits t 7→ Φt(g) give continuous
curves in Diﬀω

α(S1).

We show in fact that the semigroup (Φt)t≥0 has an inﬁnitesimal generator X,

meaning the curves t 7→ Φt(g) are right-hand diﬀerentiable in t and

d+
dt

Φt(g) = X(Φt(g))

Since the space Diﬀω
α(S1) does not carry any obvious diﬀerentiable structure, the
sense in which these assertions hold is made precise in the statements of the theo-
rems below.

The form of the inﬁnitesimal generator X is obtained by studying the Loewner
equation associated to the family of hulls D ∪ At (we recall in section 2 the basic
facts about the Loewner equation which we will be needing). The maps φt := ψ−1
:
D∞ → ˆC − (D ∪ At) form a Loewner chain, and it is known that t 7→ φt(z, t) is
absolutely continuous for each ﬁxed z ∈ D∞. Moreover, for almost every t, the
right-hand derivatives

t

χt(z) =

d+
ds |s=t

(φ−1

◦ φs)(z)

exist and the functions Ht(z) = χt(z)/z are given by the Herglotz transforms on
D∞ of a family of probability measures on the unit circle (µt), called the driving
or Loewner measures of the Loewner equation. Here by the Herglotz transform on
D∞ of a probability measure µ on S1 we mean the holomorphic function H = Hµ
in D∞ with positive real part and satisfying H(∞) = 1, deﬁned by

(Hµ)(z) = ZS1

ξ + 1/z
ξ − 1/z

dµ(ξ)

(the classical Herglotz Theorem asserts that any holomorphic function H on D∞
satisfying Re H > 0, H(∞) = 1 is of this form for a unique probability measure µ
on S1). Douady and Yoccoz have shown in [DY99] the existence and uniqueness
of an s-conformal measure µ = µs,g for any C2 circle diﬀeomorphism g with ir-
rational rotation number and any s ∈ R. By an s-conformal measure for a circle
diﬀeomorphism g we mean a probability measure µ on S1 such that

µ(g(E)) = ZE

|g′(x)|sdµ(x)

for all measurable sets E ⊂ S1.

We show that for any g in Diﬀω

α(S1), the associated Loewner chain (φt) is diﬀer-
entiable for all t uniformly for z in any compact subset of D∞, and the associated
Loewner measures are the pull-backs by complex conjugation of the 2-conformal
measures of the circle diﬀeomorphisms gt = Φt(g):

Theorem 1.1. (Loewner measures are 2-conformal measures). For any g in Diﬀω
and any t ≥ 0, the right-hand derivative of the Loewner chain (φt) exists (uniformly
for z in any compact subset of D∞) and is given by

α(S1)

χt(z) =

d+
ds |s=t

(φ−1

◦ φs)(z) = z · (Hr∗µ2,gt )(z)

where µ2,gt is the unique 2-conformal measure of gt.

The existence and form of the inﬁnitesimal generator X of the semigroup (Φt)

is stated as follows:

Theorem 1.2. (Inﬁnitesimal generator of the semigroup). For any g ∈ Diﬀω
α(S1),
there exists a function X(g) holomorphic in a neighbourhood V of S1 such that for
t > 0 small the circle maps Φt(g) are deﬁned in V and

lim
t→0+

Φt(g) − g

t

= X(g)

uniformly on compacts in V . The holomorphic function X(g) is given (in V ∩ D∞)
by

X(g) = g′ · χ − χ ◦ g

where χ(z) = z · (Hr∗µ2,g)(z).

We can think of the curves (t 7→ Φt(g)) as integral curves of a vector ﬁeld X on
α(S1). The next theorem asserts the uniqueness in forward time for

the space Diﬀω
these integral curves:

Theorem 1.3. (Uniqueness in forward time of integral curves). If (gt)0≤t<ǫ ⊂
Diﬀω
α(S1) is a family of circle diﬀeomorphisms holomorphic in a neighbourhood V
of S1 such that the right-hand derivatives exist and satisfy

uniformly on compacts in V , then gt = Φt(g0) for 0 ≤ t < ǫ.

Deﬁnition 1.4 (Germ of integral curve). An integral curve (in the sense of the
previous theorem) (gt)−∞<t<t0 ⊂ Diﬀω
α(S1) deﬁned for all times t less than some
t0 is said to be a backward integral curve of X. We say that two backward integral
curves (g1

if g1
t = g2

t )−∞<t<t1, (g2

It follows from the above that if (g1

t )−∞<t<t0 are two backward
integral curves deﬁning the same germ of integral curve then in fact g1
t for
all t < t0. Any germ f with an irrationally indiﬀerent ﬁxed point gives a family of
Siegel compacts (Kt)−∞<t<t0 (parametrizing the compacts Kt by their logarithmic
capacities), and hence (by applying the germs to circle maps construction to the
pairs (f, Kt)) gives a family of circle maps (gt = gf
t )−∞<t<t0 which it is easy to
see is a backward integral curve. We show that conversely any backward integral
curve arises in this way from a germ f . Denoting the space of germs with rotation
number α by Diﬀα(C, 0) we have:

Finally in section 8 we describe some further results that can be obtained in the

2. Boundary values of the Herglotz transform

The Herglotz transform of a probability measure µ on S1 is the holomorphic

function Hµ in D deﬁned by

(Hµ)(w) = ZS1

ξ + w
ξ − w

dµ(ξ)

The real and imaginary parts of the Herglotz transform Hµ = Pµ + iQµ are given
by the Poisson and conjugate Poisson transforms,

(Pµ)(w) = ZS1
(Qµ)(w) = ZS1

|ξ − w|2 dµ(ξ)
2 Im ξw
|ξ − w|2 dµ(ξ)

The radial limits of these harmonic functions exist for a.e. ξ ∈ S1 with respect
to Lebesgue measure λ, and the decomposition of the measure µ into absolutely
continuous and singular parts with respect to Lebesgue measure µ = f dλ + µs can
be recovered from these radial limits as follows:

Theorem 2.1. (Fatou). For Lebesgue-a.e. ξ ∈ S1.
exists and equals f (ξ).

the radial limit of (Pµ)(w)

Theorem 2.2. (Poltoratski [Pol96]). Let Q denote the radial limit of Qµ on S1.
As t → +∞, the measures π

2 t1{|Q|>t}dλ converge weakly to µs.

Since we will be dealing with functions deﬁned in D∞, we will refer to the
ξ+1/z
holomorphic function in D∞ deﬁned by H(z) = RS1
ξ−1/z dµ(ξ) as the Herglotz
transform of µ on D∞. Then H(z) = ˜H(w), where w = 1/z and ˜H = Hµ is the
Herglotz transform deﬁned above which is holomorphic in D. Appropriate versions
of the above theorems hold for the boundary values of the function H. Let the
boundary values of H, ˜H be P + iQ, ˜P + i ˜Q respectively. Then P = ˜P ◦ r, Q = ˜Q ◦ r,
so for µ = f dλ + µs and ξ ∈ S1 we have

3. The Loewner equation

A hull is a connected, full, non-trivial compact K in C containing the origin. Its
complement Ω in ˆC is then a simply connected domain containing ∞, so there is a
conformal map from the complement of the closed unit disk, φ : D∞ → Ω = ˆC − K
such that φ(∞) = ∞, which is unique when normalized to satisfy φ′(∞) > 0. The
map φ has an expansion around z = ∞ of the form

φ(z) = ec(K)z + a0 +

a1
z

+ . . .

where the real number c(K) is called the logarithmic capacity of the hull K (note
that the closed disk of radius R then has logarithmic capacity log R).

Given a strictly increasing family of hulls (Kt)−∞<t≤t0 , if the domains Ωt =
ˆC − Kt are continuous for the Caratheodory topology (which holds if the family
of hulls is Hausdorﬀ continuous for example) and Kt → {0} as t → −∞, then
one can continuously reparametrize the family by logarithmic capacity so that the
associated conformal maps φt : D∞ → Ωt satisfy

φt(z) = etz + a0(t) +

a1(t)

z

+ . . .

The family of conformal maps (φt) is called a Loewner chain.

For each compact K ⊂ D∞, for each z in K the map t 7→ φt(z) is CK-Lipschitz
in t for some constant CK only depending on K ([Pom75], §6.1). Thus for each z
the derivative of φt(z) with respect to t exists for all t outside some null set Ez,
but in fact one can choose a null set E independent of z such that the derivative
with respect to t exists for all z in D∞. Moreover this derivative is of the form

d+
ds |s=t

(φ−1

t ◦ φs)(z) = zHt(z)

where Ht is a holomorphic function on D∞ satisfying Re Ht > 0, Ht(∞) = 1, and
hence can be written as the Herglotz transform on D∞ of a unique probability
measure µt on S1,

Ht(z) = ZS1

ξ + 1/z
ξ − 1/z

dµt(ξ)

The measures (µt) are called the driving or Loewner measures for the Loewner
chain (φt).

4. Conformal measures of analytic circle diffeomorphisms

A conformal measure of dimension δ for a holomorphic map f is a ﬁnite measure

µ on a f -invariant compact K such that

µ(f (E)) = ZE

|f ′(z)|δdµ(z)

for all measurable sets E ⊂ K, or, when f is a diﬀeomorphism,

f ∗µ = |f ′|δdµ

where f ∗µ is deﬁned by (f ∗µ)(E) = µ(f (E)). Conformal measures have been
studied extensively for rational maps and Kleinian groups (as Patterson-Sullivan
measures), where existence is usually proved by means of transfer operators for
hyperbolic dynamical systems. While the machinery of transfer operators is not
available for circle diﬀeomorphisms, Douady and Yoccoz prove ([DY99]) nonethe-
less the existence and uniqueness of s-conformal measures µs,g for any C2 circle
diﬀeomorphism g with irrational rotation number for every s ∈ R. Moreover the
measures µs,g depend continuously on s, g for the weak topology on measures and
the C1 topology on circle diﬀeomorphisms.

5. The semigroup (Φt)t≥0 on Diffω

α(S1)

Given an analytic circle diﬀeomorphism g with irrational rotation number α, for
ǫ > 0 small, there is a unique, strictly increasing, Hausdorﬀ continuous family of
Herman compacts (At)0≤t<ǫ totally invariant under g such that the hulls D∪At have
logarithmic capacity t. Let (Ωt)0≤t<ǫ be the family of decreasing simply connected
domains Ωt = ˆC − (D ∪ At), and let φt : D∞ → Ωt be conformal maps normalized
so that φt(∞) = ∞, φ′

t(∞) = et. We let ψt = φ−1

: Ωt → D∞.

t

The map gt := ψt◦g◦ψ−1

is holomorphic in an annulus contained in D∞ with one
boundary component equal to S1, and (as shown in [PM97]) extends analytically
across S1 to give an analytic circle diﬀeomorphism with rotation number equal to
α. This deﬁnes a map

For g in Diﬀω

α(S1), and t ≥ 0, let At(g) be a Herman compact for g such that
D∪At(g) has logarithmic capacity t (if such a Herman compact exists), let Ωt(g) :=
ˆC − (D ∪ At(g)), and let ψt(g) : Ωt(g) → D∞ be the corresponding normalized
conformal map.

Proposition 5.1. For s, t ≥ 0, Φt(Ds+t) ⊂ Ds, and Φs ◦ Φt = Φs+t on Dt+s.

8

KINGSHOOK BISWAS

Proof: For g ∈ Ds+t where s, t ≥ 0, ψt(g) maps Ωs+t(g) conformally to a domain
Ω1 such that the compact A1 given by the complement of Ω1 and its reﬂection
in the unit circle is invariant under Φt(g), hence Ω1 = Ωs′ (Φt(g)) for some s′ ≥
0. The map ψs′ (Φt(g)) maps Ω1 conformally to D∞, so the composition ψ :=
ψs′ (Φt(g)) ◦ ψt(g) maps Ωs+t(g) conformally to D∞ and satisﬁes the normalizations
ψ(∞) = ∞, ψ′(∞) = es′
et = es′+t > 0. It follows from uniqueness of the normalized
conformal mapping that ψ = ψs+t(g), so es′+t = es+t and hence s′ = s. Thus
ψs(Φt(g)) ◦ ψt(g) = ψs+t(g), from which it follows that (Φs ◦ Φt)(g) = Φs+t(g). ⋄

6. Infinitesimal generator of the semigroup

Let g be an analytic circle diﬀeomorphism with irrational rotation number α.
Let (At)0≤t<ǫ be the family of Herman compacts of g, and (Ht = D ∪ At)0≤t<ǫ the
associated family of hulls. Let Ωt = ˆC − Ht, and let φt : D∞ → Ωt, ψt = φ−1
be
normalized conformal mappings. Then the functions {(φt − id)/t : 0 ≤ t < ǫ} form
a normal family ([Pom75], §6.1).

t

Lemma 6.1. Let {tn} be a sequence decreasing monotonically to 0 such that (φtn −
id)/tn converges uniformly on compacts of D∞ to a holomorphic function χ. Then
(ψtn − id)/tn converges uniformly on compacts in D∞ to (−χ).

Proof: Fix a compact K ⊂ D∞, then for n large K ⊂ Ωtn and the maps ψtn are
deﬁned on K. We have φtn = id + tnχ + o(tn) uniformly on K. Then id = φtn ◦ ψtn
gives

id = (id + tnχ + o(tn)) ◦ ψtn = ψtn + tnχ ◦ ψtn + o(tn),

so

ψtn − id

tn

= −χ ◦ ψtn + o(1)

uniformly on K, and the lemma follows since ψtn → id uniformly on K as n → ∞.
⋄

Lemma 6.2. Let {tn} be a sequence decreasing monotonically to 0 such that (φtn −
id)/tn converges uniformly on compacts of D∞ to a holomorphic function χ. Then
(gtn − g)/tn converges uniformly on compacts in a neighbourhood V of S1 to a
holomorphic function ˙g given (in V ∩ D∞) by

˙g = g′ · χ − χ ◦ g

Proof: By the previous Lemma, the equality ψtn ◦ g = gtn ◦ ψtn gives

(id − tnχ + o(tn)) ◦ g = gtn ◦ (id − tnχ + o(tn))

uniformly on a circle {|z| = R} ⊂ D∞, so

thus

g − tnχ ◦ g + o(tn) = gtn − g′

tntnχ + o(tn)

gtn − g

tn

= g′

tn · χ − χ ◦ g + o(1) → g′ · χ − χ ◦ g

uniformly on {|z| = R}. Since the maps gtn, g are circle maps, (gtn −g)/tn converges
uniformly on the circle {|z| = 1/R} ⊂ D, hence by the Maximum Principle we have
uniform convergence on the closed annulus {1/R ≤ |z| ≤ R}. ⋄

LOEWNER EVOLUTION OF HEDGEHOGS AND 2-CONFORMAL MEASURES OF CIRCLE MAPS9

Theorem 6.3. Let {tn} be a sequence decreasing monotonically to 0 such that
(φtn − id)/tn converges uniformly on compacts of D∞ to a holomorphic function χ.
Then H = χ/id satisﬁes Re H > 0, H(∞) = 1, and is the Herglotz transform Hµ
on D∞ of µ = r∗µ2,g, where r : S1 → S1 denotes complex conjugation and µ2,g is
the unique 2-conformal measure of g.

Proof: Let χn(z) = (φtn (z) − z)/tn and let Hn(z) = χn(z)/z for |z| > 1. Since
for t > 0, Ωt is a proper subdomain of D∞, by the Schwarz Lemma |φt(z)/z| > 1
for all t > 0. The Moebius map w = (z − 1)/(z + 1) maps D∞ conformally to the
half-plane {Re w > 0}, so

Re(cid:18) tnzHn(z)

φtn (z) + z(cid:19) = Re(cid:18) φtn (z) − z

φtn (z) + z(cid:19) > 0

and letting n → ∞ it follows that (using Hn(z) → H(z), z/(φtn(z)+ z) → 1/2) that
Re H(z) ≥ 0 for all z. Moreover Hn(∞) = (etn −1)/tn, and Hn converges uniformly
to H on compacts in D∞, so H(∞) = 1. If Re H(z0) = 0 for some z0 then by the
open mapping theorem we must have H(z) ≡ H(z0) ∈ iR, contradicting H(∞) = 1,
hence Re H(z) > 0 for all z. By the Herglotz Theorem, H is the Herglotz transform
on D∞ of a probability measure µ on S1. Since r2 = id it suﬃces to show that r∗µ
is 2-conformal for g.

Let µ = f dλ + µs be the decomposition of µ into absolutely continuous and

singular parts with respect to Lebesgue measure.

By Fatou’s Theorem, the radial limits of Re H exist for a.e. ξ ∈ S1, and equal

f ◦ r. From Lemma 6.2 we have ˙g + χ ◦ g = g′ · χ, and so

˙g
g

(z) + (H ◦ g)(z) =

zg′(z)
g(z)

H(z)

By Lemma 6.2, the function ˙g is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of S1, and, since
gtn(ξ) converges to g(ξ) along S1 for ξ in S1, we have Re( ˙g/g)(ξ) = 0. Moreover
ξg′(ξ)/g(ξ) = |g′(ξ)| since g is a circle map, so taking real parts in the equation
above as z tends to ξ ∈ S1 radially gives (f ◦ r ◦ g)(ξ) = |g′(ξ)|f (r(ξ)), thus

g∗(r∗(f dλ)) = g∗((f ◦ r)dλ) = (f ◦ r ◦ g)|g′|dλ = |g′|2(f ◦ r)dλ

thus the absolutely continuous part r∗(f dλ) = (f ◦ r)dλ of r∗µ is 2-conformal.

It remains to show that the singular part ν := r∗µs of r∗µ is 2-conformal. Taking
g(z) H(z) as z tends to a point ξ ∈ S1

imaginary parts in ( ˙g/g)(z) + (H ◦ g)(z) = zg′(z)
radially gives

( ˙g/g)(ξ) + i(Q ◦ g)(ξ) = |g′(ξ)|iQ(ξ)

The function ˙g/g is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of S1, hence bounded on S1,
so ||Q ◦ g| − |g′||Q|| < M for some M > 0.

For t ≫ 1, let νt denote the measure π

2 t1|Q|>tdλ, so νt converges weakly to ν as

t → +∞.

Given ξ0 ∈ S1 and a small ǫ > 0, let U ⊂ S1 be a small interval around ξ0 in
S1 such that (1 − ǫ) < |g′(ξ)/g′(ξ0)| < (1 + ǫ) for ξ in U . For t ≫ 1 such that

Douady and Yoccoz ([DY99]) show that if log |g′| is of bounded variation (which
is the case if g is C2) then any conformal measure for g has no atoms. In particular
ν = r∗µ2,g has no atoms, hence νt(U ) → ν(U ) for any interval U . From the above
it follows that given ǫ, there is a δ = δ(ǫ) > 0 such that if U is any interval of length
less than δ, and ξ0 ∈ U , then

(1 − ǫ)3|g′(ξ0)|2ν(U ) ≤ ν(g(U )) ≤ (1 + ǫ)3|g′(ξ0)|2ν(U )

Given any interval V in S1 and ǫ > 0, let U1, . . . , Un be a partition of V into
intervals of length less than δ(ǫ) centered around points ξ1, . . . , ξn. We may assume
that the variation of |g′|2 on each Ui is less than ǫ. Then

Letting ǫ tend to 0 gives ν(g(V )) ≤ RV |g′|2dν, and similarly ν(g(V )) ≥ RV |g′|2dν.

It follows that ν = r∗µs is 2-conformal for g, hence r∗µ is 2-conformal for g and
µ = r∗µ2,g. ⋄

7. Proofs of main results

We can now prove the main results from the Introduction.

Proof of Theorem 1.1: Given g ∈ Diﬀω
α(S1), by uniqueness of the 2-conformal
measure µ2,g of g, it follows from Theorem 6.3 any normal limit χ of the functions
(φt − t)/t, t > 0 (where φt : D∞ → Ωt is the normalized Riemann mapping as

LOEWNER EVOLUTION OF HEDGEHOGS AND 2-CONFORMAL MEASURES OF CIRCLE MAPS11

before) is given by χ(z) = z · H(z), where H is the Herglotz transform on D∞ of
r∗µ2,g. Since the normal limit is unique,
φt(z) − z

→ z · H(z)

t

uniformly on compacts in D∞ as t → 0.
For any t > 0 and s > t, the map φ−1

t ◦ φs is the normalized Riemann mapping
from D∞ to the complement of the unique hull of logarithmic capacity s − t asso-
ciated to the circle map gt, so it follows from the same argument as above (applied
to gt) that

φ−1
t ◦ φs(z) − z

s − t

→ z · Ht(z)

uniformly on compacts in D∞ as s → t, where Ht is the Herglotz transform on D∞
of r∗µ2,gt . ⋄

Proof of Theorem 1.2: Given g ∈ Diﬀω
α(S1) and gt = Φt(g), since (φt − id)/t
converges uniformly on compacts in D∞ to a unique function χ as t → 0, it follows
from Lemma 6.2 that for any sequence {tn} converging to 0, the functions (gtn −
g)/tn converge uniformly on compacts in a neighbourhood V of S1 to a holomorphic
function ˙g on V satisfying (in V ∩ D∞)

So all normal limits of the normal family {(gt − g)/t} coincide, thus

˙g = g′ · χ − χ ◦ g

gt − g

t

→ g′ · χ − χ ◦ g

as t → 0, where χ(z) = z · H(z), H being the Herglotz transform on D∞ of r∗µ2,g.
⋄

Proof of Theorem 1.3: Let g ∈ Diﬀω
α(S1) be
such that g0 = g and such that the right-hand derivatives exist uniformly on a
neighbourhood V of S1, and satisfy

α(S1) and let {gt}0≤t<ǫ ⊂ Diﬀω

˙gt :=

d+
ds s=t

gs(z) = X(gt)(z) = g′(z) · χt(z) − χt ◦ gt(z)

where χt(z) = zHt(z), Ht(z) being the Herglotz transform on D∞ of the measure
r∗µ2,gt. The function p(z, t) := Ht(z) satisﬁes Re p(z, t) > 0, p(∞, t) = 1. The map
gt depends continuously on t with respect to the topology of uniform convergence
in a neighbourhood of S1, and hence, being analytic maps, with respect to C1
convergence on S1, so by [DY99] the measures r∗µ2,gt depend continuously on t for
the weak topology, hence p(z, t) = Ht(z) depends continuously on t for ﬁxed z. It
follows ([Pom75] §6.1) that there exists a Loewner chain (φt)0≤t<ǫ, where the maps
φt are normalized conformal mappings from D∞ onto a decreasing family of simply
connected domains Ωt, such that φt(z) = etz + O(1) near z = ∞, and the following
right-hand derivatives exist uniformly on compacts of D∞:

d+
ds |s=t

φ−1
t ◦ φs = χt

Let (At)0≤t<ǫ be the increasing family of annular compacts containing S1 given by
the complement in ˆC of Ωt and its reﬂection in S1, so that the hulls Ht := ˆC − Ωt
are given by Ht = D ∪ At.

Let ˜gt = φt ◦ gt ◦ φ−1

, then ˜gt depends continuously on t with respect to the
topology of uniform convergence in a neighbourhood of S1, hence so does ˜g′
t. Let
U = V ∩ D∞ be a one-sided neighbourhood of S1. For s > t, let h = s − t, then as
h → 0, we have, uniformly on any compact in U ,

so ˜gs ◦ φs = φs ◦ gs gives:

˜gs ◦ (φt + hφ′
s ◦ φt)(φ′

tχt + o(h)) = (φt + hφ′
tχt) + o(h) = φt ◦ gt + h(φ′
tχt) + o(h) = ˜gt ◦ φt + h(φ′

tχt) + o(h)

⇒ (˜gs − ˜gt) ◦ φt + h(˜gt ◦ φt)′χt + o(h) = h(φt ◦ gt)′χt + o(h)
⇒ (˜gs − ˜gt) ◦ φt + h(˜gt ◦ φt)′χt + o(h) = h(˜gt ◦ φt)′χt + o(h)

from which it follows that for any z in U , the right-hand derivative d+
all t. Since t 7→ ˜gt(z) is continuous, we have ˜gt(z) = ˜g0(z) = g(z) for all t.

dt ˜gt(z) = 0 for

The map ˜gt, being the conjugate of the circle map gt by the map φt on U , maps
the annulus φt(U ) to the annulus φt(gt(U )). Both these annuli have ∂Ht as one
boundary component, and ˜gt = g extends analytically across S1 to be univalent
in a neighbourhood of S1 containing Ht, hence g leaves At invariant. It follows
that At is the unique annular compact of g such that the hull Ht = D ∪ At has
logarithmic capacity t, hence gt = Φt(g). ⋄

Proof of Theorem 1.5: Let f be a germ with rotation number α. Let (Kt)−∞<t<t0
be the 1-parameter family of Siegel compacts of f parametrized by their logarithmic
capacities, and let φt : D∞ → ˆC − Kt be normalized conformal mappings such that
φt(∞) = ∞, φt(z) = etz + O(1) near z = ∞. Fix discs Dr ⊂ Dr0 with 0 < r < r0
such that f maps Dr univalently into Dr0 . Then for t ≪ −1, the circle map gf
t
(given by conjugating f by φ−1
t ) is univalent on φ−1(Dr − Kt), which is an annulus
in D∞ with modulus tending to +∞ as t → −∞. Therefore the family (gf
t ) forms
a normal family, and any normal limit of gf
t as t → −∞ must be a circle map
univalent on D∞, hence equal to Rα, so gf
t ), (gf2

t ) are equal, then there is a t0 ∈ R and
neighbourhoods D1, D2 of the origin such that for t < t0 there is a map ht univalent
on ˆC − Kt(f1) with h′
t(∞) = 1 conjugating f1 on D1 − Kt(f1) to f2 on D2 − Kt(f2)
(where Kt(fi), i = 1, 2 denotes the Siegel compact of fi of logarithmic capacity t).
The maps (ht)t<t0 form a normal family, any normal limit of which is univalent
on C∗ and has derivative 1 at ∞, hence must be the identity. Thus ht → id as
t → −∞, and f1 = f2.

If two germs of integral curves (gf1

t → Rα as t → −∞.

Finally, given a backward integral curve (gt)−∞<t≤c, let {tn} be a sequence in
(−∞, c] decreasing to −∞. Perez-Marco shows in [PM97] that for the circle map
gt0, there exists a germ ft0 with a Siegel compact K such that the fundamental

LOEWNER EVOLUTION OF HEDGEHOGS AND 2-CONFORMAL MEASURES OF CIRCLE MAPS13

construction of [PM97] applied to the pair (ft0, K) gives the circle map gt0. Con-
jugating by a scaling if necessary, we may assume that K has logarithmic capacity
ft0
t0 . By Theorem 1.3, for t ∈ [t0, c], gt = Φt−t0 (gt0),
t0, so K = Kt0(ft0 ) and gt0 = g
so pulling back a Herman compact for gt to the plane of gt0 and then to the plane
of ft0 gives a Siegel compact Kt(ft0 ) for ft0 of logarithmic capacity t such that
gt = g

.

ft0
t

Similarly for any n ≥ 0 we obtain a germ ftn such that gt = gftn

for all t ∈ [tn, c].
So ftn is given by conjugating gc by a conformal map φn : D∞ → ˆC − Ktn(ftn ) with
φn(z) = ecz + O(z) near z = ∞. The maps {φn} are conformal mappings on D∞
with ﬁxed derivative at ∞ and hence form a normal family. Fix an annulus U ⊂ D∞
with boundary components S1 and a Jordan curve γ such that gc is univalent on
U . The maps {ftn} are normalized univalent functions on the Jordan domains Dn
bounded by φn(γ), and hence form a normal family as well (since the Jordan curves
φn(γ) are equicontinuous). Any normal limit f then satisﬁes gt = gf
t for all t ≤ c.
⋄

t

The fact ([PM97]) that any circle map g arises from a pair (f, K), where f is a

germ with a Siegel compact K also gives:

Proposition 7.1. For any g ∈ Diﬀω
(gt)−∞<t≤c with gc = g.

α(S1), there exists a backward integral curve

Proof: Given a pair (f, K) which gives rise to the circle map g, let (Kt)−∞<t≤c
be the unique family of Siegel compacts of f parametrized by logarithmic capacity,
with Kc = K. Applying the fundamental construction of [PM97] to each pair
(f, Kt) gives a backward integral curve (gt)−∞<t≤c with gc = g. ⋄

8. Linearizable maps and conformal radius of linearization domains

Let g ∈ Diﬀω

α(S1) be a circle map which is analytically linearizable. For such a
map we have uniqueness in both forward and backward time for any integral curve
with initial condition g:

Theorem 8.1. Let (gi
such that g1

c0 = g2

c0 = g for some c0 < c. Then g1

t = g2

t for all t < c.

α(S1), i = 1, 2 be two integral curves of X

t = g2
t

t ) = Φs(g2

Proof: By Theorem 1.3 we have g1
for c0 ≤ t < c. For t < c0, we have
g = Φs(g1
t ) where s = c0 − t > 0. Let U ⊂ D∞ be an invariant annulus
for g with boundary components equal to S1 and a Jordan curve γ ⊂ D∞. Let
φ1, φ2 be the normalized conformal mappings deﬁned on D∞ conjugating g to g1
t , g2
t
respectively. For i = 1, 2, φi(γ) is an invariant Jordan curve for gi
t in D∞, and it
follows that gi
t which
gives rise to g (on conjugating by φi) is a gi
t-invariant annulus Ai ⊂ D∞ with
boundary components equal to S1 and an invariant Jordan curve γi, such that φi
maps D∞ conformally to ˆC − (D ∪ Ai) and conjugates the action of g on S1 to that
of gi

t on γi.
Let L = φ2 ◦ (φ1)−1 : ˆC − (D ∪ A1) → ˆC − (D ∪ A2), then L(∞) = ∞, L′(∞) = 1,
t on γ2. Fix a point z1 ∈ γ1 and

t is analytically linearizable. So the Herman compact for gi

and L conjugates the action of g1

t on γ1 to that of g2

14

KINGSHOOK BISWAS

let z2 = L(z1) ∈ γ2. For i = 1, 2 let ηi be a conformal map from a round annulus
{ri < |z| < 1} to Ai mapping S1 to γi such that ηi(zi) = 1, then ηi conjugates the
rotation Rα to gi
t.

Suppose r1 ≥ r2. Then the map ν := η2 ◦ (η1)(−1) maps A1 into A2, conjugates
t on γ2, and ν(z1) = L(z1) = z2, hence ν = L on
the action of g1
γ1 (since the maps ν, L diﬀer on γ1 by post-composition with a homeomorphism of
γ2 commuting with g2

t , which must be identity if it ﬁxes a point of γ2).

t on γ1 to that of g2

It follows that L extends to a univalent map from D∞ into D∞ (by setting L = ν
on A1 ∪ γ1). Since L′(∞) = 1, the Schwarz Lemma implies that L = id, hence
t = g2
g1
t .

A similar argument works if r2 ≥ r1. ⋄

We recall that the conformal radius r(D, z0) of a simply connected domain D
with a basepoint z0 ∈ D is deﬁned by r(D, z0) = h′(0) > 0, where h : D → D
is a conformal map from the unit disk to D satisfying the normalizations h(0) =
z0, h′(0) > 0. Note that a disc of radius R centered around z0 has conformal radius
If D is a simply connected domain in ˆC with basepoint z0 = ∞ then the
R.
conformal radius is deﬁned to be r = e−t where t is the logarithmic capacity of the
hull ˆC − D (so the domain {|z| > R} has conformal radius 1/R).

Let f be a linearizable germ, and let (Kt)−∞<t≤c be the family of Siegel compacts
of f parametrized by logarithmic capacity. Let D be the Siegel disk (maximal
linearization domain) of f , and let h : D → D be the normalized conformal mapping
satisfying h(0) = 0, h′(0) > 0. For some t0 ≤ c, the interiors of the Siegel compacts
Kt for t ≤ t0 are linearization domains Dt ⊂ D for f bounded by analytic Jordan
curves γt. Let r(t) = r(Dt, 0) be the conformal radius of Dt, and let R = r(D, 0)
be the conformal radius of the Siegel disk. The normalized conformal mappings
of the domains Dt are given by the maps ht : D → Dt, w 7→ h((r(t)/R)w). Let
Ωt = ˆC − Kt, and let φt : D∞ → Ωt be the normalized conformal map satisfying
φt(∞) = ∞, φ′

t(∞) > 0.

Since γt = ∂Dt = ∂Ωt is an analytic Jordan curve the maps ht, φt extend
analytically across S1, and deﬁne an associated ’welding homeomorphism’, which
is the analytic circle map wt := h−1
◦ φt|S1 : S1 → S1. The analytic circle map
kt := w−1
t (arising from the
pair (f, Kt)).

conjugates the rotation Rα to the circle map gt = gf

t

Lemma 8.2. For t < t0,
(i) The conformal radius r = r(t) of the interior Dt of γt depends smoothly on the
conformal radius e−t of the exterior Ωt of γt.
(ii) The map kt depends smoothly on t.

Proof: (i) For r ∈ (0, r(t0)), let t = t(r) ∈ (−∞, t0) be the logarithmic capacity
of the hull Kt = h({|w| ≤ r/R}). The parametrizations h|{|w|=r/R} of the Jordan
curves γt depend smoothly on r, hence the boundary values φt|S1 of the normalized
conformal mappings φt depend smoothly on r as well ([dCP03], Thm 3.4). Since
φ′
t(∞) = et is given in terms of these boundary values by Cauchy’s integral formula,
it follows that t = t(r) depends smoothly on r. As r 7→ t(r) is strictly increasing

LOEWNER EVOLUTION OF HEDGEHOGS AND 2-CONFORMAL MEASURES OF CIRCLE MAPS15

(by the Schwarz Lemma), the inverse mapping t ∈ (−∞, t0) 7→ r = r(t) ∈ (0, r(t0))
is smooth.

(ii) Since the boundary values φt|S1 depend smoothly on r and t = t(r) is smooth
by (i), these boundary values depend smoothly on t as well. By [dCP03], Thm 3.9,
the welding maps wt depend smoothly on t, hence so do their inverses kt. ⋄

Theorem 8.3. Let Ht be the Herglotz transform on D∞ of the measure r∗µ2,gt ,
and let Pt + iQt be the boundary values on S1 of Ht. Then for ξ ∈ S1, we have

parts gives the equalities asserted in the theorem (using the fact that ˙kt(ξ)/kt(ξ) is
purely imaginary and ξk′
