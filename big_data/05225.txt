Abstract

The nature of gravitational waves in a generalized gravitation theory is investigated. The linearized
ﬁeld equations and the metric tensor quadrupole moment power and the decrease in radius of an in-
spiralling binary system of two compact objects are derived. The generalized Kerr metric describing a
spinning black hole is determined by its mass M and the spin parameter a = cS/GN M 2. Using a gener-
alized gravitational theory (MOG), the gravitational wave source GW 150914 data is ﬁtted by a binary
black hole system with the masses m1 ∼ 10M⊙ and m2 ∼ 8M⊙, compared with the masses estimated by
the LIGO-Virgo collaboration using general relativity, m1 ∼ 36M⊙ and m2 ∼ 29M⊙. It is argued that
the smaller binary black hole masses accommodated by the generalized theory are in agreement with the
current electromagnetic, observed X-ray binary upper bound for a black hole mass, M ∼ 10M⊙, so the
ﬁnal quiescent black hole mass after the ringdown phase will be M ∼ 17M⊙, compared with the general
relativity prediction M ∼ 62M⊙, after energy loss from gravitational radiation. The ﬁnal spin parame-
ters for the binary components are expected to be a . 0.7. The reduced masses of the inspiralling black
holes are consistent with the observed black hole masses identiﬁed through electromagnetic observations.

Introduction

A century after the fundamental prediction by Einstein, based on his gravitational ﬁeld equations [1] of
gravitational waves [2, 3], and Schwarzschild’s derivation of his solution to the general relativity (GR) ﬁeld
equations [4], which led to the prediction of black holes, the ﬁrst direct detection of gravitational waves has
been reported [5]. The gravitational waves are produced by the merging of a binary black hole system to
form a single black hole. The measurements lead to a new access to the physical properties of spacetime and
strong ﬁeld gravity. The observations of the energy loss by Taylor and Weisberg [6], following the discovery of
the binary pulsar system PSR B1913+16 by Taylor and Hulse [7] demonstrated the existence of gravitational
waves.

In the following, we will investigate the nature of gravitational waves in a generalized gravitation theory
called Scalar-Tensor-Vector-Gravity (STVG), also known in the literature as MOG (modiﬁed gravity) [8].
The theory has been studied as an alternative to GR without (detectable) dark matter in the present universe,
and ﬁts to galaxy rotation curves and galaxy clusters have been obtained [9, 10, 11]. Moreover, the theory
has been applied to cosmology with an explanation for the growth of structure in the early universe and ﬁts
have been obtained to the CMB data [13, 14]. In the early universe cosmology, the mass of the vector ﬁeld
φµ is mφ & 10−22 eV and acts as a cold dark matter particle with density ρφ > ρb, where ρφ and ρb denote
the density of the vector particle and baryons, respectively. As the universe expands and enters the era of
the formation of stars and galaxies the time-dependent eﬀective mass decreases to the value mφ ∼ 10−28

eV, and due to the weak gravitational coupling of the particle to ordinary matter the vector particle will be
unobservable in the late-time universe.

In our generalized gravitational theory electromagnetic waves (photons) and gravitational waves (gravi-
tons) move with the speed of light. The null geodesic equation for photon paths is determined in a Jordan
frame conformal metric, and in the Einstein frame metric the gravitational constant for photon paths is
screened, yielding the deﬂection of light by the Sun, and the Shapiro time delay in agreement with GR. The
enhanced gravitational interaction experienced by photons in the lensing of galaxies and galactic clusters
leads to an explanation of gravitational lensing data without dark matter [12].

The paper is organized, as follows. In Section 2, we present the STVG ﬁeld equations, while in Section
3, we investigate the linearized weak ﬁeld approximation of the ﬁeld equations, the modiﬁed two-body
acceleration law and the tensor gravitational wave equations for a binary system. Section 4, presents the
generalized Kerr solution of the gravielectric vacuum STVG ﬁeld equations, while in Section 5, we investigate
the inspiralling merger of two black holes and the LIGO GW 150914 detection of gravitational waves. In
Section 6, we discuss the measurements of black hole masses, and we end with conclusions in Section 7.

The gravitational waves are a result of the accelerated motion of masses, so for weak gravitational ﬁelds we
can use the modiﬁed eﬀective acceleration law (29). For two particles or two spherical masses moving in
elliptical orbits about their common center-of-mass the time-averaged power radiated by the system is [15]:

We have G(R) → GN for r = R << µ−1, where µ−1 ∼ 24 kpc from the ﬁts to galaxy rotation curves

5 Black Hole Binary and the LIGO GW 150914 Gravitational

Wave Detection

The recent detection of a gravitational wave from the inspiral of a a binary black hole system [5] opens a new
era in observational astronomy. The existence of gravitational waves was inferred from observations of binary
pulsar systems [6, 7]. For the ﬁrst time the direct detection of gravitational waves has made it possible to
observe a black hole-black hole (BH-BH) merger and infer its parameters independently of electromagnetic

6

observations. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to study two-body motion of a compact-object
binary in the large velocity, strong gravitational nonlinear regime. We can witness the ﬁnal merger of the
BH-BH system and determine whether GW 150914 is consistent with the binary black hole solution in GR.
A study of this problem has been carried out [19] and it was claimed that the GW 150914 data is consistent
with GR. They found that the ﬁnal remnant black hole mass and spin, determined from the inspiral and
coalescent phases of the detected signal are compatible with the GR solution.

−4M⊙, with 3.0+0.5

The GW 150914 source lies at a luminosity distance of 410+160

−180 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z =
0.09+0.03
−4M⊙ and m2 = 29+4
−4M⊙, the ﬁnal black
hole mass is M = 62+4
−0.5M⊙c2 energy radiated away in gravitational waves, and the ﬁnal
black hole spin inferred from GR is a = 0.67+0.05
−0.07. The gravitational wave luminosity determined from GR
reached a peak value of 3.6+0.5
−20M⊙c2/s. The GW 150914 gravitational
wave detection points to it being produced by the coalescence of two black holes - their orbital inspiral and
merger and ﬁnal black hole ringdown. During the period of 0.2 s, the detected signal increases in frequency
and amplitude from about 8 cycles from 35 Hz to a maximum 150 Hz. The merging of the black holes
requires a numerical solution of the GR ﬁeld equations. This has been accomplished for GR [20, 21] and
solutions have been derived that can match the GW 150914 wave form signal. Future work will require that
numerical solutions to the generalized gravitational ﬁeld equations be obtained, leading to the determination
of gravitational wave forms.

−0.4 × 1056 erg/s equivalent to 200+30

In our gravity theory and in GR, there are two independent gravitational wave polarization strains, h+(t)

and h×(t). The polarization strains during the inspiral of the black holes can be written as [22]:

h+(t) = AGW (t)(1 + cos2 ι) cos(φGW (t)),

h×(t) = −2AGW (t) cos ι sin(φGW (t)),

(60)

(61)

where AGW (t) and φGW (t) denote the amplitude and phase, respectively, and ι is the inclination angle.
Post-Newtonian theory is used to compute φGW (t, m1,2, S1,2) where S1 and S2 denote the black hole spins,
and the perturbative expansion is in powers of v/c ∼ 0.2− 0.5. A description of the gravitational wave phase
is

Observed black holes come in two classes: the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies and
stellar-size black holes. The former are in the mass range 105M⊙ − 1010M⊙, while the latter are in the mass
range 6 − 10M⊙. The fact that the black hole masses inferred from the GW 150914 signal strength have
the values m1 ∼ 36M⊙ and m2 ∼ 29M⊙ leads to the problem of how such massive, intermediate black hole
binaries could be formed. The mass wind and metallicity Z of progenitor stars generally conspire to lead
through collapse to black holes with the mass . 10M⊙.

In our generalized gravitation theory, we can produce a solution to this black hole evolution problem.
For initial well-separated binary black holes in the weak gravitational ﬁeld regime, G(R) ∼ GN according to
the eﬀective gravitational ﬁeld strength (30) for R << µ−1 ∼ 24 kpc (determined by ﬁts to galaxy rotation
curves and cluster dynamics [9, 10]). As the two black holes, described by the Kerr-MOG and Schwarzshild-
MOG solutions, coalesce and merge to the ﬁnal black hole with G ∼ GN (1 + α), we can choose the parameter
α in a range of values of order unity.
As the two black holes merge the masses, the gravitational charges and the spins also merge to their ﬁnal
values for the quiescent black hole after the ringdown phase. During this stage the repulsive force exerted
on the two black holes, due to the vector ﬁeld charges Q1 = κm1 and Q2 = κm2, decreases to zero and
G = GN (1 + α) and Q = κM where α and M are the ﬁnal values of the quiescent black hole mass and
α. During the rapid coalescing strong gravity phase, the repulsive vector force only partially cancels the
attractive force and α and G ∼ GN (1 + α). In this merging phase, we replace (30) by G ∼ GN (1 + α) in
Eqs. (63) – (67).
Let us choose for the black hole component masses m1 = 10M⊙, m2 = 8M⊙ and α = 2.6 giving
G = 3.6GN . For the binary black holes Gm1 = 3.6GN m1 = 36GN M⊙ for m1 = 10M⊙, and Gm2 =
3.6GN m2 = 28GN M⊙ for m2 = 8M⊙. Thus, the increase of G in the ﬁnal stage of the merging of the black
holes can lead to a ﬁtting of the GW 150914 data for binary black holes in agreement with the observed values
of stellar-mass binary black holes. We have for the chirp masses McGR = 28.0M⊙ and McMOG = 7.8M⊙,
and from GN (1 + α)McMOG = GNMcGR we get

Estimating f and ˙f from the LIGO data, we obtain the chirp mass McGR = 28.0M⊙ using G = GN in
(66) and m1 = 36M⊙ and m2 = 29M⊙, and McMOG = 7.8M⊙ using G = 3.6GN , m1 = 10M⊙, m2 = 8M⊙
and α = 2.6. In the detector frame the total mass is MGR = 65M⊙ and MMOG = 18M⊙, less the mass
lost by gravitational radiation. The bounds on the sum of the Schwarzschild radii of the black hole binary
components are 2GN MGR & 191 km and 2GN MMOG & 53 km. To reach an orbital frequency 75 Hz that is
half the gravitational wave frequency the orbiting black holes were very close Newtonian point masses only
. 350 km apart.

The initial orbiting black holes are well-separated in distance from one another, so the weak gravitational
wave power emission is given by (48) with the appropriate PPN corrections included. The masses of the
two black holes are m1 = 10M⊙ and m2 = 8M⊙, and in this initial phase of the slowly inspiralling black
holes no gravitational wave signal will be detected. In the ﬁnal merging stage of the black holes the value of
G ∼ GN , obtained from the weak gravitational and slow velocity formula (30) is no longer valid for strong
gravitational ﬁelds. Thus, with α = 2.6 and G = 3.6GN , we can ﬁt the audible chirp signal LIGO data
with m1 = 10M⊙ and m2 = 8M⊙. As the black holes coalesce and the distance R decreases towards the
distance of closest approach, the ﬁnal quiescent black hole will have a total mass 18M⊙, less the amount of
mass-energy emitted by gravitational wave emission.

After the ringdown phase the quiescent black hole will be described by the generalized gravitation theory
with the Kerr-MOG metric (55). The ﬁnal mass of the quiescent black hole will be ∼ 17M⊙ with ∼ 0.9M⊙c2
energy radiated away by gravitational wave radiation, compared to the estimated mass based on GR of
62M⊙ with 3M⊙c2 energy radiated away by gravitational waves. The black hole spin is expected to have
the value a . 0.7.

6 Mass Measurements of Black Holes

Black holes play an important role in astrophysical phenomena, ranging from binaries to ultra-luminous
X-ray sources (ULXs), galaxies and quasars. Stellar-mass black holes oﬀer us the best opportunity to

investigate these objects in detail. The relative nearness and time-scale variability allow us to study their
electromagnetic properties through their accretion regimes. Accurate determinations of black hole masses
is critical to test models of massive progenitors. Although solitary black holes do not emit electromagnetic
radiation, they become detectable X-ray sources when they have a stellar companion transferring matter to
them. The robust method of measuring stellar masses uses Kepler’s third law of motion. This determines the
orbital period and the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the companion star. These two quantities combine
to determine the mass function equation [25, 26]:

f (M ) =

2πGN

=

M 3
(Mx + Mc)2 =

Mx sin3 ι
(1 + q)2 ,

(69)

where Porb denotes the orbital period, Mx the black hole mass, Mc the mass of the companion star, Kc the
radial velocity semi-amplitude of the companion star, ι the inclination angle and q = Mc/Mx the binary
mass ratio. Observed stellar black hole masses range from 3M⊙ to 15M⊙. The formation of the black holes
follows an evolutionary process depending on the initial mass of the progenitor, how much mass is lost during
its evolution and on the supernova explosion mechanism. Mass is lost through stellar winds and the amount
lost depends on the metallicity of the progenitor star. For a star of low metallicity ∼ 0.01 of the solar
metallicity, it is possible to end up with a black hole of . 100M⊙, although there is no direct observational
evidence available at present to support this. It is also conjectured that more massive black holes can be
produced in the dense stellar populations of globular clusters.

The system M33 X-7 harbors the heaviest star ever discovered in an X-ray binary orbiting the most
massive black hole found in one of these systems. A 70M⊙ star orbits a ∼ 15M⊙ black hole every 3.45
days [27, 28]. The tight orbit and the massive components make M33 X-7 an evolutionary challenge. Finding
a plausible evolutionary model has been complicated by the low luminosity of the stellar component - lower
than is predicted for a single star of mass 70M⊙.

Until observations conﬁrm the existence of stellar black holes with a mass 36M⊙ [29], we can consider
that the generalized gravitation theory ﬁtting of the GW 150914 data with black hole masses . 8 − 10M⊙
to be a challenge for the future testing of the strong gravity regime of black holes.

7 Conclusions

The role of gravitational waves in a modiﬁed gravitational theory has been investigated, and the radi-
ated gravitational wave power has been derived. It is argued from the motion of bodies in the weak ﬁeld
(2GM/c2r << 1) and slow motion approximation that the repulsive force due to the vector ﬁeld potential
cancels the enhanced gravitational force between particles, yielding the Newtonian acceleration law GN M/r2
and agreement with solar system and binary pulsar observational data [8]. The photon propagates through
a conformal metric along a null geodesic path and is screened for dense bodies such as the sun, yielding
agreement with the solar system bending of light and Cassini probe experiments [12]. The speed of elec-
tromagnetic waves (massless photons) and gravitational waves (massless gravitons) is the speed of light.
For weak gravitational ﬁelds the tensor radiated power reduces to the GR result for well-separated binary
particles in agreement with the experimental results for binary pulsars.

The generalized gravitational theory is applied to the gravitational wave detection by LIGO [5]. The ﬁeld
equations are restricted to the special case when G = GN (1 + α) ∼ constant and µ ∼ constant. We choose
for the initial inspiralling phase of the black hole merger with well-separated point mass particles, the two
black hole component masses m1 = 10M⊙ and m2 = 8M⊙, and the eﬀective coupling strength G ∼ G ∼ GN .
As the two black holes merge, the weak ﬁeld approximation is no longer valid and now G ∼ GN (1 + α).
To ﬁt the LIGO signal data, we can choose a range of values of the parameter α. We choose α = 2.6, so
that G = 3.6GN and Gm1 = 36GN M⊙ and Gm2 = 28GN M⊙ for m1 = 10M⊙ and m2 = 8M⊙. For the
modiﬁed gravity GN (1 + α)McMOG = GNMcGR for the values of the chirp mass and the frequency f and
its time derivative ˙f , obtained from ﬁts to the merging black hole LIGO signal data. This allows for a ﬁt
to the LIGO wave form signal data. After the ringdown phase, when the merger end-product relaxes to the
ﬁnal stationary, equilibrium black hole, it will have a mass M ∼ 18M⊙, less the mass ∼ 1M⊙ lost through
gravitational wave radiation. The ﬁnal quiescent black hole is expected to be described by the Kerr-MOG
black hole solution that only depends on its ﬁnal mass and spin.

It is argued that measurements of black hole masses by observations of X-ray binaries give masses
. 10M⊙, and not the masses m1 = 36M⊙ and m2 = 29M⊙ inferred from the LIGO signal assuming
the validity of GR. The observed upper bound M ∼ 10M⊙ on binary black holes masses is in accord with
the evolutionary formation models of black holes and collapse models based on supernova explosions. Thus,
the generalized gravity results we have obtained for the black hole masses are more in agreement with the
observational data and theoretical model calculations currently available for the masses of black holes than
the inferred masses derived from GR and the LIGO data.

Another important prediction of our modiﬁed gravitational theory is the size of the black hole shadow
predicted by MOG compared to that predicted by GR [18, 30]. The event horizon telescope (EHT) will
be able to determine the size of the shadow cast by photons trapped by the strong gravitational ﬁeld of
the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) with an error of about 5%, or an angular radius error
of 1.5 µas. The predicted size of the shadow for the Schwarzschild-MOG and Kerr-MOG black holes can
determine a bound on α for Sgr A*. For a Schwarzschild-MOG black hole an approximate formula for the
size of the shadow is

(70)
where rg = GN M/c2 and M = 4.23 × 106M⊙. The angular radius R = rshad/D where D = 8.3 kpc
is R ∼ 26 µas for α = 0 and R ∼ 46 µas for α = 1. This generalized gravity prediction of the size of
the Sgr A* black hole shadow in conjunction with bounds on α obtained from future gravitational wave
experimental results can distinguish for strong gravitational ﬁelds our generalized gravitational theory from
general relativity.
