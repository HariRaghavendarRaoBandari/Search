REGULARITY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION FOR THE COMPRESSIBLE

EULER EQUATIONS

EDUARD FEIREISL, PIOTR GWIAZDA, AGNIESZKA ´SWIERCZEWSKA-GWIAZDA,

AND EMIL WIEDEMANN

ABSTRACT. We give sufﬁcient conditions on the regularity of solutions to the inhomogeneous
incompressible Euler and the compressible isentropic Euler systems in order for the energy to be
conserved. Our strategy relies on commutator estimates similar to those employed by P. Constantin
et al. for the homogeneous incompressible Euler equations.

1. INTRODUCTION

We study in this paper the relationship between regularity and the conservation or dissipation of
energy for two models of ﬂuid dynamics: We consider the inhomogeneous incompressible Euler
equations,

¶ t (r u) + div(r u ⊗ u) + (cid:209) p = 0,
¶ tr + div(r u) = 0,
div u = 0,

as well as the compressible isentropic Euler equations,

¶ t (r u) + div(r u ⊗ u) + (cid:209) p(r ) = 0,
¶ tr + divr u = 0.

(1.1)

(1.2)

In both systems, r ≥ 0 is the scalar density of a ﬂuid, u is its velocity, and p is the scalar pressure.
Note however that in the incompressible case p is an unknown, whereas in the compressible system
it is a constitutively given function of the density. We consider these equations in any space
dimension (it makes sense to study (1.1) in two or more space dimensions and (1.2) in one or
more space dimensions). While the compressible isentropic Euler equations are a well-accepted
model for compressible ﬂows, the inhomogeneous incompressible Euler equations have received
somewhat less attention than its homogeneous special case (when r ≡ 1 in (1.1)). Nevertheless, a
number of results on (1.1) are available, among them [5, 6, 11, 12].

r |u|2 and for (1.2) it is 1
2

Both systems have energies which are at least formally conserved. For (1.1) the energy density
r |u|2 + P(r ), where P is the pressure potential associated
is given by 1

with p. In compressible ﬂuid dynamics, it is well-known that shocks may form, giving rise to
energy dissipation. For incompressible ﬂuids, the situation is more subtle, but it had been expected
for a long time that the energy in fully turbulent ﬂow should dissipate with a rate independent of
viscosity and, accordingly, there should exist weak solutions of the incompressible Euler equations
which do not conserve energy. Such weak solutions were eventually constructed by Scheffer [14]
and Shnirelman [15].

A common feature of these energy-dissipating solutions is that they necessarily exhibit a certain
degree of irregularity. The question therefore is how much regularity is needed to guarantee the
conservation of energy. In the context of incompressible turbulence, this question is the subject
of a famous conjecture of Onsager [13], according to which energy should be conserved if the

1

2

solution is H¨older continuous with exponent greater than 1/3, while solutions with less regular-
ity possibly dissipate energy. The ﬁrst part of this assertion was proved (for the homogeneous
incompressible Euler equations) in [3, 4, 8], while signiﬁcant progress has recently been made in
constructing energy-dissipating solutions slightly below the Onsager regularity (the currently best
available results are [1, 2]).

We give in this paper sufﬁcient conditions on the regularity of r and u to ensure the conserva-
tion of energy. Our approach relies on the idea of Constantin et al. [4] to use suitable commutator
simi-
estimates. Accordingly our regularity assumptions are stated in terms of Besov spaces B
larly to [4]. However, since we have now two unknowns r and u, it is possible to “trade” regularity
between the density and the velocity. In particular, if the velocity is sufﬁciently regular, then the
energy will be conserved even if the density is only of bounded variation.

p

The term ¶ t(r u) is nonlinear in (r ,u) and therefore requires a commutator estimate. In turn this
makes it necessary to make an assumption on Besov regularity also in time (for the homogeneous
incompressible Euler system this is not needed). One may circumvent this time regularity assump-
tion, as was done very recently in [11] for the system (1.1), by formulating the equations in terms
of the density and the momentum m = r u and obtaining the energy conservation by multiplication
e
of the momentum equation by (r u)
indicates a suitable reg-
e
/r e is no longer divergence-free, which requires a commutator
ularization. Then however, (r u)
estimate involving the pressure; as a consequence, a regularity assumption on the pressure has to
be made. We choose to rather assume some time regularity, as this approach allows us to handle
vacuum states (meaning r = 0).

/r e instead of ue , where the index e

Theorems 3.1 and 4.1 thus give energy conservation for (1.1) and (1.2), respectively, under
the assumption of Besov regularity in time and space. Theorem 4.3 states energy conservation
for (1.2) with no assumption on regularity in time, but under the assumption that r ,u ∈ BV ∩C in
space. Again, shocks provide an example that this result is optimal in the sense that the continuity
assumption cannot be dropped. For Theorem 4.3 we make use of a speciﬁc time regularization
that allows us to deduce some time regularity from the space regularity; such an argument was
already used in [10] and later in [9, 16].

Let us remark that statements similar to Theorems 3.1 and 4.1 could also be proved for the

Euler-Boussinesq equations

(W ∩(W −x )) ≤ 2kwkL¥ .

Next, let (wn) be a sequence of smooth functions that converge strictly to w in BV (W ). This means
that wn → w in L1(W ), (cid:209) wn → (cid:209) w weakly-(*) in M (W ), and, in addition, TV (wn) → TV (w),
where TV denotes the total variation. For each n, wn is in W 1,1(W ) and so we can estimate

kwn(· + x ) − wnkL1(W ∩(W −x )) ≤ |x |kDwnkL1 = |x |TV (wn).

The left hand side converges to kw(· + x ) − wkL1 because wn → w in L1, whereas the right hand
side converges to |x |TV (w) by the strict convergence.

Finally we interpolate between the L1 and the L¥ estimate to obtain

¶ tr + div(r u) = 0,
div u = 0.

Remark 3.2.

(1) If r ≡ 1, then (3.1) reduces to the homogeneous incompressible Euler
equations, and the choice p = q = 3 and a = b yields the classical result of Constantin et
al. [4] (except for the time regularity, which can be relaxed in this case).

(2) It may seem unnatural to impose regularity requirements on r , u, and r u at the same

Although Theorem 3.1 implies that the energy E(t) = 1

Consider two sets: Fe = {x ∈ Td : r (t) ≥ e } and Td \ Fe .

(3.12)

Step 1. We begin with the set Fe . From the strong convergence in L1 we conclude that, up to
a subsequence (not relabeled), (r (tn))n∈N and (r u(tn))n∈N converge a.e. in Fe . By Egorov’s theo-
rem, for every d > 0 there exists a set Ed such that |Td \ Ed | < d , where the sequence (r (tn))n∈N
converges uniformly. This allows to conclude that on the set Ed ∩ Fe for sufﬁciently large n also

((0,T ) × Td) and in the same way as in
the previous step we conclude that r (tn) is sufﬁciently small for n large enough, then r (tn)|u|2(tn)
converges to zero as e → 0. Thus (3.12) holds.

Step 2. On the set Td \ Fe observe that since u is in L¥

We end our discussion of the inhomogeneous incompressible Euler equations by recording a
special case of Theorem 3.1 which states that, if the velocity is sufﬁciently regular, we can ensure
energy conservation even when the density has jump discontinuities. More precisely, we have:
Corollary 3.4. Let r ∈ (BV ∩ L¥

Proof. Combine Proposition 2.1, Theorem 3.1 and Remark 3.2(2).

(cid:3)

In fact we can go to the extreme and assume only r ∈ L1 and u to be H¨older continuous with

exponent greater than 1/2, then still we have energy conservation.

4. ENERGY CONSERVATION FOR THE COMPRESSIBLE ISENTROPIC EULER EQUATIONS

We consider now the isentropic Euler equations,

¶ t (r u) + div(r u ⊗ u) + (cid:209) p(r ) = 0,
¶ tr + div(r u) = 0.

(4.1)

In contrast to the inhomogeneous incompressible system (3.1), the pressure p = p(r ) is no longer
a Lagrange multiplier, but a constitutively given function of the density. We will make use of the

It turns out that we can prove a theorem on the compressible system that is similar to Theorem 3.1:
Theorem 4.1. Let r , u be a solution of (4.1) in the sense of distributions. Assume

u ∈ B

for some constants r , r , and 0 ≤ a ,b ≤ 1 such that

b > max(cid:26)1 − 2a ;

1 − a

Assume further that p ∈ C2[r ,r ], and, in addition

p′(0) = 0 as soon as r = 0.

Then the energy is locally conserved, i.e.

r |u|2 + P(r )(cid:19) + div(cid:20)(cid:18)1

r |u|2 + p(r ) + P(r )(cid:19)u(cid:21) = 0

in the sense of distributions on (0,T ) × Td.

Remark 4.2.

(1) For the isentropic pressure law p(r ) = kr

g , g > 1, our C2 assumption on

p is satisﬁed if either we exclude vacuum (i.e. we assume r > 0) or we choose g ≥ 2.

(2) The conservation of total energy follows, under appropriate additional assumptions, simi-

larly to Corollary 3.3.

(3) The conclusion of Corollary 3.4 remains true. This can be interpreted roughly as follows:
Energy dissipating shocks can not form exclusively in the density, but only in the density
and the velocity simultaneously.

(4) Shocks also provide examples that show that our assumptions are sharp: A shock solution
, which embeds (see Proposition (2.1)) into
. Hence such a solution satisﬁes (4.2) with equality but fails to satisfy the conclu-

dissipates energy, but r and u are in BV ∩ L¥

sion. Besides, there are also (non-physical) BV weak solutions that produce energy.

(5) It is easy to check that under the hypotheses on the pressure p stated above, we have

P ∈ C2[r ,r ].

(6) The hypothesis on temporal regularity can be relaxed provided r > 0, meaning there is
can be used as a test function in the momentum

no vacuum. Indeed, in this case (r u)

equation, cf. [11].

We state another result on the compressible system, where we do not need to require Besov

regularity in time:

Theorem 4.3. Assume that the pressure p satisﬁes

p ∈ C2(0,¥ ) ∩C[0,¥ ), p(0) = 0.

(4.4)

Let r ∈ L¥
In addition, assume that

((0,T ) × Td), u ∈ L¥

((0,T ) × Td) be a solution of (4.1) in the sense of distributions.

u(t) ∈ BV ∩C(Td), r (t) ∈ BV ∩C(Td) for a.a. t ∈ [0,T ]

(4.5)

Then the energy is locally conserved, i.e.

¶ t(cid:18)1

2

r |u|2 + P(r )(cid:19) + div(cid:20)(cid:18)1

2

r |u|2 + p(r ) + P(r )(cid:19)u(cid:21) = 0

in the sense of distributions on (0,T ) × Td.

Remark 4.4. Following the proof of Corollary 3.3, we observe that in the situation of Theo-
rem 4.3 the conservation of total energy holds for every time without any further assumptions.

4.1. Proof of Theorem 4.1. Just as in the previous section, we mollify the momentum equation,
multiply by j ue for a test function j , and integrate in time and space to obtain (3.5). We rewrite
this again using commutators to obtain

For the ﬁrst and second integral in (4.6) we ﬁnd, as before, the relations (3.7) and (3.8), because
the corresponding computations did not require ue
to be divergence-free. It is only the third in-
tegral which requires additional attention. For this we ﬁrst need to observe that, due to the chain

Putting everything together, we see that the theorem is proved once we have shown that Re

those of Theorem 3.1, so that our previous estimates for Re
Consider ﬁrst Re

|p(s) − p(s0) − p′(s0)(s − s0)| ≤ C(s − s0)2

for every s,s0 ∈ [a,b]. Note that the constant C can be chosen independently of s,s0. Therefore

|p(r (t,y)) − p(r (t,x)) − p′(r (t,x))(r (t,y) − r (t,x))| ≤ C(r (t,x) − r (t,y))2.

Applying convolution w.r.t. y to the last inequality we get, after invoking Jensen’s inequality:

(t,x) − p(r (t,x)) − p′(r (t,x))(r e

(t,x) − r (t,x))| ≤ C(r (t,x) − r (t, ·))2 ∗y h

4.2. Proof of Theorem 4.3. Regularization

Again we will regularize in space and time, but now with different parameters. Thus we con-

sider the regularization by spatial convolution

where h

where

c h =

1
h

1[−h,0].

Note that vh enjoys lower time regularity than the standard regularization by smooth kernels.
Speciﬁcally, we identify

¶ tvh =

v(t + h) − v(t)

h

∈ X

(4.7)

provided t and t + h are Lebesgue points of a function v ∈ L1
loc(0,T ;X ). In particular, the function
vh is absolutely continuous in [h,T − h], with the derivative given by (4.7) for a.a. t ∈ (h,T − h).

We use the notation

ve ,h = (ve

)h.

Regularizing (4.1)1 we get

¶ tr e

e
+ div(r u)

where the latter equation is satisﬁed in (h,T − h).

Similarly we have

(0,T ;X ) and any 1 ≤ p < ¥

,

and

v(· + h) − v → 0 in Lp(0,T ;X ) as h → 0 for v ∈ L
where X is a Banach space. Thus we may infer that that E 1

(0,T ;X ) and any 1 ≤ p < ¥
h → 0 as h → 0.

,

It is easy to observe that the limits in E 2e ,h, E 4e ,h can be performed in the same way.
Finally, we write E 3e ,h as

E 3e ,h = −ZRZTd

where

(cid:209) (P′d (r e ,h)j )h(r u)

e ,h −(cid:16)r e ,hu

e ,h(cid:17)i dxdt,

(cid:209) P′d (r e ,h) = P′′d (r e ,h)(cid:209)

r e ,h,

and apply the same arguments to conclude. As d > 0 in (4.16) can be taken arbitrarily small, the
desired conclusion follows.
