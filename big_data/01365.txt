Abstract

We study the minimum time related to the quantum speed limit that
characterizes the evolution of an open quantum system with the help of a
simple model in the short and long time limits. We compare in particular
the situation corresponding to a unique state and several states in the
environment space. For short time intervals the results show a sensible
diﬀerence in the behaviour of the system for diﬀerent strengths of the
interaction between the system and its environment.

1 Introduction

The interval of time ∆t over which a system moves by an amount of energy
∆E has a long history which starts with the time-energy uncertainty relation
derived by Heisenberg [1] and was further generalized [2, 3, 4]. Since then a
considerable amount of work has developed from thereon, see [5]. It led to the
derivation of diﬀerent approximate estimations of the time related to the so-
called quantum speed limit tQSL. The ﬁrst important contributions concerning

the optimisation of the time duration of quantum jumps have been realized by
Mandelstam and Tamm [6] and followed by several other developments during
the 90s [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The results concerned essentially closed systems.

During the following decade up to present days the subject developed fur-
ther and extended to the case of open systems, see in particular [12, 13]. These
developments were strongly motivated by the interest in the realization of fast
electronic devices in which a given component interacts with its environment.

A large series of very recent work was devoted to the study of diﬀerent prop-
erties which govern the behaviour of tQSL in such systems such as the structure
of the system space [17],the environment space [18], the importance of the
interaction coupling with the environment and its optimization [19, 20, 21], the
role of entanglement and memory eﬀects
[24], the initial state of the system
[25], the role of a thermal environment [26], the inﬂuence of relativistic eﬀects
[27].

In the present work we aim to consider the behaviour of the time related
to the lower bound of tQSL and related quantities. We chose to perform a
numerical analysis on an open system coherent described by a spin interacting
with a bosonic environment. We ﬁrst recall the expression of the time inequality
in section 2 and develop the model and the analytic expression of the inequality
in the framework of the model in section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the results.
In section 5 we discuss and comment the results. Technical details are shown in
the Appendices.

2 The energy-time relation

We introduce here the generalized energy-time relation to open quantum sys-
tems following the developments of Deﬀner and Lutz [12, 13].

Denote by ˆρ(0)

S (t) the density operator of an isolated system S and by ˆρS(t) =
T rE[ˆρ(t)] the density operator of an open quantum system obtained as the trace
over the states of an environment E coupled to S, where ˆρ(t) is the density
operator of the closed system S ⊕ E. The system S is characterized by its
ﬁdelity

F (ˆρ(0)

S (0), ˆρS(t)) = T rS[(ˆρ(0)

S (0))1/2 ˆρS(t)(ˆρ(0)

S (0))1/2)1/2]2

(1)

which measures at time t the deviation of the open system from its initial state
at the initial time at which the system does not interact with an environment.

The deviation can be expressed in terms of an angle [14, 15] which reads

B(ˆρ(0)

S (0), ˆρS(t)) = arccos(F (ˆρ(0)

S (0), ˆρS(t))

(2)

2

which is the generalization in the case of mixed states of the angle characterizing
the overlap of two states in Hilbert space.

In the general case the time evolution of the system S is given by the master

equation

dˆρS(t)/dt = Dt(ˆρS(t))

(3)

where Dt is a positive operator.

The average energy over a unit of time exchanged between S and E can be

estimated by means of the quantity

< ∆E(t) >=

1

t Z t

0

dt′e(t′)

(4)

where e(t) is taken as the smallest of the operator, trace or Hilbert-Schmidt
norm of Dt(ˆρS(t)):

||D||op(t) = max[λi(t)]
||D||tr(t) = Xi
[λi(t)]

||D||hs(t) = [Xi

λi(t))2]1/2

(5)

The [λi(t)]’s are the time-dependent eigenvalues of Dt(ˆρS(t)) which in prac-

tice is the time derivative of the known density operator ˆρS(t), Eq.(3).

The minimum time corresponding to the quantum speed limit is then ob-

tained as given in ref. [13]:

where the lower bound time is given by

tQSL ≥ tLB

(6)

tLB = [max(1/||D||op(t), 1/||D||tr(t), 1/||D||hs(t)]| cos(B(ρ(0)

S (0), ρS(t)) − 1| (7)

( = 1 in what follows).

This time corresponds to a lower limit of the evolution time of the system. It
is the smaller the larger the denominator corresponding to the energy exchange
between S and E and the smaller the numerator, i.e. the larger the overlap
beween the initial state and the state of the system at time t.

3 Application of the inequality

3.1 Model

The system S is a spin which rotates around its Oz-axis and couples to a system
of bosons.

The Hamiltonian ˆH reads

ˆH = ˆHS + ˆHE + ˆHSE

with

ˆHS = ω ˆJz
ˆHE = βb+b
ˆHSE = η(b+ + b) ˆJ 2

(8)

(9)

(b+, b) are boson operators, ω is the rotation frequency of the system, β the
quantum of energy of the bosonic oscillators and η the strength parameter of
the coupling interaction between S and E.

In the present case HSE commutes with HS since ˆJz and ˆJ 2 commute in
the common basis of states [|jmi] which are the eigenstates of both operators.
It has been shown [16] that this class of systems does not lead to decoherence.
In the subspace of ˆJz limited to a unique spin state in j the projection of ˆHSE
on S space is diagonal in j1 and reads

hj1| ˆHSE|j2i = ηj1(j1 + 1)(b+ + b)δj1,j2

(10)

As a consequence the density operator ˆρS(t) at time t is obtained by taking the
trace over the environment states of the total Hamiltonian ˆρ(t) leading to

ˆρS(t) = T rE ˆρ(t)

whose matrix elements read

ρj1m1,j2m2

where ˆji = 2ji + 1, m1, m2 are the spin projections on the quantization axis Oz.
The bosonic environment contribution ΩE can be put in the following form

ΩE(j1, j2,; t) = 1/N (t)

n”,n(j2, t)

(14)

where N (t) is a normalization factor such that the trace of the density operator
in the total space S ⊕ E is constant in time, T r ˆρ(t) = 1, En,n′ (t), E∗
n′′,n(t) are
scalar quantities related to the coupling between S and E and nmax is the upper
limit of the bosonic quantas present in the environment. An exact analytical
expression of these quantities can be obtained by using an inﬁnite Zassenhaus
series [29] whose development is given in Appendix A. The explicit expressions
of the polynomials En1,n2(t) are developed in Appendix B.

By simple inspection of these expressions it can be seen that the non-diagonal
element of ρj1m1,j2m2
(t) may cross zero with t, oscillate and never reach and stay
at zero whatever the length of the time interval which goes to inﬁnity. This is
the signature of the fact that no decoherence of the system will be observable
in this case.

3.2 The time-energy relation in the framework of the model

In the application of the model the spin of the system is supposed to stay in
a unique j state, j1 = j2 = j = 1/2. The energy-time expression leads to the
lower bound of tQSL

tQSL ≥

| cos(B(ρ(0)

S (0), ρS(t)) − 1|
∆k(t)

(15)

which can be worked out analytically. The index k corresponds to diﬀerent
choices of the integrant e(t′) of ∆(t), whatever the smallest quantity may be,
see Eqs.(17 - 19) below. The ﬁdelity takes the form

F jm1,jm2 (ˆρ(0)

S (0), ˆρS(t)) =

2ΩE(j, j; t)(1 + cos(ωt))

ˆj2

(16)

which is a real quantity and consequently the expression of B(ρ(0)
S (0), ρS(t))
is obtained by means of Eq.(2). Finally the energy denominator max(∆k(t))
where [k = (op), (tr), (hs)] is given by

∆op(t) = Z t

4 Numerical applications

We use the present model in order to analyze the ﬁdelity and the behaviour of
the quantum speed limit under diﬀerent physical conditions. We ﬁx the energy
parameters ω = 1 and β = 1 and consider diﬀerent strengths of the interaction
ηw = 0.1 (weak coupling=W), ηi = 1.0 (intermediate coupling=I) and ηs = 5.0
(strong coupling=S). We choose diﬀerent extensions of the bosonic environment,
in practice nmax = 0, 5, 10. The system space is restricted to j1, j2 = j = 1/2.
At time t = 0 the closed system is in a pure state, the state of lowest energy is

|ψS(0)i = 1/√2(|1/2; 1/2i + |1/2;−1/2i)

(20)

The bosonic contribution at t = 0 is ﬁxed to ΩE(j, j; t = 0) = 1.

We consider ﬁrst the ﬁdelity which is the essential ingredient in the r.h.s. of

Eq.(15).

4.1 Evolution of the ﬁdelity: Bures angle

a) Weak interaction: the ﬁdelity shows an oscillating behaviour which indi-
cates that the time dependent state vector state ψS(t) rotates with time. The
evolution of F (t) for diﬀerent times t read:

For ηw, nmax = 0: F (t) = 0.39, 0.19 for t = 1, 5 resp. and F (t) ≃ 0 for
t = 15, 20. It oscillates for larger time intervals (tested up to t = 200) with
sizable amplitudes comparable to those of small periods of time.

The behaviour is qualitatively similar for nmax = 5 and nmax = 10. One
observes a saturation eﬀect from nmax = 5 to nmax = 10, the values of the
ﬁdelity are very similar to each other.

b) Intermediate interaction: the results are similar to those observed in
the weak case. The amplitude oscillations start with a similar decrease at the
beginning of the process.

For ηi, nmax = 0: F (t) = 0.29, 1.0 ∗ 10−4∗ for t = 1, 5 resp. and for

l = 10, 15, 20 F (10) = 2.2 ∗ 10−2, F (20) ≃ 0.

6

For nmax = 5: F (1) = 0.39, F (10) = 2.0 ∗ 10−2. F (20) = 1.6 ∗ 10−1.
The saturation eﬀect from nmax = 5 to nmax = 10 is again seen here. The
pseudo-period of oscillation is however somewhat shorter than in the weak case
for nmax = 5 and nmax = 10. Oscillations persist over larger time intervals.

c) Strong interaction: the ﬁdelity is large at the very beginning and gets
quickly very small for early times. The oscillation period is much shorter than
in the former cases. It goes on oscillating but with small amplitudes for larger
time intervals.

For ηs, nmax = 0: F (0.15) = 0.42, F (1) = 2.0 ∗ 10−5, F (2) = 2.0 ∗ 10−6. It
is similar for nmax = 5: F (0.15) = 0.61, F (1) = 2.0 ∗ 10−3, F (2) = 4.0. ∗ 10−4
and for nmax = 10: F (0.15) = 0.61, F (1) = 2.0 ∗ 10−3, F (2) = 4.1 ∗ 10−4. The
ﬁdelity goes on oscillating over larger period of times. The saturation eﬀect is
also present here.

In summary the ﬁdelity is an oscillating function of time for any strength of
the interaction. It is large for small times with an overall decrease in amplitude
with increasing time.
Its pseudo-period decreases with increasing interaction
strength between the system and its environment. One observes a saturation
eﬀect with an increasing number of states in the environment.

4.2 The time dependent average energy of the system

The energy average over a unit time interval < ∆E(t) > which enters the
expression of the lower bound tLB of tQSL is deﬁned in Eq.(4). The essential
trend of its temporal evolution can be characterized as shown below.

a) Weak interaction: the average energy oscillates with a similar amplitude
of the order of unity for small time intervals t ∈ [0, 20] and nmax = 0, 5, 10.
For large times (t ∈ [50, 200]) < ∆E(t) > gets smaller and the the oscillation
amplitudes get reduced.
b) Intermediate interaction and strong interaction: the behaviour is qual-
itatively the same as in the weak case with smaller amplitudes and reduced
oscillations over the time interval t ∈ [0, 200].

4.3 The quantum speed time tQSL

The lower bound tLB of tQSL deﬁned in Eq.(7) is the physical quantity of inter-
est in the present study. It depends on the behaviour of the ﬁdelity (numerator)
and the average energy per time unit present in the system (denominator). The
analysis is done with the same set of parameters as those used for the ﬁdelity.

a) Weak interaction: The lower bound tLB is always smaller than the evo-
lution time interval tLB ≤ t, whatever the extension of the bosonic space
nmax = 0, 5, 10. It is very similar in magnitude in all cases. It oscillates for times
t ≥ 6, 7 and then increases slowly, see Fig.1. For larger times (t ∈ [10, 200]) tLB

remains of the same order of magnitude and oscillates.

b) Intermediate interaction:
For nmax = 0 tLB ≥ t in the interval [0, 2], and tLB ≤ t for t ≥ 3.The

magnitude of tLB does not vary much, it oscillates for short times, see Fig.2.

For nmax = 5, 10 tLB ≤ t for all t. One observes a saturation eﬀect, for
nmax = 5, 10 the values of tLB are very close to each other. Otherwise the
behaviour is the same as in the case nmax = 0, the magnitude of the oscillations
are smaller, see Fig.2. This remains so for larger time intervals. The magnitudes
of tLB do not increase with time as it is the case in the weak regime, they even
decrease compared to their behaviour in the former regime.

c) Strong interaction:
The lower bound is again larger than t in the interval [0, 2], and tLB ≤ t
for t ≥ 3 for all values of nmax. tLB is somewhat larger for nmax = 0 than for
nmax = 5, 10 but the oscillations in time follow closely in time. The graph in
Fig.3 shows moderate oscillations for t ∈ [0, 20]. For larger times (t ∈ [20, 200])
oscillations of tLB remain but they are smaller than those observed for small
times. Like in the case of the ﬁdelity, the diﬀerence between the case nmax = 5
and nmax = 10 is negligible, the curves recover each other.

In summary:

• The lower bound of the quantum speed time tLB is generally smaller than
the time t over which the system evolved starting at an initial time t = 0.

• tLB shows oscillations which are due to the strcture of the interaction

between the system and the environment.

• There is no qualitative diﬀerence between the behaviour of tLB in the case
where nmax = 0 and nmax = 5, 10 except over short time intervals. The
fact that tLB is larger than t for small t in the case of an intermediate and
strong interaction is due to the fact that in both cases the ﬁdelity F (t)
gets rapidly small and the energy denominator < ∆E(t) >. This is notthe
case when the interaction is weak.

• The cases nmax = 5 and nmax = 10 are very similar, one observes a
saturation eﬀect with respect to an extension of the environment space in
the size of tLB.

5 Summary and comments

We used the time-energy inequality of Deﬀner and Lutz [12, 13, 21] in order to
examine the behaviour of the quantum speed limit in an non-decoherent open
quantum model [22], whether the system obeys the divisibility property which
characterizes of Markovian [23, 28] and non-Markovian systems.

The time tQSL which charaterizes the speed with which the open system in-
volves in time shows a lower bound which is governed by the ﬁdelity F (t) and an
average energy < ∆E(t) > exchanged between the system and its environment.
Both quantities oscillate in time. This is due to the nature of the density matrix
of the spin 1/2 system which shows oscillatory matrix elements. The environ-
ment space contains a set n of non-interacting bosons with diﬀerent numbers of
excitation quantas. The strength of the interaction between the system and the
environment takes diﬀerent values.

We ﬁrst analyzed the behaviour of F (t) which leads to the Bures angle [14]
and shows how the state vector of the open system evolves in time. It oscillates
in the interval [0, 1] for all values of the interaction with diﬀerent amplitudes and
periods depending on the strength chosen to be weak, intermediate and strong.
The oscillatory character is induced by the structure of the density operator of
the system. The oscillating average energy per time unit < ∆E(t) > is always
positive and reﬂects the average energy per time unit of the system. It varies
due to the energy exchange between the system and its environment.

The physically observable of interest is the lower time limit tLB itself. Diﬀer-
ent strengths lead to diﬀerent lower time bounds tLB which are generally shorter

10

than the time interval over which the system has evolved. This is always the
case when the interaction between the system and the environment is weak.

For an intermediate strength of the order of magnitude of the interaction
tLB is larger than the interval of time evolution t if t is small. The reverse gets
true for larger times t in the case where the number of states in the environment
is reduced to its ground state. It is smaller if the bosonic space contains several
excited states. For a strong interaction tLB is larger than t for small t and any
size of the bosonic space, smaller for larger t intervals.

Qualitatively the size of tLB decreases with growing strrenth of the inetrac-

tion.

There are two further points which emerge from the present study:

• As it can be seen on the ﬁgures, one observes a rather systematic ”satura-
tion” eﬀect in the sense that tLB starts to be insensitive to an enlargement
of the environment space, i.e. it remains the same when one increases the
number of excitation quanta, say by an increase from 5 to 10 excitations.
This is related to the fact that higher contributions to the quantity ΩE(t)
(Eq.14) which enters the expression of the density matrix ρS(t) get small
when the number of excitation quanta n increases.

• It has been shown in a preceding work that the evolution of an open quan-
tum system obeys the divisibility property which characterises a Marko-
vian behaviour if the environment space reduces to a unique state [21].
It is the case if the bosonic space reduces to nmax = 0 . One may ask the
question whether this property reﬂects in tLB. One observes that this time
is always shorter than any time interval t in the weak interaction regime
when the environment reduces to a single state in contrast with the other
regimes. Whether this is an indication that a Markovian process allows
a lower speed limit in the general case is an unanswered but interesting
question.

in a straightforward way [30]. If [X, Y ] = 0 the truncation at the third term
leads to the factorisation of the X and the Y contribution. If [X, Y ] = c where
c is a c-number the expression corresponds to the well-known Baker-Campbell-
Hausdorﬀ formula.

Here the expressions of the evolution operator exp(−iHt) can be rigorously
worked out analytically, hence the series can be formally summed up to inﬁnity
for any time by means of analytic continuation arguments.
