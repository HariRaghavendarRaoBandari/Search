Abstract
Cosmic reionization is known to be a major phase transition of the gas in the Universe. Since
astronomical objects formed in the early Universe, such as the ﬁrst stars, galaxies and black
holes, are expected to have caused cosmic reionization, the formation history and properties
of such objects are closely related to the reionization process.
In spite of the importance of
exploring reionization, our understandings regarding reionization is not sufﬁcient yet. Square
Kilometre Array (SKA) is a next-generation large telescope that will be operated in the next
decade. Although several programs of next-generation telescopes are currently scheduled,
the SKA will be the unique telescope with a potential to directly observe neutral hydrogen up
to z ≈ 30, and provide us with valuable information on the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch
of Reionization (EoR). The early science with the SKA will start in a few years; it is thus the
time for us to elaborate a strategy for CD/EoR Science with the SKA. The purpose of this
document is to introduce Japanese scientiﬁc interests in the SKA project and to report results
of our investigation.

1 Introduction
The epoch shortly after cosmic recombination is often called
Dark Ages (DA), since there were no luminous objects at the
epoch. Recent theoretical studies have predicted that the forma-
tion of luminous ﬁrst stars marked the end of the DA (e.g., Abel
et al. 2002, Bromm et al. 2002, Yoshida et al. 2006). The ﬁrst
stars are expected to have ﬁrstly illuminated the Universe, hence
this very early phase of the structure formation is called Cosmic
Dawn (CD). According to the standard hierarchical structure
formation scenario, more massive objects, such as galaxies,
were formed following the CD, and the increase in the num-
ber of ionizing photon sources would result in the ionization
and heating of the Universe. This global transition is known as
cosmic reionization, and the epoch when reionization dramat-
ically proceeded is the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Recent
observations have provided us with fruitful information on cos-
mic reionization. For instance the spectra of high-z quasars
(QSOs) tell us that the Universe was almost ionized by z ∼ 6
(e.g., Fan et al. 2006), and the decrease in the number density
of Lyα emitters (LAEs) from z ∼ 6 to z ∼ 7 implies that neutral
hydrogen fraction increased with redshift at z > 6 (e.g., Konno
et al. 2014).
In addition, the optical depth to Thomson scat-
tering of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons mea-
sured by the Planck satellite is τe = 0.066± 0.016, which corre-
sponds to an instantaneous reionization redshift of zr = 8.8+1.7
−1.4
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2015). Therefore a gradual reion-
ization history is required for satisfying all of the observational
facts. In contrast to the advancing knowledges on the time evo-
lution of cosmic reionization, it is still difﬁcult to impose critical
constraints on the types of ionizing sources and the topology
of reionization, because we have never had key observations
to know the spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen during the
EoR.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is a next-generation tele-
scope that will be fully operated in the next decade, and is ex-
pected to be capable of detecting the redshifted hyper-ﬁne struc-
ture transition line of neutral hydrogen, i.e. 21-cm line, during
the CD/EoR. Therefore it will be possible to know more detailed
information on neutral hydrogen up to z ≈ 30 with the SKA. In
the international SKA science book published in 2015 1, the in-
ternational SKA CD/EoR science working group (SWG) mem-
bers have proposed what we will be able to learn from obser-
vations with the SKA. Although some studies on the CD/EoR
by Japanese scientists are already described in the international
SKA science book, there are additional activities that signiﬁ-
cantly contribute to the CD/EoR Science with the SKA. Hence
the purpose of this document is to introduce Japanese scientiﬁc
interests in the SKA project and to report results of our inves-
tigation. It is still in progress, so that the document may not

fully cover previous works related to the SKA. We wish that
the document becomes an interface for future communications,
collaborations, and synergies with worldwide communities.

This document is organized as follows.

In section 2, we
brieﬂy review some topics on the CD/EoR proposed in the in-
ternational SKA science book. Subsequently in section 3, the
main body of this article, we introduce the current status and fu-
ture prospects of SKA-Japan consortium (SKA-JP) EoR SWG.
Finally section 4 is devoted to the summary.

2 Current status of CD/EoR Science with the

SKA

For the purpose of achieving various CD/EoR science goals,
three key observational plans, the shallow, medium, and deep
surveys, are currently proposed for SKA1-low. The survey area
and the observing time are 10,000 sq. degree and 10 hours/ﬁeld
for the shallow survey, 1,000 sq. degree and 100 hours/ﬁeld for
the medium survey, and 100 sq. degree and 1,000 hours/ﬁeld
for the deep survey. During the EoR, 1 degree roughly corre-
sponds to ∼ 100h−1Mpc. The shallow and medium surveys
will be carried out mainly for the power spectrum analysis, and
the deep survey mainly for the imaging analysis. As for the
21-cm forest analysis, a different kind of observation in which
1,000 hours integration targeting a high-z radio loud source will
be required. In the international SKA science book published in
2015 (e.g., Koopmans et al. 2015; Ahn et al. 2015a; Ciardi et al.
2015b; Jelic et al. 2015; Maio et al. 2015; Mellema et al. 2015;
Mesinger et al. 2015; Pritchard et al. 2015; Semelin & Iliev
2015; Wyithe et al. 2015), numbers of topics on the CD/EoR
science have already reported. In this section, we brieﬂy intro-
duce major CD/EoR Science partly developed by the interna-
tional SKA CD/EoR SWG, and partly presented in the interna-
tional SKA Science Book.

2.1 Basics of 21-cm signals during CD/EoR

When we observe redshifted HI 21-cm signals during the EoR,
the signals will be observed as the difference from the CMB
light. Previous studies (e.g., Madau et al. 1997) have shown
that the deferential brightness temperature δTb can be written
as

δTb ≈ 27xHI(1 + δ)(cid:16) 1 + z

tion, the CMB temperature and the spin temperature of the 21-
cm transition, respectively. Eq. (1) indicates that the bright-
ness temperature δTb in a warm (Ts > TCMB) region is positive,
while that in a cold (Ts < TCMB) region is negative. In the par-
ticular case of Ts ≫ TCMB the brightness temperature is inde-
pendent of the spin temperature anymore. As shown by Eq. (1),
the ionization state of the intergalactic matter (IGM) is impor-
tant for determining the amplitude of δTb. It is also important
to know the thermal state of the IGM, since the spin tempera-
ture Ts is expected to be coupled with gas temperature Tgas via
atomic collisions and Lyα pumping (Wouthuysen-FIeld (WF)
effect, Wouthuysen 1952, Field 1959). The ionization and ther-
mal states of the IGM are essentially determined by properties
of ionizing sources, such as emissivity, spectral type and spatial
distribution. Often the properties of ionizing sources are regu-
lated by some astrophysical processes called feedback that will
be described in the next section.

2.2 Ionizing sources and related feedback processes

Observationally there is no crucial evidence for the kinds of the
objects that actually caused cosmic reionization, but some can-
didates have been proposed theoretically. The ﬁrst stars were
presumably the ﬁrst ionizing sources, because they are thought
to have been typically massive and emitting sufﬁcient ionizing
photons (Abel et al. 2002; Bromm et al. 2002; Yoshida et al.
2008; Hosokawa et al. 2011; Hirano et al. 2014; Susa et al.
2014).
It is important to consider feedback effects for quan-
tifying the contribution of the ﬁrst stars to cosmic reionization
as discussed later. After the epoch of the ﬁrst star formation,
high-z galaxies are plausible candidates of ionizing sources,
since a large number of galaxies have been already discovered
at z > 6 (Ouchi et al. 2010; Konno et al. 2014; Bouwens et al.
2015; Oesch et al. 2014; Robertson et al. 2015). One of the im-
portant processes deciding the number of ionizing photons pro-
vided by the galaxies is the escape of ionizing continuum radia-
tion. Many observational and theoretical studies have proposed
various values of the escape fraction fesc, hence there is no obvi-
ous consensus on the value of fesc, although most of numerical
studies have shown a similar trend, i.e. fesc decreases with the
halo mass (Razoumov & Sommer-Larsen 2010; Yajima et al.
2011; Wise et al. 2014; Paardekooper et al. 2015). Feedback
effects are also important, since they play important roles in
deciding the intrinsic ionizing continuum emissivity by regulat-
ing star formation rates (SFRs) in galaxies. It is also expected
that X-ray radiation from X-ray binaries and active galactic nu-
clei (AGNs) contributed to the ionization and heating of the
Universe. As shown later in §2.4 and §2.5, the impact by high
energy X-ray photons on HI 21-cm signals are expected to be
signiﬁcantly different from those by ultraviolet (UV) photons
because of long mean free paths of the high energy photons.

As mentioned above, feedback effects severely affect the
number of ionizing photons from the ionizing sources.
It is
widely known that radiative feedback is one of important feed-
back processes. Since ionizing photons heat gas temperature up
to ∼ 104K, the photo-heating leads to the evaporation of low-
mass systems with virial temperatures of Tvir < 104K (Petkova
& Maio 2012; Dale et al. 2012). Even in more massive galaxies,
photo-heating may decrease SFRs via preventing the interstel-
lar gas from fragmentations (Hasegawa & Semelin 2013). Wise
et al. (2012) have shown that radiation pressure, in addition to
the thermal pressure by the ionized gas, affects the motion of the
interstellar gas. Expelling the gas from galaxies via the radia-
tive (Wise & Cen 2009; Umemura et al. 2012) and supernova
(SN) feedback (Kimm & Cen 2014) also affects fesc. Photo-
dissociation of hydrogen molecules H2, which are main coolant
in primordial gas with Tgas < 104 K, by Lyman-Werner (LW)
radiation is another type of radiative feedback (e.g., Omukai &
Yoshii 2003; Susa 2007; Hasegawa et al. 2009). The long mean
free path of LW radiation compared to ionizing radiation results
in the global suppression of the ﬁrst star formation (O’Shea &
Norman 2008; Ahn et al. 2012; Hirano et al. 2015).

Recently Tseliakhovich & Hirata (2010) have pointed out
another type of feedback. They have shown that after cosmic
recombination baryons and cold dark matter (CDM) had super-
sonic relative ﬂow and that the relative motion can introduce
non-negligible effect on the structure formation in the early
Universe. Compared with the sound speed of 6 km/s just af-
ter cosmic recombination, the rms of the relative velocity is
around 30 km/s. Such supersonic relative velocity affects the
formation of dark matter (DM) halos with the mass of 105–107
M⊙. Interestingly, DM halos with these mass scales are thought
to have hosted the ﬁrst generation of stars and galaxies in the
cosmological context. Therefore, the relative velocity makes
a sizable impact on the structure formation in the EoR and
hence the progress of cosmic reionization (Maio et al. 2015).
Cosmological numerical simulations (Naoz et al. 2012; Naoz
et al. 2013; Maio et al. 2011) have shown signiﬁcant decrease
in the halo abundance and gas fraction in the DM halos under
the presence of the supersonic relative velocity, which leads to
the succeeding delay of the star formation activity and the reion-
ization of the surrounding IGM.

2.3 Methods for Modeling Reionization

The redshifted 21-cm signals will provide full
three-
dimensional HI distributions during the CD/EoR. Then we
need modeling for extracting what we want to know from the
detected signals. For the purpose, direct numerical simula-
tions and semi-numerical/analytic methods are currently pop-
ular ways.

The approach of direct numerical simulations is further cat-

4

Japan SKA Consortium (2016)

egorized into two broad types. The ﬁrst type is radiation
hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations resolving small-scale struc-
tures under the inﬂuence of the feedback mentioned in §2.2
(Gnedin & Ostriker 1997; Ciardi et al. 2000; Ricotti et al. 2002;
Hasegawa & Semelin 2013). The second type is large-scale
simulations in which radiative transfer (RT) is usually dealt as
post-processing (Iliev et al. 2006; Trac & Cen 2007; Iliev et al.
2014). The simulations belonging to the latter type allow us
to assess the global reionization process and its observational
signatures, but we usually need appropriate sub-grid models to
consider the feedback and small-scale structures.

The early approach of semi-numerical/analytic methods is
mostly based on the excursion-set formalism in which the
number of ionizing photons is estimated by using analyti-
cally derived halo mass functions (Furlanetto et al. 2004; Sethi
2005; McQuinn et al. 2006). The advantages of the semi-
numerical approach compared to direct RT simulations are the
speed and ease of use. Recent semi-numerical simulations
take spatial distributions into account by adopting Lagrangian
Perturbation Theory (LPT) or N-body simulation (Zahn et al.
2007; Choudhury et al. 2009; Mesinger et al. 2011; Kim et al.
2013b), but the evolution of HII bubbles is simply evaluated
by the balance between the number of produced ionizing pho-
tons and that of atoms, instead of solving RT. Results by semi-
numerical approaches often show good agreement with those by
RT simulations on large-scales (>
∼Mpc) (e.g., Majumdar et al.
2014), however further comparisons including detailed physics
would be required.

2.4 Power-spectrum analysis

In HI 21-cm power spectrum analysis, we often focus on three
remarkable epochs (Furlanetto 2006; Mesinger et al. 2014; Ahn
et al. 2015a). Firstly, redshifted UV radiation emitted by early
stellar population is expected to contribute to Lyα pumping, and
induce a remarkable peak on the HI 21-cm power-spectrum.
It is often believed that X-ray heating epoch follows the Lyα
pumping epoch. As already mentioned in §2.2, much longer
mean free paths of X-ray photons lead to mostly uniform heat-
ing of the IGM and produce another peak in the large-scale
power spectrum. Finally in the EoR, the power spectrum is
again boosted due to the quite inhomogeneous HI distribution.

Observation of the HI 21-cm signals is a big technical chal-
lenge because we have a number of possible contaminations
including foreground emission by the Galaxy and nearby ra-
dio galaxies, and the ionospheric emission of the earth atmo-
sphere. Furthermore, the intensity of the HI 21-cm signals is
much smaller than those of contamination sources by many or-
ders of magnitude, and its detection is technically quite chal-
lenging. Cross-correlation with data in different wavebands is
an effective way to detect signals from noisy observational data.

Since the CMB data contain the kinematic Sunyaev–Zel’dovich
(kSZ) effect which is the temperature ﬂuctuation originated
from the Thomson scattering during the EoR, cross-correlation
with the CMB data could yield interesting information on the
EoR. Many theoretical and numerical studies (Alvarez et al.
2006; Adshead & Furlanetto 2008; Cooray 2004; Slosar et al.
2007; Tashiro et al. 2010) have shown that the kSZ effect and
the HI 21-cm signals anti-correlate on the scales of the typical
size of ionized bubbles, and correlate on larger scales. In par-
ticular, the correlation on larger scales depends on the rate of
overall reionization (Tashiro et al. 2010).

Correlation with high redshift galaxies is also important be-
cause they are tracers of cosmological density ﬁeld as well as
the sources of cosmic reionization (Lidz et al. 2009; Wiersma
et al. 2013). Before and in the early phase of cosmic reion-
ization, the HI 21-cm signals and the galaxy number density
are expected to correlate on large scales.
In the intermediate
stage of reionization, they anti-correlate because ionizing pho-
tons emitted by high redshift galaxies ionize the surrounding
IGM and hence reduce the HI 21-cm signals, where the scales
of the anti-correlation reﬂect the size of the ionized bubbles.

It is also expected that signiﬁcant fraction of galaxies and
stars in the EoR can be observed in the form of diffuse near in-
frared radiation. Thus, in the same manner, we can expect the
cross-correlation of the HI 21-cm signals with the the near in-
frared background (NIRB). Fernandez et al. (2014) have inves-
tigated the HI 21-cm signals and NIRB based on the numerical
simulations of cosmic reionization, and found that the NIRB
anti-correlates with the HI 21-cm signals as reionization pro-
ceeds.

2.5 Imaging analysis

When we observe a spatial distribution of the differential bright-
ness temperature δTb with a frequency ν0, the obtained map re-
ﬂects the distribution of HI atoms at the redshift z = ν21/ν0 − 1
where ν21 is the frequency corresponding to wavelength 21-
cm, i.e. ν21 = 1.42GHz. Thus the imaging tells us the three-
dimensional distributions of neutral hydrogen at high redshifts.
This is a reason why we are trying to do the imaging analysis,
although it is more challenging than the power spectrum analy-
sis. As for the imaging analysis, the rms noise of the brightness
temperature for a bandwidth ∆ν can be given by

∆Tb ≈ 0.05 + 0.66(cid:16) 1 + z

where θb is the angular resolution, and tint is the integration
time (Wyithe et al. 2015).

Here we brieﬂy present some studies on the imaging analy-
sis proposed in the international SKA science book. By semi-

Japan SKA Consortium (2016)

5

numerical simulations, Kim et al. (2013a) have shown that the
size distribution of HII bubbles is sensitive to the typical mass
of galaxies providing ionizing photons to the IGM. Since the
typical mass is determined by the efﬁciencies of feedback pro-
cesses, the imaging analysis will bring new insights into the
feedback processes during the EoR. Although the EoR imag-
ing mainly focuses on large HII bubbles (R >
∼ 20Mpc), it will
be interesting to clarify the distribution of δTb around a UV
source accompanied by a X-ray source. Chen & Miralda-
Escud´e (2008) have simulated the emergent signatures in that
case assuming a simpliﬁed density ﬁeld, and shown that a
mostly ionized region (δTb ≈ 0) surrounded by a X-ray heated
region (δTb > 0) and a further Lyα pumping region (δTb < 0)
appear. Ahn et al. (2015b) have also elucidated the properties
of the 21-cm signature around a rare-peak halo in a cosmolog-
ical simulation and concluded that the SKA may enable us to
distinguish the types of ionizing sources in such a halo.

2.6 21-cm forest analysis

When we observe a spectrum of a high-z radio loud source,
foreground 21-cm absorption lines are expected to be im-
printed on the spectrum. The 21-cm absorption feature reﬂects
the HI distribution along the line-of-sight (Furlanetto & Loeb
2002; Ciardi et al. 2015b). This analysis is similar to Lyα forest
except for using 21-cm absorption lines instead of Lyα, thus is
called 21-cm forest analysis. The observed ﬂux can be written
as Sobs = (1 − e−τ21 )Sin, where τ21 is the optical depth of the
21-cm line and Sin is the intrinsic ﬂux of the background ra-
dio source. Previous studies on the 21-cm forest have shown
that strong absorption features are mainly caused by small scale
structures (few tens of physical kpc) that cannot be resolved by
other approaches utilizing 21-cm lines (Carilli et al. 2002; Xu
et al. 2009). Therefore the 21-cm analysis is the unique tech-
nique which can probe the very small scale structures, but there
is a big difﬁculty in detecting 21-cm forest.

The minimum ﬂux density of the background source re-

quired for the observation can be written as

Smin =

2kBTsys
A√∆νtint

S
N

(3)

where S/N, kB, ∆ν, Aeﬀ, and Tsys are the signal-to-noise ratio,
the Boltzmann constant, the frequency resolution, the collecting
area of the array, and the system noise, respectively. Ciardi et al.
(2015b) have shown that Smin roughly corresponds to 10 mJy
assuming S/N = 5, ∆ν = 5 kHz, Aeﬀ /Tsys = 1000 m2K−1, and
tint =1000 hours for the SKA-1 low. Although four times bet-
ter Aeﬀ /Tsys with the SKA2 is expected to reduce Smin, there
is a large uncertainty in the abundance of such luminous radio
sources during or before the EoR. If ﬁrst stars were massive
as theoretically predicted and caused GRBs at their death, the
GRBs might be bright enough to use for the background light

of the 21-cm forest (Toma et al. 2011).

2.7 Cosmology in the EoR/CD Eras

In the cosmological context, the SKA provides us with cosmo-
logical information of previously unobserved high redshift uni-
verse in an unprecedented spatial resolution, and thus it is a
unique tool to probe many unsolved problems in cosmology.

The SKA observes the brightness temperature of the HI 21-
cm line as a tracer of cosmological density ﬁeld. In a very ide-
alized situation where spin temperature is much higher than that
of CMB and the gas is neutral, the brightness temperature is a
unbiased tracer of the cosmological density ﬁeld. Under such
situations, SKA has a better capability to observe the density
ﬂuctuation than the Planck satellite, especially on smaller scales
(Pritchard & Pierpaoli 2008; Barger et al. 2009).

In the actual observations of HI 21-cm lines, however, we
have many astrophysical processes such as reionization and
heating of the IGM by astrophysical objects which affect the
brightness temperature in a complicated manner.
In order to
discriminate the astrophysical contribution from the cosmolog-
ical signals, theoretical or phenomenological models for these
astrophysical processes is useful (Mao et al. 2008). The red-
shift space distortion of the power spectrum of brightness tem-
perature is also useful as a cosmological probe (McQuinn et al.
2006; Mao et al. 2008).

One of the interesting cosmological targets of SKA is the
nature of DM. As an alternative to CDM which has a possi-
ble deﬁciencies on sub-Mpc scales, warm dark matter (WDM)
is a new candidate of DM with smaller mass (∼ keV) and is
expected to suppress structures on small scales. This suppres-
sion is more signiﬁcant in the earlier universe, and delays the
star/galaxy formation in high redshift universe. This feature
is expected to be observed with the SKA through astrophysi-
cal contribution to the HI 21-cm signals (Sitwell et al. 2014).
Annihilation of DM which heats the IGM uniformly, unlike the
heating by astrophysical objects, can be also addressed by the
HI 21-cm signals (Evoli et al. 2014).

3 CD/EoR Science by Japanese Researchers
3.1 GYUDON Project
As shown in §2, the SKA will provide us with valuable infor-
mation on the early phase of structure formation and the cosmic
reionization process. However we need some tools for getting
understandings on what we want to know from observations
(see §2.3). For the purpose, we are developing a novel semi-
numerical code GYUDON2 (Galaxies and the Young Universe:
DO-it-yourself Numerically), which is designed to forecast HI

21-cm signals during the CD/EoR. GYUDON will allow us to
compute the structure formation during the EoR, spatial distri-
butions of HII bubbles generated by the ionizing sources and
the corresponding maps of 21-cm signals.
In GYUDON, we
pay special attention to the models of galaxies and IGM so that
we precisely forecast the 21-cm signals.

As described in §2.2 and §2.3, the feedback on the SFRs
and fesc of galaxies is crucial for calculating the reionization
history, however the ionizing photon emissivities of galaxies
have been frequently treated with simple assumptions. Thus
we ﬁrstly construct a model of galaxies by analyzing the results
of RHD simulations (Hasegawa & Semelin 2013, Hasegawa in
prep.). With the model, the dependences of intrinsic ionizing
photon emissivity and fesc on the halo mass, that are regulated
by the radiative and SN feedback effects, can be automatically
considered. Fig. 1 shows the numerically obtained spectral en-
ergy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at z =6, 7 and 8. As shown
by the ﬁgure, the intrinsic UV continuum luminosity monoton-
ically increases with the halo mass, while the escape fraction
shows the opposite trend. Although these dependences proba-
bly affect the size distribution of HII bubbles, the dependences
have often been neglected in previous simulations. It is worth to
emphasize that the simulated UV (1500 ˚A) luminosity functions
at z > 6 are well consistent with observed ones (e.g., Bouwens
et al. 2015). However we should recall that there is no consen-
sus on the absolute value of fesc during the EoR (§2.2). Thus
free choice of fesc(Mhalo) as well as that derived from the RHD
simulations are allowed in GYUDON. In GYUDON, the SED
model is applied to each halo according to the halo mass in or-
der to determine the number of ionizing photons.

The distribution of matters at a given redshift is often com-
puted by LPTs in which individual DM halos usually cannot

be resolved. Since ionizing photons emissivities are assigned
to individual halos in GYUDON, the use of N-body simulation
results in which individual halos are resolved is preferred. An
alternative choice for generating the matter distribution is to use
COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method (Tassev
et al. 2013). In addition to enough high resolution to resolve ha-
los, we have to model the baryonic component of the IGM since
only the distribution of DM can be obtained by N-body sim-
ulations or COLA. The clumping factor deﬁned as hρ2i/hρi2
of DM is generally thought to monotonically increase as the
time goes by (e.g., Iliev et al. 2006), but at the same time it
is almost certain that gaseous components are smoothened by
photo-heating (e.g., Pawlik et al. 2009). The smoothing leads
to the modulation of effective recombination rate by changing
the clumping factor. In order to consider the feedback on the
IGM clumping factor appropriately, we make a model for it
by analyzing RHD simulations (Hasegawa, Ishiyama, Inoue in
prep.). As shown in Fig.2, we express the HII clumping factor

dense regions and the smoothing is mainly caused by photo-
heating. In GYUDON, the HII clumping factor table is referred
every timesteps according to the local density and ionized frac-
tion for evaluating the local recombination rate appropriately.

Fig.3 shows the map of δTb in a small 20 comoving Mpc
cubed box, obtained by a trial RT simulation utilizing the mod-
els of galaxies and IGM described above. We are planning to
perform further RT/semi-numerical simulations with a larger
box, several hundreds comoving Mpc on a side, for the direct
forecast of 21-cm signals during the EoR. Here note that the
progress of ionization will be solved by a semi-numerical ap-
proach instead of RT calculations in GYUDON.

In the trial calculation described in the previous paragraph,
we ignored radiation from AGNs, because the number of AGNs
during the EoR is still highly uncertain. Due to the uncertainty,
it was difﬁcult to consider the appropriate amount of UV/X-ray
radiation from AGNs in previous simulations. In the last decade
UV/X-ray radiation from AGNs was usually thought to have
little contribution to the ionization process, although its impact
on the signature of HI 21-cm signals due to X-ray heating has
been pointed out (e.g., Baek et al. 2010). The AGN abundance
at z <
∼ 4 is well known and is thought to be major contributor
to X-ray Background (XRB) at energies below ∼8 keV (e.g.,
Ueda et al. 2014), whereas AGN abundance at z >
∼ 4 is less well-
known. Although it was generally believed that the number of
AGNs drastically decreases towards higher redshifts, Giallongo
et al. (2015) have recently found a higher AGN abundance at

z ∼ 4 − 6 by counting the number of faint AGNs.
If such a
high AGN abundance is valid beyond z ∼ 6, AGNs might have
signiﬁcant contribution to reionization.

In Yoshiura et al. (2016), we succeeded in constraining
AGN abundance at z >
∼ 3 by comparing numerically computed
HI/HeII reionization histories to several observations regarding
HI/HeII fractions at various redshifts. Assuming that the AGN
abundance evolves as (1 + z)β at z > 3, we ﬁnd that β should
lie between ∼ −4 and ∼ −3 with the ionizing photon escape
fraction of fesc ∼ 0.2 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, if the high AGN
abundance claimed by Giallongo et al. (2015) is valid at z > 6
and the escape fraction of ionizing photons from high-z galax-
ies is as small as 1%, the numerical model can satisfy all the
observational constraints regarding HI/HeII fractions. It simul-
taneously means that there is a degeneracy between fesc and
β. Unfortunately it is difﬁcult to resolve the degeneracy by on-
going observational instruments, but the SKA will be able to
resolve it by bringing the map of δTb. The constrained AGN
model made in this work will be implemented to GYUDON so
as to include the effects of AGNs as far as the current observa-
tional constraints allow.

at z ≈ 20. This is because the dominant component of 21-cm
bispectrum is different at each epoch. In order to see what the
dominant component in the 21-cm bispectrum is, we decom-
pose the 21-cm bispectrum. Here we deﬁne a new parameter
η = 1− TCMB/Ts and rewrite Eq. (1) as
δTb = δTb(1 + δm)(1 + δxH )(1 + δη),

(5)

where δm, δxH and δη are respectively the ﬂuctuations of the
matter, neutral hydrogen fraction and η. By using Eq. (5)
we decompose the 21-cm bispectrum into the auto- and cross-
correlations of δm, δxH and δη;

BδTb = (δT b)3[Bδm + BδxH

+ Bδη

+(cross correlation terms)

+(higher order terms)],

(6)

where Bδm, BδxH
and Bδη denote the auto-correlation terms
of δm, δxH and δη, respectively. Fig. 5 shows each component
of the 21-cm bispectrum at z ≈10, 14, 20, and 27. As shown
by Fig. 5, the bulk of the 21-cm bispectrum at z ≈20 comes
from both the matter and spin temperature ﬂuctuations, while at
the other epochs those are mainly determined by the spin tem-
perature and/or the neutral fraction. It is expected that we ob-
tain more detailed information on the IGM during the CD/EoR
by using the 21-cm bispectrum in the future experiments, com-
bined with the power spectrum and skewness.

As described above, the bispectrum is a promising observ-
able to probe the CD/EoR, but its detectability was not inves-
tigated. Therefore in Yoshiura et al. (2015), we estimated the
thermal noise for the bispectrum observation. Because the ther-
mal noise follows a Gaussian distribution, the ensemble average
of the noise bispectrum vanishes and the variance of the noise
bispectrum contributes to the bispectrum signal. We developed
a formalism to calculate the noise bispectrum for an arbitrary
triangle, taking the array conﬁguration into account. Deﬁning
K ≡ |k1| and k ≡ |k2| = |k3|, the bispectrum variance due to
the thermal noise is estimated as

3.2 Bispectrum and its detectability

Since mapping the brightness temperature requires high spatial
resolution, it is important to study the properties of the 21-cm
ﬂuctuations statistically as a ﬁrst step. In Shimabukuro et al.
(2015b), we studied the properties of the variance and skew-
ness of the 21-cm ﬂuctuations and found that the skewness is a
good indicator of the epoch when X-ray heating starts working
effectively.

However, the skewness does not tell us the information on
the scale dependence of 21-cm ﬂuctuations, since the skewness
is obtained by integrating bispectrum over wavenumbers. Thus
we need to study the bispectrum of 21-cm ﬂuctuations to as-
sess the scale dependence. Furthermore, the bispectrum analy-
sis is useful to investigate non-Gaussian features that are likely
caused by the various astrophysical effects such as the WF ef-
fect, X-ray heating and reionization. Despite the importance
of the bispectrum analysis, the properties of the bispectrum of
the 21-cm ﬂuctuations have never been elucidated. Therefore in
Shimabukuro et al. 2015a, we ﬁrstly focus on the bispectrum of
the 21-cm signals. The 21-cm bispectrum is deﬁned by

hδ21(k1)δ21(k2)δ21(k3)i = (2π)3δ(k1 + k2 + k3)

×B(k1, k2, k3),

(4)

where, δ21 = δTb− δTb, and δTb is the mean brightness temper-
ature. We compute maps of the 21-cm brightness temperature
by utilizing 21CMFAST (Mesinger et al. 2011), and calculate
the 21-cm bispectrum with respect to the maps. As a result, we
ﬁnd that the 21-cm bispectrum is almost scale invariant at z ≈
10, 14 and 27. On the other hand, it increases with wavenumber

shown in Fig.6, it was found that the SKA has enough sensitiv-
ity for k <
∼ 0.3 Mpc−1 (comoving). HERA also has enough sen-
sitivity, however, because of short baselines, it will not observe
signal on small scales. On the other hand, LOFAR and MWA
have sensitivity for the peaks of the bispectrum as a function of
redshift.

3.3 21-cm signatures around the ﬁrst stars and their

SN remnants

The high sensitivity and angular resolution of SKA will allow
us to investigate the 21-cm signal around ﬁrst stars. In Yajima
& Li (2014), we have calculated the 21-cm structure by using
radiative transfer simulations that include ionization of hydro-
gen and resonant scattering of Lyα photons. A striking feature
of this work compared to other studies shown in §2.5 is to solve
Lyα radiative transfer that estimates number of scatterings of
Lyα photons for considering the WF effect precisely, leading to
more appropriate evaluation of the 21-cm spin temperature. Our
models are based on one-dimensional spherical shells with the
H ∼ 2× 10−7(1 + z)3 cm−3. We fol-
uniform IGM density nIGM
low the time-evolving structures of ionization, temperature and
radiation ﬁeld of the central ﬁrst stars, and then estimate the
spin temperature and the 21-cm signal. Although the life time
of ﬁrst stars is ∼ several Myr, our calculations follow the time
evolution until 108 yr considering continuous star formation of
multiple stars.

The left panel of Fig. 7 shows the simulated 21-cm signal
around ﬁrst stars with Mstar = 200 M⊙ at z = 10. The differ-
ential brightness temperature shows the ring-like structure tran-
siting from a positive value to a negative one. The central hole
represents almost completely ionized regions. The high-energy
photons from ﬁrst stars produce the large transition area from
ionized to neutral regions where the gas temperature is higher
than the CMB temperature. Due to strong Lyα radiation from
halos, the spin temperature in the transition area is coupled to

the gas temperature. As a result, the transition area shows an
emission signal. The absorption signal, which represents the
cold neutral region, becomes weaker as the radial distance in-
creases. We also calculate the 21-cm signal around galaxies and
quasars of which the shape of SED and the stellar mass are dif-
ferent. The feature of 21-cm signal of QSOs (right panel) is
similar to that of the ﬁrst stars, but the size of the 21-cm signal
is much bigger due to higher luminosity. On the other hand, the
21-cm signal of galaxies (central panel) shows the small emis-
sion signal region due to lower high-energy photon ﬂux ratio.
We ﬁnd that the peak positions of the emission and absorption
signals around the ﬁrst stars (Mstar = 200 M⊙) are r = 10.0 kpc
(δTb = 28.0 mK) and r = 50.1 kpc (δTb = −2.5 mK) at t = 106
yr, then move to r = 17.8 kpc (δTb = 27.7 mK) and r = 85.8
kpc (δTb = −70.1 mK) at t = 107 yr.

The detailed structure of the 21-cm signal cannot be re-
solved even by the SKA. Hence, we estimate hδTi by making
the coarse-grained images of the 21-cm signals with the radius
where |δTb| becomes less than 1 mK. If the UV background is
not strong and the separation distance of halos is much larger
than the angular resolution, SKA will be able to resolve the
rough position of ﬁrst stars. The detectability of the 21-cm sig-
nal around ﬁrst stars, galaxies and QSOs are shown in Fig. 8.
Different symbols represent the results of the different stellar
masses. The yellow shade regions show the sensitivity curves
of the telescopes with the effective correct areas of 104, 105 and
106 m2, and their lower and upper lines represent the integra-
tion time of 1000 and 10000 hours, respectively. The size ∆θ
increases with the stellar mass and the size of HII bubbles. At
z = 10, Pop III stars show hδTi ∼ 5 − 12 mK, while galaxies
have hδTi∼ 19−584 mK and QSOs have hδTi∼ 28−196 mK.
We suggest that the 21-cm signal around the cluster of ﬁrst stars
with Mstar ∼ 104 M⊙ at z = 10 can be detected by SKA1-low
with an integration time of ∼ 1000 hours.

First stars cause supernovae (SNe) at their death because ﬁrst
stars can be enough massive. Therefore, SNe of ﬁrst stars are

expected as observational signature of ﬁrst stars. In particular,
ﬁrst stars in the mass range 140 M⊙ < M < 260 M⊙ explode as
pair-instability SNe, which are up to 100 times more energetic
than typical Type Ia and Type II SNe (Heger & Woosley 2010).
Many authors have studies the detectability of such energetic
SNe at the EoR (Moriya et al. 2010; Tanaka et al. 2012; Whalen
et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2014; Smidt et al. 2015). and concluded
that these SNe could be detected by future high redshift surveys
including JWST (Gardner et al. 2006) and EUCLID (Laureijs
et al. 2011).

SNe of ﬁrst stars can imprint observable signatures on red-
shifted 21-cm maps. SN remnants produce X-ray photons
which efﬁciently heat up their surroundings. As a result, the
spin temperature of IGM near SNe of ﬁrst stars decouples from
the CMB temperature and the observable signals due to SNe in
redshifted 21-cm maps are created. We have investigated the
21 cm signal around a SN of a ﬁrst star, using a simple analyt-
ical model of a SN remnant. As the evolution of the SN rem-
nant, we adopt the Sedov-Taylor solution with SN energy ESN.
The Sedov-Taylor solution is a solution in adiabatic phase.
However, the remnant is cooled through the Compton scattering
with CMB photons. The time scale of the Compton cooling is
CMB ∼ 1.4× 107[(1 + z)/20]−4 yr.
given by tC = 3mec/4σT aT 4
The energy of the remnant is totally lost by the Compton cool-
ing when t∼ tC. In the propagation of a SN remnant through the
ambient medium, electron acceleration to relativistic velocities
and magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation occur. In order to evaluate the
relativistic electron number density and magnetic ﬁeld ampli-
tude in a SN remnant, we introduce the fractions of the SN en-
ergy into relativistic electrons (frel) and magnetic ﬁelds (fmag).
In the presence of magnetic ﬁelds and relativistic electrons, X-
ray photons are produced through the synchrotron radiation. We
calculate the luminosity through the synchrotron radiation from
the SN remnant of a ﬁrst stars with ESN = 1053 erg, frel = 0.01
and fmag = 0.01. We show the luminosity integrated over the

timated in the spherical top-hat beam with the size of the distance from the

mean δTb of the lowest stellar masses for each source at z = 20. The yellow

with the effective collect areas of 104, 105 and 106 m2, while its width cor-
responds to the integration time from 100 to 1000 hours with ∆ν = 1 MHz.

We also investigate the ionization and the heating of sur-
rounding IGM by the X-ray photons from a SN remnant. As
described in §2.2, X-ray photons can ionize the IGM at a dis-
tance of several kpc, and heat the IGM up to Mpc. We show
the resultant 21-cm signals due to the ﬁrst star SN in the bot-
tom panel of Fig. 9. The size of the detectable signal for the
redshifted 21-cm lines also reaches a several comoving Mpc
scales. For example, the SKA noise level is roughly 50 mK at
z ∼ 20 with 1000 hours integration. The radius of the sphere
with |δT| ∼ 50 mK is 3 comoving Mpc, whose angular scale
is ∼ 3′. Therefore, SKA might be able to resolve the 21-cm
signals due to the SN of a ﬁrst star.

3.4 21-cm forest
As described in §2.6, the 21-cm forest is an radio analogue to
the Lyα forest, that is, systems of narrow absorption lines due
to intervening, cold neutral intergalactic medium or collapsed
structures against high-z radio loud sources. An advantage of
the 21-cm forest compared to the Lyα forest is its smaller opti-
cal depth that enables us to probe higher redshifts z > 6. The 21-
cm absorption lines are mainly created by small scale structures

a function of optical depth against 21-cm line (τ ), per redshift interval at
z=10 (top) and z=20 (bottom) in the WDM cosmology for several DM masses
as indicated. WDM with smaller mass erases density ﬂuctuations on larger
length scales, leading to less abundance of the absorber. Taken from Fig. 10
in Shimabukuro et al. (2014). “Probing small-scale cosmological ﬂuctuations
with the 21 cm forest: Effects of neutrino mass, running spectral index, and

such as ﬁlaments and mini-halos in the IGM, and the number of
the lines strongly depends on the thermal state of the IGM and
the number of mini-halos. Therefore, the 21-cm forest can be a
powerful probe to the EoR and the nature of density ﬂuctuations
on the corresponding scales of mini-halos.

Using the ability of the 21-cm forest to see through a high-
redshift universe, Shimabukuro et al. (2014) show that the 21-
cm forest can be used to probe the power spectrum of density
ﬂuctuations on small sales k >
∼ 10 Mpc−1 (comoving) that other
cosmological probes can not reach. Using an analytic model by
Furlanetto & Loeb (2002), we predict the number of absorption
lines as a function of optical depth in cosmologies somewhat
beyond the simplest ΛCDM model. As a speciﬁc example, we
consider the effects of ﬁnite neutrino mass, running spectral in-
dex and WDM on the power spectrum. In particular, it is shown
that the 21-cm forest is sensitive at the WDM mass range of
mWDM >

ber of absorption lines per redshift interval in models with dif-
ferent WDM masses. The free streaming effect of lighter WDM
erases density ﬂuctuations on larger scales leading to less mini-
halos, and therefore the number of absorption lines decreases
with decreasing WDM mass. Because the 21-cm forest is cre-
ated dominantly by mini-halos on smaller scales than the Lyα
forest can probe, it is sensitive to lighter WDM masses.

Whereas the 21-cm forest observation would offer a power-
ful probe to the EoR and cosmology, the most challenging issue
of the detection of a 21-cm forest is the existence of radio loud
sources at high redshifts. Since we can expect that the number
of the absorber reaches a maximum around τ ≈ 0.01 as shown
in Fig. 10, we need to detect absorption lines with τ >
∼ 0.01 to
use the 21-cm forest for a cosmological purpose, The number of
the QSO sources whose ﬂux is larger than the detection thresh-
old of an absorption line with τ ≈ 0.01 is expected as <
∼ 100 in
the whole sky at z = 10, assuming a integration time of 10 hours
and the SKA2 sensitivity (Ciardi et al. 2015b). Another candi-
date for the background radio source is the radio afterglows of
GRBs arising from Pop III stars (Ciardi et al. 2015a). In any
case, if a sufﬁciently bright radio source was found at a high
redshift the absorption lines should be easily detected with the
SKA, because nagging foregrounds are not a concern for ob-
serving the 21-cm forest.

3.5 The effect of supersonic streaming motion on

structure formation

As described in §2.2, the supersonic streaming motion between
baryons and CDM suppresses a halo abundance on small scales,

Fig. 12. The ratio of DM halo abundance between with and without consid-
ering the delay of the halo formation by the supersonic streaming motions
at z = 10 (red), z = 15 (green), z = 20 (blue) and z = 30 (magenta) as
a function of the DM halo mass. Taken form Fig. 11 in Asaba et al. 2016.
“Effect of supersonic relative motion between baryons and dark matter on
collapsed objects”, Asaba, S., Ichiki, K., Tashiro, H. 2016, Phys. Rev. D, 93,

and impacts the reionization history via modiﬁcations of star
formation processes. However, the detailed process of the sup-
pression has not been understood sufﬁciently.

In Asaba et al. (2016), we investigated the effect of the
streaming motion on the formation of DM halos in the context
of the spherical collapse model. We performed N-body sim-
ulations of the collapse of an isolated DM halo in a uniform
background density, taking the streaming motion into account
by giving the coherent relative velocity to one-sixth (≈ Ωb/Ωm)
of the background particles. Fig. 11 shows the time evolution
of the sizes of DM halos with relative velocity vbc = 30 km/s.
For comparison, we also plot the solutions of a semi-analytical
model given by

G(Mc,i + Mb)

Mb =

c(1 + δb).

(8)

When we solve the above equations, Mb is estimated from a N-
body simulation result so as to consider the effect of the stream-
ing motion. Fig. 11 tells us that the collapse time of DM halos
is delayed by the streaming motion and is more remarkable on
smaller mass scales. Moreover, the comparison with the semi-
analytic solution illustrates that the delay due to the streaming
motion is related to the decrease in the baryon mass. The degree
of the delay depends on not only the halo mass and the ampli-
tude of the relative velocity but the collapse epoch of the halo
in the absence of the streaming motion.

It is convenient if we have a simple manner in which the in-
ﬂuence of the streaming motions is taken into account. We have
ﬁrstly modiﬁed the Press-Schechter formalism to consider the

Japan SKA Consortium (2016)

abundance of DM halos affected by the streaming motions. In
the modiﬁed formalism, the delay of the collapse time is con-
sidered by changing the value of the critical density ˜δcrit, and
the mass function is given by

where f (vbc) is the probability function of the amplitude of the
relative velocity between baryons and DM at cosmic recombi-
nation. Fig. 12 shows the ratio of halo abundances between with
and without the supersonic streaming motions. We ﬁnd the halo
abundance with M ≤ 108 M⊙/h is suppressed by the stream-
ing motions and, in particular, the halo abundance on mass scale
M ∼ 105 M⊙/h decreases by 80% (z = 30) and a half (z = 10).
It is expected that this suppression of the halo abundance alters
the reionizaiton history and affects the 21-cm forest signal pro-
duced by minihalos. Therefore we should involve the effect of
the streaming motion to simulate the 21-cm signals accurately.

4 Summary

The SKA will be a powerful instrument for exploring the
CD/EoR Science in the nest decade. As described in this arti-
cle, observational quantities expected to be detected by the SKA
involves fruitful information on the properties of astronomical
objects causing reionization as well as the cosmic reionization
process itself . The studies by SKA-Japan Consortium members
shown in §3 have already contributed to the CD/EoR Science
with the SKA, but further international collaborations will be
valuable in modeling of reionization and in understanding the
physical processes in the EoR.
