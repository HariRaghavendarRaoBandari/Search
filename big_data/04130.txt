Abstract

We use the connection between bond percolation and SIR epidemics to establish lower bounds
for the critical percolation probability in 2 and 3 dimensions as the range becomes large. The bound
agrees with the conjectured asymptotics for the long range critical probability, reﬁnes results of
M. Penrose, and complements results of van der Hofstad and Sakai in dimensions greater than 6.

1 Introduction

1.1 Range-R bond percolation
We study the critical probability in range-R bond percolation. For a parameter R ∈ N called the
range, deﬁne Zd/R = {x/R : x ∈ Zd}. We construct an undirected graph Zd
R with vertex set Zd/R
denotes the ℓ∞
and assign edges between two vertices x, y ∈ Zd/R if 0 < kx − yk∞ ≤ 1, where k·k∞
norm on Rd. Write x ∼ y if there exists an edge between x and y in Zd/R, let N (x) denote the set of
neighbours of x, and denote its size by

V (R) := |N (x)| = |{y ∈ Zd/R, y ∼ 0 : 0 < kyk∞ ≤ 1}| = (2R + 1)d − 1 ,

where |S| denotes the cardinality of a ﬁnite set S. Let E(Zd
R. The
structure of this graph is unchanged if one scales the lattice so that the vertex set is Zd and there are
edges between points x, y ∈ Zd when 0 < kx − yk∞ ≤ R, but for the remainder of this paper we shall
focus solely on the graph Zd
R for d ≤ 3. If x ∼ y, we let (x, y) or (y, x) denote the edge between x and
y.

We construct a random, undirected subgraph G = GR with vertex set Zd

R by considering a collection
of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables {B(e) : e ∈ E(Zd
R)}, each with parameter p > 0. An edge e is open
iﬀ B(e) = 1, while edges with B(e) = 0 are closed. G is the resulting subgraph with edge set equalling
the set of open edges. Two vertices x and y in Zd
R are connected if there is a path between x and y
consisting of open edges; we denote this event by x ↔ y. Let λ = V (R)p > 0 denote the mean number
of neighbours in G of any vertex. The cluster Cx in G containing x is

Cx := {y ∈ Zd/R : x ↔ y},

and the percolation probability, q(p), is denoted by

The critical probability is deﬁned by

q(p) = Pp(|C0| = ∞).

and the associated critical value of λ is

pc = pc(R) := inf{p : q(p) > 0} ,

λc = λc(R) := pc(R)V (R) .

The obvious monotonicity in p shows that q(p) = 0 for p ∈ [0, pc) and q(p) > 0 for p ∈ (pc, 1]. M.
Penrose [13] showed that

(1.1)

λc(R) = 1 .

lim
R→∞

If we view the set of vertices distance n in the G-graph distance from the origin as a set-valued
“interactive branching process” ηn, then for R large and λ bounded, ηn should be well-approximated
by an ordinary Galton-Watson branching process with oﬀspring mean λ. This is because with so many
potential percolation steps from generation n to n + 1, it is unlikely that the process will take a step
to a previously visited site. As a result one expects the critical mean λc(R) to be close to 1, the
critical mean for the GW branching process. (This intuition is of course well-known and was pointed
by Penrose, among others.) Write a(R) ∼ b(R) iﬀ the ratio approaches 1 as R → ∞. Van der Hofstad
and Sakai [6] have obtained ﬁner asymptotics on λc(R) for d > 6 using the lace expansion:

(1.2)

λc(R) − 1 ∼

θd
Rd

where θd has an explicit expression in terms of a random walk with uniform steps on [−1, 1]d. The
extension of (1.2) to d ≥ 4 (with logarithmic corrections in d = 4) is the subject of ongoing work of one
of us [EP] with Xinghua Zheng. In the next subsection we recall a parallel conjecture (Conjecture 1.4)
for d = 2, 3 suggested in Lalley-Perkins-Zheng [10]. Our main result (Theorem 1.5 below) is a lower
bound on λc(R) which conﬁrms the conjecture aside from the constant. The ﬁrst step is to make the
above connection between bond percolation and “interactive branching processes” more precise in the
next subsection.

1.2 SIR epidemic models and bond percolation

We recall a well-known connection between bond percolation and an epidemic model which dates back
at least to [12]. For the SIR epidemic model on Zd
R, each vertex x ∈ Zd/R can be in one of three
possible states: we denote x ∈ ξn if x is susceptible at time n; x ∈ ηn if x is infected at time n; and
x ∈ ρn if x is recovered at time n. Each vertex x is in exactly one of the three states, so that for each
time n,

Zd/R = ξn ˙∪ηn ˙∪ρn .

2

The epidemic starts from ﬁnite initial conﬁgurations of infected sites, η0, and recovered sites, ρ0. An
infected site x ∈ ηn infects a susceptible neighbour y ∈ ξn, y ∼ x, with probability p = p(R), where
the infection events are conditionally independent given the current conﬁguration of states. Infected
sites are infected for unit time, after which they become recovered, and recovered sites are immune
from infection, so that if x ∈ ηn, then x ∈ ρk for all k ≥ n + 1. Note that
ρn = ρ0 ˙∪η0 ˙∪ . . . ˙∪ηn−1, and is ﬁnite for all n.
(1.3)

We let

(1.4)

∂Cn := {e = (x, y) ∈ E(Zd

R) : x ∈ ηn, y ∈ ξn}

be the set of possible infection edges leading to ηn+1, where in describing edges (x, y) in ∂Cn we
will use the convention that the ﬁrst coordinate refers to the site in ηn. So that for any given edges
(xi, yi), i ≤ m, the event ∂Cn = {(xi, yi) : i ≤ m} will include this speciﬁcation. (This amounts to
choosing a particular representative for an equivalence class in our notation.) Let Fn = σ(ρ0, ηk, k ≤ n).
Clearly the ﬁnite random set ∂Cn is σ(ηn, ρn) ⊂ Fn-measurable because ξn = (ηn ∪ ρn)c. If y is a site
in Zd

R, let

(1.5)

Dn(y) = {x ∈ ηn : (x, y) ∈ ∂Cn}.

If S = {(xi, yi) : i ≤ m} is a set of distinct edges in Zd
description implies that

R and V ⊂ {yi : i ≤ m} := V2, then the above

(1.6)

P(ηn+1 = V |Fn) = Yy∈V2\V

(1 − p)|Dn(y)| Yy∈V

[1 − (1 − p)|Dn(y)|] a.s. on {∂Cn = S}.

Clearly (1.6) and the joint law of (η0, ρ0) uniquely determines the law of the SIR epidemic η. Since
ρn+1 = ρn ∪ ηn, (1.6) also gives the (time-homogeneous) Markov property of (ηn, ρn):
(1.7)

P((ηn+1, ρn+1) ∈ · (cid:12)(cid:12)Fn) = P((ηn+1, ρn+1) ∈ · (cid:12)(cid:12)ηn, ρn) = Pηn,ρn ((η1, ρ1) ∈ ·) ,

where Pη0,ρ0 is the law of (η, ρ) starting at (η0, ρ0), whenever (η0, ρ0) are disjoint ﬁnite sets of sites.
Unless otherwise indicated we will assume the SIR epidemic under P starts from η0 = {0} and ρ0 = ∅,
and assume p = p(R), is such that

λ(R) := p(R)V (R) ≥ 1.
We may use the edge percolation variables {B(e) : e ∈ E(Zd
R)} from the last section to deﬁne the
infection dynamics of η as follows: Every infected–susceptible pair (x, y) ∈ ∂Cn has a successful
infection iﬀ B(x, y) = 1. The dynamics of the SIR epidemic force each bond variable B(x, y) to be
used at most once in deﬁning the epidemic process, precisely when x is infected and y is susceptible or
conversely. The fact that the above speciﬁcation of the infection dynamics leads to (1.6) and hence
deﬁnes an SIR epidemic, is immediate from Lemma 2.1 below.

We collect the dynamics here:

(1.8)

{y ∈ ξn : B(x, y) = 1},

ηn+1 = [x∈ηn
ρn+1 = ρn ∪ ηn,
ξn+1 = ξn \ ηn.

Let dG(x, y) denotes the graph distance in the percolation graph, G, between x, y ∈ Zd
R (it may be
inﬁnite), and similarly let dG(A, x) denote the distance in G between a set of vertices A and x ∈ Zd
R.
An easy induction (see below) shows that if (η0, ρ0) = ({0},∅), then for n ∈ Z+, ηn = {x ∈ Zd
R :
dG(0, x) = n}. More generally for a given pair of disjoint ﬁnite sets of sites in Zd
R, (η0, ρ0), let G(ρ0) be

3

the percolation graph but where all edges containing a vertex in ρ0 are closed. Then for (η, ρ) starting
at (η0, ρ0),

(1.9)

ηn = {x ∈ Zd

R : dG(ρ0)(η0, x) = n} := ηη0,ρ0

n

.

We present the inductive argument for the above. If n = 0, this is obvious. Assume the result for n.
0 and there is an x′ ∈ ηn such that B(x′, x) = 1.
Assume ﬁrst x ∈ ηn+1. Then by (1.8), x ∈ ξn ⊂ ρc
By hypothesis, dG(ρ0)(η0, x′) = n. Since x′ /∈ ρ0 (or else the above distance would be ∞) this implies
that dG(ρ0)(η0, x) ≤ n + 1. As x /∈ ∪k≤nηk = ρn ∪ ηn (x ∈ ξn is disjoint from this union by (1.8)), the
induction hypothesis imples dG(ρ0)(η0, x) > n and so dG(ρ0)(η0, x) = n + 1. Conversely assume that
dG(ρ0)(η0, x) = n + 1. This again implies x 6∈ ρ0. There is an x′ /∈ ρ0 so that dG(ρ0)(η0, x′) = n, x′ ∼ x
and B(x′, x) = 1. By hypothesis x′ ∈ ηn. Also by the induction hypothesis x 6∈ ∪n
k=1ηk = ρn ∪ ηn (or
else dG(ρ0)(η0, x) ≤ n). This means x must be in ξn and so by (1.8) we conclude that x ∈ ηn+1. This
completes the induction.
Here is one simple consequence of the coupling of initial conditions that comes from this construc-

tion. It will be used in Section 3.
Lemma 1.1. For any disjoint ﬁnite sets η0, ρ0 ⊂ Zd
(a) Pη0,ρ0(| ∪n
(b) Eη0,∅(|ρn|) ≤ |η0|E{0},∅(|ρn|).
Proof. (a) Clearly dG(ρ0)(η0, x) ≤ n implies dG(η0, x) ≤ n, since the former gives the existence of a
chain of at most n open bonds in G starting at a vertex in η0 and ending at x with the additional
property that each vertex is not in ρ0, and this clearly implies the latter. The result is now immediate
from the characterization of ηn given in (1.9).
(b) As we are dealing with coupled versions of ρn all starting at ρ0 = ∅ but with diﬀerent η0’s, we let
n = ∪n−1

n = {y ∈ Zd

R : dG(η0, y) < n} = ∪x∈η0{y ∈ Zd

R : dG(x, y) < n},

the last by an elementary argument. This shows that |ρη0
may conclude that

n | ≤ Px∈η0 |ρ{x}n |, and so taking means we

Eη0,∅(|ρn|) ≤ Xx∈η0

E{x},∅(|ρn|) = |η0|E{0},∅(|ρn|).

The last equality follows from translation invariance of the dynamics of η.

We say that an epidemic survives if with positive probability, for all n ∈ N, we have ηn 6= ∅. If
with probability one, for some ﬁnite n we have ηn = ∅, we say the epidemic becomes extinct.
If we have survival of the epidemic, then with positive probability there is an inﬁnite sequence of
sites xk such that xk ∈ ηk, xk ∼ xk−1, and xk−1 infected xk at time k, and hence the edge B(xk−1, xk)
is open. This implies that with positive probability, we have percolation from η0 = {0} to inﬁnity in
range-R bond percolation. Likewise, percolation from η0 to inﬁnity in the percolation model induces
an inﬁnite sequence of infections and hence survival in the epidemic. In this way, percolation to inﬁnity
is equivalent to survival of the analogous SIR epidemic on the same graph.

To understand the large R behaviour of pc(R) we will ﬁx a parameter θ > 0, rescale our model by
Rγ , and work with the empirical process of the

δx/(R√Rγ ).

Rγ Xx∈η⌊tRγ ⌋

We ﬁrst have resealed the range to size 1 and then applied the usual Brownian scaling due to the
time rescaling by Rγt. We will assume θ ≤ 1 which implies that p ∈ (0, 1).
In the above γ > 0
must be chosen carefully if we want to obtain an interesting limit. For example, if γ is too small,

6−d , and for appropriate {X R

0 }, X R

K is the space of C2 functions from Rd to R with compact support, and

then the range R = (Rγ)1/γ will be too large relative to the scaling parameter Rγ and the eﬀect
of suppressing infections onto recovered sites will become negligible. As a result we will recover the
scaling limit of branching random walk, super-Brownian motion. The “correct” choice, taken from
Lalley and Zheng [11] (see below), is γ = 2d
6−d (so that for d = 2, 3, Rγ = Rd−1 ∈ N if R ∈ N). Let ⇒
denote weak convergence on the appropriate space, MF (Rd) be the space of ﬁnite Borel measures on
Rd with the topology of weak convergence, and µ(f ) denote the integral R f dµ of a function f with
respect to a measure µ. C2
D([0,∞), MF (Rd)) is the Skorohod space of cadlag MF (Rd)-valued paths.
Conjecture 1.2. Assume d ≤ 3, γ = 2d
0 ⇒ X0, for a compactly
supported ﬁxed ﬁnite measure X0. Then X R ⇒ X in D([0,∞), MF (Rd)) as R → ∞. The limit X is
the unique solution to the martingale problem
(1.10) Xt(φ) =Z φdXt = X0(φ) + Mt(φ) +Z t
where X is a continuous MF (Rd)-valued process, Ls is the local time of X, i.e., satisﬁesR t
R Lt(x)ψ(x)dx, and M (φ) is a continuous martingale with hM (φ)it =R t
The “appropriate” {X R

0 } are those satisfying the regularity condition (17) in Theorem 2 of Lalley
and Zheng [11]. That result establishes a weak convergence result which is very close to the above.
Instead of Zd
R, they work with a “village model” on Zd × {1, . . . , N} where sites (x, m) and (y, n) are
neighbours iﬀ x and y are nearest neighbours in Zd, or x = y and m 6= n. The rescaling parameter
in Theorem 2 of [11] is N 2/(6−d). Equating N and Rd so that the number of neighbours in the two
models are of the same order of magnitude, leads to the scaling parameter Rγ chosen above. Xinghua
Zheng in fact has proved the above Conjecture for d = 2 [private communication].

The well-posedness of the above martingale problem is established, for example, in Theorem 2.2 of
Lalley, Perkins, and Zheng [10] who also showed that for d = 2, 3, there is a phase transition in (1.10):

Theorem 1.3. Let d = 2 or d = 3. There exists a θc = θc(d) > 0 such that for all nonzero ﬁnite
measures X0,

a. for θ < θc, X becomes extinct.

b. for θ > θc, X survives (with positive probability).

If d = 1, then for all θ and all ﬁnite X0, X becomes extinct.

(Although percolation fails trivially for any R and p < 1 in d = 1, there is some work to do to
show this for the one-dimensional continuous model in the above.) For d = 2, 3, a formal interchange
of limits in t and R in the above results, and the equality 2d
6−d = d − 1 for d = 2, 3, leads us to the
following reﬁnement of M. Penrose’s result (1.1):
Conjecture 1.4. For d = 2 or 3, V (R)pc(R) − 1 ∼ θc

Rd−1 .

(The analogue of the above for the “village model” described above is raised in Section 2.2 of Lalley,

Perkins, and Zheng [10].) Simulations carried out by Deshin Finlay [5] suggest that

V (R)pc(R) − 1 ∼(1.2/R,

.7/R2,

if d = 2,
if d = 3.

The conjecture really should be made with 2d
6−d in place of d − 1 even though they are equal for
the relevant values of d. For example, putting d = 4 into the former formula is consistent with the
conjectured behaviour in the critical d = 4 case cited above (albeit with logarithmic corrections in R).

5

The similarity with the critical infection rate of the long range contact process is discussed in
Section 1.5 of [10]. Our d ≤ 3 setting corresponds to the d = 1 setting of the long range contact
process where the conjecture corresponding to Conjecture 1.4 remains unresolved (see the Conjecture
following Theorem 2 in Durrett and Perkins [4]). In the contact process setting, however, upper and
lower bounds establishing the correct rate of convergence (if not the exact constant) were established
in Theorem 1 of Bramson, Durrett and Swindle [2]. Our main result, which adapts some of the nice
ideas in the 1-dimensional lower bound from [2], is a lower bound on pc(R), consistent with the rate
in Conjecture 1.4:
Theorem 1.5. For d = 2, 3 there is a constant θ = θ(d) > 0, such that for all R ∈ N

V (R)pc(R) − 1 ≥

θ
Rd−1 .

For the village model described above, independent work of E. Neuman and X. Zheng (in prepa-
ration) shows an analogue of the above result and a companion upper bound for pc, using diﬀerent
methods.

In Section 2 we gather some results on the SIR epidemic ηn and an associated branching random
walk (BRW) Zn. In Subsection 2.1 we give a more careful derivation of the connection between bond
percolation and ηn (Lemma 2.1), and use it to derive an expression on the conditional increments of
|ηn|, Corollary 2.2. In Subsection 2.2 we couple η with a dominating BRW Z and in Subsection 2.3 we
establish an upper bound on the probability that Z exits a large ball by generation n. The latter is
classical (and goes back at least to Dawson-Iscoe-Perkins [3]) aside from the fact that the long range
structure of the BRW means there is an additional parameter going to inﬁnity. The changes needed to
derive this result from the arguments in Section 4 of [3] is presented in an Appendix. In Section 3 we
will use Corollary 2.2 and the above upper bound on the dominating BRW to show that for some ﬁxed
θ > 0 and R satisfying V (R)p(R)− 1 ≥ θ
Rd−1 there is some k so that E(|ηk|) < 1 (Proposition 3.1). We
will then show, essentially by a comparison to subcritical branching (thanks in part to Lemma 1.1),
that this gives a.s. extinction of η. In view of our assumption on λ(R) this implies the lower bound
on λc(R).

2 Preliminary Results

In this section and for the remainder of the paper, we will consider an SIR epidemic η on Zd
or 3, and choose the probability of infection p = p(R), so that for a ﬁxed θ ∈ (0, 1],
(2.1)

λ(R) = V (R)p(R) = 1 + θ/Rd−1 .

2.1 The Increments of ηn

Throughout this subsection we assume our initial condition (η0, ρ0) is a ﬁxed (deterministic) pair of
disjoint ﬁnite sets of vertices. For each edge (x, y) ∈ E(Zd

R), let

n(x, y) = inf{ℓ ≥ 1 : x ∈ ηℓ−1 and y ∈ ξℓ−1, or x ∈ ξℓ−1 and y ∈ ηℓ−1} .

(By convention, inf ∅ = ∞). Then n(e) is the unique exploration time of the edge e when B(e) is
used to deﬁne ηn (and n(e) = ∞ means that the edge is never used in the deﬁnition of η). Clearly
n(e) = n + 1 iﬀ e = (x, y) ∈ ∂Cn, and so n(e) is a predictable Fn-stopping time, i.e., the events
{n(e) = n + 1} are Fn-measurable.

For e ∈ E(Zd

R), deﬁne

(2.2)

Vn(e) =(B(e),

2,

if e ∈ ∂Cn−1,
if e 6∈ ∂Cn−1.

6

Then x ∈ ηn if and only if there exists a sequence of points x0, . . . , xn = x such that x0 ∈ η0, xk /∈ ρ0
for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and Vk(xk−1, xk) = 1 for all k = 1, . . . , n.
In this way, V1, . . . , Vn describe the
epidemic in terms of the geometry of the percolation substructure. We deﬁne

¯Fn = σ(V1, . . . , Vn) .

It is clear from the above that Fn ⊂ ¯Fn, and it is not hard to see that this inclusion is strict (although
this will not be needed).
Lemma 2.1. (a) For any ﬁnite set of edges S = {(xi, yi) : i ≤ m} in Zd

P(B(e) = 1 ∀e ∈ S, B(e′) = 0 ∀e′ ∈ S \ S | ¯Fn)

= p(R)|S|(1 − p(R))|S\S| a. s. on the ¯Fn-measurable set {∂Cn = S}.

(b) If x ∼ y, then
(2.4)

Proof. (a) Let Ak : E(Zd

P(B(x, y) = 1 | ¯Fn) = p(R) on the ¯Fn-measurable set {x ∈ ηn, y ∈ ξn}.

R) → {0, 1, 2}, k = 1, . . . , n + 1, be ﬁxed functions such that each set
Sk := {e ∈ E(Zd

R) : Ak(e) 6= 2},

k = 1, . . . , n + 1,

is ﬁnite. (There are countably many such functions.) Since ¯Fn = σ(Vk, k ≤ n), it suﬃces to show that

P(B(e) = 1 ∀e ∈ S, B(e′) = 0 ∀e′ ∈ S \ S, ∂Cn = S, (Vk)k≤n = (Ak)k≤n)
= P(B(e) = 1 ∀e ∈ S, B(e′) = 0 ∀e′ ∈ S \ S) · P(∂Cn = S, (Vk)k≤n = (Ak)k≤n)

(2.5)
The required result then follows by the independence of the {B(e) : e ∈ E(Zd/R)} and the deﬁnition
of conditional probability.

For simplicity of notation, let

C = {∂Cn = S, Vk = Ak, k ≤ n}.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that C is non-empty. On the event ∩n
k=1{Vk = Ak}, we
know that ∂Ck−1 = Sk for each k = 1, . . . , n, since Vk(e′) is {0, 1}-valued only on edges e′ ∈ ∂Ck−1,
and is otherwise equal to 2. Moreover, on C we have n(e) = n + 1 for all e ∈ S, and hence the sets

S1, . . . , Sn, S

are a collection of n + 1 mutually disjoint sets. Denote S(n) = ∪k≤nSk. On ∩n
k=1{Vk = Ak}, for all 1 ≤
k ≤ n, x ∈ ηk iﬀ there is an (x′, x) ∈ Sk such that Ak(x′, x) = 1 (since on this set Ak(x′, x) = B(x′, x)).
Since y ∈ ξn iﬀ y /∈ ρ0 ∪ (∪n
k=1{Vk = Ak}, we have y ∈ ξn iﬀ y /∈ ρ0 and
for all k ≤ n there is no (y′, y) ∈ Sk such that Ak(y′, y) = 1. This shows that on ∩n

k=0ηk), this means that on ∩n

k=1{Vk = Ak},

∂Cn = {(x, y) : x ∼ y, y /∈ ρ0,∃(x′, x) ∈ Sn s.t. An(x′, x) = 1,

and ∀k ≤ n there is no (y′, y) ∈ Sk s.t. Ak(y′, y) = 1}

=: S′n+1.

Therefore

k=1{Vk = Ak} =(∩n
k=1{Vk = Ak} ∩ {An+1(e) = B(e) ∀e ∈ Sn+1},
∩n+1
∅,

if Sn+1 = S′n+1,
if Sn+1 6= S′n+1.

k=1{Vk = Ak} ∈ σ(B(e) : e ∈ S(n)). Also since C 6= ∅ we
The obvious induction now shows that ∩n
must have S = S′n+1 and so C = ∩n
k=1{Vk = Ak} ∈ σ(B(e) : e ∈ S(n)). Since S ∩ S(n) is empty, and
distinct edges have independent Bernoulli variables, (2.5) is now immediate, and (a) is proved.
(b) Let S be as in (a) and containing the edge (x, y). Now sum the result in (a) over all ¯S as in (a)
with (x, y) ∈ ¯S and S ﬁxed. A simple application of the binomial theorem will give the conclusion of
(b) on the set {∂Cn = S}. Finally take the union over these events where (x, y) ∈ S to derive (b).

2.2 Coupling with a branching envelope
Throughout this subsection we assume our initial condition (η0, ρ0) = ({0},∅). As in Lalley-Zheng [11],
we may couple a copy of η with a dominating branching random walk in our long range setting. To see
this, label potential particles in the branching random walk by I = ∪∞n=0N (0)n, where N (0)0 = {∅}.
It will be convenient to totally order N (0) as {e1, e2, . . . , eV (R)} and then totally order each N (0)n
lexicographically by <. For α = (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ N (0)n ⊂ I, write |α| = n, α|i = (α1, . . . , αi) for
1 ≤ i ≤ n (|∅| = 0), and πα = (α1, . . . , αn−1) be the parent of α, where if n = 1 the parent is the root
index ∅. Concatenation in I is denoted by (α1, . . . , αn) ∨ (β1, . . . , βm) = (α1, . . . , αn, β1, . . . , βm). Let
{Bα : α ∈ I \ {∅}} be an iid collection of Bernoulli random variables with P(Bα = 1) = 1 − P(Bα =
0) = p(R), and set Gn = σ({Bα : |α| ≤ n}). The intuition is that each α ∈ I with |α| = n labels
a potential individual in generation n and Cα = {e : Bα∨e = 1} are the locations of the children
of α relative to the position of the parent, α. Let M α = |Cα| be the number of children of α, so
that {M α : α ∈ I} is a collection of independent binomial (V (R), p(R)) random variables. Moreover
{M α : |α| = n} is jointly independent of Gn. So for n ≥ 1, each α ∈ I with |α| = n labels an individual
alive in generation n iﬀ Bα|i = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, in which case we write α ≈ n. Note that ∅ ≈ 0
always and for |α| = n,

{ω : α ≈ n} ∈ Gn.

If for each α ∈ I,

Y α =(P|α|i=1 αi ∈ Zd/R if α ≈ |α|

otherwise,

∆

then Y α is the location of the particle α if it is alive, and is set to the cemetery state, ∆, otherwise.

In this way Zn = Pα≈n δY α (n ≥ 0) deﬁnes the empirical distribution of a branching random walk

(BRW) in which each individual in generation n produces a binomial (V (R), p(R)) number (M α) of

8

children whose positions, relative to their parent and given σ(M α : |α| = n) ∨ Gn, are uniformly
distributed over

N (0)(M α) = {(e′1, . . . , e′M α ) : e′i ∈ N (0), e′1, . . . , e′M α distinct}.

Note that conditional on σ(M α : |α| = n) ∨ Gn, the steps of the siblings from their common parent in
generation n are dependent but steps corresponding to distinct generation n parents are independent.
We set Zn(x) = Zn({x}) for x ∈ Zd/R. Clearly Z satisﬁes the natural Markov property with respect
to (Gn) and Z0 = 1{0}.
We next deﬁne our coupled SIR epidemic (ηn, ξn, ρn) inductively in n so that ηj(x) := 1(x ∈ ηj) ≤
Zj(x) for all x ∈ Zd
R and j ≤ n, Fn := σ(ρ0, η1, η2, . . . , ηn) ⊂ Gn, and (ηj, ξj , ρj)j≤n has the law of
an SIR epidemic process. Set η0 = 1{0}(= Z0), assume the above for n, and consider n + 1. Let
Yn = {y ∈ Zd/R : ∃x ∈ ηn s.t. (x, y) ∈ ∂Cn} ⊂ ξn. If x ∈ ηn, then 1 ≤ Zn(x) (by induction) and so
we may choose a minimal αx
n (with respect to our total order) in the non-empty set {α ≈ n : Y α = x}.
One easily checks that αx
n (set it equal to ∆ if x /∈ ηn) is Gn-measurable. We deﬁne (recall that Dn(y)
is as in (1.5))

(2.7)

ηn+1 = {y ∈ Yn : ∃x ∈ Dn(y) s.t. Bαx

n∨(y−x) = 1}, ξn+1 = ξn \ ηn+1, ρn+1 = ξn ∪ ηn.

In this way αx
and Yn are Fn-measurable and αx
Fn+1 ⊂ Gn+1. Assume next that y ∈ ηn+1. Therefore there is an x ∈ Dn(y) such that Bαx
As we have αx

n labels the BRW representative at x in generation n for x ∈ ηn. The fact that Dn(y)
n is Gn-measurable shows that ηn+1 is Gn+1-measurable and so
n∨(y−x) = 1.

n ≈ n, the latter implies that αx

n ∨ (y − x) ≈ n + 1 and

Y αx

n∨(y−x) = Y αx

n + y − x = y.

Therefore Zn+1(y) ≥ 1 and we have proved that ηn+1 ≤ Zn+1. To complete the induction it suﬃces
to establish (1.6) in the stronger form

(2.8)

P(ηn+1 = V |Gn) = Yy∈V2\V

(1 − p)|Dn(y)| Yy∈V

[1 − (1 − p)|Dn(y)|] a.s. on {∂Cn = S},

where S, V , and V2 are as in (1.6). By (2.7) the left-hand side of the above equals

P(∀y ∈ V2 \ V ∀x ∈ Dn(y) Bαx

n∨(y−x) = 0,
and ∀y ∈ V ∃x ∈ Dn(y) s.t. Bαx

n∨(y−x) = 1|Gn).

One easily checks that the Gn-measurable collection of superscripts on the Bernoulli variables are
distinct and label particles in generation n+1. The fact that {Bα : |α| = n+1} are jointly independent
and independent of Gn now gives (2.8) from the above.

We restate what we have shown:

Proposition 2.3. There is a BRW (Zn, n ∈ Z+) and an SIR epidemic (ηn, n ∈ Z+) on a common
probability space s.t. ηn(x) ≤ Zn(x) for all x ∈ Zd/R, n ∈ Z+, and Z0 = η0 = 1{0}. Moreover
Z is a BRW in which each parent independently gives birth to a binomial (V (R), p(R)) number of
children (M ), where conditional on M , the oﬀspring locations relative to their parent is uniform over
N (0)(M).
In addition, both Z and (η, ρ) satisfy their natural Markov properties with respect to a
common ﬁltration (Gn) (for (η, ρ) it is (2.8) above).

2.3 Branching random walk bounds

We will need a pair of bounds on the BRW Z constructed above which are in the literature either
explicitly or implicitly. The ﬁrst is bound on the survival probability for a sequence of Galton-Watson
processes, which is almost immediate from Lemma 2.1(a) of Bramson et al [2].

9

Lemma 2.4. Let {X (k)} be a sequence of Galton-Watson branching processes each starting with a
single particle. Assume X (k) has a Binomial (Nk, qk) oﬀspring law where for some C > 0, and large
enough n,
(i) qk ≤ 1/2,
Then

(ii) 1 ≤ Nkqk ≤ 1 + C/k.

(2.9)

lim sup
k→∞

kP (X (k)

k > 0) ≤ K2.4(C) =

4C

1 − e−C .

Proof. If Yk has a binomial distribution with parameters (Nk, qk), then an easy calculation shows that
for large enough n

E(Y 3

k ) ≤ 2(cid:18)1 +

≤ 2(1 + C)3.

C

k(cid:19)3

This implies the uniform integrability of {Y 2
k } which is needed to apply Lemma 2.1 of [2]. Note also
that the variance of Yk is Nkqk(1 − qk) ≥ 1/2 for large enough k, and so we have the lower bound
on the variance also required in Lemma 2.1 of [2]. Finally the parameter νk := (1/2)E(Yk(Yk − 1))
satisﬁes lim inf k νk ≥ 1/4. It is now straightforward to apply Lemma 2.1(a) of [2] to get the above
upper bound.

The other result we will need concerns the range of the branching random walk Z constructed in
Proposition 2.3. Recall that Z0(x) = 1(x = 0) and the binomial oﬀspring distribution has parameters
V (R) and p(R) satisfying (2.1). Let Rn denote the range of Z up until n, that is,

.

Rn = {x ∈ Zd
R :

n

Xj=1

Zj(x) > 0}

Lemma 2.5. For any c > 0 and K ∈ N, there is an A(c, K), non-decreasing in c and K, such that for
all R ∈ N, n ≤ cRd−1, and r ≤ K√n,

P(Rn ∩ ([−r, r]d)c 6= ∅) ≤ A(r + 1)−2.

Finer results are available for nearest neighbour branching random walks (see, e.g., Theorem 7 of
Le Gall and Lin [7]) but as our branching random walk has some nonstandard features (such as a
“long range” random walk component) we outline the proof in the Appendix. It is a straightforward
modiﬁcation of the results in Section 4 (particularly Lemma 4.9) of Dawson, Iscoe, Perkins [3] from
their branching Brownian motion setting to the long-range branching random walk setting here.

3 Proof of Extinction

Assume that η0 = {0} and ρ0 = ∅ throughout this section. Recall that p(R) is chosen so that (2.1)
holds. Our aim in this section is to establish Theorem 1.5 by showing η becomes extinct a.s. for some
positive value of θ. The ﬁrst and main step is the following:

Proposition 3.1. There is a θ0 > 0 so that for all R ∈ N, and all 0 < θ ≤ θ0, there is a k ∈
{1, 2, . . . , Rd−1 + 1} so that E(|ηk|) ≤ 1 − θ.
Proof. To shorten notation we set

(3.1)

ε =

θ
Rd−1 ,

where θ ∈ (0, 1]. We see that (2.6) implies

Let us deﬁne the infection time τ (x) of a site x ∈ Zd by

if x ∈ ηn,
if x is never infected.

The second sum in (3.2) contains only x, y ∈ ρn+1 so that τ (y) ≤ τ (x). The x’s can appear at most
once in this summation but the y’s may appear multiple times corresponding to distinct values of k.
Nonetheless we have the inequality

We can now proceed in a manner similar to that of Bramson et al. [2], and decompose the interference
terms into regions of high density and low density. Fix K ∈ N, and consider the following sets:
(3.5)

In = [−K√n, K√n]d ,
An = {x ∈ ρn+1 : |{y ∼ x : y ∈ ρn+1}| ≥ 6εV (R)} .

n| + |(ρn+1 \ An) ∩ In| − 2|An ∩ In|i.

11

For the remainder of this section, we will work on each of the terms in (3.7) to show that the right-hand
side of (3.7) is negative some n for small enough θ. Henceforth we assume that

(3.8)

n ≤ 4Rd−1.

To prove that the term |ρn+1 ∩ I c

n| in (3.7) is small for large K, we will compare the range of
the epidemic with the range of the branching random walk Zn in Proposition 2.3. Recall that Zn is
constructed on the same probability space as the epidemic such that |ηk ∩ A| ≤ Zk(A) for any set
A ⊂ Zd/R. A routine calculation for the branching random walk shows that if Xk = X R
k is a simple
random walk, starting at the origin, taking steps uniformly in {x : x ∈ Zd
R, 0 < kxk∞ ≤ 1}, we have

the last by our choice of n in (3.8). We will get the desired bound, independent of R, by an application
of the Azuma–Hoeﬀding inequality (see, for example Theorem 2 of Hoeﬀding [8] and the comments at
the end of Section 2 of that reference).
Lemma 3.2. (Azuma-Hoeﬀding). Let Mn be a martingale with increments satisfying |Mk − Mk−1| ≤
ck a.s. for k ∈ N. Then we have for any N ∈ N and D > 0,

P(|MN − M0| ≥ D) ≤ 2 exp  −D2
2PN

k=1 c2

k! .

Applying the above to the martingale (X i

n)n, the i-th component of the random walk (Xn), we get

that for any 1 ≤ k ≤ n,

P(|X i

k| ≥ K√n) ≤ 2 exp(cid:18)−K 2n

2k (cid:19) ≤ 2 exp(−K 2/2) .

Therefore, we have for 1 ≤ k ≤ n,
(3.11)

P(kXkk∞ ≥ K√n) ≤ 2d exp(−K 2/2),

which by (3.10) yields

(3.12)

E(|ρn+1 ∩ I c

n|) ≤ e42dn exp(−K 2/2) .

Now consider the second term in (3.7) and deﬁne ζn = (ρn+1 \ An) ∩ In. Let C(r) denote a closed
cube of ℓ∞ diameter 1 that is ℓ∞ distance r ≥ 0 from the origin in Zd/R. There are at most 6εV (R)
elements inside C(r) ∩ ζn, since otherwise an element in C(r) ∩ ζn would have more than 6εV (R)

12

neighbours in ρn+1, contradicting the deﬁnition of ζn. Comparing the epidemic with the coupled
branching random walk Zn with range Rn up to time n, we can use Lemma 2.5 to conclude (recall
(3.8) and ε = θ/Rd−1) that for r ≤ 2K√n,

(3.13)

E(|C(r) ∩ ζn|) ≤ E(6εV (R)1(C(r) ∩ Rn 6= ∅)) ≤ 6εV (R)A(4, 2K)(r + 1)−2

≤ c1(K)θR(r + 1)−2 .

The number of such boxes C(r) with “integer corners” at ℓ∞ distance r ∈ [m, m + 1] (m ∈ Z+) from
the origin is bounded by C′(m + 1)d−1. We can cover ζn ⊂ In by the collections of these boxes for
m = 0, . . . ,⌊K√n⌋ and conclude that for a constant c2 = c2(K),

(3.14)

E(|ζn|) ≤

C′(m + 1)d−1c1(K)θR(m + 1)−2

⌊K√n⌋
Xm=0

⌊K√n⌋
Xm=0

(m + 1)d−3.

We strengthen (3.8) and now assume

(3.15)

Rd−1 ≤ n ≤ 4Rd−1.

Assume ﬁrst that d = 3. Continuing from (3.14), we use n−1/2 ≤ R−1 (from (3.15)) to see that for

n as above,

(3.16)

E(|ζn|) ≤ c2(K)(K√n + 1)θR ≤ 2c2(K)Knn−1/2θR ≤ 2c2(K)Kθn .

Substitute (3.16) and (3.12) into (3.7) to get

(3.17)

Eh|ηn| − 1i ≤ εn(cid:20)2e4d exp(−K 2/2) + 2c2(K)Kθ −

2
n

E(|An ∩ In|)(cid:21) for R2 ≤ n ≤ 4R2 .

Now set n = R2 and suppose that E(|ηk|) ≥ 0.9 for k = 1, . . . , n. Then, as |ρn+1| = Pn

have

k=0 |ηk|, we

(3.18)

E(|ρn+1|) ≥ 0.9n.

First choose K large enough so that 2e4d exp(−K 2/2) < 0.01, and then θ > 0 small enough so that
2c2(K)Kθ < 0.01. This and the bounds (3.16) and (3.12) show that

0.9n ≤ E(|ρn+1|) ≤ E(|ρn+1 ∩ I c

n| + |(ρn+1 \ An) ∩ In| + |An ∩ In|)

≤ n[e42de−K 2/2 + 2c2(K)θK +
≤ n × .02 + E(|An ∩ In|),

1
n

E(|An ∩ In|)]

and so E(|An ∩ In|) ≥ .88n. Therefore inserting the above and our choices of n, K and θ > 0 into
(3.17) we arrive at

E(|ηn| − 1) ≤ θ[.02 − 1.76] ≤ −θ.

Recall we had assumed that E(|ηk|) ≥ 0.9 for k = 1, . . . , n = R2, and so we may conclude that in any
case for small enough θ > 0 as above, for all R ∈ N,
(3.19)

for some 1 ≤ k ≤ R2 + 1, E(|ηk| − 1) ≤ −(.1 ∧ θ) < 0.

This completes the proof for d = 3 as we may take θ ≤ .1.

13

Assume next that d = 2. If one proceeds in the same manner as in the d = 3 case above, the sum
in (3.14) will lead to an extra logarithmic factor in the lower bound of λc. In this case we will need to
improve the bound (3.13) for smaller values of r by an appeal to the local central limit theorem.

Continue to assume (3.15), now with d = 2. Let {U R

: i ∈ N} be iid random vectors which are
uniformly distributed over the V (R) points in N (0). We can couple this sequence an iid sequence,
{Ui : i ∈ N} of random vectors which are uniformly distributed over [−1, 1]2 and such that kU R

Uik∞ ≤ R−1 (the precise assignment of regions of [−1, 1]2 to points in N (0) is not important). If

C(r) ∩ In 6= ∅. Recalling that r is the ℓ∞−distance of C(r) from 0 we see that r ≤ K√n.

m ∈ {1, 2 . . . ,⌈√nK⌉}, the number of such cubes C(r) with r ∈ [m − 1, m] is bounded by c0m for

Use the above bound in place of (3.16), so that instead of (3.17) we get

E(|ηn| − 1) ≤ εn[2e4 exp(−K 2/2) + C(K)θ[log((K + 1)/θ)]2 −
Since θ[log((K + 1)/θ)]2 decreases to 0 as θ ↓ 0, we may now proceed just as for d = 3 to conclude (in
place of (3.19)) that for small enough θ > 0, for all R ∈ N,

and the proof is complete.

We prove (3.26) by induction on m. The result is trivial for m = 0. Assume the result for m.

Consider µ particles starting at the origin in Rd. For each i ∈ Z+, on [ i

oﬀspring at the parent’s location, each with probability 1
t be the random measure which puts
mass µ−1 at the location of each particle at time t. (See Section 2 of [3] for a more detailed description
of this branching Brownian motion.) Let ˆX be the super-Brownian motion which is the unique in law
solution of the following martingale problem:

2 . Let ˆX µ

ˆXt(φ) = φ(0) + ˆMt(φ) +Z t

(M P )σ2,θ′

where ˆX is a continuous MF (Rd)-valued process, and ˆM (φ) is a continuous martingale with h ˆM (φ)it =
R t
ˆXs(φ2)ds.
It is well-known that ˆX µ converges weakly to ˆX (with σ2 = 1 and θ′ = 0) on D([0,∞), MF (Rd))
but we will need a result on the convergence of the ranges which does not follow from this alone. Let

t = {x ∈ Rd : ∃s ≤ t s. t. ˆX µ

s ({x}) > 0},

and let ˆRt denote the closed support of R t

ˆXs(·) ds.

Lemma 4.1. If Pδ0 denotes the law of ˆX as above with σ2 = 1 and θ′ = 0, then
1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c 6= ∅) ≤ Pδ0( ˆR1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c 6= ∅).

P( ˆRµ

(4.1)

lim sup
µ→∞

Proof. This is immediate from Lemma 4.9 and Theorem 4.7(a) of Dawson, Iscoe, and Perkins [3] and
the Transfer Principle of nonstandard analysis (to translate into standard terms). More speciﬁcally
the ﬁrst two results imply that for µ inﬁnite (ﬁxed), if x ∈ Rµ
1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c, then there is a sequence
xn in ˆR1 converging to the standard part of x, st(x). This shows the latter must be in ˆR1 as this set
is closed. Since st(x) is also in the complement of (−1, 1)d, we have shown that ˆR1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c is
non-empty. An immediate application of the Transfer Principle now gives the required result.

Remark 4.2. Just using the above weak convergence and elementary properties of ˆX (it never charges
the boundary of (−1, 1)d) one can easily show that

lim inf
µ→∞

P( ˆRµ

1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c 6= ∅) ≥ Pδ0 ( ˆR1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c 6= ∅),

but it is the upper bound that will be of interest.

Our immediate goal is to extend Lemma 4.1 from the above branching Brownian motion to the

context of the BRW Z constructed in Section 2.2. We shall see that Lemma 2.5 then follows easily.

To more closely parallel the setting in [3] we modify the setup for the branching envelope Z in
Section 2.2 while constructing a BRW ˜Z with the same branching dynamics as Z. Let ˜I = ∪∞n=0
N ×
{1, . . . , V (R)}n and for β, β′ ∈ ˜I, we deﬁne |β|, β|i, πβ and β < β′ as for I in Section 2.2. Assume
{ ˜M β : β ∈ ˜I} are iid Binomial (V (R), p) random variables, denoting the number of oﬀspring of particle
β, where we assume pV (R) ≥ 1 and, as always, R ∈ N. Fix an initial number of particles µ ∈ N. Write
β ≈ n iﬀ |β| = n, β0 ≤ µ, and βi+1 ≤ ˜M β|i, for all 0 ≤ i < n, meaning that β labels a particle which is
alive in the nth generation. Next, let (dβ∨i, i ≤ V (R))β∈ ˜I be a collection of iid random vectors, each
uniformly distributed over N (0)(V (R)) = {(e1, . . . , eV (R)) : {ei} all distinct}. For each β these are the
displacements of the potential children from the parent β. Therefore the historical path followed by
the ancestors of a particle β ∈ ˜I is

and its current location is

t = ˜Y β
˜Y β,µ

t =

|β|

Xi=1

1(i ≤ ⌊µt⌋)dβ|i,

˜Y β =

|β|

Xi=1

dβ|i ∈ Zd/R (so if |β| = 0, then ˜Y β = 0).

17

Note that for each β, ˜Y β
is a random walk which jumps at times i/µ for i ≤ |β|, and whose step
·
distribution is uniform over N (0). Let ˜Fn = σ( ˜M β : |β| < n) ∨ σ(dβ : 1 ≤ |β| ≤ n). Note for each
ﬁxed |β| = n, the event {β ≈ n} is in ˜Fn and ˜Y β is ˜Fn-measurable. Therefore
δ ˜Y β is an ˜Fn-measurable random measure.

˜Zn = Xβ≈n

Conditional on ˜Fn, ( ˜M β : β ≈ n} are iid binomial (V (R), p) random variables, and conditional on
˜Fn ∨ σ( ˜M β : β ≈ n), ( ˜Y β∨i − ˜Y β : i ≤ ˜M β)β≈n = (dβ∨i : i ≤ ˜M β)β≈n are independent random vectors
which for each β ≈ n are uniformly distributed over N (0)( ˜M β ). This shows ˜Z is a BRW with the same
oﬀspring law as that of the branching envelope Z, and hence:

(4.2)

if µ = 1, the laws of ˜Z and Z (from Proposition 2.3) are identical,

and in general ˜Z is equal in law to a sum of µ iid copies of Z.

Consider the rescaled random measures given by

˜X µ

t (A) =

1
µ

˜Z⌊µt⌋(√µA) =(cid:16) 1

µ Xβ≈⌊µt⌋

δ ˜Y β /√µ(cid:17)(A).

Proposition 4.3. If µn → ∞ and we choose Rn → ∞ and pn so that pnV (Rn) ≥ 1 and
limn µn(pnV (Rn)− 1) = θ′ ≥ 0, then ˜X µn ⇒ ˆX in D([0,∞), MF (Rd)), where ˆX is the super-Brownian
motion satisfying (M P )σ2,θ′, with σ2 = 1/3.

This is a minor modiﬁcation of the classical convergence theorem and may be proved by making
minor changes in the proof, for example, in Chapter II of [14]. The value σ2 = 1/3 arises as the
variance of the marginals of the uniform distributions over [−1, 1]d and the drift θ′ arises since the
mean number of oﬀspring is pnV (Rn) ∼ 1 + θ′
. Note there is dependence between particle steps only
if the particles are siblings and even here the steps are uncorrelated. This leads only to very minor
alterations to the usual proof in the setting of completely independent displacements.

µn

We assume in the rest of this section that (µn, pn, Rn), ˜X µn, and ˆX are as in Proposition 4.3, Pδ0

is the law of ˆX and ˆRt is the closed support of R t

0

ˆXs ds. Let

˜Rµn
t = {x ∈ Rd : ∃s ≤ t s. t. ˜X µn

s ({x}) > 0}.

Here is the version of Lemma 4.1 we will need.

Lemma 4.4.

(4.3)

lim sup
n→∞

P( ˜Rµn

1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c 6= ∅) ≤ Pδ0 ( ˆR1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c 6= ∅).

The result will follow just as in the proof of Lemma 4.1, once the analogues of Lemma 4.9 and
Theorem 4.7 of [3] are established. The analogue of Theorem 4.7 will be immediate from the following
uniform modulus of continuity for the historical paths of all particles in the BRW (just as Theorem 4.7
of [3] follows from Theorem 4.5 of that reference).

Lemma 4.5. For each L ∈ N there are positive constants ci(L), i = 1, 2, 3 and non-negative random
variables, δ(L, µn), such that for all n,

and if s, t ∈ [0, L] satisfy µ−1

P(δ(L, µn) ≤ ρ) ≤ c1(L)ρc2(L) for 0 ≤ ρ ≤ c3(L),
n ≤ t − s ≤ δ(L, µn), then for all β ≈ ⌊µnt⌋,

18

In Theorem 4.5 of [3] the analogous result is stated for the branching Brownian motion with

cp(t − s) log(1/(t − s)) (c > 2) in place of (t−s)1/8 but any modulus function will do for our purposes.
The proof of the above lemma is very similar. In place of the Gaussian bounds for the Brownian paths
one uses Lemma 3.2 as the coordinates of Y β
t are martingales with bounded jumps. The above cruder
modulus helps handle the very small values of t − s . Note that the restriction t − s ≥ 1/µn is natural
as the modulus is really only needed for s, t ∈ {i/µn : i ∈ Z+}. The slight super-criticality of our BRW
also leads to some minor changes including the time cut-oﬀ L and the use of the survival bound (2.9)
for our BRW (see the calculation in (4.4) below). We omit the proof.

Proof of Lemma 4.4. As noted above, given the previous lemma, it suﬃces to establish the analogue
of Lemma 4.9 in [3] for our slightly supercritical rescaled BRW’s ˜X µn. The proof for branching
Brownian motion goes through unchanged using Lemma 4.5 once the analogue of Lemma 4.8 of [3] is
established so we now consider this result. It is a nonstandard formulation of the fact that if t > 0
and tn → t are ﬁxed, then the sets Sµn
tn ({x}) > 0} converge weakly to the closed
support, S( ˆXt), of ˆXt w.r.t. the Hausdorﬀ metric as n → ∞. Fix tn → t > 0 and assume without loss
of generality that inf n tn > 0. If β ∈ ˜I and 0 ≤ ε ≤ s, let

tn = {x ∈ Zd/Rn : ˆX µn

In(s, ε) = {γ ∈ ˜I : γ ≈ ⌊(s − ε)µn⌋, ∃β ≈ ⌊sµn⌋ s.t. γ < β},

that is, In(s, ε) is the set of individuals in population ˜X µn
s . In
what follows we consider m large enough so that 2−m ≤ inf n tn. For γ ∈ In(tn, 2−m), let Nn(γ, tn) =
|{β ≈ ⌊µntn⌋ : β > γ}| be the number of descendants of γ alive in the population X µn
tn . A branching
process argument (with oﬀspring law binomial (V (Rn), pn)) using Lemma 2.1(c) of [2], shows that for
some C > 0,

s−ε which have descendants alive in ˜X µn

lim sup
n→∞

P(Nn(γ, tn) ≤ 8−mµn|γ ∈ In(tn, 2−m)) ≤ 1 − e−C4−m

where C may depend on θ′. In the last line we have used the growth condition on (V (Rn), pn), in the
fourth inequality we have used the deﬁnition of K2.4 from Lemma 2.4 to absorb it into C, and in the
third inequality we have used the survival probability bound in (2.9) with k = ⌊µn2−m⌋, for m ﬁxed.
To check that the hypotheses of Lemma 2.4 are in force, note that for large enough n,

1 ≤ V (Rn)p(Rn) ≤ 1 +

(4.4) gives the inequality in the display just before (4.27) in [3] and the rest of the proof of Lemma 4.8
of [3] now proceeds as for branching Brownian motion in that reference, again using our modulus of
continuity in Lemma 4.5. The idea is that the above bound shows that any point in the support of

19

X µn
tn will have enough mass nearby from its ancestor at time tn − 2−m for m large enough that it will
be arbitrarily close to a point in the support of the limiting ˆXt.
Proof of Lemma 2.5. It clearly suﬃces to consider r ∈ N. Let T0 = min{n : Zn(Rd) = 0}. For
n, r ∈ N as in the statement of the lemma we have
(4.5)

r2 ≤ cK 2Rd−1,

which implies that

.

P(Rn ∩ ([−r, r]d)c 6= ∅) ≤ P(T0 > r2) + P(Rr2 ∩ ([−r, r]d)c 6= ∅, T0 ≤ r2).

By the extinction bound (2.9) we have for suﬃciently large r, P(T0 > r2) ≤ 2K2.4(θcK 2)r−2 (if
not, choose sequences {rn} and {Rn} both going to ∞ so that we can contradict the conclusion of
Lemma 2.4.) Therefore for all r ∈ N we have P(T0 > r2) ≤ Br−2 for some B = B(cK 2). Hence, it
suﬃces to show

P(Rr2 ∩ ([−r, r]d)c 6= ∅) ≤ Ar−2 for r ∈ N as in (4.5) and A = A(c, K).

Assume that this is not the case. Then there are sequences of natural numbers rn → ∞ and Rn → ∞
such that

P(Rrn ∩ ([−rn, rn]d)c 6= ∅) = ∞.
Recall that we have chosen p(Rn) so that V (Rn)p(Rn) = 1 + θ/Rd−1
show that V (Rn)p(Rn) ≤ 1 + θK 2c
so that V (Rn)pn = 1 + θK 2c

holds, and if µn = r2
n, then

for some θ > 0. This and (4.7)

and so we may use this modiﬁed Bernoulli probability for which (4.8)

(4.9)

µn(V (Rn)pn − 1) = θK 2c =: θ′ > 0.

Now consider ˜X µn as above, and recalling (4.2), we have

P( ˜Rµn

1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c = ∅) = (1 − P(Rrn ∩ ((−rn, rn)d)c 6= ∅))r2

n → 0 as n → ∞,

by (4.8). On the other hand if B(0, 1) is the Euclidean open unit ball, then by Lemma 4.4 (recall (4.9))

lim inf
n→∞

(4.11)

P( ˜Rµn

1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c = ∅) ≥ Pδ0( ˆR1 ∩ ((−1, 1)d)c = ∅)

) = 0 ∀s ≥ 0)

where u is the unique radial solution of ∆u = u2 on B(0, 1) and u(x) → ∞ as |x| ↑ 1 (Theorem 1
of [9]). Together (4.10) and (4.11) give us the contradiction which completes the proof.
