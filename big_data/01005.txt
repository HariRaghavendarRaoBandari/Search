MV-ALGEBRAS, INFINITE DIMENSIONAL POLYHEDRA, AND NATURAL

DUALITIES

LEONARDO M. CABRER AND LUCA SPADA

Abstract. We connect the dual adjunction between MV-algebras and Tychonoﬀ spaces with
the general theory of natural dualities, and provide a number of applications. In doing so, we
simplify the aforementioned construction by observing that there is no need of using presen-
tations of MV-algebras in order to obtain the adjunction. We also provide a description of
the dual maps that is intrinsically geometric, and thus avoids the syntactic notion of deﬁnable
map. Finally, we apply these results to better explain the relation between semisimple tensor
products and coproducts of MV-algebras, and we extend beyond the ﬁnitely generated case the
characterisations of strongly semisimple and polyhedral MV-algebras.

1. Introduction

MV-algebras were introduced in 1959 by C. C. Chang as the equivalent algebraic semantics
of  Lukasieiwcz logic. Since then they increasingly attracted the attention of researchers for their
surprising connections with other ﬁelds of mathematics such as lattice ordered abelian groups,
measure theory, quantum mechanics, toric varieties, etc. The reader is referred to [25] for an
updated account of their theory.

In the last decades a number of diﬀerent approaches to describe dual categories of MV-algebras
have been proposed. One of the ﬁrst attempts can be found in [22, 23], where the author provides
a dual equivalence based on Priestley’s duality for distributive lattices. A similar approach can
also be found in [6]. A diﬀerent approach, is presented in [26]; there the author directly develops
dualities for ﬁnitely generated subvarieties of MV-algebras (i.e., the ones generated by a ﬁnite
number of ﬁnite algebras) using the general theory of natural dualities (see [10]).

In a diﬀerent vein, in [9] the authors start from the duality between ﬁnite multisets and ﬁnite
MV-algebras and build, using the ind and pro completions, a duality between locally ﬁnite MV-
algebras and a category of Stone spaces endowed with a multiplicity function. Yet another method
used to explore categories that are dual to MV-algebras is provided by sheaf theory. Indeed, in
[16] the authors prove that the whole category of MV-algebras is equivalent to the category of
sheaves on a compact Hausdorﬀ space whose stalks are local MV-algebras (i.e., MV-algebras with
a unique maximal ideal); although independent, this result can be seen as the translation in the
setting of MV-algebras of the sheaf representation of lattice ordered abelian groups provided in
[18]. Another duality, presented in [14], connects the whole category of MV-algebras with the
category of sheaves whose stalks are linearly ordered and whose base space is the spectrum of
prime ideals of an MV-algebra; also in this case the duality can be seen as a consequence of
an older result [11]. Finally, we mention [17] and references therein for an another approach to
dualities for MV-algebras based on Priestley duality, as well as for a uniﬁed treatment of sheaf
representations of MV-algebras.

In this paper we will concentrate on a duality for semisimple MV-algebras presented in [20].
There the authors generalise the classical dual adjunction between ideals of polynomials and aﬃne
varieties to the setting of MV-algebras, thus providing an adjunction between the whole category

of MV-algebras and the category of Tychonoﬀ spaces with appropriates arrows, called “deﬁnable
maps”. The duality for semisimple MV-algebras, as well as the one between ﬁnitely presented MV-
algebras and rational polyhedra is then obtained by specialising such an adjunction. A similar
approach turns out to be possible for any variety of algebras, the reader interested on this aspect
is referred to [7].

Here we will be concerned with the connection between the above geometrical dualities with

the general theory of natural dualities and the applications of this new approach.

The rest of the paper is arranged in three sections. In section 2 we provide some basic deﬁnitions
in universal algebra and piecewise linear geometry needed to recall the adjunction of [20]. Section
3 is devoted to showing the connections between the approach of [20] and the theory of natural
dualities. Speciﬁcally, Theorem 3.4 provides a purely geometrical characterisation of the deﬁnable
maps of [20] and Theorem 3.11 shows that the functors of [20] are naturally equivalent to the
functors arising form the theory of natural dualities. In section 4 we apply the theory developed
by extending some results in MV-algebras beyond the ﬁnitely generated case. More speciﬁcally,
in Theorem 4.4 we give a characterisation of the dual space of the (semisimple) tensor product of
MV-algebras. In Theorem 4.6 we give a characterisation of strongly semisimple MV-algebras that
extends [4] and [5]. Finally, in Theorem 4.12 we give a characterisation of polyhedral MV-algebras
that extends the results of [3].

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Universal algebra. The reader is referred to [19] for background in category theory and
to [2] for universal algebra. For convenience, let us assume in the subsequent discussion that
L is a ﬁxed algebraic language; we call L-algebra any algebraic structure for this language. A
prevariety K is a class of algebras sharing the same language L, that is closed under isomorphic
copies, subalgebras and products; in symbols K = ISP(K). If in addition a prevariety is closed
under homomorphic images then it is called variety. For the rest of this section K will denote a
prevariety.

Given a set X, we indicate by FK(X) the algebra freely generated by X in K, i.e., the unique
algebra (up to isomorphism) for which any function f : X → B, where B ∈ K, extends uniquely
to a homomorphism g : FK(X) → B. We call the elements of X, the free generators of FK(X).
Let S ⊆ (FK(X))2 and θ(S) be the congruence of FK(X) generated by S. If A ∈ K is isomorphic
to FK(X)/θ(S), we say that (X, S) is a presentation of A.

An algebra A ∈ K is said to be a ﬁnitely generated if there exists a presentation (X, S) where
X is ﬁnite; if in addition S is also ﬁnite, then A is called ﬁnitely presented. If K is a variety, for
each set X and S ⊆ (FK(X))2, the pair (X, S) is a presentation of the algebra FK(X)/θ(S) ∈ K.
Following [20] we call Kp the category whose objects are presentations of algebras in K and

morphisms are homomorphisms between the corresponding quotient algebras, that is

h ∈ HomKp (cid:0) (X, S), (Y, T )(cid:1)

iﬀ

h ∈ HomK(cid:0) FK(X)/θ(S), FK(Y )/θ(T )(cid:1).

To ﬁx the notation, we set

Deﬁnition 2.1 (The functor Q). The assignment QK, from Kp to K, is deﬁned as

on objects:

on morphisms:

QK ((X, S)) := FK(X)/θ(S)

QK(h) := h

It is trivial to see that Q is a functor.
Since every algebra in a (pre)variety is a quotient of a free algebra, that is, it admits a presen-
tation, the functor QK is dense. Since morphisms in K and Kp are the same and QK acts as the
identity on morphisms, QK is full and faithful. Therefore, the categories Kp and K are equivalent
(see [19, Theorem VI.4.1]).

Deﬁnition 2.2 (Choice functors). Any functor C : K → Kp such that QK ◦ C is naturally iso-
morphic to the identity functor on K is called a choice functor.

MV-ALGEBRAS AND NATURAL DUALITIES

The reason for the previous deﬁnition, is that each such a functor assigns an arbitrary pre-
sentation for each algebra in K, in other words it “chooses” a presentation. Trivially, the choice
functors for K are naturally equivalent.

For an algebra A ∈ K and X ⊆ A, let stX : FK(X) → A be the unique homomorphism from
FK(X) to A that extends the inclusion of X into A. When X = A, we call stX the structure of
A and we set θA := ker(stA). Among all possible choice functors for a variety K, a canonical one
is provided by the structure choice functor S K : K → Kp that we describe below.

Deﬁnition 2.3 (Structure Choice Functor). Let ιA : A → FK(A)/θA, be the isomorphism deﬁned
by ιA(a) = [a]θA, i.e., ιA maps a into the equivalence class of a modulo the congruence θA, (see
Fig. 1).

FK(A)

[ ]θA

Then S K : K → Kp is deﬁned:

on objects:

S K(A) := (A, θA),

and if h : A → B is a K-homomorphism,

on morphisms:

S K(h) := ιB ◦ h ◦ ι−1

A

It is easy to see that S K is a well-deﬁned functor and QK ◦ S K is naturally isomorphic to the
identity functor on K.

Since in the rest of the paper we will only work with MV-algebras, we will simply write S for

S MV .

2.2. MV-algebras. The standard references for MV-algebras are [8, 25]. An MV-algebra is an
abelian monoid (A, ⊕, 0) equipped with an operation ¬ such that ¬¬x = x, x ⊕ ¬0 = ¬0 and
x ⊕ ¬(x ⊕ ¬y) = y ⊕ ¬(y ⊕ ¬x). The standard MV-algebra [0, 1] is the MV-algebra whose universe
is the interval [0, 1], its operations are deﬁned by x ⊕ y = min{x + y, 1}, and ¬x = 1 − x and the
neutral element is 0.

A congruence on an MV-algebra A is maximal if it is maximal in the poset of proper congruences
of A. An MV-algebra is said to be simple if the identity congruence is maximal, and semisimple if
it is a subdirect product of simple MV-algebras. By [8, Theorem 3.5.1], an MV-algebra is simple if
and only if it is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the standard MV-algebra [0, 1], that is, if it belongs
to IS([0, 1]). Therefore, the class SMV of semisimple MV-algebras coincides with ISP([0, 1]). By
Chang’s completeness theorem (see e.g. [8, Theorem 2.5.3]) the class of all MV-algebras coincides
with HSP([0, 1]). Since [0, 1] generates the variety of MV-algebras, by a general result of Birkhoﬀ,
the free MV algebra on κ generators is isomorphic to the subalgebra of [0, 1][0,1]κ
generated by
the projections. McNaughton in [24], provided a nifty characterisation of those functions. We
postpone the statement of his theorem to Theorem 2.5, as we ﬁrst need to recall some basic
preliminaries in polyhedral topology.

2.3. Polyhedral topology. We refer to [15] for background on polyhedral topology. A simplex
S = conv(v0, . . . , vm) ⊆ Rn is called m-simplex if {v0, . . . , vm} are aﬃne linearly independent. The
simplex S is said to be rational if the coordinates of vi are rational numbers for each i = 0, . . . , m.
A polyhedron P in Rn is a ﬁnite union of (always closed) simplices P = S1 ∪ · · · ∪ St in Rn.
The set P is said to be a rational polyhedron if there are rational simplices T1, . . . , Tl such that
P = T1 ∪ · · · ∪ Tl. If I ′ ⊆ I are arbitrary sets, we denote by πI
I ′ the projection map from [0, 1]I
into [0, 1]I ′

.

LEONARDO M. CABRER AND LUCA SPADA

Deﬁnition 2.4 (Piecewise Linear Map). Let P ⊆ [0, 1]n and f : P → [0, 1] be a continuous map,
we say that f is piecewise linear if there exists a ﬁnite set of (aﬃne) linear maps f1, ..., fk : [0, 1]n →
[0, 1] such that for every x ∈ P there exists 1 ≤ i ≤ k and f (x) = fi(x).

More generally, if P ⊆ [0, 1]I where I is an arbitrary set, we say that f is piecewise linear if
→ [0, 1] such that for

there exists a ﬁnite subset I ′ ⊆ I and a piecewise linear map f ′ : [0, 1]I ′
every p ∈ P , f (p) = f ′(πI

I ′ (p)).

Theorem 2.5 (McNaughton Theorem). For any cardinal κ, the free MV-algebra on κ generators
is isomorphic to the algebra of continuous maps form [0, 1]κ into [0, 1] which are piecewise linear
and have integer coeﬃcients.

3. The adjunction between MV-algebras and Tychonoff spaces

We start this section by brieﬂy recalling the basic adjunction presented in [20]. We present

these results using the approach to presented algebras given in Section 2.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Deﬁnable Map). Given P ⊆ [0, 1]I and Q ⊆ [0, 1]J , a function η : P → Q is
deﬁnable if there exist elements tj ∈ F (I) for j ∈ J, such that

(1)

(η(p))(j) = tj(p) = ¯p(tj) for each p ∈ P and j ∈ J,

where ¯p : F (I) → [0, 1] is the unique MV-homomorphism that extends the map p : I → [0, 1].

Let T denote the category of subspaces of the Tychonoﬀ cubes [0, 1]I, with I ranging among

sets and deﬁnable maps as morphisms. Given a set S ⊆ (F (I))2, we deﬁne

(2)

V(S) = {p ∈ [0, 1]I | ¯p(s) = ¯p(t) for each (s, t) ∈ F 2(I)}.

Given a set P ⊆ [0, 1]I,

(3)

I(P ) = {(s, t) ∈ F 2(I) | ¯p(s) = ¯p(t) for each p ∈ P }.

By [20, Theorem 3.1], the pair (V, I) forms a Galois connection, such that

where cl denotes the closure operator in the Euclidean topology, and

I(V(S)) = rad(S),

V(I(P )) = cl(P )

where rad(S) denotes the radical of S, i.e., the intersection of all maximal congruences of F (I)
containing S.

Deﬁnition 3.2 (The functors V and I ). Let V : MV p → T be the functor deﬁned by:

on objects:

V (F (I), S) = V(S) ⊆ [0, 1]I,

and, if h : F (I)/θ(S) → F (J)/θ(R) is a homomorphism and p ∈ V(R),

on morphisms:

(cid:0)V (h)(p)(cid:1)(j) = ¯p(ti), for each i ∈ I

where ti ∈ F (J) is an arbitrary element of [h(i)]θ(R).

Let I : T → MV p be the functor deﬁned by:

on objects:

I (P ⊆ [0, 1]I) = (F (I), I(P )),

and, if P ⊆ [0, 1]I, Q ⊆ [0, 1]J , f : P → Q is a deﬁnable map, and tj ∈ F (I) for each j ∈ J are
deﬁning terms for f ,

on morphisms:

(cid:0)I (f ))(cid:1)([s((Xj )j∈J )]I(Q) = [s((Xj/tj)j∈J )]I(P ),

where by s(X/t) we mean, as usual, the term obtained from s(X) by uniformly substituting the
occurrences of X for t.

In [20, Theorem 2.8], the authors prove that these functors are well-deﬁned, and that they
form a dual adjunction between presented MV-algebras and Tychonoﬀ spaces. Furthermore, by
[20, Corollary 3.2], when restricted to semisimple MV-algebras and to closed subspaces of the
Tychonoﬀ cubes, V and I determine a dual categorical equivalence.

MV-ALGEBRAS AND NATURAL DUALITIES

3.1. Deﬁnable maps vs. Z-maps. The restriction of V and I to ﬁnitely presented MV-algebras
deserves special attention. In [20, section 4] it is proved that given a ﬁnite presentation (m, S),
its dual space V (m, S) ⊆ [0, 1]m is a rational polyhedron, and vice versa if V (m, S) ⊆ [0, 1]m is
a rational polyhedron then there exists a ﬁnite T ⊆ (F (m))2 such that rad(S) = rad(T ). As a
consequence, the restriction of the functor V to ﬁnite presentations determines a categorical duality
between ﬁnitely presented MV-algebras and the category of rational polyhedra with deﬁnable
maps. McNaughton theorem (Theorem 2.5), then allows a purely geometric description of the
latter category by noticing that on rational polyhedra deﬁnable maps are exactly the piecewise
linear maps with integer coeﬃcients.

In [3], the authors improve the above results by showing that deﬁnable maps on compact subset
of [0, 1]n again admit a geometrical description1; therefore giving a purely geometrical description
of the dual of the full subcategory of ﬁnitely generated MV-algebras. We now give a slightly more
general deﬁnition of Z-maps that aﬀords a complete, geometrical characterisation of deﬁnable
maps on any subset of [0, 1]I .
Deﬁnition 3.3 (Z-map). Let I, J be arbitrary sets and P ⊆ [0, 1]I and Q ⊆ [0, 1]J . A map
η : P → Q is called a Z-map if for every j ∈ J there exists a piecewise linear map with integer
coeﬃcients ξj : [0, 1]I → [0, 1], such that for any p ∈ P

η(p) = (cid:0)ξj(p)(cid:1)j∈J ,

where (by the deﬁnition of piecewise linear map) each map ξj depends only upon ﬁnitely many
variables.
Theorem 3.4. Let I, J be arbitrary sets and P ⊆ [0, 1]I and Q ⊆ [0, 1]J . For any map η : P → Q,
the following are equivalent
(i) the map η is deﬁnable;
(ii) the map η is a Z-map;
(iii) for each ﬁnite subset J ′ ⊆ J there exists a ﬁnite set I ′ ⊆ I and a Z-map ξ : [0, 1]I ′

→ [0, 1]J ′

such that πJ

Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii). If η is deﬁnable then there exists a family of deﬁning terms tj such that for each
p ∈ P , (η(p))(j) = ¯p(tj) for j ∈ J. By Theorem 2.5, each term tj corresponds to a piecewise linear
map with integer coeﬃcients τj , such that tj(x) = τj (x). Hence η is a Z-map.
(ii) ⇒ (iii). Suppose η : P ⊆ [0, 1]I → Q ⊆ [0, 1]J is a Z-map, then by Deﬁnition 3.3, there
is a family {ξj}j∈J of piecewise maps with integer coeﬃcients such that for any p ∈ P , η(p) =

(cid:0)ξj(p)(cid:1)j∈J . Let J ′ be a ﬁnite subset of J. By Deﬁnition 2.4, for each j ∈ J ′ there exists a ﬁnite
I ′ := Sj∈J ′ Ij and deﬁne ξ′′

subset Ij ⊆ I and a piecewise linear map ξ′
. Then

j : [0, 1]Ij → [0, 1], such that ξj = ξ′

. Now let

j ◦ πI

j = ξ′

j ◦ πI ′

j ◦ πI ′

Ij )j∈J ′ ◦ πI

I ′ = (ξ′′

j )j∈J ′ ◦ πI
I ′ .

(iii) ⇒ (i). Let us pick J ′ in (iii) to be a singleton set J ′ := {j ′}, then there exists a ﬁnite I ′
and a Z-map ξj ′ : [0, 1]I ′
I ′ . Let tj ′ be the term associated to the
map ξ by Theorem 2.5. Then the last equality is equivalent to say that for any p = (pi)i∈I ∈ P ,
(cid:0)η(p)(cid:1)j ′ = tj ′(cid:0)(pi)i∈I ′(cid:1). Finally, by applying the same reasoning to every j ∈ J, we obtain a

→ [0, 1] such that πj ′ ◦ η = ξ ◦ πI

family of terms tj that deﬁne η.

(cid:3)

1Actually, the result in [3] refers to compact sets in Rn instead of closed subsets of [0, 1]n, but the diﬀerence is

immaterial as noted in [21, Claim 3.5].

LEONARDO M. CABRER AND LUCA SPADA

Remark 3.5. Notice that the equivalence to item (iii) in the above theorem has a natural algebraic
interpretation.
Indeed, using the duality of [3], the dual of homomorphisms between ﬁnitely
generated algebras are Z-maps (between subset of ﬁnite dimensional cubes). Now, if A and B are
two MV-algebras and h : A → B is a map between them, then by general universal algebra, h is a
homomorphism if, and only if, for each ﬁnitely generated subalgebra C of A, there exists a ﬁnitely
generated subalgebra D of B such that h restricted to C is a homomorphism into D.

Remark 3.6. In the rest of the paper, we will only work with closed subspaces of [0, 1]I for an
arbitrary set I. To ﬁx the notation, let us indicate by Tc the full subcategory of T whose objects
are closed spaces. It is readily seen that the functor V actually ranges in Tc, so in the rest of the
paper we will freely think of it as a functor from MV p into Tc without further notice.

3.2. From MV-algebras to Tychonoﬀ spaces. The functor V , of Section 3 is deﬁned on each
MV-algebra A by means of a presentation (F (X), S). This choice is justiﬁed by the authors of
[20] by the following:

“ . . . we know of no way of associating to an abstract MV-algebra its dual object,
as constructed in this paper, other than by arbitrarily choosing a presentation of
the algebra.”

In this section we give an alternative description of the dual adjunction between MV-algebras
and Tychonoﬀ spaces that is independent of the presentation. Our functor is based on a con-
travariant representable functor (in the sense of [19, Chapter III.2]) and hinges on the general
theory of natural dualities (as it applies to prevarieties generated by an inﬁnite algebra [12, 13]).
One ﬁrst presents a topology τ for the generating algebra G, that is compact Hausdorﬀ and such
that all internal operations are τ -continuous, then one considers as dual space of an algebra A the
topological space Hom(A, G) seen as subspace of GA.

Following the usual notation in natural dualities, let [0, 1] denote the standard MV-algebra on
denote the topological subspace of the real numbers with the Euclidean topology.

[0, 1] and [0, 1]

Deﬁnition 3.7 (The functor W ). Let W : MV → Tc be the assignment deﬁned by:

g

on objects:

W (A) = Hom(A, [0, 1]),

and, if h : A → B is an MV-homomorphism and g ∈ W (B),

on morphisms:

where Hom(A, [0, 1]) is seen as a subspace of [0, 1]

A.

(cid:0)W (h)(cid:1)(g) = g ◦ h,

Remark 3.8. Observe that there is a bijective correspondence from Hom(A, [0, 1]) into Max(A)
(the set of maximal ideals of A): it is given by f 7→ {a ∈ A | f (a) = 0}. If one endows Max(A)
with the topology generated by the closed elements of the form Vf = {M ∈ Max(A) | f ∈ M },
then the above correspondence turns out to be a homeomorphism.

g

Theorem 3.9. For each A ∈ MV and each MV-homomorphism h,

(1) W (A) is a closed subset of [0, 1]

A, and

(2) W (h) is a well-deﬁned continuous map.

So, W is a well-deﬁned functor.

g

Proof. By Remark 3.8, we obtain the compactness of W (A) immediately from the compactness of
Max(A) (for the compactness of Max(A) see e.g., [25, Proposition 4.15]). Since [0, 1]A is Hausdorﬀ,
(1) follows.

To prove (2), let h : A → B be an MV-homomorphism. The fact the W (h) : W (B) → W (A) is
a well-deﬁned map, follows directly from the fact that g ◦ h : A → [0, 1] is an MV-homomorphism
for each g ∈ Hom(B, [0, 1]).

To see that it is continuous it is enough to prove that πa ◦ W (h) is continuous for each a ∈ A.

It is easy to see that πa ◦ W (h) = πh(a) (see Fig. 2). Indeed, for each g ∈ W (B),
(πa ◦ W (h))(g) = πa(g ◦ h) = (g ◦ h)(a) = g(h(a)) = πh(a)(g).

Remark 3.10. Unfortunately, in item (1) of the above proof, the role played by the continuity
of the operations in [0, 1] is hidden. However, in the setting of natural dualities, this property is
central to establish that the functors considered are well-deﬁnite (see [10, Exercise 2.9]). Therefore,
in the spirit of this section, we show how to prove that Hom(A, [0, 1]) is a closed subset of [0, 1]
using the general argument of natural dualities.

A

We show that Hom(A, [0, 1]) contains all its limit points. To this end, pick any f 6∈ Hom(A, [0, 1]).

g

Trivially, one of the following conditions must hold:

(i) f (0) 6= 0.
(ii) There exists a ∈ A, with f (¬a) 6= ¬f (a).
(iii) There exist a, b ∈ A, with f (a ⊕ b) 6= f (a) ⊕ f (b).

is Hausdorﬀ, there exist open sets U, V ⊆ [0, 1] such that
Assume (iii) is the case. Since [0, 1]
f (a ⊕ b) ∈ U , f (a) ⊕ f (b) ∈ V and U ∩ V = ∅. Since ⊕ : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] is continuous the inverse
image of V is open in [0, 1]2. In other words there exist open sets Va, Vb ⊆ [0, 1] such that

g

(4)

x ⊕ y ∈ V if, and only if, (x, y) ∈ Va × Vb.

Notice that, since f (a) ⊕ f (b) ∈ V one has f (a) ∈ Va, f (b) ∈ Vb.

For each c ∈ A, let πc : [0, 1]A → [0, 1] be deﬁned as the evaluation πc(h) = h(c), for h ∈ [0, 1]A.

Consider also the set

O = π−1

a (Va) ∩ π−1

b (Vb) ∩ π−1

a⊕b(U ),

which is open because the evaluations are continuous maps.

From f (a) ∈ Va, f (b) ∈ Vb and f (a ⊕ b) ∈ U , one immediately has f ∈ O. On the other hand,
for any g ∈ O, one has that g(a ⊕ b) ∈ U and, by (4), that g(a) ⊕ g(b) ∈ V . Since U ∩ V = ∅,
g(a ⊕ b) must diﬀer from g(a) ⊕ g(b), hence, g /∈ Hom(A, [0, 1]). Thus, O and Hom(A, [0, 1]) are
A and the claim in proved. The
disjoint. Therefore, f is not a limit point of Hom(A, [0, 1]) ⊆ [0, 1]

cases (i) and (ii) can be dealt using similar arguments.

Theorem 3.11. Let the functors S , V and W be deﬁned as in Deﬁnitions 2.3, 3.2, and 3.7,
respectively. Then W = V ◦ S , so for each choice functor C : MV → MV p, the functor W is
naturally equivalent to the functor V ◦ C .

Proof. We start by proving that W = V ◦ S . Given p ∈ [0, 1]A, recall that ¯p : F (A) → [0, 1] is the
unique MV-homomorphism that extends p. It follows form general algebra that a homomorphism
from h : F (A) → [0, 1] factors through stA if and only if ker(h) ⊇ ker(stA) = θA (see Fig. 3).

Thus, for each MV-algebra A

(5)

p ∈ Hom(A, [0, 1]) iﬀ ker(¯p) ⊇ θA.

Therefore,

V ◦ S (A) = V(θA) = {p ∈ [0, 1]A | s(p) = t(p), for each (s, t) ∈ θA}

= {p ∈ [0, 1]A | ¯p(s) = ¯p(t), for each (s, t) ∈ θA}
= {p ∈ [0, 1]A | ker(¯p) ⊇ θA}
= Hom(A, [0, 1]).

Recall that V sends a homomorphism f : F (I)/θ → F (J)/θ′ into the function

(6)

V (f )(p) = (fx(p))x∈µ = (¯p(fi))i∈I for each p ∈ [0, 1]J ,

where fi ∈ f ([i]θ) is arbitrarily chosen for each i ∈ I. Now let h : A → B be an MV-homomorphism.
For each a ∈ A,

(7)

S (h)([a]θA ) = ιB ◦ h ◦ ι−1

A ([a]θA ) = ιB(h(a)) = [h(a)]θB .

Then, ﬁxing an arbitrary fa ∈ [h(a)]θB for each a ∈ A, it follows from (6) and (7)

((V ◦ S )(h))(p) = (V (S (h))) (p) = (¯p(fa))a∈A = (¯p(h(a)))a∈A

= (p(h(a))a∈A = ((p ◦ h)(a)))a∈A = p ◦ h,

for each p ∈ V(θB) = Hom(B, [0, 1]). Which ﬁnishes the proof that V ◦ S = W . As an immediate
consequence, we obtain that W is naturally isomorphic to V ◦ C for any choice functor C : MV →
MV p.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.12. There is an advantage in working with presentations and the operator V rather
than Hom: the choice of a presentation allows more control on the dimension of the Tychonoﬀ
spaces associated with the algebras. E.g., when a semisimple MV-algebra A is generated by a
ﬁnite set of elements a1, . . . , am ∈ A then A ∼= F (m)/θ for some θ congruence of F (m). Using θ
instead of θA we have V (A) = V(θ) ⊆ [0, 1]

A.

Remark 3.13. It is easy and useful to explicitly see how the natural isomorphism from V ◦ C to
W works for any choice functor. Let us ﬁx a choice functor C : MV → MV p. By Deﬁnition 2.2,
the pair C , Q is an equivalence of categories, thus let ρ : IdMV → Q ◦ C be its unit. Recalling
(Deﬁnition 2.3) that ιA are the components of a natural isomorphism from IdMV to Q ◦ S . Then
the assignment A 7→ V (C (ιA ◦ ρ−1

A ) is the natural isomorphism from V ◦ C to W . (See Fig. 4.)

We now prove a simple but useful lemma that describes how W operates on subalgebras gen-

erated by a ﬁnite set of generators.

Lemma 3.14. Let A be a semisimple MV-algebra, let C ⊆ A and let B the subalgebra of A
generated by C. The dual of B, W (B) is Z-homeomorphic to πA

C (W (A)).

Proof. Since B is generated by C, there exists a choice functor C , such that C (B) = (F (C), θ). It
is easy to see that the map ρB(c) = [c]θ for each element c ∈ C extends to an isomorphism from B
into F (C)/θ. Let inc : B → A be the inclusion homomorphism, and set f = ιA ◦ inc ◦ ρ−1
B . Thus,
f : F (C)/θ → F (A)/θA is such that f ([c]θ) = [c]θA. Now, to apply the functor V of Deﬁnition
3.2 to f , we need to select an arbitrary element of [c]θA, for each c ∈ C. If we pick c ∈ [c]θA we can
write

(8)

V (f ) : V(θA) → V(θ),

V (f )(p) = (¯p(c))c∈C = πA

C (p),

for each p ∈ V(θA). Finally, by Theorem 3.11, W (B) is Z-homeomorphic to V (C (B)) so we
conclude that W (B) is Z-homeomorphic to πA
(cid:3)

C (W (A)).

3.3. From Tychonoﬀ spaces to MV-algebras. Extending the parallel between this represen-
tation and natural dualities we set

Deﬁnition 3.15 (The functor M ). Let M : Tc → MV be the assignment deﬁned by:

on objects:

M (X) = Tc(X, [0, 1]

), for each X ∈ Tc,

and if η ∈ Tc(X, Y ) and ξ ∈ M (Y ),

on morphisms:

where Tc(X, [0, 1]

) is seen as a subalgebra of [0, 1]X .

g

(cid:0)Tc(η)(cid:1)(ξ) = ξ ◦ η,

g

Proposition 3.16. The assignment M is a well-deﬁned contravariant functor. Moreover, for
each MV-algebra A, the map evA : A → M (W (A)) deﬁned by (evA(a))(f ) = f (a) is an onto
map and the assignment A 7→ evA is a natural transformation from IdMV to M ◦ W . Similarly,
co-evX : X → W (M (X)) deﬁned by (co-evA(x))(g) = g(x) determines a natural transformation
from IdTc to W ◦ M .

Proof. For any object X in Tc the image M (X) is an MV-algebra, for by Theorem 3.4, Z-maps
coincide with deﬁnable maps, and it is readily seen that deﬁnable maps are closed under MV-
operations. Further, it is straightforward to check that M (η) is an MV-homomorphism for each
η ∈ Tc(X, Y ), hence M is a well-deﬁned functor.

For A ∈ MV we ﬁrst prove that evA is well deﬁned. Indeed, if a ∈ A, since W (A) ⊆ [0, 1]A, we
have that evA(a) coincides with the projection πA
a , that is trivially a Z-map. The fact that it is
an MV-homomorphism follows directly from the deﬁnition of evA and the fact that elements of
W (A) are MV-homomorphisms.

To see that the association A 7→ evA is natural in A consider an MV-homomorphism h : A → B

and let f ∈ W (B). Then

evB(h(a))(f ) = f (h(a)) = f ◦ h(a)

= evA(a)(f ◦ h)

= (evA(a) ◦ W (h))(f )

= (cid:16) M W (h)(evA(a))(cid:17)(f )

for each a ∈ A.

To prove that evA is onto let η ∈ M W (A) = Tc(W (A), [0, 1]

). Since by Theorem 3.4, η is a
deﬁnable map, there exists a term t ∈ F (A) such that for any p ∈ W (A), η(p) = t(p). Let us ﬁx
a = stA(t). We claim that η = evA(a). Indeed, p ∈ W (A),

g

η(p) = t(p) = p([t]θA) = p ◦ stA(t) = f (a).

The fact the co-ev is a natural transformation from IdTc to W ◦ M follows by similar arguments.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.17. The natural duality expert will recognise in Proposition 3.16 the adjunction be-
tween the natural functors determined by [0, 1] and its alter ego [0, 1]
. The fact that the repre-
sentable functors are well deﬁned and that the evaluation maps determine a dual adjunction is
ensured by the compatibility conditions between the algebra and its alter ego. In our case, since
the alter ego is just a totopological space, without relational of functional structure, the compat-
ibility condition reduces to the continuity of the operations in [0, 1] with respect to the topology
of [0, 1]

. We included a short proof here for completeness.

Remark 3.18. It is worthwhile to notice explicitly that the functors M and I are naturally
isomorphic, i.e., for any set I and any subset of X ⊆ [0, 1]I there is an isomorphism between
I (X) and M (X), natural in X. Indeed, recall that I (X) corresponds to the algebra F (I)/I(X)
(with the notation in the equation (3)), while by Theorem 3.4, M (X) is the algebra of deﬁnable
functions restricted to X. The isomorphism is hence described by sending a generic element
t(x)/I(X) into the deﬁnable function given by t. It is straightforward to see that this is a well-
deﬁned, bijective homomorphism. By way of example we show injectivity: suppose that s and
t are two terms whose corresponding deﬁnable functions are equal on X, then by deﬁnition (see
equation (3)) the pair (s, t) belongs to I(X), so s/I(X) = t/I(X) in F (I)/I(X) and the claim is
proved.

Theorem 3.19. The functor M and the restriction of W to SMV determine a dual categorical
equivalence between Tc and SMV.

Proof. Observe that by [25, Theorem 4.16], for each X ∈ Tc, the MV-algebra M (X) is a separating
subalgebra of [0, 1]X , hence it is semisimple. So, in fact the functor M ranges in SMV.

We have already observed that evA : A → M (X) is an onto map for each A ∈ MV. If A ∈ SMV,
then evA is also one-to-one this follow directly from the fact that A ∈ ISP([0, 1]). Therefore, ev is
a natural isomorphism between IdMV and M ◦ W . Similarly, using [25, Theorem 4.16], it follows
that co-ev is a natural isomorphism between IdTc and W ◦ M .
(cid:3)

Remark 3.20. There are two diﬀerences between our presentation and the natural duality ap-
proach. Firstly, we keep the embedding Hom(A, G) ⊆ GA into a Tychonoﬀ cube as an intrinsic part
of the dual space. In other words, we keep track of a certain coordinate system for the topological
space. The importance of this statement cannot be overestimated. The notion of Z-map between
closed subspaces of Tychonoﬀ cubes relies on the enveloping cubes. Without the coordinate sys-
tems the notion of projection map does not make sense. Moreover, our deﬁnition of M rests upon
Z-maps, and therefore depends on the enveloping cube.

The second important diﬀerence is that our description of dual of morphisms is not obtained as
structure preserving maps, but in a geometric way depending on how each subspace is embedded
into a Tychonoﬀ cube.

4. Applications

4.1. Coordinate systems and tensor products. In this subsection we describe the dual of
the semisimple tensor product of semisimple MV-algebras. This provides a clear example to our
earlier observation on the signiﬁcance of keeping track of the embedding of the dual space into a
Tychonoﬀ cube (see Remark 3.20). We refer the reader to [25, Chapter IX] for the deﬁnition and
construction of MV-tensor product and the semisimple tensor product. According to Remark 3.8,
we identify the maximal spectrum of A with W (A). Let us ﬁx for the remainder of this section

two semisimple MV-algebras A and B, and let A ⊗ B and A` B denote their semisimple tensor

product and coproduct, respectively.

In [25, Example 9.15] it is observed that even for ﬁnite (whence semisimple) MV-algebras the
(semisimple) tensor product and the coproduct do not coincide. However, as shown below, the
maximal spectrum of the tensor product A ⊗ B is homeomorphic to the maximal spectrum of the

MV-ALGEBRAS AND NATURAL DUALITIES

11

coproduct A` B. This happens because even if W (A ⊗ B) is homeomorphic to W (A` B), their

enveloping cubes are diﬀerent as we show in the remainder of the section.

We start with an easy corollary of duality result obtained in the previous section.

Corollary 4.1. The maximal spectra W (A` B) and W (A) × W (B) are Z-homeomorphic.

Proposition 4.2. The maximal spectra W (A ⊗ B) and W (A) × W (B) are homeomorphic.

Proof. In [25, Theorem 9.17] it is proved that A ⊗ B is isomorphic to the subalgebra C of
(W (A)×W (B)) generated by the maps (f · g)(x, y) = f (x) · g(y) for
continuous functions in [0, 1]
(f, g) ∈ M (W (A)) × M (W (B)), where f (x) · g(y) denotes the usual product of f (x) and g(y)
in [0, 1]. It is also observed there that this algebra is separating. Hence, by [8, Theorem 3.4.3],
W (C) ∼= W (A) × W (B).

g

(cid:3)

Corollary 4.3. The maximal spectra W (A` B) and W (A ⊗ B) are homeomorphic.

Finally we prove the following theorem.

Theorem 4.4. Let · : [0, 1]A × [0, 1]B → [0, 1]A×B be the map deﬁned by

(f · g)(a, b) := f (a) · g(b)

for each (f, g) ∈ [0, 1]A × [0, 1]B.
The spaces W (A ⊗ B) ⊆ [0, 1]

A⊗B and ·(W (A) × W (B)) ⊆ [0, 1]

A×B are Z-homeomorphic.

Proof. By [25, Construction 9.12 and Proposition 9.13], A ⊗ B admits the presentation (A × B, R)
where R is the smallest set containing, for any a, a1, a2 ∈ A and any b, b1, b2 ∈ B:

g

g

(1) ((1, 1), 1), ((a, 0), 0) and ((0, b), 0)

(2) (cid:0)(a, b1 ∨ b2), (a, b1) ∨ (a, b2)(cid:1)
(3) (cid:0)(a1 ∨ a2, b), (a1, b) ∨ (a2, b)(cid:1)
(4) (cid:0)(a, b1 ∧ b2), (a, b1) ∧ (a, b2)(cid:1)
(5) (cid:0)(a1 ∧ a2, b), (a1, b) ∧ (a2, b)(cid:1)
(6) (cid:0)(a, b1) ⊙ (a, b2), 0(cid:1), whenever b1 ⊙ b2 = 0
(7) (cid:0)(a1, b) ⊙ (a2, b), 0(cid:1), whenever a1 ⊙ a2 = 0
(8) (cid:0)(a, b1 ⊕ b2), (a, b1) ⊕ (a, b2)(cid:1), whenever b1 ⊙ b2 = 0
(9) (cid:0)(a1 ⊕ a2, b), (a1, b) ⊕ (a2, b)(cid:1), whenever a1 ⊙ a2 = 0.

So, by Theorem 3.11, W (A⊗ B) is Z-homeomorphic to V (A×B, R) = V(R) ⊆ [0, 1]A×B. We claim
that V(R) = ·(W (A) × W (B)). First observe that for each (p, q), (r, s) ∈ W (A) × W (B)),·(p, q) =
·(r, s) implies (p, q) = (r, s).
Indeed, since the maps p, q, r, and s are MV-homomorphisms,
p(1) = r(1) = q(1) = s(1) = 1, so, if ·(p, q) = ·(r, s) then p = r and q = s.

We prove that ·(W (A) × W (B)) ⊆ V(R). Let r ∈ ·(W (A) × W (B)), so there are p ∈ W (A) ⊆

[0, 1]A and q ∈ W (B) ⊆ [0, 1]B such that r = p · q. We have

r(1, 1) = p(1) · q(1) = 1 = r(1)

r(a, 0) = p(a) · q(0) = 0 = r(0)

r(a, b1 ∨ b2) = p(a) · q(b1 ∨ b2) = p(a) · (q(b1) ∨ q(b2))

= (p(a) · q(b1)) ∨ (q(a) · p(b2))
= r(a, b1) ∨ r(a, b2) = r((a, b1) ∨ (a, b2)).

12

LEONARDO M. CABRER AND LUCA SPADA

If b1 ⊙ b2 = 0, since q(b1) ⊙ q(b2) = 0 and q(b1) ⊕ q(b2) = q(b1) + q(b2), we have

r((a, b1) ⊙ (a, b2)) = r(a, b1) ⊙ r(a, b2) = (p(a) · q(b1)) ⊙ (p(a) · q(b2))

= p(a) · (q(b1) ⊙ q(b2)) = 0 = r(0))

r(a, b1 ⊕ b2) = p(a) · q(b1 ⊕ b2)

= p(a) · (q(b1) ⊕ q(b2)) = p(a) · (q(b1) + q(b2))
= (p(a) · q(b1)) + (p(a) · q(b2)) = r(a, b1) + r(a, b2)
= r(a, b1) ⊕ r(a, b2)
= r((a, b1) ⊕ (a, b2)).

The rest of the necessary conditions to ensure that p · q is in V(R) can be checked in a similar way.
To prove that V(R) ⊆ ·(W (A) × W (B)), let r ∈ V(R). Observe that the map r : A × B → [0, 1]
is a bimorphism. Then by [25, Lemma 9.11], the map p : A → [0, 1] deﬁned by p(a) = r(a, 1) is an
MV-homomorphism. Similarly q : B → [0, 1] deﬁned by q(b) = r(1, b) is an MV-homomorphism.
Therefore (p, q) ∈ W (A) × W (B). Finally by [25, Lemma 9.16], r(a, b) = p(a) · q(b).
(cid:3)

W (A) × W (B) ⊆ [0, 1]

Summing up, by Corollary 4.1, the dual of the coproduct W (A` B) is Z-homeomorphic to

A⊎B (where ⊎ denote disjoint union) while by Theorem 4.4 the dual of
A×B. Therefore,

the tensor product, W (A ⊗ B) is Z-homeomorphic to ·(W (A) × W (B)) ⊆ [0, 1]
although the two spaces are homeomorphic, they diﬀer on the enveloping space.

4.2. Strongly semisimple MV-algebras. In this subsection and the following one we apply the
duality of the previous section to extend the characterisations of two kinds of MV-algebras that
up to now only work for ﬁnitely generated MV-algebras. A crucial observation will be that the
properties to be checked for the characterisations depend only on ﬁnitely generated subalgebras.
Following Dubuc and Poveda [14], we say that an MV-algebra A is strongly semisimple if all
its quotients over a principal ideal are semisimple. In [4], Busaniche and Mundici characterised 2-
generated strongly semisimple MV-algebras, and in [5] the ﬁrst author generalised their result to all
ﬁnitely generated MV-algebras. This characterisation is based on the n-dimensional generalisation
of Bouligand-Severi tangents (see [1, 28, 29]). We extend here the characterisation to all strongly
semisimple MV-algebras, but ﬁrst we need to recall some deﬁnitions.

Given a k-tuple u = (u1, . . . , uk) of pairwise orthogonal unit vectors in Rn, for each l ≤ k, let

pl : Rn → Ru1 + · · · + Rul

denote the orthogonal projection map onto the linear subspace of Rn generated by u1, . . . , ul.

n and u = (u1, . . . , uk) be a
Deﬁnition 4.5 ([5, Deﬁnition 3.1]). Let X be a closed subset of [0, 1]
k-tuple of pairwise orthogonal unital vectors in Rn. We say that u is a Bouligand-Severi tangent
of X at x of degree k, or simply a k-tangent of X at x, if X contains a sequence of points x1, x2, . . .
such that

(2) F 6⊇ conv(x, x + λ1u1, . . . , x + λ1u1 + · · · + λkuk);
(3) F ∩ X = S ∩ X.

We now recall the main result [5, Theorem 2.4].

Theorem 4.6. For any closed set X ⊆ [0, 1]

n the following conditions are equivalent:

(i) The MV-algebra M (X) is strongly semisimple.
(ii) The set X has no rationally outgoing k-tangent, for k = 1, . . . , n − 1.

g

The duality between SMV and Tc can be used to extend the above characterisation to any

strongly semisimple MV-algebra. We start by noticing the following crucial fact.

Lemma 4.7. An MV-algebra A is strongly semisimple if, and only if, each of its ﬁnitely generated
subalgebras are strongly semisimple.

Proof. It follows from [4, Proposition 4.1].

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.8. Given an MV-algebra A, the following statements are equivalent:

(i) Each ﬁnitely generated subalgebra of A is strongly semisimple.
(ii) The algebra A is semisimple and for each ﬁnite C ⊆ A, the set πA

C (W (A)) ⊆ [0, 1]

C does not

Proof. Since A is a ﬁnitely generated polyhedral MV-algebra, there exist a natural number n > 0
and a polyhedron P ∈ [0, 1]n such that A ∼= M (P ). Then P ∼= W (M (P )) ∼= W (A). Let
η : P → W (A) be a Z-homeomorphism. Then πA
C ◦ η is a Z-map. Since P is a polyhedron
πA
C ◦ η(P ) = πA
C (W (A)) is a polyhedron, for it is the image of a polyhedron under a

It is readily seen that being an inﬁnite dimensional (rational) polyhedron is preserved by Z-

Theorem 4.12. Given an MV-algebra A the following are equivalent:

g

Proof. (i)⇒(ii) We ﬁrst notice that by Lemma 4.8, A is strongly semisimple, hence semisimple.
Now, let C be a ﬁnite subset of A and B the subalgebra of A generated by C. By Lemma 3.14,
πA
C is Z-homeomorphic to W (B). By hypothesis B is strongly semisimple, so by
C (W (A)) ⊆ [0, 1]
Theorem 4.6, W (B) ∼= πA

C (W (A)) has no rationally outgoing k-tangent. Hence (ii) is proved.

(ii)⇒(i) Let C ﬁnite subset of A and B the subalgebra of A generated by C. Combining
C is Z-homeomorphic to W (B).

Lemma 3.14 and Remark 3.13, we have that πA
Then by Theorem 4.6, B is strongly semisimple if, and only if, πA
k-tangent. We conclude that (i) and (ii) are equivalent.

4.3. Polyhedral MV-algebras. An MV-algebra A is said ﬁnitely generated polyhedral if there
exist n ∈ N and a polyhedron P ⊆ Rn such that A ∼= M (P ). Finitely generated polyhedral MV
algebras were introduced in [3], were their main properties were proved. By deﬁnition polyhe-
dral MV-algebras are ﬁnitely generated. In this section, we use the duality between semisimple
MV-algebras and Tychonoﬀ spaces to extend the notion of polyhedron and ﬁnitely generated poly-
hedral MV-algebra to the non ﬁnitely generated case. Our deﬁnitions are based on the following
observation (see also Remark 3.5).

Lemma 4.10. Let A be a ﬁnitely generated polyhedral MV-algebra. Then for each ﬁnite C ⊆ A,
the set πA

C is a polyhedron.

(i) A is polyhedral;
(ii) A is semisimple and W (A) is a (inﬁnite dimensional) polyhedron;
(iii) each ﬁnitely generated subalgebra of A is polyhedral.

Proof. (i)⇔(ii). A is polyhedral if, and only if, there exists a, possibly inﬁnite dimensional,
polyhedron P such that A ∼= M (P ). In turn, this is equivalent to the fact that A is semisimple
and W (A) ∼= W (M (P )) ∼= P .

(ii)⇒(iii). Let B be the subalgebra of A generated by a ﬁnite subset C ⊆ A. If A is semisimple,
by Lemma 3.14 W (B) is Z-homeomorphic to πA

polyhedron, W (B) if a polyhedron, hence B is ﬁnite dimensional polyhedral. We conclude that A

Corollary 4.13. Every polyhedral MV-algebra is strongly semisimple.

Proof. By [3, Theorem 5.1], every ﬁnitely generated polyhedral MV-algebra is strongly semisimple.
So, combining Corollary 4.9 and Theorem 4.12 we obtain the statement.
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.14. An MV-algebra is polyhedral if, and only if, it is the direct colimit of ﬁnitely
generated polyhedral MV-algebras where transition maps are embeddings. Dually, a compact sub-
space of [0, 1]X is a (inﬁnite dimensional) polyhedron if, and only if, it is the direct limit of ﬁnite
dimensional polyhedra, with surjective Z-maps among them.

Proof. One direction is a direct consequence of the fact that every algebra is a direct colimit of its
ﬁnitely generated subalgebras with inclusions as transition maps and Theorem 4.12. For the other
direction, consider an MV-algebra A that is a colimit of a directed diagram of ﬁnitely generated
polyhedral MV-algebras (Ai, eij | i, j ∈ I) where eij : Ai → Aj is an embedding. Consider a
ﬁnitely generated subalgebra B of A, and let a1, ..., an its generators. As a1, ..., an belong to A
and the colimit maps are embeddings, there must be indices i1, ..., in ∈ I such that ak ∈ Aik .
Since the diagram is directed, there exists ¯i ∈ I with transition maps eik¯i : Aik → A¯i. Then, B is a
subalgebra of A¯i and the latter is polyhedral by hypothesis. So, by Theorem 4.12, B is polyhedral.
This concludes the proof of the equivalence. Finally, the second statement is equivalent to the
ﬁrst, modulo the duality of the previous section.
