We propose a smooth pseudopotential for the contact interaction acting between ultracold atoms
conﬁned to two dimensions. The pseudopotential reproduces the scattering properties of the re-
pulsive contact interaction up to 200 times more accurately than a hard disk potential, and in the
attractive branch gives a 10-fold improvement in accuracy over the square well potential. Further-
more, the new potential enables diﬀusion Monte Carlo simulations of the ultracold gas to be run 15
times quicker than was previously possible.

INTRODUCTION

discussing potential future applications of the pseudopo-
tential in Section VI.

Many collective quantum phenomena emerge from re-
duced dimensionality,
including the quantum Hall ef-
fect [1], high-temperature superconductivity [2], quan-
tum magnetism [3], and topological insulators [4]. Con-
sequently, two-dimensional (2D) systems have recently
attracted a great deal of attention [5–11]. 2D systems
may now be realized, for example, at the interface be-
tween two solids [12], or in an ultracold atomic gas in
an anisotropic optical trap, with one dimension tightly
conﬁned relative to the other two [13–15]. This coinci-
dence of novel many-body phenomena with accurate ex-
perimental realizations makes 2D systems attractive for
numerical investigation.

Ultracold atoms provide a clean model Hamiltonian
with a tunable interaction strength, and their study has
delivered new insights into many-body quantum physics
[16–19]. The resonant Feshbach interaction [20] between
ultracold atoms is usually modeled by a contact potential
[21–29]. Despite its widespread usage, the contact inter-
action causes sampling problems in numerical simulations
due to its inﬁnitesimally short range and divergence at
coalescence. It also harbors a bound state, complicating
the use of ground state methods for examining repulsive
scattering between particles. These diﬃculties are con-
ventionally circumvented by replacing the contact poten-
tial by, for example, a hard disk potential, which we show
leads to inaccurate scattering properties. This prob-
lem has recently been resolved in three dimensions by
Bugnion et al. with the development of a smooth pseu-
dopotential [30] that results in a hundred-fold increase in
the accuracy of the scattering properties. The smooth-
ness of the new pseudopotential also radically speeds up
numerical calculations [31, 32]. Here we follow that pre-
scription to develop a pseudopotential that improves the
modeling of 2D quantum gases with a contact interac-
tion.

In Section II we discuss two particles interacting via
the 2D contact potential.
In Section III we derive the
pseudopotential, and in Section IV demonstrate its accu-
racy in an inhomogeneous two-body system. In Section V
we examine the pseudopotential’s advantages over other
methods in a homogeneous many-body system, before

II. ANALYTICAL RESULTS

In order to develop a pseudopotential for use in many-
body simulations, it is essential to ﬁrst understand the
behavior of the two-particle system. Here we analyze
an isolated two-body system of distinguishable fermions,
starting with non-interacting particles and then adding a
short-ranged interaction potential, which not only allows
us to ﬁnd solutions for the contact interaction, but also
serves as a platform from which to propose a pseudopo-
tential. Atomic units ( = m = 1) are used throughout,
and anticipating that we will study many-body systems,
we measure energies in units of the Fermi energy EF and
lengths in units of the Fermi length k

A. Short-ranged two-particle interactions

We consider two equal-mass, distinguishable fermions
in a vacuum.
the
Schr¨odinger Equation for particles interacting via a po-
tential V (r) is given by

In their center-of-mass frame,

−∇2ψ(r, θ) + V (r)ψ(r, θ) = Eψ(r, θ),

(1)

where E is the energy in the center-of-mass frame.

The analytic solution to Equation (1)

for non-
interacting particles (V (r) = 0) in a vacuum takes the
form

ψ(cid:96)(r, θ) = R(cid:96)(r)Θ(cid:96)(θ)

with

Θ(cid:96)(θ) =

1
√2π

ei(cid:96)θ,

R(cid:96)(r) = A(k)J(cid:96)(kr) + B(k)Y(cid:96)(kr),

where k = √E is the wavevector in the center-of-mass
frame, (cid:96) is angular momentum projected onto the normal
to the 2D plane, and A(k) and B(k) are constants set by

the boundary conditions. J(cid:96)(kr) and Y(cid:96)(kr) are Bessel
functions of the ﬁrst and second kinds, respectively.

If we take the potential V (r) to be short ranged and
cylindrically symmetric, for distinguishable fermions the
only eﬀect of the potential is in the (cid:96) = 0 channel.
The wavefunction beyond the interaction range, where
V (r) = 0, then takes the same form as in the non-
interacting case,

ψ0(r) ∝ A(k)J0(kr) + B(k)Y0(kr).

(2)

There are two branches of solutions, scattering states for
E > 0 and bound states for E < 0.

1. Scattering states (E > 0)

For two-particle scattering with positive E, the non-
interacting wavefunction given by Equation (2) with k =
√E can be written at large separations in the oscillatory
form

sin(cid:0)kr + π

4 + δ(k)(cid:1)

ψs(r) ∝

√kr

,

(3)

where the scattering phase shift δ(k), given by

cot δ = −A(k)/B(k),

(4)

describes the large radius behavior of the wavefunction
and captures the full impact of the scattering interaction.

2. Bound states (E < 0)

Two particles with E < 0 are in a bound state in which
they remain in close proximity if no external force is ap-
plied. The bound state wavefunction has the form

ψb(r) ∝ A(κ)J0(iκr) + B(κ)Y0(iκr),

where κ = √−E. For the wavefunction to be normaliz-
able A and B must satisfy B(κ)/A(κ) = i, and therefore
the wavefunction

ψb(r) ∝ J0(iκr) + iY0(iκr)

∝ H (1)

0 (iκr),

(5)

0 (x) = J0(x) + iY0(x) is the Hankel function

where H (1)
0 (iκr) → e−κr/√κr as
of the ﬁrst kind. Note that H (1)
κr → ∞, with the expected exponential decay of a bound
state.

B. 2D contact interaction

We now apply these results for short-ranged 2D in-
teractions to the 2D contact interaction V cont(r). In a

Examples of a scattering and bound state wavefunction
are shown in Fig. 1. At large radii the scattering state
wavefunction takes the form of a wave, with the ﬁrst node
occurring at r = a in the k → 0 limit, whilst the bound
state wavefunction decays exponentially. Both wavefunc-
tions diverge at particle coalescence, which makes them
diﬃcult to sample in numerical methods. This motivates
us to develop a smooth pseudopotential for the contact
interaction, which will give rise to a wavefunction that is
easier to sample numerically.

PSEUDOPOTENTIALS

2. Soft disk potential

3

To develop smooth pseudopotentials for the contact in-
teraction we continue to investigate the two-particle sys-
tem in a vacuum, where the particles are distinguishable
fermions and an analytical solution exists. We ﬁrst fo-
cus on scattering states where, after reviewing the hard
and soft disk potentials that are commonly used in ultra-
cold atomic gas calculations, we construct a pseudopo-
tential using the method proposed by Troullier and Mar-
tins (TM) [35]. This method was originally developed
for making pseudopotentials for electron-ion interactions,
but has been successfully applied to other systems of in-
teracting particles [30, 32]. Next we construct another,
“ultratransferable”, pseudopotential (UTP) following the
method in Ref. [30]. We then compare the accuracy of
the TM and UTP pseudopotentials with that of the hard
and soft disk potentials. Finally, we develop pseudopo-
tentials for bound states. We have made the software
used to generate all the pseudopotentials in this work
available online [36].

A. Pseudopotentials for scattering states

1. Hard disk potential

Here we brieﬂy review the hard disk potential that is
currently used in many numerical studies of the contact
interaction [11, 21, 22]. The interaction potential has the
form

By setting the hard disk radius R equal to the scattering
length a, the low energy scattering phase shift from the
hard disk has the same form as the phase shift from the
contact potential in Equation (8). A hard disk potential
with R = a then gives the phase shift for the contact
interaction with an error of order O
the correct scattering properties only in the k → 0 limit.
An example of a hard disk potential is shown in Fig. 2.

(cid:0)(ka)2(cid:1), delivering

To reduce the error in the scattering phase shift at ﬁ-
nite k from that found with the hard disk, we may instead
use a soft disk potential [37]

V SD(r) =

U,
0,

r ≤ R,
r > R,

where U is the height of the soft disk potential. The
extra degree of freedom in this potential relative to the
hard disk allows it to remove the error in the scatter-
ing phase shift in Equation (9) of (kR)2/2π, and so de-
scribe the scattering correct to O
Schr¨odinger Equation using this potential separately in
the regions r < R and r > R, enforcing continuity of the
wavefunction and its derivative at r = R, and expanding
the scattering phase shift Equation (4) to second order
around k = 0. Setting the ﬁrst term equal to the contact
potential scattering phase shift of Equation (8) relates R
and the scattering length a via

(cid:18) I0 (χ)

(cid:19)

χI1 (χ)

,

R = aSD = a exp

(cid:0)(ka)4(cid:1). An example of a soft disk potential is

where I(cid:96)(χ) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst
kind, and the factor χ2 = U R2 ≈ 2.67 is obtained by set-
ting the second order term in the phase shift expansion
to zero. This uniquely speciﬁes a soft disk potential for
a given a, whose scattering properties are correct up to
order O
shown in Fig. 2. It has a larger radius R than the hard
disk potential but a lower height U , with the width tend-
ing to zero and the height to inﬁnity as the scattering
length goes to zero.

3. Troullier–Martins pseudopotential

The previous subsections showed that the hard and soft
disk potentials give accurate scattering properties only in
the limit of k → 0. However a Fermi gas contains all the
scattering wavevectors in the range 0 < k ≤ kF, and so
the hard and soft disk potentials will give rise to inac-
curate results. To demonstrate how the accuracy may
be improved at ﬁnite k, we develop pseudopotentials us-
ing the TM formalism [30, 35]. This formalism produces
scattering state pseudopotentials that

1. should reproduce the phase shift of the contact po-
tential accurately for all scattering wavevectors in
the Fermi sea;

2. are smooth everywhere, which accelerates numeri-

cal calculations; and

3. for repulsive interactions do not support a bound

state.

FIG. 2. (Color online) Scattering state pseudopotentials V (r)
for the contact potential with kFa = 1/2. The pseudopoten-
tial for the hard disc with radius a is shown in cyan, the soft
disk with radius aSD in blue, the TM pseudopotentials in red
and green, and the UTP in magenta. The pseudopotential
cutoﬀ radius rc is the same as in Fig. 1.

FIG. 3. (Color online) The error in the scattering phase shift
|δpseudo(k) − δcont(k)| as a function of scattering wavevector
for the diﬀerent pseudopotentials at kFa = 1/2. The error
from the hard disk is shown in cyan, the error from the soft
disk in blue, the errors from the two TM pseudopotentials in
red and green, and the error from the UTP in magenta.

This formalism requires two prescribed parameters,
namely the calibration wavevector kc at which the result-
ing pseudo-wavefunction has identical scattering proper-
ties to the contact potential, and a cutoﬀ radius rc at
which the pseudopotential smoothly becomes zero.

The calibration wavevector must be chosen for each
system. For example, in a superﬂuid we might choose
kc = kF, as that is where the most important physics of
Cooper pair formation occurs. For a fermionic gas we
choose kc = kF/2, which minimizes the average phase
shift error [32].

By choosing the cutoﬀ radius to be larger than the
radius of the ﬁrst node in the analytic wavefunction,
which is at r ≈ a in Fig. 1, we ensure that the pseudo-
wavefunction does not contain the innermost node that
corresponds to the bound state of the contact interaction
[30]. In order to avoid unnecessarily removing scattering
states from the potential the cutoﬀ radius must also be
smaller than the radius of the second node, and so we
choose the cutoﬀ radius to be at the ﬁrst antinode of the
wavefunction with k = kc, shown in Fig. 1.
The TM pseudopotential takes the form

V TM(r) =

where the polynomial p(r) =(cid:80)6

i=0 cir2i, and primes in-
dicate derivatives with respect to r. The coeﬃcients
{ci} are determined by a set of constraints on the
pseudopotential and pseudo-wavefunction, whose form
is ψ(r) = exp[p(r)] :
that the pseudo-wavefunction is
smooth up to the fourth derivative at rc; that the pseu-
dopotential has zero curvature at the origin; and that
the norm of the pseudo-wavefunction within rc equals
that of the wavefunction from the real contact potential
[30, 32, 35]. This gives rise to a set of coupled equa-
tions for the {ci} of which one is quadratic and the oth-
ers linear: there are therefore two separate branches of

solutions, which give rise to two separate TM pseudopo-
tentials.

In Fig. 2 we compare all of the discussed pseudopoten-
tials for the contact interaction, with kFa = 1/2. The
TM pseudopotentials, being everywhere smooth and ﬁ-
nite, are easier to work with numerically than the hard
and soft disks, and they do not introduce discontinuities
in the ﬁrst derivative of the wavefunction. The potential
labeled Troullier–Martins (1) in Fig. 2 is smaller than
Troullier–Martins (2) at particle coalescence, but larger
at further separations to give similar average scattering.

4. Errors in scattering phase shift

The quality of a pseudopotential for scattering states
may be determined by how accurately it reproduces the
phase shift of the contact potential. All information on
the diﬀerence between the pseudopotential and contact
potential can be obtained from the wavefunction just be-
yond the edge of the pseudopotential. We match the
analytical pseudo-wavefunction that solves Equation (1),
ψ, and its ﬁrst derivative to the non-interacting solu-
tion Equation (2) at a radius Re beyond the radius of
the pseudopotential. This leads to an expression for the
scattering phase shift

cot δ(k) =

(Re)

ψ(cid:48)
ψ(Re) Y0(kRe) + kY1(kRe)
ψ(cid:48)(Re)
ψ(Re) J0(kRe) + kJ1(kRe)

.

We calculate the diﬀerence in the phase shift between
the contact interaction and pseudopotentials, showing
the error in the calculated phase shifts from using the
pseudopotentials |δpseudo(k) − δcont(k)| in Fig. 3, with
Re = rc. The hard and soft disk potentials are exact
in the limit of k → 0, but deviate away from that point,
with the soft disk performing better than the hard disk.

as accurate as the hard disk potential, with the TM (2)
pseudopotential being around twice as accurate again,
and the soft disk being another 1.3 times more accurate.
Both TM pseudopotentials capture the scattering behav-
ior perfectly at kc = kF/2 but deviate at all other scat-
tering wavevectors, which is a consequence of the norm-
conserving condition on the pseudo-wavefunctions. To
further improve the accuracy of the pseudopotentials, a
natural extension to the formalism is to construct a pseu-
dopotential that minimizes this deviation in the phase
shift over all wavevectors k ≤ kF. We propose such a
pseudopotential here, referring to it as an “ultratransfer-
able pseudopotential” (UTP) [30].

5

B. Pseudopotentials for bound states

Pseudopotentials may also be constructed for particles
in a bound state, with E < 0.
In order to accurately
imitate the contact potential, the pseudopotentials must
reproduce the bound state energy of the contact poten-
tial Eb = −(4/a2) exp(−2γ), and also must accommo-
date only one bound state. We ﬁrst discuss the square
well pseudopotential, which has been used in previous ul-
tracold atomic gas calculations, and then again develop
smooth pseudopotentials using the TM formalism. For
bound states there is no quantity like the scattering phase
shift that can be used to directly determine the quality
of the pseudopotentials. We therefore demonstrate their
accuracy in a two-body inhomogeneous system in Sec-
tion IV.

5. Ultratransferable pseudopotential

1. Square well potential

Similarly to the TM pseudopotential, the UTP takes a

polynomial form within a cutoﬀ radius rc,

The square well potential has the form

with Nu = 3. The term (1 − r/rc)2 ensures that the
pseudopotential goes smoothly to zero at r = rc, and the
component u1(1 + 2r/rc) constrains the pseudopotential
to have zero derivative at the origin. This ensures that
the pseudo-wavefunction is smooth, easing the applica-
tion of numerical methods.

To determine the coeﬃcients {ui} we numerically solve
the scattering problem, extract the scattering phase shift
δUTP(k), and then minimize the total squared error in
the phase shift over all scattering wavevectors k,

An ex-
ample UTP is shown in Fig. 2, conﬁrming that this
construction gives smooth potentials. The scattering
phase shift error from the UTP is shown in Fig. 3,
demonstrating that the UTP construction creates pseu-
dopotentials that are signiﬁcantly more accurate than
the Troullier–Martins pseudopotentials and soft disk
potential, and some 200 times more accurate than the
hard disk. This is achieved by the phase shift error from
the UTP being optimized to be zero at three diﬀerent
wavevectors, as opposed to the single wavevector for the
TM pseudopotentials.

This potential may be made arbitrarily close to the
bound state contact interaction by taking the well ra-
dius R → 0 and depth U → ∞. Decreasing R, however,
reduces the sampling eﬃciency and thereby increases the
computational cost. We require R to be less than the av-
erage interparticle separation ∼ 1/kF, in order to avoid
the unphysical situation of three or more particles inter-
acting simultaneously. In Section IV we investigate the
R dependence of the accuracy of the square well pseu-
dopotential.

Because there is no analogue of the scattering phase
shift for the bound system it is not possible to uniquely
deﬁne a U and R for a given a, as we did for the soft disk
potential in which U and R were related by the second
order term in the expansion. However one parameter may
be determined by ensuring that the bound state energy
of the potential is Eb, and for a given R the value of U
this sets can be found as a solution to

where k1 =
of a square well potential is shown in Fig. 4. Except in
the limit of being inﬁnitely deep and narrow, the square
well potential does not give rise to the same wavefunction
as the true contact interaction, but within the potential
the wavefunction and therefore probability density is too
small. This means that in the presence of an external po-
tential (for example an harmonic trap, as in Section IV)
there is too much weight at large particle separations,
giving rise to inaccurate values of the system’s energy.
As R → 0 the wavefunction approaches the exact form
given by Equation (5).

2. Troullier–Martins pseudopotential

IV. TWO FERMIONS IN AN HARMONIC

TRAP

The Troullier–Martins pseudopotential resolves the
problem of having too much weight at large particle sepa-
rations by being a norm-conserving pseudopotential, and
so has the correct amount of weight within and outside
of its cutoﬀ radius. The construction of the TM pseu-
dopotential for the bound state is identical to that of
the scattering state, except that the calibration energy
is now given by the bound state energy Ec = Eb. The
cutoﬀ radius rc should be kept smaller than the average
interparticle separation ∼ 1/kF to reduce the probability
of three or more particles interacting at once, but there is
no lower bound on rc: similarly to the case of the square
well, reducing rc increases the accuracy but also the com-
putational cost of simulations. The square well and TM
pseudopotentials are shown in Fig. 4.

One of the TM pseudopotentials, labeled (1) in Fig. 4,
behaves as would be expected qualitatively for a short-
ranged potential giving rise to a bound state:
it has a
large negative region near particle coalescence. The other
TM solution, labeled (2) and shown in the inset to Fig. 4,
does not show this behavior, instead having an attractive
region at ﬁnite particle separation. This will give rise to
a non-zero expected separation between bound particles,
which is physically discordant with the contact interac-
tion. We therefore reject the TM (2) pseudopotential
because of its unphysical behavior and select the TM (1)
pseudopotential instead, referring to it henceforth simply
as the TM pseudopotential.

Since all particles in bound states have approximately
the same energy, the UTP formalism does not oﬀer any
advantage in this system. We now move on to testing the
pseudopotentials in an inhomogeneous two-body system.

We have constructed pseudopotentials that describe
the scattering behavior of two isolated fermions. To test
the pseudopotentials we turn to the experimentally re-
alizable [38, 39] system of two distinguishable fermions
in a circular harmonic trapping potential 1
4 ω2r2 of fre-
quency ω. This system also has the advantage of being
analytically soluble, which provides a stringent test for
the pseudopotentials that we will use in many-body sim-
ulations.

for two distinguishable fermions in an harmonic trap is

where the interparticle interaction term V cont(r)ψ can be

pulsive interaction strength g > 0 in Fig. 5 increases, the
energy increases and at g → ∞ joins onto the energy of
the attractive branch at g → −∞, in an analogue of uni-
tarity in the BEC-BCS crossover [41]. The bound state
of the contact potential survives in this inhomogeneous
system as the deep bound state at g > 0.

B. Accuracy of the pseudopotentials

We compare the estimates of the center-of-mass ener-
gies of two particles in an harmonic trap to the analytic
result in: Fig. 6(a), for repulsive interactions; Fig. 6(b)
for attractive interactions; and Fig. 6(c) for bound par-
ticles.

In the repulsive case, we ﬁnd that the hard and soft
disk potentials and TM pseudopotential are accurate
at small interaction strengths, but at large interaction
strengths the error in the calculated energies is greater
than 10%. The UTP pseudopotential is around 10 times
more accurate at high interaction strengths, and becomes
exact in the non-interacting limit.

To choose the radii of the potentials for the attrac-
tive and bound branches we follow the approach used
in Ref. [30] and use a TM pseudopotential with a cut-
c = 10−2, where n = ω/2π is the peak
oﬀ radius of nr2
density of two non-interacting particles in the trap. We
compare this to square wells with radii given by the same
nR2 = 10−2 and the smaller nR2 = 10−4 [29, 30]. We
note that in both the attractive and bound branches,
reducing the well radius increases the accuracy of the
square well potential, but that the TM pseudopotential
gives up to 10 times higher accuracy than a square well
with a radius 1/10 the size. The ability to use a larger
cutoﬀ radius with the TM pseudopotential brings signiﬁ-
cant beneﬁts in numerical sampling of the potential, with
the sampling eﬃciency expected to scale as ∼ r2
c . The
increased accuracy can be related to the fact that the
square well gives rise to wavefunctions with too much
weight at large particle separations, raising the energy
in the external trap, whilst the TM pseudopotential is
norm-conserving, having the correct weight in the wave-
function outside rc. The norm-conservation condition en-
sures that the TM pseudopotential gives a bound state
wavefunction that is robust against changes in the local
environment, and hence performs well in the spatially
varying harmonic trap. As opposed to the single calibra-
tion energy of the TM pseudopotential, in constructing
the UTP we would average over a range of energies. This
would oﬀer no advantage in the attractive and bound
branches, where there is a deﬁnite binding energy for the
pair of particles, and so we do not examine the UTP in
these branches.

We have shown that for particles in an harmonic
trap with attractive interactions, the TM pseudopoten-
tial gives an increase in both accuracy and sampling ef-
ﬁciency relative to the square well potential. For two

We now go on to demonstrate the scaling beneﬁts of the

FERMI GAS

Having demonstrated the eﬀectiveness of the UTP for
studying the two body scattering problem and two distin-
guishable fermions in an harmonic trap, we now demon-
strate the advantages of the UTP in a prototypical set-
ting: a two-dimensional homogeneous Fermi gas. Such a
system serves as a benchmark for cold atom experiments
[42, 43] and also as a model for electrons in conductors.
We focus on the repulsive branch of the contact interac-
tion. Here the hard and soft disk potentials are uniquely
deﬁned for a given interaction strength, and may not be
improved to attain arbitrarily high accuracy, as is possi-
ble in the attractive and bound branches by reducing the
well radius to zero. This allows us to demonstrate the in-
trinsic beneﬁts of the UTP formalism over the hard and
soft disk potentials.

The smoothness of the UTP relative to the hard and
soft disk potentials will be reﬂected in the many-body
wavefunction, which will make it easy to work with nu-
merically. Having shown in Section IV that the UTP is
more accurate than the competing hard and soft disk po-
tentials and Troullier–Martins pseudopotential, we pro-
ceed here to verify the accuracy of the UTP by compar-
ing the energy of a Fermi gas with ﬁrst- and second-order
perturbation theory calculations [44–46].

A. Formalism

To calculate the ground state energies we use the dif-
fusion Monte Carlo (DMC) technique. DMC is a highly-
accurate Green’s function projector method for determin-
ing ground state energies and expectation values [47–
49], and it is well-suited to investigating homogeneous
gaseous phases. We use the casino implementation [50]
of the DMC method with a Slater–Jastrow trial wave-
function Ψ = eJ D↑D↓, where D↑ (D↓) is a Slater de-
terminant of plane-wave states for the spin up (down)
channel. The Jastrow factor eJ describes correlations
between particles, with

where rij = |ri− rj| is the distance between two particles
with labels i and j, and uαβ are eighth-order polynomials,
whose parameters are optimized using variational Monte
Carlo subject to the symmetry requirements u↑↑ = u↓↓
and u↑↓ = u↓↑. Lc is a cutoﬀ length that we set equal to
the radius of a circle inscribed within the simulation cell,
and Θ is the Heaviside step function.

We calculate the ground state energy expectation value
for 49 spin-up and 49 spin-down particles in a homoge-
nous two-dimensional system for increasing interaction
strengths −1/ ln(kFa) up to a maximum value of 1.8 be-
fore the system would phase separate into a fully polar-

ized state. To accurately capture the hard disk wavefunc-
tion at small inter-particle distances in our DMC simu-
lations we add an additional term to the Jastrow factor
in Equation (11),

)], R < r < Lc,

(12)

r ≥ Lc,

as in Ref. [11], where R is the hard disk radius.
In
the present study the additional term applies to oppo-
site spins only.

We extrapolate to zero DMC timestep to obtain ac-
curate ground state energies. For each data point we
run three simulations with timesteps 0.25dt, 0.5dt, dt, [51]
with dt the maximum timestep in the linear regime, and
extrapolate to zero timestep by minimizing the weighted
least squares ﬁt. All error bars represent the DMC
stochastic error combined with the concomitant uncer-
tainty in the timestep extrapolation. We expect that the
use of a quadratic DMC algorithm would give similar
results [52, 53].

B. Results

In Fig. 7 we compare ground state energies of the Fermi
gas obtained using the diﬀerent potentials. It is clear that
for −1/ ln(kFa) > 0.7 both the hard and soft disk poten-
tials, as well as the Troullier–Martins pseudopotential,
are insuﬃcient to obtain the desired 10−4EF accuracy
that has been obtained in other DMC studies of homo-
geneous systems [30–32, 54].

To verify the DMC results we compare our estimates
for the ground state energy with perturbation theory [44–
46]. As can be seen in Fig. 7(b), ﬁrst order perturbation
theory E(1) = EF
2 (1 + [−1/ ln(kFa)]) deviates quadrat-
ically in the interaction strength −1/ ln(kFa) from the
UTP result as expected, and second order perturbation

scheme which is correct to order O
note that this indeed deviates cubically in interaction
strength from the UTP result. The agreement of the

with interaction strength when compared to these ana-
lytic results conﬁrms the accuracy of the UTP.

In addition to the analytic approximations, we com-
pare our DMC results with an independent study using
the hard disk potential and the same number of particles
in Ref. [22], labeled GB. We note that their predicted en-
ergies are higher than those from our DMC calculations

tential, whose height U also diverges as a → 0. However
for larger interactions the soft disk potential results in a
smoother wavefunction than the hard disk potential and
therefore has lower local energy variance. The variance
in the local energies diverges for the hard and soft disk
potentials for weak interactions, whereas it decays for
the UTP and TM pseudopotentials. The standard devi-
ation for the TM pseudopotential is slightly lower than
the UTP at all interaction strengths, which is understood
from the larger size of the potential for the UTP in Fig. 2
compared to the TM pseudopotential. This behavior is
similar to the 3D case reported in Ref. [30].

The reduced variance in the local energy lowers the
computational eﬀort T required for a DMC calculation,
which scales as T ∝ σ2
L/dt [31, 32, 55]. From Fig. 8 we see
that at intermediate interaction strength −1/ ln(kFa) =
0.8 the variance of the local energy for the UTP is 2.7 and
3.0 times lower than for the soft and hard disk potentials
respectively, corresponding to a speedup of 7.5 and 9.1.
In addition to the lower local energy variance, our
pseudopotentials oﬀer an additional speedup. The DMC
estimate of the energy must be extrapolated to zero
timestep, and the larger the region of linear depen-
dence of energy on timestep, the larger timestep can
be used. This reduces computational eﬀort even fur-
ther, as T ∝ 1/dt.
In Fig. 9 we observe that the ex-
tent of the linear regime of the error in ground state
energy with timestep diﬀers between the pseudopoten-
tials:

it extends up to dtHD = 1.25 × 10−3/EF for the
hard disk, up to dtSD = 2.5 × 10−3/EF for the soft disk,
up to dtUTP = 5.0 × 10−3/EF for the UTP, and up to
dtTM = 1.0 × 10−2/EF for the TM pseudopotential. This

means that the maximum timestep for a calculation with
the UTP is two and four times larger than for the soft
and hard disk potentials respectively. Combining this
with the reduced variance we therefore accomplish a to-
tal speedup of at least 15 times by using the UTP instead
of the hard and soft disks.

To summarize, we have demonstrated the importance

ergy from the result obtained with the UTP as a function

tial resummation of Feynman diagrams reported in Ref. [46],
shown in orange. GB is the Monte Carlo result from Ref. [22],

using the hard disk potential, and as DMC is a varia-
tional method this indicates that our trial wavefunction
is likely more accurate than was available to the authors
of Ref. [22], possibly due to our inclusion of a Jastrow
factor with variational parameters.

Having conﬁrmed the accuracy of the UTP we now
examine its performance beneﬁts. The local energy,
EL = Ψ−1 ˆHΨ, is a crucial quantity in DMC calculations
[50]. The stochastic error in a DMC calculation is pro-
portional to the standard deviation σL in the local energy
distribution, and therefore a smoother local energy will
give rise to more accurate results for the same computa-
tion time. Fig. 8 shows the standard deviation of the local
energy distribution of the trial wave function when using
all of our pseudopotentials. Both the UTP and TM pseu-
dopotentials beneﬁt from their smoothness in obtaining
a lower local energy standard deviation compared to the
hard and soft disk potentials. For weak interactions the
hard disk potential beneﬁts from an additional Jastrow
factor term, Equation (12), relative to the soft disk po-

UTP are over 10 times more accurate in the repulsive
branch of the interaction than is aﬀorded by the hard
and soft disk potentials used in recent studies. Moreover,
we have demonstrated that for many-body systems our
pseudopotential delivers a speedup of at least 15 times in
diﬀusion Monte Carlo computations, on top of the more
accurate result.

The performance and ease of construction of the pseu-
dopotential suggests that it could be widely applicable
across ﬁrst-principles methods beyond quantum Monte
Carlo. The pseudopotential formalism has already been
used to study the Coulomb [31] and dipolar [32] interac-
tions. Although in this work we have focused on using
the pseudopotential to accurately capture the scattering
properties of the contact interaction, our formalism al-
lows the further improvement of modeling of quantum
gases by calibrating the pseudopotentials to more accu-
rately describe the scattering properties of the underlying
Feshbach resonance interaction. To next lowest order in
scattering wavevector, this corresponds to including the
eﬀective range term essential for describing narrow Fesh-
bach resonances, which may exhibit exotic breached su-
perﬂuidity [56, 57], or other interactions with non-zero
eﬀective ranges, which are applicable in the study of nu-
cleon reactions [58]. Rather than a description in terms
of the scattering phase shift, the pseudopotentials could
instead be calibrated to other scattering properties. For
example, they could be calibrated to the cross-section for
elastic scattering measured experimentally via the ther-
malization rate, or the inelastic loss coeﬃcient, to capture
the full physical interaction between particles [20].

of using a pseudopotential with scattering properties that
accurately describe the contact interaction. For weak in-
teractions we observe that a divergence in the variance
in the local energy severely constrains the accuracy of
DMC simulations with soft or hard disk potentials. At
strong interactions these inaccurate potentials introduce
a signiﬁcant bias into the results, such that we were un-
able to attain the 10−4EF target accuracy in the ground
state energy. However the UTP delivers highly accurate
results over the full range of interaction strengths and
additionally oﬀers 15 times better computational perfor-
mance. We therefore recommend the UTP as an accurate
and eﬃcacious tool for studying the contact interaction
in 2D.

VI. DISCUSSION

We have developed a high-accuracy pseudopotential
for the contact interaction in 2D, building on the work of
Ref. [30]. We have demonstrated that our ultratransfer-
able pseudopotential provides accurate scattering phase
shifts, accurate energies for two harmonically conﬁned
particles, and we have demonstrated its advantages in
many-body simulations. The energies obtained with our
