Abstract:
In this article, we review a series of recent theoretical results regarding a
conventional approach to the dark energy (DE) concept. This approach is distinguished
among others for its simplicity and its physical relevance. By compromising General
Relativity (GR) and Thermodynamics at cosmological scale, we end up with a model without
DE. Instead, the Universe we are proposing is ﬁlled with a perfect ﬂuid of self-interacting
dark matter (DM), the volume elements of which perform hydrodynamic ﬂows. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time in a cosmological framework that the energy of the cosmic
ﬂuid internal motions is also taken into account as a source of the universal gravitational
ﬁeld. As we demonstrate, this form of energy may compensate for the DE needed to
compromise spatial ﬂatness, while, depending on the particular type of thermodynamic
processes occurring in the interior of the DM ﬂuid (isothermal or polytropic), the Universe
depicts itself as either decelerating or accelerating (respectively). In both cases, there is no
disagreement between observations and the theoretical prediction of the distant supernovae
(SNe) Type Ia distribution. In fact, the cosmological model with matter content in the form of
a thermodynamically-involved DM ﬂuid not only interprets the observational data associated
with the recent history of Universe expansion, but also confronts successfully with every
major cosmological issue (such as the age and the coincidence problems).
In this way,
depending on the type of thermodynamic processes in it, such a model may serve either
for a conventional DE cosmology or for a viable alternative one.

1. Introduction

2

During the last 20 years, a continuously growing list of observational data has veriﬁed the existence
of a distributed energy component in the Universe, i.e., one that does not seem to cluster at any scale.
This new constituent of the cosmic matter-energy content was termed dark energy [1,2]; a reﬂection of
our ignorance on its exact nature, the determination of which has become one of the biggest problems in
theoretical physics and cosmology (for a review of the various DE models see, e.g., [3]). Let us brieﬂy
review how did we get to this point.

It all begun in the late 1990s, when high-precision distance measurements revealed that, in a dust
Universe, the far-off light-emitting sources look fainter (in other words, their actual distance is larger)
than what is theoretically predicted [4–30]. To compromise theory with observation, Perlmutter et al. [2]
and Riess et al. [9] admitted that the value of the long-sought cosmological constant, Λ, is no longer
zero (in connection, see [31]). In this case, along with its mass content, the Universe is ﬁlled also with
an extra, uniformly distributed amount of energy.

At the same time, detailed observational studies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
suggested that the post-recombination Universe can be described (to high accuracy) by a spatially-ﬂat
Robertson-Walker (RW) model [32–40]. This means that the overall energy density, ε, of the Universe
matter-energy content, in units of the critical energy density, εc = ρcc2 (the equivalent to the critical
rest-mass density, ρc = 3H 2
8πG, where H0 is the Hubble parameter at the present epoch, G is Newton’s
gravitational constant, and c is the velocity of light), must be very close to unity, Ω = ε
εc ≃ 1, i.e., much
larger than the (most recently) measured value of the density parameter, ΩM = ρ
= 0.279 [41]. Once

again, an extra amount of energy was needed, this time, in order to compromise spatial ﬂatness.

The particle-physics vacuum does contribute a uniformly distributed energy component, which could
serve as an effective cosmological constant and justify spatial ﬂatness [42]. Unfortunately, vacuum
energy is 10123 times larger than what is currently inferred by observations (see, e.g., [43]). Clearly,
to reconcile spatial ﬂatness with the observed dimming of the cosmological standard candles, another
approach, i.e., other than the cosmological constant, was needed.

As a consequence, several physically-motivated models have appeared in the literature, such as,
models with scalar ﬁelds [44,45], phantom cosmology [46], tachyonic matter [47], braneworld scenarios
[48,49], scalar-tensor theories [50], f (R)-gravity [51], holographic gravity [52–54], Chaplygin gas
[55–58], Cardassian cosmology [59–61], models with extra (i.e., more than four) dimensions [62–65],
neutrinos of varying mass [66,67], and many others (see, e.g., [68]). However, most of these models
are suffering by the (old) cosmological-coincidence problem. According to it, a viable DE model
should be able (also) to explain why we live so close to the transition era; the inﬂection point being
(observationally) set at a rather low value of the cosmological redshift parameter, z, the so-called
transition redshift, ztr = 0.752±0.041 [30]. Of course, we should mention that, it is not completely clear
how much the transision redshift depends (or not) either on the speciﬁc cosmological model used [69,70]
or on the particular theory of gravitation that is taken into account [71–73]. In other words, for the time
being, ztr cannot be measured in a model-independent way; and this is where, usually, cosmography
takes over [74].

In view of the cosmographic approach, all quantities of interest are expanded as Taylor series
around their present-time values, with the corresponding coefﬁcients being directly related to several
parameters of cosmological signiﬁcance [75]. In other words, cosmography is a technique for matching
cosmological data with observable quantities without imposing a particular cosmological model. In view
of the large number of speculative models presently being considered, such an observationally-driven
approach is of interest in its own right; hence, many cosmographic efforts to resolve the controversy on
the exact nature of the cosmic ﬂuid have appeared in the literature (see, e.g., [76–97]).

In the meantime, much evidence in favour of a dark (energy) component in the Universe matter-energy
content had been accumulated, also from observations of galaxy clusters [98], the integrated Sachs-Wolfe
(ISW) effect [99], baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) [100,101], weak gravitational lensing (WGL)
[102,103], and the Lyman-α (LYA) forest [104]. For the ﬁrst time since the early 1930s, observation
was prevailing over theory. As a consequence, many alternative interpretations to the DE concept also
appeared in the literature (see, e.g., [105–108]), although a dark component was already present in the
Universe matter content.

Indeed, nowadays, there is too much evidence in favour of a non-baryonic mass component in the
Universe matter content. This evidence includes high-precicion measurements of the ﬂattened galactic
rotation curves [109,110], the WGL of distant galaxies by (some dark) foreground structure [111], and
the weak modulation of strong lensing around individual massive elliptical galaxies [112]. On the scale
of galaxies, recent observational data indicate that the (dark) galactic haloes extend almost half the
distance to the neighboring galaxies [113,114]. On larger scales, it has been found that the total-mass
of galaxy clusters is almost ten times higher than its baryonic counterpart [115–117], while, analogous
conclusions can be deduced also at the universal level, from the combination of CMB measurements
[39] with those concerning light-chemicals abundances [118]. Accordingly, more than 85% of the mass
in the Universe consists of non-luminous DM [119].

The precise nature of the DM constituents is still a matter of debate. One of the most attractive
candidates are the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)—a by-product of the Universe hot
youth [120–122]. These particles are quite relevant to the direct or/and indirect detection of DM,
due to their connection to standard-model particles [123–125]. However, for such a candidancy only
weak-scale physics is involved, and, therefore, cosmologists used to argue that the WIMPs are practically
collisionless. However, recent results from high-energy particle detectors [126,127], combined with
data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) [128], have revealed an unexplained
positron excess in the Universe, which could be related to interactions between DM particles (see, e.g.,
[129–139]). In other words, the WIMPs can be slightly collisional [140–144].

A collisional-DM model could reconcile DM and DE in terms of a single component, thus arising as
a relatively inexpensive solution to the DE problem (see, e.g., [145–158]). In this framework, Kleidis
and Spyrou [159,160], proposed a classical approach to the DE concept, in terms of a phenomenological
model, in which the Universe matter content possesses (also) some sort of thermodynamic properties.
Indeed, in view of the CMB-based spatial ﬂatness, today, the Universe should contain a much larger
amount of energy than what is attributed to the total rest-mass of its matter content. This, however, would
have no longer been a problem, if the dominant component of the Universe matter content (i.e., DM) was
represented by a thermodynamically-involved ﬂuid, in which, the extra energy needed to compromise

Entropy 2016, 18

4

spatial ﬂatness is attributed to the energy of its internal motions. Notice that, the same assumption has
been proved very useful in modeling dark galactic haloes, leading to a signiﬁcant improvement of the
galaxies velocity dispersion proﬁles [161–167].

It is therefore worth examining the properties of a cosmological model, in which, in principle, there
is no DE at all. Instead, we assume that the evolution of this model is driven by collisional-DM, i.e., a
cosmic ﬂuid with thermodynamical content. In this case, the fundamental constituents of the Universe
matter content are the volume elements of this ﬂuid, performing hydrodynamic ﬂows. We distinguish
two types of thermodynamic processes in it, namely, (i) isothermal ﬂows [159] and (ii) polytropic ﬂows
[160]. In both cases, the energy of the DM ﬂuid internal motions is also taken into account as a source
of the universal gravitational ﬁeld, thus compensating for the extra DE needed to compromise spatial
ﬂatness. In such a cosmological model, there is no disagreement between the theoretical prediction and
the observed distrubution of the distant SNe Ia, while neither the age problem nor the corresponding
coincidence one ever rise.

This review article is organized as follows: In Section 2, we consider a spatially-ﬂat Universe, the
evolution of which is driven by a (perfect) ﬂuid of self-interacting (i.e., thermodynamically-involved)
DM. Accordingly, in Section 3, we focus on the special case where the volume elements of this ﬂuid
perform isothermal ﬂows [159]. In this case, an extra DE amount arises naturally—being represented by
the energy of the internal motions of the DM ﬂuid—although the Universe is ever-decelerating. However,
what we really need to query about is, what is realized by an observer who - although living in such a
model—mistreats DM as collisionless dust. As we shall demonstrate, for such an observer, besides the
need for a DE amount (to compromise spatial ﬂatness), every cosmologically-distant indicator appears
to be fainter (i.e., its actual distance is larger) than what is theoretically predicted, and the late Universe
is accelerating. Although intriguing, this alternative model has a delicate point: It is compatible with
observations, only if the matter content of the dark sector consists of hot DM (HDM). However, pure
HDM models can not reproduce the observed large-scale structure of the Universe [168], in contrast
to their cold DM (CDM) counterparts [169]. In an effort to confront with this issue, in Section 4, we
consider that the dominant type of process occuring in the interior of the (cosmic) DM ﬂuid is polytropic
ﬂow [160]. Once again, the extra DE needed to compromise spatial ﬂatness is represented by the internal
energy of the ﬂuid. The polytropic (DM) model depends on one free parameter, the polytropic exponent,
Γ. For Γ ≤ 0.540 the pressure of the cosmic ﬂuid is deﬁnitely negative, and the Universe does accelerate
its expansion, below a transition value of the cosmological redshift, ztr. In fact, the polytropic DM model
can confront with almost every major cosmological issue, such as the age and the coincidence problems,
while reproducing to high accuracy the observed distribution of the SNe Ia standard candles. Finally, we
conclude in Section 5.

2. Collisional-DM Cosmology

In view of the CMB observational data released at the dawn of the 21st century (see, e.g., [32–36]),
the post-recombination Universe is described by a spatially-ﬂat RW model, the line element of which is
given by

ds2 = S2(η)(cid:2)c2dη2 −(cid:0)dx2 + dy2 + dz2(cid:1)(cid:3) ,

(1)

Entropy 2016, 18

where η is conformal time, and S(η) is the scale factor. As a consequence, the value of the Hubble
parameter at the present epoch is, by deﬁnition, given by

H 2

ρc

(2)

(see, e.g., [170] (p. 77)). The evolution of model (1) depends on the nature of the source that drives the
universal gravitational ﬁeld, i.e., its matter-energy content.

According to Kleidis and Spyrou [159,160], along the lines of the collisional-DM approach, we

properties, in the sense that, the collisions of WIMPs maintain a tight coupling between these particles,
so that their kinetic energy is re-distributed. Under this assumption, the DM acquires some sort of
thermodynamical content, and, therefore, the evolution of the post-recombination Universe is no longer
driven by pressureless dust, but by a ﬂuid, which, in view of the cosmological principle, should (rather)
be practically homogeneous and isotropic at large scale. The pressure of this (perfect) ﬂuid is accordingly
given by a barotropic equation of state,

p = f (ρ) ,

(3)

where ρ is the rest-mass density, i.e., the part equivalent to the energy density ρc2 that remains unaffected
by the internal motions of the cosmic ﬂuid. Now, the fundamental units of the Universe matter content
are the volume elements of the collisional-DM ﬂuid (elements of ﬂuid, each one consisting always of the
same number of particles).

In the context of GR, the motions of volume elements in the interior of a continuous medium are

governed by the equations

T µν

;ν = 0 ,

(4)

where Greek indices refer to the four-dimensional spacetime, Latin indices refer to the three-dimensional
spatial slices, the semicolon denotes covariant derivative, and T µν is the energy-momentum tensor of the
Universe matter content. In the particular case of a perfect ﬂuid, T µν admits the standard form

T µν = (ε + p)uµuν − pgµν ,

(5)

where uµ = dxµ
ds is the four-velocity (uµuµ = 1) at the position, xµ, of a ﬂuid volume element, gµν are
the contravariant components of the Universe metric tensor, and ε is the total energy density of the ﬂuid.
In an ideal equilibrium state (i.e., in the absence of shear and viscocity), ε is decomposed to

ε = E(ρ, T ) + ρ U(T )

(6)

(see, e.g., [171] (pp. 81–84 and 90–94)). In Equation (6), T is the absolute temperature and U is the
energy of this ﬂuid internal motions, thus deﬁning ρ U as the corresponding (speciﬁc) energy density. In
this framework, E(ρ, T ) represents every form of energy (density) involved, other than that of internal
motions (e.g., due to the rest-mass content, heat exchange, etc.). Along these lines, Equation (4) represent
the hydrodynamic ﬂows of the volume elements in the interior of a perfect-ﬂuid source.

However, in a maximally symmetric cosmological setup, an observer comoving with the cosmic
expansion also traces the hydrodynamic ﬂow of the spatially-homogeneous cosmic ﬂuid and the Weyl
postulate is valid (see, e.g., [172] (p. 91)). Accordingly, the dynamical evolution of the cosmological

Entropy 2016, 18

6

model with line element given by Equation (1) is governed by the equation of the classical (i.e., for
Λ = 0) Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology

where

H 2 =

8πG
3c2 ε ,

H =

(7)

(8)

is the Hubble parameter as a function of the scale factor, and the prime denotes differentiation with
respect to η. As regards Equation (7), we need to stress that there is an essential difference between
our (thermodynamical) model and the rest of the classical FRW cosmologies, since, in this case, the
basic matter constituents are no longer particles receding from each other, but the volume elements of
the collisional-DM ﬂuid, which possess some sort of internal structure and, hence, thermodynamical
content. Therefore, the functional form of ε in Equation (7) is no longer given by ρc2 alone, but by
Equation (6) (in connection, see also [172] (pp. 61–62)). Accordingly, we need to determine E and U.
To do so, we address (i) to the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics in curved spacetime,

d U + pd(cid:18)1

ρ(cid:19) = CdT

(see, e.g., [171] (p. 83)), where C is the speciﬁc heat of the cosmic ﬂuid, and (ii) to the conservation
;ν = 0, which, in terms of the metric tensor, gµν, associated to Equation (1), results in the
law of GR, T 0ν
continuity equation

ε′ + 3

(ε + p) = 0 .

(10)

Now, in order to proceed further, we need to decide on the type of processes that take place in the
interior of the cosmic (DM) ﬂuid, i.e., to determine the functional form of the equation of state given by
Equation (3). To do so, we distinguish two cases, namely, (i) isothermal ﬂows [159] and (ii) polytropic
ﬂows [160]. We consider each one of these cases, separately.

3. Isothermal Processes in a Cosmological DM Fluid

In the case where the volume elements of the cosmic ﬂuid perform isothermal ﬂows, we have
dT = 0 = dQ, and, hence, E = ρc2. Accordingly, the DM (always entangled with the small baryonic
contamination) constitutes a gravitating perfect ﬂuid with equation of state

p = wρc2 ,

(11)

cs, in units of c2. For dT = 0, the ﬁrst law of Thermodynamics Equation (13) results in [173]

c(cid:1)2 ≤ 1 is a dimensionless constant, which measures the square of the speed of sound,

where 0 ≤ w =(cid:0) cs

(9)

(12)

(13)

where ρ0 and U0 are the present-time values of rest-mass density and internal-energy density,
respectively. By virtue of Equation (12), the total energy density of the Universe matter-energy content
is written in the form

U = U0 + wc2 ln(cid:18) ρ

ρ0(cid:19) ,

ε = ρc2(cid:20)1 + U0

ρ0(cid:19)(cid:21)
c2 + w ln(cid:18) ρ

Entropy 2016, 18

and the continuity Equation (10) yields

S(cid:19)3
ρ = ρ0(cid:18)S0

,

7

(14)

where S0 is the present-time value of the scale factor. Accordingly, in the isothermal case, the Friedmann
Equation (7) reads

H0(cid:19)2
(cid:18) H

= ΩM(cid:18)S0

S(cid:19)3(cid:20)1 + U0

c2 + 3w ln(cid:18)S0

S(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

where we have used also Equation (2). At the present epoch (when S = S0 and H = H0), Equation (15)
is reduced to

U0 =

1 − ΩM
ΩM

c2

(16)

and, therefore, from Equation (6) we ﬁnd that, in a cosmological model with matter content in the form
of an isothermal DM ﬂuid, the present-time value of the overall-energy density parameter is exactly
unity, i.e.,

Ω0 =

ε0
εc

=

ρ0c2
ρcc2 +

ρ0U0
ρcc2 = ΩM + ΩM U0

c2 = 1 .

(17)

In other words, the (extra) DE needed to ﬂatten the Universe can be represented by the energy of the

internal motions of the isothermal DM ﬂuid (iDMF model).

By virtue of the present-time value of the internal energy given by Equation (16), Equation (15) results

H0(cid:19)2
(cid:18) H

=(cid:18)S0

S(cid:19)3(cid:20)1 + 3wΩM ln(cid:18)S0

S(cid:19)(cid:21) .

The Friedmann Equation (18) that determines the evolution of the iDMF model, can become very
useful, if we take into account that, since 0 ≤ w ≤ 1 and ΩM = 0.274 [40], the combination wΩM
can be quite small, i.e., wΩM ≪ 1. Accordingly, to terms linear in wΩM , Equation (18) is written in
the form

,

(19)

which, by virtue of Equation (8), can be solved analyically, to determine the scale factor of the iDMF
model, as follows

is the present-time value of the conformal time. For w 6= 0, Equation (20) is the natural generalization
of the Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) model (S ∼ η2) (see, e.g., [170] (pp. 77, 83 and 142–144)), i.e., of the
collisionless-DM counterpart of the iDMF model.

Now, upon consideration of the cosmological redshift parameter,

z + 1 =

S

,

(22)

Entropy 2016, 18

Equation (19) can be cast in the form

H = H0(1 + z)

3

2 (1+wΩM ) .

8

(23)

In view of Equation (23), on the approach to the present epoch (when z = 0), H(z) decreases
monotonically. In other words, the cosmological model ﬁlled with an isothermal DM ﬂuid decelerates
its expansion. Indeed, in the iDMF model the deceleration parameter,

(cf. Equation (16) of [174]), yields

q(z) =

dH/dz
H(z)

(1 + z) − 1

q(z) =

(1 + 3wΩM ) > 0 ,

(24)

(25)

independently of z, even if w = 0. In other words, the iDMF model cannot confront with the apparent
accelerated expansion of the Universe. The actual reason is that, it does not have to. As we shall
demonstrate in Section 3.1, in a cosmological model with matter content in the form of isothermal (DM)
ﬂuid, both the observed dimming of the distant SNe Ia and the apparent accelerated expansion of the
Universe can be due to the misinterpretation of several cosmological parameters, by those observers
who, although living in the iDMF model, insist on adopting the collisionless-DM approach.

3.1. Mistreating DM as Collisionless

In the late 1990s, the scientiﬁc community was assured that the Universe is ﬁlled with collisionless
DM, i.e., mainly, dust. Then, high-precision distance measurements performed with the aid of SNe Ia
events, revealed the unexpected acceleration of the cosmic expansion. However, the physical content of
a dust Universe is entirely different from that of a collisional-DM model. In other words, the dynamical
properties of a pressureless Universe are no longer described by the metric tensor gµν, associated to
Equation (1), but, rather, in terms of another metric tensor, ˜gµν. Clearly, someone who (mis)treats DM
as dust, relies on ˜gµν in interpreting observations. For such an observer, the accumulated evidence in
favour of spatial ﬂatness, not only implies that the spacetime line element is written in the form

d˜s2 = ˜S2(η)(cid:2)c2dη2 −(cid:0)dx2 + dy2 + dz2(cid:1)(cid:3) ,

(26)

but, also, suggests that there is a deﬁcit (1 − ΩM ) in the universal energy budget. On the contrary, in
the iDMF approach, the extra energy amount needed to compromise Ω0 = 1 is already included in the
model, being represented by the energy of the internal motions of the thermodynamically-involved DM
ﬂuid. Furthermore, on interpreting the dimming of the cosmologically-distant SNe Ia events, a supporter
of the collisionless-DM scenario is also based on ˜gµν and the cosmological parameters arising from it,
hence, a possible explanation for such a dimming could be that, recently, the Universe accelerated its
expansion [7,9]. We cannot help but wondering, what would be the explanation within the context of the
iDMF model.

In search of such an explanation, we note that, according to Kleidis and Spyrou [175] the
collisional-DM treatment of the Universe matter-energy content (in terms of which, in principle, p 6= 0)

Entropy 2016, 18

9

can be related to the collisionless-DM approach (in terms of which, necessarily, ˜p = 0) by a conformal
transformation,

˜gµν = f 2(xκ) gµν

(27)

(see also [176,177] (pp. 24–29 and 54–61), [178,179]), where, upon consideration of isentropic ﬂows,
the conformal factor, f (xκ), is given by [175]

ρc2 (cid:19)
f (xκ) = C(cid:18) ε + p

(28)

corresponding to the speciﬁc enthalpy of the ideal ﬂuid under consideration (C is an integration
constant). More recently, Verozub showed that Equations (27) and (28) apply to every Riemannian
spacetime, and not just to the metric tensor associated with a perfect ﬂuid source [180].

With the aid of Equations (27) and (28), we can now determine the scale factor ˜S(η), i.e., the scale
factor of the Universe as it is realized by someone who, although living in the iDMF model, mistreats
DM as collisionless. By virtue of Equation (27),

where, in terms of z, f (xκ) is given by [159]

˜S(η) = f (xκ)S(η) ,

f (z) = 1 + wΩM [1 + 3 ln(1 + z)] .

(29)

(30)

Upon consideration of Equations (29) and (30), we can express several cosmological parameters of
the iDMF model, in terms of their collisionless-DM counterparts. In this framework, the cosmological
redshift parameter, ˜z, as deﬁned by a supporter of the collisionless-DM scenario, is given by

˜z + 1 =

˜S(η0)
˜S(η)

=

1 + wΩM

1 + wΩM [1 + 3 ln(1 + z)]

(z + 1) ,

which, to linear terms in wΩM ≪ 1, results in

1 + ˜z ≃ (1 + z)1−3wΩM .

(31)

(32)

Equation (32) suggests that, for every value of z, i.e., the cosmological redshift as it is deﬁned in
the iDMF model, the corresponding collisionless-DM quantity, ˜z, is always a little bit smaller (˜z <
z). In other words, on observing a standard candle in the iDMF model, an observer who adopts the
collisionless-DM approach infers that it lies farther (z) than expected (˜z).

3.2. Accomodating the Recent SNe Ia Data in a Decelerating Universe

One of the most reliable methods to monitor the Universe expansion, is to measure the redshift and
the apparent magnitude, m, of cosmologically-distant SNe Ia events (standard candles), whose absolute
magnitude, M, is well-known [5–9]. In an effort to determine the distribution of these events in curved
spacetime, a number of scientiﬁc groups found evidence in favour of a recent accelerating stage of the
Universe expansion [6–30].
Indeed, in all of these surveys, the SNe Ia events (at peak luminocity)
look fainter (i.e., their actual distance is larger) than what is theoretically predicted. This result led

Entropy 2016, 18

the scientiﬁc community to admit that, recently, the Universe (driven by an exotic DE ﬂuid of negative
pressure) accelerated its expansion (see, e.g., [37]). However, in view of Equation (32), there may be
another, more conventional interpretation.

To begin with, we note that photons travel along null geodesics, d˜s2 = 0 = ds2, which remain
unaffected by conformal transformations. Consequently, both in the collisional-DM treatment and in the
collisionless-DM approach, the radial distance of a particular SN Ia event is the same, i.e., ˜r = r. In
this case, upon consideration of Equation (32), the actually-measured (in a spatially-ﬂat iDMF model)
luminosity distance,

can be expressed in terms of the corresponding collisionless-DM quantity,

dL(z) = rS(η0)(1 + z) ,

as follows

˜dL(˜z) = ˜r ˜S(η0)(1 + ˜z) ,

dL
˜dL

=

1

1 + wΩM

(1 + z)3wΩM .

(33)

(34)

(35)

According to Equation (35),

in the iDMF Universe,

there exists a characteristic value of the

actually-measured cosmological redshift, namely,

zc = (1 + wΩM )

1

3wΩM − 1 ,

(36)

such that, for z > zc, dL > ˜dL.
In other words, an observer who—although living in the iDMF
model—treats DM as dust, infers that any SN Ia event located at z > zc lies farther than what is
theoretically predicted. By virtue of zc, an inﬂection point (on the dL versus z diagram) arises naturally
in the iDMF model, without the need to assume any transition from deceleration to acceleration. In other
words, the iDMF model does not suffer from the coincidence problem.

Now, we shall demonstrate that, in fact, there is no discrepancy between theoretical prediction
and the observed distribution of the distant SNe Ia in the iDMF model. To do so, we overplot
the theoretically-determined distance modulus (of a light-emitting source in the iDMF model) on the
Hubble (µ versus z) diagram of the sample of 192 SN Ia events used by Davis et al. [181] (Available at
http://braeburn.pha.jhu.edu/∼ariess/R06). In what follows, we admit that H0 = 70.2 Km/sec/Mpc [40]
and hence 2c/H0 = 8, 547 Mpc.

In the iDMF model, the distance modulus of a cosmologically-distant indicator is given by

µ(z) = 5 log(cid:20) dL(z)

Mpc(cid:21) + 25 = m(z) − M ,

where dL is measured in megaparsecs (Mpc). In a similar manner,

˜µ(˜z) = 5 log" ˜dL(˜z)

Mpc# + 25

(37)

(38)

is the theoretical formula associated to the distance modulus of the same source, as it is deﬁned by
someone who, although living in the iDMF model, insists on adopting the (traditional) collisionless-DM
approach. In this case, using Equation (36), we obtain

µ − ˜µ = 15wΩM log(1 + z) − 5 log (1 + wΩM ) .

(39)

Entropy 2016, 18

11

According to Equation (39), any light-emitting source of the iDMF model that is located at z >
zc, from the point of view of an observer who treats DM as collisionless, appears to be dimmer than
expected, i.e., ˜µ < µ. Therefore, if the cosmic DM amount is interpreted as an isothermal ﬂuid, then, it
is possible that the discrepancy between the expected value of the distance modulus (˜µ) of a distant SN
Ia and the corresponding observed one (µ), arises only because some cosmologists (although living in
the iDMF model) insist on treating DM as dust.

In order to overplot Equation (38) on the µ versus z diagram of the SN dataset used by
Davis et al. [181], ﬁrst, we need to determine the luminosity distance ˜dL(˜z), inferred by someone who
treats DM as dust, and, second, to express this function in terms of the actually-measured quantity, z.
A supporter of the collisionless-DM scenario, necessarily performs calculations in the framework of the
EdS Universe, in which the luminosity distance is given by

According to Kleidis and Spyrou [159], in the context of the iDMF approach, Equation (40) is

˜dL(˜z) =

2c
˜H0

(1 + ˜z)1/2 h(1 + ˜z)1/2 − 1i .

(40)

(41)

(42)

translated to

˜dL(z) =

2c

(1 − 4wΩM ) H0

(1 + z)

1

2 (1−3wΩM )h(1 + z)

1

2 (1−3wΩM ) − 1i .

However, in depicting Equation (38) on the µ versus z diagram of a sample of SNe events, an observer
who treats DM as collisionless, unavoidably misinterprets the measured quantity z as ˜z (also, the
present-time value of the Hubble parameter, H0, is misinterpreted as ˜H0). In other words, the theoretical
formula of the luminosity distance that is used by someone who treats DM as dust, is (falsely) written in
the form

˜dL(˜z) =

2c
H0

(1 + z)1/2 h(1 + z)1/2 − 1i ,

instead of that given by the combination of Equations (35) and (41). This is most prominently
demonstrated in Figure 1, where, on the Hubble diagram of the SNe Ia dataset used by Davis et al. [181],
we have overplotted the theoretically determined (in the context of the iDMF model) function µ(z), for
three values of the combination wΩM , namely, wΩM = 0.10 (red solid line), wΩM = 0.16 (green solid
line) and wΩM = 0.19 (blue solid line), together with the corresponding collissionless-DM quantity,
˜µ(z) (dashed line). We observe that, when the thermodynamical content of the iDMF model is taken into
account, the theoretically-determined distance modulus ﬁts the entire SNe dataset under consideration
quite accurately.

We see that, in the iDMF framework, provided that cosmologists no longer insist on adopting
the collisionless-DM approach, the observed dimming of the SNe Ia standard candles would be only
apparent. In other words, in the iDMF model there is no disagreement between observations and the
theoretical prediction of the distant SNe Ia distribution.

3.3. The Apparent Acceleration of the iDMF Model

According to Kleidis and Spyrou [159], the Hubble parameter that is realized by a supporter of the

collisionless-DM scenario, ˜H, is given by

Figure 1. Overplotted on the Hubble diagram of the SNe Ia sample used by Davis et al.
[181], are the theoretical curves of the distance modulus in the iDMF model, µ(z), for
wΩM = 0.10 (red solid line), wΩM = 0.16 (green line), and wΩM = 0.19 (blue solid
line). The dashed line represents the theoretical curve associated to the distance modulus in
the context of the collisionless-DM approach.

where we have used also Equations (23) and (30). With the aid of Equation (32), ˜H(z) can be expressed
in terms of ˜z, as follows

˜H = H0 (1 + ˜z)

3(1+wΩM )

2(1−3wΩM ) (1 − 3wΩM )

1 − 5wΩM + 3wΩM ln(1 + ˜z) + O(wΩM )2
[1 − 2wΩM + 3wΩM ln(1 + ˜z) + O(wΩM )2]2 .

In the context of the collisionless-DM approach the deceleration parameter, ˜q, is deﬁned as

˜q(˜z) =

d ˜H/d˜z
˜H(˜z)

(1 + ˜z) − 1,

which, upon consideration of Equation (44), yields

˜q(˜z) =

1 − 10wΩM + 6wΩM ln(1 + ˜z) + O(wΩM )2(cid:21) .

To terms linear in wΩM, the condition for accelerated expansion, ˜q(˜z) < 0, results in

1 − 14wΩM + 12wΩM ln(1 + ˜z) < 0 ,

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

from which it is evident that, as far as a supporter of the collisionless-DM scenario is concerned, ˜q(˜z) < 0
at cosmological redshifts

˜z < ˜ztr = e

14wΩM −1

12wΩM − 1.

(48)

Entropy 2016, 18

Equation (48) suggests that, if the Universe matter content is treated as an isothermal DM ﬂuid with

(49)
(i.e., w > wc ≈ 0.238), then, from the point of view of an observer who persists in treating DM
as collisionless, there exists a transition value, ˜ztr, of the cosmological redshift, below which, such a
cosmological model is accelerating.

wΩM > wcΩM =

1
14 ≈ 0.0714

In view of all the above, if the universal gravitational ﬁeld is driven by an isothermal DM ﬂuid with
thermodynamical content, then, what is inferred as acceleration of the cosmic expansion could be only
apparent, based on the misinterpretation of several cosmological parameters, by those observers who
(although living in the iDMF model) simply insist on treating DM as dust.

The combination of Equations (32) and (48) results in a non-linear algebraic equation, which involves

the transition value, ztr, of the truly measured cosmological redshift, z, that is,

(50)
Admitting that ztr = 0.752 ± 0.046 [30], Equation (50) can be solved numerically with respect to the

combination wΩM , yielding

In view of Equation (51), w ≥ 1

(51)
(wΩM )tr = 0.1062 ± 0.0028 .
3, i.e., compatibility of the iDMF approach with the observational
data currently available, suggests that the DM consists of relativistic particles. For the time being, a pure
HDM model can not reproduce the large-scale structure of the Universe [168], although there are several
scientists disagreeing with such a premise [182,183]. We should also mention that, the alternative DE
model so considered, reproduces to high accuracy (e.g., much more accurately than the ΛCDM model
itself) the observational results concerning the statistically-independent distance constraint associated
with BAOs data [101] (for a detailed analysis, see [159]).

The idea that the DE could be represented by the energy of the internal motions of an isothermal DM
ﬂuid is quite challenging and should be further examined in the search for alternatives to the DE concept.
In this framework, and in an effort to confront with the HDM issue, in the next Section, we consider a
cosmological model with matter content also in the form of a thermodynamically-involved DM ﬂuid, the
volume elements of which, this time, perform polytropic ﬂows (pDMF model) [160].

4. Polytropic Processes in a Cosmological DM Fluid

In realistic astrophysics, polytropic processes are much more physically relevant than isothermal ﬂows
(see, e.g., [184] (pp. 64–69)). On galactic scale, polytropic processes have been proved very useful in
modeling dark galactic haloes, leading to a signiﬁcant improvement of the galaxies velocity dispersion
proﬁles [161–167]. In the cosmological framework, polytropic (DM) models were ﬁrst encountered as
natural candidates for Cardassian cosmology (see, e.g., [59–61]). They have been used also in the uniﬁed
DE models, to describe a potential interaction between DM and DE (see, e.g., [185–195]).

The polytropic process is a general way of treating ﬂow motions, including many thermodynamic
processes in a single formula. It is a reversible process, such that, the speciﬁc heat of a thermodynamical
system,

dQ
dT

,

C =

(52)

Entropy 2016, 18

14

varies in a prescribed manner (see, e.g., [196] (p. 2)).
In the special case where C = constant,
the thermodynamical system is left with only one independent state variable, the rest-mass density
(barotropic ﬂow). Accordingly, the fundamental equation of state,

is decomposed to

and

p ∝ ρT ,

ρ0(cid:19)Γ
p = p0(cid:18) ρ
T = T0(cid:18) ρ
ρ0(cid:19)Γ−1

(see, e.g., [196] (p. 9), [197] (p. 85)), where p0 and T0 denote the present-time values of pressure and
temperature, respectively, and Γ is the polytropic exponent, deﬁned as

Γ = CP − C
CV − C

(56)

(see, e.g., [196] (p. 5), [198] (p. 86)), where CP (CV ) is the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure (volume).
At this point, we need to stress that, for the deﬁnition of speciﬁc heats, the concept of equilibrium is
essential. However, in an expanding Universe such a concept cannot be posed in an unambiguous way;
hence, in a cosmological setup, the deﬁnition of speciﬁc heats may not coincide with the corresponding
thermodynamic one (in connection, see [198–201]).

In the pDMF model, the ﬁrst law of Thermodynamics yields

(65)

For Γ < 1, Equation (65) suggests that, the pressure of a polytropic-DM perfect ﬂuid is negative. In
this case, the quantity ε + 3p may also become negative, leading to ¨S > 0 (see, e.g., [202]). In other
words, the pDMF model with Γ < 1 may accelerate its expansion.

Upon consideration of Equation (65), Equation (64) is written in the form

H0(cid:19)2
(cid:18) H

(67)

As a consequence, in the pDMF model, the present-time value of the total energy density parameter

equals to unity, i.e.,

Ω0 =

ε0
εc

=

ρcc2
ρcc2 [ΩM + (1 − ΩM )] = 1 .

(68)

In view of Equations (65) and (68), the pDMF Universe with Γ < 1 might be an elegant solution to
the DE problem, by addressing both spatial ﬂatness and the accelerated expansion in a unique theoretical
framework. For this reason, in what follows, we shall scrutinize the pDMF model with Γ < 1.

By virtue of Equation (67), the rest-mass energy density, εmat = ρc2, and the internal (dark) energy

density, εint = ε − εmat, of the Universe matter-energy content satisfy the relation

16

On the other hand, for ΩM = 0.274 [40], Equation (65) suggests that, today, p0 = −2.650(1 − Γ)ρ0c2.
This result might lead to the assumption that the pDMF model is, in fact, a phantom Universe, where
p0 < −ε0. Today, several observational data indicate that the basic cosmic ingredient might (very well)
consist of phantom DE (see, e.g., [41,203]). However, the latest Planck results suggest that, this is
probably due to a geometric degeneracy, which will be erased as more data are added [204]. In view of
such a perspective, we note that, in the pDMF model, the total energy density at the present epoch is not
given by ρ0c2, but by ε0 = Ω−1

M ρ0c2 (cf. Equation (67)). Accordingly, Equation (65) results in

from which, we deduce that p0 > −ε0, as long as
ΩM

p0 = −(1 − Γ)(1 − ΩM )ε0 ,

Γ > −

1 − ΩM ∼= −0.377 .

(71)

(72)

Clearly, the pDMF model with −0.377 < Γ < 1 does not fall into the realm of phantom cosmology.

For 1 − ΩM = ΩΛ, Equation (77) represents the scale factor of the ΛCDM model (cf. Equation (5) of

approach. In units of tEdS, it is given by

to the corresponding nine-year WMAP result [41] and lies well-within range of its (latest) Planck
counterpart [204], concerning the age of the ΛCDM Universe. Clearly, the pDMF model does not suffer
from the (so-called) age problem.

Eventually, from the combination of Equations (74) and (78), we ﬁnd that, the scale factor of the

pDMF model is given by

the time behaviour of which, for several values of Γ < 1, is presented in Figure 3. We note that, there is
always a value of t < t0, above which, the function S(t) becomes concave, i.e., ¨S > 0. This is a very
important result, suggesting that, the pDMF model with Γ < 1 accelerates its expansion. This can be
readily conﬁrmed, upon the calculation of the deceleration parameter associated to this model.

4.2. Confronting with the Coincidence Problem

In the pDMF model with Γ < 1, the Hubble parameter Equation (66), in terms of the cosmological

redshift, is written in the form

H = H0(1 + z)

3

2(cid:20)ΩM +

(1 + z)3(1−Γ)(cid:21)1/2
1 − ΩM

Accordingly, the corresponding deceleration parameter Equation (24), yields

q(z) =

1

2(cid:20)1 −

3(1 − Γ)(1 − ΩM )

ΩM (1 + z)3(1−Γ) + (1 − ΩM )(cid:21) .

(81)

(82)

For z ≫ 1 (i.e., in the distant past), q → 1

2 and the Universe behaves as the EdS model, i.e., a dust
(in other words, decelerating) FRW model. On the other hand, for z = 0 (i.e., at the present epoch), we
have

q0 =

[1 − 3(1 − Γ)(1 − ΩM )] .

Figure 2. The age of the DM ﬂuid perform polytropic ﬂows (pDMF) model, t0, in units
of tEdS, as a function of the polytropic exponent Γ < 1 (red solid line). For every Γ < 1,
t0 > tEdS, and t0 approaches tEdS only in the isothermal (Γ → 1) limit. The horizontal solid
line denotes the age of the Universe (t0 = 1.483 tEdS) in the isobaric (Γ = 0) ΛCDM limit
of the pDMF model.

The minus sign on the rhs of Equation (82) suggests that there is a transition value of z, namely, ztr,

below which, q(z) becomes negative, i.e., the Universe accelerates its expansion. It is given by

ztr =(cid:20)(2 − 3Γ)

ΩM (cid:21) 1
1 − ΩM

3(1−Γ)

− 1 .

(84)

For Γ = 0, Equation (84) yields ztr = 0.744, which lies well-within range of the corresponding
ΛCDM result, namely, ztr = 0.752 ± 0.041 [30]. In view of Equation (84), the condition ztr ≥ 0
imposes the following constraint on the potential values of Γ,

Γ ≤

1

3(cid:20)2 −

ΩM

1 − ΩM(cid:21) .

(85)

For ΩM = 0.274 [40], Equation (85) yields the upper limit, Γ ≤ 0.540, while the requirement for
a non-phantom Universe, Γ > −0.377, may serve as a lower bound of Γ. The behaviour of ztr, as a
function of Γ ≤ 0.540, is presented in Figure 4.

We see that, polytropic acceleration is deﬁnitely not a coincidence. The pDMF model with −0.377 <
Γ ≤ 0.540, most naturally accelerates its expansion, at cosmological redshifts lower than the transition
value given by Equation (84), without the need for either any exotic DE or the cosmological constant.
The question that arises now is, whether these theoretical results are conﬁrmed also by the observational
data related to the distant SNe Ia standard candles or not.

4.3. Compatibility with the Recent SNe Ia Data

Today, many samples of SNe Ia data are used, to scrutinize the viability of the various DE models (see,
e.g., [181]). The most extended one is the Union 2.1 Compilation [30], which consists of 580 SNe Ia
events (Available at http://www.supernova.lbl.gov/Union). Accordingly, to estimate the compatibilty of
the pDMF model with the observational data associated to the SNe Ia distant indicators, once again, we
overplot the corresponding theoretically-derived distance modulus on the Hubble diagram of the Union
2.1 SN Compilation. In this case, the luminosity distance is given by

(see, e.g., [170] (p. 76)), where H(z) is given by Equation (81). Equation (86) can be solved explicitly
in terms of hypergeometric functions (see, e.g., [205] (pp. 1005–1008)), resulting in

Figure 4. The transition redshift, ztr, in the pDMF model as a function of the polytropic
exponent, Γ (blue solid curve). For Γ < −0.377, the Universe resides to the phantom realm
(red dashed curve).

By virtue of Equation (87), the function µ(z), given by Equation (37), is overplotted on the µ versus z
diagram of the extended Union 2.1 Compilation [30]. The outcome is depicted in Figure 5, for −0.09 <
Γ ≤ 0 (in connection, see Section 4.4). It is evident that, the theoretical curve representing the distance
modulus in the context of the pDMF model, ﬁts the entire dataset quite accurately. In other words, there
is no disagreement between our theoretical prediction and the observed distribution of the distant SNe Ia
events.

4.4. Determining the Value of the Polytropic Exponent

In relativistic hydrodynamics, the isentropic velocity of sound is deﬁned as

c2

∂ε(cid:19)S
s = c2(cid:18)∂p

(88)

(see, e.g., [208] (p. 52)), where(cid:0) ∂p

∂ε(cid:1)S ≤ 1, in order to avoid violation of causality [209]. In view of

Equation (88), the barotropic ﬂow in the pDMF model yields a velocity of sound that is not constant, but
(rather) a function of the cosmological redshift, parametrized by Γ. A velocity of sound that varies in a
prescribed manner, could help us restore the degeneracy between the constituents of the dark sector in
the uniﬁed DE models (see, e.g., [201,210–212]). It may also reveal the functional form of the coupling
parameter in the interactive DE models (see, e.g., [213–215]). In fact, as regards the former class of
models, a constant velocity of sound would require c2
s → 0, in order to match the (baryon) mass power
spectrum to the SDSS DR7 data [158]. Accordingly, we distinguish two cases:

In other words, in the isobaric (Γ = 0) limit, the pDMF model does resemble the ΛCDM model,
in which the cosmological constant does not carry any perturbations. For this reason, the Γ = 0
case is often referred to as the ΛCDM limit of the pDMF model.

In view of Equation (98), in a pDMF model compatible to modern observational cosmology,
the polytropic exponent, if not zero (i.e., the ΛCDM model), is deﬁnitely negative and very
close to zero. Equation (98) is in good agreement to the corresponding result that arises for a
generalized Chaplygin gas, p ∼ −ρ−α, from the combination of X-ray and SNe Ia measurements
with data from Fanaroff-Riley type IIb radio-galaxies, namely, α = −0.09+0.54
−0.33 [217]. In addition,
by virtue of Equation (98),
the present-time value of the deceleration parameter given by
Equation (83) falls into the range −0.686 < q0 ≤ −0.589, which lies at the lower part
of the observationally-determined range of values for q0, based on the SALT2 ﬁtting to the
SNe+BAO/CMB data, i.e., q0 = −0.53+0.17

to the common perception,

from deceleration to acceleration in the pDMF model does not necessarily requires εint > εmat.
In fact, according to Equation (69), the internal (dark) energy density became equal to its rest-mass
counterpart quite later, at z = 0.384 (in a model with Γ = 0), which is remarkably close to the
observationally-determined value z = 0.391± 0.033 [30], associated with the ΛCDM model. According
to Equation (100), for values of the polytropic exponent in the range given by Equation (98), the
transition from deceleration to acceleration took place when

The question is, why does it happen in this way. The answer is both revealing and simple: Because

In the context of GR, the dynamics of a spatially-ﬂat FRW model is most appropriately determined

by Equations (7) and (10). In terms of cosmic time, the combination of these two equations yields

In terms of the pDMF approach (cf. Equations (54) and (63)), the condition Equation (103) is written

in complete agreement to the transition redshift, given by Equation (84). In view of Equations (104) and
(105), the pDMF model could most deﬁnitely explain why the Universe transits to acceleration at ztr,
without the need for an extra (dark) energy component or the cosmological constant. Instead, it would
reveal a (conventional) form of DE that so far has been disregarded, i.e., due to the (polytropic) DM ﬂuid
internal motions. It is worth mentioning that the ΛCDM limit (Γ = 0) of the pDMF model reproduces
to high accuracy (also) the value of the (so-called) shift parameter [219], obtained by ﬁtting the CMB
data to the standard ΛCDM model [220] (for a detailed analysis, see [160]).

5. Discussion and Conclusions

24

In this article, we review a series of recent theoretical results regarding a conventional approach
to the DE concept. In particular, we have explored the possibility that, the DE needed to ﬂatten the
Universe and to accelerate its expansion, is attributed to the energy of the cosmic ﬂuid internal motions.
In this framework, the Universe is ﬁlled with a perfect ﬂuid, consisting mainly of self-interacting dark
matter, the volume elements of which perform hydrodynamic ﬂows. The pressure of this ﬂuid is given
by a barotropic equation of state, the functional form of which depends on the type of thermodynamic
processes occuring in its interior. Accordingly, we have distinguished two cases [159,160].

In the ﬁrst case [159], we have considered that the volume elements of the cosmic (DM) ﬂuid
perform isothermal ﬂows (iDMF model). This assumption led us to an alternative approach to the DE
concept. In fact, the internal energy of this ﬂuid can compensate the (extra) DE needed for Ω0 = 1
(cf. Equation (17)), even if the Universe is ever-decelerating (cf. Equation (25)). However, this is not
the case for an observer who insists on treating DM as dust. To ﬁnd out what is inferred by such an
observer, we need to determine several cosmological parameters on which he/she relies, in interpreting
observations. This can be done most appropriately by means of the conformal equivalence technique (cf.
Equations (27) and (28)), developed by Kleidis and Spyrou [175]. The outcome is quite revealing.

In the iDMF model, there is a characteristic value of the actually-measured cosmological redshift, zc
(cf. Equation (36)), above which, dL > ˜dL. In other words, an observer who—although living in the
iDMF model—treats DM as dust, infers that any SN Ia event located at z > zc lies farther (in other
words, it looks fainter) than what is theoretically predicted (cf. Equation (35)). Furthermore, after the
thermodynamical content of the iDMF model is taken into account, the theoretically-derived distance
modulus, µ(z) (given by the combination of Equations (35), (37) and (41)), ﬁts the Hubble diagram of
an extended sample of SNe Ia events [181] quite accurately (green curve in Figure 1), in contrast to the
corresponding collisionless-DM quantity, ˜µ(˜z) (dashed curve in Figure 1). In other words, in the iDMF
model, no disagreement exists between observations and the theoretical prediction for the distant SNe Ia
distribution. Finally, in the context of the iDMF approach, the observers who mistreat DM as dust, also
infer that, recently (cf. Equation (48)), the Universe accelerated its expansion (cf. Equation (47)).

In view of all the above, the iDMF model could (most appropriately) serve as an alternative to the
DE concept. Nevertheless, compatibility of this model with the observational data currently available,
suggests that the DM consists of relativistic particles (cf. Equation (51)). In an effort to confront with
the HDM issue, we have accordingly considered the (astrophysically) more relevant possibility that the
volume elements of the DM ﬂuid perform polytropic ﬂows (pDMF model).

The pDMF model is, simply, a conventional DE model [160]. In the distant past, it behaves as a
dust FRW model (cf. Equation (82), for z ≫ 1), while, on the approach to the present epoch, the
internal physical characteristics of the cosmic ﬂuid take over. In fact, at cosmological redshifts lower than
z = 0.384, the energy density of the internal motions in the pDMF model dominates over its rest-mass
counterpart (cf. Equation (69)). Once again, the internal energy compensates for the extra energy needed
to compromise Ω0 = 1 (cf. Equation (68)). In addition, for values of the polytropic exponent, Γ, lower
than unity, the pressure of the DM ﬂuid is negative (cf. Equation (65)) and, so, the Universe accelerates

Entropy 2016, 18

25

its expansion at cosmological redshifts lower than a transition value (cf. Equation (84)), in a way also
consistent with the condition ε + 3p < 0 (cf. Equations (104) and (105)).

Several physical requirements impose successive constraints on the value of the polytropic exponent.
More speciﬁcally, the second law of Thermodynamics in an expanding Universe suggests that Γ ≤ γ,
where γ is the adiabatic index (in connection, see [160]).
In this context, for Γ < 1, the pressure
becomes negative (cf. Equation (65)). Furthermore, the condition for a non-negative transition redshift
leads to Γ ≤ 0.540 (cf. Equation (85)), while, the requirement for a non-phantom Universe yields
Γ > −0.377 (cf. Equation (72)). A positive velocity-of-sound square at all z, implies Γ ≤ 0 (cf.
Equation (93)), and, eventually, the requirement for CDM at the present epoch results in Γ > −0.09 (cf.
Equation (97)). Hence, in a pDMF model that is compatible with modern observational cosmology, the
polytropic exponent settles down to the range −0.09 < Γ ≤ 0, namely, if it is not zero, it is deﬁnitely
negative, and very close to zero.

In the pDMF approach, the theoretically-determined value of the deceleration parameter at the
present epoch (Equation (83)), has a well-shaped cross-section with the lower part of the corresponding
observationally-determined range, q0 = −0.53+0.17
−0.13 [218]. On the other hand, for Γ = 0, the internal
energy density becomes equal to its rest-mass counterpart at z = 0.384 (cf. Equation (69)), a theoretical
prediction that lies well-within the corresponding ΛCDM range, z = 0.391 ± 0.033 [30]. The pDMF
approach can confront with every major cosmological issue, such as the age problem (see, e.g., Figure
2) and the coincidence problem (cf. Equations (69) and (70), as well as Equations (104) and (105)).
What is most important, is that, in such a model, there is no disagreement between observations and the
theoretical prediction of the distant SNe Ia distribution (see, e.g., Figure 5). Finally, along the lines of the
pDMF framework, we can most naturally interpret why the Universe accelerates its expansion z < ztr
(cf. Equations (104) and (105)).

In view of all the above, we conclude that, the cosmological model with matter content in the form
of a self-interacting DM ﬂuid performing either polytropic or isothermal ﬂows, may serve either for a
conventional DE model or a for viable alternative one, respectively. In fact, the idea that DE is nothing
else but the shadowy reﬂection of DM, looks very promising and should be further inspected, in the
search for a realistic approach to the DE concept.
