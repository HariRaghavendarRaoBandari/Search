EMBEDDINGS OF SPHERICAL HOMOGENEOUS SPACES IN

CHARACTERISTIC p

RUDOLF TANGE

Summary. Let G be a reductive group over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of
characteristic p > 0. We study properties of embeddings of spherical ho-
mogeneous G-spaces. We look at Frobenius splittings, canonical or by a
(p − 1)-th power, compatible with certain subvarieties. We also look at co-
homology vanishing and show the existence of rational G-equivariant resolu-
tions by toroidal embeddings. We show that the class of homogeneous spaces
for which our results hold contains the symmetric homogeneous spaces in
characteristic 6= 2 and is closed under parabolic induction.

Introduction

Let k is an algebraically closed ﬁeld of prime characteristic p and let G be
a connected reductive group. Let H be a closed subgroup scheme of G such
that G/H (see [8, III.3.5.4]) is spherical. We are interested in properties of
embeddings (always normal and equivariant) of G/H: existence of equivariant
“rational” resolutions by toroidal embeddings, (canonical) Frobenius splittings,
compatible splittings, cohomology vanishing. The idea is to show that there is
a class of spherical homogeneous spaces whose embeddings have nice proper-
ties, which contains symmetric homogeneous spaces in characteristic 6= 2 and
the reductive group embeddings in any characteristic, and is closed under par-
abolic induction. Previously special cases were studied in [18] (the wonderful
compactiﬁcation of an adjoint group), [7] (the wonderful compactiﬁcation of an
“adjoint” symmetric homogeneous space), [17] (arbitrary embeddings of reduc-
tive groups), [21] (embeddings of homogeneous spaces induced from reductive
groups).

We describe some of the issues that arise in this general approach. Let
x ∈ G/H be the image of e under the canonical map G → G/H, let B be a
Borel subgroup of G such that B · x is open in G/H and let T be a maximal
torus of B. In [21] it was shown that, after reducing to the toroidal case, one
has a B-canonical splitting by a (p − 1)-th power which compatibly split the
B-stable prime divisors, and this implies certain cohomology vanishing results.
In more general situations, e.g. symmetric homogeneous spaces, this need no
longer be true. Firstly, one cannot construct a B-canonical splitting for the
wonderful compactiﬁcation which is a (p − 1)-th power, since the closed orbit is
G/P for some P which is not a Borel subgroup, and therefore its B-canonical

splitting in general not a (p − 1)-th power. Since it seems necessary to have
a splitting by a (p − 1)-st power to get cohomology vanishing results using
the Mehta-Van der Kallen theorem [5, Thm. 1.2.12, 1.3.14], and B-canonical
splitting are of interest for results about good ﬁltrations we use both types of
splittings. Furthermore, one cannot expect a splitting which compatibly splits
all B-stable prime divisors, since their scheme-theoretic intersections need not
be reduced, see [3, p266]. Finally, one cannot expect the “usual” cohomology
vanishing results for arbitrary spherical varieties in characteristic p, see [11,
Example 3] for an example of an ample line bundle with nonzero H 1. So we
need to make some assumptions on the homogeneous space.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 1 we introduce the notation,
state the basic assumptions (A1)-(A4), and prove some technical lemmas. In
Section 2 we prove our three main results, each result requires one of two
extra assumptions. As it turns out, the second assumption implies the ﬁrst,
see Remark 2.1.2.
In Proposition 2.1 we show that, under a certain extra
assumption, every smooth toroidal embedding is split by a (p − 1)-th power
which compatibly splits the G-stable closed subvarieties. We also give some
non-obvious consequences for cohomology vanishing. Theorem 2.1 states that,
under the same assumption as Proposition 2.1, every G/H-embedding has an
equivariant rational resolution by a toroidal embedding. This then leads to
results about Frobenius splitting and cohomology vanishing. The proofs of
Proposition 2.1 and Theorem 2.1 use ideas from [18], [17], [5] together with the
fact that G/P is split by a (p − 1)-st power, Lemma 1.1, and the fact that we
have a certain expression for the canonical divisor which contains every B-stable
prime divisor with strictly negative coeﬃcient, Lemma 1.3. Theorem 2.2 states
that, under a certain extra assumption, every G/H-embedding is B-canonically
split compatible with all G-stable subvarieties. In Section 4 we show that the
class of homogeneous spaces which satisfy (A1)-(A4) and the second assumption
from Section 2 contains the symmetric spaces. In Section 4 we show that this
class is stable under parabolic induction.

1. Preliminaries

We retain the notation k, p, G, H, x, B, T from the introduction. Recall
that the canonical morphism G/H(k) → G/H is a homeomorphism, see [8, III
§3] or [12, I.5.6]. For a parabolic subgroup P and a ﬁxed maximal torus T of P
we denote by ρP the half sum of the roots of T in the unipotent radical RuP .
The lemma below will be needed in the proof of Proposition 2.1. For the basics
of Frobenius splitting we refer to [5].

Lemma 1.1. Let P be a parabolic subgroup of G. Then G/P is split by a
(p − 1)-th power.

Proof. It is well known and easy to see that ρP is dominant, see e.g. [5, Sect 3.1]
(ρP is there denoted δP ). So by [5, Thm 3.1.2(c)] the multiplication map
H 0(G/P, L(2ρP ))⊗(p−1) → H 0(G/P, L(2(p−1)ρP )) is surjective. Now L(−2ρP )
is the canonical bundle of G/P , so the assertion follows from [5, Ex. 1.3.E(2)].

We recall some facts from the theory of spherical embeddings. For more detail
we refer to [4], [14], and [22]. A G/H-embedding is toroidal if its coloured fan
has no colours, that is, if no B-stable prime divisor which intersects G/H (i.e.
which is not G-stable) contains a G-orbit. For a toroidal G/H-embedding X we
denote by X0 the complement in X of the union of the B-stable prime divisors
that intersect G/H. We denote the closure of T · x in X0 by T · x
. We will say
that the local structure theorem holds for X (relative to x, T and B) if

0

there exists a parabolic subgroup P of G containing B such that, with M the
Levi subgroup of P containing T , the variety T · x
is M -stable, the derived
group DM acts trivially on it, and the action of G induces an isomorphism
Ru(P ) × T · x

→ X0.

The local structure theorem for X implies the local structure theorem for
G/H itself. Furthermore, the parabolic subgroup P only depends on G/H: it
can be characterised as the stabiliser of the open B-orbit B ·x or as the stabiliser
of BH(k) (for the action by left multiplication).

A wonderful compactiﬁcation of G/H is a smooth simple complete toroidal
G/H-embedding. Recall that “simple” means that there is a unique closed
G-orbit.

We will also need the following property of a smooth G/H-embedding X:

The canonical bundle ωX has a nonzero B-semi-invariant rational section of
weight −2ρP with divisor

− X
D

aDD − X
i

Xi ,

(∗)

where the ﬁrst sum is over the B-stable prime divisors of X that are not G-
stable with the aD strictly positive and the second sum is over the boundary
divisors of X.

If X is a toroidal smooth G/H-embedding which satisﬁes the local structure
theorem, then it is easy to see that ωX has a nonzero B-semi-invariant rational
section of weight −2ρP , unique up to scalar multiples, and that its divisor is
given by the formula above with the aD integers. So the crucial point of (*) is
that the coeﬃcients aD are strictly positive.

Lemma 1.2 (cf.[2, Prop. 4.1]). Let X be a smooth G/H-embedding. Assume the
local structure theorem holds for the toroidal embedding obtained by removing
all orbits of codimension > 1 from X, and assume the T -orbit map of x is
separable, then X has property (*).

Proof. Since the proof in [2] is very brief we give a bit more detail. We reduce as
in [loc. cit.] to the case that X is smooth and toroidal by removing the orbits of
0 ∼
→
codimension > 1. Then we have the local structure theorem Ru(P ) × T · x
X0. If an algebraic group K acts on X by automorphisms, then Lie(K) acts
on OX by derivations, put diﬀerently, we have a Lie algebra homomorphism
ϕ : Lie(K) → Vect(X). Furthermore, ϕ(u)y ∈ Ty(K · y) (†) for all u ∈ Lie(K)
and y ∈ X. We have dim(Ty(B · y)) = dim(B · y) < dim(B · x) = dim(RuP ) +
dim(T · x) for all y ∈ X \ B · x. Let θ be the wedge product of the ϕ-images of

4

R. H. TANGE

a basis of Lie(RuP ) together with a lift to Lie(T ) of a basis of Lie(T · x). Here
the lift of the basis of Lie(T · x) to elements in Lie(T ) exists by the separability
assumption. Clearly θ has weight 2ρP . By (†) applied to K = B we have that
θ vanishes on the complement of the open B-orbit B · x = RuP T · x, i.e. on the
union of B-stable prime divisors. Furthermore, it is well known that it vanishes
to the order one on the boundary divisors and it is easy to see that it is nonzero
on RuP T · x. So θ is a global section of the anti-canonical bundle with divisor
of zeros PD aDD + Pi Xi, aD > 0.
(cid:3)

For any smooth G/H-embedding X with boundary divisors Xi we put ˜ωX =
ωX ⊗ OX (Pi Xi). Note that if X has property (*), then we have ˜ωX =
OX (− PD aDD).

Let Ha be a closed subgroup scheme of G containing H and let xa ∈ G/Ha
be the image of e under the canonical map G → G/Ha. From the next section
on we will make the following assumptions

(A1) Ha is generated by H and a closed subgroup scheme of T that normalises

H;

(A2) the homogeneous space G/Ha has a wonderful compactiﬁcation X for

which the local structure theorem (see Section 1) holds;

(A3) The wonderful compactiﬁcation X of G/Ha has property (*) above.
(A4) The characters through which H acts on the top exterior powers of Tx(G/H)

and Txa(G/Ha) are the same.

By [21, Prop. 3.2(i)] (see also [5, Prop. 6.2.3(i)]), (A1) and (A2) imply that
the local structure theorem holds for all toroidal G/H-embeddings. Note that if
f : G → G′ is a central (cf. [1, V.2.2]) surjective morphism of reductive groups,
a closed subgroup schemes of G′ and H, Ha the scheme theoretic inverse
H ′ ⊆ H ′
image of H ′, H ′
a do
(relative to B′ = f (B), T ′ = f (T ) etc.). Note also that the closed orbit of X is
G/P −, where P − is the opposite parabolic of P relative to T . We denote the
boundary divisors of X by X1, . . . , Xr.

a under f , then G, H, Ha satisfy (A1)-(A4),

if G′, H ′, H ′

Lemma 1.3. Assume (A1)-(A4). Let X be a smooth toroidal G/H-embedding
and let Y be a smooth toroidal G/Ha embedding and assume the canonical map
G/H → G/Ha extends to a morphism X → Y . Then ˜ωX is G-equivariantly
isomorphic to the pull-back of ˜ωY . In particular, all smooth G/H-embeddings
have property (*).

Proof. Let s1 and s2 be the (unique up to scalar multiples) nonzero B-semi-
invariant rational section of ˜ωX resp. ˜ωY of weight −2ρP . They are the nonzero
B-semi-invariant rational sections of ωX and ωY multiplied with canonical sec-
tions of the boundary divisors of X resp. Y . Let s′
2 be the pull-back of s2 to
the pull-back bundle of ˜ωY to X. First we show that the divisor (s1) equals
(s′
2). From the local structure theorems for X and Y it is clear that (s1) and
(s′
2) do not involve the boundary divisors of X, so it is enough to show that
(s1) and (s′
2) are equal on G/H. Since the equivariant Picard group PicG(G)
is trivial s1 and s′
2 pull back to (B × H)-semi-invariant functions on G. Since
they have the same B-weight −2ρP it is enough to show they have the same
H-weight and this follows from (A4).

Since (s1) equals (s′

of ˜ωY such that s1 corresponds to s′
bundle on X diﬀer by a character of G and s1 and s′
is clear that this isomorphism is G-equivariant.

2), there is an isomorphism between ˜ωX and the pull-back
2. Since any two G-linearisations of a line
2 have the same weight it
(cid:3)

Note that if we deﬁne a canonical divisor of a G/H-embedding X to be a
divisor whose restriction to the smooth locus X ′ of X is a canonical divisor of
X ′, then, assuming (A1)-(A4), a canonical divisor of any G/H-embedding X is
given by the formula in (*).

Remarks 1.1. 1. Of the assumptions (A1)-(A4, (A2) is the most important
one; it is for example not satisﬁed by the varieties of unseparated ﬂags from
[11]. It is essential that in the local structure theorem the isomorphism is given
by the action of G. If H and Ha are reduced we can deduce (A4) as follows.
We have Tx(G/H) = Lie(G)/Lie(H) and Txa(G/H) = Lie(G)/Lie(Ha) and we
obtain an exact sequence

0 → Lie(Ha/H) → Tx(G/H) → Txa(G/Ha) → 0 .

So the top exterior power of Tx(G/H) is the tensor product of the top exterior
powers of Txa(G/Ha) and Lie(Ha/H). Now (A4) follows from the fact that the
action of H on Lie(Ha/H) is trivial. I do not know of any examples where (A1)
and (A2) are satisﬁed, but not (A3) or (A4).
2. In [2] the coeﬃcients aD from (*) are determined and, at least in many
special cases, this can also be done in prime characteristic. For example, when
G/H is a symmetric space G/Gθ, G adjoint semisimple, then this amounts to
writing the canonical divisor plus the sum of the boundary divisors as a linear
combination of the images in Pic(X) of the B-stable prime divisors of X that
are not G-stable, where X is the wonderful compactiﬁcation of G/H (these
form basis of Pic(X)). Since Pic(X) embeds naturally in Pic(G/P −), G/P −
the closed orbit, via restriction (see [7]), and the line bundle corresponding to
the above divisor restricts to the canonical bundle of Pic(G/P −) this amounts
to writing −2ρP as a linear combination of the above images. In the notation
of [22, Prop 26.22] these images are: the ˆ̟i, i a ι-ﬁxed node of the Satake
diagram, and the ̟k + ̟ι(k), k a ι-unstable node of the Satake diagram, except
that we split the weights in the second list that correspond to the exceptional
simple roots (see [7, Sect. 4]) into their two summands.

2. Frobenius splittings and rational resolutions

We retain the notation from the previous sections and we assume that prop-

erty (A1)-(A4) hold.

Proposition 2.1. Assume the restriction map H 0(X, ˜ω−1
is surjective and let X be a smooth toroidal G/H-embedding. Then

X ) → H 0(G/P −, ω−1

G/P −)

(i) X is Frobenius split by a (p − 1)-th power which compatibly splits all G-

stable subvarieties.

(ii) Assume X is proper over an aﬃne, let L be a semi-ample line bundle on

X and let Y be a closed G-stable subvariety of X.
(a) If X is quasiprojective, then H i(Y, L) = 0 for all i ≥ 1.

(b) If X is simple, then the restriction map H 0(X, L) → H 0(Y, L) is

surjective.

X ). Then τ p−1 ∈ H 0(X, ω1−p

Proof. (i). Since the local structure theorem holds for X, it has a toroidal
smooth completion, see [22, Sect. 29.2]. So we may assume X complete as
well. There is a unique G-equivariant morphism ϕ : X → X which maps x
to xa. By the local structure theorem its restriction to any closed orbit is an
isomorphism. By Lemma 1.1 there exists s ∈ H 0(G/P −, ω−1
G/P −) with sp−1 a
splitting of G/P −. By assumption we can ﬁnd a lift s ∈ H 0(X, ˜ω−1
X ) of s. Note
that by Lemma 1.3 we have ϕ∗(˜ωX) = ˜ωX. Let σi be the canonical section of
OX (Xi) and put τ = ϕ∗(s) Qi σi ∈ H 0(X, ω−1
X ) is a
splitting of X which compatibly splits the boundary divisors Xi and therefore
all G-stable closed subvarieties. This follows from by considering its restriction
to a closed orbit, where it is a splitting. See [17, Thm. 2], [18, Thm. 3.1] or [5,
Thm. 6.1.12, Ex. 1.3.E.4] for more details.
(ii)(a). Let s, the σi and τ be as in (i) (restricted to the original X) and put E =
(ϕ∗(s)), the divisor of ϕ∗(s). By [5, Prop. 1.3.11] E is reduced and eﬀective and
contains none of the Xi, and the splitting given by τ is compatible with (τ ) =
E +Pi Xi. By [5, Lem. 1.4.11] there is for all j ≥ 0, 0 ≤ nj, m < pr and i ≥ 0 a
split injection H i(X, L) → H i(X, Lpr
(Pj njXj + mE)) (*). Now E is linearly
equivalent to the divisor PD aDD, the aD as in (*), see Lemma 1.3. Since X
is quasiprojective it has a B-stable ample eﬀective divisor E′ (cf. proof of [4,
Cor. 6.2.8]). We can write E′ = Pj n′
j and
m such that maD ≥ bD for all D, then Pj njXj + mE ∼ Pj n′
jXj +PD maDD
will be ample, since each OX (D) is generated by its global sections. The latter
follows from the fact that no D contains a G-orbit, since X is toroidal. See
the argument in the proof of [4, Prop. 2.2]. Finally, we choose r such that
nj, m < pr. Now the assertion for Y = X follows from (*) and [5, Thm. 1.2.8].
The case of arbitrary Y follows by observing that τ restricts to a splitting of Y
and that Y is a smooth toroidal spherical variety which is proper over an aﬃne
and quasiprojective. Furthermore, the local structure theorem clearly holds for
Y . So we can apply the same arguments as above.
(b). The splitting given by τ p−1 is compatible with E ∼ PD aDD which is
ample since X is simple, see [22, Cor. 17.20]. So τ p−1 is an (p−1)E-splitting and
therefore also an E-splitting by [5, Thm. 1.4.10, Rem. 1.4.2(ii)]. Furthermore,
E contains no G-orbit, since ϕ∗(s) is nonzero on the closed orbit. So all closed
G-stable subvarieties are compatibly E-split and the result follows from [5,
Thm. 1.4.8(ii)].

Theorem 2.1. Assume the restriction map H 0(X, ˜ω−1

(i) X has a G-equivariant rational resolution by a quasiprojective toroidal

G/H-embedding.

(ii) X is Frobenius split compatible with all G-stable subvarieties.
(iii) If X is proper over an aﬃne and quasiprojective and L is a semi-ample

line bundle on X, then H i(X, L) = 0 for all i ≥ 1.

Proof. (i). Let ϕ : ˜X → X be a resolution with ϕ projective and ˜X smooth,
quasiprojective and toroidal, constructed as in [5, Sect. 6.2A] (cf. also [17] and
[10]). We have to show that ϕ is rational. The arguments are very similar to
the proof of [5, Cor. 6.2.8]. Only for the vanishing of the higher direct images of
O ˜X we have to use Proposition2.1(ii)(a) rather than the arguments in [loc. cit.].
Since ϕ is proper and birational and X is normal, we have ϕ∗(O ˜X ) = OX . Let
τ p−1 be the Frobenius splitting given by Proposition 2.1(i). Then τ vanishes on
the exceptional locus of ϕ, since the latter is contained in the complement of the
open G-orbit, i.e. the union of the boundary divisors. So, by [5, Thm. 1.3.14]
we have Riϕ∗(ω ˜X) = 0 for all i ≥ 1. It remains to show that Riϕ∗(O ˜X ) = 0 for
all i ≥ 1. Since the assertion is local on X we may, by Sumihiro’s Theorem ([19],
[20]), assume that X is projective. Note that ˜X is complete (in fact projective,
since ϕ is projective). By Kempf’s Lemma, [13, Lem. 1] or [5, Lem. 3.3.3(a)],
it suﬃces to show that there exists an ample line bundle L on X such that
H i( ˜X, ϕ∗(L)) = 0 for all i ≥ 1. Note that ϕ∗(L) is semi-ample or generated by
global sections if L is, so by Proposition 2.1(ii)(a) any ample line bundle L on
X will do, and there exists one, since X is projective.
(ii). We take a resolution ϕ : ˜X → X as in (ii). Then, by [5, Lem. 1.1.8], we can
push a splitting of ˜X as in Proposition 2.1(i) forward to X, since ϕ∗(O ˜X ) = OX .
It will compatibly split all G-stable closed subvarieties, since this holds for the
splitting of ˜X.
(iii). Again we take a resolution ϕ : ˜X → X as in (ii). Note that ˜X is proper
→ H i( ˜X, ϕ∗(L)) for all i ≥ 0, see
over an aﬃne, since X is. We have H i(X, L)
e.g. [5, Lemma 3.3.2]. Now ϕ∗(L) is semi-ample since L is, so the result follows
from Proposition 2.1(ii)(a).
(cid:3)
Theorem 2.2. Assume the restriction map H 0(X, ˜ω1−p
G/P −)
is surjective and that its kernel has a good ﬁltration. Let X be a G/H-embedding.
Then X has a B-canonical Frobenius splitting which compatibly splits all G-
stable subvarieties.

X ) → H 0(G/P −, ω1−p

∼

Proof. After replacing G by the connected centre times the simply connected
cover of the derived group DG, we may assume that ρ ∈ X(T ). We take
a resolution ϕ : ˜X → X as in Proposition 2.1(ii). Recall that the (ﬁrst)
Steinberg module St is irreducible and also isomorphic to the induced mod-
ule ∇((p − 1)ρ) and to the Weyl module ∆((p − 1)ρ), see [12, II.3.18,19].
Let v− and v+ be a (nonzero) lowest and highest weight vector of St. By
[5, Lem. 4.1.6] σ ∈ H 0( ˜X, ω1−p
) is B-canonical if an only if it is the image of
v− ⊗ v+ under a G-module homomorphism St ⊗ St → H 0( ˜X, ω1−p
). Let s ∈
H 0(G/P −, ω1−p
G/P −) be the B-canonical splitting of G/P −, see [5, Thm. 4.1.15].
Since St is a Weyl module, St ⊗ St has a Weyl ﬁltration by [5, Cor. 4.2.14].
So HomG(St ⊗ St, −) is exact on short exact sequences of G-modules with
a good ﬁltration. So from the assumption of the Theorem we deduce that
HomG(St⊗St, H 0( ˜X, ˜ω1−p
G/P −)) is surjective.
Now let f ∈ HomG(St⊗St, H 0(G/P −, ω1−p
G/P −)) be such that f (v−⊗v+) = s. We
lift f to f ∈ HomG(St ⊗ St, H 0( ˜X, ˜ω1−p
X )) and we put s = f (v− ⊗ v+). Clearly s

restricts to s. So we can construct a splitting ϕ∗(s) Qi σp−1
X ) of ˜X
which compatibly splits all G-stable subvarieties, similar to Proposition 2.1(i).
Clearly this splitting is B-canonical. Finally we push the splitting down to X
by means of ϕ and apply [5, Lem. 1.1.8, Ex. 4.1.E(3)].

Remarks 2.1. 1. The existence of a B-canonical splitting as in Theorem 2.2
implies existence of good ﬁltrations in several situations, see [5, Thm. 4.2.13,
Ex. 4.2.E(2)]. It also implies normality of the G-orbit closures that are com-
patibly split, see [21, Cor to Prop. 2.1].
2. The assumption of Theorem 2.2 is in fact equivalent to the existence of a
B-canonical splitting of X which compatibly splits the closed orbit G/P −. In-
deed, assuming the latter, we have that H 0(X, ˜ω1−p
G/P −) is
surjective, since ˜ω1−p
X is ample by [22, Cor. 17.20] and G/P − is compatibly
split, see [5, Thm. 1.4.8]. Furthermore, its kernel has a good ﬁltration by [5,
Ex. 4.2.E(2)]. Similarly, we have that the assumption of Proposition 2.1 and
Theorem 2.1 is equivalent the existence of a splitting of X which compatibly
splits G/P −. In particular, this assumption is implied by that of Theorem 2.2.

X ) → H 0(G/P −, ω1−p

3. Symmetric spaces

We notice that the case of group embeddings in any characteristic is already
treated in [17, 21]. In the remainder of this section we assume that char(k) 6= 2.
For background on symmetric spaces we refer to [16, 23, 7, 22]. Let θad 6= id
be an involution of the adjoint group Gad of G, let π : G → Gad the canonical
homomorphism, let Z(G) be the scheme-theoretic centre of G and let Ha =
Z(G)π−1(Gθad
ad ) (see [12, I.6.2] for this notation) be the scheme theoretic scheme-
theoretic inverse image under π of the ﬁxed point subgroup Gθad
ad . Note that
π−1(Gθad
ad ) = {g ∈ G | gθ(g)−1 ∈ Z(G(k))}. Let Tad be a maximal torus of Gad
which contains a maximal θad-split torus and let Pad ⊇ Bad be a parabolic and
Borel subgroup of Gad containing Tad as in e.g. [22, Sect. 26.4] or [7, Sect. 1].
Let T, P, B be the corresponding maximal torus, parabolic and Borel subgroup
of G. Now let H be a closed subgroup scheme of Ha such that (A1) and (A4)
are satisﬁed. Then B · x is open in G/H.

For example, assume H is a closed subgroup scheme of Ha with (Gθ)0 ⊆ H
for an involution θ of G with π ◦ θ = θad ◦ π. Then T contains a maximal θ-split
torus and therefore it is θ-stable. By the arguments from [16, Lem. 8.1] (or [23,
Lemme 2]) Ha(k) is generated by (Gθ)0 and Ha(k) ∩ T . Adding Z(G) ⊆ T to
Ha(k) gives us Ha, so (A1) is satisﬁed in this case. Now assume in addition H
is reduced. We check that (A4) is satisﬁed. Since H = (Gθ)0(H ∩ T ) and, by
property (*), the character of H ∩ T on Tx(G/H) is given by −2ρP it is enough
to look at the H 0-character. The G-action on the top exterior power of Lie(G)
is trivial and the H 0-action on the top exterior power of Lie(H) is trivial, so
the H 0-action on the top exterior power of Lie(G)/Lie(H) is trivial. Similarly,
the (Gθad
ad ) is trivial.
Since H 0 maps to (Gθad

ad )0-action on the top exterior power of Lie(Gad)/Lie(Gθad

ad )0, (A4) follows.

Now we check that the assumptions (A2) and (A3) from Section 3, which
only depend on Ha, are satisﬁed. By [7, Prop. 3.8], the local structure theorem,

EMBEDDINGS OF SPHERICAL HOMOGENEOUS SPACES IN CHARACTERISTIC p

9

with T and P as above, holds for G/Ha = Gad/Gθad
ad , so (A2) is satisﬁed.
Furthermore, the Tad = π(T )-orbit map of x is separable by [7, 1.8, 3.5], so
(A3) is satisﬁed by Lemma 1.2.

Finally, we check the assumptions in the results from Section 2. It follows
from [7, Thm. 5.9] that the assumptions of Proposition 2.1 and Theorem 2.1
are satisﬁed. Indeed ˜ω−1
X is ample by [22, Cor. 17.20], so [7, Thm. 5.9] and [5,
Thm. 1.2.8] imply that the restriction map H 0(X, ˜ω−1
G/P −)
is surjective. Similarly, it is clear from [7, Prop. 5.7, Thm. 5.10] that the
assumptions of Theorem 2.2 are satisﬁed in this situation. Here one has to look
at the construction of the good ﬁltration of [7, Thm. 5.10] to see that it contains
a good ﬁltration for the kernel of the restriction map.

X ) → H 0(G/P −, ω−1

4. Parabolic induction

In this ﬁnal section we show that most of the assumptions that we used are
preserved if we apply parabolic induction to G/H. We retain the notation and
assumptions (A1)-(A4) of Section 1 and 2. Let G be a connected reductive
group and let Q be a parabolic subgroup of G with a surjective homomorphism
π : Q → G. We assume that

(P) the isogeny Q/Ker(π) → G induced by π is central (cf. [1, V.2.2]).

Let T maximal torus of G whose image in G is T , let B be a Borel subgroup
of Q containing T with π(B) = B. Let P ⊆ Q be the inverse image of P under
π and let Q−, P −, B− be the opposites of Q, P, B relative to T .1 Let K be the
Levi subgroup of Q containing T and denote the natural map Q− → K → G
by π−. Note that (P) also holds when we replace Q and π by Q− and π−.
Now let H, Ha ⊆ Q− be the scheme theoretic inverse images under π− of H
and Ha. For closed subgroup schemes G1, G2 of G denote by G1G2 the scheme
theoretic intersection of G1 and G2; similar for closed subgroups schemes of
G. Let K′ be the subgroup of K generated by T and the simple factors of K
that do not lie in the kernel of π. Then the isogeny K′ → G is central and
Q−/H = G/H = K′/HK′.

By [21, Lem. 3.1] G/H is spherical, its open B-orbit is B · x. Moreover, if
Di, i ∈ I are the B-stable prime divisors of G/H, then we have unique B-stable
prime divisors Di = BDi, i ∈ I of G/H which intersect G/H in the Di. The
other B-stable prime divisors of G/H are the pull-backs Dα = Bsα · x to G/H
of the B-stable prime divisors BsαQ−/Q− of G/Q−, α a simple root in RuQ.
We will denote the closures of the B-stable prime divisors of G/H in any G/H-
embedding by the same letters. Recall that the valuation cone of G/H is the
same as that of G/H, see [22, Prop. 14.4] and[21, Prop. 3.1], and it is easy
to determine the images of the Dα in the valuation cone, cf.
[21, Prop. 4.1].
Furthermore, the toroidal embeddings of G/H are obtained by parabolically
inducing the toroidal embeddings of G/H, see [21, Prop. 3.2].

Now we will show that assumptions (A1)-(A4) hold for G, H, B etc.

If
T1 is a closed subgroup scheme of HT which normalises H such that T1 and H
generate Ha, then the scheme theoretic inverse image of T1 under π : HT → HT

1In [21] P, P and Q were denoted by Q, Q and P.

10

normalises H and together with H it generates Ha. Thus (A1) holds for G, H
and Ha.

By (A2) Q−/Ha = G/Ha has a wonderful compactiﬁcation X for which the
local structure theorem holds. So, by [21, Prop. 3.3], G/Ha has the wonderful
compactiﬁcation X = G ×Q−
X for which the local structure theorem (relative
to x, T , B and with P as above) holds. Thus (A2) holds for G/Ha.

Lemma 4.1. Let X be a K-variety and let L be a G-linearised line bundle on
X = G ×Q−
X (RuQ− acting trivially on X). Let ˜s be the B-semi-invariant
lift of a nonzero BK-semi-invariant rational section s of L = L|X of weight λ.
Then ˜s is a global section if and only if s is global and λ is dominant relative to
B. If ˜s is global, then the divisor (˜s) of ˜s contains Dα = Bsα · X with coeﬃcient
hλ, α∨i.

Proof. Since the global sections of L form a rational G-module it is clear that
for ˜s to be global s must be global and λ dominant. Now assume the latter.
Let ∆K(λ) be the K-Weyl module of highest weight λ. By [12, II.2.11, 5.21],
[9, Sect. 1] we can consider ∆K(λ) as the sub K-module of the G-Weyl module
∆(λ) generated by the highest weight vector vλ. In fact it is the sum of the
weight spaces of ∆(λ) corresponding to the weights which are congruent to λ
modulo the root lattice of K. The sum of the other weight spaces is Q−-stable
and the quotient by it is isomorphic to ∆K(λ) with RuQ− acting trivially. Using
the projection ∆(λ) → ∆K(λ) and the universal property of the Weyl module
∆K(λ), we obtain a homomorphism of Q−-modules f : ∆(λ) → H 0(X, L) with
f (vλ) = s. Since L = G ×Q−
H 0(X , L) = indG

Q−H 0(X, L) = MorQ−(G, H 0(X, L)) ,

L we have

Q− acting by right multiplication on G, and Frobenius reciprocity gives us the
homomorphism of G-modules ˜f : v 7→ (g 7→ f (g−1v)) : ∆(λ) → H 0(X , L).
Now we have ˜s = ˜f (vλ) = g 7→ f (g−1vλ). A direct description of ˜s without
the above identiﬁcation is ˜s(g · y) = g · f (g−1vλ)y for all g ∈ G and y ∈ X.
Let α be a simple root in RuQ. The pull-back prime divisor Dα = Bsα · X
intersects the open set sαB · X = VαsαUα · X ∼= Vα × Uα × X, where Vα is
the product of the Uβ with β > 0, 6= α and sα(β) a root of RuQ. Here the
isomorphism is given by the group multiplication and the group action after
choosing a representative nα ∈ NG(T ) of sα.
If we choose an isomorphism
θα : ka → Uα, ka the additive group of k, and denote the corresponding ka-
coordinate by a then Dα ∩ sαB · X is deﬁned by a = 0. Let u ∈ Vα, y ∈ X
and a ∈ k. Then ˜s(unαθ(a) · y) = unαθ(a) · f (θ(−a)n−1
α vλ
is a nonzero weight vector of weight sα(λ) = λ − mα, with m = hλ, α∨i, and
θ(−a)w = Pm
i=0(−a)iXα,iw in the notation of [12, II.1.12]. Furthermore, we
have f (Xα,iw) = 0 for i < m and Xα,mw = cvλ for some c ∈ k \ {0}. So
˜s(unαθ(a) · y) = c(−a)munαθ(a) · sy. Since unαθ(a) · y 7→ unαθ(a) · sy is
nowhere zero on sαB · X it follows that (˜s) contains Bsα · X with coeﬃcient
m.

Corollary 4.1. Assumption (A3) holds for G/Ha.

(ω−1

Proof. We have ωX = ωpr ⊗ pr∗ωG/Q−, where pr : X → G/Q− is the canonical
projection and ωpr is the relative canonical bundle. Now pr∗ωG/Q− = G ×Q−
X = G ×Q−
(X × k−2ρQ ) and ωpr = G ×Q−
ωX, so ω−1
X ⊗ k2ρQ). Let s′
be the global section of weight 2ρP of ω−1
X and let s be s′ considered as a
section of ω−1
X ⊗ k2ρQ . Note that we can consider 2ρP as a character of T
and then it is the sum of the roots in Ru(P ∩ K), so ρP = ρP + ρQ. Since
pr−1(BQ−/Q−) ∼= RuQ × X and since (A3) holds for G/Ha, it is enough to
show that s lifts to a B-semi-invariant global section ˜s of ω−1
X of weight 2ρP
which vanishes along the prime divisors Dα to X of the B-stable prime divisors
BsαQ−/Q− of G/Q−, α a simple root in RuQ. So the result follows from
Lemma 4.1 with λ = 2ρP , noting that hλ, α∨i > 0 for α a simple root in
RuQ ⊆ RuP.
(cid:3)

Clearly (A4) is equivalent to

ωG/H is G-equivariantly isomorphic to the pull-back of ωG/Ha along G/H →
G/Ha.
But, as in the proof of the above Corollary, we have ωG/H = (G ×Q−
ωG/H) ⊗
pr∗ωG/Q− and ωG/Ha = (G ×Q−
aωG/Q−, where pr : G/H → G/Q−
and pra : G/Ha → G/Q− are the canonical projections. From this it follows
that (A4) holds for G, H and Ha.

ωG/Ha) ⊗ pr∗

We now show that the assumption of Theorem 2.2 is preserved under para-

bolic induction.
Proposition 4.1. If the restriction map H 0(X, ˜ω1−p
G/P −)
is surjective and its kernel has a good ﬁltration, then the same holds for the
restriction map H 0(X , ˜ω1−p

X ) → H 0(G/P −, ω1−p

X ) → H 0(G/P −, ω1−p

G/P −).

Proof. By Remark 2.1.2 the assumption is equivalent to the existence of a B-
canonical splitting of X which compatibly splits the closed orbit G/P −. Assume
the latter holds. Then this splitting is also B−-canonical, by [5, Prop. 4.1.10],
and it is clearly also B−-canonically Frobenius split (as a Q−-variety), so, by a
result of Mathieu, see [15, Prop. 5.5] or [5, Thm. 4.1.17, Ex. 4.1.E(4)], G ×B−
X
is B−-canonically and therefore also B-canonically Frobenius split, compatible
with G×B−
X
is a locally trivial ﬁbration with ﬁber Q−/B− we deduce easily that the push-
forward of the structure sheaf of G ×B−
X is that X . Now we push the splitting
down to X = G ×Q−
X and obtain that X is B-canonically Frobenius split
compatible with the closed G-orbit.
(cid:3)

Q−/P −. From the fact that the morphism G×B−

X → X = G×Q−

Remark 4.1. It is not clear to me whether the assumption of Proposition 2.1
and Theorem 2.1 is preserved under parabolic induction, but recall that it is
implied by the assumption of Theorem 2.2.

We end with a description of the Picard group of X in terms of that of X
similar to [21, Prop. 4.2]2 in the case of induction from a reductive group. Since

2 In the proof of [21, Prop. 4.2(i)] the ﬁrst occurrence of (−̟i, ̟i) should be replaced by

̟i1 + ̟i2 and the second occurrence should be omitted.

we are only interested in X and X we may assume that Ha = H and Ha = H,
and since Ha and Ha contain the connected centres of G and G we may assume
that G and G are semisimple and G simply connected. Then Pic(X ) = PicG(X )
and the restriction of π to the derived group DK′ is the simply connected cover
˜G → G of G. It is now easy to see that we obtain a diagram with exact rows
as in [6, p26]

where the ﬁrst vertical arrow is the identity and all other arrows are pull-back
or restriction. Here one uses that Pic(RuQ × X) = Pic(X) and similar for
G/P − = Q−/P −. Furthermore, the second vertical arrow is injective if the
third one is, see [6, Prop. 4.1], [21, Prop. 3.3].

As is well-known, Pic(G/P −) and Pic(G/P −) are isomorphic to the weight
lattices Ω and Λ of G and ˜G. The ﬁrst is freely generated by the fundamental
weights ωβ, β a root of G (or of K′), and ωα, α a simple root in RuQ; the second
is freely generated by the fundamental weights ̟β, β a root of G.

Assume from now on that the third (and second) vertical arrow is injective.3
Then we can describe these arrows as follows: a line bundle L on X is mapped
to the weight of the (unique up to scalar multiples) B-semi-invariant section of
L which is nonzero on G/P −. In the case of the line bundle corresponding to
a B-stable prime divisor this is the weight of the canonical section. Similar for
X.

We describe a right inverse to the third horizontal arrow in the second row
of the above diagram. The natural restriction map Ω → Λ sends ωβ to ̟β and
the ωα to 0. This map has a natural right inverse: for each λ ∈ Λ there is a
unique ˜λ ∈ Ω which restricts to λ and with h˜λ, α∨i = 0, for all simple roots α
in RuQ. Under this map ̟β goes to ωβ.

We now describe the corresponding right inverse to the third horizontal arrow
in the ﬁrst row. Firstly, it is well-known that Pic(X ) is freely generated by the
line bundles corresponding to the B-stable prime divisors that are not G-stable,
and similar for Pic(X). If for the B-stable prime divisor Di, the line bundle
L(Di) on X has image µi in Λ, then the line bundle L(Di) has image ˜µi in
Ω. Indeed, if s is the canonical section of L(Di), then (s) = Di and s|X is the
canonical section of L(Di). So, by Lemma 4.1, s must have weight ˜µi. Thus we
can conclude that L(Di) is mapped to L(Di). We note that, under this right
inverse, the line bundles L(Xj) corresponding to the boundary divisors Xj of X
will in general not be mapped to the line bundles L(Xj) of X . The L(Xj) have
a natural G-linearisation and we have L(Xj) = G ×Q−
L(Xj). So the images of
the L(Xj) in Λ actually lie in the character group of T and the images of the
L(Xj) in Ω are obtained by pulling these back along π : T → T .

3This is the case for symmetric spaces, see [7, Thm. 4.2(ii)].

So in the case X is a symmetric space, one simply obtains Pic(X ) by replac-
ing in the formulas at the end of Remark 1.1.2 the fundamental weights of ˜G
by the corresponding fundamental weights of G and then adding to these the
fundamental weights ωα, α a simple root in RuQ. The images of the L(Xj) in
Ω are obtained by pulling the weights αj − θ(αj) back along π : T → T .
