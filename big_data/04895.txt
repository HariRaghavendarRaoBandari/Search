ABSTRACT

We present optical and ultraviolet spectra of Supernova 1885 (S And), visible in absorption against
the bulge of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), taken with the Hubble Space Telescope STIS Spectrograph
in order to probe the three dimensional arrangement of the supernova debris. Spectra covering 2900 −
5700 ˚A taken using six 0.′′2 wide slit positions in two orientations show broad Ca II H & K absorption
with blue and red radial velocities out to at least 11 500 km s−1, consistent with HST narrow passband
Ca II images of S And. Enhanced Ca II absorption is seen between 2000 and 5000 km s−1 suggestive of
a Ca II-rich inner shell. The spectra also show strong, asymmetric Ca I 4227 ˚A absorption extending
out to +12 400 km s−1, along with weak Fe I 3720 ˚A absorption apparently conﬁned to a shell with
expansion velocities between 2000 and 9000 km s−1 on both the near and far sides of the remnant.
Ultraviolet spectra obtained with a 0.′′5 wide slit at one orientation revealed weak broad absorption
shortward of 3000 ˚A consistent with model predictions. The STIS spectra, together with previous HST
images, show a layered structure with sharp and well deﬁned Ca-rich outer edge indicative of a delayed
detonation phase. The remnant’s clumpy inner Ca-rich shell plus only a handful of Fe-rich plumes is
unlike morphologies expected from dynamical or violent merger scenarios. Instead, a small number
of Fe-rich plumes suggest their formation during a deﬂagration phase by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities
but less well developed without extended mixing as expected from hydrodynamic calculations. The
suppression of strong Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities is possibly the result of strong magnetic ﬁelds. As
a likely scenario, we propose SN 1885 was an oﬀ-center, delayed detonation and slightly subluminous
SN Ia event similar to SN 1986g.

1. INTRODUCTION

explosions of degenerate

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thought to be
the
carbon-oxygen white
dwarfs that undergo a thermonuclear runaway when
they reach the Chandrasekhar limit (Hoyle & Fowler
1960; Colgate & McKee 1969; Nomoto et al. 1984;
Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000; Li et al. 2003). Possible
SN Ia progenitor systems have been discussed recently by
Howell (2011), Nugent et al. (2011), Bloom et al. (2012),
Di Stefano & Kilic (2012), and H¨oﬂich et al. (2013).

Observed SNe Ia spectra and light curves suggest a
layer structure with intermediate mass elements on the
outside and nickel-iron material on the inside. Khokhlov
(1991) proposed that SN Ia light curves could be ex-
plained empirically by a “delayed detonation” scenario
in which the explosion starts in the core as a burning
deﬂagration wave, which is followed somehow by a deto-
nation wave of overlying unburned material. The initial
deﬂagration front pre-heats and expands the star’s outer
layers. The consequence is the burning of the outer layers
does not continue to completion and a layered structure

of intermediate mass elements is produced.

SN Ia explosions involve a complex interplay of tur-
bulent hydrodynamics, nuclear burning, conduction, ra-
diative transfer in iron-group rich material, and perhaps
magnetic ﬁelds (Khokhlov 1995; Niemeyer & Hillebrandt
1995; Livne 1999; Reinecke et al. 1999; Gamezo et al.
2004; R¨opke et al. 2012). This leads to signiﬁcant un-
certainties in the accuracy of the models. Several key
questions about expansion asymmetries and the overall
characteristics of SNe Ia could be resolved if one could
obtain direct observations of the distribution and kine-
matics of elements in young SN Ia remnants.

The bright historical nova seen in 1885 known as S An-
dromeda (S And) located just 16′′ away from M31’s nu-
cleus oﬀers an opportunity to study the expanding de-
bris of a SN Ia. Because of its central location in M31,
the remnant’s expanding ejecta is detectable not through
line emission but via resonance line absorption against
the background of the Andromeda galaxy’s bulge stars
(Fesen et al. 1989).

SN 1885 has been classiﬁed as a probable SN Ia as its
reported optical spectrum lacked hydrogen lines, deﬁning
it as Type I (de Vaucouleurs & Corwin 1985). Its red-
dish appearance and fast light curve is consistent with
subluminous Type Ia event (de Vaucouleurs & Corwin
1985) although this classiﬁcation has been questioned
(see Chevalier & Plait 1988; Pastorello et al. 2008;
Perets et al. 2011).

Images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
revealed a circular ≃ 0.′′75 diameter dark spot pro-
duced by a blend of Ca II H & K line absorption

(Fesen et al. 1999). Subsequent ultraviolet imaging of
the remnant with HST revealed a 0.′′5 diameter absorp-
tion spot likely due largely to saturated UV Fe II reso-
nance lines (Hamilton & Fesen 2000).

Spectra taken with Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS)
on HST established that the absorption was produced
principally by Ca II K & H 3934, 3968 ˚A, with additional
contributions from Ca I 4227 ˚A and Fe I 3441, 3720 ˚A
(Fesen et al. 1999). The remnant’s Ca II absorption was
found to extend to a velocity of ≃ 13 100 ± 1500 km s−1.
HST images taken in 2004 showed that the Ca II ab-
sorption is roughly spherical with a maximum diame-
ter of 0.′′8 (Fesen et al. 2007). At the known distance
785 ± 25 kpc of M31 (McConnachie et al. 2005), this an-
gular diameter corresponds to a mean expansion velocity
of 12 500 km s−1 over the ≃ 120 yr age of SN 1885. The
agreement between the remnant’s size and its expansion
velocity as measured in the Ca II absorption implies that
the SN 1885 remnant is still largely in free expansion.
This is also consistent with the remnant being an excep-
tionally weak radio source (Sjouwerman & Dickel 2001;
Hofmann et al. 2013) with no conﬁrmed associated X-ray
emission (Kaaret 2002).

Additional HST images obtained in 2010 and 2012
show extended low velocity Fe I absorption slightly oﬀ-
set to the east from the remnant’s center as deﬁned by
Ca II images, likely due to an ionization eﬀect caused by
self-shielding (Fesen et al. 2015). More signiﬁcant is the

appearance of the remnant’s apparent Fe II distribution
in a few streams or “plumes” of Fe-rich material extend-
ing out from the remnant’s center to ∼ 10 000 km s−1.
This arrangement is in sharp contrast to the remnant’s
Ca II absorption which extends out to 12 500 km s−1 but
is most concentrated in a clumpy shell spanning veloci-
ties of 2000 − 5000 km s−1.

Because its ejecta are in free expansion, the distribu-
tion of elements in the remnant of SN 1885 (hereafter
SNR 1885) is essentially the same as that shortly after
the explosion. The dominant element near the center of
the remnant at the present time is expected to be iron
and the dominant iron ionization species is expected to
be Fe II. The presence of Fe I in the FOS spectrum attests
to the relatively low ionization state of the supernova
ejecta in general more than a century after SN outburst.
The photoionization timescale of Fe I exposed to the ob-
served ﬂux of ultraviolet light from the bulge of M31 is
of order 10 years (Fesen et al. 1999) so the fact that Fe I
is still present can be attributed to partial self-shielding
by its own continuum optical depth.

Here we present optical and UV HST spectral data,
which resolves SNR 1885 absorption structure at various
locations in the remnant. This allows an examination
of the velocity distribution of the remnant’s Ca I, Ca II,
and Fe I line absorptions. The observations are described
in §2, results and implications discussed in §3, with a
summary of our ﬁndings and conclusions given in §4.

2. OBSERVATIONS
2.1. Data Collection

Optical and UV spectra of SNR 1885 were obtained us-
ing Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) using
the optical CCD detector (STIS/CCD) and the near ul-
traviolet Multi-Anode Microchannel Array (STIS/NUV-
MAMA) detector. Optical spectra are obtained using a
1024×1024 CCD covering a 52′′×52′′ ﬁeld of view with an
average pixel size of 0.′′05. Since the M31 bulge is faint
in the near-UV together with a relatively high level of
noise on the STIS/CCD, on-chip binning was performed
with 2 × 2 pixel binning resulting in a pixel size of 0.′′1
along the dispersion axis.

STIS/CCD optical spectra of SNR 1885 was observed
using a 52′′ × 0.′′2 slit and the G430L grating (2900 ˚A −
5700 ˚A; FWHM= 5.2 ˚A at 4000 ˚A). The observations
were obtained during twenty-four HST orbits in six dif-
ferent slit positions across the remnant. The slit posi-
tions relative to the remnant are shown in Figure 3 and
the corresponding observation dates are presented in Ta-
ble 1.

Each slit positioning observation required four orbits

and the observations were carried out during October
and December 2013. The total exposure time for each
group of observations was 10,785 s. Each orbit was com-
prised of four or ﬁve square-pattern dithered images to
remove cosmic rays. Additionally, in each group of ob-
servations the four images were shifted along the slit by
either 0.′′3 or 0.′′7 to help minimize eﬀects of noise from
the CCD (see Fig. 4).

STIS/NUV-MAMA ultraviolet spectra of SNR 1885
were obtained using a 1024 × 1024 pixel MAMA detec-
tor covering a 25′′ × 25′′ ﬁeld of view with an average
pixel size of 0.′′025. The STIS/NUV-MAMA observa-
tions employed a 52′′ × 0.′′5 slit and the G230L grating
(λ = 1570 ˚A − 3180 ˚A; FWHM=3.3 ˚A at 2800 ˚A).

The STIS/NUV-MAMA observations were taken dur-
ing ﬁfteen HST orbits at a single slit position and orien-
tation to maximize the signal-to-noise. The observations
were taken during December 2013 and January 2014.
The images were dithered along the slit by 0.′′3. The
total exposure time of the STIS/NUV-MAMA observa-
tions was 31,473 s.

Ca II H & K and Ca I 4227 ˚A absorption. This ﬁgure shows an example of hot and cold pixel corrections. Left: Raw individual images
before pixel corrections. The same portion of the CCD chip is shown in each image. The dithering of SNR 1885 along the slit can be seen
as a shift upward along the CCD from bottom to top. Right: Individual images post hot and cold pixel correction.

As a result of radiation damage of the STIS/CCD over
the course of its lifetime, a signiﬁcant number of detec-
tor pixels are no longer functioning or record either an
extremely high or low ﬂux value. Thus, extracting the
faint signal of SNR 1885 could not be done by simply av-
eraging or summing the dithered observations (see Fig.
5).

In order to correct for these bad pixels, we initially
generated a list of bad pixels that diﬀered from their

neighboring pixels by a factor of two. These corrections
were done only for a 1.′′1 region surrounding the center
of the remnant for each of the observations. The bad
pixels were then corrected using the IRAF routine FIX-
PIX, which uses linear interpolation from the neighbor-
ing pixels. However, this procedure was viewed as too
subjective and did not correct hot and cold pixels in the
bulge spectrum immediately surrounding the remnant.

Instead, we adopted a procedure where a mask of bad

pixels generated by setting a range of acceptable ﬂux val-
ues creating a list of pixels that exceeded this range. Be-
cause the ﬂux of the bulge and the sensitivity of the CCD
varied signiﬁcantly between the red and blue wavelengths
ends covered in the STIS spectra, acceptable ranges were
determined in narrow wavelength bins across the spec-
trum. Using the IRAF task IMREPLACE, the values of
bad pixels were replaced with a value equal to 1. The
IRAF task IMEXPR was used to create a mask list of
bad pixels. This pixel mask was then used as input for
FIXPIX and the bad pixels were replaced using linear
interpolation of neighboring pixels. An example of this
procedure for one slit position is shown in Figure 4, where
the left side corresponds to the raw images and the right
side corresponds to the cleaned images after pixel correc-
tions.

Following these corrections,

individual orbit images
were ﬂux scaled using continuum ﬂux values to correct
for overall observed ﬂux diﬀerences between the orbits.
Images were then co-aligned and averaged to form a 2D
spectrum at each slit position (see middle panel of Fig.
5).

Because SNR 1885 is detected in absorption against the
bulge of M31, the STIS/CCD spectrum contains both

SNR 1885’s intrinsic spectrum and M31’s bulge spec-
trum. Thus to extract SNR 1885’s spectrum, the back-
ground consisting of M31’s bulge spectrum must be re-
moved.

A STIS/CCD spectrum of M31’s bulge was generated
using the spectra surrounding the remnant in each of
the 24 orbits. Ten 0.′′9 wide regions were extracted from
above and below the remnant in each of the 24 orbits and
averaged together to form a single 0.′′9 average spectrum
for each observing direction. These two images were then
ﬂux scaled and averaged together to form a single 0.′′9
image of the M31 bulge spectra. Finally, this 0.′′9 bulge
spectra was averaged together to form the ﬁnal 1D M31
bulge spectrum seen in Figure 6.

Using this 1D bulge spectrum of M31, we divided the
remnant’s spectrum by the bulge spectrum to create a
fully corrected spectrum of SNR 1885. The ﬁnal 2D
spectra post background division is shown in the bot-
tom panel of Figure 5. This data reduction procedure
was applied to all slit positions. The resulting 2D spec-
tra are seen in Figure 7 with the rest wavelengths of Ca I
4227 A, Ca II H & K, and Fe I 3720 A labeled.

For each slit position, a single 1D spectrum was created
using only the center 0.′′3 region of the remnant since it
contained the highest signal to noise and avoided contam-
ination from the surrounding background region. The 1D
spectra from all six slit positions are shown in Figure 8.

2.3. STIS/NUV-MAMA Data Reduction

The STIS/NUV-MAMA observations of SNR 1885
were taken at a single slit position across the source but
with the source dithered along the detector. This ob-
serving conﬁguration allowed us to co-align all the orbits
and sum them to form a 2D spectrum of SNR 1885 in the
NUV. This spectrum again contains both the remnant’s
spectrum and the spectrum of M31’s bulge.

As done for the STIS/CCD data, M31’s bulge spec-
trum was found using the spectra surrounding the rem-

nant in the summed 2D spectrum. Fifteen 1.′′23 regions
were extracted from above and below the remnant and
averaged together to form a single 1.′′23 average spec-
trum. The individual pixels of this 2D image were then
averaged to form a single 1D bulge spectrum for M31.

The summed spectrum of SNR 1885 was divided by
M31’s bulge spectrum to create a spectrum only con-
taining the remnant’s intrinsic spectrum. The ﬁnal 2D
spectra post background division can be seen in Figure

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The goal of

3.1. Ca II H & K
taking STIS/CCD observations of
SNR 1885 in six separate slit positions was to investi-
gate the three dimensional structure of Ca II absorption
across the remnant. Variations in Ca II absorption could
indicate regions of increased or decreased Ca+ concen-
trations like those seen in prior narrow passband HST
Ca II images (Fesen et al. 2007, 2015). However, seeing
such variations is diﬃcult even with high signal-to-noise
data since the remnant’s Ca II H & K line absorption
blend is highly saturated.

The fairly noisy data of the STIS/CCD spectra added
to the diﬃculty in detecting signiﬁcant variations in the
Ca II line proﬁle. Furthermore, at λ ∼ 4000 ˚A, the
STIS/CCD spectrograph has a resolution of 400 km s−1
which limits the determination the radial velocities from
the spectra. Due to the high velocities of the Ca I and
Ca II in the remnant, there is an overlap between the
two absorption features causing an additional limitation

in determining the maximum radial velocities observed
for Ca II.

Despite these issues, variations of the strength of
the remnant’s Ca II absorption can be clearly seen in
the STIS spectra. Figure 7 shows the 2D spectra of
SNR 1885 at each of the six slit positions across the rem-
nant. Orientation B shows broader absorption features
overall compared to Orientation A. In addition, Orienta-
tion B shows more saturated absorption than Orientation
A.

The center slit, 2B, shows deep absorption of Ca II
3934, 3968 ˚A extending to 4100 ˚A (10 000 km s−1) on the
red side and 3790 ˚A (11 000 km s−1) on the blue side. For
comparison, in center slit 2A, the Ca II extends 4100 ˚A
on the red side and 3850 ˚A on the blue side. For slit
position 2B, the most extended Ca II features appear in
the central region of the remnant along the slit, whereas
for slit position 2A, the blue side is most extended near
the top of the remnant while the red side appears to be
more extended on the bottom. Determining the edges of
the Ca II is diﬃcult in the 2D spectra because the Ca II
overlaps with the broad Ca I feature on the red side and
with Fe I on the blue side.

For data taken in Orientation A, both oﬀ center slit
positions show a narrower Ca II absorption feature com-
pared to that of the central slit. Slit position 1A, which
went through the western portion of the remnant, shows
a Ca II absorption feature extending from 3900 ˚A to
4050 ˚A. The Ca II extends furthest in the middle of
the slit position 1A’s spectrum and there is a separation

ﬁned edge unlike slit positions 1A or 2A. On the red side
of the remnant, the edge is not as well deﬁned, as the
Ca II overlaps with the Ca I absorption.

In Orientation B, the oﬀ center slit positions show nar-
rower and less saturated Ca II absorption compared to
that of the central slit. For slit position 1B, which went

through the northern portion of the remnant, the Ca II
feature extends from 3840 ˚A to 4100 ˚A. On the red side
of the Ca II absorption, the feature appears asymmet-
ric with deeper absorption near the top of the remnant
along the slit. There does not appear to be a separation
between the Ca II and Ca I absorption features, how-
ever the depth of the absorption in the overlap region
is weaker compared to the central slit. For slit position
3B, which went through the southern portion of the rem-
nant, the Ca II feature extends from 3800 ˚A to 4100 ˚A.

Fig. 9.— Reduced 2D STIS/NUV-MAMA spectra for SNR 1885. The 0.7 arcsecond size of the remnant is noted on the right side of the

image in blue. The wavelength scale is given below the remnant in red.

The blue side of the Ca II feature is noisy, and is most
extended through the central region of the remnant along
the slit.

Figure 8 shows 1D spectra of SNR 1885 taken from
the center 0.′′3 through the remnant at each of the six
slit positions. All of the 1D spectra show that the Ca II
and Ca I absorptions overlap, as the ﬂux on the red side
of the feature does not return to the continuum value.
This overlap makes it diﬃcult to determine the maximum
radial velocity of the Ca II and Ca I in the remnant. The
1D spectra show that for slit position 2B Ca II extends to
at least 4095 ˚A (9500 km s−1) on the red side and 3790 ˚A
(−11 100 km s−1). Similarly, slit position 2A has Ca II on
the red side extending to at least 4105 ˚A (10 400 km s−1)
and on the blue side extending to 3835 ˚A (−7700 km s−1).

3.1.1. Changes Between 1996 and 2013

In 1996, a spectrum of SNR 1885 was obtained with the
FOS using a 0.′′43 diameter aperture, and showed strong
symmetric Ca II absorption, redshifted Ca I 4227 ˚A ab-
sorption, and strong Fe I 3720 ˚A absorption (Fesen et al.
1999). This spectrum is reproduced in the bottom panel
right panel of Figure 10 for comparison to the STIS/CCD
spectra taken in the center two slit positions.

In the 1996 FOS spectrum, the Ca II has a relative ﬂux
of approximately 0.25. while the STIS spectrum taken
at slit position 2B suggests a signiﬁcant increase in Ca II
absorption especially at negative radial velocities over the
last 17 years. However, the spectrum for slit position 2A
indicates virtually no increase in relative strength of the
Ca II absorption.

The diﬀerences in the relative intensity of the Ca II
absorption features between Orientations A and B are
shown in Figure 10. The apparent diﬀerences between
the new STIS spectra and the previous FOS spectrum
may have more to do with the larger FOS aperture sam-
pling more of the remnant than the narrow STIS slit
spectra than real changes in the Ca II during the last
two decades.

Interestingly ,however, the shape of the Ca II absorp-
tion feature does appear to have changed over the past
17 years. In the 1996 FOS spectrum, the Ca II feature
appears symmetric on both red and blue sides, while in
the STIS/CCD spectra the feature has a steep decrease
on the red side and a more gradual decrease on the blue
side. This diﬀerence in slope suggests that there is cur-
rently a higher density of Ca II on the far side of the
remnant.

3.1.2. A Ca II Shell

Figure 11 shows contour plots of the relative intensity
of the redshifted (far-side) Ca II feature as a function of
radial velocity and relative position in the remnant for
each of the six slit positions. The Ca II absorption can
be seen to extend to at least ∼ 10 000 km s−1. Since the
Ca II absorption feature overlaps with the Ca I feature,
the Ca II feature on the red side does not return the
continuum ﬂux value, and the maximum contour value
corresponds to the ﬂux in the overlapping region rather
than the continuum. As such the contour plots are not
good indicators for the location of the highest velocity
Ca II, but can serve as good indicators of the variations
in Ca II absorption at low velocity.

Across nearly all slit positions, there is an increased
Ca II absorption, seen as dark contours in Figure 11, be-
tween 2000 km s−1 and 4000 km s−1 indicative of a shell
of higher density Ca II on the far side of the remnant.
This increase in absorption is seen as a shell in the 2004
HST WFC Ca II image adapted from Fesen et al. (2007)
(see Fig. 12). The increased absorption is located 0.′′2
from the center of the remnant, corresponding to a ve-
locity of 4700 km s−1. This implies that the Ca II is not
uniformly distributed throughout the remnant, but in-
stead has clumps of higher density within a thick shell.

3.1.3. Expansion Asymmetry

Deep Ca II images of SNR 1885 show it to have a diam-
eter ≃ 0.′′8 (see Fig. 12). This corresponds undecelerated
Ca II-rich debris traveling at a rate of 12 500 km s−1 in
the plane of the sky. In the STIS/CCD spectra, we mea-
sure a maximum radial velocity of 11 900 km s−1 in slit
position 3B. (Note: In the two center slits the maximum
measured radial velocity of the Ca II is 10 400 km s−1
(2A) and −11 100 km s−1 (2B).)

Transverse velocity measures the expansion in the
plane of the sky, while the radial velocity measures the
expansion along the sight. There is a ∼ 5% diﬀer-
ence between the maximum radial velocity measured in
the STIS/CCD spectra (11 900 km s−1) and the trans-
verse velocity determined from the HST Ca II image
(12 500 km s−1).
Since the Ca II absorption in the
STIS/CCD spectra overlaps with Ca I and Fe I absorp-
tions, the radial velocities are likely underestimates of the
true maximum radial velocity of the Ca II. For compar-
ison, the radial velocity determined from spectral line
ﬁtting of the 1996 FOS spectra was ∼ 13 000 km s−1
(Fesen et al. 1999).

Diﬀerences in the radial and transverse velocities could

Fig. 11.— Contour plots of the redshifted (far-side) Ca II absorption of SNR 1885. The relative position in arcseconds is determined

slit positions noted at the top of each contour plot correspond to the slit positions shown in Figure 3.

imply that the ejecta is not expanding freely, or that the
remnant’s expansion as measured by Ca-rich debris is not
perfectly symmetric. The remnant lies within the bulge
of M31 where there are other stars in various evolution-
ary phases hence could be colliding with material given
oﬀ by bulge stars as they evolve into the red giant phase.

3.2. Ca I

For all slit positions in the 2D STIS/CCD spectra
shown in Figure 7, there is absorption to the right of the
Ca II 3934, 3968 ˚A feature, which is attributed to Ca I
4227 ˚A (Fesen et al. 1999). From our 2D spectra, the
central slit 2A shows the broadest Ca I absorption from
4125 ˚A to 4390 ˚A. The line center of the Ca I feature
appears redshifted by some 30 ˚A (2100 km s−1). In ad-
dition, the Ca I absorption appears asymmetric, where
there is deeper absorption on the blue side of the line
center compared to the red. Additionally, the Ca I ab-
sorption appears stronger toward the northern portion of
the remnant.

For Orientation B there appears to be uniform Ca I ab-
sorption along the height of the remnant between 4110 ˚A
and 4350 ˚A in slit 2B. As seen before in Orientation A,

the Ca I absorption feature is stronger on the blue side
than the red side suggesting that the blue side has a
higher density of Ca I than the red side.

The weakest Ca I absorption appears in the southern
(slit 3B) and western (slit 1A) portions of the remnant.
Slit position 1B, on the north side of the remnant, has a
Ca I feature which is symmetric along the height of the
remnant, but again has stronger absorption on the blue
side than the red side. Finally, slit position 3A, located
on the eastern side of the remnant, has uniform Ca I
absorption across the slit centered on the Ca I 4227 ˚A
line.

Comparison of the 2D (Fig. 7) and 1D (Fig. 8) spectra
consistently show an asymmetry in the Ca I absorption.
For example, the Ca I feature is broader in the 1D spec-
trum compared to the 2D spectrum for slit position 2B.
The Ca I absorption is measured to be between 4095 ˚A
and 4400 ˚A, corresponding to radial velocities between
−9400 km s−1 and 12 400 km s−1. Similarly, in the 1D
spectra, for slit position 2A, the Ca I absorption is a
narrower compared to 2B, spanning between 4120 ˚A and
4380 ˚A or −7600 km s−1 and 10 900 km s−1. It is impor-
tant to note that the velocities on the blue side of the

remnant may be underestimates of the true radial veloc-
ity because of the overlap between the Ca I and Ca II
absorption features.

Our 1D spectrum for slit position 3B conﬁrms weak
Ca I between 4125 ˚A and 4310 ˚A. The Ca I absorption
feature has a relative ﬂux of ≈ 0.85 times the ﬂux of the
bulge. For slit position 1A, the Ca I is detected between
4115 ˚A and 4385 ˚A with a relative ﬂux of ≈ 0.8. Slit
position 3A, has an overall noisy detection of Ca I from
its 1D spectrum, between 4115 ˚A and 4375 ˚A, at a ﬂux
of ≈ 0.8 times the ﬂux of the bulge. Ca I was detected in
slit 1B between 4120 ˚A and 4345 ˚A with a ﬂux of ≈ 0.8
times the bulge ﬂux.

Interestingly, from the 1D spectra for all slit positions
except 3B, the line center of Ca I feature appears red-
shifted by ∼ 1500 km s−1. Fesen et al. (1999) also re-
ported a redshifted Ca I absorption feature in the FOS
spectrum (see Fig. 10), by ∼ 1100 km s−1. Fesen et al.
(2007) argued that redshifted line center of the Ca I ab-
sorption observed in the FOS spectrum could not be ac-
counted for by an anisotropic photoionization model be-
cause there should be more ionization on the side closer
to the bulge. Anisotropic photoionization would result
in an asymmetric Ca I line proﬁle that is blueshifted.

In the 1996 FOS spectrum, the Ca I absorption proﬁle
is symmetric about its redshifted line center. However,
the 2013 STIS/CCD spectra are asymmetric about their
redshifted line center, having decreased ﬂux at high ve-
locity on the red side. This decreased ﬂux at high velocity
could be accounted for by an anisotropic photoionization
model because the highest velocity Ca I is being ionized
more quickly as it is closer to the bulge.

However, an anisotropic photoionization model is not
the only possible explanation for the decreased ﬂux at
high velocity Ca I. A reverse shock would also diminish
the high velocity Ca I, but might similarly aﬀect both the
red and blue sides of the remnant. Since the blue side
overlaps with Ca II, it is not possible to tell if the blue
side also has diminished ﬂux at high velocity, so this ex-
planation cannot be fully investigated. However, the pos-
sibility of a strong reverse shock is unlikely as SNR 1885
is an extremely weak radio source (Sjouwerman & Dickel
2001; Hofmann et al. 2013) and there has been no con-
ﬁrmed x-ray emission (Kaaret 2002), which would be ex-

pected from an interacting ejecta.

Additionally, the 1D spectra through the center of the
remnant for observing Orientation B shows Ca I absorp-
tion on the far side of the remnant out to 12 400 km s−1.
This high velocity absorption is not seen for Ca II absorp-
tion. The HST Ca II image shows some faint, extended
absorption in the southwest region of the remnant (see
Fig. 12). This extended Ca II absorption has a trans-
verse velocity of approximately 14 000 km s−1.

This extended absorption is only seen in the spectra
for slit position 2B suggesting that there are regions with
slightly higher expansion velocities. It is not possible to
tell if this extension occurs on the near side of the rem-
nant because of the overlap between the Ca I and Ca II
absorption features. Furthermore, in the Ca II image
the extended absorption only occurs in one region also
supporting the notion that the remnant has an asym-
metric distribution of Ca. Consequently, it appears clear
that any asymmetries in the expansion of SNR 1885 are
relatively small.

3.3. Fe I

Detection of Fe I 3720 ˚A was not obvious from the 2D
STIS/CCD spectra in Figure 7. The data shortward of
3800 ˚A is extremely noisy due to the lower background
bulge ﬂux and the CCD’s lower eﬃciency at blue wave-
lengths. However, the average 0.′′3 spectra from the cen-
ter regions of each slit (see Fig. 8) provide evidence for
a weak detection of Fe I. The center slit positions pro-
vide the clearest detection of Fe I at wavelengths blue of
3720 ˚A, and show that the Fe I absorption is a shell.

In the bottom left panel of Figure 10, which overlays
the 1D spectra from the two center slit positions, it is
clear that there are two separate absorption features cen-
tered about λ = 3720 ˚A. For slit position 2A, the blue
side of Fe I absorption is between 3610 ˚A (−9000 km s−1)
and 3695 ˚A (−2100 km s). The red side is between 3750 ˚A
(2400 km s−1) and 3820 ˚A (8000 km s).

The blue side of the Fe I absorption feature for
slit position 2B is between 3600 ˚A (−9900 km s−1) and
3685 ˚A (−2900 km s). The red side is between 3720 ˚A
(∼ 0 km s−1) and 3790 ˚A (5500 km s−1). For slit position
2B, the red side of the Fe I absorption and blue side of

Fig. 13.— Figure showing inferred distributions of Ca I, Ca II, Fe I from this spectral study along with the 2D distribution of Fe II as

seen in HST imaging (Fesen et al. 2015). The circles (radius = 0.40”) correspond to an average expansion velocity of 12 500 km s−1.

Ca I absorption features overlap, so the maximum radial
velocity of the Fe I on the red side may be an underesti-
mate.

Compared to the 1996 FOS spectrum, the STIS/CCD
spectra have a weak detection of Fe I 3720 ˚A. In the FOS
spectra, the blue side of the bell shaped Fe I absorption
is seen, while the red side overlaps with Ca II. There
is no indication of a shell in the FOS spectra.
In the
STIS/CCD spectra, the blue side of the Fe I absorption
is clearly separated from the red side and bell-shaped
absorption is not clear.

The 2009 and 2010 HST Fe I images do not indicate
that Fe I in a shell (Fesen et al. 2015). The HST Fe I
images indicate the Fe I is located in a region approx-
imately 0.′′4 in diameter oﬀset to the Northeast of the
Ca II center by approximately 0.′′1. The size of the Fe I
in the images indicates that the Fe I extends to a trans-
verse velocity of ≈ 6000 km s−1. The STIS/CCD spectra
and HST Fe I images together indicate that the concen-
tration of Fe I in the Northeast region of the remnant is
located in a shell.

Furthermore, Fesen et al. (2015) presented HST Fe II
images that indicate the Fe II is located in ﬁnger-like
plumes extending out to ≈ 0.′′3 (10 000 km s−1). The
images also indicate that there is Fe II located outside of
the plumes which also extends out to 10 000 km s−1. The
Fe II images also show higher concentrations of Fe II in
the center, with less absorption on the edges. The Fe I
velocities found from the STIS/CCD spectra conﬁrm the
presence of Fe material at high velocities, although the
Fe is still located closer to the center of the remnant than
the Ca. Furthermore, the shell structure of Fe I in the

spectra is consistent with a region of higher ionization in
the center of the remnant, where the Fe would have been
located in a higher ionization state.

3.4. NUV-MAMA

The STIS/NUV-MAMA observations are presented in
Figure 9. The STIS/NUV-MAMA observations are ex-
tremely noisy, but show a detection of weak absorption
below 3000 ˚A. The predicted UV spectra shown in Figure
1 has highly saturated absorption between 2500 ˚A and
3000 ˚A. Below approximately 2500 ˚A, the STIS/NUV-
MAMA observations become overwhelmed by noise and
no clear signal can be detected. The STIS/NUV-MAMA
absorption is seen across an area of 0.′′7 consistent with
the size of SNR 1885 as determined from previous HST
images.

Since the bulge ﬂux of M31 is weak in the UV, the sig-
nal to noise for the detection of SNR 1885 is extremely
low. It is not possible to determine whether certain areas
of the remnant have increased concentrations of absorp-
tion because the diﬀerences in absorption at the level
of the noise seen outside the remnant. Additionally, it
is not possible to determine which features belong to a
given element because the absorption is broad and the
model spectra predicted large overlap in absorption be-
tween diﬀerent features.

3.5. Comparison to SN Ia Models

Figure 13 shows a summary of derived spatial distri-
butions of Ca I, Ca II, and Fe I in SNR 1885 based on
the STIS spectra. Also shown in the 2D distribution

of Fe II as shown in Fesen et al. (2015) from HST im-
ages. Below we discuss our spectral results for S And
in light of various classes of explosion models for ther-
modynamical supernovae. As previously suggested, one
likely mechanism for SNe Ia is the explosion of oﬀ-center
delayed-detonation model for a WD close to MC h.

Within the DDT scenario, most of the C/O WD is
burned and thus the explosion energies and the density
and velocity structures are similar over a wide range of
brightness (H¨oﬂich et al. 2002). Which elements are pro-
duced depend mostly on the competition between expan-
sion and nuclear burning, and at high temperatures and
densities nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). While ex-
pansion timescales, ≈ 1sec, are controlled by hydrody-
namics, nuclear burning timescales and NSE are dom-
inated by the temperature under which burning takes
place which is a function of the amount of fuel per vol-
ume, i.e., the density under which burning takes place.

For C/O mixtures, Ca is produced in a density range
between ≈ 1.5 × 107 and ≈ 5 × 106 g cm−3. At higher
densities, Ca is destroyed due to the shift toward NSE.
At the inner edge of this density range, Ca is produced
during the deﬂagration phase whereas at the outer edge
Ca production is governed by the detonation phase of
burning. The size of the Ca-hole depends mostly on the
initial central density of the exploding WD and, thus,
the WD mass (H¨oﬂich et al. 1998; Diamond et al. 2015).
To be consistent with a minimum Ca velocity of 2000
km s−1 as seen in S And, MW D must be close (within
∼ 0.05 M⊙) to MC h. This is an lower limit set by mix-
ing. For Branch-normal SNe Ia within the DDT scenario
and with suppressed mixing, the total 56Ni production
and the outer edge of Ca both depend the DDT transi-
tion. As discussed in Fesen et al. (2007), the brightness
of SN 1885 is consistent with the maximum Ca velocity
observed, suggesting the inner edge of Ca is insensitive
on SN brightness.

Our STIS optical spectra of SNR 1885 show no ev-
idence for extensive mixing as would be expected in a
deﬂagration explosion. The fairly restricted expansion
velocities for Ca and Fe-rich ejecta are consistent with
previous analyzes which suggested a M(CH) mass model
with an oﬀ-center, deﬂagration to detonation transition
at the lower end of ‘Branch-normal’ SNe Ia like that of
SN 1986g.

Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd Ca-rich material to be mainly con-
centrated in a shell of intermediate expansion velocities.
This is in contrast to HST Fe II images which show a cen-
tral Fe-rich region plus only a handful of Fe-rich plumes
extending out to the edge of the Ca-rich region. Such
a layered structure supports the picture of a delayed-
detonation transition explosion along with a clumpy
structure typical of RT instabilities during the initial de-
ﬂagration phase. The degree of Ca and Fe mixing ap-
pears greatly suppressed compared to expectations from
3D hydro calculations which would be expected to mix
the remnant’s entire central region (Gamezo et al. 2003;
Reinecke et al. 2002; R¨opke et al. 2012). One possible
mechanism for R-T suppression is high magnetic ﬁelds
(H¨oﬂich et al. 2013; Penney et al. 2014; Diamond et al.
2015).

Given the diversity of thermonuclear supernovae and
the uncertainties in light curves of SN 1885, there

is a wide range of possible explosion mechanisms for
S And. Brieﬂy these are:
(1) Chandraskhar mass
MC h models where the explosion is triggered by com-
pressional heat close to the center when the WD ap-
proaches MC h, (2) An explosion triggered by heat re-
leased during the dynamical merging or collisions two
WDs and (3) A double detonation He-detonation sce-
nario where a C/O WD star accretes He-rich material at
a low rate to prevent burning and the explosion is trig-
gered from ignition of the surface He layer which gen-
erates a shock wave leading to the detonation of under-
lying of C/O (Nomoto 1982; Woosley & Weaver 1994;
H¨oﬂich & Khokhlov 1996; Kromer et al. 2010).

The observed symmetry in S And’s Ca-rich inner layer
and the remnant’s overall uniform expansion velocities do
not support a violent merger of WDs. Likewise, the pres-
ence of a deﬂagration phase creating R-T scale clumps
would seem to disfavor a double detonation type of event.
This leaves the conventional Chandraskhar mass explo-
sion model. Such a model is consistent with many of
S And’s observed properties including its clumpy Ca-rich
inner ring caused by high density burning.

In summary, the spectral data presented here show
evidence for a detonation phase which includes the
layered structure of burning products and a distribu-
tion of Ca-rich ejecta concentrated in a shell. The Fe
distribution in the inner layers exhibits plumes with
a scale height typical
for Rayleigh Taylor instabili-
ties in all directions. However, the extend of mixing
is signiﬁcantly lower than expected from pure hydro-
simulations. Within the framework of spherical explo-
sions, MCH ≈ 1.25M⊙ models are suggested based on
vCa(min) (H¨oﬂich & Khokhlov 1996) but the morphol-
ogy is inconsistent with the structures seen in the S And
remnant.

4. CONCLUSIONS

Our 2013 and 2014 STIS spectra provide insight into
the three dimensional structure of the S And remnant
(SNR 1885). From these data, we obtained the following
results:

1) The remnant’s broad Ca II H & K absorption ex-
tends out to at least 11 500 km s−1 on both the near and
far sides, consistent with the remnant’s angular dimen-
sions seen in previous HST narrow passband Ca II images
of S And. We ﬁnd enhancements of Ca II absorption be-
tween expansion velocities of 2000 and 5000 km s−1 sug-
gestive of a clumpy Ca II-rich shell, consistent with prior
2D Ca II images. In addition, the scale of the Ca clumps
seen in the direct 2D images matches the observed range
of expansion velocities of the Ca clumps.

2) Radial velocities from the STIS spectra together
with implied transverse velocities from prior HST im-
ages for Ca II absorptions diﬀer by only slightly suggest-
ing the remnant’s expansion appears is approximately
symmetric in three dimensions. The STIS spectra, when
taken together with previous direct HST images indicate
a remnant with less than a 10% departure from purely
spherical expansion.

3) Remarkably, even after nearly 130 years the
STIS/CCD spectra indicate that there is still a high con-
centration of Ca I throughout SNR 1885. We ﬁnd Ca I
4227 ˚A absorption extending out to 12 400 km s−1. This
absorption is seen to be asymmetric and redshifted to-

ward the bulge ≈ 1500 km s−1, consistent with the 1996
FOS spectrum. A decrease in Ca I absorption overall and
at high velocity is in agreement with the results predicted
by Fesen et al. (1999).

4) The STIS spectra reveal weak Fe I 3720 ˚A absorption
conﬁned to a shell with expansion velocities between 2000
and 9000 km s−1 on both the near and far sides of the
remnant. The fact that this shell starts at approximately
2000 km s−1 is consistent with Fe II 2D images which
show a concentration of Fe II near the remnant’s center.
5) UV STIS/MAMA spectra covering 1570 − 3180 ˚A
and taken with a 0.′′5 wide slit in only one orientation
show weak and broad absorption shortward of 3000 ˚A
consistent with model predictions.

Taken together with previous HST images, the new
spectra show the remnant of SN 1885 has a layered struc-
ture with sharp and well deﬁned Ca-rich outer edge con-
sistent with a delayed detonation phase. The remnant’s

clumpy inner Ca-rich shell plus only a handful of Fe-
rich plumes is unlike morphologies expected from dy-
namical or violent merger scenarios.
Instead, a small
number of Fe-rich plumes suggest their formation dur-
ing a deﬂagration phase by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities
but less well developed without extended mixing as ex-
pected from hydrodynamic calculations. The suppres-
sion of strong Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities is possibly
the result of strong magnetic ﬁelds. As a likely sce-
nario, we propose SN 1885 was an oﬀ-center, delayed
detonation and slightly subluminous SN Ia event similar
to SN 1986g.
