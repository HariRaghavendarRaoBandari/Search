quarks in a transport model

We studied the number of constituent quark scaling (NCQ) behaviour of elliptic ﬂow (v2) under
the framework of A Multi-Phase Transport model (AMPT) at both top-RHIC and LHC energies.
The NCQ-scaling in v2 holds at top-RHIC energy with AMPT string melting version, while it breaks
in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energy using the same framework. The breaking of NCQ-scaling at
LHC energy has been studied by varying the magnitude of parton-parton scattering cross-section
and lifetime of hadronic cascade as implemented in AMPT. We ﬁnd that the breaking of NCQ
scaling in Pb+Pb collisions at √sN N =2.76 TeV is independent of the magnitude of parton-parton
cross-section and the later stage hadronic interactions. Further we observed that scaling holds in
a small collision system like Si+Si at √sN N = 2.76 TeV. We discussed that the breaking of NCQ
scaling is possibly due to high phase-space density of constituents quarks in Pb+Pb collisions at
√sN N = 2.76 TeV.

INTRODUCTION

Relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments aim to
study the formation and evolution of a strongly in-
teracting matter called Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)
[1]. Experiments at Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider (RHIC) and at CERN Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) established the existence of such
strongly interacting matter, which is expected to be
formed micro-seconds after the big-bang.
The elliptic ﬂow parameter, v2, which is deﬁned as a
second harmonic coeﬃcient of the azimuthal Fourier
decomposition of the momentum distribution of pro-
duced particles has been widely used as an excellent
tool for understanding the dynamics of the system
formed in the early stages of high-energy heavy-ion
collisions [2–8]. This ﬂow parameter v2 is extracted
by studying the correlation of produced particles
with respect to the reaction plane (Ψ) as,

v2 = hcos(2(φ − Ψ))i,

(1)

where φ is the azimuthal angle of the produced par-
ticles [9].
Results from RHIC-experiments show that at low
transverse momentum (pT < 2 GeV/c), there is
a clear mass-ordering of v2 among the identiﬁed
hadrons [10, 11].
It is observed that at ﬁxed pT ,
heavier hadrons have smaller values of v2 than the
lighter ones. Hydrodynamic calculations suggest
that the interplay between radial and elliptic ﬂow
plays an important role in determining the mass-
ordering of v2 at low pT [2–7]. Subsequent later stage
hadronic re-scattering can also distort v2 at low
pT [12]. It is observed that in the intermediate-pT
region (2.0 < pT < 4.0 GeV/c), the pT -diﬀerential v2
of baryons and mesons form separate groups [10, 11].

Such a baryon-meson splitting in v2 is success-
fully reproduced by models where quark-coalescence
mechanism is considered to be the dominant process
for hadronization in this pT -regime [13, 14]. When
both v2 and pT of identiﬁed hadrons are divided by
number of constituent quarks (nq), all the hadrons
follow an approximate scaling behaviour. This is
known as number of constituent quark (NCQ) scal-
ing. The origin of such scaling is interpreted as an
evidence for dominance of quark degrees of freedom
in the early stages of heavy-ion collision. Another
way of representing NCQ scaling is to plot nq scaled
v2 as a function of (mT −m0)/nq, where mT is trans-
verse mass and m0 is the rest mass of hadron.
Recent v2 results from LHC [15] show similar trend
of mass-ordering among the identiﬁed hadrons at low
pT (< 3 GeV/c) and about 30% increase in radial
ﬂow than the top-RHIC energy. But in the inter-
mediate pT region (3.0 < pT < 6.0 GeV/c), the v2
results do not seem to follow NCQ-scaling as ob-
served in lower energy RHIC experiments. The v2
of identiﬁed hadrons at LHC energy deviates from
NCQ-scaling at a level of 20%. This observation has
triggered theoretical debate over the NCQ-scaling.
A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model with
string melting version (which includes parton coa-
lescence) has been used to reproduce the observed
NCQ-scaling in v2 at top-RHIC energies [16].
In
this paper, we investigated the behaviour of NCQ-
scaling both at top-RHIC and LHC energies using
the framework of AMPT model to understand the
reason behind it’s breaking at higher energies.
This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we
brieﬂy discuss the AMPT model. In section III, we
describe the NCQ-scaling behaviour of v2 of identi-
ﬁed hadrons at top-RHIC and LHC energies using

the AMPT model (version 1.11). The results are
summarized in section IV.

II. THE AMPT MODEL

The AMPT model, which is a hybrid transport
model, has four main stages: the initial conditions,
partonic interactions, the conversion from the par-
tonic to the hadronic matter, and hadronic inter-
actions [16].
It uses the same initial conditions as
HIJING [17]. Scattering among partons are mod-
elled by Zhang’s parton cascade [18], which calcu-
lates two-body parton scatterings using cross sec-
tions from pQCD with screening masses. In the de-
fault AMPT model, partons are recombined with
their parent strings and when they stop interact-
ing, the resulting strings fragment into hadrons ac-
cording to the Lund string fragmentation model [19].
However, in the string melting scenario (labeled as
AMPT-SM), these strings are converted to soft par-
tons and a quark coalescence model is used to com-
bine partons into hadrons. The evolution dynamics
of the hadronic matter is described by A Relativistic
Transport (ART) model. The interactions between
the minijet partons in the AMPT Default model and
those between partons in the AMPT-SM could give
rise to substantial v2. The parton-parton interac-
tion cross section in the string-melting version of the
AMPT is taken to be 3 mb and 10 mb. In this study,
approximately 500 K (50 K) events for each conﬁg-
uration were generated for minimum-bias Au+Au
(Pb+Pb) collisions.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

It has been observed that NCQ scaling in v2 holds
for AMPT with string melting scenario, which in-
corporates partonic coalescence mechanism, but no
such scaling occurs in the default AMPT [20]. We
studied the energy dependence of such scaling using
AMPT-SM, mainly at top RHIC and LHC energies.
Fig 1 shows v2/nq as a function of (mT − m0)/nq for
some selected hadrons (π, K, K 0
S, p and Λ) in min-
imum bias Au+Au collisions at √sN N = 200 GeV
using AMPT-SM model. A clear scaling is observed
among all hadrons consistent with the observation in
Ref
[20]. Here we used parton-parton cross-section
(σP P ) equal to 3 mb and hadron cascade time (τ )
equal to 30 fm in these results.
After observing a clear scaling at 200 GeV, we
studied NCQ scaling in Pb+Pb collisions at √sN N
= 2.76 TeV using AMPT-SM model as shown in
Fig. 2. A clear breaking of scaling is observed for
(mT − m0)/nq > 0.4 GeV/c2, which is very striking
and interesting as we have used AMPT-SM model.
Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) show scaling results where the
magnitude of σP P has been taken as 3 mb and 10
mb, respectively, keeping same hadron cascade time
(30 fm).
It is clear that scaling breaks down for
both the values of σP P . This indicates that the
breakdown of NCQ scaling at √sN N = 2.76 TeV
is independent of magnitude of parton-parton cross-
section.

One possible reason for the violation may be
the distortion of
initially developed v2 by later
hadronic interaction. To check this eﬀect, we turn-
oﬀ hadronic cascade in AMPT model. This can
be done by setting input parameter Nt=3, which
gives hadron cascade time equal to 0.6 fm (minimum
hadron cascade time in AMPT). The NCQ scaling
result from AMPT-SM (σP P = 10 mb) with hadron
cascade time 0.6 fm is shown in Fig. 3. In this case
too we have observed that the scaling breaks, indi-
cating that it is not due to the hadronic interactions
at √sN N = 2.76 TeV.

and 2.76 TeV, respectively. Therefore, the breaking
of NCQ scaling in AMPT-SM model for Pb+Pb col-
lision at √sN N = 2.76 TeV is not due to change in
v2(pT ) of underlying quarks.

B. Eﬀect of parton density in coalescence

mechanism

Let us recall the formalism of coalescence mecha-
nism. In a simpliﬁed coalescence scenario, the prob-
ability that the constituents a and b will form a com-
posite object C [13] is

strong transverse expansion at LHC energy could be
the reason for NCQ scaling violation. To understand
such behavior in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV , we
have checked underlying v2(pT ) for diﬀerent quark
ﬂavors in AMPT-SM model.
The v2 of u, d and s quarks as a function of pT in
the AMPT-SM model (σP P = 3 mb) are shown in
Fig. 4 (a) and 4 (b) for √sN N = 200 GeV (Au+Au)
and 2.76 TeV (Pb+Pb), respectively. Ratios with re-
spect to u-quark v2 are shown in the corresponding
lower panel. We have observed that the v2(pT ) of u
, d and s quarks are the same for both the energies
in AMPT-SM model. However, for pT < 0.5 GeV/c,
magnitude of s-quark v2 is slightly lower than that of
u and d. It is clear from Fig. 4 that the v2(pT ) distri-
bution for diﬀerent quark ﬂavors is similar for both
Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at √sN N = 200 GeV

of quarks is very high, the probability to ﬁnd another
quark in vicinity will be close to unity. So the ﬁnal
composite v2 of hadron will be linear in terms of the
quark’s v2 and hence breaking the scaling relation.
On the other hand for low density, a quark has a
small probability of ﬁnding another quarks to coa-
lesce, and Eq. 2, 4 and 5 will be valid.
So the change in phase space density of quarks can
aﬀect coalescence mechanism and it can be studied
using AMPT model. We generated 2 million Si+Si
collision events at √sN N = 2.76 TeV using the same
AMPT-SM conﬁguration (σP P = 3 mb, τ =0.6 fm).
Because of small system size, we would expect a
smaller density compared to that in Pb+Pb colli-
sions. So if NCQ-scaling at LHC energies in Pb+Pb
collisions breaks due to high density of partons, the
scaling might hold in Si+Si collision system at same
centre-of-mass energy. Fig. 5 shows the NCQ scal-
ing plot for minimum bias Si+Si system at √sN N =
2.76 TeV. We can see that NCQ scaling holds much
better than Pb+Pb system. This conﬁrms that the
breaking of NCQ-scaling of v2 in Pb+Pb collisions
at √sN N = 2.76 TeV is due to very high phase-space
density of initially produced quarks.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In summary, we have studied the number of con-
stituent quark scaling in v2 for hadrons at top-RHIC
and LHC energies using AMPT-SM model. We have
observed that while NCQ-scaling holds at √sN N =
200 GeV but model fails to reproduce the same in
Pb+Pb collisions at √sN N = 2.76 TeV. We have

observed the breaking in NCQ scaling at √sN N =
2.76 TeV is independent of the magnitude of parton-
parton cross-section and also not due to later stage
hadronic interactions. We also compared v2 of u, d
and s quarks as a function of pT for Au+Au and
Pb+Pb collisions in AMPT-SM model to see any
possible change in underlying quark v2(pT ) due large
radial ﬂow at LHC energy. We ﬁnd v2(pT ) of u,
d and s quarks shows similar behaviour for both
Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions. Therefore, the viola-
tion in NCQ scaling is not due to change in underly-
ing quark v2(pT ) in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energy.

Further we checked the eﬀect of parton’s phase-space
density on NCQ scaling behaviour within the frame-
work of coalescence. We observed that the scal-
ing holds in a small collision system like Si+Si at
√sN N = 2.76 TeV where the phase-space density of
constituent quarks is not very high as compared to
Pb+Pb . This observation can be well understood
in the framework of coalescence mechanism. Our

study shows that the NCQ-scaling in v2 is not a nec-
essary condition for quark coalescence when phase-
space density of constituent quarks is very high, e.g
Pb+Pb collision LHC energies.
