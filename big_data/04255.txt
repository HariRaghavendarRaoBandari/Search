Abstract

Considered is N = 2 SU(Nc) or U(Nc) SQCD with Nc + 1 < NF < 2Nc − 1 quark ﬂavors with
the mass term mTr (QQ) in the superpotential. It is softly broken down to N = 1 by the mass term
µxTr (X 2) of colored adjoint scalar partners of gluons, µx ≪ Λ2 ( Λ2 is the scale factor of the SU(Nc)
gauge coupling).
There is a large number of diﬀerent types of vacua in this theory with both unbroken and sponta-
neously broken global ﬂavor symmetry U(NF ) → U(n1) × U(n2). We consider in this paper the large
subset of these vacua with the unbroken nontrivial Z2Nc−NF ≥2 discrete symmetry, at diﬀerent hierar-
chies between the Lagrangian parameters m ≷ Λ2, µx ≷ m. The forms of low energy Lagrangians,
quantum numbers of light particles and mass spectra are described for all these vacua.

Our results diﬀer from corresponding results in recent related papers arXiv:1304.0822; 1403.6086
of M.Shifman and A.Yung, and we explain in the text the reasons for these diﬀerences (see also an
extended critique of a number of results from arXiv:1304.0822; 1403.6086 in arXiv:1308.5863,v4).

The masses and quantum numbers of BPS particles in N = 2 SU(2) SYM and SU(2) SQCD with
NF = 1...4 quark ﬂavors at small µx 6= 0 were found in seminal papers of N. Seiberg and E. Witten
[1, 2]. They presented in particular the corresponding elliptic curves from which the masses and
quantum numbers of these BPS particles can be calculated at µx → 0. The forms of these elliptic
curves have been generalized then, in particular, to N = 2 SU(Nc) SYM [3] and N = 2 SU(Nc)
SQCD with 1 ≤ NF ≤ 2Nc quark ﬂavors [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
In what follows we deal mainly with N = 2 SU(Nc) SQCD with Nc + 1 < NF < 2Nc − 1 ﬂavors

where {φi} is a set of gauge invariant co-ordinates on the moduli space. Note that, as it is, this curve
can be used for the calculation of BPS particle masses at µx → 0 only.
In principle, it is possible to ﬁnd at µx → 0 from the curve (1.2) the quantum numbers and masses
of all massive and massless BPS particles in diﬀerent multiple vacua of this theory. But in practice it
is very diﬃcult to do this for general values of Nc and NF , especially as for quantum numbers. The
important property of the SU(Nc) curve (1.2) which will be used in the text below is that there is
maximum Nc − 1 double roots. And the vacua we will deal with below at µx 6= 0 are just these vacua.
In other words, in all vacua we will deal with, the SU(Nc) curve (1.2) has Nc − 1 double roots and two
single roots.
In [8] the ﬁrst detailed attempt has been made (only the case m = 0 was considered) to classify the
vacua of (1.1) for general values of Nc and NF , to ﬁnd quantum numbers of light particles (massless
at µx → 0) in these vacua and forms of low energy Lagrangians. It was found in particular that in all
vacua the SU(Nc) gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously at the scale µ ∼ Λ2 by higgsed adjoint
scalars, hX adj
That this should happen can be understood qualitatively as follows [9]. The perturbative NSVZ
β-function of the massless N = 2 SQCD is exactly one loop [10, 11]. Therefore, at (2Nc − NF ) > 0
and small µx and m, the coupling g2(µ) is well deﬁned at µ ≫ Λ2, has a pole at µ = Λ2 and becomes
negative at µ < Λ2. To avoid this unphysical behavior, the ﬁeld X is necessarily higgsed breaking
the SU(Nc) group, with (at least some) components hX Ai ∼ Λ2. Recall that exact values of hX Ai
account for nonperturbative instanton contributions. And it is worth also to note that, in N = 2
SQCD with small m and µx, if there will be no some components hX Ai ∼ Λ2, i.e. all hX Ai ≪ Λ2, the
nonperturbative instanton contributions will be also non operative at the scale Λ2 without both the
corresponding fermion masses ∼ Λ2 and the infrared cut oﬀ ρ . 1/Λ2 supplied by some hX Ai ∼ Λ2,
so that the problem with g2(µ < Λ2) < 0 will survive. Moreover, for the same reasons, if there remains
the non-Abelian subgroup unbroken at the scale Λ2 , it has to be IR free (or at least conformal).

SU (Nc)i ∼ Λ2.

It was found in [8] that there are two qualitatively diﬀerent branches of vacua. On the baryonic
branch the lower energy gauge group is SU(NF − Nc) × U 2Nc−NF (1), while on non-baryonic branches
these are SU(n1) × U Nc−n1(1), n1 ≤ NF /2.

3

Besides, at m 6= 0, the global ﬂavor symmetry U(NF ) of (1.1) is unbroken or broken spontaneously
as U(NF ) → U(n1) × U(n2), 1 ≤ n1 ≤ [Nf /2] in various vacua [12].
As was also ﬁrst pointed out in [8], there is the residual Z2Nc−NF discrete R-symmetry in theory
(1.1). This symmetry will play a crucial role in what follows, as well as a knowledge of multiplicities
of all diﬀerent types of vacua, see e.g. section 3 in [13] and section 8 in [9]. The charges of ﬁelds
and parameters in the superpotential of (1.1) under Z2Nc−NF = exp{iπ/(2Nc − NF )} transforma-
tion are: qλ = 1, qθ = −1, qX = qm = 2, qQ = q Q = qΛ2 = 0, qµx = −2.
If this nontrivial at
2Nc − NF ≥ 2 discrete Z2Nc−NF symmetry is broken spontaneously in some vacua, there will appear
the factor 2Nc − NF in their multiplicity. Therefore, if multiplicities of diﬀerent types of vacua are
known, we can see explicitly whether this Z2Nc−NF symmetry is broken spontaneously or not in these
vacua. As a result (in the language of [13, 9]), it is seen that the nontrivial discrete Z2Nc−NF ≥2 sym-
metry is broken spontaneously in theory (1.1) at m ≪ Λ2 in L (large) vacua with unbroken U(NF ), in
Lt ( L-type ) vacua with 1 ≤ n1 ≤ NF /2 and in special vacua with n1 = NF − Nc, while it is unbroken
in br2 (br=breaking) vacua with n2 > Nc and in S (small) vacua with unbroken U(NF ), see section 3
in [13].

It was stated in [8] that in all vacua of SU(Nc) (1.1), baryonic and non-baryonic, all light particles
in low energy Lagrangians with m = 0 and small µx, i.e. quarks, gluons and scalars in non-Abelian
sectors and corresponding particles in Abelian ones, are pure magnetic.

Really, the ﬁnal purpose of [8] was an attempt to derive the Seiberg duality for N = 1 SQCD
[14, 15]. The idea was as follows. On the one hand, the electric N = 2 SQCD in (1.1) with small both
µx and m ﬂows clearly to the standard N = 1 electric SQCD with SU(Nc) gauge group, NF ﬂavors
of light quarks and without scalars at m = const, µx → ∞ and ﬁxed Λ3Nc−NF
x . On the
other hand, the authors of [8] expected that, starting in (1.1) at µx ≪ Λ2 from vacua of the baryonic
branch with SU(N c = NF − N) low energy gauge group by itself and increasing then µx ≫ Λ2, they
will obtain Seiberg’s dual N = 1 magnetic SQCD with SU(N c = NF − Nc) gauge group and NF
ﬂavors of massless dual magnetic quarks. (But, in any case, N 2
j → (QjQi)
of dual N = 1 SU(N c) SQCD were missing in this approach, see section 8 in [9] for a more detailed
critique of [8] ).
The results from [8] were generalized then in [12] to nonzero mass quarks, with emphasis on
properties of ﬂavor symmetry breaking in diﬀerent vacua. Besides, multiplicities of various vacua
were discussed in this paper in some details.

simpler examples with small values of Nc and NF , did not conﬁrmed the statement [8] that all these
particles, and in particular light quarks, are pure magnetic.

with the weight-like (i.e.
fundamental) electric charges and the hybrid magnetic charges which are
weight-like with respect to SU(2) but root-like (i.e. adjoint) with respect to SU(3).

i = hD3i ∼ µxΛ2 at µx 6= 0 [17],
all charged pure electric particles with masses ∼ Λ2 are also conﬁned at small µx 6= 0).
Besides, it was demonstrated explicitly in [17, 16] at µx → 0 on examples considered, how vacua
with massless pure electric original quarks Qi at m ≫ Λ2 evolve at m ≪ Λ2 into vacua with only
dyonic massless quarks Di. This is not because at some special value m = m0 ∼ Λ2 the massless
electric quarks mysteriously transform by themselves into massless dyonic quarks. The real mechanism
is diﬀerent and not mysterious.
In the vicinity of m = m0, there is a number of vacua in which
additional corresponding particles become light. At m = m0 all these particles become massless, the

dyonic quarks Di are massless at this point. The masses of quarks with ﬁxed quantum numbers
behave continuously but non-analytically in m/Λ2 at m ≶ m0. E.g., in corresponding vacua, the mass
of light electric quarks Qi stays at zero at µx = 0, m ≥ m0, then begins to grow at m < m0 and
becomes ∼ Λ2 at m ≪ Λ2, while the mass of light composite dyonic quarks Di is zero in these vacua
at m ≤ m0, then begins to grow at m > m0 and becomes large at m ≫ m0.
The examples of these conformal regimes for the SU(2) theory were described earlier in [18, 19, 20]
(but it is clear beforehand in UV free SU(2) with NF = 1, 2, 3 that at m ≪ Λ2 the whole gauge group
is higgsed necessarily at the scale µ ∼ Λ2 by hX adj
SU (2)i ∼ Λ2, SU(2) → U(1) [1, 2], to avoid unphysical
g2(µ < Λ2) < 0, so that all original pure electrically charged particles are indeed heavy, with masses

especially added U (0)(1) multiplet) for general values of Nc, NF and possible forms of low energy

group at µ < Λ2 [8], it was ﬁrst proposed naturally by these authors in [21] that all light charged
particles of N = 2 SU(N c) are the original pure electric particles, as they have not received masses
∼ Λ2 directly from higgsed hX adj
SU (Nc)i (this is forbidden in these vacua by the unbroken nontrivial
Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry [8]). But they changed later their mind to the opposite and, 1 extrapolating
freely by analogy their previous results for r = Nc = 3, NF = 5, n1 = 2 very special vacua in [17] (see
also [23]) to all br2 and very special vacua, stated in [22] that this SU(N c) group is not pure electric but
dyonic. This means that at m ≪ Λ2 all original pure electric particles of this group have received large
masses ∼ Λ2, but now not directly from hX adj
SU (Nc)i ∼ Λ2 (this is forbidden by the nontrivial unbroken
Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry), but from some mysterious ”outside” sources, and decoupled at µ < Λ2, while
the same gauge group SU(N c) of light composite dyonic solitons was formed. Unfortunately, it was
overlooked in [22] that, in distinction with their example with U(Nc = 3), NF = 5, n1 = 2 in [17]
with the trivial Z2Nc−NF =1 symmetry giving no restrictions on the form of hXi, the appearance in the
superpotential at µ ∼ Λ2 of e.g. mass terms of original quarks like ∼ Λ2Tr (QQ)N c ( or ∼ Λ2Tr (QQ)n1 )
is forbidden in vacua with the nontrivial unbroken Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry independently of whether
these terms originated directly from hXi or from unrecognized ”outside”.
The authors of [8] understood that, at m ≪ Λ2, the quarks Qi from SU(N c) can not acquire heavy
masses ∼ Λ2 in vacua with unbroken nontrivial Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry and remain light (i.e. with masses
≪ Λ2). But they argued then that a number of vacua with light pure electric quarks at m ≫ Λ2,
when evolved to m ≪ Λ2, have only light quarks with nonzero magnetic charges. And they considered
this as a literal evidence that phases with light pure electrically and pure magnetically charged quarks
are not diﬀerent and can transform freely into each other by some unidentiﬁed mechanism. And they
supposed that just this mysterious mechanism transformed at m ≪ Λ2 all light pure electric particles
from SU(N c) into light pure magnetic ones. Recall that, as was shown later in [20, 17, 16] and
described above, in vacua with light electric quarks at m ≫ Λ2, these quarks do not literally transform
by themselves into dyonic ones at m ≪ Λ2. The mechanism is diﬀerent, see above. Therefore, we will
consider in what follows that such mysterious mechanism which transforms literally at m ≪ Λ2 light
electric quarks into magnetic ones does not exist really.

2

Our purpose in this paper is similar to [21, 22], but we limit ourselves only to vacua of baryonic
branch with nontrivial unbroken discrete Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry. As will be seen from the text below,
this Z2Nc−NF symmetry is strong enough and helps greatly.

We introduce also two following assumptions of general character :
Assumption A: in considered vacua with nontrivial unbroken Z2Nc−NF ≥2 and at µx → 0, the
original pure electrically charged particles receive additional contributions to their masses only from
higgsed hXi 6= 0 (recall that hXi includes all nonperturbative instanton contributions).
In other
words, at µx → 0 they are BPS particles in vacua considered. For instance, if light quarks Qi with
m ≪ Λ2 do not receive contributions to their masses from some hX Ai 6= 0, they remain as they were,
i.e. the light electric quarks with masses m. The opposite is not true in this very special N = 2
theory in the strong coupling regime g2(µ ∼ Λ2) = O(1). The original pure electric quarks which
have received masses ∼ Λ2 from some hX Ai ∼ Λ2, can combine e.g. with some heavy composite pure
magnetic monopoles, also with masses ∼ Λ2, and form massless composite dyons. And all that.

1 Because not SU (Nc) but U (Nc) group was considered in [21, 22], this their statement concerns really br2 and very
special vacua of U (Nc), see table of contents, sections 2.1.2 and 4 (these are respectively zero vacua and r = Nc vacua
in the language of [21, 22]).

2 It is clear from [21, 22] that these authors also disagree with [8] at this point.

6

Assumption B: there is no massless particles at µx 6= 0, m 6= 0 in considered vacua of the
SU(Nc) theory (1.1) (except for Nambu-Goldstone multiplets originating from spontaneously broken
global U(NF ) → U(n1) × U(n2) ). This assumption will help us to clarify the quantum numbers of
massless at µx → 0 charged dyons Dj, see section 2.1.1 .
Besides, to calculate mass spectra in some N = 1 SQCD theories obtained from N = 2 after
increasing masses µx of scalar multiplets and decoupling them as heavy ones at scales µ < µx, we use
the dynamical scenario introduced in [24]. But it is really needed in this paper only for those cases
with 3Nc/2 < NF < 2Nc when so obtained N = 1 SQCD enters at lower energies the strong coupling
conformal regime with g∗ = O(1), see the text below. Recall that this scenario [24] implies for these
cases that at those even lower scales where this conformal regime is broken by nonzero particle masses,
no additional parametrically light composite solitons are formed in this N = 1 SQCD without scalar
ﬁelds X adj. In other cases, if this N = 1 SQCD stays in the weak coupling regime, its dynamics is
simple and clear and there is no need for any additional dynamical assumptions.

Below in sections 2-5 are presented our results (see the table of contents) for quantum numbers of
light particles, the forms of low energy Lagrangians and mass spectra in various vacua of (1.1) with
the unbroken discrete Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry, at diﬀerent hierarchies between lagrangian parameters
m, µx and Λ2.

For further convenience, we present here also the form of Konishi anomalies [25] in the SU(Nc)
theory (1.1) in vacua with the spontaneously broken global ﬂavor symmetry U(NF ) → U(n1)× U(n2),
see e.g. section 3 in [13] and section 8 in [9], NF = n1 + n2, 1 ≤ n1 ≤ [NF /2], n2 ≥ n1,

in these vacua, the low energy Lagrangians and mass spectra at smallest 0 < µx < ΛSU (N c−n1)
N =2 SY M . The
mass spectra in these br2 vacua at larger values of µx are described in sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4. These

results serve then as a basis for a description of similar regimes below in sections 4 and 5. Besides,
the S vacua with unbroken ﬂavor symmetry (i.e. n1 = 0) are considered in section 2.2.

The light particle quantum numbers, low energy Lagrangians and mass spectra in a number of

vacua of SU(Nc) theory with m ≫ Λ2 are considered in section 3.
Mass spectra in speciﬁc additional vs (very special) vacua with hSiNc = 0, present in U(Nc)
theory (but absent in SU(Nc) one [13] ), are considered in section 4 at m ≶ Λ2 and various values of
0 < µx ≪ Λ2.
U(NF ) → U(n1) × U(n2), n2 < Nc, m ≫ Λ2 at various values of µx.

And ﬁnally, the mass spectra are calculated in section 5 in br2 vacua of SU(Nc) theory with

[21, 22] ) look as, see section 3 in [13] (only leading terms are always given here and everywhere below

We describe ﬁrst the overall qualitative picture of various stages (in order of decreasing energy scale)
of the gauge and ﬂavor symmetry breaking in these br2 vacua. As will be shown below, it leads
in a practically unique way to a right multiplicity of these vacua with unbroken discrete Z2Nc−NF ≥2
symmetry, and it is nontrivial to achieve this.

(2.3)

This pattern of symmetry breaking is required by the unbroken Z2Nc−NF ≥2 discrete symmetry. Recall
that Z2Nc−NF charges are qλ = −qθ = 1, qX = qm = 2, qQ = qΛ2 = 0, µx = −2, so that (2.3)
respects Z2Nc−NF symmetry, while the form (2.2) ensures the right behavior under Z2Nc−NF ≥2 =
exp{iπ/(2Nc − NF )} transformations up to interchanging terms in (2.2) (the Weyl symmetry).
As a result, all original SU(b2) charged electric particles acquire large masses ∼ Λ2 and decouple
at lower energies. But due to strong coupling g(µ ∼ Λ2) ∼ 1, b2 = 2Nc − NF composite light dyons
Dj, Dj (massless at µx → 0) are formed in this sector, this number is required by the unbroken
Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry which operates interchanging them with each other. This is seen also from the
elliptic curve (1.2): it has b2 unequal double roots ej ∼ ω j−1Λ2, j = 1, ..., b2, corresponding to these
b2 dyons [8, 12]. The quantum numbers of these dyons Dj are discussed below in detail. They are
all ﬂavor singlets and have the SU(b2) root-like (i.e. adjoint) magnetic charges which are singlets
with respect to SU(N c)× U (1)(1). Besides, they have nonzero SU(b2) electric baryon charge to which
U (1)(1) is coupled and SU(Nc) electric baryon charge to which ”m” is coupled, see below.
All original electric particles with SU(N c) colors remain light, i.e. with masses ≪ Λ2. This is a
consequence of the nontrivial unbroken Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry and their BPS properties. As for the
quarks with SU(N c) colors, the appearance of the mass term like Λ2Tr (QQ)N c in the superpotential
will break spontaneously Z2Nc−NF ≥2. Therefore, the unbroken Z2Nc−NF ≥2 is suﬃcient by itself to
forbid so large masses. This is clear. But we will need below stronger assumption ”A” formulated
in Introduction that these quarks are BPS particles, i.e.
they receive contributions to their mass
only directly from higgsed hX adj
SU (N ci. This forbids also the appearance of any additional ”outside”
contributions to their masses, e.g. ∼ mTr (QQ)N c, although these are not forbidden by the unbroken
Z2Nc−NF ≥2. Besides, this BPS assumption ”A” concerns all particles of SU(N c).
The SU(N c) gauge symmetry can be still considered as unbroken at scales m ≪ µ ≪ Λ2 (it
, see below). Therefore, at µx ≪ m the

is broken only at the scale ∼ m due to higgsed X adj
superpotential at scales m ≪ µ ≪ Λ2 can be written as

where aD,j are the light neutral dual scalars, L is the Lagrange multiplier, hLi = O(m), all δi = O(1).
The way the parameter ”m” enters (2.4) can be understood as follows. This parameter ”m” in
the original superpotential Wmatter in (1.1) can be considered as a soft scalar U (0)(1) background ﬁeld
coupled universally to the SU(Nc) singlet scalar electric baryon current, δWB = mJB, and this current
looks at the scale µ ≫ Λ2 as JB = Tr (QQ)Nc. But at the lower energy scale µ ≪ Λ2 only lighter
particles with masses ≪ Λ2 and with a nonzero electric baryon charge contribute to JB, these are
j=1 DjDj (see bellow). Moreover, the ﬁeld a1 play a similar role, but its couplings
are diﬀerent for diﬀerent color sectors of SU(Nc), see (2.3).

Tr (QQ)N c andPb2
The terms with δi, i = 1 ... 4 , δi = O(1), arose in (2.4) from integrating out heavy original ﬁelds
with masses ∼ Λ2 in the soft background of X adj
, a1 and (m − c1a1) ﬁelds. These heavy ﬁelds
are : X adj
SU (b2) with masses (Λj − Λi), Λj = ω j−1Λ2, the heavy quarks with SU(b2) colors and masses
Λj + (m−c1a1), and heavy adjoint hybrids with masses Λj + [(1−c1)a1 +√2X adj
]. Note that terms
like Λ2
2, a1Λ2 and (m−c1a1)Λ2 can not appear in (2.4), they are forbidden by the unbroken Z2Nc−NF ≥2
symmetry. Moreover, the pure c-number terms ∼ µxm2 also can not appear in (2.4) as there is no
heavy ﬁelds with masses Λj + m, the soft background ﬁelds include ”m” only in the combination
(m − c1a1). The dots in (2.4) denote parametrically smaller corrections which are neglected.

SU (N c)

SU (N c)

The above described picture is more or less standard, the only nontrivial point concerns the

quantum numbers of b2 dyons Dj. Therefore, we present now additional explanations.

NF

1) First, the SU(N c) part, due its own internal dynamics, ensures ﬁnally the right multiplicity
of vacua, Nbr2 = (N c − n1)C n1
, and the right pattern of the spontaneous ﬂavor symmetry breaking
U(NF ) → U(n1) × U(n2), see below. Therefore, the quantum numbers of these b2 solitons Dj should
be such as not to spoil the right dynamics in the SU(N c) sector.
2) These quantum numbers should be such that the lower energy Lagrangian respects the discrete
Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry. This ﬁxes in particular the number b2 = 2Nc − NF of these solitons because
Z2Nc−NF ≥2 transformation interchanges them between each other.
3) These solitons have to be ﬂavor singlets. Otherwise, their higgsing will result in a wrong pattern

of the spontaneous ﬂavor symmetry breaking.

4) Their magnetic charges should be such that they will be mutually local with respect to all
electric particles in the SU(N c) sector. Otherwise, because all 2Nc − NF these solitons are ﬁnally
higgsed at the larger scale µ ∼ (µxΛ2)1/2 ≫ (µxm)1/2, this will lead to conﬁnement with the string
tension σ ∼ µxΛ2 ≫ µxm of (all or at least a part) electric particles from the SU(N c) sector. These
conﬁned particle from SU(N c) will decouple then as heavy at scales µ < (µxΛ2)1/2 and this will also
spoil the right dynamics in this SU(N c) sector. Therefore, the magnetic charges of these b2 solitons
should be the SU(b2) root-like (i.e. adjoint) charges as these magnetic charges are mutually local
with the whole SU(N c) electric sector. They will couple with U b2−1(1) independent multiplets of dual
photons and scalars aD,j.

5) But the U (1)(1) multiplet (2.3) is SU(b2) singlet and is not coupled with SU(b2) adjoint charges.
Therefore, if these 2Nc − NF solitons Dj will have zero U (1)(1) charge, they will be not coupled with
the U (1)(1) multiplet (2.3) and this will correspond to (2.4) with the ﬁrst term of WD of the form

j=1 DjDj in (2.4),(2.6). This will lead to inconsistency, see below in this section.

mPb2

10

The opposite case, i.e. the ﬁrst term of WD of the form ∼ a1Pb2

j=1 DjDj in (2.4),(2.6) will lead
in section 2.1.2 below to the value of h(QQ)1in1 in disagreement with those obtained in [26] using the
roots of the curve (1.2).
In the magnetic variant of this U (1)(1) nonzero charge of dyons Dj, because they all are higgsed,
the dual U (1)(1) photon will acquire the mass ∼ (µxΛ2)1/2 and this will result in conﬁnement of all
electric quarks Qi from SU(N c) because they are also coupled with this U (1)(1). These quarks Qi will
decouple then as eﬀectively heavy at scales µ < (µxΛ2)1/2 and there will remain N = 2 SU(N c) SYM.
It will give the multiplicity factor N c, so that the overall multiplicity will be N c(N c − n1), while the
ﬂavor symmetry will remain unbroken. This is clearly unacceptable.
Now, about the case when this ﬁrst term of WD in (2.4) equals zero. All b2 dyons are higgsed
at µx 6= 0 (this is a consequence of the unbroken Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry which operates interchanging
them with each other), but there will be only b2 − 1 independent dual U (b2−1)(1) multiplets they
are coupled with. Then there will remain additional massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons resulting at
µx 6= 0 in the additional (inﬁnite) factor in the multiplicity of these vacua. Moreover, counting degrees
of freedom in the SU(N c)× U (1)(1) sector (see below), it is seen that one N = 1 photon multiplet will
remain exactly massless (while its scalar partner will have very small mass ∼ µx only due to breaking
N = 2 to N = 1). At least, all this does not look realistic. According to our assumption ”B” (see
Introduction), this variant with massless particles at µx 6= 0 (in addition to normal Nambu-Goldstone
particles originating from the spontaneous global ﬂavor symmetry breaking) is excluded.
Therefore, these solitons should have nonzero both electric U (1)(1) and SU(Nc) baryon charges,
they will be coupled then in addition with ”m” and with the electric U (1)(1) multiplet (2.3) and there
will be no additional massless particles at µx 6= 0, and the multiplicity and pattern of ﬂavor symmetry
breaking will be right, see below. On the whole, as for the group structures of the U (1)(1) charge and
SU(2Nc − NF ) adjoint magnetic charges of our dyons Dj, Dj, they are the same as in [8], but the
diﬀerence is that the U (1)(1) charge of our dyons is electric while it is magnetic in [8].
The appearance of such dyons Dj can be e.g. thought of as follows. The heavy ﬂavorless solitons
with both electric SU(Nc) baryon and U (1)(1) charges and with the mass ∼ Λ2 combined with corre-
sponding heavy pure magnetic SU(2Nc − NF ) adjoint monopoles, also with masses ∼ Λ2, and formed
2Nc − NF light dyons Dj (massless at µx → 0).

2) The second stage is the breaking SU(N c) → SU(n1) × U (2)(1) × SU(N c − n1) at the lower

scale µ ∼ m, see (2.7),(2.8) below,
U (1) = a2 diag( 1, ...1

√2 X (2)

As a result, all original electric quarks with SU(N c − n1) colors and NF ﬂavors have masses m2 =
hm − a1 − c2a2i ∼ m, while all original electrically charged hybrids SU(N c)/[SU(n1) × SU(N c − n1)]
have masses c2ha2i ∼ m, and so all these particles decouple as heavy at scales µ ≪ m. But the
original electric quarks with SU(n1) colors and NF ﬂavors have masses hm− a1− a2i = 0, they remain
massless at µx → 0 and survive at µ . m. Therefore, there remain two lighter non-Abelian sectors
SU(n1) × SU(N c − n1). As for the ﬁrst one, it is IR free N = 2 SU(n1) SQCD with NF ﬂavors
of original electric quarks massless at µx → 0 , NF > 2n1, n1 < N c . As for the second one, it is

SYM, the ﬁeld X adj
N =2 SY M , breaking N = 2 SU(N c − n1) SYM
in a well known way [3], SU(N c − n1) → U N c−n1−1(1). All original pure electrically charged gluons
and scalars of N = 2 SU(N c − n1) SYM acquire masses ∼ ΛSU (N c−n1)
N =2 SY M and decouple at lower ener-
gies µ < ΛSU (N c−n1)
Instead, N c − n1 − 1 light composite pure magnetic monopoles (massless at
N =2 SY M .
µx → 0) are formed, Mi, M i, i = 1, ..., N c − n1 − 1, with their SU(N c − n1) root-like (i.e. adjoint)
magnetic charges. The factor N c − n1 in the overall multiplicity of considered br2 vacua originates
from the multiplicity of vacua of this N = 2 SU(N c − n1) SYM. Besides, the appearance of two
single roots, e±, (e+ − e−) ∼ ΛSU (N c−n1)
N =2 SY M , of the curve (1.2) in these br2 vacua is connected just with
this N = 2 SU(N c − n1) SYM. Other N c − n1 − 1 roots originating from this N = 2 SYM sector
are unequal double roots corresponding to N c−n1−1 pure magnetic monopoles Mi massless at µx → 0.
4) All 2Nc − NF dyons are higgsed at the scale hDji ∼ (µxΛ2)1/2 and b2 = 2Nc − NF long N = 2
multiplets of massive photons are formed (including 2Nc − NF − 1 magnetic U 2Nc−NF −1(1) and one
electric U (1)(1) with its scalar a1), all with masses ∼ (µxΛ2)1/2. No massless particles remain in this
sector at µx 6= 0. Besides, these higgsed dyons with the SU(2Nc − NF ) root like magnetic charges are
mutually nonlocal with all pure electrically U 2Nc−NF −1(1) charged particles with largest masses ∼ Λ2.
This leads to conﬁnement of all these heaviest electric particles, so that they form a large number of
neutral hadrons with masses ∼ Λ2. But this conﬁnement is weak, in the sense that the tension of the
conﬁning string is much smaller than particle masses, σ1/2 ∼ (µxΛ2)1/2 ≪ Λ2.

5) n1 out of NF electric quarks of SU(n1) are higgsed with hQk

a (µxm)1/2, a = 1, ..., n1, k =
ai ∼ δk
1, ..., NF . As a result, the whole electric group SU(n1) is broken and n2
1 long N = 2 multiplets of
massive electric gluons are formed (including U (2)(1)), all with masses ∼ (µxm)1/2 ≪ (µxΛ2)1/2. The
global ﬂavor symmetry is broken spontaneously at this stage, U(NF ) → U(n1) × U(n2) and 2n1n2
a
massless Nambu-Goldstone multiplets are formed in this sector (in essence, these are Qk
k , a =
1, ..., n1, k = n1 + 1, ..., NF quarks). This is a reason for the origin of the factor C n1
in multiplicity
NF
of these br2 vacua. No additional massless particles remain in this sector at µx 6= 0.

a, Q

6) N c − n1 − 1 magnetic monopoles are higgsed at the lowest scale, hMii ∼ (µxΛSU (N c−n1)

N =2 SY M )1/2 ≪
(µxm)1/2, and N c − n1 − 1 long N = 2 multiplets of massive magnetic U N c−n1−1(1) photons are
formed, all with masses ∼ (µxΛSU (N c−n1)
N =2 SY M )1/2. All pure electrically charged particles with nonzero
SU(N c − n1) charges and masses either ∼ m or ∼ ΛSU (N c−n1)
N =2 SY M will be weakly conﬁned, the string
tension is σ1/2

N =2 SY M )1/2. Also, no massless particles remain in this sector at µx 6= 0.

It is worth to recall that at small µx → 0 the N = 2 SUSY remains unbroken at the level of particle
masses O(√µx), and only small corrections O(µx) to masses of scalar superﬁelds X break N = 2 to
N = 1.

The whole spectrum of masses in the br2 vacua considered and, in particular, the spectrum of
nonzero masses arising from (2.6) at small 0 < µx ≪ ΛSU (N c−n1)
N =2 SY M was described above in this section.
It is in accordance with Nc − 1 double roots of the curve (1.2) in these br2-vacua at µx → 0. Of them:
2Nc − NF unequal roots corresponding to 2Nc − NF dyons Dj, then n1 equal roots corresponding
to n1 pure electric quarks Qk of SU(n1) (higgsed at µx 6= 0), and ﬁnally N c − n1 − 1 unequal roots
corresponding to N c − n1 − 1 pure magnetic monopoles Mi of SU(N c − n1 − 1) N = 2 SYM. Recall
that two single roots e± with (e+ − e−) ∼ ΛSU (N c−n1)
N =2 SY M of the curve (1.2) originate in these br2 vacua
from the N = 2 SU(N c − n1) SYM sector.
As it is seen from the above, the only exactly massless at m 6= 0, µx 6= 0 particles in the Lagrangian
(2.6) are 2n1n2 Nambu-Goldstone multiplets originating from the spontaneous breaking of the global
ﬂavor symmetry.

2.1.2 U(Nc) , small µx , µx ≪ ΛSU (N c−n1)
U(Nc) theory is obtained by adding one SU(Nc) singlet U (0)(1) N = 2 multiplet, with its scalar ﬁeld
√2X (0) = a0I, where I is the unit Nc × Nc matrix. Instead of (1.1), the superpotential looks now as

and we consider here only the case with µ0 = µx. The only change in the Konishi anomalies (1.3) and
in the value of h(QQ)2iNc in (2.1) will be that now

h(QQ)1 + (QQ)2iNc = µxm ≃ h(QQ)2iNc ,

(2.16)

while in br2 vacua the small ratio h(QQ)1iNc/h(QQ)2iNc ≪ 1 and small hSiNc ≪ µxm2 in (2.1) remain
parametrically the same. Besides, from (2.15) (neglecting as always small power corrections),

It is not diﬃcult to check that values of δ1,2 obtained from (2.19)=(2.20) are the same as in (2.12). 3

Therefore, ﬁnally, instead of (2.13), we obtain now

As a check, we can compare these values with those obtained in [26] using roots of the elliptic

curve (1.2)

Finally, in short in this U(Nc) theory about the variant of (2.6) with the ﬁrst term of WD of
j=1 DjDj, i.e. with zero U (0)(1) baryon charge of dyons Dj. With such a WD term
in (2.6) (with added a0), this will result in ha1i = 0, ha2i = hm − a0i = −m (N c − n1)/Nc and

and this disagrees with h(QQ)1in1 = µxm from [26], see above.

It is worth to recall that the number of double roots of the curve (1.2) in this case is still Nc − 1,
as two single roots e±, (e+ − e−) ∼ ΛSU (N c−n1)
N =2 SY M , still originate from SU(N c − n1) N = 2 SYM. In
other words, the number of charged higgsed particles remains Nc − 1 as in the SU(Nc) theory, i.e. :
2Nc − NF dyons Dj, N c − n1 − 1 pure magnetic monopoles Mi and n1 electric quarks Qk. But now, in
comparison with the SU(Nc) theory, one extra U (0)(1) multiplet is added. As a result, in addition to
2n1n2 massless Nambu-Goldstone multiplets, there remains now one exactly massless N = 1 photon
multiplet, while its partner scalar N = 1 multiplet has smallest nonzero mass ∼ µx due to breaking
N = 2 → N = 1.

3 Besides, one can check that (2.6) with added a0 in this U (Nc) theory, but with all δi = 0, i = 1...4, will result in

the wrong value: ha0i = [ m (b2 + n1)/Nc ], this diﬀers from (2.17).

The case with m ≪ µx ≪ Λ2 and Nc + 1 < NF < 3Nc/2 is described in section 8.1 of [9]. Therefore,
we consider here in addition the region 3Nc/2 < NF < 2Nc − 1.
Recall, that the whole dyonic b2 = 2Nc − NF sector, including the U (1)(1) N = 2 photon multiplet
with its scalar partner a1, acquire masses ∼ (µxΛ2)1/2 ≫ µx and decouples at lower energies. But
ﬁnally, the trace of the scalar a1 remains in the lower energy WSU (N c) superpotential at scales µ <

Therefore, the lower energy superpotential at the scale µ = (µxΛ2)1/2 looks as, see (8.1.3),(8.1.6)

(µxΛ2)1/2, µx ≪ (µxΛ2)1/2 ≪ Λ2, in the form: m → em = (m − ha1i) = mNc/N c . Besides, see

the weak coupling region. As a result, the mass spectrum will be the same as in ”a1” above (up to
diﬀerent logarithmic factors).

And only now we use for the ﬁrst time the assumed dynamical scenario from [24] to calculate the
mass spectrum. Really, what is only assumed in this scenario in the case of the standard N = 1 SQCD
conformal regime is the following.
In this N = 1 theory without colored scalars, unlike the very special N = 2 theory with its
additional colored scalar ﬁelds X adj and enhanced supersymmetry, no parametrically lighter solitons
(in addition to the ordinary mass spectrum described below) are formed at those scales where the
standard N = 1 conformal regime is broken by nonzero particle masses. 5

2.2 SU (Nc) , unbroken ﬂavor symmetry U (NF ), S-vacua

As in the br2 vacua in section 2.1, the nontrivial discrete Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry is also unbroken in
these vacua with the multiplicity N c , i.e. they also belong to the baryonic branch in the language
[8], this case corresponds to n1 = 0. The quark condensates hQQiNc in these vacua look as, see e.g.

The diﬀerence is in the behavior of the SU(N c) part. In these vacua with n1 = 0, there is no
analog of the additional gauge symmetry breaking SU(N c) → SU(n1)× U (2)(1)× SU(N c − n1) in br2

N =2 SY M in (3.3) and hai = m in (3.2) have
the same charge 2 under the discrete Z2Nc−NF transformations as X itself, this is due to unbroken
Z2Nc−NF symmetry). There are Nc−n1 physically equivalent vacua and Nc−n1−1 light pure magnetic
monopoles M n, Mn, n = 1...Nc − n1 − 1 with SU(Nc − n1) root-like (i.e. adjoint) charges (massless

compare with (3.1). On the whole, all this results in the right multiplicity of these br1 vacua, Nbr1 =
(Nc − n1)C n1
is due to the
spontaneous breaking U(NF ) → U(n1) × U(n2) by n1 higgsed quarks in the SU(n1) × U(1) sector.
It is worth emphasizing that the value hai = m is exact (i.e. there is no any small correction).
This is seen from the following. At very small µx → 0, the potentially possible correction δm 6= 0 is
b
independent of µx, and so δm ≫ µx. Then quarks Qi
i , i = 1...NF , b = 1...n1 will acquire masses
δm, much larger than the scale of their possible coherent condensate, δm ≫ (µxm)1/2, µx → 0. In
this case these quarks will be not higgsed but will decouple as heavy ones at scales µ < δm and
the ﬂavor symmetry will remain unbroken. There will remain N = 2 SU(n1) × U(1) SYM at scales
µ < δm. This lowest energy N = 2 SU(n1) SYM will give then its own multiplicity factor n1, so that
the overall multiplicity of vacua will be n1(Nc − n1), while the right multiplicity is (Nc − n1)C n1
, see
(3.1) and section 3 in [13]. To have this right multiplicity and spontaneous ﬂavor symmetry breaking
all n1 quarks in (3.5) have to be higgsed at arbitrary small µx, and this is only possible when they are
exactly massless at µx = 0, i.e. at δm = 0.

On the whole, the hierarchies of nonzero masses look in this case as

The situation with SU(Nc − n1) SYM in (3.3),(3.4) is diﬀerent. At ΛSU (Nc−n1)

where n = 1...Nc − n1 − 1 , i = 1...n1 . There are no massless particles, except for the 2n1n2 Nambu-
Goldstone multiplets.
The curve (1.2) has Nc − 1 double roots in these vacua. Nc − n1 − 1 unequal roots corresponds to
pure magnetic monopoles Mn in (3.4) and n1 equal ones to higgsed quarks from SU(n1). Two single
roots e± with (e+ − e−) ∼ ΛSU (Nc−n1)
3.1.2 SU(Nc), larger µx , ΛSU (Nc−n1)
Nothing changes signiﬁcantly in this case with the SU(n1) × U(1) part in (3.5). The mean value
hai = m ≫ µx of the ﬁeld h√2 XU (1)i in (3.2) stays intact as far as µx ≪ m, and so the contributions
∼ √µxm to the masses of n2
1 − 1 long N = 2 SU(n1) multiplets of massive gluons and to the mass of
the long N = 2 U(1) multiplet of the massive photon due to higgsing of n1 quarks remain dominant.
At this level the N = 2 SUSY remains unbroken in this sector. But the N = 2 SUSY breaks down
to N = 1 at the level ∼ µx by the additional smaller contributions ∼ µx ≪ √µxm to the masses of
scalar multiplets.
N =2 SY M ≪ µx ≪ m, the
adjoint scalars X adj
SU (Nc−n1) of the SU(Nc− n1) subgroup in (3.3) become too heavy. Their SU(Nc− n1)
phases ﬂuctuate then freely at the scale ∼ µx so that they are not higgsed now, hX adj
SU (Nc−n1)i = 0.
Instead, they decouple as heavy at µ < µx and can all be integrated out. There remains then at
µ < µx N = 1 SYM with the scale factor ΛSU (Nc−n1)

There is now a large number of strongly coupled colorless gluonia with the mass scale ∼ ΛSU (Nc−n1)
N =1 SY M in
this N = 1 SYM. The multiplicity of vacua remains equal Nc − n1 as it should be. All heavier original
electric particles with masses ∼ m charged with respect to SU(Nc − n1) remain weakly conﬁned, but
the string tension is larger now, √σN =2 ≪ √σN =1 ∼ ΛSU (Nc−n1)

The qualitative diﬀerence with section 3.1 is that one extra N = 1 photon multiplet remains

due to higgsing of n1 = N c original electric quarks in the SU(N c) sector, h(QQ)1iN c ∼ (µxm)1/2, and
spontaneous breaking U(NF ) → U(N c)×U(2Nc−NF ). Two single roots e±, (e+−e−) ∼ ΛSU (2Nc−NF )
of the curve (2.1) at small µx originate from the N = 2 SU(2Nc − NF ) SYM. There is no massless

vacua with hSiNc = 0 are absent in the SU(Nc) theory with m 6= 0, µx 6= 0, see e.g. [13].

Finally, let us compare global symmetries of two regimes, those in section 4.1 and here.

It is
SU(Nc)C+F × SU(N c) × U(1) in section 4.1, where ”C+F” denotes the color-ﬂavor locking. The
higgsed massive electric quarks Qi
i , a, i = 1...Nc, with masses mQ ∼ (µxm)1/2 ≫ Λ2, together
with massive electric SU(Nc) gauge bosons form long N = 2 multiplet in the adjoint representation
of SU(Nc)C+F . The global symmetry in this section is SU(N c)C+F × SU(Nc) × U(1), and higgsed
massive electric quarks Qi
i , a, i = 1...N c, with masses mQ ∼ (µxm)1/2 ≪ Λ2, together with
SU(N c) gauge bosons form the long N = 2 multiplet in the adjoint representation of SU(N c)C+F
(see the point ”3” just above). The diﬀerence of adjoint representations at µxm ≷ Λ2

in [22] as an evidence that all SU(N c) particles cannot be the same original pure electric quarks and

gauge bosons and, by analogy with [17], it was claimed that they are all dyons with nonzero magnetic
charges. As it is seen from the above, this line of reasonings is not right. The reason for diﬀerent
adjoint representations is that the regime and mass spectrum are determined by Nc higgsed quarks
SU (2Nc−NF ) and N c quarks at µxm ≪ Λ2
at µxm ≫ Λ2
(both regimes in section 4.1 and here at m ≫ Λ2, and the case µx ≪ m ≪ Λ2 clearly corresponds to
the regime µxm < Λ2

The pattern of ﬂavor symmetry breaking remains ﬁxed, n1 = N c = Nc − 1 , n2 = Nc , U(NF ) →
U(n1) × U(n2), as well as the multiplicity Nvs = C n2=Nc
. And ha0i = m also remains
the same in all vs -vacua (really, at all m ≷ Λ2) and still ”eats” all quark masses ”m”. But the
discrete symmetry Z2Nc−NF becomes trivial at 2Nc − NF = 1 and gives no restrictions on the form of
hX adj
2 to avoid g2(µ < Λ2) <
0 ). As above in section 4.2, the right ﬂavor symmetry breaking implies the unbroken SU(N c) lower
energy group and a presence of NF ﬂavors of quark-like particles massless at µx → 0, then n1 = N c
of them will be higgsed at small µx 6= 0.
However, it is not diﬃcult to see that a literal picture with light BPS original electric particles of
remained unbroken at the scale µ ∼ Λ2 electric subgroup SU(N c) can not be right at 2Nc − NF = 1.
Indeed, if this were the case, then hX adj
SU (Nc)i ∼ Λ2 diag( 1, ..., 1 ; −N c ), N c = Nc − 1. But all quarks
Qi, Qi with SU(Nc) colors will acquire then masses ∼ Λ2 and decouple at µ . Λ2. The remained
N = 2 SU(N c) SYM with the scale factor ∼ Λ2 of its gauge coupling is not IR free and, to avoid
unphysical g2(µ . Λ2) < 0, it will be necessarily higgsed as hX adj
SU (N c)i ∼ Λ2, SU(N c) → U N c−1(1), in
contradiction with the assumption that it remains unbroken at µ . Λ2. 9

SU (Nc)i ∼ Λ2 is higgsed necessarily at µxm ≪ Λ2

Therefore, the vs -vacua with 2Nc − NF = 1 are really exceptional, they are not typical vacua.
The absence of the nontrivial unbroken Z2Nc−NF symmetry is crucial. 10 The possible exceptional
properties of vacua with 2Nc − NF = 1 at µx → 0 are indicated also by the curve (1.2), its form is
changed at 2Nc − NF = 1 : m → m + (Λ2/Nc) [8].

For this reason we do not deal with such vacua in this paper.

4.4 m ≪ Λ2
Comparing with the case µx ≪ Λ2, m ≫ Λ2 in sections 4.2, 4.3, the case µx ≪ m ≪ Λ2, cor-
responds clearly only the regime (µxm)1/2 ≪ Λ2.
In section 4.2, the diﬀerence with the case
m ≫ Λ2, (µxm)1/2 ≪ Λ2 is only quantitative, not qualitative, see (4.8). The main diﬀerence is
that hDji ∼ (µxm)1/2 ≫ (µxΛ2)1/2 at m ≫ Λ2, while hDji ∼ (µxΛ2)1/2 ≫ (µxm)1/2 at m ≪ Λ2. Still,
there is no particles with masses ∼ m, the only particle masses independent of µx are ∼ Λ2.

9 Clearly, at m ≪ Λ2, µx → 0 and 2Nc − NF = 1, this argument concerns also SU (Nc) br2 vacua with 0 < n1 < N c
and S vacua with n1 = 0, both with hSiNc 6= 0 and with the SU (N c = Nc − 1) gauge group at lower energy µ < Λ2.
10 Considered in [17] example of U (Nc) vs -vacua (r = Nc vacua in the language of [17]) with Nc = 3, NF = 5, n1 =
N c = Nc − 1 = 2 and hSiNc = 0 belongs just to this exceptional type of vs -vacua with 2Nc − NF = 1.

n1 ↔ n2, see sections 3 and 11 in [13]. The discrete Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry is also unbroken in these
vacua. Similarly to br1 vacua, the scalars X are also higgsed at the largest scale µ ∼ m ≫ Λ2 in the

N =2 SY M , Nc−n2−1 pure magnetic monopoles Mn with the SU(Nc−n2)
root-like (i.e. adjoint) charges are formed (massless at µx → 0) in this SYM sector. This corresponds

two single roots e±, (e+ − e−) ∼ ΛSU (Nc)
N =2 SY M of the curve (1.2) also originate from this SYM sector.
Other n2 double roots of the curve originate in these vacua from the SU(n2) sector, see below.

These Nc − n2 − 1 monopoles are all higgsed with hMni ∼ (µxΛSU (Nc−n2)

long N = 2 multiplets of massive photons appear, with masses ∼ (µxΛSU (Nc−n2)

Therefore, there will be in this case a large number of strongly coupled SU(Nc − n2) gluonia with
the mass scale ∼ ΛSU (Nc−n2)

either ∼ m ≫ ΛSU (Nc−n2)

Note that the value of ∼ ΛSU (n2) in (5.6) is also consistent with the unbroken Z2Nc−NF discrete

What qualitatively diﬀers this SU(n2) part in br2 vacua at scales µ < m from its analog SU(n1)
in br1 vacua is that SU(n1) with NF > 2n1 is IR free, while SU(n2) with NF < 2n2 is UV free, so
that its small N = 2 gauge coupling at the scale µ ∼ m ≫ Λ2 begins to grow logarithmically with
diminished energy at µ < m. Therefore, if nothing prevents, X adj
SU (n2) will be higgsed necessarily at
the scale ∼ ΛSU (n2), with hX adj

But if (µxm)1/2 ≫ ΛSU (n2), the phase will be diﬀerent. The leading eﬀect in this case will be the
breaking of the whole SU(n2) group due to higgsing of n2 < Nc out of NF quarks Qi, Qi in the weak
coupling region, with hQi

5.2 Smaller µx
Consider now the behavior of the SU(n2) × U (1)(1) part in the opposite case (µxm)1/2 ≪ ΛSU (n2),
ΛSU (n2) ≪ Λ2 ≪ m. As will be seen below, in this case even all qualitative properties of mass
spectra in this part will be quite diﬀerent (the behavior of the SU(Nc − n2) SYM part decoupled from
SU(n2) × U (1)(1) was described above in section 5.1).
SU (n2) is higgsed ﬁrst at the scale ∼ ΛSU (n2)
to avoid unphysical g2(µ < ΛSU (n2)) < 0 of UV free N = 2 SU(n2). Although ΛSU (n2) respects the
original Z2Nc−NF discrete symmetry of the UV free SU(Nc) theory, see (5.6), because the SU(Nc − n2)
SYM part is now decoupled, there is the analog of Z2Nc−NF in the SU(n2) group with NF ﬂavors
of quarks, this is the unbroken nontrivial Z2n2−NF = Zn2−n1 discrete symmetry with n2 − n1 ≥ 2.
Therefore, the ﬁeld X adj
SU (n2) is higgsed at n2 − n1 ≥ 2 qualitatively similarly to (2.2),(2.3) in section
2.1.1 : SU(n2) → SU(n1)×U (2)(1)×U n2−n1−1(1). There will be similar dyons Dj (massless at µx → 0)
etc., and a whole qualitative picture will be similar to those in section 2.1.1, with evident replacements
of parameters. The only qualitative diﬀerence is that the additional SYM part is absent here because
n1 quark ﬂavors are higgsed now in SU(n1),

Note also that if the nontrivial discrete symmetry Zn2−n1≥2 were broken spontaneously in the

in the multiplicity of these vacua, and this is a wrong factor.

gluons with masses ∼ (µxm)1/2, while quarks with n2 ﬂavors and SU(n1) colors form 2n1n2 massless

Recall that the curve (1.2) has Nc − 1 double roots in these br2 vacua. Of them, n2 − n1 unequal
roots correspond to n2 − n1 dyons Dj, n1 equal roots correspond to n1 higgsed quarks Qi of SU(n1),
the remaining unequal Nc − n2 − 1 double roots correspond to Nc − n2 − 1 pure magnetic monopoles

6 Conclusions

We presented above in this paper the calculations of mass spectra of softly broken N = 2 SU(Nc)
(or U(Nc)) gauge theories in a number of their various vacua with the unbroken nontrivial Z2Nc−NF ≥2
discrete symmetry. The quantum numbers of light particles in each vacuum were determined, as well
as forms of corresponding low energy Lagrangians and mass spectra at diﬀerent hierarchies between
the Lagrangian parameters m, µx, Λ2. The crucial role in obtaining these results was played by the
use : a) the unbroken nontrivial Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry, b) the pattern of spontaneous ﬂavor symmetry
breaking, U(NF ) → U(n1) × U(n2), 0 ≤ n1 < NF /2, c) the knowledge of multiplicities of various
vacua. In addition, the two assumptions ”A” and ”B” of general character formulated in Introduction
were used. All this appeared to be suﬃcient to calculate mass spectra in vacua considered at small
but nonzero values of µx, i.e. 0 < µx < Mmin, where Mmin is the independent of µx minimal nonzero
particle mass in a given vacua.

min = ΛSU (N c−n1)

Within this framework we considered ﬁrst in detail in section 2.1.1 the br2 vacua of SU(Nc)
theory (these are vacua of the baryonic branch in [8] or zero vacua in [21, 22]) at m ≪ Λ2 and
0 < µx ≪ M (br2)
N =2 SY M ≪ m ≪ Λ2. The ﬂavor symmetry is broken spontaneously in these
vacua at µx 6= 0 as : U(NF ) → U(n1) × U(n2), 1 ≤ n1 < N c = NF − Nc , while the nontrivial
Z2Nc−NF ≥2 discrete symmetry is unbroken. The original color symmetry is broken spontaneously at
the scale µ ∼ Λ2 as : SU(Nc) → SU(NF − Nc) × U (1)(1) × U 2Nc−NF −1(1), this pattern is required by
the unbroken discrete Z2Nc−NF ≥2 symmetry.
It was shown that the lightest charged particles (massless at µx → 0) are : 1) 2Nc − NF ﬂavorless
dyons Dj, Dj (this number 2Nc − NF is required by the unbroken Z2Nc−NF ≥2 discrete symmetry which
operates interchanging them with each other), with the two nonzero electric charges, the SU(Nc)
baryon charge and U (1)(1) one, and with 2Nc − NF − 1 independent SU(2Nc − NF ) root-like (i.e.
adjoint) magnetic charges ; 2) all original electric particles of remaining unbroken at µx → 0 SU(n1)
subgroup of original SU(Nc) ; 3) N c − n1 − 1 pure magnetic monopoles with SU(N c − n1) root-like
magnetic charges (these originated from N = 2 SU(N c − n1) SYM with the scale factor ΛSU (N c−n1)
In addition, there are Nc − 1 Abelian N = 2 photon multiplets massless
of its gauge coupling).
at µx → 0. Massless at µx = 0 2Nc − NF dyons Dj, n1 pure electric quarks from SU(n1) and
N c − n1 − 1 pure magnetic monopoles are all higgsed at small µx 6= 0 and no massless particles
remains (except for 2n1n1 Nambu-Goldstone multiplets due to spontaneous breaking of global ﬂavor
symmetry, U(NF ) → U(n1) × U(n2)). The mass spectrum was described in these br2 vacua at
0 < µx ≪ ΛSU (N c−n1)
N =2 SY M ≪ m ≪ Λ2. The material of this section 2.1.1 served then as a basis for similar
regimes in sections 2, 4 and 5.
N =2 SY M ≪ µx ≪

The mass parameter µx was increased then in two diﬀerent stages : 1) ΛSU (N c−n1)

m , 2) m ≪ µx ≪ Λ2, and changes in the mass spectra were described. In all those cases when the
corresponding N = 1 SQCD lower energy theories were weakly coupled, we needed no additional
dynamical assumptions. And only in those few cases when the corresponding N = 1 SQCD theories
were in the strongly coupled conformal regime at 3Nc/2 < NF < 2Nc, we used additionally the
assumption of the dynamical scenario introduced in [24]. In essence, this assumption from [24] looks
here as follows : no additional parametrically light composite solitons are formed in this N = 1 SQCD
without colored adjoint scalars X adj at those lower scales where this conformal regime is broken by
nonzero particle masses (see also the footnote 5). As was shown in [24, 27, 9], this assumption does
not contradict to any proven properties of N = 1 SQCD and allows to calculate the corresponding
mass spectra.
Many other vacua with the broken or unbroken ﬂavor symmetry and at diﬀerent hierarchies between
the Lagrangian parameters m, µx, Λ2 were considered and corresponding mass spectra calculated
within the above described framework. We consider that there is no need to repeat here in detail a
whole context of the paper.

Clearly, this article does not pretend on strict proofs as a few additional dynamical assumptions of
general character were used. But, to the best of our knowledge, the results obtained look self-consistent
and do not contradict to any proven results.

In comparison with corresponding results from both recent related papers [21, 22] of M. Shifman
and A. Yung, our results are diﬀerent. In addition to critical remarks given in Introduction and in
section 4.3, an extended criticism of a number of results from [21, 22] is given in section 8 of [9],v4.
