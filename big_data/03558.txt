CONTROLLED VIRTUAL VOLUME REPRESENTATIONS

AND EFFICIENT VIRTUAL DOMINATIONS

PIERRE DERBEZ, YI LIU, HONGBIN SUN, AND SHICHENG WANG

Abstract. We show that for any close orientable 3–manifold with non-vanish
simplicial volume, the growth of the Seifert volume (representation volume to
^SL2(R)) of its ﬁnite covers is faster than the linear rate. In particular each
Isoe
closed oriented 3-manifold with positive simplicial volume has virtually positive
Seifert volume, which strengthens the signiﬁcance of the Seifert volume.

The proof is based on reactions and further developments (as indicated in
the title) of recent results on virtual representation volumes [DLW] and on
virtual domination [Sun] of 3-manifolds.

1. Introduction

The volume of representations of 3-manifolds groups is a beautiful theory, and it
has rich connections with many branches of mathematics. However, the behavior
of those volume functions seems still quite mysterious.

To make our statement make more sense, we ﬁrst give some basic notions (which
will be deﬁned later) and properties of volume of representations. Let G be either
Iso+H3 ∼= PSL(2; C), the orientation preserving isometry group of the hyperbolic
^SL2(R) ∼= R ×Z ^SL2(R), the identity component of the isometry
3-space, or Isoe
group of ^SL2(R). For any closed orientable 3-manifold M , and each representation
ρ : π1M → G, the volume of ρ is denoted by volG(M, ρ). Then we deﬁne

vol (M, G) = sup {volG(M, ρ)| ρ runs over all the representations π1M → G} .
Suppose M supports the hyperbolic geometry, respectively the ^SL2(R)-geometry,
then M naturally has its own hyperbolic volume volH3 (M ), respectively Seifert
volume vol ^SL2(R)
(M ). The following theorem contains some known basic results of
the theory of representation volumes. For its development, see [BG1] ,[BG2], [Re]
and their references.

Theorem 1.1. Let N be a closed orientable 3-manifold.

(1) Both vol(N, PSL(2; C)) and vol(N, Isoe

^SL2(R)) contain at most ﬁnitely
many values. So the supremums HV(N ) and SV(N ) of vol(N, PSL(2; C))
and vol(N, Isoe

^SL2(R)) are reached.

(2) If N admits a hyperbolic geometric structure, then HV(N ) equals volH3 (N ),
reached by any discrete and faithful representation. A similar statement
holds when N admits an ^SL2(R) geometric structure.

(3) HV(N ) ≤ µ3 ||N ||, where µ3 is the volume of any ideal regular tetrahedron

in H3 and || · || denotes the simplicial volume.

(4) Let f : M → N be a map between closed orientable 3-manifolds and let

ρ : π1N → G be a representation. Then

volG(M, f ∗ρ) = deg(f ) volG(N, ρ).

Hence

HV(M ) ≥ |degf | HV(N ) and SV(M ) ≥ |degf | SV(N ).

We call HV(N ) and SV(N ) in the conclusion of Theorem 1.1 (1) the hyperbolic

volume and the Seifert volume of N , respectively.

Since a prime factor of a closed oriented 3-manifold M has positive representation
volume implies that M also has positive representation volume (with respect to the
same Lie group G), so we will be only interested in prime manifolds.

Remark 1.2. Let M and N be two closed oriented 3-manifolds and let D(M, N )
be the set of degrees of maps from M to N . and denote D(N, N ) by D(N ). From
Theorem 1.1 we have if D(N ) (or D(M, N ) for some M ) is inﬁnite, SV(N ) =
HV(N ) = 0.

Theorem 1.1 and Remark 1.2 provide important information of SV(N ) and
HV(N ) about some 3-manifolds. However, beyond the scope of those results, as we
will see soon, it is still hard to tell whether a 3-manifold M has non-zero SV(M)
and HV(M ).

Motivated by the study of the ﬁniteness of D(M, N ) for graph manifolds N , the
following question was raised [DW1]: whether each non-trivial graph manifold N
admits a ﬁnite cover ˜N with positive SV ( ˜N ), and the aﬃrmative answer is obtained
in [DW2]. Further systematical study of virtual positive volume is carried in [DLW],

VIRTUAL REPRESENTATION VOLUME AND VIRTUAL DOMINATION

by employing Chern-Simon Theory for computation and the recent work of wise
and his co-authors on surfaces in 3-manifolds for constructing ﬁnite covers.

Theorem 1.3. ([DLW, Theorem 1.6 and Theorem 1.7])

(1) Suppose that M is a closed oriented irreducible non-geometric 3-manifold. If
M contains at least one hyperbolic geometric piece (resp. Seifert geometric piece),
then the hyperbolic volume (resp.
positive.

the Seifert volume) of some ﬁnite cover fM is

(2) There are closed oriented non-geometric 3-manifolds containing a hyperbolic
geometric piece (resp. Seifert geometric piece) with vanishing hyperbolic volume
(resp. Seifert volume).

Two further problems below were also posed in the end of [DLW].
Theorem 1.3 (1) states that, if a closed oriented irreducible 3-manifold has a non-
trivial geometric decomposition, then it has vitually positive representation volume
with respect to the corresponding geometries of its JSJ-pieces. Recall that the sim-
plicial volume ||M || of a closed oriented 3-manifold M is positive if and only if M
contains a hyperbolic JSJ-piece. Since the hyperbolic volume of a closed 3-manifold
is bounded above by its simplicial volume according to Theorem 1.1 (3), Theorem
1.3 gives the complete answer for the virtual positiveness of the hyperbolic vol-
ume: a closed 3-manifold has virtually positive hyperbolic volume if and only if its
simplicial volume is positive.

Problem 1.4. ([DLW, Question 8.2]) Is the Seifert volume of a closed prime 3-
manifold virtually positive if it has positive simplicial volume?

This question is open for the case that the 3-manifold has only hyperbolic pieces

in its geometric decomposition.

Recall some deﬁnitions: Suppose both M and N are closed orientable 3-
manifolds, we say M (virtually) dominates N if there is a map of non-zero degree
from M (a ﬁnite cover of M ) to N . A non-negative invariant η of 3-manifolds
is said to satisfy the domination property if for any map f : M → N we have
η(M ) ≥ |deg(p)|η(N ), and satisfy the covering property if for any ﬁnite covering

p : eN → N , we have η(eN ) = |deg(p)|η(N ). Both SV and HV have the domina-

tion property by Theorem 1.1 (4). An immediate corollary of Theorem 1.3 is that
neither the hyperbolic volume nor the Seifert volume have the covering property.
Covering property will be addresses again in Section 6.

For the approach of [DLW], it seems that we are not able to control the degree
of the cover that we need to pass to, so we do not have lower bound estimations
of the growth of virtual volumes of representations. Since the hyperbolic volume is
bounded by the simplicial volume, it has at most linear growth as HV( ˜M ) / [ ˜M : M ]
is bounded by µ3||M ||. However, we do not know whether the Seifert volume has
at most linear growth as well.

Problem 1.5. ([DLW, Question 8.1]) Estimate the growth of virtual hyperbolic
volume and virtual Seifert volume.

Our ﬁrst result in this note is the positive answer for Question 1.4. Soon after
the presence of [DLW], the following result appeared in [Sun], which answered an
open question of I. Agol, and whose proof used recent works of immersed surfaces
in hyperbolic 3-manifolds in [KM] and [LM], as well as Agol’s [Ag] and Wise’s [Wi]
work on the groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

Theorem 1.6 ([Sun]). For any closed oriented hyperbolic 3-manifold M , and any

closed oriented 3-manifold N , M admits a ﬁnite cover fM , such that there exists a
π1-surjective degree-2 map f : fM → N .

Then the positive answer for Question 1.4 for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds fol-
lows, by taking N to be any closed oriented 3-manifold with the ^SL2(R)-geometry.
So it remains to answer Question 1.4 for prime 3-manifolds which have nontrivial
JSJ-decomposition, such that each JSJ-piece is a hyperbolic manifold with ﬁnite
volume. We will combine Theorem 1.6 and the frame work designed in [DLW] to
prove the following result, which conﬁrms Question 1.4.

Theorem 1.7. Suppose M is a closed orientable 3-manifold with positive simplicial

volume, then there is a ﬁnite cover fM of M with positive Seifert volume.

In the geometric aspect of 3-manifold theory, simplicial volume is a very useful
and important invariant, and Seifert volume usually is considered as a supplement of
simplicial volume. Since simplicial volume has covering property, and a 3-manifold
has virtual non-vanishing simplicail volume if and only if its JSJ decomposition
contains at least one hyperbolic piece. Theorem 1.7 pointed out that, from the
virtual point of view, the positivity of Seifert volume is more general than that
of simplicial volume for 3-manifolds. Theorem 1.7 will strengthens the topological
signiﬁcance of the Seifert volume, and one of such example is given below.

It is known that (e.g. see [DSW]), for a closed orientable 3-manifold N , D(M, N )
is a ﬁnite set for any closed orientable 3-manifold M , if and only if N contains a
prime factor Q such that either Q has non-trivial geometric decomposition, or Q
supports the Seifert geometry, or Q supports the hyperbolic geometry.

By Theorem 1.7 and results in [DW2], [DSW] and [DLW], we have the following

result.

Theorem 1.8. Suppose N is a closed orientable 3-manifold, then the following
three statements are equivalent.

(i) D(M, N ) is ﬁnite for any closed orientable 3-manifold M .
(ii) N has virtually positive Seifert volume.
(iii) N contains a prime factor Q, such that either Q has non-trivial geometric
decomposition, or Q supports the Seifert geometry, or Q supports the hyperbolic
geometry.

Our second result is a signiﬁcant (negative) answer for Question 1.5 when the

3-manifold has non-vanishing simplicial volume.

Theorem 1.9. For any closed oriented 3-manifold M with non-vanishing simplicial
volume,

{

SV (M ′)
[M ′ : M ]

| M ′ ∈ CM }

is not bounded, where CM is the set of all ﬁnite covers of M .

As the proof of Theorem 1.7, the proof of Theorem 1.9 is also a reaction of
[DLW] and [Sun], but in a more complicated manner. A degree controlled version
of the design in [DLW] is needed, and Theorem 1.6 will be replaced by the following
Theorem1.10, which has its own signiﬁcance on dominations and simplicial volumes,
and its proof is based on Theorem 1.6 and a recent result of Gaifullin [Ga].

VIRTUAL REPRESENTATION VOLUME AND VIRTUAL DOMINATION

Theorem 1.10. For any closed oriented hyperbolic 3–manifold M , there exists
a positive constant c(M ) such that the following statement holds. For any closed
oriented 3–manifold N and any ǫ > 0, there exists a ﬁnite cover M ′ of M which
admits a non–zero degree map f : M ′ → N , such that

kM ′k ≤ c(M ) · |deg(f )| · (kN k + ǫ).

One of the fundamental property of the simplicial volume is that kM ′k ≥
|deg(f )| · kN k holds in the same setting. So Theorem 1.10 gives a bound of this
classical inequality in the other direction, which can be considered as an eﬃcient
version, respect to simplicial volume, of Sun’s virtual domination theorem.

This paper is organized as the following.
Theorem 1.7 was observed ﬁrst as a rather direct reaction of [DLW] and [Sun]
and clearly it also follows from Theorem 1.9. Due to the signiﬁcance of Theorem
1.7 itself, and the fact its proof partly inspires the discover of Theorem 1.9, we
will ﬁrst prove Theorem 1.7, as a warm up of the proof of Theorem 1.9. The
proofs of Theorem 1.7, Theorem 1.10 and Theorem 1.9 occupy Sections 3, 4 and
5 of the paper respectively. Section 2 is a preliminary of 3-manifold topology and
representation volume. Section 6 contains some further questions and observations.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we review the geometric decomposition of 3-manifolds and the

theory of representation volumes.

2.1. Geometry and Topology of 3-manifolds after Thurston. Let N be a
connected compact prime orientable 3-manifold with toral or empty boundary. As a
consequence of the geometrization of 3-manifolds [Th1, Th2] achieved by G. Perel-
man and W. Thurston, exactly one of the following case holds:

• Either N is geometric, supporting one of the following eight geometries:
H3, ^SL2(R), H2 × R, Sol, Nil, R3, S3 and S2 × R (where Hn, Rn and
Sn are the n-dimensional hyperbolic space, Euclidean space, and spherical
space respectively);

• or N has a canonical nontrivial geometric decomposition. In other words,
there is a nonempty minimal union T¸ N ⊂ N of disjoint essential tori and
Klein bottles in N , unique up to isotopy, such that each component of
N \ T¸ N is either Seifert ﬁbered or atoroidal. In the Seifert ﬁbered case,
the piece supports the H2 × R geometry and the ^SL2(R) geometry. In the
atoroidal case, the piece supports the H3 geometry.

When N has nontrivial geometric decomposition, we call the components of N \ T¸ N
the geometric pieces of N , or more speciﬁcally, Seifert pieces or hyperbolic pieces
according to their geometry.

Traditionally, there is another decomposition introduced by Jaco–Shalen [JS] and
Johannson [Joh], known as the JSJ decomposition. When N contains no essential
Klein bottles and has a nontrivial geometric decomposition, the JSJ decomposition
of N coincides with its geometric decomposition, so the cutting tori and the geo-
metric pieces are also the JSJ tori and the JSJ pieces, respectively. Possibly after
passing to a double cover of N , we may assume that N contains no essential Klein
bottle.

A hyperbolic piece J can be realized as a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold of
ﬁnite volume, unique up to isometry (by Mostow Rigidity). Let J be a compact,
orientable 3-manifold whose boundary consists of tori T1, . . . , Tp and whose interior
admits a complete hyperbolic metric. Identify J with the complement of p disjoint
cusps in the corresponding hyperbolic manifold, then ∂J has a Euclidean metric
induced from the hyperbolic structure, and each closed Euclidean geodesic in ∂J
has the induced length. The Hyperbolic Dehn Filling Theorem of Thurston [Th1,
Theorem 5.8.2] can be stated in the following form.

Theorem 2.1. There is a positive constant C such that the closed 3-manifold
J(ζ1, . . . , ζn) obtained by Dehn ﬁlling each Ti along a slope ζi ⊂ Ti admits a com-
plete hyperbolic structure if each ζi has length greater than C. Moreover, with
suitably chosen base points, J(ζ1, . . . , ζn) converges to the corresponding cusped hy-
perbolic 3-manifold in the Gromov–Hausdorﬀ sense as the minimal length of ζi
tends to inﬁnity.

A Seifert piece J of a non-geometric prime closed 3-manifold N supports both the
H2 × R geometry and the ^SL2(R) geometry. In this paper, we are more interested
in the latter case, so we describe the structure of ^SL2(R) geometric manifolds in
the following.

We consider the group PSL(2; R) as the orientation preserving isometries of the
hyperbolic 2-space H2 = {z ∈ C| ℑ(z) > 0} with i as a base point.
In this
way PSL(2; R) is a (topologically trivial) circle bundle over H2. Let p : ^SL2(R) →
PSL(2; R) be the universal covering of PSL(2; R) with the induced metric, then
^SL2(R) is a line bundle over H2. For any α ∈ R, denote by sh(α) the element

of ^SL2(R) whose projection into PSL(2; R) is given by (cid:18) cos(2πα)

− sin(2πα)

sin(2πα)

cos(2πα)(cid:19).

Then the set {sh(n)| n ∈ Z} is the kernel of p, as well as the center of ^SL2(R), acting
by integral translation along the ﬁbers of ^SL2(R). By extending this Z-action on the
ﬁbers by the R-action, we get the whole identity component of the isometry group
of ^SL2(R). To summarize, we have the following diagram of central extensions

(x′, h′) if and only if there exists an integer n ∈ Z such that x′ − x = n and
h′ = sh(−n) ◦ h.

From [BG2] we know that a closed orientable 3-manifold J supports the ^SL2(R)
geometry, i.e. there is a discrete and faithful representation ψ : π1J → Iso ^SL2(R),

if and only if J is a Seifert ﬁbered space with non-zero Euler number e(J) and
negative Euler characteristic χO(J) of the base orbifold.

2.2. Representation volumes of closed manifolds. In this subsection, we re-
call the deﬁnition of volume of representations. There are a few equivalent deﬁni-
tions, and we will only state one of them.

Given a semi-simple, connected Lie group G and a closed oriented manifold M n
of the same dimension as the contractible space X n = G/K, where K is a maximal
compact subgroup of G. We can associate to each representation ρ : π1M → G, a
volume volG(M, ρ) in the following way.

First ﬁx a G-invariant Riemannian metric gX on X, and denote by ωX the

denotes the composition of paths.

corresponding G-invariant volume form. Let fM denote the universal covering of M .
We think of the elements ex of fM as the homotopy classes of paths γ : [0, 1] → M
with γ(0) = x0 which are acted by π1(M, x0) by setting [σ].ex = [σ.γ], where .
A developing map Dρ : fM → X associated to ρ is a π1M -equivariant map such
that for any x ∈ fM and α ∈ π1M , we have

Dρ(α.x) = ρ(α)Dρ(x)

where ρ(α) acts on X as an isometry. Such a map does exist and can be constructed
explicitly as in [BCG]: Fix a triangulation ∆M of M , then its lift is a triangulation

∆ fM of fM , which is π1M -invariant. Then ﬁx a fundamental domain Ω of M in fM

misses the frontier of Ω. Let {x1, . . . , xl} be the

such that the zero skeleton ∆0

in Ω, and let {y1, . . . , yl} be any l points in X. We ﬁrst set

:

Dρ(xi) = yi, i = 1, . . . , l.
for any vertex x in ∆0
Then extend Dρ in an π1M -equivariant way to ∆0
,
fM
fM
there is a unique vertex xi in Ω and αx ∈ π1M such that αx.xi = x, and we
set Dρ(x) = ρ(αx)−1Dρ(xi). Finally we extend Dρ to edges, faces, etc., and n-
simplices of ∆ fM by straightening their images to totally geodesics objects using
the homogeneous metric on the contractible space X. This map is unique up to
equivariant homotopy. Then D∗
therefore can be thought of as a closed n-form on M . Then we deﬁne

ρ(ωX ) is a π1M -invariant closed n-form on fM ,

sXi=1
Here {∆1, . . . , ∆s} are the n-simplices of ∆M , e∆i is a lift of ∆i and ǫi = ±1 depends
on whether Dρ|e∆i preserves the orientation or not.

In this section, we will ﬁrst review a few results in [DLW], then give the proof

of Theorem 1.7.

3.1. Results in [DLW] on the Representation Volume. In [DW2] and [DLW],
the following additivity principle is proved, by using the relation between the rep-
resentation volume and the Chern–Simons theory. This result allows us to compute
the representation volume by information on the JSJ-pieces.

8

PIERRE DERBEZ, YI LIU, HONGBIN SUN, AND SHICHENG WANG

Theorem 3.1. [DLW, Theorem 3.5 (Additivity Principle)] Let M be an ori-
ented closed 3-manifold with JSJ tori T1, · · · , Tr and JSJ pieces J1, · · · , Jk, and
let ζ1, · · · , ζr be slopes on T1, · · · , Tr, respectively.

Suppose that G is either Isoe

^SL2(R) or PSL(2; C), and that

ρ : π1(M ) → G

is a representation vanishing on the slopes ζi, and that bρi : π1(bJi) → G are the
induced representations, where bJi is the Dehn ﬁlling of Ji along slopes adjacent to

its boundary, with the induced orientations. Then:

volG(M, ρ) = volG(bJ1,bρ1) + volG(bJ2,bρ2) + . . . + volG(bJk,bρk).

The following simple lemma is given in [DLW], which suggests that we should

focus on those JSJ-pieces whose groups have non-elementary images under ρ.

^SL2(R) or PSL(2; C) and that
Lemma 3.2 ([DLW]). Suppose that G is either Isoe
M is a closed oriented 3-manifold. If ρ : π1M → G has image either inﬁnite cyclic
or ﬁnite, then volG(M, ρ) = 0.

The existence of a class inversion for the target group played an important role
in [DLW] for constructing virtual representation of mixed 3-manifold groups, and
will continue to play important roles in this paper. We ﬁrst quote the following
deﬁnition from [DLW].

Deﬁnition 3.3 ([DLW, Deﬁnition 5.1]). Let G be an arbitrary group and { [Ai] }i∈I
be a collection of conjugacy classes of abelian subgroups. By a class inversion with
respect to { [Ai] }i∈I , we mean an outer automorphism [ν] ∈ Out(G ), such that for
any representative abelian subgroup Ai of each [Ai], there is a representative auto-
morphism νAi : G → G of [ν] that preserves Ai, taking every a ∈ Ai to its inverse.
We say G is class invertible with respect to { [Ai]}i∈I , if there exists a class inver-
sion. We often ambiguously call any collection of representative abelian subgroups
{ Ai }i∈I a class invertible collection, and call any representative automorphism ν
a class inversion.

Now we state the following fundamental construction in [DLW] about virtual
representation extensions, which uses Przytycki-Wise’s work on understanding the
virtual property of 3-manifolds with nontrivial geometric decomposition ([PW1],
[PW2], [PW3]), as well as the work of Wise and others ([Wi], [HW], [RW] and
[Liu]).

Theorem 3.4. [DLW, Theorem 5.2] Let G be a group, and M be an irreducible
orientable closed 3-manifold with non-trivial JSJ-decomposition. For a ﬁxed JSJ
piece J0 ⊂ M , suppose a representation

satisﬁes the following:

ρ0 : π1(J0) → G

• for every boundary torus T ⊂ ∂J0, ρ0 has nontrivial kernel restricted to

π1(T ); and

• for all boundary tori T ⊂ ∂J0, ρ0(π1(T )) form a class invertible collection

of abelian subgroups of G .

VIRTUAL REPRESENTATION VOLUME AND VIRTUAL DOMINATION

Then there exist a ﬁnite regular cover

and a representation

satisfying the following:

κ : fM → M,
eρ : π1(fM ) → G ,

a class inversion, conjugate to the pull-back κ∗(ρ0); and

• for one or more elevations fJ0 of J0, the restriction of eρ to π1(fJ0) is, up to
• for any elevation eJ other than the above, of any geometric piece J, the
restriction of eρ to π1(eJ) is cyclic, possibly trivial.

3.2. Proof of Theorem 1.7. Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.7, and here is
a sketch of the strategy. Since we can suppose that the manifold has a hyperbolic
JSJ-piece, Theorem 1.6 gives a virtual representation of the hyperbolic piece with
positive Seifert volume. Then with Lemma 3.7, Theorem 3.4 extends the virtual
representation to the whole manifold, and Theorem 3.1 and Lemma 3.2 computes
the volume of the virtual representation.

By Theorem 1.3 (1) and Theorem 1.6, we may assume that M has non-trivial
JSJ decomposition and contains a hyperbolic JSJ-piece J in M . Suppose ∂J is a
union of tori T1, ..., Tk. Let αi be a slope on Ti, then call α = {α1, ..., αk} a slope
on ∂M . Denote by J(α) the closed orientable 3-manifold obtained by Dehn ﬁlling
of k solid tori S1, ..., Sk to J along α. We can choose α so that J(α) is a hyperbolic
3-manifold (Theorem 2.1).

Take a closed orientable manifold N of non-vanishing Seifert volume. For ex-
ample, a circle bundle N with Euler class e 6= 0 over a closed surface of Euler
characteristic χ < 0 works: In fact, for such N ,

SV(N ) =

4π2|χ|2

|e|

> 0.

By Theorem 1.6 there is a ﬁnite cover q : Q → J(α) such that Q dominates N ,
therefore SV (Q) > 0. Let S = ∪Si, then S′ = q−1(S) ⊂ Q is a union of solid tori
and J ′ = Q \ S′ is a connected 3-manifold which covers J. Moreover, Q is obtained
by Dehn ﬁlling S′ to J ′ along α′, where α′ is a slope of ∂J ′ which covers α (i.e.
each component of α′ is an elevation of a component of α). Fix J ′ and α′ for the
moment, we have the following statement.

Lemma 3.5. Let eJ be a ﬁnite covering of J ′ and eα be the slope of ∂eJ which covers
α′, then SV (eJ(eα)) > 0
Proof. By the choice of eα, the covering eJ → J ′ extends to a branched covering
eJ(eα) → J ′(α′) branched over the cores of S′. Since the branched covering is a map
of non-zero degree, and SV (J ′(α′)) > 0, we have SV (eJ(eα)) > 0.
According to Proposition 4.2 of [DLW], there is a ﬁnite cover p : fM → M such
that each JSJ-piece eJ of fM that covers J factors through J ′. In particular, in the
notions we just used, eJ(eα) > 0. To simplify the notions, we still donate fM , eJ, eα

by M , J, α. Since Theorem 1.7 states a virtual property, we need only to prove
the following statement.

Theorem 3.6. Suppose M is a closed orientable 3-manifold with non-trivial JSJ-
decomposition, and there is a JSJ-piece J and a slope α of ∂J such that SV (J(α)) >

0. Then there is a ﬁnite cover fM of M such that SV (fM ) > 0.

We are going to apply Theorem 3.4 to prove Theorem 3.6. So we ﬁrst need to
check that, the 3-manifold M and the local representation ρ : π1(J) → G (which
gives positive representation volume for J(α)) in Theorem 3.6 meets the two con-
ditions of Theorem 3.4.

We ﬁrst write a presentation of π1(J(α)) from π1(J) by attaching k relations
^SL2(R) be the identity component of Iso ^SL2(R),
from Dehn ﬁllings. Let G = Isoe
the isometry group of the Seifert space ^SL2(R). Then the condition SV (J(α)) > 0
implies that there is a representation ρ : π1(J) → G such that for each component
Ti of ∂J, ρ(π1(Ti)) is a (possibly trivial) cyclic group. Moreover, ρ extends to

bρ : π1(J(α)) → G such that VG(J(α),bρ) > 0. So the ﬁrst condition of Theorem 5.2

of [DLW] is satisﬁed. The following lemma, which strengthens [DLW, Lemma 6.1
(2)], implies that the second condition of Theorem 5.2 of [DLW] is also satisﬁed.

^SL2(R) is class invertible with respect to all its cyclic subgroups,
Lemma 3.7. Isoe
and a class inversion can be realized by an inner automorphism of Iso ^SL2(R). The
corresponding action on ^SL2(R) preserves the orientation.

Proof. There are short exact sequences of groups

Recall that there are no orientation reversing isometries in the ^SL2(R) geometry.
For each element ν in the component of Iso ^SL2(R) not containing the identity,
^SL2(R)). So νrν−1 = r−1 for any
ν reverses the orientation of R (the center of Isoe
^SL2(R) is class invertible with respect to its center R, and a class
r ∈ R, and Isoe
inversion can be realized by an inner automorphism of Iso ^SL2(R), the corresponding
action on ^SL2(R) preserves the orientation. Actually, this part of the proof is same
with the proof of [DLW, Lemma 6.1(ii)]).

In the following, we suppose that hαi is a cyclic subgroup of Isoe

^SL2(R) generated

by an non-central element α.

For each non-trivial element a in Iso+H2, it is straightforward to see that there
exists a reﬂection about a geodesic la in H2 that conjugats a to its inverse. The
la can be chosen as: (i) passing through the rotation center when a is elliptic, (ii)
perpendicular with the axis of a when a is hyperbolic, (iii) passing through the
ﬁxed point when a is parabolic.

By the discussion in the last paragraph and the exact sequences, there exists an
element ν ∈ Iso ^SL2(R) lying in the component of Iso ^SL2(R) not containing the
identity, such that p(ν) is a reﬂection of H2 conjugating p(α) to its inverse, namely,
p(ν−1αν) = p(α−1). We claim that

ν−1αν = α−1.

VIRTUAL REPRESENTATION VOLUME AND VIRTUAL DOMINATION

11

In fact, by the short exact sequences above, we have that ν−1aν = a−1r for some

r in the center R. Since p(ν) is a reﬂection, ν2 is central, so

a = ν−2aν2 = ν−1(a−1r)ν = (ν−1rν)(ν−1aν)−1 = r−1(a−1r)−1 = ar−2.

Here we used that fact that ν is a class inversion for hri. So r−2 is trivial, and r
is trivial as the center is torsion free. This veriﬁes the claim. We conclude that ν
realizes a class inversion of the cyclic subgroup hai of Isoe

^SL2(R).

Suppose we have two elements α1, α2 ∈ Isoe

^SL2(R). Then there exist ν1, ν2 ∈
Iso ^SL2(R) such that ν−1
, and p(νi) is a reﬂection of H2, for i = 1, 2.
Since any two reﬂections on H2 are conjugate with each other by an element b ∈
^SL2(R). Therefore we

Proof of Theorem 3.6. Fix J, α, and ρ : π1(J) → G as our previous discussion,
and denote them by J0, α0, and ρ0 to match the notations of Theorem 3.4. Since
ρ0 : π1(J0) → G meets the two conditions of Theorem 3.4, we can virtually extend

of fM with respect to eρ is positive, which implies SV ( ˜M ) > 0.

By Lemma 3.7, the class inversions can be realized by conjugations of orientation
preserving isomorphisms of ^SL2(R), therefore the volumes of all these elevations

4. Efficient virtual domination by hyperbolic 3-manifolds

We are going to prove Theorem 1.10 and we restate it for convenience.

Theorem 1.10. For any closed oriented hyperbolic 3–manifold M , there exists
a positive constant c(M ) such that the following statement holds. For any closed
oriented 3–manifold N and any ǫ > 0, there exists a ﬁnite cover M ′ of M which
admits a non–zero degree map f : M ′ → N , such that

kM ′k ≤ c(M ) · |deg(f )| · (kN k + ǫ).

Remark 4.1. In fact, the same statement holds true for any closed orientable
manifold which virtually dominates all closed orientable manifolds of the same
dimension. For dimension 3, all hyperbolic manifolds have such property [Sun].
For any arbitrary dimension, manifolds with this property have been discovered by
A. Gaifullin [Ga]. The 3-dimension example MΠ3 of Gaifullin is not a hyperbolic
manifold, but we point out that a constant c0 = 24v8 / v3 ≈ 86.64 is suﬃcient for
this case, where v8 is the volume of the ideal regular hyperbolic octahedron and v3
is the volume of the ideal regular hyperbolic tetrahedron.

4.1. URC manifolds. As introduced by A. Gaifullin [Ga], a closed orientable
(topological) n-manifold M is said to have the property of Universal Realisation
of Cycles (URC ) if every homology class of Hn(X; Z) of an arbitrary topological
space X has a positive integral multiple which can be realized by a fundamental
class of M via a map f : M → X.

For any arbitrary dimension n, Gaifullin shows that examples of URC n-

manifolds can be obtained by taking some 2n-sheeted cover

MΠn

of some n-dimensional orbifold Πn. More precisely, the underlying topology space
of Π is the permutahedron, namely, the polyhedron combinatorially isomorphic
to the convex hull of the points (σ(1), · · · , σ(n + 1)) of Rn+1 where σ runs over
all permutations of {1, . . . , n + 1}. The orbifold structure of Π is given so that
each codimension-1 face is a reﬂection wall, so each codimension-k face is the local

2–action. The abelian characteristic cover of Πn on which
2 acts is the orientable closed n-manifold MΠn. In particular, MΠn

The following quantitative version of Gaifullin’s proof [Ga, Section 5] is impor-
tant for our application. Recall that a (compact) pseudo n-manifold is a ﬁnite
simplicial complex of which each simplex is contained in an n-simplex and each
(n − 1)-simplex is contained in exactly two n-simplices. Topologically, a pseudo
n-manifold is just a manifold away from its codimension-2 skeleton. So a strongly
connected orientable pseudo n-manifold means that, away from the codimension-2
skeleton, the manifold is connected and orientable, or equivalently, that the n-
dimensional integral homology of is isomorphic to Z.
In particular, the concept
of (unsigned) mapping degree can be extended similarly to maps between strongly
connected orientable pseudo n-manifolds.

Theorem 4.2 (Cf.
pseudo n-manifold Z, there exists a ﬁnite cover M ′
map f1 : M ′

[Ga, Proposition 5.3]). For any strongly connected orientable
Πn of MΠn and a non-zero degree

Πn → Z, such that
#{n-permutahedra of M ′

Πn} = (n + 1)! · |deg(f1)| · #{n-simplices of Z}.

cMΠn = UΠn/ΓH there has been rewritten as M ′

Remark 4.3. The map f1 is as asserted by [Ga, Proposition 5.3]. The cover
Πn in our paraphrase. To compare
with the statement of [Ga, Proposition 5.3], the index |W : ΓH | there equals the
number of permutahedra in ˜MΠn here; the notation |A| there stands for the number
of n-simplices in the barycentric subdivision of Z, which equals (n + 1)! times the
number of n-simplices of Z here. For dimension 3, all orientable closed hyperbolic
manifold are known to be URC [Sun].

4.2. Virtual domination through URC 3-manifolds. We combine the results
of [Ga] and [Sun] to prove Theorem 1.10. The following lemma allows us to create
an eﬃcient virtual realization of the fundamental class of N :

Lemma 4.4. For any closed oriented n–manifold N and any ǫ > 0, there exists a
connected oriented pseudo n–manifold Z and a non–zero degree map f : Z → N ,
such that

#{n–simplices in Z} ≤ |deg(f )| · (kN k + ǫ).

Proof. By the deﬁnition of the simplicial volume, for any ǫ > 0, there exists a
singular cycle

α =

siσi ∈ Zn(N, R)

such that [α] = [N ] ∈ Hn(N, R) and

In particular, [Pk

Here we can think that we have mri copies of the standard oriented n–simplex
i=1(mri)σi being an n–cycle implies
that we can ﬁnd a pairing of all the (n − 1)–dimensional faces of the collection of
copies of σis, such that each such pair are mapped to the same singular (n − 1)-
simplex with opposite orientation.

This pairing instructs us to build an oriented pseudo–manifold Z ′ (possibly dis-
connected).

i=1 induces a map f0 : Z ′ → N .

Let [Z ′] be the homology class in Hn(Z ′) which is represented by the n–cycle
which takes each oriented n–simplex in Z ′ exactly once.
It is easy to see that
f0([Z ′]) = [β] = m[N ], so f0 has mapping degree deg(f0) = m. Moreover, the
number of n–simplices in Z ′ is just

(mri) = m(

ri) < m(kN k + ǫ) = deg(f0) · (kN k + ǫ).

If Z ′ is connected, we are done with the proof. If Z ′ is disconnected, take the

component Z of Z ′ such that

Then f = f0|Z satisﬁes the desired condition in this lemma.

cause ˜M is constructed by Theorem 1.6 without referring to N or ǫ. This completes
the proof of Theorem 1.10.

4.3. Asymptotic growth of Seifert volume of closed hyperbolic 3–
manifold. We have mentioned in the introduction that Theorem 1.7 for closed
hyperbolic 3-manifolds follows directly from Theorem 1.6. Similarly, Theorem 1.9
for hyperbolic closed 3-manifolds is a corollary of Theorem 1.10, which shows that
the growth of the Seifert volume of ﬁnite covers of any closed hyperbolic 3–manifold
is faster than the linear rate.

5.2. CI completions of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Theorem 5.1 (2) suggested,

to prove the theorem, we should relate the presentation ρ : π1( ˜M ′) −→ IsoefSL2
to the hyperbolic 3-manifold bJ0. In general, ρ even may not factor through ﬁnite
covers of bJ0 involved in the theorem. To overcome this diﬃcult, we introduce

CI completions, where CI is a brievation for class inversion, for orientable closed
hyperbolic 3-manifolds with respect to a collection of mutually distinct embedded
closed geodesics, so that the proof of Theorem 5.1 can be carried out.

In general, given an arbitrary group with a collection of conjugacy classes of
abelian subgroups, it is possible to embed the group into a larger group which pos-
sesses a class inversion with respect to the induced collection. The idea is explored
in a special case of CI completions for orientable closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds with
respect to a collection of mutually distinct embedded closed geodesics.

5.2.1. Construction of the CI completion. Let V be an orientable closed hyperbolic
3-manifold, and let γ1, · · · , γs be a collection of mutually distinct embedded closed
geodesics of V .

The CI completion of V with respect to γ1, · · · , γs is a pair

(W, σW )

where W is a speciﬁc CW space equipped with a distinguished embedding V → W
and σW : W → W is a free involution. The construction is as follows.

Take the product space V × Z where Z is endowed with the discrete topology,
and for each γi, take a cylinder Li parametrized as S1 × R, where S1 is identiﬁed
with the unit circle of the complex plane C. We regard each closed geodesic γi as
a map S1 → V . Identify the circles S1 × Z of Li with closed geodesics of V × Z by
taking any point (z, n) ∈ S1 × Z to either (γi(z), n) or (γi(¯z), n) depending on the
parity of n. We agree to use γi(z) for even n and γi(¯z) for odd n. The resulting

space fWZ is equipped with a covering transformation σ : fWZ → fWZ which takes

any point (x, n) ∈ V × Z to (x, n + 1), and any point (z, t) ∈ Li to (¯z, t + 1). The
quotient of ˜WZ by the action of hσ2i is a space W with a covering transformation
σW induced by σ.

One may visualize the further quotient space W / hσW i as a 3-manifold V with
Klein bottles hanging on the closed geodesics γi, one on each. Then W is a double
cover of that space into which V lifts, and on which the deck transformation σW
acts. As a CW space with a free involution, the isomorphism type of (W, σW ) is
independent of the auxiliary parametrizations in the construction, and the isomor-
phism may further be required to ﬁx the distinguished inclusion of V .

5.2.2. Properties of CI completions.

Proposition 5.2. Let V be an orientable closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, and let
γ1, · · · , γs be a collection of mutually distinct embedded closed geodesics of V . De-
note by (W, σW ) the CI completion of V with respect to γ1, · · · , γs.

(1) The outer automorphism of π1(W ) induced by σW is a class inversion of
π1(W ) with respect to the collection of conjugacy classes of the maximal
cyclic subgroups π1(γ1), · · · , π1(γs) of π1(W ) corresponding to the canoni-
cally included free loops;

(2) Suppose that G is a group which possesses a class inversion [ν] ∈ Out(G )
with respect to the conjugacy classes of all the cyclic subgroups. Then for

VIRTUAL REPRESENTATION VOLUME AND VIRTUAL DOMINATION

19

any homomorphism η : π1(V ) → G then there exists an extension of η to
π1(W ):

η : π1(W ) → G .

Moreover, for any representative automorphism σW ♯, ν of the outer autor-
morphisms accordingly, the image ησW ♯(π1(V )) is conjugate to νη(π1(V ))
in G .

(3) Suppose that κ : V ′ → V is a covering map of ﬁnite degree. Denote by
(W ′, σW ′ ) the CI completion of V ′ with respect to all the elevations in V ′
of γ1, · · · , γs. Then there exists an extension of κ:

κ : W ′ → W

which is a covering map equivariant under the action of σW ′ and σW . In
particular, the covering degree is preserved under the extension.

Proof. Recall that W is topologically the union of V , σW (V ), and annuli Ai,
σW (Ai). Each annulus Ai has its boundary attached to V ⊔ σW (V ) in such a way
that γi ⊂ V can be freely homotoped to the orientation-reversal of σW (γi) ⊂ σW (V )
through Ai, and the annuli σW (Ai) make the homotopy as well.

Statement (1) is now obvious from the above description.
Statement (2) can also be seen topologically. To this end, let X be a CW model
for the Eilenberg–MacLane CW space K(G , 1). Uniquely up to free homotopy, the
outer automorphism [ν] can be realized by a map R : X → X, and the homo-
morphism η can be realized as a map f : V → X. With respect to the inclusion
V → W , we deﬁne a map F : W → X, which extends f , as follows. First deﬁne
the restriction of F to V and σW (V ) are f and Rf , respectively. Since ν is a class
inversion, each f γi is freely homotopic to the orientation-reversal of Rf γi, as a map
S1 → X, so the homotopy deﬁnes maps F | : Ai → X and F | : σW (Ai) → X. The
resulting map F : W → X extends f : V → X, so on the level of fundamental
groups, it gives rise to the claimed extension of η : π1(V ) → G over π1(W ).

Statement (3) follows from construction on further quotient spaces. Observe that
the quotient space W / hσW i, rewritten as ¯W , is topologically the union of V and
Klein bottles Bi, where Bi are projected from Ai. Then any ﬁnite covering map
V ′ → V gives rise to a covering map of the same degree ¯W ′ → ¯W . The covering of
Klein bottles are induced by the coverings of γi ⊂ ¯W by their elevations. In fact,
the covering ¯W ′ → ¯W is unique up to homotopy. The covering ¯W ′ → ¯W induces
two equivariant covering maps W ′ → W , diﬀering by deck transformation. The
one that respects the distinguished inclusions is as claimed.

5.3. Virtual representations through CI completions. With our gadgets of
CI completions, we invoke Theorem 3.4 to derive the asserted virtual representations
of Theorem 5.1.

(Proposition 5.2 (1)), Theorem 3.4 can be applied with the target group π1(W ) and
the initial homomorphism:

π1(J0) −→ π1(W )

induced by the composition of the Dehn ﬁlling inclusion J0 ⊂ bJ0 and the canonical
inclusion bJ0 ⊂ W . The output is a ﬁnite cover ˜M of M together with a homomor-

φ : π1( ˜M ) −→ π1(W ),

phism:

with described restrictions to its JSJ pieces. Since the CI completion W is an
Eilenberg–MacLane space K(π1(W ), 1), it would be convenient to realize φ as a
map

f : ˜M −→ W,

which is unique up to homotopy.

Suppose for the moment that we are provided with a representation:

rather than a virtual representation. By Proposition 5.2 (2) and Lemma 3.7, there
is an extension over π1(W ), (which is still denoted by η0, regarding the original one
as restriction,) so that the composition:

η0 : π1(bJ0) −→ IsoefSL2,

gives rise to a virtual extension of the representation

At this basic level, the virtual extension is nothing but a ﬁner version of Theo-
rem 3.4 for the special case of Seifert representations about mixed 3-manifolds. It
exhibits a factorization of ˜ρ through the CI completion π1(W ). However, Propo-
sition 5.2 (3) allows us to promote the above construction to deal with virtual

representations of π1(eJ0).

Remember that we have obtained a ﬁnite cover ˜M and a map f : ˜M → W for

f ′ : ˜M ′ −→ W ′.

This means that the following diagram is commutative up to homotopy:

˜M ′

f ′

−−−−→ W ′

y

˜M

yκ

f

−−−−→ W

and ˜M ′ → ˜M is the covering of ˜M which is minimal in the sense that it admits no
intermediate covering of this property. (More concretely, one may replace W with
the mapping cylinder Yf ≃ W , and turn the map f into an inclusion ˜M → Yf ,
then any elevation ˜M ′ → Y ′
f ≃ W ′ gives
rise to some f ′ : ˜M ′ → Y ′
f → W ′ up to homotopy.) Since W ′ is a ﬁnite cover of W ,
there are only ﬁnitely many such elevations ( ˜M ′, f ′) up to isomorphism between
covering spaces and homotopy. Moreover, the covering degree [ ˜M ′ : ˜M ] is bounded
by [W ′ : W ]. Denote by

f of ˜M in the corresponding ﬁnite cover Y ′

the homomorphism (up to conjugation) induced by f ′.

Provided with η and φ′ above, we extend η to be

φ′ : π1( ˜M ′) −→ π1(W ′)

by Proposition 5.2 (1) and (3) and Lemma 3.7. The ﬁnite cover

η : π1(W ′) −→ IsoefSL2

˜M ′ −→ M

and the representation:

ρ : π1( ˜M ′)

φ′
−→ π1(W ′)

are the claimed objects in the conclusion of Theorem 5.1.

Homomorphisms which have been presented can be summarized in the following

The homomorphisms φ and φ′ are realized by maps f and f ′ respectively. The
representation ρ that we have constructed is the composition along the middle row.

We are going to verify Theorem 5.1 (2) in the next three subsections.

5.3.3. Restriction to JSJ pieces. For any elevation ˜J ′ ⊂ ˜M ′ of a JSJ piece J ⊂ M ,
˜J ′ covers a JSJ piece ˜J of ˜M . Since we have constructed φ using Theorem 3.4, either
the restriction of φ to π1( ˜J ) has cyclic image, or J is the distinguished hyperbolic
piece J0 and the restriction of φ to π1( ˜J ) is one of the following compositions up
to conjugation of π1(W ):

π1( ˜J ) −→ π1(bJ0) −→ π1(W )

PIERRE DERBEZ, YI LIU, HONGBIN SUN, AND SHICHENG WANG

22

or

π1( ˜J ) −→ π1(bJ0) −→ π1(W )

σW−→ π1(W ).

In the cyclic case, the restriction of φ′ to π1( ˜J ′) must also have cyclic image as κ♯ is
injective. Then the restriction of ρ to π1( ˜J ′) has cyclic image as well. In the other
case, the ﬁrst homomorphism of either composition factors through π1(J0) via the
Dehn ﬂling, possibly after homotopy of f , we may assume that ˜J covers either J0 or
σW (J0) under the map f . As f ′ is an elevation of f with respect to κ, the elevation
˜J ′ of ˜J covers either the unique elevation J ′
0 of J0 or the unique elevation σW ′ (J ′
0)
of σW (J0) in W ′. Note that η is equivariant up to conjugacy with respect to the
class inversions σW ′ and ν, (Proposition 5.2 and Lemma 3.7). It follows that by
taking

the composition of the covering and the inclusion, the restriction of ρ to π1( ˜J ′) is
either β∗(η) or β∗(νη). This veriﬁes Theorem 5.1 (1).

β : ˜J ′ −→ J ′

0 −→ bJ ′

5.3.4. Count of degree. By the consideration about the restriction of ρ to JSJ pieces
of ˜M ′ above, we have seen that a JSJ piece ˜J ′ gives rise to the β-pull-back type
restriction of ρ if and only if ˜J ′ covers a JSJ piece ˜J of ˜M such that φ(π1( ˜J)) is
non-cyclic. The union of all such ˜J in ˜M form a (disconnected) ﬁnite cover ˜J of
the distinguished piece J0 ⊂ M , and the union of all β-pull-back type ˜J ′ in ˜M ′ is
nothing but the preimage ˜J ′ of ˜J in ˜M ′. Therefore, the total degree of β-pull-back
type JSJ pieces of ˜M ′ over J0 equals:

[ ˜J ′ : J0] = [ ˜J ′ : ˜J ] · [ ˜J : J0] = [ ˜M ′ : ˜M ] · [ ˜J : J0]

=

[ ˜J : J0]
[ ˜M : M ]

[ ˜M ′ : M ] = α0 · [ ˜M ′ : M ],

where α0 equals [ ˜J :J0]
[ ˜M :M]

and φ are constructed according to them, and α0 is positive because ˜J is non-empty
by Theorem 3.4.

. Note that α0 depends only on M and J0 → bJ0 since ˜M

5.3.5. Count of volume. In very similar situation as in the proof of Theorem 1.7,
to compute the volume of the representation

it suﬃces to understand the contribution to the representation volume of ρ from
the β-pull-back type JSJ pieces ˜J ′ of ˜M ′. Note that the map

β : ˜J ′ cov.−→ J ′
0

ρ : π1( ˜M ′) −→ IsoefSL2,
ﬁll−→ bJ ′
factors through a unique hyperbolic Dehn ﬁlling ˜K ′ of ˜J ′ which covers bJ ′
over elevations of the core curves γi via a map bβ:
−→ bJ ′
−→ IsoefSL2,

The restriction of ρ to π1( ˜J ′) thus factorizes as:

This completes the proof of Theorem 5.1 (2), therefore the proof of Theorem 5.1.

6. On covering invariants

As we mentioned in the introduction that neither the hyperbolic volume nor the
Seifert volume have the covering property. However we can normalize them in the
following way so that the resulting invariants have the covering property.

Deﬁnition 6.1. For any closed orientable 3-manifold M , deﬁne the covering Seifert
volume of M to be

CSV(M ) = lim
←−
˜M

SV( ˜M )
[ ˜M : M ]

,

valued in [0, +∞], where ˜M runs over all the ﬁnite covers of M . Note that the limit
exists because SV( ˜M ) / [ ˜M : M ] is non-decreasing under passing to ﬁnite covers.
Similarly one can deﬁne the covering hyperbolic volume CHV(M).

Proposition 6.2. if CSV(∗) (resp. CHV(*)) is valued on [0, +∞) for a class
of closed orientable 3-manifolds. Then it satisﬁes both domination property and
covering property in this class.

24

PIERRE DERBEZ, YI LIU, HONGBIN SUN, AND SHICHENG WANG

Proof. We just verify it for CSV (∗).

(1) Domonation property: Suppose f : M → N is map of non-zero degree. By
deﬁnition, for any ǫ > 0, there is a ﬁnite cover ˜N of N such that SV ( ˜N )/[ ˜N : N ] >
CSV (N ) − ǫ. Then we have the following commutative diagram:

˜f

˜M

−−−−→ ˜N

y

M

y

f

−−−−→ N

where ˜M → M is a minimal ﬁnite cover in the sense of 5.3.2, and ˜f lifts f , which
implies that [ ˜M : M ] is bounded by [ ˜N : N ]. Then we have [ ˜M , M ]|deg(f )| =
[ ˜N , N ]|deg( ˜f )|, |deg(f )| ≥ |deg( ˜f )| and SV ( ˜M ) ≥ |deg( ˜f )|SV ( ˜N ).

By those facts and the deﬁnition we have

CSV (M ) ≥

SV ( ˜M )
[ ˜M : M ]

=

SV ( ˜M )|deg(f )|
[ ˜N : N ]|deg( ˜f )|

≥

|deg(f )|SV ( ˜N )

[ ˜N : N ]

≥ |deg(f )|(CSV (N ) − ǫ)

Since ǫ can be arbitrarily small, we have CSV (M ) ≥ |deg(f )|CSV (N ).

(2) Covering property: Suppose f : M → N is a covering. Then any ﬁnite cover

˜M of M is also a ﬁnite cover of N . By deﬁnition we have

SV ( ˜M )
[ ˜M , N ]

≤ CSV (N ),

and by which we have

SV ( ˜M )
[ ˜M , N ]

=

SV ( ˜M )

[ ˜M , M ][M : N ]

=

SV ( ˜M )

[ ˜M , M ]|deg(f )|

≤ CSV (N ),

that is to say

SV ( ˜M )
[ ˜M , M ]

≤ |deg(f )|CSV (N ).

Since this is true for any ﬁnite cover of M , by deﬁnition we have

Combine what is proved in (1), we have exactly

CSV (M ) ≤ |deg(f )|CSV (N ).

CSV (M ) = |deg(f )|CSV (N ).

(cid:3)

Now we post some questions, some of them can be thought as a update of

questions in the end of [DLW].

Although Theorem 1.9 claim CSV (M ) does not exist (=∞) for closed orientable
3-manifold with non-vanishing simplicial volume, the following question is still very
meaningful:

Problem 6.3. If CSV (M ) exists (< ∞) for every closed orientable non-trivial
graph manifold M ?

VIRTUAL REPRESENTATION VOLUME AND VIRTUAL DOMINATION

25

The positive answer provides a nowhere vanishing invariant with covering prop-
erty on all closed non-trivial graph manifolds. To ﬁnd such a invariant was contained
in a suggestion of Thurston [Ki, Problem 3.16], and was tried in some papers, say
[WW], [LW], [Ne] in order to prove the fact that covering degree is uniquely de-
termined by graph manifold involved. The later is proved in [YW] which relies on
combinatoric method and matrix theory.

We know that for any close orientable 3–manifold with non-vanish simplicial
volume, the growth of the Seifert volume of its ﬁnite covers is faster than the linear
rate.

Problem 6.4. Estimate the growth rate of virtual Seifert volume of closed ori-
entable 3-manifolds with non-vanishing simplicial volume.

As we discussed in the introduction, we have HV (M ) ≤ µ3||M || for all closed
orientable 3-manifolds, therefore CHV exists and specially CHV (M ) ≤ µ3||M ||.
Even in general HV (M ) < µ3||M ||, it seems not a risk to ask

Problem 6.5. If CHV (M ) = µ3||M || for all closed orientable 3-manifolds?
