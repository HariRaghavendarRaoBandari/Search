Abstract

The light cone gauge is used frequently in string theory as well as
gauge theories and gravitation. Loop integrals however have to be infrared
regulated to remove spurious poles. The most popular and consistent of
these infrared regulators is the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt(ML) prescription.
The calculations with ML are rather cumbersome, though. In this work
we show that the ML can be replaced by a symmetry of the regulator.
This symmetry simplify the calculations, reducing them to conventional
dimensional regularization integrals.

1 Introduction

Computations in superstring theory as well as gauge theories, supersymmetry,
gravitation and Chern-Simons theories are often simpliﬁed by recurring to the
light cone gauge. The light cone gauge is termed one of the physical gauges
because ghosts decouple in these gauges1. To compute loop corrections in the
light cone gauge has some peculiarities,though: Spurious infrared poles appear,
non local terms are present and Lorentz invariance is explicitly broken. To deal
with these problems an infrared regulator is needed. The most popular and
internally consistent regulator used at present is the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt
regulator (ML)[2, 3]. ML has very nice properties: The poles in the k0 complex
plane are situated such that the Wick’s rotation from Euclidean to Minkowsky
space is justiﬁed; it preserves naive power counting of loop integrals; and in
gauge theories, it maintains the Ward identities of the gauge symmetry[1, 4].

Explicit computations with the ML are long and cumbersome, though.
Here we present a method to evaluate the loop integrals that appear in the
light cone gauge based on a scale symmetry of the regulator. No new integrals
are required, aside from the standard dimensionally regularized integrals.
In
fact the ML prescription can be safely replaced by the scale symmetry and a
regularity condition. We do not have to specify the exact value of the two null

vectors of the ML, but merely its mutual relations. The results coincide with
the one obtained with ML.

2 The new prescription

Let us compute the following simple integral:

Aµ = Z dp

f (p2)pµ
(n · p)

where f is an arbitrary function.dp is the integration measure in d dimensional
space and nµ is a ﬁxed null vector((n·n) = 0). This integral is infrared divergent
when (n · p) = 0.

The ML is:

1

(n · p)

= lim
ε→0

(p · ¯n)

(n · p)(p · ¯n) + iε

(1)

where ¯nµ is a new null vector with the property (n · ¯n) = 1.

To compute Aµ we have to know the speciﬁc form of f , provide an speciﬁc
f (p2)
(n·p) in the p0

form of nµ and ¯nµ, and evaluate the residues of all poles of
complex plane, a rather formidable task for an arbitrary f .

Instead we want to point out the following symmetry:

nµ → λnµ, ¯nµ → λ−1¯nµ, λ 6= 0, λεR

(2)

It preserves the deﬁnitions of nµ and ¯nµ:

We see from (1) that:

0 = (n · n) → λ2(n · n) = 0
0 = (¯n · ¯n) → λ−2(¯n · ¯n) = 0
1 = (n · ¯n) → (n · ¯n) = 1

1

(n · p)

→

1

(n · p)

λ−1

Now we compute Aµ, based on its symmetries.
It is a Lorentz vector which
scales under (2) as λ−1. The only Lorentz vectors we have available in this case
are nµ and ¯nµ. But (2) forbids nµ. That is:

Aµ = a¯nµ

Multiply by nµ to ﬁnd (A · n) = a. Thus a = R dpf (p2). Finally:

Z dp

f (p2)pµ
(n · p)

= ¯nµZ dpf (p2)

By the same token we ﬁnd

Aµνλ = Z dp

f (p2)pµpνpλ

(n · p)

= a(¯nµgνλ)S + b(¯nµ¯nνnλ)S

2

where ()S means symmetric in all Lorentz indices.

We get:

Therefore

Aµνλnλ =

1
d

gµν Z dpf (p2)p2

a =

1

d Z dpf (p2)p2 = −b

The integrals on pµ are dimensionally regularized.
Therefore:

Z dp

f (p2)pµpνpλ

(n · p)

=

1

d Z dpf (p2)p2{(¯nµgνλ)S − (¯nµ ¯nνnλ)S}

2.1 Generic integrals

We consider now a more general integral. We will see here that regularity of
the answer will determine it uniquely.

Consider:

A = Z dp

F (p2, p · q)

(n · p)

= (¯n · q)f (q2, (n · q)(¯n · q))

(3)

qµ is an external momentum, a Lorentz vector. F is an arbitrary function. The
last relation follows from (2), for a certain f we will ﬁnd in the following.

We get

¯nµf (x, y) + 2(¯n · q)qµ

∂
∂x

∂qµ = Z dp
f (x, y) + [(¯n · q)2nµ + (n · q)(¯n · q)¯nµ]

∂A

=

F,upµ
(n · p)
∂
∂y

f (x, y)

We deﬁned u = p · q,x = q2,y = (n · q)(¯n · q). (),u means derivative respects

to u.

∂A

∂qµ nµ = Z dpF,u = g(x) =

f (x, y) + 2y

∂
∂x

f (x, y) + y

∂
∂y

f (x, y)

(4)

Assuming that the solution and its partial derivatives are ﬁnite in the neigh-
borhood of y = 0, it follows from the equation that f (x, 0) = g(x). That is the
partial diﬀerential equation has a unique regular solution.

We will ﬁnd the solution of (4) using the method of characteristics[5].

˙x = 2y
˙f + f = g(x(t))
y = Cet
x − 2y = D

˙y = y

˙x = 2Cet, x = 2Cet + D

3

The most general solution of the system is:

f = be−t + e−tZ t

−∞

dt′et′

g(x(t′))

for b arbitrary corresponding to the solution of (4) with g = 0(homogeneous
solution). The regular solution of (4), f0 , is obtained imposing that b = 0.
The reason being that the homogeneous solution is: f = Π(x − 2y)y−1, with
Π an arbitrary function. We readily see that f will diverge at y = 0, unless
Π(x) = 0, for all x.

Moreover

lim

t→−∞

f0 = lim

t→−∞

e−tZ t

−∞

dt′et′

g(x(t′)) = g(D)

That is f0(x, 0) = g(x). f0 is the unique regular solution of (4).

What we have developed up to here shows that the scale transformation (2)
plus the regularity condition determines uniquely the value of the integral (3).

2.2 Application to loop integrals

We consider now integrals that appear in gauge theory loops:

Z dp

1

[p2 + 2p · q − m2]a

(n · p)

= (¯n · q)f (x, y)

g(x) = −2aZ dp

1

[p2 − x − m2]a+1

In this case

Therefore

f = e−tZ t

−∞

g(x(t′)) =

−

y (cid:26)Z dp[p2 − x − m2]−a −Z dp[p2 − x + 2y − m2]−a(cid:27)
We readily verify that f (x, 0) = −2aR dp[p2 − x − m2]−a−1 = g(x)

In the same way we get:

1

[p2+2p·q−m2]a

1

((n·p))2 = (¯n · q)2

f (x, y)

R dp

with

f (x, y) =

1

y2 Z dp{[p2−x−m2]−a−[p2−x+2y−m2]−a−2ay[p2−x+2y−m2]−a−1}

Following the same procedure we can get an answer for the whole family of

loop integrals:

Z dp

We sketch the proof of equation (5).

((n · p))b = (¯n · q)bf (b, a, x, y)

with

f (b, a, x, y), (6)

f (b, a, x, 0) = −

f (b − 1, a + 1, x, 0) (7)

It is easy to check that (5) satisﬁes the partial diﬀerential equation (6) and
the boundary condition (7), so it is the unique regular solution and thus deter-
mine the value of the integral.

Other integrals can be obtained deriving respects to qµ:

(−1)a+bi(π)ω(−2)b−1 Γ(a+b−ω)
(−1)a+bi(π)ω(−2)b Γ(a+b+1−ω)

The right hand side of equations (5,8,9) is analytic in the parameters a, b, ω
almost everywhere in their respective complex planes, so it provides the analytic
extension of the integral to these wider domains.

3 Comparison with ML

The simpler integral Aµ, Aµνλ of section 2, agree with the ML prescriptions[1].
But, in this section we want to compute a more involved integral, in order

to compare both ﬁnite and divergent results with ML’s.

We want to compute:

A(σ, q) = Z dp

(p2)σ−1

(p − q)2((n · p))2

We introduce Feynman parameters [6]

A(σ, q) = (1 − σ)Z 1

dxZ dp

x−σ

[p2 + (1 − x)(−2p · q + ¯q2)]2−σ((n · p))2

Using (5), we ﬁnally get

A(σ, q) = 4(¯n · q)2(−1)σi(π)ω Γ(4 − σ − ω)

Γ(1 − σ)

0

dxx−σ(1 − x)σ+ω−2

1

Z

0

dtt[q2x + 2t(n · q)(¯n · q)(1 − x)]σ+ω−4

This coincides with [7] equation C4, by the change of variable t = 1 − y and

σ = ω.

Notice that we have considered ¯q2 6= q2 and taken the limit ¯q2 = q2 after
evaluating the integral. This is justiﬁed because the integral is a regular function
of q2.
If we expand A(σ, q) in powers of q2, each term of the series can be
evaluated using (5). The summation of the series is equivalent to the procedure
we followed above.

4 Conclusions

We have developed a way of evaluation of the light cone loop integrals based
on the scale symmetry (2) and the condition of regularity of the solution.We do
not have to specify the exact value of the two null vectors of the ML, but merely
its mutual relations. The answer is the same than in the ML prescription, but
a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation of the calculation is available now.

6

For future work, we want to mention that the scale transformation (2) is also
a symmetry of the uniform prescription introduced by Leibbrandt[1] to treat
the spurious infrared poles in light-cone, axial, planar and temporal gauge. The
application of the method presented here to these more general gauges will be
done elsewhere.
