HAAGERUP’S INEQUALITY AND ADDITIVITY VIOLATION OF

THE MINIMUM OUTPUT ENTROPY

BENOˆIT COLLINS

ABSTRACT. We give a simple and conceptual proof of the fact that ran-
dom unitary channels yield violation of the Minimum Output Entropy
additivity. The proof relies on strong convergence of random unitary
matrices and Haagerup’s inequality.

1. INTRODUCTION

During the last decade, a crucial problem in quantum information was

to determine whether one can ﬁnd two quantum channels Φi : B(Hji) →
B(Hki), i = {1, 2}, such that

Hmin(Φ1 ⊗ Φ2) < Hmin(Φ1) + Hmin(Φ2).

We refer to section 2.1 for deﬁnitions.

This problem was known as the MOE additivity problem, and it was cru-
cial because it is equivalent to the additivity of the Holevo capacity, as well
as other quantities. We refer to the survey [CN16] and bibliography therein
for references. Additivity was proven to be false by Hastings [Has09].
Later, generalizations and improvements were made in [FKM10, BH10,
FK10, ASW11, Fuk14, BCN13].

Each proof of the above result relies on speciﬁc random counterexam-
ples. The initial counterexamples required the development of highly spe-
ciﬁc counterexamples (tubular neighbourhoods [Has09, FKM10]), whereas
later on, it was realized that there are relation with conceptual tools already
available (Dvoretzky’s theorem [ASW11], large deviation theory [BH10]).
The proofs that achieve the smallest output dimension and the largest
violation rely on free probability theory, and required the development of
speciﬁc tools ([BCN13]). They were speciﬁc to quantum channels obtained
with random Stinespring isometries, and did not work with the initial coun-
terexample of Hastings – random unitary channels.

The purpose of this note is to ﬁll this gap, and explain from a simple con-
ceptual point of view why random unitary channels yield violation, and in
the meantime, obtain an (almost) elementary proof with operator algebras.
The main tool we use is Haagerup’s inequality, which we recall in section
2.3.

2. PRELIMINARY MATERIAL

2.1. Notations of Quantum Information Theory. We denote by H an
Hilbert space, which we assume to be ﬁnite dimensional. B(H) is the set of
bounded linear operators on H, and D(H) ⊂ B(H) is the collection of trace
1, positive operators – known as density matrices.

For X ∈ D(H), its von Neumann entropy is deﬁned by functional calcu-
lus by H(X) = − Tr X log X, where 0 log 0 is assumed by continuity to be
zero.

A quantum channel Φ : B(H1) → B(H2) is a completely positive trace

preserving linear map. The Minimum Output Entropy of Φ is

Hmin(Φ) = min

X∈D(H1)

H(Φ(X)).

We refer to the survey [CN16] for further properties.

2.2. Strong convergence. A ∗-non-commutative tracial probability space
is a pair (A, τ) where A is a unital ∗-algebra, and τ is a positive trace satis-
fying τ(1) = 1.

We say that a sequence of k-tuples (a(n)

i=1 in a sequence of ∗-non-
commutative probability spaces (An, τn), converges in distribution to the
distribution of (a1, . . . , ak) ∈ (A, τ) iff for any free ∗-word w, in k vari-
ables, τn(w(a(n)

i )k

Likewise, a sequence is said to converge strongly in distribution iff it con-
verges in distribution, and in addition, for any non-commutative polynomial
P, its operator norm converges

i )) → τ(w(ai)).

kP(a(n)

1 , . . . , a(n)

k )k → kP(a1, . . . , ak)k.

In this deﬁnition, we assume that the operator norm is given by the distri-
bution, i.e.

where the q-norm kXkq is by deﬁnition (τ((XX∗)q/2))2/q (resp. (τn((XX∗)q/2))2/q)

Let (a(n)

i )k

i=1 be a sequence of n × n matrices, viewed as elements of
the non-commutative probability space (Mn, n−1Tr) and assume that it
converges strongly in distribution towards a k-tuple of random variables
(a1, . . . , ak) ∈ (A, φ), then
Theorem 2.1. Let Un be an n × n Haar distributed unitary random matrix
(independent from (a(n)

i=1). Then the family

i )k

(a(n)

1 , . . . , a(n)

k , Un)

almost surely converges strongly too, towards the k + 2-tuple of random
variables (a1, . . . , ak, u), where u are is a Haar unitary element, free from
(a1, . . . , ak).

Historically, the convergence of distribution is due to Voiculescu, [Voi98].
A simpler proof was given by [C03]. The strong convergence was estab-
lished in [CoMa14], which itself heavily relies on earlier works by [HT05]
and [Mal11].

2.3. Haagerup’s inequality. The following inequality is due to Haagerup
[Haa79] and it plays a crudial role in operator algebra and free probability
theory.

Theorem 2.2. [[Haa79], Lemma 1.4] Let Fk be the free group on k genera-
tors, and let f be a function in l2(Fk) supported on the ﬁnite subspace gen-
erated by words in Fk of length n. We can see it as an element of B(l2(Fk))
and consider its operator norm ||f||. The following holds true:

||f|| ≤ (n + 1)||f||2.

One feature of this note is to show that this Haagerup’s inequality also

plays a crucial role in Quantum Information Theory.

3. MAIN RESULT

We now describe the model that we use to produce a counterexample.

This quantity can be checked to be a norm on Mk(C); as a matter of fact, it
plays a role similar to the t-norm introduced in in [BCN13] in the context
of random quantum channels.

By Theorem 2.1, with probability one on any space of sequences of ran-

dom matrices having the appropriate marginals, we have:

By the Haagerup inequality (Theorem 2.2) the right hand side is bounded
as follows: |||A||| ≤ k−1| Tr A| + 3

traceless matrices,

kqPi6=j |a2

|||A||| ≤

||A||2.

By a standard compactness and continuity argument, the inequality (2)
holds uniformly on any bounded choice of A. We refer for example to
Proposition 7.3 of [CFZ16] for details.

In turn, taking A = Φn(X) − ˜I, we get, with probability one, for any

ε > 0, n large enough,

||Φn,k(X) − ˜I||2

2 = Tr((Φn,k(X) − ˜I)2) ≤ Tr((Φn,k(X) − ˜I)Φn,k(X))
||Φn,k(X) − ˜I||2(1 + ε)

We refer to Equation (18) of [CFZ16] for further detail. Dividing both sides
of the above inequality by ||Φn,k(X) − ˜I||2 implies, that with probability one,

lim sup

||Φn,k(X) − ˜I||2 ≤

which is what we needed.

3.3. Application to violation. We recall the deﬁnition of the conjugate of
the quantum channel Φn,k:

We ﬁrst recall the following

Proposition 3.2. The following holds true

Hmin(Φn,k ⊗ Φn,k) ≤ 2 log k −

log k

k

For the proof, we refer to the original paper by Hastings, or [FKM10],

section 5.1. Second, we quote the following bound:
log k − H(X) ≤ k · Tr(X − ˜I)2

(4)

for X ∈ D(Cn). Here, we refer to [Has09] (see also for example Lemma
2.2 of [Fuk14]). In turn, Equation (4), together with Theorem 3.1 yields the
following

Proposition 3.3.

Hmin(Φ) ≥ log k − 9/k

Therefore, putting things together, we get

Theorem 3.4. With probability one, for n large enough, there is a violation
for the unitary quantum channel, for k large enough.

Proof. According to Proposition 3.2 and Equation (4), we need to ensure
that

2 log k −

< 2(log k −

).

This is equivalent to

log k ≥ 18,

and the inequality will hold as soon as k ≥ e18.

(cid:3)

As a conclusion, let us remark that the bound is not as good as the one
obtained in [BCN13], or many other paper of the bibliography. However,
the only proofs of operator algebraic ﬂavour so far did not allow for random
unitary channels. The primary interest of the proof of this paper is that it
shows that Haagerup’s inequality can be expected to play a more important
role in the study of random quantum channels.

Let us also add that there has been a line of research ([HLSW04, Au09])
where it was proved that randomizing channels in dimension n with k Haar
unitary independent operators sends all states to a density matrix whose
operator norm is less than C/k where C is a universal constant. Although

the previous papers were considering the case where both k, n → ∞, we
focus on the case where only n → ∞ for a ﬁxed value of k. In this case, it

is actually possible to compute precisely the optimal constant, namely, C =
4(k − 1)/k. More importantly, we can give precise information about the
L2-distance to the maximally mixed state. Speciﬁcally, the previous results
(and the triangle inequality) imply that with overwhelming probability, they
remain within L2 distance 9/k of the maximally mixed state. This rules out,
for example, the possibility that many eigenvalues of a mixed state be large
(say, more than 3/k). Such results did not follow from [HLSW04, Au09].
