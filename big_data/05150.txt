Abstract

We consider higher spin operators in weakly coupled gauge conformal ﬁeld theories.
Crossing symmetry of mixed scalar correlators relates diﬀerent higher spin towers and
we study the consequences for the spectrum and structure constants of higher spin
operators of diﬀerent twists. Constraints are obtained to all loops in perturbation
theory. The large spin contributions to the structure constants can be resummed into
a theory-dependent prefactor times a universal factor, whose structure of poles agrees
with the one that would be obtained from a Witten diagram supergravity computation,
although only crossing symmetry is assumed. Finally, our results provide an all loop
expression for the double null limit of mixed correlators, which is in perfect agreement
with the correlator/Wilson loop correspondence.

1 Introduction

The idea of the conformal bootstrap is that by imposing associativity of the operator product
expansion (OPE) for local operators in a unitary conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT) one can derive
constraints for the spectrum and OPE coeﬃcients of the theory [1, 2]. For instance, for a
four-point function crossing symmetry plus the structure of the OPE expansion schematically
implies Fig.1.
In a general CFT in higher dimensions, the interplay between direct and

Figure 1: Crossing symmetry

crossed channels is very complicated: a given operator on one channel will generically map
to a very complicated combination of operators on the other channel. The essence of the
analytic conformal bootstrap is that for certain operators this map is much simpler. For
example, each higher dimensional CFT, strongly [3,4] or weakly [5] coupled possesses double
trace higher spin operators which map to the identity operator in the dual channel.
In
this paper we will concentrate on conformal weakly coupled gauge theories. These theories
contain towers of higher spin operators, with small anomalous dimensions, which under
crossing, and for high values of the spin, map to each other [5, 6]:

HSτ ↔ HSτ

where τ denotes the twist (dimension minus the spin) of the higher spin tower. In [6] we
focused in a four-dimensional CFT, external operators of the form O[2] = T rϕ2 and single-
trace higher spin operators of the schematic form O(cid:96) = T rϕ∂(cid:96)ϕ, with twist two and spin (cid:96).
In perturbation theory these operators have a small anomalous dimension:

It turns out crossing symmetry is powerful enough to ﬁx the behaviour of the anomalous
dimension for large values of the spin

∆ = (cid:96) + 2 + γ(cid:96)

together with the OPE coeﬃcient of O(cid:96) with two external operators

γ(cid:96) ∼ f (g) log (cid:96)

C22(cid:96) ∼ Γ(cid:16)1 −

On [6] we have focused on correlators of identical operators. In the present paper we
will consider mixed correlators and show that (1) is a particular example of a more general
relation, in which two diﬀerent towers of higher spin operators map to each other

HSτ ↔ HSτ(cid:48)

Analysing the consequences of crossing in this case is more delicate, since higher spin oper-
ators with more than two constituent ﬁelds are highly degenerate. For τ > 2 we ﬁnd that
again crossing implies a logarithmic growing for the anomalous dimensions, but this time in
the sense of a weighted average (to be deﬁned below). Furthermore, crossing symmetry ﬁxes
the large spin behaviour of the OPE coeﬃcient between two scalar operators and a higher
spin operator. More precisely, we obtain the following universal behaviour

(3)

(4)

Cpq(cid:96) ∼ Γ(cid:18)∆p + ∆q − τ(cid:96)

(cid:19)

for several families of operators, as will be speciﬁed below. This is a natural generalisation of
(2). Furthermore, note that the same structure of poles would appear in a Witten diagram
supergravity computation of the three-point function for operators of dimensions ∆p, ∆q and
τ(cid:96), see for instance [7–9]. However, our result arises from crossing symmetry alone, without
assuming large N or large R−charges, and is a all-loop result!

Having solved for the structure constants of higher spin operators we can study the mixed
correlators under consideration in the double null limit. Our results are in perfect agreement
with the picture of [12].

This paper is organised as follows. In the next section we show that crossing symmetry
for mixed correlators leads to relations among diﬀerent higher spin towers. In section three
we derive integral relations arising from crossing symmetry for mixed correlators. Although
the method is very general, we apply it to a simple model for deﬁniteness. We then show how
to solve such integral relations, ﬁnding constraints, to all loops in perturbation theory, for
the spectrum of higher spin operators and OPE coeﬃcients of the theory. As an interesting
application, we compute the double null limit of the correlators under consideration and
compare our results to [12]. In section (4) we study in detail the case of weakly coupled
N = 4 SYM. In this case the theory possesses a global R−symmetry and crossing symmetry
acts on the representations of this symmetry as well. By considering appropriate projections
we show that the equations in this case exactly reduce to the equations previously found.
We end up with a discussion of our results. Several technical details, needed in the body of
the paper, are deferred to the appendices.

2 Crossing symmetry and higher spin towers

2.1 Crossing for mixed scalar operators and higher spin towers

Let us start with a discussion of crossing relations for the most general scalar case. This was
done for instance in [10]. For four arbitrary scalar operators we can write, see [11]

where ∆ij = ∆i − ∆j and we have introduce the conformal cross-ratios

The full correlation function must be invariant under the exchange (1, i) ↔ (3, k), which

gives the crossing equation

The function Gijkl(u, v) can be decomposed in terms of conformal blocks as

Gijkl(u, v) =(cid:88)O

cijOcklOg∆ij ,∆kl

∆,(cid:96)

(u, v)

where O runs over all conformal primary operators present in the corresponding OPE and
∆, (cid:96) denote the dimension and spin of such operators. The crossing equation implies

(v, u)

(9)

This is a very complicated (but powerful!) equation, as usually single operators on one
channel, are mapped to inﬁnite, complicated combinations on the other channel. The essence
of the analytic bootstrap is that:

1.- Certain towers of higher spin operators map to simple operators on the other channel:

either to isolated operators of low twist [3, 4] or to themselves [5, 6].

2.- One can access this regime by considering a light-cone OPE of the four-point correlator.

This allows to compute certain features of the spectrum and OPE coeﬃcients of higher
spin operators exactly. The simplest example arises for identical external operators with
dimension ∆0. In this case the crossing relation reads

v∆0(cid:88)O

cijOcklOg∆,(cid:96)(u, v) = u∆0(cid:88)O

ckjOcilOg∆,(cid:96)(v, u)

(10)

3

where we have introduced g∆,(cid:96)(u, v) = g0,0
∆,(cid:96)(u, v). In conformal weakly coupled gauge theories
there are towers of almost conserved higher spin currents of twist τ = ∆ − (cid:96) = ∆0 + γ(cid:96). In
such a situation the crossing relation (10) maps the large spin sector of the higher spin tower
HSτ to itself 1

This phenomenon was exploited in [5, 6] to ﬁnd information about the spectrum and OPE
coeﬃcients of higher spin operators. Considering instead mixed correlators we see that this
is a special case of a more general relation

HSτ ↔ HSτ

(11)

(12)
Indeed, consider the contribution to Gijkl(u, v) from operators with twist τ : Gijkl(u, v)|τ =
uτ /2h(v). If h(v) diverges as v → 0

HSτ ↔ HSτ(cid:48)

Gijkl(u, v)|HSτ ∼

uτ /2
vα

(13)

then such a divergence must come from a tower of higher spin operators, of approximate
twist τ . Under crossing this term maps in the dual channel to a term of the form vτ(cid:48)/2
uβ with

∆j +∆k

(14)

Provided β > 0 this must correspond to an inﬁnite tower of higher spin operators HSτ(cid:48).
Hence crossing leads to the relation (12). Studying diﬀerent mixed correlators will lead to
diﬀerent constraints involving towers of higher spin operators. Below we will study such
constraints in detail, but before let us discuss the properties of diﬀerent higher spin towers.

2.2 Towers of higher spin operators

Although the methods which we will apply in this paper are completely general, we will
discuss a speciﬁc model for deﬁniteness. Then in section 4 we will focus in a diﬀerent model
and show that the ﬁnal relation has exactly the same form. Let us consider a conformal
weakly coupled gauge theory in four dimensions, with a scalar ﬁeld ϕ. The simplest gauge
invariant operators are traces of such a scalar ﬁeld and its derivatives. Below we will discuss
the towers of higher spin operators that can arise in the light-cone OPE of scalar operators
formed only by scalar ﬁelds.

1Sometimes by ”twist τ ” we will refer to the twist at zero coupling, so that the real twist of the operators
is approximately τ . This is commonly done when dealing with weakly coupled gauge theory. We hope this
does not confuse the reader.

Twist 2

These are operators of the form O(2)
(cid:96) = T rϕ∂(cid:96)ϕ + ··· where the derivatives are along a null
direction. There is only one primary operator for each even spin and none with spin odd 2.
We denote such a tower by HS2. These operators are also called leading-twist operators and
their anomalous dimension grows logarithmically with the spin:

where we have deﬁned the coupling constant g as the coeﬃcient in front of the logarithmic
piece. All other quantities will be expressed in terms of this g.

γ(2)
(cid:96) = g log (cid:96) + b(g) + ···

(15)

Twist 3

These are operators of the form O(3)
I,(cid:96) = T rϕ2∂(cid:96)ϕ + ··· . For both, spin odd and even, there
is a degeneracy of primary operators, see appendix C. We denote this tower by HS3. Again,
their anomalous dimension grows logarithmically with the spin, but they grow along a band,
as described in [13]. More precisely, for large spin

gρI log (cid:96) + ··· ≤ γ(3)

I,(cid:96) ≤ 2gρI log (cid:96) + ···

(16)

Twist 4

operators of the form O(4)

For twist four and higher we have a new ingredient. On one hand, there are single-trace
I,(cid:96) = T rϕ3∂(cid:96)ϕ + ··· . There are primary operators for both, spin
odd and even. Their anomalous dimension grows logarithmically with the spin, again along
a band, schematically

γ(4)
I,(cid:96) = gρI log (cid:96) + ···

(17)
where now 1 ≤ ρI ≤ 3. In addition, there are double trace operators, of the form [O(2),O(2)](cid:96) =
O(2)
, with (cid:96)1 + (cid:96)2 + (cid:96)3 = (cid:96). For large (cid:96)1 + (cid:96)3 (a macroscopic fraction of (cid:96)) their anoma-
lous dimension again grows logarithmically with the spin. The discussion in [17] and a naive
application of the results of [3, 4] would imply an anomalous dimension of the form

(cid:96)1

∂(cid:96)2O(2)

(cid:96)3

γ(4)
DT,(cid:96) ∼ g (log (cid:96)1 + log (cid:96)3) + ···

(18)

While the regime considered in this paper is not in the range of validity [3,4], the ideas of [17]
still apply and we expect this expansion to be true. The main diﬀerence with the single trace
case is that there are operators with very large spin whose anomalous dimension does not
grow logarithmically, the ones with small (cid:96)1, (cid:96)3. Of course, in a non-planar theory there is

2In theories with other ﬁelds it is possible to form twist two operators with gauge bosons and fermions.
In the presence of R−symmetry one can often choose a projection such that only twist-two operators made
up of scalars contribute.

5

really no distinction between single and multi-trace operators, but the behaviour with spin
will have the same features: for most operators it will grow logarithmically but there will
be some operators for which it wont. We denote the full contribution of all operators HS4
and the results of this paper will still apply. Higher twists behave in a similar way, except
in general we can also have triple trace, etc.

3 Consequences of crossing symmetry

Although our methods will be general, we will focus for deﬁniteness on a speciﬁc model. We
consider a conformal weakly coupled gauge theory in four dimensions and external operators
of the form

with dimension ∆ = L at tree level. We will assume for simplicity that such operators are
protected. Furthermore we denote by GL1L2L3L4(u, v) the conformal invariant part of the
correlator

AL = T rϕL

(19)

(cid:104)AL1(x1)AL2(x2)AL3(x3)AL4(x4)(cid:105)

We will start by considering the simplest case of four identical operators with L = 2. This
will serve to introduce some important ingredients. Then we will proceed to discuss a more
general case.

3.1 Integral relations

Correlator G2222(u, v)

Let us start by the simplest case G2222(u, v). At tree-level we obtain

G2222(u, v) = 1 + u(cid:16)c11

v

+ c10(cid:17) + u2(cid:16)c22

v2 +

c21
v

+ c20(cid:17)

The constants cij will in general depend on the parameters of the theory, e.g.
its central
charge, but their explicit form will not be relevant for us. When the coupling constant is
turned on these coeﬃcients get dressed by logarithms, and to any order in perturbation
theory

(20)

(21)

cij → cij(log u, log v)

where the function cij(log u, log v) is by deﬁnition the function in front of ui
vj in a small u, v
expansion, see [5]. From the structure of divergences, and the powers of u, the contribution
c11 must come from the exchange of an inﬁnite tower of higher spin operators with twist two,
or HS2. Furthermore c22 arises solely from the tower HS4, while c21 may receive contributions

6

from both, twist four operators as well as descendants of twist two operators, see appendix
A. What do these towers map to under crossing? Crossing symmetry implies

v2G2222(u, v) = u2G2222(v, u)

(22)

We see c22 gets mapped to the contribution from the identity operator. This is an example
of the phenomenon studied in [3,4]. Furthermore, the contribution c11 maps to itself, so that
this corresponds to

HS2 ↔ HS2

More precisely, crossing symmetry implies c11(log u, log v) = c11(log v, log u).
In order to
study the consequences of this relation let us follow [6] and consider both ways of decomposing
c11:

G2222(u, v)|HS2

= u

G2222(v, u)|HS2

(28)
where in ˆa((cid:96)) and γ(2)((cid:96)) only the contributions that do not vanish at large spin are kept.
This integral relation imposes conditions on both, the spectrum and the OPE coeﬃcients.
More precisely, at large spin [6]:

γ(2)
(cid:96)

= g log (cid:96) + b(g) + ···

ˆa((cid:96)) = κ(g)2−γ(2)

(cid:96) e−b(g) log (cid:96)Γ2(cid:32)1 −

These results are valid to all loops in perturbation theory. Namely, to all orders in g in the
regime g log (cid:96) (cid:28) 1, although they resum all perturbative corrections.

Correlator Gppqq(u, v)

Let us study the correlator Gppqq(u, v) and its permutations, the most relevant case for
this paper. In this case there are two distinct crossing relations and they provide diﬀerent
information. Let us start by computing at zero coupling

Gppqq(u, v) = 1 +

, with τ = 2, 4,··· , 2 min(p, q). From the point of view of the direct channel (30) these
c τ
can only arise from higher spin towers HSτ . Indeed, descendants of lower twist higher spin
towers will not produce a divergent enough term, see appendix A. From the point of view
of the dual channel (31) these can only arise from higher spin towers HSp+q−τ , for the same
reason. Hence, crossing relates

which generalises (23). Let us proceed as above and consider the OPE decomposition of c τ

For a ﬁxed (cid:96), the index I labels diﬀerent operators which are degenerate at tree level. Twist
two is the only non-degenerate case. The next step is to convert this relation into an integral
equation. This is a bit more subtle than before, as for each spin we have a degeneracy at
tree-level. In order to reproduce the correct divergence at tree level we must have

Two comments are in order. First, in the above equation we keep only terms that are not
suppressed by powers of the spin in the large spin expansions of γ((cid:96)) and ˆa((cid:96)) on both sides.
Second, we have chosen a normalization such that in perturbation theory

ˆa(τ ) = 1 + ··· ,

ˆa(p+q−τ ) = 1 + ···

(41)

Once a solution is found, we can always multiply both sides by a function of the coupling
constant, and the resulting OPE coeﬃcients will still be a solution. Relation (40) imposes
non-trivial constraints on the spectrum and OPE coeﬃcients. It turns out these constraints

Below we will explicitly consider the constraints arising from this relation and comment
on the general case. Before that, however, let us comment on the other crossing relation.

However, there is a crucial diﬀerence with the previous case. According to the results of
appendix B:

HS|q−p|+2m ↔ HSp+q−2m

cpq(cid:96)cpq(cid:96) =

(cid:96)p+q−2m−3/2

(45)

(cid:88)I

so that the leading divergence as v → 0 does not arise from the leading behaviour of the
OPE coeﬃcients but rather from a subleading term, which does not contain (−1)(cid:96). The
consequences of this are that if we were to deﬁne ˆa((cid:96)) as above, not only the leading term

10

would contribute, but also terms which are suppressed in the large spin limit, provided
they contain an additional (−1)(cid:96). The same will happen with the anomalous dimension
contributions. For this reason, in the following we will focus on relations (40) and (42).

3.2 Solving the integral equation

As we have seen, relation (28) implies a logarithmic behaviour for the anomalous dimension
of twist-two operators and ﬁxes completely the large spin behaviour of the OPE coeﬃcients,
both results valid to all loops in perturbation theory. In the following we would like to work
out the implications of (42).

First, note that at tree-level (cid:104)...(cid:105) = 1, ˆa = 1, and all anomalous dimensions vanish so
that the integral relation is satisﬁed. As we turn on the coupling it follows that the average
anomalous dimensions for twist p+q−2 operators can have at most a logarithmic behaviour,
very much as for the twist two case. So that

(cid:104)γ(p+q−2)((cid:96))(cid:105) = (cid:104)ρ(cid:105) log (cid:96) + (cid:104)β(cid:105) + ··· ,
(cid:104)(cid:0)γ(p+q−2)((cid:96))(cid:1)2

(cid:105) = (cid:104)ρ2(cid:105) log2 (cid:96) + 2(cid:104)ρβ(cid:105) log (cid:96) + (cid:104)β2(cid:105) + ··· ,

(46)

(47)

and so on. This is consistent with the analysis of [13]. Note that due to degeneracy in general
(cid:104)γ2(cid:105) (cid:54)= (cid:104)γ(cid:105)2. Each of the quantities of the r.h.s. will have a coupling constant dependence,
so that

ρ = ρ1g + ρ2g2 + ···
β = β1g + β2g2 + ···

(48)

(49)

This is to be supplemented with the known behaviour for the anomalous dimension of twist
two operators. Crossing symmetry implies a similar logarithmic behaviour for the average
of the OPE coeﬃcients:

ˆa(2)((cid:96)) = 1 + g(a10 + a11 log (cid:96)) + g2(a20 + a21 log (cid:96) + a22 log2 (cid:96)) + ···

ˆa(p+q−2)((cid:96)) = 1 + g(a(pq)

10 + a(pq)

11

log (cid:96)) + g2(a(pq)

20 + a(pq)

21

log (cid:96) + a(pq)
22

(50)

(51)

log2 (cid:96)) + ···

We could insert all the corresponding expansions into (42), expand order by order in pertur-
bation theory and work out the corresponding constraints. We can also proceed in a more
systematic way. First rewrite the integral equation as

(cid:90) ∞

with the following logarithmic behaviour for the anomalous dimensions:

γ(2)((cid:96)) = g log (cid:96) + b,

Then introduce the following integral representations:

(cid:104)(γ(p+q−2))n(cid:105) = (cid:104)(ρ log (cid:96) + β)n(cid:105).
ˆa(2)(cid:16) x√
ˆa(p+q−2)(cid:16) y√

v(cid:17) =(cid:90) F (2)(y, x√

v )Kp−q(2y)dy

u)K0(2x)dx

(53)

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

(58)

Plugging this into (52) we obtain an equation of the form

(cid:90) PL(x, y, u, v)K0(2x)Kp−q(2y)dxdy =(cid:90) PR(x, y, u, v)K0(2x)Kp−q(2y)dxdy

where PL and PR have a very speciﬁc form. It turns out that to any order in perturbation
theory the Kernel K0(2x)Kp−q(2y) is such that the above equation actually implies PL = PR.
It turns out this implies the following remarkable property for the average of the spectrum:

and furthermore

(cid:104)ρn(cid:105) = (cid:104)ρ(cid:105)n,

(cid:104)ρmβn(cid:105) = (cid:104)ρ(cid:105)m(cid:104)βn(cid:105)

(cid:104)ρ(cid:105) = g

So that to any order in perturbation theory the leading logarithmic behaviour of the averaged
anomalous dimension of the p + q − 2 higher spin operator behaves as if there were no
degeneracy and equals the anomalous dimension of twist two operators! This is not in
contradiction with [13], since here we are only talking about a weighted average and in the
limit of large spin. Furthermore, crossing also ﬁxes

F (2)(x, ζ) = α2−g log ζ−b+βxp+q−3−b−g log ζζ−β
F (pq)(x, ζ) = α2−g log ζx1−β−g log ζζ−b

(59)

(60)

with the understanding that powers of β are to be understood in an averaged sense 4. α is
an arbitrary function of the coupling constant (not ﬁxed by crossing) but independent of the
spin. Plugging this back into the integral representations (55) we obtain

ˆa(2)((cid:96)) = α(g)2−g log ζ−b+β(cid:96)−βΓ(cid:18)p − 1 −
ˆa(p+q−2)((cid:96)) = α(g)2−g log ζ(cid:96)−bΓ(cid:18)1 −

12

where γ(p+q−2)((cid:96)) = g log (cid:96) + β and again, powers of β (which arise when expanding the
expression above) are to be understood in a averaged sense. Two comments are in order.
First recall a(2)((cid:96)) arose from a factorised OPE coeﬃcient cppO(2)
, so that the factor
(cid:104)(cid:96)−β(cid:105) should factorize accordingly, namely (cid:104)(cid:96)−β(cid:105) = f (p)f (q). Furthermore note that the rest

of the answer factorises as well. Second, note that from our answer we can read oﬀ the
following universal behaviour at large spin

Up to a prefactor which depends on the details of the theory. The result for ˆa(p+q−2)((cid:96))
has a similar universal behaviour (but in this case ˆa(p+q−2)((cid:96)) is itself a sum over many
contributions), namely

(63)

cpqO(p+q−2)

(cid:96)

∼ Γ(cid:18)1 −

2

γ(p+q−2)((cid:96))(cid:19)

The universal behaviour we have found can be summarised as follows. The OPE coeﬃcient
between two scalar operators of weights ∆p and ∆q and a higher spin operator of (tree-level)
twist τ has the universal behaviour

(cid:96) ∼ Γ(cid:32)∆p + ∆q − τ − γ(τ )

2

(cid:96)

cpqO(τ )

(cid:33)

(65)

where averages should be understood where it corresponds. This behaviour is also consistent
with the most general relation (40), but in this case the prefactor is more complicated.
This structure is very reminiscent of the result one would obtain from Witten’s diagrams
in supergravity. However, in the present paper we have only analysed the consequences of
crossing, without any further assumptions.

3.3 Comparison to polygonal Wilson loops

The consecutive null limit x2
i,i+1 → 0 of correlators in conformal gauge theories was studied
in [12].
In this limit there are fast particles propagating between consecutive points and
the correlator should reduce to the expectation value of a polygonal Wilson loop. For the
particular case of a four-point function this limit coincides with the double null limit where
u, v → 0 at the same rate. It was argued in [12] (see section 4 of that paper) that in this
limit we should obtain

lim
u,v→0

Gconn
Gtree

conn ∼ e− Γcusp

4

log u log v+ b1

2 log u+ b2

2 log vJ(u, v)

(66)

where G denotes the full correlator (not only its conformal invariant part) and we focus on
a given connected contribution, so that the fast particles can frame the Wilson loop, and
divide by the corresponding connected piece at tree level. The result (66) can be better

13

understood by choosing coordinates where the insertion points are at the vertices of a large
rectangle with sides ∆τ ≈ −1/2 log u and ∆σ ≈ −1/2 log v, see ﬁgure 2.

Figure 2: As consecutive insertion points become null separated in space-time they form a
rectangle (A, B, C, D) in the (σ, τ ) coordinates.

As we approach the double null limit we have a fast moving particle going between the
diﬀerent vertices of the polygon. Since this particle is coloured, it sources a colour electric
ﬁeld which is extended on the rectangle (green area in ﬁg. 2). This colour electric ﬂux
has constant energy density in the (τ, σ) plane, proportional to Γcusp, and this produces the
leading divergence in the exponential in (66), proportional to the area of the rectangle. In the
interacting theory the particles can interact with the ﬂux, and there are further terms. The
simplest contribution arises due to corrections to the energies of the propagating particles.
These corrections are conﬁned to the edge of the rectangle (red lines in ﬁg. 2) and give rise
to the subleading divergences in the exponential in (66), proportional to the perimeter of
rectangle. Finally, the factor J(u, v) arises from the fact that the particles are coloured so
we can have a back reaction of the colour electric ﬁeld on the propagation of the particles.
Although this is in general a complicated factor some features were studied in [12].

In the present paper we have computed the structure constants of higher spin operators
with leading twist. In particular, these operators dominate the correlator in the small u, v
limit. Consider the correlator Gppqq above. In the small u, v limit, with their ration ﬁxed, only
the functions cii will survive. Each function corresponds to a diﬀerent connected contribution.
In particular, let us consider c11 which corresponds to

(cid:104)Ap(x1)Ap(x2)Aq(x3)Aq(x4)(cid:105) =
Plugging (61) back into the l.h.s. of (42) we obtain

c11 ∼ e− g

4 log u log v+ b

2 log u+ β

(68)
Recall that in our conventions Γcusp ≡ g. Hence, our result exactly agrees with (66)! Fur-
thermore note that from the point of view of the picture in [12] β in the exponent in (68)
arises from corrections to the energy of the particle going from A to B plus corrections to
the energy of the particle going from D to C. For the present case the ﬁrst correction should
depend only on p, while the second should depend only on q, leading to a factorised depen-

dence, in agreement with the comment below (61-62). Finally, crossing symmetry provides
an all loop expression for the factor J(u, v):

J(u, v) =(cid:90) ∞

0

dxdyx1−β+ g

2 log uyp+q−3−b+ g

2 log ve−g log x log yK0(2x)Kp−q(2y)

(69)

where powers of β should be understood as averages. This answer satisﬁes all the general
properties for J(u, v) discussed in [12]. Other terms cii will behave similarly . Hence, our
results are in perfect agreement with the correspondence proposed in [12].

4 A case with global charge: N = 4 SYM

In the simple model studied above we have ignored two important features. On one hand, a
generic gauge CFT contains fermions and gauge bosons in addition to scalars. As a result,
there will be higher spin operators also formed by non-scalar letters. In particular, some
of these will have the same quantum numbers as the higher spin operators studied above,
increasing the degeneracy. On the other hand, gauge theories can posses global symmetries,
such that scalars and fermions are charged under this global symmetry. Projecting in diﬀerent
representations may split a priori degenerate higher spin operators. In the following we will
see how the picture introduced in sections 2 and 3 works for the particular example of N = 4
SYM.

4.1 Higher spin towers in N = 4 SYM
Four-dimensional N = 4 SYM posses a global SU (4)R R−symmetry group. Gauge invariant
operators are formed by traces of the fundamental ﬁelds of the theory: Scalar ﬁelds ϕI in
α and ¯λA ˙α, in the 4 and ¯4 of SU (4)R and gauge bosons
the 6 of SU (4)R; fermionic ﬁelds λA
Aµ in the singlet representation; together with their derivatives. We can form the following
higher spin operators of spin (cid:96), classiﬁed by their twist and SU (4) representation:

Twist 2

• T rϕ∂µ1 ··· ∂µ(cid:96)ϕ, transforming in the 6 × 6 = 1 + 15 + 20(cid:48).

• T r¯λΓµ∂µ2 ··· ∂µ(cid:96)λ, transforming in the 4 × ¯4 = 1 + 15.

• T rFνµ1∂µ2 ··· ∂µ(cid:96)−1F ν

µ(cid:96)

, transforming in the 1 × 1 = 1

As a result, we can consider diﬀerent towers HSR
scalars so that it is still non-degenerate.

2 . Note that HS20(cid:48)

2

can only be formed by

15

Twist 3

• T rϕϕ∂µ1 ··· ∂µ(cid:96)ϕ, transforming in the 6 × 6 × 6 = 3 × 6 + 10 + ¯10 + 50 + 2 × 64.

• T rϕ¯λΓµ∂µ2 ··· ∂µ(cid:96)λ, transforming in the 6 × 4 × ¯4 = 2 × 6 + 10 + ¯10 + 64.

• T rϕFνµ1∂µ2 ··· ∂µ(cid:96)−1F ν

µ(cid:96)

, transforming in the 6 × 1 × 1 = 6

Again, note that HS50
3

can only be made by scalars.

Twist p

A similar analysis can be performed for higher and higher twists, with a richer and richer
structure. The upshot is that the representation with Dynkin labels [0p0] and hence HS[0p0]
can only be obtained from scalars. In particular 20(cid:48) and 50 correspond to [020] and [030]
respectively.

p

4.2 Crossing symmetry in N = 4 SYM
In four dimensional N = 4 SYM there is a class of half-BPS superconformal primary opera-
tors, transforming in the [0, p, 0] of SU (4)R and with protected dimension ∆ = p. They are
given by

O[p](x, t) = tr1 . . . trpT r(ϕr1 . . . ϕrp)(x)

(70)
where ri = 1,··· , 6 and t is a complex six dimensional null vector which encodes the R-
symmetry structure. Superconformal symmetry ﬁxes the structure of the four point function
of such operators to be of the form [14]

(cid:104)O[p1](x1, t1)O[p2](x2, t2)O[p3](x3, t3)O[p4](x4, t4)(cid:105)

τ =

t1 · t3 t2 · t4

(72)

Such correlator can be decomposed into (p1+1)(p1+2)
terms, accordingly to the diﬀerent SU (4)R
representation present in the OPE of [0, p1, 0]× [0, p2, 0] ⊂ [0, p3, 0]× [0, p4, 0], where without
loss of generality we assume that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ p4. Each contribution, labelled by

It is easy to see from (77) that diﬀerent SU (4)R representations will in general mix under
crossing, and a given representation in the left hand side will map into a linear combination
of all the possible representations on the right hand side. Notice however that the number of
possible representations appearing on both sides of (77) is the same and given by (p+1)(p+2)
where p is the smallest among the pi.

2

We would like to repeat the exercise of sections 2 and 3 for this case. In this setting
we are considering the correlators Gppqq and Gqppq, where for the rest of the discussion we
assume p ≤ q. If we consider the small u limit of Gppqq(u, v, σ, τ ) the leading contribution
(besides that of the identity operator) arises from twist two operators. As discussed above
they can transform only in three SU (4)R representations, which in our conventions we denote
by (0, 0), (1, 1) and (1, 0). Furthermore, we would like to focus in the leading divergence as
v goes to zero. We obtain

and they can be expanded in collinear conformal blocks as in (73). As previously discussed,
the representation (1, 1) is the only one which is non-degenerate and contains only operators
built from scalars.5 As a consequence of crossing symmetry we can write

SU (4)R representations, namely

where R = [n − m, q − p + 2m, n − m], for 0 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ p − 1. So that for each of these
representations we obtain a relation exactly as (42).

In [15], the four point function of half-BPS operators of arbitrary dimensions have been
computed in planar N = 4 SYM up to three loops. The simplest example with p (cid:54)= q
corresponds to the correlator G2233(u, v, σ, τ ), so lets list the results for this case. By pro-
jecting this four point function in the 20’ representation, one can perform the conformal
as well as γ(1,1)((cid:96)), up to two loops in
partial wave expansion and extract c22O(1,1)
perturbation theory. Using the notation of (50) we obtain

Now using the crossing relations (42) it is possible to compute the coeﬃcients (cid:104)β(cid:105) and (cid:104)β2(cid:105)
appearing in the expansions (46) of the weighted averages of anomalous dimension of twist-3
operators for any of the three possible representation of SU (4)R:

5In principle the equation for representation diﬀerent than (1, 1) are the same but harder to solve and

they will involve weighted averages also on the direct channel.

where γe is Euler Gamma constant. As expected from unitarity, (cid:104)β2(cid:105) > (cid:104)β(cid:105)2.

We can also obtain results for general p, q. As noticed in [15,16], three point functions of
cp1p2(cid:96) properly normalised are all equal at one loop since there is only one structure at this
loop order. This allows computing (cid:104)β(cid:105) for generic p, q giving

(cid:104)β(cid:105) = −

(ψ0 (p − 1) + ψ0 (q − 1)) g + ···

(87)

where ψ0 denotes the digamma function. Note that for p = q = 2 this agrees with the ﬁnite
piece of the anomalous dimension of twist two operators in the large spin limit, while for
p = 2, q = 3 it agrees with the result given above. Furthermore, it displays the factorised
structure discussed section 3.

5 Conclusions

In the present paper we have studied weakly coupled conformal gauge theories by analytic
bootstrap techniques. Weakly coupled gauge theories contain towers of higher spin operators
of approximate twist τ . By studying crossing symmetry for mixed correlators we have found
that these towers (for large values of the spin) map to each other:

HSτ ↔ HSτ(cid:48)

This relation takes the form of an integral equation involving the spectrum and structure
constants of the higher spin operators. In case of twists higher than two, such operators are
degenerate and the integral relation involves weighted averages. Regarding the spectrum, we
have found that crossing symmetry is consistent with a logarithmic behaviour, in agreement
with [13]. Regarding the structure constants our results take the form

cpqO(τ )

(cid:96)

= f (τ )

pq ((cid:96)) × Γ(cid:32)∆p + ∆q − τ − γ(τ )

2

(cid:96)

(cid:33)

Namely, a universal factor times a theory-dependent prefactor f (τ )
pq ((cid:96)). The universal factor
has a very similar structure to the one that arises when studying Witten diagrams.
In
particular, it includes a series of poles that start when the full twist of the higher spin
operator equals the sum of the dimensions of the other two.
In the context of large N
MSYM the appearance of analogous poles was analysed in [9, 19] and where it was shown to
be related to operator mixing. Although our results are in principle only valid in perturbation
theory (but to all loops), given the discussions in [9, 19] we expect this structure to persist
for ﬁnite γ(cid:96), at least in the planar limit. It is very interesting this structure arises naturally
by only requiring crossing symmetry. The theory-dependent prefactor, of the schematic
form f = (cid:96)−β, depends on the theory under consideration and on averages that are hard
to calculate. For the simplest case this prefactor is basically f = (cid:96)−b, where b is the sub-
leading/ﬁnite contribution to the anomalous dimension of twist two operators. In this case

19

it does not add any new analytic structure to the answer, and we expect this to be the case
in general.

Having solved for the constraints above one can then compute the mixed correlators under
consideration in the double null limit. This limit was studied in [12] where it was shown
that the expectation value of a polygonal Wilson loop should be recovered. Our results are
in perfect agreement with these expectation and furthermore they provide all loop results
for certain prefactors that are in general hard to compute.

Some open problems which we consider interesting are the following. The present paper
generalises the results of [6] to external operators with arbitrary dimension. This opens
up the possibility to compare our results with results at strong coupling, since now we can
consider ∆p and ∆q large. It would be very interesting to make a detailed comparison to the
results of [9] from string vertices. This may also allow to get a handle on the prefactor f (τ )
pq ((cid:96))
at strong coupling, ideally to compute it exactly. Regarding this, note that for N = 4SY M
the explicit one-loop result (87) grows logarithmically as p or q becomes large. As a result
(cid:96)β becomes symmetric under p ↔ (cid:96). It would be interesting to understand this result.

It would be interesting to explore further the relation to Wilson loops and the picture
of [12]. The present paper oﬀers a proof of the correlators/Wilson loop correspondence
from crossing symmetry, for the four-dimensional case and gives explicit expressions for
all ingredients involved. Can we learn more from this interplay? A related question is to
understand our results, and in particular the structure of poles in the universal factor, along
the lines of [12,17]. This may provide a ﬁnite coupling understanding of the universal factor.

Over the last years there has been progress in the computation of structure constants in
planar N = 4SY M by integrability techniques. See for instance [20] for the state of the art.
Despite these developments, there are still missing ingredients if one wants to pursue the
program to all loops. The present results may be useful in such endeavours. On one hand,
the structures found in this paper should be visible in other approaches. Furthermore, the
fact that the results of this paper are valid for any length of the external operators means
that certain subtleties, such as wrapping, can be pushed away.

It would also be interesting to apply these techniques to other weakly coupled gauge

conformal ﬁeld theories. An interesting example would be β−deformed N = 4 SYM.

Finally, for theories with gravity dual (known or unknown) an interesting question is
how much of the structure of the gravity dual can be understood from symmetries of CFT
correlators. Or conversely, which CFT theories can admit a gravity dual. There has been a
lot of activity in this regard, see for instance [21] for early results in this direction and [22]
for a diﬀerent approach. It is remarkable that our results reproduce the pole structure of
Witten diagrams. One may wonder if this would lead to a way to deﬁne constructively the
would be gravity dual of our CFT’s.

A Divergent contributions from HS towers

In this appendix we present the leading divergence, as v → 0, due to the exchange of higher
spin operators in the direct channel, for various situations that we describe. The results
below are heavily used in the body of the paper. The small u limit of the scalar conformal
block is given by, see e.g. [11].

g∆ij ,∆kl
∆,(cid:96)

(u, v) = u

∆−(cid:96)
2 f ∆ij ,∆kl

coll (∆,(cid:96))(v)

where the collinear part of the conformal block is given by

f ∆ij ,∆kl

∆kl, ∆ + (cid:96); 1 − v(cid:19)

This result holds in general dimensions. Note that we are using conventions where we do
not include an extra (−1)(cid:96) factor in the conformal block. We are interested in computing
the divergent contribution as v → 0 of the following sum

where ∆ = ∆0 + (cid:96) + γ(cid:96) and

a(cid:96)f ∆ij ,∆kl

coll (∆,(cid:96))(v)

(cid:88)(cid:96)

a(cid:96) =

(cid:96)κ
4(cid:96) + ···

(89)

As discussed in [3, 4, 12] the divergence arises from the large (cid:96) region and can be captured

by focusing in the small v/large (cid:96) region. More precisely, we take v → 0 keeping x = (cid:96)√v

ﬁxed. In this limit the sum over (cid:96) becomes an integral over x and we obtain

(cid:96)κ
4(cid:96) f ∆ij ,∆kl

coll (∆0+γ(cid:96)+(cid:96),(cid:96))(v) =

(cid:88)(cid:96)∈2Z

In the above expression we have assumed the sum runs over even spins only, which is the
case, for instance, if we have identical external operators. In general we can have a sum over
all spins. In this case:

(cid:96)κ
4(cid:96) f ∆ij ,∆kl

coll (∆0+γ(cid:96)+(cid:96),(cid:96))(v) =

(cid:88)(cid:96)∈Z

0

dxxκ+ 1

2

2∆0+γ
√π

K ∆kl−∆ij

2

(2x) + ···

(91)

In some cases odd spins contribute with a negative factor respect to even spins. In such case
we do not get a divergent contribution. In other words

(cid:88)(cid:96)
(−1)(cid:96) (cid:96)κ

4(cid:96) f ∆ij ,∆kl

coll (∆0+γ(cid:96)+(cid:96),(cid:96))(v) ∼ 1

(92)

The results above are useful to compute the leading contribution from a given tower of
higher spin operators. We may be interested in computing the divergent contribution due to
descendants of these operators. In order to compute this we ﬁrst need subleading corrections
to collinear conformal blocks:

g∆ij ,∆kl
∆,(cid:96)

(u, v) = u

∆−(cid:96)
2 f ∆ij ,∆kl

coll (∆,(cid:96))(v) + u

∆−(cid:96)
2 +1f ∆ij ,∆kl

subcoll (∆,(cid:96))(v) + ···

(93)

These corrections have been computed in [18] for identical external operators, in arbitrary
dimensions, and for the particular case d = 4 can be extracted from the known result for the
scalar conformal blocks. The main result to be used in the body of the paper is that for all
these cases the divergence due to descendants is of exactly the same order, namely

(cid:96)κ
4(cid:96) f ∆ij ,∆kl

subcoll (∆0+γ(cid:96)+(cid:96),(cid:96))(v) ∼

1

v(3+2κ−∆ij +∆kl)/4

(cid:88)(cid:96)

(94)

We expect this to be true for higher level descendants as well.

B A tree-level case

Consider correlators G2323(u, v) and G2332(u, v) at tree-level. Let us focus in the leading
term, proportional to u3/2, in the small u expansion. One obtains

G2323(u, v) = u3/2(cid:16) a0
G2332(u, v) = u3/2(cid:18) b0

v

+ a1(cid:17) + ···
v(cid:19) + ···

b1

v2 +

22

(95)

(96)

In both cases, the divergences as v → 0 arise as we sum over the tower of intermediate
states HS3. Note that the OPE coeﬃcients entering in the expansions are related as c32(cid:96) =
(−1)(cid:96)c23(cid:96). Furthermore, for intermediate states of twist three, the sum over spins runs over
all natural numbers. At tree-level, we can assume an expansion of the form:

c23(cid:96)c23(cid:96) =

c23(cid:96)c32(cid:96) =

(cid:96)κ0
4(cid:96) (α0 + (−1)(cid:96) ˜α0) +
(cid:96)κ0
4(cid:96) ((−1)(cid:96)α0 + ˜α0) +

(cid:96)κ1
4(cid:96) (α1 + (−1)(cid:96) ˜α1) + ···
(cid:96)κ1
4(cid:96) ((−1)(cid:96)α1 + ˜α1) + ···

(97)

(98)

(cid:88)I
(cid:88)I

where I runs over all operators for a given spin and κ0 > κ1 will be ﬁxed momentarily. In
order to compute the divergent behaviour we use the results of appendix A. For the ﬁrst
correlator:

(cid:96)κ

4(cid:96) f (−1,−1)

coll (∆0+(cid:96),(cid:96))(v) =

α0

v(3+2κ0)/4 +

α1

v(3+2κ1)/4 + ···

a(cid:96)

(cid:88)(cid:96)

While for the second correlator

(−1)(cid:96)a(cid:96)

(cid:96)κ
4(cid:96) f

−1,−1
coll (∆0+(cid:96),(cid:96))(v) =

˜α0

v(3+2κ0+2)/4 +

˜α1

v(3+2κ1+2)/4 + ···

(cid:88)(cid:96)

(99)

(100)

The leading divergence of the second correlator implies κ0 = 3

2 together with ˜α0 ∼ b0.
Next, absence of a divergence 1/v3/2 in the ﬁrst correlator implies α0 = 0. Then, the leading
divergence of the ﬁrst correlator implies κ1 = 1
2, together with α1 ∼ a0, while the second
correlator implies ˜α1 = 0. The conclusion of this discussion is that, at tree-level

c23(cid:96)c23(cid:96) =

(cid:96)3/2
4(cid:96) (−1)(cid:96) ˜α0 +

(cid:96)1/2
4(cid:96) α1 + ···

c23(cid:96)c32(cid:96) =

(cid:96)3/2
4(cid:96) ˜α0 +

(cid:96)1/2
4(cid:96) (−1)(cid:96)α1 + ···

(101)

(102)

(cid:88)I
(cid:88)I

In the body of the paper we will be interested in a more general case, in which we consider
correlators of the form Gpqpq and Gqppq and the contribution from HSp+q−2m. The discussion
proceeds exactly as above. At tree-level it is possible to compute

Gpqpq|HSp+q−2m

= u

Gqppq|HSp+q−2m

= u

p+q−2m

(cid:16) c

23

(103)

(104)

So that at tree-level

cpq(cid:96)cpq(cid:96) =

(cid:96)p+q−2m−3/2

4(cid:96)

(−1)(cid:96) ˜α0 +

(cid:96)2min(p,q)−2m−3/2

cpq(cid:96)cqp(cid:96) =

(cid:96)p+q−2m−3/2

4(cid:96)

4(cid:96)
(cid:96)2min(p,q)−2m−3/2

4(cid:96)

(−1)(cid:96)α1 + ···

(cid:88)I
(cid:88)I

where the intermediate operator has twist p + q − 2m. For the case p = 3, q = 2, τ = 2 this
reduces to the previous case.

C Degeneracy of twist operators

In this appendix we study the degeneracy of primary operators with ﬁxed twist, of the form

T rϕi∂(cid:96)ϕL−i

(107)

where the derivative is along a ﬁxed null direction. For such operators the twist coincides
with the length L. The degeneracy of such operators can be easily computed by Polya theory.
First, let us consider the single letter partition function:

(105)

(106)

(108)

(109)

which counts states of the form ∂nϕ. The multi-letter partition function, taking into account
cyclycity of the trace is given by

Z1(q) = q + q2 + q3 + ··· =

q
1 − q

ZL(q) =

1
L

L(cid:88)s=1(cid:16)Z1(q

L

(s,L) )(cid:17)(s,L)

where (s, L) denotes the largest common divisor of s and L. In order to compute the number
of independent primaries, at each level we subtract the number of operators at previous level,
so that

is the generating function for the number of primaries. For the ﬁrst few twists we ﬁnd

PL(q) = (1 − q)ZL(q)

P2(q) =

P3(q) =

q2
1 − q2
q3((q − 1)q + 1)
(q − 1)2 (q2 + q + 1)

24

(110)

(111)

(112)

In particular primary operators with twist two are non-degenerate and have only even spin,
while primary operators of twist three and higher are always degenerate. The degeneracy
for large values of the spin can be understood from the behaviour near q = 1. We ﬁnd

dL((cid:96)) ∼ (cid:96)L−2.
