Single photon sources based on spontaneous photon-pair generation have

enabled pioneering experiments in quantum optics [1]. However, their non-

determinism presents a bottleneck to scaling up photonic and hybrid quantum-

enhanced technologies [2]. Furthermore, photon pairs are typically emitted

into many correlated frequency modes, producing an undesirable mixed state

on heralding [3]. Here we present a complete ﬁbre-integrated heralded single

photon source that addresses both these diﬃculties simultaneously. We use

active switching to provide a path to deterministic operation by multiplex-

ing separate spontaneous sources, and dispersion engineering to minimise fre-

quency correlation for high-purity single photon generation. All the essential

elements – nonlinear material with dispersion control, wavelength isolation,

optical delay, and fast switching – are incorporated in a low-loss alignment-

free package that heralds photons in telecoms single-mode ﬁbre. Our results

demonstrate a scalable approach to delivering pure single photons directly into

guided-wave photonic devices.

Single photons are a vital resource for quantum-enhanced technologies, not only those

that exploit nonclassical light to make high-precision measurements or process quantum

information but also hybrid platforms that require photonic links between matter qubits.

Spontaneous photon-pair sources based on either parametric downconversion (PDC) or

four-wave mixing (FWM) combined with heralding detection have established themselves

as the workhorses of nonclassical light generation due to their high performance and the

relative simplicity of the apparatus required [4, 5]: a laser, typically pulsed, generates

signal and idler photon pairs as it propagates through a nonlinear medium. Whether

or not their ultimate performance exceeds that of single-emitter photon sources [6, 7, 8],

photon-pair sources are essential to provide capability for the medium-term development of

quantum technologies, and perhaps further into the future. However, we have reached the

limits of the intrinsic capabilities of these sources; it is therefore of paramount importance

that we make every eﬀort to enhance their performance.

Two limitations arise from both pair generation mechanisms. Firstly, the number of

photon pairs produced per mode follows a thermal distribution. The resulting probability

p1 of generating one and only one photon pair from a single pump laser pulse can never
be higher than p1 = 0.25 [9]. Typically, the probability is kept much lower (p1 ≈ 0.01)
to limit detrimental contributions from n > 1 multi-pair events which increase of order

pn
1 . The resulting low single photon delivery probability, ηhηsp1 where ηh is the lumped

heralding detector channel eﬃciency and ηs is the signal channel transmission, is a serious

diﬃculty for larger-scale devices that require the simultaneous delivery of several heralded

single photons from independent sources [10]. The overall probability of delivering N in-

dependent single photons, (ηhηsp1)N , falls rapidly as the number of sources N increases.

In order to alleviate this problem, it is necessary to break the link between the proba-

bility of delivering a heralded single photon and that of generating multiple pairs. One

solution is a high-eﬃciency quantum memory with controllable read-out to synchronise

photons produced independently during diﬀerent clock cycles [11]. Alternatively a mul-

tiplexed source can be built to route the heralded output of several modes into a single

mode conditioned on a heralding detection [12]. Both methods enable the probability of

delivering a single photon to be increased without a commensurate increase in the multi-

photon probability [13, 14, 15], though multiplexing is less technologically challenging as it

requires only low-loss optical delay and active switching combined with fast detection and

feed-forward [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. It has been shown that multiplexing independent sources

can yield signiﬁcant performance enhancements, and even approach quasi-deterministic

operation [9].

The second limitation originates from energy conservation between the pump and

daughter ﬁelds. The redistribution of energy from pump to daughter photons typically

produces anti-correlation between the signal and idler frequencies. A heralding detection

of one photon then provides information about its twin, and the frequency mode into

which the heralded photon is projected varies randomly from shot to shot. The resulting

mixed state can be cleaned up with narrow-band spectral ﬁltering, but at the cost of

signiﬁcant loss and with a purity that approaches unity only as the ﬁlter bandwidth tends

to zero [21]. More elegantly, by tailoring the dispersion of the nonlinear medium and using

ultrashort pump pulses, frequency correlation can be minimised at the point of generation

yielding a high-purity state directly upon heralding [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. By expressing the

joint spectral amplitude of the photon pair, f (ωs, ωi), in the Schmidt basis of frequency

modes ξs(ωs) and ζi(ωi):

(cid:90) (cid:90)

|Ψ(cid:105) =

dωidωsf (ωs, ωi)|ωs(cid:105)|ωi(cid:105) → f (ωs, ωi) =

(cid:112)λjξs(ωs)ζi(ωi),

(cid:88)

n

(1)

the level of frequency correlation, and hence the reduced-state purity P , can be found

from the cooperativity parameter K = 1/(cid:80)

j λ2

j = 1/P . A completely separable state will

have only one pair of Schmidt modes active such that K = P = 1, but as the number of
Schmidt modes increases K → ∞ and P → 0.

Our heralded single-photon source addresses both of these limitations simultaneously

in a fully-integrated ﬁbre architecture.

In order to multiplex single photons eﬃciently,

we require high-purity photons to be heralded in modes that can be delayed in low-loss

telecoms ﬁbre. We have developed sources that achieve this through the application of

bespoke microstructured ﬁbre technology: using dispersion-engineered photonic crystal

ﬁbre (PCF) and novel broadband photonic bandgap ﬁbre (PBGF) ﬁlters for wavelength

isolation we have generated heralded photons in a fully guided-wave system with a high

3

level of intrinsic purity. With a low-loss ﬁbre-pigtailed switch we multiplexed the output of

two sources to enhance the single-photon delivery probability over that of a single source

without any increase in multi-photon noise.

The individual source design and performance is shown in Figure 2. We generated

photon pairs by FWM in two lengths of photonic crystal ﬁbre (PCF) dispersion-engineered

to minimise frequency correlation between the photons by group-velocity matching, as

detailed in the Supplementary Information [27, 28]. The PCF was pumped with a 1064 nm,

10 MHz modelocked ﬁbre laser (Fianium FemtoPower 1060-PP) to produce photon pairs

at highly nondegenerate wavelengths: 810 nm to enable eﬃcient heralding with room-

temperature silicon detectors, and 1550 nm to access the low-loss telecoms window in

commercial ﬁbre. Fibre Bragg gratings (3 dB bandwidth of 28 nm around 1064 nm) and a

ﬁbre wavelength division multiplexer were used to remove the pump pulses and separate

the daughter photons. These provided at least 90 dB of pump rejection in the signal and

idler channels.

However, to isolate the signal and idler from noise outside the FBG rejection band

(for example from Raman scattering and unwanted FWM processes) whilst also preserv-

ing the spectrum of the photon pairs we developed broadband ﬁlters based on photonic

bandgap ﬁbre (PBGF). We fabricated PBGFs with transmission bands centred at 800 nm

(PBGF-800) and 1550 nm (PBGF-1550) to provide low in-band loss around the transmis-

sion wavelengths combined with high loss for out-of-band noise photons. Custom ﬁbre

tapers were incorporated to mode-match the PBGF-1550 with telecoms single-mode ﬁbre

(SMF) and minimise loss. Hence the outputs at 800 nm and 1550 nm were delivered to

in conventional SMF (SM-800 and SMF-28 respectively) with total attenuation through
all components following the PCF of −5.6 dB at 800 nm and −7.0 dB at 1550 nm (see
Supplementary Information).

To conﬁrm both the similarity of the two sources and the level of frequency correlation
within each, the joint spectral intensity of the photon pairs, |f (ωs, ωi)|2, was measured
using stimulated emission tomography [29, 30] (SET; see Methods). The results for one
source are shown in Fig. 2c. The Schmidt decomposition of |f (ωs, ωi)| placed an upper
bound on the purity of the heralded single photons of P < 0.86, and the spectral overlap

of the two sources was 95%.

A direct measurement of the heralded single photon purity was obtained from the

marginal second-order coherence, g(2)

m (0) = 1 + 1/K = 1 + P . Two-mode squeezed states

m (0) = 2 leading

to a heralded single-photon purity of P = 1 [26]; as the number of modes (and associated
m (0) → 1. The
frequency correlation) increases the statistics become Poissonian and g(2)
results illustrated in Fig. 2d demonstrate that by matching the pump bandwidth with

the phasematching function to minimise spectral correlation yielded a maximum value
m (0) = 1.7 ± 0.03 corresponding to P = 0.7 ± 0.03. We believe this to be limited
of g(2)

primarily by the characteristics of our pump pulses.

To multiplex the sources, the heralded output of each source was delayed by 200 ns
using 42 m of SMF28 as shown in Figure 3a. The delay lines were spliced to a 2 × 1 ﬁbre-
coupled optical switch (bandwidth 1 MHz, insertion loss approximately 1 dB) to route

the heralded photons to a single output via an in-line ﬁbre polariser. One pump beam

contained an optical delay to match arrival times between idler photons from each source.

The switch state was set by a ﬁeld programmable gate array (FPGA) conditioned on the

heralding detection events, and the switch output was monitored by an InGaAs single

photon detector.

The single and coincidence count rates were measured after the output of the switch

for each source individually and with multiplexing activated. From the raw count rates we

evaluated the coincidence-to-accidentals ratio (CAR; see methods) to quantify source per-

formance with and without multiplexing, as shown in Fig. 3b. We measured the heralded
second-order coherence, g(2)

H (0), by adding a 50:50 ﬁbre coupler to the output of the switch
for both individual sources and the multiplexed system. The results are shown in Fig. 3c
and demonstrate g(2)
source. The value of g(2)

H (0) far below the classical limit of 1, as required for a single-photon
H (0) is non-zero due to multi-pair contributions and residual noise

photons that pass the ﬁlters.

The beneﬁt of multiplexing can be seen clearly from the results in Fig. 3c. At a

CAR of 40, activating the switch improved the heralded single-photon rate by a factor

of 1.93 relative to each individual source, close to the ideal value of 2. At this point the
multiplexed coincidence count rate was 125 s−1 with a heralded g(2)(0) < 0.1, whereas
the individual sources returned g(2)(0) ≈ 0.2 to achieve the same count rates. Hence our
results demonstrate that the multiplexed source achieves an increase in the probability of

delivering a single photon without a corresponding increase in the probability of multi-

photon noise. Furthermore, multiplexing remains advantageous when taking into account

the eﬀect of switch insertion loss on the individual sources.

dispersion control of the pump pulses to improve the heralded single photon purity, as

well as more ﬂexible shaping of the pump spectrum. Additionally we are developing

new PCF designs that we anticipate will reduce noise from unwanted nonlinear processes

hence enabling higher intrinsic pair generation rates without additional noise. A signiﬁcant

advantage of PCF-based FWM sources is that low average pump power is required per

ﬁbre, hence additional sources could straightforwardly be multiplexed from the same pump

laser. Finally, a switchable delay network would allow several modes to be multiplexed in

the time domain to combine the output from consecutive pump pulses.

With advanced microstructured ﬁbre technology we have generated spectrally uncorre-

lated single photons in a fully ﬁbre-integrated architecture. Heralding high-purity photons

in telecommunication ﬁbre modes gave us direct access to low-loss delay, enabling feed-

forward to a fast optical switch. As a result, we have successfully multiplexed two ﬁbre

sources of high-purity photons and demonstrated an improvement in performance over

similar individual sources. Our unique architecture requiring neither alignment nor nar-

row spectral ﬁltering is amenable to multiplexing larger numbers of high-purity sources,

providing a route to high-performance single-photon sources capable of delivering large

numbers of independent photons simultaneously.

Methods

Source Fabrication. The PCF and PBGF were fabricated at the University of Bath us-

ing the stack-and-draw technique. The PCF dispersion was ﬁne tuned by controlling the

hole-to-hole pitch via the ﬁbre diameter and the hole size varied by pressurising the holes

in the ﬁbre preform. To create ﬁbre tapers for mode matching, a series of large-mode

conventional ﬁbres were fabricated and then post-processed on a ﬂame-brush taper-rig.

12

These were designed to transform adiabatically the mode of SMF28 (mode-ﬁeld diameter
(MFD) ∼ 9 µm) to that of the PBGF-1550 (MFD ∼ 18 µm)[31, 32]. The sources were
assembled by fusion splicing the components in a conventional arc splicer.

Stimulated Emission Tomography. The JSI distribution of the photon-pairs gen-

erated in each PCF source was measured using stimulated four-wave mixing [29, 33]. The

PCF was pumped at 1064 nm and the FWM stimulated by a CW seed laser (bandwidth

<125 kHz, tuning range 1520 – 1630 nm) that was tuned across the range of idler wave-

lengths. The resulting stimulated FWM signal was recorded with an optical spectrum

analyser to ﬁnd the distribution of signal and idler emission wavelengths proportional to
|f (ωs, ωi)|2.

Coincidence-to-Accidentals Ratio. The coincidence-to-accidental ratio for a single

source, CAR(1), was calculated by taking the ratio of the measured coincidence count
rate, N (1)

the switch and in-line polariser, and an additional InGaAs detector monitored the second

output of the ﬁbre coupler. The two detectors were gated by the pump laser train and

synchronised. The coincidence count rate was measured with an integration time of be-

tween 15 and 45 mins. From the raw coincidence count rates we evaluated the marginal

PCF Dispersion Engineering

Elimination of spectral correlation between signal and idler photons results in a joint
spectral amplitude (JSA), f (ωs, ωi), that can be factorised: f (ωs, ωi) = gs(ωs) · gi(ωi).
Each function gj(ωj) is solely dependent on either the signal or idler photon.

Two eﬀects contribute to correlation in the JSA. Energy conservation results in anti-

correlation through the pump envelope function α(ωs + ωi), and momentum conservation

is described by the phasematching function φ(ωs, ωi) which is dependent on the dispersion

of the medium. The JSA is given by the product of these two functions :f (ωs, ωi) = α(ωs +

ωi)φ(ωs, ωi). Hence by orientating the phasematching function such that the correlation

it imparts on the JSA completely counters the contribution of the pump envelope, we can

produce a two-photon state in which there are no spectral correlations. In practice this

can be achieved by setting the group velocity of the pump to be between that of the signal

and the idler [3, 27].

PCF gives the ability to tune group-velocity dispersion through control of the ﬁbre

cladding. We designed and fabricated a PCF with two zero dispersion wavelengths as

14

seen in Fig. S1a and S2. The resulting phasematching contours, the loci of points with

zero phase mismatch between the pump, signal and idler are shown in Fig. S1b. The two

ZDWs give phasematching contours that form a pair of closed loops, one for the signal

and one for the idler. Hence by tuning the pump wavelength, the correlation induced in

the two-photon JSA by the phasematching function may be controlled, and used to negate

the correlation imparted by the pump envelope function.

The closed loop phasematching contour means that factorability will always be sat-

isﬁed for a certain range of pump wavelengths, but the phasematched signal and idler

wavelengths may not be ideal. Nevertheless, through careful design the PCF structure

can be tuned to achieve minimal correlation for a set of target FWM wavelengths, in this

case 800 nm and 1550 nm. We have targeted a state where the signal becomes group-

velocity matched to the pump. In this case the signal photon is localised to the pump

temporal mode, whereas the idler photon walks oﬀ from the pump, yielding a narrower

bandwidth idler photon. This corresponds to the phasematching function lying parallel

to the signal axis in Fig. S1c, when the bandwidths of the phasematching function and

pump envelope function are matched, the JSI depicted in Fig. S1d is formed.

During the ﬁbre drawing process, the fabricated ﬁbre was characterised with bright

FWM using a 1064nm nanosecond pulsed microchip laser to conﬁrm the wavelength of

phasematched FWM. An example FWM spectrum is shown in Fig. S3. The ﬁbre draw

parameters were then adjusted to tune the FWM peaks to the target wavelengths.

In

Fig. S3 the outer-sideband phasematched solutions at 800 nm and 1550 nm can be clearly

seen. Closer to the pump, cascaded FWM can be seen as a result of inner-sideband

phasematching; these inner-sideband processes are one source of noise that our PBGF

ﬁlters had to be capable of removing.

Photonic Bandgap Fibre Filtering

Figure S4 shows the photonic density of states for photonic bandgap ﬁbre (PBGF) cladding

consisting of a triangular lattice of high refractive index inclusions (Ge-doped rods) in a

background of fused silica, calculated using the ﬁxed-frequency plane wave method [34, 35].

The eﬀective refractive index is plotted as a function of free-space wavevector normalised

to the pitch of the cladding. Grey regions correspond to a high density of states where

the cladding supports sets of guided modes, while regions shown in red correspond to

the photonic bandgaps of the cladding in which guided modes are not supported in the

15

cladding. The blue line corresponds to the refractive index of the target wavelength,

1550 nm, in silica, and where it intersects the red regions, bandgaps are formed in the

cladding at the target wavelength. Any light with a wavevector lying within the bandgap

cannot propagate in the cladding, and therefore becomes trapped within the low index

core [36]. Figure S4 displays the resulting transmission spectra of PBGF-800 and PBGF-

1550, measured using a supercontinuum light source.

Due to the large pitch required to form bandgaps at the correct wavelength for PBGF-

1550, the guided mode was signiﬁcantly larger than that of SMF-28 resulting in poor splice

performance. To reduce the loss and improve the mechanical stability of the splice between

PBGF-1550 and SMF-28, a series of tapered-ﬁbre transitions were fabricated using the

ﬂame-brush technique [32]. A graded-index large mode area (LMA) ﬁbre was fabricated

in which the guided mode and the outer diameter were both matched to that of PBGF-

1550 to ensure low loss and high mechanical strength when spliced. The LMA ﬁbre was

tapered to a diameter of 125um to match that of SMF-28 whilst also providing good mode

ﬁeld overlap. A schematic of the complete spliced PBGF-1550 ﬁlter is shown in Fig. S5a.

The fundamental mode entering from the SMF-28 was adiabatically transformed in the

up-taper region and then launched into the PBGF-1550, and a second down-taper on the

output side transformed the mode back to match that of SMF-28 [31]. The transmission

through the complete ﬁlter (3 dB at 1550 nm) was measured by performing a cut-back

Source transmission measurement

A cut-back measurement was made using a supercontinuum light source to ﬁnd the trans-

mission of one complete photon-pair source, from the PCF to the output of the ﬁnal single

mode ﬁbres. The spectrally-resolved transmission is shown in Fig. S6 for the signal and

idler channels. The low-loss regions in each arm are largely deﬁned by the bandgaps of

the PBGF ﬁlters. The total loss was found to be 5.6dB and 5.0dB for the signal and idler

respectively. In the idler arm following the single mode ﬁbre, an extra 1dB was incurred

due to the transmission loss of the optical switch used for multiplexing, and a further 1dB

of loss in the in-line polariser.

Stimulated emission tomography of the joint spectral density

The FWM joint spectral density was measured by stimulating the process with a seed laser

at one of the daughter wavelengths, following the method proposed by Sipe and Liscidini

channels respectively.

known as stimulated emission tomography [29]. As the spontaneous and stimulated forms

of the nonlinear optical interaction are governed by the same phasematching and energy

conservation, the stimulated signal is proportional to the probability amplitude of the two

photon state.

A schematic of the set-up used to measure the joint spectral intensity distribution

is shown in Fig. S7b. Each setting of the seed wavelength gave one stimulated signal

spectrum as seen Fig. S7a. By stacking these spectra the joint spectrum was recovered.

The measurement can be made in a short time and at high resolution using an optical

spectrum analyser rather than photon-counting detectors.

Figure S7 illustrates the results for a single length of PCF at three diﬀerent pump

wavelengths. The bandwidths of the signal and idler photons are not equal as in this

instance the bandwidth of the phasematching function (set by the ﬁbre length) is not

well-matched to that of the pump function. Together these three plots may be used to

infer the orientation of the phasematching function. As the pump wavelength is tuned, the

phasematched signal wavelength increases without a commensurate increase in the idler

wavelength. This indicates that the phasematching function lies parallel to the signal axis.

This is in agreement with our earlier simulation of the phasematching contours where the

resulting signal photon was group-velocity matched to the pump.

We have used this technique to match the bandwidth of the pump pulses to the ﬁbre
