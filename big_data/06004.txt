By making use of a low-energy eﬀective model of Weyl semimetals, we show that the Fermi arc
transport is dissipative. The origin of the dissipation is the scattering of the surface Fermi arc states
into the bulk of the semimetal. It is noticeable that corresponding scattering rate is nonzero and can
be estimated even in a perturbative theory, although in general the reliable calculations of transport
properties necessitate a nonperturbative approach. Nondecoupling of the surface and bulk sectors
in the low-energy theory of Weyl semimetals invalidates the usual argument of a nondissipative
transport due to one-dimensional arc states. This property of Weyl semimetals is in drastic contrast
to that of topological insulators, where the decoupling is protected by a gap in the bulk. Within the
framework of the linear response theory, we obtain an approximate result for the conductivity due
to the Fermi arc states and analyze its dependence on chemical potential, temperature, and other
parameters of the model.

INTRODUCTION

Dirac and Weyl semimetals, whose low-energy quasiparticle excitations are described by the Dirac and Weyl equa-
tions, respectively, became an active and vibrant area of research in condensed matter physics. Theoretically, Dirac
semimetals were predicted to be realized in A3Bi (A = Na, K, Rb) and Cd3As2 compounds [1, 2]. By using angle-
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), the Dirac nature of quasiparticles in the corresponding materials was
indeed conﬁrmed in Refs. [3–5], opening the path toward experimental investigations of the three-dimensional Dirac
semimetals.

In momentum space, a Dirac point can be viewed as a superposition of two Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. If these
nodes are separated in momentum or energy, then a Weyl semimetal is realized. Theoretically, the existence of Weyl
semimetals was ﬁrst predicted in pyrochlore iridates in Ref. [6]. Most recently, Weyl semimetals were experimentally
discovered in Refs. [7–12], where the observations of characteristic surface Fermi arc states and unusual transport
properties were reported for such compounds as TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP, MoxW1−xTe, and YbMnBi2.
One of the key features of both Dirac and Weyl semimetals is their unusual magnetotransport, which is profoundly
aﬀected by the chiral anomaly. The corresponding anomaly was originally discovered in high-energy physics in the
analysis of the linearly divergent triangle diagrams [13].
It appears to have a qualitative eﬀect also on magneto-
transport of chiral plasmas [14]. As was ﬁrst shown by Nielsen and Ninomiya [15], the longitudinal (with respect
to the direction of the external magnetic ﬁeld) magnetoresistivity in Weyl semimetals decreases with the growth of
the magnetic ﬁeld (called a negative megnetoresistivity phenomenon in the literature). This phenomenon was ﬁrst
observed experimentally in Bi1−xSbx alloy with x ≈ 0.03 [16].
The physical reason for the negative magnetoresistivity is quite transparent [15, 17]. Since the lowest Landau
level (LLL) states around each Weyl node are described by an eﬀective one-dimensional chiral theory, they cannot
backscatter on impurities. Therefore, the conductivity of such states is ﬁnite only due to backscattering between
Weyl nodes with opposite chirality. Then, since the LLL density of states grows linearly with a magnetic ﬁeld, the
conductivity increases too. When the LLL contribution dominates, the total magnetoresistivity decreases with the
ﬁeld. We note, however, that theoretical analysis based on the Kubo’s formula suggests that Dirac semimetals may
also have a negative magnetoresistivity in the same regime [18]. Moreover, as argued in Ref. [19], the ionic impurity
scattering can cause negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity in a generic three-dimensional metal in the quantum
limit.

In fact, the absence of backscattering for one-dimensional chiral fermions provides the physical reason for the
nondissipative electric transport in the quantum Hall eﬀect (QHE) [20] resulting in a vanishing conductivity. It was
shown in Ref. [21] that the fantastic exactness of the QHE conductivity is connected with nontrivial topological prop-
erties of QHE materials, which are encoded in the nonzero Chern numbers. Since the vacuum has trivial topological
characteristics, current-carrying edge states are topologically protected that leads to the celebrated bulk-boundary
correspondence.

2

The Haldane model [22] showed that the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld is not a necessary ingredient for the
realization of the QHE. In fact, the ﬁrst experimentally discovered two-dimensional topological insulator HgTe [23] can
be considered as a combination of two copies of the Haldane model. Its nontrivial topological properties are described
by the Z2 index [24] and its conducting edge states are composed of two counterpropagating one-dimensional chiral
fermions, related to each other through the time reversal transformation. In the absence of magnetic impurities, the
edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator are immune to backscattering and, thus, lead to a nondissipative
transport.

A Weyl node also possesses nontrivial topological properties. It represents a monopole of the Berry curvature in
momentum space, whose charge is connected with the chirality of the node. This is reﬂected in the characteristic
properties of Weyl semimetals. One of them is the existence of the surface Fermi arc states, which are open segments
of the Fermi surface connecting projections of the bulk cones onto the surface [6, 25, 26]. Such states connect the Fermi
surfaces for the opposite chirality quasiparticles that otherwise would appear to be disconnected [26]. Experimentally,
the Fermi arcs are directly observed with the help of the ARPES technique [8, 9].

Recently, the surface Fermi arcs were studied via another powerful technique, scanning tunneling spectroscopy
(STS) [27, 28]. Theoretical calculations [29–31] and experimental studies [32–34] of quasiparticle interference (QPI)
patterns caused by surface impurities or defects provide an alternative way to investigate surface Fermi arcs. Note
that these QPI patterns are momentum space counterparts of Friedel oscillations [35]. Furthermore, the QPI reveals
possible surface scattering processes, which cannot be directly measured by ARPES. However, the interpretation of
QPI patterns strongly relays on theoretical calculations, providing a powerful, although indirect, evidence of Fermi
arcs.

It is interesting that Dirac semimetals A3Bi (A = Na, K, Rb) also have Fermi arcs. It was shown in Ref. [36] that
there exists a hidden “up-down” (ud) parity symmetry in the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian that allows one to split
the electron states into two separate sectors, with each describing a Weyl semimetal. Therefore, the corresponding
Dirac semimetals are, in fact, Z2 Weyl semimetals.

As suggested in Ref. [37], the surface Fermi arc states can be detected indirectly by measuring the density of states in
surface-sensitive probes. Indeed, when a magnetic ﬁeld is applied to a Weyl semimetal, a special type of closed magnetic
orbits, involving both the surface Fermi arcs and the bulk states, are predicted to exist [37]. The corresponding orbits
produce periodic quantum oscillations of the density of states with a characteristic dependence on the separation
between the Weyl nodes in momentum space (transport experiments which probe the electronic properties of these
orbits were suggested in Ref. [38]). The corresponding quantum oscillations were recently experimentally observed
[39] in the Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. As was shown in Ref. [40], these quantum oscillations also encode the eﬀects of
interaction, which are predicted to modify the length of the Fermi arcs. In particular, one expects to see a nontrivial
dependence of the quantum oscillations on the orientation of the magnetic ﬁeld projection in the plane of the semimetal
surface [40]. By numerically studying a minimal model of a Weyl semimetal, it was recently shown in Ref. [41] that
the area enclosed by the Fermi surface and quantum oscillations in the thin ﬁlm limit strongly depend on the in-plane
magnetic ﬁeld component parallel to the Weyl nodes splitting even in the non-interacting free theory.

Since the Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals are topologically protected, it is natural that they are described by an
eﬀective Hamiltonian of one-dimensional chiral fermions. This suggests that the electron transport via Fermi arcs
should be nondissipative. The latter would be a rather rigorous conclusion if the eﬀective one-dimensional Hamiltonian
of arc states stayed generally intact in the presence of impurities and disorder. However, as will be argued in this
work, the situation is more complicated, and this is not necessarily the case. Indeed, as was shown in Ref. [42], in
materials without a gap, “surface” quasiparticles are dephased by coupling to the bulk. It was argued in Ref. [31]
that in such a case there is no simple eﬀective theory for surface states because the surface Green’s functions for a
Weyl semimetal necessarily contain the information about the electronic propagation from the surface into the bulk
and back to the surface.

The paper is organized as follows. The eﬀective Hamiltonian of the surface Fermi arc states in the simplest model of
Weyl semimetal and a model of disorder used in the present paper are described in Sec. II. The Fermi arc conductivity
in the eﬀective one-dimensional surface model is considered both in naive and nonperturbative approaches in Sec. III.
Perturbative signs of dissipation in the full model are revealed and analyzed in Sec. IV. The quasiparticle width and
Fermi arc conductivity in the full model are calculated in Sec. V. The obtained results are discussed and summarized
in Sec. VI.

For convenience, throughout the paper, we set  = 1.

II. MODEL OF A WEYL SEMIMETAL AND FERMI ARC STATES

In order to present our arguments as simple as possible, in this paper we study one of the simplest continuum
models of a Weyl semimetal proposed by Okugawa and Murakami [43]. The Hamiltonian of the model describes a

pair of Weyl nodes separated in momentum space

3

(1)

H(k) = γ(cid:0)k2

z − m(cid:1) σz + vF (kxσx + kyσy) ,

where vF , m and γ are positive constants. As is easy to check, the two Weyl nodes are located at kz = ±√m. We
assume that, in coordinate space, the semimetal is in the upper half-plane y > 0 and the vacuum is in the lower
half-plane y < 0. In order to prevent quasiparticles from escaping into the vacuum region, we set m → − ˜m and take
the limit ˜m → ∞ for y < 0. Because of the semimetal surface at y = 0, the translation invariance in the y direction
is broken. Therefore, we keep the operator form for ky = −i∂y in Hamiltonian (1).
By considering the eigenvalue problem Hψ = Eψ, it is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd the wave-functions of the surface states
in semimetal and vacuum,

1(cid:19) ,
ψy>0 = pp(kz) eikxx+ikzz−p(kz )y(cid:18) 1

ψy<0 = pp(kz) eikxx+ikzz+γ ˜my(cid:18) 1
z )/vF and −√m < kz < √m. The corresponding expression for the surface state

(2)

(3)

respectively, where p(kz) = γ(m − k2
energy reads

Es = vF kx.

(4)

The eﬀective Hamiltonian for the surface Fermi arc states is given by (see Ref. [44] for a derivation of the eﬀective
Hamiltonian for the surface states in topological insulators)

Hsurf = −ivF ∂x

(5)

and, as expected, describes one-dimensional chiral fermions.

The energy spectrum of model (1) is shown in Fig. 1. In order to obtain the corresponding numerical results, we

chose the model parameters as in Ref. [1], i.e.,

m = 0.0082 ˚A−2

,

2
γ = 10.6424 eV ˚A

,

vF = 2.4598 eV ˚A,

a = 5.448 ˚A,

c = 9.655 ˚A.

(6)

This choice mimics the eﬀective low-energy description of Na3Bi. As we see from Fig. 1, the Fermi surface consists of
the bulk sheets connected by a Fermi arc.

FIG. 1: (Color online) The bulk (blue) and Fermi arc (red) states in the model of Weyl semimetal at y > 0 given by Eq. (1)
(left panel). Its Fermi surface is plotted for the Fermi energy EF /(γm) = 0.9 (right panel).

In our study of Fermi arcs transport, we will use the simplest model of quenched disorder, in which the interaction

of electrons with impurities is described by the following Hamiltonian:

Hdis =Z dr ψ†(r)U (r)ψ(r)

(7)

with the local disorder potential

U (r) =Xj

u(r − rj) =Xj

u0δ(r − rj)

4

(8)

whose strength is determined by u0. This simple form of disorder greatly simpliﬁes many calculations. In some cases,
however, the singular nature of the δ-function may cause unphysical divergencies. When that happens, one may
replace the potential in Eq. (8) with a Gaussian function, i.e.,

(r−rj )2

2g2

e−
(2πg2)3/2 .

U (r) =Xj

u0

(9)

The translation invariance, which is broken by the disorder, can be eﬀectively restored by averaging over the positions
of impurities, i.e.,

hA(r)idis =

1

V Xj Z d3rj A(rj),

(10)

where V is the volume of the system. The impurity correlation function for the local disorder with the potential in
Eq. (8) is

hu(r − rj)u(r′ − rj)idis = u2

0nimpδ(r − r′),

(11)

where nimp = Nimp/V is the concentration of impurities.

III. FERMI ARCS CONDUCTIVITY IN THE EFFECTIVE ONE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL

In this section, we investigate the transport properties of the surface Fermi arc states by using the eﬀective one-
dimensional model (5). The tacit assumption of such an approach is that the dynamics of the surface states decouples
from the dynamics of the bulk states. (As we argue later, this is not the case in Weyl semimetals.)

We will utilize the Kubo’s linear response formalism. Formally, the conductivity tensor is expressed through the

retarded current-current correlation function, i.e.,

σnm(ω; r, r′) = −

i
ω

Πnm(ω; r, r′),

where the correlator itself is deﬁned via the following ground state expectation value:

To one-loop order, the correlation function is given by the following expression:

Πnm(t − t′; r, r′) = iθ(t − t′)h[jn(t, r), jm(t′, r′)]i.

Πxx(iΩn; r, r′) = e2v2

F T Xiωl

hG(iωl; r, r′)G(iωl − iΩn; r′, r)idis,

(12)

(13)

(14)

where ωl = (2l + 1)πT and Ωn = 2nπT are the fermion and boson Matsubara frequencies, respectively. As usual, the
retarded forms of the correlation functions and propagators are obtained by replacing iωl → ω + i0 and iΩn → Ω + i0.
After averaging the expression in Eq. (14) over the positions of impurities, we obtain a translation invariant result
Π(iΩn; r − r′).

A. Approximation without cross-correlation diagrams

In order to derive an approximate result for the conductivity, one might try replacing the average hG(iωl; r, r′)G(iωl−
iΩn; r′, r)idis with the product hG(iωl; r, r′)idishG(iωl − iΩn; r′, r)idis in the deﬁnition of the current-current correlator
(14). In three-dimensional models, such an approximation is usually not too bad. However, as is well known and as
we show below, it fails in the one-dimensional model at hand. Still, such an approximation is instructive for the later
study of the full model as a useful reference point.

5

By taking into account that each disorder-averaged propagator is translation invariant, it is natural to use the

momentum-space representation for the correlation function:

Πxx(iΩn, q) ≃ e2v2

F T Xiωl Z

dk
(2π)2 hG(iωl, k)idishG(iωl − iΩn, k − q)idis,

(15)

where hG(iωl; k)idis is the Fourier transform of the coordinate-space propagator averaged over the positions of impu-
rities. Furthermore, it is convenient to express the propagator in terms of its spectral function A(ω, k),

hG(iωl, k)idis =Z ∞

(16)

where, by deﬁnition,

A(ω, k) =

In terms of the spectral function, the conductivity can be expressed as follows:

(18)

Note that, in the last expression, we calculated the sum over the Matsubara frequencies and performed the appropriate
analytical continuation to real values of frequencies, iΩn → Ω + i0.
The expression for the DC conductivity of the Fermi arcs can now be obtained from Eq. (18) by calculating the
appropriate limit: q → 0 and Ω → 0. The correct order of limits is to take the long-range limit (q → 0) ﬁrst and the
static limit (Ω → 0) second. Then, one derives the following general result for the real part of the DC conductivity:

B. Simple model for the quasiparticle decay width

In the eﬀective model (5), the explicit form of the free (causal) propagator for the Fermi arc states reads

Garc(ω, k) = i

z )

ω + µ − vF kx + i0 sign(ω)

.

(20)

Notice the overall factor θ(m − k2
of kz: −√m < kz < √m. The spectral function of the corresponding surface propagator is obtained by making use
of the deﬁnition in Eq. (17),

z ), which takes into account the fact that the arc states exist only for a ﬁnite range

As is clear, this model describes surface Fermi arc quasiparticles with a vanishing decay width. A nonzero decay width
Γ can be introduced semi-rigorously by replacing the δ-function in the last expression with a Lorentzian distribution,

A(ω, k) = iδ(ω − vF kx) θ(m − k2
z ).

(21)

AΓ(ω, k) =

i
π

Γ

(ω − vF kx)2 + Γ2 θ(m − k2

(22)

As we will argue later, it is indeed justiﬁed to introduce a nonzero decay width for the Fermi arc quasiparticles. Here
we will ignore the fact that the speciﬁc model details in Eq. (22) may not capture all realistic properties of surface
quasiparticles.

In order to make a rough estimate for the quasiparticle width of the Fermi arc states, we can use a perturbation
theory in the impurity potential. In the model of quenched disorder with a local potential, the impurity correlation
function (11) in momentum space is given by

D(ω, k) = nimpu2

0(2π)δ(ω).

C. Nondissipative transport from nonperturbative treatment in one-dimensional

It is easy to show that the naive calculation of the conductivity in the previous subsection is unreliable for one-
dimensional chiral fermions, described by the eﬀective low-energy model (5). The corresponding argument is well
known [45].

In the presence of quenched disorder in one-dimension, the eigenstate wave-functions for chiral fermions can be

calculated exactly (note the absence of backscattering)

leading to the following exact Green’s function for the corresponding Fermi arcs states:

ψE(x) = e

i

vF hEx−Pj u0 R x

dzδ(z−xj)i,

Then, to one-loop order, the electron self-energy of the surface Fermi arcs states equals

Σarc(Ω, q) ≡

By making use of Eq. (20), we ﬁnd

Formally, this result for the conductivity shows that the transport is Ohmic (dissipative) whenever the surface arc
quasiparticles have a nonzero width. The nondissipative regime is possible only when the quasiparticle width vanishes,
i.e., Γ → 0. Therefore, the issue of the quasiparticle width for the surface states appears to be an important aspect
that can shed light on the nature of the arc’s transport. We will try to resolve this issue later. Before doing that,
however, we should also address the validity of the approximation for the current-current correlator with cross-
correlation diagrams neglected. As is well known and as we show below, such an approximation is not reliable. It will
be essential, therefore, to account for some cross-correlations. This will be done via the inclusion of the appropriate
vertex corrections in Sec. V B.

the disorder potential appears only as a single phase

Pj u0 [θ(x − xj) − θ(x′ − xj)] in the exponent. Moreover, the phase is such that it changes the overall sign un-

der the interchange of x and x′. Therefore, after substituting propagator (29) into the expression for the retarded
current-current correlation function (14), we ﬁnd that all eﬀects of disorder drop out from the ﬁnal result. In other
words, in the eﬀective one-dimensional surface model deﬁned by Eq. (5), disorder does not aﬀect the Fermi arc
transport, i.e., the transport is nondissipative. One should note, however, that this conclusion does not necessarily
imply the vanishing quasiparticle width for the surface states. The corresponding width Γ is a characteristic of the
propagator (29) averaged over the disorder. Irrespective of the actual value of such a width, it does not aﬀect the
result for the correlation function (14). This is in contrast to the naive arguments of Sec. III B, which relied on the
approximation where the cross-correlation between the quasiparticle propagators was neglected. This simple obser-
vation is instructive and should be kept in mind in the analysis of transport properties of the Fermi arc states in a
more realistic model of a Weyl (semi-)metal in the next section.

IV. PERTURBATIVE SIGNS OF DISSIPATION IN THE FULL MODEL

As we showed in the previous section, the absence of dissipation in the Fermi arc transport in the one-dimensional
eﬀective model of chiral fermions is connected with its very unique property that all eﬀects of quenched disorder in
the exact Green’s function G(ω; x, x′) are captured in a single phase factor, which is odd under the interchange of x
and x′. Because of its special property, the phase factor drops out of the expression for the current-current correlator,
i.e., disorder has no eﬀect on the transport.

Below, we will argue that the full eﬀective model of Weyl semimetals (1), which necessarily contains both the
surface Fermi arc states and the bulk states, does not share this property. The formal reasons for this are (i) the loss
of one-dimensional kinematic constraint in scattering of chiral fermions and (ii) the nondecoupling of the low-energy
dynamics of the two types of states (i.e., surface and bulk). From a physical viewpoint, this immediately leads to a
dissipation because the surface Fermi arc states can easily scatter into the bulk. With the loss of exact integrability
in the full model, of course, we cannot present an exact solution supporting this claim. Instead, we will use physical
arguments that strongly support nondecoupling and dissipation.

Let us consider the scattering of the Fermi arc states using the Born approximation. A convenient starting point

for such an analysis is the Lippmann–Schwinger equation for the surface states,

ψs(r) = ψ(0)

s (r) − iZ d3r′S(r, r′)U (r′)ψs(r′),

(30)

where ψ(0)
s (r) ≡ ψy>0 is the incident surface wave as in Eq. (2). Strictly speaking, here we should use a regularized
Gaussian form of the disorder potential U (r′), given in Eq. (9). Indeed, if a point-like interaction is used, the second
term in the Lippmann–Schwinger equation would give a contribution to the wave-functionPj u0S(r, rj)ψs(rj ), which

In general, solving the Lippmann–Schwinger equation is a quite diﬃcult (nonperturbative) problem. Instead, here
we will consider a perturbative solution in the Born approximation, in which the surface state wave-function on the
right hand side of Eq. (30) is replaced with ψ(0)

diverges at the location of impurities.

s (r).

It may be instructive to recall that the Born approximation can be readily derived from the spectral problem,
(H0 + U )ψ = Eψ. Assuming a perturbative expansion of the solution in the form ψ ≃ ψ(0) + ψ(1), where ψ(0)
are the eigenstates of the free Hamiltonian H0, we easily derive the formal result for the ﬁrst order correction:
ψ(1) = (E − H0)−1U ψ(0). Noting that S ≡ i(E − H0)−1 is the operator form of the free propagator and taking into
account its coordinate-space representation, we see that ψ(1) coincides with the second term in Eq. (30) in the Born
approximation.

A. Free propagator in the full model

In the clean limit (i.e., no disorder), it is straightforward to derive an explicit expression for the retarded quasiparticle
Green’s function (free propagator) in the full eﬀective model (1) by making use of the general deﬁnition: SR(ω, r, r′) ≡
iPE ψE(r)ψ†E(r′)/(ω − E + i0), where the sum runs over a complete set of the energy eigenstates. By taking into
account that the Hilbert space of the corresponding eigenvalue problem contains both bulk and surface states, the
resulting Green’s function naturally splits into the surface and bulk contributions:

Interestingly, we ﬁnd that Fr,r′ falls oﬀ as a power-law function of y, rather than an exponential function, when y → ∞.
At ﬁrst sight, this seems surprising since (almost) all surface states, see Eq. (2), have an exponential dependence on
y. The puzzle is resolved by noting that the exponents vanish near the ends of the Fermi arcs, i.e., when kz → ±√m.

Thus, when integrating over all momenta in the surface Green’s function, the contributions from the regions with a
(nearly) vanishing exponent dominate the coordinate-space asymptotes. In fact, this is also an indication that the
dynamics of the surface arc states in the full model does not decouple from the dynamics of the bulk states.

B. Scattering of Fermi arc states in the Born approximation

By making use of the general result in the Born approximation and the explicit form of the free propagator (31),

to the ﬁrst order in the disorder potential, the scattered wave is given by

ψ(1)(r) = ψ(1)

s (r) + ψ(1)

(38)

(39)

(40)

Note that there are separate surface and bulk waves. This is in agreement with the structure of the quasiparticle
Green’s function in the full model, which contains both the surface and bulk contributions, see Eqs. (31) through (33).
As mentioned earlier, a regularized version of the impurity potential (9) should be used in the above expression for
the scattered bulk wave. Otherwise, the result will be singular at r → rj. For the purposes of extracting the outgoing
waves at large distances r → ∞, however, it suﬃces to use the local form of the potential given by Eq. (8).
Then, by making use of the propagator in Eq. (32) and the z → ∞ asymptote from Eq. (36), we derive the following
result for the surface part of the scattered wave:

ψ(1)

s (r) ≃ 4i√mγu0Xj

(41)

While the x-component of momentum kx remains unchanged in the scattered wave, the z-component of momentum

drastically changes from the original value kz, constrained only by its range: −√m < kz < √m. Indeed, the outgoing

wave is a superposition of two waves with limiting values of the momenta, kz = ±√m. Since the distinction between

the two types of states fades away in the corresponding region of the phase space, one might argue that the Fermi arc
states are pushed towards the bulk states.

In the case of a single impurity, the representative numerical results for the scattered surface portion of the wave-
function, ψ(1)
s , are shown in Fig. 2. As one can see from the x-dependence in the left panel, there is no backscattering
(i.e., into the region x < 0) of the surface wave.
In the region x > 0, the π/2 phase shift between the real and
imaginary parts of ψ(1)
suggests a characteristic behavior, eikxx, of a plane wave propagating forward. The other
two panels in Fig. 2 show the proﬁles of the real and imaginary parts of the scattered wave in the y direction (into
the bulk) and the z direction (along the surface). These latter two are of no particular signiﬁcance by themselves.
However, they will serve as a useful benchmark later in our comparison with the waves scattered into the bulk.

In the case of a single impurity, the numerical results for the scattered bulk portion of the wave-function, ψ(1)

where, by deﬁnition, Ω2 ≡ ω2 − γ2(k2
, are
shown in Figs. 3 and 4. From the x-dependence of the scattered wave, presented in the left panels of Figs. 3 and 4,
we see clearly that backscattering is present. This is in contrast to the surface scattered wave, studied earlier. There
are also qualitative diﬀerences in the z and y dependence of the scattered bulk wave, presented in the middle and
right panels of Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Unlike the corresponding surface counterparts, studied earlier, these results
reveal outgoing waves propagating into the bulk. This is suggested by the characteristic phase shift of π/2 between
the real and imaginary parts of all components of the wave-function.

(43)

It is interesting to study the asymptotes of the bulk scattered wave ψ(1)

b (r) at large values of the coordinates along
the surface of the semimetal, i.e., x ≫ a and z ≫ a. Both asymptotes reveal a long-range (propagating) tail with
a weak modulation of the amplitudes. This is demonstrated in Fig. 5, in which we show the real part of the upper
component of ψ(1)
as a function of x/a (left panel) and as a function of z/c for large values of the arguments. Note,
that the red shaded area in the plot is an outcome of many oscillations with a small period. From the numerical result
in Fig. 5, we ﬁnd that the amplitude of the large scale modulations decreases as 1/x at large x/a and as 1/z2 at large
z/c. As one can check, the same qualitative behavior is valid for the real part of the lower component of ψ(1)
, as well
as for the imaginary parts of both components.

To summarize our results, we ﬁnd that, after scattering on an impurity, a surface wave produces not only (forward-
scattered) surface states, but also waves propagating into the bulk. This implies that a naive low-energy consideration
of the surface Fermi arc states is invalid. Indeed, such approximately one-dimensional states are not decoupled from
the three-dimensional bulk states. In the context of transport properties, this means that a proper analysis of the
dynamics with a mixing of the two types of states is required. This problem is addressed in the next section.

11

V. FERMI ARC WIDTH AND CONDUCTIVITY IN THE FULL MODEL

In this section, we study the transport properties of the Fermi arcs in the full model (1) that contains not only the
surface states, but also the gapless bulk states. As expected, the exact integrability of the full model is lost and we
have to rely on some approximations. By making use of the simpliﬁed analysis in the previous section, we will work
out an approximate scheme that captures the essential details of the low-energy dynamics.

The nonperturbative arguments of Sec. III C may suggest that the transport due to the Fermi arcs is nondissipative.
However, it is quite reasonable to suspect that the description of the Fermi arc states using the eﬀective Hamiltonian
(5) is inadequate. The point is that the corresponding approach completely ignores the possibility of the surface states
scattering into the bulk. From a physics viewpoint, however, such scattering is unavoidable at least in certain regions
of the phase space. In particular, this is the case for the surface states near the ends of the Fermi arcs, where they
smoothly transform into the bulk states. As we argue below, the resulting non-decoupling of the surface and bulk
sectors in the full theory is critical. It is responsible for dissipative transport properties.

The general deﬁnition of the conductivity in terms of the current-current correlation function (12) remains valid
also in the full model (1). However, one has to modify the deﬁnition of the currents to account for the correct matrix
structure of the vertices, i.e.,

jx = −evF ψ†σxψ,
jz = −2eγkzψ†σzψ.

(44)
(45)

By taking into account the matrix structure of the vertices in these currents and the matrix structure of the surface
state propagator (32), it is straightforward to show that two out of three possible components of the conductivity
tensor are vanishing, i.e., σxz = σzz = 0. The remaining nontrivial component of the DC conductivity tensor reads

Note that the result may depend on the position vector r (e.g., see Ref. [51]). In the coordinate space, the corresponding
correlator is given by

where we kept only the linear term in Ω, which is relevant for the DC conductivity.
In the last expression, f (ω)
is the Fermi-Dirac quasiparticle distribution function. In the limit of zero temperature, in particular, it is given by
f0(ω) = θ(µ − ω).
(ω; r, r′) are calculated in the presence of
disorder. The corresponding expressions could be formally obtained in the form of inﬁnite series of diagrams with
diﬀerent number of insertions, representing scatterings on impurities, i.e.,

where the dashed line represents the impurity correlation function (11) and the double solid line represents the
disorder-averaged quasiparticle propagators hGidis. In the rainbow approximation, the latter is given by

hGidis ≡

.

(50)

It should be noted that, in the last equation, we ignored a correction to the self-energy linear in the impurity potential.
As we will show in Sec. V A, it has the form Σ(1) = nimpu0. The eﬀect of such a term is to shift the value of the
chemical potential, µ∗ = µ − nimpu0. Clearly, such a redeﬁnition has no qualitative importance and, thus, will be
ignored.
In three-dimensional systems, the contributions of the diagrams with crossing impurity lines, e.g., see the second
row of diagrams in Eq. (49), are usually suppressed compared to the diagrams without crossing lines [47]. Since in
the present model there are no strict one-dimensional chiral fermions that are fully decoupled from the bulk states, its
dynamics should be close to a three dymensional one. Therefore one could expect that omitting the impurity-crossing
diagrams should provide at least a reasonable approximation in this case.

Then, the current-current correlation function takes the following diagrammatic form:

where we introduced the vertex function in the ladder approximation:

Λx (ω; r1, r′, r2) ≡

The corresponding explicit expression reads

in the following form:

In this study we are interested in the DC electrical conductivity. By taking into account that the corresponding
transport coeﬃcient describes the linear response of the system to a spatially homogeneous electric ﬁeld, we set
qk = 0. Then, the vertex function satisﬁes the following equation:

Λx(cid:0)ω; kk, kk, y1, y′, y2(cid:1) = σxδ(y1 − y′)δ(y′ − y2) +Z

(56)

In order to calculate the conductivity in this approximation, therefore, we would ﬁrst need to calculate the full
quasiparticle propagator averaged over the disorder and then solve Eq. (56) for the full vertex function. Finally, the
knowledge of the propagator and vertex will allow us to derive the expression for the correlator (55) and, therefore,
the conductivity (54). Thus, in the next two subsections, we calculate both of them using standard methods.

A. Self-energy and full quasiparticle propagator

In this subsection we calculate the self-energy and determine the width of the Fermi arc states in the full model
(1). To start with, let us remind that the surface and bulk Green’s functions in the absence of disorder are given by
Eqs. (32) and (33), respectively.

Here we will determine the full Green’s function for the surface states by calculating their self-energy to the quadratic
order in the disorder strength u0. Formally, the deﬁnition for the self-energy is the same as in Eq. (24). However,
one has to keep in mind that the internal quasiparticle propagator in the corresponding diagram could be either the
surface or bulk one. Therefore, there are diﬀerent types of contributions to the ﬁnal result coming from the diagrams
with the bulk or surface internal lines.

By expanding the full Green’s function to the second order in powers of the disorder strength u0, see Eqs. (48) and

(50), we derive the following result:

Let us note that, in order to extract the correct deﬁnition of the self-energy from this result, it is instructive to
compare the above expression with the formal expansion of the surface Green’s function to linear order in Σ(kz),

p(kz)(1 + σx)e−(y+y′)p(kz )
ω + µ − vF kx − Σ(kz)

Here we took into account that (1 + σx)2 = 2(1 + σx). By comparing this expansion with the result in Eq. (60), we
extract the following ﬁrst order correction to the real part of self energy:

ω + µ − vF kx
= (−i)Ss(ω, kk; y′, y) +

e(y+y′)p(kz )

2p(kz)

This result is qualitatively the same as the leading order correction to the self-energy in three dimensional theories
[47]. Its eﬀect is to shift the chemical potential from µ to µ∗, where

Σ(1)(kk) = nimpu0.

(62)

µ∗ ≡ µ − Σ(1)(kk) = µ − nimpu0.

(63)

In the remainder of this paper, we will ignore this correction to the chemical potential (or the diﬀerence between µ
and µ∗) due to its qualitative unimportance.

Next, we calculate the second order correction S(2)(ω, kk, k′

Here we took into account the retarded nature of the Green’s functions and used the ﬁniteness of the z-component

In this subsection we calculate the full vertex function in the ladder approximation. The explicit form of the

equation for the vertex (56) reads

Λx(cid:0)ω; kk, kk, y1, y′, y2(cid:1) = σxδ(y1 − y2)δ(y′ − y1) + nimpu2

The matrix structure on the right hand side of the above equation suggests that the solution for the vertex function
should take the following form:

f (ω, y1, y′).

(76)

By substituting such an ansatz into Eq. (75), we ﬁnd that the unknown function f (ω, y1, y′) should satisfy the following
equation:

where

f (ω, y1, y′) = F (ω, y1, y′) +Z dy′1F (ω, y1, y′1)f (ω, y′1, y′),

and b(0) = 0.004 ˚A−2

.

Eq. (77) is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. When the norm of the kernel is suﬃciently small, i.e.,

its solution can be obtained by iterations. The formal result in this case reads

C. Fermi arc conductivity

By combining the results of the previous two subsections, in this subsection we calculate the conductivity of the

Fermi arc states.

We start by presenting the mixed coordinate-momentum space representation of the spectral function for the surface

Fermi arc states,

by using the relation in Eq. (16).

The xx-component of the DC conductivity tensor is deﬁned by Eq. (54) evaluated at qk = 0. By making use of the
Green’s function representation in terms of the spectral function (83), we rewrite the expression for the conductivity
as follows:

is suﬃcient for calculating the real part of the DC conductivity.

, respectively.

The left panel in Fig. 6 shows the real part of the conductivity as a function of the (dimensional) distance y,
measured from the surface into the bulk. The result is shown for a ﬁxed value of the chemical potential, µ = 0.05 eV.
This choice of µ is suﬃciently large to be still marginally in the regime of reliable perturbative calculations, where
the vertex correction is not too large. This is also conﬁrmed by the fact that the leading order result dominates the

17

total conductivity. From the functional dependence we see that, as expected, the Fermi arc conductivity takes the
highest value on the surface (y = 0) and rapidly decreases as the function of y.

The dependence of the conductivity on the dimensionless chiral shift parameter (or the arcs length) γm/µ is shown
in the middle panel of Fig. 6. The results are plotted for y = 0 and the same ﬁxed value of the chemical potential,
µ = 0.05 eV. Despite the fact that the quasiparticle width (68) has a very nontrivially dependence on the chiral shift
parameter m, the conductivity appears to always grow with m. It is also interesting to note that the slopes of the
functional dependence are diﬀerent at small and large values of γm/µ, showing a characteristic (van Hove) kink at
m = µ/γ. The existence of such a kink can be explained by the Lifshitz transition [48]. Indeed, as one can see from
the left panel of Fig. 1, two disjoined sheets of the Fermi surface merge into a single one at m = µ/γ resulting in the
van Hove kink. Note that the corresponding phenomenon was observed in three-dimensional Dirac semimetal Na3Bi
[49].

The right panel in Fig. 6 shows the conductivity as a function of the (dimensional) chemical potential µ at ﬁxed
position y = 0 (on the surface). One of the main features of the corresponding result is that the total surface
conductivity decreases with µ. At ﬁrst sight, this may appear counterintuitive. However, this is indeed the case and
the explanation is quite simple. Because of the speciﬁc mechanism of dissipation, i.e., scattering of the surface Fermi
arc states into the bulk, the width of surface quasiparticles grows when the density of bulk states increases. Indeed,
such an increase expands the available phase space for scattered states into the bulk and, thus, damps the surface
conductivity.

From the functional dependence of the conductivity on the chemical potential shown in the right panel of Fig. 6,
In agreement with our analytical estimates in Sec. V B, the validity of the

perturbative regime is limited only to the case of suﬃciently large energies, or chemical potentials, µγ/v2

where the vertex corrections are under control. For smaller values of µ, a nonperturbative solution of the integral
equation for the vertex function (77) is needed. This is also supported by the calculated dependence of the surface
conductivity on µ, which reveals that the leading order conductivity and the ﬁrst correction become comparable at
µγ/v2

F ≪ 0.05.

The ﬁnite temperature results for the conductivity due to surface Fermi arc states are shown in Fig. 7 for y = 0
and several representative values of parameters. By comparing the temperature dependence of the conductivity at
diﬀerent values of the chemical potentials, we ﬁnd that there are two qualitatively diﬀerent dynamical regimes. At
suﬃciently small values of µ (i.e., µγ/v2
F . 0.06), the conductivity monotonically decreases with temperature. At
larger values, there is a nonmonotonic dependence with a local maximum at a temperature that scales approximately
as the chemical potential,

The underlying reason for the nonmonotonic behavior of the conductivity and the location of the maximum around
Tpeak are not completely transparent from the details of our analysis. It is natural to expect, however, that the roots
of this dependence lie in the underlying mechanism of the dissipation of the surface states.

VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In this paper, we addressed the question whether the charge transport of the Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals is
dissipative or non-dissipative. Because of the topologically protected nature of the surface Fermi arc states, one would
naively expect that the Fermi arc transport should be non-dissipative. We found, however, that the transport is,
in fact, dissipative. The fundamental physical reason for the dissipation is the presence of gapless bulk states in
Weyl semimetals, whose low-energy dynamics is not fully decoupled from the surface Fermi arc states. Indeed, by
making use of the simplest model of a short-ranged quenched disorder, we showed that the Fermi arc quasiparticles
can scatter into the bulk states in addition to scattering into other surface Fermi arc states. This nondecoupling
implies that there is no well-deﬁned eﬀective theory of Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals in the presence of quenched
disorder. The electronic scattering from the surface into the bulk and vice versa leads to the dephasing of the Fermi
arc quasiparticles and dissipation. This is in contrast to the case of topological insulators, in which bulk states are
gapped. It appears that our ﬁndings agree with the generic conclusions in Refs. [31, 42], claiming that an eﬀective
theory of surface states in gapless systems can not be formulated.

We calculated the Fermi arc conductivity of Weyl semimetals by making use of the Kubo linear-response theory
and a simple continuum model of a semiinﬁnite Weyl semimetal with a pair of Weyl nodes. We calculated explicitly
the Fermi arc quasiparticle width and found that there are contributions due to (i) the intra-arc scattering and (ii)
the bulk dephasing of the Fermi arc states [see, Eqs. (68) and (72), respectively]. Furthermore, we calculated the
Fermi arc conductivity explicitly and conﬁrmed that the scattering of the Fermi arc quasiparticles into the bulk ones
is indeed responsible for the dissipative transport. In the analysis, we used the current-current correlator with the
vertex correction in the ladder approximation. We also showed that the corresponding correction may be important
in certain regions of the parameter space.

Our results reveal that the Fermi arc conductivity at zero temperature decreases with the growth of chemical
potential (see, the right panel of Fig. 6). This is explained by the associated increase of the Fermi arc quasiparticle
width that grows with the density of states in the bulk. By noting that the ladder approximation for the vertex
gradually deteriorates at small values of chemical potential µ, our results for the conductivity are quantitatively
reliable only at suﬃciently large µ. The results at small (vanishing) values of chemical potential µ should, therefore,
be treated as an extrapolation. We hope that it would be possible to address the corresponding regime in the future
by using a non-perturbative resummation for the vertex function. In this paper, we also analyzed the temperature
dependence of the Fermi arc conductivity, which appears to be a decreasing function of T when the chemical potential
is suﬃciently small (i.e., µγ/v2
F . 0.06). At larger value of µ, the temperature dependence of the conductivity is
nonmonotonic with a local maximum at a temperature that scales approximately as the chemical potential, see Fig. 7.
This suggests a certain nontrivial competition between the phase space of the bulk states and the thermal eﬀects.
The precise nature of the corresponding mechanism, however, remains somewhat elusive. We hope to consider this
issue in more detail somewhere else.

As we showed in our study, the region of small chemical potential µ is peculiar. This is due to the fact that
the vertex function becomes large in the region of small energies and the leading-order perturbative treatment is
insuﬃcient. In this case, a nonperturbative analysis of the integral equation for the vertex (75) is needed. Finally,
there is an interesting question what happens in the case where the chemical potential is zero. Since the Fermi arc
width decreases as chemical potential decrease, one would naively think that the Fermi arc conductivity blows up at
µ → 0. However, according to the studies performed in Refs. [50] and [51], there is still a non-zero density of the bulk
states in a disordered Weyl semimetal at zero chemical potential. In the case of charged impurities, the nonvanishing
bulk density of states is realized due to the formation of electron/hole puddles [51]. The low energy behaviour of a

19

Weyl semimetal with local impurities is dominated by rare region eﬀects, which are essentially nonperturbative [50].
Thus, the bulk states in disordered Weyl semimetals are present even at zero chemical potential. This suggests that
the Fermi arc states always couple to the bulk ones, and the Fermi arc conductivity is always ﬁnite.

As is clear, the model used in this paper is quite simple and may not describe perfectly the transport of the Fermi
arcs in real materials. In order to fully appreciate its strengths and limitations, therefore, it is pertinent to discuss the
features of the model in more detail. For the sake of clarity, we studied a model with only one Fermi arc. In realistic
Weyl semimetals (e.g., TaAs, TaP, NbAs, and NbP) there are usually more Fermi arcs, sometimes up to 12 [8, 9]. For
the dissipation mechanism that we discussed, this is not very important, of course. However, the existence of numerous
arcs opens the possibility for scattering processes between diﬀerent Fermi arcs. Qualitatively, such additional processes
can only increase surface quasiparticle width and, therefore, reduce the conductivity. It is also worth noting that the
real Fermi arcs have nontrivial spin polarization [1, 29, 52]. This feature is left out in our model. Whether the spin
texture of Fermi arc states is relevant for the Fermi arc transport is probably a material dependent property. In this
connection, we would like to note that, according to the recent experimental results in Ref. [34], the spin texture does
play a qualitative, although minor, role in TaAs. We assumed also that impurities are dilute so that our perturbative
treatment of the self-energy and the current-current correlator is justiﬁed. In the regime of strong disorder, one should
use a self-consistent Born approximation, renormalization group, or other non-perturbative techniques. In addition,
the localization eﬀects should be taken into account at large disorder strength.
