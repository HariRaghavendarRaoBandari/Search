Abstract

We discuss the production of ultra high energy neutrinos coming from the propagation of ultra high energy cosmic
rays and in the framework of top-down models for the production of these extremely energetic particles. We show
the importance of the detection of ultra high energy neutrinos that can be a fundamental diagnostic tool to solve the
discrepancy in the observed chemical composition of ultra high energy cosmic rays and, at the extreme energies, can
unveil new physics in connection with the recent cosmological observations of the possible presence of tensor modes
in the ﬂuctuation pattern of the cosmic microwave background.

Keywords: Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, Ultra High Energy Neutrinos, Super Heavy Dark Matter

1. Introduction

Ultra High energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) are the
most energetic particles observed in nature, with ener-
gies up to 1020 eV. The experimental and theoretical
study of UHECR have brought several important re-
sults, such as [1, 2, 3]: (i) UHECRs are charged par-
ticles, with limits on neutral particles up to 1019 eV at
the level of few percent for photons and well below for
neutrinos [4, 5, 6], (ii) the spectra observed on Earth
show a slight ﬂattening at energies around 5 × 1018 eV
(called the ankle), with (iii) a steep suppression at the
highest energies around 1020 eV.

One of the key informations in the physics of cosmic
rays in general and UHECR in particular is the com-
position of this radiation. In this respect, experimental
observations are still not conclusive. The Pierre Auger
Observatory (Auger) [7], far the largest detector devoted
to the observation of UHECR, points toward a mixed
composition with light (proton and He) elements dom-
inating the low energy tail of the spectra and a heavier
composition at the highest energies, that starts around
energies 5 × 1018 eV. On the other hand, Telescope Ar-
ray (TA) [8], even if with 1/10 of the Auger statistics,
claims a proton dominated composition at all energies

up to the highest observed.

The actual chemical composition of UHECR is a key
information in order to understand the physical mech-
anisms responsible for the acceleration of this particles
and, ultimately, to tag their sources. The production of
secondary particles, such as neutrinos or gamma rays,
is due to the interaction of UHECR with astrophysi-
cal backgrounds during propagation and, being strongly
tied with UHECR chemical composition, can be of
paramount importance to solve the alleged contradic-
tion between Auger and TA observations. In this paper
we will review secondary neutrino production bracket-
ing the expectations connected with diﬀerent assump-
tion on chemical composition.

On more general grounds, the fraction of neutrinos
(and gamma-rays) observed in the spectra of UHECR
at energies till 1019 eV, as stated above, is extremely
small with only upper limits and no direct observations.
Nonetheless, the observations of Auger and TA at the
highest energies are still aﬀected by a reduced number
of events. For instance, Auger, with the highest statis-
tics, has only 5 events at energies around 1020 eV [9].
This energy range is of paramount importance in order
to unveil possible top-down mechanism in the produc-
tion of UHECR connected with new physics at the in-

ﬂation scale.

The recent claim by BICEP2 of a substantial contri-
bution of tensor modes to the ﬂuctuation pattern of the
Cosmic Microwave Background, even if reconsidered
after the combined analysis with Planck and Keck array
[10], boosted the possible explanation of the Dark Mat-
ter problem in terms of Super Heavy Dark Matter, i.e.
relic particles created by rapidly varying gravitational
ﬁelds during inﬂation (see [11] and reference therein).
One of the key expectations of this kind of models is the
huge amount of neutrinos (and gamma-rays) produced
at energies (cid:38) 1020 eV [12].
In the present paper we
will review recent results that link cosmological obser-
vations to the ﬂuxes of neutrinos expected at the highest
energies, also assessing the detection capabilities of fu-
ture UHECR and neutrino observatories.

2. Secondary cosmogenic neutrinos

The physics of UHECR propagation is well under-
stood [13, 14, 15]. During their journey from the
source to the observer UHECR experience interactions
with astrophysical backgrounds1, namely the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) and the Extragalactic
Background Light (EBL). The propagation of UHECR
protons2 is aﬀected almost only by the CMB radiation
ﬁeld and the processes that inﬂuence the propagation
are: (i) pair production and (ii) photo-pion production
[15, 16]. On the other hand, the propagation of heav-
ier nuclei is aﬀected also by the EBL and the interac-
tion processes relevant are: (i) pair production and (ii)
photo-disintegration [13, 14, 17, 18].

The interaction processes that involve UHECRs with
background photons are important not only as mecha-
nisms of energy losses aﬀecting the behaviour of the
propagating particles but also being the source of sec-
ondary particles such as neutrinos, gamma-rays and
electron-positron pairs. Here we will focus mainly on
the production of secondary neutrinos. The main source
of these particles is certainly the process of photo-pion
production. A nucleon (N), whether free or bounded in
a nucleus, with Lorentz factor Γ (cid:38) 1010 interacting with
the CMB photons gives rise to the photo-pion produc-
tion process:

N + γ → N(cid:48) + π0

N + γ → N(cid:48) + π

1We will not consider here the interaction with extragalactic mag-

netic ﬁelds, whose presence is not clear and yet under discussion.

2Hereafter discussing freely propagating UHE nucleons we will
always refer only to protons because the decay time of neutrons is
much shorter than all other time scales involved [13, 14, 15].

At lower energies Γ < 1010, even if with a lower proba-
bility, the same processes can occur on the EBL ﬁeld. In
the case of UHE protons propagating in the CMB, the
photo-pion production process involves a sizeable en-
ergy loss producing the so-called GZK cut-oﬀ [19, 20],
a sharp suppression of the ﬂux of protons expected on
Earth at E (cid:39) 6 × 1019 eV.

The photo-pion production process holds also for nu-
cleons bound within UHE nuclei, being the interact-
ing nucleon ejected from the parent nucleus, but this
process is subdominant with respect to nucleus photo-
disintegration except at extremely high energies [15].

UHE nuclei propagating through astrophysical back-
grounds can be stripped of one or more nucleons by the
interactions with CMB and EBL photons, giving rise to
the process of photo-disintegration:

(A, Z) + γ → (A − n, Z − n(cid:48)) + nN

(2)
n (n(cid:48)) being the number of stripped nucleons (protons).
In the nucleus rest frame the energy involved in such
processes is usually much less than the rest mass of the
nucleus itself, therefore in the laboratory frame we can
neglect the nucleus recoil.

Let us now concentrate on the unstable particles (pi-
ons, free neutrons and unstable nuclei) produced by the
propagation of UHECRs through photo-pion production
and photo-disintegration. In most cases the decay length
of such particles is much shorter than all other relevant
length scales, so these particles decay very soon giving
rise to secondary neutrinos.

There are two processes by which neutrinos can be

produced in the propagation of UHECRs:

• the decay of charged pions produced by photo-pion
production, π± → µ± + νµ(¯νµ), and the subsequent
muon decay µ± → e± + ¯νµ(νµ) + νe(¯νe);

• the beta decay of neutrons and nuclei produced by
photo-disintegration: n → p + e− + ¯νe, (A, Z) →
(A, Z − 1) + e+ + νe, or (A, Z) → (A, Z + 1) + e− + ¯νe.
These processes produce neutrinos in diﬀerent energy
ranges:
in the former the energy of each neutrino is
around a few percent of that of the parent nucleon,
whereas in the latter it is less than one part per thousand
(in the case of neutron decay, larger for certain unstable
nuclei). This means that in the interactions with CMB
photons, which have a threshold around Γ (cid:38) 1010, neu-
trinos are produced with energies of the order of 1018 eV
and 1016 eV respectively.

Interactions with EBL photons contribute with a
much lower probability than CMB photons, aﬀecting

a small fraction of the propagating protons and nu-
clei. Neutrinos produced through interactions with
EBL, characterised by lower thresholds, have energies
of the order of 1015 eV in the case of photo-pion pro-
duction and 1014 eV in the case of neutron decay.

Being weak interacting particles neutrinos, once pro-
duced, reach the earth from all over the universe. This is
an important point that makes neutrinos a viable probe
not only of the chemical composition of UHECRs but
also of the cosmological evolution of sources that, as
we will show below, can be also constrained by the neu-
trino ﬂux observed on Earth. Following [23], we will
consider the case of sources with no cosmological evo-
lution, with the same cosmological evolution as that of
active galactic nuclei (AGN), an astrophysical object
supposed to play a role in particle acceleration to the
highest energies [16], and with the cosmological evolu-
tion of the star formation rate (SFR).

All computations are performed under the assump-
tion of a homogenous distribution of sources. This as-
sumption does not aﬀect the expected neutrino spectra
because in the case of neutrinos the overall universe, up
to the maximum redshift, contributes to the ﬂuxes and
possible ﬂux variations due to a local inhomogeneity in
source distribution gives a negligible contribution to the
total ﬂux. We also ﬁx a maximum redshift of the sources
zmax = 10, which is the typical redshift of the ﬁrst stars
(pop III) [21]. In any case the expected ﬂuxes of pri-
mary and secondary particles are almost independent of
zmax if zmax > 3 [22, 23].

Figure 2: Fluxes of secondary neutrinos, corresponding to the ﬂuxes
of ﬁgure 1 with the same color code, coloured bands show the un-
certainties connected with the EBL evolution model considered. Thin
solid lines are the neutrino ﬂuxes obtained neglecting the contribution
of the EBL radiation ﬁeld.

Once produced at cosmological distances neutrinos
travel toward the observer almost freely, the opacity of
the universe to neutrinos being relevant only at the red-
shifts z > 10 [24, 25]. Therefore, given the assumptions
discussed above, in our computations we have neglected
any eﬀect due to neutrino propagation apart from the
adiabatic energy losses due to the expansion of the uni-
verse.

As discussed in the introduction, the experimental ev-
idences about UHECR chemical composition are not
conclusive with the two opposite scenarios claimed by
TA and Auger. To bracket the expectations in terms of
secondary neutrinos we have considered both scenarios
of proton-dominated ﬂux (dip model) and mixed com-
position with heavy nuclei contributing to the ﬂux of
UHECR. The results discussed here were already pre-
sented elsewhere [23] and obtained using the Monte
Carlo code SimProp [26], properly upgraded to com-
pute the production of secondary neutrinos.

2.1. Dip model

Retaining the results claimed by TA, under the as-
sumption of pure protons the observations can be very
well described in the framework of the dip model
[16, 27], which explains the features observed in the
UHECR’s spectrum in terms of the sole proton inter-
actions with the CMB background. As discussed above,
the eﬀect of EBL on proton propagation has an impor-
tant role for the production of secondary neutrinos, but
it negligibly aﬀects the expected proton ﬂux.

and Kascade-Grande (blue ﬁlled triangles) together with
the theoretical ﬂuxes as computed in the framework of
the dip model taking the three diﬀerent cases of sources
cosmological evolution as outlined above. In ﬁgure 2
we show the ﬂuxes of secondary neutrinos correspond-
ing to the UHECR ﬂuxes of ﬁgure 1, with the same color
code, together with the IceCube observations [28] and
the experimental limits on the neutrino ﬂux of Auger
[29].

As expected a pure proton composition gives a size-
able ﬂux of secondary neutrinos that, at least in the case
of strong cosmological evolution, is already at the level
of being detected by both IceCube and Auger. This is a
non-trivial result that shows how the future detection of
UHE neutrinos can be of paramount importance in the
physics of UHECR.

2.2. Mixed composition

Changing point of view, taking for granted the results
claimed by Auger with heavier composition at increas-
ing energy, the observations can be explained only in
terms of a more complicated phenomenology. The an-
kle feature will be related to a change in the source fam-
ily contributing to the ﬂux [23, 30, 31] or to speciﬁc
dynamic at the source [32, 33].

Taking the model presented in [23, 30] in ﬁgure 3 we
plot the ﬂux of UHECR together with the experimen-
tal data of Kascade-Grande, Auger and TA, in ﬁgure 4
we plot the corresponding ﬂux of secondary neutrinos.
The production of secondary neutrinos in this case is re-
stricted only to PeV energies and comes from the photo-
pion production process on the EBL radiation ﬁeld suf-
fered by protons of the low energy tail of UHECR. In

this case the highest energy part of the UHECR spec-
trum, being dominated by heavy nuclei, does not show
any signiﬁcant contribution to the production of sec-
ondary neutrinos.

3. Super heavy dark matter

One of the most fundamental and longstanding prob-
lems in modern physics is certainly the presence of a
yet-not-observed form of matter whose presence is de-
tected only through its gravitational interaction: the so-
called Dark Matter (DM) [34]. The leading paradigm
to explain DM observations is based on the Weakly In-
teractive Massive Particle (WIMP) hypothesys, which
consists of two basic assumptions: (i) WIMPs are sta-
ble particles of mass Mχ that interact weakly with the
Standard Model (SM) particles; (ii) WIMPs are ther-
mal relics, i.e. they were in Local Thermal Equilibrium
(LTE) in the early Universe. Imposing that the WIMP
density today is at the observed DM level, using a sim-
ple unitarity argument for the WIMP annihilation cross
section σann (cid:39) 1/M2
χ, one obtains an estimate of the
WIMP mass in the range of 102 to 104 GeV. This result,
also called the WIMP miracle, links the DM problem to
the new physics scale expected in the context of the nat-
uralness argument for electroweak physics. Triggering
in this way the strong hope that the search for WIMP
DM may be connected to the discovery of new physics
at the TeV scale.

Searches for WIMP particles are ongoing through
three diﬀerent routes: direct detection, indirect detec-
tion, and accelerator searches [34]. None of these eﬀorts
have discovered a clear WIMP candidate so far. In ad-
dition, no evidence for new physics has been observed

at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Although not yet
conclusive, the lack of evidence for WIMPs may imply
a diﬀerent solution for the DM problem outside of the
WIMP paradigm.

Following [12], here we will reconsider the scenario
based on particle production due to time varying grav-
itational ﬁelds: the so-called Super Heavy Dark Matter
(SHDM) scenario. This alternative approach is based
on the possibility of particle production due to the non-
adiabatic expansion of the background space-time act-
ing on the vacuum quantum ﬂuctuations. It is remark-
able the fact that the ﬁrst attempt to apply such a mech-
anism in Cosmology dates back to E. Schr¨odinger in
1936 [35]. More recently, in the framework of inﬂa-
tionary cosmologies, it was shown that particle creation
is a common phenomenon, not tied to any speciﬁc cos-
mological scenario, that can play a crucial role in the
solution to the DM problem as SHDM (labeled by X)
can have ΩX(t0) (cid:46) 1 (see [12] and references therein).
This conclusion can be drawn under three general hy-
potheses: (i) SHDM in the early Universe never reaches
LTE; (ii) SHDM particles have mass of the order of the
inﬂaton mass, Mφ; and (iii) SHDM particles are long-
living particles with a lifetime exceeding the age of the
Universe, τX (cid:29) t0. These three hypothesis can be tested
experimentally through cosmological and UHECR ob-
servations.

The observations of CMB ﬂuctuations can be directly
linked to the primordial density ﬂuctuations in the early
universe. These ﬂuctuations are of two types: curva-
ture and iso-curvature. The ﬁrst being connected with
the total energy density in the early universe while the
second with the actual composition of the energy den-
sity itself. The fact that SHDM particles, with mass

MX of the order of the inﬂaton mass Mφ, never reach
LTE implies a relevant contribution of these particles to
the iso-curvature perturbations [36] that are a source of
gravitational potential therefore contributing to the pri-
mordial gravitational waves background with a tensor
to scalar ratio r > 0 in the CMB ﬂuctuations. This is
an unavoidable consequence of any particle production
through time varying gravitational ﬁelds. In this sense
the recent claim by BICEP2, that claimed a measured
value of r = 0.2+0.07−0.05 [37], triggered a renewed interest
for the SHDM hypothesis as a viable alternative to the
WIMP paradigm. The result claimed by BICEP was re-
considered in the light of a common analysis including
Planck and Keck array observations [10], validated on
simulations of a dust-only modelling and performed by
a simple subtraction of scaled spectra. The ﬁnal result
of this combined analysis showed a substantial reduc-
tion of the tensor modes in the CMB background with
an upper limit r ≤ 0.12, at 95% conﬁdence level, and
a likelihood curve that peaks at r = 0.05 but disfavours
zero with a scarce statistical signiﬁcance. In the near fu-
ture several diﬀerent detectors, both ground-based and
sub-orbital, will take data at a variety of frequency en-
abling a more precise determination of the CMB pri-
mordial tensor modes.

Assuming a non-negligible value of the tensor to
scalar ratio r in the CMB ﬂuctuations, one gets the scale
of the inﬂaton mass Mφ and, requiring that the SHDM
density today corresponds to the observed DM density
ΩX = ΩDM, one obtains the scale of the SHDM mass
MX. Following the computations of [12], assuming an
inﬂaton potential of the type V(φ) = φβM4−β
φ /β with
β = 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2, in ﬁgure 5 we show the inﬂaton mass

Mφ as function of r and in ﬁgure 6 the corresponding
SHDM mass MX.

As discussed in [12], the result presented in ﬁgures 5
and 6 also depends on the assumption about the reheat-
ing temperature TRH that was assumed to be TRH = 109
GeV. For instance, in the case of an inﬂaton potential
β = 2 the equation ΩX = ΩDM = 0.261 has no solution
for r < 3 × 10−3 with our choice of TRH = 109 GeV. In
this case, as discussed in [36], there is a lower bound on
the reheating temperature. Fixing TRH at its minimum
the equation ΩX = ΩDM shows no solutions only for
a tensor to scalar ratio r < 2 × 10−2 while usng larger
values of r the ratio MX/Mφ diﬀers by not more than
50% from the result of ﬁgure 6. In the other cases of
β = 2/3, 1, 4/3 there is no lower bound on TRH and as-
suming TRH in the range that spans from 105÷1010 GeV
the solution of ΩX = ΩDM still diﬀers by not more than
50% from the solution plotted in ﬁgure 6. A change in
MX at the level of a factor 2 does not change the conclu-
sion presented here, therefore we can keep TRH = 109
GeV as a reference value.

The limits on the SHDM models that come from the
experimental limits on the iso-curvature perturbation of
the CMB are also satisﬁed as shown by [36, 38]. This
follows from ﬁgure 6 where the ratio MX/Mφ needed to
obtain the observed DM density today is in the range
2 ÷ 15 almost independently of the choice of TRH [12].
From ﬁgures 5 and 6 we can conclude that SHDM
particles production by time-varying gravitational ﬁelds
provide a viable explanation of the DM problem even

with a ratio of tensor to scalar modes at the level of 10−3.
This result still depends on the assumption of a long-
living SHDM with a particle life-time τX much longer
than the age of the Universe. This last hypothesis can
be tested through UHECR experiments by detecting the
decay products of SHDM.

Following [11], on very general grounds, we can as-
sume that SHDM decay gives rise to a quark anti-quark
pair with subsequent parton cascades that, hadronizing,
produce Standard Model (SM) particles. The basic sig-
natures of these kind of decays are three: (i) SHDM (as
any other DM particle) cluster gravitationally and accu-
mulate in the halo of our Galaxy with an average den-
X (cid:39) 0.3 GeV/cm3; (ii) in the hadronic cascades
sity ρhalo
the most abundant particles produced are pions, there-
fore UHE neutrinos and gamma-rays are the most abun-
dant particles expected on Earth, (iii) The non-central
position of the Sun in the galactic halo results in an
anisotropic ﬂux of the decay products [39].

The quantitative prediction for energy spectra and
chemical composition of UHECR pruduced in SHDM
decay require an extrapolation of QCD calculations
from the TeV scale up to MX. There are several dif-
ferent recipes discussed in literature based on both MC
and analytical computations (see [11, 12] and references
therein) all giving the same behaviour of the expected
ﬂuxes dN/dE ∝ E−1.9, independently of the particle
type, with a photon/nucleon fraction γ/N (cid:39) 2 ÷ 3 and
a neutrino/nucleon fraction ν/N (cid:39) 3 ÷ 4, quite indepen-
dent of the energy.

where MX and τX are the mass and life-time of the
SHDM particle, dN/dE is the energy spectrum of the
decay products and ρX(R) is the SHDM density in the
galactic halo as function of the distance R from the
Galactic Center. Here we will assume a DM density
proﬁle as comes from numerical simulations by Moore
(see [12] and references therein).

As discussed in [12], the expected ﬂux of UHE parti-
cles coming from the SHDM decay can be computed as
the integral over the line of sight of the emissivity (3).
In the case of neutrinos, together with particles coming
from the local halo, it is also relevant the contribution of
the whole universe that is at the level of 10% of the ﬂux
coming from our own galaxy [12].

Tacking into account the contribution of protons,
gammas and neutrinos produced by SHDM decay, in
ﬁgure 7 we plot the ﬂux of UHECR summing the con-
tribution of the mixed composition model of [23, 30] to
that coming from SHDM. In ﬁgure 7 we also plot the
experimental data of Auger (red points) and TA (black
points) and the expected sensitivities of ARA (thick
solid blu line), a future neutrino observatory based on
the Askarian eﬀect [40], and JEM-EUSO (thick solid
red line), an UHECR detector planned onboard the in-
ternational space station [41]. The ﬂuxes of UHECR
produced by SHDM decay are plotted as solid lines (red
for neutrinos, blu for gamma-rays and green from pro-
tons), these ﬂuxes are obtained in the case of an inﬂa-
tionary potential β = 2 and a ratio of tensor to scalar
modes r = 0.05 that corresponds to a SHDM mass
MX = 4.5× 1013 GeV (as labeled in the plot). The value
of τX = 2.2 × 1022 y in ﬁgure 7 is ﬁxed in order not
to overshoot the Auger limits on gamma-rays at (cid:46) 1019
eV.

From ﬁgure 7 follows that future observatories of
UHECRs and neutrinos should be able to discover
SHDM or constrain its lifetimes. The EUSO detector
seems particularly suited for these kind of studies as it
achieves about an order of magnitude higher exposure at
1020 eV respect to Auger. The most striking signature
of SHDM models is represented by the peculiar com-
position of UHECR at the highest energies, with a ﬂux
dominated by neutrinos and gamma-rays. This signa-
ture is a precise outcome of the sole decaying dynamics
of SHDM particles [11] and it is shown in ﬁgure 8 where
the ratio of neutrinos, gamma-rays and protons coming
from SHDM decays is plotted.

The observation of UHE neutrinos, starting from PeV
energies up to the highest, is a new window through
which we can observe the Universe. This window,
recently opened by the IceCube observations of PeV
neutrinos, is of paramount importance from many as-
pects. Here we have reviewed the tight relationship that
links UHECR and UHE neutrinos. We have consid-
ered two diﬀerent, possible, sources of UHE neutrinos:
namely those coming from the propagation of UHECR
and those coming from the decay of SHDM.

Neutrinos coming from the propagation of UHECR
originate mainly by the decay of charged pions pro-
duced by photo-hadronic interactions of protons and
heavy nuclei with CMB and EBL backgrounds. As
sources of neutrinos, these processes are eﬃcient only
in the case of protons while in the case of heavier nu-
clei photo-hadronic interactions are signiﬁcantly sup-
pressed. This is an important outcome that signals the
strong link between UHECR chemical composition and
the observation of UHE neutrinos.

The light composition of the low energy tail of
UHECR is observed with a solid consensus by all de-
tectors. Therefore a ﬂux of UHE (cosmogenic) neutri-
nos in the PeV energy range is assured, these particles
come from the photo-pion production process suﬀered
by EeV protons on the EBL photons. The remaining ig-
norance in predicting the ﬂux of neutrinos is connected
with the cosmological evolution of sources and, to a
lesser extent, with the uncertainties in the cosmological
evolution of the EBL background itself. Models with
a strong cosmological evolution of sources, as in the
case of AGN, produce a neutrino ﬂux almost at the level
of the IceCube observations in the PeV region. This
fact already enables a partial constraining of cosmolog-
ical evolution of sources, disfavouring models with too
strong evolution.

At the highest (EeV) energies the ﬂux of cosmogenic
neutrinos mainly originates from the highest energy tail
of the UHECR spectrum. If the most energetic cosmic
rays, at around 1020 eV, are mainly protons, then a size-
able ﬂux of EeV neutrinos will be produced.
In this
case, as before, the experimental limits on EeV neutri-
nos can be used to constrain the cosmological evolution
of sources. For instance, Auger limits on neutrino ﬂuxes
already disfavour too strong evolution models and mod-
erate cosmological evolution can be tested by future
UHE neutrino detectors. Conversely, if the highest en-
ergy tail of UHECRs is composed mainly of heavy nu-
clei, as in models reproducing Auger data on spectrum
and chemical composition, then the ﬂux of cosmogenic

EeV neutrinos is far below the detection threshold of
any running or planned detector.

The observation of UHE neutrinos is also important
to test new physics models, as those connected with
SHDM and Cosmology. The BICEP program revived
the notion that the primordial B-mode polarization may
be higher than previously expected. However, Planck
showed that subtracting foreground contamination by
dust is also more challenging than past estimates. The
joint Planck, BICEP2, and Keck Array analysis set an
upper limit on r while mildly pointing towards a non-
zero value.

Given the large interest in the community and the
ability of next generation experiments to surpass cur-
rent challenges, it is likely that the fundamental mea-
surement of r will be reached in the near future. Rela-
tively large values of r, at the level r > 10−3, motivate
the idea that dark matter is mainly composed of super-
heavy relics from the inﬂationary epoch. Given a mea-
surement of r, the existence of SHDM can best be tested
by exploring the decay lifetime parameter range with
future UHECR observatories. The higher the statistics
of UHECR experiments at energies around 1020 eV, the
more likely the detection of SM particles produced by
SHDM decay. Given the currently planned UHECR and
UHE neutrino detectors, JEM-EUSO is best placed to
eﬀectively study the allowed SHDM lifetimes with pos-
sible lifetime detections or constraints reaching values
as high as τX (cid:39) 1024 y.
