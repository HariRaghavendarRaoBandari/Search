SHIFTED DOMINO TABLEAUX

ZAKARIA CHEMLI

Abstract. We introduce new combinatorial objects called the shifted domino tableaux.
We prove that these objects are in bijection with pairs of shifted Young tableaux. This
bijection shows that shifted domino tableaux can be seen as elements of the super shifted
plactic monoid, which is the shifted analog of the super plactic monoid. We also show that
the sum over all shifted domino tableaux of a ﬁxed shape describe a product of two Q-Schur
functions, and by taking a diﬀerent kind of shifted domino tableaux we describe a product
of two P-Schur functions.

1. Introduction

Since their introduction by Young [13] more than a century ago, Young tableaux have been
ubiquitous combinatorial objects, that make important appearances in geometry, algebra
and representation theory. They are used in the study of Schur functions that encode the
characters of the irreductible representations of symmetric groups: indeed, a Schur function
is the sum over all Young tableaux of a given shape of a monomial easily computed from a
tableau. In 1961, Schensted [5] developed an algorithm to compute the maximum length of
a nondecreasing subword of a given word. The output of this algorithm is a Young tableau.
Ten years later, Knuth [3] deﬁned relations that identify the words leading to the same
Young tableau by the algorithm of Schensted. The words giving the same Young tableau
by this algorithm form a plactic class. Thanks to Knuth, Lascoux and Sch¨utzenberger
observed in [8] that the plactic class of the concatenation of two words only depend on
their own plactic classes. In other words, the set of all plactic classes, equivalently the set
of all Young tableaux has a monoid structure, called the plactic monoid, which is of great
importance for applications in representation theory and the theory of symmetric functions.
The ﬁrst signiﬁcant application of the plactic monoid was to provide a complete proof of the
Littlewood-Richardson rule [7], a combinatorial algorithm for multiplying Schur functions,
which had been used for almost 50 years before being fully understood.

By extending Young tableaux to shifted Young tableaux, Sagan [9] and Worley [12] devel-
oped independently a combinatorial theory of shifted Young tableaux parallel to the theory
of Young tableaux. The shifted Young tableaux allow to deﬁne the P-Schur and the Q-Schur
functions. These functions encode the characters of irreductible projective representations
of symmetric groups. A ﬁrst version of a combinatorial algorithm for multiplying Q-Schur
or P-Schur functions (the shifted analog of the Littlewood-Richardson rule) was given by
Stembridge in [10]. A few years ago, Serrano [6] introduced the shifted plactic monoid, a
shifted analog of the plactic monoid with similar properties, and used the shifted plactic
monoid to give a new proof and a new version of the shifted Littlewood-Richardson rule.

The domino tableaux are another extension of Young tableaux. Carr´e and Leclerc in [1]
studied a bijection due to Stanton and White [11] between domino tableaux and pairs of
Young tableaux. The authors gave an easier description of this bijection that highlights the

role of the diagonals of tableaux. This method is equivalent to the approach of Fomin and
Stanton [2]. This allows them to extend the plactic monoid of Lascoux and Sch¨utzenberger
to dominoes, hence, deﬁne the super plactic monoid. They show that each class of the super
plactic monoid is represented by a unique domino tableau, and propose a new combinatorial
description of the product of two Schur functions using domino tableaux, which gives a new
expression of the Littlewood-Richardson rule coeﬃcients in terms of domino tableaux.

In this paper, we extend shifted Young tableaux to new combinatorial objects: The shifted
domino tableaux, these objects can be seen as a shifted analog of domino tableaux or as an
extension of shifted Young tableaux (see Figure 1). The purpose of this extension is to
develop a theory of shifted domino tableaux parallel to the theory of domino tableaux and
shed lights on the combinatorial properties of Q-Schur and P-Schur functions. The paper
is structured as follows. In Section 2, we give some basic deﬁnitions and a brief overview
of Young tableaux [8], shifted Young tableaux [6], the 2-core and 2-quotient of a partition
[4] and domino tableaux [1]. In Section 3, we deﬁne the shifted domino tableaux and prove
that the set of shifted domino tableaux is in bijection with the set of pairs of shifted Young
tableaux. Our proof is inspired from the one of Carr´e and Leclerc [1] regarding the bijection
between the set of domino tableaux and the set of pairs of Young tableaux. Finally, in
Section 4, we extend the shifted plactic monoid [6] to dominoes and deﬁne the super shifted
plactic monoid which is isomorphic to the direct product of two shifted plactic monoids,
and prove that each class of the super shifted plactic monoid is represented by a shifted
domino tableau. We also prove that the sum over all shifted domino tableaux of a ﬁxed
shape describe a product of two Q-Schur functions, and by taking a diﬀerent kind of shifted
domino tableaux we describe a product of two P-Schur functions.

2. Background

2.1. Partitions. A partition λ of an integer n is a ﬁnite non-increasing sequence of positive
integers (λ1, λ2, . . . , λℓ) where the sum, denoted by |λ|, is n. The value λi is the ith part of
λ and the length of λ is its number of parts. A partition λ = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λℓ) is said to be a
strict partition if its parts are strictly decreasing.

The Young diagram of a partition λ is a graphical representation of λ as an array of square
cells, in which the ith row contains λi cells. By embedding naturally a diagram in R2, we
deﬁne the diagonals Dk of a diagram as the straight lines of equation y = x + k, where k is

SHIFTED DOMINO TABLEAUX

an integer, as shown in Figure 2. In a Young diagram, each cell is cut by a unique diagonal
Dk. The diagonal D0 separates the Young diagram into two parts. The part up(λ) contains
the cells that are cut by Dk for any positive integer k, while the remaining cells deﬁne the
part down(λ). In Figure 2, we illustrate the Young diagram of (4, 4, 4, 2, 1) cut by diagonals
Dk, where the shaded part is up((4, 4, 4, 2, 1)) and the white part is down((4, 4, 4, 2, 1)).

Figure 2. The Young diagram of the partition (4, 4, 4, 2, 1) cut by the diag-
onals Dk.

Given a strict partition λ, the shifted Young diagram of λ is the Young diagram of λ in
which the ith row is shifted by i − 1 units to the right with respect to the bottom row. For
example, the shifted Young diagram of (6, 4, 3, 1) is:

.

Let C be a collection of labelled square cells embedded in R2. Each cell of C is cut by
a unique diagonal Dk (see Figure 3). The reading word of C is the sequence of integers
obtained by reading its rows from left to right, starting from the top row and moving down.
Its diagonal reading is the sequence of integers read from bottom to top on each diagonal Dk,
ordered from the leftmost to the rightmost diagonal and separated by ”/”. The evaluation
of C is the tuple (a1, a2, . . . ), where ai is the number of occurence of the letters i in C. For
example, the reading word of the collection of labeled square cells on Figure 3 is 12324316,
its diagonal reading is 1/32/32/1/6/4 and its evaluation is (2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1).

We use the notations of [4] for symmetric functions. Monomial functions, Schur functions,

P-Schur functions and Q-Schur functions are denoted respectively by mλ, sλ, Pλ, and Qλ.

2.2. Young tableaux and shifted Young tableaux. A Young tableau is a ﬁlling of a
Young diagram with positive integers such that the entries are non-decreasing from left to
right along the rows and are increasing from bottom to top along the columns (see Figure 4).
The shape of a Young tableau t denoted by sh(t) is the non-increasing sequence of the lengths
of its rows (i.e., the partition associated with the Young diagram obtained by removing the
labels of the Young tableau).

Let A be a totally ordered inﬁnite alphabet. The plactic monoid, denoted by Pl(A), is the

quotient of the free monoid A∗ by the congruence ≡ generated by the Knuth relations:

(1)

acb ≡ cab with
bac ≡ bca with

a ≤ b < c,
a < b ≤ c.

Each plactic class has a canonical representative which corresponds to the reading word of a
Young tableau. Hence, each plactic class is represented by a unique Young tableau [8]. For
example, the Young tableau on Figure 4 represents the plactic class of the word 542231112.
Given a Young tableau t with evaluation (a1, a2, . . . ), we denote the corresponding mono-

mial by

A Shifted Young Tableau (ShYT) (see Figure 5) is a ﬁlling of a shifted Young diagram by

letters of the totally ordered inﬁnite alphabet {1′ < 1 < 2′ < 2 < · · · } such that

- rows and columns are non-decreasing from left to right and from bottom to top;

(4)

- an element of {1, 2, 3, . . . } appears at most once in each column;
- an element of {1′, 2′, 3′, . . . } appears at most once in each row.

The shape of a ShYT t, denoted by sh(t), is the partition associated with the shifted Young
diagram obtained by removing the labels of t.

Given a Young tableau t of shape λ, we deﬁne t\up(λ) as the shifted Young tableau
obtained by removing the cells of the part up(λ) from t. Two Young tableaux t1 and t2 are
∼=-equivalent if and only if t1 and t2 have same shape and t1\up(λ) is equal to t2\up(λ). For
example, the following two Young tableaux t1 and t2 are ∼=-equivalent:

.

We will use this deﬁnition later in Section 3.
Given a totally ordered inﬁnite alphabet A, the shifted plactic monoid, denoted by ShPl(A),

is the quotient of A∗ by the congruence ∼ generated by the following relations:

(5)

abdc ∼ adbc with
acdb ∼ acbd with

a ≤ b < c < d,
a < b ≤ c < d,
a < b < c ≤ d,
a < b ≤ c < d,
a < b ≤ c ≤ d,
a ≤ b < c ≤ d.

In [6], the author deﬁnes the mixed reading word of a certain shifted tableau as the
canonical representative of the corresponding class of the shifted plactic monoid. Hence,
each class of the shifted plactic monoid is represented by a unique ShYT.

Let λ be a partition of length ℓ satisfying λℓ ≥ ℓ. We can also deﬁne the ShYT as the
ﬁlling of the part up(λ) by X and the part down(λ) by letters in {1′ < 1 < 2′ < 2 < · · · },
so that conditions (4) are satisﬁed. For example, the following ShYT of shape (7, 5, 5, 4) is
equivalent to the ShYT on Figure 5:

For each partition λ, the Q-Schur function is deﬁned as

The P-Schur function is deﬁned as the Q-Schur function with a diﬀerent kind of shifted
Young tableaux, namely those in which the letters on D0 are not allowed to be in {1′, 2′, 3′, . . . }.

2.3. 2-core and 2-quotient of a partition. The 2-core of a partition λ is the partition
obtained from the Young diagram of λ by removing dominoes (i.e., rectangles 1 × 2 or 2 × 1)
having no cells above and on their right side, until no such dominoes exist. The remaining
diagram is the Young diagram of the 2-core of λ. As shown in [4], this process does not
depend on the order in which the dominoes are removed. For example, let us illustrate the
process with (5, 4, 3, 1, 1)

→

→

→

→

,

so that, the 2-core of (5, 4, 3, 1, 1) is (3, 2, 1).

Given a partition λ of length ℓ, the 2-quotient of λ is a pair of partitions (µ, ν) obtained

by the following process:

• deﬁne L as the k-tuple whose ith element is λi + ℓ − i;
• deﬁne M as the k-tuple obtained from L by replacing the even numbers from right

to left successively by 0, 2, 4, . . . , and the odd numbers by 1, 3, 5, . . . ;

• subtract from the even parts of L the corresponding parts from M and divide by 2 to
obtain µ. The partition ν is obtained by the same procedure while considering odd
parts.

Let us illustrate the process on the partition λ = (14, 10, 8, 4, 4, 2, 1, 1):

• the 8-tuple L is (21, 16, 13, 8, 7, 4, 2, 1);
• the 8-tuple M is (7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 0, 1);
• the two partitions µ and ν are:

– µ = 1
– ν = 1

2((16, 8, 4, 2) − (6, 4, 2, 0)) = (5, 2, 1, 1),
2((21, 13, 7, 1) − (7, 5, 3, 1)) = (7, 4, 2).

Hence, the 2-quotient of (14, 10, 8, 4, 4, 2, 1, 1) is ((5, 2, 1, 1), (7, 4, 2)).

2.4. Domino tableaux. By deﬁnition, if the 2-core of a partition λ is the empty partition,
then we can pave λ with dominoes. Such partition is called pavable.

Given a pavable partition λ, a domino tableau of shape λ is a paving of λ by dominoes,
where the dominoes are ﬁlled with positive integers, such that the entries are non-decreasing
along rows from left to right and are increasing along columns from bottom to top.

As for Young tableaux, each domino of a domino tableau is cut by a unique diagonal
D2k. The diagonal D0 separates a domino tableau of shape λ into two parts. The part

SHIFTED DOMINO TABLEAUX

7

up′(λ) contains the dominoes cut by D2k, for a positive integer k, while the remaining domi-
noes form the part down′(λ). In Figure 6, we show a domino tableau of shape (8, 5, 5, 4, 4)
cut by the diagonals D2k, where the shaded part is up′((8, 5, 5, 4, 4)) and the white part is
down′((8, 5, 5, 4, 4)).

The diagonal reading of a domino tableau is the sequence of integers read from bottom to
top on each diagonal D2k, ordered from the leftmost to the rightmost diagonal and separated
by ”/”. The column reading of a domino tableau T is the sequence of integers obtained by
reading the successive columns of T from top to bottom and from left to right. Horizontal
dominoes, which belong to two successive columns i and i + 1, are read only once, when
reading column i. For example, the diagonal reading of the domino tableau in Figure 6 is
5/336/1144/235/2/3 and its column reading is 5313164324523.

Given two tableaux t1 and t2 of respective shapes µ and ν, we say in the sequel that the

pair (t1, t2) has the shape (µ, ν).
Theorem 2.1. Given a pavable partition λ of 2-quotient (µ, ν), the set of domino tableaux
of shape λ and the set of pairs (t1, t2) of Young tableaux of shape (µ, ν) are in bijection.

In [1], the authors prove Theorem 2.1 using an algorithm denoted by Γ in the following,
that sends a domino tableau T of shape λ to a pair of Young tableaux (t1, t2) of shape (µ, ν),
the 2-quotient of λ. Let us recall that Γ consists in deleting on each diagonal of T all labels
on dominoes of type 1 (resp. type 2), the diagonal reading of the remaining labels being
then the diagonal reading of a Young tableau t1 (resp. t2). For example, let us illustrate
algorithm Γ applied to the following domino tableau T :

We obtain a pair of Young tableaux (t1, t2) of shape ((2, 2), (4, 3, 3)). The reverse algorithm
of Γ associates with a pair of Young tableaux (t1, t2) of shape (µ, ν) a domino tableau T of
shape λ. This algorithm starts with the pair (t(0)
2 ) of Young tableaux of shape (µ(0), ν(0)),
which corresponds to the domino tableau T (0) of shape λ(0), where µ(0), ν(0) and λ(0) are empty
partitions. Let us explain the ith-step of this algorithm:
) be a pair of Young
tableaux of shape (µ(i1), ν(i2)), which corresponds to the domino tableau T (i) of shape λ(i),
where i, i1 and i2 are integers. Let u be the smallest integer in (t1, t2) that has not yet
been selected. The algorithm consists in gluing all the cells of (t1, t2) containing the integer
u to (t(i1)
), by keeping the same placement of cells. This operation gives a new pair
(t(i1+1)
) of Young tableaux of shape (µ(i1+1), ν(i2+1)). To build the domino tableau
T (i+1) of shape λ(i+1), for all cells on Dk containing u in t(i1+1)
) we glue a
domino of type 1 (resp. type 2) to the domino tableau T (i) on the corresponding diagonal
D2k, such that −max(µ(i1+1)
) ≤ k ≤ max(ℓµ(i1 +1), ℓν(i2+1)), where ℓµ(i1+1) and ℓν(i2+1)
are respectively the lengths of µ(i1+1) and ν(i2+1). For example the reverse algorithm applied
to (t1, t2) gives:

3. Shifted domino tableaux

A pavable partition λ of 2-quotient (µ, ν) is a Shifted pavable partition (ShPP) if and only

if it satisﬁes both conditions:

• The last parts of µ and ν are greater than or equal to their lengths;
• There is no vertical domino d on D0, such that d has at its left only adjacent dominoes

strictly above D0.

For example, the paved partition on the right is not a ShPP, but the one on the left is.

Given a ShPP λ, a Shifted Domino Tableau (ShDT) is a ﬁlling of the dominoes of the part
up′(λ) of λ by X and those of the part down′(λ) by letters in {1′ < 1 < 2′ < 2 < · · · } such
that

- rows and columns are non-decreasing from left to right and from bottom to top;

(11)

- an element of {1, 2, 3, . . . } appears at most once in each column;
- an element of {1′, 2′, 3′, . . . } appears at most once in each row.

The column reading and the diagonal reading of a shifted domino tableau T are deﬁned

removing the dominoes of the part up′(λ) from T . Two domino tableaux T1 and T2 are ∼=′-
equivalent if and only if T1 and T2 have the same shape λ and T1\up′(λ) is equal to T2\up′(λ).

Theorem 3.1. Let λ be a ShPP of 2-quotient (µ, ν). The set of ShDT of shape λ and the
set of pairs (t1, t2) of ShYT of shape (µ, ν) are in bijection.

Let λ be a ShPP of 2-quotient (µ, ν). In order to prove Theorem 3.1, we introduce two
sets E and F : Let E denote the set of labeled ShPP by letters in {1′ < 1 < 2′ < 2 < · · · },

SHIFTED DOMINO TABLEAUX

satisfying the conditions (11). In other words, E is a set of special kind of ShDT, those in
which the dominoes of the part up′(λ) are not labeled by X (all the dominoes are labeled in
the same way as the part down′(λ)). For example, the two domino tableaux below are in E:

Following the same idea, we deﬁne F as the set of pairs of tableaux (t1, t2) of shape (µ, ν)
labeled by letters in {1′ < 1 < 2′ < 2 < · · · }, satisfying the conditions (11) and such that
when the length of µ is greater than or equal to 2, if there is a letter ℓ1 in t1 on D0 and a
letter ℓ2 in the same position in t2, with ℓ1 < ℓ2, then there is a letter ℓ3 at the left of ℓ2
on the same row, satisfying ℓ1 = ℓ3 in the case that ℓ1 is a primed letter and ℓ1 < ℓ3 in the
other cases. For example, the following two pairs of tableaux are in F .


 1 2’

5 6 7
2 2’ 4

 , 

5 6 7
2 4 5’

 1’ 1 1 3

, 2 2 3’ 3

8 


The pair of tableaux represented below is not in F , because in position (3, 3) (the shaded

cells) we have 8′ > 7 but on the left of 8′, there is no letter greater than 7.


 1 3’ 3 4



,

Note that if we replace the labels of the part up′(λ) of an element of E (resp. the labels
of the parts up(µ) and up(ν) of an element of F ) by X, we obtain a ShDT (resp. a pair of
ShYT).

Proof. We prove Theorem 3.1 by using Γ. Even if the labeling conditions of the elements of E
are diﬀerent from the labeling conditions of domino tableaux, Γ associates with each element
T of shape λ in E a unique pair of tableaux (t1, t2) of shape (µ, ν) satisfying conditions (11),
and such that when the length of µ is greater than or equal to 2, if there is a letter ℓ1 in t1
on D0 and a letter ℓ2 in the same position in t2, with ℓ1 < ℓ2, then there is a letter ℓ3 at
the left of ℓ2 on the same row, satisfying ℓ1 = ℓ3 in the case that ℓ1 is a primed letter and
ℓ1 < ℓ3 in the other cases. Indeed, if the length of µ is greater than or equal to 2, and there
is a letter ℓ1 in t1 on D0 and a letter ℓ2 in the same position in t2 such that ℓ1 < ℓ2, and
there is no letter ℓ3 on the left of ℓ2 satisfying ℓ1 = ℓ3 in the case that ℓ1 is a primed letter
and ℓ1 < ℓ3 in the other cases, that means that we must have a vertical domino of type 1
in λ on D0 having only dominoes belonging to up′(λ) on its left, which is impossible since
λ is a ShPP. Hence, this deﬁnes a map from E to F . The reverse algorithm associates with
each pair of tableaux in F a unique element of E, which deﬁnes a reverse map from F to E.
Then the sets E and F are in bijection.

Recall that t1

∼= t2 if and only if t1 and t2 have same shape µ, and t1\up(µ) is equal to
∼=′ T2 if and only if T1 and T2 have same shape λ, and T1\up(λ) is equal
t2\up(µ). And T1
to T2\up(λ). Consider two elements T and T ′ in E which are in the same equivalence class
for the relation ∼=′. Then, we obtain by Γ two pairs of tableaux (t1, t2) and (t′
2) in F such
2. This deﬁnes a map from E/ ∼=′ to F/ ∼=. Conversely, we deﬁne a
that t1
map from F/ ∼= to E/ ∼=′ by considering two pairs of tableaux (t1, t2) and (t′
2) in F which

∼= t′

∼= t′

1 and t2

12

are ∼=-equivalent. The reverse algorithm of Γ gives two elements T and T ′ of E which are
∼=′-equivalent. Hence, the sets E/ ∼=′ and F/ ∼= are in bijection.

The labeling and the relations between elements of the upper parts does not change the
result since we are interested only on the lower parts, then we can label all the dominoes
of the upper parts by X. Therefore, the set of ShDT and set of pairs of ShYT are in
bijection.

In terms of symmetric functions, Theorem 3.1 becomes

Theorem 3.2. Let λ be a ShPP whose 2-quotient is (µ, ν). One has

where the sum runs over all ShDT T of shape λ.

xT = QµQν

XT ;sh(T )=λ

Proof. Let (µ, ν) be the 2-quotient of a ShPP λ. From Theorem 3.1, it follows that the
evaluation of a shifted domino tableau T of shape λ is the sum of the evaluations of its
corresponding pair of shifted Young tableaux (t1, t2) of shapes (µ, ν), thus, one ﬁnds

Let λ and θ be two partitions. Deﬁne K ′(2)

λθ as the number of shifted domino tableaux of
shape λ and evaluation θ. The sum of Equation (12) is a symmetric function in the variables
x1, x2, . . . whose expansion on the basis of monomial functions is given by

Corollary 3.1. Let λ be a partition. Then

where the ﬁrst sum runs over all shifted domino tableaux T of shape λ and the second sum
runs over all partitions θ.

The numbers K ′(2)

λθ are the shifted domino analogues of the Kostka numbers.

Remark 3.1. The same result holds if we consider P-Schur functions rather than Q-Schur
functions, by taking a diﬀerent kind of shifted domino tableaux (those in which the letters on
D0 are not allowed to be marked).

Let A1 := {a1

3 < · · · } be two totally
ordered inﬁnite alphabets. The super shifted plactic monoid, denoted by SShPl(A1, A2) is
the quotient of the free monoid (A1 ∪ A2)∗ generated by the relations

An equivalence class of SShPl(A1, A2) is called a super shifted plactic class (SShPC).

Theorem 4.1. Each SShPC is represented by a unique shifted domino tableau.

Proof. Let w1 and w2 be two words. According to the deﬁnition of SShPl(A1, A2), the words
w1 and w2 are in the same SShPC if w1|A1 ≡ w2|A1 and w1|A2 ≡ w2|A2, where w|A1 (resp. w|A2)
denotes the restriction of a word w to A1 (resp. A2). In other words, two words w1 and w2
are in the same SShPC if w1|A1 and w2|A1 are in the same ShPl class associated to a shifted
Young tableau t1 and also w1|A2 and w2|A2 are in the same ShPl class associated to a shifted
Young tableau t2. Then, we can associate to each SShPC a unique pair of shifted Young
tableaux (t1, t2). Thanks to Theorem 3.1, we conclude that each SShPC is represented by a
unique ShDT.

We know that if two words are shifted plactic equivalent, then they are plactic equivalent.

Consequently, we have the following proposition:

Proposition 4.1. The super shifted plactic equivalence is a reﬁnement of the super plactic
equivalence. Each super plactic class is a disjoint union of super shifted plactic classes. In
other words, if two words are super shifted plactic equivalent, then they are super plactic
equivalent.
