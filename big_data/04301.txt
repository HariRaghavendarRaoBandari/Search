Introduction

Let A be a matrix with order n × n, and ρ(A) be the spectral radius of A. Let G be a simple
connected graph. Let V (G) and E(G) be the vertex set and the edge set of G, respectively.
Its order is |V (G)|, and its size is |E(G)|. For v ∈ V (G), let d(v) be the degree of v, NG(v)
be the set of neighbours of a vertex v in G. We use the notation I for the identity matrix,
e for the vector consisting of all ones, Sn for the star of order n, Cn for the cycle of length
n, Pn for the path of length n − 1 and V ol(G) for the sum of the degrees of all vertices in
G. Meanwhile, we use the notation S(G) to denote the subdivision graph of G, which is the
graph obtained from G by inserting some new vertices to some edges of G.

Let A(G) and D(G) be the adjacency matrix and the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees
of G, respectively. The Laplacian and normalized Laplacian matrices of G are deﬁned as
L(G) = D(G) − A(G) and L(G) = D− 1
2 (G), respectively. When only one graph
G is under consideration, we sometimes use A, D, L and L instead of A(G), D(G), L(G) and
L(G) respectively. It is easy to see that L(G) is a symmertric positive semideﬁnite matrix
and D
2 (G)e is an eigenvector of L(G) with eigenvalue 0. Thus, the eigenvalues λi(G) of L(G)
satisfy

Some of them maybe repeated according to their multiplicities. λk(G) is the k-th smallest
normalized Laplacian eigenvalue of G. Thus ρ(L(G)) = λn(G). When only one graph is under
consideration, we may use λk and ρ(L) instead of λk(G) and ρ(L(G)), respectively.

In terms of λ2(G), Chung [1] showed that λ2(G) is 0 if and only if G is disconnected. This
result is closely related to the second smallest eigenvalue of its Laplacian matrix [2]. H.H. Li
et al. [3, 4] studied the behavior of λ2 when the graph is perturbed by grafting an edge and
a pendent path, respectively. Recently, J.X. Li et al. [5] studied the behavior of λ2 when the
graph is perturbed by separating an edge. They determined all trees and unicyclic graphs
√2
2 . Guo et al. [7] studied the behavior of ρ(L) when the graph is perturbed
with λ2(G) ≥ 1 −
by removing pendant edges from one vertex to another. The non-bipartite unicyclic graph
with ﬁxed order and girth which has the largest ρ(L) was also determined.

In this paper, we further study the behaviors of λ2 and ρ(L) when the graph is perturbed

by three operations.

2 Preliminaries

In this section we recall some properties of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the normal-
ized Laplacian matrix of a graph G. Let g be a vector such that g 6= 0. Then we can view g as
a function which assigns to each vertex v of G a real value g(v), the coordinate of g according
to v (All the vectors in this paper are dealt in this way). By letting g = D1/2f , we have

gT Lg
gT g

=

f T D1/2LD1/2f
(D1/2f )T D1/2f

=

f T Lf
f T Df

= Puv∈E(G)(f (u) − f (v))2
Pv∈V (G) d(v)(f (v))2

.

Thus, we can obtain the following formulas for λ2 and ρ(L).

λ2 = inf
f⊥De

f T Lf
f T Df

= inf

ρ(L) = sup

Puv∈E(G)(f (u) − f (v))2

Puv∈E(G)(f (u) − f (v))2
Pv∈V (G) d(v)(f (v))2

.

A nonzero vector that satisﬁes equality in (1) or (2) is called a harmonic eigenfunction

associated with λ2(G) or ρ(L(G)).

Lemma 2.1 [1] Let G be a simple connected graph and f be a harmonic eigenfunction

associated with λ2(G). Then for any v ∈ V (G), we have

1
d(v) X
uv∈E(G)

(f (v) − f (u)) = λ2(G)f (v).

From Lemma 2.1, we have the following result.
Corollary 2.2 Let G be a simple connected graph and f be a harmonic eigenfunction

associated with λ2(G). If λ2(G) = 1, then for any v ∈ V (G), we have

X

f (u) = 0.

uv∈E(G)

If f is a harmonic eigenfunction associated with ρ(L(G)), the similar results about Lemma

2.1 and Corollary 2.2 are obtained.

From Corollary 2.2, we have the following result.
Corollary 2.3 Let v be the center of the star Sn, f is a harmonic eigenfunction associated

with λ2(Sn). Then f (v) = 0.

Proof Through a simple calculation, we can obtain λ2(Sn) = 1. Combining the Corollary

2.2, the result is clear. (cid:3)

Lemma 2.4 [1] For a graph which is not a complete graph, we have λ2 ≤ 1.
Next we will deﬁne three operations:
Operation I. G′ is obtained by inserting a new vertex w to an edge uv of G. That is to

say G′ = G − uv + uw + wv.

Operation II. Let G1 and G2 be two simple connected graphs, u ∈ V (G1), v ∈ V (G2).

Let G be a graph obtained from G1 and G2 by identifying u with v (see Figure 1).

Operation III. Let u, v be two vertices of the simple connected graph G. Suppose that
v1, v2, . . . , vs (1 ≤ s ≤ d(v)) are some vertices of NG(v)\NG(u) and v1, v2, . . . , vs are diﬀerent
from u. Let G′ be the graph obtained from G by deleting the edges vvi and adding the edges
uvi. That is to say G′ = G − vv1 − vv2 − · · · − vvs + uv1 + uv2 + · · · + uvs.

3 The eﬀects on the λ2(G) of a graph by three operations

In this section we study the behavior of λ2 when the graph is perturbed by three operations.
The following theorem studies the behavior of λ2 when the graph is perturbed by Opera-

tion I.

Theorem 3.1 Let G be a simple connected graph of order n, uv ∈ E(G) and G′ =
G − uv + uw + wv. Then λ2(G) ≥ λ2(G′), and the inequality is strict if f (u)f (v) 6= 0, where
f is a harmonic eigenfunction associated with λ2(G).

Proof Let V (G) = {u, v, u1, u2, . . . , un−2} and V (G′) = {u, v, u1, u2, . . . , un−2, w}. Let
d(x) and d′(x) be the degrees of x in G and G′, respectively. Let D and D′ be the diagonal
degree matrices of G and G′, respectively. Let L and L′ be the Laplacian matrices of G
and G′, respectively. Let e and e′ be the vectors consisting of all ones, where e ∈ Rn and
e′ ∈ Rn+1. Then d′(w) = 2 ,d′(x) = d(x), x ∈ V (G). Since f is a harmonic eigenfunction
associated with λ2(G). Then f 6= 0 and f ⊥ De. Let us distinguish two cases.

Case 1 f (u)f (v) ≤ 0. Let h be a vector such that h(w) = 0, h(x) = f (x), where

x ∈ V (G). Then

hT D′e′ = X

x∈V (G′)

h(x)d′(x) = X
x∈V (G)

h(x)d′(x) + h(w)d′(w)

f (x)d(x) = f T De = 0.

= X
x∈V (G)

Thus h ⊥ D′e′. Note that h 6= 0. Then, we have

hT L′h
hT D′h

≥ λ2(G′).

Moreover

hT D′h = X

x∈V (G′)

x∈V (G)

d′(x)h2(x) = X
x∈V (G)
d(x)f 2(x) = f T Df,

d′(x)h2(x) + d′(w)h2(w)

and

hT L′h = X

(h(x) − h(y))2

≤ f T Lf.

Thus, from Formula (1), we have

λ2(G) =

f T Lf
f T Df

≥

hT L′h
hT D′h

≥ λ2(G′).

If f (u)f (v) < 0, then f T Lf > hT L′h. Thus, λ2(G) > λ2(G′).

Case 2 f (u)f (v) > 0. Let h be a vector such that h(w) = f (u), h(x) = f (x), where

x ∈ V (G). Then

hT L′h = X

(h(x) − h(y))2

xy∈E(G′)

=

X

(h(x) − h(y))2 + (h(u) − h(w))2 + (h(w) − h(v))2

Let p = h + ce′, where c = − 2f (u)

V ol(G)+2 . Then

pT D′e′ = (h + ce′)T D′e′ = hT D′e′ + ce′T D′e′ = 2f (u) + c(V ol(G) + 2) = 0.

Thus p ⊥ D′e′. Note that p 6= 0. Then, we have

pT L′p
pT D′p

≥ λ2(G′).

pT L′p = hT L′h = f T Lf,

It is clear that

Thus, from Formula (1), we have

λ2(G) =

f T Lf
f T Df

pT L′p
pT D′p

≥ λ2(G′).

Combining Cases 1 and 2, the result follows. (cid:3)

From Theorem 3.1, we have the following result.
Corollary 3.2 Let G be a simple connected graph and S(G) be the subdivision graph of

G. Then λ2(G) ≥ λ2(S(G)).

The following theorem studies the behavior of λ2 when the graph is perturbed by Opera-

tion II.

Theorem 3.3 Let G1 and G2 be two simple connected graphs of orders m and n, re-
spectively. Let u ∈ V (G1) and v ∈ V (G2). Let G be a graph obtained from G1 and G2 by
identifying u with v. Then λ2(G) ≤ λ2(G1), and the inequality is strict if f1(u) 6= 0, where
f1 is a harmonic eigenfunction associated with λ2(G1).

Proof Let V (G1) = {x1, x2, . . . , xm−1, u}, V (G2) = {y1, y2, . . . , yn−1, v}, and V (G) =
{x1, x2, . . . , xm−1, u, y1, y2, . . . , yn−1}. Let d(x), d1(x) and d2(x) be the degree of x in G, the

5

degree of x in G1, and the degree of x in G2, respectively. Let D and D1 be the diagonal
degree matrices of G and G1, respectively. Let L and L1 be the Laplacian matrices of G and
G1, respectively. Let e and e1 be the vectors consisting of all ones, where e ∈ Rm+n−1 and
e1 ∈ Rm. Then d(xi) = d1(xi), i = 1, 2, · · · , m − 1, d(yj) = d2(yj), j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, and
d(u) = d1(u) + d2(v). Since f1 is a harmonic eigenfunction associated with λ2(G1). Then
f1 6= 0 and f1 ⊥ D1e1.

Let f (x) = f1(x), ∀x ∈ V (G1), f (yj) = f1(u), j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. Then we have

Thus h ⊥ De. Note that h 6= 0. Then, we have

If f1(u) 6= 0, then hT Dh > f T

From Theorem 3.3, the following is easily obtained.
Corollary 3.4 Let G1 and G2 be two simple connected graphs, u ∈ V (G1), v ∈ V (G2). Let

G be a graph obtained from G1 and G2 by identifying u with v. Then λ2(G) ≤ min{λ2(G1), λ2(G2)}.

In particular, if T is a tree, then it is clear that T can be obtained from the subtree T1

and T2 by Operation II. Hence, by Corollary 3.4, the following is immediate.

Corollary 3.5 [6] Let T be a tree. If T ′ is a subtree of T , then λ2(T ) ≤ λ2(T ′).
The following theorem studies the behavior of λ2 when the graph is perturbed by Opera-

tion III.

Theorem 3.6 Let u, v be two vertices of the simple connected graph G of order n. Suppose
that v1, v2, . . . , vs(1 ≤ s ≤ d(v)) are some vertices of NG(v)\NG(u) and v1, v2, . . . , vs are
diﬀerent from u. Let G′ = G − vv1 − vv2 − · · · − vvs + uv1 + uv2 + · · · + uvs and f be a
harmonic eigenfunction associated with λ2(G). If f (u) = f (v), Then λ2(G) ≥ λ2(G′).

Proof Let d(x) and d′(x) be the degree of x in G and the degree of x in G′, respectively.
Let D and D′ be the diagonal degree matrices of G and G′, respectively. Let L and L′ be the
Laplacian matrices of G and G′, respectively. Let e be the vector consisting of all ones, where

7

e ∈ R|G|. Then d′(v) = d(v) − s ,d′(u) = d(u) + s, d′(x) = d(x), where x ∈ V (G)\{u, v}.
Since f is a harmonic eigenfunction associated with λ2(G). Then f 6= 0 and f ⊥ De. Let
f′(u) = f (u), ∀u ∈ V (G). Then f′(u) = f (u) = f (v) = f′(v),

Figure 2: Graph Ga and Gb

Figure 2 shows that the conditoin f (u) = f (v) of Theorem 3.6 is necessary. If f (u) 6= f (v),
then the relation between values of λ2(G) and λ2(G′) is not sure. There are the following
three cases. For Ga and Gb in Figure 2 (Gb is G3 of Theorem 2.4 in [4]), the natural num-
bers represent the vertices and the real numbers attached to vertices in each graphs are the
valuations by the harmonic eigenfuction associated with λ2(G).

Case 1 λ2(G) < λ2(G′). Let G = Ga and 4, 3, 5 stand for u, v, v1, respectively.

It
is clear that f (u) > f (v). Denote G′ = G − vv1 + uv1. By direct calculation, we obtain
λ2(G) = 0.1408 < 0.1557 = λ2(G′).

Case 2 λ2(G) = λ2(G′). Let G = Ga and 1, 3, 5 stand for u, v, v1, respectively. It is
clear that f (u) > f (v). Denote G′ = G − vv1 + uv1. Because G is isomorphic to G′, we obtain
λ2(G) = λ2(G′) = 0.1408.

Case 3 λ2(G) > λ2(G′). Let G = Gb and 1, 2, 8 stand for u, v, v1, respectively.

It
is clear that f (u) > f (v). Denote G′ = G − vv1 + uv1. By direct calculation, we obtain
λ2(G) = 0.2290 > 0.2105 = λ2(G′).

From above, we can see that if f (u) > f (v), the relation between values of λ2(G) and
λ2(G′) is not sure. Note that if f is a harmonic eigenfunction associated with λ2(G), −f is
also a harmonic eigenfunction associated with λ2(G). When f (u) < f (v), the similar result
is obtained.

4 The eﬀects on the ρ(L(G)) of a graph by three operations

In this section we study the behavior of ρ(L) when the graph is perturbed by three operations.
The following theorem studies the behavior of ρ(L) when the graph is perturbed by Op-

eration I.

Theorem 4.1 Let G be a simple connected graph of order n, uv ∈ E(G) and G′ =
G−uv+uw+wv. Let f be a harmonic eigenfunction associated with ρ(L(G)). If f (u)f (v) ≥ 0
Then ρ(L(G)) ≤ ρ(L(G′)), and the inequality is strict if f (u)f (v) > 0.

Proof Let V (G) = {u, v, u1, u2, . . . , un−2} and V (G′) = {u, v, u1, u2, . . . , un−2, w}. Let
d(x) and d′(x) be the degrees of x in G and G′, respectively. Let D and D′ be the diagonal
degree matrices of G and G′, respectively. Let L and L′ be the Laplacian matrices of G
and G′, respectively. Let e and e′ be the vectors consisting of all ones, where e ∈ Rn and
e′ ∈ Rn+1. Then d′(w) = 2 ,d′(x) = d(x), x ∈ V (G). Since f is a harmonic eigenfunction
associated with ρ(L(G)). Then f 6= 0 and f ⊥ De.

Let h be a vector such that h(w) = 0, h(x) = f (x), where x ∈ V (G). Then

hT D′e′ = X

h(x)d′(x)

Thus h ⊥ D′e′. Note that h 6= 0. Then, we have

If f (u)f (v) > 0, then f T Lf < hT L′h. Thus, ρ(L(G)) < ρ(L(G′)). (cid:3)

It is clear that the proof of Theorem 4.1 is similar to the proof of Case 1 in Theorem 3.1.
Figure 3 shows that the conditoin f (u)f (v) ≥ 0 of Theorem 4.1 is necessary. If f (u)f (v) <
0, then the relation between values of ρ(L(G)) and ρ(L(G′)) is not sure. There are the
following two cases. For Gc and Gd in Figure 3, the real numbers attached to vertices in each
graphs are the valuations by the harmonic eigenfuction associated with ρ(L(G)).

Case 1 ρ(L(G)) < ρ(L(G′)). Let G = Gc and 5, 6 stand for u, v, respectively.

It is
clear that f (u)f (v) < 0. Denote G′ = G − uv + uw + wv. By direct calculation, we obtain
ρ(L(G)) = 1.8993 < 1.9382 = ρ(L(G′)).

Case 2 ρ(L(G)) ≥ ρ(L(G′)). Let G = Gd and 1, 2 stand for u, v, respectively.

It is
clear that f (u)f (v) < 0. Denote G′ = G − uv + uw + wv. By direct calculation, we obtain
ρ(L(G)) = ρ(L(C4)) = 2 > 1 − cos 4

5 π = ρ(L(C5)) = ρ(L(G′)).

The following theorem studies the behavior of ρ(L) when the graph is perturbed by Op-

eration II.

Theorem 4.2 Let G1 and G2 be two simple connected graphs of orders m and n, re-
spectively. Let u ∈ V (G1) and v ∈ V (G2). Let G be a graph obtained from G1 and G2
by identifying u with v. Let f1 be a harmonic eigenfunction associated with ρ(L(G1)). If
f1(u) = 0, then ρ(L(G)) ≥ ρ(L(G1)).

Proof Let V (G1) = {x1, x2, . . . , xm−1, u}, V (G2) = {y1, y2, . . . , yn−1, v}, and V (G) =
{x1, x2, . . . , xm−1, u, y1, y2, . . . , yn−1}. Let d(x), d1(x) and d2(x) be the degree of x in G, the
degree of x in G1, and the degree of x in G2, respectively. Let D and D1 be the diagonal
degree matrices of G and G1, respectively. Let L and L1 be the Laplacian matrices of G and
G1, respectively. Let e and e1 be the vectors consisting of all ones, where e ∈ Rm+n−1 and
e1 ∈ Rm. Then d(xi) = d1(xi), i = 1, 2, · · · , m − 1, d(yj) = d2(yj), j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, and
d(u) = d1(u) + d2(v). Since f1 is a harmonic eigenfunction associated with ρ(L(G1)). Then
f1 6= 0 and f1 ⊥ D1e1.

Thus f ⊥ De. Note that f 6= 0. Then, we have

The result follows.(cid:3)

It is clear that the proof of Theorem 4.2 is similar to the proof of Theorem 3.3.

Figure 3 shows that the conditoin f1(u) = 0 of Theorem 4.2 is necessary. If f1(u) 6= 0,
then the relation between values of ρ(L(G1)) and ρ(L(G)) is not sure. There are the following
two cases.

Case 1 ρ(L(G1)) < ρ(L(G)). Let G1 = Gc, 7 stand for u and G2 = P2. It is clear that
f1(u) 6= 0. G is obtained from G1 and G2 by Operation II. By direct calculation, we obtain
ρ(L(G1)) = 1.8993 < 1.9382 = ρ(L(G)).

Case 2 ρ(L(G1)) ≥ ρ(L(G)). Let G1 = Gd = C4, 4 stand for u and G2 = C3. It is clear
that f1(u) 6= 0. G is obtained from G1 and G2 by Operation II. By direct calculation, we
obtain ρ(L(G1)) = ρ(L(C4)) = 2 > 1.9010 = ρ(L(G)).

The following theorem studies the behavior of ρ(L) when the graph is perturbed by Op-

eration III.

Theorem 4.3 Let u, v be two vertices of the simple connected graph G of order n. Suppose
that v1, v2, . . . , vs (1 ≤ s ≤ d(v)) are some vertices of NG(v)\NG(u) and v1, v2, . . . , vs are
diﬀerent from u. Let G′ = G − vv1 − vv2 − · · · − vvs + uv1 + uv2 + · · · + uvs, and f be a
harmonic eigenfunction associated with ρ(L(G)). If f (u) = f (v), then ρ(L(G)) ≤ ρ(L(G′)).
Proof Let d(x) and d′(x) be the degree of x in G and the degree of x in G′, respectively.
Let D and D′ be the diagonal degree matrices of G and G′, respectively. Let L and L′ be the
Laplacian matrices of G and G′, respectively. Let e be the vector consisting of all ones, where
e ∈ R|G|. Then d′(v) = d(v) − s ,d′(u) = d(u) + s, d′(x) = d(x), where x ∈ V (G)\{u, v}.
Since f is a harmonic eigenfunction associated with ρ(L(G)). Then f 6= 0 and f ⊥ De. Let
f′(u) = f (u), ∀u ∈ V (G). Then f′(u) = f (u) = f (v) = f′(v).

Similar to the proof of Theorem 3.6, we have

f′T L′f′ = f T Lf, f′T D′f′ = f T Df, f′T D′e = f T De = 0.

Thus f′⊥D′e. Note that f′ 6= 0. Then we have

f′T L′f′
f′T D′f′

≤ ρ(L(G′)).

Thus, from Formula (2), we have

ρ(L(G)) =

f T Lf
f T Df

=

f′T L′f′
f′T D′f′

≤ ρ(L(G′).

The result follows.(cid:3)
Figure 3 shows that the conditoin f (u) = f (v) of Theorem 4.3 is necessary. If f (u) 6= f (v),
then the relation between values of ρ(L(G)) and ρ(L(G′)) is not sure. There are the following
three cases.

Case 1 ρ(L(G)) < ρ(L(G′)). Let G = Gc and 4, 3, 5 stand for u, v, v1, respectively.
It is clear that f (u) > f (v). Denote G′ = G − vv1 + uv1. By direct calculation, we obtain
ρ(L(G)) = 1.8993 < 1.9063 = ρ(L(G′)).

Case 2 ρ(L(G)) = ρ(L(G′)). Let G = Gc and 1, 3, 5 stand for u, v, v1, respectively. It
is clear that f (u) > f (v). Denote G′ = G − vv1 + uv1. Because G is isomorphic to G′, we
obtain ρ(L(G)) = ρ(L(G′)) = 1.8993.

Case 3 ρ(L(G)) > ρ(L(G′)). Let G = Gc and 2, 5, 6 stand for u, v, v1, respectively.
Considering g = −f as the harmonic eigenfuction associated with ρ(L(G)). It is clear that
g(u) = −0.0214 > −0.3250 = g(v). Denote G′ = G − vv1 + uv1. By direct calculation, we
obtain ρ(L(G)) = 1.8993 > 1.8243 = ρ(L(G′)).

13

From the above, we can see that if f (u) > f (v), then the relation between values of
ρ(L(G)) and ρ(L(G′)) is not sure. Note that if f is a harmonic eigenfunction associated
with ρ(L(G)), then −f is also a harmonic eigenfunction associated with ρ(L(G)). When
f (u) < f (v), the similar result is obtained.
