(Dated: March 15, 2016)

Extensive all-atom molecular dynamics calculations on the water-squalane interface for nine dif-
ferent loadings with sorbitan monooleate (SPAN80), at T = 300K, are analyzed for the surface
tension equation of state, desorption free energy proﬁles as they depend on loading, and to evaluate
escape times for absorbed SPAN80 into the bulk phases. These results suggest that loading only
weakly aﬀects accommodation of a SPAN80 molecule by this squalane-water interface. Speciﬁcally,
the surface tension equation of state is simple through the range of high tension to high loading
studied, and the desorption free energy proﬁles are weakly dependent on loading here. The per-
pendicular motion of the centroid of the SPAN80 head-group ring is well-described by a diﬀusional
model near the minimum of the desorption free energy proﬁle. Lateral diﬀusional motion is weakly
dependent on loading. Escape times evaluated on the basis of a diﬀusional model and the desorption
free energies are 7 × 10−2 s (into the squalane) and 3 × 102 h (into the water). The latter value is
consistent with irreversible absorption observed by related experimental work.

INTRODUCTION

COREXIT 9500 is a standard dispersant used in re-
sponse to oil spills [1]. Confronting molecular-scale the-
ory, the formulation of COREXIT 9500 is non-trivial and
has evolved to address issues identiﬁed by decades of ex-
perience [2]. Therefore, this material provides context
for development of theory, in addition to experiment and
simulation, that might provide molecular insight into the
structure and function of oil-water-surfactant systems.

COREXIT 9500

sorbitan monooleate
(SPAN80, FIG. 1), an ethoxylated sorbitan monooleate
(TWEEN80),
the anionic surfactant sodium dioctyl
sulfosuccinate (NaDOS), and alkane solvent (NORPAR
13) [1]. Each of these components, and their proportions,
have been chosen to achieve design characteristics [2]. In
each case, the statistical mechanical theory that would
provide quantitative molecular-scale explanation is un-
available. NaDOS provides one example: the molecular
theory of electrolyte eﬀects on the thermodynamics,
structure and dynamics of aqueous solution interfaces is
a long-standing [3–5] and current research target [6]. As
another example, the speciﬁc structural and dynamical
description of the ethoxylated chains attached to the
TWEEN80 head-group, and the contrast to the SPAN80
case, is not available though this is an area of signiﬁcant
recent interest [7–11].

In building the basic molecular theory, it is natural
to study the eﬀects arising from the several components
separately, and then to study their various interactions.
Here we study the solution interface between water and
a model oil phase, with SPAN80 at a wide range of load-
ings. We follow the experimental work of Reichert and

Walker [12] in adopting squalane as the model oil phase,
though they treated TWEEN80 without SPAN80, and
water with non-zero NaCl electrolyte concentration to
correspond to seawater. We start with SPAN80 alone be-
cause that is simpler, but further complicating features
might be added after this initial step [13].

An intriguing aspect of the experimental work [12] was
the demonstration of irreversible absorption behavior of
TWEEN80 for surface tensions above a critical value near
32 mN/m, i.e., for low surface loadings. That behav-
ior was observed to be independent of the ionic strength
of the aqueous phase. Operational irreversibility might
be traced to rates of desorption, and those rates might
be inﬂuenced by entanglement of the ethoxylated head-
group of the TWEEN80 surfactant. Evaluating desorp-
tion rates for SPAN80 at this interface provides a base-
line result for considering the TWEEN80 case, and those
baseline results are a target of the work which follows
below.

The most important step in determining desorption
rates is to establish the free energy proﬁle for the process.
Here, we obtain free energies of desorption of SPAN80

FIG. 2. System for interface simulations. Here the system
included 75 squalane molecules (middle layer), 1000 water
molecules (top and bottom), and 5 SPAN80 molecules loaded
at each interface. Other cases were composed similarly but
with diﬀerent numbers of SPAN80 molecules loaded at the
interfaces.

These results were produced by standard MD simulation as
described in Sec. IV. nSPAN80 = 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,
50 SPAN80 molecules/interface cases were treated. The sta-
tistical uncertainties indicated are 95% conﬁdence intervals
obtained by a bootstrap technique based on surface tensions
extracted over ∆t = 1 ns segments along 100 ns simulation
for each case.

II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

from the water-squalane interface, stratifying the free en-
ergy changes with a standard windowing approach and
exploiting parallel tempering [14] to investigate sampling
suﬃciency for the individual strata. FIG. 2 shows the
case with 5 SPAN80 molecules absorbed at each interface.
The windowing not only provides the free energy proﬁle
for the desorption but also the net free energy for the
transfer of a SPAN80 molecule from water to squalane.
Methodological speciﬁcs are collected in Sec. IV below,
except where they are pertinent to an isolated facet of the
results. Preceding simulations studied SPAN80 micelles
in the context of drug delivery applications [15].

A distinguishing aspect of our work is that it is that
all-atom models are treated exclusively, in contrast to
coarse-grained models implemented in CHARMM [16],
MARTINI [17] and SDK packages [18]. Important work
on escape times of nonionic surfactants from micelles and
hydrophobic surfaces has featured coarse-grained MD
models [19]. The present work is restricted to planar
interfaces.

Surface tensions were obtained standardly (Sec. IV)
from molecular dynamics simulations for nine surface
loadings (FIG. 3). When the absorption Γ vanishes, the
surface tension (FIG. 3) agrees well with experiment [12],
and the surface tensions decrease with increasing Γ, as
expected. Comparing the standard MD results with par-
allel tempering values (FIG. 4) shows consistent behavior
and remarkable simplicity over our whole range of load-
ings. A maximum loading for SPAN80 naturally should
be higher than the maximum loading for TWEEN80, but
Γ for our strongly loaded case is about a factor of three
(3) higher than the estimated maximum surface coverage
for TWEEN80 [12]. A weakly loaded regime is identiﬁed

for Γ < 0.17/(cid:10)Rg

2(cid:11) , about 10% of our highest loading.

Desorption free energy proﬁles were obtained for the
unloaded case (nSPAN80 = 0/interface) and our strongly
loaded case (nSPAN80 = 50/interface). The free energy
proﬁles (FIGs. 5 and 6) are remarkably similar for the
two cases. The desorption free energy barrier from in-
terface to squalane phase is around 8 kcal/mol and the
free energy barrier is 19.6 kcal/mol from interface to bulk
water.

To analyze the kinetics of the desorption process, we
assume that the motion of the centroid of a SPAN80

with R(t) the random-force exhaustively discussed else-
where [21], then corresponds to Eq. (1). Establishing the

necessary force constant by βκ(cid:10)δz2(cid:11) = 1 gives
(cid:104)δz(0)δz(t)(cid:105) =(cid:10)δz2(cid:11) e−Dt/(cid:104)δz2(cid:105) .

The observed displacement
time-correlation-function
(FIG. 7) relaxes exponentially, conﬁrming the basic ki-
netic description. The slight deviation from exponen-
tial relaxation (FIG. 7) could be due to the lineariza-
tion w(cid:48)(z) ≈ κδz. The self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient is 1.7 ×
10−6cm2/s, about a factor of 10 less than a corresponding
value for liquid water, and about half of the self-diﬀusion
coeﬃcient of propylene carbonate [22]. Experimental
results for diﬀusion coeﬃcients of nonionic surfactants
range from 1× 10−6cm2/s to 8× 10−6cm2/s [23–26]. The
present value corresponds to relaxation times (cid:10)δz2(cid:11) /D
of about 2 ns (FIG. 7). Lateral diﬀusion is slightly faster
here (FIG.8), but slows slightly with increasing interface
loading.

With this value of D, we adapt the theory of ﬁrst pas-

sage times [21] to

with P (z, t|z0) the conditional probably density for a cen-

z after a time t from an initial location z0 [20]. Mo-
tions parallel to the interface, in the x and y directions,
are separable in this description. We will use this basis
to evaluate the mean ﬁrst passage time for escape of a
SPAN80 molecule from the interface. This description
uses w (z) obtained above, but requires also the kinetic
parameter D, a self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

To evaluate D, we ran another standard MD simu-
lation preserving suﬃcient time resolution. Speciﬁcally,
we extracted a windowed conﬁguration from the strongly
loaded interface simulation, then extended the MD sim-
ulation for 100 ns with conﬁgurations saved every 10 fs.
The ﬁrst 20 ns of this trajectory was discarded as fur-
ther aging, and we naturally used results for all SPAN80
molecules present. The centroid of a SPAN80 head-group
ring is followed with δz = 0 locating the minimum of w(z)
(FIG. 6). The centroid of a SPAN80 molecule head-group
ring wanders near the minimum of w (z), and we linearize

basis of a diﬀusional model and the desorption free ener-
gies are 7× 10−2 s (into the squalane) and 3× 102 h (into
the water), the latter value consistent with irreversible
absorption observed by recent experimental work [12] on
a related system.

IV. METHODOLOGICAL SPECIFICS

The GROMACS [27] 4.6.7 molecular dynamic simu-
lation package was used for all calculations. The chain
molecules were represented by OPLS-AA force ﬁeld [28]
and the SPC/E model [29] was chosen for water. The
Nose-Hoover thermostat [30] maintained the constant
temperature and Parrinello-Rahman barostat [31] kept
pressure at 1.0 atm. Long-range electrostatic interac-
tions were treated in standard periodic boundary condi-
tions using the particle mesh Ewald method with a cutoﬀ
of 1.0 nm. The chemical bonds involving hydrogen atoms
were constrained by the LINCS algorithm [32].

In evaluating surface tensions, we applied standard
MD simulation and checked the sampling suﬃciency
with parallel tempering calculations. Nine diﬀerent
surface loadings were investigated, with nSPAN80 =
1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 per interface. The squalane phase
included 75 squalane molecules and was bounded by
a water phase, bottom and top layers, of 1000 wa-
ter molecules.
For the highest loaded (nSPAN80 =
50/interface) and unloaded (nSPAN80 = 0/interface)
cases, a larger system of 100 squalane molecules and
3000 water molecules was simulated. We expanded the

pling approach used 190 windows to cover the whole z range.
Calculations for each window ran for 60 ns. w(z) is recom-
posed by the weighted histogram analysis method. The blue
band depicts statistical uncertainties of ±1 standard error es-
timated pointwise on the basis of a bootstrap resampling of
our results. These results show an energy barrier from inter-
face to squalane phase is around 8.7 kcal/mol and the energy
barrier from interface to bulk water is around 19.6 kcal/mol.

where ∆w(z) = w(z)− wmin, and δz‡ is the displacement
from the minimum at δz = 0 to the barrier conﬁguration.
We then ﬁnd (FIG. 6) the mean ﬁrst passage time of
0.07 s, from the interface to the squalane phase, while the
mean ﬁrst passage time from the interface to bulk water
is about 3 × 102 h. Diﬀerences in the barrier shapes in
the two directions play a role in determining that value,
since the ratio of these times is about a factor of four less
than the naive ratio of eβ∆w

III. CONCLUSIONS

These results suggest that loading only weakly aﬀects
accommodation of a SPAN80 molecule by this squalane-
water interface. Speciﬁcally, the surface tension equa-
tion of state (FIG. 4) is simple through the range of
high tension to high loading studied, and the desorption
free energy proﬁles are weakly dependent on loading here
(FIGs. 5 and 6). The free energy of transfer of a SPAN80
molecule from water to squalane is about -28 kcal/mol.
The perpendicular motion of the centroid of the SPAN80
head-group ring is well-described by a diﬀusional model
near the minimum of the desorption free energy proﬁle
(FIG. 7). Lateral diﬀusional motion is weakly dependent

system for those two cases to accommodate a consistent
comparison for desorption free energy evaluations. Our
standard procedure carried-out an energy minimization
calculation and density equilibration followed by a 100 ns
production run with constant particle number, pressure,
and temperature (NPT) conditions. The parallel temper-
ing calculations used 48 replicas spanning the 260-450K
temperature range. Trajectories ran for 50 ns and the
resulting exchange probability between neighboring tem-
peratures was around 20%.

We utilized the windows sampling approach to eval-
uate the desorption free energy proﬁle. To generate
initial conﬁgurations for each window, we placed one
more SPAN80 in the water phase at the position where
z = 1.0 nm. A pulling force was applied to the cen-
troid of the SPAN80 head-group ring to pull it across
the whole system. To achieve high resolution for w(z),
150 windows were used to cover the whole z range in
unloaded system while 190 windows are utilized to cover
the whole z range in strongly loaded system. Due to
the diﬀerent complexity between two cases, the extent
of the MD trajectory/window diﬀers. Trajectories ran
for 30 ns/window in unloaded case while the calculations
extended to 60 ns/window in the strongly loaded case.

and its dependence on loading. The plotted blue marks are
estimates of the time derivative of the solid lines. Lateral
diﬀusion coeﬃcients are slightly larger than the perpendicular
coeﬃcient (FIG. 7), but interfacial crowding has the expected
eﬀect of slowing the diﬀusion slightly.
