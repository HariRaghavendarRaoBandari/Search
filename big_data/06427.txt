THE SYMMETRIC SIGNATURE OF CYCLIC QUOTIENT

SINGULARITIES

ALESSIO CAMINATA AND LUKAS KATTHÄN

Abstract. The symmetric signature is an invariant of local domains which was
recently introduced by Brenner and the ﬁrst author in an attempt to ﬁnd a replace-
ment for the F -signature in characteristic zero. In the present note we compute the
symmetric signature for two-dimensional cyclic quotient singularities, i.e.
invariant
subrings kJu, vKG of rings of formal power series under the action of a cyclic group.
Equivalently, these rings arise as the completions (at the irrelevant ideal) of two-
dimensional normal toric rings. We show that for this class of rings the symmetric
signature coincides with the F -signature.

Introduction

The F -signature [HL02] or minimal relative Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity [WY04] is an
important invariant of local rings of positive characteristic. For a Noetherian local do-
main (R, m, k) of positive characteristic with algebraically closed residue ﬁeld k, the
F -signature of R is deﬁned as the limit

s(R) := lim

e→+∞

frkR
rankR

eR
eR

,

where eR denotes the ring R viewed as R-module with multiplicative structure twisted via
the e-th iterated Frobenius homomorphism. The notation rankR(−) stands for the usual
eR = pde, where p is the characteristic of
rank of an R-module, and we have that rankR
eR is the free rank of eR, that
the ring, and d the Krull dimension. The number frkR
is the maximum number of free direct R-summands of eR (see Deﬁnition 1.1). The F -
signature exists for every F -ﬁnite ring [Tuc12], and it is equal to 1 if and only if the ring
is regular [WY00]. In general, the F -signature provides delicate information concerning
the singularities of the ring.

For some classes of rings, the F -signature does not depend on the characteristic (in a
certain sense). This motivated Brenner and the ﬁrst author to introduce the symmetric
signature as an analogous invariant also for rings of characteristic zero [BC16]. They
consider q-th reﬂexive symmetric powers Sq of the top-dimensional syzygy module of the
residue ﬁeld and they study the asymptotic behaviour of the ratio frkR / rankR for this
class of modules, rather than eR as for the F -signature. If the limit

q=0 frkR Sq
PN
q=0 rankR Sq

exists, it is called symmetric signature of R and denoted by sσ(R) (see Deﬁnition 1.2).
We consider the symmetric signature for a special class of rings. A quotient singularity
is a ring of the form R = kJx1, . . . , xnKG where G is a small ﬁnite subgroup of GL(n, k)
whose order is not a multiple of the characteristic of k. It is known that the F -signature
of a quotient singularity is 1
|G| , cf. [WY04]. Brenner and the ﬁrst author showed that the
symmetric signature takes the same value in the case n = 2 and G ⊂ SL(n, k), i.e. for
two-dimensional special quotient singularities.

The main goal of this paper is to extend this result to two-dimensional cyclic quotient
singularities, i.e. the case n = 2 and G ⊂ GL(2, k) is cyclic. In fact we prove a slightly

stronger statement, namely we compute the generalized symmetric signature of these
rings (see 1.4 below).

The structure of the paper is the following. In Section 1 we review the deﬁnition of
symmetric signature and its generalized version. In Section 2 we state our main theo-
rem about the generalized symmetric signature of cyclic quotient singularities (Theorem
2.1), and we use the Auslander correspondence to reduce it to a problem concerning
group representations. This is proved in Section 3 by counting lattice points in a certain
polyhedron.

1. The Symmetric signature

Let (R, m, k) be a Noetherian local domain of Krull dimension d, we recall the deﬁnition
of symmetric signature from [BC16]. Given a ﬁnitely generated R-module M , we denote
by rankR M the rank of M , and we introduce a notation for the number of free summands.

Deﬁnition 1.1. The free rank of M is

frkR(M ) := max{n : ∃ a split surjection ϕ : M ։ Rn}.

For a natural number q, we denote by Symq

If the module M has ﬁnite rank, we can write it as M ∼= RfrkR(M) ⊕ N , where the
module N has no free direct R-summands. It follows that in general frkR M ≤ rankR M .
R(M ) the q-th symmetric powers of the
module M , and by M ∗ := HomR(M, R) the dual of M . The R-module M ∗∗ is always
reﬂexive and is called reﬂexive hull of M . The functor which sends M to Symq
R(M )∗∗ is
called q-th reﬂexive symmetric powers.

We consider the top-dimensional syzygy module of the residue ﬁeld Syzd

ring R is Cohen-Macaulay, then Syzd
module. Let q be a natural number, we apply q-th reﬂexive symmetric powers to Syzd
and we obtain a family of reﬂexive R-modules

R(k). If the
R(k) is a maximal Cohen-Macaulay (MCM for short)
R(k),

Sq := (cid:16)Symq

R (cid:0) Syzd

R(k)(cid:1)(cid:17)∗∗

.

Deﬁnition 1.2. The number

PN
q=0 frkR Sq
PN
q=0 rankR Sq
is called symmetric signature of R, provided the limit exists.

sσ(R) := lim

N→+∞

Example 1.3. If R is a regular ring, then the modules Sq are R-free. It follows that
frkR Sq = rankR Sq for all q, and consequently sσ(R) = 1.

Assume now that the category of ﬁnitely generated reﬂexive R-modules is a Krull-
Schmidt category. In this case we can also deﬁne a generalized symmetric signature. For
reﬂexive R-modules M, M ′ where M is indecomposable, we denote by

mult(M, M ′)

the multiplicity of M in M ′, i.e. the number of summands isomorphic to M in a decom-
position of M ′ into indecomposable modules.

Deﬁnition 1.4. The number

sσ(R, M ) := lim

N→+∞

PN
q=0 mult(M, Sq)
PN

q=0 rankR Sq

is called generalized symmetric signature of R with respect to M , provided the limit exists.

For further examples and properties of the symmetric signature, we refer to the paper
[BC16]. We mention that there is also an alternative version of the symmetric signature,
called diﬀerential symmetric signature, where the module Syzd
R(k) is replaced by the
module Ω∗∗
R/k of Zariski diﬀerentials of R over k. The two symmetric signatures share
many properties, but we will not consider the diﬀerential variant in this paper.

2. Quotient singularities

Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld k, and let G ⊆ GL(2, k) be a ﬁnite group, whose
order is not a multiple of the characteristic of k. Assume further that G is small, i.e. it
contains no pseudo-reﬂections.

The group G acts on S = kJu, vK via linear changes of variables, and we denote by R :=
SG the invariant ring under this action. The invariant ring R is called quotient singularity
and has the following properties: it is a Noetherian local domain of dimension 2, normal,
Cohen-Macaulay, complete, and an isolated singularity (see e.g. [BD08, Theorem 4.1]).
In particular, R has ﬁnite Cohen-Macaulay type, i.e.
there exist only ﬁnitely many
isomorphism classes of maximal Cohen-Macaulay R-modules. We denote by MCM(R)
the category of MCM R-modules, which is a Krull-Schmidt category since R is complete.
The ring R is Gorenstein if and only if G ⊆ SL(2, k) (see [Wat74a; Wat74b]), and in this
case R is called special quotient singularity. If G is a cyclic group, then R is called cyclic
quotient singularity. Note that cyclic quotient singularities are exactly the completion
of two-dimensional normal toric rings at their irrelevant ideal. (If R is a cyclic quotient
singularity, then we may assume that G acts diagonally, so R is the completion of a
subalgebra of k[u, v] which is generated by monomials and hence toric. On the other
hand, if R is a two-dimensional normal ring, then the so-called standard map [BG09, p.
55] yields a presentation of R as invariant subring of k[u, v] under the action of some
group G.)

Hashimoto and Nakajima [HN15] proved that if k has prime characteristic and M is
an indecomposable MCM R-module, then the generalized F -signature of R with respect
to M is

s(R, M ) =

|G|

rankR M

.

Brenner and the ﬁrst author [BC16] proved that the generalized symmetric signature
has the same value in the case of special quotient singularities. The main result of the
present paper is the corresponding statement for cyclic quotient singularities:

Theorem 2.1. Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld and let G ⊂ GL(2, k) be a small,
ﬁnite and cyclic group, such that char k does not divide |G|. Let R = kJu, vKG be the cor-
responding cyclic quotient singularity and let M be an indecomposable MCM R-module.
Then the generalized symmetric signature of R with respect to M equals

sσ(R, M ) =

1
|G|

.

To prove this result, we use the Auslander correspondence to reduce it into a group
theoretical statement (see 2.5 and Lemma 2.6), which is then proven in 3.1. If we choose
M = R in the previous theorem, we immediately get the following corollary.

Corollary 2.2. Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld and let G ⊂ GL(2, k) be a small,
ﬁnite and cyclic group, such that char k does not divide |G|. Then the symmetric signature
of the corresponding cyclic quotient singularity R = kJu, vKG is

sσ(R) =

1
|G|

.

2.1. The Auslander correspondence. There is a one-to-one correspondence, called
Auslander correspondence, between irreducible k-representations of G and indecompos-
able MCM R-modules. More precisely, we a have a functor A : mod(k[G]) → MCM(R)
called Auslander functor, from the category mod(k[G]) of linear k-representations of G
to the category of MCM R modules, given by A(V ) := (S ⊗k V )G. This functor is not an
equivalence of categories, but it has a right adjoint A′ given by A′(N ) := (S ⊗RN )∗∗ ⊗S k,
for every MCM R-module N .

We collect some properties of the functors A and A′ in the following theorem.

Theorem 2.3 (Auslander correspondence). The functors A : mod(k[G]) → MCM(R)
and A′ : MCM(R) → mod(k[G]) have the following properties.
1) A(V ) is indecomposable in MCM(R) if and only if V is an irreducible representation.

4

ALESSIO CAMINATA AND LUKAS KATTHÄN

2) A(A′(M )) ∼= M for every M ∈ MCM(R).
3) A′(A(V )) ∼= V for every V ∈ mod(k[G]).
4) rankR A(V ) = dimk V for every k-representation V .
5) If V, V ′ ∈ mod(k[G]) and V ′ is irreducible, then

mult(V ′, V ) = mult(A(V ′), A(V )).

We recall also that for a two-dimensional quotient singularity ﬁnitely generated MCM
R-modules coincide with ﬁnitely generated reﬂexive R-modules, and the indecomposable
MCM R-modules are exactly the R-direct summands of S by a result of Herzog [Her78].
Brenner and the ﬁrst author [BC16] proved that the Auslander functor commutes with
reﬂexive symmetric powers. Note that reﬂexive symmetric powers of a k-representation
are just ordinary symmetric powers, since every vector space is canonically isomorphic
to its double dual.

Theorem 2.4 ([BC16], Theorem 2.12). For every k-representation V of G, it holds that

Symq

R(A(V ))∗∗ ∼= A(Symq

k(V )).

For further details, and a review of the Auslander correspondence the reader may
consult the books of Leuschke and Wiegand [LW12], and of Yoshino [Yos90], or the ﬁrst
author’s Ph.D. thesis [Cam16].

In the present paper, we will use the following consequence of 2.4.

Corollary 2.5. Let M, M ′ be MCM R-modules and assume that M ′ is indecomposable.
Then the following holds:

(1) rankR Symq
(2) mult(M ′, Symq

R(M )∗∗ = dimk Symq

k(A′(M )), and
R(M )∗∗) = mult(A′(M ′), Symq

k(A′(M ))).

Proof. The ﬁrst item follows from the fact that

R(A(A′(M )))∗∗ ∼= A(Symq
and part 4) of 2.3. For the second equality, we compute that

R(M )∗∗ ∼= Symq

Symq

k(A′(M )))

mult(M ′, Symq

R(M )∗∗) = mult(A(A′(M ′)), A(Symq

k(A′(M ))))

= mult(A′(M ′), Symq

k(A′(M ))),

where we used the last part of 2.3.

(cid:3)

By this corollary, to prove 2.1 we need to consider the multiplicities of irreducible
representation of G inside the symmetric powers of a given representation of G. This will
be done in the next section. Before we turn to this, we need to show that the relevant
representation is faithful:

Lemma 2.6. Let G and R as in 2.1 and assume that G is cyclic. Then the representation
of G on A′(Syz2

R(k)) is faithful.

Proof. Let n := |G| and let g ∈ G be a generator for G. After a change of coordinates in
S = kJu, vK, we may assume that g acts as g · u = ξu and g · v = ξav for some primitive
n-th root of unity ξ ∈ k and a ∈ N, a < n. Moreover, G being small implies that a is
coprime to n.

Every monomial in S is an eigenvector under the action of G, hence the monomials
invariant under G form a k-basis of R. These are exactly the monomials uivj with
i + aj ≡ 0 mod n.
In particular, the maximal ideal mR of R has a minimal system
of generators p1, . . . , pµ consisting of monomials. We may assume that p1 = un and
p2 = un−av.

We consider p1, . . . , pµ as elements of S and let φ : Sµ → S be the map sending ei to

pi. Let F and be the kernel of φ and let N := S/(p1, . . . , pµ) be the cokernel of φ.

As S is a regular ring of dimension 2, the exact sequence

(1)

0 → F → Sµ φ

−→ S → N → 0

is a free resolution of N . In particular, F is a free S-module. As F is free, it is of the
form S ⊗k V for some representation V of G.

THE SYMMETRIC SIGNATURE OF CYCLIC QUOTIENT SINGULARITIES

5

We apply the exact G-invariant functor (_)G to sequence (1) and we get

0 → M → Rµ → R → k → 0.

Since p1, . . . , pµ is a system of generators of the maximal ideal of R, we obtain a copy
of the residue ﬁeld k in the last position. It follows that the module M is the second
syzygy of the residue ﬁeld, in other words Syz2
R(k) = M = (S ⊗k V )G = A(V ) and hence
A′(Syz2

R(k)) = V .

In order to show that G acts faithfully on V , it is enough to show that there exists an
element s ∈ V with a trivial stabilizer. For this we consider the element s := ve1 −uae2 ∈
Sµ. Clearly φ(s) = vp1 − uap2 = 0, so s ∈ F . Since (p1, . . . , pµ) ⊂ S is a monomial ideal
in two variables, it follows from Proposition 3.1 of [MS05] that s is a minimal generator
of F , so it corresponds to a non-zero element of V . The action of g on s is given by

g · s = ξavp1 − ξauap2 = ξas

Therefore, as a is coprime with n, the element s has a trivial stabilizer and hence G acts
faithfully on V .
(cid:3)

3. Representations and Lattice points

In view of 2.5 we need to consider multiplicities of irreducible representations of an
abelian group inside symmetric powers of a given representation. This is achieved in the
following theorem.

Theorem 3.1. Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld and G be a ﬁnite abelian group whose
order is not a multiple of char k. Let V, V ′ be a faithful and an irreducible k-representation
of G, respectively. Then it holds that

lim

N→+∞

PN
q=0 mult(V ′, Symq(V ))
PN

q=0 dimk Symq(V )

=

1
|G|

.

For the proof of the theorem, we ﬁrst prove two lemmas. We start with an elementary

result from group theory.

Lemma 3.2. Let n, ν ∈ N and let H ⊆ (Z/n)ν be a subgroup. Let further L be the kernel
of the map

ℓ : Zν → HomZ(H, Z/n)

given by x → (y 7→ Pi xiyi). Then [Zν : L] = |H|.
Proof. We ﬁrst show that |H| = | HomZ(H, Z/n)|. H is a ﬁnitely generated abelian
group, so it splits into a direct sum H = Li Hi of cyclic groups. Moreover, every Hi has
order divisible by n. The generator of a Hi of order u can be mapped to any element
whose order divides u in Z/n, and there are exactly u such elements. Hence

|H| = Y

i

|Hi| = Y

i

| HomZ(Hi, Z/n)| = | HomZ(H, Z/n)|.

Next we show that ℓ is surjective. We denote by h−, −i the standard scalar product,
i.e. ℓ(x)(y) = Pi xiyi = hx, yi. Let e1, . . . , eν be the unit vectors of (Z/n)ν . By the
elementary divisor theorem, there exists an invertible matrix A ∈ (Z/n)ν×ν , elements
α1, . . . , αr ∈ Z/n, r ≤ ν, and generators h1, . . . , hr of H, such that Ahi := αiei for
1 ≤ i ≤ r. It is clear that HomZ(H, Z/n) is generated by the maps ϕi sending hj to αj
for j = i and all other generators to zero. But the map ϕi is the image under ℓ of (an
arbitrary lifting to Zν of) the vector Atei, where At denotes the transpose of A:

ℓ(Atei)(hj ) = hAtei, hji = hei, Ahji

= hei, αjeji = αjδij = ϕi(hj),

where δij is the Kronecker symbol. So the claim follows.

Lemma 3.3. Let G, V and V ′ be as in 3.1, and let ν := dimk V . Then dimk Symq(V ) =
|{x ∈ Nν : |x| = q}| and there exists a lattice L ⊆ Zν and an a0 ∈ Zν such that

mult(V ′, Symq(V )) = |{x ∈ Nν ∩ (a0 + L) : |x| = q}|.

and [Zν : L] = |G|. Here |x| := Pi xi.
Proof. The representation V splits into one-dimensional representations V = Li Vi.
Let xi be a basis vector for Vi, then Sym V can be identiﬁed with the polynomial ring
k[x1, . . . , xν ]. It is clear that dimk Symq(V ) equals the number of monomials of degree
q, so the claimed formula holds.

G acts faithfully and diagonally on V = Li Vi, so we can identify it with a subgroup

G1 ⊆ (k∗)ν . The action of G1 is now given by

g · xa = gaxa,
is a monomial and ga := Qi gai

where xa = Qi xai
ρa(g) = ga. So, we obtain a map

i

For each point a ∈ Zν , we have a one-dimensional representation ρa : G1 → k∗,

i , g = (g1, . . . , gν).

ℓ : Zν → HomZ(G1, k∗)

a 7→ ρa.

Two points a and b are mapped to the same representation if and only if a − b ∈ ker ℓ.
Let L be the kernel of ℓ. We claim that [Zν : L] = |G1|. Let µn(k) ⊆ k∗ be the group of
n-th roots of unity. The order of every element of G1 is divisible by n, so G1 is in fact
a subgroup of µn(k)ν . Further, every ρa takes values in µn(k). Note that µn(k) is (not
canonically) isomorphic to Z/n and let G2 ⊂ (Z/n)ν be the image of G1 under such an
isomorphism. Then the map ℓ corresponds to the map

˜ℓ : Zν → HomZ(G2, Z/n),
aigi(cid:17),

a 7→ (cid:16)g 7→ X

i

and the claim follows from the preceding Lemma 3.2.

Now, since [Zν : L] = |G1| the lattice L divides Zν into |G1| cosets. On the other
hand, there are exactly |G1| irreducible representations, so there exists a0 ∈ Zν such that
ℓ(a0) is the representation V ′ which completes the proof.
(cid:3)

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 3.1.

Proof of 3.1. Let ν := dimk V and let L ⊆ Zν , a0 ∈ Zν be as in Lemma 3.3. Further,
let ∆ ⊂ Rν denote the simplex spanned by the origin and the unit vectors. By Lemma
3.3, PN
q=0 dimk Symq(V ) equals the number of lattice points in N ∆ = {N p : p ∈ ∆},
and PN
q=0 mult(V ′, Symq(V )) equals |N ∆ ∩ (a0 + L)|.

By choosing a basis for L we ﬁnd a ν × ν matrix A of full rank, such that L = AZν .
Note that by the elementary divisor theorem, A can be diagonalized and we see that
det A = [Zν : L]. Now we compute:

R(k), and we ﬁx V := A′(N ), and

mult(M, Symq
k(V )). By Theorem 2.3 V ′ is an irreducible repre-
sentation of G and by Lemma 2.6 V is a faithful representation of G. Thus, an application
