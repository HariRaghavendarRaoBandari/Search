1. Introduction

Turner’s Conjecture [Tu1, Conjecture 165] describes all blocks of symmetric
groups and Hecke algebras up to derived equivalence in terms of certain explicitly
constructed double algebras DQ(n, d), where Q is a quiver of ﬁnite type A. This
paper is the ﬁrst in a series of two papers where we prove Turner’s Conjecture.
To achieve this goal, in this paper we develop a general theory of Turner doubles,
which we believe is of independent interest.

For simplicity, in this introduction we describe the results only over the ground
ring Z. We ﬁx a Z-superalgebra X = X¯0 ⊕ X¯1 which is free of ﬁnite rank over Z.
Consider the invariants Invd X := (X ⊗d)Sd under the action of the symmetric
group Sd. This action depends crucially on the superstructure on X, as do the
structure and the dimension of Invd X and of all algebras deﬁned later in terms

of X. There is a natural superbialgebra structure on Inv X := Ld≥0 Invd X.

The Turner double is the superalgebra DX := Inv X ⊗ (Inv X)∗ with product
deﬁned in terms of the superbialgebra structures on Inv X and (Inv X)∗.

More precisely, (Inv X)∗ is naturally a superbimodule over Inv X, and the

product on DX is described, using Sweedler’s notation, as follows:

(ξ ⊗ x)(η ⊗ y) =X ± ξ(2)η(1) ⊗ (x · η(2))(ξ(1) · y),

for homogeneous ξ, η ∈ Inv X and x, y ∈ (Inv X)∗, with signs determined by
superalgebra data. We explain in §4.2 why this agrees with Turner’s deﬁnition in
[Tu3]. A key property of DX is that it is always a symmetric algebra. Moreover,
under some reasonable assumptions on X, the double DX as well as all other
algebras deﬁned later in terms of X are non-negatively graded. In this case, the
theorems below respect the gradings.

The superalgebra (Inv X)∗ can be identiﬁed with the symmetric superalge-
bra Sym(X ∗), which is naturally a sublattice in the divided power superalgebra
′Sym(X ∗). We show that the superalgebra structure on DX extends to that on

′DX := Inv X ⊗ ′Sym(X ∗). Thus DX ⊆ ′DX is a subsuperalgebra. Upon ex-
tension of scalars to a ﬁled K of characteristic 0, the embedding DX ⊆ ′DX
∼
−→ ′DX K. But, importantly, if K has positive
induces an isomorphism DXK
characteristic, the induced map is neither injective nor surjective.

Let TX = X ⊕ X ∗ be the trivial extension superalgebra of X, with the product
deﬁned by (ξ, x)(η, y) = (ξη, ξ · y + x · η) for ξ, η ∈ X and x, y ∈ X ∗. Let ∗

denote the shuﬄe product on Ld≥0(TX )⊗d. We show in Lemma 3.10 that there

∼
is a natural isomorphism κ : ′Sym(X ∗)
−→ Inv(X ∗). Our ﬁrst main result is the
following theorem, which often allows one to reduce the study of the double over
X to that of the invariants over TX.

Theorem A. We have:

(i) The map ϕ : ′DX → Inv TX, ξ ⊗ x 7→ ξ ∗ κ(x) is an isomorphism of

superalgebras.

(ii) The subalgebra ϕ(DX) ⊆ Inv TX is generated by Inv(X¯0) and all ele-

ments of the form t ∗ 1⊗d

X with t ∈ TX and d ≥ 0.

We have a natural superalgebra decomposition DX =Ld≥0 DdX, with

Inve X ⊗ (Invd−e X)∗,

DdX = M0≤e≤d

where the last direct sum is that of Z-modules, and similarly for ′DX. Then the
isomorphism ϕ of Theorem A restricts to isomorphisms ϕ : ′DdX ∼−→ Invd TX .
Let A be a Z-superalgebra which is free of ﬁnite rank over Z, and consider the
case where X is the matrix superalgebra Mn(A) for some ﬁxed n. In this case
we use the special notation

DA(n, d) := DdMn(A),

′DA(n, d) := ′DdMn(A).

We refer to the superalgebra DA(n, d) as a Schur double. The following theorem
shows that under a natural assumption, the subalgebra DA(n, d) ⊆ ′DA(n, d) is
a maximal symmetric subalgebra:

Theorem B. Let d ≤ n and C be a subalgebra of ′DA(n, d) such that DA(n, d) ⊆
C ⊆ ′DA(n, d). Suppose that for every prime p the Fp-algebra C ⊗Z Fp is sym-
metric. Then C = DA(n, d).

Let SA(n, d) := Invd Mn(A).

If A = Z, then SA(n, d) is just the (integral
version of) the classical Schur algebra. The generalized Schur algebras SA(n, d)
bear importance for the doubles, since, by Theorem A and the easy observation
∼= Mn(TA), we can identify ′DA(n, d) with STA(n, d) and DA(n, d)
that TMn(A)
with an explicit subalgebra of STA(n, d).

The superalgebras SA(n, d) can be studied using a generalized Schur-Weyl du-
ality with the super wreath product W A
d := A⊗d ⋊ kSd. The superalgebra Mn(A)
can be identiﬁed with EndA(V ), where V := A⊕n. The following generalized
version of Schur-Weyl duality is crucial for the proof of Turner’s Conjecture, but
is also of independent interest.

Theorem C. The natural left SA(n, d)-action and the natural right W A
on V ⊗d commute and yield an isomorphism SA(n, d) ∼= EndW A

(V ⊗d).

As a right W A

certain permutation supermodules M A

λ where λ runs over the set Λ(n, d) of all

For the purposes of Turner’s Conjecture, it is important to ‘desuperize’ this de-
scription of SA(n, d) in the case where A is a certain zigzag superalgebra Z de-
pending on a quiver Q. Let |X| denote the algebra obtained from a superalgebra
X by forgetting the superstructure. We construct a (rather delicate) explicit
isomorphism σ from the ordinary wreath product W |Z|
d |. Twisting with
d
this isomorphism makes the permutation module M Z
λ into an explicit alternating
sign permutation module M |Z|

to |W Z

λ over W |Z|

d . Then

|S Z(n, d)| ∼= End

W |Z|

d (cid:18) Mλ∈Λ(n,d)

M |Z|

λ (cid:19).

Using Theorems A,B,C, we obtain an explicit description of DQ(n, d) as a maxi-
mal symmetric subalgebra of the endomorphism algebra on the right hand side.
This description is used in [EK] to identify DQ(n, d) with an algebra Morita
equivalent to (a Z-form of) a RoCK block of a Hecke algebra or a more general
cyclotomic KLR algebra, thus proving Turner’s Conjecture.

Now we describe the contents of the paper in more detail.

In Section 2 we
set up some basic combinatorial notation. In Section 3 we discuss superspaces
and superalgebras, especially symmetric and divided power superalgebras and
various products and coproducts on them. In §3.4 we consider trivial extension
superalgebras. In Section 4 we begin to study Turner doubles. The properties of
invariant algebras Inv X are investigated in §4.1. The deﬁnition of DX is given
in §4.2, and its divided power version ′DX is studied in §4.3. For Theorem A see
Theorems 4.26 in §4.4 and 4.30 in §4.4. We discuss gradings on doubles in §4.5
and symmetricity of doubles in §4.6.

Section 5 is on generalized Schur-Weyl duality.

In §5.1 we discuss wreath
product algebras and permutation modules over them. In §5.2 we study the gen-
eralized tensor space, prove Theorem C (see Lemma 5.7) and discuss connections
with permutation modules over wreath product algebras. We consider idempo-
tent truncations of generalized Schur algebras in §5.3 and idempotent reﬁnements
of permutation modules in §5.4. Desuperization is discussed in §5.5.

Section 6 is on Schur doubles. In §6.1 we identify DA(n, d) with the subalgebra
of STA(n, d) generated by certain explicit elements. Theorem B is proved in §6.2,
see Theorem 6.6. In §6.3 we discuss bases and product rules of Schur doubles
and their divided power versions. Section 7 is on the important special case of
the quiver Schur (schiver) doubles. Quivers and zigzag algebras are considered in
§7.1. Finally, in §7.2, we discuss the degree zero component of a schiver double
and results related to schiver generation and desuperization, which will be needed
in [EK].

2. Preliminaries

Throughout the paper, k is an arbitrary commutative (unital) ring. In some
constructions, involving divided powers, we will need to work over a more special
ring O, which is assumed to be a (commutative) integral domain with ﬁeld of
fractions K of characteristic zero. We assume that there is a ﬁxed ring homomor-
phism O → k, which allows us to extend scalars from O to k, i.e. to consider

Vk := V ⊗O k

for any O-module V . If U and V are k-modules, we denote U ⊗ V := U ⊗k V .
Important examples of triples (K, O, k) are (Q, Z, Fp) and (Qp, Zp, Fp).

2.1. Weights and sequences. Let n ∈ Z>0 and d ∈ Z≥0. We denote by Λ(n)
the set of compositions λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) with n parts λ1, . . . , λn ∈ Z≥0. We
refer to the elements of Λ(n) as weights. For λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) ∈ Λ(n), we denote
|λ| := λ1 + · · · + λn. We set

Λ(n, d) := {λ ∈ Λ(n) | |λ| = d}.

More generally, if S is a ﬁnite set, we denote by Λ(S, d) the set of tuples (λs)s∈S of

non-negative integers such that Ps∈S λs = d. For S = [1, n], we identify Λ(S, d)

with Λ(n, d).

For 1 ≤ m ≤ n, we have special weights

εm := (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) ∈ Λ(n, 1),

with 1 in the mth position, so that

λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) = λ1ε1 + · · · + λnεn.

For m, n ∈ Z, we consider the (possibly empty) segments

[m, n] := {r ∈ Z | m ≤ r ≤ n},

(m, n] := {r ∈ Z | m < r ≤ n},

[m, n) := {r ∈ Z | m ≤ r < n}.

The symmetric group Sn acts naturally on the left on [1, n].

Let Seq(n, d) := [1, n]d be the set of (ordered) d-tuples r = (r1, . . . , rd) where
r1, . . . , rd ∈ [1, n]. The action of the symmetric group Sd on [1, d] yields the right
action of Sd on Seq(n, d) by place permutations: for r ∈ Seq(n, d) and g ∈ Sd,
we have rg = s where sa = rga for all a ∈ [1, d].

For λ ∈ Λ(n, d) we set

λSeq := {r ∈ Seq(n, d) | εr1 + · · · + εrd = λ}.

(2.1)

Then Seq(n, d) =Fλ∈Λ(n,d)

For λ ∈ Λ(n, d) we deﬁne

λSeq is the decomposition of Seq(n, d) into Sd-orbits.

rλ := (1, . . . , 1, 2, . . . , 2, . . . , n, . . . , n) ∈ λSeq,

where each r ∈ [1, n] is repeated λr times.

2.2. Integer-valued matrices and sequences. Deﬁne M(n) to be the set of
n × n-matrices with non-negative integer coeﬃcients. Let Er,s ∈ M(n) denote
the matrix unit with 1 in the (r, s)th position. For C = (cr,s)1≤r,s≤n ∈ M(n), we

set |C| :=Pn

r,s=1 cr,s, and we deﬁne

M(n, d) := {C ∈ M(n) | |C| = d}.

Given C, D ∈ M(n), deﬁne the integers

For any C ∈ M(n, d), we further set

cr,s!,

(cid:18)C
dr,s(cid:19).
D(cid:19) := Yr,s∈[1,n](cid:18)cr,s
C! = Yr,s∈[1,n]
α(C) :=(cid:0)Ps c1,s,Ps c2,s, . . . ,Ps cn,s(cid:1) ∈ Λ(n, d),
β(C) :=(cid:0)Pr cr,1,Pr cr,2, . . . ,Pr cr,n(cid:1) ∈ Λ(n, d).

Let λ, µ ∈ Λ(n, d). Deﬁne

µM(n, d)λ := {C ∈ M(n, d) | α(C) = µ and β(C) = λ}.

The subsets of M(n) and M(n, d) consisting of {0, 1}-matrices are denoted by

′M(n) := {C ∈ M(n) | cr,s ∈ {0, 1} for all 1 ≤ r, s ≤ n},

′M(n, d) := M(n, d) ∩ ′M(n).

In §6.3, we will use the following generalization. Let B = B¯0 ⊔ B¯1 be a set split

as a disjoint union of two subsets B¯0 and B¯1. Set

MB(n) := {C = (C b)b∈B | C b ∈ M(n) for b ∈ B¯0, C b ∈ ′M(n) for b ∈ B¯1}.

Let C = (C b)b∈B ∈ MB(n). For every b ∈ B, we write C b = (cb

|C|¯0 :=Pb∈B¯0

|C b|, |C|¯1 :=Pb∈B¯1

|C b|,

|C| := |C|¯0 + |C|¯1 =Xb∈B

Let C = (C b)b∈B and D = (Db)b∈B ∈ MB(n). We deﬁne C + D by (C + D)b =
C b + Db for all b ∈ B. Note that C + D may or may not be an element of MB(n).
We set

C! :=Yb∈B

C b! = Yb∈B¯0

C b!, (cid:18)C

Db(cid:19).
D(cid:19) :=Yb∈B(cid:18)C b

Deﬁne SeqB(n, d)2 to be the set of tuples
(r, b, s) = ((r1, . . . , rd), (b1, . . . , bd), (s1, . . . , sd)) ∈ Seq(n, d) × Bd × Seq(n, d)

such that for any distinct k, l ∈ [1, d] with (rk, bk, sk) = (rl, bl, sl) we have bk ∈ B¯0.
The left action of Sd on [1, d] induces a right action on each component of the
direct product Seq(n, d) × Bd × Seq(n, d) as in §2.1, so we have a right action of
Sd on SeqB(n, d)2. There is a bijection

SeqB(n, d)2/Sd

∼
−→ MB(n, d), (r, b, s) 7→ M [r, b, s] := ((cb

6

where

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

cb
r,s = ♯{k ∈ [1, d] | (rk, bk, sk) = (r, b, s)}.

We always identify SeqB(n, d)2/Sd with MB(n, d) via this bijection. In particular,
given C ∈ MB(n, d), we write (r, b, s) ∈ C if M [r, b, s] = C.

2.3. Cosets. Let (S, <) be a totally ordered ﬁnite set. Recall the notation Λ(S, d)
from §2.1. Let λ = (λs)s∈S ∈ Λ(S, d). The corresponding standard set partition
Ωλ is the partition of [1, d] into the segments

Ωλ

s :=(cid:0)Pt<s λt,Pt≤s λt(cid:3)

(s ∈ S).

Note that the segment Ωλ
standard parabolic subgroup

s has λs elements. Write S = {s1 < · · · < sn}. The

Sλ

∼= Sλs1

× · · · × Sλsn ≤ Sd

(2.5)

preserves the set partition Ωλ. If λ ∈ Λ(n, d), we deﬁne Ωλ and Sλ via the usual
total order on [1, n].

Let λ ∈ Λ(S, d) and D λ be the set of shortest coset representatives for Sd/Sλ,
where the length ℓ(g) of an element g ∈ Sλ is the smallest integer ℓ such that g can
be represented as a product of ℓ transpositions of the form (r, r + 1), 1 ≤ r < d.
For µ ∈ Λ(S, d), we also have the set µD of shortest coset representatives for
Sµ\Sd and the set µD λ of shortest double coset representatives for Sµ\Sd/Sλ.
Note that we have a bijection

µD → µSeq, rµ 7→ rµg

(2.6)

and a bijection µD → D µ, g 7→ g−1.

It is well known and easy to see (cf. e.g. [JK, 1.3.10]) that for every C =

(cr,s) ∈ µM(n, d)λ there exists a unique element g(C) ∈ µD λ such that

|g(C)(Ωλ

s ) ∩ Ωµ

r | = cr,s

for all r, s ∈ [1, n]. Moreover:

Lemma 2.7. For any λ, µ ∈ Λ(n, d), the map C 7→ g(C) deﬁnes a bijection

µM(n, d)λ

∼
−→ µD λ.

Given C = (cr,s) ∈ µM(n, d)λ and 1 ≤ s ≤ n, we have a composition

c∗,s := (c1,s, . . . , cn,s) ∈ Λ(n, λs).

Given elements g1 ∈ Sλ1 , . . . , gn ∈ Sλn, we consider (g1, . . . , gn) ∈ Sλ1 ×· · ·×Sλn
as an element of Sd via the natural embedding of Sλ1 ×· · ·×Sλn into Sd. Another
easy and well-known result (see e.g. [DJ, Lemma 1.6]) is:

Lemma 2.8. Let λ, µ ∈ Λ(n, d). There is a bijection

{(C, g1, . . . , gn) | C ∈ µM(n, d)λ, gs ∈ c∗,s D for s = 1, . . . , n} ∼−→ µD

deﬁned by (C, g1, . . . , gn) 7→ g(C)(g1, . . . , gn).

3. Superspaces and superalgebras

From now on, we write Z2 := Z/2Z = {¯0, ¯1}. Let V = V¯0 ⊕ V¯1 be a free
k-supermodule of ﬁnite rank. We refer to V as a (k-)superspace. The k-rank of
V is denoted by dim V . For parities of elements, we write ¯v = ¯0 if v ∈ V¯0 and
¯v = ¯1 if v ∈ V¯1. Whenever ¯v appears in a formula, this means that we assume
that v is a homogeneous element. If V is an (associative unital) k-superalgebra,
we denote by |V | the same algebra without the Z2-grading.

By a Z-supergrading on a superspace V we mean a Z-grading V =Lm∈Z V m

such that V m = (V m ∩ V¯0) ⊕ (V m ∩ V¯1) for all m ∈ Z.

3.1. Dual superspaces and tensor products. The dual V ∗ := Homk(V, k) is
a superspace in a natural way. We have the pairing h·, ·i between V and V ∗:

hv, βi = hβ, vi := β(v)

(v ∈ V, β ∈ V ∗).

Let d ∈ Z>0, and V1, . . . , Vd be superspaces. The tensor product V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vd
is again a superspace in a natural way. We always identify (V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vd)∗ with
1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ V ∗
V ∗

d via

hβ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ βd, v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vdi := (−1)[β1,...,βd;v1,...,vd]hβ1, v1i . . . hβd, vdi,

(3.1)

where βa ∈ V ∗

a , va ∈ Va for a = 1, . . . , d, and where

[β1, . . . , βd; v1, . . . , vd] := X1≤a<c≤d

¯βc¯va

(3.2)

is deﬁned for (homogeneous) elements β1, . . . , βd, v1, . . . , vd of arbitrary super-
spaces. Note that

hβ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ βd, v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vdi = hv1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vd, β1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ βdi

:= (−1)[v1,...,vd;β1,...,βd]hv1, β1i . . . hvd, βdi,

since hva, βai = 0 unless ¯va = ¯βa for any 1 ≤ a ≤ d.

If V1, . . . , Vd are k-superalgebras, then V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vd is again a superalgebra

with

(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vd)(w1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ wd) = (−1)[v1,...,vd;w1,...,wd]v1w1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vdwd,

for va, wa ∈ Va, a = 1, . . . , d.

The symmetric group Sd acts on the superspace V ⊗d on the right by (super)

place permutations. More precisely, for g ∈ Sd and v1, . . . , vd ∈ V , we deﬁne

[g; v1, . . . , vd] :=

X1≤a<c≤d, g−1a>g−1c

¯va¯vc,

(3.3)

and

(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vd)g := (−1)[g;v1,...,vd]vg1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vgd.

(3.4)

If V is a superalgebra, then Sd acts on V ⊗d with algebra automorphisms.

3.2. Symmetric and divided power superalgebras. Recall that O is a do-
main of characteristic zero. Let V = V¯0 ⊕ V¯1 be an O-superspace with bases
B¯0 = {x1, . . . , xl} of V¯0 and B¯1 = {xl+1, . . . , xl+m} of V¯1. Then B = B¯0 ⊔ B¯1 is a
homogeneous basis of V . We identify Vk := V ⊗O k with the free k-supermodule
with basis B, and we identify V with the O-subsupermodule V ⊗ 1 ⊆ VK.

For every d ∈ Z≥0, consider the O-superspace
Tensd V := V ⊗d.

Let

Tens V := Md∈Z≥0

Tensd V

be the tensor superalgebra of V and Sym V = Ld∈Z≥0

Symd V be the symmetric
superalgebra on V . That is, Sym V is the quotient of Tens V by the ideal generated
by all elements of the form v ⊗ u − (v ⊗ u)(1,2) for u, v ∈ V and all elements of
the form v ⊗ v for v ∈ V¯1. Moreover, for every d ∈ Z≥0, the subsuperspace
Symd V ≤ Sym V is the intersection of Sym V with the subsuperspace Tensd V of
Tens V .

We consider Sym V as an O-form of Sym VK. We will also need another O-

of Sym VK generated by the divided powers v(m) := vm/m! for all v ∈ V¯0 and
m ∈ Z≥0 together with all v ∈ V¯1. We now deﬁne ′Sym Vk := (′Sym V ) ⊗O k and
write v(m) := v(m) ⊗ 1 ∈ ′Sym Vk.

form. The divided powers superalgebra ′Sym V =L ′Symd V is the O-subalgebra
For every d ∈ Z≥0, we have the ﬁxed points Invd V := (cid:0) Tensd V )Sd of the
action (3.4) and set Inv V := Ld≥0 Invd V. It is a subalgebra of Tens V with

For d, e ∈ Z≥0, recall that (d,e)D stands for the set of the shortest coset repre-

sentatives for (Sd × Se)\Sd+e. We consider the linear map

Tensd V ⊗ Tense V → Tensd+e V, t ⊗ s 7→ t ∗ s,

deﬁned by

(x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xd) ∗ (y1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ye) := Xg∈(d,e)D

(x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xd ⊗ y1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ye)g (3.5)

for all x1, . . . , xd, y1, . . . , ye ∈ V . This new ∗-product (or shuﬄe product) on
Tens V makes it an associative supercommutative superalgebra. Moreover, Inv V
is a subsuperalgebra of Tens V with respect to the ∗-product.

Let V = U ⊕ W be a direct sum decomposition of O-supermodules. For every
e ≥ 0, we identify Tense U and Tense W with subsupermodules of Tense V in the
obvious way. The following is easy to see:

Lemma 3.6. Let d ∈ Z≥0. For every e ∈ [0, d], the O-supermodule homomor-
phism

Inve U ⊗ Invd−e W → Invd V, s ⊗ t 7→ s ∗ t

is injective, and we have a direct sum decomposition of O-superspaces:

3.3. Coproducts. We can also consider Tens V as a supercoalgebra, with the
coproduct

∆ : Tensd V → Me,f ≥0, e+f =d
v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vd 7→ Xe,f ≥0, e+f =d

Tense V ⊗ Tensf V,

(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ve) ⊗ (ve+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vd).

(3.11)

For a supercoalgebra (X, ∆) and x ∈ X, we repeatedly use Sweedler’s notation

where x(1) and x(2) are homogeneous whenever x is.

∆(x) =X x(1) ⊗ x(2)

The following is a superalgebra version of the well-known fact (see e.g. [Re,

Proposition 1.9]) that Tens V is a bialgebra with respect to (∗, ∆):

Lemma 3.12. Let s, t ∈ Tens V . Then

∆(s ∗ t) =X(−1)¯s(2)¯t(1) (s(1) ∗ t(1)) ⊗ (s(2) ∗ t(2)).

Proof. We may assume that s = s1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ sa and t = t1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ tb for some
s1, . . . , sa, t1, . . . , tb ∈ V . Let πe,f be the projection from Tens V ⊗ Tens V onto

the summand Tense V ⊗ Tensf V . Fix e ∈ [0, a + b] and denote by P(C,g1,g2)

the sum over all triples (C, g1, g2) corresponding to taking λ = (e, a + b − e) and
µ = (a, b) in Lemma 2.8. Then using that lemma, we get

⊗ (sc1,1+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ sa ⊗ tc2,1+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ tb)g2

where m = (¯t1 + · · · + ¯tc2,1)(¯sc1,1+1 + · · · + ¯sa). This completes the proof.

(cid:3)

Note that Inv V is a subsupercoalgebra of Tens V . The supercoalgebra Inv V

is supercocommutative, i.e. if ∆(ξ) = P ξ(1) ⊗ ξ(2) in Sweedler’s notation for a

(homogeneous) ξ ∈ Inv V , then

¯ξ(2)ξ(2) ⊗ ξ(1).

(3.13)

Hence the (restricted) dual

¯ξ(1)

∆(ξ) =X(−1)
(Inv V )∗ :=Md≥0

(Invd V )∗

has a superalgebra structure which is dual to the coalgebra structure on Inv V .
More precisely, the superbialgebra structure on (Inv V )∗ is determined by the
identity

hξη, xi = hξ ⊗ η, ∆(x)i

(ξ, η ∈ (Inv V )∗, x ∈ Inv X),

where as usual we identify (Inv V )∗ ⊗ (Inv V )∗ with (Inv V ⊗ Inv V )∗ via (3.1).
This makes (Inv V )∗ a supercommutative superalgebra. Given ξ1, . . . , ξd ∈ V ∗,
we have the functional ξ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξd ∈ (Tensd V )∗. Extending by zero to the whole
Tens V and restricting to Inv V , we can interpret ξ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξd as an element of
(Inv V )∗. The following is now clear:

Lemma 3.14. The natural map V ∗ → (Inv V )∗ extends to the isomorphism of
superalgebras Sym(V ∗) ∼−→ (Inv V )∗, which maps any product ξ1 · · · ξd ∈ Symd(V ∗)
with ξ1, . . . , ξd ∈ V ∗ to the functional ξ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξd ∈ (Inv V )∗.

Corollary 3.15. Identifying the O-submodule ′Sym(V ∗) ⊆ Sym(V ∗
submodule of (Inv VK)∗ via Lemma 3.14, we have

K) with an O-

Star V = {x ∈ Inv VK | hx, ξi ∈ O for all ξ ∈ ′Sym(V ∗)}.

Proof. Recall the basis B = {x1, . . . , xl+m} of V , and let {ξ1, . . . , ξl+m} be the
dual basis of V ∗. By Lemma 3.10,

{x∗c := x∗c1

1 ∗ · · · ∗ x∗cl+m

l+m | c = (c1, . . . , cl+m) ∈ MB}

is an O-basis of Star V . On the other hand,

{ξ(c) := ξ(c1)

1

· · · ξ(cl+m)

l+m | c = (c1, . . . , cl+m) ∈ MB}

is an O-basis of ′Sym(V ∗). It remains to note that hx∗c, ξ(d)i = ±δc,d.

3.4. Trivial extension algebras. Let A be a k-superalgebra. We consider A∗
as an A-bimodule with respect to the dual regular actions given by
(a, b ∈ A, α ∈ A∗).

hα · a, bi = hα, abi, hb, a · αi = hba, αi

(3.16)

We refer to this bimodule as the dual regular superbimodule.

The trivial extension superalgebra TA of A is TA = A ⊕ A∗ as a superspace,

with multiplication

(a, α)(b, β) = (ab, a · β + α · b)

(a, b ∈ A, α, β ∈ A∗).

(3.17)

Let m : A ⊗ A → A be the multiplication map on A and

m∗ : A∗ → A∗ ⊗ A∗

notation. Then

be the dual map. For α ∈ A∗, we write m∗(α) =P α(1) ⊗ α(2) using Sweedler’s
hbc, αi = hb ⊗ c, m∗(α)i = hb ⊗ c,X α(1) ⊗ α(2)i =X(−1)¯c ¯α(1)hb, α(1)ihc, α(2)i,
hα, bci = hm∗(α), b ⊗ ci = hX α(1) ⊗ α(2), b ⊗ ci =X(−1) ¯α(2)

Note that the right hand sides above are equal to each other since hα(1), bi = 0
unless ¯α(1) = ¯b and hα(2), ci = 0 unless ¯α(2) = ¯c. The formulas imply that for any
a ∈ A and α ∈ A∗, we have

¯bhα(1), bihα(2), ci.

a · α =X(−1)¯a ¯α(1)ha, α(2)iα(1),
α · a =X(−1) ¯α(2)¯aha, α(1)iα(2).

4. Turner doubles

In this section, we review and develop Turner’s theory of doubles [Tu1, Tu2,
Tu3]. We will freely use the notation and conventions of Section 3. Let X
be an O-superalgebra, free of ﬁnite rank as an O-supermodule. We consider
Xk = X ⊗O k as a k-superalgebra.

4.1. Invariants. For d ∈ Z≥0 we have a superalgebra structure on Tensd X :=
X ⊗d induced by that on X. So we have a (locally-unital) superalgebra structure

on Tens X :=Ld≥0 Tensd X, with the product on each summand Tensd X being

as above, and xy = 0 for x ∈ Tensd X and y ∈ Tense X with d 6= e. Note
that this algebra structure is diﬀerent from the two algebra structures on Tens X
considered in §3.2, namely the product ⊗ and the product ∗.

In fact, Tens X is now even a superbialgebra with the coproduct (3.11). Since
Sd acts on Tensd X with superalgebra automorphisms, the ﬁxed points Invd X =
(Tensd X)Sd is a subsuperalgebra of Tensd X. By observations made in §3.3,

Inv X =Ld≥0 Invd X is a supercocommutative subsuperbialgebra of Tens X.

Lemma 4.1. Let x, y ∈ Tens X and z ∈ Inv X. Then

(x ∗ y)z =X(−1)¯y ¯z(1)(xz(1)) ∗ (yz(2)),
z(x ∗ y) =X(−1)¯z(2) ¯x(z(1)x) ∗ (z(2)y).

Proof. We may assume that z ∈ Invd X, x ∈ Tense X and y ∈ Tensd−e X for

some non-negative integers d ≥ e. WriteP′ z(1) ⊗ z(2) for the Inve X ⊗ Invd−e X-

component of ∆(z). Then, since z is Sd-invariant, we have

(x ∗ y)z = Xg∈ (e,d−e)D

where the last equality holds because a summand on the right hand side is zero
unless z(1) ∈ Inve X and z(2) ∈ Invd−e X. The second equality in the lemma is
proved similarly.
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.2. Let x, y, z, u ∈ Inv X. Then

(x ∗ y)(z ∗ u) =X(−1)s(x(1)z(1)) ∗ (y(1)z(2)) ∗ (x(2)u(1)) ∗ (y(2)u(2)),

where s = (¯x(2) + ¯y(2))¯z + ¯y(1)(¯x(2) + ¯z(1)) + ¯y(2) ¯u(1).

Proof. Writing ∆(x ∗ y) =P(x ∗ y)(1) ⊗ (x ∗ y)(2), we have
(x ∗ y)(z ∗ u) =X(−1)(x∗y)(2) ¯z((x ∗ y)(1)z) ∗ ((x ∗ y)(2)u)

=X(−1)(¯x(2)+¯y(2))¯z+¯y(1) ¯x(2)((x(1) ∗ y(1))z) ∗ ((x(2) ∗ y(2))u)
=X(−1)s(x(1)z(1)) ∗ (y(1)z(2)) ∗ (x(2)u(1)) ∗ (y(2)u(2)),

where s = (¯x(2) + ¯y(2))¯z + ¯y(1) ¯x(2) + ¯y(1) ¯z(1) + ¯y(2) ¯u(1) is as in the statement of the
lemma, the ﬁrst and third equalities hold by Lemma 4.1, and the second one is
due to Lemma 3.12.
(cid:3)

Lemma 4.3. Let l ∈ Z>0, d1, . . . , dl, f1, . . . , fl ∈ Z≥0, and 1X = e1 + · · · + el
with eiej = δi,jei for all i, j. If xi ∈ (Tensdi X)e⊗di
(Tensdi X) for
i = 1, . . . , l, then
(x1 ∗ · · · ∗ xl)(y1 ∗ · · · ∗ yl) = (−1)[x1,...,xl;y1,...,yl]δd1,f1 . . . δdl,fl(x1y1) ∗ · · · ∗ (xlyl).
Proof. Let λ = (d1, . . . , dl) and µ = (f1, . . . , fl). Note that (x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xl)g(y1 ⊗
· · · ⊗ yl)h = 0 if g ∈ λD, h ∈ µD and either λ 6= µ or g 6= h. Since Sd acts on
Tensd X with superalgebra automorphisms for every d, the result follows.

Corollary 4.4. If X = X1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Xl is a direct sum of superalgebras, then there
is an isomorphism of superalgebras

Invd1 X1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Invdl Xl

∼
−→ Invd X, x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xl 7→ x1 ∗ · · · ∗ xl.

Proof. This follows from Lemmas 3.6 and 4.3.

(cid:3)

Recall from from §3.4 that we consider X ∗ as a bimodule over X. Note for

d ∈ Z≥0 that Tensd(X ∗) is naturally a bimodule over Tensd X with respect to
(x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xd) · (ξ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξd) = (−1)[x1,...,xd;ξ1,...,ξd](x1 · ξ1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ (xd · ξd), (4.5)

14

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

where x1, . . . , xd ∈ X and ξ1, . . . , ξd ∈ X ∗, or ξ1, . . . , ξd ∈ X and x1, . . . , xd ∈
X ∗. As usual, if d 6= e we deﬁne the action trivially: Tensd X · Tense(X ∗) =
Tense(X ∗) · Tensd X = 0. This yields a Tens X-bimodule structure on Tens(X ∗).
Upon restriction, we now get an Inv X-superbimodule structure on Inv(X ∗). We
refer to this superbimodule structure as the standard superbimodule structure.
On the other hand, we have the dual regular Inv X-superbimodule structure on
(Inv X)∗, see (3.16). By Lemmas 3.14 and 3.10, we have an embedding

ι : (Inv X)∗ ∼−→ Sym(X ∗) ֒→ ′Sym(X ∗) ∼−→ Inv(X ∗).

(4.6)

Lemma 4.7. The embedding ι is a homomorphism of Inv X-bimodules.

Proof. Every element of Inv(X ∗) is by deﬁnition a linear combination of func-
tions of the form ξ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξd with ξ1, . . . , ξd ∈ X ∗. On the other hand, by
Lemma 3.14, (Inv X)∗ is spanned by the functions of the form (ξ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξd)|Inv X
with ξ1, . . . , ξd ∈ X ∗, and

ι((ξ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξd)|Inv X ) = ξ1 ∗ · · · ∗ ξd.

Note that

(ξ1 ∗ · · · ∗ ξd)|Inv X = d!(ξ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξd)|Inv X .

We have proved for any ξ ∈ Tensd(X ∗) that

ι(ξ|Inv X )|Inv X = d!ξ|Inv X.

(4.8)

Let x ∈ Inv X. We now prove that ι(x · (ξ|Inv X)) = x · ι(ξ|Inv X), the proof

that ι((ξ|Inv X ) · x) = ι(ξ|Inv X) · x being similar. Using (4.8), we get

ι(x · (ξ|Inv X ))|Inv X = ι((x · ξ)|Inv X )|Inv X = d!(x · ξ)|Inv X = d! x · (ξ|Inv X )

= x ·(cid:0)(ι(ξ|Inv X))|Inv X(cid:1) = (x · ι(ξ|Inv X ))|Inv X .

To prove that ι(x · (ξ|Inv X)) = x · ι(ξ|Inv X) it now suﬃces to show that the
map Inv(X ∗) → (Inv X)∗ given by η 7→ η|Inv X is injective. Let η ∈ Invd(X ∗)
satisfy η|Inv X = 0. Since d!(′Sym(X ∗)) ⊆ Sym(X ∗), we can write d!η = ι(ξ|Inv X)
for some ξ ∈ Tensd(X ∗). Then, using (4.8),

0 = d!η|Inv X = ι(ξ|Inv X )|Inv X = d!ξ|Inv X

Hence ξ|Inv X = 0. But ι(ξ|Inv X ) = d!η, whence η = 0, as desired.

(cid:3)

Recall the trivial extension algebra TX = X ⊕ X ∗ from §3.4. For d, e ∈ Z≥0,
we deﬁne Tensd,e TX to be the span in Tensd+e TX of pure tensors y1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ yd+e
such that d of the y’s are in X and e of the y’s are in X ∗. We identify Tensd X
with Tensd,0 TX and Tensd(X ∗) with Tens0,d TX in the obvious way. Then for
ξ ∈ Tensd X and x ∈ Tense(X ∗), we have

ξx = ξ · x and xξ = x · ξ,

where the left hand sides are products in the algebra Tensd TX and the right
hand sides are the standard actions in the sense of (4.5). (Note the change of our
notational ‘paradigm’: from now on we use Greek letters to denote elements of
Tens X and Roman letters for elements of Tens(X ∗).)

TURNER DOUBLES AND GENERALIZED SCHUR ALGEBRAS

Lemma 4.9. Let a, b, d ∈ Z≥0 with a, b ≤ d. Suppose that x ∈ Inva(X ∗),
y ∈ Invb(X ∗), ξ ∈ Invd−a X, and η ∈ Invd−b X. Then in Invd TX we have
¯ξ(1)(¯ξ(2)+¯η+¯x)+¯η(1) ¯xξ(2)η(1) ∗ (x · η(2)) ∗ (ξ(1) · y).

(ξ ∗ x)(η ∗ y) =X(−1)

Proof. Since X ∗X ∗ = 0 in TX, the result follows from (3.13) and Lemma 4.2. (cid:3)

4.2. Doubles. We have a natural pairing h·, ·i between Inv X and (Inv X)∗, with
hx, ξi = hξ, xi = 0 for ξ ∈ Invd X and x ∈ (Inve X)∗ with d 6= e. Also, for every
d ∈ Z≥0 we have the dual regular actions (3.16) of Invd X on (Invd X)∗. Again,
we declare that ξ · x = x · ξ = 0 if ξ ∈ Invd X and x ∈ (Inve X)∗ with d 6= e.
There is a superbialgebra structure on (Inv X)∗ which is dual to that on Inv X.
We write

(4.10)
for the corresponding coproduct. Note that ∇((Invd X)∗) ⊆ (Invd X)∗⊗(Invd X)∗
for all d ∈ Z≥0.

∇ : (Inv X)∗ → (Inv X)∗ ⊗ (Inv X)∗

We now recall Turner’s construction [Tu3] of a double superalgebra DX. As

an O-superspace,

DX := Inv X ⊗ (Inv X)∗.

The product is deﬁned, using Sweedler’s notation for ∆, as follows:

¯ξ(1)(¯ξ(2)+¯η+¯x)+¯η(1) ¯xξ(2)η(1) ⊗ (x · η(2))(ξ(1) · y)

(4.11)

(ξ ⊗ x)(η ⊗ y) =X(−1)

for ξ, η ∈ Inv X and x, y ∈ (Inv X)∗. The associativity of the product can
be checked by a straightforward computation, cf. [Tu3, Theorem 1.1]. In view
of (3.18) and (3.19), this product formula can be rewritten, using Sweedler’s
notation for ∆ and ∇, to match [Tu3, Remark 1.3]:

(ξ ⊗ x)(η ⊗ y) =X(−1)shξ(1), y(2)ihx(1), η(2)iξ(2)η(1) ⊗ x(2)y(1),

where

(4.12)

s = ¯ξ(1)

¯ξ(2) + ¯ξ(1) ¯η(1) + ¯x(2) ¯y(2) + ¯y(1) ¯y(2) + ¯x(1) ¯η(1) + ¯x(2) ¯η(2) + ¯x(2) ¯η(1).

It is easy to see that we can write the superalgebra DX as a direct sum of

subsuperalgebras

where

DdX,

DX =Md≥0
DdX := Me,f ≥0, e+f =d

Inve X ⊗ (Invf X)∗.

(4.13)

We use the following notation for the summands on the right hand side above:

De,f X := Inve X ⊗ (Invf X)∗.

(4.14)

Remark 4.15. The deﬁnition of the double DdX makes sense for any k-algebra
X, without any assumption on the ring k. We also note that Lemmas 4.1, 4.2,
and 4.9 do not need the assumption that k = O. However, it is crucial to work
over O when we deal with the divided power version ′DdX below.

16

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

Remark 4.16. The direct sum decomposition in (4.13) is a priori only a decom-
position of O-modules. But one can say a little more.

(i) Dd,0X is a subalgebra of DdX naturally isomorphic to the algebra Invd X.
(ii) D0,dX is an ideal in DdX. Moreover,

(De,f X)(D0,dX) = (D0,dX)(De,f X) = 0

unless e = d, in which case for ξ ∈ Invd X and x ∈ (Invd X)∗, we have

(ξ ⊗ 1)(1 ⊗ x) = 1 ⊗ (ξ · x),

(1 ⊗ x)(ξ ⊗ 1) = 1 ⊗ (x · ξ).

(4.17)

(4.18)

In particular, Dd,0X ⊕ D0,dX is a subalgebra of DdX, isomorphic to TInvd X. As
a still more special case, we get D1X ∼= TX .

4.3. Divided power doubles. In view of Lemma 3.14, we identify the superal-
gebras

(Inv X)∗ = Sym(X ∗).

(4.19)

Then

Sym(X ∗) ⊆ ′Sym(X ∗) ⊆ Sym(X ∗) ⊗O K ∼= Sym(X ∗

K) = (Inv XK)∗,

where we have used the identiﬁcation (4.19) over K for the last equality. We have
the left and right dual regular actions of Inv XK on (Inv XK)∗. Since Inv X ⊆
Inv XK in a natural way, we can also speak of the dual regular actions of Inv X
on (Inv XK)∗.

Lemma 4.20. The O-submodule ′Sym(X ∗) ⊂ (Inv XK)∗ is invariant with re-
spect to the dual regular actions of Inv X on (Inv XK)∗. Thus, ′Sym(X ∗) is
an Inv X-superbimodule. With respect to this Inv X-superbimodule structure
on ′Sym(X ∗) and the standard Inv X-superbimodule structure on Inv(X ∗), the
map κ : ′Sym(X ∗) ∼−→ Inv(X ∗) of Lemma 3.10 is an isomorphism of Inv X-
superbimodules.

Proof. By (4.6) and Lemma 4.7, we have an Inv X-bimodule homomorphism

ι : (Inv X)∗ = Sym(X ∗) ֒→ ′Sym(X ∗) κ−→ Inv(X ∗).

(4.21)

As

Sym(X ∗

K) ∼= Sym(X ∗) ⊗O K ∼= ′Sym(X ∗) ⊗O K ∼= ′Sym(X ∗

K),

extending scalars in (4.21), we get an Inv XK-superbimodule isomorphism

ιK : (Inv XK)∗ = Sym(X ∗

K) = ′Sym(X ∗
K)
Considering ′Sym(X ∗) as the sublattice in Sym(X ∗
K), the restriction ιK|′Sym(X ∗) is
the isomorphism κ : ′Sym(X ∗) ∼−→ Inv(X ∗). Now the standard left and right
actions of Inv X ⊆ Inv XK on Inv(X ∗

invariant, and we have ι−1

Lemma 4.22. We have

∇K(′Sym(X ∗)) ⊆(cid:0) Sym(X ∗) ⊗ ′Sym(X ∗)(cid:1) ∩(cid:0)′Sym(X ∗) ⊗ Sym(X ∗)(cid:1).
(4.19). We can write ∇K(x) = Pm

Proof. Let x ∈ ′Symd(X ∗) for some d ∈ Z≥0. Let {ξ1, . . . , ξm} be a homogeneous
basis of Invd X and {x1, . . . , xm} be the dual basis of (Invd X)∗ = Symd(X ∗),

j = 1, . . . , m. By Lemma 4.20, ′Sym(X ∗) is invariant under the left dual regular
action of Inv X, so ξi · x ∈ ′Symd(X ∗) for any i ∈ {1, . . . , m}. On the other hand,
by (3.18),

ξi · x =

whence yi ∈ ′Symd(X ∗). We have proved that ∇K(′Sym(X)) ⊆ (cid:0)′Sym(X ∗) ⊗
Sym(X ∗)(cid:1). The other inclusion is proved similarly.

By Lemma 4.22, we have a coproduct

(cid:3)

∇ : ′Sym(X ∗) → ′Sym(X ∗) ⊗ ′Sym(X ∗)

obtained by restricting ∇K. Recalling (4.19), note that

DX = Inv X ⊗ (Inv X)∗ = Inv X ⊗ Sym(X ∗)

is an O-form of DXK. We deﬁne a larger O-form

′DX := Inv X ⊗ ′Sym(X ∗),

(4.23)

(4.24)

which is closed under the multiplication (4.11) because ′Sym(X ∗) is invariant
under the left and right dual regular actions of Inv X by Lemma 4.20. The
product in ′DX is also given by the formula (4.12) where we use the coproduct

(4.23) on x and y. We have ′DX =Ld≥0
′DdX := Xe,f ≥0, e+f =d

′DdX, where

Inve X ⊗ ′Symf (X ∗).

We use the following notation for the summands on the right hand side above:

′De,f X := Inve X ⊗ ′Symf (X ∗).

(4.25)

The following result often allows one to reduce the study of DX to that of

Inv TX. Recall the isomorphism κ from Lemma 3.10.

Theorem 4.26. There is an isomorphism of O-superalgebras

mas 3.10 and 3.6. To see that it is an algebra homomorphism, we compute for

Example 4.27. Let O[z]d be the truncated polynomial algebra O[z]/(zd+1),
and ′O[z]d be the divided power truncated polynomial algebra deﬁned as the O-
subalgebra of K[z]/(zd+1) spanned by all z(e) with e = 0, . . . , d. If X is the trivial
algebra O, let y ∈ X ∗ be the function which sends 1 to 1. Then DdX ∼= O[z]d,
with 1⊗d−e ⊗ ye ∈ Invd−e X ⊗ Syme(X ∗) corresponding to ze, and ′DdX ∼= ′O[z]d,
with 1⊗d−e ⊗ y(e) ∈ Invd−e X ⊗ ′Syme(X ∗) corresponding to z(e).

4.4. A generating set for a Turner double. For any d ∈ Z≥0, deﬁne DdX ⊆
Invd TX to be the image of DdX under the isomorphism of Theorem 4.26, and

set DX := Ld≥0 DdX. Of course DdX is just an isomorphic copy of DdX,

considered as an explicit subalgebra of Invd TX . By (4.24) and Lemma 3.10, we
have

DdX =

In the rest of this subsection, we write 1 for the identity element 1X of X.

Theorem 4.30. For any d ∈ Z>0, the O-superalgebra DdX is generated by
Invd X¯0 and 1⊗(d−1) ∗ Y .
Proof. Let G be the subalgebra of DdX generated by Invd X¯0 and 1⊗(d−1) ∗ Y .
By Lemma 4.29, it suﬃces to show that Dd−e,eX := Invd−e(X¯0) ∗ Stare Y ⊆ G
for all e ∈ [0, d]. We will prove this by induction on e, the case e = 0 being clear.

Let 0 < e ≤ d and assume that Dd−f,f X ⊆ G for all f ∈ [0, e). Let x ∈ Y and

y ∈ Stare−1 Y . It follows from Lemma 4.2 that

(1⊗(d−1) ∗ x)(1⊗(d−e+1) ∗ y) ∈ 1⊗(d−e) ∗ x ∗ y +

So 1⊗(d−e) ∗ Stare Y ⊆ G.

For every f ∈ [0, d − e], write Dd−e−f,f,eX := 1⊗(d−e−f ) ∗ Invf (X¯0) ∗ Stare Y .
We claim that Dd−e−f,f,eX ⊆ G for all such f . If the claim is true, then Dd−e,eX =
D0,d−e,eX ⊆ G, which implies the lemma. We prove the claim by induction on f .
The base case f = 0 was established in the previous paragraph.

Given f ∈ (0, d − e] and assuming that our claim is true for smaller f , let

ξ ∈ Invf (X¯0) and z ∈ Stare Y . By Lemma 4.2, we have

(1⊗(d−f ) ∗ ξ)(1⊗(d−e) ∗ z) =

where supercommutativity of ∗ has been used for the last equality. Note that
ξ(1) ∈ Invb(X¯0) for some b ≤ f , so ξ(1)1⊗(d−e−a) = 0 if a < d − e − f . Moreover,
any term in the sum with a > d − e − f belongs to Da,d−e−a,eX and hence
to G by the inductive hypothesis. The remaining term is 1⊗(d−e−f ) ∗ ξ ∗ z, so
1⊗(d−e−f ) ∗ ξ ∗ z ∈ G, and we have proved our claim.
(cid:3)

Let W be an X¯0-bimodule. For any ξ ∈ X¯0, deﬁne ad(ξ) ∈ EndO(W ) by
ad(ξ)(w) := ξw − wξ for all w ∈ W . Further, for any r ∈ Z≥0, we deﬁne
adr(X¯0) ⊆ EndO(W ) as the O-span of all compositions ad(ξ1) ◦ · · · ◦ ad(ξr) for
ξ1, . . . , ξr ∈ X¯0. As usual, if F is a subset of EndO(W ) and U is a subset of W ,
we denote by F (U ) the O-span of the elements f (u) for all f ∈ F and u ∈ U .

Corollary 4.31. Let U be a subsuperspace of Y such thatPr≥0 adr(X¯0)(U ) = Y ,

and let d ∈ Z>0. Then the O-superalgebra DdX is generated by Invd(X¯0) and
1⊗(d−1) ∗ U .

Proof. If d = 1, the result is clear, so we assume that d ≥ 2. By Lemma 4.2, for
any ξ ∈ X¯0 and x ∈ Y , we have

(1⊗(d−1) ∗ ξ)(1⊗(d−1) ∗ x) = 1⊗(d−2) ∗ ξ ∗ x + 1⊗(d−1) ∗ (ξx),
(1⊗(d−1) ∗ x)(1⊗(d−1) ∗ ξ) = 1⊗(d−2) ∗ x ∗ ξ + 1⊗(d−1) ∗ (xξ).

Since ξ has degree ¯0, we have x ∗ ξ = ξ ∗ x, so

1⊗(d−1) ∗ (ad(ξ)(x)) = (1⊗(d−1) ∗ ξ)(1⊗(d−1) ∗ x) − (1⊗(d−1) ∗ x)(1⊗(d−1) ∗ ξ).

We have proved that if 1⊗(d−1) ∗ x belongs to the subalgebra G ⊆ DdX generated
by Invd(X¯0) and 1⊗(d−1) ∗ U , then 1⊗(d−1) ∗ (ad(ξ)(x)) ∈ G for all ξ ∈ X¯0. In view
of the hypothesis, this implies that 1⊗(d−1) ∗ Y ⊆ G, and the result now follows
by Theorem 4.30.

4.5. Gradings. By (4.11), the algebra DdX (resp. ′DdX) is Z≥0-graded with
the graded degree e component being Dd−e,eX (resp. ′Dd−e,eX) for e = 0, . . . , d.
We refer to this grading as the standard grading. In fact, it is a supergalgebra
grading, which means that it is an algebra grading and a supergrading in the
sense of Section 3. If a superalgebra has a superalgebra grading, we just say that
it is graded.

Assume now that the multiplication in X satisﬁes X¯1X¯1 = 0. Then X is a
Z-graded algebra with X 0 = X¯0, X 1 = X¯1 and X m = 0 for m 6= 0, 1. We will
always work with the grading on X ∗ which is the shift by 2 of the canonical
grading, i.e. deg ξ = 2 if ξ ∈ X ∗ satisﬁes ξ(X 1) = 0 and deg ξ = 1 if ξ ∈ X ∗
satisﬁes ξ(X 0) = 0. Now TX = X ⊕ X ∗ is also graded, and it is easy to see that
this is a superalgebra grading.

This yields Z≥0-gradings on Inv X, Sym(X ∗), ′Sym(X ∗) and Inv TX. Moreover,
we let (Inv X)∗ inherit the grading from Sym(X ∗) via the identiﬁcation (4.19).
So we have Z≥0-gradings on the O-superspaces DX = Inv X ⊗ (Inv X)∗ and
′DX = Inv X ⊗ ′Sym(X ∗), which we refer to as Turner’s gradings, cf. [Tu1,

Remark 156]. If Y = DX or ′DX with Turner’s grading, then Y¯0 =Lm even Y m
and Y¯1 =Lm odd Y m. In particular, Turner’s grading is a supergrading.

Lemma 4.32. Let the superalgebra X have the property that X¯1X¯1 = 0. Then,
for every d ∈ Z≥0, the superalgebras DdX and ′DdX are Z≥0-graded with re-
spect to Turner’s gradings. Moreover, the isomorphism of Theorem 4.26 is an
isomorphism of graded superalgebras.

Proof. It is easy to check that Inv X, Sym(X ∗), ′Sym(X ∗) are Z≥0-graded super-
algebras. Moreover, Inv(X ∗) is graded with respect to the ∗-product. Next, one
checks that both Sym(X ∗) and ′Sym(X ∗) are graded Inv X-bimodules. Finally,
the homomorphisms ∆ : Inv X → Inv X ⊗ Inv X and κ : ′Sym(X ∗) ∼−→ Inv(X ∗)
are homogeneous of degree zero. So the lemma follows from (4.11).
(cid:3)

4.6. Symmetricity of doubles. Let X be a k-superalgebra which is free of
ﬁnite rank as a k-module. The Turner double superalgebra DdX deﬁned in §4.2
is symmetric. To see this, we deﬁne the bilinear form on DdX via

(ξ ⊗ x, η ⊗ y) := hξ, yihx, ηi.

We give another description of the form (·, ·). Recall the standard grading on
DdX from §4.5. Let F ∈ (DdX)∗ be deﬁned by requiring that F is zero on all
standard graded components Dd−e,eX for 0 ≤ e < d, and F (1 ⊗ x) = x(1⊗d
X ) for
x ∈ (Invd X)∗.

Lemma 4.33. For any t, u ∈ DdX, we have (t, u) = F (tu).

Proof. We may assume that t = ξ ⊗ x and u = η ⊗ y, where ξ ∈ Invd−e X,
x ∈ (Inve X)∗, η ∈ Indd−f X and y ∈ (Invf X)∗ for some 0 ≤ e, f ≤ d. We may
further assume that e = d − f , for otherwise both sides of the equation in the
lemma are zero. Then, using (4.11), we have

F(cid:0)(ξ ⊗ x)(η ⊗ y)(cid:1) =X(−1)

= (−1)

¯ξ(1)(¯ξ(2)+¯η+¯x)+¯η(1) ¯xF(cid:0)ξ(2)η(1) ⊗ (x · η(2))(ξ(1) · y)(cid:1)

where we have used (3.16) for the last equality. It remains to note that we can
drop the sign since hx, ηi = 0 unless ¯x = ¯η.
(cid:3)

Note that over an arbitrary k, non-degeneracy of a bilinear form (·, ·) on a free
k-module V of a ﬁnite rank means that for every k-basis {v1, . . . , vm} of V there
is another basis {w1, . . . , wm} such that (va, wb) = δa,b. The following corollary
shows that DdX is a symmetric algebra.

Corollary 4.34.
symmetric and associative.

[Tu3, Theorem 1.1] The form (·, ·) on DdX is non-degenerate,

Proof. The non-degeneracy and symmetricity are clear, while the associativity
follows from Lemma 4.33.

5. Generalized Schur-Weyl duality

Throughout this section, A = A¯0 ⊕ A¯1 is a k-superalgebra with k-bases B¯0 of

A¯0, B¯1 of A¯1, and B = B¯0 ⊔ B¯1 of A. Fix d ∈ Z≥0 and n ∈ Z>0.

5.1. Wreath product superalgebras. We will consider super wreath products

(5.1)
with kSd concentrated in degree ¯0. We identify A⊗d and kSd with the subsu-
peralgebras A⊗d ⊗ 1Sd and 1⊗d
d , respectively. The multiplication
in W A

d is then uniquely determined by the additional requirement that

A ⊗ kSd of W A

d := A⊗d ⋊ kSd,

W A

g−1(x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xd)g = (x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xd)g

(5.2)

for g ∈ Sd and x1, . . . , xd ∈ A, see (3.4). Given x ∈ A and 1 ≤ c ≤ d, we denote

x[c] := 1A ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1A ⊗ x ⊗ 1A ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1A ∈ A⊗d,

with x in the cth position. The following lemma is obvious:

Lemma 5.3. Let A be a superalgebra and d ∈ Z≥0. Then the superalgebra W A
d
is generated by the elements {x[c] | x ∈ A, 1 ≤ c ≤ d} ⊔ Sd subject only to the
following relations:

x[c] · y[c] = xy[c]
x[b] · y[c] = (−1)¯x¯yy[c] · x[b]

g · h = gh

g · x[c] = x[gc] · g

(x, y ∈ A, 1 ≤ c ≤ d),

(x, y ∈ A, 1 ≤ b 6= c ≤ d),
(g, h ∈ Sd),
(g ∈ Sd, x ∈ A, 1 ≤ c ≤ d).

Let λ ∈ Λ(n, d). We always consider the group algebra kSλ of the standard
d . In particular, kSλ
d into a left kSλ-module, which

parabolic subgroup Sλ as a subalgebra kSλ ⊆ kSd ⊆ W A
acts naturally on the left on W A
is free with basis

d . This makes W A

{g(b1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ bd) | g ∈ λD, b1, . . . , bd ∈ B}.

So, denoting by trivλ the trivial right kSλ-module k · 1λ, we have the (right)
induced W A

d -module

M A

λ := trivλ ⊗kSλ W A
d

(5.4)

with generator mλ := 1λ ⊗ 1. We refer to M A

λ as a permutation module.

5.2. Tensor space. The matrix algebra Mn(A) is a superalgebra in its own right.
We use the elements

ξx
r,s := xEr,s ∈ Mn(A)

(x ∈ A, 1 ≤ r, s ≤ n)

(5.5)

as in §3.4. We also introduce the special notation

SA(n, d) := Invd(Mn(A))

and SA(n) := Inv(Mn(A)) =Md≥0

SA(n, d).

If A = k, the algebra SA(n, d) is nothing but the classical Schur algebra S(n, d)
as in [Gr].

Let V = A⊕n, considered as a right A-supermodule in the natural way. Note
that we have a natural isomorphism Mn(A) ∼−→ EndA(V ), where we consider V
as column vectors and the isomorphism sends a matrix ξ to the left multiplication
by ξ. This implies the isomorphism

Tensd Mn(A)

∼
−→ EndTensd A(Tensd V ).

(5.6)

Recall from (3.4) that Sd acts on Tensd V with k-linear maps, and write vg :=
vg for v ∈ V , g ∈ Sd. Thus we have right supermodule structures on Tensd V over
both kSd and Tensd A. In view of Lemma 5.3, the superspace Tensd V becomes
a right W A
d on Tensd V as the
standard permutation action.

d -supermodule. We refer to this right action of W A

Lemma 5.7. The natural embedding

SA(n, d) ֒→ Tensd Mn(A)

∼
−→ EndTensd A(Tensd V )

deﬁnes an isomorphism of superalgebras

SA(n, d) ∼= EndW A

d

(Tensd V ).

Proof. The action of Sd on Tensd V yields the action on EndTensd A(Tensd V ) via
(ϕ · g)(v) = ϕ(vg−1)g for ϕ ∈ EndTensd A(Tensd V ), g ∈ Sd and v ∈ Tensd V .

Let α : Tensd Mn(A)

∼
−→ EndTensd A(Tensd V ) be the isomorphism (5.6). We
have the Sd-action on EndTensd A(Tensd V ) deﬁned in the previous paragraph, and
the Sd-action on Tensd Mn(A) deﬁned by (3.4). It is easy to see that α intertwines
the two actions. Taking invariants, we get an isomorphism between SA(n, d) =
(Tensd Mn(A))Sd and EndW A
(cid:3)

(Tensd V ) = (EndTensd A(Tensd V ))Sd.

d

For 1 ≤ r ≤ n, we set

vr := (0, . . . , 0, 1A, 0, . . . , 0) ∈ V,

(5.8)

where 1A is in the rth position. For r = (r1, . . . , rd) ∈ Seq(n, d), we deﬁne

vr := vr1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vrd ∈ Tensd V.

Since {v1, . . . , vn} is an A-basis of V , the set {vr | r ∈ Seq(n, d)} is a Tensd A-
basis of Tensd V . Note that

vrg = vrg

(g ∈ Sd, r ∈ Seq(n, d)).

(5.9)

Let λ ∈ Λ(n, d). We denote by Tensλ V the Tensd A-span of all vr such that
d -submodule of Tensd V . We have
r ∈ λSeq, cf. (2.1). By (5.9), Tensλ V is a W A
a special vector

We have the decomposition of W A

Lemma 5.11. Let λ ∈ Λ(n, d). There is an isomorphism of right W A
λ which maps vλ to the standard generator mλ of M A
Tensλ V

∼

d -modules

Proof. It is immediate that vλ is Sλ-invariant, which yields a homomorphism
λ → Tensλ V, mλ 7→ vλ. This is an isomorphism, since it maps the Tensd A-
M A
λ to the Tensd A-basis {vr | r ∈ λSeq} of Tensλ V , cf.
basis {mλg | g ∈ λD} of M A
the bijection (2.6).

(cid:3)

For any λ ∈ Λ(n, d), we deﬁne
ξλ := E⊗λ1

1,1 ∗ · · · ∗ E⊗λn

n,n ∈ SA(n, d).

(5.12)

Lemma 5.13. Let λ, µ ∈ Λ(n, d). Then:

(i) ξλξµ = δλ,µξλ and Pν∈Λ(n,d) ξν = 1.

(ii) ξλ Tensd V = Tensλ V .

Proof. Note that ξλvµ = δλ,µvλ. But vλ generates Tensλ V as a right W A
d -module
by Lemma 5.11, and the action of SA(n, d) on Tensd V commutes with that of W A
d

by Lemma 5.7, so ξλ acts as the projection onto Tensλ V along Lν6=λ Tensν V .

The lemma follows since SA(n, d) acts on Tensd V faithfully thanks to Lemma 5.7.
(cid:3)

5.3. Idempotent truncation. Throughout the subsection we assume that d ≤
n and set

ω := ε1 + · · · + εd ∈ Λ(n, d).

(5.14)
The main goal of this subsection is to explicitly identify ξωSA(n, d)ξω with W A
d
and SA(n, d)ξω with Tensd V so that the natural right action of ξωSA(n, d)ξω on
d on Tensd V , cf. [Gr,
SA(n, d)ξω becomes the standard permutation action of W A

which maps s ∈ ξωSA(n, d)ξω to the left multiplication by s. On the other hand,
d -supermodules ξω Tensd V =
by Lemma 5.11, there is an isomorphism of right W A
Tensω V ∼−→ M A
ω is free of rank 1 with

Note that SA(n, d)ξω is a right ξωSA(n, d)ξω-module, so we consider it as a
d with ξωSA(n, d)ξω coming from

right W A
the isomorphism ϕ of Lemma 5.15.
Proposition 5.17. There is a unique isomorphism SA(n, d)ξω
(SA(n, d), W A
Proof. Since ξωvω = vω, there is a unique homomorphism ψ of left SA(n, d)-
modules SA(n, d)ξω → Tensd V mapping ξω to vω. Using Lemma 5.15, we com-
pute for any s ∈ SA(n, d) and any w ∈ W A

ψ((sξω)w) = ψ((sξω)ϕ(w)) = ψ(sξωϕ(w)) = ψ(sϕ(w)ξω )

= sϕ(w)vω = svωw = sξωvωw = ψ(sξω)w,

so ψ is a homomorphism of (SA(n, d), W A

d )-superbimodules.

Moreover, ψ is injective since ψ(sξω) = 0 only if sξωvω = 0, which implies
d = Tensω V . On the other hand, by
that sξω Tensω V = 0 because vωW A
Lemma 5.13(ii), we have sξω Tensµ V = 0 for all µ 6= ω, hence sξω Tensd V = 0,
so sξω = 0.

Finally, for every µ ∈ Λ(n, d) there is a homomorphism of right W A
µ , mω 7→ mµ, and so there is a homomorphism of right W A
ω → M A

Tensω V → Tensµ V, vω 7→ vµ, see Lemma 5.11. By Lemma 5.7, there is s ∈
SA(n, d) with svω = vµ. As vµ generates Tensµ V as a W A
d -module for every
µ ∈ Λ(n, d), we now deduce that vω generates Tensd V as an (SA(n, d), W A
d )-
bimodule. Hence ψ is surjective.

Denote the center of an algebra Y by Z(Y ). Recall from Section 3 the notation
|X| for a superalgebra X. The following technical result, in which we forget the
superstructures, will be needed in §6.2:

Lemma 5.18. Let d ≤ n. If z ∈ Z(|SA(n, d)|) and ξω ∈ |SA(n, d)|z, then z is
invertible.

Proof. Let S := |SA(n, d)| and W := |W A

d |. First, note that ξλzξµ = zξλξµ = 0

for any distinct λ, µ ∈ Λ(n, d). So z =Pλ∈Λ(n,d) zλ, where zλ := zξλ = ξλz.

Let λ ∈ Λ(n, d). There is a unique W -module homomorphism sending mω to
mλ, so by Lemmas 5.7 and 5.11, there exists a unique element ξλ,ω ∈ ξλSξω such
that ξλ,ωvω = vλ.

By the hypothesis, there exists yω ∈ S such that yωz = ξω. Replacing yω with
ξωyωξω, we may (and do) assume that yω ∈ ξωSξω, and then it is easy to see
that yω ∈ Z(ξωSξω). Let ˜yω ∈ W be the image of yω under the isomorphism
∼
−→ W of Lemma 5.15. Then ˜yω ∈ Z(W ) and yωvω = vω ˜yω. For any
ξωSξω
g ∈ Sλ, we have mλ ˜yωg = mλg ˜yω = mλ ˜yω. Hence, there is a right W -module
endomorphism of Mλ sending mλ to mλ ˜yω. By Lemmas 5.7 and 5.11, this implies
that there exists yλ ∈ ξλSξλ such that yλvλ = vλ ˜yω. Therefore,

zλyλvλ = zλvλ ˜yω = zλξλ,ωvω ˜yω = zλξλ,ωyωvω = zξλ,ωyωvω = ξλ,ωzyωvω

= ξλ,ωξωvω = ξλ,ωvω = vλ.

By Lemma 5.7, it follows that zλyλ = ξλ. Setting y := Pλ∈Λ(n,d) yλ, we have

zy = 1.

5.5. Desuperization. Recall from Section 3 that |X| denotes the algebra ob-

symmetric group acts on |A|⊗d by place permutations without signs. On the
other hand, we can consider the associative algebra |W A
In general, the al-

d and |W A

Let e¯0 and e¯1 be orthogonal idempotents in A with 1 := 1A = e¯0 + e¯1. We call
such a pair of idempotents adapted if A¯0 = e¯0Ae¯0⊕e¯1Ae¯1 and A¯1 = e¯0Ae¯1⊕e¯1Ae¯0.
Let 1 ≤ r < d. We denote the elementary transposition (r, r + 1) ∈ Sd by τr. If
in addition ε1, ε2 ∈ Z2, we set

d

eε1,ε2[r] := eε1[r]eε2[r + 1] = 1⊗r−1 ⊗ eε1 ⊗ eε2 ⊗ 1⊗d−r−1 ∈ A⊗d.

τr 7→ τr(e¯0,¯0[r] + e¯0,¯1[r] + e¯1,¯0[r] − e¯1,¯1[r]).

Proof. It is straightforward to check for all admissible r, t, x, y that the elements
σ(τ1), . . . , σ(τd−1) satisfy the Coxeter relations, that σ(x[t])σ(y[t]) = σ(xy[t]),
and that σ(τr)σ(x[t]) = σ(x[t])σ(τr) if t 6= r, r + 1.

Let 1 ≤ s < t ≤ d. Then σ(x[t])σ(y[s]) equals

In view of Lemma 5.3, we have an algebra homomorphism σ as in the statement
of the lemma. Moreover, it is easy to see that for each g ∈ Sd, the map σ restricts
to an automorphism of the k-submodule A⊗d⊗g, whence σ is an isomorphism. (cid:3)

Let again (e¯0, e¯1) be an adapted pair of idempotents in A. Assume in addition
that we are given two ﬁnite families of non-zero orthogonal idempotents {ei | i ∈

Remark 5.35. If the superalgebra A is graded, the theory of this section goes
through, yielding gradings on SA(n, d) and W A
d , as well as all the modules over
them that were considered. To be more precise, Mn(A) inherits a grading from
A, and then so do Tens Mn(A) and Inv Mn(A). On the other hand, W A
d =
A⊗d ⊗ kSd is graded with kSd in degree 0. In particular, the isomorphism ψ
from Corollary 5.34 is an isomorphism of graded algebras.

6. Schur doubles

Let d ∈ Z>0 and n ∈ Z≥0. For an O-superalgebra A which is free of ﬁnite rank

as an O-supermodule, we denote

′DA(n, d) := ′DdMn(A)

and DA(n, d) := DdMn(A).

The main result of this section is Theorem 6.6, which roughly speaking asserts
that DA(n, d) is a maximal symmetric subalgebra of ′DA(n, d). But ﬁrst, we
develop the results of §4.4 on generation in this set-up.

6.1. Generating DA(n, d). Let TA = A ⊕ A∗ be the trivial extension superal-
gebra of A, cf. §3.4. In view of Lemma 3.21, we identify Mn(TA) with TMn(A)
so that ξ(a,α)
s,r) ∈ TMn(A) for all 1 ≤ r, s ≤ n,
a ∈ A and α ∈ A∗, where xα

r,s ∈ Mn(A)∗ is the element deﬁned in (3.20).

r,s ∈ Mn(TA) corresponds to (ξa

r,s, xα

We also identify ′DA(n, d) = ′DdMn(A) with Invd TMn(A) via the explicit iso-
morphism of Theorem 4.26. Combining this with the identiﬁcation TMn(A) =
Mn(TA) from the previous paragraph, we now can and do identify ′DA(n, d) with
Invd Mn(TA) = STA(n, d). Since DA(n, d) is a subsuperalgebra of ′DA(n, d), we
now identify it as a subsuperalgebra of STA(n, d). As A¯0 is a subalgebra of TA,
the algebra SA¯0(n, d) = Invd Mn(A¯0) is also a subalgebra of the superalgebra
STA(n, d) = Invd Mn(TA) in the natural way.

Theorem 6.1. The subsuperalgebra DA(n, d) ⊆ STA(n, d) is precisely the subal-
gebra generated by SA¯0(n, d) and the set {ξy

1,1 ∗ 1⊗(d−1) | y ∈ TA} ⊆ STA(n, d).

Proof. This follows from Corollary 4.31. Indeed, we consider that corollary with
Mn(A) in place of X. Then, taking into account the identiﬁcations made in
this subsection, Invd(A¯0) in Corollary 4.31 corresponds to SA¯0(n, d), and Y in
Corollary 4.31 corresponds to Mn(A¯1 ⊕ A∗). It remains to take U := {ξy
1,1 | y ∈
A¯1 ⊕ A∗}, which is easily seen to satisfy the assumptions of Corollary 4.31. (cid:3)
Corollary 6.2. Let A and A′ be O-superalgebras which are free of ﬁnite rank as
∼
−→ TA′ which restricts to an
O-supermodules. If we have an isomorphism ϕ : TA
¯0, then the isomorphism STA(n, d) ∼−→ STA′ (n, d) induced
isomorphism A¯0
by ϕ restricts to an isomorphism DA(n, d) ∼−→ DA′

∼−→ A′

(n, d).

If A¯1A¯1 = 0, then Mn(A)¯1Mn(A)¯1 = 0, and so we have Turner’s grading on

DA(n, d), cf. Lemma 4.32.

Corollary 6.3. If A¯1A¯1 = 0, then DA(n, d) is generated by the elements of
degrees 0, 1 and 2 with respect to Turner’s grading.

By Theorem 6.1, this shows that D ⊆ DA(n, d). For the reverse inclusion, it

For every λ ∈ Λ(n, d), the idempotent ξλ ∈ STA(n, d) deﬁned in (5.12) belongs
to SA¯0(n, d), and so, by Corollary 6.4, to DA(n, d) ⊆ STA(n, d). The following is
known, cf. [Tu2, Lemma 13]:

Indeed, the case g = 1 is handled using
Lemma 4.3 and Corollary 6.4, and the case x1 = · · · = xd = 1 is clear since
ξ(1, . . . , 1; g) ∈ SA¯0(n, d). By Lemma 5.15, the elements ξ(x1, . . . , xd; g) span in

the elements ξ(1, . . . , 1; g) spanning kSd. The claim follows.

6.2. Symmetric lattices in ′DA(n, d). In this subsection, in addition to the
hypotheses speciﬁed at the beginning of Section 2, we assume that O is a principal
ideal domain. Let A be an O-superalgebra which is free of ﬁnite rank as an O-
supermodule. The following result shows, in particular, that DA(n, d) is maximal
among the symmetric subalgebras of ′DA(n, d). The superstructure on ′DA(n, d)
plays no role in the theorem, so the content of the statement does not change if
′DA(n, d) is replaced by |′DA(n, d)| and DA(n, d) by |DA(n, d)|.

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

Theorem 6.6. Let d ∈ Z≥0, n ∈ Z>0, and assume that d ≤ n. Let C be an
O-subalgebra of ′DA(n, d) such that DA(n, d) ⊆ C ⊆ ′DA(n, d). Suppose that for
every maximal ideal m of O the (O/m)-algebra C ⊗O (O/m) is symmetric. Then
C = DA(n, d).

Proof. If the theorem is true in the case where O is a discrete valuation ring
(DVR), then it is true in general. Indeed, for every maximal ideal m of O the
localisation Om is a DVR, and so by the DVR case of the theorem, C ⊗O Om is
equal to the Om-span of DA(n, d) ⊗ 1Om. Then we have (C/DA(n, d)) ⊗O Om = 0
for all m, whence the O-module C/DA(n, d) is 0.

In the rest of the proof, O is a DVR with the maximal ideal (π) for some
π ∈ O, and k := O/(π). For any free O-module V of ﬁnite rank, we have the
k-vector space Vk = V ⊗O k, which we identify with V /πV .

Recall the notation (4.14) and (4.25). In this proof, for all e = 0, . . . , d, we use

the following shorthands:

D := DA(n, d),

′D := ′DA(n, d), S := SA(n, d),

Dd−e,e := Dd−e,eMn(A) = Invd−e Mn(A) ⊗ Syme(Mn(A)∗) ⊆ D,
′Dd−e,e := ′Dd−e,eMn(A) = Invd−e Mn(A) ⊗ ′Syme(Mn(A)∗) ⊆ ′D,

′D>e := Me+1≤f ≤d

′Dd−f,f , C d−e,e := C ∩ ′Dd−e,e, C >e := C ∩ ′D>e.

Claim 1. The O-submodule C d−e,e is pure in C.
This follows immediately from the fact that ′Dd−e,e is pure in ′D.
Claim 2. We have C d,0 = Dd,0 = ′Dd,0 and C = C d,0 ⊕ C >0.
Since ′Dd,0 = Dd,0 by deﬁnition, the assumption D ⊆ C ⊆ ′D implies that
C d,0 = Dd,0. The second assertion of the claim follows easily from the ﬁrst one.
Claim 3. We have dim C d,0
Indeed,

k = dim C 0,d
k .

dim C d,0

k = rankO C d,0 = rankO Dd,0 = rankO D0,d = rankO C 0,d = dim C 0,d
k ,

where the penultimate equality comes from D0,d ⊆ C 0,d ⊆ ′D0,d.

Since ′D0,d is an ideal in ′D and C ⊆ ′D is a subalgebra, C 0,d is an ideal in

Since Ck is symmetric by assumption, there is a function G ∈ C ∗

bilinear form on Ck deﬁned by (x, y) := G(xy) is symmetric and non-degenerate.
By Claims 1 and 2, we can naturally identify C 0,d
k with k-subspaces
of Ck. Using the standard grading on ′D, we see that the orthogonal complement

that (·, ·) restricts to a perfect pairing between C 0,d

In view of Remark 4.16, we identify Dd,0 with S and D0,d with S∗, so that
S∗ ⊆ C 0,d ⊆ ′D0,d. Extending scalars to the ﬁeld of fractions K of O, we identify
K = C 0,d
K , and so we can consider C 0,d and ′D0,d as O-submodules of
S∗
S∗
K. Now, deﬁne

K = ′D0,d

′S = {x ∈ SK | hx, ′D0,di ⊆ O}

and N = {x ∈ SK | hx, C 0,di ⊆ O}.

Then ′S ⊆ N ⊆ S. The following claim follows easily from the deﬁnitions:
Claim 5. We have that ′S and N are S-subbimodules of S, and there are isomor-
phisms of S-bimodules ′S ∼= (′D0,d)∗ and N ∼= (C 0,d)∗.
Claim 6. We have ξω ∈ ′S.
By Corollary 3.15, we have ′S = Stard Mn(A), and the claim follows from the
deﬁnition of ξω.

∼= (C 0,d

Claim 7. We have N = S.
By Claims 2, 4 and 5, we have isomorphisms Sk = C d,0
k )∗ ∼= Nk of
k
Sk-bimodules. Let z + πN ∈ N/πN = Nk be the image of 1 ∈ Sk under this
isomorphism. Then x(z + πN ) = (z + πN )x for all x ∈ Sk. Since πS ⊇ πN , it
follows that z + πS ∈ Z(S/πS) = Z(Sk). Since Sk is generated by 1 as a left
Sk-module, Nk is generated by z + πN as a left Sk-module. Moreover, ξω ∈ ′S by
Claim 6, so ξω ∈ N . Hence there exists y ∈ Sk such that y(z + πN ) = ξω + πN ,
whence y(z + πS) = ξω + πS. By Lemma 5.18, z + πS is invertible in Sk. So
N + πS = Sk(z + πS)Sk = Sk. By Nakayama’s Lemma, this implies that N = S.
Now we complete the proof of the theorem. By Claim 7, we have C 0,d = D0,d.
Assume for a contradiction that C 6= D. Choose an element x ∈ C \ D such that
x lies in ′D>e−1 with e maximal possible. Then we can write x = xe + · · · + xd,
where xf ∈ ′Dd−f,f for f = e, . . . , d. By the maximality of e, we have xe /∈ Dd−e,e.
Hence xe = cy for some c ∈ K \ O and y ∈ Dd−e,e \ πDd−e,e.

Let F ∈ (Dk)∗ be as in Lemma 4.33. Taking into account Corollary 4.34 and
the standard grading on D, we conclude that there exists u ∈ De,d−e such that
F (yu+πD) 6= 0 in k, whence yu /∈ πD0,d. By the standard grading again, xf u = 0
for all f > e, and hence xu = cyu. Since c /∈ O, it follows that xu /∈ D0,d = C 0,d.
This is a contradiction, since x ∈ C and u ∈ De,d−e ⊆ C.
(cid:3)

Example 6.7. Continuing with Example 4.27, assume that d = 2e + 1 for some
e ∈ Z>0, and deﬁne the Z-algebra C to be the subalgebra of Q[z]d spanned over
Z by the elements 1, z, . . . , ze, ze+1/2, . . . , z2e+1/2. We then have DdZ ∼= Z[z]d (
∼= ′DdZ. However, it is easy to see that C ⊗Z Fp is symmetric for all
C ( ′Z[z]d
primes p. This shows that the assumption d ≤ n in Theorem 6.6 is essential.

6.3. Bases and product rules. Let B¯0 be an O-basis of A¯0, B¯1 be an O-basis
of A¯1, and B = B¯0 ⊔ B¯1. The structure constants κb
b′b′′ ∈ O of A are determined
from

We ﬁx a total order < on the basis (6.8) as follows. First, we ﬁx a total order <
on B so that the elements of B¯0 precede the elements of B¯1. Then for b′, b′′ ∈ B
and 1 ≤ r, s, t, u ≤ n, we set ξb′

(1) b′ < b′′, (2) b′ = b′′ and r < t, (3) b′ = b′′, r = t and s < u.

r,s < ξb′′

Recall the notation of §2.2. For C = (C b)b∈B ∈ MB(n), we have the element

where the ∗-product is taken in the order just deﬁned. This agrees with (3.9), so

r,s(cid:1) ∈ SA(n),

¯ξC = ¯C := |C|¯1 (mod 2).

where the sum is over all triples (b′, t, b′′) ∈ Bd × Seq(n, d) × Bd such that

is Green’s formula [Gr, (2.3b)] for the structure constants of the Schur algebra.
Let {xC | C ∈ MB(n)} be the basis of SA(n)∗ = (Inv Mn(A))∗ dual to the
basis {ξC | C ∈ MB(n)} of SA(n). As the product and the coproduct on SA(n)∗

7. The quiver case

In this section we consider an important class of algebras DA(n, d) sometimes

referred to as schiver doubles, from ‘schiver=Schur+quiver’ [Tu1].

7.1. Quivers and quiver algebras. Let Q be a quiver with a ﬁnite set of
vertices I = {1, . . . , l} and a ﬁnite set of directed edges E. For an edge β ∈ E, we
denote by s(β) ∈ I the source of β and by t(β) ∈ I the target of β. We denote by
Γ the underlying graph of Q. We assume that Γ is connected and has no loops or
multiple edges. If i, j ∈ I, we say that i and j are neighbors if they are connected
by an edge in Γ.

We deﬁne the algebra PQ to be the quotient of the path algebra kQ by all
quadratic relations. We consider PQ as a superalgebra with vertices in parity ¯0
and edges in parity ¯1. The parity ¯0 component PQ,¯0 has a basis {ei | i ∈ I}, and
the parity ¯1 component PQ,¯1 has a basis {β | β ∈ E}. Note that PQ,¯1PQ,¯1 = 0,
so PQ is also Z-graded with the degree 0 component P 0
Q = PQ,¯0 and degree 1
component P 1

Q = PQ,¯1.

Let {e∗

i , β∗ | i ∈ I, β ∈ E} be the basis of P ∗

Q dual to the basis {ei, β | i ∈ I, β ∈
E} of PQ. According to the agreement made in §4.5, we always work with the
Z-grading on P ∗
i = 2
and deg β∗ = 1 for all i ∈ I and β ∈ E. Then the trivial extension superalgebra
TPQ = PQ ⊕ P ∗
Q is also graded. This superalgebra has an easy description as a
zigzag algebra, which we introduce next.

Q which is the shift by 2 of the canonical grading, i.e. deg e∗

The zigzag algebra Z = ZΓ of type Γ is deﬁned in [HK] as follows. First assume
that l > 1. Let Γ be the quiver obtained by doubling all edges in Γ and then
orienting the edges so that if i and j are neighboring vertices in Γ, then there is
a directed edge ai,j from j to i and a directed edge aj,i from i to j. Then Z is the
path algebra kΓ, generated by length 0 paths ei for i ∈ I and length 1 paths ai,j,
subject only to the following relations:

(i) All paths of length three or greater are zero.
(ii) All paths of length two that are not cycles are zero.
(iii) All length-two cycles based at the same vertex are equal.

The algebra Z inherits the path length grading from kΓ. If l = 1, i.e. Γ is of type
A1, we deﬁne ZA1 := k[c]/(c2), where c is an indeterminate in degree 2.

If l > 1, for every vertex i pick its neighbor j and denote c(i) := ai,j aj,i. The
relations in Z imply that c(i) = eic(i)ei is independent of choice of j. Deﬁne

TURNER DOUBLES AND GENERALIZED SCHUR ALGEBRAS

c(i). Then in all cases Z has a basis

{ai,j | i, j ∈ I, j is a neighbor of i} ∪ {cmei | i ∈ I, m ∈ {0, 1}},

c :=Pi∈V

and the graded k-rank of Z equals l(1 + q2) + 2|E|q ∈ Z[q], where q is an inde-
terminate. Moreover, we consider Z as a superalgebra with Z¯0 = Z0 ⊕ Z2 and
Z¯1 = Z1.

The following is known [Tu2, Lemma 6] and easy to check:

Lemma 7.1. There is an isomorphism of graded superalgebras TPQ
by ei 7→ ei, e∗

i 7→ c(i), β 7→ ai,j, β∗ 7→ aj,i if s(β) = j and t(β) = i.

∼

−→ Z given

7.2. Schiver doubles. From now on we will work over O. For a quiver Q as in
the previous subsection, we deﬁne

DQ(n, d) := DPQ(n, d),

′DQ(n, d) := ′DPQ(n, d).

In view of Lemma 7.1, we identify TPQ with Z, and so, as in §6.1, we identify
′DQ(n, d) with STPQ (n, d) = S Z(n, d).
In this way, we identify DQ(n, d) with
a subalgebra of S Z(n, d). By Corollary 6.2, the superalgebra DQ(n, d) does not
depend on the choice of orientation on Q, cf. [Tu1, Theorem 157]. As PQ,¯1PQ,¯1 =
0, we have Turner’s gradings on DQ(n, d) and ′DQ(n, d), see §4.5. We also have
a grading on S Z(n, d), see Remark 5.35. All our identiﬁcations respect gradings.
i=1 Oei ∼= O⊕l. Recall

Note that the degree zero component of PQ is P 0

that S(n, d) = SO(n, d) is the classical Schur algebra. By Corollary 4.4,

Q =Pl

SP 0

Q(n, d) ∼= M(d1,...,dl)∈Λ(l,d)

Q = Z0, we have Mn(P 0

Proof. As P 0

Q) = Mn(Z)0, which implies the lemma.

Q(n, d) → S Z(n, d) is exactly

Theorem 7.4. Let n ≥ d. Then the subsuperalgebra DQ(n, d) ⊆ S Z(n, d) is
precisely the subalgebra generated by S Z(n, d)0 and the set

n,n | z ∈ Z, (λ2, . . . , λn) ∈ Λ(n − 1, d − 1)} ⊆ S Z(n, d).

Proof. In view of Lemma 7.3, this is a restatement of Corollary 6.4.

Note that DQ(n, d), ′DQ(n, d) and S Z(n, d) are graded superalgebras, whose
constructions depend on the superalgebra structures on PQ and Z. However, after
we construct them, we want to forget the superalgebra structures and work with
DQ(n, d) and S Z(n, d) as usual graded algebras. In order to do that, recall the
theory of §5.5. From now on, we assume that Γ has no odd cycles. Then to every
vertex i ∈ I, we can assign a sign ζi ∈ {±1} such that ζiζj = −1 whenever i and
j are neighbors. Let

e

¯0 = Xi∈I, ζi=1

ei

and e

¯1 = Xi∈I, ζi=−1

ei.

One can easily check that (e¯0, e¯1) is an adapted pair of idempotents for the
superalgebra Z in the sense of §5.5.

The following is easy to see:

Lemma 7.6. For any λ ∈ Λ([1, n − 1] × I, d − 1), the map iλ is an injective
homomorphism of graded algebras.

By Corollary 5.34 and Remark 5.35, there is an explicit isomorphism of graded

We use this isomorphism to identify the graded algebra |′DQ(n, d)| = |S Z(n, d)|

Proof. Let λ = (λ1, . . . , λn−1) ∈ Λ(n − 1, d − 1) and z ∈ ej Zek for some j, k ∈ I.
We claim that

iλ(z),

which implies the result by Theorem 7.4. To prove the claim, let ν ∈ Λ([1, n] ×
)vν = 0 unless ν is of the form ˆµk for
I, d). Note that (ξz
some µ ∈ π−1(λ) and k ∈ I. Moreover, for µ ∈ π−1(λ), we have

where z[1] = z ⊗ 1⊗d−1 is viewed as an element of W Z
and (5.33), we deduce that

iλ(z)(m|Z|

= Xλ∈π−1(λ)

where we have used the fact that σ−1(z[1]) = z[1], see Lemma 5.27. The claim is
proved.
