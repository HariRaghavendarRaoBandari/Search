Abstract

It is well-known that the graphs not containing a given graph H as a sub-
graph have bounded chromatic number if and only if H is acyclic. Here we
consider ordered graphs, i.e., graphs with a linear ordering ≺ on their vertex
set, and the function

f≺(H) = sup{χ(G) | G ∈ Forb≺(H)},

where Forb≺(H) denotes the set of all ordered graphs that do not contain a
copy of H.
If H contains a cycle, then as in the case of unordered graphs, f≺(H) = ∞.
However, in contrast to the unordered graphs, we describe an inﬁnite family of
ordered forests H with f≺(H) = ∞. An ordered graph is crossing if there are
two edges uv and u(cid:48)v(cid:48) with u ≺ u(cid:48) ≺ v ≺ v(cid:48). For connected crossing ordered
graphs H we reduce the problem of determining whether f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞ to a family
of so-called monotonically alternating trees. For non-crossing H we prove that
f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞ if and only if H is acyclic and does not contain a copy of any of the
ﬁve special ordered forests on four or ﬁve vertices, which we call bonnets. For
such forests H, we show that f≺(H) (cid:54) 2|V (H)| and that f≺(H) (cid:54) 2|V (H)| − 3

if H is connected.

Keywords: ordered graphs, chromatic number, forbidden subgraphs

1 Introduction

What conclusions can one make about the chromatic number of a graph knowing
that it does not contain certain subgraphs? Let H be a graph on at least two
vertices, Forb(H) be the set of all graphs not containing H as a subgraph, and
f (H) = sup{χ(G) | G ∈ Forb(H)}. If H has a cycle of length (cid:96), then for any integer
χ there is a graph G of girth at least (cid:96)+1 and chromatic number χ, see [11], implying
that f (H) = ∞. On the other hand, if H is a forest on k vertices and G is a graph of
chromatic number at least k, then G contains a k-critical subgraph G(cid:48), that in turn

1

has minimum degree at least k − 1. Thus a copy of H can be found as a subgraph
of G(cid:48) by a greedy embedding. Therefore G (cid:54)∈ Forb(H), implying that f (H) (cid:54) k − 1.
So, we see that f (H) is ﬁnite if and only if H is acyclic.

A similar situation holds for directed graphs, with a similarly deﬁned function
fdir(H) being ﬁnite if and only if the underlying graph of H is acyclic. A result of

Addalirio-Berry et al. [1], see also [4], implies that fdir(H) (cid:54) k2/2−k/2−1 whenever

H is a directed k-vertex graph whose underlying graph is acyclic.

Here, we consider the behavior of the chromatic number of ordered graphs with
forbidden ordered subgraphs. An ordered graph G is a graph (V, E) together with a
linear ordering ≺ of its vertex set V . An ordered subgraph H of an ordered graph G
is a subgraph of the (unordered) graph (V, E) together with the linear ordering of
its vertices inherited from G. An ordered subgraph H is a copy of an ordered graph
H(cid:48) if there is an order preserving isomorphism between H and H(cid:48). For an ordered
graph H on at least two vertices1 let Forb≺(H) denote the set of all ordered graphs
that do not contain a copy of H. We consider the function f≺ given by

f≺(H) = sup{χ(G) | G ∈ Forb≺(H)}.

We show that it is no longer true that f≺(H) is ﬁnite if and only if H is acyclic.
When H is connected, we reduce the problem of determining whether f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞
to a well behaved class of trees, which we call monotonically alternating trees. We
completely classify so-called “non-crossing” ordered graphs H for which f≺(H) = ∞.
In case of “non-crossing” H with ﬁnite f≺(H), we provide speciﬁc upper bounds
on this function in terms of the number of vertices in H. Note that f≺(H) (cid:62)
|V (H)| − 1 for any ordered graph H, since a complete graph on |V (H)| − 1 vertices
is in Forb≺(H).

We need some formal deﬁnitions before stating the main results of the paper. We
consider the vertices of an ordered graph laid out along a horizontal line according to
their ordering ≺ and say that for u ≺ v the vertex u is to the left of v and the vertex
v is to the right of u. We write u (cid:22) v if u ≺ v or u = v. For two sets of vertices U
and U(cid:48) we write U ≺ U(cid:48) if all vertices in U are left of all vertices in U(cid:48). Two edges
uv and u(cid:48)v(cid:48) cross if u ≺ u(cid:48)
≺ v ≺ v(cid:48) and an ordered graph H is called crossing if it

contains two crossing edges. Otherwise, H is called non-crossing. Two distinct or-
dered graphs G and H cross each other if there is an edge in G crossing an edge in H.

An ordered graph is a bonnet if it has 4 or 5 vertices u1 ≺ u2 (cid:22) u3 ≺ u4 (cid:22) u5
and edges u1u2, u1u5, u3u4, or if it has vertices u1 (cid:22) u2 ≺ u3 (cid:22) u4 ≺ u5 and edges
u1u5, u4u5, u2u3. See Figure 1 (ﬁrst two rows). An ordered path P = u1, . . . , un is
a tangled path if for a vertex ui, 1 < i < n, that is either leftmost or rightmost
in P there is an edge in the subpath u1, . . . , ui that crosses an edge in the subpath

1If H has only one vertex, then Forb≺(H) consists only of the graph with empty vertex set and
one can think of f≺(H) as being equal to 0. However, we will avoid this pathologic case throughout.

ui, . . . , un. See Figure 1 (last row, left and middle). Note that there are crossing
paths which are not tangled, see for example Figure 1 (right).

Theorem 1. If an ordered graph H contains a cycle, a bonnet, or a tangled path,
then f≺(H) = ∞.

A vertex v of an ordered graph G is called inner cut vertex, if there is no edge
uw with u ≺ v ≺ w in G and v is not leftmost or rightmost in G. An interval in an
ordered graph G is a set I of vertices such that for all vertices u, v ∈ I, x ∈ V (G)
with u ≺ x ≺ v we have x ∈ I. A segment of an ordered graph G with |V (G)| (cid:62) 2
is an induced subgraph H of G such that |V (H)| (cid:62) 2, V (H) is an interval in G, the

leftmost and rightmost vertices in H are either inner cut vertices of G or leftmost
respectively rightmost in G, and all other vertices in H are not inner cut vertices in
G. So, G is the union of its segments, any two segments share at most one vertex
and the inner cut vertices of G are precisely the vertices contained in two segments
of G. In particular, the number of inner cut vertices of G is exactly one less than
the number of its segments. See Figure 2.

The length of an edge xy is the number of vertices v such that x (cid:22) v ≺ y. A
shortest edge among all the edges incident to a vertex x is referred to as a shortest
edge incident to x. Note that there is either 1 or 2 shortest edges incident to a given
vertex in a connected graph on at least two vertices. Let U be a vertex set in an
ordered tree T , such that each vertex in U has exactly one shortest edge incident to
it. For such a set U , let S(U ) be the set of edges eu such that eu is a shortest edge
incident to u, u ∈ U . We call an ordered tree T monotonically alternating if
there is a partition V (T ) = L ˙∪R, with L ≺ R, such that L and R are independent
sets in T , E = S(L) ∪ S(R), and neither S(L) nor S(R) contains a pair of crossing

edges.

Theorem 2. An ordered tree T contains neither a bonnet nor a tangled path if and
only if each segment of T is monotonically alternating. In particular if f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞
for some connected ordered graph H, then each segment in H is a monotonically
alternating tree.

Recall that an ordered graph is non-crossing if it does not contain any crossing

edges. Note that a non-crossing graph does not contain tangled paths.
Theorem 3. Let T be a non-crossing ordered graph on k vertices. Then f≺(T ) (cid:54)= ∞
if and only if T is a forest that does not contain a bonnet.
Moreover, if f≺(T ) (cid:54)= ∞ then k−1 (cid:54) f≺(T ) (cid:54) 2k. If, in addition T is connected,
then f≺(T ) (cid:54) 2k − 3. Finally, for each k (cid:62) 4 there is an ordered non-crossing tree
T with k (cid:54) f≺(T ) (cid:54)= ∞, while for k = 2, 3 we have f≺(T ) = k − 1.
For certain classes of ordered forests we prove better upper bounds on f≺. A
k-nesting is an ordered graph T on vertices u1 ≺ ··· ≺ uk ≺ vk ≺ ··· ≺ v1 and edges
uivi, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) k. A k-crossing is an ordered graph T on vertices u1 ≺ ··· ≺ uk ≺
v1 ≺ ··· ≺ vk and edges uivi, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) k. We may omit the parameter k if it is not

important. A generalized star is a union of a star and isolated vertices.

The following theorem summarizes several results on trees which are either not

covered by Theorem 3 or improve the upper bound from Theorem 3 signiﬁcantly.

One of the known classes of such graphs is a special family of star forests, or,
in other words, tuple matchings. For positive integers m and t and a permutation
π of [t], an m-tuple t-matching M = M (t, m, π) is an ordered graph with vertices
v1 ≺ ··· ≺ vt(m+1), where each edge is of the form vivt+j+m(π(i)−1) for 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) t,
1 (cid:54) j (cid:54) m. I.e., an m-tuple t-matching is a vertex disjoint union of t stars on m
edges each, where v1, . . . , vt are the centers of the stars that are to the left of all
leaves and the leaves of each star form an interval in M , so that these intervals are
ordered according to the permutation π. The third item in the following theorem is
an immediate corollary of a result by Weidert [19] who provides a linear upper bound
on the the extremal function for M . The other results are based on linear upper
bounds for the extremal functions of nestings due to Dujmovic and Wood [10], on
the extremal function of crossings due to Capoyleas and Pach [5] and lower bounds
for ordered Ramsey numbers due to Conlon et al. [7], see also Balko et al. [2]. See
Section 3 for a more detailed description of extremal functions and ordered Ramsey
numbers.

• If each segment of T is either a generalized star, a 2-nesting, or a 2-crossing,

then f≺(T ) = k − 1.
• If each segment of T is either a nesting, a crossing, a generalized star, or a
non-crossing tree without bonnets, then k − 1 (cid:54) f≺(T ) (cid:54) 2k − 3.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce all missing necessary
notions. In Section 3 we summarize the known results on extremal functions and
Ramsey numbers for ordered graphs and show how they could be used in determining
f≺. In Section 4 we prove some structural lemmas and provide several reductions
that are used in the proofs of the main results and that might be of independent
interest. Section 5 contains the proofs of Theorems 1–4. We summarize all known
results for forests with at most three edges in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 contains
conclusions and open questions.

2 Deﬁnitions

Let Kn denote a complete graph on n vertices. For a positive integer n and an
ordered graph H, let ex≺(n, H) denote the ordered extremal number, i.e., the largest
number of edges in an ordered graph on n vertices in Forb≺(H). For an ordered
graph H the ordered Ramsey number R≺(H) is the smallest integer n such that in
any edge-coloring of an ordered Kn in two colors there is a monochromatic copy of
H. Recall that an interval in an ordered graph G is a set I of vertices such that
for all vertices u, v ∈ I, x ∈ V (G) with u ≺ x ≺ v we have x ∈ I. The interval
chromatic number χ≺(G) of an ordered graph G is the smallest number of intervals,
each inducing an independent set in G, needed to partition V (G). An inner cut
vertex v of an ordered graph G splits G into ordered graphs G1 and G2 if G1 is
induced by all vertices u with u (cid:22) v in G and G2 is induced by all vertices u with
v (cid:22) u. A vertex of degree 1 is called a leaf. A vertex in an ordered graph G is
called reducible, if it is a leaf in G, is leftmost or rightmost in G and has a common
neighbor with the vertex next to it. We call an edge uv in a graph G isolated if
u and v are leaves in G. A graph G is t-degenerate if each subgraph of G has a
vertex of degree at most t. A vertex v is between vertices u and w if u (cid:22) v (cid:22) w.
The reverse G of an ordered graph G is the ordered graph obtained by reversing the
ordering of the vertices in G. A u-v-path P is a path starting with u and ending
with v, i.e., a path v1, . . . , vk with u = v1, v = vk. Given a path P = v1, . . . , vk let
viP = vi, . . . , vk and P vi = v1, . . . , vi. Similarly for a neighbor v (cid:54)∈ V (P ) of v1 let
vP = v, v1, . . . , vk. If U ⊆ V (G), F ⊆ E(G) let G[U ], G − U and G − F denote

(cid:1)), and (V (G), E(G) (cid:114) F ),

the graphs (U, E(G) ∩
respectively. In particular if u, v ∈ V (G) then G − {u, v} is the graph obtained by
removing u and v from G, not the edge uv only. If u ∈ V (G) let G − u = G − {u}.
The deﬁnitions of tangled paths, bonnets, crossing edges and subgraphs, intervals,
segments, inner cut-vertices, and monotonically alternating trees are given before
the statements of the main theorems in the introduction. We shall typically denote
a general ordered graph by H, a tree or a forest by T , and a larger ordered graph by
G. For all other undeﬁned graph theoretic notions we refer the reader to West [20].

3 Connections to known results

There are connections between the extremal number ex≺(n, H) and the function
f≺(H). If there is a constant c such that ex≺(n, H) < c n for every n, then

f≺(H) (cid:54) 2c,

(1)

so f≺(H) is ﬁnite. Indeed, if ex≺(n, H) < c n then any G ∈ Forb≺(H) has less than
c|V (G)| edges, and hence has a vertex of degree less than 2c. Thus if G ∈ Forb≺(H),
then each subgraph of G is in Forb≺(H), so each subgraph has a vertex of degree
less than 2c, so G is (2c − 1)-degenerate. Therefore χ(G) (cid:54) 2c.

Ordered extremal numbers are studied in detail in [17]. Recall that χ≺(G) is the
smallest number of intervals, each inducing an independent set, needed to partition
the vertices of an ordered graph G. Pach and Tardos [17] prove that for each ordered
graph H

(cid:18)

ex≺(n, H) =

1 −

χ≺(H) − 1

(cid:19)(cid:18)n

(cid:19)

+ o(n2).

For ordered graphs with interval chromatic number 2, Pach and Tardos ﬁnd a
tight relation between the ordered extremal number and pattern avoiding matrices.
For an ordered graph H with χ≺(H) = 2 let A(H) denote the 0-1-matrix where the
rows correspond to the vertices in the ﬁrst color and the columns to the vertices in
the second color of a proper interval coloring of H in 2 colors and let A(H)u,v = 1 if
and only if uv is an edge in H. A 0-1-matrix B avoids another 0-1-matrix A if there
is no submatrix in B which becomes equal to A after replacing some ones with zeros.
For a 0-1-matrix A let ex(n, A) denote the largest number of ones in an n× n matrix
avoiding A. In [17] it is shown that for each ordered graph H with χ≺(H) = 2 there

(cid:5), A(H)) (cid:54) ex≺(n, H) (cid:54) c ex(n, A(H)) log n. Thus,

is a constant c such that ex((cid:4) n

when ex(n, A(H)) is linear in n, one can guarantee that ex≺(n, H) = O(n log n), but
this is not enough to claim that f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞.
In addition, we see that there is no direct connection between f≺(H) and ex≺(n, H)
because there are dense ordered graphs avoiding H for some ordered graphs H with
small f≺(H). A speciﬁc example for such a graph H is an ordered path u1u2u3u4,
with u1 ≺ u2 ≺ u3 ≺ u4. One can see from Theorem 4 that f≺(H) = 3, but a
complete bipartite ordered graph G with all vertices of one bipartition class to the
left of all other vertices does not contain H and has |V (G)|2/4 edges. However,

2

for some ordered graphs H with interval chromatic number 2, one can show that
ex≺(n, H) is linear. This in turn, implies that f≺(H) is ﬁnite.

Some of the extensive research on forbidden binary matrices and extremal func-

tions for ordered graphs can be found in [3, 12, 14, 15, 16].

G2 yields a proper coloring of Kn. Therefore f≺(H) (cid:62) (cid:112)

There are also connections between the Ramsey numbers R≺(H) for ordered
graphs and the function f≺(H). If the edges of Kn, n = R≺(H) − 1, are colored in
two colors without monochromatic copies of H, then both color classes form ordered
graphs G1 and G2 not containing H as an ordered subgraph. Then one of the Gi’s
has chromatic number at least √n, since a product of proper colorings of G1 and
R≺(H) − 1. Ordered
Ramsey numbers were recently studied by Conlon et al. [7] and Balko et al. [2].
Other research on ordered graphs includes characterizations of classes of graphs by
forbidden ordered subgraphs [8, 13] and the study of perfectly ordered graphs [6].

4 Structural Lemmas and Reductions

In this section we ﬁrst analyze the structure of ordered trees without bonnets and
tangled paths. This leads to a proof of Theorem 2 in Section 5. Afterwards we
establish several cases when f≺(H) can be upper bounded in terms of f≺(H(cid:48)) for a
subgraph H(cid:48) of H. This allows us to reduce the problem of whether f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞ to
the problem of whether f≺(H(cid:48)) (cid:54)= ∞. These reductions are the crucial tools in the

proof of Theorem 3 in Section 5.

Lemma 4.1. Let T be an ordered tree that does not contain a tangled path and let
u ≺ v ≺ w be vertices in T . If uw is an edge in T , then all vertices of the path
connecting u and v in T are between u and w.

Proof. Let P be the path in T that starts with v and ends with the edge uw. Let (cid:96)
denote the leftmost vertex in P . Assume for the sake of contradiction that (cid:96) ≺ u.
Then the path vP (cid:96) contains neither u nor w and therefore crosses the edge uw.
Hence the paths P (cid:96) and (cid:96)P cross and P is tangled, a contradiction. Therefore
(cid:96) = u. Due to symmetric arguments w is the rightmost vertex in P . Hence all
vertices in P are between u and w.

Lemma 4.2. Let T be an ordered tree that contains neither a bonnet nor a tangled
path and that has only one segment . Deleting any leaf from T yields an ordered tree
that contains neither a bonnet nor a tangled path and that has only one segment.

Proof. Let uv be an edge in T incident to a leaf u and let T (cid:48) = T − u. Then clearly
T (cid:48) is an ordered tree that contains neither a bonnet nor a tangled path. For the
sake of contradiction assume that T (cid:48) has at least two segments and let x be an inner
cut vertex in T (cid:48). Then x (cid:54)= u,v and is between u and v in T , since x is not an inner
cut vertex in T . By reversing T if necessary we may assume that v ≺ x ≺ u. Let P
be the v-x-path in T (cid:48). All vertices in P are between v and u by Lemma 4.1 applied
to u, v and x. In addition no vertex in P is to the right of x since x is an inner cut

and H2 (left), an isolated edge uv in an ordered graph H (middle), and a reducible
vertex u (right).
vertex in T (cid:48). So all vertices in P are between v and x. Let vw denote the ﬁrst edge
of P and let xy denote an edge in T (cid:48) with x ≺ y. Such an edge xy exists since the
inner cut vertex x is not rightmost in T (cid:48) and T (cid:48) is connected. If u ≺ y, then uvP xy
is a tangled path in T . If y ≺ u, then u, v, w, x and y form a bonnet in T . In both
cases we have a contradiction and hence T (cid:48) has only one segment.

Lemma 4.3. If T is an ordered tree that contains neither a bonnet nor a tangled
path and that has only one segment, then χ≺(T ) (cid:54) 2.

If k (cid:54) 2, then clearly
Proof. We prove the claim by induction on k = |V (T )|.
χ≺(T ) (cid:54) 2. So assume that k (cid:62) 3. Let u denote a leaf in T , v its neighbor in T , and
let T (cid:48) = T − u. Then T (cid:48) has only one segment and contains neither a bonnet nor
a tangled path due to Lemma 4.2. Inductively χ≺(T (cid:48)) (cid:54) 2, i.e., there is a partition
L ˙∪R = V (T (cid:48)), with L ≺ R, such that all edges in T (cid:48) are between L and R. By
reversing T if necessary we assume that v ∈ L. For the sake of contradiction assume
that χ≺(T ) > 2. Then u ≺ (cid:96) for the rightmost vertex (cid:96) in L, possibly (cid:96) = v. Let
w ∈ R denote one ﬁxed neighbor of v in T (cid:48). Then all vertices of the path connecting
(cid:96) and v in T (cid:48) are between v and w due to Lemma 4.1. In particular (cid:96) is incident
to an edge (cid:96)x, x ∈ R, with x (cid:22) w. Hence u ≺ v, since otherwise there is a bonnet
on vertices v, u, (cid:96), x, and w in T . If there is a vertex y, u ≺ y ≺ v, then all vertices
of the path connecting y and u in T are between u and v due to Lemma 4.1. But
this is not possible since y, v ∈ L and all the neighbors of y are in R. Hence u is
immediately to the left of v in T . Note that u is not leftmost in T , since otherwise
v is an inner cut vertex in T . Consider the path P connecting a vertex left of u to
(cid:96) in T . This path contains distinct vertices p, q ∈ L, r ∈ R, such that pr and rq are
edges in P and p ≺ u ≺ v (cid:22) q ≺ r. Hence there is a bonnet, a contradiction. This
shows that χ≺(T ) (cid:54) 2.

We now present several reductions. Let us mention that some of the following
arguments are similar to reductions used for extremal numbers of matrices [17, 18].
Recall, that an inner cut vertex v of an ordered graph H splits H into ordered
graphs H1 and H2, where H1 is induced by all vertices u with u (cid:22) v in H and H2
is induced by all vertices u with v (cid:22) u. See Figure 4 (left).
Reduction Lemma 1. If an inner cut vertex v splits an ordered graph H into
ordered graphs H1 and H2 with f≺(H1), f≺(H2) (cid:54)= ∞, then

f≺(H) (cid:54) f≺(H1) + f≺(H2).

H2H1vuvH−{u,v}uH−uProof. Consider an ordered graph G ∈ Forb≺(H). Let V1 denote the set of vertices
in G that are rightmost in some copy of H1 in G. Further let V2 = V (G) (cid:114) V1.
Then G[V2] ∈ Forb≺(H1) by the choice of V1. Moreover G[V1] ∈ Forb≺(H2), since
otherwise the leftmost vertex u in a copy of H2 in G[V1] is also a rightmost vertex
in a copy of H1 and hence plays the role of v in a copy of H in G. Thus χ(G) (cid:54)
χ(G[V1]) + χ(G[V2]) (cid:54) f≺(H2) + f≺(H1) and since G ∈ Forb≺(H) was arbitrary we
have f≺(H) (cid:54) f≺(H1) + f≺(H2).

Reduction Lemma 2. If v is an isolated vertex in an ordered graph H with

|V (H)| (cid:62) 3 and f≺(H − v) (cid:54)= ∞, then f≺(H) (cid:54) 2 f≺(H − v).
Proof. Consider an ordered graph G ∈ Forb≺(H). If v is not leftmost or rightmost in
H, then let V1 denote a set of every other vertex in G and let V2 = V (G)(cid:114) V1. Then
G[V1], G[V2] ∈ Forb≺(H − v), since for any two vertices u ≺ w in Vi there is a vertex
v ∈ V3−i with u ≺ v ≺ w, i = 1, 2. Hence χ(G) (cid:54) χ(G[V1])+χ(G[V2]) (cid:54) 2f≺(H −v).
If v is the leftmost or the rightmost in H, assume without loss of generality the
former. Then clearly G − u ∈ Forb≺(H − v) for the leftmost vertex u of G. Thus
χ(G) (cid:54) 1 + χ(G − u) (cid:54) 1 + f≺(H − v) (cid:54) 2f≺(H − v). Since G ∈ Forb≺(H) was
arbitrary we have f≺(H) (cid:54) 2f≺(H − v) in both cases.

f≺(H) (cid:54) 2 f≺(H − {u, v}) + 1.

Proof. See Figure 4 (middle). Let H(cid:48) = H − {u, v} and consider an ordered graph
If G does not contain a copy of H(cid:48), then χ(G) (cid:54) f≺(H(cid:48)) (cid:54)
G ∈ Forb≺(H).
2f≺(H(cid:48)) + 1. So, assume that G contains a copy of H(cid:48). Let V1 ˙∪··· ˙∪Vp denote a
partition of V (G) into disjoint intervals with V1 ≺ ··· ≺ Vp, vi being the leftmost
vertex in Vi, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) p, such that G[Vi] ∈ Forb≺(H(cid:48)), 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) p, and G[Vi ∪ {vi+1}]
contains a copy of H(cid:48), 1 (cid:54) i < p. Note that one can ﬁnd such a partition greedily by
iteratively choosing a largest interval from the left that does not induce any copy of
H(cid:48) in G. If p (cid:62) 3, there are no edges xy with x ∈ Vi and vi+2 ≺ y, since otherwise
xy together with a copy of H(cid:48) in G[Vi+1 ∪ {vi+2}] forms a copy of H, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) p − 2.
Choose a set Φ of 2 f≺(H(cid:48)) + 1 distinct colors. Let Φ1, . . . , Φp ⊂ Φ denote
subsets of colors such that |Φi| = f≺(H(cid:48)), 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) p, Φi ∩ Φi+1 = ∅, 1 (cid:54) i < p,
and, if p (cid:62) 3, Φi+2 (cid:114) (Φi ∪ Φi+1) (cid:54)= ∅, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) p − 2. Note that such sets Φi can
be chosen greedily from Φ. Since G[Vi] ∈ Forb≺(H(cid:48)) we can color G[Vi] properly
with colors from Φi, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) p, such that, if i (cid:62) 3, vi is colored with a color in
Φi (cid:114) (Φi−1 ∪ Φi−2). This yields a proper coloring of G using colors from the set
Φ only. Hence χ(G) (cid:54) 2 f≺(H(cid:48)) + 1. Since G ∈ Forb≺(H) was arbitrary we have
f≺(H) (cid:54) 2 f≺(H − {u, v}) + 1.

Recall, that a vertex in an ordered graph H is called reducible, if it is a leaf in
H, is leftmost or rightmost in H and has a common neighbor with the vertex next
to it. See Figure 4 (right).

Reduction Lemma 4. Let H denote an ordered graph with |V (H)| (cid:62) 3. If u is a
reducible vertex in H and f≺(H − u) (cid:54)= ∞, then

f≺(H) (cid:54) 2 f≺(H − u).

Moreover, for each G ∈ Forb≺(H) there is G(cid:48)
deleting the edges of G(cid:48) from G yields a graph from Forb≺(H − u).

⊆ G such that G(cid:48) is 1-degenerate and

Proof. By reversing H if necessary we may assume that the reducible vertex u is
leftmost in H. Let G ∈ Forb≺(H). Let E denote the set of edges in G consisting
for each vertex w in G of the longest edge to the left incident to w in G, if such an
edge exists.

Assume that there is a copy H(cid:48) of H − u in G− E. Let v denote the vertex in H(cid:48)
corresponding to the vertex immediately to the right of u in H and let w denote the
vertex in H(cid:48) corresponding to the neighbor of u in H. Then v is leftmost in H(cid:48) and
there is an edge between v and w in H(cid:48). Thus, there is an edge xw in E incident
to w in G with x ≺ v. Hence H(cid:48) extends to a copy of H in G with the edge xw, a
contradiction. This shows that G − E ∈ Forb≺(H − u).
Finally observe that the graph G(cid:48) with the edge-set E is 1-degenerate and hence
2-colorable. This shows that χ(G) (cid:54) χ(G(cid:48))χ(G − E) (cid:54) 2f≺(H − u) and since
G ∈ Forb≺(H) was arbitrary we have f≺(H) (cid:54) 2f≺(H − u).

Having Reduction Lemma 4 at hand, we are now ready to prove that every

non-crossing monotonically alternating tree T satisﬁes f≺(T ) (cid:54)= ∞.
Lemma 4.4. If T is a non-crossing monotonically alternating tree with |V (T )| (cid:62) 2,

then

f≺(T ) (cid:54) 2|V (T )| − 3.

Proof. Let k = |V (T )| and G ∈ Forb≺(T ). We shall prove that G can be edge-
decomposed into (k − 2) 1-degenerate graphs by induction on k.
If k = 2, then T consists of a single edge only. Hence G has an empty edge-set
and there is nothing to prove.
So consider k (cid:62) 3 and assume that the induction statement holds for all smaller
values of k. Assume for the sake of contradiction that the leftmost vertex u and the
rightmost w in T are of degree at least 2. Then the longest and the shortest edge
incident to w do not coincide. Let e be the longest edge incident to w. Since in
a monotonically alternating tree each edge is the shortest edge incident to its left
or right endpoint, e is the shortest edge incident to its left endpoint. In particular,
e (cid:54)= uw because u is incident to another edge e(cid:48), shorter than uw. Thus e and e(cid:48)
cross since χ≺(T ) (cid:54) 2, a contradiction. Hence the leftmost or the rightmost vertex
is a leaf in T .

By reversing T if necessary we assume that u is of degree 1. We shall show
that u is a reducible leaf. To do so, we need to show that the vertex x that is
immediately to the right of u is adjacent to the neighbor v of u. Assume for the sake
of contradiction that x is not adjacent to v. Note that v is adjacent to a leaf, so it

10

is not a leaf itself. Let e(cid:48)(cid:48) be an edge incident to v, e(cid:48)(cid:48)
(cid:54)= uv. Then an edge incident
to x crosses either uv or e(cid:48)(cid:48) since χ≺(T ) (cid:54) 2, a contradiction. Thus x is adjacent to
v and u is a reducible leaf in T .
Therefore, by Reduction Lemma 4, there is a 1-degenerate subgraph G(cid:48) of G
such that removing the edges of G(cid:48) from G yields a graph G(cid:48)(cid:48)
∈ Forb≺(T − u).
Observe that the tree T − u is non-crossing and monotonically alternating with
k > |V (T − u)| = k − 1 (cid:62) 2. Hence G(cid:48)(cid:48) can be edge-decomposed into (k − 3)
1-degenerate graphs G1, . . . , Gk−3 by induction. Thus the graphs G1, . . . , Gk−3, G(cid:48)
decompose G into (k − 2) 1-degenerate graphs, proving the induction step.
If k = 2, we know that G has no edges and χ(G) = 1 (cid:54) 2|V (T )| − 3. So assume
that k (cid:62) 3. Singe G is a union of (k−2) 1-degenerate graphs, each subgraph of G is a
union of (k−2) 1-degenerate graphs, so each subgraph G∗ of G on at least one vertex
that has at most (k − 2)(|V (G∗)|− 1) edges, and thus has a vertex of degree at most
2(k−2)−1. Therefore G is (2(k−2)−1)-degenerate, so χ(G) (cid:54) 2(k−2) (cid:54) 2|V (T )|−3.
Since G ∈ Forb≺(H) was arbitrary we have f≺(H) (cid:54) 2|V (T )| − 3.

Reduction Lemma 5. Let T denote an ordered matching on at least 2 edges. If
uv is an edge in T and u and v are consecutive and f≺(T − {u, v}) (cid:54)= ∞, then

f≺(T ) (cid:54) 3 f≺(T − {u, v}).

Proof. Let G ∈ Forb≺(T ) with vertices v1 ≺ ··· ≺ vn. We shall prove that χ(G) (cid:54)
If n (cid:54) 3 f≺(T − {u, v}), then the
3 f≺(T − {u, v}) by induction on n = |V (G)|.
claim holds trivially. So assume that n > 3 f≺(T − {u, v}) (cid:62) 3. If there are two
consecutive vertices x, y in G that are not adjacent, then let G(cid:48) denote the graph
obtained by identifying x and y. Then G(cid:48)
∈ Forb≺(T ) and χ(G) (cid:54) χ(G(cid:48)). Hence
χ(G) (cid:54) χ(G(cid:48)) (cid:54) 3 f≺(T − {u, v}) by induction. If each pair of consecutive vertices
in G forms an edge, then consider a partition V (G) = V0 ˙∪V1 ˙∪V2 such that Vi =
{vj ∈ V (G) | j ≡ i (mod 3)}. Observe that for each pair of vertices x, y ∈ Vi
there are at least two adjacent vertices from V (G) (cid:114) Vi between x and y. Hence
G[Vi] ∈ Forb≺(T − {u, v}), i = 0, 1, 2, since any copy of T − {u, v} in G[Vi] extends
to a copy of T in G. Hence χ(G) (cid:54) 3 f≺(T − {u, v}) and since G ∈ Forb≺(H) was
arbitrary we have f≺(H) (cid:54) 3 f≺(T − {u, v}).
5 Proofs of Theorems

5.1 Proof of Theorem 1

We will prove that if an ordered graph H contains a cycle, a tangled path or a
bonnet then for each positive integer k there is an ordered graph G ∈ Forb≺(H)
with χ(G) (cid:62) k.

First assume that H contain a cycle of length (cid:96). Fix a positive integer k and
consider a graph G of girth at least (cid:96) + 1 and chromatic number at least k that exists

11

Figure 5: A graph Gk obtained by Tutte’s construction from a graph Gk−1. Here
Gk[Ui] = Gk−1, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) M .

by [11]. Then no ordering of the vertices of G gives an ordered subgraph isomorphic

to H. This shows that for any positive integer k, f≺(H) (cid:62) k and hence f≺(H) = ∞.
A tangled path is minimal if it does not contain a proper subpath that is tangled.
Next we shall show that for each minimal tangled path P and each k (cid:62) 1 there is
an ordered graph Gk ∈ Forb≺(P ) with χ(Gk) (cid:62) k.

n

By reversing P if necessary we assume that in P the paths P u and uP cross
If
for the rightmost vertex u in P . We will prove the claim by induction on k.
k (cid:54) 3 let Gk = Kk that has no crossing edges and thus no tangled paths. Consider
k (cid:62) 4 and let Gk−1 denote an n-vertex graph of chromatic number at least k − 1
(cid:1). Consider pairwise disjoint sets of vertices

that does not contain a copy of P . Such a graph exists by induction. The following
construction is due to Tutte (alias Blanche Descartes) for unordered graphs [9]. Let

N = (k − 1)(n − 1) + 1 and M = (cid:0)N

U1, . . . , UM , V such that |Ui| = n, i = 1, . . . , M , |V | = N and U1 ≺ ··· ≺ UM ≺ V .
Let V1, . . . , VM be the n-element subsets of V . Let each Ui, i = 1, . . . , M , induce a
copy of Gk−1. Finally let there be a perfect matching between Ui and Vi such that
the jth vertex in Ui is matched to the jth vertex in Vi, i = 1, . . . , M . See Figure 5.
First we shall show that χ(Gk) (cid:62) k. If there are at most k − 1 colors assigned

to the vertices of Gk, then by Pigeonhole Principle there are n vertices of V of the
same color, i.e., there is a set Vi with all vertices of the same color, say color 1. Since
each vertex of Ui is adjacent to a vertex in Vi, no vertex in Ui is colored 1, so if the
coloring is proper, then G[Ui] uses at most k − 2 colors. Hence the coloring is not
proper, since χ(G[Ui]) = χ(Gk−1) (cid:62) k − 1. Therefore χ(Gk) (cid:62) k.
Now, we shall show that Gk does not contain a copy of P . Assume that there
is such a copy P (cid:48) of P in Gk with rightmost vertex u of P (cid:48). Let x and y be the
neighbors of u in P (cid:48), i.e., P (cid:48) is a union of paths P (cid:48)yu and uxP (cid:48). Then u ∈ V and
x, y (cid:54)∈ V , since G[Ui] does not contain a copy of P and there are no edges in Gk[V ].
Let x ∈ Ui and y ∈ Uj. Note that i (cid:54)= j because the edges between Ui and V form
a matching. The path uxP (cid:48) is a proper subpath of P (cid:48) and hence is not tangled.
Recall that for each edge zw with z ∈ Ui, w ∈ V , and w ≺ u, we have z ≺ x due
to the construction of the matching between Ui and Vi. Hence the path uxP (cid:48) does
not contain any vertex w ∈ V with w ≺ u, since otherwise the path uxP (cid:48)w has a
vertex left of x contradicting Lemma 4.1 applied to u, x and w. Hence V (xP (cid:48)) ⊆ Ui,
because there are no edges between Ui’s and u is rightmost in P (cid:48). See Figure 6.
Similarly, all vertices of P (cid:48)y are contained in Uj. Thus P (cid:48)u and uP (cid:48) do not cross.
However, P (cid:48) is a copy of P with respective subpaths crossing, a contradiction. Hence
Gk ∈ Forb≺(P ).

are not tangled.

Now, if an ordered graph H contains a tangled path, then it contains a minimal

tangled path. Thus f≺(H) = ∞.

Now, let B be a bonnet. By reversing B if necessary, we assume that B has
vertices u ≺ v (cid:22) x, y (cid:22) w and edges uv, uw, xy. A shift graph S(n) is deﬁned on
vertices {(i, j) | 1 (cid:54) i < j (cid:54) n} and edges {{(i, j), (j, t)} | 1 (cid:54) i < j < t (cid:54) n}. We
will show that some ordering of S(n) does not contain B. Let G = S(n) be a shift
graph with vertices ordered lexicographically, i.e., (x1, x2) ≺ (y1, y2) if and only if
x1 < y1, or x1 = y1 and x2 < y2. Assume that G contains vertices u = (u1, u2),
v = (v1, v2), x = (x1, x2), y = (y1, y2) and w = (w1, w2) that form a copy of B with
u ≺ v (cid:22) x, y (cid:22) w and edges uv, uw, xy. Then u2 = v1, u2 = w1, x2 = y1. Thus
v1 = w1. However, since v (cid:22) x, y (cid:22) w, we have that v1 (cid:54) x1, y1 (cid:54) w1, so x1 =
y1 = v1 = w1. But x2 = y1, thus x2 = x1, a contradiction. Thus G ∈ Forb≺(B).
We claim that χ(G) (cid:62) log(n) (cid:62) log c|V (G)|. Indeed consider a proper coloring φ
of G using χ(G) colors and sets of colors Φi = {φ(i, j) | i < j (cid:54) n}, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) n.
Then φ(i, j) (cid:54)∈ Φj, since a vertex (i, j) is adjacent to all vertices (j, t), j < t (cid:54) n.
Therefore Φi (cid:54)= Φj for all j < i. Hence all the sets of colors are distinct. This
shows that 2χ(G) (cid:62) n, since there are at most 2χ(G) distinct subsets of colors. This
proves that χ(G) (cid:62) log(n). Thus, for any k, there is an ordered graph of chromatic
number at least k in Forb≺(B). So, if an ordered graph H contains a bonnet, then
f≺(H) = ∞.
5.2 Proof of Theorem 2
Let T (cid:48) be a segment of an ordered tree that does not contain a bonnet or a tangled
path. We shall prove that T (cid:48) is monotonically alternating by induction on k =
|V (T (cid:48))|. Every ordered tree on at most two vertices is monotonically alternating.
So suppose k (cid:62) 3. We have χ≺(T (cid:48)) = 2 due to Lemma 4.3.
Claim. The leftmost or the rightmost vertex in T (cid:48) is of degree 1.

Proof of Claim. For the sake of contradiction assume that both the leftmost vertex
u and the rightmost vertex v in T (cid:48) are of degree at least 2. If u and v are adjacent
then the edge uv, another edge incident to u and another edge incident v form a
tangled path since χ≺(T (cid:48)) = 2, a contradiction. If u and v are not adjacent let P
denote the path in T (cid:48) connecting u and v. It uses at most one of the edges incident
to u. Then any other edge zu incident to u crosses the edge in P that is incident
to v since χ≺(T (cid:48)) = 2. Hence zP forms a tangled path, a contradiction. This shows
that at least one of u or v is a leaf in T (cid:48).
(cid:52)

uyxUiUjVBy reversing T (cid:48) if necessary we assume that the leftmost vertex u is a leaf in T (cid:48).
The ordered tree T (cid:48)
− u is monotonically alternating by induction and Lemma 4.2.
Consider the partition V (T (cid:48)) = L ˙∪R, with L ≺ R and L and R being independent
sets. Such a partition is unique since T (cid:48) is connected. Let v be the neighbor of u in
T (cid:48). Since χ≺(T (cid:48)) = 2, v ∈ R. Since T (cid:48) is connected, k (cid:62) 3 and u is leftmost in T (cid:48),
the edge uv is not the shortest edge incident to v. Hence uv (cid:54)∈ S(R) and therefore
S(R) has no crossing edges by induction. Clearly uv ∈ S(L) since uv is the only
edge incident to u and thus it is the shortest incident to u edge. If uv crosses some
edge xy in T (cid:48), x ≺ y, then all vertices in the path connecting v and x are between x
and v due to Lemma 4.1 applied to x, y and v. Therefore xy is not the shortest edge
incident to x and hence xy (cid:54)∈ S(L). This shows that S(L) has no crossing edges and
thus T (cid:48) is monotonically alternating.
The other way round assume that each segment of an ordered tree T is mono-
tonically alternating. We need to show that each segment contains neither a bonnet

nor a tangled path. Let T (cid:48) denote a segment of T , V (T (cid:48)) = L ∪ R, L ≺ R and
E(T (cid:48)) = S(L) ∪ S(R), so each edges is either a shortest edge incident to a vertex
in R or a shortest edge incident to a vertex in L. Then χ≺(T (cid:48)) (cid:54) 2 and hence T (cid:48)
does not contain a bonnet. We will prove that T (cid:48) does not contain a tangled path
by induction on k = |V (T (cid:48))|. If k (cid:54) 3, then there are no crossing edges in T (cid:48) and
hence no tangled path. Suppose k (cid:62) 4.
Assume that the leftmost vertex u and the rightmost vertex w in T (cid:48) are of
degree at least 2. If uw ∈ E(T (cid:48)) then uw (cid:54)∈ S(L) and uw (cid:54)∈ S(R), a contradiction.
So, uw (cid:54)∈ E(T (cid:48)). Consider the longest edge xw incident to w. Then x (cid:54)= u and
since xw (cid:54)∈ S(R), xw ∈ S(L). Then the shortest edge incident to u crosses xw, a
contradiction since S(L) does not contain crossing edges. Hence the leftmost or the
rightmost vertex is a leaf in T (cid:48).
By reversing T (cid:48) if necessary we assume that the leftmost vertex u is a leaf. We
see that T (cid:48)
− u is monotonically alternating, thus by induction it does not contain a
tangled path. Hence if T (cid:48) has a tangled path P , then P contains an edge uv crossing
some other edge in P , where v is the neighbor of u in T (cid:48). Then the rightmost vertex
r in P is of degree 2 and to the right of v, since P is tangled and u is leftmost and
of degree 1 in T (cid:48). Let x and y, x ≺ y, be neighbors of r in P . Then xr is the
shortest edge incident to x, since any shorter edge forms a tangled path with r and
− u. This is a contradiction since uv and xr cross and T (cid:48) is monotonically
y in T (cid:48)
alternating. Thus T (cid:48) has no tangled path.

Finally we prove the last statement of the theorem. If H is a connected ordered
graph with f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞, then H is a tree that contains neither a bonnet nor a tangled
path due to Theorem 1. Hence each segment of H is a monotonically alternating
tree.

14

5.3 Proof of Theorem 3
Let T be a non-crossing ordered graph such that f≺(T ) (cid:54)= ∞. Then T is acyclic,
contains no tangled path and no bonnet by Theorem 1. Hence T is a non-crossing
ordered forest with no bonnet.

On the other hand let T be a non-crossing forest with no bonnet. Recall that

f≺(H) (cid:62) k − 1 for each ordered k-vertex graph H because Kk−1 ∈ Forb≺(H).
We shall prove that f≺(T ) (cid:54)= ∞. Let k = |V (T )| and consider any ordered graph
G ∈ Forb≺(T ). We will prove by induction on k that χ(G) (cid:54) 2k and χ(G) (cid:54) 2k − 3
if T is a tree. If k = 2, then clearly χ(G) = 1. So consider k (cid:62) 3.

If T is a tree, then each segment of T is a monotonically alternating tree, by

Theorem 2. If there is only one segment in T , then f≺(T ) (cid:54) 2k − 3 by Lemma 4.4.

If there is more than one segment in T , then there is an inner cut vertex splitting T
into two trees T1 and T2 that are clearly also non-crossing and contain no bonnet.
Thus by Reduction Lemma 1 and induction we have f≺(T ) (cid:54) f≺(T1) + f≺(T2) (cid:54)
2|V (T1)| − 3 + 2|V (T2)| − 3 = 2(|V (T )| + 1) − 6 = 2k − 4.

If T is a forest we consider several cases. If T has more than one segment, then
there is an inner cut vertex splitting T into two forests T1 and T2 that are clearly
also non-crossing and contain no bonnet. Thus by Reduction Lemma 1 and induc-
tion we have f≺(T ) (cid:54) f≺(T1) + f≺(T2) (cid:54) 2|V (T1)| + 2|V (T2)| = 2t + 2k+1−t (cid:54) 2k
with t = |V (T1)| (cid:62) 2. If T has an isolated vertex u, then by Reduction Lemma 2
and induction we have f≺(T ) (cid:54) 2f≺(T − u) (cid:54) 2 · 2k−1 = 2k. Finally, if T has no

isolated vertices and exactly one segment, then consider the leftmost and rightmost
vertices u and v of T . Since u and v are not isolated in this case, and T is non-
If uv is isolated, then k (cid:62) 4
crossing with no inner cut vertices, uv is an edge.
(since there is no isolated vertex) and by Reduction Lemma 3 and induction we
have f≺(T ) (cid:54) 2 · f≺(T − {u, v}) + 1 (cid:54) 2 · 2k−2 + 1 (cid:54) 2k. If uv is not isolated, then
either u or v, say u, is a leaf of T , since T is non-crossing and does not contain a
bonnet. Let xv denote the longest edge incident to v in T − u. Note that x exists
since the edge uv is not isolated. Then there is no other vertex between u and x,
since such a vertex would be isolated in the non-crossing forest T without bonnets.
Thus, u is a reducible vertex, so by Reduction Lemma 4 and induction we have

f≺(T ) (cid:54) 2f≺(T − u) (cid:54) 2 · 2k−1 = 2k.

Next, we provide a k-vertex non-crossing tree with no bonnet such that ∞ (cid:54)=
f≺(T ) (cid:62) k. Let T be a monotonically alternating path on k (cid:62) 4 vertices with
leftmost vertex of degree 1, as in Figure 7 (right). Further let G denote a graph
on vertices u ≺ x1 ≺ ··· ≺ xk−2 ≺ y1 ≺ ··· ≺ yk−2 ≺ x ≺ y such that xy is an
edge and {u, x1, . . . , xk−2}, {u, y1, . . . , yk−2}, {x, x1, . . . , xk−2}, and {y, y1, . . . , yk−2}
induce complete graphs on k − 1 vertices each. See Figure 7 (left).
We shall show that G ∈ Forb≺(T ) and χ(G) (cid:62) k. Consider a proper vertex

crossing and ordered tree T on k vertices without bonnets on the right, k = 6.

coloring of G using colors 1, . . . , k−1. Without loss of generality u has color 1. Then
all colors 2, . . . , k− 1 are used on the vertices x1, . . . , xk−2 as well as on y1, . . . , yk−2.
Hence both x and y are of color 1, a contradiction. Thus χ(G) (cid:62) k.
Assume that there is a copy P of T in G. Let v be the leftmost and w be the right-
most vertex in P . Note that vw is an edge and that there are k vertices between v and

w. Therefore vw is one of the edges uyi, 1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) k− 2, xjx, 1 (cid:54) j (cid:54) k− 2, or y1y. In
the ﬁrst case V (P ) ⊆ {u, y1, . . . , yk−2}, in the second case V (P ) ⊆ {x1, . . . , xk−2, x}
and in the last case either P = y1, y, x or V (P ) ⊆ {y, y1, . . . , yk−2}. Since T has
at least 4 vertices, P (cid:54)= y1, y, x. So in any case P has at most k − 1 vertices, a
contradiction since T has k vertices. Hence G ∈ Forb≺(T ).

Finally it is easy to see that f≺(T ) = k − 1 for any ordered tree T on at most 3

vertices using Reduction Lemmas 1 and 4.

star on k(cid:48) vertices, then the center of the star is leftmost (or rightmost) in
T (cid:48). Let G ∈ Forb≺(T (cid:48)). Then each vertex in G has at most k(cid:48)
− 2 neighbors
to the right (or to the left). Thus each such graph can be greedily colored
from right to left (or left to right) with at most k(cid:48)
− 1 colors. This shows that
f≺(T (cid:48)) (cid:54) |V (T (cid:48))| − 1.
If T (cid:48) is a 2-nesting, then f≺(T (cid:48)) = 3 = |V (T (cid:48))| − 1
due to [10] (Lemma 9). If T (cid:48) is a 2-crossing, then f≺(T (cid:48)) = 3 = |V (T (cid:48))| − 1,
since any graph not containing T (cid:48) is outerplanar and outerplanar graphs have
above which yield f≺(T ) (cid:54)(cid:80)s
chromatic number at most 3. We apply Reduction Lemma 1 and the results

i=1 f≺(Ti) (cid:54)(cid:80)s

i=1(ki − 1) = k − 1.

• Let T be an ordered forest on k vertices where each segment is a gener-
alized star, a non-crossing tree without bonnets, a crossing or a nesting.
Let T1, . . . , Ts denote the segments of T and ki = |V (Ti)| (cid:62) 2. Let T (cid:48)

G ∈ Forb≺(T (cid:48)) contains less than 2(k(cid:48)

Wood [10] (for nestings), respectively Capoyleas and Pach [5] (for crossings).

• Let T = M (t, m, π) for some positive integers m and t and a permutation π
of [t]. If t = 1, then f≺(T ) = m due to the results above, since M (1, m, π)
is a star on m + 1 vertices. Weidert [19] proves that ex≺(n, M (t, 1, π)) (cid:54)

(cid:1)n < t4(2t2)2tn for any positive integer t (cid:62) 2 and

i=1 f≺(Ti) (cid:54)

any permutation π of [t]. Moreover if m (cid:62) 2, then

2t

ex≺(n, M (t, m, π)) (cid:54) 2t(m−2)ex≺(n, M (t, 2, π))

due to a reduction by Tardos [18]. Therefore ex≺(n, M (t, m, π)) < 2tmt4+4tn.
Thus, using the fact that |V (T )| = k = tm + t and equation (1) we have that
f≺(M (t, m, π)) (cid:54) 2tm+9t log(t) (cid:54) 210k log k.

• Conlon et al. [7] and independently Balko et al. [2] prove that that there is
a positive constant c such that for any suﬃciently large positive integer k
there is an ordered matchings on k vertices with ordered Ramsey number
at least 2c log(k)2
log log(k) .
If, for some ordered graph H, the edges of a complete
ordered graph G on N = R≺(H)− 1 vertices are colored in two colors without
monochromatic copies of H, then both color classes form ordered graphs G1
and G2 in Forb≺(H). Then one of the Gi’s has chromatic number at least √N ,
since a product of proper colorings of G1 and G2 yields a proper coloring of
G using χ(G1)χ(G2) (cid:62) χ(G) = N colors. This shows that there is a positive
constant c(cid:48) such that for all positive integers k and ordered matchings H on k
vertices with f≺(H) (cid:62) 2c(cid:48)

log log(k) .

6 Small Forests

Let Pk denote a path on k vertices, Mk a matching on k edges and Sk a star with
k leaves (note that M1 = S1 = P2 and P3 = S2). Further let G + H denote the
vertex disjoint union of graphs G and H. Then the set of all forests without isolated
vertices and at most 3 edges is given by

{P2, S2, M2, S3, P4, S2 + P2, M3}.

Let G denote a graph on n vertices and a automorphisms. Then the number

ord(G) of non-isomorphic orderings of G equals ord(G) = n!

a . Hence

ord(P2) = 2!
ord(P4) = 4!

2 = 1, ord(S2) = 3!
2 = 12, ord(S2 + P2) = 5!

2 = 3, ord(M2) = 4!

8 = 3, ord(S3) = 4!

3! = 4,

2·2 = 30, ord(M3) = 6!

6·4·2 = 15.

Recall that the reverse T of an ordered graph T is the ordered graph obtained
by reversing the ordering of the vertices in T . Note that f≺(T ) = f≺(T ) for any

17

ordered graph T since G ∈ Forb≺(T ) if and only if G ∈ Forb≺(T ). Table 8 shows all
ordered forests T without isolated vertices and at most 3 edges and their f≺ values,
where only one of T and T is listed. So when T and T are not isomorphic ordered
graphs the entry in the table represents two graphs. Such cases are marked with
an ∗. For example there are only two instead of three entries for S2 and similarly
for the other graphs.

7 Conclusions

In this paper, we consider the function f≺(H) = sup{χ(G) | G ∈ Forb≺(H)} for
ordered graphs H on at least 2 vertices. We prove that in contrast to unordered and
directed graphs, f≺(H) = ∞ for some ordered forests H. To this end we explicitly
describe several inﬁnite classes of minimal ordered forests H with f≺(H) = ∞. A
full answer to the following question remains open.
Question 1. For which ordered forests H does f≺(H) = ∞ hold?

We completely answer Question 1 for non-crossing ordered graphs H. Suppose
that H is a non-crossing ordered k-vertex graph with f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞. We prove that,
if H connected, then k − 1 (cid:54) f≺(H) (cid:54) 2k − 3 and, if H is disconnected, then
k−1 (cid:54) f≺(H) (cid:54) 2k. In addition, we give inﬁnite classes of graphs for which f≺(H) =
|V (H)|−1, as well as inﬁnite classes of graphs for which |V (H)| (cid:54) f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞. Note
that we do not know whether f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞ for the matchings in the last statement
of Theorem 4. For crossing connected ordered graphs, we reduce Question 1 to
monotonically alternating trees:
Question 2. For which monotonically alternating trees H does f≺(H) = ∞ hold?
We do not have an answer to Question 2 even for some monotonically alternating
paths. A smallest unknown such path is u5u1u3u2u4, where u1 ≺ ··· ≺ u5. See
Figure 9 (left). The situation becomes even more unclear for crossing disconnected
graphs. We do not know the value of f≺(H) for some ordered matchings H. A
smallest such matching has edges u1u3, u2u5 and u4u6 where u1 ≺ . . . ≺ u6. See
Figure 9 (right). Note that Reduction Lemmas 1, 2, 3 and 4 apply to crossing
ordered graph as well. We ﬁnd a more precise version of Reduction Lemma 2 and
other types of reductions, similar to reductions for matrices in [18], but none of
these lead to signiﬁcantly better upper bounds in Theorems 3 and 4 or a new class
of forests with ﬁnite f≺. The following question remains open, even when restricted
to non-crossing graphs.
Question 3. For k (cid:62) 4, what is the value of the function

f≺(k) = max{f≺(H) |

|V (H)| = k, f≺(H) (cid:54)= ∞}?
