Abstract

Understanding the demographics of app users is crucial, for
example, for app developers, who wish to target their adver-
tisements more effectively. Our work addresses this need
by studying the predictability of user demographics based
on the list of a user’s apps which is readily available to
many app developers. We extend previous work on the prob-
lem on three frontiers:
(1) We predict new demographics
(age, race, and income) and analyze the most informative
apps for four demographic attributes included in our analysis.
The most predictable attribute is gender (82.3 % accuracy),
whereas the hardest to predict is income (60.3 % accuracy).
(2) We compare several dimensionality reduction methods for
high-dimensional app data, ﬁnding out that an unsupervised
method yields superior results compared to aggregating the
apps at the app category level, but the best results are obtained
simply by the raw list of apps. (3) We look into the effect of
the training set size and the number of apps on the predictabil-
ity and show that both of these factors have a large impact on
the prediction accuracy. The predictability increases, or in
other words, a user’s privacy decreases, the more apps the
user has used, but somewhat surprisingly, after 100 apps, the
prediction accuracy starts to decrease.

Introduction

In 2014, 60 % of internet trafﬁc was estimated to come from
mobile devices1, of which 51 % was attributed to apps.2 As
the importance of mobile apps continues to rise, some have
even declared that “apps are the new Web”3. Though claims
of the Web’s demise are probably exaggerated, the number
of available mobile apps continues to increase and with it,
one would expect, the importance of apps for the wider Web
ecosystem.

At the same time, most academic studies looking at “on-
line users” still concentrate on website visits with, by com-
parison, much fewer attention being given to mobile apps.
In this paper, we study the predictability of six demographic
attributes based on the list of used apps.
This is a pre-print of an article appearing at ICWSM 2016.

The most apparent applications of demographic predic-
tion methods are in marketing. For instance, an app devel-
oper might be interested in understanding which user seg-
ments are underrepresented when designing new ad cam-
paigns for the app. On the other hand, computational so-
cial scientists, studying the behavior of people as observed
through an app, like Twitter, need to understand how rep-
resentative users of the app are as a sample of the whole
population.

Studying the predictability of demographics also points
out privacy implications of users allowing apps to access
their list of installed apps. Many users undoubtedly do not
carefully review the permissions that the apps they install re-
quire, and even less, understand the scope of the information
that can be inferred from the data accessible by the apps.

The only previous studies on demographic prediction
based on lists of apps, we are aware of, are (Seneviratne
et al. 2014; 2015). In the latter work, only gender predic-
tion is studied and the dataset comprises of 218 users. We
have obtained a dataset of 3 760 users, which allows us to
perform more ﬁne-grained analyses, e.g., looking into the
effect of app count on the predictability, and to obtain statis-
tically more reliable results.

Material

Our dataset contains the demographic attributes and a list
of apps for 3 760 Android users. While (Seneviratne et al.
2015) analyze the lists of installed apps, we are studying the
lists of apps used at least once within a period of one month
in 2015. Some very rarely used apps are probably missing
from the latter list, but nevertheless, the lists can be expected
to be highly correlated.

The average number of apps per user is 82.6 and the num-
ber of unique apps is 8 840. Apps with less than ten users
have been discarded to remove all personally identiﬁable in-
formation. The dataset is from Verto Analytics who have
provided us a subsample of their media-measurement panel
from the US. The panelists were recruited with the target of
getting a representative sample of the US population. Each
panelist has installed a meter app which tracks their app us-
age, and in return, the user is paid for providing the data.

Methods

When choosing a suitable prediction method, it is impor-
tant to consider the following characteristics of the dataset:
(1) feature vectors (bags–of–apps) are binary and very
sparse, (2) the number of features, 8 840, is larger than the
number of datapoints, 3 760, and (3) the dependent variables
(user demographics) can be treated categorical.

Logistic regression is a natural choice for this type of a
problem. We also tested support vector machines with dif-
ferent kernels and random forests, but both the results and
the running times were inferior. While logistic regression
can be adapted to multi-class problems, we instead bina-
rize the demographic variables and balance the classes. This
allows us to compare the predictability of different demo-
graphic variables.

Results

Next, we show results related to three different aspects of de-
mographic prediction, namely, (1) the predictability of dif-
ferent demographics, (2) the effects of the training set size
and the number of user’s apps, and (3) the effect of various
dimensionality reduction methods.

How Much is Revealed by Which Apps?
Classiﬁcation accuracies for six different demographic at-
tributes are shown in Table 1. They are computed based on a
ten-fold cross-validation, and the most predictable attribute
is gender, whereas the household income of a user is the
most difﬁcult to tell based on the list of user’s apps. The re-
sults are surprisingly similar to the AUC scores reported by
(Goel, Hofman, and Sirer 2012) who employed visited web-
sites as the features instead of apps. In their work, the at-
tributes marked with ‘*’ had a slightly different binarization
threshold compared to us. The receiver operating character-
istic for gender, given in Figure 1a, shows that for half of the
users, the gender can be predicted with a 97 % accuracy.

By studying the coefﬁcients of the logistic model, we can
analyze the contribution of individual apps to the predic-
tions. The coefﬁcients with the largest absolute values are
the most predictive ones. In Table 2, we have listed these
apps for four different demographics along with the coefﬁ-
cients, the shares and the numbers of users who have used
the app4. Many of the results are not surprising; for instance,

4Note that for a given app, the number of users, n, might vary

period tracking apps are good predictors for gender, whereas
dating apps are more informative about the marital status.

How Much Does the Size Matter?
We also study the gender prediction accuracy as a function
of the training set size in Figure 1b. An absolute improve-
ment of more than ten percents can be obtained by increas-
ing the training set size from 100 users to 2 300 users. Er-
ror bars show the standard deviations of the accuracies over
100 balanced random subsamples per given number of train
users.

(Seneviratne et al. 2015) report an accuracy of 69.8 % for
a dataset of 174 users, 50 % of which are used for train-
ing (their original dataset is 218 users but they undersam-
ple the majority class to balance the classes). To be able to
benchmark against this result, we take 300 balanced random
subsamples of 174 users and run 2-fold cross-validation for
these samples. We obtain a comparable average accuracy of
(68±5)% even though we are not using content-based fea-
tures derived from app descriptions nor numeric features as
done in (Seneviratne et al. 2015). This suggests that the bag–
of–apps features alone can provide a competitive perfor-
mance. Furthermore, these features can be extracted more
easily, without having an access to an API for scraping the
Google Play store.

A user who has installed a hundred apps probably reveals
more of herself than a user with ﬁve apps. Thus it is rel-
evant to ask, how quickly is privacy lost when the number
of apps increases. In Figure 1c, we tackle this question by
binning the users according to the number of apps they have
used and showing the prediction accuracy averaged over all
demographic attributes of all users in a bin. The standard

errors are given by(cid:112)p(1 − p)/n. The results show that the

accuracy increases by about ten percents going from 20 apps
to 100 apps but after that, somewhat surprisingly, the accu-
racy starts to decrease. To test whether the decrease is statis-
tically signiﬁcant, we perform an independent two-sample
t test with the following null hypothesis: “The overall de-
mographic prediction accuracy is not higher for the users
with 50-150 apps compared to the users with more than 150
apps.” We can reject the null hypothesis (p = 0.014), which
shows that using a lot of apps at least once per month actu-
ally increases privacy.

Dimensionality Reduction
Due to the high dimensionality of feature vectors (8 840
unique apps) we study three different dimensionality reduc-
tion approaches.

The ﬁrst method, adopted by (Seneviratne et al. 2015),
considers only the apps installed by at least 10 % of the users
(125 apps in total). With this approach the gender prediction
accuracy drops from 82.3 % to 73.6 %, and even with the
dataset of 174 users, the accuracy is decreased from 68 % to
65 %. It is important to use the full list of apps since some
of the apps might be reliable predictors even though they are
rare (think, for example, of a rare period tracking app).

ing the classes.

The second method, also adopted by (Seneviratne et al.
2015), aggregates the installed apps to category level based
on Google Play categorization. In our dataset, there are apps
from 48 categories. We take the number of apps in each
category as the features, which yields an accuracy of 74.6 %.
The third method employs the Truncated Singular Value
Decomposition (TSVD). (Hu et al. 2007) also employ
TSVD, but instead of using the SVD components directly as
features for predicting the demographics of web users, they
adopt a recommender system approach. Setting the number
of dimensions to 48, we obtain a gender prediction accuracy
of 76.9 %. This shows that rather than using the Google
Play categories of the apps, it is better to use the same num-
ber of SVD components learned in an unsupervised man-
ner. However, the performance is clearly worse compared
to not using any dimensionality reduction, and even by in-
creasing the number of SVD components, we were unable
to exceed the performance of the logistic regression with all
features, although with 500 components, the accuracy is al-
ready 81.8 %.

In conclusion, none of the explored dimensionality reduc-
tion methods helped us to improve the gender prediction ac-
curacy. We should also note that although TSVD can help
to reduce the data dimensionality to about one-tenth of the
original without losing much in accuracy, this still does not
necessarily help with the space complexity of the method.

The reason is that unlike the SVD components, the original
bag–of–apps features are very sparse and the logistic regres-
sion implementation we use5 supports sparse matrices.

Related Work

Characterizing the demographics of Twitter users has been
studied by (Mislove et al. 2011) who infer geography, gen-
der, and race of the users based on self-reported locations
and the names of the users. They ﬁnd large deviances
from the demographic distribution of the overall popula-
tion. (Duggan et al. 2015) provide a more extensive demo-
graphic comparison of ﬁve social media platforms based on
telephone interviews. (Goel, Hofman, and Sirer 2012) look
into the demographics and behavior of web users, whereas
(Weber and Jaimes 2011) study the same for search-engine
users.

The demographic prediction based on user’s apps has
been previously studied by (Seneviratne et al. 2015) who
predict the users’ gender. In their previous work (Senevi-
ratne et al. 2014), they also predict language, country, re-
lationship status, and whether the user is a parent, but in-
stead of predicting these attributes directly, they ﬁrst pre-

check whether a user has apps corresponding to a given de-
mographic attribute. We extend these works by studying
new demographics (age, race, and income), showing that
increasing the training dataset size drastically improves the
prediction accuracy, and comparing various dimensionality
reduction methods for the app data.

Others have studied demographic prediction, e.g., based
on website visits (Hu et al. 2007; Goel, Hofman, and Sirer
2012), social network features (Brea et al. 2014; Al Zamal,
Liu, and Ruths 2012), call patterns (Sarraute, Blanc, and
Burroni 2014), Twitter followers (Culotta, Ravi, and Cut-
ler 2015) and proﬁles (Chen et al. 2015), and location data
(Riederer et al. 2015). Related to demographic prediction,
(Chittaranjan, Blom, and Gatica-Perez 2013) investigate the
predictability of personality traits based on apps and other
smartphone usage features. There also was an app for pre-
dicting personality based on installed apps6.

Conclusions and Discussion

We studied the demographic prediction problem based on
the list of used apps. Large differences in the predictabil-
ity were observed between the six demographic attributes
studied in this work, gender being the most predictable and
income being the hardest to predict. The apps contribut-
ing the most to the predictions were identiﬁed for each at-
tribute, revealing some expected patterns: dating apps are
used, although not exclusively, by single people, and high-
income people are more likely to use LinkedIn, whereas
lower-income people prefer an app called Job Search.

We also studied various dimensionality reduction meth-
ods for high-dimensional app data (8 840 unique apps), ﬁnd-
ing out that SVD yields superior results compared to aggre-
gating the apps on app category level, but the best results are
obtained simply by the raw list of apps. Finally, we looked
into the effect of the training set size and the number of apps
on the predictability and showed that both of these factors
can have an impact of over 10 % on the prediction accuracy.
Interestingly, the predictability increases the more apps the
user has used, but after 100 apps, the prediction accuracy
starts to decrease. The accuracy drop from users with 50-
150 apps to users with more than 150 apps was found to be
statistically signiﬁcant.

Several interesting questions are left for future work.
First, we note that demographic attributes are most likely
not independent, and therefore, predicting the attributes si-
multaneously, employing multi-label prediction techniques,
could improve the performance. Second, we plan to study
the demographics of various popular apps to understand po-
tential biases in their userbases compared to the whole popu-
lation. Third, it would be interesting to study the usage pat-
terns of different demographic groups (as done previously
in the context of web search (Weber and Castillo 2010)) to
better understand the effects of demographic biases.
