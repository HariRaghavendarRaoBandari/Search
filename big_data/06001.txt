ABSTRACT

Detecting transient light curves (e.g., transiting planets) requires high preci-

sion data, and thus it is important to eﬀectively ﬁlter systematic trends aﬀecting

ground based wide ﬁeld surveys. We apply an implementation of the Trend

Filtering Algorithm (TFA) (Kovacs et al. 2005) to the 2MASS calibration cat-

alog and select Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) photometric time series data.

TFA is successful at reducing the overall dispersion of light curves, however it

may over ﬁlter intrinsic variables and increase “instantaneous” dispersion when

a template set is not judiciously chosen. In an attempt to rectify these issues we

modify the original literature TFA by including measurement uncertainties in its

computation, including ancillary data correlated with noise, and algorithmically

selecting a template set using clustering algorithms as suggested by various au-

thors. This approach may be particularly useful for appropriately accounting for

variable photometric precision surveys and/or combined data-sets. In summary,

our contributions are to provide a MATLAB software implementation of TFA

and a number of modiﬁcations tested on synthetics and real data, summarize

the performance of TFA and various modiﬁcations on real ground based data

sets (2MASS and PTF), and assess the eﬃcacy of TFA and modiﬁcations us-

ing synthetic light curve tests consisting of transiting and sinusoidal variables.

While the transiting variables test indicates that these modiﬁcations confer no

advantage to transit detection, the sinusoidal variables test indicates potential

improvements in detection accuracy.

Introduction

Recent technological advancements in astronomy, including the ability to store massive

amounts of observational data, have allowed astronomers to explore the time domain in

detail. These advancements have allowed for the production of detailed photometric time

series data, or “light curves”, which monitor the brightness of a stellar object on time-scales

varying from minutes to decades. The analysis of light curves has led to a prodigious

number of exoplanet discoveries in recent times; according to the NASA Exoplanet Archive,

to date over 1262 exoplanets have been detected by analyzing photometric time series data

to look for transits.

Photometric time series data obtained from wide ﬁeld surveys are aﬀected by systematic

noise from varying atmospheric conditions or uncorrected instrumental eﬀects. The ability

to intelligently ﬁlter out such systematic noise is crucial to detecting transiting planets or

variable stars, as shown by Hartman et al. (2010), and a number of methods have been

developed to mitigate their spurious eﬀects, including regularized regression, GP-regression,

principal components analysis, and unsupervised learning methods (Wang et al. 2015; Kim

et al. 2009). While these methods have been developed primarily in the context of Kepler,

our focus is that of ground based wide ﬁeld surveys, where atmospheric conditions play a

dominant role in contributing to unwanted systematic noise. The Trend Filtering Algorithm

(TFA; Kovacs et al. 2005) attempts to detrend systematic noise in light curves, and it

leverages the fact that wide ﬁeld surveys generate multiple light curves that are aﬀected

by similar systematics. Our overall research eﬀorts focused primarily on: i) implementing

this algorithm on existing photometric time series data sets from ground based wide ﬁeld

astronomical surveys and ii) investigating methods to improve its performance. We note

that TFA can also be used in the signal reconstruction phase, as is investigated by Aigrain

et al. (2015) and Foreman-Mackey et al. (2015), but do not focus on this version of TFA for

– 4 –

the purposes of our analysis.

In § 2, we brieﬂy discuss the 2MASS and PTF Orion pilot data we have applied TFA
to. In § 3, we analyze in detail the original version of TFA as well as various modiﬁcations
to TFA we have implemented. In § 4, we discuss the results of performing TFA on simulated

data sets with varying template selection procedures and two types of light curves: those

with uniform errors, and those with measurement uncertainties that vary nightly, and two

types of signals: transits and sinusoids. We also present the results of the detrending on the
aforementioned data sets. In § 5 we discuss these results and conclude.

2. Data Selection

2.1.

2MASS Data

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) is a wide ﬁeld survey which captured all

portions of the sky in three bands of the near infrared spectrum over a period of four

years, from 1997 to 2001. For each night of 2MASS operations, all of the survey telescopes

were targeted at one of 35 calibration ﬁelds every hour using the scanning strategy used

for the main survey (Plavchan et al. 2008). Over the entirety of the survey, between 562

and 3692 observations were made of each of the calibration ﬁelds. This raw data was

preprocessed using the system used to process the survey observation data (Skrutskie, M.,

et al. 2006), which detected and extracted source positions and photometry for all objects

in the images from each scan. The standard stars in each ﬁeld were used to determine

the nightly photometric zero-point solutions for each time point, in addition to seasonal

atmospheric parameters. All data extracted from these scans were stored in the 2MASS

Calibration Point Source Working Database (Cal-PSWDB), which contains more than 191

million source extractions from 73,230 scans of the 35 calibration ﬁelds (Cutri et al. 2006).

– 5 –

2.2. PTF Orion Pilot Data

Data for the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) Orion project were obtained from 40

nights of observation in December 2009 to January 2010 using the PTF camera installed at

the Palomar 48 inch telescope. The goal of the observations was to study the young 25 Ori

association (van Eyken et al. 2011). For our analyses, we used preliminary pilot test data

taken during instrument commissioning time in Feb/March 09, with the purpose of using

them to build a diﬀerential photometry pipeline. Two data sets were taken. The ﬁrst was

an overlapped tiling of the entire Orion region, R band, 30s exposures. The second was a

single-ﬁeld time-series data set, R band, 60s exposures, approximately 90s cadence, over

three nights. The aim of the program was to observe a ﬁeld where the gas disks of young

stars are actively on the point of dissipating (approximately 5–10Myr old), leaving behind

any newly formed Jovian planets. The 25 Orion region was chosen for the time-series pilot

study.

3. Analysis

In § 3.1, we begin by brieﬂy summarizing the methodology of TFA (Kovacs et al.

2005) as well as the derivation of the matrix formulation of the algorithm. In the remaining
sections, we analyze various methods of modifying TFA to improve its performance. In §

3.2 we discuss how one may include measurement uncertainties and recast this modiﬁcation
into matrix algebra. In § 3.3, we review two clustering based approaches to optimize the

selection of a template set, the ﬁrst method from Kim et al. (2009). In the ﬁnal section we

present a method of including external parameters correlated with noise known as External

Parameter Decorrelation, as in Bakos et al. (2007).

– 6 –

3.1. Formulation of TFA

We begin with the mathematical formulation of TFA Kovacs et al. (2005). Let Y (i) be

a light curve which is to be detrended, and assume it is zero averaged. TFA assumes that a

ﬁlter function F (i) may be constructed as a linear combination of “template” light curves

Xj(i) which are selected from the ﬁeld surveyed, and are zero averaged as well. Implicitly,

the template set contains all information of the systematic trends that the algorithm is

privy to. Assume there exist m light curves in the template set, and assume each light

curve consists of n brightness measurements; to summarize we have the following relations:

j=m(cid:88)

F (i) =
cjXj(i)
Y ∗(i) = Y (i) − F (i)

j=1

(1)

(2)

(3)

where Y ∗(i) is the ﬁltered light curve. Thus the formulation of a ﬁlter function is equivalent

to the solution of a particular set of constants cj. TFA solves for these constants by

minimizing the following sum of squared residuals:

i=n(cid:88)

min

(Y (i) − F (i))2

i=1

This minimization problem can be recast in terms of matrix algebra; we may arrange the

template set into an m by n matrix L where each row is a light curve. Further, consider
placing the constants {cj} into a length m row vector. Then we have the relation:

F = cL

(4)

Where F is the ﬁlter function viewed as a length n row vector. Using this new notation,

our minimization problem now becomes:

(5)
Where the ||.||2 notation is the familiar notion of Euclidean distance in Rn. In other words,
a particular choice of c corresponds to a point in the subspace spanned by the rows of L,

min||Y − cL||2

– 7 –

and we seek a choice of c such that the residual distance Y − cL is minimized. A basic
proposition from linear algebra dictates that this choice of c will cause the vector Y − cL

to be normal to the hyperplane spanned by the rowspace of L. Hence we seek c such that
the vector Y − cL is normal to all the rows of L. Since normality is deﬁned by a 0 inner

product, we get the following relation:

Hence solving for c:

L(Y − cL)T = 0

c = (LLT )−1LY T

(6)

(7)

The salient point of this derivation is that a ﬁlter function can be calculated via basic

matrix operations, making for a simple MATLAB implementation.

3.2.

Including Measurement Uncertainties

A main drawback of TFA is that is does not rely on individual measurement

uncertainties, and hence a highly uncertain measurement is treated equally to a very certain

measurement. To rectify this, one may modify the key minimization problem TFA employs

to weight certain measurements more than uncertain measurements. Speciﬁcally, we now

minimize the following weighted sum of squared residuals:

i=n(cid:88)

i=1

min

wi(Y (i) − F (i))2

(8)

. As before, we may recast this problem in terms of matrices. If we

i

where wi = σ−2
deﬁne the diagonal matrix S such that Sii = σ−2
brightness measurement, then we are minimizing the following:

i where σi is the standard error of the ith

min||(Y − cL)S||2

(9)

Since S is a linear map this is equivalent to the problem:

– 8 –

min||(Y S − cLS)||2

(10)

This is of the same form as the original TFA problem and hence the solution is given by:

Where

and

c = (GGT )−1GH T

G = LS

H = Y S

(11)

(12)

(13)

It should be noted that the involvement of measurement uncertainties is more

computationally costly than the unmodiﬁed version of TFA. With the original algorithm,

one may form a template set for an entire ﬁeld of stars and and use the same template for

each star ﬁltered. However, if one corrects by measurement uncertainties the template set

must be multiplied by S for each star ﬁltered, where S is dependent on the particular star.

Weighting by measurement uncertainties is suggested in the thesis of Pal (2009).

Another variation to consider is to choose the weights to be a function of template

measurement uncertainties in addition to uncertainties of the light curve being ﬁltered.

This is a variation we do not consider in our current analysis but could be interesting to

investigate in future work. Nonetheless when the clustering procedure described in the

next section is used, one ultimately averages over light curves in a cluster to produce an

element of the template set. This should reduce the measurement standard error associated

with the template light curves approximately on the order of square root of NC (assuming

independent and identical measurement uncertainty), where NC is the number of light

– 9 –

curves used in a particular cluster; hence the measurement uncertainty of the light curve to

be ﬁltered will be of more importance when the clustering procedure is used to produce

templates.

3.3. Optimizing the Template Set

A critical component of TFA is the selection of a template set, since it implicitly

contains all information about systematic noise. Ideally, one would like to minimize the

number of template stars while maximizing information about systematic noise. While a

large number of template stars yields a large reduction in dispersion, this also yields a

greater tendency to over ﬁlter intrinsic variables. This is because many free parameters in

the minimization problem allows for many degrees of freedom to ﬁt a particular light curve

and potentially ﬁlter intrinsic variations. We investigate two methods of optimizing the

selection of a template set, both based on clustering algorithms.

3.3.1. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

Kim et al. (2009) propose an algorithm which attempts to select a small number of

template stars that well represent systematic trends. The algorithm is, in essence, an

implementation of agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The algorithm aims to partition

stars into subsets whose light curves correlate highly with each other. The logic behind

this approach is that each cluster represents a particular sort of systematic trend. Once

partitioning is complete, one may extract a template star from each cluster by performing

a weighted average, where weighting is done by the inverse of variance.

There are three main steps involved in this algorithm. First a distance matrix is

computed for the light curves. Then, one computes a binary tree using this distance matrix.

– 10 –

Finally, one uses the binary tree to determine clusters via a merging algorithm. We detail

these steps below:

• STEP 1: Compute the Distance Matrix. First, we compute the Pearson correlation

between all light curves. We store the information in a distance matrix D where
dij = 1 − cij, where cij is the correlation between light curves i and j.

• STEP 2: Compute the Binary Tree. We then compute a binary tree using the

distance matrix. Speciﬁcally, the leaves of the tree are the individual light curves. We

then combine the closest two nodes under one parent, where the distance between two

nodes a and b is the maximum distance between any two light curves in the nodes.

We iterate this linking procedure until all light curves have been merged.

• STEP 3: Determine Clusters via Merging. Using the binary tree, one can determine

clusters in the following manner. Initially we set clusters to be nodes in the tree

with at least two children, and at each step consider merging the two closest nodes

to form a larger cluster. Call this potential cluster Cmerge; if Cmerge contains light

curves which are correlated (i.e Cmerge is a good representation of a particular

systematic trend) then the distribution of distances between any two light curves in

Cmerge should (approximately) follow a normal distribution. Hence, one applies an

Anderson-Darling normality test to the list of distances. If the test produces a p-level

below .10 (i.e, we have reason to believe the distances do not come from a normal

distribution) then we stop the merging procedure, as we have evidence that the light

curves are not all correlated with each other. In this fashion, one may partition all

light curves into subsets which are all correlated which each other. Once the clusters

are formed, one takes a weighted average of light curves in the cluster to produce a

template trend.

– 11 –

3.3.2. KMEANS Clustering

An alternate approach to clustering is the KMEANS algorithm. If one assumes that all
light curves are elements of Rn where n is the number of brightness measurement for each

light curve, then one may formulate a notion of Euclidean distance between two light curves.

Using this notion of distance, KMEANS partitions a set of light curves into k subsets where

the elements of each subset are close to each other. One begins the algorithm by assigning
k random points in Rn as centers. Next, one assigns each light curve to the center it is

closest to, and in this process we partition the set into k subsets. Then, we recalculate k

centers by choosing the average of each cluster as its center. We then iterate this process of

reassigning light curves to clusters and recalculating centers until no new assignments have

been made. A subtlety involved is the initial choice of centers, and a particularly eﬃcient

method for doing so is given by KMEANS++ (Arthur et al. 2007). Note that one must

ensure light curves are zero averaged to ensure that Euclidean distance is a feasible metric.

An additional subtlety in KMEANS is that the k must be chosen beforehand, in contrast

to the hierarchical clustering approach.

3.4. External Parameter Decorrelation

While TFA assumes one has no apriori information regarding systematic noise, it is

feasible that certain external parameters, such as seeing or position, correlate with noise.

Bakos et al. (2007) suggest a method to involve external parameters which correlate with

systematics. In essence, the formulation is the same as TFA, except coeﬃcients are now

chosen for the parameters via the same minimization problem.

– 12 –

Where Pm+1 through Pl contain the external parameters. Again, we may recast this

formulation into matrix algebra; we simply add additional rows to the template matrix T ,

where each row contains the external parameter values for each time index.

4. Results

We have written a package of MATLAB software which implements the Trend

Filtering Algorithm as well as the aforementioned extensions.1 What follows are a series

of quantitative assessments of the algorithm, using both the unmodiﬁed version and the

various modiﬁcations previously reviewed.

4.1. Simulation Studies

Before presenting the results of both the modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed versions of TFA

applied to the aforementioned data sets, we discuss two simulation studies conducted to

determine the eﬃcacy of the methodology discussed in the previous section. The ﬁrst

simulation study included injected transit signals and the second injected pulsating signals.

4.1.1.

Injected Transit Study

This simulation study consists of two sets of 432 light curves with faint transit signals of

randomly varying period length, depth and duration added to a single sinusoidal systematic.
The transit period was drawn uniformly within ± 10 % of 1,4,20,and 400 days, the depth

was either .005, .01, or .02 mag, and the transit duration fraction was either .005, .002, or

1This is freely available at https://github.com/ggopalan/MATLAB-Detrending-Software

– 13 –

.01. 2 Furthermore, each systematic had a period 1,4,20 or 400 days exactly and 3 possible

amplitudes of .005, .01 or .02 mag. The ﬁrst of these sets also includes ﬁxed measurement

errors and the second consists of measurement errors which ﬂuctuate on a nightly basis,

but are ﬁxed throughout a given night for all light curves; the periods of the transit signal

and systematic were selected to be on similar scales to allow for a particularly challenging

recovery scenario. The uniform measurement standard deviation is .01 mag, and the nightly

varying measurement standard deviation is uniformly sampled from the range .005 mag to

.015 mag for a given night. Ultimately the measurement error is drawn from a zero mean

Gaussian distribution with the associated standard deviation. In total there were 19200

measurements with 1 measurement per minute with 8 hours of observations over 40 nights.

This particular cadence was chosen to be representative of a typical ground-based transit

survey strategy. These key parameters are summarized in Table 1.

We next considered 3 template sets to ﬁlter these same sets of light curves; the ﬁrst

was a template set generated by randomly selecting 25 percent (108) of the 432 light curves

for the analysis, the second was chosen with agglomerative hierarchical clustering (the PDT

function of our MATLAB package) and the third template set was derived by randomly

selecting a set of the same cardinality as that from the agglomerative hierarchical approach

(which were 18 and 15 light curves for the uniform and nightly error synthetics). We ran

the unmodiﬁed and modiﬁed TFA (with measurement uncertainties) using these three

template sets, which resulted in 6 total ﬁltering runs. To detect whether the resultant light

curves had a transit signal we used the BLS periodogram tool (Kovacs, G. et al. 2002) to

determine if the correct transit period was detected to a statistically signiﬁcant extent,
where statistical signiﬁcance is determined by a p-value ≤ .01. To detect a signal we used

2The transit duration fraction is how long the transit lasts as a fraction of the orbital

period.

– 14 –

the highest peak if it was statistically signiﬁcant and considered a maximum of 10 integer

multiple subharmonics for signal detection.

The details of the transit detection methodology used are as follows. We search

periods between 0.5 and 40 days with periods evenly spaced in frequency. We employ

the highest peak + correct frequency criterion, and include up to M/N integer fraction
multiples (e.g., harmonics) of the correct frequency with M, N ∈ (1, 2, 3, 4). For

a peak period P1 and the true period Q, we deﬁne the correct frequency score as:
M ax(10(−10000∗M∗N∗(Log(P1)/Log(Q∗M/N )−1)2)) for M, N ∈ (1, 2, 3, 4). The 10,000*M*N

constant determines the width of range of acceptable periods about the true period or its

harmonic, with a penalty for higher harmonics. We also assess the statistical signiﬁcance of

the highest peak utilizing the lognormal distribution of periodogram power values (Akeson

et al. 2013). Secondary peaks that were statistically signiﬁcant were also investigated, but

not included since often only the highest peak is considered in typical ground-based transit

surveys.

The results of this simulation study are summarized in Table 2. The results of the

synthetics test indicate that TFA with the largest number of template trends results in

the largest number of detections. However, in both data sets TFA with the agglomerative

hierarchical clustering approach detects more transits than TFA without clustering. Overall

the detection rate of transits after applying TFA with a (relatively) small template set

yields a comparable detection rate to that of TFA applied with a (relatively) large number

of templates; it must be noted that the detection rate of transits is strictly smaller for the

modiﬁed TFA using clustering than the unmodiﬁed TFA with a randomly selected large set

of templates.

– 15 –

4.1.2.

Injected Sinusoid Study

We had conducted a second simulation study with sinusoidal signals instead of transits

using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (Scargle 1982; Zechmeister et al. 2009) instead of the

BLS algorithm for transits. As in the previous simulation study, there was an observation

every minute for 8 hours over 40 nights. Each systematic had a period 1,4,20 or 400 days

exactly and 3 possible amplitudes of .005, .01 or .02 mag. Each true sinusoidal signal had

4 possible periods selected uniformly at random within +/- 10 percent of 1, 4, 20, or 400

days and exactly 3 possible amplitudes of .005, .01, or .02 mag. Table 3 displays the results

of this test, where as before, 432 lightcurves were generated with a single systematic and

signal, and a signal was considered recovered if the period was correctly recovered with a
p-value ≤ .01. In all cases except the Pre-TFA uniform light curve set, the modiﬁed version

of TFA using clustering and uncertainty weighting recovers the most number of signals,

although our conclusions are limited by the generally small number of recovered signals.

4.2. Assessing the Unmodiﬁed Version of TFA on Real Data

4.2.1. TFA Reduces Dispersion

By visualizing dispersion versus apparent magnitude for both the 2MASS and PTF

Orion pilot data, we have determined that TFA reduces the overall dispersion of the light

curves. These graphs are depicted below in Figure 1. Speciﬁcally, the algorithm reduced

the dispersion most substantially for the PTF Orion pilot data.

– 16 –

4.2.2. TFA May Filter Intrinsic Variables

Evidence suggests that TFA may over ﬁlter intrinsic variable signals if many template

light curves are chosen. For example, consider Figure 2, which presents the original and

ﬁltered light curve for a PTF variable candidate with a template set of 50 light curves that

are arbitrarily chosen. The amplitude of the variability of the raw light curve of this source

is too large (¿0.15 mag) to be explained by systematic sources of photometric variability,

from the instrument/telescope, and/or the Earth’s atmosphere. It is also an outlier in its

photometric rms for its apparent magnitude, which also allows us to ﬂag the variations we

see as being intrinsic to the source rather than systematic. In this example it is clear that

any intrinsic variability has been ﬂattened by the ﬁltering algorithm. This light curve also

demonstrates that TFA may be increasing its “instantaneous dispersion”. In other words,

while the overall standard deviation may be reduced, the standard deviation for points

taken within a small time frame has increased, which is not a desired result.

4.3. Assessing the Modiﬁed Version of TFA on Real Data

4.3.1. Modiﬁed TFA Reduces Dispersion

It is evident that the modiﬁcations made to TFA do not mitigate its ability to reduce

the dispersion of light curves; the dispersion plots presented in Figure 1 are qualitatively

similar to dispersion plots of the unmodiﬁed version of TFA. In addition to these dispersion

plots, we have generated histograms which illustrate the distribution of dispersion

reductions.

In particular, Figure 3 present histograms of dispersion improvements.

These histograms illustrate both absolute and relative dispersion improvements. Absolute

improvement is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the dispersion of light curves post and

pre TFA. Relative dispersion improvement is deﬁned as the absolute improvement divided

– 17 –

by the pre TFA dispersion. From these histograms, we can derive quantitative measure of

the modiﬁed TFA’s performance. On average, dispersion was reduced by 30 percent for the

PTF data set and 1.5 percent for the 2MASS data set. The lack of signiﬁcant improvement

to most 2MASS light curves indicates that the data reduction for 2MASS and calibration is

thorough in removing most systematics. However, signiﬁcant improvements can be obtained

in special cases, such as extended or confused sources.

4.3.2. Modiﬁed TFA May Prevent the Overﬁltering of Intrinsic Variables

In some cases, our modiﬁed TFA no longer overﬁlters intrinsic variables.For example,

consider the detrended PTF Orion pilot light curve in Figure 2 which was previously over

ﬁltered by the unmodiﬁed version of TFA. The intrinsically variable source is essentially

unchanged. In addition, the problem of increased instantaneous dispersion is also alleviated,

although it still persists to a slight extent. This success can be most likely attributed to the

prudent selection of a few template trends. The utilization of many template curves allows

for many free parameters in the key minimization problem that TFA employs; in turn, this

allows intrinsic variations to be ﬁltered by the template curves.

5. Conclusion

After implementing TFA and applying it to the 2MASS calibration data and PTF

Orion pilot data we conclude that the algorithm substantially reduces the dispersion of light

curves, most notably for the PTF Orion pilot data set. Based on real examples from the

PTF Orion pilot data and the synthetic pusating variables test, it is also apparent that TFA

may over ﬁlter intrinsic variables and increase the instantaneous dispersion of light curves

when a template set is not carefully chosen. By modifying TFA to include measurement

– 18 –

uncertainties, include ancillary data correlated with noise, and select a template set using

clustering algorithms, we believe that these eﬀects can be mitigated. Additionally, we

believe our implementation is equipped to handle night-to-night and airmass dependent

variable photometric precision for the ﬁxed integration time ground-based surveys due

to the involvement of measurement uncertainties. Finally, we note that the MATLAB

package and documentation is freely available at https://github.com/ggopalan/MATLAB-

Fig. 1.— PTF Orion pilot and 2MASS dispersion using both the original TFA and mod-

iﬁcations. The top panel is using the unmodiﬁed version of TFA and the bottom panel is

the modiﬁed version. Black points indicate light curves before detrending, and red indicates

after detrending.

Fig. 2.— Detrended PTF Orion pilot variable candidate using the unmodiﬁed version of

TFA compared to the modiﬁed version, where the original light curve is in blue and the

light curve after ﬁltering is in red. Note that the unmodiﬁed algorithm appears to ﬁlter

intrinsic variability of the light curve which is not desired. Note that TFA is used in the

non-reconstructive mode

Fig. 3.— Histograms illustrating the distribution of absolute and relative dispersion im-

provements using the modiﬁed version of TFA. The left hand-side is in units of magnitudes,

and the right hand side in fractional improvement in dispersion as measured in magnitudes
