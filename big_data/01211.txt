Abstract

We study the motion of a particle in a particular magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration both classically

and quantum mechanically. For ﬂux-free radially symmetric magnetic ﬁelds deﬁned on circular

regions, we establish that particle escape speeds depend, classically, on a gauge-ﬁxed magnetic

vector potential, and demonstrate some trajectories associated with this special type of magnetic

ﬁeld. Then we show that some of the geometric features of the classical trajectory (perpendicular

exit from the ﬁeld region, trapped and escape behavior) are reproduced quantum mechanically

using a numerical method that extends the norm-preserving Crank-Nicolson method to problems

involving magnetic ﬁelds. While there are similarities between the classical trajectory and the

position expectation value of the quantum mechanical solution, there are also diﬀerences, and we

demonstrate some of these.

INTRODUCTION

There is a well-known problem (Problem 5.43) in [1] that asks the reader to show that if

a charged particle starts at the center of a circular (of radius R), radially-symmetric, ﬂux-

free magnetic ﬁeld region, it will exit the region (if it exits) perpendicular to the circular

boundary. This is an exercise in angular momentum conservation, and its ultimate utility

resides in running the problem backwards:

if you shoot a particle into a region with this

special magnetic ﬁeld, it will hit the center provided it enters perpendicular to the circular

boundary of the region.

Our interest in the problem begins with the determination of the critical velocity that

allows the particle to escape the ﬁeld region at all. Since there is no traditional potential

energy barrier to go over, it is not immediately obvious what sets the minimum “escape”

speed here. After we determine the condition for escape, highlighting the role of a gauge-

ﬁxed magnetic vector potential in classical mechanics, we turn to particle trajectories in

quantum mechanics.

From Schr¨odinger’s equation in a region with magnetic vector potential A, we can estab-

lish that the expectation value of position satisﬁes the following ODE (see [2] Problem 4.59,

(2)

and the expectation value (cid:104)v(cid:105) would be directly comparable to the classical velocity. For
magnetic ﬁelds that are not constant, the right-hand side of (1) deﬁnes an exotic eﬀective
force, one which is very diﬀerent from q (cid:104)v(cid:105) × B (as we shall see). As an equation of

expectation value of position is quite diﬀerent from the classical position vector for these

magnetic trajectories, and there are other diﬀerences as well. If the equation of motion for

the expectation value of position was (2), we would expect the “speed” (the magnitude of
(cid:104)v(cid:105) here) to be constant, just as it is classically. But the eﬀective force on the right of (1)
does not lead to a constant magnitude for the expectation value of velocity.

There are also similarities between the classical trajectories and the position expectation

value of quantum mechanical solutions – we will use a numerical solution of Schr¨odinger’s

equation to show that the expectation value of kinetic energy is constant (as it should be

for motion in a magnetic ﬁeld), and we can also establish that certain geometric properties

of the quantum mechanical trajectory are shared with the classical trajectory: the particle

exits the ﬁeld region perpendicular to the boundary, and we can get both “bound” motion,

and “escape” trajectories. The diﬀerence between the trajectory-based “speed”,(cid:112)(cid:104)v(cid:105) · (cid:104)v(cid:105)
and the kinetic energy “speed”,(cid:112)(cid:104)v · v(cid:105) is the main distinction between the classical and

quantum mechanical trajectories, but it is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence.

II. ESCAPE SPEED

The Lagrangian for a particle moving in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld is:

L =

1
2

m v · v + q v · A,

(3)

where A is the magnetic vector potential. The canonical momentum is then p ≡ ∂L
m v + q A. The Legendre transform of the Lagrangian deﬁnes the Hamiltonian:

∂v =

H = v · p − L =

1

2 m

(p − q A) · (p − q A) .

(4)

We know that the Hamiltonian is conserved, and that the speed of the particle is also a

constant of the motion (typical of motion in magnetic ﬁelds, which do no work).

For our target problem, the magnetic ﬁeld points in the ˆz direction, and we’re interested
in motion occurring in the x − y plane (we will set the initial velocity to lie in this plane).
The magnetic vector potential takes the general form: A = A(s) ˆφ (its magnitude depends

only on s, similar to the magnetic ﬁeld itself). In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian is

H =

1

2 m (cid:20)p2

s +

1
s2 p2

φ + q2 A2 − 2

q
s

pφ A(cid:21) ,

(5)

and we can immediately identify the conserved pφ (angular momentum) from the equation

of motion:

∂φ = 0. The magnetic vector potential acts as a momentum, and we
have to be careful to separate the velocity portion of the canonical momentum, m v (with

˙pφ = − ∂H

its constant magnitude), from the potential part.

In order to untangle the two, at least

initially, we’ll take A(0) = 0, and give the particle initial speed v0 (in the ˆx direction). Since
we are starting at the origin, we’ll pick the constant pφ = 0 (to avoid the 1/02 and 1/0 that

would appear in H otherwise).

3

Under these simplifying (but reasonable) assumptions, the initial value of the Hamiltonian

is:

E =

1
2

m v2
0,

just the kinetic energy of the particle at t = 0. At any other time, we have

(6)

(8)

so that

1

E =

2 m (cid:2)p2

s + q2 A2(cid:3) ,
ps = ±(cid:112)(m v0)2 − (q A)2.

Because of the form of A (which points in the ˆφ direction), the radial momentum is ps = m ˙s,
and we can solve (8) for ˙s,

˙s = ±(cid:115)v2

0 −(cid:18)q A
m(cid:19)2

.

(9)

The value of ˙s cannot be imaginary (when ˙s = 0, all of the motion occurs in the ˆφ direction),

and so this relation provides precisely the desired “escape speed” – if a particle is to exit

the ﬁeld region, it must have

v0 ≥

q Amax

m

(10)

where Amax is the maximum vector potential magnitude over the domain.

What do we make of the fact that if we take v0 less than this escape speed, there will be

imaginary values for ˙s? The particle never gets to those regions – when ˙s = 0, the particle

turns around, so that all of the motion will occur within a circle of radius ¯s deﬁned by the
value of A at which v0 = q A(¯s)

m . The escape speed in (10) uses the maximum value of A in

order to overcome all such constraining circles.

III. FLUX-FREE FIELDS

The escape speed depends on the magnitude of the vector potential, but the vector

potential has gauge freedom, how do we know that the maximum “height” is being pinned
down to a unique value? So far, we have required that A = A(s) ˆφ, appropriate for a

radially symmetric magnetic ﬁeld pointing in the ˆz direction, in Coulomb gauge. We also

took A(0) = 0 in order to set the initial particle angular momentum to zero.

4

For ﬂux-free ﬁelds (over the domain of the disk of radius R), there is an additional

requirement:

and for our form for A, this reads

0 =(cid:90) B · da =(cid:73) A · d(cid:96),
0 =(cid:90) 2π

0

A(R) R dφ = 2 π R A(R),

(11)

(12)

which means that A(R) = 0. What could we add to A that preserves these basic require-
ments? The gradient of a function f could be added to A, A → A + ∇f , yielding the
same magnetic ﬁeld. But, if we are to remain in Coulomb gauge, f must be a harmonic
function, ∇2f = 0. The ﬂux-free boundary condition imposes the additional requirement
that f is independent of φ (else we can’t get ∇f = 0 at R for all φ), so we are left with
f = a log(s/s0) for constant a and s0, which will not allow us to set the boundary condition
at s = 0 (∇f|s=0 = 0) unless a = 0. So in this case, the gauge is fully ﬁxed, and that’s what
allows us to unambiguously identify an escape speed.

We can also use this A(R) = 0 requirement to solve the original problem posed in [1] –

from (9), we have, at R:
of it in the ˆφ direction, the particle exits the region radially.

˙s = v0, so that all of the velocity is in the ˆs direction, with none

ﬁeld of magnitude B0.

Here, we can determine the escape speed, q Amax/m, analytically – the maximum of the

potential occurs at s = R/2 where the magnitude is B0 R/8. For initial speeds less than this,

5

we will get bound trajectories, and for initial speeds greater than this, the particle will exit

the ﬁeld region perpendicular to the boundary. Examples are shown in Figure 1, in which

we plot two bound trajectories together with their bounding circles (of radius ¯s obtained by
solving v0 = q A(¯s)

m for ¯s), and the trajectory for a particle that escapes. These trajectories

were generated using a standard fourth-order Runge-Kutta solver.

calculated (by solving q A(¯s)/m = v0 for ¯s) and is shown in green. For the bottom plot, v0 is above

the escape speed, and the particle exits perpendicular to the boundary.

A. Numerical Method

We’ll use a norm-preserving modiﬁcation of Crank-Nicolson, developed in [4]. The idea

is to use ﬁnite diﬀerence to generate forward and backward Euler methods (as with the

usual Crank-Nicolson, see, for example [5]) but in a way that preserves the Hermiticity of

the discrete Hamiltonian. To deﬁne the elements of the method, introduce a grid in (the

dimensionless) ¯x and ¯y: ¯xj = j ∆ and ¯yk = k ∆ for constant spacing ∆. We’ll also discretize
in time, ¯tn = n ∆¯t. Let ¯Ψn
jk (the
magnetic vector potential is time-independent here). Using ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations

jk = ¯Ax(¯xj, ¯yk) and similarly for ¯Ay

jk = ¯Ψ(¯xj, ¯yk, ¯tn), with ¯Ax

to the derivatives in (17), with a forward Euler approximation for the temporal derivative

gives

Suppose our spatial grid has N points in both the ¯x and ¯y directions, then we can embed

the spatial values of ¯Ψ, at time level n, in a vector of length N 2:

Ψn ˙≡



(21)

so that given the ¯x and ¯y grid locations, j and k (respectively), the index in Ψn is: g(j, k) =
(k − 1) N + j. Using these spatial vectors, the Euler update above can be written as a
matrix-vector product, deﬁning H from the details of the right-hand-side of (20):

Ψn+1 = (I + i ∆¯t H) Ψn.

(22)

8

From its deﬁnition, H† = H, it is Hermitian by construction. Similarly, backwards Euler
takes the form:

and the Crank-Nicolson method is then deﬁned by

(I − i ∆¯t H) Ψn+1 = Ψn,

∆¯t H(cid:19) Ψn+1 =(cid:18)I +

i ∆¯t H(cid:19) Ψn.

(23)

(24)

This method is norm-preserving, and can be used with our initial wave function, projected

onto the grid, to develop the nth update:

Ψn =(cid:32)(cid:20)I − i

∆¯t H(cid:21)−1 (cid:20)I +

Ψ0.

(25)

Implicit in the method is that the wave function must be zero at the boundary of the
numerical domain (that allows us to set the values of ¯Ψ at the boundaries, the 0 and N + 1

points, in (20)) – our problem is immersed in an inﬁnite square box in Cartesian coordinates.

VI. COMPARISON

We chose to make the spatial grid with N = 200 points in each direction, extending from
−10 to 10 (in dimensionless length). Our (dimensionless) time step was ∆¯t = .01, and we
took ¯p = 4 in the initial wave function – that tells us roughly how many steps it would take
to get the position expectation value of a free Gaussian to hit the edge of the domain: ∼ 250
steps. In order to probe the behavior inside the ﬁeld region, we took ¯R = 2 so that a free
Gaussian’s position expectation value would leave the region in ∼ 50 time steps. To choose
¯a, note that the standard deviation for a free Gaussian is

σ =(cid:114) 1

4 ¯a2 + ¯a2 ¯t2,

(26)

and we would like the rate of spreading to be small compared to the expectation value of

momentum, so that roughly: ¯a < ¯p. The initial expectation value of momentum is numer-

ically determined (even though ¯p is speciﬁed, we may or may not capture it numerically),

and that determination is sensitive to the choice of ¯a – if the initial Gaussian is too sharply

peaked, there will not be enough representation on the grid to numerically integrate the ex-
pectation value accurately. We found that ¯a = 1 led to (cid:104)¯p(cid:105) = 3.86, an initial error of ∼ 4%

9

approximate

(given that ¯p = 4) due to: 1. the ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation to the derivative (needed to

i ∇), and 2. the use of a simple box-sum to approximate the expectation value
integrals. The choice ¯a = 1 also localized the particle inside the ﬁeld region – the probability
of ﬁnding the particle within the circle of radius ¯R was, numerically, .9997 at ¯t = 0.

With these choices in place, we used the Crank-Nicolson method described above to move

the initial Gaussian forward in time with α = 5. The method preserved norm very well – the

diﬀerence between the max and min total probability over the time of numerical solution

was ∼ 10−13. After running for ∼ 60 steps, the expectation value of position indicated

that the particle had left the ﬁeld region, and a plot of that exit is shown in Figure 2. The

velocity vector at exit makes an angle of ∼ 1.6 (radians) with ˆφ at the location of exit, so the
velocity vector is roughly perpendicular to the boundary, with an error of ∼ 2% (equivalent
in size to the initial error in the expectation value of momentum). The expectation value

and a simple box sum for the integration) has max-minus-min value of 10−14 over the ﬁrst
60 times steps, so that energy is conserved well here.

(using ﬁnite

diﬀerence to approximate the time-derivative), and from that we can compute the “speed”
of the particle (the magnitude of (cid:104)v(cid:105)) – that is also shown in Figure 2. The speed is not
constant, but diﬀerence over the range in question is still within ∼ 4%, so it is not clear if
this is just the original error or if the speed is truly ﬂuctuating.

From the expectation value of position, we can also generate d2(cid:104)x(cid:105)

dt2 using ﬁnite diﬀerence
for the temporal derivative, and we can compare that with the eﬀective force deﬁned by

the right-hand-side of (1). We can also establish that the eﬀective force deﬁned by the
right-hand-side of (2) (namely q (cid:104)v(cid:105)(t) × B((cid:104)x(cid:105)(t))) is not the one generating the motion
here by computing it explicitly – in Figure 3, we plot the left-hand-side of (1) as a function

of time (the curve shown in the plot connects the tips of these force vectors), together

with the eﬀective forces from the right-hand-sides of (1) and (2).

It is clear that while

the correspondence between the left and right-hand sides of (1) (the solid and dashed lines

in Figure 3) is not perfect, the eﬀective force deﬁned by (1) is far closer to governing the
dynamics of (cid:104)x(cid:105) than the eﬀective force deﬁned by (2).

To exhibit “bound” behavior, we raise the height of the magnetic “barrier”, taking α = 40

and leaving everything else the same. The resulting trajectory is shown in the top panel

of Figure 4 (here we take 75 steps) – this time, the “speed” of the particle is not constant
(shown in the lower panel of Figure 4), yet the energy remained constant to within 10−12
(meaning the diﬀerence of the maximum value and minimum value of energy over the time-

scales shown in the position expectation value plot). This is fundamentally diﬀerent behavior

than the classical case and comes from the fact that the notion of “speed” in quantum

mechanics has two diﬀerent interpretations – there is the magnitude of the expectation value

of velocity,(cid:112)(cid:104)v(cid:105) · (cid:104)v(cid:105) which is not constant, and alternatively(cid:112)(cid:104)v · v(cid:105) which is constant.

In classical mechanics, there is no distinction to be made.

We can once again compare the “forces” deﬁned by (1) and (2) in the trapped case –

those are shown in Figure 5, and again we see that the left and right-hand sides of (1) are
better matched than the left-hand side of (1) and the ﬁctitious q (cid:104)v(cid:105)×B (the right-hand side

dashed line is the expectation value found on the right-hand side of (1), and the dotted line is the

value of q (cid:104)v(cid:105) × B.

of (2)). These force expectation values introduce additional error, above and beyond the

discretization error in the Crank-Nicolson method itself, because of the approximations to

both derivatives and integrals needed to evaluate them, so we don’t expect perfect matches.

While there are numerical errors associated both with the Crank-Nicolson method and

the calculation of expectation values, there is an implicit physical diﬀerence between the

quantum mechanical problem and the classical one. Our numerical method required that

the wave function vanish at the edges of our square domain, we put an inﬁnite square well

around the domain to keep the particle localized. There is no such constraining force in

the classical problem – nor would the constraining force play much of a role there – if we

conﬁned the classical trajectory to live in a box of side length 5 R (where R is the radius of the

ﬁeld region), and we considered trapped motion, the boundary would never be probed. The

quantum mechanical eﬀect of the boundary is very diﬀerent – there is non-zero probability of

ﬁnding the particle outside the magnetic ﬁeld region, even for cases in which the expectation

value of position remains inside the ﬁeld region, and that “external” portion of the wave

function reﬂects oﬀ of the boundary. Because our expectation values are integrated over the

entire domain, those boundary eﬀects get transmitted to the dynamics of the expectation

value. We have attempted to minimize this contribution to our problem by placing the

boundaries far away, and keeping the initial Gaussian localized within the ﬁeld region – but

the boundaries do put a bound on how long we expect to be able to compare the classical

and quantum trajectories.

VII. CONCLUSION

The motion of particles in the presence of magnetic ﬁelds is complicated – few closed-form

solutions exist, and while we can say quite a bit about the behavior of particles moving in

magnetic ﬁelds, the trajectories themselves require numerical solution, even classically. The

situation is worse quantum mechanically – even constant magnetic ﬁelds prove diﬃcult to

handle – solving Schr¨odinger’s equation for such ﬁelds, starting from a reasonable initial

symmetric ﬂux-free ﬁelds, particles will escape the circular ﬁeld region provided their initial

speed is larger than the “escape” speed set by the magnetic vector potential. We generated

escape speed matches its theoretical prediction. That prediction relied on a completely

gauge-ﬁxed magnetic vector potential in Coulomb gauge – it would be interesting to explore

the eﬀect of other gauge choices.

On the quantum mechanical side, we extended Crank-Nicolson to handle magnetic ﬁelds

while retaining the norm-preservation of the method. Using a linear, ﬂux-free magnetic

ﬁeld, we veriﬁed that the behavior of the position expectation value matches the classical

trajectories in the following ways: 1. Particles exit perpendicular to the boundary of the

ﬁeld region, and 2. Trajectories can remain inside the ﬁeld region or escape, depending on

the relation of the initial momentum to the ﬁeld strength [6]. We also veriﬁed that the

expectation value of energy remains constant, agreeing with the classical result, and yet

classically, energy conservation means that the speed of the particle is constant (since the

only energy is kinetic) – for the quantum mechanical particle, however, the speed(cid:112)(cid:104)v(cid:105) · (cid:104)v(cid:105)
is not constant, even though the energy is (so that(cid:112)(cid:104)v · v(cid:105) is constant).

In the case of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, our classical intuition can be used to predict

the behavior of quantum mechanical expectation values, basically because the dynamical
variable (cid:104)v(cid:105) appears in (2) just as v appears in the Lorentz force law (and indeed, we recover
circular motion with predictable radius and constant speed using our initial Gaussian and

a constant magnetic ﬁeld for Ψ solved using our numerical Crank-Nicolson method). For

the more complicated ﬂux-free magnetic ﬁeld considered here, our classical intuition does

not help us, because the eﬀective force on the right-hand side of (1) involves p and B

inside the expectation value – roughly speaking, we are looking at an eﬀective force of the
form q(cid:104)v × B(cid:105) rather than q (cid:104)v(cid:105) × B, diﬀerent eﬀective forces, leading to demonstrably
diﬀerent dynamics. In the context of Ehrenfest’s theorem (see, for example [2], the informal

statement is that “quantum mechanical expectation values obey classical laws”), while (1)

does give us a classical “law” like Newton’s second law, the force on the right is unfamiliar,

and not directly comparable to the Lorentz force law.

It would be interesting to try to

generate a classical analogue to the quantum mechanical eﬀective force in (1) so that a

direct comparison of the classical (under the inﬂuence of a modiﬁed “eﬀective” force) and

quantum trajectories was possible [7].

[3] This is an example of Ehrenfest’s theorem. The proof of this type of identity comes directly

from calculating the expectation value of velocity and taking the time-derivative of it, then

employing Schr¨odinger’s equation to remove the time-derivatives of ψ that naturally appear.

[6] although unlike the classical motion, it is diﬃcult to determine, given the magnitude of B,

exactly what initial momentum will lead to bound motion or escape. It would be interesting to

estimate the “escape speed” for the quantum mechanical problem, although this is much more

diﬃcult than its classical analogue because of the diﬀerent behaviors of (cid:112)(cid:104)v · v(cid:105), (cid:112)(cid:104)v(cid:105) · (cid:104)v(cid:105)

and (cid:104)E(cid:105) itself, which is not just the kinetic piece for a Gaussian initial wave function ((cid:104)E(cid:105) also
depends on a in (18)).

[7] There should be a transition from quantum mechanical behavior to classical in some regime

(of angular momentum, say), allowing for a convergence of our two eﬀective “forces”, and the

details of that convergence would be interesting to probe.
