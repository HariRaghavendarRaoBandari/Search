Internal Model Based Active Disturbance Rejection

Control

Jinwen Pan and Yong Wang*∗

March 14, 2016

Abstract

1 The basic active disturbance rejection control (BADRC) algorithm with only one order higher externed state
observer (ESO) proves to be robust to both internal and external disturbances. An advantage of BADRC is
that in many applications it can achieve high disturbance attenuation level without requiring a detailed model of
the plant or disturbance. However, this can be regarded as a disadvantage when the disturbance characteristic
is known since the BADRC algorithm cannot exploit such information. This paper proposes an internal model
based ADRC (IADRC) method, which can take advantage of knowing disturbance characteristic to achieve perfect
estimation of the disturbance under some mild assumptions. The eﬀectiveness of the proposed method is validated
by comprehensive simulations and comparisons with the BADRC algorithm.

Introduction

Rejecting unknown disturbances in dynamical systems is a fundamental control problem with various applications
such as friction compensation during stick slip motion [1], disturbance reduction in gyroscopes [2, 3], active noise
control [4], sinusoidal disturbances rejection of vibrating structures [5, 6], control of robot manipulators [7], rotating
mechanisms control [8], and nano-positioning [9, 10]. This problem is usually solved by applying the internal model
principle (IMP) for which a general solution is given in [11] in the case of linear systems. The IMP states that if
the disturbance model can be accurately obtained and embedded in the controller, the disturbance can be entirely
canceled. On the other hand, when there is no information available about the disturbance, IMP is no longer eﬀective.
Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) was proposed by Han [12] as an alternative paradigm for control
system design [13,14], and since it is a model–free approach, it has the inherent advantages of rejecting nonlinearities,
uncertainties and disturbances. Fruitful simulation results as well as the experimental results have been reported in
various applications [15–19]. In these applications, the unknown parts (unknown nonlinearities, uncertainties and
external disturbances) are treated as a total disturbance and estimated by an extended state observer (ESO). It has
been proven that if the total disturbance or its ﬁrst derivative is bounded, the estimate error is bounded and can be
arbitrarily reduced [20]. However, the ESO has some limitations: (1) if the total disturbance is not a constant, the
estimate error can only be bounded but not zero; (2) the disturbance information cannot be used. An example given
in [21] shows that perfect estimation of even a simple sinusoidal disturbance cannot be achieved by basic ESO.

In this paper, we will propose an internal model based active disturbance rejection control (IADRC) in consid-
eration of the disturbance information. The disturbance is separated into two parts, which are the part that can
be modeled and the part that cannot be modeled. The former part is estimated by a disturbance observer with
estimate error exponentially converging to zero. The unmodeled part with unknown nonlinearities and uncertainties
are together treated as an extended state (total disturbance) of the system and estimated using ESO with a bounded
error. It is shown that the modeled part is captured perfectly and the unmodeled part is regarded as a constant

during the estimation and compensation from the IMP point of view. It is also illustrated that the performance of
BADRC is improved signiﬁcantly by IADRC when the disturbance information is used, and the more we know about
the disturbance, the better IADRC performs.

The remainder is organized as follows. The problem statement is described in section 2. In section 3, a special
class of disturbance that can be modeled as an output of a fully excited linear system is considered. Two adaptive
estimation algorithms for the disturbance are proposed based on the known disturbance information. The IADRC is
designed and analyzed in section 4. Simulation examples are given in section 5, and conclusions are drawn in section
6.

2 Problem formulation

Consider the nonlinear single-input-single-output system

(cid:26) ˙¯x = ¯A¯x + ¯f (¯x, ω1) + ¯b (u + ω2)

¯y = ¯c¯x

,

(1)

with the state vector ¯x = [x1, x2,··· , xn]T, the control input u ∈ R, shift matrix ¯A ∈ Rn×n, fn(¯x, ω1) an entirely
unknown nonlinear smooth function, and ¯f (¯x, ω1) = [0,··· , 0, fn (¯x, ω1)]T. ¯b = [0,··· , 0, bn]T with bn a known
constant, ω1, ω2 ∈ R are bounded unknown time-varying disturbances and ¯c = [1, 0,··· , 0]. System (1) can be
rewritten as

(cid:26) ˙x = Ax + b (u + d2) + f

,

(2)

where A ∈ R(n+1)×(n+1), b =(cid:2)¯bT, 0(cid:3)T

xn+1 deﬁned as

, c = [¯c, 0], x =(cid:2)¯xT, xn+1

y = cx

(cid:3)T

xn+1 = fn (¯x, ω1) + bn (ω2 − d2) .

and f = [0,··· , 0, ˙xn+1]T with the extended state

d2 is part of the matched disturbance ω2 that has some known information. The total matched disturbance d is
deﬁned as d = d1 + d2, where d1 := xn+1/bn, and d2 is the output of following system

(cid:26) ˙w = Sw,

d2 = hTw
with w ∈ Rs and w0 is selected that w are fully excited.

w (0) = w0

,

(3)

Remark 1 The extended state xn+1 that is entirely unknown can be viewed as the lumped unknown disturbance
consisting of unknown nonlinearities, uncertainties of the plant and unknown part of external disturbances. d1 can
be considered as part of the total matched disturbance that is entirely unknown.

For the system and the disturbances, we have the following assumptions,

A. 1 fn(¯x, ω1) is unknown, but
constant.

˙fn(¯x, ω1) or fn(¯x, ω1) is bounded with fn(0, 0) = C1 where C1 is an unknown

A. 2 The matrix S has no zero eigenvalues.

A. 3 h is an unknown constant vector.

A. 4 The matrix S is entirely known.

A. 5 The matrix S is unknown, but s, the dimension of S is known.

Our problem is to design an output feedback controller to stabilize the origin with the ability to reject the
disturbance d2 exponentially (thus perfectly) when ω1 = 0 by making full use of the known information of the
external disturbance and simultaneously to reject d1 in the frame of ADRC.

3 Disturbance observer design and analysis

The idea is as follows. we use an ESO to estimate the internal uncertainty and a disturbance observer to estimate
the external disturbance exponentially, and then compensate the total disturbance.

If the external disturbance does not exist in system (1), that is, d2 = 0 in system (2). In this case, the extended

state observer can be designed as

(4)
where p, l ∈ Rn+1 and l is chosen such that A− lc is Hurwitz. It is diﬃcult to estimate the real states because of the
unknown disturbance d. A − lc and S have exclusive eigenvalues for that we have assumption A.1 and the selection
of l, so unique solution Q ∈ R(n+1)×s of the following Sylvester equation

˙p = Ap + bu + l (¯y − cp) ,

QS = (A − lc) Q + bhT,

for a given S exists [22]. By deﬁning q := Qw, (5) implies

˙q = (A − lc) q + bd2.

(5)

(6)

Remark 2 Since h is unknown, no matter whether S is known or not, the solution Q cannot be obtained from (5),
and the observer (6) is unimplementable for that d2 is unknown.

In order to obtain p and q, we have the following lemma [23].

Lemma 1 The state variable x can be expressed as

x = p + q + ε,

where p is from (4) with q from (6) and ε satisfying

˙ε = (A − lc)ε.

(7)

The state estimation is solved if an estimate of q is obtained. Considering (6), the problem to be solved is to

estimate the states and unknown input to a minimum phase linear dynamic system.
In order to design the disturbance observer, a reformulation of the system (3) is ﬁrst introduced. A controllable
pair (F, g) with F ∈ Rs×s Hurwitz and g ∈ Rs are selected. For a matrix S satisfying A.2 which also implies the
pair (S, Q(1)) observable, there exists a non-singular M ∈ Rs×s satisfying the following Sylvester equation [22]

M S − F M = gQ(1),

where Q(i) denotes the i-th row of Q. Let η := M w which implies

˙η = Foη,

where

and ψT

1 = Q(1)M−1. In the new coordinate η, q and d2 can be expressed as

Fo = M SM−1 = F + gψT
1 ,

where ΨT = QM−1 = [ψ1, ψ2, ψ3,··· , ψn+1]T, and

q = ΨTη,

d2 = ψT

u η,

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

with ψT

u = hTM−1.

From (10) and (11), we know that if an estimate of η is provided and ψ, ψu are obtained, the estimate of q and

d2 are obtained, thus the state estimation is solved. From (8) and Lemma 1, we have

˙η = F η + g (¯y − p1 − ε1) ,

where p1 = p(1) and ¯y = x1, indicating that the observer for η should be designed as

˙ξ = F ξ + g (¯y − p1) .

(12)

Deﬁne eη := η − ξ. We have ˙eη = F eη − gcε, which together with (7) imply

Since F and A − lc are both Hurwitz, eη converges to zero exponentially.

How to get ψ and ψu depends on whether S is known or not. From q and d2 in (10) and (11) to the observer (6),

we have

(13)

From (13), we know that if ψ1 is obtained, then Ψ and ψu are obtained. We will show how to get ψ1 based on S.

Case 1: The matrix S is entirely known.
Since M is non-singular, from (9), we know that the matrix Fo has the same eigenvalues with the matrix S and

then ψ1 can be obtained. Without losing generality, F and g are selected as
F = A − bαF , g = [0, 0,··· , 0, 1]T.

The characteristic polynomial coeﬃcients of S and F are

αS = [α0, α1,··· , αs−2, αs−1]T,
αF = [f0, f1,··· , fs−2, fs−1]T,

thus

ψ1 = αF − αS.

Then ψi, i = 2,··· , n + 1 and ψu are computed from (13). Therefore, the external disturbance is estimated as

ˆd2 = ψT

u ξ.

To have a summarization, when S is known, we can get ˆd2 with following steps:

Procedure 1:

S1. Select F and g with the form (14) and determine αS and αF ;
S2. Compute ψ1 using (15) and ψi, i = 2,··· , n + 1 and ψu using (13);
S3. Obtain the ξ using (12);

S4. Get ˆd2 using (16).

(14)

(15)

(16)

Case 2: The matrix S is unknown, but s, the dimension of S is known
In this case, we know that ψ1 ∈ Rs. Since S is unknown, we cannot obtain ψ1 through Procedure 1. Suppose

that ˆψ1 is the estimate of ψ1, then ζ, the estimate of ξ is updated by

˙ζ = F ζ + g ˆψT

1 ξ.

so e and ˜ψ1 is bounded and from the well known Barbalat Lemma we know that lim

t→∞ e (t) = 0.

Since ψ1 is unknown, we cannot get Pc, and the updating law (18) is not implementable. Suppose that Pc is of

the form

Pc = diag{P1, γ1P1, γ2P2},

where P1 and P2 are positive deﬁnite matrices satisfying

F TP1 + P1F = −2Q1,

(19)

with Q1 and Q2 selecting as positive deﬁnite matrices and γ1 and γ2 are positive constant. Thus Qc can be selected
as

Remark 4 In (26), the input to get v is uc rather than u, which is reasonable for that the external disturbance d2
is compensated and uc can be seen as the feedback control when there is no disturbance.

Closed-loop system stability analysis: We consider the stability of the original system (2) under the control

results are shown in Figs.1 and 2. In Fig.1, x1a and x2a are states with respect to (w.r.t) the BADRC while x1m
and x2m are states w.r.t the proposed IADRC. Fig.1 shows that the proposed algorithm can reject the unknown
disturbance more eﬀective than the BADRC. Fig.2 reveals the reason: by exploiting the known information of the
disturbance, the perfect estimation of d2 is achieved while there exists a phase lag when the disturbance is estimated
only by using ESO.

We then consider the case S is unknown. With Procedure 2, we select F =

converges to its real value [−2, 3]T as shown in Fig.5. The total matched disturbance d is perfectly estimated thus
being fully compensated, therefore the system states converges to zero at the steady state shown in Fig.3.

A more complex case is considered here. Suppose that f2(x, ω1) = x2

40 t), therefore d1 = f2/b2 + σ0
and d2 = r sin(σt + ϕ). S is unknown and parameters are chosen the same as above. Results are shown in Figs.6, 7
and 8. Since x3 = f2 + b2σ0 is not a constant, as shown in Fig.7 no perfect tracking for d1 can be reached, which
leads to the estimates of ψ1 oscillating around its true value in a small region as shown in Fig.8. Therefore, there
exists oscillation in system states around 0 as shown in Fig.6.

6 Conclusions

The principle of ADRC from the internal model principle point of view was presented in this paper. An improved
ADRC that can properly exploit known information about the disturbance was proposed. Depending on whether
the dynamics of S is known or not two adaptation algorithms were provided. Moreover, it was shown that when S
is unknown, it is required to estimate it, whereas the system states are the only elements that need to be estimated
when S is known. Simulation results show that IADRC is of signiﬁcant improvement compared to the BADRC.
