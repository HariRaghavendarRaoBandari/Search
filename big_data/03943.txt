Quantum Phase Transition in the Finite Jaynes-Cummings Lattice Systems

Institut f¨ur Theoretische Physik and IQST, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, Universit¨at Ulm, D-89069 Ulm, Germany

Myung-Joong Hwang and Martin B. Plenio

Phase transitions are commonly held to occur only in the thermodynamical limit of large number of system
components. Here we exemplify at the hand of the exactly solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model and its gen-
eralization to ﬁnite JC-lattices that ﬁnite component systems of coupled spins and bosons may exhibit quantum
phase transitions (QPT). For the JC-model we ﬁnd a continuous symmetry-breaking QPT, a photonic conden-
sate with a macroscopic occupation as the ground state and a Goldstone mode as a low-energy excitation. For
the two site JC-lattice we show analytically that it undergoes a Mott-insulator to superﬂuid QPT. We identify
as the underlying principle of the emergence of ﬁnite size QPT the combination of increasing atomic energy
and increasing interaction strength between the atom and the bosonic mode which allows for the exploration of
an increasingly large portion of the inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space of the bosonic mode. This suggests that
ﬁnite system phase transitions will be present in a broad range of physical systems.

Introduction.— Quantum phase transition (QPT) and spon-
taneous symmetry breaking are fundamental concepts in
physics that lie at the heart of our understanding of various
aspects of nature, e.g., phases of matter such as magnetism
and superconductivity [1, 2] or the generation of mass [3, 4]
in high energy physics. A second-order QPT is characterised
by a closing spectral gap and degenerate ground states with a
spontaneously broken symmetry. A QPT is typically held to
occur only in the thermodynamical limit, i.e. a system with a
diverging number of constituent particles or lattice sites [1].
A ﬁnite system size generally opens the spectral gap, lifts
the ground state degeneracy and restores the symmetry of the
ground state [5, 6].

A notable exception is a recent ﬁnding in Ref. [7] concern-
ing the Rabi model [8–12], which describes a single-mode
cavity ﬁeld coupled to a two-level atom. While the Dicke
model, a N-atom generalization of the Rabi model, has long
been known for having a QPT for N → ∞ [13, 14], Ref. [7]
demonstrates that the Rabi model itself undergoes a QPT with
the same universal properties when the ratio η of the transi-
tion frequency to the cavity frequency diverges [11, 15, 16].
The study [7] further corroborates the duality between the sys-
tem size N and the frequency ratio η by showing that the
ﬁnite-size scaling exponents for η are identical to those for
N [17, 18]. It is then urgent and important task to see if reach-
ing a limit of the QPT for a system of ﬁnite components is a
principle that is generally applicable to photonic (phononic)
systems with different underlying symmetries, phases, and di-
mensions.
If positively answered, it could open up an im-
portant possibility of experimentally investigating the critical
phenomena, both in and out of equilibrium, in a small and
fully-controlled quantum system.

In this letter, we consider the Jaynes-Cummings (JC)
model [19], the Rabi model without the so-called counter-
rotating terms, which due to its U (1) symmetry is exactly
solvable. We ﬁrst point out that the well-known analytical
solution of the JC model exhibits a ground state instability in
the η → ∞ limit, in the sense that the ground state can lower
its energy indeﬁnitely by increasing its photon occupation. In
this unstable regime, we derive the analytical solution for the
ground state and the excitation spectrum by developing a low-

energy effective theory. It shows that the JC model undergoes
a second order superradiant QPT in the η → ∞ limit. In the
broken-symmetry phase, we ﬁnd that the ground state forms
a photon condensate with a macroscopic photon occupation
number and that the excitation spectrum is gapless because
the Goldstone mode [20] emerges due to the broken continu-
ous symmetry.

We develop this further by showing that the JC lattice model
with only two lattice sites, the JC dimer, undergoes a Mott-
insulating-superﬂuid QPT in the same η → ∞ limit. While
the JC lattice model has been known to undergo a Mott-
insulating-superﬂuid QPT in the limit of inﬁnite lattice sites
[21–26], here, the QPT in the η → ∞ limit is supported by
the inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space associated with the har-
monic oscillator degree of freedom. Our exact analytical solu-
tion of the ground state and the excitation spectrum shows that
(i) the anti-symmetric normal mode of the coupled-cavities
undergoes a transition from a zero excitation insulating phase
to a superﬂuid phase with a broken global U (1) symmetry,
while the symmetric mode gets merely squeezed in the super-
ﬂuid phase and (ii) that the spectral gap of the anti-symmetric
mode closes at the critical point, beyond which the excita-
tion is gapless, while the symmetric mode remains gapped for
any coupling strength. We emphasize that our analysis is ana-
lytic and fully quantum mechanical, going beyond the mean-
ﬁeld approach that is often used in the studies of the JC lattice
model for the lack of the exact methods [22, 25].

Quantum phase transition in the JC model.— The Jaynes-

Cummings Hamiltonian reads

HJC = ω0a†a +

Ω
2

σz − λ(aσ+ + a†σ−).

(1)

Here, σ± = (σx ± iσy)/2 with σx,y,z being the Pauli matri-
ces, and a and a† are the lowering and raising operator of a
single mode cavity ﬁeld, respectively. The cavity frequency
is ω0, the transition frequency of the two-level atom Ω , and
the coupling strength λ. The conserved total number of ex-
citation, Ntot = a†a + σ+σ−, leads to a U (1)-continuous
symmetry, that is, the model is invariant under a gauge trans-
formation Uθ = eiθNtot. Let us denote |n(cid:105) as a n-photon
Fock state and |↑ (↓)(cid:105) as an eigenstate of σz with an eigen-

value 1(−1). We also introduce a dimensionless coupling
strength g = λ/√ω0Ω and a frequency ratio η = Ω/ω0.
Typically, the Jaynes-Cummings model is obtained as an ap-
proximation to the Rabi model by neglecting the so-called
counter rotating terms, −λ(aσ− + a†σ+) [7].
In systems
where the atom-ﬁeld interaction can be engineered, such as
in a circuit QED [27], trapped-ion systems [28] such counter-
rotating terms can be strongly suppressed and, remarkably, for
an atomic ∆m = ±1 transition in interaction with circularly
polarized light mode the rotating wave approximation is exact
such that Eq. (1) becomes a correct description for any g [29].
The vacuum state |0,↓(cid:105) is an energy eigenstate of the JC
model with an eigenvalue E0,↓ = −Ω/2. There are two basis
states with n total number of excitation, |n,↓(cid:105) and |n − 1,↑(cid:105),
which span the so-called JC-doublet, denoted as |n,±(cid:105), whose
energy eigenvalues in unit of Ω read

Regardless of η, for g < 1 the ground state of Eq.
(1) is
always |0,↓(cid:105), until at g = 1 there occurs a level crossing be-
tween |0,↓(cid:105) and |1,−(cid:105). This is followed by a series of level
crossings between the lower-energy states of adjacent JC dou-
blets, |n,−(cid:105) and |n + 1,−(cid:105) [Fig. 1 (a)]. Therefore, increas-
ing the atom-cavity coupling strength increases (cid:104)Ntot(cid:105) in the
ground state, nG, in discrete steps [Fig. 1 (c)]; in this sense,
the JC-type atom-cavity coupling itself assumes the role of a
chemical potential. Moreover, as η increases, the increase of
nG becomes progressively sharper near at g = 1 [Fig. 1 (c)].
In the η → ∞ limit, the nonlinearity in the spectrum of
the JC model disappears, leading to a harmonic spectrum in
the low energy sector, i.e., limη→∞(En,−(η, g) − E0,↓) =
ω0(1 − g2)n, which is a valid expression for any ﬁnite n.
The excitation energy for g < 1, a normal phase, is there-
fore np = ω0(1 − g2), which becomes zero at g = 1,
leading to a degeneracy between |n,−(cid:105) of any ﬁnite n and
|0,↓(cid:105). For g > 1, Eq. (2) shows a ground state instability
in a sense that the ground state energy can be indeﬁnitely
lowered by increasing n, until n becomes inﬁnite, where a
new energy minimum can be found. Regarding the Eq. (2)
as an effective potential for photon numbers, V η,g
eff (n), for
a ﬁxed value of η and g, we ﬁnd the potential minimum at
n = 0 for g < 1 and for n > 0 for g > 1 and any η
[Fig. 1 (b)]. For η (cid:29) 1, the potential minimum is located
at nsp(g) ≡ nG(g > 1) = η(g2 − g−2)/4 +O(η0), which ex-
plains very well the quadratic behavior of nG shown in Fig. 1
(c). Furthermore, in the η → ∞ limit and g > 1 it is imme-
diate that nG diverges; that is, a ground state superradiance
occurs.

The instability of the JC model for g > 1 in the η → ∞
limit predicted from Eq. (2) and the ﬁnite value of nsp sug-
gests the derivation of a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for
the superradiant phase g > 1 that is valid around the poten-
tial minimum. To this end, we displace the cavity ﬁeld a in
Eq. (1) by a complex number α = αgeiθ with αg = √nsp =

Interestingly, the effective Hamiltonian is quadratic only in
x quadrature of the cavity ﬁeld, while p quadrature does not
appear in the Hamiltonian in the η → ∞ limit [30]. The
ground state of ¯Hsp
JC is an eigenstate of x quadrature, which
is an inﬁnitely squeezed vacuum, whose major axis is the p
quadrature, i.e., |r → ∞(cid:105) = limr→∞ S[r]|0(cid:105) with S[r] =

Our analysis clearly demonstrates that the atom-cavity cou-
pling controls the number of photons in the ground state,
and that a large η leads to a divergence in the photon num-
ber of the ground state. We note that η plays precisely the
same role in the Jaynes-Cummings model as the number of
atoms in the Tavis-Cummings model [32], a N-atom gener-
alization of the JC model, which undergoes the same kind of
QPT [27]. Therefore, the fact that arbitrarily many photons
can be created through interaction with other quantum system,
regardless of its size, is the origin of the QPTs in a photonic
(phononic) system with ﬁnite components is possible, in con-
trast to systems with a hard-core bosons or spins which require
inﬁnitely many components to achieve a QPT.

Mott-insulator to Superﬂuid transition in a ﬁnite JC lattice
model.— We now consider a photonic lattice model with a
ﬁnite lattice size. We demonstrate that this model is capa-
ble of exhibiting Mott-superﬂuid type phase transitions away
from the conventional thermodynamic limit of inﬁnite lattice
sites. Speciﬁcally, we consider the JC lattice model [21–24]
which describes a one-dimensional lattice of coupled cavi-
ties each containing a two-level atom to realize the JC model,

eral not amenable to exact solutions, neither analytically nor
numerically; therefore its phase diagram, showing the Mott-
insulating-superﬂuid transition, is often studied based on the
mean-ﬁeld solution [22, 25]. For ﬁnite N, the numerially ex-
act calculation shows a crossover from a Mott insulating phase
to a superﬂuid-like phase, due to the ﬁnite-size effect which
generally prevents the system undergoing a true QPT [23].

We now choose N = 2, thus called as JC dimer, which
is the smallest possible number of sites for a lattice system,
and show that it undergoes a second-order Mott-insulating-
superﬂuid QPT, in the η → ∞ limit. Note that, unlike some
of the previous works [22, 25], we introduce neither a chemi-
cal potential term to ﬁx the number of polaritons nor counter-
rotating terms, which has been shown to stabilize the chemical
potential in Ref. [33]; rather, as witnessed in the previous sec-
tion, a strong JC-type interaction between the ﬁeld and the
atom itself modulates the number of polaritons of each cavity.
The JC dimer Hamiltonian can be written in in terms of two

normal modes, b1 = (a1 − a2)/√2 and b2 = (a1 + a2)/√2,

where we assume J/ω0 < 1. In the following we treat the two

rately. To treat the g < gc case, we ﬁrst apply a unitary trans-
formation to HJCD, which decouples the normal modes from

the displacement α lead to an identical spectrum, the ground
states are also inﬁnitely degenerate. The ground state of
the JC Hamiltonian for the superradiant phase is therefore
an inﬁnitely squeezed photon condensate, whose renormal-
ized photon occupation number is nG/η = (g2 − g−2)/4.

Moreover, the U (1) symmetry is spontaneously broken, as it
is evident from a non-zero spontaneous coherence (cid:104)a(cid:105) /η ≡
der parameter of the QPT in the JC model [Fig. 2].

G(θ)(cid:11) /η = eiθ(cid:112)(g2 − g−2)/4, which is an or-

We note that the critical behaviors described here, diverging
ground state energy, squeezing and spontaneous coherence,
arise only in the limit of η → ∞ as the QPT. For any ﬁnite
η, the ground state of the JC model has a ﬁnite energy with
a deﬁnite number of (cid:104)N(cid:105)tot for any value of g; moreover, by
the symmetry, the coherence of the ground state (cid:104)a(cid:105) and the
squeezing of the ground state is always zero. We remind that
this is exactly analogous with the fact that a model that under-
goes a QPT in the N → ∞ limit restores analytical behaviors
for any ﬁnite values of N [1, 5, 6].
Because the Eq. (4) is quadratic in only one quadrature
without the conjugate variable appearing in the Hamiltonian,
the excitation spectrum is gapless [Fig. 2]; that is, it takes
inﬁnitesimally small energy to excite the system from the
ground state. This gapless excitation is a well-known con-
sequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of continuous
U (1) symmetry and is often called as a Goldstone mode [20].
We note that the effective photon number potential shown in
Fig. 1 (b) or the mean-ﬁeld energy of the JC model [31] as-
sumes the form of the mexican-hat potential in a phase space
of the cavity ﬁeld a; therefore, the appearance of the Gold-
stone mode can be intuitively understood from the fact that
the excitation along the circle of the potential minima does not
cost any energy. Finally, the vanishing spectral gap near the
critical point gives rise to a critical exponent, (g) ∝ |g − 1|α
with α = 1, which differs from α = 1
2 of the Rabi model [7].
We have shown so far that the JC model, one of the most
fundamental in quantum optics, exhibits a second-order QPT.

the spectral gap of the b1 mode vanishes as  ∝ (g − gc(J))µ
with µ = 1 and beyond which the b1 mode becomes unsta-
ble. As a consequence, Eq. (6) is the valid effective Hamil-
tonian only for g < gc(J). In this phase, the ground state
is the simple vacuum |0,↓(cid:105) in the original cavity ﬁeld basis,
|0,↓(cid:105)1 |0,↓(cid:105)2. This corresponds to a n = 0 Mott-insulating
phase, where each cavity assumes a ﬁxed same number of ex-
citation. The b2 mode remains to be stable for g < gc(J).

As we have encountered already in the study of the JC
model, the fact that the b1-mode becomes unstable for g >
gc(J) suggests that it gets occupied by a macroscopic number
of photons. Therefore, it is insightful to look at the mean-ﬁeld
energy of HJCD, which we ﬁnd as EMF

For g > gc(J), we obtain a low-energy effective Hamil-
tonian of the JC dimer using a similar strategy successfully
used for the JC model in the ﬁrst part of this letter. That is,
we ﬁrst displace the b1 mode by its mean-ﬁeld amplitude β1,
which leads to a new quantization axis for two atoms and a

up to the constant ground state energy and gc here denotes
gc(J).

The two normal modes are decoupled from each other,
and the above Hamiltonian is exactly solvable. First, the
p1 quadrature of the b1 mode disappears from the effec-
tive Hamiltonian, as in the case of the JC model in the su-
perradiant phase shown in Eq. (4). Therefore, it immedi-
ately follows that the global U (1) symmetry of the JC lat-
tice model is broken for g > gc(J). The non-zero coher-
ence of each cavity ﬁeld (cid:104)ai(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0 marks the onset of the
superﬂuid phase and becomes an order parameter. The ex-
citation spectrum of the b1 mode is gapless, showing that the
Goldstone mode correctly emerges as the low-energy excita-
tion in the broken symmetry phase [Fig. 3 (b)]. The Hamil-
tonian for the b2 mode in Eq. (7) can be easily diagonalized
to give a harmonic spectrum with an excitation frequency of
c (J)/g4)). As shown in
SF
Fig. 3 (b), the b2 mode remains gapped for both phases. In-
terestingly, the ﬁrst derivative of SF
2 (g) is discontinuous at
g = gc(J). Such a slope discontinuity of the b2 mode can be
potentially used to detect the presence of the Goldstone mode
as suggested in Ref. [27]. The ground state of the b2 mode is
a squeezed vacuum, whose squeezing parameter is given by
ξ = −1/4 ln( 1
g = gc and gradually increases. The JC-dimer may also serve
as testing ground for the physics of phase interfaces in lattice
systems [35].

Conclusion– Unlike massive particles, photons can be cre-
ated by its interaction with an atom, as the chemical poten-
tial of the photon vanishes [36]. We have shown that for an
atom with a much larger characteristic frequency than the pho-
ton but strongly coupled to it, it is possible to have a macro-
scopic photon occupation in the ground state. This, as we have
demonstrated at the hand of the JC models, leads to the emer-
gence of a QPT in a system composed of ﬁnitely many compo-
nents, photonic modes and atoms. We expect that our ﬁnding
here, together with one presented in the Ref. [7], opens up an
important possibility to study critical phenomena of light and
sound, such as QPT, universality, and dynamics of the QPT, in
a fully controlled, small quantum systems including a super-
conducting circuits and trapped-ions.
