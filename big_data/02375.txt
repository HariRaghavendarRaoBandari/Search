We study the role of quantum entanglement (particle entanglement and mode entanglement) in
optical phase estimation by employing the ﬁrst and second quantization formalisms of quantum
mechanics. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) is expressed as a function of the ﬁrst and second
order optical coherence functions. The resulting form of the QFI elucidates the deriving metro-
logical resources for quantum phase estimation: ﬁeld intensity and photon detection correlations.
In addition, our analysis conﬁrms that mode entanglement is not required for quantum-enhanced
interferometry, whereas particle entanglement is a necessary requirement.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of quantum mechanics has paved the
way for an imminent technological revolution: Informa-
tion processing tasks (IPT) that successfully leverage
quintessential quantum mechanical resources (e.g. en-
tanglement) can substantially outperform their classical
counterparts. Notable examples include quantum com-
puting [1], quantum teleportation [2], quantum cryptog-
raphy [3], quantum-enhanced photodetector calibration
[4], quantum imaging [5], and quantum illumination [6].
The successful application of entanglement to achieve
these otherwise impossible IPTs has fostered the belief
that entanglement is an essential ingredient in attaining
a quantum advantage over classical IPTs.

In this paper, we study the physical resources respon-
sible for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation. For
this particular IPT, the goal is to estimate an unknown
parameter which is sampled by appropriately prepared
quantum probes. The performance of this task, typically
quantiﬁed by the variance in the estimated parameter,
can be immensely enhanced by employing non-classical
probes. For instance, if the quantum probe is a n qubit
state belonging to the Hilbert space H⊗n (where H is
a single qubit Hilbert space) then entanglement between
the n qubits is required to surpass the classical estimation
precision limit (i.e. the shot-noise-limit) [7]. In addition,
interferometric phase estimation below the shot-noise-
limit has been achieved using entangled states [8–11].
Such states typically contain both mode entanglement
and particle (i.e. photon) entanglement – prompting us
to ask: how does phase sensitivity depend on the diﬀerent
types of entanglements studied in quantum optics?

In the following, we elucidate the physical resources
that drive optical interferometric performance by ana-
lyzing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) from two
naturally arising and distinct perspectives, resulting from
the ﬁrst and the second quantization formalisms of quan-
tum mechanics. We deduce the following properties of

∗ jsahota@physics.utoronto.ca

the probe state to be conducive to quantum-enhanced
phase estimation: (i) the mean photon number of the
probe state, which is proportional to the energy of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld corresponding to the probe, and (ii)
the detection correlations exhibited by the photons, as
qualiﬁed by the Glauber coherence functions. Finally,
we illustrate the dependence of these photon correlations
on mode entanglement and particle entanglement in or-
der to determine the role of each type of entanglement in
quantum-enhanced phase estimation.

II. BACKGROUND

The role of mode entanglement has been studied for
speciﬁc nonlinear quantum metrology systems by Tilma,
et al.
[12], and independently by Datta and Shaji [13].
Their work suggests that mode entanglement is not a vi-
tal resource for obtaining a quantum-advantage in non-
linear metrology. In the following we focus our discussion
on the experimentally pertinent and readily accessible
scenario of linear quantum metrology.
In addition, in-
stead of examining speciﬁc systems, as done in previous
approaches, we provide a general argument about metro-
logical resources using the QFI.

FIG. 1. (Color online) Schematic diagram of the MZI. The
arms inside the interferometer are represented by modes ˆa
and ˆb. The dotted red line indicated that the probe state,
inside the interferometer, can potentially be mode entangled.

In linear quantum metrology, we are interested in
measuring an unknown parameter ϕ that has been en-
coded in a probe state |Ψ(cid:105) via the unitary transformation
U = exp (iϕ ˆH), generated by a linear Hamiltonian ˆH. If
|Ψ(cid:105) ∈ H⊗n, then entanglement between the n qubits is
required to overcome the shot-noise-limit [7]. Whereas, if
|Ψ(cid:105) does not describe a n qubit probe, but instead a probe
containing n indistinguishable particles (e.g. n photons),
then the utility of entanglement for enhanced metrology
is rather unclear. In the following, we study the role of
quantum entanglement for this speciﬁc scenario.

paradigm for studying linear quantum parameter esti-
mation with optical systems. As illustrated in Fig. 1,
light is injected into a 50:50 beam-splitter (BS), result-
ing in a potentially mode entangled probe state inside
the MZI. The bosonic creation and annihilation opera-
tors, ˆa, ˆa† and ˆb, ˆb†, correspond to the two arms inside
the MZI and thus describe diﬀerent spatial modes of the
probe state. The unknown parameter ϕ is encoded into
the probe state as a relative phase-shift between modes
ˆa and ˆb. After the phase-shift, the operation of the ini-
tial BS is reversed by using a second 50:50 BS. The light
coming out of the ﬁnal BS is measured [14], and the re-
sulting signal in processed in order to estimate ϕ. The
operation of the MZI can be concisely described using
the Schwinger representation of the angular momentum
operators[15]:

That is, the ﬁrst and second BSs are described by
exp (−i π
ˆJx) respectively. The phase-
shift is given by exp (iϕ ˆJz). If we denote the state in-
jected into the ﬁrst BS as |Ψo(cid:105), then the probe state (the
state immediately preceding the phase-shift operation)
can be expressed as

|Ψ(cid:105) = e−i π

2

ˆJx|Ψo(cid:105).

(2)

The operators in Eq.(1a) to Eq.(1c) satisfy the SU(2) Lie
algebra commutation relations

[ ˆJk, ˆJl] = iklm ˆJm,

(3)

where klm is the Levi-Civita symbol, and commute with
the operator representing the total number of particles

ˆna + ˆnb = 2 ˆJ0.

(4)

2. The Quantum Fisher Information

2

Given expression (2) for the MZI probe state, we can
write the modiﬁed probe state (the state after the phase-
shift has occurred) as |Ψϕ(cid:105) = exp (−iϕ ˆJz)|Ψ(cid:105). Now we
can quantify the phase-shift sensitivity of this particular
probe by using the QFI, which for pure states is deﬁned
as

F = 4(cid:0)(cid:104)Ψ(cid:48)

ϕ|Ψϕ(cid:105)|2(cid:1) ,

ϕ|Ψ(cid:48)

ϕ(cid:105) − |(cid:104)Ψ(cid:48)

(5)

where the primes denote derivatives with respect to ϕ
[16]. The QFI is an indispensable tool
in quantum
metrology as it determines the ultimate lower-bound on
the variance ∆ϕ of the estimated parameter attainable
by using any locally unbiased estimator and by perform-
ing any quantum measurements on |Ψϕ(cid:105) [16–18]. This is
expressed mathematically as the quantum Cram´er-Rao
bound:

∆ϕ ≥ 1√
F

.

(6)

Therefore, we will quantify the performance of a MZI
phase estimation protocol using F [19]. In addition, we
will discuss the physical properties of the probe state
that can be manipulated in order to increase F.
In
the case of the MZI, F = 4Var[ ˆJz], where Var[ ˆJz] =
(cid:104)Ψ| ˆJ 2
z|Ψ(cid:105) − (cid:104)Ψ| ˆJz|Ψ(cid:105)2 is the variance in the phase-shift
Hamiltonian. This follows directly from Eq.(5) and the
expression |Ψϕ(cid:105) = exp (−iϕ ˆJz)|Ψ(cid:105) of the modiﬁed probe.

B. Quantum Entanglement

In order to facilitate the later discussion on the role of
entanglement in phase estimation protocols, we review
the deﬁnition of entanglement and how it manifests itself
in diﬀerent domains (i.e. mode vs. particle entangle-
ments).
Suppose the n-partite pure state |Ψn(cid:105) belongs to the

Hilbert space

H = H1 ⊗ H2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ Hn =

The state |Ψn(cid:105) is separable if and only if

N(cid:79)

|Ψn(cid:105) =

|ψ(i)(cid:105),

n(cid:79)

i=1

Hi.

(7)

(8)

i=1

where |ψ(i)(cid:105) can be any state in Hi. We deﬁne |Ψn(cid:105) to
be entangled if and only if it is not separable. Therefore,
it is evident that the entanglement of a quantum state
depends on how we chose to partition its ambient Hilbert
space. In quantum optics, there are two distinct and nat-
urally arising ways of partitioning the Hilbert space: (i)
we can partition with respect to the spatial modes of the

electromagnetic ﬁeld corresponding to the quantum state
and (ii) we can partition with respect to the individual
photons in the quantum state. In the following, we refer
to approach (i) and approach (ii) as the mode picture
and the particle picture respectively.

1. Mode Entanglement

In the mode picture, the Hilbert space of the MZI
probe state (2) is partitioned with respect to the spatial
modes corresponding to the two arms of the interferome-
ter (Fig. 1): H = Ha⊗Hb. Let |ψ(a)(cid:105) be any state in Ha.
Likewise, let |ψ(b)(cid:105) be any state in Hb. Then, by the deﬁ-
nition given above, the probe state (2) is mode entangled
if and only if |Ψ(cid:105) (cid:54)= |ψ(a)(cid:105) ⊗ |ψ(b)(cid:105). In the mode picture,
this system has a bipartite structure for which the notion
of entanglement is succinctly quantiﬁed in terms of the
Schmidt decomposition [1].

2. Particle Entanglement

In the particle picture, we can deﬁne photon entangle-
ment provided that the probe state contains precisely n
photons (i.e. there are no particle number ﬂuctuations).
We introduce pseudo-labels for these photons: 1, 2, . . . , n,
which can be used to partition the Hilbert space as in Eq.
(7). Hence, we can deﬁne particle entanglement using the
criterion of separability outlined above. Note that since
the photons in the probe state are indistinguishable, the
labels we have introduced are ﬁctitious and serve merely
as a book-keeping tool.
In other words, we are deﬁn-
ing entanglement between operationally inaccessible sub-
systems, which has provoked considerable debate in the
past concerning the utility of such entanglement [20–24].
This issue was recently settled by Killoran, et al. by
constructing a protocol for converting identical-particle
entanglement into entanglement between distinguishable
spatial modes, which can be used to execute the various
IPTs discussed above [25]. In section IV, we will outline
the type of photon entanglement required for quantum-
enhanced MZI phase estimation.

C. Optical Coherence of a MZI Probe

The quantum resources for optical phase estimation
can be quantiﬁed using the concept of optical coherence.
Therefore, we will review some relevant topics form op-
tical conference theory in this section [26, 27].

An electric ﬁeld

ˆE (r, t) = ˆE(+) (r, t) + ˆE(−) (r, t)

(9)

can be expanded, in a volume V , in terms of orthonormal

spatial-temporal modes, such that

(10)

and ˆE(−) = ˆE(+)† [28] [29]. The frequency and spatial
proﬁle of the kth mode are denoted as Ωk and uk (r),
receptively. The bosonic creation and annihilation oper-
†

ators satisfy the commutation relations [ˆak, ˆa
The electric ﬁeld for the MZI probe (2) has support on
only two spatial modes, a and b (Fig. 2), deﬁned as

ˆa (t) ua (r) ≡(cid:88)
ˆb (t) ub (r) ≡(cid:88)

1. Field Intensity and Photon Detection

Figure 2 depicts two detectors, A and B, which inter-
cept the ﬁelds in mode a and b, respectively. What is
the probability that one of the detectors will register a

FIG. 2. (Color online) A state |Ψo(cid:105), with mean photon num-
ber ¯n, is injected to a 50:50 BS to create the probe state (2).
Photon detectors A and B intercept modes a and b of the
probe |Ψ(cid:105), respectively. The photon detection correlations,
as quantiﬁed by the coherence functions: g(2)
a,b, and
the mean energy of the probe (which is proportional to ¯n) de-
termine metrological performance and thus these parameters
can be thought of as quantiﬁable resources for optical phase
estimation.

detection event? As outlined below, this probability is
directly proportional to the intensity of the ﬁeld incident
on the detector in question – which is also a resource for
phase estimation (as discussed later in section III).

A detection event is registered at detector A when a
photon from mode a (11) is annihilated and absorbed by
the detector, resulting in the production of a photoelec-
tron, which is ampliﬁed to a macroscopically observable
photocurrent. Therefore, the probe state |Ψ(cid:105) is mapped
to |f(cid:105) ∼ ˆa (t)|Ψ(cid:105). The transition probability for this
process can be obtained using Fermi’s golden rule [28]:

P|Ψ(cid:105)→|f(cid:105) ∼ |(cid:104)f|ˆa (t)|Ψ(cid:105)|2.

(14)
Summing over the set of all possible ﬁnal states {|f(cid:105)} to
which the probe can transition gives the probability of
observing a detection at A.

= (cid:104)Ψ|ˆna|Ψ(cid:105) = ¯na,

(15)
where ˆna = ˆa† (t) ˆa (t). Likewise, we obtain that the
probability of observing a detection at detector B is di-
rectly proportional to the intensity of the incident ﬁeld,
¯nb, on detector B. The total intensity ¯n = ¯na + ¯nb
is conserved by the MZI operations (i.e. beamsplitters
and phase-shifters). Hence, ¯n is typically regarded as a
metrology resource and important phase sensitivity lim-
its are deﬁned in terms of how the QFI scales with respect
to ¯n. For example, F ∼ ¯n means shot-noise scaling and
F ∼ ¯n2 means Heisenberg scaling. In section III, we will
express the QFI in terms of the ﬁled intensities, ¯na and
¯nb, and the second order coherence functions for the MZI
probe.

2. Photon Detection Correlations

The probability of detecting two photons simultane-
ously is proportional to the second order coherence func-
tion. Two photons are detected simultaneously at detec-
tor A provided that two photons are annihilated simul-
taneously in mode a, such that |Ψ(cid:105) → |f(cid:105) ∼ ˆa2 (t)|Ψ(cid:105).
The probability for such a transition occurring is propor-
tional to |(cid:104)f|ˆa2 (t)|Ψ(cid:105)|2 [28]. Again, we sum over the set
of all possible ﬁnal states {|f(cid:105)} to obtain the probability
of observing a two photon simultaneous detection events
at A. This gives

P (2)
detection ∼ (cid:104)Ψ|ˆa†2ˆa2|Ψ(cid:105),

(16)

where we have dropped the time dependence to simplify
notation. Rescaling (16), by dividing the right-hand-
side by ¯n2
a, gives the second order coherence function for

4

mode a. We can deﬁne an analogous coherence functions
for mode b and simultaneously for both modes a and b.
Therefore, the second order MZI coherence functions are

Whereas, g(2)

III. THE MODE PICTURE: THE QFI AS A

FUNCTION OF OPTICAL COHERENCE

As described in section II A 2, the performance of a
MZI phase estimation protocol can be quantiﬁed by the
QFI F = 4Var[ ˆJz]. Now we will analyze this expression
in the mode picture, where ˆJz is deﬁned in Eq.
(1c).
Expanding Var[ ˆJz] gives

F = Var[ˆna] + Var[ˆnb] − 2 Cov[ˆna, ˆnb],

(20)
where ˆna = ˆa†ˆa, ˆnb = ˆb†ˆb, and Cov[ˆna, ˆnb] = (cid:104)ˆna ⊗ ˆnb(cid:105) −
(cid:104)ˆna(cid:105)(cid:104)ˆnb(cid:105) is the covariance of ˆna and ˆnb. We infer from
(20) that the phase sensitivity depends on intra-mode
and inter-mode properties of the probe state, which are
quantiﬁed by the variance of the photon number oper-
ator of each interferometric mode and the Cov[ˆna, ˆnb],
respectively. This inter-mode and intra-mode correlation
dependence was highlighted in Ref.[30] by expressing (20)
in terms of the Mandel-Q parameter and the Pearson cor-
relation parameters for the two MZI modes.

Here we will express (20) as a function of ﬁrst order
coherence, namely ¯na and ¯nb, and the second order MZI
coherence functions (17) – (19) in order to highlight ex-
plicitly the dependence of the QFI on intra-mode and
inter-mode correlations. We start by noting that, the
commutation relation [ˆa, ˆa†] = 1 can be used to rewrite
(17) as g(2)

a = 1 + Var[ˆna]/¯n2

Var[ˆna] = ¯na + ¯n2
a

Likewise, for mode b we obtain

Var[ˆnb] = ¯nb + ¯n2
b

Now using Eq.(21), Eq.(22),
Cov[ˆna, ˆnb] = ¯na ¯nb(g(2)

This equation expresses the optimal MZI phase sensitiv-
ity as a function of physically accessible properties of the
probe (cf. Fig. 2), namely the ﬁrst and second order op-
tical coherences: the ﬁeld intensities and the second or-
der Glauber coherences functions, respectively. Eq. (23)
takes a particularly concise form when the probe |Ψ(cid:105) is
taken to be a path-symmetric state: i.e. |Ψ(cid:105) is invariant
with respect to an exchange (nonphysical) of modes a and
b. For such states ¯na = ¯nb = ¯n/2 and g(2) ≡ g(2)
a = g(2)

Therefore, (23) becomes

(24)

As discussed in Ref.

[37], path-symmetric states are
ubiquitous in metrology, hence equation Eq. (24) holds
for most probe states of interest (for example, see table
I). Note that the ﬁrst term in (23) and (24) is the classi-
cal (i.e. shot-noise) scaling term: it deﬁnes the optimal
phase sensitivity attainable by a classical probe. In or-
der to surpass the shot-noise limit, quantum correlations
must be leveraged as described the remaining terms in
(23) and (24) – these Heisenberg limited terms add up
to zero in the classical case of laser interferometry. We
deduce that phase sensitivity is positively correlated with
g(2) (intra-mode photon detection correlations) and neg-
atively correlated with g(2)
a,b (inter-mode photon detection
correlations). In addition, it is evident that mode entan-
glement is not vital for quantum metrology as Heisen-
berg scaling can be attained solely manipulating g(2) (e.g.
consider the mode separable twin squeezed state probe,
|Ψ(cid:105) = |Sa(cid:105) ⊗ |Sb(cid:105) [30]).

IV. THE PARTICLE PICTURE

Now we will partition the Hilbert space of the probe
state with respect to individual photons, which have two
orthogonal internal state |µ(i)(cid:105) and |ν(i)(cid:105), where i is a
pseudo-label for the photons as discussed in section II B 2.
Note that this is only possible in the case where the state
in question has a well deﬁned number of photons (i.e. is
an Eigenstate of the operator ˆJ0). When the state has
particle ﬂuctuations one can still talk about the particle
entanglement contained in its n particle sectors. In Ta-
ble (I) we list several states previously used in Metrology
with particle ﬂuctuations and provide their decomposi-
tion in terms of states containing exactly n particles.
in the {|µ(i)(cid:105),|ν(i)(cid:105)} basis:

We can deﬁne the Pauli operators for the ith photon

x = |µ(i)(cid:105)(cid:104)ν(i)| + |ν(i)(cid:105)(cid:104)µ(i)|,
ˆσ(i)
y = −i|µ(i)(cid:105)(cid:104)ν(i)| + i|ν(i)(cid:105)(cid:104)µ(i)|,
ˆσ(i)
z = |µ(i)(cid:105)(cid:104)µ(i)| − |ν(i)(cid:105)(cid:104)ν(i)|.
ˆσ(i)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(cid:80)

Let us denote ˆσ(i) = (ˆσ(i)
i ˆσ(i),
where the sum is over all the particles in the state. Now

z ) and ˆJ = 1

x , ˆσ(i)

y , ˆσ(i)

we can deﬁne the collective spin operators

ˆJv = v · ˆJ,

(28)
where the unit vector v ∈ R3 speciﬁes the spin direction.
For directions x = (1, 0, 0), y = (0, 1, 0), and z = (0, 0, 1),
we obtain the collective spin operators

ˆJx = x · ˆJ, ,
ˆJy = y · ˆJ, ,
ˆJz = z · ˆJ, ,

(29a)

(29b)

(29c)

which satisfy the SU(2) Lie algebra commutation rela-
tions 3. Note that the Jordan-Schwinger isomorphism
dictates the equivalence of (1a), (1b), (1c) with (29a),
(29b), (29c) .

Now we can succinctly express the various MZI
ﬁrst
exp (−iϕ ˆJz), ﬁnal BS:

operations in terms of these operators;
BS: exp (−i π
exp (i π

ˆJx), and the complete MZI unitary:

ˆJx), phase-shift:

i.e.

2

ˆUMZI = e−i π

2

ˆJx e−iϕ ˆJz ei π

2

ˆJx

= e−iϕ ˆJy .

(30)
All unitary transformations of the form exp (−iγ v · ˆJ)
can be factorized for each particle as

eiγv· ˆσ(1) ⊗ e−iγv· ˆσ(2) ⊗ ··· ⊗ e−iγv· ˆσ(n)

,

(31)

where γ is some arbitrary interaction constant. As noted
in Ref.[38], this means that all MZI unitaries are local
in the particle picture (this is not true in the mode pic-
ture). Since particle entanglement is preserved by MZI
operations, we are enticed to investigate its role as a po-
tential resources for phase estimation. Hyllus et al. have
illustrated a positive correlation between a speciﬁc form
of particle entanglement and phase sensitivity [38, 39].

Now we are ready to analyze the QFI in the particle
picture. Using expression (29c) for ˆJz, we can write the
QFI as follows.

see that when there is no entanglement between particles,
i.e. when Cov[ˆσ(i)
z ] = 0, the maximum phase sensi-
tivity is shot-noise limited, as evident from the remaining
nVar[ˆσ(i)
z ] term in (34). In order to surpass the SNL, the
probe state must contain particle entanglement. The par-
z , ˆσ(j)
ticle entanglement must be such that Cov[ˆσ(i)
z ] > 0.
This result supports the ﬁndings of Ref.
[7] and Ref.
[40]: if the SNL is surpassed, then the probe state must
be particle entangled.

V. CONCLUSION

The QFI for the MZI can be expressed in terms of
ﬁrst and second order Glauber coherence functions, as in
Eq.(23) and Eq.(24). It is evident from these equations
that the ﬁeld intensity of the probe state (i.e. mean

photon number) and its detection correlations (both
inter-mode and intra-mode) are a resource of quantum-
enhanced phase estimation. More speciﬁcally, the QFI is
positively correlated with ﬁeld intensity and the intra-
mode coherence functions (17) and (18). Whereas, a
negative correlation is exhibited with respect to the inter-
mode coherence function (19). These resource parame-
ters may be controlled experimentally in order to maxi-
mize phase sensitivity.

Using the ﬁrst quantization formalism, the QFI can
also be expressed in terms of Pauli operators of the in-
dividual photons in the probe state (34). It follows from
this form of the QFI that photon correlations, resulting
from particle entanglement, are required to surpass the
SNL. We note that for states with a ﬁxed photon num-
ber, Eq.(23) and Eq.(34) are equivalent; this can be con-
ﬁrmed mathematically using the Jordan-Schwinger iso-
morphism.

In studying quantum entanglement using the sec-
ond quantization formalism of quantum mechanics, we
conclude that mode entanglement is not required for
quantum-enhanced phase estimation. On the other hand,
we used the ﬁrst quantization formalism to deduce the

necessity of particle entanglement in order to obtain an

advantage over classical phase estimation.
