(Dated: March 7, 2016)

The electromagnetic structure of 140Sm was studied in a low-energy Coulomb excitation experi-
ment with a radioactive ion beam from the REX-ISOLDE facility at CERN. The 2+ and 4+ states of
the ground-state band and a second 2+ state were populated by multi-step excitation. The analysis
of the diﬀerential Coulomb excitation cross sections yielded reduced transition probabilities between
all observed states and the spectroscopic quadrupole moment for the 2+
1 state. The experimental re-
sults are compared to large-scale shell model calculations and beyond-mean-ﬁeld calculations based
on the Gogny D1S interaction with a ﬁve-dimensional collective Hamiltonian formalism. Simpler
geometric and algebraic models are also employed to interpret the experimental data. The results
indicate that 140Sm shows considerable γ softness, but in contrast to earlier speculation no signs of
shape coexistence at low excitation energy. This work sheds more light on the onset of deformation
and collectivity in this mass region.

INTRODUCTION

The shape of atomic nuclei is a fundamental property
which is governed by the interplay between single-particle
and collective degrees of freedom. Nuclei with closed pro-
ton and neutron shells are spherical in their ground state,
whereas the occupation of shape-driving orbitals causes
nuclei with open shells to be deformed. The majority
of deformed nuclei is found to have prolate (elongated)
quadrupole shapes. For heavy nuclei with Z, N > 50,

oblate ground-state shapes are rare and mostly found in
regions with holes in high-spin, low-Ω orbitals near the
top of the proton and neutron shells [1]. Mean-ﬁeld cal-
culations based on Gogny [2] or Skyrme [3] interactions
predict oblate ground states, e.g. for platinum and mer-
cury isotopes with N > 106 and for N ≈ 78 and N ≈ 120
isotones with Z > 60.

In certain regions of the nuclear chart, prolate and
oblate shapes are found to coexist at low excitation en-
ergy. Shape coexistence at low energy can generally be
expected when there is a competition between an en-
ergy gap and a residual interaction that favors excitations
across the gap [4, 5]. Prominent examples for shape coex-
istence based on this mechanism are found in the Z = 82
region near neutron mid-shell, e.g. in 186Pb [6] and the
neighboring mercury isotopes [7]. Not surprisingly these

nuclei lie in the region where mean-ﬁeld calculations pre-
dict the transition from prolate to oblate ground-state
shapes. From these observations one may expect to ﬁnd
shape coexistence also in the N ≈ 78 region near pro-
ton mid-shell, where the role of protons and neutrons
is interchanged. However, clear experimental indication
for shape coexistence near the ground state is lacking in
this region, and it was argued that the Z = 64 sub-shell
closure could explain the absence of shape coexistence
in this region [4]. There is, however, evidence for shape
coexistence at higher excitation energy in the N = 78 iso-
tones 140Sm and 142Gd. Two isomeric 10+ states based
on the conﬁguration (πh11/2)2 and (νh11/2)−2 are found
in both nuclei [8]. Lifetime measurements found the ro-
tational bands built on top of the 10+ states with proton-
particle and neutron-hole character in 140Sm to be con-
sistent with prolate and oblate shape, respectively [9].
The shape associated with the states in the ground-state
band of 140Sm below the 10+ isomers is not clear and is
the subject of the present investigation.

2 ) state at 990 keV and a (3+

Relativistic mean-ﬁeld calculations restricted to axial
deformations predicted the ground state of 140Sm to have
oblate shape, whereas prolate deformation was found to
develop rapidly in the lighter samarium isotopes with
N ≤ 76 [10]. More recent relativistic Hartree Fock Bo-
goliubov (HFB) calculations ﬁnd a smooth transition
from spherical 144Sm to well-deformed prolate 134Sm
with a γ-soft potential energy surface for the transitional
nucleus 140Sm [11]. The observation and tentative as-
signment of a (2+
1 ) state
at 1599 keV in 140Sm following the β decay of 140Eu
was interpreted as evidence for a low-lying γ band [12].
The observation was supported by triaxial-rotor calcu-
lations based on a Woods-Saxon potential, which repro-
duced the excitation energies of the presumed γ band and
also found the potential energy surface for 140Sm to be
soft in the triaxial degree of deformation [12]. However,
a subsequent β-decay experiment revised the earlier spin
values and tentatively assigned spin-parity (0+) and (2+)
to the states at 990 keV and 1599 keV, respectively [13].
The presence of a second 0+ state at such low excitation
energy is somewhat surprising when comparing with the
systematics of excited states in neighboring nuclei. On
the other hand, such a low-lying 0+
2 state could indicate
the presence of shape coexistence near the ground state of
140Sm. The spin assignments for the two states in ques-
tion were clariﬁed in a recent measurement of γ-γ angular
correlations following the β decay of 140Eu, which ﬁrmly
showed that the state at 990 keV in 140Sm has spin-parity
2+ and the state at 1599 keV 0(+) [14]. The level scheme
for the states of the ground-state band and the lowest
non-yrast states is shown in Fig. 1.

The collectivity of the 2+

1 state in 140Sm was stud-
ied in a recent recoil distance lifetime measurement [15].
The resulting B(E2; 2+
1 ) value and its com-
parison to the neigboring samarium isotopes indicates
a gradual onset of deformation when removing neu-
trons from the closed-shell nucleus 144Sm82. The ex-

perimental B(E2; 2+
1 ) values for the entire chain
of neutron-deﬁcient samarium isotopes are well repro-
duced by microscopic HFB calculations with the Gogny
D1S interaction with mapping to the ﬁve-dimensional
collective Hamiltonian (5DCH) for quadrupole excita-
tions [15]. The theoretical calculations explain the on-
set of quadrupole collectivity in the samarium isotopes
below N = 82 by a gradual shape transition from large
prolate deformation with axial symmetry for the lightest
isotopes to spherical shape in 144Sm, with the triaxial de-
gree of freedom becoming more important as N = 82 is
approached. The Gogny 5DCH calculations ﬁnd average
quadrupole parameters of hβi = 0.17 and hγi = 29◦ for
the ground state of 140Sm [15].
It appears that the onset of deformation in the samar-
ium isotopes is diﬀerent above and below the neutron
shell closure. For N > 82 the samarium nuclei show an
abrupt increase in deformation at N = 90, whereas the
onset of deformation is more gradual for N < 82 with
apparent triaxiality in the transitional region around
140Sm. The rapid increase in deformation from N = 88
to N = 90 in the samarium and gadolinium isotopes can
be explained by the occupation of proton and neutron
spin-orbit partner orbitals which causes the disappear-
ance of the Z = 64 sub-shell closure for N ≥ 90 [16].
The transitional nucleus 152Sm was identiﬁed as one of
the best realizations of the so-called X(5) critical point
symmetry [17, 18], which represents a ﬁrst-order phase
transition from a spherical vibrational to a deformed ro-
tational nucleus. The analysis of excitation spectra for
the samarium isotopes with N < 82 using the interact-
ing boson approximation (IBA) found model parameters
for 138Sm and 140Sm that place these nuclei between the
U(5) and the SO(6) limits of the IBA [19], i.e. at the tran-
sition between a spherical vibrator and a γ-soft vibrator
characterized by the so-called E(5) critical point sym-
metry [20]. However, without any experimental B(E2)
values beyond the 2+
1 state and uncertain spin assign-

ments for the lowest non-yrast states it was not possible
to evaluate a possible E(5) character for 140Sm.

and assume that the excitation process can be described
by a pure electromagnetic interaction.

In this article we present the results of a Coulomb
excitation experiment using a radioactive 140Sm beam,
which provides several B(E2) values and also the spectro-
scopic quadrupole moment for the 2+
1 state. Low-energy
Coulomb excitation is an ideal method to study the col-
lectivity and deformation in this nucleus, since both yrast
and non-yrast states can be populated and transition
probabilities extracted without interference from the iso-
meric 10+ states. The comparison of the experimental
results with theoretical calculations sheds more light on
the onset of deformation and collectivity in this mass re-
gion. The article is organized as follows: The experimen-
tal details and data analysis are described in Sec. II. The
extraction of electromagnetic matrix elements from the
Coulomb excitation yields is described in Sec. III. The
results are discussed and compared to theoretical calcu-
lations in Sec. IV, followed by a summary and conclusions
in Sec. V.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The application of the isotope separation on-line
(ISOL) technique in combination with selective laser ion-
ization and post-acceleration made it possible to study
the electromagnetic properties of 140Sm by Coulomb ex-
citation. Radioactive 140Sm atoms with a half-life of
14.8 min were produced at the CERN-ISOLDE facility
by spallation of a primary tantalum target with 1.4 GeV
protons from the PS Booster. Samarium atoms were se-
lectively ionized using the Resonance Ionization Laser Ion
Source (RILIS) [21], which was equipped with a GdB6
low-work function cavity [22] to reduce the surface ion-
ization of isobaric impurities. After selection of mass
A = 140 using the general purpose separator GPS, the
ions were bunched, cooled, and trapped in the REX-
TRAP [23], and then further ionized to charge state
34+ using the EBIS charge breeder [24]. Finally the
highly charged 140Sm ions were accelerated to an en-
ergy of 2.85A MeV in the REX linear accelerator [25].
An average intensity of 2 × 105 particles per second was
achieved over a beam time of approximately 100 hours.
The 140Sm projectiles were scattered on a secondary
94Mo target of 2 mg/cm2 thickness. Both 140Sm pro-
jectiles and 94Mo target nuclei were excited in the low-
energy Coulomb excitation reaction. The distance of
closest approach of 19.2 fm between the projectiles and
target nuclei for the given reaction parameters is larger
than the distance of 17.2 fm, which is obtained by apply-
ing the safe distance separation criterion [26]

) + 5 fm,

where Ap and At are the mass numbers of the projectile
and target, respectively. Under these conditions, it is
safe to neglect all inﬂuence of the strong nuclear force

Gamma rays from excited states in the 140Sm projec-
tiles and 94Mo target nuclei were detected in the MINI-
BALL HPGe detector array [27], which at the time of
the experiment consisted of seven triple-cluster modules,
each of which comprised three six-fold segmented germa-
nium crystals. An energy and eﬃciency calibration for
the germanium detectors was performed using standard
152Eu and 133Ba sources. An annular double-sided sil-
icon strip detector (DSSSD) of 1000 µm thickness was
mounted in the MINIBALL target chamber and used to
detect both scattered projectiles and recoiling target nu-
clei. The DSSSD consisted of four individual quadrants
with each 16 concentric annular strips on the front side
and 12 azimuthal sector strips on the back side. The
annular strips had a strip pitch of 2 mm and the az-
imuthal strips covered 3.5◦ each.
In total, the DSSSD
covered 5000 mm2 with an active area of 93% [28]. The
detector was mounted in forward direction at a distance
of 25.2 mm from the target, covering the angular range
from 19.7◦ to 58.4◦ in the laboratory frame.
In the
center-of-mass frame, the angular coverage corresponded
to 49.7◦ < θCM < 146◦ for the detection of 140Sm pro-
jectiles and 63.1◦ < θCM < 140.7◦ for the detection of
recoiling target nuclei.

The data acquisition was triggered and events were
built when the MINIBALL and DSSSD detectors gave
coincident signals. Prompt particle-γ coincidences were
selected by applying a prompt gate in the time spec-
trum, and background from random coincidences was
subtracted as shown in Fig. 2. The energy spectrum for
particles as a function of scattering angle measured with
one DSSSD quadrant in coincidence with γ-rays detected
in MINIBALL is shown in Fig. 3. The contours illustrate
the separation and selection for scattered projectiles and
recoiling target nuclei. The innermost annular strips of
the DSSSD could not be used in the further analysis be-
cause of insuﬃcient separation between the projectiles
and target nuclei. The inverse kinematics with heavier
projectiles and lighter target nuclei leads to an ambiguity
where diﬀerent center-of-mass scattering angles result in
the same laboratory detection angle for the 140Sm pro-
jectiles, which is further complicated by the low-energy
cut-oﬀ for projectiles with the largest center-of-mass scat-
tering angles. For this reason, the detection angle of the
recoiling target nuclei was used to determine the center-
of-mass scattering angle. For those center-of-mass scat-
tering angles where both projectiles and recoiling tar-
get nuclei are expected to hit the sensitive region of the
DSSSD, it was required that both particles were detected
in opposite quadrants of the detector. The reaction kine-
matics and the hit pattern in the DSSSD were further-
more used to verify that the beam was well centered.

The γ rays detected in MINIBALL are Doppler shifted
depending on the velocity and angle with respect to the
emitting particle. Since it is not possible to determine
if a given γ ray is emitted from a 140Sm or 94Mo nu-

cleus, two spectra are produced with the assumption that
all γ rays are emitted by either the projectiles or target
nuclei and by applying the appropriate Doppler correc-
tion using the information from the DSSSD. This proce-
dure results in two spectra where some transitions were
properly Doppler corrected and appear as sharp peaks,
whereas others are very broad due to a wrong Doppler
correction. As long as the sharp and broad peaks are not
overlapping it is possible to determine the intensities of
the transitions from the respective spectra.

Background subtracted spectra with Doppler correc-

respectively. The 2+

1 transi-
tion at 460 keV are visible in the spectrum that is Doppler
corrected for the 140Sm velocity. A hint of a transition is
visible at 774 keV, marked by a purple arrow in Fig. 4.
The energy corresponds to the 2+
1 transition in
140Nd, which could be present as a contaminant in the
beam. From the intensity of the transition this contami-
nation is estimated to have an upper limit of 0.8% of the
total beam intensity. The γ-ray energy spectrum with
Doppler correction for the projectiles contains no indica-
tion of other beam contaminants.

The beam composition was monitored by performing
regular measurements during which the RILIS lasers were
periodically switched on and oﬀ. Fig. 6 shows the spectra
acquired during periods in which the lasers were turned
on and oﬀ, respectively. Even in the spectrum with the
lasers turned oﬀ only the 2+
1 transition in 140Sm
is visible, although with much lower intensity compared
to the spectrum taken with laser ionization. The accel-
eration of 140Sm without laser is due to surface ioniza-
tion. The presence of any beam contaminants should be
enhanced in the spectrum taken without lasers. The ab-
sence of any other transitions further supports the con-
clusion that the beam was composed of at least 99.2%
140Sm during the measurements with the lasers switched
on.

An additional germanium detector was placed behind
the beam dump downstream from MINIBALL to moni-

evidence for any radioactive beam contaminants. The
small possible 140Nd contaminant was considered negli-
gible, and all further analysis was performed under the
assumption that the 140Sm beam was pure.

topic contamination in the target. This interpretation is
supported by the fact that the same weak transition was
also observed in previous experiments using the same tar-
get foil [29]. Since the electromagnetic matrix elements
are well known for both 94Mo [30] and 95Mo [31], the
amount of 95Mo in the target can be determined from
the Coulomb excitation analysis, as will be discussed be-
low.

III. COULOMB EXCITATION DATA ANALYSIS

The analysis of the Coulomb excitation data and ex-
traction of electromagnetic matrix elements utilizes the
angular dependence of the diﬀerential Coulomb excita-
tion cross sections. For this purpose, the data were sub-
divided into various ranges of scattering angles as mea-

sured with the DSSSD. It was found that a division into
ﬁve angular bins represents a good compromise between
the maximum number of data points for diﬀerential cross
sections and the minimum level of statistics in the spectra
corresponding to each angular bin. The resulting spec-
tra for ﬁve angular ranges and with Doppler correction
for γ-ray emission from the 140Sm projectiles are shown
in Fig. 7. The spectra reveal how the relative strengths
of the 4+

quire two-step excitations, change with scattering angle
compared to the 2+

The coupled channel code GOSIA [32, 33] was used to
extract the electromagnetic matrix elements. The pro-
gram combines semi-classical Coulomb excitation calcu-
lations with a multidimensional ﬁtting procedure of the
matrix elements. In this procedure, the set of matrix el-
ements is found that best reproduces the measured γ-ray
intensities observed for the diﬀerent ranges of scattering
angles, taking into account the geometry and eﬃciency
of both particle and γ-ray detectors. Known lifetimes,
branching ratios, and mixing ratios can be included in
the χ2 minimization. The γ-ray yields are obtained by
integrating the Coulomb excitation cross section over the
range of scattering angles covered by the experiment and
integrating over the range of projectile energies resulting
from the energy loss in the target. The measured γ-ray
intensities were corrected for the relative eﬃciency values
obtained from source calibrations. Finally, the correlated
uncertainties were calculated for the set of reduced tran-
sitional and diagonal matrix elements.

To convert the measured γ-ray intensities into absolute
cross sections, it is possible to normalize to the elastic
Rutherford cross section obtained from particle-singles
events. However, this requires precise knowledge of the
particle detector eﬃciency, dead time, and beam inten-
sity. The latter is often diﬃcult to obtain with good pre-
cision in experiments with weak radioactive ion beams.
In cases where the lifetime of one or more excited states
are known, the corresponding reduced matrix element
can be used to obtain absolute cross sections in the nor-
malization procedure. Without prior knowledge of ma-
trix elements, a diﬀerent normalization technique is re-
quired. The GOSIA2 code [33, 34] was developed to allow
for the simultaneous analysis of both projectile and tar-
get excitation, using known reduced matrix elements for
the scattering partners in the normalization. The ratio of
observed transitions from the projectiles Np and the tar-
get Nt is independent of the particle detection eﬃciency
ǫpart and the time-integrated luminosity L, as seen in

grated cross sections for projectile and target excitation,
respectively.

Two approaches were used in the data analysis from
the current 140Sm Coulomb excitation experiment. Since
the low-spin structure of 140Sm was initially unknown,
the ﬁrst approach was based on the normalization to the
target excitation. After the measurement of the lifetime
of the 2+
1 state in 140Sm [15] it was also possible to use
the resulting B(E2) value for normalization. A detailed
description of both analysis approaches is presented be-
low.

A. Normalization to the target excitation

Several criteria had to be considered for the choice of
the target material in the Coulomb excitation experi-
ment. Since the energy of the REX post-accelerator is
limited to 3 A MeV, high-Z materials are disadvanta-
geous because they would lead to large distances between
the scattering partners and consequently to low cross sec-
tions. The mass of the target nucleus also has to be suf-
ﬁciently diﬀerent from the mass of the projectile to avoid
ambiguities in the kinematics and ensure suﬃcient sep-
aration between the projectile and target nuclei in the
plot of the particle energy as a function of scattering an-

gle (c.f. Fig. 3). The energies of the γ-ray transitions
in the projectile and target nuclei should be well sepa-
rated to avoid overlapping peaks in the spectra. Finally,
the matrix elements for the low-lying states should be
well known to use the excitation of the target nucleus
It was found that 94Mo was a suit-
as normalization.
able target material fulﬁlling the above criteria. The rel-
evant electromagnetic matrix elements are known from
Coulomb excitation experiments with α and 16O projec-
tiles [35, 36].

As mentioned above, the observation of a transition at
204 keV in the spectrum that was Doppler corrected for
the target recoils suggests the presence of 95Mo in the
target foil. The number of 95Mo atoms, N95, relative to
the number of 94Mo atoms, N94, in the target foil can be
found as:

where YA and ǫA are the respective γ-ray yields and eﬃ-
ciencies for the 2+
1 → 0+
1 and 3/2+ → 5/2+ transitions in
the two isotopes, and the cross sections σA for the pop-
ulations of the 2+
1 and 3/2+ states that are calculated
from the known reduced matrix elements. An admixture
of 4.4(11)% 95Mo is found in this way, which is in good
agreement with the value of 5(2)% that was found in
another Coulomb excitation experiment using the same
target foil [29].

An iterative procedure with alternating use of the
codes GOSIA and GOSIA2 was employed to determine
reduced matrix elements in 140Sm with normalization to
the target excitation. The procedure, which is explained
in more detail elsewhere [34], is illustrated in Fig. 8 and
summarized below.

1. In the ﬁrst step, the standard GOSIA code is used
for 94Mo with the intensities of the 2+
1 tran-
sition as input data and the known reduced matrix
elements included as spectroscopic data.
In this
way an initial set of normalization factors was ob-
tained.

1 i and h2+

2. In the second step, the code GOSIA2 was used to
simultaneously ﬁt the reduced matrix elements in
both 140Sm and 94Mo. The purpose of this step
was to obtain a ﬁrst estimate of the h0+
1 kE2k2+
1 i
matrix element in 140Sm. Therefore only the ma-
trix elements h0+
1 i and
the γ-ray intensities for the 2+
1 transition
were included for 140Sm (c.f. Fig. 8a). To min-
imize the inﬂuence of multistep Coulomb excita-
tion, only data for θCM < 100◦ were included in
this step. With the high level of statistics for the
1 → 0+
2+
1 transition, the data could be divided into
ten angular ranges for this step, resulting in a bet-
ter sensitivity for the h2+
1 i matrix element.
The measured intensities for this subdivision of the
data are given in Table II. With the normalization
from step 1 as starting values, the χ2 minimiza-
tion yielded a new set of normalization factors and
the h0+
1 i matrix elements
for 140Sm. Fig. 9 shows the two-dimensional χ2
map for the two samarium matrix elements. Their
uncertainties were obtained from the contour for

3. In the third step, the standard GOSIA code was
used for 140Sm. The h0+
1 i matrix element
obtained in step 2 and its uncertainty were treated
as known spectroscopic data, whereas all other rel-
evant matrix elements, h2+

1 kE2k4+
1 i,
1 kE2k2+
h2+
1 kE2k2+

treated as free parameters (c.f. Fig. 8b).
In this
step the γ-ray intensities from the division into ﬁve
bins covering the entire angular range (c.f. Table
I) were used to ensure suﬃcient statistics for the
4+
1 → 2+
1 transitions. An upper limit
was included for the unobserved 2+
1 transi-
tion. This step yielded a ﬁrst realistic estimate of
all relevant reduced matrix elements in 140Sm.

4. In the fourth step, the code GOSIA2 was again
used for simultaneous χ2 minimization of reduced
matrix elements in 140Sm and 94Mo. Only the
h0+
1 kE2k2+
1 i matrix elements in
140Sm were treated as free parameters; all other
matrix elements for 140Sm were ﬁxed to the values

from the previous step (c.f. Fig. 8c). The γ-ray in-
tensities from the division into ﬁve angular ranges
were included for all observed transitions. This step
yielded more realistic values for h0+
1 i and
h2+
1 kE2k2+
1 i, since eﬀects from coupling to higher-
lying states were taken into account. Uncertainties
for the free matrix elements were again taken from
min + 1 contour in the χ2 map. In addition, a
the χ2
new set of normalization factors was obtained.

1 kE2k2+

Steps three and four of the GOSIA-GOSIA2 iteration
procedure were then repeated until the ﬁnal solution sta-
bilized. Overall uncertainties of all determined matrix el-
ements were calculated by using the GOSIA code as the
last stage of the data analysis. The resulting reduced ma-
trix elements are presented in Table III. Reduced transi-
tion probabilities and spectroscopic quadrupole moments
can be extracted from the transitional and diagonal ma-
trix elements, respectively, using the following relations:

where hII20|IIi is a Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient. The

no reliable value could be extracted. The h2+
2 kE2k0+

with an upper limit for the intensity of the transition,

B. Normalization to the lifetime of the 2+

1 state

1 kE2k2+

The lifetime of the 2+

1 state in 140Sm was recently mea-
sured to be 9.1(6) ps in an experiment using the recoil-
distance Doppler shift technique [15]. The resulting ma-
trix element, h0+
1 i = 1.03(3) eb, can be used to
normalize the Coulomb excitation data instead of nor-
malizing to the excitation of the 94Mo target nuclei. In
this case, the lifetime is included as an additional data
point in the χ2 minimization within the standard GOSIA
code. The χ2 minimization is equivalent to step 3 in the
iterative procedure described in section III A and illus-
trated in Fig. 8. The reduced matrix elements obtained
in this way are presented in Table IV. Note that the ob-
tained matrix element h0+
1 i diﬀer slightly from
the value corresponding to the lifetime used as normaliza-
tion. This is possible since the matrix element is allowed
to vary in the χ2 minimization to best ﬁt all available
data.

The resulting B(E2; 2+

value from the lifetime measurement and is slightly
smaller than the value obtained using the target normal-

1 → 0+

1 state with the 2+

ization approach. It is interesting to note that the ma-
2 and 4+
trix elements connecting the 2+
1
states are hardly aﬀected and the values obtained with
the lifetime normalization are almost identical to the ones
obtained with target normalization. The quadrupole mo-
ment for the 2+
1 state becomes slightly more negative
when normalizing to the lifetime. However, the value is
still rather small and the two results agree well within
their uncertainty.

1 kE2k0+

The small discrepancy between the two normalization
approaches for the h2+
1 i matrix element could be
due to unaccounted-for systematic errors. One possible
source for such errors could be unknown target impuri-
ties. The discrepancy could also be due to systematic
errors for the lifetime of the 2+
1 state in 140Sm or for the
matrix elements in the 94Mo target nucleus.

C. State at 990 keV

In an earlier β decay experiment the state at 990 keV
excitation energy was tentatively assigned to have spin-
parity I π = (0+) [13], but a more recent experiment re-
vised this result and ﬁrmly assigned spin-parity I π = 2+
to this state [14]. In the early stages of the analysis of
the present Coulomb excitation experiment, the spin as-
signment for the state at 990 keV was not yet resolved,
and the complete analysis, using both target and life-
time normalization approaches as described above, was
performed with the assumption that the state at 990 keV
had spin-parity 0+. The results concerning the 2+
1 and
4+
1 states were almost identical to the ones presented in
Tables III and IV. However, the h0+
1 i matrix el-
ement yielded B(E2; 0+
1 ) = 1.02(15) e2b2, which
corresponds to 236 Weisskopf units. This very large tran-
sition probability was diﬃcult to understand, and moti-
vated the new experiment to measure the spin of the state
at 990 keV using γ − γ angular correlations. This experi-
ment also found that the 2+
1 transition is of almost
pure E2 character with only a very small M 1 admixture
[14].

IV. DISCUSSION

1 kE2k0+

The values using the target normalization approach
are in good agreement with those obtained by normal-
izing to the measured lifetime of the 2+
1 state. Only for
the h2+
1 i reduced matrix element is a discrepancy
of 1.8σ found between the two techniques. Both the tar-
get and lifetime normalization techniques rely on data
from independent measurements. The former approach
relies on reduced matrix elements for the 94Mo target
nucleus measured in separate Coulomb excitation exper-
iments [35, 36], whereas the latter relies on the lifetime
of the 2+
1 state in the 140Sm projectiles from a recoil-
distance Doppler shift measurement [15]. Without any
obvious weaknesses in either approach or independent

9

measurement, it is diﬃcult to choose which results should
be trusted more. We therefore adopt the average values
from the two normalization methods for the following dis-
cussion. The adopted B(E2) values are shown in Table
V together with results from various theoretical calcula-
tions. The experimental excitation energies of the states
are compared to the theoretical calculations in Fig.10.

A. Geometric models

The spectroscopic quadrupole moment for the 2+

1 state
is consistent with zero, although the uncertainty is large.
The spherical shape is inconsistent with an interpreta-
tion of the ground-state band as a rotational excitation
with axial symmetry. An average spherical shape could
indicate a quadrupole vibrational nature of the 2+
1 state.
However, the B(E2; 4+
1 → 2+
1 ) value is only insigniﬁ-
cantly larger than the B(E2; 2+
1 → 0+
1 ) value, and not
twice as large as would be required for a harmonic vibra-
tion. The energy ratio E(4+
1 ) = 2.35 is typical for
a transitional nucleus between spherical and deformed
shape. The fact that 140Sm has a very low lying 2+
2
state supports the notion of triaxiality. Indeed, earlier
investigations of the level structure of 140Sm have found
that triaxial rotor calculations with moment of inertia pa-
rameters obtained from Woods-Saxon calculations could
reproduce the excitation spectrum reasonably well [12].
As a ﬁrst approach, it seems therefore natural to inter-
pret the electromagnetic matrix elements within the sim-
ple triaxial rotor model, although its applicability for a
weakly deformed even-even nucleus is not evident.

found for maximum triaxiality of γ = 30◦, where the 2+

state is at twice the energy of the 2+

tally, the energy of the 2+
2 state in 140Sm is found to be
even lower with E(2+

that γ = 30◦ should be used for the triaxial rotor model.
For maximum triaxiality, the spectroscopic quadrupole
moment Qs(2+

present experimental result. Furthermore, the relative
E2 strength of the 2+

be B(E2; 2+

good agreement with the experimental value of 1.52(25).
This transition should only have a very small M 1 com-
ponent, which is again consistent with the present result
and the M 1/E2 mixing ratio extracted from the angular
correlation measurement [14]. The 2+
1 transition is
strictly forbidden in the triaxial rotor model for γ = 30◦.
The experimental upper limit, B(E2; 2+
1 ) < 0.001
e2b2, is indeed very low. The experimental energy ra-
tio E(4+
1 ) = 2.35 is somewhat smaller than the
value of 2.67 predicted by the Davydov-Filippov model,
whereas the ratio B(E2; 4+
1 ) =
1.30(14) agrees within errors with the expected value of
1.43.

The good agreement between the experimental relative

transition strengths and the predictions of the triaxial
rotor model for γ = 30◦, in particular for the 2+
2 state,
suggests that the triaxial degree of freedom is important
to understand the structure of the low-lying states in
140Sm.
It should be noted, however, that the relative
B(E2) strengths for surface vibrations in nuclei with γ-
independent potential [38] are the same as for a triax-
ial rigid rotor.
Indeed, it was found earlier that mod-
els based on the Wilets-Jean Hamiltonian are able to
describe transitional nuclei in this mass region reason-
ably well [39]. Experimentally it is diﬃcult to distinguish
between γ-soft vibrational and γ-rigid rotational excita-
tions. Coulomb excitation experiments are in principle
able to distinguish between the two modes of excitation
by providing complete sets of E2 matrix elements, which
can be used to evaluate E2 invariants by summing over
rotationally invariant zero-coupled products of E2 matrix
elements [26]. Higher-order products are not only sensi-
tive to the centroid, but also to the ﬂuctuation widths of
the E2 invariants. In practice, the technique is very chal-
lenging as incomplete knowledge of the matrix elements
can strongly aﬀect the results in particular for the higher-
order products. The E2 matrix elements obtained in this
work are insuﬃcient to attempt an analysis of rotational
invariants.

The best signature to distinguish between γ softness
and γ rigidity is the energy staggering of the states in
the K = 2 γ band [40]. In the extreme γ-unstable limit,
the states of the γ band form groups as (2+
γ ),
(5+
γ ) [38], whereas for a rotor with maximum tri-
axiality the staggering leads to a grouping as (2+
γ ),
(4+
γ , 5+
γ ) etc. [37]. The states of the γ band beyond the
2+
2 state are unfortunately not known for 140Sm. The
state at 1599 keV excitation energy that was tentatively
assigned as the 3+
γ state in an earlier work [12] was shown
to have spin-parity I π = 0(+) in the recent angular cor-
relation measurement [14]. The identiﬁcation of the 3+
γ
and 4+
γ states would shed more light on the character of
the axial asymmetry. Future Coulomb excitation exper-
iments at higher beam energies and with heavier targets
such as 208Pb will populate these states with higher cross
sections than the present experiment.

B. Algebraic models

Although the matrix elements related to the 2+

2 state
are well described by either γ-unstable or γ-rigid geo-
metrical models, the discrepancies for the energies of the
states indicate that these descriptions are too simple.
The interacting boson approximation (IBA) was previ-
ously applied to describe transitional nuclei in this mass
region [19]. The IBA parameters found to reproduce the
experimental excitation energies of the lowest states place
140Sm in between the spherical vibrational and the triaxi-
ally soft rotational limits of the IBA, which correspond to
the SO(6) and U(5) subalgebras, respectively. The tran-
sition between the SO(6) and U(5) dynamic symmetries
has been interpreted as a shape phase transition. At the
critical point of this shape transition, the nuclear poten-
tial can roughly be approximated by a ﬁve-dimensional
inﬁnite well, in which case the Bohr Hamiltonian can be
solved analytically and the wave functions be expressed
in terms of Bessel functions [20]. Both 134Ba and 128Xe
have been identiﬁed as good examples for this so-called
E(5) critical point symmetry [41, 42]. The predictions of
the E(5) description for excitation energies and transition
probabilities are parameter free except for overall scaling
factors. To compare experimental data with the E(5)
predictions, excitation energies and transition strengths
are usually normalized to the energy of the 2+
1 state and
the B(E2; 2+

1 ) value, respectively.

The nucleus 140Sm has not been considered as a candi-
date for E(5) critical point symmetry, mostly because of
the previous assignment of the 990 keV level as a 0+ state,
which would be incompatible, and because experimental
B(E2) values were lacking. With the unambiguous iden-
tiﬁcation of the states at 990 and 1599 keV as 2+ and 0+
states, respectively [14], and with the transition strengths
obtained in this work, the hypothesis of 140Sm as a can-
didate for E(5) critical point behavior can be evaluated.

E(4+

somewhat larger and smaller than the E(5) predictions,
respectively. For the B(E2) values, the E(5) model
ﬁnds ratios of B(E2; 4+
1 ) =
B(E2; 2+
1 ) = 1.56 when us-
ing the E2 operator of the IBA [43]. The experimen-
tal B(E2) values obtained in the present work yield
B(E2; 4+
1 ) = 1.30(14) and
B(E2; 2+
It has
been argued that the excitation energies and decay pat-
terns of excited 0+ states provide a more stringent test
of possible E(5) behavior than the properties of the 4+
1
and 2+
In the E(5) description, the states
I π
ξτ are characterized by the quantum numbers ξ and
τ , which are related to the zeros of the Bessel func-
tions [20]. The 0+ state with ξ = 2 and τ = 0, 0+
20,
should be the lowest in energy with E(0+
1 ) =
3.03, and it should decay predominantly to the 2+
1 state
with a branching ratio B(E2; 0+

bers ξ = 1 and τ = 3 with E(0+

B(E2; 0+

tally, the lowest excited 0+ state is found at an excita-
tion energy of 1599 keV with E(0+
2 )/E(2+
1 ) = 3.01 and
B(E2; 0+
2 → 2+
1 ) = 2.88 [14]. Two
more states with tentative 0+ assignment were reported
at excitation energies of 1629 keV (E(0+
1 ) = 3.07)
and 1933 keV (E(0+
1 ) = 3.64). Both states were
observed to decay only to the 2+

it could be associated with the ξ = 1, τ = 3 state of
the E(5) model, although the branching ratio would be
expected to be even more in favor of the 2+
2 state. The
0+
3 state at 1629 keV would then be a candidate for the
ξ = 2, τ = 0 state based on its excitation energy and
decay to the 2+

Although 140Sm shows several features expected for
a nucleus with E(5) symmetry, there are also deviations
from the expected energy and B(E2) ratios. The as-
sumption of a nuclear potential that is independent of
the deformation parameters β and γ is clearly too simple
to describe the low-lying states in 140Sm. The excitation
spectrum of 140Sm has been reasonably well described in
the past using the IBA, including the presence of a low-
lying 2+
1 state [12]. To investigate
whether the IBA can also reproduce the measured tran-
sition strengths, calculations were performed using the
proton-neutron version of the model, IBA-2, with the
same set of parameters as in previous investigations (pa-
rameter set 2 from Ref. [12]). The resulting excitation
spectrum is indeed very similar to the one correspond-
ing to E(5) symmetry (c.f. Fig. 10), with the degeneracy
of the multiplets only slightly lifted. However, this near

2 state below the 4+

degeneracy is not observed experimentally.

Eﬀective charges of eν = 0.12 and eπ = 0.13 for neu-

values for the eﬀective charges are similar to those found
in previous investigations for this mass region [19]. The
resulting B(E2) values, which are included in Table V,
are in good agreement with the experimental values. Fur-
thermore, also the IBA-2 calculations ﬁnd a vanishing
B(E2; 2+

ratio B(E2; 0+

the same order of magnitude as the experimental value

concluded that the interacting boson approximation is
able to reproduce the excitation spectrum and transition
strengths of 140Sm reasonably well. However, the model
relies on parameter ﬁtting and eﬀective charges to achieve
this agreement, and its predictive power is therefore lim-
ited.

C. Shell model

Large scale shell model calculations have been carried
out including the 0g7/2, 1d5/2, 1d3/2, 2s1/2 and 1h11/2 va-
lence space for both protons and neutrons above a closed
100Sn core. The eﬀective GCN5082 [44] interaction is a
realistic renormalized G-matrix with phenomenological
monopole constraints, which has been used previously
for the description of both low-lying and high-spin struc-
tures of nuclei with 50 ≤ N, Z ≤ 82 [45–47]. The nucleus
140Sm with 12 valence protons and 28 valence neutrons
constitutes a numerical challenge for shell model calcula-
tions at the limit of our present computing capability (m-
scheme dimension ∼ 1.86 × 1011), using the parallelized
version of the Nathan shell-model code [48]. To reduce
the basis dimension we introduce a truncation scheme
with respect to the 1h11/2 orbital excitations, allowing
all neutron excitations and up to 4 proton excitations to
the 1h11/2 orbital.

The energies of the low-lying states obtained in the
shell model calculations are shown and compared to ex-
perimental data in Fig. 10.
In general, a rather good
agreement is found for both yrast and yrare states. The
calculations reproduce the correct ordering of the states
and in particular a low-lying 2+
2 state. Transition rates
were calculated using eﬀective charges of 0.65e and 1.65e
for neutrons and protons, respectively. The results are
included in Table V and the B(E2) values show a good
agreement with the experimental data. Several features
found for the 2+
1 states support their interpre-
tation as members of a K = 2 γ vibrational band: The
quadrupole moments for the 2+
2 states are almost
equal but of opposite sign, the quadrupole moment for
the 3+
1 state is approximately zero, and it decays to the

2 state via a strong E2 transition.
Constrained Hartee-Fock calculations performed with
the same shell-model Hamiltonian within the same va-
lence space reveal the presence of a triaxial mininum at
β ∼ 0.16 and γ = 26.5◦ as shown in Fig. 11. The poten-
tial energy surface is consistent with both the geomet-
rical interpretation of the data and the electromagnetic
matrix elements obtained in the shell model calculations.
The shell model calculations support the notion of triax-
ial deformation as the most salient feature of the 140Sm
nucleus, with a well-developed γ− soft band built on the
2+
2 state that is dominated by 2p2h proton excitations.

D. Beyond mean ﬁeld model

We have calculated the energies of the low-lying states
and the transition strengths between them using micro-
scopic calculations based on constrained Hartree-Fock-
Bogoliubov (CHFB) theory using the Gogny D1S inter-
action [49, 50] and mapping to the ﬁve-dimensional col-
lective Hamiltonian (5DCH) for quadrupole excitations
at low energy. The method has been described in detail
elsewhere [2], and results for the B(E2; 2+
1 ) val-
ues for the chain of neutron-deﬁcient even-even samar-
ium isotopes were presented in the context of the recent
lifetime measurement in 140Sm [15], where it was demon-
strated that the calculations are able to correctly describe
the onset of quadrupole collectivity for the samarium iso-
topes below the N = 82 shell closure. It should be noted
that the CHFB+5DCH calculations contain no free pa-
rameters except for those specifying the phenomenolog-
ical D1S interaction, which is globally used across the
entire nuclear chart. Fig. 12 shows the potential energy

1 → 0+

surface obtained from the CHFB calculations. A shallow
minimum is found for quadrupole deformation parame-
ters hβi = 0.17 and hγi = 29◦. The potential energy
surface reveals considerable γ softness.

The excitation spectrum for 140Sm obtained in the
CHFB+5DCH calculations for all positive-parity states
up to the 6+
1 state is included in Fig. 10. The general fea-
tures of the excitation spectrum are well reproduced. The
energies of the states in the ground-state band are overes-
timated by 10-15%. It has been noted previously that the
excitation energy of excited 0+ states are systematically
overpredicted [2]. This is also the case for 140Sm, where
the discrepancy is approximately 30%. The 2+
2 state is
found to have predominant K = 2 character, consistent
with a γ-vibrational excitation. The calculations repro-
duce the relative position of the 2+
2 state slightly below
the 4+
2 states can be interpreted as
members of the K = 2 γ band. The energy spacing of the
states in the γ band is consistent with a γ-soft potential
as evidenced by the potential energy surface.

The calculated B(E2) values are presented in Table V.
The comparison with the experimental values shows very
good agreement. The calculations ﬁnd almost identical
B(E2) values for the 4+
1 transitions
and an almost vanishing B(E2) value for the 2+
2 → 0+
1
transition, consistent both with the experimental results
and the geometric interpretation of maximum triaxial-
ity. The calculated quadrupole moment for the 2+
1 state
is Qs(2+
1 ) = −0.12 eb, corresponding to a very small
prolate deformation, in good agreement with the exper-
imental value. The calculated quadrupole moment for
the 2+
2 ) = +0.12 eb, has the same mag-
nitude and opposite sign compared to the quadrupole
moment of the 2+
1 state, Qs(2+
1 ), giving further support
for the interpretation of the 2+
2 state as the head of a
γ-vibrational band. As expected for such a band, the 3+
1

2 state, Qs(2+

13

state decays predominantly to the 2+
2 state and has an
almost vanishing quadrupole moment, Qs(3+
1 ) = −0.01
eb. As a whole, the calculations support the simple ge-
ometric picture of 140Sm as a nucleus with pronounced
triaxiality and γ softness and provide a fully microscopic
foundation for this interpretation.

V. SUMMARY

A low-energy Coulomb excitation experiment to study
electromagnetic transition probabilities and spectro-
scopic quadrupole moments in 140Sm was performed at
the REX-ISOLDE facility at CERN. A quasi-pure beam
of 140Sm was produced by proton-induced spallation of a
primary tantalum target followed by resonant laser ion-
ization. The radioactive ions were accelerated to an en-
ergy of 2.85A MeV and scattered on a secondary 94Mo
target. Scattered projectiles and recoiling target nuclei
were detected in a highly segmented silicon detector at
forward angles, while γ rays were measured with the
MINIBALL array of segmented HPGe detectors. The
code GOSIA was used to extract transitional and di-
agonal electromagnetic matrix elements from the γ-ray
yields observed as a function of scattering angle. By nor-
malizing the yields to known reduced matrix elements
for the 94Mo target and the known lifetime of the 2+
1
state, it was possible to determine several B(E2) values
for transitions between low-lying states and the spectro-
scopic quadrupole moment of the 2+

1 state in 140Sm.

The experimental electromagnetic matrix elements
were compared to the results of large-scale shell model
calculations and to calculations based on constrained
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory using the Gogny D1S
interaction and mapping to a ﬁve-dimensional collec-
tive Hamiltonian. A clear picture emerges from the
comparison between experimental and theoretical re-
sults that relate the observed structures in 140Sm to a
weak quadrupole deformation with maximum triaxility
of γ ≈ 30◦ and signiﬁcant γ softness. The analysis of
the excitation spectrum and the transition probabilities
using the interacting boson model suggests that 140Sm
exhibits many of the features expected for a nucleus with
approximate E(5) critical point symmetry.

To learn more about the degree of γ softness it would
be desireable to identify the states of the γ vibrational
band beyond the 2+
2 state and to measure transition prob-
abilities connected to the states in the γ vibrational band
and to the excited 0+ states. With the higher beam ener-
gies provided by the new HIE-ISOLDE post-accelerator
and the resulting higher cross sections, such measure-
ments will become feasible in the future.
