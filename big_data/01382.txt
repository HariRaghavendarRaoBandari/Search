Abstract

An r-gentiling is a dissection of a shape into r ≥ 2 parts which are all similar to the original
shape. An r-reptiling is an r-gentiling of which all parts are mutually congruent. By applying
gentilings recursively, together with a rule that deﬁnes an order on the parts, one may obtain an
order in which to traverse all points within the original shape. We say such a traversal is a face-
continuous space-ﬁlling curve if, at any level of recursion, the interior of the union of any set of
consecutive parts is connected—that is, consecutive parts must always meet along an edge. Most
famously, the isosceles right triangle admits a 2-reptiling, which forms the basis of the face-continuous
Sierpi´nski space-ﬁlling curve; many other right triangles admit reptilings and gentilings that yield
face-continuous space-ﬁlling curves as well. In this study we investigate what acute triangles admit
non-trivial reptilings and gentilings, and whether these can form the basis for face-continuous space-
ﬁlling curves. We derive several properties of reptilings and gentilings of acute (sometimes also
obtuse) triangles, leading to the following conclusion: no face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve can be
constructed on the basis of reptilings of acute triangles.

1 Introduction

1.1 Reptilings, gentilings and space-ﬁlling curves

Reptilings and gentilings We call a geometric ﬁgure, that is, a set of points in Euclidean space, T
an r-gentile if T admits an r-gentiling, that is, a subdivision of T into r ≥ 2 ﬁgures (tiles) T1, ..., Tr, such
that each of the ﬁgures T1, ..., Tr is similar to T . In other words, T is a r-gentile if we can tile it with r
smaller copies of itself. This generalizes the concept of reptiles, coined by Golomb [3]: a ﬁgure T is an
r-reptile if T admits an r-reptiling, that is, a subdivision of T into r ≥ 2 ﬁgures T1, ..., Tr, such that each
of the ﬁgures T1, ..., Tr is similar to T and all ﬁgures T1, ..., Tr are mutually congruent. In other words,
T is a r-reptile if we can tile it with r equally large smaller copies of itself.

Traversal orders
If we augment the deﬁnitions of gentilings with an order on the tiles, we can use
gentilings to deﬁne a mapping f from the unit interval [0, 1) to a gentile T , such that the closure of the
image of f is all of T and such that f is measure-preserving (up to uniform scaling). In other words, the
image of an interval [a, b) ⊆ [0, 1) is a set T (cid:48) ⊆ T such that |T (cid:48)| = (b− a)|T|, where we use |X| to denote
the Lebesgue measure (area) of X. We call such a mapping a traversal order. An example is illustrated
in Figure 1. The ﬁgure shows how, by simultaneously subdividing intervals and triangular tiles, while
maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between intervals and tiles, we can get an arbitrarily precise
approximation of a mapping f from [0, 1) to a triangle.

total size of the tiles before Ti, that is, ai = (cid:80)i−1

In general, a traversal order for a gentile T could be deﬁned recursively as follows. Suppose we are
given a gentiling of T with tiles T1, ..., Tr, with corresponding traversal orders f1, ..., fr. Let ai be the
j=1 |Tj|. Then we deﬁne a traversal order f for T by
f (x) = fi((x − ai)/(ai+1 − ai)) where i is the maximum i such that ai ≤ x. In other words, we deﬁne f
by transforming the domains of f1, ..., fr so that their domains become consecutive and cover [0, 1). Note
that the base case of the recursion is missing. A practical solution is to require that f is order-preserving

curve through the tiles in each ﬁgure illustrates the order in which the tiles are traversed.

and self-similar, that is, we deﬁne each of the traversal orders fi to be equal to ti ◦ f , where ti is a
similarity transformation that transforms T into Ti. (In Figure 1, these transformations are depicted by
showing, in each tile, the image of a letter R in the initial triangle.) The traversal order f is then the
unique solution of the equation f (x) = ti(f ((x − ai)/(ai+1 − ai))), where i is the maximum i such that
ai ≤ x. One may also consider reversing the direction of the traversal within certain tiles as compared to
the traversal of T , resulting in a traversal that is self-similar but not order-preserving. A more general
solution is to require that for any tile Ti in a gentiling of T , we have some way of choosing a gentiling
T to subdivide Ti and to choose an order on the tiles of T . This enables us to approximate f to any
desired level of accuracy.

Space-ﬁlling curves We may extend the domain of a traversal order to [0, 1] by deﬁning f (1) =
limx↑1 f (x). A measure-preserving space-ﬁlling curve is a traversal order that is continuous. This can
be achieved by choosing the order of the tiles in the gentilings that are applied carefully, to ensure that
we have fi(1) = fi+1(0), for 1 ≤ i < r. In the case of order-preserving self-similar curves, this can be
rewritten as ti(f (1)) = ti+1(f (0)). The existence of space-ﬁlling curves for two-dimensional tiles was ﬁrst
demonstrated by Peano [10]. Since then, various space-ﬁlling curves have been deﬁned (see, for example,
Sagan [12]). The example in Figure 1 describes the well-known Sierpi´nski curve.

At this point we can also deﬁne formally what it means for a space-ﬁlling curve f with image T to
be based on a reptiling or gentiling. We say f is based on a gentiling if there is an inﬁnite sequence of
gentilings T1,T2, ... of T , such that (i) each gentiling Ti+1, for i ≥ 1, can be obtained by subdividing the
tiles of Ti by a gentiling, and (ii) the curve f traverses the tiles of each gentiling Ti one by one. We say
f is based on a reptiling if there is a natural number r such that T1 and the gentilings that are applied
to the tiles of each Ti to obtain Ti+1 are r-reptilings. Note that we do not require these r-reptilings to
be similar to each other, we only require them to have the same number of tiles r.

Face-continuous space-ﬁlling curves Observe that on any level of recursion that deﬁnes the Sierpi´nski
curve, each pair of triangles that are consecutive in the order share an edge. This property is captured by
the concept of face-continuity: we say a space-ﬁlling curve f is face-continuous if it is measure-preserving
and the interior of the image of any interval under f is a connected set. (The word “face-continuity” stems
from its use in the three-dimensional setting, where it captures the fact that each pair of consecutive
polyhedral tiles shares a two-dimensional face.)

1.2 Reptilings and space-ﬁlling curves based on triangles: our results

Problem statement Several space-ﬁlling curves have been described in the literature, and they diﬀer
in usefulness, depending on the application. For example, the Lebesgue curve [8] (the curve underlying
Morton indexing [9]), the Hilbert curve [5], and the Sierpi´nski curve have all been used for applications in
which the other two curves would not work as well [4, 7, 11]. Thus there is a general interest in exploring
the space of possible space-ﬁlling curves for curves with potentially useful properties.

One particular use of the Sierpi´nski curve is in the construction and traversal of two-dimensional
triangular meshes as described by Bader and Zenger [1]. The Sierpi´nski curve is particularly well-suited
for this application for two reasons. First, the curve is face-continuous, which was exploited by Bader
and Zenger to reduce the number of stack operations in their algorithm. Second, the curve is based on
a reptiling of triangles that are reasonably well-shaped for use as elements in a computational mesh:

the smallest angles of the triangles are not that small; their largest angles are not that large; and their
longest edges are not that long (relative to the square root of the area of a triangle). However, the shape
of the right triangles of the Sierpi´nski curve is not optimal in these respects: (certain) acute triangles
would be better. This raises the question whether one can construct a face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve
based on reptilings with acute triangles, which could then replace the Sierpi´nski curve in the traversal
method described by Bader and Zenger [1]. This paper investigates that question.

We may address this question in three stages. First, what triangles are r-reptiles for what r? Second,
what tilings are admitted by those triangles? Third, which of these tilings support the deﬁnition of a
face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve?

What triangles are reptiles? The answer to the ﬁrst question is known: it is known what triangles
are r-reptiles for what r. To start with, every triangle T admits an n2-reptiling for any natural n. Such
a tiling is achieved as follows: we divide every side of T into n segments of equal length, and then we
draw all lines that are parallel to the sides of T and contain an endpoint of one of the segments, see
Figure 2(a). We will call the resulting subdivision of T the trivial n2-reptiling. In fact, we can also use
such reptilings to obtain various gentilings. By merging some of the tiles into a larger triangle, we can
obtain an r-gentiling of T for any r ≥ 6, as shown by Freese et al. [2], see Figure 2(b,c). We will call
such gentilings trivial as well, that is, a gentiling is trivial if there is an underlying set of triangles in
a regular grid pattern as described above, such that each tile is a union of triangles from this grid. As
far as the value of r goes, these are the only possibilities for acute triangles: acute triangles admit an
r-reptiling if and only if r is square, and they admit an r-gentiling if and only if r is a positive natural
number other than 2, 3, or 5 (for further references, see Inset 1).

Inset 1 Which triangles are r-gentiles and r-reptiles for what r?
As shown by Freese et al. [2] and illustrated by Figure 2(b,c), each triangle is an r-gentile if r = 4 or r ≥ 6. Figure (a) below
shows a 4-gentiling that is non-trivial for any non-equilateral triangle. Figure (b) below shows that each right triangle is
a 2-gentile, and thus, by repeatedly subdividing a single tile, one can get an r-gentiling of a right triangle for any r ≥ 2.
Freese et al. [2] also showed that no oblique triangle is a 2-gentile or a 3-gentile, and Kaiser [6] proved that the only oblique
triangle that is a 5-gentile is the isosceles triangle with top angle 2π/3; the tiling is shown in Figure 13(d).

Snover et al. [13] showed that a triangle T is an r-reptile if and only if at least one of the following conditions is satisﬁed: (i)
r is a square number; (ii) T is a right triangle with angle α and there are natural numbers l and m such that tan α = l/m
and r = l2 + m2; (iii) T is a right triangle with angles π/6, π/3 and π/2 and r/3 is square. Examples of corresponding
reptilings are illustrated in Figure 2(a), Figure (c) above, and Figure (d) above, respectively, but alternative tilings with
the same numbers of tiles may exist.

Can you rearrange the triangles in the above ﬁgure to form a single triangle? You may need to ﬂip some
pieces over.

What reptilings are possible? The answer to the second question is not known: although we know
what triangles admit at least one r-reptiling, we do not know of a full characterization of triangles that
admit non-trivial r-reptilings. Inset 1 shows some non-trivial reptilings and gentilings but this ﬁgure
certainly does not illustrate all possibilities. The reader who would like to get some experience with
non-trivial tilings, may try to solve the puzzle in Inset 2 before reading on (at least one solution is a
gentiling, which could be reﬁned into a reptiling by cutting up the pieces of the puzzle further).
In
Section 3 we obtain the following result:

Theorem 1. If T is an acute triangle, there exists a non-trivial reptiling of T if and only if T has a
pair of sides with lengths a and b, such that b/a is a rational number p/q where p (cid:54)= q.

We are interested in the question what non-trivial reptilings are possible for acute triangles partic-
ularly in the context of the third question: which tilings support the deﬁnition of a face-continuous
space-ﬁlling curve? Consider a reptiling T of an acute triangle T . If multiple tiles of T meet at a vertex
v of T , we say v is a fan in T . If there is only a single tile touching a vertex v of T and the interior edge
of that tile (the edge opposite to v) is a union of edges of multiple adjacent tiles, then we say v is a cap
in T . As we will see in Section 6, to construct a face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve we need tilings that
have caps or fans, but these were absent in all of the reptilings of acute triangles that we have found in
the literature. In Section 5 we prove the following result on fans (which, to some extent, also applies to
gentilings):

Theorem 2. There exists an acute triangle T that admits a reptiling in which one of the vertices of T
is adjacent to k tiles if and only if k = 1 or k = 2.

What triangular reptilings support face-continuous space-ﬁlling curves? Theorem 2 conﬁrms
the existence of reptilings of acute triangles with fans. However, in Section 6 we ﬁnd that the conditions
of Theorems 1 and 2 are suﬃciently restrictive to be able to derive the following negative result:

Theorem 3. There is no face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve whose construction is based on a reptiling
of an acute triangle.

Contents of this article Further terminology, notation, and a key lemma underlying all of our results
are introduced in Section 2. Theorem 1 is proven in Section 3. In fact, we show that this result partially
extends to obtuse triangles as well. Section 4 proves that any non-trivial reptiling of an oblique triangle
must contain points where a vertex of one tile lies on the interior of an edge of another tile. This is
ultimately without consequence for our ﬁnal results, but may be useful in solving the open problems that
remain unsolved by our work. Theorem 2 is proven in Section 5, and Theorem 3 is proven in Section 6.
We summarize our results and identify unanswered questions in Section 7.

2 Preliminaries

Let T be a triangle with corners A, B and C, and respective angles α, β and γ. Consider now a valid
r-gentiling for T with tiles T1, . . . , Tr. Call this tiling T . For more convenient description of T , we

associate with it a graph GT , which is deﬁned as follows. Each point that is a corner of one or more tiles
Ti (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) constitutes a vertex of GT , and each maximal segment of the boundary of T or the
boundary between tiles that does not contain a vertex in its interior constitutes an edge of GT . Note
that GT is a simple graph, whose vertex set also includes A, B and C.
If we consider a vertex of GT , we can classify it with respect to the number of tiles that are adjacent
to it. We call a tile adjacent to a vertex in two diﬀerent forms. A vertex v has a corner-adjacency to
some tile if v is one of the tile’s corners. On the other hand, v has an edge-adjacency to some tile if v
lies on one of the sides of this tile (and is not one of its corners). Thus we can distinguish three types of
vertices:

• The master vertices are the three vertices A, B, C—the corners of T .
• Half vertices are the vertices that either lie on the interiors of the sides of T or that have exactly
one edge-adjacency. In the latter case, that is, if the half vertex lies in the interior of T , it is also
called a hanging vertex.

• Full vertices are vertices which are not master vertices and have no edge-adjacencies.

Note that the union of these three types of vertices is the whole vertex set of GT . We now reﬁne corner-
adjacencies as follows. We say that tile Ti is ζ-adjacent to vertex v if the corner of Ti that coincides with
v is of angle ζ (with ζ taking values α, β and γ). Additionally, call degζ(v) the ζ-degree of vertex v and
let it denote the number of tiles ζ-adjacent to vertex v.

We call a triangle rational if it has at least one pair of sides such that the length of one side divided
by the length of the other is a rational number other than one. We call a triangle irrational if it is not
rational, see Figure 3

The following consequence of Euler’s formula will prove useful in the following sections:

Lemma 1. If T is an r-gentiling with f full vertices and h half vertices, we have r = 2f + h + 1.
Proof. Let e = e(GT ) be the number of edges of the graph GT . Taking into account the three master
vertices and the exterior face of the tiling, Euler’s formula gives us (f + h + 3) + (r + 1) = e + 2, or
equivalently:

2e = 2r + 2f + 2h + 4

(1)

Each face, that is, each tile as well as the exterior face, has three edges, plus one additional edge for each
half vertex that lies in the interior of a side of the face. Since each half vertex lies in the interior of a
side of only one face, the number of edges summed over all faces is therefore 3(r + 1) + h. Note that this
counts each edge twice (once from each side), so we have 2e = 3r + h + 3. Using this to substitute 2e in
Equation (1), we get the claimed equality r = 2f + h + 1.

3 Triangles that admit non-trivial reptilings

In this section we prove Theorem 1: an acute triangle admits a non-trivial reptiling if and only if it
is rational. Since the trivial reptiling has neither caps nor fans, this implies that no face-continuous
space-ﬁlling curves can be constructed based on recursively reptiling an irrational acute triangle. In fact,
as we will see below and in Section 7, the results also extend to certain classes of obtuse triangles.

Throughout this section, we maintain the following notation. We consider an n2-reptiling of a triangle
T with vertices A, B and C and respective angles α, β and γ. The sides of the T opposite of A, B, C are

denoted by BC, CA and AB, respectively, and their lengths are n · a, n · b, n · c, respectively. Hence, the
small, mutually congruent copies of T that are used to tile T have side lengths a, b and c. A single such
tile is denoted by Ti. For e ∈ {BC, CA, AB}, an e-parallel is a line parallel to e.
3.1 A non-trivial tiling of a rational triangle

We start this section by giving a construction for a non-trivial reptiling of any rational triangle, thereby
proving that rationality is a suﬃcient condition for such a reptiling to exist. Let T be a rational triangle,
and without loss of generality, assume:

p · a = q · b

(*)

for two natural numbers p > q. To ﬁnd a non-trivial tiling, we require n ≥ p + q. Now consider the trivial
n2-tiling of T . In this tiling we can ﬁnd a parallelogram where one side consists of p tile edges of length
a and another side consists of q tile edges of length b. Due to n ≥ p + q, this parallelogram must exist.
Furthermore, by (*), this parallelogram is a rhombus. We can now “ﬂip” the trivial sub-tiling inside the
rhombus, that is, mirror it at either of its axes, without interfering with the tiling outside the rhombus.
This yields the desired non-trivial tiling. Figure 4 shows an example for p = 3 and q = 2. Thus we get:

Theorem 4. If T is a triangle with a pair of sides with lengths a and b, such that b/a is a rational

number p/q, where p, q ∈ N and p (cid:54)= q, then there is a non-trivial r-reptiling of T for any square number
r ≥ (p + q)2.
3.2 All reptilings of irrational acute triangles are trivial

We will now prove the following:

Theorem 5. If T is a triangle without any pair of sides with lengths a and b, such that b/a is a rational
number other than 1, and T is (i) acute, or (ii) isosceles and oblique, then all possible reptilings of T
are trivial.

We start with the following lemma, which gives an important property of the sequences of tiles that

may meet along a line segment.

Lemma 2. Let T be an irrational scalene triangle. Then there can be only one edge length e ∈ {a, b, c}
such that a certain chain of edges of length e has the same length as a certain chain of edges of one or
two of the other lengths.

Proof. Assume there are non-zero integers λ1, µ1, ν1 such that

λ1a + µ1b + ν1c = 0.

(2)

Now, suppose there is another triple of integers (λ2, µ2, ν2) linearly independent of (λ1, µ1, ν1) such that
λ2a + µ2b + ν2c = 0. Eliminating one of the side lengths (say, c), we get that a/b is rational, which
contradicts the assumption that T is irrational. Hence there can be at most one triple (up to scaling)
satisfying Equation (2). This equation can be interpreted as follows: when Equation (2) holds, there is
exactly one edge length from {a, b, c} (namely the one whose coeﬃcient’s sign diﬀers from the other two
coeﬃcients’ signs) such that a multiple of that edge length can be covered with a combination of the
other two.

6

Figure 5: A half vertex with two ω-adjacencies, leaving an angle θ < χ.

The above lemma implies that, without loss of generality, any irrational triangle falls into exactly one

of two classes as speciﬁed by the conditions given below:

(i) There are no non-zero natural numbers λ, µ, ν such that λb = µc + νa or λc = µa + νb, and
if any edge can be written as a rational combination of the

β = min(α, β, γ) (in other words:
others; it is not the shortest edge).

(ii) There are non-zero natural numbers λ, µ, ν such that λa = µb + νc and α = min(α, β, γ) (in other

words: the shortest edge can be written as a rational combination of the other edges).

Note that class (i) includes all isosceles irrational triangles. For class (i), we will show that there can
only be the trivial n2-reptiling, provided T is oblique. For class (ii), we will show that there can only
be the trivial n2-reptiling, provided T is acute. Thus the analysis of these two classes together covers at
least all acute irrational triangles and all oblique isosceles irrational triangles.

The following observation will be useful in the analysis of both classes:

Observation 1. If χ ≤ ψ < ω are the angles of an oblique triangle (which is scalene, or isosceles with
top angle ω > π/3), and dχ, dψ, dω are non-negative integers satisfying dχ · χ + dψ · ψ + dω · ω = π, then
we have dω ≤ 1.
Proof. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, dω ≥ 2. Then, since T is not a right triangle, 2ω must be
strictly smaller than π, and further angles must be added to make π. Since χ + 2ω > χ + ψ + ω = π,
this is not possible. Therefore, dω ≤ 1.

Observation 1 and its application to a half vertex is illustrated in Figure 5.
In the analysis of both classes (i) and (ii), we will assume, without loss of generality, that the edge
BC of T is horizontal and constitutes the bottom edge of T , where B lies to the right of C. Let Bε(p) be
the ball with radius ε centered at p. We say a point p is strictly right-bounded by an e-parallel if there
exists some ε > 0 such that in the right half of Bε(p), the e-parallel through p is contained in an edge of
T . We say p is right-bounded by an e-parallel, if it is strictly right-bounded or there exists some ε > 0
such that in the right half of Bε(p), the e-parallel through p lies outside of T . Note that this right half
is well-deﬁned after ﬁxing the orientation of our triangle T .

Additionally, we say that some tile is right-adjacent to a line segment pq if two corners of the tile lie
on pq, while the third corner lies in the halfplane that is bounded on the left by the line that contains
pq.

Class (i) There are no non-zero natural numbers λ, µ, ν such that λb = µc + νa or λc = µa + νb, and
β = min(α, β, γ).

Lemma 3. (Sawtooth lemma) Let T be a reptiling of an oblique triangle T , where there are no natural
numbers λ, µ, ν such that λb = µc + νa or λc = µa + νb, and β = min(α, β, γ). Let pq be a segment of
a CA-parallel that has length k · b for some k ∈ N and is covered completely by edges of T , where p and
q are right-bounded by AB-parallels. Then the tiles of T that are right-adjacent to pq are translates of
scaled (not rotated or reﬂected) copies of T .

Proof. First note that pq cannot be covered by any other combination of edges than k edges of length b,
of tiles T1, ..., Tk (from top to bottom). If T is isosceles with α = γ, the statement immediately follows.

7

ωωθFigure 6: Illustration for Lemma 3.

In any other case, all of these edges meet, at their endpoints, an α and a γ angle of their respective tiles.
We can distinguish two cases, as illustrated in Figure 6: (1) α < γ, and (2) α > γ.

In case (1) (if T is isosceles, this means α = β < γ) the angle α between pq and the AB-parallel
through p forces T1 to be α-adjacent to p, with the larger γ-angle at the bottom. By Observation 1, two
successive tiles Ti and Ti+1 cannot be γ-adjacent to the same vertex, so, by induction, each of the tiles
Ti has the α angle at the top and the γ-angle at the bottom. This proves the lemma for this case.
In case (2) (if T is isosceles, this means γ = β < α) we claim that Tk is γ-adjacent to q.

If q
is not strictly right-bounded, this follows immediately, since q then lies on BC and we have a gap of
size γ. Otherwise, that is, if q is strictly right-bounded, suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that Tk
was α-adjacent to q. The angle π − α between pq and the AB-parallel through q now yields a gap of
π − 2α < π − α − γ = β, which no angle can ﬁll. Hence, Tk is γ-adjacent to q. By Observation 1, the
α-angles of successive tiles Ti and Ti+1 cannot meet at the same point, so inductively, each of the tiles
Ti has the γ angle at the bottom and the α-angle at the top. This proves the lemma for this case.

decreasing distance from the supporting line of BC, let the dominated region D(p1, ..., pm) be(cid:83)m

For a point p, let its dominated region D(p) be the region of T that is both to the left of the AB-
parallel and to the left of the CA-parallel through p. For any given set of points p1, ..., pm in order of
i=1 D(pi).
Let R be the largest dominated region that is tiled exactly as in the trivial tiling, and let p1, ..., pm be
the smallest set of points such that p1 lies on AB, pm lies on BC, and D(p1, ..., pm) = R, see Figure 7.
Let qi, for 1 ≤ i < m, be the intersection of the CA-parallel through pi and the AB-parallel through
pi+1. From Lemma 3, with p = A and q = C, we know that R contains at least one tile (the tile in the
corner at C), and therefore pm does not lie at C.

Now suppose that p1 (cid:54)= pm. We will prove by induction on increasing i that pi is strictly right-bounded
by an AB-parallel, which yields a contradiction. The base case i = 1 is established by deﬁnition, since
p1 lies on AB, but p1 is not the master vertex B. Now consider point pi with 1 < i < m and suppose
pi−1 is strictly right-bounded by an AB-parallel. By construction, the length of pi−1qi−1 is a multiple of
b and immediately below qi−1, the tiling T corresponds to the trivial tiling. Hence, qi−1 is also strictly
right-bounded by an AB-parallel, and by Lemma 3, a saw-tooth pattern must be placed along pi−1qi−1.
In particular, qi−1 must be γ-adjacent to a tile Xi−1 that has exactly the same orientation as T and is
also part of the trivial tiling. This only leaves room around qi−1 for one more tile Yi−1, which must be
β-adjacent to qi−1, see Figure 7. If Yi−1 shared an edge of length a with Xi−1, then Yi−1 would also be
part of the trivial tiling and R ∪ Xi−1 ∪ Yi−1 would be a dominated region that is tiled exactly as in the
trivial tiling—contradicting the deﬁnition of R as the largest such region. Therefore, an edge of length a
of Yi−1, where a (cid:54)= c, must lie on the AB-parallel through qi−1 and pi. (Note that this implies that the
triangle cannot be isosceles with a = c.) The length of qi−1pi is a multiple of c, which cannot be written
as a linear combination of tile edge lengths that includes at least one times a. Therefore, the tile edges
that are right-adjacent to qi−1pi cannot cover qi−1pi exactly and there must be a tile with an edge e
that is parallel to AB, where the interior of e contains pi. It follows that pi is also strictly right-bounded
by an AB-parallel. It remains to treat the case of i = m, but for that, we ﬁrst need to establish that
pm (cid:54)= qm−1. Indeed, we just established that pm−1 is strictly right-bounded, and from Lemma 3, we get

At q1, the hashed tile cannot be placed because it would violate the maximality of R; hence we have
to place the gray tile Y1, which results in “overshooting” at p2. Applying induction, we ﬁnd that the
conﬁguration of tiles around qm−1 induces overshooting at pm, contradicting the very existence of the
tiling.

that qm−1 is γ-adjacent to some tile which could be added to R if pm = qm−1. This would contradict
the maximality of R, so we must have pm (cid:54)= qm−1. With that in mind, we can extend our inductive
step to the case of i = m and thus get that pm is strictly right-bounded. But this cannot be true, since
pm lies on the bottom edge BC of T . Hence our assumption p1 (cid:54)= pm must be false and we must have
p1 = pm = B, that is, R includes all of D(B) = T : the complete tiling must be trivial.

Class (ii) There are non-zero natural numbers λ, µ, ν such that λa = µb + νc and α = min(α, β, γ).
The analysis of this class is a little bit more complicated, since we do not have the convenient property
anymore that Xi−1 leaves room around qi−1 for only one more tile Yi−1. Without loss of generality, we
may assume β < γ, and therefore, α < β < γ.

Observation 2. The proof for class (i) still goes through verbatim for class (ii) if α does not divide β,
since then, the angle β that is left after inserting Xi−1 at qi−1 cannot be ﬁlled with smaller angles and
can only be ﬁlled by a single tile Yi−1, as before.

It remains to analyse the case in which α divides β. We will use the following observation:

Observation 3. If α < β < γ are the angles of a scalene oblique triangle, where β/α ∈ N and γ/α /∈ N,
and dα, dβ, dγ are non-negative integers satisfying dα · α + dβ · β + dγ · γ = π, then we have dγ = 1 and
dβ ≤ 1.
Proof. We have π = α + β + γ = γ (cid:54)= 0 (mod α), while dα · α + dβ · β = 0 (mod α), so we must have
dγ ≥ 1, and therefore, by Observation 1, dγ = 1.
It follows that dβ ≤ 1, otherwise we would have
π = dα · α + dβ · β + dγ ≥ 0 + 2β + γ > α + β + γ = π.

In particular, we can make the following observation about acute triangles (in fact, this is the only

place in this section where we use the fact that T is not obtuse):

Observation 4. If α < β < γ are the angles of a scalene acute triangle, where β/α ∈ N, and dα, dβ, dγ
are non-negative integers satisfying dα · α + dβ · β + dγ · γ = π, then we have dγ = 1 and dβ ≤ 1.

(ii). The black region is R. The dark gray tiles result from the fact that the points pi are strictly
right-bounded by a CA-parallel, so these tiles have their α-angle at the bottom and their sides of length
c on piqi−1. Going bottom-up, we ﬁnd that the hashed option of placing tile X2 is not possible because it
would violate the maximality of R; hence we have to place the gray tile, which results in “overshooting”
at p2. Applying induction and working upwards, we ﬁnd that p1 is also strictly right-bounded by a
CA-parallel, contradicting the very existence of the tiling.

Proof. Let β be kα. We have π = α + β + γ > α + 2β = (2k + 1)α, but also π = 2(α + β + γ) − π <
2(α + β + π/2) − π = 2(α + β) = (2k + 2)α, so π is not a multiple of α and thus neither is γ. Hence we
have dγ = 1 and dβ ≤ 1 by Observation 3.

Now let R = D(p1, ..., pm) be deﬁned as before, and suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that
m (cid:54)= 1, and therefore, pm (cid:54)= B. For an illustration, refer to Figure 8. We will prove by induction on
decreasing i that the points pi are strictly right-bounded by CA-parallels.

We will ﬁrst establish either the case of i = m or the case of i = m − 1 as a base case.
If pm = qm−1, we choose i = m − 1 as the base case of our induction. For the sake of contradiction,
suppose pmpm−1 is covered exactly by right-adjacent tiles. Since the length of pmpm−1 is a multiple of b,
it can only be covered by edges of length b, whose respective tiles shall be called T1, . . . , Th with Th being
the tile adjacent to pm. But at pm, there is only a gap of angle γ left and since α does not divide γ, Th
must be γ-adjacent to pm and thus could be added to R, contradicting the maximality of R. Therefore,
we must conclude that pmpm−1 is not covered exactly by right-adjacent tiles, and hence pm−1 is strictly
right-bounded by a CA-parallel. This establishes the base case i = m − 1.
Otherwise, if pm (cid:54)= qm−1 (see Figure 8), we choose i = m as the base case of the induction. Vertex
pm lies on BC. The length of the line segment qm−1pm is a multiple of c, which can only be covered by
edges of length c, at the ends of which their respective tiles T1, ..., Th (from top to bottom) have angles
α and β. Since pm has a β-adjacency from the trivial tiling on the left, by Observation 4 it cannot have
another β-adjacency, and therefore it must have an α-adjacency from Th. It follows that pm is bounded
by a CA-parallel.

Having established the base case, we will now describe the induction step. Suppose pi+1 is bounded
by a CA-parallel. The length of the line segment qipi+1 is a multiple of c, which can only be covered by
edges of length c, at the ends of which their respective tiles T1, ..., Th (from top to bottom) have angles
α and β. Between qipi+1 and the CA-parallel through pi+1 there is only an angle α, and Observation 4
says that the β-angles of two tiles from T1, ..., Th cannot meet at the same point on qipi+1. Therefore
all tiles T1, ..., Th must have their α-angle at the bottom and their β-angle on the left. It follows that
qi is bounded by a BC-parallel. This leaves a gap of γ at qi. Since α does not divide γ, this can only
be ﬁlled by a tile Xi with angle γ at qi. Now the side of Xi of length b cannot lie on piqi, because then
R ∪ Xi ∪ T1 would be a dominated region that is tiled exactly as in the trivial tiling—contradicting the

the vertical edge of length d, we ﬁrst see a sequence of the ﬁrst type: d, , z, followed by one occurrence
of the sequence δ, e, δ, z, and ﬁnally , d. We then see a sequence of the second type, in which (, e) and
(ζ, z) have switched roles: ﬁrst d, ζ, e, followed by one occurrence of the sequence δ, z, δ, e, and ﬁnally

deﬁnition of R as the largest such region. Therefore, the edge of Xi that lies on piqi does not have length
b. The length of piqi is a multiple of b, which cannot be written as a linear combination of tile edge
lengths that includes at least one times a or c. Therefore, the tile edges that cover piqi from the right
cannot cover piqi exactly and must “overshoot” at pi, so that pi lies on the interior of a tile edge that is
parallel to CA. It follows that pi is also strictly right-bounded by a CA-parallel.

Thus, by induction, we ﬁnd that p1 is strictly right-bounded by a CA-parallel. But this cannot be,
since p1 lies on AB. Hence our assumption p1 (cid:54)= pm must be false and we must have p1 = pm = B, that
is, R includes all of D(B) = T : the complete tiling must be trivial.
This concludes the proof of Theorem 5, and thus, of Theorem 1: an acute triangle T admits a

non-trivial reptiling if and only if T is rational.

Intermezzo: all non-trivial reptilings of oblique triangles have
hanging vertices

From the previous section we learn that we need to focus on triangles of which the length ratio of two
sides is a rational number other than one. In the present section we will learn more about the nature of
the reptilings we need. The reader may feel free to skip this section, as the results are ultimately without
consequence for our ﬁnal results—but they can be of interest to those who would like to solve the open
problems stated in Section 7 and want to be able to quickly recognize infeasible solutions.

In this section we will prove the following theorem.

Theorem 6. Any non-trivial reptiling of an oblique triangle must have half vertices in the interior of
the triangle.

Without loss of generality, assume α ≤ β ≤ γ. We start the proof of Theorem 6 with the following

lemma.

Lemma 4. For any full vertex v in a reptiling without interior half vertices of a scalene triangle, we
have degα(v) = degβ(v) = degγ(v) (mod 2).

Proof. We consider triangles to have angles δ, , and ζ, and the lengths of the edges opposite of these
angles shall be denoted by d, e, and z, respectively. Now consider the sequence of edges and angles
incident and adjacent to a full vertex v, in clockwise order around v, starting from an arbitrary edge
incident to v and ending with that same edge (see Figure 9). We describe such a sequence by the lengths

11

dzδeδzdζeδzδeδzdddddzeeeδδδδζζζζζζζζvof the edges and the sizes of the angles. Without loss of generality, let the sequence start with d, , z. It
is now easy to verify that the initial part of the sequence up to the next occurrence of d can be completed
only in the following ways:

• d, , z; followed by zero or more occurrences of the sequence δ, e, δ, z; and ﬁnally , d;
• d, , z; followed by zero or more occurrences of the sequence δ, e, δ, z; and ﬁnally δ, e, ζ, d.

The full sequence of edges and angles incident and adjacent to v, which returns to the starting edge, is
thus composed of sequences of the two types given above, where (, e) and (ζ, z) may (but do not have
to) change roles after each occurrence of d. Note that for both types of subsequences, the number of
angles of each type (, δ and ζ) is of the same parity. The lemma follows.

Recall that from the fact that the triangles are acute and scalene, we have π/3 < γ < π/2 and

γ − β < α.
Lemma 5. Let T be a reptiling of a scalene, oblique triangle T without interior half vertices.
(i) For any full vertex v of T , we have degγ(v) ≤ 2.
(ii) For any boundary vertex u of T , we have degγ(u) ≤ 1.
Proof. (i) Let v be a full vertex in the reptiling. Because T is not equilateral, we have γ > π/3. Therefore
degγ(v) ≤ 5, so we only need to analyze the cases degγ(v) = 3, degγ(v) = 4, and degγ(v) = 5. For each
of these cases we will show that the angles meeting in v cannot sum up to 2π.
degγ(v) = 3: By Lemma 4, we know that degα(v) and degβ(v) must each be either 1 or at least 3. If
degα(v) = degβ(v) = 1, the angles around v sum up to α + β + 3γ = π + 2γ (cid:54)= 2π (since T is not
a right triangle). However, if degα(v) ≥ 3 or degβ(v) ≥ 3, the angles around v sum up to at least
3α + β + 3γ = 3(α + β + γ) − 2β > 2π.
degγ(v) = 4: By Lemma 4, we know that degα(v) and degβ(v) must each be either 0 or at least 2. If
degα(v) = degβ(v) = 0, the angles around v sum up to 4γ (cid:54)= 2π (since T is not a right triangle). However,
if degα(v) ≥ 2 or degβ(v) ≥ 2, the angles around v sum up to at least 2α + 4γ > 2α + 2β + 2γ = 2π.
degγ(v) = 5: By Lemma 4, we know that degα(v) and degβ(v) must each be at least 1. Therefore the
angles around v sum up to at least α + β + 5γ = π + 4γ > 7π/3, which is too much.
This proves part (i) of the lemma.

(ii) This is just restating Observation 1.

Lemma 6. Let T be a reptiling of a scalene, oblique triangle without interior half vertices.
(i) For any full vertex v of T , we have degγ(v) = 2.
(ii) For any boundary vertex u of T that is not one of the master vertices A and B, we have degγ(u) = 1.
Proof. Lemma 1 implies that the r angles of size γ in the tiles are exactly accounted for if each interior
vertex accommodates two of them, each boundary vertex ﬁts one, and one of the master vertices ﬁts one
more. By Lemma 5, this is also the maximum possible for each of these vertices. Thus, the pigeon hole
principle leaves no room for any vertex to have fewer incident angles of size γ. Lemma 6 follows.

Lemma 7. Let T be a reptiling of a scalene, oblique triangle without interior half vertices.
(i) For any full vertex v of T , we have degβ(v) ≤ 2.
(ii) For any boundary vertex u of T , we have degβ(u) ≤ 1.
Proof. (i) Let v be a full vertex of T . By Lemma 6, we have degγ(v) = 2. Suppose degβ(v) > 2, and thus,
by Lemma 4, degβ(v) ≥ 4. Then the angles around v sum up to at least 4β + 2γ > 2α + 2β + 2γ = 2π,
which is too much. Hence degβ(v) ≤ 2, which establishes part (i) of the lemma.
(ii) Let u be a boundary vertex of T . By Lemma 6, we have degγ(u) = 1. Suppose degβ(u) > 1, and
thus, degβ(u) ≥ 2. Then the angles around u sum up to at least 2β + γ > α + β + γ = π, which is too
much. Hence degβ(u) ≤ 1, which establishes part (ii) of the lemma.
Lemma 8. Let T be a reptiling of a scalene, oblique triangle without interior half vertices.
(i) For any full vertex v of T , we have degβ(v) = 2.
(ii) For any boundary vertex u of T that is not one of the master vertices A, C, we have degβ(u) = 1.
Proof. The proof is completely analogous to the proof of Lemma 6.

Lemma 9. Let T be a reptiling of a scalene, oblique triangle without interior half vertices.
(i) For any full vertex v of T , we have degγ(v) = degβ(v) = degα(v) = 2.
(ii) For any boundary vertex u of T that is not one of the master vertices, we have degγ(u) = degβ(u) =
(iii) For the three master vertices of T , we have, in total, one adjacency of each type α, β and γ.
Proof. The counts of γ angles are given by Lemma 6. The counts of β angles are given by Lemma 8.
The counts of α angles follow.

degα(u) = 1.

Lemma 10. Let T be a (hypothetical) non-trivial reptiling of an isosceles, oblique triangle T without
interior half vertices. Let λ and α be the base and top angles of T .
(i) For any full vertex v of T , we have degλ(v) = 4 and degα(v) = 2.
(ii) For any boundary vertex u of T that is not one of the master vertices, we have degλ(u) = 2 and
(iii) For the three master vertices of T , we have, in total, two adjacencies of type λ and one adjacency

degα(u) = 1.

of type α.

Proof. By Theorem 5, T must be rational, that is, cos λ must be rational. Furthermore λ (cid:54)= π/3, since
then T would be equilateral and only admit trivial reptilings. Therefore, by Niven’s theorem, λ/π is
irrational.

We will now prove part (i) of the lemma; parts (ii) and (iii) are analogous. Let v be a full vertex of T .
We have degλ(v) · λ + degα(v) · α = 2π, and 4λ + 2α = 2π. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that
(degλ(v), degα(v)) (cid:54)= (4, 2). Then, solving for λ, we ﬁnd that λ/π is a rational number, which contradicts
our conclusion that λ/π is irrational. Therefore we must have (degλ(v), degα(v)) = (4, 2).

Proof of Theorem 6. Let T be an n2-reptiling of an oblique triangle T without interior half vertices. We
prove that any tile sharing either a single vertex or a whole edge with CA has to be placed exactly as in
the trivial tiling. Following this, an inductive argument on the remaining (n − 1)2 tiles that must cover
the remaining triangle ﬁnishes the proof.
Fix T as in Section 3.2, i.e. BC is ﬁxed horizontally with B to the right of C, and A above BC. More
speciﬁcally, if T is isosceles, let A be the top vertex with angle α let B and C the base vertices with angles
λ. Let T1, . . . , Th be the tiles sharing an edge with CA, top to bottom (i.e. T1 is adjacent to master
vertex A). Let A = u0, u1, . . . , uh = C be the master vertices and half vertices on CA which constitute
the corners of the tiles Ti (1 ≤ i ≤ h). Note that due to Lemma 9(ii) (if T is scalene) or Lemma 10(ii)
(if T is isosceles), every vertex ui must be adjacent to exactly one more tile for 1 ≤ i ≤ h − 1. Let
T (cid:48)1, . . . , T (cid:48)h−1 be those tiles, where ui is the unique vertex of T (cid:48)i that lies on CA, see Figure 10.
By Lemma 9(iii) (if T is scalene) or Lemma 10(iii) (if T is isosceles), T1 must be α-adjacent to A.
Let δ be the angle of T1 at vertex u1, and let  be the third angle of T1. We will now show by induction

13

u0=ABT1T2Thu1u2uh−1uh=CT01T02αδaδδδδααaααon i that, for 1 < i ≤ h, each T (cid:48)i−1 is a translate of T1 rotated 180 degrees, and each Ti is a translate
of T1. We take the second part of this claim for i = 1 as the trivial base case. Now, given that Ti−1
is a translate of T1, with its α-angle at ui−2 and a δ-angle at ui−1, we observe the following. In order
to avoid a half vertex in the interior of T along the side of Ti−1 of length a, the tile T (cid:48)i−1 has to share
its side of length a with Ti−1. Thus T (cid:48)i−1 has to be -adjacent to u1 by Lemma 9(ii) (if T is scalene) or
simply by the fact that δ =  = β = γ (if T is isosceles). Now Ti must share the edge opposite of angle δ
with the corresponding edge of T (cid:48)i−1 in order to avoid creating a half vertex, and thus, Ti is δ-adjacent
to ui. In particular, Th is δ-adjacent to uh = C, and therefore, by Lemma 9(iii), δ = γ and  = β. Thus
all tiles touching CA are placed exactly as in the trivial tiling. The theorem follows.

5 Corner-splitting reptilings

A k-splitting gentiling T of a triangle T is a gentiling of T in which k tiles meet in one of the vertices of
T , where k ≥ 2. We say a gentiling is corner-splitting if it is k-splitting for some k ≥ 2. In this section
we prove Theorem 2: only for k = 2 there exist acute triangles that admit k-splitting reptilings. In fact,
we prove a little more. In Section 5.1 we describe a construction of k-splitting gentilings and reptilings
that proves the following:

admits a 2-splitting gentiling.

(i) Any triangle with angles 0 < α < π/4, 2α and π − 3α such that cos2 α is rational,
(ii) Any triangle with angles 0 < α < π/4, 2α and π−3α such that cos α is rational, admits a 2-splitting

Theorem 7.

reptiling.

In Section 5.2 we prove that no acute triangle admits a k-splitting gentiling with k ≥ 3 (except,
possibly, for two speciﬁc triangles that might admit a 3-gentiling), and no oblique isosceles triangle
admits any corner-splitting reptiling.

5.1 A construction of 2-splitting gentilings

We now prove Theorem 7 by giving an example.

Consider a triangle T with angles α, 2α, and π−3α. The side lengths have ratios sin α : sin 2α : sin 3α,
or equivalently, 1 : 2 cos α : (4 cos2 α − 1). We can also write this as p : q : r, where p < r < 3p and
only if cos α is rational as well, we can make sure that p, q and r are natural numbers.

q =(cid:112)p2 + pr. If and only if cos2 α is rational, we can choose p and r to be natural numbers, and if and

Figure 11 shows how to assemble seven scaled copies of T (with scale factors p, q and r) and a
parallelogram with 2p(r − p) copies of T into a triangle with side lengths p2 + q2 = (2p + r)p, (2p + r)q,
and q2 +pr−p2 +r2 = (2p+r)r, that is, a copy of T scaled with factor 2p+r. Note that this construction
can be realized if and only if p and r are natural numbers. If, additionally, q is a natural number as well,
then the seven scaled triangles can all be tiled with copies of T of the same size that is used to tile the
parallelogram, and we obtain a 2-splitting reptiling with (2p + r)2 tiles. The simplest example of such a
tiling is obtained with (p, q, r) = (4, 6, 5), which results in 169 tiles. (Next best is (p, q, r) = (9, 15, 16),
resulting in 1156 tiles). This concludes the proof of Theorem 7.

Note that the construction is not limited to acute triangles: p, q and r can also be chosen such that
a reptiling of an obtuse triangle results. For example, with p = 100, q = 190, and r = 261, one gets an
obtuse triangle with angles approximately 18.2, 36.4 and 125.4 degrees and a 2-splitting 212 521-reptiling.

5.2 Acute triangles do not admit 3-splitting reptilings
Observation 5. Let T be a scalene, acute triangle with angles α, δ = kα, and φ = π− α− δ, for natural
k ≥ 2. Then there exists no natural number t such that tα = π. In particular, φ is not a multiple of α.
Proof. Since T is acute and scalene, we have 0 < |φ − δ| < α, so only δ is divisible by α and φ is not. It
follows that π = α + δ + φ is not divisible by α.

Observation 6. If T is a k-splitting gentiling of a scalene, acute triangle T with angles α < β < γ,
then there is a single master vertex X ∈ {B, C} such that the tiles of T incident to X are k tiles which
are all α-adjacent to X.

14

Figure 11: Construction of a 2-splitting gentiling for a triangle with angles α, 2α, and π − 3α, where
cos2 α is rational. The encircled numbers denote the scale factors of the tiles relative to the smallest
triangles in the tiling.

Proof. Because T is acute, we have β > γ − α, and therefore we cannot split a large (β or γ) angle into
a combination of angles that includes another large angle. Hence the master vertex with angle β or γ
must be split into k small angles.

Lemma 11. If T is a scalene, acute triangle that admits a k-splitting gentiling T with k ≥ 3, then there
is an odd number m such that α = 2π/m, where α is the smallest angle of T .

Proof. By Observation 6, there is a δ ∈ {β, γ} such that δ = kα. Let φ = π − α − δ be the remaining
angle of T .
By Lemma 1, the δ angles of the tiles are exactly accounted for if each full vertex of GT ﬁts two, each
half vertex ﬁts one, and there is one at a master vertex. Thus, if we split the master vertex with angle δ
into k angles of size α, we need a half vertex with more than one δ angle and/or a full vertex with more
than two δ angles to accommodate the δ angles of all tiles.

A half vertex with more than one δ angle cannot exist, since a half vertex with only δ and α angles
cannot exist by Observation 5, and a half vertex with at least two δ angles and a φ angle cannot exist
due to 2δ + φ > α + δ + φ = π.

Now suppose v is a full vertex with at least three δ angles. We cannot have degφ(v) ≥ 2, since
3δ + 2φ = 2δ + 2φ + kα > 2π. We cannot have degφ(v) = 1 either, since this would imply that
degδ(v)δ + φ = 2π (mod α) and therefore π = 2π − (α + δ + φ) = (degδ(v) − 1)δ − α = 0 (mod α),
contradicting Observation 5. Therefore we must have degφ(v) = 0, that is, v must have only δ and α
angles, and hence 2π must be divisible by α. Because π is not divisible by α, the divisor m in α = 2π/m
must be odd.

Theorem 8. No acute triangle T admits a k-splitting gentiling for k ≥ 4. If T is an acute triangle and
admits a 3-splitting gentiling, then the angles of T are either ( 2

13 π, 5

13 π, 6

13 π) or ( 2

15 π, 6

15 π).

Proof. Assume T is an acute triangle that admits a k-splitting gentiling T with k ≥ 3. Let α ≤ β ≤ γ be
the angles of T . Note that α < β, otherwise we would have (α, β, γ) = (α, α, kα) and γ = kπ/(k+2) > π/2
and T would not be acute.

By Lemma 1 we have 2r = 4f + 2h + 2. This means that the large (β and γ) angles of the tiles in a
tiling T of T are exactly accounted for if each full vertex of GT ﬁts four, each half vertex ﬁts two, and
there are two at the master vertices. Thus, if we replace a large angle at a master vertex by k small (α)

more than two large angles to accommodate the large angles of all tiles.

Observe γ ≥ β = π − γ − α > π/2 − α > (1 − 1/k)π/2, due to the fact that T is acute. Hence, for
3 π, and no half vertex can have more than two large angles. It follows that

k ≥ 3, we have γ ≥ β > 1
there must be a full vertex v with at least ﬁve large angles, and therefore, 5β ≤ 2π.
If T is isosceles, that is, γ = β = kα, then 5β ≤ 2π can be rewritten as 5kπ/(2k + 1) ≤ 2π, which
solves to k ≤ 2.
If T is not isosceles, we get from Lemma 11 that the angles of T are α = 2π/m, δ = 2kπ/m, and
φ = π − α − δ, for some odd integer m. Since T is acute and scalene, we have 0 < |φ − δ| < α. With
φ − δ = π − α − 2δ = (m − 2 − 4k) π
m we now get 0 < |m − 2 − 4k| < 2 for some odd integer
m, hence |m − 2 − 4k| = 1 and |φ − δ| = π/m = α/2. Thus, we either have:
• m = 2 + 2k + (2k − 1) = 4k + 1, where β = φ = (2k − 1)π/(4k + 1) or
• m = 2 + 2k + (2k + 1) = 4k + 3, where β = δ = 2kπ/(4k + 3).

m and α = 2 π

In both cases, solving 5β ≤ 2π yields k ≤ 3, and we ﬁnd that m is either 13 or 15, resulting in the two
possible sets of angles as stated in the lemma.

Indeed, 3-splitting gentilings with the aforementioned angles might be realizable: at least they cannot
be ruled out based on pigeon-hole arguments on the angles alone. With angles ( 2
13 π), one can
account for the α, β and γ angles of all tiles by including a full vertex with (degα, degβ, degγ) = (1, 0, 4)
and a full vertex with (degα, degβ, degγ) = (0, 4, 1). With angles ( 2
15 π), one can account for
the α, β and γ angles of all tiles by including a full vertex with (degα, degβ, degγ) = (1, 0, 4) and a full
vertex with (degα, degβ, degγ) = (0, 5, 0).
Theorem 9. No acute triangle T admits a k-splitting reptiling T for k ≥ 3.
Proof. In this proof, we will use the trigonometric identities sin(3ω) = 3 sin(ω) − 4 sin3(ω); sin2(ω) =

Theorem 10. No oblique isosceles triangle T admits a k-splitting reptiling T for k ≥ 2.
Proof. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that T is an oblique isosceles triangle admitting a k-
splitting reptiling T for k ≥ 2. Let λ and τ be the base and top angle of T , respectively. If a k-splitting
reptiling exists, we must have either τ = kλ or λ = kτ . In the ﬁrst case, we get λ = π/(k + 2), and
in particular 0 < λ ≤ π/4 < π/3.
In the second case, we get λ = kπ/(2k + 1), and in particular
π/3 < 2π/5 ≤ λ < π/2. In both cases, by Niven’s theorem, we have cos(λ) /∈ Q, and therefore, by
Theorem 5, T admits only trivial reptilings and no k-splitting reptilings.

6 No face-continuous space-ﬁlling curves for acute triangles

In this section we prove Theorem 3: no face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve can be constructed on the
basis of reptilings of an acute triangle.

Consider a reptiling T of an acute triangle T . If multiple tiles of T meet at a master vertex v of T ,
we say v is a fan in T . If there is only a single tile touching a master vertex v and the interior edge of
that tile (the edge opposite to v) is a union of edges of multiple adjacent tiles, then we say v is a cap
in T . We deﬁne the dual of T as the graph that has a node for each tile of T , and contains an edge
between two nodes if the corresponding tiles of T touch each other in more than a single point.
Lemma 12. If there is a face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve based on a reptiling of T , then T must admit
a reptiling T of which the dual contains a Hamiltonian path.
Proof. Consider any tiling T of T that results from tiling T with reptilings recursively, to a suﬃcient
recursion depth such that no tile touches more than one master vertex. A space-ﬁlling curve based on
this tiling must visit the tiles one by one. If there is any pair of consecutive tiles along the curve that do
not touch each other in more than a single point, then there would be a section of the space-ﬁlling curve
(namely the section traversing exactly this pair of tiles) with a disconnected interior. Hence the order in
which the space-ﬁlling curve visits the tiles must be such that the corresponding sequence of vertices in
the dual describes a Hamiltonian path.

Lemma 13. If there is a face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve based on a reptiling of T , then T must admit
a tiling T in which at least one master vertex is a cap or a fan.
Proof. Consider any tiling T of T that results from tiling T with reptilings recursively, to a suﬃcient
recursion depth such that no tile touches more than one master vertex. By Lemma 12, the dual of T
must contain a Hamiltonian path. To be able to construct such a path, we have to be able to get into and
out of at least one of the master vertices. More precisely, let v be the vertex of T that is visited second
by the space-ﬁlling curve. The visit to v must be part of a traversal of a tile S whose corresponding
vertex S(cid:48) in the dual is neither ﬁrst nor last on the Hamiltonian path. Hence S(cid:48) must have degree at
least two, which is the case exactly if S is one of the tiles that makes v a fan, or if it is the single tile
that makes v a cap.

Lemma 14. In a scalene acute triangle, at most one corner is a fan or a cap of any reptiling.

Proof. Since in any triangle, the length diﬀerence between the longest two edges is strictly less than the
length of the shortest edge, at most one edge of a tile can be exactly as long as two or more edges of
other tiles. Therefore, at most one master vertex can be a cap. Similarly, since the largest two angles of
any acute triangle diﬀer by strictly less than the smallest angle, α, at most one master vertex can be a
fan. It remains to show that it cannot be that in one reptiling, one master vertex is a fan, and in the
same or another reptiling, another master vertex is a cap.

By Theorem 9, if a fan exists, its angle must be 2α, where π/6 < α < π/4 and the third master vertex
has angle π− 3α. Now it follows immediately from π/6 < α < π/4, and thus, 1 > sin(α), sin(2α), sin(π−
3α) > 1/2, that each edge of a tile is more than half as long as any other edge, and therefore no master
vertex can be a cap.

Let a two-level reptiling of a triangle T be an r2-reptiling T2 that is obtained by ﬁrst r-reptiling
a master triangle T with intermediate tiles, and then r-reptiling each intermediate tile with an equal
number of atomic tiles. The reptilings within the intermediate tiles may diﬀer from one intermediate
tile to another, but we require that each of them has the same number of tiles, so all atomic tiles have
the same size. Let a conforming Hamiltonian path of the dual of T2 be an ordering of the atomic tiles
such that each atomic tile (except the ﬁrst) touches the previous tile in more than a single point, and
the atomic tiles within any intermediate tile are consecutive in the order.

Lemma 15. No acute triangle admits an arbitrarily ﬁne two-level reptiling whose dual admits a con-
forming Hamiltonian path.

17

Figure 12: Illustration of the proof of Lemma 15 for a scalene triangle (left) and an isosceles triangle
(right).

Proof. Let α ≤ β ≤ γ be the angles of an acute triangle T . Let the r-reptilings deﬁning a two-level
reptiling T2 of T be obtained by applying reptilings recursively to a suﬃciently deep level of recursion,
such that r > (2 sin γ/ sin α)2. This ensures that no intermediate tile touches more than one master
vertex, and the longest edge of any tile of T2 is less than half as long as the shortest edge of any
intermediate tile.

We distinguish two cases: isosceles triangles, and scalene triangles.
We ﬁrst discuss scalene triangles. For the sake of contradiction, suppose a conforming Hamiltonian
path exists. The construction of our contradiction is illustrated in Figure 12 (left). By Lemma 14, at
most one vertex of a scalene acute triangle is a potential fan or cap. We denote the angle at this vertex
by δ, the smallest angle by α, and the remaining angle by φ. Thus, in the dual of any (single-level)
reptiling, a Hamiltonian path, if one exists, has to start with the tile in the corner with angle α and
end with the tile in the corner with angle φ, or vice versa. Now consider the intermediate tile A in the
corner with angle α. This tile shares its interior edge with a single other intermediate tile A(cid:48), which can
only be placed in one way, namely with its φ angle adjacent to the δ angle of A and with its δ angle
adjacent to the φ angle of A (otherwise the largest angle of A(cid:48) would meet the largest angle of A, and
this would leave a gap with an angle smaller than α between A(cid:48) and the boundary of the master triangle,
so the tiling could not be completed). Now the conforming Hamiltonian path through the tiling would
have to end its traversal of A with the atomic tile in the corner v of size φ, and then continue into A(cid:48).
However, the only possible starting points for a Hamiltonian path through A(cid:48) are the tiles in its α- and
φ-corners, but these tiles lie at the opposite ends of the edges of A(cid:48) that meet in v, and by our choice of
r, these tiles are too small to be able to touch the tile in the φ-corner of A. It follows that a conforming
Hamiltonian path is not possible.

For the case of an isosceles triangle, let λ and τ be the base and top angle of the triangle, respectively.
By Theorem 10, the triangle does not admit any fans. Caps at the top are not possible either, since the
base of an isosceles triangle cannot be at least twice as long as a leg. Caps at the base corners, however,
are possible, provided the length of a leg is k times the length of the base for some natural number k ≥ 2.
This implies that the top angle is smaller than the base angle, and henceforth we will speak of small
angles/corners (of which each tile has one) and large angles/corners (of which each tile has two).

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a conforming Hamiltonian path in a two-level
reptiling of an isosceles triangle. The construction of our contradiction is illustrated in Figure 12 (right).
Since there are no fans, for each corner there is a unique intermediate tile touching that corner. Let M
be an intermediate tile touching a corner that is neither ﬁrst nor last on the Hamiltonian path—therefore
that corner has to be a cap, and it is one of the larger corners. Without loss of generality, assume M is
oriented such that its short edge (base) is horizontal, its small vertex (top) lies above it, and the master
vertex is the left base corner of M . Let U2, U4, U6, . . . , U2k be the adjacent intermediate tiles whose base
(short) edges cover the right edge of M , in order from bottom to top (where 1/k = 2 cos λ), and let
U1, U3, U5, . . . , U2k+1 be the intermediate tiles that have a single corner on the right edge of M , in order
from bottom to top. Note that given the placement of M , the placement of U1, . . . , U2k is ﬁxed—only

Table 1: Our current state of knowledge about the existence of k-splitting gentilings of acute triangles
with angles α, kα and π − (k + 1)α. The lower and upper bounds on α in the table only serve to ensure
that the triangle is indeed acute.

U2k+1 could be a translate of M or a translate of U2k−1.

Observe that any Hamiltonian path in any reptiling of any intermediate tile must either start or end
with the tile in the small vertex. Without loss of generality, assume the traversal of M starts at the top
(otherwise we could complete the argument based on the reverse of the space-ﬁlling curve). That means
that the intermediate tile visited immediately before M must be U2k. Therefore, immediately after M ,
we must visit one of the tiles Ui, for some i ∈ {2, 4, 6, ..., 2k − 2}. Since we enter Ui on the left side, that
is, not at its small corner, we must end the traversal at its small corner, on the right. From there, the
traversal can continue in either Ui−1 or Ui+1. Since we enter Ui−1 or Ui+1 at a large angle, the traversal
must end at the small angle, on the left, touching M . From there we have no choice but to continue in
Ui−2 or Ui+2, respectively. This inevitably leads to getting stuck in the left corner of either U2k−1 (being
unable to continue in U2k because it was already visited) or U1 (being unable to continue because at its
left corner, it is adjacent only to U2, which is where we came from).

Theorem 3 now follows as a direct corollary of Lemmas 12 and 15: it is not possible to construct a

face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve based on reptilings of an acute triangle.

7 Topics for further research

Our original aim was to prove the existence or non-existence of face-continuous space-ﬁlling curves based
on gentilings of acute triangles. While we were working on this problem, the questions for non-trivial
reptilings and corner-splitting gentilings emerged as puzzles of independent entertainment value, and we
have not completely solved them.

The ﬁrst open question that remains is the following:

Problem 1. How can we fully classify all triangles that admit a non-trivial reptiling?

Related facts. We know that all right triangles admit non-trivial reptilings and we have established that
all rational triangles admit non-trivial reptilings (Theorem 4). Theorem 5 states that irrational acute
triangles and irrational oblique isosceles triangles do not admit non-trivial reptilings. This leaves the
irrational scalene obtuse triangles undecided.

More precisely, the problem is still open for the irrational triangles with angles π/m, kπ/m and

(m − k − 1)π/m, for k, m ∈ N, where 2 ≤ k < m/2 − 1 and there are non-zero natural numbers λ, µ, ν

such that λ sin(π/m) = µ sin(kπ/m) + ν sin((k + 1)π/m). Otherwise class (i) in the non-existence proof
for non-trivial reptilings in Section 3.2 would still apply, or Observation 2 or Observation 3 applies and
the analysis of class (ii) would still go through. In fact, an easy pigeon-hole argument based on Lemma 1,
similar to the arguments used in Section 5.2, shows that Observation 4 can also be established for obtuse
triangles with an angle larger than 2π/3, since then, no more than two such angles can meet in a point;
therefore we may restrict k further by m/3 − 1 ≤ k < m/2 − 1.
Is this class of irrational triangles actually non-empty, and if so, does any such triangle admit a
non-trivial reptiling? (If so, Theorem 6 tells us that the tiling must include interior half vertices.) Or
can we prove that none of these triangles admits a non-trivial reptiling, and hence, the right triangles
and the rational triangles are the only triangles admitting non-trivial reptilings?

19

Table 1 summarizes our current state of knowledge about the existence of k-splitting gentilings of
acute triangles. We are left with the following open problems with regard to the existence of k-splitting
reptilings of oblique triangles:

Problem 2. Is there an oblique triangle that admits a 2-splitting r-reptiling with r < 169?

2-splitting reptiling?

Problem 3. Is there an oblique triangle with angles α, 2α and π − 3α with cos α /∈ Q, that admits a
If we drop the requirements cos α /∈ Q and r < 169, a construction is given in Section 5.1.

Related facts.
If we drop the requirement that the triangle is not a right triangle, then all right triangles, regardless of
cos α, are solutions allowing a 2-splitting 4-reptiling.

For gentilings, we can easily extend our negative results to obtuse triangles with an angle larger than

2π/3:
Theorem 11. No triangle T with an angle greater than 2π/3 admits a k-splitting gentiling for k ≥ 3.
Proof. Let the angles of T be α ≤ β < γ, where γ > 2π/3.
By Lemma 1 we have 2r = 4f + 2h + 2. This means that the γ angles of the tiles in a tiling T of T
are exactly accounted for if each full vertex of GT ﬁts two, each half vertex ﬁts one, and there is one at
a master vertex. Since 3γ > 2π and 2γ > π, this is also the most that will ﬁt at each of these vertices.
Hence, the full vertices, half vertices, and master vertices must ﬁt exactly two γ angles per vertex, one
γ angle per vertex, and one γ angle in total, respectively. In particular, the master vertex with the γ
angle cannot be split, so we must have β = kα.

Now, by Lemma 1, the β angles of the tiles in a tiling are exactly accounted for if each full vertex of GT
ﬁts two, each half vertex ﬁts one, and there is one at a master vertex. Since 2γ + 3β = 2γ + 2β + kα > 2π
and γ + 2β = γ + β + kα > π, this is also the most that will ﬁt at each of these vertices. Hence, the β
angle cannot be split either. It follows that a k-splitting gentiling is not possible.

This leaves several open problems with regard to the existence of k-splitting gentilings of triangles,

including:

Problem 4. Is there an oblique triangle with angles α, 2α and π − 3α with cos2 α /∈ Q that admits a

2-splitting gentiling?

Problem 6. What is the largest k for which there exists a k-splitting gentiling?
Related facts. The isosceles triangle with α = 1
6 π admits a 4-splitting 5-gentiling (Figure 13(d)). From
Theorems 8 and 11 we get that the triangle that maximizes k must be non-acute with largest angle at
most 2π/3.

Finally consider our original goal. The proof of Section 6 that no face-continuous space-ﬁlling curves
exist on the basis of reptilings of an acute triangle, crucially exploits the fact that the triangle is acute
and that tiles have the same size and that this makes it impossible to construct useful caps. The following
questions are still completely open:

Problem 7. Is there a face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve based on a reptiling of an obtuse triangle?

Note that with respect to the original motivation, obtuse triangles are probably not interesting,
as they would not be better-shaped than the isosceles right triangles underlying the Sierpi´nski curve.
Therefore, unless an application appears which would really require oblique mesh elements, the above
problem may mostly be interesting for entertainment.

Problem 8. Is there a face-continuous space-ﬁlling curve based on a gentiling of an acute triangle?

Related facts. Note that face-continuous space-ﬁlling curves can be constructed based on:

• a 2-splitting 2-reptiling of the isosceles right triangle (the Sierpi´nski curve [12], Figure 13(a));
• a 2-splitting 3-reptiling of the right triangle with angle 1
• a 2-splitting 2-gentiling of any right triangle (P´olya curves [12], Figure 13(c));
• a 4-splitting 5-gentiling of the isosceles obtuse triangle with base angle 1
