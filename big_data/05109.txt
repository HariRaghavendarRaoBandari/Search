We investigate a model of hard-core bosons with correlated hopping on the honeycomb lattice in
an external magnetic ﬁeld by means of a coupled-wire approach. It has been numerically shown
that this model exhibits at half ﬁlling the bosonic integer quantum Hall (BIQH) state, which is a
symmetry-protected topological phase protected by the U (1) particle conservation [Y.-C. He et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 116803 (2015)]. By combining the bosonization approach and a coupled-
wire construction, we analytically conﬁrm this ﬁnding and show that it even holds in the strongly
anisotropic (quasi-one-dimensional) limit. We discuss the stability of the BIQH phase against tun-
neling that break the separate particle conservations on diﬀerent sublattices down to a global particle
conservation. We further argue that a phase transition between two diﬀerent BIQH phases is in a
deconﬁned quantum critical point described by two copies of the (2 + 1)-dimensional O(4) nonlinear
sigma model with the topological θ term at θ = π. Finally we predict a possible fractional quantum
Hall state, the Halperin (221) state, at 1/6 ﬁlling.

INTRODUCTION

In the last couple of decades, our understanding of
gapped quantum phases of condensed matter has sig-
niﬁcantly advanced, especially with respect to topolog-
ical phases that cannot be satisfactorily characterized
by spontaneous symmetry breaking. These include two
diﬀerent classes of phases [1]: (i) topologically ordered
phases, e.g., fractional quantum Hall phases, and (ii)
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, e.g., the
Haldane phase in spin chains and topological band insu-
lators. The former class is characterized by long-range-
quantum-entangled ground states that can support “any-
onic” excitations with nontrivial braiding statistics (in
two spatial dimensions) and associated topological de-
generacy depending on the topology of the systems. Such
phases remain well-deﬁned as phases distinct from the
trivial ones even in the absence of any symmetry. SPT
phases, on the other hand, have short-range-quantum-
entangled ground states that remain well-deﬁned only
in the presence of certain symmetries. For example,
the Haldane phase is protected by the dihedral group
of π rotations about two orthogonal spin axes, time-
reversal symmetry, or bond-centered inversion symme-
try [2]. While the SPT phases do not host any nontrivial
bulk excitations, they typically possess nontrivial surface
physics. A variety of mathematical frameworks have been
proposed to characterize and classify both the topologi-
cally ordered and SPT phases [1–12]. While free-fermion
systems have by now been completely classiﬁed, the un-
derstanding of SPT phases in interacting fermionic and
bosonic systems is an ongoing central topic of research.

A particularly interesting question in this regard is
about how to stabilize exotic topological phases in sys-
tems of interacting bosons. Note that unlike fermions,
which can host topological phases even in noninteract-
ing systems [13–15], noninteracting bosons usually con-

dense and hence the interaction is essential to realize
topological phases of bosons. This raises important ques-
tions regarding the nature of interactions in microscopic
lattice models that can lead to such bosonic topologi-
cal phases. However, the progress in controllably un-
derstanding these phases starting from lattice models
is often hindered by the overarching problem of limita-
tions in the present analytical approaches to deal with
strongly interacting many-body systems, although the
physics of strongly interacting bosonic models can in
principle be very rich. Under these circumstances, nu-
merical approaches are of great help in understanding
the fate of such systems. On the analytical side, a suc-
cessful approach has been to construct nontrivial exactly
solvable models, which then serve as “parent Hamiltoni-
ans” to understand such correlated phases [3, 16–27]. An
alternative way is the so-called projective construction
[28–37]. In this approach, the physical particles (micro-
scopic degrees of freedom) of a model are broken up into
a product of “partons”, which are bosons or fermions.
Then the ground state is obtained by projecting a mean-
ﬁeld ground state of those partons back onto the original
Hilbert space.

A complimentary approach, which can give a more con-
trolled way to access the physics of microscopic models
than parton methods and is more general than parent
Hamiltonian methods, is the coupled-wire construction
[4, 38–52]. The general idea of this approach is as follows:
We start from an array of wires (i.e., one-dimensional sys-
tems), each of which can be described by using power-
ful techniques such as bosonization to yield an eﬀective
low-energy description. The hoppings and interactions
between wires are then incorporated to couple the low-
energy modes of neighboring wires, yielding a description
for the two-dimensional (2D) system. This prescription
has been successfully implemented for integer and frac-
tional quantum Hall states for which it was originally
proposed [38–40]. In that context, at the single wire level

one obtains Luttinger liquids in a magnetic ﬁeld with left-
and right-moving gapless modes.
Inter-wire couplings
mix these modes from diﬀerent wires and open a gap suc-
cessively from wire to wire, leading to a bulk gap and un-
paired gapless modes—chiral edge states of the quantum
Hall state—at the end wires. The above idea has recently
been generalized to describe several other 2D topological
phases [4, 41–49] including the Kalmeyer-Laughlin chi-
ral spin liquid on lattice spin systems [49, 53], as well
as several three-dimensional topological phases [50–52].
An obvious limitation of this approach is that quantita-
tive prediction is restricted to highly anisotropic systems,
that is weakly coupled wires. Nevertheless, this approach
enables us to strictly keep track of the eﬀects of inter-
actions with the help of renormalization group and to
study qualitative properties of the ground state beyond
the perturbative regime unless some phase transition oc-
curs by increasing the couplings between the wires. For
example, the stability of a topologically ordered phase
that supports the non-Abelian Fibonacci anyon, which
is originally proposed by the coupled-wire construction
in the quasi-one-dimensional limit [41], is justiﬁed even
in isotropic 2D lattice systems by numerical simulations
[54].

In this paper, utilizing bosonization techniques and
the coupled-wire construction, we study two-component
bosonic quantum Hall states realized on a lattice model.
We focus on a model of hard-core bosons interacting via
correlated hoppings under background gauge ﬁelds on
the honeycomb lattice, which was recently proposed in
Ref. [55] and shown to exhibit a bosonic integer quantum
Hall (BIQH) state. The BIQH state is a bosonic SPT
phase protected by a U (1) symmetry related to the con-
servation of the total boson number [4, 56–58]. Although
this state has been found in two-component Bose gases
[59–61], its lattice realizations have only been proposed
and numerically studied quite recently [55, 62]. Here, we
show that a spatially anisotropic limit of the model pro-
posed in Ref. [55] also exhibits the BIQH phase at half
ﬁlling, which is possibly adiabatically connected to the
one found by numerics [55]. Our calculations provide use-
ful insights to the connection between the physics of the
correlated hoppings in the model and the mutual ﬂux at-
tachment picture for the bosons as suggested in Ref. [58]
for realizing the BIQH state; due to this ﬂux attachment,
the condensation of the resulting composite bosons turns
out to be not a superﬂuid but the BIQH phase with the
Hall conductance σxy = ±2. We then discuss the eﬀect of
tunnelings that break the U (1)×U (1) symmetry of charge
conservation on two sublattices down to a simple U (1)
symmetry related to total charge conservation. We also
ﬁnd indications that a possible continuous phase transi-
tion between diﬀerent BIQH phases is described by two
copies of the (2 + 1)-dimensional O(4) nonlinear sigma
model with the θ term at θ = π. Further we extend our
calculations to the case of 1/6 ﬁlling for which we propose
that the system stabilizes a bosonic fractional quantum
Hall state—the so-called Halperin (221) state [63].

lattice. The A and B sublattices are denoted by the ﬁlled and
open circles, respectively. The red (blue) solid lines represent
the correlated hoppings in the sublattice A (B). On the A
sublattice, the upper triangles are pierced by the ﬂux α while
the lower ones by π − α. On the B sublattice, the lower
triangles are pierced by the ﬂux β while the upper ones by
π − β.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we
introduce the model and its anisotropic deformation. We
employ the standard bosonization procedure in Sec. III
and derive the low-energy eﬀective theory of the model.
In Sec. IV, utilizing the idea of coupled-wire construc-
tion, we ﬁnd that the ground state corresponds to the
BIQH phase for half ﬁlling and the Halperin (221) state
for 1/6 ﬁlling. The eﬀect of inter-sublattice tunnelings
and a possible eﬀective description of the transition be-
tween the BIQH phases are also discussed.
In Sec. V
we conclude with a short summary and discussion. Two
appendices are devoted to various technical details.

II. MODEL

We start by describing the system of hard-core bosons
on the honeycomb lattice (or a bilayer triangular lattice)
in the presence of a background magnetic ﬂux, which has
been introduced in Ref. [55]. The Hamiltonian is given
by

where ai is the bosonic annihilation operator on site i
in the sublattice A, bi is that in the sublattice B, na
i =

†
i ai, and nb
i bi. These bosonic operators satisfy the
a
hard-core constraint (ai)2 = (bi)2 = 0. The correlated
hoppings involve three sites denoted by (cid:104)i, j; k(cid:105) as shown
in Fig. 1, where i and j are next-nearest-neighboring sites

i = b

belonging to the same sublattice while k represents the
site between i and j that belongs to the other sublattice.
The ﬂuxes A and B are assigned as follows:

(cid:88)
(cid:88)
(cid:88)
(cid:88)

i,j∈(cid:52)(i,j∈A)

i,j∈(cid:53)(i,j∈A)

k,l∈(cid:52)(k,l∈B)

k,l∈(cid:53)(k,l∈B)

Aij = α,

Aij = π − α,

Bkl = π − β,

Bkl = β,

(2)

where all the pairs of site indices run in the clockwise
around each triangle as shown in Fig. 1. Also Aij = −Aji
and Bkl = −Blk. Thus, each hexagon is pierced by a uni-
form ﬂux π and each triangle on the sublattice is further
threaded by a staggered ﬂux: α for the up triangles while
π − α for the down ones that are associated with the A
sublattice, and β for the down triangles while π − β for
the up ones associated with the B sublattice. The hop-
ping between sites i and j on the A sublattice changes
its sign, depending on whether the intermediate site k
on the B sublattice is occupied on not, and similarly for
the hopping on the B sublattice. This extra sign can
be interpreted as an additional mutual ﬂux seen by one
species of bosons due to the other species. This resem-
bles a mutual ﬂux attachment proposed by Senthil and
Levin [58] to realize a BIQH phase; one species of boson
binds one ﬂux quantum of the other species by a mu-
tual Chern-Simons term. As we will see below through
the coupled-wire construction, our model indeed favors
those “mutual composite bosons” as fundmental degrees
of freedom rather than the standard bosons. These nat-
urally raise the BIQH and Halperin (221) states as can-
didates of ground state for given ﬁllings.

Apart from the various lattice symmetries, in the above
model, the two ﬂavors of bosons associated with the two
sublattices are independently conserved, i.e. there is a
U (1)a × U (1)b symmetry where a and b are the two bo-
son ﬂavors introduced earlier. Alternatively we may state
that the above symmetry can be cast as separate conser-
vation of the total number of bosons (both a and b) and
the diﬀerence between the two sublattices. The conser-
vation of the total boson charge (we use number and
charge interchangeably) is represented by U (1)c, while
the conservation of their diﬀerence, which we denote as
pseudospin, by U (1)s. In terms of charge and pseudospin,
the symmetry of the model is thus U (1)c × U (1)s.

This model [Eq. (1)] was introduced in Ref. [55] and
studied numerically by three of the present authors.
The hopping between nearest-neighboring sites, which
is omitted from Eq. (1), destroys the conservation of
the pseudospin U (1)s symmetry such that the remaining
symmetry is only U (1)c (apart from the lattice symme-
tries). The numerical results conﬁrmed that the BIQH
phase is robust to such perturbations, as the SPT phase

can be protected by the U (1)c symmetry alone. We
will introduce these terms and discuss their eﬀect in
Sec. IV B.

A. Mapping to the array of chains

In order to treat the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) within the
coupled-wire approach, we need to write it as a quasi-
one-dimensional system. To this end, it is convenient to
rewrite the Hamiltonian in the following form,

H = H0 + H1,

H0 = t

where the “chain” index j and “site” index (cid:96) are assgined
as in Fig. 2. This mapping to the array of chains and the
“Jordan-Wigner-like” transformation deﬁned below are
somewhat similar to those introduced to solve the Kitaev-
honeycomb model [18, 64]. Here we put the model on a
cylinder with the length N and the circumference L, such
that the respective sites in each chain (cid:96) = 1 and (cid:96) = L+1
are identiﬁed. Here, we have explicitly introduced the
hopping amplitudes t and t(cid:48). At t = t(cid:48) = 1, the model is
spatially isotropic and we recover Eq. (1). Throughout
this paper, we assume that t(cid:48) is perturbatively smaller
than the chain hopping t.

Jordon-Wigner string, we end up with the same conclu-
sion as long as one carefully keeps track of the particle
statistics in the bosonization procedure.

Using the transformation (6), the chain Hamiltonian is

(cid:105)

simply written as

where we have parametrized the gauge ﬁelds to be ho-
mogeneous along the chain:

A(j,(cid:96))
(j,(cid:96)+1) ≡ A(cid:107), B(j,(cid:96))

(j,(cid:96)+1) ≡ B(cid:107).

(10)

This choice allows us to take a simple continuum limit
along the chains as we perform below. In Eq. (9), the
density operators in the correlated hoppings are canceled
with the string operators due to the relation,

j,(cid:96) − 1 = −eiπns
j,(cid:96).

Expressing the original bosonic operators in terms of ˜a

B. Jordan-Wigner-like transformation

Although the chain Hamiltonian (4) is not in the
quadratic form, it can be transformed into a simple hop-
ping Hamiltonian by the following Jordan-Wigner-like
transformation. To implement the transformation, we
introduce new operators ˜aj,(cid:96) and ˜bj,(cid:96) on the A and B
sublattice respectively such that

˜aj,(cid:96) = K b
˜bj,(cid:96) = K a

j,(cid:96)aj,(cid:96),
j,(cid:96)bj,(cid:96),

where K s

j,(cid:96), s = a, b are the string operators deﬁned by

The paths of the string operators are depicted in Fig. 2.
As shown in the ﬁgure, the string attached to the opera-
tor aj,(cid:96) comes from the upper end of the cylinder, sweeps
sites on the sublattice B with winding the cylinder, and
ends up at the site (j, (cid:96)). On the other hand, the string
attached to bj,(cid:96) comes from the lower end and sweeps
all the sites on the sublattice A before reaching the site
(j, (cid:96)). Thus, the two strings wind the cylinder in oppo-
site directions with respect to each other when we look
down from either end of the cylinder. At this stage we
introduce a more symmetric form of the string operators
[Eq. (7)] for later convenience (see also Ref. [65]), as

j,(cid:96) = cos

It is easy to check that the two formulas (7) and (8) are
equivalent since ns

j,(cid:96) only takes integer values 0 or 1.

j,(cid:96) involves na

The new operators ˜a and ˜b still obey the bosonic statis-
tics by the above choice of the strings. If the sting oper-
ator K a
j(cid:48),(cid:96)(cid:48), it produces a minus sign when
K a
j,(cid:96) goes over the operator aj(cid:48),(cid:96)(cid:48). Similarly, the string
operator K b
j,(cid:96) produces a minus sign when it involves
nb
j(cid:48),(cid:96)(cid:48) and goes over bj(cid:48),(cid:96)(cid:48). However, when ˜aj,(cid:96) goes over
˜bj(cid:48),(cid:96)(cid:48), this process always produces a minus sign zero or
two times; thus they obey the bosonic statistics. At this
point it is interesting to note that diﬀerent choices of the
string operators give the particle operators obeying mu-
tual or genuine fermionic statistics; the latter is achieved
by the standard 2D Jordan-Winer transformation [66].
However, we also note that no matter how we choose the

In the above expression, we have used ˜ns
j,(cid:96) and
the density operators have been absorbed into the string
operators by using Eq. (11). A price to pay of the
Jordan-Wigner-like transformation is that we need to
treat the nonlocal interchain interactions involving the
strings. However, those interactions can be converted to
local interactions after the bosonization procedure, as we
will see in the next section.

We note that one can proceed to the bosonization anal-
ysis without incorporating the density operators into the

strings. This will lead to a slightly diﬀerent continuum
expression for the interaction Hamiltonian. However the
resulting physics is not changed whichever we choose, as
shown in Appendix A. In the following, we consider the
interaction Hamiltonian of the form (12).

Following the standard bosonization techniques [65,
67], we here derive the eﬀective low-energy theory for
the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (3). We take the contin-
uum limit with respect to the site index (cid:96), while the chain
index j is kept discrete. Thus we introduce a continuous
variable x = (cid:96)a0 with a0 begin the lattice spacing on
the sublattices. Since the chain Hamiltonian (9) is noth-
ing but the hopping Hamiltonian of hard-core bosons, or
equivalently the spin-1/2 XX chain, it can be described
by an array of two-component Luttinger liquids,

where v = 2ta0 sin(π ¯ρa0) and ¯ρ is the mean density of the

modulation of boson density among chains, leading to the
same mean density ¯ρ on both the A and B sublattices.

with integers q > 1, but those operators do not enter the
following analysis.

We then consider the bosonized expressions of the
string operators (14). For the arguments of the cosine
terms of the string operators, by replacing the sum over

A similar anticommuting property also holds between
j,(cid:96) and ˜bj(cid:48),(cid:96) for j(cid:48) ≥ j. In combination with the commu-
˜K b
tation relation (16), this relation ensures that the original
bosonic operators a and b commute with each other.

To be precise, for the bosonization formulas of the
string operators (21), one should take a sum over any
vertex operator einθs
j with odd n, as the lattice string
operators (7) do not change under the replacement of iπ

by inπ with odd n. However, as we will see in Sec. IV,
interactions involving the vertex operators with large n
are generally irrelevant in low energy and at a commen-
surate ﬁlling not too far from half ﬁlling. In the following
analysis, such higher harmonics do not have any crucial
role. Therefore, we only keep einθs
j with the smallest odd
integers n = ±1 as in Eq. (21).

In the following analysis, we assign the phases of the

correlated hoppings as

A(cid:107) = π − α,
B(cid:107) = β,

(25)

for the hoppings inside the chains [for the deﬁnitions of
A(cid:107) and B(cid:107), see Eq. (10)], and

A(j,(cid:96))
(j+1,(cid:96)−1) = A(j,(cid:96))
B(j,(cid:96))
(j+1,(cid:96)−1) = B(j,(cid:96))

(j+1,(cid:96)) = π(cid:96),

(j+1,(cid:96)) = π(cid:96),

(26)

for the hoppings between neighboring chains. This as-
signment of the phases is shown in Fig. 3. The continuum
limit is then obtained by

a0A(j,(cid:96))
a0B(j,(cid:96))

(j+1,(cid:96)−1) = a0A(j,(cid:96))
(j+1,(cid:96)−1) = a0B(j,(cid:96))

(j+1,(cid:96)) → πx,
(j+1,(cid:96)) → πx.

IV. QUANTUM HALL PHASES

We are now ready to analyze Hamiltonian (3) ex-
pressed in terms of the bosonic ﬁelds. The detail can
be found in Appendix A. On extracting the vertex oper-
ators that govern the low-energy physics, we ﬁnd that,
as expected, the background gauge ﬂuxes play an im-
portant role. Because of the uniform ﬂux π for each
hexagonal plaquette (as shown in Fig. 1), the exponen-
tial factor eiπx/a0 appears in the interaction Hamiltonian
(12); terms involving this factor rapidly oscillate in x and
will vanish after the spatial integration. In order to have
nonvanishing terms in Eq. (12), this factor must be can-
celed by another exponential factor ei2nπ ¯ρx with n ∈ Z.
Thus we require certain commensurate conditions on the
mean density ¯ρ under which quantum Hall states can
arise. Furthermore, the staggered ﬂux α or β for each
triangle, with the help of the frustrated structure of the
triangular plaquettes in our model, selects the chirality
of those quantum Hall states.

We now state the central results of this work. In the
following, we consider the two cases with the ﬁlling fac-
tors ¯ρa0 = 1/2 and 1/6. At ¯ρa0 = 1/2, we obtain the
BIQH phase with the electric Hall conductance |σxy| = 2
as numerically found in Ref. [55]. We also consider the
eﬀect of a perturbation that reduces the U (1)c × U (1)s
symmetry to the U (1)c symmetry. Then we argue that
the transition between the BIQH phases is described by
two copies of the O(4) nonlinear sigma model with θ = π
when the Hamiltonian has time-reversal symmetry. At

6

¯ρa0 = 1/6, we expect a fractional quantum Hall state
called the Halperin (221) state with |σxy| = 2/3.

Here we have dropped vertex operators involving einθs
with n ≥ 2 since they will be irrelevant as we will discuss
below. For usual lattice bosons only with hopping terms,
the vertex operator takes the form ei(ϕs
j+1) and leads
j(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0. In our case, as
to the Bose condensation with (cid:104)eiϕs
a result of the correlated hopping, those terms do not ap-
pear in the theory. Instead, we have the vertex operators
j with s (cid:54)= s(cid:48), which appear to be the bound
of ϕs
states of the boson in one sublattice and the vortex in
the other sublattice. These particle-vortex bound states,
which naturally emerge in our model, may play the role
corresponding to the mutual composite bosons [58].

Eq. (29) so that any pair of the vertex operators com-
mute with each other. This is not the case when we start
from the array of ordinary bosonic chains as in Ref. [4].
Since any vertex operator contains einθs
j with even n in
that case, the vertex operators obey commutation rela-
tions. In our case, because of the string operators, the
vertex operators can be built from einθs
j with odd n and
therefore obeys anticommutation relations. This is com-
pensated by the zero-mode operators πN s
j , just like the
Klein factors in fermionic systems.

Since all the vertex operators have the same scaling
dimension 1 at the Gaussian ﬁxed point (32), which cor-
responds to free fermions, only the relative strength of
the coupling constants determines which term reaches
the strong-coupling limit faster under the renormaliza-
tion group transformation. The coupling constants obey

To be more speciﬁc, let us consider the case for α = β.
If 0 < α < π, g(α) goes the strong-coupling limit and
all the ﬁelds in the bulk, {φµ
j+1}, acquire a gap.
However, the unpaired edge modes ˜φµ
N remain
gapless at the leftmost and rightmost chains. Similarly,
for −π < α < 0, g(−α) goes the strong-coupling limit
1 and ˜φµ
and the edge modes φµ
N remain gapless. The two
BIQH phases are then characterized by the edge modes

{ ˜φµ
and BIQH− phases, respectively.

In order to demonstrate that the two BIQH phases
have opposite Hall conductances, let us consider how the
bosonic ﬁelds transform under the U (1) symmetries. As
discussed earlier, Hamiltonian (1) is invariant under the
U (1)c × U (1)s symmetry, that is the symmetry under

aj,(cid:96) → e−i(∆ωc+∆ωs)aj,(cid:96),
bj,(cid:96) → e−i(∆ωc−∆ωs)bj,(cid:96),

(36)

for arbitrary angles ∆ωc, ∆ωs ∈ [0, 2π). In the language

of the bosonic ﬁelds, these transformation can be ex-
pressed as

j (x) → ϕa
ϕa
j (x) → θa

j(x) → ϕb

j (x) + ∆ωc + ∆ωs,

Thus we have

j and φ1

For φµ
j , the basis diagonalizing the K matrix in Eq. (30)
is introduced by φ1
j . From the above
transformations, the former is the electric mode that car-
ries only the charge +2, while the latter is the pseudospin
mode that carries only the pseudospin +2. Since their
corresponding eigenvalues of K have diﬀerent signs, those
electric and pseudospin modes are counter-propagating
at the edges j = 1 and N . Accordingly, the electric and
pseudospin Hall conductances are quantized to σxy = 2
xy = −2, respectively, resulting in a vanishing ther-
and σs
mal Hall conductance [4]. A similar discussion applies to
˜φµ
j except for that the associated K matrix has an over-
all minus sign. Hence, the edge currents of ˜φµ
j ﬂow in
the opposite direction to those of φµ
j ; the conductances
become σxy = −2 and σs
xy = 2. Therefore, the BIQH+
and BIQH− phases have diﬀerent signs in the Hall con-
ductances.

j+1} for µ (cid:54)= ν have the same magnitude
and { ˜φν
in the coupling constants. However, those ﬁelds are not
commuting and thus cannot be simultaneously localized.
We expect that this point describes the phase transition
between the BIQH+ and BIQH− phases.

At α = −β, the vertex operators with {φµ

j − ˜φµ

j − φν

For general values of α and β, we obtain the phase di-
agram by using the renormalization group analysis (see
Appendix B), as shown in Fig. 4. The phase transition is
determined by the ﬁxed points at which all the coupling
constants ﬂow to the same value; this occurs at the ini-
tial coupling g(α) = g(−β). Of course, the above phase
diagram is valid only for the quasi-one-dimensional limit
so that it is not clear whether this is applicable for the
truly 2D model. Nevertheless, this phase diagram per-
fectly coincides with the one numerically obtained by in-
ﬁnite density-matrix renormalization group for the orig-
inal Hamiltonian (1). The nature of this transition is
discussed in Sec. IV C.

We note that in Eq. (33) we can in general add other
j with n ≥ 2. These can
vertex operators involving einθs
potentially drive the system into (fractional) quantum

where p and q are integers. However, the corresponding

.

(40)

Therefore, the BIQH phase is most promising at the
Gaussian ﬁxed point since the corresponding vertex op-
erators (p = q = 0) are strictly relevant. In fact, other
vertex operators that drive the system to conventional
ordered phases are at most marginal. Thus the BIQH
phase is robust against any other competing order. This
can be contrasted to the situation in Ref. [49], where the
operators leading to the chiral spin liquid are marginal.

B. Eﬀect of tunneling between two sublattices

In the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (1), both the species
of bosons are separately conserved. This gives rise to
the U (1)a × U (1)b symmetry. However, upon introduc-
ing nearest-neighbor hoppings, which allow inter-species
tunneling, only the global U (1) charge corresponding to
the conservation of the total Boson number survives.
The BIQH phase described above is stable to such inter-
species tunnelings (see Ref. [55]), as we shall show now.
To this end, we consider the following form of the tun-
nelings deﬁned on the honeycomb lattice [55],

or equivalently the U (1)c × U (1)s symmetry deﬁned in
Eq. (36). From Eq. (38), this symmetry forbids any per-
turbation of the form cos(nφµ
j ) with integer
n, which gaps out the edge modes. Thus we have quan-
tized electric and pseudospin Hall conductances in the
absence of the tunneling (41). However, once the tunnel-
ing is turned on, the U (1)c × U (1)s symmetry reduces to
the U (1)c symmetry associated with the global particle
conservation. Therefore the perturbations of the form
cos[n(φ1
j )] are allowed. How-
ever, those interactions must carry nonzero conformal
spins and cannot satisfy the Haldane’s null-vector crite-
rion [68, 69]. Thus the counter-propagating gapless edge
modes cannot be gapped as far as we keep the global par-
ticle conservation. This can also be understood that the
U (1)c symmetry “chirally” acts on the edge theory [57];
the U (1)c symmetry acts on the left- and right-moving
modes in diﬀerent ways and therefore forbids the back-
scattering gapping out the edge modes.

tials do not commute with any of those in Eq. (33), the
tunneling does not modify the qualitative nature of the
BIQH phases as long as λ is suﬃciently smaller than t(cid:48).
Although the tunnelings do not alter the physics deeply
inside the BIQH phase, their eﬀect may be crucial in the
vicinity of the transition between the BIQH phases as we
discuss below.

C. Transition between BIQH phases

We here discuss the nature of the phase transition be-
tween the two BIQH phases with the Hall conductances
σxy = ±2. Indeed, if a direct continuous transition is pos-
sible, it falls beyond traditional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson
paradigm since none of the two phases break any sym-
metry spontaneously and therefore are not described in
terms of local order parameter ﬁelds. We discuss that this
transition can be described by two copies of the O(4) non-
linear sigma model (NLSM) with the topological θ term
and thus is possibly in a deconﬁned quantum criticality
[70, 71].

FIG. 5. (Color online) Tunnelings between the two sublattices
are represented by green arrows on the links of the honey-
comb lattice. We also show the background ﬂuxes assigned in
Ref. [55], where the ﬂuxes α/3 or β/3 thread obtuse triangles
whose two vertices are in the A or B sublattice.

These tunnelings are schematically shown in Fig. 5.

In the continuum limit, these tunnelings give rise to
oscillating factors depending on the background ﬂuxes.
These oscillating factors must be canceled by certain
commensurability conditions with the ﬂuxes C of the tun-
nelings. In general, this gives rise to the following intra-
chain coupling terms

Here h
ρa0 = 1/2 and under the background ﬂuxes assigned in
Ref. [55] (see Fig. 5), the ﬁrst two terms appear when
(α + β)/3 = 0 mod 2π is satisﬁed, while the latter two
terms appear when (α + β)/3 = π mod 2π is satisﬁed. If
λ is suﬃciently smaller than the interchain coupling t(cid:48),
those interactions may be neglected in the bulk. How-
ever, at the edges j = 1 and j = N , the ﬁrst two terms
j − ˜φ2
couple with the pseudospin modes φ1
j .
Although at ﬁrst sight they appear to open gaps for the
pseudospin modes at the edges, those tunnelings cannot
localize the pseudospin modes since they do not satisfy
the Haldane’s null-vector criterion [68]; indeed each of
them does not commute with itself since they are chiral.
Thus the pseudospin edge modes still remain gapless even
after introducing the tunneling between the two sublat-
tices.

j and ˜φ1

j − φ2

From the point of view of the symmetry, this can
be easily understood as follows: Without the tunneling
(41), the system maintains the U (1)a × U (1)b symmetry,

Those spinor ﬁelds correspond to two primary ﬁelds of
the SU (2)1 WZW theory in each chiral sector. Speciﬁ-
cally, these matrix ﬁelds are given by

From Eq. (46), it is now transparent that in each of
charge and pseudospin sectors, the chain Hamiltonian
has an SU (2)R × SU (2)L symmetry. To be more pre-
cise, the SU (2)c,R × SU (2)s,L symmetry is endowed by
j , while the SU (2)s,R × SU (2)c,L symmetry
the ﬁelds φµ
is endowed by the ﬁelds ˜φµ
j . These give two diﬀerent re-
alizations of the SO(4) ∼ SU (2)R × SU (2)L symmetry
in each chain. We below mention how these SU (2) sym-
metries act on the SU (2)-matrix ﬁelds. For the charge
sector, the SU (2)c,R symmetry acts on the ﬁeld gj as
a left multiplication of U ∈ SU (2), gj → gjU, while
the SU (2)c,L symmetry acts on ˜gj as ˜gj → ˜gjV with
V ∈ SU (2). For the pseudospin sector, the SU (2)s,R
and SU (2)s,L symmetries respectively act on ˜gj and gj
as the right multiplications of elements of SU (2). This
can be easily seen from the fact that the charge U (1)
symmetry given by Eq. (37) acts as gj → gje−i∆ωcσz
and ˜gj → ˜gje−i∆ωcσz
, where σx,y,z is the Pauli matrices.
The pseudospin U (1) symmetry acts as gj → e−i∆ωsσz
gj
and ˜gj → e−i∆ωsσz ˜gj.

We can now rewrite the interaction Hamiltonian (33)
in terms of the matrix ﬁelds. For example, the ﬁrst and
third terms of Eq. (33) are expressed as

We below proceed in the following steps: We ﬁrst
show that the chain Hamiltonian (32) is equivalent to the
SU (2)1 Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models and then
the interaction (33) can be expressed in terms of SU (2)-
matrix ﬁelds. It reveals that the Hamiltonian possesses
an SO(4) × SO(4) symmetry for special values of α and
β. Following the argument by Senthil and Fisher [72], we
show that the Hamiltonian is equivalent to two copies of
the (2 + 1)-dimensional O(4) NLSM with θ = π, which
are presumably equivalent to two copies of the two-ﬂavor
massless QED3.

Let us introduce chiral bosonic ﬁelds corresponding to

ρ(cid:48),j(cid:48)(x(cid:48))] = −iπδρρ(cid:48)δjj(cid:48)δ(x − x(cid:48)),

with ρ = c, s. At the boundary j = 1 or N , those ﬁelds
represent nothing but the counter-propagating gapless
edge modes discussed before.

Each chain Hamiltonian is composed of the two hard-
core bosonic chains. As it can be mapped onto the tight-
binding Hamiltonian of spinful electrons, it possesses a
charge SU (2) symmetry as well as a pseudospin SU (2)
symmetry at half ﬁlling. Thus the chain Hamiltonian
(32) is described by 2N copies of the SU (2)1 WZW the-
ory [73, 74],

(55)

Diﬀerent signs in the θ terms for G1,2 originate from the
fact that one layer of the network model has the oppo-
site current structure to another layer [see Fig. 6 (b)].
Since the (2+1)-dimensional O(4) NLSM at θ = π has
been suggested to be equivalent to the two-ﬂavor mass-
less QED3 [72, 77], we have two copies of the two-ﬂavor
massless QED3 at the time-reversal-symmetric transi-
tion point between the two BIQH phases; two ﬂavors
of the Dirac fermion transform to another two under the
time-reversal symmetry. Possible transitions described
by QED3 between BIQH phases have also been argued
by the parton construction of the BIQH phase [35, 37].

The BIQH phases can be obtained from the above
NLSM as follows. Away from the critical point t1 = t2,
a staggered structure of the tunneling may modify the
coeﬃcients of the θ terms as [78]

iπ(1 − δ)Sθ[G1] − iπ(1 + δ)Sθ[G2],

(56)

where we have set t1 = t(1 + δ) and t2 = t(1 − δ). For
t1 (cid:28) t2, the low-energy physics may be governed by the
O(4) NLSM with θ = 2π for G1 and that with θ = 0
for G2. For a large value of g0, the O(4) NLSM is disor-
dered in the bulk but has the critical (1+1)-dimensional
SU (2)1 WZW theories at the boundaries when θ = 2π
[58, 79]. For t1 (cid:29) t2, the physics may be governed by the
O(4) NLSM with θ = 0 for G1 and that with θ = −2π
for G2. The O(4) NLSM with θ = −2π also gives the
boundary WZW theories but with the charge and pseu-
dospin currents ﬂowing in the opposite directions to those
at θ = 2π.
However, the BIQH phases break the time-reversal
symmetry so that there always exist U (1) × U (1)
anisotropies. Thus the SO(4) symmetry must be re-
duced to the U (1) × U (1) symmetry. This is also the
case for the phase transition between the BIQH phases
when the time-reversal symmetry is broken. The result-
ing eﬀective theory at the transition may be described
by two copies of the easy-plane non-compact CP 1 model
[72]. The tunneling between the two sublattices further
reduces the symmetry to a U (1)×Z2 symmetry. The fate
of the transition may become (i) the ﬁrst-order transition
or (ii) some intermediate phase.

FIG. 6. (Color online) Network models describing the phase
transitions between two BIQH phases. Red (blue) circles cor-
respond to charge (pseudospin) modes, and cross (dotted)
symbols represent right-moving (left-moving) modes. Four
modes enclosed by the dashed line represent the degrees of
freedom in a physical bosonic chain. t1 and t2 are two diﬀer-
ent tunnelings between the two counter-propagating modes.
(a) The model studied in Refs. [5, 76]: One may ﬁnd the
trivial phase when t1 (cid:29) t2 while the BIQH+ phase when
t1 (cid:28) t2. (b) Our model: One may ﬁnd the BIQH− phase
when t1 (cid:29) t2 while the BIQH+ phase when t1 (cid:28) t2.
In
both cases, the phase transitions between the two phases are
expected at t1 = t2.

and the second term represents anisotropies that reduce
the SO(4) symmetry to the U (1)×U (1) symmetry, which
is the genuine microscopic symmetry in the absence of
inter-species tunneling. As seen from Eq. (51), for gen-
eral values of α and β, there exist the U (1) × U (1)
anisotropies. However, at the time-reversal-symmetric
points where α and β take 0 or π, the eﬀective low-energy
theory has the SO(4) symmetry. In those cases, Eq. (33)
j ↔ − ˜φµ
is invariant under the time-reversal symmetry φµ
since g(α) = g(−α) and γ(α) = γ(−α) (the same rela-
tions hold for β). We further have g(α) = g(β) at those
points, because of lattice symmetries that interchange the
two sublattices. Then we can eliminate the phase shifts
j − γ(α)
γ by the redeﬁnition of the ﬁelds, e.g. φ1
and φ2

j → φ1

j → φ2

j + γ(β).

j

Thus, when the time-reversal symmetry exists, the
phase transition between the BIQH+ and BIQH− phases
may be governed by the SO(4) symmetric Hamiltonian
H0 + HSO(4) with t1 = t2. This Hamiltonian is similar
to the network model studied for the phase transition
between the BIQH and trivial Mott-insulating phases in
Refs. [5, 76]. The latter network model has an SO(4)
symmetry and is depicted in Fig. 6 (a). However, our
model takes a bilayer structure as shown in Fig. 6 (b)
and has an SO(4) × SO(4) symmetry. With n being in-
teger, one SO(4) symmetry acts only on g2n and ˜g2n+1,
while the other acts only on g2n+1 and ˜g2n. As discussed
in Ref. [72] (see also Ref. [5]), after taking the continuum
limit in the direction perpendicular to the chains, each
layer of the network model gives the (2 + 1)-dimensional
O(4) NLSM with the topological θ terms at θ = π. The

with the K matrix,

(61)

The K matrix (61) indicates that the resulting gapped
phase is in the Halperin (221) state [63], which is a frac-
tional quantum Hall state with the fractional electric Hall
conductance σxy = ±2/3 and the integer pseudospin Hall
xy = ±2. As opposed to the BIQH phase
conductance σs
at ¯ρa0 = 1/2, this phase supports chiral edge states, that
is, the electric and pseudospin currents ﬂow in the same
direction. Moreover, the ground state on a torus is three-
fold degenerate because of the anyonic statistics of the
quasiparticle excitations. Thus we have the possibility of
a topologically ordered phase in the same model but just
at the diﬀerent ﬁlling ¯ρa0 = 1/6.
As in the same manner of Sec. IV A, the relative
strength of the coupling constants f (α) and f (−α) deter-
mines the chirality of currents. However, the correspond-
ing vertex operators now have the scaling dimension 3

12

and thus irrelevant at the Gaussian ﬁxed point. This
suggests that for a perturbatively small t(cid:48), the ground
state is in a sliding-Luttinger-liquid phase with forward
scatterings generated by higher-order perturbations [80]
or some conventional ordered phase. Nevertheless, it is
natural to expect that the Halperin (221) state is realized
for a certain strong value of t(cid:48) beyond the perturbative
regime unless some competing ordered phase is found.
This phase is also expected to be realized at the ﬁlling
¯ρa0 = 5/6.

Since our model favors the mutual composite boson,
which is the bound state of a boson in one sublattice and
a vortex in the other sublattice, the Halperin (221) is
also a natural candidate; the Halperin (221) state is ob-
tained by further attaching two ﬂux quanta of itself to the
mutual composite boson. Both the BIQH and Halperin
(221) states are in fact found in the two-component Bose
gas with two-body interactions [59, 60, 81]. We note that
both of them have also been proposed to be realized in a
spin-1 lattice Hamiltonian [36]. In that case, which state
actually realizes depends on the Chern numbers of a free-
fermion Hamiltonian before the projection onto the spin-
1 Hilbert space. In our lattice model, both states can be
potentially realized solely by tuning the ﬁlling factor of
the bosons in the same Hamiltonian.

V. CONCLUSION

We studied hard-core bosons interacting via correlated
hoppings in an anisotropic deformation of the honey-
comb lattice. A variant of the Jordan-Wigner transfor-
mation is introduced to resolve the correlated hopping in
each chain, while it leaves nonlocal interactions between
chains. Applying bosonization techniques and using the
the coupled-wire construction, we found that the BIQH
phase is realized at half ﬁlling.
Interestingly, in terms
of the bosonic ﬁelds, the nonlocal interaction between
chains can be seen as a hopping of the mutual compos-
ite bosons, which are bound states of the boson in one
sublattice and the vortex in the other sublattice; by con-
densing them, one can obtain the BIQH phase [58]. Thus
it appears that the correlated hopping is a natural way
to implement a mutual ﬂux attachment in lattice sys-
tems. We also discussed the stability of the BIQH phase
against the tunneling between the two sublattices. Based
on the eﬀective O(4) NLSM description, we argued that
the transition between the two BIQH phases is in a de-
conﬁned quantum criticality when time-reversal symme-
try is maintained. We further provided the possibility to
stabilize the Halperin (221) state at 1/6 and 5/6 ﬁllings.
Compared to previous numerical results [55], this work
strongly suggests that the spatially anisotropic (quasi-
one-dimensional) limit and the isotropic honeycomb lat-
tice are smoothly connected for the BIQH state in the
present model. Furthermore, the BIQH phases are found
even when the bosons on the diﬀerent sublattices feel
diﬀerent staggered ﬂuxes. On the other hand, a sliding

Luttinger liquid will take the place of the Halperin (221)
state in the anisotropic limit since the corresponding in-
teractions are irrelevant. However, as far as competing
ordinarily ordered states are suppressed by frustration,
the Halperin (221) state is considered to be the most
promising candidate of possible phases on the isotropic
model. We leave the question about the actual realiza-
tion of this state in the isotropic model for future work.
In the present analysis, we obtained the eﬀective de-
scription of the transition between the two BIQH phases
in a somewhat intricate way; we ﬁrst mapped our model
to the O(4) NLSM and then used the putative equiv-
alence between the O(4) NLSM with the θ term at
θ = π and the two-ﬂavor massless QED3. On the other
hand, Mross, Alicea, and Motrunich recently demon-
strated that the two-ﬂavor QED3 can be directly ob-
tained within the coupled-wire approach without passing
through the NLSM [82]. This alternative approach may
provide more physical insights about the nature of the
transition, e.g., the transformation properties of Dirac
fermions under the symmetry. We also note that the
model studied in this paper is in fact related to an eﬀec-
tive lattice-gauge-theoretical description of the kagome
antiferromagnet [83, 84]. Therefore a more detailed study
of the transition will be an important task to understand
the spin-liquid ground state of the kagome antiferromag-
net.

Needless to say, the present coupled-wire approach is
not restricted to our speciﬁc example. The bosonization
approach combined with the idea of coupled-wire con-
struction to an anisotropic lattice will be applied to the
broad class of interacting lattice models and topological
phases. To propose experimentally relevant models for
condensed matter or optical lattice systems in this way
will be a more challenging but very interesting direction
in the future.

Combined with Eq. (A1),
for ¯ρa0 = 1/2, this gives
the coupling constants just scaled by 1/π from those of

Hamiltonian (33), and the phase shifts of the cosine po-
tentials are also modiﬁed. For ¯ρa0 = 1/6, we obtain the
Hamiltonian of the form (57), but the coupling constant
f (α) is replaced by

˜f (α) =

Correspondingly, the phase shifts also become more com-
plicated functions in α and β. However, the relative

14
strength between ˜f (α) and ˜f (−α) still holds the same
property as f (α), that is |f (α)/f (−α)| > 1 for 0 < α <
π. Therefore, regardless of the diﬀerent continuum ex-
pressions of the Hamiltonian, we obtain the same low-
energy physics in both cases.

Appendix B: Renormalization group analysis

To obtain the phase diagram for general values of the
staggered ﬂuxes α and β, we here analyze the renormal-
ization group (RG) equations of the coupling constants
in Eq. (33). We consider the Hamiltonian,

Here we have neglected the phase shifts in the cosine potentials since it does not aﬀect the present analysis. We have
also explicitly introduced the stiﬀness (or the Luttinger parameter) Ks for each species of the original bosonic ﬁelds.
˜φ2 in Eq. (32). The
A deviation from Ks = 1 corresponds to the generation of marginal terms ∂xφ1∂xφ2 and ∂x
vertex operators proportional to ˜qn,j (n = 1, 2) are not originally included in Hamiltonian (33), but those operators are
generated by second-order perturbations ˜g1,j±1˜g3,j and ˜g2,j±1˜g4,j under the RG transformation. While similar vertex
operators can also be generated by perturbations ˜g1,j±1˜g4,j and ˜g2,j±1˜g3,j, those have nonzero conformal spins ±1
and do not contribute to the RG equations of the coupling constants ˜gn,j (n = 1,··· , 4) at the one-loop level. Using
the standard RG method combined with the operator product expansion [85] and setting ˜gn,j ≡ ˜gn and ˜qn,j ≡ ˜qn, we
obtain the RG equations,

where Gn = ˜gn/πv and Qn = ˜qn/πv. Initial couplings
are given by Ka(0) = Kb(0) = 1, ˜g1(0) = −π2t(cid:48)c2
1a0g(α),
˜g2(0) = −π2t(cid:48)c2
1a0g(−α), ˜g3(0) = −π2t(cid:48)c2
1a0g(β),
˜g4(0) = −π2t(cid:48)c2
1a0g(−β), and ˜q1(0) = ˜q2(0) = 0 [see
Eq. (34a) for the deﬁnition of g(α)]. By inclusion of Qn,
pairs of the coupling constants {G1, G2} and {G3, G4}
cannot independently ﬂow under the RG transformation
and are coupled via Qn. Thus the symmetry of the equa-
tions under G1 ↔ G2 is broken by the asymmetry under
G3 ↔ G4, and vise versa. One can also add other ver-
tex operators generated by second-order perturbations,
but they maintain this symmetry and have no essential
contributions to the RG ﬂows of ˜gn.
By numerically integrating the RG equations, we ﬁnd
that there exists a nontrivial ﬁxed point ˜gn = ˜g∗ → −∞
and Ks = 1 when the initial couplings satisfy ˜g1(0) =

˜g4(0) and ˜g2(0) = ˜g3(0). This initial condition corre-
sponds to the transition lines in the phase diagram of
Fig. 4. Such a ﬁxed point has also been found in the slid-
ing Luttinger liquid perturbed by the vertex operators
of dual ﬁelds [86]. Our result can be seen as an exten-
sion of their result to a two-component sliding Luttinger
liquid. A deviation from the above initial condition im-
mediately gives the BIQH phases described by the ﬁxed
points ˜g∗
We also remark that for arbitrary initial values of
˜gn, we can also ﬁnd other ﬁxed points (˜g∗
4) =
(±∞,±∞, 0, 0) or (0, 0,±∞,±∞). These ﬁxed points
describe ordered phases where the bosons condense in
one sublattice while the vortices condense in the other
sublattice. However, these phases are not realized in the
parameter space of Hamiltonian (33).
