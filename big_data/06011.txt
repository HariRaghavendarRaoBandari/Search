Abstract

These notes are based on the lectures delivered at the Les Houches Summer School in July 2015. They
are addressed at a mixed audience of physicists and mathematicians with some basic working knowledge of
random matrix theory. The ﬁrst part is devoted to the solution of the chiral Gaussian Unitary Ensemble
in the presence of characteristic polynomials, using orthogonal polynomial techniques. This includes all
eigenvalue density correlation functions, smallest eigenvalue distributions and their microscopic limit at
the origin. These quantities are relevant for the description of the Dirac operator spectrum in Quantum
Chromodynamics with three colours in four Euclidean space-time dimensions. In the second part these two
theories are related based on symmetries, and the random matrix approximation is explained. In the last
part recent developments are covered including the eﬀect of ﬁnite chemical potential and ﬁnite space-time
lattice spacing, and their corresponding orthogonal polynomials. We also give some open random matrix
problems.

Introduction and motivation

In this short introduction we would like to introduce the two players in the title, Random Matrix Theory (RMT)
and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), on a superﬁcial level. This gives a motivation why and where it will
be beneﬁcial to relate these two seemingly unrelated theories, and what the reader may expect to learn from
these notes.

Let us begin with QCD, the theory of the strong interactions1. It is part of the standard model of elementary

1I apologise for being very elementary here, my audience was not assumed to know particle or general physics.

particles that also describes the weak and electromagnetic interactions among all elementary particles. The latter
two interactions will however not play any role here. The particle content of QCD are the Nf quarks with masses
mq, q = 1, . . . , Nf , and the gluons. In nature Nf = 6 ﬂavours have been observed named up, down, strange,
charm, top and bottom quark. In the following we will keep Nf as a free parameter, and often consider only
the lightest up and down quark (Nf = 2) as they constitute the most common particles as proton (p), neutron
(n) and pions (π±,0). The quarks interact through the gluons, the carriers of force, with a coupling constant
gs. Both come in 3 colours and the interaction is described through a ﬁeld strength and covariant derivative
carrying an SU (3) Lie group structure. QCD is a strongly interacting, relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT)
which is very diﬃcult. Fortunately we will only need to know a few features and some of its global symmetries
that will be described in Section 3. For a standard textbook on perturbative QCD we refer for example to [1].
Roughly speaking QCD has two diﬀerent phases that are schematically depicted in Figure 1. They are char-
acterised by an order parameter, the chiral condensate Σ. At high energies corresponding to high temperatures
T, Σ = 0 and quarks and gluons form a plasma, that has been observed in collision experiments e.g. at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC in Brookhaven. This phase also existed in the early universe, with the
cooling down happening close to the temperature axis at low Baryon density parametrised by µ. In these situa-
tions as well as in single particle collisions produced at collider experiments a perturbative expansion in powers
of the coupling gs typically applies, as described e.g. in [1]. The second phase with Σ (cid:54)= 0 at low temperature
and density is the one in which we live. Here quarks condense into colourless objects, that is into Baryons made
of 3 quarks of diﬀerent colour adding up to white (like p or n), or Mesons made of a quark and an anti-quark
with its anti-colour (like the π’s). Gluons are also conﬁned to these objects, and a proof of conﬁnement of
quarks and gluons from QCD is still considered to be an open millennium problem. In QCD it happens that
conﬁnement goes along with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry - hence the name of Σ. This global
symmetry will be described in detail later, and eventually lead us to a RMT description.

two massless quark ﬂavours. The chemical potential is proportional to the Baryon density. For massless ﬂavours
mq = 0 the dashed line corresponds to a second order phase transition, merging with the full line representing
a ﬁrst order transition in a tricritical point.

In the phase with Σ (cid:54)= 0 perturbation theory breaks down and one has to apply other methods.

If one
wants to continue to work with ﬁrst principles and the QCD action, one possibility is to study QCD on a ﬁnite
space-time lattice of volume V and lattice spacing a, equipped with a Euclidean metric. The numerical solution
of this theory nowadays reproduces the masses of particles that are composed of elementary ones to a very high
precision, as testiﬁed in the particle data booklet [2]. To that aim two limits have to be made, the continuum
limit sending a → 0 and the thermodynamical limit sending V → ∞. For a standard textbook on lattice QCD
we refer to [3]. A second possibility is to approximate QCD in the conﬁned phase by eﬀective theories, that
describe for example only the low energy excitation. One of these is chiral perturbation theory (chPT), see
[4] for a review, that describes the low momentum modes that appear after the spontaneous breaking of chiral
symmetry, the so-called Goldstone Bosons. Another such theory is RMT. It should be clear by now that RMT
will not solve QCD (nor chPT), in the continuum or on the lattice. However, it will describe certain aspects in

2

a analytical fashion, namely the spectral properties of the small eigenvalues of the QCD Dirac operator D/. In
a ﬁnite volume the density of eigenvalues of D/ satisﬁes the Banks-Casher relation [5]

which relates it to the described setup. In particular RMT will predict the detailed dependence on the parameters
mq, µ, a, and V after being appropriately rescaled, as well as on a the zero-eigenvalues of D/ which relate to a
topological index ν. And most remarkably these predictions have been veriﬁed in comparison to lattice QCD
by many groups. We will not repeat these ﬁndings here are refer to the literature at the end of each section.

The idea to apply RMT to QCD goes back to the seminal works [6, 7] that started from the simplest case
with Nf = 0 which is called quenched approximation, at µ = 0 = a. The ﬁeld has since developed enormously,
leading to the detailed analytical knowledge that we will describe. There exist a number of excellent reviews
already, [8, 9], notably the lecture notes from the Les Houches session in 2004 by J. Verbaarschot [10]. This
brings me to the main goals of these lecture notes, to be addressed in the order of the subsequent sections. What
can we predict from RMT that can be compared to lattice QCD? In Section 2 we will start with the solution
of the corresponding RMT using the theory of orthogonal polynomials. This section is rather mathematical
and contains no further physics input. The second question, what is the limit in which QCD reduces to RMT
is addressed in Section 3. Here the global symmetries of QCD are explained, leading to chPT and eventually
to a RMT description. The more physics inclined reader may jump to this section ﬁrst. One of my personal
motivations why to add another review on this topic is answered in Section 4 where the development in the last
10 years is reviewed, including some mathematical aspects. This covers the dependence on ﬁnite lattice spacing
a and on chemical potential µ, for an earlier review on the latter see [11].

Let us move to RMT, where I assume that the reader has already some working knowledge. RMT is a
much older topic, beginning in the late 1920’s with Wishart in mathematical statistics and in the late 1950’s
with Wigner and Dyson in nuclear physics. The number of its applications is huge and still increasing, and
we refer to [12] for applications to quantum physics and to [13] for a recent compilation containing physics
(including QCD in chapter 32), mathematics and more. In these lecture notes we will focus only on the theory
of orthogonal polynomials. For the standard Gaussian ensembles they are covered in the last edition of Mehta’s
classical book [14], for more recent monographs see [15, 16]. The symmetry class we will be interested in for
the application to QCD is the chiral Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (chGUE), which is also known as Wishart
or Laguerre Unitary ensemble, and extensions thereof.
In the simplest case of Nf = 0 and when all the
abovementioned parameters from QCD are absent it is deﬁned by the probability space of complex N × N
matrices W . All its matrix elements are independent and share the same complex normal distribution. The
mean density ρ(x) of the positive eigenvalues of W W †, where † denotes the Hermitian conjugate, is well known
in the limit N → ∞. After an appropriate rescaling it is given by the Marchenko-Pastur law depicted in Figure
2, cf. the lectures by Bouchaud where this was derived. The same law is obtained when taking real or quaternion
valued matrix elements, constituting the chiral Gaussian Orthogonal and Symplectic Ensemble (chGOE and

chGSE), respectively. However, the local statistics of the 3 ensembles diﬀers, and depends on the location in the
spectrum we consider. For ﬁnite N the eigenvalue statistics follows a determinantal (chGUE) or Pfaﬃan point
process (chGOE, chGSE), and the limiting kernels in the various locations of the spectrum shown in Figure 2
are given in terms of Bessel, Sine or Airy functions. In view of the relation (1) we will be interested in the local
statistics for the chGUE at the origin also called hard edge. The other two symmetry classes at the hard edge
will also ﬁnd applications in QFT as pointed out in [17], cf.
[8], but will not be discussed here. In the limit
xj and thus come
in pairs, where xj are the eigenvalues of W (the positive part +
xj are the singular values of W ). After this
change of variables the Marchenko-Pastur law becomes a semi-circle, which is why the global density of D/ at
the origin will become constant (and not divergent as in Figure 2). For ﬁnite N the chGUE can be solved in
terms of the classical Laguerre polynomials. It will be the content of Sections 2 and 4 to include more structure
from QCD into this RMT, while maintaining its exact solvability.

√

2 Orthogonal polynomial approach to the Dirac operator spectrum

In this section we go directly to the RMT of QCD in an eigenvalue representation that generalises the chGUE,
by including the mass terms of Nf quark ﬂavours. In Subsection 2.1 we brieﬂy recall the orthogonal polynomial
(OP) formalism and deﬁne the quantities of our interest. We then attack the mathematical problem of computing
these by deriving properties of OP with a general weight, in particular including averages of characteristic
polynomials in Subsection 2.2. This allows us to determine all quantities explicitly in terms of standard Laguerre
polynomials in Subsection 2.3, which facilitates the large-N limit to be taken in Subsection 2.4.

2.1 The eigenvalue model and deﬁnition of its correlation functions

We begin by stating the RMT that we want to solve in its eigenvalue representation, deﬁned by the following
partition function

Nf(cid:89)

|∆N ({x})|β =

It gives the normalisation constant of the unnormalised joint probability density function (jpdf) Pjpdf (x1, . . . , xN )
of all eigenvalues. Here we have included the dependence on the following parameters to be related to QCD
later: ν = 0, 1, 2, . . . called the topological index taking ﬁxed values, the masses mf ∈ R+, f = 1, 2, . . . , Nf ,
with Nf counting the number of inserted characteristic polynomials. In the quenched theory with Nf = 0 their
product is absent. These parameters are all collected in the weight function

and ﬁnally we also have introduced the Vandermonde determinant

It depends on the set of all eigenvalues {x} = {xi}i=1,...,N . The partition function eq.
(2) is relevant for
QCD for β = 2, representing the chGUE in the presence of Nf characteristic polynomials (mass terms). For
completeness and in order to state some open problems later we have also introduced the chGOE and chGSE
with β = 1 and 4, respectively. All three RMT are also called Wishart-Laguerre ensembles and can be written
in matrix representation,

Here W is an N×(N +ν) matrix taking values Wij ∈ R/C/H for β = 1, 2, 4 respectively, and W † is its Hermitian
conjugate. The integration [dW ] is over the ﬂat Lebesgue measure of all independent matrix elements. The
identity matrices in front of the scalar mass variables mf of dimensions N and N + ν are denoted by 1N and
1N +ν, respectively. Here we see that ν counts the number of zero eigenvalues of the Wishart matrix W †W , and
the xj, j = 1, . . . , N denote its non-zero positive eigenvalues2. The change of variables from matrix elements
to eigenvalues leads to the Vandermonde determinant to the power β = 1, 2, 4 times the ν-dependent part as
the Jacobian, and we refer to standard text books on RMT for the derivation [14, 16]. In the lectures of J.-P.
Bouchaud these ensembles were discussed for Nf = 0, in particular when ν is of the order of N . This matrix
representation eq. (5) will play an important role later in Section 3 when relating the RMT to QCD based on
symmetries. In the following we will mainly focus on the chGUE with β = 2 which is the RMT relevant for
QCD. The values β = 1 and 4 apply to other QFTs and are very brieﬂy discussed at the end of Subsection 2.3.
What are the quantities we would like to calculate as functions of the masses mf and ν, apart from the
normalising partition function? The jpdf represents a determinantal (or Pfaﬃan) point process introduced in
the lectures by A. Borodin. Therefore we can determine all k-point eigenvalue density correlations deﬁned for
all β as

For β = 1, 4 similar expressions exist in terms of Pfaﬃan determinants of a matrix kernel of OP with respect to a
skew symmetric inner product replacing eq. (9). These are called skew OP and we refer to [14, 16] for details. We
choose the OP in eq. (9) to be monic, Pk(x) = xk + O(xk−1), with squared norms hk = ||Pk||2. In particular eq.
(6) leads to the spectral density R1(x) = w(x)KN (x, x) (normalised to N ) and to the determinantal expression
for the jpdf, RN (x1, . . . , xN ) = N !Pjpdf (x1, . . . , xN )/Z (β,Nf ,ν)
. Two further quantities can be deﬁned that are
of our interest. The k-th gap probability deﬁned for all β reads

It is the probability that k eigenvalues are in [0, s] and N − k in [s,∞). For example E0(s) gives the gap
probability that the interval [0, s] is empty. If we order the eigenvalues x1 < x2 < . . . < xN the k-th eigenvalue

0 ds pk(s) = 1, as can be easily checked (see e.g.
the appendix of [18]). We will be mostly interested in the example of the distribution of the smallest non-zero
eigenvalue, p1(s). Equations (10) and (11) are not independent, in fact the latter follow by diﬀerentiation:

E0(s) = −p1(s) ,

2For quaternionic matrix elements the eigenvalues are doubly degenerate (Kramer’s degeneracy), which is why for β = 4 we
always have an even number 2Nf of doubly degenerate masses in eq. (2). We will come back to this at the end of Subsection 2.3.

The gap probabilities can also be expressed in terms of the kernel KN (x, y) as a Fredholm determinant, cf. the
lectures by A. Borodin and eqs. (48) and (49), but we will use a diﬀerent route to computed them explicitly.

Our goal is now to determine all the quantities that we have introduced in this subsection, including the
partition function. For Nf = 0 this would be an easy task as the polynomials orthogonal with respect to
w(x) = xν exp[−x] are the well known Laguerre polynomials. It turns out that also for Nf > 0 we can express
all quantities in terms of Laguerre polynomials, including the dependence on the parameter mf and ν that we
are after. This will be the goal of the following 2 subsections.

2.2 Properties of orthogonal polynomials with general weights

The ﬁrst part of this subsection is standard material about OP on the real line and can be found in any standard
reference, e.g. in [19] including also OP in the complex plane needed later. For the second part with weights
containing characteristic polynomials we refer to [20] for more details.

Let us consider a general measurable weight function on the positive real half line with the condition that

0 dxw(x)xk < ∞. The monic polynomials Pk(x) orthogonal with respect to w(x)

can then be recursively constructed using Gram-Schmidt, expressing them as the ratio of two determinants:

all moments exist, Mk =(cid:82) ∞

(14)

see [19] for details. It obviously satisﬁes Pk(x) = xk +O(xk−1). These polynomials obey a three-step recurrence
relation,

xPk(x) = Pk+1(x) + αk

kPk(x) + αk−1

k Pk−1(x) ,

which can be see as follows. With the Pk(x) forming a complete set we can expand

xPk(x) =

k = h−1

Using that in the last integral xPl(x) is a polynomial of degree l + 1 and the orthogonality eq. (9) it follows that
k = 0 for l < k − 1 and αk−1
αl
hk the recursion
eq. (15) becomes more symmetric,

√
k = hk/hk−1. For the orthonormal polynomials ˆPk(x) = Pk(x)/

ˆPk(x) + ck−1 ˆPk−1(x) , ck−1 =(cid:112)hk/hk−1 , k ≥ 1 ,

x ˆPk(x) = ck ˆPk+1(x) + αk
k

and we obtain the Christoﬀel-Darboux formula for the kernel

KN (x, y) =

ˆPk(x) ˆPk(y) = cN−1

ˆPN (x) ˆPN−1(y) − ˆPN−1(x) ˆPN (y)

x − y

, x (cid:54)= y .

N−1(cid:88)

l=0

This simply follows by multiplying the sum by (x − y) with x (cid:54)= y, using the recursion and the fact that this is
a telescopic sum. From l’Hˆopital’s rule for the kernel at equal arguments we see that in the asymptotic limit
N → ∞ we only need to evaluate the asymptotic of PN (x), PN−1(x), their derivatives, and the ratio of norms
cN to determine the spectral density:

R1(x) = w(x)KN (x, x) = cN−1( ˆPN (x) ˆP (cid:48)

N−1(x) − ˆPN−1(x) ˆP (cid:48)

N (x)).

Let us give two examples. For the GUE with weight w(x) = exp[−x2/2] on R instead of R+ we have

2π n! ,

Pn(x) = Hen(x) , hn =

the probabilist’s Hermite polynomials. Second, for the Laguerre weight w(x) = xν exp[−x], eq. (3) with Nf = 0
on R+, the monic OP are given by the appropriately rescaled generalised Laguerre polynomials Lν

n(x):

Pn(x) = (−1)nn!Lν

n(x) , hn = n!Γ(n + ν + 1) , ν > −1 ,

(21)

where ν can also be real here. The asymptotic analysis of the kernel (and density) can now be made, and we
will come back to this in Subsection 2.4.

In the following we will express the partition function, corresponding OPs, kernel and gap probability E0(s)
in terms of expectation values of characteristic polynomials in a ﬁrst step, and then reduce them to determinants
of Laguerre polynomials in a second step. In order to prepare this the following exercise is very useful.

Consider the 2 Vandermode determinants eq. (4) inside the partition function (2) for β = 2. By adding
columns inside the Vandermonde determinant we do not change its value. Starting with the last column of
highest degree we can thus express ∆N ({x}) in terms of arbitrary monic polynomials Qk(x):

∆N ({x}) = det
1≤i,j≤N

[Qj−1(xi)] .

(22)

Choosing those monic polynomials Qk(x) = Pk(x) that precisely satisfy the orthogonality relation (9) we obtain
for the partition function:

(cid:19)2

(23)

In the second step we have Laplace expanded both determinants into sums over permutations σ, σ(cid:48) ∈ SN and
used the orthogonality (9). The computation of the partition function thus amounts to determine the squared
norms of the OPs with respect to the weight eq. (3).
Let us deﬁne the expectation value of an operator O({x}) that only depends on the set of eigenvalues {x}:

It is given by the expectation value of a characteristic polynomial with respect to L eigenvalues for an arbitrary

It can also be expressed in terms of matrices of size L, choosing O({x}) =
det[x − W W †]. This relation is known as the Heine formula, dating back to the 19th century. The proof uses
the simple identity for the Vandermonde determinant,

Here the orthogonality of the polynomials enforces σ(cid:48)(L + 1) = L + 1, and the remaining norms cancel due to
eq. (23). As a check also the leading coeﬃcient of eq. (25) can be compared, taking the asymptotic limit x (cid:29) 1
which leads to xL + O(xL−1) on both sides.

Note that eq. (25) provides an L-fold integral representation of the PL(x) for an arbitrary weight function.
Compared to the known single integral representation, e.g. for the Hermite polynomials in the example in eq.
(20), we thus have the following duality relation

Here we take a single average over n copies of characteristic polynomials. The existence of such relations between
1- and n-fold averages of characteristic polynomials are known only for Gaussian weights. They can also be
derived using the supersymmetric method as reviewed in chapter 7 of [13] by Thomas Guhr, see also [21] for
further dualities using OP techniques.

In the next step we will express the kernel itself as an expectation value of two characteristic polynomials,

following the work of P. Zinn-Justin [22]. Namely it holds that

Compared to eq. (27) the orthogonality only implies σ(N + 1) = σ(cid:48)(N + 1), and its value can still run over all
possible values from 1 to N + 1. In the last line we give the expression for the kernel KN +1(x, y) in terms of
the Christoﬀel-Darboux formula (18), using monic polynomials instead. Once again the leading coeﬃcients of
left and right hand side can be see to agree ∼ (xy)N in the limit x, y (cid:29) 1.

n (x) the OP with respect to weight w[l](x) = ((cid:81)l
An immediate question arises: what is the expectation value for more than two products of characteristic
polynomials? For that purpose let us introduce some more notation following Baik, Deift and Strahov [20], to
j=1(yj − x))w(x)
where we refer for more details. Denote by P [l]
for l = 1, 2, . . ., with P [0]
(cid:19)−1

n (x) = Pn(x). The following relation holds which is called Christoﬀel formula:

. . . Pn+l(yn)
. . . Pn+l(x)

As explained in [20] this can be see as follows. It is clear that the determinant in the middle, which we call
n (x)/(x − y1)··· (x − yl)
q[l]
n (x), is a polynomial of degree n + l in x. It has zeros at x = y1, . . . , yl, and thus q[l]
is a polynomial of degree n in x. Thus we have that

due to Pn(x) being OP with respect to weight w(x), after cancelling the factors from w[l](x). The last factor in
n (x) is monic, as can bee seen from taking the limit x (cid:29) 1. The repeated product of
eq. (31) ensures that P [l]
the Christoﬀel formula (31) leads to the following theorem (see Theorem 2.3 [20]) for the average of products
of l + 1 characteristic polynomials with l = 1, 2, . . ., which is due to Br´ezin and Hikami [23]:

In the product almost all factors cancel out. The case for a single characteristic polynomial with l + 1 = 1 in
eq. (33) was already stated eq. (25).

In [20] in Theorem 3.2 a further identity was derived for the expectation value of the product of an even num-
ber of characteristic polynomials, expressing it through a determinant of kernels divided by two Vandermonde

The simplest example for this relation was derived in eq. (29). In [24] this set of identities was further generalised,
expressing the expectation value of arbitrary products of characteristic polynomials by a determinant containing
both kernels and polynomials divided by two Vandermonde determinants in many diﬀerent and equivalent ways,
cf. eq. (133). The simplest example with 3 products reads [24]

The fact that both sides agree ∼ x−L for x (cid:29) 1 can be easily seen from the deﬁnition (37), expanding the
geometric series and using the orthogonality of the polynomial Pk(t) to monic powers less than k.

A second particularly important example is the expectation value of the ratio of two characteristic polyno-

mials, due to the following relation to the resolvent or Stieltjes transform G(x):

There are many examples where the OP technique is not available, but where the expectation value of ratios of
characteristic polynomials can be found by other means, e.g. by using supersymmetry,replics or loop equations.
This then leads to an alternative way to determine the spectral density, or higher k-point correlation functions,
by taking the average over k resolvents and then taking the imaginary parts with respect to each of the k
arguments. We refer to chapters 7, 8 and 16 in [13] for further details and references.

2.3 All correlation functions with masses in terms of Laguerre polynomials

Using the results from the previous subsection we are now ready to express the partition function, OPs, kernel,
and consequently all k-point correlation functions with Nf characteristic polynomials, as well as the correspond-
ing gap probabilities through expectation values of characteristic polynomials with respect to the quenched
weight w(x) = xν exp[−x] with Nf = 0. Because the OP of this quenched weight are Laguerre polynomials,
everything will be ﬁnally expressed through these, which yields explicit and exact expressions for any ﬁnite N
and Nf . In the next Subsection 2.4 will use them to take the large-N limit based on the known asymptotic of
the Laguerre polynomials.

We shall adopt the notation from the previous section, labelling all the above listed quantities by superscript
[Nf ] compared to the quenched weight without superscript. We have for the partition function eq. (2) with
masses

This result simply follows from choosing yj = −m2

polynomials. It is clear that if some of the masses become zero, say L out of Nf , from looking at eq. (2) for
β = 2 without further calculation this leads to the shift ν → ν +L in remaining determinant of size Nf −L. This
property is called ﬂavour-topology duality. In the case when all masses are degenerate, mf = m ∀f , l’Hopital’s
rule eventually leads to [23]

In the ﬁrst step after inserting eq. (29) we have included the mass dependent norms h[Nf ]
N−1 into the massive
partition function in the denominator being given by the product of its norms times N !, increasing the average
from N − 1 to N . In the ﬁnal result in the second line we have already taken out all signs and factorials from the
two determinants and cancelled them partly. Also the ratio of the two Vandermonde determinants, one of which
containing the arguments x and y has been simpliﬁed using the deﬁnition (4). The kernel eq. (44) determines
all k-point eigenvalue correlation functions from eq. (7) including their mass dependence.
In particular for
x = y we obtain the spectral density with Nf masses:

Let us now turn to the gap probabilities and distribution of smallest eigenvalues, starting with E0(s) from
eq. (10). The following Andr´eiev integral identity (cf. Borodin’s lectures) can be used to get a ﬁrst expression:

In the second line we have replaced the expectation value of a single characteristic polynomial eq. (25) by the
Laguerre polynomial eq. (21) and ﬁxed the normalisation by the requirement E0(s = 0) = 1. The quenched
gap probability (Nf = 0) with arbitrary ν can be computed from the massive partition functions eq. (42) at
complete degeneracy.

trick can be used. First consider only the integrals(cid:82) ∞
xj = yj + s, and perform the remaining integrals (cid:82) s

The smallest eigenvalue distribution p1(s) easily follows for the examples we have just given by diﬀerentiation
of the gap probability, see eq. (12). For higher gap probabilities and for computing pk(s) directly the same
s dx in the deﬁnitions (10) and (11). Then do the shift
0 dx over the obtained expectation value of characteristic

polynomials in the end. We refer to [30] for more details.

Let us now brieﬂy comment on β = 1, 4, mainly because of recent developments and open questions in
these symmetry classes. We begin with β = 1. Here the the eﬀective topological charge is νeff = 1 to satisfy
0 = (νeff − 1)/2 in eq. (50). The additional mass terms originating from the shift by s in eq. (50) appear with
multiplicity (ν − 1)/2:

(55)

for arbitrary N . It agrees with the result for β = 2 at ν = 0, eq. (52). For general odd ν the gap probabilities
have been computed and we refer to [30] for results. However, for ν = 2l even we obtain a half integer number
l− 1/2 of additional mass terms. This leads to the question of calculating expectation values including products
of square roots of characteristic polynomials in eq. (54). In [31] the expectation values needed to determine
E0(s) for arbitrary even ν = 2l and general Nf have been computed for the chGOE, answering at least the
question for the gap probability. The cases ν = 0 [32] and ν = 2 [33] were previously known from diﬀerent
considerations. Namely in [34] a recursive construction was made for the smallest eigenvalue for β = 1 valid for
all ν. However, in this approach the Pfaﬃan structure appearing for ν ≥ 4 is not at all apparent.

Independently in [35] the question about expectation values of square roots of determinants has been asked
and answered for special cases for the GOE in the context of scattering in chaotic quantum systems. It is an open
problem if the most general expectation value of such products (or ratios) of square roots has a determinantal
or Pfaﬃan structure as in eq. (33).
Let us turn to β = 4. The eﬀective topological charge we obtain is νeff = −1/2 to satisfy 0 = 2νeff + 1 in eq.
(50). The fact that it is not integer does not pose a problem as the index of the generalised Laguerre polynomials

12

self-dual quaternion valued N × N matrix H ∈ H always come in pairs, implying det[x − H] =(cid:81)N

eq. (21) in terms of which we have expressed expectation values of characteristic polynomials can be chosen
accordingly. The more sever problem is the following. Due to Kramer’s degeneracy the eigenvalues xj of a
j=1(x − xj)2.
Consequently the mass terms generated from eq. (5) always occur with an even power Nf of two-fold degenerate
masses in eq. (2). In contrast in eq. (50) we always need to evaluate an odd number of powers (yj + s)2ν+3.
Thus as for β = 1 with even ν we need to evaluate square roots of determinants in order to compute the gap
probability for β = 4. This is an open problem so far and only the gap probability (and smallest eigenvalue
distribution) with ν = 0 is known explicitly [32]. A Taylor series expansion exists though for ν > 0, following
from group integrals of Kaneko-type [36].

2.4 The large-N limit at the hard edge

After having exhaustively presented the solution of the eigenvalues model eq. (2) and its correlation functions
for a ﬁnite number of eigenvalues N at arbitrary Nf for β = 2, we will now turn to the large-N limit. As
it is true in general in RMT one has to distinguish between diﬀerent large-N scaling regimes. The global
spectral statistics, which includes the global macroscopic density given by the semi-circle law for the GUE, or
the Marchenko-Pastur law for the chGUE, see Figure 2, is concerned with correlations between eigenvalues that
have many other eigenvalues (in fact a ﬁnite fraction of all) in between them. For a discussion of this large-N
limit alternative techniques are available such as loop-equations, and we refer to [37] for a standard reference
where all correlation functions including subleading contributions are computed recursively for β = 2. In this
limit the ﬂuctuations of the eigenvalues on a local scale (of a few eigenvalues) are averaged out, and typically
expectation values factorise.

In contrast when magnifying the ﬂuctuations among eigenvalues at a distance of 1/N δ one speaks of mi-
croscopic limits. The value of δ and the form of the limiting kernel depend on the location in the spectrum,
see Figure 2. At the so-called soft edge of the Marchenko-Pastur law one ﬁnds the Airy-kernel, whereas in the
bulk of the spectrum the sine-kernel is found, see e.g. [16]. Here we will be interested in the eigenvalues in the
vicinity of the origin presenting a hard edge with δ = 1/2 and the limiting kernel to be computed below is the
Bessel-kernel. Why this limit is relevant for the application of RMT to QCD has been indicated already in the
introduction after eq. (1).

of W W † to Dirac operator eigenvalues yj = ±√

As a further consequence of this comparison to QCD we will change variables from Wishart eigenvalues xj
xj (more details follow in Section 3). Looking at the partition
function eq. (2) the Dirac eigenvalues and masses have to be rescaled with the same power in N . Otherwise we
would immediately loose the dependence on the masses. On the RMT side the hard-edge scaling limit zooming
into the vicinity of the origin is conventionally deﬁned including factors by taking N → ∞ and yj, mf → 0,
such that the following product remains ﬁnite3

In the last subsection we have eventually expressed all quantities of interest in terms of the Laguerre polynomials
of the quenched weight. Therefore the only piece of information we need to take the asymptotic limit of all
these quantities is the well known limit [38]:

Consequently all Laguerre polynomials of positive argument turn into J-Bessel functions. Those polynomials
containing negative arguments will turn into I-Bessel functions, due to the relation Iν(z) = i−νJν(iz) for integer
ν. Note that both types of Bessel functions also appear together, see e.g. in eqs. (43) and (44). The asymptotics
of the Laguerre OP eq. (57) in fact holds for OP with respect to much more general weight functions. This
phenomenon is called universality. After ﬁrst results in [39, 40, 27] more sophisticated rigorous mathematical
methods including the Riemann-Hilbert approach were developed, see chapter 6 by A. Kuijlaars in [13] for a
detailed discussion and for references.

In the following we will give a few examples for the hard edge limit, starting with the partition function.
Looking at eq. (41) it is clear that we have to normalise it diﬀerently, such that the limit exists and gives a

Note that our conventions are chosen such that for small mass the limiting partition function behaves as

( ˜m ≈ 0) ∼ ˜mν, rather than unity. The reason for this choice will also become transparent in the next
section. For general Nf we do not spell out the normalisation constant explicitly and directly give the limiting
result for non-degenerate masses

The direct limit N → ∞ of eq. (42) (or l’Hopital’s) rule from eq. (60)) leading to a determinant of derivatives
of I-Bessel functions can be brought to this form of a Toeplitz determinant using identities for Bessel functions.
As the next step we will directly jump to the limiting kernel, the reason being two-fold. First, it is shorter to
directly construct all correlation function form the kernel, eq. (44), rather than constructing the kernel through
the massive OP’s ﬁrst. Second and more importantly, the limit of the individual OP’s does not necessarily
exist. While here in the hard edge limit this is not the case, the well-known sine- and cosine-asymptotic of the
Hermite polynomials in the bulk of the spectrum is only achieved after multiplying them with the square root
of the weight function. We obtain for the limiting kernel from eq. (44), after appropriately normalising and
changing to Dirac eigenvalues,

At Nf = 0 it reduces to the standard Bessel-kernel:

(63)

Here we have given two equivalent forms of the same kernel using an identity [38] for J-Bessel functions,
2νJν(x) = x(Jν+1(x) + Jν−1(x)). Following eq. (7) we have already included the weight function into the
limiting kernel above. While the exponential part cancels out due to exp[−x = −˜y2/4N ] → 1 the remaining
ν-dependent part is contributing. We can thus immediately write down an example, the quenched microscopic
density

(cid:0)Jν(˜x)2 − Jν−1(˜x)Jν+1(˜x)(cid:1) .

We have omitted here the ν delta-functions of the exact zero-eigenvalues. They will enter the discussion later
in Subsection 4.1 where they can be seen. The density is plotted in Figure 3 for ν = 0 and 1.
The next step is to obtain the limiting distribution of the smallest eigenvalue. Because we change from
Wishart to Dirac eigenvalues s → x2, we obtain the following scaling limit for the examples of the gap probability
(52) and (53) at Nf = 0, using the same scaling for the Dirac eigenvalues as in eq. (56):

ν = 0 :

ν = 1 :

lim
N → ∞

E0(s = x2 = ˜x2/(4N )) = E0(˜x) = e−˜x2/4 ,

E0(s = x2 = ˜x2/(4N )) = E0(˜x) = e−˜x2/4I0(˜x) .

(65)

(66)

Note that the extra power of N from the shift (50) leads to the fact that here the exponential is not vanishing.
The liming quenched gap probability for general ν follows from the completely degenerate massive partition
function (61):

E0(˜x) = e−˜x2/4 det
1≤i,j≤ν

[Ii−j(˜x)] .

(67)

The limiting distribution of the corresponding smallest Dirac eigenvalue follows according to eq. (12), after
changing to Dirac eigenvalues:

ν = 0 : P1(˜x) = −∂˜xE0(˜x) =
ν = 1 : P1(˜x) = −∂˜xE0(˜x) =

e−˜x2/4 ,

where for the last step we have used an identity for Bessel functions. The last two formuas are compared to the
quenched Bessel density eq. (64) in Figure 3. It turns out that for general ν the derivative of the determinant in
eq. (67) can be written again as a determinant, following the ideas sketched after eq. (53) that the distribution
of the smallest eigenvalue can itself be expressed in term of an expectation value of characteristic polynomials,

Figure 3: The quenched microscopic spectral density from eq. (64) and the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue
for ν = 0 (left) and ν = 1 (right) using eqs. (68) and (69). It can be nicely seen how the distribution of the
smallest eigenvalues follows the microscopic density for small ˜x. The local maxima of the density further to the
right mark the locations of the second, third etc. eigenvalues, cf. [47]. The limiting value lim˜x→∞ ρs(˜x) = 1/π
that equals the macroscopic density at the origin is marked as a horizontal line.

It should be mentioned that alternative representations exist for the gap probability eq. (70) that are based
on Fredholm determinant analysis [41]. They are given in terms of an exponential of an integral of the solution

15

of a Painlev´e V equation, which is valid for any real ν > −1. For integer values of ν this expression reduces to
the simpler forms that we have given here. Furthermore, in [42, 43] representations in terms of hypergeometric
functions with matrix argument were given that are valid for all β > 0. In [33] the equivalence to the above
expressions for β = 2 was proved.

The distributions that we have computed so far, as for example the density and smallest eigenvalue in Figure
3 have been extensively compared to numerical solutions from lattice QCD. For example the quenched densitiy
in Figure 3 was matched with QCD in [44, 45], whereas the quenched distribution of the smallest eigenvalue also
given in Figure 3 was compared in [46] to QCD for diﬀerent values of ν (and also to other QFTs corresponding
to β = 1, 4). A matching to unquenched results for the smallest eigenvalues can be found in [47], and we refer
to [8, 48] for a more exhaustive discussion of the lattice results.

3 Symmetries of QCD and its relation to RMT

Apart from giving non-specialists some idea about the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) we will
have to answer three major questions in this section:

• How is the Dirac operator deﬁned the spectrum of which can be described by RMT?
• What are the global symmetries of QCD that determine the RMT to be used?
• What is the limit that leads from QCD to this RMT?

Let us give ﬁrst short answers that also indicate how this section will be organised. The eigenvalues of
the QCD Dirac operator will be partly described by RMT, actually only its smallest eigenvalues, and we will
introduce this operator ﬁrst in Subsection 3.1. The anti-Hermiticity properties of the Dirac operator and the
concept of chiral symmetry will allow us to introduce some formal aspects and the deﬁnition of the QCD
partition function. The breaking of chiral symmetry in Subsection 3.2 then leads us to the ﬁrst approximation
of QCD, to chiral perturbation theory that only contains the lightest excitations, the Goldstone Bosons. In a
last step in Subsection 3.3 this interacting non-linear, eﬀective QFT is simpliﬁed in the epsilon-regime, that
agrees with RMT to leading order.

In what follows it is important that we will talk about space-time coordinates (x) = ((cid:126)x, t) = (x1, x2, x3, x4)
with components xµ, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4 equipped with the Euclidean metric δµν given by the Kronecker symbol4. This
so-called Wick rotation from Minkowski to Euclidean metric is necessary for two reasons: only in this setting
does the Dirac operator have deﬁned anti-Hermiticity properties, and second only for QCD on a Euclidean
space-time lattice numerical solutions of QCD can be easily performed to which we can compare our RMT. We
use Einstein’s summation conventions meaning that Greek indices appearing twice are automatically summed
over from 1 to 4.

3.1 The Dirac operator and global symmetries of QCD

The QCD Dirac operator is a linear, matrix valued diﬀerential operator deﬁned as follows:

D/ = γµD/µ = γµ (∂µ + igsAµ(x)) = −D/

†

,

(71)

where ∂µ = ∂
∂xµ

. The γµ are the Dirac-gamma matrices in Euclidean space-time, satisfying the Cliﬀord algebra

(72)
The curly brackets denote the anti-commutator. A standard representation as 4× 4 matrices is given as follows
in terms of the Pauli matrices σk, k = 1, 2, 3:

{γµ, γν} = γµγν + γνγµ = 2δµν.

(74)

The real parameter gs in the Dirac operator is the coupling constant of the strong interactions, thus gs = 0
corresponds to the free Dirac operator without interactions. It acts on 4-vectors ψ(x) called spinors in Minkowsky
space, due to their transformation properties there which we don’t need to specify here. The real vector
potential Aµ(x) ∈ SUc(3) is an element of this Lie group for the three colours (the subscript c stands for
colour).
It is a scalar with respect to the γµ’s, just as the partial derivatives in eq. (71). The ψ(x) come
in 3 copies with colours blue b, green g and red r, and so the interacting Dirac operator acts on the full
vector Ψ(x) = (ψb(x), ψg(x), ψr(x)). For each quark ﬂavour up, down etc. we have such a vector Ψq(x) with
q = 1, 2, . . . Nf . In the standard model of elementary particle physics we have Nf = 6, but often we will keep Nf
ﬁxed as a free parameter. We could have written the Dirac operator with tensor product notation to underline
these structures, but the precise SUc(3) structure will not be crucial in the following.

We are now ready to state some important global symmetries of the Dirac operator. First, it follows from

the algebra (72) that

0 = {D/ , γ5} ⇒ D/ =

(75)
The Dirac operator is block oﬀ-diagonal also called chiral, where the symbol W still denotes a diﬀerential
operator that depends on x and Aµ. Suppose we can ﬁnd the eigenfunctions Φk(x) of the Dirac operator
labelled by k:

.

(76)
in a suitably regularised setting (e.g. a ﬁnite box). Because of the anti-Hermiticity the eigenvalues iλk ∈ iR
(75) multiplying equation (76) by γ5 leads to diﬀerent
are purely imaginary. Furthermore, because of eq.
eigenfunctions γ5Φk(x) with eigenvalues −iλk, provided that λk (cid:54)= 0. Thus the non-zero eigenvalues of the
Dirac operator come in pairs ±iλk.

D/ Φk(x) = iλkΦk(x) ,

the following, see standard textbooks on QCD for a discussion as [1]. In the second equation however we have
formally integrated out the quarks due to the following observation. For a complex N -vector v and N × N
matrix B we have

(cid:90)

d2N v exp[−v†Bv] ∼ 1

det[B]

d2N ψ exp[−ψ†Bψ] ∼ det[B] ,

(78)

whereas in the second identity we have integrated over a complex vector ψ of anticommuting variables. Inte-
gration and diﬀerentiation over such fermionic variables can be deﬁned in a precise way, and we refer to chapter
7 in [13] for details. The reason for Fermions to be represented by anti-commuting variables is that in the
canonical quantisation of free Dirac ﬁelds one has to use anti-commutators for these ﬁelds.

Comparing eq. (75) and the second line of eq. (77) with eq. (5) we already get a ﬁrst idea about the random
matrix approximation of QCD, as it was suggested initially in [6]: the Dirac operator from eq. (75) is replaced
by a constant matrix with the same block structure, W → W , and the average over the ﬁelds strength tensor is
replaced by a Gaussian average over W . We further learn in this approximation that the eigenvalues xj = λ2
k of
the Gaussian random matrix W W † correspond to the squared eigenvalues of the Dirac operator rotated to the
real line, and that the number of eigenvalues N is proportional to the dimension of the QCD Dirac operator

truncated in this way. However, as we will explain in the next subsection the precise form of the limit from
QCD to RMT was better understood later, representing a controlled approximation.

Furthermore, in the case when all masses vanish mq = 0 the action in the exponent in the ﬁrst line of eq.
(77) has an additional symmetry. Deﬁning the vector Ψ = (Ψ1, . . . ΨNf ) as well as the projections P±Ψ = ΨL/R
onto left (L) and right (R) chirality we can write the fermionic part of the action as

Nf(cid:88)

It is invariant under the global rotations ΨL(x) → ULΨL(x) with UL ∈ UL(Nf ) and likewise for R. In contrast,
even when all masses are equal, mq = m ∀q, the mass term mΨΨ = m(ΨLΨR + ΨRΨL) is only invariant under
the diagonal transformation with UL = UR. In QCD the resulting global symmetry is UL(Nf ) × UR(Nf ) =
UV (1)× UA(1)× SUL(Nf )× SUR(Nf ), with the U (1)-factors called UV (1) for vector and UA(1) for axial-vector
split oﬀ. The latter is broken through quantum eﬀects also called an anomaly, whereas the former remains
unbroken through the mass term. This leads to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking pattern in QCD:

SUL(Nf ) × SUR(Nf ) → SU (Nf ) .

(80)

3.2 Chiral symmetry breaking and chiral perturbation theory

In this subsection we will describe the ﬁrst step of simplifying QCD to what is called its low-energy eﬀective
theory. We begin with the following observation. It is found that the QCD vacuum |0(cid:105), the ground state with
the lowest energy, breaks chiral symmetry spontaneously, in precisely the same way as the theory with equal
masses in eq. (80) breaks it explicitly:

Σ = |(cid:104)0|ΨΨ|0(cid:105)| = |(cid:104)0|ΨLΨR + ΨRΨL|0(cid:105)| (cid:54)= 0 .

(81)

The parameter Σ is called the chiral condensate and it is the order parameter for the spontaneous breaking of
the chiral symmetry (80). It turns out that for QCD the low energy phase with non-vanishing Σ (cid:54)= 0 coincides
with the phase5 where the quarks and the gluons, the carriers of the strong interaction represented by Aµ, are
conﬁned to colourless objects, see the phase diagram in Figure 1. In the phase with Σ (cid:54)= 0 we need a lattice
QCD or other eﬀective ﬁeld theory description (such as RMT) because a perturbative expansion in the coupling
constant gs will not work here, because the coupling is large.

An important consequence was drawn by Banks and Casher [5], relating the global continuum density ρD/(λ)

of the Dirac operator eigenvalues in eq. (76) at the origin, suitably regularised in a ﬁnite volume V , to Σ:

ρD/(λ ≈ 0) =

ΣV + |λ|

1
π

Σ2
32π2F 4

π Nf

(N 2

f − 4) + o(λ) .

(82)

Here we added the second order term to eq. (1) derived by Stern and Smilga [49], containing the pion decay
constant Fπ as an additional parameter. The ﬁrst term leads to the following interpretation: at the origin the
global density is constant, and thus the average distance between eigenvalues there is λk ∼ 1/V . This is very
diﬀerent from free particles in a box where λ ∼ 1/L with V = L4 in 4 Euclidean dimensions. One can thus say
that the smallest Dirac operator eigenvalues make an important contribution to build up the chiral condensate
Σ (cid:54)= 0, by piling up very closely spaced at the origin. We are thus lead to deﬁne rescaled, dimensionless
eigenvalues and masses, as they appear on the same footing inside the determinant in eq. (77), together with a
rescaled microscopic density of the Dirac operator ρs(ˆλ):

ˆλk = ΣV λk, ˆmf = ΣV mf , ρs(ˆλ) = lim
V →∞

1
ΣV

ρD/(ˆλ/ΣV ) .

(83)

This is called the microscopic limit of QCD. It has to be compared e.g. to eq. (64) for Nf = 0, after idensifying
rescaled RMT eigenvalues and masses from eq. (56), ˜mf = ˆmf .

The breaking of a global continuous symmetry in any theory leads to Goldstone Bosons. It can be visualised
by analogy in Figure 4, showing the classical potential of a particle before (left) and after symmetry breaking

5In toy models of QCD e.g. with two colours SUc(2) or diﬀerent representations this is not necessarily the case.

(right). In the left picture with a convex potential any excitation to make a particle move in the potential costs
energy. After symmetry breaking the curvature at the origin has changed. Consequently there now exists the
possibility to exited a mode in angular direction along the valley of the potential, without costing potential
energy. Modes that do need energy to be excited still exist in radial direction.

Figure 4: The potentials V±(x, y) = ±2(x2 + y2) + 1.5(x2 + y2)2 before symmetry breaking (V+, left) and after
breaking (V−, right), obtained simply by switching the sign of the quadratic term.

In our analogy particles that require energy to be excited correspond to massive particles. Consequently after
symmetry breaking there appear massless modes - the Goldstone Bosons - and modes that remain massive. If in
QCD chiral symmetry was an exact symmetry we would expect to observe exactly massless Goldstone Bosons
in the phase with broken symmetry. However, it is only an approximate symmetry due to mq (cid:54)= 0, leading to
approximately massless Bosons after symmetry breaking. These are the 3 light pions observed in nature, π±
and π0, with masses of about 135 Mev compared to the heavier non-Goldstone particles with masses of 800
-1000 Mev. Recall that in the conﬁned phase we only observe colourless bound states made from two quarks,
Mesons, which are Bosons, from three quarks, Baryons, which are Fermions, or more6. The pions are unstable
and decay mostly into a muon and its anti-neutrino for π+, the corresponding anti-particles for π−, or 2 photons
for π0.
The number of Goldstone Bosons equals the dimension of the coset SUL(Nf ) × SUR(Nf )/SU (Nf ) of the
f − 1, the dimension of SU (Nf ) in our case. To consider the pions
groups before and after breaking, which is N 2
as Goldstone Bosons thus means that we only keep the lightest quarks up and down, so that Nf = 2 in our
theory. For many purposes at low energy this is a good approximation. Sometimes also the strange quark is
included, with Nf = 3 leading to consider the 8 lightest particles as Goldstone Bosons.

If we neglect all non-Goldstone Bosons in our theory - as they will not be relevant at low enough energies -

and formally integrate them out we arrive at the low-energy eﬀective theory of the Goldstone Bosons,

in powers of U (x) and its derivatives that are invariant exist and we will come back to the question when they
contribute in the next section. For more details about chPT we refer to [4].

ChPT is an interacting, non-linear QFT. When expanding the exponential in eq. (85) in powers of πb(x)
and considering only quadratic terms we obtain the standard Lagrangian for scalar ﬁelds that leads to the
Klein-Gordon equation. From that expansion we can make the following identiﬁcation for the masses Mπ of the
pion ﬁelds πb(x), the Gell-Mann–Oakes–Renner (GOR) relation:

π = Σ(m1 + . . . + mNf ) .

The QFT in eq. (84) is not yet related to RMT, and we turn to this limit in the next subsection.

3.3 The limit to RMT: the epsilon-regime

The so-called epsilon-regime of chPT (echPT) was introduced by Gasser and Leutwyler [50] before a RMT of
QCD was constructed. Their motivation was to introduce a regime where analytic computations in chPT were
feasible, in particular to understand the mass dependence of the partition function and the role of topology. In
particular Leutwyler and Smilga later computed the partition function analytically in this regime and deduced
so-called sum rules for the Dirac operator eigenvalues [51]. Working in a ﬁnite volume V = L4 of linear size L,
the authors of [50] introduced the following scaling:

 = L−1 ⇒ V ∼ −4, ∂µ ∼ , πb(x) ∼  .

This scaling implies in particular

ΣV mf = O(1),

(cid:90)

d4x∂µπb(x)∂µπb(x) = O(1)

(87)

(88)

where the former follows from the microscopic scaling limit of the Banks-Casher relation (83), and the latter
ensures that the kinetic term of the LO action is dimensionless. The physical interpretation of the epsilon-regime
follows from the scaling of the pion mass, which is implied from multiplying the GOR relation eq. (86) with
V . It has to hold that Mπ ∼ L−2, such that both sides are of the order O(1). In other words, the Compton
wavelength of the pion ﬁelds is much larger than the size of the box:

M−1

π ∼ L2 (cid:29) L ,

(89)

which is clearly an unphysical regime. Normally one would consider this to be undesirable, because in order to
observe physical, propagating pions one would choose a scaling such that the pions do ﬁt into the box V , with
π < L. In the so-called p-regime both momenta and pion mass are scaled in the same way, ∂µ, Mπ ∼ , where
M−1
such an inequality can be satisﬁed. We will come back to this issue very brieﬂy below. In the epsilon-regime

(90)
Here the propagating modes πb(x) completely factorise from the zero-modes U0 and contribute to the partition
function as a free Gaussian ﬁeld theory - which is just a constant factor. The reason that we do not expand in
the constant modes of the pions as well, but keep them as a full matrix U0 as in eq. (85) is that their quantum
ﬂuctuations are of O(1) = V /M 2
π, see [9] for a more detailed discussion. All higher order terms including those
not given in the chiral Lagrangian (84) are subleading in this limit. It is in this limit that the mass-dependence
of the limiting partition function eq. (90) and of RMT agree, and in fact also all Dirac operator eigenvalue
correlation functions. Before we make this statement more precise let us add further comments. First, it is not
only possible to make analytical computations in the epsilon-regime, but also to compare them to lattice QCD.
On the lattice the simulation parameters can be freely chosen, such that the epsilon-regime is reached and a
quantitative comparison is possible. Second, it is possible to compute so-called one or higher loop corrections
(90). For example writing down the O(2) term
to the partition function (and correlation functions) eq.
explicitly, expanding the exponential and using Wick’s theorem with the ﬁnite volume propagator corresponds

20

to computing the one-loop corrections. Third, one may perform also perturbative computations in the physical
p-regime, or even chose an extrapolation between the two regimes, cf. [52, 9] for a discussion and references.

Let us now make the map between RMT and echPT more precise. For that purpose it is convenient
to introduce an extra term in the QCD Lagrangian, the so-called theta-vacuum term containing the dual
ﬁeld strength tensor ˜Fρσ ∼ ερσµνF µν. It is deﬁned using the totally antisymmetric epsilon-tensor ερσµν in 4
dimensions. The extra term reads in appropriate normalisation:

− iθ

d4xTr ˜FρσFρσ = −iνθ .

(91)

It is a topological term, and here ν is the number of left handed (L) minus right handed (R) zero modes of
the Dirac operator eq. (71) - which so far has not made an appearance in this section about QCD. Due to the
Atiah-Singer index theorem ν is equal to the winding number of the gauge ﬁelds Aµ which is also a topological
quantity. In the partition function eq. (77) we have thus implicitly summed over all the topologies, which can
now be written as follows:

Z QCD(θ) =

e−iνθZ QCD

ν

.

(92)

Here Z QCD

ν

denotes the QCD partition function at ﬁxed topology. Inverting this equation it can be written as

What is the advantage? In RMT in the previous section we always had a ﬁxed ν ∈ N - to which we should now
compare for non-negative values7. Furthermore, the unitary group integral over SU (Nf ) that we found in the
epsilon-regime eq. (90) can now be promoted to an integral over the full unitary group, according to

In the last equality with the limiting RMT partition function from eq. (60) we have identiﬁed rescaled random

normalised Haar measure of the unitary group U (Nf ) in eq. (96) goes back to [53], see also [54] and [28] for
our normalisation. A concise derivation in terms of group characters was presented in [28]. In the simplest case

It agrees with eq. (61) from RMT, after appropriately normalising. We observe that both for degenerate and
non-degenerate masses the partition functions with Nf ﬂavours eqs. (96) and (98) are determinants of single
ﬂavour partition functions with Nf = 1.

The matching of the limiting RMT partition function and the group integral from the epsilon-regime of chPT
at ﬁxed topology is only part of their equivalence. In particular this matching does not imply that all Dirac
operator eigenvalue correlation functions agree. For example at Nf = 1 the echPT partition function agrees for
all three symmetry classes β = 1, 2, 4 [55], while their densities diﬀer. At ﬁrst sight it is not clear how to access
the Dirac operator spectrum, once we have moved from the quarks to the Goldstone Bosons as fundamental
low energy degrees of freedom. However, looking at the alternative construction of the spectral density via the
resolvent eq. (39) helps. Consider adding an auxiliary pair of quarks with masses x and y respectively to the
QCD Lagrangian eq. (77). If we arrange for the second quark to be bosonic, we obtain the following average
with respect to the unperturbed QCD partition function, at ﬁxed topology:

(99)

with ˆM = diag( ˆm1, . . . , ˆmNf , ˆx; ˆy), in the limit of the epsilon-regime. Because of the bosonic nature of the second
auxiliary quark in the denominator the integral is now over the supergroup U (f +1|1) with the corresponding
supersymmetric trace and determinant, sTr and sdet respectively, see e.g. chapter 7 of [13]. Its evaluation and
diﬀerentiation to obtain the resolvent has to be done carefully. In [56] to where we refer for details it was shown
in this fashion that the microscopic density eq. (64) and its extension to arbitrary Nf follows from eq. (99),
thus establishing the equivalence to RMT on the level of the density. In order to know the distribution of the
smallest eigenvalues the knowledge of all density correlation functions is necessary, see eq. (49), as was pointed
out in [18]. The equivalence proof for all k-point density correlation functions was achieved in [57] by directly
matching the k-point resolvent generating functions with 2k additional ratios of quark determinants of both
theories, using superbosonisation techniques.

A few comments regarding universality and corrections to the RMT regime are in place here. Already
the fact that two apparently diﬀerent theories as echPT and RMT yield the same Dirac operator correlation
functions is a striking result which is based on symmetries and universality.
It is thus surprising that even
when taking into account one-loop corrections to echPT the same universal correlation functions were found
in [58]. The only corrections to be made are subsumed in a modiﬁcation Σ → Σeﬀ = Σ(1 + C1/
√
V ), and
Fπ → Feﬀ = Fπ(1 + C2/
V ), where C1 and C2 are constants that depend on Nf , Fπ and the geometry of the
discretisation, see e.g.
[59, 60] for details and references. So far Fπ did not appear in eigenvalue correlation
functions, but later when including a chemical potential it will. This modiﬁcation means that the chiral
condensate (and pion decay constant) and thus the rescaled masses in eq. (95) and eigenvalues simply get
renormalised accordingly. Only two-loop corrections within echPT contain non-universal terms that lead out of
the RMT universality class [61].

√

However, even at the LO the agreement between the RMT and echPT rapidly breaks down when going to
higher energies, meaning to higher rescaled Dirac operator eigenvalues. At some point the ﬂuctuating modes
will start to contribute, and eventually also the chPT approach breaks down as contributions from full QCD
√
will appear. The scale where this happens has been called Thouless energy [62, 63] in analogy to applications
V
in condensed matter physics, to where we refer for details. The point where this happens scales with 1/
and F 2
π . Beyond this scale one sees a rise of the global spectral density as in eq. (82), away from the RMT
prediction. The scaling of the Thouless energy has been conﬁrmed from lattice data in a diﬀerent theory, in
QFT with two colours [64]. For the same theory deep in the bulk regime the local statistics was seen to agree
again with RMT bulk statistics of the GSE [65], being in the β = 4 symmetry class.

22

Here we have already mentioned one of the two diﬀerent symmetry classes corresponding to β = 1 and 4 in
eq. (2). They are also relevant but for diﬀerent QFTs other than QCD, e.g. with only two colours. These have
chiral symmetry patters diﬀerent from eq. (80) and we refer to [8] for a detailed discussion. The matching with
the 3 chiral RMTs in eq. (2) was initially proposed in [17]. While the agreement with lattice simulations of
the respective theories (cf. [48]) leave little doubt that these RMT are equivalent to the epsilon-regime of the
corresponding chPT, such an equivalence has not been established even on the level of the partition function
for general Nf . This is due to the more complicated structure of the corresponding group integral, see however
[55] and [66] for a discussion.

Let us brieﬂy comment also on the inﬂuence of the dimension. In 3 space-time dimensions there is no chiral
symmetry, and the RMT for QCD is given by the GUE instead [67], including mass terms. In 2 dimensions
which again has chiral symmetry the classiﬁcation is much richer, and we refer to [68] for details. This makes
contact with the symmetry classiﬁcation of topological insulators [69] and the so-called Bott-periodicity in any
dimension.

4 Recent developments

In this section we will cover some recent developments in the application of RMT to QCD, where the detailed
dependence of the partition function and Dirac operator eigenvalue correlation functions on ﬁnite lattice spacing
a or chemical potential µ are computed. In the ﬁrst Subsection 4.1 we will study the inﬂuence of a ﬁnite space-
time lattice on the spectrum as it is expected to be seen in numerical simulation of QCD on a ﬁnite lattice far
enough from the continuum. The corresponding RMT and eﬀective ﬁeld theory that we will consider go under
the name of Wilson (W)RMT as introduced in [70], and Wilson (W)chPT, see [71] for a standard reference. We
will only sketch the ideas beginning with the symmetries and WchPT, and then write down the joint density
of eigenvalues of the Hermitian Wilson Dirac operator. Its solution and its non-Hermitian part will be referred
to the literature.

The addition of a chemical potential term for the quarks to the Dirac operator renders its eigenvalues
complex. The solution of the corresponding RMT using OP in the complex plane is sketched in the second
Subsection 4.2 where we will give some details. The ﬁrst RMT of this application was already introduced by
Stephanov in 1996 [75] to explain the diﬀerence between the quenched and unquenched theory. The development
of the corresponding theory of OP in the complex plane started later in [76] and [77]. It is already partly covered
in the Les Houches lecture notes from 2005 [10], for a slightly more recent review on RMT of QCD with chemical
potential see [11]. Here we will comment on some recent developments relating to products of random matrices,
see [78] for a detailed review (and the lectures of Y. Tourigny in a diﬀerent direction).

4.1 RMT and QCD at ﬁnite lattice spacing - the Wilson Dirac operator

The discretisation of derivatives on a space-time lattice is not a unique procedure, which also applies to the
Dirac operator in eq.
(71). We would thus ﬁrst like to motivate why in this subsection we will study the
modiﬁcation proposed by Wilson, the Wilson Dirac operator

DW = D/ + a∆ (cid:54)= −D

†
W ,

(100)

which is no longer anti-Hermitian. Here a is the lattice spacing and ∆ denotes the Laplace operator which is
Hermitian. Of course both operators still have to be discretised. We cannot possibly give justice to the vast
literature on this subject and will only focus on aspects relevant for the application of RMT. The reason why
Wilson proposed to add the Laplacian is the so-called doubler problem.
In the continuum with a = 0 the
relativistic energy-momentum relation for a particle with mass M , energy E, and 4-momentum kµ reads

E2 − M 2 =

k2
µ .

(101)

Here we have spelled out the sum explicitly. Particles satisfying this relation are called on-shell (on the energy
shell). After standard discretisation this relation becomes

E2 − M 2 =

sin(kµa)2

a , k2, k3, k4), (k1, k2 − π

which in the limit a → 0 leads back to eq. (101). In contrast to the continuum relation, here with any kµ
satisfying this equation also (k1 − π
a , k3, k4) etc. fulﬁl eq. (102). In total we have 24 = 16
possibilities to add −π/a to the components of kµ, which all correspond to the same on-shell particle. This is
the doubler problem. Wilson’s modiﬁcation to add the Laplacian to the Dirac operator amounts to adding the
term γµ sin(kµa) to the right hand side of eq. (102). In the limit a → 0 this makes the extra 15 particles heavy
and thus removes the doublers. The modiﬁcation comes with a prices, as the Laplacian explicitly break chiral
symmetry. We will not discuss other possibilities here, for example in [79] for a RMT of the so-called staggered
Dirac operator, but rather stick to Wilson’s choice. Despite the non-Hermiticity of DW eq. (100) it satisﬁes
the so-called γ5-Hermiticity:

†
W = −D/ + a∆ = γ5DW γ5 .
D

(103)

Here we have simply used that (γ5)2 = I4 and the anti-commutator from eq. (75). Consequently one can deﬁne
the following Hermitian operator called D5

D5 = γ5(DW + m) = D

†
5 ,

(104)

where traditionally the quark mass m is added to the deﬁnition. Looking at eq. (75) for the Dirac operator
and eq. (73) for γ5 we can immediately give the chiral block structure of DW and D5:

DW =

, D5 =

+ a

.

(105)

Here A and B are Hermitian operators. Note the change in sign in the mass term in the lower right block of
D5. As previously for a = 0 this immediately leads to a good Ansatz to make for a WRMT, as it was made in
[70]. Before we turn to analyse this in some detail let us directly go to the epsilon-regime of QCD in the Wilson
formulation at ﬁxed topology, WechPT. It turns out that at LO 3 extra terms appear in the chiral Lagrangian
as was discussed in [71] (note the diﬀerent sign convention)8. They contain 3 new low energy constants (LEC)
W6, W7 and W8, and all terms are proportionally to a2:

(107)
It is no longer elementary, but after linearising the cos(θ)2 term it can be written as a Gaussian integral over
the one-ﬂavour partition function Iν( ˆm) in the continuum at shifted mass. For degenerate masses and general
Nf we can again diagonalise U0 and use Andr´eief’s integral formula, as in the derivation of eq. (98), leading to:

8One may wonder how it is possible to describe QCD in the Wilson discretisation scheme by a chiral Lagrangian in the continuum.

Close to the continuum limit this is a good approximation, see [71] for further details.

24

(106)
It is clear that this implies the scaling ˆa2 = a2V or a ∼ 2, in addition to the scaling of the quark masses with
the volume in eq. (88). Let us discuss some simpliﬁcations ﬁrst. Without ﬁxing topology in the special case
of SU (2) the term Tr(U − U†) vanishes, and the terms proportional to W8 and W6 are equivalent. In general,
in the second line of eq. (106) the 2 squares of the traces can be linearised by so-called Hubbart-Stratonovich
transformations, at the expense of 2 extra Gaussian integrals. The linearised terms can be included into a
shift of the mass for W6, and into so-called axial mass terms 1
Also for the latter term the corresponding group integral generalising eq. (96) is known, see [80]. Therefore in
the following we will set W6 = 0 = W7, having in mind that we need to perform 2 extra integrals for the full
partition function (106) for non-zero values of these LECs.

Once again it is given by the determinant of Nf = 1 ﬂavour partition functions. In order to determine the
spectral density of D5 or DW one then has to introduce additional auxiliary quark pairs as described in eq. (99)
(or use replicas). Prior to the RMT calculation this was done for the spectral density from WechPT in [70, 72],
for both D5 or DW .

Let us now turn to the RMT side as introduced in [70]. For simplicity we will only consider the Hermitian
operator D5, for the discussion of the complex eigenvalue spectrum of DW we refer to [72] and to [73] for
its complete solution. Actually two slightly diﬀerent RMT have been proposed, which have turned out to be
equivalent on the level of jpdf. In [70] the partition function (5) was generalised using eq. (105) in an obvious
way, by adding two Hermitian Gaussian matrices A and B of dimensions N and N + ν, respectively:

In [74] the following modiﬁcation was made: rather than adding a block-diagonal Hermitian matrix to D5 as the
last term in eq. (105), a full Hermitian matrix H was added to it, D5 = γ5(D/ + m) + H, ﬁlling the oﬀ-diagonal
blocks with a rectangular complex matrix Ω (and trivially changing the sign of B → −B):

The diﬀerent rescaling of the variances with a was made in [74] to underline that on the level of RMT this
corresponds to a two-matrix model that interpolates between the chGUE and the GUE, in the limits a → 0
and a → 1, respectively. It was shown in [70, 72] and [74] that in the limit N → ∞, identifying ˆa2
8 = a2N/4 in
addition to the rescaled mass terms the two RMT partition functions and eq. (106) with W6 = W7 = 0 agree:

(111)

As we have said before the presence of the W6- and W7-terms can be achieved by 2 extra Gaussian integrals,
see [72]. It is quite remarkable that RMT allows to include such a detailed structure of WchPT. The fact that
we have ”only” considered RMTs for D5 does not aﬀect the equivalence argument of the partition functions.
Because of eq. (104) and det[γ5] = 1 the partition functions of DW and D5 agree.

Let us just state the jpdf of the eigenvalues dj of D5 for degenerate masses without derivation, see [74] and

This jpdf has two new features. First, there appears a Vandermonde times a Pfaﬃan (Pf) deﬁned as Pf[A] =

m

This is quite common for such interpolating two-matrix models, see [81] for classical works regarding the GUE-
GOE and the GUE-GSE transitions. Second, and most importantly the solution for the correlation functions
involves both skew OP and OP at the same time, where the OP are Hermite polynomials of a GUE of size

25

(113)

ν × ν. We refer to [73] for details, in particular that this sub-structure of a ﬁnite size GUE remains valid in the
large-N limit. In [74] where only the cases ν = 0 and 1 were solved this structure was not observed, because
only Hermite polynomials of degree 0 and 1 occur.

Instead of giving any further details of the solution of WRMT we show plots in Figure 5 below for the
limiting quenched microscopic density ρD5
s (˜x) of D5 for ν = 0, 1, illustrating the eﬀect of rescaled ﬁnite lattice
spacing ˆa. In order to compare to the results from the chGUE in Figure 3 let us ﬁrst discuss the diﬀerence
between D5 and D/ at a = 0, where D5 = γ5(D/ + m), see eqs. (100) and (104). The rotation with γ5 merely
makes the Dirac operator Hermitian rather than anti-Hermitian, which corresponds to rotating the eigenvalues
from the imaginary to the real axis (as we had already done in writing the jpdf in eq. (2) of real eigenvalues).
The shift by γ5m however introduces a gap such that there are no eigenvalues of D5 in [−m, m]. Furthermore,
the ν exact zero eigenvalues which are not shown in Figure 3 get moved away from the origin to one of the
edges of this gap, which in our convention is at −m. Therefore we now have to give the density on R instead
of R+, and it holds for Nf = 0:
Θ(˜x − ˜m)

(114)
The eﬀect of ˆa8 > 0 is both to broaden the ν delta-functions and to eventually ﬁll the gap [− ˆm, ˆm]. Because
eigenvalues repel each other the ν zero-modes will now spread, and form approximately a GUE of ﬁnite size ν,
see [72] for a further discussion. In order to make the comparison more transparent let us also choose ˆm = 0, so
that we can plot the density on R+ only, as is shown in Figure 5. The eﬀect of ˆa8 > 0 is particularly striking
on the zero-modes.

Figure 5: The quenched microscopic spectral density ρD5
s (˜x) for ν = 0 (left) and ν = 1 (right) as a function of
ˆa8, taken from [74]. Because of choosing ˆm = 0 it is still symmetric around the origin. For ˆa8 = 0 we are back to
the microscopic density of Bessel functions as in Figure 3, whereas for ˆa8 = 0.1 (blue) and 0.25 (red) the density
starts to spread into the region around the origin. For ν = 1 the delta-function of the one zero-eigenvalue is
broadened by increasing ˆa8 - which is why this is plotted on a diﬀerent scale compared to ν = 0. At these small
values of ˆa8 the eﬀect on the density is remarkably localised to the origin. Only in the limit ˆa8 → ∞ we will
arrive at the microscopic density of the GUE [74] which is completely ﬂat (and normalised to 1/π here).

The density of the Hermitian Wilson Dirac operator D5 has been compared to quenched lattice simulations
in [82, 83]. Because this involves multi-parameter ﬁts several quantities have been proposed that are simple
to measure [84]. A comparison to unquenched data remains a diﬃcult question, see however [85]. The RMT
approach presented here has also lead to insights about the sign and constraints amongst the LECs W6,7,8
that were previously controversial [72, 86]. When the lattice artefact become very strong additional unphysical
phases appear, and the possibility to access these as a function of the LEC and quark content Nf was clariﬁed
in [87]. The derivation of all k-point correlation functions including Nf (cid:54)= 0 based on WechPT has been pushed
forward in [88], leading to alternative representations compared to the OP approach [73]. For the density of
D5 in the p-regime see [89]. The computation of individual eigenvalue distribution is not known beyond the
expansion of the Fredholm expansion proposed in [90].

4.2 RMT and QCD with chemical potential

In this subsection we will study the inﬂuence of a chemical potential µ on the Dirac operator spectrum. We
will ﬁrst give its global symmetry in QCD, then construct the RMT and at the end link to the epsilon-regime
of the corresponding chiral Lagrangian. The addition of a chemical potential µq for each quark ﬂavour to the
QCD action in eq. (77) amounts to add the terms µqΨq †(x)Ψq(x) = Ψ
(x)µqγ4Ψq(x). In classical statistical
mechanics the addition of a chemical potential allows the number of the corresponding particles to ﬂuctuate.
Here we will add the same chemical potential µq = µ to all ﬂavours (which makes it the Baryon chemical
potential). In analogy to eq. (75) the global symmetry of the Dirac operator plus µγ4 changes to

and thus becomes complex non-Hermitian.
chemical potential µ → iµ it is still anti-Hermitian. Because the operator remains chiral

0 = {D/(µ), γ5} , D/(µ)Φk(x) = izkΦk(x) ,

(116)
the complex eigenvalues continue to come in pairs ±izk, using the same argument as after eq. (76). The fact
that the spectrum of the Dirac operator with chemical potential is complex (and thus the QCD action too) has
severe repercussions for lattice QCD. Because the action can no longer be interpreted as a probability weight,
the standard method on the lattice, weighting a given conﬁguration by its action breaks down. Several methods
have been invented to circumvent this so-called sign problem, and we refer to [91] for a review. In contrast the
RMT for QCD with chemical potential remains analytically solvable with OP in the complex plane, as we will
see.
In [75] a RMT was constructed where W was replaced by a complex Gaussian random matrix W1, as in
eq. (5) for β = 2 compared to (75). While this RMT was very useful to illuminate the diﬀerence between
Nf = 0 and Nf > 0 which is more dramatic than for µ = 0, this model was not analytically tractable with
OP at ﬁnite-N . Therefore Osborn [77] introduced a two-matrix model where µ is multiplied by a second
random matrix W2, see eq. (117) below, implying that the chemical potential term is not diagonal in that basis.
While at ﬁrst sight more complicated this model turns out to be exactly solvable using OP in the complex
plane, as we will demonstrate. A further equivalent representation was chosen in [92], multiplying W1,2 by
exp[∓µ] instead. This parametrisation allowed to understand, why the sign problem in the numerical solution
of this RMT for QCD with µ (cid:54)= 0 can be circumvented [93]. Prior to introducing an RMT with µ as in eq.
(115) a similar model was introduced [94] describing the eﬀect of temperature T . Such a model can only be
solved using the supersymmetric method, see [95], with the eﬀect of renormalising Σ → Σ(T ) to be temperature
dependent, keeping the correlation functions otherwise unchanged. A further modiﬁcation of Stephanov’s model
by including both parameters µ → µ + iπT in eq. (115) was very successful as a schematic model for the phase
diagram of QCD [96], predicting the qualitative features depicted in Figure 1.

det[z − D/(µ)] = det[z2 − X1X2] ,

(118)

27

reveals that we are after the complex eigenvalues9 of the product of the two correlated matrices Y = X1X2. As
in eq. (5) we could have allowed for real or quaternion valued matrix elements with β = 1, 4. However, the joint
density of complex eigenvalues does not enjoy a closed form for all 3 β’s as in eq. (2). In particular real matrices
are special as the can have real eigenvalues and complex conjugated eigenvalues pairs as the characteristic
equation (118) is real. For the solution of the respective RMTs see [98] and [99], respectively.
The parametrisation of a generic complex non-Hermitian matrix Y in terms of its complex eigenvalues is
usually done using the Schur decomposition Y = U (Z + T )U†, where U ∈ U (N ) is unitary, Z = diag(z1, . . . , zN )
contains the complex eigenvalues, and T is a strictly upper triangular complex matrix (it can be chosen to be
strictly lower triangular instead). For two matrices however, in order to compute the Jacobian we have to use
the following generalised Schur decomposition [100]

X1 = U (Z1 + R)V , X2 = V †(Z2 + S)U† ⇒ Y = X1X2 = U (Z + T )U† ,

(119)
with Z = Z1Z2 and T = RZ2 + Z1S + RS. Here U, V ∈ U (N ) are unitary, Z1, Z2 are diagonal matrices with
complex entries (which are not the complex eigenvalues of X1 and X2), and R, S are strictly upper triangular.
The complex eigenvalues of the product matrix Y are thus given by the elements of the diagonal matrix Z. Let
us directly give the result for the joint density from [77] (see [101] for an alternative derivation):

Note that in view of eq. (118) we should later take the square root of the eigenvalues zj of Y = X1X2 to change
to Dirac operator eigenvalues. In the complex plane this is not unique and without loss of generality one can
then restrict to the half-plane, also in view of the ± pairs of Dirac eigenvalues. Before we discuss the properties
of eq. (120) and its correlation functions let us try to understand why the Jacobian of the transformation (119)
does not only include the modulus squared Vandermonde determinant (as in the complex Ginibre ensemble, see
[14]) and the zero-modes |zj|ν, but also a modiﬁed K-Bessel function, even though we started from (coupled)
Gaussian matrices. The same phenomenon happens when looking at products of complex Gaussian random
variables z1,2, and asking for the distribution w(z) of the product random variable z = z1z2:

d2z1

d2z2 exp[−|z1|2−|z2

r2 exp[−r2−|z|2/r2] = 2πK0(2|z|) . (122)

Obviously we are dealing with the analogue of quadratic matrices here. Multiplying n ≥ 2 such random variables
(cid:19)
we obtain an (n − 1)-fold integral representation for the distribution of z now given by a Meijer G-function:

We will not discuss gap probabilities or individual eigenvalue distributions here and refer to [103]. Unlike in
the real eigenvalue case they will now depend on the choice of the geometry of the region containing k ≥ 0
eigenvalues, and only in the rotationally invariant case µ = 1 a radial ordering of eigenvalues according to their
modulus provides a natural choice.
Before we solve the RMT eq. (120) a word of caution is in order. In standard OP theory in the complex plane
only real positive weights are considered, which is only true for Nf = 0 in eq. (126). In this case Pk(z)∗ = Qk(z)
and standard techniques as Gram-Schmidt apply to construct these polynomials, see e.g. [19]. When Nf > 0 in
our case the weight is complex, and thus also a priori the partition function is as well as the Rk are. Therefore
the density no longer has a probabilistic interpretation, it has a real and imaginary part, and we refer to [104]
for a more detailed discussion.

We will ﬁrst provide the solution of the simplest quenched case with Nf = 0. Then the partition function
and general eigenvalue correlation functions including Nf mass terms can be obtained along the same lines as in
Section 2, expressing them in terms of the OP at Nf = 0. Surprisingly, despite the complicated non-Gaussian
weight function in the complex plane the OP are again given by Laguerre polynomials of complex arguments
[77] 10. The following holds, where we drop the argument µ of the parameters a > b ≥ 0 in eq. (117):

(128)
Here ν = 0, 1, . . . is an integer, and the Laguerre polynomials can be made monic as in eq. (21). The proof
we sketch follows [106] and uses induction of depth 2, for an earlier longer proof see [99]. Insert the integral
representations into the orthogonality relation (128) for ν = 0, 1,

where Γ is a contour enclosing the origin in positive direction, but not the point z = 1. Then the Gaussian
integrals of the real and imaginary parts of z = x + iy can be solved, and subsequently the integral over t
from the K-Bessel function. The orthogonality then easily follows applying the residue theorem twice. For the
induction we use the 3-step recurrence relation for the Laguerre polynomials and K-Bessel function [38], see
[106] for details. We thus have solved the quenched case as we know all correlation functions from the kernel

in terms of the quantities in eq. (128), using eq. (124). A similar solution exists [107] for the so-called elliptic
complex Ginibre ensemble of a single complex matrix W = H + iA, where the Hermitian part H = H† and
anti-Hermitian part A = A† of the matrix have diﬀerent variances that depend on a parameter. The solution
is given in term of Hermite polynomials in the complex plane and allows to interpolate between the GUE and
the complex Ginibre ensemble at maximal non-Hermiticity, where H and A have the same variance. We refer
to [107] for a detailed discussion.

Let us now turn to the unquenched solution with Nf > 0 described in great detail in [104], expressing
everything in terms of the Laguerre polynomials of the quenched solution from eq. (128). Because we follow

10A ﬁrst unsuccessful attempt with the incorrect weight (except for ν = ± 1

2 ) was made in [105].

29

the same strategy as in Subsections 2.2 and 2.3 using expectation values of characteristic polynomials we can be
very brief. The corresponding proofs for manipulating expectation values deﬁned as in eq. (24) of characteristic
polynomials and their complex conjugates can be found in [24]. In particular for the monic OP in the complex
plane satisfying eq. (127) for a weight w(z) that can be complex we have

The proof goes exactly the same way as in eq. (27), where for PL(z) we multiply the product into ∆L({z}),
increasing it to ∆L+1. For QL(u∗) we simply choose ∆L({z})∗, increasing it to ∆∗
L+1. Likewise for the kernel
we obtain

modifying the proof in eq. (30) accordingly by multiplying the ﬁrst product into ∆N ({z}), and the second
into ∆N ({z})∗. The only diﬀerence here is that in general no Christoﬀel-Darboux formula is available. This
is despite the fact that the Laguerre polynomials in our example eq. (128) still satisfy the standard 3-step
recurrence (which is not true for OP in the complex plane in general). The step in the proof of eq. (18) that
breaks down is the cancellation of the summands after multiplying eq. (130) by (z − u∗).
The most general result corresponding to eq. (33) now contains both products of K characteristic polyno-
mials and of L products of complex conjugated ones. Without loss of generality let us choose K ≥ L (K < L
can be obtained by complex conjugation), to state the result from [24]:

Here the left block of kernels inside the determinant is of size K × L. The proof is straightforward and uses
induction. Using this result we are now ready to compute the partition function eq. (120) for general Nf ≥ 0.
In the quenched case it given again by N ! times the products of the norms from eq. (128), as derived in eq.
(23). For Nf > 0 we can express it in terms of the Laguerre polynomials from eq. (128), and obtain an almost

As in eq. (41) it is given by a determinant of Laguerre polynomials of real arguments which are real. The only
diﬀerence to µ = 0 are the scale factors c = 1/(1−µ2) and the µ-dependence inside the norms hj from eq. (128).
N (z, u∗) constituting the k-point correlation functions
We will not give further details regarding the kernel K [Nf ]
in eq. (124). Following the ﬁrst line of eq. (44) it can be expressed through the quenched average of Nf + 1
characteristic polynomials times one conjugated characteristic polynomial, divided by the partition function
N (z, z∗)
from eq. (134). The spectral density with Nf masses then follows as in eq. (45), by multiplying K [Nf ]
by the weight eq. (126), see [77, 104] for more details. Clearly is is not real in general.

We will now very brieﬂy discuss the large-N limit and matching with the corresponding echPT. It turns out
that for non-Hermitian matrices that are coupled as in eq. (117) the possibility of taking such limits is much
richer than in the Hermitian (or maximally non-Hermitian) case. In addition to the standard macroscopic and
microscopic statistics a further class of limits exist, where the matrix Y = X1X2 becomes almost Hermitian,
taking the parameter µ → 0 at a rate that

are constant. Here the scaling of the complex eigenvalues (and masses) is unchanged compared to eq. (56).
This limit was ﬁrst observed in the elliptic complex Ginibre ensemble already mentioned [107] and called weakly

30

non-Hermitian [108]. This is in contrast to the limit at strong non-Hermiticity where µ ∈ (0, 1] is kept ﬁxed
and a diﬀerent scaling of z chosen. Here the statistics of the product of two independent complex matrices
with µ = 1 is found, see [104] and [103] for details. Looking at our result eq. (134) it is clear that the limiting
partition function is the same as for µ = 0, eq. (59) and is thus independent of the rescaled ˆµ. In contrast
already the limiting quenched density does depend on ˆµ. It can be easily obtained from eq. (130), replacing
the sum by an integral and using eq. (57) for the Laguerre polynomials,

It is shown in Figure 6. Here we have again changed to Dirac eigenvalues following [77]. This result was obtained
earlier using replicas and the Toda equation in [109]. For ˆµ = 0 the integral becomes elementary and matches
eq. (64).

Figure 6: The quenched microscopic spectral density from eq. (136) as a function of ˜z = ˜x + i˜y for ν = 0 (left)
and ν = 1 (right), at ˆµ = 0.1. The density of real eigenvalues from Figure 3 can still be recognised, it now
spreads into the complex plane. Because in the limit ˆµ → 0 it will become proportionally to a delta-function
δ(˜y) times the Bessel density the vertical scale is diﬀerent.

The fact that the partition function is ˆµ-independent and the density is not has been called the ”Silver blaze
problem” [110], alluding to a novel by A.C. Doyle. How can we resolve this puzzle? Let us look again at chPT,
the theory of Goldstone Bosons. Because these are Mesons they don’t carry Baryon charge and thus do not feel
the eﬀect of adding µ to the action (Mesons consist of a quark and anti-quark whereas Baryons as the proton
of 3 quarks). We can still make the chPT partition function µ-dependent by adding an integer number N∗
f of
quarks with the opposite chemical potential −µ. As discussed after eq. (115) this amounts to add complex
conjugated determinants of the Dirac operator to the action, leading to

which we can also compute using eq. (133). The corresponding limiting partion function of echPT now does

They are given by the determinant from eq. (133) of the limiting kernel and of the limiting polynomials which
are again Iν( ˆm). The corresponding group integral eq. (138) was computed independently in [109] using an
explicit parametrisation of U (Nf + N∗

f ), see [111] for the general Nf case.

What about the equivalence of RMT and echPT for the density, in other words how can we generate the
spectral density eq. (136) from a chiral Lagrangian? Although one may still deﬁne and generate the resolvent
as in eq. (39), the relation to the spectral density changes compared to eq. (40):

R1(z) =

π

∂
∂z∗ GN (z) ,

(140)

due to ∂z∗ 1/z = δ(2)(z) on C. While it is subtle to extract the non-holomorphic part from the expectation
value of the ratio of characteristic polynomials two alternative way exist to formulate the generation of a two-
dimensional delta-function. On way is to use so-called replicas which amounts to introduce k extra pairs of
complex conjugated quarks in the chiral Lagrangian. Using the relation to the Toda lattice equation the replica
limit can be made well deﬁned as was developed in [109]. The generating function for the density with k = 1,
Z [Nf +1+1∗]
on the echPT side thus depends on ˆµ, which is why the resulting density also depends on it. The
second possibility is to use supersymmetry, which will also involve pairs of complex conjugated Bosons [112],

and both methods have been shown to be equivalent [113]. In either case the silver blaze puzzle is resolved. We
would also like to mention the papers [114, 115] where averages of ratios of characteristic polynomials and their
complex conjugates were evaluated in a purely complex OP framework. The most prominent example for such

an average is the distribution of the phase of D/(µ)(cid:42) N(cid:89)

and we refer to [116] and [117] for a detailed discussion including its physical interpretation.

When trying to compare the RMT predictions to QCD Lattice simulations the presence of the chemical
potential also has a virtue, despite the sign problem: it couples to the second LEC in the chiral Lagrangian,
Fπ. Just as for µ = 0 = a a ﬁt of the density to lattice data helps to determine Σ, a two-parameter ﬁt allows to
measure Fπ in this way. Because for imaginary chemical potential iµ the Dirac operator spectrum remains real
as discussed after eq. (115), this was proposed to determine Fπ using lattice simulations [118]. There is also a
corresponding two-matrix model [119] which in the large-N with rescaled iµ as in eq. (135) becomes equal to
eq. (138), with µ2 → −µ2 (which is of course still convergent).

Turning back to real chemical potential most comparisons were done within the quenched approximation,
starting with [120], cf. [121] for the inﬂuence of topology. Despite the diﬃculty of deﬁning individual eigenvalue
distributions these were compared with in [122]. There are many issues that we have not discussed about the
application to QCD with chemical potential, apart from methods diﬀerent from the OP approach mentioned
above. This includes the diﬀerent origin of chiral symmetry breaking at µ (cid:54)= 0 that is strongly related to the
oscillatory behaviour of the unquenched density and we refer to [123] and to [124] for a review. Thanks to its
analytical solution the RMT eq. (120) has been used as a testing ground for numerical ways to solve the sign
problem. This has been successful for the RMT itself and is reported in [93].

Furthermore, the study of the singular values of the QCD Dirac operator with chemical potential has been
proposed in [125], that could also be used to analyse diﬀerent phases (not depicted in Figure 1) for larger
values of µ. Here both the lattice realisation and the RMT have many open questions, and a ﬁrst step in RMT
has been taken in [97]. Here a diﬀerent kernel is found at the origin, the so-called Meijer G-kernel [126] that

32

generalises the Bessel kernel. The mathematical question of universality in the limit of weak non-Hermiticity for
non-Gaussian RMTs is still open at the moment, despite ﬁrst heuristic attempts [127]. For a further discussion
including all known limiting kernels in this weak limit resulting from Gaussian models we refer to [128] and
references therein.

5 Summary

Let us brieﬂy summarise the lessons we have learned in these lectures. The theory of orthogonal polynomials
on the real line and in the complex plane and their properties has been extensively discussed. A particu-
lar focus was put on weights including characteristic polynomials, as this allowed us to determine the Dirac
operator spectrum of QCD including the contribution of Nf quarks ﬂavours in a random matrix approach.
Based on the global symmetries of QCD we have taken a limit to the low energy regime that eventually lead
to a random matrix description in a controlled approximation, to which corrections can be computed. Even
though this is an unphysical limit it can be compared to numerical solutions of QCD on the lattice. This leads
to a determination of the low energy constants of the theory and tests of lattice algorithms to be used then
in the physical regime. We have shown how the introduction of more details in the theory of QCD such as
the eﬀect of ﬁnite lattice spacing or of chemical potential, that makes the eigenvalues complex, modiﬁes the
spectrum. And we have mentioned several open problems relevant for RMT and for its application like the
computation of new correlation functions or the proof of universality for existing results. They hopefully con-
tribute to keep this an interesting and lively area of research for both mathematicians and theoretical physicists.
