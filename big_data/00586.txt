Galactic Spiral Arms by Swing Ampliﬁcation

ABSTRACT

Based on the swing ampliﬁcation model of Julian and Toomre (1966), we investi-
gate the formation and structure of stellar spirals in disk galaxies. We calculate the
pitch angle, wavelengths, and ampliﬁcation factor of the most ampliﬁed mode. We also
obtain the ﬁtting formulae of these quantities as a function of the epicycle frequency
and Toomre’s Q. As the epicycle frequency increases, the pitch angle and radial wave-
length increases, while the azimuthal wavelength decreases. The pitch angle and radial
wavelength increases with Q, while the azimuthal wavelength weakly depends on Q.
The ampliﬁcation factor decreases with Q rapidly. In order to conﬁrm the swing am-
pliﬁcation model, we perform local N -body simulations. The wavelengths and pitch
angle by the swing ampliﬁcation model are in good agreement with those by N -body
simulations. The dependence of the ampliﬁcation factor on the epicycle frequency in
N -body simulations is generally consistent with that in the swing ampliﬁcation model.
Using these results, we estimate the number of spiral arms as a function of the shear
rate. The number of spiral arms increases with the shear rate if the disk to halo mass
ratio is ﬁxed.

Introduction

The origin of spiral structures in disk galaxies is one of the unsolved problems in astrophysics.
The density wave model is a classical model for spiral arm formation (Lin & Shu 1964, 1966). In
this model, the spiral arm is considered as a quasi-stationary density wave that rotates around the
galactic center with a constant pattern speed. Since the wave winds much more slowly than the
material arm, the winding problem is avoidable.

Another picture is a dynamic material wave model. In a diﬀerentially rotating disk, a leading
density pattern rotates to a trailing one due to the shear. During the rotation, the leading mode
is ampliﬁed into spiral arms due to the self-gravity if Toomre’s Q is Q = 1–2. This mechanism is

called swing ampliﬁcation (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965; Julian & Toomre 1966; Toomre 1981).
In this model, spiral arms are a superposition of many unstable waves. The spirals generated by
the swing ampliﬁcation are transient and recurrent, which are observed in N -body simulations of
multi-arm spirals (Sellwood & Carlberg 1984; Baba et al. 2009; Sellwood 2000; Fujii et al. 2011).

Julian & Toomre (1966) performed the linear analysis of the collisionless Boltzmann equation
and found the swing ampliﬁcation. If the spirals are generated by the swing ampliﬁcation in N -
body simulations, it is expected that the spirals correspond to the most ampliﬁed wave in the linear
analysis. However, Julian & Toomre (1966) did not investigate the property of the most ampliﬁed
wave in detail. Fuchs (2001) investigated the azimuthal wave number of the most ampliﬁed wave
by the liner analysis of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. However, his formula is only available
for 0.2 < Γ < 1.0, where Γ is the shear rate

where r is the galactocentric distance, Ω is the circular frequency, A is the Oort constant, and κ is
the epicycle frequency. Using this formula, Baba et al. (2013) estimated the pitch angle of spiral
arms for 0.2 < Γ < 1.0.

Observationally, it has been known that the pitch angle tends to decrease with Γ (Seigar et al.
2005, 2006). Grand et al. (2013) performed N -body simulations and investigated the pitch angle of
spiral arms and found that the galaxies with higher shear rates tend to have smaller pitch angles,
which is consistent with the observations. Michikoshi & Kokubo (2014) (hereafter referred to as
Paper I) investigated the pitch angle by local N -body simulations and the linear analysis. We
performed local N -body simulations with various Γ and found that the pitch angle decreases with
Γ. We obtained the ﬁtting formula of the pitch angle that is available for wider range than that
in Baba et al. (2013). Based on the linear theory of the swing ampliﬁcation by Julian & Toomre
(1966), we derived the pitch angle formula for large Toomre’s Q, which is almost the same as the
ﬁtting formula by N -body simulations. This formula also seems consistent with the grand-design
spirals in barred galaxies (Baba 2015). This indicates that the swing ampliﬁcation can explain
some aspects of basic physics of the spiral arm formation.

In this paper, we extend Paper I to investigate the other quantities that characterize spiral
arms and understand the swing ampliﬁcation. One of the important quantities is the ampliﬁcation
factor, which means how the wave amplitude increases during the swing from leading to trailing.
Using the Goldreich-Lynden-Bell model (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965) with the reduction factor
Toomre (1981) investigated the dependence of the ampliﬁcation factor on the azimuthal wavelength
for Γ = 1. Athanassoula (1984) and Dobbs & Baba (2014) performed the same analysis for general
Γ. However, in these works, the most ampliﬁed wave was not focused on. In Paper I, we showed that
the pitch angle of spiral arms in N -body simulations can be explained by the most ampliﬁed wave
in the linear theory. Thus, it is important to investigate the most ampliﬁed wave. The dependence
of the wavelength and ampliﬁcation factor of the most ampliﬁed wave on Γ and Q has not been

– 3 –

investigated by the linear theory in detail yet. Moreover, the property of the most ampliﬁed wave
has not been conﬁrmed by N -body simulations quantitatively.

The goal of this paper is to extend Paper I to calculate the ampliﬁcation factor and radial and
azimuthal wavelengths of the most ampliﬁed wave, which enables us to understand the structures of
spiral arms. The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 deals with the Julian-Toomre model
and gives the wavelength of the most ampliﬁed wave and the ampliﬁcation factor. In section 3, we
compare the results of the Julian-Toomre model with those by local N -body simulations. Section
4 is devoted to a summary and discussions.

2. Linear Analysis

2.1.

Integral Equation

First we brieﬂy summarize the Julian-Toomre model (Julian & Toomre 1966). We consider lo-
cal Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) whose origin revolves around the galactic center with the circular
frequency Ω. The x- and y-axes are directed along the radial and rotational directions, respectively,
and the z-axis is normal to the x-y plane.

We consider the plane wave with the radial wavelength λx and the azimuthal wavelength λy.
Because of the shear, the wave rotates from a leading wave to a trailing one. While λx changes
with time t, λy remains constant. We set t = 0 when the radial wavenumber kx = 0, that is, the
pitch angle is 90◦. Thus, the negative time t < 0 corresponds to a leading wave, and the positive
time corresponds to a trailing one. We use the non-dimensional parameter ˜λy = λy/λcr where
λcr = 4π2GΣ0/κ2 and Σ0 is the unperturbed surface density, which is the same as X in Julian &
Toomre (1966). During the rotation, the wave amplitude changes.

Julian & Toomre (1966) derived the equation for the evolution of the density amplitude from
the collisionless Boltzmann equation in the corotating frame of the wave. The time evolution of
the density D with the imposed density perturbation Dimp is described by the integral equation

D(t, κ, Q, ti, ˜λy) =Z t

and Q = σxκ/(3.36GΣ0) is Toomre’s Q and σx is the radial velocity dispersion (Toomre 1964). As
seen in Equation (2), D is a function of two disk parameters, κ and Q, and two wave parameters
ti and ˜λy. Assuming that the imposed density is described by the delta function Dimp = δ(t − ti)
and using the Simpson’s rule, we solve Equation (2) numerically.

2.2. Most Ampliﬁed Wave

The left panel of Figure 1 shows the time evolution of D with κ/Ω = √2, Q = 1, ˜ti =
−1.5π, −1.0π, −0.5π, 0, 0.5π, and ˜λy = 1. The variable ˜t is the normalized time ˜t = κt. The density
amplitude has a peak at the positive time, that is, the most ampliﬁed wave is trailing. The peak
density Dpeak depends on the initial time ˜ti = κti, but the time for Dpeak barely depends on ˜ti,
which is ˜t ≃ 5.3. Optimizing ˜ti, we can calculate the maximum amplitude with ﬁxed ˜λy. The right
panel of Figure 1 shows the dependence of Dpeak on ˜ti. The wave is most ampliﬁed with ˜ti = −4.85,
where Dpeak is 184.

More generally, Dpeak depends on ˜ti and ˜λy. Thus, by optimizing ˜ti and ˜λy we can calculate
the most ampliﬁed wave for the disk model given by κ and Q. Figure 2 shows Dpeak for various ti
and ˜λy for κ/Ω = √2 and Q = 1. The peak density has the maximum value Dmax for ˜ti = −8.2
and ˜λy = 1.9. This most ampliﬁed wave is considered as the wave observed in N -body simulation.

2.3. Fitting Formula

We investigate the pitch angle θmax, the azimuthal wavelength ˜λy,max, the radial wavelength
˜λx,max, and the ampliﬁcation factor Dmax of the most ampliﬁed wave, where ˜λx,max = λx,max/λcr
is calculated by

˜λx,max = ˜λy,max tan θmax.

(6)

Figure 3 shows the dependence of these quantities on κ/Ω with Q = 1.0, 1.4, and 1.8. We obtain
their ﬁtting formulae as a function of κ/Ω and Q.

We have already obtained the ﬁtting formula of the pitch angle in Paper I

where we neglected the weak dependence on Q considering the N -body simulation results. In this
paper, we derive a more general ﬁtting formula based on the linear theory.

The most ampliﬁed wave has the maximum amplitude at time ˜tmax. The corresponding pitch

According to Paper I, ˜tmax decreases with Q and approaches ∼ 3 for large Q. Considering these
behaviors, we assume

(10)

Using the least square ﬁt method, we obtain α = 2.095 and β = 5.30. The relative error is less
than 4.7 % for Q ≥ 1.5, while the maximum relative error is about 30 % for Q ≤ 1.4.

In practice, the range 1.5 ≤ Q ≤ 2.0 is important. For example, in Paper I, regardless of the
initial Q, Q quickly increases and becomes larger than about 1.5 due to gravitational scattering by
the spiral structure. In this range, 1/(2˜tmax) increases with Q from 0.13 to 0.15, indicating that
the dependence on Q is weak. Thus, setting 1/(2˜tmax) as the intermediate value 0.14, we obtain
the almost same formula as Equation (7).

2.3.2. Azimuthal Wavelength

Toomre (1981) concluded that ˜λy,max for the eﬃcient swing ampliﬁcation is ˜λy,max = 1–2. As
shown in Figure 3, the ampliﬁcation is signiﬁcant for ˜λy,max = 1–4 and decreases with κ/Ω. We ﬁnd
that the simple power law ˜λy,max ∝ (κ/Ω)−2 is appropriate for any Q and ˜λy,max weakly depends
on Q. While ˜λy,max decreases with Q for Q . 1.4, ˜λy,max increases with Q for Q & 1.4. Assuming
˜λy,max = (C1Q2 + C2Q + C3)(Ω/κ)2 and using the least square ﬁt method, we obtain the following
formula

κ(cid:19)2
˜λy,max = (3.653Q2 − 9.789Q + 9.721)(cid:18) Ω

.

(11)

The relative error of this formula is less than 20 %. For the range 1.4 ≤ Q ≤ 1.8, we obtain the
simpler formula

κ(cid:19)2
˜λy,max = 2.17Q(cid:18) Ω

,

(12)

where the relative error is less than 9 %.

2.3.3. Radial Wavelength

Substituting Equations (10) and (11) into Equation (6), we obtain the radial wavelength

˜λx,max =

0.581Q2 − 1.558Q + 1.547

1 + 2.095Q−5.3

.

(13)

As already mentioned, for 1.5 ≤ Q ≤ 2.0, we can approximate 1/(2˜tmax) ≃ 0.14. In this case, using
Equation (12), we obtain the simpler ﬁtting formula

˜λx,max = 0.304Q

Ω2
Aκ

.

(14)

This formula agrees well with the linear analysis. For example, ˜λx,max is almost constant for
κ/Ω < 1.5 and is about 0.7 for Q = 1.8, and for κ/Ω > 1.5, ˜λx,max increases and exceeds 1.0.

2.3.4. Ampliﬁcation Factor

The maximum ampliﬁcation factor Dmax increases with decreasing Q. This is because small
Q means that the self-gravity is strong relative to the stabilizing eﬀects due to the rotation and
the velocity dispersion. The dependence on κ/Ω is somewhat complicated. For Q = 1.0, Dmax
increases with κ/Ω from 308 to 5697. On the other hand, for Q = 1.4, Dmax is almost constant for
κ/Ω < 1.5 and is about 10 and decreases with κ/Ω for 1.6 < κ/Ω. Similarly for Q = 1.8, Dmax is
almost constant for κ/Ω < 1.5 is about 3.5 and decreases with κ/Ω for 1.6 < κ/Ω. For Q > 1.4,
we ﬁnd that the dependence of Dmax on κ/Ω is roughly described by κA/Ω2. Considering various
function forms, we ﬁnd that the dependence on Q is approximated by ∝ exp(Cq/Q) where Cq is a
constant. Using the least square ﬁt method, we obtain Dmax for Q > 1.4 as

Dmax = 0.0657 exp(cid:18) 7.61

Q (cid:19) κA
Ω2 .

(15)

This ﬁtting formula has relatively large error, but it roughly agrees with the linear analysis, which
demonstrates the sensitive dependence on Q.

3. N -Body Simulation

We perform local N -body simulations of pure stellar disks based on the epicycle approximation.

The calculation method is the same as that in Paper I. We brieﬂy summarize the method.

3.1. Model

We consider a small patch of a disk such that Lx, Ly ≪ r, where Lx and Ly are the width and
length of the patch, and r is the galactocentric distance. We adopt a local Cartesian coordinate

Toomre & Kalnajs 1991; Kokubo & Ida 1992; Fuchs et al. 2005). We assume that all particles have
the same mass. In Equation (16), 2Ωdyi/dt and −2Ωdxi/dt are the Coriolis force, 4Ω2xi is the
centrifugal force, −κ2xi and −ν 2zi are the galactic gravitational force, and the terms proportional
ij + ǫ2)−3/2 are the gravitational force from the other particles. The length ǫ is the softening
to (r2
parameter ǫ = rt/4 where rt is the tidal radius of a particle. The frequencies κ and ν are the
epicycle and vertical frequencies. We calculate the motion of particles only in the computational
box considering the periodic boundary condition (e.g., Wisdom & Tremaine 1988; Toomre & Kalnajs
1991; Fuchs et al. 2005, Paper I).

The size of the computational box Lx and Ly should be suﬃciently larger than λcr. We set
the size of the computational box as Lx = Ly = L = 15λcr. We set the unit time as Ω−1 and the
unit length as rt (Kokubo & Ida 1992). The equation of motion is integrated using a second-order
leapfrog integrator with time-step ∆t = (2π/Ω)/200. We calculate the self-gravity of particles
considering the periodic boundary condition. The cutoﬀ length of the gravity is Lcut = L. The
self-gravity of particles, which is the most computationally expensive part, is calculated using the
special-purpose computer, GRAPE-7 (Kawai & Fukushige 2006).

The initial Toomre’s Q is

(17)

where σx is the initial radial velocity dispersion (Toomre 1964). We vary κ/Ω in 1.0 ≤ κ/Ω ≤ 1.8
(1.5 ≥ Γ ≥ 0.38) with ﬁxed Qini = 1.4 and vary Qini in 1.2 ≤ Qini ≤ 1.8 with ﬁxed κ/Ω = 1.4

– 10 –

(Γ = 1.02). The initial radial velocity dispersion σx is calculated from Equation (17) using Qini.
We adopt the triaxial Gaussian model as the initial velocity distribution (Paper I). The vertical
distribution of particles is determined so that it is consistent with the velocity distribution, and x
and y of particles are distributed randomly. The initial disk parameters are summarized in Table
1. We performed the simulations with smaller Nc and L such as Nc = 2000 and L = 10λcr, and
conﬁrmed that the following results barely depend on Nc and L.

3.3. Formation of Spiral Arms

Figure 4 presents the initial evolution of the surface density for model k4. At tΩ = 0, the
particles are distributed uniformly and there are not any structures. Immediately, at tΩ = 0.5,
the spiral structure is generated spontaneously. At tΩ = 1.0, 1.5, we can observe clear spirals and
there is no diﬀerence between the two snapshots. These spirals are not steady but transient and
recurrent, which are generated and destroyed continuously. This activity continues throughout the
simulation time.

Figure 5 presents the time evolution of Q. The particles can be heated by particle-particle
interactions or particle-spiral interactions. As mentioned above, the two-body relaxation time is
suﬃciently longer than the simulation time, which means that particle-particle interactions are
negligible. Thus, the particles are mainly heated by the spiral arms. As we do not consider
any cooling processes in the N -body simulations, Q increases monotonically. With the larger
amplitude of spiral arms, heating is more eﬃcient. Since the amplitude of spiral arms in the disk
with smaller κ/Ω is larger, Q increases more quickly. In any models, during the simulation time,
Q is 1.4 . Q . 1.8.

3.4. Extraction of Dominant Wave

In order to extract a dominant wave, we adopt two methods: a Fourier transformation method

and a spatial correlation method. The Fourier amplitude of the density ﬂuctuation is deﬁned by

a(kx, ky) =ZZ (cid:18) Σ(x, y)

Σ0 − 1(cid:19) exp(i(kxx + kyy))dxdy,

(18)

where kx and ky are the radial and azimuthal wavenumbers. We calculate the time average of
the Fourier amplitude over tΩ = 1–5 and ﬁnd the wavenumber that maximizes the time averaged
δ, which corresponds to the dominant wave. The result is shown in Figure 6. In model k4, the
Fourier amplitude has a peak at kx,max/kcr = 1.0 and ky,max/kcr = 0.4 where kcr = 2π/λcr. The
corresponding wavelengths are ˜λx,max = 1.00 and ˜λy,max = 2.50. The pitch angle is calculated from
tan θmax = ky,max/kx,max, which is θmax ≃ 21◦.

The Fourier transformation method with large wavelength that is comparable to the box size
would be inaccurate. Thus, we also adopt another independent method to evaluate the dominant

We calculate the time average of the autocorrelation over tΩ = 1–5. Figure 7 presents the spatial
autocorrelation for model k4. The clear inclined structure at the center shows the averaged structure
of the spirals, which is trailing. We also observe two faint structures that are almost parallel to
the clear structure at the center. These faint structures correspond to the neighbouring spirals.
Therefore, the separation between these structures is the wavelength of the dominant spiral. Figure
8 presents ξ(x, λcr) and ξ(0, y), which show the damped oscillation. Note that in order to show the
structure in the x direction we use ξ(x, λcr) instead of ξ(x, 0). This is because the neighbouring
spirals on y = 0 is too faint to extract. Thus we focus on the line y = λcr and use ξ(x, λcr). We
calculate the wavelength from the separation between the largest and the second largest peaks and
obtain ˜λx,max = 0.92 and ˜λy,max = 2.57.

The results for the other models are summarized in Table 1. Basically, the spatial correlation
method gives the same results as those by the Fourier transformation method. For models k0, the
azimuthal wavelength by the Fourier transformation method is ˜λy,max = 5.00, which is 13 % larger
than that by the spatial correlation method. It is because the Fourier transformation method with
large wavelength is inaccurate. When the box size is 15, the wavelength that can be treated in
the Fourier transformation is 15, 7.5, 5, 3.75, · · ·. Therefore, for model k0, the spatial correlation
method is more suitable. For models k7 and k8, there is a large diﬀerence in ˜λx,max and ˜λy,max
between these two methods. For the large κ/Ω models, the amplitude of spiral arms is small. Thus,
the noise may aﬀect the estimates.

3.5. Comparison with the Julian-Toomre Model

The left panel of Figure 9 shows the dependence of θmax, ˜λy,max, ˜λx,max, and Dmax on κ/Ω.
The pitch angle increases with κ/Ω as shown in Paper I. The pitch angle by the Julian-Toomre
model Equation (10) excellently agrees with that by the N -body simulations for κ/Ω < 1.7. The
pitch angle by the N -body simulations is slightly larger than Equation (10) for κ/Ω ≥ 1.7.

The general trend of the dependence of ˜λy,max on κ/Ω in the N -body simulations is quite similar
to that in the Julian-Toomre model, Equation (11). The azimuthal wavelength ˜λy,max decreases
with κ/Ω. For κ/Ω < 1.6, ˜λy,max in the N -body simulations is slightly larger than Equation (11),
but its diﬀerence is small. The cause of the diﬀerence is unclear. One of the possible reasons is the
nonlinear eﬀect. Since the amplitude is large for small κ/Ω, the nonlinearity may be important.
Another reason is the breakdown of the assumption used to derive the ﬁtting formulae. We assumed
that the observed spirals correspond to the wave with the maximum ampliﬁcation factor. This is
justiﬁed when all the leading waves have the same amplitude. However, in reality, it is not the
case, thus the wave with the maximum ampliﬁcation factor may not correspond to the spirals in a

– 13 –

strict sense. For κ/Ω ≥ 1.6, the N -body simulations perfectly agree with Equation (11).

Both the Julian-Toomre model Equation (13) and the N -body simulations show that ˜λx,max is
almost constant for κ/Ω < 1.7 and it increases abruptly for κ/Ω ≥ 1.7. For all κ/Ω, ˜λx,max in the
N -body simulations is slightly larger than Equation (13).

In N -body simulations it is diﬃcult to deﬁne the ampliﬁcation factor in a strict sense because
we cannot extract the corresponding initial amplitude. Thus, we introduce an alternative quantity
of the ampliﬁcation. First we ﬁnd the maximum Fourier amplitude amax and the corresponding
wavelengths kx,max and ky,max. Next, since ky remains constant in the linear theory, we deﬁne
the seed amplitude aseed(C) as the Fourier amplitude with the wavenumbers kx = −Ckcr and
ky = ky,max. In the linear analyses, the wavenumber kx for the seed amplitude is calculated by
kx,i = 2Aky,maxti for the most ampliﬁed wave. Figure 10 shows kx,i and we ﬁnd that 0 < C < 3
is suﬃcient for 1.0 ≤ κ/Ω ≤ 1.8 and 1.0 ≤ Q ≤ 1.8. We deﬁne the ampliﬁcation factor as
DC = amax/aseed(C). For C = 0, this ratio D0 corresponds to the ampliﬁcation factor of a half-
swing (Toomre 1981). From the simulations we found that aseed(C) decreases with increasing C.
Therefore it is expected that D0 corresponds to the lower bound of the ampliﬁcation factor. On
the other hand, if we adopt C = 3, D3 corresponds to the upper bound. Note that we cannot
directly compare D0 and D3 with the ampliﬁcation factor Dmax because its deﬁnition is diﬀerent.
We do not discuss the absolute value of D but focus on the dependence of D on κ/Ω and Q. The
Julian-Toomre model Equation (15) shows that Dmax decreases with κ/Ω for Q ≥ 1.6. The N -body
simulations show the similar trend. In the N -body simulations D0 and D3 monotonically decreases
with κ/Ω.

The right panel of Figure 9 shows the dependence of these parameters on Q for κ/Ω = 1.4.
Since Q is not steady but increases with time, we used the time averaged Q over tΩ = 1–5, which
is summarized as Qmean in Table 1. We exclude the models with Qini = 1.0 and 1.1 because
the change of Q is signiﬁcant. In the N -body simulations, the pitch angle is almost independent
of Qmean and agrees well with those by the linear theory. The linear theory predicts that the
wavelengths ˜λy,max and ˜λx,max increase with Q for Q > 1.4. It seems that ˜λy,max measured by the
Fourier transformation increases with Q but ˜λy,max measured by the autocorrelation function is
almost constant. The wavelength ˜λy,max is about 0.5λcr longer than those by the linear theory. In
the N -body simulations, ˜λx,max increases with Qmean. The tendency is consistent with the linear
theory. Since the dependence on Q is weak and the range of Q in the N -body simulations is
narrow, it is diﬃcult to conﬁrm if the dependence of the wavelengths on Q by N -body simulations
agrees with those by the linear theory quantitatively. However at least we ﬁnd that the tendency is
generally the same. In the N -body simulations, D3 decreases with Qmean, which is consistent with
the linear theory. The half-swing ampliﬁcation factor D0 slightly decreases but is almost constant,
which shows that D0 may not be a good indicator for the degree of the ampliﬁcation for small Q.

4. Summary and Discussion

4.1. Summary

We investigated the swing ampliﬁcation based on the Julian-Toomre model (Julian & Toomre
1966). Optimizing the azimuthal wavelength ˜λy and the initial time ti that corresponds to the
initial radial wavelength, we calculated the maximum ampliﬁcation factor Dmax, and the corre-
sponding wavelengths ˜λy,max, and ˜λx,max and pitch angle θmax. As already shown in Michikoshi &
Kokubo (2014) (Paper I), θmax is in good agreement with N -body simulations. We investigated the
dependencies of θmax, ˜λy,max, ˜λx,max, and Dmax on κ/Ω and Toomre’s Q. The azimuthal wavelength
˜λy,max, that is X parameter in Julian & Toomre (1966), decreases with κ/Ω from 4 to 1, which is
consistent with the previous works (Toomre 1981; Athanassoula 1984; Dobbs & Baba 2014). We
found that λx,max is almost constant and slightly smaller than λcr for κ/Ω < 1.5. For κ/Ω > 1.5,
λx,max increases with κ/Ω. The ampliﬁcation factor Dmax decreases with Q sensitively.

Next, we performed local N -body simulations and calculated θmax, ˜λy,max, ˜λx,max, and Dmax.
We extracted the most ampliﬁed wave from N -body simulations by utilizing the Fourier transfor-
mation and the autocorrelation function of the surface density. We found that the dependencies
of θmax, ˜λy,max, and ˜λx,max on κ/Ω agree well with our ﬁtting formulae derived from the Julian-
Toomre model. The dependence of θmax on κ/Ω (which is a function of the shear rate, Γ, see
Eq. (1)) was already conﬁrmed in Paper 1, but the formulae of ˜λy,max was newly derived and
conﬁrmed with N -body simulations. We also examine the dependencies of these parameters on
Q. Because the dependence on Q is weak and it is diﬃcult to control Q in N -body simulations,
we could not clearly conﬁrm the Q dependence of these parameters completely but at least the
ﬁtting formula and N -body simulations are generally consistent. This could be tested with more
controlled N -body simulations in the future study.

The overall activity of spiral arms cannot be explained only by the linear theory of the swing
ampliﬁcation. The nonlinear processes are important (Fuchs et al. 2005; D’Onghia et al. 2013).
However, in Paper I and this paper, we showed that the linear theory of the swing ampliﬁcation
explains the spiral arm structures quantitatively. The linear theory elucidates some important
aspects of the basic physics of spiral arm dynamics.

4.2. Number of Spiral Arms

We show an example of applications of the ﬁtting formula to an observation. We can estimate
the number of spiral arms for multi-arm spiral galaxies from ˜λy,max (Carlberg & Freedman 1985).
The number of spiral arms is estimated by

m ≃

2πR

– 18 –

where R is the disk radius. In the previous works (e.g., Carlberg & Freedman 1985; Fujii et al.
2011), ˜λy,max = 2 was assumed, which is valid for Γ ≃ 1. To obtain a more general formula, we
substitute Equation (12) into Equation (20), where we approximate the orbital frequency as

Ω2 ≃

GMtot

R3 ≃

πGΣ0
Rfdisk

,

(21)

where Mtot is the total mass including the dark halo and fdisk is the ratio of disk mass to total mass.
The ratio of disk mass to halo mass ζ is also often used, which has the relation fdisk = ζ/(1 + ζ).
Thus, we obtain the number of spiral arms

m ≃ 0.230

κ4

fdiskQΩ4 = 0.922

(2 − Γ)2

.

(22)

As already shown by Carlberg & Freedman (1985), the number of spiral arms is in inversely pro-
portion to fdisk. The high resolution N -body simulations support this tendency (Fujii et al. 2011;
D’Onghia et al. 2013). This estimate also shows that m decreases with Γ, which has not been
clearly conﬁrmed by N -body simulations yet.

We can rewrite Equation (22) by using θ. Eliminating κ from Equations (7) and (22), we

obtain

which can be reduced to

where the relative error is . 5%. The number of spiral arm m increases with θ. Note that since
this estimate is based on the local approximation we should be careful when we apply it to the case
for small m.

Note that the formula of the number of spiral arms presented here is based on the extremely
simpliﬁed assumptions such as Equation (21). In fact, the number of spiral arms can depend on
the galactocentric distance (Bottema 2003; D’Onghia 2015). For more realistic estimation, we have
to consider the detailed disk and dark halo models. D’Onghia (2015) considered the exponential
stellar disk and the dark halo model of the Hernquist mass proﬁle and obtained that the number
of spiral arms depends on the galactocentric distance by assuming that the azimuthal wavelength
X = 1.5–2 that is valid for Γ ≃ 1. Using our azimuthal wavelength formula (Eq. (12)), we can
obtain more general analytic formula that also depends on θ or Γ.

Numerical computations were carried out on the GRAPE system at Center for Computational

Astrophysics, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.
