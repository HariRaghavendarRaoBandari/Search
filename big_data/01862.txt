ABSTRACT

The idea of single exomoon detection due to the radio emissions caused by its interaction with the
host exoplanet is extended to multiple-exomoon systems. The characteristic radio emissions are made
possible in part by plasma from the exomoons own ionosphere (Noyola et. al. 2014). In this work, it
is demonstrated that neighboring exomoons and the exoplanetary magnetosphere could also provide
enough plasma to generate a detectable signal. In particular, the plasma-torus-sharing phenomenon
is found to be particularly well suited to facilitate the radio detection of plasma-deﬁcient exomoons.
The eﬃciency of this process is evaluated, and the predicted power and frequency of the resulting
radio signals are presented.

1. INTRODUCTION

Exomoons continue to remain elusive despite the
steady search for over a decade. The previous suggestion
by Kipping et al. (2009) that exomoons may actually be
discovered in the data from the Kepler mission still re-
mains unconﬁrmed. Moreover, the exomoon candidates
reported by Ben-Jaﬀel et al. (2014), and Bennett et al.
(2014) have not been independently veriﬁed. Thus, the
search for exomoons continues.
In our previous work
(Noyola et al. 2014), we explained how the interactions
between an exomoon, a plasma torus, and the magne-
tosphere of Jovian exoplanet can lead to detectable ra-
dio emissions, which reveal the presence of the exomoon.
In the current paper, we show that these type of inter-
actions can be induced by plasma sources other than
the exomoons own ionosphere, particularly another ex-
omoon’s plasma torus, and that using the plasma from
those sources can make an exomoon radio detectable.
We explain how the plasma torus sharing mechanism
can readily lead to multiple exomoon detections if (i)
the plasma source is also a radio detectable exomoon, or
(ii) if two or more exomoons share the same plasma and
produce enough power. Therein lies the importance of
sharing plasma: it makes it possible to ﬁnd 2 or more ex-
omoons in a system where we would otherwise only ﬁnd
one.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we de-
scribe the basic mechanism of the Io-Jupiter system, de-
tection through plasma torus sharing is discussed in Sec.
3, the frequency and temporal characteristics of the ex-
pected radio signal are presented in Sec. 4, and the con-
sequences of these characteristics are outlined in Sec. 5.
Alternative plasma sources are discussed in Sec. 6, and
our conclusions are presented in Sec. 7.

2. BASIC MECHANISM

The idea that exomoons can be discovered with ra-
dio telescopes (Noyola et al. 2014) came from the ob-
served interaction between Jupiter and its moon Io,
which produces radio emissions in the tens of MHz
(Hess et al. 2008). Io’s ionosphere, which is produced by
volcanic activity (Lopes & Spencer 2007), injects ions

into Jupiter’s magnetosphere. The ions then co-rotate
with the Jovian magnetic ﬁeld in the plane of the mag-
netic equator, creating a plasma torus (Su 2009). The
speed diﬀerence between Io and the co-rotating plasma
creates a unipolar inductor (Goldreich et al. 1969) that
induces a current across Io’s atmosphere of a few mil-
lion Amperes. Simultaneously, the interaction between
Io and the plasma torus produces magnetic ﬁeld oscil-
lations, known as Alfv´en waves (Belcher 1987). These
oscillations generate electric ﬁelds parallel to the Jovian
magnetic ﬁeld lines, which then transport electrons to-
ward Jupiter’s magnetic poles (Neubauer 1980; Crary
1997; Saur et al. 1999; Su 2009).

As the electrons travel through the ﬁeld lines, they
emit decametric radio emissions known as Io-DAM,
through the electron cyclotron maser instability mech-
anism (Crary 1997; Mauk et al. 2001). The plasma
in Jupiter’s ionosphere then transports the electrons
between current-carrying ﬁeld lines, thus completing a
closed circuit with Io as the source of the electromotive
force. Due to Io’s role in the circuit, we will refer to it,
and all moons and exomoons of this type, as ıelectromo-
tive moons. The other Galilean moons, as well as Titan
and Enceladus on Saturn, are also electromotive moons.
Thus, electromotive moons are common in our solar sys-
tem, and may be common in other planetary systems as
well. It is noteworthy that while volcanism is essential
to the formation of a dense Ionian ionosphere, such a
process may not be required for larger moons that can
sustain thick atmospheres (e.g. Titan), which in turn
can create an ionosphere.

There are also other planetary radio emissions in the
solar system that are not related to the presence of satel-
lites, including the Jovian decametric emissions known
as non-Io-DAM which occur at the same frequencies as
Io-DAM emissions. Figure 1, taken from Zarka (1998),
shows a summary of all planetary radio emissions found
in our Solar System. The Io-DAM, and non-Io-DAM
emissions are shown to the right of the ionospheric cut-
oﬀ, and where it is clear that Io-DAM radio emissions
are considerably stronger than non-Io-DAM emissions for
most of the applicable frequencies. Later it will also be

2

shown that these two emission types have completely dif-
ferent dynamic spectra as well. As for the lower frequen-
cies, only those which are higher than the ionospheric
cut-oﬀ are relevant to this study because those are the
only frequencies that are detectable from the ground.

When extrapolating the dynamics of Io and Jupiter
to exomoons, we used the power relationship found by
Neubauer (1980), and reported in Noyola et al. (2014)
as

PS =

SB2
πβSR2
µ0

SVρ

vuut

ρS + 1

ρS

Vρ(cid:17)2 ,
µ0 (cid:16) BS

(1)

where βS is an eﬃciency coeﬃcient (≈ 1%), RS is the
exomoon radius, BS is the local magnetic ﬁeld, Vρ is the
plasma speed with respect to the exomoon, ρS is the
local plasma density, and µ0 is the permeability of free
space. The dependence of the emission power on the
exomoon’s cross-sectional area (πR2
S) leads to the ques-
tion of how large exomoons can be. Formation mod-
els suggest that moons can form around Jovian plan-
ets with masses up to 10−4 times the mass of their
host planet (Canup & Ward. 2006; Heller & Pudritz
2015). Therefore large exoplanets of 3MJ or larger
could form a Mars-size exomoon, and 10MJ exoplan-
ets could have several Mars-size exomoons or larger
(Heller & Pudritz 2015) (where 1MJ is one Jupiter
mass).
In contrast, smaller Jovian exoplanets are un-
likely to harbor large exomoons, unless those moons are
captured (Heller & Pudritz 2015). Hence, large Jovian
exoplanets are of primary importance to the existence
of large exomoons, and consequently to the mechanism
described here.

To calculate the magnetic ﬁeld we assume that the
ﬁeld is mostly dipolar, as is approximately the case for
all magnetized bodies in the solar system, and that its
angle of inclination with respect to the axis of rotation
(referred to as the z-axis hereafter) is small enough to be
neglected. In other words, we assume that the x and y
components of the dipole moment are negligible, which is
a reasonable assumption since, even at a 20◦ inclination,
the z component constitutes 94% of the total magnitude.
If the exoplanet has a magnetic dipole moment ~mP =
mP ˆz, then the exoplanet’s magnetic ﬁeld (in spherical
coordinates) is given by

B(~r) =

µ0
4π

mP

r3 (cid:0)3 cos2 θ + 1(cid:1)

2 .

(2)

The approximation for the magnetic dipole moment
is model taken from Durand-Manterola (2009), and ex-
pressed here as

mP = mJ(cid:18) MP

MJ

TJ

TP(cid:19)K

,

(3)

where MP and TP are the exoplanet’s mass and rotation
period, MJ = 1.8986 × 1027 kg, TJ is Jupiter’s rotation
period (9.925 hours), mJ is Jupiter’s magnetic dipole
moment (1.56 × 1027 Am2), and K is an experimental
constant set to 1.15 (Noyola et al. 2014) to best ﬁt the
data from Solar System’s giant planets.

The model assumes that the exoplanetary magnetic
ﬁeld rotates at the same rate as the exoplanet, as is

the case for Jupiter, and that the rotation period, TP ,
is also the same as Jupiter’s. How to predict the spin
rate of planets is still an open debate in planet forma-
tion theory, but currently the most accurate ﬁt to the
observational data is one of a linear relationship between
log(MP ) and the logarithm of a planet’s spin angular mo-
mentum (Hughes 2003). In other words, it would not be
unreasonable to assume that bigger MP means smaller
TP , especially after β Pictoris b’s rotation period was
found to be ≈ 8.1 ± 1.0 hours (Snellen et al. 2014), or
≈ 18% faster than Jupiter. Additionally, we can see from
Equation 3 that a smaller period leads to a larger mag-
netic moment, which in turn leads to a larger BS, and
thus a higher emission power PS. Therefore, assuming
that TP = TJ is a conservative assumption, and should
work well for our purposes.

The relative plasma velocity, Vρ, has two components:
the exomoon’s orbital velocity, and the corotation veloc-
ity. We assume the exomoon is in a near circular orbit
of radius rS, so its orbital velocity, Vorb, is given by,

Vorb =pGMP /rS.

To calculate the corotation velocity, Vco, we use the ﬁt
to Jupiter’s observational data

(4)

Vco = (12.6 km/s)(cid:18)1.12 −

found by Bagenal & Delamere (2011), and which is valid
for distances up to ≈ 28RJ. The plasma corotates
with the planetary magnetic ﬁeld in near-rigid corotation
(which in turn rotates with exoplanet), so the plasma’s
rotation is always prograde, unlike the exomoon which
can be either prograde or retrograde. Exomoon plasma
tori have not been well studied. To the best of our knowl-
edge, as of the time of this study Johnson & Huggins
(2006) and Ben-Jaﬀel et al. (2014) are the only articles
fully dedicated to exomoon plasma tori. Hence, we will
not attempt to generalize Equation 5 for other exomoon
plasma tori at this time.

Using Equation 5, we ﬁnd that Vρ is given by

rS

,

(6)

rS

RJ ∓r GMP

Vρ = (12.6 km/s)(cid:18)1.12 −
where the ′−′ and ′+′ signs correspond to prograde and
retrograde exomoon orbits, respectively. The direction
of rotation of the exomoon makes a big diﬀerence. As
shown in Equation 6 and Figure 2, retrograde exomoons
will have larger Vρ than prograde exomoons. Since PS
is proportional to Vρ, we can conclude that retrograde
exomoons will generate more radio power, and thus have
a better chance to be detected. Additionally, Vρ = 0
when prograde exomoons are near the synchronous orbit
(see Figure 2), so PS = 0 as well, making detections on
these orbits impossible. The retrograde case does not
have this problem, although Vρ does have a minimum
value close to the planet’s surface, as we can see from
the ﬁgure.

Since retrograde orbits have signiﬁcant advantages over
prograde orbits, a few things about their existance must
be noted. In the Solar System, the Neptunian moon Tri-
ton is the only large moon in a retrograde orbit, and it is

Radio Detection of Multiple Exomooons

precisely due to its orbit that it has long been suspected
to be a captured moon (Agnor & Hamilton 2006, and
references therein).
In fact, numerical studies suggest
that captured moons tend to stay in retrograde orbits
about 50% of the time (Porter & Grundy 2011). Thus,
capture events provide a clear path by which exomoons
can end up in a retrograde orbit. For a more comprehen-
sive review of exomoon capture see Heller et al. (2014).
Now that we have a way to calculate the emitted radio
power, we can proceed to calculate the emission’s ﬂux
density. If the exomoon is a distance d from Earth, then
the incident ﬂux density from the signal is given by

S =

PS

∆f Ωd2 ,

(7)

where PS is given by Equation 1, ∆f is the bandwidth
of the signal, usually taken to be half of the cyclotron
frequency, fC (see Section 4), and Ω is the solid angle
through which the signal is emitted. Radio waves from
electromotive moons are emitted through a hollow cone-
shaped proﬁle.
In the case of Io, the cone has a wall
thickness of ≈ 1.5◦, and a half angle ranging from 60◦
to 90◦, giving a solid angle of ≈ 0.14 − 0.16 steradians
(Lopes & Spencer 2007; Queinnec et al. 2001). We will
assume the upper value of 0.16 steradians to be the gen-
eral case for exomoons, this will ensure that large ﬂux
values will not be artiﬁcially favored.

Applying Equations 1 and 7 to Io we obtain a radio
power of ≈ 4.9 GW, and a ﬂux density of ≈ 2.7 mJy at 1
light-year from Earth. Since our eﬃciency coeﬃcient βS
is set to 1%, then the total dissipated power is ≈ 5× 1011
W, which is on the same order as values reported in the
literature (e.g. see Neubauer (1980), Crary (1997), and
Zarka (1998)). The ﬂux density for the other scenarios
discussed later can be computed using

S = (2.7 mJy)(cid:18) PS

PIo(cid:19)(cid:18) 24 MHz

d (cid:19)2
fC,max (cid:19)(cid:18) 1 ly

(8)

where the ratio PS/PIo can be obtained from Figure 4,
and fC,max can be calculated from Equation 14.

3. DETECTION THROUGH PLASMA TORUS SHARING
In our previous study (Noyola et al. 2014), we focused
on how one electromotive moon can be detected if it pro-
duces its own plasma. Now, we will explore how a neigh-
boring exomoon can share the same plasma, and induce
radio emissions of detectable amplitude. This sharing of
plasma is possible because the rotation of the planetary
magnetic ﬁeld can drive the co-rotating plasma radially
outwards. Said outwards movement is a result of or-
bital mechanics: if there is an object in a circular orbit,
and then an angular acceleration is applied to said ob-
ject, it results in a radial acceleration either outwards or
inwards, depending on the direction of the angular ac-
celeration. In our case, the plasma starts from Io’s orbit
(which is nearly circular) and is accelerated to the co-
rotation speed, obtaining an outwards radial velocity in
the process. Furthermore, Vco > Vorb for all orbits larger
than the synchronous orbit (located at ≈ 2.29RJ), so
the Jovian magnetic ﬁeld continuously accelerates Io’s
plasma outwards, giving the plasma torus its current

shape. Figure 3 shows the Io plasma torus density distri-
bution, replotted from Bagenal (1994)1. It can be seen
from the ﬁgure that Io’s plasma torus extend a signiﬁcant
distance behind Io, and it is especially dense for distances
below 7.5 RJ . The sharp decrease in plasma density seen
between 7.5 and 8 RJ , known as the ramp, is believed to
be caused by Jupiter’s ring current (Siscoe et al 1981).
The ionic composition and detailed features of extra-
solar plasma tori may vary for each system, but the
characteristics that give rise to the general shape of the
plasma distribution are quite general. These character-
istics include: (i) a central mass to orbit, like Jupiter;
(ii) a source of plasma strong enough to sustain a torus,
like Io; (iii) a satellite to interact with the plasma, also
like Io; and (iv) a rotating magnetic ﬁeld, like on Jupiter.
All these properties are required to obtain a co-rotating,
radially-expanding plasma torus whose behavior should
be similar to that of Io’s. We will now use this plasma
torus to demonstrate that sharing plasma can eﬀectively
lead to detection of multiple exomoons.

To illustrate the mechanism, we will

substitute
Jupiter’s moon, Europa, for a hypothetical exomoon. We
will change the exomoon’s radius, and orbital distance to
simulate the scenarios that could be encountered in ex-
oplanetary systems. For RS we will use the three values
corresponding to Io (1821.3 km), Europa (1560.8 km),
and Ganymede (2631 km). As for the orbital radius, rS,
the exomoon cannot be too far away because the plasma
torus would be too diluted to cause any signiﬁcant ef-
fect, and it cannot be too close to Io (rS ≈ 6.03RJ) or
the system might become orbitally unstable. For the up-
per limit, we can simply chose rS ≤ 10RJ. For the lower
limit, however, more care must be taken to establish cri-
teria which agrees with known stability models. First,
the moon system described here consists of a very large
central mass and two orbiting masses of comparable size,
so stability criteria used with the restricted three-body
problem cannot be applied here. Perhaps the closest sta-
bility results that can be applied to our system are those
found for Kepler-36, which consists of a Sun-like star, a
super-Earth, and a mini-Neptune. The two planets orbit
at 0.1153 and 0.1283 au (respectively), making them the
planets with the closest orbits with respect to each other
known to date.

Since the notion of Hill stability has been extended to
the general three-body problem (see Marchal & Bozis
(1982), also Szenkovits & Mak´o (2008) and references
therein), the radius of the Hill sphere, RH , is given by

3MP(cid:19)
RH ≈ a(1 − e)(cid:18) MS

1

,

(9)

where a, e, and MS are the semi-major axis, eccentricity,
and mass of the moon, respectively. When Equation 9
is applied to Io, Europa, and Ganymede the largest Hill
radius found is that of Ganymede at 0.453 RJ . In other
words, we can choose our exomoon’s smallest orbit to be
6.5RJ, and still have all satellites be outside each other’s
Hill sphere. Thus, the range 7RJ ≤ rS ≤ 10RJ fulﬁlls
this last requirement also. Callisto was excluded since

1 The data was ﬁtted using a natural cubic spline algorithm;
high precision was kept to ensure numerical agreement with the
original model.

its orbit (a ≈ 26.9RJ) is too far away from Io to be rele-
vant for this study. For clariﬁcation, this paper does not
intend be a complete exomoon orbital stability analysis,
but only to provide a range of orbital distances where
the exomoon can reasonably be expected to survive in
the long term.

Using Equation 1, we calculated the expected output
power for the previously mentioned values of RS for the
prograde and retrograde cases. The results, presented
in Figure 4, show that plasma torus sharing can be an
extremely important mechanism for making electromo-
tive moons detectable. For example, if Io is detectable
then either a Ganymede-size prograde exomoon, or an
Io-size retrograde exomoon would also be detectable up
to rS ≈ 7.3RJ away from Jupiter. More strikingly, a
Ganymede-size retrograde exomoon would be twice as
powerful as Io at this distance, and be detectable up
to 0.5RJ farther than the exomoons in the previous ex-
ample.
In other words, this Ganymede-size retrograde
exomoon could be detectable even if the plasma source
is not.

4. SIGNAL FREQUENCY, BANDWIDTH, AND

PERIODICITY

As mentioned before, exomoon radio signals are pro-
duced through an electron cyclotron maser process. The
frequency of these cyclotron emissions, the so called cy-
clotron frequency, is controlled by the strength of the
magnetic ﬁeld at emission site. Explicitly, the cyclotron
frequency, fC , is given by

fC =

e

2πme

B,

(10)

where B is the magnetic ﬁeld at the point of emission,
e is the electron charge, and me is the electron mass.
Writing the coeﬃcient in Equation 10 explicitly yields
the more convenient form fC = (2.8 MHz/Gauss)B.

Since each exomoon in the system is connected to a
diﬀerent ﬁeld line2, then we need to know B at any point
within that speciﬁc ﬁeld line. If the exomoon is near the
exoplanet’s rotational equator, then the points on the
ﬁeld line are constrained by the relationship r = rS sin2 θ.
Combining this expression with sin2 θ + cos2 θ = 1, we
ﬁnd that cos2 θ = 1 − r/rS, which we can substitute into
Equation 2 to get

B(~r) =

(11)

Thereby eliminating the θ dependence from the mag-
netic ﬁeld equation. Within the path of the electrons
traveling between an electromotive moon and the exo-
planet, the largest magnetic ﬁeld is found at the exo-
planet’s ionosphere (at r ≈ RP ). Therefore, the maxi-
mum emitted cyclotron frequency is emitted at the exo-
planet’s ionosphere as well. Combining Equation 10 with
Equation 11, and setting r = RP we ﬁnd that

fmax =

2 Since RS << rS, we take the ﬁeld line that passes through the

center of the exomoon to be the average ﬁeld line.

which is the maximum frequency that can be emitted
along the ﬁeld line connected to the exomoon. Using
Equation 3 and simplifying, we get the more convenient
expression

fmax = (4.367×1030 m3/s)

(13)
Equation 12 is asymptotic, approaching a maximum
value of (µ0emP )/(4π2meR3
P ) as rS becomes very large.
This value provides a maximum cutoﬀ frequency for all
the moons in the system. If the radius of the exoplanet
is not known when calculating fmax, many authors (e.g.
(Griessmeier et al. 2007, and references therein)) choose
to assume RP ≈ RJ . Studies on the radius-mass rela-
tionship of exoplanets show that RP = RJ is a good
approximation for Jovian exoplanets (Mordasini et al.
2012, and references therein), and therefore we will use
this approximation as well. For the case of Jupiter, with
a magnetic dipole moment m = 1.56 × 1027 Am2, and a
radius RJ = 69, 911 km, Equation 12 can be simpliﬁed
to

fmax = (12.8 MHz)(cid:18)4 − 3

RJ

rS (cid:19)

,

(14)

Using Equation 14, we plotted fmax and identiﬁed the
expected bandwidth for 6RJ ≤ rS ≤ 10RJ on Figure
5. It is clear from the plot that fmax varies very slowly
with rS until it reaches its maximum value of 25.6 MHz,
so identifying diﬀerent exomoons using frequency might
be diﬃcult. To ﬁnd just how diﬃcult, we need to ﬁnd
what is the largest frequency error, δfmax, that we can
admit if we require an uncertainty of δrR,f or less in
our measurements. The two uncertainties are related by
δrS,f = (∂rS)/(∂fmax)δfmax, which we can solve for δfC
to yield

δfmax =

δrS,f

∂rS/∂fmax

.

(15)

Implicitly diﬀerentiating Equation 12 with respect to rS,
and solving for the derivative we get

∂rS

∂fmax

=

16π2meR2
P

3µ0emP qr3

S (4rS − 3RP ),

(16)

At ﬁrst Equation 16 appears to be independent from
fmax, but the dependency was simply hidden by the im-
plicit diﬀerentiation, and can be recovered by removing
the radical with Equation 12. Combining Equations 14
and 16 yields

δfmax =

δrS,f .

(17)

(19.2 MHz) RJ
pr3
S (4rS − 3RJ )

This equation predicts that δfmax is approximately
proportional to 1/r2
S, so that exomoons closer to their
exoplanet requires less accuracy in the measurement of
fmax. For example, having δrS,f ≤ 0.1RJ would require
δfmax ≤ 10 kHz for rS = 10RJ, but δfmax ≤ 20 kHz
at 7RJ . Nonetheless, we expect bandwidths in the tens
of MHz, so an uncertainty of tens of kHz represents an
accuracy of less than 0.1%, which can be challenging.

Radio Detection of Multiple Exomooons

5

In fact, due to the noisy nature of the emission mech-
anism it is most likely not possible to observe such a
small diﬀerence in frequency. Nevertheless, exoplanets
with larger masses may provide a solution to this prob-
lem. For example, using Equation 13 with two exomoons,
one at 6.03RJ and one at 7.2RJ , for a 4MJ exoplanet,
we ﬁnd that the diﬀerence between their frequencies is
≈ 1.3 MHz. Similarly, if the exoplanet’s mass is increased
to 8MJ , the frequency diﬀerence between the exomoons
increases to ≈ 3 MHz.
It is unclear how the increase
in planetary mass will aﬀect the natural noisiness of the
signal, but 1 MHz is 50 times larger than the 20 kHz
mentioned earlier, so if the signal noise remains similar
to that seen on Jupiter, then we can ascertain that it
is easier to distinguish between exomoons around larger
exoplanets.

Although identiﬁcation of multiple exomoons can be
done with frequency measurements, the best way to dis-
tinguish between exomoons is the diﬀerences in the pe-
riodicity of their signal’s features. Exomoon signals re-
peat twice per orbital period, showing maximum inten-
sity whenever the exomoon is approximately to the side
of the exoplanet, as seen from Earth. A clear example
of this periodicity is Io, whose signal was found to peak
whenever the moon was close to either 93◦or 246◦from
the Earth-Jupiter line (Bigg 1964). To assess how accu-
rately we need to measure an exomoon’s orbital period,
TS, we will analyze it as we did for frequency.

The relationship between the required accuracy on rS,

δrS,T , and the measured uncertainty on TS, δTS, is

δTS =

δrS,T

∂rS/∂TS

.

(18)

From Newton’s laws, we know that the relationship be-
tween rS and TS is given by

r3
S =

GMP
4π2 T 2
S.

(19)

Diﬀerentiating as before, and eliminating TS with Equa-
tion 19 we get

∂rS
∂TS

3πr GMP

rS

.

(20)

Finally, substituting Equation 20 into Equation 18, we
ﬁnd that

δTS = 3πδrS,Tr rS

GMP

.

(21)

For our hypothetical exomoon, the orbital period
ranges from 2-4 days. Using Equation 21 with our exam-
ple, we ﬁnd that a δrS,T ≤ 0.1RJ can be obtained with
a δTS as large as 1 hour. In fact, a δrS,T ≤ 0.01RJ can
be attained with a δTS of 6 minutes. Comparing these
values to the time scales shown in Figure 6a, we see that
6 minutes of accuracy would not be hard to obtain from
Io-DAM emissions (panel a), which have time scales of a
few hours.

Although measuring TS leads to more accurate identiﬁ-
cations than frequency measurements, measuring fC,max
accurately is still critical because, as we shall see in the
next section, these measurements allow us to know some

important properties of the system without the need for
computational signal analysis.

5. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DERIVED FROM MULTIPLE

DETECTIONS

If we divide Equation 19 by (4/3)πR3

P , we ﬁnd that

the density of exoplanet, DP , can be expressed as

DP =

3π
GT 2

RP(cid:19)3
S (cid:18) rS

,

(22)

but we need to know the ratio rs/RP in advance. If the
signals of at least two exomoons are detected in a sys-
tem, we can use that information to calculate that value.
Knowing the maximum frequency and orbital period for
two exomoons, (Ti, fi) and (Tj, fj), we can use Equation
12 to get

ri(cid:19) 4ri − 3RP
4rj − 3RP
which we can further rearrange to obtain

=(cid:18) rj

fj(cid:19)2
(cid:18) fi

(23)

ri
RP

(24)

Notice the ratio ri/rj is still needed; however, this ratio
can easily be obtained because both exomoons orbit the
same exoplanet. Using Equation 19 with ri and rj, we
ﬁnd that

ri
rj

=(cid:18) Ti

(25)

which provides the last piece of data needed to calcu-
late the DP . Additionally, Equation 24 can be solved for
either exomoon, and each solution can be used to cal-
culate DP separately. Hence, we can average the values
of DP and further reduce the uncertainty by a factor of
√2. Even better, now that we know rs/RP , and if and if
RP is also known (e.g. from planetary transits), we can
use Equation 12 to calculate rs, MP and mP as well. In
other words, a multiple-exomoon detection allows us to
readily calculate almost all the system’s physical quan-
tities without the need for complex numerical methods.
One might argue that the previously mentioned noisiness
of the signals will make it diﬃcult to measure frequency
diﬀerences accurately, but it should still give us a rough
idea of the conﬁguration of the system. In this regard,
the situation can be likened to other known cases where
planetary properties have not been measured to high ac-
curacy (e.g. OGLE-2006-BLG-109L c has a semi-major
axis of 4.5± 2.2 AU (Bennett et al. 2010)), and yet still
give great insight into the inner structure of the system.

6. MORE PLASMA SOURCES

Our previous discussion was focused on one exomoon
(the receptor) using plasma from a neighboring exo-
moon (the donor) to become detectable. However,
the receptor exomoon itself can also be a source of
plasma. For example, Bagenal
(1994) noted that the
increase in oxygen ions seen past 7.5 RJ in Figure 3
could mean that Europa is also a source of plasma for

6

Noyola Satyal Musielak

the system. Later studies corroborate this statement,
and further state that Europa can sustain an average
plasma density of ≈ 2500 amu/cm3, which is much less
than Io (≈ 42300 amu/cm3), but signiﬁcantly larger
than Ganymede (≈ 54 amu/cm3), and Callisto (≈ 1.6
amu/cm3) (Kivelson et al. 2004). To illustrate, the ex-
omoon c on Figure 6 receives plasma from exomoon b
but it also produces its own plasma torus, and uses the
combination of both plasmas to generate currents.
In
contrast, exomoon d does not produce its own plasma
torus, but it can still use the plasma provided by exo-
moons b and c. Similarly, the exoplanet itself could be
the source of plasma for an exomoon that cannot pro-
duce its own. An exomoon of this type, which depends
solely on the plasma trapped in the exoplanets magneto-
sphere to produce currents, is illustrated by exomoon a
on Figure 6.

The amount of planetary plasma increases with de-
creasing exoplanet semi-major axis due to increasing stel-
lar XUV irradiation (Koskinen et al. 2010). Thus, stel-
lar irradiation could conceivably make it possible for elec-
tromotive moons to be detected in the magnetospheric
plasma of hot Jupiters. Auroral radio emissions equiva-
lent to non-Io-DAM will increase as well (Nichols 2011;
Zarka 2007, and references therein), but given the dif-
ferences in spectral signatures between Io-DAM and non-
Io-DAM we do not expect these emissions to be a signif-
icant problem. Explicitly, exomoon signals should show
long, thin arcs lasting several hours, like those on the
simulated Io-DAM dynamic spectra shown on Figure 7a
(Taken from Hess et al. 2008), whereas exoplanet sig-
nals should show a wide-band, near-constant signal like
the one shown for a hypothetical hot Jupiter on Figure
7b (Taken from Hess & Zarka 2011).

In general, we can say that an electromotive moon
can obtain plasma from three diﬀerent sources: (1) its
own ionosphere, (2) the plasma torus of another moon,
and (3) and its exoplanet’s magnetospheric plasma. To
take into account the plasma from all sources, we set the
plasma density near an exomoon to be the sum of the
plasma from all sources,

ρS(rS) = XAll sources

ρi(rS)

(26)

and then use that plasma density to calculate the emis-
sions’ power and expected ﬂux density. It is important to
note, however, that Equation 1 shows asymptotic behav-
ior in its dependance to ρS, and it can reach a saturation
point at which the increase in PS with increasing plasma
density is negligible. In other words, if we let ρS grow
to inﬁnity, then PS becomes independent of the plasma

density. The point at which the eﬀects of changing ρS
begin to have little eﬀect on output power is given by

ρC =

1

Vρ (cid:19)2
µ0 (cid:18) BS

(27)

where we have deﬁned ρC to be this particular value of
ρS. We call ρC the critical plasma density.

Thus, substituting Equation 27 into Equation 1, we
can see that when ρS reaches ρC , PS is already past 70%
of its maximum. Curves (a) and (b) on Figure 3 show
ρC for the prograde and retrograde case of our example,
respectively. From the graph we see that the value of ρC
is at least 1 order of magnitude higher than ρS at every
point on the Io plasma torus, which hints that ρC can
be expected to be generally high. In other words, it can
be safely claimed that more plasma means more radio
power from exomoons.

7. CONCLUSIONS

Our previously proposed idea of single moon detec-
tion due to its radio emission caused by the interaction
with a Jupiter-like exoplanet (Noyola et al. 2014) is now
extended to a second exomoon as well as to multiple-
exomoon systems. We suggested that plasma sources
other than an exomoon’s own ionosphere, such as the
plasma torus sharing described here, can lead to the pro-
duction of radio signals, and the resulting emissions from
this process can be used to detect multiple exomoons. We
referred to such exomoons as electromotive moons, and
pointed out that they could be common.

Plasma torus sharing could be the dominant path by
which multiple electromotive moons from a single sys-
tem can become detectable. The signal from each exo-
moon in a multiple-exomoon system can be distinguished
from the others because of its unique periodicity, and to
some extend from its maximum cyclotron frequency. The
information obtained from multiple-exomoon detections
can be used to infer various physical properties of the
system, including each exomoon’s orbital radius, and the
exoplanet’s mass, radius, and magnetic dipole moment.
