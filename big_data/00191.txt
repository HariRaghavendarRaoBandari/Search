Abstract

We report on the exciton propagation in polar (Al,Ga)N/GaN quantum wells over several mi-

crometers and up to room temperature. The key ingredient to achieve this result is the crystalline

quality of GaN quantum wells (QWs) grown on GaN template substrate. By comparing micro-

photoluminescence images of two identical QWs grown on sapphire and on GaN, we reveal the

twofold role played by GaN substrate in the transport of excitons. First, the lower threading

dislocation densities in such structures yield higher exciton radiative eﬃciency, thus limiting non-

radiative losses of propagating excitons. Second, the absence of the dielectric mismatch between

the substrate and the epilayer strongly limits the photon guiding eﬀect in the plane of the struc-

ture, making exciton transport easier to distinguish from photon propagation. Our results pave

the way towards room-temperature gate-controlled exciton transport in wide-bandgap polar het-

erostructures.

Introduction. An indirect exciton (IX) in a semiconductor quantum-well (QW) is a quasi-

particle composed of an electron and a hole separated along the growth direction, but still

bound by Coulomb interaction.

IXs can be realised in both wide single QWs [1] and in

coupled QWs [2]. The prominent feature of IXs is their long lifetime, exceeding lifetimes of

regular direct excitons by orders of magnitude [3, 4]. Their long lifetimes allow IXs to travel

over large distances before recombination, providing the opportunity to study exciton trans-

port by optical imaging [5–7]. Moreover, they possess strong permanent dipole moments

along the growth axis, which is essential for electrical control of excitonic ﬂuxes, and for

excitonic device operation [7–11]. IXs were most extensively studied in GaAs-based QWs

[2, 5, 12–16], but recently their realisation in wide bandgap semiconductors such as GaN

[17], and ZnO [18], has been considered. GaN/(Al,Ga)N and ZnO/(Zn,Mg)O wide QWs

grown along the (0001) crystal axis, naturally exhibit built-in electric ﬁelds up to MV/cm

[19, 20], so that IXs are naturally created in the absence of any external electric ﬁeld. Such

IXs have binding energy of tens of meV, largely above the 4 meV reached in a typical GaAs-

based structure [21, 22]. This may extend the operation of the excitonic devices up to room

temperature. Furthermore, such materials are promising candidates for the realisation of

coherent states of IXs at temperatures higher than a fraction of Kelvin [23, 24]. These prop-

erties make materials with robust IXs particularly interesting. Nevertheless, so far, even in

these materials with robust excitons there were no evidence of room-temperature transport

[17, 18].

In this Letter we demonstrate excitonic transport up to room temperature over distances
up to 5−10 µm in GaN/(Al,Ga)N QW grown on GaN substrate. By comparing time-resolved
photoluminescence (PL) and spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence (µPL) images of

two identical QWs grown, respectively, on GaN and on sapphire, we reveal the important

role played by the substrate in exciton propagation. First, the radiative eﬃciency appears

to be higher for GaN-grown structures, with much weaker temperature-induced quenching,

presumably due to lower threading dislocation densities. Second, the absence of dielectric

mismatch between the substrate and the epilayer strongly limits the photon guiding eﬀect

along the plane of the structure, making exciton transport easier to distinguish from photon

propagation [17]. Careful benchmarking of spatial and temporal dynamics suggests that

even in the best quality QWs grown on GaN substrate, most of exciton propagation in

the optically excited QW takes place in the regime where built-in electric ﬁeld is eﬃciently

2

screened by the presence of relatively high densities of dipolar IXs. These results constitute

an important building block for our understanding of exciton transport in wide-bandgap

polar heterostructures, and pave the way towards room-temperature gate-controlled exciton

transport.

Samples and experimental setup. The studied structures are 7 nm-wide single GaN QWs

grown along the (0001) axis. QWs are embedded in 45 nm / 140 nm Al0.19Ga0.81N barriers,

grown on either sapphire (Sample 1) or GaN (Sample 2) substrate following the deposition

of 3 µm thick templates. The schematic band diagram of the structure is given in Fig. 1(a).

Due to the diﬀerence in spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization between the well and

barrier materials, interfacial ﬁxed charges accumulate, resulting in a a built-in electric ﬁeld

estimated as 1 MV/cm in this structure [25]. The built-in electric ﬁeld pushes the electron

and the hole toward opposite interfaces of the QW, breaking the symmetry of the excitonic

wavefunction, and inducing a permanent dipole moment along the growth axis. Optical

excitation of the structure results in the screening of the built-in ﬁeld, and in a blue shift

EBS of the exciton energy EX with respect to E0, the energy of the exciton ground state in

the absence of photo-excitation (Fig. 1(b)). The dependence of EBS on the exciton density

n is estimated by solving numerically the coupled Schr¨odinger-Poisson equations by the

self-consistent procedure described in Ref. 25. The result of this calculation is nicely ﬁtted
by a linear law: EBS = Φ0n, where Φ0 = 10−13 eV/cm2. The energy of the unscreened
QW E0 ≈ 3.0 eV was obtained numerically and measured via time-resolved experiments
presented below.

In µPL experiments, a cw laser beam at λ = 266 nm was focused onto a 1 µm spot on the

sample surface. In time-resolved measurements, excitons were photogenerated by frequency-

tripled Ti-sapphire laser at the same wavelength (pulse duration 150 fs, repetition rate 8 kHz,
average power 660 nW) and using a ∼ 100 µm excitation spot diameter. Spectrally-resolved
images were obtained using a spectrometer equipped with a 150 gr/mm grating blazed at
390 nm. The detector for spatially resolved images was a CCD camera with 1024×512 pixels
and pixel size of 13 µm, which corresponds to 0.405 µm on the sample surface. Time-resolved

measurements of the emission kinetics were performed using a Hamamatsu streak camera

(model C10910 equipped with an S20 photocathode and UV coupling optics), enhanced for

ultraviolet detection.

Experimental results and discussion. Fig. 2 shows µPL spectra (colour-encoded in log

3

scale) as a function of the distance r from the excitation spot. Images were taken for the

two samples and at three diﬀerent temperatures (excitation power P = 1.3 mW). Excitonic

recombination in the GaN template and/or substrate, near E = 3.48 eV is rapidly quenched

by increasing temperature. Below this energy the emission is dominated by QW excitons,

with several phonon replicas below the zero-phonon line. At 30 K in both samples one can

clearly see the arrow-shaped pattern, characteristic of exciton propagation, accompanied by

the decrease of the emission intensity and energy [5, 17]. The spatial extension of the arrow-

shaped pattern is similar for the two samples. While in Sample 1 this pattern is completely

washed out at 300 K, in Sample 2 exciton emission and propagation persist up to room

temperature. Two other prominent features can be observed in Sample 1 only. These are

(1) interference fringes and (2) a strong emission tail with spatially independent energy at

long distances (above 30 µm). Both features have already been observed in samples grown

on sapphire substrates [17]. We attributed the fringes to Fabry-Perot interferences due

to the reﬂection at the GaN/sapphire interface, and the emission tails to the emission of

excitons created by a secondary absorption process. Indeed, a signiﬁcant part of the higher-

energy photons emitted around r = 0 by the QW itself is guided along the sample due

to high refractive index contrast between GaN and sapphire, as well as between (Al,Ga)N

and air. These photons are capable of creating, at larger distances, secondary excitons

(Fig. 1(c)).

In Sample 2 interference fringes are suppressed, because it does not have

GaN/Sapphire interface. Nevertheless, even for Sample 2, a non-zero density of secondary

photons is still present along the sample plane. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 3(a, b),

where colour-encoded µPL intensity spatial maps normalized by power are shown at 10 K

for two diﬀerent excitation powers: the tails observed at 3.4 eV (a) and 3.2 eV (b) are

attributed to scattered secondary photons produced by the exciton emission at r = 0. The

colour scale is the same as in Fig. 2, and the acquisition time is 10 times longer. We argue

that propagation of secondary photons along the sample plane remains possible, although

less eﬃcient than in Sample 1, probably due to total internal reﬂection at the sample surface

(Fig. 1(d)). The ﬂuctuating energy tail is particularly visible in Fig. 3(b) at 3.05–3.1 eV,
with a clear jump of emission energy at r ≈ −30 µm. Like in Sample 1, this low-intensity
emission is related to the secondary excitons created far from the laser excitation spot.

These excitons contribute to the screening of the built-in electric ﬁeld and of the in-plane

potential ﬂuctuations resulting from the disorder, and thus are important for the transport

4

of excitons created directly under the laser spot [6, 26, 27].

Because photon guiding is only partly suppressed in the absence of GaN/sapphire inter-

face, it is important to evaluate the energy of the unscreened structure in an independent

time-resolved experiment. For this purpose, we used a pulsed laser excitation with low rep-

etition frequency and low average power. Typical time-resolved PL spectra measured in

Sample 2 at T = 10 K and at diﬀerent time delays with respect to the excitation pulse are

shown in Fig. 4 (a). One can see that the QW emission energy EX goes from 3.06 eV down
to E0 ≈ 3.0 eV, the value that should thus be considered as the energy of the unscreened
structure. The integrated intensity of exciton emission as a function of time, and the blue-

shift of the zero-phonon PL line with respect to E0 are shown by symbols in Figs. 4 (b) and

4 (c), respectively. The blue-shift exponentially decreases towards E0 with a time constant

of 2 µs, as shown by a solid line in Fig. 4(c). After the same time transient the decay of

the integrated intensity reaches an exponential behavior with τ (n = 0) = 10 µs, shown by

a solid line in Fig. 4 (b). This slow decay of integrated intensity corresponding to almost

constant emission energy E0 provides the estimation of exciton radiative lifetime in the un-

screened QW with zero exciton density. Similar analysis in Sample 1 gives τ (n = 0) = 22 µs
and E0 ≈ 3.08 eV. The reasons for this diﬀerence may be related to slight non intentional
variations in the QW width and in the barrier composition. From this analysis we deduce

that all the emission observed in cw experiments presented here stems from QW regions

were original built-in electric ﬁeld and its ﬂuctuations are partly screened due to photoexci-
tation. A signiﬁcant density of excitons exceeding 1011 cm−2 is therefore present along the
QW plane up to 100 µm away from the excitation spot.

On the basis of this analysis of the unscreened system we can address exciton propagation

quantitatively. Fig. 3 (c) shows normalized integrated intensity of the QW exciton PL in

Sample 2, at T = 10 K and for the same excitation powers in Figs. 3(a-b). Solid lines are a ﬁt

to a Gaussian distribution with half width at half maximum HWHM=5.9 µm, and a dashed

line shows the laser intensity proﬁle, characterized by a twice smaller HWHM=2.7 µm.

It seems surprising, at ﬁrst sight, that increasing the power does not help increasing the

intensity of the light emitted by excitons away from the excitation spot. To understand this

eﬀect, it is instructif to compare the corresponding spatial proﬁles of the emission energy

(Fig. 3 (a-b)). The PL blue-shift is proportional to the local exciton density, and one

can see that its spatial extension is much larger at 1 mW that at 0.03 mW. Indeed, we

5

plot on top of the colormaps in Fig. 3(a) and (b), Lorentzian proﬁles with HWHM=20

and 14 µm, which characterize the spatial distribution of the QW emission energy (even

though the experimentally observed energy proﬁles have much more complex shapes). We

suggest, that the strong diﬀerence between the spatial proﬁles of energy and intensity is

a consequence of the strong density dependence of the exciton radiative lifetime. This

dependence is a prominent feature of IXs: increasing exciton density reduces exciton lifetime

exponentially [17, 25]. It can be clearly seen in spatially integrated time-resolved experiments

presented above, that as long as exciton emission exhibits a measurable blue-shift, the time-

dependence of the emission intensity cannot be described by a single-exponential decay (see

Fig. 4 (b-c)). A quantitative study of this phenomenon combining spatially- and time-

resolved µPL experiments would be of great interest, but it requires further experimental

developments. Such studies are also mandatory to go further than our previous work [17] in

the theoretical modelling of the exciton transport in this system, involving strong disorder,

dipolar interactions and density-dependent exciton lifetimes. Here we just stress that the

exciton propagation length is determined by the spatial proﬁle of the emission energy blue-

shift, rather than by the spatial proﬁle of the integrated emission intensity.

Let us now address the temperature dependence of the exciton transport. In Fig. 2 we

show on top of the colormaps Lorentzian proﬁles with HWHM values far above the excitation

spot size. These values are indicated for each measurement. The zero-density limit (slightly

diﬀerent for the two samples as measured in time-resolved PL experiments) is shown by

the dashed lines. Here we neglect the combined eﬀect of band-gap renormalisation and the

exciton localisation on the zero-density emission energy. Strictly speaking, the variation
of ±25 meV can be expected [19]. This deﬁnes the precision of the propagation length
determination, that we estimate to be of order of ±3 µm.
In Sample 1, the signal was
too low at room temperature to estimate the propagation length, while in Sample 2 the
HWHM of the Lorentzian proﬁle that deﬁnes the is propagation length is ≈ 12 µm at room
temperature. This is less than maximum value measured at 10 K (Fig. 3(a)), but is a

remarkable result of this work.

Fig. 5(a) shows a set of spectrally-integrated and normalised spatial proﬁles of exciton

emission in Sample 2 for ﬁve diﬀerent temperatures from 10 to 200 K. A constant vertical

oﬀset is introduced for clarity, and a dashed line shows the excitation spot proﬁle, charac-

terised by a HWHM= 2.7 µm. By comparing the measured intensity proﬁles (symbols) with

6

a Gaussian proﬁle of HWHM=5.3 µm and with the laser spot proﬁle, we conclude that the

exciton emission intensity pattern is twice more extended than the laser spot and that the

temperature dependence of this extension is very weak. This means that, with increasing

temperature up to 200 K, excitons are not lost via nonradiative recombination, but continue

to contribute to the PL. This is in contrast with Sample 1, where the non-radiative emission

rate increases with temperature. To quantify this eﬀect we compare in Fig. 5(b) the total

emission intensity measured in experiments like those shown in Fig. 2, but integrated both

in energy and in space over a surface of 8000 µm2, for the two samples. One can see that,

at highest excitation power, in Sample 2, the temperature dependence is indeed very weak,

while in Sample 1 the intensity decreases by almost one order of magnitude when increasing

temperature by a factor of ten. This means that the suppression of the nonradiative losses

is crucial for exciton propagation at room temperature. At low excitation power the total

integrated PL intensity is similar for the two samples. This suggests that even in Sample 2

nonradiative centers are not fully saturated in this weak excitation regime. The activation of

nonradiative losses at low powers is a well-known eﬀect in GaN and InGaN heterostructures

[28, 29].

Despite low nonradiative losses, and their weak temperature dependence, exciton emission

maps for Sample 2 at 30 and 300 K are very diﬀerent (Fig. 2(d, f)). The reason for this is the

huge broadening of the exciton line. This eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 5(c), where normalised

exciton PL spectra measured 10 µm away from the laser spot are shown for three diﬀerent

temperatures. The peak emission energy is slightly diﬀerent for the three spectra. This

diﬀerence is related to the variation in the exciton density but may be contributed by the

renormalization of the bandgap and the localisation eﬀects at low temperature [19, 30, 31].

The width of the spectrum increases with temperature. At room temperature the spectrum

is so broad that even the ﬁrst phonon replica cannot be distinguished. At low temperatures
and low densities (far away from the excitation spot) the linewidth is w10K ≈ 40 meV,
limited by the in-plane disorder. Indeed, we estimated that monolayer ﬂuctuations of the

QW width in the presence of an electric ﬁeld of 1 MV/cm induce ﬂuctuations of the in-
plane potential Urand ≈ 26 meV, and the ﬂuctuations of the aluminium content in the
barriers induce Urand ≈ 20 meV per aluminium percent. Under the same conditions at
room temperature the line is so broad that it is quite diﬃcult to estimate the linewidth
precisely: w300K ≈ 130 ± 20 meV. The increase of the exciton linewidth with temperature

7

has already been observed in similar structures [32]. For the highest excitation power used

in this work (P = 1.3 mW) at T = 10 K the linewidth reaches 80 meV. The exciton emission

proﬁle remains Gaussian as far as the exciton emission energy remains below E = 3.4 eV,

corresponding to a blue-shift EBS = 400 meV. At higher carrier densities (only reached

in the small area around the excitation spot at P = 1.3 mW (see Fig. 2(d)), the line

shape changes and its width increases dramatically, as expected at Mott transition [32]. We

estimate the corresponding Mott density from the emission blue shift EBS = 400 meV as
nM = 4 × 1012 cm−2, close to the values reported in [32].

Conclusions. We have demonstrated exciton transport in a GaN/(Al,Ga)N QW grown

on a GaN substrate. Propagation over 12 µm at room temperature and 20 µm at 10 K is

reported. From the comparison of two nominally identical samples grown on GaN and sap-

phire, respectively, we conclude that suppression of nonradiative losses at room temperature

is the key to achieve this result. We have shown that the spatial distribution of excitons

propagating away from the excitation spot is much wider than the corresponding distribu-

tion of the emission intensity, due to the strong density dependence of the exciton emission

rate. The comparison of spatial and time-resolved experiments provides a clear evidence,

that exciton transport is accompanied by photon propagation along the structure plane.

This eﬀect is much stronger in sapphire-grown samples but nevertheless cannot be neglected

in GaN-grown samples.

It is responsible for the partial screening of the built-in electric

ﬁeld, so that the fully unscreened regime is hard to reach in cw experiments. Our results

provide a rich playground for further understanding of exciton transport and elaboration of

new transport models, in order to optimize exciton propagation.

from the excitation spot, at 5 diﬀerent temperatures. Solid lines are identical Gaussians

with HWHM=5.3 µm. Excitation power P = 2.3 MW/cm2. (b) PL intensity integrated

over energy (same as in (a)) and over surface (from 0 to 100 µm from the spot), as a

11

function of temperature, for two diﬀerent excitation powers (15 mW (red, black) and 0.5 mW

(cyan, magenta) for the two samples. (c) Normalised PL spectra measured at three diﬀerent

temperatures at 10 µm distance from the excitation spot.
