Girth at least Four and Five

March 15, 2016

Abstract

In this paper, we address the maximum number of vertices of induced forests in
subcubic graphs with girth at least four or ﬁve. We provide a uniﬁed approach to prove
that every 2-connected subcubic graph on n vertices and m edges with girth at least
four or ﬁve, respectively, has an induced forest on at least n − 2
5 m vertices,
respectively, except for ﬁnitely many exceptional graphs. Our results improve a result
of Liu and Zhao and are tight in the sense that the bounds are attained by inﬁnitely
many 2-connected graphs. Equivalently, we prove that such graphs admit feedback
vertex sets with size at most 2
5 m, respectively. Those exceptional graphs will be
explicitly constructed, and our result can be easily modiﬁed to drop the 2-connectivity
requirement.

Introduction

All graphs are simple in this paper. We say that a graph G is subcubic if every vertex of
G has degree at most three. A graph is cubic if every vertex has degree three.

The largest size of an induced subgraph with certain properties in subcubic graphs has
been extensively studied. An immediate corollary of Brooks’ theorem is that every subcubic
graph on n vertices other than K4 contains an independent set of size at least n
3 and an
induced bipartite subgraph of size at least 2n
3 . These easy upper bounds are attained by any
subcubic graph whose vertices can be partitioned into triangles and hence tight. However,
the upper bounds on the size of those induced subgraphs can be signiﬁcantly improved
when triangles are excluded. Staton [10] proved that every triangle-free subcubic graph on
n vertices has an independent set with size least 5n
14 , improving the solution of Fajtlowicz
It was further strengthened
[5] of a conjecture of Albertson, Bollobas and Tucker [1].

by Zhu [12] that all but ﬁnitely many triangle-free subcubic graphs on n vertices have an
induced bipartite subgraph on at least 5n
7 vertices. In addition, it was proved by the second
author and Yu [8] that every subcubic graph other than K3,3 can be partitioned into four
independent sets such that each subgraph induced by any two parts is a disjoint union of
paths. It implies that every subcubic graph on n vertices contains an induced subgraph
that is a linear forest on at least n

2 vertices.

In this paper, we investigate the largest size of an induced subgraph that is a forest,
which is a natural class between induced bipartite subgraphs and induced linear forests and
is closely related to feedback vertex sets, which have been extensively studied. An induced
forest in a graph G is an induced subgraph that is a forest, and we denote the largest size
of an induced forest in G by a(G); a subset S of vertices is a feedback vertex set of G if S
intersects all cycles in G, and we denote the minimum size of a feedback vertex of G by
φ(G). It is easy to see that a(G) + φ(G) = |V (G)|.

We will address the largest size of induced forests in subcubic graphs in this paper.
Study of this parameter on subcubic graphs seems crucial. Problems on subcubic graphs
are already nontrivial and have received much attention, such as Staton and Zhu’s results
mentioned earlier. In addition, for some conjectures about the size of the largest induced
forests, such as a conjecture proposed by Kowalik, Luˇzar and ˇSkrekovski [7] on planar graph
with girth at least ﬁve, the vertex-set of every known graph attaining the conjectured bound
can be partitioned into induced subcubic subgraphs. In fact, the machinery developed in
this paper will be used in one of our follow-up papers [6] about induced forests in planar
graphs.

The study of the largest induced forest in subcubic graphs can be dated to a result of

Bondy, Hopkins and Staton [3].

Theorem 1.1. [3] If G is a connected subcubic graph on n > 4 vertices, then a(G) ≥ 5n
If G is a connected triangle-free subcubic graph, then a(G) ≥ 2n

8 − 1

The ﬁrst bound in Theorem 1.1 is attained by every cubic graph that can be obtained
from a disjoint union of copies of K3 or K +
4 by adding edges so that each added edge is a
cut-edge. In this paper, K +
4 denotes the graph obtained from K4 by subdividing an edge.
And the bound of the second statement in Theorem 1.1 is attained by Q3 and V8, where
Q3 is the 3-dimensional cube and V8 is the non-planar cubic graph on eight vertices with
no K5-minor. See Figure 1.

Zheng and Lu [11] improved the second statement of Theorem 1.1 for cubic graphs by
showing that the additive constant can be removed for all triangle-free cubic graph except
for Q3 and V8. Their result is tight for inﬁnitely many 2-connected graphs, by taking
disjoint copies of L and adding edges. In this paper, L denotes the graph obtained from
K4 by subdividing a perfect matching once. Their result was further improved by Liu and
Zhao [9] as follows.

Theorem 1.2. [9] If G is a connected cubic graph on n vertices of girth at least g, not
K4, Q3, or V8, and if G cannot be obtained from a disjoint union of copies of K3 or K +
4
by adding edges so that each added edge is a cut-edge, then a(G) ≥ 3g−4

4g−4 n − g−3
2g−2 .

Theorem 1.2 is tight for g ∈ {3, 4}, but we will show that it is not tight for g = 5.
It is not hard to see that if a graph is not a disjoint union of cycles, then there exists
an induced forest containing all vertices of degree less than three. So it is reasonable to
expect that the size of the largest induced forest is larger when the graph is not cubic.
Alon, Mubayi and Thomas [2] proved the following.

Theorem 1.3. [2] If G is a subcubic graph on n vertices and m edges and G 6= K4, then
a(G) ≥ n − m
4 , where c is the number of components of G that is a cubic graph and
can be obtained from a disjoint union of copies of K3 or K +
4 by adding edges so that each
added edge is a cut-edge.

4 − c

Note that m ≤ 3n

2 for subcubic graph, so Theorem 1.3 implies the case g = 3 in Theorem
1.2 and hence implies Theorem 1.1, and it also shows that the bound in the case g = 3 of
Theorem 1.2 is only attained by cubic graphs.

We remark that the structure of subcubic and cubic graphs with ﬁxed girth are signif-
icantly diﬀerent. For example, there exists no planar cubic graph with girth at least six,
but planar subcubic graphs can have arbitrary large girth. So Theorem 1.2 does not imply
Theorem 1.3.

In this paper, we will prove the following lower bounds for the size of largest induced
forests for subcubic graphs of girth at least four or ﬁve, respectively, in terms of the number
of vertices and edges.

Theorem 1.4. Let G be a connected subcubic graph on n vertices and m edges.

1. There exists a ﬁnite family S of subcubic but non-cubic graphs such that if G is
triangle-free and G 6∈ {Q3, V8}, then a(G) ≥ n − 2
9 t for
some t ∈ {1, 2} and G is obtained from a disjoint union of 2 − t copies of graphs in
S and copies of L by adding edges such that each added edge is a cut-edge.

G has girth at least ﬁve and G 6∈ {R1, R2}, then a(G) ≥ n − 1

adding edges such that each added edge is a cut-edge.

5 m − 1

The graphs R1, R2 and families S, S ′ will be explicitly described in later sections. See

Theorem 5.3.

Theorem 1.4 is tight in the sense that those bounds are attained by inﬁnitely many
2-connected graphs. Every 2-connected graph obtained from a disjoint union of copies of
L (or R, respectively) by adding edges between diﬀerent copies has girth four (or ﬁve,
respectively) and has no induced forest on more than n − 2
5 m vertices,
respectively), where in this paper R denotes the graph obtained from the Petersen graph
by deleting an edge.
Since m ≤ 3n−k

for subcubic graphs, where k is the number of vertices of degree at
most two, an immediate corollary of Theorem 1.4 generalizes the case g = 4 of Theorem
1.2 to subcubic graphs and improves the case g = 5 of Theorem 1.2.

and G is obtained from a disjoint union of copies of graphs in S ′ by adding edges

In fact, we will prove Theorem 4.3, which is a stronger version of Theorem 1.4 (and
hence of Corollary 1.5), in which we allow cycles with length less than four or ﬁve as long
as they are not disjoint. However, there are more exceptional graphs than Theorem 1.4
should be considered if we allow cycles with less than four or ﬁve. In order to obtain a clean
and simple statement, we will introduce an error function that takes non-zero values only
when the graphs are exceptional. In addition, introducing the error function also provides
us a way to give a uniﬁed proof for the case of girth four and ﬁve. But the formal deﬁnition
of this error function is involved, so we postpone its formal deﬁnition and the statement of
Theorem 4.3 until Section 4.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will describe two basic operations
that will be used for constructing the families S, S ′ mentioned in Theorem 1.4 and show
that the graphs that can be constructed by these two operations have a large induced
forest with certain strong properties. These strong properties are important in the proof
of Theorem 4.3.
In Section 3, we will investigate the structure of the graphs that are
constructed by the two basic operations mentioned earlier. We will state Theorem 4.3
and deﬁne the error function in Section 4. We will also prove that Theorem 4.3 holds for
graphs constructed by the two basic operations in a stronger sense in Section 4, which will

4

be used in Section 7 and whose proof provides the intuition of the deﬁnition of the error
functions. In Section 5, we will compute the values of the error function and show how to
derive Theorem 1.4 from Theorem 4.3. The understanding of explicit values of the error
function is another crucial step for proving Theorem 4.3. In Section 6, we will provide a
suﬃcient and necessary condition for a cubic graph being the dodecahedron. It is easy to
see that the dodecahedron satisﬁes Theorem 4.3. The strategy for proving Theorem 4.3 is
to obtain a contradiction by showing that every minimum counterexample of Theorem 4.3
must satisfy the suﬃcient and necessary condition and hence is the dodecahedron. This
characterization for the dodecahedron might be of independent interest. Finally, we prove
Theorem 4.3 in Section 7.

We remark that since a(G) + φ(G) = |V (G)| for all graphs G, the bound mentioned in
Theorems 1.4 and 4.3 can be more simply stated if we consider feedback vertex sets. So in
the rest of the paper, we will investigate the minimum size of feedback vertex sets instead
of the largest size of induced forests.

To complete this section, we deﬁne some notations and notions that will be frequently
used in this paper. If X is a subset of V (G) of a graph G, then G[X] denotes the subgraph
of G induced by X, and G − X denotes the subgraph induced by V (G) − X. When X
consists of one vertex, say v, then we also write G − X as G − v.
If x, y is a pair of
non-adjacent vertices of G, then G + xy is the graph obtained from G by adding the edge
xy. A vertex v in a graph G is a cut-vertex if G − v has more connected components than
G. Similarly, an edge e in a graph G is a cut-edge if G − e has more connected components
than G. A block of a graph is a maximal connected subgraph without a cut-vertex. We say
that a block is nontrivial if it is not isomorphic to K1 or K2. Note that in any subcubic
graph, every pair of nontrivial blocks is disjoint. An end-block of a graph G is a block
containing at most one cut-vertex of G. Observe that every graph that is not 2-connected
contains at least two end-blocks.

2 Basic operations

The special families of graphs mentioned in Theorem 1.4 will be constructed by two basic
operations. This section addresses the relationship between the size of feedback vertex sets
in the graph and in the graph obtained by these operations. These results will be used in
follow-up sections.

The ﬁrst operation is subdividing an edge once.

Lemma 2.1. Let H be a graph, k ∈ {0, 1}, and let G be the graph obtained from H by
subdividing an edge. If there exists p ∈ R such that φ(H − W ) ≤ p for every W ⊆ E(H)
with |W | = k, then φ(G − W ′) ≤ p for every W ′ ⊆ E(G) with |W ′| = k.

Proof. Suppose G is obtained from H by subdividing an edge e. Say v is the new vertex,
and e1 and e2 are the new edges. If W ′ ⊆ E(H)−{e}, then every minimum feedback vertex

5

set of H − W ′ is a feedback vertex set of G − W ′ with size φ(H − W ′). If W ′ ⊆ {e1, e2},
then every minimum feedback vertex of H − e is a feedback vertex set of G − W ′ with size
φ(H − e). This proves the lemma.

Now we deﬁne the second operation. Let G be a graph. For e1, e2 ∈ E(G) (not
necessarily distinct) and a ∈ V (G) with degree two, we deﬁne G ◦ (e1, e2, a) to be the graph
obtained from G by subdividing e1 and e2 once, respectively, and adding a new vertex
adjacent to a and the two vertices obtained from subdividing e1 and e2. Note that when
e1 = e2, it is subdivided twice.

Lemma 2.2. Let H be a graph, k ∈ {0, 1}, a ∈ V (H), e1, e2 ∈ E(H), and G = H ◦
If there exists p ∈ R such that φ(H − W ) ≤ p for every W ⊆ E(H) with
(e1, e2, a).
|W | = k, then φ(G − W ′) ≤ p + 1 for every W ′ ⊆ E(G) with |W ′| = k.

Proof. Let v1, v2 be the new vertices obtained by subdividing edges e1, e2, respectively, and
let v be the vertex in V (G) − (V (H) ∪ {v1, v2}). If W ′ ⊆ E(H), then adding v into any
minimum feedback vertex set of H − W ′ is a feedback vertex set of G − W ′, as desired. So
to prove this lemma, it suﬃces to prove the case when W ′ 6⊆ E(H). In particular, |W ′| = 1.
Let e be the edge in W ′. Suppose e is incident with v. By symmetry, we may assume
without loss of generality that v is not incident to v2. Then adding v2 into any minimum
feedback vertex set of H − e2 is a feedback vertex set of G − W ′ of size φ(H − e2) + 1,
as desired. Therefore we may assume e is not incident with v. By symmetry, we may
assume without loss of generality that e is incident with v2 and not v1. Then adding v
into any minimum feedback vertex set of H − e2 is a feedback vertex set of G − W ′ of size
φ(H − e2) + 1, as desired.

Lemma 2.3. Let G be a graph. If e ∈ E(G), then for every v ∈ V (G) incident with e,
φ(G − v) ≤ φ(G − e).

Proof. Let v ∈ V (G) be incident with e. Let S be a feedback vertex set of G − e of size
φ(G − e). Then S is a feedback vertex set of G − v, so φ(G − v) ≤ φ(G − e), as desired.

3 Special families of graphs

In this section we introduce the special families of graphs in order to formally state Theorem
4.3.

Let C1 be the multigraph on one vertex with one loop. Deﬁne F1,0 = {C1} and deﬁne
Fi,j = ∅ if i ≤ 0 or j < 0. For 0 ≤ j ≤ i, we deﬁne Fi,j to be the set of subcubic multigraphs
that can be either obtained from a multigraph in Fi−1,j by subdividing an edge once or
obtained from a graph in Fi,j−1 by taking operation ◦.

Note that every graph in Fi,j has minimum degree at least two for every i, j. Since the
operation ◦ decreases the number of vertices of degree two, for every i, j, Fi,j has exactly
i − j vertices of degree two. Hence a graph in Fi,j is cubic if and only if i = j.

6

By suppressing a vertex of degree two of a graph, we mean that contracting an edge
incident with it. The following lemma simpliﬁes the process of generating the family Fi,j.

Lemma 3.1. Let i, j be integers with i ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ j ≤ i. If H ∈ Fi,j has at least two
vertices and v is a vertex of H of degree two, then i + j ≥ 2, i − 1 ≥ j, and the multigraph
obtained from H by suppressing v belongs to Fi−1,j.

In particular, if i − 1 ≥ j, then every multigraph in Fi,j can be obtained from a multi-

graph in Fi−1,j by subdividing an edge.

Proof. Note that i > j, or else H is cubic, and i + j ≥ 2, or else H is the loop. We shall
prove this lemma by induction on i+ j. When j = 0, it is clear that H is the cycle of length
i. Since H has at least two vertices, i ≥ 2, so suppressing v leads to a cycle of length i − 1,
which belongs to Fi−1,j. This proves the base case.

Now assume j ≥ 1. We ﬁrst assume that H is obtained from a multigraph H1 ∈ Fi−1,j
by subdividing an edge e. By the induction hypothesis, suppressing v in H1 leads to a
multigraph H2 in Fi−2,j. Then the graph obtained from H by suppressing v is the graph
obtained from H2 by subdividing the edge e and hence belonging to Fi−1,j.

So we may assume that H is obtained from a multigraph H3 ∈ Fi,j−1 by taking the
operation ◦. By the induction hypothesis, suppressing v in H3 leads to a multigraph H4
in Fi−1,j−1. Then the graph obtained from H by suppressing v is the graph obtained from
H4 by taking the operation ◦.

Bearing Lemma 3.1 in mind, the following lemma can be easily veriﬁed.

Lemma 3.2. Let i, j be integers with i ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ j ≤ i. The following holds.

1. Fi,0 consists of the cycle of length i.

2. All members of Fi,j are simple, unless i ∈ {1, 2} and j = 0.

3. F1,1 = {K4}.

4. F2,1 = {K +

4 }.

5. |F3,1| = 3; every graph in F3,1 can be obtained from K +

4 by subdividing an edge; L is
the only graph in F3,1 with girth at least four. If H ∈ F3,1 and e ∈ E(H), then H − e
has girth at most four.

6. Every graph in F2,2 contains disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve; every graph in

F2,2 − {Q3, V8} contains a triangle disjoint from a cycle of length at most four.

7. Every graph in F3,2 ∪ F4,1 has girth at most four.

8. If G ∈ Fi,j, then |V (G)| = i + 3j and |E(G)| = i + 5j.

R1

Figure 2: The girth ﬁve graphs in F3,3

Recall that R is the graph obtained from the Petersen graph by deleting an edge. Note
that R has girth ﬁve and can be obtained from V8 by subdividing the edges in a matching
of size 2, so R ∈ F4,2.

Lemma 3.3. If G is a member of F4,j with girth at least ﬁve, then j ≥ 2. Furthermore,
R is the only member of F4,2 with girth at least ﬁve.

Proof. By Lemma 3.2, j ≥ 2. Now we assume j = 2. By Lemma 3.1, G can be obtained
from a graph H2 ∈ F2,2 by subdividing two edges, not necessarily distinct. By Lemma 3.2,
H2 is isomorphic to Q3 or V8, or H2 contains a triangle disjoint from a cycle of length at
most four. Since G has girth at least ﬁve, H2 is isomorphic to V8. It is not hard to see that
R is the unique graph with girth at least ﬁve that can be obtained from V8 by subdividing
two edges.

We deﬁne R1 and R2 to be the graphs depicted in Figure 2. They can obtained from
Q3 and V8 respectively by subdividing an edge and applying operation ◦, so R1, R2 ∈ F3,3.

Lemma 3.4. If G ∈ F3,j has girth at least ﬁve, then j = 3 and G is isomorphic to R1 or
R2.

Proof. By Lemma 3.2, j = 3, Therefore G is a cubic graph on twelve vertices. It is known
that there are there are only two cubic graphs on twelve vertices with girth at least ﬁve.
(See [4], page 8.) So there are at most two graphs in F3,3 having girth at least ﬁve. It
is easy to see that R1, R2 are non-isomorphic graph with girth ﬁve. Hence they are the
graphs in F3,3 with girth at least ﬁve.

For integers i, j, k with i ≥ 1, 0 ≤ j ≤ i and k ≥ 0, deﬁne F 4

i,j,k to be the set of 2-
connected subcubic multigraphs obtained from k disjoint copies of L and a copy of a graph
Fi,j by adding k + 1 edges; deﬁne F 5
i,j,k to be the set of 2-connected subcubic multigraphs
obtained from k disjoint copies of R and a copy of a graph Fi,j by adding k + 1 edges. Note
that when k ≥ 1, each added edge must have ends in diﬀerent copies; when k = 0, every
member of F 4
i,j,k is obtained from a graph in Fi,j by adding an edge. Observe that
F g
i,j,k is nonempty only when i − j ≥ 2 since each its member is subcubic. Since K3,3 can
be obtained from L by adding an edge and L ∈ F3,1, we know K3,3 ∈ F 4

5 . We need the following Lemmas to ensure the error functions

Lemma 4.1. Let g ∈ {4, 5}. If G ∈ F g
k ≥ 0, 1 ≤ i′ ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ j′ ≤ i′, then 1 − tg + j(1 − 5tg) − itg = 1 + j′(1 − 5tg) − i′tg.

3,j,k ∩ Fi′,j′ for some integers j, k, i′j′ with 0 ≤ j ≤ 3,

Proof. Suppose to the contrary that there exist nonnegative integers j, k, i′, j′′ with 1 ≤
i′ ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ j′ ≤ i′ such that F g
Suppose j = 0. Since G ∈ F g

3,j,k ∩ Fi′,j′ is nonempty. Note that 0 ≤ j ≤ 1.
3,0,k, G contains a triangle that contains a vertex v of
degree two in G. So i′ − j′ ≥ 1. By Lemma 3.1, the mulitgraph G′ obtained from G by
suppressing v belongs to Fi′−1,j′. But G′ is not simple, so (i′, j′) = (2, 0) or (3, 0). However,
every member of F g
3,0,k has more than three edges, a contradiction. So j = 1, and hence G
is cubic. This implies that i′ = j′.

Suppose that g = 4. Since G ∈ F 4

3,1,k, |V (G)| = 6k + 6 and |E(G)| = 8k + 8 + (k + 1) =
9k + 9. But G ∈ Fi′,i′, so 6k + 6 = 4i′ and 9k + 9 = 6i′. Hence, 3k + 3 = 2i′. But i′ ≤ 4,
so k = 1 and i′ = 3. Then 1 − tg + j(1 − 5tg) − itg = 1 + j′(1 − 5tg) − i′tg.

So g = 5. Since G ∈ F 5

3,1,k, |V (G)| = 10k + 6 and |E(G)| = 14k + 8 + (k + 1) = 15k + 9.
But G ∈ Fi′,i′, so 10k + 6 = 4i′ and 15k + 9 = 6i′. That is, 5k + 3 = 2i′. Since 1 ≤ i′ ≤ 4,
k = 1 and i′ = 4. Then 1 − tg + j(1 − 5tg) − itg = 1 + j′(1 − 5tg) − i′tg.

Lemma 4.2. Let g ∈ {4, 5}. If G ∈ F g
0 ≤ j ≤ i, k ≥ 0, 1 ≤ i′ ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ j′ ≤ i′, then

i,j,k ∩ Fi′,j′ for some integers i, j, k, i′j′ with i ≥ 0,

max{1 − tg + j(1 − 5tg) − itg, 0} = max{1 + j′(1 − 5tg) − i′tg, 0}.

Proof. Let x = max{1 − tg + j(1 − 5tg) − itg, 0} and y = max{1 + j′(1 − 5tg) − i′tg, 0}. If
k = 0, then by comparing the number of vertices and edges of the graphs in F g
i,j,0 and Fi′,j′,
we obtain that i′ + 3j′ = i + 3j and i′ + 5j′ = i + 5j + 1, which implies that 2j′ = 2j + 1,
a contradiction. So k ≥ 1.

Recall that F g

i,j,k 6= ∅ only when i − j ≥ 2. If i = 2, then j = 0 and every graph in
i,j,k has a pair of parallel edges, so (i′, j′) = (2, 0), but then i′ + 5j′ = 2 < 10. So i ≥ 3.

F g
Furthermore, if i = 3, then x = y by Lemma 4.1. Therefore, i ≥ 4.

We ﬁrst assume g = 4. Then x = max{ 7−2i−j

, 0}. Since
k ≥ 1 and G ∈ F g
i,j,k, |E(G)| ≥ i + 5j + 10; since G ∈ Fi′,j′, |E(G)| = i′ + 5j′. As i ≥ 4, we
know i′ + 5j′ ≥ 14 + 5j ≥ 14. So either i′ ≥ 5, or i′ = 4 and j′ ≥ 2, or i′ = 3 and j′ ≥ 3.
In any case, y = 0 and x = 0.

, 0}, and y = max{ 9−2i′−j′

So we may assume g = 5. Then x = max{ 4−i

5 , 0}. Since k = 1,
|E(G)| ≥ i + 5j + 16 = 5j + 20. So i′ + 5j′ ≥ 5j + 20. Hence either i′ ≥ 5, or i′ = j′ = 4
and j = 0. But when i ≥ 4, j = 0, every graph in F g
i,j,k is not cubic, but every graph in
F4,4 is. So i′ ≥ 5 and hence x = y = 0.

Note that ǫ(B) is well-deﬁned by Lemma 4.2.

Theorem 4.3 is the main theorem in this paper. It will be proved in Section 7.

Theorem 4.3. Let g ∈ {4, 5}. If G is a subcubic graph with no two disjoint cycles with
length less than g, then φ(G) ≤ tg|E(G)| + rg(G).

To close this section, we prove that Theorem 4.3 holds for graphs in Fi,j for all non-
negative integers i, j in a stronger sense, which will be used in Section 7. The proof also
provides the intuition of the deﬁnition of the functions ǫg.

Lemma 4.4. Let g ∈ {4, 5}. If G ∈ Fi,j for some nonnegative integers i, j with j ≤ i,
then φ(G − e) ≤ tg|E(G)| + ǫg(G) − 1 for every edge e ∈ E(G).

Proof. We shall prove this lemma by induction on i + j. When j = 0, G is a cycle of length
i, so φ(G − e) = 0 = tg|E(G)| − 1 + ǫg(G). This prove the base case. Therefore we may
assume that the lemma holds for all graphs in Fi′,j′ with i′ + j′ < i + j or j′ = 0.

We ﬁrst assume that there exists a multigraph H in Fi−1,j such that G is obtained from
H by subdividing an edge. By the induction hypothesis, φ(H − f ) ≤ tg|E(H)| + ǫg(H) − 1
for every f ∈ E(H). By Lemma 2.1, for every e ∈ E(G),

φ(G − e) ≤ tg|E(H)| + ǫg(H) − 1 ≤ tg(|E(G)| − 1) + (ǫg(G) + tg) − 1 = tg|E(G)| + ǫg(G) − 1,

as desired.

So we may assume that there exists a multigraph H ′ in Fi,j−1 such that G is obtained
from H ′ by taking the operation ◦. By the induction hypothesis, φ(H ′ − f ) ≤ tg|E(H ′)| +
ǫg(H ′) − 1 for every f ∈ E(H ′). By Lemma 2.2, for every e ∈ E(G),

φ(G − e) ≤ tg|E(H ′)| + ǫg(H ′) ≤ tg(|E(G)| − 5) + (ǫg (G) + 5tg − 1) = tg|E(G)| + ǫg(G) − 1,

as desired.

Lemma 4.5. Let g ∈ {4, 5}, and let i, j, k be nonnegative integers with j ≤ i and k ≥ 1.
If G ∈ Fi,j ∪ F g
i,j,k, then for all v ∈ V (G), G admits a feedback vertex set S of size at most
tg|E(G)| + ǫg(G) that contains v.

10

Proof. We ﬁrst assume that G ∈ Fi,j. By Lemmas 2.3 and 4.4, φ(G − v) ≤ tg|E(G)| +
ǫg(G) − 1. So G − v admits a feedback vertex set S of size at most tg|E(G)| + ǫg(G) − 1.
Hence, S ∪ {v} is a feedback vertex set of G of size at most tg|E(G)| + ǫg(G).

Hence we may assume that G ∈ F g

i,j,k. So there exist a multigraph H0 ∈ Fi,j and graphs
H1, . . . , Hk each isomorphic to L if g = 4 (and isomorphic to R if g = 5, respectively) such
that G is obtained from the disjoint union of H0, . . . , Hk by adding k + 1 edges. Since
k ≥ 1, there is some index p such that v /∈ V (Hp). Choose u ∈ V (Hp) such that u is
adjacent to a vertex in V (G) − V (Hp). Recall that L and R are members of Si′,j′ Fi′,j′. It
is easy to see that ǫ4(L) = t4 and ǫ5(R) = t5. By Statement 1, for each ℓ with 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ k,
Hℓ admits a feedback vertex set Sℓ of size at most tg|E(Hℓ)| + ǫg(Hℓ) such that u ∈ Sp and
v ∈ Sℓ for some ℓ. Then Sk

ℓ=0 Sℓ is a feedback vertex set of G with size at most

k

(tg|E(Hℓ)|+ǫg(Hℓ)) = tg(|E(G)|−k−1)+ǫg (H0)+ktg = tg|E(G)|+max{1+j(1−5tg )−itg, 0}−tg

X

ℓ=0

≤ tg|E(G)| + max{1 − tg + j(1 − 5tg) − itg, 0} = tg|E(G)| + ǫg(G).

This completes the proof.

The following lemmas describe the values of the functions r4, r5 for graphs with no two

disjoint short cycles.

Lemma 5.1. If G is a connected subcubic graph with no two disjoint triangles, then one
of the following holds.

1. G ∈ {K3, K4, K +

4 } ∪ F2,2.

2. r4(G) = 4

9 , and G is obtained from a disjoint union of a copy of K +

4 and at least one

copy of L by adding edges such that each new edge is a cut-edge.

11

3. r4(G) = 1

3 , and either G is obtained from a disjoint union of a copy of K +

4 , a graph
in F3,2 ∪ F4,0 and copies of L by adding edges such that each new edge is a cut-edge,
or G is obtained from a disjoint union of K3 and at least one copy of L by adding
edges such that each new edge is a cut-edge.

4. r4(G) = 2

9 , and either some block of G is isomorphic to K +

4 or K3, or G is obtained
from a disjoint union of copies of graphs in F3,1 by adding edges such that each new
edge is a cut-edge.

5. r4(G) = 1

9 , and either some block of G isomorphic to K +

from a graph in F3,2 ∪ F4,0 ∪ Sk≥1 F 4
edges such that each new edge is a cut-edge.

3,0,k and copies of members of F3,1 by adding

6. r4(G) ≤ 0.

Proof. We shall prove this lemma by induction on |V (G)|. We are done if G ∈ {K3, K4, K +
F2,2. This proves the induction basis and we may assume that G has at least two vertices
and G 6∈ {K3, K4, K +

4 }∪

4 } ∪ F2,2.
We ﬁrst assume that K +

4 is an end-block of G. Since G does not contain two disjoint
triangles, there uniquely exists an end-block B isomorphic to K +
4 , and G − V (B) has
no triangle. Note that G 6= B, so G − V (B) is nonempty and does not contain K +

of degree at most two, so r4(G − V (B)) ≤ 2
9 by the induction hypothesis. Note that
r4(G) = r4(G − V (B)) − 2

In addition, G − V (B) 6∈ {K3, K4, K +

9 + ǫ4(B) = r4(G − V (B)) + 2
9 .

9 , then r4(G) = 4

If r4(G − V (B)) = 2

9 , and by the induction hypothesis, G − V (B) is
obtained from a disjoint union of copies of graphs in F3,1 by adding edges such that each
new edge is a cut-edge. Since G − V (B) does not contain a triangle, the chosen member
in F3,1 must be L, by Lemma 3.2. So Statement 2 holds.
9 , then
r4(G) = 1
3 , and by the induction hypothesis, since G − V (B) is triangle-free, G − V (B) can
be obtained from a graph in F3,2 ∪ F4,0 and copies of L by adding edges such that each
new edge is a cut-edge. Then Statement 3 holds. If r4(G − V (B)) = 0, then r4(G) = 2
9
and K +

4 is an end-block of G, so Statement 4 holds.

If r4(G − V (B)) = 1

Hence we may assume that K +
4

If G has a leaf v, then
r4(G) = r4(G − v) − 2
3 and G − v does
not contain K +
3 , so G − v (and hence G)
contains K3 as a block by the induction hypothesis, and Statement 5 holds. If r4(G) < 1
9 ,
then Statement 6 holds.

9 by the induction hypothesis, since r4(K3) ≤ 1

4 as an end-block. If r4(G) = 1

9 , then r4(G − v) = 1

is not an end-block of G.

9 ≤ 1

So we may assume that G has minimum degree at least two. Since G 6= K3, G has
a nontrivial end-block B′ that is not isomorphic to K3. By the induction hypothesis,
r4(G − V (B′)) ≤ 1
4 . Furthermore,
since B is triangle-free, 0 ≤ r4(B) ≤ 2
Assume that r4(G − V (B)) = 1

9 . Hence r4(G) = r4(B) − 2
3 . Then by the induction hypothesis, G − V (B) is
obtained from a disjoint union of K3 and copies of L by adding edges such that each added

9 , then B ∈ F3,1 by induction, but then B = L by Lemma 3.2, so r4(G) = 1

edge is a cut-edge. In particular, B is triangle-free since G has no two disjoint triangles. If
r4(B) = 2
3 and G
is obtained from a disjoint union of K3 and at least one copy of L by adding edges such that
9 . If r4(B) = 1
each added edge is a cut-edge. Hence Statement 3 holds when r4(B) = 2
9 ,
then r4(G) = 2
9 and G contains K3 as a block, so Statement 4 holds. If r4(B) = 0, then
r4(G) = 1

9 and G contains K3 as a block, so Statement 5 holds.

Therefore, we may assume r4(G − V (B)) ≤ 2

3 ≤ r4(G − V (B)) + r4(B) ≤ 4

9 . We may assume Statement 6 does not

hold, so 1

and B ∈ F3,1, and either G − V (B) (and hence G) contains K3 as a block, or G − V (B)
(and hence G) can be obtained from a disjoint union of copies of graphs in F3,1 by adding
edges such that each new edge is a cut-edge.

9 . If r4(G − V (B)) = r4(B) = 2

So we may assume that r4(G − V (B)) + r4(B) = 1

9 . We may
further assume that no block of G is isomorphic to K +
4 or K3, otherwise Statement 5 holds.
If r4(G − V (B)) = 2
9 , then by the induction hypothesis, G − V (B) can be
obtained from a disjoint union of copies of members of F3,1 by adding edges such that
each new edge is a cut-edge, and B ∈ F3,2 ∪ F4,0 ∪ Sk≥1 F 4
3,0,k, so Statement 5 holds. If
r4(G−V (B)) = 1
9 , then Statement 5 also holds by the induction hypothesis.
This completes the proof.

9 and r4(B) = 1

9 and r4(B) = 2

Lemma 5.2. If G is a connected subcubic graph with no two disjoint cycles of length less
than ﬁve, then one of the following holds.

1. G = K4 or G contains K +

4 as a subgraph.

2. r5(G) = 2

5 and G is obtained from a disjoint union of a graph in S3

j=0 F3,j and copies

3,0,k by adding edges between diﬀerent

j=0 F4,j ∪ Sk≥0 F 5

graphs such that each new edge is a cut-edge in G.

4. r5(G) ≤ 0.

Proof. By Lemma 3.2, no block of G is isomorphic to a graph in F2,2. Assume that G is
2-connected. Since G 6∈ {K4, K +
5 , then G ∈ F3,j
for some j ≥ 0, since F 5
2,j,k does not contain simple graphs for any nonnegative integers
j, k; if r5(G) = 1
5 , then G ∈ F 5
3,j,k ∪ F4,j for some nonnegative integers j ≤ 1, k. So this
lemma holds if G is 2-connected.

4 }, r5(G) = ǫ5(G) ≤ 2

5 . And if r5(G) = 2

We shall prove this lemma by induction on |V (G)|. The induction basis was proved
by the 2-connected case. We assume that this lemma holds for every connected subcubic

13

graph on fewer vertices with no two disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve. We may also
assume that G 6= K4 and G does not contain K +

F3,3. So we may assume that G has minimum degree at least two.

Assume that G contains a leaf v. Then by the induction hypothesis, r5(G) = r5(G −

5 and hence G contains a graph
j=0 F3,j as a block. Note that that block is not cubic and hence does not belong to
Since every member of S2

Lemma 3.2, G contains a nontrivial end-block B not isomorphic to a graph in S2
F3,j). Since G is not 2-connected, B is not cubic and hence not in F3,3. So r5(B) ≤ 1
the induction hypothesis. Hence r5(G) = r5(B) − 1
the induction hypothesis, r5(G) ≤ 2

j=0(F2,j ∪ F3,j) contains a cycle of length less than ﬁve by
j=0(F2,j ∪

5 + r5(G − V (B)) ≤ r5(G − V (B)). By

5 , then r5(B) = 1

Furthermore, if r5(G) = 2

is not cubic, G − V (B) is obtained from a disjoint union of a member in S2
copies of members of S3
new edge is a cut-edge. Note that every graph in S2
has girth at least ﬁve. Since B is 2-connected with r5(B) = 1

j=0 F4,j by adding edges between diﬀerent graphs such that each

that each new edge is a cut-edge in G − V (B). Since B is 2-connected but not subcubic,
3,0,k. Therefore, G is obtained from a disjoint union of copies of

each new edge is a cut-edge in G. This proves the lemma.

The following is the explicit form of Theorem 1.4.

Theorem 5.3. Let G be a connected subcubic graph on n vertices and m edges.

1. If G has girth at least four, then one of the following holds.

(a) G ∈ {Q3, V8} and φ(G) = 2
(b) G is obtained from a disjoint union of copies of L by adding edges such that

9 m + 1

each new edge is a cut-edge, and φ(G) = 2

9 m + 2
9 .

(c) G is obtained from a disjoint union of a member of F3,2 ∪ F4,0 and copies of L

by adding edges such that each new edge is a cut-edge, and φ(G) = 2

9 m + 1
9 .

14

(d) φ(G) ≤ 2

9 m.

2. If G has girth at least ﬁve, then one of the following holds.

(a) G ∈ {R1, R2} and φ(G) = 1
(b) G ∈ F4,4 or can be obtained from a disjoint union of members of {R} ∪ F4,3
with girth at least ﬁve by adding edges such that each new edge is a cut-edge,
and φ(G) ≤ 1

5 m + 2
5 .

5 m + 1
5 .

(c) φ(G) ≤ 1

5 m.

Proof. We ﬁrst assume that G has girth at least four. It is straight forward to compute
φ(G) if G ∈ {Q3, V8} or can be obtained from a disjoint union of at most one graph in
F3,2 ∪ F4,0 and copies of L by adding edges such that each added edge is a cut-edge. So
we assume that G is not of those cases, and we shall prove that φ(G) ≤ 2
9 m. Since G
has girth at least four, G does not contain K3, K4 or K +
4 as a subgraph. By Lemma
3.2, G 6∈ F2,2, otherwise G ∈ {Q3, V8}. In addition, if G contains a member of F3,1 as a
subgraph, then this member must be L by Lemma 3.2. Therefore, by Theorem 4.3 and
Lemma 5.1, φ(G) ≤ 2

9 . This proves the ﬁrst statement.

9 m + 1

5 m + 2

4 or members of S2

5 , then G ∈ {R1, R2}. And it is straight forward to see φ(G) = m

Now we assume that G has girth at least ﬁve and prove the second statement. By
Lemma 3.2, G does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to K4, K +
j=0(F3,j∪
3,j,k) ∪ F4,0 ∪ F4,1. Since every graph in F3,3 is cubic, by Lemma 5.2, if r5(G) = 2
Sk≥0 F 5
5 ,
then G ∈ F3,3. But Lemma 3.4 implies that G ∈ {R1, R2}. Hence, by Theorem 4.3, if
φ(G) ≥ 1
5 + 2
5
if G ∈ {R1, R2}. If r5(G) = 1
5 , then by Lemma 5.2, G can be obtained from a disjoint
union of copies of members of S4
j=2 F4,j by adding edges such that each added edge is a
cut-edge. By Lemma 3.3, R is the only graph with girth at least ﬁve in F4,2. Note that
every graph in F4,4 is cubic, so if G contains F4,4 as a subgraph, then G ∈ F4,4. Hence,
together with Theorem 4.3, if φ(G) = 1
5 , then G ∈ F4,4 or is obtained from a disjoint
union of members of {R} ∪ F4,3 by adding edges such that each added edge is a cut-edge.
This proves the second statement.

5 m + 1

6 A characterization of the dodecahedron

We shall prove a characterization of the dodecahedron in this section. It is of independent
interest and will be used in Section 7 for the proof of Theorem 4.3.

Theorem 6.1. A cubic graph G is a disjoint union of copies of dodecahedra if and only if
it has girth ﬁve and for every vertex v of G and for every pair of neighbors a, b of v, G − v
contains two disjoint 5-cycles, where one contains a and the other contains b.

Proof. It is clear that if G is a disjoint union of copies of dodecahedra, then for every vertex
v of G and for every pair of neighbors a, b of v, G − v contains two disjoint 5-cycles, where

15

one contains a and the other contains b. It suﬃces to prove the converse statement. So we
assume that for every vertex v of G and for every pair of neighbors a, b of v, G − v contains
two disjoint 5-cycles, where one contains a and the other contains b.

We ﬁrst claim that G does not have two 5-cycles sharing two edges. Since G has girth
at least ﬁve, no two 5-cycles can share more than two edges, and the shared edges must
have a common end. Suppose to the contrary that there are two 5-cycles in G sharing
sharing two edges, say av and vb. Let a1 and a2 be the neighbors of a other than v, and
let b1 and b2 be the neighbors of b other than v. We can assume without loss of generality
that a1 is adjacent to b1 and a2 is adjacent to b2.

By assumption, G − v contains two disjoint 5-cycles D1 and D2, where D1 contains
a1aa2 and D2 contains b1bb2. Let D1 = aa1a′
2b2b. Let c be the
neighbor of v other than a and b. By assumption, G − a contains disjoint 5-cycles D′
1
and D′
2 are disjoint,
b2 ∈ V (D′
2). Since G has girth at least 5, c is not adjacent to a2. Therefore c is adjacent
to b′
2.
Again by assumption, G−a contains disjoint 5-cycles D′′

2 contains cvb. Since D′

2a2a and D2 = bb1b′

2 such that D′

1a1b1 and D′

1 contains a′

1 and D′

1a′

1b′

2a2b2 and D′′
a′
not adjacent to a1, so c is adjacent to b′
This proves that G does not contain two 5-cycles sharing two edges.

2 contains cvb. Therefore c, v, b, b1 ∈ V (D′′
1b′

1. But then cb′

1 and D′′

2 such that D′′

1 contains
2 ). Since G has girth at least 5, c is
2c is a triangle in G, a contradiction.

Now we claim that every edge of G is contained in precisely two 5-cycles. Let xy ∈ E(G).
Let x1 and x2 be the neighbors of x other than y. By assumption, there is a 5-cycle in
G − x1, and hence in G, containing xy. Suppose that G contains three 5-cycles Z1, Z2, Z3
containing xy. Without loss of generality, we may assume that Z1 contains x1xy. Since no
two 5-cycles can share two edges, Z2 and Z3 do not contain x1x. So Z2 and Z3 contain both
xx2 and xy, a contradiction. This proves that every edge of G is contained in precisely two
5-cycles.

Since every edge is contained in precisely two 5-cycles and G has an edge, G contains a
5-cycle, say C = v0v1v2v3v4v0. For integers i with 0 ≤ i ≤ 4, let v′
i be the neighbor vi not
in C. Since G has girth at least ﬁve, v′
j for i 6= j. For each i with 0 ≤ i ≤ 4, vivi+1
is contained in precisely two 5-cycles (where indices are computed modulo 5), so vivi+1 is
contained in a 5-cycle Ui such that E(C) ∩ E(Ui) = {vivi+1}. Therefore v′
i+1 ∈ V (Ui),
and there is a vertex wi /∈ {vi : 0 ≤ i ≤ 4} adjacent to both v′
i+1. Suppose wi = wj
for i 6= j. Since G is cubic, |i − j| = 1. But then |E(Ui) ∩ E(Uj)| = 2, a contradiction. So
wi for 0 ≤ i ≤ 4 are pairwise distinct.

i and v′

i 6= v′

i, v′

i be the neighbor of wi not in Ui. Clearly w′
iwi is contained in precisely two 5-cycles, there exists a 5-cycle U ′

Let w′

j. Since v′

E(Ui) ∩ E(U ′
i−1 is adjacent to w′
i.
So w′
i−1 6= w′
i+1)| ≥ 2, a contradiction. Since G is cubic, the
component of G containing C has no more vertices, so the component of G containing C
is the dodecahedron.

i ) = {v′
i+1, otherwise |E(U ′

i is distinct from vj and v′

iwi}. Therefore U ′

i contains wi−1v′

i ) ∩ E(U ′

i, so w′

iwiw′

Note that C is a 5-cycle that contains an arbitrary edge of G we picked at the begin-

16

ning. Since G is cubic, every component of G has an edge, so every component of G is a
dodecahedron. This completes the proof.

7 Proof of Theorem 4.3

This section dedicates the proof of Theorem 4.3. We shall prove Theorem 4.3 by induction
on |V (G)|. It is easy to see that Theorem 4.3 holds for graphs with at most two vertices.
For g ∈ {4, 5}, we say that a graph G is g-minimal if G is a subcubic graph that does
not contain two disjoint cycles of length less than g and φ(G) > tg|E(G)| + rg(G), but
φ(H) ≤ tg|E(H)| + rg(H) for every subcubic graph H with fewer vertices than G but not
containing two disjoint cycles of length less than g. In other words, g-minimal graphs are
the minimum counterexamples of Theorem 4.3. Note that every g-minimal graph contains
i,j,k by Lemma

at least three vertices and does not belong to Si≥1,i≥j≥0 Fi,j ∪ Si≥1,j,k≥0 F g

4.5.

In the rest of this section, g ∈ {4, 5} and G is a g-minimal graph. We denote |V (G)|

and |E(G)| by n and m, respectively.

Lemma 7.1. G is 2-connected.

Proof. It is easy to see that every g-minimal graph is connected, so G is connected.

Suppose that G has a leaf v. By the minimality of G, G − v admits a feedback vertex
set S of size at most tg(m − 1) + rg(G − v) = tgm + rg(G). But S is a feedback vertex set
of G, a contradiction. Therefore G has minimum degree at least two.

If G is not 2-connected, then G contains a nontrivial end-block B. Since G is subcubic,
there exists an cut-edge of G incident with B. By the minimality of G, B admits a feedback
vertex set SB of size at most tg|E(B)| + ǫg(B), and G − V (B) admits a feedback vertex set
S′
B of size at most tg (m − |E(B)| − 1) + rg(G − V (B)). But SB ∪ S′
B is a feedback vertex
set of G of size at most tgm + rg(G − V (B)) + ǫg(B) − tg = tgm + rg(G), a contradiction.
This proves the lemma.

Recall that G does not belong to Si≥1,i≥j≥0 Fi,j ∪ Si≥1,j,k≥0 F g

Lemma 7.1, rg(G) = ǫg(G) = 0.

i,j,k by Lemma 4.5. By

An edge-cut of G is an ordered partition [A, B] of V (G). The order of [A, B] is the
number of edges with one end in A and one end in B. [A, B] is a splitter if it has order at
most two with |A| ≥ 2 such that G[A] has girth at least g and G[B] is 2-connected.

Since G is 2-connected, the order of any splitter [A, B] is two. Since A, B contain
at least two vertices, the edges between A and B do not share ends. In the rest of this
section, if [A, B] is a splitter, then we let uA, vA be the ends of the edges between A, B in
A, and let uB and vB be the ends of the edges between A, B in B; let nA = |A|, nB = |B|,
mA = |E(G[A])| and mB = |E(G[B])|; let SA, SB be minimum feedback vertex sets of
G[A], G[B], respectively. Observe that SA and SB have size at most tgmA + δg(G[A]) and

17

tgmB + δg(G[B]), respectively, since G is g-minimal. Note that G[A], G[B] are connected
and each contains at least two vertices of degree at most two, since G is 2-connected.

Lemma 7.2. If [A, B] is a splitter, then no feedback vertex set of G[B] with size at most
tgmB + rg(G[B]) contains at least one of uB or vB. In particular, G[B] /∈ Si≥1,j≥0 Fi,j ∪
S4≥i≥1,j≥0,k≥1 F g
i,j,k, and G[B] cannot be obtained from a member of S4≥i≥1,j≥0,k≥1 F g
by subdividing an edge.

i,j,k

Proof. Suppose that SB contains at least one of uB or vB. Hence, SA ∪ SB is a feedback
vertex set with size at most tg(mA + mB) + rg(G[A]) + rg(G[B]) = tgm + rg(G[A]) +
rg(G[B]) − 2tg. Since rg(G) = 0, rg(G[A]) + rg(G[B]) − 2tg > 0.

Suppose that g = 4. Since G[A] has girth at least four, by Lemma 5.1, r4(G[A]) ≤ 2
9 ,
and the equality holds only when G[A] is obtained from a disjoint union of L by adding
edges between diﬀerent copies of L such that each added edge is a cut-edge. By Lemma
5.1, since G[B] is 2-connected and does not contain K +
3 , and
the equality holds only when G[B] = K3. Since r4(G[A]) + r4(G[B]) − 2tg > 0, we have
r4(G[A]) = 2
3 . Therefore, G is obtained from a disjoint union of a K3
and at least one copy of L by adding edges such that each added edge is between diﬀerent
graphs. In other words, G ∈ F 4
3,0,k for some positive integer k, a contradiction. Hence
g = 5.

4 as a subgraph, r4(G[B]) ≤ 1

9 and r4(G[B]) = 1

Since G[A] has ﬁrth at least ﬁve, r5(G[A]) ≤ 1

5 by Lemma 5.2. Note that G[A] contains
at least two vertices of degree at most two. Together with Lemma 3.2, r5(G[A]) = 1
5 only
when G[A] is obtained from a disjoint union of copies of members of F4,2 with girth at
lest ﬁve by adding edges such that each added edge is a cut-edge. Recall that R is the
only member of F4,2 with girth at least ﬁve by Lemma 3.3. Since G[B] does not contain
K +
5 , and the
equality holds only when G[V (B)] ∈ F3,0 ∪ F3,1. Since r4(G[A]) + r4(G[B]) − 2tg > 0,
we have r4(G[A]) = 1
3,1,k for some positive
integer k, a contradiction. This proves that no feedback vertex set of G[B] with size at
most tgmB − rg(G[B]) contains at least one of uB or vB.

4 as a subgraph but contains at least two vertices of degree two, r5(G[B]) ≤ 2

5 . Therefore, G ∈ F 5

5 and r4(G[B]) = 2

3,0,k ∪ F 5

In particular, by Lemma 4.5, G[B] 6∈ S4

If G[B]
is obtained from a member of S4≥i≥1,j≥0,k≥1 F g
i,j,k by subdividing an edge, then at least
one of uB, vB is not the new vertex obtained from subdividing an edge, so G[B] admits a
feedback vertex set of size at most tg(mB − 1) + rg(G[B]) containing at least one of uB, vB
by Lemma 4.5, a contradiction.

A splitter is tight if there exists no splitter [A′, B′] such that B′ ⊂ B.

Lemma 7.3. If [A, B] is a tight splitter, then either G[A] = K2, or φ(G[A]) ≤ tgmA − 2tg.

Proof. Since G[B] is 2-connected and contains at least two vertices of degree two, rg(G[B]) ≥
0 by Lemma 7.2. So |SB| ≤ tgmB. We assume that G[A] 6= K2, and we shall prove that
|SA| ≤ tgmA − 2tg.

18

If g = 4, then rg(G[A′]) ≥ 2

9 . Since G[A′] has girth at least four and contains at least
two vertices of degree two, by Lemma 5.1, r4(G[A′]) = 2
9 and G[A′] is obtained from a
disjoint union of copies of graphs in F3,1 by adding edges such that each new edge is a
cut-edge. By Lemma 4.5, SA′ can be chosen such that u′
A ∈ SA′. Then SA′ is a feedback
vertex of G[A] with size at most 2

9 = tgmA − 2tg, as claimed

9 (mA − 3) + 2

9 mA − 4

9 = 2

We ﬁrst assume that uA is adjacent to vA. Since G[A] 6= K2, uA and vA can not
both have degree two in G. So both uA and vA have degree three in G, otherwise one of
uA, vA is a cut-vertex in G. Let u′
A be the neighbor of uA in G[A] other than vA. Let
A′ = A − {uA, vA}. Since G is g-minimal, G[A′] admits a feedback vertex set SA′ with size
at most tg(mA − 3) + rg(G[A′]). Since SA′ ∪ {uA} ∪ SB is a feedback vertex of G of size at
most tgmA − 3tg + rg(G[A′]) + 1 + tgmB = tgm − 5tg + 1 + rg(G[A′]). Since φ(G) > tgm,
we know rg(G[A′]) > 5tg − 1.

If g = 5, then rtg (G[A′]) ≥ 1

5 . Since G[A′] has girth at least ﬁve and contains at least
two vertices of degree two, by Lemma 5.2, r5(G[A′]) = 1
5 and G[A′] is obtained from a
disjoint union of copies of graphs in F4,2 by adding edges such that each new edge is a
cut-edge in G[A′]. By Lemma 4.5, SA′ can be chosen such that u′
A ∈ SA′. Then SA′ is a
feedback vertex of G[A] with size at most 1
5 = tgmA − 2tg, as
claimed.

5 (mA − 3) + 1

5 mA − 2

5 = 1

Hence we may assume that uA is not adjacent to vA. Let G′′ = G[A] + uAvA.

If
G[A] is 2-connected, then G′′ is 2-connected.
If G[A] is not 2-connected, then it has
precisely two end-blocks, each containing uA and vA, respectively, since G is 2-connected.
So G′′ is 2-connected in either case. G′′ admits a feedback vertex set S′′ with size at
most tg(mA + 1) + rg(G′′). Then S′′ ∪ SB is a feedback vertex set in G with size at most
tg(m − 1) + rg(G′′) vertices. So rg(G′′) > tg.

If g = 4, then r4(G′′) ≥ 1

3 . Since G′′ is 2-connected and G′′ − uAvA has girth at least
four, G′′ ∈ {K3, K +
4 } ∪ F2,2 ⊆ F3,0 ∪ F3,1 ∪ F2,2 by Lemma 5.1. Since G[A] = G′′ − uAvA,
by Lemma 4.4, φ(G[A]) ≤ t4mA + r4(G[A]) − 1 ≤ t4mA − 2t4, where the last inequality
follows from Lemma 5.1.

If g = 5, then r5(G′′) ≥ 2

5 . Since G′′ −uAvA has girth at least ﬁve and G′′ is 2-connected,
5 and G′′ ∈ S3
by Lemma 5.2, r5(G′′) = 2
j=0 F3,j. Since G[A] = G′′ − uAvA, by Lemma 4.4,
φ(G[A]) ≤ t5mA +r5(G[A])−1 ≤ t5mA −2t5, where the last inequality follows from Lemma
5.2.

Therefore, |SA| = φ(G[A]) ≤ tgmA − 2tg vertices.

Lemma 7.4. If [A, B] is a tight splitter, then G[A] = K2.

Proof. Suppose that G[A] 6= K2. By Lemma 7.2, |SB| ≤ tgmB. By Lemma 7.3, |SA| ≤
tgmA − 2tg.

Let H = G[B] − uB. Since G is g-minimal, H admits a feedback vertex set SH of
size at most tg(mB − 2) + rg(H). Then SA ∪ SH ∪ {uB} is a feedback vertex set of G of
size at most tgmA − 2tg + tg(mB − 2) + rg(H) + 1 = tgm − 6tg + 1 + rg(H). Therefore
rg(H) > 6tg − 1 > 0.

19

Suppose g = 4. Then rg(H) > 1

3 . By Lemma 5.1, either H ∈ {K3, K4, K +

4 as a subgraph. Note that H 6= K3 as r4(K3) = 1

4 } ∪ F2,2, or
H contains K +
3 , so either H contains at
most one vertex of degree at most two, or K +
4 . But
G[A] is 2-connected, every end-block of H contains at least one vertex of degree at most
two, and if H is 2-connected, then H contains at least two vertices of degree at most two,
a contradiction.

4 is an end-block of H and H 6= K +

Hence g = 5 and rg(H) > 1

5 . Note that every end-block of H contains at least one
vertex of degree at most two in H, since G[A] is 2-connected. By Lemma 5.2, there exists
a nonnegative integer k such that H is obtained from a disjoint union of a member in
F3,0 ∪ F3,1 and k copies of members of S2
j=0 F4,j by adding edges between diﬀerent graphs
such that each new edge is a cut-edge. But every member of F3,0 ∪ F3,1 contains a cycle
of length less than ﬁve by Lemma 3.2, so the copies of the chosen members of S2
j=0 F4,j

must have girth at least ﬁve. Since [A, B] is tight, k = 0.

Since k = 0, H ∈ F3,0 ∪ F3,1. But if H ∈ F3,1, then uB is the only vertex of G[B] of
degree at most two in G[B], contradicting that G is 2-connected. Therefore, H = K3 and
hence G[B] is the graph obtained from K4 by deleting an edge.

Suppose that uA is adjacent to vA. Then |A−{uA, vA}| ≥ 2, otherwise G[A] is a triangle,
a contradiction. So [A − {uA, vA}, B ∪ {uA, vA}] is a splitter. But G[B ∪ {uA, vA}] ∈ F3,1,
contradicting Lemma 7.2. Hence uA is not adjacent to vA.

Let G′ = G[A] + uAvA. Since G[A] has girth at least ﬁve, G′ does not contain two
disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve. So G′ admits a feedback vertex set S′ of size at
most 1
5 (mA + 1) + r5(G′). Since S′ ∪ SB is a feedback vertex set of G of size at most
5 (mA + 1) + r5(G′) + 1
1
5 . Since G is 2-connected, G′ is
2-connected. Since G′ does not contain two disjoint cycle of length less than ﬁve, G′ ∈ F3,j
for some integer j with 0 ≤ j ≤ 3. Let G′′ be the graph obtained from G′ by subdividing
uAvA, and let w be the new vertex. Then G = G′′ ◦ (wvA, wvA, w). Hence G ∈ F4,j+1, a
contradiction. This proves the lemma.

5 . So r5(G′) ≥ 2

5 m + r5(G′) − 1

5 mB = 1

Lemma 7.5. If u is a vertex of degree two in G, then G contains a cycle C with length g
and a cycle C ′ with length less than g such that u ∈ V (C) and V (C) ∩ V (C ′) = ∅.

Proof. Let G′ be the graph obtained from G by contracting an edge incident to u. Note
that G′ is simple otherwise there exists an edge-cut [A, B] of order two such that G[B] is
a triangle containing u, contradicting Lemma 7.2. Suppose that G′ does not contain two
disjoint cycles of length less than g. Since G is g-minimal, G′ admits a feedback vertex set
S of size at most tg(m − 1) + rg(G′). Note that S is a feedback vertex set of G. Therefore
rg(G′)−tg > 0. Since G′ is 2-connected, by Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, G′ ∈ Fi,j for some integers
i, j with 0 ≤ i ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ j ≤ i. Then G ∈ Fi+1,j, a contradiction. Hence G′ contains
two disjoint cycles of length less than g. Note that one of such cycle must containing u, so
G contains two disjoint cycles, where one has length g and the other has length less than
g.

20

We say a graph H is internally 3-edge-connected if H is 2-edge-connected and for every

edge-cut [A, B] of H of order two, |A| = 1 or |B| = 1.

Lemma 7.6. G is internally 3-edge-connected.

Proof. Suppose that G is not internally 3-edge-connected. So there exists an edge-cut
[A, B] of G of order two such that |A|, |B| ≥ 2. Since G does not contain two disjoint
cycles of length less than g, we may assume that G[A] has girth at least g by symmetry.
Subject to that, we further assume that B is minimal. Let uA, vA be the ends of the edges
between A, B in A, and let uB and vB be the ends of the edges between A, B in B. Let
nA = |A|, nB = |B|, mA = |E(G[A])| and mB = |E(G[B])|.

We claim that G[B] is 2-connected. Suppose that G[B] contains a leaf v. Then v ∈
{uB, vB}. Since G[A] has girth at least g, |B| ≥ 3 by Lemma 7.5. Then [A ∪ {v}, B − {v}]
is an edge-cut of order two with both sides at least two vertices such that G[A ∪ {v}] has
girth at least g, contradicting the minimality of B. So G[B] has minimum degree two.
Suppose that G[B] is not 2-connected. Then there exists a non-trivial end-block B′ of
G[B] such that B′ has girth at least g. Since G is 2-connected, B′ contains uB or vB. Then
[A ∪ V (B′), B] is an edge-cut of G of order two such that G[A ∪ V (B′)] has girth at least
g, contradicting the minimality of B. Therefore G[B] is 2-connected, as claimed.

Hence, [A, B] is a splitter. The minimality of B implies that [A, B] is tight. By Lemma
7.4, G[A] = K2. By Lemma 7.5, there exists a cycle C of length g containing uA and vA
and a cycle C ′ of length less than g such that C and C ′ are disjoint. Note that C is an
induced cycle since otherwise G contains two disjoint cycles of length less than g.

If g = 4, then uB is adjacent to vB. Since G is 2-connected, G[B − {uB, vB}] is
connected and contains at most two end-blocks. By Lemma 7.2, G[B] is not a cycle. So
G[B] − {uB, vB} contains at least two vertices and is not a path. Then G[B] − {uB, vB} has
a non-trivial block B′′ such that G[B] − V (B′′) does not contain a cycle of length less than
g. So [V (G) − V (B′′), V (B′′)] is a splitter, contradicting the tightness of [A, B]. Therefore,
g = 5.

Let G′ = G − {uA, vA, vB}. Note that vB has degree three in G since G[B] is 2-
connected. By the minimality of G, G′ admits a feedback vertex set S′ of size at most
5 (m − 5) + r5(G′) + 1 = 1
1
5 (m − 5) + r5(G′). So r5(G′) > 0. Clearly, G′ 6= K4 and does not
contain K +
4 as a subgraph.

Let y be the vertex in V (C) − {uA, vA, uB, vB}. If uB and y belong to diﬀerent blocks
of G′, then y is a cut-vertex of G′, and hence is a cut-vertex of G[B], since vB is adjacent to
y, a contradiction. So uB and y belong to the same block of G′. Since G[B] is 2-connected,
the block of G′ containing uB, y, denoted by X, is an end-block. Hence G′ has at most
two end-blocks, where at least one of them contains at least two vertices of degree at most
two in G′. By Lemma 5.2, either G′ contains a block that is isomorphic to a member of
S1
j=0 F3,j, or G′ is obtained from a disjoint union of copies of members of S2
j=0 F4,j by

adding edges such that the added edges are cut-edges.

21

Suppose that G′ contains a block, denoted by W , isomorphic to a member of F3,0 ∪F3,1.
If G′ is 2-connected, then G′ contains at least three vertices of degree at most two, so
G′ = W = K3, but then G has no cycle of length less than ﬁve disjoint from C, a
contradiction. So G′ is not 2-connected. Since each member of F3,0 ∪ F3,1 contains a cycle
of length less than ﬁve by Lemma 3.2, W is the block of G′ containing a cycle of length less
than ﬁve. Since [A, B] is tight, W contains three vertices incident with cut-edges of G′,
so G′ contains three end-blocks, a contradiction. Therefore, G′ is obtained from a disjoint
union of copies of members of S2
j=0 F4,j by adding edges such that the added edges are

cut-edges.

Since X contains at least two vertices of degree at most two in G′, and G′ contains
at least two blocks, X contains at least three vertices of degree two in X. Hence X ∈
F4,0 ∪ F4,1, so X contains a cycle of length less than ﬁve by Lemma 3.2. Hence blocks of G′
other than X have girth at least ﬁve and belong to F4,2. By Lemma 3.3, each block of G′
other than X is isomorphic to R. If G′ contains a non-trivial block other than X, then G[B]
is obtained from a graph in F 5
4,j,k for some j ∈ {0, 1} and positive integer k by subdividing
an edge, contradicting Lemma 7.2. Hence G′ = X. Since there exists a cycle of length less
than ﬁve disjoint from C, G′ has at least ﬁve vertices, so G′ ∈ F4,1. Let z be the vertex
in G′ other than y adjacent to vB in G. So uB, y, z are the vertices of degree two in G′.
By Lemma 3.1, the graph, denoted by G′′, obtained from G′ by suppressing y, z belongs
to F2,1. Then G can be obtained from G′′ by taking the operation ◦ and then subdividing
an edge twice. Therefore, G ∈ F4,2, a contradiction. This proves the lemma.

Lemma 7.7. If u, v are vertices of G of degree three, then there exist three internally
disjoint paths from u to v.

Proof. Suppose u and v are vertices of G of degree three for which there are no three
internally disjoint paths from u to v. By Menger’s theorem, there exist two vertices x
and y such that u and v are in diﬀerent components, A and B, of G − {x, y}. Since G is
subcubic, we can assume without loss of generality that x is adjacent to only one vertex
x′ ∈ V (A). If y is adjacent to only one vertex in A, call it y′. Otherwise let y′ be the vertex
in B adjacent to y.

Then G − {xx′, yy′} contains at least two components, one containing A and another
containing B. Since u and v have degree three, these components each have at least two
vertices, contradicting that G is internally 3-edge-connected.

Lemma 7.8. If X ⊆ V (G) and |E(X, V (G − X))| = 3, then G − X is connected and has
at most one nontrivial block. Furthermore, if u, v ∈ V (G − X) are adjacent to vertices in
X but uv 6∈ E(G), then G − X + uv has exactly one nontrivial block, and this block contains
u, v.

Proof. Note that G − X is connected, since otherwise G has a cut-edge. Suppose B1 and
B2 are distinct nontrivial blocks in G − X. Since G − X is connected, there are vertices

22

a ∈ V (B1) and b ∈ V (B2) of degree three in G. By Lemma 7.7, there are three internally
disjoint paths from a to b in G. Since |E(X, G − X)| = 3, at most one of these paths can
contain vertices of X. Then the other two form a cycle in G − X, so a and b are in the
same block, a contradiction.

Suppose u, v ∈ V (G − X) are adjacent to vertices in X but uv 6∈ E(G). Since G − X
is connected, u and v are in the same nontrivial block, B, in (G − X) + uv. Suppose B′
is another nontrivial block in (G − X) + uv. Since (G − X) + uv is connected, there are
vertices a ∈ V (B) and b ∈ V (B′) of degree three in G. Then by Lemma 7.7, there are
three internally disjoint paths from a to b in G. Since |E(X, V (G − X))| = 3, at most one
of these paths can contain vertices of X. Then the other two form a cycle in G − X, so a
and b are in the same block, a contradiction.

Lemma 7.9. G has no triangle.

Proof. Suppose a, b, and c are the vertices of a triangle in G. Since G is not the triangle
and is not the graph obtained from K4 by deleting an edge, a, b, c have degree three by
Lemma 7.6. Let X = {a, b, c}. Let a′, b′, and c′ be the neighbors of a, b, and c not in X
respectively. If a′, b′, and c′ are not pairwise distinct, then G ∈ {K4, K +
4 } by Lemma 7.6.
Therefore a′, b′, and c′ are pairwise distinct. If a′, b′, and c′ are pairwise adjacent, then G
contains two disjoint triangles, a contradiction. Suppose one of a′, b′, c′ is adjacent to the
other two. We may assume without loss of generality that a′ is adjacent to b′ and c′. By
Lemma 7.6, G − X − {a′, b′, c′} is either the empty graph or an isolated vertex. In the ﬁrst
case, G ∈ F3,1, a contradiction. In the second case, φ(G) = 2 ≤ tgm, a contradiction.

Therefore, |E(G[{a′, b′, c′}])| ≤ 1. By symmetry, we may assume that b′ is not adjacent
to a′ or c′. By Lemma 7.8, (G − X) + b′c′ is connected and has at most one nontrivial
block, B. Since G − X has girth at least g, B admits a feedback vertex set S of size at
most tg(m − 5) + ǫg(B) = tgm − 5tg + ǫg(B). Then S ∪ {a} is a feedback vertex set of G
of size at most tgm + ǫg(B) + 1 − 5tg, so ǫg(B) > 5tg − 1. Therefore ǫg(B) > 0.

Since (G − X) + b′c′ has only one nontrivial block, by Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, either
(G − X) + b′c′ ∈ Fi,j for some integers i, j with 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ j ≤ i, or (G − X) + b′c′
contains K +
4 as a subgraph. For the former, G = ((G−X)+b′c′)◦(b′c′, b′c′, a), so G ∈ Fi,j+1,
a contradiction. For the latter, since G is 2-connected, (G − X) + b′c′ can be obtained from
K +

4 by attaching a leaf, so G ∈ F2,2, a contradiction.

Lemma 7.10. No vertex in a cycle of G of length less than ﬁve has degree two in G.

Proof. Let D be a cycle of length less than ﬁve containing a vertex v of degree two in G. D
has length four by Lemma 7.9. By Lemma 7.5, there exists a cycle C of length g containing
v and a cycle C ′ with length less than g disjoint from C. Since v has degree two, D shares
at least three vertices with C. Since G is subcubic, C ′ and D are disjoint cycles of length
less than g, a contradiction.

23

Lemma 7.11. Let a, b, and c be distinct vertices of degree three in G such that abc is a
path in G. Let a1 and a2 be the neighbors of a other than b, let c1 and c2 be the neighbors
of c other than b, and let b′ be the other neighbor of b. If G′ = (G − {a, b, c}) + a1a2 + c1c2,
then G′ contains two disjoint cycles of length less than g.

Proof. Note that a1a2, c1c2 6∈ E(G) since G has no triangle. By Lemma 7.6, G′ is connected.
Note that G = G′ ◦ (a1a2, c1c2, b), so G′ 6∈ Si≥1,j≥0 Fi,j. If G′ has at least two nontrivial
blocks, then G − b has at least two nontrivial blocks. But |E({b}, V (G − b))| = 3, so G − b
has at most one nontrivial block by Lemma 7.8. Therefore, G′ has exactly one nontrivial
block B.

Suppose that G′ does not contain two disjoint cycles of length less than g. Since G is
g-minimal, G′ admits a feedback vertex set S of size at most tg(m − 5) + rg(G′) = tgm +
rg(G′) − 5tg. But S ∪ {b} is a feedback vertex set of G of size at most tgm + rg(G′) − 5tg + 1.
Therefore rg(G′) > 5tg − 1 ≥ 0.

Since G′

6∈ Si≥1,j≥1 Fi,j, and B is the unique nontrivial block of G′, and G′ has no
triangle, by Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, G′ can be obtained from a graph in {K +
j=1 F3,j ∪
S3
j=0 F4,j ⊆ S4
i=2 Si−1
j=0 Fi,j by attaching trees. But every vertex of G′ other than b′ has
degree at least two in G′, so we can attach at most one tree, and this tree is a path P .
Hence there exist integers i, j with 2 ≤ i ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ j ≤ i − 1 such that G ∈ Fi+|E(P )|,j+1,
a contradiction.

Lemma 7.12. If D is a subgraph of G isomorphic to K2,3, then there are three distinct
vertices in G − V (D) adjacent in G to vertices in D.

Proof. Let D be a subgraph of G isomorphic to K2,3. Since G has no triangle, D is an
induced subgraph of G. By Lemma 7.10, every vertex in D has degree three. Let a, b, c be
the vertices of degree two in D. Let a′, b′, c′ be the neighbors of a, b, c not contained in D,
respectively. Since K3,3 ∈ F 4

3,1,0, G 6= K3,3, so not all of a′, b′, c′ are the same.

3,1,0 ∩ F 5

Suppose that a′, b′, and c′ are not pairwise distinct. We may assume without loss of
generality that a′ = b′. Since [V (D) ∪ {a′}, V (G) − V (D) − {a′}] is an edge-cut of order
two, by Lemma 7.6, G − V (D) − {a′} is an isolated vertex, so c′ is adjacent to a′. Then
|E(G)| = 10, and {a, c} is a feedback vertex set of G, a contradiction. Hence a′, b′, c′ are
three distinct vertices in G − V (D) adjacent in G to vertices in D.

Lemma 7.13. G has girth at least ﬁve.

Proof. Suppose that C is a cycle of length less than ﬁve. By Lemma 7.9, C has length
four. Say C = abcda. By Lemma 7.10, a, b, c, and d have neighbors a′, b′, c′, and d′ not in
C, respectively. By Lemma 7.12, a′ 6= c′ or b′ 6= d′. By symmetry, we may assume without
loss of generality that a′ 6= c′.

Let G′ = (G − {a, b, c}) + {a′d, c′d}. By Lemma 7.11, G′ contains at two disjoint cycles
D1, D2 of length less than g. Since G does not contain two such cycles, one of them, say

D1, contains an edge in {a′d, c′d}. In particular, d ∈ V (D1), so D2 contains none of a′d, c′d.
Since D2 is in G′ and is disjoint from D1, V (D2) ∩ V (C) = ∅. Therefore C and D2 are
disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve in G. Hence g = 4. Then D2 is a triangle in G,
contradicting Lemma 7.9. This proves the lemma.

Lemma 7.14. G is cubic and 3-connected, and g = 5.

Proof. Lemmas 7.5 and 7.13 imply that G is cubic. By Lemma 7.7, G is 3-connected.

Suppose that g = 4. Let abc be a path in G on three vertices. Let a1, a2 be the
neighbors of a other than b, and let c1, c2 be the neighbors of c other than b. Since G has
girth at least ﬁve, {a1, a2} ∩ {c1, c2} = ∅. Let G′ = (G − {a, b, c}) + a1a2 + c1c2. By Lemma
7.11, G′ contains two disjoint triangles. Since {a1, a2} ∩ {c1, c2} = ∅, each triangle contains
one of a1a2 and c1c2. Hence G contains a cycle of length four, a contradiction. Therefore,
g = 5.

Lemma 7.15. Let v ∈ V (G), and let a, b, and c be the neighbors of v. Let a1 and a2
be the neighbors of a other than v, and let b1 and b2 be the neighbors of b other than v.
Then G − v contains two disjoint 5-cycles, where one contains the path a1aa2 and the other
contains the path b1bb2.

Proof. Let G′ = (G−{a, v, b})+a1a2+b1b2. By Lemma 7.11, G′ contains two disjoint cycles
D1, D2 of length less than ﬁve. Since G has girth at least ﬁve, each D1, D2 contains exactly
one of a1a2 and b1b2. Say D1 contains a1a2 and D2 contains b1b2. So G[V (D1) ∪ {a}] and
G[V (D2) ∪ {b}] are two disjoint cycles in G − v of length less than six. These two cycles
have length ﬁve since G has girth ﬁve.

By Theorem 6.1, G is the dodecahedron. However, the dodecahedron has 30 edges and
a feedback vertex set of size 6, a contradiction. This completes the proof of Theorem 4.3.
