Abstract

We investigate a biaxial Bianchi IX model with positive cosmological constant, which
is sometimes called the Λ-Taub-NUT spacetime, whose exact solution is well known. The
minisuperspace of biaxial Bianchi IX models admits two non-trivial Killing tensors that play
an important role for deriving the Taub-NUT metric. We also give a brief discussion about
the asymptotic behaviour of Bianchi IX models.

Introduction

The metric of a Bianchi IX spacetime is given as
ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t)ω2

1 + b2(t)ω2

2 + c2(t)ω2
3,

(1.1)

where (t, a, b, c) have dimensions of time or length, since we are setting the speed of light c (not
the c(t) above) equal to unity, as well as Newton’s gravitational constant G. {ωk} is a set of
S3-invariant one-forms,

ω1 = cos ψ dθ + sin ψ sin θ dφ,
ω2 = sin ψ dθ − cos ψ sin θ dφ,
ω3 = dψ + cos θ dφ,

dω1 = ω2 ∧ ω3

(1.3)
where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, 0 ≤ φ < 2π, 0 ≤ ψ < 4π. The three principal circumferences of the distorted S3
are then (4πa, 4πb, 4πc). On the other hand, the Λ-Taub-NUT spacetimes are originally introduced
by [1] as spacetimes whose spatial topology is a biaxial S3 and which satisfy the Einstein equations
with positive cosmological constant,

et cyc.,

Rµν = Λgµν.

(1.4)

The form of the solution depends on the choice of time coordinate; for example it is given by [2, 3]
with an arbitrary constant C0 and arbitrary positive constant D0 as

(1.6)

Thus the Λ-Taub-NUT spacetime is none other than a biaxial Bianchi IX spacetime with positive
cosmological constant.
In this paper we present a new derivation of (1.5) by considering the
minisuperspace deﬁned below.

Here an overdot is a derivative with respect to the proper time t in the metric (1.1). R2

are just permutations of R1
1, and oﬀ-diagonal elements of the Ricci tensor are zero. Let us write
the dimensional variables (t, a, b, c) in terms of dimensionless Misner variables (ζ, α, βa, βb, βc, β, γ)
[4] as

where α tells how spatially large the model is, since the S3-volume is 16π2(3/Λ) 3
γ describe how distorted S3 is.

The scalar curvature of the distorted S3 at one time is

(2.5)

It is interesting to note from Heron’s formula that when the numerator is positive, it is the square
of the area of a triangle of edge lengths (2a, 2b, 2c), which are the principal circumferences divided
by 2π. Then (3)R is 8 times the square of the area of a triangle of edge lengths the principal
circumferences (4πa, 4πb, 4πc), divided by the square of the S3-volume that is 16π2abc. When
the numerator is negative, so (3)R < 0, the edge lengths do not obey the triangle inequality.
Furthermore, when the triangle exists and is acute, all three of the S3 Ricci tensor eigenvalues,
1, (3)R2
(3)R1
3, are positive, but when the triangle is obtuse or does not exist, two of the
Ricci tensor eigenvalues are negative.
Multiplying the S3 scalar curvature by a quantity proportional to the two-thirds power of the

2, and (3)R3

S3 volume gives the dimensionless quantity

Now letting an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to the dimensionless time coordinate ζ,
the Einstein equations (1.4) give three dimensionless 2nd-order equations

¨α = 3 − 3 ˙α2 − 2V e−2α,
¨β = −3 ˙α ˙β +
e−2α,
¨γ = −3 ˙α ˙γ +

and one dimensionless 1st-order constraint equation,

˙α2 − ˙β2 − ˙γ2 = 1 − V e−2α.

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

Note that by combining (2.10), its time derivative, and any two of (2.7)-(2.9), one can derive the
remaining 2nd-order equation, so only the 1st-order constraint (2.10) and any two of the three
2nd-order equations are independent.

Note also that if we choose γ = ˙γ = 0 as an initial condition, then ∂V /∂γ = 0 and ¨γ = 0, so γ

remains zero for all time, which is just a biaxial model.

One notices that (2.7)-(2.10) are reproduced by the following action:

(cid:90)

(2.11)

where now the dot denotes the derivative with respect to τ , and N is a Lagrange multiplier. The
relation between ζ and τ is

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(cid:17)

This is a relativistic point-particle action in three dimensions (α, β, γ) with mass m = 1 and the
minisuperspace metric

ds2 =(cid:0)e6α − V e4α(cid:1) (−dα2 + dβ3 + dγ2).

(2.15)

This three-dimensional (or two-dimensional for biaxial case) curved space obtained from the four-
dimensional Bianchi IX space is an example of a metric on minisuperspace whose geodesics give
solutions of Einstein equations [6]. Therefore, time evolution of a Bianchi IX space with Λ is
equivalent to particle motion along a geodesic curve in this minisuperspace. A more rigorous way
to obtain (2.14) is shown for example in [7].

3 Killing Tensors

We now investigate geometrical properties of the minisuperspace associated with the biaxial
Bianchi IX model with γ = 0, so a = b = (3/Λ)1/2eα+β and c = (3/Λ)1/2eα−2β. Let us ﬁrst
deﬁne null coordinates (u, v) as

u = α − β +

v = α + β +

(3.1)

Then the minisuperspace metric, the nonzero terms of the Levi-Civita connection, and the Ricci
scalar are respectively

ds2 = − 4

U (u, v) dudv with U (u, v) = e3u+3v − e3u+v + e6u−2v,

uu = U−1∂uU,
Γu

vv = U−1∂vU,
Γv

R = 81 U−3e9u(3e−v − 5ev).

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

3.1 Killing Vectors

We ﬁrst show the non-existence of a Killing vector. If K is a Killing vector, its components satisfy
the Killing equations

∇uKu = ∂uKu − Γu
∇vKv = ∂vKv − Γv

uuKu = U ∂u(U−1Ku) = 0,
vvKv = U ∂v(U−1Kv) = 0,
∇vKu + ∇uKv = ∂vKu + ∂uKv = 0.

The ﬁrst two give, for arbitrary functions f (v) and g(u),

or equivalently

Ku = f (v)U,

Kv = g(u)U,

K u = −27

g(u),

K v = −27

f (v).

(3.5)

In two dimensions, the fact that a Killing vector obeys ∇µK µ = 0 implies that the dual one-form

L = εµνK µdxν = −f (v)U du + g(u)U dv

(3.10)

is closed, dL = 0, so that locally it is exact, L = dM (u, v). Integrating this along a line of constant
v gives

(cid:90)

M = −f (v)

U du = −f (v)

M = g(u)

(3.12)

whereas integrating this along a line of constant u gives

Only for f (v) = g(u) = 0 do these agree, so there is no nonzero Killing vector.

3.2 Rank-2 Killing Tensors

For a rank-2 Killing tensor, the Killing equations are
∇uKuu = 0,
∇vKvv = 0,
∇uKvv + 2∇vKuv = 0,
∇vKuu + 2∇uKuv = 0.

Similar to the calculations for a Killing vector, the ﬁrst two equations give

Kuu = f (v)U 2,

Kvv = g(u)U 2,

while the last two indicate

Kuv = A(u, v)U,

One notices that the choice f (v) = 0 and g(u) = 2F1e−6u is consistent with both (3.21) and (3.22)
as follows:

a(u) = F0,

b(v) = A = F0 + 3F1e−2v,

(3.23)

where F0 and F1 are constants. Setting F1 = 0 gives a Killing tensor proportional to the metric,
whereas F1 (cid:54)= 0 gives a nontrivial Killing tensor. F0 = 0 and F1 = 1 give the non-trivial rank-2
Killing tensor as

Kuu = 0, Kvv = 2 e−6u U 2, Kuv = 3 e−2v U.

(3.24)

3.2.1 Killing-Yano Tensors

Since the minisuperspace has two dimensions, the maximum rank of Killing-Yano tensors is also
two, and there exists at most only one rank-2 Killing-Yano tensor. The Killing-Yano equations
∇(µfν)ρ = 0 for fuv = −fvu give

∇ufuv = ∇vfvu = 0.

These equations give

∂ufuv − Γu
∂vfvu − Γv

uufuv = 0 ⇒ fuv = f (v)U,
vvfvu = 0 ⇒ fuv = g(u)U.

(3.25)

(3.26)
(3.27)

(3.28)

Therefore f (v) = g(u) is a constant, and the associated Killing tensor Kµν = fµρf ρ
tional to the metric:

ν is just propor-

K12 = K21 ∝ U.

K11 = K22 = 0,

3.3 Rank-4 Killing Tensors

Similar to the case of rank-2, tedious calculations show that the following rank-4 symmetric tensor
with constants Gk is a Killing tensor

Kuuuu = 0,
Kuuuv = 81 G3 e−2v U 3

(cid:32)

Kuuvv =

Kuvvv =

G0 + 3G1 e−4v + 2G2 e−2v

(cid:0)2e6v − 12 e4v + 18 e2v + 54e6u−4v − 72e3u+v(cid:1)(cid:33)

6

(3.29)
(3.30)

U 2,

(3.31)

(3.32)

(3.33)

Note that if G0 alone is nonzero, the Killing tensor is proportional to the symmetric product of two
metrics; if G1 alone is nonzero, the Killing tensor is proportional to the symmetric product of Kµν
from (3.24) with itself; if G2 alone is nonzero, the Killing tensor is proportional to the symmetric
product of gµν and Kµν; but if G3 (cid:54)= 0, one gets a new nontrivial rank-4 Killing tensor. Here we
shall set G0 = G1 = G2 = 0, G3 = 16.

Note that T0 is just a shift of time, so we choose T0 = 0, and the inequalities above become
equalities at past and future inﬁnity for the proper time t of the biaxial Bianchi IX spacetime
metric.

5 Asymptotic Behaviour of the Bianchi IX model

5.1 Deﬁnition of Asymptotic States

Let us consider the time evolution of a Bianchi IX spacetime without singularity, that is, a solution
that is regular for all −∞ < ζ < ∞. The motion in phase space is, in principle, determined
by six initial conditions, namely α, β, γ and their conjugate momenta πα, πβ, πγ. Since they are
constrained by (2.10), and since it is always possible to shift the time coordinate by a constant, one
can get rid of two constants from the initial conditions. Hence the actual number of parameters is
only four.
Consider those four parameters in the region where α → ∞. We assume that two of them are
β and γ, in other words, we assume that β and γ are asymptotically constants, and ˙β, ˙γ → 0.
Let us denote the other two asymptotic constants by cβ, cγ. As shall be shown shortly, πβ and πγ
diverge as α → ∞. In order to deﬁne cβ and cγ, we ﬁrst investigate the asymptotic behaviour of α
and ˙α, and then we calculate how ˙β and ˙γ damp as α grows. Since ˙β, ˙γ → 0, (2.7) and (2.10) give

¨α = 3 − 3 ˙α2 − 2V e−2α
= 1 − ˙α2 − 2 ˙β2 − 2 ˙γ2
→ 1 − ˙α2,

9

(5.1)

where an overdot denotes the derivative with respect to the dimensionless time coordinate ζ. The
asymptotic solution is

α = ln(D eζ + E e−ζ),

(5.2)

where D and E are constants that each depends on the choice of where ζ = 0, though their product
DE is invariant under constant shifts of ζ and is approximately the asymptotic value of V /4. In
fact, a slightly better asymptotic form, with errors of the order of e−5α, can be shown to be

(5.3)
where G is the asymptotic value of V /2 and where F H is the asymptotic value of (1/16)V 2 −
(1/8)[(∂V /∂β)2 + (∂V /∂γ)2]. Note that D and E, or F , G, and H, at ζ → ∞ are in general
diﬀerent from D and E, or F , G, and H, at ζ → −∞. One can integrate (2.8) to get

α =

ln (F e2ζ + G + He−2ζ),

By assumption β and γ are asymptotically constants, so that one can approximate (5.4) by the
following form:

When (5.2) is used, this is simpliﬁed to

˙αe−2α.

This shows that for regular time evolution in which β and γ do not diverge as α goes to inﬁnity,
˙β → O(e−2α) for large α, and similarly ˙γ → O(e−2α). From the Lagrangian (2.11), the conjugate
momenta of β, γ are

πβ = − e3α ˙β,

πγ = − e3α ˙γ,

which diverge as α grows. However there is a canonical transformation that gives parameters that
are asymptotically constants. Let (˜α, ˜β, ˜γ, ˜πα, ˜πβ, ˜πγ) be a new canonical coordinates deﬁned as

˜α = e2α − V,
˜β = β
˜γ = γ

where we keep ˙α since the equation of motion (2.7) is easier to evaluate than the analogous one

and similar for ˙˜πγ. Therefore if we choose cβ = ˜πβ and cγ = ˜πγ, all of the parameters (β, γ, cβ, cγ)
are asymptotically constants. We call such a set of four asymptotic constants (β, γ, cβ, cγ) at
t → −∞ an initial asymptotic state, while the set at t → +∞ is a ﬁnal asymptotic state.

5.2 Map from Past to Future Inﬁnity

Since asymptotic states are well-deﬁned, one can consider a map f from an initial asymptotic state
to a ﬁnal state,

f : (β, γ, cβ, cγ)− → (β, γ, cβ, cγ)+.

(5.15)

For the biaxial case, we know the exact solution, so that one can explicitly calculate (β, cβ)± as

v − u

Thus the map f is the identity map in the biaxial case, which was suggested by the existence
of two non-trivial Killing tensors in the minisuperspace. We perturbatively and numerically have
found evidence that the map is no longer the identity in a triaxial model, but the exact form of
the map has not yet been calculated.
