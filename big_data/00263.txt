Abstract—The calibration of modern radio interferometers is
a signiﬁcant challenge, speciﬁcally at low frequencies. In this
perspective, we propose a novel iterative calibration algorithm,
which employs the popular sparse representation framework, in
the regime where the propagation conditions bend dissimilarly
the directions of the sources. More precisely, our algorithm is
designed to estimate the apparent directions of the calibration
sources, their powers, the directional and undirectional complex
gains of the array elements and their noise powers, with a reason-
able computational complexity. Numerical simulations reveal that
the proposed scheme is statistically efﬁcient at low SNR and even
with additional non-calibration sources at unknown directions.

I. INTRODUCTION

The calibration is a salient challenge for the new generation
of radio interferometers [1], such as the LOw Frequency
ARray (LOFAR) [2] or the Square Kilometer Array (SKA)
[3]. These instruments consist
in large sensor arrays for
which calibration is essential
to produce accurate images
(> 108 pixels) with high dynamic range (60 dB). Furthermore,
the huge number of array elements imposes the need to design
computationally efﬁcient algorithms.

For such radio interferometers, additional difﬁculties arise
at low frequencies (< 300 MHz), where the ionosphere causes
phase delays which scale with the wavelength [4,5]. In this
paper, we focus on the regime where all lines of sight toward
a source in the sky cross the same ionospheric layer, where
the thickness of the ionosphere can be direction dependent.
In this regime, the ionospheric phase delays are commonly
modeled as a linear function of the distance between the so-
called piercing points [6,7]. As a consequence, it modiﬁes the
geometric delays and introduces direction dependent angular-
shifts for the source directions. By estimating the calibrator
shifts (i.e., the difference between the true calibrator directions,
known from tables [8], and their apparent directions, estimated
from the observations of the radio interferometers), an inter-
polation method can be efﬁciently applied in order to obtain
a phase screen model, that estimates the ionospheric delays
over the entire Field-of-View [6]. In addition to the phase

screen reconstruction step, the calibration usually involves the
estimation of the complex undirectional gains of the antennas,
their directional gains toward each calibrator and their noise
powers [9].

To solve this calibration problem, the a priori knowledge of
some calibration sources is mandatory, i.e., their true/nominal
directions and powers without the effects of the ionosphere
and antenna imperfections [7]. Based on this knowledge,
state-of-the-art calibration algorithms to estimate the afore-
mentioned parameters are mostly of iterative nature [1,7,9].
As an example,
the (Weighted) Alternating Least Squares
approach has been adapted for LOFAR calibration [9], in
which closed form expressions have been obtained for the
undirectional antenna gains, the source powers and the sensor
noise powers. Nevertheless, regarding to the Direction-of-
Arrival (DoA) estimation, no closed form expression can be
obtained and classical subspace methods, such as MUSIC [10],
have to be applied. A major drawback of these methods is that
subspace techniques are not efﬁcient in low Signal-to-Noise-
Radio (SNR) scenarios and require the exact model order in
terms of number of sources in the scene.

As an alternative approach, recently, sparse reconstruction
methods came into focus of DoA estimation for fully cali-
brated arrays [11] as well as for partially calibrated arrays [12].
They exhibit
the super-resolution property, robustness and
computational efﬁciency, without the aforementioned draw-
backs of subspace-based methods [11]. Sparse representation
methods have been successfully applied in radio astronomy for
imaging [13], but, to the best of our knowledge, such methods
have never been applied for this calibration problem.

In this paper, we focus on the calibration of a sensor array,
involving its individual antennas and propagation disturbances.
In addition, we assume that the sensor array has an arbitrary
geometry, identical elements and is simultaneously excited
by inaccurately known calibration sources and unknown non-
calibration sources. We consider these non-calibration sources
as outliers,
i.e., as an additional noise term in the cali-
bration step. From the calibration perspective, we propose
a novel iterative scheme, which successively estimates the
undirectional antenna gains along with the calibrator and noise
parameters, to minimize a proper weighting cost function.
The calibrator parameter estimation relies on the popular

sparse representation framework and the sensor noise power
estimation considers the presence of non-calibration sources
(a.k.a. outliers in our calibration procedure), leading to a robust
and computationally efﬁcient algorithm in low SNR scenarios.
In the following, ¯(.), (.)T , (.)H, (.)† and (.)(cid:12)α de-
note, respectively, conjugation, transpose, Hermitian transpose,
pseudo-inverse and element-wise raising to α. The expectation
operator is E{.}, ◦ denotes the Khatri-Rao product, exp(.)
and (cid:12) represent the element-wise exponential function and
multiplication (Hadamard product), respectively. The operator
diag(.) converts a vector to a diagonal matrix with the vector
aligned on the main diagonal, whereas vecdiag(.) produces a
vector from the main diagonal of its entry and vec(.) converts
a matrix to a vector by stacking the columns of its entry. The
functions (cid:107).(cid:107)0, (cid:107).(cid:107)2 and (cid:107).(cid:107)F refer to l0 norm, i.e., the number
of non-zero elements of its entry, the l2 and Frobenius norms,
respectively. Finally, x (cid:23) 0 means that each element in its
vector x is non-negative.

II. DATA MODEL AND PROBLEM STATEMENT

Let us consider an array of P elements, with known
locations, each detonated by the Cartesian coordinates
ξp = [xp, yp, zp]T for p = 1, . . . , P ,
that we stack in
Ξ = [ξ1, . . . , ξP ]T ∈ RP×3. This array is exposed to
QK known strong calibration sources and additional QU
unknown weak non-calibration sources, with known true

D = (cid:2)d1, . . . , dQK(cid:3) ∈ R3×QK and unknown true DU =
(cid:104)
(cid:105) ∈ R3×QU spatial coordinates, respectively, in

dU
which each direction d = [l, m, n]T can be uniquely described
1 − l2 − m2 [7]. The iono-
by a couple (l, m), since n =
sphere introduces an unknown angular-shift for each source
direction [1,6], and consequently, we distinguish between the
unknown apparent directions for the calibrators, denoted by
DK =
, and their true directions D, i.e., without
the propagation disturbances.

the vector n(n) ∼ CN (0, Σn) denotes the i.i.d. noise, in the
n-th observation [7]. Consequently, the covariance matrix R =

sequel the diagonal matrix that contain the apparent calibrator
sΓKH = diag (σ) ∈ R+QK×QK. Since

and ΓK can be deduced from it. We further introduce the

Note that the estimation of the unknown matrix RU represents
the imaging step [9] which is beyond the scope of the paper.
The imaging step is done usually as a separate step after
the calibration [13]. The main reason is that the calibration
step is usually based on a source point model (unlike the
imaging step) with a known number of calibrators, whereas,
the effect of the weakest (non-calibration) sources, with an
unknown source number, can be assumed absorbed by the
noise component.

In order to overcome the scaling ambiguities in model (5),
we consider the following commonly used assumptions in
radio astronomy [7,9]: i) to solve the phase ambiguity of G,
we take its ﬁrst element as the phase reference; ii) G and

which contains the calibrator steering vectors. We deﬁne AU,
w.r.t. DU, correspondingly for the non-calibration sources.

As in [9], we assume that all antennas have identical
directional responses. Their directional gain responses (and
propagation losses) can be modeled by two diagonal matrices
ΓK ∈ CQK×QK and ΓU ∈ CQU×QU toward the calibration and
non-calibration sources, respectively.

The received signals from each antenna are stacked, for the

calibrator directions, a single rotation of all steering vectors
can be compensated by the undirectional gain phase solution.
We therefore consider an additional know source to remove
both ambiguities, by ﬁxing its direction dK
0 and its power σ0.

A statistically efﬁcient estimator of the model parameters
can be obtained via the Maximum-Likehood formulation,
but it appears intractable in practice. However, with a large
number of samples, statistically efﬁcient estimations can be
reached using the Weighting Least Squares approach. Con-
sequently, we deﬁne the following cost function to mini-
, with R(p) =
mize: κ(p) =
GAKΣAKH GH + Σn denoting the covariance matrix in the
absence of the non-calibration sources, and W is the weighting
matrix. The optimal weighting matrix for Gaussian noise is
W = R [9], which is generally unknown. In radio astronomy,
sources are typically much weaker than the noise [14], so the
covariance matrix can be approximated by R ≈ Σn. Since
the array consists of identical antennas and mutual coupling
is negligible, it is commonly assumed that Σn = diag (σn) ≈
σnI. Consequently, we consider W = I as an initial step and
reﬁne it with W = Σn once we obtain an estimate of Σn.
Since Σn is diagonal, we rewrite the cost function κ(p) as

We aim at minimizing the cost function κn(p) in an iterative

parameters in p ﬁxed as described in the Subsection III-
B. In a sequential step, we minimize (6) w.r.t.
the vari-
ables σ, dK
QK and σn for ﬁxed g, by using a sparse
representation approach as described in the Subsection III-
C. The overall procedure, referred to as the Iterative and
Sparsity Based Calibration Algorithm (ISBCA), is presented in
Algorithm 1. The algorithm is initialized with the true/nominal
calibrator parameters and an initial guess for the undirectional
gains or the unit sensor gain. In the following, we detail the
two major alternating optimization steps of the ISBCA.

B. Undirectional Antenna Gain Estimation (Algorithm 2)

In this subsection, we describe Algorithm 2 of the ISBCA.
We follow the same iterative approach as discussed in [14],
that we adapt for our cost function (6) that we optimize w.r.t.
g for the remaining parameter in p ﬁxed.

Toward this aim, we consider g and ¯g as two independent
variables. We ﬁrst regard ¯g as ﬁxed and minimize (6) w.r.t. g,
only, and without considering the diagonal elements in the cost
function (6) that contain the unknown noise variances σn, i.e.,

where κp
n(gp) corresponds to the cost function for the p-th
row of R, which depends only on gp since the remaining
parameters are considered as ﬁxed in this step. Let us deﬁne
the operator Sp(.), that converts to a vector the p-th row of a
matrix and removes the p-th element of this selected vector.
Further, deﬁne the vector ˆrp = Sp
and the weighting
vector wn = Sp (Wn). We can thus write κp
n(gp) in (7) as
n(gp) = (cid:107)(ˆrp − zgp) (cid:12) wn(cid:107)2

κp
in which z = Sp
represents the calibrator sky model. Since κp
n(gp) is a Least
Squares function of gp, by using standard inversion techniques
and introducing zw = z(cid:12)Sp (Wn), its minimizer is given by
ˆgp = zH
w ˆrp
w z . After this, we directly update gp and proceed
zH
in the same manner with the remaining parameters in g.
This procedure, summarized in Algorithm 2, is repeated until
convergence.

(Algorithm 3)

In this subsection, we describe Algorithm 3 of the ISBCA
for optimizing (6) w.r.t. the calibrator parameters and noise
powers, that is based mainly on the popular sparse represen-
tation framework.

Assuming that the calibration sources are well separated,
which is common in radio astronomy [7,9], we consider in
the sequel that: i) each apparent calibration source lies in an
sector of displacements around its nominal location; ii) the
displacement sectors of different calibration sources are not
overlapping; iii) each following dictionary shall represent the
displacement set corresponding to its source.

To consider the l0 constraints in (16), which are generally
difﬁcult, we choose the Iterative Hard Thresholding scheme
of [16]. This greedy algorithm is based on a projected gradi-
ent descend direction algorithm and offers strong theoretical
guarantees that have already been employed in the DoA
estimation context [17]. Particularly, when the grid is ﬁne and
the columns of ˜Aq are strongly similar, we can guarantee that
each ˜σq obtained from (16) is exactly 1-sparse. Thus, using the
Coordinate Descent algorithm [18] to minimize (16), we obtain
an analytic solution for each sub-problem and the sparsity of
the desired minimizer ˜σ reduces the computational complexity
[18]. Each step involves the hard thresholding operator Hs(.),
that keeps the s-largest components of a vector and sets the
remaining entries equal to zero, thus, it automatically satisﬁes
both constraints of sparsity and positivity. We allow a step
q that depends on ˜σq and the k-th iteration,
size factor µk
hence considering the Normalized Iterative Hard Thresholding
procedure of [15], where the choice of µk
q assures convergence
toward a local minimum.

Since the p-th element σn,p of σn is only present in the p-
th diagonal term of R, ignoring this term does not affect the
estimation of ˜σ. Thus, σn is estimated after the estimation of
˜σ, for which σn (cid:23) 0 holds in low SNR scenarios.

Let us denote ˇˆr and ˇC, that refer, respectively, to ˆr and C
without their elements corresponding to the diagonal of R.
The solution of (16) w.r.t. ˜σ can then be obtained as

ˆ˜σ = arg min
subject to ˜σ (cid:23) 0,(cid:107) ˜σq(cid:107)0 = 1 for q = 1, . . . , QK ,

which is used in Algorithm 3.

Afterward, the minimizer of (16) w.r.t. σn is given by

ˇσn = vecdiag

a(dr)H(cid:16) ˆR − GAKΣAKH GH(cid:17)

The proposed method is tested using Monte-Carlo sim-
ulations and compared with the deterministic Cramér–Rao
bound (CRB), that expresses a lower bound on the variance
of any unbiased estimator. We test the algorithm in standard
situations, with similar sensor locations, sky and parameters
as in [1,7,9].

The antenna locations correspond to the LOFAR’s Initial
Test Station [19], with P = 60 antennas disposed in a ﬁve-
armed spiral. We assume a sky model at 30 MHz (λ = 10 m)
consisting of QK = 2 strong calibration sources and QU = 8
weak non-calibration sources, provided from the ten strongest
sources in the table of [8]. The total power of these sources is
assumed to be 1% of the total antenna noise power, a typical
scenario for radio interferometers [9]. Data are generated via
the signal model given in (3), in order to obtain the sample
covariance matrix. We choose initially a coarse grid, with the
same resolution for each coordinate and each calibrator. To
avoid off-grid mismatch, we apply grid reﬁnements [11] until
we achieve the theoretical limits given by the CRB.

To investigate the algorithm performances, we perform 500
Monte-Carlo runs for each sample size. The variances of
the errors on the complex undirectional gains, the calibrator
directions and the powers, are plotted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2,
as a function of the number of samples N and compared to
the corresponding CRB. As expected, the method appears to
be asymptotically statistically efﬁcient in low SNR scenarios,
even with the presence of non-calibration sources. The (Rela-
tive) Mean Square Error may be slightly lower than the CRB
for some values of N as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. This is
mainly due to the fact that our algorithm takes into account
the true/nominal direction of the calibrators (see (9)), whereas
the classical CRB does not include this prior knowledge.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we presented a novel iterative scheme for
the calibration of radio interferometers, where different shifts
affect the apparent directions and powers of the calibration
sources. The proposed algorithm, named Iterative and Sparsity
Based Calibration Algorithm (ISBCA), iteratively minimizes
a weighting Least Squares function in order to estimate the
complex undirectional antenna gains and their noise powers,
whereas, it jointly estimates the directions and powers of the
calibrators using the Normalized Iterative Hard Thresholding
procedure. This leads to a statistically efﬁcient, computa-
tionally efﬁcient and robust scheme as shown by numerical
simulations.
