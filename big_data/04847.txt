Averages of short correlations: a note

giovanni coppola

1. Introduction and statement of main results.

We have studied the so-called “correlations”(mainly, in particular case g = f of autocorrelations) of two
arithmetic functions f, g : N → C, that are also called (much more, in the modular forms environment)
“shifted convolution sums”, i.e. (in this paper we do not conjugate g(n − a), even if g values are complex)

Cf,g(N, a)

def

= Xn∼N

f (n)g(n − a),

where a is called the shift, the abbreviation n ∼ N in sums stands for N < n ≤ 2N , for integers N > 0
(more generally, n ∼ X is X < n ≤ 2X, for real X > 0). Actually, our “Generations”, to abbreviate [CL1]
title, displays, with diﬀerent approaches for the asymptotic and upper bound estimates, many diﬀerent
types of averages, for such quantities; mainly, it deals with three generations, namely three kinds of averages
starting with the easiest, i.e., what we call the first generation of correlation averages:

Cf (a),

Xa≤H

where we abbreviate a ≤ H for 1 ≤ a ≤ H and Cf (a) for Cf,f (N, a), in above notation (in fact, an
autocorrelation). Hereafter we stick to short interval averages, namely H = o(N ), when N → ∞. In the
following, h ≪ HN −ε will appear, as a kind of length for “super-short intervals”.
(Compare our main
results.) Hereafter the Vinogradov notation ≪ and the synonymous Landau’s O notation will be used; also,
with subscripts to indicate the O−constant dependence. (Typically, ≪ε depends on arbitrarily small ε > 0.)

In our [CL1] study and in the subsequent [CL2] it is clear that the correlations of shift a are immediately

linked (see [E], for a great exposition) to the arithmetic progressions, with residue class a :

Cf,g(N, a) = Xq≤Q

g′(q) Xn∼N

n≡a mod q

f (n),

assuming that the so-called Eratosthenes transform of our g, g′ def
= g ∗ µ (with ∗ the Dirichlet product
and µ M¨obius arithmetic function), has support up to Q (see the following). Since we clearly assumed to
have Q ≪ N , there’s no problem with the number of such n, in the inner sum (in worst case ≫ 1 of them).
In this paper we study the (a priori) much harder problem of estimating sums of the kind (here H ≥ h

and H = o(x), as we may assume N ≪ x ≪ N ):

Xa≤H Xx<n≤x+h

f (n)g(n − a) = Xa≤H Xq≤Q

g′(q) Xx<n≤x+h

n≡a mod q

f (n)

where the “short” length h ≤ H, instead of previous “long” length N , renders this kind of ﬁrst generation
for short correlations much more diﬃcult (at least “for arithmetic progressions”, compare Theorem 0), as

q > h =⇒ Xx<n≤x+h

n≡a mod q

f (n) = n f (na)

0

if na ∈ (x, x + h]
otherwise

(see the proof of Lemma in §2) is involving “sporadic sums”,
i.e. sums with “at most one term and”, in
a probabilistic sense, “vanishing most of the time”. (In the above example, see Lemma proof, this simply
means : the number of as for which the n−sum doesn’t vanish turns out to be “small”, compared to all as.)

However, an elementary argument (our Lemma) shows that we may gather H ≥ h residue classes, so
to avoid sporadically appearing terms ! Here, the fact that we consider a kind of average, instead of single
correlations, is vital ! (Actually, without any kind of average, short correlations may not be treated at all !)

Before going on, we need the following two deﬁnitions (for which, compare [CL1] & [CL2]).

We say, for a general arithmetic function f : N → C,

f is essentially bounded

def
⇐⇒ ∀ε > 0, f (n) ≪ε nε, as n → ∞.

(Notice : compare this with Ramanujan’s Conjecture in Selberg Class and in modular forms environment.)

We say f : N → C is a sieve function of range Q when the Eratosthenes transform of f , say,
f ′ : N → C (so that f = f ′ ∗ 1 by M¨obius inversion : hereafter 1 is the constant-1 arithmetic function), is
supported up to Q and essentially bounded; in other words, the sieve functions of range Q are representable
as

f (n)

f ′(q),

def

= Xq|n,q≤Q

for a certain arithmetic function f ′ (the f Eratosthenes transform), satisfying f ′(q) ≪ε qε. Since, by
M¨obius inversion, “f is essentially bounded” is equivalent to “f ∗ µ is essentially bounded”, we may also
identify sieve functions of range Q with truncated divisor sums up to Q that satisfy Ramanujan Conjecture.

We give, for ﬁrst, our easiest result for averages of short correlations.

Theorem 0. Let h, H, x ∈ N with h ≤ H and H = o(x), as x → ∞. Take any essentially bounded
arithmetic functions f, g : N → C. Then

Xa≤H Xx<n≤x+h

f (n)g(n − a) = 

Xa≤H

g(x − a)



 Xx<n≤x+h

f (n)

 + Oε(cid:0)xεh2(cid:1) .

Proof is exhibited here, as it is 1−line (setting b := a − n + x and back a instead of b, using n − x ≪ h) :

Xa≤H Xx<n≤x+h

f (n)g(n − a) = Xx<n≤x+h

f (n) Xa≤H

g(x − (a − n + x)) = Xx<n≤x+h

f (n) Xa≤H

g(x − a) + Oε(cid:0)xεh2(cid:1) .

(A symbol

will signify, as usual, the end of a Proof, likewise ⋄

the end of a Remark.)
Remark 0. The remainders are non-trivial when h ≪ H/xε, i.e., the H−average is “long enough”.
⋄
Remark 1. See that the following results for short correlations averages are intended both to give some
further insight and to get new results, from comparing with Theorem 0; which is, of course, far simpler ! ⋄

Our second main result for averages of short correlations will be proved in §3.

Theorem 1. Let h, H, Q, x ∈ N with h ≤ H < Q and Q ≪ x, H = o(x) as x → ∞. Take any
essentially bounded f : N → C and a sieve function g : N → C of range Q with Eratosthenes
transform g′. Then

Xa≤H Xx<n≤x+h

Rather an identical argument also gives the following companion result, proved in §3, too.

Theorem 2. Let the same hypotheses of Theorem 1 hold. Then

Xa≤H Xx<n≤x+h

f (n)g(n − a) = 


 Xx<n≤x+h
f (n) −

In passing, from the comparison of Theorem 0 and Theorem 2, the following result immediately follows.
Corollary. Let h, H, x ∈ N with h ≤ H and H = o(x), as x → ∞. Take any essentially bounded
arithmetic functions f, g′ : N → C. Then


H Xq≤h

This entails, choosing ﬁrst a vanishing g′ in the interval

[1, h] and, then, vanishing in (h, H], both

Remark 2. The further hypotheses on g and Q, from Theorem 2 (i.e. from Th.m 1), are not used at all ! ⋄

As we saw before, it is then immediate to glue together these super-short intervals to get, as a corollary

to Theorem 0, a result for the ﬁrst generation of correlations (these are the “long ones”, this time).
Theorem 3. Let H, D, Q, N ∈ N with H < Q and D, Q ≪ N , H = o(N ) as N → ∞. Choose an integer
h such that h → ∞ as N → ∞. Take two sieve functions f, g : N → C of ranges D, Q, resp. Then

Remark 3. The second formula follows by estimating trivially for m ≤ L := log N → ∞ and for L < m ≤ h
applying ﬁrst formula (all “logs” and so on are inside N ε), whose proof we leave to the interested reader. ⋄

We’ll study applications of Theorem 3 in future papers (and versions of present one).

The paper is organized as follows: our Lemma is given and proved in §2, then §3 proves main results, namely
Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. (Notice that we call these “main”, as opposed to side results, i.e., the Lemma
and the Remarks. These, in turn, have their own interest, not only in view of proving Theorems.)

2. Pinch Lemma.

We start with so-called “Pinch Lemma”, since it pinches, so to speak, integers in (very) short intervals,
“squeezing” them to the left interval extreme (see Remark 4, after the proof). In fact, these short intervals
contain at most one integer in the speciﬁed residue class modulo q, since q > h, where h is the interval’s
length. We actually rebuild the whole interval, after summing over H ≥ h residue classes.

Lemma. Let h, H, Q ∈ N with h ≤ H < Q and Q ≪ x, H = o(x), as x → ∞. Take two essentially
bounded arithmetic functions f, g′ : N → C. Then both

Notice we have non-triviality for the remainders when h is signiﬁcantly smaller than H, say log h < log H.

Proof. For the ﬁrst formula write LHS (left hand side) as
