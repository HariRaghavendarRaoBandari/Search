Horndeski’s theory of gravity is the most general scalar-tensor theory with a single scalar whose equations
of motion contain at most second-order derivatives. A subsector of Horndeski’s theory known as “Fab Four”
gravity allows for dynamical self-tuning of the quantum vacuum energy, and therefore it has received particular
attention in cosmology as a possible alternative to the ΛCDM model. Here we study compact stars in Fab Four
gravity, which includes as special cases general relativity (“George”), Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity
(“Ringo”), theories with a nonminimal coupling with the Einstein tensor (“John”) and theories involving the
double-dual of the Riemann tensor (“Paul”). We generalize and extend previous results in theories of the John
class and were not able to ﬁnd realistic compact stars in theories involving the Paul class.

INTRODUCTION

The most recent cosmological observations are consistent
with standard cosmological models built on general relativity
(GR), but they imply the presence of a mysterious late-time
acceleration phase. The late-time acceleration can be inter-
preted as due to the existence of new particle sectors beyond
the Standard Model, or explained by assuming that GR itself
is modiﬁed on cosmological scales. Modiﬁed gravity models
differ widely in their physical motivations, but many of them
can be reformulated in terms of scalar-tensor theories of grav-
itation, i.e., they are mathematically equivalent to a gravita-
tional theory whose degrees of freedom are the metric gµν and
one or more scalar ﬁelds φ. Many of the simplest dark energy
or modiﬁed gravity models – including the standard ΛCDM
model – are plagued by the cosmological constant problem
(i.e., the problem of ﬁne-tuning the potentially huge quantum
vacuum energy against the small value of the observed cos-
mological constant). However some scalar-tensor theories al-
low for a “dynamical self-tuning mechanism” in which the ef-
fects of the cosmological constant may be compensated within
the scalar ﬁeld sector, so that they do not appear in the met-
ric, by relaxing the assumptions of Weinberg’s no-go theorem
[1]. Here we will focus on one such model, called “Fab Four”
gravity in the literature, which is a special case of Horndeski’s
theory.

A. Horndeski’s theory

Realistic models of dark energy or modiﬁed gravity must
at the very least pass the stringent experimental constraints

on deviations from GR [2, 3] and be theoretically viable. In
particular, they must be free of the so-called “Ostrogradski
ghost” [4]. Several studies led to the conclusion that the
most general models with a single additional scalar degree
of freedom compatible with these requirements correspond to
the scalar-tensor theory formulated by Horndeski about forty
years ago, whose equations of motion contain at most second-
order derivatives [5]. It was shown [6] that Horndeski’s the-
ory is equivalent to the generalization of a scalar ﬁeld the-
ory with Galilean shift symmetry in ﬂat spacetime to curved
spacetime [7], whose action reads

Special cases of Horndeski’s theory correspond to well-
studied models of dark energy and modiﬁed gravity, includ-
ing quintessence [8, 9], k-essence [10], the Dvali-Gabadadze-
Porrati (DGP) model [11, 12], and f (R) gravity [13–16].
However it is desirable to restrict the large number of func-
tional degrees of freedom of the action (1) by additional the-
oretical or phenomenological requirements. For example, it

α and (cid:3)φ ≡ gµνφµν.

is desirable to restrict the Horndeski action to models that al-
low for dynamical self-tuning of the quantum vacuum energy.
This requirement leads to the Fab Four theory.

B. Fab Four theory

Starting from the Horndeski action (1), Charmousis et
al. [17, 18] considered homogeneous isotropic cosmological
models satisfying the following requirements:

1. The theory admits the Minkowski vacuum for any value

of the vacuum energy.

2. The Minkowski vacuum persists across any phase trans-
ition where the vacuum energy changes instantaneously
by a ﬁnite amount.

3. The theory admits nontrivial cosmological evolution in

the presence of matter.

These requirements lead to the Fab Four action

matter ﬁelds Ψ do not couple directly to the scalar ﬁeld φ.

“George” reduces to GR and “Ringo” – the Einstein-
dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) term – becomes trivial in four

dimensions when the respective potentials are constant. Com-
pact objects in these theories (George and Ringo) have been
studied in detail in the existing literature. What is more crucial
for self-tuning are the “John” and “Paul” terms, which will be
the main focus of this paper.

C. Cosmology and Black Holes in Fab Four Theory

Cosmological evolution in Fab Four gravity in the presence
of ordinary matter and radiation has been exhaustively invest-
igated by Copeland et al. [19]. They demonstrated that for
a speciﬁc choice of the Fab Four potentials in Eq. (5), even
if the source is dominated by the vacuum energy and there
is no explicit matter ﬂuid, the cosmological evolution toward
the self-tuned Minkowski attractor can mimic the matter-
dominated evolution corresponding to dark matter. Moreover,
Refs. [20, 21] demonstrated the existence of a self-tuned de
Sitter (dS) attractor for a certain nonlinear combination of the
canonical kinetic term to the Fab Four. Refs. [22, 23] presen-
ted a systematic derivation of the most general subclass of
Horndeski’s theory that can allow for a spatially ﬂat self-tuned
dS vacuum. This new subclass of Horndeski’s theory is ex-
pected to have a deep connection to the Fab Four theory, but it
was derived in an independent way and their relation remains
unclear. A speciﬁc form of John and Paul also appears in a
proxy theory to nonlinear massive gravity [24], but a close in-
spection of cosmological dynamics revealed that there is no
de Sitter attractor in this model [25].

A challenge to the Fab Four model is that self-tuning has
been veriﬁed only for homogeneous, isotropic cosmological
backgrounds. The presence of stars and black holes (BHs)
in the Universe implies that self-tuning should still occur in
the presence of local inhomogeneities of the spacetime, such
as point masses or extended self-gravitating bodies. Whether
self-tuning occurs in inhomogeneous spacetimes is a non-
trivial question.

A ﬁrst step towards answering this question is the invest-
igation of BH solutions in Fab Four theory. Most studies of
BH solutions in Horndeski’s theory and Fab Four gravity have
focused on the shift-symmetric subclass of the theories. An
inﬂuential work by Hui and Nicolis [26] proved a BH no-hair
theorem in Horndeski gravity. The theorem makes the fol-
lowing assumptions: (i) the spacetime is static and spherically

symmetric; (ii) the scalar ﬁeld shares the same symmetries as
the spacetime, i.e. φ = φ(r), where r is the radial coordin-
ate; (iii) the theory is shift-symmetric, i.e. it is invariant under
the transformation φ → φ + c, where c is a constant; (iv) the
spacetime is asymptotically ﬂat.

Searches for hairy BH solutions followed two main routes:
they either looked for loopholes in the Hui-Nicolis theorem, or
relaxed the assumptions behind the theorem. All BH solutions
found so far in Horndeski’s theory have secondary hair, i.e.
the scalar charge is not independent of other charges, such as
the mass (see e.g. [27] for a review of BH solutions with scalar
hair).

Sotiriou and Zhou found a loophole in the Hui-Nicolis no-
hair theorem [28, 29]. In our language, they considered the
combination George+Ringo with Vgeorge = constant and
Vringo ∝ φ in Eq. (5b). Other authors relaxed assumption
(iv), ﬁnding asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) BH solutions
for actions of the John type (nonminimal coupling to the Ein-
stein tensor) with Vjohn = const [30–32]. (see [33, 34] for
the stability analysis of BH solutions in John class of the-
ory). BH solutions that may be more relevant for astrophys-
ics were found by Babichev and Charmousis [35] for theor-
ies of the George+John type, with Vgeorge and Vjohn both
constant, relaxing assumption (ii). Babichev and Charm-
ousis introduced a linear time dependence in the scalar ﬁeld,
that therefore does not possess the same symmetries as the
metric. However the effective energy-momentum tensor re-
mains static because of the shift symmetry. A particularly
important asymptotically ﬂat BH solution emerging from this
analysis is a “stealth” solution in the George+John class: a
Schwarzschild BH metric supports a nontrivial, regular scalar
ﬁeld conﬁguration which does not backreact on the space-
time. By adding the canonical kinetic term for the scalar ﬁeld
and the cosmological constant Λ, Babichev and Charmousis
also obtained a Schwarzschild-(A)dS solution. Interestingly,
the effective cosmological constant one can read off from the
Schwarzschild-(A)dS metric does not depend on Λ, and the
Λ dependence appears only in the scalar ﬁeld. Therefore this
solution may be interpreted as an extension of the self-tuned
dS vacuum to an inhomogeneous spacetime.

In Ref. [36], all of the above static, spherically symmet-
ric BH solutions were generalized to slow rotation at leading
order in the Hartle-Thorne approximation [37, 38]. For all
of these solutions, ﬁrst-order corrections due to rotation were
shown to be identical to GR. The Hui-Nicolis no-hair the-
orem was extended to slowly rotating BHs for which the scalar
ﬁeld is allowed to have a linear time dependence. Moreover,
all the spherically symmetric solutions obtained for the John
class can be naturally extended to the shift- and reﬂection-
symmetric subclass of Horndeski’s theory, namely theories
with G2 = G2(X), G4 = G4(X) and G3 = G5 = 0 [39].

In summary: nontrivial BH solutions in Fab Four gravity
were found for the Ringo and John subclasses. In particular,
the Schwarzschild-dS solution found in the case of nonmin-
imal coupling with the Einstein tensor (John) can be seen as a
self-tuned BH solution. On the other hand, to our knowledge,
no analytic or numerical BH solutions have been reported for
the Paul subclass. Because of the similarity between John and

3

Paul, one may naively expect that Paul should also allow for
self-tuned, inhomogeneous vacuum solutions. This question
was partially addressed by Appleby [40], who claimed that
self-tuned BH solutions would not exist in the Paul case. This
is because in a Schwarzschild-dS spacetime the Weyl com-
ponents of P µν
αβ and RGB terms in the scalar ﬁeld equation
of motion contain an explicit dependence on the radial co-
ordinate, and leave no redundancy in the scalar ﬁeld equation
of motion. This is in contrast to the case of “John,” where the
scalar ﬁeld equation of motion contains no Weyl component
which could make it redundant for a Schwarzschild-dS met-
ric. This also hints at the absence of similar BH solutions in
the non-reﬂection-symmetric subclass of the shift-symmetric
Horndeski theory with nonzero G3(X) and G5(X), although
there are no detailed studies of this issue.

D. Plan of the paper

The next natural step to test whether the Fab Four model
is compatible with local inhomogeneities is to consider self-
gravitating matter conﬁgurations, and in particular static or
rotating neutron stars (NSs). The main goal of this paper is
precisely to investigate the existence and properties of slowly
rotating NS solutions in Fab Four gravity.

The structure and stability of rotating NSs in GR (George)
is, of course, textbook material [41–43]. In the past few years
there has been signiﬁcant progress in our understanding of
slowly [44] and rapidly rotating [45, 46] NSs in Einstein-
dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (Ringo), and there are also stud-
ies of stellar stability under odd-parity (axial) perturbations in
this theory [47]. Recent investigations turned to theories with
nonminimal coupling to the Einstein tensor (John) [48–50].
Here we complete and extend the analysis of NSs in the John
subclass, and we look for solutions in theories containing the
Paul term. We were unable to obtain NS solutions in theories
involving the Paul term. Apparently, Paul doesn’t want to be
a star.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we derive
the stellar structure equations at ﬁrst order in a slow-rotation
expansion in generic shift-symmetric Horndeski theories. In
Section III we specialize our analysis to each of the Fab Four
subcases. In Section IV we summarize our ﬁndings and point
out possible directions for future research. Appendix A dis-
cusses the relation between the moment of inertia and the stel-
lar compactness in theories of the Ringo and John subclasses.
Throughout the paper, unless speciﬁed otherwise, we will use
geometrical units (G = c = 1).

II. SLOWLY ROTATING STARS IN FAB FOUR THEORY

In this section we will consider the shift-symmetric sub-
class of Horndeski’s theory which is invariant under the trans-
formation

φ → φ + c ,

(10)

where c is a constant. From Eqs. (9), this assumption im-
plies that Vjohn, Vpaul and Vgeorge must be constant, while the
Ringo (EdGB) term Vringo can be a linear function of φ. For
EdGB, a constant shift in φ only adds a trivial topological in-
variant to the action, and therefore it does not affect the ﬁeld
equations. Eqs. (4) and (5) represent the basic building blocks
of our theory, which will be described by the general action

S = SG + SM ,

(11)

where SM the ordinary action for ﬂuid matter, and SG is a
combination of the Lagrangians (5c)-(5b).

To investigate slowly rotating solutions we follow the ap-
proach described by Hartle and Thorne [37, 38], in which spin
corrections are considered as small perturbations on an other-
wise static, spherically symmetric background. In particular,
at ﬁrst order in the star’s angular velocity Ω the metric can be
written as

In Table I we show the radius R and compactness C ≡ M/R

NSs with the “canonical” mass M = 1.4 M(cid:12) constructed us-
ing different EOS models in GR. At ﬁxed mass, the realistic
EOSs APR, SLy4 and GNH3 (in this order) yield conﬁgura-
tions with decreasing compactness, and therefore larger mo-
ment of inertia.

where ˜ω(r) is the angular velocity of the ﬂuid as measured by
a freely falling observer.

Varying the action (11) with respect to the metric and the
scalar ﬁeld we obtain the equations of motion for gαβ and φ,
respectively:

where

Eαβ = Tαβ ,

Eφ = 0 ,

Tαβ = ( + p)uαuβ + pgαβ

(13)

(14)

is the energy-momentum tensor of a perfect ﬂuid. Here 
and p are the energy density and pressure of a ﬂuid ele-
ment with four-velocity uµ = u0(1, 0, 0, Ω). The time com-
√
ponent u0 follows directly from the normalization condition
uµuµ = −1, which leads for the metric (12) to u0 = 1/
A.
The explicit form of Eαβ and Eφ can be found in the Appendix
of [36] (see [34] for a particular study in the case of John).

Moreover,

in the Jordan frame,

the energy-momentum

tensor is conserved:

∇µT µν = 0 .

(15)

To close the system of equations we need to specify the equa-
tion of state (EOS) for the NS, i.e. a relation between the
pressure and energy density:

p = p() .

(16)

Taken together, Eqs. (13), (15) and (16) provide the full de-
scription of a slowly rotating star.

In this work we will consider three realistic EOSs, namely
APR [51], SLy4 [52] and GNH3 [53] in decreasing order of
stiffness. To facilitate comparisons with [48, 50] we will also
consider a polytropic EOS of the form P = KρΓ, with K =

III. FAB FOUR NEUTRON STARS

In this section we discuss NSs in the four subclasses of Fab

Four gravity, starting from the simplest Lagrangians.

A. George

(General Relativity)

The George Lagrangian for shift-symmetric theories cor-
responds to GR, so we refer the reader to standard treatments
of rotating stars [41–43].

B. Ringo

(Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity)

Nonrotating hairy BH solutions in EdGB gravity with a
dilatonic coupling of the schematic form Vringo ∼ ζeγφ were
found by Kanti et al. [54]. These solutions were then exten-
ded to slowly and rapidly rotating BHs [44, 55]. As stated in
the introduction, Sotiriou and Zhou [28, 29] pointed out that
hairy BH solutions exist in shift-symmetric EdGB theories, in
violation of the Hui-Nicolis no-hair theorem (see [36] for an
extension of these results to linear order in a slow-rotation ap-
proximation). Shift-symmetric EdGB theories can be seen as
a small-ﬁeld Taylor series expansion of the dilatonic coupling

Vringo (cid:39) ζ + ζγφ ,

(18)

where the constant term ζ can be neglected since it gives rise
to a topological invariant at the level of the action.

NSs in EdGB gravity with a dilatonic coupling were stud-
ied in [44–46] (see also [47] for axial perturbations). As it

turns out, the bulk properties of NSs depend only on the com-
bination ζγ: cf. the discussion around Eq. (29) of [44]. This
is because the value of the scalar ﬁeld is typically very small
within the star, and therefore the Taylor expansion (18) is an
excellent approximation. For this reason, the analysis of NSs
in Ref. [44] applies also to the shift-symmetric case of interest
here, and we refer the reader to the treatment in that paper for
calculations of stellar structure and observational bounds on
the product ζγ.

(Nonminimal Coupling with the Einstein Tensor)

C. John

A more interesting case are slowly rotating compact stars in
theories with a nonminimal derivative coupling with the Ein-
stein tensor, corresponding to the John Lagrangian (5c) [48–
50]. These theories are described by the action

where LK = βX = −(β∂µφ∂µφ)/2 is a kinetic term for the

can be obtained from the Horndeski Lagrangian by choosing

G2 = βX, G4 = κ +

η

X , G3 = G5 = 0 .

(20)

We also consider a real scalar ﬁeld of the form [35]

φ(r, t) = qt + ψ(r) ,

(21)

where q is a constant scalar charge. With this choice, the
ﬁeld’s kinetic energy is a function of r only:

(cid:20) q2

A(r)

X =

2

(cid:21)

− B(r)ψ(cid:48)(r)2

.

(22)

In vacuum, the theory described by the action (19) leads
to asymptotically AdS black hole solutions with a nontrivial
scalar ﬁeld conﬁguration [30–32, 35, 39]. However, it has re-
cently been shown that it is possible to construct “stealth” NS
models for which the exterior solution is given by the Schwar-
zschild spacetime [48].

For β = 0, the scalar ﬁeld outside the star (where Tµν = 0)
does not backreact on the metric, leading to “stealth solu-
tions”. However inside the star (where Tµν (cid:54)= 0) the scalar
ﬁeld has a nontrivial effect, and the stellar structure is differ-
ent from GR.

Hereafter we will focus on these stealth solutions, ﬁxing
β = 0. We recall that the action (19) is invariant under shift
symmetry (φ → φ + c). This allows us to write the equation
of motion for the scalar ﬁeld in terms of a conserved current
J µ:

∇µJ µ = 0 ,

(23)

with nonzero components given by

J t = − qη

mits the solution

J r =

(26)

with C1 constant. In the following we will set C1 = 0, as it
has been shown that this choice is consistent with a vanishing
radial energy ﬂux, i.e. Etr = 0 [56].

Combining Eqs. (15), (25) and the (tt) and (rr) compon-
ents of Eqs. (13) we obtain a set of differential equations for
the spherically symmetric background. Moreover, at linear or-
der in the angular velocity, the (tϕ) equation Etϕ − Ttϕ = 0
yields a differential equation for ˜ω. In summary, a slowly ro-
tating NS at ﬁrst order in the slow-rotation approximation is
described by the following set of equations:

Figure 1. Mass-radius curves for different EOS models, selected values of q∞, and η = ±1. The various panels correspond to EOS APR
(top-left), SLy4 (top-right), GNH3 (bottom-left) and a polytropic (bottom-right). Conﬁgurations with radii smaller than that identiﬁed by the
orange cross do not satisfy the condition (34). The horizontal colored band corresponds to M = 2.01 ± 0.04 M(cid:12), the most massive NS mass
known to date [57]. Note that the various panels have different x-axis ranges.

From these expansions we can obtain constraints that must
be satisﬁed by q2η to obtain physically acceptable solutions.
If we demand that p(cid:48)(cid:48)(r) < 0 [58], we obtain

q2η <

(33)

which is automatically satisﬁed when η < 0, but sets an upper
bound on q2η when η > 0. On the other hand, the require-
ment that the derivative of the scalar ﬁeld should be real, i.e.
(φ(cid:48))2 > 0, implies

on q2 |η|, namely

To construct NS models we integrate the system of equa-
tions (27)-(29), supplemented by the boundary conditions

(32a)-(32c), from r = 0 up to the star’s radius r = R,
which corresponds to the point where the pressure vanishes,
i.e. p(R) = 0. Then we match the interior solution to the
exterior Schwarzschild metric. The NS mass is obtained by
solving the system

where A∞ is an integration constant. Then we rescale the time
variable (t → t
A∞) so that it represents the coordinate time
measured by an observer at inﬁnity. Because of the linear de-
pendence of the scalar ﬁeld on t, we correspondingly rescale
q as

q∞ =

.

(37)

The stellar structure equations depend only on the combina-
tion q2η, so we can set η = ±1 without loss of generality. The
scalar ﬁeld is computed from Eq. (31) for families of solutions
with ﬁxed values of q∞. To facilitate comparisons with [48],

Figure 2. Moment of inertia I as a function of the mass M. The various panels correspond to EOS APR (top-left), SLy4 (top-right), GNH3
(bottom-left) and a polytropic (bottom-right). Conﬁgurations with masses larger than that identiﬁed by the orange cross do not satisfy the
condition (34).

here we choose these values to be 0, 0.032 and 0.064. To ob-
tain the solutions we apply a shooting method, adjusting the
value q in each integration until we obtain the desired value of
q∞.

We also integrate Eq. (30) for a given ˜ωc and we compute
the star’s angular velocity Ω and its angular momentum J,
requiring that at the surface

˜ω(R) = Ω − 2J
R3 ,

˜ω(cid:48)(R) =

6J
R4 .

(38)

The moment of inertia is computed through I = J/Ω. We
note that rescaling ˜ω(r) by a constant factor does not affect
Eq. (30). Therefore, once the solution ˜ωold has been found for
given initial conditions, yielding a value Ωold, a new solution
˜ωnew can immediately be found via ˜ωnew = ˜ωoldΩnew/Ωold.
The moment of inertia I is independent of the star’s angular
velocity.

In Fig. 1 we show the mass-radius diagram for all the EOS
models used in this paper. The polytropic case (bottom-right
panel) matches the results in [48], except for what we believe
to be a mislabeling of some curves in their Fig. 2.

As pointed out in [48], the limit q∞ → 0 does not corres-
pond to GR, and indeed the corresponding mass-radius curves
are different from those of GR (solid black lines). For any
EOS and ﬁxed q∞, positive (negative) values of η correspond
to more (less) compact conﬁgurations. At ﬁxed η, largers val-
ues of the scalar charge q∞ correspond to stellar models with
larger radii. As a reference, the horizontal colored band cor-
respond to the most massive known NS, PSR J0348+0432,
with M = 2.01 ± 0.04 M(cid:12) [57]. When η > 0, for all values
of q∞ and EOS models considered in this paper such massive
NSs are not supported.

In Fig. 2 we show the moment of inertia as a function of
mass for the same stellar models and theory parameters as in
Fig. 1. In addition, in Table II we list the values of I for a
canonical NS with mass M = 1.4 M(cid:12). It is interesting that
some theories with η > 0 cannot support stars with this value
of the mass. As expected, deviations with respect to GR grow
as the scalar charge increases, yielding larger (smaller) mo-
ments of inertia for η < 0 (η > 0). The relative deviation
from GR can be of order 30% for q∞ = 0.064 and η = −1.

Table II. Moment of inertia for a NS with M = 1.4 M(cid:12) for selected
values of q∞ and for nuclear-physics motivated EOS models. For
q∞ = 0.064 and η = 1, none of the EOS models considered here
supports NSs with M = 1.4 M(cid:12).

In GR, the dimensionless moment of inertia ¯I ≡ I/M 3
was recently shown to be related to the NS compactness C by
a universal relation which is almost insensitive to the adopted
EOS [59] (see [60–63] for earlier studies):

¯Iﬁt = a1C−1 + a2C−2 + a3C−3 + a4C−4 ,

(39)

where the ﬁtting coefﬁcients ai, i = (1, . . . , 4), are listed
in [59] (Table II). This I-C relation reproduces numerical
results with an accuracy better than 3%. The observed uni-
versality is reminiscent of the I-Love-Q relations between
the moment of inertia, tidal deformability (as encoded in the
so-called Love number) and rotational quadrupole moment
Q [64, 65]. The extension of these near-universal relations
I-C relations to theories of the Ringo and John subclasses is
discussed in Appendix A.

It is natural to ask whether these stealth NS models are
stable. Vacuum, static, spherically symmetric solutions where
the scalar ﬁeld has a linear time dependence were shown to
be free from ghost and gradient instabilities under odd-parity
gravitational perturbations as long as the following conditions
are met [66]:

Here we have used X = q2/(2A∞) as well as Eq. (37), which
applies to the stealth BH solutions of [35]. For stealth BH
solutions A → 0 in the vicinity of the event horizon, therefore
the third term on the right-hand side of Eqs. (41) and (42) is
the dominant one. As a consequence FG < 0, suggesting that
these solutions are generically unstable [66].

8

A similar argument can be applied to our stealth NS solu-
tions. In the exterior vacuum spacetime of the star, the metric
function A, which satisﬁes A < A∞, remains positive and
ﬁnite. When η is positive, G is always positive as well, and
the conditions F > 0 and H > 0 everywhere outside the star
translate into

q2∞η < 4κ

respectively, where we have used Eq. (36).

We have numerically conﬁrmed that all NS models presen-
ted in Fig. 1 satisfy the conditions (44) and (45) for the largest
value of q∞ = 0.064 considered in this paper. For a typical
NS the compactness is C ≈ 0.2, and the right-hand side of
Eq. (44) is approximately 0.035, which is much larger than
0η = 0.0642 ≈ 0.004. The condition (44)
our choice q2
will be violated only for an unrealistically compact NS with
C ≈ 0.45. This suggests that hypothetical ultracompact ob-
jects – such as Lemaitre stars [65, 67, 68] and gravastars [69–
71] – may be unstable in the presence of a stealth scalar ﬁeld.
Similarly, for negative values of η, F and H are always pos-
itive, and the condition G > 0 is satisﬁed everywhere outside
the star if

A(R)

q2∞|η| < 4κ

(46)
We have also checked that for q∞ = 0.064 and η = −1, all
NS models presented in Fig. 1 satisfy (46). In the Newtonian
limit C (cid:28) 1, the stealth NS spacetime is stable for q2∞η < 4κ
when η > 0, and for q2∞|η| < 4κ when η < 0. For NSs
with larger values of q2∞|η| the exterior spacetime becomes
unstable everywhere, including the Newtonian regime.
It is interesting to consider the non-relativistic limit of the-
ories of the John class. Intoducing the usual mass function
m(r) such that B(r) = 1− 2m(r)/r, we see that the pressure
equation retains its standard form

(cid:18) 1 − 2C

(cid:19)

(47)

where ρ is the mass density. However the mass equation is
reduced to

dr

=

4πr2ρ

1 − 12πq2η

.

(48)

This behavior looks reminiscent of “beyond Horndeski” the-
ories [72, 73], where a partial breakdown of the Vainshtein
mechanism occurs, modifying the Newtonian limit [74]. In
fact, several authors have advocated the use of this “feature” to
constrain beyond Horndeski theories using Newtonian stars or
white dwarfs [75–79]. While those theories modify the pres-
sure equation (47) leaving the mass equation unaltered, theor-
ies of the John subclass seem to alter the Newtonian limit in
the opposite way.

However, combining Eqs. (47)-(48) and restoring the grav-

itational constant G we obtain

which is equivalent to the ordinary hydrostatic equilibrium

(50)

Therefore the nonrelativistic limit of the “John” theories con-
sidered in this section is equivalent to Newtonian gravity with
an effective gravitational constant Geﬀ. Incidentally, a sim-
ilar result was found by Cisterna et al. [50] in the context of
cosmology [cf. their Eq. (38)].

momentum conservation equation (15), which gives

form a closed system of differential equations, which can be

Let us now turn to NS solutions in theories containing the
Paul Lagrangian (5d). We start with the simplest model, given
by the combination

L = Lgeorge + Lpaul

αP µναβ∇µφ∇αφ∇ν∇βφ ,

(51)

which from Eqs. (9) corresponds to the following choice of
the functions Gi:

G2 = G3 = 0 , G4 = 1 , G5 = αX ,

(52)

where α is a coupling parameter. As in Section III C, we
consider a scalar ﬁeld with linear time dependence of the
form (21). This choice is crucial for φ(r) to have a nontrivial
proﬁle.
Indeed, the nonvanishing components of the scalar
current for the action (51) are

J r =

From the ﬁrst equation we conclude that in the limit q → 0
the condition J r = 0 implies φ(cid:48) = 0, i.e., the scalar ﬁeld must

(59c)

where A2, B2 and p2 are functions of the constant parameters
Ac and pc. Unlike Eqs. (57) and (56), which reduce to GR
for α → 0 (or q → 0), the initial conditions for the metric
functions, (φ(cid:48))2 and the pressure are ill-deﬁned.
To better understand this issue, let us reconsider the η →
0 limit of the John action.
In that case, as we see from
Eqs. (32a)-(32e), the only divergent quantity as η → 0 is the
derivative of the scalar ﬁeld φ(cid:48), while all other metric and mat-
ter quantities have a ﬁnite limit. Since we work in the Jordan
frame there is no direct coupling between the scalar ﬁeld and
matter. Furthermore the scalar ﬁeld does not backreact on the
spacetime in the “stealth” exterior, and therefore a singular
behavior of the scalar ﬁeld does not affect the geodesics of
particles outside the star.
In contrast, for the Paul case all
physical quantities diverge in the limit α → 0, indicating a
pathological behavior in the NS interior. Furthermore, at vari-
ance with the John case, we could not ﬁnd a stealth exterior
solution for Paul. Our results suggest that exterior stealth solu-
tions for Paul do not exist under the ansatz (21) for the scalar
ﬁeld.

We observed a similar behavior for other Fab Four theories
involving the Paul term. We considered the following com-
binations:

Lgeorge + Lpaul + LK , φ(r) ,
Lgeorge + Lpaul + Ljohn + LK , φ(t, r) ,
Lgeorge + Lpaul + Lringo + LK , φ(t, r) ,
Lgeorge + Lpaul + Ljohn + Lringo + LK , φ(t, r) .

(60)
(61)
(62)
(63)

In all of these cases the physical variables suffer from the same
divergence when the coupling parameter α of the Paul term
vanishes.

Appleby [40] found that the self-tuning mechanism is not
applicable for spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes in
theories of the Paul class. Our results strengthen his conclu-
sions, suggesting that the Paul term does not allow for phys-
ically well-behaved compact object solutions.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented an exhaustive study of slowly rotating
NS solutions in the shift-symmetric class of Fab Four gravity,
namely the subclass of Horndeski’s gravity which may allow
for dynamical self-tuning of the quantum vacuum energy, and
for this reason has been the subject of intense scrutiny in a cos-
mological context. Our main goal was to investigate whether
Fab Four gravity is compatible with the existence of relativ-
istic stars, such as NSs.

Among the nonminimal couplings in Fab Four gravity listed
in Eqs. (5c)-(5b) we especially focused on the John (nonmin-
imal derivative coupling to the Einstein tensor) and Paul (non-
minimal derivative coupling to the double dual of the Riemann
tensor) subclasses. This is both because George (GR) and
Ringo (EdGB gravity) have been extensively studied in the
past, and because “John” and Paul are the crucial terms allow-
ing for self-tuning of the quantum vacuum energy in cosmo-
logical scenarios.

In the case of John, if we make the assumption that the
scalar ﬁeld has a linear time dependence of the form (21),
there is a stealth solution such that the scalar ﬁeld does not
backreact on the metric in the exterior, while it introduces
nontrivial modiﬁcations of the interior stellar structure with
respect to GR in the stellar interior. Our results on spheric-
ally symmetric NSs agree with previous work [48] and extend
it to slowly rotating solutions. As pointed out in [48], in the
limit of vanishing scalar charge (q∞ → 0) the mass-radius
curves differ from GR. Irrespective of the chosen EOS, posit-
ive (negative) values of the coupling constant η in (19) yield
more (less) compact stellar conﬁgurations. For positive val-
ues of η this fact can be used to put mild (EOS dependent)
constraints on the maximum value of q∞, cf. Ref. [50].

We have also shown that

the approximately EOS-
independent relations between the moment of inertia I and
compactness C within GR break down in this theory. There-
fore, in principle, future measurements of I could potentially
constrain the value of q∞ [80]. We also obtained improved I-
C relations which depend of the value of q∞ and are accurate
within ∼ 5%.

Based on stability studies in the context of BH solu-
tions [66], we have argued that the NS models studied here
are generically stable under odd-parity gravitational perturba-
tions. A systematic study of stellar perturbations within theor-
ies of the John subclass is desirable, and it could follow in the
footsteps of similar studies for scalar-tensor theory [81–84]
and EdGB gravity [47].

Surprisingly, we also found that in all subclasses of Fab
Four and its minimal extension which involve Paul, not only
the scalar ﬁeld, but also all metric functions and the pressure
diverge at the center of the star in the small-coupling limit.
Therefore “healthy” BH and stellar solutions do not seem to
exist in the shift-symmetric Paul subclass.
It will be inter-
esting to understand whether this conclusion still holds in the
absence of shift symmetry.

As a straightforward generalization of the present work,
one could search for NS solutions in Fab Four theories where
the potentials (5c)-(5b) have nontrivial functional forms, as

10

well as in more general (non shift-symmetric) versions of
Horndeski’s theory. The general formalism developed in [36]
can be straightforwardly applied to these cases.

Barausse and Yagi [85] have recently shown that the so-
called sensitivities of compact objects [86] vanish in shift-
symmetric Horndeski gravity, which includes the Fab Four
class. Consequently the dynamics of binaries involving NSs
is, to leading post-Newtonian order, the same as in GR. It
would be interesting to understand whether these conclusion
hold at higher post-Newtonian orders, and whether gravita-
tional waves can be used at all to constrain these theories.

While we were completing this work, a similar study of
slowly rotating stars appeared on the arXiv [50]. Their work
focuses on theories of the John class and deals also with their
cosmological interpretation. Where our works overlap, they
agree with our main conclusions.

Appendix A: I-C relations

In this Appendix we discuss the relation between the mo-
ment of inertia and the compactness for NSs in theories of the
John and Ringo subclasses.

(Nonminimal Coupling with the Einstein Tensor)

1. John

The behavior of I as function of q∞ can be accurately de-

scribed by a simple quadratic ﬁt of the form

I = p0 + p1q∞ + p2q2∞ ,

(A1)

where (p0, p1, p2) are constants. In the top panel of Fig. 3 we
compare this relation with numerical data for η = −1 (note
that for this ﬁgure we have computed models with additional
values of q∞, that were not displayed in Figs. 1 and 2 to avoid
cluttering). The bottom panel of Fig. 3 shows that the relative
errors between the numerical data and the ﬁt are typically of
order 0.1% or smaller.

To understand whether these relations hold also for theories
of the John subclass, we have compared our numerical data
against Eq. (39), computing the relative error ∆ ¯I/ ¯I = |1 −
¯Iﬁt/ ¯I|. The results are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4.
Errors are always larger than in GR, and they can be as high
as 40% for low-compactness conﬁgurations. A similar trend is

Figure 4. Top panel: ¯I-C relation for different values of the scalar
charge q∞ and the realistic EOS APR (blue), GNH3 (red), SLy4
(green). The solid curve represents the ﬁt given by Eq. (39), ob-
tained in [59]. Bottom panel: relative errors between the numerical
data and the analytic relation. For illustrative purposes, we show the
cases q∞ = 0 and q∞ = 0.064. For the latter deviations from GR
are more dramatic.

Figure 3. Top panel: the moment of inertia I versus charge q∞ for
a canonical NS with M = 1.4 M(cid:12) and η = −1, and the realistic
EOSs APR, GNH3 and SLy4. Bottom panel: Relative percentage
errors between the numerical data and the relation (A1).

It

observed for the I-Love-Q relations in GR in [87]. Deviations
from the GR relation are due to the strong dependence of the
star’s bulk properties on the scalar charge q∞, which spoils
the (approximate) EOS universality of the relation proposed
in [59]. Therefore we conclude that a theory-independent ﬁt
would perform poorly.
is still possible to introduce approximately EOS-
independent relations for I-C at ﬁxed values of the theory
parameters q∞ and η using the functional form given in
Eq. (39). The relative errors between the numerical data and
these ﬁts are shown in Fig. 5, and the corresponding ﬁtting
coefﬁcients are listed in Table III. For almost all conﬁgura-
tions the new relations perform better than Eq. (39), with rel-
ative errors which can be an order of magnitude smaller.

2. Ringo

(Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity)

We have also investigated the I-C relations for theories of
the Ringo subclass (EdGB gravity) using the numerical data
from [44]. We found that the ﬁt proposed in [59] works

remarkably well for EdGB, with relative percentage errors
(cid:46) 10% for a wide range of compactness. This result is com-
plementary to the I-Q relations in EdGB obtained in [45]. We
recall, however, that our calculations are limited to slow ro-
tation. The question of whether or not rapidly rotating NSs
in EdGB satisfy the same I-C relations of [59] could be ad-
