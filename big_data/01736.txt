Abstract

A superpattern is a string of characters of length n that contains
as a subsequence, and in a sense that depends on the context, all the
smaller strings of length k in a certain class. We prove structural and
probabilistic results on superpatterns for preferential arrangements,
including (i) a theorem that demonstrates that a string is a superpat-
tern for all preferential arrangements if and only if it is a superpattern
for all permutations; and (ii) a result that is reminiscent of a still un-
resolved conjecture of Alon on the smallest permutation on [n] that
contains all k-permutations with high probability.

Introduction and Statement of Results

A superpattern is a string of characters of length n that contains as a subse-
quence, and in a sense that depends on the context, all the smaller strings
of length k in a certain class. Speciﬁcally, given a set X and a class R such
that each object in R is a string of k elements in X, a superpattern is a string
that contains all p ∈ R as subsequences. For example, with X = {1, 2} and
R = {11, 12, 21, 22},

1221

is a superpattern.

In this paper, we present some results on superpatterns for preferential
arrangements, or word-patterns. Key references in this area are [3], [5],
and [8]. Preferential arrangements (p.a.’s) of length k over X = [d]
:=

1

{1, 2, . . . , d} are k-strings with entries from [d], for which order isomorphic
representations are considered to be equivalent. For example if k = 3, d = 2,
there are seven preferential arrangements, viz. 111, 112, 121, 211, 122, 212,
and 221. If k = d = 3, the thirteen preferential arrangements (enumerated
whenever d = k by the ordered Bell numbers) are 112, 121, 211, 122, 212, 221,
111, and the six permutations 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, and 321. Note that,
for example, the strings 112, 113, and 223 are order isomorphic, so above
we just list the preferential arrangement 112, expressed in the traditional
lexicographically minimal fashion, also known as a dense ranking system. If
k = 3, d ≥ 4, there are still only 13 p.a.’s, since, for example, with k = 3 and
d = 4, the six strings 112, 113, 114, 223, 224, 334 are each equivalent to the
p.a. 112.

A superpattern for preferential arrangements of length k over [d] is an
n-long string over the alphabet [d], that contains, as a subsequence, each
of the preferential arrangements of length k over [d] in any one of its order
isomorphic forms. For example, a string such as 3213213 is a superpattern
for k = d = 3 or with k = 3; d = 4, and 1231241 is a superpattern with,
e.g., k = 3; d = 5 or k = 3; d = 4. Let n(k, d) be the length of the shortest
superpattern for all p.a.’s of length k over [d].

Now, let us deﬁne what we consider to be another natural object: Let
ν(k, d) be the length of shortest superpattern for k-long p.a.’s when each of
the letters in [d] must be used at least once in the superpattern. For k = 3,
the examples 1231231, 1231241, and 2353134, as well as the fact that the p.a.
111 can never occur with n = 7; d ≥ 6 show that ν(3, d) = 7 for d = 3, 4, 51
and that ν(3, d) = 7 + (d − 5) for d ≥ 6. For k = 4 the situation is more
complex: We have ν(4, 4) = 12, as seen in Section 2, but ν(4, 6) ≤ 11, as seen
via the example 43514342634. This example also shows that the assertion in
[3] that n(k, d) = n(k, k) for d > k needs further qualiﬁcation.

Open Question 1. For ﬁxed small values of k, d, calculate ν(k, d). Establish
upper and lower bounds on ν(k, d).

The fact that n(3, 3) = 7 (tacitly used above) is elementary and has been
shown, e.g., in [9] (in which the rather complicated waiting time distribution
for a random string on {1, 2, 3} to become a 3-superpattern was also studied),

1Technically, we have just shown that ν(3, 4) ≤ 7; ν(3, 5) ≤ 7. A proof that these values

equal 7 is not too diﬃcult, and is omitted.

2

and the authors of [3] conjectured that n(k, k) = k2 − 2k + 4 for each k, a
fact that we prove for k = 4 in Section 2 of this paper. In the main result
of Section 2, Theorem 1, we prove that for each k, n(k, k) = ρ(k, k) =
ρ(k), where ρ(k) is the shortest superpattern with entries from the alphabet
{1, 2, . . . , k} that contains all the permutations of length k. This somewhat
surprising result has ramiﬁcations: It was shown in [12] that the quantity
⌈k2 − 7
3 ⌉, which is smaller than k2 − 2k + 4 for k ≥ 10, is an upper
bound for ρ(k). Since, via Theorem 1, ρ(k) and n(k, k) are the same, this
disproves the k2 − 2k + 4 conjecture.

3k + 19

The ﬁrst paper to make the k2 − 2k + 4 conjecture was [11], where this
conjecture was presented as one of two. The other conjecture, which, at the
present time appears to be the best candidate for the true value of n(k, k),
is

n(k) = n(k, k) =

In the rest of the paper as well, we will focus on the case k = d.

In
Section 3, we generalize the work of [1] and [9] by exhibiting tight bounds
on the expected waiting time until a random string, with each letter being
independently and uniformly chosen from [k], becomes a superpattern for k-
long preferential arrangements (or permutations) over [k]. The waiting time
is shown to be tightly concentrated around its mean. This result recalls the
Alon Conjecture from [2], which states that the value n = k2
4 is the threshold
for a random permutation on [n] to contain each of the k! k-permutations
in an order isomorphic form – with high or low probability. In our result,
the parent string contains repetitions, but the net result is still that each
k-permutation must appear in a non-isomorphic form. As seen, e.g, in [4],
Alon’s conjecture is notoriously hard – but perhaps an approach exempliﬁed
by Theorem 1 might yield dividends.

2 Length and Structure of Superpatterns

In this section we will focus on the case k = d, and consider n(k), the length of
the shortest word on the alphabet [k] containing all preferential arrangements

3

of length k. We again consider ρ(k), the length of the shortest word on the
alphabet [k] containing all permutations of the elements of [k]. We ﬁrst
observe that n(k) = ρ(k) for 3 ≤ k ≤ 7, and then show that n(k) = ρ(k) for
each k.

It is shown in [3] that n(k) ≤ k2−2k+4 for all k, and it is conjectured that
this upper bound is actually an equality. That it is a lower bound for ρ(k)
when 3 ≤ k ≤ 7 was established in [11], and since ρ(k) ≤ n(k), the equality
between n(k) and ρ(k) holds at least through k = 7. We begin by establishing
a general lower bound for ρ(k) which agrees with k2 − 2k + 4 for k = 3, 4.
Even though the coeﬃcient on the leading term in Proposition 1 is 1
2, making
the bound asymptotically inferior to the bound n(k) ≥ k2 − c(ǫ)k1.75+ǫ from
[7], it suﬃces for small values of k as we will see.

Proposition 1. ρ(k) ≥ k2

2 + 3k

2 − 2 for all k ≥ 2.

Proof. We will proceed by induction. As a base case, note that ρ(2, 2) = 3 =
22
2 + 3·2

2 − 2.

Now suppose the result holds for some k ≥ 2, and let σ be an arbitrary
word on the alphabet [k + 1] with length (k + 1)2/2 + 3(k + 1)/2 − 3. We
will show that σ does not contain all permutations of [k + 1]. Denote the
ﬁrst letter of σ by σ1, the second letter by σ2 and so on. Clearly, each letter
in [k + 1] must appear somewhere in σ. Let a be the last letter to appear in
σ; then a appears at the earliest as the k + 1th letter of σ. We will consider
two cases: when a ﬁrst appears as the k + 1th letter of σ and when a ﬁrst
appears after the k + 1th letter.

In the ﬁrst case, the subword σ1σ2...σk+1 contains all elements of [k + 1]
exactly once, so the a appearing as the k + 1th letter of σ cannot be a part
of any permutation beginning with σ2σ1a. Since k + 1 ≥ 3, permutations of
this form must exist, so a appears later on in σ as well. Thus, there are at
most (k+1)2
2 − 3 letters following the ﬁrst a
which are not a. However, σ contains all permutations of [k + 1] beginning
with a, so it must contain all permutations of [k +1]\{a} following the ﬁrst a.
But, by the induction hypothesis, k2
2 − 3 are insuﬃciently many letters
to contain all the permutations of k letters.

2 − 3 − (k + 2) = k2

2 + 3(k+1)

2 + 3k

2 + 3k

In the second case, a ﬁrst occurs at the earliest as the k + 2th letter of σ,
so it has at most (k+1)2
2 − 3 letters following
it. As before, σ must contain all permutations of [k + 1]\a following the

2 − 3 − (k + 2) = k2

2 + 3(k+1)

2 + 3k

4

ﬁrst a, but, again, k2
2 − 3 are insuﬃciently many letters to contain all
the permutations of k letters. Thus, σ does not contain all permutations of
[k + 1].

2 + 3k

The fact that ρ(k) = n(k) for 1 ≤ k ≤ 7 (the 1 and 2 cases are trivial)
suggests that this equality may hold for all k, and, in fact it does. Proving
this, however, requires two new deﬁnitions. For Deﬁnitions 1-2 and Theorem
1, let Ak = {a1, . . . , ak} be an arbitrary subset of N with |Ak| = k and
a1 < a2 < ... < ak.

Deﬁnition 1. A regular occurrence of a preferential arrangement in a word
on the alphabet Ak is an occurrence of that arrangement such that for each
letter, supposing there are i letters in the p.a. that are less than that letter
and j copies of that letter in the p.a., the letter is represented in the word by
some element of {ai+1, ai+2, ..., ai+j}.

For instance, if our alphabet is [6], then a regular occurrence of 112232
is one in which the 1s are represented by 1s or 2s, the 2s are represented
by 3s, 4s, or 5s, and the 3 is represented by a 6. So, 113363 and 225565 are
regular occurrences of 112232, but 113343 is not. Then, a regular superpattern
of length k p.a.’s on [k] is deﬁned to be a string that contains a regular
occurrence of all p.a.’s.

Deﬁnition 2. A complete word on Ak is a word on Ak containing every
permutation of the elements of Ak. So, ρ(k) is the length of the shortest
complete word on [k].

Note that this second deﬁnition comes from a body of literature including,
for example, [12]. Now, let CAk be the set of complete words on Ak, let SAk be
the set of superpatterns of length k preferential arrangements on Ak, and let
RAk be the set of regular superpatterns of length k preferential arrangements
on Ak.

Theorem 1. For all Ak with k ≥ 2, CAk = SAk = RAk .

Proof. It is clear that RAk ⊆ SAk ⊆ CAk, so it remains to show that CAk ⊆
RAk. We proceed by induction. As a base case, note that for A2 any σC ∈ CA2

5

contains either the subsequence a1a2a1 or a2a1a2, so σC ∈ RA2. Now suppose
that CAk−1 ⊆ RAk−1. Choose any Ak (hereafter, we simply call this set A),
choose some σC ∈ CA, and let π be an arbitrary preferential ordering of length
k. Let π′ be the portion of π following its ﬁrst letter. We will now ﬁnd a
regular occurence of π in σC in both of two cases.

C ∈ CB. By the induction hypothesis, then, σ′

Case 1: Suppose that the ﬁrst letter in π occurs just once in π. Call this
ﬁrst letter c, and let i be the number of letters in π less than c. Then, any
regular occurrence of π represents c using ai+1. Now, let B = A\{ai+1} =
{b1, b2, ..., bk−1} where b1 < b2 < ... < bk−1. Note that bj = aj for j < i + 1
and bj = aj+1 for j ≥ i + 1. Now, let σ′
C be the portion of σC following its
ﬁrst occurrence of ai+1 with all the ai+1’s removed. Since σC ∈ CA, it follows
that σ′
C ∈ RB, so it contains
a regular occurrence of π′. We claim that appending ai+1 to the beginning
of this occurrence gives a regular occurrence of π. First, consider any letter
d < c. Suppose there are j instances of d in π and d is greater than l other
letters in π noting that l + j ≤ i must hold. Then, d must be represented in
our regular occurrence of π′ by some element of {al+1, ..., al+j}. Since there
are also j instances of d and l letters less than d in π′, we know that d is
represented in the regular occurrence of π′ by some element of {bl+1, ..., bl+j},
and this set is equivalent to {al+1, ..., al+j} because all the indices are less
than i + 1. Now consider c. For our occurrence to be regular, c must be
represented using ai+1, and it is. Finally consider d > c. Again, suppose
there are j instances of d in π and d is greater than l other letters in π
noting that, this time, l ≥ i + 1. As before, d must be represented in our
regular occurrence by some element of {al+1, ..., al+j}. Now, though, there
are j instances of d and l − 1 letters less than d in π′, so d is represented in
the regular occurrence of π′ by some element of {bl, ..., bl+j−1}, and this set
is equivalent to {al+1, ..., al+j} because all indices are at least i + 1. Thus,
each letter in π is correctly represented, and we have a regular occurrence.

Case 2: Suppose that the ﬁrst letter in π occurs p times with p > 1. Call
this ﬁrst letter c, and let i be the number of letters in π less than c. Then,
any regular occurrence of π represents c using an element of {ai+1, ..., ai+p}.
Let at be the last of those elements to make its ﬁrst appearance in σC, and let
σ′
C be the portion of σC following the ﬁrst occurrence of at with all subsequent
at’s removed. As in case 1, let B = A\{at} = {b1, b2, ..., bk−1} where b1 <
b2 < ... < bk−1 and note that bj = aj for j < t and bj = aj+1 for j ≥ t. Now,
σ′
C ∈ CB, and by the induction hypothesis, CB ⊆ RB, so σ′
C contains a regular
occurrence of π′. Since there are p − 1 occurrences of c and i letters less than

6

c in π′, c must be represented in our regular occurrence by some element of
{bi+1, ..., bi+p−1} which is equivalent to {ai+1, ..., ai+p}\{at}. Let as be the
element in this set which represents c, and note that it must occur before the
ﬁrst appearance of at by our choice of at. We will show that appending as to
the beginning of the regular occurrence of π′ gives a regular occurrence of π.
As already noted, c is represented by as ∈ {ai+1, ..., ai+p}, and for any d < c,
the proof that d is correctly represented is identical to the proof in case 1.
For d > c, suppose there are j instances of d in π and d is greater than l
other letters in π noting that l ≥ i + p. Then, d must be represented in our
regular occurrence by some element of {al+1, ..., al+j}. There are j instances
of d and l − 1 letters less than d in π′, so d is represented in the regular
occurrence of π′ by some element of {bl, ..., bl+j−1}, and this set is equivalent
to {al+1, ..., al+j} because all indices are at least i + p ≥ t. Thus, we have
found a valid regular occurrence of π in σC.

Theorem 1 is useful in two regards. First, it allows us to apply everything
known about complete words to superpatterns of preferential arrangments.
As noted in the introduction, this immediately gives us that ⌈k2 − 7
3 k + 19
3 ⌉
is an upper bound on n(k), thereby disproving a long-standing conjecture.
Theorem 1 could also potentially help in ﬁnding lower bounds for n(k) be-
cause proving that no words of a certain length are regular superpatterns may
be easier than proving that no words are superpatterns, but this approach
has not been fruitful so far.

3 Random Superpatterns

Finally, we will prove a result regarding random superpatterns. Consider
the following random process: beginning with an empty word W , at each
timestep we choose a letter, uniformly at random, from the alphabet [k].
We then concatenate this value onto the end of W and check to see if the
augmented W is a superpattern for all k-long preferential arrangements on
[k] (or, equivalently, a complete word on [k]). We are interested in the value
of E[Xk] where Xk is the ﬁrst timestep at which W is a superpattern on [k].
This problem was ﬁrst considered by Godbole and Liendo in [9]. There, the
authors found values for E[X2] and E[X3] as well as the exact distributions
of X2 and X3; here we will apply a previous result to give a general upper
bound on E[Xk], and then prove a lower bound. These bounds will be

7

asymptotically equivalent and together prove that E[Xk] ∼ k2 log k. The
distribution of Xk appears to be intractable for k ≥ 4.

Abraham et al. consider a similar problem in [1]; they were interested in
omnisequences which must contain every k-letter word on [k], and ﬁnd that
Zk, the expected number of randomly chosen letters necessary to produce an
omnisequence is asymptotically k2 log k (with error terms as described be-
low). This work has connections to the coupon collector problem as studied
in [6], [10], and [13]; these connections carry forward to the work in this sec-
tion. Since every omnisequence of k-letter words on [k] is also a superpattern
on [k], we obtain the following corollary of Abraham’s work, where γ ≈ .577
is Euler’s constant and log denotes the natural logarithm.

Theorem 2. E[Xk] ≤ k2(log(k) + γ + O(k−1)) for all k.

The next theorem provides a similar lower bound.

Theorem 3. For all k, E[Xk] ≥ k2(log(k) + γ − 1 + O(k−1)).

Proof. Fix k, and let W be a superpattern on [k]. We will deﬁne a word
W which W must contain, and then we will calculate E[Yk], where Yk is the
number of letters used before W appears. Let k1 be the last element of [k] to
th letter of W .
make its ﬁrst appearance in W and let this appearance be the p1
Then let k2 be the last element of [k]\{k1} to make its ﬁrst appearance after
th letter of W . In general, let ki be the
wp1, and let this appearance be the p2
last element of [k]\{k1, k2, ..., ki−1} to make its ﬁrst appearance after wpi−1,
th letter of W . Now, W consists of
and let this appearance occur at the pi
k blocks; the ﬁrst block contains all letters in [k], the second block contains
all letters in [k]\{k1}, and so on. Because W is a superpattern on [k], in
particular because it contains k1k2...kk as a subsequence, it must contain W
as a subsequence. Note that the string k1k2...kk is not necessarily the last
permutation to occur; e.g., the superpattern 1231213 has k1k2k3 = 321 even
though the last permutation to appear is 213.

Now, let Yk,i be the number of timesteps needed to form the ith block
of W . This block must contain k − i + 1 distinct letters from the set
[k]\{k1, k2, ..., ki−1}. At each timestep, we add one of k possible letters; there
are k −i+1 possibilities for the ﬁrst distinct letter, and so it appears after Ti,1
timesteps where Ti,1 follows a geometric distribution with parameter k−i+1
.

k

8

Then, there are k − i possibilities for the second distinct letter and so on.
Therefore, to ﬁnd the jth distinct letter requires waiting Ti,j timesteps, where
Ti,j follows a geometric distribution with parameter k−i−j+2
. Thus, we have
that

Therefore, E[Xk] ≥ E[Yk] ≥ k2(log(k) + γ − 1 + O(k−1))).

Corollary 3.1. As k → ∞, E[Xk] ∼ k2 log(k).

We are also interested in the concentration of Xk about its mean;

in
particular we would like to ﬁnd a lower bound which Xk exceeds with high
probability and an upper bound which Xk falls below with high probabil-
ity. A conjecture of Noga Alon states that for a random permutation of [n]
to contain all k! permutations of [k] with high probability, one must have
n = k2
4 (1 + o(1)) [2]. While this conjecture has remained open for ﬁfteen
years, we will prove an analogue regarding superpatterns of superpatterns of
preferential arrangements (equivalently superpatterns of permutations) when
restricted to the alphabet [k]. As in the previous proof, we will ﬁnd it useful
to work with Yk instead of Xk, and the ﬁrst step is to bound the variance of
Yk.

9

Theorem 4. var(Yk) = Θ(k3).

Proof. The proof closely follows the proof of the previous theorem. As before,
we begin by calculating var[Yk,i]. Recall that each Yk,i is the sum of random
variables Ti,j each of which follows a geometric distribution with parameter
k−i−j+2
. Note that the Yk,i are all mutually independent, as are all the Ti,j.

The corresponding result for Zk, i.e. that var[Zk] = Θ(k3) is also proved
by Abraham et al.
in [1]. Now that we have a handle on the variances of
Yk and Zk, we use Chebyshev’s inequality to ﬁnd bounds between which Xk
falls with high probability.

Theorem 5. With high probability, we have that k2 log k − (1 − γ)k2 −
ω(1)k
2 where ω(1) is any sequence tending
to ∞.

2 ≤ Xk ≤ k2 log k + γk2 + ω(1)k

Proof. We begin by showing that P [Yk > k2 log k − (1 − γ)k2 − ω(1)k
It holds that

P [Zk ≥ k2 log k + γk2 + ω(1)k

Since Yk ≤ Xk ≤ Zk, these two inequalities suﬃce to show that k2 log k −
(1 − γ)k2 − ω(1)k

2 ≤ Xk ≤ k2 log k + γk2 + ω(1)k

2 with high probability.

Therefore, Xk lies, with high probability, in an interval of length k2 around
its expected value. It would be interesting to be able to nail down better
