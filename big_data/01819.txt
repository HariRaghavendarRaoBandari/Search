Abstract—One of

the foremost challenges in modulation
scheme for molecular communication is positivity of the trans-
mission signal (only a positive concentration of molecules can
be released in the environment). This restriction makes handling
of the InterSymbol Interference (ISI) a challenge for molecular
communication. In this paper, a novel modulation is proposed
which introduces use of negative signals to ameliorate the
transmission link performance. A precoder scheme based on
the diffusion channel model
is proposed and shown to have
a signiﬁcant improvement compared to previous modulation
schemes such as CSK and MCSK.

I. INTRODUCTION

Nano communication is a challenge in the design of nano-
scale machines, which are envisioned for their applications
in health, biomedicine, industry and, environment engineered
systems, etc [1]. Inspired by biological systems, Diffusion-
based Molecular Communication System (DbMCS) has been
proposed as a potential solution for nano-network communi-
cations. In such systems, molecules are used as information
carriers instead of the electromagnetic waves. Information may
be encoded in the number (CSK) [2], type (MoSK) [3] or
number and type (MCSK) [4].

In recent years, there have been intensive works on var-
ious aspects of diffusion based molecular communications,
including transmitter and receiver designs [5], [13] and mul-
tiple access protocols [6]. Albeit the problem of molecular
communication has received signiﬁcant attention, the problem
of optimum transmitter and receiver is still in progress in
the context of molecular communications due to the adverse
impact of InterSymbol Interference (ISI).

While ISI is a common issue in classical communications, it
is more challenging and prominent in the context of molecular
communication. This is due to the fact that molecular com-
munication systems are positive systems, i.e., transmitter can
only release a positive amount of concentration of a speciﬁc
molecule into the medium. Due to this fact, consecutive
transmissions at the transmitter side can only increase the
concentration of molecules at the receiver side.

One approach to handle negative signals is to add a constant
value (dc term) to both negative and positive transmission
concentrations to make all transmitted concentrations positive.
For instance to transmit messages of −10 and 10, we can con-
sider a dc term of 10, i.e., making transmitted concentrations
as 0 and 20 for negative and positive messages, respectively.
However, this will increase the expected number of transmitted
molecules (transmission power) and is not appropriate. In [7],

negative signals are handled by assuming that the input signal
is the derivative of molecule concentration. The derivative of a
positive signal can be both positive and negative. Thus, when
we want to send positive signals, it is suggested to increase
the current level of diffusion and if we want to send negative
signals, we reduce the current level of transmission. However,
the fact that the input signal has to be the derivative of some
non-negative wave form, does impose restrictions on the input
signal. How this constraint translates into the Fourier domain
is a challenge in employing the model of [7]. Other promising
ideas suggested in the literature to simulate negative signals
exploit a unique opportunity that molecular communication
provides, namely chemical reactions. The general idea is that
when molecules of different type bond together, they produce
new molecule types and reduce the concentration of original
molecule types. In [8], the release of enzymes throughout the
environment to put down the remaining molecular concentra-
tion from previous transmissions is proposed. However, this
would also weaken the direct link between the transmitter
and the receiver and would imply higher transmission powers.
Chemical reactions are also employed in design of molecular
logic gates like XOR, where the existence of two molecules
negative each other [9]. Most recently in [10], the idea of
using H+ and OH− ions is proposed wherein transmitting
each of these ions reduces the concentration of the other one
in the medium. Therefore these ions can play roles of positive
and negative signals. The main challenge of this system is
the resulting nonlinear diffusion equations which describe the
system model, making its analytical analysis a challenging
problem.

Our goal is to ﬁnd a solution to simulate the effect of
negative signals such that the resulting system still remains
linear. The property of linearity will allow us to apply classical
communication approaches, such as spectral transformations,
for communication and detection paradigms in the general
multiple transmitter and multiple receivers setting. In partic-
ular, this scheme will permit us to use a precoder ﬁlter to
compensate the adverse effects of the channel.

To sum this up, previous works consider three solutions:
adding a dc, use of derivative, and chemical reactions. Here,
we propose to exploit the fact that any arbitrary real signal is
the difference of two positive signals. The idea is to use two
different types of molecules (denoted by molecules A and B)
for positive and negative transmissions. In other words, when
we would like to send a positive signal, we release molecules

of type A, and for sending a negative signal, we release
molecules of type B. The difference between the concentration
of molecule A and molecule B at any location is viewed as the
information signal at that location. In contrast to [8], [10], this
approach, which we call Type based Sign (TS) modulation,
does not require the use chemical reactions in principle.
However, we also propose a variant of our scheme that does
utilize chemical reactions, and this leads to improvement in
detector performance. This approach allows us to cancel ISI
via a precoder.

II. PROPOSED TYPE BASED SIGN MODULATION SCHEME
Consider diffusion of molecules A and B over an environ-
ment with time-invariant ﬂow velocity v((cid:126)r) of the medium at
location (cid:126)r. The second law of diffusion [7] states that
= DA∇2CA(t, (cid:126)r) − ∇ · (v((cid:126)r)CA(t, (cid:126)r)),
= DB∇2CB(t, (cid:126)r) − ∇ · (v((cid:126)r)CB(t, (cid:126)r)),

∂CB(t, (cid:126)r)

∂CA(t, (cid:126)r)

∂t

∂t

(1)

(2)

where CA(t, (cid:126)r) and CB(t, (cid:126)r) are the concentration of
molecules A and B at time t and position (cid:126)r in the medium,
DA and DB are diffusion coefﬁcients of molecules A and
B respectively. Let us assume that DA = DB = D. By
subtracting (2) from (1) we have:
∂(CA − CB)

= D∇2(CA − CB) − ∇ · (v((cid:126)r)(CA − CB)),
(3)
Thus, the difference CA − CB follows a linear differential
equation, similar to (2) and (1).

∂t

Our idea is to encode information in the difference of
concentrations of molecules A and B. That is, if transmitter
wants to transmit message of x, if x > 0 then x molecules
of type A will be released, and if x < 0, then |x| molecules
of type B will be inserted into the medium. In both cases the
difference of concentrations is equal to x, i.e., CA − CB = x.
Example 1. Suppose that we want to transmitter sinusoidal
signal of x(t) = 2 sin(t) into the medium. Then Fig. 1
demonstrates the transmitted concentration of molecules A
and B over time.

At the receiver side, concentrations of both molecules A
and B are measured and their difference is considered as the
received signal. That is if c molecules of A and d molecules
of B are measured at the receiver, receiver will interpret the
value of c − d as the received signal.

Now, let us assume for a moment that molecules of A and
B may make chemical reactions due to the following equation

A + B

k1(cid:10)
k2

Outputs

(4)

in which k1 and k2 are the rates of forward and reverse
reactions, respectively. Then, the second law of diffusion [7]
can be expressed as

∂CB
∂t

= D∇2CB − ∇ · (vCB) − k1CACB + k2

(6)

Observe that due to the product CACB,
these system of
differential equations are non-linear. However, by subtracting
the two equations (6) from (5), the non-linear terms cancel
out and we get back equation (3). Therefore, reactions of the
form (4) in which equal concentrations of molecules A and B
cancel out each other do not affect our modulation scheme.

A. Observation noise at the receiver

Unlike the classical communication,

in molecular com-
ligand receivers have signal dependent noise,

munication,

051015202530−2−1012tx(t)051015202530−2−1012ttransmission of molecules A051015202530−2−1012ttransmission of molecules Bproportional to the number of measured concentration. As the
concentration of molecules increases, the observation noise,
which is sometimes referred to as particle counting noise
[14], increases. This means that it is possible to have small
difference in concentrations of molecules A and B at the
receiver, however each one may have large concentrations;
this would degrade the decoder performance. To put down this
noise, we may use a molecule of type C at the receptor area
which together with molecules of A and B make a reaction and
disappear. That is, the receiver releases molecules of type C in
its vicinity just before making the measurements. Molecule of
type of C are such that the following chemical reaction holds:

1A + 1B + γC

k1(cid:10)
k2

Outputs

(7)

But that A or B alone with C do not form any reaction.
This would imply that release of C causes the concentration
of both A and B to drop by the same amount; but their
concentration difference will be preserved. Note that
the
chemical reaction should be one-sided to properly simulate
the subtraction operation of the molecule densities. Also, the
chemical reaction is occuring only locally around the receiver.
An example is the following reaction (for instance see [11,

Ch.17] ).

−−−−−→
CH3COCH2Br(aq) + H +(aq) + Br−(aq)

CH3COCH3(aq) + Br2(aq)

H +(aq)

(8)

in which molecules acetone (CH3COCH3), bromine (Br2)
and hydrogen ion (H +) play role of molecules A, B and C
in (7), respectively. The diffusion coefﬁcient of acetone and
bromine are equal to 1.16×10−5cm2/s and 1.18×10−5cm2/s,
respectively ( [12, p. 127]). Observe that the diffusion coefﬁ-
cients are not exactly the same, but simulation results provided
later show that diffusion coefﬁcient mismatch of up to 10
percent does not signiﬁcantly degrade the error performance.

B. Beneﬁts and drawbacks

The beneﬁt of the TS scheme is having allowed for negative
input signal while keeping the system linear. This allows
for combating ISI, as discussed below. Drawbacks include
the use of two molecule types and the loss of degrees of
freedom due to the fact that information is encoded only in
the difference of molecule densities. Nonetheless, we will see
that the TS scheme already outperforms previously proposed
schemes using two molecule types.

III. APPLICATION TO PRECODER SCHEME

Having allowed for negative input signal while keeping
the system linear, our goal is to design a proper precoder to
eliminate ISI. In this section, we assume the use of molecule
C as in (7) at the receiver to reduce the signal dependent noise
at the receiver and simplify the calculations.

To design a precoder, we restrict to a speciﬁc model for
communication channel and employ a slotted transmission
strategy. The molecular communication model considered in
this section is similar to [13] in which the communication

r (cid:107)= 2.5 × 10−7m, α = 5273, Te = 7.5µs, and Ts = 10µs.

block diagram consists of a transmitter located at the Carte-
sian coordination of [0, 0, 0]T , a molecular diffusion channel
obeying Fick’s laws of diffusion, an additive signal-dependent
particle counting noise at the output of the channel, and a
receiver located at an arbitrary Cartesian coordination of (cid:126)r
with the volume of VR. In the following, we review the
transmission, channel and reception model and then employ it
for a precoder design.
A. Transmission

We consider time slotted communication in which duration
of each slot is denoted by Ts. Information bits are encoded in
transmission levels of ak for kth time slot. At the beginning
of the k-th time slot, we emit molecules of intensity ak for
a period of Te < Ts seconds. If we show the transmission
density by s(t), we have

(cid:88)

s(t) =

ak · rect(

t − kTs

),

Te

where rect(t) = 1 for t ∈ [0, 1] and zero otherwise.
B. Channel

The transmitted concentration signal propagates through the
medium and will be received at the receiver space, complying
with the diffusion laws. That is molecular concentration varies
according to both distance between transmitter and receiver
and the time receiver is measuring the concentration. More
speciﬁcally, according to Fick’s second law of diffusion [7] in
3-dimensional medium without any reaction and drift velocity,
from (1),
the concentration of the transmitted molecules,
denoted by c((cid:126)r, t), at location (cid:126)r and at time t is described
as follows

∂c((cid:126)r, t)

∂t

= D∇2c((cid:126)r, t)

(9)

in which D is the diffusion coefﬁcient of the transmitted
molecule. By considering initial condition of c((cid:126)r, t = 0) =
δ((cid:126)r), the impulse response of the molecular diffusion channel,
i.e., h(t) is given by

where m is the total number of emitted molecules and (cid:107) . (cid:107)2
is the l2 norm.
C. Reception

The molecule concentration around the receiver, denoted by
p(t), is equal to p(t) = s(t) ∗ h(t) and ∗ is the convolution
operator. A sample of p(t) is depicted in Fig. 2, where the
intensity initially increases and then decreases. It is suggested
in [13] to take the sampling time interval Ts, at the time
instance where the peak of p(t) occurs, i.e.,

Ts = argmax

(11)
For example, the value of Ts in Fig. 2 is 1 × 10−5. With this
choice and letting pj = p(jTs), we would have

p(t).

t

p0 > p1 > ··· > pL > 0.

(12)

The value of L is taken large enough that we may practically
assume that p(kTs) = 0 ∀k > L. A new justiﬁcation for
having this choice of Ts is given in Section III-E.

The receiver measures the molecule density at time in-
incurs a signal dependent
stances kTs. This measurement
particle counting noise, which can be modeled by a Gaus-
sian distribution whose variance is proportional to the signal
amplitude [13]. Therefore samples at the receiver are taken
from z(kTs) = p(kTs) + n(kTs) where n(kTs) is the noise.
Letting zj = z(jTs) and nj = n(jTs), and using the linearity
of the system, we will have

where VR is the receiver volume [13]. Thus, the probability
density function of zj is given by:

and MCSK modulations for different values of average transmission power.

D. Precoder

The block diagram of the model introduced in the previous
part is depicted in Fig. 3 (a), where channel is modeled as
a FIR ﬁlter P (z) with L + 1 terms. In the following we
design a new precoder block to diagram at the transmission
side as depicted in Fig. 3 (b). In this scenario the transmission
levels of ak are ﬁrst fed into a causal realization of 1/P (z)
to produce the transmission symbols of bk’s. This is done to
cancel the ISI at the receiver side, giving us

where nj ∼ N (0, aj

VR

zj = aj + nj

), yielding to
zj ∼ N (aj,

aj
VR

).

(16)

(17)

Assume a simple BPSK modulation with i.i.d. and uniform
{ak} ∈ {−β, β}. However, the transmitted symbols, bk’s,
are not necessarily i.i.d. and we need to compute E{|bk|}
for the average consumed transmission power. Furthermore,
it is important to investigate the stability and causality of the
precoder ﬁlter, i.,e., is the output of 1/P (z).

and MCSK modulations for different values of average distance and different

E. Stability of the precoder

To prove the stability of the precoder, we prove that all of
the poles and zeros of 1/P (z), are inside the unit circle. To
do this, we multiply 1/P (z) by zL, which yields

M (z) =

M1(z)
M2(z)

(18)

=

where M2(z) = (cid:80)L

k=0 ckzk in which ck = pL−k and c0 <
c1 < ··· < cL by equation (12). Therefore it is enough to
show that all of the roots of M2(z) lie in the unit disk. To
show this, we use the following theorem:

Theorem 1. (Enestrom-Kakeya [15]) If all the coefﬁcients of
the polynomial g(x) = cn−1xn−1 +··· + c0 are positive reals,
then for any (complex) root ζ of this polynomial, we have

min

}.

{ ci−1

} ≤ |ζ| ≤ max
1≤i≤n−1
Considering Theorem 1, since maxi{ ci−1

{ ci−1
(19)
ci
} < 1, all roots
of M2(z) have absolute value of smaller than 1. Therefore
all poles of 1/P (z) lie inside unit disk, i.e., the ﬁlter is
bounded input/bounded output stable. Stability provides a
new justiﬁcation for choosing of the sampling time Ts as in
equation (11).
While ﬁnding an analytical expression for E{|bk|} seems
difﬁcult, one can ﬁnd an upper bound for E{|bk|}. Observe

that E{|bk|} ≤(cid:112)E{b2

k}. Thus, we need an upper bound on
the energy of bk. The i.i.d. sequence of ak is a stationary
discrete random process, which is passed through the ﬁlter
1/P (z). Therefore, the autocorrelation function and E{b2
k} can
be computed.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

For numerical results we consider transmission parameters
of m = 10−5, D = 2.2×10−9m2/s,(cid:107) r (cid:107)= 2.5×10−7m, α =
1, Te = 7.5µs, and Ts = 10µs. The time variation of p(t)
is depicted in Fig. 2. The parameters of this simulation are
chosen such that L = 8 and normalized P (z) is P (z) =
1 + 0.6z−1 + 0.4z−2 + 0.3z−3 + 0.2z−4 + 0.15z−5 + 0.1z−6 +
0.08z−7 + 0.07z−8 and VR = 5 × 10−16cm3. Also since
condition (12) holds here, the precoder ﬁlter is stable.

We consider the three modulations of CSK, MCSK and
the proposed TS with precoder. In CSK and MCSK mod-
ulations there are interference terms which are not known
at the receiver side. We freely provide this information to
the decoder and show that even with this information, the
proposed scheme outperforms both CSK and MCSK. For a
fair comparison between the proposed scheme and the CSK
and MCSK schemes, we put expected number of released
molecules in all schemes equal to each other. That is, if in CSK
and MCSK modulations, E{|ak|} = β, then in the precoder
scheme we consider E{|bk|} = β, too. Simulation results are
depicted in Fig. 4. In this ﬁgure, the worst result is for the CSK
modulation in which we use one molecule type to transmit
information bits. Figs. 5 and 6 depict the performance when
we have a mismatch in diffusion coefﬁcients. As expected,
once the value of D2/D1 deviates from 1, the probability of
error increases. However, this increase in error probability is
relatively negligible if the mismatch between D1 and D2 is
less than 10 percent.

On the other hand, the transmitter with precoder has a more
complicated design than the CSK or MCSK schemes. Fur-
thermore, in CSK and MCSK, we have only two transmission
levels, but in the one with precoder, transmitter is assumed to
be able to diffuse at any arbitrary level (subject to the average
transmission power).

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper a new modulation technique based to accom-
modate negative signals is proposed. Also a precoder design is
presented. The proposed scheme, in conjunction with a local
chemical reaction at the receiver, is numerically shown to
have a signiﬁcant improvement in performance. The proposed
modulation and precoder scheme can be employed in other
settings, such as multi-transmitter, multi-receiver networks in
molecular communication.
