TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

1. Introduction

1.1. Background. The Seiberg-Witten (monopole) equations [SW94a, SW94b] are an im-
portant tool for understanding the topology of smooth four-dimensional manifolds. A signed
count of the solutions of these equations on a closed four-manifold yields the Seiberg-Witten
invariant [Wit94]. On a four-manifold with boundary, instead of a numerical invariant one
can deﬁne an element in a group associated to the boundary, called the Seiberg-Witten Floer
homology. There are several diﬀerent constructions of Seiberg-Witten Floer homology in
the literature, [MW01, Man03, KM07, Frø10]. The goal of this paper is to prove that, for
rational homology spheres, the deﬁnitions given by Kronheimer-Mrowka in [KM07] and by
the second author in [Man03] are equivalent.

The construction in [KM07] applies to an arbitrary three-manifold Y , equipped with a
Spinc structure s. Given this data, Kronheimer and Mrowka deﬁne an inﬁnite dimensional
analog of the Morse complex, with the underlying space being the blow-up of the conﬁgura-
tion space of Spinc connections and spinors (modulo gauge). The role of gradient ﬂow lines
is played by solutions to generic perturbations of the Seiberg-Witten equations on R × Y .
Their invariant, monopole Floer homology, is the homology of the resulting complex. This
complex (and hence also its homology) comes with a Z[U ]-module structure. The appli-
cations of monopole Floer homology include the surgery characterization of the unknot
[KMOS07] and Taubes’ proof of the Weinstein conjecture in three dimensions [Tau07].

they are denoted }HM ,(cid:100)HM , and HM . Yet another version, (cid:103)HM , was constructed by Bloom
in [Blo11]: To deﬁne (cid:103)HM , one considers the cone of the U map on the complex that deﬁnes
(cid:103)HM , and then takes homology.

In fact, there are three diﬀerent versions of monopole Floer homology deﬁned in [KM07];

Compared with [KM07], the construction in [Man03] was originally done only for rational
homology spheres; on the other hand, it yields something more than a homology group. By
using ﬁnite dimensional approximation of the Seiberg-Witten equations, combined with
Conley index theory, one obtains an invariant in the form of an equivariant suspension
spectrum. Speciﬁcally, given a rational homology sphere Y equipped with a Spinc structure
s, one can associate to it an S1-equivariant spectrum SWF(Y, s). (See also [KM02, Kha13,
Sas14] for extensions of this construction to the case b1 > 0.)

The S1-equivariant homology of SWF(Y, s) can be viewed as a deﬁnition of Seiberg-
Witten Floer homology. The advantage of having a Floer spectrum is that one can also
apply other (equivariant) generalized homology functors to it. For example, by adding the
conjugation symmetry, one can deﬁne a Pin(2)-equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homology;
this was instrumental in the disproof of the triangulation conjecture by the second author
[Man16]. For other applications of the Floer spectrum, see [Man07, Man14, Lin15, LM14].

1.2. Results. The bulk of this paper is devoted to proving:

Theorem 1.1. Let Y be a rational homology sphere with a Spinc structure s. There is an
isomorphism of absolutely-graded Z[U ]-modules:

}HM ∗(Y, s) ∼= (cid:101)H S1∗ (SWF(Y, s)),
where }HM is the “to” version of monopole Floer homology deﬁned in [KM07], and (cid:101)H S1∗
1In this paper, we grade Borel homology so that we simply have (cid:101)H S1

∗ (X) = (cid:101)H∗(X ∧S1 ES1

denotes reduced equivariant (Borel) homology.1

From Theorem 1.1 we deduce that Bloom’s homology (cid:103)HM can be identiﬁed with the
Then, (cid:103)HM ∗(Y, s) ∼= (cid:101)H∗(SWF(Y, s)) as absolutely graded abelian groups.

ordinary (non-equivariant) homology of the Floer spectrum SWF:

From the absolute grading on monopole Floer homology one can extract a Q-valued
invariant, called the Frøyshov invariant; see [Frø10] or [KM07, Section 39.1]. A similar
numerical invariant, called δ, was deﬁned in [Man16, Section 3.7] using the Floer spectrum
SWF. (The deﬁnition there was only given for Spin structures, but it extends to the Spinc
setting.) An immediate consequence of Theorem 1.1 is

Corollary 1.3. Let Y be a rational homology sphere equipped with a Spinc structure s.
Then, δ(Y, s) = −h(Y, s), where h is the Frøyshov invariant as deﬁned in [KM07, Section
39.1].

Furthermore, we can combine Theorem 1.1 with the equivalence between monopole
Floer homology and Heegaard Floer homology, established in work of Kutluhan-Lee-Taubes
[KLT10a, KLT10b, KLT10c, KLT11, KLT12] and of Colin-Ghiggini-Honda [CGH12b, CGH12c,
CGH12a] and Taubes [Tau10]. In this way we obtain a relationship between the spectrum
SWF(Y, s) and Heegaard Floer theory. Precisely, we conﬁrm a conjecture from [KM02],
that the diﬀerent ﬂavors of Heegaard Floer homology are diﬀerent equivariant homology
theories applied to SWF(Y, s):

Corollary 1.4. If Y is a rational homology sphere and s is a Spinc structure on Y , we
have the following isomorphisms of relatively graded Z[U ]-modules:

HF +∗ (Y, s) ∼= (cid:101)H S1∗ (SWF(Y, s)), (cid:100)HF ∗(Y, s) ∼= (cid:101)H∗(SWF(Y, s)),
∗ (Y, s) ∼= c(cid:101)H∗(SWF(Y, s)),
∗ (Y, s) ∼= t(cid:101)H∗(SWF(Y, s)),

where c(cid:101)H∗ and t(cid:101)H∗ denote co-Borel and Tate homology, respectively, as deﬁned in [GM95].

The results above can be applied in two directions. On the one hand, there are numer-
ous computational techniques available for Heegaard Floer homology, whereas the class of
manifolds Y for which one can compute SWF(Y, s) is rather small. By making use of the iso-
morphisms in Corollary 1.4, one can at least understand the (equivariant or non-equivariant)
homologies of SWF(Y, s). In particular:

• If (cid:100)HF ∗(Y, s) ∼= Z, this suﬃces to determine the non-equivariant stable homotopy

type of SWF(Y, s): by the Hurewicz and Whitehead theorems, it has to be that
of a (de-)suspension of the sphere spectrum. (However, it is unclear whether the
equivariant stable homotopy type of SWF(Y, s) is determined by this information.)
• In the case when s is a Spin structure, the Seiberg-Witten equations on (Y, s) have a
Pin(2) symmetry, and one can deﬁne the Pin(2)-equivariant homology of SWF(Y, s).
(This homology was used in [Man16] to disprove the triangulation conjecture in high
dimensions.) When Y is Seifert ﬁbered, the Heegaard Floer homology was calcu-
lated in [OS03], so Corollary 1.4 can tell the S1-equivariant homology of SWF(Y, s).
Together with knowledge of the monopoles (generators of the monopole Floer com-
plex) from [MOY97], this suﬃces to determine the Pin(2)-equivariant homology of
SWF(Y, s); see [Sto] for details.

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

In the reverse direction, there are certain results that are easier to prove with Floer
spectra, and one can use Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.4 to translate them into the settings of
monopole Floer or Heegaard Floer homology. This is the case with the Smith inequality for
the Floer homology of coverings, which is the subject of the sequel to this paper [LM14]. By
combining the Smith inequality with the knot surgery formula in Heegaard Floer homology
[OS11], we obtain restrictions on surgeries on a knot being regular covers over other surgeries
on that knot, and over surgeries on other knots; see [LM14].

1.3. Outline and organization of the paper. Theorem 1.1 asserts that the monopole
Floer homology of Kronheimer-Mrowka is isomorphic to the equivariant homology of the
Conley index used for SWF(Y, s). Let us describe the basic strategy for the proof. The
monopole Floer complex is deﬁned from the perturbed Seiberg-Witten equations in inﬁnite
dimensions, whereas the Conley index is a space associated to an approximation of the
Seiberg-Witten equations in ﬁnite dimensions. On the Conley index side, we can also use an
approximation of the perturbed Seiberg-Witten equations; by the continuation properties of
the Conley index, this yields a space homotopy equivalent to the one from the unperturbed
case. Thus, we start by ﬁxing a suitable perturbation, so that we have regularity in inﬁnite
dimensions, and hence we can deﬁne the monopole Floer complex. We then show that
for a large enough approximation, we also have regularity in ﬁnite dimensions, and hence
the homology of the Conley index is given by a Morse complex. Further, by applying
the inverse function theorem (for stationary points and trajectories), we conclude that the
Morse complex in ﬁnite dimensions is isomorphic to the original monopole Floer complex,
and this will complete the proof.

There are several technical diﬃculties that must be overcome to implement this strategy.
To start with, the version of Morse homology that we need to use in ﬁnite dimensions
is diﬀerent from the standard one in three ways: we are on a non-compact manifold (a
vector space), we have to deﬁne S1-equivariant rather than ordinary homology, and the
approximate Seiberg-Witten ﬂow is not a gradient ﬂow. Non-compactness is taken care of
using the notion of Conley index; this goes back to the work of Floer [Flo89]. Equivariance
was dealt with by Kronheimer and Mrowka in [KM07], using the real blow-up construction.
One intriguing aspect is that the ﬂow is not a gradient. This leads us to introduce the weaker
notion of quasi-gradient, which is a particular case of the Morse-Smale ﬂows that appear
in the study of stability for dynamical systems. We will show that one can deﬁne Morse
homology from quasi-gradients. All this is done in Section 2; there, we recall the various
notions from Morse theory and Conley index theory, the relation between the two theories,
and then proceed to deﬁne (in several steps) equivariant Morse homology for quasi-gradients
on non-compact manifolds.

In Section 3 we outline the construction of the Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum from
[Man03]. The main idea is to approximate the Seiberg-Witten equations (in global Coulomb
gauge) by a ﬂow in ﬁnite dimensions, and then to take the Conley index associated to that
ﬂow.

In Section 4 we sketch the construction of monopole Floer homology by Kronheimer
and Mrowka, following their book [KM07]. In particular, we describe the class of admis-
sible perturbations of the Seiberg-Witten equations that can be used to deﬁne the Floer
complexes.

In Section 5 we explain how the Kronheimer-Mrowka construction can be rephrased in
terms of conﬁgurations in global Coulomb gauge. This is the ﬁrst step in bringing it closer

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

to the construction of the Floer spectrum. The section is rather lengthy, because there
are several aspects of the theory that have to be translated into the new setting: gauge
conditions (in particular, for four-dimensional conﬁgurations we introduce the concept of
pseudo-temporal gauge), admissibility for perturbations, Hessians, regularity for stationary
points, spaces of paths, regularity for trajectories, gradings, orientations, and the Z[U ]-
module action.

Another step in relating the two theories is taken in Section 6. There, we show that
the Floer spectrum can be deﬁned from ﬁnite dimensional approximation of the perturbed
Seiberg-Witten equations. We use an admissible perturbation of the kind considered in
[KM07].

In Section 7 we use the inverse function theorem to identify the stationary points in
inﬁnite dimensions (i.e., the generators of the monopole Floer complex) with the stationary
points of the gradient ﬂow in the ﬁnite dimensional approximations. (This identiﬁcation
is limited to a certain grading range.) Further, we show that if the stationary points are
non-degenerate in inﬁnite dimensions, then the corresponding stationary points in suﬃ-
ciently large approximations are non-degenerate as well. Note that the approximations are
described by eigenvalue cut-oﬀs, and these range over the interval (0,∞], with ∞ giving
the original equations (in inﬁnite dimensions). When applying the inverse function theo-
rem, one thing to be careful about is how to give a manifold-with-boundary structure to
the interval (0,∞]. We do so by identifying (0,∞] with [0, 1), via a homeomorphism that
depends on the growth rate of the eigenvalues.

In Section 8 we show that the approximate Seiberg-Witten ﬂow in ﬁnite dimensions is a
quasi-gradient. The main diﬃculty there is to perturb the Chern-Simons-Dirac functional
in such a way so that it decreases along ﬂow lines.

In Section 9, we study the gradings of the stationary points in the ﬁnite dimensional
approximations and show that the correspondence with stationary points in inﬁnite dimen-
sions established in Section 7 preserves gradings.

In Section 10, we show how to arrange so that the Morse-Smale condition is satisﬁed for

the approximate ﬂow.

Section 11 contains the construction of some diﬀeomorphisms Ξλ of the conﬁguration
space. These diﬀeomorphisms take a stationary point of the approximate Seiberg-Witten
ﬂow to the corresponding stationary point of the original ﬂow. They allow us to identify the
corresponding path spaces, so that we may directly relate inﬁnite dimensional trajectories
with approximate trajectories in Sections 12 and 13.

In Section 12 we prove various convergence results for trajectories of the approximate

Seiberg-Witten ﬂow, in the limit as the eigenvalue cut-oﬀ goes to inﬁnity.

In Section 13 we use the inverse function theorem to identify the ﬂow trajectories in
inﬁnite dimensions with those in the approximations. Furthermore, we show that these
identiﬁcations preserve orientations.

Finally, in Section 14, we bring these results together to prove Theorem 1.1, about the
equivalence between monopole Floer homology and the equivariant homology of SWF(Y, s).
We also prove the three corollaries stated in Section 1.2.

1.4. Conventions. Throughout the paper, when we talk about the ﬂow associated to a
vector ﬁeld v, we mean the reverse ﬂow generated by v, i.e, the ﬂow whose trajectories
satisfy:

d
dt

γ(t) + v(γ(t)) = 0.

8

Also, we depart from the terminology in [KM07], where critical points of the CSD func-
tional are also referred to as critical points of the Seiberg-Witten vector ﬁeld. Here, we
sometimes need to think of vector ﬁelds as maps to the tangent space, and the critical
points of a map are the zeros of its derivative. To prevent confusion, we will use the term
stationary point to refer to the zero of a vector ﬁeld.

2. Morse homology in finite dimensions

In this section we describe several versions of Morse homology (all in ﬁnite dimensions),

building up to the construction that will be needed in the paper.

x and the stable manifold W s

2.1. The standard construction. Let X be a closed, oriented Riemannian manifold
equipped with a Morse function f . The Morse-Smale condition requires that for any two
critical points x and y, the unstable manifold W u
y intersect
transversely. Their intersection is then a smooth manifold M (x, y), the moduli space of
parameterized ﬂows between x and y, which has dimension ind(x) − ind(y).
With this information, we can build the Morse complex [Wit82, Bot88, Flo89]. The chain
groups in degree i, denoted Ci, are freely generated over Z by the critical points of f of
index i. We deﬁne the diﬀerential ∂ as follows. If x and y are critical points of index i
and i − 1 respectively, then ˘M (x, y) := M (x, y)/R is a compact, oriented 0-manifold. (See
Section 2.2 below for the construction of orientations.) We let n(x, y) denote the number
of unparameterized ﬂow lines of ∇f from x to y, counted with sign. The Morse diﬀerential
is

(1)

∂x =

(cid:88)

n(x, y) · y.

{y|ind(y)=ind(x)−1}

It turns out that ∂2 = 0 and one can take the homology of this complex. The Morse
homology is isomorphic to the singular homology, H∗(X).
For future reference, we mention a (well-known) alternative way of expressing the Morse-
Smale condition. Let f : M → R be Morse, and x, y be two critical points. Deﬁne P(x, y)
to be the space of smooth paths γ : R → M with limt→−∞ γ(t) = x and limt→+∞ γ(t) = y.
The space P(x, y) has a well-deﬁned L2
k completion Pk(x, y), which is a Banach manifold.
(See, for example, [Sch93, Section 2.1] for the case k = 1.) For 0 ≤ j ≤ k, we let Tj,γP(x, y)
j completion of the tangent space to Pk(x, y) at γ. (If we ﬁx j, these spaces are
be the L2
naturally identiﬁed for all k ≥ j, so we do not include k in the notation.) The moduli space
M (x, y) is the zero set of the section

F : Pk(x, y) → Tk−1P(x, y), γ (cid:55)→ dγ
dt
Given a path γ ∈ Pk(x, y), we get the linearized operator

+ (∇f )(γ).

Lγ = (dF )γ : Tj,γP(x, y) → Tj−1,γP(x, y),

(2)
for all j with 1 ≤ j ≤ k.

The deﬁnition of Lγ involves taking derivatives of vector ﬁelds, i.e., covariant derivatives.
To do this, we need to choose a connection on T M in a neighborhood U of the image of
γ. This can be the Levi-Civita connection coming from the Riemannian metric or, as in
[AD14], the trivial connection induced from a trivialization of T M over U . In either case,
if we denote by D the covariant derivative, and w ∈ Tj,γP(x, y) is a vector ﬁeld along γ, we
have

(3)
Note that if D is the Levi-Civita connection, then the second term D(∇f )(w) is the Hessian
of f applied to w at γ(t).
One can check that Lγ is a Fredholm operator. When γ ∈ M (x, y), the index of Lγ is

Lγ(w) =

+ D(∇f )(w).

Lemma 2.1. Suppose k ≥ 2 and 1 ≤ j ≤ k. Let D and D(cid:48) be two connections on T M in
an open set U containing the image of γ ∈ Pk(x, y). Write Lγ and L(cid:48)
γ for the operators (2)
that correspond to D, resp. D(cid:48). Then:

Proof. Let A = D − D(cid:48) ∈ Ω1(U ; End(T M )). Then

γ) : Tj,γP(x, y) → Tj,γP(x, y)

converge to Lγ − L(cid:48)
γ in operator norm. Furthermore, when precomposing these truncations
with the inclusion of Tj,γP(x, y) into Tj−1,γP(x, y), we obtain compact operators. (Indeed,
we can apply Rellich’s lemma, because we restrict attention to a ﬁxed compact interval.)
Since the limit of compact operators is compact, we conclude that Lγ − L(cid:48)
γ, as an operator
from Tj,γP(x, y) to Tj−1,γP(x, y), is compact.
(cid:3)
Lemma 2.2. Fix j ≥ 1. Then, the function f is Morse-Smale if and only if for any two
critical points x and y of f , and for any gradient trajectory γ ∈ M (x, y), the operator Lγ
from (2) is surjective.

Part (ii) follows immediately from (4).

γ) with the orthogonal complement (Tγ(t)W u

Proof. See [AD14, Theorem 10.1.5] for the case j = 1. The main idea is that surjectivity of
γ and, for any t ∈ R, one can identify
Lγ is equivalent to injectivity of the formal adjoint L∗
y )⊥. Thus, W u
ker(L∗
y are
transverse at γ(t) if and only if L∗
γ : Tj,γP(x, y) → Tj−1,γP(x, y)
consists of smooth conﬁgurations (as can be seen by a standard bootstrapping argument),
(cid:3)
and hence the kernel is independent of j.

x + Tγ(t)W s
The same proof works for any j ≥ 1. In fact, the kernel of L∗

γ is injective.

x and W s

2.2. Orientations. We now discuss the construction of orientations in Morse homology.
The traditional way is to choose orientations for W u
x for all critical points x. These induce
x , and hence on the moduli spaces M (x, y). When ind(x) − ind(y) = 1, a
orientations on W s
trajectory u ∈ M (x, y) is counted in the diﬀerential ∂ with a sign ±1 depending on whether
the orientation of M (x, y) at u coincides with the canonical orientation of R.

An alternative way of constructing orientations, closer to Floer theory, is described in
[Sch93, Chapter 3]. Let us sketch this construction here. First, note that to every Fredholm
operator L we can associate a one-dimensional vector space, the determinant line

det(L) = Λmax(ker L) ⊗ Λmax(coker L)∗.

From the proof of Lemma 2.2 we see that the tangent bundle to M (x, y) can be identiﬁed
with the kernel of the operator Lγ from (3), whereas the cokernel of Lγ is trivial. Thus,
orienting M (x, y) is equivalent to orienting the determinant line bundle det(L) → M (x, y),
with ﬁbers det(Lγ) over γ ∈ M (x, y).

Following [Sch93, Deﬁnition 2.1], let us equip R = R ∪ {±∞} with the structure of a
smooth manifold with boundary by requiring that the map R → [−1, 1], t (cid:55)→ t/
1 + t2 is a
diﬀeomorphism. For every x, y ∈ X (not necessarily critical points), we consider the space
of smooth curves

√

x,y = {γ ∈ C∞(R, X) | γ(−∞) = x, γ(+∞) = y}.
C∞

For γ ∈ C∞

x,y, we let Σγ∗T X be the space of Fredholm operators of the form

D
dt

+ A(t) : T1,γP(x, y) → T0,γP(x, y),

K =

(5)
where A ∈ C0(R; End(γ∗T X)) is a path of endomorphisms such that K± := A(±∞) is non-
degenerate and conjugated self-adjoint2. In particular, when x and y are critical points, the
operator Lγ from (3) is of this form.
Consider the set of pairs (γ, K), where γ ∈ C∞(R, X) and K ∈ Σγ∗T X . Following [Sch93,
Deﬁnition 3.7], two such pairs (γ, K) and (ζ, L) are said to be equivalent if we have the
asymptotical identities

γ(±∞) = ζ(±∞) and K± = L±.

Let E be the set of such equivalence classes. Thus, an element of E is determined by two
points x, y ∈ X, together with two non-degenerate and conjugated self-adjoint operators
K− ∈ End(TxX) and K+ ∈ End(TyY ).

It is proved in [Sch93, Section 3.2.1] that, if (γ, K) is equivalent to (ζ, L), there is a natural
identiﬁcation of the determinant lines det(K) and det(L). Hence, we can write det([γ, K])
for a class [γ, K] ∈ E. As in [Sch93, Deﬁnition 3.15], we deﬁne a coherent orientation to be
a map σ that associates an orientation of det([γ, K]) to any [γ, K] ∈ E, in a way compatible
with concatenation of paths and operators; that is,

σ[γ, K]#σ[ζ, L] = σ[γ#ζ, K#L],

(6)
whenever γ(+∞) = ζ(−∞) and K+ = L−. We denote by # the natural concatenation
operator.
Proposition 3.16 in [Sch93] shows that coherent orientations exist. Concretely, a coherent
orientation can be speciﬁed by choosing a basepoint x0 ∈ X, some non-degenerate and
conjugated self-adjoint operator A ∈ End(Tx0X), choosing the trivial orientation for the
class [x0, K0], where x0 is the constant path at x0 and K0 = d
dt + A, and ﬁnally choosing
arbitrary orientations σ[γ, K] for all classes [γ, K] ∈ E with [γ, K] (cid:54)= [x0, K0] and γ(−∞) =
x0. Once this set of data is ﬁxed, the orientations for the other classes in E are determined
by the gluing condition (6).
In particular, a coherent orientation gives orientations of the determinant line bundles
det(L) → M (x, y), and hence of the moduli spaces M (x, y) themselves. These orientations
can be used to deﬁne the Morse diﬀerential as in (1). Furthermore, it is proved in [Sch93,
Appendix B] that the coherent orientation can be chosen so that the orientations on M (x, y)
coincide with those coming from orienting the unstable manifolds. Therefore, the resulting
Morse complex is the same as in the classical deﬁnition.

We now introduce a third way of deﬁning orientations for the Morse complex. This is
a variant of Schwarz’s construction, but closer to what Kronheimer and Mrowka do for
2In [Sch93], for a real vector space V , an operator A ∈ End(V ) is called conjugated self-adjoint if it is
self-adjoint with respect to some scalar product. This condition is equivalent to A being diagonalizable over
R.

operators of the form D
and γ ∈ P(x, y) arbitrary. However, note that Lγ is only Fredholm when the Hessian

between the diﬀerent sets Λγ(x, y). Consequently, we can drop γ from the notation and
write Λ(x, y) for any Λγ(x, y).

By considering concatenation of paths, we obtain a natural composition map

Λ(x, y), one for each x, y ∈ X, such that

Λ(x, y) × Λ(y, z) → Λ(x, z).

for all x, y, z ∈ X, where the multiplication is with respect to (8).

A specialized coherent orientation can be constructed as follows. We choose a critical
point x0 of f , and consider the operator ˜Lx0 for the constant path at x0. There is a canonical
∼= {±1} we can choose the element +1.
identiﬁcation det( ˜Lx0) ∼= R, and hence from ox0,x0
Then, we choose arbitrary elements of ox0,x for all other x ∈ X, and we obtain elements in
any ox,y using the concatenation rule.

Using the identiﬁcation between det( ˜Lγ) and det( ˜Lext

γ ), we see that a coherent orienta-
tion gives rise to a specialized coherent orientation. Conversely, any specialized coherent
orientation can be extended to a coherent orientation. To check this last statement, consider
the construction of a specialized coherent orientation from the choices of x0 and elements in
ox0,x, as above. This is a subset of the data needed to give a coherent orientation. Indeed,
letting K0 = d
dt + Hess(f )x0, we see that from the elements of ox0,x we get orientations
σ[γ, K] for paths γ starting at x0 and ending at x, and for K with K+ = H +
x . Let us now
also choose orientations σ[γ, K] for γ ∈ Pk(x0, x) but K+ (cid:54)= H +
x . This gives the necessary
data to construct a coherent orientation.
Finally, note that a specialized coherent orientation gives rise to orientations on the
moduli spaces M (x, y) in the following way. Given γ ∈ M (x, y), pick I = [t1, t2] ⊂ R large
enough so that the operators Hess(f )γ(t) are non-degenerate for all t ∈ (−∞, t1] ∪ [t2,∞).
Consider the restriction of γ to the interval I, and the corresponding operator ˜Lγ|I . The
orientation on det( ˜Lγ|I ) gives an orientation on det(Lγ), by a concatenation process similar
to the one in [KM07, Section 20.4]. In turn, this orients the tangent space TγM (x, y).

We conclude that a specialized coherent orientation o can be used to give signs in the
Morse complex. When o is induced by a coherent orientation σ, the signs coming from o are
the same as those coming from σ. Thus, the three ways of producing orientations, which
we have described in this section, all produce the same Morse complex.

2.3. Quasi-gradient vector ﬁelds. The purpose of this subsection is to extend Morse-
Smale theory to a class of vector ﬁelds that are not gradients. Note that among all smooth
vector ﬁelds on a manifold, gradient vector ﬁelds are rather special—even when allowing
both the metric and the function to vary. For example, the diﬀerential of a gradient vector
ﬁeld at a critical point has only real eigenvalues (because it is a symmetric operator with
respect to the given metric). This is also true for the gradient-like (also called pseudo-
gradient) vector ﬁelds that are sometimes used in Morse theory, e.g., in [Mil65, AD14]. We
want to relax this condition, and allow for the stationary points of our vector ﬁeld to only
be hyperbolic, in the following sense:

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let v be a smooth vector ﬁeld on a manifold X. A stationary point x of
v is called hyperbolic if (the complexiﬁcation of ) the derivative (dv)x : TxX → TxX has no
purely imaginary eigenvalues.

We now introduce the class of vector ﬁelds we want to work with.

Deﬁnition 2.5. Let X be a smooth manifold. A smooth vector ﬁeld v on X is called Morse
quasi-gradient if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(a) All stationary points of v are hyperbolic.
(b) There exists a smooth function f : X → R such that df (v) ≥ 0 at all x ∈ X, with

equality holding if and only if x is a stationary point of v.

14

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

Example 2.6. The gradient vector ﬁeld of a Morse function f has hyperbolic stationary
points, since the eigenvalues of (dv)x are real and non-zero; further, the Morse function f
can be used in condition (b).

For future reference, it is worth pointing out the following.

Lemma 2.7. Let v be a Morse quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld on a smooth manifold X, and let
f be a function as in part (b) of Deﬁnition 2.5. Then, any stationary point of v is a critical
point of f .

Proof. Let x be a stationary point of v. Since x is a minimum of the function df (v), we
have d(df (v))x = 0. For y ∈ TxX, we get

0 = d(df (v))x(y) = (d2f )x(vx, y) + (df )x((dv)x(y)).

The ﬁrst term in the last expression is zero, because vx = 0. Further, since x is hyperbolic,
we have that (dv)x is an automorphism of TxX, hence (dv)x(y) = z can take any value in
TxX. We conclude that (df )x(z) = 0 for all z ∈ TxX, so x is a critical point of f .
(cid:3)

For the rest of this subsection we will assume that X is closed and oriented. Let v be a
Morse quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld on X. We seek to establish several properties that v has
in common with gradients of Morse functions.
Let C be the set of stationary points of v. If x ∈ C, hyperbolicity implies that we have a

decomposition

The local structure of ﬂows near hyperbolic singularities is well-understood; a good refer-
ence is [PdM82, Chapter 2]. Theorem 4.10 in [PdM82] says that around every x ∈ C there
is a local coordinate chart Nx such that the restriction of v to Nx is conjugate to a linear
ﬂow (under a homeomorphism). This implies that x is the only stationary point inside Nx.
Since X is compact, we deduce that the set C is ﬁnite.
We can arrange so that the neighborhoods Nx are disjoint for diﬀerent x. By part (b) of

x X have positive real part.

x X have

Next, consider the ﬂow on X associated to v. Let γ : R → X be a ﬂow line, i.e.,

dγ/dt + v(γ(t)) = 0. We have:

(10)

f (γ(t)) = −dfγ(t) ◦ v(γ(t)) ≤ 0,

d
dt

with equality only if γ(t) is stationary. Therefore, f decreases (strictly) along non-stationary
ﬂow lines.

Lemma 2.8. Let v be a Morse quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld on a closed, oriented, smooth
manifold X. Let γ : R → X be a ﬂow line of v. Then, limt→−∞ γ(t) and limt→+∞ γ(t)
exist, and they are both stationary points of v.

Proof. This is similar to the Morse gradient case; cf. [BH04, Proposition 3.19]. Let Nx be
the neighborhoods of x ∈ C constructed above, and  > 0 be such that (9) holds.
Compactness of X implies that γ(t) is deﬁned for all t ∈ R, and f ◦γ : R → R is bounded.

(Here, f is the function in part (b) of Deﬁnition 2.5.) From Equation (10) we see that

t→±∞−df (v)(γ(t)) = lim
t→±∞

f (γ(t)) = 0.

In view of (9), this shows that for t (cid:28) 0, the ﬂow line γ(t) is contained in the chart
Nx for some x. Further, if tn → −∞, then at any accumulation point of the sequence
{γ(tn)} ⊆ X we must have df (v) = 0. Hence, the only accumulation point (which exists by
the compactness of X) must be the stationary point x. We deduce that limt→−∞ γ(t) = x.
A similar argument applies to γ(t) as t → +∞.
(cid:3)

Hyperbolicity of stationary points implies the existence of stable and unstable manifolds

If we did not have condition (b) in Deﬁnition 2.5, the maps Es and Eu may not be embed-
dings, and W s
x may not be manifolds. (See [PdM82, p.74] for an example.) However,
for Morse quasi-gradients, Es and Eu are homeomorphisms onto their images, and hence
embeddings. The proof of this fact can be taken verbatim from the Morse gradient case;
cf. Lemma 4.10 in [BH04]. Indeed, the main input in that proof is the existence of limits
of ﬂow lines at ±∞; this was established for quasi-gradients in Lemma 2.8.
x ⊆ M , of
Thus, for every x ∈ C, we have stable and unstable submanifolds W s
dimensions dim(X) − ind(x) and ind(x), respectively. We can then formulate the Morse-
Smale condition as in the gradient case:

Deﬁnition 2.9. A Morse quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld v is called Morse-Smale if for all
stationary points x and y, the unstable manifold W u

Morse-Smale quasi-gradients are a particular example of the Morse-Smale vector ﬁelds,
which play an important role in the theory of dynamical systems. We recall their deﬁnition
below. See [PdM82, Chapter 5] for an introduction to the subject.

Deﬁnition 2.10 ([PdM82], p.118-119). Let X be a closed, smooth manifold. A smooth
vector ﬁeld v on X is called Morse-Smale if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) v has a ﬁnite number of critical elements (stationary points and closed orbits), all of

which are hyperbolic.3

(b) If σ1 and σ2 are critical elements of v, then the unstable manifold of σ1 is transverse

to the stable manifold of σ2;

(c) The set of nonwandering points for v is equal to the union of the critical elements of v.
Here, x ∈ X is called a wandering point for v if there exists a neighborhood U of x and a
number t0 > 0 such that Φt(U ) ∩ U = ∅ for |t| > t0, where {Φt}t∈R is the ﬂow generated by
v. Otherwise, we say that x is nonwandering.

3See [PdM82, p.95] for the deﬁnition of hyperbolicity for closed orbits. Stable and unstable manifolds for

closed orbits are deﬁned in the obvious way; see [PdM82, p.98].

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

Morse-Smale vector ﬁelds satisfy structural stability, that is, a small perturbation of a
Morse-Smale dynamical system is conjugate to the original system via a homeomorphism.

Lemma 2.11. A Morse-Smale quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld, in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.9,
is a Morse-Smale vector ﬁeld in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.10 and, furthermore, it has no
closed orbits.

Proof. Closed orbits do not exist because f decreases along ﬂow lines. Parts (a) and (b)
of Deﬁnition 2.10 are immediate consequences of Deﬁnition 2.9. Part (c), the fact that
(cid:3)
nonstationary points are wandering, follows since f decreases along ﬂow lines.

Suppose v is a Morse-Smale quasi-gradient ﬁeld. For every x, y ∈ C, the intersection

M (x, y) := W u

x ∩ W s

y

is transverse, and hence a manifold of dimension ind(x)− ind(y). We can construct a Morse
complex (C∗, ∂) as in the gradient case. The groups C∗ are generated by the stationary
points, the grading is determined by the index, and the diﬀerential ∂ is given by the formula
(1).

Proposition 2.12. Let v be a Morse-Smale quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld on a closed, oriented,
smooth manifold X. Let (C∗, ∂) be the corresponding Morse complex. Then ∂2 = 0, and
the homology H∗(C) is isomorphic to H∗(M ).

Proof. In the gradient case, one way to prove that Morse homology recovers singular ho-
mology is by using the Conley index; cf. [Flo89, Sal90, Fra86, McC88] or [BH04, Chapter
7]. (See Section 2.4 below for the deﬁnition of the Conley index.) The basic idea is to ﬁnd
a Morse decomposition of the ﬂow into attractor-repeller pairs. This produces a ﬁltration
of X by index pairs, such that the quotients are the Conley indices of the stationary points
x ∈ C. These quotients are homotopy equivalent to spheres of dimensions ind(x), and the
connecting homomorphisms between their homology groups are given by the signed count
of ﬂow lines.

This proof can be adapted to the setting of Morse-Smale quasi-gradients. Indeed, one
can construct Morse decompositions and connection matrices for general ﬂows, as in the
work of Franzosa [Fra86]. Further, Theorem 3.1 in [McC88] describes the neighborhood of
a ﬂow line between two hyperbolic points in a Morse-Smale (not necessarily gradient) ﬂow.
This shows that the connection matrices are given by counts of ﬂow lines, i.e. that each
gradient ﬂow line contributes plus or minus 1 to the boundary operator. Orientations can
(cid:3)
be ﬁxed as in [Flo89, Sal90].

The rest of the discussion in Section 2.1 extends to quasi-gradients as well. The Morse-

Smale condition can be phrased in terms of the surjectivity of the operator

Lγ(w) =

Dw
dt

+ D(v)(w),

as in Lemma 2.2. Furthermore, the discussion from Section 2.2 carries over to this setting,
so the moduli spaces M (x, y) can be oriented using coherent orientations or specialized
coherent orientations. The only caveat is that in the deﬁnition of coherent orientations,
when we deﬁne the sets Σγ∗T X , we should allow the operators K± to be hyperbolic, rather
than conjugated self-adjoint.

2.4. Morse homology for isolated invariant sets. Suppose X is a (possibly non-
compact) smooth, oriented manifold equipped with a Morse quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld v.
In general, there is no way of deﬁning a Morse complex. Even if we assume the Morse-Smale
condition on the unstable and stable manifolds, the resulting diﬀerential may not square to
zero, because ﬂow lines can escape to inﬁnity.

Nevertheless, we have a Morse complex in a certain setting, described below. First, we
recall the deﬁnitions of an isolated invariant set, index pair, and Conley index, following
[Con78]. Fix a one-parameter subgroup {Φt} of diﬀeomorphisms of a manifold X. Given a
compact subset A ⊆ X, deﬁne the compact subset

Inv(A, Φ) = {x ∈ A | Φt(x) ∈ A for all t ∈ R}.

Deﬁnition 2.13. A compact set S ⊆ X is called an isolated invariant set if there exists
a compact A ⊆ X with S = Inv(A, Φ) ⊆ int(A). Such a set A is called an isolating
neighborhood for S .
Deﬁnition 2.14. An index pair (N, L) for S is a pair of compact sets L ⊆ N ⊆ X if
a) Inv(N − L, Φ) = S ⊂ int(N − L),
b) for all x ∈ N , if there exists t > 0 such that Φt(x) is not in N , there exists 0 ≤ τ < t
with Φτ (x) ∈ L (L is an exit set for N ),
c) given x ∈ L, t > 0, if Φs(x) ⊆ N for all 0 ≤ s ≤ t, then Φs(x) is in L for 0 ≤ s ≤ t (L
is positively invariant in N ).

Conley [Con78] showed that any isolated invariant set S admits an index pair. The
Conley index for an isolated invariant set S , denoted I(Φ, S ), is deﬁned to be the pointed
space (N/L, [L]). Its pointed homotopy type is an invariant of the triple (X, Φt, S ). In
fact, the Conley index is invariant under continuous deformations of the ﬂow, as long as S
remains isolated in a suitable sense.
Going back to the case of a Morse-Smale quasi-gradient ﬂow on X, suppose S ⊆ X is
an isolated invariant set. Let C[S ] be the set of stationary points of v that lie in S . The
set C[S ] is ﬁnite, because S is compact. For any x, y ∈ C[S ], if a point of S is on a ﬂow
line γ ∈ ˘M (x, y), then all the points on that ﬂow line must be in S . Further, the subsets

are both open and closed in ˘M (x, y). We have

˘M [S ](x, y) = {γ ∈ ˘M (x, y) | γ ⊂ S }

(cid:91)

S =

γ.

x,y∈C[S ]

γ∈ ˘M [S ](x,y)

We can deﬁne a Morse complex C[S ] to be freely generated by the points in C[S ], with
the diﬀerential given by counting only the ﬂow lines in ˘M [S ](x, y). We still have ∂2 = 0,
and we obtain a Morse homology H∗(C[S ]).

The following theorem was proved by Floer in [Flo89] in the setting of Morse-Smale
gradient ﬂows. The extension to the quasi-gradient case goes along the same lines as the
proof of Proposition 2.12. (In fact, the results of Franzosa and McCord used in that proof
were originally phrased for more general ﬂows.)
Theorem 2.15 (cf. [Flo89]). Given an isolated invariant set S in a Morse-Smale quasi-
gradient ﬂow φ on a manifold X, the Morse homology H∗(C[S ]) is isomorphic to the
reduced homology of the Conley index of S .

18

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

Thus, if (N, L) is an index pair for S and L ⊆ N is a neighborhood deformation retract
(which can easily be arranged), then the Morse homology is isomorphic to the relative
homology H∗(N, L).

2.5. Morse homology for manifolds with boundary. Let X be a smooth, oriented,
compact manifold with boundary. We proceed to describe the construction of a Morse
complex, ( ˇC(X), ˇ∂), whose homology is isomorphic to H∗(X; Z) (we will ignore the analo-
gous constructions for H∗(∂M ; Z) or H∗(X, ∂X; Z)). For gradient ﬂows, this construction
appeared in print in [KM07, Section 2.4], although it may have been known before. See
also [Lau11], [BNR12] for related work. Our exposition follows [KM07] closely, except we
use the more general quasi-gradient ﬂows.

Fix a metric g and a Morse quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld v on X such that g and v are
respectively the restrictions of a metric and a vector ﬁeld on the double of X, which are
invariant under the obvious involution. Among the stationary points of v, there are those
which occur in the interior of X; their set is denoted Co. The others are stationary points
If x ∈ ∂X is such a point, note that the normal vector to the boundary Nx is
on ∂X.
taken to its opposite under the involution, and the same holds for dv(Nx). Hence, Nx is
an eigenvector of dv, so it must live in either T s
x X. In the ﬁrst case we say that
x is boundary-stable, and in the second that it is boundary-unstable. The set of boundary-
stable stationary points is denoted Cs, and the set of boundary-unstable stationary points
is denoted Cu.

x X or T u

We require that v satisfy the usual Morse-Smale condition, except in the so-called boundary-

x and W s

obstructed case, when x is boundary-stable and y is boundary-unstable. In the boundary-
obstructed case, W u
y are subsets of ∂X, so transversality in X is impossible. There-
fore, we instead require that they intersect transversely in ∂X. When this happens, the
dimension of M (x, y) is in fact ind(x) − ind(y) + 1.
For any x, y ∈ C = Co ∪ Cs ∪ Cu, we let M ∂(x, y) = M (x, y) ∩ ∂X and ˘M ∂(x, y) =
M ∂(x, y)/R. One can induce the same orientations on the moduli spaces as in the usual
closed setting, except in the boundary-obstructed case, where we must also make use of an
outward normal vector.
We let Co, Cs, and Cu be the free Abelian groups generated by Co, Cs, and Cu respectively.
The chain groups we work with will be ˇC(X) = Co ⊕ Cs. Although these chain groups do
not incorporate the boundary-unstable stationary points, the diﬀerential does. The way
that the ﬂows are counted varies from the usual construction. We deﬁne two sets of maps

for various pairs of θ,  ∈ {o, u, s}. If (θ, ) ∈ {(o, o), (o, s), (u, o), (u, s)} and x ∈ Cθ, deﬁne

2.6. Morse homology for manifolds with circle actions. A circle action is called
semifree if it is free on the complement of the ﬁxed points. For manifolds with semifree S1-
actions, Kronheimer and Mrowka showed that the methods in the previous subsection can
be applied to obtain Morse theoretic approximations to the S1-equivariant homology. We
sketch their arguments here, following [KM07, Sections 2.5–2.6], but phrasing everything in
terms of quasi-gradients rather than gradients.

Suppose that a closed Riemannian manifold X has a smooth, semifree S1-action by
isometries, and let Q denote the ﬁxed point set. Let N (Q) be the normal bundle of Q, and
N 1(Q) the unit normal bundle. Observe that the S1-action gives N (Q) the structure of a
complex vector bundle. In order to make X/S1 into a manifold, we resolve the singularity
at Q by considering the blow-up

X σ = (X − Q) ∪(cid:0)N 1(Q) × [0, )(cid:1),

where we have identiﬁed N 1(Q)× (0, ) with N (Q)− Q ⊂ X. Note that X σ/S1 is a smooth
manifold with boundary N 1(Q)/S1.
A smooth, S1-invariant vector ﬁeld ˜v on X induces a vector ﬁeld v on (X − Q)/S1. In
[KM07, Lemma

turn, this extends naturally to a smooth vector ﬁeld vσ on X σ/S1; cf.
2.5.2]. Note that ˜v must be tangent to Q, and hence vσ is tangent to the boundary.
Precisely, the dynamics of vσ on the boundary N 1(Q)/S1 = ∂(X σ/S1) can be described
as follows. A point on the boundary can be written as (q, [φ]) with q ∈ Q and φ ∈ N 1
q (Q).
As discussed, Nq(Q) has a complex structure; we let (cid:104)φ(cid:105)⊥ be the complex orthogonal com-
plement to φ in Nq(Q). Decompose the tangent space to X σ/S1 at q as

The covariant derivative (∇˜v)q : TqX → TqX is S1-equivariant, and hence takes the

TqQ ⊕ (cid:104)φ(cid:105)⊥ ⊕ R,

(12)
where R is the direction normal to the boundary.
normal direction NqQ ⊂ TqX to NqQ. Let
(13)

Lq := (∇˜v)|NqQ.
With respect to the decomposition (12), let us write

vσ(q, [φ]) = (˜v(q), Lqφ, 0).

Here, when ˜v(q) = 0, the second term equals

Lqφ = Lqφ − Re(cid:104)φ, Lqφ(cid:105)φ.

Thus, the stationary points of vσ on the boundary are the pairs (q, [φ]), where q is a zero

of ˜v|Q and φ is an eigenvector of Lq.

20

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

Furthermore, the ﬂow associated to vσ on the boundary is given by the equations:

(14)

q∗(∇) +(cid:0)Lq(t) − Re(cid:104)φ(t), Lq(t)φ(t)(cid:105)φ(t)(cid:1)dt = 0,

+ ˜v(q(t)) = 0,

dq
dt

(15)
where |φ(t)| = 1 for all t.
Deﬁnition 2.18. A smooth, S1-invariant vector ﬁeld ˜v on X is called a Morse equivariant
quasi-gradient if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) All stationary points of v on (X − Q)/S1 are hyperbolic.
(b) All stationary points of ˜v|Q are hyperbolic.
(c) At each stationary point q of ˜v|Q, the operator Lq : NqQ → NqQ is self-adjoint, and
admits a basis of eigenvectors φ1(q), φ2(q), . . . , φn(q) with corresponding eigenvalues
λ1(q), λ2(q), . . . , λn(q) such that

λ1(q) < λ2(q) < ··· < λn(q)

(d) There exists a smooth, S1-equivariant function ˜f : X → R such that d ˜f (˜v) ≥ 0 at all

and λi(q) (cid:54)= 0 for any i.
x ∈ X, with equality holding if and only if ˜v(x) = 0.

Lemma 2.19. Parts (a), (b) and (c) in Deﬁnition 2.18, taken together, are equivalent to
asking for all the stationary points of vσ on X σ/S1 to be hyperbolic, and for those on the
boundary to give rise to operators Lq that are self-adjoint.

Furthermore, if ˜v is as in Deﬁnition 2.18, and (q, [φi(q)]) is a stationary point of vσ on

the boundary, then its index is given by

(cid:40)

ind(q, [φi(q)]) =

indQ(q) + 2i − 2
indQ(q) + 2i − 1

if λi(q) > 0,
if λi(q) < 0.

Proof. Away from the boundary, a stationary point of vσ is just a stationary point of v, and
the two notions of hyperbolicity (and index) correspond. With regard to stationary points
on the boundary and their indices, see [KM07, Proof of Lemma 2.5.5] for the case of gradient
(cid:3)
ﬁelds. The arguments there extend to the quasi-gradient setting without diﬃculty.

Remark 2.20. In part (c) of Deﬁnition 2.18, the condition that Lq is self-adjoint (and has real
eigenvalues) is not strictly necessary. We could have only asked for Lq to have a complex ba-
sis of eigenvectors φ1(q), φ2(q), . . . , φn(q) with corresponding eigenvalues λ1(q), λ2(q), . . . , λn(q)
such that

Re λ1(q) < Re λ2(q) < ··· < Re λn(q)

and Re λi(q) (cid:54)= 0 for any i. With this weaker requirement, the results of this section would
still hold, but the proof of Lemma 2.23 below would be more complicated. In the case of
interest to us in this paper, the Lq are self-adjoint, so we decided to include this condition
in the deﬁnition.

Lemma 2.21. Let ˜v be a Morse equivariant quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld, and let f be a
function as in part (d) of Deﬁnition 2.18. Then, any stationary point of ˜v is a critical point
of f .

Proof. This is similar to the proof of Lemma 2.7.

(cid:3)

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

21

Given x ∈ X, we write [x] for its S1-equivalence class, i.e. its projection to the singular

space X/S1.

Lemma 2.22. Let ˜v be a Morse equivariant quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld on X, as in Deﬁni-
tion 2.18. Let γ : R → X be a ﬂow line of ˜v. Then, limt→−∞[γ(t)] and limt→+∞[γ(t)] exist
in X/S1, and they are both projections of stationary points of ˜v.

Proof. This is similar to the proof of Lemma 2.8.

(cid:3)

Suppose ˜v is a Morse equivariant quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld on X, with ˜f as in part (d)
of Deﬁnition 2.18. Observe that ˜f induces a function f : X/S1 → R which is smooth except
on Q/S1. Using f we see that vσ is a Morse quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld on the interior of
X σ/S1.
If we let f σ : X σ/S1 → R be the composition of the blow-down map with f , then f σ is

smooth, and we have

df σ(vσ) ≥ 0.
(16)
However, ˜f is constant on the ﬁbers N 1
q (Q)/S1. Hence, equality happens in (16) not only
at the stationary points of vσ, but also at all (q, [φ]) ∈ ∂(X σ/S1) such that ˜v(q) = 0 (and φ
does not have to be an eigenvector). Therefore, vσ is not naturally a Morse quasi-gradient
on all of X σ/S1; or, at least, we cannot use f σ to argue that it is.

Nevertheless, we will still be able to do Morse homology using the ﬂow of vσ. To start
with, observe that there are no closed orbits in this ﬂow: In view of (16), the only such
orbits would have to be contained in a ﬁber N 1
q (Q)/S1, where ˜v(q) = 0. From (15) we see
that the ﬂow on the projective space N 1
q (Q)/S1 is the projection of a linear ﬂow on NqQ,
which is in fact a gradient ﬂow. This shows that there are no closed orbits in that ﬁber.

Furthermore, we have the analogue of Lemmas 2.8 and 2.22:

Lemma 2.23. Let ˜v be a Morse equivariant quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld on X, as in Deﬁni-
tion 2.18. Let γ : R → X σ/S1 be a ﬂow line of vσ. Then, limt→−∞ γ(t) and limt→+∞ γ(t)
exist in X σ/S1, and they are both stationary points of vσ.

Proof. By Lemma 2.22, we already know that the projection of γ to the blow-down X/S1
limits to two stationary points. The projection is one-to-one away from the boundary, so
it suﬃces to study the case of a trajectory that (in the blow-down) limits to a stationary
point q0 in the ﬁxed point set Q. The limit can be at either −∞ and +∞. Without loss of
generality, we consider the case of +∞, and focus on the half-trajectory

γ+ : [0,∞) → X σ/S1, γ+(t) = γ(t).

The idea is that, in the blow-up, the ﬂow of vσ near the boundary N 1(Q)/S1 is approx-
imated by the ﬂow on the boundary, which is given by (14)-(15), and whose behavior we
understand.
A suitably small neighborhood V ⊂ X σ/S1 of the boundary ∂(X σ/S1) = N 1(Q)/S1 can
be identiﬁed with the normal bundle to the boundary. Hence, a point v ∈ V can be written
q (Q), normalized so that |φ| = 1. (Here,
as a triple (q, s, [φ]), with q ∈ Q, s ≥ 0, and φ ∈ N 1
s represents the distance to the boundary.) With Lq as in (13), we introduce the functional

Λ : V → R, Λ(q, s, [φ]) = (cid:104)φ, Lqφ(cid:105).

The stationary points of vσ on the boundary correspond to s = 0 and dΛ = 0.

q0(Q)/S1 over q0. The restriction of vσ to F is the gradient of
Consider the ﬁber F = N 1
2 Λ|F . By part (c) of Deﬁnition 2.18, vσ|F has n stationary points, corresponding to the
eigenvalues λi = λi(q0) of Lq, such that

λ1 < λ2 < ··· < λn.

From our assumption, we know that given any neighborhood U of F , there exists t0 such
that γ(t) ∈ U for t > t0. In particular, all the accumulation points of the half-trajectory γ+
must be contained in F . We seek to show that γ+ has a unique accumulation point, and
that point is a stationary point of vσ.
Note that if x ∈ F is an accumulation point of γ+, then all the points on the ﬂow trajec-
tory ζ through x are also accumulation points. Indeed, if {Φt} denotes the ﬂow of vσ, and
γ(tn) → x = ζ(0), then γ(tn + t) = Φt(γ(tn)) → Φt(x) = ζ(t). The trajectory ζ is contained
in F , where the ﬂow is a gradient ﬂow, and therefore ζ limits to two stationary points
x = (q0, 0, [φi]) and y = (q0, 0, [φj]) at ∓∞. Moreover, x and y have to be accumulation
points for γ+ as well, and we have x = y if and only if ζ is stationary.
Therefore, we are left to show that γ+ cannot have two diﬀerent stationary points x, y ∈ F
as accumulation points. Suppose that were the case, and let λi > λj be the eigenvalues
corresponding to x and y. These are also the values of Λ at x and y. Pick an intermediate
value λ ∈ (λj, λi), such that λ (cid:54)= λk for any k. Since vσ restricts to be the gradient of 1
2 Λ
on F , we have

dΛ(vσ) > 0 on Λ−1(λ) ∩ F.

Since Λ−1(λ) ∩ F is compact, we can ﬁnd a neighborhood U ⊂ V of F such that
(17)

dΛ(vσ) > 0 on Λ−1(λ) ∩ U.

Because x and y are accumulation points of γ+, it must be that the half-trajectory γ+
intersects the intermediate level set Λ−1(λ) inﬁnitely many times. Furthermore, we know
that after a certain time t0, the trajectory γ+ is contained in U . However, this contradicts
(17), which says that Λ decreases every time the trajectory goes through Λ−1(λ) ∩ U . The
(cid:3)
conclusion follows.

Since the stationary points of vσ are hyperbolic, they admit stable and unstable manifolds;
cf. the discussion in Section 2.3. Further, we can separate the stationary points on the
boundary into stable and unstable, and then deﬁne the notion of boundary-obstructed
trajectories, as in Section 2.5.

Deﬁnition 2.24. A Morse equivariant quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld ˜v on X is called Morse-
Smale if the induced vector ﬁeld vσ on X σ/S1 satisﬁes the Morse-Smale condition for
boundary-unobstructed trajectories; and the Morse-Smale condition inside ∂(X σ/S1) for
the boundary-obstructed trajectories.

If we have a Morse-Smale equivariant quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld, the constructions in
Section 2.5 carry through using vσ (even though vσ is not a quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld in
a natural way). In particular, Lemma 2.23 implies that vσ is a Morse-Smale vector ﬁeld as
in Deﬁnition 2.10; compare Lemma 2.11. Thus, we obtain a Morse complex

( ˇC(X σ/S1), ˇ∂)

which computes the homology of X σ/S1.
The space X σ/S1 can be viewed as an approximation to the homotopy quotient X//S1 :=
X ×S1 ES1. Precisely, let n be the connectivity of the pair (X, X − Q), that is, the largest

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

j such that (X, X − Q) is j-connected. Note that if the real codimension of Q in X is 2c,
then n ≥ 2c − 1. Since X σ is S1-equivariantly homotopy equivalent to X − Q, we have an
isomorphism in homology

Hj(X σ/S1) ∼= Hj(X//S1)

for all j ≤ n−1. The homology H∗(X//S1) ∼= H S1∗ (X) is the S1-equivariant Borel homology

(18)

of X.

2.7. The U -action in Morse homology. We keep the same setting as in the previous
subsection. The equivariant homology H S1∗ (X) admits a natural Z[U ]-module structure,
S1(pt) ∼= Z[U ]. (The action of U decreases de-
given by cap products with the elements of H∗
gree by two.) Our goal here is to explain how this module structure can be approximated in
terms of Morse theory. The discussion is modeled on the inﬁnite-dimensional case presented
in [KMOS07, Section 4.11].

The circle action on X σ produces a natural complex line bundle Eσ on X σ/S1. Let ζ
be a generic, smooth section of Eσ, such that ζ is transverse to the 0-section and further,
ζ restricted to the boundary, N 1(Q)/S1 is transverse to restriction of the 0-section to the
boundary. Note that ζ inherits a canonical orientation from X σ/S1. Let Z denote the zero
set of ζ, which is a manifold with boundary ∂Z = Z ∩ (N 1(Q)/S1). From the orientation
of ζ and X σ/S1, we obtain an orientation on Z .

Notice that a trajectory γ of vσ is determined by its value at time t = 0. Thus, we can

deﬁne cut-down moduli spaces by intersecting M (x, y) with Z at time t = 0:

M (x, y) ∩ Z := {γ ∈ M (x, y) | γ(0) ∈ Z }.

Given (θ, ) ∈ {(o, o), (o, s), (u, o), (u, s)}, we deﬁne maps of the form mθ

 : ˇCθ∗ (X σ/S1) →

ˇC∗−2(X σ/S1) by counting ﬂows that intersect Z :

mθ

(x) =

#(M (x, y) ∩ Z ) · y.

Note that the conditions on the gradings of x and y guarantee that the cut-down moduli

of X:

¯mθ

x =

#(M (x, y) ∩ ∂Z ) · y,

where we only consider y where the relevant cut-down moduli space is 0-dimensional. Fur-

The map induced by ˇm on the homology H∗(X σ/S1) is exactly the cap product with

the isomorphism (18) discussed in the previous subsection,

(20)
is actually an isomorphism of Z[U ]-modules. Thus, Morse theory tells us the action of Z[U ]
on H S1∗ (X) in degrees up to n − 1.

2.8. Combined generalizations. The versions of Morse homology described in Sections 2.4
and 2.5 can be combined as follows. Let X be a (possibly non-compact) manifold with
boundary. Fix a metric g and a Morse quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld v on X as in Section 2.5,
and let S ⊆ X be an isolated invariant set of the resulting ﬂow. Although our deﬁni-
tions in Section 2.4 were for ﬂows on manifolds without boundary, Conley index theory
easily extends to the boundary case, provided that the gradient vector ﬁeld is tangent to
the boundary; compare [Hel09, Section 3.1.2]. The only caveat is that in Deﬁnitions 2.13
and 2.14, the interior of a subset A ⊆ X should be deﬁned as in point-set topology, without
regard to the structure of X as a manifold-with-boundary. With this in mind, the Conley
index of S is deﬁned as before, to be the quotient N/L of an index pair (N, L) for S . Al-
ternatively, we could consider the double D(X) of X with its Z/2-action, and appeal to the
equivariant Conley index theory developed in [Flo87, Pru99]. This guarantees the existence
of a Z/2-equivariant Conley index of D(S ) on D(X), well-deﬁned up to Z/2-equivariant
homotopy equivalence. In particular, its quotient by Z/2, which we take to be the Conley
index of S on X, is well-deﬁned up to homotopy equivalence. This is equivalent to [Hel09,
Deﬁnition 3.1.32].

We now impose a Morse-Smale condition for the trajectories in S as in Section 2.5,
where in the boundary-obstructed case we only require transversality inside ∂X. We then
construct a complex ˇC[S ] using the same formula (11), but involving only the stationary
points and the ﬂow trajectories in S . The homology of ˇC[S ] will be the reduced homology
of the Conley index associated to S .

Starting from this, we can also combine the construction in Section 2.4 with those in
Sections 2.6-2.7. Suppose that X is a (possibly non-compact) Riemannian manifold X with
a smooth, semifree S1-action by isometries. (In our applications, X will be a vector space
of the form Rm ⊕ Cn, with the linear S1-action.) Let ˜v be a smooth vector ﬁeld on X, and
S ⊆ X be an S1-invariant, isolated invariant set in the ﬂow of ˜v. Let Q, X σ, vσ, Lq be
constructed as in Section 2.6. Given a closed S1-invariant subset M ⊂ X, we will denote by
M σ the closure of the preimage of M − Q in X σ. We seek to form a complex ˇC(X σ/S1)[S ]
using only trajectories in S σ/S1. In order to do this, we require that we can ﬁnd an S1-
invariant isolating neighborhood A of S such that the restriction of ˜v to A is a Morse-Smale
equivariant quasi-gradient vector ﬁeld in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.24.

Under these assumptions, we obtain the desired Morse complex ˇC(X σ/S1)[S ] using
trajectories in Aσ/S1. Observe that S σ/S1 is an isolated invariant set for the ﬂow of vσ
on X σ/S1; let I(S σ/S1) be its Conley index. We have:

(21)

H∗( ˇC(X σ/S1)[S ]) ∼= ˜H∗(I(S σ/S1)).

On the other hand, S is an isolated invariant set itself, and is ﬁxed by the S1-action.
We may choose an index pair which is S1-invariant [Flo87, Pru99], and we thus get an
S1-equivariant Conley index IS1(S ). Let (IS1(S ))S1 be its ﬁxed point set. The Morse
homology in (21) approximates the reduced equivariant homology of IS1(S ), in the sense
that:

(22)

where n is the connectivity of the pair(cid:0)IS1(S ),(cid:0)IS1(S )−(IS1(S ))S1(cid:1)∪∗(cid:1), with ∗ denoting

H≤n−1( ˇC(X σ/S1)[S ]) ∼= ˜H S1≤n−1(IS1(S )),

the basepoint in IS1(S ); compare (20). Moreover, after choosing a suitable section ζ of Eσ
as in Section 2.7, the isomorphism in (22) becomes one of Z[U ]-modules.

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

25

Finally, recall that in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 we described alternative ways of stating the
Morse-Smale condition and of constructing orientations. These descriptions apply equally
well to the more general settings discussed here.

3. The Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum

We review here the construction of the Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum SWF(Y, s), fol-

lowing [Man03].

3.1. The conﬁguration space and the gauge group action. We will be studying the
Seiberg-Witten equations on a tuple (Y, g, s, S), where Y is a rational homology three-sphere,
g is a metric on Y , s is a Spinc structure on Y , and S is a spinor bundle for s. We choose
a ﬂat Spinc connection A0 on S which gives an aﬃne identiﬁcation of Ω1(Y ; iR) with Spinc
connections on S.

We will be doing analysis on the conﬁguration space

C(Y ) = Ω1(Y ; iR) ⊕ Γ(S).

Of course, C(Y ) also depends on s, but we omit it from the notation. The gauge group
G = G(Y ) := C∞(Y, S1) acts on C(Y ) by u · (a, φ) = (a − u−1du, u · φ). Since b1(Y ) = 0,
each u ∈ G can be written as ef for some f : Y → iR. We deﬁne the normalized gauge

group G◦ to consist of those u = ef ∈ G such that(cid:82)

Y f = 0.

For any integer k, following [KM07], we let Hk denote the completion of a subspace
H ⊆ C(Y ) with respect to the L2
k Sobolev norm. In particular, the completion of W is
denoted Wk. The Sobolev norm is deﬁned in the standard way using the L2 norms of
iterated gradients ∇j, as in [KM07, Section 5.1]. For j ≤ k, deﬁne Tj as the L2
j completion
of TCk(Y ). (In particular, Tk is TCk(Y ).)
3.2. Coulomb slices. We have a global Coulomb slice4:

W = ker d∗ ⊕ Γ(S) ⊂ C(Y ),

where d∗ is meant to act on imaginary 1-forms. Given (a, φ) ∈ C(Y ), there is a unique
element of W which is obtained from (a, φ) by a normalized gauge transformation; this
element is called the global Coulomb projection of (a, φ). Explicitly, the global Coulomb
projection of (a, φ) is

(23)

where f : Y → iR is such that d∗(a − df ) = 0 and(cid:82)

ΠgC(a, φ) = (a − df, ef φ),

the Green’s operator of ∆ = d∗d. For future reference, let us denote by

Y f = 0; that is, f = Gd∗a, where G is

π : Ω1(Y ; iR) → ker d∗

the L2-orthogonal projection, given by π(a) = a − df = a − dGd∗a.

(ΠgC∗ )(a,φ)(b, ψ) =(cid:0)b − dGd∗b, eGd∗a(ψ + (Gd∗b)φ)(cid:1).

The derivative of ΠgC is called the inﬁnitesimal global Coulomb projection, given by

In particular, if (a, φ) happens to be already in W , we have

(ΠgC∗ )(a,φ)(b, ψ) = (b − dξ, ψ + ξφ) = (π(b), ψ + ξφ) ∈ T(a,φ)W,

(24)
where ξ = Gd∗b.

Analogous to the deﬁnition of Tj, let T gC

j completion of the tangent bundle
to Wk, namely the trivial vector bundle with ﬁber Wj over Wk. We keep the notation T gC

be the L2

4The global Coulomb slice was denoted V in [Man03]. We switched to W in order to avoid confusion

with the spaces denoted V(Z) in [KM07], which will also appear in this paper.

(rather than just Wk × Wj) to emphasize the bundle structure; this will be convenient when
we discuss bundle decompositions.

Let us mention the following lemma, which will be of use to us later:

Lemma 3.1. Let k ≥ 2. View the inﬁnitesimal global Coulomb projection as a section of
the bundle Hom(TC(Y ), T W ) over W , i.e., a map from W to Hom(C(Y ), W ), given by

(a, φ) (cid:55)→(cid:0)(b, ψ) (cid:55)→ (ΠgC∗ )(a,φ)(b, ψ)(cid:1).

Then, this map extends to smooth maps between the Sobolev completions

Wk → Hom(Cj(Y ), Wj)

for all −k ≤ j ≤ k.

Proof. Recall the formula (24):

(ΠgC∗ )(a,φ)(b, ψ) = (b − dGd∗b, ψ + (Gd∗b)φ).

Observe that d and d∗ decrease Sobolev coeﬃcients by one, the Green operator G increases
k →
them by 2. Because Sobolev multiplication L2
(cid:3)
Hom(L2

j induces a smooth map L2

Inﬁnitesimally, we can consider a diﬀerent slice to the gauge action, the one perpendicular
to the orbits in the L2 metric. This is the local Coulomb slice at (a, φ) ∈ C(Y ), denoted
K(a,φ), and consisting of those tangent vectors (b, ψ) ∈ T(a,φ)C(Y ) such that
(25)
Away from the reducibles, we see that Tk splits into a direct sum of two bundles:

− d∗b + i Re(cid:104)iφ, ψ(cid:105) = 0.

Tk = Jk ⊕ Kk,

where Jk consists of the vectors tangent to the Gk+1 orbits, and Kk is the completion of
the local Coulomb slice. Note that the local Coulomb slice does not form a bundle over the
entire conﬁguration space, since the local Coulomb slice is “bigger” at reducibles.
Given any (b, ψ) ∈ T(a,φ)C(Y ), we deﬁne the (inﬁnitesimal) local Coulomb projection of

(b, ψ) to be

(a,φ)(b, ψ) := (b − dζ, ψ + ζφ),
ΠlC
where ζ : Y → iR is, for φ (cid:54)= 0, the unique function such that
(26)

− d∗(b − dζ) + i Re(cid:104)iφ, ψ + ζφ(cid:105) = 0.

The existence and uniqueness of such a ζ follow from [KM07, Proposition 9.3.4]. When
φ = 0, we again ask for (31) to be satisﬁed, but to guarantee uniqueness we also impose the

condition(cid:82)

Y ζ = 0.

Note that both types of Coulomb slices are also mentioned by Kronheimer and Mrowka;

see [KM07, Sections 9.3 and 9.6].

For our purposes, we will also need the enlarged local Coulomb slice, which consists of
vectors that are only required to be perpendicular to the orbits of the normalized gauge
group action. We denote this by Ke
(a,φ) if and only
if −d∗b + i Re(cid:104)iφ, ψ(cid:105) is a constant function. Equivalently, we can write this condition as
(27)

(a,φ). A vector (b, ψ) ∈ T(a,φ)C(Y ) is in Ke

To see that they are inverse to each other, it suﬃces to note that both are given by adding

Here is the analogue of Lemma 3.1 for ΠelC instead of (ΠgC∗ ).

Lemma 3.3. Let k ≥ 2. View the enlarged local Coulomb projection as a section of the

(a,φ)(b, ψ)(cid:1).

Then, this map extends to smooth maps between the Sobolev completions

for all −k ≤ j ≤ k.
Proof. The fact that the extension to Sobolev completions is well-deﬁned was established
in Lemma 3.2. Smoothness can be deduced from Lemma 3.1, using the fact that ΠelC

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

We let X denote the L2-gradient of CSD:

X (a, φ) = (∗da + τ (φ, φ), Daφ),

where τ (φ, φ) = ρ−1(φφ∗)0 is a quadratic function coming from the Cliﬀord multiplication.
It is not diﬃcult to check that the CSD functional is gauge-invariant (since b1(Y ) = 0).
The critical points of L are the solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations,

X (a, φ) = 0.

If the spinor φ is identically 0, then the solution (a, φ) is said to be reducible.

By measuring the length of the enlarged local Coulomb projections of tangent vectors
to W , we obtain a Riemannian metric ˜g on W . Explicitly, for any tangent vector (b, ψ) to
(a, φ) ∈ W , we set5
(36)

(cid:104)(b, ψ), (b(cid:48), ψ(cid:48))(cid:105)˜g = Re (cid:104)ΠelC

(a,φ)(b(cid:48), ψ(cid:48))(cid:105)L2.

(a,φ)(b, ψ), ΠelC

For future reference, let us mention that, since ΠelC

can also write

(37)

(cid:104)(b, ψ), (b(cid:48), ψ(cid:48))(cid:105)˜g = Re (cid:104)(b, ψ), ΠelC

(a,φ) is an L2-orthogonal projection, we
(a,φ)(b(cid:48), ψ(cid:48))(cid:105)L2.

The metric ˜g has the property that the trajectories of the gradient ﬂow of L restricted to
W are precisely the global Coulomb projections of the original gradient ﬂow trajectories in
C(Y ). Therefore, in the global Coulomb slice with the metric ˜g, the (downward) gradient
ﬂow trajectories are given by

γ(t) = −(ΠgC∗ )γ(t)X (γ(t)),

d
dt

(38)
where γ(t) = (a(t), φ(t)). Note that X = gradL is perpendicular to the level sets of L with
respect to the L2 metric, which contain the gauge orbits, so X is automatically contained
in the local Coulomb slices. We can split the right hand side of (38) into a linear part l and
a nonlinear part c, and re-write the ﬂow equation as

γ(t) = −(l + c)(γ(t)),

also that π denotes the orthogonal projection to ker d∗.

The ˜g-gradient of the restriction L|W extends to a map
X gC = l + c : Wk → Wk−1,

Y ξ(φ) = 0. Recall

such that l is a linear Fredholm operator, and c is quadratic.6 The linear operator l is
self-adjoint with respect to the L2 inner product, but not necessarily ˜g. Further, the map c
is continuous as a map from Wk to Wk, and thus compact as a map from Wk to Wk−1. The
corresponding ﬂow lines are called Seiberg-Witten trajectories (in Coulomb gauge). Such a

5The L2 inner product is Hermitian, and thus the real part gives a real inner product. This is what we

need to deﬁne a Riemannian metric.

6We chose our conventions to be in agreement with [KM07]. In [Man03], the map l + c went from Wk+1

to Wk.

trajectory γ = (a(t), φ(t)) : R → W is said to be of ﬁnite type if L(γ(t)) and (cid:107)φ(t)(cid:107)C0 are
bounded in t.

3.4. Finite-dimensional approximation. For λ > 1, let us denote by W λ the ﬁnite-
dimensional subspace of W spanned by the eigenvectors of l with eigenvalues in the interval
(−λ, λ).7 The L2 orthogonal projection from W to W λ will be denoted ˜pλ. We modify this
to make it smooth in λ, using the following preliminary deﬁnition:

(cid:90) 1

pλ
prel =

β(θ)˜pλ−θ−λ+θdθ,

(41)

(cid:82)

where β is a smooth, non-negative function that is non-zero exactly on (0, 1), and such that
R β(θ)dθ = 1.

Our pλ

prel was the one used in [Man03], where it was denoted pλ. In this paper, it will
be convenient to arrange for the smoothed projection to be the actual projection ˜pλ at an
inﬁnite sequence of λ’s. Let us ﬁx such a sequence:

λ•
1 < λ•

2 < . . .

such that λ•

norm on W , using l instead of the covariant derivative ∇. This produces a norm equivalent
to the usual one. With the deﬁnition in [Man03], the L2 projection ˜pλ would have been the
orthogonal projection to W λ with respect to the L2
k metric for any k, and we would have
had (cid:107)pλ(x)(cid:107)L2
. Given our choice of Sobolev norms, the same inequality holds up

We refer to solutions of (43) as approximate Seiberg-Witten trajectories.

7In [Man03], the role of W λ was played by W µ

λ , the subspace spanned by eigenvectors with eigenvalues
In this paper we restrict to µ = −λ; this produces the same spectrum. The reason
between λ and µ.
for the change is that in Section 7.2 we will need to turn the parameter space for λ into a manifold with
boundary, and it is easier to do so with only one degree of freedom. Also, notice that in [Man03, Section
4], the approximation W µ
λ was initially deﬁned as the span of eigenvectors with eigenvalues in (λ, µ], but
later changed so that it is the image of the smoothed projection pµ
λ. This means using the open interval
(λ, µ) instead of (λ, µ], and in fact it is easier to deﬁne the approximation as such from the beginning. In
our setting we use (−λ, λ).

Remark 3.4. If we consider the restriction of the CSD functional to W λ, its gradient with
respect to ˜g is

˜pλ
˜g (l + c)˜pλ

˜g = l + ˜pλ

˜g c˜pλ
˜g ,

˜g denotes the ˜g-orthogonal projection onto W λ. It would be rather cumbersome to
˜g with the L2 orthogonal projection ˜pλ. When

where ˜pλ
work with these projections, so we replaced ˜pλ
λ is one of the cut-oﬀs λ•

i , on W λ we have

˜pλ(l + c)˜pλ = l + ˜pλc = l + pλc.

However, even in this case (when λ = λ•
i ), we expect that l + pλc is neither the L2 nor the
˜g gradient of a function. We will show in Section 8 that l + pλc is a quasi-gradient, so it
can still be used to do Morse theory.

Fix a natural number k ≥ 5. There exists a constant R > 0, such that all Seiberg-
Witten trajectories γ : R → W of ﬁnite type are contained in B(R), the ball of radius R in
Wk. The following is a corresponding compactness result for approximate Seiberg-Witten
trajectories:

Proposition 3.5 (Proposition 3 in [Man03]). For any λ suﬃciently large (compared to R),
if γ : R → W λ is a trajectory of (l + pλc), and γ(t) is in B(2R) for all t, then in fact γ(t)
is contained in B(R).

This was proved in [Man03] with pλ

prel instead of pλ, but the same arguments work in our

setting.

3.5. The Conley index and the Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum. Recall the def-
inition of the Conley index from Section 2.4, and of the S1-equivariant reﬁnement IS1
mentioned at the end of Section 2.8.

With this in mind, we are ready to deﬁne the Seiberg-Witten Floer spectrum. We ﬁx k,
R, and suﬃciently large λ such that Proposition 3.5 applies. We consider the vector ﬁeld
uλ(l +pλc) on W λ, where uλ is a smooth, S1-invariant, cut-oﬀ function on W λ that vanishes
outside of B(3R). This generates the ﬂow φλ that we will work with. Denote by Sλ the
union of all trajectories of φλ inside B(R). Recall from Proposition 3.5 that these are the
same as the trajectories that stay in B(2R). This implies that Sλ is an isolated invariant
set.

Since everything is S1-invariant, we can construct the equivariant Conley index I λ =
IS1(φλ, Sλ). We must de-suspend appropriately to make the stable homotopy type inde-
pendent of λ:

SWF(Y, s, g) = Σ−W (−λ,0)

I λ,

where W (−λ,0) denotes the direct sum of the eigenspaces of l with eigenvalues in the interval
(−λ, 0). As we vary the metric g, the spectrum SWF(Y, s, g) varies by suspending (or de-
suspending) with copies of the vector space C. In [Man03], this indeterminacy is ﬁxed by
introducing a quantity n(Y, s, g) ∈ Q (a linear combination of eta invariants), and setting

SWF(Y, s) = Σ−n(Y,s,g)C

SWF(Y, s, g),

where the de-suspension by rational numbers is deﬁned formally. For the deﬁnition of
n(Y, s, g), see (233) below. We have:

Theorem 3.6 (Theorem 1 in [Man03]). The S1-equivariant stable homotopy type of SWF(Y, s)
is an invariant of the pair (Y, s).

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

33

Remark 3.7. The construction of SWF(Y, s) in [Man03] used the smoothed projections
prel and pλ, and using the homotopy invariance
pλ
prel. By interpolating linearly between pλ
properties of the Conley index, we see that the deﬁnitions from pλ and pλ
prel yield the same
SWF(Y, s).

4. Monopole Floer homology

In this section we review the deﬁnition of monopole Floer homology given by Kronheimer
and Mrowka in their book [KM07]. Recall that we are considering the case of a rational
homology sphere Y and Spinc structure s, which is necessarily torsion.
In this case, all
of the reducible solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations are gauge equivalent. While we
worked in the Coulomb gauge for the Floer spectrum, for now, we will return to the entire
conﬁguration space

C(Y ) = Ω1(Y ; iR) ⊕ Γ(S)

(where we have made this identiﬁcation via a ﬁxed ﬂat Spinc connection).

Here are the main ideas in the construction of monopole Floer homology: One would
like to proceed by analogy with Morse homology; that is, to build a chain complex whose
generators are given by gauge-equivalence classes of critical points of the CSD functional
and whose diﬀerential counts gradient trajectories between them. However, there are several
technical issues that need to be addressed. One issue is that the gauge group does not act
freely near the reducible solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations, and these points cause
a serious problem. This problem was solved by Kronheimer and Mrowka by blowing up
the singular set, in a way similar to the construction of S1-equivariant Morse homology in
Section 2.6. The second problem is that even after performing a blow-up, transversality
may still not be satisﬁed for the moduli spaces. For this reason, special perturbations to
the CSD functional must be introduced.

4.1. Seiberg-Witten equations on the blow-up. We will often work on cylinders of
the form Z = I × Y , where I is an interval (possibly R). The Spinc structure on Y induces
a Spinc structure on Z with unitary rank 4 bundle S+ ⊕ S− on Z; here, S± are the ∓1
eigenspaces of ρ(d volZ), where ρ is the induced Cliﬀord multiplication for diﬀerential forms
on Z. Both S+ and S− can be identiﬁed with the pull-backs of S under the projection
p : Z → Y . Again identifying 1-forms with Spinc connections, we have

C(Z) = {(a, φ) | a ∈ Ω1(Z; iR), φ ∈ Γ(S+)}.

This is acted on by the gauge group G(Z) = C∞(Z, S1). An element of C(Z) in temporal
gauge (i.e., such that the dt component of a is zero) corresponds to a path γ(t) = (a(t), φ(t))
in C(Y ), and we will often not distinguish between these. Note that every element of C(Z)
is gauge-equivalent to a conﬁguration in temporal gauge.
We write down the four-dimensional Seiberg-Witten equations on Z as F(a, φ) = 0,

where

F(a, φ) = (d+a − ρ−1((φφ∗)0), D+

a φ) ∈ Ω2

+(Z; iR) ⊕ Γ(S−),

a : Γ(S+) → Γ(S−) is the Dirac operator and d+a is the self-dual part of da.

and D+
If
F(γ) = 0, then γ represents a Seiberg-Witten trajectory. If γ is the constant path, then this
is giving a solution to the Seiberg-Witten equations on Y . In general, F(γ) = 0 is equivalent
to γ being a downward gradient trajectory of L. We will often go back and forth between
this notion of trajectories of gradL = X on Y and solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations
on Z. We will also think of F as a section of C(Z) into V(Z), the trivial Γ(Z; iΛ2
+T ∗Z ⊕S−)
bundle over C(Z).

As discussed above, in order to deal with the reducible solution, we must blow-up our

conﬁguration spaces. We ﬁrst consider

Cσ(Y ) = {(a, s, φ) | s ≥ 0,(cid:107)φ(cid:107)L2 = 1} ⊂ Ω1(Y ; iR) × R≥0 × Γ(S).

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

35

We can deﬁne Cσ(Z) similarly, as the space of triples (a, s, φ) ∈ Ω1(Z; iR)×R≥0×Γ(S+) with
(cid:107)φ(cid:107)L2(Z) = 1. The blown-up Seiberg-Witten equations on Cσ(Z) are given by F σ(a, s, φ) = 0,
where F σ is a section of a bundle V σ(Z) over Cσ(Z), deﬁned to be the pullback of V(Z)
under the blow-down from Cσ(Z) to C(Z); see [KM07, p.115]. Explicitly, we have

F σ(a, s, φ) = (d+a − s2ρ−1((φφ∗)0), D+

a φ).

However, there is a variant of the four-dimensional blow-up that is more directly related
to paths in Cσ(Y ). This is the so-called τ model deﬁned in [KM07, Section 6.3]. Precisely,
we let

Cτ (Z) ⊂ Ω1(Z; iR) × C∞(I) × C∞(Z; S+)

be the space of triples (a, s, φ) with s(t) ≥ 0 and (cid:107)φ(t)(cid:107)L2(Y ) = 1 for all t ∈ I. After moving
it into temporal gauge, an element of Cτ (Z) determines a path γσ(t) = (a(t), s(t), φ(t)) in
Cσ(Y ).
In temporal gauge on Cτ (Z), the blown-up Seiberg-Witten equations can be written as

a(t) = − ∗ da(t) − s(t)2τ (φ(t), φ(t))
s(t) = −Λ(a(t), s(t), φ(t))s(t)
φ(t) = −Da(t)φ(t) + Λ(a(t), s(t), φ(t))φ(t),

d
dt
d
dt
d
dt

where

Λ(a, s, φ) = (cid:104)φ, Daφ(cid:105)L2.

(44)
Furthermore, the right hand sides of these equations induce a vector ﬁeld, denoted X σ, on
Cσ(Y ) whose ﬂow trajectories are precisely the solutions to the three equations above. The
zeros of X σ on Cσ(Y ) are easily rephrased in terms of the zeros of X on C(Y ):
Proposition 4.1 (Proposition 6.2.3 in [KM07]). If s > 0, then (a, s, φ) ∈ Cσ(Y ) is a zero
of X σ in Cσ(Y ) if and only if (a, sφ) is a zero of X in C(Y ). If s = 0, then (a, s, φ) is a
zero if and only if (a, 0) is a zero of X and φ is an eigenvector of Da.
Remark 4.2. Since b1(Y ) = 0, we have that (a, 0) is a zero of X if and only if a = 0.

Throughout this section, we ﬁx an integer k ≥ 2. We may also blow up the Sobolev
k (Y ) such that X σ extends. Similarly, we can complete the
completions to obtain spaces Cσ
gauge group G to Gk. This leads to the various blown-up conﬁguration spaces mod gauge:

B(Y ) = C(Y )/G, Bσ(Y ) = Cσ(Y )/G, Bk(Y ) = Ck(Y )/Gk+1, Bσ

In four dimensions, we can similarly divide the blown up conﬁguration space Cσ(Z) by
gauge to obtain a space Bσ(Z). In the τ model, we deﬁne the quotient conﬁguration space
Bτ (Z) = Cτ (Z)/G(Z). Also, starting from the bundle V(Z) over C(Z), we obtain a bundle
V τ (Z) over Cτ (Z). Explicitly, the ﬁber of V τ (Z) over (a, s, φ) is

V τ (Z)(a,s,φ) = {(b, r, ψ) | Re(cid:104)φ(t), ψ(t)(cid:105)L2(Y ) = 0, ∀t}

⊂ C∞(Z; iΛ2

+T ∗Z) ⊕ C∞(R) ⊕ C∞(Z; S−).

In the τ model, the blown-up Seiberg-Witten equations on Z can be written as the zeros
of a section F τ of the bundle V τ (Z); see [KM07, Equations (6.11)] for the exact formula.
In temporal gauge, we simply have

F τ =

j (Z) and T τ

When Z is a compact cylinder, that is, Z = [t1, t2]×Y , we deﬁne the Sobolev completions
Ck(Z), Bk(Z), Vk(Z), and similarly with σ or τ superscripts. We also have completed
tangent bundles Tj(Z), T σ
k (Z) are
Hilbert manifolds with boundary, so the tangent bundles make sense. The τ model Cτ
k (Z)
is not a Hilbert manifold, even with boundary. Nevertheless, it is a closed subset of the

j (Z). We should note that Cσ

(cid:101)Cτ (Z) = {(a, s, φ) | (cid:107)φ(t)(cid:107)L2(Y ) = 1, ∀t} ⊂ Ω1(Z; iR) × C∞([t1, t2]) × C∞(Z; S+);

The bundle V τ (Z) extends naturally over (cid:101)Cτ (Z) as well. When discussing V τ (Z), this will

As mentioned in Section 3, gauge transformations preserve the property of being a
Seiberg-Witten trajectory; this extends through blow-ups and Sobolev completions. Mono-

We will also write Lq for L + f , so Xq = gradLq. Note that q is described by its components
q0 to Ω1(Y ; iR) and q1 to Γ(S). More generally, from now on we will use the superscripts 0
and 1 to describe the 1-form and spinorial parts of vectors in C(Y ).
The perturbation q also induces a section ˆq : C(Z) → V0(Z). When Z = [t1, t2] × Y is a
compact cylinder, we will require that this actually extends to a smooth section Ck(Z) →
Vk(Z).

The ﬂow trajectories (a(t), φ(t)) of Xq are solutions to the equations

where

Λq(a, s, φ) = Re(cid:104)φ, Daφ + ˜q1(a, s, φ)(cid:105)L2.

These are the solutions to the perturbed Seiberg-Witten equations on the blow-up in temporal
gauge, or F σ
q = 0 for short. We call Λq(a, s, φ) the spinorial energy of (a, s, φ). Note that
for an irreducible stationary point (a, s, φ), we must have Λq(a, s, φ) = 0.

We can now state the perturbed analogue of Proposition 4.1. First, we deﬁne the operator

Dq,a : L2

q if and only if:

k(Y ; S) → L2

k−1(Y ; S), Dq,a(φ) = Daφ + D(a,0)q1(0, φ).
Proposition 4.3 (Proposition 10.3.1 of [KM07]). The element (a, s, φ) in Cσ
of X σ
(a) s (cid:54)= 0 and (a, sφ) is a stationary point of Xq, or
(b) s = 0 and (a, 0) is a stationary point of Xq and φ is an eigenvector of Dq,a.
Remark 4.4. A stationary point of the form (a, 0) is called reducible. Recall from Remark 4.2
that the unperturbed Seiberg-Witten vector ﬁeld X has a unique reducible stationary point
mod gauge, namely a = 0. We claim that, when q is small, the perturbed ﬁeld Xq also has a
unique reducible stationary point. Indeed, notice that the linear map ∗d : L2
k(Y ; iT ∗Y ) →
k−1(Y ; iT ∗Y ) induces an invertible map from (ker d∗)k to (ker d∗)k−1. Note also that
L2
j (Y ; iT ∗Y ) of the tangents to the gauge orbits
(ker d∗)j is the L2 orthogonal complement in L2
of connections. Therefore, by the inverse function theorem, for a small perturbation q, there

k(Y ; iT ∗Y ) mod gauge, in a neighborhood of 0, satisfying ∗da + q0(a, 0) =

0. (Here we are using that q is L2 orthogonal to the tangents of the gauge-orbits, since
it is the formal gradient of a gauge-equivariant function.) By elliptic bootstrapping, a
is smooth. Further, by gauge-equivariance, we have q1(a, 0) = 0 and we can conclude
that (a, 0) provides the unique reducible solution to Xq near zero. Using the compactness
properties of the perturbed Seiberg-Witten equations, it also follows that (for suﬃciently
small q) there are no reducible solutions outside the ﬁxed neighborhood of 0.

We will not, however, use the uniqueness of reducible solutions for small perturbations

in this paper.

4.3. Tame perturbations. We are interested in studying the moduli spaces of ﬂows of
X σ
q connecting stationary points. In order to obtain the desired compactiﬁcation results for
the moduli spaces, we require some conditions on q.
Let Z = [t1, t2] × Y be a compact cylinder. For every one-form a ∈ Ω1(Z; iR), we
can consider the Sobolev norm L2
k,a deﬁned using as covariant derivative the connection
corresponding to a, namely ∇A0+a. The L2
k,a norm is equivalent to the usual Sobolev norm,
and gives rise to the same Sobolev completion. However, when we want to state global
bounds it becomes important to specify the precise Sobolev norm. We will take the usual
norm on Ck(Y ),Ck(Z). However, on the bundles Vk(Z) and TCk(Z), in the ﬁber over (a, φ)
we will take the L2
Deﬁnition 4.5 (Deﬁnition 10.5.1 in [KM07]). Fix an integer k ≥ 2. Suppose that a section
q : C(Y ) → T0 is the formal gradient of a continuous, G-invariant function. We say q is a
k-tame perturbation if, for any compact cylinder Z = [t1, t2] × Y , the following hold:
(i) ˆq deﬁnes an element of C∞(Ck(Z),Vk(Z));
(ii) ˆq also deﬁnes an element of C0(Cj(Z),Vj(Z)), for all integers j ∈ [1, k];
(iii) The derivative Dˆq ∈ C∞(Ck(Z), Hom(Tk(Z),Vk(Z))) extends to a smooth map into

k,a norm; this turns them into gauge-invariant normed vector bundles.

Hom(Tj(Z),Vj(Z)), for all integers j ∈ [−k, k];

(iv) There exists a constant m such that

for all (a, φ) ∈ Ck(Y );

(v) For any a0 ∈ iΩ1(Z), there is a function h : R → R such that

(cid:107)q(a, φ)(cid:107)L2 ≤ m((cid:107)φ(cid:107)L2 + 1),

for all (a, φ) ∈ Ck(Z);

(vi) q extends to a C1 section of C1(Y ) into T0.
We say that q is tame if it is k-tame for all k ≥ 2.

Remark 4.6. Conditions (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) are phrased in terms of the four-dimensional
perturbation ˆq, but they readily imply the analogous statements for q. For example, from
part (i) in Deﬁnition 4.5, we know that for a tame perturbation q, ˆq gives a smooth map
from Ck(Z) to Vk(Z), for all k ≥ 1. For x ∈ Ck(Y ), we can consider the element of Ck(Z)

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

that is constantly x in every slice {t} × Y . Its image under ˆq is constantly q(x) in every
slice, so we conclude that q(x) is in Vk(Y ).

For a tame perturbation q, the set of solutions to Xq = 0, topologized as a subspace of
q between two stationary
k (Y ) is gauge-equivalent to a smooth trajectory, which thus lives in Cσ(Y ); no

Bk(Y ), is compact for tame q. In this case, any trajectory of X σ
points in Cσ
Sobolev completion is necessary.

Kronheimer and Mrowka construct explicitly a collection of tame perturbations which
are the gradient of cylinder functions. We will not deﬁne these here. However, we will
always need to work with a space of perturbations that does contain them.
Deﬁnition 4.7. A separable Banach space P is a large Banach space of tame perturbations
if there exists a map P → C0(C(Y ),T0) which takes x to qx such that:
(i) the image of this map contains a countably inﬁnite family of perturbations which are
(ii) qx is tame for all x ∈ P,
(iii) for k ≥ 2, the map P × Ck(I × Y ) → Vk(I × Y ) is smooth for any compact interval I
(iv) the map P × C1(Y ) → T1(Y ) is continuous, and
(v) there exist a constant m and a map µ : R → R such that P × C1(Y ) → T1(Y ) satisﬁes

4.4. Very tame perturbations. We now make a digression. For the purposes of doing
ﬁnite dimensional approximation (as we shall do in this paper), we need slightly stronger
assumptions on the perturbation q than the ones in Deﬁnition 4.5. We give the relevant
deﬁnitions here. These concepts are new material; they did not appear in [KM07].
Let us recall that a linear operator between Banach spaces, f : E → F , is continuous if
and only if it is bounded, i.e., there is a constant K such that (cid:107)f (x)(cid:107) ≤ K(cid:107)x(cid:107) for all x.
This condition is also equivalent to requiring f to take bounded sets to bounded sets. For
nonlinear operators, we introduce the following terminology.
Deﬁnition 4.8. Let E and F be Banach spaces. A map f : E → F is called functionally
bounded if f (B) ⊂ F is bounded whenever B ⊂ E is bounded. In other words, there exists
a function h : R → R such that

(cid:107)f (x)(cid:107) ≤ h((cid:107)x(cid:107)),

for all x ∈ E.

We use the term functionally bounded, rather than bounded, to prevent confusion with
the usual notion of bounded functions in analysis, which requires that (cid:107)f (x)(cid:107) ≤ K for some
K.

For non-linear operators, continuity does not imply functional boundedness; see [Exc].

We will need both of these conditions, so let us denote by

C0

fb(E, F )

the space of continuous and functionally bounded operators from E to F . Further, for
m ≥ 1 (and also for m = ∞), we let

fb (E, F ) = {f ∈ Cm(E, F ) | D(cid:96)f ∈ C0
Cm

fb(E, Hom(E×(cid:96), F )), (cid:96) = 0, . . . , m}.

With this in mind, we present the following strengthening of Deﬁnition 4.5.

Deﬁnition 4.9. Fix k ≥ 2. A k-tame perturbation q is called very k-tame if the following
additional conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) ˆq deﬁnes an element of C∞
(ii) ˆq also deﬁnes an element of C0
(iii) Dˆq deﬁnes an element of C∞
We say that q is very tame if it is very k-tame for all k ≥ 2.

fb (Ck(Z), Hom(TCj(Z),Vj(Z))), for all integers j ∈ [−k, k].

fb(Cj(Z),Vj(Z)), for all integers j ∈ [1, k];

Luckily, the kind of perturbations considered by Kronheimer and Mrowka in [KM07]

satisfy these additional conditions.

Lemma 4.10. Let q be the gradient of a cylinder function, as in [KM07, Section 11]. Then,
q is very tame.

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 11.4.1 and Lemma 11.4.4 in [KM07],
(cid:3)
along the lines of the proof of Theorem 11.1.2 on p.190 of [KM07].

We will need to ensure that both the perturbations we use are very tame and the space of
perturbations is suﬃciently large to guarantee transversality. This motivates the following
deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 4.11. A large Banach space of very tame perturbations is a large Banach space
of tame perturbations where each perturbation is additionally very tame.

Using Lemma 4.10, the proof of the existence of such a space follows as in the proof of

Theorem 11.6.1 in [KM07].

Fix a tame perturbation q and Sobolev number k. Note that X σ

4.5. Admissible perturbations. For Morse homology, we need non-degeneracy of the

Note also that the stationary points of X σ
q cannot be isolated like in Morse theory. This is
because the gauge group preserves stationary points. Therefore, this will be a Morse-Bott
condition, in the sense that the stationary points will be non-degenerate in the directions
transverse to the gauge orbits.

and φ is an eigenvector of Dq,a with eigenvalue λ, then (a, 0, φ) is non-degenerate if and
only if the following three conditions are satisﬁed:

(2) λ is a simple eigenvalue,

It turns out that one can always ﬁnd many perturbations such that the stationary points

are non-degenerate.

Theorem 4.14 (Theorem 12.1.2 in [KM07]). For any large Banach space of tame per-
turbations P, there is a residual subset of P such that for each perturbation q, all of the
stationary points of X σ

q are non-degenerate.

Given such a perturbation q, the gauge-equivalence classes of solutions to the perturbed
Seiberg-Witten equations on (Y, s) are isolated (this comes from being transverse to the
gauge orbits). Since these equivalence classes form a compact subset of Ck(Y )/Gk+1 because
of tameness, there are at most ﬁnitely many irreducible solutions in Bσ

k (Y ).

For the rest of the subsection, we will assume that q has been chosen so as to be tame
and that the stationary points are non-degenerate. In analogy with the ﬁnite-dimensional
case we have
Deﬁnition 4.15. Let [x] = [(a, s, φ)] be a gauge-equivalence class of zeros of X σ
k (Y ).
If s (cid:54)= 0, then we say that [x] is irreducible. If [x] is reducible, then [x] is boundary-stable
(respectively boundary-unstable) if Λq(x) > 0 (respectively < 0).

empty (this is the case when one of [x] or [y] is irreducible) or all of M ([x], [y]), except when
[x] is boundary-unstable and [y] is boundary-stable, in which case it is ∂M ([x], [y]).

Deﬁnition 4.19. An admissible perturbation is a tame perturbation such that all the sta-
tionary points are non-degenerate and all the moduli spaces are regular.

Theorem 4.20 (Theorem 15.1.1 in [KM07]). For any large Banach space of tame pertur-
bations P, there exists an admissible perturbation q ∈ P.

As discussed after Deﬁnition 4.11, there exist large Banach spaces of very tame pertur-

bations. Therefore, there exist perturbations which are both very tame and admissible.

8In Equation (49), Dτ is a covariant derivative on the space of paths, which was simply denoted D in

[KM07]. See Section 5.9 below for more details.

4.6. Orientations. From now on we ﬁx an admissible perturbation q.

Theorem 4.21 (Corollary 20.4.1 of [KM07]). The moduli spaces M ([x], [y]) are orientable
manifolds.

Let us sketch the construction of orientations on M ([x], [y]), following [KM07, Section
20]. This is similar to the discussion of specialized coherent orientations in Morse theory
(see Section 2.2).
To orient M ([x], [y]), we need to orient the determinant lines det(Qγ), where Qγ is as
in (49). For arbitrary x, y ∈ Cσ
k (Y ) (not necessarily stationary points), we consider instead
a compact interval I = [t1, t2], and a conﬁguration γ ∈ Cτ
k (I × Y ) whose restrictions to
{t1}× Y and {t2}× Y are gauge equivalent to x, resp. y. To any such γ we can associate an
operator Qγ by the same formula as for (49). To make it Fredholm, we need to add suitable
boundary conditions. At the boundary component {t1} × Y , consider the subspaces

where Π±

i denotes the composition of restriction to {ti} × Y with the projection to H±
i .

Let Λ(γ) be the set of orientations of det(Pγ). It is proved in [KM07, Proposition 20.3.4]
that there are canonical identiﬁcations between the diﬀerent Λ(γ) when we ﬁx the (gauge
equivalence classes of the) endpoints x and y of γ. Thus, we can write Λ([x], [y]) for Λ(γ).
Further, there are natural composition maps

Λ([x], [y]) × Λ([y], [z]) → Λ([x], [z]).

Departing slightly from the terminology and conventions in [KM07], we deﬁne an orien-
tation data set o for the admissible perturbation q to consists of elements o[x],[y] ∈ Λ([x], [y]),
one for each pair ([x], [y]), such that we have the relations
o[x],[y] · o[y],[z] = o[x],[z].

An orientation data set can be constructed as follows. In [KM07, p. 385-390] it is shown
that when [x] and [y] are reducible, the set Λ([x], [y]) can be canonically identiﬁed with
Z/2 = {±1}, in a way compatible with concatenation; we then choose o[x],[y] to be the
element +1 in this case. Then, we ﬁx a reducible [x0] and pick arbitrary elements o[x0],[x]
for all irreducibles [x]. This uniquely determines the data set o, using the concatenation
property.
Next, let [x] and [y] be stationary points, and consider a trajectory [γ] ∈ M ([x], [y]). Let
γ0 be its restriction to a large compact interval I = [t1, t2] ⊂ R. It is proved in [KM07,
Section 20.4] that an orientation for det(P[γ0]) determines one for det(Qγ). Therefore, an

44

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

orientation data set for q produces orientations for all determinant lines det(Qγ), and hence
for the moduli spaces M ([x], [y]). From here we also get orientations on the quotients
˘M ([x], [y]).

We can orient the moduli spaces M red([x], [y]) and ˘M red([x], [y]) in a similar manner.

Remark 4.22. In [KM07, Section 20], the discussion was more general, allowing the pertur-
bation q to vary for t ∈ [t1, t2]. For the purposes of this paper, it suﬃces to work with a
single perturbation q; we adjusted our discussion accordingly, for simplicity.

Furthermore, the notion of orientation data set did not appear in [KM07]. Whereas
we trivialize the sets Λ([x], [y]) and then let the monopole Floer complex be generated by
stationary points [x] (cf. Section 4.7 below), Kronheimer and Mrowka deﬁne the complex
more canonically, as generated by orientations of Λ([x0], [x]) (where [x0] is a ﬁxed reducible
basepoint), with two opposite orientations being set to be the negative of each other. The
two deﬁnitions are readily seen to be equivalent.

4.7. Monopole Floer homology. We will now deﬁne the monopole Floer chain complex

in Section 2.5.

The set Co of gauge-equivalence classes of irreducible stationary points of X σ

q is ﬁnite.
There are also countably many reducible stationary points, corresponding to the eigenvec-
tors of Dq,a. Indeed, the operator Dq,a is ASAFOE in the sense of [KM07, Deﬁnition 12.2.1],
so its spectrum is discrete by [KM07, Lemma 12.2.4].

In [KM07, Chapter V], Kronheimer and Mrowka give an analysis of the compactiﬁca-
tions of the moduli spaces via broken ﬂow lines. Rather than state the general result, we
simply point out that given an admissible perturbation, if ˘M ([x], [y]) or ˘M red([x], [y]) is
0-dimensional, then this moduli space is compact.
Let the groups Cθ be freely generated over Z by Cθ for θ ∈ {o, s, u}. The monopole Floer

chain groups are given by

Here, the relative Z-grading on }CM (Y, s, q) (since s is torsion) is given by the expected

dimension of M ([x], [y]) (the index of Qγ), since in this case, we cannot have that M ([x], [y])
is boundary-obstructed. Since Y is a rational homology sphere, this number is well-deﬁned
(there is only one homotopy class of paths from [x] to [y]). Recall that we need a shift of
grading by 1 in the boundary-obstructed case.

As in Remark 2.17, the moduli spaces M red([x], [y]) are either empty or equal to M ([x], [y]),
except in the case that [x] is boundary-unstable and [y] is boundary-stable; in this excep-
tional case, the counts of ˘M red([x], [y]) do not arise in ˇ∂.

Similar to the Morse homology for circle actions, monopole Floer homology can be given
the structure of a Z[U ]-module. This is deﬁned in [KM07] in terms of evaluations of suitable
ˇCech cochains on the 2-dimensional moduli spaces of parameterized trajectories. For our
purposes, it is more convenient to use an alternate, equivalent deﬁnition of the U map, which
is taken from [KMOS07, Section 4.11]. The latter deﬁnition involves counting points in zero-
dimensional spaces, and this will make it easier to prove a stability result for trajectories
in Section 13.2.

4.8. Gradings. Recall that for two stationary points x and y, the relative homological
grading between [x] and [y] is deﬁned by

gr([x], [y]) = ind Qγ,

k (x, y) is any path, and Qγ is the operator from (49). (See [KM07, Deﬁnition

where γ ∈ Cτ
14.4.4].)
Suppose that [x] and [y] are reducibles with the same blow-down projection (a, 0), and
correspond to eigenvalues µ and ν of Dq,a with µ ≥ ν. Then, an alternate formula for the
relative grading is given in [KM07, Corollary 14.6.2]:

(cid:40)

(58)

gr([x], [y]) =

2i(µ, ν)
2i(µ, ν) − 1

if µ and ν have the same sign,
otherwise.

where i(µ, ν) denotes the number of eigenvalues in the interval (ν, µ].

There is also an absolute rational grading gr

deﬁned in [KM07, Section 28.3]. Given a

Q

cobordism W from the round sphere S3 to Y , we have

Q

gr

([x]) := − grz([x0], W, [x]) +

c1(t)2 − σ(W )

− ι(W ),

4

where: [x0] is the reducible on S3 with the lowest positive eigenvalue; t is a Spinc structure
on W that restricts to s on Y ; grz([x0], W, [x]) is the relative grading between x0 and x
for the monopole map associated to (W, t), as in [KM07, Section 25]; the subscript z refers
to a connected component of the conﬁguration space of W , and in our case z is uniquely
determined by the Spinc structure t; and ι(W ) = (χ(W ) + σ(W ))/2 = b+(W ) − b1(W ).

For future reference, let us rephrase this deﬁnition in terms of a four-manifold X with
boundary Y . We can then take W to be the complement of a four-ball in X. Using
additivity of gr and a standard calculation on B4 we can replace W with X and write

where grz(X, [x]) is the expected dimension of the moduli space Mz(X∗; [x]) deﬁned in

5. Reduction to the Coulomb gauge

In this section, we recast the constructions from Section 4 entirely in the global Coulomb

slice

W = ker d∗ ⊕ Γ(S) ⊂ C(Y ).

This is needed in order to make contact with the construction of the Seiberg-Witten
Floer spectrum from Section 3, for which we used ﬁnite dimensional approximation on
W . Throughout this section k will denote a ﬁxed integer at least 2.

5.1. Bundle decompositions and projections. Recall that in Section 3.2 we introduced
the global Coulomb slice W , the global Coulomb projection ΠgC, the inﬁnitesimal global
Coulomb projection ΠgC∗ , the local Coulomb slice K, the (inﬁnitesimal) local Coulomb pro-
jection ΠlC, the enlarged local Coluomb slice Ke, the enlarged local Coulomb projection
ΠelC, and the metric ˜g on W . Further, in Section 4.1 we introduced the bundle decomposi-
tion of Tk into the tangents to the gauge orbits Jk and the local Coulomb slice Kk; we also
mentioned a similar decomposition in the blow-up, T σ

k = J σ

k ⊕ Kσ
k .

In this section we explore these constructions further. In particular, we extend the gauge
projections to the blow-up, and describe a few bundle decompositions that are related to
global Coulomb gauge.

For j ≤ k, recall that T gC

j

j

is the trivial vector bundle with ﬁber Wj over Wk. Unlike
what we did for Tj in Section 4.3, in the case of T gC
there is no need to deﬁne the Sobolev
norms using the varying covariant derivatives ∇A0+a. The Sobolev norm on Wj deﬁned
by ∇ = ∇A0 is invariant under the residual gauge action by S1, and this norm is what we
shall use on each tangent space. Thus, T gC
is exactly the trivial normed bundle Wk × Wj.
Again, we keep the notation T gC
(rather than just Wk × Wj) to emphasize the bundle
structure. Note that these two Sobolev norms are equivalent in the following strong sense.
For x = (a, φ) ∈ Wk with (cid:107)a(cid:107)L2

for all v ∈ Tj,x and j ≤ k. Therefore, these Sobolev norms will also be equivalent when
working over paths of three-dimensional conﬁgurations, and so even in the four-dimensional
setting, we are content to use ∇.
For x = (a, φ) ∈ Wk, we let J gC

x ⊂ T gC

be the (real) span of (0, iφ). This is the tangent

space to the S1-orbit at x. Since J gC

The intersection of a gauge orbit with global Coulomb gauge is depicted schematically in

Figure 1.

Proof. Let x = (a, φ) ∈ Wk−1. We recall from [KM07, Page 140] that

j,x =

j,x . If we write (b, ψ) = (−dζ, ζφ),
First, we compute Jj,x ∩ T gC
we have d∗dζ = 0. Since Y is a rational homology sphere, this implies that ζ is constant.

shown are the tangent spaces to the orbits, and the global Coulomb projec-

Therefore,

j,x = {(0, itφ) | t ∈ R} = J gC
x .
Now, we study (ΠgC∗ )x(Jj,x). Let (−dζ, ζφ) ∈ Jj,x. Recall that

Jj,x ∩ T gC

where ξ : Y → iR satisﬁes d∗(−dζ − dξ) = 0 and (cid:82)

(ΠgC∗ )x(−dζ, ζφ) = (−dζ − dξ, ζφ + ξφ),

Y ξ = 0. Again, since Y is a rational
homology sphere, this implies that ζ + ξ is a constant it for some t ∈ R. Therefore, we
obtain

This implies that (ΠgC∗ )x(Jj,x) = J gC

x , as desired.

(ΠgC∗ )x(−dζ, ζφ) = (0, itφ).

Analogous to the splitting of Tj as Jj ⊕ Kj, there exists a decomposition

We call KagC
j,x the anticircular global Coulomb slice at a point x = (a, φ) ∈ Wk. Observe
that, if d∗b = 0, then the vector (b, 0) is L2-perpendicular to all (−dζ, ζφ) ∈ Jj,x, and hence
lies in the local Coulomb slice Kj,x ⊂ Ke
j,x. Using the formula (37) for the ˜g-inner product,
we get that

(61)

(cid:104)(0, iφ), (b, 0)(cid:105)˜g = Re(cid:104)(0, iφ), ΠelC(b, 0)(cid:105)L2 = Re(cid:104)(0, iφ), (b, 0)(cid:105)L2 = 0.

We deduce that the condition (cid:104)(0, iφ), (b, ψ)(cid:105)˜g = 0 is equivalent to

(cid:104)(0, iφ), (0, ψ)(cid:105)˜g = 0.

is not orthogonal with respect to this L2 metric. Rather, on the irreducible locus, the
decomposition is orthogonal with respect to the pull-back of the L2 metric on C(Y ). On the
other hand, this pull-back does not produce a non-degenerate metric on the whole Cσ(Y ).
Now consider the residual gauge action of S1 on W . It is convenient to blow up W at

Note that the condition (b, r, ψ) ∈ T σ
j,x already implies that Re(cid:104)φ, ψ(cid:105)L2 = 0. Furthermore,
here and later, by (cid:104)ψ, iφ(cid:105)˜g we implicitly mean that the inner product is taken in the blow-
down projection; that is, we consider (cid:104)iφ, ψ(cid:105)˜g(a,sφ). It is useful to compare (cid:104)iφ, ψ(cid:105)˜g with the
result of taking the ˜g-inner product of (0, iφ) with the image of (b, r, ψ) in the blow-down:
(b, rφ + sψ). This yields

(cid:104)(b, rφ + sψ), (0, iφ)(cid:105)˜g = s(cid:104)(0, ψ), (0, iφ)(cid:105)˜g + r(cid:104)(0, φ), (0, iφ)(cid:105)˜g = s(cid:104)ψ, iφ(cid:105)˜g,
(71)
since (0, φ) ∈ K(a,sφ) and Re(cid:104)φ, iφ(cid:105)L2 = 0. Note that if we tried to deﬁne KagC,σ
(a,s,φ) using the
˜g-inner product of (0, iφ) with (b, rφ + sψ), we would not obtain a bundle, since this would
be larger at reducibles. On the other hand, for irreducibles, we have the following.
Lemma 5.4. At every irreducible x = (a, s, φ) ∈ W σ

k , the inﬁnitesimal blow-down projection

(b, r, ψ) (cid:55)→ (b, rφ + sψ)

From (72) we see that the anticircular global Coulomb slice is a true “inﬁnitesimal slice”

orbits. Another such complement is the local Coulomb slice in the blow-up, Kσ

Coulomb projection and anticircular global Coulomb projection are given by adding the
suitable elements in J σ

(c) The case s = 0 was studied in part (b). Therefore, it now suﬃces to consider the
case when s (cid:54)= 0, so that x is irreducible. Then, the local slices are isomorphic to the
corresponding ones in the blow-down, and the projections commute with the inﬁnitesimal
blow-down map, so we can simply work in the blow-down.
Let Φ = sφ and z = (a, Φ). We need to check that if we have a vector v ∈ Kj,z, then its
projection w = (ΠgC∗ )z(v) lands in the anticircular global Coulomb slice. In other words, we
know that Re(cid:104)(0, iΦ), v(cid:105)L2 = 0, and we want to check that (cid:104)(0, iΦ), w(cid:105)˜g = 0. Recall from
(35) that ΠelC
(w) = v. Using (37), we get

identity on) the inﬁnitesimal orbit space J σ
j,x.
5.2. Choices of gauge on cylinders. Let Z = I × Y be a cylinder. Recall that C(Z)
consists of pairs (a, φ) with a ∈ Ω1(Z; iR) and φ ∈ Γ(S+). We write such a pair as a path

j,x

(a(t) + α(t)dt, φ(t)),

t ∈ I,
where a(t) ∈ Ω1(Y ; iR), α(t) ∈ C∞(Y ; iR), and φ(t) ∈ Γ(S).
Recall that if α(t) = 0 we say that (a, φ) is in temporal gauge and that any conﬁguration
can be put into temporal gauge using the action of G(Z).
We seek an analogue of C(Z) adapted to global Coulomb gauge. The ﬁrst guess is to
consider W (Z), the subspace of C(Z) consisting of conﬁgurations in temporal gauge, and
that are also in (three-dimensional) Coulomb gauge at each slice {t} × Y ; that is,

W (Z) = {(a, φ) ∈ Γ(Z, p∗(iT ∗Y ⊕ S)) | a(t) ∈ ker d∗, ∀t},

where p : Z → Y denotes the projection. Note that an arbitrary conﬁguration (a, φ) ∈ C(Z)
cannot always be moved into W (Z) by a four-dimensional gauge transformation; instead,
we can move it into temporal gauge, and then Coulomb project in each three-dimensional
slice. Further, on W (Z) we could consider an action by the group of slicewise constant
gauge transformations

GgC(Z) = C∞(I; S1),
with u ∈ GgC(Z) acting by (a(t), φ(t)) → (a(t), u(t)φ(t)).

As we saw in Section 3.3, the global Coulomb projections of Seiberg-Witten trajectories

are the solutions of

dt

(a(t), φ(t)) = 0,

(80)
where (a, φ) ∈ W (Z).
Note that the equations (80) are invariant under the action of constant u ∈ S1, but not
under all of GgC(Z). This is similar to what happens in C(Z): the Seiberg-Witten equations
are invariant under the whole group G(Z), but once we move to temporal gauge and write
the equations as a gradient ﬂow, we are only left with the action of G(Y ), constant in t.

In view of this, a better analogue of C(Z) is deﬁned using the following notion:

Deﬁnition 5.8. A conﬁguration (a(t) + α(t)dt, φ(t)) ∈ Ω1(Z; iR) ⊕ Γ(S+) is said to be in
pseudo-temporal gauge if for each t, the component α(t) is constant as a function on Y .
We let CgC(Z) consist of pairs (a(t) + α(t)dt, φ(t)) in pseudo-temporal gauge, and such

that (a(t), φ(t)) is in slicewise Coulomb gauge, i.e.:

d(α(t)) = 0, d∗(a(t)) = 0, ∀t ∈ I.

The elements of GgC(Z) act on CgC(Z) as usual gauge transformations:

u :(cid:0)a(t) + α(t)dt, φ(t)(cid:1) (cid:55)→(cid:0)a(t) + (α(t) − u(t)−1 du(t)

)dt, u(t)φ(t)(cid:1).

dt

Consider the process of moving an arbitrary conﬁguration in C(Z) into pseudo-temporal
gauge by an element of G(Z), and then applying slicewise global Coulomb projection to
land in CgC(Z). Under this process, the Seiberg-Witten equations turn into:

(cid:16) d

+ X gC(cid:17)

dt

(a(t), φ(t)) + (0, α(t)φ(t)) = 0,

(81)
for (a(t)+α(t)dt, φ(t)) ∈ CgC(Z). These equations are invariant under the action of GgC(Z).
Of course, every solution of (81) can be transformed into a solution of (80) by moving into
temporal gauge. Most of the time we will work with solutions of (80), i.e., trajectories of
X gC. However, when considering inﬁnitesimal deformations of such trajectories (as we shall
do in Section 5.9, for example), it is important to allow the more general pseudo-temporal
gauge in order to obtain a good Fredholm problem.
By analogy with the section F : C(Z) → V(Z) from Section 4.1, we write F gC(a, φ) for
the left hand side of Equation (81). We view F gC as a section

F gC : CgC(Z) → V gC(Z),

where V gC(Z) is the trivial W (Z) bundle over CgC(Z).

It is worth comparing V gC(Z) to the bundle V(Z) from Section 4.1, whose ﬁbers were
+T ∗Z ⊕ S−). In our setting, we identify self-dual imaginary two-forms on Z with
Γ(Z; iΛ2
sections a = (a(t)) of p∗(iT ∗Y ), via sending a section a to ∗a + dt∧ a, where ∗ here denotes
the Hodge star operator on Y . We then impose a Coulomb gauge condition d∗a(t) = 0 for
all t. Further, the bundle S− can be identiﬁed with p∗S. Thus, the ﬁbers become W (Z), as
in our deﬁnition of V gC(Z).

5.3. Controlled Coulomb perturbations. In Section 4.2 we discussed how one can per-
turb the Seiberg-Witten equations by a formal gradient q. In Coulomb gauge, a perturbation
is an S1-equivariant vector ﬁeld

η : W → T gC

.

0

We write η0 and η1 for the connection and spinor components of η.
We are interested in perturbations η that are ˜g-formal gradients of functions f : W → R.
Given such an η, by applying it slicewise in t on a cylinder Z = I × Y , we obtain a section
(82)

ˆη : CgC(Z) → V gC(Z),

ˆη(a(t) + α(t)dt, φ(t)) = η(a(t), φ(t)).

We require that ˆη preserves Sobolev regularity. We will also need properties of η analogous
to some of the very tameness properties of q. (Compare Deﬁnitions 4.5 and 4.9.)

Deﬁnition 5.9. Suppose that η = (η0, η1) is the ˜g-formal gradient of an S1-equivariant
function f : W → R. Let ˆη be the induced four-dimensional perturbation. We say η is
a controlled Coulomb perturbation if for all integers k ≥ 2, and all compact cylinders

Remark 5.10. In [KM07], Properties (ii), (iv), (v), and (vi) in Deﬁnition 4.5 are used to
get bounds on the stationary points and trajectories of Xq. When we do ﬁnite-dimensional
approximation, we have a priori bounds since we restrict to the ball B(2R). Therefore,
there is no need to include analogues of these properties in Deﬁnition 5.9 above.

We recall that the inﬁnitesimal global Coulomb projection of the Seiberg-Witten vector
ﬁeld X = gradL is given by X gC = l + c, where l and c are deﬁned by (39) and (40)
respectively. Suppose that q is an abstract perturbation given by the formal gradient of a
function f . Let

(83)

ηq(a, φ) = (ΠgC∗ )(a,φ)q(a, φ)

projection of Xq = X + q is then

Proof. (a) Let (a, φ) ∈ Ck(Y ). By deﬁnition,

We are interested in showing that this expression has L2

, we need to check
We ﬁrst consider the case m = 1. Let (a, φ) ∈ Wk and (b, ψ) ∈ Wj. It is straightforward

functional boundedness. Precisely, to show that D(ΠgC∗ ◦ X) is in Cn−1
that Dm(ΠgC∗ ◦ X) is functionally bounded for all m = 1, . . . , n.

.
Since X and DX are functionally bounded (the latter as a map from Wk to Hom(Wj,Cj(Y ))),
we get bounds on X(a, φ) and D(a,φ)X 0(b, ψ) in terms of the L2
k norm of (a, φ) and the L2
j
norm of (b, ψ). To obtain the desired L2
j bounds on (84), as above, we apply the continuity
and bilinearity of the Sobolev multiplication L2

Finally, we give the argument for the second derivative (as this will illustrate the appro-
priate Sobolev norms) and allow the reader to complete the proof by induction. We consider
the derivative of D(ΠgC∗ ◦ X), which we think of as a map from Wk to Hom(Wk × Wj, Wj).
Again, let (a, φ) ∈ Wk, (b, ψ) ∈ Wj. We also denote an L2
k tangent vector to (a, φ) by (α, ζ).

Proof of Lemma 5.11. First, note that if q is the L2-formal gradient of f : C(Y ) → R, then
ηq is the ˜g-formal gradient of the restriction of f to W .

(c) Similar arguments apply to establish the four-dimensional analogues.

Since ηq(a, φ) = (ΠgC∗ )(a,φ)q(a, φ), the result follows by combining Lemmas 3.1 and 5.12

Proof of Proposition 5.14. If γ is a smooth trajectory of X σ
q , which is exactly X gC,σ
γ(cid:91) is a trajectory of ΠgC,σ∗
Conversely, given a trajectory γ of X gC,σ
, we can lift it to a smooth trajectory γ(cid:93) of
q as follows. Consider the submanifold O(γ)k ⊂ Cσ
X σ
k (Y ) consisting of all points that are
on the gauge orbits of points on γ. Thus, any x ∈ O(γ)k can be written as x = u · γ(t0)
where u is an L2
q (x) is in
the local Coulomb slice Kσ
x,k−1. Consider the push-forward (u−1)∗vx, which is in the local
Coulomb slice to u−1 · x = ΠgC(x). Now, u−1 · x is part of the trajectory γ, and hence
is smooth. Therefore, (u−1)∗vx = (X σ
k+1
gauge transformation u yields the vector v, which we now see that it must be in L2
k. Thus,
the vectors vx form a true vector ﬁeld on the Banach manifold O(γ)k. By integrating this
vector ﬁeld starting at a smooth point x ∈ O(γ)k, we obtain a lift γ(cid:93) of γ. We can do this
for any k, and obtain the same lift; hence, γ(cid:93) is smooth.
In the above construction, note that the lift γ(cid:93) is unique up to transformation by an
element in G. Indeed, in four-dimensions, after moving to temporal gauge, there are only
gauge transformations which are constant in t. (Compare [KM07, Proposition 7.2.1].) (cid:3)

called the Hessian (in the blow-up). The Hessian is needed in Floer theory for several
reasons. First, the non-degeneracy of a stationary point x is expressed in terms of the

q,x. Second, we need to study Hessians at all points (not necessarily
stationary) in order to construct the operator

(93)
which can be applied to vector ﬁelds along a path γ in Cσ(Y ). If γ is a ﬂow trajectory for X σ
q ,
then the surjectivity of d/dt+Hessσ
q indicates that the moduli space of trajectories is regular
at γ. Also, for arbitrary γ (not necessarily a ﬂow trajectory), we need the operator (93)
to describe the relative grading of stationary points, and to construct orientations on the
moduli spaces of trajectories.
We will do the same analysis in global Coulomb gauge. We will ﬁrst deﬁne a ˜g-Hessian
before the blow-up, at irreducible points (a, φ) (that is, those with φ (cid:54)= 0). We will then
construct a ˜g-Hessian on the blow-up, well-deﬁned at all points.

5.5.1. The Hessian at irreducibles. We start by recalling the original Hessian at irreducibles,
as deﬁned in Section 12.3 of [KM07]:

This formula applies to any x = (a, φ) ∈ Ck(Y ) with φ (cid:54)= 0.

60

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

Remark 5.16. When x is a stationary point, we can actually drop the projection ΠlC
x from
the formula for Hessq,x. This is because Xq is a formal gradient, so it is orthogonal to the
gauge orbits; therefore, it can be viewed as a section of Kk−1, and its derivative at a zero
point must automatically land in the local Coulomb slice.

The ˜g-Hessian is deﬁned as:

◦ D˜g

: KagC

k,x → KagC

Hess˜g

q,x = ΠagC

k−1,x.

(95)
Here, D˜g denotes the connection on T gC induced by the ˜g metric on Wk. To put this in
context, recall that the derivative of a vector ﬁeld is well-deﬁned at a stationary point x, but
when x is not stationary it depends on the choice of a connection in the tangent bundle. In
(94), we simply viewed the vector ﬁeld Xq as a map into aﬃne space, and took its derivative
as such. Doing the same thing in global Coulomb gauge would mean using the connection
D induced by the ordinary L2 metric. However, X gC
is the ˜g-gradient of (L + f )|W , and
taking its ordinary derivative DxX gC
q would yield an operator that is not symmetric. It is
more natural to use the connection D˜g, which is explicitly given by the formula:
(96)
Here, X is a vector ﬁeld on Wk, and ΠelC(X) is a section of Tk over Wk. We implicitly
k+1-invariant vector ﬁeld on the whole conﬁguration space Ck(Y );
extend ΠelC(X) to a G◦
this allows us to take its derivative in the direction ΠelC(Z), for some Z.

D˜g(X) = ΠgC∗ ◦ D(ΠelC(X)) ◦ ΠelC.

q

Let us check that the formula (96) produces a connection compatible with ˜g. If X, Y and

Z are vector ﬁelds on Wk, we have:
Z(cid:104)X, Y (cid:105)˜g = Z Re(cid:104)ΠelC(X), ΠelC(Y )(cid:105)L2

= ΠelC(Z) Re(cid:104)ΠelC(X), ΠelC(Y )(cid:105)L2
= Re(cid:104)(D(ΠelC(X)))(ΠelC(Z)), ΠelC(Y )(cid:105)L2 + (cid:104)ΠelC(X), (D(ΠelC(Y )))(ΠelC(Z))(cid:105)L2
= Re(cid:104)(D˜gX)(Z), ΠelC(Y )(cid:105)L2 + (cid:104)ΠelC(X), (D˜gY )(Z)(cid:105)L2
= Re(cid:104)ΠelC((D˜gX)(Z)), ΠelC(Y )(cid:105)L2 + (cid:104)ΠelC(X), ΠelC((D˜gY )(Z))(cid:105)L2
= Re(cid:104)(D˜gX)(Z), Y (cid:105)˜g + (cid:104)X, (D˜gY )(Z)(cid:105)˜g.

Here, we have implicitly extended ΠelC(X) and ΠelC(Y ) to G◦
the conﬁguration space. The second equality above is true because the function

k+1-invariant vector ﬁelds on

Re(cid:104)ΠelC(X), ΠelC(Y )(cid:105)L2

k+1-invariant, and therefore its derivative in the direction Z − ΠelC(Z) ∈ J ◦

is G◦
k vanishes.
For some of the other equalities, we used repeatedly the fact that the L2 inner product with
something in the enlarged local Coulomb slice is unchanged by applying either ΠgC∗ or ΠelC
to the other factor. This last fact is true because both of these operations consist in adding
a vector in J ◦
k , and such vectors are L2 perpendicular to the enlarged local Coulomb slice.

One can also check that the connection D˜g is torsion-free:
(D˜gX)(Y ) − (D˜gY )(X) = ΠgC∗ ◦ D(ΠelC(X))(ΠelC(Y )) − ΠgC∗ ◦ D(ΠelC(Y ))(ΠelC(X))

= ΠgC∗ [ΠelC(X), ΠelC(Y )]
= [X, Y ].

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

61

To see the last equality, it suﬃces to check how the respective vector ﬁelds act on G◦
k+1-
invariant functions on the conﬁguration space. On such functions f , the action of a vector
ﬁeld does not change if we apply ΠelC or ΠgC∗
to that vector ﬁeld (because this means
changing it by a vector ﬁeld in a direction tangent to G◦
k+1). The equality follows easily
from this observation.
Remark 5.17. It follows from the above discussion that D˜g is the exact analogue of the
Levi-Civita connection on the inﬁnite-dimensional manifold W with respect to the ˜g-metric.
Therefore, when we compute the ˜g-Hessian of a real-valued function on W , we will obtain
a symmetric operator.

From Section 3.2 we know that the projection ΠgC∗ maps Ke isomorphically onto T gC,
. From here, in view of

q = ΠgC∗ Xq, we also have Xq = ΠelCX gC

It is shown in [KM07, Proposition 12.3.1] that Hessq,x is a Fredholm operator of index

Lemma 5.19. For any x = (a, φ) ∈ Wk with φ (cid:54)= 0, the operator Hess˜g
q,x : KagC
is Fredholm of index zero. Therefore, it is surjective if and only if it is injective.

At this point it is helpful to recall the proof of [KM07, Proposition 12.3.1], which says
that Hessq,x is a Fredholm operator of index zero. That proof will serve as a model for some
of our later arguments.

We start by recalling [KM07, Deﬁnition 12.2.1]:

Deﬁnition 5.20. An operator L is called k-almost self-adjoint ﬁrst-order elliptic (k-ASAFOE)
if it is of the form

L = L0 + h

where

• L0 is a ﬁrst-order, self-adjoint, elliptic diﬀerential operator (with smooth coeﬃ-

cients) acting on sections of a vector bundle E → Y ;

• h : C∞(Y ; E) → L2(Y ; E) is a linear operator on sections of E that extends to a

bounded map on L2

j (Y ; E) for all j with |j| ≤ k.

62

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

For |j| ≤ k, note that a k-ASAFOE operator L0+h is Fredholm of index zero when viewed
j−1(Y ; E). Indeed, this statement is true for L0 (by ellipticity and

as a map L2
self-adjointness), and adding h is just a compact perturbation.

j (Y ; E) → L2

Note that Hessq,x is not k-ASAFOE, because it does not act on all sections of a vector

bundle. The remedy in [KM07] was to introduce an extended Hessian
k−1(Y ; iR)

(cid:100)Hessq,x : Tk,x ⊕ L2

Here, the hi terms preserve Sobolev regularity and hence are compact as maps L2

(As an aside, note also that the hi terms are zero at stationary points.) Thus, dropping
h1, h2 and h3 from the expression above yields a Fredholm operator of index 0. In turn,
since the hi are compact, this shows that Hessq,x must be Fredholm of index 0.

the condition Re(cid:104)φ, ψ(cid:105)L2 = 0. Nevertheless, we can combine the r and ψ components of
(b, r, ψ) ∈ T σ
and then we can think of (cid:100)Hess

q,x as acting on sections of iT ∗Y ⊕ S ⊕ iR. It then becomes a
k-ASAFOE operator (hence Fredholm of index zero), and starting from here one can show
that Hessσ
q,x is Fredholm of index zero—much as in the proof of Lemma 5.19. Further, when
x is a non-degenerate stationary point, Hessσ
q,x is invertible and has real spectrum (even
though it is not self-adjoint). See [KM07, Section 12.4] for details.
Let us now move to global Coulomb gauge. Fix x = (a, s, φ) ∈ W σ. In this setting, we

the diﬀerence is bounded from L2
First, consider β ∈ L2

Here we are using that Gd∗D(a,sφ)q0(b, rφ+sψ)φ is real L2 orthogonal to φ since q0 is purely

(ii) Hessq,x : Kk,x → Kk−1,x is surjective,

Proof. The equivalence (i) ⇐⇒ (ii) is proved in [KM07, Lemma 12.4.1]. It is a consequence

We can write γ as a path

γ(t) = (a(t) + α(t)dt, s(t), φ(t)).

Recall from Section 5.2 that the condition γ ∈ CgC,τ
k,loc (R × Y ) means that γ is in pseudo-
temporal gauge (α(t) is constant on each slice), and that the one-form component a(t)
is in the kernel of d∗, for all t. Moreover, since we are in the τ model, we must have

This sends Bτ
Proof. Let us ﬁrst check that [ΠgC,τ (γ)] does not depend on the choice of representative γ for
the class [γ]. Indeed, suppose we change γ by a four-dimensional gauge transformation of the
form u : Z → S1. If we ignore the α(t)dt component and write x(t) = (a(t), s(t), φ(t)), we
ﬁnd that u acts on each x(t) as the three-dimensional gauge transformation u(t) := u|{t}×Y .
Write u(t) = ef (t) with f (t) : Y → iR. Using (67) and the fact that Gd∗df = f − µY (f ), we
see that

ΠgC,σ(ef (t) · x(t)) = eµY (f (t))ΠgC,σ(x(t)).

From here we get

Π[gC],τ (ef · γ) = eµY (f ) · Π[gC],τ (γ),

where the gauge transformation ef on the left is a four-dimensional gauge transformation,
and eµY (f ) is the slicewise constant gauge transformation obtained by taking the average of
f in each slice. Thus, the class [ΠgC,τ (γ)] is unchanged.

The fact that slicewise application of ΠgC,σ preserves the four-dimensional L2

k condition
can be seen from the formula (67), together with the Sobolev multiplication rule on inﬁnite
cylinders [KM07, Theorem 13.2.2]. Further, averaging α(t) slicewise preserves the L2
k con-
dition by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Continuity of the map Π[gC],τ follows from similar
arguments.
Finally, since s(t) (and hence the condition s(t) ≥ 0) is preserved by global Coulomb
projection, we have that Bτ
(cid:3)

k ([x], [y]) is mapped to BgC,τ

([x], [y]).

Observe that the map (121) is surjective but not injective. For example, suppose we
have two conﬁgurations γ1 and γ2 that are in temporal gauge and that diﬀer in each slice
by a three-dimensional gauge transformation u : Y → S1 (non-constant in t). Then
Π[gC],τ ([γ1]) = Π[gC],τ ([γ2]), but γ1 and γ2 are typically not gauge equivalent as four-
dimensional conﬁgurations.

Now suppose that [x] and [y] are stationary points of X agC,σ

Proposition 5.36. Every trajectory of X agC,σ
on W σ/S1 (connecting two stationary points
x and y as in Deﬁnition 4.16) is actually in BgC,τ
([x], [y]). Further, the map Π[gC],τ produces

The extended Hessians at x and y are invertible by the non-degeneracy assumption;
moreover, if we had not used the blow-up, they would be self-adjoint and therefore have real

are no longer self-adjoint. Nevertheless, they have real spectrum by [KM07, Lemma 12.4.3].

To see that the operators considered during these two interpolations are Fredholm and

sians that appeared in Lemmas 5.28 and 5.29, and which were shown there to be invertible

We have now shown that Qγ and (cid:98)QgC

However, any such nonzero element increases exponentially at one of the ends of the cylinder

Recall that Proposition 5.36 guaranteed that the moduli spaces M ([x], [y]) and M agC([x], [y])

versely by F τ

q , then also M agC([x], [y]) is cut out smoothly and transversely by F gC,τ

.

q

So far we have only discussed the usual moduli spaces M ([x], [y]). Similar arguments
apply to the moduli spaces M red([x], [y]) between reducibles. The end result is that we can
identify them with the corresponding moduli spaces M agC,red([x], [y]) in Coulomb gauge,
and that regularity of the former implies regularity of the latter.

5.11. Gradings. From now on we will assume that we have chosen an admissible per-
turbation q, so that all the stationary points are non-degenerate, and the moduli spaces
M ([x], [y]) and M red([x], [y]) are regular.

Let x, y be stationary points in W σ. In view of Lemma 5.41, Proposition 5.42 and the

deﬁnition of relative gradings in Section 4.8, we have

(153)

where γ is any path from x to y (not necessarily a trajectory of X σ

Thus, the relative gradings can be calculated directly in Coulomb gauge.
Recall from (58) that the relative gradings of reducible stationary points of Xq with the
same connection component can be computed in terms of the spectrum of the operator
Dq,a; here, an eigenvector φ of Dq,a has eigenvalue given by the spinorial energy of (a, 0, φ).
It is thus natural to ask how this relates to the analogous setup in Coulomb gauge. The
following tells us that spinorial energy and “Coulomb gauge spinorial energy” are equal.

In light of Lemma 5.43, we do not deﬁne a separate spinorial energy in Coulomb gauge.
Consider x = (a, 0, φ) a reducible stationary point of X gC,σ

Let µ be the corresponding eigenvalue. Since x is necessarily a stationary point of X σ
as well, φ is an eigenvector of Dq,a and (a, 0) is a stationary point of Xq. In particular,
D(a,0)Xq(0, φ) is in Coulomb gauge, and thus

relevant operators are self-adjoint at stationary points.

Lemma 5.44. Fix a reducible stationary point (a, 0) of X gC

with (a, 0) in the blow-down and have grading in the interval [−N, N ] are precisely the
reducible stationary points with spinorial energy in the interval [−ω1, ω2].
Proof. This follows from (58) and (155).

5.12. The cut-down moduli spaces in Coulomb gauge. Recall that in Section 4.7,
the U -map on monopole Floer homology was deﬁned by intersecting the moduli spaces
M ([x], [y]) and M red([x], [y]) with the zero set Z of a transverse section ζ of a complex line
bundle Eσ over Bσ
k (Bp). The bundle Eσ was associated to the map Gk+1(Bp) → S1, u (cid:55)→
u(p), where p = (t, q) is a point in R × Y . Without loss of generality, let us assume that
t = 0.

We will need to modify this deﬁnition so that we can relate it to Coulomb gauge. First,
whereas in Section 4.7 we followed [KMOS07] and used the restriction of conﬁgurations to
a standard ball Bp around p, we could just as well restrict to any closed neighborhood Np
of p that is a manifold with boundary. It is convenient to take Np = [−1, 1] × Y . Consider
the restriction r : Bk(Np) → Bk(Bp). On the blow-up, this induces a map

rσ : N → Bσ

k (Bp),

(cid:1),

well-deﬁned on the open subset N ⊂ Bσ
k (Np) consisting of conﬁgurations (a, s, φ) such
that φ does not vanish identically on Bp. Note that, because of the unique continuation
principle, the moduli spaces M ([x], [y]) and M red([x], [y]) are contained in N . (Here, we
identify trajectories with their restrictions to Np, again using unique continuation.)

Let us pull back ζ under rσ and obtain a section (rσ)∗ζ of the bundle

(Eσ)(cid:48) := (rσ)∗Eσ

over N . Intersecting the moduli spaces with the zero set of (rσ)∗ζ is the same as intersecting
them with Z . Furthermore, we can consider any other transverse section of (Eσ)(cid:48), and
let Z (cid:48) be its zero set.
If we deﬁne the U -maps using intersections with Z (cid:48), standard
continuation arguments in Floer theory show that they are chain homotopic to the original
ones.
Note that (Eσ)(cid:48) is associated to the map Gk+1(Np) → S1, u (cid:55)→ u(0, q). For our next
modiﬁcation, let (Eσ)(cid:48)(cid:48) be the complex line bundle over N ⊂ Bσ
k (Np) associated to the
map

(156)
where f : Np → iR and µY (f (0,·)) is the average value of f on the slice {0} × Y .

We can construct a family of bundles interpolating between (Eσ)(cid:48) and (Eσ)(cid:48)(cid:48), by consid-

Gk+1(Np) → S1, ef (cid:55)→ eµY (f (0,·)),

ering the maps

Gk+1(Np) → S1, ef (cid:55)→ eλµY (f (0,·))+(1−λ)f (0,q).

Thus, instead of considering sections of (Eσ)(cid:48), we could deﬁne the U -maps using sections
of (Eσ)(cid:48)(cid:48), and the results will be chain homotopic to the originals.

The third modiﬁcation consists in moving from the σ model to the τ model. As explained
in [KM07, Section 6.3], the two models are equivalent in the following sense. Consider the
k (Np) consisting of conﬁgurations (a, s, φ) with φ|{t}×Y (cid:54)≡ 0 for all
open subset U ⊂ Bσ
t ∈ [0, 1]. As noted in [KM07, p.463], there is a natural map

 : U → Bτ

k (Np).

There is a complex line bundle Eτ over Bτ

By unique continuation, the moduli spaces M ([x], [y]) and M red([x], [y]) restricted to Np
yield conﬁgurations in U , which map homeomorphically onto their image under .
k (Np) associated to the same map (156) as
before. When we pull it back under  and then further restrict to U ∩ N , we obtain the
restriction of the bundle (Eσ)(cid:48)(cid:48) to U ∩ N . Thus, we can equivalently deﬁne the U -maps
using the τ model and intersecting with the zero set Z τ of a transverse section of Eτ .

We are now ready to make the connection with conﬁgurations in Coulomb gauge. This
is done via the global Coulomb projection Π[gC],τ . In (121) the map Π[gC],τ was deﬁned for
conﬁgurations on R× Y with ﬁxed asymptotics, but the same formula (120) can be applied
to a conﬁguration on Np = [−1, 1] × Y . By a slight abuse of notation, we still write Π[gC],τ

EagC,τ over BgC,τ
(Np), pulled back from EagC,σ under the map (157). From ζ agC we obtain
a section of EagC,τ , and intersections of its zero set with the moduli spaces correspond to
intersections of Z agC with those moduli spaces.

Observe that the pull-back of EagC,τ under Π[gC],τ is exactly the bundle Eτ over Bτ

k (Np).
Thus, we can pull back the section of EagC,τ and obtain a section of Eτ , which we can then
take to be the one deﬁning the U -maps in the τ model. We have a commutative diagram:

where the horizontal maps are given by restriction, and are one-to-one (by unique continu-

phism, we obtain an identiﬁcation of the cut-down moduli spaces:

oriented using an orientation data set. That discussion can be adapted to global Coulomb
gauge. To orient the spaces M agC([x], [y]), we need to trivialize the determinant lines

[x],[y] · ogC

[y],[z] = ogC

[x],[z].

An orientation data set in Coulomb gauge produces orientations on the moduli spaces
M agC([x], [y]) and M agC,red([x], [y]).

Proposition 5.45. An orientation data set o (as in Section 4.6) naturally induces an
orientation data set ogC in Coulomb gauge, such that the homeomorphisms constructed in
Proposition 5.36,

M ([x], [y])

∼=−→ M agC([x], [y]),

are orientation-preserving, and so are the homeomorphisms

M red([x], [y])

∼=−→ M agC,red([x], [y]).

Proof. Fix an orientation data set o. This trivializes the determinant lines det(Pγ), for the
operators Pγ from (51). Let us focus on trajectories γ ∈ W τ (I × Y ). We seek to trivialize
the corresponding operators P gC
γ , we follow the steps in the
proof of Proposition 5.40, but considering operators deﬁned on compact cylinders, and with
spectral projections added at the boundary. Speciﬁcally, we can deform Pγ into an operator

γ ). The resulting trivializations are compatible with concatenation,

and then one of det(P gC

The fact that the homeomorphisms are orientation-preserving is immediate from the
(cid:3)

construction.

Observe that Proposition 5.45 also implies that the identiﬁcations (158) and (159), be-

tween the cut-down moduli spaces, are orientation-preserving.

since the original generators are non-degenerate, so are the ones in Coulomb gauge, in the
sense that ker(Dσ

6. Finite-dimensional approximations with tame perturbations

6.1. Very compactness. Since monopole Floer homology is deﬁned using a perturbation
q, we must deﬁne an analogue of the Floer spectrum using this perturbation as well. In
order to do this, we must recall a more general setting in which the spectrum can be deﬁned.
Deﬁnition 6.1. A smooth map η : W → W is called very compact if for all integers k ≥ 5
and compact cylinders Z = I × Y , the following two conditions are satisﬁed:
(a) The map η induces a continuous, functionally bounded map

ˆη : Wk−1(Z) → Wk−1(Z), and

W × m(cid:89)
W → W, (x; v1, . . . , vm) → (Dmη)x(v1, . . . , vm)
Wk(Z) × Wk−1−i1(Z) × . . . × Wk−1−im(Z) → Wk−1−(cid:80) is(Z).

i=1

(b) We can extend the diﬀerentials

to continuous maps

By the argument mentioned in Remark 4.6 (that is, working with conﬁgurations which
are constant in the R direction), we obtain the analogous regularity statements on Y as
well. We call such a map η very compact because condition (a), applied with k instead of
k− 1, guarantees that the induced map η : Wk → Wk is functionally bounded, and therefore
η : Wk → Wk−1 is compact (in the sense that it takes bounded sets to precompact sets).

One example of a very compact map is the map c : W → W from (40).

Proposition 6.2. Let η : W → W be a very compact map. Fix k ≥ 5. Suppose that there
exists a closed, bounded subset N of Wk such that the ﬁnite type trajectories of l + η on Wk
that are contained in N are actually contained in W ∩ U for an open set U ⊂ N . Then:
(i) For λ (cid:29) 0, trajectories of l + pλη contained in N must be contained in U .
(ii) We can deﬁne the Floer spectrum Σ−W (−λ,0)I λ as in (3). This is independent of λ up
to stable equivalence.
(iii) Furthermore, if η is S1-equivariant, then the Floer spectrum can be constructed equiv-
ariantly, and is an invariant up to S1-equivariant stable equivalence.

We omit the proof of Proposition 6.2, as it is analogous to that of [Man03, Theorem
1]. In particular, part (i) corresponds to [Man03, Proposition 3]. The results in [Man03]
were for the special case where η = c, N = B(2R), and U = B(R), as in Section 3. The
properties of c used in those proofs were exactly those listed in Deﬁnition 6.1.

Remark 6.3. Very compactness was deﬁned in [Man07, Deﬁnition 4]. There, condition (a)
only required that η : Wk → Wk−1 be a compact map. Proposition 5 in [Man07] claimed
that Proposition 6.2 is true under this weaker hypothesis. However, this is in fact not
suﬃcient. In [Man03], Step 1 in the proof of Proposition 3 requires functional boundedness
of η to bound the derivatives of trajectories, and Step 3 requires continuity of ˆη in order to
do elliptic bootstrapping on I × Y .

For future reference, we state a key lemma that is needed for the proof of Proposi-

tion 6.2(i). Its analogue is contained in the proof of Proposition 3 in [Man03].
Lemma 6.4. Let I ⊆ R be a closed interval (possibly R). Under the hypotheses of Proposi-
tion 6.2, suppose we have a sequence of eigenvalues λn → ∞ and a sequence of trajectories

90

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

γn : I → W of l + pλnη, such that γn(t) ∈ N for all t ∈ I. Then there exists a subsequence
of γn for which the restrictions to any compact subinterval12 I(cid:48) (cid:98) I converge in the C∞
topology of W (I(cid:48) × Y ) to a trajectory of l + η.

The following will allow us to deﬁne a Floer spectrum which incorporates the perturba-

tions used in deﬁning monopole Floer homology.
Proposition 6.5. Let q be a very tame perturbation. Then the map ηq = ΠgC∗ q : W → W
from (83) is very compact.

Proof. Recall from Lemma 5.11 that ηq is a controlled perturbation, in the sense of Deﬁni-
tion 5.9.
Thus, to prove Property (a) in the deﬁnition of very compactness, we simply apply part
(i) of Deﬁnition 5.9, with k − 1 instead of k. This says that ηq extends to a continuous,
functionally bounded map from Wk−1(Z) to Wk−1(Z).

For Property (b), without loss of generality, assume that im is the largest of the integers is.
Let us study the regularity properties of the derivatives of q. We apply [KM07, Proposition
11.4.1(ii)], which states that for p ≥ 2, the map

Dmˆq : (x, v1, . . . , vm) (cid:55)→ Dm

x ˆq(v1, . . . , vm),

extends to a continuous map from Cp(Z) × . . . × Cp(Z) × Cj(Z) to Cj(Z), for 0 ≤ j ≤ p.
For clarity, this product is written to be compatible with the formula above, so the copy
of Cj(Z) in the domain consists of tangent vectors and the left-most Cp(Z) consists of the
point where we are computing the higher derivative. We let j = k − 1 − im and

Note that since k − 1 ≥ 4, k − 1 −(cid:80) is ≥ 0, and im = max is, we have that k − 1 − is ≥ 2

if m = 1,
if m ≥ 2.

k − 1
k − 1 − max{is | s (cid:54)= m}

(cid:40)

p =

for any s (cid:54)= m, so p ≥ 2. Thus,

Dmˆq : Cp(Z) × . . . × Cp(Z) × Ck−1−im(Z) → Ck−1−im(Z)

is continuous. By pre-composing with the continuous inclusions of Ck(Z) and Ck−1−is(Z)
into Cp(Z) for s (cid:54)= m and post-composing with the continuous inclusion of Ck−1−im(Z) into
Ck−1−(cid:80) is(Z), we get that Dmˆq extends to a map
The requirement (b) in the deﬁnition of very compactness now follows from Lemma 3.1. (cid:3)

Ck(Z) × Ck−1−i1(Z) × . . . × Ck−1−im(Z) → Ck−1−(cid:80) is(Z).

We want to apply Proposition 6.2 to l and

cq := c + ηq.

Since both of the terms c and ηq are very compact, so is cq. However, observe that very
compactness is only one of the requirements needed to do ﬁnite dimensional approximation.
The others are smoothness and boundedness for ﬂow trajectories, as in the statement of
Proposition 6.2. (The containment in W ∩U ⊂ W in the statement guarantees smoothness.)
In our setting, we know from [KM07, Proposition 13.1.2 (i)] that for a tame perturbation,
the perturbed Seiberg-Witten trajectories, and thus their global Coulomb projections, are
smooth. With regard to boundedness, in Proposition 6.2, we want to take U to be the open
ball of some radius R (cid:29) 0 in Wk, and N to be the closed ball of radius 2R. This is exactly

12For closed intervals I, I(cid:48) ⊆ R, we write I(cid:48) (cid:98) I if I(cid:48) is compact and contained in the interior of I.

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

what was done for the unperturbed Seiberg-Witten trajectories in [Man03]. It follows from
Proposition 1 of that paper that Seiberg-Witten trajectories inside B(2R) live inside B(R),
provided R was chosen large enough. The same proof works for perturbed Seiberg-Witten
trajectories, since they satisfy similar compactness properties, as detailed in [KM07, Section
10.7].

Therefore, we are now able to deﬁne an analogue of the Floer spectrum with the ﬁnite-
dimensional approximations of l + cq instead of l + c. We will denote this new spectrum by
SWFq(Y, s).

Proposition 6.6. Let q be a very tame perturbation. Then SWFq(Y, s) and SWF(Y, s) are
S1-equivariantly stably homotopy equivalent.

Proof. This is similar to the proof that SWF(Y, s) is independent of the Riemannian metric
on Y ; see [Man03, Section 7]. The key ingredients are the fact that we can interpolate
linearly between q and 0 such that the hypotheses of Proposition 6.2 are satisﬁed, and the
(cid:3)
fact that the homotopy type of the Conley index is invariant under perturbations.

Remark 6.7. It is worth comparing very compactness with the condition of being controlled,
If q is very tame, both of these conditions are satisﬁed by ηq; see
as in Deﬁnition 5.9.
Lemma 5.11 and Proposition 6.5. There is some overlap between the two conditions: for
example, part (a) in the deﬁnition of very compactness is implied by part (i) in the deﬁnition
of a controlled perturbation. However, neither condition is stronger than the other: part
(b) in the deﬁnition of very compactness has no analog in the controlled condition; and part
(ii) in the controlled condition has no analogue in very compactness due to the constraints
on functional boundedness.

When working with the perturbation ηq, we will need to use both very compactness and
the controlled condition. Very compactness is needed to do ﬁnite dimensional approxi-
mation, and the controlled compactness is necessary to study the properties of stationary
points and trajectories in these approximations.

From now on, we always assume that our perturbation q is both very tame (Deﬁnition 4.9)

and admissible (Deﬁnition 4.19). For the existence of such q, see Sections 4.4 and 4.5.

6.2. Strategy for the proof of Theorem 1.1. In order to relate monopole Floer ho-
mology to the spectrum, it suﬃces to instead work with SWFq(Y, s) by Proposition 6.6.
This latter invariant is clearly closer to monopole Floer homology due to the presence of
the perturbation. However, we still need to relate the vector ﬁeld l + cq used for monopole
Floer homology to l + pλcq on W λ . We will consider a vector ﬁeld on Wk deﬁned by taking
ﬁnite-dimensional approximations of the non-linear part of Xq:
(161)

on the blow-up W σ and thus a vector ﬁeld X agC,σ

At this point we give an outline of how the proof of Theorem 1.1 is going to go.
For N > 0, let C[−N,N ] be the set of stationary points of X agC,σ

of grading in [−N, N ].
Their S1-orbits form sets of stationary points of X gC,σ
on W σ. Let O[−N,N ] denote the
union of these orbits. We ﬁx N suﬃciently large so that the projection of O[−N,N ] to
the blow-down W contains all the stationary points of X gC
; in particular, C[−N,N ] should

contain all the irreducibles. Further, we assume that no reducible stationary point that is
boundary-stable has grading less than −N . This ensures that the truncated chain complex

}CM ≤N (Y, s, q) is generated by C[−N,N ]. Note that the homology of }CM ≤N (Y, s, q) agrees
with }HM (Y, s, q) in degrees ≤ N − 1.

stationary points of X agC,σ
that live in N /S1 (and hence in U/S1); in particular, this in-
cludes all irreducibles [(a, s, φ)] such that (a, sφ) ∈ B(2R). We will see that these stationary
points will necessarily be contained in the ﬁnite dimensional approximation (W λ)σ/S1. The
diﬀerential on ˇCλ will be deﬁned analogously to monopole Floer homology (only counting
trajectories that are contained entirely in (W λ)σ/S1). That this will actually be a chain
complex will come from a Morse-Smale stability condition—since we have non-degeneracy
of the stationary points and regularity of the moduli spaces for X agC,σ
, we will show that
this holds for X agC,σ
as well, provided that λ is suﬃciently large. Using the inverse function
theorem, we will ﬁnd a correspondence between the stationary points and isolated trajecto-
ries of X agC,σ
on the other. This will give an explicit

identiﬁcation between ˇCλ and }CM ≤N (Y, s, q). Here we are using the work of Section 5,

}HM ≤N−1(Y, s, q) ∼= (cid:101)H S1≤N−1(SWFq(Y, s)).

By letting N tend to inﬁnity and applying Proposition 6.6, we obtain the desired isomor-
phism in Theorem 1.1.

With the above strategy in mind, it will suﬃce to do most of our analysis (i.e. compact-
ness and non-degeneracy of stationary points and trajectories) in W σ rather than in the
quotient W σ/S1. We are able to do so due to the compactness of the residual gauge group
S1.

6.3. Finite-dimensional approximations of perturbations. In order to carry out the
strategy mentioned above, we need to understand the properties of the perturbation

and in particular of the term pληq. For notation, given a sequence λn → ∞, we write πn
for pλn. Recall that Θj is a constant such that (cid:107)pλx(cid:107)L2
for all x ∈ Wj and we
take Θ0 = 1.
Fact 6.8. (a) For all λ, the smoothed projection pλ extends to a continuous, linear map
pλ : Wj → Wj such that (cid:107)pλ(cid:107) ≤ Θj for all j. (Here, (cid:107)pλ(cid:107) denotes the norm of pλ as an
operator on Wj.)

Lemma 6.9. If q is a very tame perturbation, then pληq is a controlled Coulomb perturba-
tion for all λ.
Proof. Lemma 5.11 says that ηq is controlled. The claim now follows from Fact 6.8(a). (cid:3)
Lemma 6.10. The maps cq, pληq, pλcq and ηλ
Proof. This follows from the very compactness of c, together with the very compactness of

ηq (cf. Proposition 6.5), and Fact 6.8(a).

q are all very compact.

We also need the following result about cq, which is not subsumed in very compactness.

Lemma 6.11. Let Z = I × Y for compact I. For k ≥ 3 and 0 ≤ j ≤ k, the map

Dcq : Wk(Z) → Hom(Wj(Z), Wj(Z))

Proof. We write cq = c + ηq. Since ηq is a controlled Coulomb perturbation by Lemma 5.11,
we have that Dηq ∈ C∞
fb (Wk(Z), Hom(Wj(Z), Wj(Z))). Therefore, it suﬃces to show that
Dc is in C∞

fb as well. Write x = (a, φ).

By (40), we see that c is the composition of ΠgC∗ with the vector ﬁeld

(164)

X : Wk(Z) → Ck(Z), (a, φ) (cid:55)→ (τ (φ, φ), ρ(a) · φ).

We can explicitly compute

(D(a,φ)X)(b, ψ) = (τ (φ, ψ) + τ (ψ, φ), ρ(b) · φ + ρ(a) · ψ)
(a,φ)X)((α, ζ), (b, ψ)) = (τ (ζ, ψ) + τ (ψ, ζ), ρ(b) · ζ + ρ(α) · ψ)

In order to make further connection with the ﬁnite-dimensional setting of the spectrum,
we must ensure that the trajectories of X gC,σ
are actually contained in the ﬁnite-dimensional
blow-up of W λ, assuming control over the λ-spinorial energy. We begin with the non-blown-
up case.
Lemma 6.14. If γ(t) is a trajectory of X gC
W λ. In particular, γ(t) is smooth for each t.
Proof. Let γ(t) = (a(t), φ(t)). Fix κ with |κ| ≥ λ and let γκ(t) be the L2 projection of γ(t)
to the κ-eigenspace of l. It suﬃces to show that γκ(t) = 0. Since γ(t) is a trajectory of
X gC,τ

qλ contained in B(2R), then γ(t) is contained in

γ(t) = l(γ(t)) + (pλcq)(γ(t)).

Since |κ| ≥ λ, we see − d
dt γκ(t) = l(γκ(t)) = κγκ(t). Thus, γκ(t) = e−κtγκ(0). Suppose
that γκ(t) (cid:54)≡ 0. Therefore, γκ(t), and thus γ(t), are unbounded in the L2
k-norm on Y as
|t| increases. This contradicts γ(t) ∈ B(2R) for all t. Therefore, γκ(t) ≡ 0 and γ(t) is
(cid:3)
contained in W λ.

We seek an analogous result to Lemma 6.14, but in the blow-up. Apart from the 2R bound
on the projections of trajectories in the blow-down, we will also need to assume a bound ω
on the absolute values of spinorial energies Λq. With N , N and U as in Section 6.2, note
that Λq is bounded on the compact set O[−N,N ], and hence it is bounded on its neighborhood
N . The boundedness can be explained as follows. Since q is controlled and our choice of
k guarantees that k − 1 ≥ 2, we have that Λq is continuous on W σ
k−1. Therefore, Λq is
bounded on N since it is a compact subset of W σ
k−1. We shall choose ω > 0 so that any
point x ∈ N has

|Λq(x)| < ω.

Lemma 6.15. For suﬃciently large λ, the following is true. If γ(t) = (a(t), s(t), φ(t)) is a
trajectory of X gC,σ
contained in B(2R)σ and the λ-spinorial energy of γ(t) is in [−ω, ω] for
all t, then (a(t), φ(t)) ∈ W λ for all t ∈ R. In particular, (a(t), φ(t)) is smooth for all t ∈ R.
Proof. Fix λ (cid:29) ω. Fix κ with |κ| ≥ λ and let (aκ(t), φκ(t)) be the projection of (a(t), φ(t))
to the κ-eigenspace of l. Since (a(t), s(t)φ(t)) is contained in W λ by Lemma 6.14, we have
that aκ(t) ≡ 0. It suﬃces to show that φκ(t) ≡ 0. Let ν(t) = Λqλ(a(t), s(t), φ(t)). Since

λn → ∞. Then, there is a subsequence that converges in Wk to x, a stationary point for

k-bounded, we can extract a subsequence that converges
k−1. Further, after passing to another subsequence, we can assume

to some x = (a, s, φ) in L2
the xn are either all reducible or all irreducible.
First, suppose the xn are reducible, that is, sn = 0. By Lemma 7.1, the convergence
an → a is in the stronger L2
k norm. Moreover, a ∈ (ker d∗)k is such that (a, 0) is a stationary
point of X gC
. Recall that φn are eigenvectors for Dqλn ,an with L2-norm equal to 1. We
claim that φ is an eigenvector of Dq,a = D + D(a,0)(cq)1(0,·), and that the convergence
φn → φ is also in L2
k.
Let κn be the associated eigenvalues for φn, i.e., the λn-spinorial energies of xn. Since
k−1, by Lemma 6.12 (c) we have |Λq(x)| ≤ ω. By applying Lemma 6.12 (c)
xn → x in L2
again, this time to the λn-spinorial energies of xn, we see that Λqλn (xn) → Λq(x). Therefore,
we also have a bound ω(cid:48) ≥ ω on |Λqλn (xn)| = |κn|. After passing to a subsequence, we can
assume that the κn converge to some value κ. Then, we have

compactness of cq guarantees that D(an,0)cq(0, φn) converges to D(a,0)cq(0, φ) in L2
πn → 1 in the strong operator topology on Wk−1, we must also have

This correspondence preserves the type of stationary point (irreducible, stable, unstable).

It turns out we also can obtain analogous results for reducible stationary points in the

(B(2R) ∩ W λ)σ, but not in N ; see Proposition 9.10 below.

xλ is -close to x.
Proof. It is straightforward to verify that since the stationary points of X agC,σ
are non-
degenerate, so are the reducible stationary points of X gC
q when restricting to the reducible
locus in Wk. By the implicit function theorem, as used in the proof of Proposition 7.7,
we obtain that near each reducible stationary point x∞ of X gC

reducible stationary point xλ of X gC

is no need to blow-up or quotient by S1.) On the other hand, by Lemma 7.1, reducible

Observe that D, (pλ)1 and D(a,0)cq(0,·) are all L2 self-adjoint maps on spinors. (We are
using here that the ˜g metric agrees with the L2 metric at reducibles.) Nevertheless, the
product of (pλ)1 and D(a,0)cq(0,·), and hence the operator Dqλ,a, may not be self-adjoint.

of tame perturbations q, the reducible stationary points of Xq are non-degenerate. The key
point is in the proof of Lemma 12.6.2 in [KM07]: There is a large enough space of tame (in
fact, very tame) perturbations q⊥ (given by cylinder functions) that vanish at the reducible
locus, such that in the tangent space to any q⊥ we can ﬁnd a δq⊥ = grad δf , such that the

range [−N, N ]. Indeed, we will show that all the other reducible points in (B(2R) ∩ W λ)σ
cannot be in this grading range; see Proposition 9.10 below. Before we can discuss and
deﬁne gradings on stationary points as in Section 2, we must ﬁrst establish that X gC

indeed a Morse quasi-gradient. This is the subject of the following section. We return to

However, the maps pλ are deﬁned in terms of projections with respect to the usual L2

on W λ is neither the L2 nor the ˜g gradient of the restriction of Lq to W λ. In fact, there is
no reason for the derivative of X gC
qλ at stationary points to have real spectrum (as it would
happen for a gradient vector ﬁeld, with respect to any metric).

Nevertheless, in this section we will be able to prove the following.

Proposition 8.1. We can choose the admissible perturbation q such that for all λ = λ•

As discussed in Section 2, having a Morse-Smale equivariant quasi-gradient suﬃces in
order to construct (equivariant) Morse homology; the ﬁrst step towards this is establish-
ing the Morse condition (cf. Deﬁnition 2.18). The additional Morse-Smale condition on
trajectories will be shown in Section 10.

In view of Lemma 2.19, to check that X gC

qλ is a Morse equivariant quasi-gradient we need

three things:

• that the stationary points of X gC,σ
• that the operators DxX gC
• part (d) of Deﬁnition 2.18.

qλ at reducible stationary points x are self-adjoint;

Hyperbolicity of the stationary points was already checked in Proposition 7.11. Self-

qλ = l + pλDxcq at reducibles follows from the fact that

adjointness of the operators DxX gC
the metrics ˜g and L2 coincide there.

We are left to verify part (d) of Deﬁnition 2.18. Sections 8.1-8.6 below are devoted to

proving this.
Proposition 8.2. For each λ (cid:29) 0, there exists a smooth function

(cid:107)(b, ψ)(cid:107)˜g(x) ≤ (cid:107)(b, ψ)(cid:107)L2 + (cid:107)(dζ, ζφ)(cid:107)L2.

We claim that the right hand side is bounded by a constant times (cid:107)(b, ψ)(cid:107)L2. This follows
1 control on ζ from Lemma 8.8 and the fact that the condition x ∈ B(2R) gives
by the L2
L2
k (and hence C0) bounds on φ.
To prove the ﬁrst inequality, note that if we view ΠelC

as an isomorphism from the global
Coulomb slice to the extended local Coulomb slice, then its inverse is the inﬁnitesimal global
Coulomb projection, (ΠgC∗ )x, from (24). Thus, if we switch notation and now let (b, ψ) be
a vector in the extended local Coulomb slice, the ﬁrst inequality in (189) can be re-written
as

x

(cid:107)(ΠgC∗ )x(b, ψ)(cid:107)L2 ≤ C0 · (cid:107)(b, ψ)(cid:107)L2.

This holds by Lemma 5.12.

(cid:3)

Our next goal is to compare the L2- to ˜g-orthogonal projections from W to W λ. Since
i , we have that pλ is the L2-orthogonal projection to W λ, and we write

λ is of the form λ•

˜g(x) for the ˜g(x)-orthogonal projection to W λ. (Compare Remark 3.4.)
Proposition 8.10. There is a constant C1 > 0 such that, for all x ∈ B(2R) ⊂ Wk, we

˜g(x) and pλ are viewed as operators from the L2 completion W0 of W to itself.

where C1 is independent of x, v, and λ.
First, if v ∈ W λ, then note that pλ

0 . Thus, we would like to bound
(cid:107)pλ

˜g(x)(v) − pλ(v)(cid:107)L2 = (cid:107)pλ

˜g(x)(v)(cid:107)L2.

˜g(x)(v) = pλ(v) and the claim is trivial. Therefore, we

We write x = (a, φ) and

w = pλ

˜g(x)(v) ∈ W λ.

Recall from Proposition 8.9 that there exists a constant C0, independent of x, such that
(cid:107)v(cid:107)L2 ≤ C0(cid:107)v(cid:107)˜g(x) and similarly for w. In this case, we have that

Therefore, to obtain the desired bounds in the proposition, it suﬃces to prove that there
exists a constant K0 > 0, independent of x ∈ B(2R) and v ∈ (W λ)⊥

We now focus on proving this inequality.
For notation, let v = (b, ψ) and w = (b(cid:48), ψ(cid:48)). We write ΠelC
x (w) = (b(cid:48) − dζ(cid:48), ψ(cid:48) + ζ(cid:48)φ). Since w = pλ

where the third equality comes from the fact that d∗b = d∗b(cid:48) = 0. Let us now collect the
relevant bounds on ζ and ζ(cid:48). By Lemma 8.11, we have that (cid:107)ζ(cid:107)L2 and (cid:107)dζ(cid:107)L2 are bounded

To establish (191), it remains to bound the other three terms in (193).

Since x ∈ B(2R) ⊂ Wk, we have a uniform bound on (cid:107)φ(cid:107)C0 independent of x, denoted

K2. Therefore, using a similar argument as for (194), we obtain bounds

|(cid:104)ζφ, ψ(cid:48)(cid:105)L2| ≤ C2 · K2

cq(yn) → Dx∞cq(y) in L2.

We see that l(yn) converges in L2. Because the L2−1 limit of l(yn) is l(y), we in fact have
that l(yn) converges to l(y) in L2 and thus yn → y in L2
1, and y (cid:54)= 0. However, since
cq)(yn) converges to 0, we see that (l + Dx∞cq)(y) = 0. Bootstrapping further
(l + pλnDxλn
shows that y is actually an element of Wk.
First, suppose that x∞ is reducible. In this case, we have contradicted the non-degeneracy
of x∞, as l + Dx∞cq : Wk → Wk−1 is invertible (where we are using non-degeneracy in the
blow-down). Now, suppose that x∞ is an irreducible stationary point of X gC
. In this case,
we can only say that l + Dx∞cq is injective on the ˜g(x∞)-orthogonal complement of the
S1 orbit of x∞. Thus, we have that y must have some component tangent to the S1 orbit
of xλ, i.e., a multiple of (0, iφ∞). Because Re(cid:104)yn, (0, iφλn)(cid:105)L2 = 0 for all n, we see that
Re(cid:104)y, (0, iφ∞)(cid:105)L2 = 0 as well. This is a contradiction.

have that y is orthogonal to the S1 orbit of xλ. Since xλ is a stationary point, we have
(l + pλcq)(xλ) = 0. Therefore, the diﬀerence between (l + pλcq)(y) and (l + pλDxλcq)(x) is

Lemma 8.17. For λ (cid:29) 0, the inequality (207) holds.
Proof. Using Lemma 8.15 and the deﬁnition of Sλ in (203), it suﬃces to prove that for

(211)

By the deﬁnition of (cid:101)Sλ, we see that
Recall from (184), |(Dxωλ)(v)| ≤ C(cid:48)(cid:107)v(cid:107)L2, for a constant C(cid:48) independent of x ∈ B(2R).
Combining this inequality with Lemma 8.15, we have

(Dxωλ)(l + pλcq(x)) = (Dxωλ)(cid:0)(l + pλDxλcq)(y) +(cid:101)Sλ(y)(cid:1).

(cid:107)(l + pλDxλcq)(y)(cid:107)L2.

From Proposition 8.2, together with the equivalence between the ˜g and L2 metrics (Propo-

We have shown that X gC

nition 2.18 (on a non-compact manifold, as discussed in Section 2.8). Lemma 2.22 implies
the following:
Corollary 8.19. Let γ : R → W λ ∩ B(2R) be a ﬂow line of X gC
qλ , for λ (cid:29) 0. Then,
limt→−∞[γ(t)] and limt→+∞[γ(t)] exist in (W λ ∩ B(2R))/S1, and they are both projections
of stationary points of X gC
qλ .

There is also the similar result in the blow-up, which is a consequence of Lemma 2.23:
Corollary 8.20. Let [γ] : R → (W λ∩B(2R))σ/S1 be a ﬂow line of X gC,σ
, for λ (cid:29) 0. Then,

In fact, one can say more about the limiting behavior of trajectories of X gC,σ

in classical Morse theory, trajectories converge to stationary points with exponential decay

In particular, one obtains that trajectories [γ] : R → (W λ ∩

Note that our Corollary 8.18 gives a quantitative version of the quasi-gradient condition

approximate trajectory is commensurable with the drop in Fλ:
Corollary 8.21. There exists C0 > 0 such that, for any λ (cid:29) 0 and any closed interval
[t1, t2] ⊂ R, the following holds. If γ : [t1, t2] → W λ ∩ B(2R) is a trajectory of X gC

i (cid:29) 0, we are able to deﬁne the chain groups of a Morse complex for X agC,σ
for λ = λ•
on (B(2R) ∩ W λ)σ/S1 as described in Section 2.6. (After establishing the Morse-Smale
condition in Section 10, we will see this indeed gives a complex.) In this section, we relate
the gradings of stationary points of X agC,σ
with the gradings of the stationary points of
X agC,σ
. An important subtlety here is that stationary points of X agC,σ
as living in the inﬁnite-dimensional manifold W σ/S1 like those of X agC,σ
or in the smaller
ﬁnite-dimensional manifold (B(2R) ∩ W λ)σ/S1, and thus there are two ways to deﬁne
relative gradings. In Section 9.1, we equate these two relative gradings and relate them
to the relative gradings for stationary points of X agC,σ
in an appropriate grading range.
In Section 9.2, we deﬁne an absolute grading on stationary points of X agC,σ
(a shift of the
Morse index) which we relate to the absolute grading grQ on the stationary points of X agC,σ
.
Thus, the work of Section 7 together with the claimed grading correspondences will
establish an identiﬁcation between the chain groups of the Morse complex for X agC,σ
with
the monopole Floer complex in an appropriate grading range. This is summarized for the
reader’s beneﬁt in Section 9.3.

the directions along Y , whereas the latter just uses derivatives in the t direction. However,
since we are in W λ, the jth derivatives of V (t) in the Y directions are bounded (in L2) by a
constant (of the order of λj) times the L2(Y ) norm of V (t) itself. This shows that the two

Lemma 9.6. Let [(a, 0, φ)] and [(a, 0, φ(cid:48))] be stationary points of X agC,σ
as above. Assume
that κ(φ) > κ(φ(cid:48)). Then, the relative grading between these points, as computed from X agC,σ

that the relative grading between [x] and [y] is the same as the relative grading between
[xλ] and [yλ], considered as stationary points of X agC,σ
on (B(2R)∩ W λ)σ/S1. Further, the
spinorial energies of [x] and [y] are necessarily close to the λ-spinorial energies of [xλ] and [yλ]
respectively. Recall that [xλ] and [yλ] are necessarily contained in N /S1. Equation (58)
and Lemma 9.6 give that in each case, the relative gradings are computed in terms of
the orderings by eigenvalues, which correspond to (λ-)spinorial energy. In particular, this
not in N /S1, then its
implies that if [(a, 0, φ)] is a reducible stationary point of X agC,σ
associated eigenvalue cannot sit between those of [xλ] and [yλ] for any pair [xλ] and [yλ].

The following is an immediate consequence of the proof of Lemma 9.7.
Corollary 9.8. Let [x] denote the reducible stationary point of X agC,σ

[xλ] is the reducible stationary point of X agC,σ
with the lowest positive eigenvalue among
those in (B(2R) ∩ W λ)σ/S1 with the same connection component.

of this isomorphism is to identify each of these modules in a certain grading range with the
Morse homology of X agC,σ
on (B(2R) ∩ W λ)σ/S1, we need to deﬁne an absolute grading

Here: X is a simply connected, oriented, compact Riemannian four-manifold with boundary
Y (such that the metric is a product near the boundary); t is a Spinc structure on X such that
t|Y = s; D+ is the Dirac operator on (X, t) with Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary conditions,
and associated to a connection extending A0 on Y ; and indC denotes the index of a complex
operator, which is twice the real index indR. The Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary conditions
mean that the domain of D+ consists of spinors whose restrictions to Y project trivially to
the negative eigenspaces of the three-dimensional Dirac operator D.

The quantity grz(X, [x]) is the virtual dimension of the Seiberg-Witten moduli space on
X (with an added cylindrical end) with asymptotics given by x. Following the proof of
Lemma 28.3.2 in [KM07], we can compute grz(X, [x]) by using a reducible conﬁguration on

operator, and the other is a perturbed Dirac operator. The former would have index

Therefore, we have

To obtain (235), it remains to show that

the number of negative eigenvalues of l (counted with multiplicity) between −λ and 0. The
second term requires a more careful analysis. Write [xλ] = (aλ, 0, φλ). By Corollary 9.8,
[xλ] has lowest positive eigenvalue among stationary points in (B(2R)∩ W λ)σ/S1 of X agC,σ
with connection component aλ (and not just among those in N /S1). By Lemma 2.19,

ind(cid:0)[xλ] in (W λ)σ/S1(cid:1) is the sum of two parts. The ﬁrst is the number of negative eigen-

values of the linearization of l + pλcq restricted to the connection summand of W λ, i.e.

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

∗d + D(aλ,0)(pλcq)1(·, 0). The second part is the number of negative eigenvalues of the lin-
earization of l + pλcq, restricted to the spinorial summand of W λ, at (aλ, 0), i.e. D +
D(aλ,0)(pλcq)1(0,·).

Putting it all together, we ﬁnd that the left-hand side of (237) is the spectral ﬂow from

l to l + pλAλ, where

Aλ(b, ψ) = (D(aλ,0)c0

q(b, 0),D(aλ,0)c1

q(0, ψ)),

when considered as operators on W λ. However, since λ is of the form λ•
i , this is the same
as the spectral ﬂow from l to l + pλAλpλ, considered as operators from Wk to Wk−1. Thus,
to establish (237), it remains to show that there is no spectral ﬂow from l + pλAλpλ to
l + A∞, as operators from Wk to Wk−1. For the rest of the discussion, we will only consider
operators from Wk to Wk−1. Further, all these operators will have index zero (being compact
perturbations of l), and hence for them injectivity or surjectivity is equivalent to invertibility.
Due to the block form of these operators, this fact remains true if we restrict the operators
to either their connection or spinorial components.

Since [x∞] is a non-degenerate stationary point of X agC,σ

, we have that l+A∞ is injective.
(This follows from Proposition 4.13 and that this operator is index 0.) By Proposition 7.11,
we have that [xλ] is a non-degenerate reducible stationary point of X agC,σ
, and from this it
follows that l + pλAλpλ is injective. Since A∞ and pλAλpλ are L2 self-adjoint, it suﬃces to
show that for λ (cid:29) 0 and t ∈ [0, 1], l + hλ

t is the compact operator

t is injective, where hλ

to some v and as discussed, hλn
tn (vn) converges in Wk−1 to A∞(v). Thus, we see that l(vn)
converges in Wk−1 to l(v). In particular, vn converges in Wk to v, which consequently has
(cid:107)v(cid:107)L2
= 1, and (l + A∞)(v) = 0. This contradicts the injectivity of l + A∞. The relation

Recall that in Section 8, we established that X gC

qλ is a Morse equivariant quasi-gradient
vector ﬁeld on W λ∩B(2R). In this section, we show that it is also Morse-Smale, in the sense
of Deﬁnition 2.24. Recall, from Lemma 2.2 and the discussion at the end of Section 2.8
that the Morse-Smale condition can be rephrased in terms of the surjectivity of a linear
operator. In our setting, let

γ : R → (W λ ∩ B(2R))σ ⊂ (W λ)σ,

natural choice to work with an operator where the derivatives are given by a connection
coming from the ˜g-metric, the choice of connection does not matter at a trajectory.

Alternatively, we can view γ as a path in the inﬁnite dimensional space W σ. The corre-

tion 9.4. By the analogue of Lemma 5.41 with qλ instead of q, surjectivity of (239) is
equivalent to that of the operator QgC
from (217). In the proof of Lemma 9.5 we gave a

block form (229) for QgC

implies that QgC

Let us now put the results of Sections 7, 8, 9, and the current one in context. Recall that

When γ is reducible (i.e., contained in the reducible locus), there is a similar map (M)∂
acting on the space of paths in the boundary.
To prove our claim, it is enough to check that the derivative of M is surjective at all
points (γ, q) in M−1(0) when γ is irreducible; and that the derivative of (M)∂ is surjective
at reducibles. The proof of these facts is entirely similar to the proof of Proposition 15.1.3

it is our goal to establish an isomorphism between }HM (Y, s) and the (singular) equivariant

we need a way to relate these diﬀerent spaces. In this section, we will extend the correspon-
dence from Corollary 7.8 ﬁrst to a family of S1-equivariant self-diﬀeomorphisms of W σ, and
then to self-diﬀeomorphisms of W τ (I × Y ) for I ⊂ R and to other path spaces. This will
be needed in Proposition 12.22 and Proposition 13.2. The construction of these maps will
use a setup similar to that of the function Tλ deﬁned in Section 8.2.

Before stating the ﬁrst result, we need some preliminaries.

In this section, in order
to make statements about the smoothness of functions with respect to λ as a parameter,
we do not restrict to the case that λ = λ•
i . We will not use the results of Section 8 or
Section 9, so this will not be a problem. For each stationary point x∞ of X gC,σ
in N let
xλ denote the stationary point of X gC,σ
qλ which is L2 closest to x∞. (For an explanation of
the well-deﬁnedness of xλ see Section 8.2.) In what follows, we will abuse notation and say
that a function Gλ, which depends on λ, is smooth in λ at and near inﬁnity if there exists
 > 0 such that Gf−1(r) depends smoothly on r ∈ [0, ), where f : (0,∞] → [0, 1) is the
homeomorphism from Section 7.2.
Lemma 11.1. For λ (cid:29) 0, there exists an S1-equivariant diﬀeomorphism Ξλ : W σ

any statements about smoothness or regularity.

corollaries of the latter. The ﬁrst follows from part (i), by continuity:

construction of Ξλ. In Section 11.2, we prove the desired properties of Ξλ in Lemma 11.1.

The construction will be similar to that of the diﬀeomorphism Tλ used in Section 8.2 to
deﬁne Fλ. Since the blow-up is not a linear space, there is not a notion of translation like
for the deﬁnition of Tλ, so we will work in charts (in the directions orthogonal to the S1
orbits). The reader may note that here we are working with W σ
0 , while in the deﬁnitions of
Tλ and Fλ from Section 8, we only worked with Wk−1. The explanation for this is that the
function Fλ incorporated c, which is not well-behaved as a map from W0 → W0 (since it
contains quadratic terms), so we would not have been able to analyze Fλ in lower Sobolev
regularity.

A more minor distinction is the following. To construct Tλ(x), we used the function ωλ
deﬁned in (181) to ﬁnd which element of the S1-orbit of an approximate stationary point xλ
the point x is closest to, and then translate x by ωλ(x)(x∞ − xλ), where x∞ minimizes L2
distance to xλ. To deﬁne Ξλ(x), we will compare x to x∞ instead of xλ, and then translate.
The reason for this is that we will work with local charts, and it is simplest to work in charts
around the same point (x∞) for every λ, as opposed to deﬁning Ξλ in terms of diﬀerent
charts for each λ and tracking the changes.

For notation, we choose representatives x1∞, . . . , xm∞ for the m orbits of stationary points

in N .

q

Proof of Lemma 11.5. We will ﬁrst deﬁne Ξλ on an S1-invariant neighborhood of xi∞ in
0 for a ﬁxed i; for now, we omit the index i. Write x∞ = (a∞, s∞, φ∞). Consider the
W σ
submanifold

Ux∞ = {(a, s, φ) ∈ W σ

0 | Re(cid:104)φ, iφ∞(cid:105)L2 = 0,(cid:104)φ, φ∞(cid:105)L2 > 0}.

Note that Ux∞ is not open, as it only consists of conﬁgurations which are (real) orthogonal
to the S1-orbit of x∞. We will deﬁne an S1-equivariant self-diﬀeomorphism of S1 · Ux∞
which takes xλ to x∞ and is the identity outside of a smaller S1-invariant neighborhood of
x∞. We will then obtain the desired diﬀeomorphism Ξλ by repeating this construction for
each orbit of stationary points of X gC,σ
, and taking Ξλ to be the identity outside of these
neighborhoods.

q

First, we observe that there exists a diﬀeomorphism Gx∞ from Ux∞ to the Hilbert man-

ifold with boundary

Vx∞ = {(a, s, φ) ∈ (ker d∗)0 ⊕ R ⊕ L2(Y ; S) | s ≥ 0, (cid:104)φ, φ∞(cid:105)L2 = 0},

We remark that Vx∞ is a submanifold of T gC,σ

Denote this vector by z∞. Note also that in the deﬁnition of Gx∞, have that Re(cid:104)φ, φ∞(cid:105)L2 =
(cid:104)φ, φ∞(cid:105)L2, since φ is orthogonal to the S1-orbit of φ∞. Observe also that the inverse of

Since xλ = (aλ, sλ, φλ) minimizes the L2 distance from x∞ to xλ, it is necessarily orthog-

(cid:104)φλ, iφ∞(cid:105)L2 > 0, so xλ is contained in Ux∞. Let zλ denote the image of xλ under Gx∞. We

Υλ : z (cid:55)→ (1 − α((cid:107)ψ(cid:107)L2))(cid:107)z + α((cid:107)ψ(cid:107)L2)(z + z∞ − zλ),

where we write z = (b, r, ψ).

By the choice of δ, we have that this induces a well-deﬁned map on Vx∞, since in the
case that x∞ is reducible, the s-component is unchanged, and when x∞ is irreducible, we
have chosen the δ-ball such that translation does not happen near the boundary. Again,
we point out that this map is translation by z∞ − zλ inside of an L2 ball of size δ/2 in Vx∞
and is the identity outside of a δ ball. In particular, we see that zλ is taken to z∞.

By the work of Section 7, we have that
xλ → x∞ in L2

(241)

j for all j as λ → ∞

and thus

zλ → z∞ in L2

j for all j as λ → ∞.

(242)
We claim that for λ (cid:29) 0, the map Υλ in (240) induces a diﬀeomorphism of Vx∞. Indeed,
since zλ → 0, for λ (cid:29) 0, the derivative of Υλ is close to the identity, and thus is an
isomorphism at each point. The map is thus a local diﬀeomorphism, which is the identity
outside of a ball. This is necessarily a self-covering map of a simply-connected space, and
so we deduce that this is a global diﬀeomorphism.

We can now use Gx∞ to deﬁne the self-diﬀeomorphism Ξλ on Ux∞. Since Gx∞(xλ) = zλ

and Gx∞(x∞) = z∞, we see that

Ξλ := G−1

x∞ ◦ Υλ ◦ Gx∞

takes xλ to x∞.
It follows by the construction that x∞ is taken to xλ. We then extend Ξλ to a diﬀeomor-
phism on the S1 orbit of Ux∞ as follows. Deﬁne a function ω∞ : S1 · Ux∞ → S1, similar to
ωj
λ in (181), by

x (cid:55)→ ω∞(x) · Ξλ(ω∞(x) · x).

(243)

ω∞(x) =

Re(cid:104)φ, φ∞(cid:105)L2 + i Re(cid:104)φ, iφ∞(cid:105)L2

(cid:0)(Re(cid:104)φ, φ∞(cid:105)L2)2 + (Re(cid:104)φ, iφ∞(cid:105)L2)2(cid:1)1/2

.

Note that ω∞ has the property that if x ∈ S1 · Ux∞, then ω∞(x) · x ∈ Ux∞. Therefore, we
extend Ξλ to the S1 orbit of Ux∞ by conjugating by ω∞:

By construction this extension is S1-equivariant. By repeating the above construction for
each stationary point xi∞, we extend Ξλ to neighborhoods of every stationary point of N .
Note that Ξλ is the identity near the boundary of each such neighborhood. We ﬁnally
extend Ξλ to a diﬀeomorphism of all of W σ
0 by the identity outside of these neighborhoods.

For future reference, we describe an explicit formula for Ξλ. Let us ﬁrst introduce some
notation to help express Ξλ more compactly. For each i = 1, . . . , m, deﬁne a function

It is now clear from the construction that Ξλ an S1-equivariant diﬀeomorphism of W σ

Here we take as notational convention that we do not worry about the well-deﬁnedness of
ωi∞ when βi is zero. Observe that for each x, βi(x) is non-zero for at most one i.

We now discuss the extension of Ξλ to the double as claimed in the lemma. Recall that a
stationary point x∞ is reducible if and only if the approximate stationary point xλ is. From
0 with s (cid:28) 1 (i.e. s much smaller than the smallest
(244), we therefore see that for x ∈ W σ
preserves and is tangent to the reducible locus. It follows that Ξλ extends to the double(cid:102)W σ
value of s∞ for x∞ irreducible), the map Ξλ preserves the s-component. In particular, Ξλ

as claimed. It will be clear that the arguments below establishing the desired properties of
Ξλ for W σ

0 .

Remark 11.6. It is worth noting that almost all of of the pieces of Ξλ are just determined
by the spinorial component of x. Further, in the end result, the formula for Ξλ only uses
the function ω in the bump-like functions βi.

11.2. Three-dimensional properties of Ξλ. We now show that Ξλ has the stated prop-
erties in Lemma 11.1. After that, we will establish some additional bounds that will be
useful for Proposition 11.2.

We begin with the ﬁrst item in Lemma 11.1.

Proof of Lemma 11.1(i). It is clear from the construction of Ξλ, that each xi

11.2.1. Smoothness properties.

smooth on L2

of the construction of Ξλ, where Ξλ is not the identity (or in other words, some βi is non-
zero), we are simply scalar multiplying by ωi∞, which is non-zero, or by adding a multiple
of βi or (cid:104)φ, φi∞(cid:105)L2 times xi∞ or φi∞. Since xi

the desired result.
This is clear from the explicit description of Ξλ given in (244) since wherever Ξλ disagrees
with the identity, we have that βi (cid:54)= 0 for precisely one i, and in this case (cid:104)φ, ωi∞φi∞(cid:105)L2

is real and positive (in fact, at least 1/2); from this it is easy to see that Ξλ extends to a

At the beginning of this section, Ξλ was claimed to extend to a neighborhood of W σ

The following completes the proof of Lemma 11.1.

Proof of Lemma 11.1(iii). Since Ξλ is deﬁned by extending a self-diﬀeomorphism of Uxi∞ by
S1, and the space Uxi∞ is deﬁned independently of λ, it suﬃces to show that Ξf−1(r)|Uxi∞
is
smooth at and near r = 0. Recall from Corollary 7.8 that the correspondence r (cid:55)→ [xf−1(r)] is
diﬀerentiable at and near r = 0. It is easy to check that this lifts to a smoothness statement
without quotienting by S1, due to the condition that Re(cid:104)xf−1(r), ixi∞(cid:105)L2 = 0. Using (244),
we see the only terms in Ξf−1(r) or its derivatives which depend on r are smooth functions
of xf−1(r), and thus diﬀerentiable at and near r = 0. This gives the desired smoothness
(cid:3)
statement.

11.2.2. Some three-dimensional bounds on Ξλ. Before moving on to the four-dimensional
properties of Ξλ in Proposition 11.2, we study a few additional properties of Ξλ. For
notational simplicity, we work in a neighborhood S1 · Uxi∞ for some i. For the rest of this

subsection, we again omit the index i from the notation.

It is clear from (244) that the complication in Ξλ is in the spinorial component. We begin

by simplifying the notation and then establishing a few key bounds. We write

(245)

fλ(x) = φ − (cid:104)φ, φ∞(cid:105)L2 · β(x) · vλ

and thus we can express the spinorial component of Ξλ as
Ξλ can be written a bit more succinctly as

fλ

(cid:107)fλ(cid:107)L2

for x ∈ S1·Ux∞. Therefore,

(246)

Ξλ(a, s, φ) =

a + β(x)(a∞ − aλ), s + β(x)(s∞ − sλ),

fλ(x)
(cid:107)fλ(x)(cid:107)L2

We point out some bounds that will be useful for us when proving Proposition 11.2. By

(cid:107)vλ(cid:107)L2 → 0.

11.3.1. Sobolev multiplication and superposition operators. In order to study how Ξλ acts
j (I × Y ), we will need some elementary variants of Sobolev multiplication
on paths in W τ
and superposition operators. Many of these are well-known or easily deduced from the
deﬁnitions and Sobolev multiplication. We include the proofs so as to reference them for
analogous results later on that are less standard.
Lemma 11.7. Let I ⊆ R. Then, taking inner products induces smooth maps

(cid:99)Wj(I × Y ) ×(cid:99)Wj → L2

Let us focus on a ﬁxed term in the ﬁnal term above, i.e., we ﬁx a value of n, i1, i2. Note

holds if we instead replace i1 or i2 with n − i1 or n − i2 respectively, depending on their

By summing over the relevant constants, we obtain a bound

bilinear map. Such a map is necessarily smooth.

For (250), we can repeat the proof above. Note that an element of(cid:99)Wj does not determine
an element of(cid:99)Wj(I × Y ) if I is not compact. However, for each term analyzed in the above
this case, the three-dimensional conﬁguration in (cid:99)Wj is constant in time, and has bounded

argument, we only needed that one of the terms involved (either a derivative of γ or of η)
be L2(Y ) bounded uniformly in time, with the other term square-integrable in time. In

Recall that for any γ ∈(cid:99)Wj(I × Y ), we have a norm for γ(t, y), deﬁned for any (t, y) ∈ I × Y ;

We can now apply the same argument as in the ﬁrst part of Lemma 11.7 to obtain a bound

(cid:107)gγ(cid:107)L2

j (I×Y ) ≤ K(cid:107)g(cid:107)L2

where K is a constant independent of g and γ. This shows that pointwise multiplication is
continuous. Smoothness again follows by bilinearity.

The second equation can be obtained by applying the same modiﬁcations to the proof as
(cid:3)

in Lemma 11.7 to establish (250).

The following lemma is standard. We include a proof for completeness.

Lemma 11.9. Let I ⊆ R be an interval, and h : R → R a smooth function. Consider the
transformation of C∞(R) given by

H : g (cid:55)→ h ◦ g.

(a) If I is compact, then H induces a smooth map from L2
(b) The same holds true for arbitrary I (not necessarily compact), provided that h(0) = 0.

j (I; R) to L2

Proof. (a) We use Fa`a di Bruno’s formula for the higher derivatives of a composition:

(253)

dtn h(g(t)) =

(cid:88)

C(m1, . . . , mn) · h(m1+···+mn)(g(t)) · n(cid:89)

Here, the sum is taken over all n-tuples of nonnegative integers (m1, . . . , mn) with

1 · m1 + 2 · m2 + ··· + n · mn = n,

and the constants C(m1, . . . , mn) are

n!

C(m1, . . . , mn) =

m1!1!m1m2!2!m2 . . . mn!n!mn

dtn h(g(t)) is in L2(I; R), for all 0 ≤ n ≤ j.

Let g ∈ L2
derivative dn
We claim that each summand in the expression (253) is in L2. Indeed, since g is in L2
and j ≥ 1, we have that g is continuous. Further, since h is smooth, we see that the expres-
j
sion h(m1+···+mn)(g(t)) is continuous in t, and therefore bounded (because I is compact).
Moreover, unless i = n, the factors g(i)(t) are in L2
1; hence, by Sobolev multiplication, their
product is also in L2

.
j (I; R), that is, the nth

1, and thus in L2. It follows that

h(m1+···+mn)(g(t)) · n(cid:89)

(cid:0)g(i)(t)(cid:1)mi ∈ L2,

(254)

that mn = 1 and all the other mi must be zero, so(cid:0)g(i)(t)(cid:1)mi = g(n)(t) is still in L2, and

as long as mn = 0, since h(m1+···+mn) ◦ g is bounded. In the special case mn > 0, we see

i=1

we get the same conclusion.

We have shown that H maps L2

j (I; R) to L2

j (I; R). To see that H is smooth, we compute

its derivatives:

(255)

When g, ξ1, . . . , ξr ∈ L2

(DrH)g(ξ1, . . . , ξr) = (h(r) ◦ g) · ξ1 · . . . · ξr.
j (I; R), by applying the fact we just proved with h(r) instead of h,
j , we get that (DrH)g(ξ1, . . . , ξr)

j → L2

j × L2

and making use of the Sobolev multiplication L2
is in L2

j , as desired.

146

TYE LIDMAN AND CIPRIAN MANOLESCU

(b) If I is non-compact, we still have that h(m1+···+mn) and g are continuous. Further, by
the Sobolev embedding theorem, g ∈ L2
j implies that g is bounded. Therefore, it is still the
case that h(m1+···+mn)◦g is bounded. We also have the Sobolev multiplication L2
j → L2
for j ≥ 1, so the same arguments as before show that (254) holds, provided that not all mi
are zero.
Nevertheless, we claim that h(m1+···+mn)(g(t)) · 1 = h(g(t)) is in L2. To see this, we make
use of the hypothesis h(0) = 0. The derivative of h at 0 is

j given by (a, s, φ) (cid:55)→ (a,−s, φ), such that
Ξλ(a,−s, φ) = Ξλ(ι(a, s, φ)) = ι(Ξλ(a, s, φ)). When discussing the terms involved in Ξλ,
we will suppress this from the notation; for example, if (a, s, φ) has s < 0, we will write
βi(a, s, φ) instead of βi(ι(a, s, φ)). Since Ξλ is ι-equivariant, it is easy to verify that this will

formula for Ξλ in (244). Fix γ ∈(cid:102)W τ
Proof of Proposition 11.2(i). Let I be a compact interval. The idea is to apply the technical
lemmas proved above on Sobolev multiplication and superposition operators to the explicit
j (I × Y ), where we write γ(t) = (a(t), s(t), φ(t)). Recall
that (cid:107)γ(t)(cid:107)L2(Y ) = 1 for all t ∈ I. We break Ξλ into elementary pieces and study their
regularity.
First, observe that (cid:104)φ(t), φi∞(cid:105)L2(Y ) ∈ L2
j (I; R) by Lemma 11.7. By Lemma 11.8, we have
that (cid:104)φ(t), φi∞(cid:105)L2(Y ) · vi
Note that whenever γ(t) ∈ S1 · Uxi∞, we have |(cid:104)φ(t), φi∞(cid:105)L2(Y )| ≥ 1
2 by our choice of the
δ-balls in the deﬁnition of Ξλ. (Here we are using that there exists u(t) ∈ S1 such that
u(t) · φ(t) ∈ Uxi∞.) Using Lemma 11.10, formula (243), and the Sobolev multiplication

follows from Lemmas 11.8, 11.10, and 11.12 that βi(γ) ∈ L2

(246), as βn(γ) = 0 for any n (cid:54)= i, when βi(γ) (cid:54)= 0.

The smoothness of Ξλ follows from the relevant smoothness established in the sequence
of technical lemmas above about Sobolev multiplication and superposition operators. To
see that Ξλ is a diﬀeomorphism, we can apply similar arguments to show that Ξ−1
λ satisﬁes
the same regularity and smoothness properties.

We now show that Ξλ depends smoothly on λ, at and near inﬁnity. If we change the
deﬁnition of Ξλ by varying xi
λ smoothly, the arguments above (i.e., the application of
Lemmas 11.7-11.12) show that we will vary the induced diﬀeomorphism in a smooth way.
This only applies for small variations of xi

the L2 ball of size δ around φi∞, but that is all we will need. By Corollary 7.8, we see that

We need one more technical lemma about superposition operators before giving the proof.

Before moving on to Propositions 11.2(iii) and (iv) in the ﬁnal subsection, we will give
the promised proof of Proposition 11.13. This will be proved using similar techniques as for
Proposition 11.2(i); however, since we work in a region where some βn ≡ 1 (and all other
βn(cid:48) ≡ 0), we do not need to worry about ωn∞ and thus our job will be easier.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that (cid:107)x(cid:107)L2(Y ) = 1. (We can reduce to this

Similar arguments can be used to prove smoothness with respect to x.

With the above lemma, we can prove Proposition 11.13.

Proof of Proposition 11.13. Recall that by our assumptions on the path γ, we have that
βi(γ) ≡ 1 for some index i, and βn(γ) ≡ 0 for all n (cid:54)= i. Writing γ(t) = (a(t), s(t), φ(t)), we

12. Convergence of approximate trajectories

In this section and the subsequent one, we establish the analogous results of Section 7
for ﬂow trajectories instead of stationary points. In this section, we focus on results related
to the convergence of approximate trajectories to honest trajectories as λ → ∞. We now
i (cid:29) 0; we will often omit this assumption from the discussion.
return to the case that λ = λ•
12.1. Convergence downstairs. We start by discussing trajectories of X gC
qλ in the blow-
down. There are two kinds of convergence results that one expects. The simpler one is
C∞
loc convergence of parameterized trajectories, and the more reﬁned one is convergence of
unparameterized trajectories to a broken trajectory. We already know that the former kind
holds:
Proposition 12.1. Let I ⊆ R be a closed interval, and γn : I → W be a sequence of
trajectories of X gC
qλn contained in B(2R), where λn → ∞. Then, there exists a subsequence
of γn for which the restrictions to any subinterval I(cid:48) (cid:98) I converge in the C∞ topology of
W (I(cid:48) × Y ) to γ, a trajectory of X gC
Proof. As discussed in Section 6.1, l + cq satisﬁes the hypotheses of Proposition 6.2. Thus,
(cid:3)
the result follows from Lemma 6.4.
In particular, when I = R, the conclusion of Proposition 12.1 is convergence in the C∞

topology of W (R × Y ). We denote the resulting topological space by Wloc(R × Y ).
We now seek to show that a sequence of unparameterized trajectories for the approximate
equations converge, in a certain sense, to a broken trajectory of X gC
. It will be convenient
to work in the quotient W/S1. Given x ∈ W , we write [x] for its projection to W/S1. If x
is a stationary point (of X gC

When I = R, Lemma 16.2.4 in [KM07], translated into slicewise Coulomb gauge, shows
that any parameterized trajectory class [γ] of X gC
q with ﬁnite energy admits limit points [x]
and [y] at ±∞, with [x] and [y] being stationary point classes of X gC
. Corollary 8.19 gives
the analogous result for trajectory classes of X gC
qλ , provided these come from trajectories
contained in B(2R). Since the limit points are unchanged by reparameterizations, we can
also talk about the limit points of unparameterized trajectory classes.

We will represent broken trajectory classes by the tuple [˘γ] = ([˘γ1], . . . , [˘γm]).

Next, we want to say what it means for unparameterized trajectory classes of X gC

qλn to

converge to a broken trajectory class of X gC
below, which is inspired by the construction of the topology on the space of broken trajec-
tories of Xq, in [KM07, Section 16.1]. Given a trajectory γ : R → W and s ∈ R, recall that
we write τsγ for the translate, (τsγ)(t) = τ (s + t).

From Proposition 7.7 and Lemma 7.9, for any stationary point class [x] of X gC

, there
is a corresponding (nearby) stationary point class of X gC
qλ , which we denote by [xλ], and
similarly in the blow-up. We also recall from the discussion between Corollaries 8.20 and
8.21 that for λ (cid:29) 0, trajectories [γλ] of X agC,σ
in (W λ ∩ B(2R)σ)/S1 connecting stationary

points [xλ] and [yλ] are contained in BgC,τ
([xλ], [yλ]). In particular, such trajectories satisfy
k,loc(R × Y ) analogous to Deﬁni-
t γλ] = [γxλ] and limt→−∞[τ∗

tion 4.16. We have the analogous result in the blow-down as well. We will use these facts
implicitly throughout the next two sections.

We say that [˘γn] converges to the broken trajectory class [˘γ∞] = ([˘γ∞,1], . . . , [˘γ∞,m]) if,

for each i = 1, . . . , m, there exist sequences of real numbers (sn,i)n≥0 with

sn,1 < sn,2 < ··· < sn,m

and

sn,i − sn,i−1 → ∞ as n → ∞,

such that the translates [τsn,iγn] converge to some representative [γ∞,i] of [˘γ∞,i] in the quo-
tient topology of Wloc(R × Y )/S1.

the energy and the drop in Fλ are commensurable.

Using Proposition 12.1, for any other compact interval I(cid:48), we can ﬁnd  > 0 independent
of λ such that if [γ] is a trajectory class of X gC
qλ with energy at most C, and with energy at
most  when restricted to I(cid:48), then [γ]|I×Y is contained in some U[x]. (Compare with Lemma
16.2.2 in [KM07].)

Next, observe that, since the trajectory classes [γn] go from [xλn] to [yλn], and

[xλn] → [x],

[yλn] → [y], Fλn → Lq as n → ∞,

q

we have that the drop in Fλn along [γn] is bounded. Hence, the energy of [γn] is bounded,
by a constant K independent of n. With  > 0 chosen as in the previous paragraph, we
ﬁnd that, for each n, there are at most 2K/ integers p such that
E([τpγn]|[−1,1]) = E([γn]|[p−1,p+1]) > .

Therefore, for all other p, we must have [τpγn] ∈ U[x] for some stationary point class [x] of

12.2. Convergence of parameterized trajectories in the blow-up. We now move to
the blow-up W σ. We are interested in showing that the trajectories of X gC,σ
are close
to those of X gC,σ
, given appropriate control on the λ-spinorial energy. The goal of this
subsection is to establish the following convergence result for parameterized trajectories.
Before doing so, a quick notational remark. Sometimes we will be interested in studying
the image of a path in W σ/S1 in the blow-down. When doing so, we will use the notation
γτ for the path upstairs and γ for the blow-down.
Proposition 12.5. Fix ω > 0 and a compact interval I = [t1, t2] ⊂ R. Consider a smaller
interval I = [t1 + , t2 − ] for  > 0. Suppose that

Remark 12.6. The analogous compactness result for trajectories of X σ
q is Theorem 10.9.2 in
[KM07]. However, there are a few diﬀerences between the statement of Proposition 12.5 and
[KM07, Theorem 10.9.2]. Of course, the main one is that our result deals with trajectories
of the vector ﬁelds X gC,σ
in Coulomb gauge.

Another diﬀerence is that in [KM07, Theorem 10.9.2] one requires a bound on the energy
of trajectories, that is, on the drop of the perturbed Chern-Simons-Dirac functional Lq;
this is unnecessary in our setting since our trajectories are assumed to be in B(2R)σ, which
automatically gives bounds on Lq. Also, in [KM07, Theorem 10.9.2], the assumption is that
q is a k-tame perturbation, and the conclusion is convergence in L2
k+1. In our setting, q is
tame (for all k), and we will use bootstrapping and a diagonalization argument for subse-
quences to get convergence in C∞. Finally, in [KM07, Theorem 10.9.2], the conclusion is
convergence after gauge transformations. In our setting trajectories start in temporal and
slicewise global Coulomb gauge; the remaining gauge consists only of constant transforma-
tions in S1. Since S1 is compact, there is no need to change trajectories by gauge before
they converge. Compare the remark after Corollary 5.1.8 on [KM07, p.110].

Before proving Proposition 12.5, we need a couple of lemmas. The ﬁrst is the following

unique continuation result, analogous to [KM07, Proposition 10.8.1]:
Lemma 12.7. Let γ(t) = (a(t), φ(t)) be a trajectory of X gC
If φ(t) = 0 for some t, then φ(t) ≡ 0.
Proof. Since γ(t) is a trajectory, we have

qλ in B(2R) for some λ ∈ (0,∞].

− d
dt

φ(t) = Dφ(t) + (pλcq)1(γ(t)).

k(Y ; S) as
Furthermore, γ(t) is continuous and thus (pλcq)1(γ(t)) is a continuous path in L2
well. By [KM07, Lemma 7.1.3], it suﬃces to show that (cid:107)(pλcq)1(γ(t))(cid:107)L2 ≤ C(cid:107)φ(t)(cid:107)L2 for
(cid:3)
all t. This follows from Lemma 6.13.

The second result we need is the analogue of [KM07, Lemma 10.9.1]:

Lemma 12.8. There is a constant C > 0 such that, for any λ (cid:29) 0, any interval [t1, t2] ⊆ R,
trajectory γτ : [t1, t2] → B(2R)σ of X gC,σ

, and any t ∈ [t1, t2], we have

qλ

Λqλ(γτ (t)) ≤ C · (cid:107)X gC

k(Y ),

where γ is the projection of γτ in the blow-down.

Proof. This is similar to the proof of Lemma 10.9.1 in [KM07]. Note that the bound in
[KM07] involved a function ζ(γ(t)); in our case we can take this to be a constant, because
we assumed that γ(t) ⊂ B(2R).
(cid:3)
Proof of Proposition 12.5. The argument follows that of Theorem 8.1.1 and Theorem 10.9.2
in [KM07] nearly verbatim. We give the argument for completeness.

Write γτ

n(t) = (an(t), sn(t), φn(t)). First, by Proposition 12.1 we can ﬁnd a subsequence
of the blown-down sequence γn(t) = (an(t), sn(t)φn(t)) for which the restriction to any
j (I(cid:48) × Y ) norms. Choose I(cid:48) such that I (cid:98) I(cid:48). In particular, we
I(cid:48) (cid:98) I converges in all L2
j (I(cid:48) × Y ) norms on a(t). Therefore, we will now
have bounds (and convergence) for all L2
focus on the convergence of sn(t) and φn(t).

By Lemma 12.7, each trajectory is either slicewise reducible or irreducible. After passing
to a further subsequence, we can assume that γτ
n are all of the same type. We ﬁrst consider
the case that γτ
n(t) are irreducible for all n and t. If the limit of γn is irreducible, we are
done using the result in the blow-down. Therefore, we assume that the limit is reducible
for all t. It will be useful to simultaneously think of sn(t)φn(t) as a four-dimensional spinor

znΦn, where zn = (cid:107)snφn(cid:107)L2(I×Y ) and (cid:107)Φn(cid:107)L2(I×Y ) = 1, so znΦn = snφn. (We have zn (cid:54)= 0
since sn(t) (cid:54)= 0 for every t ∈ I(cid:48).) The subtle change from I(cid:48) to I when computing L2 norms
will be used shortly.

Since γn is an approximate trajectory in the blow-down, so is eiθγn, and therefore we see

that

−D+(eiθznΦn) = (pλncq)1(an, eiθznΦn),

for all θ. (Here D+ denotes the Dirac operator in four-dimensions for the trivial connection
induced by A0.) By diﬀerentiating with respect to θ and evaluating at θ = 0, we obtain

−D+(znΦn) = Dγn(pλncq)1(0, znΦn),

and thus by complex linearity,

−D+(Φn) = Dγn(pλncq)1(0, Φn).

By Lemma 6.12, the L2(I(cid:48) × Y ) bounds on Φn and L2

k(I(cid:48) × Y ) bounds on γn give that
the right-hand side is L2(I(cid:48) × Y ) bounded. By ellipticity, we see that Φn is L2
1-bounded on
j (I × Y ) bounds on the
any interior cylinder. We can do further bootstrapping to obtain L2
four-dimensional spinor Φn for all j. In particular, we can arrange for a further subsequence
for which Φn converges in all L2
uniformly bounded in n and t ∈ I. Since −Λqλn (γτ
exists a constant K > 0 independent of n and t ∈ I such that

j (I × Y ) norms to a spinor Φ with (cid:107)Φ(cid:107)L2(I×Y ) = 1.
By Lemma 12.8 and the bounds on Λqλn at the endpoints of I, we see that Λqλn (γτ

n(t)) is
dt log sn(t), it follows that there

n(t)) = d
sn(t) ≥ K(cid:107)sn(cid:107)L2(I) = Kzn,

(cid:107)Φn(t)(cid:107)L2(Y ) ≥ K > 0

and thus

Φn(t)

(cid:107)Φn(t)(cid:107)L2(Y )

j (I × Y ) norms (and thus uniformly in all L2
for all t. Since Φn converges to Φ in all L2
is bounded in all L2
norms), we see that φn(t) =
It follows that we have the desired convergence for the φn.
We now focus on the convergence for sn. Of course, rather than obtaining bounds on
j (I× Y ) norms as above, we could have used any intermediate cylinder with I ⊂ I(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:98) I(cid:48).
L2
We in fact opt for I(cid:48)(cid:48), since we will need to bootstrap again to get L2
j (I) bounds on sn. By
j (I(cid:48)(cid:48) × Y ) norms, we see

12.3. Near-constant approximate trajectories. This subsection contains several tech-
nical results, analogous to the ones in Sections 13.4 and 13.5 of [KM07]. We will use these to
study the moduli spaces of broken trajectories of X agC,σ
, leading up to Propositions 12.17
and 12.22 below.
We start by establishing the analogue of Lemma 13.4.4 in [KM07], which gives bounds
on the distance of a trajectory from a constant trajectory on [t1, t2] × Y in terms of Lq.
Write I = [t1, t2]. We follow the notation of Sections 8.2 and 8.5. More precisely, given a
stationary point x∞ = (a∞, φ∞) of X gC
, there is an associated orbit Oλ of stationary points
of X gC
Lemma 12.10. Fix a stationary point x∞ = (a∞, φ∞) of X gC
, which we treat as a (con-
stant) trajectory of X gC
on I × Y . There exists an S1-invariant neighborhood U of x∞ in
W1(I × Y ) and a constant C independent of λ (cid:29) 0 satisfying the following. If γ ∈ U is a

of γ that moves it into the Coulomb-Neumann slice through x∞. In our context, since we
prefer to work with γ in slicewise global Coulomb gauge, we choose u ∈ S1 so that

To suppress u from the notation, for the rest of the proof, we assume Re(cid:104)γ(t1), (0, iφλ)(cid:105)L2(Y ) =

In [KM07, Sections 13.4 and 13.5], Lemma 13.4.4 is the starting point for a sequence of re-
sults about trajectories in neighborhoods of stationary points. In our setting, Lemma 12.10
above gives analogous results, by essentially the same arguments. We state the main results
below, but omit the proofs.

First, by bootstrapping, we obtain the following from Lemma 12.10, analogous to [KM07,

Proposition 13.4.7].
Lemma 12.11. Fix a stationary point x∞ of X gC
, which we treat as a (constant) trajectory
of X gC
on I × Y . There exists an S1-invariant neighborhood U of x∞ in Wk(I × Y ) and a
constant C independent of λ (cid:29) 0 satisfying the following. If γ ∈ U is a trajectory of X gC
qλ ,
there exists a constant gauge transformation u ∈ S1 such that

k+1(I(cid:48)×Y ) ≤ C(Fλ(γ(t2)) − Fλ(γ(t1))),

Next, we have two results about trajectories in the blow-up. These are the analogues of

Proposition 13.4.1 and Corollary 13.4.8 in [KM07] respectively.
Proposition 12.12. Let x∞ ∈ B(2R)σ be a stationary point of X gC,σ
tionary point of X gC,σ
gauge-invariant neighborhood U of the constant trajectory x∞ in W τ
of λ, such that for every trajectory γτ : I → (W λ ∩ B(2R))σ of X gC,σ
there is a gauge transformation u ∈ S1 such that:
(i) if x∞ is irreducible, then

and xλ the corre-
sponding stationary point of X gC,σ

borhood U of the constant trajectory in Wk([−1, 1] × Y ) obtained from blowing down x∞,
independent of λ (cid:29) 0, with the following property. If γτ : [−1, 1] → (W λ ∩ B(2R))σ is a

For trajectories that converge to stationary points at the ends, we are able to obtain
exponential decay on the value of Fλ near stationary points in the blow-up, analogous to
that in [KM07, Proposition 13.5.1]. Since Fλ : W λ ∩ B(2R) → R is S1-invariant, we obtain
an induced map from (W λ ∩ B(2R))σ/S1 to R. By a slight abuse of notation we will use
Fλ for this induced map as well. Recall from Section 7, for every stationary point [x∞] of

12.4. Convergence of unparameterized trajectories in the blow-up. Our goal in
this subsection is to prove analogues of the results in Section 12.1 in the blow-up. Similarly

will now consider stationary points [x] ∈ W σ/S1 of the vector ﬁelds X agC,σ

Unlike in the blow-down, we omit the word “class” since the relevant objects arise from
actual vector ﬁelds on the (smooth) quotients by S1.

We will only consider trajectories of X agC,σ

that limit to two stationary points. (Lemma
16.3.3 in [KM07], translated into slicewise Coulomb gauge, gives conditions for this to
happen—but we will not need it here.) For trajectories of X agC,σ
, Corollary 8.20 shows
the existence of limiting points, provided that the trajectories are contained in (W λ ∩
B(2R))σ/S1.

Finally, analogous to Deﬁnitions 12.2 and 12.3, we have the notions of unparameter-
ized broken trajectories and convergence to them. In particular, convergence to a broken
trajectory is deﬁned in terms of the convergence of some parameterized representatives in
loc(R × Y )/S1.

energies of xλn and yλn. Consider the projections γn of the trajectories γτ
n to the blow-down.
Following the proof of Proposition 12.4, we ﬁnd a decomposition of R into a ﬁnite number,
independent of n, of intervals of two types: J i

as in Corollary 12.16, and I i

Lemma 12.19. There exists a constant C > 0 independent of λ (cid:29) 0 with the following

The following is the analogue of [KM07, Lemma 16.3.2], and has a similar proof. It is a
consequence of the convergence of parameterized trajectories in the blow-up, Corollary 12.9.
Lemma 12.20. For each stationary point x of X gC,σ
, choose a gauge-invariant neighbor-
k (I × Y ) of the associated constant trajectory. Further, let I(cid:48) be any other
hood Ux ⊂ W τ
interval with non-zero length. Then, there exists  > 0 such that for λ (cid:29) 0, if γ ∈ M (yλ, y(cid:48)
λ)
(γ) ≤ , then
for stationary points yλ, y(cid:48)
γ|I×Y ∈ Ux for some x.
Proof of Proposition 12.17. Lemma 12.19 guarantees that Λqλn is bounded for all trajecto-
ries between [xλn] and [yλn]. Therefore, we may repeat the argument of Proposition 12.4,
where we now apply Corollary 12.9 and Lemma 12.20 in place of Proposition 12.1 and we
require that where we see bounds involving terms of the form E I (γ), we also have analogous
(cid:3)
bounds on KI (γ).
Corollary 12.21. Fix  > 0. For λ (cid:29) 0, the following is true. Suppose that [γλ] is a

in Wk,loc(R × Y )/S1 to [γ], a trajectory of X agC,σ
Proof. We argue by contradiction. Suppose there exists a sequence of trajectories [γλn],
where λn → ∞, which are always at least distance  from trajectories of X agC,σ
. Without
loss of generality, none of the trajectories are boundary-obstructed. A similar argument
for the index 0 and boundary-obstructed case follows similarly. By Proposition 12.17,
there exists a subsequence such that the unparameterized trajectories converge to a broken

remains to show that this trajectory is in fact unbroken.

It
We suppose that [˘γ∞] = ([˘γ∞,1], . . . , [˘γ∞,m]) with m ≥ 2. By our non-degeneracy as-
sumption, one [˘γ∞,i] must be be index 1, while the other trajectories must be index 0.
Note that an index 0 trajectory must be boundary-obstructed (or else the moduli space is
necessarily empty), and thus there can be at most one such trajectory. In particular, we
see that [˘γ∞] = ([˘γ∞,1], [˘γ∞,2]). Since we are assuming that the trajectories [γλn] are not
boundary-obstructed, it follows that one of [˘γ∞,1] or [˘γ∞,2] goes from boundary-unstable
to boundary-stable or one of [x∞] or [y∞] is irreducible.
In either case, we have that
that one of the components of [˘γ∞] is an irreducible trajectory (see [KM07, Proposition
14.5.7] or the discussion at the end of Section 4.5). This implies that M ([x∞], [y∞]) must
contain an irreducible trajectory. This contradicts [KM07, Corollary 16.5.4], which im-
plies that if ˘M ([x∞], [y∞]) contains a once-broken trajectory in the compactiﬁcation and
contains an irreducible trajectory, no component of the broken trajectory can be boundary-

in

Lemma 11.1 and then to self-diﬀeomorphisms of path spaces in Proposition 11.2. We now
use these self-diﬀeomorphisms to improve the L2

L2
k convergence.
Proposition 12.22. Let [γn] : R → (W λn ∩ B(2R))σ/S1 be a sequence of trajectories of
X agC,σ
between stationary points [xλn] and [yλn]. Further, suppose that the unparameterized
trajectory [˘γn] converges to [˘γ∞], an unbroken trajectory of X agC,σ
from [x∞] to [y∞]. Then,
after possible reparameterization, Ξλn([γn]) converges to [γ∞] in BgC,τ
([x∞], [y∞]), where
[γ∞] is a representative of [˘γ∞].
Proof. We choose representative trajectories γn of X gC,σ
of the trajectory
classes such that γn converges to γ∞. (This is easy to arrange, since these are only S1-
equivalence classes.) This means there exists a sequence sn ∈ R such that τsnγn → γ∞ in

13. Characterization of approximate trajectories

In this section, using the inverse function theorem, we will identify the moduli spaces of
isolated approximate trajectories (in a ﬁxed grading range) with those of actual trajecto-
ries. We will also produce similar identiﬁcations for the cut moduli spaces used to deﬁne
the U -actions in Morse and Floer homology. Furthermore, we will show that all these
identiﬁcations can be chosen to preserve orientations.
13.1. Stability. Let [x∞] and [y∞] be two stationary points of X agC,σ
, with grading in
[−N, N ]; in other words, we have [x∞], [y∞] ∈ CN . We assume that their grading diﬀer-
ence is one and that we are not in the boundary-obstructed case. (Recall that boundary-
obstructed means that [x∞] is boundary-stable and [y∞] is boundary-unstable.) Since q is
an admissible perturbation, the moduli space

˘M agC([x∞], [y∞]) = M agC([x∞], [y∞])/R

is a ﬁnite set of points. We can view ˘M agC([x∞], [y∞]) as the zero set of the section

˘M agC([x∞], [y∞]), there is a unique approximate trajectory. Second, we show that no other
approximate trajectories between [xλ] and [yλ] exist.

We start with the ﬁrst step. This is a stability result, similar to what we established in

Proposition 7.7 for stationary points.
Proposition 13.2. Suppose [x∞], [y∞] ∈ CN have gr([x∞], [y∞]) = 1, and we are not
in the boundary-obstructed case. Fix a trajectory [γ∞] ∈ ˘M agC([x∞], [y∞]), and a small
neighborhood U of [γ∞] in BgC,τ
Then, for λ (cid:29) 0, there exists a unique trajectory [γλ] ∈ ˘M agC([xλ], [yλ]) such that

γλ must be contained in B(2R)σ. Further, we see that the values of Λqλ(γλ) are uniformly
close to those of Λq(γ), and thus uniformly bounded. By Lemma 6.15, we see that γλ is
contained in (W λ)σ for λ (cid:29) 0, which completes the proof.

13.2. The U -maps. In Section 4.7 we gave the deﬁnition of the U -maps in monopole Floer
homology, in terms of cut-down moduli spaces M ([x], [y]) ∩ Z and M red([x], [y]) ∩ Z ; cf.
Equations (55) and (56). Moreover, in Section 5.12 we identiﬁed these cut-down moduli
spaces with similar ones in Coulomb gauge:

homology groups as in Section 2.7.

We now focus on the cut-down moduli spaces of the form

M agC([xλ], [yλ]) ∩ Z agC and M agC,red([xλ], [yλ]) ∩ Z agC,

for [x∞], [y∞] ∈ CN . These moduli spaces suﬃce to determine the U -action in gradings
from −N to N .
Proposition 13.5. (a) Suppose [x∞], [y∞] ∈ CN have gr([x∞], [y∞]) = 2 and are not

(b) Let [x∞], [y∞] ∈ CN be reducible stationary points with gr([x∞], [y∞]) = 1 and
i (cid:29) 0, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
boundary obstructed. For λ = λ•
M agC,red([x∞], [y∞]) ∩ Z agC and M agC,red([xλ], [yλ]) ∩ Z agC.
Proof. Part (a) is the analogue of Proposition 13.1, and its proof is similar. Since the
grading diﬀerence between [x∞] and [y∞] (and hence also between [xλ] and [yλ]) is two, the
cut-down moduli spaces in question are zero-dimensional. Consider a trajectory

[γ] ∈ M agC([x∞], [y∞]) ∩ Z agC.

Recall that the intersection is taken at time t = 0, that is, we have [γ(0)] ∈ Z agC. The
fact that the moduli space M agC([x∞], [y∞]) ∩ Z agC is cut out transversely at [γ] can be
rephrased in terms of the invertibility of the linear operator

An application of the inverse function theorem shows that in a neighborhood of [γ]
there is a unique element of M agC([xλ], [yλ]) ∩ Z agC (after applying the corresponding
diﬀeomorphism Ξλ). This produces at least as many elements of M agC([xλ], [yλ]) ∩ Z agC
as there are in M agC([x∞], [y∞]) ∩ Z agC. To see that there are no more, notice that, given
a sequence [γn] ∈ M agC([xλn], [yλn]) ∩ Z agC with λn → ∞, the sequence Ξλn([γn]) admits
a convergent subsequence, and the limit must be an element of M agC([x∞], [y∞]) ∩ Z agC.

Part (b) is the analogue of Proposition 13.4, and again the proof is similar.

13.3. Orientations. Recall that in Section 5.13 we oriented the moduli spaces of trajec-

on trivializing the determinant lines det(P gC
from (160). The same
procedure, but using operators P gC
γ deﬁned with the perturbation qλ instead of q, can be
used to orient the moduli spaces of trajectories of X gC,σ

(in inﬁnite dimensions).

We would like to relate the orientations of the moduli spaces of trajectories of X gC,σ

to the
orientations in (ﬁnite dimensional) Morse homology and to the orientations of the moduli
spaces of trajectories of X gC,σ
used in the deﬁnition of monopole Floer homology (recast in
Coulomb gauge). For the moduli spaces of approximate Seiberg-Witten trajectories in the
setting of ﬁnite dimensional Morse homology, we use the third construction of orientations
discussed in Section 2.2, in terms of a specialized coherent orientation (cf. Deﬁnition 2.3).
This is based on trivializing determinant lines det( ˜Lγ), for the operators ˜Lγ deﬁned in (7).

Write (cid:101)Fγ for the analogous operator on the compact cylinder coupled with spectral projec-
tions. Note that while the operator (cid:101)Fγ depends on the path, the domain and target do not.
We also write (cid:101)F0 for the analogous operator without the term (cid:104)φ(t), Dφ(t)(cid:105)L2ψ(t).
We seek to show that there are trivializations of det((cid:101)Fγ) which respect concatenations of
paths. First, note that the spectral decomposition of (W λ)⊥ corresponding to (cid:101)Fγ is indepen-
dent of γ; indeed, since φ(t) ∈ W λ and ψ(t) ∈ (W λ)⊥, we have that (cid:107)(cid:104)φ(t), Dφ(t)(cid:105)L2ψ(t)(cid:107)L2(Y )
have the same spectral decomposition for any convex combination of (cid:101)Fγ and (cid:101)F0. Note that
< λ(cid:107)ψ(t)(cid:107)L2(Y ), while (cid:107)Dψ(t)(cid:107)L2(Y ) ≥ λ(cid:107)ψ(t)(cid:107)L2(Y ) and the claim follows. Further, we
(1− r)(cid:101)F0 + r(cid:101)Fγ diﬀers from ˜F0 by a compact operator. Thus, we have a homotopy between
˜Fγ and (cid:101)F0 through Fredholm operators, which induces an identiﬁcation between det((cid:101)Fγ)
and det((cid:101)F0). This identiﬁcation can easily be seen to respect concatenations. Therefore,
we have an identiﬁcation of det((cid:101)Fγ), for each γ,with a ﬁxed determinant line bundle (inde-
of det((cid:101)Fγ) by simply ﬁxing a trivialization of det((cid:101)F0).

pendent of γ) which respects concatenation. Thus, we can ﬁnd compatible trivializations

The above discussion shows that a trivialization of det(P gC

γ ) is equivalent to a trivializa-
tion of det( ˜Lγ) in a way which respects concatenation of paths. It follows that an orientation
data system in Coulomb gauge gives rise to a specialized coherent orientation on the ﬁnite
dimensional approximation (B(2R) ∩ W λ)σ/S1. Once we ﬁx these orientations, we obtain
the following.

Proposition 13.6. The bijective correspondences described in Propositions 13.1, 13.4 and
13.5 are orientation-preserving.

Proof. From the above construction, we see that, on the moduli spaces of approximate
Seiberg-Witten trajectories, the signs deﬁned using P gC
(with qλ) coincide with those de-
ﬁned using ˜Lγ.

Further, as λ varies on an interval [λ0,∞] (including inﬁnity), the moduli spaces ˘M agC([xλ], [yλ])

γ

form a continuous family, carrying determinant line bundles given by det(P gC
γ ). These bun-
dles vary continuously, so the trivialization at any ﬁnite λ agrees with the one at ∞, under
the correspondence from Proposition 13.1.
(cid:3)

The same argument applies to the other two correspondences.

By Proposition 13.5, the U -maps on these chain complexes, deﬁned in (19) and (57) for

isomorphism with (271) and (276), we see that

for i ∈ [−N + 1, N − 1]. Again, this isomorphism respects the U -action. Since N was
(cid:3)
arbitrary, we obtain the desired result.

Proof of Corollary 1.2. Recall that Bloom’s variant of monopole Floer homology, (cid:103)HM (Y, s),
on }CM (Y, s, q).
that (cid:103)HM (Y, s; F ) is isomorphic to the homology of the mapping cone of the U -map on
}HM (Y, s; F ), thought of as a complex equipped with the trivial diﬀerential. By Theorem 1.1,
(cid:103)HM (Y, s; F ) is calculated as the mapping cone of the U -map on (cid:101)H S1∗ (SWF(Y, s); F ). Ap-

If F is a ﬁeld, the long exact sequence induced by the U -map on homology shows

plying the following lemma with Z/pkZ- and Q-coeﬃcients, together with the universal
(cid:3)
coeﬃcient theorem, completes the proof.

Lemma 14.1. Let X be a based, ﬁnite S1-CW complex. Then, for any ﬁeld F , we have a

graded isomorphism (cid:101)H n(X; F ) ∼= (cid:101)H n([H∗

U−→ (cid:101)H∗−2

S1(X; F )]1

S1 (X; F )).

Here, [C]1 means we are shifting the degree of C by 1.
Proof. Since the diagonal action of S1 is free on X ∧ ES1
+ → X∧S1 ES1
X∧ES1
This bundle is isomorphic to the pullback bundle of the map π : X ∧S1 ES1
+; F ) e∪−→ (cid:101)H n+1(X ∧S1 ES1
. . . → (cid:101)H n(X ∧ ES1
is an associated Gysin sequence:

+ := (X∧ES1
+; F ) → (cid:101)H n−1(X ∧S1 ES1

+, we have that the orbit map
+)/S1 is a principal S1-bundle (away from the basepoint).
+ → BS1. There

+; F ) → . . . ,

where e is the Euler class of this S1-bundle. Since the Euler class agrees with the ﬁrst Chern
class, e is by deﬁnition π∗(U ), where U is the generator of H 2(BS1; F ). Because ES1 is
contractible, we can rewrite the Gysin sequence as

. . . → (cid:101)H n(X; F ) → (cid:101)H n−1

S1 (X; F )

π∗(U )∪−−−−→ (cid:101)H n+1

S1 (X; F ) → . . .

However, cup product with π∗(U ) corresponds precisely to the U -action in the F [U ]-module
structure on H∗
(cid:3)

S1(X; Z). The Gysin sequence now gives the desired isomorphism.

THE EQUIVALENCE OF TWO SEIBERG-WITTEN FLOER HOMOLOGIES

175

Proof of Corollary 1.3. This follows from Theorem 1.1, given that δ and −h are obtained

in the same way from }HM resp. (cid:101)H S1∗ (SWF); they are both half of the grading of the
CGH12a], the minus and hat ﬂavors of Heegard Floer homology are isomorphic to }HM resp.
(cid:103)HM . Thus, the ﬁrst two isomorphisms in Corollary 1.4 are consequences of Theorem 1.1

lowest nontrivial element in the inﬁnite U -tail of the corresponding homology group with
(cid:3)
Q coeﬃcients.
Proof of Corollary 1.4. By the Seiberg-Witten / Heegaard Floer equivalence [KLT10a, CGH12b,

and Corollary 1.2.

To get the isomorphism between HF − and co-Borel homology, we can apply the iso-
morphism between HF + and Borel homology to Y with the orientation reversed. Indeed,
there is a duality between HF −(−Y, s) and the cohomology version of HF +(Y, s); see [OS04,
Proposition 2.5]. Similarly, co-Borel homology is isomorphic (up to a reversal of degrees)
to the Borel cohomology of the dual spectrum, and SWF(Y, s) is dual to SWF(−Y, s) by
[Man03, §9, Remark 2]. Cohomology theories can be related back to homologies by the
universal coeﬃcient theorem.
To get the isomorphism between HF ∞ and Tate homology, note that HF ∞ can be ob-
tained from HF − by inverting the variable U . Similarly, Tate homology is obtained from
(cid:3)
co-Borel homology by inverting U .
