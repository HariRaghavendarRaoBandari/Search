In this paper we describe a new method of obtaining ideal solu-
tions of the well-known Tarry-Escott problem, that is, the problem
of ﬁnding two distinct sets of integers xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , k + 1 and
r = 1, 2, . . . , k,
where k is a given positive integer. When k > 3, only a limited number
of parametric/ numerical ideal solutions of the Tarry-Escott problem
are known.
In this paper, by applying the new method mentioned
above, we ﬁnd several new parametric ideal solutions of the problem
when k ≤ 7. The ideal solutions obtained by this new approach are
more general and very frequently, simpler than the ideal solutions ob-
tained by the earlier methods. We also obtain new parametric solutions
of certain diophantine systems that are closely related to the Tarry-
Escott problem. These solutions are also more general and simpler
than the solutions of these diophantine systems published earlier.

Introduction

The Tarry-Escott problem (henceforth written brieﬂy as TEP) of de-
gree k consists of ﬁnding two distinct sets of integers {x1, x2, . . . , xs} and
{y1, y2, . . . , ys} such that

(1.1)

i ,

r = 1, 2, . . . , k,

where k is a given positive integer.

According to a well-known theorem of Frolov [11, p. 614], the relations

(1.1) imply that for any arbitrary integers M and K,

(1.2)

s

s

(M xi + K)r =

Xi=1

(M yi + K)r,

Xi=1

r = 1, 2, . . . , k.

Thus, if xi = ai, yi = bi, i = 1, 2, . . . , s is a solution of the diophantine
system (1.1), then xi = M ai + K, yi = M bi + K, i = 1, 2, . . . , s, is also a
solution of (1.1), and all such solutions will be considered equivalent.

system (1.1), there is an equivalent one such that Ps

It follows from Frolov’s theorem that for each solution of the diophantine
i=1 yi
and the greatest common divisor of the integers xi, yi, i = 1, 2, . . . , s, is 1.
This is known as the reduced form of the solution. If xi, yi, i = 1, 2, . . . , s
is the reduced form of some solution of (1.1), then it is easy to see that the
only other possible reduced form of the solution is −xi, −yi, i = 1, 2, . . . , s,
and so the reduced form of a solution is essentially unique.

i=1 xi = 0 = Ps

We recall that a solution of (1.1) is said to be a symmetric solution if
it satisﬁes the additional conditions (if necessary, on re-arrangement) xi =
−yi, i = 1, 2, . . . , s, when s is odd, or the conditions xi = −xs+1−i, yi =
−ys+1−i,
i = 1, 2, . . . , s/2, when s is even. Solutions that are equivalent
to symmetric solutions are also considered to be symmetric. Solutions that
are not symmetric are called nonsymmetric.

It is well-known that for a non-trivial solution of (1.1) to exist, we must
have s ≥ (k + 1) [11, p. 616]. Solutions of (1.1) with the minimum possible
value of s, that is, with s = k + 1, are known as ideal solutions of the prob-
lem. The problem of ﬁnding such ideal solutions has attracted considerable
attention. The complete ideal solution of the TEP is known only when k = 2
or 3 [8, pp. 52, 55-58]. A limited number of parametric ideal solutions of the
TEP are known when 4 ≤ k ≤ 7 ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [10], [12, pp. 41-54]),
and inﬁnitely many numerical ideal solutions are known when k = 8, 9 ([13],
[15]) and k = 11 [6].

In this paper we describe a new method of ﬁnding ideal solutions of the
TEP. As a ﬁrst step, we will ﬁnd solutions of (1.1) for large values of s such
that xi, yi are the terms of a certain number of arithmetic progressions,
and we then use these solutions of the TEP to obtain ideal solutions. We
describe the method in greater detail in Section 2. This new method could
easily be applied to obtain the complete ideal solution of the TEP of degrees
2 and 3 but since the complete solution is already known in these cases (see
[8, pp. 52, 55-58]), we omit these solutions. We apply the new method in
Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 to obtain several ideal solutions of the TEP of degrees
4, 5, 6 and 7 respectively. All of these ideal solutions will be presented in the
reduced form. The ideal solutions obtained in this paper are more general
and very frequently, simpler than the ideal solutions obtained by the earlier
methods.

In Section 7 we use the new method to derive parametric solutions of
some diophantine systems that are closely related to the TEP. These solu-
tions are also more general and simpler than the known results concerning
these diophantine systems. As an example, we obtain a simple parametric
solution, in terms of polynomials of degree 2, of the following diophantine

Till now only one parametric solution of the diophantine system (1.3), in
terms of polynomials of degree 14, had been obtained [7].

2 A general method of obtaining new solutions of

the Tarry-Escott problem

Our new approach to the TEP is based on a well-known lemma [11, p.

615] which is given below without proof.

Lemma 1. If there exist integers xi, yi, i = 1, 2, . . . , s, such that the rela-
tions (1.1) are satisﬁed, then

s

s

(2.1)

{xr

i + (yi + h)r} =

Xi=1

{(xi + h)r + yr

i },

Xi=1

r = 1, 2, . . . , k, k + 1,

where h is an arbitrary integer.

We will now describe the general method adopted in this paper. We will
ﬁrst ﬁnd a solution of the diophantine system (1.1) taking the numbers xi
and yi as the terms of three or more arithmetic progressions and directly
solving the resulting diophantine equations. We will not impose any upper
limit on the number of terms s on either side of (1.1) and, in fact, the integer
s could be much larger than k. If xi = ai, yi = bi, i = 1, 2, . . . , s, is any
solution of the diophantine system (1.1), we will write this solution brieﬂy
as,

(2.2)

a1, a2, . . . , as

k= b1, b2, . . . , bs.

Let us assume that we obtain a solution of (1.1) given by,

(2.3)

α1, α2, . . . , αm, β1, β2, . . . , βn

k
= γ1, γ2, . . . , γm, δ1, δ2, . . . , δn,

with α1, α2, . . . , αm and β1, β2, . . . , βn being two arithmetic progressions
consisting of m and n terms respectively where m and n could be arbitrarily
large integers, while γ1, γ2, . . . , γm and δ1, δ2, . . . , δn are similarly the terms
of two arithmetic progressions consisting of m and n terms respectively.

3

If the common diﬀerence of all the four arithmetic progressions is the
same, say d, we apply Lemma 1 to the solution (2.3) taking h = d, and thus
obtain the solution,

α1, α2, . . . , αm, β1, β2, . . . , βn, γ2, γ3, . . . , γm + d, δ2, δ3, . . . , δn + d
k+1
= α2, α3, . . . , αm + d, β2, β3, . . . , βn + d, γ1, γ2, . . . , γm, δ1, δ2, . . . , δn,

and on cancelling out the common terms on both sides, we obtain the solu-
tion,

α1, β1, γm + d, δn + d

k+1
= αm + d, βn + d, γ1, δ1.

As a further example, if in the solution (2.3), the arithmetic progres-
sions α1, α2, . . . , αm and γ1, γ2, . . . , γm have common diﬀerence d1 while
the arithmetic progressions β1, β2, . . . , βn and δ1, δ2, . . . , δn have common
diﬀerence d2 with d1 6= d2, we will apply Lemma 1 twice in succession, ﬁrst
taking h = d1 when we get, after cancellation of common terms, the solution,

α1, β1, β2, . . . , βn, γm + d1, δ1 + d1, δ2 + d1, . . . , δn + d1

k+1
= αm + d1, β1 + d1, β2 + d1, . . . , βn + d1, γ1, δ1, δ2, . . . , δn,

and to this solution, we again apply Lemma 1, this time taking h = d2, and
we thus get, after cancellation of common terms, the following solution:

α1, β1, γm + d1, δ1 + d1, αm + d1 + d2, βn + d1 + d2, γ1 + d2, δn + d2

k+2
= α1 + d2, βn + d2, γm + d1 + d2, δn + d1 + d2, αm + d1, β1 + d1, γ1, δ1.

It would be observed that in both of the illustrative examples given
above, the number of terms on either side of the ﬁnal solution is independent
of the number of terms on either side of (2.3). If the initial solution (2.3) is in
terms of a certain number of arbitrary parameters, so is the ﬁnal solution,
and by choice of parameters, we can further reduce the number of terms
on either side of the ﬁnal solution. We will see examples of this type in
Sections 3 and 5.

As already mentioned, we will ﬁnd solutions of (1.1) with values of xi, yi
being given by terms of certain arithmetic progressions. For facility of com-
putation, we will invariably choose the arithmetic progressions to consist of
an even number of terms of the type,

(2.4)

a − (2n − 1)d, a − (2n − 3)d, . . . , a − 3d, a − d,

a + d, a + 3d, . . . , . . . , a + (2n − 3)d, a + (2n − 1)d.

We will refer to the 2n terms given by (2.4), and having common diﬀerence
2d, as the terms of the arithmetic progression [a, n, d].

We will denote by Sk(a, n, d) the sum of kth powers of the terms given

by (2.4), that is,

n

(2.5)

Sk(a, n, d) =

{(a − (2j − 1)d)k + (a + (2j − 1)d)k}.

Xj=1

4

The following formulae are readily obtained using any standard symbolic
algebra software such as MAPLE or Mathematica, and will be used fre-
quently:

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

S1(a, n, d) = 2na,
S2(a, n, d) = 2na2 + 2n(4n2 − 1)d2/3,
S3(a, n, d) = 2na3 + 2n(4n2 − 1)ad2,
S4(a, n, d) = 2na4 + 4n(4n2 − 1)a2d2

+ 2n(4n2 − 1)(12n2 − 7)d4/15.

We will now obtain solutions of (1.1) with xi, yi, being given by the
terms of certain arithmetic progressions [aj, mj, dj] and [bj, nj, dj]. The
initial choice of the number of arithmetic progressions on either side of (1.1)
as well as the number of terms and the common diﬀerence of each arith-
metic progression is to be made suitably so that the resulting diophantine
equations can be solved. After obtaining a solution of (1.1), we will apply
Lemma 1 either once or twice, as necessary, to obtain the desired solutions
of the TEP. In several cases the solutions obtained have mj, nj as arbitrary
parameters. In our initial assumption, mj and nj are necessarily integers.
The ﬁnal parametric solutions of the TEP are, however, a ﬁnite number of
polynomial identities of ﬁnite degree, and since these identities are true for
all the inﬁnitely many integer values of mj and nj, it follows that they are
also true for all rational values of the parameters mj and nj.

We note that since all the equations of the diophantine system (1.1) are
homogeneous, if xi = ai, yi = bi is any solution of (1.1), and ρ is any nonzero
rational number, then xi = ρai, yi = ρbi is also a solution of (1.1). Thus any
rational solution of (1.1) yields a solution in integers on multiplying through
by a suitable constant. Hence it suﬃces to obtain rational solutions of (1.1),
and in the parametric solutions that we obtain, the arbitrary parameters
may be assigned any rational values. For the sake of brevity, we will omit
the factor ρ while writing the solutions of (1.1).

Ideal solutions of the Tarry-Escott problem of
degree 4

We note that the complete ideal symmetric solution of degree 4 has
been given by Choudhry [4]. We will therefore obtain only nonsymmetric
ideal solutions of the TEP of degree 4, that is, solutions of the diophantine
system,

Till now, apart from numerical solutions [1, 14], parametric nonsymmet-
ric solutions of (3.1) in terms of polynomials of degrees 3 and 8 have been
published ([4], [5]). In this paper we obtain inﬁnitely many parametric so-
lutions of the diophantine system (3.1) in terms of polynomials of degree 2
as well as some multi-parameter solutions.

In both of the following subsections, we ﬁrst obtain a parametric solution

of the diophantine system,

(3.2)

X r

r = 1, 2, 3, 4,

and then choose the parameters so that we get a relation Xi = Yj for some
suitable i, j, and thus, we may cancel out these terms, and we then get a
solution of the diophantine system (3.1).

3.1

We will ﬁrst obtain a solution of the diophantine system (3.1) by ﬁnding
a solution of (1.1) with k = 2 taking the numbers xi as the terms of the
two arithmetic progressions [a, m1, d1] and [0, m2, d2] where d1 6= d2, and
the numbers yi as the terms of the arithmetic progression [b, n, d1]. As
the number of terms on either side of (1.1) must be the same, the integers
m1, m2 and n must satisfy the condition,

(3.3)

m1 + m2 = n.

The two equations of the diophantine system (1.1) are given by,

(3.4)

(3.5)

S1(a, m1, d1) + S1(0, m2, d2) = S1(b, n, d1),

S2(a, m1, d1) + S2(0, m2, d2) = S2(b, n, d1),

and, on using the the formulae (2.6) and (2.7), these equations may be
written as,

(3.6)

and

m1a = nb,

(3.7) 2m1a2 + (2/3)m1(4m2

1 + (2/3)m2(4m2

2 − 1)d2

2

= 2nb2 + (2/3)n(4n2 − 1)d2
1.

We now have to solve the simultaneous equations (3.3), (3.6) and (3.7).

The complete solution of (3.3) and (3.6) is given by,

(3.8)

a = (m1 + m2)r,

b = m1r, n = m1 + m2,

6

where r is an arbitrary rational parameter, and on substituting these values
of a, b and n in (3.7), we get a quadratic equation in d1, d2 and r whose
complete solution in rational numbers is readily obtained and is given by,
(3.9)

2 − 1)p2 − (8m2
2 − 1)p2 − (24m2

2 − 2)pq + (4m2
1 + 24m1m2 + 8m2

2 − 1)q2},
2 − 2)pq

1 + 12m1m2 + 4m2

d1 = −ρ{(12m2
d2 = ρ{(12m2

2 − 1)q2},
1 + 24m1m2 + 8m2

2 − 2)p2 − (8m2

2 − 2)q2},

where p and q are arbitrary integer parameters while ρ is an arbitrary
nonzero rational parameter.

We now have a solution of (1.1) with k = 2 in which the numbers xi
consist of two arithmetic progressions whose common diﬀerences are 2d1
and 2d2 while the numbers yi consist of the terms of a single arithmetic
progression whose common diﬀerence is 2d1. We now apply Lemma 1 twice,
in succession, taking h = 2d1 and 2d2 respectively, and obtain a solution of
the diophantine system (3.2) which is given by,

(3.10)

X1 = a1 − (2m1 − 1)d1,

X2 = a1 + (2m1 + 1)d1 + 2d2,

X3 = a2 − (2m2 − 1)d2,

X4 = a2 + (2m2 + 1)d2 + 2d1,

X5 = b1 + (2n + 1)d1,

X6 = b1 − (2n − 1)d1 + 2d2,

Y1 = a1 + (2m1 + 1)d1,

Y2 = a1 − (2m1 − 1)d1 + 2d2,

Y3 = a2 + (2m2 + 1)d2,

Y4 = a2 − (2m2 − 1)d2 + 2d1,

Y5 = b1 − (2n − 1)d1,

Y6 = b1 + (2n + 1)d1 + 2d2,

with the values of a, b, d1, d2 and n being given by (3.8) and (3.9) where
p, q, m1 and m2 are arbitrary parameters.

We can choose the parameters in the solution (3.10) of (3.2) in several
ways so that one pair of terms, one on each side of this solution of (3.2),
cancels out and we may thus obtain several solutions of (3.1). As an exam-
ple, on taking p = 2m2 + 1, q = 2m1 + 2m2 + 1, in the solution (3.10), we
get X6 = Y4, and we thus obtain a solution of (3.1) which is given in the
reduced form by

where m1 and m2 are arbitrary parameters. By successively assigning dis-
tinct ﬁxed numerical values to m2 in the above solution, we obtain inﬁnitely
many solutions of (3.1) in terms of polynomials of degree 2.

As a numerical example, taking m1 = 1, m2 = 1 in (3.11) and (3.12)

yields the following nonsymmetric ideal solution of the TEP of degree 4:

57, −22, 40, −61, −14

3.2

To ﬁnd a second solution of the diophantine system (3.1), we ﬁrst ﬁnd a
solution of (1.1) with k = 3 taking the numbers xi, yi as the terms of
six arithmetic progressions with the same common diﬀerence 2d. Speciﬁ-
cally, we take the numbers xi as the terms of the arithmetic progressions
[aj, nj, d], j = 1, 2, 3, and the numbers yi as the terms of the arithmetic
progressions [bj, nj, d], j = 1, 2, 3.

We now have to solve the following three equations obtained by taking

r = 1, 2 and 3 in (1.1), and using the formulae (2.6), (2.7) and (2.8):

becomes a perfect square. We must therefore choose ni, i = 1, 2, 3, such
that the function

(3.24) ψ(n1, n2, n3) = 3(n1 + n2 + n3)(n1 + n2 − n3)

× (−n1 + n2 + n3)(n1 − n2 + n3),

is a perfect square.

For ψ(n1, n2, n3) to be a perfect square, there must exist integers f and

g such that

(3.25) 3(n1 + n2 + n3)(n1 + n2 − n3)f 2 = (−n1 + n2 + n3)(n1 − n2 + n3)g2,

and it further follows that there must exist integers u and v such that

(3.26)

3f v(n1 + n2 − n3) = gu(n1 − n2 + n3),

(n1 + n2 + n3)f u = (−n1 + n2 + n3)gv.

On solving the two linear equations (3.26) for n1, n2, n3, we get,

(3.27)

n1 = f gu2 + (3f 2 − g2)uv − 3f gv2,
n2 = −(3f 2 + g2)uv,
n3 = −f g(u2 + 3v2).

where f, g, u and v are arbitrary parameters. We now substitute these
values of ni in Eq. (3.22) and then solve it to get the following solution for
a2 and a3:

a2 = (f u − gv)(−gu + 3f v){(3f 2 + 4f g − 3g2)u2+

(3.28)

(12f 2 − 24f g + 4g2)uv + (−27f 2 + 12f g + 3g2)v2},

a3 = 2(3f 2 + g2)(gu2 + 6f uv − 3gv2)(f u2 − 2guv − 3f v2).

Using (3.28) and the values of ni already obtained, we get the value of
a1 from (3.21), and ﬁnally, we obtain the values of b1 and b2 from (3.19).
These values of a1, b1, b2 are given by,

a1 = u{2f gu + (3f 2 − g2)v}{(3f 2 + g2)u2 + (12f 2 − 4g2)uv

− (27f 2 + 24f g + 9g2)v2},

(3.29)

b1 = v{(3f 2 − g2)u − 6f gv}{(9f 2 + 8f g + 3g2)u2

+ (12f 2 − 4g2)uv − (9f 2 + 3g2)v2},

b2 = (f u + gv)(gu + 3f v){(9f 2 − 4f g − g2)u2

+ (12f 2 − 24f g + 4g2)uv − (9f 2 + 12f g − 9g2)v2}.

We now have a solution of (1.1) with k = 3 and with the numbers xi, yi
consisting of three arithmetic progressions whose common diﬀerence is 2d.

10

We can thus apply Lemma 1 taking h = 2d to obtain the following solution
of (3.2):

(3.30)

Xi = ai − (2ni − 1)d,
Yi = ai + (2ni + 1)d,

Xi+3 = bi + (2ni + 1)d, i = 1, 2, 3,
Yi+3 = bi − (2ni − 1)d, i = 1, 2, 3,

where d is an arbitrary parameter, the values of n1, n2, n3, a1, a2, a3, b1, b2
are given in terms of arbitrary parameters f, g, u and v by (3.27), (3.28),
(3.29), and b3 = 0.

We note that, in the above solution, d occurs only in the ﬁrst degree.
To obtain ideal solutions of the TEP of degree 4, we simply choose d such
that two of the terms, one on each side, become equal, and thus they can be
cancelled out. We thus obtain a four-parameter ideal solution of the TEP of
degree 4. There are 36 ways to choose the pair of terms to be cancelled and
we can thus obtain several distinct four-parameter solutions of our problem.
The solutions obtained above are too cumbersome to be written down
explicitly. Accordingly we give below an example of just one nonsymmetric
solution obtained as described above by choosing d such that X1 = Y6
and then taking f = 2, g = 1. This solution of the diophantine system
(3.1) is in terms of two parameters u and v and denoting the polynomial
c0un + c1un−1v + c2un−2v2 + · · · + cnvn by [c0, c1, c2, . . . , cn], this two-
parameter solution may be expressed in reduced form as follows:
(3.31)
x1 = [−98, −1007, 1804, 687, 774],

x2 = [2, 858, −2396, −1518, 1314],

x3 = [−128, 308, 1404, 132, 144],

x4 = [122, 853, −1056, −753, −1206],

x5 = [102, −1012, 244, 1452, −1026],

y1 = [102, 1133, −2096, −693, 1314],

y2 = [122, −642, 1804, 1782, −1206],

y3 = [−128, −572, −56, 2772, 144],

y4 = [2, −407, 1404, −2013, −1026],

y5 = [−98, 488, −1056, −1848, 774].

As a numerical example, taking u = 2, v = −1 in (3.31) yields the

nonsymmetric solution,

easily if we impose the additional condition P3

The simultaneous diophantine equations (4.3) and (4.4) are solved very
i=1 yi, since on
taking x3 = −x1 − x2, y3 = −y1 − y2, both equations (4.3) and (4.4) reduce
to the single quadratic equation x2
2 whose
complete solution is readily obtained. It is more interesting to ﬁnd solutions
of Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4) together with the conditions,

Only a limited number of parametric solutions of this type, in terms of
polynomials of degrees 2 and 4, have been published ([2], [9, p. 711], [12, p.
49]).

In Section 4.1 we obtain parametric symmetric solutions of the dio-
phantine system (4.1) that yield much more general parametric solutions
of Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4) satisfying the conditions (4.5). In Section 4.2 we ob-
tain a parametric nonsymmetric solution of (4.1) and show how more such
solutions can be obtained.

4.1 Symmetric solutions of the TEP of degree 5

We will ﬁrst obtain numerical ideal symmetric solutions by directly solv-
ing equations (4.3) and (4.4) together with an additional condition namely,
the numbers xi, i = 1, 2, 3 are in arithmetic progression, and so also are
the numbers yi, i = 1, 2, 3. We will thereafter obtain two parametric ideal
symmetric solutions by the general method of ﬁrst ﬁnding a solution of the
diophantine system (1.1) such that xi, yi, i = 1, 2, . . . , s, are the terms of
arithmetic progressions.

4.1.1

To solve equations (4.3) and (4.4) directly, we write,

(4.6) x1 = a − d1, x2 = a, x3 = a + d1, y1 = b − d2, y2 = b, y3 = b + d2,

where a, b, d1, d2, are arbitrary parameters, and with these values, (4.3) and
(4.4) reduce to the two equations,

(4.7)

(4.8)

3a2 + 2d2
1 + 2d4

1 = 3b2 + 2d2
2,
1 = 3b4 + 12b2d2

2 + 2d4
2.

3a4 + 12a2d2

12

Now (4.7) may be written as 3(a − b)(a + b) = −2(d1 − d2)(d1 + d2), and

thus, its complete solution is readily obtained by writing,

(4.9) a − b = 2pr, 3(a + b) = 12qs, d1 − d2 = 2ps, −2(d1 + d2) = 12qr,

and is given by,

(4.10)

a = pr + 2qs, b = −pr + 2qs, d1 = ps − 3qr, d2 = −ps − 3qr.

where p, q, r and s are arbitrary parameters.

With these values of a, b, d1 and d2, (4.8) reduces, on transposing all

terms to one side and removing the factor 48pqrs, to

(4.11)

(2r2 − s2)p2 − (9r2 − 8s2)q2 = 0.

On writing p = qs2V /(2r2 − s2), r = sU , Eq. (4.11) reduces to the quartic
equation,

(4.12)

V 2 = 18U 4 − 25U 2 + 8.

Eq. (4.12) is a quartic model of an elliptic curve that reduces, under the
birational transformation,

(4.13)

U = (9X − Y − 104)/(11X − Y − 236),
V = (X 3 − 198X 2 + 916X + 980Y + 34336)/(11X − Y − 236)2,
X = 2(14U 2 − 17U + V + 4)/(U − 1)2,
Y = 2(36U 3 − 25U 2 + 11U V − 25U − 9V + 16)/(U − 1)3,

to the Weierstrass form of an elliptic curve given by

(4.14)

Y 2 = X 3 − X 2 − 784X + 8704.

It is readily determined using APECS (a software package written in
MAPLE for working with elliptic curves) that (4.14) is an elliptic curve of
rank 1, its Mordell-Weil basis being given by the rational point P with co-
ordinates (X, Y ) = (−8, 120). We can thus ﬁnd inﬁnitely many rational
points on the curve (4.14), and working backwards, we can ﬁnd inﬁnitely
many nontrivial solutions of the simultaneous equations (4.3) and (4.4),
and hence also of the simultaneous equations (4.1) and (4.2), in which the
integers xi, i = 1, 2, 3, and yi, i = 1, 2, 3, are in arithmetic progression.

While the rational point P on the elliptic curve (4.14) corresponds to a
trivial solution of the equations (4.3) and (4.4), the points 2P and 3P given
by (569/25, −5772/125) and (9121912/591361, 2979279240/454756609) re-
spectively, yield the following two nontrivial solutions of Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4):

(4.15)

(x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3) = (1965, 1121, 277, 1025, −477, −1979);

(4.16)

(x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3) = (−201642299, 47046243, 295734785,

299528843, 187147999, 74767155).

13

4.1.2

To obtain parametric ideal symmetric solutions of the TEP of degree 5,
we will ﬁrst ﬁnd a solution of (1.1) with k = 3 taking the numbers xi as
the terms of the two arithmetic progressions [aj, nj, d1], j = 1, 2, and the
numbers yi as the terms of the arithmetic progressions [bj, nj, d2], j = 1, 2.
We thus have to solve the following equations:

(4.17)

S1(a1, n1, d1) + S1(a2, n2, d1) = S1(b1, n1, d2) + S1(b2, n2, d2),

(4.18)

S2(a1, n1, d1) + S2(a2, n2, d1) = S2(b1, n1, d2) + S2(b2, n2, d2),

(4.19)

S3(a1, n1, d1) + S3(a2, n2, d1) = S3(b1, n1, d2) + S3(b2, n2, d2),

In addition, we impose the condition that

(4.20)

a1 + (2n1 − 1)d1 + 2d1 = a2 − (2n2 − 1)d1,

so that the numbers xi actually constitute just a single arithmetic progres-
sion with common diﬀerence 2d1.

The symmetric diophantine equations Eqs. (4.17), (4.18) are readily
solved together with the linear equation (4.20) and their solution is given
by,

(4.21)

a1 = 8n3
b1 = 8n3

b2 = 8tn3
d1 = −4n2
d2 = 4n2

2 + 8n3

2 − 2n1 − 2n2 + a2,

1n2 − 2t(3t − 4)n1n2
2 − 2n1 + (2t − 2)n2 + a2,

1n2 + 6t2n1n2

1 + 6t2n2
1 + 2t(3t − 4)n2

1 + 4(3t − 2)tn2
1 − (3t2 − 4)n1n2 − 4n2

2 + 1,
1 − (3t2 − 12t + 4)n1n2 + 4n2

2 − 1,

1n2 + 8tn1n2

2 − 2tn1 + a2,

where t is an arbitrary parameter.

On substituting the values of aj, bj, dj given by (4.21) in (4.19), we get

the following condition:

(4.22) 16n1n2(n1 + n2)t(t − 2)(2n1 + 2n2 + 1)(2n1 + 2n2 − 1)

× (4n2

1 + 6tn1n2 − 4n1n2 + 4n2

2 − 1)(n1 − n2)
1 + (3t2 − 4t + 4)n1n2 + (t − 1)(4n2

× {(4t − 4)n2

2 − 1)} = 0.

Equating to 0 any factor on the left-hand side of (4.22), except the last
two factors, leads to a trivial result. Equating to 0 the second last factor
of (4.22), we get n2 = n1, and we now have a solution of the diophantine
system (1.1) with k = 3, and on applying Lemma 1 twice in succession,
taking h = 2d1 and h = 2d2 respectively, we obtain a symmetric solution of
the diophantine system (4.1). This symmetric solution simpliﬁes further on

14

writing t = (2n1 − 1)p/(3n1q), and the reduced form of this solution may be
written as,

(4.23)

x1 = (2p2 + 6q2)n2
x2 = 2(p + q)(p − 3q)n2
x3 = 8pqn2
x4 = −x3,
y1 = (2p2 + 6q2)n2
y2 = 8pqn2
y3 = 2(p + q)(p − 3q)n2
y5 = −y2,
y4 = −y3,

x5 = −x2,

1 − (p2 + 6pq − 3q2)n1 − p2 − 3q2,

1 − (3p2 + 9q2)n1 + (p + q)(p − 3q),

1 + (p2 + 3q2)n1 − (p + 3q)(p − q),

x6 = −x1,

1 − 3(p + q)(p − 3q)n1 + p2 + 3q2,

1 − (p2 + 3q2)n1 + (p + q)(p − 3q),

1 − (p2 + 3q2)n1 − (p + 3q)(p − q),

y6 = −y1,

where n1, p and q are arbitrary parameters.

Next, we equate to 0 the last factor of (4.22) and to solve this quadratic
equation in n2, we equate its discriminant to a perfect square. We thus
obtain the following values of n1 and n2:

(4.24)

n1 = −8m(t − 1)(m2 − 9t4 + 24t3 + 24t2 − 96t + 48)−1,
n2 = −{m2 − (6t2 − 8t + 8)m + 3(t + 2)(3t − 2)(t − 2)2}

× (m2 − 9t4 + 24t3 + 24t2 − 96t + 48)−1,

where m is an arbitrary parameter.

We now have a second solution of the diophantine system (1.1) with
k = 3. We again apply Lemma 1 twice in succession, taking h = 2d1
and h = 2d2 respectively, and obtain another symmetric solution of the
diophantine system (4.1) which, expressed in reduced form, is given by,

(4.25)

x1 = 2m2 − 6t(t − 2)m + 6(t − 1)(t + 2)(3t − 2),
x2 = m2t + 16(t − 1)m − 3t(t + 2)(3t − 2),
x3 = (2t − 2)m2 − 2(3t2 − 4t + 4)m − 6(t + 2)(3t − 2),
x4 = −x3,
y1 = (2t − 2)m2 − 6t(t − 2)m + 6(t + 2)(3t − 2),
y2 = m2t − 16(t − 1)m − 3t(t + 2)(3t − 2),
y3 = 2m2 + 2(3t2 − 4t + 4)m − 6(t − 1)(t + 2)(3t − 2),
y4 = −y3,

x6 = −x1,

x5 = −x2,

y5 = −y2,

y6 = −y1,

where m and t are arbitrary parameters.

As a numerical example, taking m = 1, t = 3 in (4.25) yields the solution,

(4.26)

± 101, ±70, ±61

5
= ±49, ±86, ±95.

The solutions (4.23) and (4.25) of the diophantine system (4.1) immedi-
ately provide solutions of the simultaneous equations (4.3) and (4.4). These
solutions do not satisfy the conditions (4.5).

4.2 Nonsymmetric solutions of the TEP of degree 5

Apart from a ﬁnite number of numerical solutions, only one parametric
ideal nonsymmetric solution of the TEP of degree 5 in terms of polynomials
of degree 11 has been published [5]. We will now obtain such a parametric
ideal nonsymmetric solution in terms of polynomials of degree 10 and show
how inﬁnitely many nonsymmetric solutions of (4.1) may be obtained.

While we can obtain nonsymmetric solutions of (4.1) by our general
method, such solutions can also be obtained by imposing the condition that
the solution (3.30) of the diophantine system (3.2) also satisﬁes the relation,

Now (4.27) reduces to the following condition,

4d2 = (27f 4 − 14f 2g2 + 3g4)u4 − 32f g(3f 2 − g2)u3v

(4.28)

− (126f 4 − 108f 2g2 + 14g4)u2v2 + 96f g(3f 2 − g2)uv3
+ (243f 4 − 126f 2g2 + 27g4)v4.

The quartic function of u and v on the right-hand side of (4.28) becomes
a perfect square when u = ±v or u = ±3v. While these values of u and
v lead to trivial results, we can obtain inﬁnitely many values of u, v that
make the quartic function on the right-hand side of (4.28) a perfect square
by following the method described by Fermat [9, p. 639], one such solution
being u = −3(3f 2 − g2),
v = 3f 2 + 8f g − g2. With these values of u
and v, Eq. (4.28) can be solved to get a rational value of d, and we thus
obtain a nonsymmetric of (4.1) in terms of two arbitrary parameters f and
g. Denoting the polynomial c0f n + c1f n−1g + c2f n−2g2 + · · · + cngn by
[c0, c1, c2, . . . , cn], this two-parameter solution may be written in reduced
form as follows:

(4.29)

As a numerical example, taking f = 2, g = −1 in (4.29) yields the

solution,

= 65869, 21507, −98863, −100895, −8325, 120707.

As we can obtain inﬁnitely many values of u, v such that the quartic
function on the right-hand side of (4.28) becomes a perfect square, we can
obtain inﬁnitely many parametric nonsymmetric solutions of the TEP of
degree 5.

and we will show how more parametric solutions may be obtained. We note
that multi-parameter solutions of (5.1) have been given by Choudhry [3, p.
305] and Gloden [12, p. 43].

We ﬁrst ﬁnd a solution of (1.1) with k = 5 in which the numbers xi on
the left-hand side of (1.1) are the terms of the four arithmetic progressions
[a1, n1, d], [−a1, n1, d], [a2, n2, d] and [−a2, n2, d], while the numbers yi on
the right-hand side of (1.1) are the terms of the four arithmetic progressions
[b1, n1, d], [−b1, n1, d], [b2, n2, d] and [−b2, n2, d].

With the above choice of xi, yi, it is clear that (1.1) is identically true
for r = 1, 3 and 5. We thus have to solve just the following two equations
obtained by taking r = 2 and r = 4 in (1.1) respectively:

(5.2)

2n1a2

1 + 2n2a2

2 = 2n1b2

1 + 2n2b2

2 + {4n1(4n2

1 + 4n2(4n2
1 − 1)b2

2 − 1)a2
2}d2
1 + 4n2(4n2

= 2n1b4

Now (5.2) may be written as,

(5.4)

n1(a1 − b1)(a1 + b1) = −n2(a2 − b2)(a2 + b2),

and its complete solution obtained by writing,

(5.5)

n1(a1 − b1) = 2n1pr,

a1 + b1 = 2n2qs,

−n2(a2 − b2) = 2n2ps,

a2 + b2 = 2n1qr,

17

is given in terms of arbitrary parameters p, q, r, s by,

(5.6) a1 = pr + n2qs, a2 = −ps + n1qr, b1 = −pr + n2qs, b2 = ps + n1qr.

With these values of ai, bi, i = 1, 2, Eq. (5.3) reduces to the following

equation of degree two in r, s and d:

(5.7)

(p2 − n2

1q2)r2 − (p2 − n2

2q2)s2 + 4(n2

1 − n2

2)d2 = 0.

Now (5.7) has a solution r = 2, s = 2, d = q, and so its complete solution

is easily obtained, and is given by

(5.8)

r = 2(p2 − n2
s = −2(p2 − n2
d = −(p2 − n2

1q2)u2 − 4(p2 − n2
1q2)u2 − (p2 − n2
1q2)qu2 + (p2 − n2

2q2)uv + 2(p2 − n2
1q2)uv − 2(p2 − n2
2q2)qv2,

2q2)v2,
2q2)v2,

where u, v are arbitrary parameters.

Substituting the values of r and s given by (5.8) in (5.6), we get the
values of a1, a2, b1 and b2 in terms of the parameters p, q, n1, n2, u and v.
We now have a solution of (1.1) with k = 5, and on applying Lemma 1
taking h = 2d, we get a solution of the diophantine system (1.1) with k = 6
and s = 8 in terms of the parameters p, q, n1, n2, u and v. A pair of terms,
one on each side of this solution, cancels out if the following condition is
satisﬁed:

(5.9)

(p2 − n2

1q2){p + (n1 − n2)q}u2 − (2p3 − 2n2p2q − 2n2

2pq2

+ 2n2

1n2q3)uv + (p2 − n2

2q2){p − (n1 + n2)q}v2 = 0.

Taking p = −(n1 − n2)q, the coeﬃcient of u2 in (5.9) vanishes, and we
get u = n2
2, as a solution of (5.9), and ﬁnally
we obtain, after cancelling out a pair of terms, a symmetric solution of (5.1)
which may be written in the reduced form as follows:

1(n1 − 2n2), v = n3

We note that the condition (5.9) is a quadratic equation in u, v, and its
discriminant is a quartic function of p and q. We have already found one

18

set of values of p and q that make the discriminant a perfect square. Thus,
following the method described by Fermat [9, p. 639], we can ﬁnd inﬁnitely
many values of p, q such that the discriminant becomes a perfect square,
and hence we can obtain inﬁnitely many solutions of (5.9). We can thus
ﬁnd inﬁnitely many parametric ideal solutions of the TEP of degree 6.

As a numerical example, taking n1 = 3, n2 = 1 in (5.10) yields the

solution,

−66, −134, 133, 47, 8, 87, −75

Till now only one parametric solution of (6.1) has been published [2]. This
is a symmetric solution that satisﬁes the additional conditions,

x6 = −x3,

x7 = −x2,

x8 = −x1,

y5 = −y4,

y6 = −y3,

y7 = −y2,

y8 = −y1.

We obtain inﬁnitely many numerical solutions, as well as a parametric
solution of (6.1), and show how inﬁnitely many parametric solutions may be
obtained. All the solutions that we obtain are symmetric, and hence they
also provide solutions of the diophantine system,

In Section 4.1.1 we have described a method of obtaining inﬁnitely many
numerical solutions of the simultaneous equations (4.1) and (4.2) in which
the integers xi, i = 1, 2, 3, and the integers yi, i = 1, 2, 3, are the terms of
two arithmetic progressions with common diﬀerences d1 and d2 such that
d1 6= d2. Applying Lemma 1 twice, in succession, to such solutions taking
h = d1 and h = d2 respectively, immediately yields, on cancellation of com-
mon terms on either side, inﬁnitely many symmetric solutions of (6.1). As
an example, the two numerical solutions (4.15) and (4.16) yield the following
two solutions of (6.1):

(6.4)

± 448, ±677, ±1154, ±1569

6.2

We will now obtain a parametric solution of the diophantine system (6.1).
We ﬁrst ﬁnd a solution of (1.1) with k = 5 taking the numbers xi on the
left-hand side as the terms of the two arithmetic progressions [a, n, d1] and
[−a, n, d1] and the numbers yi as the terms of the two arithmetic progres-
sions [b, n, d2] and [−b, n, d2].

With the above values of xi, yi, it is clear that (1.1) is identically true
for r = 1, 3 and 5. We thus have to solve just the following two equations
obtained by taking r = 2 and r = 4 in (1.1) respectively:

2na2 + (2/3)n(4n2 − 1)d2

1 = 2nb2 + (2/3)n(4n2 − 1)d2
2,

(6.6)

and

(6.7) 2na4 + 4n(4n2 − 1)a2d2

1 + (2/15)n(4n2 − 1)(12n2 − 7)d4

1

= 2nb4 + 4n(4n2 − 1)b2d2

2 + (2/15)n(4n2 − 1)(12n2 − 7)d4
2.

Now (6.6) may be written as,

(6.8)

2n(a − b)(a + b) = −(2/3)n(2n − 1)(2n + 1)(d1 − d2)(d1 + d2),

and its complete solution obtained by writing,

(6.9)

a − b = 2(2n − 1)pr,

a + b = 2(2n + 1)qs,

−(d1 − d2)/3 = 2ps,

d1 + d2 = 2qr,

is given in terms of arbitrary parameters p, q, r, s by,

(6.10)

a = (2n − 1)pr + (2n + 1)qs,

b = −(2n − 1)pr + (2n + 1)qs,

d1 = −3ps + qr,

d2 = 3ps + qr.

Using these values of a, b, d1, and d2, (6.7) reduces, on removing the

factor pqrsn(2n − 1)(2n + 1), to the following equation:

(6.11) {5(2n − 1)2r2 − 9(4n2 + 1)s2}p2 − {(4n2 + 1)r2 − 5(2n + 1)2s2}q2 = 0.

Now (6.11) will have a rational solution for p and q if and only if the

following quartic function in r and s,

(6.12)

{5(2n − 1)2r2 − 9(4n2 + 1)s2}{(4n2 + 1)r2 − 5(2n + 1)2s2},

20

becomes a perfect square. We observe that the quartic function (6.12) does
become a perfect square when r = s. While this leads to a trivial solution,
we can use this solution to ﬁnd values of r and s that make the quartic
function (6.12) a perfect square by the method described by Fermat [9, p.
639]. We thus get,

(6.13)

r = −(4n2 + 9n + 1),

s = 4n2 + n + 1,

and with these values of r and s, Eq. (6.11) has the following solution:

(6.14)

p = 8n3 − 6n2 + 3n − 1,

q = −(8n3 − 14n2 − 7n + 1).

Substituting the values of p, q, r and s given by (6.13) and (6.14) in

Eq. (6.10), we obtain the following solution of equations (6.6) and (6.7):

(6.15)

a = −2n(16n4 − 17n2 − 3),
d1 = −16n4 − 47n2 − 1,

b = 48n4 + 17n2 − 1,
d2 = 32n4 − 26n2 + 2.

We now have a solution of (1.1) with k = 5 and on applying Lemma 1
twice in succession, taking h = 2d1 and h = 2d2 respectively, we get a
symmetric solution of the diophantine system (6.1). The reduced form of
this solution may be written as follows:

(6.16)

x1 = 16n4 − 64n3 − 13n2 − 4n + 1,
x2 = 32n5 − 16n4 + 30n3 + 13n2 − 2n − 1,
x3 = −32n5 + 16n4 + 26n3 − 15n2 − 2n − 1,
x4 = −32n5 − 32n4 + 26n3 − 32n2 − 2n,
x5 = −x4,
y1 = −32n5 + 32n4 + 26n3 + 32n2 − 2n,
y2 = −32n5 − 16n4 + 26n3 + 15n2 − 2n + 1,
y3 = 16n4 + 64n3 − 13n2 + 4n + 1,
y4 = 32n5 + 16n4 + 30n3 − 13n2 − 2n + 1,
y5 = −y4,

x7 = −x2,

x6 = −x3,

x8 = −x1,

y6 = −y3,

y7 = −y2,

y8 = −y1,

where n is an arbitrary parameter.

We note that the quartic function (6.12) can be made a perfect square
for inﬁnitely many values of r and s that may be obtained by repeated appli-
cation of Fermat’s method mentioned above. We can thus obtain inﬁnitely
many parametric ideal solutions of the TEP of degree 7.

As a numerical example, taking n = 2 in (6.16) yields the solution,

7 Some diophantine systems related to the Tarry-

Escott problem

In this Section we brieﬂy consider some diophantine systems that are
closely related to the TEP. We can obtain new solutions of several such
diophantine systems using the new approach to the TEP described in this
paper. We restrict ourselves to giving a few examples.

In this subsection, we consider the following diophantine system,

r = 1, 2, . . . , k, k + 2.

Xi=1

To obtain solutions of this diophantine system, we will use the following
theorem proved by Gloden. [12, p. 24]

Theorem 1. If there exist integers xi, yi, i = 1, 2, . . . , k + 1, such that the
relations (1.1) are satisﬁed with s = k + 1, then

where

xi! /(k + 1).

It is to be noted that Theorem 1 yields nontrivial solutions of the dio-
phantine system (7.1) only when we apply it to ideal nonsymmetric solutions.
We have already explicitly obtained two parametric ideal nonsymmetric
solutions of the TEP of degree 4, the ﬁrst solution being given by (3.11)and
(3.12) and the second one by (3.31). We further note that these solutions
are already in reduced form and thus each of them satisﬁes the additional
i=1 xi = 0. It now immediately follows from Theorem 1 that
these two parametric solutions as well as the numerical solutions (3.13) and
(3.32) also satisfy the diophantine system,

condition P5

Similarly, it follows from Theorem 1 that the parametric ideal nonsym-
metric solution of the TEP of degree 5 given by (4.29) and the numerical
solution (4.30) are also solutions of the diophantine system,

A detailed discussion of this diophantine system is given in [7] where it
is shown that for the existence of a nontrivial solution of the diophantine
system (7.6), it is necessary that s ≥ k + 2. Here we restrict ourselves to
ﬁnding solutions of the diophantine system (7.6) when (k, s) = (4, 6) and
also when (k, s) = (5, 7) by applying a lemma proved by Choudhry [7,
Lemma 3, pp. 766-767].

7.2.1

Applying the aforesaid lemma to either of the two solutions (3.10) and (3.30)
of the diophantine system (3.2), we immediately get two multi-parameter
solutions of (7.6) with (k, s) = (4, 6). As these solutions are cumbersome
to write, we omit writing them explicitly and give below just one three-
parameter solution derived from the solution (3.30) in which we have taken
u = 1, v = 1. This solution is as follows:

(7.7)

x1 = (6f 2 + 12f g + 6g2 + d)(−30f 2 + 4f g + 2g2 + d),
x2 = (−6f 2 + 4f g + 10g2 + d)(30f 2 − 4f g − 2g2 + d),
x3 = (18f 2 + 20f g + 2g2 + d)(−18f 2 + 12f g − 2g2 + d),
x4 = (6f 2 − 4f g − 10g2 + d)(18f 2 − 12f g + 2g2 + d),
x5 = (−6f 2 + 20f g − 6g2 + d)(−18f 2 − 20f g − 2g2 + d),
x6 = (6f 2 − 20f g + 6g2 + d)(−6f 2 − 12f g − 6g2 + d),
y1 = (−18f 2 + 12f g − 2g2 + d)(−6f 2 + 4f g + 10g2 + d),
y2 = (6f 2 − 20f g + 6g2 + d)(18f 2 + 20f g + 2g2 + d),
y3 = (−6f 2 + 20f g − 6g2 + d)(6f 2 + 12f g + 6g2 + d),
y4 = (30f 2 − 4f g − 2g2 + d)(−6f 2 − 12f g − 6g2 + d),
y5 = (−30f 2 + 4f g + 2g2 + d)(6f 2 − 4f g − 10g2 + d),
y6 = (18f 2 − 12f g + 2g2 + d)(−18f 2 − 20f g − 2g2 + d),

where f, g and d are arbitrary parameters. While this solution is of degree
2 in the parameter d, a solution of degree 4 has been published earlier [7].
As a numerical example, taking f = 2, g = 1, d = 1 in (7.7), we get the

23

solution,

5995, 555, 5635, −357, 1243, −477

5995.555.5635.(−357).1243.(−477) = (−245).1035.(−605).5883.763.5763.

7.2.2

We will now solve the diophantine system (7.6) when (k, s) = (5, 7).

We will ﬁrst ﬁnd a solution of the diophantine system (1.1) with k = 2
and s = 2m1 + 2m2 = 2n, taking the numbers xi as the terms of two
arithmetic progressions [aj, mj, dj], j = 1, 2, and the the numbers yi as
the terms of the arithmetic progression [0, n, d3], where d1, d2 and d3 are
distinct rational numbers. We now have to solve the following two equations
obtained by taking r = 1 and r = 2 respectively in (1.1):

(7.8)

m1a1 + n2m2 = 0,

(7.9) m1a2

2 − 1)d2

2/3

1 + m1(4m2

1 − 1)d2

1/3 + m2a2

2 + m2(4m2

= n(4n2 − 1)d2

3/3.

In addition, we impose the following auxiliary conditions so that when we
apply Lemma 1 with h = 2d3 to the solution of the diophantine system (1.1)
that is being obtained, the resulting solution of (1.1) with k = 3 will consist
of the terms of just four arithmetic progressions.

(7.10)

(7.11)

(2n + 1)d3 − {a1 + (2m1 − 1)d1} = 2d1,

a2 − (2m2 − 1)d2 + 2d3 + (2n − 1)d3 = 2d2.

We now solve the four equations (7.8), (7.9), (7.10), (7.11) for a1, a2, d1,
d2 and d3, and to the resulting solution of (1.1) with k = 2, we apply
Lemma 1 three times in succession, taking h = 2d3, h = 2d1 and h = 2d2
respectively, and thus obtain, after cancellation of common terms, a solution
of (1.1) with k = 5 and s = 8. On taking n1 = −3/4, two more terms - one
from each side - cancel out, and we obtain a solution of (1.1) with k = 5
and s = 7.

We now apply the aforesaid lemma proved by Choudhry [7, Lemma 3,
pp. 766-767] to obtain a solution of the diophantine system (7.6) with k = 5
and s = 7 in terms of the parameter m2. On replacing m2 by m, this solution
may be written as follows:

x1 = (4m + 3)(8m − 3),

x2 = −2(2m + 3)(12m − 1),

x3 = −4(3m + 1)(4m − 9),

x4 = 6(4m + 1)(8m + 1),

x5 = 3(4m + 1)(16m − 3),

x6 = 8(4m + 3)(m − 1),

(7.12)

x7 = −4(16m + 9)(2m − 1),

y1 = 8m + 1)(4m − 9),

y2 = (16m + 9)(12m − 1),

y3 = 4(2m + 3)(4m + 3),

y4 = 8(3m + 1)(8m − 3),

y5 = −6(4m + 1)(2m − 1),

y6 = −2(4m + 1)(16m − 3),

y7 = −12(4m + 3)(m − 1).

8 Concluding Remarks

In this paper we have described a new method to derive solutions of
the TEP, and obtained several new parametric ideal solutions of the TEP of
degree ≤ 7. The method can be applied to obtain many other new solutions
of the TEP and related diophantine systems. It may be possible to apply the
method described in this paper to obtain the complete ideal solution of the
TEP of degrees 4 and 5 but we leave this as an open problem. Similarly it is
perhaps possible to apply this method to obtain parametric ideal solutions
of the TEP of degrees ≥ 8 but this is also left for future investigations.
