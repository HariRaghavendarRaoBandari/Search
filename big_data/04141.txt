The second-order Green’s function method (GF2) was shown recently to be an accurate self-
consistent approach for electronic structure of correlated systems since the self-energy accounts for
both the weak and some of the strong correlation. The numerical scaling of GF2 is quite steep
however, O(N 5) (where the pre-factor is often hundreds), eﬀectively preventing its application to
large systems. Here, we develop a stochastic approach to GF2 (sGF2) where the self-energy is
evaluated by a random-vector decomposition of Green’s functions so that the dominant part of
the calculation scales quasi linearly with system size. A study of hydrogen chains shows that the
resulting approach is numerically eﬃcient and accurate, as the stochastic errors are very small, 0.05%
of the correlation energy for large systems with only a moderate computational eﬀort. The method
also yields automatically eﬃcient MP2 energies and is automatically temperature dependent.

Second-order Green’s function (GF2) is a temperature
dependent self-consistent perturbation approach where
the Green’s function is iteratively renormalized. Thus,
at self-consistency the self-energy which accounts for
the many-body correlation eﬀects is a functional of the
Green’s function, Σ(G). Upon convergence the method
includes all second order skeleton diagrams dressed with
the renormalized second order Green’s function propa-
gators, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Speciﬁcally, as shown
in Ref. 1, GF2, which at convergence is reference in-
dependent, preserves the desirable features of Møller-
Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) while avoiding the
divergences that appear when static correlation is im-
portant. Additionally, GF2 possesses only a very small
fractional charge and spin error,2 less than either typical
hybrid density functionals or RPA with exchange, there-

fore having a minimal self-interaction error.
GF2 describes metallic, insulating, and Mott regimes and
recovers the internal energy for multiple phases present
in a solid. Moreover, GF2 is useful for eﬃcient Green’s
function embedding techniques such as in the self-energy
embedding method (SEET).4,5

While GF2 has these formal advantages, it is quite
expensive and can be easily applied only to small systems
with up to a few hundred atomic orbitals (AOs). This is
because the calculation of the self-energy matrix scales as
O(nτ N 5), where nτ is the size of the imaginary time grid
and N the number of AOs. Here, we therefore develop a
statistical formulation which converts the many-indices
summation inherent in the self-energy matrix to a quasi
linearly-scaling approach.

The present development is in the same spirit as our
previous work on several electronic structure methods,
including MP2,6,7 RPA,8 DFT,9,10 DFT with long-range
exact exchange,11 TDDFT,12 and GW.13 Among these,
the closest to this work are the stochastic version of
MP2 in real-time plane-waves,7 and MO-based MP2 with
Gaussian basis sets.6 The present stochastic temperature
dependent MP2 and GF2 are based on a primary ingredi-
ent, the imaginary-time Green’s function in an AO basis,

which is attractive for stochastic simulations since it is
smooth and varies continuously with parameter changes.
We also note other works which use stochastic sam-
pling of perturbative quantum chemistry expressions, in-
cluding for example perturbative stochastic approaches14
which employs diﬀerent sampling schemes than ours, and
a stochastic coupled clusters algorithm (CC).15

The correlated Green’s function is

G(iωn) =(cid:2)[G0(iωn)]−1 − Σ(iωn)(cid:3)−1

with G0(iωn) = (cid:2)(µ + iωn)S − F(cid:3)−1

, where S and F
are overlap and Fock matrices in the non-orthogonal
AO basis and µ is the chemical potential. The Mat-
subara frequencies ωn = (2n + 1)π/β form a numeri-
cal grid where β is the inverse temperature and n is
a non-negative integer. Recall that the relation be-
tween quantities in Matsubara frequencies and imagi-
´
nary time is analogous to the relation between real-

frequencies and time,

feature is that G(τ ) is a smooth function of τ . For ex-
ample, G0(τ ) has a form

β Re(cid:80)n e−iωnτ G(iωn). Further, an important

i.e., G(iωn) =

G0(τ ) =

,

(2)

where ˜F is the Fock matrix in an orthogonal basis and the
resulting G0(τ ) can be transformed to a non-orthogonal
AO basis if desired. Thus, G0(τ ) and G(τ ) do not have
the oscillations of real-time Green’s functions, and this is
especially important for the stochastic numerics below.

The Green’s function is iteratively improved by updat-
ing the Fock-matrix F and the second order self-energy
Σ(iωn) that describes the correlation eﬀects. In GF2, the
self-energy is

where the curly brackets refer to a stochastic average
constructed using random vectors. Here, we construct
these vectors in the most symmetric way possible, i.e.,
based on a square-root-like decomposition of the real-
symmetric matrix G(τ ):

where we introduced the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
of the Green’s function, G(τ ) = A(τ )g(τ )AT (τ ), while
η0(τ ) is a completely random vector, i.e., η0
j (τ ) = ±1 for
j = 1, ..., N . It is straightforward to prove Eq. 6 based

l (τ )(cid:9) = δkl.

Gpq(β − τ ) = (cid:8)ξp(β − τ ) ¯ξq(β − τ )(cid:9). The self-energy

matrix becomes then an average over a separable prod-
uct:

Σij(τ ) =(cid:8)¯ui(τ )(2uj(τ ) − wj(τ ))(cid:9),

where formally ui(τ ) =(cid:80)kmq ηk(τ )ζm(τ )ξq(β − τ )vikmq

with analogous expressions for ¯u, w (see below).
It is
eﬃcient to evaluate these summations on a grid, i.e., we
deﬁne a time- and space-dependent random function on
a grid

(9)

η(r, τ ) =(cid:88)l

ηl(τ )φl(r),

(10)

with similar expressions for ζ(r, τ ), ξ(r, τ ), etc.
(The
computation of these functions is linear in system size
since the AO functions are local.) We then write the
vectors decomposing Σ(τ ) as convolution integrals:

¨
uj(τ ) = (φjη(τ )|ζ(τ )ξ(β − τ ))
≡

φi(r)η(r, τ )||r − r(cid:48)|−1ζ(r(cid:48),τ )ξ(r(cid:48), β − τ )drdr(cid:48),

(11)

and analogously wj(τ ) = (φjξ(β − τ )|ζ(τ )η(τ )), ¯uj(τ ) =
(φj ¯η(τ )|¯ζ(τ ) ¯ξ(β − τ )). Therefore, the expensive sum-
mation over many indices is replaced by averaging over
convolution integrals, each of which scales quasi-linearly
with system size.

In passing, we note that the formalism is completely
robust to near-degeneracies in the basis due to the trans-
formations in Eqs. 7,8. This is in contrast to other for-
mally simpler stochastic evaluations of the self-energy,
e.g., choosing randomly all the non−ij indices in Eq.3.

Typically, in the ﬁrst iteration we obtain the density
matrix P from a Hartree-Fock (HF) solution; however,
at convergence due to the iterations GF2 is formally ref-
erence independent, so the initial Fock-matrix can be
DFT-based. Beyond the ﬁrst iteration, the density ma-
trix is evaluated using the correlated Green’s function as
P = 2
G(iωn) from which one constructs the
Fock matrix.

Given the initial density matrix and Fock matrix, one
iteratively constructs (until self-consistency is reached)
self-energy matrices Σ(iωn) and Σ∞, and the correlated
Green’s function, density and Fock matrices. The chem-
ical potential µ is adjusted at each stage so that Tr(P S)
yields the correct number of electrons, Ne.

In GF2, both the Green’s function and self-energy
are smooth functions of the imaginary time and fre-
quency. At each stage, G(iωn) is calculated and trans-
formed to yield G(τ ), which is used to make the time-
dependent self-energy Σ(τ ) which is then transformed
to give Σ(iωn). For computational eﬃciency, we use
a non-equidistant spline grid16 sampling the Matsubara
frequencies. In the time domain, Σ(τ ) is expressed in an
orthogonal polynomial basis.17

nation of the time-dependent self-energy (Eq. 3), where,
heuristically, two 4-index tensors are connected through
three matrices. To reduce the scaling we turn to the

details. To study the performance of
stochastic GF2 we used typical model systems, ﬁnite
(non-periodic) chains of hydrogen atoms spaced 1 ˚A
apart with N =30, 100, 300 and 1000. A minimal STO-
3G basis set was used so N = Ne. A numerical grid con-
tained up to 10×10×4000 points with a 0.5 bohr spac-
ing was suﬃcient for converging Eq. 11. The convolu-
tion integrals employed the usual numerical-analytical
splitting18 which uses here grid-doubled integration due
to the lack of periodicity in any dimension. The inverse
temperature was set at β = 50 1/a.u. and a Chebyshev-
type imaginary-time grid17 with 128 time points was em-
ployed. As mentioned, a spline-ﬁt method was used16 for
the frequency-to-time conversions of G(iωn) and Σ(iωn)
and for the evaluation of the two-body energy.

The completely-random vectors (η0,ζ 0, ξ0) were dif-
ferent at each time point τ but did not change with
the self-consistent GF2 iterations. A key for the self-
consistency convergence was DIIS (direct inversion of the
iterative subspace).19,20 After each iteration a combined
vector made from the τ -dependent self-energy Σ(τ ) and
the Fock matrix (weighted by a factor, typically 3.0) was
fed into a general DIIS routine that held in memory the
4 previous iterations and updated the combined vector.
The simulations started with Hartree-Fock densities, and
about 12 iterations were required for the DIIS conver-
gence to an error which was much smaller than the statis-
tical (sampling) error. The number of stochastic samples,
NM C, ranged between 50 and 800, and the results were
averaged over several simulations starting from diﬀerent
random numbers.

Temperature-dependent MP2. The ﬁrst SGF2 iteration
yields the MP2 correlation energy (Eq. 5) which follows
a Gaussian distribution as illustrated in Fig. 2. Table I
shows the correlation energy Ecorr and the (stochastic)
error δEcorr for chains with various number of orbitals.
Even for N = 1000, the stochastic error is only 0.058% of
the total correlation energy. For perspective, note that
(deterministic) errors of larger or similar magnitude are
present in local or divide and conquer MP2 methods with
density ﬁtting21,22.
Stochastic GF2.

In sGF2, due to the iterations, the
dependence of the energy on the Green function, which
depends itself on the number (NM C) of stochastic sam-
pling of Eq.9, leads to an additional non-stochastic (bias)
dependence on NM C. (Simply put, averaging a mil-
lion sGF2 calculations each with 100 stochastic sam-
ples will give diﬀerent results than averaging 100 sim-
ulations which each uses a million samples, unlike in
sMP2.) Mathematically, the energy in any speciﬁc sim-
ulation with NM C samplings is then approximately E =
E(NM C) + r(NM C)− 1
2 δ, where E(NM C) is a bias-type
component, r is a random scale-less variable, and δ is ap-
proximately independent of NM C. Speciﬁcally, as seen in
Figs. 3 and 4, the energies for diﬀerent NM C are stochas-
tically distributed around a line E(NM C). We found ex-
cellent ﬁt to an empirical formula

E(NM C) − EHF = Ecorr + b(NM C)− 4

energies for diﬀerent NM C for hydrogen chain with N=100.

i.e., the stochastic calculated energies cluster near the
line deﬁned by this formula. We therefore ﬁt, for any
given system, the values of b, and Ecorr that yield the
best ﬁt to the actual calculated data. The ﬁtted value
of Ecorr is the GF2 prediction for the correlation energy.
Note that an alternative is to reduce the dependence of
the curve (i.e., to ﬂatten the E(NM C) bias-dependence
on NM C) by employing in Eq. 4 Green’s functions and
self-energies that come from diﬀerent sets of stochastic
runs, in the spirit of “jackknife” analysis23.

The sGF2 results, summarized in Table I, show that
the self-consistent iterations that are inherent in GF2
do not destroy the convergence of the method. Further,
in large systems the GF2 correlation reduces the spatial
extent of Σ∞ so the statistical error even decreases rel-
ative to sMP2. The statistical error in the total energy
would have grown as √N if the system was made from
completely isolated non-interacting fragments, and the
results here overall follow this trend.

stochastic GF2 errors are well controlled and highly ac-
curate correlation energies with only a 0.05% stochastic
error are reached with reasonable computational eﬀort.
These errors are comparable with errors of local MP2
approaches used in quantum chemistry. The present cal-
culations are among the ﬁrst applications of fully self-
consistent Green’s function method with full imaginary
frequency dependence to large systems described by a full
quantum chemistry Hamiltonian. Moreover, we demon-
strated that the splitting of matrices by a random av-
erage over stochastically chosen vectors leads to a small
variance and that relatively few Monte Carlo samples
already yield quite accurate correlation energies. The
reason for this is two-fold: the stochastic sampling inher-
ently acts only in the space of orbitals but the actual spa-
tial integrals (Eq. 11) are evaluated exactly; in addition,
since the Green’s function matrices are smooth in imagi-
nary time, diﬀerent random vectors can be used at each
imaginary-time point thereby enhancing the stochastic
sampling eﬃciency.

There are many possible applications and extensions
of the approach studied here. sGF2 is potentially suit-
able for calculating energy diﬀerences between neighbor-
ing conﬁgurations because the underlying stochastic vec-
tors are chosen automatically in the AO space so they are
continuous with a change of the system parameters; this
is in contrast with our previous stochastic MP2 basis in
Gaussian basis study6 where the stochastic vectors were
chosen in the MO space so they were not continuous with
change of parameters.

Further, the present stochastic GF2 and MP2 methods
are automatically suitable for periodic systems, as all the
deterministic steps (i.e., Eq. 1) and the time-frequency
transforms are very eﬃcient when done in the reciprocal
(k) space. The only caveat is that in periodic systems
one needs to choose the random vectors to be in k-space
and then to convert them to real-space, as detailed in an
upcoming article.

Finally, we also note that, beyond the results presented
here, it should also be possible to achieve further reduc-
tion of the stochastic error with an embedded fragment
approach similar to self-energy embedding approaches
where a deterministic self-energy is embedded into the

TABLE I. Stochastic GF2 and MP2 correlation energies in
Hartree using 4000 total Monte Carlo runs (composed of sev-
eral sets of runs with diﬀerent values of NM C ) for diﬀerent
number of orbitals in hydrogen chains. For each system, an
empirical formula E − EHF = Ecorr + b (NM C )
3 was ﬁt-
ted to the calculated energies, so Ecorr is the predicted GF2
correlation energy.

system size (Ne = 1000), 6500 core hours on standard
2Gﬂops CPUs, and the method is fully parallelized. The
temperature-dependent MP2 evaluations only require the
ﬁrst (of twelve) SCF iterations so they took only 500 CPU
core hours for the largest system. The calculation times
are dominated by the stochastic evaluation of the self-
energy which rises linearly with system size. For ﬁnite
systems beyond ≈ 5000 orbitals the quadraticly and cu-
bicly rising parts in the non-stochastic GF2 parts (e.g.,
inversion and diagonalization of the Green’s functions,
etc.) would start dominating the scaling.

In conclusion, we presented an sGF2 algorithm and
evaluated electronic correlation energies for prototypi-
cal hydrogen chain systems. We demonstrated that the
