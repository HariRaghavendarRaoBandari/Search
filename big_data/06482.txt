Abstract

In a type I Dirac or Weyl semimetal, the low energy states are squeezed to a single

point in momentum space when the chemical potential µ is tuned precisely to the

Dirac/Weyl point. Recently, a type II Weyl semimetal was predicted to exist, where

the Weyl states connect hole and electron bands, separated by an indirect gap. This

leads to unusual energy states, where hole and electron pockets touch at the Weyl

point. Here we present the discovery of a type II topological Weyl semimetal (TWS)
state in pure MoTe2, where two sets of WPs (W ±
of electron and hole pockets and are located at diﬀerent binding energies above EF .

3 ) exist at the touching points

2 , W ±

Using ARPES, modeling, DFT and calculations of Berry curvature, we identify the

Weyl points and demonstrate that they are connected by diﬀerent sets of Fermi arcs

for each of the two surface terminations. We also ﬁnd new surface “track states” that

form closed loops and are unique to type II Weyl semimetals. This material provides

an exciting, new platform to study the properties of Weyl fermions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

It is quite surprising and yet exhilarating that non-interacting or quadratic Hamiltonians

can continue to provide so much richness from graphene, to topological insulators and topo-

logical superconductors. This list was recently expanded by discovery of topological Weyl

semimetals (TWS), the relatively robust three-dimensional analogs of graphene. With all

three Pauli matrices involved in the Hamiltonian, perturbations only shift the position of

the node in momentum space but do not open a gap.

While the massless solution to the Dirac equation1 was ﬁrst proposed by Hermann Weyl in

1929, there are no known examples of Weyl fermions in particle physics. Quantum materials’

analogs have been proposed in various classes of topological Dirac and Weyl semi-metals2–5

where a pair of Dirac nodes can be separated into two Weyl points (WPs) by breaking either

inversion or time reversal invariance. The topological nature of a TWS is reﬂected in the

Berry ﬂuxes of opposite chirality circulating around the WPs and the presence of a Fermi

arc formed between the projections of the two Weyl points on a surface at which the bulk

is truncated.

Recently, two types of TWS have been identiﬁed: Type I TWS can be understood as

the limiting point of a semiconductor with a direct band gap that closes linearly at a set of

isolated points. As a consequence, there is zero density of states if the chemical potential is

tuned to the energy of the WPs. Type I TWS have been observed in the TaAs family (TaAs,

NbAs and TaP)6–8, and also predicted to occur in pyrochlore iridates9–11. Type II TWS, on

the other hand, can be understood as the limiting point of an indirect gap semiconductor

that evolves into a compensated semi-metal with electron and hole pockets that touch at a

set of isolated points with a ﬁnite density of states at the chemical potential. The two WPs

connected by a Fermi arc need not occur at the same energy. MoTe2, WTe2 and SrSi2 are

predicted to be such a type II TWS12–14. There are some signatures of such a state in mixed

compound Mo0.45W0.55Te2

15. Here we present the ﬁrst evidence for type II Weyl semimetal

behavior in the stochiometric, low scattering material such as MoTe2.

One of the most exciting properties of a TWS is the existence of gapless Fermi arcs on

the surface. A Fermi surface, deﬁned as the locus of gapless excitations, is typically a closed

contour that separates ﬁlled states from empty states at zero temperature. In view of that, a

chopped up Fermi surface with the two pieces on opposite surfaces is a novel state of matter.

Surface sensitive probes such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy have a decided

advantage in investigating the structure of arcs, connectivity of electron and hole pockets

and locations of Weyl points, which is the topic of our paper.

II. MODEL FOR TYPE II TWS

To set the stage for interpretation of the experimental results, we investigate a two-

band lattice model which breaks inversion symmetry but is invariant under time-reversal

symmetry. The main lessons learned by examining this model are shown in Fig. 1 and

summarized here: (1) The minimum number of four Weyl nodes in this type II TWS occur

at E = 0 at the touching point of electron and hole pockets in contrast with a type I TWS

that has a zero density of states at E = 0. The touching of electron and hole bands in our

model is similar to the touching of the electron and hole bands in the experimental data

shown in Fig. 2a and b. (2) For a slab geometry, constant energy cuts at E = 0 show

Fermi arcs on surface termination A and B that connect Weyl points of opposite chirality.

In addition there are what we term “track states” that exist on the surface and pass through

the WPs but, unlike Fermi arcs, form closed loops. For E < 0, the projections of the WPs

are within the hole pocket, and at the surface the arc states connect the two hole pockets

and the track states loop around the electron pockets. The opposite is true for E > 0.

(3) The energy dispersion clearly shows a surface state dispersing separately from the bulk

bands and merging with the bulk bands close to the WP in Fig. 1d. This is corroborated by

the experimental data around the Weyl nodes in Fig. 2i and Fig. 3n where the arc merges

with the bulk states.

We consider the following Hamiltonian for a two-band lattice model which breaks inver-

sion symmetry and is invariant under time-reversal:

where ˆc(†)

kα annihilates (creates) an electron at momentum k in orbital α and

ˆH(k) = γ(cos(2kx) − cos(k0))(cos(kz) − cos(k0))ˆσ0

− (m(1 − cos2(kz) − cos(ky)) + 2tx(cos(kx) − cos(k0)))ˆσ1

− 2t sin(ky)ˆσ2 − 2t cos(kz)ˆσ3.

(2)

Here ˆσi is the i-th Pauli matrix for i = 1, 2, 3 and ˆσ0 is the 2 × 2 identity matrix.
This model has four Weyl nodes located at E = 0 and k = (±k0, 0,±π/2). The term in
ˆH(k) proportional to ˆσ0 produces a uniform shift in both energy bands. Such a momentum-
dependent shift will result in a non-vanishing density of states from electron and hole pockets

which touch at the Weyl node and a tilt of the Weyl nodes characteristic of a type II TWS.

Henceforth, we set the parameters m = 2t, tx = t/2, k0 = π/2, and γ = 2.4t. The bulk band

structure for this parameter choice can be seen in Fig. 1a which shows hole and electron

pockets touching at the Weyl nodes as well as pockets disconnected from the nodes. Similar

Fermiology is also present in the MoTe2 system and we can gain insight into this and other

related materials by taking advantage of the lattice model’s simplicity and tunability.

We examine the structure of the surface state conﬁguration by considering the model in

Eq. (1) in a slab geometry ﬁnite in the y- direction with L layers but inﬁnite in the x- and

z-directions. We label the states as “surface termination B” (“surface termination A”) if
they are exponentially localized at (cid:104)y(cid:105) = 1 ((cid:104)y(cid:105) = L). Fig. 1 also shows the surface states
at µ = ±0.1t overlaid on the bulk band structure. We show constant energy cuts through
the band structure of the slab geometry in Fig. 1b and c for µ = ±0.1t. When µ < 0, the
projections of the Weyl nodes (shown by green dots) are enclosed by hole pockets. Each of

these hole pockets are connected to another pocket containing a node of opposite chirality

by one Fermi arc on surface A (B) shown as a thick light red (blue) line. When µ > 0, the

projections of the Weyl nodes are enclosed by electron pockets which are similarly connected

by Fermi arcs on the surfaces. At precisely µ = 0, because all of the nodes lie at E = 0, all

Fermi arcs terminate on the nodes themselves as in a type I TWS.

The slab conﬁguration energy dispersion for ﬁxed kx is shown in Fig. 1d and 1e. These

cuts are shown as green dashed lines labeled cut 1 and cut 2 respectively. We can see that at

the Weyl nodes, the red surface bands in 1d disappear into the bulk. As we move past the

Weyl points in e, we see that these two red bands combine into a single continuous band.

III. ARPES RESULTS

MoTe2 is a semimetal that crystallizes in a orthorhombic lattice. The Fermi surface of

MoTe2 also has two 2-fold symmetry axes, along Γ - X and Γ - Y directions. The lattice
constants are a = 6.33 ˚A, b = 3.469 ˚A. Due to breaking of the inversion symmetry there are

two diﬀerent possible terminations of the cleaved sample surface, referred to as termination

“A” and “B” respectively. The two diﬀerent terminations also have diﬀerent surface band

structures as seen by laser-based angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and

corroborated by DFT calculations.

We identify electron and hole bands in the spectroscopic data shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

The hole bands at the center of the Brillouin zone have a “butterﬂy” shape. The electron

pockets shaped like ovals are located on each side of the butterﬂy. There are also two banana

like hole pockets partially overlapping the oval electron pockets. The conﬁguration of these

pockets can be seen at the Fermi energy in Fig. 2a and 10 meV above the Fermi energy in

Fig. 2b and their electron or hole character is easily identiﬁed because hole (electron) pockets

shrink (expand) with increasing energy. A simpliﬁed sketch of constant energy contours of

electron and hole bands is shown in Fig. 2c.

The central hole pocket touches the electron pockets at four Weyl points shown as red

dots in Fig. 2a-c which we label as W2. The outer banana shaped hole pockets also touch

the oval electron pockets at two other Weyl points labeled as W3. At surface termination

A, Fig. 2b, those two types of Weyl points are connected by topological arcs seen as white-

gray high intensity areas. For this surface termination there is no strong evidence for arcs

connecting positive and negative chirality W2 nor positive and negative chirality W3 points.

The situation for surface termination B is more complicated as shown in Fig. 2d. There

seems to be a sharp contour connecting both sets of W2 and W3 points. Most likely this is a

track state discussed above. The examination of constant energy plot at energy of 30 meV

below EF (Fig 2e), reveals that there are actually two bands present. In addition to the track

state, there is also an arc present that connects positive and negative chirality W2 points.

Although present data does not allow us to deﬁnitely demonstrate a connection between

positive and negative chirality W3 points, we can deduce that they are likely connected, so

form a closed loop when connected via the bulk of the sample.

We now examine the locations of the Weyl points in the band dispersion. In Fig. 2f-i we

plot the band dispersion along ky cut for selected values of kx. At ky=0.36 π/b (panel f) two

bands are clearly visible: an “M” shaped band at higher binding energy and a “U” shaped

band at slightly lower binding energy. Both bands appear connected at zero momentum with

Dirac-like structure. As we move towards the zone center, both bands move to lower binding

energy and their energy separation decreases. In panel h, the tips of the “M” shaped band

(red dotted line) touches the EF and form parts of the butterﬂy hole pockets. As these tips

move above EF , they touch merge with wings of the “U” shaped electron band (white dotted

line) forming two Weyl points approximately 20 meV above EF marked by black dots. At

each side of the symmetry line, they form two tilted cones characteristic of a type II Weyl

node. The data along kx direction are shown in Fig. 3d-o along with results of calculations

(Fig. 3p-w) for the two surface terminations. The surface termination A is characterized

by lower binding energy of electron pocket in panels d-g, when compared to the data from

surface termination B shown in panels h-k and l-o. The data in panels l-o best illustrates the

formation of the W2 points. In panel l, the hole band is marked with red dashed line, while

the electron band is marked with white dashed line. As we move away from the symmetry

line, the separation between those bands becomes smaller and they merge at a point located
∼20 meV above EF marked by red dot in panel n. For higher values of ky momentum
they separate again as seen in panel o. The DFT calculation also demonstrates the energy

diﬀerence of the band locations for the two terminations and formation of the W2 Weyl point

that agrees with experiment on a qualitative level.

The momentum location of the experimentally determined Weyl points is somewhat dif-

ferent from DFT predictions (marked as pink dots in 2a,b) most likely due to high sensitivity

of the band calculation to structural parameters. Table I summarizes the positions of WPs

determined from experiment and DFT. Despite the discrepancy between the predicted loca-

tions of the Weyl nodes from DFT and where they are located experimentally, in each case

they are at the touching points of the electron and hole bands. In the ky = 0 cuts shown in

Fig. 3d,h,l,p,t, band 1 is connected to bulk states below the Fermi level, while band 3 dips

down and goes into bulk just before it reaches the Weyl point. As we increase ky, band 1

and band 3 merge together. In the ky = 0.1π/a cuts, the two bands merge into one band

which goes through the position of the projection of W2. This behavior is exactly the the

behavior predicted in Fig. 1d and 1e.

IV. DFT AND TOPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

Fig. 4 is the DFT calculation of the band structure of MoTe2. Fig 4a is the bulk Fermi

surface for kz = 0.6π/c and calculated positions of four Weyl points are marked. The shapes

of outermost electron and hole bands are very similar to our experiment result in Fig. 2b.

Pink dots are projections of the calculated Weyl points on the kz = 0 plane from energy

+28 meV above Fermi level, thus the electron band is not touching the two Weyl point

projections. The surface weighted constant energy contours are shown in 4d - 4g. Fig. 4d

and 4e are at Fermi surfaces of termination A and B, while 4f and 4g are at Fermi level +

28 meV, the DFT predicted energy of W2. In the calculations, W2 is not directly connected

to another W2 by surface states on the Fermi surface of termination A calculation while

they are connected by weak and short surface states in termination B calculation. However,

the W2 points are connected by bulk electron bands in termination A. This is consistent

with our experimental results shown in Fig. 2a-e. Fig. 4b is the bulk band dispersion at

W2-W2 direction, as the vertical dashed line shown in 4a. The two W2 points from DFT

are right at the touching points of one hole band and one electron band. Fig. 4h and 4i

show termination A and B surface band dispersions along the same direction as in Fig. 4b.

The surface bands are to connect bulk states near the positions of the Weyl points. Fig 4j

and 4k are termination A and B surface band dispersions along ky = 0.05 π/a direction, as

the horizontal dashed line shown in 4a. We also calculated the Berry curvature on Fermi

surface. The bright points in Fig. 4c are possible singular points of the Berry curvature

and DFT calculated W2 points are marked in red and blue, indicating diﬀerent chiralities

of the Weyl points. The summary of energy and momentum locations of Weyl points based

on calculations and experiment are provided in Table I.

node. d,e Energy dispersion along kz at ﬁxed kx as shown by cuts in panels (b, c). Cut 1 along
kx = π/2 shows the bulk electron and hole bands touching at the node and the merging of surface
states into the bulk away from the Weyl node. Cut 2 along kx = 0.63π shows a gap between the
bulk bands and a surface state that disperses with opposite velocities at the projections of the two
WPs. The WPs are located at (kx, kz) = (±π/2,±π/2) indicated by pink arrows pointing to green
dots.

METHODS

Sample growth MoTe2 single crystals were grown out of a Te-rich binary melt using a

Canﬁeld crucible set(CCS)16. Mo and Te shots in a ratio of 1:9 were loaded into a 5ml CCS

and sealed in a quartz tube under vacuum. The quartz ampoule was heated up to 1000C

and kept at this temperature for a week. MoTe2 single crystals were isolated from Te ﬂux

by centrifuging. Diﬀerent from most ﬂux growths in which crystals precipitate while cooling

from the homogenizing temperature, our growth was performed at a ﬁxed temperature.

Single crystals grown in this strategy have a RRR 500 and MR 40,000% at 2 K in an

energy resolution was set at 1 meV. The size of the photon beam on the sample was ∼30
µm. Samples were cleaved in situ at a base pressure lower than 1 × 10−10 Torr. Samples
were cooled using a closed cycle He-refrigerator and the sample temperature was measured

using a silicon-diode sensor mounted on the sample holder. The energy corresponding to the

chemical potential was determined from the Fermi edge of a polycrystalline Au reference in

12

electrical contact with the sample.

DFT calculations We ﬁrst performed ﬁrst-principles band structure calculations for

bulk using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization of the generalized gradient ap-

proximation18 and the full-potential (linearized) augmented plane-wave plus local orbitals
(FP-(L)APW+lo) method including the spin-orbit coupling as implemented in the wien2k

code19. We employed the crystal structure determined by our experiment. The muﬃn-tin

radii for Mo and Te atoms, rMo and rTe, were set to 2.50 and 2.33 a.u., respectively. The

maximum modulus for the reciprocal lattice vectors Kmax was chosen so that rTeKmax =

8.00. Next we constructed a tight-binding model consisting of Mo 4d and Te 5p orbitals, the

parameters in which were extracted from the calculated band structure using the Wannier

functions20–22 without the maximal localization procedure. Then we made the slab tight-

binding model of ﬁnite layers, and obtained the band structures and Fermi surfaces. The

Mo and Te states on the top or bottom two layers, i.e. the unit cells of surface A or B, are

emphasized in each ﬁgure. To identify the position of the Weyl points, we also calculated

the Berry curvature for bulk structure using the tight-binding model obtained above. The

dominant contribution for the divergence of the Berry curvature (ΩDD

n,yz, ΩDD

n,zx) presented in

Eq. (30) of Ref.23 was calculated and shown in the ﬁgure.
