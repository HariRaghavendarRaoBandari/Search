Abstract

We probe the dynamics of a modiﬁed form of the Schr¨odinger-Newton system of gravity coupled

to single particle quantum mechanics. At the masses of interest here, the ones associated with the

onset of “collapse” (where the gravitational attraction is competitive with the quantum mechanical

dissipation), we show that the Schr¨odinger ground state energies match the Dirac ones with an error

of ∼ 10%. At the Planck mass scale, we predict the critical mass at which a potential collapse could
occur for the self-coupled gravitational case, m ≈ 3.3 Planck mass, and show that gravitational
attraction opposes Gaussian spreading at around this value, which is a factor of two higher than the

one predicted (and veriﬁed) for the Schr¨odinger-Newton system. Unlike the Schr¨odinger-Newton

dynamics, we do not ﬁnd that the self-coupled case tends to decay towards its ground state; there

is no collapse in this case.

INTRODUCTION

In a recent paper, we studied the spectrum of a modiﬁed form of the usual Schr¨odinger-

Newton system (SN) of gravity coupled to quantum mechanics (SN was originally developed

in [1]). Now we turn to the spherical dynamics of the self-coupled gravity introduced, in

this quantum mechanical setting, in [2].

For the SN system, we have Newtonian gravity determining the potential Φ using the

wave function itself to describe the mass density, so the coupled system is

The spectrum and dynamics of this system of equations has been studied extensively, and

its relevance to single-particle collapse similarly explored – see [3, 4] and references therein

for a review of that discussion.

Motivated by the special relativistic notion that energy and mass are equivalent, we mod-

iﬁed the gravitational piece to include the self-gravity of Φ itself – the resulting static theory

of gravity was originally introduced by Einstein in [5], and has been re-developed periodi-

cally (see [6–9], for example). When we combine this new gravity model with Schr¨odinger’s

equation, we get

(2)

Here, we have modiﬁed the ﬁeld equation for gravity to reﬂect the same sort of self-consistent

self-coupling that is found in full general relativity (albeit in a scalar setting). The form

comes from considering the combined gravity/quantum mechanical equation, from [10, 11],

Gµν = 8 π (cid:104) ˆTµν(cid:105),

(3)

and making a gravitational ﬁeld equation in (2) that is more like the nonlinear (Einstein

tensor) left-hand side of (3) than the linear Poisson equation for gravity found in (1). Both

SN and our modiﬁcation take the source to be m Ψ∗ Ψ, and the approach can be viewed

either as part of a multi-body Hartree approximation, or fundamental (the many-body view

would not change the gravitational ﬁeld equation here – we would still have to incorporate the

energy self-coupling). In this work, we will take a single-particle wave-function which cannot

2

be viewed, by itself, as a Hartree approximation (due to the lack of self-interaction in the

Hartree approach [12]). There are other ways of extending the gravitational ﬁeld equation

to capture additional relativistic eﬀects, like introducing the gravito-magnetic contribution

as in [13]. That allows the “magnetic” component of weak-ﬁeld gravity to play a role in

the SN setting. But that extension retains the linearity of the gravitational ﬁeld equations

themselves. We are working in a complementary direction, in which we extend to include

the self-energy coupling that leads to the nonlinearity of general relativity.

The dynamics of the SN system, in particular, the details of spherical collapse, have been

studied, and our goal is to compare the SN collapse with the (potential) spherical collapse of

an initial Gaussian evolved using (2). En route to that comparison, we will ﬁrst consider the

role of the relativistic Dirac equation with the modiﬁed gravity. Then we will estimate the

critical mass at which the gravitational interaction balances the spreading of a free Gaussian,

for both SN and the modiﬁed gravitational form. In the SN case, this critical mass deﬁnes

the boundary between collapse (to a ground state) and dissipation. For the self-coupled case,

there is no collapse to the ground state, although at the critical mass, there is a balance

between gravity and quantum mechanical dissipation.

II. DIRAC EQUATION

Given that we are using the relativistic notion of energy and mass equivalence to motivate

the use of the modiﬁed form of gravity appearing in (2), it is reasonable to introduce the

competing relativistic eﬀects on the quantum mechanical side. If we start with the Dirac

Lagrangian, coupled to the Lagrangian appropriate to the modiﬁed form of gravity (that

gravitational Lagrangian can be found in [2, 9]),

L = i  ¯Ψ γν ∂µ Ψ − m c2 ¯Ψ Ψ − m Φ ¯Ψ γ0 Ψ −

(4)

then the resulting Dirac equation and modiﬁed gravity coupling gives an eigenvalue problem

for the ground state that looks like (already in spherical coordinates):

where we take κ = 1/2 (no orbital angular momentum).

We can solve this coupled system just as we did in [2] – the numerical method doesn’t

change signiﬁcantly, although there are relativistic details that need to be addressed (the

presence of negative energy states, for example, means we need to be careful how we identify

the ground state). We modiﬁed our method to accommodate the additional complexity, and

proceeded to ﬁnd the ground state energies for the new system (see [14]). The Dirac ground

state energy, as a function of mass, is shown in Figure 1. In that ﬁgure, we also show the

eﬀect of using the Dirac equation together with Newtonian gravity, and the ground state

energy of SN itself, all for comparison.

FIG. 1. The (dimensionless) energy, as a function of mass (in units of Planck mass), for the ground

state of the modiﬁed-gravity-Dirac system is shown with black dots. The same calculation using

a Newtonian gravitational ﬁeld and the Dirac equation is shown in gray dots, and the solid line is

the SN ground state energy, for comparison.

By how much does the ground state energy change when we use the Dirac equation instead

of Schr¨odinger? We can compare the energy estimates directly, as shown in Figure 2. There,

the percentage diﬀerence between the energies computed using the Schr¨odinger equation vs.

the Dirac equation are shown (both cases use the modiﬁed form of gravity, of course). The

divergence of the two energies at the masses shown is relatively mild, with a diﬀerence of

10% at ﬁve Planck masses.

For the temporal evolution of an initial Gaussian, we’ll use the Schr¨odinger equation,

where the numerical method is easy to generate and verify. We will work with large masses,
between 1 and 5 Planck mass, where the ground state energies diﬀer by ∼ 5 − 10% between

diﬀerence in energy is small, and we expect the basic qualitative dynamics to hold using the

Schr¨odinger equation instead of the Dirac equation.

numerical result to be relevant for a wide variety of mass and length scales, the nonlinearity

introduced in the self-coupled form of gravity spoils the scaling, so that the numerical results

refer only to the mass/length scales used. We know that the self-coupled scalar gravity

reduces to Newtonian gravity for small masses, so the results of previous work will hold at

those relevant mass scales (around 1010 u, for example). Our goal is to probe the higher mass

regime, in which the relativistic correction provided by the self-coupling of the gravitational

ﬁeld is signiﬁcant, and these scales are basically forced upon us numerically – the choices

in (8) uniquely render the gravitational ﬁeld equation with unit coeﬃcients.

We’ll start with a spherically symmetric Gaussian wave function:

Ψ(r, 0) =(cid:0)π a2(cid:1)−3/4

e−r2/(2 a2)

(9)

where a2 is the variance (up to constants) of the initial distribution. Then our initial,
dimensionless ¯P is

¯P (R, 0) = r0 R Ψ(r0 R, 0)/P0 = 2(cid:18) 2

π(cid:19)1/4

¯P ∗ ¯P dR =

4 π P 2

0 r0

= √2.

(11)

For our initial Gaussians, we will take a = r0, so that A = 1. While we can make A

larger to spread out the initial distribution of mass as a source for gravity, there is no natural

multiple of r0 to use – one might try to extend the distribution beyond, for example, its
Schwarzschild radius (at 2√2 ¯m in these dimensionless units) – but then the mass required to
achieve collapse also increases, and the initial distribution ends up inside the Schwarzschild

radius again [17].
In order to compare with potential experiments, the relevant scale is
a = .5 × 10−6 m (as in [18]), but in our units, this leads to A ∼ 4 × 1028, inappropriately
large for numerical work. At the low densities implied by taking a = .5 µ m, we know that

the predictions of the self-coupled form of gravity match the Newtonian case. Choosing

A = 1 allows us to probe the regime in which Newtonian gravity must be augmented by the

self-gravity of the ﬁeld (and additional, as yet unknown, physics).

IV. NUMERICAL METHOD

The collapse dynamics of SN have been studied in [16, 18–20], and all use similar methods

to time-evolve initial Gaussians: some variant of Crank-Nicolson and a solver for the grav-

itational Poisson problem in iterative combination. Our method is similar, when applied

to SN, although we use Verlet to ﬁnd the gravitational ﬁeld (as opposed to quadrature or

a pseudo-spectral method). Verlet is easy to apply to the nonlinearity present in the self-

coupled gravitational ﬁeld equation, with its more complicated boundary conditions. The

pieces (Crank-Nicolson and Verlet) can be described separately, but then an iterative step

must be involved to achieve a self-consistent solution. We start by discretizing in space and

time via Rj = j ∆R and Tn = n ∆T for constant spacings ∆R, ∆T . We’ll call the value of
¯P (at location Rj and time Tn) ¯P (Rj, Tn) ≡ ¯P n

j , and similarly ¯φ(Rj, Tn) ≡ ¯φn
j .
The forward-Euler discretization in time, for the Schr¨odinger piece, reads

(12)

This equation holds for all grid points, and we understand that at j = 0, we have ¯P n

0 = 0

for all n, that’s the boundary condition at the origin (for Ψ ﬁnite at the origin, as it should
be, P = r Ψ will be zero at the origin). The spatial grid will extend to R∞ = N ∆R for
integer N , our choice of numerical inﬁnity, and out there we’ll again set ¯P n
N +1 = 0; the wave

function should vanish.

Let the vector ¯Pn contain the (unknown) spatial values at time level n:

and similarly for the vector ¯φn. Then we can write the forward Euler discretization (together

with the boundary conditions) in terms of a matrix-vector multiplication:

where I is the identity matrix, H( ¯φn) is deﬁned by (12), and we highlight its dependence on
the gravitational potential.

¯P n+1 =(cid:0)I − i ∆T H( ¯φn)(cid:1) ¯P n

The backwards Euler version of the problem is

∆T

(15)

(16)

For the gravitational ﬁeld portion, we’ll use Verlet, although the details will change

slightly between the two forms of gravity for reasons that will become clear as we go. For

Newtonian gravity, we start at “spatial inﬁnity” (out at RN ) with the Newtonian limiting
form: ¯φn

N +1 = 1 − √2/RN +1 – the constant term provides a constant

N = 1 − √2/RN and ¯φn

oﬀset (c2 when units are introduced) that doesn’t eﬀect the probability density here, but

we introduce it for comparison with the modiﬁed gravity. Starting at N , we move inwards

according to the Verlet update:

¯φn+1
j−1 =

Rj (cid:12)(cid:12)P n+1

(cid:12)(cid:12)2(cid:19)(cid:19) .

(17)

The procedure for modiﬁed gravity is a little diﬀerent – at spatial inﬁnity, we know that

Newtonian gravity, for a spherically symmetric source of mass m, must limit to − G m
c2 − G m
if a constant oﬀset is desired). But for the modiﬁed gravitational ﬁeld, we have
c2− G ˜m
r as the leading contribution at spatial inﬁnity – the c2 is required so that the modiﬁed
solutions become Newtonian in the non-relativistic limit (see [9]), and the “mass” ˜m depends

(or

r

r

on the details of the central distribution (for example, a point mass m at the origin and a

sphere of homogeneous mass density and total mass m, lead to diﬀerent values for ˜m). Since

the central distribution of mass will change here, the value for ˜m is a function of time, a

complication we’d like to avoid.

Instead, we’ll focus on the value of the ﬁeld as r → 0. For a sphere with homogenous

mass density, the internal ﬁeld Φ(r) looks like (see [8, 9])

Φ =(cid:20)

c

sinh(r/r0)

cosh(R/r0)

r/r0

(cid:21)2

,

(18)

where R is the radius of the sphere and r0 is a constant related to the mass. As r → 0,
φ goes to a constant bounded by c2, and the derivative of φ goes to zero. Since we expect

there to be some non-zero density near the origin, these are reasonable boundary conditions
for our numerical solution, i.e. ¯φn

1 = C, so that the numerical

0 = C a constant ∈ [0, 1] and ¯φn

8

derivative is approximately zero. We will pick C so that ¯φn

N = 1, its limiting value, at spatial

inﬁnity (the best we can do here) by shooting – i.e. we will run forward Verlet:

j+1 =

(19)

In both of these cases, Newtonian and modiﬁed, we must iterate at each time level to
achieve a self-consistent solution – notice that the left-hand side of (16) depends on ¯φn+1,
which we can only get once ¯Pn+1 is known – but we can’t ﬁnd ¯Pn+1 without ¯φn+1. To break
out of the recursion, we will deﬁne an iterative index k – let k ¯Pn+1 and k ¯φn+1 be the k
iteration at time-level n + 1. For k = 0, we deﬁne 0 ¯Pn+1 = ¯Pn and 0 ¯φn+1 = ¯φn. Now, at

level k, we update (using the Newtonian update for simplicity) according to:

where the top line deﬁnes the new value for the wave function, and the second line updates

the gravitational ﬁeld. We proceed with this iteration until

(cid:107) k+1 ¯P n+1 − k ¯P n+1(cid:107) < 

(21)

where  is given – i.e. we continue to iterate until the wave function has stopped changing
signiﬁcantly. Once we have achieved (numerical) convergence, we set ¯P n+1 = k+1 ¯P n+1 and
¯φn+1 = k+1 ¯φn+1, and we’re ready to move on to the next time step.

V. CRITICAL MASS ESTIMATE

The goal of this section is to establish mass values for which the behavior of the initial

Gaussian shifts from “mainly quantum”, with the initial Gaussian spreading out over time,

to “mainly gravitational”, with the initial Gaussian becoming more localized. One simple

way to estimate this mass, from [16], is to take the free particle solution for the initial

Gaussian, which is:

Ψ(r, t) =(cid:0)π a2(cid:1)−3/4 (cid:18)1 +

i  t

m a2(cid:19)−3/2

r2

2 a2 (1+ i  t
m a2 )

−

e

(22)

and note that the peak of r2 Ψ∗(r, t) Ψ(r, t) is located at

rp(t) =(cid:115)a2 +(cid:18)  t
a m(cid:19)2

.

(23)

With no gravitational component, ¨rp(0) = 2

a3 m2 , the initial acceleration of the most-likely
position depends only on m (and the initial variance). With a gravitational force in place,

we have:

¨rp(0) +(cid:18)−

d
dr

Φ(rp(0))(cid:19) = anet(0),

(24)

where anet(0) is the net acceleration (treating the most-likely position as the particle posi-

tion), and we could arrange to have anet(0) = 0 by taking:

¨rp(0) =

d
dr

Φ(rp(0)).

(25)

The Φ(r) that we use depends on both our choice to consider Newtonian or self-coupled

gravity, and the ρ that we decide to use to approximate the initial distribution of “mass”

(in [16], for example, a point particle at the origin is used to perform this estimate [21]).

Since we have a Gaussian proﬁle, we can take ρ = m Ψ∗ Ψ for the initial Ψ given in (9) and

use that to solve for Φ(r). For Newtonian gravity, the ﬁeld associated with this source is

and using this in (25) with r = a (the initial value) gives

m0 ≈ 1.5 m0.

(28)

For the modiﬁed form of gravity, we cannot ﬁnd Φ(r) explicitly, so we turn to a numerical
approach. Given the numerical parameters we will use below, we compute the ¯Φ from the
initial source (the dimensionless ¯m ¯P ∗ ¯P with ¯P and A = 1 from (10), projected onto our

numerical grid) using the Verlet method described in Section IV, then approximate the

derivative using ﬁnite diﬀerence (suitably dimensionless, which throws in a factor of 2) and

evaluate that at ¯r = 1 (a in our dimensionless units), we subtract 4

¯m2 (the dimensionless form

10

of ¨rp(0) here) and then ﬁnd ¯m such that the diﬀerence is close to zero (to within  = 10−5).

behavior.

VI. NUMERICAL DYNAMICS

The numerical results agree well with the predictions from above. In all cases, we take
N = 1000 spatial steps, with R∞ = 50, and set ∆T = 0.1. We can plot the probability
densities as functions of time, for the n = 1, 50 and 100 steps to see what sort of evolution is

happening. Following [16], we also plot the radius in which 90% of the probability lies, this

“R90(T )” value allows us to track the general evolution in time. We will plot that together

with the value associated with a free Gaussian, so we can see what eﬀect gravity (in its

various forms) has. We can further characterize the dynamics by calculating the overlap of

the wave function with the ground state (calculated using the methods of [2]) as a function

of time.

The Crank-Nicolson method we use here is not obviously norm-preserving, unlike the

original one. That lack of manifest norm preservation comes from the time-dependence of
the matrix operator H appearing on the left and right sides of (16). Yet in practice, the
norm is preserved well in all the runs, with the maximum diﬀerence between the numerical

For SN, the probabilities are shown in Figure 4 for ¯m = 1, 1.5, 2 and 3, and a plot of

R90(T ) for each case is shown in Figure 5. There are four diﬀerent behaviors shown in the

plots of R90(T ): 1. for ¯m = 1, the Gaussian spreads out, 2. for ¯m = 1.5, the Gaussian is

oscillating, but with peak position that is further from the origin than at time T = 0, 3.

¯m = 2 has an oscillating solution, where the peak gets closer to the origin and then comes

back out and 4. a collapse (with minimal oscillation) for ¯m = 3 (and greater). From these

plots, the critical mass is somewhere between 1.5 and 2, since at 1.5 we have oscillation

above the initial value of R90(0), and at 2 the oscillation occurs with values less than the

initial R90(0). This estimate of the critical mass basically agrees with our prediction from
the previous section, where we found the critical mass to be ∼ 1.5. In Figure 5, the solid

line shows the value of R90(T ) for a free Gaussian (of appropriate mass) for comparison. As

expected, the gravitational coupling makes the spreading behavior slow down compared to

the free particle case.

In [20], the dynamics of SN is described as a “partial collapse” to the ground state –

we can calculate the overlap of the wave function at time level T with the ground state,
O(T ) = |(cid:104)Ψ(T )|Ψ0(cid:105)|, and the plot of that overlap is shown in Figure 6. Notice that as the
mass increases, the amount of overlap with the ground state increases. For the lower masses,

it is not clear what a longer temporal run would do (oscillate about some ﬁxed, non-unity

value, or increase towards full overlap), but for ¯m = 2 and 3, a clear trend towards collapse

to the ground state is shown.

R90(T ) shown in Figure 8), at masses ¯m = 2, ¯m = 3, ¯m = 4 and ¯m = 10, we again see the

spreading behavior at ¯m = 2, and at ¯m = 3, oscillation has begun. This oscillation does

not represent collapse, though, as can be seen in Figure 8, the oscillation occurs at values

above the initial R90(0) – there is no contraction here. It isn’t until ¯m = 4 that oscillation

with values below the initial R90(0) occurs. So we would put the critical mass somewhere
between ¯m = 3 and 4, again agreeing with our estimate ∼ 3.3. What is surprising in this
case is the lack of decay we saw in, for example, ¯m = 3 of SN (both in the plot of R90(T ) and

in O(T )). Instead, in the self-coupled case, all masses display oscillatory behavior without

“settling down” (we have run up to masses of ¯m = 20, but still see no sign of a collapse to

the ground state).

oscillating towards an overlap of 1 with the ground state, as in SN, the overlap in the self

coupled case does not increase (on average) over time (for the time scales considered here).

As another contrasting feature – in Figure 6, the amount of (time-averaged) overlap increases

with mass, while in Figure 9, the magnitude of the overlap increases, but then decreases as

mass gets larger.

The inclusion of the self-coupling for gravity changes the spherical dynamics at large

masses; while the expected qualitative behavior, free spreading and oscillation, occur in

the expanded gravitational setting, the mass scales at which they occur are roughly twice

those of Newtonian gravity. We estimated the mass scales using a simple equivalence of

quantum mechanical “acceleration” and the gravitational ﬁeld associated with our initial

Gaussian wave function, and that estimate agreed fairly well with the numerical solutions.

The collapse to the ground state, apparent for SN at masses above ¯m = 2 here, is absent

from the self-coupled case (at the time scales considered here – time scales which are relevant

for the SN case, at least).

Because we are using a form of gravity inspired by special relativistic mass-energy equiv-

alence, we ﬁrst calculated the energy spectrum of the quantum-mechanical/self-coupled

gravitational system using the Dirac equation, to compare with the previously published

Schr¨odinger spectrum, and found that, for the masses of interest to us at collapse, the error
in the ground state energy is ∼ 10%, this suggests we can use the Schr¨odinger equation
to evolve the initial Gaussian forward in time without incurring too much error. For com-

parison, the diﬀerence between the ground state energy for SN and Dirac with self-coupled
gravity is ∼ 600%.

Self-coupled gravity does not appear to collapse to its ground state (or any other); the

wave function does not achieve a relatively static steady state, as it does in SN, nor does it

“converge” (in overlap) to its ground state. It would be interesting to establish, analytically,

that the ground state in the self-coupled form of gravity is dynamically unstable, leading

to the observed oscillation without the decay to the ground state present in SN. Another

potential issue is our use of the Schr¨odinger equation – perhaps at higher mass values,

where the Dirac equation is relevant, we would ﬁnd a damped-oscillatory collapse for the

self-coupled gravity.

[17] The Schwarzschild radius is, of course, external to either the Newtonian or self-coupled grav-

work, and we understand that to truly describe the physics at this scale, additional gravita-

tional elements (at the very least) are necessary.
