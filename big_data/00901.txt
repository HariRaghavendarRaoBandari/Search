Topological magnon insulators are a new class of magnetic materials that possess topologically
nontrivial magnon bands. As a result, magnons in these materials display properties analagous
to those of electrons in topological insulators. Here, we present magnetization, speciﬁc heat, and
neutron scattering measurements of the ferromagnetic kagome magnet Cu(1,3-bdc). Our measure-
ments provide a detailed description of the magnetic structure and interactions in this material, and
conﬁrm that it is an ideal prototype for topological magnon physics in a system with a simple spin
Hamiltonian.

INTRODUCTION

In systems where quantum particles are conﬁned to
move in reduced dimensions, lattice geometry and parti-
cle interactions can drive the emergence of a rich variety
of novel behaviors. A canonical example is the quan-
tum Hall eﬀect, which is produced by applying a large
magnetic ﬁeld to a two-dimensional (2D) gas of electrons
or charged quasiparticles1. Some systems exhibit quan-
tum Hall physics without applied magnetic ﬁelds due to
their inherently topological band structures, as demon-
strated by Haldane2. Many materials host topological
band structures as a result of strong spin-orbit coupling,
including the well known topological insulators. Dis-
coveries of these materials have driven much condensed
matter physics research3,4. Recent theoretical work has
been most interested in 2D systems whose band struc-
tures (1) include at least one band that is dispersionless
in energy(ﬂat) and (2) are topologically notrivial. These
studies hope to achieve the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect
without an externally applied magnetic ﬁeld5. Flat bands
are of particular interest because the large number of
states with degenerate kinetic energy allows the particle
interactions to dominate the behavior, which can result in
the emergence of novel strongly correlated phenomena. A
number of recent theoretical works have proposed models
that use ﬂat topological bands to produce the fractional
quantum Hall eﬀect6–8; however, these models require
tuning of multiple parameters, which is not always pos-
sible in real materials.

Topological band structures can be found in a vari-
ety of diﬀerent systems, not only those with electron-
like quasiparticles. In fact, many systems with bosonic
quasiparticles display topological band structures. For
example, topological photon modes can be realized in
photonic crystals9–11. Theoretical proposals for real-

izations of bosonic systems with bands that are both
topologically notrivial and dispersionless include dipo-
lar molecules trapped in an optical lattice12, and pho-
tonic lattices13 based on the interaction between pho-
tons and arrays of superconducting circuits14, although
experimental conﬁrmation has yet to be demonstrated.
Additionally, topological magnon band structures can
be found in insulating ferrogmagnets called topologi-
cal magnon insulators (TMI)15. In these materials, the
magnon band structure includes gapless, nondissipative
edge modes within a bulk band gap, analogous to the
electronic band structure of electronic topological insula-
tors.

We have recently shown the existence of topological
magnon bands in the kagome lattice compound Cu[1,3-
benzenedicarboxylate(bdc)]16, the ﬁrst realization of a
2D TMI. Cu(1,3-bdc) is a metal-organic hybrid material
featuring S = 1/2 Cu2+ ions arranged on a geometri-
cally perfect kagome lattice17. Adjacent kagome planes
are well separated by large organic (1,3-bdc) molecules,
as shown in Fig. 1(a). The long interplane coupling
pathway suggests that the magnetic behavior should be
quasi two-dimensional and the absence of other metal
ions leads to less chance of disorder in the kagome plane.
These three properties – the structurally perfect kagome
lattice, the absence of other species of metal ion, and
the weak interlayer coupling – make Cu(1,3-bdc) an ideal
model material for examining fundamental physics with
a simple spin Hamiltonian.

Magnons in Cu(1,3-bdc) display a number of novel
properties. For example, due to the kagome geometry18,
one of the topologically notrivial magnon bands is also
nearly dispersionless. Additionally, magnons in this ma-
terial display a magnon Hall eﬀect19,20, as conﬁrmed by
thermal Hall measurements21. The magnon Hall eﬀect
may ﬁnd applications in the ﬁeld of spintronics22, as has

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Protonated and deuterated crystals of Cu(1,3-bdc)
were grown under hydrothermal conditions using a sim-
ilar procedure to that reported by Nytko, et al.17. To
increase crystal size, the reaction rate was slowed by us-
ing dilute nitric acid in place of water. Cu(1,3-bdc) is
produced by reaction of Cu(OH)2 with isophthalic acid
(1,3-bdcH2). Since deprotonation of the isophthalic acid
is likely the rate determining step, the reaction rate can
be slowed by lowering the pH and therefore reducing the
concentration of deprotonated 1,3-bdc2− in solution.

Reactions were carried out in 23 mL and 125 mL
PTFE-lined pressure vessels. To synthesize deuterated
crystals, 23 mL (125 mL) liners were charged with 145
mg (435 mg) Cu(OH)2, 250 mg (750 mg) deuterated
isophthalic-d4 acid (1,3-bdcH2), and 8.5 g (25.5 g) 2%
nitric acid in water, and placed into steel hydrothermal
bombs. Bombs were heated to 150◦ and maintained at
this temperature for 21 days, removed from the furnace
at temperature and cooled in air, resulting in clusters
of crystals of Cu(1,3-bdc) forming at the bottoms of the
liners. Crystal clusters were washed in deionized water
and dried in air. Single crystal pieces were were manually
separated from clusters under a microscope, resulting in
crystals with a mass typically 0.1-1 mg but up to 3 mg.
Protonated crystals were synthesized using a similar pro-
cedure except using non-deuterated isophthalic acid. For
protonated crystals, a lower growth temperature of 130◦
was used in order to further increase crystal size.

In order to assemble a sample with enough total
mass for neutron scattering measurements, we partially
coaligned ∼ 2000 individual deuterated crystals. Single
crystal pieces of Cu(1,3-bdc) form as ﬂat ﬂakes with the
(cid:126)c axis perpendicular to the plane of the ﬂat face. There-
fore, the (cid:126)c axes were aligned by arranging crystals on ﬂlat
aluminum plates. The orientation of the kagome plane of
each crystal was not aligned, and is assumed to be ran-
dom. Figure 1(b) shows one such plate. Crystals were
attached to both sides of the plates using Fomblin Y oil
and secured with aluminum foil. Six plates were held
parallel to each other to create a (cid:126)c axis-aligned sample
with total mass 1 g, shown in Fig. 1(c).

Magnetization measurements were performed on both
protonated and deuterated single crystal samples of
Cu(1,3-bdc) using a Quantum Design Magnetic Prop-
erty Measurement System (MPMS). Magnetization was
measured as a function of ﬁeld for ﬁelds up to 7 T at
temperatures T = 1.8 K, 5 K, and 30 K, and as a func-
tion of temperature over the range 1.8 K – 350 K at a
number of applied ﬁelds ranging from 2 mT to 5 T. Mea-
surements were performed with the ﬁeld applied parallel
to and perpendicular to the kagome plane. Low temper-
ature (T < 10 K) measurements were performed under
both ﬁeld-cooled (FC) and zero-ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC) con-
ditions. The speciﬁc heat of a protonated single crystal
sample of Cu(1,3-bdc) was measured using a Quantum
Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS).

been proposed for a number of pyrochlore ferrogmanets
that also display a magnon Hall eﬀect23,24. Finally, as a
realization of the TMI state, magnons in Cu(1,3-bdc) are
expected to display topologically protected chiral edge
modes15, making Cu(1,3-bdc) an experimental system
that could be used to test ideas regarding the use of edge
magnons to manipulate skyrmions25, as well as theoreti-
cal predictions of hybridization of edge modes26.

For the many possible applications of Cu(1,3-bdc),
a thorough understanding of the magnetically ordered
state and of the ordering transition is essential. Our pre-
vious neutron scattering measurements demonstrated the
existence of a long range magnetic ordering transition
where spins within each kagome layer are ordered ferro-
magnetically while spins in neighboring kagome planes
are oriented antiferromagnetically16. Previous magnetic
and speciﬁc heat measurements are consistent with a
ferromagnetic ordering transition near 1.8 K, despite a
negative Curie-Weiss temperature that suggests antifer-
romagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions17. In contrast,
muon spin resonance(µSR) measurements suggested that
below the transition temperature the ﬂuctuation rate of
the spins was slowed, but that there was no long range
ordering of the moments27.
In this report, we present
magnetization, speciﬁc heat, and neutron scattering mea-
surements of Cu(1,3-bdc) and examine the nature of the
magnetically ordered state and the magnetic phase tran-
sition.

(a)5mm(b)(c)Measurements were performed in applied ﬁelds up to 14
T with ﬁeld applied parallel to and perpendicular to the
kagome plane.

Neutron diﬀraction and elastic scattering measure-
ments were performed on the deuterated (cid:126)c axis-aligned
sample described above using the triple-axis spectrom-
eter SPINS at the NIST Center for Neutron Research.
Elastic measurements were done at zero magnetic ﬁeld
with the sample in a He-4 cryostat using neutrons of en-
ergy 3 meV with conﬁguration guide-80’-80’-open. Be
and BeO ﬁlters were placed before and after the sample,
respectively. Diﬀraction measurements were done with
the sample in a dilution insert in a 10 T magnet using
neutrons of initial energy 5 meV. Measurements were per-
fomed in two-axis mode with conﬁguration guide-80’-80’,
with Be ﬁlters placed before and after the sample. The
sample was oriented so that the aligned (cid:126)c axis was in
the scattering plane and the magnetic ﬁeld was applied
parallel to the kagome plane.

Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were per-
formed on a deuterated powder sample of Cu(1,3-bdc)
on the Iris time-of-ﬂight spectrometer at the ISIS facility
at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. An aluminum can
was ﬁlled with 3.9 g of powder and placed in a dilution
refrigerator. A ﬁnal neutron energy of 7.38 meV was se-
lected, giving an energy resolution of ∼70 µeV FWHM.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Crystal Characterization

Figure 2(a) shows the magnetization of Cu(1,3-bdc) as
a function of applied ﬁeld at T = 1.8 K, and the suscep-
tibility χ approximated as M/H measured at a ﬁeld of
µ0H = 0.01 T, for ﬁelds applied both parallel (H⊥c) and
perpendicular (H||c) to the kagome plane. The magneti-
zation is easily saturated by ﬁelds of ∼ 2 T at T = 1.8 K
for both ﬁeld directions. The susceptibility is enhanced,
and saturation is reached at a lower ﬁeld when the ﬁeld is
applied parallel to the kagome plane. The enhancement
in susceptibility persists above the transition to temper-
atures as high as T ≈ 4 K. Very little hysteresis is ob-
served, with a coercive ﬁeld less than 2 mT. No diﬀerence
is observed between ZFC and FC measurements. These
results are consistent with previous measurements per-
formed on powder17 and single crystal28 samples.

At low applied ﬁelds, no diﬀerence in magnetic be-
havior is observed between protonated and deuterated
samples. At high ﬁelds, slight diﬀerences were observed
in the saturation value of the magnetization, which was
1.166(9) µB/Cu with H⊥c and 1.056(5) µB/Cu with H||c
for the protonated sample and 1.109(3) µB/Cu with H⊥c
and 1.075(8) µB/Cu with H||c for the deuterated sam-
ple. This conﬁrms that deuterium substitution has little
eﬀect on the magnetic behavior of Cu(1,3-bdc).

ated crystal measured at µ0H = 0.5 T with ﬁeld applied

parallel to the kagome plane. This plot shows both the
raw data (χ) and the data corrected for the molecular
diamagnetism of the sample (χ-χ0) by use of Pascal’s
constants29. This correction is done to isolate the sus-
ceptibility due to the copper spins. Both sets of data
were ﬁt to a Curie-Weiss function over the temperature
range 150 K ≤ T ≤ 350 K. Surprisingly, the raw inverse
susceptibility data is better ﬁt by a linear model than the
data corrected for the sample’s diamagnetism. The data
also deviate less from the ﬁt line at lower temperatures.
The ﬁt to the raw data gives a Curie-Weiss temperature
of ΘCW = 3 ± 1 K, while the ﬁt to the corrected data
gives ΘCW = −10 ± 1 K. A positive Curie-Weiss tem-
perature suggests a ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor ex-
change coupling, while a negative temperature suggests
antiferromagnetic coupling. This sign descrepancy makes
it diﬃcult to determine the coupling from the inverse sus-
ceptibility data. We therfore abandon Curie-Weiss ﬁts

netic contribution to the zero-ﬁeld speciﬁc heat by sub-
tracting the speciﬁc heat measured at µ0H = 14 T, and
use this to calculate the magnetic entropy, which is shown
in Fig. 3(d). The magnetic entropy released in zero ﬁeld
below the transition temperautre T = 1.77 K down to the
lowest measured temperature of T = 0.4 K was found to
be only 24% of kBln(2) per spin, while about 40% is re-
leased between 5 K and the transition temperature. At
higher temperatures, the approximation of the 14 T data
as nonmagnetic becomes invalid, but the zero-ﬁeld mag-
netic contribution to the speciﬁc heat is nonzero at least
up to T = 6.5 K, where the zero-ﬁeld and 14 T data in-
tersect. Some entropy may also be lost at temperatures
lower than could be measured, but it is clear that a large
fraction of the magnetic entropy is released at tempera-
tures well above the transition temperature.

B. Magnetic Structure

Longitudinal

scans and θ scans were performed
through the (0 0 L) Bragg peaks for L = 1 – 6 at the
base temperature of 70 mK. The (0 0 L) structural peaks
are forbidden for odd values of L because there are two
identical kagome layers per unit cell. Bragg peaks were
observed at all six measured positions. Peaks at (0 0 L)
for odd values of L were quickly suppressed by applica-
tion of a magnetic ﬁeld. These peaks also disappeared
above 1.8 K. Figure 4(a)/(b) shows representative scans
through (0 0 1). Application of a magnetic ﬁeld also en-
hanced the intensity of the peak at (0 0 4), as shown in
Fig. 4(c)/(d).

In contrast with the µSR result27, our observation of
the emergence of magnetic Bragg peaks below 1.77 K is
a clear sign of a transition to a state with long range
magnetic ordering. The magnetic peaks at (0 0 L) for
odd values of L, where structural peaks are forbidden,
demonstrate the existence of antiferromagnetic ordering
between neighboring kagome planes. The suppression of
these peaks with magnetic ﬁeld along with the growth of
the (0 0 4) peak shows the material is easily pushed into
a fully spin polarized state, which is consistent with the
easily saturated magnetization (Fig. 2). This easy satur-
ization, combined with our observation of magnons con-
sistent with ferromagnetic coupling16 demonstrates that
spins within each kagome plane are ordered ferromagnet-
ically.

To investigate the zero-ﬁeld ordered magnetic state,
we examined the integrated intensities of the measured
Bragg peaks. The scattered intensity from a magneti-
cally ordered crystal is proportional to the component of
the spin that is perpendicular to the momentum (cid:126)Q.30 If
the spins point parallel to the (cid:126)c axis, there will be no
magnetic scattering at (0 0 L) positions. Therefore the
ground state spins must have some component parallel
to the kagome plane for the (0 0 L) magnetic peaks to be
observed.

The integrated intensity of a θ-scan through a nu-

as an accurate characterization of the Cu(1,3-bdc) spin
Hamiltonian. Our previously reported inelastic neutron
scattering measurements16 demonstrated that nearest-
neighbor coupling is ferromgnetic with J = 0.6 meV
(J/kB = 7 K).

The temperature dependence of the speciﬁc heat of
Cu(1,3-bdc) is shown in Fig. 3. Figure 3(a) displays the
data measured at a number of ﬁelds with the ﬁeld ap-
plied perpendicular to the kagome plane. In zero applied
ﬁeld, a peak is observed at T = 1.77 K, which is similar
to that observed in previous measurements17 and consis-
tent with the onset of magnetic order at that tempera-
ture. With increasing applied ﬁeld, the peak broadens
and shifts to higher temperatures. Figure 3(b) compares
measurements with a ﬁeld of µ0H = 0.1 T applied in
the two diﬀerent directions. No diﬀerence is observed at
temperatures far away from the peak in the speciﬁc heat.
At temperatures near the peak, the speciﬁc heat is en-
hanced when the ﬁeld is applied parallel to the kagome
plane. This eﬀect is suppressed at high ﬁelds, and is no
longer detectable for ﬁelds greater than 5 T. A 14 T ﬁeld
shifts magnetic scattering to higher temperatures, and
reveals that the speciﬁc heat is dominated by the mag-
netic contribution below ∼ 5 K, as shown in Fig 3(c).

Figure 3(c) shows that there is a signiﬁcant magnetic
contribution to the speciﬁc heat at temperatures well
above the transition temperature. We isolate the mag-

Figure 5(a) shows diﬀerent models that were assumed
for Pmono. The SPINS monochromater consists of nine
pyrolitic graphite blades, each with a mozaic width of 30(cid:48).
We modeled the incoming vertical distribution as nine
sources each with a gaussian distribution about a diﬀer-
ent mean value of kz
i . We tried both equal weighting and
a triangular weighting of these nine gaussians. We also
tried models that ignored the details of the monochro-
mater and just treated it as a source with ﬁnite size.
With these models we also tried both a square and a
triangular distribution. We also considered the case of
perfect vertical collimation, where Pmono is modeled as
a δ-function and all neutrons are assumed to have initial
vertical momentum kz

i = 0.

Figure 5(b) shows a θ-scan at the (0 0 1) Bragg position
at zero applied ﬁeld. The scan taken at µ0H = 0.5 T was
used as background and subtracted from the zero-ﬁeld
scan. This scan provides a measurement of the mozaic
width of the sample in the scattering plane. The mozaic
is approximately Gaussian with width 4.6◦. The (cid:126)c axis-
aligned crystals that make up the measured sample have
no preferred orientation in the plane perpendicular to
(cid:126)c. Therefore, the mozaic perpendicular to the scattering
plane should be similar to the mozaic in the scattering
plane. We model the vertical mozaic as a Gaussian with
width 4.6◦. Psample depends both on the mozaic width
and on the momentum of the Bragg reﬂection. A neu-

A θ scan rotates the sample through the Bragg reﬂec-
tion. Integrating over this scan accounts for the horizon-
tal divergence of the beam and for the mozaic width of
the sample in the scattering plane. The SPINS spectrom-
eter also includes a vertically-focusing monochromater,
so the incident beam includes neutrons with some compo-
nent of their momentum perpendicular to the scattering
plane. This beam divergence combined with the broad
sample mozaic – due to imperfect alignment of the indi-
vidual crystals – results in a decrease in measured inten-
sity at higher values of (cid:126)|Q|, because of the ﬁnite detector
height.

To account for the eﬀect of the vertical beam diver-
gence on measured Bragg intensity, we calculated the
fraction of the scattered beam that would be incident
on the detector as a function of (cid:126)|Q|:

and for the ﬁeld-induced ferromagnetic peak at (0 0 4).
For this we assumed full ferromagnetic ordering again
with the spins conﬁned to the kagome plane. The mag-
netic form factor was assumed to be the free Cu2+ ion
form factor31, and the g-value of gxy = 1.9 from our ﬁts to
the inelastic spectrum16 was used. All calculated inten-
sities were normalized to the (0 0 2) calculated intensity
to account for the unknown constant of proportionality.
θ scans of the (0 0 L) Bragg peaks were background-
subtracted and integrated as a measure of the total
peak intensity. For odd values of L, the scans taken at
µ0H = 0.5 T were used as a measure of the background.
For the structural peaks at even values of L, a linear ﬁt to
the four points furthest from the peak was used to esti-
mate background. To get a measure of the ﬁeld-induced
magnetic intensity at (0 0 4), the zero-ﬁeld scan was sub-
tracted from the 0.5 T scan to remove both background
and the structural peak signal.
Integrated values were
normalized to the measured intensity of the (0 0 2) peak
and then divided by the calculated intensity.

to calculated peak intensity. The value of 1.0 indicates
that the measured and calculated intensities agree. The
structural peaks were included as a check of our vertical
divergence calculation, and the ﬁeld-induced peak at (0
0 4) was included to check that the use of the free Cu2+
ion form factor was a reasonable approximation of the
true form factor. The antiferromagnetic peak intensities
(red circles) provide a measured value for the ordered
moment. Since the calculated value of the intensity as-
sumed spins were aligned parallel to the kagome plane,
the intensities shown in Fig. 6 can be interpreted as the
ratio of the square of the measured moment to the square
of the full moment:

From our measurements we can determine a value of

tron scattering from a crystal inclined by an angle φ from
the scattering plane will have its vertical component of
momentum changed by ∆kz = −Qz = − (cid:126)|Q| sin(φ). Us-
ing this relation we convert the mozaic distribution to a
(cid:126)|Q|-dependent distribution of ∆kz.

Pdet was assumed to be a square distribution to reﬂect
the ﬁnite size of the detector.
It depends only on the
size of the detector, the sample to detector distance, and
the energy of the diﬀracted neutrons. Fig. 5(c) shows
the calculated intensity as a function of (cid:126)|Q| for our dif-
ferent models. There was very little diﬀerence between
the square distribution of monochromater blades and the
overall square distribution, and very little diﬀerence be-
tween the two triangular distributions as well. At low
values of (cid:126)|Q|, the calculated intensity is slightly depen-
dent on the chosen model of Pmono. At higher (cid:126)|Q|, the
calculation becomes independent of the model of Pmono,
but more dependent on the gaussian width used in the
model of Psample. To account for these diﬀerences, we
included an error bar of 10% of the calculated value in
calculations using this predicted scaling.

We calculated the expected intensity for each of the

measured Bragg peaks:

that will be measured due to the vertical divergence of
the beam. For odd values of L, F(00L) was calculated as-
suming spins were ferromagnetically ordered within each
kagome plane and antiferromagnetically ordered between
planes, and that they were conﬁned to the kagome plane.
We also calculated the intensity for the structural peaks

which suggests that the spins point entirely within the
kagome plane. The stated uncertainty represents one
standard deviation.

Figure 7 shows a schematic of the ground state
spin conﬁguration, which summarizes the results of our
diﬀraction measurements. At zero ﬁeld, spins within each
kagome plane are ferromagnetically orderered and point
parallel to the kagome plane, while neighboring kagome
planes are antiferromagnetically ordered. Due to the ex-
istence of two copper layers per unit cell, the magnetic
unit cell is equivalent to the structural unit cell. A small
magnetic ﬁeld (µ0H (cid:38) 0.05 T at 70 mK) reorients the
spins so that neighboring planes are ferromagnetically
ordered.

C.

Interplane Coupling

To determine the interplane magnetic coupling, we ex-
amine the ﬁeld dependence of the magnetic Bragg peak
intensities, shown in Fig. 8. The (0 0 1) peak is fully
suppressed by µ0H ∼ 0.03 T. The falloﬀ in intensity is
symmetric about H = 0 and shows no sign of hysteresis.
The peak at (0 0 4) reaches its peak intensity at the same
ﬁeld and is not enhanced further up to µ0H = 10 T.

As evidenced by the small ﬁelds required to fully po-
larize the magnetic moments in Cu(1,3-bdc), the anti-
ferromagnetic interplane coupling JAF is much smaller
than the ferromagnetic in-plane nearest neighbor cou-
pling J. Therefore, we assume the application of a mag-
netic ﬁeld only changes the relative orientation of neigh-
boring planes and does not disturb the ferromagnetic or-
dering of each plane. In other words, we treat this system
as a 1D chain of antiferromagnetically coupled classical
spins in a magnetic ﬁeld. The energy of the system is

This conﬁguration is shown schematically in the inset of
Fig. 8. The antiferromagnetic peak at (0 0 1) is due
to the antiparallel component of the spins, and therefore
its intensity is proportional to sin2 φ, while the (0 0 4)
peak intensity is proportional to cos2 φ. Lines in Fig. 8
show ﬁts to the data using these functions, which return
a value of JAF = 1.65(4)µeV . Thus |JAF /J| ≈ 0.003 and
the treatment of the magnetic behavior of Cu(1,3-bdc) as
2D is justiﬁed.

D. Magnetic Ordering Transition

In this section we address the nature of the magnetic
ordering transition by comparing the temperature depen-
dences observed in elastic and inelastic neutron scattering
measurements.

To examine the critical behavior of the magnetic tran-
sition, a temperature scan of the 0-ﬁeld (0 0 1) peak in-
tensity was performed. Temperature control of the mag-
net cryostat became unstable above 1.3 K. In order to
investigate the behavior near the transition temperature
of ∼1.8 K, we combined three diﬀerent measurements of
the (0 0 1) peak intensity. First, below 1.3 K measure-
ments of the peak intensity were taken with the temper-
ature stable at a set point. Second, measurements were
perfomed continuously in 30 s increments while cooling
the sample from above 2 K to base temperature. For
these points a temperature error bar is included which is
the diﬀerence in temperature between the start and end
of the 30 s measurement interval. Third, a temperature
scan of the (0 0 1) peak intensity was performed with
the sample in the He-4 cryostat, allowing for measure-
ment around 1.8 K at stable temperatures. To compare
the intensitites of the diﬀraction measurements taken in
the 10 T magnet and the elastic scattering measurements
taken in the He-4 cryostat, background signal was es-
timated by ﬁtting a constant to data points measured
at temperatures above 3 K. After subtracting the back-
ground from each data set, the overlapping data point
at T = 1.63 K was scaled to be the same in both data

sets. By combining these three measurements as shown
in Fig. 9(a), we were able to examine the behavior of the
(0 0 1) peak through the transition temperature. This
combined temperature scan was ﬁt to the function (1-

and Tc = 1.77(2) K. This value of Tc is consistent with the
transitions observed in our speciﬁc heat measurements
and in µSR27 measurements.

We also examined the temperature dependence of the
magnetic ﬁeld-induced peak at (0 0 4). A ﬁeld of mag-
nitude µ0H = 0.05 T was applied and the (0 0 4) peak
intensity was measured while cooling from 2.4 K to 70
mK. The ﬁeld strength of 0.05 T was chosen because it
was strong enough to produce the maximum intensity of
the (0 0 4) peak at T = 70 mK. To isolate the magnetic
component of the scattering, the (0 0 4) peak intensity
measured at T = 70 mK and zero applied ﬁeld was sub-
tracted to remove the contributions from the structural
peak and from background. The ﬁeld broadens the tran-
sition and shifts it to higher temperatures.

In the magnetically ordered state, the magnetic exci-
tation spectrum includes a ﬂat mode at energy transfer
1.8 meV16. We investigated the temperature dependence

of a powder sample of Cu(1,3-bdc). Figure 10(a) shows
the inelastic neutron scattering data integrated over a
−1
range of momentum transfers 1.0 ˚A
at 100 mK and 40 K. Intensities at diﬀerent tempera-
tures were normalized by integrating over the measured
energy range −3.7 meV ≤ ω ≤ 6.1 meV. We assume the
total scattering intensity to be constant over this interval.
The peak at 1.8 meV appears at low temperatures and
is due to the non-dispersive magnetic excitation. The
smaller peak seen in the 40 K data around 1.9 meV is a
temperature-independent background signal most likely
due to scattering from the cryostat.

The inelastic scattering signal is proportional to the
dynamic structure factor S( (cid:126)Q, ω) = [n(ω)+1]χ(cid:48)(cid:48)( (cid:126)Q, ω),
where n(ω) is the Bose occupation factor and χ(cid:48)(cid:48)( (cid:126)Q, ω)

To
isolate the inelastic signal due to scattering from the sam-
ple we applied the following procedure, following Helton
et al.32. For negative energy transfers at low tempera-
tures, the scattered intensity is only background because
the scattering from the sample is suppressed by the Bose
factor. Therefore, χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω, T = 40 K) can be calculated
by subtracting the intensity measured at 100 mK from
that measured at 40 K and dividing by the Bose fac-
tor. Then χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω, T = 40 K) is known for positive energy
transfers because χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω) is an odd function of ω. The
positive energy transfer background can be calculated
by subtracting the calculated signal at 40 K from the
measured intensity at 40 K. Assuming this background
is temperature-independent in the range 100 mK to 40
K, this background can be subtracted from the intensi-
ties measured at other temperatures to arrive at S(ω,T ).
χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω,T ) is then calculated by dividing by the Bose factor.
Figure 10(b) shows χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω, T = 40 K). Points at small
energy transfer, |ω| < 0.5 meV were removed because
at these energy transfers the intensity at 100 mK is not
only background, but also includes a contribution from
the elastic line due to the instrumental resolution. The
peak in the scattered intensity at ω ∼ −1.4 meV (see
Fig. 10(a)) is a known background signal most likely due
to scattering from aluminum windows, and its eﬀects are
not fully canceled out by subtracting the two data sets.
Points in the range 1.25 meV ≤ |ω| ≤ 1.55 meV were
removed and replaced by ﬁtting a smooth function to the
remaining data points. χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω, T = 40 K) was then used
to calculate χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω) for the other measured temperatures.
χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω, T = 100 mK) is also shown in Figure 10(b).

χ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ω) was integrated over the range 1.5 meV ≤ |ω| ≤
2.1 meV for each temperature to get a measure of the ﬂat
mode intensity. The results are shown in Fig. 10(c). Sig-
niﬁcant spectral weight remains in this energy transfer
range well above the 3D transition temperature of 1.77
K seen in the temperature scan of the magnetic Bragg
peaks (Fig. 9(a)). This suggests the existence of 2D
correlations within the kagome planes at temperatures
above the ordering transition temperature. This is sup-
ported by our observation that a signiﬁcant fraction of
the magnetic entropy is lost in the temperature range 2
K < T < 5 K, as discussed in section III(A).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We performed detailed thermodynamic and neutron
scattering measurements of the 2D TMI material Cu(1,3-
bdc). We examine the magnetic structure in the low-
temperature ordered state and show that under zero
applied ﬁeld spins point parallel to the kagome plane.
Magnetization measurements reveal that a small mag-
netic ﬁeld can fully polarize the spins in any direction,
although they are most easily polarized parallel to the
kagome plane. We use ﬁeld-dependent neutron scattering
measurements to deduce the antiferromagnetic interplane
coupling, and show that it is ∼0.3% of the ferromagnetic
in-plane nearest neighbor coupling. This conﬁrms that
the treatment of the magnetic behavior of Cu(1,3-bdc) as
2D is justiﬁed. Speciﬁc heat and neutron scattering mea-
surements show a clear 3D magnetic ordering transition
at Tc = 1.77 K but also reveal signiﬁcant magnetic cor-
relations at much higher temperatures, consistent with
2D behavior. At least 40% of the spin entropy is lost at
temperatures above Tc, where signiﬁcant spectral weight
also remains in the topologically nontrivial ﬂat magnon
band. Our results conﬁrm that Cu(1,3-bdc) is an ideal
test material for examining 2D spin physics with a simple
Hamiltonian, and provide a more complete understand-
ing of the magnetic ordering in Cu(1,3-bdc) that gives
rise to the TMI state.
