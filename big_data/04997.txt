We present a novel method for sorting events. So far, single variables
like ﬂow vector magnitude were used for sorting events. Our approach
takes into account the whole azimuthal angle distribution rather than a
single variable. This method allows us to determine the good measure of
the event shape, providing a multiplicity-independent insight. We discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, the possible usage in
femtoscopy, and other more exclusive experimental studies.

1. Introduction

Initial conditions in heavy ion collisions ﬂuctuate from event to event:
there are diﬀerent impact parameters and diﬀerent initial energy-density dis-
tributions. Hot matter created in those collisions expands very fast in both
longitudinal and transverse directions, initial inhomogeneities are translated
into all orders of anisotropy of this expansion. The analysis of event shapes
can help us identify events with similar initial conditions undergoing simi-
lar evolution. We present a novel study of event shapes using the algorithm
proposed in [1]. This algorithm studies the shape of the distribution rather
than a single variable. It compares, sorts and selects events according to
similarity with each other.

2. The method

The method is thoroughly described in [2]. Here it will be brieﬂy de-
scribed using a simple example. We generated 5000 events from a toy model.

The parameters vn are quadraticaly multiplicity dependent, details can be
found in [2], multiplicity M ∈ (300, 3000). This choice is motivated by the
LHC data [3, 4].

For each event, we made an azimuthal angle histogram with 20 bins.
Every event is then described by its record {ni}. Since we are studying angle
distribution, the choice of rotating single events is free. We will address this
issue in the next section. The algorithm operates as follows [2]:

1. (Somehow rotate the events)
2. Order events according to a chosen variable
3. Divide the sorted events into quantiles (deciles)
4. For every event calculate the probability that event with record {ni}

belongs to event bin µ: P (µ|{ni})

5. For every event calculate mean bin number ¯µ (values 1 - 10):

¯µ =P µP (µ|{ni})

6. Sort events according to ¯µ
7. If the new sorting changed the assignment of any events into event

bins, return to (3). Otherwise the algorithm converged.

Events with a similar shape are organized by the algorithm so that they end
up close together. There is no speciﬁc observable according to which the
sorting proceeds. Moreover, the ﬁnal arrangement of events is independent
of the initial sorting.

3. Results

usually q2 = |Pn

First, we tested the algorithm using events which include only v1 and
v2. One of the methods used in event shape studies is Event shape engi-
neering [5]. This method sorts the events according to a chosen observable,
j=1 e2iφj |/M . We were interested in verifying whether q2
is truly a good measure for sorting events. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the
correlation of ¯µ with v2 is clearly better than correlation of ¯µ with q2. This
means v2 is better observable for sorting events than q2 in this simple case.
As mentioned before, the rotation of each event can be arbitrary. Since in
this simple case v2 is clearly dominant, we decided to rotate events in a way
that ψ2 = 0.

In order to test more realistic setting, we then generated events with
all ﬁve orders of Eq. (1). The initial event rotation is not as simple as in

the previous case. Interplay of harmonics comes into play. We rotated the
events according to the bisector of ψ3 and ψ2. Moreover, we have to take
care of the parity symmetry. Hence, the events are oriented so that ψ2 is
less than π/2 away from ψ3 counterclockwise. The ﬁnal event sorting is
shown in Fig. 2. It turns out that v2 is as bad for sorting events as q2 and
the sorting is not even dominated by v3. Higher harmonics do not play any
role at all. This suggests that event shape is determined by an interplay of
several observables.

4. Conclusions and outlook

The proposed sorting algorithm provides a novel method to identify
events which have evolved similarly. Our results conﬁrm the importance of
elliptic and triangular ﬂows for the event shape analysis.

Our approach can be useful in studies including mixed events technique.
One could do, e.g., a femtoscopic study of an exclusive group of events.
This means that we could get as close as possible to singe-event femtoscopic
studies. Event Shape Sorting could provide a selection of events with simi-
lar momentum distributions which would make a suitable sample for event
mixing. In case of statistics in a single event being too small, one could take
a sample of events with similar momentum distributions and reasonably ex-
pect that they also have the same sizes and undergo the same dynamics.
Then, one could analyse the correlation function integrated over the whole
selected event sample. The feasibility of such studies will be investigated in
the future.

On the technical side, the required computational time is rather high,
but since we have not optimised our algorithm yet, we expect the required

tion of events.

Furthermore, we are currently studying a set of events obtained by
AMPT. This will bring an insight into more realistic events.
In spite of
these diﬃculties, we believe that our method is worth applying in real data
and that it will bring more detailed understanding of heavy-ion collisions
dynamics.
