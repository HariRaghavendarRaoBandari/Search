Singlet ﬁssion (SF) is a multi-exciton generation process that could be harnessed to improve the
eﬃciency of photovoltaic devices. Experimentally, systems derived from the pentacene molecule
have been shown to exhibit ultrafast SF with high yields. Charge-transfer (CT) conﬁgurations are
likely to play an important role as intermediates in the SF process in these systems. In molecular
crystals, electrostatic screening eﬀects and band formation can be signiﬁcant in lowering the energy
of CT states, enhancing their potential to eﬀectively participate in SF. In order to simulate these,
it desirable to adopt a computational approach which is acceptably accurate, relatively inexpensive,
which and scales well to larger systems, thus enabling the study of screening eﬀects. We propose
a novel, electrostatically-corrected constrained Density Functional Theory (cDFT) approach as a
low-cost solution to the calculation of CT energies in molecular crystals such as pentacene. Here
we consider an implementation in the context of the ONETEP linear-scaling DFT code, but our
electrostatic correction method is in principle applicable in combination with any constrained DFT
implementation, also outside the linear-scaling framework. Our newly developed method allows us
to estimate CT energies in the inﬁnite crystal limit, and with these to validate the accuracy of the
cluster approximation.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Singlet ﬁssion (SF) is a multiple-exciton-generation
process that is of great interest for potential applica-
tions in photovoltaics [1–3]. Crystalline pentacene is a
material that exhibits highly eﬃcient SF on an ultrafast
timescale of around 80 fs [4]. The system has been in-
vestigated in a number of experimental [5–8], theoretical
[9–13], and combined [14, 15] studies. Pentacene is a ﬁve-
membered linear polyacene and forms molecular crystals
with a characteristic ‘herringbone’ lattice (Fig. 1). Inter-
molecular charge-transfer (CT) states spanning nearest-
neighbour molecules are thought to play a central role
in the ultrafast SF process in pentacene and similar
molecules [10, 16–18].
In molecular crystals, neigh-
bouring pairs of molecules (dimers) undergoing charge-
transfer are embedded in a complex molecular environ-
ment where screening and hybridisation eﬀects are im-
portant.

Angular-momentum preserving CT states are diﬃcult
to access with experimental techniques as they are op-
tically dark, making it challenging to measure accurate
excitation energies [19, 20]. They also pose a challenge to
electronic structure theory. For example, linear-response
time-dependent DFT with local exchange is known to
perform poorly on CT-like states, severely underestimat-

ing their energies [21]. This stems from the fact that
local functionals are unable to describe the long-ranged
electron-hole interaction correctly, a problem that is re-
lated to, and which compounds, the well-known band-
gap error of the underlying ground-state DFT calcula-
tion. A possible remedy is the use of long-range cor-
rected functionals with asymptotically correct exchange
[22]. However, this comes at the expense of introducing
additional parameters and of a greatly increased com-
putational cost. It is thus desirable and timely to con-
struct a low-cost method that scales well to large system
sizes and complex environments, and which simultane-
ously describes the electrostatic and quantum mechanical
features of CT states with reasonable accuracy.

In this work, we make use of constrained DFT (cDFT)
[24–27] in combination with linear-scaling DFT (as im-
plemented in the ONETEP code [28]), applying it to
intermolecular charge-transfer in two nearest-neighbour
dimers taken from the pentacene crystal structure. The
cDFT method has been applied to a wide variety of
molecular systems, to date, in the context of CT exci-
tation energies [29–32], electronic couplings [33–35], elec-
tron transfer [36–39] and molecular dynamics [40, 41]. A
largely unresolved issue in this context, however, is that
of achieving supercell convergence of CT excitations in
extended models suitable for capturing the screening and

where K αβ is called the density kernel. The NGWFs
are strictly truncated at a chosen localisation radius,
which is a convergence parameter. The computational ef-
fort of traditional DFT methods, based on manipulation
of Kohn-Sham eigenstates, inevitably scales as O(N 3),
where N denotes the number of electrons. This is because
there are O(N ) eigenstates represented via O(N ) basis
functions, which have to be kept mutually orthogonal to
O(N ) other eigenstates. By contrast, in a density ma-
trix representation, it is possible to achieve overall O(N )
scaling if the density kernel is truncated at some cutoﬀ
radius such that it is a sparse matrix. This exploits the
‘near-sightedness’ of electronic structure in systems with
a gap [49]. Instead of imposing orthogonality explicitly
on Kohn-Sham states, it is necessary to constrain the
density matrix to be idempotent and have a trace equal
to the number of electrons N. In ONETEP, a nested loop
optimisation scheme, utilising a conjugate gradients algo-
rithm, is used to minimise the total energy with respect
to both K αβ (subject to the constraints of idempotency
and normalisation), and the set of NGWFs {φα(r)}. This
approach has been shown to provide total energies and
forces in O(N ) eﬀort with systematically controllable ac-
curacy equivalent to that of a plane-wave basis [50]. This
is possible despite using a minimal number of NGWFs
(i.e., typically one per hydrogen atom, four per carbon
atom), since the NGWFs are optimised in an underlying
variational basis set of ‘psinc’ functions (delta functions
with limited spectral range), which are fully equivalent
to plane-waves.

B. Constrained DFT

In constrained DFT (cDFT) [24–26] the DFT total en-
ergy functional is augmented with terms that impose de-
sired constraints on the charge (and/or spin) density of a
system. While these constraints can take several forms,
in this work we impose them using monomer-localised
projection operators to partition the density. This gives
a total functional of the form:

hybridisation eﬀects encountered in realistic systems. A
solution to this problem, such as that which we presently
propose, is then readily transferable to a range of complex
systems of technological interest, not only in the context
of photovoltaics, but also organic electronics [42–44] and
spintronics [45].

We ﬁrst calculate CT energies for the dimers in iso-
lation, and we subsequently include screening eﬀects by
embedding such dimers in a small cluster of neighbours,
and in supercells of the crystal. Supercell calculations
allow us to approach the inﬁnite limit using a correction
scheme that eliminates the spurious dipole-dipole interac-
tions between periodic images of the simulation cell. The
only inputs required for this correction are the intrinsic
dipole of the CT conﬁguration and the dielectric tensor
of the crystal. The latter is obtained from a density func-
tional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculation [46]. We
ﬁnd that a single parameter, ﬁt to the results of a series
of calculations on diﬀerent supercells, is suﬃcient to cor-
rect for the overestimation of electrostatic screening as a
result of the aforementioned band-gap problem of DFT.
The isolated calculations facilitate a comparison of the
cDFT method with higher-level theory results from the
literature [47]. In addition comparison between clusters
and the inﬁnite limit enables us to directly conﬁrm the
validity of the cluster approximation.

A. The ground state: linear-scaling DFT

In order to carry out ground and excited state calcu-
lations on large clusters and supercells, we use linear-
scaling DFT as implemented in the ONETEP code [28].
This LS-DFT methodology is based on the single-electron
density matrix ρ(r, r(cid:48)) rather than Kohn-Sham orbitals
ψi(r). The density matrix is expanded in a basis of

sites I

Here, the VI are Lagrange multipliers that enforce occu-
pancy targets NI on speciﬁc sites in the system, which
are deﬁned via projectors ˆPI. The sites in question may,
generally, be atoms, groups of atoms or entire molecules.
For example, if one aims to describe an intermolecular
CT state, each of the two molecules involved constitutes
a site. The Lagrange multipliers VI act as artiﬁcial con-
straining potentials that cause charge to move around the

system (cf. Fig. 2a). These potentials are optimised in-
situ, via a further conjugate gradients algorithm nested
between kernel optimisation and NGWF optimisation,
and iterated until the population targets NI for the cho-
sen sites are met. In the case of intermolecular CT states,
these targets are, respectively, one fewer charge on the
donor molecule and one additional charge on the accep-
tor, relative to the ground state.

Within the LS-DFT framework it is a natural choice
to employ the aforementioned localised NGWFs to deﬁne
site projectors [51]. In this work we employ a ﬁxed set of
NGWFs from a ground-state calculation for this purpose:

ˆPI =

|φα(cid:105)(cid:104)φα| ,

(3)

(cid:88)

α∈I

where the sum α ∈ I refers to NGWFs centered on atoms
belonging to site I. Here, subscript indices are used to
describe the standard covariant functions |φα(cid:105), while su-
perscript indices refer to their contravariant duals |φα(cid:105),
which obey (cid:104)φα|φβ(cid:105) = δαβ. See Ref. [52, 53] for further
discussion on this topic. A complication in the deﬁnition
of site projection operators arises from the fact that the
NGWFs are not orthonormal (this is true even of atomic
orbitals, in the case of sites comprising more than one
atom), meaning that the duals φα are not the same as
the NGWFs. Instead, they are deﬁned via the inverse of
the NGWF overlap matrix Sαβ = (cid:104)φα|φβ(cid:105):

Given that the overlap and inverse overlap matrices can
both be made sparse by appropriately-chosen truncation,
it is possible to construct the inverse in linear-scaling
computational eﬀort using a sparse matrix implemen-
tation of Hotelling’s algorithm [54]. Duals constructed
using the NGWF overlap matrix for the complete sys-
tem are delocalised over that system, and thus present a
highly undesirable choice for use in cDFT since this im-
plies that constraining potentials VI act non-locally on
the charge density, with donor and acceptor subspaces
overlapping. Appropriate localisation of the duals, to
the region of the system of interest for deﬁning a site, is
achieved by by suitably truncating the NGWF overlap
matrix before its inversion, and then deﬁning subspace
duals for the purposes of building the site projection op-
erators via the resulting subspace inverse overlap matrix
Oαβ instead of the full Sαβ, as described in [55]. Specif-
ically, a ‘site-block’ scheme is imposed on the sparsity of
the NGWF overlap matrix before it is inverted. Here, a
block is deﬁned by all NGWFs associated with a given
site. Overlap matrix elements between NGWFs associ-
ated with diﬀerent sites are set to zero (cf. Fig. 2b). Once
this matrix has been inverted, it retains the same block
pattern of sparsity, meaning that subspace duals are de-
ﬁned as a linear combination of only those NGWFs on
the same constraint site.

When the sites are deﬁned in self-contained manner,
thereby, bi-orthogonality is unavoidably lost between

A nonlocal constraining potential (illustrated by 2D poten-
tial energy surface) constructed from atom-centred functions
is applied to the single-electron density matrix. This causes
charge to redistribute to obey chosen population constraints,
and allows the description of CT excitations within the frame-
work of standard DFT. b) Block scheme of truncated NGWF

NGWFs and duals localised to diﬀerent sites, in the event
that these sites overlap to some degree. This carries the
disadvantage the sum of charges over a set of such sites,
covering the system, may not equal the true total charge.
For well-separated donor and acceptor regions such as in
the system at hand, any overestimation of site charge due
to the latter eﬀect is insubstantial in comparison to the
dramatic overestimation incurred by using delocalised
duals. On the other hand, even when the donor and ac-
ceptor regions do overlap substantially, unlike methods
employing fully delocalized duals our approach ensures
that the constraining potentials remain fully localised to
their respective regions, with a smooth, non-oscillatory
transition at the boundary.

A diﬀerent approach to cDFT in the context of linear-

scaling has been described in Refs. [56, 57].

In order to obtain energies of CT excitations, we ﬁrst
perform a ground state DFT calculation. This yields
both a total energy for the ground state and a set of
converged ground-state NGWFs which are subsequently
used as cDFT projectors. To deﬁne the population tar-
gets for the cDFT run we simply add ±1 to the ground
state populations of the appropriate sites (acceptor: +1;
donor: −1). The diﬀerence between the constrained total
energy and the ground state energy yields the (vertical)
CT excitation energy. Since we are interested in ultrafast
processes like singlet ﬁssion where nuclear relaxation in
the excited state is less signiﬁcant, we restrict our atten-
tion to vertical excitation energies. In general, a geom-
etry optimisation in the excited state would be required
in order to correctly describe longer-lived CT states.

C. Computational Details

For all calculations we employ the LDA functional and
norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The energy cutoﬀ is
chosen as 750 eV. We use 1 NGWF per hydrogen atom
and 4 NGWFs per carbon atom. For the localisation ra-
dius of the NGWFs a value of 10 Bohr is chosen. Us-
ing these parameters the total energy is converged to
1 meV/atom at 10 Bohr NGWF radius compared to
14 Bohr, and to around 25 meV/atom at 750 eV cut-
oﬀ compared to 1250 eV. All NGWFs are initialised to
pseudoatomic orbitals [58] and then optimised in-situ in
terms of the underlying psinc basis. The density kernel
K αβ is not truncated in this work as all systems are small
enough that sparse matrix algebra is only a minor com-
ponent of the total computational eﬀort. For the later
Density Functional Perturbation Theory calculations, we
utilise the CASTEP plane-wave DFT code [59] with the
same pseudopotentials and cutoﬀ energy. The DFPT cal-
culations are performed with 12 k-points, corresponding
to a maximum k-point spacing of 0.05 1/Å.

The S-phase molecular crystal structure considered
here has two molecules per primitive cell and triclinic
(P − 1) space group symmetry. The lattice parameters
are given by a = 7.90 Å, b = 6.06 Å, c = 16.01 Å,
and α = 101.9◦, β = 112.6◦, γ = 85.8◦ [60]. Optimised
molecular geometries are taken from Ref. [23] in order
to facilitate comparison of our calculations with Ref. [47]
where high-level CASPT2/CASSCF and GW/BSE cal-
culations were performed using the same geometries.

For calculations on isolated dimers and clusters we
employ open boundary conditions. This is achieved by
putting the dimers in a large simulation box and truncat-
ing the Coulomb interaction at large distances to elim-
inate electrostatic interactions between periodic images
[61]. The calculations on supercells of the pentacene crys-
tal use periodic boundary conditions.

III. DIMER & CLUSTER CALCULATIONS

The molecular geometries of the ‘herringbone’ dimer
and the ‘parallel’ dimer are shown in Fig. 3. The her-
ringbone dimer represents the unit cell of the pentacene
crystal. While the long axes of the molecules are mostly
aligned, there is a rotational oﬀset around the same long
axis between the units.
In particular, this means that
the two units in the herringbone dimer are not related
by symmetry.

In the parallel dimer, on the other hand, the pentacene
molecules belong to the same sublattice of the crystal
and are related by a translation along lattice vector b
(cf. Fig. 1). As a result the molecular planes of the
molecules are parallel. The translational correspondence
together with the inversion symmetry of single pentacene
molecules mean that the parallel dimer has an inversion
centre, i.e. the units are symmetry-equivalent.

results with higher-level theory. The authors of Ref. [47] iden-
tify the excitation marked by an asterisk as a third locally
excited state dominated by transitions between the frontier
orbitals of the monomers. However, in a dimer there can only
be two states of this kind. Hence, we concluded that the
excitation does in fact have CT character.

Figure 3. Dimer geometries and CT excitation energies from
cDFT (quoted in eV). The signiﬁcant energy gap between the
two CT states in the herringbone dimer can be rationalised
by considering the diﬀerent charge distributions of electron
and hole, and the geometry. The hole orbital corresponds
to the pentacene HOMO which has a node on the long axis
of the molecule. The electron orbital (LUMO), on the other
hand, does not feature such a node. The partial alignment of
the upper molecule with the dipole vector means that the bi-
modal charge distribution on the upper molecule has a lower
Coulomb energy in conﬁguration 1 as compared to conﬁgura-
tion 2. In the parallel case the two CT states are related by
inversion symmetry and the energies are degenerate.

First, we obtain CT energies for the dimers in isola-
tion. The results are summarised in Fig. 3. The most
striking aspect is the signiﬁcant energy gap between the
two CT conﬁgurations in the herringbone dimer due to
their symmetry-inequivalence, as elaborated in the ﬁg-
ure. In the parallel conﬁguration the energies are degen-
erate due to inversion symmetry. The excitation energies
for the herringbone conﬁguration are within ∼0.2 eV of
literature values obtained with higher-level methods (cf.
Table I). For the parallel conﬁguration the discrepancy
may be as large as ∼0.4 eV, depending on the method
compared to.

round the dimers with a small cluster of neighbouring
molecules ﬁxed in the geometry of the molecular crystal
(Table II). The 4-molecule clusters (144 atoms) only in-
clude the CT pair and the two shared nearest-neighbour
molecules in the a-b-plane. In the 10-molecule clusters
(360 atoms), all nearest-neighbour molecules in the a-b-
plane are included. The results are summarised in Ta-
ble II. We observe a signiﬁcant down shift of the mean
energy and closing of the relative gaps as the size of the
cluster increases. This is driven by a reduction of the
gap due to the hybridisation and increased electrostatic
screening by neighbouring molecules. It should be noted
that the degeneracy of the two parallel dimer CT states is
very slightly lifted in the clusters (which does not exhibit
exact inversion symmetry), but only within the quoted
accuracy. Therefore, we only give a single value for the
CT energy.

From the presented set of calculations alone it is dif-
ﬁcult to determine whether suﬃcient convergence to the
inﬁnite limit has been reached with the 10-molecule clus-
ter.

IV. SUPERCELL CALCULATIONS

We now consider the dimers embedded not in vacuum,
but in the natural environment of the molecular crys-
tal. This immediately raises the issue of treating a non-
periodic, inﬁnite system in DFT. In practice, one has to
use supercell calculations with periodic boundary condi-
tions. However, these suﬀer from ﬁnite-size errors which
are particularly pronounced in the case at hand, as can
be seen from the large scatter of 0.1-0.3 eV of the uncor-
rected CT energies in Fig. 4 (blue bars). This is a con-
sequence of the large dipole moments of the CT conﬁgu-
rations, resulting in signiﬁcant dipole-dipole interactions
between periodic images. The problem is expected to be
even more pronounced in systems with either larger CT-
dipoles, like biological photo-reaction centres, or smaller
polarisabilities (e.g. due to smaller pi-systems).

We address this problem by deriving an energy cor-
rection that cancels the spurious interactions. We apply
this correction to a range of calculations using supercells
of varying shapes and sizes to demonstrate consistency
of the method. The largest supercell considered has di-
mensions 3 × 3 × 2, or 18 unit cells (1368 atoms).

Dipole-dipole correction

5

Periodic DFT codes employ the Ewald formula [62]
to evaluate the electrostatic energy. The central idea is a
splitting of the solution of Poisson’s equation (cid:52)ϕ = −4πρ
into parts that converge rapidly in real and reciprocal
space, respectively. The splitting is controlled by an in-
verse length scale η, called Ewald’s parameter.

If metallic boundary conditions are used (i.e. vanishing
surface term), as is commonly the case, the total energy
of an isolated system with a net dipole converges rela-
tively slowly (∼ V
−1
cell ) with the size of the simulation cell
due to dipole-dipole interactions between periodic im-
ages. Makov & Payne showed that a better degree of
convergence (∼ V
) can be achieved by subtracting a
dipole term from the Ewald energy [63]:

where P is the total dipole moment of the simulation cell.
The Makov & Payne result is only valid for cubic cells.
If the aperiodic system to be studied is embedded in an
isotropic dielectric one can apply the phenomenological
approach by Leslie & Gillan [64]. Here the dipole-dipole
interaction is reduced by the dielectric constant of the
dielectric, i.e.

Edip = − 2π

In order to be useful for CT states in pentacene super-
cells it is necessary to generalise these results to arbitrary
cell shapes and, crucially, anisotropic dielectrics [65–67].
To achieve the ﬁrst step we can employ the following
expression by Kantorovich which is valid for general pe-
riodic cells and can obtained by evaluating the Ewald
formula for a periodic lattice of point dipoles [68]:

If the dipoles are embedded in an anisotropic dielec-
tric we need to modify Poisson’s equation by substi-
tuting (cid:52) → ∇t∇, where  is the dielectric tensor of

the medium. Now it turns out that in order to pre-
serve the structure of the Ewald formula it is necessary
to split the charge distribution anisotropically. This is
achieved by inserting the inverse dielectric tensor in the
exponential of the Gaussian smearing function, namely

exp(−η2|r|2) → exp(−η2rt−1r)/(cid:112)det . Using this sub-

stitution the solution of the (real space) Poisson equation
for the smeared charge can be reduced to the isotropic
case by a change of variables.
In the reciprocal space
term the denominator transforms in conjunction with the
Poisson equation as |k|2 → ktk. In addition, the Fourier
transform of the modiﬁed Gaussian smearing function is
now given by exp(−ktk/4η2).

All in all, a structurally identical expression for the
dipole contribution is obtained, the only diﬀerence being

an overall factor of 1/(cid:112)det  and linear transformations

of the direct and reciprocal vectors:

The actual dielectric tensor is assumed to be obtained
by a uniform scaling  = c · DFPT. The scaling accounts
for the overestimation of screening due to the band-gap
error, as previously discussed. By using a single scal-
ing parameter c we employ the simplifying assumption
that the overscreening of DFPT is isotropic. The dipole
moments were taken from dimer cDFT calculations in

0.378. The eﬀect of the correction using this value of c for
the three cases is shown graphically in Fig. 4. We note
that the value of c is in approximate agreement with the
ratio of the DFT gap of ∼ 0.8 eV and to the quasiparticle

theory [23], as might be expected.

Having applied Eq. (14), for the herringbone dimer we
obtain a corrected mean energies of 2.01 eV and 2.04 eV,
respectively. The parallel dimer yields a mean energy
of 2.10 eV. The spread of corrected energies is down to
0.03-0.08 eV, a reduction by a factor of 3-4, demonstrat-
ing the success of the method. The signiﬁcantly larger
spread of values in the parallel dimer compared to the
herringbone dimer is a result of enhanced dipole interac-
tion between periodic images. This is due to the fact that
the dimer (and hence dipole) is aligned with the crystal
lattice (along lattice vector b, cf. Fig. 1).

V. DISCUSSION

As elaborated above, the empirical parameter c in the
method accounts for the overscreening of DFPT with lo-
cal functionals. There are additional uncertainties due to
the fact that the separation of periodic images is small,
implying that the supercell calculations still exhibit a rel-
atively high density of electron-hole pairs. This can mod-
ify the dielectric properties. Further errors may stem
from higher-order electrostatic corrections as a result of
the fact that the CT conﬁgurations considered take up
a signiﬁcant portions of the supercells and hence do not
constitute perfectly point-like dipoles. All these eﬀects
are integrated in the c parameter. The remaining spread
of energies is presumably related to residuals of these
sources of error which cannot be eliminated with the sin-
gle c parameter.

It is apparent that the dipole-corrected energies are
essentially degenerate with those obtained for the 10-
molecule cluster, within the quoted precision of 10 meV
(cf. Table II). Presuming this holds for still-larger clus-
ters, this result demonstrates the validity of the cluster
approximation for molecular crystals of pentacene and
likely a range of similar molecules (eg. tetracene). In case
where the molecular unit of a molecular crystal has a net
dipole, the cluster approach in vacuum would incur sig-
niﬁcant diﬃculties due to the unscreened net-dipole [70].
The current approach, in employing periodic boundary
conditions, would not encounter such problems.

We observe that aggregation has a twofold eﬀect on CT
energies in the pentacene molecular crystal: an overall
downshift, and an assimilation of the diﬀerent CT con-
ﬁgurations considered. The latter is particularly striking
in the herringbone dimer, where the initial splitting of
nearly 0.7 eV in isolation is reduced to only a few 10 meV
when embedded in the crystal. Interestingly, the align-
ment of the three CT energies also changes. In the iso-
lated dimers, the parallel CT energy is situated between
the two herringbone energies, whereas in the crystal the
parallel energy is slightly above the two (now nearly de-
generate) herringbone energies.

We also note that although our calculations employ
the computationally cheap LDA functional they do not

7

appear to suﬀer from a systematic underestimation of
excitation energies relative to those calculated with
higher levels of theory. This observation can be ratio-
nalised by noting that in cDFT the excited electron or-
bital is fully occupied. No DFT eigenvalues of unoc-
cupied orbitals which are subject to large systematic
underestimation enter the calculation. TDDFT with
local exchange requires computationally expensive and
parameter-dependent range-separated hybrid functionals
in order to yield CT energies that are not severely under-
estimated [21, 22]. By contrast, using the novel combina-
tion of linear-scaling methodology with projector-based
cDFT, we are able to perform relatively cheap calcula-
tions which scale well to large system sizes (1368 atoms,
in this work).

We further note that the relatively low CT energies in
the crystal of just above 2 eV put them on the lower end of
experimental estimates [19]. They are in line with previ-
ous theoretical results indicating a signiﬁcant admixture
of CT-like components into the lowest singlet exciton in
pentacene [71–73]. The low energies also lend support to
the notion that a CT-mediated ‘superexchange’ mecha-
nism can play a crucial role in ultrafast ﬁssion [10, 16–18].
Our procedure should also be transferable to other sys-
tems in which CT states are situated in a complex screen-
ing environment. These include (but are not limited to)
a variety of organic materials for organic photovoltaics
and optoelectronics/spintronics.

At this point there remain a number of limitations that
need to be addressed by future work. Our method as
presented in this work relies on the system in question
exhibiting suﬃciently homogeneous dielectric properties
which can be approximated by a single dielectric ten-
sor. Furthermore, the cDFT approach necessitates prior
knowledge of the excited state structure such that appro-
priate donor and acceptor regions can be deﬁned. An-
other current drawback is the requirement of performing
calculations on a range of supercells for the purpose of
the single parameter ﬁt, increasing computational cost.
This limitation may be overcome by using a more accu-
rate functional (or higher-level theory than DFT) for the
response calculation, provided that the unit cell is not so
large as to make this computationally infeasible.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have demonstrated the application
of (linear-scaling) constrained DFT to charge-transfer
states in the pentacene molecular crystal. Our results for
isolated dimers are in reasonable agreement with higher-
level theory calculations from the literature. Further-
more, we have used cluster calculations to illustrate the
transition to the crystal limit, showing that CT ener-
gies are lowered both by screening and the formation of
bands. We have devised a scheme based on periodic su-
percell calculations in combination with a dipole correc-
tion in order to establish the limit of the inﬁnite molec-

ular crystal. Our dipole correction method is novel in
that it is applicable to very general systems (non-cubic
with anisotropic dielectric properties). It is also of signif-
icant interest that in spite of the high-polarity of the CT
conﬁgurations, the excellent agreement between results
for the cluster approximation and for the crystal limit
reveals unexpectedly high screening capability for pen-
tacene, with important consequences for the modelling
of pentacene interfaces and ﬁlm stuctural imperfections.
