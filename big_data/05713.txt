Abstract

It is established that physical observables in local quantum ﬁeld theories should be invariant under
invertible ﬁeld redeﬁnitions. It is then expected that this statement should be true for the entanglement
entropy and moreover that, via the gauge/gravity correspondence, the recipe for computing entanglement
entropy holographically should also be invariant under ﬁeld redeﬁnitions in the gravity side. We use this
fact to ﬁx the recipe for computing holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) for f (R, Rµν ) theories
which could be mapped to Einstein gravity. An outcome of our prescription is that the minimal surfaces
for the f (R, Rµν ) theories always have vanishing trace of extrinsic curvature and that the HEE may be
evaluated using the Wald entropy functional. We show that similar results follows from the FPS and
Dong HEE functionals, for Einstein manifold backgrounds in f (R, Rµν ) theories.

Hilbert space of local ﬁeld theories is speciﬁed with all possible ﬁeld conﬁgurations on a given constant time
slice. Alternatively, via the operator-state correspondence, one may use the set of all possible local operators
at a given neighborhood of compact support to specify the Hilbert space. One of the implications of the
previous statement, which becomes more clear in the path integral formulation of quantum ﬁeld theories, is
ﬁeld redeﬁnition invariance of physical observables. Explicitly, let us consider a local ﬁeld theory described
with generic set of ﬁelds Φ(x). We may choose to describe the same theory with ˜Φ(x) = ˜Φ[Φ(x)]. Here
we will always assume that this ﬁeld redeﬁnition map is invertible, i.e. the Jacobian of the transformation
is nonzero. The ﬁeld redeﬁnition invariance then states that there should be a one-to-one correspondence
between physical observables of the theory in Φ and in ˜Φ-descriptions; ﬁeld redeﬁnitions are to be viewed
as change of basis in the Hilbert space and the physical observables should be independent of the choice of
basis. A speciﬁc but very important case of the ﬁeld redeﬁnition invariance concerns the S-matrix elements
which are related to the set of n-point (n ≥ 2) functions of all local operators through the standard LSZ
theorem, see [1] for the proof and further discussions.

Local quantum ﬁeld theories have local or non-local physical observables. The best known non-local
physical observables are Wilson or Polyakov loops in gauge theories. However, recent developments have
emphasized on entanglement or Renyi entropy or other information theoretic quantities, as other non-local

1

physical observables (see for example [2]). Since in this work we will be mainly concerned with the entan-
glement entropy let us focus on this non-local observable. The entanglement entropy is computed between
two parts of the Hilbert space. For example, let us suppose that the Hilbert space H is divided into two
mutually exclusive parts HA and HB, i.e. H = HA ⊗ HB. One may then deﬁne a reduced density matrix
over HA, ρA, by integrating out states in HB. The entanglement entropy between A and B parts is then
deﬁned as the von Neumann entropy of ρA. For a given local ﬁeld theory, whose Hilbert space is speciﬁed
by ﬁeld conﬁgurations on constant time slices, there is a one-to-one relation between points on the constant
time slice and the Hilbert space. In this case HA and HB regions can have a direct geometric realization:
Let us divide the constant time slice into two regions VA and VB which are separated by a codimension two
surface ∂VA. A well known and established result in the local free quantum ﬁeld theories is that the leading
term in the entanglement entropy between these two regions is proportional to the area of ∂VA, A, in units
of the UV cutoﬀ of the theory [3,4]. This result which is obtained for free ﬁeld theory with no excitations can
be extended to weakly coupled theories and with generic perturbative excitations on the background ﬁeld
theory. Away from the weakly coupled ﬁxed point, there is no direct ﬁeld theory computation (applicable
to generic ﬁeld theories, beyond 2d CFT’s) for calculating the entanglement entropy.

Following the steps of computation of entanglement entropy for local quantum ﬁeld theories, one can
check that like the local observables, entanglement entropy, mutual and multipartite information, and relative
entropy should also be invariant under local ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, as ﬁeld redeﬁnition is a change of basis in the
Hilbert space and as long as it does not tamper with the geometric partitioning of the Hilbert space through
dividing a constant time slice into two regions, it should not alter the outcome of trace over B and then A
parts.

On the other hand, one may use the AdS/CFT setting (or its “more relaxed version” gauge/gravity
correspondence) to compute physical observables in strongly coupled ﬁeld theories (at large N ). Ryu and
Takayanagi (RT) in their seminal paper [5] made the ﬁrst such proposal for computing entanglement entropy
holographically. The RT proposal was extended to non-static backgrounds (the HRT proposal) [6]. The
essence of RT (or HRT) proposal is very elegant and simple: The entanglement entropy associated with a
region VA at the AdS boundary is the area of the minimal (or extremal) surface whose boundary is anchored
to the AdS boundary at ∂VA, divided by 4GN . This proposal can be extended to any asymptotically
AdS geometry, in particular asymptotically AdS black holes, corresponding to ﬁeld theories at non-zero
temperature [5, 7]. The (H)RT proposal has successfully passed several non-trivial checks [6–8] and has
been convincingly argued to be the right proposal for computing entanglement entropy within the AdS/CFT
framework [9].

The RT and HRT proposals are made for Einstein gravity theory (plus minimally coupled matter ﬁelds).
However, it is a well-known fact that in a semi-classical regime the Lagrangian of gravity theories would
involve higher derivative terms, higher powers of Riemann curvature (and in general the derivatives of
Riemann). These corrections within string theory setting, after using (super)gravity ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, can
generically be brought to the form of Lovelock theories order by order in an α′ expansion [10–12]. In spite
of the fact that higher derivative gravity theories generically have ghosts, it is of theoretical interest to
extend the Holographic Entanglement Entropy (HEE) recipes to generic higher derivative cases. There have
been several papers already on the topic and there are some diﬀerent proposal and recipes, e.g. the FPS
proposal [13], de Boer et al. and Hung et al. proposal [14, 15], the proposal by Dong and Camps [16, 17] and
other works on the topic e.g. [18–27].

One of the fundamental statements in the AdS/CFT duality is that the VEV of operators in the ﬁeld
theory is related to the value of the bulk (gravity) ﬁelds at the boundary of AdS [28] (see also the ﬁrst
section of the lecture notes [29]). This picture then implies that ﬁeld redeﬁnition in the ﬁeld theory side,
which is the same as a change of basis in the space of ﬁeld theory operators, should translate into a ﬁeld
redeﬁnition in the gravity side. Of course, while the precise mapping between the two ﬁeld redeﬁnitions
could be complicated, for what concerns us here, the existence of a ﬁeld redeﬁnition in the gravity side is
enough. Recalling the above statements in the ﬁeld theory side one would then expect that the RT or HRT
proposals, which are recipes for computing entanglement entropy in the gravity side, should also be ﬁeld
redeﬁnition invariant.

2

Under a generic ﬁeld redeﬁnition in a gravity theory the form of the action would in general change.
For example, it is well known that a generic f (R) theory of gravity can be mapped onto a scalar-Einstein
theory upon an appropriately chosen ﬁeld redeﬁnition [30]. Of course, this mapping and ﬁeld redeﬁnition is
well-deﬁned if the map is invertible and one should check this condition on each solution of the theory to
ensure that we have a well-deﬁned mapping. One may then use the above line of reasoning to extend the
basic RT and HRT proposals which were made for Einstein gravity theory, to more general gravity theories.
Explicitly our guiding principle is that: For any higher derivative gravity theory which can be mapped
to Einstein gravity upon a ﬁeld redeﬁnition we have a way to ﬁx the HEE recipe. Here we will use the
terminology of “Einstein-like” theory, for the gravity theories which could be mapped to Einstein gravity
upon ﬁeld redeﬁnitions. In other wording, our recipe is to map an “Einstein-like” theory to the Einstein
frame and use RT or HRT proposals and map it back to the original theory. In this way we get the HEE
proposal for such higher derivative gravity theories, using the RT or HRT proposals as reference points.

Before moving to the speciﬁc application and exploration of the above guiding principle, it is worth noting
a parallel and closely related discussion on the black hole (thermal) entropy. In his seminal paper [31], R.
Wald gave a general formula for computing the entropy associated with a black hole solution to a generic
gravity theory the action of which is a general diﬀeomorphism invariant functional of Riemann curvature
and its covariant derivatives, and the metric. In this formulation black hole entropy was introduced as the
Noether-Wald charge associated with the Killing vector ﬁeld generating the (Killing) horizon. In a paper
which was published shortly after Wald’s paper [32], it was argued that black hole and hence Wald’s entropy
formula, should be invariant under ﬁeld redeﬁnitions of the sort discussed above (see also [33]). So, in this
sense our new input here is to extend similar idea to more general case of the (holographic) entanglement
entropy. We note that, horizon is in fact a particular minimal (extremal) surface with vanishing trace of
extrinsic curvature; the horizon can be a disconnected part of a minimal (extremal) surface [34, 35]. This
latter, among other things, provides another cross-check for any proposal for computing HEE in generic
higher derivative gravity theory: the “HEE functional” (as it is known in the terminology of the ﬁeld) should
reduce to Wald’s entropy formula when computed on the Killing horizons.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we consider general modiﬁed gravity theories with
Lagrangians of the form f (R, Rµν) and discuss the ﬁeld redeﬁnition which maps the theory onto Einstein-
Hilbert theory. In section 3, we use the ﬁeld redeﬁnitions of the previous section to ﬁx the HEE functional
for f (R, Rµν) theories. In section 4, we compare our proposal and the other proposals for computing HEE
in the literature. The last section is devoted to open questions and the outlook. In two Appendices we have
provided some more detailed analysis on the comparison between our method and the functionals existing
in the literature and also discussed some examples to show how our method works explicitly and to show
the matching with the other recipes.

f (Ric) theories are “Einstien-like”, a review

In this work we will consider metric-compatible, torsion-free connections, within metric formulation of gravity.
We will brieﬂy discuss more general cases in the discussion section. In this case, Riemann curvature has
d2(d2 − 1)/12 independent components in d dimensions and the Riemann curvature may be decomposed
into Ricci curvature Rµν and the Weyl curvature Wαβµν . Ricci tensor is symmetric and has d(d + 1)/2
components and the rest of d(d + 1)(d + 2)(d − 3)/12 components are in Weyl tensor, which is traceless over
all indices.

In this section we explore a family of higher derivative gravity theories which could be mapped to Einstein
gravity upon appropriate ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, i.e. the higher derivative theories which ﬁt within our deﬁnition
of “Einstein-like” theories. The above simple counting, noting that metric is also a symmetric rank two
tensor and has the same number of degrees of freedom as Ricci tensor, suggests that one should be able to
map f (Ric) onto Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. This area has of course been explored in many papers in the
literature, e.g. in [30, 36–39]. In this section we review such mappings, as discussed in the aforementioned
papers.

2.1 From f (R) to Einstien-Hilbert

The most general action for a f (R) gravity is given by

I1 =

1

2κ2 Z dd+1xp|g|(cid:2)f (R) + Lmatter(j1gµν, φ)(cid:3) ,

(2.1)

where φ in the second term denotes generic matter ﬁelds and the matter sector do not contain second
derivative of the metric.1 The equation of motion for the above action is given by

(Rµν + gµν (cid:3) − ∇µ∇ν) f′(R) −

1
2

gµνf (R) = Tµν ,

(2.2)

δ√gLmatter

where Tµν = − 1√g
. We then introduce a new scalar ﬁeld Φ, such that Φ = R. This latter may be
added to the action using a Lagrange multiplier λ, leading to action in which the equation of motion for Φ
is given by λ = f′(Φ). Next, after the Weyl scaling,

δgµν

the action (2.1) becomes

gµν = e2σ ¯gµν,

(2.3)

I2 =

where covariant derivative ∇ is deﬁned for metric ¯gµν. In order to extract the Einstein part of the above
action one may consider the following redeﬁnitions

f′(Φ) =

(2.4)

(2.5)

where from (2.4) one may solve Φ for ϕ. Some brief comments are in order [36]:

• κ is not necessarily directly related to d + 1 dimensional Newton constant, GN by deﬁnition is the
coeﬃcient in front of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity action. In particular, we note that GN is related to
κ through (2.4) and that it is positive if f′(Φ) is positive on a given proﬁle for Φ. This latter is of
course determined by the ﬁeld equations; acceptable solutions are those with f′(Φ) > 0.

• The equivalence of f (R) and Einstein-scalar theory is an on-shell statement, i.e., it maps any given
solution of the f (R) theory (2.1) to Einstein-scalar theory (2.5). Importantly, one should check that
the map is invertible (on the solutions of the e.o.m.).

• For the special case of f (Φ) = λΦn,

V (ϕ) = V0eβΦ,

.

For the special case of Einstein-Hilbert action with n = 1, as we expect, the potential is simply zero
and the scalar Φ should also be set to a constant (cf. (2.4)). For f (Φ) = λΦn, n ≥ 1 cases, background

1jkT means kth order jet prolongation of T . Roughly, it denotes the set of T and partial derivatives of T up to kth order.

solutions with R = 0 would correspond to ϕ = ∞ cases and the map in not invertible; i.e. these
theories may have solutions which are not captured through our mapping. The R2 case has been
recently studied in [40].

2.2 From f (Ric) to Einstein-Hilbert

Consider the following gravity action

I =

1

2κ2 Z dd+1xp|g|(cid:2)f (Ric) + Lmatter(j1gµν, Φ)(cid:3)

(2.6)

where f (Ric) ≡ f (Rµν , gµν) is the most general scalar function which only depends on Ricci tensor and
metric. Therefore, f (Ric) = f (Rµ
are related to each other by a factor of Ricci tensor.
We also consider the matter ﬁelds contribution Lmatter due to some matter ﬁelds Φ (not necessary scalars).
In general, this action leads to a fourth order ﬁeld equation for metric gµν

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

corresponding to the Einstein theory and in the presence of extra matter ﬁeld associated to the original
metric gµν. This action leads to a second order ﬁeld equation for the new metric ¯gµν [41]. Note that the
Lmatter(j1¯g, j1g, Φ) term now contains terms like

αβQσ

σρ) ,

βν =

Qα

gασ

2 (cid:0) ¯∇νgσβ + ¯∇βgσν − ¯∇σgαβ(cid:1) .

Therefore, the action (2.10) describes two spin two ﬁelds, a massless graviton represented through ¯gµν and
a generically massive spin two coming from gαβ. This latter may generically have negative kinetic term (a
ghost-like degree of freedom).

Given the above mapping some comments are in order:

• For the Einstein-Hilbert action, one may readily check that, as expected, (2.8) reduces to ¯gµν = gµν .
• One can show that in the case of f (Ric) = f (R)curvature tensors the above procedure reduces to
what was discussed in Sec. 2.1. In this case one ﬁnds F µν = f′(R)gµν and by using (2.8) we have
d−1 gµν . On the other hand combining (2.3) and (2.4) and replacing κ2 with 8πGd+1 in
¯gµν = f′(R)
(2.10) leads to ¯gµν = f′(R)

d−1 gµν.

• Note that ¯gµν is governed by a second order ﬁeld equation (the usual Einstein equation).

In fact,
through introducing the new ﬁeld ¯gµν, we have doubled dynamical ﬁelds to ¯gµν and gµν and the fourth
order ﬁeld equation (2.7) is now replaced with two second order equations.

• Recalling the discussion in the opening of this section, we learn that we cannot replace Weyl or Riemann
curvature tensors by a ﬁeld redeﬁnition of the kind used for f (R) or f (Ric) theories, as Riemann and
Weyl tensors are not in simple spin s representation of the Lorentz group.

3 Field redeﬁntions and holographic entanglement entropy

The RT proposal [5]: For a d dimensional CFT with an Einstein-Hilbert gravity dual, the entanglement
entropy SE associated with a region VA bounded with the compact d − 2 dimensional space ∂VA, may be
computed “holographically” minimizing the functional

SEE =

4Gd+1 ZγA

dd−1ξ√¯γ,

(3.1)

over the d − 1 dimensional spacelike surfaces ¯γ which intersect causal boundary of AdSd+1 on ∂VA. ¯γab
denotes the induced metric on the minimal surface ¯γ. The minimal surface ¯γ may be denoted through the
embedding equations

xµ = xµ(ξa),

µ = 1, 2,··· d, a = 1, 2,··· , d − 1

or alternatively through Ψi(xµ) = 0 which denotes a d−1 dimensional surface with normal vector ni
The induced metric is then

µ = ∂µΨi.

¯γab = gµν

∂xµ
∂ξa

∂xν
∂ξb ,

(3.2)

or alternatively is given through gµν − ni
ﬁx ¯γ. This latter states that the RT minimal surface should have vanishing extrinsic curvature.

ν . The RT proposal prescribes minimizing the functional (3.1) to

µni

The RT proposal for the Holographic Entanglement Entropy (HEE) may be used for any static Asymp-
totically AdSd+1 (AAdSd+1) backgrounds and the minimal surfaces ¯γ reside on constant time slices in these
backgrounds. The shape of the minimal surface, the induced metric ¯γab, and hence the entanglement entropy
SE depend on the ∂VA as well as the background metric. This proposal has been used to computed the
entanglement entropy for various entangling region shapes (e.g. a sphere, strip or cylinder) and many AAdS
backgrounds e.g. AdS-black holes [7]. Moreover, the RT proposal has been extended to the “HRT proposal”
for non-static and stationary backgrounds [6]. In the latter cases the minimal surface is replaced with an
“extremal surface” with a very similar construction.

We stress again that this functional only works for Einstein theory of gravity with possibly other minimally
coupled matter ﬁelds. In the rest of this section, we show that one may use ﬁeld redeﬁnition invariance to
obtain a proposal for computing the HEE for more general Einstein-like theories. The general framework is
of course remaining the same as the RT, namely the HEE is obtained through minimizing a functional over
a minimal surface ¯γ, and our task is to ﬁnd the functional.

3.1 Holographic entanglement entropy functional for f (R)

Let us suppose that there exists a d dimensional (conformal) ﬁeld theory which is dual to an f (R) gravity
theory coupled to some matter ﬁelds, with the action of the form (2.1). To obtain the functional for computing
HEE for this theory we note that we may use the RT proposal for the equivalent Einstein-scalar theory (2.5).
This will then allow us to provide the HEE functional directly for the f (R) theory. Explicitly, consider the
RT functional for theory (2.5) as the starting point

4Gd+1 Z dd−1ξ√¯γ.

(3.3)

Now using (2.3) and (3.2), we can replace induced metric ¯γ with γ where the latter one is deﬁned on
background gµν. Using this fact, the holographic entanglement entropy for f (R) theory is given by

SEE =

4Gd+1 Z dd−1ξ e(1−d)σ√γ
κ2 Z dd−1ξ f′(R)√γ,

4π

(3.4)

where in the last equality we used (2.4). As we see the function f appears directly in the HEE functional
and hence enters directly in the minimal surface γ.

One may alternatively minimize the functional (3.4) to ﬁnd the minimal surface and by evaluating the
function over this minimal surface compute the HEE. One can then readily see that this minimal surface
should have vanishing trace of extrinsic curvature. This latter result, may also be argued for, recalling
that the mapping from f (R) to Einstein-frame does not change the fact that trace of extrinsic curvature of
minimal surface for RT proposal (for Einstein-Hilbert theory) is zero. To show the above explicitly, we have
discussed some diﬀerent examples in the appendix.

3.2 Holographic entanglement entropy functional for f (Ric)

We can generalize the previous analysis to obtain entanglement entropy functional for an f (Ric) theory from
the RT functional. Starting from (2.8), we learn that

¯γ = |g| det (F µν ) det (F−1
ab ),

where F−1

is the induced-inverted F µν , explicitly

F−1
ab ≡ (F−1)µν

∂xν
∂ξb ,

(3.5)

(3.6)

Note in the above, the induced metric ¯γ should be viewed as a function of the transformed (redeﬁned) metric
¯g deﬁned in (2.8) and that the latter is a function of F µν (2.9).

Although we implicitly have our proposed functional, one cannot proceed further analytically for general

cases. We shall hence restrict ourselves to two cases:

1. Cases which are perturbations around Einstein-Hilbert theory, with f (Ric) = R−2Λ+λ ˜f (Ric)+O(λ2).
2. The general f (Ric) theory which admits an Einstein manifold solution and compute the HEE for these

backgrounds for which Rµν = R

d+1 gµν .

1. Perturbative f (Ric). Let us assume f (Ric) as a modiﬁed version of Einstein-Hilbert action where
higher curvature terms appear as a perturbation and keep this correction up to the ﬁrst order

For this case

where ˜Fab is the tensor ˜Fµν induced on the minimal surface and γab is the inverse of induced metric γab.

over by powers of metric gµν , we learn that for the Einstein manifold vacuum solutions

As a cross-check one can show that this result produces the correct universal term of entanglement
entropy. To see this, we recall that the coeﬃcient of the universal part of the entanglement entropy in an
even dimensional CFTd is related to central charges appearing in the trace anomaly of energy-momentum

tensor, in 2d [43, 44] and in 4d [45]. 3 The form of (3.15) functional for f (Ric) theory shows this coeﬃcient
is the same as Einstein gravity up to an overall constant factor proportional to f (Ric)|AdS. On the other
hand, it is known that A-type trace anomaly is proportional to the on-shell value of Lagrangian evaluated on
AdSd+1 background, f (Ric)|AdS [48]. It is also known the type of anomaly which appears in the universal
term depends on the shape of entanglement region. For example in a CFT4, sphere and cylinder return a and
c in entanglement entropy, respectively [45]. However, as we already mentioned, only the a central charge
which is related to A-type anomaly, can be appear in (3.15). So, the form of functional suggests two central
charges c and a are the same for a CFT4 theories which are dual to f (Ric) gravity. Therefore, one may
conclude only Riemann tensor contributes in c − a. This result is consistent with previous studies [24, 49].

4 Comparison with other proposals

As discussed in the introduction, there are some diﬀerent proposals to extend the RT functional for compu-
tation of the HEE to higher derivative gravity theories, e.g. see [13, 16, 17, 26]. One class of such proposals
simply suggest to promote the Wald entropy formula [31, 50] to the HEE functional. This proposal is based
on the observation that (1) the RT minimal surface has a vanishing trace of extrinsic curvature and that
(2) the bifurcation surface of the Killing horizon of a stationary black hole has also a vanishing extrinsic
curvature, and that for the latter one can use Wald formula to compute the black hole entropy. If one could
show or argue that for a generic higher derivative theory the minimal surface should always have a vanishing
extrinsic curvature, then this idea could be a valid one. However, there is a priori no reason that this latter
condition should hold. So, in general one would expect the HEE functional should have some extra terms
compared to the Wald formula. In particular it has been shown that this naive idea does not always produce
the correct universal part of entanglement entropy [14, 15].

In the context of black hole entropy in higher derivative gravity theories, there is another functional by
Jacobson-Myers [32]. The JM functional which has been proposed for Lovelock gravity theories, has a term
proportional to the extrinsic curvature of the codimension two surface over which we are integrating. This
term vanishes at the bifurcation surface of the horizon and the JM functional reduces to the Wald entropy
formula. It has been shown that using this as an HEE functional yields the correct universal term in the
HEE for Lovelock theories [14, 15].

The most general HEE functional which has been proposed so far, is the one proposed by Xi Dong [16]

which is an extension of the JM entropy functional. This functional is given by

proposal reduces to the FPS proposal [13] when the Lagrangian has only curvature squared terms. Here we

To produce the HEE these functionals are to be computed on an “appropriate” extremal surface. There
are two methods to ﬁnd this extremal surface [16]: using the “conical boundary conditions” method [9], or
minimizing (extremizing) the functional, supplemented by “causality constraints” [51, 52]. Although, it is
believed that these two methods should lead to the same extremal surface, to our knowledge there is no
generic and ambiguity-free proof of it. Moreover, it has been shown that the HEE computed with the RT
proposal satisﬁes subadditivity constraints [8]. It is straightforward to generalize arguments of [8] and show
that this result also holds for any HEE functional with extremization method. We, however, note that only
one of the extremizing surfaces leads to the correct entanglement entropy.

One may work out the equations governing the extremal surface from variation of the functional (4.1). The
details of such a computation may be found in [22] and we have reviewed in the appendix A. This equation
is generically an order four equation, involving Laplacian and higher powers of the extrinsic curvature. Here
we give the result for the PFS functional (4.4) in the α3 = 0 case, for the Einstein manifolds (3.11):

One may repeat similar analysis for the general case. Although a complicated equation, one may check
that for the Einstein manifold solutions to the gravity theories which do not involve Riemann curvature,
i.e. the f (R, Rµν ) family, surfaces with vanishing trace of extrinsic curvature are always a solution (see
the appendix A.2).
In our method which is based on mapping to Einstein theory, this latter is a direct
outcome, as this is a property of the RT minimal surface which is preserved under our mapping. We have
indeed checked explicitly these statements for many diﬀerent examples in various diﬀerent theories. We have
presented some of those examples in the Appendix B.

5 Summary and discussion

In this work we analyzed the implications of ﬁeld redeﬁnition invariance of physical observables in the local
quantum ﬁeld theories and their possible gravity duals, for the entanglement entropy. We used this idea as
a method ﬁx the proposal for computing entanglement entropy for ﬁeld theories with gravity duals. Such
gravity duals may in general be a higher derivative gravity theory. Using the fact that any theory of gravity
described by f (R, Rµν) Lagrangian can be (formally) mapped onto an Einstein-Hilbert theory upon a ﬁeld
redeﬁnition, and the RT proposal for the computation of entanglement entropy in Einstein-Hilbert gravity,
we found the recipe for computing entanglement entropy holographically for f (R, Rµν) theories.

4As a side remark, note that for α2, α3 > 0, the terms proportional to extrinsic curvature in (4.4) contribute with a negative

sign.

10

We discussed that our “ﬁeld redeﬁnition based” proposal passes the two tests any such HEE functional

is expected to pass:
i) it should reduce to the Wald formula when computed on horizon bifurcation surfaces,
ii) it should correctly reproduce the universal terms expected to be present in the (H)EE expression.
As a check for our analysis, we discussed that our functional reproduces the results of other existing proposals
e.g. [13, 16, 17], for the class of f (R, Rµν) theories, and hence passes these two tests.

Our proposal, among other things, implies that for the class of f (R, Rµν ) theories the minimal surface
should always have vanishing trace of extrinsic curvature and that for these cases the Dong functional should
reduce to the Wald entropy formula.5 Our arguments would hence provide a new insight on the analysis
of [52] and the intricate issues with the choice of minimal surfaces in the higher derivative theories.

Our method, as discussed here, does not in general cover the most general fourth order gravity theories,
and in particular the interesting case of Lovelock theories, as the latter always involves powers of Riemann
as well. However, we would like to make two comments on such cases:

• Since Riemann curvature tensor can be written in terms of Ricci tensor in three dimensional cases,
our method captures the most general parity-conserving three dimensional case.6 However, we expect
it should be possible to extend our method to the general cases with both parity even and odd parts,
where the even-parity part of any 3d gravity theory is mapped onto the Einstein-Hilbert and the
odd-parity part to simple gravitational Chern-Simons. We shall explore this in future works.

• It is known that f (R, Rµν ) theories in the linearized regime, generically, involve a massless and a
massive spin two degrees of freedom. Our ﬁeld redeﬁnition, was used to disentangle these two degrees
of freedom such that the massless graviton is essentially described by our new metric in the Einstein
frame.7 Presence of a massless and a massive spin two degree of freedom is also a generic property of
more general L(R, Rµν, Rνµαβ) theories.8 One would hence in principle expect that the ﬁeld redeﬁnition
method should also work for more general theories. It would be desirable to explore this direction.

One of the implicit features of the Wald entropy formula or the HEE functional proposals, like the RT or
that of Dong, is that the entropy only involves the gravitational part of the action. Moreover, our analysis
reveals another interesting fact:
for the Einstein-like theories, this is only the “massless spin-two”, the
Einstein-Hilbert part, which determines the entropy. On the other hand, the “matter” part would appear
through the background metric. However, generically, one may have theories in which there is no clear
distinction between the gravity and the matter parts. A simple example is theories involving the conformal
mass term. Another class which has recently attracted some interest is the Horndeski theories [56], where
the ﬁeld equations are still second order and the theory is ghost-free. It is interesting to explore the HEE
proposals, and in particular, our ﬁeld redeﬁnition method, for these theories.

Finally, we would like to point out that, although in our analysis here we only considered entanglement
entropy, other information theoretic measures, like relative entropy, mutual information, multi-partite en-
tanglement, should also be ﬁeld redeﬁnition invariant. It would be interesting to explore implications of ﬁeld
redeﬁnition invariance for these other observables.

5We could only explicitly prove this latter for the existing HEE proposals on Einstein manifold backgrounds. However, our

method implies that this result should be true for more general backgrounds solutions of f (R, Rµν ) theories.

6In three dimensions we can have the gravitational Chern-Simons term, e.g. as in chiral gravity theories [53,54]. Our method
which maps theories to Einstein-Hilbert, will only capture the parity-even parts, like the NMG theory [55] which is discussed
in the appendix.

7It is also known that such higher derivative theories of gravity generically have ghosts. With our mapping, we are choosing
the overall sign of our action such that the massless graviton is not the ghost degree of freedom. In our analysis this is reﬂected
in the fact that in the Einstein frame the Newton constant has the positive sign.

8Lovelock theories are special in the sense that, by construction, the ﬁeld equations are second order and hence they only

involve a massless graviton in the linearized level.

A More detailed comparison with other proposals

In this appendix we provide more details of computations needed for the comparison of our results and
the FPS and Dong proposals. We will ﬁrst present the simpler case of FPS proposal which is suited for
curvature-squared gravity theories and then discuss the more general case of Dong proposal. As mentioned,
the Dong proposal reproduces the FPS functional. Our goal in this appendix is to show that surfaces with
K = 0 are always solution to the equations of motion for extremal surfaces derived from the FPS or Dong
functionals for Einstein manifold background solutions to the f (R, Rµν) gravity theory.

A.1 Comparison with the FPS proposal

L2 + L2α1

As the starter, let us consider the α2 = α3 = 0 case, where we deal with an f (R) theory with f (R) =
R + d(d−1)
2 R2. One may readily show that the FPS functional (4.4) is exactly equal to (3.4). It is also
useful to note that two metrics ¯gµν and gµν are related by the conformal map introduced in (2.8). Therefore,
the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the minimal surface vanishes before and after this mapping.

For the more general case of α2 6= 0 (still α3 = 0), one can again directly check this by minimizing the

functional (3.4) and apply the methods of section 3.2. Below, we present a sample such computation.

Perturbative analysis. Recall that in this case we had

˜Fµν = L2(α1Rgµν + α2Rµν )

and hence,

where γµν = gµν − nµ

˜F = L2(α2 + (d + 1)α1)R,

(A.1)

(A.2)

In the absence of the anomalous term (trace of extrinsic curvature), the above result is the same as FPS
functional (4.4). One can show that the contribution of the extrinsic curvature terms will always be of the
second order in αi. The argument is as follows: As we already pointed out the trace of extrinsic curvature of
the minimal surface is zero for the Einstein theory and in the absence of higher derivative corrections [6] and
hence Ki will necessarily be (at least) of the order αi. Therefore, the last term in (4.4) will not contribute
to the leading order analysis.9

9For higher curvature theory in general the extremal surface will not necessarily have vanishing extrinsic curvature Ki. Note
also that as was shown in [21, 22] the surface extremizing the FPS functional does not necessarily coincide with the surface
determined by the generalized entropy method of [9]. Some authors choose a speciﬁc limiting procedure to match these two
methods at least for Lovelock theories [16, 19]. See [27] for another approach to this problem.

Einstein manifold backgrounds. Although one may study generic backgrounds under ﬁeld redeﬁnition
invariance, for technical simplicity we restrict our analysis to Einstein manifold backgrounds. These back-
grounds include all interesting well-known geometries previously studied in the literature such as pure AdS
and AdS-Schwarzschild. For such backgrounds by choosing f (Ric) = R + d(d−1)

Minimal surface for FPS. Here we study the equation of the extremal surface to show that it always
admits Ki = 0 as a solution. Such an equation is found by extremizing the FPS functional (4.4). Using the
results of section 3 of [22], all the ingredients needed to calculate variation of (4.4) are

where following the conventions of [22] ˆ∇ denotes the covariant derivative contemptible with bulk metric
and ψi is the variation parameter.

For the case of Einstein manifolds (3.11), ˆ∇ρRµν = 0 and the two middle equations reduce to

Using these ingredients with the appropriate coeﬃcients leads to the minimal surface equation (4.5). It is
easy to see that (4.5) always admits a Ki = 0 solution. Thus for Einstein manifolds the functional (A.4)
exactly matches with (4.4). On the other hand for the case of general manifolds we have already mentioned
that due to our perturbative analysis, the extrinsic curvature contributions are at least of the order αi and
thus will not contribute to leading order of entropy.

Some comments are in order:

• The equation of surface (4.5) may admit another solution which we have not considered in our analysis.
However, the Ki = 0 solution leads to the correct universal term for EE and so we are considering it
as the appropriate choice.

• Lewkowycz and Maldacena [9] have used a diﬀerent approach to obtain the equation of the minimal
surface. They consider ﬁeld equations of the bulk metric in the vicinity of a small conical deﬁcit and
by demanding the matter stress-energy tensor to be ﬁnite, they set the coeﬃcients of divergent terms
to vanish. This condition ﬁxes the location of the extremal surface. As it is argued in [16] we expect
this procedure to be the same as variation of the EE functional.10 In the case of (4.4) one may show
that Ki = 0 is one of the Lewkowycz-Maldacena conditions [22].

10However, as it is mentioned in [16, 21, 22, 27] there are some ambiguities in taking the corresponding limits which we are

not going to discuss here.

(A.10)

For the case of Einstein manifolds the above summation leads to a R-dependent constant value which does
not participate in the variation of the entropy functional. Since the Wald contribution is independent of
the extrinsic curvature of the minimal surface, the above contribution to the minimal surface equation as

δ(√γKiKi) which was previously calculated in (A.5). One can hence deduce that Ki = 0 is a solution for

the minimal surface equation for the case of Einstein manifolds in support of our result in (A.4).

B Explicit Examples

In this appendix we work out the entanglement entropy for speciﬁc examples in higher derivative theories
for diﬀerent entangling regions with our ﬁeld redeﬁnition method. We compare our results with the existing
results in the literature. This will show how our method works in practice and also provides direct and
explicit checks for our proposal. Here we only consider examples of f (Ric) theories.

where we have used (B.2) to obtain the second equality. Naturally, one may show (B.3) is the same as
perturbative functional (A.2) after a perturbative expansion. In the following we will use this functional to
compare our result with FPS functional (4.4).

We consider a spherical entangling, i.e., ρ = ℓ region at constant time slice on the boundary. In what follows
we treat the black hole eﬀects perturbatively at leading order of m thus we parametrize the RT surface in
the bulk as ρ(z) = g0(z) + m g1(r). For this conﬁguration the FPS functional (4.4) reads as

The entangling region is deﬁned as

0 < u < H,

where H is an IR regulator. In this case since we are not able to ﬁnd the proﬁle analytically, we restrict
our analysis to the near boundary region of the pure AdSd+1 space and thus we try to ﬁnd the RT surface
assuming ρ = g(z). For such an entangling region the FPS functional (4.4) is

Indeed, as we have just seen in the case of spherical and inﬁnite strip entangling regions, in this case the
extrinsic curvature again not contribute to the on-shell FPS functional and we can compare the result with
