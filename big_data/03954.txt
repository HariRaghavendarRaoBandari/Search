Introduction

Given a partition (Ii)ℓ−1

i=0 of [0, 1] into subintervals, the Weierstrass-type function is deﬁned as

W (x) =

∞

Xn=0

λ(x)λ(τ x) · · · λ(τ n−1x) g(τ nx),

where we assume for some ε ∈ (0, 1) that

• τ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is continuous and piecewise C1+ε monotonically increasing and uniformly

expanding map with full branches,

• λ : [0, 1] → (0, 1) and g : [0, 1] → R are piecewise C1+ε, and

• λτ ′ > 1, uniformly.

Here, every ’piecewise’ is related to the intervals (Ii)ℓ−1
i=0 which are called the monotonicity intervals
of τ . In addition, the derivative of a piecewise diﬀerentiable function on Ii is deﬁned by extending
its restriction to I ◦

i on some neighbourhood of Ii.

Furthermore, we consider the randomised Weierstrass-type function as

Wϑ(x) =

∞

Xn=0

λ(x)λ(τ x) · · · λ(τ n−1x) g(τ nx + ϑn),

where ϑ = (ϑn)n∈N0 is i.i.d. to the uniform distribution on [0, 1]. Note that W can be regarded as
W0 for 0 = (0, 0, . . .). Observe that W is continuous everywhere except for a countable exceptions.
n=0 τ −n{0, 1} as we will show in Lemma 23.
If we additionally suppose that τ, λ and g are chosen so that they are continuously extensible to
functions on R/Z, then Wϑ is continuous on [0, 1] for all ϑ. However, Wϑ is typically nowhere
diﬀerentiable, as shown in [Bed89a].

In fact, possible discontinuity can only occur on S∞

Let graphWϑ := {(x, Wϑ(x)) : x ∈ [0, 1]} denote the graph of Wϑ. The box dimension of
the graph of W was discovered in [Bed89a], while its Housdorﬀ dimension is only known in some
special cases. Related to this problem, the randomised function Wϑ was studied in [Hun98] and
[MW12].

In this note, we study Hausdorﬀ spectra of the local H¨older exponent of both W and Wϑ. Our
results also related to [Bed89b], in which the local H¨older exponent of W is studied, especially
with respect to the Lebesgue measure. In addition, related to this problem, we also study the
Hausdorﬀ dimension of lifted Gibbs measures on graphWϑ.

2 Preliminaries

The inverse branches of τ are deﬁned as C1+-homeomorphisms ρi : [0, 1] → I i for i ∈ {0, . . . , ℓ − 1}
)−1, continuously. Let κ(x) := i for x ∈ Ii and i ∈ {0, . . . , ℓ − 1}. Further, the
by extending (τ|I ◦
n-th monotonicity interval of x is deﬁned by

i

In(x) := Iκ(x) ∩ τ −1Iκ(τ x) ∩ · · · ∩ τ −(n−1)Iκ(τ n−1x).

In addition, let [x]n := (κ(x), κ(τ x), . . . , κ(τ n−1x)) for x ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N. Given any function
φ : [0, 1] → R we simply write

φn(x) =

n−1

Xk=0

φ(τ kx)

and φn(x) =

φ(τ kx)

n−1

Yk=0

for x ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N. Moreover, let Pτ ([0, 1]) denote the set of all τ -invariant Borel measures
on [0, 1]. In addition, let P([0, 1] × R) denote the set of all Borel measures on [0, 1] × R.

Gibbs measure

In this note, Gibbs measures are always supposed to have piecewise H¨older continuous potentials,
that is, ν ∈ Pτ ([0, 1]) is a Gibbs measure if for some constant Cφ > 0 and a piecewise H¨older
continuous function φ : [0, 1] → R we have that

C−1

φ 6

ν(In(x))

eφn(x)−P (φ)

6 Cφ

holds for all x ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N, where P (φ) denotes the topological pressure on ([0, 1], τ ) with
respect to the potential φ. Recall the variational principle

P (φ) =

sup

ν∈Pτ ([0,1])

hτ (ν) +Z φ dν,

where hτ (ν) denotes the K-S-entropy. Furthermore, the unique maximising measure of this vari-
ational expression is the above Gibbs measure, and vice versa. In addition, any Gibbs measure is
ergodic and atom-free. See [Kel98] for the details.

Lifted measure

For each ν ∈ Pτ ([0, 1]), we deﬁne its lift as

µϑ := ν {x ∈ [0, 1] : (x, Wϑ(x)) ∈ · } .

Hausdorﬀ dimension of measures

We follow the standard deﬁnitions of several dimensions in [Bar08].
In particular, recall some
facts. Let µ be a Borel measure on a metric space (E, d). The lower pointwise dimension of µ is
deﬁned as

dµ(u) := lim inf
r→0

log ν(Br(u))

log r

for each u ∈ E, where Br(u) := {u′ ∈ E : d(u, u′) 6 r}. In addition, the Housdorﬀ dimension of
the measure µ, denoted by dimH µ, is deﬁned as

dimH µ = inf{dimH Z : Z ⊆ E s.t. µ∗(E \ Z) = 0},

where µ∗ is the outer measure extension of µ. Alternatively, we can consider the following the
deﬁnition.

Lemma 1 ([Bar08, Theorem 2.1.5 (3)]). Let ν be a Borel measure on an Euclidean space E. Then
dimH µ is the essential minimum of dµ.

Local H¨older exponent

The local H¨older exponent of a continuous function φ : [0, 1] → R at x ∈ [0, 1] is deﬁned by

holφ(x) := sup(α ∈ (0, 1] : inf

r>0

sup

u∈Br (x)

|φ(x) − φ(u)|

|x − u|α < ∞) .

Note that the deﬁnition includes the case holφ(x) := −∞ for those x ∈ [0, 1] at which φ is not
continuous. In this note, we study the two types of level set

Eϑ,α := {x ∈ [0, 1] : holWϑ (x) = α}

and

˜Eϑ,α := {(x, Wϑ(x)) ∈ [0, 1] × R : holWϑ (x) = α} ,

in terms of the Hausdorﬀ spectrum. For simplicity, let Eα := E0,α and ˜Eα := ˜E0,α for 0 =
(0, 0, . . .).

Notation from the thermodynamic formalisms

For each q ∈ R, let Aq ∈ R be the number that is uniquely determined by

P (−Aq log τ ′ + q log λ) = 0.

(1)

Moreover,

• let αq = −A′
q,

• let D be the Legendre transform of q 7→ Aq, i.e. D(α) = supq∈R qα + Aq, and

• let

αmin = min

ν∈Pτ ([0,1])

− log λ dν
log τ ′ dν

and αmax = max

ν∈Pτ ([0,1])

− log λ dν
log τ ′ dν

.

Recall that, if αmin < αmax, the restriction of D on the interval (αmin, αmax) is a non-negative,
smooth, and strictly concave function which possesses a unique maximum point αc ∈ (αmin, αmax)
such that

D(αc) = 1 and D′(αc) = 0.

Otherwise, we deﬁne αc := αmin = αmax. In this case, we also deﬁne D(αc) := 1 and D(α) := 0
for α 6= αc.

3 Results

3.1 Results on lifted measure

Following the notation of [MW12], we say that a function g : [0, 1] → R satisﬁes the critical point
hypothesis if g is C∞([0, 1]) and there is some number r0 ∈ N such that any order of critical points
of functions of the form g(a + ·) − cg, where a ∈ (0, 1) and c ∈ R, are strictly less than r0. For
example, any non-vanishing trigonometric polynomial satisﬁes this condition.

Theorem 1. Suppose that ν ∈ Pτ (T) is a Gibbs measure. If g satisﬁes the critical point hypothesis,
then almost surely we have

dimH µϑ = min(cid:26)dimH ν + 1 + R log λ dν
R log τ ′ dν

,

hτ (ν)

R log τ ′ dν(cid:27) .

3

Remark 2. In the proof of [MW12, Proposition 2.3], in order to establish a lower bound of
dimH (graphWϑ), the authors actually proved the following: The Housdorﬀ dimension of the lift
of a Gibbs measure νφ for a potential φ is almost surely bounded from below by s chosen by

P ((s − 1) log τ ′ + (φ − P (φ)) − log λ) = 0.

This yields the sharp lower bound of the dimension of the lifted measure for φ = (1−s) log τ ′+log λ,
however, does quite rarely for any other φ, see [Jin11, Remark 5]. On the other hand, Theorem 1
provides the exact value of the dimension.

Remark 3. (Informal remark) One technical problem related to the above remark is that the
correlation dimension of ν (the critical value of the potential-theoretic method) is usually strictly
smaller than dimH ν, if we use the Euclidean metric. On the other hand, if we use a cylinder metric
dC (x, v) := 2− min{n:v6∈In(x)}, these two dimensions are the same (at least for Gibbs measure). The
main idea in the proof is to restrict our measure on a large Cantor-like set, on which these two
metrics are equivalent.

3.2 Results on local H¨older spectrum

We can apply Theorem 1 to determine the H¨older spectrum of Wϑ in the randomised case. Before
it, we present one fairly general deterministic result.

Theorem 2. Suppose that W is not diﬀerentiable. In case αmin = αmax, we have that [0, 1] \ Eαc
is a countable set and that Eα = ∅ for any α 6= αc. Clearly, dimH Eαc = D(αc) = 1.

In case αmin < αmax, we have

dimH Eα = D(α)

for α ∈ (αmin, αmax). In addition, there is a Gibbs measure να such that να(Eα) = 1 and

dimH να = D(α) =

and α =

hτ (να)

R log τ ′ dνα

−R log λ dνα
R log τ ′ dνα

.

Remark 4. The ﬁrst case in the theorem happens e.g. if we choose λ = (τ ′)−θ for some constant
θ ∈ (0, 1). Clearly, then αc = θ. In particular, Theorem 2 implies [Tod15, Theorem 1], i.e. that
the Lebesgue measure of Eθ is one. In addition, it is also possible that W is diﬀerentiable (e.g.
for a trivial choice g := 0). In this case, the spectrum is trivial, i.e. hol(x) = 1 for all x ∈ [0, 1].

Remark 5. In general, Eα = ∅ for α ∈ R \ [αmin, αmax]. However, nothing is known for α ∈
{αmin, αmax} in case αmin < αmax.

If αmin < αmax, we deﬁne a function

˜D(α) := min(cid:26)D(α) + 1 − α,

D(α)

α (cid:27)

for α ∈ (αmin, αmax). Observe that this function is strictly concave and possesses the unique
maximum point ˜αc ∈ (αmin, αmax). In view of ˜D′(˜αc) = D′(˜αc) − 1 = 0, we have ˜αc < αc.

In addition, if αmin = αmax, we deﬁne ˜αc := αc = αmin = αmax. Further, let ˜D(˜αc) :=

min{2 − ˜αc, 1/ ˜αc} and ˜D(α) := 0 for α 6= ˜αc.

Remark 6. The result in [Bed89a] actually1 yields that

dimB(graphW ) = dimP (graphW ) = ˜D(˜αc)

in both cases αmin = αmax and αmin < αmax.

1It may not be so obvious to see this statement.

4

The next result on the upper bound follows from Theorem 2 in view of [Jin11, Theorem 1],

immediately.

Theorem 3. We have

for all α ∈ (αmin, αmax).

dimH ˜Eα 6 ˜D(α)

We expect that the equality in the above theorem should be true in many cases.

Remark 7. Note that a deterministic example with Takagi function for which dimH ˜Eα = ˜D(α)
holds for all α in a large neighbourhood of ˜αc can be constructed.

Now, the next result on the randomised case is an application of Theorem 1.

Theorem 4. Suppose that g satisﬁes the critical point hypothesis. In case αmin = αmax, we have
almost surely that ([0, 1] × R) \ ˆE ˜αc is a countable set and that ˜Eα = ∅ for any α 6= ˜αc. Moreover,
we have almost surely

dimH ˜Eϑ, ˜α = ˜D(˜αc).

In case αmin < αmax, we have almost surely that

dimH ˜Eϑ,α = ˜D(α)

holds for α ∈ (αmin, αmax).

Remark 8. In fact, the critical point hypothesis suggests the nowhere diﬀerentiability of Wϑ,
almost surely.

4 Proof of Theorem 1

4.1 Fundamental properties of Gibbs measures

In the proofs of the theorems, we make use of basic properties of Gibbs measures.

Lemma 9. There is a constant D > 0 such that

(τ n)′(x)
(τ n)′(v)

∈ [D−1, D]

(τ n)′(x) · |In(u)| ∈ [D−1, D]

and

(v)

ρ′
[x]n
|In(x)|

∈ [D−1, D]

holds for all u ∈ In(x), x, v ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N.

Proof. Recall that τ ′ is piecewise ε-H¨older continuous so that log τ ′ is also. The ﬁrst one is
classical, i.e. it follows as

(τ n)′(x)
(τ n)′(v)

= ePn−1

j=0 (log τ ′(τ j x)−log τ ′(τ j u)) 6 eC0 Pn−1

j=0 |In−j(τ j x)|ε

6 eC0/(1−k1/τ ′kε

∞),

where C0 is the ε-H¨older constant of log τ ′. Note that we used also the fact |In(x)| 6 k1/τ ′kn
∞
for x ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N, which follows by the mean value theorem. The second one is due to the
mean value theorem and the last one is only a rewriting of the second one.

Lemma 10. Let ν ∈ Pτ ([0, 1]) be a Gibbs measure. Suppose that x ∈ [0, 1] is eventually periodic,
there are M, p ∈ N such that τ M+px = τ M x. Then, limN→∞ ν(IN (x)) = 0 converges
i.e.
exponentially fast.

5

Proof. Let Cφ are φ be in the deﬁnition of Gibbs measure. Let x ∈ [0, 1] and M, p ∈ N such that
τ M+px = τ M x. In view of φpk(τ M x) = kφp(τ M x), the Gibbs property asserts that

C−1

φ 6

ν(IM+pk(x))

eφM −1(x)−(M−1)Pφek(φp(τ M x)−pPφ)

6 Cφ

holds for all k ∈ N. This, in turn, implies that φp(τ M x) − pPφ < 0 since ν is non-atomic. Thus,
limk→∞ ν(IM+pk(x)) = 0 converges exponentially fast. This ﬁnishes the proof in view of the
monotonicity of N 7→ ν(IN (x)).

Given an interval I, let |I| and ∂I denote its length and the set of its endpoints, respectively.
That is, |I| := b − a and ∂I := {a, b}, where I =: [a, b]. Recall that the distance between a set and
a point is deﬁned as dist(A, x) := inf{|x − v| : v ∈ A} for A ⊆ [0, 1] and x ∈ [0, 1].

Lemma 11. Let ν ∈ Pτ ([0, 1]) be a Gibbs measure. Then we have

lim
n→∞

log dist(∂In(x), x)

log |In(x)|

= 1

for ν-a.a. x ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. In view of dist(∂In(x), x) 6 |In(x)|, we only need to show that the limit superior of the
left hand side is bounded by 1 from above.

Let α ∈ (0, 1) be arbitrary. Then, let Mn := ⌊αn⌋. Furthermore, let

En := τ n−Mn (IMn (0) ∪ IMn (1))

for n ∈ N. Observe that for x ∈ [0, 1] \ En we have

Since by Lemma 9

dist(∂In(x), x) > min(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:12)ρ[x]n−Mn (IMn (0))(cid:12)(cid:12) ,(cid:12)(cid:12)ρ[x]n−Mn (IMn (1))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:9) .

(cid:12)(cid:12)ρ[x]n−Mn (IMn (i))(cid:12)(cid:12) > (min ρ′

) |IMn (i)|
> D−1 |In−Mn (x)| |IMn (i)|
> D−2 |In−Mn (x)| (min(1/τ ′))Mn

[x]n−Mn

for i ∈ {0, 1}, we have

dist(∂In(x), x) > D−2 |In−Mn (x)| (min(1/τ ′))Mn .

Thus, in view of Birkhoﬀ’s ergodic theorem and Lemma 9, we have

lim sup

for ν-a.a. x ∈ [0, 1] \TN ∈NSn>N En. On the other hand, by Borel–Cantelli lemma we have
ν(cid:16)TN ∈NSn>N En(cid:17) = 0 since

ν(En) = (IMn (0) ∪ IMn (1)) 6 ν(IMn (0)) + ν(IMn (1))

is summable by Lemma 10. Therefore, (2) holds ν-a.a. x ∈ [0, 1]. Finally, letting α ց 0 ﬁnishes
the proof.

Lemma 12. If ν is a Gibbs measure for φ, then

dimH ν =

hτ (ν)

− log τ ′ dν

.

Proof. Let Br(x) := {x′ ∈ [0, 1] : |x − x′| 6 r} be balls for x ∈ [0, 1] and r > 0. Observe that, by
Lemmas 9 and 11,

Bdist(∂In(x),x)(x) ⊆ In(x) ⊆ B|In(x)|(x)

and

lim
n→∞

log |In(x)|
log |In+1(x)|

= 1

hold for all x ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N, we have

dν (x) = lim inf
n→∞

log ν(In(x))
log |In(x)|

for ν-a.a. x ∈ [0, 1]. Thus, the claim follows from this in view of Shannon–McMillan–Breiman
theorem and Birkhoﬀ’s ergodic theorem together with Lemma 9.

4.2 Upper bound

Lemma 13. Let ν ∈ Pτ ([0, 1]) be a Gibbs measure. Then we have

dimH µϑ 6 min(cid:26)dimH ν + 1 + R log λ dν
R log τ ′ dν

,

hτ (ν)

R log τ ′ dν(cid:27)

for all ϑ ∈ [0, 1]N0 .

Proof. Let ϑ ∈ [0, 1]N0 be given. As we will check in Lemma 25 later, the inequality of [MW12,
Proposition 3.1] is valid in our slight diﬀerent setting, i.e. there is a constant ¯C > 0 such that

sup

|Wϑ(x) − Wϑ(v)| 6 ¯C λn(x)

(3)

holds for all x ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N. Let ε ∈ (0, e− R log τ ′ dν) be chosen arbitrarily. Let DN ⊆ [0, 1]
denote the set of those x ∈ [0, 1] which satisfy: For all n > N hold all of

By Birkhoﬀ’s ergodic theorem, Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem and Lemma 9, we have

−R log λ dν(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ε,
− hτ (ν)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ε and
−R log τ ′ dν(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ε.

• (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
• (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
ν (SN DN ) = 1. Now, we consider the lifted set GN := {(x, Wϑ(x)) : x ∈ DN }. For each n > N
|In(x)|m cubes with

let U N
the cardinality of U N
In(x) ∈ U N
edge length |In(x)|. Moreover, for x ∈ DN and n > N , this number is bounded as

n := {In(x) : x ∈ DN }. Since we have exp (n (−hτ (ν) − ε)) < ν(In(x)) for each In(x) ∈ U N
n ,
n does not exceed exp (n (hτ (ν) + ε)). Furthermore, in view of (3), for each

n we can construct a covering of GN ∩ (In(x) × R) by at most lC λn(x)
|In(x)|(cid:25) 6 C exp(cid:18)n(cid:18)Z log τ ′ dν +Z log λ dν + 2ε(cid:19)(cid:19) + 1.

As µϑ (SN GN ) = 1, we have dimH (µϑ) 6 dimH (SN GN ) by deﬁnition. Thus,

Now, we consider a very rough estimate as follows. Observe that for any β ∈ (0, 1) and C > 0

we have

log ν {v ∈ [0, 1] : |x − v| 6 βn, |Wϑ(x) − Wϑ(v)| 6 C βn}

log βn

holds for ν-almost all x, which immediately follows from [Bar08, Proposition 2.1.4]. Given an
arbitrary ε ∈ (0, eR log λ dν), let DN ⊆ [0, 1], N ∈ N be the same as above. This time, we only use
the ﬁrst, third and last property of the deﬁnition of DN , or more precisely, the fact that

In(x) ⊆nv ∈ [0, 1] : |v − x| 6 (eε˜λ)n, |Wϑ(v) − Wϑ(x)| 6 C (eε˜λ)no

holds for all x ∈ DN , n > N , where ˜λ := eR log λ dν. By choosing β = eε˜λ and C = C in the above
equality, we have

dµϑ (x, Wϑ(x)) = lim inf

4.3 Lower bound

We assume that ν ∈ Pτ ([0, 1]) is a Gibbs measure. Moreover, we assume that g satisﬁes the critical
point hypothesis. In addition, let d denote the Euclidean metric on [0, 1], i.e. d(x, v) := |x − v| for
x, v ∈ [0, 1]. As τ has full branches and τ ′ > 0, there is a small number δ0 > 0 such that for any
x, v ∈ [0, 1]

max{d(x, v), d(τ x, τ v)} 6 δ0

implies

v ∈ I1(x).

Clearly, δ0 is an expansivity constant for τ . Given n ∈ N, let dn(x, v) := max{d(τ j x, τ j v) : j =
0, . . . , n − 1} denote the n-the Bowen metric for x, v ∈ [0, 1]. In addition, let Bn,r(x) := {u ∈
[0, 1] : dn(x, u) 6 r} denote the ball with respect to dn with centre x ∈ [0, 1] and radius r > 0.

For ε ∈ (0, 1), let Cε ⊆ [0, 1] be the set of those x for which hold

• Be−n(R log τ ′ dν+ε)(x) ⊆ Bn,δ0 (x) ⊆ Be−n(R log τ ′ dν−ε)(x),

• en(R log λ dν−ε) 6 λn(x) 6 en(R log λ dν+ε), and

• rdimH (ν)+ε 6 ν(Br(x)) 6 rdimH (ν)−ε

for all n ∈ N and r > 0.

Lemma 14. We have limε→0 ν(Cε) = 1.

Proof. Let ε > 0 be arbitrary. Further, let x ∈ [0, 1] and n > 2. Firstly, if v ∈ [0, 1] satisﬁes
dn(x, v) 6 δ0, then v ∈ In−2(x) due to the choice of δ0. Thus we have d(x, v) 6 |In−2(x)| 6
D/(τ n−2)′(x) by Lemma 9. In consequence, we have

Bn,δ0 (x) ⊆ BRn(x)(x), where Rn(x) :=

D

(τ n−2)′(x)

.

Next, suppose that v ∈ [0, 1] satisﬁes dn(x, v) > δ0, i.e. that there is some 0 6 j 6 n − 1 such
that d(τ j x, τ j v) > δ0. Here, we distinguish two cases.
If v 6∈ In(x), then we have d(x, v) >
dist(∂In(x), x). And, otherwise we have

(τ n)′(˜v) · d(x, v) > (τ j )′(˜v) · d(x, v) = d(τ j x, τ j v) > δ

for some ˜v ∈ In(x), so that follows d(x, v) > D−1δ/(τ n)′(x). In consequence, we have

Brn(x)(x) ⊆ Bn,δ0 (x), where

rn(x) := min(cid:26)dist(∂In(x), x),

D−1δ0

(τ n)′(x)(cid:27) .

Now, let C ⊆ [0, 1] be the set of those x for which hold

Observe that ν(C) = 1. Indeed, the ﬁrst condition follows from Birkhoﬀ’s theorem together with
Lemmas 9 and 11, while the second and the last one are due to Birkhoﬀ’s theorem and Lemma

12, respectively. In view of C ⊆Sε>0 Cε, the proof is ﬁnished.

We consider the restriction νε := ν(Cε ∩ · ) and its lift

Recall that s-energy of a Borel measure µ on a metric space (E, dE ) is deﬁned by

µϑ,ε := ν {x ∈ [0, 1] : (x, Wϑ(x)) ∈ · } .

Is(µ) =ZZ dµ(x)dµ(v)
dE (x, v)s .

9

Furthermore, Is(µ) < ∞ implies that dµ > s holds µ-almost surely (see e.g. [Fal05, Section 4.3]).

Observe that

where ∆δ0 := {(x, v) ∈ [0, 1]2 : d(x, v) 6 δ0} is the δ0-diagonal set.

Lemma 15. If Eε,s < ∞ for some s > 0, then we have almost surely that

holds for ν-a.a. x ∈ Cε.

dµϑ (x, Wϑ(x)) > s

Proof. If Eε,s < ∞, we have Is(µϑ,ε) < ∞ by (4) for almost all ϑ. In the following, let ϑ be
such a parameter. Now, the bounded s-energy implies that dµϑ,ε(x, y) > s holds for µϑ,ε-almost
all (x, y) ∈ [0, 1] × R. This means by deﬁnition that dµϑ,ε(x, Wϑ(x)) > s holds for ν-almost all
x ∈ Cε. On the other hand, by Borel density theorem we have

lim
r→0

µϑ,ε(Br(x, y))
µϑ(Br(x, y))

= lim
r→0

µϑ(Br(x, y) ∩ (Cε × R))

µϑ(Br(x, y))

= 1

for µϑ-almost all (x, y) ∈ Cε ×R. Thus, we have dµϑ (x, Wϑ(x)) = dµϑ,ε(x, Wϑ(x)) > s for ν-almost
all x ∈ Cε.

Given x, v ∈ [0, 1], let hx,v be the density function of the random variable ϑ 7→ Wϑ(x) − Wϑ(v)
with respect to the Lebesgue measure on R. The next key lemma is due to [MW12], which in
particular says that the densities exist.

Lemma 16 (Key lemma). There is a constant Ch > 0 such that

khx,vk∞ 6

Ch

λn(x)

for all v 6∈ Bn,δ0 (x) \ Bn+1,δ0 (x), n ∈ N and x ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. This is a special case of [MW12, Lemma 4.2], whose proof can almost literally translated
to this case. Some remarks:

• The points z, x, y in their proof correspond to x, x, v in our notation.

• The restriction to Bn,2δ0(z) × Bn,2δ0(z) in the deﬁnition of X r

n(z) in their proof was not used

for this part, i.e. X r

n(z) corresponds to our Bn,δ0 (x) \ Bn+1,δ0 (x).

• We allow here possible non-diﬀerentiability of τ and λ at the end points of Markov partition.

This does not matter, while g ∈ C∞(R/Z) is a crucial assumption here.

Let us ﬁrst consider the Housdorﬀ spectra of the (sub-, sup-) level sets:

Sα :=(cid:26)x ∈ [0, 1] : lim inf

n→∞

− log λn(x)
log(τ ′)n(x)

Recall the following well-known fact.

Lemma 19. If αmin < αmax, we have

D(α) = dimH Sα =(dimH S6

α
dimH S>
α

if α ∈ (αmin, αc]
if α ∈ [αc, αmax)

for α ∈ (αmin, αmax). Furthermore, there exists a Gibbs measure να ∈ Pτ ([0, 1]) which is exact
dimensional such that να(Sα) = 1 and

Therefore, it suﬃces to show that the symmetric diﬀerence

dimH να = dimH Sα.

Eα △ Sα

is a countable set for any α ∈ R, unless W is diﬀerentiable. Note that according to [Bed89a], W is
either diﬀerentiable or ’strictly’ H¨older continuous. As the spectrum of the local H¨older exponent
is trivial in the diﬀerentiable case, we only need to consider the other case.

The remainder of the proof is thus only based on the following elementary observations. The
next lemma give a general formula for the local H¨older exponent that is true for any function on
[0, 1].2

Lemma 20. For any function W : [0, 1] → R, we have

hol(x) = lim
rց0

u∈Br (x)

log |W (x) − W (u)|

log r

for all x ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. Let x ∈ [0, 1] be ﬁxed and let ˜h denote the value on the right hand side (for this x).

Now, let ε > 0 be arbitrary. Then there is a sequence (ri)i∈N ⊂ (0, 1) such that

From this follows

|x − u|˜h+ε

This implies that hol(x) 6 ˜h + 2ε. Letting ε → 0 yields hol(x) 6 ˜h.

To prove the reverse inequality, we may assume ˜h > 0. Let ε ∈ (0, ˜h) be arbitrary. Then there

is some r0 > 0 such that

inf

u∈Br (x)

log |W (x) − W (u)|

or equivalently,

The next non-trivial expression of hol(x) is essential in this proof. However, this is also a very

(κ(τ N x), κ(τ N +1x)) ∈ {(0, 0), (ℓ − 1, ℓ − 1)}. Further, let

G := \˜N∈N [N > ˜N

|IN (x)| > r} so that r < Nr(x) 6 br. Observe

3We can choose e.g. δ = min{|I0|2, |Iℓ−1|2} in case that τ is linear, and otherwise the bounded distortion of τ ′

should be considered.

14

Finally, we show that G = [0, 1] \Sn∈N τ −n{0, 1}. Let x ∈ [0, 1] \ G. Then there is a ˜N ∈ N

such that

dist(∂(IN (x)), {x}) < δ|IN (x)|

holds for all N > ˜N . Due to the choice of δ > 0 we have (κ(τ N x), κ(τ N +1x)) ∈ {(0, 0), (ℓ−1, ℓ−1)}
for all N > ˜N . This is only possible when

˜N x), κ(τ

˜N +1x), κ(τ

(cid:16)κ(τ

˜N +2x), . . .(cid:17) ∈ {(0, 0, . . .), (ℓ − 1, ℓ − 1, . . .)},

i.e. when τ ˜N x ∈ {0, 1}. Thus [0, 1] \ G =Sn>0 τ −n{0, 1}.

According to [Bed89a], the Weierstrass-type function W is either C1+ε or nowhere diﬀeren-
tiable, depending on the choice of τ, λ and g. We say in the ﬁst case that W is degenerate. Clearly,
we have hol(x) = 1 for all x ∈ [0, 1] in the the degenerate case and there is nothing more to discuss.
The next key lemma is [Bed89a, Proposition 8].

Lemma 22. If W is not degenerate, there is a constant C > 0 such that

sup

|W (v) − W (x)| ∈ [C−1, C] · λN (x).

v∈IN (x)

Now we obtain the crucial expression of hol(x).

Lemma 23. If W is not degenerate, we have

In particular, Eα △ Sα is a countable set for all α ∈ R.

6 Proof of Theorem 4

In view of Theorem 3, we only need to show the lower bound by virtue of Theorems 1 and 2.
Theorem 3 is rather an immediate consequence of the others except for a subtle technical issue
that Lemma 22 does not apply for all ϑ, uniformly. Thus, we ﬁrst state the concluding part of this
theorem as the next lemma, assuming an essential topological assumption which we shall prove
later.

Lemma 24. Suppose that, for any α ∈ (αmin, αmax), the symmetric diﬀerence

Eϑ,α △ Sα

is almost surely a countable set. Then we have the lower bound, i.e. we have almost surely that

˜D(α) 6 dimH ˜Eϑ,α

holds for all α ∈ (αmin, αmax).
ϑ,α and ˜S>

Proof. Let ˜Sϑ,α, ˜S6
ϑ,α on the graph of Wϑ,
respectively. By Lemmas 19 there is a Gibbs measure να such that να(Sα) = 1. Thus, if µϑ,α
denotes the lift of να on the graph of Wϑ, we have almost surely µϑ,α( ˜Sϑ,α) = 1. Therefore, by
Theorems 1 and 2 we have almost surely

ϑ,α denote the lifts of Sϑ,α, S6

Together with the assumption of the lemma, we have

dimH ˜Eϑ,α = dimH ˜Sϑ,α > ˜D(α)

for all α ∈ (αmin, αmax) ∩ Q and ϑ ∈ Z, where Z ⊆ [0, 1]N0 is a subset of full probability measure.
Now, let α ∈ (αmin, αc]. For any sequence (αn)n∈N ⊂ Q such that αn ր α, we have by Lemma

19

dimH ˜Eϑ,α = dimH ˜Sϑ,α = dimH ˜S6

ϑ,α > dimH S6

αn = ˜D(αn)

n→∞−→ ˜D(α)

for all ϑ ∈ Z. Thus, dimH ˜Eϑ,α > ˜D(α) for all α ∈ (αmin, αc] and ϑ ∈ Z. Similarly, the same
result can be also veriﬁed for α ∈ [αc, αmax) by considering sequences αn ց α. Thus, the proof is
ﬁnished.

In the following, we will verify the assumption of the preceding lemma. The next lemma is
a weaker alternative to Lemma 22, that is suﬃcient for our purpose. Let σ : [0, 1]N0 → [0, 1]N0
denote the left shift operator.

Lemma 25. There is a constant ¯C > 0 such that the upper bound

sup

|Wϑ(x) − Wϑ(v)| 6 ¯C λn(x)

v∈In(x)

holds for all x ∈ [0, 1], n ∈ N and ϑ ∈ [0, 1]N0.

Furthermore, if dimH µϑ > dimH ν a.s., then we have also the lower bound

sup

|Wϑ(x) − Wϑ(v)| > Cσnϑ λn(x)

v∈In(x)

for all x ∈ [0, 1], n ∈ N and ϑ ∈ [0, 1]N0 , where ϑ 7→ Cϑ is a measurable function such that

Observe that the proof of Theorem 4 follows immediately form Lemma 25, together with

Lemma 21.

In the following, we shall prove Lemma 25. The idea is to apply an ergodic theorem to the
dynamics ([0, 1]N0, σ, mN0 ), where mN0 is the inﬁnite product of the Lebesgue measure m on [0, 1].
Let ρi : [0, 1] → I i denote the continuous extension of the inverse branch (τ |Ii )−1 for each i ∈
{0, . . . , ℓ − 1}. In addition, let [ϑ]n := (ϑ0, ϑ1, . . . , ϑn−1) and [x]n := (κ(x), κ(τ x), . . . , κ(τ n−1x))
for x ∈ [0, 1] and ϑ ∈ [0, 1]N0 and n ∈ N, where κ(x) := i for x ∈ Ii and i ∈ {0, . . . , ℓ − 1}. For
each (ϑ, i) ∈ [0, 1] × {0, . . . , ℓ − 1}, we deﬁne the contracting map Fϑ,i : [0, 1] × R → [0, 1] × R by

Fϑ,i(x, y) = (ρi(x), λ(ρi(x)) y + g(ρi(x) + ϑ)) .

Observe that

for all x ∈ [0, 1] and ϑ ∈ [0, 1]N0. Moreover, the derivative matrix of Fϑ,i is given by

Fϑ0,κ(x)(τ x, Wσϑ(τ x)) = (x, Wϑ(x))

[Bed89a], for a curve C : I → I × R, let |C|W and |C|H denote the width and height of the image
C(I), respectively.

Lemma 26 ([Bed89a, Lemma 6]). Let I be an interval and M > 0. For any curve C : I →
[0, 1] × [−M, M ], we have

|Fϑ,i ◦ C|H > |C|H inf
t∈I

ci(C1(t)) − b · |C|W ,

Proof. In view of an approximation, we may assume that C is diﬀerentiable. Then, we have

where C(t) = (C1(t), C2(t)) and b := max(cid:26)bi(ϑ, x, y) :
2(t)(cid:21) =(cid:20)

(Fϑ,i ◦ C)′(t) = DFϑ,i(C(t)) ·(cid:20)C′

Therefore, we have

for any t1, t2 ∈ I such that t1 6 t2. Thus the claim is proved.

The next lemma is essentially the same as [Bed89a, Proposition 7]. However, we need to check

that the additional variable ϑ here does not aﬀect in the estimate, badly.

Lemma 27. Let M > 0. There are constants L′, L′′, L′′′ > 0 such that

(L′ |C|H − L′′ |C|W ) λn(ρi(x)) 6 |F n

ϑ,i ◦ C|H 6 L′′′λn(ρi(x))

for any curve C : I → [0, 1] × [−M, M ], (ϑ, i) ∈ [0, 1]n × {0, . . . , ℓ − 1}n, x ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N.

Proof. By applying Lemma 26, inductively, we obtain

to obtain the constant D1 = | log(1/τ ′)|ε/(1 − (inf 1/τ ′)ε) if the derivative of log(1/τ ′) does not

in place of Lemma 26. Note that the proof of [MW12, Proposition 3.1] also applies directly.

Now, we can conclude the proof of the main lemma of this section.

Lemma 28. Assume that dimH µϑ > dimH ν, almost surely. Given a constant L > 0, we deﬁne

˜Cϑ := sup

u,v∈[0,1]

|Wϑ(u) − Wϑ(v)| − L · |u − v|

for ϑ ∈ [0, 1]N0 . If L is suﬃciently large, then we have limn→∞

log ˜Cσnϑ

n

= 0, almost surely.

Proof. Observe that dimH µϑ > dimH ν implies that Wϑ is nowhere diﬀerentiable. As we assumed
the former condition almost surely, we have Cϑ > 0 almost surely.

Let ˜λ := inf λ and M := supϑ,u |Wϑ(u)|. For u, v ∈ [0, 1] and i ∈ {0, . . . , ℓ − 1} let w ∈ [u, v]

such that |ρi(u) − ρi(v)| = ρ′

i(w) |u − v|. By (6) we have

Wϑ(ρi(u)) = λ(ρi(u)) Wσϑ(u) + g(ρi(u) + ϑ0).

Observe that

|λ(ρi(u)) Wσϑ(v) − λ(ρi(v)) Wσϑ(v)|

> λ(ρi(w)) |Wσϑ(x) − Wσϑ(v)| − M · (|λ(ρi(u)) − λ(ρi(w))| + |λ(ρi(w)) − λ(ρi(v))|)
> λ(ρi(w)) |Wσϑ(u) − Wσϑ(v)| − 2M kλ′k∞ |u − v|,

that

and that

−|g(ρi(u) + ϑ1) − g(ρi(v) + ϑ1)| > −kg′k∞ |u − v|,

i(w) = λ(ρi(w))(cid:18)1 −

inf(λτ ′)(cid:19) =: δ0 > 0.

Thus, we have

|Wϑ(ρi(u)) − Wϑ(ρi(v))| − L |ρi(u) − ρi(v)|

> λ(ρi(w)) (|Wσϑ(u) − Wσϑ(v)| − L |u − v|)

+(L λ(ρi(w)) − L ρ′

i(w) − 2M kλk∞ − kg′k∞) |u − v|

> ˜λ (|Wσϑ(u) − Wσϑ(v)| − L |u − v|) + (L δ0 − 2M kλ′k∞ − kg′k∞) |u − v|
> ˜λ (|Wσϑ(u) − Wσϑ(v)| − L |u − v|) ,

if we choose L > (2M kλ′k∞ + kg′k∞)δ−1

0 . Therefore,

˜λ ˜Cσϑ 6

inf

i∈{0,...,ℓ−1}

sup
u,v∈Ii

|Wϑ(u) − Wϑ(v)| − L |u − v| 6 ˜Cϑ,

and thus log ˜Cϑ − log ˜Cσϑ > log ˜λ. Since R (log ˜Cϑ − log ˜Cσϑ) dmN0 (ϑ) by [Kel96, Lemma 2], we

have by Birkhoﬀ’s ergodic theorem that

Xk=1

(log ˜Cσk ϑ − log ˜Cσk−1 ϑ) = 0

for almost all ϑ.

Proof of Lemma 25. Observe that Theorem 1 implies that dimH µϑ > dimH ν almost surely. Let
L′, L′′ and L′′′ be the constants of Lemma 27. Furthermore, let ˜Cϑ be the function of Lemma 27
which is deﬁned for a suﬃciently large constant L > L′′/L′.

Let x ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N be ﬁxed. Then, let C(t) := (t, Wσn ϑ(t)) be a curve deﬁned on

I := [0, 1]. By (7), we have

(s, Wϑ(s)) = F n

[ϑ]n,[x]n (C(τ ns))

(8)

for all s ∈ In(x). Thus, by Lemma 27 we have

sup

|Wϑ(x) − Wϑ(v)| 6

sup

|Wϑ(u) − Wϑ(v)|

v∈In(x)

u,v∈In(x)

[ϑ]n,[x]n ◦ C(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)H

6 2L′′′ λn(τ nx) = 2L′′′ λn(x).

Therefore, we can choose C := 2L′′′ for the upper bound.

Now we claim that Cϑ := (L′/2) ˜Cϑ satisﬁes the claim for the upper bound. As it is evident
= 0 a.s., we only need to check the claimed inequality. Let t1, t2 ∈ I be such

log Cσn ϑ

that limn→∞
that

n

˜Cσn ϑ = |Wσn ϑ(t1) − Wσn ϑ(t2)| − L · |t1 − t2|.

W.l.o.g. we assume that t1 < t2. Let ˆC be the restriction of C on the interval [t1, t2], which is
again a curve. By Lemma 27 and (8), we have

Cσn ϑ λn(x) = (L′/2) (|Wσn ϑ(t1) − Wσn ϑ(t2)| − L · |t1 − t2|) λn(x)
6 2−1 (L′|Wσn ϑ(t1) − Wσn ϑ(t2)| − L′′ · |t1 − t2|) λn(x)
