ABSTRACT

Context. Polarimetric observations of Bok globules frequently show a decrease in the degree of polarization towards their central dense
regions (polarization holes). This behaviour is usually explained with increased disalignment owing to high density and temperature,
or insuﬃcient angular resolution of a possibly complex magnetic ﬁeld structure.
Aims. We investigate whether a signiﬁcant decrease in polarized emission of dense regions in Bok globules is possible under certain
physical conditions. For instance, we evaluate the impact of optical depth eﬀects and various properties of the dust phase.
Methods. We use radiative transfer modelling to calculate the temperature structure of an analytical Bok globule model and simulate
the polarized thermal emission of elongated dust grains. For the alignment of the dust grains, we consider a magnetic ﬁeld and include
radiative torque and internal alignment.
Results. Besides the usual explanations, selected conditions of the temperature and density distribution, the dust phase and the
magnetic ﬁeld are also able to signiﬁcantly decrease the polarized emission of dense regions in Bok globules. Taking submm/mm
grains and typical column densities of existing Bok globules into consideration, the optical depth is high enough to decrease the
degree of polarization by up to ∆P∼10%. If limited to the densest regions, dust grain growth to submm/mm size and accumulated
graphite grains decrease the degree of polarization by up to ∆P∼10% and ∆P∼5%, respectively. However, the eﬀect of the graphite
grains occurs only if they do not align with the magnetic ﬁeld.

1. Introduction

The evolution of a collapsing molecular cloud to an evolved star
is not yet fully understood. In particular, the impact of magnetic
ﬁelds on star formation is an important part of the ongoing dis-
cussion (Matthews & Wilson 2002; Pudritz et al. 2014; Seifried
& Walch 2015). For instance, magnetic ﬁelds are considered as
stabilising star-forming regions and ﬁlaments against contrac-
tion which is a possible explanation of observed low star forma-
tion rates, compared to the amount of gas in star-forming regions
(Van Loo et al. 2015; Federrath 2015). Magnetic ﬁelds are also
expected to inﬂuence the shape of cloud fragments and the cou-
pling between the gas and dust phase in molecular clouds (Hen-
ning et al. 2001).

In general, magnetic ﬁelds are indirectly measured by polari-
metric observations in the near-IR or submm/mm regime (see
e.g. Bertrang et al. 2014). Elongated dust grains are thought to
align with their longer axis perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld
lines, which causes polarized thermal emission and dichroic ex-
tinction of the dust phase. Various mechanisms have been pro-
posed to explain the alignment of dust grains (paramagnetic re-
laxation, Davis & Greenstein 1951; mechanical alignment, Gold
1952; radiative torque alignment, Lazarian 2007). Nevertheless,
the impact of each alignment mechanism strongly depends on
the environment that is been considered. For example, mechan-
ical alignment only appears in regions with supersonic ﬂows
(Lazarian 1995) whereby radiative torque alignment is very ef-
ﬁcient in a strong anisotropic radiation ﬁeld (Matsumura et al.
2011).

Polarimetric observations of molecular clouds sometimes
show a decrease in the degree of polarization towards dense re-
gions (polarization holes; Rao et al. 1998; Matthews 2005). The
origin of this eﬀect is not yet understood, but is usually explained
with an assumed increased disalignment of the dust grains, ow-
ing to higher density and temperature (Goodman et al. 1992;
Hildebrand et al. 1999; Henning et al. 2001; Wolf et al. 2003) or
insuﬃcient angular resolution of a possibly complex magnetic
ﬁeld structure (Glenn et al. 1999; Wolf et al. 2004; Matthews
2005). However, the relevance of these eﬀects has not been con-
ﬁrmed quantitatively.

In the optically thin case, elongated dust grains cause po-
larized emission that is due to the diﬀerent absorption cross-
sections of their axes. In the optically thick case, this diﬀerence
of the cross-sections causes dichroic extinction instead. The tran-
sition between both cases is expected to show a decreased degree
of polarization. For this reason, we investigate the inﬂuence of
the optical depth and related physical properties of the dust on
the polarized emission of Bok globules and their potential to sig-
niﬁcantly decrease the degree of polarization of dense regions.

Given a suﬃciently high angular resolution, all Bok glob-
ules have so far shown this quantitative behaviour of their ra-
dial submm polarization proﬁle (Henning et al. 2001; Wolf et al.
2003; Wolf et al. 2004). Bok globules are dense and cold molec-
ular clouds where low-mass star formation typically takes place
(Bok & Reilly 1947; Clemens et al. 1991). They often have a
simple spherical shape which supports modelling approaches.
To achieve our aims, we create a generic analytical model of
a Bok globule. We use observational constrained parameters of

the Bok globule B335 to ensure that the model is a good ap-
proximation of a real Bok globule (Wolf et al. 2003; Evans et al.
2005; Olofsson & Olofsson 2009; Bertrang et al. 2014; Laun-
hardt et al. 2010). The globule B335 is suitable because obser-
vations at λ = 850 µm show that the degree of polarization de-
creases from ∼ 15% at the envelope to ∼ 2% at the centre. Fur-
thermore, we vary selected parameters, such as dust grain size
and density distribution, to cover diﬀerent kinds of Bok globules
and investigate the impact of such parameters on the answer of
our key question.

Based on our model of a Bok globule, we perform contin-
uum radiative transfer simulations in the submm/mm regime
with the radiative transfer code POLARIS (POLArized RadI-
ation Simulator, Reissl et al. subm.) which is able to consider
magnetic ﬁelds and the dust grain alignment mechanisms men-
tioned above. From POLARIS, we obtain intensity and polar-
ization maps to investigate a potential decrease in the degree of
polarization.

We begin this study with an introduction of our reference
model that is based on the Bok globule B335, which includes
the chosen magnetic ﬁeld and the alignment mechanisms (see
Sect. 2). Subsequently, we present the results and start with an
analysis of the inﬂuence of the optical depth on the degree of
polarization in our reference model (see Sect. 3). This analysis is
followed by a general discussion of the optical depth eﬀect. After
that, we investigate under which conditions the optical depth and
other physical quantities are able to cause a signiﬁcant decrease
in the degree of polarization. Finally, we summarize the results
and give a conclusion in Sect. 4.

2. Model description

Density distribution:

The density distribution of the gas and dust phase is based on a
Bonnor-Ebert sphere with a constant central density which can
be written as follows (Kaminski et al. 2014):

 ρ0 · R−2

0 ,
ρ0 · r−2,
0,

ρ(r) =

if r ≤ R0
if R0 < r ≤ Rout
if r > Rout

(1)

Here, ρ0 is a reference density used to achieve the preset Bok
globule mass, r is the radial distance from the central stellar ob-
ject, and R0 is a truncation radius that deﬁnes the extent of the
central region with constant density.
For our reference model, we consider a truncation radius of
R0 = 103 AU and an outer radius of Rout = 1.5 · 104 AU to
ﬁt with the radial brightness proﬁle of the Bok globule B335
(see Fig. 2, left; Wolf et al. 2003). Investigations of the line-of-
sight optical depth need a model that is in agreement with col-
umn densities that are derived from existing Bok globules. Typ-
ical values of the beam-averaged hydrogen column density are
between NH,beam = 1027 m−2 and NH,beam = 1028 m−2 (Laun-
hardt et al. 2010). This corresponds to total masses between
Mgas ∼ 4 M(cid:12) and Mgas ∼ 40 M(cid:12) for our reference model which
is in agreement with other mass estimations of Bok globules
(Mgas = {2, 100} M(cid:12); Bok 1977; Leung 1985; Clemens et al.
1991). The default parameters of our reference model are sum-
marised in Table 2, but within the scope of our study, we vary
selected parameters with regard to diﬀerent kinds of Bok glob-
ules.

Dust:
We assume compact, homogeneous and oblate dust grains, con-
sisting of 62.5% silicate and 37.5% graphite (MRN-dust, Mathis
et al. 1977; optical properties from Weingartner & Draine 2001).
The ratio between the longer and shorter axis is 1 : 0.5. For the
grain size distribution we assume
dn(a) ∝ a−3.5da,
where n(a) is the number of dust particles with a speciﬁc dust
grain radius a.

amin < a < amax,

Table 1 illustrates the spectral index of selected Bok globules
that show one or more polarization holes. These as well as other
Bok globules feature a low spectral index in the submm/mm
regime of their total ﬂux. A spectral index between two and
three is usually a sign of advanced dust grain growth (Natta et al.
2007). Considering dust grain growth up to submm/mm size in
our reference model, the spectral index derived from the simu-
lated ﬂux at 850 µm and 450 µm amounts to ∼ 2.8, which is in
agreement with observations (for minimum and maximum grain
size see Table 2). This spectral index corresponds to an emissiv-
ity index β of ∼ 0.8.

Magnetic ﬁeld:
We assume a constant magnetic ﬁeld strength of B ∼ 140 µG
(B335, Wolf et al. 2004) in the whole Bok globule model. The
magnetic ﬁeld lines are oriented perpendicular with respect to
the observer (y-direction in Figs. 3 and 8). Other more complex
magnetic ﬁeld structures are also possible, but they would in-
crease exceedingly the number of free parameters.

Alignment mechanisms:
We consider the following mechanisms for aligning oblate dust
grains perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld:
– Radiative torque alignment (RAT)

For this mechanism, dust grains are considered as having a
helicity that causes them to spin up by being radiated in an
anisotropic radiation ﬁeld with wavelengths less than their
diameter (Lazarian 2007; Lazarian & Hoang 2007; Hoang
& Lazarian 2009; Andersson et al. 2015). The spinning
dust grains align through the Barnett eﬀect (Barnett 1915),
which is opposed by gas bombardment, which reduces the
alignment. We emphasise that our model uses perfect oblate
spheroids to approximate oblate spheroids with a helicity.
Usually, perfect oblate spheroids have no helicity.

– Imperfect internal alignment

In general, the largest moment of inertia is not perfectly
aligned with the angular momentum (Purcell 1979). Fluc-
tuations in the thermal energy will randomly excite rotation
around all three body axes with energies in the order of kTd
(Td : dust temperature). If the rotational energy of the grain
is (cid:29) kTd, then these thermal ﬂuctuations are negligible and
Barnett dissipation aligns the dust grains with their largest
moment of inertia to the angular momentum (Jones & Spitzer
1967; Lazarian & Roberge 1997). However, the grains in
molecular clouds are likely to have rotational energies ∼ kTd
that results in imperfect internal alignment.

We do not consider paramagnetic relaxation (Davis & Green-
stein 1951), because simulations of our reference model show
that this alignment mechanism is negligible compared to the
RAT theory. We do also not assume supersonic ﬂows and, there-
fore, we neglect mechanical alignment (Gold 1952).

Radiative transfer:

We apply the three-dimensional continuum RT code POLARIS
(POLArized RadIation Simulator, Reissl et al. subm.). This
solves the radiative transfer problem self-consistently with the
Monte Carlo method, and it considers magnetic ﬁelds as well
as various dust grain alignment mechanisms. We use it to cal-
culate the spatial temperature distribution of our Bok globule
model and derive thermal emission maps using the full Stokes
vector. The required optical properties of the dust grains are de-
rived from the complex refractive index of the given material
by using the Discrete Dipole SCATtering code (DDSCAT, see
Sect. 2; Draine & Flatau 2013). However, DDSCAT is not able
to calculate the optical properties of dust grains with a (cid:29) λ. We
compensate for this by using the MIEX scattering routine for
these dust grains (Wolf & Voshchinnikov 2004). This approx-
imation is justiﬁed, because their optical properties are almost
isotropic at this size. We simulate the thermal emission of our
reference model at λ = 850 µm, because many observations of
polarization holes have been performed at this wavelength (e.g.
with SCUBA/JCMT).

The implementation of the radiative torque alignment re-
quires us to specify the free parameter fhigh,J, which describes
the ratio between dust grains rotating with high- and low-angular
momentum. In the RAT theory, only these two rotational states
are stable (Hoang & Lazarian 2008). A grain with another angu-
lar momentum converges towards one of these stable points. The
point of low angular momentum is prone to thermal bombard-
ment of gas particles, which reduces the degree of alignment.
Dust grains at the point of high angular momentum are not ex-
pected to be inﬂuenced by thermal disalignment and, therefore,
perfectly aligned. In reality, fhigh,J depends on physical quanti-
ties such as temperature and density but cannot be calculated
analytically (Hoang & Lazarian 2014). In POLARIS, fhigh,J is
implemented by using one value for the whole model. For our
reference model, we consider fhigh,J = 0, but we also investigate
the inﬂuence of other values in this parameter (see Sect. 3).

Heating source:

The primary heating source is a central young stellar object
(YSO). The YSO is characterised by an eﬀective temperature
and radius with values which are summarised in Table 2.

Values given for parameters shown with an apostrophe ((cid:48)) are varied in

Our reference model consists of a spherical distribution of per-
fectly mixed gas and dust around a stellar heating source in its
centre (see Sect. 2). The density distribution is given in Eq. 1;
The size distribution of the dust grains is given in Eq. 2. An
overview of the parameters of the reference model is shown in
Table 2.

In the following sections, we perform simulations using the
reference model and vary only one particular parameter at a time
to consider the behaviour of the degree of polarization in various
Bok globules.

We calculate the degree of polarization from the simulated

thermal emission of the dust phase as follows:

(cid:113)

Pl =

+ F2
F2

FI

.

Here, FQ and FU are the linear polarization components of the
Stokes vector where FI is the intensity component. The circular
polarization component FV is negligible in our scenarios, com-
pared to the linear components and, therefore, not considered
in subsequent discussions. Owing to the characteristics of the
Stokes vector, the degree of polarization only provides informa-
tion about the magnetic ﬁeld components in the plane of sky
(POS).

Bok globule mass
We begin our investigations with the inﬂuence of the Bok glob-
ule mass and, therefore, the optical depth on the polarized emis-
sion of Bok globules. For this purpose, we simulate the thermal
emission of our reference model with total masses of Mgas =
{8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40} M(cid:12). These total masses corre-
spond to the following optical depths:

Mgas = 8 M(cid:12) :
Mgas = 12 M(cid:12) :
Mgas = 16 M(cid:12) :
Mgas = 20 M(cid:12) :
Mgas = 24 M(cid:12) :
Mgas = 28 M(cid:12) :
Mgas = 32 M(cid:12) :
Mgas = 36 M(cid:12) :
Mgas = 40 M(cid:12) :

τ850 µm = 0.12 (AV = 10)
τ850 µm = 0.18 (AV = 15)
τ850 µm = 0.24 (AV = 20)
τ850 µm = 0.3 (AV = 25)
τ850 µm = 0.36 (AV = 30)
τ850 µm = 0.42 (AV = 35)
τ850 µm = 0.48 (AV = 40)
τ850 µm = 0.54 (AV = 45)
(AV = 50).
τ850 µm = 0.6

Here, the optical depth is derived for the distance between the
centre and the boundary of our Bok globule model (λ = 850 µm).
Figure 1 illustrates the degree of polarization vs. the normalized
intensity. Within the chosen mass range, the optical depth eﬀect
decreases the degree of polarization by about 2% to 10%. Com-
pared with observations, this decrease amounts to about 10% to
70% of the decrease as seen in observations (see Fig. 2). This
result appears to be in contrast to the RAT theory that causes a
better alignment of the dust grains close to the radiation source.
However, the degree of polarization depends not only on the
alignment of dust grains but also, for instance, on the optical
depth as seen in Fig. 1.

Inﬂuence of the optical depth
Since the optical depth has a great inﬂuence on the polarized
emission of Bok globules, we analyse how the optical depth in-
ﬂuences linear polarization in general. For this, we have to adjust
our reference model to feature optically thin, as well as opti-
cally thick line-of-sights. Therefore, we consider a total mass of
Mgas = 40 M(cid:12) and simulate the thermal emission at λ = 450 µm.
Figure 3 illustrates a strong variation in the degree of polariza-
tion, which can be explained with the optical properties of elon-
gated dust grains.
The average thermal emission of an elongated dust grain can
be split into a component of the longer ⊥ and the shorter (cid:107) axis:

The work of Reissl et al. (2014) shows a similar analysis, but
focuses on the sign change of the Stokes vector Q-component
instead of the critical distance.

If we use the cross-sections of our dust grain model, scrit cor-
responds to an optical depth in the order of about one but always
lower than one. The quantity scritndust becomes unity in the limit
of spherical dust grains, which is expected from analytical con-
siderations (Poisson distribution).

Therefore, we can distinguish three diﬀerent cases for the
polarized emission of an elongated dust grain (see Fig. 4). If

s < scrit, the dichroic emission dominates the degree of polar-
ization. With s = scrit, the dichroic emission and extinction com-
pensate each other and the degree of polarization is zero. In the
case of s > scrit, the dichroic extinction increases the degree of
polarization again and rotates the polarization angle by 90◦. The
precise value of τcrit depends on the distribution, orientation, and
geometrical shape of the dust grains.

A signiﬁcant decrease in the degree of polarization is there-
fore achievable with a line-of-sight optical depth in the order of
one.

Dust grain size

Besides the dust mass, the dust grain size is also expected to have
a great impact on several characteristics of a Bok globule. For
instance, the absorption and extinction cross-sections are highly
dependent on the dust grain size (distribution) and inﬂuence the
optical depth (see Eqs. 9 and 10). The radiative torque alignment
is also sensitive to the size of the dust grains. We therefore in-
vestigate the inﬂuence of diﬀerent dust grain size distributions
on the behaviour of the degree of polarization in Bok globules.
For this purpose, we simulate our reference model using diﬀer-
ent maximum dust grain sizes amax ∈ {2, . . . , 200, . . . , 2000} µm.
These maximum dust grain sizes correspond to the following op-

extinction (black). This illustration is also valid for oblate dust grains, because the key eﬀect is the same. E is the electric ﬁeld vector component
parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld B. The critical distance scrit is taken from Eq. 13, Pl is the degree of polarization and θ is the
polarization angle relative to the x-axis. The radiation of the absorbing dust grains (black) is not taken into account.

(AV = 90)
τ850 µm = 0.12 (AV = 10)

Here, the optical depth is derived for the distance between the
centre and the boundary of our Bok globule model (Mgas =
8 M(cid:12), λ = 850 µm).
As illustrated in Fig. 5 (top), the distribution of the degree
of polarization vs. intensity shows between amax ∼ 2 µm and
amax ∼ 30 µm a maximum in the high intensity central region
and a signiﬁcant decrease towards the outer low intensity parts
of the Bok globule. Even up to amax ∼ 80 µm, no polarization
hole can be seen in the proﬁle (see Fig. 5, middle). Polarization
holes only occur with dust grains above amax ∼ 80 µm (see Fig.
5, bottom). Furthermore, these threshold values of the maximum
dust grain size hardly depend on the total Bok globule mass.

As illustrated in Fig. 5 (bottom), dust grain size distributions
with amax > 80 µm generally decrease the degree of polariza-
tion of the Bok globule model with increasing size. According
to the work of Weidenschilling & Ruzmaikina (1994), the dens-
est regions in Bok globules are expected to consist of larger dust
grains than the less dense regions. For instance, with dust grains
up to a few 100 µm in the centre of the Bok globule model and
grains smaller than 10 µm in the surroundings, a diﬀerence of
the degree of polarization of P ∼ 10% can be achieved.

Dust grain composition
The composition of dust grains in Bok globules is not exactly
known and may be diﬀerent in the Bok globule core and en-
velope (Olofsson & Olofsson 2011). As used in the reference
model, the MRN-dust composition is a popular choice which
is in agreement with many observations. However, the ratio
between silicate and graphite grains does not need to be the

same in every part of a Bok globule. To investigate the inﬂu-
ence of the relative abundance on the degree of polarization, we
simulate the reference model with MRN-dust and dust grains
that consist of only one component. As illustrated in Fig. 6,
graphite grains cause an overall higher degree of polarization
and a slightly stronger decrease in the degree of polarization than
silicate grains.

Olofsson & Olofsson (2011) mention that the dust phase
in the centre of the Bok globule B335 consists of much more
graphite grains than the surroundings. This may also occur in
other Bok globules and increase in the degree of polarization to-
wards the higher amount of graphite grains. In that case, mech-
anisms which cause polarization holes in Bok globules need to
compensate for the inﬂuence of the higher amount of aligned
graphite grains. However, this impact of the graphite grains is
only true as long as they align with the magnetic ﬁeld, which
is proposed by the works of Clayton et al. (2003) and Draine
& Li (2007). In contrast, (Mathis 1986; Lazarian 2007; Ander-
sson et al. 2015) mentioned that graphite grains do not align
with the magnetic ﬁeld. If the latter statement is correct, the de-
gree of polarization decreases in regions with a higher amount of
graphite grains, which supports polarization holes. For instance,
taking MRN-composition in the central region of the Bok glob-
ule model and pure silicate in the surroundings into account, the
decrease in the degree of polarization amounts to ∼ 5% (see Fig.
6).

Radiative torque alignment

As described in Sect. 2, the eﬃciency of the radiative torque
alignment depends strongly on the free parameter fhigh,J. To esti-
mate a potential inﬂuence on the optical depth eﬀect and the de-
gree of polarization in general, we simulate our reference model
using values of fhigh,J from 0 to 1.0 in 0.2 steps. As predicted, an
increase in fhigh,J causes a great increase in the degree of polar-

et al. 2001). We therefore estimate that the mean value of fhigh,J
is less than 0.4 in Bok globules, which is in agreement with the
results of Hoang & Lazarian (2008).

As mentioned in Sect. 2, a constant value of fhigh,J in the
whole Bok globule is not expected in reality. A spatial variation
in fhigh,J is more suitable for taking variations in the tempera-
ture and density distribution into account. Because of the high
temperature and density in the centre of Bok globules, a lower
ratio of fast to low spinning dust grains is reasonable. As illus-
trated in Fig. 7, a lower value of fhigh,J in the dense regions of
Bok globules would decrease the degree of polarization. This
eﬀect is similar to the explanation of increased disalignment ow-
ing to higher temperature and density, but can now be explained
by fewer dust grains, which rotate at high angular momentum
considering the RAT theory.

Bok globules with no central protostar
Some Bok globules have starless cores instead of one or more
central protostars (Launhardt et al. 2010). With our present re-
sults, we discuss the eﬀect of a missing central protostar on the
degree of polarization.

The critical distance scrit of the optical depth eﬀect depends
mainly on the alignment eﬃciency in the most massive regions
(see Inﬂuence of the optical depth in Sect. 3). Without a cen-
tral protostar, these regions, which are mainly the core of a Bok
globule, are not well irradiated by an external radiation source
and, therefore, not eﬃciently aligned by the RAT mechanism.
As a result, the emission of the core is not strongly polarized and
the aforementioned optical depth eﬀect is rather weak. However,
since the dust grains in the core are not well aligned, the de-
gree of polarization is still decreasing towards the dense regions
of Bok globules. Thus, we expect that the polarized emission of
Bok globules with or without a central protostar show the same
trend, but based on diﬀerent underlying physical eﬀects.

Further investigations
At shorter wavelengths (e.g. λ = 450 µm), the line-of-sight op-
tical depth increases which inﬂuences the degree of polarization
as described in Sect. 3 (see Fig. 3). Observations of Bok glob-
ules at shorter wavelengths could be used to constrain the impact
of the optical depth eﬀect on the degree of polarization. The im-
ages in Fig. 8 show the diﬀerence between the polarization maps
at λ = 450 µm and λ = 850 µm of our reference model using
diﬀerent total masses. A large diﬀerence of the linear polariza-
tion can be related to a great impact of the optical depth eﬀect
at λ = 850 µm (Fig. 8, middle). This impact is even greater if
the degree of polarization is in the same order of magnitude at
both wavelengths, but has its orientation shifted by 90◦ (Fig. 8,
bottom).

A possible observation could be performed with SCUBA-
2/JCMT at λ = 450 µm. From simulations of our reference
I ∼ 19 mJy/beam
model, we obtain a required sensitivity of ∆F(cid:48)
to resolve the important inner region of the Bok globule (Wardle
& Kronberg 1974; Wolf et al. 2002):

Here, ∆γ is the required resolution of the polarization angle, FI

map (ﬁeld of view of ∼ 3(cid:48)) and standard values for weather and
airmass of the SCUBA-2 Integration Time Calculator (Holland
et al. 2013) into consider, we derive an observation time of about
two hours and 15 minutes.

4. Conclusions
We investigated the inﬂuence of various physical conditions and
quantities on the occurrence of polarization holes in Bok glob-
ules and the degree of polarization in general. Under selected
circumstances, we found that variations in the optical depth, the
dust grain size, and the dust grain composition signiﬁcantly in-
ﬂuence the degree of polarization in Bok globules.

The conditions under which the optical depth signiﬁcantly
decreases the degree of polarization are summarised as follows:

1. Dust grain growth to submm/mm size

The absorption cross-section of dust grains grown to 80 µm

or less (spectral index of > 3 or β > 1) is too low, in com-
bination with typical column densities of Bok globules, to
cause a signiﬁcant decrease in the degree of polarization.
However, dust grains grown to submm/mm size are able to
decrease the polarization and are consistent with the spectral
index derived from observed ﬂuxes of various Bok globules
at λ = 850 µm and λ = 1.3 mm (τ < 3 or β < 1).

2. Hydrogen column density of NH ∼ 1028m−2

Given the dust grain growth above, the column density needs
to be in the order of magnitude of about 1028m−2 to de-
crease the degree of polarization by up to ∆P ∼ 10 %.
This corresponds to a total mass of some 10 M(cid:12) inside of
1.5·104 AU×1.5·104 AU which is in agreement with masses
found for Bok globules.

The following physical quantities and conditions are also able to
signiﬁcantly decrease the degree of polarization in Bok globules:
1. Larger dust grains limited to dense regions

A gradient of the dust grain size towards submm/mm grains
in the dense regions of Bok globules is able to decrease the
degree of polarization by up to ∆P ∼ 10 %.

2. Unaligned graphite grains accumulated in dense regions
The combination of graphite grains that are not aligned with
the magnetic ﬁeld and a higher amount of graphite grains in
dense regions of Bok globules is able to decrease the degree
of polarization by up to ∆P ∼ 5%.

3. Less eﬃcient grain alignment in the central region

If the higher density and temperature in the dense regions
of Bok globules reduce the amount of dust grains that rotate
at high angular momentum, the degree of polarization de-
creases by up to ∆P ∼ 10 % by applying the RAT theory and
assuming fhigh,J < 0.4.

4. No central stellar heating source

In Bok globules without a central stellar heating source, the
degree of polarization is expected to decrease similarly to
Bok globules with a heating source. This is caused by the
low alignment eﬃciency in the central dense core, which is
due to the weak irradiation from external radiation sources.

In addition to increased disalignment and twisted magnetic ﬁeld
lines, we found that the above conditions (optical depth, dust
grain size, and dust grain composition) provide an explanation
for the signiﬁcant decrease in linear polarization towards dense
regions of Bok globules. Given typical physical conditions in
Bok globules, several eﬀects are likely to cause the observed po-
larization holes together.
