Abstract. Recently, two of us have studied iron line reverberation mapping to test black
hole candidates, showing that the time information in reverberation mapping can better
constrain the Kerr metric than the time-integrated approach. Motivated by this ﬁnding,
here we explore the constraining power of another time-dependent measurement: an AGN
iron line eclipse. An obscuring cloud passes between the AGN and the distant observer,
covering diﬀerent parts of the accretion disk at diﬀerent times. Similar to the reverberation
measurement, an eclipse might help to better identify the relativistic eﬀects aﬀecting the
X-ray photons. However, this is not what we ﬁnd. We explain our results pointing out an
important diﬀerence between reverberation and eclipse measurements.

Over the past 60 years general relativity has been tested in diﬀerent regimes and environ-
ments. The Schwarzschild solution has been tested in the Solar System [1] and recently, this
quest has been also shifted to the full nonlinear regime of the theory by the Laser Interfer-
ometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) observations, which had demonstrated the
existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems, by detecting for the ﬁrst time gravita-
tional waves produced by a binary black hole merger [2]. It seems now that we are starting to
test general relativity in the strong gravity regime, where deviations from standard predic-
tions can more likely manifest. In this context, astrophysical black hole candidates appear
to be the best laboratories to probe strong gravitational ﬁelds and to do so, there are at
least two approaches. One is based on the study of their electromagnetic spectrum, mainly
through the analysis of the features of the radiation emitted from the inner part of the ac-
cretion disk [4–6] and the second one relies on the study of gravitational waves radiated by
systems with at least one black hole candidate [7].

In the framework of general relativity, the spacetime around astrophysical black holes
should be well described by the Kerr solution, since initial deviations from the Kerr metric
are expected to be quickly radiated away with the emission of gravitational waves [8]. Electric
charge neutrality can be reached very quickly, because of the highly ionized host environ-
ment of these objects, and it is completely negligible in the case of macroscopic bodies [9].
Furthermore, the mass of the accretion disk is typically many orders of magnitude lower than
the mass of the black hole and its impact on the geometry of the spacetime can be safely
ignored [10]. Therefore, the detection of possible deviations from the Kerr solution should
thus be attributed to new physics.

The continuum-ﬁtting and the iron line methods are currently the leading techniques
to probe the spacetime geometry around black hole candidates [11–16], and their use to test
the Kerr metric has been investigated in a number of recent papers [17–31] (for a review, see
Ref. [32]). The main problem to test black hole candidates is parameter degeneracy:
it is
always challenging to constrain new physics because features in the spectrum associated to
possible deviations from the Kerr geometry may be reproduced by standard physics with a
diﬀerent conﬁguration of the system.

Recently, two of us have investigated in Refs. [33, 34] the possibility of testing the Kerr
metric with iron line reverberation mapping, i.e., the time-evolution of the iron line proﬁle in
response to ﬂuctuations in the X-ray primary source. The results unambiguously show that

the time information in reverberation mapping can better constrain the background metric
than the time-integrated iron line measurement, and this is true even for deviations from the
Kerr geometry that do not leave any characteristic feature in the time-integrated proﬁle.

Motivated by such a positive result, here we study the constraining power of another
time-dependent measurement, an AGN iron line eclipse, which is expected to be a not too
rare event [35]. In this context, an obscuring cloud passes between the AGN and the observer,
covering diﬀerent parts of the accretion disk at diﬀerent times. Similar to the reverberation
measurement of an AGN, the iron line eclipse may oﬀer the opportunity to better identify
the relativistic eﬀects aﬀecting the X-ray photons, which would help to better constrain the
Kerr metric.

Our simulations, however, show that this is not the case. While such a conclusion is not
obvious a priori, there are a few important diﬀerences between reverberation mapping and
eclipse measurement. We ﬁnd that the key-point is related to the capability of separating
photons from diﬀerent parts of the disk.
In the reverberation approach, photons emitted
from diﬀerent regions are detected at diﬀerent time, and this is a very clean way to study the
relativistic eﬀects from each patch of the disk. However, in the eclipse scenario we have the
opposite case, namely we have to ﬁgure out the properties of the radiation from every region
of the accretion disk from the non-detection of the photons from that patch. In other words,
we have to ﬁgure out the properties of the radiation by subtracting diﬀerent spectra. If the
cloud covers a small region, it is diﬃcult to measure a diﬀerence and, if the cloud covers a
large region, we lose the information of the exact emission region on the disk.

Other eﬀects seem to play a minor role in the diﬀerence between reverberation mapping
and eclipse measurement. For instance, in the eclipse measurement we have also a loss of
photons due to the passage of the cloud, while no loss is in the reverberation observation
with respect to the standard time-integrated measurement. This also does not improve an
eclipse measurement.

This paper is organized as follows. The theoretical set-up of our work is presented in
Section 2. Section 3 describes the set-up and methods of our simulations. Section 4 is devoted
to discuss our results and Section 5 to the conclusions.

2 Theoretical framework

The electromagnetic spectrum depends on the motion of the gas in the accretion disk and
on the propagation of the photons from the emission point in the strong gravity ﬁeld to the
detection point in the ﬂat faraway region. Tests based on the study of the electromagnetic
radiation can thus probe the metric around a black hole candidate. For instance, with this
approach we cannot distinguish a Kerr black hole of general relativity from a Kerr black
hole in another theory of gravity, because there is no diﬀerence in the geodesic motion [36].
This is exactly the same situation as that of experiments of general relativity in the Solar
System, in which we can test the Schwarzschild solution in the weak ﬁeld limit, but we cannot
distinguish the Schwarzschild metric in general relativity from the Schwarzschild metric in
another theory of gravity.

This electromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas in the inner part of the accretion
disk is strongly aﬀected by the relativistic eﬀects experienced by these photons when they
are close to the black hole candidate. Therefore, the geometry of the spacetime produces
speciﬁc signatures in the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing us, at least in principle, to test
the nature of the compact object.

In order to test the Kerr metric in a model-independent way and quantify possible devi-
ations from the Kerr solution, it is common to consider a more general metric than the Kerr
solution and that includes the Kerr solution as a special case. The metric is characterized
by the mass M and the spin angular momentum J of the compact object, as well as by a
number of “deformation parameters” [37–41]. The latter are used to quantify possible devia-
tions from the Kerr geometry and are assumed a priori unknown constants to be determined
by observations. In other words, by measuring these deformation parameters we can check
whether they vanish, as it is required by the Kerr metric. If observations required at least
a non-vanishing deformation parameter, black hole candidates would not be the Kerr black
holes of general relativity.

Due to the nature of the simulations we do in this work, in which we range over several
parameters, described in Sec. 3, we have employed the simplest version of the Johannsen-
Psaltis metric presented in Ref. [38], in which there is only one deformation parameter 3. In
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, the line element reads

If 3 = 0, the object is a Kerr black hole. If 3 > 0 (< 0), the object is more oblate (prolate)

3 Set-up of the simulation

Since the aim of this paper is to study the constraining power of an iron line eclipse mea-
surement with respect to the standard time-integrated observation without eclipse, we have
performed some simulations of iron line measurement either with or without eclipse, with
the set-up described bellow.

We employ the Novikov-Thorne model to describe a thin accretion disk in the plane
perpendicular the the black hole spin and with the inner edge of the disk at the radius of
the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). The background geometry is described by the
dimensionless spin parameter a∗ = a/M and the deformation parameter 3 of the metric
introduced in Sec. 2. The mass M only sets the size of the system and it does not directly
aﬀects the reﬂected component. The viewing angle is i and corresponds to the angle between
the spin axis and the line of sight of the observer. For the sake of simplicity, the emissivity
proﬁle is taken to be a power law with emissivity index q = 3; that is, Ie ∝ r−3. The iron
line signal is added to a power-law continuum with photon index Γ.
The simulations for the time-integrated measurements are done as in Ref. [27]. We
consider a reference Kerr model with spin parameter a(cid:48)∗, viewing angle i(cid:48), we assume a
certain number of counts in the iron line, Nline, and we add the power-law continuum with
photon index Γ(cid:48) = 2 to have 100 times the number of iron line photons when integrated over
the energy range 1-9 keV. This corresponds to an equivalent width of EW ≈ 370-440 eV,
depending on the line shape.

Figure 1. Sketch of our set-up to describe the observation of an AGN eclipse. In this picture, the
image plane of the observer is divided into 8 slices, every slices has a width of 5 M , and the cloud has
a width of 10 M (X and Y in units in which M = 1). See the text for more details.

We add Poisson noise to the reference model and treat this spectrum as a real obser-
vation. The spectrum is binned to achieve threshold counts, here nmin = 20, and is then
compared with the spectra expected from Johannsen-Psaltis black holes with spin parameter
a∗, deformation parameter 3, viewing angle i, photon index of the continuum Γ, and ratio
between the continuum and the iron line ﬂux K. The other parameters of the model are
ﬁxed. Then we employ the standard χ2 analysis used in ﬁtting data and we study the con-
tour levels of ∆χ2 = χ2 − χ2
min to ﬁnd the constraints that could be obtained from a similar
observation.

For the eclipse scenario, the approach is the same and we consider a set of diﬀerent
conﬁgurations. Our general set-up is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The image plane
of the distant observer is divided into a number vertical slices, all of the same width. The
obscuring cloud completely covers some slices (the exact number depends on the width of the
cloud) and moves from one side of the image to the other side. If the photon count without
eclipse is Nline, in the presence of an eclipse is lower. The exact number mainly depends on
the size of the cloud and only weakly on the background metric, the viewing angle, and the
slice width. In the simplest case, every measurement of the reﬂected component corresponds
to a static conﬁguration and the measurement after is that in which the cloud has moved by
one slice. We have also studied more complicated conﬁgurations that takes into account the
cloud motion and every measurement corresponds to a set of diﬀerent static conﬁgurations.
Unlike reverberation observations studied in Ref. [34], where only the height of the
corona matters and the behavior of the system is otherwise established by the constant of
the speed of light, here diﬀerent eclipse conﬁgurations can provide diﬀerent results. The
number and width of slices and the width of the cloud inevitably aﬀect the ﬁnal result and
the constraining capability of an eclipse measurement.

For instance, if the number of measurements increases, namely the number of observa-
tions in which the cloud is in diﬀerent positions, the constraining power typically improves
if we have suﬃcient photons in the iron line and it is irrelevant for a low number of photon
count. This pattern is completely understandable, since more observations means a higher

resolution in the tomography of the accretion disk. However, this also increases the number
of channels and dilutes the photons. If the photon count is low, the intrinsic noise of the
source prevents an improvement of the measurement and eventually the accuracy of an ob-
servation is determined by Nline, namely by the eﬀective area of the X-ray detector, and a
higher time resolution does not provide any advantage.

The size of the cloud plays also a role in the ﬁnal result. If the width of the cloud is too
large, the photon count decreases, but even the power of the resolution of the tomography. If
the cloud is too small, we need a very high number of photon count to be able to reconstruct
the properties of the radiation in the region covered by the cloud.

We have considered a number of diﬀerent conﬁgurations in the eclipse case, by changing
the number of slices, the number of observations of the eclipse and the size and geometry of

the obscuring cloud. We have also investigated the impact of diﬀerent black hole spins and
viewing angles. With our initial surprise, we have always found that the time-integrated and
the eclipse measurements substantially provide similar results. Depending on the exact choice
of the eclipse model and on the photon count in the iron line Nline, the eclipse measurement
can be somewhat better or somewhat worse than the standard time-integrated measurement.
This is deﬁnitively in sharp contrast with the results for reverberation mapping [34]. In the
case of reverberation, its constraint power is already slightly better than the time-integrated
observation for Nline = 103, which roughly corresponds to a current good observation of
an AGN. For Nline = 104, the reverberation measurement is clearly better and it is also
possible to constrain some deviations from Kerr that do not leave speciﬁc signatures in the
time-integrated observations [34].

Figs. 2-3 show the constraints obtained by simulating standard time-integrated measure-
ments without eclipse. Fig. 2 is for Nline = 104, while Fig. 3 shows the results for Nline = 105.

The spin parameter is a(cid:48)∗ = 0.25 in the left panels and a(cid:48)∗ = 0.8 in the right panels. As Nline
increases, the eﬀect of the Poisson noise is reduced, and the constraint gets stronger.
Fig. 4 shows the constraints obtained by simulating an eclipse for Nline = 104. As in
Figs. 2-3, the spin parameter is a(cid:48)∗ = 0.25 in the left panel and a(cid:48)∗ = 0.8 in the right panel.
Here the slice width is 2 M , the cloud width is 6 M , and we consider 16 observations (at any
observation, the cloud simply moves by one slice). The cloud starts from X ≈ −15 M in the
image plane of the observer and at the end of the observation is at X ≈ 15 M . These plots
clearly show that the standard approach and the eclipse measurement provide essentially
the same kind of constraints. In the simulations of Ref. [34], the time-information in the
reverberation measurement was a clear advantages for testing the Kerr metric and constrain-
ing the deformation parameter. The same constraining power of reverberation mapping
with Nline = 104 was already somewhat better than a time-integrated measurement with
Nline = 105.

4 Discussion

In the previous section, we have described our set-up and showed the results of some simula-
tions. While we have considered several diﬀerent conﬁgurations by changing the parameters
of the eclipse model, our conclusion is that the time-information in the observation of an
AGN eclipse does not provide the unambiguous advantages found in the reverberation case
to test the Kerr metric. In this section, we try to understand the reason.

The simplest way to ﬁgure out the diﬀerence between a reverberation and an eclipse
measurement is probably to consider a set of models, ranging from one very similar to a
reverberation measurement, for which we expect to recover the reverberation results, to an
eclipse model. With this spirit, we consider the following ﬁve models:

1. Model 0 – Standard time-integrated iron line measurement, to be compared with the
other models to see when and why the other models provide better results. We consider
Nline = 104 (photons in the iron line), and we adopt a small disk with inner edge at the
ISCO and outer edge at the radius rout = rISCO + 16 M . These choices will be adopted
even in the other models.

2. Model A – For the model similar to a reverberation measurement, we divide the disk
into 16 regions, each of them is an annulus with an inner radius rin and an outer radius
rout = rin + M . The ﬁrst annulus has rin = rISCO and rout = rISCO + M . The second
annulus has rin = rISCO + M and rout = rISCO + 2 M , etc. until the last annulus with
rin = rISCO + 15 M and rout = rISCO + 16 M . Similar to a reverberation measurement,
we assume to be able to measure the iron line proﬁle from each annulus. Then we
compare every annulus of the reference model with its counterpart of the comparison
model.

3. Model B – In order to consider something between the model A and an eclipse observa-
tion, we divide the image plane of the distant observer into 16 vertical slices. However,
like in a reverberation measurement, we assume to be able to measure the 16 spectra
from each slice and we proceed in the data analysis as in the case of the model A, by
comparing the spectrum from every slice of the reference model with its counterpart of
the comparison model.

4. Model C – We start again from the model A and we consider a modiﬁcation to make
it closer to an eclipse, but diﬀerent from the model B. We maintain the conﬁgurations
with 16 annuli, but we assume that a “cloud” only covers one of this annulus. In the
ﬁrst observation, there is no cloud. In the second observation, the cloud covers the ﬁrst
annulus with rin = rISCO and rout = rISCO + M . In the third observation, the cloud
covers the second annulus with rin = rISCO + M and rout = rISCO + 2 M , and so on.
The cloud moves to larger radii and in the last observation it covers the annulus with
rin = rISCO + 14 M and rout = rISCO + 15 M .

5. Model D – This model corresponds to an eclipse measurement with 16 vertical slices.
The cloud has a width of 6 M The model D can be obtained from the model B by
introducing the modiﬁcation between the model A and the model C. Alternatively, it
can be obtained from the model C by introducing the modiﬁcation between the model A
and the model B.

For the sake of clarity, we show explicitly in Figs. 5 and 6, how the conﬁgurations
presented in model C and model D aﬀect the total ﬂux of the measurement and the iron
line proﬁle of a Kerr black hole with spin parameter a(cid:48)∗ = 0.80. In particular, Fig. 5 (left

highlighted by the vertical dashed gray lines in the left panel of Fig. 5 (left panel).

measurement), and Fig. 4 the constraints from the model D (eclipse measurement). The

those found in [34] for the case of reverberation mapping. The constraints are somewhat
stronger than those from a time-integrated measurement with Nline = 104. The constraints
become weaker in the model C, and are similar to those from the model D in Fig. 4 for an
eclipse measurement.

5 Conclusions

In Refs. [27, 33, 34], two of us have studied how the iron line in the X-ray spectrum of black
hole candidates can be used to test the Kerr metric. We have considered both time-integrated
and reverberation measurements. Our results clearly show that the time information in the
reverberation measurement can better probe the spacetime geometry around these objects
and provide stronger constraints on possible deviations from the Kerr solution.

Motivated by those results, here we have explored another time-dependent measure-
ment: an AGN eclipse in which an obscuring cloud covers diﬀerent parts of the disk at
diﬀerent times. One may indeed expect to get similar beneﬁts from a reverberation and
an eclipse measurements. However, the simple quantitative analysis reported in this work
shows that this is not the case. The constraints on the metric that can be obtained from
an eclipse observation are typically comparable to those from the standard time-integrated
measurement. The exact set-up of the system can somewhat change the results, but we have
been unable to ﬁnd the signiﬁcant advantages clearly shown in reverberation mapping.

Reverberation and eclipse observations present several diﬀerences. However, we have
found that the actual diﬀerence is made by how the region of the accretion disk are scanned
and one can identify the relativistic eﬀects from each patch of the disk. In the reverberation
case, we observe X-ray photons from diﬀerent regions at diﬀerent time, and it is easy to
reconstruct the spectrum from each region. In an eclipse observation, we have the opposite
case, namely we observe the total spectrum of the disk minus the radiation from the region
covered by the cloud. We have thus to recover the properties of the covered regions by
subtracting iron line proﬁles with small diﬀerences. The result does not change by increasing
the photon count in the iron line Nline. However, we have not directly studied this issue for
very high values of Nline, because eventually the constraints would not be realistic in any
case (systematic eﬀects would be dominant).

Lastly, we would like to point out that our results are not in disagreement with the claim
in Ref. [35], in which the conclusion is that an eclipse can help to observe relativistic eﬀects
in the iron line. The aim of that paper was to distinguish the scenario in which the iron line
signal is produced in the inner part of the accretion disk from the scenario in which the iron
line is produced in moving clouds at larger radii. The fact that an eclipse observation can
show the Doppler redshifted part and the Doppler blueshifted part of the disk at diﬀerent
times is enough to distinguish the two scenarios. In our case, we already assume that the
iron line is produced by ﬂuorescence from the inner part of the accretion disk, and we want
to test the Kerr metric.
