ABSTRACT

Low mass, self-gravitating accretion disks admit quasi-steady, ‘gravito-turbulent’ states in which
cooling balances turbulent viscous heating. However, numerical simulations show that gravito-
turbulence cannot be sustained beyond dynamical timescales when the cooling rate or corresponding
turbulent viscosity is too large. The result is disk fragmentation. We motivate and quantify an inter-
pretation of disk fragmentation as the inability to maintain gravito-turbulence due to formal secondary
instabilities driven by: 1) cooling, which reduces pressure support; and/or 2) viscosity, which reduces
rotational support. We analyze the axisymmetric gravitational stability of viscous, non-adiabatic
accretion disks with internal heating, external irradiation, and cooling in the shearing box approxima-
tion. We consider parameterized cooling functions in 2D and 3D disks, as well as radiative diﬀusion in
3D. We show that generally there is no critical cooling rate/viscosity below which the disk is formally
stable, although interesting limits appear for unstable modes with lengthscales on the order of the
disk thickness. We apply this new linear theory to protoplanetary disks subject to gravito-turbulence
modeled as an eﬀective viscosity, and cooling regulated by dust opacity. We ﬁnd that viscosity ren-
ders the disk beyond ∼ 60AU dynamically unstable on radial lengthscales a few times the local disk
thickness. This is coincident with the empirical condition for disk fragmentation based on a maximum
sustainable stress. We suggest turbulent stresses can play an active role in realistic disk fragmentation
by removing rotational stabilization against self-gravity, and that the observed transition in behavior
from gravito-turbulent to fragmenting may reﬂect instability of the gravito-turbulent state itself.

1. INTRODUCTION

relation,

Understanding the gravitational stability of rotat-
ing disks is central to many astrophysical problems
(Kratter & Lodato 2016).
In the context of gaseous
protostellar or protoplanetary disks (PPDs), gravita-
tional instability (GI) has two applications. It can pro-
vide gravitational torques to transport angular momen-
tum outwards and thus enable mass accretion (Armitage
2011; Turner et al. 2014). GI may also lead to disk
fragmentation, which has been invoked to explain the
formation of stellar/sub-stellar companions or giant
planets at large radii (Boss 1997; Kratter & Matzner
2006; Stamatellos & Whitworth 2009; Helled et al. 2014)
Studying these non-linear phenomena requires direct nu-
merical simulations. Nevertheless, physical insight can
be obtained through analytical modeling.

The standard metric for the (inverse) strength of disk

self-gravity is the Toomre parameter,

Q ≡

csκ
πGΣ

(1)

(Toomre 1964). Here, cs is the isothermal sound-speed,
κ is the epicyclic frequency (which equals the rotation
frequency Ω in a Keplerian disk), Σ is the surface den-
sity and G is the gravitational constant. The Toomre
parameter is a measure of the destabilizing eﬀect of self-
gravity (GΣ) against the stabilizing eﬀect of rotation (κ)
and pressure (cs). This is evident from the dispersion

which relates the growth rate s and radial wavenumber k
for local, axisymmetric waves in a two-dimensional (2D,
razor-thin), inviscid and isothermal2 disk. When Q < 1,
there is a range of k for which such disturbances are un-
stable. Non-axisymmetric modes can develop for larger,
but still order-unity values of Q (Lau & Bertin 1978;
Papaloizou & Lin 1989; Papaloizou & Savonije 1991).

We emphasize that the oft-used dispersion relation and
corresponding Toomre parameter (Eqs. 1 and 2) are de-
rived from idealized conditions: the base disk is lami-
nar, inviscid, and does not experience any net thermal
losses3 (hereafter ‘cooling’). However, real disks can cool,
for example, due to radiative losses. Accretion disks
may also be turbulent, the dynamic and thermodynamic
eﬀect of which is often modeled through an eﬀective
viscosity (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Lin & Pringle 1987;
Armitage et al. 2001; Raﬁkov 2015).

However, the Toomre parameter is still widely applied
to viscous (turbulent), cooling accretion disk models (e.g.
Gammie 2001; Cossins et al. 2009; Kimura & Tsuribe
2012), despite the mismatch in the included underlying
physics. We show that including non-ideal physics, such
as cooling and viscosity, in fact modiﬁes the classic dis-
persion relation, and hence the condition for GI. Thus
the Toomre condition alone is insuﬃcient to assess GI in

2 Eq. 1—2 also apply to adiabatic disks if one takes cs as the

adiabatic sound-speed.

are exactly balanced at all times, so these do not cool in the current
context.

realistic disks.

The goal of this work is to generalize the analytic treat-
ment of disk GI, by including cooling and viscosity, to al-
low a self-consistent discussion of GI in realistic accretion
disk models. We ﬁrst review in §1.1 and §1.2, respec-
tively, how cooling or viscosity can lead to GI even when
Q > 1, by removing pressure or rotational support. We
then discuss in §1.3—§1.4 how these eﬀects may relate
to the transition from self-regulated GI to fragmentation
seen in numerical simulations. The rest of this paper is
laid out in §1.5.

1.1. Cooling-driven gravitational instability

Cooling reduces pressure support against self-gravity.
The cooling time tc is the timescale over which the disk
temperature T is relaxed to some ﬂoor value, which may
be zero. It is often written as

tc = βΩ−1,

(3)

where β is the corresponding dimensionless cooling time.
This type of parameterized cooling, ﬁrst applied by
Gammie (2001), allows a range of thermodynamic re-
sponses to be explored.

In reality, PPD cooling is controlled by radiation
from dust grains (Bell & Lin 1994; D’Alessio et al. 1997;
Chiang & Goldreich 1997). Although most PPDs sub-
ject to GI are optically thick, cooling parameterized by
the β model formally only captures optically thin cooling
when used in numerical simulations. It is, however, pos-
sible to modify the standard cooling function to mimic
optically-thick cooling (see, e.g. §6).
Previous work has quantiﬁed the role of cooling pri-
marily as a means to reduce the sound speed term in Q
(though see e.g., Clarke et al. 2007). Here we will quan-
tify how cooling enables GI even when Q > 1. For exam-
ple, if perturbations can cool to arbitrarily low temper-
atures (which, in fact, is a common cooling prescription
in numerical simulations), we ﬁnd the above dispersion
relation is modiﬁed to read

s2 = 2πGΣ|k| − κ2 − γ(cid:18) tcs

1 + tcs(cid:19) c2

sk2,

(4)

where γ is the adiabatic index. Cooling increases the
growth rate by reducing the magnitude of the pressure
term.
In fact, for tc ∈ [0,∞) a formal condition for
instability is

2πGΣ|k| > κ2,

which is what would be obtained from Eq. 2 with pres-
sure neglected (cs → 0). This condition does not actu-
ally depend on the cooling time, and instability is possi-
ble for any ﬁnite Q. Thus, the mere presence of cooling
changes the qualitative nature of GI compared to the
simple Toomre condition.

1.2. Viscosity-driven gravitational instability

Viscous disks can also develop GI even when Q > 1.
This is because, as demonstrated below, viscosity re-
moves rotational support against self-gravity for long-
wavelength disturbances (Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974;
Willerding 1992; Gammie 1996). A similar eﬀect oc-
curs in dusty ﬂuids where the required frictional forces
are provided by dust-gas drag (Goodman & Pindor 2000;

M.-K. Lin & K. M. Kratter

Ward 2000; Takahashi & Inutsuka 2014).
In fact, this
is a mechanism to enhance particle clumping for plan-
etesimal formation (Youdin 2005, 2011). Therefore it is
not unreasonable to expect analogous fragmentation in
gaseous disks due to viscosity.

It is conventional to write the kinematic viscosity ν as

ν = α

c2
s
Ω

,

(5)

where α is
the dimensionless viscosity coeﬃcient
Shakura & Sunyaev (1973). This parameterization can
be modiﬁed to include more complex dependencies on
the ﬂuid variables, but Eq. 5 is the general form.

For an isothermal, viscous, self-gravitating disk in 2D,
Gammie (1996) ﬁnds the approximate dispersion relation

νk2(cid:0)2πGΣ|k| − c2
sk2(cid:1)
sk2 − 2πGΣ|k|

κ2 + c2

s ≃

.

(6)

Assuming Q > 1, instability occurs if

2πGΣ > c2

s|k|,

provided that νk2 6= 0. This condition for viscous GI
is identical to what would be obtained from Eq. 2 with
rotation neglected (Ω → 0). That is, a classically stable
disk can be destabilized by viscosity as it reduces rota-
tional stabilization (Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974).

For gaseous accretion disks, a Navier-Stokes viscos-
ity is often implemented (as above) to mimic hydro-
dynamic or magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence
(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). How well turbulence can
be modeled as an eﬀective viscosity is a separate issue
(Balbus & Papaloizou 1999). However, it is reasonable
to assume that these mechanisms, which are observed in
simulations to transport angular momentum outwards
(and mass inwards), frustrate rotational support.

In this work, we use viscosity to model two possible
physical eﬀects of turbulence: heating via dissipation and
angular momentum transport. We emphasize that our
model for GI enabled by viscosity (hereafter viscous GI)
does not assume a particular origin for the viscosity. GI
itself or other forms of magnetic or hydrodynamic turbu-
lence are allowed in this framework. We will generalize
the theory of viscous GI to include an energy equation
with viscous heating, irradiation, explicit cooling, as well
as three-dimensionality (3D) in order to consider viscous
GI in more realistic PPD models.

1.3. Relevance to gravito-turbulent disk fragmentation

We develop a general framework for viscous disks with-
out assuming a speciﬁc origin for the viscosity. We will,
however, apply the theory to ‘gravito-turbulent’ disks in
which the viscosity is associated with some underlying
(classic) GI, as described below.

Consider an initially laminar, Q ≫ 1 disk, without
external heating, as it cools. The disk temperature will
decline until Q = O(1), whence non-axisymmetric modes
grow and heat the disk through the dissipation of spiral
shocks (Cossins et al. 2009). This setup permits a quasi-
steady, turbulent state with Q = O(1) in which cooling
is balanced by shock heating to maintain thermal equi-
librium (Gammie 2001; Shi & Chiang 2014).

Global disk simulations (e.g. Lodato & Rice 2004)
show that the transport and heating associated with this

Non-ideal Gravitational instability

3

gravito-turbulence may be described as a local viscous
process provided that the disk-to-star mass ratio is small
(. 0.25) and the disk is thin (aspect-ratio . 0.1).

In this case the α and β parameters deﬁned above are
inversely related (see, e.g. Eq. 24). Recent vertically-
extended shearing box simulations also conﬁrm this re-
lation in 3D disks (Shi & Chiang 2014).

Numerical experiments, however, show that if the cool-
ing time is too small (or the viscosity is too large), say,

β < βc

(α > αc) ,

(7)

then the disk fragments (Gammie 2001; Rice et al. 2005,
2011). In fact, in the absence of global eﬀects, numerical
simulations show that there are two — and only two
— possible outcomes for self-gravitating, cooling disks:
gravito-turbulence or fragmentation.

2012;

Paardekooper

There is considerable debate on the exact value of
βc and whether or not a critical cooling time can be
deﬁned at all (Meru & Bate 2011; Lodato & Clarke
2011; Meru & Bate
2012;
Hopkins & Christiansen 2013). There are,
in addi-
tion, numerical convergence issues when simulating disk
fragmentation, which we discuss in §7.
However, it is generally accepted that steady, gravito-
turbulent disks do not exist for suﬃciently rapid cooling
or large viscosity (Johnson & Gammie 2003). This is in-
triguing because, as highlighted in §1.1—1.2, cooling or
viscosity can reduce gravitational stability independently
of their inﬂuence on the exact value of the classic Q. This
motivates a physical interpretation of disk fragmentation
as the inability to maintain a gravito-turbulent state due
to secondary instabilities driven by cooling and/or vis-
cosity.

1.4. Instability of the gravito-turbulent state

In this work, we formally treat the gravito-turbulent
disk described above as an equilibrium state, to which
we apply standard linear stability analysis. Thus by ‘per-
turbations’ we mean deviations away from this gravito-
turbulent basic state4.
In our model, we interpret in-
stability of such perturbations to signify fragmentation.
Although we cannot formally demonstrate this, numeri-
cal simulations suggest that gravito-turbulence and frag-
mentations are the only outcomes of classic GI. Thus
the failure to maintain the gravito-turbulent steady state
seems a reasonable description of fragmentation.

Indeed, our linear analysis for perturbations with re-
spect to the gravito-turbulent state predicts that PPDs
will fragment under similar conditions observed in nu-
merical simulations (e.g. βc ∼ 3, αc ∼ 0.1, Gammie
2001; Rice et al. 2005).

1.5. Plan

The basic equations, disk equilibria, cooling and vis-
cosity models are given in §2. The linear stability prob-
lem is deﬁned in §3. We present results with parameter-
ized ‘beta’ cooling in §4 and §5 for 2D and 3D disks, re-
spectively. In §6 we consider PPDs with realistic viscos-
ity/cooling models, including radiative diﬀusion in 3D,
and determine where PPDs are gravitationally unstable

4 This should not be confused with ﬂuctuations with respect to
the laminar disk that maintain the underlying gravito-turbulence.

and why. We summarize our results in §7 with a discus-
sion of how our models may aid the physical understand-
ing of fragmentation in realistic PPDs.

2. BASIC EQUATIONS

We consider a 3D,

self-gravitating, viscous disk
with heating and cooling. We use the shearing
box framework to study a small patch of the disk
(Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965). The local frame co-
rotates with a ﬁducial point in the unperturbed disk at
angular frequency Ω. The Cartesian co-ordinates (x, y, z)
correspond to the radial, azimuthal and vertical direc-
tions in the global disk. The ﬂuid equations are

(9)

+ ∇ · (Ev) = −P∇ · v + Hvisc − Λ + Hext,

(10)

where ρ is the density ﬁeld and v = (vx, vy, vz) is the ve-
locity ﬁeld. We assume an ideal gas so that the pressure
P and thermal energy density E are related by

P = (γ − 1)E = RρT,

(11)
where R is the gas constant and T is the tempera-
ture. For simplicity we refer to the adiabatic index γ
as that in Eq. 11 for both 2D and 3D disk models (cf.
Johnson & Gammie 2003). The gas gravitational poten-
tial Φ is given via the Poisson equation,

∇2Φ = 4πGρ.

(12)

In the momentum equation (Eq.

fourth/ﬁfth, and last term on the right-hand side repre-
sent the Coriolis, tidal, and viscous forces (see below),
respectively. We consider Keplerian disks with shear
parameter q = 3/2 and vertical oscillation frequency
Ωz = Ω.

In the energy equation (Eq. 10) the source terms Hvisc
and Λ represent viscous heating and time-dependent
cooling, respectively, and Hext represents any time-
independent heat source/sinks. We set Hext = 0 unless
otherwise stated.

2.1. Viscosity and heating

The Cartesian components of the viscous stress tensor

T are deﬁned by

(13)

where ρν is the shear viscosity. We also include a bulk
viscosity ρνb for completeness, but will neglect it in nu-
merical calculations. The associated viscous heating is
given by

Hvisc ≡ (∂jvi) Tij,

(14)

where summation over repeated indices is implied.

(15)

In our beta cooling model, the energy loss per unit
volume is speciﬁed as an explicit function of the thermo-
dynamic variables. A prototypical example is

where subscript ‘eq’ denotes the equilibrium state and
c2
s0 ≡ Peq(z = 0)/ρeq(z = 0). The dimensionless viscos-
ity coeﬃcient α = α(ρeq, Peq) characterizes the magni-
tude of the shear viscosity in steady state. The indices
µ, λ are free parameters chosen to model how the viscos-
ity behaves in the perturbed state. We adopt the same
prescription for the bulk viscosity but with α → αb.
Our numerical calculations use µ = −1, λ = 0 so that
ρν is time-independent, following previous studies of vis-
cous GI (Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974; Hunter & Horak
1983; Willerding 1992; Gammie 1996). This choice elimi-
nates viscous over-stability (Schmit & Tscharnuter 1995;
Latter & Ogilvie 2006), which is unrelated to self-gravity,
and would otherwise contaminate our results.

While steady-state viscosity values can be determined
analytically or numerically (e.g. Martin & Lubow 2011;
Kratter et al. 2008; Raﬁkov 2015), the time-dependent
behavior is not well-explored. We emphasize the choice
µ = −1, λ = 0 is made to bring out the physical pro-
cess of interest — viscous GI. Interestingly, though,
Laughlin & Rozyczka (1996) have suggested a ν ∝ 1/Σ
dependence when modeling the evolution of 2D self-
gravitating disks as a viscous process. We note that if
ρν is constant in time then increasing the density corre-
sponds to reduction in the viscosity. This is perhaps con-
sistent with numerical simulations of disk fragmentation
which show that the internal ﬂow of high-density clumps
is laminar (Gammie 2001). However, once clumps form
they may eﬀectively decouple from the background disk
state, and thus no longer be described by the same pre-
scription.

2.2. Steady states and cooling models

We consider equilibrium solutions (here omitting the

‘eq’ subscripts for simplicity)

v = −qΩx ˆy,
ρ = ρ(z),
P = P (z) ≡ c2

s(z)ρ.

The equilibrium density and pressure ﬁelds are obtained
by solving the vertical momentum equation with self-
gravity,

together with thermodynamic equilibrium,

(qΩ)2ρν + Hext = Λ,

where the ﬁrst term represents viscous heating. For the
viscous problem, ν 6= 0, and we set Hext = 0 to obtain
a relation between viscous heating and cooling (e.g. Eq.
24 below). However, if we wish to neglect viscosity (and
the accompanying dissipation) but include cooling, we
must invoke Hext 6= 0 to deﬁne an equilibrium state. To
proceed further, we separately describe the two cooling
models considered in this work.

Λ(ρ, T ) = Rρ

(γ − 1)

(T − Tirr)

tc

,

(22)

where Tirr is a reference temperature ﬁeld, and recall tc =
βΩ−1 is the cooling timescale with β a constant input
parameter. Physically, Tirr may be the ﬂoor temperature
set by, for example, stellar or background irradiation.

Beta cooling of the form Eq. 22 is widely applied in
2D and 3D numerical simulations of self-gravitating disks
(Gammie 2001; Rice et al. 2005, 2011; Paardekooper
2012).
In fact, for Tirr = 0 the cooling function Λ =
E/tc is identical to that originally employed by Gammie
(2001). We will refer to Eq. 22 as ‘standard’ beta cool-
ing. It permits numerical experiments to be carried out
in a controlled manner as a function of the cooling time β.
An adiabatic disk corresponds to β → ∞. The physical
meaning of the limit β → 0 depends on Tirr, as discussed
in §4.1.1—4.1.2.
For standard beta cooling we assume an equilibrium
polytropic relation

P = c2

s0ρ0(cid:18) ρ

ρ0(cid:19)Γ

,

(23)

where ρ0 = ρ(z = 0) is the equilibrium mid-plane density,
and Γ is the constant polytropic index that determines
the disk’s vertical structure. Thus Γ is only relevant to
the 3D problem. The vertical structure is ﬁrst obtained
from Eq. 19—20, then inserted into Eq. 21 to infer
the required viscosity proﬁle for thermal equilibrium. If
Hext = 0,

α(z) =

,

where Teq(z) is the equilibrium temperature ﬁeld. We
shall consider vertically isothermal disks with Γ = 1, as
appropriate for the outer parts of irradiated protoplan-
etary disks (Chiang & Goldreich 1997). In this case α,
Teq and θ are simply constants. Note that θ should only
be interpreted as an irradiation parameter when it is de-
ﬁned through Eq. 25, in conjunction with adopting Eq.
22 as the cooling function.

We assume standard beta cooling in formulating the
linear problem. However, the corresponding linear prob-
lem for any other explicit cooling function, say Λ1(ρ, T ),
can be obtained by equating its linearized form to that
of Eq. 22, i.e.
setting δΛ ≡ δΛ1. This then deﬁnes
the β and θ parameters to be used in the framework we
develop later (see also §3.1). We do this in §6 where we
adopt a more realistic beta cooling function for PPDs. In
that case, θ may or may not directly represent a physical
irradiation.

(27)

where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and κd is the
(dust) opacity. We adopt

κd = κd0T b,

(28)

and take the constant index b = 2 as appropriate for the
cold outer regions of a PPD with ISM-like dust grains
(Bell & Lin 1994), but retain the general notation b to
keep track of the opacity.

In this case, we specify a constant viscosity coeﬃcient
α and solve Eq. 19—21, together with Eq. 26—27, as a
fourth order system of ordinary diﬀerential equations to
obtain equilibrium proﬁles P (z), T (z), and hence ρ(z).

While radiative cooling is arguably more realistic
than beta cooling,
it generally implies a vertically
non-isothermal equilibrium disk, and increases the or-
der of the linearized equations.
It formally applies
to optically-thick disks, but it is possible to modify
the ﬂux function to account for optically-thin disks
(Levermore & Pomraning 1981). However, this compli-
cation is beyond the scope of this work.

Note that any beta cooling function can be linearized
in the form of Eq. 42 with appropriate deﬁnitions of tc
and θ (see §6.2 for an example). For the stability problem
we may simply regard θ as a parameter for the density-
dependence of any generic beta cooling function. If we
speciﬁcally consider standard beta cooling, then θ also
represents physical irradiation.

cooling to the beta cooling prescription, except for spe-
cial problems (e.g. Lin & Youdin 2015).

We now consider the gravitational stability of two
and three dimensional disks in the presence of non-ideal
physics: cooling and viscosity.

4. TWO-DIMENSIONAL DISKS WITH BETA COOLING
We begin in the 2D limit with standard beta cooling
to facilitate comparison with previous studies. The disk
material is assumed to be conﬁned to the mid-plane, and
δvz = 0. We make the replacement ρ → Σ, re-interpret P
as the vertically-integrated pressure, and set Γ = 1. The
gravitational potential perturbation remains 3D and its
mid-plane value is given by

δΦ(z = 0) = −

δΣ

2πG
|k|

(44)

(Shu 1970).

The linearized equations yield an algebraic disper-
sion relation s = s(k). We write this in terms of the
dimensionless growth rate S = s/Ω and wavenumber
K = kH = kcs0/Ω as

f (S, K) ≡ AD − BC = 0,

(45)

where the functions A, B, C, D are given in Appendix A.
We use this generalized dispersion relation to investigate
GI driven by cooling in §4.1; and GI driven by viscosity
in §4.2.

4.1. Inviscid limit

We ﬁrst simplify the problem by setting α = αb = 0.
This eliminates viscous heating and forces in the lin-
earized problem, allowing us to quantify the sole eﬀect of
cooling on the perturbations. We emphasize that desta-
bilization is independent of the eﬀect of decreasing tem-
perature on the instantaneous value of the classic-Q. A
time-independent heat source should be invoked to bal-
ance the imposed cooling to allow an equilibrium to be
deﬁned (Hext 6= 0).
For example, we could assume that the viscosity only
provides a background heating and does not play an ac-
tive role in the perturbed state. This is in fact done im-
plicitly in the literature when discussing fragmentation of
cooling, self-gravitating disk simulations (Gammie 2001).
There, the eﬀect of the ambient gravito-turbulent viscos-
ity on the forming-clump is neglected, as one only com-
pares adiabatic heating and the imposed cooling. This
comparison is encapsulated in the generalized dispersion
relation below.

Eq. 45 becomes
Q − 2(2 − q) −(cid:18) θ + βγS
2|K|

1 + βS (cid:19) K 2,

S2 =

(46)

similar to the classic dispersion relation (Eq. 2), which
may be obtained by taking the limit |βS| → ∞. The
ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side represents destabiliza-
tion by self-gravity; the second and third terms represent
stabilization by rotation and pressure, respectively. The
imposed cooling/irradiation only aﬀects the pressure re-
sponse.

Eq. 46 is a cubic equation in S. The Routh-Hurwitz

criteria imply that stability is ensured if

γ > θ

and Q >

(47)

1

p2θ(2 − q)

are both satisﬁed. A third criterion, 2(2 − q)γQ2 > 1, is
formally required, but this is implied by Eq. 47. Notice
these conditions do not actually depend on the cooling
time. At ﬁxed Q, the second stability condition eventu-
ally fails for decreasing θ, i.e. if perturbations are allowed
to cool to suﬃciently low temperatures.

If only real growth rates are considered, then violating
the second condition in Eq. 47 alone is suﬃcient for
instability. In that case the wavenumbers satisfying

θK 2 −

2
Q|K| + 2(2 − q) < 0

(48)

are unstable. The range of unstable wavenumbers in-
creases with decreasing irradiation θ. For θ ≪ 1 this
range is (2 − q)Q . |K| . 2/θQ. Without irradiation
there is no upper limit to unstable wavenumbers, which
could have implications for numerical simulations prob-
ing large wavenumbers and small scales at high resolution
(see §7.1).
Consider the most unstable wavenumber |K∗| at which
∂S/∂|K| = 0 and S = S∗. By diﬀerentiating Eq. 46, we
obtain

|K∗| =

1 + βS∗

Q (θ + γβS∗)

(49)

Inserting this into Eq. 46, we ﬁnd the maximum growth
rate satisﬁes

S2

∗ =

1 + βS∗

Q2 (θ + βγS∗) − 2(2 − q).

(50)

Eq. 49—50 imply ∂β|K∗|, ∂βS∗ < 0 for γ > θ. Then as
cooling becomes more rapid, the maximum growth rate
increases, and the most unstable wavelength decreases.
For |S∗| ≪ 1, Eq. 50 gives the simple solution

βS∗ ≃

1 − 2(2 − q)Q2θ
2(2 − q)Q2γ − 1

.

(51)

Thus S∗ → 0 as β → ∞, but growth rates are never
zero for any ﬁnite β. That is, the disk can be formally
unstable for arbitrarily long cooling times.

Fig. 1 shows growth rates in a Q = 1.7 disk as a
function of the cooling time β for two irradiation lev-
els θ = 0.1, 0.33. The vertical lines mark characteris-
tic cooling times beyond which the growth timescale is
long compared to the dynamical time. Increasing irra-
diation stabilizes the disk, and faster cooling is required
to achieve the same growth rate as in a disk with weaker
irradiation.

Next, we consider the two limiting cases: θ = 0, so
perturbations are cooled towards zero temperature (typ-
ically employed in numerical simulations, e.g. Gammie
2001); and θ = 1, where the equilibrium disk tempera-
ture equals the irradiation temperature.

4.1.1. θ = 0

For β-cooling with θ = 0, the disk is uncondition-
ally unstable for ﬁnite Q, although instability occurs on

sponds to a pressureless disk (not merely isothermal).

Let us consider a disk with

1

Q =

p2γ(2 − q) ≡ Qcrit,

(52)

which is the condition for marginal stability in an adia-
batic disk. How does ﬁnite cooling destabilize the disk?
Inserting Eq. 52 into Eq. 50 with θ = 0, we ﬁnd

Standard beta cooling with θ = 1 corresponds to ‘ther-
mal relaxation’: the temperature is restored to its ini-
tial value over the cooling time (Lin & Youdin 2015;
Mohandas & Pessah 2015).
In this case no additional
heat source need be invoked to deﬁne an inviscid steady
state. From Eq. 47, the instability condition is Q < 1.
This is the same as the classic Toomre condition for an
isothermal disk (which may be obtained from Eq. 46
by taking |βS| → 0). In this respect, a fully irradiated
disk, in which the equilibrium temperature is set exter-
nally, behaves isothermally regardless of the cooling time
(Gammie 2001; Johnson & Gammie 2003).

4.2. Viscous disk

We now consider a viscous disk with parameters µ =

the 2D case this implies νΣ is constant. We check in Ap-
pendix B that our dispersion relation reduces to previous
results for viscous GI in the isothermal limit (by taking
|βS| → ∞ and γ = 1).
It is useful to consider several limiting cases. To see
the eﬀect of cooling and irradiation, we simplify the dis-
persion relation, Eq. 45, by assuming |βS| ≪ 1. Then
for |K| → 0 we ﬁnd

S ≃

αK 2

2(2 − q)(cid:18) 2|K|

Q − θK 2(cid:19) ,

(55)

which coincides with Gammie’s Eq. 18 for vanishing

rate can be obtained by equating Eq. 55 and 565. This
exercise yields

(53)

S∗ ≃

The maximum growth rate, S∗ ∝ β−1/3, smoothly in-
creases with decreasing β. Notice for β > 1 this growth
rate is faster than the imposed cooling rate β−1Ω.

We can deﬁne a characteristic cooling time β∗ as that
which removes pressure support against self-gravity over
the natural lengthscale in the problem, the scale-height
H. We thus set |K∗| = 1 and ﬁnd, for the Keplerian disk,

β∗ =

1

(cid:0)√γ − 1(cid:1)3/2 .

(54)

This equation gives similar values of the cooling times
below which numerical simulations show dynamical disk
fragmentation (Gammie 2001; Rice et al. 2005, 2011).
These simulations employ the same beta cooling prescrip-
tion with θ = 0, and determine the fragmentation bound-
ary, βc, as a function of the adiabatic index γ. Table 1
shows rough agreement between β∗ and βc. The match
is remarkable, especially with the global 3D simulations
of Rice et al. (2005), since Eq. 54 is derived for 2D disks
in the local limit.

To compute growth rates numerically, we consider a
model with γ = 1.4, αb = 0 and α = α(β) given by
thermal equilibrium (Eq. 24). Furthermore, we relate
the strength of self-gravity and viscosity by

function of the cooling time β for θ = 0. There is good
agreement between numerical growth rates and Eq. 57
for β & 1. Eq. 57 gives the limiting behavior for this
case as

S∗ ∝(cid:26)α1/4β−3/4Q−1 ∝ β−3/2 β ≫ α,
β ≪ α,

α−1/2Q−1 = const.

(59)

where we have applied Eq. 24 and 58. The disk is un-
stable for all β, but growth timescales are long (> 10
orbits) for β & 20. This region is marked by the vertical
dashed-dotted line in Fig. 3. The optimum wavenumber
decreases with the cooling time for β . O(1) because
larger scales are more resistant to the associated increase
in viscous damping. This is evident from the dispersion
relation in the large wavenumber limit, Eq. 56, showing
increasing viscosity weakens small-scale modes.

Numerical simulations of gravito-turbulent disks show
there is a maximum α (∼ 0.06) that can be sustained
before fragmentation (Rice et al. 2005). We can inter-
pret this result in our linear framework. Suppose it is
possible to balance rapid cooling (β . 1) by generating
a large gravito-turbulent heating rate (α & 1) through
a small Q (second case in Eq. 59). Fig. 3 shows that
such a disk would be dynamically unstable with growth
rate s = O(Ω). This is due to the direct eﬀect of viscous
stress promoting instability, rather than cooling. Thus,
we do not expect rapidly-cooled, and hence highly tur-
bulent, self-gravitating disks to persist beyond dynami-
cal timescales. We might interpret fragmentation as an
instability of the highly viscous state (see §1.4). This
is consistent with previous numerical simulations per-
formed by Lodato & Rice (2005).

Figure 3. Growth rates (top) at the optimal wavenumber (bot-
tom) for viscous GI as a function of cooling time for the case shown
in the top panel of Fig. 2. Black curves computed from the disper-
sion relation (Eq. 45), and the orange curves are estimates based
on Eq. 55—56. The dashed line marks the region with α > 1,
and the dashed-dot line marks the region where growth timescales
exceed the dynamical time.

We conﬁrm the above results in 3D disks with verti-
cal structure. Accounting for the third dimension will
weaken gravitational instabilities because the disk mass
is spread across some vertical extent. It is possible to in-
corporate this eﬀect in the previous 2D framework, but
doing so introduces an additional ‘softening’ parameter
Hsg as discussed in Appendix C. It is more direct to solve
the 3D eigenvalue problem to avoid such uncertainties.
Our numerical approach is outlined in Appendix D.

In the following examples we consider a vertically
isothermal disk (Γ = 1 in Eq. 23). Then in the viscous
case α is vertically constant (Eq. 24). We consider only
even modes about the mid-plane, and apply a numerical
disk surface at z = zmax such that ρ(zmax) = 0.05ρ0.

5.1. Inviscid 3D disk

Fig.

We consider a 3D inviscid disk with γ = 1.4, Q3D =
0.71, and θ = 0. The 3D gravity parameter Q3D is de-
ﬁned by Eq. 41. For such a disk, the corresponding
Toomre parameter Q = 2Qcrit. Recall Qcrit, deﬁned by
Eq. 52, is the Toomre parameter value such that the 2D
disk would be marginally stable in the absence of cooling.
4 shows growth rates and the most unstable
wavenumbers obtained for this model. We also plot 2D
results with the 3D correction as described in Appendix
C. The (empirically) chosen value of Hsg = 0.64H re-
sults in a close match between 2D and 3D growth rates,
but the most unstable wavenumber in 3D is somewhat
smaller. This oﬀset reﬂects self-gravity being weakened
in the vertical direction: a larger horizontal scale is re-
quired to achieve the same strength of self-gravity as
the 2D case. Similarly, choosing Hsg = 0.53H matches
the optimum wavenumbers, but growth rates are over-
estimated in 2D.

5.2. Viscous 3D disk

For the 3D viscous problem we use the same set up as

that in 2D (§4.2), but with
Q3D =

Q3D,crit√α

,

where Q3D,crit ≃ 0.36 is the 3D equivalent to the 2D
critical value, Qcrit. Note that the background vertical
structure now varies with α through Eq. 60, which in
turn depends on the cooling time through thermal equi-
librium (Eq. 24).

Fig. 5 shows growth rates, maximized over k, as a
function of the cooling time β. We also plot 2D results
with 3D corrections. Softening the self-gravity in 2D cap-
tures the correct qualitative behavior of the full 3D case.
For β & 1 choosing Hsg = 0.8H produces a good match.
However, it is clear that a single, constant value of Hsg
cannot re-produce 3D growth rates for all β. This sug-
gests that the exact value of Hsg is problem-dependent,
although taking Hsg ∼ O(H) should give the correct 3D
growth rate within a factor of two.
Fig. 6 shows the magnitude of the vertical velocity
|δvz| scaled by the total horizontal velocity for β = 1, 10
and 100. Vertical speeds are sub-dominant at . 30%
of the total horizontal speeds. These vertical velocities
are associated with viscous GI, and should not be com-
pared with those associated with the underlying gravito-
turbulence (e.g. Shi & Chiang 2014). Vertical velocities
are formally neglected in our framework when deﬁning
the basic state (§2.2).

bility of PPDs. We consider the gravito-turbulent disk

R15). This 2D, Keplerian disk orbits a Solar mass star
and is deﬁned by the following parameters,

• ˙M , the global radial mass accretion rate;
• Q0, the value of the 2D Toomre parameter where

the disk is gravito-turbulent;

• Tirr, the irradiation temperature;
• αm, the dimensionless viscosity associated with
other sources of turbulence, such as magneto-
rotational
instabilities (MRI, see also §1.2 and
§7.2).

These properties serve as inputs for calculating thermal
equilibrium, and mass and angular momentum conserva-
tion. Together with an opacity law, they allow us to con-
struct a global disk model with surface density Σ(R) and
temperature T (R) where R is the global cylindrical ra-
dius from the star. (See R15, for details.) These proﬁles
give Q(R), required for input into our linear framework.
We derive other dimensionless parameters below.

Although our disk is global in extent, here we con-
sider the local stability at each radius. We are thus
neglecting any global instabilities (Adams et al. 1989;
Lodato & Rice 2005; Kratter et al. 2010) as well as any
evolution of the disk properties in response to GI.

where κd ∝ T b with b = 2. Eq. 63 accounts for cooling
in the optically-thin (τ ≪ 1) and optically-thick (τ ≫ 1)
regimes.
Note that Eq. 62 falls within our deﬁnition of a beta
cooling prescription, because it is an explicit function of
the thermodynamic states. However, we formulated the
linear problem with the standard beta cooling function
given by Eq. 22, which has a diﬀerent (less realistic)
dependence on disk temperature. In order to adapt the
existing framework to the above PPD cooling function,
we need to identify the equivalent β and θ parameters
that are required for the linearized equations (see §3.1).

represents a physical cooling time for the perturbations,
and is consistent with previous deﬁnitions within factors
of order unity (e.g. Kratter et al. 2010, their Eq. 2).

Eq. 70 shows that θ is related to the true irradiation

Thus for Tirr = 0 we have 5/6 < θ < 3/2 by considering
τ → 0, ∞. However, for T = Tirr we have θ = 1, as
expected intuitively.

With our new linearized cooling function in hand, from
the discussion in §4.1 and by applying Eq. 47, we con-
clude that without viscous eﬀects the disk is stable ev-

are both satisﬁed.

PPDs become irradiation-dominated at large dis-
tances from the star, where T → Tirr and θ →
1 (Chiang & Goldreich 1997; D’Alessio et al. 1997;
Kratter & Murray-Clay 2011). Then Eq. 71 relaxes to
γ, Q > 1 in the outer disk. The condition on γ is then
guaranteed. On the other hand, numerical simulations
of gravito-turbulence show that 1 . Q . 2 (Gammie
2001; Rice et al. 2011), and the second inequality is gen-
erally satisﬁed. Taken together, this suggests that in
the outer regions of a realistic PPD, cooling may not
be the primary cause for a secondary instability of a
gravito-turbulent disk, leading to fragmentation. This
leaves viscous GI as the only possible culprit within our
framework, as we illustrate below.

6.4. Example 2D calculation

We relax the inviscid assumption and consider a ﬁdu-
cial disk model with ˙M = 10−6M⊙ yr−1, Q0 = 1.5,
Tirr = 10K, and αm = 10−3. Such a high accretion rate
is consistent with those expected for young protostellar
disks (Shu 1977; Enoch et al. 2009). Similarly, 10K is
a conservatively low background irradiation level con-
sistent with cloud temperatures in star forming regions
(Plume et al. 1997; Johnstone et al. 2001). Stellar irra-
diation will typically elevate Tirr in addition to adding
a radial dependence (Kratter et al. 2008) We adopt the
opacity scale κd0 = 5 × 10−4cm2 g−1 K−2 as in R15. We
use γ = 1.6, approximately applicable to an ideal molec-
ular gas at low temperatures This choice of γ satisﬁes
the global inviscid stability condition (Eq. 71). Fig. 7
shows the equilibrium disk proﬁle in terms of Q, α, β,
and θ. These proﬁles serve as input to the 2D dispersion
relation (Eq. 45, Eq. A1—A5).

The most unstable wavelength is a few times the disk
thickness. So long as H ≪ R, this result is consistent
with our use of the local approximation. For our ﬁducial
disk, H/R ∼ 0.07 around R ∼ 100AU, and H/R < 0.25
throughout the disk. The increase in |K| from ∼ 10AU
to ∼ 20AU is due to the decrease in Q, while that from ∼
60AU to ∼ 100AU occurs as the disk transitions from the
optically-thick to optically-thin regime. The mismatch
between the numerical and analytic solutions at large
distances is expected since the above expressions assume
|K| ≪ 1. Nevertheless the analytic estimates reproduce
qualitatively correct behavior.
The ﬁducial disk is subject to viscous GI on dynam-
ical timescales (. 10 orbits) for R & 60AU. We note
this transition radius is also implied by Eq.

Kratter et al. (2010). Coincidentally, beyond this radius

tion for disk fragmentation (e.g. R15). Thus viscous GI

turbulence and fragmentation due to the removal of ro-
tational support by viscous (turbulent) stresses.

less likely than our ﬁducial case) because the instability
cannot develop on orbital timescales.

6.5. 3D PPD with radiative diﬀusion

We brieﬂy consider 3D PPDs with explicit radiative
diﬀusion (§2.2.2). Given the α(R) and Q(R) proﬁles
obtained from the 2D model above, at each radius R
we obtain the vertical structure from Eq. 19—21, with
Eq. 26—27 for the radiative ﬂux. We then solve the 3D
eigenvalue problem as in §5, with the additional bound-
ary condition that the disk surface temperature is ﬁxed,
δT (zmax) = 0. We use the ﬁducial disk model as in §6.4
but with Tirr = 0, since our simple radiative diﬀusion
treatment does not include irradiation (§2.2.2). We use
a slightly smaller vertical domain with ρ(zmax) = 0.1ρ0.

wavenumber for R ∈ [10, 100]AU; along with the corre-
sponding 2D results matched with softened self-gravity.
There is good agreement for R . 60AU where the disk
is optically thick (τ & 1) and thus both models ap-
ply. However, beyond 60AU where the disk becomes
optically-thin, radiative diﬀusion (the 3D curve) is not
valid and under-estimates the growth rates. Neverthe-
less, the transition radius of ∼ 60AU, beyond which
growth timescales become dynamical, can be correctly
calculated within the 2D framework.

7. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we develop the linear theory of cooling,
irradiated, and viscous accretion disks in order to under-
stand gravitational instability (GI) in realistic protoplan-
etary disks (PPDs). We use a Navier-Stokes viscosity to
mimic the eﬀects of turbulent angular momentum trans-
port. This viscosity provides a background heating to
balance the imposed cooling, and may also act on linear
perturbations. We suggest that disk fragmentation ob-
served in numerical simulations can be understood as the

eventual outcome of secondary instabilities of a gravito-
turbulent base state, driven by cooling and/or viscosity.
Previous work has focused on the impact of viscos-
ity and cooling on the equilibrium temperature and sur-
face density of an accretion disk, but merely used this to
calculate the classic Toomre Q, thereby assess stability.
We demonstrate by explicitly including these eﬀects into
the dispersion relation that they can drive secondary in-
stabilities. While viscosity and cooling can be related
through thermal balance, they independently enhance
growth rates: cooling reduces thermal stabilization; and
viscous forces compromise rotational stabilization. This
provides a physical explanation as to why rapidly-cooled,
gravito-turbulent disks cannot exist. Moreover, we dis-
cuss below how these models may lend support to the
varied behavior observed in numerical simulations.

The eﬀect of cooling and irradiation on GI is quanti-
ﬁed by the dispersion relation Eq. 46. We ﬁnd suﬃcient
conditions for stability which depends on the irradiation
level (Eq. 47) but is independent of the cooling time.
This means that long cooling times can still formally lead
to instability. However, growth timescales may be unin-
terestingly long for cooling times tcΩ & O(10). Because
cooling aﬀects pressure support, GI driven by cooling
occur on small scales, kH & O(1).

stability’,
(Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974; Willerding 1992; Gammie
1996),
to include cooling, viscous heating and ir-
radiation. We consider a disk with viscosity and
self-gravity inversely related (α ∝ Q−2) to model a
gravito-turbulent background, and ﬁnd viscous GI
occurs on orbital timescales for α & 0.1. This is
consistent with the notion of a maximum stress sus-
tainable by gravito-turbulence established by numerical
simulations (Rice et al. 2005). Because viscosity aﬀects
rotational support, viscous GI occurs on large scales,
kH . O(1). Furthermore,
irradiation preferentially
stabilizes small-scale perturbations.

We apply our linear framework to protoplanetary disks
with realistic models for cooling and gravito-turbulence.
We show that with a physically motivated cooling model
for PPDs, cooling alone does not lead to gravitational
instabilities. This is due to stabilization by an eﬀective
‘irradiation’ associated with the density-dependence of
the PPD cooling function as it appears in the stability
problem, which is present even if there is no physical
irradiation. This captures the fact that density enhance-
ments impede cooling.

Instead, viscous GI occur on dynamical timescales in
a PPD for R & 60AU because α & 0.1 there. This
corresponds to a Toomre Q ≃ 1.5 and a cooling time
tc . 3Ω−1. These are coincident with empirical condi-
tions cited in the literature to determine disk fragmen-
tation (e.g. Raﬁkov 2015). Here, we attribute a physical
cause for the fragmentation of realistic PPDs: gravito-
turbulent PPDs fragment when turbulent stresses are
large enough to further destabilize the disk against self-
gravity.

7.1. Relation to numerical simulations

Our results may help understand some numerical sim-
ulations concerning disk fragmentation. Table 1 shows a
close match between the characteristic cooling time for
cooling-driven GI (Eq. 54) and that for disk fragmenta-
tion observed in simulations (Gammie 2001; Rice et al.
2005, 2011). This suggests that, at least for those sim-
ulations, fragmentation is physically due to the removal
of thermal stabilization by cooling on radial lengthscales
of the disk thickness.
In this interpretation, gravito-
turbulence only provides a background heating. Our
characteristic cooling time corresponds to a dimension-
less background viscosity as deﬁned in the above studies6

(73)

This α ∼ 0.06 is roughly constant, consistent with
Rice et al. (2005).
More recent simulations have raised the issue of nu-
merical convergence. Meru & Bate (2011) found that
better resolved disks fragmented at longer cooling times.
Follow-up studies attributed at least some of this eﬀect
to decreasing numerical viscous heating at higher resolu-
tion, which helps fragmentation (Lodato & Clarke 2011;
Meru & Bate 2012). We can expect this if numerical

viscosity contributes to an eﬀective irradiation, because
then perturbations can cool to lower temperatures with
increasing resolution, see Fig. 1. In global simulations,
non-convergence has also been attributed to initial con-
ditions that lead to internal edges (Paardekooper et al.
2011), but this cannot be modeled in our local setup.
Rice et al. (2012) point out that the standard implemen-
tation of beta cooling in smoothed-particle hydrodynam-
ics (SPH) applies cooling on scales well-below the SPH
smoothing lengths, and that this inconsistency may con-
tribute to non-convergence.

However, Paardekooper (2012) also found in local 2D
grid-based simulations that fragmentation can occur for
slowly-cooled disks with tcΩ ≫ O(1), but that this re-
quires simulations to run for signiﬁcantly longer than dy-
namical timescales. This is consistent with our ﬁnding
that for either cooling-driven or viscous GI, there is no
critical cooling rate/viscosity below which the disk is for-
mally stable.
Instead, growth rates smoothly decrease
with increasing tc (decreasing α), implying that insta-
bilities, and hence fragmentation, simply take longer to
develop for slowly-cooled disks. However, to properly
consider long timescales, it may be necessary to account
for secular evolution in the global disk.

Here, we highlight that most numerical experiments,
including those above, employ the standard beta cool-
ing function, Eq. 22, without a physical ﬂoor temper-
ature. We show in §4.1 (see also §1.1) that this im-
plies cooling-driven GI can occur at any suﬃciently small
scale. Therefore as the numerical resolution increases,
simulations can access a wider range of unstable scales.
Although small-scale modes have weaker growth rates,
they can become important over long timescales.
In
this respect, it is perhaps not surprising to ﬁnd non-
convergence with increasing resolution and/or integra-
tion times. On the other hand, the convergence issue
may be less serious in 3D since small-scale modes are
more stable in 3D than in 2D (Appendix C).

We suggest having a physical ﬂoor temperature in the
standard beta cooling prescription is necessary for nu-
merical convergence. This limits the relevant scales to a
ﬁnite range. Furthermore, without a ﬂoor temperature,
standard beta cooling is a function of the pressure/energy
density ﬁeld only. There may be some inconsistency in
applying results obtained from this to actual PPDs where
cooling depends on two thermodynamic states (e.g. pres-
sure and temperature). A ﬂoor temperature permits a
mapping between standard beta cooling and PPD cooling
(§6.2). Moreover, the standard beta cooling does not ac-
count for optical depth eﬀects, which force the mid-plane
and high density perturbations to cool more slowly.

A temperature ﬂoor may be a necessary, but
not
suﬃcient condition for numerical convergence.
Baehr & Klahr (2015) included a ﬂoor temperature in
their local 2D simulations but still ﬁnd that at ﬁxed cool-
ing rates, disks eventually fragment with suﬃcient spatial
resolution. In light of our results on viscous GI, we sug-
gest another possible contribution to non-convergence:
high resolution enables small-scale turbulent angular mo-
mentum transport to aid clump formation via the re-
moval of rotational support. (See also §7.2 below.) If
clumps are only marginally resolved, simulations may
not have suﬃcient dynamic range for turbulent eddies
to cascade down to these scales.

We comment that although modern simulations resolve
the dominant scale associated with gravito-turbulence
very well, kH ∼ 1 (Cossins et al. 2009), this does not
necessarily imply small-scale dynamics/thermodynamics
are unimportant (especially for non-linear evolution,
Young & Clarke 2015), as is evident from the non-
converging simulations described above. Even at very
high resolution one might worry that the artiﬁcial dis-
sipation scale imposed by the grid/smoothing length is
too similar to the scale of fragmentation.

7.2. MHD turbulence

We emphasize that the linear framework we have devel-
oped does not assume a particular origin for the turbu-
lence that is represented by the imposed viscosity. For
example, our 2D dispersion relation, Eq. 45 with Eq.
A1—A5, treats α as an independent input parameter.

Our models may thus apply to self-gravitating disks
dominated by MHD turbulence. Explicit numerical sim-
ulations of magnetized, massive disks have been per-
formed by Fromang (2005). This study ﬁnds disk frag-
mentation with increasing numerical resolution, and at-
tributes this to resolving the most unstable MRI wave-
length, which enables small-scale angular momentum re-
moval by MHD turbulence to aid fragmentation. This
physical mechanism is represented by the viscous GI dis-
cussed in this paper, which lends some support for the
use of a viscosity to represent turbulence.

7.3. Outstanding issues

True disk fragmentation is a non-linear process char-
acterized by clumps reaching densities that are or-
ders of magnitude above the ambient value. They
must also survive disruption by tidal shear and shocks
(Shlosman & Begelman 1987; Young & Clarke 2016).
Clearly, our linear models cannot address fragmentation
directly. Technically, we have only demonstrated that
a gravito-turbulent state becomes dynamically unstable,
and thus should not persist, when cooling is too rapid or
when the associated viscous stresses are too large. How-
ever, steady gravito-turbulence or fragmentation are the
only possible outcomes of cooling, self-gravitating disks
in the local limit (Gammie 2001). Thus it seems rea-
sonable to speculate that the non-existence of a stable
gravito-turbulent state, here due to dynamical instabil-
ity, implies disk fragmentation.

tion,
fragmentation is attributed to the occurrence
and survival of large, non-linear density enhancements,
which arise from the gravito-turbulent ﬂuctuations
simply by chance. There is insuﬃcient evidence that
gravito-turbulence adequately samples
the density
power spectrum as assumed by Hopkins & Christiansen
(2013). Nevertheless, one might consider this form
of fragmentation as a secondary instability triggered
by lowering the local Toomre parameter through a
(random) increase in density.

The most important assumption in this work is mod-
eling turbulence as a Navier-Stokes viscosity. Further-
more, we have chosen a particular viscosity law (see §2.1)

support (in the sense that it provides small-scale angu-
lar momentum transport). How to quantitatively model
the eﬀect of gravito- or MHD turbulence as a viscosity,
especially on dynamical timescales, should be clariﬁed
with direct numerical simulations. The present viscosity
models should then be modiﬁed accordingly.

Another possible generalization is non-axisymmetric
disturbances.
inviscid disks non-
axisymmetric global GI can develop for Q somewhat
larger than unity (Papaloizou & Lin 1989; Adams et al.
1989; Papaloizou & Savonije 1991; Laughlin et al. 1997).

In barotropic,

It would be interesting to study how non-axisymmetric
perturbations are aﬀected by cooling and viscosity in or-
der to improve the link between disk fragmentation and
the stability of gravito-turbulent disks.

which agrees with the above studies in the isothermal limit (γ = 1; see also Schmit & Tscharnuter 1995, their Eq.

by reducing the gravitational constant

or equivalently Q → Q (1 + |k|Hsg). This prescription, derived by Shu (1984), is widely applied (e.g. Youdin 2011;
Takahashi & Inutsuka 2014). Here Hsg is a measure of the disk thickness. We intuitively expect Hsg ∼ H, but its
precise value is not known a priori. We regard Hsg as a free parameter of the problem.

and the potential satisﬁes

We discretize the equations, including upper disk boundary conditions, over the N positive abscissae of the extrema
of T2N −1. This procedure converts the diﬀerential equations into a generalized eigenvalue problem, for which we use
the standard matrix package LAPACK to solve. We use N = 65.
