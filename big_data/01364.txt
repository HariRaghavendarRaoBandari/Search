An optical realization of the damped quantum oscillator, based on transverse light dynamics in an optical
resonator with slowly-moving mirrors, is theoretically suggested. The optical resonator setting provides a simple
implementation of the time-dependent Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian of the dissipative quantum oscillator, and
enables to visualize the eﬀects of damped oscillations in the classical (ray optics) limit and wave packet collapse
in the quantum (wave optics) regime.

Quantum dissipation,

i.e. quantum mechanical de-
scription of the process of irreversible behavior observed
at the classical level, has received a great interest since
the earlier developments of quantum physics [1–3]. It
shares many features with the subjects of quantum de-
cay and quantum decoherence, and hence it is of ma-
jor importance in diﬀerent areas of physics. A paradig-
matic example of quantum dissipation is provided by the
damped quantum oscillator (DQO) [4, 5]. Two diﬀerent
approaches have been generally considered to describe
the DQO. In the ﬁrst approach [6–9] dissipation results
from microscopic reversible interaction between the os-
cillator and the environment. After elimination of the
reservoir degrees of freedom, an eﬀective equation of mo-
tion that includes a friction force can be obtained [3, 7].
The other approach incorporates the environment eﬀects
by considering an eﬀective time-dependent Hamiltonian
[4, 5]. Such an approach was introduced in two semi-
nal papers by Caldirola and Kanai [1, 2]. The Caldirola-
Kanai Hamiltonian belongs to the class of integrable
time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonians, which are of
relevance in several areas of physics ranging from quan-
tum optics to cosmology [10–13].
In recent years, optics has provided a useful laboratory
tool to emulate a wealth of physical phenomena rang-
ing from solid-state physics to relativistic quantum me-
chanics and relativity [14–21]. In particular, the use of
engineered photonic lattices has been suggested to emu-
late quantum decoherence, quantum decay and quantum
dissipation within the two above mentioned approaches
[22–25]. For example, light propagation in waveguide ar-
rays with non-nearest neighbor couplings has been shown
to map in Fock space the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian
[23], however special control of waveguide parameters are
needed, which is of hard implementation.

In this Letter we suggest an optical realization of the
Caldirola-Kanai DQO, which is based on transverse light
dynamics in an optical resonator with slowly-moving
cavity mirrors. The optical cavity setup allows one the
visualization of dissipative eﬀects both in the wave-optics
(quantum dissipation) and ray-optics (classical dissipa-
tion) regimes.

the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian reads [1, 2, 4, 5]

where g(t) = γt for constant friction with damping co-
eﬃcient γ. Other forms of g(t), corresponding to a non-
exponentially decaying oscillator, can be considered as
well [26]. As is well-known, the Caldirola-Kanai Hamil-
tonian is exactly integrable by means of the Lewis-
Riesenfeld invariant method or the quantum Arnold
transformation [4, 27]. Indicating by φ(X, T ) the solu-
tion to the Schr¨odinger equation for the free-particle, i.e.
i∂T φ = −(¯h2/2m)∂ 2
Xφ, the solution to Eq.(1) with the
initial condition ψ(x, 0) = φ(x, 0) reads explicitly [27]

one has u1(t) = (1/Ω) exp(−γt/2) sin(Ωt) and u2(t) =
exp(−γt/2) cos(Ωt)+[γ/(2Ω)] exp(−γt/2) sin(Ωt), where

Ω = pω2 − γ 2/4. Indicating by X(T ) = hφ|X|φi and

∆X(T ) = hφ|(X − X(T ))2|φi1/2 the mean position and
width of the free-particle wave packet φ(X, T ), from
Eq.(2) it readily follows that the mean position and
width of the DQO are given by x(t) = u2(t)X(u1/u2)
and ∆x(t) = u2(t)∆X(u1/u2). From such relations, the
following two main properties of the DQO can be stated:
(i) the mean position x(t) satisﬁes the classical equation
(3) of the damped oscillator, i.e. the semiclassical mo-
tion of the quantum wave packet reproduces the friction
of the classical damped oscillator; (ii) since u1(t)/u2(t) is

1

a limited function of time and u2(t) → 0 as t → ∞, one
has ∆x(t) → 0 as t → ∞, i.e. the wave packet undergoes
a quantum collapse in real space and full delocalization
in momentum space. In this work we aim to emulate the
Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian [Eq.(1)] in an optical res-
onator, highlighting the possibility of a direct visualiza-
tion of the two above-mentioned properties of the DQO,
namely friction motion in the classical (ray optics) limit
and wave packet collapse in the quantum (wave optics)
regime.

equation (1). In the ray-optics limit, damped harmonic os-
cillations can be observed by injection of a collimated laser
beam at one edge of the resonator, using a small adjustable
injection mirror (M), and looking at the beam spots on the
left plane mirror at successive bouncing in the cavity.

laser physics [28, 29]. Recent theoretical and experimen-
tal works have suggested their use to eﬀectively simu-
late the quantum mechanical Schr¨odinger equation in
rather extended forms [30–33], for example to emulate
a fractional kinetic energy operator [30, 32] or a gauge
(magnetic) ﬁeld [31, 33]. To mimic the Caldirola-Kanai
Hamiltonian, let us consider paraxial beam propagation
in a Fabry-Perot optical resonator with spherical optical
elements, described by a round-trip matrix ABCD with
respect to one of the two end mirrors [Fig.1(a)]. The res-
onator is assumed to be in its canonical form, i.e. with
ﬂat end mirrors, so that [29]

A = D = cos θ

(4)

where θ is real for stability. For the sake of clearness,
we consider one transverse spatial variable x, however

the analysis holds mutatis mutandis for a more realistic
spherical resonator with two-dimensional transverse co-
ordinates (x, y). Indicating by ψn(x) the transverse op-
tical ﬁeld distribution at the reference ﬂat end mirror
in the cavity, beam propagation at successive transits in
the cavity is described by the generalized Fresnel inte-
gral [28, 29]

where n is the round-trip number and λ is the optical
wavelength. For our purposes, it is worth writing Eq.(5)
as a stroboscopic map for an associated Schr¨odinger-like
wave equation. Using the decomposition ˆK = exp(−iH)
for the generalized Fresnel integral operator, where ˆH
is a second-order linear diﬀerential operator [34, 35],
the map (5) ψn+1 = exp(−i ˆH)ψn can be derived from
the Schr¨odinger equation i∂nψ(x, n) = ˆHψ(x, n), which
reads explicitly

where k = 2π/λ is the optical wave number and the
angle θ is deﬁned by Eq.(4). Let us now suppose that the
ABCD resonator matrix elements are slowly varied at
successive round trips, in such a way that A = D = cos θ
is kept constant whereas

B(n) = B(0) exp[−g(n)], C(n) = C(0) exp[g(n)]

(8)

where g(n) is a slowly-increasing function of n with
g(0) = 1. As discussed below, in practice this can be
simply achieved by slowly moving the end mirrors of
the resonator. After substitution of Eq.(8) into Eq.(7),
one readily recognizes that Eq.(7) is analogous to the
Caldirola-Kanai Schr¨odinger equation (1), provided that
the following formal substitutions are made

t → n , ω → θ

(9b)

Therefore, wave propagation inside the optical cavity at
successive round trips with slowly-varying elements B
and C emulates the Schr¨odingier equation (1) of the
DQO. For constant friction g(n) = γn, the requirement
that B and C vary slowly over one round trip time im-
plies γ ≪ 1. For a resonator well inside the stability do-
main, i.e. θ far from enough from zero, from Eq.(9a) one
has γ/ω ≪ 1, i.e. our optical system emulates the DQO
in the underdamped regime. To reach critical damping,
the resonator must operate close to the instability region

domain in panel (a) shows the path followed by (L1/f, L2/f )
as the round trip number increases from n = 0.

θ ≃ 0, which might be challenging in an experiment.
To obtain the slow changes of matrix elements B and
C as in Eq.(8), let us consider as an example the cavity
shown in Fig.1(b), which comprises two ﬂat end mirrors
and one focusing lens (focal length f ) placed at distances
L1 and L2 from the two mirrors. The stability region of
the resonator is depicted in Fig.2(a). A slow change of
parameters B and C can be obtained by slowly moving
the two end mirrors, i.e. by making the distances L1(n)
and L2(n) slowly varying with the round trip number n
with an initial condition L1(0) and L2(0) in the upper
stability domain of Fig.2(a). The behavior of L1(n) and
L2(n) that realizes the damping g(n) is obtained as a

As an example, Fig.2(b) shows the paths of L1 and L2
that realize an exponential damping g(n) = γn. Note
that, since θ does not change when L1 and L2 are var-
ied, the resonator remains inside the stability domain

[solid curve in Fig.2(a)].
The optical cavity setup enables in a simple way to vi-
sualize the two main eﬀects of the DQO, namely (i) the
damped oscillatory trajectory of the wave packet, and
(ii) its quantum collapse. To observe the damped mo-
tion of the oscillator, it is worth considering the ray op-
tics limit of beam propagation inside the resonator. In
the ray optics limit, damped harmonic oscillations sus-
tained by the optical cavity with slowly-moving mirrors
can be observed by injection of a collimated laser beam
(e.g. an He-Ne laser) at one edge of the resonator and
looking at the motion of beam spots on the left plane
mirror at successive round trips [Fig.1(b); see also the
setup discussed in Fig.15.16 of Ref. [28]). According to
paraxial ray matrix analysis, the ray displacement xn
and ray angle x′
n of the beam spot on the ﬂat mirror at
the n-th round trip satisfy the recurrence relation [29]

(16)
In our case A(n) = D(n) = cos θ is independent of n,
and for a constant friction, g(n) = γn, one has B(n +
1)/B(n) = exp(−γ). Hence from Eq.(16) one obtains

xn+1 − cos θ[1 + exp(−γ)]xn + exp(−γ)xn−1 = 0. (17)

1 + βµn
The solution to Eq.(17) is given by xn = αµn
2 ,
where µ1,2 are the roots of the algebraic equation µ2 −
cos θ[1 + exp(−γ)]µ + exp(−γ) = 0 and α, β are deter-
mined by the initial condition x0, x′
0. Note that |µ1,2| =
exp(−γ), and that µ1,2 ≃ exp(−γ ±iθ) for γ ≪ 1. There-
fore, as expected xn describes an exponentially-damped
oscillation with period 2π/θ and damping parameter γ.
An example of the behavior of xn for the moving cav-
ity mirror parameters of Fig.2 is shown in Fig.3(a). It
should be noted that in a realistic optical resonator with
two transverse spatial dimensions (x, y) the beam spots
at coordinates (xn, yn) are distributed along a general
elliptic curve in the transverse plane, i.e. they describe
Lissajous patterns typical of the two-dimensional har-
monic oscillator (see, for example, Ref. [28], p. 603).
In the cavity with mirrors at rest the Lissajous pat-
tern is stationary, whereas when the two mirrors are
synchronously moved following the laws (13) and (14)
the Lissajous pattern shrinks toward the optical axis
x = y = 0; see Fig.3(b). In an experiment, the maximum
damping rate γ (i.e. rate of Lissajous pattern shrink-
ing) that one can achieve is ultimately limited by the
ﬁnite speed at which mechanical mirrors can be moved.
To estimate realistic values of γ, let us calculate the
speed v of faster moving mirror, i.e. of mirror 2. From
Eq.(13) one has v = |dL2/dt| = (γ/TR)[L2(t)− f ], where

TR = (L1 + L2)/c is the round-trip transit of photons in
the resonator and t = nTR. Taking L1 ≃ f and L2 ≫ f ,
which holds after some transient at initial round trips
[see solid curve in Fig.2(a)], one has v ≃ γc. Values of v
achievable with motorized linear stage guides with travel
up to ∼ 1m are v ∼ 300 − 1000 mm/s, which yields
γ ∼ v/c ∼ 10−8−10−9. At such small damping rates, the
dynamics in the resonator is fully adiabatic, so that in
an experiment one can simply record Lissajous patterns
at ﬁxed mirror positions and then move them following
the laws (13) and (14).

The ray optics analysis and Lissajous patterns dis-
cussed above capture the classical limit of the DQO, i.e.
damped classical oscillator dynamics. Genuine quantum
eﬀects of the DQO with no classical counterpart, which
have been studied in previous works, can be emulated by
considering wave-optics dynamics in the resonator. Such
eﬀects include existence of pseudo-stationary states in
the underdamped regime [5], dissipation-induced tran-
sitions [36] and wave packet spreading suppression by
dissipation [37]. Interestingly, pseudo-stationary states
correspond to a rest particle but with a wave function
that eventually undergoes a wave collapse. Wave collapse
can be visualized by considering an active cavity, i.e. a
laser oscillator with the optical resonator of Fig.1(b).
The laser is operated above threshold in continuous-wave
mode and transverse mode selection in the fundamental
TEM00 mode is accomplished by e.g. longitudinal pump-

4

ing [29]. The transverse distribution of the output laser
beam can be monitored on a CCD camera at ﬁxed mir-
ror positions, and then moving the mirrors as discussed
above. When the ﬂat end mirrors of the resonator are
slowly moved, the beam spot size w1(n) at the output
left mirror undergoes adiabatic changes according to the
relation

2(n) + θ2u2

w1(n) = w1(0)qu2

1(n) ≃ w1(0) exp(−γn/2)
(18)
where w1(0) = (λ/π)1/2[−B(0)/C(0)]1/4 is the spot size
of the initial TEM00 mode. The shrinking of the beam
spot size at successive round trips, w1(n) → 0 as n → ∞,
is a clear signature of wave packet collapse. In our optical
setup, wave packet collapse arises because the resonator
stability region shrinks as L2/f → ∞ and L1/f → 1+,
i.e. a stability boundary is reached even though the angle
θ does not change [see the solid curve in Fig.2(a)]. In such
a limit, the ﬂat mirror at the left side of the resonator
gets close to the focal lens plane, whereas the other one is
its Fourier-conjugate plane. While the spot size w1(n) on
the left mirror shrinks as n increases, the corresponding
beam spot size w2(n) on the right ﬂat mirror enlarges; see
Fig.3(c). Interestingly, the product w1w2 is independent
of n and reads

w1(n)w2(n) =

λf

π r 1 − cos θ

(19)

which emulates the position-momentum uncertainty re-
lation.

In conclusion, we suggested a simple optical realiza-
tion of the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian describing a
damped quantum harmonic oscillator, which is based
on the transverse ray and wave dynamics of light in an
optical cavity with slowly-moving mirrors. As compared
to recent proposals of Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonians
using specially-tailored photonic lattices with non-
nearest neighbor couplings and longitudinal waveguide
modulation [23,24], the optical resonator setup proposed
in this work enables a much simpler implementation as
well as a direct visualization of wave packet dynamics,
such as damped Lissajous trajectories and wave packet
collapse. Our results also indicate that transverse light
dynamics in optical resonators with moving mirrors
provides an accessible testbed for emulating in optics
quadratic time-dependent Hamiltonians, and thus it can
be of potential interest for the simulation on a tabletop
of other physical phenomena or exotic theoretical
models based on time-dependent quadratic Hamil-
tonians, such as the behavior of gravitational waves
in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime [13, 38]
or gravitational decoherence in non-linear dispersion
cosmological models [39].
