LOCAL ANALOGS FOR HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXIES: RESEMBLING THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF

THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM IN HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXIES.

Fuyan Bian1,4, Lisa J. Kewley1, Michael A. Dopita1,2, Stephanie Juneau3

ABSTRACT

We present a sample of local analogs for high-redshift galaxies selected in the Sloan Digital Sky Sur-
vey (SDSS). The physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) in these local analogs resemble
those in high-redshift galaxies. These galaxies are selected based on their positions in the [O III]/Hβ
versus [N II]/Hα nebular emission-line diagnostic diagram. We show that these local analogs share
similar physical properties with high-redshift galaxies, including high speciﬁc star formation rates
(sSFRs), ﬂat UV continuums and compact galaxy sizes. In particular, the ionization parameters and
electron densities in these analogs are comparable to those in z ≃ 2 − 3 galaxies, but higher than
those in normal SDSS galaxies by ≃0.6 dex and ≃0.9 dex, respectively. The mass-metallicity relation
(MZR) in these local analogs shows −0.2 dex oﬀset from that in SDSS star-forming galaxies at the low
mass end, which is consistent with the MZR of the z ∼ 2 − 3 galaxies. We compare the local analogs
in this study with those in other studies, including Lyman break analogs (LBA) and green pea (GP)
galaxies. The analogs in this study share a similar star formation surface density with LBAs, but the
ionization parameters and electron densities in our analogs are higher than those in LBAs by factors of
1.5 and 3, respectively. The analogs in this study have comparable ionization parameter and electron
density to the GP galaxies, but our method can select galaxies in a wider redshift range. We ﬁnd
the high sSFR and SFR surface density can increase the electron density and ionization parameters,
but still cannot fully explain the diﬀerence in ISM condition between nearby galaxies and the local
analogs/high-redshift galaxies.

1. INTRODUCTION

In the last decade, our knowledge of high-redshift
galaxies has improved tremendously by studying a
large sample of star-forming galaxies beyond z ∼
1 (e.g., Steidel et al. 2003, 2004; Franx et al. 2003;
Daddi et al. 2004, 2005; Bouwens et al. 2007; Hu et al.
2010; Stark et al. 2010).
Studies on these high-
redshift galaxies have suggested that high-redshift
star-forming galaxies have diﬀerent properties com-
pared to local star-forming galaxies.
High-redshift
star-forming galaxies are characterized by higher spe-
ciﬁc SFRs by about 1 dex (sSFR=SFRs/M∗, e.g.,
Daddi et al. 2007; Gonz´alez et al. 2010; Reddy et al.
2012; Stark et al. 2013), smaller galaxy sizes by 0.3-
0.5 dex (e.g., Ferguson et al. 2004; Trujillo et al. 2006;
Franx et al. 2008; Mosleh et al. 2012; van der Wel et al.
2014), higher gas
fractions by a factor of ∼ 5
(e.g., Daddi et al. 2010; Tacconi et al. 2010; Genzel et al.
2010, 2013; Tacconi et al. 2013; Saintonge et al. 2013),
and clumpy thick star-forming disks with higher veloc-
ity dispersion (e.g., F¨orster Schreiber et al. 2009, 2011;
Genzel et al. 2011; Newman et al. 2013).

Studies also suggest that the interstellar medium
(ISM) conditions in high-redshift galaxies are diﬀer-
ent from those in nearby galaxies. Observationally,
there exists an oﬀset between the high-redshift star-

(e.g., Liu et al.
2008; Brinchmann et al. 2008b; Overzier et al. 2008,
2009; Hainline et al. 2009; Bian et al. 2010; Steidel et al.
2014). Recently, Steidel et al. (2014) have found a well-
deﬁned high-redshift locus in the BPT diagram with a
large sample (126) of z ≃ 2.3 UV-selected star-forming
galaxies for the ﬁrst time. A number of studies have
suggested that the oﬀset between the high-redshift and
local BPT locus could be due to higher ionization pa-
rameters, harder ionization radiation ﬁelds, various N/O
ratios, AGN/shock contributions, and/or selection ef-
fects (e.g., Kewley et al. 2013a,b; Juneau et al. 2014;
Masters et al. 2014; Newman et al. 2014; Steidel et al.
2014; Shapley et al. 2015).

The dramatic change in ISM conditions between low-
redshift and high-redshift galaxies raises the following
crucial question. What are the major causes of the
change in ISM conditions? Are the local empirical metal-
licity calibrations based on strong emission-line diagnos-
tics and Te-based metallicities still applicable to high-
redshift star-forming galaxies? Unfortunately, it is dif-
ﬁcult to fully probe the ISM condition of high-redshift
galaxies due to their low surface brightness and small
angular size. An alternative method to approach this
problem is to select a sample of local analogs whose ISM
properties mimic those in high-redshift galaxies. Using
these local analogs, we can better understand the ISM
conditions in high-redshift galaxies and guide the metal-
licity calibrations in high-redshift galaxies.

A variety of methods have been developed to select

2

local analogs for high-redshift galaxies. Most of the
methods are based on the global properties of galax-
ies, such as their far-UV (FUV) surface luminosity
(e.g., Lyman break analogs (LBA) Heckman et al. 2005;
Hoopes et al. 2007; Stanway & Davies 2014), Hα lu-
minosity (e.g., Green et al. 2014), or extremely strong
[O III]λ5007 emission of the equivalent width (EW) up to
1000 ˚A (e.g., green pea galaxies, Cardamone et al. 2009),
or both Hα and [O III] luminosities (e.g., Juneau et al.
2014). These galaxies share many similar physical prop-
erties with high-redshift star-forming galaxies, includ-
ing the properties of metallicity, dust extinction, mor-
phology, outﬂow, kinematics, and molecular gas (e.g.,
Basu-Zych et al. 2007, 2009; Overzier et al. 2008, 2009,
2010, 2011; Gon¸calves et al. 2010, 2014; Heckman et al.
2011; Green et al. 2014; Bassett et al. 2014; Fisher et al.
2014). On the other hand, Shirazi et al. (2014) pointed
out that the low-redshift galaxies with similar global
properties, e.g., stellar mass, SFR, and sSFR, do not
necessarily to reproduce the similar ISM conditions in
high-redshift galaxies.

It is therefore essential to select a sample of local ana-
log galaxies that share the same ISM conditions as high-
redshift star-forming galaxies. This type of local analog
for high-redshift galaxies could provide us with better un-
derstanding of the cause of the diﬀerent ISM conditions
and allow us to improve the metallicity measurements in
high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Steidel et al. (2014)
suggested that the so-called ’green pea’ (GP) galaxies,
which are also known as ’isolated extragalactic HII region
galaxies’ (Sargent & Searle 1970), are probably good lo-
cal analogs for high-redshift galaxies in terms of ISM
conditions, and they are located in the high-redshift
star-forming locus in the BPT diagram. The GP galax-
ies are selected based on their distinctive colors due to
the very strong optical emission lines (EW0 > 100 ˚A,
Cardamone et al. 2009). In this study, we select galaxies
that are located in the high-redshift BPT locus as de-
ﬁned in Steidel et al. (2014) without applying any prior
selections on the emission line strength. We demonstrate
that the galaxies selected by our method share the same
properties, especially the physical conditions of the ISM,
as star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 − 3. Therefore, this
type of analog could provide us with a local laboratory
to study the cause of extreme star formation and ISM
condition in the high-redshift galaxies.
The paper is organized as follows.

In section 2, we
describe the selection method of local analogs for high-
redshift galaxies.
In Section 3, we compare the prop-
erties in the local analogs with those in both nearby
SDSS and high-redshift star-forming galaxies.
In Sec-
tion 4, we compare the local analogs in this study with
those in other studies, including the LBAs, GP galaxies
and SDSS galaxies with high line luminosities. In Sec-
tion 5, we discuss whether or not the high sSFR and
SFR surface density can fully explain the ISM evolution
from normal nearby star-forming galaxies to the local
analogs and high-redshift galaxies. Throughout the pa-
per, we use the value of the SFR and stellar mass based
on the Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF). The
SFRs and stellar masses derived from a Salpeter (1955)
or a Kroupa (2001) IMF were normalized to the Chabrier
IMF, by multiplying the results by 0.55 or 0.89, respec-

tively. We use the following cosmological parameters for
calculations: Hubble constant, H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1;
dark matter density, ΩM = 0.30; dark energy density,
and ΩM = 0.70 for a ﬂat Universe (e.g., Spergel et al.
2007).

analogs selected in study.

2. THE SELECTION OF LOCAL ANALOGS FOR

HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXIES

We select our local analogs from a sample of nearby
galaxies (z < 0.35) observed by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (York et al. 2000, SDSS;) by using the MPA-
JHU value added catalog for SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7,
Abazajian et al. 2009). This catalog includes 819,333
unique galaxies and provides information on the ﬂux,
EW, and line width of the rest-frame optical nebular
emission lines (e.g., [O II]λ3727, Hβ, [O III]λλ4959, 5007,
Hα, [NII]λ6583, and [S II]λλ6717, 6731), stellar masses
(M∗, Kauﬀmann et al. 2003),
formation rates
(SFRs, Brinchmann et al. 2004), and speciﬁc SFRs
(SFR/M∗, sSFRs, Brinchmann et al. 2004).
In this
study, we will adopt the emission-line and SFR mea-
surements from the MPA-JHU catalogs, and measure the
stellar mass with our own procedures; see details in sec-
tion 2.2.

2.1. Selection Criteria

Brinchmann et al. (2008b) and Liu et al. (2008) inves-
tigated the relation between the ISM conditions and
their locations in the BPT diagram, and found that local
galaxies with high EW(Hα) and high electron density lie
well above the ridge line of the star-forming locus in the
BPT diagram. In this work, we will use the well-deﬁned
high-redshift star-forming sequence in the BPT diagram
in Steidel et al. (2014) as a guide to deﬁne a selection
region for local analogs in the BPT diagram.

We select the local analogs for high-redshift galaxies
as follows: (1) We select the objects that are classiﬁed

Local Analogs

as star-forming/starburst galaxies in the MPA/JHU cat-
alog, in which Kewley et al. (2001) criteria were used to
separate the star-forming/starburst galaxies from AGNs;
(2) We select galaxies with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of
[O II]λ3727, Hβ, [O III]λλ4959, 5007, Hα and [N II]λ6583
emission lines greater than 10; (3) We apply the follow-
ing criteria to select galaxies that shares the similar BPT
locations of high-redshift star-forming galaxies:

Figure 1 shows the selection region of local analogs for
high-redshift galaxies bounded by the black solid lines.
The region between the two red lines represents the high-
redshift star-forming locus in the BPT diagram from
Steidel et al. (2014). The bottom boundary of the se-
lection criteria (equation 1) is about 0.2 dex higher
than that in the high-redshift locus to reduce contam-
inations from the normal nearby star-forming galaxies.
We adopt the top boundary (equation 2) from equation
5 in Kewley et al. (2001), which is deﬁned as the maxi-
mum starburst model. The right boundary (equation 3)
is used to reduce the contamination from AGN, and
this criterion also tends to select low-metallicity galax-
ies. The selection criteria overlap with the high-redshift
star-forming BPT locus and are well separated from the
local BPT locus as well as the well-known AGN regions
to reduce contamination. (4) We visually inspected the
images of these galaxies and their ﬁber positions to re-
move spurious galaxies being targeted due to poor pho-
tometric deblending (Andrews & Martini 2013). A total
of 252 galaxies satisfy the above selection criteria (blue
ﬁlled circles in Figure 1). The redshift distribution of
the galaxies is z = 0.05 − 0.35 with a median redshift of
z = 0.1. In this redshift range, the galaxy angular size is
small enough so that the ﬁber aperture eﬀects are neg-
ligible (Kewley et al. 2005). Though we apply this con-
servative selection to galaxies with high S/N (S/N>10)
spectra, there may exist a fraction of contaminants (see
details in section 3.1)

2.2. Stellar Mass

The stellar mass measurement in the MPA-JHU cat-
alog does not take into account the emission-line con-
tribution to the broadband photometry. This approach
is suitable for the majority of the SDSS galaxies whose
emission-line equivalent widths (EWs) are < 100˚A. How-
ever, a large fraction (> 10%) of the broadband ﬂux can
come from the emission lines for galaxies with strong
emission lines (EW> 100˚A). In this case, one would over-
estimate the stellar mass from ﬁtting the broadband pho-
tometry, if the emission line contribution is not carefully
removed. The local analogs selected in this work usu-
ally show strong [O III]λλ4959,5007 and Hα lines with
EW> 100˚A. Therefore, we independently derive the stel-
lar mass rather than adopting the stellar mass estimates
from MPA-JHU catalog.

We apply the IDL-based code Fitting and Assessment
of Synthetic Templates (FAST, Kriek et al. 2009) to de-
rive the stellar mass by ﬁtting broadband photometry.
The stellar mass is calculated from the best-ﬁt stellar
synthesis model and the stellar mass uncertainty is de-
rived using Monte Carlo simulations (Kriek et al. 2009).
Prior to the ﬁtting, we correct the broadband photome-
try for contributions from Hα, Hβ, and [O III] emission
lines using the line EWs and redshift from the MPA-JHU
catalog. We adopt the Bruzual & Charlot (2003, BC03)
stellar synthesis models with a Chabrier (2003) IMF. We
assume galaxies with exponentially decreasing star for-
mation history (SFR ∝ e−(t/τ )) with log(τ (yr)) = 7, 8,
9, 10, and 11 and a stellar population age in the range
0 − 13 Gyr. A smaller τ value corresponds to a more
bursty star-formation history, and a larger τ value cor-
responds to a more steady star-formation history. We
apply the dust extinction law proposed by Calzetti et al.
(2000) with E(B−V ) = 0−0.6. To investigate the contri-
bution of the emission lines to the stellar mass measure-
ment, we also carry out the SED ﬁtting on the broad
band photometry without correcting the emission line
contribution, and we ﬁnd that the broad band contribu-
tion to the stellar mass estimation is small (< 0.05 dex)
for majority of the SDSS galaxies. However, we will over-
estimate the stellar mass in the local analogs by a median
of 0.25 dex, if we do not remove the strong emission line
contributions in the local analogs.

3. PROPERTIES OF THE LOCAL ANALOGS FOR

HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXIES
In this section, we study the properties,

including
sSFR, size-mass relations, UV-continuum slope, dust at-
tenuation properties, electron densities, and ionization
parameters, of the local analogs for high-redshift galax-
ies. We compare these properties with those in normal
SDSS galaxies and high-redshift galaxies to demonstrate
that our local analogs share similar properties with high-
redshift galaxies.

3.1. Speciﬁc Star Formation Rate

We measure the SFR, stellar mass, and sSFR in the
local analogs for high-redshift galaxies. Figure 2 shows
the normalized distribution of the SFR, stellar mass, and
sSFR of the local analogs (the blue histogram) and the
SDSS galaxies (the red histogram). The blue and red
dashed lines represent the median SFR, stellar mass,
and sSFR of the local analogs and the local SDSS star-
forming galaxies, respectively. The median SFR, stellar
mass, and sSFR of the local analogs are 3.6 M⊙ yr−1,
9 × 108 M⊙, and 7 Gyr−1, respectively.

We compare the sSFRs in the local analogs with

that the sSFRs of z ∼ 2 − 3 star-forming galax-
ies are typically an order of magnitude higher than
those in nearby star-forming galaxies (Noeske et al. 2007;
Daddi et al. 2007; Wuyts et al. 2011; Rodighiero et al.
2011; Reddy et al. 2012; Salmi et al. 2012; Tacconi et al.
2013). Reddy et al. (2012) found that the median sSFR
of z ∼ 2 − 3 UV-selected galaxies is 2.4 Gyr−1 based on
the SFRs derived from the UV+24µm luminosities. This
result is consistent with those found in active BzK galax-
ies with both the UV+24µm-based SFRs (Daddi et al.

2007) and the FIR-based SFRs (Rodighiero et al. 2011).
Our local analogs have an even higher median sSFR com-
pared to star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 − 3 by a fac-
tor of 3. Rodighiero et al. (2011) found that the sSFR
becomes higher in the galaxies with lower stellar mass.
The median stellar mass in our local analogs is about
10 times lower than that in the high-redshift galaxies in
Reddy et al. (2012). We apply the relation between the
SFR and stellar mass found in Rodighiero et al. (2011)
and ﬁnd that the sSFR of high-redshift galaxies with stel-
lar masses of 9 × 108 M⊙ is 5 Gyr−1 (purple dashed line
in Figure 2). The sSFR of local analogs for high-redshift
galaxies is consistent with that of star-forming galaxies
at z ∼ 2 − 3 with similar stellar mass.

It is worth noting that there exits an extended low
sSFR tail down to log[sSFR (yr−1)] = -11.0, suggesting
that there may exist some contaminants in our selection.

3.2. Galaxy size-mass relation

The relation between galaxy size and stellar mass has
been established in both low- and high-redshift galax-
ies. Studies have found that high-redshift galaxies have
smaller sizes compared to local galaxies with similar
masses (e.g., Trujillo et al. 2006; Franx et al. 2008;
Mosleh et al. 2012). We compare the mass-size relation

in the local analogs with those in both local star-forming
galaxies and z = 2−3 star-forming galaxies. We adopted
the mass-size relation in the local star-forming galax-
ies established by Shen et al. (2003). The authors used
the S´ersic half-light radius in the SDSS r-band images
from (Blanton et al. 2003) to represent the galaxy size,
and they adopted stellar masses derived using the spec-
tra features, Dn(4000) & HδA (Kauﬀmann et al. 2003),
which is consistent with those derived from the broad-
band SED ﬁtting.5. Mosleh et al. (2011) used a sam-
ple of UV-selected galaxies (BX/BM galaxies at z ∼ 2
and LBGs at z ∼ 3) to study the size-mass relation at
z ∼ 2 and z ∼ 3. The galaxy sizes are measured in the
deep SUBARU Ks-band images, and the stellar mass
is derived from the SED ﬁtting. We scale the stellar
masses in Shen et al. (2003) and Mosleh et al. (2011),
which were derived based on a Kroupa (2001) IMF, to
the stellar masses based on a Chabrier (2003) IMF. For
the local analogs, we use the size measurements from
Blanton et al. (2003) and the stellar mass from SED ﬁt-
ting describe in section 2.2. Figure 3 shows the mass-size
relation in the local analogs, the z ∼ 2 − 3 star-forming
galaxies, and the SDSS star-forming galaxies. We ﬁnd
that the local analogs have more compact galaxy sizes
than SDSS star-forming galaxies for a ﬁxed stellar mass.
The mass-size relation in local analogs is consistent with
those in star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 and z ∼ 3. This
result suggests that the local analogs have similar stellar
mass surface densities to high-redshift galaxies. Consid-
ering that the sSFRs of local analogs are comparable to
those of high-redshift galaxies, this relation also suggests
that the the local analogs and high-redshift galaxies have
similar SFR surface densities.

analogs for high-redshift galaxies. The blue and purple dashed
lines represent the median values of the UV-continuum slope in the
local analogs and L∗ star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 (Bouwens et al.
2009).

3.3. UV-continuum Slope

We investigate the UV-continuum slope in our local
analogs for high-redshift galaxies. The rest-frame UV
continuum of galaxies can be described as a power law,
fλ ∝ λβ. A galaxy with β = −2 corresponds to a ﬂat
spectrum in fν, and the dust extinction leads to an in-
crease of β. Thus, the UV-continuum slope can be used
to approximate the dust obscuration in galaxies (e.g.
Meurer et al. 1999). The average UV spectral slope, hβi,
in local starburst is around -1.3, and hβi is smaller (UV
color bluer) at high-redshifts and lower UV luminosities
(e.g., Meurer et al. 1999; Bouwens et al. 2009, 2012).

We measure the UV-continuum slope (β) in the local
analogs for high-redshift galaxies using the Galaxy Evo-
lution Explorer (GALEX) FUV and NUV ﬂuxes. We
cross correlate the positions of the local analogs selected
in this study with the sources cataloged in GALEX-DR5
(Bianchi et al. 2011). A total of 152 local analogs are
detected by GALEX with 3σ in both the FUV and NUV
bands. The FUV and NUV bands provide the ﬂux at
a rest-frame ∼ 1400 ˚A and ∼ 2200 ˚A for the galaxies
at z = 0. At a redshift of z > 0.1, the Lyα emission
feature starts to shift into the FUV band and aﬀects the
UV-continuum slope measurement. Shapley et al. (2003)
found that the total rest-frame equivalent width of the
Lyα emission feature is 14.3 ˚A in the composite rest-
frame UV spectrum of a sample of Lyman break galaxies
(LBGs) at z ∼ 3. If we assume that our local analogs
have similar Lyα emission strength, then the inﬂuence
of the Lyα emission on the UV-continuum slope mea-
surement is negligible (∆β < 0.04). We compute the
UV-continuum slope, β, for the local analogs based on
the FUV and NUV magnitudes as follows: (1) we gener-
ate a series of spectral templates with −3 < β < 3 with
an increment of 0.01; (2) we convolve the spectral tem-
plates with the GALEX FUV and NUV band ﬁlter curves
and compute the FUV and NUV band color (magFUV −
magNUV) for the spectral template with a given β; (3)
we establish the relation between the β and FUV−NUV
color and ﬁt the relation with a quadratic equation,

β = −2.00 + 2.32 × (magFUV − magNUV) − 0.047 ×
(magFUV − magNUV)2; (4) we correct the GALEX mag-
nitudes for Galactic extinction (Schlegel et al. 1998); and
(5) we estimate the values of β and the uncertainties in
the local analogs based on the magFUV − magNUV color.
The typical errors in β are ∼ 0.51. We calculate the
weighted mean value for the UV slope using the inverse-
variance weighting method and ﬁnd that the weighted
mean of β is −1.51 ± 0.03 in the local analogs.

Figure 4 shows the distribution of the β for our lo-
cal analogs and high-redshift galaxies. The blue dashed
line represents the weighted mean of the UV slope for
local analogs. This value is comparable to the mean
UV-continuum slope, β, in L∗ star-forming galaxies at
z ∼ 2 − 3 (Bouwens et al. 2009, purple dashed line in
Figure 4). We also derive their UV absolute magni-
tude, M1400, which is in the range between -14 and -
22, with a median value of -19.8, based on their FUV
magnitudes and redshifts. This value is 1.6-2 magnitude
fainter than for L∗ star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 − 3
(e.g., Reddy & Steidel 2009; Bian et al. 2013). The UV-
continuum slope decreases with decreasing UV luminos-
ity. Therefore, the UV continuum in the analogs is likely
to be redder than that in the z ∼ 2 − 3 star-forming
galaxies with similar UV luminosity.

frared and UV luminosity versus UV-continuum slope, β, in the
local analogs for high-redshift galaxies. The large red circles rep-
resents the weighted mean value of dust attenuation and UV-
continuum slope. The black curve represents the relation derived
form the local star-forming galaxies (Meurer et al. 1999), which are
also followed by typical star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 − 3. The
black error bar represents the typical error of the dust attenuation
and UV-continuum slope measurements in the individual galaxy.

3.4. Dust Attenuation Properties

We investigate the relation between the dust attenu-
ation and the UV-continuum slope in the local analogs
for high-redshift galaxies and compare the relation with
those in local star-forming galaxies and typical (L∗) star-
forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 − 3. Studies have shown
a relation between the dust attenuation, measured by

6

F. Bian et al.

the FIR-to-UV luminosity ratio (LFIR/LUV), and the
UV-continuum slope (β) in local star-forming galax-
ies (Meurer relation, the solid line in Figure 5, e.g.,
Meurer et al. 1999). Galaxies with larger dust attenu-
ations tend to have a redder β than those with smaller
dust attenuations. Reddy et al. (2010) found that typ-
ical (L∗) star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 − 3 also follow
the Meurer relation. However, ultra-luminous infrared
galaxies (ULIRGs) and sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs)
with LFIR > 1012 L⊙ have larger LFIR/LUV than that in-
ferred from the Meurer relation due to the fact that their
UV emission has been highly obscured by dust, and thus
the UV-continuum slope does not represent the dust at-
tenuation of the whole galaxy (e.g., Papovich et al. 2006;
Howell et al. 2010; Penner et al. 2012).

We measure the FIR luminosity of the local analogs
using the Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE;
Wright et al. 2010) 12µm-band ﬂux. We cross-correlate
the positions of local analogs with the WISE DR4 cata-
log. A total of 196 out of 252 galaxies are detected at 3σ
in the WISE 12µm band, and 50 of the galaxies have UV-
continuum slope measurements in section 3.3. We con-
vert the WISE 12µm band luminosities to FIR luminosi-
ties by adopting the relation between the WISE 12µm
luminosity and the SFR (Lee et al. 2013) and the rela-
tion between the FIR luminosity and the SFR (Kennicutt
1998). We derive the UV luminosities with the GALEX
FUV magnitudes, which have been corrected for Galac-
tic dust extinction. Figure 5 shows the dust attenuation
(LFIR/LUV) versus the UV-continuum slope (β) of the
local analogs (black ﬁlled circles). We also derived the
weighted mean value for LFIR/LUV and β (red ﬁlled cir-
cle), which lies on the Meurer relation. Therefore, the
local analogs share the same dust attenuation properties
with normal star-forming galaxies rather than the highly
dust obscured ULIRGs.

3.5. Electron Density

We compare the electron densities in the local analogs
with those in local star-forming galaxies and high-
redshift galaxies. High-redshift galaxies often have
higher electron densities compared to nearby galaxies.
The typical electron densities in nearby star-forming
galaxies are less than 100 cm−3 (e.g, Zaritsky et al.
1994). A number of studies have suggested that the
electron densities in z ∼ 2 − 3 galaxies can be as
high as ne ≃ 1000 cm−3 based on [S II]λλ6717, 6731,
[O II]λλ3726, 3729, or C III]λλ1907, 1909 doublet ratios
(e.g., Hainline et al. 2009; Quider et al. 2009; Bian et al.
2010; Steidel et al. 2014).

the distributions of [S II]λ6717/[S II]λ6731 in the SDSS
galaxies (red histogram) and the local analogs (blue his-
togram). The [S II]λ6717/[S II]λ6731 ratios for a large
fraction (∼ 30%) of the SDSS galaxies are above the
maximum ratio value of 1.43 in the theoretical models,
suggesting a low electron density in these galaxies. We
assume that the electron density is 1 cm−3 in these galax-
ies. There is an oﬀset between the two [S II] doublet ra-
tio distributions with a median [S II] ratio of 1.40 in the
local SDSS star-forming galaxies and 1.24 in the local
analogs. The lower [S II] ratio indicates higher electron

densities in the analog galaxies. We measured the elec-
tron density (ne) using the nebular.temden routine in
IRAF(Shaw & Dufour 1995). The bottom panel of Fig-
ure 6 shows the distribution of the electron densities in
the SDSS galaxies (red histogram) and the local analogs
(blue histogram). The median electron density in our lo-
cal analogs is about 200 cm−3, which is about an order
magnitude higher than than in local star-forming galax-
ies, and about 10% of the local analogs have the electron
densities greater than ne = 500 cm−3.

We compare the electron densities in our analogs with
those in a sample of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2.3
in the MOSDEF survey ?. They found that the median
electron density at z ∼ 2.3 is about 250 cm−3, which is an
order of magnitude higher than that in nearby galaxies.
This median electron density is about 50 cm−3 higher
than that in our local analogs. In section 5, we ﬁnd that
there is an anti-correlation between the electron density
and sSFR (see ﬁgure 11). Therefore, the slightly lower
electron density in our analogs could be due to the higher
sSFRs in our analogs (see section 3.1).

3.6. Ionization Parameter

The ionization parameters (q) in star-forming galax-
ies at z ∼ 2 − 3 are higher than those in local star-
forming galaxies by about 0.6 dex (e.g., Kewley et al.
2013a,b; Nakajima & Ouchi 2014). It has been suggested
that the high ionization parameter is mainly responsible
for the oﬀset between z ∼ 2.3 and local star-forming
BPT locus (e.g., Kewley et al. 2013a,b). Here, we com-
pare the ionization parameters in the local analogs
for high-redshift galaxies with those in low- and high-

redshift galaxies. We adopt the same method as used in
Kobulnicky & Kewley (2004) (see also Kewley & Ellison
2008) to measure the ionization parameters in the local
analogs. This method is based on the photoionization
models from Kewley & Dopita (2002). The ionization
parameter is determined mainly by using the ratio of
[O III]λλ4959,5007 and [O II]λ3727 (O32). For a ﬁxed
O32, the oxygen abundance also aﬀects the ionization pa-
rameter measurement. Therefore, the ionization parame-
ter should be corrected for the oxygen abundance derived
from the ratio between [O II]λ3727+[O III]λλ4959,5007
and Hβ (R23). We refer readers to section A2.3 in
Kewley & Ellison (2008) for more details on the ioniza-
tion parameter measurements.

Figure 7 shows the distribution of the ionization pa-
rameter in both local analogs for high-redshift galaxies
(blue histogram) and the SDSS star-forming galaxies.
The local SDSS galaxies have a median log(q cm s−1)) =
7.29, which is consistent with the ionization param-
eters found in nearby star-forming galaxies in other
studies
(e.g., Dopita et al. 2006; Liang et al. 2006;
Kewley & Ellison 2008; Nakajima & Ouchi 2014). The
ionization parameter in our local analogs is about 0.6 dex
higher than that in local star-forming galaxies, with a
median ionization parameter of log(q (cm s−1)) = 7.94
(blue dashed line). This value is in agreement with the
ionization parameter found in the z ∼ 2 − 3 star-forming
galaxies, with a median value of log(q (cm s−1)) = 7.91
(e.g., Nakajima & Ouchi 2014).

3.7. Mass-Metallicity Relation

The relation between galaxy stellar mass and gas-phase
metallicities has been established in both low-redshift
and high-redshift star-forming galaxies (Tremonti et al.
2004; Savaglio et al. 2005; Kewley & Ellison 2008;
Erb et al. 2006; Maiolino et al. 2008; Zahid et al. 2013,
2014; Steidel et al. 2014; Maier et al. 2014; Sanders et al.
2015). These studies also suggest a strong evolution

Fig. 8.— Mass-metallicity relation (MZR) of local analogs for
high-redshift galaxies, SDSS galaxies, and high-redshift galaxies.
The light blue points represent the MZR of individual local analogs,
and the dark blue points with error bars represent the median
metallicity of local analogs in each stellar mass bin. The horizon-
tal error bar shows the stellar mass range in each mass bin, and
the vertical error bar represents the 16th and 84th percentiles of
the oxygen abundance distribution in each mass bin. The light
blue solid line represents the best linear ﬁt for the local analogs
with M∗ < 109.5 M⊙ (Equation 4). The black solid line represents
the median MZR of SDSS galaxies, and two dashed lines repre-
sent the 16th and 84th percentiles of the oxygen abundance dis-
tribution. The purple points and orange triangles with error bars
represents the MZR of z ∼ 2.3 UV-selected star-forming galaxies
from Steidel et al. (2014, S14) and Erb et al. (2006, E06), respec-
tively. The horizontal error bar shows the stellar mass range in
each mass bin, and the vertical error bar indicates the uncertainty
in oxygen abundance estimated from the uncertainty on composite
emission-line ﬂuxes for each stellar mass bin (Steidel et al. 2014).

of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) between low-
and high-redshift galaxies: high-redshift galaxies have
smaller metallicities than galaxies in the local universe
at a ﬁxed mass.

We compare the MZRs in the local SDSS galaxies,
local analogs, and high-redshift galaxies. We mea-
sured the gas-phase oxygen abundance based on the
N2 (log([N IIλ6583]/Hα) (Pettini & Pagel 2004, PP04
hereafter).
In the absence of other strong-line ratios
which are sensitive to metallicity, as is often the case in
high-redshift galaxies, PP04 calibrated the N2 metallic-
ity diagnostic using Te-based direct metallicity measure-
ments in a sample of local H II regions. The N2 index
has been widely used in high-redshift galaxy metallicity
measurements (e.g., Erb et al. 2006; Hainline et al. 2009;
Bian et al. 2010; Steidel et al. 2014). Figure 8 shows
the mass-metallicity relation in the SDSS star-forming
galaxies, the local analogs for high-redshift galaxies, and
the z ∼ 2 − 3 UV-selected star-forming galaxies. The
solid line represents the median value of the MZR of the
SDSS galaxies, and the light blue ﬁlled circles represent
the MZR of the local analogs. We also show the me-
dian metallicity of the local analogs in each 0.5 mass bin
(dark blue ﬁlled circles in Figure 8). For the z ∼ 2 − 3
galaxies, we show the MZR from Steidel et al. (2014).

Fig. 9.— Similar to Figure 8, but the red lines represent the MZR

of a subsample of SDSS galaxies with log(N II/Hα)< −0.5.

We ﬁt the MZR of local analogs linearly at the low mass
end (M∗ < 109.5 M⊙) because MZR at the high mass
end (M∗ > 109.5 M⊙) is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by our se-
lection methods. The light blue line represents the best
log-linear ﬁt with the following equation:

12 + log(O/H) = 8.5 + 0.26 × [log(M∗/M⊙) − 10]; (4)

At the low mass end (M∗ = 109.0M⊙), the MZR of the lo-
cal analogs is comparable to that at z ∼ 2.3 Steidel et al.
(2014), and is 0.2-0.3 dex lower than the full SDSS sam-
ple a ﬁxed stellar mass.

The properties of the local analogs could be bi-
ased by the equation (3) in the selection criterion
(log([N II]/Hα)< −0.5). This criterion places the up-
per limit of the metallicity at 12 + log(O/H) = 8.62
based on the PP04 calibration, and it also tends to se-
lect galaxies with stellar mass less than 5 × 1010 M⊙
due to the MZR. This metallicity cut also reduces the
median value of the metallicity for a given stellar mass
bin, which could potentially cause the oﬀset of the MZR
between SDSS galaxies and local analogs shown in Fig-
ure 8. We apply the same [N II]/Hα cut to the SDSS
galaxies to investigate how the line ratio cut aﬀects the
MZR. In Figure 9, we compare the MZR of the SDSS
galaxies (black curve) with that in SDSS galaxies with
log([N II]/Hα)< −0.5 (red curve). We ﬁnd that the
MZRs are consistent with each other at the low mass
end, where log(M∗(M⊙)) < 9.5. The metallicity in the
SDSS galaxies with log(N II/Hα)< −0.5 becomes signif-
icantly smaller than that in the SDSS galaxies without
the metallicity cut when log(M∗(M⊙)) > 9.5. Therefore,
we expect that the selection eﬀect would aﬀect only the
MZR of the local analogs at log(M∗(M⊙)) > 9.5, and
that at log(M∗(M⊙)) < 9.5, the oﬀset MZR between the
analogs and normal SDSS galaxies shown in Figure 8 is
not due to selection eﬀects.

4. COMPARISON WITH OTHER LOCAL ANALOGS

F. Bian et al.

4.1. Lyman Break Analogs
established a

(2005)

sample

Heckman et al.

of
ultraviolet-luminous galaxies (UVLGs) based on their
FUV luminosities LFUV ≥ 2 × 1010L⊙. A subset of
super compact UVLGs with the highest surface bright-
nesses (IFUV ≥ 109L⊙/kpc2) closely resemble the prop-
erties of high-redshift Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs)
(e.g., Hoopes et al. 2007), and thus this type of galaxy is
also called Lyman break analogs (LBAs).

We calculate the FUV luminosity of the local analogs
selected in this study with 3σ detection in the GALEX
FUV band. We ﬁnd that 35 of our local analogs have a
FUV luminosity LFUV ≥ 2 × 1010L⊙, which would have
been selected as UVLGs, and 49% of our local analogs
have a FUV surface brightness of IFUV ≥ 109L⊙/kpc2.
The local analogs selected in this study well resemble the
FUV/SFR surface density in the LBA and high-redshift
LBGs, although they diﬀer in their SFRs and FUV lu-
minosities with the LBAs and LBGs.

We further study the location in the BPT diagram of
the LBAs. We use a sample of UVLGs from Hoopes et al.
(2007), which includes 215 galaxies. We ﬁnd 35 of them
with FUV surface brightness, IFUV ≥ 109L⊙/kpc2. We
obtained the emission line ﬂux of these 35 LBAs by
cross-correlating their positions with the MPA-JHU cat-
alog. To make a fair comparison between the LBAs
and the local analogs in this work, we apply the same
[N II]/Hα cut that has been used for our local analogs
([N II]/Hα < −0.5) to the LBAs. We ﬁnd that 27 LBAs
with [N II]/Hα < −0.5. Placing the 27 LBAs on the BPT
diagram, we ﬁnd that 22 of them (82%) are located above
the local star-forming sequence deﬁned by equation 3 in
Kewley et al. (2013a). This suggests that the LBA also
show an oﬀset in the BPT diagram compared to normal
local star-forming galaxies. However, the oﬀset is not as
large as that has been found in the z ∼ 2 star-forming
galaxies. Eight out of the 27 (30%) LBAs lie within the
high-redshift star-forming locus (the region between the
two red solid lines in Figure 1) in the BPT diagram, and
two LBAs (7%) satisfy our local analog selection criteria
(equations 1-3).

We compute the electron densities and ionization pa-
rameters in the 27 LBAs. We ﬁnd a median electron den-
sity of ne = 110 cm−3 in LBAs, which is about 4 times
larger than that in normal SDSS galaxies, but a factor of
2 smaller than that in our local analogs. Overzier et al.
(2009) measured electron density in 29 LBAs using the
[S II] doublet, in which the median [S II] doublet is 1.3
corresponding to ne = 132 cm−3. This value is consis-
tent with the median electron density in the LBAs in this
study. Using the O32 and R23 indices, we ﬁnd a median
ionization parameter of q = 7.78 in the 27 LBAs, which
is smaller than that in our local analogs by ∼ 0.15 dex.
Therefore, the local analogs selected in this study more
closely resemble the ISM conditions and the ionization
radiation ﬁeld in z ∼ 2 − 3 star-forming galaxies than
the LBAs.

4.2. Green Pea Galaxies

The green pea (GP) galaxies are selected based on their
strong [O III] emission line of EW0 > 100˚Aand compact
morphologies. Cardamone et al. (2009) selected a sam-
ple of green pea galaxies at 0.112 < z < 0.36. In this

Local Analogs

redshift range, the strong [O III] emission falls into the
SDSS r-band ﬁlter, separating the GP galaxies from nor-
mal galaxies and quasars in the g − r versus r − i color-
color diagram (Figure 2 in Cardamone et al. 2009)).

We apply the same g − r and r − i color-color selection
criteria in Cardamone et al. (2009) to our local analogs.
We ﬁnd that only ∼ 20% of the local analogs could be se-
lected as GP galaxies. The majority of our local analogs
also have strong [O III] emission lines: 70% of the lo-
cal analogs have a [O III] rest-frame equivalent width
EW0 > 100˚A. Most of the galaxies that cannot be se-
lected with the GP method have a lower redshift than
the GP redshift selection windows. The [O III] lines at
z < 0.1 do not fall into the SDSS r-band ﬁlter, which
cannot place our local analogs in the same regions in the
r − i version g − r color-color diagram as GP galaxies.
We compared the stellar mass, SFR, and sSFRs in the
local analogs in this study with the GP galaxies. The me-
dian sSFR of the GP galaxies is about 2 Gyr−1, which
is consistent with that in our local analogs, although the
median stellar mass and SFR in our local analogs are 2
times smaller than those in GP galaxies.

We investigate the location of the GP galaxies in the
BPT diagram. About 39% of the GP galaxies satisfy our
local analog selection criteria in this study, and 92% of
the GPs galaxies fall into the high-redshift star-forming
BPT locus. The median ionization parameter of GP
galaxies is 7.93 (Nakajima & Ouchi 2014), which is con-
sistent with that of the local analogs selected in this work.
We compute the electron densities in the GP galaxies
and ﬁnd that the median electron density of the GPs is
160 cm−3, which is slightly smaller than that in our lo-
cal analogs (ne ≃ 200 cm−3). These properties suggest
that both our local analogs and the GP galaxies have
ISM conditions similar to high-redshift galaxies (e.g.,
Steidel et al. 2014). Our local analog selection criteria
probes galaxies with lower stellar masses and SFRs but
with wider ranges of redshift and size distributions. In
particular, the selection method used in this study is able
to select a signiﬁcant population (∼50%) of local analogs
for high-redshift galaxies at z < 0.1.

4.3. SDSS Galaxies with High Line Luminosity

Juneau et al. (2014) suggested that the evolution of
the ISM conditions from high-redshift (z ∼ 1.5) to low-
redshift galaxies may partially be due to the selection
eﬀects because only galaxies with high line luminosities
can be studied at high-redshift. Therefore, the SDSS
galaxies with high line luminosities may also be con-
sidered as local analogs for high-redshift galaxies. The
line ﬂux limit with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 5 is
4.4 × 10−18 ergs s−1 cm−2 in the sample of z ∼ 2.3
star-forming galaxies in (Steidel et al. 2014), which cor-
responds to an Hβ luminosity of log[LLine(ergs s−1)] =
41.2. We select a sample of SDSS galaxies whose lumi-
nosities of Hβ, Hα, and [OIII]λ5007 luminosities are all
greater than log[LLine(ergs s−1)] = 41.2 and study their
locations on the BPT diagram, their ionization param-
eters, and their electron densities. We ﬁnd that there
is only 6% of the high line luminosity SDSS galaxies
fall into our selection criterion, and 23% of these SDSS
galaxies lie within the high-redshift star-forming locals
in the BPT diagram. The median ionization parameter

of these SDSS galaxies are 7.64 cm s−1, and the median
electron density is 101 cm−3. Both are larger than the
main sample of SDSS galaxies, but signiﬁcantly smaller
than those in our local analogs. This results suggest that
the selection eﬀect on the line luminosity can only par-
tially explain the ISM evolution from high redshift to low
redshift.

5. DISCUSSION

In section 3, we have demonstrated that the lo-
cal analogs have very unique physical ISM conditions,
which closely resemble those in high-redshift star-forming
galaxies. In this section, we will investigate how the ISM
conditions correlate with sSFR and SFR surface den-
sity (ΣSFR), and whether the high ionization parameter
and high electron density in our local analogs and high-
redshift galaxies are entirely caused by the evolution of
sSFR and SFR surface density from high redshift to low
redshift.

We use sSFR and SFR surface density to approxi-
mately represent the number of ionizing photons per
baryon and per volume in a galaxy, respectively. We
use the sSFR measurements in section 3.1 and compute
the SFR surface density by using the following equation,
ΣSFR = SFR/(2πr2
e), where re is the galaxy eﬀective
radius from Blanton et al. (2003) in the u-band. We use
the optical band to determine the re rather than the FUV
band because a large fraction of our local analogs can-
not be spatially resolved by GALEX FUV images due
to their compact size. We divide galaxies into diﬀerent
sSFR and SFR surface density bins and compute the me-
dian ionization parameter and electron density in each of
the bin to study how the ISM conditions change with the
sSFR and SFR surface density.

Figure 10 shows the median ionization parameters in
diﬀerent sSFR and SFR surface density bins. For the
SDSS galaxies, there exists a clear trend whereby the
ionization parameter increases with increasing sSFR and
SFR surface density (see also Brinchmann et al. 2008b).
We also ﬁnd a similar trend in our local analogs. We show
the diﬀerence in ionization between our local analogs and
the SDSS galaxies and in each sSFR and SFR surface
density bin in the right panel of Figure 10. For a ﬁxed
sSFR and SFR surface density, the ionization parameters
in the local analogs are systematically higher than those
in the SDSS galaxies by 0.25 dex.

Figure 11 shows the median electron density in dif-
ference sSFR and SFR surface density bins. For SDSS
galaxies, we ﬁnd that the electron density increases with
increasing SFR surface density for a ﬁxed sSFR, but de-
ceases with increasing sSFR for a ﬁxed SFR surface den-
sity. We do not ﬁnd a similar trend in our local analogs.
Due to the relatively large uncertainties on the electron
density measurements (∼ 0.3 dex), a larger sample of
local analogs is required to study the relation between
electron density and sSFR as well as SFR surface den-
sity. The rightmost panel of Figure 11 shows the dif-
ference in electron density between our local analogs and
the SDSS galaxies in each sSFR and SFR surface density
bin. We ﬁnd that our local analogs have higher electron
density than the SDSS galaxies with similar sSFR and
SFR surface density by 0.19 dex.

The high sSFR and high SFR surface density can aﬀect
the ionization parameter and electron density in a galaxy.

Fig. 11.— Electron density as functions of sSFR and SFR surface density in the SDSS galaxies (left panel), the local analogs in this study
(middle panel), and the electron density diﬀerence between the local analogs and SDSS galaxies as functions of sSFR and SFR surface
density (right panel). The local analogs have higher electron density than the SDSS galaxies for a given sSFR and SFR surface density.

However, they can only partially explain the high ioniza-
tion parameters and high electron densities in the local
analogs and high-redshift galaxies. Therefore, additional
mechanisms are required to fully explain the evolution of
the ISM conditions from the normal nearby galaxies to
the local analogs and high-redshift galaxies.

For a ionization-bounded H II region, the ioniza-
tion parameter, q, can be expressed as follows (e.g.,
Charlot & Longhetti 2001; Brinchmann et al. 2008a;

Nakajima & Ouchi 2014):

q ∝ (QnHǫ2)

1

3 ,

(5)

where Q is the rate of ionizing photons, nH is the number
density of hydrogen, and ǫ is the gas ﬁlling factor. We ex-
plore how these three parameters inﬂuence the ionization
parameters as follows.

• The rate of ionizing photons depends not only on
SFR, but also on the hardness of the radiation ﬁeld.
The hardness of the radiation ﬁeld is sensitive to

Local Analogs

the slope of the Initial Mass Function (IMF), the
star formation history, the metallicity, shocks and
AGN activity: (1) A top-heavy IMF (more mas-
sive stars for a given total stellar mass) would pro-
duce a harder far-UV spectrum. However, there
is no clear evidence that the IMF varies over the
cosmic time (see Bastian et al. 2010, and reference
therein). Moreover, Dopita et al. (2014) found that
the eﬀect of the IMF slope is rather small, and can
only increase the ionization parameter by 0.1 dex at
most; (2) A young stellar population dominated by
W-R stars may produce a hard ionizing radiation
ﬁeld. The W-R phase happens at 3-5 Myr after
an instantaneous bursts, which could also enhance
the ratio of [O III/Hβ] to move star-forming galax-
ies from the local BPT locus into the high-redshift
BPT locus (Brinchmann et al. 2008a). We visually
inspect the SDSS spectra of these local analogs to
search for the broad component He IIλ4686 and
N IIIλ4640 features, which can be used to identify
W-R galaxies (Brinchmann et al. 2008a). How-
ever, most of the spectra are too noisy to iden-
tify these broad components. Further deep opti-
cal spectroscopic observations are required to study
these W-R features; (3) A harder ionizing ﬁeld
could be produced by a population of metal-poor
stars due to lower stellar atmospheric blanketing
and lower mass-loss (e.g., Levesque et al. 2010).
Thus, the ionizing radiation ﬁeld are likely to be
harder in local analogs and high-z galaxies due
to their relative lower metallicity; (4) Shocks and
AGNs could also also produce a harder radiation
ﬁeld and enhance ionization parameters, and AGNs
and shock signatures have been found in high-
redshift star-forming galaxies (e.g., Newman et al.
2014; Genzel et al. 2014). We cross correlate our
analogs with the ROSAT ALL-Sky Survey Faint
Source Catalog (Voges et al. 2000) and ﬁnd that
only one of the targets is detected in the X-ray
wavelength. Greene & Ho (2004) found that the
AGNs hosting low mass black holes (< 2×106 M⊙)
also show an oﬀset compared to the local star-
forming sequence in the BPT diagram. We use the
FWHM of Hα to understand the possible contam-
ination from broad-line AGNs. We ﬁnd that the
median Hα FWHM of our local analogs is about
200 km s−1, which is much smaller than the Hα
FWHM (> 600 km s−1) in the broad-line AGNs
hosting low mass black holes (< 2 × 106 M⊙) (e.g.
Greene & Ho 2004, 2007). There are only three lo-
cal analogs in this work with Hα FWHM greater
than 500 km s−1. These two pieces of evidence
suggest that the AGN contamination rate is low in
these galaxies.

• The ionization parameter only mildly depends on
the hydrogen density, which can be approached by
electron density, ne. We have found that the elec-
tron density is 0.19 dex higher in local analogs,
which account for a mild increase of about 0.06 dex
in ionization parameter, q.

• The ﬁlling factor in the local H II regions is between
0.01 and 0.1 (Kennicutt 1984). However, this value

is very diﬃcult to measure in high-redshift galaxies.

Therefore, it is still unclear which factor is the domi-
nant source causing the high ionization parameter in the
our local analogs and high-redshift galaxies in this stage.
Further deep long slit and IFS spectroscopic observations
will enable us to study the W-R features and obtain spa-
tially resolved line ratios and ionization parameter maps.
These follow-up observations will provide clues to solve
this problem.

The above discussion is based on the conditions in
radiation-bounded clouds.
In this case, the size of the
H II region is determined by the ionization equilibrium
between the production rate of the ionizing photons and
the recombination rate. However, if the surrounding H I
cloud is not enough to absorb all of the ionizing photons,
then the ionizing photons from stars will ionize the en-
tire surrounding cloud. In this type of density-bounded
cloud, the [O II] zone becomes smaller, and the [O III]
zone is unlikely to be largely aﬀected, resulting in an en-
hancement of the [O III]/[O II] ratio and an overestimate
of the ionization parameters (e.g., Brinchmann et al.
2008a; Kewley et al. 2013a; Nakajima & Ouchi 2014).

6. CONCLUSION

We have presented a sample of local analogs for high-
redshift galaxies. These analogs are selected to overlap
with the extreme oﬀset galaxies at high redshift in the
BPT diagram. These galaxies are characterized by their
ISM and ionization ﬁeld conditions, which are similar to
those in z ∼ 2 − 3 galaxies. Therefore, this type of local
analog is ideal for detailed studies attempting to under-
stand ISM and ionization ﬁeld conditions in high-redshift
galaxies. We summarize the main scientiﬁc results as fol-
lows:

1. We use the location of the galaxies in the [O III]/Hβ
versus [N II]/Hα nebular emission-line diagnos-
tic diagram (the BPT diagram) to select local
analogs for high-redshift galaxies. These analogs
occupy the same locations as the z ∼ 2 − 3 star-
forming galaxies in the BPT diagram. Based on
this method, 252 local analogs are selected in a
sample of nearby galaxies from the SDSS DR7.

2. We study the properties of the local analogs for
high-redshift galaxies. We ﬁnd that these galaxies
share many properties with typical z ∼ 2 − 3 UV-
selected galaxies, including similar high sSFRs, ﬂat
UV continuum slopes, dust attenuation properties,
and compact morphologies. However, compared to
typical L∗ UV-selected galaxies at z ∼ 2 − 3, our
analogs have lower FUV luminosity, star formation
rate, and stellar mass.

3. Our local analogs have high ionization parameters
(log q ≃ 7.94 cm−1), and high electron densities
(ne ≃ 200 cm−3). The ionization parameter is
comparable to that found in the z ∼ 2 − 3 galax-
ies and is about 0.6 dex higher than that in the
SDSS galaxies. The electron density in our local
analogs is an order of magnitude higher than that
in the SDSS galaxies. Therefore, this type of local
analog well resembles the ionization ﬁeld and ISM
conditions in high-redshift galaxies.

4. We ﬁnd that the metallicity-mass relation (MZR)
in the local analogs is 0.2 dex lower than that in the
SDSS galaxies, which is consistent with that found
in z ∼ 2 − 3 UV-selected galaxies (Steidel et al.
2014) at the low mass end (M∗ = 109.0 M⊙).

5. We compare our local analogs with those se-
lected with other methods, including Lyman break
analogs (LBAs) and green pea (GP) galaxies. We
ﬁnd that the UV luminosities in our local analogs
are signiﬁcantly lower than those in the Lyman
break analogs. However, the UV surface bright-
ness is comparable to that in the Lyman break
analogs and green pea. About 7% of the Lyman
break analogs fall into the BPT region used to se-
lect our local analogs, and about 30% of the Lyman
break analogs lie in the BPT region that was de-
ﬁned by z ∼ 2 UV-selected star-forming galaxies
(Steidel et al. 2014). We ﬁnd that both the ion-
ization parameters and the electron density in the
Lyman break analogs are signiﬁcantly smaller than
those in our local analogs. The green pea galax-
ies have a better agreement on the location of the
BPT diagram and ionization parameters with the
analogs in this study. However, our local analogs
have a wider redshift distribution than GP galax-
ies.

6. We ﬁnd that the local analogs have higher electron
densities and ionization parameters than the SDSS

galaxies with similar sSFR and SFR surface den-
sity, suggesting that sSFR and SFR surface density
are not fully responsible for the diﬀerence in the
ISM conditions between the local analogs and nor-
mal nearby SDSS galaxies. Additional mechanisms
are needed to fully explain the diﬀerence.

Further studies based on the GAMA, 6dF, and fur-
ther planned spectroscopic surveys will signiﬁcantly ex-
tend the sample size of the local analogs for high-redshift
galaxies. The local analogs selected using this method
could provide a great deal of information on the physi-
cal conditions of ISM in high-redshift galaxies. Further
spatially resolved spectroscopic and high-spatial resolu-
tion imaging observations on these galaxies will enable
us to resolve the individual star forming regions in these
galaxies, study the detailed physical properties in these
star-forming regions and make direct comparison with
the star-forming regions in high-redshift universe.
