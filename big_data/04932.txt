Abstract

The stable and unstable manifolds of an invariant set of a piecewise-smooth map are
themselves piecewise-smooth. Consequently, as parameters of a piecewise-smooth map
are varied, an invariant set can develop a homoclinic connection when its stable mani-
fold intersects a non-diﬀerentiable point of its unstable manifold (or vice-versa). This is a
codimension-one bifurcation analogous to a homoclinic tangency of a smooth map, referred
to here as a homoclinic corner. This paper presents an unfolding of generic homoclinic
corners for saddle ﬁxed points of planar piecewise-smooth continuous maps. It is shown
that a sequence of border-collision bifurcations limits to a homoclinic corner and that all
nearby periodic solutions are unstable.

Introduction

A transverse intersection between the stable and unstable manifolds of an invariant set implies
the existence of a Smale horseshoe and chaotic dynamics [1, 2]. For smooth maps, transverse
intersections are born in homoclinic tangencies where stable and unstable manifolds intersect
tangentially. For piecewise-smooth (PWS) maps, however, stable and unstable manifolds can be
continuous but non-diﬀerentiable. Transverse intersections may be created when one manifold
intersects a non-diﬀerentiable point of the other manifold. Locally one manifold has a V-shape,
instead of the U-shape of a quadratic tangency, and here the bifurcation is referred to as a
homoclinic corner. The purpose of this paper is to unfold a generic homoclinic corner.

For simplicity only continuous planar maps are considered. Speciﬁcally, this paper considers

maps of the form

where the regions M1, . . . , Mm partition the domain M ⊂ R2. Each fj : Mj × R → M is
smooth and smoothly extendable into an open set containing the closure of Mj. The boundaries
of the Mj are one-dimensional PWS manifolds, termed switching manifolds, and on the switching
manifolds f is continuous. Maps of the form (1.1) provide useful mathematical models of discrete-
time phenomena with switching events, particularly in social sciences [3], and arise as return maps
of PWS systems of diﬀerential equations [4].

First let us discuss border-collision bifurcations (BCBs) of (1.1). As the parameter ξ is varied,
(1.1) undergoes a BCB when a ﬁxed point collides with a switching manifold [5]. By expanding
(1.1) about the BCB and truncating the expansion to leading order, one obtains a piecewise-linear
map that approximates the local dynamics. Structurally stable dynamics of the piecewise-linear
approximation are exhibited by (1.1) near the BCB. If the BCB is non-degenerate, then the
piecewise-linear approximation can be transformed to

where τL, δL, τR, δR, µ ∈ R are parameters. The map (1.2) is known as the two-dimensional
border-collision normal form [6, 7].

The border-collision normal form arises in the analysis below. But it is also an instance of
the general form (1.1), and so here it is used to illustrate homoclinic corners. As an example,

Figure 1: A bifurcation set of the two-dimensional border-collision normal form (1.2) with (1.3).
The black curves are loci of homoclinic corners. The three black dots indicate the parameter
values of Fig. 2. The coloured regions are mode-locking regions within which (1.2) has a stable
periodic solution of a period indicated by the grid on the right. These are shown up to period
30. At points where mode-locking regions overlap, the highest period is indicated. Only mode-
locking regions corresponding to “rotational” periodic solutions [5, 8] are shown, because these
can be computed eﬃciently and accurately and other mode-locking regions that exist over the
given parameter range were found to be relatively small.

with

τL = 2 ,

δL = 0.75 ,

µ = 1 ,

(1.3)

and any τR, δR ∈ R, the map (1.2) has a ﬁxed point (x, y) = (−4, 3) with eigenvalues λ = 0.5 and
σ = 1.5. The stable and unstable manifolds of the ﬁxed point exhibit a homoclinic corner along
the two curves shown in Fig. 1. In order to indicate attractors, this ﬁgure also shows mode-locking
regions – where stable periodic solutions exist. However, as explained below these have little
relevance to the homoclinic corners (except near the codimension-two point (τR, δR) = (−0.5, 1.5)
where the intersecting branches of the stable and unstable manifolds are coincident).

With τR = −0.6, for example, a homoclinic corner occurs at δR = 1.35. Fig. 2 shows phase
portraits at, and on either side of, the homoclinic corner. On one side of the homoclinic corner
the stable and unstable manifolds of the ﬁxed point do not intersect. A chaotic attractor appears
to be the only attractor of (1.2) for all 1.25 ≤ δR ≤ 1.35. This attractor is destroyed at the
homoclinic corner in a crisis [9]. On the other side of the homoclinic corner there is transient
chaos and typical forward orbits diverge.

The destruction of a chaotic attractor in a homoclinic corner is described in [10] and other
transitions are also possible. For instance, as a homoclinic corner of Fig. 1 with δR < 1 is
crossed, the basin of attraction of a stable ﬁxed point appears to become fractal. Other numerical
explorations have revealed that an invariant circle can be destroyed at a homoclinic corner [10, 11]
and the number of bands in a chaotic attractor can change [12].

Homoclinic corners may be viewed as continuous but non-diﬀerentiable distortions of homo-
clinic tangencies. For this reason it is expected that the two types of bifurcation exhibit similar
unfoldings. Consider for a moment a homoclinic tangency for a ﬁxed point in a smooth two-
dimensional map with eigenvalues λ and σ that satisfy 0 < λ < 1 < σ. Suppose that the map
depends smoothly on a scalar parameter ξ and that the tangency occurs at ξ = 0. The simplest
bifurcations near ξ = 0 involve single-round periodic solutions. These involve one excursion far

each phase portrait the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle ﬁxed point (x, y) = (−4, 3)

(x, y) = (0, 0), with the ﬁrst 103 points removed. Each phase portrait also shows two single-round
periodic solutions of period n = 8, see Fig. 3.

from the ﬁxed point. Generically, for suﬃciently large values of n ∈ Z+, a pair of single-round
periodic solutions of period n is created in a saddle-node bifurcation at some ξ = ξn, with ξn → 0
as n → ∞. If λσ < 1, then one of these periodic solutions is stable, and there exists C 6= 0 such
that

ξn = Cσ−n + O(λn) + O(cid:0)σ−2n(cid:1) ,

see [13, 14, 15]. Near each ξ = ξn, the stable period-n solution loses stability in a period-doubling
bifurcation, beyond which there is a period-doubling cascade leading to a chaotic attractor that
is subsequently destroyed in a homoclinic tangency. The dynamics are well approximated by a
one-dimensional quadratic map that can be used to explain this bifurcation sequence [1].

(1.4)

Fig. 3-A is a bifurcation diagram showing single-round periodic solutions near the homoclinic
corner of Fig. 2. These are created in pairs at BCBs. Fig. 3-B shows that the fraction δRn −δR,HC
,
−δR,HC
appears to converge to σ as n → ∞, where δR,HC = 1.35 and δRn denotes the BCB value at which
period-n solutions are created. This suggests that the BCBs adhere to the same scaling law as
the saddle-node bifurcations (1.4).

δRn+1

For this example λσ < 1, yet all the periodic solutions indicated in Fig. 3-A are unstable.
The same observation was made in [5] for a homoclinic corner to a period-3 solution of (1.2). In
contrast, near the codimension-three homoclinic points of (1.2) described in [16, 17], single-round
periodic solutions are stable and can coexist in arbitrarily large numbers.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. The next section introduces equations
useful for analysing the dynamics near an arbitrary homoclinic corner of (1.1). Section 3 provides
conditions on the parameters in these equations that ensure genericity. In §4 single-round periodic
solutions are described and it is proved that all periodic solutions near a homoclinic corner (single-
round and multi-round) are unstable. In §5 BCBs of single-round periodic solutions are analysed.

It is shown that the BCBs indeed satisfy the scaling law (1.4) and that the periodic solutions
are saddles with stable and unstable manifolds that intersect transversally. Finally, §6 provides
a summary and discussion.

2 Equations describing a homoclinic corner

Here we introduce coordinates and equations that capture the dynamics near a generic homoclinic
corner of the PWS map f , (1.1). We ﬁrst deﬁne linearising coordinates in a neighbourhood of a
saddle ﬁxed point, then describe excursions away from the ﬁxed point. This approach has been
successful for unfolding a variety of generic and degenerate homoclinic tangencies of smooth
maps, see for instance [1, 13, 18, 19, 20].

Throughout this paper f n denotes the composition of f with itself n times. Given a list of

indices L = j0 · · · jn−1, where each ji ∈ {1, . . . , m},

fL = fjn−1 ◦ · · · ◦ fj0 ,

(2.1)

denotes the composition of the components of f in the order speciﬁed by L.

Linearising coordinates

We assume the homoclinic corner occurs at ξ = 0. Moreover, we assume that the saddle ﬁxed
point associated with the homoclinic corner lies at the origin and in the interior of M1 for all
suﬃciently small values of ξ. We let λ(ξ) and σ(ξ) denote the eigenvalues of the ﬁxed point, and
assume

If instead one or both eigenvalues are negative, we can study f 2. We also assume

0 < λ(0) < 1 < σ(0) .

λ(0)σ(0) < 1 .

(2.2)

(2.3)

If instead λ(0)σ(0) > 1 and f is invertible, we can study f −1.

We assume each fj is C ∞. This ensures that there exists C ∞ linearising coordinates [21, 22].
That is, there exists a C ∞ coordinate change and an open bounded convex neighbourhood N ⊂
M1 that contains the origin, such that within N the map f is given by

f1(x, y; ξ) =(cid:20)λ(ξ)x
σ(ξ)y(cid:21) ,

(2.4)

for all suﬃciently small values of ξ. If instead we only assumed that each fj was C 2, then we can
only guarantee the existence of C 1 linearising coordinates [1, 22]. In this scenario the main results
of this paper are unchanged but the error terms in the key expressions are more complicated to
state.

We use W s(0, 0; ξ) and W u(0, 0; ξ) to denote the stable and unstable manifolds of the origin
for the map f , and use Es(0, 0; ξ) and Eu(0, 0; ξ) to denote the stable and unstable manifolds of
the origin for the linearisation (2.4). Notice, Es(0, 0; ξ) and Eu(0, 0; ξ) are, respectively, the x
and y-axes minus the origin. Since f is equal to its linearisation inside N , the parts of W s(0, 0; ξ)
and W u(0, 0; ξ) that emanate from the origin are equal to Es(0, 0; ξ) and Eu(0, 0; ξ) within N .

5

Consequences of a homoclinic corner

We now exploit the assumption that the origin has a homoclinic corner for ξ = 0. This assumption
implies that there exists a point in Eu(0, 0; 0) ∩ N that maps to a point in Es(0, 0; 0) ∩ N under
r iterations of f , for some r ∈ Z+, and that the manifold f r(Eu(0, 0; 0)) forms a corner at the
point in Es(0, 0; 0) ∩ N . By scaling the x and y coordinates, we can assume that these points
are (0, 1) and (1, 0) respectively, that is,

(cid:20)1
0(cid:21) = f r(0, 1; 0) ,

(2.5)

see Fig. 4.

Since f r(Eu(0, 0; 0)) forms a corner at (1, 0), the forward orbit of (0, 1) must intersect a
switching manifold of f before reaching (1, 0). That is, there exists s ∈ {1, . . . , r − 1} such that
f s(0, 1; 0) ∈ Σ, where Σ is a switching manifold of f . For genericity we require s to be unique,
that is f i(0, 1; 0) does not lie on a switching manifold of f for all i ∈ {1, . . . , r − 1}, i 6= s. We
also assume that Σ is locally a C 2 curve, and write

for a C 2 function h. For (x, y) near (0, 1) and small values of ξ, we can therefore write

Σ = {(x, y) | h(x, y; ξ) = 0} ,

f r(x, y; ξ) =(fX (x, y; ξ) , h(f s(x, y; ξ); ξ) ≤ 0

fY (x, y; ξ) , h(f s(x, y; ξ); ξ) ≥ 0

,

(2.6)

(2.7)

where X and Y are lists of indices of length r that diﬀer only in index s.

Given ξ, the set of all (x, y) near (0, 1) for which h(f s(x, y; ξ); ξ) = 0 is f −s(Σ) – the inverse
of Σ under f s, or the part of the inverse of Σ that lies near (0, 1) in the case that f s has multiple

inverses. For genericity we require f −s(Σ) to be a curve transversally intersecting Eu(0, 0; 0) at
(0, 1) for ξ = 0, as shown in Fig. 4. Since f is C ∞ and h is C 2, we can write

h(f s(x, y; ξ); ξ) = p1x + p2(y − 1) + p3ξ + O(cid:0)kx, y − 1, ξk2(cid:1) ,

for some constants p1, p2, p3 ∈ R, where O denotes “big-O notation”. The transversal intersection
is ensured by assuming p2 6= 0. Moreover, by scaling h we can assume

(2.8)

Then by (2.8) and (2.9), we can write

p2 = 1 .

where g is a C 2 function satisfying

f −s(Σ) = {(x, y) | y = g(x; ξ)} ,

We can also rewrite (2.7) as

g(x; ξ) = 1 − p1x − p3ξ + O(cid:0)kx, ξk2(cid:1) .

To study the behaviour of fX and fY near (x, y) = (0, 1) and for small values of ξ, we expand
fX and fY about (x, y; ξ) = (0, 1; 0). Since f is continuous, fX and fY are equal on f −s(Σ). It
follows that there exist constants a1, a2, bX

If det (DfX ) |(0,1;0) and det (DfY) |(0,1;0) are both positive, then f r is also locally

3 Three genericity assumptions

In this section we identify three additional conditions necessary to have a generic homoclinic
corner.

7

A transversal intersection between f r−s(Σ) and Es

As explained above, f −s(Σ) is a curve transversally intersecting Eu(0, 0; 0) at (0, 1) for ξ = 0,
Fig. 4. For genericity we also require that f r−s(Σ) is a curve transversally intersecting Es(0, 0; 0)
at (1, 0) for ξ = 0. By (2.12) and (2.13), points on f r−s(Σ) for ξ = 0 are given by

Thus the condition

f r(x, g(x; 0); 0) =(cid:20)1 + a1x

a2x (cid:21) + O(cid:0)|x|2(cid:1) .

a2 6= 0 ,
ensures f r−s(Σ) transversally intersects Es(0, 0; 0).

A sign condition ensuring a homoclinic corner

(3.1)

(3.2)

We have assumed that f r(Eu(0, 0; 0)) forms a corner at (1, 0) ∈ Es(0, 0; 0). That is, locally,
f r(Eu(0, 0; 0)) includes the point (1, 0) and otherwise either lies entirely above Es(0, 0; 0) or
below Es(0, 0; 0). By (2.12) and (2.13), points on f r(Eu(0, 0; 0)) are given by

f r(0, y; 0) =

.

(3.3)

(3.4)

ensures that f r(Eu(0, 0; 0)) intersects Es(0, 0; 0) at a corner.

By (3.1) and (3.3), the orientation of f r−s(Σ) and f r(Eu(0, 0; 0)) near (1, 0) for ξ = 0 is
governed by the signs of a2 and bX
2 , as we now assume (3.4) holds). This is
summarised by Fig. 5. The part of f −s(Σ) near (0, 1) that lies to the right of the y-axis maps
to the part of f r−s(Σ) near (1, 0) below the x-axis if a2 < 0, and to the part of f r−s(Σ) near
(1, 0) above the x-axis if a2 > 0. Near (1, 0), the manifold f r(Eu(0, 0; 0)) lies above the x-axis if
2 < 0, and below the x-axis if bX
bX

2 (or equivalently bY

2 > 0.

A condition ensuring a generic unfolding

Lastly we need to ensure that ξ unfolds the homoclinic corner in a generic fashion. That is, we
require that the distance from the corner of f r(Eu(0, 0; ξ)) near (1, 0) to Es(0, 0; ξ) is a linear
function of ξ, to leading order. The corner is located at the image of Eu(0, 0; ξ) ∩ f −s(Σ) under
f r. The intersection Eu(0, 0; ξ) ∩ f −s(Σ) is given by (x, y) = (0, g(0; ξ)) and by (2.13) its image
under f r is equal to

Hence the condition

f r(0, g(0; ξ); ξ) =(cid:20)1 + c1ξ

c2ξ (cid:21) + O(cid:0)|ξ|2(cid:1) .

c2 6= 0 ,

(3.5)

(3.6)

ensures that ξ is a generic unfolding parameter.

4 Periodic solutions

In this section we identify single-round periodic solutions, then show that any periodic solution
near the homoclinic corner is unstable. Let us ﬁrst summarise the assumptions given above.
Inside the neighbourhood N ⊂ M1, which contains the points (1, 0) and (0, 1), the map f is
given by (2.4) where λ and σ satisfy (2.2) and (2.3). Near (0, 1), the map f r is given by (2.12),
where g is given by (2.11) and fX and fY are given by (2.13). The parameters of (2.13) satisfy
the genericity conditions (3.2), (3.4) and (3.6).

Single-round periodic solutions

Given (x, y; ξ) near (0, 1; 0), the point f r(x, y; ξ) lies near (1, 0). Therefore, since the forward orbit
of (1, 0) limits to (0, 0) without escaping N , we have f r(x, y; ξ), f r+1(x, y; ξ), . . . , f r+k−1(x, y; ξ) ∈
N , for some k ∈ Z+, in which case

f r+k(x, y; ξ) =(fX 1k(x, y; ξ) ,

fY1k(x, y; ξ) ,

y ≤ g(x; ξ)
y ≥ g(x; ξ)

.

(4.1)

Moreover, the value of k can be made as large as we like by choosing (x, y; ξ) arbitrarily close to
(0, 1; 0).

A ﬁxed point of (4.1) is one point of a single-round periodic solution of f of period n = r + k.

By combining (2.4) and (2.13), we obtain

fS1k(x, y; ξ) =(cid:20)λk(cid:8)1 +(cid:0)a1 + bS

Multi-round periodic solutions and a lack of stability

We now consider multi-round periodic solutions. Such solutions involve several excursions far
from (x, y) = (0, 0). We anticipate the eigenvalues of a multi-round periodic solution to be those
of a product of matrices of the form (4.4). The trace of such a product is dominated its (2, 2)-
element, which has a term with powers of σ accumulated from each matrix in the product. With
a large trace, the eigenvalues of the product cannot both have modulus less than 1, in which case
the multi-round solution is unstable. Below we add rigour to this argument to produce Theorem
1.

First we clarify multi-round periodic solutions. Let N1 denote the intersection of N with the
ﬁrst quadrant (x, y > 0). We say that an “excursion” consists of r points, at least one of which
lies outside N1. A q-round periodic solution of f consists of q excursions, between each of which
is a sequence of points in N1.

Theorem 1. Suppose

{f r(0, y; 0) | 1 < y < σ} ∩ Es(0, 0; 0) = ∅ .

(4.7)

Then there exists k ∈ Z+ and ε > 0, such that for any q ∈ Z+ and any |ξ| < ε, any q-round
periodic solution of f with at least k points between each excursion is unstable.

10

First let us explain condition (4.7). The points (0, 1) and (0, σ) = f (0, 1; 0) both belong
to Eu(0, 0; 0) and map to Es(0, 0; 0) under f r. The condition (4.7) ensures that no points on
Eu(0, 0; 0) between (0, 1) and (0, σ) also map to Es(0, 0; 0) under f r. That is, f r(Eu(0, 0; 0))
and Es(0, 0; 0) have no extra intersections such as a tangency that could generate stable periodic
solutions.

Proof. For any M ∈ R, there exists ε > 0 such that for all |ξ| < ε the image under f r of any
point within M ε of (0, 1) is given by (2.12). Then given k, q ∈ Z+ and |ξ| < ε, let Γ be a q-round
periodic solution of f with at least k points between each excursion. Let (x1, y1), . . . , (xq, yq) be
the starting points of the excursions of Γ. That is, for each i = 1, . . . , q, we have (xi, yi) ∈ N1 and
f r+ki(xi, yi; ξ) = (xi+1, yi+1), where ki ≥ k is the number of points of Γ between the ith excursion
and the subsequent excursion, and (xq+1, yq+1) = (x1, y1).

For each i = 1, . . . , q, the k points of Γ prior to (xi, yi) lie in N1. Since N1 is bounded, by

Es(0, 0; ξ).

(2.4) the point (xi, yi) must be an O(cid:0)λk(cid:1) distance from Eu(0, 0; ξ). Therefore since (xi, yi) ∈ N1,
the point f r(xi, yi) is an O(cid:0)λk(cid:1) distance from f r (Eu(0, 0; ξ) ∩ N1; ξ). The k points of Γ after
f r(xi, yi) lie in N1, thus by (2.4) the point f r(xi, yi) must also be an O(cid:0)σ−k(cid:1) distance from

By (4.7) the only intersections of f r (Eu(0, 0; 0) ∩ N1; 0) and Es(0, 0; 0) are at (1, 0) and a
ﬁnite number of images and preimages of (1, 0) under (2.4). Since we are dealing with large
values of k, we can assume that each f r(xi, yi) lies near (1, 0). More speciﬁcally, with σ−k < ε we
have that f r(xi, yi) is an O(ε) distance from (1, 0). Thus (xi, yi) is an O(ε) distance from (0, 1)
and we can assume M is large enough that (xi, yi) is within a distance M ε of (0, 1).

Thus each f r+ki(xi, yi; ξ) is given by (4.1), that is equal to fSi1ki (xi, yi; ξ), where each Si is

either X or Y. Hence the eigenvalues of Γ are those of the product

By (4.4), the trace of this product is

(cid:0)DfSq1kq(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(xq ,yq;ξ) · · ·(cid:0)DfS11k1(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(x1,y1;ξ)

Here we identify BCBs of single-round periodic solutions. We then change coordinates to obtain
the border-collision normal form which we use to study the stable and unstable manifolds of the
periodic solutions.

The location and basic properties of the border-collision bifurcations

As described above, for suﬃciently large values of k the points (cid:0)xX

Note that xX
k (ξk) (because the two periodic solutions coincide at the BCB), hence our
choice of X in (5.6) does not generate an asymmetry. In these coordinates the BCB occurs at
(ˆx, ˆy; ˆξ) = (0, 0; 0). The map f r+k, as given by (4.1), becomes

This example uses positive values for both determinants which corresponds to the case that f r
is locally invertible and orientation-preserving. With instead larger values for the traces and
smaller values for the determinants, the dynamics of the map is similar but features are more
diﬃcult to discern in a single phase portrait.

The structure of the dynamics of (5.11) is independent of the magnitude of ˜ξ. This is due to
the piecewise-linear nature of the border-collision normal form [5]. It therefore suﬃces to consider
three values for ˜ξ, say −1, 0 and 1. The BCB occurs at ˜ξ = 0. With ˜ξ = 1, the map (5.11)
with (5.12) has no bounded invariant sets. Fig. 7 shows a phase portrait of (5.11) with (5.12)

6 Discussion

Summary

This paper is the ﬁrst to provide the generic unfolding of a homoclinic corner. Theorem 1 states
that with parameter values suﬃciently close to the homoclinic corner (within ε) there cannot exist
a stable periodic solution involving many (at least k) consecutive points in a neighbourhood of the
saddle each time the solution enters this neighbourhood. Typical nearby forward orbits therefore
either approach an aperiodic attractor, or diverge. The practical eﬀect of a homoclinic corner
may be that of a crisis, as in Fig. 2, where a chaotic attractor is destroyed.

A sequence of BCBs, ξn, at which pairs of single-round periodic solutions are created, limits to
a homoclinic corner, see Theorem 2. This is analogous to the sequence of saddle-node bifurcations
near a homoclinic tangency of a smooth map, and the two sequences satisfy the same scaling law.
The dynamics local to each BCB is described by a piecewise-linear continuous map which we
transformed into the border-collision normal form (5.11). From this we showed that the stable and
unstable manifolds of the single-round periodic solutions have transverse intersections, Theorem
3. At each BCB an invariant Cantor set is created on which the dynamics is chaotic. In contrast,
the dynamics local to each saddle-node bifurcation near a homoclinic tangency of a smooth map

15

is well approximated by a two-dimensional quadratic map [1, 18], which can be transformed into
the H´enon map [24, 25].

The calculations given above assume λσ < 1. With instead λσ > 1, the roles of λ and 1
σ
are reversed. Pairs of single-round periodic solutions are created in BCBs with the alternate
scaling law, ξn = Cλn + O(σ−n) + O(λ2n). But again both periodic solutions are saddles and the
dynamics near the BCBs is given by (5.11).

Reduction to a skew tent map

Since the determinants δX
approximated by the one-dimensional map

k and δY

k in (5.11) are small, the ˜x-values of iterates of (5.11) are well

˜x 7→(τ X

k ˜x + ˜ξ ,
k ˜x + ˜ξ ,
τ Y

˜x ≤ 0
˜x ≥ 0

.

(6.1)

This is a steep skew tent map. The analogous one-dimensional map for a homoclinic tangency
is quadratic. Each BCB can therefore be viewed as the contraction into a single point of the
well known bifurcation sequence of quadratic maps (a saddle-node bifurcation, a period-doubling
cascade to chaos, windows of periodicity and bifurcations associated with the chaotic regime,
and ﬁnally the loss of a local attractor in a homoclinic bifurcation). Arbitrarily steep quadratic
maps can be renormalised, but the piecewise-linear nature of (6.1) inhibits this manner of renor-
malisation.

Homoclinic corners in higher-dimensional maps

For a homoclinic tangency to a saddle ﬁxed point in a high-dimensional smooth map, only the
slowest stable and unstable directions related to the ﬁxed point are important for understanding
the dynamics close to the tangency [26, 27]. This is because typical forward and backward orbits
approach the ﬁxed point tangent to the slow manifolds. If the eigenvalues corresponding to the
slowest stable and unstable directions are both real, generically the limiting dynamics is governed
by a one-dimensional quadratic map, as in the two-dimensional case. Otherwise one or both slow
directions correspond to complex eigenvalues, and there are a total of four diﬀerent limiting maps
that arise in generic situations [28].

For homoclinic corners in higher dimensions we expect there to be a similar set of limiting
maps. As with (6.1), we expect that these maps are piecewise-linear but involve arbitrarily large
coeﬃcients and for this reason lack attracting invariant sets.

Outlook for future studies

In addition to accommodating higher dimensions, several problems remain for future work. The
codimension-two homoclinic corner of Fig. 1 appears to be a limit point of mode-locking regions.
This phenomenon is evident in a similar codimension-two scenario for a PWS discontinuous map
[29] and could be explained by a generalisation of the unfolding performed here. It would also be
helpful to study homoclinic corners as the limit of homoclinic tangencies by smoothing the map
(1.1) so that we can understand how the stability of periodic solutions is lost in the nonsmooth
limit.
