Constructions of exotic actions on product

manifolds with an asymmetric factor

Zbigniew B laszczyk, Marek Kaluba∗

Abstract

We investigate transformation groups of manifolds of the form M ×
S n, where M is an asymmetric manifold, i.e. a manifold which does
not admit any non-trivial action of a ﬁnite group. In particular, we
prove that for n = 2 there existss an inﬁnite family of pairwise distinct
non-diagonal eﬀective circle actions on such products. A similar result
holds for actions of cyclic groups of prime order. On the other hand, if
M is one of the “almost asymmetric” manifolds considered previously
by V. Puppe and M. Kreck, then every free circle action on M × S 1
turns out to be equivalent to a diagonal one.

Introduction

A ubiquitous problem in transformation groups is to decide whether certain
groups can act in a speciﬁc manner on a given class of spaces. We investigate
an instance of this situation in the context of diagonal actions on manifolds
given as Cartesian products.

Let X and Y be smooth G-manifolds. Diagonal action ∆ on the product

X × Y is given by the formula

∆(cid:0)g, (x, y)(cid:1) = (gx, gy) for g ∈ G, x ∈ X and y ∈ Y .

More generally, an action φ : G × (X × Y ) → X × Y is said to be a product
action provided that φ is smoothly conjugate to a diagonal action, i.e. there
exists a G-equivariant diﬀeomorphism f : X × Y → X × Y satisfying f ◦ φ =
∆ ◦ (idG × f ).

The starting point for our work is the following question: How to dis-
tinguish whether an arbitrarily given G-action on X × Y is a product one?
Note that a G-action on X × Y is diagonal if and only if both projections
X × Y → X and X × Y → Y are G-equivariant maps. The Borsuk–Ulam
theorem and its many generalizations provide insight into how diﬃcult tack-
ling a problem of this type might be.

Intuitively, products of manifolds with high degree of symmetry should
admit plenty of exotic1 actions.
Indeed, work on the rank conjecture for
products of spheres shows that actions on products can be very complicated,
see e.g. Hambleton– ¨Unl¨u [6]. However, as degree of symmetry of one of the
manifolds in the product decreases, there might be a “threshold dimension”
below which all actions become equivalent to product ones. As spheres have
the highest possible degree of symmetry (Eisenhart [5]), the following seems
to be a very natural testing example.

Let M be an asymmetric manifold, i.e. a manifold which does
not admit any non-trivial action of a ﬁnite group. What are the
possible actions of G on M × Sn, depending on G and n?

In fact there is a strong sentiment expressed, among others, by Raymond
and Schultz [4], Kreck [10] and Puppe [15] that “most” manifolds are asym-
metric. On the other hand, Pawa lowski [13] challenges (teasingly) this view
by suggesting that there should be at least as many symmetric manifolds
as asymmetric ones. Indeed, a product of an asymmetric manifold with one
that has symmetries yields a manifold that clearly again has symmetries.

The purpose of this note is to shed some light on the inﬂuence of that
second factor on symmetries of the whole product. In particular, we prove
that for every asymmetric manifold M there exist smooth actions of the
circle group (or a cyclic group of prime order) on M × S 2 which do not
come solely from actions on S 2, and a similar result follows for involutions
on M × S 1 (Theorems 1 and 2, respectively). This stands in contrast to
free actions of the circle group on a class of 7-manifolds given as M × S 1,
where M is an “almost asymmetric” manifold (see Section 2): we show
that all such actions are smoothly equivalent to diagonal ones (Theorem 4).
We also discuss a possible approach to the problem of detecting orientation
preserving free involutions on M × S 1 (Corollary 9).

Notation. We work in the smooth category. In particular, all manifolds

1We follow Adem and Smith [1] and call an action “exotic” when it is not equivalent

to a product action.

and actions are taken to be smooth. Furthermore, unless otherwise stated,
all manifolds are assumed to be compact.

2 Asymmetric and “almost asymmetric” manifolds

A closed manifold is said to be asymmetric if it does not admit any non-tri-
vial action of a ﬁnite group. Such manifolds appear as soon as in dimension
3 in the shape of bundles over the circle with ﬁbre an orientable surface of
genus at least 3 (Raymond–Tollefson [16]). Every 3-dimensional asymmetric
manifold is also aspherical, i.e., it has a contractible universal cover. Borel [3]
provided a suﬃcient criterion for an aspherical manifold M to be asymmetric:
its π1 is required to have trivial center and torsion-free outer automorphism

group Out(cid:0)π1(M )(cid:1).

Non-aspherical asymmetric manifolds appear as soon as in dimension 4
(see Bloomberg [2]). Curiously enough though, all of known examples have
non-trivial fundamental groups: the existence of a simply connected asym-
metric manifold is an open problem.

Remark. Keep in mind that we are discussing smooth manifolds. The
simply connected 6-manifolds shown to be asymmetric by Kreck [10, 11] are
topological and non-smoothable.

Let us now brieﬂy describe the “least symmetric” simply connected man-

ifolds known at present. Consider a map f : Z6 → Z given by

f (x1, . . . , x6) = 6(cid:0)x1x2

4 − x2

1x4 + x2x2

4 + x2x2
3x6 + x3x2

4 − x2
6 + x2

2x5 + x2x2
5x6 + x5x2

+ x4x5x6 + x4x5x6 + x3

4 + x3

6(cid:1).

The map f determines a trilinear symmetric form, hence also a cup product-
like structure

µ : Z6 ⊕ Z6 ⊕ Z6 → Z.

It follows from classiﬁcation of 6-manifolds due to Wall [18] that there exists
an inﬁnite family of simply connected spin 6-manifolds Mµ such that for
any M ∈ Mµ, the cup product on H ∗(M ; Z) is prescribed by the form above.
All such M ’s are distinguished by the ﬁrst Pontryagin class. An appropriate
choice of this class allows to exclude existence of non-trivial actions of any
ﬁnite group on M :

3

Theorem (Puppe [14]). There exists an inﬁnite family MAs ⊂ Mµ of
manifolds with the property that any M ∈ MAs does not admit any non-
trivial action of a ﬁnite group, with the possible exception of an orientation
reversing involution.

Recently Olbermann [12] showed that these manifolds in fact admit smooth
involutions with 3-dimensional ﬁxed point sets.

In what follows we will frequently refer to manifolds from the family

MAs as almost asymmetric.

3 Exotic actions

3.1 Constructing exotic actions on M × S 2

Theorem 1. Let G = S 1 or G = Z/p, p a prime. If M is an m-dimensional
asymmetric manifold for m > 3, then there exists an eﬀective exotic G-action
on M × S 2.

We provide a proof for G = Z/p. The case of G = S 1 is analogous. Our

approach was inspired by Hsiang [7].

Proof. Recall that any G-action on S 2 is linear, hence every non-trivial
product G-action on M × S 2 has the ﬁxed point set, if non-empty (which
can happen if p = 2), diﬀeomorphic to M ⊔ M . Thus in order to prove the
theorem, it suﬃces to construct a G-action on M × S 2 with a ﬁxed point
set diﬀerent from M ⊔ M .

Consider a non-simply connected m-dimensional homology sphere Σ
which bounds a contractible manifold X (see Kervaire [9, Theorem 3]). Take
any non-trivial orthogonal 2-dimensional G-representation V and equip the
product X × D(V ) with a diagonal G-action by setting

g·(x, y) 7→ (x, gy) for any g ∈ G, x ∈ X and y ∈ D(V ).

Note that X is contractible and ∂(cid:0)X × D(V )(cid:1) is simply connected by the

Seifert–van Kampen theorem. Since m + 3 > 6, the h-cobordism theorem
yields a diﬀeomorphism

X × D(V ) ∼= Dm+3.

The action restricted to the boundary sphere Sm+2 has the following two
properties:

(1) (Sm+2)G = Σ, and

4

(2) the tangential G-module at any point x ∈ Σ ⊂ Sm+2 is isomorphic to

Rm ⊕ V .

To conclude the proof, identify M × S 2 ∼= M × S(V ⊕ R), choose a ﬁxed
point y ∈ M × {(0, 0, 1)} and consider the equivariant connected sum along
disk G-neighbourhoods of x and y:

Sm+2#(cid:0)M ×S(V ⊕ R)(cid:1) ∼= M × S 2.

Clearly, the induced action on the right hand side realises M ⊔ (M #Σ) as
the ﬁxed point set. But M and M #Σ have non-isomorphic fundamental
groups, e.g. by the Grushko–von Neumann theorem.

Theorem 2. If M is an m-dimensional asymmetric manifold for m > 4,
then there exist exotic involutions on M × S 1.

Proof. When G = Z/2, one can take V to be the sign representation, and
the proof then follows exactly as above, although M has to be at least 4-
dimensional in order to comply to assumptions of the h-cobordism theorem.

Remark. For a plausible connection between representations and the exis-
tence of exotic actions see the discussion at the end of the paper. We also
emphasise that the above construction produces non-equivalent actions for
diﬀerent choices of the ﬁxed point set Σ.

The following general strategy for detecting exotic actions can be ex-

tracted from the proof of Theorem 1.

Proposition 3. Let M a manifold such that the ﬁxed point set M G is
connected for any G-action and let H be a non-trivial closed subgroup of G.
If G acts on M × Sn, n ≥ 1, with the H-ﬁxed point set

for X not homotopy equivalent to Y , then the G-action on M × Sn is exotic.

(cid:0)M × Sn(cid:1)H ∼= X ⊔ Y

Proof. Since all subgroups H ⊆ S 1 are normal, the argument for G = S 1
may be restricted to actions of S 1/H ∼= S 1, and those clearly have non-empty
ﬁxed point sets.

By Smith Theory, the ﬁxed point set of any G-action on Sn is either
a mod p homology sphere (when G = Z/p), or an integral homology sphere
(when G = S 1), say Σ. Therefore the ﬁxed point set of a product G-action
on M × Sn is equal to M G × Σ. This space is either connected or homotopy
equivalent to M G ⊔ M G, and the conclusion follows.

Remark. The results of this section carry over to topological and piecewise
-linear categories.

4 Free actions on M × S1

Throughout this section M ∈ MAs. Recall that H ∗(M ; Z) is freely gener-
ated by elements of degree 2.

Free circle action on M × S 1

Theorem 4. Let M ∈ MAs. Every orientation preserving free S 1-action
on M × S 1 is a product action.

Note that the product S 1-action on M × S 1 is an action equivalent to the
one given by

g(x, z) 7→ (x, g · z) for any g, z ∈ S 1 and x ∈ M ,

where · is the complex multiplication.

Proof. Denote by X the orbit space (M × S 1)/S 1. We will make use of the
fact that a free S 1-action on M × S 1 yields a ﬁbre bundle over X:

ξ

def.

= (cid:0)S 1 → M × S 1 → X(cid:1).

Any such bundle is determined by its ﬁrst Chern class c1(ξ).

Assume for now that c1(ξ) = 0. Then ξ is the trivial S 1-bundle over X,

and the following diagram commutes (up to homotopy).

A due explanation of the diagram follows. The total space of the trivial
S 1-bundle over X in the lower row may be identiﬁed with M × S 1. As
will be proved in a moment, X is simply connected, and hence the diagram
yields a homotopy equivalence M → X. Our aim is to improve this map
to a diﬀeomorphism: since the action is a product one and every S 1-action
on M is trivial, any diﬀeomorphism f : M → X commutes with πG. Thus
f × id would provide the equivalence of actions in the upper and lower rows.
This reduces the proof of Theorem 4 to the following two claims.

6

Claim 1. The ﬁrst Chern class c1(ξ) is trivial.

Claim 2. The equivalence M → X can be improved to a diﬀeomorphism.

Proof of Claim 1. Recall that M is a simply connected 6-dimensional man-
ifold with free cohomology generated in the second gradation. Inspection
of the long exact sequence of ξ shows that π1(X) is either trivial or ﬁnite
cyclic. Since G acts preserving orientation, we can consider the Leray–Serre
spectral sequence

The diﬀerential d2 : E0,1

is given by the multiplication by c1(ξ).
Assume that c1 6= 0 and set d2(a) = c 6= 0. We claim that c is a generator
of the torsion part of the second cohomology of X,

2 → E2,0

2

Tor(cid:0)H 2(X)(cid:1) ∼= H1(X) ∼= Z/k.

if c were not a generator, then the generator would survive to
Indeed,
E3 = E∞ and H 2(M × S 1) would contain a torsion element, which gives a
contradiction.

By multiplicative properties of the spectral sequence, we have

d2(c ⊗ a) = c2,

so we may push c up to c3 ⊗ a ∈ E6,1
2 . Now observe that c3 ⊗ a survives
to E∞, hence also to H 7(M × S 1), as there is no diﬀerential to kill it. But
H 7(M × S 1) is torsion free, thus

d2(c2 ⊗ a) = c3 = 0.

7

Now suppose that c2⊗a survives to E∞. Passing from E∞ to H 5(M ×S 1)

requires solving an extension problem

0 → E 4,1

2 → H 5(M × S 1) → (cid:4) → 0.

But H 5(M × S 1) contains no torsion subgroup, hence already c2 ⊗ a had
had to vanish. We may repeat the same argument once again to arrive at
the conclusion that a ⌣ c = 0, simultaneously proving that c = c1(ξ) = 0
and that X is simply connected.

Proof of Claim 2. Thanks to equivalence of bundles, we already have a
diﬀeomorphism M × S 1 → X × S 1. Lift it to the map of universal covers

belongs to X × [−a, a] for some a ∈ R. Write A for a connected component

ϕ : M × R → X × R. Since ϕ(cid:0)M × {0}(cid:1) is compact in X × R, its image
of (X × R) − ϕ(cid:0)M × {0}(cid:1) and note that

W = A ∩(cid:0)X × (−∞, a](cid:1)

is a connected manifold with boundary ∂W ∼= X ⊔ ϕ(M ). The inclusions
X ֒→ W and ϕ(M ) ֒→ W are homotopy equivalences. Since π1(M ) = 0, the
h-cobordism theorem yields a diﬀeomorphism M → X.

This ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 4.

Detecting non-product involutions on M × S 1

Recall that two involutions τ1, τ2 : X → X are homotopically (topologically)
conjugate if there exists a homotopy equivalence (homeomorphism) h : X →
X such that τ1 ◦ h = h ◦ τ2.

Theorem 5. Free involutions on M × S 1 are homotopically (topologically)
conjugate if and only if the respective orbit spaces are homotopy equivalent
(homeomorphic).

Once we prove that the fundamental group of the orbit space of a free
involution on M × S 1 is inﬁnite cyclic, the argument will carry over directly
from Jahren and Kwasik [8, Section 4].
In order to do so, we need the
following:

Lemma 6. Let p be a prime. There is no free Zp-action on M × R.

Proof. (preliminary step) For a preliminary step, assume that the action
is additionally cohomologically trivial and consider the Leray–Serre spectral
sequence

of the ﬁbration M × R → (M × R)/Zp → K(Zp, 1).

Recall that the cohomology groups H ∗(M ; Z) are trivial in odd dimen-
2 vanish for odd t. Furthermore, since H ∗(M ; Z)

sions, so that the groups Es,t
are ﬁnitely-generated free abelian in even dimensions and

H k(Zp; Z) =

k = 0,
Z,
0,
k is odd,
Zp, k is even

it follows from the Universal Coeﬃcients Theorem that the groups Es,t
2 van-
ish also for odd s. Consequently, the spectral sequence collapses at the
E2-page. This implies that the cohomological dimension of (M × R)/Zp if
inﬁnite, which clearly is impossible.

(p odd) Now observe that if p is odd, then the action is necessarily ori-
entation preserving. However, in view of Puppe [15, Theorem 4], the ring
H ∗(M ; Z) does not admit any non-trivial orientation preserving automor-
phisms of ﬁnite order. Consequenly, Zp cannot act freely on M × R if p is
odd.

(p even) It remains to deal with the cohomologically non-trivial case
for p = 2. The algebra H ∗(M ; Z) admits an orientation reversing involution,
given by the identity on H 0 and H 4, and by multiplication by (−1) on H 2
and H 6. Note that the composition of two orientation reversing involutions
on H ∗(M ; Z) is an orientation preserving involution, hence it is trivial, as
explained above. Therefore the involution turns out to be unique (see Puppe
[15, p. 90]) and accounts for the only possible twisted local coordinate
system in the spectal sequence (⋆).

Recall that

H k(Z2;eZ) =(0,

k is even,
Z2, k is odd,

where eZ denotes the non-trivial Z2-module structure on Z, and

H i(G, M ⊕ M ′) ∼= H i(G, M ) ⊕ H i(G, M ′)

for any group G and any G-modules M , M ′. The spectral sequence (⋆) may
not immediately collapse due to shifts on E ∗,2
coming from the
local coeﬃcients.

and E ∗,6

However, a non-zero diﬀerential in the spectral sequence would deﬁne
a non-zero derivation of of H ∗(M ; Z2), which is not possible by Puppe [15,
Theorem 1]. Hence E ∗,∗
∞ , which in turn implies that the cohomologi-
cal dimension of the manifold (M × R)/Z2 is inﬁnite.

Corollary 7. If a ﬁnite group G acts freely on M × S 1, then π1(cid:0)(M ×
S 1)/G(cid:1) ∼= Z.

Proof. Denote by X the orbit space (M × S 1)/G. Since π1(M × S 1) ∼= Z,
the long exact sequence of homotopy groups of the cover M × S 1 → X gives
rise to the short exact sequence

0 → Z → π1(X) → G → 1,

(♠)

that is π1(X) is a virtually cyclic group2.

Furthermore, the orbit space X is universally covered by M × R. There-
fore π1(X) acts as a group of deck transformations on M × R. By Lemma 6,
π1(X) is torsion-free. But the only torsion-free virtually cyclic group is
the inﬁnite cyclic group (see Scott and Wall [17, Theorem 5.12]), hence
π1(X) ∼= Z.

As a consequence, we obtain:

Corollary 8. If a ﬁnite group G acts freely on M × S 1, then G is cyclic.

Proof. The short exact sequence (♠) assumes the form

0 → Z → Z → G → 1

and the conclusion follows.

Now observe that since M does not admit any non-trivial orientation
preserving involutions, a diagonal involution on M × S 1 is necessarily trivial
on the ﬁrst coordinate. Therefore the orbit space of an involution on M × S 1
which is both diagonal and free is homeomorphic to M × S 1. This provides
a criterion for deciding whether a free orientation-preserving involution is a
product one or not:

Corollary 9. An orientation preserving free involution on M × S 1 is homo-
topically (topologically) conjugate to a diagonal one if and only if the orbit
space is homotopy equivalent (homeomorphic) to M × S 1.

Let us conclude with a few remarks on the expected behaviour of actions
on product manifolds. The proof of Theorem 1 suggests that the “threshold
dimension” mentioned in the introduction is intimately connected with the
dimension of the ﬁxed point set. Observe that as soon as we grasp the ﬁxed

2A group is virtually cyclic whenever it contains a cyclic subgroup of ﬁnite index.

10

point set (with its normal bundle) of a locally linear G-action, we can modify
the action to a non-product one.

We believe that this relates directly to the following number. Let n(G)
denote the minimal dimension of a non-trivial irreducible representation of
G.

Conjecture. Let G be a ﬁnite group, M an asymmetric manifold.
If n < n(G), then any G-action on M × Sn is a product one.

This would also prove that any ﬁxed point free S 1-action on M × S 1 is the
product action. As the proof of Theorem 4 suggests, the vanishing of the
ﬁrst Chern class should be a more general fact and applied to all asymmetric
manifolds with torsion-free cohomology in even degrees. We believe that any
free Z/p-action on M ×S 1 is equivalent to a product one, for every odd prime
p and every M ∈ MAs.
