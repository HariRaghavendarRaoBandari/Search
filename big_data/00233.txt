Abstract. We consider one-dimensional propagation of quantum light in the
presence of a block of material, with a full account of dispersion and absorption. The
electromagnetic zero-point energy for some frequencies is suppressed by the block below
the free-space value, while for other frequencies it is increased. We also calculate the
regularized (Casimir) zero-point energy at each frequency and ﬁnd that it too is less
than the free-space value (zero) for some frequencies. The total Casimir energy is
positive.

1. Introduction

The most fascinating aspect of the Casimir eﬀect is that it attributes a physical
signiﬁcance to the vacuum zero-point energy of electromagnetic radiation [1]. This
is all the more surprising as electromagnetic zero-point energy seems initially to be
a theoretical malfunction, a spurious divergence that should be ignored. An inﬁnite
zero-point energy for quantum ﬁelds is a simple consequence of their description
as a continuum of quantum harmonic oscillators, where all oscillation frequencies
may occur [1, 2]. Casimir theory attributes a real existence to a ﬁnite part of
the electromagnetic zero-point energy and pressure, a part that is determined by
macroscopic objects and that in turn exerts forces on those objects [3, 4, 5, 6,
7].
Experimental conﬁrmation of Casimir forces allows us to take seriously an
electromagnetic vacuum state whose energy density and pressure have a spatial
and frequency structure that is determined by the electromagnetic susceptibilities of
macroscopic materials. But the detailed structure of the electromagnetic vacuum state
is not usually described in Casimir calculations because only the total vacuum energy,
or total vacuum pressure at material boundaries, is required to ﬁnd the forces. Moreover
the sum over all frequency contributions to the force is invariably carried out as a sum
over imaginary frequencies, which obscures the spectrum of the vacuum state since each
imaginary-frequency component has contributions from all real frequencies. Here we
study the electromagnetic vacuum state in the simplest non-trivial case and show that

individual modes of light can have zero-point energies that are decreased by coupling to
macroscopic materials.

Casimir forces are intimately connected to thermal radiation [3, 4, 5] and our
approach here is similar to investigations of the eﬀect of material boundaries on the
thermal spectrum [8, 9]. Also closely related are studies of the spatial variation in the
local electromagnetic density of states caused by materials, an eﬀect that can be probed
by spontaneous emission [10, 11, 12, 13]. In those investigations, it is the properties of
light outside the materials, including close to the boundaries, that are relevant. Our
interest here however is in the energy density of each mode throughout space, which
crucially includes the regions inside the materials.

Our work is also motivated by the developing subject of nanomechanical
systems [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. The physics of such systems may be modelled as quantum
oscillators that are damped by coupling to reservoirs representing the environment.
Although the link to nanomechanical systems is not often made, the quantum theory
of macroscopic electromagnetism is also a theory of quantum damped harmonic
oscillators and can be formulated exactly as a quantized theory of light coupled to
a reservoir [19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25]. Results for the behavior of quantum light modes in
macroscopic electromagnetism are therefore instructive for studies of nanomechanical
systems.

Figure 1. A block of material of length L with electric permittivity ε(ω) and magnetic
permeability µ(ω). The surrounding region is vacuum, written as the vacuum limit
ε2(ω) → 1 of another material. We consider light linearly polarized in the y-direction
and propagating in the x-direction perpendicular to the block faces at x = 0 and x = L.

2. Set-up

We consider a block of material of electric permittivity ε(ω) and magnetic permeability
µ(ω) (see Fig. 1). The block has boundaries at x = 0 and x = L and is surrounded by
vacuum, but for technical reasons (see below) the vacuum region is represented as the
vacuum limit ε2(ω) → 1 of a diﬀerent dielectric. Our interest is in the eﬀect of this block
on the quantum vacuum state of light, and to simplify the analysis as much as possible
we consider only light modes linearly polarized in the y-direction and propagating in
the x-direction. The set-up is therefore essentially one-dimensional and we treat it as
such. The input and output modes in this arrangement are analysed in [26].

The macroscopic Maxwell equations for light interacting with an arbitrary
inhomogeneous material whose dielectric functions obey the Kramers-Kronig relations
can be formulated exactly as closed system of electromagnetic ﬁelds coupled to a
reservoir (see [25], for example). By quantizing this system and diagonalizing its
Hamiltonian [25] one obtains the following expression for the electric-ﬁeld operator in
our case of interest, where the general result is specialized to one polarization and to
the case where both propagation and material inhomogeneity are in the x-direction:

In our case the material is piecewise homogeneous and the solution of (3) is well known

the electric-ﬁeld operator (1) and the magnetic-ﬁeld operator (which points in the z-

of the dielectric functions in (1), it is necessary to consider vacuum as the limit of a

In the absence of materials, the ﬁeld operators for one-dimensional propagation
can be decomposed into independent left- and right-going modes of each frequency. In
our case, reﬂections from the block boundaries couple the left- and right-going modes.
Nevertheless, in the vacuum regions outside the block the ﬁeld operators and their
algebra still take a relatively simple form (see also [26]). In the region to the right of
the block (x > L) the electric-ﬁeld operator (1) can be written

3. Vacuum-state ﬁeld uncertainties

The electromagnetic vacuum state is deﬁned by ˆCe(x, ω)|0(cid:105) = 0 and ˆCm(x, ω)|0(cid:105) = 0,
which imply ˆa±(x, ω)|0(cid:105) = 0 for the mode operators in (4). It is then straightforward
to calculate the zero-point uncertainties of the electric (∆E(x)) and magnetic (∆B(x))
ﬁelds in the region to the right of the block (x > L) using the algebra (5) and (6):

[∆E(x)]2 = (cid:104)0|[ ˆE(x, t)]2|0(cid:105) =
[∆B(x)]2 = (cid:104)0|[ ˆB(x, t)]2|0(cid:105) =

dω ω [1 − |ζ| sin (2k0x + φζ)] ,(11)
dω ω [1 + |ζ| sin (2k0x + φζ)] . (12)
These ﬁeld uncertainties oscillate with distance from the block boundary. The electric-
ﬁeld uncertainty (11) can be probed by measuring spontaneous emission at diﬀerent
positions (though in general modes for all angles of incidence on the block need to be
included) [10, 11, 12, 13].

would be expected as the extension to the quantum vacuum of the classical results of

can also be obtained from the general expressions (13) and (14), as the Green function

4. Vacuum-state energy

When macroscopic electromagnetism is formulated as a closed system of electromagnetic
ﬁelds interacting with a reservoir, the total energy-density operator follows from
time-translation symmetry and Noether’s theorem [27]. The total energy is that
of the electromagnetic ﬁelds and the reservoir,
including contributions from the
coupling between the two [27]. For the ground state and thermal equilibrium, the
electromagnetic part of the energy can be deﬁned using the Hamiltonian of mean
force [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. The resulting electromagnetic energy is the total energy
minus the energy the reservoir would have if it alone were present (for the vacuum
state this is also the expectation value of the Hamiltonian of mean force). Deﬁning the
energy in this manner gives the same answer for Casimir forces as obtained by using
the electromagnetic stress tensor [27]. In our case of one polarization and propagation
in the x-direction, the electromagnetic energy per unit length ρ(x) of the vacuum state
in an arbitrary inhomogeneous material is [27]

where ∆E(x) and ∆B(x) are the vacuum-state ﬁeld uncertainties given by (13) and

Using (21), we obtain the zero-point electromagnetic energy per unit length in the
presence of the block. In the region to the right of the block (x > L), (11) and (12)
together with ε(x, ω) = µ(x, ω) = 1 in (21) give

which is exactly the (diverging) zero-point energy per unit length in the absence of the
block. This is also the result in the region to the left of the block (x < 0). Thus,
although the electric and magnetic ﬁeld uncertainties outside the block are aﬀected by
its presence, this material dependence cancels out in the energy per unit length outside
the block. It should be noted that this cancelation only happens for modes propagating
perpendicular to the block boundaries. As our interest is in how the block alters the
electromagnetic zero-point energy (of x-propagating modes), we see that only the energy
inside the block matters. Inserting (19) and (20) in (21) and putting ε(x, ω) = ε(ω),
µ(x, ω) = µ(ω), we ﬁnd the energy per unit length inside the block (0 < x < L).
Integration from x = 0 to x = L then gives the zero-point energy E in the block, and

where α and β are again (17) and (18) and we have deﬁned the spectral energy W (ω),
i.e. the energy per unit frequency. The zero-point energy (23) of x-propagating modes
contained in the block diverges because of the integral over mode frequencies, whereas
the spectral energy (24) is ﬁnite for each frequency. (If we considered all modes then
the spectral energy would diverge because, for each frequency, there is an integral over
modes incident at all angles to the block boundaries and this integral diverges [35].)

For the modes we are considering our results show that, for each frequency, the
block causes a ﬁnite change in the zero-point energy. The only change in the zero-point
energy occurs inside the block, where modes with a small frequency spread ∆ω around ω
have a zero-point energy ∆ωW (ω), whereas without the block their energy in this region
would be ∆ωωL/(2πc) (the spectral energy per unit length of empty space is, from (22),
ω/(2πc)). Thus W (ω) − ωL/(2πc) quantiﬁes the (ﬁnite) change in zero-point energy

for each frequency. This ﬁnite result at each frequency is obtained without having to
regularize any diverging quantities. Because the total zero-point energy diverges (even
for the limited set of modes we consider), regularization is needed to compute ﬁnite
Casimir energies and forces (see below). Regularization changes the zero-point energy
attributed to each mode, but the change in zero-point energy caused by the block is
ﬁnite for each mode both before and after regularization.

The zero-point energy (23) contains a diverging part Ebulk that is independent of
the block boundaries, i.e. it is L times the energy per unit length in an inﬁnite material
of refractive index n:

(The zero-point energy per unit length in an inﬁnite homogeneous material diﬀers
from (22) by having a factor d(ωn)/dω in the integrand, as follows from (21).)
In
Casimir theory, all such diverging bulk quantities are dropped, and only the ﬁnite
quantities that remain are taken as physically signiﬁcant [3, 4, 5]. The rationale for this

Damped vacuum states of light

regularization procedure is that only macroscopic material inhomogeneities (smooth or
discontinuous changes in the dielectric functions) give physical meaningful contributions
to electromagnetic zero-point quantities [5]. A notable feature of the regularization is
that it involves dropping diﬀerent inﬁnite quantities at diﬀerent points of space (the
diverging bulk contribution at any point depends on the values of the dielectric functions
at that point) [5]. Thus, to obtain the Casimir energy EC of the modes considered here,
in the presence of the block, we drop the purely bulk quantity (22) outside the block
and remove (25) from (23), i.e. EC = E − Ebulk, so that

For a metal we use a Drude-model approximation for gold, namely (28) with ω0 = 0,
Ω = 8.45 eV and γ = 0.047 eV. Figure 2 shows the zero-point energy per unit frequency
W (ω) contained in the block, for block lengths L = 1 µm (5.068 eV−1) and L = 10 µm
(50.68 eV−1), together with the free-space value ωL/(2πc) of W (ω) (the spectral energy
in the same spatial region without the block). We see that the block lowers the zero-point
energies for frequencies less than the plasma frequency (ω (cid:46) Ω), compared to the free-
space values. (Recall that spatial regions outside the block do not contribute to changing
the zero-point energy of the modes.) Above the plasma frequency the zero-point energies
are larger than the free-space values. The Casimir energy per unit frequency WC(ω)
of the block is shown in Fig. 3, for block lengths L = 1 µm and L = 10 µm. Above

the plasma frequency the Casimir energy of the modes oscillates between positive and
negative values, these oscillations in frequency becoming more rapid as L increases. The
free-space value of WC(ω) is of course zero, so negative values of WC(ω) correspond to
a decrease of the regularized zero-point energy below that of empty space. The total
Casimir energy (26) is positive for all L.

For a non-metallic dielectric we use (28) with ω0 = 5 eV, Ω = 8 eV and γ = 0.5 eV.
Figures 4 and 5 show results for this dielectric that correspond to Figs. 2 and 3 for
the metal. From Fig. 4 we see that the zero-point energy of a range of frequencies is
suppressed below the free-space value. The real part of the permittivity goes through
zero at ω ≈ 5 eV and ω ≈ 10 eV, and the damping of the zero-point energy occurs
between these two frequencies. For parameters such that the real part of the permittivity
(28) is positive for all frequencies, the decrease of zero-point energy below the free-space
value occurs for frequencies around the resonance ω ≈ ω0. Figure 5 shows that the
Casimir energy per unit frequency WC(ω) of the block oscillates between positive and
negative values. As in the case of the metal, the total Casimir energy (26) is positive
for all L.

The eﬀect of magnetic permeability and of negative refraction can also be
investigated. Again, it is found that zero-point energy is suppressed below the free-
space value for some frequencies and increased for others, while the Casimir energy per
unit frequency oscillates between positive and negative values with the total Casimir
energy being positive.

6. Conclusions

In quantum optics the electromagnetic vacuum (zero-point) ﬁeld uncertainty of a subset
of modes is given an experimental meaning through balanced homodyne detection [2] and
spontaneous emission [10]. In such considerations the issue of regularization of the total
(diverging) zero-point ﬁeld uncertainty can be avoided, since the zero-point quantities for
a single mode, or for a single frequency outside materials, are ﬁnite. Here we considered
quantum optics in the presence of a block of material, taking full account of dispersion
and absorption. We showed that the material decreases the zero-point energy of some
modes, while increasing that of others. When the zero-point modes are regularized so
that the total (Casimir) zero-point energy is ﬁnite and zero in the absence of the block,
then certain modes have negative Casmir energy while others have positive. The total

Casimir energy is positive. The physics considered here is closely connected to that of
nanomechanical systems, because it is nothing more than quantum damped oscillators.
Nanomechanical systems can be modelled using a Hamiltonian that diﬀers from that of
macroscopic electromagnetism in having one or more oscillators coupled to the reservoir
instead of the inﬁnite number of oscillators of the electromagnetic ﬁeld [36, 37]. In the
simplest case of a single quantum damped oscillator similar modiﬁcations of zero-point
energy can occur [36].
