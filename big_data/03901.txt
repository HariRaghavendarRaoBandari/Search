Cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebras are cyclotomic quiver

Hecke algebras

Abstract

We prove that cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebras of type A are cyclotomic quiver
Hecke algebras and we give an explicit isomorphism with its inverse, using a similar result
of Brundan and Kleshchev on cyclotomic Hecke algebras. The quiver we use is given by
disjoint copies of cyclic quivers.

Introduction

Iwahori–Hecke algebras appeared ﬁrst in the context of ﬁnite Chevalley groups, as centralizer
algebras of the induced representation from the trivial representation on a Borel subgroup.
Since then, both their structure and their representation theory have been intensively studied.
In particular, they have been deﬁned independently as deformations of the group algebra
of ﬁnite Coxeter groups. Further, connections with many other objects and theories have
been established (this includes the theory of quantum groups, knot theory, etc.). Many
variations and generalisations of the “classical” Iwahori–Hecke algebras have yet been deﬁned.
Among these, the following ones will catch our interest in this paper: Ariki–Koike algebras,
Yokonuma–Hecke algebras and ﬁnally cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebras.

In their seminal paper, Ariki and Koike [ArKo] introduced and studied generalisations of
Iwahori–Hecke algebras of type A and B: the so called Ariki–Koike algebras. It turns out that
these algebras can be seen as cyclotomic quotients of aﬃne Hecke algebras of type A, and
also as deformations of the group algebra of the complex reﬂection group G(d, 1, n). Such
deformations, in the general case of complex reﬂection groups, have been deﬁned by Broué,
Malle and Rouquier [BMR]:
in that sense, Ariki–Koike algebras are the Hecke algebras
associated with G(d, 1, n).

One of the most important results on the representation theory of Ariki–Koike algebras
is Ariki’s categoriﬁcation theorem [Ar] (proving a conjecture of Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon
[LLT]). This result implies that the decomposition matrices of such algebras can be com-
puted using the canonical bases for quantum groups in aﬃne type A. Partially motivated
by this work, Khovanov and Lauda [KhLau1, KhLau2] and Rouquier [Rou] have indepen-
dently deﬁned the same algebra, known as quiver Hecke algebra or KLR algebra, in order
to categorify quantum groups. In fact, they have shown that we have the following algebra
isomorphism:

U −

A (g) ≃ [Proj(H)] = Mβ∈Q+

[Proj(Hβ)]

where U −
A (g) is the integral form of the negative half of the quantum group Uq(g) associated
with a symmetrizable Cartan datum, with A = Z[q, q−1], the set Q+ is the positive root
lattice associated with the Cartan datum, the algebra H = ⊕β∈Q+Hβ is the quiver Hecke
algebra corresponding to this Cartan datum and [Proj(H)] is the Grothendieck group of the
additive category of ﬁnitely generated graded projective H-modules. A cyclotomic version of
this theorem was conjectured in [KhLau1], the cyclotomic categoriﬁcation conjecture, which
was later proved by Kang and Kashiwara [KanKa]. More speciﬁcally, for each dominant

1

weight Λ the algebra H has a cyclotomic quotient HΛ which categoriﬁes the corresponding
highest weight module V (Λ).

A big step towards understanding these cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebras was made by
Brundan and Kleshchev [BrKl] and independentely by Rouquier [Rou]. The ﬁrst two authors
proved that cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type A are particular cases of cyclotomic quiver
Hecke algebras; a similar result in the aﬃne case has been proved by Rouquier. Brundan
and Kleshchev also noticed that the cyclotomic Hecke algebra inherits the natural grading of
the cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebra, whose grading allows in particular to study the graded
representation theory of cyclotomic Hecke algebras (see for example [BrKl2]). Moreover,
they established a connection between the cyclotomic categoriﬁcation theorem in type A for
quiver Hecke algebras and Ariki’s categoriﬁcation theorem.

On the other hand, Yokonuma [Yo] deﬁned the Yokonuma–Hecke algebras in the study
of ﬁnite Chevalley groups: they arise once again as centralizer algebras of the induced repre-
sentation from the trivial representation, but now on a maximal unipotent subgroup. Their
natural presentation in type A has been transformed since (see [Ju1, Ju2, JuKa, ChPA]),
and the one we use here is given in [ChPou]. Similarly to Ariki–Koike algebras, Yokonuma–
Hecke algebras of type A can be viewed as deformations of the group algebra of G(d, 1, n).
This deformation, unlike in the Ariki–Koike case, “respects” the wreath product structure
G(d, 1, n) ≃ (Z/dZ) ≀ Sn. The representation theory of Yokonuma–Hecke algebras has been
ﬁrst studied by Thiem [Th1, Th2, Th3], while a combinatorial approach to this represen-
tation theory in type A has been given in [ChPA, ChPA2]. In this latter paper [ChPA2],
Chlouveraki and Poulain d’Andecy introduced and studied generalisations of these alge-
bras: the aﬃne Yokonuma–Hecke algebras and their cyclotomic quotients, which generalise
aﬃne Hecke algebras of type A and Ariki–Koike algebras respectively. The interest in
Yokonuma–Hecke algebras has grown recently: in [CJKL], the authors deﬁned a link invari-
ant from Yokonuma–Hecke algebras which is stronger than the famous ones (such as the
HOMFLYPT polynomial), obtained from classical Iwahori–Hecke algebras of type A and
Ariki–Koike algebras.

The aim of this paper is to show that cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebras are particular
cases of cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebras, generalising thus the results of Brundan and
Kleshchev [BrKl]; our goal will be achieved in Section 4 with Theorem 4.1. In fact, every
known result on the cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebra can be applied to the cyclotomic
Yokonuma–Hecke algebra: this includes the cyclotomic categoriﬁcation theorem and the
existence of a graded representation theory. In order to prove the main result Theorem 4.1,
our strategy is to deﬁne inverse algebra homomorphisms, by constructing the images of the
deﬁning generators of the corresponding algebras; we proceed as in [BrKl]. In particular, we
give an argument to avoid doing the calculations of [BrKl] again, see for instance Remark 2.6.
Finally, as in [BrKl] we also consider the degenerate case: in Section 5 we will deﬁne the
degenerate cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebras and show that they are cyclotomic quiver
Hecke algebras as well (Theorem 5.14).

deﬁne in Section 1 the cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebrabYΛ

We give now a brief overview of this article. Given a base ﬁeld F and d, n ∈ N∗, we ﬁrst
d,n(q) where q ∈ F \ {0, 1} has
order e ∈ N≥2 ∪{∞} in F × and Λ is a ﬁnitely-supported e-tuple of non-negative integers. We
also deﬁne the cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebra HΛ
α(Γ) where α |=ed n is an ed-composition
of n and where Γ is the quiver given by d disjoint copies of the (cyclic) quiver Γe with
e vertices used in [BrKl]. We begin Section 2 by considering in YΛ
d,n(q) a natural system
{e[α]}α|=edn of pairwise orthogonal central idempotents. Then, we deﬁne the “quiver Hecke
d,n(q) and we check that they verify the deﬁning relations
of HΛ
α(Γ) and again
check the corresponding deﬁning relations. We conclude the proof of the main theorem in
Section 4 by showing that we have deﬁned inverse algebra homomorphisms. Finally, we
justify in Section 5 that the isomorphism of Theorem 4.1 remains true for the degenerate
d,n(1) that we deﬁne in §5.1. We end the paper with
d,n(1)

α(Γ). In Section 3 we deﬁne the “Yokonuma–Hecke generators” of HΛ

1 Setting

Let d, n ∈ N∗ and let F be a ﬁeld which contains a primitive dth root of unity ξ; in particular,
the characteristic of F does not divide d. We consider an element q ∈ F × and we deﬁne
e ∈ N∗ ∪ {∞} as the smallest integer such that 1 + q + · · · + qe−1 = 0. We will sometimes
use the quantum characteristic of F , given by:

charq(F ) :=(e

0

if e < ∞,
if e = ∞,

in particular char1(F ) is exactly the usual characteristic of F . Except in Section 5, the
element q will always be taken diﬀerent from 1.

Let J := {0, . . . , d − 1}, and let I := Z/charq(F )Z. Finally, we consider a tuple Λ =

(Λi)i∈I ∈ N(I). We deﬁne its level by ℓ(Λ) :=Pi∈I Λi, and we suppose that ℓ(L) > 0. Note

that we may consider Λ as a dominant integral weight over a given Kac–Moody algebra but
we will not need that (see for example [BrKl] for the case d = 1).

the notation X H

commutative and we have the following equalities:

gaXb = Xbga

does not depend on the choice of the reduced expression by Matsumoto’s theorem since the

1.2 Cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebras

Let us consider Γe the following quiver:

• the vertices are the elements of I;

• the arrows are i → i + 1 for each i ∈ I.

We give some examples in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Three examples of quivers Γe

We deﬁne now the quiver

Γ :=aj∈J

Γe

given by d disjoint copies of Γe. Hence, our quiver Γ is described in the following way:

• the vertices are the elements of K := I × J;

• the arrows are (i, j) → (i + 1, j) for each (i, j) ∈ K.

In particular, there is an arrow between (i, j) and (i′, j′) in Γ if and only if there is an arrow
between i and i′ in Γe and j = j′. For k, k′ ∈ K, we write k ⇆ k′ when k → k′ and k ← k′;
this happens only when e = 2. Finally, write k 6— k′ if k 6= k′ and if there is no arrow (to
the left or to the right) between these two vertices.

Let α = (αk)k∈K be a tuple of non-negative integers, whose sum is equal to n; we say
that α is a composition of n and we write α |=K n. Let K α be the subset of K n consisting
of the elements (k1, . . . , kn) ∈ K n such that for all k ∈ K, there are exactly αk integers
s ∈ {1, . . . , n} for which ks = k. Note that the sets K α are exactly the Sn-orbits of K n,

the action being given by the diagonal action on I n × J n that is σ((i, j)) := (σ(i), σ(j)). In
particular, the sets K α are ﬁnite. We will use the following notations:

I α := {i ∈ I n : ∃j ∈ J n, (i, j) ∈ K α},
J α := {j ∈ J n : ∃i ∈ I n, (i, j) ∈ K α}.

The sets I α and J α are ﬁnite and Sn-orbits; note that K α is included in I α × J α (we don’t
have the equality in general).

Finaly, note that a deﬁnition for general quivers is given in [Rou], while we can ﬁnd in
[KanKa] a cyclotomic condition more general than (1.17).

The proof of the following result is the same as in [BrKl, Lemma 2.1].

Lemma 1.3. The elements ya ∈ HΛ

α(Γ) are nilpotent for a ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

As a corollary, we can give a ﬁnite generating family of HΛ

n (Γ), where ψw := ψa1 · · · ψar
for a given reduced expression w = sa1 · · · sar ∈ Sn (see [KanKa, §4.1] and also [BrKl,
Corollary 2.2]).

Proposition 1.4. The algebra HΛ
of generators is given by {ψwyr1

α(Γ) is a ﬁnite-dimensional F -vector space and a family

1 · · · yrn

n e(k) : w ∈ Sn, ra ∈ N, k ∈ K α}.

Remark 1.5. Contrary to the Yokonuma–Hecke case, as the ψa do not verify the braid
relation ψaψa+1ψa = ψa+1ψaψa+1, the elements ψw may depend on the chosen reduced
expression for w. Moreover, it is harder to get a linear basis and even the dimension.

Let us end this section by recalling that there is a unique Z-grading of HΛ

α(Γ) such that
e(k) is of degree 0, ya is of degree 2 and ψae(k) is of degree −aka,ka+1 where (ak,k′ )k,k′∈K is

To deﬁne this algebra homomorphism, it suﬃces to deﬁne the images of the generators

the same strategy was used by Brundan and Kleshchev in [BrKl] for d = 1.

2.1 Deﬁnition of the images of the generators

We deﬁne now our diﬀerent “quiver Hecke generators”.

2.1.1

Image of e(i, j)

Let M be a ﬁnite-dimensional bYΛ

d,n(q)-module. Each Xa acts on M as an endomorphism
of the ﬁnite-dimensional F -vector space (see Proposition 1.1); in particular, by (1.11) the
eigenvalues of X1 can be written qi for i ∈ I. Hence, applying [CuWa, Lemma 5.2] we know
that the eigenvalues of each Xa are of the form qi for i ∈ I. Concerning the ta, by (1.2)
(they are diagonalizable and) their eigenvalues are dth root of unity.

As the elements of the family {Xa, ta}1≤a≤n pairwise commute, using Cayley–Hamilton
theorem we can write M as the direct sum of its weight spaces (simultaneous generalized
eigenspaces)

M (i, j) :=(cid:8)v ∈ M : (Xa − qia )N v = (ta − ξja )v = 0 for all 1 ≤ a ≤ n(cid:9)

(2.28)

6

for (i, j) ∈ I n × J n, where N ≫ 0 and ξ is the given primitive dth root of unity in F that we
considered at the very beginning of Section 1. Observe that some M (i, j) may be reduced
to zero, and in fact only a ﬁnite number of them are non-zero.
Remark 2.1. The element ea acts on M (i, j) as 0 if ja 6= ja+1 and as 1 if ja = ja+1.

We can now consider the family of projections {e(k)}k∈K n associated with the decompo-
sition M = ⊕k∈K nM (k): the element e(k) is the projection onto M (k) along ⊕k′6=kM (k′),
in particular e(k)2 = 0 and if k 6= k′ then e(k)e(k′) = 0. Moreover, only a ﬁnite number of
e(k) are non-zero.

As the e(k) are polynomials in X1, . . . , Xn, t1, . . . tn (in fact e(k) is the product of com-
muting projections onto the corresponding generalized eigenspaces of Xa and ta), they belong

d,n(q).

to bYΛ
Remark 2.2. The above polynomials do not depend on the ﬁnite-dimensionalbYΛ

We are now able to deﬁne our central idempotents. We set, for α |=K n:

M .

d,n(q)-module

e[α] := Xk∈K α

e(k)

(since K α is a Sn-orbit, the element e[α] is indeed central). Though we will not use this fact,
α(q) :=
d,n(q) which are not reduced to zero are the blocks of the Yokonuma–Hecke algebra

we can notice that according to [PA, Corollary 3.2] and [LyMa], the subalgebras bYΛ
e[α]bYΛ
bYΛ

We will sometimes need the following elements:

d,n(q) (see also [CuWa, §6.2]).

e[α]e(i, j),

e[α](i) := Xj∈J α
e[α](j) := Xi∈I α

e[α]e(i, j).

(2.29)

Considering the bYΛ

α(q)-module M [α] := e[α]M , the element e[α](i) is the projection onto
M [α](i) := {v ∈ M [α] : e[α](Xa − qia )N v = 0 for all 1 ≤ a ≤ n} for N ≫ 0, along
⊕i′∈I α\{i}M [α](i′); the element e[α](i) is a polynomial in X1, . . . , Xn whose coeﬃcients are
independent of M . For d = 1 we recover the element e(i) of [BrKl, §4.1] and we denote
it by eH(i). Similarly, the element e[α](j) is the projection onto M [α](j) := {v ∈ M [α] :
e[α](ta − ξja )v = 0 for all 1 ≤ a ≤ n} along ⊕j ′∈J α\{j}M [α](j′). Finally, note that:

e[α](i) · e[α](j) = e[α](j) · e[α](i) = e(i, j).

be multiplied by e[α] and we write e(i) (respectively e(j)) for e[α](i) (resp. e[α](j)).

From now, unless mentioned otherwise, we always work in bYΛ

We give now a few useful lemmas.

α(q); every relation should

Lemma 2.3. If 1 ≤ a < n and j ∈ J α is such that ja 6= ja+1 then we have:

g2
ae(j) = qe(j),

gaXa+1e(j) = Xagae(j),
Xa+1gae(j) = gaXae(j).

Proof. We deduce it the from relations (1.5), (1.14) and (1.15) and from eae(j) = 0 (since
ja 6= ja+1, see Remark 2.1).

Lemma 2.4. For 1 ≤ a < n and j ∈ J α we have gae(j) = e(sa(j))ga.

Fix now j ∈ J and let j′ ∈ J and v ∈ M (j′). If j′ = j then we get:

α(q). Given the relation (1.4), we see that ga maps M (j) to M (sa(j)).

Proof. Let M := bYΛ

gae(j)v = e(sa(j))gav (= gav),

7

and if j′ 6= j, since gav ∈ M (sa(j′)) we have:

gae(j)v = 0 = e(sa(j))gav.

Hence, e(sa(j))ga and gae(j) coincide on each M (j′) for j′ ∈ J thus coincide on M =

⊕j ′ M (j′) and we conclude since M = bYΛ

Corollary 2.5. Let 1 ≤ a < n and j ∈ J α; if ja = ja+1 then ga and e(j) commute.
Remark 2.6 (About Brundan and Kleshchev’s proof - I). Let 1 ≤ a < n; if j ∈ J α veriﬁes
ja = ja+1, the following relations are veriﬁed between gae(j) and the Xbe(j) for 1 ≤ b ≤ n

Lemma 2.7. For 1 ≤ a < n and (i, j) ∈ K α such that ja 6= ja+1 we have gae(i)e(j) =

Proof. Given Lemma 2.3, we show as in Lemma 2.4 that gae(i)e(j) = e(sa(i))gae(j); we get
the ﬁnal result applying Lemma 2.4.

2.1.2

Image of ya

We are now able to deﬁne the elements ya for 1 ≤ a ≤ n. We saw in Lemma 1.3 that
these elements (in HΛ
α(q) for
1 ≤ a ≤ n:

α(Γ)) are nilpotent, hence we deﬁne the following elements of bYΛ

α (q).

ya := Xi∈I α

(1 − q−ia Xa)e(i) ∈ bYΛ

We can notice thatPi(qia − Xa)e(i) is the nilpotent part of the Jordan–Chevalley decom-

position of Xa; in particular, ya is nilpotent. As a consequence, we will be able to make
calculations in the ring F [[y1, . . . , yn]] of power series in the commuting variables y1, . . . , yn.
We will sometimes also need the following element:

ya(i) := qia (1 − ya),

which veriﬁes:

ya(i)e(i) = Xae(i).

(2.30)

We end this paragraph with a lemma.

Lemma 2.8. For j ∈ J α such that ja 6= ja+1 we have:

gaya+1e(j) = yagae(j),
ya+1gae(j) = gayae(j).

8

Proof. Indeed, gaya+1e(j) = Pi(ga − q−ia+1 gaXa+1)e(i, j) and applying Lemmas 2.3 and

2.7 we get:

gaya+1e(j) = Xi∈I α
= Xi∈I α

gaya+1e(j) = yagae(j).

2.1.3

Image of ψa

We ﬁrst deﬁne some invertible elements Qa(i, j) ∈ F [[ya, ya+1]]× for 1 ≤ a < n and (i, j) ∈
K α by:

Qa(i, j) :=

1 − q + qya+1 − ya
(ya(i) − qya+1(i))/(ya(i) − ya+1(i))
(ya(i) − qya+1(i))/(ya(i) − ya+1(i))2
qia
qia /(ya(i) − ya+1(i))

if ia = ia+1,
if ia 6— ia+1,
if ia → ia+1,
if ia ← ia+1,
if ia ⇆ ia+1,





fa,j

if ja = ja+1,

if ja 6= ja+1,

where fa,j ∈ {1, q} is given for ja 6= ja+1 by:

fa,j :=(q

1

if ja < ja+1,
if ja > ja+1,

with < being a total ordering on J = Z/dZ (we could take for example the natural order
of {0, . . . , d − 1}). For d = 1 the power series Qa(i, j) coincides with the deﬁnition given at
[BrKl, (4.36)].
Remark 2.9. The elements Qa(i, j) depend only on (ia, ia+1) and (ja, ja+1).

The scalar fa,j is only an artefact: if q admits a square root q1/2 in F , we can simply

set fa,j := q1/2. Finally, we give an easy lemma about these fa,j.

Lemma 2.10. If ja 6= ja+1 then fa,jfa,sa(j) = q.

We introduce a notation for a power series Q ∈ F [[y1, . . . , yn]]: if σ ∈ Sn is a permuta-
tion, we denote by Qσ the power series Qσ(y1, . . . , yn) := Q(yσ−1(1), . . . , yσ−1(n)); note that
(Qσ)ρ = Qσρ (we get a right action).

We will use later the following properties veriﬁed by Qa(i, j) (see [BrKl, (4.35)]), where

Qσ(i, j) := Q(i, j)σ.

Lemma 2.11. We have:

Qsa
Qsa+1

a

a+1(i, j) = Qsa+1

(sa+1sa(i, j)),
a
(i, j) = Qsa
a+1(sasa+1(i, j)).

Proof. We check only the ﬁrst equality, the second being straightforward considering (i′, j′) :=
sasa+1(i, j). Let us write ya(ia) instead of ya(i). Noticing that sa+1sa = (a, a + 2, a + 1),
we get for ja+1 = ja+2:

Qa(sa+1sa(i, j)) =



1 − q + qya+1 − ya
(ya(ia+1) − qya+1(ia+2))/(ya(ia+1) − ya+1(ia+2))
(ya(ia+1) − qya+1(ia+2))/(ya(ia+1) − ya+1(ia+2))2
qia+1
qia+1 /(ya(ia+1) − ya+1(ia+2))

if ia+1 = ia+2,
if ia+1 6— ia+2,
if ia+1 → ia+2,
if ia+1 ← ia+2,
if ia+1 ⇆ ia+2,

9

and we conclude using ya(ia+1)sa+1 = ya(ia+1) and ya+1(ia+2)sa+1 = ya+2(ia+2). If ja+1 6=

ja+2, we have Qa(sa+1sa(i, j)) = fa,(a,a+2,a+1)(j) =(q

fa+1,j.

We now introduce the following element of bYΛ
(cid:0)1 − XaX −1

Φa := ga + (1 − q) X(i,j)∈K α

a+1(cid:1)−1

α(q):

ia6=ia+1
ja=ja+1

if ja+1 < ja+2,
if ja+1 > ja+2,

and this is exactly

e(i, j) + X(i,j)∈K α

ia=ia+1
ja=ja+1

e(i, j),

−1

where (1 − XaX −1
α(q)e(k). Note
that this element is indeed invertible, since for k = (i, j) with ia 6= ia+1 its only eigenvalue
1 − qia−ia+1 is non-zero, thanks to the deﬁnition of I.

a+1)e(k) in e(k)bYΛ

e(k) denotes the inverse of (1 − XaX −1

a+1)

In particular, we have:

Φae(j) = gae(j)

if ja 6= ja+1.

For d = 1 we get the “intertwining element” deﬁned in [BrKl, §4.2], and we write it ΦH
a .

Lemma 2.12. We have the following properties:

Φae(j) = e(sa(j))Φa,

Φae(i, j) = e(sa(i, j))Φa,

ΦaXb = XbΦa
Φayb = ybΦa

∀b 6= a, a + 1,
∀b 6= a, a + 1,

ΦaQb(k) = Qb(k)Φa

∀|b − a| > 1,

ΦaΦb = ΦbΦa

∀|b − a| > 1.

(2.31)
(2.32)

(2.33)
(2.34)

(2.35)

(2.36)

Proof. We will use results from [BrKl, Lemma 4.1] (which is this lemma for d = 1).

(2.31) Using Lemma 2.4, it is clear if ja 6= ja+1 since then Φae(j) = gae(j) = e(sa(j))ga =
e(sa(j))Φa. Using Corollary 2.5 it is clear if ja = ja+1 since e(j) commutes with every
term in the deﬁnition of Φa.

(2.32) If ja = ja+1, we claim that the relation comes applying (2.31) and Remark 2.6 on the

equality ΦH

a eH(i) = eH(sa(i))ΦH

a . If ja 6= ja+1 it follows directly from Lemma 2.7.

(2.33) Straightforward using (1.13) and since e(i, j) are polynomials in X1, . . . , Xn.
(2.34) Using (2.32) and (2.33) we get:

(1 − q−ib Xb)e(sa(i, j))Φa

(1 − q−ib Xb)e(sa(i))Φa = ybΦa,

Φayb =Xi,j
=Xi

since (sa(i))b = ib.

(2.35) Since Qb(k) ∈ F [[yb, yb+1]] and b 6= a, a + 1 and b + 1 6= a, a + 1 it follows from (2.34).
(2.36) Let us write Φ′

a := Φa − ga. Using (1.13) and Lemma 2.7 we get:

(1 − XaX −1

a+1)

e(sb(i, j))

and exchanging a and b we get gaΦ′
use here |b − a| > 1) and using (1.6), we get ΦaΦb = (ga + Φ′

bga. Noticing that Φ′

b = gbga + gbΦ′

a = (gb + Φ′

Remark 2.13. Though we will not need this in this ﬁrst part of the proof, we deﬁne now the
following power series Pa(i, j) ∈ F [[ya, ya+1]] for 1 ≤ a < n and (i, j) ∈ K α by:

(1
Pa(i, j) :=

0

(1 − q)(1 − ya(i)ya+1(i)−1)−1

if ia = ia+1,
if ia 6= ia+1,

if ja = ja+1,

if ja 6= ja+1.

For d = 1 we recover the deﬁnition given at [BrKl, (4.27)]. Moreover, we have the following
equality:

(ga + Pa(k)) e(k).

(2.37)

Φa = Xk∈K α

Indeed, the only non-obvious fact to check is Pa(i, j)e(i, j) = (1 − q)(1 − XaX −1
e(i, j)
if ia 6= ia+1 and ja = ja+1, but this is clear by (2.30). We will also use the following equality
(the same one as in Lemma 2.11):

a+1)

−1

P sa
a+1(i, j) = P sa+1

a

(sa+1sa(i, j)).

(2.38)

We are now ready to deﬁne our elements ψa for 1 ≤ a < n:

ψa := Xk∈K α

ΦaQa(k)−1e(k) ∈ bYΛ

α(q).

As usual, we write ψH

a for ψa when d = 1, and this element ψH

a corresponds with the ψa

of [BrKl, §4.3]. Note ﬁnally that for j ∈ J α we have:

ψae(j) = f −1

a,j gae(j)

if ja 6= ja+1.

2.2 Check of the deﬁning relations

We now check the deﬁning relations (1.17)–(1.27) for the elements we have just deﬁned. The
idea is the following: when an element e(i, j) lies in a relation to check, if ja = ja+1 then we
get immediately the result by Remark 2.6 rewriting the same proof as [BrKl, Theorem 4.2],
and if ja 6= ja+1 then it will be easy (at least, easier than in [BrKl]) to prove the relation.
α(q), in particular every relation should be multiplied by

Recall that we always work in bYΛ

e[α] and we write e(i) and e(j) without any [α].

(1.17) That it is exactly the same proof in HΛ
α(q);
recall that the action of X1 on M is given by the action of e[α]X1. By (1.11) we have

α(q). Let (i, j) ∈ K α and set M := bYΛ
e(i)i = 0.

As an endomorphism of M (i), the element (X1 − qi′

(1.18) Straightforward from the deﬁnition of the e(k) for k ∈ K α.

(1.19) Straightforward since ya and e(k) both lie in the commutative subalgebra generated
by {t1, . . . , tn, X1, . . . , Xn}.

(1.20) Straightforward by (2.32) and since Qa(k′) and e(k′) commute with e(k).

(1.21) True since {Xa}a is commutative.

(1.22) True by (2.34).

(1.23) Let |a − b| > 1. We have, using (1.20), (2.35) and (2.36):

ψaψb =Xk
=Xk
=Xk
=Xk

ΦaQa(k)−1e(k)ψb

ΦaQa(k)−1ψbe(sb(k))

ΦaQa(k)−1ΦbQb(sb(k))−1e(sb(k))

ΦbQb(sb(k))−1ΦaQa(k)−1e(sb(k)).

Hence, noticing that (see Remark 2.9) Qa(k) = Qa(sb(k)) and Qb(sb(k)) = Qb(sasb(k)) we
get:

ΦbQb(sb(k))−1ψae(sb(k))

ΦbQb(sb(k))−1e(sasb(k))ψa

ψaψb =Xk
=Xk

ψaψb = ψbψa.

(1.24) First, if k = (i, j) veriﬁes ja = ja+1 then by Remark 2.6 we get from:

a+1eH(i) =((yH

a ψH
yH
a ψH

a eH(i)

if ia = ia+1,
if ia 6= ia+1,

the following equality:

ψaya+1e(i, j) =((yaψa + 1)e(i, j)

yaψae(i, j)

if (ia, ja) = (ia+1, ja+1),
if ia 6= ia+1 and ja = ja+1,

hence it remains to deal with the case ja 6= ja+1 (and no condition on i). Using Lemma 2.8
we get:

ψaya+1e(i, j) = ΦaQa(i, j)−1ya+1e(i, j)

a,j gaya+1e(i, j)
a,j yagae(i, j)

= f −1
= f −1
= yaΦaQa(i, j)−1e(i, j)

ψaya+1e(i, j) = yaψae(i, j).

Finally, we have proved:

ψaya+1e(k) =((yaψa + 1)e(k)

yaψae(k)

if ka = ka+1,
if ka 6= ka+1,

which is exactly (1.24).

12

(1.25) Similar.
Remark 2.14. Thanks to relations (1.22), (1.24) and (1.25), given f ∈ F [[y1, . . . , yn]] and
k ∈ K α such that ka 6= ka+1 we have f ψae(k) = ψaf sae(k). In particular, this holds if
ja 6= ja+1 with k = (i, j).

(1.26) Once again, the result is straightforward if ja = ja+1 using Remark 2.6. Let us
then suppose ja 6= ja+1; hence, necessary ka 6— ka+1 so we have to prove ψ2
ae(k) = e(k). We
have:

ψ2

ae(k) = ψae(sa(k))ψa

= ΦaQa(sa(k))−1e(sa(k))ψa
= f −1
a,sa(j)gaΦaQa(k)−1e(k)

ψ2
ae(k) = (fa,sa(j)fa,j)−1g2

ae(k).

Applying Lemmas 2.3 and 2.10 we ﬁnd ψ2
thus we are done.

ae(k) = e(k) (recall e(k) = e(i)e(j) = e(j)e(i))

(1.27)
If ja = ja+1 = ja+2, we get the result using Remark 2.6. Let us then suppose
that we are not in that case: we have to prove ψa+1ψaψa+1e(k) = ψaψa+1ψae(k). We will
intensively use (1.20); note also that:

Φae(i, j) =

and:

(cid:16)ga + (1 − q)(1 − XaX −1

a+1)

(ga + 1)e(i, j)

−1(cid:17) e(i, j)

if ia 6= ia+1 and ja = ja+1,

if ia = ia+1 and ja = ja+1,
otherwise (ja 6= ja+1),

ψae(i, j) =(ΦaQa(i, j)−1e(i, j)

f −1
a,j gae(i, j)

if ja = ja+1,
if ja 6= ja+1.

It is convenient to introduce some notations. The couple (i, j) shall only be modiﬁed
by the action of sa or sa+1, hence we only write ((ia, ia+1, ia+2), (ja, ja+1, ja+2)) for (i, j).
Moreover, for clarity we forget comas and only write the indexation, substituting 0 to a;
thus, ((ia, ia+1, ia+2), (ja, ja+1, ja+2)) becomes ((012), (012)). Finally, as Sn acts diagonally
on I × J we can write (012) instead of ((012), (012)). Because an example beats lines of
explanation, here is one: ψ0e(102) stands for ψae(sa(k)).

Case j0 = j1 6= j2. Let us ﬁrst compute ψ1ψ0ψ1e(012) and ψ0ψ1ψ0e(012). We have:

ψ1ψ0ψ1e(012) = ψ1ψ0e(021)ψ1
= ψ1e(201)ψ0ψ1

ψ1ψ0ψ1e(012) = Φ1Q1(201)−1e(201)ψ0ψ1.

Since Q1(201)−1 ∈ F [[y1, y2]] and recalling Remark 2.14 we get:

ψ1ψ0ψ1e(012) = Φ1e(201)ψ0Qs0

1 (201)−1ψ1 = Φ1e(201)ψ0ψ1Qs0s1

(201)−1.

By Lemma 2.11 we have Qs0s1
Q0(012). Hence:

1

(201) = Q1(201)s0s1 = (Q1(201)s0)s1 = (Q0(s1s0(201))s1 )s1 =

ψ1ψ0ψ1e(012) = Φ1e(201)ψ0ψ1Q0(012)−1.

As:

ψ0ψ1ψ0e(012) = ψ0ψ1Φ0e(012)Q0(012)−1,

to have (1.27) it suﬃces to prove:

Φ1e(201)ψ0ψ1 = ψ0ψ1Φ0e(012).

(2.40)

Let us distinguish two subcases.

1,(012)g0g1e(102)Φ0,

Using the braid relation (1.7) it becomes, recalling (2.32):

Φ1e(201)ψ0ψ1 = f −1

and then, noticing that f1,(012) = f1,(102) and f0,(021) = f0,(120):

Φ1e(201)ψ0ψ1 = f −1
= f −1

1,(012)g0g1e(102)Φ0

0,(120)f −1
0,(120)g0e(120)ψ1Φ0

Φ1e(201)ψ0ψ1 = ψ0ψ1Φ0e(012),

thus (2.40) is proved.

• If i0 = i1 then:

Φ1e(201) = (g1 + 1)e(201),
Φ0e(012) = (g0 + 1)e(012),

thus with the same calculation as above (even easier) we get:

Φ1e(201)ψ0ψ1 = f −1

0,(021)f −1

1,(012)(g1g0g1 + g0g1)e(012)

= f −1

0,(120)f −1

1,(102)(g0g1g0 + g0g1)e(012) = ψ0ψ1Φ0e(012),

so we got (2.40).

Until the end of the proof we use the same arguments as here, arguments which we will thus
not recall.

Case j0 6= j1 = j2. Similar.

Case j0 = j2 6= j1. Once again we begin with the computation of ψ1ψ0ψ1e(012) and

ψ0ψ1ψ0e(012). We have:

ψ1ψ0ψ1e(012) = ψ1Φ0Q0(021)−1e(021)ψ1 = ψ1Φ0e(021)ψ1Qs1

0 (021)−1,

and:

ψ0ψ1ψ0e(012) = ψ0Φ1Q1(102)−1e(102)ψ0 = ψ0Φ1e(102)ψ0Qs0

1 (102)−1.

Since Qs1

0 (021)−1 = Qs0

1 (102)−1, it suﬃces to prove:

ψ1Φ0e(021)ψ1 = ψ0Φ1e(102)ψ0.

= α(g0g1g0 + g2
0)e(012) = ψ0Φ1e(102)ψ0e(012).

Case #{ja, ja+1, ja+2} = 3. We have ja 6= ja+1 and ja 6= ja+2 and ja+1 6= ja+2 thus

we get immediately:

ψ1ψ0ψ1e(012) = f −1

1,(201)f −1

0,(021)f −1

1,(012)g1g0g1e(012)

= f −1

0,(120)f −1

1,(102)f −1

0,(012)g0g1g0e(012) = ψ0ψ1ψ0e(012),

since f1,(201) = f0,(012) and f0,(021) = f1,(102) and f1,(012) = f0,(120).

3 Yokonuma–Hecke generators of HΛ

α(Γ)

The aim of this section is to deﬁne an algebra homomorphism σ : bYΛ
we do not consider yet bYΛ

α(Γ) (note that
α(q)). Hence, it suﬃces to deﬁne the images of the generators (1.1)
and check if they verify the deﬁning relations of the cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebra.
As in Section 2, we use the same notation for a generator and its image.

d,n(q) → HΛ

3.1 Deﬁnition of the images of the generators

It is easier this time to deﬁne these images. First, since the elements y1, . . . , yn are nilpotent
(Lemma 1.3), we can consider power series in these variables. Hence, the quantities Pa(k),
Qa(k) and ya(i) that we deﬁned in §2.1 are also well-deﬁned as elements of HΛ
α(Γ). We
deﬁne ﬁnally as in (2.29) the elements e(i) and e(j) of HΛ

α(Γ) for i ∈ I α and j ∈ J α.

We recall that ξ is a primitive dth root of unity in F . Our “Yokonuma–Hecke generators”
α(Γ) are given below.

Xa := Xi∈I α

for 1 ≤ a ≤ n

for 1 ≤ a ≤ n

As usual, we write gH

a and X H

a the corresponding elements for d = 1: we recover the

elements of [BrKl, §4.4].
Remark 3.1 (About Brundan and Kleshchev’s proof - II). This remark is similar to Re-
mark 2.6. If j ∈ J α veriﬁes ja = ja+1 and if a relation in [BrKl, §4] involves only ψH
a , eH(i)
for i ∈ I α and yH
b for 1 ≤ b ≤ n, whose proof does not require any cyclotomic relation, then
by the same proof, the same relation is satisﬁed between ψae(j), e(i, j) and ybe(j) in the
unitary algebra e(j)HΛ
α(Γ)e(j). If j veriﬁes in addition ja+1 = ja+2, we will be able to add
relations with ψH

a+1, which we substitute by ψa+1e(j).

3.2 Check of the deﬁning relations

As in §2.2, we will use Remark 3.1 when ja = ja+1 to get the result from the same corre-
sponding proof of [BrKl, Theorem 4.3], and when ja 6= ja+1 we will need a few calculations.

(1.2) Straightforward since e(j)e(j′) = δj,j ′ e(j) and ξd = 1.

(1.3) Straightforward since e(j)e(j′) = e(j′)e(j).

(1.4) According to (1.18), it suﬃces to prove tbgae(i, j) = gatsa(b)e(i, j) for every (i, j) ∈
K α. For (i, j) ∈ K α, we have, using (1.20):

tbgae(i, j) = tb(ψaQa(i, j) − Pa(i, j))e(i, j)

= tb [e(sa(i, j))ψaQa(i, j) − e(i, j)Pa(i, j)]
= ξ(sa(j))b ψaQa(i, j)e(i, j) − ξjb Pa(i, j)e(i, j)
tbgae(i, j) = ψaQa(i, j)ξ(sa(j))b e(i, j) − Pa(i, j)ξjb e(i, j),

and:

gatsa(b)e(i, j) = gaξjsa (b) e(i, j) = ψaQa(i, j)ξjsa(b) e(i, j) − Pa(i, j)ξjsa (b) e(i, j).

As (sa(j))b = jsa(b) (by deﬁnition of the action of Sn on J n), it suﬃces to prove the

following:

Pa(i, j)ξjb = Pa(i, j)ξjsa (b) .

• It is clear if b /∈ {a, a + 1} since b = sa(b).
• If b ∈ {a, a + 1}, it is clear if ja = ja+1 and obvious if ja 6= ja+1 since then Pa(i, j) = 0.

(1.5). Let (i, j) ∈ K α and let us prove g2
ae(i, j) = (q + (q − 1)gaea)e(i, j); summing over
all (i, j) ∈ K α will conclude. If ja = ja+1 then it is immediate applying Remark 3.1 on
(gH
a and left-multiplying by e(i), recalling eae(j) = e(j) and Corollary 2.5.
If now ja 6= ja+1, since eae(j) = 0 it suﬃces to prove g2
ae(i, j) = qe(i, j). But (recalling
Qa(i, j) = fa,j and Pa(i, j) = 0):

a )2 = q + (q − 1)gH

g2
ae(i, j) = ga(ψaQa(i, j) − Pa(i, j))e(i, j)

= fa,jgaψae(i, j)
= fa,jgae(sa(i, j))ψa
= fa,j(ψaQa(sa(i, j)) − Pa(sa(i, j)))ψae(i, j)

ae(i, j) = fa,jfa,sa(j)ψ2
g2

ae(i, j),

hence we conclude using Lemma 2.10 and (1.26), since ja 6= ja+1 implies (ia, ja) 6— (ia+1, ja+1).

16

(1.6). Let us prove gagbe(k) = gbgae(k) for every k ∈ K α. By (1.22) the element ψb
commutes with the elements Pa(k) and Qa(k) of F [[ya, ya+1]]. Moreover, Qa(sb(k)) = Qa(k)
and Pa(sb(k)) = Pa(k), hence:

gagbe(k) = ga(ψbQb(k) − Pb(k))e(k)

= gae(sb(k))ψbQb(k) − gae(k)Pb(k)
= (ψaQa(k) − Pa(k))ψbQb(k)e(k) − (ψaQa(k) − Pa(k))Pb(k)e(k)
= ψaψbQa(k)Qb(k)e(k) − ψbQb(k)Pa(k)e(k) − ψaQa(k)Pb(k)e(k)

+ Pa(k)Pb(k)e(k),

and we conclude since that expression is symmetric in a and b (recalling (1.23)).

(1.7). Again it suﬃces to prove ga+1gaga+1e(i, j) = gaga+1gae(i, j) for all (i, j) ∈ K α. If
ja = ja+1 = ja+2 we get the result using Remark 3.1. Let us then suppose that we are not
in that case. We will intensively use (1.20); recall the following fact:

gae(i, j) =((ψaQa(i, j) − Pa(i, j))e(i, j)

fa,jψae(i, j)

if ja = ja+1,
if ja 6= ja+1.

Finally, as during the proof of (1.27) in §2.2, we write for example g0e(102) instead of

gae(sa(k)). Thus, given our hypothesis on j0, j1 and j2 we have:

ψ1ψ0ψ1e(012) = ψ0ψ1ψ0e(012).

(3.42)

Case j0 = j1 6= j2. Let us ﬁrst compute g1g0g1e(012) and g0g1g0e(012). We set

α := f1,(012)f0,(021); we have:

g1g0g1e(012) = f1,(012)g1g0e(021)ψ1

= f1,(012)f0,(021)g1e(201)ψ0ψ1
= αψ1Q1(201)ψ0ψ1e(012) − αP1(201)ψ0ψ1e(012)
(201) − αψ0ψ1e(012)P s0s1

g1g0g1e(012) = αψ1ψ0ψ1e(012)Qs0s1

1

(201).

1

We have already seen that Qs0s1
(201) = P0(012)
(see (2.38)). Hence we obtain, using (3.42) and noticing f1,(012) = f0,(120) and f0,(021) =
f1,(102):

(201) = Q0(012) and similarly we have P s0s1

1

1

g1g0g1e(012) = αψ0ψ1ψ0e(012)Q0(012) − αψ0ψ1e(012)P0(012)

= αψ0ψ1e(102)ψ0Q0(012) − f1,(012)f0,(021)ψ0e(021)ψ1P0(012)
= f1,(102)f0,(120)ψ0e(120)ψ1ψ0Q0(012) − f1,(012)g0ψ1e(012)P0(012)
= f1,(102)g0ψ1e(102)ψ0Q0(012) − g0g1P0(012)e(012)
= g0g1(ψ0Q0(012) − P0(012))e(012)

g1g0g1e(012) = g0g1g0e(012),

so we are done.

Case j0 6= j1 = j2. Similar.

Case j0 = j2 6= j1. Given those hypothesis we have:

0e(012) = ψ2
ψ2

1e(012) = e(012).

(3.43)

17

Hence, using (3.43), with α := f1,(012)f1,(201):

g1g0g1e(012) = f1,(012)g1(ψ0Q0(021) − P0(021))e(021)ψ1

= f1,(012)g1e(201)ψ0Q0(021)ψ1 − f1,(012)g1e(021)P0(021)ψ1
= αψ1ψ0ψ1e(012)Qs1
0 (021)
= αψ0ψ1ψ0e(012)Qs0
1 (102)
= αψ0e(120)ψ1Q1(102)ψ0 − αψ0e(102)P1(102)ψ0.

0 (021) − αψ2
1 (102) − αψ2

1e(012)P s1
0e(012)P s0

Noticing f1,(012) = f0,(120) = f0,(102) and f1,(201) = f0,(012) we get ﬁnally:

g1g0g1e(012) = f0,(012)g0(ψ1Q1(102) − P1(102))e(102)ψ0

= f0,(012)g0g1ψ0e(012)

g1g0g1e(012) = g0g1g0e(012).

Case #{j0, j1, j2} = 3. We get immediately:

g1g0g1e(012) = f1,(201)f0,(021)f1,(012)ψ1ψ0ψ1e(012)

= f0,(120)f1,(102)f0,(012)ψ0ψ1ψ0e(012) = g0g1g0e(012),

since f1,(201) = f0,(012) and f0,(021) = f1,(102) and f1,(012) = f0,(120).

(1.8). Since it is clear that Xa+1Xa = XaXa+1, it remains to prove that qXa+1 = gaXaga
(in fact we prove the relation for every 1 ≤ a ≤ n). As we proved (1.5), it suﬃces to prove
(1.14). Let (i, j) ∈ K α and let us prove:

gaXa+1e(i, j) =(Xagae(i, j) + (q − 1)Xa+1e(i, j)

Xagae(i, j)

if ja = ja+1,
if ja 6= ja+1.

Again, we deduce the case ja = ja+1 from Remark 3.1. If ja 6= ja+1 we have, using (1.20)

and (1.24):

gaXa+1e(i, j) = qia+1 gae(i, j)(1 − ya+1)

= qia+1 fa,jψa(1 − ya+1)e(i, j)
= qia+1 fa,j(1 − ya)e(sa(i, j))ψa
= fa,jXaψae(i, j)

gaXa+1e(i, j) = Xagae(i, j).

(1.9). We prove in fact (1.13), that is gaXb = Xbga for b 6= a, a + 1. As yb commutes with
ψa by (1.22) we have, for any k ∈ K α (where ya(k) := ya(i) with k = (i, j)):

gaXbe(k) = gae(k)yb(k)

= yb(k)(ψaQa(k) − Pa(k))e(k)
= yb(k)e(sa(k))ψaQa(k) − yb(k)e(k)Pa(k)

gaXbe(k) = Xbgae(k),

since yb(k)e(sa(k)) = q(sa(i))b (1 − yb)e(sa(k)) = qib (1 − yb)e(sa(k)) = Xbe(sa(k)).

(1.10). We prove in fact Xatb = tbXa for every a, b; that is straightforward from (1.19).

18

(1.11). We have, using (1.18) and (1.19):

(X1 − qi)

1 (1 − y1) − qi(cid:17)Λi

Noticing that for each i′ ∈ I α the term for i = i′

1 vanishes by (1.17), we get the result.

Isomorphism theorem

We give now the main result of our paper.

4.1 Statement

Theorem 4.1. There is a presentation of the algebra bYΛ

and the relations (1.17)–(1.27), that is we have an algebra isomorphism:

α (q) given by the generators (1.16)

HΛ

α(q).

α(Γ) ∼−→ bYΛ
d,n(q) = ⊕α|=KnbYΛ
n (Γ) := Mα|=Kn

HΛ

As ﬁnitely many bYΛ

many HΛ
Hecke algebra of degree n by:

α(q) are non-zero. Hence, asbYΛ

HΛ

α (q) are non-zero, we deduce from this isomorphism that only ﬁnitely
α(q), deﬁning the cyclotomic quiver

(generated by y1, . . . , yn, ψ1, . . . , ψn−1 and the e(k) for k ∈ K n, together with the usual
deﬁning relations), we get the unitary algebra isomorphism with the cyclotomic Yokonuma–
Hecke algebra:

HΛ

d,n(q).

d,n(q′) are isomorphic.

d,n(q) which does not depend on q, we get

the following corollary (see Corollary 5.15 for a slight improvement).

Corollary 4.2. The cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke inherits the grading of the cyclotomic
quiver Hecke algebra.

n (Γ) ≃ bYΛ
Moreover, as we obtain a presentation of bYΛ
Corollary 4.3. Let q′ ∈ F \ {0, 1}. If charq′ (F ) = charq(F ) then the algebras bYΛ

α(q) → bYΛ

Let us now prove Theorem 4.1. First, as we have a (non-unitary) algebra homomorphism
α(q), that we still call σ.
α(Γ) and
α(q). Since these are algebra homomorphisms, it suﬃces to prove that they are
identity on generators. To clarify the proof, let us add a Y on the quiver Hecke generators
α(q) (there isn’t any confusion

d,n(q), we get an algebra homomorphism bYΛ
α(Γ) → bYΛ

α(q) and a H on the Yokonuma–Hecke generators of HΛ

possible with the former notation since we won’t use it any more).

α (q) verify σ ◦ ρ = idHΛ

α(q) → HΛ

α(q) → HΛ

α(Γ) and ρ : HΛ

4.2 Proof of σ ◦ ρ = idHΛ
We have to check that σ(ρ(e(k))) = e(k) for all k ∈ K α, that σ(ρ(ya)) = ya for all 1 ≤ a ≤ n
and that σ(ρ(ψa)) = ψa for all 1 ≤ a < n.

a ya)e(i′) so:

eY(k), so we have to prove σ(eY(k)) = e(k). Let M := HΛ

Let us start by ﬁnding the image of e(k) by σ ◦ ρ. By deﬁnition of ρ we have ρ(e(k)) =
α(Γ); the algebra homomorphism
α(Q)-module, ﬁnite-dimensional thanks to Proposition 1.4. If
M (k) denotes the weight space as in (2.28), by Remark 2.2 we know that the projection
onto M (k) along ⊕k′6=kM (k′) is given by σ(eY(k)). We prove that e(k) is this projection
too.

Since ya is nilpotent, thanks to (1.18) we have:

σ gives M a structure of bYΛ
Let (i, j) ∈ K α. For 1 ≤ a ≤ n, we have σ(Xa) =Pi′ (qi′
a yai e(i′).
(σ(Xa) − qia ) =Xi′ h(qi′

e(i′) M,
M (i) :=(cid:8)v ∈ M : (σ(Xa) − qia )N v = 0 ∀a(cid:9) = e(i)M.

hence, for N ≫ 0 we have:

In a similar way we have M (j) = e(j)M where M (j) := {v ∈ M : (σ(ta) − ξja )v = 0 ∀a},

a − qia ) − qi′

a=ia

thus:

M (k) = e(k)M.

Hence, as ⊕kM (k) = M we conclude that e(k) is the desired projection and ﬁnally

e(k) = σ(eY(k)).

The end of the proof is without any diﬃculty. We have:

σ(ρ(ya)) = σ(yY

σ(ρ(ψa)) = ψa.

Thus, we have σ(QY

σ(ρ(ψa)) = σ(ψY

[(ψaQa(k) − Pa(k)) + Pa(k)]Qa(k)−1e(k)

It is even easier: we have to check ρ(σ(ga)) = ga for 1 ≤ a < n and ρ(σ(Xa)) = Xa and
ρ(σ(ta)) = ta for 1 ≤ a ≤ n. We have:

α (q)

4.3 Proof of ρ ◦ σ = idbYΛ

taeY(j) = ta.

The proof of Theorem 4.1 is now over.

4.4 Further works

We give here a trailer of our further works.

• Suppose that q is an indeterminate and set F := C(q). We consider the case Λ :=
(Λi)i∈I with Λi := 1 if i = 0 and 0 otherwise, and we deﬁne Yd,n(q) the corresponding
cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebra (that we denote by Hn(q) when d = 1). Finally,
we write |=d instead of |=J (recall that J = Z/dZ).
In [JaPA], Jacon and Poulain d’Andecy have proved the following algebra isomorphism:

Yd,n(q) ≃ Mµ|=dn

Matmµ Hµ(q),

where Hµ(q) := Hµ1 (q) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Hµd (q). Inspired by our Theorem 4.1 we may prove,
with a similar proof to [JaPA], the following isomorphism:

Hn(Γ) ≃ Mµ|=dn

MatmµHµ(Γ),

(4.44)

where Hµ(Γ) := Hµ1 (Γ1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Hµd(Γd) with Γ := ∐j∈J Γj where Γi are arbitrary
quivers. We shall also prove such an isomorphism for cyclotomic quotients, and thus
generalise [JaPA, Theorem 3.1].

• This previous isomorphism of [JaPA] can also be recovered through the work of Lusztig
[Lu, §34]. We shall investigate whether the results of Lusztig, together with (4.44),
can provide isomorphisms between some known algebras and some (cyclotomic) quiver
Hecke algebras.

5 Degenerate case

In this section, we extend the previous results to the case q = 1. In particular, we need to
deﬁne a new “degenerate” cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebra. Many calculations are not
written, since they are entirely similar to the non-degenerate case. Note the following thing:
since the cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebra has no q in its presentation, we do not need to
deﬁne some new cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebra.

5.1 Degenerate cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebras

We introduce here the degenerate cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebra: this algebra can be

seen as the rational degeneration of the cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebra bYΛ

and ﬁnally the cyclotomic one:

(x1 − i)Λi = 0.

Yi∈I

We obtained this presentation by setting Xa = 1 + (q − 1)xa in bYΛ

d,n(q), simplifying by
(1 − q) as much as we can and then setting q = 1 (according to the transformation made
by Drinfeld [Dr] to deﬁne degenerate Hecke algebras). As in the non-degenerate case, the
element ea is a central and veriﬁes e2
a = ea. Finally, note some consequences of (5.49) and
(5.53):

xa+1 = faxafa + faea,
xa+1fa = faxa + ea.

(5.57)
(5.58)

When d = 1, we recover the degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebra bHΛ
the degenerate cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke algebra bYΛ

becomes 1, and fa (respectively xb) is the element sa (resp. xb) of [BrKl, §3].

Proof. We deduce (5.59) from diﬀerent previous relations. The relations (5.60) and (5.61)
can be proved by an easy induction. The equality (5.62) follows ﬁnally from these previous
equalities.

As the elements ga for 1 ≤ a < n verify the same braid relations as the sa ∈ Sn, for each
d,n(1) which does not depend on

the reduced expression w = si1 · · · sir .

w ∈ Sn there is a well-deﬁned element gw := gi1 · · · gir ∈ bYΛ

family, it suﬃces to prove that the F -vector space V spanned by these elements is stable

(5.56).

a, u′

Let now M be a ﬁnite-dimensional bYΛ

d,n(1)-module; it is a ﬁnite-dimensional F -vector
space thanks to Proposition 5.2. By (5.56), the eigenvalues of x1 on M belong to I. We
prove in Lemma 5.4 that all the xa have in fact their eigenvalues in I: this is the degenerate
analogue of [CuWa, Lemma 5.2], which we used in §2.1.

Lemma 5.3. We have:

xaφa = φaxa+1,

φ2
a = (xa+1 − xa − ea)(xa − xa+1 − ea),

where φa is the “intertwining operator” deﬁned by:

φa := fa(xa − xa+1) + ea.

Proof. These are straightforward calculations. We have, using (5.53):

xaφa = (faxa+1 − ea)(xa − xa+1) + xaea

= fa(xa − xa+1)xa+1 + xa+1ea

xaφa = φaxa+1,

and:

φ2
a = fa(xa − xa+1)fa(xa − xa+1) + 2fa(xa − xa+1)ea + ea

= fa(faxa+1 − ea − faxa − ea)(xa − xa+1) + 2fa(xa − xa+1)ea + ea
= (xa+1 − xa)(xa − xa+1) + ea

φ2
a = (xa+1 − xa − ea)(xa − xa+1 − ea).

Lemma 5.4. The eigenvalues of xa belong to I for every 1 ≤ a ≤ n.

23

Proof. We proceed by induction on a. The proposition is true for a = 1; we suppose that
it is true for some 1 ≤ a < n. Let λ be an eigenvalue of xa+1 (in a algebraic closure of
F ). As the family {xa, xa+1, ea} is commutative, we can ﬁnd a common eigenvector v in
the eigenspace of xa+1 associated with λ: we have xav = iv and eav = δv for some i ∈ I
(by induction hypothesis) and δ ∈ {0, 1} (since e2
a = ea). We distinguish now whether φav
vanishes or not:

• if φav 6= 0, we get by Lemma 5.3:

xa(φav) = φa(xa+1v) = λφav,

hence λ is an eigenvalue for xa and by induction hypothesis we get λ ∈ I;

• if φav = 0, by the same lemma we have:

φ2
av = (λ − i − δ)(i − λ − δ)v = 0,

hence λ = ±i + δ ∈ I.

5.2 Quiver Hecke generators of bYΛ

d,n(1)

We proceed as in Section 2: we deﬁne some central idempotents, then some “quiver Hecke
generators” on which we check the deﬁning relations of HΛ
α(Γ). The proofs are entirely
similar to the non-degenerate case (even easier; note that once again the “hard work” has
been made in [BrKl]), hence we won’t write them. However, we will still deﬁne the diﬀerent
involved elements.

5.2.1

Image of e(i, j)

Let M be a ﬁnite-dimensional bYΛ

d,n(1)-module. We know that the ta are diagonalizable
with eigenvalues in J. Hence, recalling Lemma 5.4, we can write (recall that the family
{Xa, ta}1≤a≤n is commutative):

M = M(i,j)∈I n×J n

M (i, j),

with:

M (i, j) :=(cid:8)v ∈ M : (xa − ia)N v = (ta − ξja )v = 0 for all 1 ≤ a ≤ n(cid:9) ,

with N ≫ 0; only ﬁnitely many M (i, j) are non-zero (since M is a ﬁnite-dimensional F -vector
space). Considering once again the associated family of projections {e(k)}k∈K n associated
with M = ⊕k∈K nM (k), we deﬁne for α |=K n:

e[α] := Xk∈K α

e(k),

and we set bYΛ

α(1) := e[α]bYΛ

d,n(1). We can now deﬁne, for i ∈ I α and j ∈ J α:

e[α](i) := Xj∈J α
e[α](j) := Xi∈I α

e[α]e(i, j),

e[α]e(i, j).

(5.63)

In particular, with e[α](i) for d = 1 we recover the element e(i) of [BrKl, §3.1].

should be multiplied by e[α] and we write e(i) and e(j) without any [α].

From now, unless something else is mentioned we always work in bYΛ

α(1); every relation

24

Lemma 5.5. If 1 ≤ a < n and j ∈ J α is such that ja 6= ja+1 then we have:

faxa+1e(j) = xafae(j),
xa+1fae(j) = faxae(j).

Lemma 5.6. For 1 ≤ a < n and j ∈ J α we have fae(j) = e(sa(j))fa. In particular, if
ja = ja+1 then fa and e(j) commute. Moreover, if ja 6= ja+1 then fae(i, j) = e(sa(i, j))fa.

Remark 5.7 (About Brundan and Kleshchev’s proof - III). Let 1 ≤ a < n; if j ∈ J α veriﬁes
ja = ja+1, when a proof in [BrKl, §3.3] needs only the elements fa, xb, e(i) and the associated
α(1)e(j). We extend this

relations in bHΛ

α(1), we claim that the same proof holds in e(j)bYΛ

claim to the case ja = ja+1 = ja+2.

5.2.2

Image of ya

We deﬁne the following elements of bYΛ
ya := Xi∈I α

α (1) for 1 ≤ a ≤ n:

(xa − ia)e(i) ∈ bYΛ

α(1).

When d = 1 we recover the elements deﬁned in [BrKl, §3.3]. These elements are nilpotent:

we will be able to make calculations in the ring F [[y1, . . . , yn]].
Lemma 5.8. For j ∈ J α such that ja 6= ja+1 we have:

faya+1e(j) = yafae(j),
ya+1fae(j) = fayae(j).

5.2.3

Image of ψa

We ﬁrst deﬁne some elements pa(i, j) ∈ F [[ya, ya+1]] for 1 ≤ a < n and (i, j) ∈ K α by:

and then some invertible elements qa(i, j) ∈ F [[ya, ya+1]]× for 1 ≤ a < n and (i, j) ∈ K α by:

α(1)e(k). In partic-

ϕa = Xk∈K α

(fa + pa(k))e(k).

Moreover, for d = 1 the element ϕa is the “intertwining element” deﬁned in [BrKl, §3.2].

Lemma 5.10. We have the following properties:

ϕae(j) = e(sa(j))ϕa,

ϕae(i, j) = e(sa(i, j))ϕa,

ϕaxb = xbϕa
ϕayb = ybϕa

∀b 6= a, a + 1,

∀b 6= a, a + 1,

ϕaqb(k) = qb(k)ϕa

∀|b − a| > 1,

ϕaϕb = ϕbϕa

∀|b − a| > 1.

Our element ψa is deﬁned for 1 ≤ a < n by:

ψa := Xk∈K α

φaqa(k)−1e(k) ∈ bYΛ

α (1).

When d = 1 this element ψa corresponds to the ψa of [BrKl, §3.3]. Note ﬁnally that for

j ∈ J α we have:

ψae(j) = fae(j)

if ja 6= ja+1.

5.2.4 Check of the deﬁning relations

Theorem 5.11. The elements y1, . . . , yn, ψ1, . . . , ψn−1 and e(k) for k ∈ K α verify the
deﬁning relations (1.17)–(1.27) of HΛ

α(Γ).

The painstaking veriﬁcation is exactly the same as in §2.2: we apply Remark 5.7 on the
proof of [BrKl, Theorem 3.2] for the cases ja = ja+1, and when ja 6= ja+1 then entirely
similar (even the same) relations as §2.2 between the diﬀerent elements are veriﬁed. Note
two small diﬀerences with the proof in §2.2:

• we shall write (xa − xb) instead of (1 − q)(1 − XaX −1
• the elements fa,j are equal to 1.

5.3 Degenerate Yokonuma–Hecke generators of HΛ

α(Γ)

We proceed as in Section 3. Once again, the proofs are entirely similar to the non-degenerate
case, hence we do not write them.

First of all, since the elements y1, . . . , yn ∈ HΛ

α(Γ) are nilpotent we can consider power
series in these variables. Hence, the quantities pa(k), qa(k) that we deﬁned in §5.2.3 are also
well-deﬁned as elements of HΛ
α(Γ). We deﬁne ﬁnally as in (5.63) the elements e(i) and e(j)
α(Γ) for i ∈ I α and j ∈ J α.
of HΛ
We recall that ξ is a primitive dth root of unity in F . Our “degenerate Yokonuma–Hecke

generators” of HΛ

α(Γ) are given below.

(ψaqa(k) − pa(k)) e(k)

for 1 ≤ a < n

fa := Xk∈K α
ta := Xj∈J α
xa := Xi∈I α

ξja e(j)

(ya + ia)e(i)

for 1 ≤ a ≤ n

for 1 ≤ a ≤ n

When d = 1, the element fa (respectively xa) is the element sa (resp. xa) of [BrKl, §3.4].

26

Remark 5.12 (About Brundan and Kleshchev’s proof - IV). Let 1 ≤ a < n; if j ∈ J α veriﬁes
ja = ja+1, when a proof in [BrKl, §3.4] needs only the elements ψae(j), ybe(j), e(i, j) and
the associated relations in HΛ
α(Γ)e(j).
We extend this claim to the case ja = ja+1 = ja+2.

α(Γe), we claim that the same proof holds in e(j)HΛ

Finally, similarly to §5.2.4 we have the following theorem. Once again the check of the

various relations is exactly the same as in §3.2.

Theorem 5.13. The elements f1, . . . , fn−1, t1, . . . , tn, x1, . . . , xn verify the deﬁning relations

(1.2)–(1.11) of bYΛ

5.4

d,n(1).

Isomorphism theorem

We give now the degenerate version of Theorem 4.1.

Theorem 5.14. There is a presentation of the degenerate cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke
α (1) given by the generators (1.16) and the relations (1.17)–(1.27), that is we have

algebra bYΛ

an algebra isomorphism:

d,n(1).

HΛ

n (Γ) ∼→bYΛ

α (1) ⊆ bYΛ

by Theorem 5.11 we can deﬁne an algebra homomorphism ρ : HΛ

Together with Theorem 4.1 we get the following corollaries (cf. [BrKl, Corollary 1.3]).

α(Γ) → bYΛ
d,n(1) we deduce an algebra homomorphism σ : bYΛ

d,n(1) → HΛ

The proof of this theorem is entirely similar to the one of Theorem 4.1. In particular,
α(1) and by
α(Γ). From
α(Γ).
We prove then that ρ and σ are inverse homomorphisms, taking the images of the diﬀerent
deﬁning generators.

Theorem 5.13 we can deﬁne another algebra homomorphism σ : bYΛ
the inclusion bYΛ
Corollary 5.15. If q and q′ are two elements of F × with charq(F ) = charq′ (F ) then bYΛ
and bYΛ
algebra bYΛ

Corollary 5.16. If F has characteristic charq(F ) then the cyclotomic Yokonuma–Hecke
d,n(1). This applies in particular

when F has characteristic 0 and q is generic.

d,n(q) is isomorphic to its rational degeneration bYΛ

d,n(q′) are isomorphic algebras.

α(1) → HΛ

d,n(q)
