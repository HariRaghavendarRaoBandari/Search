We study P − V criticality of black holes in Lovelock gravities in the context of horizon ther-
modynamics. The corresponding ﬁrst law of horizon thermodynamics emerges as one of the
Einstein–Lovelock equations and assumes the universal (independent of matter content) form
δE = T δS − P δV , where P is identiﬁed with the total pressure of all matter in the spacetime
(including a cosmological constant Λ if present). We compare this approach to recent advances
in extended phase space thermodynamics of asymptotically AdS black holes where the ‘standard’
ﬁrst law of black hole thermodynamics is extended to include a pressure–volume term, where the
pressure is entirely due to the (variable) cosmological constant. We show that both approaches are
quite diﬀerent in interpretation. Provided there is suﬃcient non-linearity in the gravitational sector,
we ﬁnd that horizon thermodynamics admits the same interesting black hole phase behaviour seen
in the extended case, such as a Hawking–Page transition, Van der Waals like behaviour, and the
presence of a triple point. We also formulate the Smarr formula in horizon thermodynamics and
discuss the interpretation of the quantity E appearing in the horizon ﬁrst law.

I.

INTRODUCTION

That spacetimes with horizons show a remarkable re-
semblance to thermodynamic systems has been a subject
of study since seminal papers of Bekenstein, Hawking,
Bardeen, and Carter [1–4].
In fact, there is a strong
belief that the Einstein ﬁeld equations, describing the
dynamics of gravity, can be interpreted as a thermody-
namic equation of state and have a deep connection with
the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, e.g.
In partic-
ular, it was explicitly shown that Einstein equations on
the horizon of a spherically symmetric spacetimes can be
interpreted as a thermodynamic identity. This was the
origin of horizon thermodynamics [9].

[5–8].

The original observation for spherically symmetric
black holes in Einstein’s gravity [9] has since been ex-
tended to a number of other interesting cases, many of
which have been highlighted in recent reviews [10, 11].
For example, the horizon thermodynamics has been ex-
tended to spherically symmetric black holes in Lovelock
and Quasi-topological gravities [12–15], f (R) gravity [16],
and Horava–Lifshitz gravity [17], to time evolving and
axisymmetric stationary black hole horizons [18, 19], to
horizons in FRW spacetime [20–22] and braneworld sce-
narios [23, 24]. More recently the general thermodynamic
properties of null surfaces have been investigated e.g. in
[25].

In our paper we concentrate on horizon thermodynam-
ics of black holes. The basic idea is as follows. Consider
a spherically symmetric black hole spacetime, written in
standard coordinates, and identify the total pressure P

∗ dhansen@perimeterinstitute.ca
† dkubiznak@perimeterinstitute.ca
‡ rbmann@uwaterloo.ca

with the T r
r component of the energy–momentum ten-
sor of all the matter ﬁelds, including the cosmological
constant, if present. The Einstein equations on the black
hole horizon can then be regarded as an Horizon Equa-
tion of State (HES)

P = P (V, T ) ,

(1)

where T is the temperature of the horizon, identiﬁed for
example through the Euclidean approach. By consider-
ing an inﬁnitesimal virtual displacement of the horizon,
one can demonstrate the Horizon First Law (HFL)

δE = T δS − P δV

(2)

from the radial Einstein equation, where S is the entropy
associated with a given black hole horizon and must be
independently calculated by other means [26, 27]. The
quantities E and V above are respectively interpreted as
an energy and a volume associated with the black hole.
We shall consider the nature of these interpretations and
their underlying assumptions in what follows.

Interestingly, the idea of pressure and volume as well as
that of the equation of state (1) have in recent years been
the subject of much attention in the extended phase space
thermodynamics of asymptotically AdS black holes, see
e.g. [28, 29] for recent short reviews. In this framework
one identiﬁes the cosmological constant as a thermody-
namic variable analogous to pressure [30–33]. Its conju-
gate thermodynamic volume can be obtained via geomet-
ric means by generalizing the ﬁrst law of black hole me-
chanics in spacetimes that have a cosmological constant
[31, 34]. This in turn implies that the mass of an AdS
black hole is the enthalpy of spacetime. This approach
emerged from geometric derivations of the Smarr formula
for AdS black holes [31] and led to a reverse isoperimet-
ric inequality conjecture [33], which states that for ﬁxed

thermodynamic volume, the entropy of an AdS black
hole is maximized for Schwarzchild AdS. This inequal-
ity holds for all known black holes of spherical topology;
exceptions exist if this condition is relaxed [35]. A very
rich and interesting array of thermodynamic behaviour
for both AdS and dS black holes then emerges. Exam-
ples of the so-called P − V criticality include a complete
analogy between 4-dimensional Reissner–N¨ordstrom AdS
black holes and the Van der Waals liquid-gas system [36],
the existence of reentrant phase transitions in rotating
[37] and Born–Infeld [38] black holes, tricritical points in
rotating black holes analogous to the triple point of wa-
ter [39], and isolated critical points in Lovelock gravities
[40, 41]. These phenomena continue to be subject to in-
tensive study in a broad variety of contexts e.g. [42–62].
The goal of this paper is to understand the relationship
between these two approaches to gravitational thermody-
namics. Although both have wider applications, for con-
creteness we focus in this paper on spherically symmetric
black holes in Lovelock gravity. After brieﬂy reviewing
horizon thermodynamics in this setting [12–14, 63] we
i) formulate the horizon equation of state for general K-
th order Lovelock black holes ii) re-derive the correspond-
ing horizon ﬁrst law iii) obtain the corresponding Horizon
Smarr Formula (HSF) and Gibbs free energy and study
the associated P − V criticality, and iv) compare this
procedure and obtained results with the recent advances
on extended phase space thermodynamics. We discuss
the interpretation of the energy E (sometimes referred
as horizon internal energy [12]) that appears in both the
horizon ﬁrst law and the HSF we derive, and relate it to
the gravitational enthalpy.

Our paper is organized as follows.

In the next sec-
tion we derive the horizon equation of state for a generic
Lovelock spherically symmetric black hole. This equa-
tion of state is then ‘upgraded’ to the horizon ﬁrst law
in Sec. III, where also the associated Gibbs free energy
and Smarr relation are studied. P −V criticality is inves-
tigated for various Lovelock gravities in Sec. IV. Sec. V
discusses the relationship to extended phase space ther-
modynamics. Sec. VI is devoted to conclusions.

II. LOVELOCK GRAVITY AND HORIZON

EQUATION OF STATE

Lovelock gravity [64] is a geometric higher curvature
theory of gravity that can be considered as a natural gen-
eralization of Einstein’s theory to higher dimensions—it
is the unique higher-derivative theory that gives rise to
second-order ﬁeld equations for all metric components.
In d spacetime dimensions, the Lagrangian reads

are the Lovelock coupling constants.
In what fol-
lows we identify the (negative) cosmological constant
Λ = −α0/2, and set α1 = 1 to remain consistent with
general relativity. We also assume minimal coupling to
the matter, described by the matter Lagrangian Lm.
The Lovelock equations of motion that follow from the

We shall restrict our attention to spherically symmetric

AdS Lovelock black holes, employing the ansatz [65]

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν = γab(r)dxadxb + r2hijdxidxj ,

(6)

where the non-trivial part of the metric is described by a
2-dimensional metric γab (a, b = 0, 1), while hij (i, j =
2, . . . , d − 1) stands for the line element of a (d − 2)-
dimensional space of constant curvature σ(d − 2)(d − 3),
with σ = +1, 0,−1 for spherical, ﬂat, and hyperbolic ge-
ometries respectively of ﬁnite volume Σd−2, the latter two
cases being compact via identiﬁcation [66–68]. The (a, b)-
components of the kth Lovelock–Einstein tensor then are
[65]

remaining (i, j) components can be found in [65]. As long
as at least one αk (cid:54)= 0 for k > 1 all possible values of σ
yield solutions, even if Λ ∝ α0 = 0.
Consider a black hole for which

which, together with the identiﬁcation (15), gives the
HES for Lovelock gravity, P = P (V, T ). Note that to
write down this equation of state one does not need to
know the explicit form of f . Furthermore, equation (15)
is an ansatz in this approach that has to be justiﬁed (sim-
ilar to the prescription for temperature T ) by some other
means, e.g. [33, 69–71].

is regarded as an energy associated with the black hole,
whose interpretation we discuss below. This ﬁrst law is
equivalent to the equation of motion (11) evaluated on
the horizon.

g(r+) = 0 ,

f(cid:48)(r+) = g(cid:48)(r+)

is required in order that the surface r = r+ be a reg-
ular horizon null surface and not a singularity. Noted
previously for the Einstein equations [9, 18], this condi-
tion must hold for any Lovelock theory in the spherically
symmetric case, and follows from evaluating the trace
gµνG(k)
µν of each term in the equations of motion (5). It
is straightforward to show that each one of these traces
contains a term proportional to the Ricci scalar R(γ) for
the metric (8), which is singular at the horizon unless
(13) holds.

Horizon thermodynamics is based on the proposal that
the energy–momentum tensor on the horizon is inter-
preted as

Pm ≡ T r

r|r=r+ .

(14)

with the assumption that

Σd−2rd−1

where the ‘potentials’ Ψ(k) are the thermodynamic con-
jugates to the αk quantities. Their presence (relevant
for K > 1) is required for (24) to hold, and can be de-
rived from the HFL by an Euler scaling argument, where
E = E(S, V ) is regarded as a function of entropy and
volume, provided the former is extended to include the
variations of the couplings [73] (that will not play a signif-
icant role in what follows). This yields the term (d−1)P V
in (24), since V ∝ Ld−1.

Having identiﬁed the horizon internal energy, we can
now deﬁne the horizon enthalpy H, and the horizon Gibbs
free energy G according to standard thermodynamic pre-
scription,

H = E + P V , G = E − T S + P V

and these satisfy

δH = T δS + V δP ,

δG = −SδT + V δP

(25)

(26)

using the HFL (22). Note that insertion of (25) into (24)
yields

(d−3)H = (d−2)T S−2P V +

2(k − 1)αkΨ(k) . (27)

k=2

Similar to the HFL, both the HSF (24) and its Legendre
equivalent (27) are valid irrespective of the matter con-
tent. We note that the coeﬃcient of the P V term in (27)
has the same value as that in the extended phase space
approach [31, 42].

Criticality and possible phase transitions depend on

the behaviour of

G = G(P, T )

(28)

which can be (parametrically) obtained by inverting the
equation of state, yielding

In this way one can study the behaviour of the Gibbs
free energy and the potential criticality regardless of the
actual knowledge of the matter content of the theory. We
stress that P is not necessarily positive (for example in
the vacuum dS case P has to be negative) and to map all
the possible scenarios it makes sense to study all three
cases of positive, zero, or negative pressure.
It is the
actual matter content of a given theory that imposes as-
sociated restrictions on the possible pressure interval and
gives the phase diagram a concrete physical interpreta-
tion, as we shall demonstrate in the sequel.

IV. P − V CRITICALITY: SOME EXAMPLES

Before proceeding to a general comparison between
horizon thermodynamics and the extended phase space
approach, we shall consider some examples. Speciﬁcally,
we illustrate the possible behaviour of the horizon Gibbs
free energy and the associated variety of interesting phase
transitions that occur in the horizon thermodynamics of
spherically symmetric black holes in ﬁrst few lower-order
Lovelock gravities (small values of K), generalizing re-
cent results for the Gauss-Bonnet case [63].

A. Einstein gravity

We start with an example from Einstein gravity (K =
1) in d = 4 dimensions (similar results hold in higher d).
Irrespective of the matter content, the equation of state
(19) reads

P =

and satisfy the horizon ﬁrst laws (22) and (26).

The behaviour of the horizon Gibbs free energy is for
σ = 1 displayed in Fig. 1. Whereas for P > 0 we observe
a shape characteristic for the Hawking–Page transition of
Schwarzschild-AdS black holes [74] (illustrated in Fig. 4),
for P = 0 and P < 0 we see that G is relatively simple
and respectively reminiscent of what happens for asymp-
totically dS and asymptotically ﬂat (uncharged) black
holes [42, 43]. However, this similarity is only super-
ﬁcial and the actual physical interpretation depends on
the matter content of the theory, as we shall demonstrate
below. No other interesting phase behaviour is possible
for σ = 1.

stein black holes. The G − T diagram is displayed for
P = 0.03 (red curve), P = 0 (black curve) and P = −0.2
(blue curve). For positive pressures we observe a characteris-
tic shape reminiscent of the Hawking–Page behavior.

Gauss–Bonnet black holes. The G − T diagram is dis-
played for P = 0.01 (red dash curve), P = 0.0025 (red solid

α2 = 1. For small positive pressures we observe a character-
istic swallow tail reminiscent of the Van der Waals-like phase
transition.

B. Gauss–Bonnet gravity

Carrying out the same analysis in Gauss–Bonnet grav-
ity (K = 2) in d = 5 dimensions, the equation of state
reads

for P = 0 and P < 0 we observe a cusp (corresponding to
a divergent speciﬁc heat) and the shape of G = G(T ) re-
minds that of the charged asymptotically dS and asymp-
totically ﬂat black holes, c.f. [42, 43].

The corresponding G−T diagram for spherical (σ = 1)
black holes is displayed in Fig. 2.
In contrast to the
K = 1 case, we now see that the additional gravitational
non-linearity can yield more interesting phase behaviour.
Namely, for suﬃciently small positive pressures [40, 63]

0 < P < Pc =

1

96πα2

,

(35)

we observe a characteristic swallow tail reminiscent of the
Van der Waals-like phase transition for d = 4 charged
black holes in extended phase space [36], illustrated in
Fig. 5. For P > Pc the swallow tail disappears and the
Gibbs free energy becomes smooth. On the other hand

C. Higher-order Lovelock gravity

For K > 2 we ﬁnd further interesting phase behaviour.
At each additional order in the Lovelock expansion, we
gain an additional degree of freedom corresponding to
the additional Lovelock coupling αK, allowing for more
complex structures to arise. We ﬁnd phenomena similar
to those seen previously in extended phase space ther-
modynamics for K = 1, such as reentrant phase tran-
sitions [37], double swallow tails and a corresponding
triple point [39],and even (for K > 2) isolated critical
points [40, 41, 57]. However in contrast to the extended
phase space approach, such behaviour in horizon thermo-
dynamics is entirely due to the non-linearity of gravity
(the larger values of K), fully independent of the mat-
ter distribution. We depict a triple point in 4-th order
Lovelock gravity in Fig. 3.

It remains an interesting open question whether the
horizon thermodynamics of higher-order Lovelock theo-
ries can bring some additional qualitatively new phase
transitions to those described in this section. In partic-
ular, can one ﬁnd ‘n-tuple swallow tails’ and the corre-
sponding n-tuple critical points? We leave this question
for future work.

corresponding electric potentials Φi. The horizon tem-
perature T and associated entropy S are the same as in
the horizon thermodynamics approach.

(cid:80)

Let us now study some diﬀerences between the HFL
(22) and the extended ﬁrst law (36). The most obvi-
ous distinction is the appearance of extra work terms,
i ΦiδQi, in (36).2 These terms in the horizon case (22)
are instead interpreted as contributions to the pressure,
which is associated with all matter ﬁelds. In the extended
case (36) one only has a completely isotropic pressure due
to the cosmological constant.

A more important diﬀerence between (22) and (36) is
the nature of the black hole volume. In the horizon ap-
proach V is assumed to be given by (15); it is associated
with the ‘Euclidean geometric volume’ of the black hole
and is independent of the matter content, c.f. [33, 69–71].
In contrast to this the volume in extended thermodynam-
ics

(cid:16) ∂M

(cid:17)

VTD =

∂PΛ

S,Q1,...

(38)

is a thermodynamic volume [33], a quantity conjugate to
the pressure PΛ. Hence VTD is not an independent input
but directly follows from the identiﬁcation of the black
hole mass. It can also depend on the matter content of
the theory; for example the thermodynamic volumes of
supergravity black holes have this feature [33].

Another important diﬀerence is the nature and dis-
tinction between the quantities E, H, and M . Whereas
the latter is the black hole mass and can be calculated by
standard methods, e.g. the method of conformal comple-
tion [75, 76], the physical meaning of E is not clear. It
evidently plays the role of energy in (22), but this quan-
tity is not the mass of black hole; indeed its properties are
quite diﬀerent. It vanishes for planar/toroidal black holes
(for which σ = 0) and can be negative for higher-genus
topological/hyperbolic black holes (for which σ = −1).
It has been noted that it is associated with the transverse
geometry of the horizon [12].

Since it is a function only of the horizon curvature σ
and the horizon radius r+, we propose that it is the hori-
zon curvature energy: the energy required to warp space
time so that it embeds an horizon. This deﬁnition is
analogous to that of the spatial curvature density in cos-
mology, which depends only on the curvature of spatial
slices at constant time in an FRW cosmology. Likewise,
the horizon enthalpy H then can be interpreted as the
energy required to both warp spacetime and displace its
matter content so that a black hole can be created.

FIG. 3. Horizon thermodynamics: triple point. The
G−T diagram is displayed for a spherical black hole in the 4-th
order Lovelock gravity for the following choice of parameters:
α2 = 0.2, α3 = 2.8, α4 = 1, P = 0.000425. We observe two
swallow tails merging together, characterizing an existence of
a triple point.

V. COMPARISON TO EXTENDED

THERMODYNAMICS WITH VARIABLE Λ

In this section we shall compare horizon thermody-
namics to the recently studied (canonical ensemble) ex-
tended phase space thermodynamics of asymptotically
AdS black holes. The latter, sometimes referred to as
black hole chemistry [28], is essentially ‘standard black
hole thermodynamics’ with the additional feature that
the (negative) cosmological constant is treated as an ad-
ditional thermodynamic variable, which is interpreted as
a thermodynamic pressure PΛ according to Eq. (17) and
allowed to vary in the corresponding ﬁrst law. The ﬁrst
law for spherically symmetric Lovelock black holes then
takes the following form [73]:

δM = T δS +

ΦiδQi + VTDδPΛ +

Ψ(k)δαk , (36)

and implies the associated Smarr formula

through the Euler scaling argument. Here M stands for
the black hole mass, now interpreted as a gravitational
enthalpy, distinct from the enthalpy deﬁned in (25). We
have also included the possibility that the black holes
are multiply-charged with several U (1) charges Qi and

2 Note that in (36) we have also included the possibility of variable
δαk, which are needed to relate the ﬁrst law to the Smarr rela-
tion (37) through the Euler scaling argument. These terms are
not natural in the horizon thermodynamics description. In what
follows we simply ignore them even for the extended phase space
description as they are not central for our further discussion.

In particular, using (27) and (37), we ﬁnd the following

relation between M and H:

M = H + QΦ +

(40)

as the relationship between mass and horizon enthalpy
H.

If no matter apart from a cosmological constant is
present Pm = 0. H and M then represent the same
quantities, and so

H = M = E + PΛV

(41)

which is the sum of the energy E needed for warping
the spacetime to embed the black hole horizon plus the
energy PΛV needed to place the black hole into a cosmo-
logical environment (‘to displace the vacuum energy’).
Note that for planar black holes E vanishes and the mass
is entirely given by the PΛV term.

We pause to comment that the quantity E is related
to the generalized Misner–Sharp mass mMS = mMS(r)
[65, 77]

mMS(r+) = PΛV + E = M

(42)

evaluated on the black hole horizon [19]. The last equal-
ity follows from (41) (which holds for Pm = 0), and so we
see that the mass of a Schwarzschild AdS black hole is
the Misner–Sharp mass on the horizon. Setting Pm (cid:54)= 0,
it has been shown that mMS(r+) satisﬁes the HFL [7, 19].
Criticality and possible phase transitions in the frame-
work of extended phase space are governed by the asso-
ciated Gibbs free energy

GΛ = M − T S ,

(43)

in comparison to the horizon Gibbs free energy G (25).
In particular, and obvious from the above discussion,
in the vacuum with negative cosmological constant case
we have the same expressions

G = GΛ , P = PΛ

(44)

for the Gibbs free energy and equation of state. Only
in this case and for positive P do the two approaches
yield the same kind of thermodynamic behaviour and
phase transitions (Van der Waals behaviour, reentrant
transitions, triple points, isolated critical points) in any
Lovelock theory. These phenomena will only take place
for suﬃciently large K (suﬃcient gravitational non-
linearity).

The two approaches diﬀer signiﬁcantly once matter is
introduced. Generically they give rise to very distinct

7

phase diagrams with completely diﬀerent physical inter-
pretations. The diﬀerence is rooted in the inherent de-
generacy in horizon thermodynamics: it is described by
only two parameters T and P (together with their con-
jugates). This degeneracy is removed in extended phase
space thermodynamics, with each matter ﬁeld having its
own contribution to the free-energy, leading to a descrip-
tion in a diﬀerent (often incompatible) thermodynamic
ensemble. Furthermore, in horizon thermodynamics neg-
ative pressures are possible even if Λ < 0, whereas in the
extended case negative pressure requires Λ > 0.

We shall now illustrate these distinctions for a spherical

namically dominate for large temperatures, T > THP, over the
radiation phase displayed by horizontal magenta line. Note
that (being in the framework of extended phase space ther-
modynamics) each point on the black hole curve corresponds
to diﬀerent black holes (of increasing horizon radius r+ from
right on the dashed blue curve to bottom left) in the same

FIG. 5. Van der Waals-like phase transition. The char-
acteristic GΛ−T diagram is displayed for the charged (Q = 1)
AdS spherical black hole in d = 4. For suﬃciently small pres-
sures, P < Pc = 1/[96πQ2], the GΛ − T diagram displays
the characteristic swallow tail behaviour indicating a small
to large black hole phase transition ala Van der Waals. As
with Fig. 4 , each point on the curve corresponds to diﬀer-
ent black holes (of increasing horizon radius r+ from left to
bottom right) in the same environment of ﬁxed Λ and Q.

These relations imply fundamentally diﬀerent thermo-
dynamic behaviour in the two approaches. Even after
removing the degeneracy in (47) by imposing a constant
Q constraint, the P = const and PΛ = const slices of
thermodynamic phase space are incompatible, and yield
diﬀerent behaviour of the Gibbs free energies G(T ) and
GΛ(T ). We shall illustrate this point by comparing the
positive pressure curve in Fig. 1 describing the behaviour
of G in horizon thermodynamics to that of GΛ display-
ing the Hawking–Page transition for Q = 0 and the Van
der Waals like behavior for Q (cid:54)= 0 in the extended phase
space thermodynamics, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.
In horizon thermodynamics the description is in terms
only of {T, P}, and only ‘Hawking–Page-like behavior’ of
the horizon Gibbs free energy G = G(P, T ) can be ob-
served, as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, as T changes,
moving along a constant-P curve entails modifying some
combination of Q, r+, and Λ: diﬀerent points on the
curve are comparing diﬀerent black holes in diﬀerent en-
vironments4. The expected transition at G = 0 to pure
radiation (which has Q = 0) can only occur if there is a

3 Note that the extended phase space equation of state (49) was
directly derived from the horizon equation of state (31) by split-
ting P = Pm + PΛ,. This is not true for the Gibbs free energy
GΛ.

4 Since constant-P undetermined condition, its realization can be
always achieved by setting Q = 0 and tuning Λ accordingly. For
this reason it is not that surprising that the horizon Gibbs free
energy mimics the Q = 0 behavior of the extended phase space
Gibbs free energy.

reservoir of charge, so that Q can appropriately vanish
as this transition takes place.

In other words, the physical interpretation of Fig. 1 in
horizon thermodynamics depends crucially on the matter
content.
In contrast to this, the extended phase-space
picture breaks this degeneracy, allowing for imposition
of independent constraints on Q and the pressure PΛ. If
Q = 0 (Fig. 4) the standard Hawking–Page phase tran-
sition is recovered [28], whereas for ﬁxed Q (cid:54)= 0 (Fig. 5),
Van der Waals-like behaviour is observed [36], with the
Gibbs free energy GΛ = GΛ(PΛ, T, Q) exhibiting a swal-
lowtail structure. In either case, each point on the curve
in a GΛ vs. T diagram corresponds to diﬀerent black
holes in the same environment (the same Λ and Q).

We see that the distinction between the two approaches
in this example is reminiscent of the canonical vs. grand-
canonical description of charged AdS black holes. For a
charged AdS black hole we observe Van der Waals phase
transitions only in a canonical (ﬁxed Q) ensemble (as
in the extended phase space approach), whereas in the
grand canonical (ﬁxed Φ) ensemble behaviour similar to
Fig. 1 is observed (as in horizon thermodynamics).

In summary, horizon thermodynamics describes a sys-
tem from the viewpoint of an ensemble described by only
two variables P and T . The Gibbs free energy therefore
only depends on the type of gravity considered. Such
a description is ‘universal’ and ‘formally independent’ of
the matter content. However, the actual interpretation
of the thermodynamic behaviour is matter dependent. In
general it is not unique due to the degeneracy of the de-
scription, in contrast to the non-degenerate description
in extended phase space thermodynamics. Even after
the degeneracy is removed, horizon thermodynamics of-
ten leads to a diﬀerent ensemble description, incompati-
ble with extended phase space thermodynamics.

VI. DISCUSSION

We have reviewed the horizon thermodynamics ap-
proach to the thermodynamics of spherically symmetric
black holes in Lovelock gravity and compared it to the
extended phase space approach. The key idea of hori-
zon thermodynamics is to rewrite the Einstein equations
evaluated on the black hole horizon as a thermodynamic
identity, obtaining an horizon equation of state together
with a ﬁrst law of horizon thermodynamics. The ex-
plicit form of this law depends on identifying the black
hole volume, black hole entropy, and the temperature.
The ﬁrst law then deﬁnes a quantity E, which we have
proposed is the horizon curvature energy: the energy re-

9

quired to warp space time so that it embeds an horizon.
By employing an Euler scaling argument we also derived
the Horizon Smarr Formula (24), as well as obtained the
horizon enthalpy H and Gibbs free energy G. The latter
allows one to study P − V criticality in horizon thermo-
dynamics.
Comparing this to the recently studied P − V criti-
cality in the context of asymptotically AdS black holes
(so-called black hole chemistry [28]), we ﬁnd that the two
approaches are quite diﬀerent, in general leading to in-
compatible thermodynamic descriptions of the same sys-
tem. Horizon thermodynamics intrinsically contains a
degeneracy amongst thermodynamic variables that are
distinct in the extended phase space approach. Only in
the vacuum with negative cosmological constant do the
two approaches lead to identical thermodynamics.

We have also shown that increasing non-linearity in
the gravitational sector yields more interesting thermo-
dynamic behaviour, and in this sense it is possible in hori-
zon thermodynamics to recover phenomena previously
observed in black hole chemistry. While this description
might appear to be ‘universal’ and ‘formally independent’
of the matter content, in fact the interpretation of these
phenomena in horizon thermodynamics will depend on
the matter content of the theory.
Our study opens the possibility for studying P − V
criticality and associated phase transitions of black holes
in various theories in the horizon thermodynamics con-
text. Whereas in this paper we have concentrated on
spherically symmetric black holes in Lovelock gravity, an
interesting future study would be to consider a similar
investigations for black holes in Lifshitz, f (R), quasi-
topological, and other theories of gravity. Another inter-
esting future direction would be to go beyond the realm
of black hole thermodynamics and consider for example
the criticality of horizon thermodynamics for acceleration
and cosmological horizons.
If horizon thermodynamics
indeed elicits universal features of ‘any horizon’, P − V
criticality should be a universal feature of all gravita-
tional theories.
