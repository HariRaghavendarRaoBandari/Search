We consider the Standard Model extended with a dark matter particle in curved spacetime,
motivated by the fact that the only current evidence for dark matter is through its gravitational
interactions, and we investigate the impact on the dark matter stability of terms in the Lagrangian
linear in the dark matter ﬁeld and proportional to the Ricci scalar. We show that this “gravity
portal” induces decay even if the dark matter particle only has gravitational interactions, and that
the decay branching ratios into Standard Model particles only depend on one free parameter: the
dark matter mass. We study in detail the case of a singlet scalar as dark matter candidate, which
is assumed to be absolutely stable in ﬂat spacetime due to a discrete Z2 symmetry, but which may
decay in curved spacetimes due to a Z2-breaking non-minimal coupling to gravity. We calculate the
dark matter decay widths and we set conservative limits on the non-minimal coupling parameter
from experiments. The limits are very stringent and suggest that there must exist an additional
mechanism protecting the singlet scalar from decaying via this gravity portal.

INTRODUCTION

Multiple astronomical and cosmological observations
have by now demonstrated the existence of dark mat-
ter (DM), a non-luminous matter component in our Uni-
verse possibly constituted by a population of new parti-
cles not contained in the Standard Model (SM) of Particle
Physics, which were produced in the very ﬁrst stages of
our Universe by an as yet unidentiﬁed mechanism (for a
review, see [1]). Within this framework the DM parti-
cle(s) are required to have a lifetime at least as large as
the age of the Universe. Furthermore, if the DM particle
decays producing photons, neutrinos or antimatter, the
non-detection of excesses in the cosmic ﬂuxes of these
particles with respect to the expected backgrounds im-
plies a DM lifetime orders of magnitude larger than the
age of the Universe (for a review, see [2]).

A simple possibility to ensure a suﬃciently long life-
time consists in postulating a very light DM particle, such
that the decay rate becomes naturally suppressed by the
small phase space available. However, in many well mo-
tivated scenarios, notably those where the DM density
is generated via thermal freeze-out, the DM particle is
much heavier and a new symmetry, either global or lo-
cal, must be introduced in order to ensure DM stability.

This argument is usually formulated in ﬂat space-
time. However, since the only current evidence for DM is
through its gravitational eﬀects, it seems natural to em-
bed the DM framework in curved spacetime. This exten-
sion might lead to qualitative diﬀerences in the DM phe-
nomenology.
In particular, whereas gauge symmetries
are expected to be exact even in curved backgrounds,
this might not be the case for global symmetries. As a
result, and unless the DM particle is protected against
decay by a local symmetry, the Lagrangian may contain

eﬀective operators, suppressed by powers of the Planck
mass, inducing DM decay into SM particles with a long,
albeit potentially measurable, lifetime.

In this paper we will investigate the possibility that
the DM particle could decay via non-minimal coupling
to gravity. We will assume that the DM is stable in ﬂat
spacetime due to a global symmetry, which is explicitly
broken by gravitational interactions through a term pro-
portional to the Ricci scalar, such that the global sym-
metry gets restored in the limit of ﬂat spacetime. We will
show that this “gravity portal” leads to DM decay, even
if the DM does not have interactions with the SM, save
for gravity. As an illustration, we will focus on the singlet
scalar DM model, which is stabilized in ﬂat spacetime by
a global Z2 symmetry, and we will explicitly calculate
the decay channels and widths induced by a Z2-breaking
non-minimal coupling term to gravity.

In this work we will assume that the DM particle is
stable in ﬂat spacetime but can decay through operators
linear in the dark matter ﬁeld containing the Ricci scalar,
which are in general expected unless forbidden by a gauge
symmetry. The lowest-dimensional operator of this class
is linear in R and can be generically written as

Lξ = −ξRF (ϕ, X) ,

(4)

with ξ a dimensionless coupling parameter and F (ϕ, X)
a real function of the DM ﬁeld ϕ (and potentially other
ﬁelds X), invariant under the Lorentz and SM gauge sym-
metries. Adding this non-minimal coupling term, the ac-
tion reads

The concrete decay channels and rates depend on the
nature of the DM particle. Nevertheless, from Eq. (9)
one can already identify some general features of DM
decay through non-minimal coupling to gravity. First,
the decay widths are suppressed by powers of the Planck
mass and are proportional to the non-minimal coupling
parameter ξ squared. As a result, the decay branching
rations will only depend on the DM mass. Second, since
the gauge kinetic term remains invariant under the Weyl
transformation, there is no fundamental coupling of the
DM particle to diphotons or digluons. A coupling to the
Z and the W boson pairs is, however, induced through
the kinetic term of the Higgs boson. Third, in the ab-
sence of a cosmological constant term, there is no term
in the Lagrangian inducing DM decay into gravitons at
tree level.

In the remainder of the letter we will investigate in
detail the gravitationally induced decays in the scalar
singlet DM model and we will discuss the observational
constraints on the non-minimal coupling parameter ξ.

SCALAR SINGLET DARK MATTER

Consider a real scalar ﬁeld φ, singlet under the SM
gauge group and charged under a discrete Z2 symme-
try [3, 4]. The part of the Lagrangian involving the DM
particle reads, in the Jordan frame,

LDM =

1
2

gµν∂µφ∂νφ − V (φ, H) ,

(10)

where the interaction terms in the potential are assumed
to be invariant under the transformation φ → −φ. We
assume that the Z2 symmetry that ensures the stability
of the DM holds in ﬂat spacetime, but may be broken
in curved spacetimes, leading to DM decay. The lowest-
order Z2-breaking term is

Lξ = −ξM Rφ ,

(11)

,

where M is a mass parameter introduced so that ξ is
dimensionless. For this interaction term, the Weyl factor
deﬁned in Eq. (6) reads Ω2(φ) = 1 + 2κ2ξM φ. Using

Eq. (9) and expanding (cid:101)LSM to ﬁrst order in φ we obtain
(cid:101)LSM ⊃ −2κ2ξM φ

(cid:35)

Eq. (5) is written in the so-called Jordan frame, where
the DM ﬁeld is explicitly coupled to the curvature oper-
ator. Both quantities can be decoupled by performing a
Weyl transformation on the metric tensor:

(cid:101)gµν = Ω2(ϕ, X)gµν ,

where tilded quantities refer to the transformed met-

grangian reads:

2 Strictly, the ﬁeld φ is not canonically normalized. However, the
correction to the kinetic term due to non-minimal coupling is
of order ξ2 and therefore can be neglected when calculating the
rate at the lowest order in ξ.

TABLE I: Tree level decay channels of the scalar singlet DM
candidate induced by the non-minimal coupling to gravity,
together with the parametric dependence of the decay rate
on the DM mass and the SM mass scales.

DM interaction terms with the Standard Model particles
are absent. Besides, the higher dimensional operators in
Eq. (12) do not arise from integrating out heavy particles,
as necessarily occurs in ﬂat spacetime, but arise as a mere
consequence of the non-minimal coupling to gravity when
formulating the theory in the Einstein frame.

The diﬀerent tree level DM decay channels are listed
in table I, together with the dependence of the corre-
sponding decay rates on the DM and SM masses. From
Eq. (12) it follows that all decay rates are suppressed
by a common factor ξ2M 2/ ¯M 4
P . Hence, on dimensional
grounds, the decay rate must contain an additional factor
with dimensions of mass to the third power. The precise
form of this factor is listed for each channel in the right
column of table I.

For DM masses below the electroweak scale, the dom-
is expected to be φ → q ¯qg (or
inant decay channel
φ → f ¯f γ when the hadronic decays are kinematically
forbidden), due to the helicity suppression of the rate
for φ → f ¯f . On the other hand, for very large DM
masses the four-body decays φ → W W hh, ZZhh are ex-
pected to dominate, due to the enhancement in the rate
by a factor m4
φ/v4. Lastly, for intermediate masses the
three-body decays φ → f ¯f(cid:48)W, f ¯f Z are expected to dom-
inate, except in the rather small window v (cid:46) mφ (cid:46) 4πv,
where two-body decays with high thresholds, namely
φ → W W, ZZ, hh, t¯t have rates of comparable size
to the phase-space suppressed three-body channels.
The exact values of the branching ratios are shown in
Fig. 1; the decay processes φ → f ¯f γ, φ → 3h, φ → 4h,
φ → f ¯f h and φ → W W h, ZZh have branching ratios
below 5% and are not shown in the Figure. As antici-
pated above, the dominant decay modes are φ → q ¯qg for
mφ ∼ 1− 200 GeV, φ → W W, ZZ, hh, t¯t, q ¯qg for mφ ∼
200 GeV− 1 TeV, φ → f ¯f(cid:48)W, f ¯f Z for mφ ∼ 1− 100 TeV
and φ → W W hh, ZZhh for mφ (cid:38) 100 TeV. Details
about the calculation will be presented in a forthcoming
publication [5].

longer than the age of the universe and, more impor-
tantly, the non-observation of the gamma-rays, antimat-
ter particles and neutrinos produced in the decay over
the expected astrophysical backgrounds, sets strong lim-
its on the non-minimal coupling ξ. For the two-body de-
cay channels φ → W W, ZZ, hh, f ¯f detailed studies exist.
In particular, limits on the partial width into W W have
been derived in [6] employing the extragalactic gamma-
ray ﬂux extracted from the Fermi-LAT data [7], and read
(cid:38) 1027 s for mφ ∼ 0.2 TeV − 30 TeV. Com-
Γ−1
plementary limits have been obtained using the AMS-
02 positron data [8] and antiproton data [9].
In the
mφ ∼ 0.2 TeV − 30 TeV mass range, the limits on the
decay width from neutrino data are weaker [10]. How-
ever, for heavier DM particles, neutrino experiments pro-
vide the most stringent bounds on the (inverse) decay
width: for decay channels producing hard neutrinos, the
limit on the inverse width is Γ−1 (cid:38) 1026 − 1027 s for
mφ ∼ 10 TeV − 1015 GeV [11].

W W

A dedicated analysis of the gravitationally induced
three- and four-body decays in the scalar singlet DM
scenario is beyond the scope of this work.
In view of
the bounds resulting from neutrino experiments, we will
impose the conservative lower limit Γ−1 (cid:38) 1024 s over the
whole mass range for all the decay channels.

We show in Fig. 2 the inverse total decay width of
the scalar singlet DM for non-minimal coupling param-
eters ξ = 1, 10−8 and 10−16, assuming M = ¯MP .
We also show for comparison the age of the Universe,
τU ≈ 4×1017 s, and the conservative lower limit on the in-
verse decay width from neutrino telescopes Γ−1 (cid:38) 1024 s.
As apparent from the plot, non-minimal coupling param-
eters O(1) lead to a DM lifetime which is orders of mag-
nitude shorter than the age of the Universe. Further-
more, the non-observation in experiments of the neutri-
nos produced in the decay require ξ (cid:46) 10−8 (10−16) for
mφ ∼ 100 GeV (3 × 105 GeV).

matter ﬁeld and in the Ricci scalar, and is in general
present in the Lagrangian, unless forbidden by a gauge
symmetry. The decay rates through this “gravity portal”
are suppressed by powers of the Planck mass and are pro-
portional to the square of the non-minimal coupling pa-
rameter. Notably, the rates are non-vanishing even if the
dark matter only has gravitational interactions. Further-
more, the decay branching ratios into Standard Model
particles depend only on one free parameter, the dark
matter mass, rendering a fairly predictive framework.

We have illustrated dark matter decays via this “grav-
ity portal” in a simple scenario, where the dark matter
particle is a scalar singlet which is stabilized in ﬂat space-
time by a Z2 symmetry. We have assumed that the non-
minimal coupling to gravity breaks the Z2 symmetry and
we have identiﬁed the dominant decay channels. Finally,
we have calculated a constraint on the non-minimal cou-
pling parameter from the non-observation in experiments
of an excess in the cosmic neutrino ﬂuxes. The limits are
very stringent and strongly indicate that an additional
stabilization mechanism must be at work in the scalar
singlet dark matter scenario, possibly based on local in-
variance, in order to ensure a suﬃciently long-lived dark
matter particle.
