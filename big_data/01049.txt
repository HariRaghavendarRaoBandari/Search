Abstract

The treatment of the number-theoretical problem of integer par-
titions within the approach of statistical mechanics is discussed. His-
torical overview is given and known asymptotic results for linear and
plane partitions are reproduced. From numerical analysis of restricted
plane partitions an asymptotic formula is conjectured for an interme-
diate number of parts.

Key words: integer partitions, plane partitions, bosonic systems.

Introduction

The problem of integer partitions has quite a long story. For the ﬁrst time
it appeared, most evidently, in a letter of Leibniz to Jacob Bernoulli from
1674 [21]. Several decades later, Leonhard Euler signiﬁcantly contributed to
study of this problem [13, 14], having been initially drawn into the problem
by Philipp Naud´e.

A partition of a positive integer n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive
integers (called parts), where the order of the summands is not signiﬁcant
[1], possibly subject to one or more additional constraints. The number of

1

partitions is denoted p(n) and is called partition function in number theory,
but we will preserve this term to the Zustandssumme in statistical physics.
Consider partitions for ﬁrst several integers. For the sake of convenience
and compatibility with further deﬁnitions, the parts are written in a non-
increasing order:

1 :
2 :
3 :
4 :
5 :

1,
2 = 1 + 1,
3 = 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1,
4 = 3 + 1 = 2 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1,
5 = 4 + 1 = 3 + 2 = 3 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.

So, p(1) = 1, p(2) = 2, p(3) = 3, p(4) = 5, p(5) = 7.
In fact, p(n) is a
rapidly growing function: p(10) = 42, p(100) = 190 569 292, and p(200) =
3 972 999 029 388 [18, p. 836].

The partitions described above can be called simple, one-dimensional,
or linear. In 1917, Hardy and Ramanujan [19, 20] reported an asymptotic
estimation for the number of integer partitions at large n in the form:

(cid:40)

(cid:41)

(cid:114)2n

3

p(n) =

√
1
3 n
4

exp

π

,

(1)

Hardy and Ramanujan also obtained an asymptotic expansion for the p(n)
function. Two decades later, Rademacher provided a convergent series for
p(n) [26].

The so-called two-dimensional or plane partition of a positive integer
number n is a two-dimensional array of nonnegative integers nij subject to a
nonincreasing condition across rows and columns, such that [1]

n =

nij,

where ni1j1 ≥ ni2j2 whenever

i1 ≤ i2, j1 ≤ j2.

(2)

(cid:88)

i,j>0

For instance, the two-dimensional partitions of 3 are:

3,

2 1,

1

,

1 1 1,

The number of diﬀerent plane partitions of n is further denoted as p2D(n);
in the above examples p2D(3) = 6 and p2D(4) = 13.

Signiﬁcant contributions to the study of plane partitions were made by
MacMahon [22, 23]. The estimation for the asymptotic behavior of the num-
ber of plane partitions was given in 1931 by Wright as follows [35]:

p2D(n) =

[2ζ(3)]7/36

n−25/36 exp

[2ζ(3)]1/3 n2/3 + ζ(cid:48)(−1)

(cid:27)

Integer partitions discussed so far are called unrestricted. However, parts
of a partition can be subject to various constraints: one may require them
to be odd/even, limit the range of values, etc. The variety of constraints for
plane partitions is even richer and can concern their shape with respect to
rows and columns. The simplest condition is to limit the number of parts,
and such restricted partitions with the number of parts not exceeding N will
be denoted further as pN (n) for linear and p2D

N (n) for plane partitions.

Asymptotic estimation for the number of the restricted linear partitions

was ﬁrst obtained by Erd˝os and Lehner [12] as follows:

A similar result for restricted plane partitions seems not to ﬁnd a proper
reﬂection in the literature. The relevant asymptotic formulas obtained by
the present author [30] are discussed in Sec. 4.

2 Physical analogy and method description

The connection between a physical problem and integer partitions was ﬁrst
noted by Bohr and Kalckar in 1937 [5] with respect to the calculation of
the density of energy levels in heavy nuclei. In the same year, Van Lier and
Uhlenbeck noted the links between counting microstates of the systems obey-
ing Bose or Fermi statistics and some integer partition problems [34]. Quite

3

comprehensive bibliography on the relation between physical problems and
integer partitions can be found at http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/
staff/mrwatkin//zeta/partitioning.htm. For a short review, see also
[9].

Studies of integer partitions utilizing the approach of statistical mechanics
with respect to ensembles of quantum particles were made by Auluck and
Kothari [3], Temperley [32], Nanda [24], Dutta [10, 11], and many others. In
recent decades, the ﬂuctuations in quantum ensembles and ﬁnite-size eﬀects
were in the focus [7, 27, 28, 33], see also a series of papers by Grossmann
and Holthaus [15, 16, 17]. Plane partitions are linked to problems in theory
of crystals, random walks on lattices, various problems of statistical physics,
etc. [4].

The approach presented below is mostly based on [33]. The underlying
idea of the analogy between counting the number of partitions and number
of microstates of a quantum system of bosonic harmonic oscillators is quite
transparent. Consider for simplicity the ﬁrst nontrivial example of partitions
of n = 3:

3,

2 + 1,

1 + 1 + 1.

So, as it was mentioned in the Introduction, p(3) = 3.

Consider then the system of one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscilla-
tors with frequency ω obeying the Bose statistics. Let us count the number
of ways to distribute the energy of E = 3ω in this system. Each oscillator
can occupy energy levels given by εj = ω(j + 1/2), where the ground-state
energy can be dropped oﬀ yielding

εj = ωj,

j = 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . .
The possible ways to achieve the energy E = 3ω are:
• to put one particle into excited state with j = 3;
• to put one particle to the state with j = 2 and another one into the

(5)

j = 1 state. Note that quantum particles are indistinguishable!

• to put any three particles into the state j = 1 each.

All the remaining particles remain in the ground state j = 0. The possibility
for several particles to occupy a single energy level is ensured by the Bose
statistics. For illustration, see Fig. 1.

4

Figure 1: All possible realization of the state with energy E = 3ω in the
system of harmonic oscillators.

Therefore, the property that the order of summands is not signiﬁcant in
partitions is equivalent to the indistinguishability of quantum particles. The
number of identical parts can reach any value as with the occupation of a
quantum state in the Bose statistics. Moreover, it is obvious that unrestricted
partitions correspond to a system with an inﬁnite number of bosons and
restricted partitions (meaning, with a restricted number of parts) correspond
to a system with a ﬁnite number of bosons.

Some other types of partitions also can be related to physical models. For
instance, the so called distinct partitions, where all the parts are diﬀerent,
correspond to fermionic systems. An example of such a partition is given by

5 :

5 = 4 + 1 = 3 + 2.

If all the parts are less or equal to some s, such partitions can be modeled
by a system obeying the Gentile statistics [28]. An example of such a partition
is shown below:

5 :

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1
= 3 + 1 + 1 

= 4 + 1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 3 + 2 
= 5

for s = 3.

One can also consider partitions into powers of integers, e.g.:

5 :

12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 22 + 12,

which correspond to a system of free bosons due to the free particle spectrum
εj ∝ j2. Other generalization in the problem of partitions are also possible.
The method to link the problem in statistical mechanics to its counter-
part in number theory is as follows. The partition function (Zustandssumme)
Z(β) is connected to the number of microstates Γ (E) by the Laplace trans-
form [8, 16, 33]:

Z(β) =

Z(β) eβE dβ,

(6)

(cid:90) ∞

0

Γ (E) e−βE dE,

Γ (E) =

1
2πi

5

(cid:90) +i∞

−i∞

where β = 1/T is the inverse temperature.

After some transformations, using the method of steepest descent, the

number of microstates is obtained as

(cid:112)2πS(cid:48)(cid:48)(β0)

eS(β0)

,

Γ (E) =

where the entropy is given by

S(β) = βE + ln Z(β)

and β0 is the stationary point, so that

S(cid:48)(β0) = 0.

(7)

(8)

(9)

From this expression, estimations for the number of diﬀerent types of
integer partitions can be obtained by considering partition functions of re-
spective physical systems and subsequently substituting the energy E with
an integer n:

E → n,

Γ (E) → p(n).

(10)

In the following sections, the technique described above is applied to linear
and plane partitions, both unrestricted and restricted.

3 Application to unrestricted partitions

3.1 One-dimensional case

For this problem we expect the asymptotic result of Hardy and Ramanujan.
In the case of one-dimensional harmonic oscillators obeying the Bose
statistics the partition function of a system with an inﬁnite number of par-
ticles reads

∞(cid:89)

j=1

Z(β) =

1

1 − e−βωj ,

(11)

For simplicity, let further the unit of energy and temperature ω = 1.

The entropy of such a system is thus

S(β) = βE + ln Z(β) = βE −

ln(cid:0)1 − e−βj(cid:1) .

∞(cid:88)

one obtains in the limit of β → 0 (which is relevant to the problem as we
expect an asymptotic expression for large values of energy E):

(14)

Note the appearance of the 1/24 fraction near energy: such a subtle correc-
tion is present in the formula for the number of partitions beyond the main
asymptotic [20, 26]. In the limit of large E or equivalently – large n – it can
be dropped.

Stationary point satisfying the condition S(cid:48)(β0) = 0 is

β0 =

π√
6E

.

So, with S(cid:48)(cid:48)(β0) =

Γ (E) =

which is precisely the result of Hardy and Ramanujan.

3.2 Two-dimensional case

For this problem, Wright’s result (3) can be expected.

The derivation of an asymptotic expression is similar to the one-dimensional

case with minor modiﬁcations. A system of two-dimensional isotropic har-

So,

Γ 2D(E) =

monic oscillators should be considered. Taking into account the j-fold de-
generacy of the jth energy level, we have for entropy

where ζ(x) is the Riemann zeta-function.

With S(cid:48)(cid:48)(β0) =

To recover the correct value of c, the asymptotic series in the Euler–

Maclaurin formula [2] must be summed:

where B2k are the Bernoulli numbers and R is the remainder term. For
convenience, terms corresponding to the values of the function f (x) and
its derivative at inﬁnity were dropped as they are zero in the case under
consideration.

To sum up an asymptotic series with terms having alternating signs it is
suﬃcient to stop at the term with the least absolute value (k = 4 in Table 1).
Thus, with up to B6 and B8 terms, the following values of the c constant are
obtained instead of −1/6:

c = ζ(cid:48)(−1) = −0.165421 . . . .

In fact, the exact value of c = ζ(cid:48)(−1) can be obtained within the model
of two-dimensional harmonic oscillators but a much more sophisticated ap-
proach should be utilized as shown by Nanda [24].

as follows [25]:

in comparison with the main asymptotic by Wright (21) only for small values
of n < 17. The relative error for n = 50 is +1.81% for the main asymptotic
and −2.72% for the correction given by (27), for n = 100 the respective errors
are +1.13% and −1.98%, for n = 1000 they are +0.24% and −0.54%, etc.
The domain of small n is illustrated in Fig. 3.

4 Restricted partitions

As it was mentioned in Sec. 2, integer partitions with a restricted number of
parts are equivalent to a ﬁnite system of bosonic harmonic oscillators. The
partition function ZN of such a system of N particles obeys the following
recurrence relation [6]:

Z0(x) ≡ 1,

(29)

4.1 Linear partitions with a restricted number of parts

A closed-form expression for ZN exists only in the one-dimensional case:

N(cid:89)

Z 1D

N (x) =

1

1 − xk .

(30)

ZN (x) = Z(x)yN (x),

(31)
N→∞ yN (x) = 1.

The partition function Z(x) of an inﬁnite system can be written as:

where the function yN (x) has an obvious limiting behavior lim
Thus, in the one-dimensional case,

Z 1D(x) =

1

1 − xk

and consequently,

N (x) =

Since the entropy of a ﬁnite system is SN = βE + ln ZN = βE + ln Z + ln yN ,

4.2 Plane partitions with a restricted number of parts

The two-dimensional problem can be treated using the Z-transform tech-
niques to solve the recurrence relation (28) for the partition function. This
approach was suggested in [30].

The expression for the partition function of a system of N isotropic 2D

oscillators can be written as:

ln Z 2D

k ln(1 − xk),

(37)

At N → ∞, this expression recovers MacMahon’s generation function for
plane partitions [22, 31]:

N (x) = − N(cid:88)

(39)

(cid:26)

with the stationary point β0 = [2ζ(3)/n]1/3.

The following asymptotic behavior can thus be conjectured for the num-

ber of restricted plane partitions [30]:

p2D
N (n) = p2D(n) exp

− N n1/3
[2ζ(3)]1/3 e−N [2ζ(3)/n]1/3

.

(40)

This formula gives the estimation of the number of plane partitions of n into
at most N parts, where 0.75n1/3 (cid:28) N < n (this condition is due to limiting
transitions in derivation procedures).
The above approach was tested for n ≤ 20 with N/n = 9/10 yielding
decreasing relative errors of < 5–10%. The conjectured expression (40) yet
awaits the numerical check in a wide range of the n and N values.

4.3 Numerical results for restricted plane partitions at

intermediate values of N ∼ n2/3

Numerical analysis of the recurrence relation (28) for ZN (x) in two dimen-
sions was made for n = 100÷10 000. The value of the argument was x = e−β0

13

with the stationary point corresponding to the two-dimensional case as above,
β0 = [2ζ(3)/n]1/3. Some computed values are presented in Table 2.

As one can notice, the values of ZN rapidly approach asymptotic results
corresponding to the limit of N → n. This signiﬁcantly complicates the
numerical analysis of the recurrence relation (28) in the case discussed in the
previous subsection.

Upon transferring these results to the problem of plane partitions, the
following relation was found to describe the data quite satisfactorily for in-
termediate values of N ∼ n2/3:

= −An2/3N−1/3 exp(cid:8)−kN 3/2/n + b n1/3 ln N(cid:9) .

Constants A, b, and k were calculated as ﬁtting parameters with the follow-
ing values: A = 1.075 ± 0.008, b = 0.0060 ± 0.0002, and k = 2.26 ± 0.2.
Interestingly, the computed value of k is close to k = 2ζ(3) = 2.40411 . . .
making the respective factor k/n = β3
0.

Therefore, the second asymptotic relation can be conjectured for the num-

ber of restricted plane partitions in the following form:

5 Final remarks

In summary, an overview of some problems in the theory of integer partitions
was given and relevant results obtained within the statistical mechanics ap-
proach were brieﬂy discussed. Known asymptotic expressions for unrestricted
linear and plane partitions were reproduced and the possibility to obtain the
correction to the leading asymptotic was demonstrated.

The asymptotic expression for the number of restricted linear partitions
into at most N parts was correctly reproduced as well. Asymptotic formulas
for the number of plane partitions into at most N parts were conjectured.
The asymptotic behavior of restricted plane partitions with N ∼ n2/3 was
estimated numerically. The conjectured formulas await testing for large n
and N .

Possible generalization for higher-order partitions can be derived within
the discussed approaches, with some preliminary analysis presented in [29].
Application to physical problems, especially to study quantum ensembles of
particles obeying diﬀerent types of statistics, is seen as one of the principal
directions relating integer partitions and statistical mechanics, which require
further exploration.
