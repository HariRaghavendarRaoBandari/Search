Abstract

Biomedical optical imaging has a possibility of a comprehensive diagnosis of thyroid cancer in
conjunction with ultrasound imaging. For improvement of the optical imaging, this study de-
velops a higher order scheme for solving the time-dependent radiative transport equation (RTE)
by use of the ﬁnite-diﬀerence and discrete-ordinate methods. The accuracy and eﬃciency of the
developed scheme are examined by comparison with the analytical solutions of the RTE in ho-
mogeneous media. Then, the developed scheme is applied to describing photon migration in the
human neck model. The numerical simulations show complex behaviors of photon migration in
the human neck model due to multiple diﬀusive reﬂection near the trachea.

Keywords: Biomedical optical imaging; Photon migration in biological tissue; Radiative
transport equation; Diﬀusion approximation.

1. Introduction

Thyroid cancer is one of common cancers, whose incidence increases in accordance with
developments of biomedical imaging modalities [1]. There are several kinds of thyroid cancers,
and most of them can be accurately diagnosed by using the ultrasound tomography and ﬁne
needle aspiration cytology to examine the cellular structures [2]. Nevertheless, diagnosis of
follicular thyroid carcinoma is still diﬃcult, because neither the ultrasound tomography nor the
needle aspiration cytology can diﬀerentiate between them. Hence, other imaging modality is
essential for comprehensive diagnosis of thyroid cancer.

Diﬀuse optical tomography (DOT) has a potential to accurately and non-invasively diagnose
whether the tumor is benign or malignant based on the diﬀerence in optical properties [3, 4]. The

optical properties (e.g. the absorption and scattering coeﬃcients, and anisotropic factor) char-
acterize the strength of absorption and scattering of light by a turbid medium such as biological
tissue. Unlike a conventional image reconstruction algorithm for X-ray computed tomography,
of which fundamentals are measuring line integrals of the attenuation coeﬃcients and solving
a set of integral equations for the attenuation coeﬃcients, DOT needs an inversion process to
reconstruct a distribution of tomographic image of the optical properties inside the tissues based
on a mathematical model describing the diﬀusive nature of photon migration in scattering media
[5]. Hence, for obtaining a high quality image of DOT, an accurate photon migration model is
essential, and an eﬃcient scheme for solving the model is required.

Mainly, two types of the governing equations for photon migration have been used: the radia-
tive transport equation (RTE) and the diﬀusion equation (DE). The RTE can accurately describe
photon migration in wide ranges of time-length scales, and numerical schemes for solving the
RTE have extensively been developed by using the ﬁnite-diﬀerence [6, 7], ﬁnite-element [8], and
ﬁnite-volume methods [9].

However, their computational loads for solving the RTE are heavy because the RTE is an
integro-diﬀerential equation with many independent variables. Due to this reason, the RTE has
usually been applied to small-sized media such as human ﬁngers and rats. Meanwhile, the DE can
be applied to large-sized media (e.g. the human brain) [10, 11, 12] because the approximation can
decrease the number of the independent variables to reduce the computational loads. However,
it is well understood the DE is valid in spatial and temporal regions after photons undergo a
suﬃcient number of scattering events. In non-scattering or void regions, the DE is invalid and
fails to describe photon migration [13, 14, 15].

The human neck is a large-sized and inhomogeneous medium consisting of the trachea, arter-
ies, veins, muscles, bones, adipose tissue, and so on. The trachea is a void region where photons
travel straight without being absorbed and scattered. Also, the arteries and veins are highly ab-
sorbing regions, where photons are totally absorbed before photons undergo a suﬃcient number
of scattering events for the DE to be valid. Considering the above-mentioned characteristics of
the human neck, an eﬃcient scheme for solving the RTE is still in need of further development.
This paper develops the numerical scheme for solving the RTE using the ﬁnite-diﬀerence and
discrete-ordinate methods (the 3rd order upwind and the 4th order Runge-Kutta methods). At
ﬁrst, the validity of the developed scheme is conﬁrmed for homogeneous media by comparison
with analytical solutions. After the validation, the developed scheme is applied to investigation
of photon migration in the human neck.

The following section provides an explanation of the numerical method based on the RTE.
Section 3 provides the numerical results for a 2D homogeneous square medium and an inhomo-
geneous medium modeled from an MR image of the human neck. Finally, conclusions are given
in section 4.

3.1. Radiative transport equation and numerical scheme

2D photon migration in turbid media such as biological tissues is accurately formulated by

the RTE [16],

where I(r, Ω, t) [W/cm rad] represents the intensity, which describes the photon energy ﬂow as a
function of position, r = (x, y) [cm], angular direction, Ω = (Ωx, Ωy) = (cos θ, sin θ) with angle,
θ [rad], and time, t [ps]. µa(r) [1/cm] and µs(r) [1/cm] are the absorption and scattering coeﬃ-
cients, respectively, v [cm/ps] is the velocity of light in the turbid medium, P(r, Ω · Ω′) [1/rad]
is the scattering phase function with Ω and Ω′ denoting the scattered and incident directions,
respectively, and q(r, Ω, t) [W/cm2 rad] is a source. In this study, P(r, Ω · Ω′) is given by the
Henyey-Greenstein function [17] in two dimensions [18],

P(r, Ω · Ω′) =

(2)

where g(r) represents the anisotropic factor deﬁned as the average cosine of P(r, Ω · Ω′). For
simplicity, q(r, Ω, t) is given by an isotropic delta function. The boundary condition under the
refractive-index mismatching is employed with the reﬂectivity, R(n, Ω · ˆen(rb)), calculated by the
Fresnel’s law and Snell’s law, where n denotes the refractive index of the medium and ˆen(rb)
denotes the outward normal vector at the boundary position, rb [7].

· · · , Nx}), y j = j∆y ( j ∈ {0,

In this study, the RTE is numerically solved based on the ﬁnite-diﬀerence and discrete-
ordinate methods. For numerical discretization, x, y, θ, and t are divided into xi = i∆x (i ∈
{0,
· · · , Nθ}), and tm = m∆t
(m ∈ {0, · · · , Nt}) with constant step sizes of ∆x, ∆y, ∆θ, and ∆t, respectively, and numbers of
grid nodes and timesteps, Nx, Ny, Nθ, and Nt, respectively. In the same manner, Ω is discretized
as (Ωkx, Ωky) = (cos θk, sin θk), and I(r, Ω, t) at the grid node and timestep is expressed as Im
i jk.

· · · , Ny}), θk = k∆θ (k ∈ {0,

For the ﬁnite-diﬀerence discrete-ordinate methods, previous papers mostly employ the 1st
order scheme: the 1st order upwind (1UW) scheme for r, the extended trapezoidal rule for Ω,
and the forward Euler method (FE) for t [19, 20]. The 1st order scheme is stable and accurate if
the spatial and temporal step sizes, ∆x and ∆t, are suﬃciently ﬁne, but the ﬁne step sizes result in
heavy computational loads. To reduce the computational loads, this study employs the 3rd order
upwind (3UW) scheme and 4th order Runge-Kutta (4RK) method.

In the 3UW, the advection term in the x-direction, Ωx∂I(r, Ω)/∂x, is discretized as

Ωx∂I(r, Ω)/∂x ∼ 

Ωkx ≥ 0

,

(3)

for the internal nodes. For the grids near the boundary, the 1UW scheme is employed. The
advection term in the y-direction, Ωy∂I(r, Ω)/∂y, is also discretized in the same manner as in the
x-direction. The 3UW is slightly unstable compared to the 1st order scheme, and oscillations
appear at early arriving times and at positions very close to the source. In this study, the media
is so large that the oscillations are negligibly small.

Based on the extended trapezoidal rule, the scattering integral is calculated as

where wk′ = 2π/Nθ is a weight and fk′ is a renormalizing factor. To satisfy the normalization of
dΩ′P = 1, fk′ is formulated with a slight modiﬁcation of the

the scattering phase function R2π
Liu’s renormalization [21], 1/ fk′ = PNθ

In the matrix notation, the discretized RTE except for the time variable, t, is given as an

algebraic equation,

where a matrix A represents the second, third, and fourth terms in the left-hand side of Eq. (1), a
matrix P represents the scattering integral (Eq. (4)) multiplied by µs(r), vectors I and Q are the
intensity and source, respectively.

Based on the 4RK, the temporal change in the intensity is calculated as

Im+1 ∼ Im +

(k1 + 2k2 + 2k3 + k4),

where kl(l = 1, 2, 3, 4) are given by the following equations,

k1 = v∆t(−A + P)Im,
k2 = v∆t(−A + P)(Im + 0.5k1),
k3 = v∆t(−A + P)(Im + 0.5k2),
k4 = v∆t(−A + P)(Im + k3).

(7)

Because the explicit method is used for 4RK, it should satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
(CFL) condition, ∆t ≤ ∆x/2v, for stable solutions [20, 22].

In this study, parallel programming is implemented with a 24 threads computer (Intel Xeon
X5690 @3.47GHz) by using OpenMP, which is a portable and shared-memory programming
scheme.

3.2. Geometry, optical properties, and step sizes in discretization

To construct the human neck model, the study uses an MR image of the human neck as shown
in Fig. 1 (a). Segmentation of the MR image is performed, and primary organs in the human
neck such as common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, trachea, spinal cord, and spine are
extracted as shown in Fig. 1 (b). Other organs such as human muscle, bone, and adipose tissue
are collected to form a homogeneous background. Then, irregular boundaries of the organs and
background in the image are mapped with regular grids for numerical calculations. At the surface
of the human neck, the Fresnel’s law is employed for the boundary condition which describes the
reﬂection and refraction at the boundary due to the diﬀerence in the refractive index between the
medium and surrounding air. Meanwhile, we assume that the refractive index inside the medium
is homogeneous. So neither reﬂection nor refraction takes places at the interfaces between dif-
ferent organs, and no boundary condition is used at the interfaces. The optical properties of
the organs and background tissues in the human neck in the near-infrared wavelength range are
listed in Table 1, referring to [23, 24], and the properties of the thyroid gland is considered to be
the same as those of the background. Strictly speaking, the arteries have diﬀerent values of the
properties from the veins, but it is simply assumed that the both have the same optical properties.
Except the trachea, the tissues are assumed to have a constant value of g = 0.9, corresponding to
highly forward-peaked scattering.

Appropriate values of the step sizes are dependent on the optical properties; ∆x and ∆t are
s = µs(1 − g) and µa, and ∆θ should be smaller when g approaches to

inversely proportional to µ′
one. In each case, we set the appropriate values of the step sizes.

4. Numerical results

4.1. Validation of the developed numerical scheme

Before a discussion on the results of photon migration in the human neck model, the devel-
oped numerical scheme is validated for the case of a homogeneous 2D square medium with a
side of 4.0 cm by comparison with analytical solutions for inﬁnite media. When the source is
located inside the medium far from the boundary, the numerical solutions of the intensities at
the positions far from the boundary are less inﬂuenced by the boundary. Then, the comparisons
of the numerical solutions for ﬁnite media with the analytical solutions for inﬁnite media are
reasonable. In this subsection, an isotropic impulse point source is incident at (x, y) = (1.5 cm,
2.0 cm), and the intensities at (2.5 cm, 2.0 cm) are calculated.

At ﬁrst, the case of isotropic scattering (g = 0.0) is examined because the exact analytical

solution of the RTE has been given by Paasschens [25] as follows,

e−µtvtΘ(vt − ρ),

ΦER(ρ, t) = v

where Φ is the ﬂuence rate deﬁned asR2π

dΩI, Θ is the Heaviside step function, µt = µa + µs, and
ρ is the distance from the source. Also, the analytical solution of the DE [26], ΦDE, is given as,

where the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D is given as [2(1 − g)µs]−1 for the 2D time-dependent case
[27, 28]. The absorption and scattering coeﬃcients are given as the same as those of either (a)
the background: µa = 0.30 cm−1 and µs = 80.0 cm−1, or (b) the artery: µa = 4.76 cm−1 and

ρ = 1.0 cm: pluses and circles represent the numerical solution based on the 1UW+FE, and the 3UW+4RK, respectively,
and red and blue solid curves the analytical solutions, ΦER and ΦDE, respectively. The optical properties are given as (a)
µa = 0.30 cm−1, µs = 80.0 cm−1, and g = 0.0 and (b) µa = 4.76 cm−1, µs = 67.5 cm−1, and g = 0.0.

s = 67.5 cm−1 as listed in Table 1. The former and latter cases correspond to weakly and
µ′
strongly absorbing media, respectively. The step sizes are given as (a) ∆x = ∆y = 0.02 cm,
∆θ = 0.13 rad, and ∆t = 0.3 ps, and (b) ∆x = ∆y = 0.005 cm, ∆θ = 0.13 rad, and ∆t = 0.07 ps,
respectively.

Figure 2 shows the time-resolved proﬁles of Φ calculated numerically and analytically at
ρ = 1.0 cm. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the numerical solution of the RTE based on the 3UW+4RK
agrees very well with the analytical solutions in the case of the weakly absorbing medium. Mean-
while, the numerical solution based on the 1UW+FE deviates from the analytical solutions. This
result indicates that in the case of the 1st order scheme, the current values of ∆x and ∆t are inap-
propriate, and smaller values of them are necessary to obtain good agreement with the analytical
solutions. Note that ΦDE is in good agreement with ΦER and the numerical solution based on the
higher order scheme. This is because ρ is suﬃciently long for the DE to hold.

The results of the case of the strongly absorbing medium are shown in Fig. 2 (b), where Φ
has sharp peaks at earlier times than in Fig. 2 (a) due to stronger absorption. Similarly to the case
of the weakly absorbing medium (Fig. 2 (a)), the numerical solution based on the 3UW+4RK
agrees very well with ΦER, meanwhile the solution based on the 1UW+FE deviates from ΦER. It
is seen that the curve of ΦDE has a similar shape to that of ΦER even for the strongly absorbing
medium, although the peak time and width of the curve of ΦDE are slightly diﬀerent from those
of ΦER.

t = µ′

s = µs(1 − g) and µ′

In the case of anisotropic scattering media (g , 0), a derivation of exact analytical solutions
of the RTE is still a diﬃcult problem even in inﬁnite homogeneous media. In this study, an
approximate RTE solution, ΦAR, proposed by Martelli [29] is used to be compared with the
numerical solutions. The basic assumption for ΦAR is that µs and µt in Eq. (8) can be replaced
by µ′
s + µa, respectively. Again, two sets of the optical properties of the
medium are considered: (a) µa = 0.30 cm−1, µs = 80.0 cm−1, and g = 0.9 of the background,
and (b) µa = 4.76 cm−1, µs = 675 cm−1, and g = 0.9 of the artery. Other conditions are the
same as those in the case with the isotropic scattering media. As shown in Fig. 3 (a) in the case
of the weak absorption, the numerical solution of the RTE based on the 3UW+4RK agree well
with ΦAR. However, in details, a small diﬀerence between them is seen during the period from
about 100 ps to 400 ps. Even if the step sizes are ﬁner, the numerical solution is found to be
unchanged. Thus, this small diﬀerence could be the error in ΦAR due to the approximation. In

of the RTE, ΦAR. (a) µa = 0.30 cm−1, µs = 80.0 cm−1, and g = 0.9 and (b) µa = 4.76 cm−1, µs = 675 cm−1, and
g = 0.9. Other details are the same as in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3 (a), the deviations of the numerical solution based on the 1UW+FE are small compared
with that in the case of isotropic scattering. Because the appropriate value of ∆x is inversely
s = 8.0 cm−1 than in
proportional to µ′
s = 80 cm−1. This is the reason why the 1UW+FE performs
the isotropic scattering case with µ′
better in the anisotropic scattering case.

s, it is much larger in the anisotropic scattering case with µ′

Figure 3 (a) shows that ΦDE is in agreement with the approximate RTE solution at the peak
time (t ∼100 ps) and the decay period (t > 100 ps). At early arriving time (t < 100 ps),
meanwhile, ΦDE deviates from the approximate RTE solution. This deviation comes from the
diﬀerence in the speed of light between the RTE and the DE. In the RTE, the speed of light is
given as v, while in the DE it is inﬁnite [22].

The strongly absorbing and anisotropic scattering case is shown in Fig. 3 (b). The curves of
Φ in the case of anisotropic scattering are the same as those in the case of isotropic scattering
(Fig. 2 (b)). This is maybe because the curves are mostly determined by µ′
s, and the values of µ′
s
are the same for the two cases.

From the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the developed schemes is validated.

4.2. Photon migration in the human neck model

The developed numerical scheme of the 3UW+4RK is used to describe photon migration in
the human neck model shown in Fig. 1 (b). Figure 4 shows the snapshots of Φ-distributions at
ﬁxed times in the human neck model, where light is incident on the front surface of the human
neck at the position of (x, y) = (3.5 cm, 6.3 cm).

As listed in Table 1, the trachea is a void region indicated by a white solid curve in each ﬁgure
of Fig. 4. Therefore, at the early time of 46.2 ps shown in Fig. 4 (a), photons propagate without
being scattered or absorbed inside the trachea. At the time of 79.9 ps shown in Fig. 4 (b), the
photons reach the trachea boundary far from the source position, and migrate diﬀusively in the
background tissue where they are scattered in all directions, and some portion of the scattered
photons return back to the trachea as the diﬀusive reﬂection. Then, the reﬂected photons travel
back to the trachea boundary near the source position as shown in Fig. 4 (c), repeat diﬀusive
reﬂections back and forth inside the trachea, and gradually migrate into the tissue outside the
trachea as diﬀusive propagation as shown in Fig. 4 (d) to (f). It looks as if the void region of the
trachea acts as a light source.

Figure 4: Spatial distributions of Φ calculated from the RTE in the human neck model (Fig. 1 (b)) at ﬁxed times. Unit of
the color bar is [W/cm]. The light source is represented by a red arrow in (a), and the boundary of the trachea is denoted
by a white solid curve in each ﬁgure.

Note that the magnitudes of Φ indicated by the color bars rapidly decay as time goes and
photons migrate into the tissue. Also note that photons are absorbed especially by veins and
arteries having large µa which appear as dark blue spots in all of Fig. 4 (a) to (f). Thus, few
photons reach the backside of the human neck.
In fact, it is conﬁrmed that at the backside
position, (x, y) = (3.5 cm, 0.0 cm), the magnitude of Φ is kept at less than 10−10 during the time
period from 0 ps to 800 ps.

These results suggest that near the light source, the accurate scheme for solving the RTE is
necessary, while far from the light source, the approximate and eﬃcient scheme is good enough
to describe photon migration in the human neck model.

5. Conclusions

To describe photon migration in the human neck, we have developed the accurate and eﬃcient
numerical scheme to solve the RTE based on the 3rd order upwind and 4th order Runge-Kutta
methods for the purpose of comprehensive diagnose of thyroid cancer by optical imaging. We
have conﬁrmed the validity of the developed scheme by comparison with the analytical solutions
in homogeneous media. Numerical simulations of photon migration in the human neck model
have shown a complicated pattern of photon migration, arising from multiple diﬀusive reﬂection
near the trachea.
