Abstract. We consider ecological diﬀerence equations of the form X i
where X i
t is a vector of densities corresponding to the subpopulations of species
subpopulations of diﬀerent ages or living in diﬀerent patches), Xt =
i (e.g.
(X 1
t ) is state of the entire community, and Ai(Xt) are matrices de-
termining the update rule for species i. These equations are permanent if they
are dissipative and the extinction set {X : Qi kX ik = 0} is repelling.
If per-
manence persists under perturbations of the matrices Ai(X), the equations are
robustly permanent. We provide suﬃcient and necessary conditions for robust
permanence in terms of Lyapunov exponents for invariant measures supported
by the extinction set. Applications to ecological and epidemiological models are
given.

1. Introduction

A fundamental question in ecology is to understand under what minimal condi-
tions a community of species persist in the long run. Historically, theoretical ecolo-
gists characterize persistence by the existence of an asymptotic equilibrium in which
the proportion of each population is strictly positive [May, 1975, Roughgarden,
1979]. More recently, coexistence was equated with the existence of an attractor
bounded away from extinction [Hastings, 1988], a deﬁnition that ensures popu-
lations will persist despite small, random environmental perturbations [Schreiber,
2006, 2007]. However, “environmental perturbations are often vigourous shake-ups,
rather than gentle stirrings” [Jansen and Sigmund, 1998]. To account for large, but
rare, perturbations, the concept of permanence, or uniform persistence, was intro-
duced in late 1970s [Freedman and Waltman, 1977, Schuster et al., 1979]. Uniform
persistence requires that asymptotically species densities remain uniformly bounded
away from extinction. In addition, permanence requires that the system is dissipa-
tive i.e. asymptotically species densities remain uniformly bounded from above.

Various mathematical approaches exist for verifying permanence [Hutson and Schmitt,

1992, Smith and Thieme, 2011] including topological characterizations with respect
to chain recurrence [Butler and Waltman, 1986, Hofbauer and So, 1989], average
Lyapunov functions [Hofbauer, 1981, Hutson, 1984, Garay and Hofbauer, 2003], and
measure theoretic approaches [Schreiber, 2000, Hofbauer and Schreiber, 2010]. The
latter two approaches involve the long-term per-capita growth rates of species when
rare. For continuous-time, unstructured models of the form

(1)

dxi

= fi(x)xi, i = 1, ..., m,

where x = (x1, . . . , xm) is the vector of population densities, the long-term growth
rate of species i with initial community state x equals

where xs denotes the solution of (1) with initial condition x0 = x. Hofbauer [1981]
showed, under appropriate assumptions, that the system is permanent provided

Condition C: there exist positive weights p1, . . . , pm associated with each species

such thatPi piri(x) > 0 for any initial condition x with one or more missing
species (i.e. Qi xi = 0).

Intuitively, the community persists if on average the community increases when rare.
Any sensible deﬁnition that characterizes the long-term behavior of a population
dynamics should be robust under small perturbation of the governing equations.
This concept is practical from a modeling standpoint as most population dynamics
models ignore weak interactions between populations. For instance, the modeler
assumes that fi is independent of xj where j 6= i when in fact there is a weak de-
pendence on xj. Hence it is desirable to know whether “nearby” models that include
these interactions as well as the original model are permanent. To address this need,
the model (1) is robust permanent if it is permanent under small perturbations of the
maps fi (see [Hofbauer and Sigmund, 1998, Hutson and Schmitt, 1992]). Schreiber
[2000] and Garay and Hofbauer [2003] consider the average long-term growth rates
of species i

ri(µ) =Z ri(x)dµ

with respect to an ergodic measure µ, and showed that the system (1) is robust
permanent provided

Condition C′: there exist positive weights p1, . . . , pn associated with each species

such thatPi piri(µ) > 0 for any ergodic measure µ supported by the bound-

ary of the non-negative cone Rn
+.

In fact, conditions C and C′ are equivalent. Moreover, it is suﬃcient to check C′ for
each component of a Morse decomposition on the boundary (see Section 3.2). While
Garay and Hofbauer [2003] extended these results to discrete-time, unstructured
models of the form xi
t, their results are restricted to homeomorphisms
which excludes many classical models from population biology (e.g. see Section 5).
As populations often exhibit structure (e.g., individuals living in diﬀerent spatial
locations, individuals being of diﬀerent ages or in diﬀerent stages of development),
Hofbauer and Schreiber [2010] obtained robust permanence results for systems of
the form

t+1 = fi(xt)xi

(2)

dxi
dt

= Ai(x)xi, i = 1, ..., m,

where xi= (xi1, xi2, . . . , xini)T ∈ Rni is the transpose of the row vector of populations
abundances of individuals in diﬀerent states for population i, x = (x1, ..., xm), Ai(x)
are non-negative matrices, and n1 + ... + nm = n. For these models, the average
long-term growth rates with respect to an ergodic measure µ are given by

ri(µ) =Z hAi(x)ui(x), ui(x)i µ(dx)

where h·,·i represents the inner product and where, care of a result of Ruelle [1979],
ui(x) spans a one dimensional vector space that is invariant under the linear trans-
formation represented by the fundamental solution matrix for dy
dt = Ai(xt)y with
x0 = x. With this notion of the long-term growth rate, the necessary condition C′
for robust permanence extends to these structured models.

ROBUST PERMANENCE FOR ECOLOGICAL MAPS

In this paper, we extend conditions (C) and (C′) to the discrete-time analogous

of (2) of the form

X i

t+1 = X i

t Ai(Xt), i = 1, ..., m,

(3)
where X i ∈ Rni is the row vector of populations abundances of individuals in dif-
ferent states for population i at time t ∈ N, and Xt = (X 1
t ). Then the long
term growth rate ri(x) of species i corresponds to the dominant Lyapunov exponent
associated with the matrix products along the population trajectory:

t , ..., X m

ri(x) = lim sup

t→∞

1
t

ln||Ai(X0) · . . . · Ai(Xt−1)||, X0 = x,

and the average long-term growth rate with respect to an ergodic measure µ is

ri(µ) =Z ri(x) µ(dx).

This extension to discrete time is non-trivial as the semiﬂow generated by a discrete
dynamical system is not necessarily a homeomorphism, a key ingredient used in the
proofs for the continuous-time cases.

Our main result implies that the “community increases when rare” criterion for
robust permanence also applies for the system (3). More precisely, we show that
conditions (C) and (C′) are equivalent and imply robust permanence of the system
(3). This result extends (in the case when ni = 1 for all i = 1, ..., m) the results in
Garay and Hofbauer [2003] from homeomorphisms to non-invertible maps and the
result in Hofbauer and Schreiber [2010] from continuous-time models to discrete-
time models. Our model, assumptions, and deﬁnitions of permanence and robust
permanence are presented in Section 2. Long-term growth rates for these models and
our main theorem are stated in Section 3. A reﬁnement of our result involving Morse
decompositions of boundary dynamics is also presented in Section 3. Proofs of most
results are presented in Section 4. We apply our results to a series of models from
population biology in Section 5. We obtain, for the ﬁrst time, robust permanence
results for the discrete-time Lotka-Volterra equations introduced by Hofbauer et al.
[1987]. For spatially structured versions of these Lotka-Voltera models, we provide,
using a perturbation result, a simple condition for robust permanence. Notably, our
condition holds despite the dynamics of each competitor potentially being chaotic.
Finally, we obtain a robust permanence condition for a classical epidemiological SIR
model.

2. Model and assumptions

We study the dynamics of m interacting populations in a constant environment.

To deﬁne the population dynamics, we consider projection matrices for each pop-
ulation that depend on the population state. More precisely, given X the population
state, for each i, let Ai(X) be a non-negative, ni × ni matrix whose j–k-th entry
corresponds to the contribution of individuals in state j to individuals in state k e.g.
individuals transitioning from state j to state k or the mean number of oﬀspring

H2: For each population i, the matrix Ai has ﬁxed sign structure corresponding
to a primitive matrix. More precisely, for each i, there is a ni × ni, non-
negative, primitive matrix Pi such that the j-kth entry of Ai(X) equals zero
if and only if j-kth entry Pi equals zero for all 1 ≤ j, k ≤ ni and X ∈ Rn

δ-perturbations of model (5) are permanent with a common η > 0 value i.e. there is
a common/uniform region of repulsion around the boundary.

3. Results

3.1. Long-term growth rates and robustly unsaturated sets. Understanding
persistence often involves understanding what happens to each population when it
is rare. To this end, we need to understand the propensity of the population to
increase or decrease in the long term. Since

Population i is tending to show periods of increase when ri(x) > 0 and periods of
asymptotic decrease when ri(x) < 0.

An expected, yet useful property of ri(x) is that ri(x) ≤ 0 whenever kxik > 0. In
words, whenever population i is present, its per-capita growth rate in the long-term
is non-positive. This fact follows from H3. Furthermore, if lim supt→∞ kX i
tk > 0,
we get that ri(x) = 0. In words, if population i’s density inﬁnitely often is bounded
below by some minimal density, then its long-term growth rate is zero as it is not
tending to extinction and its densities are bounded from above. Both of these facts
are consequences of Propositions 4.10, 4.14 and 4.15.

A compact set M ⊂ SA is said to be invariant for ΦA if ΦA(M ) = M and is
isolated if there exists a compact neighborhood N , called an isolating neighborhood
of M , such that M is the largest invariant set in N . For suﬃciently small δ-
perturbations ΦAδ of ΦA, an isolating neighborhood N of M for ΦA is also an
isolating neighborhood for a compact invariant set M (δ) of ΦAδ . M (δ) is called the
continuation of M .

Deﬁnition 3.1. A compact set M ⊂ S0 is unsaturated for model (5) if M is isolated
in Rn
+ and W s(M ) ⊂ S0. If, in addition, the continuation of M corresponding to
suﬃciently small δ-perturbations of model (5) are unsaturated, we call M robustly
unsaturated.

With these deﬁnitions, we can state our main Theorem.

Theorem 3.2. Let M be a compact isolated set for the dynamics ΦA restricted to
S0. If one of the following equivalent conditions holds

(i) r∗(µ) := max1≤i≤m ri(µ) > 0 for every ΦA-invariant probability measure

with µ(M ) = 1, or

(ii) there exist positive constants p1, . . . , pm such that

piri(µ) > 0

Xi

for every ergodic probability measure with µ(M ) = 1, or

(iii) there exist positive constants p1, . . . , pm such that

piri(x) > 0

for all x ∈ M ,

then M is robustly unsaturated for model (5).

Remark 3.3. For some applications (e.g., the disease model considered in sec-
tion 5.3), it is useful to relax the primitivity assumption H2. For instance, if there
exists an open neighborhood U of M such that for each i, Ai(x) has a ﬁxed sign
pattern for all x ∈ U , then Ai(x) can be decomposed into a ﬁnite number, say
mi, of irreducible components. For each of these irreducible components, one can
deﬁne rj
i (Xt−1)k with X0 = x where
Aj
i (x) is the submatrix of Ai(x) corresponding to the j-th irreducible component
i (µ) and
of Ai(x).
ri(µ) = max1≤j≤mi rj

i (µ), then all of the assertions of Theorem 3.2 still hold.

We can prove a partial converse to Theorem 3.2. For any ergodic probability

measure µ, deﬁne species(µ) to be the unique subset of {1, 2, . . . , n} such that

µ({x : kxik > 0 if and only if i ∈ species(µ)}) = 1.

Proposition 3.4. Assume ΦA is twice continuously diﬀerentiable. Let M be a com-
pact isolated set for the dynamics ΦA restricted to S0. If µ is an ergodic, probability
measure with µ(M ) = 1 and

ri(µ) ≤ 0 for all i /∈ species(µ),

then M is not robustly unsaturated for (5). Speciﬁcally, for any δ > 0, there exists
a δ-perturbation Aδ of (5) and x ∈ SAδ \ S0 such that ωAδ(x) ⊂ M .
Proof. Choose δ > 0. Let U ⊂ Nδ/2(SA) be an open neighborhood of SA such that
U is forward invariant for (5). Let V ⊂ W be open neighborhoods of M such that

3.2. Morse decompositions and robust permanence. Here we state a suf-
ﬁcient condition for robust permanence using a characterization of permanence
due to Hofbauer and So [1989] that involves Morse decompositions of boundary
dynamics. As ΦA is not invertible, backward orbits of a point x need not be
unique. Consequently, a sequence {xs}−∞
s=0 is a backward orbit through x if x0 =
x and x−s+1 = ΦA(x−s) for all s ≥ 1. The α-limit set of a backward orbit
{xs}−∞
Following
Hofbauer and So [1989], we deﬁne a collection of sets {M1, . . . , Mk} to be a Morse
decomposition for a compact invariant set M if
• M1, . . . , Mk are pairwise disjoint, compact isolated sets for ΦA restricted to
• For each x ∈ M \ ∪k
i=1Mi, there is an i such that ω(x) ⊂ Mi and for any

limsk→−∞ xsk = y for some sk → −∞}.

s=0 is α({xs}) = {y :

backward orbit {xs} through x there is a j > i such that α({xs}) ⊂ Mj.
Hofbauer and So [1989] proved the following characterization of permanence.

M .

Theorem 3.5 (Hofbauer & So 1989). If {M1, . . . , Mk} is a Morse decomposition
for S0 ∩ GA, then model (5) is permanent if and only if each of the components Mi
are unsaturated.

Then Theorem 3.2 and 3.5 imply the following result:

Theorem 3.6. If {M1, . . . , Mk} is a Morse decomposition for S0∩GA and condition
(i) of Theorem 3.2 holds for each of the components of the Morse decomposition,
then model (5) is robustly permanent.

The following lemma is used in the proof of Theorem 3.6

Lemma 3.7. Let M ⊂ S0 be an isolated set and {M1, . . . , Mk} be a Morse decom-
position of M for the map ΦA restricted to S0. Then, for suﬃciently small δ > 0,
there is an non empty subset {i1, . . . , il} ⊂ {1, . . . , k} such that the set of continu-
ation {Mi1(δ), . . . , Mil(δ)} is a Morse decomposition of the continuation M (δ) for
the map ΦAδ restricted to S0.
Proof. Let M ⊂ S0 be an isolated subset and {M1, . . . , Mk} be a Morse decompo-
sition of M for the map ΦA restricted to S0. Then, from Theorem 3.10 in Patr˜ao
[2007], there exists a strictly increasing sequence of attractors in M

(8)

Note that the ﬁrst inclusion in equation (9) is strict, since M1 = A1 is an attrac-
tor and then it has a nonempty continuation. Hence, there exists a non-empty
subset {i1, ..., il} ⊂ {1, ..., k} such that the inclusions in (9) restricted to the in-
dices in this subset are strict. Thus, again from Theorem 3.10 in Patr˜ao [2007],
{Mi1(δ), . . . , Mil(δ)} is a Morse decomposition of M (δ) for the map ΦAδ .

(cid:3)

A = GA\S0. Since the model (5) is permanent, G0

Proof of Theorem 3.6. Theorems 3.2 and 3.5 and Lemma 3.7 imply that, for suf-
ﬁciently small δ > 0, the model (5), with A replaced by Aδ, is permanent. Let
R = GA ∩ S0 and G0
A is the
interior global attractor of ΦA. Then we have that (G0
A, R) is an attractor-repeller
pair for GA. Let N ⊂ Rn
+ with N ∩ S0 = ∅ be an isolating neighborhood of
A. Hence, for suﬃciently small δ, (G0
G0
A(δ), R(δ)) is an attractor-repeller pair for
GA(δ), and G0
A(δ) ⊂ N . Since the model (5), corresponding to δ, is permanent,
R(δ) = GA(δ)∩ S0. Hence there is a common region of repulsion around the bound-
ary which concludes the proof.

(cid:3)

For two species models, Theorem 3.6 and Proposition 3.4 provide a precise charac-
terization of robust permanence. The twice continuously diﬀerentiable assumption
is only required to show the necessity of the conditions of the proposition for robust
permanence.
Corollary 3.8. Assume m = 2 and x 7→ xA(x) is twice continuously diﬀerentiable.
Then model (5) is robustly permanent if and only if

• maxi ri(0) > 0,
• r2(µ) > 0 for any ergodic measure µ with species(µ) = {1}, and
• r1(µ) > 0 for any ergodic measure µ with species(µ) = {2}.

Proof. Suppose that the three conditions hold. Since maxi ri(0) > 0, we can choose

positive p1, p2 such thatPi piri(0) > 0. Let µ be an ergodic measure µ supported
in GA ∩ S0. We will show that Pi piri(µ) > 0.

If µ = δ0, then we are done as
ri(µ) = ri(0). If µ 6= δ0, then species(µ) = {j} for some j ∈ {1, 2}. Since rj(µ) = 0,

ROBUST PERMANENCE FOR ECOLOGICAL MAPS

9

we have Pi piri(µ) = pℓrℓ(µ) where ℓ 6= j. By the second and third conditions,
rℓ(µ) > 0. Hence, Pi piri(µ) > 0 for all ergodic µ supported in S0∩GA. Applying

Theorem 3.6 with Morse decomposition M1 = S0∩GA completes the proof of this
implication.
Now suppose one of the conditions doesn’t hold. Then Proposition 3.4 with
(cid:3)

M = S0∩GA implies model (5) is not robustly permanent.

Theorem 3.6 and Proposition 3.4 also characterize models (5) for which the model
and its restriction to any subset of species is robustly permanent. That is, for any
+ is robustly per-

non-empty set I ⊆ {1, ..., m}, the system (5) restricted toQi∈I

manent. This characterization is the discrete-time extension of [Mierczy´nski and Schreiber,
2002, Theorem 3.3] to structured population models. In particular, we have the fol-
lowing

0∩GA. Fix j ∈ {1, . . . , k}, and let µ
be an ergodic probability measure with µ(Mj) = 1. Note that species(µ) 6= I. Then
by Proposition 4.15, for every i ∈ species(µ) we have that ri(µ) = 0, while for every
i ∈ I \ species(µ) we have ri(µ) > 0 (by assumption (10)). Thus, condition (ii) in
Theorem 3.2 holds with pi = 1 for all i ∈ I. Hence Mj is robustly unsaturated with
respect to (11). Theorem 3.6 implies (11) is robustly permanent.
For the converse, suppose that there exists µ an ergodic probability measure
with support in S0 such that rl(µ) ≤ 0 for some l ∈ {1, . . . , m}\species(µ). Let

Let M be a metric space, and let P(M ) be the space of Borel probability measures on
M endowed with the weak∗ toplogy. The support of a measure ν in P(M ), denoted
by supp(ν), is the smallest closed set B ⊂ Rn
+ such that µ(B) = 1. If M ′ is also
a metric space and f : M → M ′ is Borel measurable, then the induced linear map
f ∗ : P(M ) → P(M ′) associates with ν ∈ P(M ) the measure f ∗(ν) ∈ P(M ′) deﬁned
by

f ∗(ν)(B) = ν(f −1(B))

for all Borel sets B in M ′. If θ : M → M is a continuous map, a measure ν ∈ P(M )
is called θ-invariant if ν(θ−1(B)) = ν(B) for all Borel sets B ∈ M . A set B ⊂ M is

The following propositions and lemma are crucial for the proof of Theorem 3.2.
Proposition 4.1. For all x ∈ int Rn
+, every weak∗ limit point µ of the family of
probability measures {Λt(x)}t∈N belongs to Inv(ΦA)(GA) and satisﬁes ri(µ) ≤ 0 for
all i.
Lemma 4.2. Let x ∈ S0 and µ be a weak∗ limit point of the family of probability
measures {Λt(x)}t∈N. Then

ri(x) ≥ ri(µ) for i = 1, . . . , m.

We call an invariant measure µ for model (5) saturated if ri(µ) ≤ 0 for all i.

Proposition 4.3. Let (δn)n≥1 be a non-negative sequence that converges to zero,
and (An)n≥0 be a sequence of δn-perturbations of model (5). Let {µn}n≥1 be saturated
ΦAn-invariant measures, then the weak* limit points of {µn}n≥1 is a non-empty set
consisting of saturated ΦA-invariant measures.

The proofs of Proposition 4.1, Lemma 4.2, and Proposition 4.3 are postponed to

the end of the section. We now prove Theorem 3.2.
Proof. First we show that (i) ⇔ (ii) ⇔ (iii). For (i) ⇔ (ii) see Hofbauer and Schreiber
[2010]. (ii) is obtained by integrating the inequality in (iii). Finally, we prove that
(ii) ⇒ (iii). Thus, let x ∈ S0 and µ = limk→∞ Λtk (x) be a weak∗ limit point
of the sequence {Λt(x)}t≥1 ∈ Inv(ΦA)(S0). By Lemma 4.2, ri(x) ≥ ri(µ) for all
i = 1, . . . , m. Writing µ as a convex combination of ergodic probability measures,
condition (ii) implies condition (iii).

Now we show (i) implies that M is unsaturated, arguing by contradiction. Sup-
pose that (i) holds and that M is saturated. Theorem 2.1 in Hofbauer and So [1989]
implies that either W s(M ), the stable set of M , contains points in GA \ S0, or M
is not isolated in Rn
+. We will show that in either case there exists a saturated ΦA
invariant measure with support in M which contradicts (i).

Consider the ﬁrst case where there exists an x ∈ W s(M ) \ S0. Let µ be a weak∗
limit point of {Λt(x)}t≥1. Proposition 4.1 implies that µ is a saturated ΦA invariant
measure. On the other hand, since x ∈ W s(M ), supp(µ) ⊂ M .
Now consider the second case where M in not isolated in Rn
+. Then there exists
a sequence {ωn}n∈N of omega limit sets of points in GA \ S0 that accumulate on M .
Let {µn}n∈N be a corresponding sequence of ergodic probability measures supported
by these omega limit sets. Then, Lemma 4.9, Propositions 4.15 and Proposition 4.10
imply that ri(µn) = 0 for all i = 1, ..., m and all n ∈ N. Hence the µn’s are saturated

measures. Proposition 4.3, applied with δn = 0 for all n, implies that {µn}n∈N has
a weak∗ limit point ˜µ that is a saturated ΦA invariant measure with support in M .
This concludes the proof of the claim.

Finally, we show that M is robustly unsaturated. If M is not robustly unsatu-
rated, there exists a sequence {δn}n∈N ⊂ R+ and a corresponding sequence {µn}n∈N
of saturated measures for the δn-perturbations of model (5) with support in the
continuation of M . So again, from Proposition 4.3,{µn}n∈N has a weak∗ limit point
˜µ that is a saturated ΦA invariant measure. Moreover, since the continuation of M
converges to M as δn → 0, ˜µ is supported by M , which contradicts (i).

Lemma 4.2. To this end, deﬁne the space

D := {B : Rn

endowed with the pseudo-metric induced by the norm sup on the compact N1(SA).
Deﬁne the map δ : D → R+ by δ(d) := inf{δ ∈ R+ : d is a δ-perturbation} for
d ∈ D.
In order to prove the robustness result, we need to link the long-term behavior of
model (5) with the long-term behavior of δ-perturbations with small δ. To that end,
we regroup those dynamics under one dynamics over a larger space. Let (An)n≥0 ⊂
D be a sequence of δ(An)-perturbations such that δ(An) → 0 as n → ∞. Deﬁne
the set C := {An : n ≥ 0} ⊂ D. The set C is compact. Indeed, since δ(An) ↓ 0,
properties (i) and (ii) of a δ-perturbation imply that the sequence {An}n converge
uniformly to A in N1(SA). Deﬁne

Assumption H3’ and the fact that δ(An) ↓ 0 imply that, for each c ∈ C, there

G. ROTH, P.L. SALCEANU, AND S.J. SCHREIBER

Without loss of generality, we assume that Vc is the larger open set such that (i)
and (ii) hold.

Fix c ∈ C. Property (ii) of Vc implies that, for every point x ∈ Vc, there exists
a sequence {xt}t∈N ⊂ Vc such that x0 = x, and xt+1 = Φc(xt) for all t ≥ 0. Such
a sequence is called a Φc-positive trajectory. In order to create a past for all those
Φc-positive trajectories, let us pick a point x∗ ∈ int Rn
+\N1(SA), and consider the
sequence space T := (N1(SA) ∪ {x∗})Z endowed with the product topology, and
the homeomorphism ϕ : T → T called shift operator, and deﬁned by ϕ({xt}t∈Z) =
{xt+1}t∈Z. Since N1(SA) ∪ {x∗} is compact, the space T is compact as well.
Every Φc-positive trajectory can be seen as an element of T by creating a ﬁxed
past (i.e. xt = x∗ for all t < 0). Deﬁne Gc ⊂ T as the set of such Φc-positive
trajectories, and Ec =St∈Z ϕt(Gc) ⊂ T. In words, Ec is the adherence in T of the
set of all shifted (by ϕt for some t ∈ Z) Φc-positive trajectories. Since Ec is a closed
subset of the compact T, it is compact as well. Deﬁne

Γ := [c∈C

(Ec × {c}) ,

subset of the product space T× C. From now on, when we write (x, c) ∈ Γ, we mean
x = {xt}t∈Z ∈ Ec and c ∈ C.
Lemma 4.5. Γ is a compact subset of T × C.
Proof. Since T × C is compact, we need only to show that Γ is closed. Let (x, c) ∈
T × C and {(xn, cn)}n≥0 ⊂ Γ be a sequence converging to (x, c). By deﬁnition of C,
we need only to consider the case c = A and show that x ∈ EA. Deﬁne the closed set
W := {x ∈ N1(SA) : ∃(nk)k ↑ ∞, (xk)k ∈ T s.t. xk ∈ Vcnk∀k and x = limk→∞ xk}.
We claim that

ΦA(W ) ⊂ W.
Let x ∈ W and (xk)k ∈ T such that xk ∈ Vcnk
ε > 0. For k large enough |ΦA(x) − Φcnk
|Φcnk

(xk)| ≤ ε. Then

(x) − Φcnk

and x = (xk)k≥0, then for all k ≥ 0, xn
either xk = x∗, or xk ∈ W ⊂ VA.
ΦA(xk) = xk+1. Hence x ∈ EA. This concludes the proof.

By deﬁnition of the sets Ec, Ec × {c} are invariant under Θ. In particular, Γ is
invariant under Θ, which implies that the restriction Θ(cid:12)(cid:12)Γ of Θ to Γ is well-deﬁned.
To simplify the presentation we still denote this restriction by Θ. The projection
map π0 : Γ → N1(SA) ∪ {x∗} × C is deﬁned by π0(x, c) = (x0, c) for all (x, c) ∈ Γ.
The map π0 is continuous and π0(Γ) =Sc∈C (Vc ∪ {x∗} × {c}).

Proof. Fix c ∈ C . First we prove Inv(Φc) ⊂ (p ◦ π0)∗(Inv(Θ)). We show that
the inclusion is satisﬁed for the set of Φc - ergodic measure, and then the general
case follows from the ergodic decomposition theorem. Let µ ∈ Inv(Φc) be an ergodic
measure. Since µ is ergodic, there exist x ∈ Vc such that µ = limt→∞ Λt(x, c). There

that (p ◦ π0)∗(˜µ) = µ.
We now prove Inv(Φc) ⊃ (p ◦ π0)∗(Inv(Θ)). Let ˜µ ∈ Inv(Θ)(Γ+). Therefore the
measure (p ◦ π0)∗(˜µ) is supported by Vc. Let B ⊂ Vc be a Borel set. We have

The second equality follows from the fact that the support of ˜µ is inclued in

+)) ⊂ Inv(Φc)(Vc), and then concludes the proof.

Now, we deﬁne the long-term growth rates of the matrix products (6) over the
extended dynamics Θ.

The map Θ on Γ+ can be seen as the extension of the map Φ onSc∈C (Vc × {c}).
Recall that by deﬁnition of a δ-perturbation c ∈ C, there exist ci : Rn → Mni(R),
for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m} such that for each x ∈ Rn
For each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, deﬁne the maps ˜Ai : Γ → Mni(R) by

˜Ai(x, c) = ci(x0)

We write

˜At
i(x, c) := ˜Ai(x, c)··· ˜Ai(Θt−1(x, c)).

The conjugacy (13) implies that for all c ∈ C and x ∈ Vc, we have

(cid:3)

4.2. Properties of long-term growth rates. In this section, we ﬁrst state an ex-
tension of Proposition 3.2 of Ruelle [1979] that has been proved in Roth and Schreiber
[2014]. We use this extension to deduce some properties on the long-term growth
rates which are crucial for the proof of Propositions 4.1 and 4.3.

Proposition 4.11 (Proposition 8.13 in Roth and Schreiber [2014]). Let Ξ be a
compact space, Ψ : Ξ → Ξ be an homeomorphism. Consider a continuous map
T : Ξ → Md(R) and its transpose T ∗ deﬁned by T ∗(ξ) = T (ξ)∗. Write

and assume that

T t(ξ) = T (ξ)··· T (Ψt−1ξ),

Then there exist continuous maps u, v : Ξ → Rd

+, and

int Rd.

ξ ∈ Ξ such that

(i) the line bundles E (resp. F ) spanned by u(·) (resp. v(·)) are such that
(ii) E (resp. F ) is T, Ψ-invariant (resp. T ∗, Φ−1-invariant), i.e. E(Ψ(ξ)) =

Rd = EL F ⊥ where b ∈ F (ξ)⊥ if and only if hξ, v(ξ)i = 0.
E(ξ)T (ξ) and F (Ψξ)T ∗(Ψξ) = F (ξ), for all ξ ∈ Ξ;

(iii) there exist constants α < 1 and C > 0 such that for all t ≥ 0, and ξ ∈ Ξ,

kbT (ξ)··· T (Ψt−1ξ)k ≤ CαtkaT (ξ)··· T (Ψt−1ξ)k,

for all unit vectors a ∈ E(ξ), b ∈ F (ξ)⊥.

Assumptions H1-H2 imply that each continuous map Ai : Γ → Mni(R) satisﬁes
assumptions A1-A2. Hence Proposition 4.11 applies to each continuous map Ai,
and to the homeomorphism Θ on the compact space Γ. Then, for each of those maps,
there exist row vector maps ui(·), vi(·), their respective vector bundles Ei(·), Fi(·),
and the constant Ci, αi > 0 satisfying properties (i), (ii), and (iii) of Proposition
4.11.

For each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, deﬁne the continuous map ζi : Γ → R by

ζi(γ) := lnkui(γ)Ai(γ)k.

In the rest of this subsection, we deduce from Proposition 4.11 some crucial

properties of the invasions rates.

Proposition 4.12 (Proposition 8.14 in Roth and Schreiber [2014]). For all γ ∈ Γ
and every population i, ri(γ) satisﬁes the following properties:

Proposition 4.13. The invasion rate of each population i with respect to an Θ-
invariant measure ˜µ satisﬁes the following property:

ri(˜µ) =ZΓ

ζi(γ)˜µ(dγ).

Proof. This result is a direct consequence of property (ii) of Proposition 4.12 and
the Birkhoﬀ’s Ergodic Theorem applied to the continuous maps Θ and ζi.
(cid:3)
Proposition 4.14. For all (x, c) ∈ Γ+\Γ0, and every i ∈ {1, . . . , m},

ri(γ) ≤ 0.

Proof. Fix i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, and (x, c) ∈ Γ+\Γ0 with x := p ◦ π0(x, c). In particular,

the deﬁnition of the map Φc. Assumption H3’ implies that there exists T > 0 such
that Φt
c(x) belongs to the compact set Vc for all t ≥ T , which implies that there
exists R > 0 such that kxiAt
i(x, c)k ≤ R for all t ≥ T . Assertion (i) of Proposition
4.12 applied to v = xi concludes the proof.

(cid:3)

4.3. Properties of the empirical occupation measures. Now we give some
properties of the invasion rate with respect to a Θ-invariant probability measure.
Proposition 4.15. For all ˜µ ∈ Inv(Θ)(Γ+) supported by Γ+\Γ0, ri(˜µ) = 0 for all
i ∈ {1, . . . , m}.
Proof. Let ˜µ be such a measure. Fix i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, and deﬁne the set Γi,η :=
{γ ∈ Γ+ : k (p ◦ π0(γ))i k > η}, where (p ◦ π0(γ))i ∈ Rni
+ is the ith sub-vector of
p◦ π0(γ) ∈ Rn
+. By assumption on the measure ˜µ, there exists a real number η∗ > 0
such that ˜µ(Γi,η) > 0 for all η < η∗.

The Poincar´e recurrence theorem applies to the map Θ, and implies that for each

η < η∗,

˜µ({γ ∈ Γi,η| Θt(γ) ∈ Γi,η inﬁnitely often }) = 1.

(16)
Recall that the conjugacy (13) implies that for every γ = (x, c) ∈ Γ+\Γ0 with
p ◦ π0(γ) = x ∈ Vc\S0, we have

p ◦ π0(Θt(γ))i = Φt
= xiAt

i(γ).

Then, equality (16) means that for ˜µ-almost all γ ∈ Γi,η with 0 < η < η∗, kxiAt
i(γ)k >

Γi,1/n = Γ+\Γ0, which completes the proof. (cid:3)
4.4. Proof of Proposition 4.1.

generality by considering {Λt(ΦT
limit points of the family of probability measures {Λt(ΦT

compact subset of P(VA). Let µ = limk→∞ Λtk (x) be such a weak∗ limit point.

4.6. Proof of Proposition 4.3. Let {µn}n≥1 be saturated invariant measures for
the δ(An)-perturbations

Xt+1 = XtAn(Xt),

of model (5) deﬁned at the beginning of the section. Assumption H3’ implies
that each measure µn is supported by the compact set SAn ⊂ N1(SA). By weak*
compactness of Borel probability measures on the compact set N1(SA), there exist
weak* limit points of {µn}n≥0. Let µ ∈ P(N1(SA)) be such a weak* limit point. To
ease the reading, when An is on subscript or superscript, we write only n.
Now, we show that µ ∈ Inv(φA). Lemma 4.9 implies that for all n ≥ 1 there
+) such that (p ◦ π0)∗(˜µn) = µn. By compactness of
is a measure ˜µn ∈ Inv(Θ)(Γn
Inv(Θ)(Γ+), let ˜µ := limk→∞ ˜µnk ∈ Inv(Θ)(Γ+). The continuity of p ◦ π0 implies
that (p ◦ π0)∗(˜µ) = µ. We claim that supp(˜µ) ⊂ ΓA
+. For each k ≥ 1, deﬁne
Bk :=[l≥k
Γnl

+.

Note that Bk+1 ⊂ Bk for all k ≥ 1 and Tk Bk = ΓA
+. Moreover Bk is closed for
all k ≥ 1. Indeed, the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 4.5 can be used.
Since supp( ˜µnk ) ⊂ Γnk
+ for all k ≥ 1, limm→∞ ˜µm(Bk) = 1 for all k ≥ 1. The
Portmanteau theorem (see e.g. Theorem 2.1 in Billingsley [1999]) implies that for
all k ≥ 1, ˜µ(Bk) = 1. Then ˜µ(ΓA
the claim. Lemma 4.9 and the claim imply that µ ∈ Inv(ΦA)(VA)
imply that, for all n ≥ 0 and all i,

+) = ˜µ(Tk Bk) = limk→∞ ˜µ(Bk) = 1. This proves
ri(µn) =ZΓ+

Next, we show that ri(µ) ≤ 0 for all i. Proposition 4.13 and Proposition 4.10

ζi(γ)d˜µn,

with the convention that µ0 = µ and ˜µ0 = ˜µ. On the other hand, by assumption,
ri(µn) ≤ 0 for all n ≥ 1 and all i. Then, the continuity of ζi and the convergence of
(˜µn)n to ˜µ for the weak∗ topology imply that ri(µ) ≤ 0. (cid:4)

5. Applications

5.1. Lotka-Volterra diﬀerence equations. Even for models without population
structure (i.e. ni = 1 for all i), our results extend results of [Garay and Hofbauer,
2003] from homeomorphisms to non-invertible maps. An important class of these
non-invertible maps are the discrete-time Lotka-Volterra equations introduced by
[Hofbauer et al., 1987] which are of the form

xt+1 = xt ◦ exp(Bxt + c)

(17)
where B is a m × m matrix, c is a column vector of length m, exp(·) denotes
component-wise exponentiation, and ◦ denotes component-wise multiplication. A
key feature of these equation is a time averaging property [Hofbauer et al., 1987,
Lemma 2.4]. Speciﬁcally, let I ⊂ {1, . . . , m} correspond to a subset of species and
K be a compact invariant set contained in

int RI

+ := {x ∈ Rm

+ : xi > 0 for all i ∈ I and xi = 0 for all i /∈ I},

then there exists a sequence tk ↑ ∞ and an equilibrium ˆx ∈ int RI

+ such that

whenever x0 ∈ K. In particular, this averaging property implies if µ is an ergodic
measure with species(µ) = I and there is a unique equilibrium ˆx (which is generically
true) in int RI

+, then

ri(µ) =

Bij ˆxj + cj

mXj=1

for all i. Applying Theorem 3.6, we get the following result.
Theorem 5.1. Let B be an m × m matrix and c be a m × 1 vector such that the
Lotka-Volterra diﬀerence equation (17) is dissipative. Let p1, . . . , pm be positive reals
such that

(18)

mXi=1

pi
mXj=1

Bij ˆxj + cj > 0

for every equilibrium ˆx ∈ S0, then the Lotka-Volterra diﬀerence equation (17) is
robustly permanent.

The permanence condition (18) is the same condition described by Hofbauer et al.
[1987, Theorem 2.5]. However, Theorem 5.1 implies the stronger result that per-
manence persists following suﬃciently small perturbations of the right hand side of
(17). For example, consider the following model of competing annual plants with a
seed bank

(19)

xi
t+1 = gixi

t expYi −

kXj=1

Cijgjxj

t + (1 − gi)sixi

where xi
t is the density of seeds for species i, gi is the fraction of seeds of species
i germinating each year, exp(Yi) is the yield of a germinating seed of species i in
the absence of competition, si ∈ [0, 1) is the annual seed survivorship probability of
species i, and Cij > 0 is the competitive eﬀect of germinated individuals of species j
on germinated individuals of species i. Applying Theorem (5.1) yields the following
corollary.

Corollary 5.2. Let Cij > 0 and Yi > 0 for all i, j. If there exist pi > 0 such that

mXi=1

piYi −

mXj=1

Cij ˆxj > 0

for every equilibrium ˆx ∈ S0, then there exists ˜g ∈ (0, 1) such that the annual plant
model (19) is permanent for all g ∈ (˜g, 1)m.
Proof. To apply Theorem 5.1, we need to verify that the annual plant model (19) is
dissipative. Deﬁne ˜c = mini Cii, and ˜y = maxi Yi. As z exp(˜y−˜cz) ≤ exp(˜y−1)/˜c =:
a for all z ≥ 0, we have

gixi expYi −

kXj=1

Cijgjxj ≤ gixi exp (Yi − Ciigixi) ≤ a

for all x ∈ [0,∞)m. Deﬁne b = mini(1 − gi) < 1.
Let xt be a solution to the annual plant model (19) and let ext be a solution to
the linear diﬀerence equation

ext+1 = a(1, 1, . . . , 1)T + bext

t for all t ≥ 0 and i. By assumption, these
inequalities hold for t = 0. Now assume that they holds for some t ≥ 0. Then
inequality (20) and our choice of b implies

t ≥ xi

with ex0 = x0. We claim that exi
Since limt→∞exi

t = a/(1 − b) < ∞ for all i, it follows that the global attractor of the
annual plant model (19) lies in the cube [0, a/(1 − b)]k and the system is dissipative
as claimed.

5.2. Competitve metacommunities. Metacommunities are “populations of com-
munities” in which interacting species live in a ﬁnite number k of patches coupled by
dispersal. Here we consider a Lotka-Voltera metacommunities with two competing
species. Let X i
t ) denote the row vector of populations abundances
in the diﬀerent patches for species i at time t ∈ N. Let Bj be a 2 × 2 matrix
with positive entries representing the competition coeﬃcients in patch j, and cj be
a positive 2 × 1 vector representing intrinsic rates of growth in patch j. For each
species i, let Di = (di
jℓ){1≤j,ℓ≤k} be a column stochastic matrix whose j, ℓ-th entry
corresponds to the fraction of individuals of species i in patch ℓ that disperse to
patch j. Deﬁne the ﬁtness of the species i in patch j as a function f i
j of the density
deﬁned, for each x ∈ R2k

While Corollary 3.8 provides a characterization of robust permanence for the
dynamics of (21), evaluating ri(µ) for ergodic measures is, in general, challenging.
However, using a perturbation result and the averaging property of Lotka-Volterra
diﬀerence equations, we can prove the following result.

Theorem 5.3. Assume Di are primitive and suﬃciently close to the identity matrix
i.e. di

jj ≈ 1 for all i, j. Then the model (21) is robustly permanent if

and not permanent if one of the inequalities is reversed.

The condition for robust permanence correspond to each competitor being able
to invade the equilibrium determined by the other competitor in some patch when
the dynamics are not coupled by dispersal. This simple condition holds despite the
dynamics of each competitor potentially being chaotic.

The proof of Theorem 5.3 follows from Corollary 3.8 and the following lower

bound for the ri(µ). To this end, deﬁne Si
where only population i is present.

5.3. An SIR Epidemic Model . A fundamental model in epidemiology is the SIR
model where S is the density of individuals susceptible to the disease, I is the density
of infected individuals, and R is the density of removed individuals. If individuals
die at a constant rate m and encounter one another at the contact rate β, then a
discrete-time version of this model is

(27)

St+1 = f (St + It + Rt)(St + It + Rt) + e−m−βItSt

which guarantees the existence of the global compact trapping region SA in assump-

Let N = S + I + R be the total population size. Then (27) is equivalent to

given by

(31)

Nt+1 = [f (Nt) + e−m]Nt.

While the matrix A2(X) is not irreducible, we can use remark 3.3 and decomposed
it into irreducible components, A1
2(X) = (e−m).
In particular, for any invariant probability measure µ, we have

2(X) = (e−m(N − I− R)u(I)) and A2

r1(µ) = Z log(f (N ) + e−m) µ(dN dIdR)
r2(µ) = max(cid:26)Z log(e−m(N − I − R)u(I)) µ(dN dIdR),−m(cid:27)

Let us assume that the population persists in the absence of the disease i.e. r1(0) =
ln(f (0) + e−m) > 0. Theorem 3.6 implies that there is a positive global attractor
M2 ⊂ R+×{0}×{0} for the SIR dynamics restricted to R+×{0}×{0}. It follows that
{M1 = {(0, 0, 0)}, M2} is a Morse decomposition of S0. As r1(0) > 0 by assumption,
Theorem 3.6 implies robust permanence ifR log((N − I − R)u(I)) µ(dN dIdR) > m
for all invariant probability measures µ with support in M2. As a particular case,
consider f to be of the form f (x) = 1
1+cx , for some constant c > 0. f satisﬁes (28)
and 1 + f ′(x) > 0 for all x ≥ 0. This implies that forward orbits of (31) always
converge to the globally stable equilibrium ¯x := (1/c)(1/√1 − e−m−1). Thus, in this
case, M2 = {¯x}, and (29) is robustly permanent if (e−mβ/c)(1/√1 − e−m − 1) > 1.
