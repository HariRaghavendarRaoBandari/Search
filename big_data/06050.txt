Abstract

Recently, the authors of ([2]) empirically showed that over the 1958-2014 horizon, the returns of the MaxMedian
S&P 500 portfolio (see [3]) substantially exceed both those of the market capitalization weighted S&P 500 portfolio
as well as those of the equally weighted S&P 500 portfolio.
In this work, we ﬁnd superior S&P 500 portfolio
weighting strategies to that of the MaxMedian rule, calculated over an updated 1958-2015 time horizon. The
portfolio weighting strategies we consider are the seven transformations of Tukey’s transformational ladder ([5]):
√
1/x2, 1/x, 1/
x, x, x2 (in our setting, x is the market capitalization weighted portfolio). We ﬁnd that
the 1/x2 weighting strategy produces cumulative returns which signiﬁcantly dominate all other portfolios, posting
an annual geometric mean return of 20.889 %. In addition, we show that the 1/x2 weighting strategy is superior to
√
a 1/x weighting strategy, which is in turn superior to a 1/
x weighted portfolio, and so forth, culminating with the
x2 transformation, whose cumulative returns are the lowest of the seven transformations of Tukey’s transformational
ladder. It is astonishing that the ranking of portfolio performance (from best to worst) precisely follows that of the
late John Tukey’s transformational ladder.

Introduction

Our story begins with our recent paper ([2]), in which we consider the MaxMedian rule, a nonproprietary rule designed
for the investor who wishes to do his/her own investing on a laptop with the purchase of only 20 stocks. The rule,
which was ﬁrst discovered by the second author in [1] and was further documented in [3], is summarized below:

1. For the 500 stocks in the S&P 500, obtain the daily returns S(j, t) for the preceding year.
2. Compute daily ratios as follows: r(j, t) = S(j, t)/S(j, t-1).
3. Sort these ratios for the year’s trading days.
4. Discard all values of r equal to one.
5. Examine the 500 medians of the ratios.
6. Invest equally in the 20 stocks with the largest medians.
7. Hold for one year and then liquidate. Repeat steps 1-6 again for each future year.

According to the second author, MaxMedian was not implemented with any hope that it would beat equal weight
on the S&P 500. Recently, the authors of ([2]) empirically showed that over the 1958-2014 horizon, the returns
of the MaxMedian S&P 500 portfolio ([3]) not only exceeded those of the market capitalization weighted S&P 500
portfolio (MKC), but also exceeded those of the equally weighted S&P 500 portfolio (EQU). The key result of ([2])
is reproduced in Figure 1 below.

assumes that $100 is invested on 1/2/58, and is left to grow until 12/31/14.

Table 1 shows that the cumulative return for MaxMedian ($34,291) beats EQU ($27,601) by a factor of 1.24, and
that MaxMedian ($34,291) beats MKC ($5,212) by a factor of 6.58.
With Table 1 in hand, the authors of [2] conclude with the following note “One could, in principle, continue searching
for weighting schemes which do even better than MaxMedian, but such a study is beyond the scope of this paper.”
In the current paper, we pick up where our work in ([2]) leaves oﬀ.
When considering transformations of variables, it is natural to defer to the work of the late John Tukey. Of the many
contributions of the late John Tukey, perhaps one of the most fundamental to the applied statistics community is
the “Tukey transformational ladder.” ([4], [5]) The ladder gives a sequence of transformations of a variable x. The
√
sequence is given in the following order: 1/x2, 1/x, 1/
x, x, x2. Here, x is the market capitalization
weighting portfolio (MKC), and so the aforementioned transformations are each diﬀerent reweightings of the S&P
500 market capitalization portfolio. In this paper, we will show, empirically, that the 1/x2 weighting applied to the
S&P 500 portfolio from 1958-2015 performs astonishingly well. Its performance is followed, in descending order, by
√
the 1/x weighted portfolio, the 1
x weighted portfolio, the
MKC portfolio, and the x2 weighted portfolio. It is astonishing that the order of portfolio performance (from best to
worst) follows exactly that of John Tukey’s transformational ladder.
We illustrate below how the 1/x2 weighting strategy, applied to the market capitalization weighted portfolio, is
implemented. For simplicity, let us consider a portfolio with two equities. Suppose that equity I carries 40% of

x weighted portfolio, the log(x) weighted portfolio, the

(approximately .692) to equity I and a weight of approximately .308 to equity II.

2 Data acquisition and index methodology

2.1 Data acquisition

This dataset considered in this paper is the S&P 500 in the time frame from January 1958 to December 2015 (in [2],
2015 data was unavailable at the time of writing, so the authors only considered data from January 1958 to December
2014). As in [2], all data was acquired from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) 1. CRSP provides a
reliable list of S&P 500 index constituents, their respective daily stock prices, shares outstanding, and any key events
(i.e., stock splits, acquisitions, etc.).

2.2 Index methodology

As in [2], we calculate the index returns for all of the Tukey transformations of the market capitalization S&P 500
portfolio according to the index return formula as documented by CRSP 2. CRSP computes the return on an index
(Rt) as the weighted average of the returns for the individual securities in the index according to the following equation

P
P
i ωi,t × ri,t

i ωi,t

Rt =

,

(1)

where Rt is the index return, ωi,t is the weight of security i at time t, and ri,t is the return of security i at time t.

3 Main results

3.1 Cumulative return of S&P 500 from 1958 to 2015

We employ the CRSP database and the methodology documented in Section 2.
In Figure 2 below, we display
the cumulative returns (from 1958 to 2015) of the market capitalization weighted S&P 500 portfolio (MKC), the
equally weighted S&P 500 portfolio (EQU), the MaxMedian S&P 500 portfolio, and the portfolios given by the
x, x2), where we again recall that MKC is represented by x.
Tukey transformations (1/x2, 1/x, 1/
The calculation assumes that we invest $100 in each of these nine portfolios on 1/2/58 and that we calculate the
cumulative values of these portfolios on 12/31/15. Dividend payments are excluded from all calculations, both here
and throughout this paper.

We may better examine Figure 2 by plotting it on the log10 scale, as we do in Figure 3 below.

To compare the cumulative returns of the nine portfolios considered in Figure 2 and Figure 3, we produce Table 2
below, which lists the value of each portfolio on 12/31/15.

lation assumes that $100 is invested on 1/2/58 and is left to grow until 12/31/15.

To cross-validate our work, we present the cumulative values on 12/31/15 for the tickers SPX (CRSP’s deﬁned S&P
500 market capitalization portfolio) and SPW (CRSP’s deﬁned S&P 500 equally weighted portfolio) below in Table
3.

Table 3: The values on 12/31/15 for SPX and SPW.

The above table validates our calculations in Table 2. Our cumulative EQU ﬁgure ($26,401) is almost identical to
that obtained by SPW ($26,920). Similarly, our cumulative MKC ﬁgure ($5,191) is nearly identical to that of SPX
($5,019).

3.2 Discussion of Table 2

It is shocking that the 1/x2 portfolio’s value on 12/31/15 dominates all other eight portfolios by a substantial
margin. Table 2 shows that investing $100 in January 1958 in the 1/x2 portfolio would give one an ending value of
$6,005,167 in December 2015. This is almost six million dollars greater than MKC’s ending value of $5,191!
The 1/x2 transformation assigns the large majority of its weight to the lowest cap stocks of the S&P 500, very little
weight to the larger cap stocks of the S&P 500, and almost no weight to the largest cap stocks of the S&P 500.
Consequently, 1/x2 reaps the beneﬁts from the smaller cap stocks of the S&P 500, which present more opportunity
for growth.
Secondly, it is very surprising that the ending values of the portfolios follow Tukey’s transformational ladder. That
is, the ending value of the 1/x2 portfolio is greatest, followed by the 1/x portfolio, followed by the 1/
x portfolio,
√
followed by the log(x) portfolio, followed by the
x portfolio, followed by the x (MKC) portfolio, and ending with
the x2 portfolio. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to discover this phenomenon.
Finally, fulﬁlling our promise in ([2]) that “one could, in principle, continue searching for weighting schemes which do
even better than MaxMedian,” Table 2 indeed shows that that four portfolios dominate MaxMedian. They are the
1/x2 weighted portfolio, the 1/x weighted portfolio, the 1/
x weighted portfolio, and the log(x) weighted portfolio.

3.3 Annual rates of return for MKC, EQU, MaxMedian, and Tukey transformation portfolios

In Tables 4 and 5, we display annual returns (in %) of the MKC, EQU, MaxMedian, and Tukey transformation
portfolios. We also display the annual returns of SPW (CRSP’s equal weight portfolio) and SPX (CRSP’s market cap
weight portfolio). Note how close the annual returns for EQU and MKC are to the reported SPW and SPX numbers.
This precision serves to further cross-validate our calculations.
In Table 5, we see that geometric mean (calculated from annual returns from 1958 to 2015) of the 1/x2 transformation is
√
x transformation is
20.899%, the geometric mean of the 1/x transformation is 16.363 %, the geometric mean of the 1/
12.575 %, the geometric mean of the
x transformation is 8.359 %, the geometric mean of the x (MKC) transformation
is 7.047 %, and the geometric mean of the x2 transformation is 5.378 %. The MaxMedian geometric mean is 10.488
% and the EQU geometric mean is 10.091 %. Note that the geometric mean of the 1/x2 portfolio beats that of the
MKC portfolio by a factor of 2.96.

√

Tables 4 and 5 post considerably large annual returns (in absolute value) for the 1/x2 transformation, as well as
for other transformations. Consequently, we present Figure 4, which shows the number of S&P 500 constituents, by
calendar year, which grew 50% or more. In 1976, 88 companies grew by at least 50 % and 14 companies grew by at
least 100 %. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to see a corresponding annual return for the 1/x2 portfolio of 99.650
%. It is interesting to note that in 2009, 141 companies grew by at least 50 %, 43 companies grew by at least 100 %,
and 12 companies grew by at least 200 %.

3.4 Performance of the 1/x2 portfolio in recent market crashes

A striking feature of the 1/x2 portfolio is that it fared quite well (at least in comparison to the market capitalization
weighted portfolio) in the crashes of 2001 and 2008. Table 5 shows that in 2001, 1/x2 lost .07 %, whereas MKC lost
13.301%. Table 5 further shows that in 2008, 1/x2 lost 16.724 %, whereas MKC lost 37.976 % (in fact, no other
portfolio other than 1/x2 lost less than 30% in 2008). It is also worthy to note that of the 58 years from 1958-2015,
1/x2 posts 18 years with negative returns. This is only slightly more than MKC, which posts 17 years with negative
returns, and EQU, which posted 15 years of negative returns.

4 Conclusion

The conclusion is twofold. Firstly, we have shown that there are indeed portfolios that are superior to MaxMedian.
The work of [2] showed that the MaxMedian beat the MKC portfolio annually by 3.441 % in geometric mean. However,
this is a small triumph when compared to that of the 1/x2 transformation, which handily beats the MKC portfolio
annually by 13.842 % in geometric mean. But the importance of the 1/x2 transformation is best told by Figure 2,
which shows that if an investor started with $100 in January 1958 and invested in a 1/x2 portfolio, then he or she
would have over $6,000,000 dollars in December 2015. In stark contrast, if one did the same with a MKC portfolio,
one would have $5,191 in December 2015.
If the past is any indicator of the future, hedge fund managers could
immensely proﬁt by establishing a 1/x2 weighted S&P 500 mutual fund.
Secondly, we have shown that the sequence of the Tukey transformations,

1/x2, 1/x, 1/

√

x, log(x),

√

x, x, x2

give decreasing returns when applied to weighting of the S&P 500 portfolio from 1958-2015. We will explore this
phenomenon on more theoretical ground in future work.
