A review of the current challenges for the understanding of the physics of extragalactic radio jets
from supermassive black holes is presented. Also, a prospect is given about how both very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI) and polarimetric observations help us to understand their physics
and the ones of their magnetic ﬁelds. This paper focuses on the impact that previous ultra-high
resolution polarimetric surveys have had on our current knowledge on radio loud AGN. It ﬁrst
concentrates on the expectations about the improvement that the Square Kilometer Array, used as
a super-sensitive VLBI station on existing and future very long baseline interferometric arrays,
will provide in terms of access to new source classes, and in terms of a deeper portion of the
Universe than currently accessible. A series of key new radio loud AGN science ﬁelds, to be
opened by the Square Kilometer Array, are outlined together with a collection of preliminary
ideas about possible programs of interest to deep in such ﬁelds. The complementary aspects of
future super-sensitive VLBI observations as compared to deep continuum surveys with the Square
Kilometer Array and its precursors are also outlined here.

Radio-loud AGN-jet morphology and polarization: the role of ultra-high resolution radio surveys

1. Introduction

Relativistic jets in radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic ob-
jects known so far, and among the brighter radio emitting objects in the sky. The jets from this
kind of objects can emit prominent and extremely variable polarized synchrotron radiation at all
spectral bands from radio to g -rays. An inverse Compton component of emission is also possible,
perhaps even prominent, at high energies (from X-rays to g -rays) in this kind of objects. Bright
radio-loud AGN are ubiquitous in the sky, and therefore are expected to appear in nearly any new
extragalactic radio survey (either deep or not). Since they are highly luminous, they can be detected
up to large cosmological distances, which opens the opportunity for the study of the astrophysics
of yet unexplored ages of the Universe. For this, future ultra-high sensitivity radio-surveys (see
e.g., Agudo et al. 2015) such as those starting to be planned for the main scientiﬁc cases driving the
Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project (Braun et al. 2015) will be instrumental. Moreover, the po-
larized nature of the radio emission in radio-loud AGN jets makes them ideal background sources
for studies of the large scale magnetic ﬁeld of the Universe (Gaensler et al. 2015; Johnston-Hollitt
et al. 2015; Taylor et al. 2015).

The jet formation, collimation and acceleration processes are among the most relevant but
most poorly known problems on current jet astrophysics. We have recently started to understand
these processes with unprecedented detail from the numerical point of view. However, we are
still lacking most information and conﬁrmations from the observational side. We know that the
essential ingredients to produce relativistic jets in AGN are the large gravitational potential of
the central rotating supermassive black hole (SMBH), the surrounding material from the rotating
accretion disk, and its co-rotating magnetic ﬁeld. This makes jet formation studies a powerful tool
to probe the environment of SMBH, and the physics of high-energy plasmas, and their magnetic
ﬁelds. Therefore, ultimately, AGN relativistic jet studies aim to attack fundamental problems in
physics. Obviously, because of the key role of magnetic ﬁelds in the formation and evolution of
relativistic jets, polarization studies of these objects have the potential to provide key information
to understand the processes involved.

During the latest years theoretical argumentation has made clear that after formation, for jets
to be efﬁciently collimated, a mechanisms would need to operate producing stratiﬁed jets in both
composition (outer electron-proton wind, inner electron-positron) and speeds. In this case, jets can
produce an ultrafast and light relativistic jet spine mainly composed of electron-positron plasma,
plus a slower and heavy sheath mainly composed of electrons and protons. This issue about jet
composition is another of the current great challenges that needs to be solved from the observa-
tional perspective. There are many chances that future instruments like SKA, with multiple high-
frequency, and high-precision, full polarization capabilities, will have the opportunity to make a
big step forward in this ﬁeld. This will beneﬁt from the use of the ultra-high angular resolution
feature of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) in combination with SKA as an additional
super-sensitive station (SKA-VLBI, Paragi et al. 2015).

After their formation in the innermost scales of the AGN, powerful relativistic jets can keep
well collimated up to scales that are far larger than the size of their host galaxies. But there is still
a relevant problem regarding that observational fact: how can jets radiate such enormous amount
of power (up to ∼ 1048 erg/s) from the sub–pc scales, up to scales of hundreds of kpc (or even

2

larger)? For the case of AGN jets, this is related to an additional fundamental question: how
and at what distance from the central engine Poynting-ﬂux dominated outﬂows are converted into
kinetic dominated jets? These two fundamental questions are related to a general lack of our
current understanding of the particle acceleration processes. Among these processes, the three
more feasible ones are diffusive acceleration at the fronts of strong hydrodynamic (HD) shocks,
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) reconnection, and stochastic MHD interactions of particles with
magnetic turbulence. In all these three cases, the resulting non-thermal particle spectra (that can be
measured) depend strongly on the underlying physical conditions, which provides us with a tool
to constraint the kind of acceleration mechanism at work from AGN jet observations. All these
processes take place in the innermost regions of AGN relativistic jets, at the pc and sub-pc scales,
as does the jet formation, collimation and acceleration process. This region, the most compact and
therefore the most poorly understood one, is in general only visible through the ultra-high angular
resolution VLBI, which is therefore key to understand such relevant questions outlined above.

2. Capabilities of current VLBI facilities

A selection of the most relevant VLBI arrays for the kind of studies outlined in this paper con-
tains the European VLBI Network1 (EVN, mainly located in the Euro-Asiatic continent but also
including stations in South Africa and Puerto Rico), the Very Long Baseline Array2 (VLBA, in the
USA), and the Long Baseline Array3 (LBA, in Australia), see Fig 1. Besides combination between
these three arrays (which are certainly possible), these are the three largest ground interferome-
ters, and therefore provide the ﬁnest angular resolutions among all astronomical facilities on Earth
(up to ∼ 0.15 milli-arcseconds at 43 GHz [7 mm]). However, the current record on astronomical
angular resolution (∼ 14m as) comes through VLBI arrays including an orbiting station, i.e.
the
RadioAstron4 orbiting antenna (Kardashev et al. 2012), that still operates successfully and releases
pioneering results (see Kovalev et al., these proceedings).

Typical sensitivities of 10 − 15m Jy/beam (for 1h integration time) are routinely achieved at the
EVN, the most-sensitive VLBI array so far. However, combining the current standard VLBI arrays
with a number of very sensitive stations operating in the northern hemisphere (e.g. EVN involving
the Arecibo 300 m Telescope, the 70 m antenna in Robledo de Chavela, and a number of new 65 m
stations of the EVN [e.g. Sardinia, Italy and Tian Ma, China]; or the VLBA plus the 100m Green
Bank Telescope, the phased JVLA, and the Effelsberg 100m Telescope), the VLBI sensitivity can
be improved by a factor > 3, i.e. up to ∼ 3m Jy/beam/h. The organization of these high-sensitivity
arrays is not a trivial task though, and the standard sensitivities of VLBI observations do not usually
reach such great levels. Furthermore, most of the southern sky is not currently accessible by high-
sensitivity VLBI because of the geographical distribution on the northern hemisphere of such high-
sensitivity arrays.

3. Previous VLBI surveys and some of their achievements

3.1 Continuum VLBI surveys

Most of the large and early total-ﬂux VLBI surveys of radio-loud AGN focused on the study
of the structure and compactness of ﬂat-spectrum radio jets. The observations were performed at 5
GHz with the VLBA, and even with the VLBI Space Observatory Program5 (VSOP, Hirabayashi
et al. 2000b), a project operated by Japan in the late nineties and beginning of the 2000’s that
pioneered VLBI with an orbiting antenna. In the following lines, a (probably biased and certainly
incomplete) set of reference programs is listed. These programs made relevant technical and/or
scientiﬁc contributions to the study of radio-loud AGN jets since mid nineties, when the main
modern VLBI arrays started operating.

The Caltech–Jodrell Bank Survey (CBS, see Taylor et al. 1994; Polatidis et al. 1995, and
references therein), produced VLBA total-ﬂux images at both 5 and 1.7 GHz for a complete ﬂux
density limited sample of 300 bright (S > 350 mJy at ∼ 5 GHz) and ﬂat spectrum AGN. This was
the ﬁrst milli-arcsecond scale morphological classiﬁcation of a very large sample of radio loud
AGN sources.

A few years later, in June 1996, the VLBA Pre-Launch VSOP Survey (Fomalont et al. 2000),
in preparation for a big AGN jet survey with VSOP, made imaging observations of 374 strong ﬂat-
spectrum radio sources north of declination −44◦ using the VLBA at 5 GHz. Among all observed
sources, a large fraction of them were selected for the VSOP survey (Hirabayashi et al. 2000a;
Lovell et al. 2004; Scott et al. 2004; Horiuchi et al. 2004). The VSOP survey observed 294 ﬂat-
spectrum AGN brighter than 1 Jy at 5 GHz. A signiﬁcant fraction of the observed sample (54 %)
was found to display brightness temperatures of the innermost compact cores Tb > 1012 K (with
an observed maximum of Tb = 1.2 × 1013 K). This implied the conﬁrmation of the old standing

Radio-loud AGN-jet morphology and polarization: the role of ultra-high resolution radio surveys

problem of the very-high brightness temperature of ﬂat-spectrum radio-loud AGN that requires a
too large amount of relativistic Doppler beaming, not compatible with the observed proper motions
in a small number of sources. The problem is still not quite solved and it is matter of intense debate.
A detailed update on the status of the problem is provided by Kovalev et al. (these proceedings),
where a comprehensive space VLBI survey of AGN involving the RadioAstron orbiting station to
attack this problem is also presented.

When VLBI arrays started to have enough sensitivity, and the computational power of correla-
tors started to be suited for that, the ﬁrst attempts to image the deep radio sky on wide areas started
to come. Garrett et al. (2001); Chi et al. (2013, and references therein, see also Radcliffe et al. these
proceedings) have been pioneers on very-deep and wide ﬁeld VLBI imaging of compact structures
at large redshifts. This observing method is extremely useful to identify the radio AGN population
on a sample of weak galaxies; for the Hubble Deep Field-North in the case of the above men-
tioned references. In particular, the observations by Chi et al. (2013), made with a Global array at
1.4 GHz, were deeper and wider than any other previous VLBI observations of such ﬁeld (achiev-
ing a minimum rms= 7.3m Jy/beam at 4 milli-arcsecond resolution on a area of the sky extended by
∼ 200 arcminutes2). Although still limited by small number statistics, Chi et al. (2013) found that
25 % of star forming galaxies (SFG) contain faint AGN. Garrett et al. (2001) and Chi et al. (2013)
did not only show the potential of deep and wide ﬁeld VLBI observations for AGN-SFG stud-
ies, but also have demonstrated a tremendously useful application of VLBI to support population
studies from deep surveys with SKA, which addition will greatly enhance the sensitivity.

The mJIVE-20 project (Deller & Middelberg 2014) is, in a sense, a massive extension of the
pioneering work by Garrett et al. (2001) and Chi et al. (2013). This program has imaged hundreds
of different wide ﬁelds and tenths of thousands of sources contained on them down to the milli-
Jansky level. This is the largest 20 cm VLBI imaging survey so far. The project, developed at
the VLBA, took advantage of the multi-phase center correlation capability recently developed in
most VLBI software correlators to image 25973 radio sources from where thousands of new VLBI
sources down to ∼ 1 mJy were detected.

3.2 Polarimetric VLBI surveys

In a pioneering work, Zavala & Taylor (2004) presented the ﬁrst survey for mapping the Fara-
day rotation measure along a big number of (40) different jet sources through VLBA observations
made at seven different frequencies between 8.1 and 15.2 GHz. Their source sample included
quasars, radio galaxies, and BL Lacertae type objects (BL Lacs), that were observed on a single
epoch each. Their results show core rotation measures (RM) of both quasars and BL Lacs ranging
from a few hundreds to a few thousands of rad/m2, with downstream jet features showing smaller
RM . 500 rad/m2, and radio galaxies showing in general much larger jet rotation measures (with
RM in the range of a few hundreds to ∼ 105 rad/m2) than quasars and BL Lacs. Radio galaxy cores
are also generally depolarized, which is consistent with the idea of radio galaxy jets lying close
to the plane of the sky, whereas jets in quasars and BL Lacs point close to the line of sight. The
properties of the Faraday screen were not clear from the early work of Zavala & Taylor (2004, and
references therein), and they are still under debate.

On more recent work, the group by Gabuzda et al. (2015), through a set of VLBA imaging
observations at a maximum of different 7 frequencies (typically from ∼ 5 to ∼ 15 GHz) have shown

5

the existence of systematic Faraday rotation gradients across a signiﬁcant number of parsec scale
jets. This is claimed to be in rather good agreement with the existence of helical magnetic ﬁelds
in the innermost regions of jets. This is not a deﬁnitive prove though, but it is a potential relevant
piece of evidence for the conﬁrmation of jet formation theories. The recent results presented by
the MOJAVE6 (Monitoring Of Jets in Active galactic nuclei with VLBA Experiments) team (Lister
et al. 2009a), i.e. Hovatta et al. (2012), and earlier work made on individual sources (e.g. Zavala &
Taylor 2005; Asada et al. 2008b; Gómez et al. 2008; Asada et al. 2008a), also agree with the claims
by Gabuzda et al. (2015) for helical magnetic ﬁelds threading the jets from radio-loud AGN.

The contribution of the MOJAVE monitoring survey to the knowledge of the radio loud AGN
population on the parsec scales is indeed unprecedented, and certainly not limited to Faraday ro-
tation studies. MOJAVE uses the VLBA to observe the 15 GHz total ﬂux and polarization (linear
and circular) structure of different source samples containing more than 200 sources. The program
monitors sources (since 2002) with a time sampling up to one month, for sources with time scales
of variability of that order. This MOJAVE survey has made important contributions on deﬁning the
kinematic and geometric jet parameters of hundreds of jet sources (Lister et al. 2009a,b; Pushkarev
et al. 2009; Homan et al. 2009a; Savolainen et al. 2010), on deﬁning the jet regions where colli-
mation and acceleration take place (Homan et al. 2015), and on characterizing the full polarization
properties of relativistic AGN radio–jets (Homan & Lister 2006). The latter includes circular po-
larization studies, that are of extreme relevance to make accurate ﬁts and estimates of the actual
macro– and micro–physics determining the observational properties of these sources (Wardle &
Homan 2003; Homan et al. 2009b).

An also extremely useful AGN-jet VLBI monitoring survey is the one maintained by the

Boston University (BU) Blazar Group since 2007; the year when the launch of the Fermi g -ray
Space Telescope (still in operation) was expected. The BU Blazar Monitoring Program7 monitors
a set of ∼ 40 of the brighter blazars and radio galaxies with a time sampling of about one month
with the VLBA both in total ﬂux and with polarimetric sensitivity. One of the nicest properties of
this monitoring survey is that it observes at very high frequencies (43 GHz), and therefore it im-
ages essentially the innermost visible regions of blazar jets, were the sources are still not affected
by synchrotron self-absorption at these high frequencies. This allows for both the total ﬂux and
the polarization properties of the sources to be imaged without of the inﬂuence of opacity effects,
that would greatly distort our view on these inner regions. Therefore, the BU Blazar Monitoring
Program is particularly well suited, and it has been extremely successful, on its combination with
comprehensive sets of multi–spectral–range data (with polarimetry whenever possible), to identify
and characterize the different emitting regions along the spectrum (up to g -rays) and along the
jet. The polarimetric component of the VLBI observations is critical here in many cases where
the identiﬁcation of polarized moving features in the jet with events happening in the optical is
performed through the matching polarization angles of contemporaneous ﬂares. This program has
been demonstrated to be particularly useful in constraining, or even determining, the possible high-
energy emission mechanisms of blazar jets (e.g. Marscher et al. 2008, 2010; Jorstad et al. 2010,
2013; Agudo et al. 2011a,b) which are among the current challenges for high–energy astrophysics.

4. A perspective for future VLBI surveys of radio-loud AGN jets

4.1 New ultra-sensitive VLBI arrays

To have a realistic view of how the ultra-high resolution surveys of radio-loud AGN jets that
are expected to come will impact the astrophysics of these objects, it is important to have an idea of
the instrumental improvements that are planned for the near future. Besides the continuous devel-
opment of digital VLBI backends at virtually all current interferometers, and therefore the resulting
increase of observing bandwidths and sensitivity, the EVN is, among the current VLBI arrays, the
one that proﬁts from a faster addition of new high-sensitivity stations of the class of 65 m antennas
(i.e. the 65 m Sardinia Radio Telescope [Italy], and the Tian Ma 65 m Radio Telescope [China], see
above). Besides that, the greatest jump in sensitivity that is expected in VLBI observations comes
with the advent of the SKA. In its Phase 1 (2020–2030), the South African component of SKA (i.e.
SKA-MID, Braun et al. 2015) is expected to participate on global arrays for VLBI interferometers
where the central core (with ∼ 80 % of the sensitivity of the entire SKA-MID array) will act as a
super-sensitive station. This station will govern the sensitivity of the entire global array (see Paragi
et al. 2015). For the Phase 2 of SKA (from 2030), a new dramatic increase on sensitivity, image ﬁ-
delity, and dynamic range are expected through the use of VLBI observations with a homogeneous
array of SKA-MID stations even involving intercontinental baselines.

For SKA1-MID the concept of the African VLBI Network8 (AVN) is starting to be devel-
oped. This project plans to modify existing, but redundant, dishes previously used for satellite
telecommunication into radio telescopes and VLBI stations in a number of african countries, i.e.

Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zambia. Since
there are no other VLBI stations to cover baselines from a few hundreds to a few thousands of
km, the AVN would give excellent support to a sensitive VLBI array involving SKA1-MID, not to
mention the great value of having a dedicated VLBI array (∼ 100 % of the time) in the southern
hemisphere. Either with or without the AVN, the EVN (covering a similar range of longitudes as
the AVN) will provide support to VLBI observations with SKA-MID. Of course, having the addi-
tional participation of the Australia SKA Pathﬁnder (ASKAP), the LBA, the VLBA, and any other
potential space station (or stations) at that time, would be much more than desirable, but most of
these options would provide only a partial coverage to VLBI observations with SKA-MID. Even
without these options, using the phased SKA1-MID together with the AVN and the EVN it will be
possible to reach ultra-high angular resolutions up to a few tenths of a milliarcsecond at m Jy rms
levels (as well as astrometric precisions up to a few micro/arcseconds only).

4.2 New science with improved VLBI capabilities

One of the most obvious and early applications of VLBI observations involving SKA will be
the identiﬁcation of source populations from previous SKA alone surveys, in particular to distin-
guish radio AGN from star forming galaxies (e.g., Agudo et al. 2015). It is obvious that linear
polarization and spectral index information from such SKA surveys will be a useful tool for that,
as well as, optical data providing either photometric or spectroscopic redshifts. Moreover, VLBI
observations will provide the deﬁnitive conﬁrmation of the AGN nature of those sources detected
with high VLBI brightness temperature exceeding those expected for start forming regions. Po-
larimetric VLBI observations will also be critical for this kind of work, and they come for free in
terms of additional observing time.

The coming high-sensitivity capabilities of VLBI observations open a completely new oppor-
tunity to study the evolution of AGN jets along cosmic time. This is almost an entire new ﬁeld to
explore that needs to answer relevant questions as: when where the ﬁrst AGN formed?, how did
they form?, how were their environments and those of their SMBH and accretion systems? or how
did they evolve with time up to z ∼ 0? To attack these questions, VLBI observations will be instru-
mental not only on the identiﬁcation of sources, but also on the characterization of the properties
of AGN along cosmic time.

In particular, regarding the detection and possible characterization of the ﬁrst AGN SMBH,
their appearance is highly speculative, and there are lots of uncertainties regarding predictions so
far (Rees 1978; Heger et al. 2001; Shapiro 2005). However, simulations predict that dense clouds
might be able to form massive compact objects containing accretion disks (Schleicher et al. 2013)
that would naturally favor the formation of small-scale jet embryos frustrated by the dense environ-
ment (a far-away Universe version of nearby gigahertz peaked radio sources, GPS). This is actually
favorable in terms of the detection of these kind of objects (Afonso et al. 2015), because in these
cases the radio emission is not dramatically affected by IC looses by the dense cosmic microwave
background (CMB). This means that there are possibilities to detect these sources at 100-600 MHz
on the 0.1 mJy at arcsecond resolution, as proposed by Falcke et al. (2004). Again the high resolu-
tion of future ultra-deep VLBI observations involving SKA-LOW (the low frequency component
of SKA in Australia, Braun et al. 2015) and/or SKA-MID (observing at low frequencies) will be
essential to identify and characterize this kind of sources.

8

Radio-loud AGN-jet morphology and polarization: the role of ultra-high resolution radio surveys

An additional application of very–high sensitivity and very–high resolution radio observa-
tions involving future instruments is the detection of radio-loud AGN at high redshifts at z & 8.
Ghisellini et al. (2014) have made a great advance on this topic through simulations of powerful
relativistically-beamed radio-loud AGN (i.e. blazars) at high redshifts. They show that the radio
synchrotron component of the sources fade strongly with redshift by more than 6 orders of magni-
tude in luminosity. This is a consequence of the density of the CMB at high redshifts, that produces
strong high-energy radiative losses. This is responsible for the strong reduction of the relativistic
electron population that radiates the synchrotron radio emission, and therefore the radio spectrum
fades off (see also Afonso et al. 2015). However, Ghisellini et al. (2014) have provided excellent
news on which regards to the potential detection of radio-loud AGN at z ∼ 8 by making use of the
unprecedented sensitivity of the SKA-MID even on its early Phase 1 (see also Agudo et al. 2015).
According to Ghisellini et al. (2014), SKA1 will be able to detect the radio faint emission from
most of the bright blazar population up to z ≈ 8, therefore being able to observe many more jetted
sources than predicted on the basis of current deep radio surveys. Indeed, this will not only allow
cosmological studies of radio-loud AGN since the epoch of the ﬁrst AGN, but also cosmological
studies of the CMB itself. This will be possible by studying the impact of the CMB on the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of blazar jets, as proposed by Ghisellini et al. (2014). These kind of
studies would need to use data from wide-area and deep surveys at the broadest possible frequency
range (both in all SKA bands and at higher frequencies/energies) to characterize the SED of the
sources. VLBI observations will also be essential to make a characterization of both the ﬁrst AGN
jets, and their dense environments and magnetic ﬁelds.

Tidal disruption events (TDE) of stars in the surroundings of SMBH, as a particular case of
AGN, can also be studied adequately by the same methods as those usually used to study the most
transient class of AGN (i.e. blazars, see Section 3.2).
In particular, it is expected that at least
hundreds of new TDE will be discovered by SKA, which will give the opportunity to trigger multi-
spectral-range campaigns, hopefully also involving multi-frequency polarimetric VLBI. If so, the
ultra-high resolution images provided by VLBI will be essential to characterize the expansion rate
of the newly formed jet (Donnarumma et al. 2015) in the same way as it is routinely done on
extreme ﬂaring events on blazars (e.g. Marscher et al. 2008, 2010; Jorstad et al. 2010, 2013; Agudo
et al. 2011a,b).

5. A collection of desirable SKA-VLBI surveys for radio-loud AGN-jet research

A few preliminary (personal, and therefore perhaps biased) ideas about possible VLBI surveys
and programs to develop with the SKA1 (and its precursors) regarding radio-loud AGN-jet research
are summarized here. But ﬁrst, it is worth mentioning that none of the concept VLBI programs
outlined below will be possible without the information provided by previous wide and/or deep
SKA surveys that are being planned for the key science of SKA1. The main source properties (i.e.
position, extended morphology, radio spectrum, and linear and circular polarization properties) that
will lead to their selection for further follow up studies with ultra-high resolution will come from
previous arcsecond resolution SKA surveys, which are therefore instrumental for any further VLBI
follow up.

9

Radio-loud AGN-jet morphology and polarization: the role of ultra-high resolution radio surveys

As mentioned above, a wide-ﬁeld, targeted, and deep SKA-VLBI survey to discriminate and
identify source classes (i.e. radio AGN vs. SFG) would be the ﬁrst and most direct application of
VLBI observations. For sources at z > 1, SKA-MID alone will not reach angular resolution enough
for this kind of studies, and SKA-VLBI will be essential. SKA-VLBI observations, designed from
previous SKA surveys, will be an instrumental tool to understand and interpret the results of the
ﬁrst SKA continuum surveys. These VLBI observations will be better performed at L-band (1-
2 GHz), which is a classical VLBI band where most radio observatories participating on global
VLBI arrays have available receivers. Polarization sensitivity on these VLBI observations will be
more than useful for source discrimination at no cost in terms of observing time, which is true for
any other VLBI program.

An ultra-deep SKA-VLBI targeted follow up of potential high-redshift (z & 5) sources would
be of top interest to study both the blazar-like early population of radio-loud AGN, and the envi-
ronments of early SMBH through the signature imprinted by their associated GPS-like jets (see
Section 4.2). This observing program could, in principle, be combined on a commensal way, with
the one outlined above for radio AGN vs. SFG discrimination if the observations for high-redshift
sources are planned to be performed as deep as possible. Because of the large redshift nature of
the source populations, observations at the low end of the VLBI frequency window, i.e. the P-band
(300-800 MHz), would be desirable as well. This implies an additional complication for observa-
tions, though, given the restricted number of available stations operating at such low frequencies.
Finally, a target-of-opportunity-like SKA-VLBI monitoring program of transient phenomena
such as TDE and extraordinary blazar ﬂares would be of great interest to explore the still unknown
innermost regions of relativistic jets. These inner regions are those where the jet formation, col-
limation, and acceleration processes still have a relevant inﬂuence on the observable properties
of objects, and therefore their study should shed new light on those processes. Full-polarization
multi-frequency observations with a minimum of 3 well separated frequency bands in the 5 GHz
to 24 GHz range (to allow for high rotation measure studies), and with adequate time sampling for
every kind of event, would be an ideal choice for this kind of program in order to allow for the
highest angular resolutions.

6. Summary and concluding remarks

The relevance of the current challenges on the physics of radio-loud AGN jets (some of them
long-term problems in the ﬁeld) has been shown. Although the advent of the next generation of
radio astronomical facilities (i.e.
the SKA) is already in its path, the addition of an ultra-high
resolution component and the guarantee of very–high–precision full–polarization capabilities will
enhance the science outcome of the SKA. It is anyhow clear that the base of any follow up ultra-
high resolution study should be the information obtained from previous arcsecond resolution SKA
surveys, that will provide the ﬁrst new insights on the current astrophysical problems on radio-loud
AGN. It has been shown how the past and recent VLBI surveys have left a relevant imprint on
our knowledge of the jet phenomenon from SMBH in AGN, and how polarimetric programs have
greatly enhanced such advances. The future is even more promising, once ultra-high sensitivity ob-
servations can be performed with the SKA. Clearly, high precision polarimetry (including circular
polarization), and VLBI observations have a relevant role on the new era of radio astronomy. Both

of them will open new windows for the study of new scenarios. These include both proto-AGN
jet systems at z & 8 and the ﬁrst blazars in the Universe, as well as the study of their evolution
until z ∼ 0 (to be searched through the deepest low frequency VLBI observations). Long standing
problems like the jet formation, collimation, and acceleration processes; and the determination of
the jet composition will also have a relevant advance from multi-(high)frequency full-polarimetric
observations. It has been shown that at the times of SKA, a sensitive VLBI component with good
polarimetric capabilities in the southern hemisphere will be an essential tool. Because of this, it
would be desirable for MeerKat (the precursor of SKA-MID in South Africa) to establish a plan to
add a VLBI component to its collection of observing modes (perhaps based on the AVN concept
plus additions from the EVN) in order to have the opportunity of enjoying the nice capabilities of
ultra-high resolution right from the beginning of its operations.
