ABSTRACT
The assembly of the ﬁrst super massive black holes (SMBHs) at z & 6 is still a subject of in-
tense debate. If black holes (BHs) grow at their Eddington rate, they must start from & 104 M
⊙
seeds formed by the direct collapse of gas. Here we explore the alternative scenario where
BH remnants of the ﬁrst stars grow at super-Eddington rate via radiatively ineﬃ-
∼ 100 M
⊙
cient slim accretion disks. We use an improved version of the cosmological, data-constrained
semi-analytic model GAMETE/QSOdust, where we follow the evolution of nuclear BHs and
gas cooling, disk and bulge formation of their host galaxies. Adopting SDSS J1148+5251
(J1148) at z = 6.4 as a prototype of luminous z & 6 quasars, we ﬁnd that ∼ 80% of its SMBH
mass is grown by super-Eddington accretion, which can be sustained down to z ∼ 10 in dense,
gas-rich environments. The average BH mass at z ∼ 20 is MBH & 104 M
, comparable to
⊙
that of direct collapse BHs. At z = 6.4 the AGN-driven mass outﬂow rate is consistent with
the observations and the BH-to-bulge mass ratio is compatible with the local scaling relation.
However, the stellar mass in the central 2.5 kpc is closer to the value inferred from CO ob-
servations. Finally, ∼ 20% of J1148 progenitors at z = 7.1 have BH luminosities and masses
comparable to ULAS J1120+0641, suggesting that this quasar may be one of the progenitors
of J1148.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-redshift quasars are among the most luminous sources in the
distant Universe. Their large luminosities (L ∼ 1047 erg/s) suggest
that the powering mechanism of the strong radiative emission is
the accretion of gas onto a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH),
with a mass MBH & 109 M
settled in the center of the host galaxy
⊙
(e.g. Fan et al. 2001, 2003; Willott et al. 2007). This phenomenon,
in fact, can convert up to 30% of the energy in radiation, explaining
the nature of this powerful emission (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973).
The most distant quasars are observed up to redshifts z ∼ 7
(Mortlock et al. 2011), corresponding to a Universe younger than 1
Gyr old. How these SMBHs form and grow in such a short time is
still an open question.

In the hierarchical scenario of structure formation, SMBHs are
expected to grow via mergers with other BHs and gas accretion,
starting from a less massive BH, generally referred to as BH seed.
Hence, the formation and accretion history of SMBHs depend on
the initial mass of BH seeds and on their formation epoch. The
nature of the ﬁrst BH seeds is still uncertain and diﬀerent formation

mechanisms have been proposed in the literature (see e.g. Volonteri
2010, and references therein):

(i) primordial black holes, with masses ranging from the Planck
could have formed in the early Universe, well

mass up to 105 M
⊙
before galaxy formation (Khlopov et al. 2005);

(ii) remnants of the ﬁrst generation of metal-poor stars, the
so-called population III (Pop III) stars (see e.g. Bromm 2013
for a review), that can form to black holes of ∼ 100 M
, at
⊙
z ∼ 20 (Madau & Rees 2001; Abel et al. 2002; Bromm et al. 2002;
O’Shea & Norman 2007; Turk et al. 2009; Tanaka & Haiman
2009; Greif et al. 2012; Valiante et al. 2016);

(iii) gas-dynamical processes in massive environment can lead
to the direct collapse of gas into a massive BH of [104 − 106] M
⊙
(Bromm & Loeb 2003; Koushiappas et al. 2004; Begelman et al.
2006; Lodato & Natarajan 2006; Ferrara et al. 2014; Pacucci et al.
2015; Valiante et al. 2016);

(iv) stellar-dynamical processes allow BHs to form in nuclear
clusters of second generation stars with masses ∼ [102 − 105]M
⊙
(Devecchi & Volonteri 2009; Devecchi et al. 2010, 2012);
(v) gas-driven core-collapse of dense stellar clusters due to the
rapid infall of gas with a mass comparable to that of the stellar
cluster can lead to the formation of BHs of ∼ 103 M
or larger

(Davies et al. 2011; Lupi et al. 2014).

Pezzulli et al.

In order to grow up to billion solar masses at z ∼ 6, seed
BHs must accrete gas at the Eddington rate almost uninterruptedly
for several hundreds Myr, even if they start as “heavy seeds” of
[105 − 106] M
. Alternatively, short episodes of super-Eddington
⊙
accretion have been suggested as a viable way to allow the ef-
ﬁcient growth of SMBHs, especially if these start from “light
(Haiman 2004; Yoo & Miralda-Escud´e 2004;
seeds” of ∼ 100 M
⊙
Shapiro 2005; Volonteri & Rees 2005, 2006; Pelupessy et al. 2007;
Tanaka & Haiman 2009; Madau et al. 2014; Volonteri et al. 2015).
In a recent numerical study, Lupi et al. (2015) show that, if a
large reservoir of dense cold gas is available, a MBH ∼ 105 M⊙
can grow in a ∼ Myr timescale starting from a seed mass of
, under the assumption of a slim accretion disk so-
∼ 20 − 100 M
⊙
lution (Abramowicz et al. 1988). The slim disk solution, that we
better describe in Section 2.3, represents an advective, optically
thick ﬂows that generalise the standard Shakura & Sunyaev solu-
tion (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). In this model, the radiative eﬃ-
ciencies, that depend on the accretion rate, are low: the radiation
is trapped and advected inward by the accretion ﬂow (see however
the recent simulations by Sa¸dowski & Narayan 2016). In this sce-
nario, the outﬂow has a negligible eﬀect and the BH can accrete up
to 80% − 100% of the gas mass available (Pacucci et al. 2015).
Indeed, there is observational evidence of mildly super-critical
accretion (Kelly & Shen 2013; Page et al. 2014) in quasars at
redshift up to ∼ 7. In addition, recent numerical simulations
aimed to study super-Eddington accretion onto a rapidly rotat-
ing BH (McKinney et al. 2014) and the energy, momentum and
mass outﬂow rates from radiatively ineﬃcient accretion discs
(Sa¸dowski et al. 2013) predict Eddington ratios ηEdd = L/LEdd up
to 10, where LEdd is the Eddington luminosity, deﬁned as:

LEdd =

4πGMBHmpc

with MBH the central BH mass, mp the proton mass, c the speed
of light and σT the Thomson scattering cross section. Such a high
ratio has been also invoked to explain the nature of ultraluminous
X-ray sources (e.g. Middleton et al. 2013).

In this paper, we investigate the role of super-Eddington ac-
cretion in the formation of the ﬁrst SMBHs at redshift z ∼ 6, with
the aim to understand what are the environments where it can occur
and discuss the implications for the coevolution of the SMBHs and
their host galaxies at high redshifts. We base our analysis on the
data-constrained semi-analytical model GAMETE/QSOdust that
allows to simulate a large number of hierarchical histories of a
quasar host dark matter halo, following the star formation history,
chemical evolution and nuclear black hole growth in all its pro-
genitor galaxies. The model has been ﬁrst successfully used to in-
vestigate the properties of the z = 6.4 quasar SDSS J1148+5251
by Valiante et al. (2011, 2012), applied to a sample of quasars at
5 < z < 6.4 by Valiante et al. (2014) and more recently used to
investigate the relative importance of light and heavy seeds in the
early growth of high-z SMBHs under the assumption of Eddington-
limited accretion (Valiante et al. 2016). Here we present an im-
proved version of the model, that has been modiﬁed to follow gas
cooling, disk and bulge formation, and BH gas accretion in all the
progenitor systems of a z = 6.4 quasar, using SDSS J1148+5251
(hereafter J1148) as a prototype for the general class of luminous
high-redshift quasars.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce
the model, describing assumptions and physical prescriptions. In

Section 3 we present the results. Finally, a discussion and the main
conclusions are given in Section 4.

2 THE MODEL

In this section we provide a brief summary of the original GA-
METE/QSOdust model (referring the readers to Valiante et al.
2011, 2012, 2014 for a more detailed description) and we present
the new features that have been implemented for the present study.
We reconstruct 30 independent merger histories of a dark mat-
ter halo at redshift 6.4 assumed to be the host of J1148. We adopt
a Navarro Frenk & White (1995, NFW) density proﬁle with a mass
of Mh = 1013 M
, within the range supposed to host high-z bright
⊙
quasars (Volonteri & Rees 2006; Fan et al. 2004) and simulate its
hierarchical history using a binary Monte Carlo merger tree algo-
rithm based on the Extended Press-Schechter theory (Lacey & Cole
1993).
The code follows the time evolution of the mass of gas, stars, met-
als and dust in a 2-phase ISM inside each progenitor galaxy (see
also de Bennassuti et al. 2014), taking into account chemical en-
richment from Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and Super-
novae (SNe), which inject dust and metals into the ISM, grain de-
struction by SN shocks and grain growth in dense molecular clouds.
Energy-driven outﬂows, powered by both AGN and SN feedback,
are considered in the model: the energy released by the BH accre-
tion process and SN explosions couples with the gas and can unbind
a huge amount of interstellar gas (Silk & Rees 1998). Although
the physical mechanisms that trigger these galaxy-scale winds are
still controversial, the model predicts mass ejection rates compara-
ble to the observed ones (Maiolino et al. 2012; Valiante et al. 2012;
Cicone et al. 2015).

Following Valiante et al. (2011, 2016) we focus our study on
one of the most distant and best studied quasar, J1148, discovered
at redshift z ≃ 6.4 (Fan et al. 2003). The observationally inferred
properties of this quasar are reported in Table 1. These are used to
calibrate the model by ﬁxing the adjustable free parameters shown
in Table 2, as described below.

In what follows, we discuss the new features of the code,
namely: (a) the formation of the disk via gas cooling; (b) the for-
mation of the bulge via major mergers; (c) bursted and quiescent
star formation both in the disk and in the bulge; (d) the BH seed-
ing prescription; (e) the BH growth via accretion and coalescences,
considering also the recoil velocities that can be generated by the
product of the merging pair due to asymmetric gravitational wave
emission; (f) SNe and AGN feedback, responsible of galactic-scale
winds.

We adopt a Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmol-
ogy with parameters Ωm = 0.314, ΩΛ = 0.686, h = 0.674
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2014), so that the Hubble time at red-
shift 6.4 is 851 Myr. The diﬀerence with the cosmological parame-
ters adopted in previous works (Valiante et al. 2011, 2014) is mainly
the larger value of σ8 (Planck σ8 = 0.834, WMAP7 σ8 = 0.761
), which implies an increased power at small scales, leading to a
larger number of progenitor systems at high redshifts.

2.1 Gas cooling

In each newly virialized dark matter halo with mass Mh, the ini-
tial gas mass is assumed to be the cosmic baryon fraction Mdiﬀ =
(Ωb/Ωm) Mh. We suppose this gas to be all in the diﬀuse phase, i.e.

from the observed ﬂux at 1450 Å (Fan et al. 2003) using the bolometric correction by Richards et al. (2006).

deﬁned as:

ρg(r) =

4πRvirr2 ,

(2)

where Rvir is the virial radius of the dark matter halo. The hot dif-
fuse gas gradually cools providing the reservoir of cold gas out of
which stars form. The gas cooling processes strongly depend on the
temperature and chemical composition of the gas.

In dark matter halos with virial temperature Tvir < 104 K, re-
ferred to as mini-halos, the primordial gas can cool only through
H2 roto-vibrational transitions (Haiman et al. 1996). As the gas
becomes progressively enriched in heavy elements, other molec-
ular species can contribute to cooling and collisionally excited
metal ﬁne-structure lines, mostly OI, CII can provide additional
cooling pathways. Here we only consider the contribution of H2,
OI and CII cooling using metallicity dependent tabulated cool-
ing functions, Λ(Tvir, Z), computed as described in Appendix A
of Valiante et al. (2016) but we neglect the eﬀect of H2 photo-
dissociation by Lyman-Werner photons. We will return to this point
in Section 3.

In dark matter halos with virial temperatures Tvir ≥ 104K,
referred to as Lyman-α cooling halos, the temperature is high
enough to excite atomic transitions, allowing the primordial gas to
cool through hydrogen Lyman-α line emission. In this regime, we
use metallicity-dependent tabulated cooling functions presented by
Sutherland & Dopita (1993).

The time scale for gas cooling, τcool, is deﬁned as:

τcool =

2

µmpκBTvir

ρg(rcool)Λ(Tvir, Z)

,

(3)

where κB is the Boltzmann constant, µ is the mean molecular
weight and rcool is the cooling radius and it is obtained by assuming
that the cooling time is equal to the halo dynamical time tdyn =
Rvir/vDM, where vDM is the dark matter (DM) halo circular velocity:

vir #1/2
rcool = " tdyn Mdiﬀ Λ(Tvir, Z)

6π µmp κBTvir R2

.

Then, the gas cooling rate can be computed1 as:

˙Mcool = 4πρg(rcool)r2

1 Note that if rcool > Rvir we assume that the gas never reaches hydrostatic
equilibrium and it is immediately available to star formation (De Lucia et al.
2010).

2.2 Disk and bulge formation

Along the hierarchical history of the ﬁnal DM halo, we deﬁne ma-
jor (minor) halo-halo merger events as those with halo mass ra-
tio µ = Mhalo,1/Mhalo,2 (with Mhalo,1 ≤ Mhalo,2) larger (lower) than
µthr = 1/4 (Barausse 2012). In quiescent evolution (i.e. no en-
counters with other galaxies), the cold gas settles on a rotationally-
supported disk, because of the conservation of angular momentum,
and can start to form stars. The disk, composed of gas and stars, can
be disrupted by a major merger and a spherical bulge is expected
to form in this event. Minor mergers, instead, are not expected to
destroy the disk but may help the growth of the bulge by disk insta-
bilities (Naab & Burkert 2003; Bournaud et al. 2005).

In our model, major mergers are supposed to destroy both the
gaseous and stellar disk components of the newly-formed galaxy,
adding the stars and gas to the central bulge. Minor mergers do
not contribute to the transfer of matter between the disk and bulge,
and thus lead to the formation of a new galaxy with disk and bulge
masses that are the sum of the two progenitors ones.

We consider a self-gravitating disk, with an exponential gas

surface density proﬁle, Σd, deﬁned as (Mo et al. 1998):

Σd(r) = Σd(0) e−r/Rd ,

(6)

where Rd is the scale radius of the gaseous disk and Σd(0) is the
central surface densities of the gas. For the stellar component of the
disk, we adopt the same density proﬁle with the same scale radius
Rd. Following Mo et al. (1998) we deﬁne the scale radius as,

Rd =

1

√2   jd

md! λRvir

1

p fc

fR(λ, c, md, jd),

(7)

where jd = Jd/J is the ratio between the disk angular momentum
and that of the halo, md = Md/Mh is the disk mass (stars+gas)
fraction over the halo mass. From the conservation of the speciﬁc
angular momentum we assume jd/md = 1. The spin parameter λ is
considered to be constant and equal to 0.05, the mean value adopted
by Mo et al. (1998).

The factors fc and fR take into account the correction to the
total energy of the halo resulting from the NFW density proﬁle and
the gravitational eﬀect of the disk, and are computed following the
prescription given by Mo et al. (1998). The factor fc depends on the
concentration parameter c, that we assume to be constant and equal
to c = 12:

2 Unfortunately, numerical studies of the concentration parameter of dark
matter halos spanning the mass and redshift range relevant for the present
study are not available. Extrapolating the results of Mu˜noz-Cuartas et al.
(2011), we adopt a constant value of c = 1. At a ﬁxed halo mass, BH growth
would be favoured in more concentrated halos, that are characterized by a
larger mass and circular velocity in the inner regions (Mo et al. 1998).

ﬁrst and second type, respectively and Σ0 = Σ(0)d + Σ(0)⋆
d is the
sum of the gas and stellar central (r = 0) surface densities.

For the bulge component, we assume that the gas density pro-

ﬁle ρb(r) is described as (Hernquist 1990),

ρb(r) =

rb

r(r + rb)3 ,

(12)

where the scale radius, rb, is computed as rb = Reﬀ/1.8153 (Hern-
3, depends on the gas and
quist 1990), and the eﬀective radius Reﬀ
stellar masses in the bulge (Shen et al. 2003):

log(Reﬀ/kpc) = 0.56 log(Mb + M⋆

b ) − 5.54.

(13)

We adopt the same density proﬁle for the stellar component in the
bulge.

The velocity proﬁle of the bulge, computed through the Pois-

son equation is

v2
b =

Gr(Mb + M⋆
b )

(rb + r)2

.

(14)

We assume that the halo responds adiabatically to the gradual build
up of the disk and bulge, maintaining the spherical symmetry dur-
ing the contraction. Thus, the angular momentum is conserved dur-
ing the collapse from a mean initial radius ri to a radius r (< ri), so
that:

M f (r)r = M(ri)ri,

(15)

where M(ri) is the mass of DM enclosed in ri obtained integrating
the NFW density proﬁle and M f (r) is the total ﬁnal mass within a
radius r:

M f (r) = Md,t(r) + Mb,t(r) + (1 − fgal)M(ri),

(16)

where Md,t(r) and Mb,t(r) are the total disk and bulge masses (star
and gas) enclosed within a radius r, obtained by integrating eqs. (6)
and (12), and fgal = [Md,t + Mb,t]/Mh is the fraction of the total mass
in the disk and bulge.

The velocity curve of the perturbed DM halo is then,

(17)

Following these prescriptions we model the formation and evolu-
tion of disk and bulge components in each halo along the recon-
structed merger histories.

2.2.1 Star formation rate

Hydrodynamical simulations suggest that merging events, major
mergers in particular, can trigger bursts of star formation in the
central regions as a consequence of the tidal forces produced
by galaxy-galaxy interactions (Mihos & Hernquist 1994; Springel
2000; Cox et al. 2008).

Since starbursts are conﬁned in the very central region of the
galaxy, we assume a quiescent mode of star formation in the disk
while bursts are triggered in the bulge when a major merger occurs.
The star formation rate (SFR) in the disk is described as,

˙M⋆

d = ǫ⋆
d

Md,
τd

(18)

where Md is the gas mass in the disk, τd = 3Rd/vc(3Rd) is the
dynamical time of the disk evaluated at the peak of the circular
velocity proﬁle (Mo et al. 1998), Rd is the disk scale radius deﬁned
in eq. 7 and ǫ⋆
d is an adjustable free parameter representing the star
d = 0.083
formation eﬃciency in the disk. In our reference model, ǫ⋆
(see Table 2).

Similarly, the SFR in the bulge is computed as,

˙M⋆

b = ǫ⋆
b

Mb
τb

,

(19)

where Mb is the gas mass in the bulge, τb = Reﬀ /vc(Reﬀ) is the dy-
namical time of the bulge and the eﬀective radius Reﬀ is deﬁned
in eq. 13 above. We assume that in absence of merger events, the
star formation eﬃciency in the bulge is equal to that of the disk,
d . When a merger event occurs, the star formation eﬃciency
ǫ⋆
b = ǫ⋆
increases as a consequence of the destabilizing eﬀect of the inter-
action, and we adopt the following scaling relation:

b = ǫ⋆
ǫ⋆

d f (µ),

(20)

with f (µ) = max[1, 1 + 2.5 (µ − 0.1)], so that mergers with µ ≤ 0.1
do not trigger starbursts. With the adopted scaling relation, the star-
b ≤ 0.27, con-
burst eﬃciency in the reference model is 0.083 ≤ ǫ⋆
sistent with the range of values found by means of hydrodynamical
simulations of merging galaxy pairs (Cox et al. 2008) and adopted
by other studies (Menci et al. 2004; Valiante et al. 2011).

2.3 Black hole growth and feedback

2.3.1 BH seeds

We assume BH seeds to form only as remnants of ﬁrst (Pop III)
stars. In fact, our main aim is to investigate if SMBHs can form by
super-Eddington accretion starting from “light” seeds at high red-
shift. Although the initial mass function of Pop III stars is still very
uncertain, the most recent numerical simulations suggest a char-
acteristic mass of a few hundreds of solar masses at z ∼ 25, that
progressively shifts to a few tens of solar masses at lower redshifts
(Hirano et al. 2015). For simplicity, here we do not consider the
redshift modulation of the characteristic mass and we plant a BH
seed with a mass of Mseed = 100 M
in each newly-virialized halo
⊙
with a metallicity Z < Zcr = 10−4Z
, above which the eﬀects of dust
and metal line cooling allow the gas to fragment, reducing the char-
acteristic mass to values comparable to those found in local stel-
lar populations (Schneider et al. 2002, 2003, 2012; Omukai et al.
2005).

2.3.2 BH accretion

Once formed, the BH accretes gas from the surrounding medium.
The correlation between the mass of central SMBH and the bulge
mass or velocity dispersion (Magorrian et al. 1998; Richstone et al.
1998, see Kormendy & Ho 2013 and references therein) and the
small scale on which the accretion takes place, suggest that the ac-
cretion onto the central black hole should be fuelled by the cold gas
present in the bulge.

The collapse of material onto the central BH in a galaxy is trig-
gered by both merger-driven infall of cold gas, which loses angular
momentum due to galaxy encounters, and quiescent accretion, as-
suming that the accretion rate is proportional to the cold gas mass
in the bulge,

˙Maccr =

faccr Mb

τb

,

(21)

where, similarly to eq. (20), the accretion eﬃciency is expressed as,

faccr = β f (µ),

(22)

where β is an adjustable free parameter. In our reference model,
β = 0.03 (see Table 2), so that the eﬃciency of BH accretion is
about ∼ 1/3 of the eﬃciency of star formation in the bulge.

Thus, the mass growth rate is,

˙MBH = (1 − ǫr) ˙Maccr,
where the radiative eﬃciency ǫr is deﬁned as,

ǫr =

Lbol

˙Maccr c2

,

(23)

(24)

with Lbol being the bolometric luminosity emitted by the accretion
process. At high accretion rates, the Shakura & Sunyaev (1973)
model of BH growth through a thin disk, where all the heat gen-
erated by viscosity is immediately radiated away, is incorrect.
Instead, it is possible to use the optically thick, slim accretion
disk solution, that is characterized by low radiative eﬃciencies
(Abramowicz et al. 1988).
The bolometric luminosity, Lbol, is computed starting from the

where the Eddington accretion rate is deﬁned as ˙MEdd ≡ 16 LEdd/c2
and A(a), B(a) and C(a) are functions of the BH spin parameter a,

A(a) = (0.9663 − 0.9292a)−0.5639,
B(a) = (4.627 − 4.445a)−0.5524,
C(a) = (827.3 − 718.1a)−0.7060.

(26)
(27)
(28)

The slim accretion disk model represented by eq. (25) predicts
that even when the accretion rate is super-Eddington, with 1 .
˙Maccr/ ˙MEdd . 100, the disk luminosity remains only mildy super-
Eddington, with Lbol . (2 − 4) LEdd. In fact, in this regime a large
fraction of the energy generated by viscosity does not have the time
to be radiated away and is instead advected into the black hole. As a
result, the radiative eﬃciency is very small, with 0.002 . ǫr . 0.05,
almost independently of the value of the BH spin parameter (see
Figure 1 in Madau et al. 2014. Conversely, when the accretion rate
is sub-Eddington, the radiative eﬃciency increases reaching an al-
most constant value which depends on the BH spin, as in the stan-
dard think disk solution, with ǫr . 0.05 for a = 0 and ǫr . 0.3 for
a = 0.98.

Here we do not describe the time evolution of the BH
spin parameter and we simply assume that the module of the
spin vector a is randomly extracted from a uniform distribution
(Tanaka & Haiman 2009; Barausse 2012).

2.3.3 BH mergers

In halo merging events, we assume that the two nuclear BHs coa-
lesce with the same timescale of their host halos. However, in minor
mergers (with µ < µthr = 1/4, see Section 2.2) only the largest of
the two progenitors BHs can settle in the centre of the new halo po-
tential well, surviving as a nuclear BH, while the smaller one ends
up as a satellite.

During the BH merger, the newly formed BH receives a large
center-of-mass recoil due to the net linear momentum carried by the
asymmetric gravitational waves emission (Campanelli et al. 2007;
Schnittman et al. 2008; Baker et al. 2008). The recoil (or kick) ve-
locity of the coalesced binary depends on the mass ratio of the
merging pair and on the amplitude and orientation of the spin
vectors of the two BHs. Here we follow the parametrization pre-
sented by Tanaka & Haiman (2009) and - for each merger event -
we compute the kick velocity as a function of the BH mass ratio
assuming the spin vectors to be randomly oriented. The average
kick velocities increase with the mass ratio of the merging pair,
q = MBH,1/MBH,2 (with MBH,1 ≤ MBH,2). For strongly unequal mass
mergers, with 0.01 . q . 0.1, we ﬁnd hvkicki = 1 − 100 km/s,
whereas for larger mass ratios, with 0.1 . q . 1, the kicks can be
very strong, with velocities hvkicki = 100 − 1000 km/s.
We then compare the kick velocity with the circular veloc-
ity at the radius of inﬂuence of the BH, RBH = GMBH/v2
c(RBH)
with vc(r) given by eq. (10), and we retain the BH only when
vkick < vc(RBH). For MBH/Mh = 10−3, the retention velocity is
vc(RBH) ∼ 2vvir, where vvir is the escape velocity at the virial ra-
dius (Yoo & Miralda-Escud´e 2004).

2.3.4 BH feedback

There is now strong observational evidence that the energy released
by the quasar can drive powerful galaxy-scale outﬂows (for recent
works see Feruglio et al. 2015; Carniani et al. 2015; Cresci et al.
2015 and references therein). Outﬂowing gas at velocities up to
v ∼ 1400 km/s traced by [CII] emission has been detected in SDSS
J1148 (Maiolino et al. 2012) with an estimated total mass outﬂow
⊙/yr that decreases with distance from the
rate of 1400 ± 300 M
quasar, ranging from a peak value of ∼ 500 M
⊙/yr at ∼ 3 kpc to
. 100 M
⊙/yr at ∼ 20 kpc (Cicone et al. 2015).
In Valiante et al. (2012) we show that the quasar-driven mass
outﬂow rate predicted by GAMETE/QSOdust, on the basis of a
simple energy-driven wind, is in good agreement with the obser-
vations. Here we follow a similar approach, adopting the so-called
blast wave model, in which the AGN radiation ﬁeld can acceler-
ate the gas generating fast supersonic winds which propagates out-
wards through an expanding blast wave, pushing out the surround-
ing medium (see e.g. Cavaliere et al. 2002; King 2003, 2005, 2010;
Lapi et al. 2005; Menci et al. 2005, 2008; Zubovas & King 2012,
2014; Costa et al. 2014 and references therein).

In this framework, the energy released by the AGN that cou-

ples with the interstellar gas is estimated as,

˙EAGN = ǫAGN ǫr ˙Maccrc2,

(29)

where the coupling eﬃciency ǫAGN is an adjustable free parameter.
In our reference model ǫAGN = 1.5 × 10−3 (see Table 2).
If the post shock material does not cool eﬃciently, the bubble
expands adiabatically and the outﬂow is energy-driven. As the blast
wave propagates from the center of the halo, it ﬁrst interacts with
the gas of the disk and bulge, reheating a fraction of cold gas and
transferring mass to the diﬀuse hot phase.

When the shock has propagated beyond the bulge and disk
radius, part of the gas mass is ejected from the galaxy, if the binding
energy is not enough to hold the material.

The mass outﬂow rate at a given radius r can be estimated as:

˙Mw,AGN(r) = 2 ǫAGN ǫr   c

vc(r)!2

˙Maccr,

(30)

where vc is the circular velocity of the system given by eq. (10),
and we evaluate the above equation at the bulge, disk and DM halo
virial radius.

A similar description is used to describe the eﬀects of SN-
driven winds. The mass outﬂow rate beyond a given radius r is
given by:

˙Mw,SN(r) =

2 ǫSN ESN
vc(r)2 RSN

(31)

where RSN is the rate of SN explosions, ESN is the average SN ex-
plosion energy, and ǫSN = 1.6 × 10−3 is the SN wind eﬃciency
(Valiante et al. 2012). The time-dependent SN rate and explosion
energy is computed for each galaxy along the merger tree accord-
ing to formation rate, age and initial mass function of its stellar
population. A detailed description of the chemical evolution model
can be found in Valiante et al. (2011, 2014) and de Bennassuti et al.
(2014).

3 RESULTS

In this section, we present the predicted evolution of the hierar-
chical assembly of the SMBH and its host galaxy. To explore the

dependence of the results on the population of progenitors and their
merger rate, for the same model parameters we have run 30 inde-
pendent merger trees. In one merger tree we ﬁnd that a merger oc-
curs at z = 6.43 between two black holes of M1,BH = 1.7 × 109M
⊙
and M2,BH = 1.6 × 109 M
, producing a recoil velocity ∼ 2 times
⊙
higher than the retention speed, vc(RBH). The newly formed BH is
displaced from the center and it stops accreting gas. For this reason,
we do not consider this to be a viable formation route for a bright
quasar like J1148, and we exclude this merger tree from the sample
average.

3.1 The formation of stars and BH seeds

⊙ = 10.84 × 109 SFR/(M

In Fig. 1, we show the redshift evolution of the total SFR (summed
over all the progenitor galaxies in each simulation) and the separate
contribution of Pop III stars. We also show the upper limit on the
⊙/yr (Table 1) inferred from the observed FIR lu-
SFR of ∼ 2000 M
minosity using the relation LFIR/L
⊙/yr)
(Valiante et al. 2014). This relation4 is based on the assumption
of starburst dominated dust heating and it provides only an upper
limit to the real SFR, due to the non-negligible contribution from
the AGN. According to a recent detailed radiative transfer analy-
sis, the AGN can provide up to 60% of the total FIR luminosity
(Schneider et al. 2015), decreasing the SFR by a factor 1.4 - 2.5, in
agreement with the average value of ∼ 800 M
⊙/yr predicted by the
reference model.
Due to eﬃcient metal enrichment, Pop III star formation
becomes negligible below z ∼ 20 and no more BH seeds
are formed, consistent with other studies (Madau & Rees 2001;
Haiman & Loeb 2001; Heger et al. 2003; Volonteri et al. 2003;

4 The conversion factor between the FIR luminosity and the SFR has been
obtained assuming a 10 - 200 Myr burst of stars with solar metallicity and
a Larson IMF with mch = 0.35M⊙ (Valiante et al. 2014).

⊙/yr . BHAR . 10−3 M

BHAR predicted by the reference model, in the bottom panels of
Fig. 3 we also show the mean quantities, averaged over all BH pro-
genitors present at each redshift in each simulation. It is clear that
at 20 . z . 25 the mean BH mass rapidly grows from ∼ 100 M
⊙
to ∼ 104 M
by means of super-Eddington gas accretion rates of
⊙
10−5M
⊙/yr. Hence, due to early eﬃcient
super-Eddington accretion, the mean BH progenitors at z ∼ 20 have
already achieved a mass comparable to the BH mass predicted by
the direct collapse scenario. This is consistent with what recently
found by Lupi et al. (2015) by means of high-resolution numerical
simulations, which show that stellar-mass black holes can increase
their mass by 3 orders of magnitudes within a few million years
while accreting gas at super-Eddington rates in the dense cores of
high-z galaxies.

Fig. 4 shows the average distribution of BHs accreting at
super- and sub-Eddington rates as a function of the BH mass and
Eddington accretion ratio for diﬀerent redshift intervals. The ref-
erence model predicts that, at 15 ≤ z ≤ 25, almost all BH pro-
genitors accrete at super-Eddington rates. Since the BH masses are
still relatively small, 102 M

respond to very large accretion ratios,
The mass of BH progenitors increases with time and the frac-
tional number of super-Eddington accreting BHs decreases, being
fs ∼ 60% at z ∼ 10 − 15 and dropping to fs ∼ 20% at z < 10.
Because of the larger BH masses, the accretion ratios are smaller
and ˙Maccr/ ˙MEdd < 500 at z < 10.

⊙ ≤ MBH ≤ 106 M
⊙

For most of the evolution, we ﬁnd that BH progenitors ac-
crete at highly super-Eddington rates, with ˙Maccr/ ˙MEdd >> 10.
At these large Eddington accretion ratios the applicability of the
adopted slim disk solution is highly debated. In fact, recent general-
relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations show that BHs
accreting at 20 < ˙Maccr/ ˙MEdd < 200 develop a disk structure that
is still radiatively ineﬃcient, with total luminosities that do not ex-
ceed ∼ 10 LEdd, but the total energy escaping the system can be very
large, mostly in the form of thermal and kinetic energy of outﬂow-
ing gas and Poyinting ﬂux (McKinney et al. 2014; Sa¸dowski et al.
2013). However, Inayoshi et al. (2015) have shown that there ex-
ist regimes where steady accretion rates larger than 3000 times the
Eddington rate can be sustained.

To better assess the impact of these extreme hyper-Eddington
accretion events on our results, we have run the same set of simu-
lations discussed so far but artiﬁcially imposing an upper limit of
˙Maccr ≤ 20 ˙MEdd = 320 LEdd/c2 to the gas accretion rate. The results
are shown in Fig. 5. In the same ﬁgure, we also show, for compari-
son, the evolution predicted assuming Eddington-limited accretion.
In order to better compare with previous results, this model has
been run assuming ˙Maccr ≤ LEdd/c2 (1/16 smaller than the deﬁ-
nition adopted in the present study, see Eq. 25), as conventionally
adopted in the literature.

We ﬁnd that, even when the Eddington accretion ratio is
˙Maccr/ ˙MEdd ≤ 20, the ﬁnal SMBH mass predicted by the refer-
ence model is in good agreement with the observations. The high-
redshift evolution of both the total BH mass and the total BHAR,
however, is markedly diﬀerent from the results shown in Fig. 3. At
z > 10 the BHAR is several orders of magnitudes smaller and the
BH mass is correspondingly aﬀected, being ∼ 106 M
at z ∼ 15
⊙
(∼ 1/100 of the total BH mass shown in Fig. 3 at the same z). Due
to the smaller gas accretion rates at high redshifts, a larger gas frac-
tion is retained around nuclear BHs at z < 10. As a result, the BH

we ﬁnd that a major fraction (∼ 90%, on average) of BH seeds are
formed in DM mini-halos, where gas cooling could be easily sup-
pressed due to H2 photo-dissociation by Lyman-Werner photons.
The inclusion of this additional feedback eﬀect slows down metal
enrichment and extends BH seeds formation to lower redshifts
(z ≥ 15) and larger DM halos (∼ 5 × 107 − 109 M
). While the evo-
⊙
lution of the total BH mass and BH accretion rate at z < 15 is only
mildly aﬀected, the birth environment of late-forming seed BHs
(gas rich Ly-α cooling halos) may be more favorable to SE accre-
tion. Here we do not consider the eﬀect of H2 photo-dissociation,
which we defer to a future study, and we assume that the formation
rate of Pop III stars is limited only by metal enrichment.

3.2 BH evolution

In Fig. 3 we show the redshift evolution of the BH mass and black
hole accretion rate (BHAR) predicted by our reference model. In
the top panels, the values are obtained summing over all BH pro-
genitors present at each redshift in each simulation and then av-
eraged over the 29 realizations. The diﬀerent lines allow to sepa-
rate the contribution to the BH mass and accretion rate achieved
by means of sub-Eddington (≤ 16 LEdd/c2) and super-Eddington
(> 16 LEdd/c2) accretion events. By construction, the ﬁnal BH mass
predicted by the reference model is ∼ (3.6 ± 1.6) × 109 M
, in
⊙
agreement with the value inferred from observations of J1148 (see
Table 1). We ﬁnd that, on average, ∼ 75% of the ﬁnal SMBH
mass grows by means of super-Eddington gas accretion. This pro-
vides the dominant contribution to the total BHAR at all but the
smallest redshifts. Although the quantities shown in all panels have
been averaged over 29 merger trees, the redshift evolution of the
BHAR appears to be very intermittent, a consequence of rapid de-
pletion/replenishment of the bulge gas reservoir out of which the
BHs accrete.

To gain a better idea of the typical values of BH mass and

mass has a steeper late growth rate, with short episodes of intense
gas accretion reaching ∼ 102 M

⊙/yr at z ∼ 7.

On the contrary, when Eddington-limited gas accretion is as-
sumed, the ﬁnal BH mass can no longer be reproduced using the
reference model. In this case, the gas accretion rates are too small to
trigger fast BH growth at high redshifts. The total BH mass is dom-

inated by the coalescence of BH seeds and its redshift evolution is
strongly aﬀected by lack of BH seeds at z < 20 (see the behaviour
of the Pop III SFR in Fig. 1) and by kicks received during BH-BH
coalescences in major mergers. Fig. 6 shows the evolution of the
average number of major mergers and of kicked BHs predicted by
the model. While the average number of major mergers decreases

with time, the number of kicked BHs increases at 20 . z . 25
and than decreases at lower z. This is due to the combination of the
growing number of BH seeds formed at high z and of the shallow
potetial wells of their host mini-halos, which allow the kick veloc-
ity of the newly formed BH to easily exceed the retention speed.

Hence, we can conclude that super-Eddington accretion is fun-
damental for the formation of the ﬁrst SMBHs at z > 6, even when
extreme hyper-Eddington accretion events are not considered.

3.3 Environmental conditions for Super-Eddington accretion

Our model enables us to perform a statistical study of the physi-
cal properties of the environments where BH progenitors accrete
at super-Eddington rates. The left panel of Fig. 4 shows that when
both sub- and super-Eddington accreting BHs are present, their BH
masses are comparable, with a tendency of sub-Eddington accret-
ing BHs to have larger masses at lower z. Similarly, the occurrence
of super-Eddington accretion is not correlated with the mass of the
host dark matter halo, nor with its gas content or metallicity. At
each given value of any of these quantities, in fact, both sub- and
super-Eddington accreting BHs are found in the simulations.

The diﬀerent accretion regimes are more cleanly separated
when we plot the Eddington gas accretion ratio as a function of
the ratio between the gaseous bulge and the BH masses (see the
left panel of Fig. 7). Most of the BHs that accrete at sub-Eddington
rates are characterized by Mb/MBH < 20, whereas the number of
super-Eddington accreting BHs is negligible when Mb/MBH < 0.1.
However, when 0.1 ≤ Mb/MBH ≤ 20 (the region between the two
vertical lines in the plot), the BHs can be characterized by vastly
diﬀerent accretion ratios: a good fraction of the hyper-Eddington
accreting BHs are found in this region of the plot. The larger ac-
cretion rate in these systems is due to the much shorter dynamical
time of the bulge. This is shown in the right panel of Fig. 7. A se-

quence of increasing bulge dynamical times is evident, with most
of the BHs found in bulges with 0.01 Myr . τb < 1 Myr in hyper-
Eddington, 0.1 Myr . τb < 20 Myr in mildly super-Eddington, and
5 Myr . τb < 20 Myr in sub-Eddington accretion regimes. Indeed,
hyper-Eddington accreting BHs are predominantly found in high-z
systems, with less massive and more compact bulges. The ﬁgure
also shows that super-Eddington accretion requires gas-rich bulges
and that, when Mb/MBH < 0.1, only sub-Eddington accreting BHs
in massive, gas poor bulges are found.

The environmental conditions for super-Eddington accretion
that emerge from our statistical study are in good agreement with
the results recently found by Lupi et al. (2015). By means of de-
tailed hydro-dynamical simulations, these authors show that, in or-
der to accrete at super-Eddington rates, BHs must be embedded
in dense gas structures, with masses comparable or larger than the
masses of the accreting BHs.

3.4 BH-driven outﬂow

Outﬂowing cold gas in J1148, traced by [C II] emission, was ﬁrst
detected by Maiolino et al. (2012) with the IRAM Plateau de Bure
Interferometer, and then conﬁrmed with high-resolution follow-up
observations by Cicone et al. (2015). The outﬂow has a complex
morphology and spatial extent, reaching a maximum projected ra-
dius of 30 kpc. The estimated mass outﬂow rate and velocity are
shown in Fig. 8 as a function of the projected distance from the nu-
cleus. In the same ﬁgure, we also show the predictions of the refer-
ence model. Following eq. (30), the outﬂow velocity is computed as
the circular velocity at the corresponding radius, vw,AGN(r) = vc(r),
and we estimate the mass outﬂow rate accounting for the delay
τdyn = r/vw,AGN between the BH energy release and the observa-
tion. Due to the large variability of the BH luminosity, the 1-σ dis-
persion among the diﬀerent merger trees of the predicted average
mass outﬂow rate (gray shaded region in the upper panel) is con-

sistent with the data. However, the average values (black solid line)
are larger than observed and show a diﬀerent radial dependence,
especially at r > 20 kpc. The bottom panel shows that the observed
outﬂow travels at a velocity consistent with the circular velocity of
the host system. There are a few radii where the observed values
are larger, probably reﬂecting a stronger coupling between the en-
ergy and momentum injected by the AGN and the surrounding gas.
Yet, even if we take the observed values of outﬂow velocities at
each radius to estimate τdyn and ˙Mw,AGN (see the blue dashed line
in the upper panel with the cyan shaded region), the resulting mean
mass outﬂow rate is still larger than observed. Our description of
an energy-driven wind with constant coupling eﬃciency may not
be adequate to capture the complex dynamics of this massive out-
ﬂow. However, Cicone et al. (2015) stress that the data should be
considered as a lower limit on the total mass outﬂow rate, because
it accounts only for the atomic gas phase of the outﬂow, while a
signiﬁcant amount of the outﬂowing mass may be in the molecular
phase.

3.5 The coevolution of BHs and their host galaxies

It is interesting to explore the implications of our results for the
co-evolution of nuclear BHs and their host galaxies. In Fig. 9 we
show the evolutionary path (from the bottom left to the top right)
in the mean BH mass - stellar bulge mass (hmBHi - hm⋆
b i) plane pre-
dicted by the reference model (black solid line) and by the model
with ˙Maccr ≤ 20 ˙MEdd (orange solid line). In each simulation, we
consider the mean values among all the SMBH progenitors and
their hosts present at each redshift, and then we average over the
29 merger trees. For comparison, we also show in the same ﬁg-
ure the observational data and the empirical ﬁt (gray data points
and dashed line) for local galaxies provided by Sani et al. (2011),
and the more recent scaling relation inferred for local ellipticals

Figure 8. The mass outﬂow rate (upper panel) and velocity (lower panel) as

observations are shown with red data points and the predictions of the ref-
erence model are shown by black solid lines with shaded gray regions. The
blue dashed line in the upper panel (with the cyan dashed region) shows
the predicted outﬂow rate that we would infer using the BH luminosity pre-
dicted by the reference model and the observed outﬂow velocities (see text).

the diﬀerent evolution at high-z is reﬂected in a steeper relation
between the mean BH mass and the stellar bulge, very close to
that predicted by Kormendy & Ho (2013). The diﬀerence between

When the average BH mass has reached its value of (3.6 ±
1.6) × 109 M
at z = 6.4, the host galaxy has already grown
⊙
to a bulge (total) stellar mass of 2.7 (3.2) × 1011 M
. Hence, we
⊙
predict a ﬁnal average BH-to-bulge (total) stellar mass ratio of
MBH/Mstar = 0.013 (0.011), well within the scatter of the rela-
tions inferred from various observational studies of massive local
galaxies (Marconi & Hunt 2003; Sani et al. 2011; Kormendy & Ho
2013, and references therein). However, this ratio is ∼ 25 times
smaller than what is inferred from observations of J1148 (red
data point). Following the procedure commonly applied to high-
z bright QSOs, the stellar mass is computed as Mstar = Mdyn − MH2,
with Mdyn and MH2 inferred from CO observations (see Table 1,
Walter et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2010). Similar results obtained for
a larger sample of z > 6 QSOs have suggested the idea that the
ﬁrst SMBHs grow faster than their host galaxies (Wang et al. 2010,
2013; Venemans et al. 2015 see however Willott et al. 2015).

As suggested by Valiante et al. (2014), observations of high-z
QSOs are sensitive to the innermost 2.5 − 3 kpc and may be miss-
ing a signiﬁcant fraction of the galaxy (Valiante et al. 2014). This
is also supported by recent observations of J1148, which show ex-
tended [C II] 158 µm emission and far-infrared (FIR) continuum,
likely associated with cold gas and star formation on scales of
∼ 10 − 20 kpc (Cicone et al. 2015).
Indeed, the mean bulge eﬀective radius at z = 6.4 predicted
by the model is Reﬀ = 7.3 ± 0.8 kpc, in good agreement with ob-
servations of local galaxies hosting the largest BHs (see Fig. 10).
When we restrict to the innermost 2.5 kpc, we ﬁnd a mean bulge
stellar mass of (3.9± 0.2)× 1010 M
, much closer to the observation
⊙
(see the arrow and black data point in Fig. 9). The same is true if
we consider the mean gas mass within 2.5 kpc, that we predict to
be MH2 = (2.0 ± 0.9) × 1010 M
, that well reproduce the observed
⊙
value (see Table 1).

Finally, the reference model predicts a mean dust mass at
z = 6.4 of Mdust = (3.6 ± 0.9) × 108 M
, in good agreement
⊙
with the value inferred from the FIR luminosity. This result has
been obtained using the chemical evolution module, which includes
dust processing in a 2-phase ISM, that has been developed by
Valiante et al. (2011, 2014) and de Bennassuti et al. (2014). Hence,
consistent with previous ﬁndings (Valiante et al. 2011, 2014), we
ﬁnd that the large dust mass that has enriched the ISM of the host
galaxy is the result of a large stellar component, and that the ap-
parent tension with the observed dynamical mass - the so-called
stellar mass crisis - is at least partly due to the small spatial extent
of the observations. We refer the interested readers to Valiante et al.
(2014) for an extended discussion on this point.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The data-constrained model GAMETE/QSOdust allows us to ex-
plore a large number of formation histories of a given quasar, in
the present case J1148 at z = 6.4, reproducing the observations
of the quasar and its host galaxy. With the adjustable free param-
eters that we have selected, described in Table 2, the model repro-
duces the physical quantities listed in Table 1. Hence, the properties
that we predict for the host galaxy of J1148 (SFR, dust mass, gas

and stellar masses) are consistent with previous results obtained by
(Valiante et al. 2014, 2016) for the same quasar.

With respect to (Valiante et al. 2011, 2014, 2016), the current
version of GAMETE/QSOdust enables to (i) follow the formation
and evolution of the disk and bulge in each progenitor galaxy, and
(ii) remove the constraint of Eddington-limited BH accretion.

In particular, Valiante et al. (2016) ﬁnd that the formation of
a few (between 3 and 30 in the reference model) heavy BH seeds
with masses MBH = 105 M
enables the Eddington-limited growth
⊙
of a SMBH by z = 6.4. This conclusion heavily depends on the
occurrence - among the progenitors - of Lyman-α cooling halos
where gas cooling is suppressed by the low-metallicity and strong
Lyman-Werner background (Valiante et al. 2016). This “head start”
requires favourable conditions, that are easily erased by the joint
interplay of chemical, radiative and mechanical feedback eﬀects.

Here we have explored the alternative scenario where the
BHs can grow through a radiatively ineﬃcient slim disk at super-
Eddington rates. This condition is easily met by light BH seeds
formed in gas-rich systems at high redshifts.

In the model presented in this work, we plant light BH seeds
in newly virialized halos above redshift z ∼ 20, before the eﬀects
of chemical feedback inhibit the formation of metal poor (Z < Zcr)
stars. With this seeding prescription, we ﬁnd that:

• On average, ∼ 80% of the SMBH mass of J1148 is provided
by super-Eddington gas accretion (> 16 LEdd/c2). This represents
the dominant contribution to BH growth down to z ∼ 10;
mass at redshift z ∼ 20 is & 104 M
⊙
heavy BH seeds formed by direct collapse;

• Due to fast and eﬃcient super-critical accretion, the mean BH
, comparable that predicted for

• More than 90% of BH progenitors accrete at super-Eddington
rates at 15 < z < 25 in dense, gas-rich environments. At these
redshifts, hyper-Eddington accretion events, with ˙Maccr/ ˙MEdd ∼
102 − 104, are common;
• The observed SMBH mass of J1148 at z = 6.4 can be repro-
duced even adopting a maximum super-Eddington accretion rate of
˙Maccr ≤ 20 ˙MEdd, showing that hyper-critical accretion is not re-
quired;
• BH progenitors of the ﬁnal SMBH evolve in symbiosis with
their host galaxies. The predicted AGN-driven mass outﬂow rate
at z = 6.4 shows a radial proﬁle that is broadly consistent with the
lower limits inferred from CII observations by Cicone et al. (2015);
• The predicted ﬁnal BH-to-bulge (total) stellar mass ratio,
MBH/Mstar = 0.013 (0.011), is within the scatter of the observed
local relation and a factor of ∼ 25 lower than inferred from dynam-
ical mass observations of J1148. The discrepancy is signiﬁcantly
reduced if we account for the mass within 2.5 kpc from the nucleus,
the region targeted by CO data. At this radius, the mean bulge stel-
lar mass is (3.9 ± 0.2) × 1010 M
, much closer to the observational
⊙
value.

As a consequence of the lower gas accretion rates, the average
BH mass predicted by Valiante et al. (2016) is much smaller than in
our reference model, at all but the latest redshifts (see their Fig. 3).
˙Maccr ≤ 20 ˙MEdd.
This diﬀerence is reduced when we impose that
In this case, the average BH progenitor mass at z ∼ 15 is compa-
rable in the two models. However, while in Valiante et al. (2016)
the mass growth is triggered by the formation of heavy seeds, in
our model this is achieved by mildly super-Eddington accretion on
light BH seeds.

The progenitors of SMBHs at z > 6 experience the strong
form of coevolution deﬁned by Kormendy & Ho (2013), where
galaxies aﬀect BH growth by controlling BH feeding and merging,

Figure 11. Mean bolometric luminosity of BH progenitors as a function of
the mean BH mass predicted by the reference model (black solid line) and

lines show the average among the 29 merger trees and the shaded regions
are the 1-σ dispersion. The data points show the observational values of the

and BHs control galaxy properties via AGN feedback. In fact, while
the small radiative eﬃciencies of super-Eddington accreting BHs
is indispensable to limit the eﬀects of AGN feedback (Lupi et al.
2015), at z > 10 the BHs shine at a few Eddington luminosities
with a noticeable eﬀect on the cold gas content of their host galax-
ies. At lower z, an increasing fraction of BH progenitors accrete
at sub-Eddington rates, but with larger radiative eﬃciencies. As a
result of the larger BH mass and BH accretion rates, AGN-driven
winds at z < 10 power strong galaxy-scale outﬂows and suppress
star formation, leading to the down-turn of the total SFR shown in
Fig. 1.

In Fig. 11 we show the average bolometric luminosity as a
function of the average BH mass of SMBH progenitors for the ref-
erence model (black solid line) and for the model with ˙Maccr ≤
20 ˙MEdd (yellow solid line). The model predictions are compared
with observations of SDSS J1148 (z = 6.4) and of the most distant
quasar currently known, ULAS J1120 at z = 7.1 (Mortlock et al.
2011). The errorbars on the bolometric luminosities account for the
observational uncertainties on the ﬂux at 1450 Å and on the bolo-
metric corrections (Richards et al. 2006). Some reference values of
the luminosity in units of the Eddington luminosity are shown by
the diagonal dashed lines. The diﬀerence among the two models re-
ﬂects the diﬀerent BH accretion history: in the model with ˙Maccr ≤
20 ˙MEdd the ﬁrst BH progenitors accrete at a lower rate, saving cold
gas for the latest evolutionary phases. As a result, for BH progen-
itors with MBH . 108 M
, the mean luminosity predicted by the
⊙
reference model is always super-Eddington (with Lbol > 10 LEdd
), whereas in the model with ˙Maccr ≤ 20 ˙MEdd
when MBH . 106 M
⊙
the mean luminosity is always 0.1 LEdd < Lbol < LEdd. However, in
the latest evolutionary phases, when MBH > 108 M
, this trend is
⊙
reversed. Given the observational uncertainties and the large vari-
ability among diﬀerent merger trees, the luminosity of J1148 is
consistent with the model predictions. Interestingly, the data point
of ULAS J1120 is also lying within the 1-σ dispersion. Indeed, we

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2016)

ﬁnd that ∼ 20% of BH progenitors at z = 7.1 have luminosities
and masses compatible with the observed values of ULAS J1120,
indicating that this quasar may be one of the progenitors of SDSS
J1148 at z = 6.4.
