Abstract

D0 collaboration has recently discovered new multiquark states X(5568) decaying into B0
s

π±.

The quark contents in these states must have four diﬀerent ﬂavors ¯bsu ¯d or ¯bsd¯u. We study these

states from light quark ﬂavor SU (3) symmetry point of view to identify their symmetry properties.

The multiplets which contains states with three diﬀerent light quarks must be ¯6 or 15 of SU (3)

representation. The mass splitting of X(5568) and B meson only allows X to decay into ﬁnal states

with a B meson and a pion. We study such possible decays by constructing a leading order chiral

Lagrangian, and also provide searching strategies to determine whether the X(5568) states belong

to ¯6 or 15 . In particular, if X(5568) belongs to 15, there is a new doubly charged four quark
state which can decay into B+π+ with a decay width twice as large as that for X(5568) → B0

π±.

INTRODUCTION

the invariant energy spectrum of B0

D0 collaboration has recently discovered a new multiquark state X(5568) by studying
s and π± based on 10.4 fb−1 p¯p collision at √s = 1.96
GeV[1]. The spectrum shows the existence of a resonant state X(5568) with a mass and a

width given by

mX = 5567.8 ± 2.9(stat)+0.9

−1.9(syst)MeV ,

Γ = 21.9 ± 6.4(stat)+5.0

−2.5(syst)MeV.

s π± followed by B0

The discovery channel is X(5568) → B0
s → J/ψφ, the signiﬁcance is 5.1
σ. The J/ψ is reconstructed by the decay J/ψ → µ+µ− and φ is identiﬁed by the decay
φ → K +K −. This is the ﬁrst observation of hadronic states with four diﬀerent valence quark
s π±, the valence quarks can be identiﬁed to have ¯bsu ¯d or
ﬂavors. From the decay product B0
¯bsd¯u. The D0 collaboration ﬁt favors the quantum number of X(5568) to be J CP = 0++,

but cannot rule out the possibility that these states are 1++ ones. In this paper we assume

X(5568) has J CP = 0++.

The X(5568) might be a tightly bound state of di-quark anti-quark pair such as [su][¯b ¯d] or
[sd][¯b¯u], or a “molecular state” of the loosely bound Bu,d and K or Bs and π mesons. Whether

this is really a bound state or due to some other eﬀect still need to be investigated[2]. Several

theoretical papers have appeared focusing on the mass estimate, width and J CP nature[3],

and also possible partner states in tetraquark model[4]. Here we will analyze these states

from ﬂavor SU(3) symmetry point of view to study the possibility of other similar states

and their decay modes.

The X(5568) states are constructed from an anti-b quark ¯b, two light quarks qiqj and

one light anit-quark ¯qk. Under the ﬂavor SU(3) symmetry, the anti-b quark is a singlet, the
light anti-quark is a ¯3, and the light quark is a 3. As far as the SU(3) group structure is

concerned, the irreducible states are

3 × 3 × ¯3 = 3 + 3 + ¯6 + 15 .

(2)

The 3 representations do not contain a component with three diﬀerent light quarks (anti-
quark), therefore X(5568) cannot be in the 3 representation. In the ¯6 representation, the

two light quarks are anti-symmetric, while in the 15 representation the two light quarks are

symmetric. Both representations have states with three diﬀerent quark ﬂavors (including

2

an anit-quark). Let us denote the states with four diﬀerent quarks in ¯6 and 15 as X ′ and

X, respectively:

′

ds¯u ∼ ¯b¯u(ds − sd) , X

ud¯s ∼ ¯b¯s(ud − du) ,
¯6 : X
15 : Xds¯u ∼ ¯b¯u(ds + sd) , Xsu ¯d ∼ ¯b ¯d(su + us) , Xud¯s ∼ ¯b¯s(ud + du) .

su ¯d ∼ ¯b ¯d(su − us) , X

′

′

(3)

Since the decay modes B0
ds¯u(Xds¯u) and X ′

s π± have been observed, the X(5568) should be identiﬁed with
X ′
su ¯d(Xsu ¯d). With limited information so far, one cannot determine whether
X(5568) state belongs to ¯6 or 15. From diquark picture of four quark states[5], depending

on where the two anti-quarks are in ﬂavor symmetric or antisymmetric anti-diquark system,
combined with the ¯6 or the 15 they can form 0++ or 1++ states. More information is

need to identify the representation where X(5568) belong. One interesting feature is that

if SU(3) ﬂavor symmetry is a good (approximate) symmetry to describe the properties, it

predicts a new state X ′

ud¯s(Xud¯s) with diﬀerent light quark ﬂavors. There are also other states

depending on which representation X(5568) belongs to.

The representations ¯6 and 15 can be written in tensor notations as, X k

{i,j},
respectively. Here [i, j] and {i, j} indicate anti-symmetric and symmetric combinations
under exchange of i and j. Both X(¯6) and X(15) are traceless, that is, X i
{i,j} = 0.

One can construct a chiral perturbation theory[6] to describe a X decays into a B meson

and a light octet pseudoscalar Π. Here Π is the normalized pseudoscalar octect containing
π0, π±, K ±, K 0, ¯K 0, η ﬁelds.

Under chiral SU(3)L × SU(3)R, the Goldstone boson ﬁeld Σ ≡ exp(2iπ(x)/f ) transforms
as Σ → LΣR† with π(x) = Π/√2. f ≈ 93 MeV is the pion decay constant. It is convenient
to deﬁne another ﬁeld ξ(x) by Σ(x) ≡ ξ(x)2, which transforms as ξ(x) → Lξ(x)U †(x) =
U(x)ξ(x)R†. The 3×3 matrix ﬁeld U(x) depends on Goldstone ﬁelds π(x) as well as on the
global SU(3) transformation matrices L and R, thereby being x-dependent ﬁeld describing

hidden local SU(3) transformation in chiral symmetric theories. The ﬁelds X and Bi =
(Bu, Bd, Bs) transforms as ¯6 or 15, and 3 of SU(3), respectively:

X i
jk → U i

i′X i′

j ′k′(U †)j ′

j(U †)k′

k, Bi → U j

i Bj.

It is convenient to deﬁne two vector ﬁelds with following properties under chiral trans-

formations:

Vµ =

1

2 (cid:0)ξ†∂µξ + ξ∂µξ†(cid:1) → UVµU † + U∂µU † , Aµ =

1

2 (cid:0)ξ†∂µξ − ξ∂µξ†(cid:1) → UAµU † . (6)

Note that V transforms like a gauge ﬁeld for local SU(3).

For the pionic transitions X → Bπ, the mass diﬀerence between X and B is very small
and the pion is soft. Therefore we can use the heavy particle eﬀective theory for X and B,

assuming their velocity v is conserved [6]. We should keep in mind that X and B ﬁelds have

velocity v dependence so that they are actually X(v) and B(v). The SU(3) properties of

the relevant ﬁelds are given by X i

jk and Bi. One then has

L = Biv · DB + Xiv · DX − XMξX − Bv · AX

(7)

where we assume that all the SU(3) ﬂavor indices are contracted appropriately in order to

respect chiral symmetry.

(8)

Here X k

ij can be X k

{i,j} depending on whether it is a ¯6 or a 15. When constructing the
above leading order chiral Lagrangian, we have assumed that the Lagrangian respects parity,

[i,j] or X k

charge-conjugation and Lorentz symmetries, and chiral symmetry in terms of local SU(3)

4

hidden gauge symmetry mentioned before. The explicit forms of the last two operators shall

be explained below in detail. Note that the velocity v dependent scalar ﬁelds X and B we
are using now include a wavefunction normalization factors √MX and √MB respectively.
Therefore their mass dimensions are [X] = [B] = 3/2, and not 1, in this formulation.

We would like to comment that if X turns out to be a multiplet with J P = 1++ the

analysis is similar. One just needs to replace the 0++ state for X by a 1++ state Xµ

with a Lorentz index. In our discussions below we will concentrate on the SU(3) symmetry

properties and therefore will not show the Lorentz indices which should always be contracted.

In the exact SU(3) limit, all the X states in each representation have the same mass,

either m¯6 or m15, which are removed in the velocity-dependent heavy particle eﬀective

theory formalism. This degeneracy is broken by light quark masses, which is schematically

represented as XMξX in Eq. (7). Including all possible combinations, the corrections come

from the following terms

Expanding the above expressions, we obtain the masses of the states in ¯6 and 15 repre-

15 representations respectively.

X ′

The above equations imply that, when u and d quark mass contributions are neglected,
ds¯u(Xds¯u) and X ′

ud¯s (Xud¯s) will
be diﬀerent. The states Zuu ¯d, Zdd¯u, Yπ ¯u and Yπ ¯d in the 15 representation do not receive

su ¯d(Xsu ¯d) are degenerate in mass. But the correction to X ′

any corrections and are degenerate in mass. Mass measurement for any one of them will

determine m15.

One can derive sum rules for the masses of tetraquark states in the ¯6 or 15 analogous

to Gell-Mann-Okubo formulae. The sum rules obtained from eqs.(11) and (12) will provide

useful information to reconstruct the masses such as the mass of X(X ′)ud¯s. We will come

back to this later.

Even if X(5568) → BiKj channel are not open, one can still study the properties of
X(5568) and their partners by looking for kinematically allowed X(5568) → Bπ decays.
The terms responsible for these decays come from the last operator of Eq.(7), which are
renormalizable interactions with dimensionless couplings α and α′ of ∼ O(1):

In the above equations, there is a common overall factor Eπ/√2fπ from v · A term, which
we do not show explicitly in the above expressions. Also one has to include the wavefunction
normalization factors, √MXMB for the X and B ﬁelds as mentioned before.

s π± decays. If
kinematically allowed there should be also decay with a kaon in the ﬁnal states. Unfortu-

The couplings of Xds¯u and Xsu ¯d to B0

nately, since the mass of X(5568) is about 5568 MeV, and the lightest Bi has a mass of 5279
MeV, X(5568) → BK type of decays are not allowed. With oﬀ-shell, B and K decay into
lighter particles, the decay branching ratios may be small. This poses diﬃculties to study
the properties of these new states. We will comment on some possible test involve X → Bη
at the end. The partner states in ¯6 and 15 decay channels with π± or π0 in the ﬁnal states

can provide interesting information about these states should they exist.

From the leading order chiral Lagrangian with all the aforementioned factors correctly

7

included, we can evaluate the decay rate for X(5568) → Bsπ± as follows:

M(X(5568) → Bsπ±) =

Γ(X(5568) → Bsπ±) =

EπpMXMBs

MX (cid:18)Eπ

MBs

≈ 21.9MeV,

(16)

which leads to |α′| ≈ 1.3. We have used an approximation Eπ ≈ (MX − MBs), ignoring the
recoil energy of Bs, and pπ = pE2
π. Similarly |α| ≈ 1.3 if X(5568) belongs to the 15

π − m2

representation.

Note that Xsu ¯d and Xds¯u for both ¯6 and 15 have the same decay width. There are several
states which can also decay into a Bi plus a π with similar or even larger decay widths.

Experimental measurement of these possible decay modes can provide crucial information

about SU(3) ﬂavor symmetry, and can also determine whether the X(5568) state belongs
to ¯6 or 15. We now propose some search strategies for other states and also ways to study

the properties of the X(5568).

To distinguishing whether X(5568) belongs to a ¯6 or a 15, the obvious way is to ﬁnd all

the other states in the representation, for example ﬁnd the state Xud¯s with four diﬀerent

quarks. The discovery of this state would be a clear evidence that SU(3) is at working to

organize the states in SU(3) symmetric way. But this is very diﬃcult to achieve because

that there is no two body decay channel available for analysis.

To determine whether X(5568) belongs to 15 or not is to ﬁnd the unique state Zuu ¯d. It
is a doubly charged state and can decay into B+π+ with a decay width twice as large as
X(5568) → B0
s π−). Should this state exist, it can be detected. Zdd¯u → B0π−
can also add new information. Another type of decays is ﬁnal states with B0π+. This only

s π+ (or B0

occurs if X(5568) belongs to the 15 representation.

Now we turn to ﬁnal states which are allowed for both ¯6 and 15 representations. We

note that the ratio R(B+π−/B0

s π0) of ﬁnal states with B+π− and B0

s π0 can also provide

useful information.

s π0) = Γ(Y ′

(u¯u,d ¯d)s → B0

If X(5568) belongs to ¯6, Y ′

(u¯u,s¯s)d → B+π+ and Y ′

s π0 are relevant. The ratio
s π0) is 1/2. While for X(5568)
R(B+π−/B0
s π0 are relevant.
being in the 15 representation, Yπd → B+π−, Yηd → B+π− and Yπs → B0
If experiments can ﬁnd the two separate states Yπd and Yηd, this already tells that X(5568)

(u¯u,s¯s)d → B+π+)/Γ(Y ′

(u¯u,d ¯d)s → B0

belongs to the 15 representation. However, if experiments cannot distinguish them, the

8

signal for B+π− will be counted together.
which is substantially diﬀerent than the case with X(5568) belongs to the ¯6.

In this case the ratio R(B+π−/B0

s π0) is 2/3

Once the representation for X(5568) has been determined, one can obtain all component

state masses. For those states which can decay into a pion in the ﬁnal states, their masses

can determined from experimental data. For those do not have such decay channel, the sum

rules derived from Eqs.(11) and (12) can be used to obtain the masses for those states. The

masses of those states which cannot be studied by Bπ decays can be expressed in terms of
those can be studied as the following for ¯6 or 15,

m(X

′

ud¯s) = 2 × m(Y

′

(d ¯d,s¯s)u) − m(X

ds¯u) ,

m(Zss¯u) = m(Zss ¯d) = 2m(Xsu ¯d) − m(Yπ ¯u) ,
m(Yη¯s) = m(Yπ¯s) + m(Yη¯u) − m(Yπ ¯u) ,
m(Xud¯s) = m(Zuu¯s) = m(Zdd¯s) =

1
2

(3m(Yη¯s) + 4m(Yπ ¯u) − 5m(Xsu ¯d)) .

(17)

Before we conclude, we would like to mention the possibility of using an oﬀ-shell light
pseudoscalar which subsequent decay into two photons to test whether X belongs to ¯6 or

s η → B0

s γγ ﬁnal state as an example. This can only happen if X belongs

s η which is unlikely to be kinematically allowed. However, the η has a

15, taking B0
to 15 by Yηs → B0
large branching ratio (39%)[7] decay into γγ, therefore Yηs → B0
observed. There are other states which can decay into B0

s γγ may be possible to be
s π0 →
s γγ with much larger decay widths. By removing events of the two γ close to pion mass

s γγ, such as Y ′

(u¯u,d ¯d)s, Yπs → B0

B0

can help to single out events with the two γs from η. This, however, also results in a much
suppressed event number with Γ(Yηs → B0
s π0 → Bsγγ) ∼ 4 × 10−5.
Although Yηs → B0
s γγ may be in principle provide useful information about the
nature of the X, it is extremely diﬃcult to carry out such tests experimentally.

s η → Bsγγ)/Γ(Yπs → B0

s η → B0

In conclusion, we have studied the X(5568) state recently discovered by D0 collaboration

from light quark ﬂavor SU(3) symmetry point of view. These states contain four diﬀerent

quarks. We found that under the ﬂavor SU(3) symmetry group, the multiplet which con-
tains these states must be in ¯6 or 15. We constructed the leading order chiral Lagrangian
describing the kinematically allowed transitions X → Bπ, and identiﬁed possible states
which can be studied by these decays. We also provided searching strategies to distinguish
whether the X(5568) states belong to ¯6 or 15. We found that if X(5568) belongs to 15,

there must be a new doubly charged four quark state which can decay into B+π+ with a

9

decay width twice as large as that for X(5568) → B0
s π±. There are several other features
which can also distinguish whether X(5568) belongs to ¯6 and 15. As a ﬁnal comment, we
would like to point out that replacing the ¯b quark by a ¯c quark, one can obtain a similar

class of states with the same SU(3) properties[4]. We urge our experimental colleagues to

carry out related searches.
