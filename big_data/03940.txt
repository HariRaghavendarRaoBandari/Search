A BRATTELI–VERSHIK REPRESENTATION FOR ALL

ZERO-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS

TAKASHI SHIMOMURA

Abstract. We show that every zero-dimensional system can have Bratteli–Vershik
representation. As a corollary, we get an analogue of the Krieger’s Lemma for zero-
dimensional systems.

1. Introduction

For the Cantor minimal systems, the Bratteli–Vershik representation has been a pow-
erful tool. Medynets [Med06] have shown that every Cantor aperiodic systems admits
this representation.
In this paper, we show that this representation is possible for all
zero-dimensional homeomorphisms. After some preliminaries for topological dynamics,
we repeat in § 3 a brief summery for graph coverings that is developed in [S14a]. In § 3.2,
we formulate a graph covering that is an inverse system of weighted graphs and its cov-
ering maps. Each edge of this weighted graphs is weighted with a positive integer that is
the length. This notion of the coverings is precisely included in the notion of the Bratteli–
Vershik representation with multiple maximal paths and minimal paths. In this section,
we prove Theorem 3.9 that states that every zero-dimensional system can be represented
as the inverse limit of such coverings. Furthermore, such coverings can be realized such
that shorter circuits contains a periodic orbit. As a corollary, we get an analogue of the
Krieger’s Lemma (cf. [Boy83]) for zero-dimensional case.

2. Preliminaries

Let Z be the set of all integers; N, the set of all non-negative integers; and N`, the
set of all positive integers. For integers a ă b, the intervals are denoted by ra, bs :“
t a, a`1, . . . , b u, ra, bq :“ t a, a`1, . . . , b´1 u and so on. A pair pX, f q of a compact metric
space X and a continuous surjection f : X Ñ X is called a topological dynamical system.
A topological dynamical system f : X Ñ X is topologically transitive or transitive if for
all pairs of non-empty open sets U, V Ă X, there exists an n ą 0 such that f pU q X V ‰ H.
It is well known that for a transitive system pX, f q, there exists a point x P X such that
t f ipxq | i ľ 0 u is a dense subset of X. A point with this property is said to be a transitive
point. A topological dynamical system pX, f q is called a zero-dimensional system, if X
is totally disconnected. A zero-dimensional system pX, f q is called a Cantor system, if
X is homeomorphic to the Cantor set, i.e., X does not have isolated points. When a
topological dynamical system pX, f q is homeomorphic, we say that pX, f q is expansive
with an expansive constant ε ą 0 if for every pair px, yq P X 2z∆X, there exists an n P Z
such that dpf npxq, f npyqq ľ ε. Let A be a ﬁnite set. An element x P AZ is written as

pxiqiPZ, and the shift map σ : AZ Ñ AZ is deﬁned as pσpxqqi “ xi`1 for all i P Z. Suppose
a closed subset Σ Ă AZ satisﬁes σpΣq “ Σ. Then, pΣ, σq is called a (two-sided) subshift.
A homeomorphic zero-dimensional system is expansive if and only if it is topologically
conjugate to a two-sided subshift.

3. Graph covering.

We have given the notion of the basic graph coverings for all zero-dimensional continuous
surjections under the naming of the sequences of covers (see [S14a, §3]), and developed a
basic observation of the ergodic theory of them (see [S14b]). We used the term of graph
covering or just covering in [S15a, S15b]. In this paper, we were forced to give a notion,
in which ﬁnite directed graph with multiple edges are permitted, and for each edge, a
positive integer that is called the length is assigned. In the next subsection, we repeat
the construction of basic graph coverings for general zero-dimensional systems that are
used in [S14a, S14b, S15a, S15b]. Later in § 3.2, we develop the notion of weighted graph
covering, in which multiple edges between a pair of vertices are permitted and for each
edge, the length is assigned. With this weighted graph covering, we would like to give
an extension of a result by Medynets [Med06]. In this paper, he showed that there exists
Bratteli-Vershik expression for Cantor homeomorphisms without periodic points.

3.1. Basic graph covering. A pair G “ pV, Eq that consists of a ﬁnite set V and a
relation E Ď V ˆ V on V can be considered as a directed graph with vertices V and an
edge from u to v when pu, vq P E. The ﬁnite directed graph G “ pV, Eq, in this sense, is
called a basic graph in this paper. We write as V “ V pGq and E “ EpGq.

Notation 3.1. In this paper, we assume that a basic graph G “ pV, Eq is a surjective
relation, i.e., for every vertex v P V there exist edges pu1, vq, pv, u2q P E.

For basic graphs Gi “ pVi, Eiq with i “ 1, 2, a map ϕ : V1 Ñ V2 is said to be a graph
homomorphism if for every edge pu, vq P E1, it follows that pϕpuq, ϕpvqq P E2. In this case,
we write as ϕ : G1 Ñ G2. For a graph homomorphism ϕ : G1 Ñ G2, we say that ϕ is
edge-surjective if ϕpE1q “ E2. Suppose that a graph homomorphism ϕ : G1 Ñ G2 satisﬁes
the following condition:

pu, vq, pu, v1q P E1 implies that ϕpvq “ ϕpv1q.

In this case, ϕ is said to be `directional. Suppose that a graph homomorphism ϕ : G1 Ñ
G2 satisﬁes the following condition:

pu, vq, pu1, vq P E1 implies that ϕpuq “ ϕpu1q.

In this case, ϕ is said to be ´directional. A graph homomorphism is bidirectional if it
satisﬁes both.

Deﬁnition 3.2. For a basic graphs G1 and G2, a graph homomorphism ϕ : G1 Ñ G2 is
called a cover if it is a `directional edge-surjective graph homomorphism.

For a sequence G1

ϕ3ÐÝ ¨ ¨ ¨ of graph homomorphisms and m ą n, we write
ϕm,n :“ ϕn`1 ˝ ϕn`2 ˝ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˝ ϕm. Then, ϕm,n is a graph homomorphism. If all ϕi pi P N`q
are edge-surjective, then every ϕm,n is edge-surjective. If all ϕi pi P N`q are covers, every
ϕm,n is a cover. Let G0 :“ pt v0 u, t pv0, v0q uq be a singleton graph. For a sequence of

this numbering of basic covering. In the original paper, we have used the numbering as

we denote a closed and open set U pvq :“ ϕ´1

that there exist a sequence t unk | unk P Vnk , k ľ 1 u such that ϕnk`1,nkpunk`1q “ unk for

Ťnľ0 Un generates the topology of X. Conversely, suppose that Un pn ľ 0q is a sequence

Ťnľ0 Un generates the topology of X, and f : X Ñ X be a continuous surjective map
such that for any U P Un`1 there exists U 1 P Un such that f pU q Ă U 1. Then, we can deﬁne

Notation 3.6. Let G “ pV, Eq be a basic graph. A sequence of vertices w “ pv0, v1, . . . , vlq
of G is said to be a walk of length l if pvi, vi`1q P E for all 0 ĺ i ă l. We denote lpwq :“ l.
In this case, for 0 ĺ a ĺ b ĺ l, we denote a restricted walk as wra, bs :“ pva, va`1, . . . , vbq.
We say that a walk w “ pv0, v1, . . . , vlq is a path if the vi p0 ĺ i ĺ lq are mutually
distinct. A walk c “ pv0, v1, . . . , vlq is said to be a cycle of period l if v0 “ vl, and a cycle
c “ pv0, v1, . . . , vlq is a circuit of period l if the vi p0 ĺ i ă lq are mutually distinct. A
circuit c and a path p are considered to be subgraphs of G with period lpcq and length
lppq, respectively. For a walk w “ pv0, v1, . . . , vlq, we deﬁne V pwq :“ t vi | 0 ĺ i ĺ l u and
Epwq :“ t pvi, vi`1q | 0 ĺ i ă l u. For a subgraph G1 of G, we also deﬁne V pG1q and EpG1q
in the same manner. For a walk w and a subgraph G1, we also denote a closed and open
set U pwq :“ ŤvPV pwq U pvq and U pG1q :“ ŤvPV pG1q U pvq.
Notation 3.7. Let w1 “ pu0, u1, . . . , ulq and w2 “ pv0, v1, . . . , vl1q be walks such that ul “
v0. Then, we denote w1w2 :“ pu0, u1, . . . , ul, v1, v2, . . . , vl1q. Evidently, we get lpw1w2q “
l ` l1. If c is a cycle of length l, then for any positive integer n, a cycle cn of length ln is
well deﬁned. When a walk wcw1 can be constructed, a walk wc0w1 means ww1.

Deﬁnition 3.8. A basic graph G is irreducible if for any pair of vertices pu, vq of G, there
exists a walk from u to v. In this case, for any vertices u, v P V pGq, there exists a walk w
from u to v such that Epwq “ EpGq.

3.2. Weighted graph covering by the lengths. In this section, we shall deﬁne the
‘weighted graphs’. For the readability to distinguish from the basic graphs, if we want to
emphasize that G “ pV, Eq is a weighted (directed) graph, we write as G “ pV , Eq with
over lines for a set of vertices, a set of edges and a graph itself. Later, we shall also deﬁne
a basic graph ˇG “ p ˇV , ˇEq from a weighted graph G. A pair G “ pV , Eq of ﬁnite sets is
called a weighted graph with the set of vertices V and the set of edges E, if the followings
are satisﬁed:

‚ there should be the source map s : E Ñ V and the range map r : E Ñ V ,
‚ each vertex v P V has edges e1, e2 P E such that spe1q “ rpe2q “ v, and
‚ there exists a weight map l : E Ñ N`.

We permit multiple directed edges between a pair of vertices. The weight map is also
called the length map l : E Ñ N`, i.e., each edge e P E has the weight (length) lpeq P N`.
As stated above, from now on, we shall construct a basic graph from a weighted graph
G “ pV , Eq. For each e P E with lpeq ľ 2, we make a set V peq of vertices V peq :“
t ve,0 “ speq, ve,1, ve,2, . . . , ve,lpeq´1, ve,lpeq “ tpeq u. For each e P E with lpeq “ 1, we denote
V peq :“ t speq “ rpeq u. Let ˇV “ ŤePE V peq. For each e P E, we make the set of edges
Epeq “ pve,i, ve,i`1q for all 0 ĺ i ă lpeq. Let ˇE “ ŤePE Epeq. Then, we gain a basic
graph ˇG “ p ˇV , ˇEq. From the construction, the set V is considered to be a subset of ˇV .

Note that if for a vertex v P V , there exist more than one edges with length 1 that are
directed from v to v, then they are merged to a single edge pv, vq P V ˆ V Ď ˇV ˆ ˇV . If
we take e, e1 P E with e ‰ e1, then we get V peq X V pe1q Ď t speq, tpeq u Ď V . Each e P E
is considered to be a path or a circuit pve,0, ve,1, ve,2, . . . , ve,lpeq´1, ve,lpeqq of ˇG, and we
denote vpe, iq :“ ve,i for 0 ĺ i ĺ lpeq. A sequence w “ e1e2 ¨ ¨ ¨ ek pei P E, i “ 1, 2, . . . , kq
is a walk, if rpeiq “ spei`1q for all 1 ĺ i ă k. The range map rpwq :“ rpekq and the
source map spwq :“ spe1q are deﬁned. A walk w is a cycle if spwq “ tpwq. We denote
as Epwq :“ t ei | 1 ĺ i ĺ k u, and V pwq :“ t speiq | 1 ĺ i ĺ k u Y t tpekq u. A cycle
w “ e1e2 ¨ ¨ ¨ ek is a circuit if speiq p1 ĺ i ĺ kq are mutually distinct. The length of the walk
is deﬁned as lpwq :“ ř1ĺiĺk lpeiq. For a walk w “ e1e2 ¨ ¨ ¨ ek pei P E, i “ 1, 2, . . . , kq of G,
we deﬁne a set of vertices V pwq :“ t speiq | 1 ĺ i ĺ k u Y t tpekq u, and the set of weighted
edges Epwq :“ t ei | 1 ĺ i ĺ k u. A walk w “ e1e2 ¨ ¨ ¨ ek pei P E, i “ 1, 2, . . . , kq of G is also
considered to be a walk of ˇG. We write wpiq “ ei for 1 ĺ i ĺ k, if we consider w as a walk
of G. We write wpﬁrstq “ e1 and wplastq “ ek. If we want to consider w as a walk in ˇG,
i.e., when w is expressed as w “ pv0, v1, . . . , vlpwqq with vi P ˇV for all 0 ĺ i ĺ lpwq, then we
write ˇwpiq “ vi P ˇV for all 0 ĺ i ĺ lpwq. For a weighted graph G “ pV , Eq, the set of walks
of ﬁnite length is denoted as W pGq. Let G1 “ pV 1, E 1q and G2 “ pV 2, E 2q be weighted
graphs. Let W 2 “ W pG2q. A graph homomorphism ϕ : G1 Ñ G2 is a pair of maps
ϕV : V 1 Ñ V 2 and ϕE : E 1 Ñ W 2 such that ϕV pspeqq “ spppϕEpeqqpﬁrstqq and ϕV ptpeqq “

A graph homomorphism ϕ is `directional, if for every e, e1 P E 1 with speq “ spe1q, the

ϕ is ´directional, if for every e, e1 P E 1 with tpeq “ tpe1q, the walks w “ ϕEpeq and

if it
satisﬁes both. A graph homomorphism ϕ : G1 Ñ G2 is called a graph covering or covering
if it is `directional and edge-surjective. For a covering ϕ : G1 Ñ G2, it is easy to see that
there exists a natural covering ˇϕ : ˇG1 Ñ ˇG2. If ϕ is bidirectional, then ˇϕ is bidirectional.

Let pX, f q be a zero-dimensional homeomorphic system, i.e., f is a homeomorphism.
We ﬁx a metric d on X. For a zero-dimensional homeomorphism pX, f q, a positive integer
h, and a closed and open set U Ď X, ξ :“ t f ipU q | 0 ĺ i ă h u is called a tower with the
base U and the height h, if f ipU q’s p0 ĺ i ă hq are mutually disjoint. In this case, we write
¯U :“ Ť ξ, and abbreviate that ¯U “ Ť0ĺiăh f ipU q is a tower with the height h and the base
U . Suppose that V X ¯U “ H. We say a tower ¯V :“ Ť0ĺi1ăh1 f i1pV q accompanies the tower

We say a tower ¯V :“ Ť0ĺi1ăh1 f i1pV q accompanies the tower ¯U :“ Ť0ĺiăh f ipU q properly,
if the tower ¯V accompanies the tower ¯U , and f h1´1pV qXf ipU q ‰ H for an i with 0 ĺ i ă h
implies i “ h ´ 1. Note that, when h “ 1, the accompaniments are always proper. We
call a map B : E Ñ t U | U is closed and open and U ‰ H u a base map. Let G “ pV , Eq
be a weighted graph. Suppose that a base map B satisﬁes the followings:

pV q X f ipU q ‰ H p0 ĺ i ă h, 0 ĺ i1 ă h1q implies f i1

Then, the base map B is said to be compatible base map from G to pX, f q, and we write

there exists a unique natural map ˇϕB : X Ñ ˇV such that t p ˇϕpxq, ˇϕpf pxqqq | x P X u “ ˇE.

‚ V n`1 :“ t U pKiq | 1 ĺ i ĺ r1 u,
‚ En`1 :“ t U pjq | 1 ĺ j ĺ r u,

The covering map ϕn`1 : Gn`1 Ñ Gn is deﬁned as follows:

Proof of Proposition 3.11. We show a proof by induction. Actually, we will show the
followings inductively for l “ 1, 2, . . . . There exist an integer rl ľ 1, and a ﬁnite set
t U pj, lq | 1 ĺ j ĺ rl u of closed and open subsets that is a reﬁnement of t U pvq | v P V u,
integers 0 ă hj,l p1 ĺ j ĺ rlq, and vj,l, v1

(a) U pj, lq Ď U pvj,lq and f hj,lpU pj, lqq Ď U pv1
(b) diampf ipU pj, lqqq ĺ ε for all 0 ĺ i ĺ hj,l, 1 ĺ j ĺ rl,
(c) ¯U pj, lq :“ Ť0ĺiăhj,l

If this is shown, then letting r :“ rL, U pj, Lq and hj :“ hj,L for 1 ĺ j ĺ rL, we get the
conclusion.

Proof for the case in which l “ 1: Firstly, we show the proof for the case in which l “ 1.
Deﬁne K1 :“ t x P X | f 1pxq “ x u. Suppose that K1 ‰ H. It is easy to make a ﬁnite set
t Kpd, 1q | 1 ĺ d ĺ d1 u of closed and open sets of the subspace K1 such that

‚ for each 1 ĺ d ĺ d1, there exists a vpdq P V such that Kpd, 1q Ď U pvpdqq,
‚ Ťt Kpd, 1q | 1 ĺ d ĺ d1, u “ K1,
‚ Kpd, 1q p1 ĺ d ĺ d1q are mutually disjoint,
‚ for each 1 ĺ d ĺ d1 diampKpd, 1qq ĺ ε{2.

Therefore, there exist closed and open sets V pd, 0q Ě Kpd, 1q p1 ĺ d ĺ d1q such that

‚ for each 1 ĺ d ĺ d1, V pd, 0q, f pV pd, 0qq Ď U pvpdqq,
‚ for each 1 ĺ d ĺ d1, diampV pd, 0qq ĺ ε.

We consider that ¯V pd, 0q “ W pd, 1q p1 ĺ d ĺ d1q are mutually disjoint towers of the
heights 1. We consider the towers ¯V pj, 0q with the heights hpj, 0q :“ 1 for all 1 ĺ j ĺ d1.
¯V pj, 0q Ě K1. Suppose that K1 “ H.
Thus, we have a closed and open set V0 :“ Ť1ĺjĺd1
Then, we deﬁne d1 :“ 0 and V0 :“ H. Let V 0 :“ ŤvPV U pvqzV0 and X 0 :“ XzV0. Then,
V 0 and X 0 are also closed and open sets. Let x P V 0. Suppose that x is a periodic point
of the least period hpxq. Then, hpxq ą 1. Take a closed and open set V pxq Q x such that
V pxq Ď U pvq and f hpxqpV pxqq Ď U pvq for a v P V with f hpxqpxq “ x P U pvq, f ipV pxqq’s
p0 ĺ i ă hpxqq and mutually disjoint, and diampf ipV pxqq ĺ ε for all 0 ĺ i ĺ hpxq.
Next, suppose that x is not periodic. Take an integer hpxq ą 1 arbitrarily large such
that f hpxqpxq P U pv1q for a v1 P V . We take a closed and open set V pxq Q x such that
V pxq Ď U pvq and f hpxqpV pxqq Ď U pv1q for some v, v1 P V , f ipV pxqq’s p0 ĺ i ă hpxqq and
mutually disjoint, and diampf ipV pxqqq ĺ ε for all 0 ĺ i ĺ hpxq.

Take a ﬁnite set t xj | 1 ĺ j ĺ n u such that Ť1ĺjĺn V pxjq “ V 0. We write hpjq :“
hpxjq ą 1 for each 1 ĺ j ĺ n. We deﬁne V p1q :“ V px1q. When V pjq is deﬁned for
1 ĺ j ă n, we deﬁne ¯V pjq :“ Ť0ĺiăhpjq f ipV pjqq, and
V pj ` 1q :“ V pxj`1qz ď
1ĺj 1ĺj

¯V pj1q.

When, V pnq is deﬁned, then we deﬁne ¯V pnq :“ Ť0ĺiăhpnq f ipV pnqq. Then, we get
¯V pjq Ě V 0. We note that ¯V pjq’s may not be mutually disjoint. Moreover, each
Ť1ĺjĺn
¯V pjq p1 ĺ j ĺ nq may not be disjoint with some of W pj1, 0q p1 ĺ j1 ĺ d1q. We begin an-
other induction for α “ 1, 2, . . . , n. Let α “ 1. For each x P V p1q, let 0 ă i1 ă i2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă
inpxq ă hp1q be the maximal sequence such that f ikpxq enters some V pj, 0q p1 ĺ j ĺ d1q.
If f ipxq R V pj, 0q for all
This sequence is denoted as Ipxq :“ t ik | 1 ĺ k ĺ npxq u.
0 ă i ă hp1q and for all 1 ĺ j ĺ d1, then Ipxq :“ H. For each k with 1 ĺ k ĺ npxq, let
jkp1 ĺ jk ĺ d1q be such that f ikpxq P V pjk, 0q. We make a string spxq :“ ppik, jkqq1ĺkĺnpkq,
and a set Sp1q :“ t spxq | x P V p1q u. Let V psq :“ t x P V p1q | spxq “ s u for each s P Sp1q.
Then, we get a disjoint union V p1q “ Ťt V psq | s P Sp1q u by closed and open sets. More-
over, ¯V psq :“ Ť0ĺiăhp1q f ipV psqq ps P Sp1qq are towers and mutually disjoint. It is evident
that the towers ¯V psq ps P Sp1qq accompany the towers ¯V pj, 0q p1 ĺ j ĺ d1q properly. Now,
we cut oﬀ the towers ¯V psq’s from each V pj, 0q’s. Precisely, for each 1 ĺ j ĺ d1, we deﬁne
¯V psq and ¯V 1pj, 0q :“ V 1pj, 0q. Now, we have a mutually disjoint
V 1pj, 0q :“ V pj, 0qz ŤsPSp1q
towers t ¯V 1pj, 0q | 1 ĺ j ĺ d1 u Y t ¯V psq | s P Sp1q u. We note that for all s P Sp1q, the
heights of the towers ¯V psq ps P Sp1qq are hp1q ą 1. We reorder these towers and rewrite
the bases V pj, 1q p1 ĺ j ĺ t1q, the heights hpj, 1q p1 ĺ j ĺ t1q, and the towers ¯V pj, 1q
¯V pj, 1q, then it follows that V1 “ V0 Y ¯V p1q.

Particularly, for each 2 ĺ j ĺ n, it follow that V pjq X V1 “ H.

Suppose that for 0 ă α ă n, there exist a tα ą 0, the bases V pj, αq p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq, the

heights hpj, αq p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq, and vertices vpj, αq, v1pj, αq P V p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq such that
(a) V pj, αq Ď U pvpj, αqq and f hpj,αqpV pj, αqq Ď U pv1pj, αqq for each 1 ĺ j ĺ tα,
(b) diampf ipV pj, αqqq ĺ ε for all 0 ĺ i ĺ hpj, αq, 1 ĺ j ĺ tα,
(c) ¯V pj, αq :“ Ť0ĺiăhpj,lq f ipV pj, αqq is a tower for each 1 ĺ j ĺ tα,
(d) the towers ¯V pj, αq p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq are mutually disjoint,

(e) for each 1 ĺ j ĺ tα with hpj, αq “ 1, the tower ¯V pj, αq contains a ﬁxed point, and
(f) if we deﬁne Vα :“ Ť1ĺjĺtα

¯V pj, αq, then Vα “ V0 Y Ť1ĺjĺα

¯V pjq.

We have already shown the proof for the case in which α “ 1. Let β “ α ` 1. By the
inductive hypothesis, Vα X V pβq “ H. For each x P V pβq, let 0 ă i1 ă i2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă inpxq ă
hpβq be the maximal sequence such that f ikpxq enters some V pj, αq p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq. This
sequence is denoted as Ipxq :“ t ik | 1 ĺ k ĺ npxq u. If f ipxq R V pj, αq for all 0 ă i ă hpβq
and for all 1 ĺ j ĺ tα, then Ipxq :“ H. For each k with 1 ĺ k ĺ npxq, let jkp1 ĺ jk ĺ tαq
be such that f ikpxq P V pjk, αq. We make a string spxq :“ ppik, jkqq1ĺkĺnpkq, and a set
Spβq :“ t spxq | x P V pβq u. Let V psq :“ t x P V pβq | spxq “ s u for each s P Spβq. Then,
we get a disjoint union V pβq “ Ťt V psq | s P Spβq u by closed and open sets. Moreover,
¯V psq :“ Ť0ĺiăhpβq f ipV psqq ps P Spβqq are towers and mutually disjoint. It is evident that
the towers ¯V psq ps P Spβqq accompany the towers ¯V pj, αq p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq. Unlike the case in
which β “ 1, for each s P Spβq, the accompaniment may not be proper, i.e., the following
may occur:

(3.1)

f hpβq´1pV psqq Ď f ipV pj, αqq with 1 ĺ j ĺ tα, 1 ĺ i ă hpj, αq ´ 1.

¯V psq. We get ¯V 1pj, αq :“ Ť0ĺiăhpj,αq f ipV 1pj, αqq “ ¯V pj, αqz ŤsPSpβq

Therefore, roughly, we extend the height of the tower ¯V psq for each s P Spβq.
If for
s P Spβq, (3.3) does not occur, then we need not change the height hpβq of the tower
¯V psq, i.e., the base is V psq and the height is hpsq :“ hpβq. If for s P Spβq, (3.3) occurs,
then we do not change the base V psq and change the height hpsq :“ hpβq ` hpj, αq ´ 1 ´ i.
Then, f hpsq´1pV psqq Ď f hpj,αq´1pV pj, αqq is satisﬁed. We need not care for the diameters
of f ipV psqq for 0 ĺ i ă hpsq, because the extended part is a part of the tower that has the
base V pj, αq. The disjointness of f ipV psqq p0 ĺ i ă hpsqq is also obvious. Now, we cut oﬀ
the towers ¯V psq’s from each V pj, αq’s. Precisely, for each 1 ĺ j ĺ tα, we deﬁne V 1pj, αq :“
¯V psq.
V pj, αqz ŤsPSpβq
Now, we have a mutually disjoint towers t ¯V 1pj, αq | 1 ĺ j ĺ tα u Y t ¯V psq | s P Spβq u. We
note that for all s P Spβq, it follows that hpsq ľ hpβq ą 1. We reorder these towers and
rewrite the bases V pj, βq p1 ĺ j ĺ tβq, the heights hpj, βq p1 ĺ j ĺ tβq, and the towers
¯V pj, βq p1 ĺ j ĺ tβq. If we deﬁne Vβ :“ Ť1ĺjĺtβ
¯V pj, βq, then Vβ “ Vα Y V pβq. Thus, by
induction, we have constructed the mutually disjoint towers ¯V pj, nq p1 ĺ j ĺ tnq for some
tn ą 0. Recall that for each 1 ĺ j ĺ n, hpjq ą 1. Thus, each tower of the height 1 has a
ﬁxed point. In this way, we have completed a proof of the following statement when l “ 1:
There exist an integer rl ľ 1, and a ﬁnite set t U pj, lq | 1 ĺ j ĺ rl u of closed and open
subsets that is a reﬁnement of t U pvq | v P V u, integers 0 ă hj,l p1 ĺ j ĺ rlq, and
vj,l, v1

j,l P V p1 ĺ j ĺ rlq that satisfy the following:

(a) U pj, lq Ď U pvj,lq and f hj,lpU pj, lqq Ď U pv1
(b) diampf ipU pj, lqqq ĺ ε for all 0 ĺ i ĺ hj,l, 1 ĺ j ĺ rl,
(c) ¯U pj, lq :“ Ť0ĺiăhj,l
(d) the towers ¯U pj, lq p1 ĺ j ĺ rlq are mutually disjoint, and
(e) for each 1 ĺ j ĺ rl with hj,l ĺ l, the tower ¯U pj, lq contains a periodic point of the

f ipU pj, lqq is a tower for each 1 ĺ j ĺ rl,

j,lq for each 1 ĺ j ĺ rl,

least period hj,l.

The inductive step: Suppose that the (a) to (e) is satisﬁed with an l ľ 1. Let L “ l ` 1.
Let J :“ t j P r1, rls | hj,l ĺ l u. Then, for each j P J, the tower ¯U pj, lq contains a periodic
orbit of the least period hj,l. We reorder t U pj, lq | j P J u as t V pj, ´1q | 1 ĺ j ĺ t´1 u.

We reorder the heights hj,l pj P Jq as well, and get the heights hpj, ´1q p1 ĺ j ĺ t´1q.
We deﬁne the towers ¯V pj, ´1q p1 ĺ j ĺ t´1q as well. The inductive hypothesis evidently
implies that there exist vertices vpj, ´1q, v1pj, ´1q P V p1 ĺ j ĺ t´1q such that

¯V pj, ´1q, V ´1 :“ ŤvPV U pvqzV´1, and X ´1 :“ XzV´1. We note that
Let V´1 :“ Ť1ĺjĺt´1
t x | Di p1 ĺ i ĺ lq, f ipxq “ x u Ď V´1. Deﬁne KL :“ t x P X ´1 | f Lpxq “ x u. Then, KL
is compact, and x P KL implies that f ipxq ‰ x for all i with 0 ă i ă L. Suppose that
KL ‰ H. It is easy to make a ﬁnite set t Kpd, Lq | 1 ĺ d ĺ dL u of closed and open sets of
the subspace KL such that

‚ for each 1 ĺ d ĺ dL, there exists a vpdq P V such that Kpd, Lq “ f LpKpd, Lqq Ď

‚ for each 1 ĺ d ĺ dL and 0 ĺ i ĺ L, diampf ipKpd, Lqqq ĺ ε{2.

We can also assume that for each 1 ĺ d ĺ dL, 0 ĺ i ă L, 1 ĺ j ĺ t´1 and 0 ĺ
it follows that f ipKpd, Lqq X f i1pV pj, ´1qq ‰ H implies f ipKpd, Lqq Ď

‚ for each 1 ĺ j ĺ dL, the tower ¯W pd, Lq accompanies all the towers ¯V pj1, ´1q

We note that the accompaniment of each tower ¯W pd, Lq p1 ĺ d ĺ dLq to the towers
¯W pd, Lq. Then, if we take the

We deﬁne a closed and open set V0 :“ Ť1ĺjĺt0
we get t x P X | f lpxq “ x, 1 ĺ l ĺ L u Ă V0. We deﬁne V 0 :“ ŤvPV U pvqzV0 and

there exists a v P V such that x P U pvq. Suppose that x is a periodic point of the

and diampf ipV pxqqq ĺ ε for all 0 ĺ i ĺ hpxq. Next, suppose that x is not periodic. Take
an integer hpxq ą L arbitrarily large such that f hpxqpxq P U pv1q for a v1 P V . We take
a closed and open set V pxq Q x such that V pxq Ď U pvq and f hpxqpV pxqq Ď U pv1q for the

In the same way, each ¯V pjq may not be disjoint with V pj, 0q p1 ĺ j ĺ t0q. We shall show

periodic orbit of the least period hpj, nq. Thus, we can conclude the inductive step for L,
and complete the proof. Therefore, we shall proceed the inductive step for α. First, we
shall show the case in which α “ 1. For each x P V p1q, let 0 ă i1 ă i2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă inpxq ă hp1q
be the maximal sequence such that f ikpxq enters some V pj, 0q p1 ĺ j ĺ t0q. This sequence
is denoted as Ipxq :“ t ik | 1 ĺ k ĺ npxq u. If f ipxq R V pj, 0q for all 0 ă i ă hp1q and
for all 1 ĺ j ĺ t0, then Ipxq :“ H. For each k with 1 ĺ k ĺ npxq, let jkp1 ĺ jk ĺ t0q
be such that f ikpxq P V pjk, 0q. We make a string spxq :“ ppik, jkqq1ĺkĺnpkq, and a set
Sp1q :“ t spxq | x P V p1q u. Let V psq :“ t x P V p1q | spxq “ s u for each s P Sp1q. Then,
we get a disjoint union V p1q “ Ťt V psq | s P Sp1q u by closed and open sets. Moreover,
¯V psq :“ Ť0ĺiăhp1q f ipV psqq ps P Sp1qq are towers and mutually disjoint. It is evident that
the towers ¯V psq ps P Sp1qq accompany the towers ¯V pj, 0q p1 ĺ j ĺ t0q. Nevertheless for

each s P Sp1q, the accompaniment may not be proper, i.e., the following may occur:

(3.2)

f hp1q´1pV psqq Ď f ipV pj, 0qq with 1 ĺ j ĺ t0, 1 ĺ i ă hpj, 0q ´ 1.

¯V psq. We get ¯V 1pj, 0q :“ Ť0ĺiăhpj,0q f ipV 1pj, 0qq “ ¯V pj, 0qz ŤsPSp1q

Therefore, as in some cases above, we extend the height of the tower ¯V psq for each s P Sp1q.
If for s P Sp1q, (3.2) does not occur, then we need not change the height of the tower ¯V psq,
i.e., the base is V psq and the height is hpsq :“ hp1q. If for s P Sp1q, (3.2) occurs, then
we do not change the base V psq and change the height hpsq :“ hp1q ` hpj, 0q ´ 1 ´ i.
Then, f hpsq´1pV psqq Ď f hpj,0q´1pV pj, 0qq is satisﬁed. We need not care for the diameters
of f ipV psqq for 0 ĺ i ă hpsq, because the extended part is a part of the tower that has the
base V pj, 0q. The disjointness of f ipV psqq p0 ĺ i ă hpsqq is also obvious. Now, we cut oﬀ
the towers ¯V psq’s from each V pj, 0q’s. Precisely, for each 1 ĺ j ĺ t0, we deﬁne V 1pj, 0q :“

Now, we have a mutually disjoint towers t ¯V 1pj, 0q | 1 ĺ j ĺ t0 u Y t ¯V psq | s P Sp1q u. We
note that for all s P Sp1q, it follows that hpsq ľ hp1q ą L. We reorder these towers and
rewrite the bases V pj, 1q p1 ĺ j ĺ t1q, the heights hpj, 1q p1 ĺ j ĺ t1q, and the towers
¯V pj, 1q, then V1 “ V0 Y ¯V p1q. Now, we
¯V pj, 1q p1 ĺ j ĺ t1q. If we deﬁne V1 :“ Ť1ĺjĺt1
proceed the inductive step for α. Suppose that for 0 ă α ă n, there exist a tα ą 0, the
bases V pj, αq p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq, the heights hpj, αq p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq, and vertices vpj, αq, v1pj, αq P
V p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq such that (a) to (f) are satisﬁed. Let β “ α ` 1. By the inductive
hypothesis (f), Vα X V pβq “ H. For each x P V pβq, let 0 ă i1 ă i2 ă ¨ ¨ ¨ ă inpxq ă hpβq be
the maximal sequence such that f ikpxq enters some V pj, αq p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq. This sequence
is denoted as Ipxq :“ t ik | 1 ĺ k ĺ npxq u. If f ipxq R V pj, αq for all 0 ă i ă hpβq and
for all 1 ĺ j ĺ tα, then Ipxq :“ H. For each k with 1 ĺ k ĺ npxq, let jkp1 ĺ jk ĺ tαq
be such that f ikpxq P V pjk, αq. We make a string spxq :“ ppik, jkqq1ĺkĺnpkq, and a set
Spβq :“ t spxq | x P V pβq u. Let V psq :“ t x P V pβq | spxq “ s u for each s P Spβq. Then,
we get a disjoint union V pβq “ Ťt V psq | s P Spβq u by closed and open sets. Moreover,
¯V psq :“ Ť0ĺiăhpβq f ipV psqq ps P Spβqq are towers and mutually disjoint. It is evident that
the towers ¯V psq ps P Spβqq accompany the towers ¯V pj, αq p1 ĺ j ĺ tαq. For each s P Spβq,
the accompaniment may not be proper, i.e., the following may occur:

(3.3)

f hpβq´1pV psqq Ď f ipV pj, αqq with 1 ĺ j ĺ tα, 1 ĺ i ă hpj, αq ´ 1.

Therefore, roughly, we extend the height of the tower ¯V psq for each s P Spβq. If for an
s P Spβq, (3.3) does not occur, then we need not change the height of the tower ¯V psq,
i.e., the base is V psq and the height is hpsq :“ hpβq. If for an s P Spβq, (3.3) occurs, then
we do not change the base V psq and change the height hpsq :“ hpβq ` hpj, αq ´ 1 ´ i.
Then, f hpsq´1pV psqq Ď f hpj,αq´1pV pj, αqq is satisﬁed. We need not care for the diameters
of f ipV psqq for 0 ĺ i ă hpsq, because the extended part is a part of the tower that has the
base V pj, αq. The disjointness of f ipV psqq p0 ĺ i ă hpsqq is also obvious. Now, we cut oﬀ
the towers ¯V psq’s from each V pj, αq’s. Precisely, for each 1 ĺ j ĺ tα, we deﬁne V 1pj, αq :“
¯V psq.
V pj, αqz ŤsPSpβq
Now, we have a mutually disjoint towers t ¯V 1pj, αq | 1 ĺ j ĺ tα u Y t ¯V psq | s P Spβq u. We
note that for all s P Spβq, it follows that hpsq ľ hpβq ą L. We reorder these towers and
rewrite the bases V pj, βq p1 ĺ j ĺ tβq, the heights hpj, βq p1 ĺ j ĺ tβq, and the towers
¯V pj, βq, then Vβ “ Vα Y ¯V pβq. This
¯V pj, βq p1 ĺ j ĺ tβq. If we deﬁne Vβ :“ Ť1ĺjĺtβ
concludes the inductive step for α, completing the proof.

4. A Bratteli–Vershik representation
ϕ2ÐÝ G2

ϕ1ÐÝ G1

Let G : G0

ϕ3ÐÝ ¨ ¨ ¨ be a covering. We shall construct a Bratteli–Vershik
representation. To do this, we use the symbol p for the elements of E and say as a path,
i.e., a path p P E. For each n ľ 0, let Vn :“ t p | p P En u. Let v P Vn`1. Then, v is
a path p P En`1. Therefore, ϕEppq is a walk in Gn. We write as ϕEppq “ p1p2 ¨ ¨ ¨ pk.
Then, we make edges of a Bratteli diagram from each pi to v. These edges are denoted as
ei :“ ppi, v, iq p1 ĺ i ĺ kq. Thus, En`1 in a Bratteli diagram is deﬁne as En :“ t ppi, v, iq |
ϕEppq “ p1p2 ¨ ¨ ¨ pkppq, p P En`1, pi P Enp1 ĺ i ĺ kppqq u. The source maps speiq “ pi
p1 ĺ i ĺ kq and the target maps tpeiq “ v p1 ĺ i ĺ kq are deﬁned. The order of each edge
e “ pp, v, iq is i. In this way, we have constructed an ordered Bratteli diagram. We shall
deﬁne a Vershik map. In a Bratteli diagram, a path is a sequence pen, en`1, . . . , en`kq such
that each ei pn ĺ i ĺ n ` kq is an edge ei P Ei pn ĺ i ĺ n ` kq and tpeiq “ spei`1q for all
n ĺ i ă n ` k. Each En p1 ĺ nq is equipped with the discrete topology, and the space of
inﬁnite paths Y :“ t pe1, e2, . . . q | ei P Ei, tpeiq “ spei`1q for all i ľ 1 u is equipped with
the product topology. Because the Vershik map is deﬁned by the lexicographic order, we
have to deﬁne it only at the maximal paths. Let pe1, e2, . . . q P Y be an inﬁnite path that is
maximal. Nevertheless, by the `directionality of the weighted graph covering, it is clearly
deﬁned.
