Abstract

We study the dynamics of a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) segment, as a semiﬂexible polymer,

in a shear ﬂow, the strength of which is customarily expressed in terms of the dimensionless Weis-

senberg number Wi. Polymer chains in shear ﬂows are well-known to undergo tumbling motion.

When the chain lengths are much smaller than the persistence length, one expects a (semiﬂexible)

chain to tumble as a rigid rod. At low Wi, a polymer segment shorter than the persistence length

does indeed tumble as a rigid rod. However, for higher Wi the chain does not tumble as a rigid

rod, even if the polymer segment is shorter than the persistence length. In particular, from time to

time the polymer segment may assume a buckled form, a phenomenon commonly known as Euler

buckling. Using a bead-spring Hamiltonian model for extensible dsDNA fragments, we ﬁrst analyze

Euler buckling in terms of the oriented deterministic state (ODS), which is obtained as the steady-

state solution of the dynamical equations by turning oﬀ the stochastic (thermal) forces at a ﬁxed

orientation of the chain. The ODS exhibits symmetry breaking at a critical Weissenberg number

Wic, analogous to a pitchfork bifurcation in dynamical systems. We then follow up the analysis
with simulations and demonstrate symmetry breaking in computer experiments, characterized by a

unimodal to bimodal transformation of the probability distribution of the second Rouse mode with

increasing Wi. Our simulations reveal that shear can cause strong deformation for a chain that is

shorter than its persistence length, similar to recent experimental observations.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬂow properties of a solution of polymers have attracted the interest of physicists
for a long time. One side of the problem concerns how the concentration of dissolved
polymers inﬂuences e.g. the viscous (or viscoelastic) properties of the ﬂuid. The other side
concerns how ﬂuid ﬂow inﬂuences the behavior of polymers. Here we restrict ourselves to
the latter. Speciﬁcally, we consider a dilute solution of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
segments in water under shear. Double-stranded DNA is a semiﬂexible polymer, since it
preserves mechanical rigidity over a range, characterized by the persistence length lp ≈ 40
nm [1, 2], along its contour.

That a polymer will go through a “coil-stretch transition” under the inﬂuence of a shear
ﬂow was originally predicted by de Gennes [3], although it would be more than two decades
before the coil-stretch transition would be put to experimental veriﬁcation. Interestingly
however, the ﬁrst key experiment along this line — combining ﬂuid ﬂow and ﬂuorescence
microscopy techniques (the latter in order to visually track polymers) — was performed
to determine the force-extension curve of dsDNA, wherein uniform water ﬂow was used
to stretch (end-tethered) polymers [4]. Extending that experimental setup to include more
complicated ﬂow patterns, such as elongational ﬂow [5, 6] and shear ﬂow [7, 8] soon followed,
driven by the quest to understand how ﬂow-induced conformational changes take place in
polymers (see e.g., Ref. [9] for a review).

An intriguing by-product of the experiments with shear ﬂow was the tumbling motion
of the chains, which can be tracked by, e.g., the relative orientation of the polymer’s end-
to-end vector with respect to the direction of the ﬂow [7, 8]. Although irregular at short
time-scales, a tumbling frequency could be deﬁned based on the long-time statistics of the
chain’s orientation. The tumbling behavior soon started to receive further attention from
researchers: over the last decade and a half, a number of models have been constructed
[10–12] and further experiments have been performed [13–16] to characterize and quantify
the tumbling behavior, in particular the dependence of the tumbling frequency on the shear
strength. The subject of this paper, too, is tumbling behavior in a shear ﬂow, speciﬁcally
for a dsDNA chain that is smaller than its persistence length.

As stated earlier, the shear strength ˙γ is customarily expressed by the dimensionless
Weissenberg number Wi = ˙γτ, where τ is a characteristic time-scale for the polymer. At

3

one extreme, for ﬂexible polymers (polymer segments that are many times longer than their
persistence length, assuming coil conﬁgurations in the absence of shear), which many of
the above studies focus on, the natural choice for τ is the polymer’s terminal relaxation
time. For them there is good theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that the
tumbling frequency f scales with Wi as f ∝ Wi2/3 [10, 11, 13–15]. At the other extreme,
for semiﬂexible polymer segments (polymer segments shorter than their persistence lengths
resemble the conﬁguration of rigid rods in the absence of shear, and the natural choice of τ
is the time-scale for rotational diﬀusion of a rigid rod of the same length), one expects the
rigid rod result, namely that the tumbling frequency scales as f ∝ Wi2/3 [16–18]. (Given
that the physics of tumbling is diﬀerent for ﬂexible and semiﬂexible polymers, the similarity
in the scaling behavior of f is striking.)

Recently, Harasim et al.

[16] experimented with tumbling f-actin segments of several
lengths (∼ 3-40 µm) in a shear ﬂow. They found that the tumbling frequency f follows
the law f ∝ Wi2/3 for small Weissenberg numbers. A closer inspection of their data reveals
signiﬁcant deviations from the f ∝ Wi2/3 power-law around and above the persistence length
(≈ 16 µm). Images and movies out of the experiments have revealed that f-actin segments
of lengths smaller than the persistence length can strikingly buckle into J and U-shapes,
broadly known as Euler buckling.

These issues of buckling and the tumbling frequency were taken up by Lang et al. [12] by
an extensive modeling study, using the inextensible wormlike chain as Hamiltonian. They
discussed the tumbling frequency for the whole range spanning the two extremes, i.e., from
ﬂexible to semiﬂexible polymer segments, and reported, in the intermediate regime, the
dependence f ∝ Wi3/4.

The present paper has been inspired by the experiment of Harasim et al. [16]. Our focus
is to provide a quantitative characterization of the Euler buckling, and the corresponding
shapes of a tumbling semiﬂexible polymer segment in a shear ﬂow. To this end, we take
advantage of a recently developed bead-spring model for semiﬂexible polymers [19, 20] and
its highly eﬃcient implementation on a computer [21]. We model dsDNA segments dynamics
for lengths (cid:46) 20 nm, and analyze their dynamics in terms of the Rouse modes [22]. The
persistence length of dsDNA is ≈ 40 nm, corresponding to ≈ 120 beads with the average
intra-bead distance ≈ 0.33 nm, the length of a dsDNA basepair. We show that the tumbling
frequency adheres to the rigid rod results at low Wi and that for high Wi, semiﬂexible

4

polymer segments tumble much faster. This diﬀerence quickly leads us to issues related to
(Euler) buckling of the chain under the inﬂuence of shear. We ﬁrst analyze Euler buckling in
terms of the oriented deterministic state (ODS), which results from turning oﬀ the stochastic
(thermal) forces in polymer dynamics at a ﬁxed orientation of the chain. In this state the
internal forces, tending to keep the chain straight, balance the shear forces. Below a critical
Weissenberg number Wic, the ODS shows a slightly bend S-shape. Above Wic a symmetry
breaking takes place, analogous to pitchfork bifurcation, where the ODS strongly deviates
from a rigid rod.

We follow up the ODS analysis with simulations and demonstrate symmetry breaking in
computer experiments, and demonstrate that similar to the experimental snapshots found
for f-actin ﬁlaments in Ref. [16], shear can cause strong deformation, even for a chain that
is shorter than its persistence length.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the model. In Sec. III
we describe the polymer dynamics in terms of the Rouse modes. In Sec. IV we analyze
the time evolution of the orientation of the polymer, from which we determine the tumbling
frequency. In Sec. V we analyze Euler buckling, identify the critical Weissenberg number
Wic and solve for the shapes of the polymer in the ODS. We follow up the theory of Sec. V
with simulations in Sec. VI, and end the paper with a discussion in Sec. VII. A movie of
a tumbling dsDNA segment can be found in the ancillary ﬁles — details on the movie are
provided in Sec. VI.

II. THE MODEL

The Hamiltonian for our bead-spring model for semiﬂexible polymers, the details of which

can be found in our earlier works [19–21], reads

N(cid:88)

with stretching and bending parameters λ and κ respectively. Here un is the bond vector
between the (n − 1)-th and the n-th beads

un = rn − rn−1,

(2)

5

and rn is the position of the n-th bead (n = 0, 1, . . . , N). The parameter d provides a
length-scale, by the use of which we reduce the Hamiltonian to

with dimensionless ν = κ/λ and T ∗ = kBT /(λd2) parametrizing the Hamiltonian. In this
formulation the persistence length of the polymer is given by lp = (ν/T ∗)d/(1 − 2ν). The
model is a discrete version of the polymer with N discretization units (i.e., of length N).
From the analysis of the ground-state of the Hamiltonian (3) [19–21], each discretization
unit can be shown to have a length a = d/(1 − 2ν).

The parameters of the model — T ∗ and ν — are determined by matching to the force-
extension curve. For dsDNA, our semiﬂexible polymer of choice in this paper, we use a = 0.33
nm, the length of a dsDNA basepair, which leads to T ∗ = 0.034 and ν = 0.353, meaning
that one persistence length corresponds to N ≈ 120 [19–21].

III. POLYMER DYNAMICS

A. Construction of the Rouse modes modes

We analyze the dynamics of the polymer by its Rouse modes, since they turn out to be
a convenient scheme for solving the equations of motion with a sizable time step, without
introducing large errors [21].

The representation of the conﬁgurations of a polymer chain in terms of its ﬂuctuation

modes uses basis functions. The well-known Rouse modes employ the basis functions

The modes with p = 0 correspond to the location of the center-of-mass, the dynamics of
which can be rigorously separated from that of the other modes. We eliminate the center-
of-mass motion by always measuring the bead positions with respect to the center-of-mass.

6

B. The equations for the Rouse modes under shear

We consider the situation where water ﬂows in the ˆx-direction, with a shear gradient ˙γ
in the ˆy-direction. The Langevin equation for the motion of the bead position rn then reads

drn
dt

= −1
ξ

∂H
∂rn

+ ˙γ (yn − Ycm) ˆx + kn.

(6)

The Hamiltonian H is given in Eq. (1), and ξ is the friction coeﬃcient due to the viscous
drag, acting on each bead. The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of the equation represents
the internal force, which tends to keep the chain straight. The second term is the shear force
due to the ﬂow, where ˙γ is the shear rate, Ycm is the y co-ordinate of the center-of-mass of the
chain and yn is the y co-ordinate of monomer n. As mentioned earlier, we measure the bead
positions wrt the location of the chain’s center-of mass, leading to the term ∝ (yn − Ycm).
The last term in Eq. (6) gives the inﬂuence of the random thermal force kn, which has the
correlation function

(cid:104)kα

n (t) kβ

m(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = (2 kB T /ξ) δα,β δn,mδ(t − t(cid:48)).

In order to work with dimensionless units we replace the time t by

τ = λt/ξ.

(7)

(8)

The ratio ξ/λ then becomes the microscopic time scale, such that τ is dimensionless. In the
same spirit we combine the shear ratio ˙γ with this time scale leading to the dimensionless
constant g as the shear strength

g = ˙γ

ξ
λ

.

(9)

The shear strength is customarily expressed in terms of the Weissenberg number, which we
deﬁne as

Wi =

˙γ

2Dr

with

Dr =

kBT
Iξ

.

(10)

Here Dr is the rotational diﬀusion constant with I as the moment of inertia of the polymer
segment in its ground-state (of the Hamiltonian). The relation between the two dimension-
less quantities Wi and g is then given by

Wi = g

I0
2T ∗

(11)

where I0 = I/d2, the dimensionless moment of inertia of the polymer segment in the ground-
state.

Using the orthogonal transformation converting positions into modes the dynamic equa-

tions for the Rouse modes can be cast in the form [21]

dRp
dτ

= −ζpRp + Fp + Hp + Kp.

For the decay constant we use the expression

(12)

(13)

This spectrum follows from a subtraction in the coupling force Hp, which derives from the
contour length term in the Hamiltonian [21]

(14)

The subtraction 1−2ν within the last brackets changes the Rouse spectrum from longitudinal
to the transverse form Eq. (13). Finally, Fp is the shear force given by

Fp = g ˆx (ˆy · Rp).

The ﬂuctuating thermal force K α

p is the orthogonal transform of the kn in Eq. (7)

(cid:104)K α

q (τ(cid:48))(cid:105) = 2T ∗δα,β δp,q δ(τ − τ(cid:48)).

(15)

(16)

Although the Rouse modes turn out to be a convenient scheme for solving the equations
of motion with a sizable time step without large errors, we do pay a computational penalty
in the calculation of the coupling force, which requires a transformation (8) from the Rouse
modes to the bond vectors and the transformation (14) back to the modes. The penalty can
be kept to the minimum by the use the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to switch from modes
to bead positions; it keeps the number of operations of the order N log N.

C. Body-ﬁxed co-ordinate system to analyze tumbling dynamics

One of the major quantities of interest in the tumbling process is the dynamics of the
orientation of the polymer. The orientation can be deﬁned in several ways. The most

8

common one is the direction of the end-to-end vector. Since the ends of the chain ﬂuctuate
substantially over short time-scales, this is not a slow variable. We prefer to use as orientation
the direction of the ﬁrst Rouse mode R1, being the slowest decaying mode. We therefore
deﬁne the orientation ˆn of the polymer as

ˆn = ˆR1.

(17)

We refer to the components of the Rouse modes in the direction of ˆn as longitudinal com-
ponents

p = ˆn · Rp.
Rl

(18)

The perpendicular directions are transverse to ˆn. The ﬁrst Rouse mode has, by deﬁnition,
only a longitudinal component. In practice the so-deﬁned orientation does not diﬀer much
from the direction of the end-to-end vector.

Further, it is convenient to discuss the temporal behavior of the polymer not only in
the lab-frame co-ordinate system, with co-ordinate axes (ˆx, ˆy, ˆz), but also in the body-ﬁxed
co-ordinate system which we deﬁne as follows. Along with the unit vector ˆn, one of the two
transverse axes ˆn, is taken perpendicular to ˆn and ˆx, namely

ˆm = ˆn × ˆx/r,

r = [n2

y + n2

z]1/2.

(19)

The mode component in this direction, being perpendicular to ˆx, is not inﬂuenced by the
shear force. The other transverse direction is then naturally obtained as

ˆs = ˆm × ˆn.

(20)

Vector components along ˆs are maximally sheared. The system (ˆn, ˆs, ˆm) forms an orthogonal
basis set. For later use, below we list the Cartesian components of the vectors (ˆn, ˆs, ˆm):



nx = sin θ cos φ,

ny = sin θ sin φ,

nz = cos θ,

mx = 0,

sx = r,
sy = −nxny/r, my = nz/r,
sz = −nxnz/r, mz = −ny/r.

(21)

We denote the components of the modes generically with the index α, which alternatively
runs through α = (x, y, z) or α = (n, s, m).

IV. TIME EVOLUTION OF THE ORIENTATION OF THE POLYMER

The evolution of the orientation is given by the dynamics of the two transverse compo-

nents of R1

(22)

wherein the third equality follows from the fact that the transverse components of R1 vanish
by deﬁnition. So the temporal derivative of the longitudinal component is multiplied the
vanishing transverse component. We then use Eq. (12) and get

d ˆn
dτ

= g ˆx (ˆy · ˆn) + (H1 + K1)/Rl
1.

(23)

Obviously, in the right hand side of the equations only the transverse components of the
vectors are relevant.

For the interpretation of Eq. (23) we note that Rl

1 is closely related to the moment of

inertia I of the chain, which is deﬁned as

(cid:88)

(24)

where Ip is the contribution of the p-th Rouse mode to the moment of inertia. When the
chain is (relatively) straight, the sum over the modes is heavily dominated by the ﬁrst
component I1. So it is an indicative approximation to replace I by I1.

In the (relatively) straight state the conﬁguration of the chain resembles that of a straight
rod. In order to make a connection with the equation of tumbling for a rigid rod, we rewrite
the equation using a diﬀerent scaling of the time τ. We deﬁne the variable ˜τ, linked to the
Weissenberg number, as

˜τ = gτ /Wi,

with

g/Wi = 2T ∗/I1,

(25)

where we have used I1 as measure for the moment of inertia. In terms of ˜τ, Eq. (23) then
becomes

= Wi [ˆx (ˆy · ˆn)] + ( ˜H1 + ˜K1),

d ˆn

with ˜H1 and ˜G1 deﬁned as

˜H1 =

(cid:104) ˜K α

1 (˜τ ) ˜K β

1 (˜τ(cid:48))(cid:105) = δα,βδ(˜τ − ˜τ(cid:48)).

(28)

Apart from the mode-coupling term ˜H1, Eq. (26) is the same as that of an inﬁnitely thin
rigid rod [18]. Therefore it makes sense to compare the tumbling frequency f with that of
the rigid rod, given by [18]

f =

4π(1 + 0.65Wi2)1/6

Wi

.

(29)

For comparison we show in Fig. 1 the tumbling frequency of dsDNA chains for several
lengths shorter than the persistence length (which corresponds to N ≈ 120), as found from
simulations, together with that of a rigid rod expression, Eq. (29). The simulations have
been performed using an eﬃcient implementation of semiﬂexible polymer dynamics [21] of
the bead-spring model [19, 20]. At any given value of the Weissenberg number, obtained by
using the rotational inertia of a rigid rod that has the same conﬁguration as the ground-state
of the Hamiltonian (3), snapshots of the polymer have been used to calculate its orientation
[θ(t), φ(t)] in the laboratory frame. The φ(t) data is then ﬁtted by a straight line to obtain
the tumbling frequency.

FIG. 1: (color online) The tumbling frequency as a function of the Weissenberg number Wi for a

series of chain lengths N = 7, 15, 31 and 63. The conversion to Weissenberg numbers is based on

the ground-state moment of inertia, see Eq. (11).

range of Weissenberg numbers, clearly indicating that up to Wi = 100 the mode-coupling
force ˜H1 is unimportant. In order to see what this implies for the shear rate ˙γ, using the
expression I/d2 = N 3/12 for the moment of inertia, we write the relation between Wi and
the shear rate ˙γ as

Commercially available rheometers at present are limited to shear rates ˙γ < 106 s−1. This
implies, for dsDNA fragments of the order of the persistence length, say N = 100, that only
the range Wi < 2 is presently achievable in the lab; i.e., the diﬀerences from the rigid rod
behavior in Fig. 1 lie outside the reach of present day experiments. Nevertheless, the origin
of the deviations from the rigid rod behavior is theoretically interesting; we will address this
issue in the Sec. VI.

V. SHAPES OF SEMIFLEXIBLE POLYMER IN THE ORIENTED DETERMIN-

ISTIC STATE

In order to further analyze the tumbling process, it is useful to note that the orienta-
tion changes at a slower rate than all the other modes. This prompts us to focus on the
conﬁguration which is obtained as the steady- state solution of the dynamical equations by
turning oﬀ the stochastic (thermal) forces at a ﬁxed orientation of the chain. We call this
conﬁguration the oriented deterministic state (ODS). We use the properties of the ODS as
indicative for the conﬁgurations of the chain at the given orientation.

A. The approach to the oriented deterministic state (ODS)

The ODS conﬁguration of the chain is obtained from Eq. (12) by the decay of the equation

dRp
dτ

= −ζpRp + Fp + Hp.

(32)

The constraint of a ﬁxed orientation is imposed by leaving out the transverse components of
the mode R1 and setting them equal to zero in the other mode equations. Asymptotically

12

the conﬁguration obeying Eq. (32) will turn into the ODS. So for the ODS the l.h.s. of Eq.
(32) vanishes. The approach to the ODS conﬁguration as following from Eq. (32) is slow.
A further simpliﬁcation of ﬁnding the asymptotic state of Eq. (32) follows by considering
the ODS in the body-ﬁxed system. As there are no shear forces in the ˆm direction, the ODS
shape has no component in that direction. For the two other equations in the (ˆn, ˆs) plane
we get in detail

(33)

For p = 1 we have only the ﬁrst equation since the second refers to the transverse component
1, which we keep equal to zero. Solving this set of non-linear equations is delicate. We
Rs
found that, under normal circumstances, iteration is a stable and quick way to the solution.
For a given orientation of the chain, we start with an arbitrary conﬁguration (in fact, for the
starting conﬁguration, we use the ground-state conﬁguration of the chain [19, 20]). We then
compute the coupling forces H n
p and Rs
p for the
and construct a new set of bond vectors. We repeat the calculation of H n
new conﬁguration and continue the process until the iterative process converges. Iteration
leads faster to the ODS than the evolution of the equations Eq. (32). The results of the two
approaches, in any case, coincide.

B. Symmetry breaking in the oriented deterministic state

The iterative solution of Eq. (33), as well as the decay towards the ODS on the basis
of Eq. (32), reveals an interesting phenomenon. To show this, we note that conﬁgurations
that are invariant under reversal of the chain have vanishing even Rouse modes. It is easy
to see that the equations (33) preserve this symmetry under iteration. The bond vectors un
changes sign under the operation

n ↔ N − n.

(34)
Changing the summation variable from n to N − n in the deﬁnition Eq. (14) of the coupling
force shows that Hp changes sign for even p, but not for odd p. This means that if we start
the iteration with a conﬁguration that is invariant under reversal, i.e., we start the iteration
with only odd Hp on the rhs of Eq. (33), it leads to a solution that has, once again, only

13

odd Rouse mode components.

The above does not however exclude that there are solutions which break the reversal
symmetry. The best way to solve for the ODS is to therefore start the iteration with a
conﬁguration with a (perturbatively) small even mode, e.g. R2. The perturbation may
grow or decrease under successive iterations. We ﬁnd that for low Weissenberg numbers the

2 in Eq. (33)

ζp − gsxsy = ζp + g(sin θ)2 sin φ cos φ

(35)

reaches its smallest value for θ = π/2 and φ = 3π/4, thus leading to the largest value of Rs
2
in the case of symmetry breaking.

From Fig. 2 we see that the critical Weissenberg number for θ = π/2 and φ = 3π/4

equals Wic ≈ 19.4 for a dsDNA chain of length N = 63.

C. Shapes of the chain and Euler buckling

The shape of the chain depends on its orientation of the polymer, which comes into the
solution through the components of the axes ˆn and ˆs. The shear is most eﬀective in the x-y
plane, i.e., for θ = π/2. In Fig. 3(a), for N = 63, we show the value of |Rs
4| as a
function of φ in the neighborhood of the most eﬀective value φ = 3π/4 for Wi= 21.3 and
θ = π/2 (note: Wic ≈ 19.4). The non-zero value of |Rs
p| disappears at φ = 3π/4 when Wi
approaches Wic from above.

2| and |Rs

Further, in order to see the magnitude of the eﬀect we plot in Fig. 3(b) the behavior of
the end-to-end distance of the chain for N = 63 as a function of φ for θ = π/2 and for some
values of Wi around the critical Weissenberg number Wic. One observes that the end-to-end
distance varies only slightly as a function of orientation below Wic. Above the Wic a large
dip develops around φ = 3π/4, demonstrating that the symmetry breaking goes hand-in-
hand with the so-called Euler buckling of the chain, i.e., the chain folds, which reduces its
end-to-end distance.

In order to visually appeal the reader to Euler buckling, we provide a number of snapshots
of the chain in the ODS for N = 63 and Wi = 100, conﬁned to the x-y plane in Fig. 4. This
large Weissenberg number is well above Wic. The region of φ within π/2 < φ ≤ π is the

15

interesting region, for which we plot the polymer conﬁgurations.

FIG. 4: Shapes of the dsDNA chain of length N = 63 at Wi= 100, demonstrating Euler buckling in
the ODS. The shapes are shown on the x-y plane (i.e., θ = π/2) for 0.6π ≤ φ < π. In the direction
of the arrow the shapes correspond to φ = 0.60π, 0.65π, 0.70π, 0.75π, 0.80π, 0.85π, 0.90π and 0.95π

respectively. Interestingly, the orientation here deﬁned by the ﬁrst Rouse mode corresponds closely

to the direction of the end-to-end vector.

To conclude: the ODS conﬁguration of the chain resembles a rigid rod below a critical
value Wic of the Weissenberg number. Above this critical value, even though the length of
the chain is only about half as that of the persistence length, it breaks the reversal symmetry,
much like the classic case of a pitchfork bifurcation. This leads to the development of a
region around θ = π/2 and φ = 3π/4, where the chain (Euler) buckles. The buckling gives
a large dip in the end-to-end distance.

Finally we note that the critical Wic depends on the length N of the chain (roughly
inversely proportional) and on ν (decreasing with ν). Converting it to a critical shear rate
˙γc involves also T ∗ [see Eq. (25)].

Before we discuss the details of the simulation results, we make the readers aware of
the diﬀerences between the ODS in Sec. V and the simulations. Thermal noise plays no
role in the ODS while in simulations it does. This implies that although for Wi < Wic the
amplitude of Rs
2 is identically zero in the ODS, we should not expect to ﬁnd the same in
simulations at low Wi-values, since in simulations the second Rouse mode will always be
kicked up by noise. This calls into question the relevance of the ODS for simulations — in
particular, whether the tumbling of the chain is suﬃciently slow such that the simulation
can explore the neighborhood of the ODS, and thereby follow the characteristics of the ODS.
In view of lack of clarity for an answer to this question we used the ODS as a guide for the
simulations: to be more precise, we focused on the values of Wi in the range 10 ≤ Wi ≤ 100

17

for N = 63 and sampled the probability distribution of Rs

2 as function of the orientation.

In simulations for dsDNA of length N = 63 we recorded 16 million consecutive snapshots
of the chain at regular intervals, R1 (for determining the orientation of the chain) and R2, at
equal intervals of time, for several values of Wi. The angles (θ, φ) for the chain’s orientation
are determined from the values of R1. We then selected out the snapshots in this slice
|θ − π/2| = 0.1 radians, leaving us with 2-3 million snapshots dependent on the value of Wi.

In Fig. 5 we show the corresponding scatterplots of Rs
values of Wi. In between the solid lines, representing 0.35π < φ < 3π/4, we see two lobes of
empty regions developing, signaling that the probability distribution P (Rs
2 for these
values of φ changes with increasing Wi. We note that the values of φ corresponding to the
two solid lines in Fig. 5 are chosen solely by visual inspection, and that the locations of the
empty lobes are shifted wrt the region in φ, for which the ODS exhibits Euler buckling.

and shown in Fig. 6(b). The Binder cumulant, originally introduced to study symmetry
breaking, attains the value zero when the probability distribution is Gaussian, and reaches
the value 2/3 when the symmetry is fully broken, changing the probability distribution into
a combination of two symmetric δ-peaks. For the data in Fig. 6(a) we see that the value of
B changes from ≈ 0.3 at Wi = 10 to ≈ 0.53 at Wi = 100.

The symmetry breaking is certainly not conﬁned to N = 63. The same analysis on the
simulation data (again, all data points within |θ−π/2| = 0.1 and 0.35π < φ < 3π/4, with the
corresponding ﬁgures, analogous to Fig. 6, presented in Fig. 7) reveals symmetry breaking
taking place also for N = 31.

We note that the center of the region where the symmetry breaking takes place is around
the values of φ ≈ 0.55π as can be observed from the scatterplots. This is substantially

The chain tumbles in the direction from φ = π towards φ = 0. So the buckling in the
simulation lags behind with respect to the ODS. This is likely the result of the slowness by
which the buckled state is formed and is broken down. Using Eq. (32) we estimated the

time ∆τ, needed to evolve from the ground-state (in which the transverse R2
of its asymptotic value (the ODS), to be of the order ∆τ (cid:39) 106. This translates to a time
∆˜τ ≈ 0.3 [see Eq. (25)]. In order to put this estimate in perspective, we compare it with
the tumbling period 1/f of the rigid rod, which is 1.7 for Wi=20 according to Eq. (29).
In other words, the chain indeed travels a sizable fraction of the period in the building-up
phase of the buckling, the more so since it rotates faster for the buckling orientations than
in the position aligned with the ﬂow.

Thus, to summarize this section: using the theoretical analysis of symmetry breaking
2 by simulations of a
as a guide we have computed the probability distribution P (Rs
tumbling dsDNA segment of length N = 63 and N = 31. The simulation data has con-
ﬁrmed that symmetry breaking takes place, showing up as the transition from an unimodal
probability distribution P (Rs
2 at Wi = 10 transforming into a bimodal distribution
symmetric around Rs

2 = 0, as well as the associated Binder cumulants.

To supplement the above analysis of the simulation data we show, in Fig. 8, two simulation
snapshots of a tumbling dsDNA chain of length N = 63 at Wi = 100, projected on the x-y
plane, in order to showcase that, akin to the experimental snapshots shown for f-actin in Ref.

length. A movie of this tumbling chain (that includes both conﬁgurations of Fig. 8) can be
found in the ancillary ﬁles. In the movie the center-of-mass of the chain always remains at
the origin of the co-ordinate system. The movie contains 3,000 snapshots, with consecutive
snapshots being ∆τ = 560 apart in time. With ∆τ = 1 representing 0.16 ps [21], the full
duration of the movie spans ≈ 2.7 µs in real time.

VII. CONCLUSION

Our study focuses on fragments dsDNA, which are fairly extensible semiﬂexible poly-
mers. The extensibility of dsDNA implies parameters in our Hamiltonian, which admit
mode dynamics with a large time step. The usual workhorse for theoretical studies is the
inextensible wormlike chain model for the Hamiltonian, the computer implementation of
which is conﬁned to signiﬁcantly smaller time steps.

Our simulations of a semiﬂexible polymer (dsDNA fragments smaller than the persistence
length) show that their tumbling frequency is given, for the accessible range of Weissenberg
numbers (Wi<2), by the thin rigid-rod formula. Deviations of the tumbling frequency from
this formula (Fig. (1)) occur at higher Weissenberg numbers. It is theoretically interesting
to speculate about the nature of the deviations from the rigid-rod formula, also in view of
the observation that the accessible range of Weissenberg numbers is much larger for stiﬀer
and longer polymers, e.g. f-actin. The Weissenberg number for a polymer chain is a product
of the shear rate ˙γ and the rotational diﬀusion time-scale of a rigid rod of the same length as
the chain, i.e., L. Consequently, the Weissenberg number ∝ ˙γL3. One persistence length of f-
actin is about 200 times longer than one persistence length of dsDNA. In units of persistence
length, for the same shear rate one thus reaches orders of magnitude higher Weissenberg
numbers for f-actin than for dsDNA.

In this respect we note that the Wi2/3 law for rigid thin rods originates from a singularity
that develops in the probability distribution for the orientation in the points θ = π/2 and
φ = 0 or π [18]. The reason is that a thin rigid rod does not feel a torque from the shear in
the aligned orientation and only a ﬂuctuation can pull the rod over this stagnation point. A
semiﬂexible polymer, however, always feels a torque due to ﬂuctuations of the other modes
(either thermal or buckling), which communicate with the orientation through the coupling

21

force H1. These ﬂuctuations enable Jeﬀery-like orbits which are characteristic for ellipsoids
with a ﬁnite aspect ratio in the moments of inertia [23]. The deviations from the thin rigid
rod formula that we see in Fig. (1) do not substantiate the f ∝ Wi3/4 law reported for
inextensible wormlike chains [12].

Using our Hamiltonian we have made a quantitative analysis of the phenomenon of Euler
buckling. Fixing the orientation and searching for the conﬁguration which results by turning
oﬀ the thermal noise, yields the oriented deterministic state (ODS). In the ODS we see a
sharply deﬁned critical Wic above which the buckling occurs.
It is a form of symmetry
breaking through the occurrence of even modes in the ODS above Wic.

In the simulations we observe correspondingly a transition in the probability distribution
2, changing gradually from a unimodal distribution to a
for the even modes, in particular Rs
bimodal distribution. The simulations show that the formation of the buckled state is a slow
process. Therefore the orientation where the two peaks in the bimodal are most signiﬁcant,
lags behind the orientation where the ODS gives the maximum buckling. The buckling is
substantiated by characteristic conﬁgurations and a movie of the tumbling process.
