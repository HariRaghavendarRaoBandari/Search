We present an open geometry Fourier modal method based on a new combination of open bound-
ary conditions and an eﬃcient k-space discretization. The open boundary of the computational do-
main is obtained using basis functions that expand the whole space, and the integrals subsequently
appearing due to the continuous nature of the radiation modes are handled using a discretization
based on non-uniform sampling of the k-space. We apply the method to a variety of photonic struc-
tures and demonstrate that our method leads to signiﬁcantly improved convergence with respect to
the number of degrees of freedom, which may pave the way for more accurate and eﬃcient modeling
of open nanophotonic structures.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Many important properties of photonic structures, like
cavities [1] and waveguides [2, 3], depend on their ra-
diative losses that stem from coupling of energy into
freely propagating optical modes that escape the sys-
tem. The quality, or Q, factor of photonic resonators as
well as the spontaneous emission (SE) β factor in waveg-
uides are important ﬁgures of merit, for example in the
analysis of nanolasers [4] and single-photon sources [5],
and these quantities depend sensitively on the radiative
losses.
In modeling such open photonic systems, the
choice of boundary conditions (BCs) at the computa-
tional domain edges becomes crucial and may impact the
results not just quantitatively, but also qualitatively. In-
tegral equation-Green’s function formulations inherently
adopt this openness [6], while for numerical techniques
relying on ﬁnite-sized computational domains, like the
ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) method [7] and the
ﬁnite element method (FEM) [8], this is achieved using
artiﬁcial absorbing boundaries, typically in the form of
so-called perfectly matched layers (PMLs) [9].

In Fourier-based modal expansion techniques [10, 11],
PMLs can be implemented using complex coordinate
transforms [12]. The absorbing boundaries are imple-
mented by mapping the real spatial coordinates into com-
plex ones, which is straightforward to implement.
In
turn, it is unclear which complex coordinate transform
to implement and why, and there have been no system-
atic studies on the inﬂuence of PML parameters and the
size of the computational domain on computed quantities
of interest. In addition to Fourier resolution convergence
checks, the size of the computational domain should be
varied to estimate the computational accuracy, but this
is rarely done [13–15]. In our experience, diﬀerent choices
of PML parameters and domain sizes lead to results that
agree qualitatively, but that may vary substantially, for

example, the errors of Q factors ∼ 20% [13] and the er-
rors of dipole coupling to radiation modes ∼ 15 − 25%
[16] have been reported.
Instead of searching an extremely large PML pa-
rameter space without intuitive or clear guidelines, we
here propose a diﬀerent technique that relies on ﬁnite-
sized structures and open BCs, with ﬁelds expanded via
Fourier integrals instead of Fourier series. The use of
Fourier integrals, in principle, gives an exact description,
but for numerical implementation a k-space discretiza-
tion is required, that we, however, have the freedom
to choose. Similar ideas have previously been reported
for two-dimensional (2D) [17] and rotationally symmet-
ric three-dimensional (3D) [18–20] structures, but with-
out discussion of the important problem of choosing the
k-space discretization. Furthermore, the important ex-
ample of dipole emission, that depends sensitively on the
proper implementation of the open BCs, was not treated
in these works. In this manuscript, we address both these
central issues. Our examples include calculations of light
emission from emitters placed in rotationally symmetric
waveguides [21] and reﬂection of the fundamental mode
from a waveguide-metal interface [22]. We term this new
approach open geometry Fourier modal method (oFMM).
This manuscript is organized as follows. Section II
outlines the theory of the oFMM approach while the de-
tails are given in appendix A. The details of the new dis-
cretization scheme is discussed in Sec. III. The method
is tested in several structures by calculating dipole emis-
sion rates, β factors and modal reﬂection coeﬃcients in
Sec. IV.

II. THEORY

In this section we outline the derivation of the open
BC formalism and introduce the theoretical concepts re-
quired to understand the results of the following sections.
The detailed derivations of the open BCs formalisms in
rotationally symmetric geometry is given in appendix A.

A. Open boundary condition formalism

We employ the open BCs formalism to describe the
electromagnetic ﬁeld propagation in rotationally sym-
metric structures. Complete vectorial description is used
in connection with Fourier expansion to describe the
Maxwell’s equations in a z-invariant material section.
Using cylindrical coordinates in the rotationally symmet-
ric case allows for simpliﬁcation of the problem to 1D
expansion in the radial coordinate. The z-dependence is
treated by combining z-invariant sections using the scat-
tering matrix formalism (see, e.g., [23] and [24] for de-
tails). Our task is then to determine the lateral electric
and magnetic ﬁeld components of the eigenmodes, which
are subsequently used as an expansion basis for the op-
tical ﬁeld. In the conventional FMM, this is done by ex-
panding the ﬁeld components as well as the permittivity
ε(r⊥) and η(r⊥) ≡ 1/ε(r⊥) in Fourier series in the lateral
coordinates r⊥ on a ﬁnite-sized computational domain,
implying that these functions vary periodically in these
coordinates. In the open boundary formalism, we instead
consider an inﬁnite-sized computational domain and em-
ploy expansions in Fourier integrals. Our approach de-
scribing rotationally symmetric structures uses the Bessel
J-functions as basis functions, as ﬁrst proposed in [18]. In
the following, we describe the general steps and equations
required to expand the ﬁeld components and to solve for
the expansion and propagation coeﬃcients. The speciﬁc
equations and derivations are given in the appendix and
referenced throughout this section.

Starting from the time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations
∇×E(r) = iωµ0H(r) and ∇×H(r) = −iωε(r)E(r) (writ-
ten using cylindrical coordinates in Eqs. (A1)–(A6) in
the appendix), where ε is the permittivity of the medium,
µ0 is the vacuum permeability, ω is the angular frequency
and E and H the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, we obtain

∇ × [∇ × E(r)] = ω2µ0ε(r)E(r),

(1)

which is given in cylindrical coordinates in Eqs. (A7)–
(A9). The ﬁelds in single z-invariant section can be ex-
panded using the eigenmodes of the system as

E(r⊥, z) =Xj

ajEj(r⊥) exp(±iβjz)

+Z a(k)E(k, r⊥) exp(±iβ(k)z)dk,

(2)

where βj and β(k) denote the propagation constants, and
aj and a(k) the weights of the corresponding modes. Fur-
thermore, the summation index j denotes all the guided
modes while the integral accounts for the radiation and
evanescent modes. In numerical simulations the contin-
uous integral is approximated by a sum as

Z a(k)E(k, r⊥) exp(±iβ(k)z)dk
≈Xl

alEj(kl, r⊥) exp(±iβlz)∆kl,

(3)

2

where ∆kl = kl − kl−1 and kl = p(nk0)2 − β2

l , with
k0 denoting the wavenumber in vacuum and n being the
refractive index of the material. Similar equations hold
for the magnetic ﬁeld.

Using the discretized eigenfunction expansion in Eqs.
(2)–(3), the ﬁelds in each z-invariant section can be ex-
pressed with column vectors a consisting of electric and
magnetic ﬁeld expansion coeﬃcients, [aj, al∆kl]T, all de-
noted with the single index j in the following. Thus,
taking the z derivative of Eq. (2) we can formulate an
eigenvalue problem describing the ﬁelds in the system as

Ma = iβa,

(4)

where the elements of matrix M are obtained by expand-
ing the eigenfunction in Fourier-Bessel basis in rotation-
ally symmetric geometry as discussed below.

Since the eigenfunctions are speciﬁc to each layer, we
choose a general basis and expand the eigenfunctions in
each layer using the common basis. Thus any function
(the ﬁeld components and the relative permittivity) can
be expanded as a Fourier transform

f (r⊥) =Zk⊥

cf (k⊥)g(k⊥, r⊥)dk⊥,

(5)

where k⊥ is transverse wavenumber while cf (k⊥) and
g(k⊥, r⊥) are the expansion coeﬃcients and the basis
functions.
In the rotationally symmetric case k⊥ = kr
and r⊥ = r, and the basis functions g(kr, r) are the
Bessel J-functions (cf. Eqs.
(A15)–(A16)). While in
the analytical deﬁnition of the Fourier transform the ex-
pansion basis in integral (5) is inﬁnite, for the numerical
calculations the basis must be truncated as

Zk⊥
MXm=1

≃

cf (k⊥)g(k⊥, r⊥)dk⊥

cf (k⊥,m)g(k⊥,m, r⊥)∆k⊥,m,

(6)

where the discretization steps ∆k⊥,m will be a function
of the index m in the generalized approach as will be
discussed in section III. This is in contrast to previous
approaches [17, 18], and we show later that such a non-
uniform discretization is a signiﬁcant improvement. The
expansions in cylindrical coordinate system are given by
Eqs. (A15)–(A16). Furthermore, the elements of M are
given in Eqs. (A23)–(A26). Solving the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues of matrix M yields the expansion coeﬃcients
and propagation constants in the z-invariant structures,
while the ﬁelds in the full structure are then obtained by
combining the z-invariant sections using the scattering
matrix formalism.

B. Dipole emission

The ﬁeld emitted by a point dipole placed at rpd inside

a z-invariant structure can be represented as

aj(rpd, p)Ej(r)

E(r) =Xj
=Xj Xm

ajcj,mgm(r)∆k⊥,me±iβj(z−zpd),

(7)

where Ej(r) is the electric ﬁeld of jth eigenmode, and
aj(rpd, p) is the dipole coupling coeﬃcient to mode j,
which can be calculated using the Lorentz reciprocity
theorem [24]. The coupling coeﬃcient depends on the
dipole position rpd and dipole moment p through a dot-
product p · Ej(rpd). For the sake of notational clarity
we we omit these dependencies in the following. Further-
more, cj,m are the expansion coeﬃcients for mode j, and
gm(r⊥) are the basis functions.

The emitted ﬁeld (7) consists of three contributions
[25]: guided modes, radiating modes, and evanescent
modes. In a waveguide surrounded by air, the modes are
guided if the propagation constant βj obeys k2
j ≤
(nwk0)2, where nw is the refractive index of the waveg-
uide. In contrast the modes are radiating if 0 < β2
j ≤ k2
0,
and evanescent if β2
j < 0. We will apply this classiﬁcation
in section III when we investigate discretization schemes.
The normalized power emitted by dipole to a selected

0 < β2

mode can be expressed as [24, 26]

Pj

Im{ajEj(rpd)}

PBulk

(8)

where PBulk is the emitted power in a bulk medium.
The normalized emitted power is equal to the normal-
ized emission rate [26] γj/γBulk = Pj/PBulk, where γj
and γBulk are the emission rates to mode j and in a bulk,
respectively. In the following we will use only the nor-
malized unitless quantity Γj = γj/γBulk for the emission
rate. Thus, the spontaneous emission factor (i.e. the β
factor), deﬁned as the ratio of emission to the fundamen-
tal mode (FM) and the total emission [21], is obtained
as

III. DISCRETIZATION SCHEME

In addition to the open BCs described in the previous
section, an advantage of the presented method is that it
enables using a non-uniform k-space discretization, which
allows having a high cut-oﬀ value together with dense
sampling k-space regions and still maintaining moderate

3

total number of modes, i.e. achieving the required accu-
racy with less computational power. In this section, we
investigate how to select the cutoﬀ value kcut−oﬀ and how
to sample the k-space eﬀectively. The numerical tests in
section IV show that faster convergence is achieved using
an appropriate mode sampling scheme.

The transverse wavenumber values in the conventional
modal expansion approach [10] are selected equidistantly

km = m∆k =

m

M + 1

kcut−oﬀ ,

(10)

where m = 1 . . . M and the discretization step size de-
pends on the selected cut-oﬀ value kcut−oﬀ and number
of modes M as ∆k = kcut−oﬀ/(M + 1).

FIG. 1. Non-uniform discretization scheme: In a bulk medium
all propagation directions have equal weights. Therefore, the
wavevector k is sampled in the (β, k⊥)-plane using equidistant
angles as shown by θ in the ﬁgure. Due to the uniform angle
distribution, the k⊥ discretization is more dense close to nk0.

In bulk, light emission occurs with equal weights in
all directions. Therefore, a natural starting point for the
discretization scheme is to sample the wavevectors in the
(β, k⊥) plane with equidistant angles [27], as shown in
Fig. 1. Then the diﬀerent transverse wavenumber values
are given by km = nk0 sin(θm), where the equidistantly
sampled angles 0 < θm < π/2 are measured from the β
axis. Although the values of θm are selected uniformly,
the values of km are more densely sampled in the prox-
imity of nk0, cf. Fig. 1. If, instead of a bulk, we consider
a structure like a nanowire consisting of several materials
it is necessary also to account for the modes beyond nk0.
To obtain insight into the discretization in diﬀerent
types of structures, we ﬁrst investigate emission from a
radially oriented point dipole placed on the axis of rota-
tionally symmetric inﬁnite semiconductor nanowires hav-
ing radius from sub-wavelength to several wavelengths
and a refractive index nw, see Fig 2. The radial compo-

nent of the emitted electric ﬁeld Er(r) =Pj ajEr,j(r) =
Pj ajPm cmgr,m(r)∆km can be written as follows (cf.

Sec. II II B, Eqs. (6) and (7) and Appendix A) by rear-

for the radial component of the electric ﬁeld deﬁned in
Eq. (A15). The sum over j describes the modes of the
structure, while index m accounts for the expansion of
the modes using the selected basis functions. The ﬁrst
summation inside the brackets in Eq.

j ≤ (nwk0)2) contribution,
the guided mode (k2

and radiation mode contribution and the their sum as
functions of radial wavenumber. The emitted electric
ﬁeld has a peak around km = k0. When the radius
increases, also a peak around km = nwk0 gradually
builds up, while in the bulk limit (r/λ ≫ 1) the peak
around k0 disappears. These results indicate that (i)
for wires with radius r <
∼ λ the k-space should be
densely sampled around k0, (ii) for wider structures
dense sampling around nwk0 is also required, while (iii)
in bulk dense sampling is required only around nwk0.
Thus, since we are mainly interested in the region where
the wire radius is of the order of or smaller than the
wavelength, we will use the following discretization
scheme that is dense and symmetric around k0 and
where the discretization step-size gradually increases
towards the cut-oﬀ value. Let M1, M2, M3 be the ﬁxed
number of k values on the intervals (0, k0), (k0, 2k0), and
(2k0, kcut−oﬀ), respectively. Then we can write

where we use a symmetric dense sampling around k0
by setting M2 = M1. Furthermore, δ1 = ∆k(2)
is

then biggest step size in the symmetric region, and
δ2 = 2[kcut−oﬀ − k(2)
M2 − M3δ1]/[M3(M3 + 1)]. When mod-
eling bulk materials, k0 will be multiplied with the refrac-
tive index as concluded above. In the following we will
use M1 = M2 = M3 = M/3. The optimal values of Mi
may vary depending on the geometry, but this choice lim-
its the number of free parameters to the total number of
modes M and to the cut-oﬀ value kcut−oﬀ . Our examples
will show that this selection leads to faster convergence of
the calculations than using the equidistant discretization
scheme.

In the next section, we use these discretization schemes
in modeling of various structures and compare the con-
vergence and required computational power with those
obtained using conventional discretization scheme. When
comparing the diﬀerent discretization schemes, we use
the same cut-oﬀ value and the same number of modes
for both of the schemes.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

Next, after introducing the principles of open BC for-
malism together with the new discretization strategy, we
are ready to test the method with several numerical ex-
amples. The purpose of these selected examples is to
show that the calculations using oFMM formalism con-

verge towards a well-deﬁned open geometry limit and
that faster convergence can be achieved using the dis-
cretization schemes introduced in Sec. III compared to
using the conventional equidistant discretization. We
start with calculating the dipole emission rates (or emis-
sion power) in bulk and close to an interface since these
results can be veriﬁed analytically. After these basic
checks, we investigate the performance of our method for
the cases of light emission from emitters in waveguides
as well as the case of reﬂection at a waveguide-metal in-
terface, all of which depend critically on a correct and
accurate description of the open boundaries.

A. Dipole emission in bulk and close to an interface

As a ﬁrst example, we consider dipole emission in bulk
and close to a bulk-bulk interface. Both of these ex-
amples can also be solved analytically [26, 28] allowing
easy comparison of the convergence of the results. Fig-
ure 3(a) shows the dipole emission power in a bulk mate-
rial (nb = 1) calculated using the rotationally symmetric
model and normalized with the analytical result. Numer-
ical results are calculated using both the equidistant dis-
cretization and the non-uniform discretization presented
in Sec. III. The obtained results show that applying the
non-uniform discretization leads to much faster conver-
gence of the emission rates.

In the bulk case, only propagating modes contribute to

FIG. 2. The Fourier components of a point dipole emission
deﬁned in Eq. (11). The ﬁgures show the calculated radia-
tion and guided mode contributions and the total emission as
function of the radial wave number in z-invariant nanowires
of varying radius. The nanowire has a refractive index of
nw = 3.5 and the wavelength is λ = 950 nm. An equidistant
k-discretization with 1500 points and kmax = 10k0 was used.

the light emission and the emission rate converges pro-
vided that enough propagating modes are included in the
calculation. In contrast, in the case of a dipole emitter in
close proximity of an interface also the evanescent modes
contribute through evanescent mode scattering at the in-
terface and re-excitation of the propagating modes. As
a next example we, therefore, investigate the interface
case.

Figure 3(b) shows the power emitted by a dipole close
to an air-glass interface while Fig. 3(c) shows that for
a dipole close to an air-metal interface. The values of
the metal and glass permittivities are ε = −41 + 2.5i and
ε = 2.25, respectively. In contrast to the bulk case in Fig.
3(a) where the cut-oﬀ was nbk0 (nb = 1), we now need to
include the evanescent modes. Figures 3(b) and (c) show
the separate contributions from propagating and evanes-
cent modes to the emission rate. Again, the non-uniform
discretization leads to faster convergence, especially for
the contribution from the evanescent modes.

B. Dipole emitter in a rotationally symmetric

waveguide

Next we investigate the emission in waveguides by cal-
culating the emission rates to selected modes and the
spontaneous emission factor β. In contrast to the bulk
and interface cases investigated in the previous section,
we face an additional computational challenge which is to
compute the radiating modes accurately. The waveguides
considered in nanophotonics usually support only a few

guided modes. However, the total emission rate and thus
the β factor depend on emission to continuum of radia-
tion modes that can radiate light out of the waveguide.
Calculating the radiation modes accurately requires more
extensive calculations than the emission on bulk as will
be seen in the following examples.

Similar to calculations represented in [21], we consider
a dipole emitter oriented along the wire axis in an in-
ﬁnitely long nanowire with nw = 3.45 and surrounded
by air. Figure 4(a) presents the β factor and the emis-
sion rates to the fundamental guided mode (HE11), to
the second guided mode (HE12), and to the radiation
modes, all normalized to the bulk emission rate (see Sec.
II II B) as functions of the nanowire diameter. While the
rates calculated using both the equidistant and the non-

uniform discretization schemes with 1200 modes and a
cut-oﬀ value 25k0 agree well qualitatively, discrepancies
are observed in the emission rate to radiation modes. Fig-
ure 4(b) shows a convergence investigation of the emis-
sion rate to radiation modes. We ﬁx the nanowire geom-
etry by setting the diameter as 0.3λ, use both discretiza-
tion schemes, and vary the cutoﬀ value of the transverse
wavenumber as well as the number of modes. The results
show that only a slight improvement is achieved by in-
creasing the cutoﬀ from 20k0 to 25k0, while the results
depend on the number of modes for small mode numbers
and converge around 500. At high mode numbers and
cut-oﬀ values the results converge to the same value.

sent the results obtained using equidistant discretization while

tion.

C. Reﬂection from semiconductor nanowire metal

interface

Finally, we investigate convergence of the method in
a structure consisting of a nanowire standing on top of
a metallic bulk layer. We calculate the reﬂection coef-
ﬁcient of the fundamental mode from a nanowire-metal
interface similar to the setup investigated in [22]. The re-
fractive indices of the nanowire and metal are nw = 3.5

6

and nAg = √−41 + 2.5i at the wavelength λ = 950 nm.

Figure 5 shows the calculated reﬂection coeﬃcient as
a function of the nanowire diameter using both (a) the
equidistant sampling of the k⊥ and (b) the nonuniform
k⊥ discretization with several diﬀerent number of dis-
cretization modes. In the non-uniform discretization, the
k-space values are sampled more densely close to k0 as
discussed in Sec. III. With small wire diameter the re-
ﬂection coeﬃcients are essentially determined by the air-
metal reﬂection (RAir−Ag ≈ 0.98) since in this limit the
fundamental mode is mainly located in air. In contrast,
in the limit of large nanowires the fundamental mode is
primarily located into the GaAs wire (RGaAs−Ag ≈ 0.95).
Nevertheless, the ﬁgures show that faster convergence is
obtained using the non-uniform discretization scheme in-
stead of the equidistant k discretization.

The reﬂection coeﬃcients in Figs. 5(a) and (b) are
obtained for a ﬁxed cut-oﬀ value. Next, we ﬁx the geom-
etry and study the eﬀect of the cut-oﬀ value of km. We
select a wire having diameter of 0.22λ since the reﬂec-
tion coeﬃcients shown in the Fig. 5(a)–(b) calculated
with diﬀerent discretization schemes and with varying
number of modes have large variations around this di-
ameter. Reﬂection coeﬃcients as functions of the cut-oﬀ
value calculated using both discretization schemes with
several diﬀerent numbers of included modes are shown in
Fig. 5(c). The km values are chosen such that when the
cut-oﬀ is increased extra points are added to the original
km grid. The results show that the calculations converge
around 5nwk0.

The convergence checks in the selected waveguide ex-
amples represented in Figs. 4 and 5 show convergence
for the investigated waveguide sizes and structures. Al-
though these examples do not guarantee the convergence
of our method in all waveguide sizes and geometries, we
expect our method to converge in various types and sizes
of waveguides provided that geometry speciﬁc modiﬁca-
tions to the discretization scheme are implemented.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated an open geometry Fourier
modal method formalism relying on open boundary con-
ditions and non-uniform k-space sampling. Due to the
inherent open boundary conditions we avoid the artiﬁ-
cial absorbing boundary conditions, that in some cases
lead to numerical artifacts. We have tested the approach
by investigating the dipole emission in a bulk, close to
an interface, and in waveguide structures and by calcu-
lating the reﬂection coeﬃcient of the fundamental waveg-
uide mode for a nanowire-metal interface. Our simula-
tions show that the calculations based on the open ge-
ometry Fourier modal method formalism indeed converge
towards an open geometry limit when varying the cut-oﬀ
and the number of modes and that the use of the non-
uniform discretization scheme leads to a faster conver-
gence of the simulations compared to using the conven-

Appendix A: Fourier-Bessel expansion in cylindrical

coordinates

The derivation of open BC method in rotationally
symmetric case is outlined following the approach pre-
sented in [18]. We use cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z).
Since the considered structures are rotationally symmet-
ric, the angular dependence is expanded using Fourier
n=−∞ En(r, z) exp(inφ). The con-
tributions En(r, z) for diﬀerent orders n are decoupled,
and it is thus possible to solve for each order individu-
ally. This advantage is exploited to reduce the 2D lateral
eigenvalue problem to an eﬀective 1D problem.

tional equidistant discretization. We expect that our new
method will prove useful in accurate modeling of a variety
of nanophotonic structures, for which the open bound-
aries are inherently diﬃcult to describe. Also, exten-
sion of the formalism to three-dimensional Fourier modal
method is straightforward, and could be used for accu-
rate modeling of, for example, light emission in photonic
crystal membrane waveguides [2, 3].
