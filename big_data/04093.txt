Abstract: Jackknife empirical likelihood (JEL) is an eﬀective modiﬁed version of em-
pirical likelihood method (EL). Through the construction of the jackknife pseudo-
values, JEL overcomes the computational diﬃculty of EL method when its con-
straints are nonlinear while maintaining the same asymptotic results for one sample
and two-sample U statistics. In this paper, we propose an adjusted version of JEL to
guarantee that the adjusted jackknife empirical likelihood (AJEL) statistic is well-
deﬁned for all the values of the parameter, instead of restricting on the convex hull
of the estimation equation. The properties of JEL have been preserved for AJEL.

Keywords: Jackknife empirical likelihood; Adjusted empirical likelihood; Coverage
probability; Conﬁdence interval; Wilks’ theorem.

Introduction

Empirical likelihood has been extensively studied and applied to diﬀerent ﬁelds
since it was ﬁrst introduced by Owen (1988,1990). It combines the advantage of
the ﬂexibility from nonparametric part and the eﬃciency from parametric part with
the establishment of Wilks’ theorem. See Owen (2001) for details. To obtain the
statistic based on the empirical likelihood, it involves the maximization of the non-
parametric likelihood through the calculation of Lagrange multiplier subject to given
constraints. However, when the constraints are either linear or can be switched to
be linear, the maximization process of EL method is easy to be accomplished. When
the constraints are nonlinear, it will face some computational challenges as Jing et
al. (2009) pointed out. They used U-statistics as examples to illustrate the com-
putational diﬃculty of EL method. To overcome this diﬃculty, Jing et al. (2009)

proposed a method called jackknife empirical likelihood method (JEL). The key idea
of JEL is to transfer the statistic of interest to a sample mean situation under the
traditional EL through constructing jackknife pseudo-values, that is, transfer nonlin-
ear constraints to linear constraints and then apply the traditional EL method. The
most attractive property of JEL is its simplicity. Jing et al. also established Wilks’
results of JEL statistic for one sample and two-sample U-statistics. Since then, the
JEL method has been applied to revisit various statistical problems including the
ones which have been studied by the EL method by constructing U-statistics for the
parameter of interest. For example, Gong et al. (2010) and Yang and Zhao (2013)
proposed the methods based on JEL to study the ROC curve with the construction
of the conﬁdence intervals. Yang et al. (2015) developed a procedure based on the
JEL to make statistical inference of the regression parameters for censored data.
Chen et al. (2015) established a testing procedure based on JEL for the equality of
two mean residual life functions. Wang and Zhao (2016) considered the comparison
of two Gini indices for independent data and paired data and established Wilks’
theorem for both situations.

However, as Chen et al. (2008) pointed out, computing proﬁle empirical likeli-
hood function which involves constrained maximization requires that the convex hull
of the estimating equation must have the zero vector as an interior point. When
the required computational problem has no solution, Owen (2001) suggested as-
signing −∞ to the log-EL statistic. Chen et al. (2008) mentioned there are two
drawbacks by doing so. To remedy the drawback of EL method, Chen et al. (2008)
proposed an adjusted empirical likelihood which adds an artiﬁcial term to guarantee
the zero vector to be within the convex hull, therefore, the solution always exists. In
their work, they have showed the asymptotic results of the AEL is the same as that
of the EL. Meanwhile, this method can achieve the improved coverage probabilities
without taking Bartlett-correction or bootstrap calibration.

In this paper, we adapt Chen’s idea and propose an adjusted jackknife empirical
likelihood (AJEL) which combines the advantage of AEL and JEL. We also establish
the Wilks’ theorem for one sample and two-sample U-statistics of AJEL. Since the
proposed method works for one-sample and two-samples U-statistics in general,
therefore, it can be applied for any procedure based on the JEL through U-statistics.
The paper is organized as follows. The main results of AJEL will be introduced in
section 2 with the proofs provided in Appendix. Simulations have been conducted
in section 3 to compare the performance of AJEL and JEL under diﬀerent scenarios.
The results indicate that AJEL improves the coverage probabilities, especially for
small sample sizes. We apply AJEL to two data sets to construct conﬁdence intervals
for parameters and compare them with the ones obtained from JEL. Some discussion
and our future work are provided in section 5.

Let Z1, Z2, . . . , Zn be a random sample from a d.f. F. A U -statistic of degree m
with a symmetric kernel h is deﬁned by

Un =(cid:18) n

m (cid:19)−1 X1≤ii<···<im≤n

h(Zi1, Zi2, . . . , Zin)

and θ = Eh(Zi1, Zi2, . . . , Zin) is the parameter of interest. The jackknife pesudo-

values of Un are given by

bVi = nUn − (n − 1)U (−i)

n−1

where U (−i)
Un = 1
n

n−1 := Un−1(Z1, . . . , Zi−1, Zk+1, . . . , Zn). One can check that EbVi = θ and
nPi=1bVi. Shi (1984) showed that bVi’s are asymptotically independent under
ability pk to bVk. Based on Jing et al. (2009), the jackknife empirical likelihood,

3 Simulation Study

In this section, we conduct a simulation study to illustrate the performance of the
proposed method. Monte Carlo simulations with 1000 repetitions are performed
to calculate coverage rate and average length of conﬁdence intervals. To make fair
comparisons with the JEL developed by Jing et al.
(2009), we choose the same
(2009) used under various scenarios. We use an =
distributions as Jing et al.

log(n)/2 in the deﬁnition of bVn+1.

Example 1. (Probability Weighted Moment) Let X1, X2, . . . , Xn be a random sam-
ple from χ2
1 distribution and we denote F to be this distribution function. Then the
probability weighted moment is θ = E[X1F (X1)] = 0.8183 and the sample probability
weighted moment is a U-statistic with the kernel function h(x, y) = max{x, y} /2.

Table 1 shows the coverage probabilities and average lengths of conﬁdence inter-
vals based on AJEL and JEL approaches for the Example 1. As we can see in the
table when the sample size is relatively small, n = 20 or n = 30, AJEL improves
the coverage probabilities by around 2.5% comparing to those of JEL with slightly
larger of average lengths of conﬁdence intervals. When the sample size is moderate
large, n = 50, the performances of AJEL and JEL are similar. Overall, the AJEL
surpasses the JEL in the coverage probability with the slightly longer average length.

Example 2. (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) Let X1, X2, . . . , Xn1 be inde-
pendently and identically distributed to Exp(1) and Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn2 be independently
and identically distributed to Exp(1/9), respectively. Then the area under the re-
ceiver operating characteristic curve for diagnostic tests or biomarkers with contin-
uous outcome is θ = P (Y1 > X1) = 0.9 and a consistent estimator of θ based on the
U-statistic is given by

Un =

1

n1n2

n1Xi=1

n2Xj=1

I {Yj > Xi} .

The results in Table 2 show that the coverage probability of AJEL is about 1%
higher than that of JEL when the sample size is (n1, n2) = (10, 10) or (20, 20) and two
approaches are comparable in terms of coverage probability when (n1, n2) = (35, 30).
In conclusion, the AJEL outperforms the JEL in terms of the coverage probability
with slightly longer average length.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a genetically transmitted disease which
causes muscle degeneration and weakness. It usually aﬀects boys only since it comes
from the loss of a piece of DMD gene on the X-chromosome. Since a female carrier

of DMD has no apparent symptoms in general, the suspicion of DMD may come
from an aﬀected boy in the family. It is well-known that carriers of DMD tend to
have high levels of some serum enzymes or proteins, such as creatine kinase (CK),
hemopexin (H), lactate dehydroginase (LD) and pyruvate kinase (PK). Andrews
and Herzberg (1985) reported the data which recorded the levels of CK, H, LD, and
PK for 75 blood samples of carriers and 134 samples from noncarriers for studying
the detection of Muscular Dystrophy carriers.

In this section, we apply the adjusted jackknife empirical likelihood approach to
the data set reported from Table 38.1 of Andrews and Herzberg (1985) which is the
same data set in Jing et al. (2009).

4.1 Creatine Kinase Level

Let X be the CK levals in noncarriers of DMD and Y be the CK levels in carriers
of DMD. Then the parameter of interest is θ = P (X < Y ) and the point estimate
of θ is

134 × 75

134Xi=1

75Xj=1

bθ =

I(Xi < Yj) = 0.8635821.

Based on the AJEL approach, the 90% and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for
θ are (0.8101, 0.9071) and (0.7984, 0.9145). While applying the JEL method, the
corresponding 90% and 95% CIs are (0.8108, 0.9065) and (0.7992, 0.9139).

4.2 Comparison of Creatine Kinase and Hemopexin levels

One may be interested in knowing if the measurement of CK levels is more eﬃcient
than that of other levels or which measurement is more eﬃcient than others. For
simplicity and convenience, we compare the CK and H levels which is also the
case Jing et al. (2009) studied. Now, let X 1 and X 2 be the CK and H levels in

6

noncarriers of DMD, respectively, and Y 1 and Y 2 be the CK and H levels in carriers
of DMD, respectively. Then P (X 1 < Y 1) and P (X 2 < Y 2) could help to study the
diagnostic accuracy of CK and H levels, respectively. The parameter of interest is
θ ≡ P (X 1 < Y 1) − P (X 2 < Y 2) and the corresponding point estimator is

bθ =

i − Y 1

j ) − I(X 2

i − Y 2

j )(cid:1) = 0.1942289.

The 90% and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for θ1 − θ2 are (0.1065, 0.2813) and
(0.0890, 0.2983) based on the AJEL approach. While applying the JEL method,
the corresponding 90% and 95% CIs are (0.1076, 0.2801) and (0.0904, 0.2969). Both
results support that the measurement of CK levels is more eﬃcient than that of H
levels.

5 Discussion

The jackknife empirical likelihood (JEL) method proposed by Jing et al. (2009)
overcomes the potential computational diﬃculty in empirical likelihood (EL) when
the constraints are nonlinear, while preserving Wilks’ theorem. The adjusted em-
pirical likelihood (AEL) method proposed by Chen et al.
(2008) guarantees the
existence of the solution of the required maximization of likelihood function with
the establishment of Wilk’s theorem. In this paper, we combine the advantage of
these two methods to develop the adjusted jackknife empirical likelihood (AJEL).
We establish Wilks’ theorem for the proposed AJEL method for one sample and
two-sample U-statistics. Simulations indicates that our method improves the cov-
erage probability comparing to JEL method, especially when the sample sizes are
small. Such a method is applied to two real data to construct the conﬁdence inter-
vals for the parameters. Since the Wilks’ theorem has been derived for the AJEL
on one-sample and two-samples U-statistics, therefore, the proposed method can be
applied to any other procedures based on the JEL through U-statistics and improve
the accuracy of the coverage probability obtained by these procedures.

We only discuss the AJEL method based on U-statistics and develop correspond-
ing properties. In our future work, we are interested in extending the similar idea
to more general class of statistics than U-statistics and investigate the properties of
AJEL method.

The proof of Wilk’s theorem of the AJEL for one-sample U-statistics is similar to
the proof of the AJEL for two-samples U-statistics. Therefore we only provide the
proof of the former case.
