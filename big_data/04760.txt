Abstract / The R Coronae Australis dark cloud is one of the closest star-forming regions to the Sun. The cloud
is known to be very active in star formation, harboring many Herbig-Haro objects (HHs) and Molecular Hydrogen
emission-line Objects (MHOs). In this work we present results from molecular observations (a 5.5
map of
12CO J=3–2 and HCO+ J=4–3, and a single spectrum of N2H+ J=4–3) obtained with the Atacama Submillimeter
(cid:48)(cid:48)
Telescope Experiment (ASTE) towards the R CrA dark cloud with an angular and spectral resolution of 22
and
0.11 km s−1, respectively. From the 12CO J=3–2 line we found kinematical spectral features strongly suggesting
the presence of outﬂows towards a region populated by several HHs and MHOs. Moreover, most of these objects
lie within an HCO+ maximum, suggesting that its emission arises from an increasement of its abundance due to
the chemistry triggered by the outﬂow activity. Additionally, we are presenting the ﬁrst reported detection of
N2H+ in the J=4–3 line towards the R CrA dark cloud.

Introduction

The R Coronae Australis dark cloud (R CrA dark
cloud), located at about 130 pc (Neuh¨auser & Forbrich,
2008), is one of the closest star-forming regions to the
Sun. The cloud is centered on the Herbig Ae/Be stars
R CrA and T CrA, which are the exciting sources of the
reﬂection nebula NGC 6729. It is known that this dark
cloud is very active in star formation (e.g. Lindberg
& Jørgensen 2012), harboring many Herbig-Haro (HHs)
objects and Molecular Hydrogen emission-line Objects
(MHOs). Due to its proximity, this region is a very in-
teresting target to study the molecular gas related to
the star-forming processes.

Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE).
The observations were carried out in August 2010 and
were performed in on-the-ﬂy mapping mode achieving
an angular sampling of 6(cid:48)(cid:48).
In addition, the N2H+
J=4–3 line was observed as a single point at 19:01:52.7,
−36:57:49 (J2000). The angular and spectral resolution
are 22(cid:48)(cid:48) and 0.11 km s−1, respectively. The data were
reduced with NEWSTAR(cid:63) and the spectra processed us-
ing the XSpec software package(cid:63)(cid:63). Polynomials between
ﬁrst and third order were used for baseline ﬁtting.

A region of 5.5(cid:48) × 5.5(cid:48)
in size centered at 19:01:51,
−36:58:20 (J2000) in the R CrA dark cloud was mapped
in the 12CO J=3–2 and HCO+ J=4–3 lines using the

extended to treat single dish data with a graphical user in-

3. Results
Figure 1 shows the 12CO J=3–2 emission integrated be-
tween −15 and +25 km s−1 towards the R CrA dark
cloud. In addition to the molecular study, we search for
HHs objects and MHOs lying in the region from the cat-
alogues of Reipurth (2000) and Davis et al. (2010). This
kind of objects are strong evidences of active star for-
mation. The crosses in Fig. 1 show the position of HHs
and MHOs, which lie mainly within the molecular gas
emission, strongly suggesting that they are embedded in
the molecular cloud.

Fig. 1: 12CO J=3–2 emission integrated between −15 and
+25 km s−1. The contour levels are 30, 50, 70, and 130
K km s−1. The green and cyan crosses represent the posi-
tions of MHO and HH objects, respectively. The red and
blue squares are the positions from which we extracted the
spectra presented in Fig. 2. The beam is presented in the
bottom-left corner.

Fig. 2: Up: 12CO J=3–2 spectrum with a blue-shifted wing
obtained towards the position represented by a blue square
in Fig. 1. Bottom: 12CO J=3–2 spectrum with a red-shifted
wing obtained towards the position indicated with a red
square in Fig. 1. The dashed box in both spectra remarks
the shifted emission components.

From the 12CO data we look for kinematical spectral
evidences of perturbed gas due to the star-forming pro-
cesses. Analyzing the whole data cube we found that
in a region of about 1(cid:48) centered at the position indi-
cated with a blue square in Fig. 1 the spectra present a
blue-shifted wing, while in a region with the same size
centered at the red square (Fig. 1) the spectra show a
red-shifted wing. Two representative spectra of both
regions are presented in Fig. 2. These spectral features
are strong evidences of molecular outﬂows driven by the
young stellar objects (YSOs) embedded in the cloud. A
dynamically study of the outﬂows will be presented in
a further work. Besides, the spectra present a dip at
about 5 km s−1, which shows that the emission is self-
absorbed, suggesting the presence of high-density gas.
Figure 3 (up) displays the HCO+ J=4–3 emission
integrated between +2 and +10 km s−1, the range in
which this line presents emission, towards the R CrA

dark cloud. For comparison, Fig. 3 (bottom) presents
the integrated 12CO emission and the stellar sources

coincides with the 12CO maximum. Most of the HHs
and MHOs lie in the region delimited by the HCO+
emission, suggesting that it arises due to the outﬂowing
phenomenon. It is known that such molecular species
enhances in molecular outﬂows (Rawlings et al., 2004).
Indeed an enhancement of the HCO+ abundance is ex-
pected to occur due to the liberation and photoprocess-
ing by shocks of the molecular material stored in the icy
mantles of the dust.

Figure 4 shows the spectrum of the N2H+ J=4–3
line obtained towards the position indicated with a yel-
low cross in Fig. 3.
It is important to note that this
is the ﬁrst reported detection of N2H+ in the J=4–3
line towards CrA dark cloud.
Its detection, centered
at v ∼ 6.12 km s−1, indicates the presence of high-

was performed for high-mass star forming regions and R
CrA dark cloud hosts low and intermediate mass YSOs,
we can suggest a similar chemistry for both types of
YSOs. In this way, the YSOs related to the molecular
gas analyzed here may be in the later stages of evolution
(Hoq et al., 2013).

density gas and it is an interesting line to study the
ionization and chemistry related to the star-forming pro-
cesses. For instance, it is believed that as star formation
progresses, the temperature rises and thus the CO is re-
leased from the dust, which then interacts with N2H+
through N2H+ + CO → HCO+ + N2 (Busquet et al.,
2011).
Finally, we obtained a line integrated intensity ratio
of I(N2H +)/I(HCO+) ∼ 0.33 at the position in which
the N2H+ was observed. This value is close to the lower
cutoﬀ value assigned to the sources named as “N2H+
