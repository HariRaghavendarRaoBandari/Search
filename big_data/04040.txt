(Dated: March 15, 2016)

The search for unconventional superconductivity has been focused on materials with strong spin-
orbit coupling and unique crystal lattices. Doped bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) is a strong candidate
given the topological insulator nature of the parent compound and its triangular lattice. The
coupling between the physical properties in the superconducting state and its underlying crystal
symmetry is a crucial test for unconventional superconductivity. In this paper, we report direct evi-
dence that the superconducting magnetic response couples strongly to the underlying 3-fold crystal
symmetry in the recently discovered superconductor with trigonal crystal structure, niobium (Nb)-
doped bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3). More importantly, we observed that the magnetic response is
greatly enhanced along one preferred direction spontaneously breaking the rotational symmetry. In-
stead of a simple 3-fold crystalline symmetry, the superconducting hysteresis loop shows dominating
2-fold and 4-fold symmetry. This observation conﬁrms the breaking of the rotational symmetry and
indicates the presence of nematic order in the superconducting ground state of Nb-doped Bi2Se3.
Further, heat capacity measurements display an exponential decay in superconducting state and
suggest that there is no line node in the superconducting gap. These observations provide strong
evidence of odd-parity topological superconductivity.

Unconventional superconductors are characterized by
superconducting order parameters that are non-invariant
under crystal symmetry operations. When the order pa-
rameter is single-component, this non-invariance is man-
ifested solely in the phase of the superconducting wave-
function, and can only be detected by phase-sensitive
measurements. On the other hand, when the order pa-
rameter is multi-component, the magnitude of the super-
conducting gap can be diﬀerent along symmetry-related
crystallographic directions. The gap anisotropy directly
leads to thermodynamic property of the superconduct-
ing state that spontaneously breaks the crystal rotational
symmetry of the normal state. However, direct thermo-
dynamic signature of rotational symmetry breaking due
to superconductivity has not been found in any crystals.

Bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) makes the best material
system to explore for unconventional superconductiv-
ity. The strong spin-orbit coupling in the triangular lat-
tice has led to the topological insulating ground state
in Bi2Se3 [1, 2]. Doping with metallic element such as
copper (Cu) and strontium (Sr) made it superconduct-
ing [3–11]. We report here the ﬁrst direct observation
of rotational symmetry breaking in the superconduct-
ing property of Nb-doped Bi2Se3 [12], a new member
of superconducting doped topological insulators in addi-
tion to Cu- and Sr-doped Bi2Se3. Possible odd-parity
pairing symmetries in doped Bi2Se3, favored by strong
spin-orbit interactions, have been theoretically proposed
and classiﬁed according to the representations of the D3d
point group [5]. Among them, only the odd-parity pair-
ing in the two-dimensional Eu representation gives rise to
a nematic superconductor with broken rotational symme-
try [13]. A recent nuclear magnetic resonance experiment

on CuxBi2Se3 reveals a twofold in-plane anisotropy in the
spin susceptibility of the superconducting state [14], pro-
viding spectroscopic evidence for the Eu pairing. The
pairing symmetries of Nb- and Sr-doped Bi2Se3 remain
unknown.

We applied torque magnetometry to map the complete
angular dependence of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy
in Nb-doped Bi2Se3. The in-plane magnetization dis-
plays the ﬁeld dependent hysteresis characteristic of a
type-II superconductor. The observed hysteresis shows
a large twofold anisotropy, which reveals the broken ro-
tational symmetry in NbxBi2Se3. Our work establishes
torque magnetometry as a new and powerful method for
discovering nematic superconductivity [15, 16].

We used torque magnetometry to measure the su-
perconducting hysteresis loop and magnetization of Nb-
doped Bi2Se3. Magnetic torque is given by (cid:126)τ =µ0V (cid:126)M× (cid:126)H.
Here V is the volume of the sample, (cid:126)H is the external
magnetic ﬁeld, and (cid:126)M is the magnetization of the sam-
ple, given by the derivative of the free energy with respect
to the external ﬁeld H. Torque magnetometry is thus a
thermodynamic probe that measures the free energy in
a sample. The torque is measured by mounting the sam-
ple standing on its edge in order to keep the external
ﬁeld in the ab-plane (see Fig. 1(A)). We then rotated
the cantilever. This measures the in-plane anisotropy of
the sample’s magnetic properties in the superconducting
state. Fig. 1(B) shows the crystal structure of Nb-doped
Bi2Se3 looking down the hexagonal axis. As shown in
the ﬁgure, the external ﬁeld is in the hexagonal plane.
The azimuthal angle, φ, is the angle between the ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld and the x-axis deﬁned along the
cantilever arm. Based on the X-ray diﬀraction pattern of

this particular sample, we ﬁnd that φ = 0◦, 60◦, and 120◦
corresponds to the in-plane mirror axis of the crystal, as
shown in Fig. 1(B).

The samples of Nb-doped Bi2Se3 used in our exper-
iment have superconducting volume close to 100%, as
shown by the volume magnetic susceptibility which ap-
proaches -1 in the zero-ﬁeld cooled run (see Fig. 1(C)).
This is much higher than that of Cu-doped Bi2Se3 [8, 9].
The measured torque shows a strong superconducting
signal. Figure 1(D) shows some examples of the mag-
netic torque from the sample. The torque τ is plotted as
a function of external magnetic ﬁeld at temperate T =
0.3 K. We swept the ﬁeld up and down from -1 T to 1
T to measure the entire superconducting hysteresis loop.
Arrows along the curve show the ﬁeld sweep direction.
The τ − H loop is a signature of the strong ﬂux pinning
characteristic of type-II superconductors. The pinned
ﬂux lines form a vortex solid, and the ﬂux density in-
side the superconductor always resists the change of the
applied magnetic ﬁeld. A simple analysis based on the
Bean model shows that the hysteresis of the magnetiza-
tion gives a direct measurement of the superconducting
critical current density in the mixed state of type-II su-
perconductors (see supplemental materials).

We note that the superconducting hysteresis loops at
the selected angles have a clear angular dependence in φ.
The magnitude of the hysteresis loop reaches a maximum
at around 60◦ and is nearly zero at 30◦ and 90◦. The
variation of the hysteresis loop size is the ﬁrst indication
of anomalous in-plane symmetry in Nb-doped Bi2Se3.

To further illustrate the angular dependence of the su-
perconducting hysteresis loop, we mapped the magnitude
of the hysteresis loop as a function of φ. To ﬁnd the
magnitude of the hysteresis loop, we took the diﬀerence
of the sample’s magnetic torque from the H-increasing
sweep (τ+) and H-decreasing sweep (τ−). We denote
this magnitude as ∆τ = τ+ − τ−. Figure 2(A) shows the
absolute value of the hysteresis magnitude in a polar plot
where ∆τ is plotted against the azimuthal angle, φ. ∆τ
was taken at diﬀerent values of H. The sample was mea-
sured at T = 0.3 K over an angular range of 200◦. We
note that reversing the sign of the magnetic ﬁeld is equiv-
alent to rotating the cantilever 180◦. We thus used the
negative ﬁeld sweep data to complete the 360◦ angular
dependence. The six-fold symmetry is clearly demon-
strated by the observation that ∆τ goes to zero every
60◦. This conﬁrms the H-symmetric nature of the mag-
netic torque from the sample. Figure 2(B) is the polar
plot of spontaneous magnetization, ∆Mef f = M+ − M−,
where M± = τ±/µ0H.

The most important observation is the angular sym-
metry of the hysteresis loop near zero ﬁeld. Figure 3
displays the angular dependence of the eﬀective magne-
tization hysteresis, ∆M = M+ − M− = ∆τ
µ0H at µ0H =
0.03 T. The ﬁtting function, ∆M = A2φ sin(2φ + 30◦) +
A4φsin(4φ − 30◦)), shows the symmetry of the hystere-

2

sis loops. The existence of the 2-fold symmetric sin 2φ
contribution, as well as the 4-fold symmetric sin 4φ term,
suggests the rotational symmetry breaking, i.e., nematic
order, in superconducting Nb-doped Bi2Se3.

Finally, our heat capacity measurement on Nb-doped
Bi2Se3 shows a fully gapped bulk superconductivity (Fig.
4(A)). For the same sample, we measured the heat capac-
ity C at selected T between 0.4 K and 20 K. Fig. 4(A)
shows C
T in the superconducting state at µ0H = 0 T as
well as at 0.75 T, right above the closing of the hysteresis
loop at base T . We note that above 4 K, the heat capacity
C at 0 T is the same as that at 0.75 T, within measure-
ment errors. Therefore, we use the 0.75 T heat capacity
curve as the normal state heat capacity Cn. From this we
determined the phonon contribution following the same
practice as the early work on Cu-doped Bi2Se3 [8]:

Cn = C n

el + Cph = γnT + aT 3 + bT 5

(1)

where the electronic heat capacity C n
el = γnT is for the
normal state. Subtracting the phonon heat capacity, Cph,
we infer the superconducting state electronic heat capac-
ity Cel at 0 T, which is plotted as Cel
T vs. T in Fig. 4(B).
The heat capacity at 0 T shows an exponential decay as
T drops to base temperature. This is a signature of a
fully gapped, nodeless superconducting state.

We note that Cel

T trace approaches a ﬁnite value γres
near the base temperature. This suggests a partial non-
∼
superconducting volume in the crystal of about γres
γn
<20%. This value is consistent with the superconducting
volume we determined from the Meissner eﬀect.
The exponential decay, rather than a typical power-
law dependence, observed in Cel − T is indicative of a
nodeless superconducting gap. Other heat capacity pa-
pers on unconventional superconductors fairly recognize
that a high order power-law can be hard to distinguish
from an exponential decay at low temperatures [10]. For
line nodes, Cel
T should fall linearly with T , and for point
nodes, Cel
should go as T 2
[17]. Line nodes, as have
T
been seen in other unconventional superconductors [18–
20], are clearly ruled out by our data. The absence of line
nodes is consistent with odd-parity superconductivity in
doped Bi2Se3 [13, 21].

Discussion Our study of the magnetic torque demon-
strates a symmetric 6-fold vanishing of the superconduct-
ing hysteresis. Magnetic torque is sensitive to the mag-
netic anisotropy of the superconducting signal, and the
hysteretic M − H loops arise from the ﬂux pinning of the
vortex solids in the superconducting state. Therefore, the
superconducting diamagnetic signal, which comes from
the vortex solid, prefers to align with the 3 mirror planes
of the triangular lattice. The diamagnetic signal is maxi-
mum when the magnetic ﬁeld aligns with these preferred
directions. The magnetic torque (cid:126)τ = µ0 (cid:126)M × (cid:126)H vanishes
between these preferred directions when the M vector is
exactly collinear (parallel or antiparallel) of the applied
ﬁeld H.

The hysteresis loop is greatly enhanced along one di-
rection. This suggests that the nematic order is a sponta-
neous symmetry breaking in the superconducting state.
As pointed in ref.
[13], the nematic order veriﬁes the
two-component nature of the superconducting order pa-
rameter. Thus an odd-parity superconducting order is
very likely to exist in the ground state, which creates
promise for topological superconductivity in Nb-doped
Bi2Se3.

We note that early torque studies on high Tc cuprates,
untwinned YBa2Cu3O7 [22] and Tl2Ba2CuO6+δ [23], also
show in-plane vanishing of the superconducting hysteresis
along their crystal axes. A similar measurement on NbN
and NbSe2, which are classical superconductors with s-
wave symmetry [23], showed no in-plane vanishing of the
hysteretic torque curves.

We would like to also point out a potential diﬀerence
between our observations in Nb-doped Bi2Se3 and the
similar early experimental observation [14] and theoreti-
cal explanation [13] of nematic order in the spin suscep-
tibility of Cu-doped Bi2Se3. In the Cu-doped material,
quantum oscillations [7, 9] and photoemission [6, 11] re-
veal that there is only one bulk Fermi pocket. In con-
trast, the electronic state in Nb-doped Bi2Se3 shows at
least two distinct Fermi surfaces [24]. Our work calls
for further theoretical and experiential exploration of the
impact of multi-orbitals on the search for unconventional
superconductors.

The unique sensitivity of our in-plane torque magne-
tometry leads to a promising new tool for probing the su-
perconducting pairing symmetry of other unconventional
superconductors.
It can elucidate or conﬁrm potential
p-wave superconducting symmetry in materials such as
Sr2RuO4 [25] and UPt3 [26, 27].
In contrast to those
materials, the exponential decay in the heat capacity in
Nb-doped Bi2Se3 suggests a superconducting gap with-
out line nodes. It would be very interesting to investigate
whether a nodal superconducting gap would enhance or
diminish the nematic order in the superconducting state.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We preformed torque magnetometry measurements
with our home built cantilever setup by glueing the Nb-
doped Bi2Se3 single crystal to the end of a thin beryllium
copper cantilever. We then placed the cantilever in an
external magnetic ﬁeld H. We measured the torque on
the cantilever by tracking the capacitance between the
metallic cantilever and a ﬁxed gold ﬁlm underneath us-
ing an AH2700A capacitance bridge with a 7 kHz drive
frequency. We calibrated the spring constant of the can-
tilever by tracking the angular dependence of capacitance
caused by the sample weight at zero magnetic ﬁeld. The
tilt angle φ is deﬁned as the angle between the direction
of the magnetic ﬁeld and the positive x-axis, which is
marked in Fig. 1(A) as the direction of the cantilever
arm.

The sample heat capacity is measured in a Quan-
tum Design Physical Properties Measurement Systems
(PPMS) using the relaxation method.

The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory pro-
vided the magnet and He3 fridge. During the torque
magnetometry measurement, samples were soaked in
pumped liquid helium 3, and the magnetic ﬁeld was swept
at 0.25 T/min.

We preformed the magnetization measurement with a
Quantum Design Magnetic Properties Measurement Sys-
tem at H = 5 Oe.

Superconducting Hysteresis

An external magnetic ﬁeld kills the superconducting
state in a type I superconductor at the critical ﬁeld, Hc.
However, in a type II superconductor, there is a mixed
state between the lower critical ﬁeld, Hc1, and the up-
per critical ﬁeld, Hc2. For Hc1 < H < Hc2, magnetic
ﬂux penetrates the superconductor creating a lattice of
vortices. Due to defects in the sample, these vortices
are pinned in place. In order for the vortices to move,
the Lorentz force from a current near the vortices would
need to overcome this pinning force. Thus, the pinned
magnetic ﬂux has an irreversible response to a changing
external magnetic ﬁeld. This gives rise to hysteresis in
the magnetic response of the superconductor.

The Bean model [1, 2] successfully explained this hys-
teretic feature in type II superconductors. In this model,
we assume that the current density in the superconductor
can only take the values of 0 and Jc, where Jc is the criti-
cal current density. Due to the Ampere’s law, the spacial
proﬁle of Jc determines b(x), the magnetic ﬂux density
of unit volume at each location x in the superconductor.
Integrating b(x) gives the total magnetic ﬁeld density B
inside the superconductor.

Figure 5 shows the magnetic ﬂux density inside the
superconductor (represented by the grey shaded region)
for (A) ﬁeld increasing from H = 0 to H0 and (B) ﬁeld
decreasing to H0 after an applied external ﬁeld greater
than Hc2. Due to the ﬂux-pinning, the internal mag-
netic ﬂux density b(x)/µ0 cannot respond to the change
in the sweep direction of the external magnetic ﬁeld. Fig.
5(A) represents the magnetic ﬂux density b(x)/µ0 as the
applied magnetic ﬁeld is swept up from zero to H0. In
db(x)
this one dimensional analysis, Jc = 1
µ0
would be simply the slope of b(x)
vs. x. The spacial pro-
µ0
ﬁle of Jc is constant, as shown in the right panel of Fig
5(A).

∇b(r) = 1

The situation of ﬁeld-sweeping-down is diﬀerent. As
the applied ﬁeld is swept from a large ﬁeld to the same
H0, the b(x)/µ0 proﬁle response lags, as show in Fig.
5(B).

The magnetization of the sample is given by the dif-
ference between the average magnetic ﬂux density within
the sample, B, and the applied ﬁeld, H, outside:

where w is the typical width of the domain size in the
superconductor, or the sample size if the whole sample is
in a single domain. In the case of Panel A, Eq. 2 would
be simply the shaded area −wJc which gives M+, the
magnetization at ﬁeld sweeping up.

Furthermore, the diﬀerence between Panel A and B
demonstrates the hysteresis in the magnetization of type
II superconductors. Going through the same analysis as
above, we ﬁnd the magnetization of ﬁeld sweeping down
M− = wJc As a result, the hysteresis loop size ∆M (H) ≡
M+ − M− = 2wJc. Therefore, the measurement of the
hysteresis loop is a direct probe of the critical current
density in a type II superconductor.

superconductors (color online) (A) Magnetic ﬂux density in
a type II superconductor as external magnetic ﬁeld is swept
up from H = 0 to H0 > 0 according to the Bean model. The
right inset shows a sketch of the critical current density proﬁle
at H0 during the upsweep. Magnetization M corresponds to
the dark shaded area. (B) Magnetic ﬂux density in a type II
superconductor as external magnetic ﬁeld is swept down from
H > Hc2 to H0. The lagging of the internal magnetic ﬂux
density due to ﬂux pinning gives rise to hysteresis in magne-
tization. The sample’s critical current density proﬁle for the
down sweep is shown in the right panel. Figure adapted from

Evolution of the nematic order under magnetic ﬁelds

∆M = M+ − M− vs φ for Nb-doped Bi2Se3 is well
ﬁtted by the function f (φ) = A2φsin(2φ + 30◦) +
A4φsin(4φ − 30◦). We performed Fourier analysis on
∆M − φ to determine the strength of the nematic or-
der as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. Figure 6(A) shows
the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of ∆M at 0.05 T. The
ﬁrst peak, A2φ, is the amplitude of the nematic order
sin(2φ). The second peak, A4φ, represents the 4-fold
term. Because increasing the magnetic ﬁeld H greatly
shrinks the magnetization loop ∆M , both A2φ and A4φ
dramatically deceases. However, they decrease in diﬀer-
ent rates. Fig.6(B) shows the ratio of A2φ over A4φ. Both
A2φ and A4φ are leading terms near zero ﬁeld. When H
increases close to the upper critical ﬁeld, A2φ dramat-

the superconductor approaches the normal state conﬁrms
that it is an intrinsic feature of the superconducting state
in Nb-doped Bi2Se3.

We would like to note that for a broad ﬁeld range
that absolute amplitude of A2φ and A4φ are equal. At
this condition, the ﬁtting function turns to be f (φ) =
2A2φsin(φ − 30◦) cos 3φ. This ﬁtting reveals a possible
origin of the observed rotational symmetry breaking. The
eﬀective superconducting magnetic moment follows the
product of sin(φ − 30◦) and cos 3φ, rather than the sum
of two ordering functions. Therefore, there is a strong
coupling between the 3-fold crystalline symmetry and a
nematic ordering in the triangular superconductor Nb-
doped Bi2Se3. The phases between these two sinusoidal
functions are locked in the measurement. This obser-
vation shows that these two symmetric orderings couple
strongly with each other. This suggests that while ne-
matic order is a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the
superconducting state, the order seems to be stabilized
by the 3-fold crystalline symmetry. The coupling makes
sure that the nematic ordering direction is locked to one
of the mirror planes of the triangular lattice. As pointed
in ref. [13], the nematic order veriﬁes the two-component
nature of the superconducting order parameter. Thus an
odd-parity superconducting order is very likely to exist
in the ground state, which creates promise for topological
superconductivity in Nb-doped Bi2Se3.

Symmetry Breaking in diﬀerent cooling down

Fig.7 shows ∆M = M+ − M− vs φ for the same Nb-
doped Bi2Se3 in two diﬀerent cool downs. The data in
panel (A) if from a cool down in a He-3 cryostat, and
panel (B) is from a diﬀerent cool down in a dilution re-
frigerator. In both cases, the preferred axis is locked on
a crystalline mirror plane. However, in the two cases, the
preferred axis is along roughly the same axis. This second
cooling data conﬁrms the observation of the spontaneous
symmetry breaking in Nb-doped Bi2Se3.

Rotational Symmetry Breaking in other Nb-doped

Bi2Se3 samples

We repeated the search for rotational symmetry break-
ing in the hysteretic property of Nb-doped Bi2Se3 with a
second piece of superconducting Nb-doped Bi2Se3. This
sample is designated sample E. Sample E was cooled
down to 20 mK in a dilution refrigerator. We swept the
ﬁeld up and down from -1 T to 1 T to measure the entire
superconducting hysteresis loop. As in the main text,
we applied torque magnetometry to map the complete
angular dependence of its in-plane magnetic anisotropy.

stant background magnetization labeled A0. The eﬀec-
tive magnetization loop ∆M follows A0 + A2φ sin(2φ −
α) + A4φsin(4φ − β). This angular-independent oﬀset
likely arises from the torsional twist of the cantilever
setup, although further experiments are needed to deter-
mine the exact origin. For further analysis, we subtract
away the A0 term to get the angular dependence of the
in-plane eﬀective magnetization.

Fig.8(B) shows a polar plot of the eﬀective magneti-
zation versus angle φ of sample E. The superconduct-
ing hysteresis loop closes at regular intervals correspond-
ing to the axes normal to the mirror planes of the crys-
tal structure. The rotational symmetry is again broken.
This is consistent with the sample from the main text.

χef f = d(τ /H)
dH of Nb-doped Bi2Se3 as a function of angle
φ in H = 1.8 T and 1.9 T external magnetic ﬁeld. The
external ﬁeld in this ﬁgure is much larger than Hc2, thus
the sample is not in the superconducting state. There-
fore we are able to see in the in-plane anisotropy of the
magnetic susceptibility in the normal state. The angular
dependence of χef f follows the characteristic sin 2φ de-
pendence of the paramagnetic normal state. For a para-
magnetic material, the magnetic torque τ = µ0M × H
follows

where ∆χ = χz − χx is the anisotropy of the magnetic
susceptibility of the sample. The observation in Fig. 9
shows that the eﬀective susceptibility follows the sin 2φ
dependence and the maximum and minimum are aligned
with 135 degree and 45 degree, respectively. This obser-
vation is consistent with the normal paramagnetic state.

and not the result of geometric anisotropy in any given
sample.

Fig.8(C) shows a FFT showing the relative strength
of the nematic term, sin(2φ), and the crystal symmetry
term, sin(4φ). The ﬁrst peak, A2φ, is the amplitude of the
nematic order sin(2φ). The second peak, A4φ, represents
the 4-fold symmetric term.

The ratio A2φ
A4φ

is a measure of the strength of the ne-
matic order over the background crystal symmetry. As
seen in Fig.8(D), A2φ is the leading term near zero ﬁeld.
When H increases close to the upper critical ﬁeld, A2φ
dramatically vanishes. The vanishing of the nematic or-
der as the superconductor approaches the normal state
follows the same trend as the main text sample shown in
Fig.6.
