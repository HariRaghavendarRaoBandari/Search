Abstract. We present the results of two 2.3 µm near-infrared (NIR) radial velocity (RV) sur-
veys to detect exoplanets around 36 nearby and young M dwarfs. We use the CSHELL spectro-
graph (R ∼46,000) at the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF), combined with an isotopic
methane absorption gas cell for common optical path relative wavelength calibration. We have
developed a sophisticated RV forward modeling code that accounts for fringing and other in-
strumental artifacts present in the spectra. With a spectral grasp of only 5 nm, we are able to
reach long-term radial velocity dispersions of ∼20-30 m/s on our survey targets.

1. Introduction

We are carrying out an exoplanet search to exploit the “M dwarf opportunity.” Approx-
imately 70% of main sequence stars are M dwarfs, spanning a factor of 5 in mass/radius
and ∼103 in luminosity. Due to their smaller masses and radii and cooler temperatures
compared to FGK stars, transiting exoplanets produced deeper eclipses of M dwarfs,
exoplanet habitable zones are closer, and exoplanet radial velocity amplitude reﬂex mo-
tions are larger. More recently, a new “M dwarf opportunity” for ﬁnding exoplanets has
been identiﬁed with the Kepler mission – not only are planets smaller than 4 R⊕ more
common than Jovian planets, they are predominantly found around lower mass stars
(Howard et al. 2012, Dressing & Charbonneau 2013).
There are several factors spoiling the “M dwarf opportunity.” First, M dwarfs are red
and faint, with V − K > 3.5 mag and only 4 M4 or later dwarfs with V < 12 mag.
Additionally, small planetary RV signals are comparable in amplitude and time-scale to
numerous periodic perturbing stellar jitter signals such as rotational spot modulation &
magnetic activity cycles (Vanderberg et al. 2015, Robertson et al. 2015). One solution
to both of these challenges is to observe in the NIR, where M dwarfs put out much of
their bolometric luminosity, and the amplitude of stellar jitter is diminished (Reiners et
al. 2010, Plavchan et al. 2013a,b,2015, Anglada-Escude et al. 2012).

solid black lines correspond to the RV semi-amplitude of Habitable Zone (HZ) exoplanets with
the indicated masses as a function of stellar mass.

2. Results and Conclusions

We have obtained our goal precision of ∼30-60 m/s in our young M dwarf survey from
2010-2012, and ∼20-30 m/s in 2014 at higher SNR for nearby M dwarfs not previously
surveyed by visible RV teams. We present a sample RV curve and our survey results in
Figure 1. We are in the process of publishing our detailed survey results.
Looking towards the future, we have made the gas cells for iSHELL (R∼75,000, spectral
grasp of 250 nm), which will replace CSHELL in 2016. We expect to get to < 5 m/s
precision with iSHELL due to the increased spectral grasp alone (Figure 2). The increased
eﬃciency, resolution, no fringing, and smaller number of bad pixels will provide further
improvements.
