ABSTRACT
The far-infrared ﬁne-structure line [C ii] at 1900.5 GHz is known to be one of the brightest
cooling lines in local galaxies, and therefore it has been suggested to be an eﬃcient tracer
for star-formation in very high-redshift galaxies. However, recent results for galaxies at z > 6
have yielded numerous non-detections in star-forming galaxies, except for quasars and sub-
millimeter galaxies. We report the results of ALMA observations of two lensed, star-forming
galaxies at z = 6.029 and z = 6.703. The galaxy A383-5.1 (star formation rate [SFR] of
3.2 M(cid:12) yr−1 and magniﬁcation of µ = 11.4) shows a line detection with L[CII] = 8.3 × 106 L(cid:12),
making it the so far lowest L[CII] ever detected at z > 6. For MS0451-H (SFR = 0.4 M(cid:12) yr−1
and µ = 100 ± 20) we provide an upper limit of L[CII] < 3 × 105 L(cid:12), which is 1 dex below
the local SFR-L[CII] relations. The results are consistent with predictions for low-metallicity
galaxies at z > 6, however, other eﬀects could also play a role in terms of decreasing L[CII].
The detection of A383-5.1 is encouraging and suggests that detections are possible, but much
fainter than initially predicted.

INTRODUCTION

During the past decade, the number of galaxies with measured red-
shifts z > 6 has increased signiﬁcantly (e.g. Hu et al. 2002; Iye et al.
2006) with even a few spectroscopic redshifts of z > 7 (Vanzella
et al. 2011; Ono et al. 2012; Schenker et al. 2012; Shibuya et al.
2012; Finkelstein et al. 2013; Watson et al. 2015; Oesch et al. 2015;
Zitrin et al. 2015), demonstrating the tremendous potential for pro-
gress of our understanding of galaxy formation during the ﬁrst bil-
lion years after the Big Bang. There is an even larger number of
galaxies with photometric redshifts z > 6 (e.g. McLure et al. 2013;
Smit et al. 2015), however, spectroscopic redshifts are essential for
studying the physical properties of the interstellar medium and the
gas that fuels the star formation. Because of the intrinsic high lu-
minosity and the large gas masses, several starburst and quasar host
galaxies have been studied in great detail at z > 6 (e.g. Maiolino
et al. 2005; Venemans et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013; Riechers et al.

2013; Willott et al. 2015a; Bañados et al. 2015; Cicone et al. 2015;
Venemans et al. 2015). Such galaxies are interesting to understand
the evolution of the most massive galaxies but are not representat-
ive of the overall galaxy population.

Various tracers are used for determining the properties of the
gas in star-forming galaxies. In terms of studying molecular gas,
CO is most commonly used as it is the second most abundant mo-
lecule and with bright emission lines from the rotational transitions
that are visible in the (sub-)mm bands. One of the brightest lines
seen in the far-infrared (FIR) in local star-forming galaxies is the
ﬁne-structure (FS) line [C ii] (2P3/2 → 2P1/2) at 1900.537 GHz,
which is found to correlate with the star formation rate (e.g. De
Looze et al. 2014; Sargsyan et al. 2014). While local studies of the
FIR FS lines are diﬃcult due to the opacity of the Earth’s atmo-
sphere, at high z the lines are shifted towards the (sub-)mm bands
and thus observable with ground-based telescopes.

With the increased ground-based capabilities of mm-
wavelength telescopes, it has become possible to search for the
[C ii] line in less extreme galaxies at z > 6. However, a clear pic-

ture of this line as a tracer of the star formation is not emerging.
Recently, Capak et al. (2015) and Willott et al. (2015b) detected
[C ii] in bright Lyman-break galaxies (LBG) at 5 < z < 6 and
z ∼ 6.1, respectively, with the [C ii] line luminosities and SFR fol-
lowing similar relations as those found for local star-forming galax-
ies. The galaxies are UV-luminous (1-4L∗), representing the bright
end of the UV-luminosity function. Maiolino et al. (2015) targeted
three LBGs within the redshift range z = 6.8 − 7.1, but did not
detect the [C ii] line despite the galaxies having estimated SFRs
∼ 5 − 15 M(cid:12) yr−1. However, they ﬁnd a detection oﬀ-set from one
of the targets possibly explained by feedback and/or gas accretion.
Similarly, Schaerer et al. (2015) obtained upper limits for two other
LBGs at z ∼ 6.5 − 7.5, of which one is lensed and with sub-L∗ lu-
minosity. Lyα emitting galaxies have been observed, including the
massive Lyα-blob ’Himiko’, however, no conﬁrmed detection has
so far been obtained (e.g. Ouchi et al. 2013; Kanekar et al. 2013;
Ota et al. 2014; González-López et al. 2014). Almost all of these
galaxies have non-detections in the FIR continuum suggesting a
low dust-mass. Watson et al. (2015) found a clear detection of dust
emission from a spectroscopically conﬁrmed z = 7.5 galaxy, how-
ever, did not detect an expected bright [C ii] line in the frequency
range covered. The galaxy is strongly lensed by a magniﬁcation
factor of 9.5, thus providing constraints on a sub-L∗ galaxy.
In this letter we present ALMA observations of [C ii] for two
sub-L∗ galaxies at z > 6. The two sources are A383-5.1 (z = 6.027)
and MS0451-H (z = 6.703), which have estimated SFRs of 3.2
and 0.4 M(cid:12) yr−1, respectively, and estimated magniﬁcation factors
of µ =11.4 and 100 ± 20, respectively (Richard et al. 2011; Stark
et al. 2015, Kneib et al. in preparation). The strong lensing of both
galaxies enables us to probe intrinsically fainter luminosities and
SFR than previous observations. Throughout this letter we assume
a ΛCDM cosmology with H0 = 67.3 km s−1 Mpc−1, ΩM = 0.315,
and ΩΛ = 0.685 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014).

2 OBSERVATIONS
We observed the sources MS0451−H and A383−5.1 with ALMA
in Cycle-2. The observations were carried out in December 2014,
January and May 2015. A separate receiver setup was used for each
source tuning to the redshifted [C ii] line; for A383 at z = 6.027
1 the central frequency was 270.462 GHz and for MS0451-H at
z = 6.703 it was 246.727 GHz. The correlator was used in the
frequency domain mode with one spectral window (spw) having a
bandwidth of 1.875 GHz centered on the aforementioned frequen-
cies, and the three other available spw’s used a continuum setup
with a bandwidth of 2 GHz each distributed over 128 channels.
The telescope conﬁguration has baselines extending between 15
and 350 m for MS0451-H and 15 to 540 m for A383-5.1; the obser-
vations include baselines longer than initially proposed for. Table
1 summarizes the details of the observations including a list of the
calibrators.

Reduction, calibration, and imaging was done using casa
(Common Astronomy Software Application2; McMullin et al.
2007). The pipeline reduced data delivered from the observatory
was of suﬃcient quality, no additional ﬂagging and further calib-
ration was necessary. The pipeline includes the steps required for

standard reduction and calibration, such as ﬂagging, bandpass cal-
ibration, as well as ﬂux and gain calibration. In the case of A383-
5.1, a continuum source, ﬂux density ∼ 2 mJy, is seen 11 arcsec
south of the point center. We attempted to self-calibrate using this
relatively bright source, however, this did not signiﬁcantly improve
the sensitivity.

The data was imaged both as continuum and spectral cube us-
ing natural weighting. A continuum image was produced combin-
ing all spectral windows, while a spectral cube was constructed for
the spectral window tuned to the redshifted [C ii] line. The obtained
resolution is 0.86(cid:48)(cid:48) × 0.67(cid:48)(cid:48) PA = 94◦ for A383-5.1 and 1.6(cid:48)(cid:48) × 0.9(cid:48)(cid:48)
PA = 84◦, and in both cases the 1σ r.m.s. is 11 µJy beam−1. The rms
in a 15.6 MHz channel near the redshifted line is 0.125 mJy beam−1
and 0.163 mJy beam−1 for A383-5.1 and MS0451-H, respectively.

3 RESULTS

In case of A383-5.1 we detect the redshifted [C ii] line. The spec-
trum is shown in Fig. 1 together with an image of the integ-
rated line overlaid on a near-infrared HST F140W image from the
CLASH survey3. We ﬁt a Gaussian line proﬁle to the extracted
spectrum and use this to derive the line properties. The resulting
ﬁt parameters are: central frequency ν = 270.4448 ± 0.0061 GHz,
peak ﬂux of S peak = 0.96 ± 0.19 mJy, and FWHM line width of
∆V = 100 ± 23 km s−1. This corresponds to an integrated line in-
tensity I[CII] = 0.096 ± 0.028 Jy km s−1. We derive a redshift of
z[CII] = 6.0274± 0.0002, which is in agreement with the optical/UV
redshift of 6.029 ± 0.002 (Richard et al. 2011) and the Ciii] red-
shift of 6.0265 ± 0.00013 (Stark et al. 2015). We note the spectrum
has been extracted from a datacube, which was imaged using nat-
ural weighting and tapering with 2D Gaussian with a corresponding
1(cid:48)(cid:48) width as the source appears to be marginally extended. Using
the uv-data of collapsed spectral channels around the peak of the
emission line, we estimate the size of the source to be ∼ 0.16(cid:48)(cid:48) as-
suming a 2D Gaussian brightness distribution, however, due to the
modest signal-to-noise ratio it is diﬃcult to accurately measure its
extent. The continuum is not detected, and we place a 5σ upper
level 55 µJy.

In the ﬁeld around A383-5.1 we also detect two continuum
sources, at 02:48:03.4, -03:31:44.86 with a ﬂux of 2.2 mJy, and at

ated source size of 2.4(cid:48)(cid:48) × 1.1(cid:48)(cid:48) PA = 60 ◦. The former is associated
with the cD galaxy of the cluster (z = 0.188), and the latter is asso-
ciated with a spiral galaxy at z = 0.65 (denoted B18 in Smith et al.
2001).

For MS0451-H, we do not detect a line, and in Fig. 2 we show
the extracted spectrum from the region corresponding to the near-
infrared (NIR) source; as for A383-5.1, the spectrum was extracted
from a cube that was imaged using natural weighting and taper-
ing. We measure a 1σ rms of 0.05 mJy beam−1 for a channel of
100 km s−1. Assuming this corresponds to the FWHM width of the
line, we estimate a 5σ upper limit of 0.026 Jy km s−1. We do not
detect the continuum and place an upper limit of 55 µJy.
We estimate the [C ii] line luminosity using L[CII] = 1.04 ×
10−3S ∆VD2
Lνobs (e.g. Solomon & Vanden Bout 2005; Carilli &
Walter 2013). De Looze et al. (2014) has investigated the [C ii]
line as a SFR estimator for local star-forming galaxies against other
probes and for diﬀerent classes of galaxies. We use the relation for
low-metallicity galaxies to estimate the SFR from L[CII] under the
assumption that the [C ii] line traces star formation in the galaxies.
Furthermore, we use the continuum upper limit to estimate the FIR
luminosity upper limits assuming a modiﬁed blackbody spectrum
with a temperature T = 35 K and β = 1.6. For comparison with
the SFR derived from the optical/NIR observations, we estimate an
SFR from the LFIR assuming a Chabrier IMF (e.g. Carilli & Walter
2013). We correct the values for the estimated gravitational magni-
ﬁcation (Richard et al. 2011, Kneib et al., in preparation). Results
and upper limits are summarised in Table 2. We note that the CMB
temperature is 19.1 K and 21 K for z = 6.027 and z = 6.703, re-
spectively. Following the analysis of da Cunha et al. (2013), we
estimate that the CMB heating would increase the temperature by
less than a per cent for the assumed values and that about 14-20%
of the intrinsic ﬂux density would be missed due to the CMB back-
ground emission.

4 DISCUSSION

A383-5.1 has the lowest [C ii] luminosity among all detections of
this line at z > 6, and the upper limit for MS0451−H is more than
1.5 dex below other upper limits. Both galaxies are selected as UV-
bright, star-forming, and with gravitational magniﬁcation > 10.
The latter enabled us to do deeper observations than previously
presented and thus probe towards SFRs and stellar masses com-
parable to the low-mass end and less extreme systems. In Fig. 3
we show the results together with results for other high-z and local
galaxies.

Using combined stellar population synthesis modeling and
photoionization modeling of the gas-component, Stark et al. (2015)
ﬁnds that the metallicity is log(Z/Z(cid:12)) = −1.33 for A383-5.1. This
relatively low metallicity is comparable to the metallicity found in
some nearby dwarf galaxies. The the line luminosity for A383-5.1,
as well as the MS0451-H upper limit and the FIR luminosity limits
are similar to nearby, low-Z dwarfs’. Using Herschel PACS spec-
troscopy, Cormier et al. (2015) studied the properties of FIR ﬁne-
structure lines, including the [C ii] line, of the low-Z ISM of dwarf
galaxies. The L[CII]/LIR ratio has a large scatter for dwarf galaxies,
and the lowest metallicity systems, Z/Z(cid:12) < 1/20, agree with that
scatter. Based on the L[CII] of A383-5.1, assuming a ratio of 0.6%
and 0.06%, we estimate LIR ∼ 1.4 − 14 × 109 L(cid:12). This is partly in
agreement with the lower limit on the L[CII]−LFIR ratio derived from
our results (see Table 2), suggesting that the [C ii] line contributes

line luminosity is correlated with the star-formation rate of galaxies
(e.g. De Looze et al. 2014; Sargsyan et al. 2014), however, for IR
bright starburst galaxies and AGN, the eﬃciency drops (e.g. Díaz-
Santos et al. 2013).

It is unclear why so many z > 6 galaxies remain undetected,
or as in the case of A383-5.1, show a fainter than predicted [C ii]
line. It has been suggested that low metallicity is the main reason.
As shown in PDR-modelling, the [C ii] line intensity decreases for
lower metallicity, although not linearly (e.g. Röllig et al. 2006).
Given that the [C ii] line correlates well with the SFR for nearby,
low-metallicity galaxies (e.g. De Looze et al. 2014), it would be
expected that this is also the case for high-z low-metallicity galax-
ies. However, the [C ii] deﬁcit suggests that the physical conditions
are very diﬀerent from nearby low-Z galaxies. This [C ii] deﬁcit
is diﬀerent from the classical one found for FIR luminous galaxies
(e.g. Luhman et al. 2003; Stacey et al. 2010). Aside from metallicity
playing a role, other mechanisms could contribute, such as a harder
radiation ﬁeld which could further ionize the carbon into C++; in
fact the spectral modeling of A383-5.2 (the counterimage) yields a
high ionization parameter logU = 1.79 (Stark et al. 2015). In such
case, observations of e.g. Ciii] lines would reveal elevated ratios.
Increased temperature of the ISM and PDRs would result in other
ﬁne-structure lines being more eﬃciant coolants and thus brighter
than [C ii]. For example, the [Oiii] 88 µm line is normally expected
to be tracing Hii regions rather than diﬀuse and clumpy inter-cloud
medium (see e.g. Cormier et al. 2015, for further details).

In simulations of high-z galaxies, the recent study by Vallini
et al. (2015) focused on diﬀerences arising when taking into ac-
count varying metallicity. Vallini et al. (2015) produces a metalli-
city dependent relation for L[CII]-SFR based on a constant metalli-
city distribution throughout the simulated galaxy (z = 6.6). For low
Z, Z = 0.05 − 0.2 Z(cid:12), the relation is below that of local galaxies.
A383-5.1 has a metallicity similar to the low-Z assumption of the
Vallini et al. (2015) model. The model results are consistent with
our detection of A383-5.1, which suggests that metallicity plays an
important role. However, given that we only have one detection and
the remaining being non-detections, we cannot conﬁrm this. We
show the Vallini et al. model results in Fig. 3, and for comparison,
include the resulting relation from multi-phase ISM simulations of
z ∼ 2 massive galaxies by Olsen et al. (2015), which tends to follow
the relations seen for local galaxies.

It is, however, important to also investigate the selection bias
for high-z galaxies. The fact that Lyman-α emitters, despite high
estimates for SFR, remain undetected in the relatively deep ALMA
observations of the [C ii] line, could suggest that SFRs are over-
estimated and while the Ly-α emission likely traces star formation,
a fraction of it could be powered by other mechanisms, such as
shocks of gas inﬂow.

To summarize, while it has been suggested that [C ii] would
be a relatively bright tracer for star formation in high-z galaxies
– and with the advantage of being redshifted into the ∼ 1 mm
wavelength range – the recent results show that the line luminos-

signiﬁcantly to the cooling. For MS0451-H, we do not have an es-
timate for the metallicity given the limited optical (rest-frame UV)
data available (Kneib et al., in preparation).
The sample from Capak et al. (2015) contains bright LBGs
with luminosities > L∗ and in the redshift range 5 < z < 6, and
while this is below the redshift range that we are probing (z > 6),
it is to date the largest sample of [C ii] detections of galaxies that
are not quasar host galaxies nor SMGs. That sample is in reason-
able agreement with the SFR−L[CII] relations seen for local galaxies
(e.g. De Looze et al. 2014). Similarly, the two LBG detections from
Willott et al. (2015b) also follow these relations. On the other hand,
several [C ii] searches towards both LAEs and LBGs have resul-
ted in non-detections (Ota et al. 2014; González-López et al. 2014;
Maiolino et al. 2015; Schaerer et al. 2015), where several observa-
tions provide upper limits below the local SFR−L[CII] comparable
to our detection of A383-5.1.

With an excitation temperature of 91.2 K and the ionization
potential of carbon of 11.2 eV, the [C ii] is a good tracer of the dif-
fuse ISM, of the cold neutral medium (CNM) phase as well as of
the photon-dominated regions (PDRs) caused by star-formation in

This paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX ﬁle prepared by the author.

ity does not follow the same correlations as local galaxies. With
the A383-5.1 detection, we ﬁnd that it is possible to detect [C ii]
towards z > 6 star-forming galaxies, although the line luminosity
is lower than predicted from local galaxies and also from high-z
SMGs and QSO hosts. This implies that future observations have
the potential to yield detections, although the predicted line ﬂux
will likely be lower than when derived from local relations, even
when using local low-Z relations.
