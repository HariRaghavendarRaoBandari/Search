We present a high statistics study of the pion and nucleon light and strange quark sigma terms
using Nf = 2 dynamical non-perturbatively improved clover fermions with a range of pion masses
down to mπ ∼ 150 MeV and several volumes, Lmπ = 3.4 up to 6.7, and lattice spacings, a =
0.06 − 0.08 fm, enabling a study of ﬁnite volume and discretisation eﬀects for mπ (cid:38) 260 MeV.
Systematics are found to be reasonably under control. For the nucleon we obtain σπN = 35(6) MeV
and σs = 35(12) MeV, or equivalently in terms of the quark fractions, fTu = 0.021(4), fTd = 0.016(4)
and fTs = 0.037(13), where the errors include estimates of both the systematic and statistical
uncertainties. These values, together with perturbative matching in the heavy quark limit, lead to
fTc = 0.075(4), fTb = 0.072(2) and fTt = 0.070(1). In addition, through the use of the (inverse)
Feynman-Hellmann theorem our results for σπN are shown to be consistent with the nucleon masses
determined in the analysis. For the pion we implement a method which greatly reduces excited state
contamination to the scalar matrix elements from states travelling across the temporal boundary.
This enables us to demonstrate the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner expectation σπ = mπ/2 over our range
of pion masses.

INTRODUCTION

2

How the quark and gluon constituents of matter account for the properties of hadronic bound states is of fundamental
interest. The decomposition for one of the most basic properties, the hadron mass, has been understood for some
time [1–3], however, the magnitude of each contribution is as yet only approximately known due to its non-perturbative
nature. Of particular importance are quark scalar matrix elements that form the quark contribution to the hadron
mass. For the case of the nucleon, these matrix elements are also needed for determining the size of dark matter-nucleon
scattering cross-sections for direct detection experiments (see, for example, Refs. [4–9]). A variety of approaches have
been used to determine the scalar matrix elements or sigma terms, for example, by analysing pion-nucleon scattering
data within chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) [10–12] or with a dispersive treatment [13, 14]. Lattice calculations,
as a ﬁrst principles approach, are now gaining prominence, not least due to the reﬁnement of techniques and increase
in computational power available which now allows for the direct evaluation of the sigma terms at the physical
point [15, 16]. In this work, we present results for the pion and nucleon scalar matrix elements close to the physical
point, but also investigate the quark mass dependence up to mπ (cid:46) 500 MeV and the lattice systematics including
lattice spacing and volume dependence. On a technical note, our analysis includes a method for reducing excited state
contamination to pion three-point functions by isolating the forward propagating pion for lattices with anti-periodic
fermionic boundary conditions in time.

By way of introduction, we review the decomposition of hadron masses into the quark and gluon contributions and

the scalar matrix elements of interest. The starting point is the energy momentum tensor of QCD [17–19]

Since −T44 is the Hamiltonian density, in the rest frame of the hadron H, (cid:104)T44(cid:105)H = −MH gives the mass while
(cid:104)Tij(cid:105)H = (cid:104)T4i(cid:105)H = 0. This means that in any Lorentz frame:

mH = −(cid:104)Tµµ(cid:105)H =

The terms are grouped into scale invariant combinations [25]: (cid:104)Hm(cid:105)H , the quark mass contribution, (cid:104)Hkin(cid:105)H , arising
from the quark and gluon kinetic energies and (cid:104)Ha(cid:105)H from the trace anomaly. Comparison with Eq. (4) demonstrates
that knowledge of the sigma terms σH
q = mq(cid:104)¯qq(cid:105)H and mH is suﬃcient to determine all three components. We remark
that the individual (scale dependent) quark and gluon kinetic energies can be computed on the lattice, however, this
is not attempted here. In a theory with only two light quarks, q = u, d, then (cid:104)Hm(cid:105)N = σN
d = σπN for the
nucleon. We deﬁne σπ
d = σπ for the light quark pion sigma term. Early estimates, employing Eq. (4) and SU(3)
ﬂavour symmetry breaking of baryon octet masses [26] suggested σπN ∼ 26 MeV, while σπ ∼ mπ/2 can be inferred
from the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner (GMOR) relation and the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, σH
q = mq∂mH /∂mq (this
was noted in Refs. [27–29] and conﬁrmed in Ref. [29] at mπ = 281 MeV). Using σπN ∼ 35 MeV ∼ 0.04 mN , which is
close to the result presented later in this paper, we have the decompositions for Nf = 2 QCD:

reﬂecting the diﬀerent impact of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the two cases, i.e. mN > 0 for mq = 0.
These decompositions will be modiﬁed in the presence of the sea quarks s, c, b, t. While the sigma terms for the light
and strange quarks, q = u, d, s, must be determined via non-perturbative methods one can appeal to the heavy quark
limit in order to evaluate σc,b,t. Following Ref. [1], in the eﬀective theory the heavy quark (h) term mh¯hh, to leading

In a naive picture of the proton with only valence quarks z = 1.5. Using Gell-Mann-Okubo mass relations, Ref. [26]
estimated this to be only slightly modiﬁed to 1.49 in the presence of sea quarks. The individual light and strange
quark sigma terms can be obtained from diﬀerent combinations of σ0, z and σπN . In the past, estimates of σ0 and
σπN from ChPT and z = 1.49 have been used for this purpose, see, for example, Ref. [4].

This paper is organized as follows: in the next section we provide details of the simulation including the lattice set-up
and the construction of the connected and disconnected quark line diagrams needed for the computation of the pion and
nucleon scalar matrix elements. These matrix elements typically suﬀer from signiﬁcant excited state contamination.
The ﬁtting procedures employed to ensure the ground states are extracted reliably is discussed in Sections II B and II C,
for the pion and the nucleon, respectively. Some of the quantities given above require renormalisation due to the
explicit breaking of chiral symmetry for our lattice fermion action. The relevant renormalisation factors are detailed in
Section II D. Our ﬁnal results for the sigma terms, including mass and volume dependence are presented in Section III
for the pion and, also including lattice spacing eﬀects, for the nucleon in Section IV. For the latter a comparison is
made with other recent lattice determinations by direct and indirect (via the Feynman-Hellmann theorem) methods

and also other theoretical results in Section V. We conclude in Section VI. For the sake of brevity, our conventions for
the deﬁnition of the energy-momentum tensor are collected in Appendix A. For the pion, in order to reduce excited
state contamination, we construct the relevant two- and three-point functions from quark propagators with both
period and anti-periodic boundary conditions in time. This approach is discussed in Appendix B. Finally, the ﬁnite
volume chiral perturbation theory expressions we use when investigating ﬁnite size eﬀects on the sigma terms and
nucleon mass are given in Appendix C.

II. SIMULATION DETAILS

A. Lattice set-up and methods

The analysis was performed on Nf = 2 ensembles using the Wilson gauge action with non-perturbatively im-
proved clover fermions generated by QCDSF and the Regensburg lattice QCD group (RQCD). A wide range of pion
masses (mπ = 490 MeV down to 150 MeV) and spatial lattice extents (Lmπ = 3.4 up to 6.7) were realized over a

nucleon. The quark contractions give a relative minus sign between the diagrams. Note that for scalar matrix elements, the
vacuum expectation value of the current insertion needs to be subtracted (¯qq (cid:55)→ ¯qq − (cid:104)¯qq(cid:105)), see Eqs. (3) and (14). The blue

limited range of lattice spacings (a = 0.08 fm to 0.06 fm). The scale was set using the value r0 ≈ 0.5 fm at vanishing
quark mass, obtained by extrapolating the nucleon mass to the physical point (within our range of a) [32]. Table I
gives details of the ensembles and Fig. 1 illustrates the range of volumes available for each pion mass.

The full set of ensembles was used in the determination of the nucleon scalar matrix elements enabling a constrained
approach to the physical point and a thorough investigation of ﬁnite volume eﬀects using three spatial extents with
mπ ∼ 290 MeV at ﬁxed lattice spacing. Discretisation eﬀects are O(a2) for some non-singlet combinations of scalar
currents and O(a) for others (see Section II D). The latter being due to mixing with the gluonic operator aF 2 [33]
or O(amq) terms. Note that mixing with aF 2 is present also for other actions such as the twisted mass (including
maximal twist) and overlap actions. No clear indication of signiﬁcant discretisation eﬀects are seen in our results,
however, a (a2) only varies by a factor 1.3 (1.8) in our simulations and, hence, this cannot be checked decisively.

A further source of systematic uncertainty is excited state contamination. As in our studies of nucleon isovector
quantities [31, 34] a careful investigation of excited state contributions is performed, see Sections II B and II C for the
pion and nucleon, respectively. This is an important issue for our analysis of pion scalar matrix elements, since terms
arising from multi-pion states which propagate around the temporal boundary can dominate the three-point function
if the temporal extent of the lattice is not large. In particular, for the near physical point ensemble the temporal
extent of the lattice is only T ∼ 4.58 fm ≈ 3.5/mπ. Our method for reducing this contribution and ensuring ground
state dominance, detailed in Appendix B, was applied to four ensembles (labelled III, IV, V and VIII in Table I) at
one lattice spacing a = 0.07 fm. The pion mass is varied between 420 MeV and 150 MeV and a limited study of ﬁnite
size eﬀects is possible through the use of two volumes with Lmπ = 3.4 and 4.2 for mπ = 290 MeV.

High statistics was achieved in all cases and the signals of the required two-point and three-point functions were
further improved by performing multiple measurements per conﬁguration using diﬀerent source positions. This is
necessary in particular for scalar matrix elements since the intrinsic gauge noise can be substantial. The isoscalar
three-point functions contain both connected and disconnected quark line contributions, as shown in Fig. 2, with the
latter dominating the noise. Eight measurements of the disconnected diagrams were performed on each conﬁguration
compared to two measurements for the connected part. Signal to noise ratios are worse for coarser lattice spacings
and for smaller pion masses and the number of determinations of the connected terms was increased to 4 and 3 for
ensembles I (mπ = 280 MeV with a ∼ 0.08 fm) and VIII (150 MeV, a = 0.07 fm), respectively. For the nucleon the
connected terms were generated as part of a previous study of isovector charges [34]. The number of disconnected
measurements was not increased due to the computational cost and the limited reduction in error due to correlations
within the data. Measurements performed on the same conﬁguration are averaged and binning over conﬁgurations
was applied to a level consistent with four times the integrated autocorrelation time.

In the two ﬂavour theory the strange quark is quenched and the size of the corresponding systematic uncertainty
is diﬃcult to quantify (note that the dominant strange quark contribution can still be computed, c.f., for example,
Eq. (10)). This source of uncertainty will be removed in future work on Nf = 2 + 1 conﬁgurations generated as part

The interpolators H = (uT Cγ5d)u and ¯uγ5d for the nucleon and pion, respectively, create both ground and excited
states with contributions which fall oﬀ exponentially with the energy of the state in Euclidean time. To improve the
overlap with the ground state, spatially extended interpolators were constructed using Wuppertal smeared [36, 37]
light quarks with spatially APE smoothed gauge transporters [38]. The number of Wuppertal smearing iterations
applied, nsm, shown in Table I, was optimized for each ensemble such that ground state dominance was achieved at
similar physical times for diﬀerent light quark masses and lattice spacings, see Ref. [34] for more details.

3pt(tf , t, ti), shown in Fig. 2 for the nucleon. The standard sequential source method is employed to determine the
connected diagram. This provides the three-point function at all t ∈ [ti + 2a, tf − 2a] for ﬁxed tf , where the minimal
distance 2a from source and sink is due to the use of clover fermions. Table II details the values of tf chosen (relative
to a source at the origin, i.e. ti = 0). For the nucleon the relative statistical errors of C conn
increase rapidly with
3pt
increasing tf − ti, motivating small source-sink separations. However, several tf values are needed to check for excited
state contributions which, as we will see in Sections II B and II C, are signiﬁcant for scalar matrix elements, even
with optimized spatially extended interpolators. In the pion case, the signal does not decay rapidly with tf and we
choose tf = T /2. This has the advantage that C3pt(tf , t, ti) can be averaged over the regions with ti = 0 < t < tf and
tf < t < ti = T . Excited state contributions are controlled using our method discussed in Appendix B.

The disconnected term is constructed from a disconnected “loop” L(t) and a two-point function computed on each

conﬁguration:

The quark propagator M−1(x, x) is estimated stochastically using 25 complex Z2 random source vectors that are
non-zero on 8 timeslices. This number of stochastic estimates and level of time partitioning for L(t) ensured the
additional random noise introduced to C dis

determine both the light and the strange quark content of the nucleon and pion, the loop Lc(t) is evaluated both for
κ(cid:96) and κs and contracted with the two-point function constructed from light quark propagators. For the nucleon, as
we will see in Section II C, the statistical noise increases rapidly with increasing source-operator insertion separations

B. Pion three-point function ﬁts

Pion three-point functions calculated on ensembles with anti-periodic boundary conditions in time can suﬀer from
large contributions involving a backward propagating pion (across the boundary) in combination with a forward
propagating scalar state, if the temporal extent of the lattice is not large and the pion mass is close to the physical
value, as is the case, for example, for ensemble VIII (see Table I). These contributions and our method for reducing
them are discussed in detail in Appendix B. We utilize correlation functions computed using quark propagators with
diﬀerent temporal boundary conditions (periodic and anti-periodic) to isolate the forward propagating negative parity
terms. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 for the two-point function on two representative ensembles with mπ = 289 MeV and
150 MeV. The expected time dependence of the “improved” two-point function, smeared at the source and sink (SS),
is given by Eq. (B15),

where ti = 0, Znm = Z∗mn = (cid:104)n|H|m(cid:105). For simplicity we use the normalization convention (cid:104)m|n(cid:105) = δm,n, rather than

excitations. We label the negative parity states by odd numbers where E1 and E3 are the masses of the ground state
pion and a “three-pion” (or excited pion) state, respectively. The latter association is made since in nature the excited
state pion is much heavier in mass. Similarly, the positive parity states are represented by even numbers and E2 is the

mass of a (scalar) “two-pion” state. Figure 4 demonstrates that the contributions from the three-pion state (and higher
negative parity states) die oﬀ rapidly due to the optimized smearing and that ground state dominance sets in around
tf = 10a ≈ 0.7 fm for both ensembles, independent of the pion mass, and continues until tf ∼ 40a ≈ 2.8 fm. However,
for larger tf values the terms arising from scalar states propagating across the boundary become signiﬁcant. This can
be seen in the combination C improv
(tf , 0), divided by the ground state contribution, |Z01|2e−mπtf , as determined from
a ﬁt, shown on the right in Fig. 4. For tf /a (cid:38) 40 this ratio (equal to the expression within the square brackets in
Eq. (17)) increases from 1, with the deviation becoming more signiﬁcant for smaller mπ. This motivates us to restrict
tf /a ≤ 40 in order to avoid similar terms when ﬁtting to the pion three-point functions.
The connected three-point function is shown in Fig. 5 as a ratio with the two-point function for the four ensembles
used in the pion analysis, with mπ = 422 MeV down to 150 MeV. In the mass-degenerate Nf = 2 theory (cid:104)1|¯uu|1(cid:105)conn =
(cid:104)1| ¯dd|1(cid:105)conn and only a single three-point function needs to be considered. Smeared sources and sinks are implemented
and the sink time tf is ﬁxed to T /2. Using standard correlation functions, the ratio has the functional form,3 0 ≤ t ≤ tf ,

The considerable size of these contributions can be seen by comparing the improved and unimproved ratios, as shown
in Fig. 5. The diﬀerence between the two cases becomes even more dramatic as mπ decreases from 422 MeV down
to 150 MeV. For Rimprov,conn one can extract (cid:104)1|S|1(cid:105)conn by ﬁtting to a constant (B1) for small |tf /2 − t|. Examples
of such ﬁts are indicated by the blue regions in Fig. 5. However, the ﬁtting range can be extended by including the

e−tf ∆E = e−(T−tf )E2 ∼ 0.03 for the lightest pion mass ensemble, suggesting this assumption is reasonable. However,
data with diﬀerent tf would be needed to conﬁrm this.

and C2pt leads to a value for
(cid:104)1|S|1(cid:105)conn consistent with the improved result, albeit with larger statistical errors, see Fig. 5. The terms appearing
in the numerator of Eq. (19) will dominate and one can see that C conn
3pt will have the same time dependence as in
Eq. (22), replacing ∆E by E2. If we assume that these eﬀects only depend on T mπ, which is approximately 9.8 for
this ensemble, then T (cid:46) 180a ∼ 12.8 fm would be required at mπ = 150 MeV in order to ensure (cid:104)1|S|1(cid:105)conn can be

reliably extracted using standard correlators at tf = T /2. Having three-point functions with multiple tf can help,
however, at least one tf value must be large enough that the unwanted terms are signiﬁcantly suppressed.

For the analysis of the disconnected contribution the three-point function has been computed for both S = ¯uu ( ¯dd)
and ¯ss at multiple current insertion times and for all sink times. In Fig. 6 we again consider the ratio with the two-point
function for the improved and unimproved cases with a strange quark loop for ensembles III and VIII (mπ = 422 MeV
and 150 MeV, respectively). Note that the correlators are smeared at the source and the sink. Including only the
vacuum and pion state in the spectral decompositions of the correlators, the unimproved ratio has the time dependence,

independent of t. From Eq. (23), for small tf > t, one expects Rdis ∼ (cid:104)1|S|1(cid:105)dis − (cid:104)0|S|0(cid:105)dis. As tf increases the
ratio should to drop to half of its value at tf = T /2 and continue to tend to zero, if contributions from states
|2(cid:105),|3(cid:105), . . . are small. This behaviour is seen in Fig. 6 (top left) for the mπ = 422 MeV ensemble in the limit of large
t < tf ≤ T /2. However, when the pion mass is decreased the terms arising from the backward propagating pion across
the boundary (with forward propagating scalar |2(cid:105)), given in Eqs. (B5) and (B6), become very large and Rdis does not
drop oﬀ signiﬁcantly, as shown in Fig. 6 (top left) for mπ = 150 MeV. Applying our improvement procedure, these
terms are removed and one expects simply Rimprov,dis(tf , t, 0) = (cid:104)1|S|1(cid:105)dis − (cid:104)0|S|0(cid:105)dis for tf (cid:28) T . As observed in
Fig. 6 (bottom), the improved ratio is constant for diﬀerent current insertion times up to tf ∼ 40a on both ensembles.
For larger tf values, terms involving a backward propagating scalar particle cannot be ignored anymore.

In order to extract (cid:104)1|S|1(cid:105)dis − (cid:104)0|S|0(cid:105)dis we perform three types of ﬁts to Rimprov,dis: for SS correlators we ﬁt the
ratio to a constant and, whenever the next order terms can be resolved, also to a functional form which includes a
three-pion state (Eq. (B19)). The latter is also employed to ﬁt the ratio constructed from correlators smeared at the
source and local at the sink (SL), together with the SS ratio.4 As for the analysis of the connected part, the ﬁtting
range is varied with the restriction that the correlated χ2/d.o.f. < 2, the ﬁnal error taking into account the spread of
results from uncorrelated ﬁts due to diﬀerent ﬁt types and ranges. Representative examples of ﬁts are given in Fig. 7
for a disconnected three-point function with a light quark loop on ensemble V (mπ = 289 MeV).

C. Nucleon three-point function ﬁts

For the nucleon scalar matrix elements three-point functions have been computed on all ensembles shown in Table I.
For the connected part excited state contamination is explored using multiple sink times at three pion masses,
mπ = 426 MeV, 289 MeV and 150 MeV, at the lattice spacing a ≈ 0.071 fm. The standard ﬁt form for SS correlators

ﬁrst excited nucleon states |N1(cid:105) and |N2(cid:105), respectively. We denote the corresponding masses as m1 and m2 and
the mass diﬀerence as ∆m = m2 − m1. For the connected three-point function there are two contributions arising
from the scalar current S = ¯uu, inserted on a u quark line, and similarly for S = ¯dd, inserted on the d quark
line. Both contributions are ﬁtted simultaneously along with the two-point function to extract (cid:104)N1|¯uu|N1(cid:105)conn and
(cid:104)N1| ¯dd|N1(cid:105)conn, respectively. With data at several values of tf , see Table II, the last term in Eq. (25) can be resolved
as well as the dependence on the current insertion time t. Typical simultaneous ﬁts to two-point and multiple three-
point functions (including diﬀerent tf values and both the S = ¯uu and ¯dd contributions) are illustrated in Fig. 8 for
ensembles IV and VIII with mπ = 295 MeV and tf = 7a, 9a, 11a, 13a, 15a, 17a ∼ 0.5− 1.2 fm and mπ = 150 MeV and

last term in Eq. (25) which only depends on the sink time does not appear to be signiﬁcant for tf (cid:38) 13 ∼ 0.9 fm. This
can be seen in the top line of Fig. 8 from the consistency between the data with tf = 13a, 15a, 17a for mπ = 295 MeV
and tf = 13a, 15a for mπ = 150 MeV. Performing ﬁts to a single tf = 15a ∼ 1.1 fm (in this case the last term cannot
be distinguished from the ﬁrst term in Eq. (25)), we ﬁnd consistent results for the scalar matrix elements with the
multi-tf ﬁt results, as demonstrated in Fig. 8. This gives us conﬁdence that, for the interpolators employed, excited
state contamination can be accounted for in the analysis of the other ensembles where three-point functions were
generated with a single sink time tf (cid:38) 1.0 fm.

The disconnected scalar matrix element was extracted from the ratio of SS three-point and two-point functions. In
contrast to the pion, the signal deteriorates fairly rapidly for tf ∼ 1.5 fm, as seen in Fig. 9, and only the smallest two
values of the current insertion time t are useful, where tf > t. The ﬁgure also shows that excited state contributions
are small on the scale of the statistical errors and indeed ﬁts employing Eq. (B19) failed to resolve such terms. The SL
ratios were not included in the analysis as in this case the excited state contamination was too large to be modelled
by including only the ﬁrst excited state in the ﬁt function. For most ensembles, constant ﬁts were performed to the

SS ratios for the two values of t simultaneously. Statistical noise is larger for coarser lattice spacings and as the pion
mass decreases. For ensemble I (a ∼ 0.08 fm) only t = 4a ∼ 0.32 fm provided a reasonable signal, while for ensemble
VIII, mπ = 150 MeV, t = 5a and 11a are both noisy, however, we took the conservative choice to ﬁt to t = 11a.
In the same way as discussed for the analysis of the pion three-point functions in the previous section, the ﬁnal
results for both the connected and disconnected matrix elements include an estimate of the systematic uncertainty
arising from the ﬁtting procedure, obtained by varying the ﬁtting range.

D. Renormalisation

The renormalisation of the lattice scalar matrix elements in the Nf = 2 theory has already been discussed in detail
in Ref. [39] and we only repeat the relevant relations here. In the continuum the combination mq(cid:104)H|¯qq|H(cid:105) is invariant
under renormalisation group transformations. However, Wilson fermions explicitly break chiral symmetry and this
enables mixing with other quark ﬂavours. The renormalisation factor that determines the strength of this mixing is5
rm = Z s
m ) mass renormalisation factors. This ratio can be
determined non-perturbatively from the slope of the axial Ward identity quark mass ( ˜mq) as a function of the vector
Ward identity mass (mq), see, e.g, Ref. [33]:

The renormalisation pattern for the scalar matrix elements is the same for the pion and the nucleon. We consider

a general hadronic state |H(cid:105), with the abbreviation:

(cid:104)¯qq(cid:105)latt = (cid:104)H|¯qq|H(cid:105)latt − (cid:104)0|¯qq|0(cid:105)latt = (cid:104)H|¯qq|H(cid:105)latt,conn + (cid:104)H|¯qq|H(cid:105)latt,dis − (cid:104)0|¯qq|0(cid:105)latt.

refers to the current, integrated over space, and is dimensionless) will receive contributions ∝ a−31, however, these
cancel as we subtract the vacuum expectation value. Flavour singlet and non-singlet currents not only renormalize
diﬀerently but are also subject to diﬀerent O(a) improvement terms. In general, terms of the type bamq and a(cid:104)F 2(cid:105)
can be added, where the second term can only aﬀect ﬂavour-singlet combinations. In the Nf = 2 theory, the ﬁrst
type of term cancels from combinations like (mu + md)(cid:104)¯uu + ¯dd(cid:105) [33].

We remark that all the quantities in Eqs. (30) to (38) do not depend on a renormalisation scale. Considering
discretisation eﬀects, only z is automatically O(a) improved while all other observables are subject to O(a) lattice
artifacts. However, not all O(a) terms are likely to be large, for example, the a(cid:104)F 2(cid:105) term does not contribute to σ0
and if there is SU(3) ﬂavour symmetry in the sea then for asea ≈ 1 it cancels.

6 Here we use (cid:104)¯uu+ ¯dd(cid:105)dis = (cid:104)¯uu+ ¯dd(cid:105)−(cid:104)¯uu+ ¯dd(cid:105)conn. The full and connected matrix elements renormalize with Zs

III. PION SIGMA TERMS

Our ﬁnal results for the pion sigma terms for four ensembles at a = 0.071 fm are presented in Table IV and Fig. 11.
The central values are obtained by taking the average of the maximum and minimum of the sigma terms that result
from independently varying the ﬁt ranges of the connected and disconnected contributions and, where relevant, the
renormalisation factor rm ± δrm, where δrm is the error given in Table III. The systematic error is then half of the

This is added in quadrature to the statistical error arising from
typical ﬁts to the connected and disconnected terms (computed by combining the jackknife samples of the individual
contributions). For the pion sigma term in the inﬁnite volume limit, σ∞π , a further systematic arising from the ﬁnite
volume correction is added in quadrature corresponding to half the size of the correction applied.

17

As discussed in Section I, we expect σπ = mπ/2 for small pion masses. Fig. 11 shows this holds up to mπ of at
least 420 MeV. The 2.62 σ increase going from Lmπ = 3.42 (ensemble IV) to 4.19 (ensemble V) for mπ ∼ 290 MeV
suggests ﬁnite volume eﬀects may be an issue. ChPT provides a framework for evaluating these eﬀects, as detailed
in Appendix C. The sigma term increases in the inﬁnite volume limit, however, the corrections turn out to be very
small, well below the level of statistical signiﬁcance. The diﬀerence at mπ ∼ 290 MeV is only reduced to 2.55σ
for σ∞π , see Table IV. If the NLO ﬁnite volume formula (Eq. (C5)) is valid down to Lmπ = 3.4 then the diﬀerence
in the sigma terms can be ascribed to statistical variation. It is worth noting that without the use of our method
for reducing excited state contamination to the pion scalar matrix element (see Section II B and Appendix B) the
agreement with the GMOR expectation would not have been found. In particular, for the near physical point one
may obtain7 σπ ∼ 97 MeV.
The observed behaviour of σπ suggests the GMOR relation is valid over the same range of pion masses. This is
demonstrated in the bottom right panel of Fig. 11 where (m∞π )2 is shown as a function of the renormalized quark mass
(cid:46) 500 MeV gives a χ2/d.o.f. = 1.9 and a
for all ensembles. A ﬁt to the simple form (m∞π )2 = CmMS
slope C = −2Σ/F 2 = 5.04(1)(14) GeV, where Σ is the chiral condensate and F is the pion decay constant in the chiral
limit. The second error is due to the uncertainty in the non-perturbative renormalisation factors, given in Ref. [34].
Additional uncertainties, such as discretisation eﬀects and, clearly, higher orders in the quark mass expansion have not
been estimated (although given that χ2/d.o.f. = 1.9, these terms appear to be small). This slope compares favourably
with 2Σ/F 2 = −5.3(5) obtained using FLAG estimates [47] −Σ = (0.269(8) GeV)3 and Fπ/F = 1.0744(67) for the
Nf = 2 theory with Fπ = 92.2 MeV.
Recalling the decomposition of the mass of a hadron in Eq. (5), the u and d quark sigma term accounts for half the
mass of the pion, i.e. approximately 68 MeV at the physical point. From the ratio rsea in Fig. 11, we ﬁnd less than
15% of this is due to (light) sea quarks. While the disconnected terms are signiﬁcant, approximately 30% in size of the
connected terms, their contribution is reduced under renormalisation (Eq. (36)) since rm = Z s
m > 1. The strange
quark contribution to the pion mass is likely to be small, however, again due to cancellations under renormalisation,
the overall uncertainties are large and we ﬁnd σs < 50 MeV. Within errors, σs is also consistent with zero.

IV. NUCLEON σ TERMS

Starting with the pion-nucleon sigma term, our ﬁnal results on all ensembles are given in Table V and displayed as
a function of m2
π in Fig. 12 (left). The combined systematic and statistical errors are calculated as described in the
previous section for the pion. The sigma term tends to zero as expected as the pion mass is reduced with no signiﬁcant
dependence on the lattice spacing, but some variation with the volume at heavier mπ. Reasonable agreement is seen
with other recent direct determinations from ETMC [16, 48] and χQCD [15], in particular, close to the physical point.
These other (near) physical point simulations were performed at coarser lattice spacings, a ∼ 0.09 fm and 0.11 fm,
respectively, and in the case of the ETMC on smaller volumes in terms of Lmπ = 2.97 [49] and, for the χQCD study,
much lower statistics. We remark that O(a) discretisation errors arise for all fermion actions due to mixing with aF 2
and, so far, these eﬀects have not been removed.
The leading pion mass dependence of σπN is provided by the application of the Feynman-Hellmann theorem to the

NLO baryon ChPT expansion of the nucleon mass [51, 52],

III (Lmπ = 4.90). The diﬀerence in σπN for these two ensembles is 39(18) MeV, which is reduced to 24(22) MeV for

V and VII (Lmπ = 6.71) this is less so. However, all diﬀerences are within the expected range for statistical variations.
To test whether our statistically more precise results at mπ (cid:38) 260 MeV are consistent with the near physical

a and b determined from the ﬁt and (b) a − bm∞π + c(m∞π )2 ln(m∞π /λ), setting λ = 1 GeV and with b ﬁxed using
gA/Fπ = 13.88(29) GeV−1 [34]. The ﬁt range is the same throughout, mπ (cid:46) 420 MeV (including the 150 MeV point),
which gives us roughly three pion mass values, see Fig. 12 (right). Higher orders in the expansion are needed to include
the mπ ∼ 500 MeV data point. Fig. 12 (right) shows both ﬁts give consistent results at the physical point, only slightly
below the central value for mπ ∼ 150 MeV, with a = 0.037(3) GeV, b = 0.031(9) and χ2/d.o.f. = 1.0 for ﬁt (a) and
a = 0.039(3) GeV, c = −0.33(2) GeV−1 and χ2/d.o.f. = 1.1 for ﬁt (b). The slope from ﬁt (a) is signiﬁcantly smaller

together with the insigniﬁcant remaining extrapolation, motivates us to quote σ

One can also extract the individual light quark sigma terms, σq=u,d and the non-singlet combination σ0 (Eq. (34)).
We apply the same ﬁnite volume corrections to σ0 as for σπN , since the strange contribution is sub-leading, while for
σq we correct in proportion to the fraction σq/σπN . The ﬁnal results in all cases, given in Table VI, are taken from
ensemble VIII after rescaling with (mphys

sigma terms by the nucleon mass in the isospin limit8 mN = 938.6 MeV. Note that the central value for σ0 evaluated

error. The wrong ordering of the central values of σ0 and σπN is due to the fact that the central value for σs comes
out negative at mπ = 150 MeV, see Fig. 13, with a very large error. At heavier quark masses the expected ordering
is respected.

The strange quark content of the nucleon is encoded in σs (fTs) and the y ratio. The large cancellations under
renormalisation, mentioned previously, mean our values are not so precise. Figure 13 shows that there is a fairly large
spread in our results, although this does not depend signiﬁcantly on the pion mass, lattice spacing or volume. Due to
the large uncertainty on the near physical point ensemble we opt to extrapolate the mπ (cid:46) 420 MeV results to mphys
using (a) a ﬁt to a constant and (b) a ﬁt including a constant plus linear term in m2
π. The central values and errors of
the ﬁnal results in Table VI are computed using the average and half of the diﬀerence, respectively, of the maximum
and minimum values at mphys

obtained considering the ±1σ error bands of both ﬁts.

π

Apart from the ETMC [48] Nf = 2+1+1 result, which is somewhat low, other recent determinations of fTs displayed
in Fig. 13 are in agreement with our ﬁts, including those at the physical point. Note that, due to the symmetry
properties of the twisted mass (at maximal twist) and overlap actions used by ETMC and χQCD, respectively, there
is no mixing of quark ﬂavours for the scalar current and σs (fTs ) is only multiplicatively renormalized leading to
reduced uncertainty in their results. The use of domain wall fermions (Engelhardt [55]) is similarly advantageous.

For the y ratio the ETMC [54] Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 results give y ∼ 0.05 for mπ (cid:38) 300 MeV. The ratio increases as the

pion mass reduces and they obtain y = 0.173(50) on extrapolation to mphys
. This is higher than the physical point
determinations of the ETMC at Nf = 2 [16] and χQCD for Nf = 2 + 1 [15]. Our results are generally higher but
given the large errors the diﬀerence is not signiﬁcant.

(cid:80)

Also of interest are the c, b and t quark fractions as these are non-negligible due to the large quark masses
accompanying the scalar matrix element. As mentioned in the Introduction, in the heavy quark limit the heavy quark
fractions can be expressed in terms of fTG = 1−
q=u,d,s fTq , to leading order in 1/mh and α [1], see Eq. (7). Beyond
leading order in α the relation between fTG and the light quark fractions and also between fTG and fTc,b,t is modiﬁed.
The relevant α3 matching expressions from a theory with Nf light quarks to one with an additional heavy quark
are given in Refs. [6, 53]. We utilize the full result for fTc, for which the strong coupling at the relevant scale mc is
largest, while for fTb and fTt we truncate after O(α), arriving at the values given in Table VI. The perturbative error
is taken to be half the diﬀerence with the leading order value, i.e. (2/27)fTG . This is included in the total uncertainty
quoted in Table VI. Perturbative matching of Nf = 3 to Nf = 4 QCD in the heavy quark approximation at the scale
mc may be considered unreliable since neither αMS(mc) ≈ 0.39 nor Λ/mc are particularly small parameters in this
case. However, the ﬁrst non-perturbative matching results are very encouraging [58]. Direct determination of these
fractions is diﬃcult, due to the large statistical uncertainty and systematics involved, such as discretisation eﬀects.
The recent results for fTc, shown in Fig. 14, are consistent with our value fTc = 0.075(4).

In total, the quarks represent(cid:80)

q=u,d,s,c,b,t fTq = 0.291(15) or 273 MeV of the nucleon mass. The mass decompo-

sition, Eq. (5), now reads for the Nf = 6 theory:

mN ≈ (0.29 mN )m + (0.53 mN )kin + (0.18 mN )a .

(42)

For the ﬁrst term, ∼ 35 MeV is due to the light quarks (σπN ) and roughly the same amount comes from the strange
quark (σs), the rest is due in almost equal parts from the charm, bottom and top quarks. Note that at a low energy
scale these heavy quark contributions are indistinguishable from the kinetic part: the matching to the Nf + 1 theory
was performed, assuming that the nucleon mass is not aﬀected by the existence of, e.g., the top quark. Nevertheless,
the Higgs (where in Eq. (9) αq ∝ mq) at small recoil will couple to this fraction of the nucleon mass, including
the contributions from all the heavy ﬂavours. Since the heavy ﬂavour scalar matrix elements alone are very small,

would be negligible. Comparing Eq. (42) with the Nf = 2 theory, Eq. (6), the anomaly contribution is relatively
unchanged, while the kinetic term is decreased to compensate for the larger quark mass term.

One can decompose the sigma terms further and compare sea and valence quark contributions. The ratios asea and
rsea, shown in Fig. 15, indicate that the sea is approximately SUF (3) symmetric, while the light quark sea accounts
for less than 30% of the total light quark contribution. Again, there is a fairly large spread in our results but no
signiﬁcant dependence on pion mass, volume or lattice spacing. Furthermore, one can look at isospin asymmetry in
the form of the z ratio and the σu − σd diﬀerence (as a ratio with σπN = σu + σd), both given in Fig. 16. Here, the
results are more precise and the insensitivity to the simulation parameters, in particular, the pion mass, is clear. As
discussed in Section I, z in combination with σπN and σ0 is often used in the literature to predict fTq=u,d,s . Fits to a
π in the range mπ (cid:46) 420 MeV give values for z at the physical point
constant and constant plus a term linear in m2
consistent with the results from ensemble VIII. In keeping with the analysis for σπN and σ0, the latter values are used
for z at mphys
. We ﬁnd z = 1.258(81), which is 3σ below the expectation of 1.49 [26] from the SU(3) ﬂavour symmetry
breaking of octet baryon masses. Similarly, (σu − σd)/(σu + σd) = 0.12(4) is signiﬁcantly below 1/3, obtained from
simple quark counting. The physical point results for all quantities discussed above are displayed in Table VI.

V. COMPARISON WITH OTHER RECENT DETERMINATIONS OF σπN AND fTs

In Fig. 17 we compare our results and other direct determinations of σπN and fTs with those extracted via the
Feynman-Hellmann theorem. The latter indirect evaluations need to determine the slope of the nucleon mass at the
physical point in terms of the light and the strange quark masses. This requires simulations which ideally include quark
masses which are varied around the physical values. For light quarks this is usually missing due to the computational

using the Feynman-Hellmann theorem we have included the work of BMW-c [59, 60], Shanahan et al. [61], QCDSF [62], Ren
et al. [63], Alvarez-Ruso et al. [64], Lutz and Semke [65], Lutz et al. [66] and ETMC [67, 68]. Direct determinations are
displayed from QCDSF [32, 39], χQCD [15] and ETMC [16]. For fTs , the Feynman-Hellmann results shown are from BMW-
c [59, 60], Shanahan et al. [61], QCDSF [62], Ren et al. [63, 69], JLQCD [70], Lutz and Semke [65], Jung [71], Junnarkar and
Walker-Loud [72] and Lutz et al. [66]. The direct evaluations were performed by QCDSF [39], Freeman and Toussaint [56],
ETMC [16, 48], Engelhardt [55], JLQCD [70] and χQCD [15, 57]. RQCD refers to the present article.

cost while for strange quarks the mass is normally kept ﬁxed as the physical point is approached. A notable exception
is the recent work of BMW-c [60]. These problems are reﬂected in the larger variation in the results compared to
the direct methods, in particular, for fTs. As remarked above, the direct evaluations are consistent and favour small
values for σπN ∼ 35 − 45 MeV and fTs
Alternative approaches involve the analysis of pion-nucleon scattering data. Results for σπN include, for example,
45(8) MeV from Gasser et al. [10], 64(7) MeV from Pavan et al. [11], 59(7) MeV from Alarcon et al. [73] and 52(7) MeV
from Chen et al. [74], all employing ChPT and most recently 59.1(3.5) MeV from Hoferichter et al. [13, 14] using
a dispersive method (see also references in [14]). As can be seen from Fig. 17, σπN ∼ 60 MeV is somewhat above
the direct lattice results. In the Roy Steiner analysis of scattering data presented in Ref. [14] not only the scalar
formfactor and its slope near the Chen-Dashen (CD) point are determined but also ChPT low energy constants are
obtained by matching the ChPT expressions to the sub-threshold parameters [75]. From the slope and the formfactor
at the CD point the sigma term is estimated neglecting corrections that are formally of order m2
N . The low energy
constants extracted from πN scattering data enable a detailed comparison with lattice results, also away from the
physical point. In view of approximations made in various of the above analyses, the convergence of ChPT expansions
at or near the physical pion mass, clearly, is of great interest.

π/m2

First we carry out a consistency check of our σπN data, shown in Fig 18: we compare our nucleon masses (corrected
for ﬁnite size eﬀects, incorporating systematic errors, in the same way as for the sigma term) with the expectation
obtained by integrating the phenomenological (a − bmπ)m2
π parametrization of our σπN values (see Section IV) as
a function of m2
π (inverse Feynman-Hellmann method). The integration constant is adjusted so that the curve goes
through the central value of the smallest pion mass point. Modulo the coarsest lattice point (β = 5.2, a = 0.08 fm)
the parametrization describes the nucleon mass behaviour very well. However, it is clear from the ﬁgure that from a
global ﬁt to the nucleon mass data alone it would have been diﬃcult to obtain the slope at the physical pion mass
reliably in a parametrization independent way, unless data at smaller than physical pion masses were available. Note
that such a Feynman-Hellmann study from BMW-c found σπN = 38(3)(3) MeV [60], in agreement with our direct
evaluation.

where ¯l3 = 3.41(41), is directly compared with our results. Unlike the nucleon mass, the sigma term is very sensitive
to the value of e1, as indicated by the shaded region in the ﬁgure. Clearly, the convergence of ChPT appears to be
even inferior to that for the nucleon mass, at least for mπ ≥ mphys
. Discussions on the application of ChPT to the
determination of σπN can be found, for example, in Ref. [76].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we performed a high statistics study of the pion and nucleon sigma terms with Nf = 2 dynamical
non-perturbatively improved clover fermions for pion masses ranging from mπ ∼ 500 MeV down to close to the
physical point. The set of ensembles available enabled a study of volume dependence (Lmπ = 3.42− 6.71) and, for the
nucleon, also of lattice spacing eﬀects (a = 0.06− 0.08 fm) for mπ (cid:38) 260 MeV. Finite volume corrections derived from
ChPT turn out to be small, in particular, close to the physical point, and any remaining volume dependence could be
ascribed to statistics. Similarly, for nucleon observables discretisation eﬀects were not discernible, although leading
O(a) terms are expected for most quantities and our lattice spacings only vary over a limited range. Extrapolations
of the nucleon sigma term data using simple forms for the chiral behaviour gave consistent results with those obtained
at the near physical point and we used these mπ ∼ 150 MeV values to form the ﬁnal results for quantities dominated
by light quarks, such as σπN and σq=u,d, summarized in Table VI. For the strange quark sigma terms and ratios, σs,
fTs and y, our results are not so precise due to large cancellations under renormalisation for Wilson type fermions

9 The lower limit can be obtained by extrapolating from the mπ ∼ 150 MeV point using σπN = −4c1m2
higher order corrections that are in the opposite direction.

at our moderate lattice spacings and we quote ﬁnal values obtained by extrapolation of the very mild quark mass
dependence from mπ (cid:38) 260 MeV to the physical point.

A careful analysis procedure was implemented to extract the connected and disconnected quark line scalar matrix
elements to ensure excited state contamination is minimized.
In particular, for the pion this involved removing
multi-pion states which propagate around the boundary and can contribute signiﬁcantly if the temporal extent of the
lattice is not very large. This improvement enabled us to show the GMOR expectation σπ = mπ/2 is valid up to
mπ ∼ 420 MeV consistent with the GMOR behaviour of the pion mass as a function of the renormalized quark mass
over the same range. The improvement technique may also be useful in the evaluation of other pion matrix elements.
Our study shows that with σπN = 35(6) MeV, the light quarks contribute very little to the mass of the nucleon.
About 30% of this 3–4% fraction is due to light sea quarks. The strange quark contribution, σs = 35(12) MeV is
similarly small. Appealing to the heavy quark limit, we utilized the α3 perturbative matching results [6, 53] between
a theory of Nf light quarks and one containing an additional heavy quark in order to evaluate the mass contributions
from the charm, bottom and top quarks. These contributions are signiﬁcantly larger than for the light and strange
quarks due to the large quark masses in the combinations mh(cid:104)¯hh(cid:105). Overall, the quarks contribute about 29% of the
mass, with the kinetic energies of the quarks and gluons and the anomaly accounting for 53% and 18%, respectively,
see Eq. (42).
In Table VI we also provide values for σ0 and z. Estimates of these quantities and of σπN from
(non-lattice) approaches are sometimes used in the literature to predict fTq=u,d,s .

Good agreement was found for most quantities with other direct determinations involving diﬀerent quark actions,
pion masses, numbers of dynamical ﬂavours, lattice spacings and volumes, in particular for σπN and fTs , displayed
in Fig. 17, determined around the physical point. These determinations favour small values for both quantities
compared to, for example, σπN = 59.1(3.5) MeV from Hoferichter et al. [13, 14] from a dispersive analysis of pion-
nucleon scattering data. The pion-nucleon sigma term gives the slope of the nucleon mass as a function of m2
π via
the Feynman-Hellmann theorem. We showed our values for the sigma terms describe the nucleon mass data up to
mπ ∼ 420 MeV, providing a consistency check of the results. In contrast, the heavy baryon ChPT expansion did
not seem to be well controlled above the physical point. Direct lattice calculation is the most theoretically clean
approach to evaluate the sigma terms. Improvements in techniques have led to an increase in the statistical precision
for σπN and fTs determined in this way and this must be accompanied by a thorough investigation of the systematics.
Future calculations will involve Nf = 2 + 1 simulations on CLS ensembles [35] with open boundaries to remove the
uncertainty of omitting the strange quark in the sea (although this is not expected to be a dominant eﬀect) and to
achieve smaller lattice spacings for which the cancellations in fTs under renormalisation are less severe. In addition,
discretisation and ﬁnite volume eﬀects will be addressed systematically also for small pion masses.

J P = 0−, the overlap matrix (cid:104)n|H(0)|m(cid:105) can link any (single- or multi-particle) states |n(cid:105) and |m(cid:105) with J = 0 if
and only if the states have opposite parity and ∆I = 1. Similarly, the matrix element (cid:104)n|S(0)|m(cid:105) for the scalar
operator S = ¯qq is non-zero for n and m with the same parity, J, isospin and strangeness. We denote the even states,
|0(cid:105),|2(cid:105),|4(cid:105), . . . and the odd states, |1(cid:105),|3(cid:105),|5(cid:105) . . ., where |0(cid:105) represents the vacuum and |1(cid:105) the ground state pion. Since
the lowest lying single-particle 0+ state11 is heavier in mass than 2mπ and the radially excited pion lies above 1 GeV
then |n(cid:105) can be thought of as an n-pion multi-particle state for small n. Considering only n ≤ 2 to begin with, the

the energy of state |n(cid:105). Note that the expressions above are relevant for correlators generated with the same source
and sink interpolator, for example, smeared-smeared (SS) two- and three-point functions. Corrections to ground
state dominance involve terms arising from a forward propagating pion state together with a scalar (two-pion) state
propagating backward around the temporal boundary and vice versa. Depending on the size of the overlaps and
matrix elements, some of the terms in Eq. (B6) can be large for tf (cid:38) T /2, in particular since E2 is rather small, for
example, 2amπ ≈ 0.11 for ensemble VIII in Table II.
Contributions involving an odd parity state propagating across the boundary in the backward direction can be
removed by constructing correlation functions from quark propagators with diﬀerent boundary conditions in time.
For example, the two-point function with the spectral decomposition of Eq. (B5) is computed using

C2pt(tf , 0) =

where both propagators, M−1((cid:126)x, tf ;(cid:126)0, 0), have anti-periodic boundary conditions (AP) in time imposed. If instead one
of the propagators has periodic boundary conditions (P), then the two-point function for this AP-P combination will

reasonable as demonstrated in Fig. 4 which shows the deviation of improved two-point functions from ground state
dominance for ensembles with mπ = 289 MeV and mπ = 150 MeV. Excited state contributions are small and drop
below the noise for tf (cid:46) 10a.

The connected and disconnected contributions to the three-point function are analysed individually. Equations (B6),
(B14), (B18) and (B19) give the functional forms of the disconnected part, which includes the subtraction of (cid:104)0|S|0(cid:105).

1, 2, 3. Also in Eq. (B6) the subtracted term in the last line is not present.
Finally, if diﬀerent interpolators are employed at source and sink, for example, connected or disconnected three-point

functions that are smeared at the source and local at the sink, then one cannot simplify,

and similar in Eqs. (B6), (B14), (B18) and (B19). Accordingly, in this case the functional forms must be modiﬁed to
allow for diﬀerent coeﬃcients for these pairs of terms.

Appendix C: Finite volume corrections to the nucleon and pion sigma terms

For convenience we collect the expressions used for applying ﬁnite volume corrections to the pion and nucleon sigma

terms. For the pion we use NLO ChPT [45, 46],

where λ = Lmπ, K1 is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind and (cid:126)n (cid:54)= (cid:126)0 is an integer valued vector.
Using the Feynman-Hellmann theorem and the GMOR relation we have for the ﬁnite volume pion sigma term,
σπ(L) = 2σu(L) = 2σd(L),

For the corrections to both the pion and nucleon sigma terms we estimate the error of the ﬁnite volume shifts to
be half the size of the correction applied. This is added in quadrature to the statistical and the other systematic
uncertainties.

The above formulae entail the pion mass in inﬁnite volume. This is obtained using the largest available volume for
each (β, κ) combination, the NNNLO analytic expressions of Ref. [44] and the low energy constants of Refs. [44, 47],
see Ref. [34] for details.
