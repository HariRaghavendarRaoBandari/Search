Slowing/stopping the light travelling in free space with electromagnetically induced transparency to imple-
ment the optical quantum information processings and store information has been paid much attention in recent
years. For the waveguide photons, here, we propose an approach to stop them with a controllable atomic cavity
generated by a pair of atomic mirrors; one of them reﬂects the photon completely and another one with the
adjustable reﬂected/transmitted probability of the photons. Based on the full quantum mechanical theory in real
space, we show that the reﬂected/transmitted probability of the waveguide photon with a ﬁxed frequency can
be controlled by adjusting the energy-splitting of the driven two-level atomic scatters (i.e., atomic mirrors). As
a consequence, the photon can be controllably transmitted/reﬂected along the waveguide by the aside atomic
mirrors with the adjustable atomic energy levels. Ideally, the photons could be stopped in the atomic cavity.
This provides a novel mechanism to stop/retravel the waveguide photon in a controllable ways. The feasibility
of the proposal with the current integrated optical devices is also discussed.

Single photons propagating is a basic and important subject
in quantum optics, and associates with many quantum infor-
mation and quantum computation processes [1–3]. And many
theoretical and experimental works are proposed to investi-
gate the processes of the single photons transporting in one-
dimension waveguide and coupling to two- and multi-level
quantum systems [4–8]. Following the investigations of sin-
gle photons propagating, some works on quantum-detection,
quantum-routing and quantum-switch of single photons in
one-dimension waveguide are proposed in theoretical and
even realized in experimental [9–14]. However, in these
schemes, the two- and multi-level quantum systems all have
the time-independent energy frequencies, which means we
can not adjust the detuning between the single photons and the
quantum systems when they are integrated in a chip. Mean-
while, the transmitted and reﬂected probabilities of the sin-
gle photons also can not be adjusted as convenient as we can.
How to perfectly solve this work is a challenge, and the time-
dependent quantum system must be needed.

In the past few years, the time-dependent quantum dy-
namics in low-dimensional systems are always attraction.
Many methods are proposed in theoretical to investigate the
time-dependent external ﬁelds controlling the quantum sys-
tem [15–17]. However, these investigations are mostly fo-
cus on the transporting of electrons [17, 18] and very little
on photons [19, 20]. Therefore, single photons propagating in
one-dimensional waveguide and coupling to a time-dependent
quantum system deserves more exploration. The investiga-
tions on transporting of electrons allow us to directly construct
the similar quantum scheme with energy variable atoms (spe-
cial artiﬁcial atoms).
In order to distinctly study transmis-
sion relationship in time-dependent quantum system, we pro-
pose a full quantum-mechanical approach to solve that sin-

gle photons couple to energy variable system (i.e. artiﬁcial
atom controlled by voltage or ﬂux) depending on time in one-
dimension waveguide. Because of the time-dependent quan-
tum system, the single photons will be separated into diﬀerent
sidebands and the total transmitted probability of the single
photons is the sum of the transmitted probability in each side-
band. The total transmitted probability is seriously depending
on the variable energy’s parameters, such as amplitude and
frequency of the vibration. Also this character lets the control
of the single photons transporting become more conveniently.

We present our model of a single photon coupling to the en-
ergy variable system in one-dimension waveguide, and calcu-
late the transmitted and reﬂected amplitudes in diﬀerent side-
bands.And show the analysis of the transmission spectra for
diﬀerent parameters and compare transmitted probabilities of
the zeroth and ﬁrst sideband. Finally, a feasible design is given

We consider a single-photon transporting in an one-
dimension waveguide, and being scattered by a time-
dependent aside ideal two-level quantum system (i.e., two-
level artiﬁcial atom). We sketch the entire scheme in Fig. 1,
and set the atom located at x0. Then the Hamiltonian can be
written as ( = 1) :

order to keep the coupling strength V unchangeable, the am-
plitude satisﬁes f ≪ 1. Because of considering an ideal quan-
tum system, we neglect the dissipations of the atom and the
waveguide.

waveguide and the atom stays at its ground state |0i. φR/L(x, t)
and e(t) stand for the time-dependent probabilistic amplitudes
of the photon propagating along the R/L direction and the
atomic excitation, respectively.

Substitute the functions Eqs. (1) and (2) into the time-

dependent Schrödinger equation

i∂t|Ψ(x, t)i = H|Ψ(x, t)i,

While the input single photon is scattered by the time-
dependent atom, some sidebands will be appeared. And the
single photon can be reﬂected and transmitted though these
sidebands with certain probabilities. The above probabilistic
amplitudes of the photon propagating along the R/L direction
can be further expressed as

φR(x, t) = θ(−x + x0)ei(q0 x−ω0t) + θ(x − x0)Xn

is the frequency (in n−th sideband) of the input single photon,
and q0 (qn) is the wave vector (in n−th sideband).

Without loss of the generality, we take x0 = 0 for simplicity.

with ∆ = ω0 − Ω, γ = V2/vg and ωn = ω0 + nω. Here, ∆ and
γ are the detuning and the eﬀective coupling strength between
the photon and time-dependent atom, respectively. Note that
γ, ∆ and ω all have the same unit as frequency, and eﬀective
coupling strength satisﬁes γ ≪ Ω.

Because of the periodical variation of the energy of the
atom, the transmitted and reﬂected amplitudes are separated
into several parts. Thus the total transmitted and reﬂected
probabilities should be written as:

R = Xn
T = Xn

|rn|2.

In the time-dependent quantum system, the transmitted and
reﬂected probabilities also satisfy: T + R = 1. In the follow-
ing section, we discuss the transmission spectra of the single
photon scattered by the time-dependent atom.

Here we will analyse the transmitted spectra of the single

photon by two cases: f ω = 0 and f ω , 0.

i) f ω = 0.

In this case, we can consider that the time-
dependent atom with very low frequency (i.e., ω ∼ 0) or very
trivial amplitude (i.e., f ∼ 0). Then the transmission spec-
tra are shown in Fig. 2. The blue solid line expresses that

the time-dependent atom has low frequency ω = 0 and un-
neglected the amplitude f Ω/γ = 5. Then we can ﬁnd that the
complete reﬂected point corresponding the detuning ∆/γ = 5.
In this case, the amplitude and the detuning satisﬁes f Ω = ∆,
which also obey the principle that the resonant input single
photon is complete reﬂected. The red dashed line show that
the time-dependent atom has trivial amplitude ( f = 0) and
nonzero frequency (ω , 0), and it has no diﬀerent with cou-
pling to a normal two-level atom with transmission frequency
Ω.

ii) f ω , 0. When the single photon is scattered by the time-
dependent atom, the transmission spectra have obvious diﬀer-
ence with the time-independent one. The transmission spectra
are shown in Fig. 3. In the Fig. 3 (a), we keep the frequency
unchanged (i.e.,ω/γ = 2), and adjust the amplitude f . For the
resonant input photon, the complete reﬂected phenomenon is
only corresponding the low amplitude (i.e., 0 < f Ω/γ < 2),
then the transmitted probability is increasing with the increas-
ing of the amplitude even reach complete transmission. For
the non-resonant input photon, there are also some summits
of reﬂection corresponding the relatively large detuning, and
that is diﬀerent form that nearly complete transmission when a
single photon couple to a time-independent atom. In the Fig. 3
(b), we keep the amplitude ﬁxing in f Ω/γ = 5, and adjust the
frequency ω. For the resonant input photon, the complete re-
ﬂected phenomenon is corresponding the relatively high fre-
quency (i.e., ω/γ > 6), and the transmitted probability is very
large for the low frequency. For the non-resonant input pho-
ton, there are also some obvious splits corresponding the low
frequency. Therefore, we can get that the anomalistic trans-
mission spectra correspond the large amplitude and low fre-
quency of the time-dependent atom. Note that the maximum
transmitted probabilities in Fig. 3 (a) and (b) are not 1, and
that is limited by the values of emulation parameters.

In order to further understand the scattering process for the
resonant input photons coupling to the time-dependent atom,
we investigate the transmitted probabilities in diﬀerent side-
bands as shown in Fig. 4. When a single resonant photon is
scattered by a time-independent atom, it is complete reﬂected.
For the time-dependent atom, it is related to the sideband scat-
tering. We ﬁx the amplitude in f Ω/γ = 5, and the transmis-
sion curves of the diﬀerent frequencies in diﬀerent sidebands

the time-dependent atom. (a) Take the amplitude f as the variable
parameter and ﬁx the frequency in ω/γ = 2. (b) Take the frequency
ω as the variable parameter and ﬁx the amplitude in f Ω/γ = 5.

are shown in Fig. 4 (a). The blue solid line describes the trans-
mitted probability T0 in zeroth sideband. We can ﬁnd that the
transmission mainly depends on the zero sidebands for the low
frequency and it is decreasing with the increasing of the fre-
quency. The red dashed line and the black dotted line show
the transmitted probabilities T1 and T2 in the ﬁrst and second
sideband, respectively. We also can see that the ﬁrst sideband
contribute more transmitted probability than the zeroth side-
band for the high frequency (i.e., ω/γ > 6) though the sec-
ond sideband has trivial contribution. In the Fig. 4 (b), we
show the transmitted probabilities with the amplitude param-
eter f while ﬁx the frequency in ω/γ = 2. Here, the trans-
mitted probability T0 (blue solid line) in zeroth sideband is
mainly increased with the increasing of the amplitude f , and
becomes the main part of total transmitted probability at the
large amplitude area (i.e., f Ω > 4). The transmitted proba-
bility in the ﬁrst sideband T1 (red dashed line) is larger than
that in the zeroth sideband corresponding the low amplitude
(i.e., f Ω/γ < 2). And there also is trivial transmitted proba-
bility in second sideband T2 (black dotted line), therefore, the
transmitted probabilities in high level sideband can even be
neglected.

In this paper, we investigate the single photons scattered
by the time-dependent quantum system in one-dimension
waveguide. We ﬁnd that the single photon coupling to time-
dependent two-level atom can product a lot of sidebands, and
these sidebands take the total transmitted probability diﬀerent
from the single photons transporting in one-dimension waveg-
uide coupling with time-independent two-level atom. The
complete reﬂection not always appeared at the resonant input
single photons, and even there can appear large transmitted

probabilities. We also investigate the contribution of trans-
mission in diﬀerent sidebands, and we ﬁnd the zeroth and the
ﬁrst sidebands contribute much more transmitted probabilities
than the other high level sidebands. Meanwhile, we show that
the ﬁrst sideband sometime play a more important role than
the zeroth sidebands in transmission when we care the high
frequency and low amplitude.

Immediately, the approach can demonstrate its utility in
optical quantum process, e.g., trap single photon see Fig. 5.
Here, we propose that time-dependent and time-independent

two-level atoms are located in the left and right, respectively.
When cancel the external control ﬁeld, we set the both quan-
tum systems are resonant with the input single photons. Let
the amplitude of the external ﬁeld is large enough at ﬁrst, so
the input single photons can be complete transmitted. When
the input photons transport the time-dependent (the left one)
atom, the external control ﬁeld is canceled. Because the single
photons can be complete reﬂected by the resonant two-level
atom, the single photons will be trapped in the both two-level
atoms. If we want the single photon continue to propagate, an-
other external control ﬁeld can be applied on the right atom.
Also, we hope more applications can be proposed based on
single photons propagating in one-demission waveguide cou-
pling to time-dependent two-level atom.
