Simultaneous Gaussian quadrature

for Angelesco systems

Abstract

We investigate simultaneous Gaussian quadrature for two integrals of the same
function f but on two disjoint intervals. The quadrature nodes are zeros of a type
II multiple orthogonal polynomial for an Angelesco system. We recall some known
results for the quadrature nodes and the quadrature weights and prove some new
results about the convergence of the quadrature formulas. Furthermore we give some
estimates of the quadrature weights. Our results are based on a vector equilibrium
problem in potential theory and weighted polynomial approximation.

Introduction

1.1 Simultaneous Gaussian quadrature
Suppose we are given r measures µ1, . . . , µr on the real line and a function f : R → R
and that we want to approximate the integrals

Z f (x) dµj(x),

1 ≤ j ≤ r

simultaneously with the same function f but with diﬀerent measures µ1, . . . , µr. Our goal
is to investigate interpolatory quadrature formulas so that

Z f (x) dµj(x) =

N

Xk=1

λ(j)
k,N f (xk,N )

holds for polynomials f of degree as large as possible, with one set of interpolation points
{xk,N , 1 ≤ k ≤ N} and r sets of quadrature weights {λ(j)
k,N , 1 ≤ k ≤ N}, with 1 ≤ j ≤ r.
This requires only N function evaluations, but rN quadrature weights. This notion of
simultaneous quadrature was introduced by Borges [11]. Later the relation with multiple
orthogonal polynomials was observed in [12], [13], [14], [19], [22, Chapter 4,§3.5]. However,
Angelesco already introduced simultaneous quadrature for several integrals in 1918 in [1]
for an Angelesco system, but apparently that paper was overlooked for a long time.

1.2 Multiple orthogonal polynomials
The type II multiple orthogonal polynomial P~n with multi-index ~n = (n1, . . . , nr) ∈ Nr
for the system of measures µ1, . . . , µr is deﬁned as the monic polynomial of degree |~n| =
n1 + · · · , nr for which

Z P~n(x)xk dµj(x) = 0,

0 ≤ k ≤ nj − 1,

(1.1)

for 1 ≤ j ≤ r. If this monic polynomial exists and is unique, then we call the multi-index
~n a normal index. If we choose the quadrature nodes as the zeros xk,~n of P~n, then the
corresponding interpolatory quadrature nodes are

λ(j)

k,~n =Z ℓk,~n dµj(x),

(1.2)

where ℓk,~n is the kth fundamental polynomial of Lagrange interpolation for the nodes
{xk,~n, 1 ≤ k ≤ |~n|}, and we have
Xj=1

k,~np(xk,~n) =Z p(x) dµj(x)

|~n|

λ(j)

whenever p is a polynomial of degree at most |~n| + nj − 1. Indeed, if p is a polynomial
of degree ≤ |~n| + nj − 1 and if L~n is the Lagrange interpolating polynomial for p at the
nodes {xk,~n, 1 ≤ k ≤ |~n|}, then

L~n(x) − p(x) = P~n(x)qnj −1(x),

where qnj −1 is a polynomial of degree at most nj − 1. Integrating then gives
Z L~n(x) dµj(x) −Z p(x) dµj(x) =Z P~n(x)qnj −1(x) dµj(x) = 0,

where the latter follows from (1.1). The result then follows since

Z L~n(x) dµj(x) =

|~n|

Xk=1

λ(j)
k,~np(xk,~n),

as is usual with interpolatory integration rules. If we require that the r quadrature rules
are correct for p, then the degree of p needs to be at most |~n|+min1≤j≤r nj−1. This degree
is maximal if all the nj are equal. Hence from now on we will use N = rn nodes which are
the zeros of the diagonal multiple orthogonal polynomial P(n,n,...,n), and the quadrature
formulas will be exact whenever p is a polynomial of degree at most (r + 1)n − 1. We
denote the zeros of the diagonal multiple orthogonal polynomial by {xk,rn, 1 ≤ k ≤ rn}
in increasing order

−∞ < x1,rn < x2,rn < · · · < xrn,rn < ∞,

and the corresponding quadrature weights by {λ(j)
quadrature rules becomes

k,rn, 1 ≤ k ≤ rn}, for 1 ≤ j ≤ r. So the

rn

Xk=1

λ(j)

k,rnp(xk,rn) =Z p(x) dµj(x),

2

p ∈ P(r+1)n−1,

(1.3)

where Pn is the set of all polynomials of degree at most n. Note that for r = 1 we obtain
the well known Gaussian quadrature rule for one integral.

Our goal is to investigate the following problems

• What can be said about the quadrature nodes xk,rn (location) and the quadrature
weights λ(j)
k,rn? In particular we want to know the sign of the quadrature weights. Re-
call that for Gaussian quadrature (r = 1) the quadrature weights are the Christoﬀel
numbers and they are always positive. This is essential for the convergence of the
quadrature rule.

• Under which conditions on f and on the measures (µ1, . . . , µr) will the quadrature

rules converge to the required integrals?

• What can be said of the size of the quadrature weights λ(j)

k,rn for 1 ≤ j ≤ r?

1.3 Angelesco systems

In this paper we will restrict our analysis to measures of an Angelesco system. Simul-
taneous quadrature formulas for a Nikishin system were investigated earlier by Fidalgo,
Ill´an and L´opez in [14].

An Angelesco system is a system of positive measures on the real line for which the
supports are on disjoint intervals: supp(µj) ⊂ [aj, bj] and (ai, bi) ∪ (aj, bj) = ∅ whenever
i 6= j. Observe that we allow the intervals to touch. We will sort the intervals from left
to right so that

−∞ < a1 < b1 ≤ a2 < b2 ≤ · · · ≤ ar < br < ∞.

Such systems were introduced by Angelesco in 1918–1919 [1, 2] and later also indepen-
dently by Nikishin [21]. An important result is that the type II multiple orthogonal
polynomial P~n for any multi-index ~n = (n1, . . . , nr) has nj simple zeros on (aj, bj) for
every j. Hence the multiple orthogonal polynomial can be factored as

P~n(x) =

p~n,j(x),

r

Yj=1

(1.4)

where each p~n,j is a polynomial of degree nj with all its zeros on (aj, bj). Each polynomial
p~n,j is in fact an ordinary orthogonal polynomial of degree nj on the interval [aj, bj] for

the measure Qi6=j |p~n,i(x)| dµj(x). Note that every p~n,i with i 6= j has constant sign on

[aj, bj].

1.4 Known results

The following result is already known, see [22, Chapter 4, Prop. 3.5], but we give a proof
because of its importance.

Theorem 1.1. The quadrature weights have the following property:

λ(j)
k,rn > 0,

when xk,rn ∈ [aj, bj],
k,rn has alternating sign when xk,rn ∈ [ai, bi] and i 6= j.

and λ(j)

(1.5)

Proof. Let ℓk,rn (1 ≤ k ≤ rn) be the fundamental polynomials of Lagrange interpolation
for the nodes {xi,rn, 1 ≤ i ≤ rn}, for which

ℓk,rn(xi,rn) = δi,k,

and let ℓ(j)
k,n be the fundamental polynomial of Lagrange interpolation for the zeros of p~n,j
which we deﬁned in (1.4), i.e., for the nodes {xi,rn, (j − 1)n + 1 ≤ i ≤ jn}. If we take the
polynomial p(x) = ℓk,rn(x)ℓ(j)

k,n of degree (r + 1)n − 2, then the quadrature (1.3) gives
k,rn =Z bj

k,n(x) dµ(x)

ℓk,rn(x)ℓ(j)

λ(j)

aj

for (j − 1)n + 1 ≤ k ≤ jn, i.e., for the quadrature weights corresponding to the nodes
xk,rn ∈ [aj, bj]. The fundamental polynomials of Lagrange interpolation are given by

ℓk,rn(x) =

P~n(x)
(x − xk,rn)P ′

~n(xk,rn)

,

ℓ(j)
k,n(x) =

p~n,j(x)
(x − xk,rn)p′

~n,j(xk,rn)

,

and P ′

~n(xk,rn) = p′

~n,j(xk,rn)Qi6=j p~n,i(xk,rn), hence
k,rn =Z bj
aj Yi6=j

p~n,i(xk,rn) 

p~n,i(x)

λ(j)

p~n,j(x)
(x − xk,rn)p′

~n,j(xk,rn)!2

dµj(x).

The integral is positive since p~n,i(x) has the same sign as p~n,i(xk,rn) on [aj, bj]. This proves
(1.5).

Suppose next that xk,rn ∈ [ai, bi] with i 6= j. Then we take the polynomial p(x) =

ℓk,rn(x)p~n,j(x) of degree (r + 1)n − 1 in the quadrature formula (1.3) to ﬁnd

ℓk,rn(x)p~n,j(x) dµj(x).

λ(j)

k,rnp~n,j(xk,rn) =Z bj
~n,i(xk,rn)Qm6=i p~n,m(xk,rn), so that

aj

p~n,m(x)

p~n,m(xk,rn)

p~n,i(x)
(x − xk,rn)p′

~n,i(xk,rn)(cid:18) p~n,j(x)

p~n,j(xk,rn)(cid:19)2

dµj(x).

Now we have P ′

~n(xk,rn) = p′

λ(j)

k,rn =Z bj

aj Ym6=i,j

Each factor in the integrand has constant sign on [aj, bj], independent of k, except for
p′
~n,i(xk,rn) which has alternating sign when xk,rn runs through the interval [ai, bi].

A careful analysis of the sign of λ(j)

The positive quadrature weights {λ(j)

and this is the Gaussian quadrature formula for the (varying) weight Qi6=j p~n,i(x) dµj(x).

Hence

λ(j)

(j−1)n+kYi6=j

p~n,i(x(j−1)n+k,rn) = λk,n Yi6=j

p~n,i dµj! ,

(1.6)

where λk,n(µ) are the Christoﬀel numbers for a measure µ, i.e.,

λk,n(µ) = λn(ξk; µ),

λn(x; µ) =

1
j=0 p2
j (x; µ)

,

Pn−1

where λn(x; µ) is the Christoﬀel function and pn(x; µ) are the orthonormal polynomials
for a positive measure µ on the real line, with {ξk, 1 ≤ k ≤ n} the zeros of pn(x; µ).

2 Simultaneous Gaussian quadrature on two inter-

vals

From now on we deal with the case r = 2 with two intervals [a1, b1] and [a2, b2] (with
b1 ≤ a2) and write P~n(x) = Pn,n(x) = (−1)npn(x)qn(x), where pn has n zeros on [a1, b1]
and qn has n zeros on [a2, b2]:

pn(x) =

n

Yj=1
(x − xj,2n),

qn(x) = (−1)n

2n

(x − xj,2n),

Yj=n+1

where the (−1)n in the deﬁnition of qn is to ensure that qn > 0 on [a1, b1]. Recall our
ordering of the zeros

a1 < x1,2n < x2,2n < · · · < xn,rn < b1 ≤ a2 < xn+1,2n < · · · x2n,2n < b2.

The quadratures are

(2.3)

For the alternating quadrature weights, it follows from (2.1) with p(x) = q(x)p2

(2.5)

for every q ∈ Pn−1. This is the interpolatory quadrature rule for integrals on [a1, b1] with
(positive) weight p2
n dµ1 and quadrature nodes on [a2, b2]. This is a very strange quadrature
rule and one does not expect good behavior since [a1, b1] and [a2, b2] are disjoint. In a
similar way one also ﬁnds from (2.2) that

n

n(xk,2n) =Z b2
holds for every q ∈ Pn−1. From Theorem 1.1 we have

2.1 Poss´e-Chebyshev-Markov-Stieltjes inequalities

First we recall the classical Poss´e-Chebyshev-Markov-Stieltjes inequalities. Let µ be a
positive measure on the real line with all ﬁnite power moments

Fix n ≥ 1 and let

j = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

Z xj dµ(x),
−∞ < ξ1 < ξ2 < · · · < ξn < ∞

denote the zeros of the nth orthogonal polynomial for µ. Let 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n and f : (−∞, ξℓ] →
[0,∞) be a function with 2n continuous derivatives satisfying

f (k)(x) ≥ 0,

0 ≤ k ≤ 2n, x ∈ (−∞, ξℓ).

(2.7)

Then [15, Eq. (5.10) on p. 33]

λn(x; µ) =

k=0 p2
k(x; µ)

,

Pn−1

where {pk(x; µ)} are the orthonormal polynomials for µ, and {λn(ξk), 1 ≤ k ≤ n} are the
Christoﬀel numbers or Gaussian quadrature weights for the quadrature with nodes at the
zeros of pn(x; µ). If, in addition, (2.7) holds on the whole real line (in fact, it is suﬃcient
to hold on the smallest interval that contains the support of µ) then [15, Lemma III.1.5
on p. 92]

n

Xk=1

λn(ξk; µ)f (ξk) ≤Z ∞

(2.9)

Here is an analogue for the positive weights on the ﬁrst interval [a1, b1]. A similar result
also holds for the positive weights on the second interval.

Theorem 2.1. Let n ≥ 1, 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n, and g : (−∞, xℓ,2n] → [0,∞) have 2n continuous

(2.12)

If we let dµ = qn dµ1 then we see that (2.12) is the Gaussian quadrature for the measure
µ and {xk,2n, 1 ≤ k ≤ n} are the zeros of the nth orthogonal polynomial for µ. Moreover
(2.3) holds for the quadrature weights. Let g satisfy (2.10), and deﬁne f = g/qn, then

so (2.11) follows from the classical Poss´e-Chebyshev-Markov-Stieltjes inequalities (2.8) if
we can show that f satisﬁes (2.7). By Leibniz’ rule

f (k)(x) =

In view of (2.10), it suﬃces to show that for all j ≥ 0 and x ≤ b1

qn(x) ≥ 0.
This is easily established by induction on j. Indeed,

qn dµ1.

2.2 Potential theory

1 > 0 almost everywhere on [a1, b1] and µ′

Suppose that µ′
2 > 0 almost everywhere on
[a2, b2]. The asymptotic distribution of the quadrature nodes xj,2n is given by two prob-
ability measures ν1 and ν2 which satisfy a vector equilibrium problem in logarithmic
potential theory, where supp(ν1) ⊂ [a1, b1] and supp(ν2) ⊂ [a2, b2]. They minimize the
logarithmic energy

I(ν1, ν1) + I(ν2, ν2) + I(ν1, ν2),

over all probability measures ν1 with support on [a1, b1] and ν2 with support on [a2, b2]
(see, e.g., [22, Chapter 5, §6]). Here the (mutual) logarithmic energy is given by

I(νi, νj) =Z bi

ai Z bj

aj

log

1

|x − y|

dνj(x) dνi(y),

1 ≤ i, j ≤ 2,

The minimization actually describes an interaction between the measures ν1 and ν2 where
the charge of ν1 on [a1, b1] repels the charge ν2 on [a2, b2] and vice versa. The variational
conditions for the potentials

are

and

U(x; ν1) =Z log

U(x; ν1) + 2U(x; ν2) (= ℓ2, x ∈ [a∗, b2],
> ℓ2, x ∈ [a2, a∗),

dν2(y),

(2.17)

(2.18)

where ℓ1 and ℓ2 are constants (Lagrange multipliers). In fact ℓ1 and ν1 determine the nth
root asymptotic of the orthonormal polynomials on [a1, b1] with orthogonality measure
qn dµ1 and ℓ2 and ν2 determine the nth root asymptotic behavior of the orthonormal poly-
nomials on [a2, b2] with orthogonality measure pn dµ2. The monic orthogonal polynomial
of degree n for the weight qn dµ1 on [a1, b1] is equal to the polynomial pn and the monic
orthogonal polynomial of degree n for the weight pn dµ2 on [a2, b2] is (−1)nqn. Their norms

γn(pn dµ2)1/n = eℓ2/2.

(2.19)

The asymptotic distribution of the zeros of pn is given by ν1 and the asymptotic dis-
tribution of the zeros of qn by ν2, i.e., for every continuous function f on [a1, b1] one
has

(see [22, Chapter 5, §6]).

2.3 Mhaskar-Rakhmanov-Saﬀ numbers
The support of the measures ν1 can be a subset [a1, b∗] of [a1, b1] (i.e., b∗ ≤ b1) and the
support of ν2 can be a subset [a∗, b2] of [a2, b2] (i.e., a∗ ≥ a2). In fact only three things
are possible [22, Chapter 5, §6.5]:

• b∗ = b1 and a∗ = a2, in which case the measures ν1 and ν2 are supported on the full
intervals [a1, b1] and [a2, b2]. This typically happens when the two intervals are of
the same size or the distance between the intervals is big.

• b∗ = b1 and a∗ > a2, in which case ν1 has support on the full interval [a1, b1] but ν2
on a smaller interval. This typically happens when the intervals are close together
and b1 − a1 < b2 − a2. The charge on the smaller interval [a1, b1] pushes the charge
on the larger interval [a2, b2] to the right. This has the eﬀect that there will be no
zeros of qn on the interval [a2, a∗].

• b∗ < b1 and a∗ = a2, in which case ν2 is supported on the full interval [a2, b2] but
ν1 is supported on a smaller interval. This typically happens when the intervals are
close together and b2 − a2 < b1 − a1. The eﬀect is similar to the previous case but
the role of the two intervals is interchanged.

The numbers a1 and b∗ are the Mhaskar-Rakhmanov-Saﬀ numbers for the equilibrium
distribution ν1 on [a1, b1] with external ﬁeld Qn = − 1
n log qn as n → ∞, and the numbers
a∗ and b2 are the MRS numbers for the equilibrium distribution ν2 on [a2, b2] with external
ﬁeld Pn = − 1
Theorem 2.3. For n ≥ 1 the support of the extremal measure for the external ﬁeld Qn
is [a1, b∗

n log pn as n → ∞.

n is the unique root in (a1, b1] of

n], where b∗

x ∈ [a1, b1].
We will use [23, Thm. IV.1.11 on p. 201], and observe that

and yj,2n = 1/xj,2n. We will prove similar results in a more general setting.

The following simple bounds for the quadrature weights {λ(1)

quadrature nodes on the ﬁrst interval [a1, b1] are given by:

j,2n, 1 ≤ j ≤ n} for the

Proposition 2.4.

(a) For 1 ≤ j ≤ n one has

(2.26)

λ(1)
j,2n ≥ λm(xj,2n; µ1),

where m = ⌈ 3n
for the measure µ1 on [a1, b1].

(b) If J1 is a closed subinterval of (a1, b1) and µ1 is absolutely continuous in an open
1 is bounded from below by a positive constant there, then

(see [15, Thm. III.3.3 on p. 104]). Then the result follows from (a).

Next, we present an asymptotic upper bound under the assumption that − 1

n log qn is
an external ﬁeld with appropriate asymptotic behavior. We will use Totik’s Theorem 8.3
[25, p. 52] on weighted polynomial approximation. For the sake of completeness, Totik’s
theorem is the following

Theorem 2.5 (Totik). Suppose that (wn)n are weights, wn = exp(−Qn), and that the
support of the equilibrium measure Swn = supp(µwn) is [0, 1] for all n. Furthermore assume
that on every closed subinterval [a, b] ⊂ (0, 1) the functions wn are uniformly of class C 1+ǫ
for some ǫ > 0 that may depend on [a, b], and the functions tQ′
n(t) are nondecreasing on
(0, 1) and there are points 0 < c < d < 1 and η > 0 such that dQ′
n(c) + η
for all n. Then every continuous function that vanishes outside (0, 1) can be uniformly
approximated on [0, 1] by weighted polynomials wn

n(d) ≥ cQ′

nPn, where deg Pn ≤ n.

By means of this theorem we can obtain the following result.

12

Proposition 2.6.

(a) Suppose b1 < a2 and choose r ∈ (b1, a2). For n ≥ 1 deﬁne wn on [a1, r] by

(b) If in addition, we assume that J1 is a closed subinterval of (a1, b∗) and µ1 is absolutely
1 is bounded above by a positive

continuous in an open neighborhood of J1 while µ′
constant there, then for some C2 > 0, independent of j and n, we have

Thus {Q′′

onto [a1, b∗

n} are uniformly bounded in [a1, b1]. Our hypothesis is that the external ﬁeld Qn
n → b∗ as n → ∞. Let Ln(t) denote the linear map of [0, 1]
n] for n ≥ 1. Then the external ﬁeld Qn◦ Ln has support [0, 1]. This follows, for

n] where b∗

13

example, from [23, Thm. I.3.3, p. 44]. Moreover, as n → ∞, Ln converges to the linear
map of [0, 1] onto [a1, b∗].
Next let ε > 0 be a small positive number and f = 1 in [ε, 1 − ε], while f is a linear
function on [0, ε] with value 0 at 0 and 1 at ε. Similarly, let f be a linear function on
[1−ε, 1] with value 1 at 1−ε and 0 at 1. By Totik’s theorem, applied to the external ﬁelds
{Qn ◦ Ln}, there exist polynomials Rn of degree ≤ n such that uniformly for x ∈ [0, 1],

lim
n→∞

Rn(x)qn(cid:0)Ln(x)(cid:1) = f (x).

Note too, that if 1 < r < limn→∞ Ln(a2), then for large enough n, qn(cid:0)Ln(x)(cid:1) is deﬁned

on [a1, r] and is convex, so uniformly in this interval,

(cid:12)(cid:12)Rn(x)qn(cid:0)Ln(x)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ sup

[0,1]

f + o(1) = 1 + o(1).

Here we are using the majorization principle in Theorem II.2.1 in [23, p. 153] and the fact
that the weight on this extended interval has the same extremal support. Now let

where L[−1]

n(y) = Rn(cid:0)L[−1]

Given a compact subset J1 of (a1, b∗), we may assume that ε above is so small that
uniformly for y ∈ J1, we have (2.30). Then for xj,2n ∈ J1,

We can now deduce some results for the spacing of zeros:

Proof. These follow from Corollary 2.2 and Propositions 2.4 and 2.6.

3 Convergence results

3.1 The positive weights
Since the simultaneous quadrature rules (2.1)–(2.2) are correct for polynomials of degree ≤
3n−1, one would expect that the quadrature rules also converge, for n → ∞ for functions
f that can be approximated well by polynomials. However, this is not true, and this is
mainly due to the fact that not all the quadrature weights are positive. However, it is true
that if you restrict the quadrature sum to quadrature nodes on the appropriate interval,
which is [a1, b1] for the ﬁrst quadrature (2.1), then one has convergence whenever f can
be approximated by weighted polynomials, and the weight is in terms of the polynomial
containing the zeros on the other interval, which is [a2, b2] for the ﬁrst quadrature rule.
Again, we can use Totik’s theorem (Theorem 2.5) on weighted polynomial approximation
[24, Thm. 8.3]. If we use the weights wn(x) = qn(x) on [a1, b1], then the support of the
equilibrium measure µwn is a subset [a1, b∗
n → b∗, as we have seen in
Section 2.3. Totik’s theorem tells us that we can approximate every continuous function
f that vanishes outside (a1, b∗) uniformly on [a1, b∗] by weighted polynomials qnRn, i.e.,
there exist polynomials Rn of degree ≤ n such that

n] ⊂ [a1, b1], where b∗

n→∞kf − RnqnkL∞([a1,b∗]) = 0.
lim

(3.1)

This allows to prove the following result.

Theorem 3.1. Let f be a continuous function on [a1, b1] and f (b∗) = 0, where [a1, b∗] ⊂
[a1, b1] is the support of the ﬁrst measure ν1 of the vector equilibrium problem for the
Angelesco system. Then

Observe that we restrict the quadrature rule and only the nodes on [a1, b1] are used.

Proof. Introduce the function f ∗ as the restriction of f to [a1, b∗] and zero elsewhere, then
Totik’s theorem applied to f ∗ gives a sequence of polynomials (Rn)n of degree ≤ n, such
that

n→∞kf − RnqnkL∞([a1,b∗]) → 0.

j,2n remains bounded (see (2.16) in Corollary 2.2), hence the result will
be proved if we can show that R b1
b∗ |Rn(x)| |qn(x)| dµ1(x) tends to zero. But this follows
because f ∗ = 0 on [b∗, b1] and Rnqn converges to f ∗ uniformly on [a1, b1], hence Rnqn → 0
uniformly on [b∗, b1] (see the remark in [24, p. 49] between Theorem 8.1 and its proof).

Remark: The restriction f (b∗) = 0 can be removed if we assume that the measure µ1
has no mass at b∗.

16

p2
n dµ1(x). Observe that the interpolation nodes are on [a2, b2] whereas the integral is over
[a1, b1]. The ℓ(2)

j,n are the fundamental polynomials of Lagrange interpolation

j,n(x) =

(2.18) gives U(x; ν1) − ℓ2 ≥ −2U(x; ν2), hence combining (3.7) and (3.8) gives
xn+j,2n → x ∈ [a∗, b2].

n(xn+j,2n)|1/n = exp[−U(x; ν2)],

n→∞|q′
lim

Combining this with (3.6) gives the required result. Note that xn+j,2n can only converge
to points in [a∗, b2], which is why we chose to take x ∈ [a∗, b2].

This theorem implies that the size of the absolute value of the coeﬃcients λ(1)

n+j,2n

is determined by the size of 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ1 on [a∗, b2], which is the interval
where the zeros xn+j,2n accumulate. Note that the variational condition (2.17) shows that
2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ1 = 0 on [a1, b∗], but we need to know the size of this quantity on
the other interval [a∗, b2].
The function 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ1 is a continuous function on (−∞, a1) and on
(b2, +∞), which is increasing on (−∞, a1) and decreasing on (b2, +∞). On [a1, b∗] we
know that it is 0 (hence constant) and on [a∗, b2] the variational condition (2.18) gives
2U(x; ν2) = ℓ2 − U(x; ν1) so that

2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ1 =

U(x; ν1) − ℓ1 +

,

x ∈ [a∗, b2],

and U(x; ν1) is decreasing on (b1, +∞), which implies that 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ1 is
decreasing on [a∗, b2]. This means that 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ1 is maximal on [a∗, b2]
at the initial point a∗, meaning that |λ(1)
n+j,2n| will be maximal for small j and it will
grow exponentially when 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ1 > 0, or decrease exponentially when
2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ1 < 0 there.
In the gap (b∗, a∗) we have that 2U(x; ν1) is decreasing and U(x; ν2) is increasing, so
the behavior of 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2)− ℓ1 is not immediately clear. However, if b∗ < b1 then
2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2)− ℓ1 > 0 on (b∗, b1] so that 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2)− ℓ1 is increasing near
b∗. In that case a∗ = a2 and we know already that 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ1 is decreasing
on [a2, b2]. Whether or not the initial |λ(1)
n+j,2n| are exponentially increasing or decreasing
thus follows by a careful investigation of the function 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ1. We will
give a few examples of what happens in actual cases.
Example 1. Two disjoint intervals [a1, b1] and [a2, b2] of equal size. In this case the
measure ν1 is supported on [a1, b1] and ν2 is supported on [a2, b2]. This corresponds to case
I in [5]. In Figure 1 we have plotted 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) where we have taken [a1, b1] =

[−p5 + 4√2,−1] and [a2, b2] = [1,p5 + 4√2]. The function Φ(x) = exp −U(x), where

U is the logarithmic potential of ν1 or ν2, satisﬁes the third order algebraic equation

where one needs to choose the correct branch for ν1 or ν2 (see [5, Thm. 2.10] for more
details). Observe that 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) is constant on the left interval and strictly less
than that constant on the right interval. This means that the quadrature weights λ(1)
for 1 ≤ j ≤ n are exponentially small.

Example 2. Two disjoint intervals [a1, b1] and [a2, b2] but |b1 − a1| > |b2 − a2|. In
this case the zeros on the smaller interval [a2, b2] push the zeros on the larger interval
[a1, b2] to the left, and b∗ < b1. This corresponds to case III in [5]. In Figure 2 we have
plotted 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) for the case [a1, b1] = [−1, 0] and [a2, b2] = [0, 1/4], in which
case b∗ = −1/28 (see [18, §6] where b∗ = −za with a = −1/4, or [5, Eq. (1.25)]). The
function Φ(x) = exp[−U(x)] now satisﬁes the algebraic equation (3.9) with

where again one needs to choose the correct branch for ν1 or ν2 (see [5, Thm. 2.18] for
more details). Observe that 2U(x; ν1)+U(x; ν2) is a constant ℓ1 on [−1,−1/28] but bigger
than that constant on ] − 1/28, 0] and then decreases, so that at the beginning of [0, 1/4]
the value is greater than ℓ1 and in the second part of the interval it is less than ℓ1. This
means that the ﬁrst quadrature weights (−1)j+1λ(1)
n+j,2n are exponentially large, but later
on they become exponentially small.

3.3 Convergence for analytic functions

What kind of conditions on f does one need in order that both quadrature rules converge?
We need to distinguish three cases (see Section 2.3):

case I: the supports of the equilibrium measures ν1, ν2 are the full intervals: supp(ν1) =

[a1, b1] and supp(ν2) = [a2, b2].

case II: The support of ν1 is a subinterval: supp(ν1) = [a1, b∗], with b∗ < b1. For ν2 one

then has supp(ν2) = [a2, b2].

21

case III: The support of ν2 is a subinterval: supp(ν2) = [a∗, b2], with a2 < a∗, and in

that case supp(ν1) = [a1, b1].

For case I it is suﬃcient that f is a continuous function on both intervals whenever

the intervals are not touching.

Theorem 3.3. Suppose both interval [a1, b1] and [a2, b2] are of the same size so that
supp(ν1) = [a1, b1] and supp(ν2) = [a2, b2] and let a2 − b1 > 0. If f is continuous on
[a1, b1] and [a2, b2], then both quadrature rules converge.

Proof. From Theorem 2.3 we already have (note that b∗ = b1 and a∗ = a2)

lim
n→∞

n

2n

and

lim
n→∞

Xj=n+1

hence we only need to prove that

Xj=1

λ(2)
j,2nf (xj,2n) = 0.

Note that f is bounded on [a1, b1] and on [a2, b2]. The result then follows because Theorem
3.2 implies that these quadrature weights are exponentially decreasing to 0. We will
show this for the weights λ(1)
n+j,2n and the reasoning is similar for the other weights. The
symmetry implies that ℓ1 = ℓ2 = ℓ, and if we assume (without loss of generality) that
[a1, b1] = [−b2,−a2], then U(x, ν1) = U(−x; ν2) for x ∈ R. On [a2, b2] we have

2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) = [U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2)] + U(x; ν1) = ℓ − U(x; ν2) + U(x; ν1),

where we used the variational condition (2.18) to get U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) = ℓ − U(x; ν2)
on [a2, b2]. We claim that

U(x; ν1) − U(x; ν2) ≤ U(a2; ν1) − U(a2; ν2) =: c < 0,

(3.10)

which gives 2U(x; ν1) + U(x; ν2) − ℓ ≤ c < 0 on [a2, b2], from which the exponential
decrease follows. To show (3.10) we observe that U(x; ν1) is a strictly decreasing function
on [b1,∞) so that U(a2; ν1) < U(b1; ν1) = U(a2; ν2), where we used the symmetry, hence
c < 0. On [a2, b2] we have that U(x; ν2) = [ℓ− U(x; ν1)]/2 so that U(x; ν2) is an increasing
function on [a2, b2], and hence U(x; ν1)− U(x; ν2) attains its maximum at the initial point
a2, giving (3.10).

Remark: When the integrals are touching (b1 = a2) one still has 2U(x; ν1)+U(x; ν2)−ℓ ≤
0 on [a2, b2], hence the quadrature weights λ(1)
n+j,2n for the nodes in [a2 + ǫ, b2] will be
exponentially descreasing for every ǫ > 0, but we cannot control the quadrature weights
near a2.

For cases II–III a much stronger condition on f is required. The correct region of

If we use Fubini’s theorem to change the order of integration, and Cauchy’s theorem for

This convergence region has been investigated in detail in [17] and [3], and depends on
some geometric analysis on a Riemann surface of genus 0 for a cubic algebraic function.
We will explain the standard arguments to arrive at a description of this convergence
region. See [16] and [22, Chapter 5, §6.4] for more details. From (3.12) we ﬁnd that

with γ < 0, in which case the quadrature rules converge at an exponential rate.

4 Conclusion and future directions

We showed that simultaneous quadrature for an Angelesco system with two measures may
not always converge to the required integrals. In particular Theorem 3.1 shows that one
cannot approximate the integral of a function that is positive on [b∗, b1] and zero elsewhere

25

in the case when b∗ < b1. The quadrature rules do converge to the correct integrals if the
two intervals are of the same size or if the function f is analytic in a big enough region, so
that function values in the gap [b∗, b1] or [a2, a∗] can be recovered from information on the
interval [a2, b2] or [a1, b1] respectively. The main disadvantage is that quadrature weights
are changing sign and they may grow exponentially fast. The main advantage is that one
needs to evaluate the function for both quadrature rules at the same 2n points and the
degree of accuracy is 3n− 1, which is higher than what one would get if one uses Gaussian
quadrature with n nodes in every interval, which also uses 2n function evaluations but
which has degree of accuracy 2n − 1. Angelesco systems may not be the most useful
systems for simultaneous quadrature, but other systems (AT systems, Nikishin systems)
are more promising and are also of more interest for practical applications.

Of course there are many problems left over for future work. First of all we restricted
our analysis to two disjoint intervals, but surely much of our results can be extended
to several disjoint intervals. The equilibrium problem will be more complicated and in
particular ﬁnding the support of the measures for the vector equilibrium problem (the
Mhaskar-Rakhmanov-Saﬀ numbers) will be more involved. Another problem is to ﬁnd
the distribution of the nodes xk,rn whenever the quadrature rules converge, hence not
only for the Gaussian quadrature rules, but also when the rule has degree of exactness
less than (r + 1)n − 1. In particular one would like to ﬁnd an analogue of the results
of Bloom, Lubinsky and Stahl [9, 10], and one would expect that the limiting distribu-
tion of the quadrature nodes is a convex combination of the limiting distribution of the
zeros of the type II multiple orthogonal polynomial P(n,n,...,n) and a positive measure sup-
ported on the intervals.
In this paper we restricted our analysis to Angelesco systems
(measures supported on disjoint intervals). Earlier, Fidalgo Prieto, Ill´an and L´opez Lago-
masino investigated simultaneous Gaussian quadrature for Nikishin systems. Many other
systems of measures can be investigated, in particular systems of overlapping intervals,
algebraic Chebyshev systems (AT-systems), and special multiple orthogonal polynomials
for which explicit formulas are known.
In particular it would be of practical impor-
tance to investigate simultaneous Gaussian quadrature for r exponential weights of the
form wj(x) = e−x2+cjx, with ci 6= cj whenever i 6= j. These weights correspond to normal
densities with means at cj/2 (1 ≤ j ≤ r), which can be used to ﬁlter a signal f for frequen-
cies near cj/2. The corresponding multiple orthogonal polynomials are multiple Hermite
polynomials, and these have been investigated extensively in random matrix theory, e.g.,
[6, 4, 8, 7]. Finally, it is important to have eﬃcient numerical techniques to generate the
Gaussian quadrature formulas, in particular to compute the quadrature nodes (i.e., the
zeros of type II multiple orthogonal polynomials) and the quadrature weights. Some work
in this direction has already been initiated by Milovanovi´c and Stani´c [19].

j,2n (1 ≤ j ≤ n) and λ(2)

There may be an alternative way to obtain useful information of the positive quadra-
ture weights λ(1)
j+n,2n (1 ≤ j ≤ n) if one can extend some of Totik’s
results in [24] on Christoﬀel functions for varying weights. In [20, §6, Thm. 6 on p. 78]
it is shown that if µ is a positive measure on [a, b] for which µ′ > 0 almost everywhere on
[a, b] and g > 0 is a continuous function on (a, b), then one has the following asymptotic
result for the Christoﬀel functions for g dµ and dµ:

lim
n→∞

λn(x; g dµ)
λn(x; dµ)

= g(x),

26

uniformly on [a + ǫ, b − ǫ]. A similar result for the varying weight qn dµ1 of the form

lim
n→∞

λn(x; qn dµ1)

qn(x)λn(x; dµ1)

= 1,

uniformly on [a1, b1] (or on [a1 + ǫ, b1 − ǫ]), together with the relation (2.3), would give

λ(1)
k,2n

λn(xk,2n; dµ1)

lim
n→∞

for any sequence of zeros for which xk,2 → x ∈ [a1, b1] (or [a1 + ǫ, b1 − ǫ]).
