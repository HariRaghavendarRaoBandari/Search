The phase diagram of dense QCD at nonvanishing temperatures and large quark chemical po-
tentials is studied with Dyson-Schwinger equations for 2 + 1 quark ﬂavors, focusing on color-
superconducting phases with 2SC and CFL-like pairing. The truncation scheme of our previous
investigations [1] is extended to include the dressing of gluons with selfconsistently determined
quarks, i.e., taking into account the dynamical masses and superconducting gaps of the quarks in
the gluon polarization. As a consequence the gluon screening is reduced, leading to an enhancement
of the critical temperatures of the color-superconducting phases by about a factor of 2 as compared
to the case where the gluons are dressed with bare quarks. We also calculate the Debye and Meissner
masses of the gluons and show that they are consistent with weak-coupling results.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The phase structure of QCD at high but not asymptot-
ically high baryon densities remains an unresolved prob-
lem. While in recent years, thanks to substantial eﬀort in
lattice gauge theory, consensus has been reached about
the equation of state at ﬁnite temperature but vanish-
ing chemical potential [2, 3], the application of these
techniques to large chemical potentials is inhibited by
the fermion sign problem.
In this context functional
methods, such as the Functional Renormalization Group
(FRG) [4–7] or Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) [1, 8–
16], have become important alternative tools. They suc-
cessfully reproduce the lattice-QCD results at zero den-
sity but in addition also provide access to the ﬁnite-
density regime.

Using DSEs, various studies of the QCD phase dia-
gram at nonzero temperature and densities have been
performed, mostly focusing on low and moderate chem-
ical potentials. These studies conﬁrm the lattice-result
of a crossover at low densities and predict a ﬁrst-order
transition at higher densities1 with a critical endpoint at
quark chemical potentials typically around µ = 150 −
200 MeV [9–12].
Some time ago, DSEs have also been applied to QCD at
zero temperature and higher chemical potential to study
color superconductivity,
i.e., the formation of quark
Cooper pairs [14–16]. Both, the two-ﬂavor superconduct-
ing (2SC) and the color-ﬂavor locked (CFL) pairing pat-
terns have been investigated.
In our previous work [1]
we extended the analysis to nonvanishing temperature,
considering 2 + 1 ﬂavors with massless up- and down
quarks and a realistic strange quark mass. We found
that the CFL phase is favored at low temperature and
chemical potentials larger than 500 − 600 MeV, while at
lower chemical potentials there is a 2SC phase, which

1 Allowing for non-uniform structures, there can also be an inho-

mogeneous phase in this regime [13].

also extends to higher chemical potentials in a narrow
temperature band above the CFL phase. The critical
temperatures to the normal conducting phase are of the
order of 20 − 30 MeV.

However, these results should not be considered as
ﬁnal. Although,
in principle, DSEs provide an exact
approach to QCD, they form an inﬁnite set of integro-
diﬀerential equations, which needs to be truncated in or-
der to be solved in practice. In Ref. [1] a truncation was
employed where the quark loop of the gluon polarization
function was evaluated in hard-thermal-loop-hard-dense-
loop (HTL-HDL) approximation. This implies that the
vacuum parts of the quark loops were neglected while the
medium contrubutions were evaluated with bare quarks
instead of dressed ones. This has the advantage that the
quark loop can be calculated analytically, keeping the
numerical eﬀort similar to a quenched calculation where
quark eﬀects on the gluon propagator are neglected com-
pletely.

On the other hand, while this approximation is reason-
able in the high-temperature regime, where the supercon-
ducting gap vanishes and the dynamical quark masses are
small, it becomes obviously questionable in color super-
conducting phases or phases with broken chiral symme-
try, including the vacuum. Indeed it was found in Ref. [9]
that including the dynamical quark mass in the gluon
polarization leads to a sizeable shift of the chiral critical
endpoint relative to the HTL-HDL result [8]. Moreover,
in Ref. [1] we were not able to match vacuum and in-
medium observables simultaneously: Adjusting the pa-
rameters to reproduce the lattice value of the chiral crit-
ical temperature, the value of the pion decay constant fπ
in vacuum was overestimated by 40%, while a ﬁt to fπ
yields a critical temperature below 100 MeV.

Here we therefore want to present an improved ver-
sion of our analysis in Ref. [1], using a truncation where
the gluon polarization is calculated selfconsistently with
dressed quarks. While for the critical endpoint and the
crossover region at low chemical potentials the eﬀects of
this selfconsistent treatment have already been studied in

Ref. [9], the novel aspect of the present work is the exten-
sion to color superconducting phases, in particular taking
into account the anomalous selfenergy of the quark prop-
agator. As an additional result, we also obtain the Debye
and Meissner masses of the gluons. Evaluating them in
the weak-coupling limit, they provide an additional con-
sistency check for our truncation scheme, in particular
for the quark-gluon vertex.

ing special care about a proper renormalization of the

Debye and Meissner masses of the gluons, both, in the
weak-coupling limit and at strong coupling. Finally, in
Section VII, we draw conclusions.

II. DYSON-SCHWINGER FORMALISM FOR

COLOR-SUPERCONDUCTING PHASES

In this section we brieﬂy summarize the Dyson-
Schwinger formalism of our previous work on color su-
perconducting matter [1]. We restrict ourselves to those
aspects which are relevant for our present studies and
refer to that reference for further technical details.

FIG. 1. DSE of the quark propagator. Plain and curly lines
represent quark and gluon propagators, respectively, while
thick dots represent dressed quantities.

We work in Landau gauge and solve the Dyson-
Schwinger equation for the dressed quark propagator,
depicted in Fig. 1 in imaginary time. At temperature
T and chemical potential µ the equation is given by

function renormalization constant. As we study color
superconductivity, the bare and dressed quark propaga-
tors S0 and S as well as the quark self-energy Σ are 2× 2
matrices in Nambu-Gorkov (NG) space

addition, each component has a Dirac, color and ﬂavor
substructure, where we consider Nc = 3 colors and 2 + 1
ﬂavors, unless noted otherwise. The color-ﬂavor struc-

the quark loop is added perturbatively to the equation,
without modifying the Yang-Mills propagator. This has
the advantage that the Yang-Mills diagrams do not need
to be calculated explicitly and we can use lattice data.

III. TRUNCATION

The quark DSE, Eq. (1), is an exact equation and can
be solved once the dressed gluon propagator and quark-
gluon vertex are known. These are given as solutions
of their own DSEs, depending on higher n-point func-
tions. Therefore truncations are necessary in order to
get a closed set of equations. In this section, we describe
our improved truncation scheme, extending our previous
work [1].

A. Truncation of the gluon propagator

The DSE for the dressed gluon propagator consists of a
pure Yang-Mills part and a quark-loop diagram, as shown

and the Yang-Mills dressing functions Z Y M
T T,T L(k), ob-
tained from ﬁts to lattice data [19]. Quark eﬀects on the
gluon are taken into account in the gluon polarization

where p = k + q.

This truncation is self-consistent on the level of quarks,
as the polarization loop depends on dressed quark prop-
agators. In our previous study [1], we dropped the self-
consistency at this point and evaluated the quark loop
in a hard-thermal-loop–hard-dense-loop approximation
(HTL-HDL) with bare quark propagators. The use of
bare quark propagators in the gluon DSE makes it in-
dependent of the dressed quark propagator and the nu-
merical eﬀort is similar to a pure rainbow truncation.
On the other hand, it neglects important contributions
to the gluon polarization, such as those of quark masses
and color-superconducting condensates. This can be tol-
erated in the chirally restored phase at high tempera-
tures, where these contributions are small, but becomes
questionable in the chirally broken phase and in the color-
superconducting regime. Here, we therefore calculate the
quark loop in the polarization function Eq. (17) with self-
consistent fully dressed Nambu-Gor’kov quark propaga-
tors.

Although the full gluon propagator must be transverse,
ensured by Slavnov-Taylor identities in full QCD, the po-
larization loop, Eq. (17), may have longitudinal contribu-
tions. In the full gluon DSE these would be canceled by
longitudinal contributions of Yang-Mills diagrams. How-
ever, as we do not calculate the quark back-coupling to

the Yang-Mills system, we do not get this cancellation.
Therefore we drop the longitudinal part of the polariza-
tion loop by hand.

Another technical complication arises from the fact
that for the numerical evaluation of the polarization loop
we have to introduce a momentum cut-oﬀ. This gener-
ates artiﬁcial quadratic divergencies ∼ Λ2, which have
to be regularized. These divergencies do not occur in
dimensional regularization, but this scheme cannot be
employed in the numerical calculations.2 In vacuum the
regularization can be done easily by subtracting a con-
stant term Πab
µν(0). In the medium one has to be more
careful to preserve the thermal and dense gluon Debye
masses ∼ T 2, µ2 and to ensure that they agree with weak
coupling results. We therefore use a scheme similar to
the one proposed by Brown and Pennington [20] which
deﬁnes the regularized vacuum polarization ΠBP
reg (k) by

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

Decomposing Πµν into a transverse and a (4-dimensional)
longitudinal part,

Πµν(k) = TµνΠT (k) + LµνΠL(k),

(19)

the regularized gluon polarization is given by

ΠBP
reg (k) = ΠT (k) − ΠL(k).

(20)

Alternatively, we can subtract ΠL(0) instead of ΠL(k).
This only removes a constant contribution ∼ Λ2, i.e.,
only the divergent contribution. After renormalization
as deﬁned below, both subtraction schemes give identical
results for bare quarks. However, for numerical reasons,
we prefer to subtract ΠL(0). Extending this scheme to
the medium, the regularized polarizations are thus given
by

ΠT T,reg(k) = ΠT T (k) − ΠL(0)
ΠT L,reg(k) = ΠT L(k) − ΠL(0) .

(21)

ized by

Πi,ren(k) = Πi,reg(k) −

k2
ν2 Πi,reg(ν)

(22)

for both components i = T T, T L. Although, in princi-
ple, the subtraction term should be evaluated in vacuum,
in order to achieve numerical convergence we must eval-
uate both polarization functions at the same tempera-
ture and chemical potential, so that the integrands are

4

given at the same momentum mesh. However, the dif-
ference is negligible if the renormalization point is large
enough.We choose the renormalization point at |ν| = 7.65
GeV, which is the scale where the vacuum Yang-Mills
gluon dressing is Z Y M (ν) = 1. For numerical stability,
it is useful to choose the direction of the 4-vector ν to be
equal to the direction of k.

Inserting the renormalized polarization tensor into

Eq. (15), we get the dressed gluon propagator

Some details on the numerical evaluation are given in
Appendix B.

The second quantity which needs to be truncated is the
quark-gluon vertex, which enters the calculation at two
diﬀerent places: in the quark self-energy Σ, Eq. (9), and
in the gluon polarization tensor Π, Eq. (17). In principle,
the same vertex function should be used in both cases,
but, as we will explain, we have to make slightly diﬀerent
choices.

In both cases we take an Abelian part,

Γa

µ,abel(p, q) = γµ

Λa
2

Γ(p, q),

(24)

which is a straight-forward generalization of the bare ver-
tex deﬁned in Eq. (11). Γ(p, q) is a dressing function,
which is modeled to have the correct perturbative run-
ning in the ultraviolet and an infrared enhancement, as
necessary to generate chiral symmetry breaking in vac-
uum. In general it depends on both quark momenta, p
and q, but, as in [1], we use the ansatz Γ(p, q) = Γ(κ2)
with

(cid:18) β0α(ν) ln(κ2/Λ2 + 1)

(cid:19)2δ

(25)

depending only on a single momentum variable κ2.

For the quark self-energy, we identify κ with the gluon
momentum k = p − q, i.e., in Eq. (9) we take Γ(p, q) =
Γ(k2), as also done in [1].
In the gluon polarization
Eq. (17), on the other hand, we need to take an explicit
dependence on quark momenta to preserve renormaliz-
ability.3 This could be realized by taking κ2 = p2 + q2.

B. Truncation of the quark-gluon vertex

expressions reproduce the HTL-HDL results.

2 We checked, however, that for the limiting case of bare prop-
agators in vacuum, our scheme leads to the same result as for
dimensional regularization.

3 For Γ(p, q) = Γ(k2), the vertex does not depend on the integra-
tion variable in Eq. (17) and can be factored out of the integral.
As a consequence, the renormalization condition Eq. (22) does
not give a ﬁnite result anymore. Therefore, the vertex dressing
needs an explicit dependence on the quark momenta.

(26)
As we do not solve the Yang-Mills system explicitly,
we have no information about the ghost sector, so that
the STI cannot be implemented exactly. However, for
color-superconducting phases, the STI protects impor-
tant symmetries which are crucial to reproduce the weak-
coupling limits for the Debye and Meissner masses, cal-
culated in Refs. [23, 24]. Therefore we can use the weak-
coupling calculations as a guide how to implement the
STI approximately.

If we assume H a(p, q) = g(p, q) Λa

tion g(p, q), the STI reduces to a restriction similar to

This identity can be used to give constraints to the quark-
gluon vertex as proposed by Ball and Chiu [25]. The Ball-
Chiu vertex ensures a transverse quark contribution to
the gluon polarization, kµkνΠab
µν(k) = 0. This is a strict
requirement in QED, while in QCD longitudinal parts
are in gereral allowed, as discussed before. Therefore, we
require Eq. (27) only to be fulﬁlled in the weak-coupling
limit. In that case the quark propagators have a simple
color-superconducting self-energy

Φ+(p) = φi(p)γ5Mi,

(28)

with matrices Mi = M2SC for the 2SC phase and Mi =
Msing/oct for the CFL phase, which are deﬁned in Ap-
pendix A. Using this self-energy in Eq. (27) and con-
structing the Ball-Chiu vertex, we obtain

conducting phases, this reduces to the Abelian vertex
Eq. (24). Moreover, since Γa
µ,CSC is purely longitudinal,
it does not contribute to the quark self-energy, Eq. (9),
where it is attached to the transverse gluon propagator.
In the gluon polarization, on the other hand, it enters
through the longitudinal subtraction terms in Eq. (21)
and is therefore crucial for a consistent subtraction in
color superconducting phases.

FIG. 3. Vacuum quark mass function M (p) = B1(p)/C1(p)
for chiral up and down quarks in HTL-HDL approximation
and with the improved gluon propagator for two diﬀerent val-
ues of the bare strange-quark mass.

However, since p4 and q4, as deﬁned below Eq. (1), con-
tain a term iµ, the vertex function would then become
complex and even have singularities which are not associ-
ated with a physical process. In order to avoid these un-
wanted eﬀects but keep the renormalizability, in the po-
larization functions we therefore take Γ(p, q) = Γ(˜p2+˜q2),
where ˜p and ˜q, correspond to p and q at µ = 0, i.e., we
drop the iµ terms. Minor artifacts related to this choice
will be discussed in in Sec. VI.

For the parameters in Eq. (25) we adopt the values of
Ref. [1]. The only exception is the parameter d1, which is
reﬁtted to obtain a critical temperature of Tc = 150 MeV
for the chiral phase transition at µ = 0. Recalling that in
HTL-HDL approximation the vacuum contribution of the
gluon polarization by the quarks is neglected, the overall
screening in the selfconsistent scheme is stronger, so that
more IR enhancement is needed in order to compensate
for it. We ﬁnd d1 = 14 GeV2, which is about 50% higher
than the value in [1].

The corresponding mass functions for up and down
quarks in vacuum are shown in Fig. 3 in comparison with
the result of our previous work in HDL-HTL approxi-
mation [1]. It is clearly visible that the improved trun-
cation results in lower quark masses. In particular the
values at low momenta are closer to typical constituent
quark masses in phenomenological models. Note that,
because of the strange-quark contribution to the gluon
polarization, the up- and down-quark mass functions de-
pend slightly on the bare strange-quark mass, which was
not the case in HDL-HTL approximation.

For the pion decay constant, which can be calculated
via the Pagels-Stokar formula [21], we ﬁnd fπ = 95 MeV.
This is much closer to the empirical value of 92.4 MeV
than the HTL-HDL result of our previous work, where
we obtained 127 MeV.

In general, the quark-gluon vertex is constrained by
a Slavnov-Taylor identity (STI), which connects it with

After specifying the truncation, the coupled quark and
gluon DSEs form a closed system and can be solved nu-
merically. As in our previous publication, we consider
chiral up and down quarks and two diﬀerent values of
the strange-quark mass, ms(ν) = 30 MeV and ms(ν) =
54 MeV, at a renormalization scale of ν = 100 GeV. This
mass range can be motivated by a perturbative evolution
of the PDG values [26] to that scale [1].

FIG. 4. 2SC and CFL solutions of the diquark condensates
at T = 10 MeV as functions of the chemical potential for
ms = 30 MeV (top) and ms = 54 MeV (bottom).

In Fig. 4 we show our solutions for the diquark conden-
sates at T = 10 MeV as functions of the chemical poten-
tial. We have always indicated the corresponding pairing
pattern, i.e., 2SC or CFL, to which these solutions cor-
respond. In addition, there are sometimes diﬀerent solu-
tions with the same pairing pattern, which mainly diﬀer
by the dressed strange-quark mass, as shown in Fig. 5.
Both ﬁgures should therefore be viewed together for a
proper interpretation of the results.

The diquark condensates are qualitatively similar to
the HTL-HDL case in our previous study. While the
CFL condensates can only be formed with relatively light
strange quarks, 2SC pairing is also possible for heavy
strange quarks, as these quarks are not part of the con-
densates. However, due to the back-coupling, the strange
quarks also have an inﬂuence on the 2SC condensates, as
is evident from the discontinous behavior. This is the
main diﬀerence to the HTL-HDL truncation.

the

Again we have also indicated the pairing pattern, to
which the solutions belong.

As already mentioned, the two branches of the 2SC
solutions mainly correspond to diﬀerent values of Ms.
Although in the 2SC phase only up and down quarks
are paired, the strange quarks have an impact on the di-
quark condensates through the polarization loop in the
gluon propagator.
In turn, the pairing leads to a visi-
ble diﬀerence between the masses of red/green and blue
strange quarks in the 2SC phase, since the asymmetry
between paired (red/green) and unpaired (blue) light
quarks translates via the gluons also to the strange sec-
tor. Both eﬀects are not present in the simpler HDL-HTL
truncation [1], where the gluon propagator is not aﬀected
by chiral and diquark condensates.

Above a threshold of around µ = 500 MeV or µ = 600
MeV for ms = 30 MeV or ms = 54, respectively, CFL
pairing is possible. The CFL condensates show no qual-
itative diﬀerence to the HTL-HDL approximation and
increase smoothly with rising chemical potential. In con-
trast to the 2SC solutions, the CFL quark masses of blue
and red/green quarks do not diﬀer markedly, as the pair-
ing is almost symmetric.

T = 10 MeV on the chemical potential for ms = 30 MeV

FIG. 6. Dependence of 2SC and CFL condensates on tem-
perature for ms = 30 MeV at µ = 580 MeV (top) and for
ms = 54 MeV at µ = 680 MeV (bottom).

The dependence of the condensates on temperature at
a ﬁxed chemical potential of µ = 580 MeV for ms =
30 MeV and of µ = 680 MeV for ms = 54 MeV is shown
in Fig. 6. These chemical potentials are inside the region
where a CFL solution and two branches of 2SC solutions
exist. The upper and the lower branch correspond to
the higher and the lower value of Ms, respectively. Sim-
ilar to the HTL-HDL case, the 2SC solutions extend to
higher temperatures than the CFL solution. The solu-
tion with the lower strange-quark mass goes smoothly
down to zero, suggesting a second-order phase transition
to the normal-conducting phase at this point. An im-
portant quantitative diﬀerence is that the 2SC solutions
exist up to critical temperatures of about 40 − 50 MeV,
while with HTL-HDL truncation we found critical tem-
peratures of only about 20 MeV [1].

In order to determine the phase structure at given tem-
perature and chemical potential, we should in principle
compare the pressure of the diﬀerent solutions, which is
given by the eﬀective action from which the DSEs can be
derived. In practice this usually turns out to be numer-
ically very diﬃcult, even when the analytical expression
for the eﬀective action is known. Unfortunately, in the

present truncation scheme, we even do not have an an-
alytic expression for the eﬀective action.4 Hence, if we
have more than one solution, we can in general not de-
cide, which of them is favored. However, as motivated
in [1], we expect that the stability of the numerical it-
eration is a measure of the thermodynamical stability of
the phase. In particular, the iteration only converges to
thermodynamically stable or metastable solutions, and
the disappearance of the numerical solution at a certain
temperature or chemical potential signals that this so-
lution turns thermodynamically unstable at that point.
This picture is corroborated by the fact that in Fig. 5 the
onset of the 2SC solution with the lower Ms is at a higher

4 Besides details of the regularization of the gluon polarization,
this is mainly related to our ansatz for the dressed quark-gluon
vertex, which contains the anomalous components of the quark
self-energy, see Eq. (30), but cannot be derived from a diagram.
Strictly speaking, this means that the present truncation scheme
is thermodynamically not fully consistent. However, in compar-
ison with the HTL-HDL scheme, we believe that the merits of
the improved truncation outweigh the possible errors related to
this inconsistency.

ﬁrst-order transition (below the tricritical point indicated
by “CP”) becomes remarkably large, and we were not
even able to ﬁnd the exact position of the upper spinodal
anymore. Therefore the region is indicated only approx-
imately.

The chiral phase transition seems to be quite robust
under the variation of the bare strange-quark mass, al-
though the critical point is shifted to higher temperatures
and lower chemical potentials when increasing ms(ν). We
ﬁnd the critical point around (T, µ) = (100, 160) MeV for
ms = 30 MeV and (T, µ) = (120, 120) MeV for ms = 54
MeV. A similar study in [9] ﬁnds a critical endpoint at
T = 100 MeV and µ = 190 MeV and sees the same quali-
tative change in comparison with the HTL-HDL approx-
imation. However, it should be noted that the regular-
ization of the quark loop and the vertex truncation were
done in a slightly diﬀerent way in that work.

As in Ref.

[1], our main focus lies on the color-
superconducting phases at higher chemical potentials.
We ﬁnd a CFL-like phase at high µ and a 2SC phase at
intermediate µ as well as in a small band at intermediate
temperature, separating the CFL phase and the normal-
conducting phase. Qualitatively, this phase structure
is similar to the HTL-HDL case. On the other hand,
there are some important diﬀerences. The coupling of
the strange quarks to the light sector leads to a splitting
of the 2SC phase into two phases which are not continu-
ously connected: a phase where Ms is relatively large and
a phase where it is considerably smaller. Therefore, we
ﬁnd a large spinodal region where four phases - the CFL
phase, the two 2SC phases and the normal-conducting
phase - meet, and all phase transitions between these
phases are of ﬁrst order. In the lower-temperature part
of this region, the normal-conducting phase becomes un-
stable with respect to the color-superconducting phases
(not explicitly indicated in the phase diagram). Although
we cannot make a deﬁnite statement, we expect most
of this lower-temperature part to be in the CFL phase,
as the 2SC solutions are numerically much less stable.5
This would mean that the strange-quark transition at low
temperature is shifted to lower chemical potentials than
it would occur within the 2SC or the normal conducting
phase. Again, this can be explained by the additional
condensation energy due to the CFL pairing.

Except for the spinodal region, the transition between
2SC and normal-conducting phase is of second-order and
takes place between T = 40 and 60 MeV. In general,
the critical temperature rises with increasing chemical
potential, but drops suddenly at the strange-quark phase
transition.

Although the bare strange-quark mass has some inﬂu-
ence on the critical point of the chiral phase transition,

5 This means that for most starting values the iterative solution of
the DSE converges to the CFL solution, whereas the 2SC solution
is only found if the starting values are already very close to this
solution.

areas bounded by spinodal lines (dashed). Solid lines indicate

chemical potential than the onset of the CFL solution:
The energy gain due to CFL condensation can exceed
the energy gain due to the dynamical mass generation
and therefore a solution with lower mass gets stabilized
earlier.

According to the above assumption,

second-order
phase transitions can be located precisely, while in the
case of ﬁrst-order phase transitions we can only deter-
mine the spinodal regions, i.e., the regions where two or
more at least metastable solutions coexist. First-order
transitions between these solutions are then restricted
to the spinodal region.
In this context, an additional
complication arises from the impact of the strange-quark
phase transition on the non-strange sector. As a conse-
quence, sometimes more than two solutions coexist, so
that it is not even always clear between which phases
a phase transition takes place in the spinodal region.
Therefore the phase diagrams, which are displayed in
Fig. 7, have a more complicated structure with much
larger spinodal regions than in the HTL-HDL case shown
in Ref. [1]. Especially the spinodal region of the chiral

the color-superconducting section and especially the 2SC
phase are quite independent of ms. The main diﬀerence
is that the onset of CFL condensation, together with the
phase transition between the two 2SC phases, is shifted to
larger chemical potentials for the larger ms. The critical
temperature to the normal-conducting phase only shows
a weak dependence on the ms.

These masses are called Debye and Meissner masses and
account for the electric and magnetic screening of the
gluons. For non-superconducting phases the Meissner
masses are equal to 0 due to the unbroken gauge symme-
try. For color superconductivity, the SUc(3) color sym-
metry is spontaneously broken. The resulting Goldstone
bosons are “eaten” by the gluons giving rise to magnetic
gluon masses via the Anderson-Higgs mechanism [27, 28].
For the 2SC phase the SUc(3) is broken down to SUc(2)
giving rise to 5 massive gluons while the remaining 3 glu-
ons stay massless. For the CFL phase the whole SUc(3)
group is broken and hence all 8 gluons acquire Meissner
masses.

Before presenting the results for our coupled DSE sys-
tem, we check the validity of our truncation by compar-
ing the Debye and Meissner masses with weak-coupling
results given in [23, 24]. To this end, we use simple prop-
agators with selfenergies

Φ+ = φiγ5Mi,

(37)

as in Eq. (28), but with constant gaps φi. For the color-
ﬂavor structure, determined by the matrices Mi, we con-
sider a 2SC phase with Nf = 2, i.e., Mi = M2SC, see

V. DEBYE AND MEISSNER MASSES

Due to dressing, the gluons acquire eﬀective masses.
These are deﬁned by the full gluonic polarization tensors
at zero momentum. Here we focus on the quark contri-

6 As we do not solve the gluon DSE and do not know the value of
the gluon renormalization constant Z3, these masses are strictly
speaking not the Debye and Meissner masses but renormaliza-
tion point dependent objects, which depend on Z3. They are
a qualitative measure for the Debye and Meissner masses but
cannot be compared quantitatively with the HTL-HDL results.

quarks, i.e., Mi = Moct/sing, see Eq. (A4).

The results for the 2SC phase at T = 10 MeV and
µ = 1000 MeV are shown in Fig. 8, where the squared
Debye and Meissner masses for the diﬀerent gluons are
displayed as functions of the gap parameter φ = φ2SC
and compared with the weak-coupling results of [23]. In
addition to the simple propagator parametrization, the
weak-coupling limit assumes T (cid:28) φ (cid:28) µ. This is ful-
ﬁlled best for φ around 100 MeV where we ﬁnd good
agreement between the weak-coupling results and our re-
sults. For larger and smaller values there are some devi-
ations. For the Debye mass of gluons 1-3 a temperature
dependent weak-coupling result is provided in Ref. [23],
which coincides exactly with our calculation. The Meiss-
ner mass of the gluons 1-3 vanishes exactly, as they cor-
respond to the SUc(2) subgroup which stays unbroken
in the 2SC phase. In addition, the Debye mass of gluon
1-3 also tends towards 0 for low temperature. These glu-
ons can only couple to red or green quarks, which are all
bound in Cooper pairs for 2 ﬂavors. Therefore, the quark
loop gives no contribution and no Debye mass is gener-
ated. All other gluons acquire both, Debye and Meissner
masses.

The corresponding results for the CFL phase are shown
in Fig. 9 as functions of φ = φoct = 1
2 φsing. As the break-
ing pattern is symmetric in color and ﬂavor, all gluons
acquire the same Debye and Meissner masses. The weak-
coupling results [24] are shown again for comparison and
agree reasonably well in the region where T (cid:28) φ (cid:28) µ.
It is worth to mention that the oﬀ-diagonal vertex con-
tributions Eq. (30) are essential to reproduce the weak-
coupling results.

Finally we also show the Debye and Meissner masses
for the full DSE calculations for ms = 30 MeV in Fig. 10
and ms = 54 MeV in Fig. 11. At low chemical potentials
all masses are small as the Debye masses are suppressed
by the heavy quark masses and Meissner masses are zero
in non-color-superconducting phases. In this region, we
actually ﬁnd that the squared Debye mass slighly de-
creases and becomes negative. Small negative squared
Debye masses are not forbidden in principle, as there is
always a positive Yang-Mills contribution to the Debye
mass, so that the sum of Yang-Mills and quark contri-
bution can still be positive. On the other hand, the ob-
served behavior also violates the so-called Silver-Blaze
property, which requires observables and also the Debye
mass at T = 0 to be independent of the chemical po-
tential, if the latter is smaller than the mass gap of the
theory. Although the calculations have been performed
at T = 10 MeV, the mass change is mostly an artifact
of the vertex approximation. This will be discussed in
detail in the next section.

At µ = 300−400 MeV, there is a ﬁrst-order phase tran-
sition to the 2SC phase. Similar to the weak-coupling
results, gluons 1-3 have no or only small Meissner and
Debye masses, and the relative ordering of the gluon
masses is the same as in the weak-coupling approxima-

10

tion. At higher chemical potential also the strange quarks
undergo a phase transition and become light. Therefore,
the strange quark loop gives larger contributions and in-
creases the Debye masses of all gluons equally while it
does not contribute to the Meissner masses.

CFL pairing is possible for µ larger than 450 or 550

this phase, the Debye and Meissner masses of all 8 glu-
ons become similar due to the symmetric pairing pattern,
like in the weak-coupling limit. The deviations originate
from the ﬁnite strange-quark mass and diminish with in-
creasing µ, as the mass becomes negligible with respect
to the chemical potential. Both values of ms give very
similar results, the main diﬀerence being the position of
the strange quark phase transition.

VI. SILVER-BLAZE PROPERTY

The Silver-Blaze property (SBP) [29, 30] states that
in a relativistic system at zero temperature, the parti-
tion function and observables do not depend on chemical
potential if the latter stays below the mass gap ∆ of
the system. Although the Lagrangian of the theory and
various related quantities (like propagators) depend on
µ, observables, such as the pole masses of physical parti-
cles, must stay constant, i.e., the internal µ-dependencies
must cancel each other. If the chemical potential exceeds
the mass gap, states can be excited and observables may
change. The SBP only holds at zero temperature, as
thermal excitations also change observables.

In strong-interaction matter at T = 0 and nonzero
baryon chemical potential µB = 3µ, the physical thresh-
old is given by µB = mN − Eb, where mN is the nucleon
mass and Eb = 16 MeV is the binding energy in nuclear
matter. Since nucleons and nuclear binding are not ex-
plicitly contained in the present truncation scheme, the
threshold should be the transition point to deconﬁned
quark matter, i.e., the phase transition to the 2SC phase.
In contrast to this expectation, the Debye masses
shown in Figs. 10 and 11 are µ dependent at arbitrar-
ily small chemical potentials. As mentioned earlier, the
calculations have been performed at a ﬁnite temperature
of T = 10 MeV, but this is too small to explain the
observed variations of the Debye masses. On the other
hand, the SBP can easily be violated by truncations. In
the following, we discuss this in more detail.

We consider a system with a physical mass gap ∆,
meaning that the real-time quark propagator as well as
the gluon propagator and the quark-gluon vertex in vac-
uum do not have non-analytic structures for energies
lower than ∆. Turning to the Matsubara formalism, the
Euclidean momentum component p4 = ωn + iµ becomes
continuous at T = 0. Writing p4 = ˜p4 + iµ and suppress-
ing the dependence on (cid:126)p, the quark self-energy is then
schematically given by

(cid:90)

Σ(˜p4 + iµ) ∼

S(˜q4 + iµ)K(˜p4 + iµ, ˜q4 + iµ) ,

(38)

˜q4

11

FIG. 10. Meissner (top) and Debye (bottom) masses squared for the 2SC phase (left) and the CFL phase (right) for ms = 30
MeV.

with an integration kernel K(p4, q4). By the assumption
speciﬁed above, the integrand is analytic in the entire
region between Im ˜q4 = 0 and Im ˜q4 = ∆. Hence, if
µ < ∆, the substitution ˜q4 + iµ → ˜q4 and shifting the
path of integration back to the real axis does not alter
the value of the integral, i.e., we obtain

i.e., this integral, which arises when calculating the quark
condensate, is independent of µ. Hence, while the quark
propagator itself has a µ-dependence (via its energy ar-
gument, S(q4) ≡ S(˜q4 + iµ)), the condensate is constant,
reﬂecting the Silver Blaze property.
Similarly, the gluon polarization integral, schemati-

Σ(˜p4 + iµ) ∼

S(˜q4)K(˜p4 + iµ, ˜q4) ,

(39)

˜q4

which depends on the chemical potential only through
the external energy variable. The selfenergy is therefore
given by the same function as in vacuum, Σ(˜p4 + iµ) ≡
Σvac(˜p4 +iµ), and the chemical potential only determines
the complex argument at which this function is to be
evaluated. For chemical potentials higher than ∆, on
the other hand, the singularity caused by this mass gap
prevents the shift of the integration path, and therefore
the selfenergy is not simply an analytical continuation of
the vacuum function.

Obviously, the same holds for the dressed quark prop-
agator, which is related to Σ via the DSE. For µ < ∆ an
analogous shift then yields

S(˜q4 +iµ)S(˜p4 +iµ) ˜K(˜p4 +iµ, ˜q4 +iµ), (41)

with ˜p4 = k4 + ˜q4, is independent of µ for µ < ∆, and
therefore also Debye and Meissner masses are constant.
A technical requirement for these properties to hold
is that the integrands, i.e., the quark propagators and
the kernels K or ˜K, consistently depend on the quark
momenta shifted by iµ, so that the µ-dependence can be
removed by performing a shift of the integration variable.
Indeed, this is always fulﬁlled if the kernel is microscop-
ically calculated from Feynman diagrams.

In our calculations, however, we make the model ansatz
Γ(p, q) = Γ(κ2), Eq. (25), so that it depends on the choice
of κ whether the SBP is preserved. In the quark DSE,
we use κ2 = (p − q)2, which is consistent with the SBP.
For the gluon-polarization loops, on the other hand, we

4 + (cid:126)p 2 + ˜q2

take κ2 = ˜p2 + ˜q2 = ˜p2
4 + (cid:126)q 2, which violates the
SBP, since ˜p4 and ˜q4 are not shifted by iµ. As discussed in
Sec. III B, we made this choice, because the formally more
consistent ansatz κ2 = p2 + q2 would lead to unphysical
singularities in the vertex function, which we consider to
be a more severe problem than the vioalation of the SBP.

In fact, the violation is negligible on the quark level, as
can be seen in Fig. 12. The quark condensate calculated
within the present truncation scheme (blue solid line)
stays almost constant as a function of µ, showing only a
tiny increase near the phase transition. For comparison
we also show the condensate in the HTL-HDL truncation
scheme (red dashed line). In HTL-HDL approximation,
the gluon propagator is is dressed by massless quarks,
giving the gluons an eﬀective mass m2
g ∼ µ2. This causes
a strong violation of the SBP, which is clearly visible in
the ﬁgure. Hence, taking into account the quarks in the
gluon polarization self-consistently leads to a large im-
provement, while the violation of the SBP by the vertex
ansatz is negligible.

In the ﬁgure we also show the light quark “mass”
M (0) ≡ (B1(p)/C1(p))|(cid:126)p=(cid:126)0,p4=πT +iµ for both truncation
schemes. The µ dependence which is visible in both
cases does not allow to make a statement about the SBP
because M (0) is not an observable, and the quark self-

energy depends on µ through its momentum argument,
cf. Eq. (39).

For the Debye masses of the improved truncation,

in the 2SC or CFL phases. Altogether we can safely state
that the improved truncation respects the SBP approxi-
mately, with the violations being negligibly small in the
quark sector and not too big in the gluonic sector.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Within the Dyson-Schwinger approach we have stud-
ied 2SC and CFL-like phases in QCD with 2 + 1 ﬂavors
with chiral light quarks and strange quarks of ﬁnite bare
mass ms. To explore the sensitivy of the results, two
values, ms = 30 MeV and ms = 54 MeV at a renormal-
ization scale of ν = 100 GeV, were chosen. Going beyond
our previous work [1], which employed the HTL-HDL ap-
proximation, the quark eﬀects on the gluon propagator
are now taken into account selfconsistently through fully
dressed Nambu-Gorkov quark propagators. The adopted
truncation and regularization schemes were inspired by a
Brown-Pennington projection and Slavnov-Taylor identi-
ties. Guided by the most up-to-date lattice results for the
equations of state at vanishing chemical potential [2, 3]
we have ﬁtted the vertex parameters to a chiral critical
temperature of 150 MeV for both values of ms. As an
improvement to [1] this also yields a good description of
the pion decay constant in vacuum, and we now obtain
more realistic vacuum values of the dressed light-quark
masses with little sensitivity to the choice of ms.

For the color-superconducting phases the critical tem-
peratures go up to 40 − 60 MeV. In contrast to the
HTL-HDL approximation, the light-quark sector is now
coupled to the strange sector through the quark loops
in the gluon polarization function. As a consequence
we ﬁnd two distinct 2SC phases, separated by a ﬁrst-
order phase transition with a discontinuous change in
the dressed strange-quark mass. The main eﬀect of in-
creasing the bare strange-quark mass ms is shifting the
2SC-CFL boundary to higher µ and the location of the
chiral critical point to higher T and lower µ. The criti-
cal temperatures from the color superconducting to the
normal conducting regime, on the other hand, show only
a weak dependence on ms.

We have also calculated the gluonic Debye and Meiss-
ner masses in the diﬀerent color channels and phases.
As a test for our truncation scheme, we ﬁrst calculated
the masses in the weak-coupling limit and found agree-
ment with the corresponding predictions in the litera-
ture [23, 24]. To achieve this a proper construction of
the quark-gluon vertex, containing anomalous contribu-
tions, was crucial. The results of the full calculations in
the strong-coupling regime are qualitatively similar. Es-
pecially the gluonic masses have the same hierarchy as in
the weak-coupling limit.

Although the selfconsistent treatment of the quark
propagators in the gluon polarization is a signiﬁcant im-
provement to the HTL-HDL approximation, there are
still some features missing in the truncation. The gluon

13

propagator can be further improved by including quark
eﬀects to the Yang-Mills sector as these may have an
inﬂuence on the Yang-Mills screening mass. Even more
important would be an improvement of the vertex trunca-
tion. Although the vertex we use is partially constrained
by Slavnov-Taylor identities and the correct UV behav-
ior, it contains nevertheless a consideral amount of mod-
eling. This does not only reduce the predictive power of
the approach but also leads to artifacts, like the violation
of the Silver-Blaze property. It would thus be desireable
to calculate the vertex function explicitly from the cor-
responding DSE. This has already been studied in vac-
uum [31–33], but unfortunately becomes much more dif-
ﬁcult in the medium. Finally, a truncation that provides
an analytic expression for the eﬀective action should be
considered in the future, as it allows to calculate pressure
diﬀerences between the phases and therefore the location
of the ﬁrst-order transitions in the phase diagram.

This basis allows for a consistent parametrization of
CFL-like pairing for 2+1 ﬂavors, where the corresponding

amplitude functions are all diﬀerent in general. On the
other hand there are simplifying cases, where a smaller
number of terms is suﬃcient.
In the 2SC phase the
anomalous self-energy Φ+ is proportional to a single
color-ﬂavor matrix given by

M2SC = M1 − M2

Appendix B: Numerical details

In Section III A, we have presented our truncation
scheme of the gluon DSE. A direct calculation of the reg-
ularized quark polarization loop Eq. (21) is, although in
principle ﬁnite, still numerically unstable, as it includes
a complicated cancellation of the divergencies which can-
not be achieved numerically. We therefore subtract ad-
ditional regulators Πi,sub = ˜Πi(0) − ˜ΠL(0) where ˜Πi
corresponds to the vacuum expression for the polariza-
tion function Πi, but evaluated with quark propagators
˜S(p4, (cid:126)p), where the real parts of the in-medium results
for the A, B and C functions are used and interpolated
to continuous p4. The regularized polarization functions
are therefore

Πi,reg(k) = Πi(k) − ΠL(0) − (Πi(0) − ΠL(0))T =0,µ=0 ,
(B1)
for both components i = T T /T L. If all terms have the
same integration nodes for large integration momenta,
this expression converges numerically, independent of the
coarseness of the nodes, as there is always a pair of terms

14

Π − ΠT =0,µ=0 which cancel each other’s divergencies. If
Ai(q) = Ci(q), as for example in vacuum, the subtracted
terms Πi,sub can be shown to be zero analytically and
serve solely for numerical stabilization. As Ai(q) and
Ci(q) diﬀer in the medium, the Πi,sub terms are not ex-
actly zero and lead to a small truncation error. Although
the chosen regulators seem to be a bit arbitrary, we have
tested that the result only slightly changes for variations
of the regularization, like setting also Bi(q) = 0 or using
2 (Ai(q) + Ci(q)) instead of Ai(q) and Ci(q) in ˜S(p4, (cid:126)p).

This means that the diﬀerent IR parts of the dressing
functions only have a negligible contribution while the
similar UV parts are stabilizing the numerics. The reg-
ularization is therefore quite robust and we neglect the
error for the beneﬁt of a numerically stable expression
for the polarization function. Without this subtraction,
other approximations like the introduction of a cutoﬀ are
needed for the numerical calculation which usually lead
to larger errors.

Furthermore, with color-superconducting condensates
present, the polarization tensor Πab
µν(k) Eq. (17) is not
necessarily diagonal in color space. For 2SC or CFL-
like phases, block structures arise for (a, b) ∈ {4, 5} and
(a, b) ∈ {6, 7} with the structure
