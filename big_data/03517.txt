ABSTRACT

Context. The Nainital-Cape survey is a dedicated ongoing survey programme to search for and study pulsational variability in chem-
ically peculiar (CP) stars to understand their internal structure and evolution.
Aims.The main aims of this survey are to ﬁnd new pulsating Ap and Am stars in the northern and southern hemisphere and to perform
asteroseismic studies of these new pulsators.
Methods. The survey is conducted using high-speed photometry. The candidate stars were selected on the basis of having Str¨omgren
photometric indices similar to those of known pulsating CP stars.
Results. Over the last decade a total of 337 candidate pulsating CP stars were observed for the Nainital-Cape survey, making it one
of the longest ground-based surveys for pulsation in CP stars in terms of time span and sample size. The previous papers of this series
presented seven new pulsating variables and 229 null results. In this paper we present the light curves, frequency spectra and the
various astrophysical parameters of the 108 additional CP stars observed since the last reported results. We have also tabulated the
basic physical parameters of the known roAp stars. As part of establishing the detection limits in the Nainital-Cape survey, we inves-
tigated the scintillation noise level at the two observing sites used in this survey, Sutherland and Nainital, by comparing the combined
frequency spectra stars observed from each location. Our analysis shows that both the sites permit the detection of variations on the
order of 0.6 milli-magnitude (mmag) in the frequency range 1-4 mHz, with Sutherland being marginally better, on average.

1. Introduction

A chemically peculiar (CP) star can be distinguished from a
chemically normal star by its spectrum, where anomalies can be
seen on a visual inspection of low-dispersion spectra. The opti-
cal spectra of the CP stars exhibit normal hydrogen lines com-
bined with enhanced silicon, metal, and/or rare-earth lines and
weak calcium lines. The chemical peculiarities in these stars re-
sult from the diﬀusion process (Michaud 1970; Michaud et al.
1981; Babel 1992; Richer et al. 2000). Chemical elements with
many lines near ﬂux maximum, such as iron peak and rare earth
elements, are brought up to the surface by the dominance of ra-
diation pressure over gravity in the radiative envelopes of these
stars, causing an apparent over-abundance of such elements. The
elements with few lines near the ﬂux maximum settle gravita-
tionally and appear to be under-abundant. Slow rotation is thus
a basic condition to operate the diﬀusion process in CP stars.
The CP stars are found on the main-sequence between spectral
types B2 and F5, from the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) to
the terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS), and have masses rang-
ing from 1.5 to about 7 M⊙.

Based on their spectroscopic characteristics, Preston (1974)
divided the CP stars into following groups : Am/Fm (CP1),

Ap/Bp (CP2), Hg-Mn (CP3), He weak and He strong (CP4)
stars. Renson & Manfroid (2009) compiled an up-to-date cat-
alogue of 8205 CP stars. A subset of Ap and Am stars shows
photometric variability with periods ranging from a few minutes
to a few hours, and are the focus of the Nainital - Cape survey.

The Am/Fm stars are relatively cool stars of spectral type
F5-A8, with temperatures ranging from 6500 K to 10000 K. The
spectra of these stars exhibit an under-abundance (weak lines)
of Ca or Sc (or of both elements) and over-abundance (strong
lines) of Sr, Eu and other rare-earth elements. Some of the mem-
bers of this group show δ Sct-type pulsational variability (Joshi
et al. 2003, 2006, 2009; Smalley et al. 2011; Catanzaro & Ripepi
2014; Hou et al. 2015). The Am stars rotate slower than chem-
ically normal A-type stars and the frequency of binarity among
these stars is much higher than among normal stars of the same
mass (Abt & Golson 1962, Abt & Snowden 1973). It is well un-
derstood that these stars do not exhibit strong global magnetic
ﬁelds, however based on the observations from Kepler space
mission, Balona et al. (2015) found ﬂares in two Am stars, which
strongly suggests that at least some Am stars possess the signif-
icant magnetic ﬁelds.

The Ap/Bp stars have eﬀective temperatures in the range of
6400 K to 15000 K. These stars exhibit the most conspicuous
chemical anomalies of all the CP stars: enhanced lines of some
elements, particularly Si, Cr, Sr, Mn, Fe, Eu, Gd, and Ce (over-

abundant by up to a factor of 106), and weak lines of light ele-
ments (under-abundant by a factor of 10−2). The Ap stars show
low rotation velocities with ve sin i usually not exceeding 100
kms−1. These stars have strong global magnetic ﬁelds with an
intensity ranging from hundreds of gauss to tens of kilogauss.

The coolest sub-group of Ap stars (6400 K ≤ Te f f ≤ 8700 K)
located near the main-sequence (MS) part of the classical insta-
bility strip, are known as roAp stars. Since the discovery of ﬁrst
roAp star HD 101065 (Kurtz 1978), 61 other members of this
class have been discovered (Smalley et al. 2015). The roAp stars
show pulsational variability in both the broad photometric bands
and in narrow spectral lines. These pulsations are characterized
as high-overtone, low-degree p-modes with typical periods be-
tween 5.6 min and 23.6 min and photometric amplitudes rang-
ing from a few micro-magnitudes (µmag) up to tens of milli-
magnitudes (mmag) and radial velocity (RV) amplitudes rang-
ing from a few ms−1 to kms−1. The roAp stars possess strong
magnetic ﬁelds with typical strengths of a few kG to tens of kG
(Hubrig et al. 2012) with over-abundances of some rare earth
elements that can exceed the solar value by 106 (Ryabchikova
et al. 2004). To date, there have been no roAp stars found in
close binary systems though a few Ap stars are in close bina-
ries. The roAp stars are among the more challenging MS stars
to model due to their pulsations in the combined presence of a
strong global magnetic ﬁeld together with element segregation
and stratiﬁcation, but at the same time they can be considered as
a stellar atomic physics laboratory.

The pulsation frequency spectrum of some of the roAp stars
shows frequency multiplets with spacings corresponding to the
frequency of rotation of the star. This phenomenon can be ex-
plained using the oblique pulsator model (Kurtz 1982), in which
the pulsation axis is aligned with the axis of the magnetic ﬁeld,
which is assumed to be roughly a dipole inclined with respect to
the axis of rotation. As a star rotates, the observed aspect of the
pulsation changes, leading to amplitude modulation and, in some
cases, phase modulation. The driving mechanism of the pulsa-
tions in roAp stars is thought to be the classical κ-mechanism
operating in the partial hydrogen ionization zone (Balmforth et
al. 2001). Cunha & Gough (2001) suggested an alternative ex-
citation mechanism for roAp stars where pulsation is driven by
the turbulent pressure in the convection zone.

Some roAp stars have highly stable pulsation frequencies
and amplitudes, even on time scales of years while other roAp
stars show frequency and amplitude variations on time scales as
short as hours (Medupe et al. 2015). Whether this is a result of
driving and damping, mode coupling or some instability is not
known. It is important to know where in the roAp instability strip
the stable and unstable pulsators lie.

The Kepler mission, launched in 2009 with the aim to detect
and characterize Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, has
revolutionized our ability to detect and study very low-amplitude
light variations of the order of a few µ-mag in rather faint stars
(Koch et al. 2010). The Kepler mission has enabled the discovery
of ﬁve roAp stars, all which have pulsation amplitudes much
below the detection limits of ground-based photometry.

While initially roAp stars were discovered and studied with
photometric methods, time-resolved spectroscopy has allowed
the study of wider physical aspects of the pulsating stellar atmo-
sphere. The rapid radial velocity variations of spectral lines of
certain chemical elements allow us to sample the velocity ﬁeld
in the stellar atmosphere as a function of atmospheric depth. Of
the 61 known roAp stars, about a quarter of them were discov-
ered using spectroscopic methods. A combination of simultane-
ous spectroscopy and photometry constitutes the most sophis-

ticated asteroseismic data set for any roAp star. The observed
phase lag between the variations in luminosity and in RV is an
important parameter for modeling the stellar structure.

Similar to other pulsating stars, the roAp stars are also ex-
cellent asteroseismic candidates through which one can com-
pare the observed frequency spectrum to the asymptotic pul-
sation theory and then obtain information about the spherical
harmonic degrees of the pulsation modes, the distortion of the
modes from normal modes, atmospheric structures, evolution-
ary status and the geometry of the magnetic ﬁeld. Using such
information one can derive the various physical parameters such
as rotation periods, temperatures, luminosities, radii and their
masses (see Joshi & Joshi (2015) for a recent review on astero-
seismology of pulsating stars). Although the extent of the roAp
phenomenon has been fairly well delineated in photometric and
spectroscopic terms, there is as yet no known combination of
these (and other) observable parameters that can be used as a
predictor of pulsation in any given Ap star. In other words, one
can have two Ap stars that are apparently similar in all observ-
able parameters, where one is a pulsating roAp star and the other
has no detectable pulsations and is a so-called “noAp” star.

The Nainital-Cape survey was

initiated in 1999 by
the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences
(ARIES) at Manora Peak, Nainital, India, and the South African
Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland to search for
pulsations in CP stars. The goals of the survey were: (i) to in-
crease the number of known pulsating CP stars; (ii) to determine
the observational limits of the roAp phenomenon; and (iii) to
broaden the number and distribution (in parameter space) of es-
tablished constant (noAp) stars, so as to shed some light on what
distinguishes the pulsating from the apparently constant CP stars
of similar spectral type and other observable physical parame-
ters. This is the only survey of its kind which was conducted
from both the northern and southern hemisphere. The ﬁrst three
papers of this survey described the scope and methods of the sur-
vey and reported the discovery of pulsations in several CP stars
(Martinez et al. 2001; Paper-I, Joshi et al. 2006; Paper-II, Joshi
et al. 2009: Paper-III). The present paper is the fourth in this se-
ries and presents the null results obtained for 108 stars observed
during the period of 2006 to 2009.

Similar to other papers of this series, the present paper is also
based on photoelectric photometry of the sample stars and is or-
ganized as follows: the target selection, observations and data
reduction procedures are described in Section 2, followed by the
frequency analysis of the time series photometric data in Section
3. In Sec. 4, the observational limits for the detection of light
variations at the ARIES and SAAO sites are discussed. The stars
classiﬁed as null results and their basic astrophysical parameters
are given in Sec. 5. In Sec. 6, we provide the basic physical pa-
rameters of all the currently known roAp stars. In this section,
we also compare the evolutionary status of the known roAp stars
to the sample of stars observed under the Nainital-Cape survey.
The statistics of several surveys to search for new roAp stars are
discussed in Sec. 8. Finally, we outline the conclusions drawn
from our study in Sec. 9.

2. Target Selection, Observations and Data

Reduction

2.1. SelectionCriteria

Following the target selection strategy of Martinez et al. (1991),
the primary source of candidates for the Nainital-Cape survey
was the subset of CP stars with Str¨omgren photometric indices

S. Joshi et al.: The Nainital-Cape Survey-IV

3

similar to those of the known roAp stars. In this range, we have
also found many Am stars and included them in the list of tar-
gets. Apart from the sources of target mentioned in Martinez
et al. (1991), we also included Ap/Am stars from Renson et al.
(1991) and magnetic stars from Bychkov et al. (2003).

On the basis of the Str¨omgren photometric indices of known
roAp stars (see Table 1), we have revised the range of indices
that encompass the roAp phenomenon:

0.082 ≤ b − y ≤ 0.431
0.178 ≤ m1 ≤ 0.387
-0.204≤ δm1 ≤ 0.012
0.002 ≤ c1 ≤ 0.870
-0.370≤ δc1 ≤ 0.031

2.64 ≤ β ≤ 2.88

where b − y is the color index and β measures the strength of the
Hβ line, which is indicator of temperature for stars in the spec-
tral range from around A3 to F2. The m1 and c1 indices indicate
enhanced metallicity and increased line blanketing, respectively.
The parameters δm1 and δc1 measure the blanketing diﬀerence
and Balmer discontinuity relative to the ZAMS for a given β,
respectively. Indices in the ranges given above are not an un-
ambiguous indicator of roAp pulsation, although they serve to
narrow down the ﬁeld of candidates to the most promising sub-
set. It is interesting to note that, whereas previously the roAp
phenomenon seemed to be conﬁned to the temperature range of
the δ Scuti instability strip, it now appears that the roAp instabil-
ity strip has a considerably cooler red edge, well into the F-type
stars (see Fig. 2). As can be seen by the paucity of cooler stars
tested for pulsation, this is an area for future work, to establish
more ﬁrmly the cool edge of the roAp instability strip.

2.2. PhotometricObservations

For many roAp stars, the pulsational photometric variations
have amplitudes less than twenty mmag. The detection of
such low-amplitude variations demands high-precision photo-
metric observations that can be attained with fast photome-
ters mounted on small telescopes at observing sites such as
ARIES Nainital in India and SAAO Sutherland South Africa.
The ARIES observations presented in this paper were acquired
using the ARIES high-speed photoelectric photometer (Ashoka
et al. 2001) attached to the 1.04-m Sampurnanand telescope
at ARIES. The SAAO observations were acquired using the
Modular Photometer attached to the 0.5-m telescope and the
University of Cape Town photometer attached to the 0.75-m and
1.0-m telescopes at the Sutherland site of SAAO.

Each star was observed in high-speed photometric mode
with continuous 10-sec integrations through a Johnson B ﬁlter.
The observations were acquired in a single-channel mode (i.e.
no simultaneous comparison star observations), with occasional
interruptions to measure the sky background, depending on the
phase and position of the moon. To minimize the eﬀects of see-
ing ﬂuctuations and tracking errors, we selected a photometric
aperture of 30′′. Each target was observed continuously for 1-3
hours at a time. Since the amplitudes of the rapid photometric
oscillations in roAp stars exhibit modulation due to rotation and
also due to interference among frequencies of diﬀerent pulsation
modes, a null detection for pulsation may be obtained simply
due to a coincidence of the timing of the observations. Hence,
each candidate was observed several times.

2.3. DataReduction

The data reduction process began with a visual inspection of the
light curve to identify and remove obviously bad data points,
followed by correction for coincidence counting losses, subtrac-
tion of the interpolated sky background, and correction for the
mean atmospheric extinction. After applying these corrections,
the time of the mid-point of the each observation was converted
into a heliocentric Julian date (HJD) with an accuracy of 10−5
day (∼1 sec). The reduced data comprise a time-series of HJD
and ∆B magnitude with respect to the mean of the light curve.

3. Frequency Analysis

A fast algorithm (Kurtz 1985) based on Deeming’s discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) for unequally spaced data (Deeming
1975) was used to calculate the Fourier Transformation. The
light curves were also inspected visually for evidence of δ Sct
oscillations with periods of a few tens of minutes and longer.
On these time-scales, single-channel photometric data are af-
fected by sky transparency variations and it is not always possi-
ble to distinguish between oscillations in the star and variations
in sky transparency. This is where the comparison of data of the
same star acquired under diﬀerent conditions on diﬀerent nights
is helpful for conﬁrming the tentative detection of coherent os-
cillations in a given light curve.

After visual inspection of the light curves to search for indi-
cations of δ Sct pulsations in a given light curve on time-scales
longer than about half an hour, we removed the sky transparency
variations from the DFT data in order to reduce the overall noise
level to approximately the scintillation noise. This is practicable
for single-channel data because, on good photometric nights, the
roAp oscillation frequencies are generally well resolved from the
sky transparency variations. To remove the eﬀect of sky trans-
parency variations, the DFT data were prewhitened to remove
signals with frequencies in the range 0 – 0.9 mHz, which is the
frequency range commonly aﬀected by sky transparency varia-
tions in single-channel photometric data. These frequencies were
removed one at a time until the noise level in the DFT of the
residuals approximated a white noise spectrum. Depending on
the stability of the photometric transparency of a given night,
it was generally possible to correct for the eﬀects of sky trans-
parency by removing 3-5 frequencies in the above-mentioned
frequency range.

The ﬁrst and second panels of Fig. 3 show the light curves of
the candidate stars ﬁltered for low-frequency sky transparency
variations. The third and fourth panels show the pre-whitened
amplitude spectra of the sample stars ﬁltered for low-frequency
sky transparency variations.

4. Noise Level Characterization

The detection limit for photometric variability depends upon the
atmospheric noise, which consists of scintillation noise and sky-
transparency variations, and the photon noise. For the brighter (∼
10 mag) stars, the atmospheric scintillation noise dominates over
the photon noise and is one of the fundamental factors limiting
the precision of ground-based photometry. In order to character-
ize the two observing sites used in the Nainital-Cape survey and
to put constraints on the detection limits for low-amplitude vari-
ability, we estimated the observational as well as the theoretical
scintillation noise values for both the sites.

Given a telescope’s altitude, mirror diameter, and the obser-
vational exposure time and airmass, one can ﬁnd the contribu-

tion of scintillation noise in photometric measurements using
Young’s approximation (Young 1967, 1974). Using this scal-
ing relation, it is possible to compare the level of scintillation
noise at diﬀerent observatory sites. Although the precise amount
of scintillation changes from night to night, Young’s scaling re-
lation appears to hold quite well for telescope apertures up to
4-m, and for quite diﬀerent sites (Kjeldsen & Frandsen 1991;
Gilliland & Brown 1992; Gilliland et al. 1993). However recent
studies by Kornilov et al. (2012) and Osborn et. al (2015) showed
that this equation tends to underestimate the median scintillation
noise at several major observatories around the world. Osborn
et. al. (2015) presented a modiﬁed form of Young’s approxima-
tion (equation 1) that uses empirical correction coeﬃcients to
give more reliable estimates of the scintillation noise at a range
of astronomical sites:

σ2
Y = 10 × 10−6C2

Y D−4/3t−1(cos γ)−3 exp (−2hobs/H),

(1)

where CY is the empirical coeﬃcient, D is the diameter of the
telescope, t is the exposure time of the observation, γ is the
zenith distance, hobs is the altitude of the observatory and H
the scale height of the atmospheric turbulence, which is gen-
erally accepted to be approximately 8000-m. All parameters are
in standard SI units. The empirical coeﬃcients CY for the ma-
jor observatories around the world are listed by Osborne et al.
(2015).

The theoretical values of scintillation noise for Sutherland
and Nainital were estimated using equation 1. The scintillation
noise in terms of amplitude was obtained by taking the square
root of σY. However, in order to compare the two sites having
diﬀerent telescope diameters, we have to scale the theoretical
values. Therefore, the theoretical scintillation noise for SAAO
(50-cm telescope) was scaled to the aperture of the ARIES tele-
scope (104-cm) using the same relation. The input parameters
used to estimate the theoretical scintillation noise are : height
(ARIES: 1958-m, SAAO : 1798-m), sec(Z) (airmass) : 1, CY :
1.5, integration time : 10-sec. The estimated scintillation values
of ARIES (D:104-cm) and SAAO (D:50-cm) are 0.0338 mmag
and 0.0433 mmag, respectively. The scaled value of the scintil-
lation noise for SAAO (scaled to 104-cm) is 0.0340 mmag. Fig.
1 shows the theoretical noise levels for the ARIES and SAAO
sites (both scaled and unscaled).

Since the observations in the Nainital-Cape survey were car-
ried out over many nights, and in a variety of atmospheric con-
ditions, the noise levels in the Fourier spectra of the individual
light curves are expected to be higher than the theoretical scin-
tillation values for each site, and they are also not expected to
be white noise. In order to estimate the observational values of
the noise in our amplitude spectra as a function of frequency,
we ﬁrst transformed the time-series data of stars observed from
ARIES during 2006-2009 and from SAAO during 2006-2007
into their individual periodograms. We then combined all the
periodograms from each site into a single pseudo-periodogram
and ﬁtted an acspline function to obtain the average estimated
noise proﬁle as a function of frequency. These observational
noise curves are shown in Fig. 1 in solid blue for ARIES and
dot-dashed red for SAAO. These noise proﬁles provide a useful
ﬁrst check of the signiﬁcance of possible oscillation frequencies
identiﬁed in the Fourier spectra in Fig. 3 of this paper.

More than half of the known roAp stars were discovered pho-
tometrically from SAAO. One of the basic reasons behind this is
that the Sutherland site has stable and good sky transparency, al-
lowing a closer match to scintillation noise than at many other
observing sites used in other roAp surveys. However, in the last

Fig. 1. The noise characteristics for the ARIES site at Nainital
and the SAAO Sutherland site. The acspline-ﬁtted curve of
ARIES and SAAO amplitude spectra are shown in solid blue
and dot-dashed red curve, respectively. The theoretical scintilla-
tion noise levels of ARIES and SAAO are shown by blue long-
dashed and red small-dashed horizontal lines, respectively, and
the scintillation noise level of SAAO (scaled to 104cm diameter)
is also shown in green dotted horizontal line.

ten years that we have been running the Nainital-Cape Survey,
we have noticed a gradual increase in sky brightness and atmo-
spheric noise owing to enhanced human activities around the
ARIES and Sutherland observatories. It can be inferred from the
scaling relation (eqn. 1) that the combined atmospheric noise
can be minimized by installing bigger telescopes at a good ob-
serving site where one can ﬁnd stable photometric sky condi-
tions (Young 1967). A new 1.3-m optical telescope is now oper-
ational at a new astronomical site of ARIES observatory known
as Devasthal (longitude: 79o40′57′′ E, latitude : 29o22′26′′ N,
altitude : 2420-m). In addition, a new 3.6-m telescope has been
recently installed at the Devasthal site and is likely to be op-
erational by 2016. The theoretical scintillation noise estimated
for this telescope is 0.0217 mmag making the telescope very ef-
ﬁcient for detecting tiny amplitude variations. The 0.5-m tele-
scope of SAAO is also soon to be replaced with a 1.0-m robotic
telescope. These up-coming observing facilities equipped with
modern state-of-the-art instruments at ARIES and SAAO will be
the next step to boost the Nainital-Cape survey and other projects
aimed at the detection of sub-mmag light variations.

5. New Null Results from the Nainital-Cape Survey

In this paper we report the non-detections of pulsation in 108
CP stars. The ﬁrst and second panels of Fig. 3 depict the light
curves of the candidate stars observed from ARIES and SAAO.
The pre-whitened frequency spectra of the respective time-series
are plotted in the third and fourth columns. The name of the
star, duration of observations in hours and the heliocentric Julian
dates are marked in each panel.

Here it is worth recalling that roAp stars show amplitude
modulation due to rotation and beating between multiple pulsa-
tion frequencies. Therefore, the non-detection of light variations
may be due to fact that the observations are acquired at a time
when the pulsations are below the detection limit of the survey.
For example, Joshi et al. (2006) classiﬁed HD 25515 as a null
result and then subsequently, after further observations, classi-
ﬁed it as a δ Scuti type pulsating variable (Joshi et al. 2009).
Hence, a null-detection of pulsations does not mean that the star
is non-variable, but rather that its light output was not detected
to vary during the particular interval of the observations. This
demonstrates the necessity for repeated observations of the can-
didate stars. These null results are also an important contribu-
tion toward understanding the distinction between pulsating and
non-pulsating CP stars that are otherwise similar in all other ob-
servational respects (Murphy et al. 2015). As mentioned above,
a by-product of these null results is an observational character-
isation of a particular observing site for data acquired on many
nights over a wide range of observing conditions.

6. Comparison of Known roAp Stars with the Null

Results

At the time the Nainital-Cape survey began, only 23 roAp stars
were known. Therefore, our knowledge of the extent of the roAp
phenomenon at that time was used to deﬁne the target selec-
tion and observing strategy. Since then, the number of known
roAp stars has more than doubled, and currently stands at 61
conﬁrmed members of this class. The compilation of the various
physical parameters of the known roAp stars are important to
study the roAp and noAp (“non-roAp”) phenomena in Ap stars.
Tables 1 and 2 list the astrophysical parameters of the known
roAp stars extracted from the available sources in the literature.
For each star Table 1 lists, respectively, the table entry number,
the HD number of roAp star, their popular name, spectral type,
Str¨omgren indices b − y, m1, c1, β, δm1, δc1, eﬀective tempera-
ture Te f f , and the reference(s) from which the data were taken.
Table 2 lists the table entry number, the HD or HR catalogue
number and other name(s) of the roAp star, the visual magni-
tude mv, parallax π , distance d, absolute magnitude Mv, lumi-
nosity parameter log ( L⋆
), pulsational period corresponding to
L⊙
the highest amplitude, the frequency separation ∆µ, maximum
photometric amplitude variation Amax, maximum radial veloc-
ity variation RVmax, rotational period Prot, surface gravity log g,
mass M⋆, radius R⋆, mean longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld and the
projected rotational velocity vsini. Where no data is available in
the data archives or in the literature for a given parameter, this
is denoted with a “-” symbol in the relevant column. It is in-
structive to compare the coverage of the Nainital-Cape survey
with the currently established extent of the roAp phenomenon.
Therefore, the catalogue of the basic parameters of the known
roAp stars can be used for the statistical analysis of roAp and
noAp phenomena in Ap stars located in the same part of the H-
R diagram.

7. Evolutionary States of the Studied Samples

To establish the evolutionary status of the sample null result
stars, we ﬁrst established their luminosities and eﬀective temper-
atures, which then allowed us to compare them with the known
roAp stars. The absolute magnitudes and luminosities of the can-
didate stars observed in the Nainital-Cape survey were deter-
mined based on the data taken from the Hipparcos catalogue

(van Leeuwen 2007). The photometric Te f f is calculated from
the Str¨omgren β indices using the grids of Moon & Dworetsky
(1985) that give a typical error of about 200 K. The various
astrophysical parameters of the stars observed in the Nainital-
Cape survey are listed in Table 3. These parameters are either
taken from the Simbad database or calculated using the stan-
dard relations (Cox 1999). For each star, this Table lists the HD
number, right ascension α2000, declination δ2000, visual magni-
tude mv, spectral type, parallax π, Str¨omgren indices b − y, m1,
c1, β, δm1, δc1, eﬀective temperature Te f f , luminosity parame-
ter log ( L⋆
), duration of the observations ∆t, heliocentric Julian
L⊙
dates (HJD:2450000+) and year of observations (2000+) when
the star was observed. The Str¨omgren indices δm1 and δc1 are
calculated using the calibration of Crawford (1975, 1979).

The absolute magnitude Mv in the V-band was determined

using the standard relation (Cox 1999),

Mv = mv + 5 + 5 log π − Av,

(2)

where π is trigonometric parallax measured in arcsec, the inter-
stellar extinction in the V-band is AV = RVE(B-V)=3.1E(B-V).
The reddening parameter E(B-V) is obtained by taking the dif-
ference of the observed colour (taken from the Simbad data base)
and intrinsic colour (estimated from Cox (1999)).

The stellar luminosity was calculated using the relation

log

L
L⊙

= −

MV + BC − Mbol,⊙

2.5

,

(3)

where we adopted the solar bolometric magnitude Mbol,⊙ = 4.74
mag (Cox 1999), and used the standard bolometric correction
BC from Flower (1996). Taking into account all contributions
to the Mv and L⋆
error budgets, we ﬁnd a typical uncertainty of
L⊙
20-25% for both parameters.

The null objects displayed in Fig. 2 include all the objects
from paper I,II,III and IV (this paper) of the Nainital-Cape sur-
vey. The positions of known roAp stars and the newly discov-
ered δ-Scuti type variables in our survey are also shown. The
evolutionary tracks for stellar masses ranging from 1.5 to 3.0
M⊙ (Christensen-Dalsgaard 1993) are over-plotted. The position
of the blue (left) and red (right) edges of the instability strip are
shown by two oblique lines (Turcotte et al. 2000). Fig. 2 clearly
shows that most of the sample stars are located within the insta-
bility strip. For reasons given above, we may expect that some of
the stars listed as null results in this paper may well turn out to
be variables in near future. However, with each subsequent non-
detection of pulsations, the constraint on non-variability will be
strengthened and they will be established as “noAp” stars, thus
helping to shed light on the other observational characteristics
that will allow us to distinguish between pulsating and constant
CP stars, which is one of the long-term goals of the Nainital-
Cape survey.

8. Ground Based Surveys for Pulsation in

Chemically Peculiar stars

In the past, several surveys have been conducted around the
globe to search for roAp stars with diﬀerent instrumental set-
ups in both the northern and southern hemisphere independently.
Such surveys required much telescope time, hence the photomet-
ric surveys were performed on 1-m class telescopes, on which
it was possible to secure ample telescope time. Spectroscopic
surveys became more popular in recent years due to improved

6

S. Joshi et al.: The Nainital-Cape Survey-IV

Indian astronomers to increase the number of known roAp stars
in the northern sky. This survey was started in 1999 and lasted
for ten years making it the most extensive survey for pulsation
in CP stars, where a total of of 337 Ap and Am stars were moni-
tored. Although only one new roAp star, HD 12098, was discov-
ered, in this survey, it revealed milli-magnitude level light vari-
ations with periods similar to those of the δ-Scuti stars in seven
Am stars. This survey is thus unique in a sense that both the Ap
and Am stars were included in the samples, hence there were
plenty of chances to discover pulsations in CP1 and CP2 stars.
The null results of this survey have been published in Martinez
et al. (2001), Joshi et al. (2006, 2009) as well as in the present
paper. The archive of well-established null results is useful to
delineate the extent of the roAp phenomenon and also to shed
light on the distinction between roAp and noAp stars.

8.3. Lowell-WisconsinSurvey

Between 1985 to 1991, Nelson & Kreidl (1993) conducted a sur-
vey of pulsation in 120 northern Ap stars of spectral range B8–
F4. Though these authors did not report the discovery of any new
roAp stars from their survey, their main ﬁnding was the absence
of pulsation in the spectral range B8–A5, indicating that roAp-
like oscillations are likely to be conﬁned to the cooler peculiar
stars.

8.4. TheHvarSurvey

A photometric survey was initiated in 2011 to search for new
northern roAp stars at the Hvar observatory (Paunzen et al. 2012,
2015). For this survey, a CCD based photometer attached to the
1.0-m Austrian-Croatian telescope was used for the observations
of candidate stars. Under this survey, 80 candidate roAp stars
were examined for a total duration of 100 hours. Diﬀerential
CCD photometry was performed to detect the light variations
in the sample Ap stars. The authors have not reported any posi-
tive detections and have presented the frequency spectra and the
basic parameters of the null results they observed.

8.5. OtherMinorPhotometricSurveys

In addition to the above surveys, a number of smaller photo-
metric surveys have also been conducted in the northern and
southern hemisphere independently by Dorokhova & Dorokhov
(1998), Kurtz (1982), Matthews et al. (1988), Heller & Kramer
(1990), Schutt (1991), Belmonte (1989), Hildebrandt (1992),
and Handler & Paunzen (1999). Though these surveys are small
in terms of sample size and number of newly discovered roAp
stars, they have helped to deﬁne candidate selection criteria for
other roAp surveys.

8.6. SpectroscopicSurveys

Spectroscopy of high spectral and temporal resolution using
large telescopes allows the detailed study of line proﬁle varia-
tions (Hatzes & Mkrtichian 2005). After the discovery of sig-
niﬁcant RV pulsational variations in some known roAp stars
(Kanaan & Hatzes 1998), candidate roAp stars have been mon-
itored with time-resolved high-resolution spectroscopic obser-
vations by several observers in the last ten years. These obser-
vations have revealed that the highest RV amplitudes are ob-
served in the spectral lines of the rare-earth elements, while spec-
tral lines of the other elements show weak or undetectable os-

sensitivity of the high-resolution spectroscopic instruments used
to search for low-amplitude oscillations in roAp candidates. The
major drawback of this technique remains the small amount of
observing time available on large telescopes. In this section,we
provide a short description of the various surveys conducted for
pulsation in CP stars.

8.1. CapeSurvey

Following the discovery of ﬁrst roAp star HD 101065 in 1978,
only 14 stars were known prior to 1990. A systematic survey
for roAp stars in the southern hemisphere was initiated by Don
Kurtz and Peter Martinez at SAAO with two objectives: the ﬁrst
was to increase the number of members of this class and the sec-
ond was to study the relationship between the roAp stars and the
other pulsating stars located at the same region of the H-R di-
agram. The observations for this survey were acquired with the
photoelectric photometers attached to the 0.5-m and 1.0-m tele-
scopes at Sutherland. Under the Cape-survey 134 Southern Ap
SrCrEu stars were checked for the pulsational variability and 12
new roAp stars were discovered (Martinez et al. 1991, Martinez
& Kurtz 1994a, 1994b).

8.2. Nainital-CapeSurvey

The detection of the small amplitude light variations needs a
lot of observational expertise. As mentioned above most of the
roAp stars known prior to 2000 were discovered under the Cape
survey, where the SAAO astronomers gained a lot of observa-
tional experience. However, this meant that most of the known
roAp stars were southern objects. The Nainital-Cape survey was
initiated in 1999 as a collaboration between South African and

cillations. Using spectroscopic techniques, about 15 roAp stars
have been discovered (Kochukhov 2006; Kochukhov et al. 2008;
2009; Kochukhov et al. 2013; Alentive et al. 2012; Elkin et al.
2005a; 2005b; Kurtz et al. 2006).

9. Conclusions

In this paper, we have presented the light curves and frequency
spectra of the 108 candidate stars observed in the Nainital-Cape
survey. Analyses of the photometry acquired at Sutherland and
Nainital indicate that we have achieved a detection level of about
0.6 mmag in the frequency range 1-5 mHz in the Nainital-Cape
survey. Using the standard relations and data extracted from the
literature we have presented the various astrophysical parame-
ters of the null results. We have also compiled the basic physical
parameters of the known roAp stars. On comparing the positions
of the known roAp stars to the observed sample stars in the H-R
diagram, we infer that the boundary of the roAp phenomenon
extends beyond the cool edge of the classical instability strip.
