Abstract

We have investigated the upper bound of the radiation energy in the head-on collision of two Myers-Perry black holes.
Initially, the two black holes are far away from each other, and they become one black hole after the collision. We have
obtained the upper bound of the radiation energy thermodynamically allowed in the process. The upper bound of the
radiation energy is obtained in general dimensions. The radiation bound depends on the alignments of rotating axes for
a given initial condition due to spin-spin interaction. We have found that the collision may not be occurred for a initially
ultra-spinning black hole.

Introduction

Black holes play an important role in the strong gravitational ﬁeld. The merging of two black holes is one
possible mechanism by which observable gravitational waves are emitted in our universe. Recently, gravitational
waves were detected for the ﬁrst time by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) [1].
They originate from a binary black hole merging, with energy equivalent to three times of the solar mass.
Massive black holes may be important in studying the early universe related to the Higgs particle discovered at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [2, 3]. In the Higgs potential, the running of the coupling may imply that the
present universe is metastable, so that the universe decays into true vacua with certain lifetime. Compared with
the age of the universe, the decay lifetime can be long enough due to the large energy barrier [4–6]. However, the
energy barrier can be lowered by inhomogeneities reducing the decay lifetime up to millions of Planck times [7,8].
The black hole, a gravitational impurity, can generate such inhomogeneities.

The internal structure of a black hole including the singularity is covered by the horizon. Cosmic censorship
does not allow the naked singularity [9], so the horizon of the black hole should exist stable. Many black holes
have extremal bounds for their charges and angular momenta. After the black hole absorbs external ﬁelds or
particles, the cosmic censorship remains valid, if it still satisﬁes the extremal condition. The cosmic censorship
is known to be valid in Kerr black holes [10–16]. Although the cosmic censorship is invalid in near extremal
Reissner-Nordstr¨om (RN) black holes [17], it becomes valid when back-reaction is considered [18]. Cosmic
censorship is valid in many tests for Myers-Perry (MP) [19–23] and anti-de Sitter (AdS) [24–30] black holes.

The black hole is regarded as a thermodynamic system with Hawking temperature [31, 32]. The energy of
the black hole can be extracted through the Penrose process [33, 34], and the extracted energy is the rotational
energy of a Kerr black hole. However, even if the rotational energy can be decreased, the other constituents of
the black hole mass always increase; this is known as irreducible mass [35,36]. The irreducible mass is distributed
to the surface of the horizon [37], and the surface area of the horizon is proportional to the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy [38, 39] of the black hole. The laws of thermodynamics are constructed according to the deﬁnitions
of entropy and temperature in the black hole system. These laws are necessary to valid the theory of cosmic
censorship of Kerr and MP black holes [40].

An MP black hole, a higher-dimensional rotating black hole, is expected to be unstable at large angular
momentum. The 5-dimensional MP black hole with a single rotation has been found unstable by nonlinear
numerical evolution [41].
In higher dimensions, the angular momentum of the MP black hole may have no
upper bound. For example, the MP black hole with a single rotation can rapidly rotate. However, angular
momentum may have a critical value above which the MP black hole becomes unstable under perturbation [42–
44]. Instabilities are also found in multi-rotational or extremal cases [45–47]. Non-perturbative fragmentation
instability has also been found [48], which makes the black hole at a rapid angular velocity break into two black
holes. The fragmentation instability due to thermodynamic preference has been found in AdS black holes [49,50]
and also in dilatonic Gauss-Bonnet black holes [51].

Two rotating black holes radiate energy in their coalescing process. An upper bound for the radiation
energy has been found using the laws of thermodynamics [52]. The radiation energy depends on the alignment
of rotating axes of two black holes due to spin-spin interaction [53–55], which is approximately proportional to the
angular momentum of the black hole and equivalent to the energy upper bound for radiation [56]. The spinning
black hole binary can have large enough interaction to contribute to the black holes stability [57, 58], even at
higher dimensions [59]. Such interaction has been also studied for spinning particles in a curved spacetime [60,61].
The collision between two neutron stars is thermodynamically studied [62–64]. Detailed numerical analysis of
black hole collision has also been carried out. The basic framework was developed to study head-on collisions for
the Einstein gravitational ﬁeld equations [65–67]. The waveform of the gravitational radiation has been obtained
with consideration of the tidal heating of horizons in the head-on collision of two black holes [68–70]. Numerical

investigations were recently carried out to obtain the gravitational radiation for various initial conditions of
black holes [71–75].

In this paper, the radiation upper bound is investigated in relation to the collision of an MP black hole. We
generalize the Kerr black hole case [52,56] and obtain the bound for radiation energy that is thermodynamically
allowed in general dimensions, including four dimensions. We show that the radiation bound depends on the
alignments of rotating planes due to spin-spin interaction. Over ﬁve dimensions with a single rotation, the
collision of the two MP black holes cannot be occurred, if one of the black holes rotates rapid velocity. We
will interpret this phenomenon according to the instability and spin-spin interaction of the MP black hole. In
multi-rotations, the general behaviors of radiation bounds are shown for various initial conditions.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the MP black hole with multi-rotations. In
section 3, we introduce the basic framework and assumptions of the analytical method. Using the framework, we
obtain the radiation bounds for general dimensions in the numerical method. In section 4, we brieﬂy summarize
our results.

2 Myers-Perry Black Holes

The MP black hole is the generalization of the Kerr black hole to higher dimensions in Einstein gravity
[19]. The black hole solution is asymptotically ﬂat with multi-rotating planes in higher dimensions. The each
rotating plane is deﬁned by every two independent spatial dimensions. Including mass parameter µ and ith spin
parameter ai, the D-dimensional MP black hole metric is

dimensions is distinguished by an ǫ value of 1 for even and 0 for odd cases. Note that there is no rotation in the
last spatial direction for the even-dimension cases. The mass parameter µ and spin parameters ai are related

3 Myers-Perry Black Hole Collisions

We will investigate the upper bounds of radiation energy released after the collision of two MP black hole.
We generalize the Kerr black hole case [52,56] to that of the MP black hole. There are two stationary MP black
holes far from each other in the initial state. We treat these black holes independently since their interactions
are negligible. The ﬁrst black hole is mass M1 and angular momenta J1i. The second black hole is M2 and J2i,
in which index i signiﬁes the ith rotating plane. The rotating planes of black holes are assumed to be aligned
parallel or anti-parallel. After the collision, the ﬁnal state is one MP black hole with mass Mf and angular
momenta Jf i. The collision is a natural process, so the entropy of the ﬁnal state should be larger than that of
the initial state. This is described in terms of the inequality for the sum of the horizon area between the initial
and ﬁnal states,

AH (M1, J1i) + AH (M2, J2i) ≤ AH (Mf , Jf i) .

(6)

The entropy of radiation is ignored, because the actual radiation is much less than total mass of the initial state.
In head-on collision, the angular momentum is conserved since it cannot be radiated away.

J1i + J2i = Jf i ,

i = 1, 2, ..., n − ǫ .

(7)

The mass range of the ﬁnal black hole can be obtained in combination with Eq. (6) and (7). The loss of the
mass at the ﬁnal black hole can be released by the radiation. The radiation energy Mrad is

Mrad = M1 + M2 − Mf ,

(8)

where the mass Mf is a solution of inequality. So the maximum value of the radiation energy Mrad occurs at
the minimum value of the mass Mf , which will saturate the inequality in Eq. (6). Note that the maximum
value of the radiation is the thermodynamically allowed upper bound. We can rewrite the Eq. (6) and (7)

µ1r1 + µ2r2 ≤ µf rf , µ1a1i + µ2a2i = µf af i ,

i = 1, 2, ..., n − ǫ .

(9)

where the horizons of the black holes are r1, r2, and rf . To describe the radiation energy simply as the same
dimensionality of the mass parameter, the radiation energy is redeﬁned as µrad

µrad = µ1 + µ2 − µf ,

(10)

which is rewritten from Eq. (8). Technically, the bound of the radiation energy µrad can be obtained by solving
(n − ǫ + 1) equations in Eq. (9) saturating the inequality.

The radiation energy generally depends on the initial alignment of the black holes. In the approximation
for the small and slowly rotating second black hole with a single rotation, the derivative of radiation µrad with
respect to a2 is from Eq. (9)

(11)

When the black holes rotate parallel, the radiation decreases. However, the radiation increases for anti-parallel
rotation. This means that anti-parallel rotating black holes are more stable than parallel rotating cases. In other
words, black holes eﬀectively attract each other in anti-parallel rotation, but they repulse each other in parallel
rotation. This corresponds to the spin-spin interaction between spinning black holes [56]. Many interesting
behaviors can be expected from solving Eq. (9). The detailed analysis is shown numerically in the following
sections. Note that the parameters will be scaled by µ1 to dimensionless coordinates for the numerical analysis.

Equivalently, the mass parameter of the ﬁrst black hole can be set to unity. We will omit tildes for simplicity.

3.1 Radiation Bounds in Four and Five Dimensions

The MP black hole metric in four-dimensional spacetime is that of the Kerr black hole. The radiation
bounds are saturated the inequality in Eq. (8), so actual radiation is under the bound [52]. Now, we use the
dimensionless parameters deﬁned in Eq. (12) in which the mass parameter of the ﬁrst black hole is set to
unity. The interaction between Kerr black holes depends on the alignment of rotating axes, which is interpreted
as attraction and repulsion [56]. The radiation bound depends on the alignment of initial black holes. The
radiation bounds of anti-parallel cases are larger than those of parallel cases, as shown in Fig. 1. The radiation

bounds increase when the diﬀerence of the rotating velocities become larger, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Anti-parallel
alignment radiates more energy than is radiated in parallel cases because the radiation slope is negative for spin
parameter a2 in Eq. (11). The minimum points appear in parallel alignment. The minimum moves to a positive
direction with respect to a2 for larger values of a1. The radiation bound increases along with the second black
hole mass µ2, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The bounds for angular momentum restrict the range of the lines. The

radiation bounds are still larger in anti-parallel rotations because the interaction energy in attraction is released
in the collisions.

The radiation bounds in ﬁve-dimensional MP black holes behave similarly to those of four-dimensional Kerr
black holes, but two angular momenta are possible in ﬁve dimensions because there are four spatial dimensions
to be deﬁned in the two rotating planes. In addition, the angular momenta have Kerr bounds. Our analysis
is provided within these bounds. As shown in Fig. 2, The general behaviors of the radiation with respect to
a2 and µ2 are similar to those of four-dimensional cases. Anti-parallel black holes radiate more energy than
parallel black holes. The radiation bounds increase along with the mass parameter µ2 of the second black hole.
However, as shown in Fig. 2 (a), the volumes of the radiation bounds are smaller than those of four-dimensional
cases. This change can be also observed in Fig. 2 (b), in which the largest energy bound is emitted for anti-
parallel rotations and the smallest energy in parallel cases. The energy diﬀerence between anti-parallel and
parallel alignments becomes smaller than that of four-dimensional cases, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Compared with
four-dimensional MP black holes, the power of the gravitational force increases, so that more energy can be
captured by the gravity of the black hole. This is probably the reason for the energy decrease in ﬁve-dimensional
spacetime.

holes are µ2 = 1 and a11 = a12 = 0.2.

(b) The radiation bounds with respect to a12. The black

Figure 3: The radiation bounds for the collisions of 5-dimensional MP black hole with two rotations.

Turned on the second angular momenta, a12 and a22, the radiation bounds are changed in the ﬁve-dimensional
MP black hole as shown in Fig. 3. General shapes for variables, a12 and a22, are similar to a single rotation in
ﬁve-dimensional black holes, but these show that the radiation contribution of angular momenta is not linear.
Because the positive spin parameters are used, the minimum bound of the radiation in Fig. 3 appears with these
parameters. The radiation increases with large spin parameter a22, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). However, the eﬀects
with respect to spin parameter a12 are diﬀerent from those of a22, as shown in Fig. 3 (b).

3.2 Radiation for a Single Rotation over Five Dimensions

Over ﬁve dimensions, the MP black holes exhibit an explicit diﬀerence between single and multiple rotations.
For a single rotation, there is no Kerr bound. This makes it possible for the black hole to have an extremely large
spin parameter. If one of the initial black holes has large spin parameter with respect to its mass parameter,
the ﬁnal black hole can rapidly rotate. This can make that the entropy of the initial state is larger than that of

The initial state is thermodynamically preferred, so the collision of two black holes may not be occurred in the
higher-dimensional cases. The radiation bounds are numerically obtained as shown in Fig. 4. The radiation

hole is µ2 = 0.5. The radiation energy is zero at the black
points as following ﬁgures.

(b) The radiation bounds with respect to µ2. The black

Figure 4: The radiation bounds for the collision of 6-dimensional MP black holes with a single rotation.

bounds are shown for 6-dimensional cases with respect to a2 as shown in Fig. 4 (a). An anti-parallel alignment
emits more energy than a parallel case. For ﬁxed a2, the radiation bound increases with the diﬀerence of
the rotating velocities between the initial black holes. There are two maxima. One appears in anti-parallel
alignment, while the other appears in parallel alignment. The maximum in the anti-parallel case is the largest
radiation energy because more interaction energy is released in anti-parallel cases than in parallel ones. The
minimum is located in parallel alignments between the two maxima. For large spin parameters, the radiation
energy decreases to eventually reach zero at the black points as shown in Fig. 4 (a). For spin parameters beyond
black points, the entropy of the initial state is larger than that of the ﬁnal state. The MP black holes are
thermodynamically preferred to stay in the initial states. This is not observed in four and ﬁve dimensions. The
radiation continuously increases with respect to mass parameter µ2, as shown in Fig. 4 (b). The anti-parallel
cases emit more energy than parallel cases, as anticipated from Fig. 2 (b) and 3 (b). The radiation bounds start
at the black points, because the rapid spinning black hole is not thermodynamically preferred to collision. That
can be interpreted as demonstrating there are no coalesces in large spin parameters. The phenomena of zero
radiation can be related to repulsion in the spin-spin interaction. The interaction is approximately proportional
to the spin parameter of the black holes. Therefore, without an angular momentum bound, extremely strong
repulsion may be possible for large spin parameter a1 or a2. The strong repulsion with a large spin parameter
interrupts the black hole collisions.

The phenomena of no radiation at the large spin parameter suggest that two black holes may not be merged
by the collision. If we assume that the ﬁnal black hole is formed, then this black hole should be unstable. In
other words, the ﬁnal black hole should be fragmented into two initial black holes. According to fragmentation
instability [48, 49], the MP black hole can be unstable beyond critical spin parameters for given dimensions.
Critical spin parameters, ac, are

mass and spin parameters, the radiation bounds have smaller maxima and wider spin parameter ranges in higher
dimensions. In addition, the MP black holes can be thermodynamically preferred for the initial states over ﬁve
dimensions. This can be interpreted that if the black hole of the ﬁnal state is unstable due to fragmentation
instability. To illustrate this interpretation, we test whether the ﬁnal black hole can undergo fragmentation
instability. All spin parameters of no radiation are beyond the critical spin parameters as shown in Fig. 5 (b).
The phenomena of no radiation appear at each black point, and fragmentation instability occurs over each
horizontal line. Therefore, the ﬁnal state can be unstable if one of the initial black holes is rapidly spinning.
More energy is needed to form the unstable ﬁnal black hole, and then the radiation energy decreases to zero.

3.3 Radiation for Multi-Rotations over Five Dimensions

Multi-rotating MP black holes have angular momentum bounds for each rotating plane over ﬁve dimensions.
This is diﬀerent from single-rotation cases. Due to Kerr bounds for angular momenta, the ranges of the radiations

are also bounded. At wide angular bounds, the radiation bounds are similar to those of a single rotation, but the
shapes of the bounds become similar to those of ﬁve-dimensional cases, as shown in Fig. 6. The second rotating
plane is turned on in Fig. 6 (a) from Fig. 4 (a). There is still a zero radiation point in positive a21 because the
spin-spin repulsion is stronger in parallel cases. For the smaller range, the zero radiation range disappears in
Fig. 4 (b). Finally, the radiation bound becomes similar to those of ﬁve-dimensional cases in Fig. 4 (c). This

behavior is commonly observed over ﬁve-dimensional spacetimes with multi-rotations. Note that the eﬀect of
turned on spin parameters a12 and a22 is very small, so the lines in Fig. 6 almost overlap. The radiation bounds
increase along with the mass parameter µ2, as shown in Fig. 7 (a).
In the larger mass, the spin parameter
ranges are wider, so the lines are longer for large mass parameters. The radiation strengths decrease for higher
dimensions, as shown in Fig. 7 (b). In higher dimensions, the power of the gravitational force increases, so the
radiation bounds decrease.

4 Summary and Conclusion

We have investigated the radiation bound in the collision of two MP black holes. We assume that in the
initial state, the two stationary black holes are far away from each other, and then they collide head-on. In
the ﬁnal state, they will form one MP black hole with some energy loss by radiation. In this process, we have
obtained the thermodynamic radiation bounds by comparing the entropies between initial and ﬁnal states.

The radiations in anti-parallel alignment are expected to be larger than those in parallel cases as can be
seen in Eq. (11). That is related to the spin-spin interaction, attraction at anti-parallel and repulsion at parallel
alignment. There exists some qualitative diﬀerence depending on whether the spacetime dimension is larger
than ﬁve or not. In four and ﬁve dimensions, the radiation bounds become larger in anti-parallel alignments,
and the radiation minimum appeared in parallel cases. This result comes from the release of the interaction
energy. The radiation energy is also proportional to the mass parameters of the black holes.

In cases with more than ﬁve dimensions and a single rotation, there are two maxima in the radiation
energy with respect to the spin parameter. The overall radiations are large in the anti-parallel alignment.
However, for large spin parameters, the radiation bounds decrease to zero. This implies that the initial state is
thermodynamically preferred rather than the collision. This result comes from the lack of bounds for angular
momentum of the black holes. The spin-spin interaction increases with spinning velocity, so repulsion is expected

8

to be too strong for the two black holes to collide. Otherwise, this behavior can be interpreted as the instability
of the black hole. We considered fragmentation instability.
If one of the initial black holes has large spin
parameter, the ﬁnal black hole has been unstable under the fragmentation. Therefore, the formation of the
unstable ﬁnal black hole deceases the radiation energy to zero.

In cases with more than ﬁve dimensions and a multi-rotation, the bounds of angular momenta are evident.
The radiation behaviors are similar those in single-rotation cases in small second spin parameters, and the
behaviors become identical to those of four and ﬁve dimension cases with large second spin parameters. In
addition, the overall radiation decreases for higher dimensions.
