Abstract—Caching contents at the network edge is an efﬁcient
mean for ofﬂoading trafﬁc, reducing latency and improving
users’ quality-of-experience. In this letter, we focus on aspects of
storage-bandwidth tradeoffs in which small cell base stations are
distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process
and cache contents according to a given content popularity
distribution, subject to storage constraints. We provide a closed-
form expression of the cache-miss probability, deﬁned as the
probability of not satisfying users requests over a given coverage
area, as a function of signal-to-interference ratio, cache size, base
stations density and content popularity. In particular, it is shown
that for a given minimum cache size, the popularity based caching
strategy achieves lower outage probability for a given base station
density compared to uniform caching. Furthermore, we show that
popularity based caching attains better performance in terms of
cache-miss probability for the same amount of spectrum.

I. INTRODUCTION

Heterogeneous wireless networks, comprising of small cell
base stations (SBSs) underlying the macrocellular network,
is a promising solution to improve capacity, coverage and
users’ quality-of-experience (QoE) [1]. At the same time, the
unplanned deployment of dense small cells further renders
these problems very challenging [2] [3]. Recently, content
caching at the network edge (i.e., SBSs, user devices etc.)
has been proposed as a cost-efﬁcient solution to ofﬂoad cellu-
lar/backhaul trafﬁc, while satisfying users’ QoE and alleviating
network congestion [4] [5]. Although content caching and
spectrum sharing received signiﬁcant attention in recent years,
most of the existing works consider spectrum allocation and
caching separately, and little work has been done in exploring
their joint beneﬁts. In this respect, [6] proposes a collaborative
caching mechanism for wireless multimedia streaming exploit-
ing storage and bandwidth auctions. However, the distribution
of caches is considered ﬁxed. Meanwhile, [7] studies the
gains of caching in a stochastically distributed small cell
scenario, where the effects of storage size and ﬁle popularity
are investigated. Furthermore, the work in [8] characterizes the
outage probability in small cell networks for uniform content
distribution. However, the impact of spectrum has not been
addressed in [7] [8].

Unlike [8], this letter characterizes the outage probability in
serving user requests over a coverage area by jointly exploiting
spectrum and caching. By considering the distribution of
macro cellular base stations (MBSs) (with large cache) and
SBSs (with limited cache) as Poisson point processes (PPPs),
we derive a closed form expression of the outage probability

for a given content distribution. The outage probability is
deﬁned as the probability of not satisfying users requests over
a given coverage area, as a function of signal-to-interference
ratio (SIR), cache size and SBSs density. We emphasize that
the proposed model is pessimistic in the sense that it provides
a lower bound on the overall network performance and focuses
on the regime with large SBS density. For spectrum allocation,
we deﬁne the spectrum access factor as a measure of spectrum
accessed by the SBSs. We also show the interplay of caching
and spectrum sharing in such heterogeneous networks, draw-
ing insights on the tradeoff between cache size and spectrum
access factor, for different content popularity models.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

Consider the downlink transmission of a two-tier cellular
network comprising of SBSs, underlying MBSs in a two-
dimensional Euclidean plane R2 as shown in Fig. 1. Hereafter,
we will use the subscripts “SBS” and “MBS” to refer to
the system variables associated to the small- and macro-base-
stations, respectively. We assume that MBSs are deployed
according to a homogeneous PPP, ΦMBS = {Xi} with
intensity λMBS (MBSs per square meter), where Xi represents
the spatial location of the i-th MBS (in relation to the origin).
Similarly, SBSs distribution is modeled as a homogeneous
PPP, ΦSBS = {Yj}, with intensity λSBS (SBSs per square
meter), such that λSBS ≫ λMBS and Yj denotes the spatial
location of the j-th SBS. We consider a spectrum conﬁguration
where the bandwidth W is divided into B equal sub-channels
and each SBS randomly (and independently) accesses βB sub-
channels, such that β ∈ [0, 1]. Hereafter, β is referred to as
spectrum access factor. The transmit power of MBS and SBS
and pSBS = pmaxSBS
is represented by pMBS = pmaxMBS
βB ,
respectively where pmaxMBS and pmaxSBS is the maximum
transmit power of MBS and SBS, respectively.

B

Let each MBS be equipped with a large storage to cache
contents from a given library C = {1, 2, ..., |C|}, with size |C|.
All library contents are of equal size (in bits). Each SBS, in
turn, is equipped with a cache storage of size d and stores
a subset of library contents. For simplicity, we express the
cache size in terms of normalized cache size where ˜d = d/|C|.
Let Ωj ⊆ C represent the speciﬁc content(s) cached at the j-
th SBS. We assume that SBSs cache contents following two
different policies: a uniform caching policy (UCP), where the
SBSs randomly caches contents regardless of their popularity,
or popularity-based caching policy (PCP), where the SBSs
hold the d most popular contents.

We assume that a reference user – a mobile user – is located
at the origin o and analyze the system performance for the
reference link assuming it requests a given content c indepen-
dently at each time slot. We analyze two different distribution

considers the content distribution in a static network where
a single network realization considers ΦMBS, ΦSBS and Ωj
independently.

A. Cache Hit Probability

In order to deﬁne the cache hit probability, we ﬁrst introduce
a content replication Pc deﬁned as the probability that content
c is cached (replicated) at the SBS, expressed as:

Pc = P(cid:18)c ∈ Ωj(cid:19),

(4)

where c is ordered by the content popularity (i.e. c = 1 is
the most popular content, c = 2 the second most popular and
so on). As mentioned earlier, SBSs employ two replication
strategies, namely UCP and PCP. For UCP, Pc is the fraction
of library contents stored by SBS (i.e., Pc = d/|C|). For PCP,
the SBSs cache d most popular contents. In this case, Pc is
given by:

Pc =(1

0

c ≤ d
otherwise

.

(5)

User requests, represented by qc, are modeled as uniform or
Zipf distribution. While in the former user randomly requests
library contents, the latter considers different ﬁle popularity.
For the Zipf distribution, content requests are ranked from the
most popular to the least such that the request for a content
c ∈ C is:

qc =

.

(6)

cδ(cid:18)

|C|

Xi=1

iδ(cid:19)−1

Note that δ models the skewness of the popularity proﬁle. For
δ = 0 the popularity proﬁle is uniform over ﬁles, and becomes
more skewed as δ grows larger 1.

Based on content replication, the cache hit probability is
deﬁned as the probability of existence of the content within
RSBS or RMBS. Therefore, for a given reference user, the
existence of the closest SBS within RSBS is given by:

PSBS(c) = 1 − P(∄ SBS with c within RSBS)

(7)
For the MBSs, we proceed in a similar way, but considering

= 1 − e−βBλSBSPcπ(RSBS)2

.

that they have all contents in their library. Then,
PMBS = 1 − P(∄ MBS within RMBS)

= 1 − e−λMBSπ(RMBS)2

By considering the fact

the reference user always
associates to the closest SBS having the requested content, the
probability density function fc,SBS(r) of the distance R = r,
given that the content c exists within RSBS, is [10]:

of users’ requests: (i) uniform, where the contents are equally
popular, and (ii) Zipf where the contents’ popularity follows
a power-law distribution [9, Sec. IV-C].

We deﬁne a threshold distance RMBS and RSBS that spec-
iﬁes the maximum distance over which the MBS and SBS
serves the user’s content request respectively. The reference
user is associated to the nearest SBS with the cached content
within RSBS. If no SBS has cached the requested content,
MBSs may fulﬁll the user request. In this scenario, the user at-
tempts to associate to the nearest MBS within RMBS such that
RMBS > RSBS. At each transmission, we assume a standard
power loss propagation model with path loss exponent α > 2.
The multi-path effects are modeled as Rayleigh fading whose
gains ho are exponentially distributed with mean ho ∼ exp(1).
Furthermore, we assume an interference-limited regime and
therefore, neglect the effects of Additive White Gaussian Noise
(AWGN). Then, the SIR is computed as:

SIRo,z =

pzho,zR−α

Io,z

, z ∈ {SBS, MBS},

(1)

where pz is the transmit power of z, Rz is the (random)
distance of the reference link and Io,z is the interference
experienced by the reference user. The interference Io,z at
the reference user is the interference from all the MBSs and
SBSs transmitting on the same frequency. As the interference
from SBSs is a thinned PPP, ˜ΦSBS with density βλSBS, then
the interference experienced by the reference user served by
an SBS and MBS respectively is given by:

B. Outage Probability

Let TSBS(c) be the event that the requested content c has
been transmitted successfully given that c has been cached by a
SBS within RSBS. Then, the outage probability of transmitting
content c over RSBS, denoted by Pout,SBS(c) is:

Pout,SBS(c) = 1 − P[TSBS(c)],

(11)

where,
for a given SIR threshold γ, P[TSBS(c)] =
P(SIRo,SBS(c) > γ). Note that, due to the association pro-
cedure, the SIR implicitly depends on the content requested.
For the MBS, all the contents are cached and therefore the
outage probability is the same for all c ∈ C, given that there
exists at least one MBS within RMBS. In this case,

P[TMBS(c)] = P(SIRo,MBS > γ).

(12)
The probability that transmission is successful, conditioned
on the random variable R, representing the distance between
the reference user and the base-station associated with it, is:

ence user served by an MBS follows the same procedure as

Proof: Theorem 1 imply that if the content has been
the outage probability of
cached by a SBS within RSBS,
serving the user request is given by (17). Otherwise,
the
MBS within RMBS serves the reference user with the desired
content, given by (18). Therefore, the mean outage probability
is the linear combination of (17) and (18).

Meanwhile, the average outage probability is given by:

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We present here a numerical analysis of the outage prob-
ability, validating our analytical results with Monte-Carlo
simulations for a network grid of size 1000m × 1000m.
We generate 10, 000 requests from a library of size 100
according to the request distribution described in Sec. III-A.
For each request, the outage probability is evaluated over
2000 network realizations. In addition, we assume B = 1
while the maximum transmit powers of MBS and SBS are set
to 43dbm and 23dbm, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the outage
probability for various caching strategies as a function of
SBS density by considering uniform and Zipf content request
distributions. It can be clearly seen that the analytical results
match very well the simulation results, thus validating the
analytical expression. Without caching, increasing λSBS only
increases interference, resulting in an increased outage proba-
bility. When SBSs cache contents, the outage probability varies
with increasing λSBS depending on the content distribution.
For each of the content distribution, the outage probability

ﬁrst increases before levelling off. Under Zipf distribution, the
outage probability maximizes for smaller λSBS as SBSs only
cache the most popular contents. Under uniform distribution,
the outage probability is maximized for a relatively larger
λSBS, thus requiring more SBSs to fulﬁll user requests. In
addition, the cache hit probability given by (7) is an increasing
function of λSBS.

Fig. 3 shows the tradeoff between cache size and band-
width for different content distributions. In case of UCP, the
maximum outage probability is 0.2 for a large cache size.
For a decreasing cache size, the outage probability increases
under uniform distribution. However, for PCP,
the outage
probability increases much slower as SBSs cache the most
popular contents. Meanwhile, for PCP, the maximum outage
probability is 0.46 albeit utilizing the whole spectrum (β = 1)
while uniform caching attains the maximum outage probability
of 0.5. Therefore, caching smartly requires less amount of
spectrum to achieve the same cache hit probability. Hence,
PCP makes use of the network resources more efﬁciently for
a constrained cache size. Furthermore, PCP is preferred for
a ﬁxed bandwidth as it achieves the minimum outage prob-
ability. Finally, Fig. 4 shows the impact of SIR threshold on
outage probability, showing that PCP relaxes the SIR threshold
requirement for a given outage probability. Furthermore, spec-

probability than the joint cache-spectrum allocation.

V. CONCLUSION

In this letter, we examined a cache-enabled small cell
network underlying the macro cellular network, in which SBSs
strategically store contents. By considering the distribution of
SBSs to be a PPP, we analytically derived the outage proba-
bility of serving the requested content by jointly considering
spectrum allocation and storage constraints. In addition, we
characterized the number of SBSs required to satisfy a given
cache hit probability for different content distributions. This
letter highlights the key tradeoff between cache size, node
density and spectrum, underscoring the fact that larger cache
size can be leveraged in conjunction with smaller spectrum
access factor.
