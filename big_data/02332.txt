ABSTRACT

Context. Our poor understanding of the boundaries of convective cores generates large uncertainties on the extent of
these cores and thus on stellar ages. The detection and precise characterization of solar-like oscillations in hundreds of
main-sequence stars by CoRoT and Kepler has given the opportunity to revisit this problem.
Aims. Our aim is to use asteroseismology to consistently measure the extent of convective cores in a sample of main-
sequence stars whose masses lie around the mass-limit for having a convective core.
Methods. We ﬁrst test and validate a seismic diagnostic that was proposed to probe in a model-dependent way the
extent of convective cores using the so-called r010 ratios, which are built with l = 0 and l = 1 modes. We apply this
procedure to 24 low-mass stars chosen among Kepler targets to optimize the eﬃciency of this diagnostic. For this
purpose, we compute grids of stellar models with both the Cesam2k and MESA evolution codes, where the extensions
of convective cores are modeled either by an instantaneous mixing or as a diﬀusion process.
Results. We ﬁnd that 10 stars or our sample are in fact subgiants. Among the other targets, we are able to unambiguously
detect convective cores in eight stars and we obtain seismic measurements of the extent of the mixed core in these targets
with a good agreement between the Cesam2k and MESA codes. By performing optimizations using the Levenberg-
Marquardt algorithm, we then obtain estimates of the amount of extra-mixing beyond the core that is required in
Cesam2k to reproduce seismic observations for these eight stars and we show that this can be used to propose a
calibration of this quantity. This calibration depends on the prescription chosen for the extra-mixing, but we ﬁnd that
it should be valid also for the code MESA, provided the same prescription is used.
Conclusions. This study constitutes a ﬁrst step towards the calibration of the extension of convective cores in low-mass
stars, which will help reduce the uncertainties on the ages of these stars.

1. Introduction

The extent of chemically mixed regions associated to stellar
convective cores is notoriously uncertain. Several physical
processes that remain challenging to describe theoretically
are known to extend convective cores beyond the theoretical
Schwarzschild limit. The most often cited among them is
core overshooting. According to Schwarzschild’s criterion,
the boundary of a convective core corresponds to the layer
above which upward-moving convective blobs are braked.
However, this criterion neglects the inertia of the ascend-
ing blobs, which are expected to penetrate over a certain

distance (overshoot) inside the radiative zone. The the-
oretical complexity of this phenomenon is well illustrated
by the large number of developments that were proposed
to describe it (e.g. Saslaw & Schwarzschild 1965, Shaviv
& Salpeter 1971, Roxburgh 1978, Zahn 1991 to quote only
a few) and by the diversity of the predicted distances dov
over which convective eddies are expected to overshoot in
the stable region (predicted values for dov range from 0 to
2 HP , where HP is the local pressure scale height). Cur-
rent numerical simulations of overshooting are encourag-
ing, but they are still far from reproducing the very high
turbulence of stellar convection and cannot yet be used to
obtain reliable prescriptions for core overshooting (see Din-
trans 2009 for a review). Another complication arises from

Article number, page 1 of 27

the fact that convective cores can also be extended due
to rotationally-induced mixing (see Maeder 2009 and ref-
erences therein). As a result, it is still an open issue to
determine (1) over which distance convective cores are ex-
tended, (2) what the temperature stratiﬁcation is like in
these core extensions, and (3) how chemical elements are
mixed in these regions.

Since convective cores constitute reservoirs for nuclear
reactions, the uncertainty on their sizes generates signiﬁ-
cant uncertainties on stellar ages, especially near the end
of the main sequence (MS). Lebreton et al. (2014) for in-
stance estimated that an extension of convective cores over
a typical distance of 0.2 HP can generate errors on stel-
lar ages as large as 30% at the turnoﬀ. It also aﬀects the
isochrones that have turnoﬀ masses above ∼ 1.1M⊙, and
thus the age of rather young clusters.

To account for the combined eﬀects of core overshoot-
ing and rotational mixing, 1D stellar models often consider
an ad-hoc extra mixing at the edge of the convective core,
which is either modeled as an instantaneous mixing (sim-
ple extension of the mixed core) or as a diﬀusion process
(Ventura et al. 1998), i.e. as a non-instantaneous mixing
(see Noels et al. 2010 for a review). In both cases, the ex-
tent of the extra-mixing (usually known as the overshooting
distance dov even though overshooting may not be the only
mechanism at work) depends on one free parameter. These
models are clearly overly simplistic but current observations
have not yet permitted to constrain more complex models.
The overshooting distance has been observationally con-
strained by ﬁtting isochrones to the color-magnitude dia-
grams of open clusters (e.g. Maeder & Mermilliod 1981,
VandenBerg et al. 2006) and by performing calibrations
using eclipsing binaries (e.g. Claret 2007, Stancliﬀe et al.
2015). These studies typically pointed toward an instan-
taneous mixing over a distance dov ∼ 0.2HP (where HP
is the local pressure scale height) with rather large star-
to-star variations. The case of low-mass stars (typically
M . 1.5 M⊙) is known to be problematic within this for-
malism. Indeed, for stars with small convective cores the
overshooting region becomes unrealistically large because
HP (r) → ∞ when r goes to zero. This prompted several
authors to consider an overshoot parameter αov that in-
creases with stellar mass in the approximate mass range
1.1M⊙ . M . 1.5M⊙ (e.g. Pietrinferni et al. 2004, Bres-
san et al. 2012). In these cases, an ad-hoc linear increase
of αov as a function of M was chosen, with some success
in reproducing the turnoﬀ of clusters with turnoﬀ-masses
around 1.3 M⊙ (Pietrinferni et al. 2004). The problem re-
mains however poorly constrained in this range of mass,
and the use of eclipsing binary systems for this purpose is
unfortunately of little help (Valle et al. 2016).

Recently, constraints on the extent of the extra mixing
beyond convective cores has been obtained from asteroseis-
mology. Sharp variations in the mean molecular weight
proﬁle at the boundary of the mixed core create a glitch to
which oscillation modes are sensitive, which can be used to
measure the extent of the mixed region associated to con-
vective cores. This approach has been successfully applied
to solar-like pulsators in the main sequence (Deheuvels et al.
2010b, Goupil et al. 2011, Silva Aguirre et al. 2013, Guen-
ther et al. 2014, Appourchaux et al. 2015), in the subgiant
phase (Deheuvels & Michel 2010, 2011) and to several main-
sequence B stars (e.g. Degroote et al. 2010, Neiner et al.
2012, Moravveji et al. 2015). All these studies reported

the need for extended convective cores and conﬁrmed the
great potential of asteroseismology to measure this exten-
sion. However, we are still lacking consistent seismic studies
of larger samples of stars, which are needed to better un-
derstand how the overshooting distance varies with stellar
parameters.

In this paper, we took advantage of the detection of
solar-like oscillations in hundreds of solar-like pulsators
with an unprecedented level of precision by the space mis-
sion Kepler (Borucki et al. 2010) to consistently measure
the extent of the convective core in a larger sample of stars.
We have focused on stars whose masses lie around the mass-
limit for having a convective core (M & 1.1M⊙ at solar
metallicity). For these stars, a large part of the core lu-
minosity comes from the burning of 3He outside of equi-
librium. Core overshooting can considerably increase the
abundance of 3He in the core, and therefore also the core
luminosity, size, and lifetime (Roxburgh 1985, Deheuvels
et al. 2010b). For instance an instantaneous overshooting
over a distance of 0.1 HP in a 1.3-M⊙ star generates an
increase of as much as 50% in the convective core radius
during the main sequence1. As a consequence, these stars
are particularly good tracers of the existence and amount
of core overshooting.

It has been shown in previous studies that the small
separations built with l = 0 and l = 1 modes are partic-
ularly sensitive to the structure of the core (Provost et al.
2005, Deheuvels et al. 2010b, Silva Aguirre et al. 2011), and
that their ratios r010 to the large separations are nearly in-
sensitive to the so-called near-surface eﬀects (Roxburgh &
Vorontsov 2003). In Sect. 2, we show that this diagnostic
can be used to obtain a model-dependent estimate of the
extent of the mixed core by building a grid of models with
the evolution code Cesam2k (Morel & Lebreton 2008). We
then select a subsample of 24 solar-like pulsators among Ke-
pler targets that are the most likely to provide constraints
on the amount of core overshooting based on the results of
our grid of models, and we extract their mode frequencies
from their oscillation spectra in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we con-
front the observed ratios r010 to those of two grids of models
computed with Cesam2k and MESA (Paxton et al. 2011).
We consistently detect convective cores in eight of the se-
lected targets and we obtain measurements of the extent
of the mixed core in these stars.
In Sect. 5 we discuss
the diﬀerent existing prescriptions for core overshooting in
low-mass stars, we show how our results can be used to
calibrate the prescription used in the code Cesam2k, and
we address the question whether such a calibration can be
adapted in MESA.

2. Estimating the core size with seismology

2.1. Asteroseismic diagnostics

A sharp gradient of the mean molecular weight µ builds up
at the boundary of the homogeneous convective core, which
induces rapid variations in the sound speed proﬁle, and even
makes it discontinuous in the case of a growing core without
microscopic diﬀusion. It is well known that such a glitch
in c(r) adds an oscillatory modulation to the expression

1 This is shown in Fig. 15 of this paper, but note that this
depends on the exact prescription that is adopted for core over-
shooting, as is discussed in Sect. 5.

S. Deheuvels et al.: Measuring the extent of convective cores in low-mass stars using Kepler data

of the mode frequencies as a function of the radial order.
The period of this modulation is directly related to the
depth of the glitch (Gough 1990). This is not speciﬁc to
the boundary of convective cores, and such acoustic glitches
can also be produced by the base of convective envelopes
or the helium ionization regions.

When the period of this oscillation is smaller than the
frequency range of the observed frequencies, the acoustic
depth of the glitch can be estimated in a model-independent
way. I has been recently shown that the depth of the sec-
ond helium ionization zone and the base of the convective
envelope can be estimated with such a diagnostic (Lebreton
& Goupil 2012, Mazumdar et al. 2014). Unfortunately, the
glitch caused by convective cores induces a longer-period
oscillation and only a fraction of the period can be ob-
served. This makes it much more diﬃcult to obtain model-
independent information about the boundary of convective
cores. Cunha & Brandão (2011) and Brandão et al. (2014)
showed that the amplitude of the sound speed discontinuity
at the core edge may be recovered in some favorable cases.
It is not clear whether a model-independent estimate of the
extent of the mixed core can be obtained.

However, it has been shown by several studies that a
model-dependent measurement of the core size can be ob-
tained through seismology. Combinations of mode frequen-
cies built with l = 0 and l = 1 modes are well suited for
this type of study because they are particularly sensitive
to the core structure (Provost et al. 2005, Deheuvels et al.
2010b). Roxburgh & Vorontsov (2003) advised to use the
ﬁve-point separations d01 and d10 deﬁned as

d01(n) =

1
8

d10(n) = −

(ν0,n−1 − 4ν1,n−1 + 6ν0,n − 4ν1,n + ν0,n+1) (1)

(ν1,n−1 − 4ν0,n + 6ν1,n − 4ν0,n+1 + ν1,n+1).

They showed that the ratios between these small separa-
tions and the large separations constructed as

r01(n) =

r10(n) =

∆ν1(n)

d10(n)

∆ν0(n + 1)

where ∆νl(n) = νl,n − νl,n−1 are largely insensitive to the
structure of the outer layers, which makes them almost im-
mune to the so-called near-surface eﬀects. These ratios, re-
ferred to as r010 when combined together, have been used
e.g. to estimate the depth of the convective envelope and
the second helium ionization zone in the Sun (Roxburgh
2009) or to establish the existence of a convective core in
a Kepler target (Silva Aguirre et al. 2013). We note that
Cunha & Metcalfe (2007) proposed to use a combination of
frequencies using modes of degrees up to 3 (dr0213), which
can interestingly be related to the intensity of the sound
speed jump at the edge of growing cores. However, l = 3
modes have low amplitudes in stars other than the Sun,
and although several detections of such modes have been
obtained (e.g. Deheuvels et al. 2010a, Metcalfe et al. 2010),
it remains exceptional to reliably estimate their frequencies
over several consecutive radial orders.
In this study, we
have tested and used the diagnostic based on the r010 ra-
tios.

Fig. 1: Variations in the ratio r010 around νmax as a func-
tion of frequency for models of 1.2 M⊙ from the ZAMS
(dark blue) to the beginning of the post main sequence
(dark red). The dashed lines correspond to ﬁts of 2nd order
polynomials.

Fig. 1 shows the behavior of the r010 ratios for a model
of 1.2 M⊙ evolved from the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS)
to the beginning of the subgiant phase. The ratios are rep-
resented only in the frequency range where modes are ex-
pected to be observed, i.e. over about 12 radial orders
around the frequency of maximum power of the oscillations
νmax. As mentioned above, only a fraction of the period of
the oscillation induced by the edge of the core can be ob-
served, and the r010 ratios can in fact be well approximated
by second-order polynomials throughout the MS, as can be
seen in Fig. 1.

Several studies have shown that the slope and mean
value of r010 ratios are a good indicator of the size of the
mixed core (Popielski & Dziembowski (2005), Deheuvels
et al. 2010b, Silva Aguirre et al. 2011). However, these pre-
vious studies either focused on a particular star or worked
with models that share the same physical properties other
than the mixing at the edge of the core. We know that
several other parameters, such as the abundance of heavy
elements, have a signiﬁcant impact on the size of the con-
vective core. We here aimed at testing the eﬃciency of this
diagnostic tool.

2.2. Testing the diagnostic of r010 ratios

2.2.1. Description of the grid

To determine in which circumstances the extent of the core
can be estimated with the r010 ratios, we computed a grid
of models using the stellar evolution code Cesam2k (Morel
& Lebreton 2008).

We used the OPAL 2005 equation of state and opacity
tables as described in Lebreton et al. (2008). The nuclear
reaction rates were computed using the NACRE compila-
tion (Angulo et al. 1999) except for the 14N (p, γ)15O reac-
tion where we adopted the revised LUNA rate (Formicola
et al. 2004). The atmosphere was described by Eddington’s
gray law. We assumed the classical solar mixture of heavy
elements of Asplund et al. (2009) (hereafter AGSS09). Con-

mixed modes appear around νmax, because these modes
cause brutal variations in the r010 ratios and prevent them
from being directly used as a diagnostic for the core size.

For each of the models along the evolutionary tracks,

we ﬁtted 2nd order polynomials of the type

P (ν) = a0 + a1(ν − β) + a2(ν − γ1)(ν − γ2)

(6)

to the r010 ratios. The parameters β, γ1, and γ2 were cho-
sen to ensure that P (ν) is a sum of orthogonal polynomials
for each model. The ﬁts were performed in the approximate
frequency range where modes are expected to be observed,
i.e. about 12 orders around the frequency of maximum
power of oscillations νmax. This latter frequency was esti-
mated for stellar models by assuming that it scales as the
acoustic cutoﬀ frequency. This assumption, which is the
basis of the so-called seismic scaling relations, was obser-
vationally veriﬁed to work at the level of a few percent at
least (Stello et al. 2008, Huber et al. 2011, Silva Aguirre
et al. 2012), and is gaining theoretical support (Belkacem
et al. 2011). We note that during most of the MS, the r010
ratios vary roughly linearly with frequency in the range of
observed frequencies, so that the coeﬃcient a2 of the ﬁt is
negligible.

2.2.2. Evolutionary tracks in the (a1, a0) plane

Before commenting on the results of the grid, we show as
an example the evolutionary tracks in the (a1, a0) plane
(slope versus mean value) of 1.2-M⊙ models for diﬀerent
amounts of core overshooting (Fig. 3a). For comparison,
the variations in the size of the convective core for the same
models are shown as a function of age in Fig. 3b. As
mentioned by Silva Aguirre et al. (2011), the trajectory of
models in the (a1, a0) plane depends in a complex way on
the evolutionary stage, the size of the convective core, and
the amplitude of the glitch in the sound speed. However,
we can still broadly understand it. At the beginning of
the MS, the stars with diﬀerent αov start roughly at the
same point in the (a1, a0) plane (bottom right corner in
Fig. 3a).
Indeed, the µ-gradient at the edge of the core
has not had time to build up yet, so the r010 ratios are still
nearly independent from the size of the convective core.
As the star evolves, the glitch in the sound speed proﬁle
builds up, which causes the amplitude of the oscillations of
the r010 ratios to increase. Therefore both the mean value
a0 and the absolute value of the slope |a1| of the ratios
increase. But also, as the star evolves, its νmax frequency
decreases. As a result, the range of observable frequencies
shifts to a diﬀerent part of the oscillation produced by the
glitch. As can be seen in Fig. 1, when stars reach the
end of the MS, the r010 ratios lie around a maximum of
this oscillation, which results in a decrease of the absolute
value of the slope |a1|. For post-main sequence stars, the
mean slope a1 even becomes positive. This explains why
the evolutionary tracks of models in the (a1, a0) plane are
vaguely circular, as can be seen in Fig. 3.

For models with larger amounts of overshooting, the
convective core is larger. Therefore, the period of the oscil-
lation caused by the glitch is shorter and the absolute mean
slope |a1| of the r010 ratios is larger. As a result, stars with
larger αov are shifted to the left in the (a1, a0) plane, and
they draw larger circles. This conﬁrms previous statements
that the position in the (a1, a0) plane is discriminant for the
size of the core if all parameters other than αov are ﬁxed.

Fig. 2: Variations in the pressure scale height HP (dashed
line) and the radius of the extended convective core Rc
(solid blue line) with age for a 1.3 M⊙ Cesam2k model
with solar metallicity, a solar-calibrated value for the mix-
ing length, Y0 = 0.26, and αov = 0.1. The gray solid line
indicates the Schwarzschild limit.

vection was treated using the Canuto-Goldman-Mazzitelli
(CGM) formalism (Canuto et al. 1996). This description in-
volves a free parameter, the mixing length, which is taken
as a fraction αCGM of the pressure scale height HP . We here
assumed a value of αCGM calibrated on the Sun (α⊙ = 0.64,
Samadi et al. 2006).

To account for the physical processes that could increase
the size of convective cores, we considered an instantaneous
mixing beyond convective cores over a distance dov taken
as a fraction αov of the pressure scale height HP . The
free parameter αov is as often referred to as the overshoot
parameter. In order to avoid the overshooting region from
unrealistically extending over a distance as large as the core
itself, Cesam2k models deﬁne the overshooting distance as

dov = αov × min(HP , rs)

(5)

where rs is the Schwarzschild limit of the core. We note that
this is the case during most of the main sequence for stars
with masses . 1.5M⊙, as shown by Fig. 2. We have im-
posed the adiabatic temperature gradient in the overshoot
region.

Microscopic diﬀusion is known to increase the abun-
dance in heavy elements in the core as the star evolves,
and thus to increase the size of convective cores. In this
section, microscopic diﬀusion is not included in the mod-
els so that the core extension imposed by the overshoot
parameter αov can be partly attributed to its eﬀects. The
contribution from microscopic diﬀusion is addressed in Sect.
4.

The grid was computed with masses ranging from 0.9 to
1.5 M⊙ (step 0.05 M⊙), metallicities from −0.4 to 0.4 dex
(step 0.1 dex), and two values of the initial helium abun-
dance (0.26 or 0.30). Models were computed for values
of αov ranging from 0 to 0.3 (step 0.05). For each evo-
lutionary sequence, the mode frequencies were computed
with the oscillation code losc (Scuﬂaire et al. 2008) for
about 60 models between the ZAMS and the beginning of
the subgiant phase. We stopped the evolution as soon as

indicate that the model has a convective (resp. radiative) core. Right: Variations in the size of the convective core as a

2.2.3. Results of the grid

When solar-like oscillations are detected in a star, it is usu-
ally straightforward to estimate the mean large separation
of its acoustic modes ∆ν. We thus chose to show the re-
sults of the grid at ﬁxed values of ∆ν. This time, each
evolutionary sequence of our grid is represented as a dot
in the (a1, a0) plane, provided its large separation matches
the chosen value of ∆ν at some point along the evolution.
Fig. 4 shows the location of the models in the (a1, a0)
plane for four values of ∆ν : 110, 95, 70, and 65 µHz. For
∆ν = 110 µHz (top left plot), there is a relative degeneracy
of the models in the (a1, a0) plane. This can be understood
because only low-mass unevolved stars reach such a high
value of ∆ν. Higher-mass stars begin the MS with a lower
∆ν, and this quantity further decreases as the star evolves2.
For this reason, few of the stars with ∆ν = 110 µHz have a
convective core. And those that have one are still close to
the ZAMS, so the µ-gradient has not had time to build up
yet and the r010 ratio still does not feel it. The diagnostic
is thus less eﬃcient for ∆ν & 110 µHz.

For lower values of ∆ν, diﬀerent populations are repre-
sented: (1) evolved low-mass stars (in the PoMS for the
lowest masses) and (2) MS higher-mass stars.
In these
cases, Fig. 4 clearly shows that the location of a model
in the (a1, a0) plane can be used to estimate:

– the evolutionary state: as mentioned before, when
stars leave the MS, the mean slope a1 of the ratios in-
creases and becomes positive. As a result, PoMS models
occupy a place in the (a1, a0) plane that is increasingly
distinct from that of MS models, as the large separa-
tion decreases. This opens the possibility to determine
the evolutionary status of a star from its location in the
(a1, a0) plane.

– the existence and the size of the convective core:
for stars with large separations below ∼ 95 µHz, models
with αov = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 occupy distinct regions
in the (a1, a0) plane, which suggests that it should be

ZAMS with ∆ν ∼ 110 µHz, so more massive stars never reach
this value.

possible to measure the size of the mixed core by using
the location of the star in this plane.

We stress that the eﬀects of metallicity on the size of the
core are here taken into account in a very conservative way,
since the models of Fig. 4 include a wide range of metal-
licities (−0.4 to 0.4 dex). In practice, the metallicity of an
observed star is usually known with a much better accu-
racy if spectroscopic measurements are available. We thus
conclude that the r010 ratios are in principle an eﬃcient
tool to measure the size of convective cores, provided the
observed star is evolved enough to have developed a glitch
in the sound speed at the edge of the core.

3. Extracting the r010 ratios from Kepler targets

3.1. Selection of targets

Based on the tests performed on stellar models in Sect. 2.2,
we established a set of criteria to select Kepler targets for
which the r010 ratios should provide a good diagnostic for
the core structure. We selected stars for which

– the mean large separation is below 110 µHz, so that the

diagnostic tool is eﬃcient

– no mixed modes are contaminating the r010 ratios
– a long enough data set is available, so that a good preci-
sion can be attained in the estimates of the parameters
ai. Even with 9 months of Kepler data, the r010 ra-
tios of a target studied by Silva Aguirre et al. (2013)
were contaminated by a spurious increase in the low-
signal-to-noise part of the spectrum. To avoid these
features that might bias our estimates of the ai param-
eters, we selected only stars that were observed for at
least 9 months.

– the observed modes are narrow enough: we excluded
F stars, whose modes are too wide to unambiguously
distinguish the l = 1 ridge from the l = 0 and l = 2
ridges in an échelle diagram. We note that Bayesian
methods have been proposed to identify the degree of
the modes and extract the mode frequencies even in
these cases (e.g. Benomar et al. 2009). However, this
type of analysis requires dedicated works, which can be

undertaken as an interesting follow-up of this work to
explore the sizes of convective cores in higher-mass stars.

We applied these criteria to the solar-like pulsators
whose global parameters were determined by Chaplin et al.
(2014) and obtained a list of 24 targets, which are given in
Table 1. Most of these stars were also observed spectro-
scopically from the ground, which yielded estimates of the
eﬀective temperature and of the surface metallicity. When
available, these measurements are speciﬁed in Table 1.

3.2. Extraction of the mode frequencies

The mode frequencies of 13 out of the 24 selected targets
were already extracted from Kepler observations by Ap-
pourchaux et al. (2012). However, this study was performed
with nine months of Kepler data, whereas at current time
almost three years of data are available in the most favor-
able cases. We thus decided to reanalyze all the targets of
the selected sample using the full Kepler data sets available
(until Q16) to date. For this purpose, we used a maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) method in the same way as
previously applied to CoRoT and Kepler targets (e.g. Ap-
pourchaux et al. 2008, Deheuvels et al. 2010b). For each
star, we adjusted Lorentzian proﬁles to all the modes simul-
taneously (global ﬁts). We here neglected the rotational
splitting of the modes and ﬁtted only one component for

Article number, page 6 of 27

each multiplet of degree l and radial order n. Since the
stars of the sample are expected to be slow rotators, the
rotational multiplets should be approximately symmetrical
with respect to their m = 0 component. As a result, we
expect negligible bias due to rotation in our estimates of
the mode frequencies. We stress that in this work, we were
only interested in estimating the ai parameters of a polyno-
mial ﬁt to the r010 ratios of the observed stars. As a result,
we did not seek to estimate the frequencies of lower signal-
to-noise modes around the edges of the frequency range of
observed modes. We obtained estimates of the mode pa-
rameters over 9 to 15 overtones for the 24 targets. The
results are given in Tables A.1 to A.6 in Appendix A. Our
results are in good agreement with those obtained by Ap-
pourchaux et al. (2012) for the targets that are among our
sample. We indeed found that 31% (resp. 8%, 3%) of the
ﬁtted mode frequencies agree within 1 (resp. 2, 3) σ with
the results of Appourchaux et al. (2012), which is close to
what is statistically expected.

We used the estimated mode frequencies to evaluate the
global seismic parameters of the selected targets. A linear
regression of the frequencies of l = 0 modes as a function of
the radial order n provided an estimate of the mean large
separation ∆ν. The obtained values are given in Table 1.
We then performed a gaussian ﬁt to the mode amplitudes as
a function of frequency. The central frequency of the ﬁtted
Gaussian provides an estimate of the frequency of maxi-

mum power of the oscillations νmax (see Table 1). Seismic
scaling relations were then used to relate the global seismic
parameters ∆ν and νmax, and the eﬀective temperature Teﬀ
to the stellar mass and radius. The underlying assumption
behind seismic scaling relations was already mentioned in
Sect. 2.2.1. Whenever it was available, we used the spectro-
scopic Teﬀ obtained by Bruntt et al. (2012). For the three
stars of the sample that were not observed by Bruntt et al.
(2012), we used a photometric estimate obtained from the
recipe proposed by Pinsonneault et al. (2012), which was
applied to the griz photometry available from the Kepler in-
put catalogue (KIC). We thus obtained stellar masses rang-
ing from 0.94 to 1.39 M⊙ (see Table 1). We note that for
all the stars for which both spectroscopic and photometric
estimates of Teﬀ were available, the agreement on the stellar
masses obtained with both sets of Teﬀ is excellent (below 1
σ for all stars except one at 1.7 σ).

3.3. Polynomial ﬁt to r010 ratios

We used the ﬁtted mode frequencies listed in Tables A.1
to A.6 in Appendix A to compute the r010 ratios of all the
stars of the sample. Two representative examples are shown
in Fig. 5. KIC6106415 (left plot) is still in a phase where
the r010 ratios are roughly linear in the range of observed
frequencies, while the ratios of KIC12258514 have a more
parabolic shape. As predicted by stellar models, we found
that the observed ratios are well reproduced by 2nd degree
polynomials. For several targets, the r010 ratios deviate
from a mere parabola because of a short-period oscillation
around the parabolic general trend. This is expected and
corresponds to the signature of the base of the convective

envelope. In this work, the polynomial ﬁt that we applied
to the r010 ratios ﬁlters out this contribution. This is to
our advantage here since we are merely interested in prob-
ing the core properties in this study. However, we stress
that these signatures of the bottom of the convective enve-
lope can potentially yield precious model-independent con-
straints on the stellar structure (Mazumdar et al. 2014) and
deserve further investigation. The dip in the proﬁle of the
adiabatic index Γ1 corresponding to the region of second
ionization of helium can also create a short-period oscilla-
tion in seismic indexes, however the r010 ratios are almost
insensitive to these shallow regions and the amplitude of
the corresponding oscillation is expected to be negligible.

To ﬁt polynomials to the observed r010 ratios, one needs
to take into account the high level of correlation between
the data points. Indeed, each mode frequency is used by
several data points. The covariance matrix between linear
combinations of the mode frequencies (e.g. between the d01
and d10 separations as deﬁned by Eq. 1 and 2) can easily
be computed analytically, but it is much harder for the r010
ratios because of the division by the large separations. We
therefore resorted to Monte Carlo simulations using the ob-
served mode frequencies and their associated error bars to
estimate the covariance matrix C for each star. This ap-
proach supposes that the errors in the mode frequency esti-
mates are normally distributed, which has been shown to be
a valid approximation (Benomar et al. 2009), except for low
signal-to-noise-ratio modes, which we have excluded here3.
The optimal parameters a0, a1, and a2 of the polynomial
described in Eq. 6 were then obtained by a least-square

minimization of the residuals weighted by the coeﬃcients
of the inverse W of the covariance matrix, as described in
Appendix B. This type of ﬁtting is now applied routinely to
ﬁt stellar models constrained by combinations of mode fre-
quencies (e.g. Silva Aguirre et al. 2013, Lebreton & Goupil
2014). However, when applied directly to our simple case
of a polynomial ﬁt of the r010, we obtained poor ﬁts to the
observed ratios (see gray dashed lines in Fig. 5).

After careful inspection of the results, we found that the
covariance matrix C is in fact ill-conditioned, with a condi-
tioning of the order of 105 or 106. As a result, the covariance
matrixes are nearly non-invertible, which explains the poor
agreement obtained by direct ﬁtting. This property is not
speciﬁc to our particular case, and we expect any covari-
ance matrix built with combinations of frequencies to show
similar behavior as the number of points increases. The
conditioning of matrix C increases as the number of modes
involved in the combinations of frequencies increases, which
explains why the problem is so obvious for the r010 ratios,
but with a large enough number of points, it also arises for
three-point separations. To remedy this problem, we ap-
plied truncated SVD to the covariance matrix as explained
in Appendix B. We found that suppressing the 5 smallest
eigenvalues of matrix C is generally enough to obtain sat-
isfactory ﬁts to the observed r010 ratios (red dashed lines
in Fig. 5).

4. Measuring the size of mixed cores in Kepler

targets

Since the r010 ratios have been shown to eﬃciently can-
cel out the contribution from the outer layers (Roxburgh &
Vorontsov 2003), the observed ratios could be directly com-
pared to those of models. We thus confronted the observed
r010 ratios to those of two grids of models: the one com-
puted with Cesam2k, which was described in Sect. 2.2,
and a second equivalent grid that was built with the evo-
lutionary code MESA (Paxton et al. 2011, Paxton et al.
2013), which is described below. Obviously, these grids are

tributed errors (e.g. Davies et al. 2015).

Article number, page 8 of 27

too coarse to provide in themselves statistically reliable es-
timates of the stellar parameters, and in particular of the
amount of core overshooting. However, based on the tests
performed in Sect. 2.2, these grids can be used to identify
stars with a convective core and obtain a rough estimate of
the extension of the mixed core in these stars. As a second
step presented in Sect. 5, these estimates were reﬁned using
a more sophisticated optimization procedure.

4.1. Cesam2k models

For each star of the sample, we selected among the grid de-
scribed in Sect. 2.2.1 the models that have a surface metal-
licity within 3 σ of the spectroscopic [Fe/H] (all metallicities
were included in the cases where no spectroscopic measure-
ment was available), and a stellar mass within 3 σ of the
estimate obtained from scaling laws (see Table 1). Among
the selected evolutionary sequences, we retained only the
models whose mean large separations bracket the observed
∆ν. We note that for both models and observations, the
mean value of ∆ν was estimated using only the modes be-
low νmax so that the corresponding large separations are
only slightly aﬀected by near-surface eﬀects.

For the selected models, we ﬁtted polynomials to the
r010 ratio as deﬁned by Eq. 6. For this purpose, we used
the same modes and the same values of β, γ1, and γ2 (see
Eq. 6) as those found from the observations, so that the
parameters ai of the models can be directly compared to
the observed ones. Since the models that we retained do
not exactly match the observed large separation, we per-
formed an interpolation to obtain the parameters ai that
correspond exactly to the observed ∆ν. This process was
repeated for all the stars of the sample. Fig. 6 through 9
show the location of the selected models and the observa-
tions in the (a1, a0) plane.

The ﬁrst comforting observation is that all the observed
stars occupy a place in the (a1, a0) plane that is populated
by models. This shows that in all cases, there exist models
that simultaneously reproduce the observed trend of the
r010 ratio and the other global observational constraints.

Fig. 7: Location in the (a1, a0) plane of the MS stars for which the presence of a convective core is uncertain. The
symbols have the same meaning as in Fig. 6.

Secondly, as anticipated in the previous section, the evo-
lutionary status of the observed stars can be unambiguously
established in most cases using the diagnostic from the r010
ratios. For 13 stars of the sample, the proﬁle of the r010
ratio is only compatible with MS models, the PoMS mod-
els lying at least several σ away in the (a1, a0) plane (see
Fig. 6 and 7). Conversely, 10 stars are clearly in the PoMS
phase judging by their location in the (a1, a0) plane (see
Fig. 8 and 9). We stress that it was not obvious at ﬁrst
sight that these 10 stars are in the subgiant phase. Indeed,
the PoMS status of solar-like pulsators is generally estab-
lished by the presence of mixed modes in their oscillation
spectrum. However, at the beginning of the subgiant phase,
the lowest order g modes have not yet reached the frequency

range of observed modes and such a diagnostic cannot be
applied. It is the case for these 10 stars of the sample, and
we here showed that the general trend of the r010 ratios is a
powerful diagnostic for the evolutionary status in this case.
The evolutionary status remains ambiguous only for one
star of the sample, KIC9410862, which is either at the end
of the main sequence or at the beginning of the subgiant
phase (Fig. 7).

Among the 13 MS targets, eight have values of the pa-
rameters a0 and a1 that can be reproduced only by models
that have a convective core. These stars are listed in Table 2
and their locations in the (a1, a0) plane are shown in Fig. 6.
As predicted in Sect. 2.2, we were able to use the position
in the (a1, a0) plane of the stars that have a convective core

to obtain an estimate of the amount of core overshooting.
Interestingly, the eight stars draw a quite consistent picture
of the extension of convective cores in low-mass stars.

of core overshooting as implemented in the evolution
code Cesam2k, which is addressed in more details in
Sect. 5.

– All the targets require an extended core compared to
the classical Schwarzschild criterion.
Indeed, all the
stars that have a convective core lie several σ away from
models computed without overshooting.

– None of the targets were found to be consistent with a

core overshooting above αov = 0.2.

– The only target which is consistent with a core over-
shooting around αov = 0.2 (KIC7206837) corresponds
to the highest-mass star of the sample (1.54 ± 0.09 M⊙
according to seismic scaling relations). This raises the
question of a potential mass-dependence of the amount

We stress that seismology provides information about
the size of the mixed core at the current age of the star. The
amounts of overshooting that are quoted above are those re-
quired so that the evolution code Cesam2k produces cores
with an appropriate size. One should be careful that the
values that were obtained for αov hold only for the prescrip-
tion of core overshooting that is implemented in Cesam2k
and they should not be directly applied to other codes. We
discuss this point in details in Sect. 5.

in Fig. 6.

A more relevant result to quote is the extent of the
mixed core obtained from seismic constraints. To determine
this for each of the stars for which a convective core was
detected, we selected a subset of optimal models from the
grid of models, deﬁned as those that minimize the quantity

where the Oobs
correspond to the N observables used to
constrain the models, namely the eﬀective temperature Teﬀ,
the surface metallicity (Z/X) (if available), the asteroseis-
mic log g, and the parameters a0 and a1 of the 2nd order
polynomial ﬁt of the observed r010 ratio. The σi are the
measurement errors, and the Omod
are the values corre-
sponding to the observables computed from the models.
We note that the observables can be regarded as indepen-
dent (since we ﬁtted a sum of orthogonal polynomials to
the observed ratios) so that Eq. 7 holds. For each star, the
fractional mass of the convective core Mc/M⋆ for the ﬁve
best models is shown in Fig. 10 (blue squares for Cesam2k
models). We note that the spreads in Mc/M⋆ observed in
Fig. 10 cannot be interpreted as uncertainties on this quan-
tity. Indeed, to estimate proper uncertainties one should
have chosen the set of optimal models based on the varia-
tions of the χ2 function compared to the lowest value of χ2
in the grid (∆χ2 = 1, 4, and 9 provide 1, 2, and 3 σ errors,

respectively) but the grid computed here is too coarse to
make such an approach possible4.

4.2. MESA models

As mentioned above, we have also computed a second grid
of models with the evolution code MESA (Paxton et al.
2011, Paxton et al. 2013).

The MESA models were computed using the OPAL
2005 equation of state from the tables of Rogers & Nay-
fonov (2002), which are completed at lower temperature
by the tables of Saumon et al. (1995). MESA opacity ta-
bles are constructed by combining radiative opacities with
the electron conduction opacities from Cassisi et al. (2007).
Radiative opacities are taken from Ferguson et al. (2005)
for 2.7 < log T < 4.5 and OPAL opacities Iglesias & Rogers
(1993, 1996) for 3.75 < log T < 8.7. The low tempera-
ture opacities of Ferguson et al. (2005) include the eﬀects
of molecules and grains on the radiative opacity. The nu-
clear reaction rates module from MESA contains the rates
computed by Caughlan & Fowler (1988) and Angulo et al.
(1999) (NACRE), with preference given to the NACRE
rates when available. The atmosphere was described as
Hopf’s gray law. We used the solar mixture from Grevesse
& Noels (1993). Convection was treated using the classi-
cal mixing-length theory (MLT, Böhm-Vitense 1958) with

4 Proper uncertainties on the core sizes are obtained from op-
timizations in Sect. 5.1

a ﬁxed mixing length parameter αMLT = 1.9, which corre-
sponds to a solar calibration (Paxton et al. 2011).

Core overshooting is included and described as a dif-
fusive process, following Herwig (2000). For this purpose,
an extra diﬀusion is added at the edge of the core, with a
coeﬃcient

(8)

Dov(r) = D0 exp(cid:20)−

2(r − rs)

f HP

(cid:21)

where D0 is the MLT-derived diﬀusion coeﬃcient near the
Schwarzschild boundary, HP is the pressure scale height at
this location, and f is the adjustable overshooting parame-
ter. To avoid unrealistically large extensions of convective
cores, the current version of MESA uses a modiﬁed value

(9)

eHP for the pressure scale height, deﬁned as
eHP = rs/αMLT

in the case where the mixing length ℓMLT = αMLTHP be-
comes larger than the Schwarzschild limit rs of the core.
This prescription is diﬀerent from the one adopted in the
Cesam2k code. When using the same prescription for
core overshooting (instantaneous or diﬀusive) and the same
overshooting parameter at the boundary of small convective
cores, the approach followed by MESA is expected to yield
core extensions that are smaller by a factor αMLT compared
to the extensions produced with the Cesam2k approach in
the saturated regime.

Gravitational settling and chemical diﬀusion are taken
into account by solving the equations of Burgers (1969)
using the method and diﬀusion coeﬃcients of Thoul et al.
(1994).

For each star of the sample, we performed the same
model selection as was done with Cesam2k models, and
for each selected model we ﬁtted 2nd-order polynomials to
the r010 ratios in the same way as described in Sect. 4.1.
This allowed us to compare the location of the observed
stars in the (a1, a0) plane to that of MESA models. Fig.
11 shows the results obtained for four stars of the sample,
which are representative of the diﬀerent cases identiﬁd in
Sect. 4.1: KIC8228742 and KIC7206837 are in the MS and
have a convective core, KIC6106415 is in the MS but has
no convective core, and KIC6933899 is in the PoMS.

The MESA grid agrees with the Cesam2k grid on the
evolutionary status of all the stars of the sample. The
star KIC94110862, whose evolutionary status was uncertain
based on Cesam2k models, was found to be more consis-
tent with models shortly after the end of the MS using
the MESA grid. Additionally, the eight stars identiﬁed as
having a convective core with the Cesam2k grid were also
found to have one with the MESA grid. The locations of
two of these stars in the (a1, a0) plane are shown in the up-
per panels of Fig. 11. It is clear that the extension can be
estimated from the a0 and a1 parameters, as was claimed
in Sect. 4.1. Interestingly, all the conclusions reached with
Cesam2k models about the amount of overshooting that

Fig. 10: Fractional mass of the convective core for the eight
stars that were found to have a convective core in this study.
For each star, the open symbols correspond to the core size
of the ﬁve models of the two grids (blue squares for Ce-
sam2k models, red circles for mesa models) that yield the
lowest values of χ2 as deﬁned by Eq. 7. The ﬁlled squares

optimization and the evolution code Cesam2k (see Sect.
5.1).

is required are conﬁrmed. The eight stars with convective
cores all require an extended core with overshooting pa-
rameters ranging from 0.010 to 0.035, and the star that
requires the largest amount of overshooting corresponds to
the highest-mass stars of the sample (KIC7206837) as was
found in Sect. 4.1.

Obviously, the overshooting parameters obtained from
the MESA models are not directly comparable to those
found from the Cesam2k grid because a diﬀusive over-
shooting was chosen in MESA models. A more detailed
comparison is provided in Sect. 5.2, but we can already
compare directly the absolute sizes of the extended cores
found with both evolution codes. For all the stars that
have a convective core, we selected the ﬁve models of the
MESA grid that minimize the χ2 function as deﬁned by Eq.
7. The fractional mass of the mixed core Mc/M⋆ in these
models is shown in Fig. 10. Interestingly, there is a quite
good agreement on the size of the extended cores obtained
with both evolution codes, in spite of the diﬀerent prescrip-
tions for core overshooting. This is further indication that
the seismic diagnostic based on r010 ratios can provide a
measurement of the size of the mixed core mostly indepen-
dently of the input physics, as was already suggested by
Silva Aguirre et al. (2011).

4.3. Instantaneous vs diﬀusive mixing beyond convective

cores

In this study, we have chosen to adopt two diﬀerent pre-
scriptions for core overshooting, an instantaneous over-
shooting (Cesam2k models) and a diﬀusive overshooting
(MESA models), with the aim to confront the two most

diﬀusive overshooting (f = 0.02) and a 1.3-M⊙ mass (blue
squares) and the other with a step overshooting (αov =
0.22) and a 1.31-M⊙ mass (red circles). Both models have
the same mean large separation.

frequently used prescriptions to Kepler data.
It is inter-
esting to address the question whether we can distinguish
between these two types of mixing beyond convective cores
using r010 ratios. The MESA code oﬀers the possibil-
ity to test this since both treatments have been imple-
mented. We computed a 1.3-M⊙ MESA model including
diﬀusive overshooting with a parameter f = 0.020, which
we evolved until Xc has dropped to 0.2 (chosen arbitrarily).
We also computed a MESA model including a step over-
shooting with αov = 0.22 and a slightly higher mass (1.31
M⊙) evolved until it has the same large separation as the
diﬀusive-overshooting model. We found that both models
are undistinguishable from an observational point of view
(within typical observational errors), and they also share
a very similar behavior of the r010 ratios, as is shown in
Fig. 12. This shows that the seismic diagnostic based on
the r010 ratios is unfortunately not capable of distinguish-
ing between the two scenarios regarding the nature of the
extra mixing beyond the core.

5. Toward a calibration of core overshooting for

low-mass stars

In Sect. 4, we were able to measure the sizes of mixed
cores in eight low-mass stars using seismology. The ques-
tion is then how these results can be used to estimate the
eﬃciency of the extra-mixing beyond convective cores. An-
swering this question is not straightforward. One could
consider simply comparing the convective core masses ob-
tained in Sect. 4 to the convective core masses that would
be obtained with identical stellar parameters but no mixing
beyond the core. This is however inapplicable in practice
because increasing the size of the convective core at the be-
ginning of the main sequence has large subsequent eﬀects
on its composition and evolution. For stars in the mass
range that we considered here, the main eﬀect is that the
abundance of 3He in the core increases, which increases its
luminosity, and thus also its size because the Schwarzschild

S. Deheuvels et al.: Measuring the extent of convective cores in low-mass stars using Kepler data

radius increases. For instance, extending the convective
core of a 1.3-M⊙ star over 10% of the Schwarzschild radius
in fact results in an increase of the core radius of as much
as 50% during the main sequence. Another consequence
is that the lifetime of small convective cores can be dra-
matically extended (see Roxburgh 1985, Deheuvels et al.
2010b). For instance, a stellar model of KIC62245718 com-
puted with the same stellar parameters as those found in
Sect. 4 but without including any extra-mixing beyond the
core has lost its convective core at current age.

It therefore seems that the problem of the eﬃciency of
convective core extensions cannot be studied independently
from the evolution of the star, even though asteroseismol-
ogy only tells us about the size of the mixed core at current
age. We thus chose to estimate the eﬃciency of the extra-
mixing beyond the core by adjusting the overshooting pa-
rameter (αov for instantaneous mixing or f for diﬀusive
mixing) considered constant throughout the evolution, so
that stellar models have the right convective core size at
current age. As mentioned in the introduction, so far we
have had to model convective core extensions using such
simplistic parametric models because we lack observational
constraints that would justify using more complex models.
Our aim in this section is to search for correlations between
the eﬃciency of overshooting and properties of stellar in-
teriors, which might eventually give us better insight on
the physical processes that are responsible for core exten-
sions, and lead us to prefer more realistic modelings of this
phenomenon. On the shorter term, this type of study can
enable us to propose a calibration of the overshooting pa-
rameter, which can later be used in 1D stellar models.

5.1. Calibration of core overshooting in Cesam2k

To calibrate core overshooting in Cesam2k models, we
needed to obtain more quantitative estimates of the
amounts of core overshooting that are required for the stars
of the sample.

5.1.1. Stars with a convective core

We performed optimizations for the eight stars that were
found to have a convective core in Sect. 4. For this pur-
pose, we used the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which is
an appealing alternative to grid-search minimization when
the number of free parameters is large. This algorithm
combines the low sensitivity to initial guesses of the gradi-
ent search method and the rapidity of convergence of the
Newton-Raphson method. Its use has ﬁrst been suggested
for the purpose of stellar modeling by Miglio & Montalbán
(2005). The main drawback of such an optimization tech-
nique is the risk to converge toward a secondary minimum
of the cost function if the initial guesses are to far from
the optimum set of parameters. In our particular case, this
risk is minimized since we used the best models of the grid
computed in Sect. 4.1 as initial guesses.

To ﬁnd optimal models, we minimized the quantity χ2
as deﬁned in Eq. 7. We used the same observables as those
listed in Sect. 4.2, to which we added the frequency of the
lowest-order observed radial mode. This observable is pre-
ferred to the observed mean large separation because of its
lower dependence on the structure of the outer layers. We
note that the a2 parameter of the 2nd order polynomial ﬁt

of the observed r010 ratio was here included as a constraint.
This parameter becomes constraining for evolved stars, for
which the observed r010 ratios depart from a simple linear
relation (see Fig. 1). To reproduce these observables ﬁve
parameters were left free: the stellar mass, age, initial he-
lium abundance Yi, initial metallicity (Z/X)i, and the pa-
rameter of core overshooting αov. We imposed a lower limit
of 0.24 for Yi in order to exclude models with initial helium
abundances signiﬁcantly below the standard big bang nucle-
osynthesis (SBBN) values of Y0 = 0.248 ± 0.007 (Steigman
2010). To limit the number of free parameters, we kept the
mixing length ﬁxed to αCGM = 0.64, which was obtained
from a solar calibration. As a consequence, the ﬁt that
we performed has two degrees of freedom and a reduced
red was thus obtained by dividing the regular χ2 by
value χ2
two. For each star, two types of optimizations were per-
formed, one where the eﬀects of microscopic diﬀusion are
neglected, and another that includes these eﬀects following
the formalism of Burgers 1969. This procedure enabled us
to test the inﬂuence of microscopic diﬀusion on the amount
of core overshooting that is required. As mentioned above,
diﬀusion increases the abundance of heavy elements in the
core and thus the opacity, which results in an increase in
the size of the convective core. We therefore expected to
require less core overshooting when microscopic diﬀusion
is included. Since Cesam2k does not include the compu-
tation of radiative accelerations of chemical elements, their
eﬀect was neglected in this study. Since radiative levitation
acts against gravitational settling in the interior of stars
with masses above about 1.2 M⊙, our models including mi-
croscopic diﬀusion likely overestimate the sinking of heavy
elements in this mass range. We thus expect our mod-
els computed with microscopic diﬀusion and stellar masses
above 1.2 M⊙ to provide us with an upper limit to the ef-
fects of diﬀusion, in particular on the sizes of convective
cores.

The parameters of the best-ﬁt models are given in Ta-
ble 2. The quoted error bars were obtained as the diagonal
coeﬃcients of the inverse of the Hessian matrix. The re-
sults conﬁrm that the amount of core overshooting can be
well constrained by using the parameters ai. The values
obtained for αov range from 0.07 to 0.18 in the case with-
out diﬀusion, which is in good agreement with the results
of the grids of models (Sect. 4.1). As foreseen, the mod-
els that include microscopic diﬀusion require lower amounts
of core overshooting to reproduce the seismic observations,
with values ranging from 0.05 to 0.15. However, our results
show that the eﬀects of diﬀusion cannot account in them-
selves for the entire extension of convective cores since core
overshooting was required for all eight stars of the sam-
ple. We note that for several stars of the sample, the ﬁtted
value of the initial helium abundance Yi coincides with the
lower limit of 0.24 that we have imposed to avoid sub-SBBN
helium abundances. Similar results have been found in sev-
eral studies where seismic modelings were performed (e.g.
Metcalfe et al. 2014, Silva Aguirre et al. 2015). This is
potentially the consequence of the well-known correlation
between stellar mass and helium abundance (Lebreton &
Goupil 2012). For these stars, we have performed addi-
tional ﬁts imposing a higher limit to Yi (0.26) and found
results that agree within 1-σ errors with the values quoted
in Table 2 (in particular, we found very little diﬀerence
in the sizes of convective cores, which is our main inter-
est here). The optimizations also provided estimates of the

stellar mass, which are given in Table 2. The agreement
with estimates from scaling laws is quite good (below 1.3 σ
for all the stars). We note that KIC12009504 was already
modeled by Silva Aguirre et al. (2013) who already found
that this stars possesses a convective core that extends be-
yond the Schwarzschild limit. Our results for this star are
in good agreement with those of Silva Aguirre et al. (2013).
red for some of our ﬁts are signiﬁcantly
larger than 1, which in principle indicates either disagree-
ments between models and observations, or underestimated
error bars for the observables. Table 2 gives the level of
agreement with observations for each ﬁtted parameter nor-
malized by observational 1-σ errors. It shows that a very
good level of agreement is reached for the a0 and a1 pa-
rameters, as was expected based on the results of Sect. 4.
On the contrary, disagreements above the 3-σ level arise
for the a2 parameter. This occurs mainly for stars where
the r010 ratios vary nearly linearly with frequency, so that
the a2 coeﬃcient is small. In this case, the observational
estimate of a2 can be altered by the short-period oscilla-
tion that arises because of the glitch at the base of the
convection zone (see Sect. 3.3). Disagreements above the
2-σ level also arise for the eﬀective temperature and the
surface metallicity. We note that we have used the error
bars of Bruntt et al. (2012) for these quantities, which have
been deemed somewhat underestimated in previous studies
(Silva Aguirre et al. 2013). This might at least partly ex-
plain this disagreement. Also, we note that the agreement
with the observed surface metallicities improves when in-
cluding microscopic diﬀusion in models.

Using our optimizations, we could also obtain estimates
of the total size of the mixed core in the eight stars. Since
the size of the core is not a ﬁtted parameter, the optimiza-
tion algorithm does not directly provide error bars on these
obtained values. However, they can be deduced from the
relation

where the bj terms correspond to the P free parameters
and the derivatives (∂Mc/∂bj) can be evaluated with the
models used to compute the Hessian matrix. The fractional
masses of the convective cores for the eight stars are plotted
along with their error bars in Fig. 10.

The reﬁned estimates of the amount of core overshoot-
ing in the eight stars that have a convective core enabled us
to test correlations between the overshooting parameter αov
and other stellar parameters. Fig. 13a shows the obtained
values of αov as a function of the stellar mass. We observe
that there seems to be a tendency of core overshooting to
increase with stellar mass in this mass range. This tendency
is less clear for the models where microscopic diﬀusion was
included (grey circles), but we still found in this case that
the three less massive stars of the sample require less core
overshooting that the ﬁve more massive ones. Clearly more
data points are required to be more conclusive, but if such
a tendency is conﬁrmed, then an empirical law could be
derived and implemented in the Cesam2k code in order to
better model the extent of mixed cores for stars in this mass
range. We also note that we have found no apparent de-
pendency of the amount of core overshooting required with
stellar metallicity (see Fig. 13b).

5.1.2. Stars without a convective core

Information about core overshooting can also be drawn
from stars that have no convective core but lie just be-
low the mass limit for having one.
Indeed, above a cer-
tain amount of core overshooting, the models all develop
a convective core and the proﬁle of the r010 becomes at
odds with the observations. So these targets can be used
to obtain an upper limit to the amount of core overshoot-
ing. For these targets, we performed optimizations using
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as before, except that
we ﬁxed the parameter of core overshooting to predeﬁned
values ranging from 0 to 0.3. The result of this procedure
is shown as an example for the case of KIC 10516096. For
αov = 0, the ﬁt converges toward a PoMS model with a

inﬂuence of microscopic diﬀusion, in particular on the size
of the mixed core, was already addressed in Sect. 5.1.1. We
did not expect the measurement of the mixed core size to
be modiﬁed because we have conﬁrmed in this study that
its inference is mostly independent of the model physics.
However, the amount of overshooting required to produce
the appropriate core size at current age does depend on the
input physics.

Equation of state Our reference Cesam2k models were
computed using the OPAL05 equation of state (Rogers &
Nayfonov 2002). To estimate uncertainties linked to the
choice of EoS, we performed a new optimization for the
target KIC5184732 using the OPAL01 EoS instead. As can
be seen in Table 3, the ﬁtted parameters all lie within 1-σ
errors of the results obtained with the OPAL05 EoS.

reaction rates We also calculated models of
Nuclear
KIC5184732 conserving the NACRE nuclear reaction rate
for the 14N(p, γ)15O reaction instead of the revised rate
obtained from the LUNA facility (Formicola et al. 2004),
which was used in Sect. 5.1. Table 3 gives the obtained
ﬁtted parameters. The amount of overshooting that is re-
quired to produce a mixed core with the appropriate size
is signiﬁcantly reduced. This is understandable since the
NACRE cross section for the 14N(p, γ)15O reaction was
about 30 % higher than the revised LUNA rate. As a con-
sequence, models computed with this previous cross section
have a larger luminosity in the core, and thus a larger mixed
core. The other ﬁtted parameters are little modiﬁed com-
pared to the reference ﬁt.
In particular, the size of the
mixed core is unchanged, within statistical errors.

Solar mixture We adopted the solar mixture of AGSS09 for
which (Z/X⊙) = 0.0181 in our reference models in Sect.
5.1. We here explored the impact of considering instead
the solar mixture of Grevesse & Noels (1993) (GN93), for
which (Z/X⊙) = 0.0244. As can be seen from Table 3, this
new optimization converged toward a solution with roughly
the same abundance of heavy elements as in the reference
ﬁt using AGSS09. As a result, the ﬁtted parameters are
very similar to the reference case.

5.2. Applicability to MESA models

We now address the question whether the prescription ob-
tained for the Cesam2k code in Sect. 5.1 can be applied
to MESA models. We found in Sect. 4.3 that an instanta-
neous overshooting with αov is roughly equivalent to a diﬀu-
sive overshooting with f ∼ αov/10, as was already pointed
out in several studies before (e.g. Noels et al. 2010). At ﬁrst
sight this correspondence leads to believe that the MESA
models require core extensions larger than the Cesam2k
models. For instance, for the target KIC7206837, an instan-
taneous overshooting with αov = 0.18 was found necessary
with Cesam2k (see Table 2), while MESA models required
a diﬀusive overshoot parameter of f = 0.035, which would
translate into αov ≈ 0.35 according to the established cor-
respondence. However, we have mentioned in Sect. 4.2
that when using the same prescription for core overshoot-
ing (instantaneous or diﬀusive) and the same overshooting
parameter, MESA yields core extensions that are smaller

mass of 1.12 M⊙, an age of about 6.4 Gyr, a metallicity of
(Z/X) = 0.0229 and no convective core. For 0 6 αov 6 0.15,
the ﬁts converge toward roughly the same model. The only
diﬀerence between the best-ﬁt models is that the initial con-
vective core survives longer for higher values of αov (about
1 Gyr for αov = 0.15 compared to 30 Myr for αov = 0).
However, even with αov = 0.15 the convective core van-
ishes long before the end of the MS and its eﬀect on the
core structure has been washed out by the age of 6.4 Gyr.
On the contrary, for αov = 0.2 this model keeps a con-
vective core until the end of the MS. As a result, the du-
ration of the MS is extended and by the time the model
reaches the observed large separation, it is still in the MS
with a convective core and the r010 ratio of this model is
in poor agreement with the observations. Therefore, to
decrease the χ2, the ﬁt converges toward a model with
higher metallicity (Z/X = 0.0281) for which the convec-
tive core vanishes before the end of the MS. However, this
latter model is in less good agreement with the observa-
tions as can be seen in Fig. 14. We thus obtained an
upper limit of the overshooting parameter of about 0.19
for this star (value of αov above which the obtained χ2 is
larger than min(χ2) + 9). Similar results were found for
one other PoMS star (KIC 6933899) and three MS stars
(KIC 6106415, KIC 6116048, and KIC 8394589). For all
these stars, the agreement deteriorates for an upper limit
0.16 < αlim < 0.20. These constraints were added as ver-
tical arrows in Fig. 13. Unfortunately, they are too loose
to conﬁrm the tendency of αov to increase with mass that
was found in Sect. 5.1.1.

5.1.3. Sensitivity to input physics

We here brieﬂy address the question of the sensitivity of our
results to some of the choices of the model input physics.
We focused on one star (KIC5184732) chosen arbitrarily
among the stars which was found to have a convective core
and was modeled in Sect. 5.1.1. We performed additional
optimizations of this target modifying each time one as-
sumption on the model input physics. We note that the

by a factor αMLT compared to the extensions produced
with Cesam2k. Since MESA models were computed with
αMLT = 1.9, the overshooting parameters obtained with
MESA should be divided by a factor 1.9 to be compared
to the Cesam2k overshoot parameters. By doing this, we
ﬁnd that the diﬀusive overshooting parameter of f = 0.035
obtained with MESA for KIC7206837 is equivalent to an
instantaneous overshooting with αov = 0.35/1.9 ≈ 0.18 us-
ing the Cesam2k formalism, which is in agreement with
the value of αov obtained with Cesam2k for this star.

To push further the comparison between Cesam2k and
MESA in terms of convective core size, we checked that if
the exact same formalism is used for core overshooting (and
therefore the same prescription for small convective cores),
the two codes provide similar sizes for the extended convec-
tive cores. For this purpose, we evolved a 1.3-M⊙ model
with both Cesam2k and MESA, either without or with
overshooting. In the latter case we used an instantaneous
overshooting with αov = 0.1 in both codes, and redeﬁned
in MESA the overshooting distance for small convective
cores using Eq. 5 instead of Eq. 9. As shown by Fig. 15,
the variations in the core size with age are very similar for
Cesam2k (solid lines) and for MESA (dashed lines), both
in the case without overshooting (black lines) and in the
case with overshooting (red lines). The only slight diﬀer-
ences occur right after the exhaustion of the initial 12C in
the core, whose burning outside of equilibrium creates the
sharp peak in the core size between 15 and 25 Myr, and
at the end of the main sequence, whose duration is slightly
diﬀerent in the two codes because of small diﬀerences in the
input physics.

We thus conclude that the prescription for the over-
shooting parameter as a function of stellar mass obtained
with Cesam2k models should also be applicable to MESA
models, provided the exact same formalism is considered
for core overshooting. Consistency tests such as the one
presented above should be performed before applying this
prescription to other stellar evolution codes.

6. Conclusion

The main result of this paper is the detection of a con-
vective core in eight main-sequence solar-like pulsators ob-
served with the Kepler space mission, and the asteroseismic
measurement of the extent of the core in these stars.

For this purpose, we tested the seismic diagnostic for
the size of the core based on the r010 ratios, which had

els are represented by dashed lines.

been successfully applied to isolated targets before (e.g.
Silva Aguirre et al. 2013) but whose general validity had
not been addressed. By computing a grid of stellar models
with varying mass, age, helium abundance, metallicity, and
core overshooting, we established that the slope and mean
value of the r010 ratios can be used to estimate (1) whether
the star has left the main sequence or not, (2) whether it
has a convective core or not, and (3) the extent of the con-
vective core if the star possesses one. The eﬃciency of this
diagnostic stems from the presence of a sharp µ-gradient
at the boundary of the mixed core, which adds an oscilla-
tory component to the r010 ratios. Since unevolved stars
have not yet built up such a µ-gradient, the diagnostic is
ineﬀective on these targets.

Based on this, we selected a subset of 24 G and late-
F solar-like pulsators among Kepler targets, avoiding too
unevolved stars. We extracted the oscillation mode fre-
quencies of these stars using the complete Kepler data set
(nearly four years) and ﬁtted second-order polynomials to
the observed r010 ratios. At this occasion, we realized
that the covariance matrix of the observables is very ill-

conditioned, which in some cases leads the ﬁt astray. We
therefore resorted to truncated SVD to solve the problem.
This issue should be kept in mind, as it can be suspected to
occur in any seismic modeling where combinations of mode
frequencies are used as observables, as is now frequently
done (e.g. Lebreton & Goupil 2014).

By confronting the slope and mean value of the r010 ra-
tios of the 24 selected targets to those of a grid of models
computed with the Cesam2k code, we were able to estab-
lish that

– 10 of these targets are in the post main sequence and

therefore do not possess convective cores,

– 13 targets are in the main sequence (the evolutionary
status of the remaining target is uncertain) and among
them eight stars have a convective core,

– the convective cores of these eight targets extend beyond

the classical Schwarzschild boundary.

Interestingly,
identical conclusions were reached using a
similar grid of models computed with the MESA code. We
were able to obtain measurements of the extent of the con-
vective cores of the eight targets that possess one, with
a good agreement between the values obtained with Ce-
sam2k and MESA. We also produced precise estimates of
the stellar parameters of these eight stars that we obtained
through seismic modelings. Consequently, these stars are
ideal targets to test and potentially calibrate theoretical
models of physical processes that could be responsible for
the extension of convective cores, such as core overshooting
itself or rotational mixing. Before realistic models of these
processes are available, the results obtained in this paper
can be used to calibrate the simple parametric models of
convective core extensions that are included in most 1D
stellar evolution codes.

We addressed this question using the code Cesam2k, in
which cores are extended over a fraction αov of either the
pressure scale height HP , or the radius of the core in the
sense of the Schwarzschild limit if it is smaller than HP .
We were able to eﬃciently constrain αov for the eight stars,
obtaining values ranging from 0.07 to 0.18. We showed
that microscopic diﬀusion is responsible for only a small
fraction of the core extension. Interestingly, we observed a
tendency of αov to increase with stellar mass, which opens
the possibility to derive an empirical law for αov(M ) in the
mass range of observed targets (1.1 6 M/M⊙ 6 1.5), and
thus to a calibration of what is usually referred to as core
overshooting, but in fact encompasses the eﬀects of all non-
standard processes that extend convective cores. One must
be careful that such a calibration necessarily depends on
the prescription chosen to model the extension of convec-
tive cores in 1D stellar models. We can also suspect that it
depends on the evolution code itself. We have however veri-
ﬁed in this study that the sizes of convective cores produced
by the code MESA are very similar to those produced by
the code Cesam2k, provided the same prescription for core
overshooting is adopted.

This study thus constitutes a ﬁrst step towards the cal-
ibration of the extension of convective cores in low-mass
stars. Constraints on the extent of the convective cores of
more stars will be required to conﬁrm and enrich our re-
sults. In that respect, the PLATO mission (Rauer et al.
2014), which was recently selected by ESA, will be partic-
ularly helpful. Reciprocally, obtaining a calibration of the
distance over which convective cores extend will reduce the

uncertainties on stellar ages, which will be useful to stellar
physics in general, and in particular to the PLATO mis-
sion, for which the precise determination of stellar ages is
crucial.

Appendix A: Mode parameters of the selected

targets

Tables A.1 through A.6 give the ﬁtted frequencies of the
oscillation modes in the 24 selected stars among Kepler tar-
gets (see Sect. 3).

Appendix B: Polynomial ﬁt to the observed r010

ratios

We denote as y = (y1, . . . , yn) the set of n observed r010
ratios, and as x = (x1, . . . , xn) the corresponding frequen-
cies. We would like to ﬁt a 2nd-order polynomial to the
functional y(x). Since we would like to interpret individual
coeﬃcients of the polynomial regression, we need them to
be independent from one another. We are thus required to
use orthogonal polynomials. For this purpose, we ﬁt poly-
nomials of the type

P (ν) = a0 + a1(ν − β) + a2(ν − γ1)(ν − γ2)

(B.1)

to the observed ratios y, where β, γ1, and γ2 need to be
determined so as to ensure the independence of the ak co-
eﬃcients. The values taken by the polynomial P (ν) at each
point of vector x can be written in a vectorial way as

P (xi) = (Ja)i

(B.2)

where a = (a0, a1, a2), and J is an n × 3 matrix such that

Ji,0 = 1
Ji,1 = xi − β
Ji,2 = (xi − γ1)(xi − γ2)

(B.3)
(B.4)
(B.5)

In our case, the observables y are combinations of mode
frequencies and are thus highly correlated. We denote as
C the covariance matrix of the observables. At ﬁrst, let us
assume that C is invertible and denote its inverse as W. In
this case, the χ2 function to be minimized can be written
as

χ2 = (Ja − y)T W(Ja − y)

(B.6)

where the exponent T indicates matrix transposition. The
gradient of this function is given by

∇χ2 = 2JT WJa − 2JT Wy

and the optimal set of coeﬃcients is then

(B.7)

(B.8)

amin =(cid:16)JT WJ(cid:17)−1(cid:16)JT Wy(cid:17)
where (cid:16)JT WJ(cid:17)−1

corresponds to the error matrix for the
coeﬃcients ak. To ensure that these coeﬃcients are uncor-
related, we must thus require that the non-diagonal coef-
ﬁcients of the error matrix vanish. This yields the set of
equations

0 =

which can be solved to yield β, γ1, and γ2.

When ﬁtting polynomials to the r010 ratios of models,
the errors on the mode frequencies are assumed to be zero,
so the covariance matrix and its inverse W are the iden-
tity, which simpliﬁes the set of equations B.9 to B.11. In

particular, β reduces the mean of the vector of frequencies
x.

For polynomial ﬁts to the observations, one complica-
tion arises. As mentioned in Sect. 3.3, the determinant of
the covariance matrix C of the observed r010 ratios is van-
ishingly small. As a result, C is almost non-invertible and
numerical problems arise when trying to invert it. To rem-
edy this, we resorted to a truncated SVD (singular value
decomposition) approach. We computed the eigenvalues of
matrix C, further denoted λ1 > . . . > λn, and its eigen-
vectors denoted as matrix P, where Pk is the eigenvector
corresponding to the kth eigenvalue. The covariance matrix
C can thus be rewritten as PT DP, where D is the diagonal
matrix whose diagonal coeﬃcients are the λi.

Article number, page 22 of 27

The conditioning of matrix C, given by the ratio λ1/λn,
is very large (of the order of 106). We thus truncate the
n − m smallest eigenvalues in order to improve the condi-
tioning. For this purpose, the covariance matrix is approx-

matrix whose diagonal coeﬃcients are the m largest λi and

T eDeP, where eD is a diagonal
imated by the matrix eC ≡ eP
eP is an (m, n) matrix composed of the m eigenvectors cor-

responding to the retained eigenvalues. For each star, we
suppressed eigenvalues until the impact of suppressing an
eigenvalue on the results of the polynomial ﬁt is negligi-
ble. We found that suppressing n − m = 5 eigenvalues is
generally enough to ensure the latter condition.
