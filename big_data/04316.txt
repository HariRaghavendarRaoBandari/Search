Abstract
Semiclassical periodic-orbit theory (POT) is applied to the physics of nuclear structures, with
the use of a realistic nuclear mean-ﬁeld model given by the radial power-law potential.
Evolution of deformed shell structures, which are responsible for various nuclear deformations,
are clearly understood from the contribution of short classical periodic orbits (POs).
Bifurcations of short POs, which imply underlying local dynamical symmetry, play signiﬁcant
role there. The eﬀect of the spin degree of freedom is also investigated in relevance to the
pseudospin symmetry in spherical nuclei and the prolate-oblate asymmetry in shell structures of
nuclei with quadrupole-type deformations.

1. Introduction

classical orbit to be multiples of the Planck’s constant h:

Independent-particle picture is one of the most important dis-
coveries in the history of nuclear structure physics [1, 2]. Be-
cause of dominance of the single-particle motion in nuclear
dynamics, various low-energy (near-yrast) properties of nuclei
are determined by the characters of the single-particle spectra.
Therefore, it is very important to understand the properties of
the quantized independent-particle motion in the nuclear mean-
ﬁeld potentials. In general, distribution of the single-particle
energy eigenvalues shows a regularly oscillating gross struc-
ture, called shell structure and, occasionally, a modulation in
its amplitude into various kinds of beating patterns called su-
pershell structure. Those structures are quite sensitive to the
shapes of the potentials. As is well known, such gross struc-
tures in the quantum ﬂuctuations play important roles in charac-
terizing the properties of many-fermion systems like nuclei and
microclusters. However, the origins of such gross structures are
not clear from purely quantum mechanical viewpoints.

Semiclassical theory provides us useful tools to investigate
those remarkable gross shell structures in quantum dynamics.
It describes the properties of quantum systems in terms of the
classical dynamics. Speaking of a classical-quantum corre-
spondence, one may ﬁrst think about the Ehrenfest theorem,
which tells that the expectation values of quantum operators
obey the classical equations of motion. Moreover, the individ-
ual quantum states also have a close relation to the classical dy-
namics. In this relevance, one may recall the Bohr-Sommerfeld
quantization rule for a particle in one-dimensional potential
well V(x), where the energy eigenvalues {en} are determined
by the condition that the action integral along once around the

Here, p(x; e) = √2m(e − V(x)) represents the momentum of

the particle moving along the x axis with energy e. The in-
tegration limits x1 and x2 are given by the classical turning
points satisfying p(xi; e) = 0. Semiclassical periodic-orbit the-
ory (POT) based on the Feynman’s path integral formalism has
been developed since 1960s. Gutzwiller derived the famous
trace formula [3] in which the quantum level density (density
of states) is expressed in terms of the classical periodic orbits
(POs). This formula gives a deep understanding on the origin
of quantum ﬂuctuations. Even the individual quantum states in
non-integrable systems can be approximately constructed from
classical dynamics by the use of the trace formula, but here at-
tention will be focused on its important aspects in applications
to the gross shell and supershell structures.

In section 2, semiclassical theories for the single-particle
level densities and for the ﬂuctuations in energies of many-
body systems are brieﬂy outlined. We will discuss the role
of the classical POs, especially on the importance of the PO

nuclear exotic deformations (superdeformations and octupole
deformations) and the roles of PO bifurcations are analyzed.

2. Semiclassical theory of shell structure

As one sees from the successes in the mean-ﬁeld approaches
to nuclear many-body problems, quantum ﬂuctuations in phys-
ical quantities are originated mainly from the shell eﬀect due
to the quantized single-particle motions in the mean ﬁeld po-
tential.
In this section, we ﬁrst describe the Strutinsky shell
correction method to extract shell energy, the ﬂuctuation part
of the energy for many-body systems, from the single-particle
spectrum. It will be shown that the shell energy is expressed in
terms of the oscillating part of the single-particle level density.
Next, we give a brief introduction to the semiclassical formula
for the level density and shell energy, whose oscillating part
is expressed as the sum over contribution of the classical POs.
We will emphasize the importance of PO bifurcations for the
enhancement of shell eﬀect.

2.1. Shell correction method

In the independent particle picture for an interacting many
fermion system, the constituent particle motion is quantized
with the self-consistent mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian. Particles are
arranged to the quantized states according to the Fermi statistics
so that they minimize the total energy. Due to the interaction,
total energy of the system considerably diﬀers from a simple
sum of the single-particle energies

Esp(N) =

e j.

N

Xj=1

(2)

However, the oscillating part or Esp is found to successfully de-
scribe the energy ﬂuctuation of the total many-particle system.
Strutinsky has derived the way with which one can unambigu-
ously decompose Esp into the average and oscillating parts [4,5]
as

Esp(N) = ¯Esp(N) + δE(N).

(3)

By employing the realistic mean ﬁeld model and replacing the
¯Esp with more reliable semi-empirical formula,
average part
e.g. the liquid drop model (LDM),

E(N) = ELDM(N) + δE(N),

(4)

one can systematically describe the observed nuclear binding
energies in good precisions.

To calculate the oscillating part δE from the single-particle
spectra e j, one ﬁrst decompose the single-particle level density

g(e) =Xj

δ(e − e j)

into the average and oscillating parts

g(e) = ¯g(e) + δg(e).

(6)

The average part is obtained by convolving the total one with
a smoothing function f , for which a normalized gaussian of

¯gγ(e) =

Here, the 2M th order curvature corrections are given by the
Laguerre polynomial L(1/2)
M , and we take 2M = 6 in our numer-
ical calculations. For a given γ, the smoothed Fermi energies
¯eF is deﬁned thorough the particle-number condition

and the average part of (3) is obtained by

The smoothing width γ is determined so that ¯Esp satisﬁes the
so-called plateau condition

¯Esp(N; γ) ≈ 0,

(10)

in order that the obtained ¯Esp(N) is less dependent on the phys-
ically meaningless parameter γ. Inserting g(e) = ¯g(e) + δg(e)
into the particle-number condition for the exact Fermi energy
eF, one has the relation

In the last step, the ﬁrst e in the integrand of the second term is
replaced with eF, assuming eF − ¯eF to be suﬃciently small, and
then the relation (11) is used. The last expression (12) for the
shell energy will be used in the derivation of its semiclassical
formula in the next subsection.

2.2. Level density in semiclassical approximation

In the small  limit, the quantum wave equation reduces to the
classical equation of motion. Inserting the wave function of the
form ψ(r, t) = eiF(r,t)/ into the Schr¨odinger equation i∂ψ/∂t =
ˆHψ(r, t) and expand F in powers of  as F = F0 + F1 + · · · ,
one has the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation for F0 = S :

the classical Hamiltonian. In the next-to-leading order, putting
F1(r, t) = 1

probability density ρ = |ψ|2:

(14a)

(14b)

and one has a picture of ﬂuid running according to the classical
equations of motion. In this way, the quantum dynamics can be
related to the classical dynamics in the semiclassical approxi-
mation. Especially, classical POs are shown to play the central
role in the level density and shell energy [3,6,7]. In the follow-
ing, we shall brieﬂy outline how the semiclassical formulas for
the level density and shell energy are derived from the Feyn-
man’s path integral representation for the quantum propagator,
and discuss the important aspects of the formulas in analyzing
gross shell structures.

Energy level density g(e) is given by the trace of the retarded

Connection between quantum and classical mechanics is de-
rived from the path integral representation for the propagator

K(r′′, r′, t) =Z D[r(t)] exp" i

L(˙r, r)dt′# ,

(19)

where the integral is taken over arbitrary paths connecting ini-
tial point r′ and ﬁnal point r′′ in time t. D[r(t)] is the inte-
gration measure associated with the path r(t), and L is the La-
grangian function. The semiclassical formula of the propagator
valid for small  is obtained by carrying out the above path in-
tegral using the stationary phase method (SPM).

For an introduction to the basic concept of the SPM, let us

consider a one-dimensional integral of the form

I =Z dq A(q)eiS (q)/,

(20)

with A(q) and S (q) being moderate functions of q. Since  is
small, above integrand is a rapidly oscillating function of q and
may have no noticeable contribution to the integral due to the
strong cancellation. Such cancellation is avoided in vicinity of
the stationary point q∗ of the function S (q) satisfying S ′(q∗) =
0, and it makes a dominant contribution to the integral. In the
standard SPM, S (q) is expanded around the stationary point
q∗ up to a quadratic order, and the above integral is evaluated

approximately as

I ≈ A(q∗)Z ∞
dq exp" i
= A(q∗)eiS (q∗)/s 2πi

−∞

S ′′(q∗)

nS (q∗) + 1

2 S ′′(q∗)(q − q∗)2o#

.

(21)

In general, S (q) has several stationary points and equation (21)
will be expressed in the sum over terms associated with all
those points. This approximation is good for an isolated sta-
tionary point. However, it becomes worse as the second deriva-
tive S ′′(q∗) becomes smaller, and then one should consider
some higher order expansions of the action S (q) around q∗.

Since the phase in equation (19) is the action integral along
the path, the stationary solutions are nothing but the classical
trajectory satisfying Hamilton’s variational principle. Then, the
propagator is expressed as the sum over contributions of clas-
sical trajectories. A detailed and clear derivation of the semi-
classical formula from the path integral representation is found
e.g., in section 7 of [8]. The result is expressed as

Kcl(r′′, r′, t) =

1

p(2π)3 Xα pDα exp" i



Rα −

iπνα

2 # , (22)

which is known as the Van-Vleck formula. The sum in the
right-hand side is taken over classical trajectories α starting
from r′ and arriving at r′′ in time t. Rα represents the action
integral along α,

Rα =Z t

0

and Dα is given by

L(r(t′), ˙r(t′))dt′,

r(0) = r′,

r(t) = r′′

(23)

Dα = det −

∂p′!−1
! = det  ∂r′′

(24)

which is related to the stability of the trajectory with respect to
the initial condition. να counts the number of conjugate points
along the trajectory α, where the semiclassical propagator en-
counters singularities in coordinate space. Such singularities
can be avoided by the Fourier transformation from the coor-
dinate to momentum space before it encounters the conjugate
point and then inverse Fourier transformation into coordinate
space again after passing through the point. This can be also
coped with by the catastrophe theory [9]. In such procedure,
one generally has the delay of phase by π/2, as in the case of
one-dimensional WKB wave function at the classical turning
point.

Using the above semiclassical propagator Kcl in the Green’s
function (17) and inserting it into equation (15), the level den-
sity is expressed in the form

gcl(e) =Z drXα

where the sum is now taken over the closed orbits which start
r with energy e and return to r again. S α is the Legendr´e trans-
form of the action integral Rα, whose independent variable is
transformed from time t to energy e = −∂Rα/∂t as

Nuclear shell structures in terms of classical periodic orbits

For a while, we shall leave out the explicit form of the prefactor
Aα for simplicity, just mentioning that it is related to the stabil-
ity of the trajectory with respect to the initial condition. Finally,
the trace integral over r is carried out with the use of the SPM.
The stationary phase condition is expressed as

∂S (r, r; e)

Coincidence of initial and ﬁnal momenta p′′ = p′ implies the
orbit to be periodic. Hence, the semiclassical level density is
expressed in terms of POs as

(28)

The ﬁrst term ¯g(e) represents the average level density which
corresponds to the contribution of zero-length orbit. The sec-
ond term gives the oscillating part of the level density. The sum
is taken over all the POs (not only primitive ones but also their

orbit β, and µβ is the so-called Maslov phase index related to
the geometric properties of the orbit β.

repetitions). S β(e) = Hβ

The prefactor Aβ(e) is also expressed in terms of the clas-
sical characteristics of the orbit β, such as the stability, period
and degeneracy. Since the action S β(e) is in general a monoton-
ically increasing function of energy e, each contribution of the
PO gives an oscillating function of e, whose successive minima
appear in a distance given by

∆e =

dS β/de

Tβ

.

(29)

Tβ represents the period of the orbit β. This implies that the
shorter POs having smaller periods Tβ contribute to the level
density oscillations of larger energy scales (having larger ∆e).
Therefore, the gross shell structure is determined by some
shortest POs [10, 11]. Longer POs contribute to a ﬁner struc-
ture superimposed on the gross one. Since the contributions
of the POs having diﬀerent periods give the terms oscillating
with diﬀerent ∆e, they will interfere and build a certain beat-
ing pattern. The supershell structures, the modulations in shell
structures, can be understood as the result of such interference
eﬀect. Balian and Bloch [6] have found a remarkable beating
pattern in the coarse-grained level density for spherical cav-
ity model, and it is understood as the interference eﬀect of the
equilateral triangular and square PO contributions. Nishioka
et al have employed the semiclassical trace formula to account
for the supershell structures in metallic clusters [12]. They have
applied the idea of Balian and Bloch to a more realistic Woods-
Saxon (WS) type mean ﬁeld model, and have shown that the
supershell structures observed in metallic clusters are success-
fully understood as the interference eﬀect of the triangular and
square-type POs. This is considered as one of the greatest suc-
cesses in physical applications of the POT.

Let us next derive the semiclassical expression for the shell

energy δE(N). Inserting the semiclassical level density

into equation (12) and evaluating the integral using the semi-
classical approximation, one obtains [10, 11]

(31)

¿From the ﬁrst to second line in (31), the fact is used that the
integrand in vicinity of the end point e ≈ eF makes the chief
contribution to the integral because the integrand is a rapidly
oscillating function of energy due to the smallness of  and
strong oﬀsetting eﬀect arises a little deep inside the integration
region. Owing to the additional factor (/Tβ)2 in the last ex-
pression in equation (31), the contribution of longer POs are
relatively suppressed, compared to the trace formula for the
level density, and one usually needs only a small number of
the shortest POs for the study of shell energies.

2.3. Periodic-orbit bifurcation and local dynamical symmetry

There are several diﬀerent ways of deriving PO expansion for-
mula depending on the integrability of the system. For a fully
integrable (multiply-periodic) system, it is convenient to use
the action-angle variables {I, ϕ}, where the action variables I
are constants of motion and the Hamiltonian is independent of
the angle variables ϕ. In an f -dimensional multiply-periodic
system, generic classical trajectory is conﬁned on a torus, an f -
dimensional hypersurface in the phase space formed for given
values of I with varying ϕ. In such a system, energy is quan-
tized according to the EBK (Einstein-Brillouin-Keller) torus
quantization rule [7]

(nk = 0, 1, 2, · · · )
the one-dimensional Bohr-
which is a generalization of
Sommerfeld quantization rule (1) to multi-dimensional inte-
grable systems. Here, Ik is taken as the action integral along
the k th irreducible loop Γk on the torus (which cannot be re-
duced to a point by any continuous deformation), and αk is the
so-called Maslov index which counts the caustic points encoun-
tered along Γk. Based on this quantization rule, Berry and Ta-
bor derived a formula for the level density expressed as the sum
over terms associated with the classical POs [13]. Creagh and
Littlejohn have shown that the above Berry-Tabor formula can
be also derived from the phase-space path integral representa-
tion of the quantum propagator [14]. For partially integrable
systems, some of the trace integrals are carried out exactly, and
they bring a factor proportional to the phase-space volume oc-
cupied by the PO family. Other integrals are carried out by
the SPM, and they bring a factor related to the stability of the
PO [14]. For a strongly chaotic system in which all the POs are
isolated, one obtains the Gutzwiller trace formula [3, 7]

energy surface. This phase plane deﬁnes a stroboscopic map-
ping known as Poicar´e map: If the energy surface is compact,
the trajectory starting at the point Z on the phase plane Σ will
certainly intersect the same plane again, say, at point Z′ with
the same orientation as it started oﬀ (see ﬁgure 1). The map

which returns to the initial point by the n th intersection.

The stability of the PO characterizes the behavior of adja-
cent trajectories with initial conditions inﬁnitesimally shifted
from Z∗. Expanding the Poincar´e map around the PO Z∗, the

The symbol ⊥ indicates that the derivatives are taken with re-
spect to the coordinates perpendicular to the PO, or to the man-
ifold formed by the PO family under continuous symmetry. As
mentioned above, the standard SPM breaks down if the curva-
ture C vanishes. Let us show that a PO bifurcation is associated
with this singularity.

ceed from the top to lower panels. POs correspond to the stationary
points q∗ of the action S (q), and are indicated by dots. The number
of POs changes when the parameter δ passes over the value δbif where
the curvature C = S ′′(q∗) vanishes. The bifurcations shown in the left
and right columns are called “pitchfork bifurcation” and “tangent bi-
furcation”, respectively, named after the shapes of the graphs shown
in the bottom panel, where the stationary points are plotted as func-
tions of the parameter δ. The inverse processes (PO association or
annihilation) are also called “bifurcation” in a broad sense.

Figure 2 illustrates two typical scenarios of the PO bifurca-
tions. As wee see in equation (27), POs correspond to the sta-
tionary points of the action integral S (q) along the closed orbit
which start from q and returns to q again. Let us consider the
situation in the top left panel in ﬁgure 2 where a single station-
ary point exists at q∗ and the curvature C is positive there. One
has the factor proportional to 1/ √C by the integration with the
SPM. With varying a parameter in the Hamiltonian, say, the
deformation parameter δ, action S (q) will continuously change
and the curvature C may happen to vanish at δ = δbif as il-
lustrated in the 2nd-row panel. After passing over this point,
the sign of the curvature C = S ′′(q∗) changes as illustrated in
the 3rd-row panel, and one has new stationary points at both
sides of the original one. This is a scenario of the PO bifurca-
tion which is known as pitchfork bifurcation. Another type of
bifurcation scenario called tangent bifurcation (or saddle-node
bifurcation) is shown in the right column of ﬁgure 2, where
a pair of stable and unstable POs are newly produced at the
“bifurcation” deformation rather than emerging from already

existing one.1 All the possible bifurcations in Hamiltonian sys-
tems are classiﬁed into six basic types by the catastrophe theory
(see e.g. [15, 16]).

Due to the proportionality det(Mβ − I) ∝ C, the monodromy
matrix M has a unit eigenvalue if the curvature C vanishes.
This unit eigenvalue suggests the formation of a local PO fam-
ily around the bifurcating PO. If M has a unit eigenvalue, the
associated eigenvector X1 satisﬁes the relation

M(Z∗ + cX1) ≃ Z∗ + cMX1 = Z∗ + cX1,

(39)

where c is a small continuous parameter. Hence, Z∗ + cX1 gives
the continuous family of quasi-periodic family in vicinity of the
PO Z∗ as shown in the 2nd-row panels of ﬁgure 2. New PO(s)
may emerge from this family. The PO bifurcation is thus asso-
ciated with a vanishing curvature, or equivalently an emergence
of unit eigenvalue in the monodromy matrix.

The formation of the above local PO family may indicate a
local restoration of dynamical symmetry. In case where sys-
tem has a continuous symmetry, each PO will form a continu-
ous family generated by the symmetry transformation. Then,
the PO bifurcation may imply that a dynamical symmetry is
locally restored around the bifurcating PO and generates the
above family of POs around it. To investigate which kind of
invariance is acquired at the bifurcation point, let us consider
the phase-space function

D(Z) ≡ P(Z) − Z.

(40)

It represents the diﬀerence of successive intersections on the
phase plane Σ by a classical trajectory, and is hence determined
by the Hamiltonian ﬂow. The PO Z∗ is the zero of above func-
tion, namely, D(Z∗) = 0. If the monodromy matrix has a unit
eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector is X1, one has

D(Z∗ + cX1) = P(Z∗ + cX1) − (Z∗ + cX1)

≃ cMX1 − cX1 = 0

(41)

for small continuous parameter c. The local dynamical symme-
try is thus expressed as the invariance of D(Z) around Z∗ with
respect to the continuous transformation Z = Z∗ → Z∗ + cX1:
(42)

= 0.

The quasi-periodic family formed around the bifurcating PO
is expected to make a coherent contribution to the path integral,
and brings about a signiﬁcant shell eﬀect in case it is formed
around a short PO. Such dynamical symmetry associated with
PO bifurcation sometimes exerts signiﬁcant eﬀect on the level
statistics [17].

To examine the eﬀect of the bifurcation on the level den-
sity, it might be useful if the semiclassical formula valid also
in the vicinity of bifurcation points is available. The eﬀort of
going beyond the standard SPM to cope with the bifurcation
problem has been made in several approaches. In the uniform
approximation [18], action function is expanded up to appro-
priate higher order terms. Those higher order terms have dif-
ferent function forms depending on the type of bifurcations,

1Change in the number of solutions are generally called “bifurcation” in a

wide sense.

and one has to work out several kinds of catastrophe integrals
to obtain formula valid around those bifurcation points. In an-
other approach, the improved SPM [19, 20] is used in which
the trace integration is carried out by expanding the phase up to
a quadratic order but with keeping the exact ﬁnite integration
limits. These approaches are applied to several integrable and
non-integrable systems and succeeded in reproducing quantum
mechanical results. In the following sections, we will show that
the shell eﬀects are considerably enhanced by the eﬀect of the
bifurcations of short POs, which play quite signiﬁcant roles in
characterizing various nuclear properties.

3. The radial power-law potential model

The harmonic oscillator (HO) has been extensively used as
a simple model of the mean-ﬁeld for qualitative studies of
nuclear structures.
It nicely explains the low-energy single-
particle spectra for light nuclei. It is also useful to understand
the appearance of superdeformed shell structures. However,
heavier nuclei have sharper potential surface and it is no longer
described by the HO model. To consider the eﬀect of the sharp
surface, modiﬁed oscillator model is devised, in which a term
−vlll2 (l being orbital angular momentum vector) is added to
the HO potential. It describes the eﬀect that the energies of the
states with larger l, having major component around the sur-
face, are relatively lowered by sharpening the potential surface.
Taking also the spin-orbit coupling term −vlsl · s into account,
this model, known as the Nilsson model, is widely used as a
convenient mean ﬁeld which provides realistic single-particle
levels for nuclei [1, 2, 21]. The square-well potential, which
is further approximated by the inﬁnite-well potential, is also
used for a qualitative description of heavy nuclei. A realistic
radial proﬁle of the nuclear mean ﬁeld potential is given by
the WS model having a ﬁnite surface diﬀuseness. In this sec-
tion, we propose a radial power-law potential V(r) ∝ rα which
provides a good approximation to the WS potential and much
easier to treat in both classical and quantum mechanics than
the WS model. It includes HO and inﬁnite-well models in its
two limits α → 2 and α → ∞, respectively. We will discuss
the scaling property of the power-law potential model which is
extremely useful in the analysis of both classical and quantum
dynamics.

as

where RA and a represent the nuclear mean radius and the sur-
face diﬀuseness, respectively. The shape function f (Ω; δ) de-
scribes the angular proﬁle of the nuclear-surface shape with an-
gle variables Ω = (θ, ϕ) of the spherical coordinate and the
deformation parameter δ. For suﬃciently stable nuclei, this po-
tential can be approximated by a simpler power-law (PL) po-

Here, we use the Buck-Pilt (BP) potential V bp [22, 23], which
is essentially equivalent to the WS potential for surface diﬀuse-
ness a suﬃciently smaller than the radius RA. The advantage
of the BP in contrast with the WS is the absence of singularity
at the origin, which is not critical at the present discussion but
might be important for the analysis of classical POs intended in
the future. Figure 3 displays the radial proﬁle of the power-law
potential ﬁtted to the BP potential for several values of the mass
number A. According to the universal WS parameter given
in [25], we take the potential depth V0 = 50 MeV, the radius
RA = 1.3A1/3 fm and the surface diﬀuseness a = 0.7 fm. One
obtains α = 4 ∼ 7 corresponding to the medium to heavy nuclei
A = 50 ∼ 200. Removing the constant term in equation (44),
we deﬁne the model Hamiltonian as

Here, U0 and R0 are constants used as the units of energy and

tential depends on U0 and R0 only in a form U0/Rα
0, U0 and R0
are not necessarily independent and we put U0 = 2/mR2
0.
Our Hamiltonian (47) has the following scaling property

H(c1/2 p, c1/αr) = cH(p, r),

(48)

regardless of deformation, and the classical equations of motion
(EOM) are invariant under the scaling transformation

(r, p, t) → (c1/αr, c1/2 p, c1/α−1/2t)

(49)
with energy e → ce. This means that if r(t) is a solution of
EOM at energy e, c1/αr(c1/α−1/2t) gives a solution of EOM at

Under the existence of continuous symmetry, POs will be
generally degenerate, namely, they form continuous family
generated by the continuous symmetry transformations. In a
spherical potential, generic PO forms a three-parameter fam-
ily generated by the three independent rotations. As the ex-
ceptions, families of diameter and circle POs bear only two-
parameter degeneracy since they are mapped onto themselves
by one of the rotations.
In an axially-symmetric potential,
generic PO forms a one-parameter family generated by the ro-
tation about the symmetry axis. The two exceptions are the
diameter PO along the symmetry axis and the circle PO in the
plane perpendicular to the symmetry axis. In a system with no
continuous symmetry, all the POs are isolated. In evaluating
the trace integral with the SPM, one has the additional factor

7

K. Arita

Nuclear shell structures in terms of classical periodic orbits

proportional to 1/ √S ′′ ∝ E−1/2. Each continuous symmetry
avoids this factor and hence the contribution of K parameter
family has the energy factor EK/2 relative to those for isolated
POs. Taking account of this energy factor, semiclassical level
density of the power-law potential model is generally expressed
as

g(E) = ¯g(E) +Xβ

AβEKβ/2 cos(τβE − π

2 µβ),

(57)

with Aβ independent of energy.
In systems with continuous
symmetries, there are POs having diﬀerent degeneracies and
Kβ represents the degeneracy of the family β. The derivation of
explicit forms of the amplitude factor under various continuous
symmetries is found, e.g., in [10, 14].

3.2. Fourier transformation techniques

Due to the simple energy dependence of the action S β in the
power-law potential model, Fourier analysis of the quantum
level density provides us a useful tool to investigate classical-
quantum correspondence. Let us consider the Fourier transform
of the level density with respect to scaled energy:

F(τ) =Z dEg(E)eiτEe−(γE)2/2.

(58)

The last Gaussian factor is introduced for the energy trunca-
tion. With quantum mechanically calculated eigenvalue spec-
trum {e j}, scaled-energy level density is given by
U0!1/2+1/α

δ(E − E j), E j =  e j

g(E) =Xj

.

(59)

Inserting (59) into (58), one can evaluate F(τ) as

Fqm(τ) =Xj

eiτE je−(γE j)2/2.

On the other hand, by inserting the semiclassical level density
(57) into (58), ignoring the energy dependence of the amplitude
for simplicity, one obtains the semiclassical expression

Fcl(τ) = ¯F(τ) + πXβ

Aβe−iπµβ/2δγ(τ − τβ).

(61)

Here, δγ(x) represents the normalized Gaussian with width γ.
Equation (61) tells that F(τ) is a function having successive
peaks at the scaled periods of classical POs τ = τβ with the
corresponding heights proportional to the amplitude Aβ. Thus,
one can extract information on the contribution of classical
POs to the level density out of the quantum Fourier trans-
form (60). The present method is very useful in examining
classical-quantum correspondence, especially when the semi-
classical amplitudes are diﬃcult to obtain due to the hidden
(exact or approximate) symmetries, bifurcations and so on. To
obtain ﬁner resolution (small γ) of POs in the Fourier spectrum,
quantum spectra up to higher energy (E ∼ 1/γ) is required in
evaluating (60).

3.3. Spin-orbit coupling

It is well known that the nuclear mean ﬁeld potential has a
strong spin-orbit coupling.
In the WS model, the spin-orbit
term

λ

2(mc)2 "∇

V0

1 + exp{(r − RA f (Ω; δ))/a}# · (s × p)

(62)

is added to the central potential. In the same manner as above,
we introduce the spin-orbit term in our power-law potential
model as

H =

Vso(r) =

r

.

+ 2κ [∇Vso(r)] · (s × p), (63)

(64)

Although the spin-orbit potential almost equivalent to the cen-
tral one is used in the WS model, it might not be so bad to use
the power parameter αso a little diﬀerent from α in the central
potential (44). Here we choose αso = 1 + α/2 in order to keep
the scaling relation

Apparently, this scaling is eﬀective only for frozen-spin mo-
tions where spin vector is static. Fortunately, spin is frozen in
many important POs, and the above scaling turns out to be very
useful in our semiclassical analysis. The spin-orbit coupling
strength κ is determined so that the spin-orbit potential in the
spherical limit takes the same value as that of the realistic WS
model at the nuclear surface r = RA. The potential parame-
ters obtained for several values of mass number A are shown
in table 1. We obtain κ = 0.05 ∼ 0.06 α = 5.0 ∼ 6.0 for
medium-mass region A = 50 ∼ 150.
The EOM for the classical spin variables are derived by
the spin coherent-state path integral method [26]. One useful
choice of the canonical variables for the spin degree of free-
dom is qs = ϕ and ps = s cos ϑ, where ϑ and ϕ are polar and
azimuthal angles in the spherical spin coordinates, respectively.
The Cartesian spin components are given by

sx = s sin ϑ cos ϕ,
sy = s sin ϑ sin ϕ,
sz = s cos ϑ,

(66a)
(66b)
(66c)

with the modulus s constant (s = /2 for nucleon). One can
prove the Poisson bracket relation between the classical spin

which exactly corresponds to the commutation relation of the
quantum spin operators. The trace formula in extended phase
space including the spin degree of freedom is formulated in
[27].

Writing B = ∇Vso(r) × p, classical EOM is expressed as

(68c)

Let us consider the case where the potentials V (Vc and Vso) are
axially symmetric. Frozen-spin orbits appear under the follow-
ing conditions:

1. Meridian and equatorial orbits

Taking z axis as the symmetry axis of rotation, consider a
classical trajectory starting with r and p both on the merid-
ian plane (the plane containing the symmetry axis), say,
the (x, z) plane, and s perpendicular to it, namely, in the
y direction. On the (x, z) plane, ∇V is perpendicular to
the y axis and then the vector B is parallel to the y axis.
Consequently, the y-components of all the terms in the
right-hand sides of equations (68a) and (68b) as well as
the right-hand side of (68c) vanish, and the trajectory is
shown to remain in the (x, z) plane with its spin frozen.
Hence one has the meridian-plane frozen-spin orbits. If
the potential is also symmetric with respect to the (x, y)
plane (equatorial plane), the classical orbits in this plane
with spin perpendicular to it are shown just as above to be
frozen-spin orbits.

2. Diameter orbits

Consider a trajectory starting along the symmetry axis (z
axis) with spin parallel to the z axis. On the symme-
try axis, ∇V is parallel to the z axis and hence B = 0.
Thus one easily sees from the EOM (68) that the trajec-
tory remains on the z axis with spin frozen, and one has
the frozen-spin diameter PO along the symmetry axis. If
the potential is symmetric with respect to the (x, y) plane,
one ﬁnds just as above the frozen-spin diameter orbits in
the equatorial plane with the spin parallel to the orbital
motion.

The reduced EOM for the frozen-spin PO in the orbital plane
have the same invariance against scaling transformation (48),
and the action integral along the orbit is expressed as

Iβ(e)

p · dr = τβE.

(69)

Because of this simple energy dependence, equivalent to the
case without spin-orbit coupling, contributions of those POs
to the level density can be also studied conveniently with the
Fourier transformation technique.

There is another semiclassical method to treat the spin degree
of freedom, by making use of the coupled-channel WKB for-
malism [28–31], where the spin is considered as a slow variable

Nuclear shell structures in terms of classical periodic orbits

in contrast to the orbital motion and the adiabatic approxima-
tion is applied. The Hamiltonian matrix of (2×2) spin channels
is diagonalized to obtain two adiabatic Hamiltonians, and the
classical POs in those two Hamiltonians determine the semi-
classical level density. It should be noted that the frozen-spin
POs in our approach are equivalent to those obtained for the di-
abatic representations of Hamiltonians in the coupled-channel
WKB method [30].

4. Nuclear magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry

Nuclear binding energies as functions of the particle number
show remarkable ﬂuctuation properties similar to those in the
ionization potentials of atoms. They are both manifestation of
the shell structures for the quantized independent motion of
constituent particles in the mean ﬁelds.
In nuclear systems,
quite distinct magic numbers are known for both protons and
neutrons:

N, Z = 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126, ·· · ,

(70)

for which nuclei show the extreme stabilities. These numbers
are successfully explained by the mean-ﬁeld model with strong
spin-orbit coupling, like Nilsson (modiﬁed oscillator) and WS
potential models.

An approximate dynamical symmetry called pseudospin [or
pseudo SU(3)] symmetry plays role in this shell structure
[32–34]. In the so-called pseudospin transformation, angular
momentum quantum numbers are reassigned as ˜l = l ± 1 for
j = l ± 1
2 levels. The Nilsson Hamiltonian is transformed cor-
respondingly as

HNils = HHO − vlsl · s − vlll2
→ ˜HNils = ˜HHO − (4vll − vls)˜l · ˜s − vll˜l2

− (2vll − vls).

(71)
Since the relation vls ≈ 4vll holds well, spin-orbit coupling is
quenched in the pseudospin representation, and one ﬁnds sys-
tematic degeneracies of the pseudo spin-orbit partners ( ˜j =
˜l ± 1
2 ). The same kind of level degeneracies are also found
in more realistic WS potential model, where the splittings of
degenerate HO levels due to the sharp potential surface are par-
tially compensated by the spin-orbit coupling. Those quench-
ing of the pseudo spin-orbit splitting is considered as a result
of approximate dynamical symmetry restoration, and might be
understood in relation to the PO bifurcations as discussed in
section 2.3.

In the power-law potential model, surface diﬀuseness is con-
trolled by the power parameter α, and the above development
of gross shell structure can be studied as the combinatory eﬀect
of the power parameter α and the spin-orbit coupling strength
κ. Figure 4 shows the single-particle level diagram which plots
single-particle scaled energies as functions of the spin-orbit pa-
rameter κ. The power parameter is taken as α = 5.0 correspond-
ing to the medium-mass nuclei. Systematic degeneracies of
levels are found around the realistic value of spin-orbit strength
κ ≈ 0.05, where a gross shell eﬀect is considerably developed.
Level crossings of the pseudo spin-orbit partners are indicated
by open dots. They occur at almost the same values of κ and
aﬀect the gross shell structure. The magic numbers (70) are
correctly reproduced there.

potential model with the power parameter α = 5.0. Scaled-energy
levels E j = (e j/U0)1/2+1/α are plotted as functions of the spin-orbit

where all the levels below the energy gap are occupied, are indicated
in italics. Full and broken lines represent positive and negative par-
ity levels, respectively. Open dots indicate the level crossings of the
pseudo spin-orbit partners ˜j = ˜l ± 1/2.

As discussed in section 3.2, one can extract information on
PO contributions from the Fourier transform of scaled-energy
level density (60). Figure 5 shows the moduli of Fourier trans-
form |F(τ; κ)| as functions of τ, for several values of the spin-
orbit parameter κ. As expected from equation (61), the Fourier
amplitude shows successive peaks at the scaled periods of clas-
sical POs τ = τβ. For κ = 0, one ﬁnds peaks at τ = 5.1 and 5.8,
which correspond to the diameter orbit (2,1) and the circle orbit
C, respectively. We label the POs by the number of oscillation
nr in radial direction and number of rotations nϕ about the ori-
gin, and express them as (nr, nϕ). The number of radial oscilla-
tions cannot be assigned to the circle PO and we denote it as C.
With increasing spin-orbit parameter κ, the diameter orbit (2,1)
is deformed into an oval shape, and the circle orbit C bifurcates
into C+ and C− having orbital angular momentum parallel and
anti-parallel to the spin. At κ ≃ 0.05, the circle orbit C+ under-
goes bifurcation and a new orbit (3,1) of triangular-type shape
emerges. These POs at κ = 0.06 are displayed in ﬁgure 6. As
shown in the top panel of ﬁgure 5, the contribution of the or-
bits C+ and (3,1) is strongly enhanced at κ = 0.06. This is
considered as the PO bifurcation enhancement eﬀect which we
discussed in section 2.2. Consequently, the semiclassical origin
of the development of remarkable shell structure at α = 5.0 and
κ = 0.05, corresponding to medium-mass nuclei, is shown to
be related to the emergence of the orbit (3,1) bifurcated from
C+ and the associated local dynamical symmetry.

The contribution of unfrozen orbit cannot be investigated by
the Fourier analysis because of the absence of the scaling, and
one can only study it by directly evaluating the semiclassical

level density. If the quantum level density is reproduced only
with the contribution of frozen-spin orbits, one may consider
that the eﬀect of unfrozen orbits can be omitted. Let us consider
the oscillating part of the coarse-grained scaled-energy level
density with the averaging width γ,

The exponential damping factor e−(γτβ)2 /4 in (72), which ap-
pears due to the coarse-graining, suppresses the contribution of
longer POs. Hence, the sum is dominated only by some short-
est POs. We know the scaled periods τβ and the degeneracies
Kβ, but unfortunately we have not succeeded in obtaining the
semiclassical amplitudes Aβ as well as Maslov indices µβ. For
the present, we shall treat Aβ and µβ as free parameters and de-
termine them by the least square ﬁtting to the quantum level
density. Figure 7 shows the result for α = 5.0 and κ = 0.06.
We take account of the contributions of four shortest frozen-
spin POs; (2,1), C± and (3,1). In the upper panel, we compare
the quantum level density with the semiclassical ﬁtting. One
will see that the quantum shell structure and its beating pat-
tern are precisely reproduced. This seems to manifest that the
PO sum is dominated mostly by the contribution of frozen-spin
POs. In the lower panel, contributions of individual POs are
shown, and one will see that the bifurcating orbits C++(3,1)
play the dominant role in this shell structure, as indicated in
the Fourier spectra (ﬁgure 5). Interference with the contribu-
tions of the other POs makes the beating pattern. Particularly,
one sees that the distinct magic numbers in the medium-mass
region, N = 50, 82, 128, are established according to the con-
structive interference eﬀect of those POs.

We have also found that the above (3, 1) bifurcation play sig-
niﬁcant roles in the quadrupole deformed shell structures. It
might be an interesting subject to examine the role of the spin-
orbit coupling for the properties of the deformed shell struc-
tures and their relations to the pseudo-spin symmetry in de-
formed nuclei [34–36].

5. Bifurcations of classical periodic orbits and nuclear ex-

otic deformations

In the classical regime, self-bound interacting many-body sys-
tem favors the spherical shape, since the system prefers the
shape whose surface area is as smaller as possible under the
ﬁxed volume. In the quantum regime, the quantum shell ef-
fects evoke various deformations to the system. These shell
eﬀects are caused by the ﬂuctuation in the single-particle spec-
tra. Nuclei show particular stability at the spherical shape when
the levels under the energy gap are completely occupied. The
magic numbers (70) correspond to such closed-shell conﬁgu-
rations. In situation where the degenerate levels at the Fermi
energy are partially occupied, system tends to deform in order
to lower the energy by splitting the degenerate levels by defor-
mation, as illustrated in ﬁgure 8. The way of the level splittings
depends on the types of the deformations, and such shape that
makes the level density at the Fermi energy lower is preferred.

spontaneous symmetry breaking. Solid lines represent single-particle
levels and dots denote particles in the highest partially-occupied levels.
Broken line indicate Fermi energy. The self-bound system prefers the
shape which makes level density at Fermi surface as low as possible
to make the largest shell energy gain.

It is a kind of spontaneous breaking of symmetry similar to
the Jahn-Teller eﬀect known in the molecular systems. In this
section, we discuss some nuclear exotic deformations and their
semiclassical origins with the use of the POT.

5.1. Superdeformations

Concerning nuclear deformations, one of the most exciting dis-
covery is the so-called superdeformed states in rapidly rotating
nuclei, having extremely large quadrupole deformation whose
axis ratio amounts to 2:1 [37, 38]. Nuclei with such large
deformations are also found in the ﬁssion process as isomers
formed between the double-humped potential barriers [39, 40].
The search of the second minima having much larger defor-
mation whose axis ratio close to 3:1, often referred to as hy-
perdeformed states, is also a hot subject in the high-spin nu-
clear physics for both theories and experiments [41]. For such
large deformations to be realized, signiﬁcant shell energy gain
should be provided particularly at those shapes in addition to
the macroscopic driving force like Coulomb repulsion and ro-
tation.

In the following, let us investigate the emergence of the su-
perdeformed shell structures and their semiclassical origins.
Here, we neglect the spin-orbit coupling for simplicity. The
simplest model for describing the superdeformed shell struc-
ture is the axially-symmetric harmonic oscillator (HO)

and the simultaneous degeneracies of levels take places where
the frequencies ω⊥ and ωz become commensurable. Figure 9
displays the single-particle level diagram, in which the energy
eigenvalues are plotted as functions of the deformation param-
eter δ = log(ω⊥/ωz). Particularly, one sees prominent shell
structures at eδ = 2±1 (δ = ±0.693) and eδ = 3±1 (δ = ±1.099),
which correspond to the superdeformed and hyperdeformed
shapes, respectively.

In semiclassical POT, those shell structures are understood as
the result of the emergence of the four-parametric PO families

at the deformations with rational frequency ratios. Typical POs
at those deformations are shown in the top of ﬁgure 9. In the
HO model, these degenerate PO families can exist only at the
deformations with rational axis ratios.

On the other hand, realistic nuclear mean ﬁeld potential has
sharper surface with increasing mass number. Let us consider
the deformed shell structure in the radial power-law potential
model with spheroidal deformation, where the shape function

f (θ; δ) =

This model is integrable in the two limits: α = 2 (axially de-
formed HO) and α = ∞ (spheroidal cavity), and nearly inte-
grable between them: a large portion of the classical phase
space is foliated with the KAM tori. Figure 10 shows the
single-particle level diagram of the power-law potential model
with the power parameter α = 5.0. One ﬁnds level bunchings
around the superdeformed region |δ| ∼ 0.7 although they are
less clear compared with the case of HO.
Let us analyze the properties of classical POs in the
spheroidal power-law potential to investigate the classical-
quantum correspondence. In the HO limit, α = 2, all the classi-
cal motions are periodic at the spherical shape (δ = 0). Varying
α from the HO value, only the circle and diameter POs sur-
vive.
If the potential is deformed into spheroidal shape, the
circle PO family bifurcate into the meridian oval family C and
the isolated equatorial circle EC. The diameter PO also bifur-
cate into the degenerate equatorial diameter family X and the
isolated symmetry-axis diameter Z. Figure 11 shows the scaled
periods of those classical POs for several values of α as func-
tions of the deformation parameter δ. With increasing prolate
deformation δ > 0, the meridian oval orbit C is continuously
deformed and ﬁnally submerge into symmetry-axis diameter Z
at certain deformation δc. With increasing oblate deformation
δ < 0, the orbit C is deformed in a diﬀerent way and ﬁnally sub-
merge into the equatorial diameter X at the deformation −δc.
In this way, the oval orbit family C make a bridge between the
two bifurcations from the diameter orbits X and Z with vary-
ing deformation. We call such kind of bifurcation scenario as

Figure 12. Illustration of the bridge-orbit bifurcation scenario. Bro-
ken lines represent S (q), the action integral along the closed orbit starts
from q and returns to the same point q, at several deformations in the
bifurcation process. Stationary points of S (q) give the POs. With vary-
ing deformation δ, a bridge orbit B emerges from the orbit P and then
submerge into the orbit Q. A family of quasi-periodic orbits is formed
around the shaded area. Full lines drawn in the (δ, S ) plane are the ac-
tion integrals along the POs, and dots indicate the bifurcation points.

the bridge orbit bifurcation. The classical and semiclassical
analyses of the bridge orbit bifurcations are given in [42] with
various practical examples. It should be emphasized that the
two orbits connected by the bridge are widely separated from
each other in the phase space. If the bridge is short enough in
the deformation space, the dynamical symmetry restored at one
end of the bridge will be approximately kept along the bridge to
the other end, and it may bring about a family of quasi-periodic
orbits occupying much larger phase space volume than that in
case of simple bifurcations.

Figure 12 illustrates the scenario of the bridge-orbit bifurca-

tion:

(i) There are two diﬀerent POs, P and Q, corresponding to the
two stationary points of the action function S (q), which
are widely separated from each other.

(ii) With increasing deformation δ, the orbit P undergoes bi-
furcation and a new orbit B emerges from it. One ﬁnds
a family of quasi-periodic orbits around these stationary
points.

(iii) Action integrals of P and Q orbits crosses in the (δ, S )
plane, and the quasi-periodic family extends from P to
Q, implying a development of large dynamical symmetry
around them.

(iv) The orbit B approaches the orbit Q and
(v) ﬁnally submerges into the orbit Q.

In comparison to the simple bifurcations which may cause
local dynamical symmetries only in vicinity of the single bifur-
cating PO, we could expect the bridge orbit to give much more
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the quantum shell eﬀect due to the large
phase-space volume of the quasi-periodic orbit family formed
around the bridge orbits. From ﬁgure 11, one will note that
existence domain (−δc, δc) for the bridge orbit C grows as the
power parameter α becomes larger. The contribution of bridge
orbit might be less important as the above domain grows due to

the breaking of the dynamical symmetry between the two ends
of the bridge, and thus, shell eﬀect is generally reduced as α
increases.

To investigate the contribution of these orbits to the level
density, we calculate the Fourier transforms of the scaled-
energy level density (60). Figure 13 shows the Fourier ampli-
tudes |F(τ; δ)| plotted in the (δ, τ) plane. The power parameter
α = 3.0, a little larger than the HO value, is taken as an illustra-
tion. The scaled period τβ(δ) of the classical POs are also drawn
in the same plane. One ﬁnds an excellent correspondence be-
tween Fourier peaks and the classical POs. The Fourier am-
plitudes take especially large values along the bridge orbits ap-
pearing at each crossings of the repetitions of the equatorial
and symmetry axis orbits. One may also note that the Fourier
amplitudes along the orbit nX (n th repetition of X) are larger
than those along the orbit nZ. This is because the orbit X forms
a one-parametric family with respect to the rotation about the
symmetry axis, while the orbit Z is isolated. In the superde-
formed region δ ≈ 0.6, the bridge orbits between the second
repetition of equatorial orbits and the primitive symmetry-axis
orbit play important role.

In ﬁgure 14, we examine the Fourier spectra in superde-
formed region in detail taking the power parameter α = 5.0
suitable for medium-mass nuclei. In the superdeformed region,
the equatorial diameter X undergoes period-doubling bifurca-
tion at δ = 0.46 and a pair of stable and unstable meridian or-

bits (2,1)s and (2,1)u emerge. Here, the meridian orbits in the
(x, z) plane are labeled by the numbers of oscillations in x and
z directions (nx, nz). The above meridian orbits change their
shapes with increasing δ, and ﬁnally, (2,1)u submerge into the
symmetry-axis orbit Z at δ = 0.97, and (2,1)s submerge into
Z at δ = 1.28. Namely, there are two bridge orbits between
equatorial diameter and symmetry-axis orbit. One also sees
another bridge orbit between the second repetition of equato-
rial circle orbit 2EC and symmetry-axis orbit Z around a little
larger deformation. The orbit EC undergoes period-doubling
bifurcation at δ = 0.69 and a new three-dimensional (3D) or-
bit (2,2,1) emerges. 3D orbits are labeled by the numbers of
oscillations (rotations) (nρ, nϕ, nz) in the directions of the cylin-
drical coordinate (ρ, ϕ, z). With increasing δ, the orbit (2,2,1)
ﬁrst submerge into meridian orbit (2,1)s (the stable branch of
the meridian bridges) at δ = 0.95 before ﬁnally submerge into
the orbit Z at δ = 1.28. One sees Fourier amplitude greatly
enhanced along these bridge orbits and they should play most
signiﬁcant roles in emergence of superdeformed shell structure.
Next, let us evaluate the shell energies δE(N) as functions
of deformation, and examine the eﬀect of above bifurcations.
Suppose the situation where a single orbit β dominates the PO
sum in equation (31), namely,

strong oscillations in δE(N) to develop around δ ≈ 0.6, which
is considered as the eﬀect of the superdeformed shell struc-
ture. Thick curves represent the constant-action lines (80) of
some short classical POs. Shell energy valleys in the region
δ = 0.4 ∼ 0.6 are nicely explained by the meridian (2,1) bridge
orbits, and those in the region δ = 0.7 ∼ 0.9 are by the 3D
orbit (2,2,1), just as expected from Fourier analysis. Hence,
we can conclude that the bridge orbit bifurcations between the
second repetition of equatorial and the primitive symmetry-axis
orbits are responsible for the emergence of superdeformed shell
structure. This is a general consequence valid for any value of
α from HO to cavity values [43], any other parametrization of
quadrupole shapes, with and without spin-orbit coupling [44].

ground states, and the violation of this fundamental symmetry
may provide us with valuable information on the nuclear dy-
namics. As reviewed in [45], several static octupole-deformed
states have been observed, e.g., through the low-lying negative
parity states and the parity-doublet rotational bands connected
with E1 and E3 transitions. It is also predicted that the excited
rotational states have quite unique nature when they are build
on the ground state having an octupole shape with the point
group symmetry such as the tetrahedral one [46]. Since no
driving forces towards reﬂection-asymmetric shapes are found
in the classical dynamics, quantum shell eﬀects are considered
as the exclusive origin of the octupole deformations.

The reﬂection asymmetries are also important in description
of the asymmetric ﬁssion processes of heavy elements [39,47].
The semiclassical POT is also useful in accounting for the for-
mation of ﬁssion path towards the reﬂection-asymmetric shapes
[48].

Hamamoto et al have investigated the octupole deformed
shell structures by considering four kinds of pure octupole de-
formations added to the spherical potential [49]. They found a
remarkable shell structure develops at ﬁnite Y32-type deforma-
tion which has the tetrahedral Td symmetry. The importance of
the tetrahedral deformation is also discussed for nuclei [50, 51]
and metallic clusters [52]. Here we are going to extend the
analysis of [49] to a more realistic power-law potential model
and investigate the semiclassical origins of octupole-deformed
shell structures. There are several ways of parametrizing oc-
tupole shapes. In the WS model, the shape of the equi-potential
surface is usually parametrized as

r =R0(1 + β3m ˜Y3m),

˜Y3m = p2 − δm0 Re Y3m.

V(r) =

0r2
mω2
2

h1 − 2β3m ˜Y3mi .

(81a)

(81b)

(82)

In the modiﬁed oscillator model employed by [49], octupole
potential is introduced in addition to the spherical central po-
tential as

In this case, the shape of the equi-potential surface is expressed
as

r = R0[1 − 2β3m ˜Y3m]−1/2.

Above parametrizations can be generalized to a formula

r = R0[1 + kβ3m ˜Y3m]1/k

(83)

(84)

which corresponds to (81) for k = 1 and to (83) for k = −2, re-
spectively. This generalized formula gives the identical shape
independent of k up to the ﬁrst order of β3m, while it gives con-
siderably diﬀerent shapes dependent on k for large β3m. To
obtain the optimum shape parametrization, we consider min-
imization of the area of the equi-potential surface with respect
to k under the ﬁxed volume surrounded by the surface. For
a given β3m with varying k, the surface area is found to take
minimum around k = 0. Hence we take the k → 0 limit of
equation (84), which results in an exponential function. Then,
our Hamiltonian is expressed as

Figure 16. Equi-potential surfaces for octupole deformed potentials

R0(β3m) is determined by the volume conservation condition.

Figure 16 displays the equi-potential surfaces for four types
of purely octupole-deformed potentials at the octupole param-
eters β3m = 0.4. Y30 shape has a continuous axial symmetry,
while the other shapes have diﬀerent kinds of discrete point-
group symmetries [53, 54]. Those symmetries can be utilized
in quantum calculations to classify the eigenstates according to
the irreps (irreducible representations) of the symmetry group.
The Y31 and Y33 shapes have C2v and D3h symmetries, respec-
tively, which have up to two-dimensional irreps. The Y32 shape
has the tetrahedral (Td) symmetry consists of 24 diﬀerent sym-
metric transformations and has three-dimensional irreps. Since
the degeneracy factor of the levels is equal to the dimension of
the irrep, one generally ﬁnd levels with three-fold degeneracies
in the Y32-deformed states. Due to this higher degeneracies, the
Y32 deformed states are expected to have stronger shell eﬀect
than those with the other types of octupole shapes.

In addition to the above geometrical degeneracy eﬀect,
Hamamoto et al have found a strong bunching of levels for ﬁ-
nite Y32 deformation, and the shell-energy gains with Y32 de-
formation may surpass those with quadrupole deformations in
certain particle number regions.

Figure 17 shows the single-particle level diagram with the
power parameter α = 6.0, where the single-particle scaled en-
ergies E j are plotted as functions of Y32-deformation parameter
β32. The degenerate levels at the spherical shape split with in-
creasing octupole deformation, but they eventually form a pro-
nounced shell structure around β32 = 0.4. Surprisingly, the
particle numbers corresponding to the closed-shell conﬁgura-
tions are equivalent to those of spherical HO model [52]. Al-
though the obtained shell eﬀects here are not as strong as what
we have obtained in [55] using the shape parametrization inter-
polating sphere and tetrahedron, qualitative features are quite
similar. One ﬁnds no such remarkable shell structures for the
other types of octupole shapes.

In ﬁgure 18, we compare deformed shell energies for dif-
ferent types of octupole shapes, taking the power parameter
α = 6.0. Shell energies δE(N) are plotted as functions of the

ters. For small β3m, shell energies show supershell structures
due to the interference of two groups of the POs: ones bi-
furcated from the circle orbit and the others from the diame-
ter orbit. As the octupole deformation parameter increase, the
ﬂuctuations in shell energies show diﬀerent structures and am-
plitudes for diﬀerent types of deformation. One ﬁnds that the
gross shell eﬀects are remarkably enhanced for the Y32 defor-
mation: It shows quite regular oscillations and are most de-
veloped around β32 = 0.4, as expected from the level diagram
shown in ﬁgure 17.

octupole deformation parameters β3m = 0, 0.2 and 0.4. For the
spherical shape β3m = 0, one sees two prominent peaks at τ =

respectively. These peaks rapidly decreases with increasing β3m
for m , 2, while the peak at τ ∼ 6.0 remains large for Y32
deformation. At β32 ∼ 0.4, this peak is enhanced again and one
might expect that the corresponding PO will make signiﬁcant
contribution to the level density at this deformation.

To elucidate the origin of the emergence of this remarkable
shell structure associated with Y32 deformation, we examine in
ﬁgure 20 the correspondence between the distribution of the
Fourier peaks and the scaled-periods of the classical POs in the
(β32, τ) plane. Some shortest POs are displayed in ﬁgure 21

for β32 = 0.2. Here, we name each PO with two characters:
The ﬁrst character “D”, “P” or “T” stands for diameter, planar
or three-dimensional; the second one is put alphabetically in
the order we’ve found them. With increasing β32, the diame-
ter orbit bifurcates into four diﬀerent orbits: the diameter DA
along the three-fold rotation axis, the diameter DB along the
four-fold rotatory reﬂection axis, librational orbits PA and PB
in the mirror-symmetry plane. From the Fourier analysis, their
contributions to the level density are monotonically reduced
with increasing β32. The circle orbit bifurcates into three or-
bits: the isosceles triangular-type orbit PC in the mirror plane,
the equilateral triangular-type orbit TA having three-fold rota-
tional symmetry, and the square-type orbit TB having four-fold
rotatory reﬂection symmetry. The orbit PC undergoes bifurca-
tion at β32 = 0.035 from which a 3D orbit TC emerges. The
orbits TA and TC undergo so-called touch-and-go bifurcation
at β32 = 0.11. As a common property in these three orbits, the
monodromy matrix has an eigenvalue which is kept close to
unity up to large values of β32. As we discussed in section 2.3
a local family of quasi-periodic orbit is formed around such an
orbit and it makes coherent contribution to the trace integral.
This explains the reason why the contribution of these orbits
remain large with increasing β32. They undergo bifurcations
almost simultaneously around β32 ∼ 0.3 and yields new POs,
some of which make bridges between them. As we see in ﬁg-
ures 19 and 20, signiﬁcant enhancement of the Fourier peak
corresponding to those bifurcations is found. Some details on
these bifurcations are described in the appendix. Since these
orbits have almost the same values of scaled periods τβ, they
bring about a quite regular shell structure. The approximate
coincidence of their actions and the almost simultaneous occur-
rence of bifurcations generating the bridge-orbit networks con-
necting them strongly suggest the underlying dynamical sym-
metry. This symmetry restoration, caused almost simultane-
ously around many diﬀerent POs and also mapped onto their
replicas generated by the 24 symmetry transformations of Td,
is considered to develop into in somewhat global one. Recall-
ing the magic numbers at β32 ≈ 0.4 shown in ﬁgure 17 which
are equivalent to those of spherical HO, one may surmise that
a restoration of the dynamical symmetry like SU(3) takes place
for the above speciﬁc combination of surface diﬀuseness and
tetrahedral-type octupole deformation. It raises an interesting
question on the relation between the symmetry restoration and
the tetrahedral deformation, and further studies are necessary
to clarify it.

6. Nuclear prolate-shape dominance

Predominance of prolate shapes in nuclear ground-state defor-
mation (which is referred to as prolate dominance for short) is a
long-standing problem of nuclear structure physics [1]. Only a
few oblate ground states are found experimentally in medium to
heavy nuclei. The microscopic mean-ﬁeld theories also support
this feature [56]. In this section, we try to explain this peculiar
property of nuclei from the semiclassical point of view with a
realistic nuclear mean ﬁeld model taking account of spin-orbit
coupling.

Nuclear shell structures in terms of classical periodic orbits

6.1. Some earlier studies and remaining problems

and the constant action lines behave as

Various approaches have been attempted aiming at a simple in-
terpretation of the prolate dominance in nuclear ground-state
deformations. It is generally recognized that the surface prop-
erty of the mean-ﬁeld potential has relevance to the deformed
shell structures responsible for the prolate dominance. The
surface of the mean ﬁeld potential becomes sharper with in-
creasing mass number. The transition of the deformed shell
structure from light to heavy nuclei are studied by Strutinsky
et al [11] using the WS potential model with spheroidal de-
formation. The deformation is parametrized by the axis ratio
η = Rz/R⊥ where Rz and R⊥(= Rx = Ry) are semiaxes of the
nuclear surface. They calculated the shell energy δE(N; η) as
functions of deformation η and the particle number N, and in-
vestigated its ridge-valley structures in the (η, N) plane. For
the prolate deformation (η > 1), the shell energy valleys have
positive slopes in small N region while they turn into negative
slopes in large N region. Such transition has been successfully
explained using the POT. For small N, the surface diﬀuseness
a is comparable with the nuclear radius RA and the WS po-
tential can be approximated by the anisotropic HO potential
(74). Imposing the volume conservation condition ω2
⊥ωz = ω3
0,
the oscillator frequencies are given as functions of axis ratio
η = ω⊥/ωz by

ω⊥ = ω0η1/3,
ωz = ω0η−2/3.

(86a)
(86b)

In the normal deformation region, the two-parametric shortest
equatorial orbit family makes the dominant contribution to the
periodic-orbit sum. Its action integral is expressed as

S β(E; η) =

2πE
ω⊥(η)

=

2πE
ω0η1/3 .

Then, the constant-action lines (80) behave as

N(∝ E3

F) ∝ η

(87)

(88)

and they have positive slopes in the (η, N) plane. On the other
hand, for large N, the surface diﬀuseness is much smaller
than the nuclear radius and the WS potential looks more like
a square-well potential, and it might be further approximated
by the inﬁnite-well (cavity) potential. In the spheroidal cavity,
shortest equatorial orbits form a one-parametric family, while
the meridian-plane orbits form a two-parametric family due to
the speciﬁc symmetry of the system. Therefore, the merid-
ian orbit families (triangular, quadrangular, ...) make dominant
contributions to the PO sum. Imposing the volume conserva-
tion condition R2
0, the semi-axes Ri of the equi-potential
⊥
surface are given by

Rz = R3

R⊥(= Rx = Ry) = R0η−1/3,
Rz = R0η2/3,

(89a)
(89b)

and the length Lβ of the meridian orbit, say, rhomboidal orbit is
estimated as

N(∝ p3

F) ∝

η

(1 + η2)3/2 ,

(92)

which have negative slopes in the prolate region η > 1.

The semiclassical analysis of spheroidal cavity has been
thoroughly worked out by Frisk [57] using the Berry-Tabor
trace formula. The quantum mechanical shell energies are suc-
cessfully reproduced by the semiclassical formula as the sum
over PO contributions. He has remarked that the curves (92) in
the oblate region η < 1 are rather ﬂat, and correspondingly, the
shell energy valleys running along them are also ﬂat. Hence, no
signiﬁcant shell-energy gains are expected with oblate defor-
mations as nucleon numbers deviated from the spherical magic
numbers. This explains the mechanism of the prolate domi-
nance very nicely.

Hamamoto and Mottelson [58] have discussed the origin of
the prolate dominance from a diﬀerent point of view. They
compared the behaviors of the single-particle levels against de-
formation in the cases of the HO and cavity (inﬁnite well) po-
tential models. In axially deformed HO potential, the degener-
ate levels at the spherical shape fan out freely with increasing
deformation on both prolate and oblate sides. This is because
the shell oscillator number is a good quantum number in the
HO model and interactions between levels from diﬀerent major
shells are absent. On the other hand, there are interactions be-
tween inter-shell levels in the cavity potential, and they aﬀect
the way of level fannings. Their behavior on the prolate and
oblate sides show obvious asymmetry: the fannings of levels
in the oblate side are considerably suppressed in comparison
to the prolate side. Hamamoto and Mottelson have compared
the eﬀects of the interactions between inter-shell levels on the
prolate and oblate sides, and clariﬁed the reason why the level
fannings show the above asymmetric behaviors on the prolate
and oblate sides. The suppression of level fannings in the oblate
side might reduce the chance to acquire a reasonable shell en-
ergy gain by oblate deformation. They considered the above
asymmetry in level splittings as the origin of the prolate domi-
nance.

Still there remain some questions to be answered. Firstly,
from the semiclassical point of view, the deformations are es-
sentially determined by the shell energy in which only short
POs make contribution, and they are related to the gross shell
structures. However, the way of level splittings might be re-
lated to rather ﬁne structures of levels. One should consider
this aspect more carefully. Secondly, as suggested by Tajima et
al [59,60], prolate dominance shows strong correlation with the
strength of spin-orbit coupling, as well as the surface diﬀuse-
ness of the potential. The eﬀect of spin-orbit coupling has not
been studied in the above works. The argument of [58] applies
to the case of realistic spin-orbit coupling where one ﬁnds the
same kind of prolate-oblate asymmetry in the level fannings,
but it cannot explain the oscillation in the prolate dominance
with varying spin-orbit strength which Tajima et al have found.
Let us consider these issues in the following part.

6.2. Gross shell structures in the power-law potential models

First, let us generalize the above analyses to a model having a
more realistic radial dependence with ﬁnite diﬀuseness. Spin-
orbit coupling is set aside for the moment. In [24], we have

made analysis of the spherical and deformed shell structures
for the power-law potential V ∝ rα with varying the power pa-
rameter α. For α = 2, corresponding to the HO potential, level
splitting occur in the same uniform way on both prolate and
oblate sides. The shell energy valleys in the (δ, N) plain have
almost the same upward-right slopes on both sides. With in-
creasing α, the suppression of level fannings on the oblate side
manifests. Figure 22 shows the level fannings of some high- j
levels. In the upper panel for the power parameter α = 5.0,
corresponding to medium-mass nuclei, one clearly sees a re-
markable suppression of level fannings on the oblate side. In
the lower panel, a calculation for α = 1.1 (although it is an un-
realistic value for any nucleus) is made, in which one ﬁnds a
suppression of level fannings on the prolate side, just as oppo-
site to the case of α > 2.

Figure 23 shows the contour maps of the shell energy
δE(N; δ) plotted as a function of deformation δ and particle
number N for the above two values of the power parameter α.
Thick curves represent the constant action curves (80) of the
POs which make dominant contribution to the trace formula
(31). As we see in ﬁgure 11, the oval shape meridian-plane
orbit family C exists as the bridge orbit between equatorial di-
ameter orbit X and symmetry-axis diameter orbit Z. This bridge
orbit makes signiﬁcant contribution to the level density as ex-
pected from the Fourier spectra in ﬁgure 13. In the upper panel
of ﬁgure 23 for α = 5.0, one ﬁnds that the constant-action lines
(80) for the orbit C nicely explain the shell energy valleys in
the normal deformation region. The slopes of the curves are
steep in the prolate side while they are rather ﬂat in the oblate
side. This behavior of the shell energy valleys formed along
the bridge orbit C can be considered as the semiclassical ori-
gin of the prolate dominance. Thus, one sees that the argument
of [57] for the spheroidal cavity model can be generalized to
more realistic potentials.

and its origin is clearly understood as the contribution of short
classical POs. Correlation between the level fannings and the
shape dominance is missing in the case of α = 1.1. This might
be because the level fannings are related to rather ﬁner shell
structure associated with the contribution of longer POs and
their roles in the shell energies (31) are less important.

(95)

6.3. Eﬀect of spin-orbit coupling

Figure 24 compares the deformation energy minima Edef(δmin)
on the prolate and oblate sides for several values of the power
parameter α. δmin is the deformation parameter where the de-
formation energy (93) takes minimum on each of the prolate
and oblate side. For α = 2.0 (HO), the lower half of the shell
prefer prolate shapes while the upper half prefer oblate shapes,
and the numbers of prolate and oblate minima are comparable.
For α = 5.0 where the potential surface is considerably sharper
than HO, prolate minima turn systematically lower than oblate
ones and they clearly show the prolate dominance. For α = 1.1,
where one sees the suppression of level fannings on the pro-
late side which may imply oblate-shape dominance, no essen-
tial diﬀerence between prolate and oblate minima are found in
the deformation energies. Looking at the shell energy contour
plot for α = 1.1 shown in the lower panel of ﬁgure 23, one
sees that the constant-action lines for the orbit C have consid-
erably large slopes on the prolate side as well as on the oblate
side. These constant-action lines nicely explain the behavior
of the shell-energy valleys, for which no remarkable prolate-
oblate asymmetry is expected.

To summarize above results,

the prolate dominance is
strongly correlated with the behavior of shell energy valleys,

Next, let us consider the eﬀect of spin-orbit coupling. By means
of the systematic Strutinsky calculations over the whole nu-
clear chart, Tajima et al examined the occurrence of the pro-
late dominance by varying the surface diﬀuseness and spin-
orbit strength of the mean-ﬁeld potential [59, 60] in order to
single out the parameter which is playing the essential role.
They have calculated the ground state deformations of all the
observed combinations of (N, Z) in nuclear chart to extract the
ratio of the numbers of prolate and oblate ground states, and
have examined its dependence on the strength of l2 potential
(surface diﬀuseness) and ls potential (spin-orbit strength) in the
Nilsson (WS) model. As the results, they found a strong in-
terference between the eﬀects of surface diﬀuseness and spin-
orbit strength on the prolate/oblate ratio. Particularly, the pro-
late dominance disappears when the spin-orbit parameter is re-
duced to the half of its realistic value. Considering this re-
sult, the analysis based on the model without taking account
of spin-orbit coupling is giving us only partial understandings
for the prolate-shape dominance of real nuclei. For a deeper
understanding of this feature, we make a semiclassical analysis
of the prolate-oblate asymmetry taking the spin-orbit coupling
into account.

plane. Solid (red) and dotted (blue) contour lines represent the nega-
tive and positive δE, respectively. Thick lines represent the constant-
action ones (80) for some important short POs.

Figure 25 shows the level diagram for the power parameter
α = 5.0 and spin-orbit parameter κ = 0.06, which are consid-
ered as realistic for medium-mass nuclei. The spherical magic
numbers (70) are correctly reproduced with those values of the
parameters. The behaviors of the level splittings with increas-
ing prolate and oblate sides look similar to the case without
spin-orbit coupling: one sees the same suppression of level fan-
nings on the oblate side as we see in the case without spin-orbit
coupling (see the upper panel of ﬁgure 22). Hence it seems that
the argument in [58] also applies to the case of ﬁnite spin-orbit
coupling.

However, behavior of the deformed shell energies show quite
strong dependence on the spin-orbit parameter. Figure 26
shows the contour maps of the shell energies δE(N; δ) as func-
tions of the deformation parameter δ and the particle number N,
for the power parameter α = 5.0. We compare the results for
the case of realistic value of the spin-orbit parameter κ = 0.06
and for the reduced value κ = 0.03 where Tajima et al found
disappearance of the prolate dominance. One may notice the
obvious diﬀerence in the valley structures in the deformed shell

energies in those two maps, especially on the oblate side. For
κ = 0.06 the valley lines on the oblate side are approximately
ﬂat, while for κ = 0.03, one ﬁnds valleys with considerably
large slopes.

Figure 27 compares the prolate and oblate deformation-
energy minima Edef(N; δmin) for diﬀerent values of κ with ﬁxed
value of the power parameter α = 5.0. The bottom panel for
κ = 0 is equivalent to the top panel of ﬁgure 24. With increas-
ing κ, the diﬀerences between prolate and oblate energy minima
are reduced at κ = 0.03, the half of the realistic value, man-
ifesting the disappearance of prolate-shape dominance. How-
ever, the diﬀerences grow again for the realistic value κ = 0.06
and the prolate minima become considerably lower than the
oblate ones, implying the revival of the prolate-shape domi-
nance. All these results nicely correspond to the behavior of
shell energy valleys found in ﬁgure 26. Therefore, it is essen-
tial to describe the above behavior of the shell energy valleys
with varying spin-orbit strength for understanding the origin of
prolate dominance observed in real nuclei.

To understand the above changes in deformed shell struc-
tures from semiclassical view point, we investigated the eﬀect
of spin-orbit coupling on the properties of the classical POs.
Figure 28 illustrates what kinds of changes are induced in the
shortest POs when the spin-orbit coupling is switched on. For
κ = 0, one has two diameter orbits X and Z, and the bridge
orbits C connecting them at δ = ±δc as one sees in ﬁgure 11.
With increasing spin-orbit strength κ, the periods of the orbits
C±, whose orbital angular momenta parallel and anti-parallel
to the spin, separate from each other into L and S (denoting
long and short, respectively). The changes in diameters X and
Z show peculiar dependence on the deformation. The left part
(δ < −δc) of X and the right part (δ > δc) of Z changes into
oval orbit with orbital angular momenta parallel to the spin and
are continuously connected with L at ±δc, while the right part

(δ > −δc) of X and the left part (δ < δc) of Z changes into those
having the opposite directions of orbital angular momenta and
cause tangent bifurcations with S at δ = ±δc. One should also
note that, with increasing spin-orbit parameter κ, the bifurcation
deformation δc becomes smaller and the orbit (2,1)S shrinks to
a small deformation domain (see appendix for some detailed
analyses on those bifurcations). On the other hand, the orbit
(2,1)L survives for any larger deformation. With increasing κ,
it undergoes bifurcation and new triangular-type orbits (3,1)X
and (3,1)Z (which are symmetric with respect to the x and z
axes, respectively) emerge from it at around κ = 0.05 ∼ 0.06,
depending on the deformation δ. Therefore, the orbits (2,1)L
and (3,1)’s have almost the same values of scaled periods at
κ = 0.06. Those orbits should make coherent contribution to
the level density, and are expected to give signiﬁcant eﬀects
on the deformed shell structures for wide range of deformation
δ due to the bifurcation enhancement eﬀect discussed in sec-
tion 2.2.

Thanks to the scaling relation for those frozen-spin orbits,
we can make use of the Fourier analysis in investigating how
their contributions change with varying κ. Figure 29 shows the
moduli of Fourier transforms |F(τ; δ)| of the quantum scaled-
energy level densities, calculated for κ = 0.03 and 0.06. Thick
lines show the scaled periods of some shortest POs which are
displayed in ﬁgure 30. One ﬁnds that the Fourier amplitudes
have peaks exactly along these meridian frozen-spin POs. The
cross sections along the vertical line at several deformations are
shown in ﬁgure 31 in order to see the relative strengths of the
Fourier amplitudes.

On the prolate side, one ﬁnds considerable Fourier peak at
the shortest orbit (2,1)X, and it is expected to make major con-
tribution to the shell energy. On the oblate side, the shortest or-
bit is (2,1)Z, but its contribution is smaller than that of (2,1)X.
This is because (2,1)Z occupies smaller phase-space volume
since it is isolated in the κ → 0 limit. Thus the second shortest
(2,1)X play major role also in the oblate side. However, the
orbit (2,1)X reaches only up to δ ∼ −0.2 for κ = 0.06, and
it cannot contribute much to the shell structures on the oblate
side. At this realistic value of κ, the orbit (2,1)L causes a bifur-
cation from which triangular-type orbits (3,1) emerge as dis-
cussed above. With this bifurcation enhancement eﬀect, their
contribution to the shell energy become dominant on the oblate
side. As one sees in the upper panel of ﬁgure 26, the constant-

action lines of (2,1)L+(3,1) nicely explain the ﬂat valleys in
shell energy on the oblate side. For κ = 0.03, the half of the
realistic value, the shell energy valleys are explained by the or-
bit (2,1)X on both prolate and oblate sides. Those valleys may
play roles in establishing good oblate and prolate minima, and
explain the reason for the disappearance of prolate dominance
at this value of κ.
In this way, the change in prolate-oblate
asymmetry with varying spin-orbit coupling can be clearly un-
derstood from the properties of the classical POs.

In summary, we consider the behavior of the shell energy val-
leys in the (δ, N) plane which provides us the key to understand
the origin of prolate-shape dominance in nuclear ground-state
deformations. These shell energy valleys have large slopes on
the prolate side while they are approximately ﬂat in the oblate
side, and one has less possibility to acquire shell energy gains
with oblate deformations. In practice, one sees nice correspon-

dence between the properties of the valley slopes and the de-
formed shell-energy gains. The features of the level fannings
should also have some eﬀects but seems to bear less important
roles in the gross shell eﬀects. The way in which POs con-
tribute to the shell energy is quite sensitive to the spin-orbit
parameter. Although the shell energy valleys for κ = 0 look
similar to the case of realistic value κ = 0.06, the semiclassi-
cal mechanisms for the enhancement of the PO contributions
are quite diﬀerent in both cases. Thus, above semiclassical in-
terpretation gives us a deeper understanding on the origin of
prolate dominance for realistic nuclear systems.

Applying the semiclassical POT to the radial power-law poten-
tial models, emergence of a rich variety of nuclear shell struc-

Nuclear shell structures in terms of classical periodic orbits

tures are investigated from the view point of quantum-classical
correspondence. In our semiclassical analyses, we make full
use of the scaling properties of the power-law potential model
and the Fourier transformation techniques, which are also ef-
fective under the existence of spin-orbit coupling. We have
emphasized the signiﬁcant roles of the PO bifurcations for the
remarkable enhancement of shell eﬀects with varying the pa-
rameters like surface diﬀuseness (controlled by the power pa-
rameter α), deformations and spin-orbit coupling strength. At
the bifurcation points, a family of quasi-periodic orbits appears
around the bifurcating PO, where an approximate dynamical
symmetry is locally restored. In the bridge-orbit bifurcation,
the above local family occupies a large volume of the phase-
space extending along the trail of the bridge which connects
two widely separated POs, and brings about a larger dynamical
symmetry compared to those for simple bifurcations. We have
found such peculiar bridge-orbit bifurcations play pivotal roles
in exotic nuclear deformations such as superdeformations and
tetrahedral deformations. It is also interesting to note that, the
SU(3) symmetry of the spherical HO Hamiltonian, once bro-
ken for sharp potential surface with power parameter α > 2,
is partially compensated by the spin-orbit coupling as we see
in section 4, and also by the octupole deformation of Y32 type
as we see in section 5.2. Semiclassical analyses based on the
realistic model for nuclear mean ﬁeld with spin-orbit coupling
taken into account provide us a deep understanding of the ori-
gin of the prolate-shape dominance, which may show up under
a delicate balance between the eﬀect from the surface diﬀuse-
ness and that from the spin-orbit coupling.

Analyses of other types of nuclear deformations using the
power-law potential model with and without spin-orbit cou-
pling are also intended. For instance, properties of shell struc-
ture under reﬂection-asymmetric shapes by considering com-
binations of diﬀerent types of the octupole deformations, also
with the quadrupole terms, should be interesting, which might
be responsible for the systematics of ground-state deforma-
tions with reﬂection asymmetry, and also for the fragment mass
asymmetries in nuclear ﬁssions.

In this paper, we have used the semiclassical trace for-
mula to extract information on contributing classical POs from
the quantum-mechanically calculated single-particle spectra by
means of the Fourier transformation technique and the meth-
ods of constant-action lines, but have not directly estimated
the semiclassical level densities and shell energies in the bi-
furcation region. It is a challenging subject to develop analytic
and numerical methods to evaluate semiclassical trace formula
valid under existence of continuous symmetries, bifurcations,
and coupling with spin degree of freedom. This becomes ac-
tually important when we apply the semiclassical theories to
more general Hamiltonians without scaling, which would be
required, for instance, in descriptions of weekly bound nu-
clei. Concerning the shell structures of such unstable nuclei,
quenching of the spherical shell gaps might be one of the inter-
esting subjects [61].

Nuclear shell structures in terms of classical periodic orbits

Appendix: Analyses of periodic orbit bifurcations with
monodromy matrices

Classical PO changes their shapes continuously with varying
potential parameter. The monodromy matrix (37) varies ac-
cordingly and one of the eigenvalues may coincides with unity
which causes a bifurcation the orbit. Due to the symplectic
property of the Hamiltonian dynamics, the monodromy matrix
M is real and symplectic:

MT JM = J,

J = 0 −I
0! .

I

(A1)

Hence, the eigenvalues of M always appear in a conjugate-
reciprocal pair either of

(i) e±iv with real v (elliptic)
(ii) e±u with real u (hyperbolic)
(iii) −e±u with real u (hyperbolic with reﬂection)
or in a quartet

(iv) e±u±iv with real u and v (loxodromic).

The bifurcation takes place at v = 0 in the case (i) or at u = 0
in the case (ii). The POs are stable if the monodromy matrix
has only elliptic eigenvalues, and otherwise unstable because
the deviations of the initial condition will grow exponentially
as time evolves.

For the 2D systems, or the 3D systems with axial symme-
try, generic PO has a (2 × 2) (symmetry reduced) monodromy
matrix and its eigenvalues appear in a pair either of (i)–(iii).
The stability of a PO is uniquely determined by the value of the
stability factor t = Tr M − 2 = − det(M − I) as
(i) t = 2 cos v − 2 = −4 sin2(v/2), −4 ≤ t ≤ 0
(ii) t = 2 cosh u − 2 = 4 sinh2(u/2) > 0
(iii) t = −2 cosh u − 2 = −4 cosh2(u/2) < −4
For 3D systems without continuous symmetry, generic PO has
(4× 4) monodromy matrix, and its four eigenvalues can be gen-
erally expressed as (λ1, λ−1
2 ). Then the stability of the
PO is determined by the two stability factors ti (i = 1, 2) deﬁned
by

1 , λ2, λ−1

ti ≡ λi + λ−1
With the relations

i − 2 = −(λi − 1)(λ−1

i − 1).

Tr(M − I) = t1 + t2,

det(M − I) = t1t2,

(A2)

(A3)

the above stability factors are simply obtained as the two roots
of the quadratic equation

t2 − t Tr(M − I) + det(M − I) = 0.

(A4)

If the monodromy matrix has two pairs of eigenvalues either in
(i)–(iii) above, both t1 and t2 take the real values as in 2D cases,
while they take complex values t1, t2 = t∗1 for the loxodromic
case (iv).

Figure 32. Stability factors ti (or Re ti for loxodromic stability) of
some shortest POs as functions of the octupole deformation parameter
β32. Dots indicate the bifurcation points.

As the ﬁrst example, we shall discuss some details on the
bifurcations found in the power-law potential with Y32 defor-
mation which we discussed in section 5.2. The planar trian-
gular orbit PC, and 3D triangular orbits TA and TC (see ﬁg-
ure 21) play the most important roles in deformed shell struc-
ture. Figure 32 displays the values of ti for some shortest POs
as functions of the deformation parameter β32. As one sees
in the bottom panel, one of the ti’s for the above three domi-
nant POs are very close to zero in 0 < β32 < 0.3, and those
POs undergo bifurcations almost simultaneously at β32 ∼ 0.3,
where deformed shell eﬀect is extremely enhanced. In the mid-
dle panel, expanded plots of those POs in the small β32 region
are shown. The planar orbit PC undergoes pitchfork bifurca-
tion at β32 = 0.035 and the 3D orbit TC emerges. TC and
TA undergo touch-and-go bifurcation at β32 = 0.105. In the
top panel, expanded plots around the bifurcation deformation
β32 ∼ 0.29 are shown. The orbit PC undergoes pitchfork bifur-
cation at β32 = 0.289 and 3D orbit TF emerges. A pair of 3D or-
bits TD and TE emerge via tangent bifurcation at β32 = 0.292,
and TE causes a pair annihilation with TC just after its emer-
gence. The orbits TD and TA undergo touch-and-go bifurcation
at β32 = 0.298. As described here, the above dominant POs are
connected with each other by the complicated network of quasi-
periodic families of orbits via bifurcations. This feature seems
peculiar to the tetrahedral-type deformations [55].

For the second example, let us discuss the bifurcations of the
orbits (2,1) in spheroidal power-law potential with spin-orbit
coupling which we discussed in section 6. We limit ourselves to
the frozen-spin orbits in the meridian plane, and only consider
the bifurcation within a given meridian plane, e.g.
the (x, z)

plane. Under this limitation, bifurcations of POs can be con-
sidered in terms of the reduced (2 × 2) monodromy matrix M.
Figure 33 shows the values of the stability factor t = Tr(M − I)
for four oval-shape orbits (2,1) as functions of spheroidal defor-
mation parameter δ. For the spherical shape δ = 0, the orbits
X and Z compose the same degenerate family. With increas-
ing oblate deformation δ < 0, orbit (2,1)X approaches (2,1)S
and they ﬁnally cause pair annihilation via tangent bifurcation
at the certain deformation δ = −δc. With increasing prolate de-
formation δ > 0, the orbit (2,1)Z approaches (2,1)S and they
cause pair annihilation via tangent bifurcation at δ = δc. The
value of δc becomes smaller as increasing spin-orbit parameter
κ. The value of t for the orbit (2,1)L at |δ| . 0.2 is very close
to zero for κ = 0.06 since the orbit is close to the bifurcation
point from which the orbits (3,1) emerge. This indicates that
the (3,1) bifurcation makes signiﬁcant eﬀect on the deformed
shell structure for the realistic spin-orbit strength κ = 0.06 in
rather wide range of the deformation parameter δ.
