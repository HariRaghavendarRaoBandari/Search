ABSTRACT

We present a detailed analysis of the composition and nucleosynthetic origins of the heavy elements
in the metal-poor ([Fe/H] = −1.62 ± 0.09) star HD 94028. Previous studies revealed that this star is
mildly enhanced in elements produced by the slow neutron-capture process (s process; e.g., [Pb/Fe] =
+0.79 ± 0.32) and rapid neutron-capture process (r process; e.g., [Eu/Fe] = +0.22 ± 0.12), including
unusually large molybdenum ([Mo/Fe] = +0.97 ± 0.16) and ruthenium ([Ru/Fe] = +0.69 ± 0.17)
enhancements. However, this star is not enhanced in carbon ([C/Fe] = −0.06 ± 0.19). We ana-
lyze an archival near-ultraviolet spectrum of HD 94028, collected using the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope, and other archival optical spectra collected from
ground-based telescopes. We report abundances or upper limits derived from 64 species of 56 el-
ements. We compare these observations with s-process yields from low-metallicity AGB evolution
and nucleosynthesis models. No combination of s- and r-process patterns can adequately reproduce
the observed abundances, including the super-solar [As/Ge] ratio (+0.99 ± 0.23) and the enhanced
[Mo/Fe] and [Ru/Fe] ratios. We can ﬁt these features when including an additional contribution from
the intermediate neutron-capture process (i process), which perhaps operated by the ingestion of H in
He-burning convective regions in massive stars, super-AGB stars, or low-mass AGB stars. Currently,
only the i process appears capable of consistently producing the super-solar [As/Ge] ratios and ratios
among neighboring heavy elements found in HD 94028. Other metal-poor stars also show enhanced
[As/Ge] ratios, hinting that operation of the i process may have been common in the early Galaxy.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding the origin of the elements remains one
of the major challenges of modern astrophysics. Ideally,
to study the origin of each element, it is desirable to
collect data on each element’s abundance beyond the
solar system. Nearly all previous abundance studies of
heavy elements in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectra of

late-type stars have focused on stars enriched by prod-
ucts of rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis
(Cowan et al. 1996, 2002, 2005; Sneden et al. 1998, 2003;
Roederer et al. 2009, 2010, 2012a,b, 2014b; Roederer &
Lawler 2012; Barbuy et al. 2011; Peterson 2011; Siqueira
Mello et al. 2013). One study (Placco et al. 2014) has
studied the NUV spectrum of a carbon-enhanced metal-
poor (CEMP) star with no enhancement of neutron-
capture elements, and another (Placco et al. 2015) stud-
ied two CEMP stars enhanced with slow neutron-capture
(s-process) material (CEMP-s stars). Both stars in the
latter study, HD 196944 and HD 201626, are C-enhanced
([C/Fe] = +1.1 and +1.5) and show substantial enhance-
ments in many elements produced by s-process nucle-
osynthesis (e.g., [Ba/Fe] = +1.2 and +1.7; [Ce/Fe] =
+1.1 and +1.9; [Pb/Fe] = +2.1 and +2.9).

The new advance enabled by access to the NUV spec-
tra of these two stars was the detection of Ge i, Nb ii,
Mo ii, Cd i, Lu ii, Pt i, and Au i. Most of these species
are impossible to detect in the spectral range accessible
to ground-based telescopes, and Ge, Cd, Lu, Pt, and Au
had not been detected previously in any CEMP-s star.
HD 196944 and HD 201626 are each in wide binary sys-
tems with orbital periods of 1325 and 407 d (Lucatello et
al. 2005; Placco et al. 2015). Placco et al. compared these
abundances with model predictions, revealing that each
star could be reasonably ﬁt by the predicted s-process
yields from models of low-mass (≈ 0.9 M(cid:12)) stars on
the asymptotic giant branch (AGB; Lugaro et al. 2012;
Placco et al. 2013). The elements detected in the NUV
had only a minor impact on the model selection, but

2

the abundances of these elements all lie reasonably close
(within ≈ 2σ) to the model predictions. One exception,
Cd in HD 196944, was about 1 dex lower than that pre-
dicted by the model. Overall, however, the good agree-
ment was encouraging, since the models had not previ-
ously been confronted with observations of metal-poor
stars for these elements.

High-quality NUV spectra of stars capable of study-
ing the chemical fossil record are limited. These data
can only be collected with the Goddard High Resolu-
tion Spectrograph (GHRS), Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph (STIS), or Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
(COS). STIS and COS are both currently in operation
on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST ), and the
GHRS was retired during Servicing Mission 2 in 1997.
The long exposure times required and stiﬀ competition
for observing time on HST present formidable challenges
to obtaining new observational data. Fortunately, how-
ever, many high-quality spectroscopic datasets exist in
the HST archives. Some were taken for other scientiﬁc
purposes, and few abundance studies have focused specif-
ically on the heaviest elements—those produced mainly
by n-capture reactions.

HD 94028 is one such star with high-quality NUV spec-
tra in the HST archives. The high proper motion and
U − B excess of HD 94028 have been known for decades
(e.g., Roman 1954). Carney et al. (1994) and Clementini
et al. (1999) found hints of radial velocity variations in
their data for HD 94028, but these were not conﬁrmed
by Stryker et al. (1985), Jasniewicz & Mayor (1988),
Latham et al. (2002), or Roederer et al. (2014a). Peter-
son (2011) was the ﬁrst to point out the unusually-high
Mo abundance of HD 94028, [Mo/Fe] = +1.0. This star
also appeared in the metal-poor sample of Roederer et al.
(2014a), who found a mild excess of elements commonly
produced by s-process nucleosynthesis. Several investi-
gators have extended the chemical analysis of this star
into the NUV, but all have focused narrowly on one or a
few elements: Be and B (Thorburn & Hobbs 1996; Pri-
mas et al. 1999); Mo and Ru (Peterson 2011); Ge, As,
and Se (Roederer 2012); and P (Jacobson et al. 2014;
Roederer et al. 2014c).

In the present study, we perform a more thorough anal-
ysis of all trace, heavy elements detected in the NUV
spectrum of HD 94028. We place these results and the
large set of optical abundances available from Roed-
erer et al. (2014a) on a single abundance scale. The
heavy elements in HD 94028 show evidence of enrich-
ment by the r process, s process, and possibly a third,
still poorly-studied nucleosynthesis process, the interme-
diate n-capture process (i process). We attempt to model
this abundance pattern and identify viable metal enrich-
ment scenarios for HD 94028.

2. DATA

2.1. Observations from the Archives

We use two NUV spectroscopic data sets of HD 94028
available in the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.
These observations were made using STIS (Kimble et al.
1998; Woodgate et al. 1998) on board the HST. One
spectrum (data sets O5CN01-03, GO-8197, PI. Duncan)
has very high spectral resolution (R ≡ λ/∆λ ∼ 110,000).
This spectrum covers ≈ 1885–2147 ˚A with signal-to-noise

(S/N) ratios ≈ 35/1 per pixel near 2140 ˚A. The other
spectrum (data sets O56D06-07, GO-7402, PI. Peterson)
has high spectral resolution (R ∼ 30,000). This spectrum
covers 2280–3117 ˚A with S/N ratios ranging from ≈ 20
near 2300 ˚A to ≈ 40 near 3100 ˚A. We use the reduc-
tion and coaddition provided by the StarCAT database
(Ayres 2010).

Roederer et al. (2014a) derived abundances from an
optical spectrum of HD 94028 taken using the Robert G.
Tull Coud´e Spectrograph on the Harlan J. Smith Tele-
scope at McDonald Observatory, Texas. We rederive
abundances from this spectrum (Section 3.3) using the
model atmosphere (Section 3.1) adopted in the present
study. This spectrum covers 3650–8000 ˚A at R ∼ 30,000
with S/N ratios ranging from ≈ 55 near 3950 ˚A to ≈ 170
near 6750 ˚A.

We also use an optical spectrum taken with the Ultra-
violet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES; Dekker
et al. 2000) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Kueyen
at Cerro Paranal, Chile. We obtained this spectrum from
the ESO Science Archive. This spectrum covers 3050–
3860 ˚A at R ∼ 37,000 with S/N ratios ranging from ≈ 40
near 3200 ˚A to ≈ 130 near 3800 ˚A.

2.2. Atomic Data

We compile our list of lines to examine from several
recent studies of the NUV spectra of metal-poor stars.
These lines and the list of references are given in Table 1.
Many of these lines represent resonance or low-lying lev-
els, and they are frequently the dominant decay channels
from excited upper levels. Thus, the uncertainty in the
transition probability is generally small and limited by
the measurement uncertainty of the lifetime of the upper
level. These uncertainties are also listed in Table 1.

In Section 4.1, we examine whether any abundance
trends with wavelength are apparent in Fe i or ii lines.
These lines are listed in Table 2. All lines used are
included in the Atomic Spectra Database (Kramida et
al. 2014) maintained by the National Institute of Stan-
dards and Technology (NIST). These lines have log gf
values rated with a “C” accuracy or better (< 25%, or
< 0.12 dex). Table 2 also reports our measurements of
the equivalent widths of these lines.

3. METHODS

3.1. Model Atmospheres

We adopt the model atmosphere parameters for
HD 94028 derived by Roederer (2012), with eﬀec-
tive temperature Teﬀ = 5720 ± 71 K, surface grav-
ity log g = 4.31 ± 0.16, microturbulence velocity
vt = 0.90 ± 0.30 km s−1, and metallicity [M/H] =
−1.62 ± 0.09. The uncertainties are estimated follow-
ing section 8.5 of Roederer et al. (2014a). The parallax
of HD 94028 is known to better than 5% (measured by
Hipparcos; van Leeuwen 2007), and the inferred log g
value indicates HD 94028 is an unevolved main sequence
star. Fe ionization equilibrium was not enforced when
deriving the model atmosphere parameters. We interpo-
late the model atmosphere from the ATLAS9 α-enhanced
grid of Castelli & Kurucz (2003).

We use a recent version of MOOG (Sneden 1973),
which includes the contribution of Rayleigh scattering
from atomic H in the source function (Sobeck et al. 2011),
to derive the abundances. For all lines in the NUV (ex-
cept Fe i and ii lines) we use MOOG to generate a series
of synthetic spectra where the abundance of the element
of interest is adjusted to match the observed spectrum.
Our line lists for the syntheses begin with the Kurucz &
Bell (1995) lists, and we update wavelengths and log gf
values with more recent experimental values whenever
possible. Numerous unidentiﬁed transitions are found
in the NUV spectra of late-type stars, like HD 94028.
Eﬀorts to identify these transitions are underway (Peter-
son & Kurucz 2015), and we include the results of these
eﬀorts in our line lists. We model the remaining uniden-
tiﬁed features using low-excitation Fe i lines.

We include the eﬀects of hyperﬁne splitting (HFS)
structure and isotope shifts (IS) in the syntheses when-
ever possible. We adopt isotopic mixtures that reﬂect a
predominantly s-process origin, using the isotopic distri-
butions presented in Sneden et al. (2008). For Cd ii, the
abundance derived using the s-process isotopic mix dif-
fers from that using the r-process mix by +0.14 dex.
For Pb i, the abundance derived using the s-process
isotopic mix diﬀers from that using the r-process mix
by +0.06 dex. For both Yb ii lines, the s-process and
r-process isotopic mixtures yield identical abundances.

3.3. Re-analysis of Optical and NUV Data

Roederer et al. (2014a) performed a detailed abun-
dance analysis of HD 94028 using the optical spectrum
taken at McDonald Observatory. The model atmosphere
parameters adopted by Roederer et al. are suﬃciently
diﬀerent (Teﬀ = 5730 K, log g = 3.70, vt = 1.00 km s−1,
[M/H] = −1.81) that we have rederived abundances from
all lines examined in that study using the model atmo-
sphere described in Section 3.1.
If Roederer et al. re-
ported an equivalent width for a line, we use MOOG
to compute a theoretical equivalent width that is forced
to match the measured equivalent width by adjusting the
input abundance. For all other lines, we use the spectrum
synthesis matching technique described in Section 3.2.
We also rederive the P abundance from the P i line at
2136 ˚A, and the result agrees with the value derived by
Roederer et al. (2014c). The results of this reanalysis are
reﬂected in the abundances presented in Table 3.

We use the UVES spectrum to derive abundances of
additional elements for the ﬁrst time in HD 94028. We
derive these abundances using the spectrum synthesis
method. These lines are listed in Table 1.

Roederer et al. (2014a) searched for lines that yielded
abundances consistently deviant from the mean abun-
dance of each species. That study deﬁned a set of em-
pirical corrections for these optical lines, listed in their
Table 16, and we apply the corrections for metal-poor
main sequence stars to our rederived optical abundances
when available. These corrections are reﬂected in the
values presented in Table 3.

Finally, we adopt corrections for deviations from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) for a few of the light
elements examined: Li (Lind et al. 2009), O (Fabbian et
al. 2009), Na (Lind et al. 2011), Al (Andrievsky et al.
2008), and K (Takeda et al. 2002). These corrections are
also reﬂected in the abundances presented in Table 3. We
apply no non-LTE corrections for heavy-element abun-
dances. Non-LTE corrections have been derived for in-
dividual lines of a few heavier elements in other stars,
but published grids—like those available for the light el-
ements noted here—do not yet exist to the best of our
knowledge.

4. RESULTS

4.1. Possible Trends with Wavelength

Oﬀsets of varying magnitude between the abundances
of lines derived from optical and NUV spectra have
been noted in recent years (Roederer et al. 2010, 2012b,
2014b,c; Lawler et al. 2013; Wood et al. 2013, 2014;
Placco et al. 2014, 2015; Sneden et al. 2016). These oﬀ-
sets are frequently found by comparing the abundance

yielded abundances deviant by more than 2σ from the
mean abundance were iteratively culled from the list.
Our ﬁnal list contains 53 Fe i lines and 40 Fe ii lines
with wavelengths between 2070 ˚A and 3100 ˚A. The list
of optical Fe i and ii lines (96 and 10 lines, respectively)
is taken from Roederer et al. (2014a) and rederived using
the model atmosphere described in Section 3.1.
Figure 1 illustrates our results. The mean abundance
derived from the NUV Fe i lines is [Fe/H] = −1.94 ± 0.03
(σ = 0.23), which is moderately lower than that de-
rived from optical Fe i lines, [Fe/H] = −1.81 ± 0.01
(σ = 0.11). The mean abundance derived from the NUV
Fe ii lines is [Fe/H] = −1.52 ± 0.06 (σ = 0.38), which is
in agreement with that derived from optical Fe ii lines,
[Fe/H] = −1.57 ± 0.03 (σ = 0.10). Note that the scat-
ter is considerably larger among the NUV lines, which
probably reﬂects unidentiﬁed blends and the challenge
of identifying the continuum in the NUV.

If missing continuous opacity is the cause of the small
Fe i abundance oﬀset, we would expect a similar oﬀset for
all abundances, including those derived from Fe ii lines.
No oﬀset is observed in the case of abundances derived
from Fe ii lines. If non-LTE or another eﬀect speciﬁc to
Fe i is the cause of the discrepancy, there is no need to
apply a global correction to the abundances derived from
lines of other species. Lacking compelling evidence, we
do not apply any corrections to the abundances derived
from lines in the NUV.

4.2. Heavy Elements in the NUV

Roederer (2012) derived abundances of Ge, As, Se, and
Pt in HD 94028. We expand this inventory to include Cu,
As (including one more line), Mo, Ru, Pd, Ag (upper
limit only), Cd, Te, Yb, Lu, W (upper limit only), Os,
Pt (one more line), Hg (upper limit only), and Pb (one
more line). These abundances are listed in Table 3. The
[X/Fe] ratios, where X represents a given element, are
computed using the Solar reference abundances given in
Asplund et al. (2009). All [X/Fe] ratios are constructed
using the abundances derived from species in the same
ionization state; i.e., neutrals to neutrals and ions to ions.
Abundances or ratios denoted with the ionization state

derived from many Fe i lines at a wide range of wave-
lengths. The causes of these oﬀsets are not understood
at present, but missing sources of continuous opacity and
departures from LTE may each be partly responsible.

Our initial list of Fe i and ii lines in the NUV was much
longer than the ﬁnal list presented in Table 2. Lines
with obvious blends have been discarded, and lines that

Table 3 also lists several sets of uncertainties. The sta-
tistical uncertainty, σstat, is computed from equation A17
of McWilliam et al. (1995), which includes uncertainties
in the equivalent widths or synthesis matching and log gf
values. The total uncertainty, σtot, is computed from
equation A16 of McWilliam et al., which includes the
statistical uncertainty and uncertainties in the model at-
mosphere parameters. The other two uncertainties listed
in Table 3 are computed from approximations of equa-
tions A19 and A20 of McWilliam et al., which give un-
certainties in the abundance ratios. To calculate the un-
certainty in the ratio of two elements A and B, σ[A/B], we
recommend that σI for element A be added in quadra-
ture with σstat for element B when element B is derived
from lines of neutral species. Similarly, we recommend
that σII for element A be added in quadrature with σstat
for element B when element B is derived from lines of
ionized species.

The Te i line at 2142.822 ˚A is extremely blended with
an Fe i line at 2142.832 ˚A, as shown in Figure 2. The
log gf value of the blending Fe i line is unconstrained by
experiment. We follow our earlier work on HD 160617
(Roederer & Lawler 2012) and attempt to ﬁt the over-
all line proﬁle using the abundance of Te and the log gf
value of the Fe i line as free parameters in the ﬁt. The
log gf value favored by our best ﬁt, −2.7,
is moder-
ately diﬀerent than the value favored by our best ﬁt in
HD 160617, −3.1. We attribute only a small fraction
of the absorption at this wavelength to Te i, and the
line has little sensitivity to the Te abundance, thus we
caution that the Te abundance derived from this line is
highly uncertain.

The abundance derived from the Lu ii line at 2615.41 ˚A
is higher than would be expected based on the abun-
dances of neighboring elements Yb and Hf (Section 5.2).
We have no reason to discount our Lu measurement,
shown in Figure 3, but we caution that it is derived from
a single line. Other observations of the Lu ii line at
2615 ˚A would be useful to diagnose any unidentiﬁed sys-
tematics.

Figure 3 illustrates the two lines of W ii that we have
examined. We do not detect absorption coincident with
the W ii line at 2088.02 ˚A, and we derive an upper limit
from this line. We do, however, detect absorption coin-
cident with the W ii line at 2118.88 ˚A. The upper limit
derived from the former line is inconsistent with the ab-
sorption detected at the latter. The red line shown in
the bottom panel of Figure 3 is the 3σ upper limit in-
ferred from the line in the third panel of Figure 3, not a
ﬁt to the line shown. We conclude that the absorption
detected at 2118.88 ˚A is not due to W ii, so we derive
only an upper limit on the W abundance.

The Hg ii line at 1942.27 ˚A presents an interesting
case. Absorption is clearly detected at this wavelength,
but as shown in Figure 4, our syntheses provide a poor
ﬁt to the spectral region surrounding this line. The S/N
here is low (∼ 10–15). Other hints of absorption at
1941.61 ˚A, 1941.84 ˚A, 1941.96 ˚A, 1942.43 ˚A, 1942.66 ˚A,
and 1942.90 ˚A correspond to 12C16O transitions. Fe ii

may also contribute to the absorption at 1942.99 ˚A.
These absorption features also appear in a spectrum of
HD 160617 of similar quality, so they are likely to be real
lines and not noise. Another 12C16O transition of compa-
rable strength is predicted at 1942.27 ˚A, which coincides
with the Hg ii line. Our syntheses fail to adequately re-
produce the strengths and the wavelengths of these CO
lines. The absorption at 1942.27 ˚A is slightly stronger
than the other predicted CO lines, so Hg ii might be
present here; however, we advise against attempts to de-
rive an abundance from this blended, noisy line. The
upper limit on Hg that we report in Table 1 is based on
the entire absorption feature at 1942.27 ˚A resulting from
an s-process isotopic mixture of Hg ii.

4.3. Multiple Species of Cu, Zn, Mo, and Cd

With access to the NUV spectrum of HD 94028, we
have now detected both the neutral and singly-ionized
states of Cu, Zn, Mo, and Cd. Both states give abun-
dances in agreement for Cu and Zn. [Mo ii/Fe] is higher
than [Mo i/Fe] by 0.42 ± 0.28 dex, and [Cd ii/Fe] is
lower than [Cd i/Fe] by 0.59 ± 0.33 dex. Roederer et al.
(2014b) derived [Cd/Fe] ratios from Cd i and ii lines in

two stars, and in both cases they agreed.

Peterson (2011) derived abundances in HD 94028 us-
ing the same STIS spectra we have used. All abun-
dance ratios in common with Peterson are in excellent
agreement. The surprising result of her study was an
enhanced [Mo/Fe] ratio in HD 94028, +1.0, which we
conﬁrm, +0.97 ± 0.16. Both results are derived from
Mo ii lines in the NUV. When one optical Mo i line
is used, the [Mo/Fe] ratio is lower by a little more than
1σ, [Mo/Fe] = +0.55 ± 0.22. Roederer & Lawler (2012)
and Roederer et al. (2014b) derived [Mo/Fe] ratios from
neutral and ionized lines in two stars, and in all cases the
[Mo/Fe] ratios derived from diﬀerent species agreed.

We suggest that the diﬀerences for [Cd/Fe] and
[Mo/Fe] reﬂect the diﬃcult nature of deriving abun-
dances from small numbers of lines in crowded spectral
regions. Ideally, these ratios should be examined in larger
samples of stars to identify potential systematic eﬀects.
In the subsequent discussion, we adopt the abundances
derived from neutral lines for Zn, ionized lines for Cu and
Mo, and the average of the two for Cd.

5. DISCUSSION

5.1. AGB Models

Fig. 4.— Comparison of observed and synthetic spectra for a
selection of Os ii, Pt i, Hg ii, and Pb i lines. The squares mark
the observed spectrum of HD 94028. For Os ii, Pt i, and Pb i,
the red line marks the best-ﬁt abundance, and the gray shaded
region represents a change in the best-ﬁt abundance by a factor
of ≈ two (± 0.3 dex). for Hg ii, the red line represents the upper
limit derived assuming Hg ii is responsible for all absorption at
1942.27 ˚A. The bold black line represents a synthesis with no Os,
Pt, Hg, or Pb present.

Substantial portions of some of the heaviest elements—
like Ba, Ce, and Pb—may be produced by the s process
in a star (or stars) that passed through the thermally-
pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) phase of evolution. The s pro-
cess occurs in the He-intershell, where freshly synthesized
elements are brought to the surface by recurrent mixing
episodes. Convection also dredges up lighter elements
such as C and F, which are produced together with the
s process (see reviews by Herwig 2005; Karakas & Lat-
tanzio 2014).

We use the low-metallicity AGB evolution and nucle-
osynthesis models from Karakas et al. (2014) and Shin-
gles et al. (2015). These models were calculated with an
initial metallicity of Z = 0.0006 ([Fe/H] = −1.4), which
is close to the derived metallicity of HD 94028. The mod-
els cover a range in mass from 1.7M(cid:12), with a lifetime of
1.4 Gyr, to 6M(cid:12), with a lifetime of 61 Myr. The low-
mass models (M (cid:46) 3M(cid:12)) require a 13C pocket for the
formation of s-process elements, and the predicted dis-
tribution at these low metallicities is peaked at Ba and
Pb (Busso et al. 2001; Travaglio et al. 2004).
In con-
trast, the He-intershells of the intermediate-mass models
(M > 3M(cid:12)) are hot enough to ignite the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg
reaction more eﬃciently. This typically produces ele-
ments at the ﬁrst s-process peak near Rb and Sr.

Many uncertainties aﬀect the AGB model predictions,
including mass loss and convection. The AGB phase is
terminated by mass loss, which also therefore determines
the maximum enrichment. AGB stars in low-metallicity
environments show similar mass-loss rates to AGB stars
in our Galaxy (Sloan et al. 2009; Lagadec et al. 2009).

We use the Vassiliadis & Wood (1993) mass-loss rate,
which has an implicit metallicity dependence in that the
equation for the pulsation period depends on the radius.
More thermal pulses are predicted for the lower metal-
licity models (e.g., Karakas 2014) compared with models
at solar metallicity. This may indicate that our mass-
loss rates may be too low for most of the AGB phase.
Reducing the AGB lifetime would decrease the number
of mixing episodes and would lower the yields of C and
s-process elements. The treatment of convection and
non-convective mixing processes is also uncertain. We
refer to Karakas & Lattanzio (2014) for a detailed dis-
cussion, but we note that including extra mixing in the
envelopes of precursor low-mass AGB stars may lower
the ﬁnal yield of C.

5.2. Comparison with AGB Nucleosynthesis Predictions
We illustrate the heavy element abundance pattern in
HD 94028 in Figure 5. Most heavy elements, X, are
only moderately overabundant, with 0 < [X/Fe] < 1.
We compare this pattern with six sets of low-metallicity
([Fe/H] = −1.4) AGB nucleosynthesis yields, with
Y = 0.24, taken from Karakas et al. (2014) and Shingles
et al. (2015). Several example ﬁts are shown. To cre-
ate the ﬁts shown in Figure 5, we mix the ﬁnal ejected
AGB yields with an r-process “foundation” of material
(e.g., Bisterzo et al. 2012; Lugaro et al. 2012). Nearly all
metal-poor stars contain some r-process material (e.g.,
Roederer 2013), and we assume that HD 94028 also in-
herited r-process material from its natal cloud. We refer
to this r-process material as the r-process foundation.

The pattern of the r-process abundance foundation is
inferred by a two step process. We begin by adopting
the solar r-process residual pattern. This pattern is sus-
pect for elements below the second r-process peak, so we
modify it for 32 ≤ Z ≤ 34 and 38 ≤ Z ≤ 48. The mod-
iﬁcations are made using abundances from the metal-
poor r-process-enhanced star HD 108317 (Roederer et
al. 2012b, 2014b). In other words, each modiﬁed element
X is normalized to Eu in the r-process residual pattern
using the X/Eu ratio in HD 108317.

We adjust the relative proportions of the r-process
foundation and the s-process material by eye to pro-
vide reasonable ﬁts to the observed abundance pattern.
These proportions are well constrained by the elements
beyond the second r-process peak, many of which are pre-
dominantly produced by only one of the two processes.
Elements whose production is dominated by the r pro-
cess (e.g., Eu, Dy, Pt) are reasonably ﬁt by scaling up
the r-process foundation by a factor of two relative to
HD 108317. Dilution factors for the s-process material
range from 1.2% for the 1.7 M(cid:12) model to 16% for the
6.0 M(cid:12) model. In other words, only a small percentage
of the s-process material ejected by the AGB models is
incorporated into HD 94028. We cannot reproduce the
overall shape of the abundance pattern using any com-
bination of r-process and s-process curves for the 4.0,
5.0, and 6.0 M(cid:12) AGB models. As shown for the 5.0 M(cid:12)
model, the ﬁrst s-process peak is over-produced by 0.2
to 0.8 dex, and the Pb abundance is under-produced by
1.0 dex. The lower-mass AGB models provide better ﬁts
for most elements.

A fourth panel in Figure 5 illustrates a scenario in
which HD 94028 is assumed to have acquired its s-process

Fig. 5.— Comparison of derived abundances (black symbols)
and four model ﬁts (lines). The ﬁnal ejected AGB s-process yields
have been diluted by 1.2%, 1.2%, 13%, and 1.8% for the 1.7 M(cid:12),

nent, scaled up by a factor of 2 relative to HD 108317, is included

material from its natal cloud. In this case, the s-process
contribution to the model curve shown reﬂects the yields
of AGB stars from 1.7 to 6.0 M(cid:12), weighted by their rel-
ative numbers in a Salpeter (1955) IMF and the ejected
Ba mass. The dilution of the integrated s-process yields
in this case is 1.8%. This also provides a reasonable ﬁt for
most abundances, which is not surprising since the low-
mass AGB stars dominate by number and total mass of
s-process material ejected per star.

5.3. Possible Nucleosynthesis Scenarios

Our Ge, As, Mo, Ru, Ag, and Lu predictions deviate
from the s- and r-process ﬁts by more than 1.5 times
the observational uncertainties. No model or combi-
nation of models can simultaneously reproduce the en-
hanced [Zr/Fe], [Mo/Fe], and [Ru/Fe] ratios and the so-
lar [Sr/Fe], [Y/Fe], [Pd/Fe], [Ag/Fe], and [Cd/Fe] ratios.
The super-solar [As/Ge] ratio, +0.99 ± 0.23 dex, is also
incompatible with s-process nucleosynthesis or any rea-
sonable combination of s-process and r-process material.
The use of the un-modiﬁed r-process residuals does not
improve the ﬁt for these elements, particularly in the
Sr–Ru mass region. In this section, we investigate and
exclude several nucleosynthesis processes as the sources
of these ratios.
The [As/Ge] = +0.99 and [Se/As] = −0.16 ratios ef-
fectively exclude several possible scenarios. These are
not compatible with the classical weak r process and dif-
ferent types of neutron-rich neutrino wind components
in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe; e.g., Fr¨ohlich et al.
2006; Farouqi et al. 2009; Roberts et al. 2010; Arcones
& Montes 2011). This signature is also not found in ear-
lier electron-capture SN simulations (e.g., Hoﬀman et al.
2008; Wanajo et al. 2009). More recent two-dimensional
hydrodynamic explosion models of electron-capture SNe
also produce [As/Ge] (cid:28) 1 (Wanajo et al. 2011a). Models
for nucleosynthesis in proton-rich neutrino wind compo-
nents predict a large scatter among the relative ratios
of Ge, As, and Se, and the integrated [(Ge+As+Se)/Fe]
ratio in CCSN ejecta is not often available (e.g., Kratz
et al. 2008; Roberts et al. 2010; Arcones & Montes 2011;
Wanajo et al. 2011b; Arcones et al. 2012). Previously,
most studies have focused on the Sr–Ag mass region (e.g.,
Hansen et al. 2012). Now that observational data are
available for metal-poor stars, we recommend checking
whether possible combinations of neutrino-driven wind
components could explain the observed ratios in the Ge–
Se mass region. Another scenario that could be explored
is the neutrino-induced r process in the He-shell of CC-
SNe, where neutrons are made by the interaction between
neutrinos and He nuclei (Banerjee et al. 2011).

The α-rich freezeout component is made in the deepest
ejecta of CCSNe (e.g., Woosley & Hoﬀman 1992). It is
thought to be the main source of 64Zn in the solar system
and Zn in the early Galaxy (e.g., Nomoto et al. 2013).
In Figure 6, we compare the abundances in HD 94028
with the products of a 15 M(cid:12) CCSN model by Pignatari
et al. (2013), which includes α-rich freezeout ejecta. The
progenitor structure was computed using the stellar code
GENEC (Eggenberger et al. 2008), and the CCSN explo-
sion simulations include the fallback prescription “rapid”
according to Fryer et al. (2012). The predictions are in-
consistent with the observations. The α-rich freezeout
component in these models mainly produces Zn, Ge, and

HD 94028 with several model predictions for the mass region from
Co to Ba. The observed abundance ratios are marked by black
squares. The small green circles show the predictions for yields
from the 15 M(cid:12) CCSN model (Pignatari et al. 2013), the purple
and teal diamonds show the predictions for yields from the fast-
rotating massive stars (Pignatari et al. 2008) multiplied (“p2”) and
divided (“d2”) by a factor of 2, and the large red circles show the
predictions for yields from the i process. Black squares mark the
observed abundance ratios. The solid line marks the solar ratios.

Zr, and the production of As is negligible. These yields
are aﬀected by many uncertainties, including the details
of the explosion, fallback, and progenitor mass. The abil-
ity to predict the relative production of elements in diﬀer-
ent mass regions (e.g., Zn and Zr) is limited. Predictions
for neighboring elements produced in similar conditions
should be more reliable, and the enhanced [As/Ge] ra-
tio found in HD 94028 is inconsistent with theoretical
predictions for the α-rich freezeout (Woosley & Hoﬀman
1992).
The AGB yields discussed in Section 5.2 all predict
−0.2 ≤ [As/Ge] ≤ 0.0. The low [As/Ge] predictions are
mainly due to the local n-capture cross sections in the
Ge–As mass region along the s-process path. As is not
made eﬃciently due to the relatively high 75As(n,γ)76As
cross section (e.g., Dillmann et al. 2008; Marganiec et
al. 2009). This conclusion is independent of the stellar
source of the s process or stellar uncertainties aﬀecting
the s-process production at low metallicity (e.g., Gallino
et al. 1998; Straniero et al. 2006; Bisterzo et al. 2012;
Lugaro et al. 2012; Karakas & Lattanzio 2014). In other
words, the nuclear physics limits the amount of As that
the s process can make.

The s process in fast-rotating massive stars has been
proposed as one of the possible scenarios to explain a
sample of old, metal-poor stars with enhanced Sr, Y, and
Zr (e.g., Pignatari et al. 2008; Frischknecht et al. 2012).
The boosted s process at low metallicity is due to the pri-
mary production of 14N and 22Ne, and 22Ne is the main
neutron source in these stellar models. In Figure 6, we
compare the abundances in HD 94028 with two models
of fast-rotating massive stars by Pignatari et al. (2008),
using the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg rate multiplied and divided by
a factor of 2 (see discussion in Pignatari et al. 2008 for
details). The abundance pattern is not compatible with
the observations in HD 94028. In particular, the mod-
els cannot reproduce the [Mo/Ru] ratio, and they do not

Rare Elements in HD 94028

eﬃciently produce elements in the Ge–As region. The
[As/Ge] ratio is sub-solar for both models, as expected
for an s-process source.

5.4. The i-process Contribution

A scenario that may be compatible with the observed
abundance pattern among the lighter n-capture elements
in HD 94028 is the i process (Cowan & Rose 1977). The
i process is a n-capture process triggered by the rapid
ingestion of a substantial quantity of H in He-burning
convective regions. H is captured by 12C to produce
13N. The 13N decays to 13C, and the 13C(α,n)16O re-
action is eﬃciently activated. The conditions leading
to i-process nucleosynthesis may be found in multiple
stellar sites, including super-AGB and post-AGB stars,
He-core and He-shell ﬂashes in low-metallicity low-mass
stars, and massive stars.

The H-ingestion episodes that activate the i process
are quite diﬀerent from those that form the 13C pockets
in AGB stars. 13C pockets form when a small amount
of H is mixed into the He-burning region on timescales
of ∼ 102 yr, comparable to the timescale for dredge-up
episodes, which lead to neutron densities ∼ 108 cm−3.
The key for the i process is that the neutron density is
governed by the interplay of two coincidentally similar
timescales (see Herwig et al. 2011 for more details). The
ﬁrst is the convective turn-over timescale of ∼ 10–20 min,
where the ingested H is advected into deeper and hotter
layers of the He-burning convection zone. 13N is released
when the timescale of the 12C(p,γ)13N reaction equals
this convective mixing timescale. The second is the β+
decay timescale of 13N, 9.6 min, which limits how fast 13C
can be produced. Generally speaking, the robustness of
the i-process neutron density is based on the universal
nature of these timescales, which ensure that a neutron
density ∼ 1015 cm−3 is produced whenever H is ingested
into He-burning driven convection.

In contrast, the neutron exposure does change from one
i-process site to another, since the i-process conditions
are inherently three-dimensional and hydrodynamic in
nature. The 12C(p,γ)13N reaction releases large amounts
of energy that aﬀect the convective ﬂow. Present mod-
els (Herwig et al. 2014) indicate that the star responds
with a global oscillation of shell H-ingestion.
Its non-
spherical nature implies that the stellar response to the
energy release from H-ingestions cannot be known from
spherically-symmetric simulations alone. Hydrodynamic
simulations indicate that the stellar response may be vi-
olent, and it is possible that the hydrodynamic feedback
will terminate the conditions suitable for the i process.
This termination would be diﬀerent for each site (e.g.,
low-mass AGB stars, post-AGB stars, or super-AGB
stars). The result would be nucleosynthetic signatures
that share a common intermediate neutron density but
diﬀer substantially in neutron exposure. For example,
we observe overabundances at and beyond Ba in some
CEMP-r/s stars, suggestive of an i process with a large
neutron exposure (Dardelet et al. 2015). We observe a
signiﬁcant enhancement of ﬁrst-peak elements in post-
AGB stars, suggestive of an i process with a lower neu-
tron exposure (Herwig et al. 2011).

These three-dimensional hydrodynamical models can
be used to inform one-dimensional stellar models (Her-
wig et al. 2011; Stancliﬀe et al. 2011; Herwig et al. 2014;

Woodward et al. 2015) and calculations involving the
i-process products (e.g., Cristallo et al. 2009; Herwig et
al. 2011; Bertolli et al. 2013). Bertolli et al. provided
an i-process trajectory to explore the main properties of
this process. This one-zone trajectory has, by design, the
same neutron density that we associate with convective
ingestion of H into a He-burning layer. We use this tra-
jectory and assume a stellar metallicity of [Fe/H] = −2
to calculate a set of i-process abundance ratios. Fig-
ure 6 shows the results of this calculation. We adjust the
conditions (neutron exposure and termination time) to
maximize production in the As–Mo region. These con-
ditions also produce super-solar [As/Ge] ratios, and pro-
duction drops beyond Te. The i-process ﬁt is not perfect.
For example, it over-produces Y compared to the obser-
vations. This is a simple trajectory, and more compre-
hensive models will be necessary to verify or refute this
scenario. Nevertheless, the i process provides a scenario
that can simultaneously explain the [As/Ge] and [Se/As]
ratios and the enhancement in Mo and Ru.

5.5. Light Elements

The elements with Z ≤ 30 in HD 94028 are all normal
when compared with other main sequence or subgiant
stars with similar metallicity. This material presumably
originated in prior generations of CCSNe.

The AGB models discussed in Section 5.2 also indi-
cate that signiﬁcant amounts of light elements (C to P,
6 ≤ Z ≤ 15) are produced. The light and heavy el-
ements produced by AGB stars should have the same
dilution factor when material is transferred to HD 94028
or its natal cloud. The dilution factors derived in the ﬁts
to the heavy elements are so small (< 2%) that any con-
tributions from the AGB stars to N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si,
and P are negligible (δ[X/Fe] ≤ 0.03 dex) when compared
with the material produced in CCSNe.
The [C/Fe] ratio, −0.06 ± 0.19, tells a diﬀerent story.
This ratio is in agreement with the mean [C/Fe] ratio
for main sequence and subgiant stars with [Fe/H] > −2,
[C/Fe] ≈ −0.12 (e.g., Gratton et al. 2000; Roederer et al.
2014a). Our low-mass and IMF-weighted models over-
predict the [C/Fe] ratio for HD 94028 by ∼ 0.4 dex after
dilution. In other words, a self-consistent enrichment sce-
nario for the C and s-process material in HD 94028 would
predict that HD 94028 is mildly C-enhanced, whereas no
C enhancement is observed.

This discrepancy is not resolved by shortcomings of our
model atmosphere. Comparisons of [C/Fe] ratios derived
from CH lines in one- and three-dimensional model at-
mosphere calculations of metal-poor dwarfs reveal large
discrepancies (Asplund 2004; Behara et al. 2010). They
indicate that one-dimensional models overestimate the
[C/Fe] ratio, however, so this is unlikely to be the source
of the discrepancy.

Our [C/Fe] ratio is in agreement with previous anal-
yses of CH molecular bands in HD 94028. Gratton et
al. (2000) derived [C/Fe] = −0.07 ± 0.09, Simmerer et
al. (2004) derived [C/Fe] = +0.05 ± 0.2, and Lai et al.
(2007) derived [C/Fe] = −0.05 ± 0.17. Tomkin et al.
(1992) examined both CH and C i features in HD 94028,
ﬁnding that [C/Fe] = −0.2 ± 0.15 from the molecu-
lar lines, +0.32 ± 0.09 from the atomic lines (assuming
LTE), and +0.28 ± 0.09 from the atomic lines (assuming
non-LTE). They found oﬀsets between the CH and C i

10

abundance indicators in other stars in their sample, but
the results from the atomic lines showed a dependence
on Teﬀ . Tomkin et al. suggested that the abundances
derived from the C i lines were too high and aﬀected by
a systematic error. We conclude that [C/Fe] is not en-
hanced above the solar ratio in HD 94028, so the tension
with our AGB model predictions stands.

The degree of the C discrepancy could be reduced if
extra mixing occurs in the envelopes of low-mass AGB
stars, as discussed in Section 5.1. Alternatively, the dis-
crepancy could be resolved if no AGB stars contributed
to HD 94028. This seems unlikely, however, since the
elements at the second and third s-process peaks are en-
hanced.

In this

5.6. The Enrichment of HD 94028
section, we explore scenarios where the
n-capture abundances in HD 94028 result from the com-
bined contributions of the s, r, and i processes. These
are illustrated in Figure 7. The agreement is superb for
most elements, and only Y, Pd, and Lu deviate by ∼ 2σ.
The i process contributes the largest share for most el-
ements with Z < 50 in HD 94028. An inferior ﬁt is
obtained if we omit any r-process contribution to the el-
ements lighter than Te. Using the un-modiﬁed r-process
residuals over-predicts the [Ge/Fe] and [As/Fe] ratios but
has no substantial impact on Se or the Sr–Ru region.
The i-process contribution is still required regardless of
whether we use the modiﬁed or un-modiﬁed r-process
pattern. The heaviest elements (Z ≥ 56) owe their ori-
gin only to the r process and s process. The r process
dominates the production of elements near the rare-earth
and third peaks, while the s process dominates the pro-
duction of the light rare-earth elements and Pb.

Is HD 94028 a single star, or does it have an unseen
white dwarf companion? HD 94028 shows no compelling
evidence of radial velocity variations; measurements by
Latham et al. (2002) span more than 5100 d and have
an rms of only 0.64 km s−1. If, however, there is a com-
panion and the system is observed face-on, it would also
show no radial velocity variations.

Is the presence of s-process material evidence that
HD 94028 must be in a binary system with a white
dwarf companion? Casagrande et al. (2011) derived an
age of HD 94028 of 12.35 Gyr (7.5 to 13.8 Gyr at 95%
conﬁdence intervals) from comparison with Padova and
BASTI isochrones. The longest-lived AGB star consid-
ered in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 has a lifetime of 1.4 Gyr.
Such stars could have formed, evolved through the TP-
AGB phase, and polluted the ISM before HD 94028 was
born.
In other words, the presence of s-process mate-
rial does not require a more-evolved companion star for
HD 94028.

We are unable to exclude either the single-star or bi-
nary system scenarios. We expect that HD 94028 ac-
quired its r-process material from its natal cloud. The
s-process and i-process material may have also been
present in the natal cloud or added later by a companion.

5.7. The i-process in Other Stars in the Early Galaxy
Evidence for the i process has been observed in the
post-AGB star known as Sakurai’s object (V4334 Sgr;
Herwig et al. 2011) and in presolar grains found in pris-
tine meteorites (Fujiya et al. 2013; Jadhav et al. 2013;

Fig. 7.— Comparison of the observed abundance pattern in
HD 94028 and contributions from the s-process (blue), r-process
(red), and i-process (gold) models. The s-process component is
taken from the 1.7 M(cid:12) TP-AGB model discussed in Section 5.2.
The r-process component is based on the solar r-process residuals
and modiﬁed as described in Section 5.2. The i-process component
is based on the trajectory from Bertolli et al. (2013) and tuned to
maximize production in the As–Mo region as described in Sec-
tion 5.4. The solid black line marks the sum of the three processes
for each element. The overall normalization for each process has
been adjusted by-eye. The distribution is expressed as log  and
[X/Fe] in the top and middle panels, and the bottom panel illus-
trates the residuals between the observed abundance pattern and
the sum of the models.

Liu et al. 2014). There are hints that the i process may
also be responsible for some of the abundance patterns
observed in young open clusters (Mishenina et al. 2015),
the CEMP-r/s stars (Dardelet et al. 2015; Jones et al.
2016), and low-mass post-AGB stars in the Magellanic
Clouds (Lugaro et al. 2015).

Our observations may be generalized to suggest that
super-solar [As/Ge] and solar or sub-solar [Se/As] ratios
could signal the operation of the i process in the early

Galaxy. These are a common feature in the nine metal-
poor stars analyzed by Roederer (2012) and Roederer
et al. (2012b, 2014b). The [As/Ge] ratios range from
+0.65 to +1.00 in ﬁve stars with −2.5 < [Fe/H] < −0.5.
[As/Ge] is constrained to be > +0.75 in two other stars,
and only upper limits (< +1.34) are available for two
more. The [Se/As] ratios in these stars range from −0.53
to +0.54 with a mean of −0.10. The observational un-
certainties on these ratios are typically 0.3–0.4 dex for
[As/Ge] and 0.3–0.7 dex for [Se/As], which reﬂects the
challenge of measuring absorption lines in the crowded
regions of the NUV spectrum.

No non-LTE calculations exist for Ge i, As i, or Se i
lines in late-type stars. Ge has a lower ﬁrst ionization
potential (7.90 eV) than As (9.79 eV) or Se (9.75 eV). If
overionization occurs, it is more likely to preferentially
aﬀect Ge i lines. This would reduce the [As/Ge] ratios.
Non-LTE corrections for other species with low ﬁrst ion-
ization potentials are typically 0.1–0.2 dex and rarely
exceed 0.5 dex (e.g., Takeda et al. 2005; Bergemann et
al. 2012; Yan et al. 2015) in late-type stars, however.
We conclude that it is unlikely that non-LTE eﬀects can
produce solar or sub-solar [As/Ge] ratios in these stars.
Peterson (2011) pointed out that the enhanced [Mo/Fe]
ratios found in HD 94028 and HD 160617 were un-
common. Subsequent data support this assertion. Mo
was detected in 30 of the 311 metal-poor stars exam-
ined by Roederer et al. (2014b). Two of those 30 stars
are highly enriched in r-process material (CS 22892–052
and CS 31082–001), and they are not representative of
the majority of metal-poor stars. Among the remaining
28 stars, none show [Mo/Fe] > +0.6. Similarly, in the
sample of stars with [Fe/H] < −1 examined by Hansen
et al. (2014), only 4 of the 34 stars with detected Mo
show [Mo/Fe] > +0.6. In contrast, super-solar [As/Ge]
and solar or sub-solar [Se/As] ratios appear common, at
least among the limited metal-poor stars where Ge, As,
and Se have been studied. This contrast may illustrate
the diverse paths leading to i-process nucleosynthesis.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have performed a detailed abundance analysis of el-
ements detectable in the NUV and optical spectra (1885–
8000 ˚A) of the metal-poor main sequence star HD 94028.
We have derived abundances of many trace elements that
are rarely studied in late-type stars. Our analysis re-
veals that several of these elements, including Ge, As, Se,
and Mo, hold important—and previously unrecognized—
clues necessary to identify the n-capture processes re-
sponsible for creating the heavy elements observed in
HD 94028 and other metal-poor stars.

We ﬁnd that no combination of r-process and s-process
material can fully account for the abundances of elements
from Ge to Pb in HD 94028. Some r-process material is
clearly present, as revealed by the rare earth elements
and third r-process peak. The s-process pattern ob-
served among other elements from Ba to Pb favors rela-
tively low-mass AGB stars (≈ 1.7 M(cid:12) or so), although
it is diﬃcult to reconcile this with the solar [C/Fe] ra-
tio observed in HD 94028. Including the contributions
from another n-capture process, the i process, improves

the ﬁt for elements from Ge to Te. This is necessary
to ﬁt the super-solar [As/Ge], solar or sub-solar [Se/As],
and enhanced [Mo/Fe] and [Ru/Fe] ratios. We exclude
scenarios involving the classical weak r process, α-rich
freezeout in CCSNe, and the s process in fast-rotating
massive stars. Other explosive-nucleosynthesis compo-
nents in CCSNe and in electron-capture SNe need to be
tested in detail for this mass region to verify which sce-
narios are compatible and which can be ruled out.

Our analysis establishes a new constraint for stellar nu-
cleosynthesis. These are the crucial questions: what are
the nucleosynthesis conditions that lead to super-solar
[As/Ge] and solar or sub-solar [Se/As] ratios, and can
some scenarios be excluded? The Ge-As-Se mass region
has never been a focus of detailed analysis of the diﬀer-
ent neutrino-wind nucleosynthesis components because
of a lack of observations. The impact of internal stel-
lar dynamics and nuclear uncertainties also need to be
considered. Here, our preliminary results indicate that
the i process may be a good candidate to explain these
abundance patterns.
