ABSTRACT

Due to the combination of a substantial spin-orbit coupling and correlation effects, iridium oxides hold a prominent place in
the search for novel quantum states of matter, including, e.g., Kitaev spin liquids and topological Weyl states. We establish
the promise of the very recently synthesized hyper-honeycomb iridate b -Li2IrO3 in this regard. A detailed theoretical analysis
reveals the presence of large ferromagnetic ﬁrst-neighbor Kitaev interactions, while a second-neighbor antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg exchange drives the ground state from ferro to zigzag order via a three-dimensional Kitaev spin liquid and an
incommensurate phase. Experiment puts the system in the latter regime but the Kitaev spin liquid is very close and reachable
by a slight modiﬁcation of the ratio between the second- and ﬁrst-neighbor couplings, for instance via strain.

Introduction
In magnetism, frustration refers to the existence of competing exchange interactions that cannot be simultaneously satisﬁed.
Such effects can spawn new states of matter with quite exotic physical properties. Most famous in this regard are the different
kinds of quantum spin liquids (QSL’s) that emerge from frustrated spin couplings.1 In these collective states of matter quantum
ﬂuctuations are so strong that they disorder the spins even at the lowest temperatures. The types of QSL states that then
emerge range from chiral ones2, 3 to Z2 topological spin liquids4–6 carrying fractionalized excitations. Both experimentally
and theoretically such QSL’s have been observed and intensely studied in two-dimensional (2D) systems.1–9 How this situation
carries over to three spatial dimensions (3D), in which tendencies towards formation of long-range ordered magnetic states
are in principle stronger and the disordering effect of quantum ﬂuctuations therefore less potent, is largely unexplored. This
is not only due to the limitations of theoretical and numerical approaches in 3D but also to the the sparsity of relevant
candidate materials.10 Very recently the latter however fundamentally changed through the synthesis of insulating Li2IrO3
polymorphs11–13 in which the magnetic moments of Ir4+ ions form 3D honeycomb structures with threefold coordination.
Here we concentrate on the b -Li2IrO3 polymorph, which forms a so-called hyper-honeycomb lattice, see Fig. 1. Such a lattice
might in principle support a 3D Kitaev spin liquid,14–17 a direct counterpart of its lower-dimensional, 2D equivalent.18–20

The 2D Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice is characterised by the presence of large uniaxial symmetric
magnetic couplings that cyclically permute on the bonds of a given hexagonal ring.18–20 A QSL phase is present in this
model if the ratio between the Kitaev interaction K and Heisenberg coupling J is larger than 8.20 Quasi-2D honeycomb com-
pounds initially put forward for the experimental realization of the Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian are 5d5 and 4d5 j≈ 1/2
systems19, 21 such as Na2IrO3, a -Li2IrO3 and Li2RhO3. Subsequent measurements evidenced, however, either antiferromag-
netically ordered22–25 or spin-glass26 ground states in these materials.

The three factors that complicate a straightforward materialisation of the Kitaev QSL ground state in the quasi-2D
honeycomb compounds are the presence of (i) appreciable additional exchange anisotropies,27–29 (ii) two crystallographi-
cally inequivalent Ir-Ir bonds and (iii) longer-range magnetic interactions between second- and third-neighbor iridium mo-
ments.22, 23, 27, 30, 31 These additional interactions push quasi-2D Na2IrO3 and a -Li2IrO3 towards the formation of long-range
antiferromagnetic (AF) order at temperatures below 15 K. Also the 3D honeycomb system b -Li2IrO3 orders magnetically: at
38 K the spins form an incommensurate (IC) ordering pattern32 with strong ferromagnetic (FM) correlations.11 Apparently
additional interactions beyond only the nearest-neighbor (NN) Kitaev and Heisenberg ones are relevant also in the 3D system.
This leaves two main challenges: ﬁrst, one would like to precisely quantify the different magnetic exchange interactions be-
tween the Ir moments and second, one should like to determine how far away the magnetic ground state is from a Kitaev-type

1

3D QSL. Here we meet these challenges through a combination of ab initio quantum chemistry calculations by which we de-
termine the NN magnetic couplings in b -Li2IrO3 and exact diagonalization (ED) of the resulting effective spin Hamiltonian,
on large clusters, to determine how far b -Li2IrO3 is situated from the QSL ground state in the magnetic phase diagram.
The ab initio results show that the NN exchange in b -Li2IrO3 is mostly FM, with relatively weak FM Heisenberg couplings
of a few meV, large FM Kitaev interactions in the range of 10–15 meV, and additional anisotropies not included in the plain
Kitaev-Heisenberg model. The sign and magnitude of second-neighbor Heisenberg couplings we determine from ﬁts of the
ED calculations to the experimental magnetization data. This second-neighbor effective coupling comes out as J2 ≈ 0.2−0.3
meV and is thus small and AF. Remarkably, this AF J2 stabilizes an IC magnetic structure that puts the system to be only a jot
apart from the transition to a QSL ground state. Our ﬁndings provide strong theoretical motivation for further investigations
on the material preparation side. The Kitaev QSL phase might be achieved by for instance epitaxial strain and relaxation in
b -Li2IrO3 thin ﬁlms, slightly modifying the J2/K ratio.

1 Results
1.1 Quantum Chemistry Calculations
Quantum chemistry calculations were ﬁrst performed for the on-site d-d excitations, on embedded clusters consisting of one
central octahedron and the three adjacent octahedra (for technical details, see Supplementary Information (SI) and Ref. 33).
Reference complete-active-space (CAS) multiconﬁgurational wave functions34 were in this case generated with an active
orbital space deﬁned by the ﬁve 5d functions at the central Ir site. While all possible occupations are allowed within the set
of Ir 5d orbitals, double occupancy is imposed in the CAS calculations on the O 2p levels and other lower-energy orbitals.
The self-consistent optimization was here carried out for an average of four states, i.e., 2T2g (t5
2g) and the states of maximum
spin multiplicity associated with each of the t4
g conﬁgurations. We then subsequently performed multireference
conﬁguration-interaction (MRCI) calculations34 with single and double excitations out of the Ir 5d and O 2p shells at the
central octahedron. MRCI relative energies, without and with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), are listed in Table I.

g), 4T2g (t4

g) and 6A1g (t3

Due to slight distortion of the O cage11 and possibly anisotropic ﬁelds associated with the extended surroundings, the
degeneracy of the Ir t2g levels is lifted. Without SOC, the Ir t5
2g states are spread over an energy window of ≈0.1 eV (see
Table 1). Similar results were earlier reported for the quasi-2D honeycomb iridates.33 The low-symmetry ﬁelds additionaly
remove the degeneracy of the j = 3/2 spin-orbit quartet. With orbitals optimized for an average of 5d5 states, i.e., 2T2g (t5
2g),
4T1g (t4
g), the j = 3/2-like components lie at 0.82 and 0.86 eV above the j ≈ 1/2 doublet,
by MRCI+SOC computations (see Table 1). If the reference active space in the prior CAS self-consistent-ﬁeld (CASSCF)
calculation34 is restricted to only three (t2g) orbitals and ﬁve electrons, the relative energies of the j ≈ 3/2 components in
the subsequent MRCI+SOC treatment are somewhat lower, 0.69 and 0.73 eV. The Ir t2g to eg transitions require excitation
energies of at least 3 eV according to the MRCI data in Table 1, similar to values computed for a -Li2IrO3.33
While the quantum chemistry results for the on-site excitations in b -Li2IrO3 resemble very much the data for the quasi-2D
honeycomb iridates, the computed intersite effective interactions show signiﬁcant differences. The latter were estimated by
MRCI+SOC calculations for embedded fragments having two edge-sharing IrO6 octahedra in the active region. As detailed
in earlier work,27, 35, 36 the ab initio quantum chemistry data for the lowest four spin-orbit states describing the magnetic spec-
trum of two NN octahedra is mapped in our scheme onto an effective spin Hamiltonian including both isotropic Heisenberg
exchange and symmetric anisotropies. Yet the spin-orbit calculations, CASSCF or MRCI, incorporate all nine triplet and nine
singlet states that arise from the two-Ir-site t5
2g conﬁguration (see SI). The MRCI treatment includes the Ir 5d electrons
and the O 2p electrons at the two bridging ligand sites.

MRCI+SOC results for the NN effective couplings are listed in Table II. The two, structurally different sets of Ir-Ir links
are labeled B1 and B2, see Fig. 1. For each of those, the O ions are distributed around the Ir sites such that the Ir-O-Ir bond
angles deviate signiﬁcantly from 90◦. While the B1 links display effective D2 point-group symmetry 1, the B2 bonds possess
Ci symmetry, slightly away from C2h due to small differences between the Ir-O bond lengths on the Ir2O2 plaquette of two
Ir ions and two bridging ligands (2.025 vs 2.023 ˚A11). The absence of an inversion center allows a nonzero antisymmetric
exchange on the B1 links. However, our analysis shows this antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling is the smallest
effective parameter in the problem — two orders of magnitude smaller than the dominant NN interactions, i.e., the Kitaev
exchange. On this basis and further symmetry considerations (see the discussion in Refs. [27, 35–37]), the effective spin
Hamiltonian for the B1 links is assumed D2h-like and in the local Kitaev reference frame (with the z axis perpendicular to the
Ir2O2 plaquette and x, y within the plane of the plaquette19, 27) it reads

We ﬁnd for the B2 links that slight distortions lowering the bond symmetry from C2h to Ci have minor effects on the computed
wave functions and the quantum chemistry data can be safely mapped onto a C2h model. For C2h symmetry, the elements of
the symmetric anisotropic tensor are such that G

The wave functions for the low-lying four states in the two-Ir-site problem can be conveniently expressed in terms of
1/2 pseudospins as in Table II. In D2 symmetry (B1 links) these pseudospin wave functions, singlet F S and triplet F

As seen in Table II, for each set of Ir-Ir links in b -Li2IrO3, B1 and B2, both J and K are FM. In contrast, J is AF for all pairs
27 and features different signs for the two types of Ir-Ir links in a -Li2IrO3.35 The Kitaev
of Ir NN’s in honeycomb Na2IrO3
exchange, on the other hand, is found to be large and FM in all 213 compounds, see Table II and Refs. 27, 35. In addition to
the Kitaev coupling, sizable off-diagonal symmetric anisotropic interactions are predicted. In b -Li2IrO3, these are FM for the
B1 bonds and show up with both + and − signs for the B2 links 2, see Table II.
1.2 Magnetic Phase Diagram
Having established the nature and the magnitude of the NN effective spin couplings, we now turn to the magnetic phase
diagram of b -Li2IrO3. In addition to the NN MRCI+SOC data of Table II, we have to take into account explicitly the second-
neighbor Heisenberg interactions. Due to the 3D nature of the iridium lattice, with alternate rotation of two adjacent B2 bonds
around the B1 link with which both share an Ir ion, one can safely assume that the third-neighbor exchange is vanishingly
small. Results of ED calculations for an extended (pseudo)spin Hamiltonian including the MRCI NN interactions and a
variable second-neighbor Heisenberg coupling parameter J2 are shown in Fig. 2. Different types of clusters were considered,
with either 16, 20 or 24 Ir sites. The 24-site cluster used in ED calculations with periodic boundary conditions is displayed in
Fig. 2(a) while the structure of the smaller clusters is detailed in SI.
i jh˜Si·
˜S jiexp[iq(ri−r j)] along two paths denoted as q
(ab-diagonal) in Fig. 2(a), where the distance between
neighboring B1 bonds is taken as 1. The results for several J2 values with the 24-site cluster are plotted in Fig. 2(b). The
propagation vector for each path (qmq /qmf ), determined as the wave number q providing a maximum of S(q), is plotted in
Fig. 2(c). For J2 = 0 the ground state is characterized by long-range FM order, i.e., qmq = qmf = 0, consistent with a previous
classical Monte Carlo study.38, 39 Given the strong FM character of the NN exchange, ground states different from FM order
are only obtained for ﬁnite AF J2. With increasing strength of the AF J2, qq develops ﬁnite values starting at J2 = J2,c1
and reaches p at J2 = J2,c2 whereas qf
is ﬁnite but small in the range J2,c1 < J2 < J2,c2 and zero otherwise. This evidences
two magnetic phase transitions, from FM to IC order and further to a commensurate ground state. The latter commensurate
structure corresponds to zigzag AF order, a schematic picture of which is shown in Fig. 2(d). The ED results for the four
different types of periodic clusters are here in good overall agreement, as shown in Fig. 2(e). Some differences arise only with
respect to the precise position of the critical points.

In order to investigate the magnetic properties of b -Li2IrO3, we calculated the static spin-structure factor S(q) = (cid:229)

(bc-diagonal) and f

An intriguing feature is the appearance of a SL state in between the FM and IC phases. Since the total spin 2S/N falls off
rapidly and continuously near J2 = J2,c1 [see Fig. 2(c)], the FM ground state is expected to change into SL before reaching the
IC regime. It can be conﬁrmed by a structureless static spin-structure factor, like nearly ﬂat q-dependence of S(q) at J2 = 0.65
in Fig. 2(b). In Fig. 2(e) we also provide the critical values marking the transition between the FM and SL states. This was
estimated as the point where any of the h˜Si· ˜S ji expectation values turn negative, which implies a collapse of long-range FM
order. Importantly, we ﬁnd that the SL phase shows up in each of the four different types of periodic clusters. A more detailed
analysis of the spin-spin correlations is provided in SI.

2 Discussion
Typically, a commensurate-to-IC transition critical point tends to be overestimated by using periodicity. For estimating more
precisely the critical J2 values we therefore additionally studied clusters with open boundary conditions along the c direction.

2The sign of these terms is with respect to the local Kitaev reference frame.

Also, for a direct comparison between our ED results and the experimentally observed magnetic structure, we introduce an
additional path d
(ac-diagonal), sketched in Fig. 3(a). The size of the cluster along a and b has insigniﬁcant effect on the
computed critical J2 values because qmf (ab-diagonal) is either zero, around the critical points (periodic 24-site cluster), or very
small, in the IC phase (periodic 16- and 20-site clusters), as seen in Fig. 2(c).

The value of the propagation vector along the d -path (qm

d ) is shown in Fig. 3(b) as function of J2 for various cluster
“lengths” in the c direction. The inset displays a ﬁnite-size scaling analysis for the critical values. In the inﬁnite-length limit,
we ﬁnd J2,c1 = 0.02 and J2,c2 = 1.43 meV. The corresponding phase diagram is provided in Fig. 3(c). Similar critical points,
i.e., J2,c1 = 0.02 and J2,c2 = 1.48 meV, are obtained for qmq

(see SI).

As shown in Fig. 3(b), the dropdown of 2S/N near J2 = J2,c1 is more clearly seen than in the case of periodic clusters
because the formation of IC order is not hindereded for open clusters. Deﬁning the FM-SL J2,c1 critical value as the point
where h˜Si· ˜S ji turns negative for any (i, j) pair, the SL phase in the vicinity of J2 ≈ J2,c1 = 0.02 meV would have a width of
about 0.01J2. In other words, a very tiny FM J2 coupling may drive the system from FM order to a SL state. With further
increasing J2, the system goes through an IC phase to AF zigzag order at J2 = 1.43 meV.
To ﬁnally determine the value of J2 in b -Li2IrO3, we ﬁtted the magnetization curve obtained by ED calculations at T =0 K
[see Fig. 3(d)] to the experimental data at T = 5 K.11 Such an exercise yields J2 = 0.2−0.3 meV, i.e., J2 ≈ 0.1J2,c2, so that
the system is relatively far from the instability to zigzag order but very close to the transition to the SL ground state. Since
with increasing J2 the propagation vector qm
d = 0) to that of the
d = p ), long-wavelength IC order with a small propagation vector is expected for b -Li2IrO3. By performing a
zigzag state (qm
d /p = 0.28± 0.04 for J2 = 0.3 meV in the inﬁnite-
ﬁnite-size scaling analysis of qm
d can be extracted from recent magnetic resonant x-ray diffraction data32
length limit. An experiment-based estimate for qm
[see Fig. 3(f)]; the spins on sites A and B (their distance is three lattice spacings) have almost opposite directions, which leads
d /p ∼ 1/3. That ﬁts reasonably well our theoretical estimate. The stabilization of an IC state by J2 couplings has been
to qm
previously discussed for 1D zigzag chains like the path we label here as d
The value extracted for J2 from our ﬁt of the magnetization data is thus within our theoretical framework fully consistent
with the experimentally observed IC magnetic order in b -Li2IrO3. Nevertheless we ﬁnd that the system is remarkably close
to a three-dimensional spin-liquid ground state, which can be reached by a minute change of ∼ 0.25 meV, an energy scale that
corresponds to about 3K, in the second-neighbour exchange parameter J2. Changes of this order of magnitude can easily be
induced by pressure or strain.

d of the IC phase increases smoothly from that of the SL (qm

d at J2 = J2,c1(N) + 0.28 meV, we obtain qm

in Ref. 40.

Table 1. Ir4+ 5d5 multiplet structure in b -Li2IrO3, all numbers in eV. Due to the noncubic environment, the T2g/T1g (and
spin-orbit coupled j = 3/2) states are split appart. We still use however notations corresponding to Oh symmetry. Only the
lowest and highest Kramer’s doublets are shown for each set of higher-lying spin-orbit states.
