ABSTRACT
We report on a search for optical pulsations from PSR J0337+1715 at its observed
radio pulse period. PSR J0337+1715 is a millisecond pulsar (2.7 ms spin period) in a
triple hierarchical system with two white dwarfs, and has a known optical counterpart
with g-band magnitude 18. The observations were done with the Array Camera for
Optical to Near-IR Spectrophotometry at the 200” Hale telescope at Palomar Obser-
vatory. No signiﬁcant pulsations were found in the range 4000-11000 ˚A, and we can
limit pulsed emission in g-band to be fainter than 25 mag.

Key words: pulsars: general – pulsars: individual (PSR J0337+1715) – stars: neutron

1 INTRODUCTION

Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are distinguished from classi-
cal rotation-powered pulsars (RPP) in their characteris-
tic parameters. MSPs have shorter periods, smaller pe-
riod derivatives, and weaker magnetic ﬁelds. They are
thought to be classical pulsars that have been spun up
by accretion from a binary companion (Alpar et al. 1982;
Bhattacharya & van den Heuvel 1991). Many of the known
MSPs reside in binary systems, generally with a low mass
white dwarf companion.

The optical emission properties of MSPs are completely
unknown, though other types of pulsars are seen in the opti-
cal band. Optical emission can be thermal, originating from
the neutron star surface, or non-thermal, originating from
particles accelerated in the magnetosphere or from X-ray
reprocessing in a circumstellar debris disk. There are about
thirty optical, ultraviolet (UV), or near-infrared identiﬁca-
tions of isolated neutron stars. Of the RPPs, pulse tim-
ing in these bands has been achieved for only ﬁve objects
(Mignani et al. 2011).

White dwarf companions dominate any optical emission
in a binary system, so most searches for MSP optical emis-
sion have focused on deep imaging of isolated MSPs. These
attempts at deep imaging have not resulted in any deﬁni-
tive optical detections (Sutaria et al. 2003; Mignani et al.

2003; Koptsevich et al. 2003; Mignani et al. 2004), although
Sutaria et al. (2003) did ﬁnd a possible mV ≈ 25 mag coun-
terpart to PSR J1024-0719. Also, Kargaltsev et al. (2004)
were able to observe UV emission from the neutron star in
the spectrum of the binary MSP J0437-4715. This UV emis-
sion was ascribed to thermal emission.

Another approach to ﬁnd optical counterparts of MSPs
is to search for pulses, using a known rotational period from
observations in radio, X-rays, or g -rays. This can be done
for pulsars in binary systems as well as for isolated pulsars.
Optical pulses have not yet been found in any MSP. Opti-
cal timing is a challenge for millisecond pulsars due to their
intrinsic faintness in the optical band and high pulsation fre-
quencies. To perform this measurement, detectors need high
time resolution and high quantum eﬃciency. There are just
a few attempts in the literature to search for pulsed opti-
cal emission from MSPs, in particular, PSR B1937+21 and
several MSPs in compact globular clusters, all with negative
results (Manchester et al. 1984; Middleditch et al. 1988).

1.1 PSR J0337+1715

PSR J0337+1715 (hereafter J0337) is an MSP that resides
in a hierarchical triple system with two white dwarves orbit-
ing it (Ransom et al. 2014). The white dwarves have masses
0.2 M⊙ (inner) and 0.4 M⊙ (outer), with orbital periods
1.6 days and 327 days, respectively. Spectroscopy of the
inner white dwarf has revealed that it has a surprisingly

2 M. J. Strader et al.

high temperature of 15800 K (Kaplan et al. 2014). Discov-
ery of the system has generated interest in using the system
to test the strong equivalence principle of general relativity
and to study the secular evolution of multi-body systems
(Ransom et al. 2014).

For our purposes, the 18th magnitude inner white dwarf
makes J0337 a convenient target for observing with our in-
strument, the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-IR Spec-
trophotometry (ARCONS; Mazin et al. 2013). The white
dwarf allows us to see the system in one second integration
images, so that we can check in real time that it is placed
on the science array away from areas of dead pixels. The
downside of course, is that the light from the white dwarf
adds to the background noise, limiting the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) that we could reach in our allotted time.

1.2 ARCONS

ARCONS utilizes a 2024 pixel array of Microwave Kinetic
Inductance Detectors (MKIDs). These devices detect indi-
vidual photons with high time resolution (2 m s) and with
energy resolution (R = E/D E ∼ 8 at 4000 ˚A). ARCONS has
a passband of 4000-11000 ˚A. The instrument was deployed at
the Coud´e focus of the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar
Observatory. ARCONS has previously been used in optical
observations of the Crab pulsar (Strader et al. 2013).

2 OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS

We observed J0337 from the 200-inch Hale Telescope for a
total of 6.7 hours on the nights of September 24, September
25, and October 21, 2014. Conditions were not photometric
on the last night. Seeing during the observations generally
ranged from 0”.8 to 1”.5. The seeing brieﬂy went up to 2”
during the last night of observation.

The ARCONS data reduction pipeline was used to ex-
tract photon lists from the raw data ﬁles (van Eyken et al.
2015). Each photon has an associated wavelength and times-
tamp. For simplicity and to avoid any unforeseen artifacts,
ﬂat and spectral response calibration weights were not ap-
plied. This means that the absolute measurement of ﬂux in
this analysis is not completely reliable. For this work, what
is important is the ﬂux of the pulsar relative to the inner
white dwarf, so this does not present a problem. We used
the pulsar timing software package TEMPO1 to barycen-
ter the photon timestamps using the JPL DE405 ephemeris
and to fold them by the 2.7 ms pulse period. Also, part of
the PRESTO package was used to parse TEMPO output
ﬁles (Ransom 2011).

To predict the pulsar rotational phase for each photon,
we use the basic timing model from Ransom et al. (2014).
This model constructs the Newtonian equations of motion
as diﬀerential equations and solves them for the motions of
the three bodies in the J0337 system. The parameters in
Ransom et al. (2014) were obtained by ﬁtting the predicted
pulse arrival times to 26280 radio pulse arrival time mea-
surements spanning 506 days, obtaining a residual scatter

of 1.34 m s. In other words, this model is capable of predict-
ing pulse arrival times to microsecond accuracy. We updated
the model by including additional observations up to 2014
October and re-ﬁtting.

The raw data from ARCONS are divided into ﬁve
minute observation ﬁles with a gap of a few seconds between
observations. Images were made from each ﬁve minute ﬁle
and were ﬁt with a circular Gaussian point spread function
(PSF) to determine an optimal aperture size for each time
period. The aperture radius was set to 1.6 times the Gaus-
sian sigma of each PSF ﬁt. Due to the uncertainty in the
ﬁts, setting the aperture size as a function of time in this
way was somewhat noisy, so the list of aperture radii was
ﬁrst smoothed with an eight-point boxcar ﬁlter.

After this the circular apertures were applied to make a
list of photons recorded within the PSF of the target object
during all the observation times. Some segments of obser-
vation time were cut, because either they were taken while
the seeing had inﬂated to 2”, the object had drifted onto
a section of dead pixels, or the object had been suddenly
moved during observation. While observing, we view real
time images from the science camera with one second in-
tegration times. Sometimes the target object was diﬃcult
to see in these images. Also, at the Coud´e focus, the ﬁeld
would slowly rotate over time. Periodically, we would move
the telescope by a few arcseconds and then back to ensure
that the target was on the intended part of the array. With
the high time resolution of ARCONS these sudden moves
could be accounted for by tracking the PSF as it moved and
adjusting the aperture position accordingly, but the amount
of data aﬀected by this was small enough that it was sim-
pler to discard it. The portions of data with worse seeing
were discarded because as the PSF is spread over more pix-
els the ratio of signal from the neutron star to background
sky counts decreases.

3 RESULTS

Once the list of photons with corresponding wavelengths and
timestamps was compiled, statistical tests could be applied
to test for periodicity under a given wavelength cut. AR-
CONS has a broad wavelength sensitivity of 4000 to 11000
˚A, but the SNR in the infrared is likely lower, so some wave-
length cut was needed to optimize our search for pulsed
emission. We tried to remove the arbitrariness of cutting
at a particular wavelength range by testing for periodicity
in many ranges, using the H test (de Jager et al. 1986). In
this test higher H values indicate more signiﬁcant periodic-
ity. The results of the wavelength search are shown in Figure
1. The highest H metric had a value of 12.3 for the narrow
wavelength range 3950 to 4350 ˚A. To ﬁnd the signiﬁcance
of this H value, we created 1000 simulated photon lists with
the same wavelengths as the real list, but with random pulse
phases. We then applied the H test with the same set of
wavelength cuts. We found that for 40.2% of the simulated
lists, there was one or more wavelength ranges that gener-
ated an H metric at least as high as 12.3. This implies that
ﬁnding an H value of 12.3 in the wavelength search had a
low signiﬁcance of 0.84 s .

For the purpose of calculating an upper limit to the
pulsed emission, we chose to use the wavelength range of

Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) g ﬁlter (Doi et al. 2010).
This allows for a rough comparison to the SDSS measured
magnitude for the inner white dwarf. The binned, folded
light curve for the three nights of observation in the wave-
length range 4000 to 5500 ˚A is shown in Figure 2. The error
bars are the square root of the total counts in the bin. We
applied a c 2 test to this light curve to test for deviation from
a ﬂat line with a value set to the average count rate. The ﬂat
line would be the expected light curve if there is no pulsed
emission. The result of the test was a c 2 value of 10.0 with
9 degrees of freedom, corresponding to a false positive prob-
ability (FPP) of 35%. This indicates that the signiﬁcance of
pulsed emission, for the choice of binning used here, is only
0.94 s .

For a bin-free test for periodicity we applied the H-
test to the folded photon timestamps. The included photons
numbered about eight million. The H test returned an H
metric of 6.04, which corresponds to an FPP of 9.1% (or
equivalently a 1.7 s
signiﬁcance). This is higher than the
binned test, but it still shows no statistically signiﬁcant de-
tection of pulsed emission.

The H test provides the number of Fourier modes that
maximizes the H metric, so that a Fourier model of a pe-
riodic signal can be constructed with these modes. For our
light curve, the H test indicated that the ﬁrst mode (i.e. a
sinusoid at the fundamental) was the most signiﬁcant. We
used simulated photon lists with pulse proﬁles of the form
of our Fourier model to estimate a 95% conﬁdence upper
limit on the pulsed optical emission. We found that in order
to have a 95% probability of observing a light curve with
an H metric of 6.04 or higher, the pulsed emission (aver-
aged over phase) would have to be at least 6.8 magnitudes
fainter than the inner white dwarf companion. Since SDSS
measures the g magnitude of the system to be 17.93 ± 0.01
(Alam et al. 2015), this sets the 95% conﬁdence upper limit
on the brightness of the pulsed emission at g ∼ 25 mag.

4 DISCUSSION

Although we found no statistically signiﬁcant periodicity,
the lightcurve in Fig 2 may show a hint of periodicity that
could be uncovered with more observing time. It would be
worthwhile to observe this object again with ARCONS or
with one of its MKID successors that are currently in devel-
opment (Meeker et al. 2016, Proc. AO4ELT, submitted).

Until there is an example of detected optical pulses in
an MSP, we have no ﬁrm basis to predict how bright pulses
would be. One generally useful value to predict the bright-
˙E
d2 , where ˙E is
ness of a pulsar is the observability metric,
the rate of change in rotational energy and d is the dis-
tance to the pulsar. This metric indicates the energy avail-
able for emission in all wavelengths from a pulsar’s slow
down, with an assumption of isotropic emission. Thompson
(2000) showed that the pulsars known at the time with
the highest observability metric were the ones with known
high energy emission (X-ray and g -rays). For J0337,
˙E
d2 =
2.0 × 1034ergs s−1kpc−2 (Ransom et al. 2014). This places
J0337 among the pulsars with higher values, of which many
are detected in X-rays (including J0337; Spiewak et al. 2016,
ApJ, accepted).

Shearer & Golden (2001) showed that the best pre-
dictor of optical brightness for the known optical pul-
sars is the strength of the B ﬁeld at the pulsar’s light
cylinder, as formulated by Pacini (1971), with revisions
in Pacini & Salvati (1983) and Pacini & Salvati (1987).
Shearer & Golden (2001) did a regression ﬁt to ﬁnd that
for the ﬁve pulsars with detected optical pulses, the optical
luminosity scales roughly with ˙E1.6. If this scaling holds true
for MSPs, then for J0337 we would expect mV ∼ 31 mag. If
this prediction is right, we will need a 30-m class telescope
to detect optical emission.

If optical pulsation could eventually be found in an MSP
with enough SNR, optical observations could be used for
pulsar timing. Zampieri et al. (2014) demonstrate how to

4 M. J. Strader et al.

compute a timing solution for the Crab pulsar using opti-
cal timing data. Optical timing would complement ongoing
radio pulsar timing arrays, because it does not suﬀer from
interstellar dispersion or scintillation and it may be able to
help characterize the sources of noise in radio timing.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a search for optical pulsations in the mil-
lisecond pulsar J0337+1715 at the pulse period seen in ra-
dio observations. No signiﬁcant pulsations were found in the
ARCONS passband 4000-11000 ˚A. In the range 4000-5500 ˚A,
we have established a 95% conﬁdence upper limit for phase-
averaged pulsed emission at 6.8 magnitudes fainter than the
inner white dwarf, which sets the limit at g ∼ 25 mag.
