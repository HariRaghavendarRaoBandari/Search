We observe and characterize intrinsic optical bistability in a dilute Rydberg vapor. The bistability
is characterized by sharp jumps between states of low and high Rydberg occupancy with jump up
and down positions displaying hysteresis depending on the direction in which the control parameter
is changed. We ﬁnd that the shift in frequency of the jump point scales with the fourth power of
the principal quantum number. Also, the width of the hysteresis window increases with increasing
principal quantum number, before reaching a peak and then closing again. The experimental results
are consistent with predictions from a simple theoretical model based on semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch
equations including the eﬀects of broadening and frequency shifts. These results provide insight to
the dynamics of driven dissipative systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Optical bistability is a well studied phenomenon, hav-
ing provided a rich contribution for the understanding of
non-equilibrium systems [1, 2]. By deﬁnition, a system
is bistable when, for the same input parameters, there
are two stable output states. The classic conditions for
observing optical bistability are a nonlinear system with
feedback [3]. Diﬀerent kinds of system have been used to
demonstrate bistability such as Fabry-Perot cavities [3],
nonlinear prisms [4], photonical crystal cavities [5], QED
cavities [6], plasmonic nanostructures [7] and nematic
liquid crystals [8]; and in general, for these examples,
an optical cavity provides the feedback to the non-linear
system.

Intrinsic optical bistability occurs when the bistable
response is present in a system without an optical cavity
and feedback is replaced by strong inter-particle interac-
tions [9]. A dynamical equilibrium is reached between the
driving of the excitation scheme and a dissipative process
in the atom-light interaction. Recently, there has been
much theoretical activity in exploring dynamics of these
driven-dissipative systems [2, 10, 11]. However, with ob-
servations to date limited to an up-conversion process
using Yb3+ ions in a solid-state crystal [12] and more re-
cently in strongly driven dilute Rydberg ensemble [13],
there is still a lack of experimental studies that would
allow detailed analysis of observed bistabilities. In this
work, we extend the experimental and theoretical study
of the optical bistability in Rydberg ensemble [13] to in-
vestigate the behavior of optical bistability and hysteresis
for a range of control parameters. By varying the princi-
pal quantum number n, of the Rydberg state, the atomic
density and the excitation laser intensity we can control
the driving and the dissipation within the system. Our
experimental observations reveal a widening of the hys-
teresis window followed by a subsequent narrowing as n is
increased. We also observe a saturation of the bistability

width dependent on the driving laser intensity. Further-
more, the results are consistent with predictions from a
surprisingly simple theoretical model based on the semi-
classical Maxwell-Bloch equations including the eﬀect of
level shifts and self-broadening originating from the in-
teractions between Rydberg atoms.

II. EXPERIMENT

The atomic excitation scheme and a schematic of the
experimental setup are shown in ﬁgure 1(a) and (b). The
Rydberg state is accessed via resonant three-photon driv-
ing [14] using a probe laser at 852 nm (Rabi frequency
Ωp) and a coupling laser at 1470 nm (Rabi frequency

Ωc) to drive the (cid:12)(cid:12)6S1/2, F = 4(cid:11) → (cid:12)(cid:12)6P3/2, F ′ = 5(cid:11) and
(cid:12)(cid:12)6P3/2, F ′ = 5(cid:11) → (cid:12)(cid:12)7S1/2, F ′′ = 4(cid:11) transitions, respec-

tively. The probe and coupling beam 1/e2 radius are 50
and 45 µm, respectively, and the beam powers are typi-
cally set in the range 20 to 70 µW. These lasers are sta-
bilized on resonance using polarization spectroscopy [15].

potential between two dipoles is Vdd ∝ d2 where dipole
moment d ∝ n2. However, other interactions, such as
ionizating collisions [18] or dipole-dipole energy transfer
[19] could have the same n scaling.

Upon stronger driving or increased atomic density,
above a critical limit, the behavior becomes more com-
plex. The interaction-induced frequency shift surpasses
the width of the optical resonance and results in a intrin-
sic optical bistability and hysteresis. Fig. 3(a) shows the
transmission of the probe beam as a function of the Ryd-
berg laser detuning for diﬀerent Rydberg states, ranging
from n = 18 (top) to n = 28 (bottom). This result
is obtained at atomic density of N = (3.0 ± 0.5) × 1011
cm−3 and Rabi frequencies Ωp/2π = (130±10), Ωc/2π =
(190±10) and Ωr/2π = (130±10)MHz. Each curve shows
positive (red) and negative (black) scan across the res-
onance for diﬀerent Rydberg levels and are normalized
to the peak transmission amplitude of the n = 18 state.
With the exception of the n = 18 state, each scan displays
obvious optical bistability with hysteresis dependent on
the direction in which resonance is approached, indicated
by arrows on the plots. Within the hysteresis region the
system can be maintained in two diﬀerent steady states
of high and low Rydberg occupancy for the same exper-
imental parameters. As n is increased the width of the
hysteresis window initially becomes larger followed by a
subsequent narrowing. The evolution of the bistability
width with n is shown in ﬁgure 4 for two diﬀerent atomic
densities N = (2.0 ± 0.5) × 1011 (purple squares) and
(3.0 ± 0.5) × 1011 cm−3 (green circles). The range of n
accessed is ultimately limited by the maximum power of

across the resonance between 7S1/2 and a Rydberg state
nP3/2. We access transitions to nP3/2 states in the range
n = 12 to 50, corresponding to a wavelength range from
882.70 to 780.03 nm, using a Ti:Sapphire laser. This
laser has a 1/e2 radius of 45 µm and the typical power
range is between 100 mW and 1 W. All lasers are co-
propagating and focused through the center of a 2 mm
Cs vapor cell. Using an interference ﬁlter, we reject the
coupling and ‘Rydberg’ light and measure the transmis-
sion of the probe beam. By means of population shelving
in the Rydberg level [16] the transmission provides an ef-
fective readout of the population in the Rydberg state.
The atomic density in the sample is controlled by vary-
ing the temperature of the cell [17], which is dynamically
stabilized.

Figure 2(a) shows the transmission of the probe beam
as a function of the Rydberg laser detuning ∆, sweep-
ing the frequency in positive (red) and negative (black)
directions. Each curve corresponds to the spectrum for
a diﬀerent nP3/2 Rydberg state with n = 34, 35 and
37. The results were obtained at atomic density of
(1.0±0.5)×1010 cm−3, with probe and coupling Rabi fre-
quency, Ωp/2π = (140±10) and Ωc/2π = (170±10) MHz.
The Rabi frequency of the ﬁnal step transition is kept
constant at Ωr/2π = (80± 10) MHz as n is changed. Un-
der these conditions we observe an asymmetric lineshape
with a sharp phase transition between the states of low
and high Rydberg occupancy, shifted to the red side of
resonance.

The behavior of the measured shift as a function of n
is shown in ﬁgure 2(b). The frequency shift of the phase
transition is seen to scale with the fourth power of the
principal quantum number (n4). This result is consistent
with an interaction shift due the strong dipole-dipole in-
teractions between Rydberg atoms, since the interaction

density we can observe a maximum value at n = 26 and
subsequent narrowing.

features of the experimental data in ﬁgure 3(a), such as
the closing of the bistability width at high density.

We therefore extend our model to include the eﬀect of
a self-broadening contribution where the total relaxation
rate is rewritten as:

III. THEORETICAL MODEL

To understand this behavior we model the system us-
ing density-matrix formalism applied to a simple two-
level system, as shown in Fig. 1(c). We consider a ground
state |gi and a Rydberg state |ri coupled by a laser with
Rabi frequency Ω and detuning ∆, where Γrg is the decay
rate from the Rydberg to the ground state. Using semi-
classical analysis, the time evolution of the system is de-
scribed by a Lindblad master equation applied for a sim-
ple two-level system [20]. Typically mean-ﬁeld theory is
used to describe the dipole-dipole interaction between the
Rydberg atoms in a classical approximation [21], where
a many-body interaction system is described in terms of
the response of a single atom interacting with a mean-
ﬁeld interaction potential. This results in renormaliza-
tion of the transition frequency ∆ → ∆eﬀ = ∆ − ∆dd,
where ∆eﬀ is an eﬀective detuning [21] and ∆dd is the
mean-ﬁeld shift which can be expressed as ∆dd = V ×ρrr,
where ρrr is the fraction of atomic population in the Ry-
dberg state and V is the interaction term corresponding
to the sum of the dipole-dipole interaction over the ex-
citation volume. Under this condition, the optical Bloch
equations (OBE) are modiﬁed and the time evolution of
the matrix elements are:

Γrg

ρgr (1a)

˙ρgr = iΩ (ρrr − 1/2) + i (∆eﬀ − Vρrr) ρgr −
˙ρrr = −ΩIm(ρgr) − Γrgρrr,
where the coherence terms ρgr = ρ∗
rg and the diagonal
population terms are related as ρgg = 1− ρrr. ρgg and ρrr
are the fraction of the atomic population in the ground
and Rydberg state, respectively. The steady-state solu-
tion can be obtained assuming ˙ρgr = ˙ρrr = 0 and solving
the set of equations (1).

(1b)

Substituting for ∆eﬀ in the steady-state solution of
Eq 1, we obtain a cubic equation for the population in
the Rydberg state:

rr = 0. (2)

This equation provides the steady-state solution for the
Rydberg population as a function of the Rydberg laser
detuning. Within the frequency range of the hysteresis
window there are three distinct solutions, one unstable
and two stable that correspond to the two steady-states
of the bistable regime. This basic model can explain
the origin of the optical bistability in the experimental
system as shown in reference [13] but does not capture

Γrg → Γrg + Γself = Γrg + βN ,

(3)

where β is the self-broadening coeﬃcient and N is the
atomic density.

Indeed,

The self-broadening eﬀect arises from the interaction
between two identical atoms in a superposition of the
ground and excited states, so that all dipole-allowed
transitions could contribute to the eﬀect.
in
our system, diﬀerent mechanisms may contribute for
the broadening eﬀect, like associative ionization [22] or
photoionization [23], also diﬀerent collisional process,
as state-mixing, for instance [24, 25], but we are not
able to distinguish each individual contribution. Self-
broadening coeﬃcients have been studied in atomic va-
pors for many years particularly for the D2 lines of alkali-
metal atoms [26, 27]. However, in this work on Rydberg
states, we expect the broadening to have a number of dif-
ference contributions. For simplicity, we apply the same
n4 scaling observed for the frequency shift also to the self-
broadening term and write the self-broadening coeﬃcient
as:

Γself = β ′n∗4N,

(4)

where n∗ is the eﬀective principal quantum number of
the Rydberg state nP3/2.

IV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

In ﬁgure 3(b) we present the results of our model and
plot Rydberg state population ρrr as a function of the
laser detuning, for several Rydberg levels. To compare
these results with the experimental data plotted in ﬁgure
3(a), the curves are normalized to the maximum trans-
mission amplitude of the n = 18 scan. For this calcula-
tion, the theoretical parameters are Ω/2π = 40 MHz and
Γrg/2π = 3 MHz. By applying an n4 scaling, the param-
eter V is found by ﬁtting the model to the experimental
results and is write as V = 8.9 × 10−14×n∗4N MHz cm3.
The results shows good qualitative agreement between
experiment and theory with respect to the amplitude of
the transmission signal and the width of the hysteresis
window. The addition of the self-broadening-like term
to the model is essential to reproduce the experimental
trends observed at higher density and stronger driving.
In ﬁgure 4, a quantitative comparison is shown. This
result shows the bistability width as a function of the
principal quantum number for two atomic densities, N =
(2.0±0.5) and (3.0±0.5)×1011 cm−3. In this picture, the
full circles and square with the error bars are the experi-
mental data, and the column bars are the theoretical re-
sults considering the self-broadening eﬀect. With the ﬁt-
ting of the ﬁgure 4 at low density (purple squares) we ﬁnd

that the ratio Ω/Ωr ≈ 1 which is expected as the transi-
tion of the two ﬁrst excitation steps are saturated. Also
ﬁtting the model to the data of ﬁgure 4, we get a value
for the broadening coeﬃcient, β ′/2π = (2.0± 0.2)× 10−9
Hz cm3, which is a key quantitative result to character-
ize the system. Comparing this result with the litera-
ture [28], we ﬁnd that β ′n4 is about an order of magni-
tude larger than the D2 line self-broadening coeﬃcient
in cesium [27] and results fouond in line-broadening ex-
periments using Doppler-free spectroscopy [29]. How-
ever these experiments were performed with lower atomic
states in contrast to our Rydberg states where the strong
interactions and multiple contributions to the broaden-
ing term is a distinguishing characteristic [23]. Our result
is in agreement with an experimental result for the self-
broadening coeﬃcient involving Rydberg states, achieved
in four-wave mixing in a Rb vapor [30].

By again ﬁnding the best ﬁt of the model to the data,

Finally, we characterize the width of the bistability
window for a ﬁxed Rydberg state (n = 28) as a function
of Rydberg laser power for three diﬀerent atomic densi-
ties shown in ﬁgure 5: N = {3.0(O); 1.0((cid:3)); 0.7(△)} ±
0.5 × 1011 cm−3. The solid lines represent the theoreti-
cal calculation for the each density. The Rabi frequency
is related to the Rydberg laser power P by Ω ∝ √P .
we ﬁnd Ω/2π = (137 ± 2) × √P which conﬁrms the
ratio Ω/Ωr ≈ 1 as Ωr/2π = (130 ± 10) × √P for the
experimental data. Also, the resultant value of the self-
broadening coeﬃcient, β ′/2π = (1.6±0.2)×10−9 Hz cm3,
is consistent with the value found in the previous ﬁtting
(ﬁgure 4). Although the theoretical model doesn’t re-
produce the oscillatory feature present in the data for
N= 1.0 ± 0.5 × 1011 cm−3, this result shows good agree-
ment especially for high density and we are able to de-
scribe the mean behavior of the bistability width.

The solid lines are the theoretical calculation using the pa-
rameters: β ′/2π = (1.6 ± 0.2) × 10−9 Hz cm3, Γrg/2π = 13.5

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have investigated intrinsic optical
bistability in cesium vapor, in a multi-photon excitation
scheme to Rydberg states. We characterized the behav-
ior of the bistability width as a function of the principal
quantum number and the Rydberg laser power for Ry-
dberg states nP3/2 with n between 18 and 37, for dif-
ferent atomic densities. We observed that the shift of
the phase transition scales as n4 and the width of the
hysteresis window exhibits a maximum value with a sub-
sequent narrowing with the increasing of the principal
quantum number and a saturation behavior as a function
of the Rydberg laser power. A theoretical model using
the OBE for a simple two level system, with modiﬁca-
tion to include eﬀects of frequency shift and broadening,
reproduce the behaviour of our experimental observation
and allows us to estimate the self-broadening coeﬃcient
for the studied Rydberg levels. We believe that the ob-
servations reported are important for ongoing studies in
Rydberg non-linear optics [31] especially those employ-
ing multi-step excitation schemes [32]. The work provides
the ﬁrst detailed characterization of system displaying in-
trinsic optical bistablity and yields insight for theoretical
descriptions of such systems. The data presented in this
paper are available [33].

ering the self-broadening eﬀect, β ′/2π = (2.0 ± 0.2) × 10−9
