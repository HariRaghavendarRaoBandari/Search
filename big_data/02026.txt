Abstract.

In this paper we report the evaluation of an optical lattice clock based
on neutral mercury down to a relative uncertainty of 1.7 × 10−16. Comparing this
characterized frequency standard to a Cs atomic fountain we determine the absolute
frequency of the 1S0 → 3P0 transition of 199Hg as νHg = 1128 575 290 808 154.62 Hz
± 0.19 Hz (statistical) ± 0.38 Hz (systematic), limited solely by the realization of the SI
second. Furthermore, by comparing the mercury optical lattice clock to a Rb atomic
fountain, we determine for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge the ratio between the 199Hg
clock transition and the 87Rb ground state hyperﬁne transition. Finally we present a
direct optical to optical measurement of the 199Hg/87Sr frequency ratio. The obtained
value of νHg/νSr =2.629 314 209 898 909 15 with a fractional uncertainty of 1.8× 10−16
is in excellent agreement with the same measurement obtained by Yamanaka et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 230801 (2015)]. This makes this frequency ratio one of the few
physical quantities agreed upon by diﬀerent laboratories to this level of uncertainty.
Frequency ratio measurements of the kind of those reported in this paper have a strong
impact for frequency metrology but also for fundamental physics as they can be used
to monitor putative variations of fundamental constants.

1. Introduction

The emergence of optical lattice (OL) clocks has sustained a trend of increasing accuracy
in the measurement of frequencies at a pace even faster than that observed since the
inception of atomic fountains twenty years ago (see [1] and references therein). The
possibility of interrogating hundreds of neutral atoms suppressing motional eﬀects in a
trap that does not perturb the clock transition measurement [2] enables new applications
of atomic clocks such as chronometric geodesy [3, 4] and poses the question of a new
deﬁnition of the SI unit of time, based on an optical transition, in very concrete terms
[5].

A paramount prerequisite for application of optical

lattice clocks to both
fundamental physics and metrology is conﬁdence in the thorough evaluation of the
systematic shifts aﬀecting the measurement of the clock frequency. Such a conﬁdence
can only be fostered by repeated comparisons with other frequency standards both in the

Comparing a mercury OL clock with microwave and optical frequency standards

microwave and in the optical domain. Among all possible frequency ratio measurements,
a particular importance has to be given to those ratios involving the present deﬁnition of
the SI second, namely Cs ground state hyperﬁne splitting, or the transitions recognized
as secondary representations of the second by the CIPM [6].

In this paper we report the measurement of three of such frequency ratios involving
lattice clock based on mercury and a primary frequency standard (Cs
an optical
fountain), and two standards based on a secondary representation of the second
operating respectively in the microwave (87Rb ground state hyperﬁne transition) and
in the optical domain (87Sr 1S0 → 3P0 transition).
In particular we report the ﬁrst
measurement of the Hg/Rb frequency ratio and the ﬁrst reproduction of a frequency
ratio between two optical clocks (Hg/Sr) to an accuracy beyond that of the realization
of the SI second and in good agreement with the previous measurement [7].

The interest of these measurements lies beyond the domain of time and frequency
metrology as these frequency ratios can be used for fundamental studies. The most
prominent example is the search for a time or gravity-related variation of the ﬁne
structure constant and of the proton to electron mass ratio (see for instance [8, 9,
10]).

The structure of the paper is the following: after describing the experimental setup
of the mercury optical lattice clock in section 2, we present in section 3 an evaluation of
systematic eﬀects aﬀecting the clock frequency measurement at the level of 1.6 × 10−16.
In section 4 we then present the frequency comparison infrastructure and the obtained
results discussing how they compare to similar measurements known in the literature.

2. The mercury optical lattice clock setup

As mentioned in the introduction, the operation of an optical lattice clock requires
cooling, trapping and interrogation of an atomic sample. One of the remarkable
properties of mercury is that all these operations can be performed with only three
laser sources. This is due to a simple level structure depicted in the inset of ﬁgure 1. A
relatively strong (Γ ≃ 2π × 1.2 MHz linewidth) intercombination transition 1S0 → 3P1
around 254 nm allows sub-Doppler laser cooling of fermion isotopes to temperatures of
∼ 30 µK in a Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) [11]. This relatively low cooling temperature
allows us to load mercury atoms in a dipole trap from a single stage MOT. The
magic wavelength for which trapping light shift is minimized is around 362 nm [12].
Trapped atoms are then probed by a clock laser tuned on the 1S0 → 3P0 doubly
forbidden intercombination line around 266 nm or 1.129 PHz. The production of these
three uncommon, deep UV laser light with suﬃcient power and reliability is the major
challenge in the design and operation of the mercury optical lattice clock.

A schematic of the clock is shown in ﬁgure 1. It consists of four subsystems: a
vacuum chamber required to provide an ultra-high vacuum environment with a residual
pressure of mercury around 10−9 mbar and the three laser subsystems mentioned before.
The vacuum apparatus of the experiment consists of two sections. The ﬁrst section

Comparing a mercury OL clock with microwave and optical frequency standards

contains the source of mercury atoms, which is a small droplet of mercury kept in
a copper tube at -40 ◦C. The second section contains the 3D-MOT and a vertically
oriented 1D optical lattice trap. The two sections are separated by a 1.5 mm diameter
12 mm long tube, which forms an atomic beam and creates diﬀerential pressure of 3
orders of magnitude between the two chambers. A detailed description of the vacuum
apparatus can be found in [13].

Figure 1: Mercury optical lattice clock experimental setup. Mercury atoms are trapped
from a thermal atomic beam and cooled in a MOT (only two pairs of beams shown).
The cooling light is generated by a laser system based on an external cavity diode laser
source (ECDL) which is frequency stabilized via saturated absorption spectroscopy in a
mercury vapor cell. The lattice trap is formed in a Fabry-Perot cavity using light from
a home made Ti:Sa laser frequency doubled in a LBO non-linear crystal. The trapped
atoms are probed by the clock light pulsed by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM), and
subsequently detected via ﬂuorescence at the cooling light frequency by an electron-
multiplied low noise CCD camera. Inset shows a level scheme of mercury, note the two
π components of the clock transition.

2.1. Cooling laser and magneto-optical trapping

Our cooling laser source at 254 nm is based on an external cavity diode laser (ECDL),
generating light at 1015 nm with a linewidth below 10 kHz on a millisecond timescale.
Approximately 15 mW of the output of the ECDL are coupled to an Yb doped ﬁber
ampliﬁer obtaining an output power in excess of 10 W. The infrared light generated by
the ampliﬁer is subsequently frequency doubled twice, ﬁrst in a single-pass conﬁguration
in a periodically poled Lithium Niobate (ppLN) crystal and then in an angle-tuned β-
barium borate (BBO) crystal in an enhancement conﬁguration, using a bow-tie cavity.
Based on our past experience with BBO crystals, the enhancement cavity and
the BBO crystal are placed in a quasi-sealed enclosure under oxygen overpressure.
This helps preventing UV-induced damage on the crystal and optical elements’ anti-
reﬂection coatings. The enclosure was made out of a single aluminium alloy block. The
geometry of the doubling cavity was chosen to have a relatively large waist of 30 µm, as
a compromise between conversion eﬃciency and long-term damage of the crystal caused
by the UV light. This turned out to be instrumental in improving the reliability of our
cooling laser source and allowed us to achieve stable and reliable generation of typically
70 mW at 254 nm. With this amount of cooling light we routinely trap ∼106 atoms in
a 3D-MOT with a loading time of 0.7 s.

The 3D-MOT is formed by the intersection of three orthogonal pairs of retro-
reﬂected beams red-detuned by 1.5 Γ with respect to the cooling transition, and a
quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld with a gradient of 150 µT/mm at the center of the trap
[14]. The MOT is formed in presence of the lattice light as the diﬀerential light shift
on the cooling transition is typically much smaller than the applied detuning. After
the MOT is formed, the cooling light and magnetic ﬁeld are turned oﬀ and atoms are
released in free fall. During this phase a low-energy fraction of the MOT atoms gets
trapped into the lattice.

2.2. Lattice trap

Our lattice trap is formed in a Fabry-Perot (FP) build-up cavity whose waist is centered
on the MOT to much better than one Rayleigh range (∼ 4 cm). Mirrors of the Fabry-
Perot cavity are mounted with indium UHV seals on the 3D-MOT chamber and are
therefore under vacuum.

Mercury has a low polarisability at the magic wavelength and therefore requires
high intensity light to create a lattice deep enough to trap atoms well in the Lamb-
Dicke regime. For a waist of 120 µm as used in our previous experiments, we obtained
up to 6 W of circulating power in the buildup cavity, limited by the available laser
power at the wavelength of 362.5 nm. This corresponds to a trap depth of about 20 Erec
where Erec ≃ h × 7.57 kHz is the kinetic energy of a mercury atom with a momentum
equal to that of a lattice photon. This rather low trap depth limited the maximum atom
number collected from the MOT to ∼ 2 × 103.

In order to increase this ﬁgure we implemented a new, deeper lattice trap. The new

Comparing a mercury OL clock with microwave and optical frequency standards

5

trap is formed inside a build-up cavity of the same length and orientation as the previous
lattice cavity, but with a mirror radius of curvature of 150 mm instead of 250 mm. The
corresponding waist of the new trap was calculated to be 69 µm. The ﬁnesse of the
new build-up cavity was measured to be about 300. The depth of the new lattice trap
corresponding to 5.5 W of circulating power was measured to be ∼ 60Erec. In agreement
with a simple model of the lattice loading process, increasing the lattice depth by a factor
of 3 resulted in a ten-fold improvement of the number of trapped atoms, up to about
2×104.

The lattice light is generated by coupling a frequency doubled titanium-sapphire
(Ti:Sa) laser to the vertical Fabry-Perot cavity. The laser is a home made non-planar
ring cavity laser and frequency doubling is obtained with a bow-tie enhancement cavity
in a lithium triborate (LBO) crystal [15]. A scheme of the lattice laser system is shown
in ﬁgure 2.

As a deeper lattice trap results in an increased lattice light shift, we implemented an
improved control scheme of the lattice wavelength working as follows. The light emitted

is frequency doubled in a LBO non-linear crystal and coupled to the lattice cavity. A
system of frequency lock based on a high precision commercial wavemeter and three
feedback loops allows us to lock the lattice cavity on the frequency of the Ti:Sa laser
and the frequency of the laser to the magic value (see text for details).

by the Ti:Sa laser is monitored by a commercial wavemeter with a frequency accuracy
of 6 MHz and a rate of 1 measurement per second. The error signal derived from this
measurement is integrated and fed to the Ti:Sa cavity length to keep its frequency at the
desired value with a typical timescale of 5 s. A fast PI controller based on an error signal
obtained with the H¨ansch-Couillaud method [16] keeps the doubling stage locked onto

Comparing a mercury OL clock with microwave and optical frequency standards

the emission of the Ti:Sa laser. In principle it would then be desirable to lock the FP
lattice cavity length on the frequency of the Ti:Sa laser to fully close the control loop,
but unfortunately the bandwidth of the mechanical actuator on the cavity is not high
enough to allow this. We therefore resort to a slightly more complicated scheme depicted
in ﬁgure 2: the relative frequency ﬂuctuations between the Ti:Sa laser and the cavity
in a band of around 10 kHz are measured by observing the transmission of the cavity at
half-fringe and compensated for by acting on the length of the Ti:Sa cavity, summing
this fast control to the slow steering obtained from the wavemeter, as described above.
The residual error signal is integrated further and fed to the FP cavity length piezo
actuator with a bandwidth of typically 30 Hz. The overall net eﬀect is that the Ti:Sa
wavelength follows the FP cavity length on the short time and vice-versa for timescales
above roughly 10 ms. The in-loop frequency ﬂuctuations of the locked lattice laser are
averaged down to less than 1 MHz at 100s.

2.3. Clock laser

Our clock laser is based on a commercial Yb ﬁber laser whose frequency is stabilized
on the main mode of a 10 cm long vertically oriented Fabry-Perot cavity with ﬁnesse
∼850 000 using the Pound-Drever-Hall method [17]. The ultra-stable light is frequency
shifted by an AOM, ampliﬁed in an injection-locked DFB laser and frequency doubled
twice in two separate enhancement cavities containing respectively a ppKTP (for 531
nm) and a BBO crystal (for 266 nm). Spectroscopy and state selection (see Section 2.4)
pulses are formed by pulsing an AOM at 180 MHz and delivered to the atoms along the
axis of the lattice trap (see ﬁgure 1). The clock laser features a frequency ﬂicker noise
ﬂoor around 4 × 10−16 and a typical frequency drift of 20 mHz/s [18]. More details can
be found in [19].

2.4. State selection, spectroscopy of the clock transition and clock operation

The improvement in trapped atom number described in section 2.2, together with the
simple level structure of mercury allowed us to implement a simple form of state selection
that is depicted in ﬁgure 3 and described in the following.

We start with the lattice trapped atoms in the ground state equally distributed
between |1S0, mF = 1/2i and |1S0, mF = −1/2i states. The ﬁrst step of the state
selection is the excitation of a single Zeeman component |1S0, mFi → |3P0, mF ′ = mFi,
with a short π-pulse of the probe light in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld of ∼ 1 G. The
second step is to apply a light pulse resonant with the cooling transition along the axis
of the trap, which expels from the trap all the atoms remaining in |1S0i. This way, only
the |3P0, mF ′ = mFi state is left populated with a purity exceeding 99%.
Using our simple state selection procedure the clock transition is detected on a
dark background, i.e. the signal comes only from |1S0i atoms which are populated by
the interrogation probe pulse. This increases the signal to noise ratio of the frequency

Figure 3: Time sequence of the spectroscopy experiment performed with state selection.
Here, the purple and yellow colors indicate the cooling and probe light respectively.
After the MOT loading phase, the MOT cooling beams and MOT coils are turned oﬀ
and a fraction of the MOT atoms are trapped in the lattice. During the state selection
phase the state |3P0i is populated by the state selection pulse. Subsequently the atoms
in the |1S0, mF = ±1/2i state are pushed away from the trap by the push beam at
254nm. After the state selection, the long spectroscopic pulse is applied. At the end of
the cycle, the MOT cooling beams and coils are turned on and the atoms are detected.

discrimination measurement as noise contributions from atoms in the |1S0,−mFi state
are removed.

After the state selection sequence is completed, we perform Rabi spectroscopy
on the π component of the clock transition starting from the prepared |3P0i state by
applying a π−pulse of the clock light and detecting atoms in the state |1S0i by collecting
ﬂuorescence emitted on the cooling transition 1S0 → 3P1. The ﬂuorescence is induced
with a molasses formed by four of the MOT beams and is digitized by the EM-CCD
camera.

2.5. Clock operation and short term stability

During clock operation, we apply a standard procedure consisting in introducing a
digital modulation of the probe frequency, applying a π Rabi pulse and correcting the
probe frequency shift by a quantity proportional to the integrated diﬀerence between
two subsequent ﬂuorescence measurements. At equilibrium the unmodulated probe
frequency is thereby servoed to the mercury transition frequency [20].

In order to evaluate systematic eﬀects, we use a technique of digital

lock-in
detection. Up to four independent integrators operating in the same way as the one
described above are run in an interleaved manner. Each integrator runs for a period
of few cycles and for each integrator we use a diﬀerent value of the clock parameters
set. The frequency diﬀerence between the diﬀerent integrator outputs yields information
about the physics of the clock relatively to the modulated parameter(s) while the other

Comparing a mercury OL clock with microwave and optical frequency standards

parameters are kept constant. This allows us to measure diﬀerent systematic frequency
biases of the clock frequency while rejecting almost all the other perturbations as they
are common mode for the diﬀerent conﬁgurations.

However, due to cyclic operation of the clock with typically only 10% of the
time spent interrogating the atoms, frequency ﬂuctuations of the clock laser cannot be
completely eliminated but are aliased into the measurement bandwidth increasing the
frequency noise and therefore limiting the short term stability of the clock (Dick eﬀect,
see [21]). As during interleaved operation the cycle time to obtain a single measurement
is increased, the eﬀective instability of the interleaved measurement is increased with
respect to normal clock operation. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 4 where we plot the
Allan standard deviation during normal clock operation (blue), and when computing
the diﬀerence between the two π-components of the clock transition (see ﬁgure 1) with
a sampling period of two clock cycles (red). In spite of the slightly degraded stability,
the measurement averages down to a 1 × 10−16 statistical uncertainty in about 700 s,
allowing for measurements below the ﬂicker ﬂoor of the cavity (see section 2.3).

Figure 4: Overlapping Allan standard deviation of the mercury clock center frequency
for a typical measurement run, when referenced to the ULE cavity. Gray dots represent
the raw data, while the blue dots are corrected for the linear drift of the cavity. The blue
dashed line is a model used to ﬁt the dedrifted data : σy(τ ) = qσ2

where σwhite(τ ) = 1.3 × 10−15 × τ −1/2 represents white frequency noise, and σﬂicker(τ ) =
4 × 10−16 is the ﬂicker ﬂoor of the ULE cavity. Red squares are overlapping Allan
standard deviation of the frequency diﬀerence between the two Zeeman sublevels. This
stability is representative of a diﬀerential measurement where the probe frequency is
modulated every 2 cycles of the clock. The red dashed line corresponds here to a
stability of σ(τ ) = 3.4 × 10−15 × τ −1/2.

3. Uncertainty budget

In this section we describe the evaluation of the physical perturbations aﬀecting the
clock frequency measurement. This evaluation is paramount in order to be able to
evaluate the frequency comparisons against other frequency standards presented in the
next section.

The main perturbations aﬀecting the mercury clock frequency measurement are
those related to the trap AC Stark shift, the external magnetic ﬁeld, the thermal
radiation (black body radiation shift, BBR), the atomic density in the trap, and the
pulsed interrogation.

3.1. Lattice light shift

We ﬁrst consider the eﬀect of the trapping light on the clock transition. If trapping
the atoms in a lattice allows for cancellation of Doppler and other motional eﬀects, it
comes at the price of introducing an AC Stark shift on the clock levels, and in turn a
frequency shift of the clock transition. As ﬁrst pointed out in [2], tuning the frequency
of the trapping light to the so-called “magic frequency” νmagic for which the scalar
polarizabilities of the clock states are equal allows for a cancellation to ﬁrst order of this
frequency shift. Furthermore as 199Hg has spin 1/2, the tensor component of diﬀerential
polarizabilities are zero by symmetry.

Given the relatively small trap depth available in our experiment (see section 2.2)
and the predicted value of non-linear terms for mercury [22], we expect that non-linear
lattice shifts will not be resolved at our present resolution. We therefore analyzed the
data according to a linear model of the lattice light shift (see [22]):

(νl − νmagic) Ul =

∂∆κs

where ∆αs(ν) = αs
1S0(ν) is the diﬀerence between the values of scalar
polarizabilities of the ground and excited states of the clock at the operating frequency
of the lattice νl, and Ul is the operating depth of the lattice.

We study this eﬀect using digital lock-in detection having two integrators running on
each one of the π-components of the clock transition at the nominal depth UREF = 56Erec
and a second pair of integrators running at a diﬀerent depth Ul between 50 and 25Erec.
The linear combination

∆ν = 1/2 hνm(π+, UREF) + νm(π−, UREF) − νm(π+, Ul) − νm(π−, Ul)i ,

where νm(π, U) is the clock frequency measured by the integrator operating on the π
component at the depth U, is a measure of ∆νLLS(νl, UREF)−∆νLLS(νl, Ul). We note that
the measured ∆ν is insensitive to lattice vector shift, and to magnetic ﬁeld instabilities
to ﬁrst order (see section 3.4).

By repeating these integrations for diﬀerent lattice frequencies, we obtain the

dataset plotted in ﬁgure 5, as a function of the diﬀerence UREF − Ul.

recoil energy. The detuning (in MHz) from 826 855 533 MHz corresponding to each
curve is shown on the plot with matching color. The dotted lines show the result of a
ﬁt of the whole dataset with a linear model

we also plot a ﬁt of the whole dataset with the function: ∆ν = a(νl− νmagic)(UREF − Ul)
with free parameters a and νmagic.
From the ﬁt we extract the values ∂∆κs/∂ν(νmagic) = a = −1.25(7) ×

10−4 Hz/Erec/MHz and an estimation of the magic frequency νmagic = 826 855 539(21) MHz,
an improvement by more than two orders of magnitude with respect to our previous
determination [23] and in agreement with the measurement from [7]. A χ2 test yields
a probability of 0.96 for the ﬁt, which gives us conﬁdence that higher order terms are
indeed not resolved at our present level of uncertainty.

In order to support this claim and to take at least partially into account the non-
linear terms, we evaluated the lattice light shift with the complete model presented
in reference [22] using the theoretical estimation of coeﬃcients of the non-linear terms
and our experimental determination of the linear ones. From this non-linear model we
generate datapoints at the values of detuning and lattice depth probed experimentally
and perform a linear analysis in the same way as we do for the experimental data. We
check then that the values of a and νmagic obtained are consistent with the experimental
ones.

From the measured coeﬃcients, evaluating our linear model at our nominal trap
depth of 56 Erec and taking into account the uncertainty of the wavemeter used to lock
the trapping laser to the magic wavelength (see section 2.2), we infer a lattice light shift
of 4 × 10−17 with an uncertainty of 1.38 × 10−16. Using the full model of ref.
[22], as
developed above, we evaluate the contribution of non-linear terms as −6 × 10−17 with
an uncertainty of 3.6 × 10−17 including a (conservative) 50% relative uncertainty on the

Comparing a mercury OL clock with microwave and optical frequency standards

11

theoretical non-linear coeﬃcients and 15 µK uncertainty on the atomic temperature in
the lattice.

In the following we therefore apply a typical relative correction for lattice light shift
of 2× 10−17 with a total uncertainty of 1.43× 10−16, dominated by the linear term. This
is the largest contribution to our total uncertainty budget.

3.2. Blackbody radiation shift (BBR)

The black body radiation (BBR) shift is due to diﬀerential AC Stark shift of the clock
levels due to the electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium with the environment
of the atomic sample. The frequency shift induced by the environment at a temperature
T can be written as

δνBBR = −

2σ
hǫ0c

∆αsT 4(1 + ηT 2)

(2)

where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, ∆αst is the static diﬀerential polarizability
between the excited and the ground state, and η is the so-called dynamical coeﬃcient.
Based on the frequencies of the relevant transitions we expect that Hg should behave
similarly to Yb for which ηT 2 < 0.02 [24]. The resulting frequency shift and associated
uncertainty are therefore expected to be below 1 × 10−17 and therefore negligible with
respect to the present uncertainty over the static term.

As BBR shift is the most signiﬁcant item in the uncertainty budget of the best
optical lattice clocks based on Sr [25], [26], [27] or Yb [28] atoms, much eﬀort has
been made in tackling this eﬀect in the literature. This includes ultra-precise radiation
thermometry [29], radiation shielding [24], or cryogenic setups [30].

In the case of Hg, the sensitivity to this eﬀect is much smaller than for Sr (30
times) or Yb (16 times), and therefore controlling this shift down to the 10−17 level
of uncertainty only requires the knowledge of the thermal environment of the atoms
at the level of a few kelvins.
In order to evaluate both temperature and thermal
gradients in the environment seen by the atoms, we have put three Pt100 sensors in
contact with the vacuum chamber. These sensors show good agreement, with measured
temperature diﬀerences not higher than 1K . Assuming a 10% uncertainty on the
diﬀerential polarizability [31] and with a measured temperature around the atoms of
(301.0 ± 1.5) K, we get a shift of −1.6 × 10−16 with an uncertainty of 2 × 10−17.

3.3. Collision shift

Collision shift is a prominent contribution to many atomic clocks uncertainty budgets.
It is the main limitation to the accuracy of the best Cs [8] and Rb [32] microwave
frequency standards and has been observed in both Sr [33] and Yb [28] optical lattice
clocks.

We have used two diﬀerent methods to modulate the probed atom number between
a high density (HD) and a low density (LD) conﬁguration in order to evaluate the
collisional shift.

since the diﬀerential method must give zero shift at zero modulation of the parameters.
The 1σ conﬁdence interval is given by the magenta dotted lines on each curve. The
vertical red dashed line corresponds to the typical operating point of the clock.

In a ﬁrst series of measurements, we modulate the duration of the state selection
pulse duration (see section 2.4), while keeping the power constant, thereby changing
the fraction of atoms excited to the 3P0 state. The results are presented on ﬁgure 6(a)
and summarized in table 1. The extrapolated shift for the nominal atom number is
(−1.6 ± 1.4) × 10−16. In order to check for the presence of a bias in this technique such
as a phase transient in the AOM used to shape the state selection pulse or a non-linear
change in the density distribution with the atom number, we perform a second series of
measurement by varying the loading time of the MOT.

The results are shown in ﬁgure 6(b) and summarized in table 1. The extrapolated

shift for the employed atom numbers is −2(7) × 10−17.

Table 1 sums up the results for the two methods, extrapolating the results to our
nominal operating atom number of ≃ 900 atoms probed in the lattice. As we do not
have any reason to favour one method over the other, we combine all the data treating
it as a single dataset. Fitting with a linear function, we ﬁnd a shift of −5.2(6.4)× 10−17,

compatible with zero within a 1σ uncertainty.

Another source of systematic uncertainty related to atom-atom interactions are
background collisions. We evaluate this shift by applying the theory of ref.
[34] using
the measured fraction of detected atoms and mercury properties from refs.
[35, 36].
We obtain a shift of −2 × 10−17. However as the applicability of the approximations
relevant to the theory are only weakly veriﬁed, we decide not to apply any correction
and include background collisions in our uncertainty budget with a 100% uncertainty.

3.4. Zeeman shifts

The eﬀect of an external magnetic ﬁeld on the clock transition is to introduce a frequency
shift on the π components given by

∆νmag = mF gF µBBz − βZB2

z

where gF is the gyromagnetic factor of the transition, µB is the Bohr’s magneton in
frequency units, βZ is the 2nd order Zeeman coeﬃcient and Bz is the projection of
the ﬁeld along the polarization of the probe beam. Using spectroscopic measurements
we have mapped and subsequently zeroed the magnetic ﬁeld at the atom site with
a resolution of 3 µT in all three directions of space. We then apply a quantization
magnetic ﬁeld Bz ≃ 280 µT parallel to the probe polarization to split the two π Zeeman
components of the transition.

Similarly to what we did for lattice light shifts (see section 3.1) we perform digital
lock-in detection running four independent integrators, one pair operating at a reference
bias ﬁeld BREF and locking on each of the two π components, and another pair operating
at a variable bias ﬁeld Bbias also on the two π components of the transition. For each
integrator pair we then construct the two quantities:

νm(B) = 1/2(νm(π+, B) + νm(π−, B))
∆ν(B) = νm(π+, B) − νm(π−, B)

which are related to the relevant physical parameters by:
bias − B2
= gF µBB + ∆V S,

νm(Bbias) − νm(BREF) = − βZ(B2
∆ν(B)

REF)

(3)

(4)

where ∆V S is the vector component of the lattice light shift.

A measurement of this last quantity can be obtained by analyzing the data
presented in section 3.1 extracting the splitting between the two π components as a
function of the lattice depth. At the nominal trap depth we obtain ∆V S ≃ 15Hz ≪
∆ν(Bbias), indicating a residual ellipticity of the probe beam of about 3% if we use the
vector polarizability given in [31].

Neglecting the vector light shift, we can use the measurement of ∆ν(B) as an in

situ calibration of the magnetic ﬁeld and we get the quadratic Zeeman shift

∆νQZS =

βZ

(gF µB)2 (∆ν(BREF )2 − ∆ν(Bbias)2).

We plot in ﬁgure 7 the so constructed diﬀerential shift of the center frequency of the
clock transition as a function of the diﬀerence of the square of the splittings for the two
interleaved conﬁgurations.

Figure 7: Quadratic Zeeman shift as a function of the square of the splitting between
the two π components. The plain black line is a linear ﬁt to the data, and the two
black dotted lines represent 1σ conﬁdence intervals on the ﬁt. The red dotted line is
our nominal operating point.

From the slope of a ﬁt to the data according to eq. 5, we obtain the atomic
coeﬃcient γZ = βZ(gF µB)−2. We ﬁnd γZ = 1.1(6)× 10−7 Hz−1, resulting in a frequency
shift of −8.2×10−17 at our nominal splitting of 926 Hz with an uncertainty of 4.8×10−17,
limited by the statistics of the measurement.

3.5. Clock pulse frequency chirp

The clock pulses are created using an AOM driven at the frequency of 180 MHz (see
Figs. 1 and 8(a)). The RF power dissipated in the AOM can cause phase transients
in the AOM, in turn resulting in a frequency shift [37]. We realize an interferometric
measurement of this phase transient by analyzing in the time domain the beatnote
between the interrogation pulses and a CW beam passing through another identical
AOM. A schematic of the measurement setup is shown in ﬁgure 8(a).

Typical results of the reconstructed phase transient are shown in ﬁgure 8(b) for
several RF driving powers of the AOM, averaged over 654 cycles of the clock. Taking
the slope from such plot and averaging over several realizations we can evaluate the
dφ
frequency shift associated with the phase transients of the probe light ∆νprobe = 1
dt ,
2π
which is plotted in Figure 8(c) with matching colors. At the operating point of the clock
of 170 mW of RF power fed into the AOM (optimized to create clock interrogation π

Comparing a mercury OL clock with microwave and optical frequency standards

15

pulses of ≈ 100 ms), we obtain a shift consistent with zero with an uncertainty below
10−17.

3.6. Final uncertainty budget

A summary of the evaluated frequency shifts on the mercury 1S0 → 3P0 transition and
of the associated corrections which we apply to get the unperturbed frequency of the
clock is given in table 2. Summing uncertainty contributions quadratically, we get the
total fractional uncertainty on the clock transition frequency as 1.7 × 10−16, a factor 30
improvement over our last reported uncertainty [23] and only a factor of 2 higher than
the recent evaluation of a similar system [7].

4. Frequency ratio measurements

In this section we report the results of a frequency comparison between the mercury
optical lattice clock described in the previous section and three diﬀerent frequency
standards. A primary frequency standard, an atomic fountain based on Cs (FO2-Cs)
with an accuracy of 2.4 × 10−16 [8], and two secondary standards, one atomic fountain
operating on the microwave ground state hyperﬁne splitting in 87Rb at 6.8 GHz (FO2-
Rb, uncertainty 2.9 × 10−16 [32]) and a lattice clock operating on the visible 1S0 → 3P0
transition in 87Sr at 429 THz (Sr2, uncertainty 4.1 × 10−17).

The comparison setup is sketched in ﬁgure 9. The optical clocks are located in two
diﬀerent laboratories in the same building. A fraction of the probe light of each clock is
sent via optical ﬁbers to a ﬁber comb located in a third laboratory. At the end of both
links a small amount of light is reﬂected and coupled back to the ﬁbers. The reﬂected
light is beat with the input light and the beatnote is used for ﬁber noise cancellation.
The ﬁber comb also has a frequency stabilized link to the H-maser+cryogenic sapphire
oscillator (CSO) ensemble. The beatnote of the clock light and an appropriate comb
tooth for each clock is measured and counted in the ﬁber comb laboratory against the H-
maser reference. As the beatnotes for the two optical clocks are counted simultaneously

Figure 8: (a) Scheme of the AOM phase-transient measurement setup. Two synthesizers
are used to drive the clock and the reference arm AOMs, respectively at 180 and 180.1
MHz. The pulses are created via a TTL signal sent to the clock AOM. We take a small
amount of clock light at 266 nm from the output of the second harmonic generation
cavity thanks to a beam-sampler (BS). This light is sent to the reference AOM (Ref
AOM), while the remaining light goes through the usual clock beam path and is pulsed
through the Clock light AOM. The measurement and reference arm are overlapped
thanks to a polarizing beam-splitter (PBS) and sent to a photodiode. The resulting
beatnote at 100kHz is acquired with a digital oscilloscope and the phase is extracted
by performing digital I/Q demodulation. Two splitters and a mixer provide the phase
reference for the demodulation.

it is possible to compute the frequency ratio in a way that rejects the H-maser noise to
better than 10−20.

Data of the simultaneous measurements of the H-maser frequency against the Cs
and Rb fountains was provided by the fountain laboratory. This allowed us to perform
a frequency comparison of our Hg clock with the microwave frequency standards.

The results of the comparison presented below take into account the gravitational
redshift due to a height diﬀerence of 4.25(2) m (4.17(2) m) between the Hg clock and
the Cs (Rb) fountain, calculated based on a leveling campaign carried out in 2013. The
gravitational red shifts introduced by the height diﬀerence of 3(1) cm between the Hg
and Sr clocks (Hg lying higher than Sr) contribute to less than 10−17.

Figure 9: Mercury and Strontium optical lattice clocks frequency comparison scheme.
Part of the probe light of each clock is sent to the ﬁber comb via frequency stabilized
optical links. The ﬁber comb is also connected to the maser+CSO ensemble via a
frequency stabilized link, locked to the Cs and Rb fountains. The comb simultaneously
measures all the frequencies. Notice that the comb measures the frequency of the Hg
clock in the infra-red and not in the UV. The Hg and Sr clocks were not synchronized
during the comparison.

4.1. Mercury versus microwave standards

Comparison data in the microwave domain are shown in Figure 10 where we plot the
overlapping Allan standard deviation of the measured frequency ratio for Cs and Rb
respectively.

The observed frequency stabilities are compatible with white frequency noise at
6×10−14τ −1/2 for Cs, and 4.5×10−14τ −1/2 for Rb, fully limited by the short-term stability
of the fountains. By considering a total measurement duration of about 39.4 hours over
10 days, limited by the up-time of the mercury clock, we obtain statistical uncertainties
of 1.7 × 10−16 and 1.3 × 10−16 respectively for Cs and Rb.

Figure 10: Overlapping allan deviation of the frequency ratio between Hg and FO2-Cs
(a) and Hg and FO2-Rb (b). The dotted lines represent the stabilities of the fountains
(limited by the quantum projection noise) over the length of the measurement campaign,
averaging as 1/√τ .

From the Hg/Cs frequency comparison we obtain the value of the frequency
ratio 122 769.552 729 311 011±45 × 10−12 where the total uncertainty is the sum of
three contributions: the systematic uncertainty on the mercury clock, the accuracy
of the Cs fountain and of the frequency comb and the statistical uncertainty over
the ratio measurement. By deﬁnition of the SI second, the Hg/Cs ratio gives us the
value of the absolute frequency of the 1S0 → 3P0 transition in neutral mercury as
νHg = 1128 575 290 808 154.62 Hz ±0.19 Hz (statistical) ±0.38 Hz (systematic including
Cs accuracy). As can be seen in Figure 12(a), this value is in excellent agreement with
the previous value measured in our lab in 2012 [23, 38] and the accuracy is improved by
roughly a factor of 20.

Comparing a mercury OL clock with microwave and optical frequency standards

19

Our Hg/Rb comparison is the ﬁrst direct measurement of the ratio of the two clock
frequencies. We obtain the value 165 124.754 879 997 258±62×10−12 , where the quoted
relative uncertainty of 3.7× 10−16 includes both statistical and systematic uncertainties.
Using the measured Hg/Rb ratio we can obtain another absolute frequency measurement
of the frequency of the mercury transition by noting that νHg = (νHg/νRb)×(νRb/νCs)νCs.
Using the best known experimental value for the Rb/Cs ratio [32] which provided the
recommended value of the Rb secondary representation of the second [6], we obtain
νHg = 1 128 575 290 808 154.19 Hz ±0.15 Hz (stat) ±0.40 Hz (syst).

4.2. Mercury versus strontium optical frequency ratio

The results of the νHg/νSr direct optical-to-optical
frequency comparison via the
frequency comb are shown in the inset of Figure 11 averaged over 200 s wide bins.
The total overlapped up-time of the two clocks is 36.6 hours. The Allan deviation of
these data is shown in Figure 11. As expected the stability is much better than in the
microwave to optical comparison and is consistent with white frequency noise at the
level of 4 × 10−15 at 1 s up to roughly 2 hours, and then with frequency ﬂicker noise
around 5 × 10−17, below the present accuracy of the Hg lattice clock.

Figure 11: Overlapping Allan deviation of the frequency ratio between Hg and Sr. the

dotted magenta line represents 4 × 10−15/√τ and the dotted black line the accuracy of

the mercury clock as evaluated in section 3. In the inset we plot the time series of the
frequency comparison measurement. Each dark blue dot represents the average of the
measured quantity over 200 consecutive clock cycles.

We obtain the value νHg/νSr = 2.62931420989890915 ± 4.6 × 10−16. The quoted
uncertainty (1.8 × 10−16 in relative units) is the sum of statistical and systematic

Comparing a mercury OL clock with microwave and optical frequency standards

20

uncertainties and is dominated by the systematics of the mercury lattice clock as
evaluated in section 3 since the Sr clock contributes for only 4.1 × 10−17. The obtained
value is in good agreement with the value measured in [7].

where νREF = ν2012. The horizontal black dotted line is the weighted mean of the two
values. (b) fractional change for the ratio νHg/νSr when comparing this work with the
RIKEN measurement. We have plotted here (R − RREF)/RREF for both the SYRTE
(violet) and RIKEN (black) values, where RREF = RRIKEN. The horizontal black dotted
line is the weighted mean of the two values.

4.3. Summary of results

The three clock frequency ratios measured in this work are listed in table 3. The
νHg/νRb frequency ratio is reported for the ﬁrst time. To our knowledge the νHg/νSr
frequency ratio is now one of the best known physical quantities measured independently
in diﬀerent laboratories, on-par with the νSr/νCs ratio measured both at SYRTE [27]
and at PTB [26] with an accuracy in the low 10−16 range.

valuable inputs for the long term evaluation of optical frequency standards in view
