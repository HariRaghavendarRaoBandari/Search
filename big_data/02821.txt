We begin this review with an introduction and a discussion of Weyl fermions as emergent particles
in condensed matter systems, and explain how high energy phenomena like the chiral anomaly can
be seen in low energy experiments. We then explain the current interest in the ﬁeld due to the
recent discovery of real materials which behave like Weyl semi-metals. We then describe a simple
lattice model of a topological insulator, which can be turned into a Weyl semi-metal on breaking
either time-reversal or inversion symmetry, and show how ﬂat bands or Fermi arcs develop. Finally,
we describe some new phenomena which occur due to the chiral nature of the Weyl nodes and end
with possible future prospects in the ﬁeld, both in theory and experiment.

INTRODUCTION

In recent times, the Landau paradigm of classiﬁcation of states through the principle of spontaneous symmetry
breaking and local order parameters has been superseded by the classiﬁcation through topology or global properties
of the many-body ground state wave-function of the system[1]. These topological phases have some property to which
an integer can be assigned, which is robust and depends only on global properties. They cannot be destroyed by local
perturbations such as disorder and scattering, as long as the bulk gap is not closed, although they can have surface
metallic states - in fact, surface metallic states are what distinguishes them from ordinary insulating phases.

The ﬁrst, most famous example of a topological phase is the integer quantum Hall eﬀect[2]. This was a system
of electrons moving in two dimensions, with a strong perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld (time-reversal broken system).
This led to Landau levels and most importantly, to the quantisation of the transverse conductance with remarkable
accuracy. It was soon realised that this eﬀect had a topological explanation[3] - the physically measured transverse
current was related to a topological invariant, the ﬁrst Chern number, which is just the integral of the Berry curvature
over the Brillouin zone. The topological phase on each plateau was protected by a bulk gap, and the current was
carried by metallic surface or edge states.

However, for a long time, this did not have much impact on material science, because quantum Hall eﬀect occurred at
low temperatures and at very high magnetic ﬁelds. There was a lattice model proposed by Haldane[4] which suggested
that materials could have topologically nontrivial band structures, characterised by non-zero Chern numbers, even
without an external magnetic ﬁeld. But it is only in the last decade or so that it was realised that this could occur
in realistic materials. Consequently, there has been an explosion of work on topological materials[5]. The hallmark
of these materials was that they were insulating in the bulk, but they could conduct electricity through metallic
surface states, without magnetic ﬁeld or breaking time-reversal invariance. Hence, unlike the quantum Hall phases,
these materials had to have a pair of counter-propagating edge states due to time-reversal invariance. Also, unlike
the quantum Hall phases, they could occur in three dimensions as well as in planar systems. Furthermore, in these
systems, the edge or surface states had relativistic dispersions and hence, the physics of Dirac fermions became relevant
in these materials.

But more recently, it has been realised that gaplessness is not an essential ingredient for topological protection.
Band topology can be deﬁned, even if the gap closes at some points in the Brillouin zone. A particular example of
such a phase is the Weyl semi-metal phase[6], which was ﬁrst predicted in the pyrochlore iridates[7]. It is a new state
of matter, whose low energy excitations are Weyl fermions. Unlike the topological insulators, these materials have
gapless states in the bulk as well as the boundary.

II. EMERGENT WEYL FERMIONS IN CONDENSED MATTER SYSTEMS

The idea that particles with relativistic dispersion can be quasiparticles in condensed matter systems is not new
and goes back to the early days of the study of Luttinger liquids[8], where it was realised that close to the Fermi
energy, the dispersion could be linearised and obeyed relativistic energy-momentum relations.

More recently, relativistic Dirac fermions came into prominence with the discovery of graphene[9] in 2+1 dimensions.
Graphene is a single sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. Electrons moving around the carbon
atoms interact with the periodic potential of the honeycomb lattice to give rise to a Fermi surface with six double
cones where the valence and conductance bands touch each other. (Out of these six, only two are independent). Close

to these nodes, the dispersion is linear and the Hamiltonian is given by the massless relativistic Dirac equation, with
the speed of light replaced by the Fermi velocity and the spin replaced by the pseudo-spin of the sub-lattices -

H = vF (σxpx + σypy) .

(1)

2

The wave-functions are two component spinors with the spinor index refering to the sublattice index and real spin
being an additional quantum number. vF is the Fermi velocity in the solid, which replaces the speed of light in
relativistic systems. The low energy excitations about the nodes are gapless (graphene is metallic). However, in
principle, they can be gapped out by perturbations (mass terms) proportional to σz. The stability of graphene
comes from the extra symmetries under time-reversal and spatial inversion[10], which enforces the vanishing of terms
proportional to σz and hence implies that no gap is induced, as long as perturbations do not break time-reversal and
inversion symmetry.

A possible generalisation of this to 3+1 dimensions is to write down the massless 3+1 Dirac Hamiltonian given by

(2)

(cid:18) 0

H =

vF (cid:126)σ · p

(cid:19)

vF (cid:126)σ · p

0

This is equivalent to having two doubly degenerate Dirac cones at the same point in momentum space. This is
what has been dubbed as a Dirac semi-metal[11]. This semi-metal can also be gapped out easily by adding mass
terms proportional to a diagonal 4 × 4 matrix (I2×2,−I2×2). However, the Dirac points can be protected by crystal
symmetries, and provided that the perturbations or imperfections which exist do not break this symmetry, semi-
metallic phases can be observed.

However, it is possible to split the degeneracy of the Dirac node in momentum space or energy space by breaking
either time-reversal or inversion symmetry. This gives rise to two Weyl nodes with opposite chiralities (or helicities),
whose dispersion is given by the massless Weyl Hamiltonian. The basic idea[6] behind the existence and stability of
these Weyl nodes is very simple. Close to the degeneracy points where two non-degenerate bands touch each other
and the energy is cone-like, the electronic excitations are described by the Weyl equation, simply because the eﬀective
Hamiltonian at that point has to have two dimensions, and besides the identity, there are only three anti-commuting
σ matrices. More explicitly, the low energy Hamiltonian for a two band model is given by

H = a(k) + σ · b(k) .

(3)

where σ = (σx, σy, σz) are the three Pauli matrices. We can now expand the Hamiltonian around the touching or
gapless points (k = k0) in the Brillouin zone to get

H(k (cid:39) k0) (cid:39) const + σ · b(k0) + σ · ∂bi

∂kj (k=k0)

(k − k0) .

(4)

This is precisely the Weyl Hamiltonian (though oﬀset and anisotropic) and the wave-functions are two component
Weyl fermions with positive or negative chirality. These band-touching points or nodes can move around in the
momentum space, by perturbations that change the Hamiltonian slightly, but the only way for them to gap out
and disappear is if they meet another node with the opposite chirality. This is very diﬀerent from what happens in
graphene. In fact, a straighforward generalisation of the graphene Hamiltonian to 3+1 dimensions can also be made
simply by adding a term proportional to σz to obtain

H = σxpx + σypy + σzpz

(5)

which is just the isotropic form of the model given in Eq.4 and is the familiar Weyl Hamiltonian in relativistic systems.
Here, there is no fourth anti-commuting matrix to add a mass term. Perturbations can only move the nodes, but
cannot gap them out. Hence, we have gapless fermions with a single chirality at each band touching point.

Surprisingly, it was found, initially through detailed calculations[7, 12, 13], that there are condensed matter mate-
rials, whose band structure shows nodes or points around which the excitations are Weyl fermions. These materials
were dubbed Weyl semi-metals (WSM)[14]. They also have very unusual surface states called Fermi arcs, which
terminate at the location of the bulk Weyl nodes, which we will discuss in detail later.

As was already mentioned, in a system with both inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry intact, one always
gets Dirac nodes - both left and right handed chiral nodes, at the same point, in which case it is always possible to
add a mass term using the fourth anti-commuting four component γ matrix and gap it out. So to get Weyl nodes in
the condensed matter system, one needs to break either inversion symmetry or time-reversal symmetry.

The stability of the Weyl nodes can also be connected to a topological quantum number, which is the conservation
of the total charge of the Weyl nodes. As we said above, a single Weyl node cannot disappear by itself. It has to

annihilate with a Weyl node of the opposite charge. This also means that for the Weyl nodes to have well-deﬁned
coordinates, momentum has to be a good quantum number, so translational invariance has to be unbroken. So
disorder has to be fairly weak.

Also, Weyl nodes can be thought of as monopoles in momentum space. The charge of the Weyl node can be related
to the quantised Berry ﬂux, which can be computed from the momentum space wave-functions of the ﬁlled states
near the Weyl node. It turns out to be ±2πκ depending on the chirality of the node (positive or negative) and the
‘monopole’ charge κ[6]. The topological stability of the Weyl node is thus related to the Gauss law, which keeps the
total ﬂux inside a given surface invariant. The Weyl node can only vanish when it annihilates with another Weyl node
with opposite chirality. Also, since the net charge of all the Weyl nodes inside a Brilloiuin zone has to be zero, the
Weyl nodes always come in pairs and the minimum number of Weyl nodes that one can have in any model is two[15].

III. THE ‘HIGH ENERGY’ CONNECTION

The distance between high energy physics and condensed matter physics has been decreasing in recent years, with
the so-called (AdS-CFT) Anti-de Sitter- Conformal Field theory (or even AdS-CMT for condensed matter theory)
connection[16]. But in the ﬁeld of Dirac materials, the connection is much more direct and the idea that quasiparticles
can be relativistic fermions is quite old[8]. Moreover, with the discovery of topological materials, there has been a
possibility of seeing even Majorana modes (not exactly Majorana fermions, but related) and now Weyl fermions in
low energy condensed matter settings. We will discuss the discovery of these Weyl fermions in the next section, but
in this section, we will see how phenomena such as the chiral anomaly related to Weyl fermions gets translated in the
condensed matter context.

The basic idea of the chiral anomaly is that the conservation laws ∂µjµ = 0 and ∂µjµ

5 = 0 cannot be simultaneously
satisifed. So if we take the conservation of current to be sacrosanct, the current of the left and right chirality fermions
cannot be individually conserved. The Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly equation[17]

thus leads to breaking of the chiral symmetry by the anomaly. In the Weyl semi-metal context, these equations can
be rewritten as

∂µjµ

5 = F F ∗/8π2

∂t (nR + nL) = 0, =⇒ ∂
∂t (nR − nL) = ± e2

∂t (nR − nL) (cid:54)= 0,
h2 E · B,

∂

(7)

where nR and nL denote the number of fermions at the right and left chirality Weyl nodes. This implies that by
applying parallel electric and magnetic ﬁelds, we can change the diﬀerence in their numbers, or if we have really
have an isolated Weyl node, we can change the number of particles. This is essentially a quantum mechanical eﬀect
because the path integral for Weyl fermions coupled to an electromagnetic ﬁeld is not invariant under independent
gauge transformations of the left and right chiral ﬁelds. So single chirality fermions implies charge non-conservation.
However, in any real system, one always has total particle number conservation. Hence, Weyl nodes in any crystal
always have to come in pairs. Due to the anomaly term, we can get charge pumping between the nodes - nR decreases
and nL increases or vice-versa, at a rate given by the anomaly. But the total number of particles remains the same.
This is called the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem[15] .

More formally, by coupling the Weyl fermions to an external electromagnetic ﬁeld and computing the eﬀective
action by integrating out the fermions, it can be shown that the time-reversal or parity breaking parameter in the
model leads to an eﬀective θ term in the action given by

(we are using 4 vector notation here and µ runs from 0 to 3) where the axion ﬁeld θ(x) = 2bµxµ = 2b · r − 2b0t and
bµ = b0, bi are parameters that break the parity (b0) and time-reversal (bi). The current can be computed from the
eﬀective action and is found to be

The ﬁrst equation above describes the anomalous Hall eﬀect, with the Hall conductance proportional to the separation
between the Weyl nodes

σxy = e2/h × |b| .

(10)

The second equation describes the chiral magnetic eﬀect, which naively seems to imply equilibrium currents in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld[18, 19]. But the notion of the chiral anomaly in a condensed matter system is itself
somewhat idealised, because unlike in the relativistic case where chiral symmetric is exact for massless fermions, here,
even the relativistic dispersion for the Weyl fermions and chiral symmetry is only approximately true, close to the
Weyl nodes. Hence, using the chiral anomaly directly to predict eﬀects in the Weyl semi-metal is not a very good
idea. More detailed calculations have shown that the ﬁrst result can be rederived in diﬀerent ways[20], but the second
result involving the naive expectation of equilibrium currents is incorrect in the condensed matter context[21]. As
pointed out in Ref.22, in a Weyl semi-metal, although there is a charge imbalance at the nodes due to the anomaly,
there is also a return path for the charges via the Fermi arcs on the surfaces. Hence, one needs to be careful in
applying relativistic ideas directly to the Weyl semi-metal system.

So the basic idea to look for eﬀects of the anomaly, would be to apply parallel electric and magnetic ﬁelds to the
system and see whether there are explicit eﬀects due to the charge imbalance between the two chiral nodes in the
condensed matter system itself. One would expect the results to be highly anisotropic, because the eﬀect depends
on the angle between the applied electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld, being maximum when E (cid:107) B and minimum
(vanishing) when E ⊥ B. In fact, there have been several works [23, 24] which have explicitly computed the physical
eﬀects of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semi-metals. They have shown that the chiral anomaly actually leads to large
negative longitudinal magneto-resistance at weak ﬁelds, as expected from the anomaly equation. More recently, there
has been work[25] which has shown that the chiral anomaly generically leads to longitudinal magneto-resistance (LMR)
in three dimensional chiral metals (not necessarily Weyl semi-metals and not necessarily even Dirac materials). In a
Weyl semi-metal, the sign of the LMR depends on the kind impurities in the sample, and generically, with both ionic
and neutral impurities, the LMR becomes negative initially and then becomes positive as a function of the magnetic
ﬁeld.

Other eﬀects of the anomaly such as current induced by strain ﬁelds[19], anisotropic non-local voltage drops[26]
and optical absorption[27] due to the charge imbalance between the two nodes have also been studied. For inversion
symmetry breaking semi-metals, the chiral nodes are at two diﬀerent energies, which leads to a chiral chemical
potential between the nodes. This can give rise to measurable optical signals[28]. Other eﬀects include unusual
plasmon modes[29] in doped WSM. All these possibilities have spurred experimental activity in this ﬁeld and in the
last few months, there has been deﬁnite evidence for Weyl fermions in several materials.

IV. CURRENT EXCITEMENT DUE TO ‘DISCOVERY’ OF WEYL FERMIONS

The initial proposals for Weyl semi-metals included pyrochlore iridates[7], HgCr2Se4[13] and topological insulator-
normal insulator heterostructures[12], but there is no experimental evidence for them yet. Negative magnetoresistance
was observed experimentally[30] when magnetic ﬁeld was applied to BiSb tuned to its critical point (the Dirac point)
between normal and topological insulator, but that by itself was not convincing enough to conﬁrm the existence
of Weyl fermions, particularly since it was realised that negative magneto-resistance is generic in three dimensional
metals. However, in the last few months, there has been a lot of excitement[31] in the ﬁeld, ever since the publication
of direct evidence for not only the Weyl nodes, but also the Fermi arcs in the non-centrosymmetric material T aAs
using ARPES (angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy) techniques, by the Princeton group[32] and a group from
the Chinese Academy of Sciences[33]. They were able to show co-propagating Fermi arcs terminating at the Weyl
nodes with non-zero chiral charges of ±2. At the same time, Weyl nodes were also seen in a photonic crystal,
which was ‘made to order’ to reproduce a desired band structure[34]. Both these cases involved inversion symmetry
breaking.
In T aAs, the crystal structure itself lacked inversion symmetry and in the photonic crystal, inversion
symmetry breaking was explicitly incorporated. The photonic crystal was made such that it realises 4 Weyl nodes
(the minimum for inversion symmetry breaking Weyl semi-metals), whereas T aAs has 24 Weyl nodes. Fermi arcs have
also been observed in Dirac semi-metals, such as Cd3As2[35] and N a3Bi[36]. Other candidate materials include an
inversion symmetry breaking stochiometric compound SrSi2[37] which forms a WSM without spin-orbit coupling and
an exotic state with quadratic dispersion when spin-orbit coupling is included, but this has not yet been conﬁrmed.
For a recent review of topological semi-metals predicted from ﬁrst principle calculations, see [38] .

(WTI) ( = 2t) boundaries (shown by black lines) with broken time reversal (bz)/ parity (b0) perturbations. The WSM phase
extends with increasing perturbations in the ﬁlled regions. Parameters used here are λz = λSO.

V. EXPLICIT LATTICE MODEL AND PHASE DIAGRAM

We will now study some features of the WSM in detail[39], using a simple tight-binding four-band lattice model
[21, 40] for the topological insulator (TI) in three dimensions (3DTI), whose phases can describe strong and weak
topological insulators, Weyl semi-metals and ordinary insulators depending on the values of the various parameters
of the model. Many 3DTI materials, including the family belonging to the Bi2Se3 class, have an eﬀective description
in terms of the Hamiltonian given by H0 = HC + HSO [21] with

obtained using parity invariance[41] and are given by[39]

for i = 1, 2, 3. Depending on the values of the invariants, we have the following phases:

Here b0 and b are parameters that break inversion and TR symmetry respectively and separate the Dirac point of the
TI into two Weyl points, with the separation being in energy and in momentum space respectively[21]. An arbitrary
hermitean term can be added to this Hamiltonian, whose eﬀect will be to cause the Weyl nodes to move around.
However, for small perturbations, it cannot remove the nodes. The nodes can only vanish if the perturbation is large
enough to bring both the Weyl nodes together. The phase diagram of the diﬀerent phases in this model is given in
Fig. 1[39].

The band structure of the WSM is given in Fig. 2[39]. As can be seen from there, the cones which describe the Fermi
surface around each of the nodes are independent for small enough doping (small values of the chemical potential
or Fermi energy EF ). But for larger values of the chemical potential, they merge into a single Fermi surface. For
suﬃciently large system size, the dispersion is ﬂat between the two Weyl nodes along the kx direction, and is linear
along ky (for kx values between the Weyl nodes). These are the surface states (in momentum space) and are shown
in Figs. 2 and 3.

FIG. 2: (Color online) The dispersion for a WSM with 2 Weyl nodes at k0 = ±bx/λz is shown along kx and ky. The parameters

VI. CHARACTERISTICS OF SURFACE STATES AND FERMI ARCS

The existence of surface states for the TI is well-established. They are isolated from the bulk states, since the bulk is
gapped, and they are spin-momentum locked - i.e., the spin is tied to the direction of motion, and opposite spins travel
in opposite directions. This has been explicitly seen in many experiments[42] using scanning tunneling microscopy.
Surface states also exist for the WSM. This is more unexpected because one does not expect well-separated surface
states in a gapless model, since they are expected to merge with the bulk states. So the ﬁrst question that one has
to answer is why surface states exist at all. It is because the system (to a good approximation) is translationally
invariant. Hence, momentum is a good quantum number and it is possible to have surface states at momenta where
there are no bulk states - ie., between the Weyl nodes.

It is also found that the surface states at the Fermi energy in WSM form an arc and not a full Fermi surface. These
Fermi arcs end at the projection of the Weyl nodes onto the surface, where the surface mode is no longer well-deﬁned,
because it merges into the bulk modes. What does this mean? An intuitive picture [14] to understand Fermi arcs is
to start with a very thin sample of Weyl semi-metal and slowly increase the thickness so that the two surfaces are
pulled apart. To start with, we have a complete Fermi surface, but as the thickness increases, complementary parts
of the Fermi surface get attached to the two surfaces and they get connected to one another through the Weyl nodes
in the bulk. A picture of how the surface states at the two opposite surfaces with opposite chiralities get connected
through the bulk states is given in Fig. 3. This is essentially the same dispersion that is shown in Fig. 2 separately
along the kx axis and ky axis.

FIG. 4: (Color online) The Berry phase monopoles of charge ±1 at the two Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. The two
dimensional planes within the nodes are quantum Hall planes with non-zero Berry ﬂux passing through it and hence non-zero
Chern number. The Fermi arcs are the edge states of the quantum Hall planes strung together.

FIG. 5: (Color online) The local (surface) density of states (LDOS) for a WSM with 2 Weyl nodes at ±k0. The red line shows
ﬁnite value for LDOS, whereas the yellow region denotes zero LDOS. Note that surface states appear on the x-y and x-z planes,
but not along the y-z planes.

+-C=1C=0C=08

We now study the surface states for both the TI and WSM phases in the speciﬁc four band (ﬁnite-size) model
that we have studied in the previous section where TR is broken. For strong topological insulators, surface states
exist on each surface as mid-gap states[5] in the band structure, whereas in weak topological insulators, surface states
arise only on particular surfaces depending on the values of νi (i = 1, 2, 3)[43]. For Weyl semi-metals, in our model,
inversion symmetry breaking does not give rise to surface states. Surface states arise only when TR is broken at the
phase boundary between the normal and the topological insulator. For instance, if we choose the TR symmetry to
be broken by b = bx ˆx, then each Dirac point yields a pair of Weyl nodes with a separation of bx/λz ˆx in momentum
space, and we note that away from the Weyl nodes, there is a gap in the spectrum. If we put the chemical potential
at the energy of the Weyl nodes, we can consider the state obtained by ﬁlling all the negative energy states. By
studying how this state evolves as a function of the crystal momentum, we deﬁne the Berry phase and the Berry ﬂux
B(k) = ∇k × A(k). The Weyl nodes here are the sources of this ﬂux ∇B(k) = ±δ3(k − k±).

Since the Weyl nodes can be thought of as sources and sinks of Berry phase monopoles, there is a ﬂux penetrating all
the two-dimensional layers between the nodes. All these layers have non-zero Chern number, whereas two-dimensional
planes not between the nodes have zero Chern number. So the two-dimensional planes between the nodes are like
quantum Hall planes and they all exhibit integer quantum Hall eﬀect and have edge states. In other words, for each
value of kx between the Weyl nodes, we have a Chern insulator. This is precisely the reason that there is an anomalous
Hall eﬀect as shown in Eq.10 proportional to the separation between the Weyl nodes. The Fermi arc is just the line
that one gets by stringing the edge states of the Chern insulator together and clearly these states only exist between
the Weyl nodes. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 . It also clear from the ﬁgure that surface states can only exist on the
x-y and x-z planes. No surface states exist on the y-z planes since the separation between the Weyl nodes is along
the x-axis.

Now, let us look at the surface states of this model in detail. The ﬁrst surprise is that there are surface states,
because there is no gap. So if we put the chemical potential at the position of the Weyl nodes, there are not only
gapless surface states, but also gapless bulk states at the same chemical potential at the nodes. So we may think that
the surface states should hybridise with the bulk states. But as we mentioned earlier, momentum conservation implies
that it is possible to have surface states at momenta where there are no bulk states - ie., between the Weyl nodes. So
at these values of the momentum, we will only have surface states and no bulk states - the material will appear like
a topological insulator. When we look at the the local density of states of the real position-space surface of the three
dimensional WSM as a function of the momentum, at the Fermi energy (tuned to the Weyl nodes), we ﬁnd that they
form an arc, (in this particular model, it forms a straight line) between the momenta k0 and −k0, the positions of the
Weyl nodes, instead of a closed curve. This is shown in Fig. 5. At the Weyl nodes, there is no distinction between
the surface states and bulk states, and they merge into the bulk. But between the Weyl nodes, the surface states are
well-deﬁned. As discussed above, the surface states are essentially the edge states of the quantum Hall planes strung
together.

There has also been a detailed study[44] of the evolution of the surface states (Fermi arcs) to form a single Dirac
cone as the parameters of a time-reversal (TR) symmetric but inversion symmetry broken WSM are changed to
become a TI.

As we mentioned earlier, the excitement in this ﬁeld has increased many-fold[31] since the actual visualisation of

the Fermi arcs by the Princeton and Chinese Academy of Sciences groups[32, 33] .

VII. NEW PHENOMENA IN WEYL SEMI-METALS

Weyl semi-metals have bulk conducting states and hence, are metallic. However, there are many ways in which
their behaviour is diﬀerent from usual metals. The metallic states exist only for some values of momenta and at other
values of momenta, there is a gap to excitations. The excitations at the nodes are chiral and hence their spin is aligned
to the direction of motion. All of this leads to new transport phenomena which exists only for Weyl semi-metals.
In this section, we will discuss some new results that occur when Weyl semi-metals are placed in proximity with
superconductors.

Motivated by the fact that the introduction of superconductivity via either proximity eﬀect or by introducing a
pairing ∆ term in the bulk leads to a new topological phase in the topological insulator, we studied[39] what happens
when a Weyl semi-metal is tunnel coupled to an s-wave superconductor. We started with the model described in
Sec.(IV) with two Weyl nodes separated by the time-reversal breaking parameter b in the x-direction. We took the
model to be inﬁnite in the y direction so that ky is a good quantum number and we took z to be ﬁnite, so that the
surface states existed at the top and bottom in the z-direction. We coupled one of the surfaces of the WSM to an
s-wave superconductor and then integrated out the superconducting degrees of freedom to obtain an eﬀective action
for the WSM. We then obtained the local density of states (LDOS) and the induced pairing in the WSM using a
Green’s function technique as well as exact diagonalisation. We found that the ﬂat band due to the Fermi arc states

(a) kx and (b) ky where the Weyl nodes lie along kx. The blue (gray) high density lines are the modiﬁed bands in the system
with proximity to the superconductor obtained from the LDOS at z = 0 using a Green’s function technique, while the red
(darker) solid line is the surface band at z = 0 via exact diagonalization. The induced gap vanishes at the Weyl nodes for a
large enough system size, but the surface band splits. Various parameters used for the LDOS are λSO = λz = 0.5t, ∆ = 0.7t,
λS = 0.9t,  = 6t, b = (0.5t, 0, 0) and number of sites in z is 20. We have used ky = 0 for (a) and kx = 0 for (b).

split into two when proximity coupled to the WSM, each carrying half the Chern number of the original surface state,
but it does not gap out fully. The gap remains at the Weyl nodes. This is seen in Fig.6[39], and can be understood as
follows. The s-wave superconducting correlations couples the electrons at one node of a certain chirality to holes at
the other node, but of the same chirality (because the two nodes have opposite chirality, but electrons and holes also
have opposite chirality). Hence, no gap can open up, because a mass term requires fermions of opposite chirality.

We have also studied[45] the reﬂection and Andreev reﬂection (the phenomenon where an electron incident on a
superconductor bounces back as a hole and two electrons (a Cooper pair) goes into the superconductor) that takes
place at the junction between a Weyl semi-metal and a superconductor. A scattering approach[46] showed that the
diﬀerential conductance depended on the angle between the current and the vector connecting the two Weyl points.
For the simplest model of a time-reversal breaking Weyl semimetal with two nodes, we showed that both normal
and Andreev reﬂection change chirality - see Fig.7[45]. We also showed that the existence of a new momentum scale
introduced by the time-reversal leads to the non-vanishing of normal reﬂection, unlike in graphene, where at low
energies close to Fermi energy, the current is purely due to Andreev reﬂection and normal reﬂection vanishes.

We also showed that when the Weyl semi-metal is sandwiched between two superconductors, the Josephson current
shows unexpected oscillations as a function of the time-reversal breaking parameter as shown in Fig.8. For normal
metals, the current is expected to be independent of the length L for short ballistic Josephson junctions. For graphene,
which is a Dirac metal, it was shown that the critical current has diﬀusion-like scaling proportional to 1/L at the
Dirac point, but without any impurity scattering[47]. But for the Weyl semi-metal, apart from the 2π periodicity in
φ (which is the phase diﬀerence between the two superconductors), we also ﬁnd a periodicity in the length L with
period π/k0. This is shown in Fig.8[45]. Moreover, we also ﬁnd the zero-pi transition[48] of the Josephson current
characteristic of superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor junctions, which is perhaps not surprising, since the
WSM that we studied violated time-reversal invariance. Here the Josephson current was computed for the lattice
−1, which was coupled to
model of the WSM studied in Sec.(V) through its Green’s function, g(ω) = [(ω + iδ)I − H0]
two superconductors on either side of it, through an onsite self-energy[39]

FIG. 7: (Color online) Both reﬂection (R) and Andreev reﬂection (AR) in a WSM occur from one chiral node to another. The
chiralities of the nodes are denoted as +ve and −ve, whereas the solid and the dashed lines show dispersions of the fermions
at the two Weyl nodes with positive and negative velocities (= dE/dk). The spins of the bands (denoted by arrows) and the
need to conserve spin accounts for the change of chirality for both normal and Andreev reﬂection.

˜t = 0.25t,  = 6t, λ = λz = t, ∆ = 0.01t, µ = 0.02t and L = 60 sites. For these parameters, the position of Weyl nodes, k0 ≈ bz.

on the sites in contact with the ith superconductor. ∆ denoted the s-wave pair potential in the superconductor. Then
writing the full Green’s function as G(ω) = (g−1(ω) − ΣL(ω) − ΣR(ω))−1, we computed the Josephson current[45].

VIII. FUTURE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

The experimental discovery of Weyl semi-metals may lead to new and unexpected spintronic applications. Weyl
fermions are gapless and hence have high mobility and can travel with very little resistance.They have topological
protection because once a Weyl node is formed, it can only annihilate if there is another Weyl node of opposte chirality

-+(     )(     )11

and they are brought together. They are also chiral and their spin is aligned to the direction of motion.

In the next few years, there is considerable scope in the experimental front for discovering new candidate materials
for Weyl semi-metals, particularly with time-reversal symmetry breaking, which has not yet been seen. On the
theoretical front, massless Weyl fermions had been studied for many years in high energy physics as a possible
candidate of neutrinos, before the mass for neutrinos was discovered. It would be of interest to see whether any of the
more exotic eﬀects like neutrino oscillations have possible manifestations in the condensed matter context. The study
and classiﬁcation of gapless topological materials is also far from complete and will also probably gain centre-stage in
the next few years.

I would like to thank my collaborators Udit Khanna, Arijit Kundu and Dibyakanti Mukherjee for many useful

discussions on many aspects of topological insulators and Weyl semi-metals.
