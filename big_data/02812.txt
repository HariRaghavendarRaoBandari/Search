Abstract: We consider the algebra of simple operators deﬁned in a time band in a
CFT with a holographic dual. When the band is smaller than the light crossing time
of AdS, an entire causal diamond in the center of AdS is separated from the band by
a horizon. We show that this algebra obeys a version of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem:
the action of the algebra on the CFT vacuum can approximate any low energy state
in the CFT arbitrarily well, but no operator within the algebra can exactly annihilate
the vacuum. We show how to relate local excitations in the complement of the central
diamond to simple operators in the band. Local excitations within the diamond are
invisible to the algebra of simple operators in the band by causality, but can be related
to complicated operators called “precursors”. We use the Reeh-Schlieder theorem to
write down a simple and explicit formula for these precursors on the boundary. We
comment on the implications of our results for black hole complementarity and the
emergence of bulk locality from the boundary.

Introduction

Recent discussions of the information paradox [1] have revived interest in the idea of
black hole complementarity [2].
In a colloquial sense, this is the idea that degrees
of freedom inside the black hole are “scrambled” combinations of degrees of freedom
outside. A precise version of this idea was developed in [3]. In this construction, a
local operator inside the black hole can be represented as a suﬃciently complicated
combination of O (SBH) operators outside the black hole, where SBH is the black hole
entropy. This is indicated by

φ(xin) ∼= P (φ(x2), φ(x3), . . .),

(1.1)

where φ(xin) is a local ﬁeld located inside the black hole and P is a suitably complicated
polynomial comprised entirely of ﬁelds localized at points xout ≡ {x2, x3, . . .} outside
the black hole that are spacelike to xin. (See ﬁgure 1.)

It is apparent that such a relation implies a radical loss of causality and locality
in correlators with O (SBH) insertions. However, the analysis of [3] left two questions
unanswered. First, what is the precise form of P that we must pick in order to observe
this loss of locality, and in what sense is the ﬁeld inside equal to the polynomial?
Second, while positing such a loss of locality resolves various aspects of the information
paradox, what is the independent evidence that this is indeed a physical feature of
quantum gravity?

The objective of this paper is to investigate these questions in a simpler setting. We
describe, in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence [4], how such a loss of locality

xout.

is not only physical but can even be seen in empty AdS in the absence of black holes.
In particular, given a local ﬁeld operator φ(x1), we will explicitly ﬁnd “complicated”
polynomials, P made up of ﬁeld operators with support on points that are all spacelike
= P. In this equation the symbol

with respect to x1, but with the property that φ(x1)

= means that we can approximate φ(x1) as accurately as we wish, but true equality
can only be obtained by taking the limit of an inﬁnite sequence of polynomials. This
makes (1.1) precise and thus demonstrates non-locality in a calculable setting.

Our setup in this paper is as follows. We consider a large N CFT with a bulk
AdS dual. In this CFT, we consider the set of boundary operators deﬁned in a short
time band. Now, if this time band is shorter than the light-crossing time of AdS, it
naturally divides the bulk spacetime into two regions: a causal diamond near the center
of AdS that is causally disconnected from the time band, and its complement. (See
ﬁgure 2.)

We argue that the CFT dual of this division is that operators in the CFT can
be naturally divided into two classes: simple operators —which consist of single trace
operators and polynomials of an O (1) number of single trace operators — and complex
operators, where the number of single-trace components starts scaling as a function of
N . While the region of AdS near the boundary is reconstructed by simple operators,
we argue that the region near the center of AdS is reconstructed by complicated ones.
The two sets approximately commute in the large N limit and on a given class of
states. However, their commutator is not zero as an operator equation, and in fact,
complicated operators can in principle be reconstructed by many simple operators.

– 2 –

To demonstrate this feature, we identify the speciﬁc complicated operators that
probe the diamond at the center of AdS. It turns out that the key ingredient we need
for these operators are the polynomials

pc(cid:88)

p=0

Pα,pc =

(−1)p (αH)p

p!

,

(1.2)

speciﬁed by two adjustable cutoﬀs, α, pc that we can choose freely, provided we take
them to be large enough. For example, as we describe below, one suﬃciently large
choice is α = ln(N ) and pc = N ln(N ). Here H is the CFT Hamiltonian, shifted
appropriately so that the ground state has energy 0. Note that

pc→∞Pα,pc = P0,

lim
α→∞ lim

where P0 = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| is the projector onto the CFT vacuum. We show that combining these
complicated polynomials with other simple polynomials of single-trace operators allows
us to probe regions which, in the bulk, are causally disconnected from the time band.
These observations demonstrate several important physical points: in order to un-
derstand locality in AdS/CFT, we have to distinguish between simple and complicated
experiments. Since eﬀective ﬁeld theory only requires locality to hold for simple experi-
ments, we can indeed have signiﬁcant violations of locality once we consider complicated
operators in the theory.

A second important point is the relation between radial depth, complexity and
time-dependence. The fact that we have locality in the emergent radial direction in
AdS/CFT is related to the fact that at any given moment in time, the information of
the quantum state of the CFT is partly contained in simple and partly in complicated
operators. It is hard for a boundary observer to extract the information in the compli-
cated operators, which is geometrically related to the fact that she does not have direct
access to points deep in AdS. Under time evolution the dynamics of the CFT shuﬄes
the information between simple and complex operators. For states near the vacuum of
AdS, the shuﬄing time is of the order of the AdS light crossing time.

Hence complicated operators inside a short time band can become simple operators
at later points outside the band. On the other hand, if the state corresponds to a black
hole in the bulk, then the information gets trapped in complicated operators for a very
long time, until it manages to escape via Hawking evaporation.

It is remarkable that the study of CFT operators in the short-time band can also
capture some of the essential physics of black hole complementarity. We believe that
this model deserves further attention.

– 3 –

Before we close this section, we would like to mention that the same setup of a
spherical hole in AdS was ﬁrst considered in [5]. (See [6] for related work.) There it
was proposed that the decomposition of the bulk into D and D could be understood
in the CFT by covering the time band B with a set of overlapping causal diamonds,
whose size was determined by that of B, and considering the information that could
be recovered by localized measurements in these diamonds. The proposal in this paper
diﬀers in that it concentrates on the decomposition of the boundary algebra into simple
and complicated operators.

Second, this work has overlap with questions discussed in [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The “code
subspace” introduced in [10] is similar to the subspace created by acting with the small
algebra on the ground state of the CFT. As noted there, this construction was, in
turn, related to a similar subspace—termed HΨ, and obtained by acting with the small
algebra on an equilibrium black hole state — that played a role in the reconstruction of
the black hole interior [12, 3]. However, we do not consider the question of the spatial
localization of the information in the CFT and the possible connection to quantum
error correction that was a central part of the discussion in [10].

There is also signiﬁcant discussion in the literature on reconstructing the bulk from
a subregion on the boundary that does have a causal complement. It was proposed
in [13] that this region is dual to bulk region called the “entanglement wedge”, and
we refer the reader to [14] for some recent work on this proposal. The Reeh-Schlieder
theorem has also been previously considered in the context of AdS/CFT in the paper
[15] that considered the algebra of operators on the boundary of bulk wedges.

Our emphasis in this paper is somewhat diﬀerent from the papers above because
we are considering an entire band on the boundary. The “entanglement wedge” dual
to this contains an entire Cauchy slice for the bulk. The reason we nevertheless are
able to deﬁne a consistent subalgebra on the boundary is because of our division of
boundary operators into simple and complicated operators.

This paper is organized as follows.

In section 2 we describe our setup in more
detail. In section 3 we describe the division of this algebra into simple and complicated
operators in a more precise manner. We also prove a version of the Reeh-Schlieder
theorem for operators conﬁned to a ﬁnite band in time. In section 4, we describe how
operators near the center of AdS that are causally disconnected from the time band,
can nevertheless be constructed in terms of operators in the time band using suitably
complicated operators. Some additional implications are discussed in section 5.

2 The setup
We consider a large N CFT with a holographic dual, deﬁned on Sd−1× [time]. We take
the CFT in the ground state |0(cid:105). The dual spacetime is AdSd+1 in global coordinates

ds2 = −(cid:0)1 + r2(cid:1) dt2 +

dr2
1 + r2 + r2dΩ2

d−1

We are working in units where both the radius of Sd−1 and of AdSd+1 are set to 1.

Figure 2. The time band B of length T < π on the boundary of AdS spacetime, the diamond
shaped region D in the bulk and its causal complement, the annular region D.

We consider a time band B in the CFT that is deﬁned to be the set of points
Sd−1 × [0, T ]. We are interested in the case where this band is short, and in particular
shorter than the light crossing time in AdS: T < π.

The bulk points that are causally disconnected from boundary points in B consti-
tute a causal diamond D in the center of AdS as depicted in ﬁgure 2. The base of the
diamond extends in the r coordinate up to

(cid:20)π − T

(cid:21)

rd = tan

2

As we make the length T of the band longer, the diamond gets smaller in size and for
T ≥ π the diamond disappears altogether. The causal complement of the diamond
deﬁnes an annular domain in the bulk that is denoted as D in ﬁgure 2.

– 5 –

hIf we were dealing with a non-gravitational QFT on a ﬁxed AdS background then
the two domains D,D would correspond to a decomposition of the bulk Hilbert space
in two factors. Here, we are neglecting UV divergences, and so the situation would be
similar to the decomposition of the Minkowski Hilbert space into two Rindler wedges.
More precisely the operator algebras A(D) and A(D) would be well deﬁned and in-
dependent. In a theory with gravity we do not expect to have sharply deﬁned local
observables, so these algebras will make sense only in an approximate sense, in the
large N limit. Our goal in this paper is precisely to explore this loss of locality.

In some sense the set-up resembles a black hole. For the observer conﬁned to the
time band, there is a spherical horizon located at r = rd. Approximately local degrees
of freedom at smaller values of r are not easily accessible to this observer. However,
as we show below, just as in the case of black hole complementarity, this observer can
access the interior of D, using suﬃciently complicated operators.

While we will elaborate on this answer shortly, we ﬁrst point out how local operators
in A(D) can be related to simple operators inside the time band B on the boundary.
Consider a free scalar ﬁeld φ in D, satisfying ((cid:3) − m2) φ = 0. We impose nor-
malizable boundary conditions for this ﬁeld in the time band, and additionally impose
the boundary condition that a suitably rescaled ﬁeld tends to the boundary operator
within the time band. This corresponds to

lim
and ﬁxes the form of φ within D.

More precisely, we can write the bulk ﬁeld within D as

r→∞ r∆φ(t, r, Ω) = O(t, Ω),
(cid:88)

φ(t, r, Ω) =

OT
k,(cid:96)e−i2πkt/T ζk,(cid:96)(r)Y(cid:96)(Ω) + h.c,

These modes OT
k,(cid:96) should not be confused with the global AdS modes On,(cid:96) that appear
later and are deﬁned in (3.10). Another technicality, which is irrelevant here, is that
since we have deﬁned these modes by convoluting the boundary operators with a func-
tion that drops sharply to 0 at the end-points 0 and T , the action of OT
k,(cid:96) creates states
that have high energy tails and are non-normalizable.

While (2.2) gives an explicit formula for the bulk to boundary map in momentum
space, it is not possible to Fourier transform this expression back to position space as
a result of the exponential growth in the mode function at large (cid:96). This means we
cannot write the bulk ﬁeld in terms of a convolution of the boundary operator with an
ordinary function in position space on the boundary.

This can also be related to the existence of bulk null geodesics that do not intersect the
time band B [16]. The same technical complication arises in the reconstruction of the
AdS-Rindler wedge and of the exterior of an AdS black hole. As was ﬁrst explained
in [12] and then elaborated in [15], we must understand KT as a distribution that is
integrated only against correlators in the CFT. Leaving aside this subtlety, the bottom
line is that we expect local operators in D to be related to simple CFT operators in
the time band.

Note that no such direct construction is possible for operators inside the diamond
D within eﬀective ﬁeld theory. Except for Gauss law tails, which appear because the
energy and other conserved charges can all be measured at inﬁnity, local operators inside
D commute with simple single-trace operators within the time band on the boundary.
One may wonder why it would not be possible to simply apply (2.2) for points
inside D. While the hypergeometric function in (2.2) is well deﬁned everywhere except
for r = 0, the ﬁeld that we would obtain by means of this formal extension would not
obey (2.1) for t > T . So, it would diﬀer from the correct bulk ﬁeld operator inside
D. The extension of the ﬁeld from D to D is not uniquely determined by boundary
conditions on B, since we can have solutions with support in D that are zero everywhere
on B; so if we restrict ourselves to single-trace operators, we need information from the
boundary region [T, π] to construct the ﬁeld in D.

– 7 –

In section 4, we will write down an explicit formula for operators inside D, but this

requires us to go beyond the single-trace sector considered above.

3 Operator algebras in time bands
In this section, we will analyze the algebra of operators A(B) more closely. We show
that when this algebra is appropriately deﬁned, then we can prove a version of the
Reeh-Schlieder theorem.
In this context, the theorem states that all eﬀective ﬁeld
theory excitations in AdS, including those in D and those in D can be obtained by
acting with operators within B.

In formula (2.2) we have already related individual ﬁeld operators to smeared single-
trace operators. Now, in ordinary QFT, we can multiply ﬁeld operators to obtain other
ﬁeld operators. This gives rise to an algebra of local operators. We can do the same by
multiplying single-trace operators on the boundary smeared with functions that have
support only inside the time band.

Before we proceed, we pause to emphasize an important point. In a general QFT,
there is no sense in which we can associate an algebra of operators with a time band.
The set of all operators at a given time constitutes all operators in the theory. This is
evident in any Hamiltonian formulation of the theory, and is formalized by the time-slice
axiom [17].

The reason that we can deﬁne an algebra corresponding to a time band for CFTs
with a holographic dual is because they have a special class of operators called gener-
alized free ﬁelds [18]. These are local operators with a small operator dimension with
the property that their correlators factorize. We will denote such a ﬁeld by O(t, Ω).
We would like to consider all kinds of ﬁelds, including tensor ﬁelds, but for simplicity
we omit the tensor indices. We also assume that O(t, Ω) is Hermitian. The condition
of factorization means that
(cid:104)0|O(t1, Ω1) . . .O(t2n, Ω2n)|0(cid:105) =

(cid:104)0|O(tπ1, Ωπ1)O(tπ2, Ωπ2)|0(cid:105) . . .

)|0(cid:105) + O

where the sum is over all permutations of (1 . . . 2n). These operators are called general-
ized free ﬁelds because while they share the property of factorization with perturbative
free ﬁelds, they do not obey a perturbative equation of motion.

In a large N gauge theory, generalized free ﬁelds are low dimension single trace
conformal primary operators. For example, in N=4 Super Yang Mills theory, the
operators Tr(F 2) and the stress tensor, T µν are both generalized free ﬁelds.

– 8 –

We now deﬁne simple operators to be those that can be written as low-order poly-
nomials in generalized free ﬁelds. Complicated operators are those that can only be
expressed as polynomials of a very high order — this includes large multi-trace oper-
ators of dimension O (N ) and also operators that change the Hamiltonian by a small
amount, or not at all, such as P0.

It is convenient to deﬁne the modes of generalized free ﬁelds on the sphere through

(cid:90)

Sd−1

O(cid:96)(t) =

dd−1ΩO(t, Ω)Y ∗

(cid:96) (Ω),

where Y(cid:96)(Ω) are the spherical harmonics on Sd−1.

We now consider the set of all polynomials in these modes
Asmall(B) = span of{O(cid:96)1(t1),O(cid:96)2(t2)O(cid:96)3(t3), . . . ,O(cid:96)4(t4)O(cid:96)5(t5)···O(cid:96)Dm (tDm)}.
(3.1)
We write an element of this “small algebra” as Aa ∈ Asmall, where the time argument
of the operators on the RHS must be localized in B.

Several comments are in order. First, we introduce a cut-oﬀ in the number of
operators in the product by demanding that the degree of each polynomial should not
be larger than Dm. We must ensure that

Dm (cid:28) N.

Hence the set Asmall(B) is an algebra in a restricted sense, since arbitrary multiplications
can take us outside the set. We also limit the highest allowed angular momentum mode
that can enter the algebra, (cid:96) ≤ (cid:96)max (cid:28) N .

These cutoﬀs are important for realizing the idea of complementarity: while for
simple operators, which are dual to eﬀective ﬁeld theory experiments in the bulk, the
cutoﬀ in the deﬁnition of Asmall(B) is not important, at a fundamental level the set
Asmall(B) is not a closed sub-algebra of the CFT. We will continue calling this set an
“algebra”, but the reader should keep this important limitation in mind.

We now establish some key properties of this small algebra with respect to the
vacuum. First, consider the Hilbert space HEFT of all states in EFT that can be
thought of as AdS with a small number of excitations. This is produced by acting with
polynomials of generalized free ﬁelds, both inside and outside the band.
HEFT = span of{O(cid:96)1(t1)|0(cid:105),O(cid:96)2(t2)O(cid:96)3(t3)|0(cid:105), . . . ,O(cid:96)4(t4)O(cid:96)5(t5)···O(cid:96)Dm (tDm)|0(cid:105)}.

The diﬀerence between (3.1) and the expressions above is that the time coordinates
now are not limited to the time band and we have 0 ≤ ti ≤ π.

– 9 –

We will now prove an analogue of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem [17] for local algebras

for the small algebra deﬁned above.

HEFT

= Asmall|0(cid:105),
.

(3.2)
i.e. the set of states obtained by acting with the small algebra Asmall is dense in the full
Hilbert space of eﬀective ﬁeld theory. This is the statement that the the CFT ground
state |0(cid:105) is a cyclic vector for this Hilbert space with respect to the small algebra.

In the bulk, the property (3.2) can be thought of as the version of Reeh-Schlieder
theorem for region D. On the boundary this is a version of Reeh-Schlieder for ﬁnite
time-domains. As explained above, this statement is non-trivial only in a situation
where we can naturally deﬁne the notion of a small algebra in a time domain, for
instance in large N CFTs.

We ﬁrst establish this result in the large N limit, N → ∞, namely the free ﬁeld
limit when there is no interaction. These results can easily be generalized away from
the free-ﬁeld limit, within perturbation theory in 1

Let us consider smearing O(cid:96)(t) in time by a smearing function f whose support is

N as we indicate subsequently.

conﬁned inside the time band. This deﬁnes operators Xf as

Xf =

dtf (t)O(cid:96)(t)

f (t) = 0 for t /∈ [0, T ].

,

(3.3)

These operators can be thought of as generators of the small algebra Asmall(B) of simple
operators in the time band. We do not display the dependence of X on the angular
momentum quantum number (cid:96) because it will not play much of a role below.

In the large N limit, the space of simple bulk states has the structure of a Fock
space. As a consequence of this, the statement (3.2) can be established by simply
showing that any single particle state can be well approximated by a state of the form
Xf|0(cid:105). More precisely, any single particle state can be written as

(cid:90)

|Ψ(cid:105) =

dt g(t)O(cid:96)(t)|0(cid:105),

(3.4)

(cid:90) π

0

(cid:90) T

(cid:90) π

for an appropriate choice of the function g(t). Then the claim is that we can ﬁnd a
sequence of functions f1, . . . fn, . . ., such that

lim

O(cid:96)(t)fn(t)|0(cid:105) =

g(t)O(cid:96)(t)|0(cid:105).

(3.5)

To prove this, we consider its converse. If (3.5) did not hold, then there would exist
a non-vanishing state of the form (3.4) orthogonal to all states produced by operators

– 10 –

of the form (3.3). This in particular would require that (cid:104)0|O(cid:96)(t)|Ψ(cid:105) = 0 for all t ∈ [0, T ]
and for all (cid:96). We consider the function

R(t) ≡ (cid:104)0|O(cid:96)(t)|Ψ(cid:105).

Given the positivity of the energies in the CFT this function can be analytically con-
tinued in the Im[t] < 0 half-plane. We then have a meromorphic function R(t) in the
lower half plane with the property that limIm[t]→0− R(t) = 0 for all Re[t] ∈ [0, T ]. Then
the “edge of the wedge” theorem implies that R(t) vanishes everywhere. This is incon-
sistent with the assumption that |Ψ(cid:105) was a non-vanishing state of the form (3.4), we
have thus reached a contradiction.

Having thus established that general bulk single-particle states of the form (3.4)
can be arbitrarily well approximated by states produced by operators of the form (3.3),
it is easy to show that in the large N limit the same can be done for multi-particle bulk
states by induction. Say that we have proved that all n-particle states can be obtained
by acting with operators inside B. Then the space of (n + 1)-particle states is spanned
by states of the form

(3.6)
where |Ψn(cid:105) is a n particle state and g(t) is arbitrary as above. Once again, it is possible
to construct this using

0

|Ψn+1(cid:105) =

O(cid:96)(t)g(t)|Ψn(cid:105),

(cid:90) π

|Ψn+1(cid:105) = lim

n→∞ Xfn|Ψn(cid:105),

for an appropriately chosen sequence of functions fn with support in [0, T ]. If this has
not been possible we would have (cid:104)Ψn|O(cid:96)(t)|Ψn+1(cid:105) = 0 for all t ∈ [0, T ]. By the edge of
the wedge theorem, this would require (cid:104)Ψn|O(cid:96)(t)|Ψn+1(cid:105) = 0,∀t ∈ [0, π], but this is in
contradiction with (3.6).

This property of cyclicity is a somewhat surprising property, and we can gain
intuition for it by examining the structure of the norm on the space of single-particle
states. Indeed, it is clear that a general function in [0, π] cannot be well-approximated
by a function in [0, T ] in the usual L2 norm. What allows us to approximate a state
produced by a function on [0, π] with another state produced by functions on [0, T ] is
the structure of the norm.

Therefore the inner-product on the Hilbert space induces a bilocal product on function
space that depends on the Wightman function in the ground state

(cid:104)0|O(cid:96)(t1)O(cid:96)(cid:48)(t2)|0(cid:105) ≡ G(cid:96)(t1 − t2)δ(cid:96)(cid:96)(cid:48),

where the delta function in the angular momentum comes from the rotational invariance
of the vacuum. Note that in the correlator above, we have picked an ordering in the
Lorentzian theory. This is a Wightman function, and not a time-ordered correlator.

For any given mode, it is straightforward to compute this Wightman function

explicitly. For example for the modes of a scalar ﬁeld of dimension ∆, we have

From this we learn that on general grounds G(cid:96)(ω) ≥ 0. Moreover at large N the
function G(cid:96)(ω) has support only on single-particle states in the bulk whose energies are
E = ∆ + 2n + (cid:96), where (cid:96) is the angular momentum of the mode.

.

The important property to notice above is that Gn,(cid:96) = 0,∀n < 0. So, to reconstruct
a state of the form (3.4), using (3.5), we need the sequence of functions fn to match
only the positive Fourier components of g and not to match the function in general.
This is what allows us to create any state by acting within the time band and allows
(3.2) to hold.

Although we have phrased our entire discussion within free-ﬁeld theory, most of
the discussion above remains unchanged in its essentials when 1
N corrections are added.
This is because within perturbation theory, we can write the Heisenberg operators
in the 1
N expansion as linear combinations of the free-ﬁeld operators. Note that this
statement is only correct perturbatively, and in terms of the action of these operators on
states with energies much less than N . Therefore, it is clear that, in the perturbative
approximation, the span of these operators is the same as the span of the original
operators. So, we conclude vacuum remains a cyclic vector with respect to Asmall.

We will write the fact that we generate the state |Ψ(cid:105) by acting with an operator

with compact support as

Xf|0(cid:105) .

= |Ψ(cid:105),

where it is understood that this corresponds to taking a sequence of functions in [0, T ]
and then taking the limit.

The reason we are careful to write

.
= instead of = is that, in fact, one can show that
while by acting within [0, T ] it is possible to approximate the state |Ψ(cid:105) arbitrarily well,
one cannot always go to the limit and obtain a state that is equal to |Ψ(cid:105). A closely
related result is that we cannot exactly annihilate the vacuum by acting with operators
smeared with functions in [0, T ].

More precisely, we have the result

(cid:64)f (t), f (cid:54)= 0,

such that

(cid:90) T

f (t)O(cid:96)(t)|0(cid:105) = 0.

The theorem (3.8) is sometimes framed by stating that the vacuum is a separating vector
for the small algebra. We provide two pieces of caution the reader while interpreting
(3.8). First, while we cannot exactly annihilate a state from within the time band, we
can get arbitrarily close to 0; Second, we note that (3.8) only holds for generalized free
ﬁelds that do not correspond to short representations of the conformal algebra. If we
are considering generalized free ﬁelds like the stress tensor or conserved currents, then
it is possible to annihilate the vacuum, as we show below.

We now prove (3.8). Say that a function f (t) with compact support in [0, T ] existed

so that we could use it to annihilate the vacuum. Then we must have

Xf|0(cid:105) =

f (t)O(cid:96)(t)|0(cid:105) =

f (t)O(cid:96)(t)|0(cid:105) = π

Now, unless O belongs to a short representations of the conformal algebra, then by
the state operator map the action of O0,0 on the vacuum creates the primary state
of this representation while On,(cid:96)|0(cid:105) with non-positive n corresponds to descendants.
Since these descendants are orthogonal, we see that for (3.9) to hold, we must have
fn = 0,∀n ≥ 0. But then f is an analytic function in the lower t plane, and since
f (t) = 0 for t ∈ [T, π], by the edge of the wedge theorem, we see that f (t) = 0,∀t. This
proves (3.8).

This proof evidently fails for operators corresponding to short representations.
Here, we can annihilate the vacuum by integrating the operator with a speciﬁc spher-
ical harmonic and then smearing it appropriately in time so as to extract the null
descendant. For example we clearly have

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

dd−1Ω

dt T 00(t, Ω)f(cid:48)(t)|0(cid:105) = 0,

where T is the stress-tensor, and f is a function that vanishes smoothly at the end-
points [0, T ]. Similar relations hold for other conserved currents.

As mentioned above, a related statement is that there exist states |Ψ(cid:105) ∈ HEFT that
can be arbitrarily well approximated but not necessarily quite attained using the opera-
tors Xf . More speciﬁcally, there are states |Ψ(cid:105) ∈ HEFT with the property that while we
0 O(cid:96)(t)fn(t)|0(cid:105) = |Ψ(cid:105)

can ﬁnd a sequence of functions f1, . . . fn, . . ., such that limn→∞(cid:82) T

(cid:90) T

we also have

(cid:64)f (t), such that

f (t)O(cid:96)(t)|0(cid:105) = |Ψ(cid:105).

(3.11)
For example, consider a state |Ψ(cid:105) that is a superposition of global AdS modes with a
maximum nmax. For such a |Ψ(cid:105), we can prove (3.11) just as we proved (3.8). If such
an f existed, then eit(∆+(cid:96)+2nmax)f (t) would lead to a function that was analytic in the
lower t-plane. But any such function that vanishes in [T, π], must vanish everywhere,
and so f would be have to be 0. This is absurd, and so f cannot exist.

The relations (3.8) and (3.11) may be understood as one important diﬀerence
between the algebra of operators in [0, T ] and in [0, π] at inﬁnite N . In the former case,
we cannot produce exact energy eigenstates or annihilate the vacuum exactly, whereas
in the latter we can.

Note that both (3.8) and (3.11) continue to be true at ﬁnite N . This is because we

may write the action of an operator on the vacuum at ﬁnite N as

Aa|0(cid:105) = A0

a|0(cid:105) +

a|1(cid:105) + . . . ,
A1

1
N

a|0(cid:105) is the state that we would have obtained at inﬁnite N, and the remaining
where A0
terms are perturbative corrections. Now, we see that since all the terms multiplying

– 14 –

N are manifestly independent of N , Aa|0(cid:105) = 0 ⇒ A0

a|0(cid:105) = 0. Since
the powers of 1
we have proved that the latter cannot happen, we conclude that perturbatively the
vacuum remains a separating vector. Similarly, it is not possible to generate an exact
energy eigenstate through the action of the small algebra.

However, at ﬁnite ﬁnite N , the relations (3.8) and (3.11) are less of a distinguishing
factor between Asmall and the algebra of single trace operators in the interval [0, π] since
at ﬁnite N we cannot annihilate the vacuum, or produce exact energy eigenstates even
by considering simple operators from the larger time-range.

3.1 Explicit Construction of Arbitrary States Using Operators in the Band

We now turn to the explicit construction of a sequence of functions fn that, through
the operators in (3.3), can approximate any state |Ψ(cid:105) in the larger time band. Let bk(t)
be a complete basis of functions with compact support in [0, T ], where k = 0, 1, . . .∞.
Then we consider the set of trial states

Xfn|0(cid:105) =

αk

O(cid:96)(t)bk(t)dt|0(cid:105),

(3.12)

and choose αk to minimize

k=0

rn = ||Xfn|0(cid:105) − |Ψ(cid:105)||2

for each n. Note that as n increases the value of this minimum must decreases mono-
tonically, since at each n, we have the choice of obtaining the previous minimum by
just taking αn = 0. By the theorem of cyclicity above, we also see also that as we take
n → ∞ this norm must tend to 0.

The same procedure can easily be used to create multi-particle states with operators

that have support only within the time band.

Interior operators and precursors

We now move on to the question of how to represent CFT bulk operators, which are
inside the diamond D, using operators in the time band. From bulk eﬀective ﬁeld
theory, this might seem impossible. Bulk locality implies that CFT operators in the
time band should commute, up to Gauss law tails, with operators in the diamond, since
they are spacelike separated. On the other hand the time slice axiom of quantum ﬁeld
theory implies that all CFT operators are contained in the set of operators at a given
time. Therefore, if the CFT has operators that represent the interior of the diamond,
they must be present in the time band. (This point was also discussed in [10].)

Although this seems to be a contradiction, it is resolved by the fact that bulk
locality is an emergent concept. Operators inside D are made up of complicated op-
erators from the time band. These complicated operators have the property that they
commute with the simple operators that make up operators inside D.

In this section, we will show how to explicitly reconstruct these complicated oper-
ators. Although this construction clearly conﬂicts with bulk locality, we will show that
it can be done in a straightforward manner by adding the complicated polynomials
(1.2), that approximate P0 = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0|, to the algebra.

The operators inside the diamond are also called precursors [19]. This terminology

arises as follows. Consider the excited state,

(cid:20)

(cid:90)

(cid:21)

|exc(cid:105) = exp

i

dΩφ(r = 0, t =

T

, Ω)

|0(cid:105),

Sd−1

which corresponds to the vacuum excited with an S-wave at the center of the diamond.
Then, this state has the property that

(cid:104)exc|Aα|exc(cid:105) = (cid:104)0|Aα|0(cid:105),

∀Aα ∈ Asmall.

(4.1)

– 16 –

This makes it appear that an observer restricted to measuring simple operators inside
the time band cannot detect the presence of this excitation.

On the other hand, an observer who has access to the entire boundary, can simply
wait till the time t = π, and detect the presence of the excitation in |exc(cid:105) in (4.1).
Below, we will directly construct φ(r = 0, t = T
2 , Ω) using complicated operators from
the time band. These operators are called precursors because they give us information
about points deep in the bulk, before this information can causally propagate to the
boundary.

Before we start, it is worth mentioning that there is a simple way to construct
precursors by using operators from only the time band. This is to consider the set of
operators U (t) = eiHt, for all values of t. This fact was also emphasized by Marolf
[8], who argued directly from the bulk that information present in any Cauchy slice
of the boundary could be recovered from any other slice. Note that if we have access
to arbitrarily complicated operators at t = 0, then the Hamiltonian can be evaluated
on that time-slice and we can reconstruct U (t). Using U (t), we can then reconstruct
the Heisenberg operators at all values of time. However, this construction is somewhat
formal, and does not give insight into the nature of the “complicated operators” that
enter into expressions for local operators in the interior of the diamond. It also suggests
that we need an inﬁnite sequence of complicated operators, labelled by diﬀerent values
of t, to reconstruct precursors. This turns out to be unnecessary in the approach that
we follow below.

Our construction proceeds in three steps. First, we remind that reader that it is
possible to write the bulk ﬁeld at any point in AdS, including the center of the diamond
as

φ(t, r, Ω) =

cn,(cid:96)On,(cid:96)e−i(2n+(cid:96)+∆)tY(cid:96)(Ω)χn,(cid:96)(r) + h.c,

This formula follows from the standard analysis of the bulk to boundary smearing
function and we refer the reader to [20] for details and to [12] for a review. Notice that,
unlike the expansion (2.2), the wave functions above do not grow as (cid:96) → ∞ and so we
can write (4.2) in position space as well.

Therefore, if we could reconstruct the operators

using operators from the time band, we would be able to reconstruct the local ﬁeld.

Projector on the Vacuum

We now show that to reconstruct On,(cid:96), we need to add only one operator to the

algebra to obtain precursors. This is the operator
P0 = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0|.

This operator can clearly be constructed using local operators in the CFT within the
time band [0, T ]. For example, we could write

P0 = lim

α→∞ e−αH,

(4.3)

where H is the CFT Hamiltonian that is simply obtained by integrating the local stress
energy tensor

(cid:90)

H =

T 00(t, Ω)dd−1Ω − E0,

and shifted by a constant, E0, to ensure that the ground state is annihilated by H.

But, it is important, that for our purposes we do not need the exact operator (4.3)

but any approximation of the form

Pα,pc =

pc(cid:88)

(−1)p(αH)p

p=0

p!

,

(4.4)

will also suﬃce provided we take α and pc to be large enough.
To see how large these values have to be, note that we must take α large enough so
that, if |Emin(cid:105) is the lowest energy state above the vacuum, we have |Pα,pc|Emin(cid:105)|2 (cid:28) 1.
This requires e−αEmin (cid:28) 1. Now, since every holographic theory contains the graviton,
the ﬁrst excited state has an energy that cannot be larger than d, Emin ≤ d. Second,
consider the highest energy state Emax for states in HEFT. We must keep enough terms
in the polynomial to ensure that (4.4) is a good approximation to the exponential for
this state as well. This implies that that the two conditions on the cutoﬀs are

e−αd (cid:28) 1,

pc (cid:29) αEmax.

(4.5)
We expect that Emax (cid:28) N , since for states with higher energy than this, our
description of the physics in terms of generalized free ﬁelds breaks down. Moreover,
since we are working at leading order in N , it is suﬃcient to suppress the lowest excited
state by a factor of 1
N . Therefore, one choice of cutoﬀs that meets the condition (4.5)
is α = ln(N ) and pc = N ln(N ). The reader may choose to work with diﬀerent cutoﬀs
provided that (4.5) is satisﬁed.

– 18 –

It is important to understand that no choice of cutoﬀs on HEFT will allow us to
include a good approximation to P0 within our simple algebra. For example, let us say
we attempt to take pc = Dm to include an expansion of the form (4.4) in the algebra,
where we remind the reader that Dm is the largest allowed degree of a polynomial in
the simple algebra. But now we see that Emax ≥ dDm, and for states with this energy,
and the cutoﬀ pc = Dm, the expansion (4.4) does not approximate P0 well.
Construction of On,(cid:96)

space. In this limit, we introduce a natural basis of states for HEFT by writing

We now show how to use P0, or alternately the polynomials Pα,pc from (4.4), to

the natural simple harmonic oscillator form

But note that we already know how to construct the states in the Fock space using
operators in the time band. Let us introduce some notation to represent this. We
denote the operator X ∈ Asmall that creates the state (4.6) by

= |pn1,(cid:96)1 . . . pnj ,(cid:96)j . . .(cid:105).

X[pn1,(cid:96)1 . . . pnj ,(cid:96)j . . .]|0(cid:105) .

We can now simply write the ﬁeld operator as

.
We remind the reader that we use
= because the operators in the time band can
reproduce a given state only in the limit shown in (3.5). Except for P0, all the other
operators that appear above explicitly belong to the simple algebra and P0 itself can
be obtained as a limit of a sequence of polynomials Pα,pc.

Note that to obtain this result, we had to use the important result of cyclicity from
the discussion above: the set of states obtained by acting with the small algebra is
dense in the full Hilbert space. Therefore any state obtained by the action of On,(cid:96) on
the vacuum can also be obtained by the action of an appropriate operator from the
time band.

The statement of cyclicity by itself does not allow us to represent the operator On,(cid:96)
in terms of operators from the time band. Rather, it tells us about its action on the
state |0(cid:105). By inserting the projector P0 = |0(cid:105)(cid:104)0| and sandwiching it between a sequence
of operators X[p0,0 . . .] above, we are able to reproduce the entire operators On,(cid:96), and
in turn the local ﬁeld in the interior of the diamond.

We believe that the expression (4.7) gives a remarkably simple expression for pre-

cursors in terms of boundary operators.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have essentially focused on two results. One of them is that large-
scale non-locality is an essential feature of quantum-gravity. Such a loss of causality
is an ingredient in proposals of black-hole complementarity. In previous work, two of
us showed that several recent versions of the information paradox could be resolved by
accepting that simple local operators at a point in the interior of the black hole could
be identiﬁed with complicated operators near the boundary of AdS that were causally
disconnected from that point.

Here, we see that this phenomenon is evident in empty AdS. In particular, our
formula (4.7) shows that one can write the ﬁeld at a point in the center of AdS purely
in terms of a complicated polynomial of operators in a time band T < π, even though
all of these are causally disconnected from the center of the AdS.

A related question has to do with the approximation in which locality arises within
eﬀective ﬁeld theory. Here, we argued that the correct way to understand this is in terms
of an approximate “algebra” of simple operators in the time band. It is possible to deﬁne
such an algebra, only in the large N limit where there is a parametric separation between
light generalized free ﬁelds and more complicated multi-trace operators comprised of
polynomials of N such ﬁelds. We showed that, if one makes a distinction between simple
and complicated operators, then simple operators in a time band of width T < π on
the boundary obey a version of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem. This is the dual of the

– 20 –

Reeh-Schlieder theorem for the region in the bulk that is causally connected to this
time band.

One interesting question, which we hope to explore further has to do with whether
it is possible to deﬁne a natural modular Hamiltonian for the time-band. This can be
done entirely algebraically on the boundary using the techniques of Tomita-Takesaki
theory as follows. We can deﬁne the following anti-linear operator

SAα|0(cid:105) = A†

α|0(cid:105), Aα ∈ Asmall,

which is well deﬁned on HEFT because the vacuum is cyclic and separating with respect
to Asmall. Then the modular Hamiltonian can be deﬁned through Hmod = − log(S†S).
It would be interesting to check that this should correspond to the bulk modular Hamil-
tonian for D − D.

Precursors have been discussed extensively in the literature. In [21], it was proposed
that Wilson loops may act as precursors building on the intuition that the bulk duals
of Wilson loops are string worldsheets that extend into the bulk, and may therefore
detect excitations in the interior. Although this is a natural guess, as pointed out
[22], this is incorrect. Wilson loops are dual to operators that create a perturbative
string excitation in the bulk. To the extent that perturbative string theory is local,
Wilson loop operators in a region of the boundary cannot detect information from a
causally disconnected region in the bulk. In the presence of such an excitation, Wilson
loops cannot be computed through a minimal area surface any longer. As explained in
[23], this is not dissimilar to the fact that, in the vacuum, correlation functions can be
computed in a geodesic approximation. However, while bulk geodesics do respond to
bulk excitations, this does not imply that boundary correlators are precursors; all that
happens is that the duality between correlators and geodesics duality breaks down in
the presence of a bulk excitation.

It is now believed, based on the HRT formula for the entanglement entropy of a
region [24] that the entanglement entropy does provide an example of a precursor that
is sensitive to bulk dynamics in the “entanglement wedge” of the region. A related
proposal was made in [23], where it was proposed that the modular Hamiltonian for a
region was dual to the Area operator for the minimal bulk surface. As we mentioned
earlier, an important diﬀerence between previous work and our study is that we are
considering a boundary region that has no non-trivial causal complement. Nevertheless,
locality emerges when we focus on simple operators, whereas non-local information is
stored in complex polynomials.

It is rather remarkable that we are able to construct a toy model of black hole
complementarity in this simple setting.
In empty AdS, we can only examine non-
locality on length scales that are the AdS radius. We believe that, in their essentials,

these ideas should also apply to ﬂat-space black holes, where we require non-locality
over the the distance that radiation travels in the evaporation time of the black hole.
However, it would be very interesting to understand this in greater detail.
