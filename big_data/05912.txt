Abstract. There is a Rota-Baxter algebra structure on the ﬁeld A = k((t)) with P being the projec-
tion map A = k[[t]] ⊕ t−1k[t−1] onto k[[t]]. We study the representation theory and regular-singular
decompositions of any ﬁnite dimensional A-vector space. The main result shows that the cate-
gory of ﬁnite dimensional representations is semisimple and consists of exactly three isomorphism
classes of irreducible representations which are all one-dimensional. As a consequence, the num-
ber of GLA(V)-orbits in the set of all regular-singular decompositions of an n-dimensional A-vector
space V is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2. We also use the result to compute the generalized class number, i.e.,
the number of the GLn(A)-isomorphism classes of ﬁnitely generated k[[t]]-submodules of An.

1. Introduction

1.1. A Rota-Baxter algebra of weight λ consists of an associative algebra A, equipped with a
linear operator P : A −→ A satisfying the Rota-Baxter relation:
(1)
P is called a Rota-Baxter operator of weight λ.

P(x)P(y) = P(P(x)y) + P(xP(y)) + λP(xy).

The study of Rota-Baxter algebras originated in the work of Baxter [Ba] on ﬂuctuation the-
ory, and the algebraic study was started by Rota [Rot1]. The theory of Rota-Baxter algebras
develops a general framework of the algebraic and combinatorial structures underlying inte-
gral calculus which is like diﬀerential algebras for diﬀerential calculus. Rota-Baxter algebra
also ﬁnds its applications in combinatorics, mathematics physics, operads and number theory
[Ag3, A-M, And, Bai, BBGN, BGP, Ca, C-K, C-K1, E, E-G1, E-G4, EGGV, E-Gs, G-Z].
See [Guw, Gub] (Guw,Gub) for further details.

P(

Elements of k((t)) is the completion of the local ring of rational functions around 0 with reg-
ular singularity. The operator P maps a function to its regular part. Thus a function f can be
decomposed into a sum f = ( f − P( f )) + P( f ). The Rota-Baxter relations suggests that P is
an integral operator of the function spaces with values in the space of regular functions. Such
a decomposition has found its application in the renormalization of quantum ﬁeld theory. See
[C-K, EGK3, EGM, C-M] for more details.

The concept of representations of Rota-Baxter algebras was introduced in [G-Lin]. Similar
to representations of the diﬀerential algebras, which can be thought as a vector bundle with a

connection, a representation of a Rota-Baxter algebra is a module of the algebra together with
an integral operator P. A representation can also be interpreted in terms of Feyman integrals of
vector bundles with a compatible integral operator, which decomposes a section into regular part
and singular part.

In this paper, we concentrate on the representations of the Rota-Baxter algebra A = k((t))
1.2.
with the Rota-Baxter operator P : A → A being the projection of A to O = k[[t]]. Through the
decomposition A = k[[t]] ⊕ t−1k[t−1] as k-vector spaces, we view A is ﬁeld of formal functions
around the point 0 with regular singularity at 0, then this decomposition is meant to decompose
each function into regular part (those in k[[t]]) and singular part (those in t−1k[t−1]). Such de-
composition is also reﬂected in the representations of the Rota-Baxter algebra. In fact for each
(A, P)-module (V, p) with V being an A-vector space, the pair of k-subspaces (p(V), ker(p)) de-
ﬁnes a decomposition V = p(V) ⊕ ker(p) of the k-vector space. Here p(V) is a k[[t]]-submodule
of V and ker(p) is a k[t−1]-submodule of V. We will call such decomposition of V as a regular-
singular decomposition (RSD for short) of V. We will prove that on any A-vector space V,
an (A, P)-module structure is equivalent to giving an RSD of V. We will study the isomorphism
classes of all RSDs of V under the group GLA(V)-action and use this to classify all (A, P)-modules
which are ﬁnite dimensional over A.

The ﬁeld A is a complete ﬁeld with a discrete evaluation and the ring of integers O = k[[t]]. In
fact O is a split complete discrete valuation in the sense that the residue ﬁeld is a subring. Each
representation (V, p) of dimension n as an A-vector space deﬁnes an O-submodule M = p(V),
which can be thought as an element of the set Gn(O) of all O-submodules. The group GLn(A) acts
on Gn(O). We will also study the GLn(A)-orbits in Gn(O). The map RB(V) → Gn(O) (p 7→ p(V))
is GLn(A)-equivariant. We will show that this map is ﬁber bundle with ﬁber GLn(O)-orbits of
k[t−1]-submodules of V.
It turns these structure are closely related the aﬃne Grassmannians
GLn(A)/GLn(O). The GLn(O) of k[t−1]-lattices in An opposite aﬃne Grassmannians.

Theorem 1.1. For the complete discrete valuation ﬁeld A = k((t)) with valuation ring O = k((t)),
and any n, the number of GLn(A)-orbits in Gn(O) is ﬁnite.

We remark that the ideal class group of a Dedekind domain can be arbitrarily large by a result of
Claborn [Cl, LG]. We don’t know if the theorem above holds with the complete discrete valuation
ring O replaced by any PID. One also notices that for any Dedekind domain D with ﬁeld K of
fractions. If Mn(D) is the set of all ﬁnitely generated D-submodules of Kn. The group GLn(K)
acts on Mn(D). If we denote by cln(D) = Mn(D)/GLn(K) the set of all GLn(K)-orbits in Mn(D).
Then M1(D)/GL1(K) is the ideal class group cl(D) of D and it acts on the set Mn(D)/GLn(K),
by J · M = JM for each fractional ideal J in K and each ﬁnitely generated D-submodule M of
Kn. One of the question is to describe the cl(D)-orbits in cln(D). In the case that D is complete
discrete evaluation ring, there are only ﬁnitely many cl(D)-orbits in cln(D) for all n.

1.3. The main results are the following.

(a) The category of representations of ﬁnite dimensional (A, P)-modules is a semisimple abelian
category with exactly three isomorphism classes of irreducible objects. They are (A, 0), (A, Id),
and (A, P) (Theorem ??).

(b) If V is an n-dimensional A-vector space, then the number of GLA(V)-orbits on the set of
≥0 with k + r + l = n

all RSDs of V is (n + 2)(n + 1)/2, which indexed by the triples (k, r, l) ∈ Z3
(Corollary 4.6).

(c) The number of GLn(A)-orbits in Gn(O) is ﬁnite and in one-to-one correspondence to the

isomorphism classes of n-dimensional RB-representations (Corollary 5.2).

(d) The GLn(A)-orbit of type (k, r, l) ∈ Z3

≥0 in Gn(O) is a ﬁbre bundle over the A-variety of all

ﬂags of type (k, r, l) with ﬁbre being the aﬃne Grassmanian GLr(A)/GLr(O).

(e) The GLn(A)-orbits in RSD(An) is also characterised as quotient groups (Theorem 5.6).
We remark that the set of all RSDs in V is closely related to aﬃne Grassmanians and has an
inﬁnite dimensional variety structure. The geometric structure of these orbits will be studied
elsewhere. Also the argument in the paper works for any complete discrete valuation ring in its
ﬁeld of fractions. The applications of vector bundles over curves will be studied in a future paper.

1.4. The main tool in classifying all representations on a ﬁnite dimensional A-vector space is
to ﬁrst classify all k[[t]]-submodules M of V. In case V is one-dimensional, then all such M

results, which might be well known to number theorists, is that M is a ﬁnitely generated O-module
if

are straightforward. For higher dimensions, each such M contains a largest k[[t]]-submodule eM
consisting of all divisible elements. eM is the largest A-subspace of V contained in M. One of the
˜M = 0. But we could not ﬁnd a good reference and provide a proof here. In particular M/eM
is a ﬁnitely generated k[[t]]-submodule of V/eM. Using this results, we are able to decompose

every (A, P)-module as direct sum of three types of modules, one part is p = 0, which will be
called trivial, one part is p = Id, and the part satisﬁes p(V) is lattice in V, which we will called
it regular. This was done in Section 3. In Section 4, we classify all regular modules. It turns out
that two regular modules are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension over A.

2. Regular-Singular decompositions of a module

In this section, we ﬁrst deﬁne the notion of a regular-singular decomposition (RSD) of vector
spaces for the Laurent series Rota-Baxter algebra. Then we give the deﬁnition of the Rota-Baxter
module (RB-module). Finally, we identify the RSDs with RB-modules.

Let O := k[[t]], then O is a complete discrete valuation ring with the maximal idea tO and k the
ﬁeld of residue. Its group of units is O∗ = GL1(O) = O\tO. Let A be the ﬁeld of fractions of O,
then A = k((t)) be the Laurent series algebra and A− := t−k[t−1] ⊆ k[t−1]. Then A = O ⊕ A− as k-
vector space. A has a Rota-Baxter algebra structure with Rota-Baxter operator P : A → A which
is the projection onto O under this direct sum decomposition. Although we are only interested in
the ﬁeld k for Rota-Baxter algebras.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let V be an A-vector space. A pair (M, N) of k-subspaces of V is called a regular-
singular decomposition (RSD) if

(a) V = M ⊕ N as k-vector space;
(b) M is an O-submodule of V;
(c) N is a k[t−1]-submodule of V.
Let

RSD(V) :=n(M, N)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (M, N) is a regular-singular decomposition of Vo .

4

ZONGZHU LIN AND LI QIAO

Let GLA(V) be the group of invertible A-linear transformations on V. Then GLA(V) acts on
RSD(V) by

φ(M, N) = (φ(M), φ(N)),

∀φ ∈ GLA(V).

Note that φ is A-linear, so φ(M) is an O-submodule of V and φ(N) is a k[t−1]-submodule.

Next we want to determine the GLA(V)-orbits in RSD(V).

Deﬁnition 2.2. An A-module V with a k-linear map p : V −→ V is called a Rota-Baxter (RB)-
module over (A, P) if
(2)
Such p is called a Rota-Baxter representation operator on V, the pair (V, p) is called an RB-
module over (A, P).

P(a)p(x) = p(P(a)x + ap(x) − ax),

∀a ∈ A, x ∈ V.

Let

RB(V) :=np : V −→ V (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) p is a Rota-Baxter representation operator on Vo .

An RB-module homomorphism f : (V, p) −→ (W, p′) between two RB-modules (V, p) and (W, p′)
is an A-module homomorphism f
: V −→ W such that f ◦ p = p′ ◦ f . (V, p) and (W, p′) are
isomorphism if f is an A-module isomorphism. In this case V (cid:27) W and p′ = f ◦ p ◦ f −1.

Then for an RB-algebra (A, P), the category of all RB-modules over (A, P) which are ﬁnitely
generated as A-modules is an abelian category. We are interested in classifying all isomorphism
classes of this category. For each ﬁxed ﬁnitely generated A-module V, the group GLA(V) acts on
the set RB(V) by conjugation φ · p = φ ◦ p ◦ φ−1 for any φ ∈ GLA(V), p ∈ RB(V).

Our goal is to classify the isomorphism classes of RB-module structures on V. This is amount

to classifying the GLA(V)-orbits in RB(V).
Proposition 2.3. For an A-module V, a k-linear map p : V −→ V is a Rota-Baxter representation
operator if and only if p satisﬁes the following conditions:

(a) p2 = p;
(b) p(V) is an O-submodule of V;
(c) Ker(p) is a k[t−1]-submodule of V.

Proof. It follows from Eq. (2) that p is a Rota-Baxter representation operator if and only if

( (i)

(ii)

ap(x) = p(ap(x)), ∀a ∈ O, x ∈ V;
p(ax) = p(ap(x)), ∀a ∈ k[t−1], x ∈ V.

Taking a = 1 in (i) or (ii), we have p2 = p. Furthermore, (i) implies that p(V) is an O-

submodule of V and (ii) implies ker(p) is a k[t−1]-submodule of V.

Conversely, assume that p satisﬁes (a), (b) and (c). Then for any a ∈ O, x ∈ V, the fact that
ap(x) ∈ p(V) implies that ap(x) = p(y), for some y ∈ V. By (a), we have p(y) = p(p(y)). Thus (i)
holds.

Similarly p2 = p, implies that x − p(x) ∈ ker(p) for all x ∈ V. By (c), a(x − p(x)) ∈ ker(p) for

any a ∈ k[t−1]. Thus p(a(x − p(x))) = 0 and p(ax) = p(ap(x)). Hence (ii) holds.

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.4. For any A-module V, the map Ψ : RB(V) −→ RSD(V) deﬁned by Ψ(p) =
(im(p), ker(p)) is a GLA(V)-equivalent bijection.
Proof. By Proposition 2.3, im(p) = p(V) is an O-submodule of V and ker(p) is a k[t−1]-submodule
of V. Since p2 = p, then V = im(p) ⊕ ker(p) as k-vector space. Hence, Ψ(p) = (im(p), ker(p)) is
a regular-singular decomposition of V.

It is straightforward to verify that

Ψ(φ ◦ p ◦ φ−1) = (φ(im(p)), φ(Ker(p))),

∀φ ∈ GLA(V).

To deﬁne the inverse map Ψ−1 : RSD(V) −→ RB(V), for each (M, N) ∈ RSD(V), one deﬁnes
p : V −→ V by p = pr|M the projection of V to M. Then p satisﬁes (a), (b) and (c) of Proposition
2.3. Hence for any (M, N) ∈ RSD(V), p ∈ RB(V), Ψ ◦ Ψ−1(M, N) = (M, N), Ψ−1 ◦ Ψ(p) = (p). (cid:3)

We will use Theorem 2.4 to classify the isomorphism classes of RB-module structure on an

A-module V.

Let us ﬁrst work on special case V = A and classify regular-singular decompositions of V up
to isomorphisms. It is easy to see that if M = A and N = 0, then p = id; if M = 0, N = A, then
p = 0.

Lemma 2.5. Let M ⊆ A be an O-submodule. If x =

Otn ⊆ M.

Proof. Let x =

∞Xi=n

citi = tn

ci+nti ∈ M and b :=

∞Xi=0

∞Xi=n

citi ∈ M where cn , 0, then tn ∈ M,

ci+nti where cn , 0. Then b ∈ O∗, that is b

∞Xi=0

is an invertible element in O. Thus we have b−1 ∈ O, tn = b−1x ∈ M and Otn ⊆ M.

(cid:3)

Let t ∈ O be the generator of the maximal idea of O, and for any x ∈ A, deﬁne

then ν(x) is the valuation of x at the unique maximal ideal (t) ⊆ O

ν(x) := min {n ∈ Z | x ∈ tnO },

Proposition 2.6. For V = A as A-module, if (M, N) ∈ RSD(A) and M , 0, M , A, then there
exists n ∈ Z such that M = Otn.

Proof. If M , 0 and M , A, then N , 0, N , A. Thus there exists 0 , z ∈ N with z =

citi(cm , 0). And for any 0 , x ∈ M, let x =

a jt j(an , 0), then n > m. Otherwise, if there

∞Xj=n

∞Xi=m

exists x ∈ M such that ν(x) ≤ m. Then tν(x)O ⊆ M, z ∈ tν(x)O ⊆ M gives a contradiction.

For any x ∈ M\{0}, z ∈ N\{0}, choose n to be minimal integer such that n ≥ ν(z). Then we

have M = Otn by the Lemma 2.5.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.7. Proposition 2.6 shows that for the complete discrete valuation ring O with ﬁeld
of fractions A, an O-submodule M of A is a fractional ideal if and only if M , A and M , 0.
Since the ideal class group of a discrete valuation ring is always identity, thus there is an element
0 , a ∈ A such that aM = O. The completeness is essential. This does not generalise to non-local
PIDs as one can easily ﬁnd k[t] submodules of k(t) that are not fractional ideals.

Corollary 2.8. For V = A as A-module, every (M, N) ∈ RSD(A) is isomorphic to (O, N′).

Proof. In fact, every RSD of A, which is neither divisible nor trivial, has the form (Otn, N) for
some n. Then apply the invertible φ ∈ GLA(V) deﬁned by φ(x) = tnx for any x ∈ V, and some
n.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.9. Let (O, N) be a regular-singular decomposition of A. Then there exist bn = t−n +rn(t)
with rn(t) ∈ O for any n ≥ 1 such that {bn | n ≥ 1} is a k-basis of N.

6

ZONGZHU LIN AND LI QIAO

Proof. Since A = O ⊕ N, then the restriction of the quotient map A → A/O to N deﬁnes a k-linear
isomorphism A/O (cid:27) N. Let bn be the inverse image of t−n for each n ≥ 1. Then bn has the
required form.
Lemma 2.10. For any n ≥ 1, bn ∈ k[t−1]b1,
Proof. We use induction on n ≥ 1 to prove the statement. If n = 1, it is clear that b1 ∈ k[t−1]b1.
For n ≥ 2, assume that bn ∈ k[t−1]b1 . Then

(cid:3)

bn+1 − t−1bn + rn(0)b1 = t−n−1 + rn+1(t) − t−n−1 − t−1rn(t) + rn(0)t−1 + rn(0)r1(t)

= −(rn(t) − rn(0))t−1 + rn+1(t) + rn(0)r1(t) ∈ O.

Since bn+1 − t−1bn + rn(0)b1 ∈ N, we have bn+1 − t−1bn + rn(0)b1 = 0. Then by induction

assumption bn+1 = t−1bn − rn(0)b1 ∈ k[t−1]b1.
Proposition 2.11. Let (O, N) ∈ RSD(A). Then there exists b ∈ O∗ such that N = A−b.
Proof. We have N ⊆ k[t−1]b1 ⊆ N. Write b1 = t−1b where b = 1 +t ·r1(t) ∈ O∗, then N = A−b. (cid:3)
Theorem 2.12. Let (M, N) ∈ RSD(A), then either (M, N) = (A, 0), or (M, N) = (0, A), or
(M, N) (cid:27) (O, A−).

(cid:3)

Proof. By Corollary 2.8, we can assume M = O. Now by Proposition 2.11, we can assume
N = A−1b for some b ∈ O∗. The map φ : A → A deﬁned by φ(x) = xb−1 satisﬁes φ(O) = O.
Hence, φ(O, N) = (O, A−).

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.13. There are exactly three isomorphism classes of Rota-Baxter (A, P)-modules on
V = A. They are p = 0, p = Id, and p = P.

3. Finite generation and regular-singular decomposition in higher ranks

Let us recall that for an O-module M, an element x ∈ M is called divisible if for any 0 , a ∈ O,

there is a y ∈ M such that x = ay. We call M divisible if every element is divisible.

If M = A, then M is divisible. We will say that the corresponding RB-module is divisible .
When M = 0, we will say the corresponding RB-module is trivial since p = 0. An RB-module
(V, p) is called regular is it does not have nonzero trivial and nonzero divisible submodules.

Before we proceed to classify all RB-modules over A, we need to prove a result that every
O-submodule M of a ﬁnite dimensional A-vector space V is ﬁnitely generated if and only if M
has no divisible vector. The result in this section works for any complete discrete valuation ring
O with A being the ﬁeld of fractions. The results in this section should be well-known to number
theorists on fractional submodules in a ﬁnite dimensional vector space, but we could not ﬁnd a
good reference and thus provide a proof here for the readers’ convenience. This result is deﬁnitely
false for Z by considering the Z[q−1]-submodules of V for any prime number q.

3.1. Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional A-vector space and M ⊆ V be an O-submodule. Let

Then eM is the set of all divisible elements in M and eM ⊆ V is an A-vector subspace.
It is clear that if M is a ﬁnitely generated O-submodule of V, then eM = {0} since M is torsion-

free and thus a ﬁnitely generated free submodule of V.

Assume that M is an O-submodule of an A-vector space V. For any 0 , x ∈ V, let

eM = {x ∈ M | Ax ∈ M}.

IM(x) := {a ∈ A | ax ∈ M}.

REPRESENTATIONS OF ROTA-BAXTER ALGEBRAS AND REGULAR-SINGULAR DECOMPOSITIONS

7

Then IM(x) is an O-submodule of A. By Proposition 2.6, exactly one of the following three cases
appears: (a) IM(x) = A if and only if Ax ⊆ M, (b) IM(x) = {0} if and only if Ax ∩ M = {0}, and (c)
IM(x) = Otn for some n ∈ Z if and only if {0} ( Ax ∩ M ( Ax.
Deﬁnition 3.1. We call a regular-singular decomposition (M, N) of an A-vector space V regular

regular-singular decomposition is regular.

if eM = {0} and AM = V. We say that an RB-module over (A, P) is regular, if the corresponding
We will prove in Theorem 3.5 that eM = 0 implies that M is a ﬁnitely generated O-module and

thus M is O-free of ﬁnite rank. Thus (M, N) is regular if and only if M is a lattice in V. We will
classify all regular RSDs in V in Section 4.

We remark that the regularity condition corresponding to regular D-modules over a curve (see
[HTT, 5.1.3]). Also (M, N) is regular if and only if the corresponding RB-module does not have
nonzero divisible and nonzero trivial RB-submodules, as we have deﬁned earlier.

For any x ∈ V\{0}, deﬁne

νM(x) := min{n ∈ Z | tnx ∈ M}.

It should be noted that it is possible that νM(x) = −∞ or +∞.
Proposition 3.2. Let V be an A-vector space and M ⊆ V an O-submodule. For any 0 , x ∈ V,

νM(x) = −∞, or IM(x) = {0} with νM(x) = +∞.

tnx < M for all n ∈ Z, then IM(x) = {0} and Ax ∩ M = {0}.

then either there exists n ∈ Z such that IM(x) = Otn with n = νM(x) or IM(x) = A with x ∈ eM and
Proof. If eM is nonempty, then 0 , x ∈ eM if and only if IM(x) = A. In this case νM(x) = −∞. If
For 0 , x ∈ V\eM with {0} ( Ax ∩ M ( Ax, there exists n ∈ Z such that tnx ∈ M and tn−1x < M.

Since M is an O-submodule, then we have Otnx ⊆ M, i.e. Otn ⊆ IM(x) and Otn−1 < IM(x). Since
O is a DVR, and all fractional ideals of O in A are of the form Otm with m ∈ Z (see the proof of
Proposition 2.6). Hence IM(x) = Otn with n = νM(x).
Lemma 3.3. Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional A-vector space and M ⊆ V an O-submodule.
If
0 , z ∈ M, set V := V/Az. For the quotient map π : V → V, we deﬁne M := π(M) ⊆ V as an

(cid:3)

replacing z with tkz and then we can assume that z ∈ M and t−1z < M. So we have for any a ∈ A,
az ∈ M if and only if a ∈ O, i.e., IM(z) = O.

O-submodule of V. If eM = {0}, then eM = {0}.
Proof. If eM = {0}, then, by Proposition 3.2, there exists k ∈ Z such that IM(z) = Otk. Now
Suppose, on the contrary, that eM , {0}. Then there exists y ∈ M such that 0 , y = π(y) ∈ M
Since eM = {0}, then there exists m ∈ Z such that I(y) = Otm. Similar to the case of z, replacing

and IM(y) = A.

y with tmy, we can take y ∈ M such that
(3)
Note that y and z are A-linearly independent in V.

IM(y) = O i.e., νM(y) = 0, and IM(y) = A.

By assumption, t−ny + Az ∈ M for each n ∈ N. Thus there exists an ∈ A such that xn =
t−ny − anz ∈ M. Write an = tν(an)rn with rn ∈ O. Since t−1y < M and z ∈ M, then ν(an) < 0 when
n > 0.

Since t−ny = xn +anz, we have ν(an) = −n. In fact, by considering t−n−ν(an)y = t−ν(an)xn +rnz ∈ M,
we have −n − ν(an) ≥ 0 and then ν(an) ≤ −n. Similarly, tν(an)+nrnz = y − tnxn ∈ M implies
ν(an) ≥ −n. Thus an = t−nrn with rn ∈ O∗ and xn = t−n(y − rnz) ∈ M.

8

For n = 1, we have r1 , 0 and y − r1z = tx1 ∈ tM. If we write r1 := c1 + td with c1 ∈ k and

d ∈ O, then y − c1z ∈ tM.

Denote y1 := y and then y1 − c1z ∈ tM. Denote y2 := t−n1(y1 − c1z) ∈ M for some n1 ≥ 1 such
that t−1y2 < M. Then y2 = t−n1y1 , 0 and y2 still satisﬁes the same condition (3) as y1 does. Hence
there exists c2 ∈ k such that y2 − c2z ∈ tM.

Inductively, for each ℓ ∈ N+, we denote yℓ := t−nℓ−1(yℓ−1 − cℓ−1z) ∈ M with nℓ−1 ≥ 1 such that

t−1yℓ < M and there exists cℓ ∈ k such that yℓ − cℓz ∈ tM.

Since yℓ = t−nℓ−1(yℓ−1 − cℓ−1z) ∈ M, we have yℓ−1 = tnℓ−1yℓ + cℓ−1z.

Remark 3.4. In the proof we only used the property that O is a complete discrete valuation ring.
The fact that the residue ﬁeld k is a subring of O is not essential as one can choose ci ∈ O
invertible.

Theorem 3.5. Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional A-vector space and M ⊆ V an O-submodule. If

eM = {0}, then M is a ﬁnitely generated O-submodule of V.

Proof. We use induction on dimA V. If dimA V = 1, take any basis z ∈ M, then IM(z) = Otk for
some k ∈ Z, thus for any a ∈ A, a · tkz ∈ M if and only if a ∈ O, i.e. M = O · tkz.

Assume that the theorem is true for any vector spaces of dim V < n, we now consider dim V =

n ≥ 2.

Take 0 , z ∈ M, and V := V/Az, for the quotient map π : V −→ V, we deﬁne M = π(M) ⊆ V

be an O-submodule. By Lemma 3.3,eM = {0}. By the induction assumption, M is a ﬁnitely

generated O-submodule of V. Then we have a short exact sequence of O-modules:

0 → M ∩ Az → M → M → 0.

Because of Az is 1-dimensional, M ∩ Az is an O-submodule of Az, and ]M ∩ Az = {0}, then
M ∩ Az is generated by one element. So M can be generated by ﬁnitely many elements as an
O-module.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.6. Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional A-vector space. If M is an O-submodule of V such

that eM = {0}, then M is a free O-module of rank dimA AM.

Proof. O is a DVR, a ﬁnitely generated module is free if and only if it is torsion free.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.7. Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional A-vector space. If M is an O-submodule of V, then

there is an A-linear decomposition V = eM ⊕ V0 such that M = eM ⊕ M f with M f = M ∩ V0 being
a free O-module of rank dimA AM − dimA eM.
Proof. Deﬁne V = V/eM with the quotient map π : V → V which is an A-linear map. Then
M = M/eM is an O-submodule of V. We now show that eM = {0}. Indeed, eM is an A-subspace of
V then π−1(eM) is an A-subspace of V. Since eM ⊆ M, we have π−1(eM) ⊆ M. Hence π−1(eM) ⊆ eM.
Thus eM = {0}. Now by Corollary 3.6, M is a free O-module and the exact sequence

of O-modules splits. Let M f be the image of a splitting map (of O-modules). Thus we have

0 → eM → M → M → 0

(cid:3)

generated (and thus a free) k[t−1]-module.

V = ˜M ⊕ V0 with V0 be an A-subspace of V containing M f .

M = eM ⊕ M f with M f being free of rank dimA AM = dimA AM − dimA ˜M. Now decompose
Similar to the deﬁnition of eM, for a k[t−1]-submodule N, we deﬁne eN = {x ∈ N | Ax ⊆ N}.
Then eN is an A-subspace of V. In general, N/eN is not a ﬁnitely generated k[t−1]-submodule.
However, the following theorem implies that when (M, N) is in RSD(V), then N/eN is a ﬁnitely
decomposition of V = eM ⊕ V0 ⊕ eN as A-vector space and there is (M f , N f ) in RSD(V0) such that
M = eM ⊕ M f as O-module and N = eN ⊕ N f as k[t−1]-module, M f is a free O-module of ﬁnite

rank and N f is a free k[t−1]-module of ﬁnite rank and V0 = AM f = AN f .
Proof. Consider V1 = AM, which is an A-subspace of V. Let σ : V → V/V1 be the A-linear
quotient map. Then σ(N) is a k[t−1]-submodule of V/V1. Since V = M ⊕ N as a k-vector space.
Hence, σ(N) = V/V1 as k-vector spaces. Let N1 = N ∩ V1. Then we have an exact sequence

Theorem 3.8. Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional A-vector space. If (M, N) ∈ RSD(V), then there is a

0 → N1 → N → σ(N) → 0.

We cannot claim that this sequence of k[t−1]-modules splits. However, since σ is A-linear,
we can choose {v1, · · · , vs} ⊆ N such that {σ(v1), · · · , σ(vs)} is an A-basis of V/V1. We claim
In fact under the k-linear projection map, pM : V → M, we have
that A{v1, · · · , vs} ⊆ N.
pM(A{v1, · · · , vs}) = 0 since V1 ∩ A{v1, · · · , vs} = 0. We now claim that N = N1 ⊕ A{v1, · · · , vs}. It
is straightforward to verify that (M, N1) is in RSD(V1).

We know that eM ⊆ V1 is an A-subspace of V1. The above corollary 3.7 implies that V1 = eM ⊕V0
for an A-subspace of V1 such that M0 = V0 ∩M is an O-free module of ﬁnite rank and M = eM ⊕M0

as O-module. It follows from the proof of the corollary 3.7, one can choose V0 such that N1 ⊆ V0
and further more, V0 = AN1. Then (M0, N1) is a regular-singular decomposition for the A-vector
space V0.

4. Classification of finite dimensional regular RB-modules

4.1.
In this section, we assume that (M, N) is in RSD(V) satisﬁes the condition that M is ﬁnitely
generated O-module and V = AM. Let RSDr(V) be the set of all such RSDs of V. Under this
assumption, M contains an A-basis. Since M is free of ﬁnite rank n = dimA V over O (i.e., M is
an O-lattice in V), then there exist v1, v2, · · · , vn ∈ M such that M = ⊕n
i=1Ovi, and (v1, v2, · · · , vn)
is an A-basis. Thus M (cid:27) On. From now on, we use this basis and identify V = An and On ⊆ An.

For any lattice M in V = An, there is φ ∈ GLn(A) such that φ(On) = M. Note that, for
φ ∈ GLA(V), φ(On) = On implies that φ ∈ GLn(O). Thus the set of all lattices in V is in one-to-one
correspondence to the aﬃne Grassmannian GLn(A)/GLn(O). Thus for each ﬁxed dimension n, the
map Φ : RSDr(V) → GLn(A)/GLn(O), deﬁned by (M, N) 7→ φGLn(O) such that M = φ(On), is a
ﬁber bundle and GLn(A)-equivariant in the sense that Φ(φ(M, N)) = φΦ(M, N) for all φ ∈ GLn(A).
Our main goal in this section is to compute the ﬁber of this map.

Let {v1, · · · , vn} be the standard A-basis of V = An. Then On = ⊕n

i=1Ovi and V/On has a k-basis
{t− jvi | j ≥ 1, i = 1, 2, · · · , n}. The k-vector space isomorphism N (cid:27) V/On induced via restriction
of the quotient map V → V/On to N deﬁnes a k-basis {b ji | j ≥ 1, i = 1, 2, · · · , n} of N such that
b ji = t− jvi + r ji(t) with r ji(t) ∈ On.

Lemma 4.1. For any m ∈ Z+ and 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n, we have bmℓ ∈

nXi=1

k[t−1]b1i.

Proof. We use induction on m. If m = 1, it’s clear. For m ≥ 2, assume that bmℓ ∈

Then

nXi=1

k[t−1]b1i.

b(m+1)ℓ = t−1bmℓ − t−1rmℓ(t) + r(m+1)ℓ(t)

= t−1bmℓ − t−1rmℓ(0) − t−1(rmℓ(t) − rmℓ(0)) + r(m+1)ℓ(t).

Note that t−1(rmℓ(t) − rmℓ(0)) ∈ On. If we write rmℓ(0) =

nXj=1

aib1i −

nXi=1

air1i(t). Thus we have b(m+1)ℓ ∈

k[t−1]b1i + On.

nXi=1

aivi with ai ∈ k, we have t−1rmℓ(0) =

nXi=1

nXi=1

Write b(m+1)ℓ = u + v with u ∈

k[t−1]b1i and v ∈ On. Since

k[t−1]b1i ⊆ N and b(m+1)ℓ ∈ N,

nXi=1

nXi=1

thus v = b(m+1)ℓ − u ∈ N. Therefore v = 0 since N ∩ On = {0}. Hence b(m+1)ℓ ∈

nXi=1

k[t−1]b1i.

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.2. If (On, N) ∈ RSD(V), then N is a free k[t−1]-module of rank n with a basis
In particular, there is a φ ∈ GLn(O) such that
{bi
φ(t−1vi) = bi for i = 1, 2, · · · , n.

| i = 1, 2, · · · , n} where bi ∈ t−1vi + On.

Proof. By Lemma 4.1, we have N ⊆

k[t−1]b1i ⊆ N. Then {b1i | i = 1, · · · , n} is a k[t−1]-basis

of N. Write bi = b1i. The A-linear map φ : An → An deﬁned by φ(vi) = vi + tr1i(t) is invertible

and φ ∈ GLn(O) since φ(On) = On, and N = φ(

k[t−1]t−1vi).

Corollary 4.3. The set of all k[t−1]-submodules N of An such that (M, N) ∈ RSD(An) is the
GLn(O)-orbit of t−1k[t−1]n which is in bijection to GLn(O)/GLn(k).
Proof. Clearly for any φ ∈ GLn(O), (On, φ(t−1k[t−1]n)) is also in RSD(An). For any (On, N), there
is ψ ∈ GLn(A) such that ψ(On, t−1k[t−1]n) = (On, N), we have ψ(On) = On. Hence ψ ∈ GLn(O).
In futher ψ(t−1k[t−1]n) = t−1k[t−1]n, then ψ ∈ GLn(k[t−1]). Thus ψ ∈ GLn(O) ∩ GLn(k[t−1]) =
GLn(k).

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.4. If (V, p) is a regular RB-module for (A, P) of dimension n, then (V, p) (cid:27) (A, P)⊕n.

Proof. Since (V, p) is regular, we can ﬁnd an A-basis {v1, · · · , vn} such that p(V) =

nXi=1

Ovi. By

Proposition 4.2, there is φ ∈ GLA(V) such that φ(

Ovi) =

Ovi and (φ(t−1v1), · · · , φ(t−1vn) is

nXi=1

nXi=1

a k[t−1]-basis of ker(p). Thus φ : (A, P)⊕n → (V, p) deﬁnes an isomorphism of RB-modules over
(A, P).

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.5. Every RB-module over (A, P) is semisimple. The category of RB-modules has
exactly three isomorphism classes of irreducible (A, P)-modules. They are Ar = (A, P), A0 =
(A, 0), and A1 = (A, Id).

The following corollary has other geometric applications. The group GLn(A) acts on the set
RSD(A⊕n) of all RSDs of V. This set carries of structure of inﬁnite dimensional variety, which
we will not pursue here.

Corollary 4.6. The set RB(A⊕n) has exactly (n + 2)(n + 1)/2 many GLn(A)-orbits, which are
classiﬁed by (k, r, l) ∈ Z3

≥0 with k + r + l = n.

Corollary 4.7. For any O-submodule M ⊆ V, there is a regular-singular decomposition (M, N) ∈
RSD(V). Two (A, P)-modules (V, p) and (V ′, p′) are isomorphic if and any only there is an A-
linear isomorphism φ : V → V ′ such that φ(p(V)) = p′(V ′). In particular, (V, p) is uniquely
determined by the O-submodule p(V) ⊆ V.

Proof. By Corollary 3.7, M = eM ⊕ M f . By Corollary 4.6, there exists an N such that V =
eM ⊕ V0 ⊕ eN. Hence (M, N) is an RSD of V.

We remark that the linear map φ in the corollary is not an RB-module morphism. However,

(cid:3)

there is a ψ ∈ GLn(O) so that ψφ is an isomorphism.

5. Orbits and stabilisers

5.1.
In this subsection, let O be any integral domain and A be its ﬁeld of fractions. For any
ﬁnite dimensional A-vector space V = An with ﬁxed O-lattice VO = On, we consider the set
of all O-submodules M of V. M is called a fractional O-submodule if there is γ ∈ GLn(A)
such that γ(M) ⊆ VO. Clearly GLn(A) acts on the set Mn(O) of all fractional O-submodules of
An. We are interested in classifying all GLn(A)-orbits Mn(O)/GLn(A). In case n = 1, the set
1(O) being the set of all non-zero
M∗
fractional ideals, and has a monoid structure and cl(O) acts on Mn(O)/GLn(A). When O is a
Dedekind domain, then cl(O) is an abelian group acting on the set Mn(O)/GLn(A).

1(O)/GL1(A) = cl(O) is exactly the ideal classes of O, with M∗

Proposition 5.1. Assume that O is a split complete discrete valuation ring. For any n ≥ 1 we
have: (a) an O-submodule M is fractional if and only if it is has no nonzero divisible elements;
(b) |Mn(O)/GLn(A)| = n + 1 and the orbit of M is completely determined by dimA(AM).
Proof. (a) follows from Theorem 3.3 and the Remark 3.1. (b) follows from Corollary 3.6.

(cid:3)

Let Mr

n(O) be the subset of all fractional O-submodules of O-rank r in An and GR(n, r) the
set of all r-dimensional A-subspaces, then we have a map Mr
n(O) → GR(n, r) with M 7→ AM.
This map is GLn(A)-equivariant with ﬁber being the GLr(A)/GLr(O). Let Gn(O) be the set of all
O-submodules of An.

Again GLn(A) acts on Gn(O). Note that Mn(O) is a subset of Gn(O). By Corollary 4.7, the map

RSD(V) → Gn(O) is surjective and it induces a bijection RSD(An)/GLn(A) → Gn(O)/GLn(A).
Corollary 5.2. When O is a complete discrete valuation ring, then Gn(O)/GLn(A) has exactly
(n + 2)(n + 1)/2 many elements and each orbit corresponds to exactly one isomorphism class of
n-dimensional representations of the Rota-Baxter algebra A.

GLn−r(A)-orbits in Mn−r(O).

Let Φn : RSD(An) → Gn(O) such that Φn(M, N) = M. This map is GLn(A)-equivariant. Each

Proof. Using Corollary 3.5, each M is decomposed into M = eM ⊕ M f . The GLn(A) orbit of M
is completely determined by dimA eM = r and M f ⊆ An−r. For each r there exactly n − r + 1
GLn(A)-orbit in Gn(O) is determined by a pair of non-negative integers (dimA eM, dimA(AM f )) =

(k, r) with r + f ≤ n. Suppose M is in the orbit corresponding to (k, r), then stabiliser group

Fld1,d2,d3(A) be the subset of Fl3(V) of all generalised ﬂags of type (d1, d2, d3), i.e, the ﬁltrations of
A-subspaces 0 = V0 ⊆ V1 ⊆ V2 ⊆ V3 = V with dimA Vi/Vi−1 = di for i = 1, 2, 3.

GLn(A) acts on Fl3(V) and each Fld1,d2,d3(A) is a GLn(A)-orbit. There is a surjective GLn(A)-
equivariant map ρ : Gn(O) → Fl3(V) sending the O-submodule M ⊆ V to V1 = ˜M ⊆ V2 = AM ⊆
V3 = V. Then ρ−1(Fld1,d2,d3(A)) is a GLn(A)-orbit in Gn(O). This gives a complete description of
all GLn(A)-orbits in Gn(O).

so, we ﬁrst describe stabiliser GM,N. We recall that the category of (A, P)-modules form an abelian
category by [G-Lin]. Then the stabiliser G(M,N) = {g ∈ GLn(A) | gM = M, gN = N} is isomorphic
to the automorphism group the corresponding representation (An, pM) with pM : An → An is the
projection map onto M with respect to the regular-singular decomposition An = M ⊕N as k-vector

There are three irreducible representations of the Rota-Baxter algebra (A, P), which are all one

dimensional with operator being 0, Id, and P respectively are denoted by

A0 := (A, 0), A1 := (A, Id), Ar := (A, p).

Since Hom(A,P)(A, A) consists of A-linear maps, that is for any ϕ ∈ Hom(A,P)(A, A), and any x ∈ A,
we have ϕ(x) = xϕ(1). So ϕ is determined by ϕ(1).

Proposition 5.4.

(a) For any i, j = 0, 1, r, if i , j, then Hom(A,P)(Ai, A j) = 0;

(b) End(A,P)(A0) = End(A,P)(A1) = A as k-algebra;
(c) End(A,P)(Ar) = k.

Proof. (a) It is easy to get Hom(A,P)(A0, A1) = Hom(A,P)(A1, A0) = Hom(A,P)(Ar, A0) = 0. So we
only need to prove Hom(A,P)(A0, Ar) = Hom(A,P)(A1, Ar) = Hom(A,P)(Ar, A1) = 0.

For any ϕ ∈ Hom(A,P)(A0, Ar) satisﬁes P ◦ ϕ = ϕ ◦ 0. And for any x ∈ A0, we have

P(ϕ(x)) = ϕ(0(x)) = 0.

That is P(xϕ(1)) = 0, then xϕ(1) ∈ ker P for all x ∈ A0. Thus ϕ(1) = 0.

Similarly, we have Hom(A,P)(A1, Ar) = Hom(A,P)(Ar, A1) = 0.

(b) For any ϕ ∈ End(A,P)(A0) (or ϕ ∈ End(A,P)(A1)), since both maps 0, 1 : A → A are A-linear and
ϕ is also A-linear, that is ϕ(1) can be any element of A.
(c) For ϕ ∈ End(A,P)(Ar), we have ϕ ◦ P = P ◦ ϕ. Note that P is not A-linear. For any x ∈ A, we
have ϕ(x) = xϕ(1). So we only need to compute ϕ(1). From ϕ(1) = ϕ(P(1)) = P(ϕ(1)), we have

ϕ(1) ∈ O, that is ϕ(1) =

G/H × G/K is the set of the pairs (M, N) with M being an O-lattice in V and N be a k[t−1]-lattice.
The double cosets K G/H is in bijection to the G-orbits in G/H ×G/K. This spaces are important
subject of study in Lie representation theory. RS D(V) is the G-orbit of (K, H) in G/K × G/H. Or
it corresponds to the double coset KH in G. It would be interesting to describe all double cosets
G as a certain space of representations of the Rota-Baxter algebra (A, P) of dimension n. This
