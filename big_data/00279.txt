Abstract

In this paper we want to propose practical eﬃcient numerical methods to solve a
class of initial-boundary problem of time-space fractional convection-diﬀusion equa-
tions (TSFCDEs). To start with, an implicit method based on two-sided weighted
shifted Gr¨unwald formulae is proposed with a discussion of the stability and consis-
tency. The established implicit diﬀerence scheme can be veriﬁed that it converges
with second order accuracy in both time and space even for time variable coeﬃ-
cients. Extensive numerical example are reported to illustrate the eﬀectiveness of
the proposed implicit diﬀerence methods.

treatment of this subject. Many phenomena in engineering, physics, chemistry and other
sciences can be described very successfully by models using mathematical tools from frac-
tional calculus, i.e., the theory of derivatives and integrals of fractional order. Diﬀerential
equations with fractional order have recently proved to be valuable tools for the mod-
elling of many physical phenomena [1, 3]. Diﬀusion with an additional velocity ﬁeld and
diﬀusion under the inﬂuence of a constant external force ﬁeld are, in the Brownian case,
both modelled by the convection-dispersion equation. In the case of anomalous diﬀusion
this is no longer true, i.e., the fractional generalisation may be diﬀerent for the advection
case and the transport an external force ﬁeld in [4]. In the study, we are very interested in
the fast solver for solving the initial-boundary value problem of the time-space fractional
convection-diﬀusion equation (TSFCDE) [5, 6]:

0,tu(x, t) = γ(t) ∂u(x,t)

(1.1)

where α ∈ (0, 1], β ∈ (1, 2], a < x < b, and 0 < t ≤ T . Here, the parameters α and β are
the order of the TSFCDE, f (x, t) is the source term, and diﬀusion coeﬃcient functions
d±(t) are non-negative under the assumption that the ﬂow is from left to right. Moreover,
the variable coeﬃcients γ(t) are real. The TSFCDE can be regarded as generalizations of
classical convection-diﬀusion equations with the ﬁrst-order time derivative replaced by the
Caputo fractional derivative of order α ∈ (0, 1], and the second-order space derivatives
replaced by the two-sided Riemman-Liouville fractional derivative of order β ∈ (1, 2].
Namely, the time fractional derivative in (1.1) is the Caputo fractional derivative of order
α [1] denoted by

where Γ(·) denotes the Gamma function. Truly, when α = 1 and β = 2, the above
equation reduces to the classical convection-diﬀusion equation (CDE).
The fractional CDE has been recently investigated by a number of authors. It is pre-
sented as a useful approach for the description of transport dynamics in complex systems
which are governed by anomalous diﬀusion and non-exponential relaxation patterns [4,5].
The fractional CDE is also used in groundwater hydrology research to model the trans-
port of passive tracers carried by ﬂuid ﬂow in a porous medium [8]. Though analytic
approaches, such as the Fourier transform method, the Laplace transform methods, and

2

the Mellin transform method, have been proposed to seek closed-form solutions [1, 6, 9],
there are very few FDEs whose analytical closed-form solutions are available. There-
fore, the research on numerical approximation and techniques for the solution of FDEs
has attracted intensive interest. Most early established numerical methods are devel-
oped for handling the space factional CDE or the time fractional CDE. For space frac-
tional CDEs, many researchers exploited the conventional shifted Gr¨unwald discretiza-
tion [14] and the implicit Euler (or Crank-Nicolson) time-step discretization for two-sided
Riemman-Liouville fractional derivatives and the ﬁrst order time derivative, respectively.
Then they constructed many numerical approaches for solving the space fractional CDE,
refer to [14, 27, 28, 36, 41, 42, 44, 50, 52, 53, 55, 57] and references therein for details. Later,
Chen and Deng combined the second-order spatial discretization with the Crank-Nicolson
temporal discretization for producing the novel numerical methods, which archive the sec-
ond order accuracy in both time and space for space fractional CDE [12,13]. Even Chen &
Deng and Qu et al. separately designed the fast computational techniques, which can also
reduce the required algorithmic storage, for implementing the above mentioned second
order numerical methods; see [13, 17] for details. Additionally, there are also some other
interesting numerical methods for space fractional CDE, refer, e.g., to [29, 32, 48, 56–58]
for a discussion of these issues.

On the other hand, for time fractional CDE, many early implicit numerical methods
are derived by the combination of the L1 approximate formula [22] for Caputo fractional
derivative and the ﬁrst/second order spatial discretization. These numerical methods
are unconditionally convergent with the O(τ 2−α + h) or O(τ 2−α + h2) accuracy, where
τ and h are time-step size and spatial grid size, respectively.
In order to improve the
spatial accuracy, Cui [30, 34] and Mohebbi & Abbaszadeh [51] proposed, respectively, two
compact exponential methods and a compact ﬁnite diﬀerence method for a time fractional
convection-subdiﬀusion equation so that the spatial accuracy is improved to the fourth-
order. However, the methods and analyses in [30, 51] are only for the equations with
constant coeﬃcients. In particular, the discussions in [51] are limited to a special time
fractional convection-subdiﬀusion equation where the diﬀusion and convection coeﬃcients
are assumed to be one. In addition, some other related numerical methods are already
for handling the time fractional CDE, see e.g. [31, 33, 43, 46, 47, 49] for details.

On contrast, although the numerical methods for the space (or time) fractional CDE
are extensively treated in the past research, the work about numerically handling the
TSFCDE is not too much. Firstly, Zhang [20,26], Shao & Ma [21], Qin & Zhang [45], and
Liu et al. [53] have worked out a series of studies about constructing the implicit diﬀerence
schemes for TSFCDE, however all these numerical schemes can archive the convergence
with ﬁrst order accuracy in both space and time from the both theoretical and numerical
perspectives. Moreover, Liu et al. [18, 53], Zhao et al. [19], and Shen et al. [37] have
considered to solve the more general form of TSFCDE, in which the ﬁrst-order space
derivative is replaced by the two-sided Riemman-Liouville fractional derivative of order
ν ∈ (0, 1). Again, their numerical methods cannot enjoy the convergence with second
order accuracy in both space and time. In addition, some other eﬃcient approaches are
also developed for dealing with TSFCDE numerically. Moreover, most of these numerical
methods have no complete theoretical analyses for the convergence and stability; refer

3

to [35, 38–40, 54] for details.

In this paper, we ﬁrstly derive an implicit diﬀerence scheme for solving the TSFCDE
(1.1) and then verify that the proposed scheme can archive the stability and convergence
with second order accuracy in both space and time, i.e. O(τ 2 + h2) from the both the-
oretical and numerical perspectives. As far as we know, the scheme is the ﬁrst one who
can have the convergence with O(τ 2 + h2).
The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we establish an im-
plicit diﬀerence scheme for (1.1) and prove that this scheme is unconditionally stable and
convergent with O(τ 2 + h2) order accuracy. Finally, we present numerical experiments to
illustrate the eﬀectiveness of our numerical approaches in Section 3 and provide concluding
remarks in Section 4.

Implicit diﬀerence scheme

In this section, we present an implicit diﬀerence method for solving (1.1) by discretizing
the TSFCDE deﬁned by (1.1). Unlike former numerical approaches with the ﬁrst order
accuracy in both time and space [18–21, 26], we exploit henceforth two-sided fractional
derivatives to approximate the Riemann-Liouville derivatives in (1.3) and (1.4). We can
show that, by two-sided fractional derivatives, this proposed method is also uncondition-
ally stable and convergent under second order accuracy in time and space.

2.1 Numerical discretization of the TSFCDE

In order to derive the proposed scheme, we ﬁrst introduce some notations.

In the
rectangle ¯QT = {(x, t) : a ≤ x ≤ b, 0 ≤ t ≤ T} we introduce the mesh ̟hτ = ̟h ×
̟τ , where ̟h = {xi = ih, i = 0, 1, . . . , N; hN = b − a}, and ̟τ = {tj = jτ, j =
0, 1, . . . , M; τ = T /M}. Besides, v = {vi | 0 ≤ i ≤ N} be any grid function. Then, the
following lemma introduced in [10] gives a description on the time discretization.

In this section, we analyze the stability and convergence for the implicit scheme (2.12).

Let

Vh = {v | v = {vi} is a grid function on ̟h and vi = 0 if i = 0, N}

For ∀u, v ∈ Vh, we deﬁne the discrete inner product and the corresponding discrete L2

where c is a positive constant independent of the spatial step size h.

From above obtained conclusions it follows that if the solution and input data of
problem (1.1) are suﬃciently smooth, the solution of implicit diﬀerence scheme (2.12)
converges to the solution of the time-space fractional diﬀerential equation with the rate
equal to the order of the approximation error O(h2 + τ 2).

3 Numerical results

In this section we carry out three numerical examples with both constant and time
variable coeﬃcients in Eq. (1.1) to illustrate the performance and powerfulness of the
proposed implicit diﬀerence scheme for solving the TSFCDE (2.12). All experiments were
performed on a Windows 7 (64 bit) PC-Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3740 CPU 3.20 GHz, 8 GB
of RAM using MATLAB 2014a with machine epsilon 10−16 in double precision ﬂoating
point arithmetic.

For the numerical schemes of the fractional diﬀusion equation, we present some nu-
merical results in one and two dimension cases to verify the theoretical results including
the convergence orders and unconditional stability. For the tempered fractional diﬀusion
equation, the numerical simulations are also performed which show the eﬀectiveness of
the proposed scheme; and the desired fourth order convergence is also obtained

Example 1. In this example, we consider the equation (1.1) on space interval [a, b] = [0, 1]
and time interval [0, T ] = [0, 1] with diﬀusion coeﬃcients d+(t) = d+ = 0.8, d−(t) = d− =
0.5, convection coeﬃcient γ(t) = γ = −0.1, initial condition u(x, 0) = x2(1 − x)2, and

The exact solution of this example is u(x, t) = (t2+α + 1)x2(1 − x)2. For the ﬁnite
diﬀerence discretization, the space step and time step are taken to be h = 1/N and
τ = h, respectively. The errors (z = U − u) and convergence order (CO) in the norms
k · k0 and k · kC(¯ωhτ ), where kUkC(¯ωhτ ) = max(xi,tj )∈¯ωhτ |U|, are given in Table 1-2. Here
these notations are used throughout this section.

Example 2. Let us consider the equation (1.1) on space interval [a, b] = [0, 1] and time
interval [0, T ] = [0, 1] with diﬀusion coeﬃcients d+(t) = d+ = 0.5, d−(t) = d− = 0.7,

4 Conclusions

In this paper, the stability and convergence of an implicit diﬀerence schemes approx-
imating the TSFCDE of a general form is studied. Suﬃcient conditions for the uncon-
ditional stability of such diﬀerence schemes are obtained. For proving the stability of a
wide class of diﬀerence schemes approximating the time fractional diﬀusion equation, it
is simple enough to check the stability conditions obtained in this paper. Meanwhile,
the new diﬀerence schemes of the second approximation order in space and the second
approximation order in time for TSFCDEs with variable coeﬃcients (in terms of t) are
constructed as well. The stability and convergence of these schemes in the mesh L2-norm
with the rate equal to the order of the approximation error are proved. The method can
be easily adopted to other TSFCDEs with other boundary conditions. Numerical tests
completely conﬁrming the obtained theoretical results are carried out.

In future work, we will focus on the extension of the proposed implicit diﬀerence scheme
for handling two/three-dimension TSFCDEs subject to various boundary value conditions.
Additionally, the implementation of the implicit diﬀerence scheme (2.12) really requires
the Toeplitz matrix computation, so we also contribute us to build the suitable fast
numerical methods for (2.12) based on Toeplitz matrix properties, see e.g. [15–17, 19, 42]
for a discussion of these issues.
