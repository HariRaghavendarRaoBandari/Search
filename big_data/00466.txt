ABSTRACT
Whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can amplify initially weak magnetic ﬁelds
to dynamically relevant strengths in core collapse supernovae is still a matter of active sci-
entiﬁc debate. Recent numerical studies have shown that, in accordance with the parasitic
model, given the core collapse supernova conditions, the MRI is terminated by parasitic in-
stabilities of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type that disrupt MRI channel ﬂows and quench further
magnetic ﬁeld growth. However, it remains to be properly assessed by what factor the initial
magnetic ﬁeld can be ampliﬁed and how it depends on the initial ﬁeld strength and the am-
plitude of the perturbations. Diﬀerent termination criteria which lead to diﬀerent estimates of
the ampliﬁcation factor were proposed within the parasitic model. To determine the ampliﬁ-
cation factor and test which criterion is a better predictor of the MRI termination, we perform
three-dimensional shearing-disc and shearing-box simulations of a region close to the surface
of a diﬀerentially rotating proto-neutron star in non-ideal MHD with two diﬀerent numeri-
cal codes. We ﬁnd that independently of the initial magnetic ﬁeld strength, the MRI channel
modes can amplify the magnetic ﬁeld by, at most, a factor of 100. Under the conditions found
in proto-neutron stars a more realistic value for the magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation is of the or-
der of 10. This severely limits the role of the MRI channel modes as an agent amplifying the
magnetic ﬁeld in proto-neutron stars starting from small seed ﬁelds.

INTRODUCTION

Originally discovered by Velikhov (1959) and Chandrasekhar
(1960), the magnetorotational instability (MRI) was suggested by
Balbus & Hawley (1991) to be the physical mechanism driving the
redistribution of angular momentum required for the accretion pro-
cess in Keplerian discs orbiting compact objects (see, e.g., Balbus
& Hawley 1998, for a review).

Keplerian discs have a positive radial gradient in angular mo-
mentum, and therefore are linearly (Rayleigh-)stable. Purely hydro-
dynamic perturbations are unlikely to grow to amplitudes at which
the associated stresses can account for eﬃcient angular-momentum
transport. In the presence of a weak magnetic ﬁeld, however, a neg-
ative radial gradient in the angular velocity of the disc is magneto-
rotationally unstable, and seed perturbations can grow exponen-
tially on time scales close to the rotational period. During this
phase, channel modes develop. Channel modes are pairs of coher-
ent radial up- and down-ﬂows stacked vertically and threaded by
layers of magnetic ﬁeld of alternating radial and azimuthal polar-
ity. In these modes, the magnetic tension (Maxwell stress tensor)
c(cid:13) 2016 RAS

transports angular momentum from the inner parts of the disc out-
wards.

The criterion for the MRI onset can be formulated in a rather
simple manner, even if the thermal stratiﬁcation (gradients of en-
tropy or molecular weight) and non-ideal eﬀects (viscosity, resis-
tivity) are included (Balbus 1995; Menou et al. 2004). This allows
for its application beyond Keplerian discs, in particular to proto-
neutron stars (PNS) resulting from the core-collapse of rotating
massive stars. Simpliﬁed simulations by Akiyama et al. (2003)
showed that such PNSs possess regions in which the MRI can
grow on shorter time scales than the time between the bounce and
the successful explosion. This ﬁnding, later conﬁrmed in multi-
dimensional models (e.g. Obergaulinger et al. 2006a; Cerd´a-Dur´an
et al. 2008; Sawai et al. 2013; Sawai & Yamada 2015), presents the
possibility of generating strong magnetic ﬁelds that can tap the ro-
tational energy of the core, power MHD turbulence (Masada et al.
2015), and become a potentially important ingredient in rapidly-
rotating core collapse supernovae (CCSNe).

How much these systems are aﬀected by the MRI crucially
depends on both its growth rate and on the ﬁnal amplitude to which
the seed perturbations grow. We can give an upper limit by assum-

2

Rembiasz et al.

ing that the MRI ceases to grow once the magnetic ﬁeld comes
close to equipartition with the energy of the diﬀerential rotation.
In a CCSN, this would correspond to dynamically important ﬁeld
strengths of ∼ 1015 G (see e.g. Meier et al. 1976; Obergaulinger
et al. 2006a; Cerd´a-Dur´an et al. 2008).

However, this estimate is an upper bound, since it neglects any
eﬀect quenching the MRI before it taps all the available diﬀerential
rotation energy. The physics of the saturation of the MRI growth
remains an active ﬁeld of research with many studies devoted to
ﬁnding the value of the α parameter (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) for
the stress tensor. We refer, among others, to the works of Sano et al.
(2004); Sano & Inutsuka (2001); Brandenburg (2005); Fromang &
Papaloizou (2007); Gardiner & Stone (2005); Knobloch & Julien
(2005).

The model of parasitic instabilities by Goodman & Xu (1994,
GX94 hereafter), further studied and developed by Latter et al.
(2009), Pessah & Goodman (2009, PG09 hereafter) and Pessah
(2010) provides a clear physical picture of the termination mech-
anism. The MRI channel modes are characterised by a shear layer
and a current sheet in the vertical proﬁles of velocity and mag-
netic ﬁeld, respectively. Hence, the (laminar) channel ﬂows can
be unstable against secondary (or parasitic) instabilities of Kelvin-
Helmholtz (KH) or tearing-mode (TM) type.1 Initially, the role of
the parasites is negligible, as they grow much more slowly than the
MRI. However, since the growth rate of the secondary instabilities
is proportional to the channel mode amplitude (which grows expo-
nentially with time), it is clear that at some stage the parasites will
grow faster than the MRI channels (whose growth rate is constant).
Roughly at this point, the parasitic instabilities should disrupt the
channel modes and terminate the MRI growth, marking the transi-
tion to the turbulent saturation phase (PG09).

Pessah (2010) analytically studied the MRI termination in
resistive-viscous MHD by solving simpliﬁed model equations for
the evolution of the parasitic instabilities. He identiﬁed diﬀerent
parameter-space regimes where, depending on hydrodynamic and
magnetic Reynolds numbers, either the KH instability or the TM
is the dominant (i.e. faster developing) secondary instability. In the
regime relevant for CCSNe, the MRI should be terminated by the
KH instability.

Some of the predictions of the parasitic model have been con-
ﬁrmed by Rembiasz et al. (2016a), who performed semi-global
MRI simulations of a PNS following Obergaulinger et al. (2009).
They found, that given the CCSNe conditions, the MRI growth is
indeed terminated by secondary parasitic KH instabilities. More-
over, the properties of these secondary instabilities were in a good
agreement with the parasitic model. As expected, the parasitic in-
stabilities developed along the velocity channels, displaying a very
good agreement of the orientation under which the parasites de-
velop, whereas the wavelength of the parasitic modes was smaller
by a factor of two w.r.t. the theoretical predictions.

Motivated by this good agreement, we test in this paper fur-
ther predictions of the parasitic model, especially those for the
maximum ampliﬁcation of the Maxwell stress by the MRI chan-
nel modes at termination. Two diﬀerent termination criteria were
proposed within the parasitic model (PG09). Depending on the ter-
mination criterion used in their calculations, Latter et al. (2010) and
Pessah (2010) obtained diﬀerent estimates for the maximum mag-
netic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation. So far, these predictions have not been
tested with direct numerical simulations.

1 Latter et al. (2009) classiﬁes the types of parasitic modes diﬀerently.

In order to properly deﬁne the playground in which this pa-
per is written, we should clearly state what we mean by magnetic
ﬁeld ampliﬁcation, since there can be more than a single ampliﬁca-
tion stage. There is a primary magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation resulting
from the exponential ﬁeld growth starting from the initial magnetic
seed and ending when coherent MRI channels are disrupted, the
ﬁeld growth saturates and a turbulent state results. In the turbulent
state, subsequent episodes of (secondary) MRI ampliﬁcation may
be driven, or a turbulent dynamo could be formed. In this work, we
only concentrate on the primary magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation, as a
further discussion of the MRI turbulent state is beyond the scope of
this paper.

In Sec. 2 we describe the initial stage of the MRI during which
channel modes develop. Next, we discuss its termination via the
parasitic instabilities, examining two diﬀerent physical termination
criteria. Finally, we present some estimates for the maximum mag-
netic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation based on the parasitic model. In Sec. 3, we
describe two diﬀerent numerical codes used in our studies and the
initial setup of our 3D simulations. We present the results of these
simulations in Sec. 4, and summarise our ﬁndings in Sec. 5.

We consider ﬂows that can be described by the equations of
resistive-viscous (non-ideal) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In
the presence of an external gravitational potential, Φ, these equa-
tions read

2.2 Magnetorotational instability

We study the MRI in a small portion of the rotating star at a given
distance r from the rotation axis, embedded in a magnetic ﬁeld.
For convenience, we use cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z), hereafter.
We restrict our analysis to locations close to the equatorial plane
(z = 0) and vertical perturbation wavevectors for which the MRI is
known to develop fastest (see, e.g. Balbus & Hawley 1998). In this
case, we can consider a diﬀerentially rotating ﬂuid with angular
frequency Ω and velocity

Balbus & Hawley (1991) investigated the stability of such a
system in the limit of linearised ideal MHD equations, and found
that it is unstable against modes, usually referred to as MRI chan-
nels, which grow exponentially with time. The most unstable MRI
mode is characterised by the vertical wavevector

vc(t) = ˜vceγMRIt,
bc(t) = ˜bceγMRIt,

(15)
(16)

and for brevity, we will often drop the explicit time dependence,
i.e. vc = vc(t) and bc = bc(t). For the fastest-growing mode, the
magnetic ﬁeld and the velocity amplitudes are related by

GX94 showed that MRI modes are exact solutions of the
ideal incompressible MHD equations in the shearing sheet (lo-
cal) approximation. This approximation consists in transforming
the equations to a frame co-rotating with a ﬁducial ﬂuid ele-
ment and linearising the rotational proﬁle around a radius r0, i.e.
Ω(r) ≈ (r − r0)∂rΩ(r)|r0 (for a full description of this approxima-
tion, cf. Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965). Pessah & Chan (2008,
PC08 hereafter) generalised the results of GX94 and showed that
MRI channels (Eqs. 13 and 14) are also exact solutions of the
resistive-viscous incompressible MHD equations in the shearing
sheet approximation. They derived expressions for the growth rate,
the amplitude ratio vc/bc, and the channel angles φv and φb of MRI-
unstable modes for arbitrary hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds

Following PC08 and Rembiasz et al. (2016a), we use the same def-

M¨uller (2015), used a diﬀerent deﬁnition of the Reynolds numbers,
namely,

where Lz is the vertical size of the computational domain. We point
out that assuming Lz = λMRI and q = 1.25, which is the case in all
simulations done with the code Snoopy presented in this paper (see
Sect. 3.1.2), those diﬀerently deﬁned Reynolds numbers are related
by

˜Re = 46Re,
˜Rm = 46Rm.

(22)
(23)

From now on, we will only use Reynolds numbers deﬁned in
Eqs. (18) and (19).

For the Reynolds numbers considered in our studies, i.e.
Re, Rm (cid:62) 100, the characteristics of the fastest-growing MRI mode
(i.e. its growth rate, wavelength, and angles) do not change by more
than ≈ 2% with respect to the ideal MHD case (PC08). We are
therefore going to use Eqs. (11)–(17) in our farther analysis. For a
more detailed discussion of non-ideal eﬀects, we refer the reader to
Rembiasz et al. (2016a).

2.3 MRI termination via parasitic instabilities

GX94 suggested that MRI channels may be unstable against par-
asitic instabilities, which could terminate the MRI growth. They
found in their analytic calculations that in ideal MHD (shear driven)
KH modes can develop on top of MRI channels. GX94 also sug-
gested that in resistive MHD, parasitic instabilities of the (current
driven) TM type could develop, too. Analytical calculations of Lat-
ter et al. (2009) in resistive MHD conﬁrmed this hypothesis. Pessah
(2010) extended these analytical studies to resistive-viscous MHD.
He identiﬁed regions in parameter space, where depending on the
values of the hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds numbers either
KH or TM is the dominant (i.e. faster developing) secondary insta-
bility that terminates MRI growth. In particular, for the conditions
prevailing in CCSNe outside of the neutrinosphere (Re, Rm (cid:29) 1)
the exponential growth phase of the MRI should be terminated by
KH instabilities. This hypothesis was conﬁrmed with direct numer-
ical simulations of Rembiasz et al. (2016a). In the remaining part
of this subsection, we will ﬁrst discuss the basic assumptions of
the parasitic model then, we present some estimates which can be
derived from it. A test of these predictions done with two diﬀerent
numerical codes will be presented in Sec. 4.

To compute the evolution of the parasitic instabilities, GX94
considered perturbations in a system with already well developed
MRI channels given by

v = −qΩ0(r − r0) ˆφ + vc(t) + vp(r, φ, z, t),
b = b0zˆz + bc(t) + bp(r, φ, z, t),

(24)
(25)

4

Rembiasz et al.

where vp and bp are the velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld of the para-
sitic instabilities, respectively. Solving the equations governing the
evolution of the secondary (parasitic) instabilities is a very chal-
lenging task, because MRI channels, which are treated as a back-
ground ﬁeld for the perturbations, are non-stationary. Hence, stan-
dard analytical techniques cannot be used. To make this task more
tractable for analytic studies, GX94 considered a stage of MRI
growth when the amplitude of the MRI channels is much larger
than the initial weak magnetic ﬁeld, i.e. bc (cid:29) b0z. The growth rate
of the secondary instabilities γp (which scales ∝ bc) is then much
larger than the MRI growth rate, i.e. γp (cid:29) γMRI. Under these condi-
tions the time evolution of the MRI channels, the Coriolis force, the
background shear ﬂow, and the initial background magnetic ﬁeld
b0z can be neglected because they act on timescales comparable to
γ−1
MRI. Hence, instead of searching for solutions to perturbations ac-
cording to Eqs. (24) and (25), GX94 considered a simpliﬁed system
where the velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld are given by

v(t) = vc(t0) + vp(r, φ, z, t),
b(t) = bc(t0) + bp(r, φ, z, t),

(26)
(27)

with t0 = const. being the time at which the secondary perturbations
are imposed. The same assumptions were also made in the studies
of Latter et al. (2009), PG09 and Pessah (2010), even though these
authors extrapolated their results to the regime in which γp ∼ γMRI,
in which case neglecting the above mentioned terms is not fully
justiﬁed. Therefore, the analytical results obtained by Latter et al.
(2009) and Pessah (2010) within the parasitic model can probably
be improved, and direct numerical simulations should be used to
test the former theoretical predictions.

In the ideal MHD limit, the dominant parasitic mode is of the
KH type that develops along the MRI velocity channel (the pro-
jection of which in the horizontal plane, forms an angle 45◦ with
respect to the radial direction in the anticlockwise sense) and is
characterised by (e.g. Pessah 2010)

and grows at a rate

kKH = 0.59kMRI

γKH = 0.27kMRIvc.

(28)

(29)

Rembiasz et al. (2016a) observed in their numerical simulations
that for Re, Rm (cid:62) 100 indeed the dominant parasitic modes are of
the KH type and develop along the velocity channels. However, the
wavelength of the parasitic modes was by a factor of two smaller
than theoretically expected. As those authors did not investigate in
detail the source of this discrepancy, the question whether it arises
as a result of the numerics or truly from the underlying physics
remains open.

2.3.1 Termination criteria

Since the MRI growth rate is constant in time (see Eq. (12)) and the
growth rate of the KH instability grows exponentially with time (as
vc ∝ exp(γMRIt)), it is clear that at some point the latter will exceed
the former, i.e. γKH > γMRI. Ultimately, the parasitic instabilities will
therefore start to drain more energy from the MRI channels than the
MRI can feed into them. This should eventually lead to the channel
disruption (GX94).

PG09 proposed that the MRI is terminated at the time, tt, when

γKH(tt) = γMRI

(termination criterion I),

(30)

According to this criterion, by comparing Eq. (29) with Eq. (12)

(and with the help of Eqs. 11 and 17), one can ﬁnd that (indepen-
dently of the value of q)

bc(tt)
b0z

= 3.8.

(31)

PG09 also suggested an alternative termination criterion, i.e.
that it happens when the amplitudes of the MRI channels and para-
sitic modes are comparable, that is

vp(tt) = vc(tt)
bp(tt) = bc(tt)

or

(termination criterion II),

(32)
(33)

where vp and bp are the amplitudes of the parasitic instabilities.
However, they did not investigate this last criterion in more de-
tail analytically, as in this regime the problem becomes non-linear.
Nevertheless, as pointed out by Latter et al. (2010), the termination
criterion II seems to be physically much better justiﬁed. Indeed, at
the stage when parasites grow at an equal rate as the MRI channels,
but the amplitudes of the parasites are much smaller (because they
have been growing at a lower rate than the MRI), they can be still
treated as small terms that can be neglected. Therefore, they should
be of no physical importance and, in particular, should not be able
to quench the MRI growth. Using termination criterion II (and tak-
ing into account the inﬂuence of the background shear in an approx-
imate way), Latter et al. (2010) estimated that the background shear
could increase the termination amplitude to bc(tt)/b0z ∼ 24–40 (de-
pending on the considered amplitude of the parasitic perturbations),
which is a considerably larger value than that estimated using the
termination criterion I (Eq. 31).

Summing up the theoretical estimates, we ﬁnd, on the one
hand, that termination criterion I most probably underestimates the
ampliﬁcation of the magnetic ﬁeld at MRI termination. Neverthe-
less, it may serve as a proxy for termination since, as we shall see
from our numerical models, within 2–3 MRI time scales (i.e. γ−1
MRI)
after the growth rates are equal, the MRI channels will be disrupted
by the parasitic instabilities. On the other hand, in order to use the
termination criterion II, by its own deﬁnition, we should not treat
parasitic perturbations as small, linearising the equations in terms
of them, which makes it diﬃcult to provide analytic estimates with
a more physically adequate condition for MRI termination. This is
why numerical simulations are indispensable to test the predictions
of the parasitic model.

(36)

Hence, from the estimate done by PG09 using the termination cri-
terion I (Eq. 31), we obtain

A = 1.9.

(37)

Next, we want to make some estimates of the MRI termination
amplitude within the parasitic model using the second termination
criterion (Eq. 32). Note that we begin our analysis from the equa-
tions obtained by Pessah (2010) under some simplifying assump-
tions and that we will further introduce additional simpliﬁcations.
Therefore, our estimates must be tested with the simulation results
presented in Sec. 4.

In order to make use of the second termination criterion, we
need to ﬁrst ﬁnd the time evolution of the parasitic KH modes. For
this purpose, we assume that during their whole evolution, i.e. from
their onset until the MRI termination, they can be factored in the
following terms

vKH(r, θ, z, t) = vKH(t)fKH(r, θ, z),

(38)

where vKH(t) is the instability amplitude and includes the time evo-
lution of the perturbation, and fKH is a normalised function (i.e.
max(fKH) = 1) that does not depend on time (its explicit form can
be found in Pessah 2010). Note that the factorisation assumed in
Eq. (38) may fail because, among other reasons, (i) we neglect ef-
fects proportional to Ω (the shear and the Coriolis force), and (ii)
because shortly before the MRI termination, when vKH ≈ vc, the
KH instability will enter the non-linear phase of its evolution. In
this phase the KH perturbations eventually become comparable to
the background shear, and the growth of the instability is reduced
before its ﬁnal termination (cf. Keppens et al. 1999; Obergaulinger
et al. 2010).

We can ﬁnd the time evolution of vKH(t) from the deﬁnition of

the KH instability growth rate, i.e.

γKH(t) ≡ ˙vKH(t)
vKH(t) ,

(39)

provided that γKH(t) is known. The resulting diﬀerential equation
can be integrated analytically if we assume γKH(t) = σkMRIvc(t),
where σ = const.2, that is (see Latter 2016, for a similar calculation
on a diﬀerent primary instability)

where t0 is the time at which the KH perturbations begin to grow.

Now, we can determine the MRI termination amplitude from

the condition

(42)

where for s = 1, we recover the termination criterion II exactly,
but we allow this parameter to slightly vary, as the choice s = 1
is somewhat arbitrary. With the help of Eqs. (15) and (41), we can
rewrite the above condition as

where the term on the LHS of Eq. (43) is equal to the deﬁnition of
the velocity amplitude at termination vc(tt) (see, Eq. 15).

We note that Eq. (43) should be treated as an equation for tt.
There is a trivial solution, tt = 0, for ˜vKH = s˜vc. However, these
are not physically plausible initial conditions. For the MRI chan-
nels to be destroyed by the KH instability, they should exist in the
ﬁrst place. So even if we start with completely random initial per-
turbations (which is physically plausible), we ﬁrst expect the MRI
channels to develop, implying that tt > 0. Then, after a suﬃciently
developed velocity shear sets in between the channels, the parts
of the initial perturbations which do not promote the growth of the
MRI will seed the growth of the KH instabilities. In practical terms,
this means that we can safely assume that ˜vKH < s˜vc (s (cid:46) 1). From
Eqs. (17) and (36), we ﬁnd

Since, typically ˜vc/cAz (cid:28) 1 and cAz/˜vKH (cid:29) 1, the ampliﬁcation
factor should be almost independent of the initial MRI channel am-
plitude and depend logarithmically on the ratio of the initial ve-
locity amplitude of the parasitic instabilities to the amplitude of
the background Alfv´en speed (or, equivalently, the initial magnetic
ﬁeld strength). For σ = 0.27 (the value calculated by PG09), s = 1
and cAz/˜vKH = 1000 (a typical value used in our simulations), we
obtain

A (cid:39) 19.

(48)

Finally, we discuss the results of Latter et al. (2010) who
gave an approximate description of the inﬂuence of the background
shear on the development of the parasitic instabilities. They pointed
out that due to shear, the radial wavenumber of non-axisymmetric
parasitic modes increases linearly with time while the azimuthal
wavenumber remains unchanged. As a consequence, during most
of its evolution, the parasitic mode is expected to grow at a rate
smaller than that predicted by GX94, since its wavelength and ori-
entation w.r.t. the velocity channel is not optimal. Moreover, the
parasitic mode can only grow for a limited time τ before the shear
prevents its further growth completely. Latter et al. (2010) found
that the dominant mode would have at most a time of

τ =

2.18
qΩ

(49)

for its development. Furthermore, they roughly estimated that the
growth rate of the mode is reduced by a factor of two as a result of
the shear, i.e.

γKH(t) =

Rembiasz et al.

and calculated the MRI termination amplitude, from the condition
(42) assuming that parasitic perturbations are introduced at t = t0 (cid:44)
0 and that τ = tt − t0. If within the time interval τ, condition (42)
is not met, the MRI will not be terminated. Hence, these authors
determined the minimum amplitude of the velocity perturbations
vc(t0) for which the parasitic modes can catch up with the MRI
channels after the aforementioned time interval τ has passed. When
calculating the growth rate of the parasitic instabilities, Latter et
al. (2010) further neglected the fact that within the time interval τ
the parasitic growth rate increases as the MRI channel amplitude
increases with time. They thus obtain

vKH(t) = vKH(t0) exp

In order to make a further progress with this equation, we have to

growth of the parasitic instabilities from time t = 0 to t = t0 is
negligible, i.e. vKH(t0) ≈ vKH(0) = ˜vKH, which is well justiﬁed in the
light of our simulations done with Snoopy (see Fig. 4.1.2 of model
#S19 discussed in Sec. 2), we ﬁnally obtain

This equation has a very similar form to Eq. 47, but predicts larger

Note, however, that as in Latter et al. (2010), it was assumed that
bc(tt) ≈ bc(t0), i.e. the growth of the magnetic ﬁeld in the time inter-
val τ was neglected. Taking this eﬀect into account would increase
the estimate of A by another factor of exp (γMRIτ) (cid:39) 3, i.e.

3 NUMERICAL SETUP

To test the predictions of the parasitic model, we perform simu-
lations using two diﬀerent numerical codes, a ﬁnite-volume code,
Aenus, and a pseudo-spectral code, Snoopy, that we describe brieﬂy
in the following subsections. The advantages and disadvantaged of
the simulations performed with these codes will be discussed in
Sec. 4.

3.1 Numerical codes

3.1.1 Aenus

We use the three-dimensional Eulerian MHD code Aenus (Ober-
gaulinger 2008) to solve the MHD equations (1)–(5). The code
is based on a ﬂux-conservative, ﬁnite-volume formulation of the
MHD equations and the constrained-transport scheme to main-
tain a divergence-free magnetic ﬁeld (Evans & Hawley 1988).
The code is based on high-resolution shock-capturing methods

(e.g. LeVeque 1992). It implements various optional high-order
reconstruction algorithms, including a total-variation-diminishing
piecewise-linear (TVD-PL) reconstruction of second-order ac-
curacy, a third-, ﬁfth-, seventh- and ninth-order monotonicity-
preserving (MP3, MP5, MP7 and MP9, respectively) scheme
(Suresh & Huynh 1997), a fourth-order, weighted, essentially non-
oscillatory (WENO4) scheme (Levy et al. 2002), and approximate
Riemann solvers based on the multi-stage (MUSTA) method (Toro
& Titarev 2006). We add terms including viscosity and resistivity
to the ﬂux terms in the Euler equations and to the electric ﬁeld
in the MHD induction equation. We treat these terms similarly to
the ﬂuxes and electric ﬁelds of ideal MHD. The derivatives of ve-
locity and magnetic ﬁeld appearing in the viscous ﬂuxes and re-
sistive electric ﬁeld, respectively, are computed from reconstructed
states obtained by same high-order reconstruction methods as for
the terms of ideal MHD. The explicit time integration can be done
with Runge-Kutta schemes of ﬁrst, second, third, and fourth order
(RK1, RK2, RK3, and RK4), respectively.

We performed the simulations reported here with the MP9
scheme, a MUSTA solver based on the HLLD Riemann solver, and
an RK3 time integrator (Harten 1983; Miyoshi & Kusano 2005).
See Rembiasz et al. (2016a) for a justiﬁcation of this choice.

3.1.2

Snoopy

We use the pseudo-spectral code Snoopy (Lesur & Longaretti 2005,
2007) to solve the MHD equations (1)–(5) in the shearing box
and incompressible approximations. The incompressible approxi-
mation holds if both the ﬂow and Alfv´en velocities are much less
than the sound speed. It further assumes a uniform background den-
sity ρ0 and entropy, i.e. one neglects the radial density and entropy
gradients. The incompressible approximation can be considered a
special case of the Boussinesq approximation (when the entropy
gradient vanishes), whose validity in the CCSN conditions has been
extensively discussed in Guilet & M¨uller (2015). Snoopy solves the
3D shearing box equations using a spectral Fourier method, where
the shear is handled through the use of a shearing wave decompo-
sition (with time varying radial wavevector) and a periodic remap
procedure. Nonlinear terms are computed with a pseudo-spectral
method using the 2/3 dealiasing rule. The time integration is per-
formed using an implicit procedure for the diﬀusive terms, while
other terms use an explicit 3rd order Runge Kutta scheme. Snoopy
is parallelised using both MPI and OpenMP techniques. It has been
extensively used in the past to study the MRI in the context of ac-
cretion discs (Lesur & Longaretti 2007; Longaretti & Lesur 2010;
Rempel et al. 2010; Lesur & Longaretti 2011; Meheut et al. 2015;
Walker et al. 2015) and PNSs (Guilet & M¨uller 2015).

3.1.3

Initial conditions

In the simulations performed with Aenus, following Rembiasz et
al. (2016a) and Obergaulinger et al. (2009), we use equilibrium
initial conditions based on the ﬁnal stages of post-bounce cores
from Obergaulinger et al. (2006b), in which (several tens of mil-
liseconds after core bounce) the shock wave has reached distances
of a few hundred kilometers and the post-shock region exhibits a
series of damped oscillations as the PNS relaxes into a nearly hy-
drostatic conﬁguration. The rotational proﬁle (given by Eq. 9 with
Ω0 = 767 s−1, and q = 1.25) that we used in our simulations, is
similar to the one employed in the global MRI simulations of Ober-
gaulinger et al. (2006b). Because the resulting centrifugal force is
c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–19

insuﬃcient to balance gravity, the gas is kept in (an initial hydro-
dynamic) equilibrium by an additional pressure gradient, so that

ρ∂rΦ − ∂rP + rρΩ2 = 0.

(57)

The initial distributions of angular velocity, density, and gravita-
tional potential were obtained by rescaling those used by Rembiasz
et al. (2016a, Fig. 1) to match the conditions encountered at the
PNS surface (see Appendix A for more details).

At this location, neutrinos do not have a strong impact on
the dynamics (Guilet et al. 2015) and we therefore expect a very
small viscosity. In all Aenus simulations (see Tab. 1), we set the
shear and bulk viscosity to ν = ξ = 0 cm2 s−1, and the value
of resistivity was chosen so that the magnetic Reynolds number
Rm = 100. Therefore, if we consider, e.g. an initial magnetic ﬁeld
strength b0z = 1.22 × 1013 G, the previous value of Rm corresponds
to η = 7.48 × 108 cm2 s−1. The typical simulation domain was set
to Lr × Lφ × Lz = 2 km × 2 km × λMRI, except for the models #A7,
#A8a,b,c, #A11, in which Lr × Lφ × Lz = 2 km× 8 km× 3λMRI. Note
however, that both Rm and λMRI are not constant in the computa-
tional domain but vary by some ≈ 20% (see Rembiasz et al. 2016a,
for details).

We assume periodic boundary conditions in the directions φ
and z. In the radial direction, we use shearing disc boundary condi-
tions (Klahr & Bodenheimer 2003), i.e. we apply periodic bound-
ary conditions to the deviation of several variables from their initial
state. For instance, applied to the ﬂuid density we have that such
deviation is

δρ(r, t) ≡ ρ(r, t) − ρ(r, 0),

(58)

and we enforce shear-periodicity of the variables δρ(r, t) (see Rem-
biasz et al. 2016a, for a more detailed justiﬁcation of this choice).
We apply these boundary conditions to angular velocity, density,
momentum, and entropy. Because the initial magnetic ﬁeld is ho-
mogeneous in all our simulations, we use periodic boundary condi-
tions for this quantity too.

In all Snoopy simulations (see Tab. 2), we use analogous ini-
tial conditions with the exceptions that simulations are done in the
frame corotationg with the ﬂuid and the rotational proﬁle is lin-
earised (shearing box approximation). Moreover, the background
density is uniform and set to ρ0 = 2.47 × 1012 g cm−3 (which cor-
responds to the central value in Aenus simulations), and the shear
viscosity and resistivity are chosen so that Re = Rm = 100.

In the simulations done with Aenus, following Rembiasz et al.
(2016a), to trigger the MRI we impose an initial velocity pertur-
bation on the background velocity proﬁle (deﬁned by Eq. 7) of the
form

v1 = Ωr(cid:2){δrRr(r, φ, z) +  sin(kzz)}ˆr+
δRφ(r, φ, z) ˆφ + δRz(r, φ, z)ˆz(cid:3),

(59)

where Rr(r, φ, z), Rφ(r, φ, z), and Rz(r, φ, z) are random numbers in
the range [−1, 1], δ and δr are the perturbation amplitudes, kz is
the vertical perturbation wavenumber, and  is the amplitude of the
sinusoidal perturbation in the z-direction. We choose δr = 0.1δ.
Typically,  and δ are of the order of 10−5. Their exact values in
each simulation can be found in Tab. 1. In all simulations we set
kz = kMRI, with the only exception being model #A9b in which
kz = 3kMRI. Even though we initialise the channel only in one ve-
locity component instead of both radial and azimuthal components
of velocity and magnetic ﬁeld, the other components quickly grow
and form a fully developed channel mode.

In Snoopy simulations, we use ﬁve diﬀerent prescriptions for

the initial perturbations. In simulations #S1a–#S18 from Tab. 2, to
the background velocity, v0 = −qΩ0(r − r0) ˆφ, we added “one com-
ponent of an MRI channel”, i.e.

where β ∈ {r, φ, z}, kβ = 2π l/Lβ, Rlmn and χlmn are random ampli-
tude and phase of a given mode. The sum is restricted to Fourier
modes with wavelength longer than 0.1 km. The amplitudes Rlmn
√
are random numbers between 0 and δΩ0r0/
npert, where npert is
the number of excited modes. The solenoidal nature of the veloc-
ity ﬁeld in the incompressible approximation is enforced a poste-
riori by subtracting the divergence part of the ﬁeld. Random mag-
netic ﬁeld perturbations b1 are constructed in an analogous way, the
Alfv´en velocity replacing the velocity in the equations. Hence the
ﬁnal form of the initial velocity and magnetic ﬁeld is

β

v = −qΩ0(r − r0) ˆφ + v + ˜v1,
b = b0zˆz + b1.

(62)
(63)

The values of δ and  in each simulation can be found in Tab. 2. The
perturbations in simulations #S19 follow from the same procedure
except that all wavelengths down to the grid scale are perturbed.
In simulations #SA15a–e from Tab. 2 the random velocity pertur-
bations ˜v1 are replaced by cell-by-cell random values in the range
[−δr0Ω0, δr0Ω0] for each velocity component, while the magnetic
ﬁeld perturbations vanish ˜b1 = 0.

In simulations #SCA15a–#SCA16c and #SCR15a–c from

Tab. 4, the initial velocity and magnetic ﬁeld are given by

v = −qΩ0(r − r0) ˆφ + vc + ˜v1,
b = b0zˆz + bc + b1,

(64)
(65)
where vc and bc are the full channel mode solution given by
Eqs. (13) and (14), respectively, and ˜vc = Ω0r0 and ˜bc is deter-
mined from Eq. (17). In simulations #SCR15a–c random perturba-
tions ˜v1 and ˜b1 follow equation (61) as explained above, whereas in
simulations #SCA15a–#SCA16c they are replaced by cell-by-cell
random values for the velocity and zero magnetic ﬁeld perturbation.

4 RESULTS
4.1 Termination criterion

The goal of this section is to determine which termination crite-
rion (I or II, Eqs. 30 and 32, respectively) is a better predictor for
the MRI termination. To this end, we analyse in detail simulations
#A8a (which was also presented in Rembiasz et al. 2016a, as model
#7, see Appendix A, for details) and #S19 performed with Aenus
and Snoopy, respectively.

We have calculated spatial discrete 3D Fourier transforms of the
ρv components bβ, vβ, and wβ,

Transform (FFT) algorithm. We denote the complex FFT coeﬃ-
cients with ˆbβ, ˆvβ and ˆwβ, respectively. The power spectral density
of the magnetic ﬁeld is proportional to |ˆbβ|2, which is a measure of
the average magnetic ﬁeld energy density of the component bβ in

tional to | ˆwβ|2. We expect that MRI channel ﬂows appear as struc-
tures with a wavevector

and the parasitic instabilities develop with non-zero radial and az-
imuthal wavenumbers.

To determine the horizontal component of the wavevector of
the parasitic instabilities, Rembiasz et al. (2016a) analysed Fourier
modes of bα with ﬁnite kr and kφ, but kz = 0. They found that
the parasitic instabilities produce a characteristic signature with
wavevectors kp = (kr, kφ, 0), where kr (cid:39) kφ (cid:39) 0.8kMRI. This means
that in accordance with the parasitic model, parasitic instabilities
develop along the velocity channels.

In this paper, we want to ﬁnd an estimator for the total mag-
netic and kinetic energy stored in the parasitic instabilities. It is
clear however, that the parasites will also contribute to other Fourier
modes. For instance, according to Pessah (2010), the dominant
parasitic mode will contribute to all Fourier modes with kp =
(ζkMRI, ζkMRI, nkMRI), where ζ = 0.42 and n is a natural number.
However, we expect to see not only the dominant modes in our
simulations. Moreover, as pointed out by Latter et al. (2010), PG09
and Pessah (2010) the rotational shear will modify the horizontal
components of the parasitic modes (making them time dependent).

as an estimator for the energy stored in parasitic modes, i.e. we
take all Fourier modes but the axisymmetric ones. We exclude
the axisymmetric modes because they not only include the MRI
channels, but also contributions due to: (i) ˆwφ−modes arising from
the background diﬀerential rotation; (ii) radial ( ˆwr−) modes possi-
bly excited by (small) deviations from hydrodynamical equilibrium
caused by the numerical inaccuracies; (iii) modes driven by the ra-
dial boundary conditions.

Figure 1 (upper panels) shows the time evolution of the mag-
netic and kinetic energy density for both the MRI and the parasitic
instabilities (given by Eqs. 70–73; see Fig. 2 for the corresponding
results of a Snoopy simulation). The MRI (Fourier) modes grow ex-
ponentially with time at a constant rate from t ≈ 8 ms to t ≈ 24 ms.
The average magnetic and kinetic energy density emag
p,α, re-
spectively, of the parasites begin to grow super-exponentially at
t ≈ 20 ms from a value of about 6 orders of magnitude smaller
than that of the MRI. According to termination criterion I, the MRI
termination should occur already at t ≈ 21 ms (see bottom panels of
Fig. 1) however, we observe that the MRI keeps growing for ∼ 5 ms

longer. Indeed, the termination criterion II provides a better proxy
for the actual termination of the MRI growth. As it can be seen
from the upper panels of Fig. 1, the actual termination happens a
bit before the amplitude of the parasitic modes equals that of the
MRI ones, when the parasitic amplitudes become about half of the
MRI amplitudes. As we have mentioned before, termination crite-
rion I should only be treated as an indicator that once it is fulﬁlled,
the MRI termination will happen shortly (i.e. after a time of the
order of a few MRI time scales) afterwards.

Having ruled out one of the proposed termination criteria, we
will now investigate the other criterion in more detail. The most
striking feature of the end of the MRI is the maximum of Mrφ
(deﬁned in Eq. 34). However, the total Maxwell stress may con-
tain non-negligible contributions of the parasites and not only of
the MRI channels and, thus, its maximum does not necessarily cor-
respond to the maximum amplitude of the MRI channels. Hence,
it would be better to deﬁne the MRI termination as the point at
which the amplitudes of the Fourier modes related to the MRI (Eq.
70) reach their maximum. The diﬀerence, however, turns out to be
minor in Aenus simulations. For simulation #A8a, we were able
to compare the two deﬁnitions. We ﬁnd comparable termination
times of t = 26.3 ms (maximum of channel Fourier modes) and
t = 26.7 ms (maximum of Mrφ). Consequently, termination is de-
layed w.r.t. the prediction of criterion I by a time of ∼ 2.7γ−1
MRI.
Note, however, the contamination introduced by our boundary con-
ditions can somewhat reduce the time between when the termina-
tion criterion I is fulﬁlled and the MRI termination (see also Sec.
4.1.2, where we discuss an analogous simulation done with Snoopy,
where this time is closer to ≈ 3γ−1
MRI).

In the following, we want to assess the quality of the numer-
ical results obtained with Aenus. For that, we note that the domi-
nant axisymmetric MRI modes (with a vanishing radial component
of the wavevector) do not amplify the vz component of the veloc-
ity. Hence, we could tentatively use this component as a tracer of
the parasitic instabilities if no other (numerical) eﬀects drive the

growth of vz. If we deﬁne

should in principle be equal to the growth rate of the parasitic in-
stabilities (provided there are no other eﬀects aﬀecting vz). In the
upper panel of Fig. 3 we provide a comparison between the time
evolution of γz and that of the MRI growth rate computed from the
box-integrated vz component of the velocity ﬁeld.3 It is evident that
γz follows quite closely the evolution of γMRI, specially in the time
interval between t ≈ 12 ms and t ≈ 21 ms, instead of tracing the
evolution of the growth rate of the parasitic instabilities (compare
Fig. 3 upper panel with the lower right panel of Fig. 1). Hence, the
z until t ≈ 21 ms, cannot be caused (only) by parasitic
growth of ekin
instabilities. Indeed, Rembiasz (2013) observed a very similar be-
haviour of ekin
in his 2D and 3D MRI simulations (see Figs. 4.13
z
and 4.14 therein), which hints that ekin
is ampliﬁed by an axisym-
z
metric phenomenon (diﬀerent from the dominant MRI axisymmet-
ric modes).

This growth of ekin
z

can be explained by the following rea-
sons. Firstly, as MRI magnetic channels grow, they will generate
a non-uniform magnetic pressure accelerating ﬂuid in the vertical
direction (towards magnetic null surfaces of the MRI channels, cf.
GX94). Secondly, the initially purely radial proﬁle of the gas pres-
sure will acquire a vertical gradient due to the advective transport
of internal energy in the up- and down-ﬂows of the channel modes.
This in turn will create pressure gradients in the vertical direction

3 Note the diﬀerence with the value of the MRI growth rate shown in Fig. 1,
which is computed from the Fourier transformed vz component.

and hence vertical ﬂuid motions to redistribute the pressure and
equilibrate the system. Thirdly, this vertical motions could be re-
lated to the radial boundary conditions. The MRI growth rate is
not constant in the whole computational domain, as γMRI ∝ Ω(r).
This means that the amplitude of the channel modes will grow at a
higher rate at r = 30 km than at r = 32 km. Consequently, once the
MRI channels are formed, there is a shear at the radial boundaries
where we use periodic boundary conditions for the perturbations.
This shear introduces some perturbations to all velocity and mag-
netic ﬁeld components, whose inﬂuence can be best observed in the

vz velocity component as it should not be aﬀected by the dominant
MRI mode. During the exponential growth phase, the amplitude of
vz is proportional to the amplitude of the MRI channels, vc, so that,
|vz| ≈ 0.15vc.

A comparison of the upper panel of Fig. 3 with an analogous
plot for simulation #S19 (discussed in more detail in Sec. 4.1.2)
done with Snoopy (bottom panel of Fig. 3) provides another argu-
ment supporting our hypothesis that those axisymmetric vertical
motions are mostly of the numerical origin. In the Snoopy simula-
tion, the growth of the vertical motions, quantitatively indicated by

γz, from t ≈ 12 ms–17 ms is triggered by a subdominant axisym-
metric MRI mode with a non-zero radial component. Note that γz
becomes comparable to γMRI only when the genuine parasitic insta-
bilities start to grow superexponentially.

However, as much as part of those vertical motions in the
Aenus simulation is clearly of a numerical origin, we should not
be concerned too much with that. Even though these axisymmetric
modes are dominant ’non-MRI’ modes before real parasitic insta-
bilities appear, they do not cause the MRI termination. In spite of
the fact that the amplitude of these artiﬁcial modes is some 15% of
the channel modes, the MRI can grow unaﬀected by them.

This can be clearly again seen with the help of Fourier analysis
(see the upper panel of Fig. 4) . Until t = 23.8 ms, the axisymmet-
ric modes of vz account for 99% of the kinetic energy stored in the

vz component. However, once the parasitic instabilities appear and
start to contribute to this component, the fraction of the axisymmet-
ric modes vz drops signiﬁcantly and very rapidly. At t = 25.6 ms,
the contribution of axisymmetric modes to ekin
is 86%, and only
z
half a millisecond later, i.e. at t = 26.2 ms, 16%. At the MRI termi-
nation, i.e. t = 26.7 ms, the total contribution of the axisymmetric
modes is only 2.5%. This clearly demonstrates that those modes do
not play a decisive role in the MRI termination and that the insta-
bility is terminated by genuine non-axisymmetric parasitic modes.
Another diﬀerence between the Aenus and Snoopy simula-
tions is that in the former, non-axisymmetric ˆbα and ˆwα modes grow
from the beginning of the simulation, thought until t ≈ 21 ms at a
rate lower than γMRI (upper panels of Fig. 1), whereas in the latter,
these modes basically do not grow until t ≈ 25 ms (upper panels

before the termination (bottom panel of Fig. 4). From this panel,
we can see that the non-axisymetric part of the velocity compo-
nent vz is highest close to the radial boundaries. This suggest that
radial boundary conditions are (most likely) responsible for trig-
gering this component. However, only when the growth rate of the
genuine parasitic modes is high enough, the parasitic modes can use
those artiﬁcial modes as their initial perturbations. At later stages
(and at the termination), the non-axisymmetric modes are not lo-
calised at the radial boundaries.

4.1.2

Snoopy simulation

We repeat an analogous analysis of simulation #S19 done with
Snoopy. Figure 2 shows the time evolution of the magnetic and ki-
netic energy density for both the MRI and the parasitic instabilities
(given by Eqs. 70–73). The MRI (Fourier) modes grow exponen-
tially with time at a constant rate from t ≈ 8 ms to t ≈ 27 ms.
The amplitude of parasitic instabilities is constant in the ﬁrst 25 ms
and then experiences a fast growth. Like in the Aenus simulation,
the parasitic instabilities growth rate increases with the MRI am-
plitude in agreement with theoretical expectations. An interesting
feature that appears in the Snoopy simulation is that the growth rate
of the parasitic modes shows oscillations with time with a period
τ ≈ 2–3 ms (bottom panels of Fig. 2). These oscillations could be
caused by shear, as argued by Latter et al. (2010). A parasitic mode
wavevector has the optimal orientation only for a limited time be-
fore its radial component becomes too large for an eﬃcient growth.
Note that according to Eq. (49), we would expect in this simulation
τ = 2.27 ms, which agrees very well with the observed period of
the oscillations. This seems to hint that any future parasitic model
should take the inﬂuence of the shear into account, as its inﬂuence
on the parasitic modes is non-negligible.

The average magnetic and kinetic energy density emag

p,α and ekin
p,α,
respectively, of the parasites begin to grow super-exponentially at
t ≈ 25 ms from a value of about 10 orders of magnitude smaller
than that of the MRI. The Maxwell stress Mrφ assumes its maxi-
mum at tt2 = 28.9 ms, and then the MRI growth is terminated and
the channels are disrupted. The alternative deﬁnition of the moment
of termination via the maximum of the Fourier modes of the chan-
nels, leads to very slightly earlier termination time of tt1 = 28.8 ms.
We can conclude that both termination deﬁnitions are consis-
tent within 0.1 ms with the amplitude of the parasitic instabilities
being equal to the MRI amplitude (termination criterion II) but are
clearly inconsistent with criterion I. Parasitic instabilities reach the
growth rate of the MRI at t ≈ 23 ms, but the termination happens
only ≈ 6 ms ≈ 3γ−1

MRI later.

4.2 Ampliﬁcation factor

4.2.1 Dependence on the initial perturbations in Aenus

The boundary conditions used in simulations performed with
Aenus do aﬀect the exact value of the ampliﬁcation factor and its
dependence on the initial parasitic perturbations. Intuitively, one
would expect (somewhat) larger ampliﬁcation factor for smaller
initial parasitic perturbations (see also Eqs. 47 and 54). However,
independently of the initial perturbations, non-axisymmetric per-
turbations introduced by our radial boundary conditions can be

Figure 3. Top: Growth rate of the MRI (black line) and growth rate of the
kinetic energy density in the vertical direction (dash-dotted line; Eq. 75)
in Aenus simulation #A8a. Note that to properly compare both growth
rates, the MRI growth rate is computed from the time evolution of the
volume-averaged Maxwell stress (Eq. 34), instead of from the correspond-
ing Fourier modes (as done in Fig. 1). The vertical green line marks the time
at which the bottom snapshot of Fig. 4 is taken. Bottom: Same as the upper
panel but for the Snoopy simulation #S19.

of Fig. 2). This suggest that in the Aenus simulation, radial bound-
ary conditions introduce also some non-axisymmetric perturbations
(which in turn could be used as seed perturbations for genuine non-
axisymmetric parasitic modes). To test this hypothesis, we compute
the vertically and azimuthally averaged RMS amplitude of the non-
axisymmetric part of the velocity component vz, i.e.

criterion). The only diﬀerence between these two simulations was,
that in the latter an MRI channel was formed a few milliseconds
later and MRI was terminated ∼ 10 ms later. However, the ampliﬁ-
cation factor was basically not aﬀected (A = 21.0 and A = 20.0,
respectively). A more detailed discussion of this simulation can be
found in Rembiasz (2013).

In spite of the boundary conditions used in Aenus simulations,
we could say that because of the fact that due to these artiﬁcial non-
axisymmetric perturbations, the ampliﬁcation factor does not have
any random scatter, this has the upside that we could perform con-
vergence studies. On the other hand, in order to reliably assess the
dependence of the ampliﬁcation factor on the initial perturbations,
we have validated the Aenus results by employing a completely dif-
ferent code, Snoopy, where the boundary conditions are much easy
to handle (though under the restrictions of applicability spelled out
in Sect. 3.1.2).

4.2.2 Dependence on the initial perturbations in Snoopy

To test the dependence on the amplitude of the initial random
perturbations, which are mainly a seed for KH parasitic instabil-
ities, i.e. parameter δ in Eq. (59), we ran simulations #S15a–#S15d
and #S16a–#S16d with the same initial magnetic ﬁeld strength
b0z = 1.18 × 1013 G in all models, but with two diﬀerent resolu-
tions and varying amplitudes of the initial perturbations in the range
δ = (0.1–1) × 10−5 (upper panel of Fig. 5). We note that the models
#S15c and #S15d have the same initialisation but, because of the
stochastic nature of the initial perturbations they are run to assess
the scatter of the ﬁnal results as a function of the initial random-
ness imposed by the perturbations parametrised with the amplitude
δ. The same comment applies to models #S16c and #S16d. The am-
pliﬁcation factor is in the range A (cid:39) 60–110, which is by a factor
∼ 3–5 larger than in Aenus simulations.

In order to test the inﬂuence of the initial channel ampli-
tude on the ampliﬁcation factor, we consider the sets of models
#S15c–#S15h and #S16c–#S16h. Both sets diﬀer in resolution and
within each set we vary the initial channel amplitude in the range
 = (0.2–20) × 10−5 (bottom panel of Fig. 5). We see a logarithmic
dependence of the ampliﬁcation factor on the amplitudes of both
the initial perturbations and of the channel modes. To these simu-
lation results we ﬁtted a function

A(, δ) = a ln  + d ln δ + C,

(78)
obtaining a = 5.4±0.55, d = −20.2±1.2, and C = −101±13. Now,
we can compare these results with two diﬀerent theoretical predic-
tions for the ampliﬁcation factor given by Eqs. (47) and (54). If we
assume that ˜vKH ∝ δ, σ = 0.27, and lnA ≈ const. in this parameter
range, from Eq. (47), we would theoretically expect d = −1.85. We
obtain a discrepancy of one order of magnitude. When calculating
the parasitic growth rate (Eq. 29), PG09 neglected the inﬂuence of
the background shear (and of the Coriolis force) which, as pointed
out by Latter et al. (2010) can lead to a reduction of the growth rate.
Taking this eﬀect into account in an approximate way, Eq. (54) pre-
dicts d = −3.41. Moreover, taking into account the growth of the
magnetic ﬁeld in the time interval τ by a factor of ≈ 3 (see the dis-
cussion below Eq. 54), would lead to d = −10.1, which is closer
to the simulation results. This discrepancy could be caused by the
extrapolation of Eq. (29) to the non-linear regime of the KH insta-
bility, where we, however, expect a growth rate reduction. Taking
all these eﬀects into account, we could expect a signiﬁcant growth
rate reduction. Note that from the ﬁt we could estimate that the ef-
fective value of σ is σeﬀ = 0.0125, i.e. the KH growth rate should

used by parasitic instabilities as their seed perturbations. These can
be seen when comparing the ampliﬁcation factor of simulations
#A8a, #A8b, #A8c, which are done with the same initial condi-
tions (physical and numerical) but diﬀerent realisations of random
initial perturbations with the same normalisation δ. However, the
ampliﬁcation factor is basically the same in all three simulations,
i.e. A (cid:39) 21.

This fact can be seen even more clearly when comparing sim-
ulations #A9a and #A9b. In the former, we used standard initial
perturbations, whereas in the latter we put kz = 3kMRI (see Eq. 59),
i.e. we perturbed the system with a mode that should be stable
against MRI (cf. PC08, Rembiasz et al. 2016a, for the instability

function of the velocity of the MRI channels. However, exploring
modiﬁcations of the parasitic model theory that include such kind
of non-linearities is beyond the scope of this paper.
To study the dependence of the ampliﬁcation factor on the ini-
tial channel amplitude, if we asume that ˜vc ∝ , σ = 0.27, and again
lnA ≈ const. from Eqs. (47) and (54) , we would theoretically ex-
pect a = 0, i.e. the ampliﬁcation factor should be independent of
 (note that we neglected the last term in the RHS of Eq. (47), as
(cid:28) 1 in our simulations). Thus, we conclude that present pre-
˜vc
cAz
dictions within the parasitic instability model fail to predict this
dependence correctly.

To test the dependence of the ampliﬁcation factor not only on
the amplitude of the initial perturbations but also their form, we
ran simulations #SA15a-e obtaining A ≈ 90, which is somewhat
higher than for the corresponding simulations #S15c–d for which
A ≈ 60. Taking into account that the MRI termination is a highly
non-linear process, we conclude that there is some, but not very
strong dependence.

Finally, it is worthwhile comparing predictions given by two
diﬀerent numerical codes for similar initial conditions. In the best
resolved Aenus simulations with b0z = 1.22 × 1013 G, i.e. mod-
els #A10 and #A11, we obtained A ≈ 19, which is a considerably
smaller value than in analogous Snoopy simulations, i.e. models
#S15a–e (with b0z = 1.22 × 1013 G) in which A ≈ 90. This diﬀer-
ence can be probably attributed to the following facts. Firstly, com-
pressibility (not included in Snoopy simulation) may play a certain
role in the termination process itself, providing another way of ex-
tracting energy from the MRI channels (and converting it into in-
ternal energy). Secondly, the imperfect radial boundary conditions
continuously pollute the numerical data on the grid (see the bottom
panel of Fig. 4). These perturbations of both physical and numer-
ical origin can act as seed perturbations for the parasitic instabili-
ties. For Aenus, they seem to dominate the initial random pertur-
bations of amplitude δ, which therefore are completely insigniﬁ-
cant in comparison. Consequently, the termination of the MRI is
decoupled from the parameter δ. Comparing the upper panels of
Figures 1 and 2, we see that in the Aenus simulations, the non-
axisymmetric perturbations grow from 5 to 20 ms, whereas they re-
main roughly constant in the Snoopy simulations. At t ≈ 20 ms, the
non-axisymmetric perturbations in model #A8a start to grow super-
exponentially with time, which can be attributed to the genuine par-
asitic instabilities. Therefore, we could equally well start this sim-
ulation at t ≈ 20 ms with MRI channels determined by  ≈ 10−2
and random perturbations of roughly δ ≈ 10−3. For these parame-
ters, Eq. (78) yields an ampliﬁcation factor A(Aenus) = 14 ± 24,
which is compatible with the value measured in the simulation, i.e.
A = 18.6 (for the amplitudes used in the actual simulation, i.e.
δ = 10−5 and  = 2×10−6, the ﬁtting formula predicts A = 61±34).
This result allows us to conclude that, if we account for the speciﬁc
way the parasites are seeded, both sets of simulations can be under-
stood by a common approximate theory, which we, thus, regard as
a reasonable description of the physics.

Finally, to test this hypothesis, we ran additional Snoopy sim-
ulations #SCA15a–g, #SCA15a–g, and #SCR15a–c with the same
magnetic ﬁeld strength, but much higher initial amplitudes (pro-
portional to ) of both full MRI channels (and not only perturba-
tions in the vr component which facilitated the development of the
channels) and random perturbations (proportional to δ). In all these
simulations we set  = 1.2 × 10−2 and δ = (0.02–2.27) × 10−2,
which should mimic the conditions in the Aenus simulation #A8a
at t ≈ 21 ms. We measured in these additional Snoopy simulations
that the ampliﬁcation factor indeed decreased by a factor of 2–3 to

be one order of magnitude lower than predicted by Eq. (29). How-
ever, we should recall that σ cannot really be a constant, since by
deﬁnition, after saturation the parasitic modes should not grow any
longer, implying σ → 0. Very likely, the proportionality between
γ and vc expressed in Eq. (29) is a linearisation of a more general
relation of the form γKH = kMRI f (vc), where f (vc) is a non-linear

A ≈ 18–50. This conﬁrms our hypothesis that some part of the dis-
crepancy among Aenus and Snoopy simulations can be explained
by spurious perturbations induced by the imperfect radial boundary
conditions used in the former code.

We note that the diﬀerences (by a factor of 5) in the ampli-
ﬁcation factor computed from Aenus and Snoopy probably result
from the diﬀerences in the physical assumptions (compressibility)
and in the numerical schemes employed by both codes. The MRI
termination is a highly non-linear process developing over a very
short time scale. Hence even tiny diﬀerences in the growth rates of
the parasitic instabilities can lead to non-negligible diﬀerences of
the ﬁnal MRI termination amplitude and hence the ampliﬁcation
factor.

4.2.3 Dependence on the initial magnetic ﬁeld strength in

Snoopy

Finally, we want to test the most relevant prediction of the para-
sitic model, i.e. the dependence of the ampliﬁcation factor on the
initial magnetic ﬁeld strength. As in our simulations we used the
most optimistic initial values for the magnetic ﬁeld strength (i.e.
b0z ≈ 1013 G; Obergaulinger et al. 2014), it is of crucial impor-
tance to know whether in CCNSe with weaker initial magnetic
ﬁelds the MRI will amplify the initial ﬁelds to the same value or
by the same factor (or something in between). According to the es-
timate of PG09, the MRI should amplify the initial magnetic ﬁeld
by a constant factor (Eq. 37). However, their estimate was done us-
ing termination criterion I (Eq. 30), which as we have shown with
our numerical models, is not an exact predictor of the MRI termi-
nation. According to our estimates done within the parasitic model
using termination criterion II (Eq. 47), which as we have shown
yields a much better prediction of the MRI termination, the ampli-
ﬁcation factor should be independent of the initial magnetic ﬁeld
strength provided that the ratio ˜vKH/cAz is constant. Similarly, the
estimate of A that we can infer from Latter et al. (2010) (Eq. 54)
also predicts no dependence on the initial magnetic ﬁeld strength.
Therefore, in order to address whether A is independent from the
initial magnetic ﬁeld strength, we ran several numerical models.

In Fig. 6, we present all our best resolved models done with
Aenus, i.e. #A4 #A6 and #A11 with the initial magnetic ﬁeld
strength b0z = (0.73–1.22) × 1013 G, and all Snoopy simulations
with b0z = (0.12–1.18)×1013 G. Because of the scatter of the ampli-
ﬁcation factor in Snoopy simulations, it was impossible to perform
proper convergence tests (we would need many more simulations
to compute proper averages). We ran only a few simulations with a
very high resolution, i.e. 256 and 512 zones per MRI channel (mod-
els #S17a,b and #S18, respectively), which did not diﬀer from those
ran with lower resolutions. Therefore, we conclude that simulations
done with 64 and 128 zones per MRI channels should give reason-
ably good predictions. We also marked in Fig. 6 the ampliﬁcation
factor estimated by PG09 (Eq. 37; light blue solid line) and us (dark
blue dashed line) in Eq. (47) assuming initial parasitic amplitudes
˜vKH/cAz ≈ 103 (a representative value for our simulations). When
looking at all our simulation results we can conclude that Aenus
simulations give a value of A lower by a factor of 1–6 than that
obtained with Snoopy. The discrepancy can be partly attributed to
the boundary condition and the inﬂuence of compressibility that we
discussed before.
Beyond the code agreement on the exact value of A, the am-
pliﬁcation factor seems to be indeed independent of the initial mag-
netic ﬁeld strength. This conclusion can be drawn on the light
of the results of simulations #S1a– #S1e with an initial magnetic

i.e. b0z = 0.12 G. Even in these cases, the ampliﬁcation factor stays
the same within the random scatter, i.e.A ≈ 50 (Fig. 6).

perform proper convergence studies, it is impossible to conclude
based on their results whether this scaling law was of a physical or
of a numerical origin. Indeed, Rembiasz et al. (2016a) and Rembi-
asz et al. (2016b) observed dependence of Mterm

5 SUMMARY

Since the direct numeral simulations of Obergaulinger et al. (2009)
conﬁrming the theoretical predictions of Akiyama et al. (2003),
there is no doubt that the MRI can amplify the initial magnetic
ﬁeld (close to the surface of a PNS) on a suﬃciently short time
scale in CCSNe produced by rapidly rotating progenitors. However,
the limit of such a magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation during a CCSN ex-
plosion remained unknown. In this paper, we aimed to address an
important aspect of this question, i.e. the factor by which the seed
ﬁeld of the core is ampliﬁed during the exponential growth phase
of the MRI. To this end, we performed shearing disc simulations
with an Eulerian MHD code, Aenus, solving full MHD equations

in the incompressible approximation. We compared our results to
the predictions of the parasitic model proposed and developed by
GX94, Latter et al. (2009), PG09 and Pessah (2010). Part of the
predictions of the parasitic model, i.e. that given CCSN conditions,
the MRI should be terminated by parasitic KH instabilities was con-
ﬁrmed in direct numerical simulations of Rembiasz et al. (2016a).
However, those authors neither performed systematical studies of
the ampliﬁcation factor dependence on the initial conditions, nor
compared the ﬁeld ampliﬁcation obtained in their simulations to
the predictions of the parasitic model.

Within the parasitic-termination model,

the MRI channel
modes are susceptible to secondary instabilities, in our case of KH
type. The former grow at a constant rate given by the rotational
proﬁle of the core, whereas the growth rate of the former is a func-
tion of the amplitude of the MRI and, thus, increases continuously.
At some point, they will be suﬃciently strong to disrupt the MRI
channel modes and thereby terminate the MRI growth. Based on
this observation, PG09 proposed two diﬀerent criteria to identify
the moment of parasitic termination in their analytic model: termi-
nation occurs when the growth rate of (initially developing much
more slowly) parasitic instabilities starts to exceed the growth rate
of MRI (termination criterion I), or when the amplitudes of the par-
asitic instabilities reach the amplitudes of the MRI channels (termi-
nation criterion II).

We tested these two termination criteria and found that in sim-
ulations done with both codes, termination criterion II represents a
better description of the results. MRI termination occurs when par-
asitic instabilities roughly reach the amplitudes of the MRI chan-
nels, which happens roughly 3γ−1
MRI after termination criterion I is
met.

Next, we compared the theoretical predictions of Pessah
(2010), Latter et al. (2010) and our estimates based on Pessah
(2010) for the ampliﬁcation factor with our simulation results. We
ﬁnd an order-of-magnitude agreement of Latter’s model with the
numerical simulations, although this model fails to explain all de-
pendencies accurately. This better agreement could be due to the
approximate inclusion of the background shear by Latter et al.
(2010). However, diﬀerences could also be due to non-linearities at
termination, not considered in any theoretical estimate. From our
numerical results we cannot favor any of those possibilities. Never-
theless, a more elaborate description of the parasitic instabilities in
the presence of shear may be needed for an accurate prediction of
the termination amplitude.

Another prediction of these simpliﬁed models is that the am-
pliﬁcation factor should be independent of the initial magnetic ﬁeld
strength. We tested this hypothesis with numerical simulations. Our
main ﬁnding of this paper is that independently of the initial mag-
netic ﬁeld strength, the MRI channel modes can amplify the seed
magnetic ﬁeld by a factor of 20 to 100. Once these magnetic ﬁeld
values are reached, further MRI-driven magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁca-
tion is halted as the MRI channels are attacked and destroyed by
parasitic KH instabilities.

It is true that, in principle, one could obtain an arbitrary value
of the ampliﬁcation factor from our scaling relation (Eq. 78) by tun-
ing the amplitudes of the initial perturbations. However, for phys-
ically plausible conditions found at the surface of the hot proto-
neutron star, the initial amplitudes are more likely to be of the order
∼ 0.1–1 of the rotational velocity. Under these conditions, realisti-
cally expected values of the ampliﬁcation factor are of the order
of 10. In any case, even for a highly unperturbed ﬂow with pertur-

bations ∼ 10−5 we could not ﬁnd ampliﬁcation factors exceeding
∼ 100.

MRI in CCSNe

The main conclusion that should be drawn by the supernova
community is that the amount of ﬁeld ampliﬁcation the MRI might
provide in CCSNe might be fairly limited. This ﬁnding casts doubt
on the common procedure of starting global simulations with artiﬁ-
cially enhanced ﬁeld strengths that is based on the expectation that
the MRI will provide rapid ampliﬁcation of even very weak initial
ﬁelds up to equipartition levels with the kinetic (rotational) energy.
However, one should bear in mind the limitations of our stud-
ies in which we neglected the inﬂuence of neutrinos (see Guilet et
al. 2015), buoyancy and entropy gradients (see Obergaulinger et al.
2009; Guilet & M¨uller 2015). Nevertheless, we do not think that
including these eﬀects could lead to much stronger magnetic ﬁeld
ampliﬁcation by the MRI channel modes. Moreover, we did so far
not consider any possible additional ﬁeld ampliﬁcation by a MRI-
driven dynamo acting in the turbulent saturated state after the end
of MRI channel mode growth. However its inﬂuence on the MRI
termination as well as the inﬂuence of compressibility remain un-
known.

APPENDIX A: RESCALING OF THE SIMULATIONS OF
REMBIASZ ET AL. (2016A)

Rembiasz et al. (2016a), following Obergaulinger et al. (2009), per-
formed almost ideal MHD (i.e. with Re, Rm (cid:62) 100) simulations
in a computational domain centered around the equatorial plane at
a radius ˜r0 = 15.5 km, i.e. in middle of a nascent PNS of radius
rPNS ≈ 30 km. However, according to the recent estimates of Guilet
et al. (2015), at these distances the neutrino viscosity cannot be ne-
glected and it can suppress the MRI. Therefore, since the models
can be suitably rescaled, we shifted the centre of their computa-
tional domain close to the surface of the PNS, i.e. r0 = 31 km, as it
is the most favorable place for the development of the MRI. At this
location, the diﬀerential rotation gradient and the Reynolds num-
bers are larger than deep inside the PNS.

In the current publication, we discussed some of the simula-
tions already presented in Rembiasz et al. (2016a), but this time
with the initial conditions rescaled to the properties likely present
at the surface of the PNS. The key physical quantities have been
rescaled in the following way:
