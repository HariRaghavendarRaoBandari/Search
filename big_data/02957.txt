In multiparty quantum systems, the monogamy inequality proposes an upper bound on the distri-
bution of bipartite quantum correlation between a single party and each of the remaining parties in
the system, in terms of the amount of quantum correlation shared by that party with the rest of the
system taken as a whole. However, it is well-known that not all quantum correlation measures uni-
versally satisfy the monogamy inequality. In this work, we aim at determining the non-trivial value
by which the monogamy inequality can be violated by a quantum correlation measure. Using an
information-theoretic complementarity relation between the normalized purity and quantum corre-
lation in any given multiparty state, we obtain a non-trivial lower bound on the negative monogamy
score for the quantum correlation measure. In particular, for the three-qubit states the lower bound
is equal to the negative von Neumann entropy of the single qubit reduced density matrix. We
analytically examine the tightness of the derived lower bound for certain n-qubit quantum states.
Further, we report numerical results of the same for monogamy violating correlation measures using
Haar uniformly generated three-qubit states.

INTRODUCTION

The concept of monogamy [1–3] is an intrinsic aspect in
the study of quantum correlations in multiparty systems
and plays a precursory role in quantum security [3–5] and
multiport communication protocols such as super dense-
In its most primitive avatar, monogamy of
coding [6].
quantum correlation states:
if two parties A and B in
a multiparty quantum state (say, ABC) are maximally
quantum correlated (Q(AB) = 1), then neither A nor B
can possess any quantum correlation with a third party,
i.e., Q(AC) = Q(BC) = 0. The above statement is sat-
isﬁed by all quantum correlation measures, and is a clear
departure from classical correlations which are not bound
to such constraints. Interestingly, monogamy property is
not limited to quantum correlations but is manifested in
other quantum properties such as Bell inequality viola-
tions [7], quantum steering [8], channel capacities [9], and
contextual inequalities [10].

However, in general, two parties in a quantum state
need not necessarily share maximal quantum correla-
tion, and are thus able to share some correlations with
other parties, albeit in a constrained way. The con-
cept of monogamy thus restricts the distribution of bi-
partite quantum correlations in multiparty quantum sys-
tems but its quantiﬁcation is not always achievable. For
three-qubit systems, an important ﬁgure of merit, the
monogamy inequality, was obtained for an entanglement
measure called the tangle [11].
It was shown that, for
a general three-qubit state, ABC, the amount of tangle
(τ ) shared between the party A, individually with par-
ties B and C, is bounded above by the tangle shared
by A with BC taken as a whole. Mathematically, this
implies: τ (A:BC) ≥ τ (A:B) + τ (A:C).
It is easy to
verify, that the inequality satisﬁes the aforementioned

† himadrisdhar@hri.res.in

statement for monogamy. If τ (A:B) = 1, then τ (A:C)
is necessarily zero, as τ (A:BC) ≤ 1. Moreover, the
monogamy inequality for tangle was shown to exist even
in n-qubit quantum states [12]. In literature, states and
quantum correlations that satisfy the above monogamy
inequality are termed as monogamous. However, it is
well known that the monogamy inequality is not sat-
isﬁed universally for all quantum correlation measures,
even for three-qubit states [13–18]. Entanglement mea-
sures such as entanglement of formation [19], apart from
information-theoretic measures such as quantum discord
[20] and known to be, in general, non-monogamous. Re-
cent results on monogamy have shown that quantum cor-
relation measures may satisfy the monogamy inequality
by minute extensions of the upper bound [21], increasing
fractional and integer exponents of quantum correlation
measures [22], or by considering large number of parties
[23] (cf. [24]).

(cid:80)
k Q(A:Bk ),

For all quantum correlation measures, one can de-
ﬁne a monogamy score [25], which captures the diﬀer-
ence between the non-negative quantities, Q(A:rest), and
in a quantum state, AB1B2···Bn. The
monogamy score (δQ) is postive for all measures that
satisfy the monogamy inequality, and is bounded above
by the term Q(A:rest).
In recent works, for n-qubit
pure quantum states, the upper bound for all quantum
measures, regardless of the fact that they satisfy the in-
equality, has been expressed as functions of the genuine
multipartite entanglement [26, 27]. The lower bound for
δQ is trivially zero for situations where the inequality
is satisﬁed (as δQ ≥ 0). However, for quantum corre-
lation measures that do not satisfy the monogamy in-
equality, there does not exist a non-trivial lower bound.
It is then natural to ask whether there exists a bound
on the value by which the monogamy inequality can be
violated. In this work, we address this important issue
and determine a non-trivial lower bound on the negative
monogamy score of quantum correlation measures that
violate the monogamy inequality, using an information-

theoretic complementarity between the normalized pu-
rity of the reduced state (A) and quantum correlation
shared between two parties (AB). We observe that, un-
der certain conditions, for three-qubit quantum states the
lower bound reduces to the negative of the von Neumann
entropy [28] of the single-qubit reduced density matrix.
Using a set of well-known quantum states, we analyti-
cally derive the lower bound for larger number of par-
ties and examine its variation and tightness. Moreover,
we numerically evaluate the bound for a set of entan-
glement and information-theoretic quantum correlation
measures by randomly generating Haar-uniform three-
qubit states, to show that the bound is satisﬁed. This
paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy review
the monogamy of quantum correlation measures, and the
complementarity relation between the normalized purity
of a subsystem with respect to the bipartite quantum
correlation Q in the quantum system. Lower bounds on
monogamy scores, in terms of the complementarity re-
lation, are determined in Sec. III. We then analyze, in
Sec. IV, the characteristics of the lower bound using a
few well-known quantum states and quantum correlation
measures. We conclude in Sec. V.

II. MONOGAMY AND COMPLEMENTARITY

We begin with a brief discussion on the monogamy in-
equality, as introduced by Coﬀman et al. for the tangle
of three-qubit states [11], and later expanded for higher
number of qubits [12] and other quantum correlation
measures. Consider that Q is a bipartite quantum cor-
relation measure. For a multipartite quantum system
described by state AB1B2...Bn ≡ AB, the monogamy
property is captured by the inequality

Q(ABj ) ≤ Q(AB),

(1)

n(cid:88)

j=1

where the party A is the nodal observer. Quantum cor-
relation measures that universally satisfy the above in-
equality is said to satisfy monogamy or is monogamous.
Similarly, the quantum state, AB1B2...Bn , is said to be
monogamous under the quantum correlation measure Q,
if it satisﬁes Eq. (1). We note that the state need not
be monogamous for all quantum correlations measures,
and in general, can be non-monogamous. An important
ﬁgure of merit to investigate the monogamy inequality
is the monogamy score [25]. It encapsulates the deﬁcit
between the quantities in the monogamy inequality, and
is deﬁned as

δQ = Q(AB) − n(cid:88)

j=1

Q(ABj ).

correlation of an n-party quantum state that is not cap-
tured by the distributed bipartite quantum correlations,
which in essence captures some form of multipartite cor-
relations in the system [26]. Several quantum correla-
tion measures, including entanglement monotones such
as tangle [11], squashed entanglement [29] and squared
negativity [30], are monogamous, as opposed to mea-
sures such as entanglement of formation [19], quantum
discord [20], negativity [31], logarithmic negativity [32],
and quantum work-deﬁcit [33, 34].

We now discuss an information-theoretic complemen-
tarity relation, for multipaty quantum states, between
the normalized purity of a subsystem of the state and
the bipartite quantum correlation the subsystem shares
with rest of the system, as derived in Ref. [35]. Let
us consider a bipartite quantum correlation measure Q,
for quantum state XY ∈ CdX ⊗ CdY , where X and Y
are two subsystems of the state. Let us say, Q satis-
ﬁes the conditions (i) Q(XY ) ≤ S(X ), which is true
for a host of quantum correlation measures [36], and (ii)
0 ≤ Q(XY ) ≤ log2 dY . For such measures, it has been
shown that Q obeys a non-trivial complementarity rela-
tion between purity of the reduced state, X , and the
shared bipartite quantum correlation in the state, XY ,
as given below [35]:

(cid:40)

= 1
= 2 − log2 dY

log2 dX

if dX ≤ dY
if dX > dY ,

(3)

P(X ) + Q(XY ) ≤ b

where P is deﬁned as,

P(X ) =

log2 dX − S(X )

log2 dX

,

(4)

and quantiﬁes the normalized purity of the system [37]
in the X-part, and Q(XY ), given by
Q(XY )

Q(XY ) =

min{log2 dX , log2 dY } ,

(5)

represents the normalized quantum correlation of the sys-
tem in the X:Y bipartition. For example, an impor-
tant quantity that satisﬁes the complementarity relation
is the quantum mutual information between two par-
ties, deﬁned as, I(XY ) = S(X ) + S(Y ) - S(XY )
I(XY ), which captures the total correlations
[38].
in a system, XY , satisﬁes the condition I(XY ) ≤
2 min{S(X ), S(Y )} ≤ 2 min{log2 dX , log2 dY }. Hence
if one considers the correlation, Q(XY ) = I(XY )/2,
the complementarity is naturally satisﬁed. Moreover, for
tripartite quantum states, ABC ∈ Cd ⊗ Cd ⊗ Cd, the
complementarity relation reduces to

P(AB) + Q(AB:C) ≤ 3
2

,

(6)

An obvious extension of the monogamy inequality is that
the δQ is non-negative (δQ ≥ 0) for all monogamous Q.
One can interpret a positive δQ as “residual” quantum

and is independent of the dimension of the system, and
can be shown to be saturated by the Greenberger-Horne-
Zeilinger (GHZ) state [39].

This complementarity relation has potential applica-
tion in quantum information protocol. In particular, it
has been used to obtain a security proof of quantum cryp-
tography for individual attacks via a variation [40] of the
Ekert key distribution [1] protocol. We note that the
complementarity relation in Eq. (3), is satisﬁed by a host
of quantum correlation measures, irrespective of the con-
ditions (i) and (ii), as shown in Appendix A (cf. [35]).

III. LOWER BOUNDS ON MONOGAMY

SCORES

An important aspect of the monogamy score,

in
Eq. (2),
is that the quantity has a distinct upper
bound given by the term Q(AB), where we use AB
= A(B1···Bn). This implies that for monogamous Q, the
amount of distributed bipartite entanglement in a multi-
partite state is bounded by the amount of block entangle-
ment shared by a single party with the rest of the system.
Interestingly, it has been shown that the upper bound of
δQ, for a large number of pure n-qubit states, is deter-
mined by a set of entropic or quadratic functions of the
genuine multipartite entanglement [41, 42] of the state
AB [26, 27]. Moreover, for monogamous Q, there exists
a deﬁnite lower bound on δQ, given by δQ > 0. How-
ever, for Q that does not satisfy monogamy inequality, in
general, the situation is not straightforward. Though the
upper bound remains the same, a non-trivial lower bound
is not obvious. For cases where AB is not monogamous
with respect to Q, δQ can be negative. One of the pri-
mary motivation of our work is to ﬁnd out the non-trivial
degree or limit to which this violation of monogamy in-
equality occurs. In other words, we question, what is the
worst negative value of the quantity δQ?
In this section, we aim at obtaining the lower bound
on monogamy scores, for non-monogamous measures Q,
by making use of the complementarity relation, given in
Eq. (3). In deriving the lower bounds on δQ below, we
will use the notation QXY ≡ Q(XY ), QXY ≡ Q(XY ),
PX ≡ P(X ), among others, and where X = TrY XY .
Consider an arbitrary multipartite quantum state AB ≡
A(B1B2...Bn) of n + 1 parties. For a normalized bipartite
quantum correlation measure Q, a trivial lower bound on
the monogamy score is provided in terms of the number
of parties in the system B (= B1B2 . . . Bn), as given by

δQ = QAB − n(cid:88)

QABk ≥ −(n − 1).

(7)

3

Similarly,

for the reduced density matrices, ABk ,
where all parties except A and Bk have been traced
(AB), we obtain PA + QABk
out, i.e., ABk = TrABk
= xk ≤ bk. Summing over all k, we get the relation

n(cid:88)

n(cid:88)

xk ≤ n(cid:88)

nPA +

QABk =

bk.

(9)

k=1

k=1

k=1

When dA ≤ dBk (say, dA = dBk = d), using the com-
plementarity relation (3), one has bk = 1, ∀ bk. Hence,
Eq. (9) can be written as

n(cid:88)
n(cid:88)

or,

n(cid:88)

QABk =

xk ≤ n

k=1

QABk ≤ n(1 − PA).

(10)

δQ = QAB− n(cid:88)

Subtracting Eq. (10) from Eq. (8), we obtain an expres-
sion for the monogamy score, δQ, which upon arranging,
gives us

QABk ≥ −(n−1)(1−PA)−(1−x0). (11)

k=1

By rearranging Eq. (11), one can show that the obtained
lower bound on monogamy score can be improved, in
comparison to Eq. (7), as is evident from
1 − x0

δQ ≥ −(n − 1)

1 − PA +

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

.

For large n or for x0 ≥ 1, the lower bound on monogamy
score reduces to

δQ ≥ −(n − 1)(1 − PA),

(13)
where PA is the normalized purity deﬁned in Eq. (4),
and ranges from 0 ≤ PA ≤ 1. For the important three-
qubit states, which have received a lot of attention in the
study of monogamy, we observe that the lower bound on
the monogamy score is given by, δQ ≥ −S(A), where
S(A) is the von Neumann entropy of the subsystem A.
This shows that the lower bound satisﬁes the limits for
monogamy (δQ (cid:38) 0) for states that are weakly entangled
along the A : rest bipartition, such that S(A) ≈ 0.

IV. ANALYZING THE LOWER BOUND

To obtain a non-trivial lower bound on the δQ for non-
monogamous measures, we use the complementarity re-
lation as shown below. For ρAB, using the relation in
Eq. (3), we can write

PA + QAB = x0 (say) ≤ b0
or , QAB = x0 − PA.

(8)

Let us now examine the lower bound of the monogamy
score, δQ, for certain quantum states. For example, we
consider (n + 1)-party quantum states AB1···Bn ∈ C2 ⊗
CdB1 ⊗ ··· ⊗ CdBn . For these states, the lower bound in
relation (13) becomes δQ ≥ −(n− 1)S(A). For dBk = 2,
∀ k, the above expression for the lower bound of δQ holds
for all multiqubit quantum states.

Let us consider the generalized superposition of GHZ
[39] state and W state [43, 44], which are permutationally
invariant multiqubit states given by

4

|Ψα,γ(cid:105) = α|0(cid:105)⊗n + β|1(cid:105)⊗n + γ|W n(cid:105),

(14)
where |W n(cid:105) is the W state for n qubits, (α, β, γ) are
complex numbers that satisfy |α|2 + |β|2 + |γ|2 = 1.
The n-qubit state, |Ψα,γ(cid:105), satisﬁes the lower bound for
the monogamy score, given by δQ ≥ −(n − 2)S(α,γ),
where α,γ = Trn−1(|Ψα,γ(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψα,γ|) is obtained by tracing
out n − 1 qubits. α,γ can be written as

(cid:113) 1

The largest eigenvalue of the single qubit state α,γ is

1 − 4|α|2|β|2 − 4(n − 1)

Hence, S(α,γ) is equal to h(e), where h(x) is the Shan-
non (binary) entropy [45] of the variable x. The lower
bound of the monogamy score is given by, δQ ≥ −(n −
2)h(e). Hence, a tight lower bound on the monogamy
score is obtained for low values of h(e).

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

1 +(cid:112)1 − 4|α|2|β|2

If we set, γ = 0, then we obtain the generalized
|ΨGHZ(cid:105) = α|0(cid:105)⊗n + β|1(cid:105)⊗n, and the
GHZ state,
largest eigenvalue of the single qubit reduced state is
1
, which is independent of n. For
2
states with |α|2 = |β|2 = 1/2, e = 1/2, and h(e) = 1,
which gives us a weak bound. However, for states with
|α|2|β|2 ≈ 0, e ≈ 1, which implies h(e) ≈ 0. For these
states, the lower bound of the monogamy score is given
by, δQ ≥ −, where  → 0. Alternately, if one sets, α =
β = 0, such that γ = 1, one obtains the n-qubit W state,
given by |ΨW(cid:105) = 1√
sum in the expression is over all P permutations of the
product states with a single |1(cid:105). The maximum eigen-
value of the reduced state is then given by, e = n−1
n ,
and h(e) = h(1/n). Hence, as n increases, the quantity
h(e) → 0, and hence we obtain, δQ (cid:38) 0.
To expand the study on W states, we consider the n-
qubit Dicke state [46] containing all P permutations of
n − r qubits in |0(cid:105) and r qubits in |1(cid:105) state, as given in
the equation

(cid:80)P(cid:0)|0(cid:105)⊗(n−1) ⊗ |1(cid:105)(cid:1), where the

|Ψr,n(cid:105) =

.

(16)

r

For r = 1, the Dicke state is the same as an n-qubit W
state, |ΨW(cid:105), mentioned earlier. The single qubit reduced
n (or n−r
state eigenvalue, e, is equal to r
n ), and hence
h(e) = h(r/n). Hence, as the r
n ratio decreases, h(e)
decreases, and we obtain, δQ (cid:38) 0. However, for r = n/2,
h(e) = 1, and the lower bound on the monogamy score
is weak.

FIG. 1. (Color online.) The score, δ ≡ δQ, of monogamy in-
equality violating quantum correlation measures for a set of
(2×104) randomly generated Haar uniform three-qubit states,
plotted along the x-axis, with respect to the negative von Neu-
mann entropy (−S(A)) of party A, plotted along the y-axis.
The measures are negativity (black-circle), logarithmic neg-
ativity (red-square), quantum discord (blue-diamond), quan-
tum work-deﬁcit (green-cross), and conditional mutual infor-
mation (violet-triangle). The ﬁgure shows that δQ ≥ −S(A).
It is evident that the lower bound is tight for states with low
reduced entropy.

Now we look at the monogamy score for a set of quan-
tum correlation measures. We generate a large number of
random Haar uniform three-qubit states, and compute δQ
for a set of monogamy inequality violating measures such
as negativity (N ), logarithmic negativity (L), quantum
discord (D), quantum work-deﬁcit (∆), and conditional
mutual information (J ). For the generated pure and
mixed three-qubit states, and for the above measures, it
is observed that the monogamy score satisﬁes the lower
bound, δQ ≥ −S(A), as shown in Fig. 1.

V. CONCLUSION

Quantum correlations are an important aspect of mod-
ern physics and a key enabler in quantum communi-
cation and computation technologies. The concept of
monogamy is a distinguishing feature of quantum cor-
relations, which sets it apart from classical correlations,
and has played a signiﬁcant role in devising quantum
security in secret key generation and multiparty commu-
nication protocols. In recent years, a signiﬁcant amount
of research has been devoted to understand the role of
monogamy in various quantum phenomena, including vi-
olation of Bell inequalities and contextuality, and also in
investigating correlation properties beyond quantum me-
chanics, such as in no-signalling theories. Lots of eﬀort
have also been spent in devising stronger monogamy con-
ditions [47–51] and to extend known features in discrete
quantum states to continuous variable systems [52].

An important tool

in quantitatively capturing the
concept of monogamy of quantum correlations is the
monogamy inequality, which bounds from above the dis-

tribution of quantum correlations among diﬀerent parties
in a multiparty state. The monogamy inequality can be
studied in terms of the monogamy score. All monogamy
inequality satisfying measures have a positive monogamy
score, which is bounded above by a well deﬁned value
that can be derived as functions of the genuine multipar-
tite entanglement of the quantum state. However, not all
quantum correlation measures satisfy the monogamy in-
equality, and in general, the monogamy score can be neg-
ative. Interestingly, there exists no perceptible limiting
value on the negative monogamy score. The main contri-
bution of our work is the determination of a non-trivial
lower bound of the monogamy score for measures and
states where the monogamy inequality is violated. This
is achieved using a complementarity relation between the
normalized purity of a subsystem and the bipartite quan-
tum correlation in the system. Subsequently, we analyze
the strength and weakness of the lower bound for dif-
ferent quantum states and measures of quantum corre-
lation, and observe conditions that immediately lead to
monogamy. The results in the paper provide a unifying
framework to study monogamy relations in both entan-
glement and information-theoretic quantum correlations,
and are an important addition to the study of monogamy
that opens possible directions for further investigation.

Appendix A: Quantum correlation measures and the

complementarity relation

In our work, we investigate the lower bound on the
monogamy score of quantum correlation measures that
violate the monogamy inequality, using a complementar-
ity relation between the normalized purity and normal-
ized bipartite quantum correlation.
In this Appendix,
we discuss some entanglement, and information-theoretic
quantum correlation measures that we have used in our
study (see Figs. 1 and 2), and look at the validity of the
complementarity relation from the context of our results.
We begin with two measures of entanglement that are,
in general, known to violate the monogamy inequality,
namely, the negativity [31] and the logarithmic negativity
[32]. Negativity (N ) is a computable measure of bipartite
entanglement, which is deﬁned in terms of the eigenval-
AB. N is the
ues of the partially transposed matrix ΓA
sum of the absolute value of the negative eigenvalues of
AB, or equivalently, N (AB) =
, where (cid:107) · (cid:107)1
ΓA
is the trace-norm. For upto dimension 2 × 3, N = 0
for separable states. An extension of the entanglement
measure of negativity, is the non-convex entanglement
monotone, called the logarithmic negativity (L). Mathe-
matically, L = log2 (cid:107)ΓA
AB(cid:107)1, and in terms of N , it is equal
to log2(2N +1). Both N and L are non-monogamous en-
tanglement monotones.

To analyze information-theoretic quantum correla-
tions, we consider the measures of quantum discord [20]
and quantum work-deﬁcit [33]. Along the way, we also
consider the quantum mutual information [38], as a mea-

sure of total correlations, and the measured mutual in-
formation, which has been characterized as classical part
of total correlations [20, 53]. Information-theoretic mea-
sures of quantum correlations draw upon speciﬁc prop-
erties of classical information theory [54], and puts them
under a quantum microscope. For example, consider two
expressions of mutual information between two parties:
I(AB) = S(A) + S(B) − S(AB), and J (AB) =
S(B) − S(B|A). From a classical context, if S(x) is
the Shannon entropy and AB, along with A and B,
are classical variables, the quantities I and J are equal.
However, from a quantum perspective, where S(x) is the
von Neumann entropy and AB is a bipartite quantum
density matrix, I is the quantum mutual information and
J is the measured mutual information, and are, in gen-
eral, not equal. I, captures the total correlation between
the two parties in AB, whereas J captures the classi-
cal part of the mutual information. This is due to the
fact the conditional entropy, S(B|A), used to deﬁne J
involves local measurements on one of the subsytems,
which washes away all quantum correlations. Quantum
discord (D), in a bipartite quantum state, is deﬁned as
the diﬀerence between the two quantities: D(AB) =
I(AB) - J (AB). Another measure deﬁned using an in-

0.20.40.60.81.1.20.010.030.050.070.09x0f0.20.40.60.81.1.21.40.010.030.050.070.09x0f0.20.40.60.81.0.010.030.050.070.09x0f0.20.40.60.81.0.010.030.050.070.09x0fformation perspective is the quantum work-deﬁcit (∆),
which is derived as the deﬁcit between the amount of pure
quantum states that are permitted for extraction under
the set of closed global operations and product states
that are obtained under a class of closed local operations
and classical operations (closed LOCC). For a bipartite
quantum state AB, the number of pure qubits obtained
under global operations, performed through sequential
application of unitary and dephasing operations, is given
by IG(AB) = N − S(ρAB), where N = log2 d. Here,
d is the dimension of the system. Under closed LOCC
operations, optimized via local unitary and dephasing
operations, and classical exchange of information, the
number of pure classical states obtained is IL(AB) =
N−inf Λ[S((cid:48)
AB)]. Λ belongs to the class of closed LOCC
operations. The quantum correlation measure ∆ is de-
ﬁned as: ∆ = IG − IL.

The complementarity relation, deﬁned in Eq. (3), holds
for quantum correlation measures that satisfy the condi-

6
tions, (i) Q(XY ) ≤ S(X ), which holds for a host of
quantum correlation measures, such as entanglement of
formation, distillable entanglement, entanglement cost,
quantum mutual
information, relative entropy of en-
tanglement, and classical correlation [35, 36], (ii) 0 ≤
Q(XY ) ≤ log2 dY , which is known to be deﬁnitely satis-
ﬁed by quantum mutual information. It should be noted
that there may exist quantum correlation measures Q
that may not satisfy one or both of the above conditions,
or where the proof is not easily accessible, but may still
satisfy the non-trivial complementarity relation given by,
P(ρX ) + Q(ρXY ) ≤ x0, where x0 < 2. An analysis of the
quantum correlation measures of negativity, logarithmic
negativity, quantum discord, and quantum work-deﬁcit,
for random Haar uniform generated rank-1 and rank-2
three-qubit states are shown in Fig. 2. A similar result
was also observed in [35]. We note that for rank-1 three-
qubit states, PA + QA:BC = 1, for D and ∆. This is not
the case for the entanglement measures, N and L.
