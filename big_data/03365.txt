By using the Gutzwiller projected fermionic states and the variational Monte Carlo technique,
we study the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with the ﬁrst-neighbor (J1), second-neighbor (J2), and
additional scalar chiral interaction JχSi · (Sj × Sk) on the triangular lattice. In the non-magnetic
phase regime 0.08 (cid:46) J2/J1 (cid:46) 0.16 of the J1− J2 model, recent density-matrix renormalization group
studies [Zhu and White, Phys. Rev. B 92, 041105 (2015); Hu, Gong, Zhu, and Sheng, Phys. Rev.
B 92, 140403 (2015)] ﬁnd a possible gapped spin liquid with the signal of a competition between a
chiral and a Z2 spin liquid. Motivated by the DMRG results, we consider the chiral perturbation
JχSi · (Sj × Sk) in the non-magnetic regime. We ﬁnd that as Jχ grows, the gapless U(1) Dirac spin
liquid, which is the best variational wave function when Jχ = 0, has the instability towards a gapped
spin liquid with non-trivial magnetic ﬂuxes and nonzero chiral order. We calculate topological Chern
number and ground-state degeneracy, both of which identify this ﬂux state as the chiral spin liquid
with fractionalized Chern number C = 1/2 and two-fold topological degeneracy. Our results indicate
a positive direction to stabilize a chiral spin liquid near the J1 − J2 model.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum spin liquid is one kind of long-range entan-
gled states without breaking neither spin rotation nor lat-
tice translation symmetries even at zero temperature1,2.
The physics of spin liquid has been playing an essential
role to understand strongly correlated systems and un-
conventional superconductivity3,4. The emergent topo-
logical order5–7 and fractionalized quasiparticles8–10 of
spin liquid have wide applications on quantum compu-
tations and quantum communications11. In experiment,
one of the best candidates to realize spin liquid is frus-
trated antiferromagnetic material. A natural way to form
geometric frustration is to have the corner-sharing trian-
gle and the face-sharing triangle structures on lattice.

The simplest lattice which is constructed from corner-
sharing triangles is the kagom´e lattice. At experi-
mental side, the most promising materials to realize
spin liquid on kagom´e lattice are the spin-1/2 antifer-
romagnets herbertsmithite and kapellasite12–17. Theo-
retically, density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
studies consistently ﬁnd a gapped spin liquid in the spin-
1/2 kagom´e Heisenberg model with the nearest-neighbor
(NN) interactions18–20 However, the variational studies
based on projected fermionic parton wave functions favor
a gapless U(1) Dirac spin liquid (DSL) with competing
ground-state energy21–24. Near the NN model, a robust
chiral spin liquid (CSL)25,26 is unambiguously established
by introducing second- and third-neighbor couplings or
chiral interaction27–33. This CSL spontaneously breaks
time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and is identiﬁed as the
ν = 1/2 bosonic fractional quantum Hall state.

On the other hand, the typical system with face-
sharing triangles is the simple spin-1/2 triangular lattice
systems. The NN Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model

on the triangular lattice is the ﬁrst candidate proposed
to realize a spin liquid3; however, a 120◦ antiferromag-
netic order is found in the subsequent studies34–38. Al-
though spin liquid does not exist in the NN model, both
experimental and theoretical studies ﬁnd that the com-
peting interactions may open a new route for realizing
such states.
In the organic weak Mott insulators with
triangular lattice structure such as κ-(ET)2Cu2(CN)3
39–44, no magnetic order is ob-
and EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2]2
served at the temperature much lower than the inter-
action energy scale. The spin liquid behaviors are ex-
plained by a gapless spin Bose metal of a triangular
model with four-site ring-exchange couplings45–48. The
space anisotropy of the NN couplings has also been stud-
ied extensively as a possible mechanism to induce a spin
liquid state or a spin spiral phase49–53. Recently, diﬀer-
ent theoretical studies consistently ﬁnd a non-magnetic
phase in the J1 − J2 triangular Heisenberg model be-
tween the 120◦ and the stripe antiferromagnetic phases
for 0.08 (cid:46) J2/J1 (cid:46) 0.1554–62. DMRG results ﬁnd a pos-
sible gapped spin liquid in this non-magnetic regime58,59.
However, the system appears to have a competition be-
tween a spin liquid breaking TRS and the Z2 spin liquid
preserving TRS59, which may imply strong ﬁnite-size ef-
fects in DMRG calculations as the system has diﬃculty
to settle into one state. On the other hand, recent vari-
ational Monte Carlo studies62 ﬁnd that the gapless U(1)
DSL is the best candidate, whose energy is lower than the
variational energies for various Z2 spin liquids63,64. Here,
this non-magnetic regime with various candidate states
seems to like the situation of the NN kagom´e model,
where diﬀerent perturbations have been considered and
a robust CSL is established. Inspired by the competing
chiral state found in DMRG59, we address the issue that
whether a CSL might be stabilized by introducing further

Motivated by this question, we use the variational
Monte Carlo (VMC) calculations based on the ﬂux state
of fermionic representation to study the J1 − J2 trian-
gular Heisenberg model with additional TRS breaking
chiral interactions. The model Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

(cid:88)

where J1 and J(cid:48)
1 are the horizontal and zigzag NN cou-
plings, respectively (see Fig. 1(a)). We set J1 = 1.0
as energy scale, and focus on the phase regime with
0.96 ≤ J(cid:48)
1 ≤ 1.04 and 0 ≤ J2 ≤ 0.15. The chiral cou-
plings Jχ have the same magnitude in each triangle (up
triangle (cid:52) and down triangle (cid:53)) as shown in Fig. 1(a),
and the sites i, j, and k follow the clockwise order in
all triangles.
In recent VMC calculations, some topo-
logical features of the spin liquids constructed based on
fermionic ﬂux states have been obtained65–67.
In par-
ticular, the VMC studies ﬁnd the CSL in the extended
kagom´e model by showing the ground-state degeneracy
and topological Chern number32. In our calculations, we
will follow these techniques.
Through our VMC calculations, we ﬁnd that while the
120◦ antiferromagnetic order vanishes at a ﬁnite chiral
coupling Jχ for J2 (cid:46) 0.08, the gapless U(1) DSL in the
non-magnetic regime 0.08 (cid:46) J2 (cid:46) 0.15 has the instability
towards a CSL as soon as we turn on the Jχ term. This
CSL has a quantized topological Chern number C = 1/2
and two-fold topological degenerate ground states, which
characterize the CSL as the ν = 1/2 fractional quantum
Hall state. We also study the relation between the chiral
order and the lattice anisotropy of J1 coupling in the CSL
phase regime. We ﬁnd the consistent behaviors with the
DMRG results59 that some spin coupling anisotropy may
enhance the robustness of the CSL. Our VMC results
indicate a positive direction to stabilize a CSL near the
non-magnetic phase in the J1 − J2 triangular Heisenberg
model.

II. VARIATIONAL WAVE FUNCTIONS

Following one of the novel ways to construct spin liquid
states beyond the mean-ﬁeld level, we introduce the pro-
jected fermionic wave functions for our variational calcu-
lations68. In this representation, spin operator Si is ex-

where σ = (σx, σy, σz) is the Pauli matrices and c

(ci,σ) creates (annihilates) an electron with spin σ at site
i. Therefore, the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) could be repre-
sented using the fermionic operators, and the Gutzwiller
i(1 − ni↑ni↓) is introduced to enforce
no double occupation on each site. For the variational

projector PG =(cid:81)

(0.08 < J2 < 0.16); thus, we consider the mean-ﬁeld

the positive (negative) signs of tij, which deﬁne a mag-
netic ﬂux Φ = 0 crossing up triangles and Φ = π crossing
down triangles (or opposite)62–64. Thus, the unit cell
is doubled in this DSL. In our studies considering bond
anisotropy and CSL, we allow the anisotropy of the NN
hoping tij and t(cid:48)

i.e., tij = |tij|eiφij . In Fig. 1(b), we show the Ansatz of

triangles have the ﬂuxes θ2 = π − θ1. Such a state can
be denoted as [θ1, π − θ1]. Thus, using this symbol, the
U(1) DSL has the ﬂuxes [0, π], and the wave functions
with non-zero θ1 describe the states with spin chirality5.
We will also consider the eﬀect of Jχ to the 120◦ N´eel

sites within the same unit cell) with q = (4π/3, 0). For

tuations around the classical spin state.
In this paper we study the competitions among the
120◦ N´eel state, the gapless U(1) DSL, and the gapped
CSL. We perform variational calculations at half ﬁll-
ing on toric clusters with L × L sites under the peri-
odic/antiperiodic boundary conditions (PBC/APBC). In
order to ﬁnd the energetically favored state, we use the
stochastic reconﬁguration (SR) optimization method70 to
optimize the variational parameters.

III. COMPETITION BETWEEN MAGNETIC

AND CHIRAL ORDERS

First of all, we study the competition between the mag-
netic and chiral orders for J2 (cid:46) 0.08. When Jχ = 0,
the system has the 120◦ N´eel order. When Jχ is much
larger than J1 coupling, the classical spin analyses show
that the system would become a non-coplanar tetrahe-
dral state with four sublattices, where the spins of four
sublattices point toward the corners of a tetrahedron71.
Therefore, we expect a phase diagram like either “120◦
N´eel - tetrahedral” or “120◦ N´eel - intermediate phase
- tetrahedral”. Interestingly, the CSL discovered in the
kagom´e model emerges between a 120◦ N´eel phase and

3

the non-coplanar cuboc phase30. In our present studies,
we do not include the variational wave function of the
tetrahedral state. Thus, we only consider the vanishing
of the 120◦ N´eel order with the increase of Jχ (we expect
further studies using unbiased methods to investigate the
phase transition between the 120◦ N´eel and the tetrahe-
dral phases in the future work).

In our variational calculations for J2 (cid:46) 0.08, we start
from the wave function Eq. (4) and optimize the pa-
rameter h and Jastrow factor vij. h = 0 describes
the vanished N´eel order. We study the lattice with
L = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, where the 120◦ N´eel order is not
frustrated by boundary conditions. In Fig. 2, we show
the variational parameter h of magnetic order for J2 = 0
and 0.05 with Jχ on diﬀerent clusters. For both J2 cou-
plings with small Jχ, the variational parameter h de-
creases quite slowly with increasing system sizes and
smoothly extrapolates to a ﬁnite value in the thermo-
dynamic limit. When Jχ is large enough (Jχ (cid:38) 0.1), the
magnetic order parameter h decreases sharply and scales
to vanishing when L → ∞. Our results clearly indicate
that there is a phase transition with vanished 120◦ N´eel
order at a ﬁnite Jχ.

IV. CHIRAL SPIN LIQUID EMERGING NEAR

THE GAPLESS DIRAC SPIN LIQUID

In this section we study the possible CSL near the gap-
less U(1) DSL. We start from the non-magnetic vari-
ational wave function Eq. (3) without magnetic term
(h = 0) and spin Jastrow factor (vij = 0). Thus, the
variational parameters are the imaginary part of t1 and
both real and imaginary parts of t(cid:48)
1. We will focus our
studies for J2 = 0.1.

FIG. 2:
(Color online) Finite-size scaling of the magnetic
order variational parameter h for J2 = 0 and 0.05. We use
the L × L toric clusters with PBC at L = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30.
Quadratic ﬁttings are used for all the data.

FIG. 3:
(Color online) The variational Monte Carlo opti-
mizations of the ﬂux θ1 = 3 arctan(Im(t1)/Re(t1)) are shown

1. Optimization and measurement of local order parameters

For the isotropic system with J1 = J(cid:48)

1, we have t1 = t(cid:48)
1,
and the only variational parameter is the imaginary part
of the NN hopping. Before discussing the results, we
demonstrate the good convergence of our calculations. In
Fig. 3, we show the optimization of θ1 for J2 = 0.1, Jχ =
0.05 on the 6 × 6 and 12 × 12 clusters. We obtain the
converged θ1 after optimization, which are found to be
independent of initial values.

To study the CSL, we optimize the variational wave
function for diﬀerent Jχ on diﬀerent system size with L
up to L = 30. On the L = 6 and L = 12 clusters, we
study the system with Jχ up to 0.3. As shown in Fig. 4,
the optimized ﬂux θ1 increases with the growing Jχ. For
Jχ = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, we study the larger clusters, which
give the optimized θ1 that almost do not change with
increasing system size.
In the inset of Fig. 4, we also
show the ﬁnite-size scaling of the ground-state energy
for small Jχ, which support the good convergence of the
calculations with system size.

With the optimized ﬁnite variational parameter θ1,
we expect non-zero chiral order of the optimized wave
function, which can be measured through the three spins
scalar chirality in each triangle as:

(cid:104)χ(cid:105) = (cid:104)S1 · (S2 × S3)(cid:105).

(5)

In our calculations, we ﬁnd that the chiral order parame-
ter (cid:104)χ(cid:105) of the up and down triangles are the same within
In Fig. 5, we show (cid:104)χ(cid:105) as a function of

the chiral coupling Jχ on diﬀerent clusters up to L = 30,
which grows continuously with increasing Jχ. The ﬁnite-
size scaling in the inset of Fig. 5 clearly demonstrates the
non-zero chirality in the thermodynamic limit.

the ﬁnite size scaling for the chirality (cid:104)χ(cid:105) at Jχ = 0.02, 0.05,
and 0.1.

2. Topological properties

In order to characterize the non-trivial topological
properties of the chiral state, we calculate the topological
Chern number and the ground state degeneracy.

In our calculations, the topological Chern number
is computed as the integral over the Berry curvature

In the variational approach with Gutzwiller projected
parton construction, the degeneracy of the wave func-
tion is consistent with number of the linear independence
states of the fermionic variational wave functions accord-
ing to the SU(2) Chern-Simons theory.65–67 The idea65–67
is that through changing the boundary conditions of the
mean ﬁeld Hamiltonian to either periodic or antiperiodic
in (cid:126)a1 and (cid:126)a2 directions (see Fig. 1(b)), we can obtain four
projected states denoted as |ψ1, ψ2(cid:105). We label ψi = 0
for periodic boundary condition and π for antiperiodic
boundary condition (i = 1, 2), i.e., these four projected
states are {|0, 0(cid:105),|0, π(cid:105),|π, 0(cid:105),|π, π(cid:105)}. Then we can cal-
culate the overlaps between any two of the four states
to obtain the overlap matrix65–67, and the number of
the nonzero eigenvalues of this overlap matrix gives the
number of the linearly independent states. Based on the
experience of the similar calculations on kagom´e antifer-
romagnet32, we should choose a state with a big mean-
ﬁeld band gap to suppress the strong ﬁnite-size eﬀects on
small clusters. Thus, we calculate the overlap matrix on
the 8 × 8 cluster for the state with ﬂux θ1 = π/2 (this
state has a big mean-ﬁeld band gap 4.1), and obtain the
overlap matrix O as

In this calculation, we ﬁx the global phases in such a way
that all the overlaps with |0, 0(cid:105) are set to real. The num-
ber of the independent ground states can be found by
diagonalizing the overlap matrix, i.e., O = U†ΛU . We
ﬁnd that only two eigenvalues are non-zero, which indi-
cates that only two eigenvectors are linearly independent.
This fact implies that the ground-state degeneracy is two-
fold. Our calculations of topological Chern number and
ground state degeneracy consistently suggest that this
chiral state is the ν = 1/2 Laughlin state.

B. Anisotropic system with J1 (cid:54)= J(cid:48)

1

In the DMRG studies on the J1 − J2 triangular model,
a weak chiral order is found on the ﬁnite-size system in
the even sector, and by tuning the bond anisotropy J1
1 (J1 and J(cid:48)
and J(cid:48)
1 are along the vertical and the zigzag
directions, respectively) the chiral order seems to en-
hance with J1 − J(cid:48)
1/J1 (cid:46) 1.0459. The
1 for 0.96 (cid:46) J(cid:48)
bond anisotropy and chiral order appear to have inter-
esting competition. In this part, we introduce the bond

competition. We choose J2 = Jχ = 0.1 and change the
anisotropy J(cid:48)
1 from 0.96 to 1.04. Correspondingly, we use
the variational wave function with t1 (cid:54)= t(cid:48)
1 (see Fig. 1(b)).
Thus, there are three variational parameters (imaginary
part of t1, real and imaginary parts of t(cid:48)
1), including two
ﬂuxes that need to be optimized. Since the optimiza-
tions with two ﬂuxes are very time consuming, we only
did variational calculations on the L = 12 and 18 clus-
ters.
1 (cid:54)= J1,
we obtain |t1| (cid:54)= |t(cid:48)
1| after optimization, which indicates
that the optimized wave functions break lattice rotational
symmetry. Then, we measure the spin chirality (cid:104)χ(cid:105) for
diﬀerent J(cid:48)
1. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 7(b), we ﬁnd
that when J(cid:48)
1 < J1, the chiral order is enhanced with
1|; on the contrary when J(cid:48)
increasing anisotropy |J1−J(cid:48)
1 >
J1, chiral order is suppressed with increasing |J1 − J(cid:48)
1|.

As shown in Fig. 7(a), we ﬁnd that once J(cid:48)

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic J1−J2
Heisenberg model with additional chiral coupling JχSi ·
(Sj × Sk) on the triangular lattice. By performing the
variational Monte Carlo simulations and considering dif-
ferent variational wave functions, we ﬁnd that while the
120◦ N´eel order vanishes at a ﬁnite Jχ, and the gap-
less U(1) Dirac spin liquid in the intermediate regime
would become a chiral spin liquid once Jχ starts to
grow. By calculating the topological Chern number and
ground-state degeneracy, we identify this CSL as the
ν = 1/2 Laughlin state. We also consider the relation
between the chiral order and the spacial anisotropy in the
model, and we ﬁnd that the chiral order can be enhanced

(suppressed) when the anisotropic parameter J(cid:48)
1 < J1
(J(cid:48)
1 > J1), which is consistent with the DMRG observa-
tion. Our results suggest a new way to stabilize a chiral
spin liquid near the J1 − J2 triangular model. Finally we
would like to mention that we have not considered all the
possible variational states, and it is worth to use unbi-
ased numerical simulations such as DMRG to clarify the
phase diagram and the properties of the ground states.
