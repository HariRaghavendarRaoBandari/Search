Quantum geometrodynamics with intrinsic time development is presented. Paradigm shift from
full space-time covariance to spatial diﬀeomorphism invariance yields a non-vanishing Hamiltonian,
a resolution of the ‘problem of time’, and gauge-invariant temporal ordering in an ever expanding
universe. Einstein’s general relativity is a particular realization of a wider class of theories; and
the framework prompts natural extensions and improvements, with the consequent dominance of
Cotton-York potential at early times when the universe was small.

INTRODUCTION

All of us experience the passage of time. But is time an illusion of our perception, an emergent semi-classical
entity, or is it present at the fundamental level even in quantum gravity? General relativity (GR), Einstein’s theory of
classical space-time, ties space and time to (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry. But in quantum gravity, space-time is a
concept of ‘limited applicability’[1]. That semi-classical space-time is emergent begs the question what, if anything at
all, plays the role of ‘time’ in quantum gravity? Wheeler went as far as to claim we have to forgo time-ordering, and to
declare ‘there is no spacetime, there is no time, there is no before, there is no after’[1]. But without ‘time -ordering’,
how is ‘causality’, which is requisite in any ‘sensible physical theory’, enforced in quantum gravity? Furthermore,
a resolution of the ‘problem of time’ in quantum gravity cannot be deemed complete if it fails to account for the
intuitive physical reality of time and does not provide satisfactory correlation between time development in quantum
dynamics and the passage of time in classical space-times.

Wheeler also emphasized it is 3-geometry, rather than 4-geometry, which is fundamental in quantum geometrody-
namics. The call to abandon 4-covariance is not new. Simpliﬁcations in the Hamiltonian analysis of GR, and the fact
that the physical degrees of freedom involve only the spatial metric, lead Dirac to conclude that ‘four-dimensional
symmetry is not a fundamental property of the physical world’[2]. A key obstacle to the viability of GR as a pertur-
bative quantum ﬁeld theory lies in the conﬂict between unitarity and space-time general covariance: renormalizability
can be attained with higher-order curvature terms, but space-time covariance requires time as well as spatial deriva-
tives of the same (higher) order, thus compromising unitarity. Relinquishing 4-covariance to achieve power-counting
renormalizability through modiﬁcations of GR with higher-order spatial, rather than space-time, curvature terms was
Horava’s bold proposal[3].

Geometrodynamics bequeathed with positive-deﬁnite spatial metric is the simplest consistent framework to im-

these are labeled as constant-t hypersurfaces[4]. Quantum states however do not depend on t; in his seminal work,
DeWitt observed that the wave function of the universe can depend only on the 3-geometry, and time must be
determined intrinsically[5]. The canonical action of GR may be written as

S = Z ˜πij ˙qij d3xdt −Z (cid:0)N H + N iHi(cid:1) d3xdt + boundary term,

wherein the super-Hamiltonian H = 2κ√q (cid:2)Gijkl ˜πij ˜πkl + V(qij )(cid:3), and Hi = −2qij∇k ˜πkj = 0 is the super-
momentum constraint which generates spatial diﬀeomorphisms of the variables. The DeWitt supermetric, Gijkl =

A framework for quantum geometrodynamics without the paradigm of space-time covariance, and equipped with
spatial diﬀeomorphism-invariant physical Hamiltonian, has been advocated in a series of works[6–10]. It resolves ‘the
problem of time’ and bridges the deep divide between quantum mechanics and conventional canonical formulations
of quantum gravity with a Schr¨odinger equation which describes ﬁrst-order evolution and time-ordering in global
intrinsic time.

II. CLASSICAL GR AND INTRINSIC TIME DEVELOPMENT

The super-Hamiltonian constraint factorizes in an interesting way as

√q
2κ

H = Gijkl ˜πij ˜πkl + V(qij ) = −(cid:0)β ˜π − ¯H(cid:1)(cid:0)β ˜π + ¯H(cid:1) = 0,

(2)

wherein ¯H = p ¯Gijkl ¯πij ¯πkl + V(qij ) = q 1
2 [¯qik ¯qjl + ¯qil ¯qjk] ¯πij ¯πkl + V(qij). This constrains ¯H = ±β ˜π. In Einstein’s
theory when V = − q
2 , the constraints form a ﬁrst class algebra; and the lapse function,
N , which is a Lagrange multiplier, is a priori an arbitrary function. But the physical meaning of N is revealed a
posteriori by the equations of motion (EOM) and constraints. In particular, the lapse function is related to ∂t ln q
and ¯H (which assumes the role of Hamiltonian density in intrinsic time geometrodynamics) through

(2κ)2 [R − 2Λeﬀ.] and l = 1

Dispensing with the Hamiltonian constraint, the EOM of the physical degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) (which lie in the
transverse traceless excitations of (¯qij , ¯πij)) can equivalently be captured by the non-trivial Hamiltonian, HADM :=

(4)

This ﬁnal step can be reached bearing in mind

√q
2κ H = ¯H 2 − β2˜π2 and ˜π commutes with (¯qij , ¯πij ). This is thus equiv-
alent to the evolution generated through conventional R ∓N (y){¯qij(x), H(y)}P.B. d3y with the a posteriori relation
(3) between N, ∂t ln q and ¯H. The ∓ sign accompanying N does not aﬀect the resultant classical ADM four-metric
which depends on the square of N . The EOM for ¯πij can be similarly demonstrated. Adding R N i(y)Hi(y)d3y to the
Hamiltonian merely leads to modiﬁcation of the EOM by Lie derivatives of the variables w.r.t. N i, with the resultant
lapse function (3) generalized to[14]

N =

.

(5)

In fact this ensures the Hamiltonian constraint is satisﬁed classically in the form K 2
¯H 2. Thus the Hamiltonian
HADM , which is no longer constrained to vanish, equivalently captures the physical content and EOM of Einstein’s
theory. This framework however allows the potential V to depart from that of Einstein’s theory without leading to
inconsistencies in the constraint algebra.

eminently more meaningful to ask how the wave function of the universe, Ψ, changes w.r.t to 3dDI global intrinsic
time variable T . With T displacing the physically less concrete ADM coordinate time t in HADM , this dynamics is

The formalism is applicable to the full theory of quantum gravity[8, 10], and assumptions of mini-superpsace models
have not been invoked. β > 0 is required for the Hamiltonian to be bounded from below, and global intrinsic time
increases monotonically with our ever expanding universe.

In this framework dictated by ﬁrst-order Schr¨odinger evolution in global intrinsic time, the Hamiltonian HPhys

is 3dDI provided ¯H = p¯πij ¯Gijkl ¯πkl + V is a scalar density of weight one; and Einstein’s GR (with its particular
value of β and V ) is a particular realization of this wider class of theories. The crucial time development operator
can be derived by integrating the Schr¨odinger equation, yielding Ψ(T ) = U (T, T0)Ψ(T0), with T -ordered operator
U (T, T0) := T exph− i

Unitary and diﬀeomorphism-invariant U (T, T0) follows if the 3dDI HPhys is self-adjoint. Since dT is also unchanged
under spatial diﬀeomorphisms, the temporal ordering in U (T, T0) will be reassuringly gauge invariant. Time-ordered
integrability of the Schr¨odinger equation is feasible without ambiguity because δT is ‘1-dimensional’, more precisely,
spatially-independent rather than many-ﬁngered, and HPhys is a spatial integral, rather than a local Hamiltonian
density. Moreover, the necessity of ‘time’-ordering, which underpins the notion of causality, emerges, because quantum
ﬁelds and the Hamiltonian do not commute at diﬀerent ‘times’[16]. What is paramount to causality is not the
dimension of time, but the sequence, or time-ordered development, of the physical state.

Wheeler’s provocative call to forgo all time-ordering may ring true intuitively, but it does not hold up to deeper
scrutiny. While space-time events and their ordering have no primary role and space-time itself is an entity ‘of limited
applicability’ in quantum gravity, the fundamental gauge-invariant entity that can be, and is in fact, time-ordered is
the physical quantum state.

IV. MODIFICATION OF THE POTENTIAL, AND ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR OF THE

HAMILTONIAN AT EARLY AND LATE INTRINSIC TIMES

Paradigm shift from 4-covariance to 3dDI (or spatial covariance), not only allows a resolution of the ‘problem of
time’, but it also permits the introduction of higher spatial derivative terms[3] in the potential V in ¯H to improve

convergence without sacriﬁcing unitarity. Since ¯H is a square root, this suggests a positive semi-deﬁnite weight two
potential[6, 8],

(intrinsic)time-dependent, and not (intrinsic)time-reversal invariant; furthermore, the exponential scaling behavior of
q with intrinsic time implies in the limit T−Tnow → −∞, V /Vnow → 0 (i.e. early times when the universe was very small
in volume), the potential V was dominated by the Cotton-York term; whereas the limit T − Tnow → ∞, V /Vnow → ∞
(i.e.
late times when the universe becomes large) will be dominated by the cosmological constant term, which is
compatible with current observations and understanding of our ever expanding universe[17]. In the middle period,
curvature and cosmological terms will be comparable in importance.

V. MOMENTRIC VARIABLE, AND THE FREE THEORY

The Poisson brackets for the (¯qij , ¯πij ) variables are,

{¯qij(x), ¯qkl(y)}P.B. = 0,

{¯qkl(x), ¯πij (y)}P.B. = P ij

functional diﬀerentiation can be traded for its well deﬁned action as generators of SU (3) on states expanded in this
basis. In addition, the ground state of the free theory, |0i, is thus an SU (3) singlet state which is annihilated by all
the momentric operators (i.e. T A|0i = 0).

VI. EARLY UNIVERSE AND COTTON-YORK DOMINANCE

As explained, early global intrinsic times and small volumes correspond to the era of Cotton-York dominance of V
at the beginning of the universe, wherein ¯H = q¯π†j

and regulate the Hamiltonian: the traceless Cotton-York tensor density is expressible as ˜Ci

Ricci curvature terms become increasingly important in the potential after the initial era of Cotton-York domi-
nance. They can be introduced in a manner which preserves the underlying structure which regulate the Hamil-
tonian by extending the Chern-Simons action with 3dDI invariants of the spatial metric. This not only guaran-
tees 3dDI invariance; but also makes the Hamiltonian density the square-root of a positive semi-deﬁnite and self-
adjoint object Q†i
i ; and ensures the preservation of all these properties even under renormalization of the cou-

pling constants. In increasing order of spatial derivatives, these invariants are ΛR √qd3x, EH = bR √qRd3x, and

the Chern-Simons functional of the aﬃne connection with dimensionless coupling constant. Even higher derivative
curvature invariants will come along with super-renormalizable dimensional coupling constants, while the cosmo-
logical constant volume term commutes with ¯πi
j(mn). To wit, only the Einstein-
Hilbert (EH) action in three dimensions and the Chern-Simons functional are relevant. This corresponds to adopting

theory, which is the spatial Ricci scalar and a (positive) c-number cosmological constant term, emerges. This means
that, instead of the naive positive semi-deﬁnite form with V as in (9), the simple and elegant quantum Hamiltonian
density qQ†i
i (with all its aforementioned advantages) already contains Einstein’s GR with cosmological constant.

in the higher-curvature higher-derivative combination (g ˜Cj

automatically absent in homogeneous FLRW cosmology, and also in constant curvature slicings of Painlev´e-Gullstrand
solutions of black holes[13]. Consequently, except for Cotton-York preponderance at very early times[19], Einstein’s
GR dominates at low curvatures and long wavelengths in a theory in which ‘four-dimensional symmetry is not a
fundamental property of the physical world’[2].

[14] The determinant of the ADM metric is equal to N q, so the lapse is non-vanishing unless there is degeneracy. In, for
instance, Minkowski space-time, both the numerator and denominator vanish, but we should consider instead de Sitter
space-time with compact slicings, and N is well-deﬁned in the limit of vanishing positive cosmological constant.
