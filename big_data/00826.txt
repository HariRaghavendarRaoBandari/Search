Radiation from an emitter in the ghost free scalar theory

Valeri P. Frolov and Andrei Zelnikov

Theoretical Physics Institute, Department of Physics

University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada T6G 2E1

We study radiation emitted by a time-dependent source of a scalar massless ﬁeld

in the framework of the ghost-free modiﬁcations of the theory. We consider a simple

model of the emitter: namely,we assume that it is point-like and monochromatic. We

focused on the most common versions of the ghost-free theory, where the propagator
(cid:3)−1 is modiﬁed as follows exp(−((cid:3)/µ2)N )(cid:3)−1, where µ is the characteristic mass-

scale of such GFN -theory. We demonstrated that far from the source, in the wave-
zone, the radiation asymptotically converges to its ”classical” value for any N ≥

1. However, in the near-zone the behavior of the ﬁeld is quite diﬀerent from the

”classical” case. The diﬀerence of ﬁeld amplitude for the ghost-free ﬁeld and for the

classical one has an oscillatory behavior in this domain. A number of oscillations

increases with N . The amplitude of these oscillations remain ﬁnite for even N , while

it inﬁnitely grows with frequency for odd N . This behavior indicates that even in

the classical domain GFN theories might have pathological behavior.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A well known problem of the General Relativity is its ultra-violet (UV) incompleteness.

In the classical theory it manifests itself as existence of singularities (see e.g.

[1]).

In a

quantum regime the General Relativity is non-renormalizable. It is expected that both of the

problems can be ”cured” by admitting higher in curvature terms the the gravitational action

[2–6]. However, such higher-derivative theories inevitably has a common severe problem:

they contain ghosts [7].

In a general case, this additional unphysical degrees of freedom

with negative energy result in classical and quantum instability of the theory [8–10]. The

2

problem of ghosts can be solved if one allows an inﬁnite number of derivatives in the action

of the ﬁeld, that makes it non-local. This can be achieved by a special modiﬁcation of the
standard propagator. Suppose one considers a scalar theory with the propagator ((cid:3)− m2)−1
and modiﬁes it as follows [a((cid:3))((cid:3) − m2)]−1, where a(z) is a entire function of the complex
variable z, which does not have poles in the complex plane of z. For such a modiﬁcation

the propagator has only one pole, which describes a particle with mass m. Such ghost-

free theories were widely discussed mainly in connection of the well known problem of

singularities in gravity (see, e.g. [11–17]). Their application to the problems of cosmology

[18–21] and black holes can be found in [22–28].

The simplest choice of the form-factor a(z), which is usually adopted in the publications,

is

a(z) = exp[(z/µ2)N ] .

(1.1)

We shall use the notation GFN for such a theory. The mass µ determines the energy scale
where ghost-free modiﬁcation of the theory becomes important. In the limit µ → ∞ one
has a(0) = 1, so that the theory reproduces correctly the results of the standard theory.

There are several papers discussing the gravitational ﬁeld of a point-mass in the linearized

version of the ghost-free gravity [29–34]. The main conclusion is that the gravitational

potential in the ghost-free modiﬁed theory is ﬁnite and regular at the location of the point

mass, while at far distance it converges to the standard Newtonian potential. This result is

valid for any value of N . At the same time one can expect that theories with odd value of N

may have ”bad” behavior for time-dependent sources. The reason for this is the following.
In a static case (cid:3) reduces to the Laplace operator (cid:52). The operator −(cid:52) is non-negative
In the general time-dependent case, the (cid:3) operator
deﬁnite as well as any power of it.
has both positive and negative eigen-values, which for odd N may lead to instability. The

purpose of this paper is to analyze behavior of radiation emitted by a time- dependent source

in the ghost-free theory with diﬀerent values of N .

II. SCALAR FIELD FROM A MONOPOLE EMITTER

We restrict ourselves by considering a ghost-free scalar ﬁeld in four dimensional spacetime

and use a simple model of a monopole point-like emitter. These restrictions play mainly

technical role and the obtained results can be generalized to the case of the ghost-free ﬁelds

with non-zero spin in higher dimensions. Similarly, the model of the emitter can be modiﬁed.

Our starting point is the action

(2.1)

where the entire function a(z) is given by (1.1). The corresponding ﬁeld equation reads

a((cid:3))((cid:3) − m2)ϕ = −4πj .

(2.2)

For simplicity we consider a massless case m = 0. We assume that the source of the ﬁeld ϕ is

point-like and its scalar charge oscillates with the frequency Ω. The equation (2.2) is linear
and its coeﬃcients are real. It is convenient to choose its source j in the form j = Re ˆj,

where

ˆj(x) = q eiΩtδ(x),

x = (t, x) .

(2.3)

After performing the calculations and getting the complex ﬁeld ˆϕ created by this complex

source (2.3) one can obtain the value of the ﬁeld ϕ by taking the real part of this complex

answer. The complex scalar ﬁeld ˆϕ created by the charge can be expressed in terms of the
retarded Green function GRet(x, x(cid:48))

To obtain the last relation we used the fact that the integrand in (2.10) is an even function

of p. In the last two lines we used a notation −(cid:82) to indicate that the corresponding integral

should be calculated according to the principal value prescription. In the limit µ = ∞ the
GFN theories reduce to the ordinary massless scalar theory, satisfying the ﬁeld equation

(cid:3) ˆϕ0(t, x) = −4πˆj.

For all N ≥ 1 the function f (p) is ﬁnite at p = Ω and, hence, the principal value integral
reduces to the ordinary one. f (p) ∈ C∞ is a smooth function on the interval [−∞,∞]
decreasing at inﬁnity as p−1 and satisfying the condition f (−p) = −f (p). Using these
properties one can estimate an asymptotic of the function h(Ω, r) at large r. Note that this

function has the form of the Fourier transform of f (p)

One can show (see, e.g., [36] page 91, Eq.(1.10)) that at large distances r (cid:29) µ−1

Because of the symmetry property f (−p) = −f (p) all even derivatives of ∂2l
p f (p) vanish at
p = 0. As the result of (2.19) and this property, h(Ω, r) falls oﬀ at large r faster than any

power of 1/r. This means that for all GFN theories the nonlocal eﬀects become important
only at distances from the charge of the order of µ−1. At large distances r (cid:29) µ−1 only the

III. NONLOCAL EFFECTS IN GFN SCALAR THEORY

Consider an example of GF2 scalar theory in more detail. The ghost-free nonlocal con-

tributions to the massless scalar theory are described by the ﬁeld ψ. It describes standing

waves with the amplitude at large radii falling oﬀ faster than any power of 1/r. The ﬁeld

ψ (see (2.16)-(2.17)) is proportional to the dimensionless function h(Ω, r) which depends on

the dimensionless combinations Ω/µ and µr only. For various values of Ω the dependence of

h(Ω, r) on the radius is depicted in Figs.1-2. The potential created by a point source (2.3)

in the ghost-free models is

(cid:2)e−iΩr − h(Ω, r)(cid:3) .

ˆϕ(t, x) = −q eiΩt
r

(3.1)

Notice that in ghost-free models at small r the function h(Ω, r) = 1 + O(r) and the potential

is ﬁnite at r = 0 (see (2.21)). All GFN theories with even N look alike. For example,

h(Ω, r) in the case of GF4 theory is depicted in Fig.3

Now let us consider GFN theories of the odd order N . They also look similar to each

other. A typical example is GF1 scalar theory. It reveals the key properties of the whole

class of theories of the odd order. In this particular case one can compute the ﬁeld of the

oscillating monopole charge analytically. The function (2.17) takes the form of the Hilbert

transform (see [35])

(3.3)

For small frequencies Ω (cid:28) µ this function behaves similarly to that in the even N theories.
The crucial diﬀerence appears at Ω > µ (see Fig.4). Comparing this plot with Figs.1-2 one

can see that, while in all even N amplitude the nonlocal correction h(Ω, r) is always within
the interval [−1, 1], in the GF1 theory near r ∼ µ−1 it exponentially grows with growing Ω.
This behavior can be derived from the asymptotic of the error function erf of a complex
argument. At Ω (cid:29) µ2r we can use the asymptotic expansion of the erf function for a

Thus, at any ﬁnite r ∼ µ−1 and large frequencies, the nonlocal corrections to the ordinary

bility for the ﬁeld of time-dependent sources in GF1 theory. This instability is an inherent

property of all GFN with odd N .

8

Ghost-free models have been intensively discussed recently. The ghost-free modiﬁcation

of the gravity improves its UV behavior both in the classical and quantum domains. This

open an interesting possibility that the long-standing problems of the General relativity, its

black-hole and cosmological singularities, can be resolve in the framework of the properly

chosen ghost-free model. In this paper we study some properties of the ghost-free theories

with time-dependent sources of the ﬁeld. We made a number of simplifying assumptions.

Instead of the gravity, we consider a scalar massless ﬁeld, and we choose a simple model

of the time-dependent source: a point-like emitter of the monochromatic radiation. We

examined so called GFN models of the ghost-free theory. We obtained solutions for the

scalar ﬁeld in such a model and demonstrated that at far distance, in the wave zone, this
ﬁeld asymptotically converge to its ”classical” value. This happens for any N ≥ 1. However,
the structure of the ﬁeld in the near zone is qualitatively diﬀerent for odd and even values of

N . Namely, the ﬁeld remains bounded for even N , while for odd N its amplitude inﬁnitely

grows with the frequency of the emitter. This result supports a conclusion that all GFN

theories with odd N have a potential problem: their solutions may be unstable. This means

that one can expect similar pathology of such theories in a more general set-up.
