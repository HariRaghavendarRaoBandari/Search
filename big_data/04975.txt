EXISTENCE AND BV-REGULARITY FOR NEUTRON TRANSPORT

EQUATION IN NON-CONVEX DOMAIN

YAN GUO AND XIONGFENG YANG

Abstract. This paper considers the neutron transport equation in bounded domain with a
combination of the diﬀusive boundary condition and the in-ﬂow boundary condition. We
ﬁrstly study the existence of solution in any ﬁxed time by L2 − L∞ method, which was estab-
lished to study Boltzmann equation in [9]. Based on the uniform estimates of the solution,
we also consider the BV-regularity of the solution in non-convex domain. A cut-oﬀ function,
which aims to exclude all the characteristics emanating from the grazing set SB, has been
constructed precisely.

1. Introduction

The neutron transport equation is a type of radiative transport equation, which is a balance
statement that the neutrons conserved. This equation is commonly used to determine the
behavior of nuclear reactor cores and experimental or industrial neutron beams. For more
details, see [5]. In this paper, we consider the following neutron transport equation

∂u
∂t

(1.1)
The function u(t, x, v) represents a density of the number of particles. Σ(x, v) ≥ 0 describes
the eﬀective total cross section, which is a given positive function of x and v, the given
operator K is deﬁned as

+ v · ∇u + Σ(x, v)u = Ku + q(t, x, v).

(1.2)

k(x, v, v′)u(t, x, v′)dv′,

Ku(x, v) =ZV

The nonnegative kernel k(x, v, v′) models a transfer of a density of numbers of neutrons from
one speed to another. It depends on the state of the material at the point x, v, v′, and it is
isotropic if the kernel only depends on the variables v and v′. q(t, x, v) is a source of a ﬁnite
total number of neutrons at each moment t.

In bounded domain, the equation describes the evolution of a population of neutrons in a
domain Ω occupied by a medium which interacts with the neutrons. Here Ω be a bounded
open and connected subset of R3, ∂Ω is denoted as its boundary. The domain V is the velocity
space, which generally is the form V = {v ∈ R3| a ≤ |v| ≤ b} or a ﬁnite union of spheres.
There are extensive developments in the study of the neutron transport equation. The exis-
tence of the solution for both steady neutron transport equation and time-dependent neutron
transport equation have been studied in [7], [20], [21] by constructing a maximal and a min-
imal solutions. An abstract theorem is also established in [1]. The existence of the solution
for the neutron transport equation was constructed in the Banach spaces Lp, 1 ≤ p < ∞,

it means that L∞ solution has not been treated. For the asymptotic expansions in transport
theory, we refer to [2], [13], [14], [15] and [22]. Most of the above works considered the
neutron transport while the neutron ﬂux entering Ω at each point of ∂Ω is zero, that is, the
zero in-ﬂow boundary condition. Later, the existence of the neutron transport equation with
diﬀerent types of boundary condition has also appeared in [16], [17], [18], [19] and [24]
and referees therein. Moreover, the authors [3] had studied the existence and the asymptotic
expansion of the solution for neutron transport equation with in-ﬂow boundary condition
together with a weak diﬀusive boundary condition by the probabilistic theory. In [23], the
very recent result show the asymptotic expansion of the solution for the neutron transport
equation in 2-D unit disc, which gave a more precise approximation of the solution around
the boundary by modifying the Milne problem.

In the following, we list some assumptions on the phase space Ω × V. We assume that the
boundary ∂Ω is locally a graph of a given C2 function: for each point x0 ∈ ∂Ω, there exist
r > 0 and a C2 function η : R2 → R such that, up to a rotation and relabeling, we have
(1.3)
(1.4)
In this case, the outward normal direction n at x ∈ ∂Ω can be expressed as

∂X ∩ B(x0; r) = {x ∈ B(x0; r) : x3 = η(x1, x2)},
∂X ∩ B(x0; r) = {x ∈ B(x0; r) : x3 > η(x1, x2)}.

n(x1, x2) =

1

p1 + |∇xη(x1, x2)|2(cid:18)∂x1 η(x1, x2), ∂x2 η(x1, x2), 1(cid:19).

The domain Ω is called a strictly non-convex domain if there exists at least one point
x0 ∈ ∂Ω and nonzero u ∈ R2 such that (1.3)-(1.4) hold and
(1.5)

uiu j∂i∂ jη(x0) < 0.

Xi, j=1,2

The phase boundary in the phase space Ω × V is denoted as γ = ∂Ω × V, and we split it into
the outgoing boundary γ+, the incoming boundary γ−

, and the grazing boundary γ0

= {(x, v) ∈ ∂Ω × V : n(x) · v ≷ 0},
γ±
γ0 = {(x, v) ∈ ∂Ω × V : n(x) · v = 0}.
(resp γ0) are open subsets (resp. closed) of γ = ∂Ω × V such that

It is known that γ+ and γ−
(1.6)
In this paper, we assume that Ω is strictly non-convex domain, V is a bounded domain and it
can be locally expressed as (3.12).

γ = ∂Ω × V = γ+ ∪ γ0 ∪ γ−.

Let us explain the diﬃculty to study the regularity of the kinetic equation in bounded
domain with boundary condition.
It partly dues to the characteristic nature of boundary
conditions. To make it clear, we consider the transport equation with the given boundary
condition
(1.7)
Given (x, v) ∈ X, let [X(s), V(s)] = [X(s; t, x, v), V(s; t, x, v)] = [x − (t − s)v, v] be a trajectory
for the transport equation:

v · ∇x f (x, v) = 0,

f|Γ−

= g.

(1.8)

dX(s)

dV(s)

= 0,

with the initial condition [X(t; t, x, v), V(t; t, x, v)] = [x, v]. Then, we solve (1.7) as f (x, v) =
g(xb(x, v), v) = g(x − tb(x, v)v, v), where tb(x, v) ≥ 0 is the backward exit time, or the last

moment at which the back-time straight line [X(s; 0, x, v), V(s; t, x, v)] remains in the interior
of X. It is deﬁned as
(1.9)
The backward exit position on the boundary ∂X is
(1.10)
and we always have v· n(xb(x, v)) ≤ 0. Similarly the forward exit time tf and the forward exit
position are deﬁned as

xb(x, v) = x − tb(x, v)v,

(1.11)

tf(x, v) := sup(cid:0){0} ∩ {τ : x + sv ∈ X for all 0 < s < τ}(cid:1),

xf(x, v) = x + tf(x, v)v.

Generally, it is diﬃcult to determine tb, xb as well as the solution to (1.7) with the diﬀusive
boundary condition. This was solved by introducing the probability measure on the boundary
in [9].

SB := {(x, v) ∈ Ω × V : n(xb(x, v)) · v = n(x − tb(x, v)v) · v = 0},

There are a few results about the regularity of the solutions to the kinetic equation in
bounded domain. The ﬁrst one has been appeared in [8], Guo constructed the singular solu-
tions of the Vlasov-Maxwell equation on a half line. Recently, Guo [9] developed the L2−L∞
estimate for the solution of Boltzmann equation in convex domain with diﬀerent boundary
conditions, and it was show that the solution are continuous away from the grazing set γ0. It
should be pointed out that the domain needs not to be convex for the diﬀusive reﬂection con-
dition case. Later, the regularity of the solution for Boltzmann equation was studied in [10].
The authors established the C1 solution in convex domain and show that the solution should
not be C2. In the above two papers, it could be proved that xb(x, v) has singular behavior if
n(xb(x, v)) · v = 0, and the solution might be singular on the set:
(1.12)
which is the collection of all the characteristics emanating from the grazing set γ0. In a non-
convex domain, Kim [12] discovered that the singularity (discontinuity) of the solution of
Boltzmann equation always occurs, and such singularity propagates along the singular set
SB. More precisely, let the concave (singular) grazing boundary in the grazing boundary to
be deﬁned as
γS
(1.13)
0
It was proved that γS
the interior of the phase space Ω × V. So the discontinuity set of the solution in Ω × V is
(1.14)
It implies that we can not get the classical solution of Boltzmann equation. A nature problem
is the regularity of the solutions in non-convex domain. Very recently, the BV-regularity of
the solution to Boltzmann equation in non-convex domain has been studied in [11]. More-
over, it was proved that the singular set to the characteristics emanating from the strictly
non-convex points

= {(x, v) ∈ γ0 : tb(x, v) , 0 and tb(x, −v) , 0} ⊂ γ0.
0 is the only part at which discontinuity can be created or propagates into

D = γ0 ∪ {(x, v) ∈ Ω × V : (xb(x, v), v) ∈ γS
0}.

(cid:8)(x, v) ∈ SB : (xb(x, v), v) is a strictly non-convex point(cid:9)

is a co-dimension 1 submanifold of Ω × V. This means that the BV regularity is the best
regularity for Boltzmann equation in the non-convex domain.
Similarly, we expect to establish the existence and BV-regularity of the solution for the
neutron transport equation in non-convex domain. The large time behavior and the regularity

of the solution to the Neutron transport equation would be considered in forthcoming papers.
In this paper, we assume Ω is anon-convex domain and we consider

with the initial-boundary condition
(1.16)
Here r, u0 are given functions and Pγ is the diﬀusive reﬂection: for (x, v) ∈ γ−

it is a L2
deﬁned on γ+.

Before state the main results, we give some notations. We denote || · ||∞

The operator Pγ could be viewed as function on {v ∈ V : v· n(x) > 0} for any ﬁxed x ∈ ∂Ω,

the norm of
L∞(Ω × V), while || · ||p is the norm of the Lp(Ω × V). In particular, (·, ·) is the inner product
of the space L2(Ω × V). We also denote | · |p the norm of Lp(∂Ω × V, dS xdv) and | · |γ,p the
norm of Lp(∂Ω × V) = Lp(∂Ω × V, dγ) with dγ = |n(x) · v|dS xdv with the surface measure
dS x on ∂X. We write | · |γ±,p = | · Iγ±|γ,p. For a function on Ω × V, we denote fγ to be its trace
on γ whenever it exists. f . g means f = O(g).
We show that the L2 estimates of the solution for the neutron transport equation with
the mixing boundary condition can be obtained by the tracing theorem. These estimates
can be applied to achieve the estimates of the solution in L∞ norm by using the general
characteristics curves of the equation with the same boundary condition. Thus, we get the
existence of the solution for the neutron transport equation, which is stated as follows.

Theorem 1.1. Let Ω be a bounded open subset of R3 with C2 boundary ∂Ω as in (1.3)-(1.4).
Assume that ||u0||∞, sup0≤t≤T |r(t)|∞, sup0≤t≤T ||g(t)||∞
are bound for any ﬁxed T > 0. Suppose
further that there exist some constant Ma, Mb, for all (x, v) ∈ Ω × V, it holds
(1.18)
k(x, v, v′)dv′ ≤ Mb.

Then, there exists a unique solution u ∈ L∞([0, T ]; L∞(Ω × V)) of the problem (1.15) with
(1.16) such that

for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T.

Based on the uniform estimate of solution (1.19), we study the BV-regularity of the solu-
tions in non-convex domain. A function f ∈ L1(Ω × V) has bounded variation in Ω × V
if

For the estimate of BV norm of the solution, we should imposed some additional regularity

on the data. Let ∂ = (∂x, ∂v). For any ﬁxed T , we assume
(1.22)

+ |∂tr(t)|1 + |∂r(t)|1 + ||q(t)||BVi < ∞,
and there exist some constant M′a, M′b, it holds, for all (x, v) ∈ Ω × V

The second main result in this paper is the following.
Theorem 1.2. Let Ω is a non-convex domain with C2 boundary ∂Ω as in (1.3)-(1.4). Suppose
that all the conditions in Theorem 1.1 hold. Moreover, we assume that (1.22)-(1.23) hold.
Then, there exists a unique solution u ∈ L∞([0, T ]; BV(Ω × V)) of the problem (1.15) with

Since the boundary operator associated with the diﬀusive condition is of norm exactly
one, the standard theory of transport equation in bounded domains [1] fails. The ideas of the
proof of Theorem 1.1 is similar to that in [9] and [6]. Here, we replace the original unknown
function u with et U = eλtu for any ﬁxed time T . It is more convenient because there is a
diﬀusion term λU in the equation. To prove the existence of the solution, we ﬁrst study the
equation about U with a reduced diﬀusive reﬂection boundary condition, which is set up to
establish a contracting map argument. Then, we take the limit and get the solution based on
the uniformly estimates of the sequence. In this paper, we give a more precise estimate of
the sequence Um (see Lemma 2.6), it can be easily applied to both the bound of the sequence
and its convergence.

We now illustrate the main ideas of the proof of Theorem 1.2, which is similar to that in

[11]. For simplicity, we assume that u satisﬁes the following simpler problem

∂tu + v · ∇xu + Σu = H,

u|t=0 = u0,

u|γ−

= Pγu + r,

and where Σ ≥ 0, H and r are smooth enough. In general, solutions u are discontinuous
on SB and (distributional) derivatives do not exist. In order to take derivatives, we construct
some smooth cut-oﬀ function χε(x, v) vanishing on an open neighborhood of SB and consider
the following problem

∂tuε + v · ∇xuε + Σuε = χεH,
= χεPγuε + χεr.

uε|γ−

u|t=0 = χεu0,

Due to the cut-oﬀ χε, the solution of uε vanishes on some open subset of Ω × V containing
the singular set SB. Therefore uε is smooth and we can apply (distributional) derivatives ∂
to the approximation equation. Once we can show that uε is uniformly bounded in L∞ and
∂uε is uniformly bounded in L1(Ω × V), then we conclude that uε converges to the solution u
weak-∗ in L∞ and BV.
So, we should ﬁrstly construct the smooth cut-oﬀ function χε such that it vanished on an
open neighborhood Oε,ε1 of SB. we can show that Oε,ε1 contains all points whose distance
from SB is less than ε. Such ε thickness is important for constructing cut-oﬀ functions.

Secondly, we should control the outgoing term for the estimate of the derivatives. For this
purpose, we split the outgoing boundary γ+ into the (outgoing) almost grazing set
(1.25)
and the (outgoing) non-grazing set

The plan of this paper is the following: In section 2, we obtain the solution U with a
reduced diﬀusive reﬂection boundary condition. Based on the uniformly estimates of the
approximation solution in L2, we take the limit and get the solution of the neutron transport
equation. For the uniform bound of the approximation solution, we follows the abstract
scheme appeared in [6]. Here we give a new estimate in Lemma 2.6 which can be applied to
obtain both the bound of the sequence and its convergence. In section 3, we ﬁrstly construct
the desired ε- neighborhood of the singular set and its smooth cut-oﬀ functions χε. Then, we
analyse the estimates of χε and their derivatives in the bulk and on the boundary. Moreover,
the new trace theorem is achieved by using double iteration, and we give the estimates of
the approximation sequence uε,m in L∞ and its derivatives in L1(Ω × V). At last, some useful
geometric results will be listed in Section 4.

In this section, we consider the existence of the solution to (1.15) with the boundary con-

2.1. L2 estimates of the solution. In order to prove Proposition 2.3, we need to study the L2
of the solution to (2.2). The estimate are obtained from the following two lemmas. Firstly,
we start with the existence of the solution to the simple transport equation. Secondly, we
construct the solution to (2.2) by assuming λ is suﬃciently large.

Here tb(x, v) and xb are deﬁned in (1.9)-(1.10). We then show that U(t, x, v) is a weak solution
of (2.4) in the sense of distributions.

Now, we will establish the L2 estimate of the solution of (2.4). Multiplying (2.4) with U

In the next lemma, we ﬁrstly study the solution of (2.2) with a reduced diﬀusive reﬂection
boundary condition, which is necessary to establish a contracting map argument. Then, we
take the limit and get the solution based on the uniformly estimates of the sequence.

2.2. L∞ estimate of the solution. We would study the uniform L∞ estimates of the solution
for the problem (2.2). To bootstrap L2 estimate into L∞ estimate, we need to deﬁne the
stochastic cycles for the generalized characteristic lines interacted with the boundary. This
method was ﬁrstly introduced by Guo in [9], which is a canonical way to treat L∞ estimate
of the solution to Boltzmann equation with diﬀusive boundary condition. In the following,
we construct the stochastic cycles for neutron transport equation with diﬀusive boundary
condition, which is similar to that for Boltzmann equation in [9] and [6]. Then, we show L∞
estimate of the solution to the neutron transport equation (2.2) by this stochastic cycles.
Let V(x) = {v′ ∈ D : v′ · n(x) > 0}, the probability measure dσ = dσ(x) is given by

(2.28)

dσ(x) = c{n(x) · v′}dv′, with cZV(x)

And the stochastic cycle is deﬁned as

of the solution U of (2.2) and the estimate (2.3) come from Lemma 2.7 immediately. It is
exactly the result of Proposition 2.3. Form Proposition 2.2, the solution u of (1.15)-(1.16)

3. BV regularity of solution

In this section, we construct an open covering of the singular set SB, which is crucial
to establish a smooth approximation function that excludes the open covering of SB.
In
particular, the measure of this singular set could be suﬃciently small from Lemma 3.1 and
Proposition 3.1.

3.1. The neighborhood of singular set. In the following, we construct the neighborhoods
of the singular set, which is similar to the Boltzmann equation constructed in [11]. For the
completeness of this paper, we present the details here.
Lemma 3.1. For 0 ≤ ε ≤ ε1 ≪ 1, we construct an open set Oε,ε1 ⊂ Ω × V such that

There exists C

Proof. Construction of Oε,ε1.
Step 1. Decomposition of ∂Ω Let us ﬁx θ > 0 which will be chosen later. Since the
boundary ∂Ω is locally a graph of smooth functions, from the ﬁnite covering theorem, there
exists a ﬁnite number MΩ,θ of small open balls U1, U2, · · · , UMΩ,θ ⊂ R3 with diam(Um) < 2
for all m, such that

(3.5)

∂Ω ⊂

MΩ,θ[m=1

[Um ∩ ∂Ω] with MΩ,θ = O(θ−2),

and for every m, inside Um the boundary Um ∩ ∂Ω is exactly described by a smooth function
ηm deﬁned on a (small) open set Am ⊂ R2. Up to rotations and translations and reducing the
size of the ball Um) we will always assume that
(3.6)
(3.7)

Um ∩ ∂Ω = {(x1, x2, ηm(x1, x2)) ∈ Am × R},
Um ∩ Ω = {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ Am × R : x3 > ηm(x1, x2)}

with

(0, 0) ∈ Am ⊂ [−θ, θ] × [−θ, θ], ∂1ηm(0, 0) = ∂2ηm(0, 0) = 0.

Therefore, the unit out normal vector at (0, 0, ηm(0, 0)) is

n(0, 0, ηm(0, 0)) =

(∂1ηm(0, 0), ∂2ηm(0, 0), −1)

Then we deﬁne the (i, j)-rectangular Rm,i, j,ε,ε1 which is centered at cm,i, j,ε and whose side is

Note that if ε1 ≥ ε then εi − ε1 is an open covering of Am, i.e.

Rm,i, j,ε,ε1 with Nε = O(ε−1θ).
For each rectangle we deﬁne the representative outward normal

Let ( ˆx1,m,i, j,ε, ˆx2,m,i, j,ε) ∈ S2 be an orthonormal basis of the tangent space of ∂Ω at (cm,i, j,ε, ηm(cm,i, j,ε).
Remark that the three vectors ( ˆx1,m,i, j,ε, ˆx2,m,i, j,ε, nm,i, j,ε) is an orthonormal basis of R3 for each
m, i, j, ε.

Step 2. Decomposition of Ω×V We split the tangent velocity space at (cm,i, j,ε, ηm(cm,i, j,ε)) ∈

We denote that Om,i, j,ε,ε1,l is an inﬁnite union of open sets and hence is an open set. Finally,
we deﬁne

(3.16)

Oε,ε1 := [m,i, j,l Om,i, j,ε,ε1,l [ nR3 × BR3(0, ε1)o ,

where 1 ≤ m ≤ MΩ,δ = O(θ−2), −Nε ≤ i, j ≤ Nε = O(θε−1) and 0 ≤ l ≤ Lε = O(ε−1). Since
Oε,ε1 is a union of open sets, it is also an open set.

With the covering set Oε,ε1 on hand, we now prove the properties.
Proof of (3.1). Suppose there exists (x, v) ∈ SB, by the deﬁnition of SB in (1.12 ), there
exists y = xb(x, v) ∈ ∂Ω such that x = y + tb(x, v)v and v · n(y) = 0 from (1.9) and (1.10).
Then y ∈ Um for some m, that is, y = (y1, y2, ηm(y1, y2)) and (y1, y2) ∈ Rm,i, j,ε,ε1 for some i, j.

Firstly, for any |v| ≥ 1, we check that

(3.17)

where we denoted ∇ηm(y1, y2) = (∂y1 ηm(y1, y2), ∂2ηm(y1, y2)) and used the fact that

p1 + |∇ηm(cm,i, j,ε)|2

Using (3.8), for (y1, y2) ∈ Rm,i, j,ε,ε1, we have
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)nm,i, j,ε ·

|v|(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 2||ηm||C2(Rm,i, j,ε,ε1 )|cm,i, j,ε − (y1, y2)|

Secondly, we consider the case |v| ≤ 1. From (3.8) and the similar estimates of |v| ≥ 1 case ,
we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)nm,i, j,ε · v(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ |n(y) · v| + |(n(y1, y2) − nm,i, j,ε) · v|

there exists some x ∈ Xm,i, j,ε,ε1,l satisﬁes |y−x| ≤ ε1. So, we derive that |z−x| ≤ |z−y|+|y−x| ≤

τ ∈ [0, t f(cid:0)(x1, x2, ηm(x1, x2)), cos θe1 + sin θe2(cid:1)], s ∈ (−ε1, ε1)o.

Let diam(Ω) = supx,y∈Ω |x − y| < +∞. Since || cos θe1 + sin θe2|| = 1, the exit time t f satisﬁes

t f(cid:0)(x1, x2, ηm(x1, x2)), cos θe1 + sin θe2(cid:1) ≤ diam(Ω).

From the deﬁnition ofSx∈Xm,i, j,ε,ε1 ,l BR3(x; ε1), we can check that it is included in the truncated

In the following, we ﬁrstly prove that (A) ≥ ε. Let v ∈ (Θm,i, j,ε,C∗ε,l)c \ BR3(0; C
it could be rewritten as

Deﬁnition 3.1. We deﬁne a smooth cut-oﬀ function χε : Ω × V → [0, 2] as

The following properties of the cut-oﬀ function are crucial for our analysis.
Proposition 3.1. There exist ˜C ≫ C
that if 0 ≤ ε ≤ ε0, then
(3.30)

"Ω×V |∂χε(x, v)|dvdx . 1.

Proof. This Proposition will be proved by the deﬁnition of the cut-oﬀ function χε directly.
Proof of (3.30). Let (x, v) ∈ SB. Due to (3.28) if |(x, v) − (y, u)| ≥ ε/ ˜C then ψε(x, v) = 0.
Therefore, (3.29) can be rewritten as

χε(x, v) = "BR6 ((x,v);ε/ ˜C)

1Ω×V\Oε,C∗ ε

(y, u)ψε(x − y, v − u)dydu

On the other hand, if (y, u) ∈ BR6((x, v); ε/ ˜C), duo to (3.1)-(3.2) with ε1 = ε and ˜C ≫ C
we have (y, u) ∈ Oε,ε ⊂ Oε,C∗ε and

∗ ≫ 1,

1Ω×V\Oε,C∗ ε

(y, u) = 0.

Therefore, we conclude that χε(x, v) = 0 for all SB and (3.30) is true.

The following fact is crucial to prove Proposition 3.2 and especially (3.34). The proof is

similar to that in [11].
Lemma 3.2. We ﬁx m0 = 1, 2, · · · , MΩ,θ in (3.5). We may assume (up to rotations and
translations) there exists a C2 function ηm0
: [−θ, θ] × [−θ, θ] → R, whose graph is the

(i0, j0) = (0, 0)

and ηm0(0, 0) = 0 and ∇ηm0(0, 0) = 0.

Consider the case of |v| ≥ ε1/3. Since(cid:0)(x1, x2, ηm0(x1, x2)−y, v)(cid:1) ∈ Oε,C∗ε we use the deﬁnition

The proof of this proposition requires the following lemma:

Lemma 3.3. Let Ω ⊂ R3 be an open bounded set with a smooth boundary ∂Ω. For k ∈ N,
consider the map

Φk : {(x, v) ∈ γ+ : n(xb(x, v)) · v < −1/k} → {(xb, v) ∈ γ−

: n(xb) · v < −1/k},
(x, v) → Φk(x, v) := ( ˜x, v) := (xb(x, v), v).

38

Y. GUO AND X.F. YANG

Then Φkis one-to-one and we have a change of variables formula for all k ∈ N :

{n( ˜x)·v<−1/k}|n( ˜x) · v|dS ˜xdv = 1

{n(xb(x,v)·v<−1/k)}|n(x) · v|dS xdv.

Proof of lemma 3.3: This lemma deals with the change of variable formula: (x, v) →

(xb(x,v), v). The proof is the same as in [11]. We omit it here.

Clearly the last term (B) is bounded by the RHS of (3.55).

We focus on (A) in the following. We split the outgoing part as γ+ = γδ

the almost grazing set γδ
(1.26). Due to Lemma 4.2, the non-grazing part γ+ \ γδ

+ is deﬁned in (1.25) and the non-grazing set γ+ \ γδ

It is also bounded by the RHS of (3.55).

Now, we deal with the almost grazing set γδ

with a number k ∈ N is uniformly bounded in k as follows:

Estimate of (3.58): Note that x ∈ ∂Ω in (3.58). Without loss of generality we may assume
that there exists η : R2 → R such that x3 = η(x1, x2). We apply the following change of

Let us denote ˜x := xb(x, v). In the case n3(xb(x, v)) , 0, there exists some function φ : R2 →
R such that

˜x = xb(x, v) = ( ˜x1, ˜x2, ˜x3) = ( ˜x1, ˜x2, φ( ˜x1, ˜x2)) ∈ ∂Ω.

Note that since (x, v) ∈ γ+ and |n(xb(x, v)) · v| > 1/k, from Lemma 3.3, the mapping (x, v) 7→
( ˜x, v) is one-to-one. We apply the change of variables of Lemma 3.3: for (x, v) ∈ γ+ and
|n(xb(x, v)) · v| = |n( ˜x) · v| > 1/k, we apply the change of variables
(3.67)

(x, v) 7→ ( ˜x, v) := (xb(x, v), v).

The Jacobian is

∂x! =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
∂(x, v)! = det  ∂ ˜x

3.4. Estimates of the total variation. The purpose of this subsection is to prove Theorem
2. To give the estimate of solution in total variation, we use following approximation scheme.
For u0 ∈ BV(Ω × V) and ||u0||∞ < ∞ we choose uε
0 ∈ BV(Ω × V) ∩ C∞(Ω × V) satisfying
||[ˆu0 − u0]||∞ → 0 and ||∇x,v ˆu0||1 → ||u0||fBV. At the same time, for ﬁxed 0 ≤ t ≤ T , we choose
ˆq ∈ BV(Ω × V) ∩ C∞(Ω × V) satisfying ||[ˆq − q]||∞ → 0 and ||∇x,v ˆq||1 → ||q||fBV.
Consider the sequence uε,m deﬁned by uε,0 = χεu0 and for all m ≥ 0,
in Ω × V,
in Ω × V,

uε,m+1(0, x, v) = χε ˆu0(x, v),

where χε is deﬁned in (3.29).

In order to study the derives of uε,m+1(t, x, v) with respect to x, v, we need to consider the
derivatives on the boundary. For the purpose of it, we assume that u satisﬁes the following
neutron transport equation with the diﬀusive-inﬂow boundary condition

(∂t + v · ∇x + (Σ − K))u = q,

u|γ−

= Pγu + r.

Let τ1(x), τ2(x) be a basis of the tangent space at x ∈ ∂Ω (therefore τ1(x), τ2(x), n(x) is an
orthonormal basis of R3), i.e. τ1(x) · n(x) = τ2 · n(x) = 0 and τ1 × τ2 = n(x). Deﬁne the
orthonormal transformation from n(x), τ1, τ2 to the standard bases (e1, e2, e3), i.e. T n(x) = e1,
T τ1(x) = e2, T τ2 = e2 and T −1 = T t. Upon a change of variable: ξ = T v′, we have
(3.73)

n(x) · v′ = n(x) · T tξ = n(x) · n(x)tT tξ = [T n(x)]tξ = e1 · ξ = ξ1,

then denote ∂τi to be the (tangential) τi-directional derivative and ∂n to be the normal deriv-
ative. For all (x, v) ∈ γ−

∇xu and ∇vu lie in L∞([0, T ]; L1(Ω × R3)), this allows us to apply Lemma 4.2 to compute
the traces on the incoming boundary in L1([0, T ]; L1(γ−, dγ)) (by taking limits of the ﬂow

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.2. We ﬁrstly consider the bound in ||·||∞
of the solution for the approxi-
mation scheme (3.72). For a ﬁxed 0 < ε ≪ 1, it is clear that (uε,m)m is a Cauchy series for the
for ﬁxed 0 < T from Theorem 1.1. More precisely, the sequence (uε,m)m

||uε,m||∞ .T,Ω,V ||u0||∞

+ sup

0≤s≤T |r(s)|∞

0≤s≤T ||q(s)||∞.

Therefore uε,m → uε up to subsequence for the norm sup0tT || · ||∞
and uε satisﬁes (3.72) with
both uε,m+1 and uε,m replaced by uε by the Green theorem. Since |χε| ≤ 1 for 0 < ε ≪ 1,
sup0≤t≤T ||uε||∞
is uniformly bounded in ε for ﬁxed T . Therefore uε → u weak −∗ up to a
subsequence and the limiting function u solves the original neutron transport equation in the
sense of distributions.

has

Secondly, we consider the derivatives of the solution uε,m of (3.72). Recall that BV(Ω× V)
i) a compactness property: Suppose gk ∈ BV and supk||gk||BV < ∞, then there exists
ii) a lower semicontinuity property: Suppose gk ∈ BV and gk → g in L1
loc then ||g|| ˜BV ≤

g ∈ BV with gk → g in L1 up to subsequence,
lim infk→∞ ||gk|| ˜BV.

Due to the smooth approximation ˆu0 of the initial datum u0 and the cut-oﬀ χε, uε,m is

smooth by Lemma 3.4. On one hand, by Lemma 3.4 with Σ ≥ 0,

On the other hand, by taking derivatives ∂ ∈ {∇x, ∇v} to (3.72), we have
[∂t + v · ∇x + Σ](∇xuε,m+1) = −∇xΣ uε,m+1 + ∇x(χεKuε,m + χε ˆq)
[∂t + v · ∇x + Σ](∇vuε,m+1) = −(cid:16)∇x + ∇vΣ(cid:17)uε,m+1 + ∇v(χεKuε,m + χε ˆq)
