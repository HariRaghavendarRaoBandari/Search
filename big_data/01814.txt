Abstract

Graphene/h-BN has emerged as a model van der Waals heterostructure [1], and

the band structure engineering by the superlattice potential has led to various novel

quantum phenomena including the self-similar Hofstadter butterﬂy states [2–5]. Al-

though newly generated second generation Dirac cones (SDCs) are believed to be

crucial for understanding such intriguing phenomena, so far fundamental knowledge

of SDCs in such heterostructure, e.g. locations and dispersion of SDCs, the eﬀect of

inversion symmetry breaking on the gap opening, still remains highly debated due

to the lack of direct experimental results. Here we report ﬁrst direct experimental
results on the dispersion of SDCs in 0◦ aligned graphene/h-BN heterostructure using

angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our data reveal unambiguously SDCs at

the corners of the superlattice Brillouin zone, and at only one of the two superlattice
valleys. Moreover, gaps of ≈ 100 meV and ≈ 160 meV are observed at the SDCs

and the original graphene Dirac cone respectively. Our work highlights the important

role of a strong inversion symmetry breaking perturbation potential in the physics of

graphene/h-BN, and ﬁlls critical knowledge gaps in the band structure engineering of

Dirac fermions by a superlattice potential.

Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) shares similar honeycomb lattice structure to graphene,

yet its lattice is stretched by 1.8%. Moreover, the breaking of the inversion symmetry by

distinct boron and nitrogen sublattices leads to a large band gap (5.97 eV) in the π band,

which is in sharp contrast to the gapless Dirac cones in graphene. By stacking graphene

atop h-BN to form a van der Waals heterostructure [1], graphene/h-BN not only exhibits

greatly improved properties for device applications, such as reduced ripples, suppressed

charge inhomogeneities and higher mobility [6, 7], but also provides unique opportunities for

band structure engineering of Dirac fermions by a periodic potential [8, 9]. The superlattice

potential induced by the lattice mismatch and crystal orientation can signiﬁcantly modify

the electronic properties of graphene and lead to various novel quantum phenomena, e.g.

emergence of second generation Dirac cones (SDCs) which are crucial for the realization of

Hofstadter butterﬂy states under applied magnetic ﬁeld [2–5], renormalization of the Fermi

velocity [8, 10–12], gap opening at the Dirac point [4, 13–16], topological currents [15] and

gate-dependent pseudospin mixing [17]. Hence, understanding the impact of superlattice

potential on the band structure of graphene is crucial for advancing its device applications,

and gaining new knowledge about the fundamental physics of Dirac fermions in a periodic

potential.

Previously, the existence of SDCs has been deduced from scanning tunneling spectroscopy,

resistivity and capacitance measurements [2, 5, 18, 19]. However, such measurements are

not capable of mapping out the electronic dispersion with momentum-resolved information,

and the lack of direct experimental results has led to ambiguous and even conﬂicting con-

clusions about the electronic spectra of SDCs and the existence of gaps. Although various

theoretical models have been proposed [10, 11, 20–23], the locations and dispersions of SDCs

strongly depend on the parameters used to describe the inversion-symmetric and inversion-

asymmetric superlattice potential modulation [10]. Diﬀerent choices of inversion-symmetric

perturbation could result in either isolated or overlapping SDCs [10], and the locations of

SDCs could change from the edges of the superlattice Brillouin zone (SBZ) [9, 10] to the

corners [10, 11, 21]. The eﬀect of the moir´e pattern on the gap opening at the graphene Dirac

cone and SDCs is another highly debated issue with some theory and experimental studies

arguing for its existence [4, 12, 14, 19, 21, 23–25] while others ruling it out [2, 6–8, 11]. Such

knowledge gaps in understanding the fundamental electronic structure of graphene/h-BN

call for a careful examination of the electronic structure by angle-resolved photoemission

3

spectroscopy (ARPES) which can map out the dispersions of original Dirac cone and SDCs

with both energy- and momentum- resolution and detect gap opening directly if there is

any.

ARPES studies of graphene/h-BN heterostructure had been challenging for several rea-

sons. Firstly, the size of the heterostructure prepared by transferring graphene atop the h-BN

substrate was typically a few micrometers (µm), much smaller than the typical ARPES beam
size of 50-100 µm. Secondly, because of the large Moir´e periodicity (≈15 nm, 56 times of
graphene’ s lattice constant for 0◦ aligned graphene/h-BN), the separation between the origi-
nal Dirac cone of graphene and the cloned Dirac cones is extremely small, on the order of the
reciprocal superlattice vector Gs ≈ 0.048˚A−1. Resolving band dispersions with such a small
momentum separation requires extremely high quality samples with sharp spectral features.
Recently, high quality 0◦ aligned graphene/h-BN heterostructures with large size extending a
few hundred µm have been successfully grown directly by remote plasma-enhanced chemical

vapor deposition (R-PECVD) [19], and this has made our ARPES studies possible.

Figure 1(a,b) shows the optical and atomic force microscopic images of a typical

graphene/h-BN sample that we have measured [19]. Palladium (Pd) or gold (Au) electrode

was deposited on a small portion of sample for grounding to avoid charging eﬀect during

ARPES measurements. An expected result of the Moir´e potential is replicas of graphene
Dirac cone at the same energy while translated by (cid:126)Gs from the graphene K point (Fig. 1(c)).
Fig. 1(d) shows ARPES data measured along the Γ-K direction. Dispersions from the π and

σ bands of both graphene and h-BN are observed, and they overlap in most regions except

the π band near the K point. Here, characteristic linear dispersion from the Dirac cone of

graphene is observed, while the top of the π band from h-BN lies at -2.2 eV, in agreement

with the large band gap of h-BN. The absence of graphene π band splitting conﬁrms that

the sample is dominated by monolayer graphene. The duplicated Dirac cones are obvious

in both the Fermi surface map (panel (e)) and the dispersion images through the nearest

SBZ centers (panels (f-h)). The average separation between the original Dirac band and its
replicas is ≈ 0.042 ˚A

in ARPES data [26] are also shown in panels (b1-b5). At -250 meV, a small pocket is

visible at the upper right and lower right corners of the SBZ (red dots, labeled as κ in panel

(a1)), and is especially clear at -350 meV and -400 meV. The size of the pockets grows

with increasing binding energy, which is indicative of the conical dispersions. Dispersion

images (Panels (d1-d5)) taken near these corners further support the existence of conical

dispersions. When approaching the second generation Dirac points (SDPs) at κ (cuts d1

through d3), the dispersion relations exhibit a rounded M-shape, with the top of these two

cones moving toward lower binding energies and reaching -0.21 eV at SDPs (cut d3). After

passing the SDPs, the tops of the valence bands move to higher binding energies (cuts d3,

d4 and d5), again in agreement with conical dispersion relations. We note that around
the right corner of SBZ (labeled as κ(cid:48)), no cone-like dispersion is observed, suggesting that
the two superlattice valleys κ and κ(cid:48) are inequivalent. Therefore, both the constant energy
maps and the dispersion images presented above reveal directly that SDCs exist at the SBZ

corners and only at one of the two superlattice valleys [23], which is agreement with the

Landau level degeneracy implied from previous quantum Hall eﬀect measurements [5, 19].

Fitting results of the EDCs across SDPs with two (g-h) or three (i) lorentz curves. The energy

separation between the simulated lorentz peaks (ticks on cyan curves) indicates the gap size.

Such direct information is critical for determining the parameters used for describing the

generic band structure of SDCs [10, 20], and for further understanding other experimental

results which probe the electronic structure indirectly.

To better resolve the detailed dispersions of the SDCs, we show in Figs. 3(a) ARPES data

taken near the κ point of the SBZ. The conduction bands and valence bands show a rounded

W- and M-shape respectively with a large energy separation and a suppression of intensity

7

between them. This indicates the gap opening at the SDCs. The energy distribution curves

(EDCs) are shown in panel (d). In addition to peaks from the conduction and valence bands,

there are also non-dispersive peaks (marked by blue ticks) at the band extrema, suggesting

that there are signiﬁcant impurity scatterings at the gap edges. From the extracted disper-
sions, the gap at the SDCs is ≈ 100 meV. Direct observation of the SDC around the left
corner of the SBZ (inset in Figs. 3(b,c), which is equivalent to those two corners discussed

above) from constant energy maps presented in Fig. 2 is diﬃcult since the intensity around

this region is dominated by the original graphene Dirac cone. However, data taken along

two high symmetry directions Γ-K and Γ-M (Figs. 3(b,c)) prove its existence with a similar

gap. The observation of the gaps in the SDCs and at only one of the superlattice valleys

κ suggests that the inversion-asymmetric perturbation potential from the h-BN substrate

plays an important role in the electronic structure of graphene/h-BN.

To check whether there is a gap at the original Dirac cone, we dope the graphene/h-BN

with depositing Rubidium to shift the Dirac point below EF so that it can be measured

by ARPES. By shifting the Dirac point to -0.2 eV, the dispersion from conduction band

becomes detectable. Figs. 4 (c1-c5) show a few cuts around the original graphene K point (see

schematic drawing in (a)). Because the photoemitted electrons from higher binding energy

have lower kinetic energy and smaller in-plane momentum component, the cutting planes are

slightly tilted. The extracted dispersions from peaks in the momentum distribution curves

(MDCs, panels (d1-d5)) where the bands are linear and the EDCs (panels (e1-e5)) near

the Dirac point are overplotted as dotted and solid lines in panels (c1-c5), and the zoom-in

dispersions near the Dirac point are shown in panel (i). The conduction and valence bands

do not touch each other when the cutting plane crosses K point, signalling a gap opening

at the original Dirac point. Figs. 4 (f-h) show data through the K point from sample 2.

The dispersion is consistent with sample 1 while the intensity suppression from the gap at

SDCs is still visible maybe because of higher sample quality. The gap sizes at original Dirac

point measured from sample 1 and sample 2 at diﬀerent doping levels (see Supplementary
Figure.S1,S2,S3) are summarized in panel (j) and the gap is extracted to be around 160± 30
meV.

The gap opening at the original Dirac cone and SDCs, together with the emergence of

SDCs at only one superlattice valley, suggests that there is a strong inversion symmetry

breaking in graphene/h-BN heterostructure. It has been suggested a band gap opening at

the graphene Dirac cone and SDCs can be induced by an inversion asymmetric mass term in

the perturbation potential [10, 21, 23], i.e. diﬀerence in the average site energy at diﬀerent

lattices of graphene caused by the h-BN substrate, and the mass term can vary by orders of

magnitude depending on the assumptions used [13, 27, 28]. Our gap value is much larger than
that deduced from indirect measurements, e.g. 15∼30 meV from transport measurements

9

in transferred graphene/h-BN [4, 16] and ≈ 40 meV from magneto-optical spectroscopy
on similar RP-CVD samples [24], and the gap also exceeds the maximum gap value of ≈50
meV for perfectly lattice matched heterostructure from density functional theory calculations

[13]. This observation suggests that our epitaxial grown graphene/h-BN samples have much

stronger short-range interlayer interaction than commonly believed in ideal structures, and

that the substantial in [16] and out-of-plane distortions in both graphene and h-BN sheets

[25] and vertical electric ﬁeld near the surface [27, 29] may be able to account for the large

enough variations in the local mass term required to produce a large average gap. Earlier

theories have suggested that many body interactions can substantially enhance the gap size

at the primary Dirac cone [23, 25, 28] in charge neutral systems. Our direct observations

of sizeable gaps for electron doped samples indicate that the inversion symmetry breaking

potentials and the atomic structure at the interface is playing an important role in the

physics of our graphene/h-BN samples.

To summarize, ARPES studies on high quality graphene/h-BN heterostructure have re-

vealed for the ﬁrst time directly the dispersions of SDCs and a large gap opening at both the

SDCs and original Dirac cone. Such direct experimental results resolve the long-standing

puzzles in the superlattice band structure engineering of graphene/h-BN, and points out the

important role of inversion asymmetric perturbation potential and the equilibrium interface

structure in the physics of graphene/h-BN.

Methods

Sample preparation. Graphene samples were directly grown on h-BN substrates by

the epitaxial method as speciﬁed in ref.[19]. As-grown samples were characterized by tap-

ping mode AFM (MultiMode IIId, Veeco Instruments) at room temperature in ambient

atmosphere. We used freshly cleaved mica as shadow masks for metal electrode deposition.

Using the micromanipulator mounted on an optical microscope, the freshly cleaved mica

ﬂakes were accurately transferred on the substrates, covering one side of the substrates with
most area of target graphene/h-BN samples. The contact metal (∼ 40 nm Pd or Au) was
deposited on the non-mica-covered area with a small part of target graphene/h-BN samples.
The samples were then annealed at 200◦C, after removing the mica ﬂakes directively.

ARPES measurement. ARPES measurements have been performed using ARPES in-

struments based at the synchrotron-radiation light source at beamline 12.0.1 of the Advanced

Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The data were recorded

10

by Scienta R3000 at BL 12.0.1 with 50 and 60 eV photo energy. The energy and angle res-
olution is better than 30 meV and 0.2◦ respectively. Before measurement, the samples were
annealed at 200◦C for a few hours until clean surfaces were exposed. All measurements were
performed between 10-20 K and under vacuum better than 5 × 10−11 Torr. The Rubidium
deposition was achieved by heating up SAES commercial dispenser in situ.
