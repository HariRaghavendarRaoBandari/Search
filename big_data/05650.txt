Abstract

The possibility to build a SiPM-readout muon detector (SiRO), using plastic

scintillators with optical ﬁbers as sensitive volume and readout by SiPM photo-

diodes, is investigated. SiRO shall be used for tracking cosmic muons based

on amplitude discrimination. The detector concept foresees a stack of 6 active

layers, grouped in 3 sandwiches for determining the muon trajectories through

3 planes. After investigating the characteristics of the photodiodes, tests have

been performed using two detection modules, each being composed from a plas-
tic scintillator sheet, 100 × 25 × 1 cm3, with 12 parallel, equidistant ditches;
each ditch ﬁlled with an optical ﬁber of 1.5 mm thickness and always two ﬁbers

connected to form a channel. The attenuation of the light response along the

optical ﬁber and across the channels have been tested. The measurements of the

incident muons based on the input amplitude discrimination indicate that this

procedure is not eﬃcient and therefore not suﬃcient, as only about 30% of the

measured events could be used in the reconstruction of the muon trajectories.

Based on the studies presented in this paper, the layout used for building the

SiRO detector will be changed as well as the analog acquisition technique will

1. Introduction

Silicon-Photomultiplier (SiPM) are semiconductor based photo-sensors that

oﬀer several advantages compared to other photo detection devices, like the

classical photomultipliers:

• higher photon detection probability
• improved time resolution
• reduced power consumption pro active area
• considerable reduced need of volume for installation
• reduced electric voltage for operation
• mechanical robustness
• insensitivity for high magnetic ﬁelds

These features have prompted an interesting technological development for ac-

tual and future experiments (e.g. see [1, 2, 3]) being also considered to be suited

for astroparticle physics experiments, in particular with the aim of the obser-

vation of particles produced by primary cosmic rays in the atmosphere. The

features have prompted ideas of dedicated applications as detectors for muons

(in particular together with optical ﬁbers) in various diﬀerent ﬁelds, also for

example in establishing ‘muon tomography’, i.e. giving access to the opacity of

archaeological and geological structures [4, 5]. In this course we aim to setup

a multi-purpose, mobile muon tracking detector based on SiPM readout, called

SiRO, the SiPM ReadOut muon detector. Such a tracking detector will ﬁrst

be used underground in the Slanic salt mine, caracterised in [6], to determine

muon multiplicities and to analyze the structure of the salt layers. The aim

of the present paper is to investigate the possibility to determine the muon in-

cidence and their trajectories using scintillator layers readout through optical

2

ﬁbers viewed by SiPM devices and analysing the amplitude of the events. The

general concept of the SiRO detector is presented as well as tests and measure-

ments with a setup of two ﬁrst detection modules are described.

2. The concept of the SiRO detector layout

SiRO is designed for ﬂux measurements and arrival direction identiﬁcation [8]

of cosmic muons, and planned to be installed ﬁrst in an underground location,

i.e. the Unirea salt mine from Slanic Prahova, Romania. The ﬁst prototype is

composed of 6 active layers (Fig. 1), each layer consisting of 4 detection modules.

A detection module uses as sensitive volume a scintillator plate (Polystyrol 80 %,
Methylmetacrylate 20 %) of 100 × 25 × 1 cm3 with 12 parallel and equidistant
ditches on its surface, each ditch ﬁlled with optical ﬁbers. Two adjacent optical

ﬁbers are connected to a SiPM device to form a channel, so that each detection

module have six channels. In Figure 2 a sketch of one active layer is presented.

Each group of two active layers (from top to bottom), with the optical ﬁbers

positioned on perpendicular directions, represent a sandwich, which should de-

termine the position in the input XY plane of the incident charged particle.

Thus, as we can see in Fig. 1, six active layers with four SiRO modules each,

grouped in three sandwiches, are put in coincidence to allow the reconstruction

of the muon trajectory.

Fig. 3 shows the block scheme of the acquisition system [9]. The six active

layers are indicated as Det1 to Det6 and contain 24 channels each, so the whole

system will give information from 144 individual channels.

The 24 signals from each active layer are used as an input by a trigger mod-

ule to create coincidences by a certain multiplicity criteria in order to produce

a trigger signal, marking an event of interest. The trigger signal is sent by daisy

chain along 3 modules 64 Channel Digitizer (V1740 CAEN). These modules al-

low to open an acquisition window with selected pre-trigger time, compensating

in this way the necessary delay to produce the trigger pulse. A USB2.0 Bridge

(V1718 CAEN) is used to transfer the digitized signals to a PC.

3

Figure 1: Schematic view of the SiRO detector.

Each channel of the digitizer has a SRMA memory, where the event can be

readout by using the PCI-VME bridge module. The events are read sequentially

and transmitted to the computer. The selection of the real events, as well as

the track reconstruction is performed oﬀ-line, after the run is stopped, through

a software based on custom-made C++ routines.

3. Tests and results

To test the performances of the planned SiRO detector, i.e. its properties,

as well as its ﬂuctuations related to bias voltage, temperature, or the distance

between the interaction point and the SiPM device, two detection modules have

been built and placed in boxes for optical screening.

channel.

3.1. The description of the SiPM devices

To interpret the light signal produced at the interaction of a charged par-

ticle with the sensitive volume of the detector, devices like photomultipliers or

photodiodes are used to convert the light yield into electrical output through

photoelectric eﬀect. Similar to photodiodes, a Silicon Photomultiplier is a semi-

conductor device, but their sensitive volume is divided into a matrix of hun-

dreds of independent micro-cells, also named pixels, connected in parallel. Each

micro-cell is operated in Geiger mode, the output signal of the SiPM device

being proportional with the number of independent pixels triggered simultane-

ously.

A lot of interest is devoted to SiPM devices in the last years [10, 11, 12, 13].

5

Figure 3: The block scheme of the acquisition system [9].

The properties of SiPM devices, like gain, after pulsing, cross-talk, dark noise,

were carefully investigated in various studies [14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

We choose for our detector the MPPC S10362-33-100C model from Hama-
matsu [19], with an eﬀective area of 3 × 3 mm2. This device have been tested
particularly at the Max-Planck-Institute of Physics in Munich [20] with an ex-

perimental setup consisting of a stable voltage source, a signal ampliﬁer (factor

50), a pulsed laser (pulsed diode laser PDL 800-B from PicoQuant) controlled

by a signal generator (Synthesized Function Generator model DS345 - from

Stanford Research Systems). The output signals have been observed using a

LC684DXL 1.5 GHz oscilloscope. Using the laser to trigger the events, we ob-

served (Fig. 4) the peaks corresponding to one to ﬁve photoelectrons, as well as

the thermal noise.

We also found that the device is very sensitive to the variation of the bias

voltage: an increase in gain with increasing voltage, but, also an proportional

increase of unwanted eﬀects with the gain, such as cross-talk and after pulsing

eﬀects. A signiﬁcant sensitivity with the temperature was observed as well. An-

other aspect is that there are important diﬀerences from one device to another,

so in order to have a uniform response, an individual analysis and calibration is

required. The dependence of the gain on the operating conditions of the SiPM

devices, like bias voltage and operating temperature, were observed in other

studies as well, see, e.g. [21, 22].

3.2. Preliminary tests

The ﬁrst step was to test the response of a Detection Channel (DC) to muons,

as well as how this response is changed with the applied bias voltage [20, 23, 24].

Measurements have been performed with two scintillator test probes S1 and
S2 of size 10 × 10 × 5 cm3, each connected to a photomultiplier, with the

7

tested DC placed between them. In order to ensure that the registered incident

particles are from the deﬁned solid angle spanned by S1 and S2, the coincidence

between the three devices DC, S1 and S2, is made. After a particle interact

with all three sensitive volumes, the resulting three signals are passed through

a FRONT END & TRIGGER module. First, the pulses are passed through a

variable threshold voltage comparator, being transformed from analogical type

into a logical one with variable length, given by the time that the input sig-

nals stayed over the threshold. After that, those pulses are passed through a

monostable circuit, forming output signals constant in length (100 ns) and am-

plitude, then through the coincidence circuit. The resulting pulse is registered

by a SCALER-TIMER module.

Figure 5: The variation of rates with the bias voltage of the SiPM [24].

We measured the variation of the pulse rate from the DC and the coincidence

rate of S1 & S2 & DC with the bias voltage of the SiPM device, the temperature

being kept constant and the bias voltage of S1 and S2 also constant. The results

are displayed in Fig. 5. It is easy to see that both, the S1 & S2 & DC coincidence

Taking into account that pulses from the SiPM device have about 200 ns

in duration, for limiting the pileup eﬀect, the average period of random pulses

obtained should be ten times bigger than the pulse duration, which is 2 µs in

our case and which corresponds to a maximum allowed rate of 500.000 counts/s.

An optimum bias voltage has been chosen at 70.35 V, so the DC rate to be small

enough and the S1 & S2 & DC rate to be as high as possible.

By measuring the coincidence rate between superposed S1 and S2 test probes,

a rate of 167 counts/1000s has been obtained. This means that for DC to have

100% relative eﬃciency with respect to S1&S2, the coincidence rate between

S1 & S2 & DC needs to be 167 counts/1000s. Taking into account the optimum

bias voltage that we choose, the relative eﬃciency of the DC as compared to S1
& S2 coincidence rate is ≈ 35%.

3.3. Investigation of the light response

The light attenuation in respect to distance between the interaction point of

muons with the sensitive volume and the SiPM device position is an important

feature for the readout of scintillator detectors through Wave-Length-Shifter

ﬁbers. Such investigations were aleady reported by diﬀerent experiments [25,

26, 27].

Tests have been performed upon a detection channel module (DC) to ﬁnd

how the light response is attenuated [23, 24]. We used for this purpose a LED

diode, with the emission wavelength in the blue spectrum, steered by a signal

generator (AFG TEKTONIX 3252).

First, the responses of the channels have been aligned by stimulating each

optical ﬁber with the LED device and setting the SiPM devices output signal

to a ﬁxed value through bias voltage corrections. The distribution of the signal

amplitudes given by each SiPM is shown in Figure 6. The LED excitation was

ﬁxed in a way that the maximum amplitude of the signal on every channel to

be in the range of 0.8 V - 0.9 V.

Diﬀerent attenuation tests have been performed:

i) The signal attenuation across the 6 channels that compose a detection

module

The responses of all six channels were registered during the stimulation of

the 6th channel with the LED diode at 96 cm distance from the corresponding

SiPM device. As we can see in Fig. 7, a 33 % attenuation on the neighboring

channel was obtained (which is not enough for a clear amplitude discrimination),

followed by a more abrupt decrease of the signals amplitudes in the remaining

module when the module is triggered by a LED diode in the vicinity of the sixth channel [23].

ii) The signal attenuation along one single channel

Measuring the amplitudes of the signals on the same detection channel when

the LED excitation is applied at diﬀerent distances along one of the channels

optical ﬁbers, the light attenuation curve shown in Fig. 8 is obtained. The drop

in light response is signiﬁcant, a 43 % light attenuation is observed at positions

between 17 and 97 cm.

3.4. Testing the detection module response at diﬀerent temperature gradients

To measure how temperature aﬀects our results, one detection module has

been tested underground in the Unirea salt mine at Slanic Prahova, Romania,

at diﬀerent ambient temperature in the interval 13o to 20o Celsius. The bias

voltage for each channel was selected that, at 13o Celsius, its individual counting

rate to be at about 400 counts/s.

11

Channel123456 Amplitude [mV]0200400600800Figure 8: The signal amplitude attenuation versus the distance between the interaction point

and the SiPM device [8, 24].

The results plotted in Fig. 9 shows that the rates are dramatically decreasing

with the increase of temperature. A ﬂuctuation of 1o C will change signiﬁcantly

the response of the SiPM devices. Taking this into account, we conclude that

the ﬁnal conﬁguration of the SiPM muon detector should be placed in an en-

vironment with high thermal stability, like the underground Unirea salt mine

from Slanic Prahova, where the environmental temperature is about 12oC-13o

C in every moment of the day or the year.

3.5. Tests of muon detection using a two detection modules system

Two detection modules, named D1 and D2, were put in coincidence to test

their response to muons. For this, a 12 channels NIM module was used. Each

NIM channel is equipped with a variable threshold comparator. The ﬁrst 6

channels corresponds to D1 and are summarized by an OR function. A similar

treatment is applied to the next 6 channels that corresponds to D2. Both OR

outputs are put in coincidence by an AND function. The block diagram of the

channels, versus the environmental temperature.

NIM module is represented in Fig. 10.

In this way, when a muon cross both detection modules, a coincidence signal

is formed, which is used as trigger by a digitizer (DT5740 from CAEN) to

transfer the recorded data to a PC for storage.

Before starting the measurements, each SiPM device has been tested. Fig. 11

shows the dependence of the SiPM counting rates on the applied bias voltage.

The measurements have been made using with D1 and D2 detection modules

placed in diﬀerent conﬁgurations, as it is shown in Fig. 12, with the individual

SiPM bias voltages set for the detection modules responses to ﬁt in four diﬀerent

rate intervals (R1 to R4). The results are presented in Table 1.

It is observed an increase of the coincidence rate obtained with the D1 and D2

system with the increasing of the individual SiPM rates due to false coincidence

events. Increasing the rate from the R1 rate interval to that of R4, leads to a gain

increase of the response of the SiPM devices, but also to a much steeper increase

of the crosstalk eﬀect. It can also be seen that the coincidence rate between D1

and D2 is strongly dependent on their placement within the 4 conﬁgurations.

Taking that into account, the R1 rate interval was chosen for further testing.

The conﬁguration (b), with the modules D1 and D2 totally superposed, is being

used.

3.6. Testing amplitude pulse discrimination

The aim of those measurements were to investigate, how well we can de-

termine (by tracking the position) where the incident muons interact with the

sensitive volumes of D1 and D2 modules based on an amplitude pulse discrimi-

nation.

Coincidence measurements were performed with the D1-D2 detection sys-

tem described above where the individual rates for each SiPM device was ﬁxed

superposed at the collection side; d) D1 and D2 superposed at the opposite side of collection.

A C++ routine was developed to analyze the stored data [23] for determining

if a registered event, triggered by the NIM module, is a valid one and can be

used to determine the muon trajectory.

The routine consists of two parts: In the ﬁrst part, the peak amplitudes for

all channels are counted, the peak distribution are obtained, and the average

value for each channel response is calculated. The second part analyzes each

event triggered by the digitizer and decide if it can be accepted as a valid one.

For an event to be valid, the following conditions must be fulﬁlled: The peak

amplitude should be at least 70 mV high. The time diﬀerence between the peak

16

generated in the top module and in the bottom module should be lower than

32 ns. A minimum of 2 peaks on adjacent channels have to be available at both

top and bottom module.

In Fig. 13, a valid event is exempliﬁed where the trajectory is determined by

software. When such a trajectory cannot be found we ﬂag the event as invalid.

Figure 13: Example of a valid event. The top spectrum represents D1 channels, the bottom

one represents the channels from D2 [23].

The eﬃciency of the D1-D2 detection system to determine the trajectory

of the incident muons was obtained by analyzing a number of 56749 events

triggered by the NIM Module in 7 diﬀerent runs. The software routine validated

a number of 17169 events, resulting in a 29.1% eﬃciency value.

4. Concluding remarks and outlook

The properties of the MPPC S10362-33-100C device from Hamamatsu have

been investigated (attached to ﬁbers grooved in bars of scintillation detectors),

especially their behavior in respect to bias voltage changes and temperature

ﬂuctuations.

Tests have been performed with a detection module of the detector to de-

ﬁne its characteristics. After calibrating each channel with a LED device, the

attenuation of the light signal has been investigated along the ﬁbers that forms

a channel and across the channels that form the detection module.

the muon response was tested for diﬀerent SiPM rate intervals. Comparing the

results obtained with the two detection modules placed in a parallel side by side

conﬁguration or placed parallel one above the other, it is observed that there

are small diﬀerences when the SiPM devices are set to ﬁt to the 7000 counts/s

and the 70 000 counts/s rate intervals. This is mainly due to high crosstalk

and dark noise rates of the SiPM devices, leading to the conclusion that those

individual rate intervals are unreliable.

Therefore, the parallel conﬁguration with the detection modules placed one

above the other was chosen for further testing, with the SiPM individual rates

being ﬁxed to a total rate of the detection modules to ﬁt the interval of 700-800

counts/s.

The possibility to determine the incidence point in the input XY plane of

the incident muon using two detection modules through the amplitude pulse

discrimination method has been proven to be valid. Unfortunately, we ﬁnd out

that the eﬃciency of this method is only about 30 %, i.e. not enough to continue

using it as a basic concept for the design of the planned multi-purpose, mobile

SiRO detector.

Based on the tests and results presented in this paper, we decided to develop

a new method, by replacing the old detection module that sum-up all 6 channel
responses by 6 individual channels obtained by slicing its 25 × 100 × 1 cm3
sensitive volume into 4 × 10 × cm3 stripes and replacing the analog acquisition
technique by a digital one. By this it is expected to improve the performance

and the stability of SiRO, including a better use of the aforementioned advan-

tages of the readout based on SiPMs.
