Li et al. in [15] proved that the IVP (1.1) with the minus sign is LWP in H ´3{4pRq.

classical Sobolev spaces. Among them, Kato considered weighted Sobolev spaces.

In this work we will be concerned with the well-posedness of the IVP (1.1) in weighted Sobolev
spaces. IThis type of spaces arises in a natural manner when we are interested in determining if
the Schwartz space is preserved by the ﬂow of the evolution equations in (1.1). These spaces also
appear in the study of the persistence in time of the regularity of the Fourier transform of the
solutions of the IVP (1.1).

Some relevant nonlinear evolution equations as the KdV equation, the non-linear Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, the Benjamin-Ono equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation have also been studied in
the context of weighted Sobolev spaces (see [3], [1], [4], [6], [7], [11], [17], [18], [19] and [2] and
references therein).

We will study real valued solutions of the IVP (1.1) in the weighted Sobolev spaces

It is interesting to know how this term behaves when we are working in the context of weighted
Sobolev spaces.

x uqp :“ |ξ|´spu).

The relation between the indices s and r for the solutions of the IVP (1.1) can be found, following
the considerations, contained in the work of Kato (for more details see [2]): it turns out that the
natural weighted Sobolev space to study the IVP (1.1) is Zs,s{2.
Our aim in this article is to prove that the IVP (1.1) is locally well posed (LWP) in Zs,s{2 for
3
4 ă s ď 1. Our method of proof is based on the contraction mapping principle and has two
ingredients. First of all, we use the result of local well posedness, obtained by Linares and Milan´es

Moreover, for any T 1 P p0, Tq there exists a neighborhood V of u0 in Xs such that the map datum-
solution ˜u0 ÞÑ ˜u is Lipschitz from H s into the class deﬁned by (1.2)-(1.5) with T 1 instead of T .
On the other hand, we need a tool to treat fractional powers of |x|. A key idea in this direction is
to use a characterization of the generalized Sobolev space

Using (1.7) (for p “ 2), (1.9), (1.10) and Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3 we deduce an estimate for the weighted
L2-norm of the group associated to the linear part of the Ostrovsky equations, }|x|bU˘ptqf}L2, in
terms of t, }|x|bf}L2, }f}H 2b and }D´2bf}L2 (see Lemma 2.4 in section 2).
This estimate is similar to that, obtained by Fonseca, Linares and Ponce in [5] (see formulas 1.8
and 1.9 in Theorem 1) for the KdV equation.
The linear estimates for the group of the linear part of the Ostrovsky equations, obtained by Linares
and Milan´es in [16], together with the estimate for the weighted L2-norm of the group, allow us to
obtain, by the contraction mapping principle, that the IVP (1.1) is LWP in a certain subspace of
Zs,s{2.
Now we formulate in a precise manner the main result of this article.

Theorem 1.1. Let 3{4 ă s ď 1 and u0 P Zs,s{2 a real valued function. Then there exist T ą 0 and
a unique u, in a certain subspace YT of Cpr0, Ts; Zs,s{2q, solution of the IVP (1.1). (The deﬁnition
of the subspace YT will be clear in the proof of the theorem).
Moreover, for any T 1 P p0, Tq there exists a neighborhood V of u0 in Zs,s{2 such that the data-solution
map ˜u0 ÞÑ ˜u from V into YT 1 is Lipschitz.
Remark 1. When s ą 1 we do not know an interpolation inequality, similar to that in [18], but
including negative exponents of p1 ´ ∆q. By this reason we can not apply the method used in [2] in
order to obtain that the IVP (1.1) is LWP in Zs,s{2 when s ą 1.
Remark 2. Local well-posedness results of the IVP (1.1) in H spRq for s ď 3

This article is organized as follows: in section 2 we recall the Leibniz rule for fractional derivatives,
deduced by Kenig, Ponce and Vega in [13] (subsection 2.1), and we ﬁnd (subsection 2.2) appropriate
estimates for the Stein derivatives of order b in R of the functions eitx3
x (Lemmas 2.2 and
2.3), which have an important consequence (Lemma 2.4) that aﬃrms that the weighted Sobolev
space Zs,s{2 remains invariant by the group. In section 3, we use the results, obtained in section 2,
in order to prove Theorem 1.1.

that

U˘pt ´ t1qpvBxvqpt1qdt1.

Proceeding as in [16], let us deﬁne, for T ą 0, the metric space

XT :“ tv P Cpr0, Ts; Xsq : |}v|} ă 8u,

(When s “ 1 in (3.4) we change Ds by Bx)
For a ą 0, let X a

T be the closed ball in XT deﬁned by

X a
T :“ tv P XT : |}v|} ď au.

We will prove that there exist T ą 0 and a ą 0 such that the operator Ψ : X a

From now on we will suppose as in [16] that we are working with the group tU`ptqu, being the
other case similar.
