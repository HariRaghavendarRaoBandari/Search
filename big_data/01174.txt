Abstract: We explore a new connection between Seiberg–Witten theory and quantum sta-
tistical systems by relating the dual partition function of SU (2) Super Yang-Mills theory in a
self–dual Ω–background to the spectral determinant of an ideal Fermi gas. We show that the
spectrum of this gas is encoded in the zeroes of the Painlev´e III τ function. Our construction
arises as a four-dimensional limit of a recently proposed conjecture relating topological strings
and spectral theory. In this limit, we provide a mathematical proof of the conjecture for the local
P1 × P1 geometry.

Introduction

Supersymmetric partition functions of gauge theories in four dimensions can be regarded as a
new class of special functions which permeates many subjects in physics and mathematics, such
as classical [1–3] and quantum integrable systems [4–6], two-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theories
[7] and quantum hydrodynamics [8–13], diﬀerential [14–16] and enumerative geometry [17].
In this paper we explore a new aspect of this web of connections, which concerns quantum
statistical systems. More precisely, we show that the dual partition function of N = 2 SU (2)
Super Yang-Mills in four dimensions in a self–dual Ω–background is the spectral determinant of
a quantum system given by an ideal Fermi gas. This in turn is also related to a statistical model
describing self-avoiding polymers in two-dimensions.
The core of our work relies on the merging of two topics. The ﬁrst one is the connection
between four dimensional N = 2 gauge theories and Painlev´e transcendants found in [18–22] and
the other is a recently proposed conjecture relating topological strings and spectral theory [23].
The main result of [18–22] is that the Nekrasov–Okounkov (NO) partition function of SU (2)
four dimensional gauge theory calculates the τ function of a corresponding Painlev´e equation.

More precisely, for the pure N = 2 gauge theory it has been shown that the NO partition
function, deﬁned in terms of the standard Nekrasov partition function as

ZNO(η, a/, T ) =

e4πinηZNek(, a + n, T ) ,

(1.1)

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

computes the general τ function of the Painlev´e III3 equation. The gauge theory parameters
a and η are related to the initial conditions of the speciﬁc solution. A thorough discussion of
this relation including new long distance expansions of solutions to Painlev´e equations and their
relation with Argyres–Douglas points will be presented elsewhere [24].

On the other hand, in the conjecture of [23], one associates to any toric Calabi–Yau three-
fold X a trace class operator ρX whose spectral determinant computes the non–perturbative
topological string partition function. More precisely one has

det (1 + κρX ) =

eJ(µ+2πin)

κ = eµ

(1.2)

where J is the non–perturbative topological string free energy (or grand canonical potential).

It is well known that a class of N = 2 gauge theories in four dimensions can be engineered
by using toric Calabi–Yau threefolds [17, 25]. For instance, by taking the so–called geometric
engeneering limit of local P1 × P1 one generates the N = 2 supersymmetric SU (2) gauge theory
out of string theory. More precisely, diﬀerent phases of the four dimensional theory in the
gravitational background parameters can be obtained by diﬀerent scaling limits of the reﬁned
topological string. In [26] the authors speciﬁed the conjecture of [23] in the four dimensional
limit corresponding to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) regime (2 = 0) and the resulting spectral
problem was found to coincide with the quantum Toda system found in [27].
In this paper we study a diﬀerent regime in the Ω-background parameters of the four di-
mensional gauge theory, namely 1 = −2 = . Moreover, we scale the K¨ahler parameters of the
Calabi-Yau in terms of , therefore implementing a limit which is slightly diﬀerent from the usual
geometric engineering one, see Section 3 for details. In this limit we ﬁnd that the conjecture
(1.2) connects to the NO partition function (1.1) with η = 0.

Our result can be interpreted in a twofold way. On one side it is a proof of the conjecture
(1.2) in the four dimensional limit. On the other, it is a new connection between Seiberg-Witten
theory on self-dual background and the spectral theory of an ideal Fermi gas.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we recall the content of the conjecture

of [23] in a form suitable for the subsequent manipulations.

In Section 3 we give a proof for the conjecture of [23] in the four dimensional limit by using
the well known results on spectral determinants [28] together with the recent devolvements in
the context of Painlev´e equations [18–22]. More precisely we show that both the l.h.s and the
r.h.s of (1.2) satisfy the Painlev´e III3 equation in the τ form with the same initial conditions.

In Section 4 we analyze our results from the four dimensional gauge theory perspective. We
show that the four dimensional SU (2) Nekrasov–Okounkov partition function can be expressed
by using the grand canonical partition function of an ideal Fermi gas. This gas is characterized
by the following density operator
ρ = e−4T 1/4 cosh(ˆx)

(cid:0)eˆp/2 + e−ˆp/2(cid:1) e−4T 1/4 cosh(ˆx),

[ˆx, ˆp] = 2πi.

(1.3)

4π

This means that we have a one dimensional ideal Fermi gas in an external conﬁning potential

V (x) = 8T 1/4 cosh(x).

(1.4)

– 2 –

In this way we provide a Fermi gas picture of gravitational corrections to the Seiberg–Witten
theory. Notice that this picture is diﬀerent from the one of [29], where the authors consider free
fermions lying on the Seiberg–Witten curve.

2 The spectral theory/ topological string conjecture

In this section we brieﬂy review the conjecture of [23]. For a pedagogical review see [30].

In [23], based on previous works [31–35], it has been conjectured a precise and exact duality
between spectral theory and enumerative geometry. In this construction one associates a non–
pertubative trace class operator ρX to any toric Calabi–Yau X whose mirror curve has genus
one 1. This operator has a discrete spectrum, denoted by e−En, which can be organized into a
spectral determinant:

(cid:89)

(cid:0)1 + κe−En(cid:1) .

ΞX (κ) = det(1 + κρX ) =

(2.1)

We also refer to (2.1) as Fredholm determinant.

In this paper the relevant geometry is the anticanonical bundle of P1 × P1 and the corre-

n

sponding mirror curve is

ex + ep + e−p + mF0e−x − κ = 0,

(2.2)
where κ = eµ is the so–called complex modulus of P1 × P1 while mF0 is the so–called mass
parameter. In the following we will often use the ”renormalized” mass parameter introduced in
[37]

log m =

2π
 log mF0.

(2.3)

A detailed description of this geometry and its enumerative content can be found in [38–40]. The
trace class operator arising in the quantization of the mirror curve (2.2) is

(cid:16)

eˆx + eˆp + e−ˆp + mF0e−ˆx(cid:17)−1

ρP1×P1 =

[ˆx, ˆp] = i,

,

, mF0 > 0.

(2.4)

The conjecture of [23] states that the spectral determinant (2.1) can be written explicitly in term
of (reﬁned) GV invariants of X as

(cid:88)

n∈Z

ΞX (κ, ) =

eJ(µ+2πni,),

κ = eµ

(2.5)

where the grand potential, J(µ, ) can be expressed in terms of enumerative invariants of X.
This quantity was ﬁrst introduced in the context of ABJM in [41] and subsequently studied in a
series of works [23, 31, 32, 42–47]. More precisely we have

J(µ, ) = JWKB(µ, ) + JWS(µ, ).

(2.6)

The ”WKB” part is given by

ti(µ, )

∂F NS(t(µ, ), )

JWKB(µ, ) =

 biti(µ, )+A(m, ), (2.7)
where F NS is the Nekrasov–Shatashvili free energy [27], A(m, ) the so–called constant map
contribution [48] and bi are real numbers related to the genus one free energy (see [36] for a

detailed explanation). We denote by ti(µ, ) the quantum K¨ahler parameters of X and by µ
the complex modulus of the mirror geometry. In addition J(µ, ) can depend on a set of mass
parameters. However for sake of notation we do not explicitly write mass dependence. The
”worldsheet” part in (2.6) is given by

where F GV denotes the (unreﬁned) Gopakumar-Vafa free energy and B is the so–called B ﬁeld.
Both F GV and F NS are expressed explicitly in terms of (reﬁned) enumerative invariants [49–51]
as explained in appendix B .

For the local P1 × P1 geometry we have [23]

t1(µ, ) = t(µ, ),

t2 = t(µ, ) − log mF0

(2.9)

where t(µ, ) is the quantum A period of the curve (2.2), it is computed in appendix A. Moreover
the B ﬁeld for this geometry is B = 2 and the bi coeﬃcients in (2.7) are

The explicit expression for the constant map contribution A(m, ) of local P1 × P1 has been
computed in [52] and it reads

the parameter k. Therefore we need to analytically continue the CS partition function. This
analytic continuation is not unique, however the spectral problem associated to local P1 × P1
ﬁxes this ambiguity [46] and the relevant analytic continuation turns out to be the one proposed
in [52], namely

Even though the conjecture of [23] has been successfully tested in many examples [23, 33,
37, 46, 52–56], a proof is still missing. In this paper we perform a ﬁrst step in this direction
by proving the conjecture in a four dimensional limit of local P1 × P1. More precisely we show
that, in this limit, the spectral determinant (2.1) and its conjectural expression (2.5) both fullﬁll
Painlev´e III3 equation with the same asymptotic behaviour.

3 The four dimensional limit
In this section we prove the conjecture [23] in a particular double scaling limit of local P1 × P1.
This double scaling limit is deﬁned as follows. Let us denote by

Q = e− 2π t(µ,),

Qf = mQ,

m > 0,

 > 0.

We parametrize the above quantities by

q = e

4π2i = exp(−β), Q = (β)4T, Qf = exp(−2σβ),

(3.1)

(3.2)

β > 0,

i > 0, T > 0 σ ∈ R/{0}.

The four dimensional limit we are going to study consists in taking β → 0 while keeping the
others parameters ﬁxed. In particular this means that
m,  → ∞,

(3.3)

therefore we are probing the non–perturbative regime of [23]. In this limit one of the two K¨ahler
classes of P1 × P1 shrink while the other goes to inﬁnity.
In [23] m,  are positive numbers,
therefore i and iσ are real and diﬀerent from zero.

Notice that the scaling (3.2) is slightly diﬀerent from the typical four dimensional scaling of

geometric engineering [17, 25] where one deﬁnes

and takes β → 0 i.e.

Q = e−t(µ,) = (βΛ/2)4,

Qf = mF0Q = exp(−2aβ)

mF0 → ∞,

 → 0.

(3.4)

(3.5)

In the scaling limit (3.4) the conjecture of [23] makes contact with the SU (2) quantum Toda
as shown in [26]. However to make contact with Painlev´e III3 equation we have to consider the
scaling (3.2).

In the following we compute the four dimensional limit (3.2) of the spectral determinant
(2.1), see Subsection 3.2, and of its conjectural expression (2.5), see Subsection 3.1, and we show
that they both satisfy Painlev´e III3 equation in the τ form with the same initial conditions.

3.1 The topological string computation
In this section we focus on the four dimensional limit of (2.5) for the local P1 × P1 geometry.

The standard and NS free energies determining the grand potential of this geometry are
computed in appendix B. By using these results we can write the grand canonical potential (2.6)
as

JP1×P1(µ, ) =Jinst(Qf , Q, ) + Joneloop(Qf , ) + A(m, ) + P(t(µ, ), m, ) + JM(Qf , Q, ).

(3.6)

We denote by Jinst the instantons part of the Gopakumar–Vafa free energy (B.8), namely
Jinst(Qf , Q, ) =

In our notation Joneloop(Qf , ) contains the one loop contribution both of standard and NS free
energies. By using the techniques of [26, 52], illustrated in appendix C, we can write (3.8) in
closed form as

Notice that the one–loop term in the gauge theory typically requires a certain regularization
scheme and it exists a scheme in which one recovers the one–loop term of the topological vertex
[57, 58]. This is the same scheme used in the context of AGT correspondence (see appendix
B.2 of [7]). As it was pointed out there, this scheme is diﬀerent from the one used in the NO
partition function [51]. Remarkably, the grand potential (2.6) automatically implements the
correct scheme to make contact with the NO partition function in the self-dual background and
the Painlev´e III3 equation. Similarly the analysis of [26] shows that (2.6) also implements the
correct scheme in the context of SU (2) Toda.

In (3.6) we denote by P(t(µ, ), m, ) the polynomial part of the grand potential, which reads
P(t(µ, ), m, ) = − log(m)t(µ, )2

JM(Qf , Q, )

24π

(3.11)

denotes the instanton part of the WKB grand potential (2.7) which is completely determined by
the instanton part of the NS free energy (B.9). This term will not be important here since it
vanishes in the four dimensional limit (3.2) where we have

e−t1(µ,) =(cid:0)β4T 4(cid:1) 2π

βi ,

e−t2(µ,) = e4iπσ.

(3.12)

It is straightforward to see that (B.9), and as a consequence the instanton part of the WKB grand
potential (3.11), vanishes as we take β → 0. Therefore we are studying precisely the opposite
regime with respect to the one considered in the standard in geometric engineering limit (3.4)
and in the context of Toda systems [26, 27].

To compute the spectral determinant (2.5) we have to perform the shift

µ → µ − 2πin.

By using this expression for the quantum A period given in appendix A we have

t(µ − 2πni, ) = t(µ, ) − 4πin.

Similarly the quantities in (3.1) shift according to

Q → Qq2n

Qf → Qf q2n,

q = e

4π2i .

We are now going to compute the four dimensional limit of each quantity in (3.6).

Instanton contribution

By using the reﬁned topological vertex [57], together with (3.2) and (3.15) we have

c2(σ, n) =

8(σ + n)4(2σ + 2n − 1)2(2σ + 2n + 1)2 .

10(σ + n)2 − 1

Similarly one can write closed form expressions for ck(σ, n) with k ≥ 3. Therefore in the four
dimensional limit, the original shift in the chemical potential (2.5) translates into a shift of the
parameter σ by

σ → σ + n.

It follows that

This is precisely the instanton contribution to the Nekrasov partition function as computed
in [59–61]. As mentioned earlier, in [23] m and  are positive numbers, therefore σ is purely
imaginary. It follows that B(T, σ) has no poles.

3.1.2 One loop contribution

The four dimensional limit of the one loop contribution can be computed straightforwardly from
the integral representation (3.9). We have

This is the four dimensional limit (3.2) of the conjectural expression (2.5) for the spectral deter-

computed from the string theory side of the conjecture [23].

U GIL. They can be read oﬀ from the asymptotic expansion at small t [62, 63]

The solution (3.27) is a convergent, well deﬁned function whenever 2σ /∈ Z [19, 22]. Due to
periodicity properties it is enough to consider σ = 0, 1/2, for these value it exists a regularization
procedure leading to a well deﬁned solution with η → 0 3.

3.2 The operator theory computation

In this section we focus on the operator side of the conjecture [23]. We would like to show that
the spectral determinant (2.1) for the operator

(cid:16)

eˆx + eˆp + e−ˆp + mF0e−ˆx(cid:17)−1

ρP1×P1 =

[ˆx, ˆp] = i

,

(3.34)

is related to the τ function of Painlev´e III3 as in (3.31). We do this without using the conjectural
expression (2.5). The strategy relies on the work of [28] which is summarized in appendix D.

The kernel of the operator (3.34) has been computed in [37] and it reads

ρP1×P1(y1, y2) = e−πbγ/2

|f (y1)||f (y2)|

where

f (x) = eπxb/2 Φb(x − γ/2 + ib/4)

We denote by Φb the Faddeev’s quantum dilogarithm [64, 65]. The parameter γ in (3.35) is
related to the mass m in (2.3), more precisely we have

γ =

We add the subscript O in (3.49) to stress that this is the spectral determinant computed in the

This is precisely a spectral determinant of the Zamolodchikov form (D.2) with potential

(D.3) where

t = 8T 1/4.

(3.52)

This means that also in the operator side we ﬁnd that the spectral determinant (2.1) for the

4 The spectral problem in four dimensions

In this section we focus on the gauge theory interpretation of the results in Section 3. In particular
the above computation shows that the spectrum of the operator (1.3) is determined by the zeros
of the tau function (3.27). This in turns determine the the spectrum of an ideal Fermi gas.

Let us consider the four dimensional matrix model (3.50). For the purposes of this section

is convenient to denote

Then we can write (3.50) as

Z4d(N ) =

λ = 8T 1/4 > 0.

).

(4.1)

(4.2)

This is the so–called polymer matrix model studied in [28, 67, 68]. It was found in [68] that this
matrix model describes an ideal Fermi gas whose density matrix is

ρ(x1, x2) =

.

(4.3)

e− λ

2 cosh(x1)− λ

cosh(cid:0) x1−x2

(cid:1)

2 cosh(x2)

Similarly to what we did in Section (3.2) we ﬁnd that, in the four dimensional limit, the kernel
(3.35) reproduces the kernel (4.3). More precisely we have

ρP1×P1(x1, x2)

4D−−→ e

−2iσπ+

π log(β4T 4)

β

ρ(x1, x2).

(4.4)

The operator corresponding to (4.3) is

ρ = e− λ

(cid:0)eˆp/2 + e−ˆp/2(cid:1) e− λ

4π

2 cosh(ˆx),

[ˆx, ˆp] = 2πi.

(4.5)

As discussed in [68] this corresponds to an ideal Fermi gas in an external potential

and with a non–standard kinetic term given by

V (x) = λ cosh(x)

T (p) = log [2 cosh(p/2)] .

(4.6)

(4.7)

To get some physical intuition on this system it is useful to consider the large energy limit of
this gas, i.e. p, x large. In this regime the Hamiltonian can be approximated by

H(p, x) ≈ 1

| p | +

e|x|.

(4.8)

Therefore we have an ultra-relativistic Fermi gas in a conﬁning potential.

The operator (4.5) is of trace class and has a positive, discrete spectrum e−En which is

determined by the vanishing locus of

O (κ) =

Table 1. The ﬁrst two energy levels for the operator (4.3), obtained from the vanishing locus of the τ
function (3.26) as explained in equation (4.12). The expression of Ξ4d
S (T, σ) is given as a convergent series
at small T . As we keep more terms in the series expansion we quickly approach the energy obtained by
using the numerical methods of [35] applied to (4.3). We take λ = 8π
21 .

In statistical mechanics one typically refers to Ξ4d
of the gas. To make contact with the Painlev´e III3 dictionary we have

O (κ) as the grand canonical partition function

2πκ = cos(2πσ).

(4.10)

Therefore the region which is interesting from the spectral theory point of view is parametrized
by 5

σ =

+ iσr,

σr ∈ R/{0}.

(4.11)

By using this dictionary we can compute numerically the zeros of (3.26) which give the spectrum
of the Fermi gas described by (4.3), where λ and T are related by (4.1). More precisely we have

(4.12)

In Table 1 we compare the numerical spectrum of the operator (4.3) with the zeros of (3.26): we
ﬁnd perfect agreement. Therefore the vanishing locus of the τ function which solves the Painlev´e
III3 equation gives the spectrum of the operator (4.3), as we showed analytically in Section 3.

If we consider the gauge theory perspective, the results of Section 3 show that the spectrum

of (4.3) is computed by the 4 dimensional Nekrasov partition function [59]

5 In Section 3 we restrict ourself to iσ ∈ R/{0} to make contact with the topological string parameters. However
from the four dimensional perspective we can take more general values of σ as in [28] and in [18–22]. From the
topological string perspective this translates into the necessity of extending the conjecture [23] to arbitrary complex
values of , m. In particular notice that for 2σ ∈ Z + iR/{0} one can still invert the mirror map as in appendix A
and (3.11) still vanishes.

– 13 –

Our analysis shows that this dual partition function, at η = 0, corresponds to the grand canonical
partition function of an ideal Fermi gas whose density matrix is given by (4.3).
It is well known [29, 59, 69, 70] that the 4 dimensional Nekrasov partition function reproduces
the Seiberg-Witten prepotential F0(a, Λ) and its gravitational corrections Fg(a, Λ) [71–74] in the
expansion

ZNek(, a, Λ) = exp

(4.17)

where  is the vacuum expectation value of the self-dual graviphoton ﬁeld strength. Our result
thus shows that all the gravitational corrections to the Seiberg–Witten theory are encoded in a
Fredholm determinant describing an ideal Fermi gas.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we proposed a new double scaling limit in which the spectral determinant of [23]
makes contact with the dual four dimensional SU (2) Nekrasov–Okounkov partition function and
with the Painlev´e III3 equation. We used the recent devolvements in the context of Painlev´e III3
[18–22], together with previous works on spectral determinants [28], to prove the conjecture of
[23] in this new double scaling limit of local P1 × P1. Within this construction we associated a
spectral problem to the Painlev´e III3 equation. More precisely, we showed that the vanishing
locus of the τ function introduced in [18–22] computes the spectrum of an ideal Fermi gas.
Interestingly, this gas appears in the computation of two-point functions for the 2d Ising model
and in the study of 2d polymers [28, 67]. It would be interesting to explore this relation more in
detail in view of the results presented here.

Physically our construction provides a description of the gravitational corrections to the
Seiberg–Witten theory in the self–dual Ω–background in terms of an ideal Fermi gas and its
spectral determinant representation.
In this work we focused on the pure SU (2) N = 2 four dimensional gauge theory. However,
it would be interesting to combine the techniques developed here with the work of [24] to study
the four dimensional gauge theory with matter. Moreover the case of higher rank gauge theory
should also be investigated. In this context, one can deform the theory to the generating function
of local BPS observables TrΦk, where Φ is the scalar component of the N = 2 vector multiplet.
It would be interesting to understand the counterpart of these deformations from the spectral
theory point of view.

The general solution to Painlev´e III3 equation contains an additional parameter η which is
set to zero in our construction. This suggests that a generalization of the spectral determinant
may exist including this extra parameter. It would be interesting to investigate its role in the
context of topological string.

A natural extension of this work is the generalization to the ﬁve dimensional case describing

the full topological string amplitude. We will report on this in the near future [75].

A Quantum A period

The notion of quantum A period was studied in the context of AGT correspondence [76–80] and
topological strings [81, 82]. It is the integral of a quantum diﬀerential over the A cycle of a given
curve. In the particular case of local P1 × P1 the quantum A period has been computed in [82]
and reads

partial resummation in t2 to obtain an expression which is valid around

where Fol(e−t2) is what we call the one loop contribution of standard topological strings.
In
appendix C we show that, when this is appropriately combined with the one loop contribution
of the NS free energy, one can resum it by using the methods of [52] .

Similarly, by using the reﬁned topological vertex one has

iei(cid:0)1 + ei(cid:1) e−t1

inst(t, ) =
F NS

(−1 + ei) (−e−t2 + ei) (−1 + e−t2ei)

C Integral representation for the one loop contribution

In this appendix we use the results of [52] to compute the one loop part (3.8) of the spectral
determinant (2.5). It was shown in [52] that

plus the one loop part of the NS limit of topological string sum up to give the non perturbative
free energy of topological string on the resolved conifold as given in [52].

D Spectral determinant and Painlev´e III equation

In this section we brieﬂy review the results of [28] providing a Fredholm determinant presentation
of a special solution to Painlev´e III3 equation. These results will be relevant in Section 3.

We deﬁne the Zamolodchikov spectral determinant ΞZ(κ, t) as

where

In the context of Painlev´e equations it useful to introduce the so called τ function which is related
to the solution of (D.6) as

e−iU (κ,t) =

log τ (t42−12, κ).

This means that

(D.9)

is the τ function corresponding to the solution of (D.6). The small t expansion of ΞZ(κ, t) was
also computed in [28] where the author shows that

The variable σ in (D.10) is related to κ through

it was shown in [28] that
