Abstract: Bogomol’nyi-Prasad-Sommerﬁeld solitons in models with spontaneously
broken gauge symmetry have been intensively studied at inﬁnite gauge coupling
limit, where the governing equation – so-called master equation – is exactly solvable.
Except of handful of special solutions, the standing impression is that analytic results
at ﬁnite coupling are generally unavailable. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate,
using domain walls in Abelian-Higgs models as a simplest example, that exact solitons
at ﬁnite gauge coupling can be readily obtained, if the number of Higgs ﬁelds (NF )
is large enough.
In particular, we present a family of exact solutions, describing
N domain walls at arbitrary positions in models with at least NF ≥ 2N + 1. We
have also found that adding together any pair of solution can produce a new exact
solution, if the combined tension is below certain limit.

Keywords: Topological solitons, Supersymmetry, exact solutions.

1. Introduction

Domain walls are planar-like objects, which separates two distinct phases/states of
matter. Perhaps the most iconic examples are walls in ferromagnets, where ‘domains’
of uniform orientation of magnetic moments are punctuated by thin layers, within
which moments change rapidly to accommodate the relative diﬀerence. Numerous
other examples can be found across solid-state physics. The concept, however, found
its place in various others ﬁelds. In theoretical physics, domain walls are often used
as low energy toy models of both D-branes [1, 2] in string theory and ‘branes’ in the
brane world scenario [3]. The lowest common denominator in all their incarnations,
however, is the existence of distinct phases/states of matter, which makes domain
walls prototypes of topological solitons [4].

To model a domain wall in ﬁeld theory, in principle all that is required are discreet
and degenerate vacua, which domain wall separates. The simplest example is a scalar
ﬁeld theory with the double-well potential, the well known Z2 kink [5]. However, in
generic scalar theories a conﬁguration of more than a one domain wall cannot be

static, due to attractive scalar forces. Dynamical multi-soliton conﬁgurations are
therefore diﬃcult to study in such theories, other than via numerical or perturbative
methods. Only in very special cases we are able to write-down exact dynamical
multi-soliton solutions, such as in the famous Sine-Gordon model.

Hence, to understand multi-domain walls (and many other topological solitons
as well), without the need of dealing with dynamics, it is advantageous to use super-
symmetric (SUSY) gauge theories. In these models attractive scalar forces between
solitons can be exactly compensated by repulsive massive vector interactions (origi-
nating from spontaneously broken gauge symmetry). Thus, arbitrary conﬁgurations
of solitons can be static. Solitons with such property are called Bogomol’nyi-Prasad-
Sommerﬁeld (BPS) solitons. They can be shown to posses the least amount of energy
in their topological sector (so-called Bogomol’nyi bound [6]) and they also partially
preserve SUSY.

BPS solitons have further advantage. Instead of dealing with complicated second-
order equations of motion, BPS solitons can be shown to satisfy much simpler set
of ﬁrst-order equations, correspondingly called the BPS equations. These equations
has many interesting properties and they attract scientiﬁc interest on their own.

If the gauge symmetry is only partially broken by scalar ﬁelds – the so-called
Coulomb phase – prototypal solitons are magnetic monopoles [7, 8] and to them
related instantons [9]. Their BPS equations can be solved exactly via the famous
Nahm equations [10] and ADHM construction [11], respectively, providing an analytic
form for static multi-monopole and multi-instanton conﬁgurations. This reﬂects the
underlying integrability of BPS equations in the Coulomb phase.

If the gauge symmetry is fully broken by scalar ﬁelds – the so-called Higgs phase
– the prototype solitons are vortices [12, 13, 14, 15] and domain walls [16, 17]. In
contrast with the Coulomb phase, similar analytic techniques for solving BPS equa-
tions in the Higgs phase are not available, as they are not integrable [18]. Although
isolated exact solutions were found for domain walls [19, 20], they only seem to prove
the general rule.

This paper is dedicated to extend the knowledge about exact solutions for solitons
in the Higgs phase. In particular, we concentrate on domain walls, but our results
have obvious implications to other BPS solitons in the Higgs phase.

We consider a part of the bosonic sector of Abelian N = 2 SUSY gauge theory
with NF Higgs ﬁelds. Such model has NF discreet vacua and consequently supports
conﬁgurations of up to NF − 1 elementary domain walls. We present the model in
detail in Sec. 2, where we also discuss properties of walls and of multi-wall conﬁgu-
rations at some length.

To construct BPS domain walls we employ the so-called moduli matrix approach
(for a review see [21]). This technique involves a change of variables which solves all
BPS equations identically, except one. The remaining equation, called the master

– 2 –

equation, has the following general form

1
˜g2 ∂2

xu = 1 − Ω0(x)e−u ,

(1.1)

where ˜g is proportional to the gauge coupling constant and u is the moduli ﬁeld
related to Higgs ﬁelds and gauge ﬁelds via the moduli matrix approach. We call
Ω0(x) the ‘source term’, since it speciﬁes number, mass and positions of walls. In
fact, together with the boundary condition u → log Ω0(x) at the spatial inﬁnity, Ω0
fully determines the solution.

Not surprisingly, the non-linear second order diﬀerential equation (1.1) is very
hard to solve exactly. Indeed, up to now there is only a handful of exact solutions for
special choices of Ω0. Chronologically, ﬁrst exact solution was a junction of domain
walls reported in [20]. From this solution, one can extract a single wall solution, which
was added to two other exact single wall solutions and one double wall solution in
[19]. Outside of these important ﬁndings, the master equation of the type (1.1) is
believed to be impregnable by analytic means.

In this paper, we will present many new exact solutions for multi-domain walls.
In particular, we will show that some exact solutions of (1.1), each with diﬀerent Ω0,
can be combined to gain novel solutions, with new Ω0’s. These solutions, which we
call chains, can under certain conditions generate unlimited wealth of exact solutions,
which we specify in Sec. 3. Furthermore, we will show that beyond chains there
is a bewildering maze of exact solutions based upon a family of ansatzes, which
we present and study in Sec. 4. Both of these ﬁndings reveal unexpected analytic
structure within master equation for domain walls and strongly implies the same for
other topological solitons. We will discuss these implications in Sec. 5.

2. Master equation for Abelian domain walls

2.1 Abelian-Higgs theory

Let us consider a U(1) gauge theory in (3+1)-dimensions1 with NF complex scalar
ﬁelds assembled into the row vector H ≡ (H 1, H 2, . . . , H NF ) and a real scalar ﬁeld
σ. The Lagrangian is given as:

1
2g2 (∂µσ)2 + |DµH|2 − V ,
+ |σH − HM|2 ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

1The number of spatial dimensions plays no role in our discussions. We keep it to be three
for simplicity, but all results presented in subsequent sections are valid in any number of spatial
dimensions.

with the so-called Fayet-Iliopoulous parameter. The mass matrix is given as M =
diag(m1, . . . , mNF ). Notice that the trace part of M can be changed arbitrarily by
shifting σ → σ + k, Tr[M] → Tr[M] − k, which leaves the Lagrangian unaﬀected.
We will use this freedom to make all entries in M negative (or zero) by setting
k = NF max{mi}. The beneﬁt of this choice will be apparent when we discuss
positions of domain walls. Also, we can always demand that the masses are ordered
m1 ≥ . . . ≥ mNF , without loss of generality. This makes m1 = 0.

We adopt following conventions:

ηµν = diag(+,−,−,−) ,
Fµν = ∂µwν − ∂νwµ ,
DµH = ∂µH + iwµH .

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

Non-generic values of coupling constants in front of (∂σ)2 and in the potential V
allow us to embed this model into a supersymmetric model with eight supercharges
by adding appropriate bosonic and fermionic ﬁelds. This ‘eﬀective’ supersymmetry
enables to reduce the full equations of motion by one order. The reduced equations
are known as 1/2 BPS equations.

Vacua of (2.1) are constant ﬁeld conﬁgurations with vanishing potential V = 0.
There are precisely NF such conﬁgurations, which we label as h1i , . . .hNFi, with the
representative values

H hki = (0, . . . , v

, . . . , 0) , σhki = mk ,

(k = 1, . . . , NF ) .

Existence of discreet vacua is what makes domains walls possible. To be speciﬁc,
since there are NF vacua we expect there to be a domain wall for every transition
between a pair of vacua hii−hji, where i < j (if i > j such transitions are called anti-
2 (cid:1) diﬀerent domain walls. Let us denote each transition
walls). Thus, there are(cid:0)NF −1
as hi ji for brevity. Out of these, only transitions between successive vacua hi i + 1i
are considered as ‘elementary’, while other transitions can be showed as composite
conﬁgurations of elementary walls, as we will discuss in subsection 2.3.

2.2 1/2 BPS equations

Let us construct 1/2 BPS domain walls along, say, the ﬁrst direction x1. To that
goal we will assume that all ﬁelds depend only on x1 coordinate and, as a gauge
choice, we take all gauge ﬁelds to be zero wµ = 0. The BPS equations are found
using the well-known technique of bounding the energy density from below due to

and ∆m is a diﬀerence of masses of respective vacua.2 The minimum E = ηT is
achieved if the following set of ﬁrst order equations are obeyed

∂1σ = ηg2(cid:0)v2 − |H|2(cid:1) .

(2.9)

(2.10)

Parameter η2 = 1 labels whether the solution is either a wall (η = 1) or an anti-wall
(η = −1).

BPS equations (2.9)-(2.10) can be reduced to a single second order partial diﬀer-
ential equation by using the moduli matrix approach [21]. First, let us solve Eq. (2.9)
identically using the ansatz

H = ve−u/2H0eηM x1

(2.11)

where u is a new ﬁeld variable and H0 is a row vector of NF constants, generically
called the moduli matrix. Notice that the pair {u, H0} does not determine {H, σ}
uniquely, since the so-called V -transformation {u, H0} → {u + 2c, ecH0}, where
c ∈ C, leave the assignment (2.11) unaltered. The second BPS equation (2.10) turns
into the master equation

1u = 1 − Ω0e−u , Ω0 = H0e2ηM x1

2.3 The master equation
As an explicit example, let us consider the case NF = 2, M = diag(0,−m). There is
only one domain wall h12i, which interpolates between the second vacuum σ → −m
at x1 → −∞ and the ﬁrst vacuum σ → 0 at x1 → ∞. Its tension is Th1 2i = v2m.

2Notice that due to the ordering of masses this quantity is always positive for walls η = 1 and

negative for anti-walls η = −1. In this way the combination η∆m = |∆m| is always positive.

The generic moduli matrix can be written as H0 = (1, emR) by ﬁxing the ﬁrst entry
via the V -transformation. Parameter R represents the position of the wall and we
can set R = 0 by translation symmetry. The master equation (2.12) in such a case
reduces to (x1 ≡ x, η = 1)

1
2g2v2 ∂2

xu = 1 −(cid:16)1 + e−2mx(cid:17)e−u .

(2.13)

The general solution of this equation is unknown, although three exact solutions
for speciﬁc values of the ratio m/(gv) have been found [19]. We will discuss these
solutions in the next section.

Apart from these solutions (or solving the master equation numerically) one can
develop a qualitative feeling about the shape of the solution via the so-called inﬁnite
gauge coupling limit g → ∞. Notice that in this limit the left-hand side of (2.13)
vanishes and right-hand side can be solved algebraically as

u∞ = log(cid:16)1 + e−2mx(cid:17) .

(2.14)

The diﬀerence between exact solution and u∞ is generally conﬁned to a ﬁnite region
around domain wall as illustrated on Fig. 1. Thus, the general shape of the solution is
faithfully represented by u∞. This is also the reason why the inﬁnite gauge coupling
limit is used almost exclusively in studies about BPS domain walls, or other solitons
in the Higgs phase.

Figure 1: Comparison between approximate u∞ solution (solid blue line) and exact uexact
solution (dashed yellow line) to the master equation (2.13). The values of parameters are
m = 1 and 2g2v2 = 1.

Let us now consider the case NF = 3 with mass matrix M = diag(0,−m,−2m).
It is easy to see that there are two elementary walls representing the transitions
h1 2i and h2 3i given by moduli matrices H0 = (1, 1, 0) and H0 = (0, 1, 1), respec-
tively. Indeed, these choices would produce essentially identical master equations as
in Eq. (2.13). On the other hand, if we choose H0 = (1, eR/2, 1) we obtain a new

2g2v2 ∂2

xu = 1 −(cid:16)1 + eRe−2mx + e−4mx(cid:17)e−u ,

(2.15)

which is the ﬁrst example of the so-called composite wall. This conﬁguration de-
scribes the transition h1 3i. Depending on the value of the parameter R, the con-
ﬁguration on its way from h1i vacuum at x → ∞ to h3i vacuum at x → −∞ can
approach the h2i vacuum arbitrarily close. For positive and large R we can interpret
the conﬁguration as a pair of elementary walls separated by the distance ∼ R/m.
Indeed, in the vicinity of the point x = R/(2m) + ˜x, where |˜x| ≪ R/(2m) we have
(2.16)

1
2g2v2 ∂2

xu ≈ 1 −(cid:16)1 + e−2m˜x + e−2R(cid:17)e−u ,

which is nearly the transition h1 2i up to the negligible term e−2R ≪ 1, while near
the point x = −R/(2m) + ˜x we get

1
2g2v2 ∂2

xu ≈ 1 −(cid:16)1 + e2R(cid:0)e−2m˜x + 1(cid:1)(cid:17)e−u .

(2.17)

We can shift the ﬁeld u → u + 2R to make the ﬁrst term in the parenthesis negligible,
thus approximately obtaining equation for the elementary wall h2 3i.

In other words, for suﬃciently big R the solution describes a pair of elementary

walls located at

x1 =

R
m

,

x2 = −

R
m

.

(2.18)

In the region between the walls, the ﬁelds H and σ are nearly at the second vacuum
and in the limit R → ∞, the whole conﬁguration becomes h2i. On the other hand,
when R is close to zero or negative the two walls merge together: they form so-
called ‘compressed’ wall. In the extreme limit R → −∞ the master equation (2.19)
reduces to (2.13) and we have pure transition h1 3i with a single domain wall. An
exact solution of Eq. (2.15) was reported [19]. Again, we will discuss it in the next
section.

Let us now make a few comments about the general case. For ease of reference
let us repeat here the master equation (2.12) in a fully unpacked way (x1 ≡ x, η = 1):

where hi are absolute values of moduli matrix H0 and mi are diagonal elements of

mi → mi − γ/2 ,

without changing the equation. This redundancy is a manifestation of V -transfor-
mation, translation invariance and reparametrization freedom of the mass matrix.
Generalizing what we learned in particular cases, there are NF − 1 elementary
walls hi i + 1i, which are obtained by setting hi = 1, hi+1 = 1 for i = (1, . . . , NF − 1)
and hj = 0 otherwise. On the other hand, if there are three or more non-zero moduli
parameters, we have a conﬁguration of two or more elementary walls. In maximal
case where all moduli are non-zero, we have everything between a system of well
separated NF − 1 elementary walls and a single domain wall h1 NFi.

Can we tell which elementary walls are compressed, which are isolated and at
what positions walls (compressed or elementary) roughly are just from moduli pa-
rameters? Yes. Let us concentrate on i-th elementary domain wall. We can estimate
its position by comparing the factors h2
i+ie2mi+ix on the right-hand side
of Eq. (2.19). If neither of these numbers (at given x) is signiﬁcantly bigger than the
remaining factors in Eq. (2.19) we are nowhere close to either hii or hi + 1i vacuum
and hence we are also far away from hi i + 1i-th wall. On the other hand, if one
of these numbers is much bigger then the rest, we are close to the corresponding
vacuum, but again not close to the wall. Obviously, both factor must be equally
dominant over remaining terms, in order to be close to i-th elementary wall. The
point where both factors equal is

i e2mix and h2

xi = log(cid:0)hi+1/hi(cid:1)/(mi − mi+1) .

(2.23)

But xi will faithfully represent position of the wall only if the numbers h2
i e2mixi and
i+ie2mi+ixi really are much bigger then all remaining factors. This happens when
h2
i-th wall is isolated from its neighbours, that is if xi−1 ≪ xi ≪ xi+1. If for example
xi−1 is close or bigger than xi then both elementary walls are compressed with each
other and located at the center of mass of the two wall system:

˜xi =

(mi − mi+1)xi + (mi−1 − mi)xi−1

mi−1 − mi+1

=

1

mi−1 − mi+1

log(cid:16)hi+1/hi−1(cid:17) .

(2.24)

This is so because ordering of masses mi ≥ mi+1 implies that vacua, which are
visited by the conﬁguration along the x-axis, must be ordered as well. Therefore, the
elementary domain walls cannot have arbitrary positions and in fact i-th wall must
be placed on the right side of (i + 1)-th wall.

In general, if we work out the values of all xi, i = 1, . . . , NF −1 given in Eq. (2.23)
the ordering of these points tell us which walls are isolated and which are compressed.
If they are ordered as x1 ≫ . . . ≫ xNF −1, there are NF − 1 isolated walls located
approximately at those points. In the other extreme, if the center of mass of ﬁrst
NF − 2 elementary walls ˜x is smaller than xNF −1, then there is only one compressed
domain wall located at their mutual center of mass.

From Eq. (2.23) we see that not all hi’s are necessary to describe positions of
walls. We can use the symmetry transformation (2.20)-(2.22) to reduce their number

– 8 –

by two. Let us ﬁx this freedom and rewrite moduli hi into the standard form, where
their meaning becomes more transparent:

hi =

i−1

Yj=1

eRj ,

i = (1, . . . NF − 1) .

(2.25)

By virtue of this assignment h1 = 1. New parameters Ri ≡ xi(mi − mi+1) are
weighted positions of the walls. Since the position of the center-of-mass of the entire
system is not very interesting moduli, let us ﬁx it at x = 0.
In other words we
demand R1 + . . . + RNF −1 = 0. This makes hNF = 1. Furthermore, we will ﬁx
the remaining symmetry by demanding that m1 = 0. We will call a conﬁguration of
domain walls with center of mass ﬁxed at origin and m1 = 0 a balanced conﬁguration.
Any initially unbalanced conﬁguration of domain walls, that is h1 6= 1, hNF 6= 1 and
m1 6= 0 can be turned into a balanced one via the following transformation of the
solution u(x) → u(x + α) + β + 2m1x, where

2.4 Crude model of the domain wall

The domain wall is known to posses a three-layered structure [22, 21]. The outer
two layers of the domain wall are customary called the ‘skin’ and here we call the
inner layer the ‘core’. The skin is characterized by rapid decay of the corresponding
Higgs ﬁeld, from the asymptotic value H = v in the vacuum outside of the domain
wall to (almost) zero. The core is a region where all Higgs ﬁelds remains very close
to zero. This means that in the core the gauge symmetry is almost restored, and
we can understand the skin as a transitional region from the spontaneously broken
phase outside of the domain wall to the unbroken phase in the core.

The core, however, is not present for all domain walls, but it develops only when
the total tension is suﬃciently big. Let us again consider the NF = 2 example with
the mass matrix M = diag(0,−m) and H0 = (1, 1). On Fig. 2 we show energy
density proﬁles of three domain walls with increasing values of total tension. The
three-layered structure is most visible for the heaviest wall, where the plateau in the
energy density is clearly present. The lightest wall is visibly core-less and has only
skin, while the middle wall is just at the point, where core starts to develop.

The existence of the core can be partially understood from the BPS equations
(2.9)-(2.10).
In particular, the second equation (2.10) can be seen as a condition
that the value of the tension density v2∂xσ cannot be at any point higher than g2v4
(In Fig. 2 this value is exactly 0.125). Notice that this upper bound can be reached
only when Higgs ﬁelds are zero, which is the unbroken phase. Hence, if we assume

– 9 –

Figure 2: Numerical solution of the master equation with Ω0 = 1 + e−2mx, illustrating the
diﬀerence in shape of tension density v2∂2
xu/2 for various values of total tension T . We see
that core of the domain wall (the plateau) develops only when total tension is suﬃciently
big.

that the (maximal) skin energy is independent on the mass (as we will show is the
case) and that the total tension v2∆m is signiﬁcantly higher than gv3, the core of
the domain wall must develop, in order to store the excess energy.

This observation implies that the eﬀective radius of the core is linearly propor-
tional to the tension, Rc ∼ ∆m. In fact, ignoring skin altogether we easily estimate
Rc by comparing energy inside the core g2v4Rc to the total energy v2∆m, thus ob-
taining Rc ∼ ∆m
g2v2 .

We can gain much more insight into the structure of the domain wall by imagining
very crude model as depicted on Fig. 3. There, we take the Higgs ﬁelds as piece-wise
linear functions. Outside the domain wall they are exactly ﬁxed at given vacua (h1i
on the right side an h2i on the left side). Inside the skin they linearly fall to zero
across the interval of size Rs and remains vanishing in the core of width Rc.

The σ ﬁeld is determined by demanding that it is a continuous function and
inside every region a solution of the second BPS equation (2.10). Carrying out the
integration of Eq. (2.10) in each region we ﬁnd

The integration constants are ﬁxed in the following way. In the core we demand
σcore(0) = −m/2 by reﬂection symmetry. In both skins we determine the integration
constants by sewing the σright skin and σleft skin with σcore at the points x = ±Rc/2.
Interestingly, remaining continuity conditions σright skin = σh1i and σleft skin = σh2i

By symmetry we have Tskin = 2Tright skin = v2m−g2v2Rc. Combining this with the
tension of the core Tcore = g2v2Rc we see that in total we have T = Tskin + Tcore =
v2m, as it should be.

However, not all of the energy has been accounted for. Notice that at the core
and in the vacua our ﬁelds are exact BPS solutions, while in the skin only the second
BPS equation (2.10) is satisﬁed. This means that besides the tension T there is an
additional energy contribution Eextra coming from the violation of of the ﬁrst BPS

where we have used the relation (2.33). We want this term to be as small as possible.
Remarkably, Eextra is strictly positive with a unique minimum at

Thus, using our crude model we managed to ﬁnd formulas relating width of the core

which are in full accordance with the previous estimates found in [22, 21]. As per our
intuitive understanding, the core develops only when tension of the domain wall is
suﬃciently big. More precisely, the crude model gives us an estimate Tmin ≈ 4.63gv3,
which corresponds to Rc = 0 value.3 The numerical analysis conﬁrms that the
formulas in Eq. (2.37) are working. For illustration, we show the comparison of the
crude model with a particular numerical solution on Fig. 4.

3One can imagine modiﬁed versions of the crude model, where the Higgs ﬁelds in the skin
can deviate from a straight line. For example, if we assume sine-like proﬁle and follow the same
procedure as in the linear case, we obtain the formulas

which gives slightly larger estimate Tmin ≈ 5.9gv3. Intuitively, more closer to the actual solution
the proﬁle in the skin is, more energy is shifted from the core to the skin, giving us higher values
for Tmin. In that sense, the value of the crude model Tmin ≈ 4.63gv3 can be seen as a lower bound.

3. Chains of walls

Any domain wall solution of the master equation (2.12) is fully speciﬁed by the source
term Ω0, which in turn depends on the mass matrix M and on (absolute value of)
the moduli matrix H0. However, given Ω0 it is not possible to reconstruct M and H0
unambiguously, as we can always include any number of zero elements inside H0 or
degenerate entries in M. This eﬀectively lifts the solution to a model with arbitrary
large number of Higgs ﬁelds NF . Thus, in the rest of the paper, when we specify a
mass matrix M or a moduli matrix H0 we always refer to the minimal model, which
can be ascertain unambiguously.

In this section we present an inﬁnite amount of exact solutions for the master
equation (2.12). We do this by ﬁrst presenting two new single wall solutions – or
one-chains – and then we show that simple addition of these yields new multi-wall
solutions – or multi-chains – provided that certain restriction on parameters holds.

The existence of such solutions might be surprising, given the non-linearity of the
master equation. However, it is important to keep in mind, that for each solution
the source term Ω0 is diﬀerent. To be precise, if we link a single wall solution
to an existing chain, two things happen. First the (minimal) model, where the
If we denote the mass matrix of the n-chain as M (n)
solution lives, is enlarged.
and a mass matrix of the link as M (1), the new chain’s mass matrix is given as
M (n+1) = M (n) ⊕ M (1), where by ⊕ we mean all possible pairings of elements from

– 13 –

both matrices.4 The moduli matrices of the chain and newly added link combine in
a much more complicated fashion.

Second, the constraint on the parameters, which is present to ensure the validity
of the solution, becomes more strict. Roughly speaking, the maximum tension per
individual wall is decreased. As we will argue, this tightening occurs primarily to
prevent a violation of the no-go policy:

No cores for exact walls

This is the key observation of this paper. As far as we know there is no exact solution
of domain wall with a core. If such solutions exist at all, they are certainly out of the
reach of methods used in this paper. The search for an exact domain wall solution
with a core remains an interesting open problem.

Another peculiarity of exact solutions presented in this paper is that there are
always non-elementary walls. Expect few cases, which we show in the next subsection
and which were already reported elsewhere [19], we have found no exact solution with
isolated elementary walls. In fact, the number of separable wall through the moduli
parameters in the solutions themselves is always less than the number of elementary
domain wall of the model. In short, our solutions cover only subspaces of the full
moduli space.

In the following two subsections we present all one-chains, two-chains and three-
chains. We will shortly discuss their properties, but we mainly focus on three char-
acteristics: 1) the minimal number of ﬂavors, 2) the condition that ensures their
validity and 3) check that they have no cores. Based on these particular exam-
ples, in the third subsection we provide general formulas of these characteristic for
arbitrary N-chains.

3.1 Exact one-chains

In the paper [19] three exact single wall solutions were presented. In our notation,
they read

T = √2gv3,
T = √8gv3,
√2gv3.

T =

Here we have decorated each solution by the number of ﬂavors in the superscript and
by a roman numeral in the subscript for ease of reference. We have also kept the

parameter m, although m = √2gv holds for all three solutions, to keep the formulas
simple.

Solutions (3.2)-(3.4) are remarkable for many reasons, two of which are par-
ticularly relevant here. First, they are the only instances of exact elementary do-
main walls. As we stated, all other exact solutions presented in this paper are
non-elementary walls. Secondly, all walls are core-less, since T < Tmin ≈ 4.63gv3.
In other words, these walls are not heavy enough to have cores, as we discussed in
subsection 2.4.

Can we make chains out of u2F
I

III? In general, no. The only exception
is a remarkable double wall solution also reported in [19], which in our notation reads

I (x) = 2 log(cid:0)1 +p6 + eR e−mx + e−2mx(cid:1) ,
Ω0 = 1 + eRe−2mx + e−4mx , m = √2gv .

(3.5)

(3.6)

The parameter R/m can be interpreted as a separation of walls if R ≫ m, while
for R ∼ m or less the walls are compressed. As already noted in [19], u3F
can be
rewritten as:

is a solution of a 3F model,
written as a sum of two 2F domain walls and the mass matrix equals to the direct
sum: M = diag(0, m, 2m) = diag(0, m)⊕diag(0, m). A peculiar feature of u3F
is that
it is undeﬁned for |S| < |Smin| ≡ 1
2m arcosh(2), which would cause R to be complex.
In fact, at |S| = |Smin| the solution u3F
II , which is an elementary wall.
This peculiarity, however, seems to be isolated only to this 2-chain.

I becomes u2F

I

With the exception of (3.7), no other chains can be constructed out of (3.2)-
III. Quick calculation reveals that the function

III(x + S) is a solution to the master equation for the source term

(3.4). Let us illustrate this on u2F
u2F
III(x − S) + u2F

Ω0 = 1 − 9e−2mx + eRe−3mx − 9e−4mx + e−6mx ,

(3.8)

where R is again a function of S. As we see, H0 is ill-deﬁned given the negative
signs in front of e−2mx and e−4mx. Indeed, these would imply complex positions for
ﬁrst and third elementary domain walls (see Eq. (2.23)). Therefore, u2F
III cannot be
chained. Same problems arise for any diﬀerent combination of solutions (3.2)-(3.4).
At this point we need new exact solutions. There are two, which we have found.

The ﬁrst is obtained by relaxing the constraint on the parameter m in u2F

I (x):

II (x) = 2 log(cid:0)1 + e−mx(cid:1) ,

within the range 0 < m2 ≤ 2g2v2. This solution lives in 3F model with the mass
matrix M (1) = −diag(0, m, 2m)/2. From Eq. (2.23) we can calculate (naive) positions
of elementary walls to be

But since x1 < x2 both walls are compressed and there is, in fact, only a single wall
with the tension T 3F

m2 → 2g2v2 the compression becomes inﬁnite x1 → −∞, x2 → ∞ and we return to
the original solution u2F

.

Unlike u3F
I

, our new solution does not have a moduli, which controls separation
of elementary walls. In other words, this solution covers only a subspace of the full
moduli space of the (minimal) model, where it lives. Also notice that the amount of
compression for both elementary walls is very speciﬁc m-dependent number. If the
numbers x1 and x2 in Eq. (3.11) were only slightly diﬀerent, no corresponding exact
solution is known to the author. The reason – if there is one – why only such a special
arrangement of elementary walls allows exact solution, while other arrangements do
not, remains elusive.

The second exact solution is constructed similarly by relaxing mass constraint
III:

solution is restored in the limit m2 → 2g2v2, as before. The tension is never greater

3.2 Exact two-chains and three-chains

Let us ﬁrst investigate a two-chain made of equal tension u3F

II walls. That is:

I (x) = u3F

II (x + S; m) + u3F

II (x − S; m) ,
2g2v2(cid:1) + 2e−2mx(cid:0)2 + cosh(2mS) − 2m2

+ 4e−3mx cosh(mS)(cid:0)1 − m2
2g2v2(cid:1) + e−4mx .
M = M (1)(m) ⊕ M (1)(m) = −diag(0, m, 2m, 3m, 4m)/2 .

(3.18)

(3.19)

This two-chain lives in 5F model with the mass matrix

u4F

Notice that the (minimal) number of ﬂavors of u5F
is not always ﬁve, but can be lower
I
for special values of m or S (or both). For example, taking the limit m2 → 2g2v2
eliminates two factors from its Ω0, which means that the resulting solution has only
2m arcosh(cid:0)2 −
three ﬂavors. Incidentally, this solution is u3F
I
2m2

. Also, by choosing S = 1

g2v2(cid:1) we can nullify third term in (3.18), which gives us a new 4F solution
m2
2g2v2 ≤ 1 ,
2 + e−4mx .

II (x) = 2 log(cid:16)1 + 2e−mxq m2

(3.21)

and taking again the limit m2 → 2g2v2 in this solution gives us u2F
II .

Generally, all chains can be reduced in a similar manner to a sequence of new
exact solutions, which however possess less parameters than their parent solutions.
We will investigate these ‘reductions’ in detail in Sec. 4, since their exact structure
becomes quickly very complicated for higher number of ﬂavors. In the remainder of
this section, we will skip these considerations entirely, for brevity.

g2v2 − 1

Before going further, let us discuss a methodology, how we determine under
which condition any chain is a valid solution of the master equation (2.12). For
simple solutions such as u5F
II this can be done by inspection, but for more
I
complicated ones, we need to establish a clear criterium.

and u4F

As we saw in the example of a false two-chain made out of u2F

III in Eq. (3.8), the
issue is that we have to guarantee that moduli matrix H0 is well deﬁned or, more

– 17 –

simply, that all coeﬃcients multiplying exponential factors in Ω0 are positive num-
bers. These coeﬃcients, however, are generally complicated functions of distances
between walls, which makes the analysis very cumbersome. Fortunately, in order to
obtain a general condition for any arrangement of walls we only need to look at the
coincident case, where all walls sits on the same point on the x-axis, say the origin.
At this limit, all coeﬃcients in Ω0 reach their lowest values.

Why it is so? Let us illustrate this on an example of a generic two-chain made

of single-wall solutions u1 and u2, where

1
2g2v2 ∂2

xu1 = 1 − Ω(1)

0 e−u1 ,

1
2g2v2 ∂2

xu2 = 1 − Ω(2)

The master equation for u1 + u2 can be rewritten as

1
2g2v2 ∂2

x(u1 + u2) = 2 − Ω(1)
= 1 − Ω(1)
= 1 − Ω(1)
= 1 −(cid:16)Ω(1)

Thus, the two-chain u1 + u2 solves the master equation with the source term

has two parts. The ﬁrst part is manifestly positive since Ω(1)

Ω(1+2)
0 has only
positive coeﬃcients. The second part is proportional to tension densities of both
solutions and hence (given the minus sign) is manifestly negative. Thus, the coeﬃ-
cients in Ω(1+2) are lowest if the second term is (in absolute sense) largest. But this
happens precisely when domain walls from ﬁrst and second solution are coincident,
because the product of their tension densities ∼ ∂2
xu2 is largest there. Hence, our
claim holds. Notice that this argument can be trivially extended to any number of
walls. Therefore, the criterium, which ensures well-deﬁned H0 for any exact solution,
is established by looking at the lowest coeﬃcient in Ω0 at the coincident point.

Notice that this is more stringent than for individual one-chains, where the condi-
tion was m2 ≤ 2g2v2. This is intuitively understandable from the point of view of
no-cores-for-exact-solutions philosophy. Since the tensions of individual links in the
chain add up linearly, the restriction on them must be larger, compared to restric-
tions on links themselves. If that were not the case, a suﬃciently long chain would
eventually break the threshold for developing a core. And indeed, with the more
stringent restriction the maximum tension density for our 2-chain is well bellow the
threshold

II (x − S2; m2) .

(3.28)

This two-chain is a special case of a more general solution designated as u9F
which is studied in detail in Sec 4. We count 9 ﬂavors. The mass matrix

IV (x),

M = M (1)(m1) ⊕ M (1)(m2)

= −diag(0, m1, m2, m1 + m2, 2m1, 2m2, 2m1 + m2, m1 + 2m2, 2m1 + 2m2)/2

is again given by considering all possible pairings between matrix elements of its
single wall constituents. At the coincident point (S1 = S2 = 0) we have

1

Ω0 = 1 + 2(cid:0)1 − m2
+ e−2m1x + e−2m2x + 4(cid:16)1 − m2

Thus, the solution u9F

IV is valid if

many characteristic of the chain changes discontinuously, for diﬀerent levels of mass-
degeneracies. For example, the number of elementary walls is now eight, indicating
that both walls are composites of four, rather than two elementary walls, as is the
case when we look at each u3F
link independently. Thus, when m1 6= m2 the act
II
of combining both solutions changes their nature. Nothing of this sort happens in
equal tension case.

where X ∈ {1 ≡ u3F

for each link Xi(mi). But, as was the case for 2-chains and 3-chains, all characteristics
of interest, such as number of ﬂavors NF , condition ensuring validity of solution and
Tmax, change discontinuously across degeneracies. This means that taking limits
of parameters mi in formulas found for non-degenerate case does not give correct
formulas for partially degenerate cases. Therefore, the goal of this subsection is
to develop general formulas for all three observables, which apply for all possible
degeneracies of parameters mi from the beginning.

Table 2: All 3-chains.

Let us start with the number of ﬂavors NF . The rule of thumb turns out to be
that for the links with the same mi, the number of ﬂavors minus one add up, while
for links with diﬀerent mi, ﬂavors multiply. Let us illustrate this on two extreme
examples. First, consider a totally degenerate chain made out of N − l 1-links and l
2-links:

(cid:16)N −l
Mi=1

1(m)(cid:17) ⊕(cid:16) l
Mj=1

2(m)(cid:17) ≡ 1N −l(m) ⊕ 2l(m) .

(3.34)

i=1 X(m). The solution at the

coincident point is given as

Here we introduced a shorthand notation Xn(m) ≡Ln
u = log(cid:16)1 + e−mx(cid:17)2N +l

.

(3.35)

The number of ﬂavors NF is simply the number of distinct exponentials in Ω0, or
equivalently in eu. This gives us the result

NF = 2N + l + 1 ,

(3.36)

which is simply the number of diﬀerent powers of e−mx in (1 + e−mx)2N +l, including
zero power. Notice that the number of elementary domain walls can be rewritten as
NF − 1 = 2(N − l) + 3l. At the same time, 1-link is composed of two, while 2-link
is composed of three elementary domain walls. Therefore, in totally degenerate case
the elementary walls which simply add up.

– 21 –

For a second example let us consider a totally non-degenerate chain:

(cid:16)N −l
Mi=1

1(mi)(cid:17) ⊕(cid:16) l
Mj=1

2(mj)(cid:17) ⇒ u = log(cid:18)N −l

Yi=1(cid:0)1 + e−mix(cid:1)2

l

Yj=1(cid:0)1 + e−mj x(cid:1)3(cid:19) . (3.37)

Counting the number of distinct exponential in eu we obtain

NF = 3N −l4l

(3.38)

Here we see the multiplication rule: Each 1 links contributes three ﬂavors and each
2 link gives four ﬂavors.

A generic case can be characterized by partial degeneracy of the parameters mi
i=1 di. Within each group di − li are
1-links and li are 2-links. The solution at the coincident point of such chain reads

into k ≤ N groups of size di, where N = Pk
Mi=1(cid:0)1di−li(mi) ⊕ 2li(mi)(cid:17) ⇒ u = log(cid:18) k

k

Yi=1(cid:16)1 + e−mix(cid:17)2di+li(cid:19) .

(3.39)

Within a degenerate group the number of ﬂavors follow the additive rule of Eq. (3.36),
that is we have 2di + li + 1 distinct exponentials for each group. These numbers must
are then multiplied as per the rule in Eq. (3.38). Thus, the most general formula for
arbitrary N-chain reads

NF =

k

Yi=1(cid:0)2di + li + 1(cid:1) .

(3.40)

It is easy to check that the results in the second columns in tables 1 and 2 are
concurrent to the above formula.

Let us now establish the condition under which arbitrary N-chain is a valid
solution of the master equation (2.12). Following the discussion in the previous
subsection we must investigate the lowest coeﬃcient in Ω0 at the coincident point.
For the most general N chain given in Eq. (3.39) we have

Ω0 =

k

Yj=1(cid:16)1 + e−mj x(cid:17)2dj +lj(cid:18)1 −

k

Xi=1

(2di + li)m2
i

2g2v2

e−mix

(cid:0)1 + e−mix(cid:1)2(cid:19) .

(3.41)

Now we extract the lowest coeﬃcient. Let us ﬁrst write down the largest factor
coming from the negative half (the second term in the large parenthesis) of Ω0:

−

k

Xi=1(cid:18) 2di + li − 2

2⌋ − 1(cid:19)Yj6=i(cid:18) 2dj + lj
dj + ⌊ lj

di + ⌊ li

2 ⌋(cid:19)(2di + li)m2

i

exp(cid:0)−

– 22 –

k

Xn=1(cid:0)dn + ⌊ ln

2 ⌋(cid:1)mnx(cid:1) ,

(3.42)

where ⌊x⌋ is the ﬂoor function. Simply put, we have expanded each bracket in the
product and picked out the largest factor, which is in the middle of the binomial
series. The factor with the same power in the exponential in the positive half reads

k

Yi (cid:18) 2di + li

di + ⌊ li

2⌋(cid:19) exp(cid:0)−

k

Xn=1(cid:0)dn + ⌊ ln

2 ⌋(cid:1)mnx(cid:1) .

(3.43)

Combining both factors together and demanding that the overall coeﬃcient is non-
negative we ﬁnd the condition for arbitrary N-chain to be

k

Xi=1 (cid:0)di + ⌊ li+1

2 ⌋(cid:1)(cid:0)di + ⌊ li
2⌋(cid:1)
2di + li − 1

i ≤ 2g2v2 .
m2

(3.44)

Let us consider few examples. The totally degenerate case is given by setting
k = 1, m1 ≡ m and d1 = N. Taking l1 ≡ l out of N walls to be 2-links we have the
conditions

(l is even) m2 ≤

4g2v2
N + l

2(cid:16)1 −

1

2N + l(cid:17) ,

(l is odd) m2 ≤

4g2v2
N + l+1
2

.

(3.45)

On the other hand in the fully non-degenerate case k = N, di = 1, li ∈ {0, 1} the
general condition (3.44) reduces to

N

Xi=1

m2
i ≤ 2g2v2 ,

(3.46)

which is curiously independent on all li’s. Again, the validity of the condition (3.44)
for two-chains and three-chains can be checked by looking at the result in Tabs. 1-2.

The remaining task is to ﬁnd a general formula for Tmax, deﬁned as

For the generic N-chain of Eq. (3.39) we ﬁnd

Tmax ≡

v2

Tmax =

u′′(0)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)coincident walls
Xi=1(cid:0)2di + li(cid:1)m2

i .

k

v2
8

We need to ﬁnd maximum of this. From the formula (3.44) we see that the upper
bound for a i-th factor in the above sum is given as

(3.47)

(3.48)

(3.49)

(3.50)

This can be simpliﬁed to

(2di + li)m2

(2di + li)m2

(cid:0)di + ⌊ li+1

i ≤ 2g2v2 (2di + li − 1)(2di + li)
2⌋(cid:1) .
2 ⌋(cid:1)(cid:0)di + ⌊ li
2 ⌋(cid:1)(cid:17) .
2(cid:0)di + ⌊ li+1

i ≤ 8g2v2(cid:16)1 −

1

– 23 –

Obviously, the maximum of the sum of these numbers amounts to picking up such
i ≡ n for which 2dn + ln ≥ 2di + li for i = 1, . . . , k. Then, the sum in Eq. (3.48) is
maximized by taking mi = 0 for i 6= n. In summary, the formula for maximum of
the tension density for generic N-chain reads

Tmax = g2v4(cid:16)1 −

1

2 ⌋(cid:1)(cid:17) .
2(cid:0)dn + ⌊ ln+1

(3.51)

Its validity for 2-chains and 3-chains can be checked by comparing with the ﬁndings
in the third columns of Tabs. 1-2. We see that Tmax is always less than g2v4 as
expected. The closest approach is achieved by fully degenerate 2 chains, that is
dn = N and l = N:

Tmax = g2v4(cid:16)1 −
Tmax = g2v4(cid:16)1 −

1

3N(cid:17) ,
3N + 1(cid:17) .

(N is even)

(N is odd)

(3.52)

(3.53)

In other words |Tmax − g2v4| ∼ 1/N for N ≫ 1. This might seem that for suﬃciently
big chains, the core should appear as the gap between Tmax and g2v4 closes. However,
this is misleading, because we are only looking at the hight of the peak. But its full
shape for fully degenerate 2-chain is

In other words, increase in N causes only widening of the peak and not development
of the plateau as seen in Fig. 2. This clearly conﬁrms no-core rule for exact solution,
as far as chains are concerned.

Let us close this section by commenting on the issue of inﬁnite chains. Periodic
domain wall solutions, or other exact inﬁnite wall conﬁgurations are potentially very
interesting objects, worth studying on their own. However, the chains presented
here cannot be extended to inﬁnite case. The obstacle can be clearly seen from the
condition (3.44), which implies that as N → ∞, the parameters vanish mi → 0.
More simply, if we look again at fully degenerate 2 chain as an illustrative example,
we see that the amount of tension per wall decreases:

gv3 , N ≫ 1 .
In other words, taking N to inﬁnity, the chain disappears.

4. Hierarchy of exact solutions

Rather than focusing on particular type of exact solutions – like chains of the previous
section – in this part we want to exhaust all exact solutions, which can be written
as logarithm of sum of exponentials. To that goal, in the ﬁrst subsection we present
a convenient ansatz, or rather a class of ansatzes. We devote later subsections to
investigate ﬁrst few smallest domain wall conﬁgurations as examples, highlighting
the main point of this section. That it, that all exact solutions form hierarchy,
where any particular solution might be seen as a special limit in parameter space of
another solution, living in larger model. Unlike for chains, these relations turn out
to be increasingly complicated as the minimal number of ﬂavors of the underlying
model increases. In particular, in this section we explore these relations in detail up
to NF = 10 ﬂavors.

For simplicity, throughout this section we ﬁx the eﬀective gauge coupling param-

stated. Any solution u(x; mi) at unit eﬀective gauge coupling can be rescaled to

eter ˜g ≡ √2gv appearing in the master equation (2.19) to ˜g = 1 unless otherwise
arbitrary case as u(cid:0)˜g x; mi/˜g(cid:1).

4.1 Ansatz

Let us consider the function

u(N )

(x) ≡ 2 log FN (x) ≡ 2 log(cid:16)1 +

N

Xi=1

i

Yj=1

eRi−mix(cid:17)

(4.1)

That is in particular

u(1)

u(3)

u(2)

1 (x) = 2 log(cid:16)1 + eR1e−m1x(cid:17) ,
1 (x) = 2 log(cid:16)1 + eR1e−m1x + eR1+R2e−(m1+m2)x(cid:17) ,
1 (x) = 2 log(cid:16)1 + eR1e−m1x + eR1+R2e−(m1+m2)x + eR1+R2+R3e−(m1+m2+m3)x(cid:17) .
The reason why we choose the ansatz (4.1) in this way is that vanishing of any
of mi’s reduce the N-th solution to the N − 1 case. Therefore, it is suﬃcient just
to study strictly positive values of mi’s. Also, all powers of e−x are automatically
ordered since 0 < m1 < m1 + m2 < . . .. This allow us to easily estimate the positions
of all (separable) walls, using similar arguments to those in Sec. 2: we look at points
where a pair of neighbouring exponentials equals:

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

˜x1 =

R1
m1

,

˜x2 =

R2
m2

,

. . .

˜xN =

RN
mN

.

(4.5)

Of course, these numbers represents actual locations of domain walls if they are
ordered ˜x1 ≫ ˜x2 ≫ . . . ≫ ˜xN , in the same way as we discussed for positions of

– 25 –

elementary walls in Eq. (2.23). Also notice that parameters mi entering (4.1) are not
equal to the masses of the model, but they are related to them (see Eq. (4.16)).

The crucial detail in our ansatz is the factor 2 in front of the logarithm, since it
makes Ω0 automatically a ﬁnite sum of exponentials. Indeed, one can easily see that
the general form is given as

We count 3, 6 and 10 independent ﬂavors (terms) respectively, assuming generic
mi’s. The (unordered) mass matrix and the real part of the moduli matrix are given
in each case as:

Inspection of the above moduli matrices reveals that in order to have well deﬁned
solution the parameters m1, m2 and m3 must be constrained. In the N = 1 case,

– 26 –

only m1 ≤ 1 is allowed due to the square root in the second entry. In N = 2 case the
similar condition reads m1 + m2 ≤ 1, while in the N = 3 case it is m1 + m2 + m3 ≤ 1.
In other words, within the parameter m-space the regions corresponding to sensible
solutions are N-simplexes.

For general case the number of ﬂavors is NF = (cid:0)N +2

the real part of the moduli matrix can be schematically written as (restoring generic

Notice that this condition restrict the total tension T = v2Pi mi to be at most
T ≤ √2gv3. This conﬁrms, at lest for generic parameters, that no domain wall in

(4.1) has a core (see discussion in Sec. 2.4).

In summary, the solution (4.1) describe a conﬁguration of N domain walls with
tensions Ti = v2mi at (naive) positions xi given in Eq. (4.5), provided that (4.18) is

And similar relations apply for higher N cases. We can understand this as a kind of
‘non-linear’ chains. However, if we rephrase everything in terms of v(x) ≡ eu(x)/2 − 1
everything becomes linear too. In particular, the master equation turns into

v(3)
1 (x) = v1(x; m1) + v1(x; m1 + m2) + v1(x; m1 + m2 + m3) .

And analogously for higher N.

The ansatz (4.1) is not the only one we can consider. We may also take

The main focus of our analysis is to ﬁnd special relations between parameters mi
and Ri, which reduce the given solution to another solution in the model with lesser
number of ﬂavors. These reductions can be achieved in two complementary ways.
First, we can make some entries of the moduli matrix (4.17) to vanish. In m-space
such instances corresponds to the (part of) the boundary of the N-simplex, within
which the solutions are valid. The second way is to make some entries of the mass
matrix (4.16) equal. As we will see, these relations represents special ‘cuts’ of the N-
simplex. If two such cuts intersects, further reduction occurs along this intersection,
etc. The biggest reduction within this approach occurs when all mi’s are equal. In
such case the ansatz (4.1) is reduced to a degenerate 1 N-chain, described in the
previous section.

The combination of both way leads to an intricate web of exact solutions, which
we call the hierarchy. We can view each solution in the family (4.1) as a special parent
solution, which gives many child solutions via applying these reductions. Further-
more, each child can have their own children. Each reduction eﬀectively represents a
loss of one freedom, either the freedom to control tensions of individual walls (given
by parameters mi) or their mutual separations (parameters Ri). Solutions, which
does not have any free parameters are irreducible and they are terminating points of
the hierarchy.

Let us illustrate these general remarks on the concrete examples. Throughout
this subsection we will revive the practice, which we introduced below Eq. (3.4), that
we decorate each new solution by the number of ﬂavors in the superscript and by a
roman numeral in the subscript (distinguishing solutions of the same ﬂavor number)
for ease of reference.

4.2.1 N = 1

Let us repeat the solution and Ω0 for reference:

u(1)
1 ≡ u3F

II (x) = 2 log(cid:0)1 + e−mx(cid:1) , Ω0 = 1 + 2(cid:0)1 − m2(cid:1)e−mx + e−2mx .

For simplicity we have denoted m1 ≡ m and set the moduli R1 = 0. The mass matrix
and (real part of) the moduli matrix reads

(4.31)

M = −diag(cid:0)0 , m , 2m(cid:1)/2 ,
H0 = (1,√2 − 2m2, 1) .

The allowed range of the parameter m is the 1-simplex, the interval [0, 1]. The (naive)
positions of elementary walls are

x1 =

x2 = −

log(cid:0)2 − 2m2(cid:1) ,
log(cid:0)2 − 2m2(cid:1) .

(4.34)

(4.35)

Within the 1-simplex x1 ≤ x2, so elementary walls are compressed into a single wall
located at origin (their center of mass). The only reduction of number of ﬂavors can
be achieved by setting m = 1, which makes the second entry in the moduli matrix
zero. From the above formulas we can see that in this limit the compression becomes
inﬁnite x1 → −∞, x2 → ∞ and the solution u3F
can be identiﬁed
with previously known 2F solution. We visualise these ﬁndings diagrammatically in
Fig. 5.

4.2.2 N = 2

The solution and Ω0 reads:

I (x) = 2 log(cid:0)1 + eRe−m1x + e−(m1+m2)x(cid:1) ,
u(2)
1 ≡ u6F
Ω0 = 1 + 2eR(cid:0)1 − m2

+2e−(m1+m2)x(cid:0)1 − (m1 + m2)2(cid:1) + e−2(m1+m2)x .

(4.36)

(4.37)

We have set R2 = −R1 to put the center of mass at the origin and relabel R1 ≡ R
for simplicity.

First, let us verify that the solution u6F

I (x) describes a conﬁguration of two

non-elementary wall located at

˜x1 =

R

,

˜x2 = −

R

.

(4.38)

Contrary to the previous case the mass matrix cannot be ordered in the same way
for all values of the parameters m1 and m2. In fact, there are two possible orderings:

M = − diag(cid:0)0 , m1 , 2m1 , m1 + m2 , 2m1 + m2 , 2m1 + 2m2(cid:1)/2 , m2 > m1 ,
M = − diag(cid:0)0 , m1 , m1 + m2 , 2m1 , 2m1 + m2 , 2m1 + 2m2(cid:1)/2 , m2 ≤ m1 .

The positions of elementary walls in the ﬁrst case reads

The allowed range of the parameters m1 and m2 is a 2-simplex (a rectangular triangle)
deﬁned by the relation m1 + m2 ≤ 1. This means that m1 ≤ 1 and hence x1 ≤ x2.
Thus, ﬁrst two elementary walls form a compressed wall located at their center of
mass ˜x1 = R/m1 as we claimed. Assuming that R > 0 we see that x4 > 0 and
x3 < 0, which means that third and fourth wall are compressed with each other.

Their center of mass is located at −R/m2 + log(cid:0)2 − 2m2
than x5, indicating that ﬁfth wall is compressed as well. Their total center of mass
lies at ˜x2 = −R/m2, in conﬁrmation with Eq. (4.38).

The analysis is completely analogous but now the roles are reversed. The last two
walls are compressed with each other (since x4 < x5) and the ﬁrst three as well
(since for R > 0 we have x3 > 0, x2 < 0 and (m1 + m2)x3 + m2x2 > m1x1). The

center of mass of the triplet is located at ˜x1 = R/m1, while that of the doublet is at
˜x2 = −R/m2, again with full accordance to Eq. (4.38).

It is clear that for higher N the positions of elementary wall will be increasingly
laborious to ascertain due to the ever higher number of possible orderings of the
elements in the mass matrix M. The previous analysis, however, conﬁrmed that
we can be conﬁdent of locations of compressed walls given in Eq. (4.5), which we
extracted directly from the solution (4.1).

Figure 6: Allowed region of mass parameters m1 and m2 for N = 2 case.
In the left
part the edges and vertices are speciﬁed, while in the right we show which solution each
segment represents. The points are formatted as [m1, m2].

On Fig. 6 we show the 2-simplex in two versions.

In ﬁrst, we show relations
among mi’s that deﬁnes its boundary and in the second we put label on each face,
edge and vertex specifying which solution a given region represents. This ﬁgure
summarise where reductions of number of ﬂavors occur. As discussed in the previous
subsection, sources of reduction are twofold. The ﬁrst is where some entries of the
moduli matrix H0 vanishes. There are only three possibilities, which deﬁnes the
boundary of the triangle. The edges m1 = 0 and m2 = 0 returns us to the N = 1
case, therefore we already know the answer there. The last edge of the triangle
m2 = 1 − m1 represents a new 5F solution:
II (x) = 2 log(cid:0)1 + eRe−mx + e−x(cid:1) ,
u5F
(4.51)
Ω0 = 1 + 2eRe−mx(1 − m2) + e2Re−2mx + 2eRe−(1+m)xm(2 − m) + e−2x , (4.52)
where we have relabelled the parameters m1 = m and m2 = 1 − m for simplicity.
This solution can be reduced further by setting m = 1 or m = 0, which leads to the

– 32 –

u2F
I (x) solution.

The second way how to reduce the number of ﬂavors is to make some elements
of the mass matrix M identical. In the present case, there is only one interesting
possibility: m1 = m2 ≡ m. This is the 2-chain, which we encountered in Eq. (3.18):
(4.53)

I (x) = 2 log(cid:0)1 + eRe−mx + e−2mx(cid:1) = u3F
Ω0 = 1 + 2eRe−mx(1 − m2) + e−2mx(cid:0)2 − 8m2 + e2R(cid:1) + 2eRe−3mx(cid:0)1 − m2(cid:1)

II (x + S) + u3F

II (x − S) ,

+ e−4mx ,

(4.54)

u5F

where S = arccosh(R/2)/m. The curious property of this solution is that the param-
eter m can escape the 2-simplex and still give a well-deﬁned solution for arbitrary
separation of walls. But when m ≥ 1/2 it is preferable to redeﬁne parameter R as
(4.55)

eR →pe2R + 8m2 − 2 ,

so that every coeﬃcient in Ω0 is manifestly positive. We can reduce the number of
ﬂavors further by setting m = 1, which produce a known 3F solution u5F
I (m = 1) =
u3F
I

.
There is, however, still one option left. We can also reduce the number of ﬂavors
of u5F
I (x) by ﬁxing the positions of the wall to a speciﬁc values, which will make the
third factor in Eq. (4.54) disappear. In other words, we set R = log(8m2 − 2)/2.
This can be done only for m ∈ [1/2, 1] and the resulting solution is

u4F

II (x) = 2 log(cid:0)1 + √8m2 − 2e−mx + e−2mx(cid:1) ,
Ω0 = 1 + 2e−mx√8m2 − 2(1 − m2) + 2e−3mx√8m2 − 2(cid:0)1 − m2(cid:1) + e−4mx .

(4.56)

(4.57)

In Fig. 6 we have indicated this special solution by a dashed line. Lastly, by setting
m = 1 in u4F
II . With this observation, we have
exhausted all possible reductions in N = 2 case. We summarise the structure of
reductions on Fig. 7.

The allowed region in m-space is a rectangular tetrahedron m1 + m2 + m3 ≤ 1
(see Fig. 8). The boundary of this 3-simplex is where some entries of the moduli
matrix vanishes. The faces that are attached to the origin – rectangular triangles
m1 = 0, m2 = 0 and m3 = 0 – are where we return to the N = 2 case.

Figure 8: The allowed parameter region for N = 3 case is a rectangular tetrahedron. In
the left panel we see the generic solutions attached to each face. Faces where one of the
parameters vanishes corresponds to N = 2 case, while the top face is a new 9F solution. In
the right panel, we ‘unlit’ the top face to reveal inner structure of the tetrahedron, which is
cut by ﬁve planes. These cuts represents mass matrix degeneracies of the general solution.
The points shown on the pictures are formatted as [m1, m2, m3].

The remaining face m3 = 1 − m1 − m2 corresponds to the ﬁrst 9F solution:

We can further lower the number of ﬂavors of this solution by investigation linear
relations among parameters m1 and m2. The full structure of reductions is displayed

And ﬁnally, if we choose special values for m for which all three relations are satisﬁed
we obtain most ﬂavor reduced solutions. These special values are the roots of the
equation (8m2 − 1)2(1 − m2) = 9m2 − 1. It turns out that there are two for which
m ∈ [1/2, 1]. Let us denote these roots as ˜m and ¯m. Their approximate values are
˜m ≈ 0.883 and ¯m ≈ 0.597. If we choose the ﬁrst root we obtain R1 = log(8 ˜m2− 2) ≈

possible reductions in N = 3 case. We summarise the structure of reductions on

5. Conclusions

In this paper we have shown many new exact solutions of the master equation (2.12).
Our main claim is that the class of functions

exhausts all exact solutions of the master equation for domain walls (2.12), which
can be written as a logarithm of sum of exponentials. Of course, since we cannot
prove this statement, we regard it as a conjecture.

In this paper we have studied two subgroups of the class (5.1) in detail. In the
Sec. 3 we have developed a concept of chains, originally spotted in [19]. These are
the solutions, which can be written as sum of single-wall solutions, or links, which
we have denoted as u3F
I (x) and their deﬁnitions can be found in Eq. (3.9)
and Eq. (3.12). We have discussed general properties of arbitrary long chains and
derived general formulas for both the number of ﬂavors of the minimal model in
Eq. (3.40) and the restriction on parameters in Eq. (3.44), which must be satisﬁed
in order to have well-deﬁned moduli matrix.

II (x) and u4F

In Sec. 4 we have given a general discussion of solutions, which corresponds to
taking ˜N = 0 limit in Eq. (5.1). In particular, we have showed that in terms of new
variables v(x) = eu(x) − 1, these solutions can be understood as chains as well. More
importantly, we have pointed out that solutions are related to each other via limits
in their parameter space and thus form hierarchies. We showcased this hierarchy in
detail for solutions up to NF = 10 ﬂavors.

Throughout this paper we argued that our exact solutions have two common

features. First, they are all core-less and second, they are always non-elementary.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the ﬁrst property. The lack of cores is intimately linked
to the restriction on parameters in Eq. (4.30). Indeed, this condition is in place to
ensure that the lowest coeﬃcient in Ω0 is never negative. At most, it can be zero,

– 42 –

at which case remaining coeﬃcients are positive. On the other hand, the core can
develops only when all coeﬃcients in Ω0 are very close to zero, since if Ω0 = 0 the
solution u = g2v2x2 is the unbroken phase inside the core. Given this observation,
it is no surprise that our solutions cannot develop cores. Another, more heuristic
reason, why our solutions are always core-less domain walls is that the functions
we are working with, that is combinations of log(x) and exp(x), seems to be not
suﬃcient to produce the shape of core-ful domain walls, visualised in Fig. 2.

The fact that our solutions are non-elementary walls, is harder to understand.
More precisely, we claim that none of the multi-wall solutions of this paper have
moduli, which could isolate elementary walls. For chains of Sec. 3 this is easy to
see because the single-wall links of which chains are made of u3F
are non-
elementary walls from the beginning. To conﬁrm the same for the broadest class of
solutions in Eq. (5.1) is much harder to do in general. Intuitively, however, given
that the constraint (4.30) makes any generic multi-wall conﬁguration lighter than the
lightest exact elementary wall u2F
, it is natural to conclude that our solutions are
I
all non-elementary. Despite this observation, the very fact that exact description of
elementary walls seems to be much more diﬃcult task than description of compressed
ones, remains very puzzling.

II and u4F
I

In light of these ﬁndings, we are left with two challenges: ﬁrst, is to ﬁnd solutions
for walls with well-developed cores and second, is to understand the disproportion
between the number of exact elementary domain walls – which are three: u2F
, u2F
I
I
and u3F
III – and the number of exact compressed domain walls – which is potentially
unlimited if the number of Higgs ﬁelds NF is arbitrarily large.

In closing, let us brieﬂy comment about the impact of our ﬁndings to other

topological solitons.

The most direct implications can be made for composite solitons containing
domain walls, such as wall-wall junctions and wall-vortex junctions. The reason is
that their master equations includes Eq. (2.12) as a subset, which hints that similar
richness of exact solutions found for domain walls could be found there as well. Our
preliminary results strongly favours this possibility and we plan to explore this fully
in a future study.

Another straightforward implication is that multi-ﬂavor non-Abelian domain
walls (studied in [17]) should possess large number of exact solutions too. This can
be seen easily by acknowledging the fact that solutions in Abelian model can be
embedded into a non-Abelian case. More precisely, for a class of so-called U(1)-
factorizable solutions, the non-Abelian analog of the master equation can be shown
to decompose into a direct sum of independent Abelian master equations. Therefore
any solution presented here can be used to construct a U(1)-factorizable solutions
in a non-Abelian model. The question whether our approach can help to ﬁnd exact
solutions which are not U(1)-factorizable provides another interesting direction for
future work.

– 43 –

Lastly, an indirect implication of our results is that it raises expectations about
number and abundance of exact solutions in any master equation.
In particular,
in the paper [23] F.B. and others found several new exact solutions of semi-local
vortices, hinting a very rich structure of exact solutions there. We plan to elaborate
on these ﬁndings in the future.
