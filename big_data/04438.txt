ABSTRACT

Due to their steep spectra, low-frequency observations of FR II radio galaxies potentially
provide key insights in to the morphology, energetics and spectrum of these powerful radio
sources. However, limitations imposed by the previous generation of radio interferometers at
metre wavelengths has meant that this region of parameter space remains largely unexplored.
In this paper, the ﬁrst in a series examining FR IIs at low frequencies, we use LOFAR observa-
tions between 50 and 160 MHz, along with complementary archival radio and X-ray data, to
explore the properties of two FR II sources, 3C452 and 3C223. We ﬁnd that the morphology
of 3C452 is that of a standard FR II rather than of a double-double radio galaxy as had previ-
ously been suggested, with no remnant emission being observed beyond the active lobes. We
ﬁnd that the low-frequency integrated spectra of both sources are much steeper than expected
based on traditional assumptions and, using synchrotron/inverse-Compton model ﬁtting, show
that the total energy content of the lobes is greater than previous estimates by a factor of
around 5 for 3C452 and 2 for 3C223. We go on to discuss possible causes of these steeper
than expected spectra and provide revised estimates of the internal pressures and magnetic
ﬁeld strengths for the intrinsically steep case. We ﬁnd that the ratio between the equiparti-
tion magnetic ﬁeld strengths and those derived through synchrotron/inverse-Compton model
ﬁtting remains consistent with previous ﬁndings and show that the observed departure from
equipartition may in some cases provide a solution to the spectral versus dynamical age dis-
parity.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Radio galaxies

Radio galaxies can be broadly grouped into two categories: the
centre-brightened Fanaroff & Riley (1974) class I (FR I), and the
edge brightened class II (FR II) galaxies. FR IIs generally con-
sist of three key structures: jets, lobes and hotspots, and are the
more powerful of the two classes with typical 1.4 GHz luminosi-
ties greater than ∼ 1025 W Hz−1 (Owen & Ledlow, 1994). The
largest extent of jets and lobes in established FR IIs are commonly
observed on scales of tens of kiloparsecs (Alexander & Leahy,
1987; Konar et al., 2006; Machalski et al., 2009) to megaparsecs
(Mullin et al., 2006; Machalski et al., 2008) in size and, as these
lobes are in direct contact with their external environment, they are
able to interact with both the intergalactic medium (IGM) and, if
located in clusters, the intracluster medium (ICM). However, many
unanswered questions remain about the underlying dynamics and
energetics of these powerful radio sources.

Radio galaxies are widely believed to play an important role
in the evolution of galaxies and clusters (e.g. Croton et al., 2006;
Bower et al., 2006; Fabian, 2012; McNamara & Nulsen, 2012;
Morganti et al., 2013; Heckman & Best, 2014). Their presumed
ability to suppress star formation in models of galaxy evolution
and to interact with their surrounding environment means that accu-
rately determining the dynamics and energetics of these powerful
outﬂows is vital if we are to understand the impact they have on
how galaxies and clusters evolve over time. This work addresses
important questions regarding the dynamics and energy content of
two nearby, powerful FR II radio galaxies that are representative of
the class. Speciﬁcally, we address the question of whether the lobes
are overpressured relative to the external medium, and expanding
supersonically. This question surrounding the dynamics also has a
strong impact on the predicted scaling relation between jet power
and radio luminosity (Godfrey & Shabala, 2015), a key ingredient
in studies of radio loudness and jet production (Sikora et al., 2007)
as well as quantifying radio mode feedback (Croton et al., 2006).

Limitations imposed by the previous generation of radio in-
terferometers have meant that the brightness distributions of ra-
dio galaxies are currently poorly determined at metre wavelengths.
Such observations are particularly important in the study of steep
spectrum emission which is not detectable at higher frequencies,
and in determining the energy content and distribution of the
lowest energy electrons. With the LOw Frequency ARray (LO-
FAR; van Haarlem et al., 2013) now fully operational, this is set to
change. Consisting of ∼25000 high-band (HBA, 110 - 240 MHz)
and low-band (LBA, 10 - 90 MHz) dipole antennas arranged into
46 stations spread throughout northern and central Europe, LOFAR
is currently the world’s largest connected interferometer, with base-
lines of up to ∼1500 km providing broad bandwidth, high resolu-
tion observations at low frequencies. LOFAR therefore now allows

detailed low frequency spectral and morphological studies of ra-
dio galaxies on resolved spatial scales to be undertaken, and has
already began to produce exciting new results both for well known
active radio galaxies (e.g. 3C31, Heesen et al., in prep) and previ-
ously unknown remnant radio galaxies (e.g. Shulevski et al., 2015;
Brienza et al., 2016). Such investigations are a key step if we are to
accurately determine the impact of powerful radio galaxies on their
environment.

1.2 The energetics and magnetic ﬁeld of FR II radio galaxies

It has long been known that equipartition between the energy
density of the relativistic particles in the lobes of radio galax-
ies and that of the magnetic ﬁeld lies close to the minimum en-
ergy density required for the observed synchrotron-emitting plasma
in radio galaxies (Burbidge, 1956). Assuming that these are the
only two factors contributing to the energy density,
the total
energy content of a source can be determined solely via syn-
chrotron emission at radio wavelengths; however, this has his-
torically led to problems such as apparently underpressured ra-
dio lobes in seemingly expanding sources (e.g. Morganti et al.,
1988; Hardcastle & Worrall, 2000; Worrall & Birkinshaw, 2000;
Harwood et al., 2015). A more robust calculation of the total en-
ergy content of FR II sources can be obtained where high resolution
X-ray data are available. X-ray emission from the lobes of FR IIs
is fairly common (e.g. Tashiro et al., 1998; Hardcastle & Worrall,
2000; Isobe et al., 2002; Hardcastle et al., 2004) and is thought to
be a result of the inverse-Compton process upscattering cosmic mi-
crowave background photons (iC/CMB) (e.g. Kataoka & Stawarz,
2005; Hardcastle & Croston, 2005). As the iC/CMB emissivity
does not depend on the magnetic ﬁeld of the source, modelling of
the combined synchrotron/inverse-Compton spectrum (constrained
by measurements at radio and X-ray energies respectively) can pro-
vide a more robust measure of the magnetic ﬁeld strength (e.g.
Croston et al., 2004, 2005).

One key assumption required for these models is the spectrum
at low frequencies, as the magnetic ﬁeld calculation involves scal-
ing from the synchrotron emitting electrons with γ ∼ 104 to the
inverse-Compton electrons with γ ∼ 103. Whilst integrated ﬂux
densities at these wavelengths have long been available, the limited
number of data points has meant that the spectrum of this emission
must be assumed. As the spectrum of these sources is always rela-
tively steep (α > 0.5)1 any signiﬁcant change in this assumption
can greatly impact on the derived energy content of the source. LO-
FAR observations therefore provide the ability to constrain these
models and evaluate the previously used assumptions about low-
frequency spectrum and magnetic ﬁeld strength.

1.3 Outstanding questions addressed in this paper

2.2 Data reduction

In this paper, the ﬁrst in a series examining FR II radio galaxies at
low frequencies, we use LOFAR observations to explore the mor-
phology, magnetic ﬁeld strength and energetics of two powerful
radio sources. We address three primary questions:

(i) How does the morphology of FR II radio galaxies at LOFAR

frequencies compare to previous studies at higher frequencies?

(ii) What is the magnetic ﬁeld strength of FR II radio galaxies

and does it agree with that derived from equipartition?

(iii) Do improved constraints placed on the low-energy electron
distribution change our understanding of the energetics of FR II
radio galaxies?

In Section 2 we give details of target selection, data reduction
and the analysis undertaken. Section 3 presents our results and in
Section 4 we discuss these ﬁndings in the context of the aims out-
lined above. Throughout this paper, a concordance model in which
H0 = 71 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.27 and ΩΛ = 0.73 is used
(Spergel et al., 2003).

2 DATA REDUCTION AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS

2.1 Target selection and observations

Thirteen targets were observed as part of the surveys Key Sci-
ence Project (KSP), cycle-0 nearby AGN proposal covering various
stages in the life-cycle of radio-loud active galaxies. Of this sam-
ple, two nearby powerful radio galaxies for which complementary
X-ray observations were available, 3C223 and 3C452, were suit-
able for the study of active FR II sources (Table 1). To ensure good
UV coverage and sensitivity, 10 hour observations were made of
each target at HBA and LBA frequencies using the core and re-
mote Dutch stations. At the time of these observations, this pro-
vided baselines out to 100 km which, at the lowest HBA frequency
(110 MHz), give a resolution of ∼7 arcseconds.
Suitable ﬂux calibrators were selected for each target from
a list of reference sources (Scaife & Heald, 2012) which, for
HBA observations, were interlaced with the target observations
at 11 minute intervals. At LBA frequencies, where correcting for
changes in the atmosphere and side lobe effects on short time scales
is extremely important, the calibrator source was observed concur-
rently with the target by using some of the available bandwidth to
form a second beam on the sky which constantly monitors the cal-
ibrator source. A summary of the observational setup is given in
Table 2.

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

The calibration of the data used in this paper follows the guidelines
set out in the standard imaging cookbook2; however, as LOFAR
data reduction is a relatively new process, we summarize here some
of the key procedures and LOFAR speciﬁc functions that have been
written for the handling of these low-frequency data.

One key difference in the dipole setup of LOFAR compared
to observations using parabolic dishes is the need for the removal
of bright radio sources. As LOFAR always sees the entire sky, the
5 brightest radio sources (Cassiopeia A, Cygnus A, Hydra A, Tau-
rus A and Virgo A) must be subtracted from the data if they are
expected to interfere heavily with a given observation. These so-
called A-team sources, the properties of which have been well char-
acterized, are therefore removed in a process known as demixing
prior to the data being made available to the end user. However, if
this demixing is performed when interference from A-team sources
is not present, the data quality can deteriorate. Prior to observation,
simulations were therefore run in order to determine if the demix-
ing of A-team sources was required. We found that at both LBA
and HBA frequencies, Cygnus A and Cassiopeia A heavily affect
the observations, and demixing of these sources was undertaken. To
reduce the datasets to a manageable size, each sub-band was also
averaged down to four, 48.8 kHz channels and to 5 (HBA) and 10
(LBA) second integration times by the LOFAR support staff prior
to the data being made available.

Once complete, the 3C223 and 3C452 data were downloaded
from the archive to the LOFAR cluster at Southampton Uni-
versity and the ASTRON CEP3 cluster respectively. Due to the
high volume of data produced by LOFAR (even after averag-
ing), a complete manual reduction of observations is not desir-
able, and so initial calibration was carried out using the observa-
tory pipeline (Heald et al., 2010). Within this pipeline, ﬂagging of
visibilities affected by radio frequency interference (RFI) was ﬁrst
performed on the demixed and averaged data using the AOFlagger
of Offringa et al. (2010). Amplitude calibration and phase solutions
were then determined from the calibrator sources (Table 2) using
BlackBoard Selfcal (BBS, Pandey et al., 2009), which accounts for
variations of the LOFAR station beams, and the solutions applied.
Models of the ﬁelds of view were then created using the Global
Sky Model (GSM; Scheers, 2011) function which uses the VLA
Low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS), Westerbork Northern Sky
Survey (WENSS) and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) surveys
(Condon et al., 1994, 1998; Rengelink et al., 1997; Cohen et al.,
2007) to determine the source properties. A phase only calibration

was then carried out using BBS, all solutions were transferred to
the target source, the array beam applied, and a further round of
automated ﬂagging performed on the corrected data. Finally, the in-
dividual subbands of the LOFAR observations were concatenated
using the New Default Pre-Processing Pipeline (NDPPP) package
and a manual inspection of the data made. To obtain a reasonable
number of data points across the frequency space, but also maintain
a good signal to noise ratio, the data were concatenated into 4-MHz
bands for 3C452 and 7-MHz bands for 3C223 at HBA frequencies.
At LBA frequencies, both observations were severely affected by
the ionosphere and so were unsuitable for our analysis, with the
exception of a single 12-MHz band for 3C223 centred at 52 MHz.
Any remaining RFI was then ﬂagged manually using CASA in the
standard manner.

In order to further improve the image quality, direction inde-
pendent phase only self-calibration was then performed on each
dataset. CASA was chosen as the preferred imaging and self-
calibration tool in order to utilise the multi-frequency synthe-
sis (MFS) algorithm with two Taylor series terms (nterms = 2;
Rau & Cornwell, 2011), which scales the ﬂux by a spectral index
value ﬁtted over the observed bandwidth, and multi-scale cleaning
which were not yet available to the LOFAR speciﬁc AWImager
(Tasse et al., 2013). This has the advantage of both enhancing the
image ﬁdelity and signiﬁcantly reducing the computing time re-
quired. While this removed the ability to correct for the attenuation
of the LOFAR primary beam, from ﬁgure 21 of van Haarlem et al.
(2013) we see that at 150 MHz the sensitivity at a ﬁeld radius of
30 arcminutes remains >95 per cent of the peak response. The
fact that the sources are located at the centre of the ﬁeld of view
and have a largest angular size of only around 5 arcminutes means
that any losses due to the sensitivity drop off could safely be ig-
nored. Unlike in the high frequency regime, the LOFAR self cal-
ibration strategy involves including only the core LOFAR stations
and iteratively moving outwards to include longer baseline. This is
due to the remote stations (i.e. the longest baselines) not being on
the same clock leading to potential time offsets, and ensures that
phase coherence is maintained. Due primarily to RFI, instrumental
and ionospheric effects (particularly at the edge of the observing
frequency), at HBA wavelengths only 6 of the 7-MHz bands for

3C223 and 10 of the 4-MHz bands for 3C452 between ∼116 and
160 MHz were suitable for ﬁnal imaging.
Once self calibrated, the images were mapped at the resolution
appropriate to the lowest LBA and HBA frequencies with a cell
size one ﬁfth of that value. Although within this paper we are only
interested in the integrated ﬂuxes of the sources, these parameters
ensure that the images are well matched in resolution to allow a
full spectral ageing analysis to be performed in the second paper in
this investigation. A summary of parameters used for the imaging
described in this section is shown in Tables 3 and 4. HBA images
were also created using the full bandwidth centred at a frequency of
147 and 138 MHz for 3C223 and 3C452 respectively. The resulting
HBA and LBA images are shown in Figures 1 and 2.

2.3 Synchrotron/inverse-Compton model ﬁtting

As was discussed in Section 1.2, it is a common assumption that the
relativistic particles in the lobes of radio galaxies and the magnetic
ﬁeld are the only contributing factors in determining the energy
density of the lobes; however, there is no a priori reason to believe
that the total energy content (the sum of the energy density in the
radiating particles, the magnetic ﬁeld, and any non-radiating parti-
cles such as protons) is not signiﬁcantly higher than the minimum
energy condition. This has made estimates of the energy budget
based on radio observations alone highly uncertain.

The availability of X-ray data for our target sources reduces
this problem by allowing a determination of the magnetic ﬁeld
strength to be made free from the assumption of equipartition and
minimum energy. The total losses suffered by particles emitting
at radio wavelengths are a combination of inverse-Compton and
synchrotron losses, which are proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld
strength in the lobes and the equivalent ﬁeld of the CMB such that
CM B. The equivalent ﬁeld of the CMB scales
with redshift as BCM B = 0.318(1 + z)2, hence the energy losses
of the particles due to inverse-Compton scattering at low redshifts
only becomes important at low frequencies.

B = pB 2

lobe + B 2

Conversely, the energy gained by the CMB photons is given

where uCM B is the energy density of the CMB. The X-ray inverse-
Compton emission is therefore dependent on only the supply of
photons that will be up-scattered, in this case the CMB, and the
energy of the scattering particles. Provided that the spectrum of a
source is well known at radio wavelengths (particularly at low fre-
quencies), the 1 keV inverse-Compton X-ray emission can be com-
bined with the magnetic ﬁeld dependent radio synchrotron emis-
sion to give constraints on the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the source.
For FR IIs where the contribution from non-radiating particles
is thought to be negligible (Wardle et al., 1998; Homan & Wardle,
1999; Croston et al., 2005; Konar & Hardcastle, 2013), and with
the magnetic ﬁeld now known, a more robust estimate of the en-
ergy density of the synchrotron-emitting plasma, hence total energy
content of the lobes, can also be made. To investigate the energetics
of our two sources, we therefore reﬁtted the synchrotron/inverse-
Compton models used by Croston et al. 2004 and 2005, constrained
by the new radio observations presented here. In addition to the
LOFAR measurements, ﬂux densities at 330 MHz and 1.4 and 8
GHz were included in the synchrotron/inverse-Compton modelling
which, along with the X-ray ﬂux, were taken to be the values mea-
sured by Croston et al. 2004 and 2005. Archival low-frequency
measurements were also included to extend our frequency cover-
age down to around 10 MHz for 3C452 and 20 MHz for 3C223.
In order to constrain the spectrum of 3C452 at LBA frequencies
we also include the integrated ﬂux value presented by Kassim et al.
(2007) who use the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) at 73.8 MHz
assuming a 5 per cent uncertainty in the ﬂux calibration. A sum-
mary of the archival data used is given in Table 5.

In order to ensure the results are directly comparable to those
of Croston et al. (2005), 3C452 uses the total ﬂux for the model
ﬁtting as its morphology means there is no clear division between
the two lobes. For 3C223, the ﬂux of each lobe was determined for
the unresolved archival data using the ratio between the northern
and southern lobes of 49:51 derived by Croston et al. (2004) who
used the average of the fraction of the total ﬂux in each lobe in the
resolved images at 1.5 and 8 GHz.

The SYNCH code of Hardcastle et al. (1998) was used to ﬁt a
two component model consisting of a synchrotron spectrum con-
strained by low-frequency radio measurements, and an inverse-
Compton spectrum constrained by X-ray observations. We applied
the model presented by Croston et al. (2005) which used an elec-
tron distribution described by a single power law and bounded by
the high and low energy cutoffs given in Table 6. The radio lobes
were modelled as cylinders and we assumed a minimum energy
cutoff where γmin = 10. This value is constant with that used
by Croston et al. (2004, 2005) and was based on observations of
hotspots in FR IIs where γmin ∼ 100 to 1000 (e.g. Carilli et al.,
1991; Hardcastle et al., 1998) which, after adiabatic expansion (e.g.
Godfrey et al., 2009), reduces to a γmin of approximately 10 for the
lobes.

In theory, particles are shock accelerated in the hotspot regions

of FR IIs to a power law energy distribution such that

N (E) = N0E−δ

duced by this power law distribution of shock accelerated particles

(the injection index) is directly related to the δ term by

αinj =

δ − 1

(3)

For steep spectrum sources (δ > 2) where γmax >> γmin, a
change in αinj will have a signiﬁcant impact on the energy stored
at low frequencies scaling as

Ue ∝

γ 2−δ
min
δ − 2

(4)

where Ue is the total energy contained in the relativistic electrons.
For the special case where δ = 2 (αinj = 0.5), the dependence
on γmax/γmin becomes logarithmic and so the impact on the total
energy content is reduced.

The injection index was determined empirically from the best
ﬁtting low-frequency spectral index of the LOFAR images and the
measurements of Croston et al. 2004 and 2005. As losses due to
spectral ageing should be low at these wavelengths (discussed fur-
ther in Section 4.3), this should provide a robust estimate of the
initial power law distribution.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Data quality and integrated ﬂux

Before an analysis of these sources can be undertaken (particularly
in the case of new instruments such as LOFAR) we must ﬁrst con-
sider the reliability of the calibration and any errors associated with
the data. Comparison to previous studies provides a good check of
our ﬂux calibration. Using the integrated ﬂux values and spectral
index for 3C223 presented by Orr´u et al. (2010) who use VLA ob-
servations at 74 and 327 MHz and extrapolating to LOFAR LBA
and HBA frequencies, we ﬁnd total integrated ﬂux values of 37.4
Jy at 51.6 MHz and 17.9 Jy at 161 MHz. As a secondary check,
the same process can be carried out using the integrated ﬂuxes

tabulated by Laing & Peacock (1980) at 84 MHz and 178 MHz.
These give similar values of 36.9 Jy at 51.6 MHz and 17.0 Jy at
161 MHz. Following the same process for 3C452 using the values
of Nandi et al. (2010) at 153 MHz and the spectral index given by
Hardcastle et al. (2004), we ﬁnd that at 152 MHz the integrated ﬂux
is 81.6 Jy. Comparing these values to Table 7, and assuming a cali-
bration error of 10 per cent at HBA and 15 per cent LBA frequen-
cies due to uncertainties in the ﬂux scale and global beam model
(Scaife & Heald, 2012; van Weeren et al., 2014), we ﬁnd our mea-
surements are in good agreement with the literature. We note that
for both sources the HBA in-band spectral index is ﬂatter than one
might expect given the overall spectrum between 50 MHz and 1.4
GHz. Uncertainties associated with the LOFAR HBA beam, par-
ticularly for measurements taken away from the central frequen-
cies, mean that the in-band spectrum is currently still unreliable;
however, the overall spectral index remains well within the stated
calibration errors.

While the thermal noise measured in the images for both
sources at HBA frequencies is relatively low (. 1 mJy beam−1,
Table 7), the noise close to the sources is signiﬁcantly higher by
a factor of around 5−10 times than when measured in a blank re-
gion of the sky. This increased noise is observed in both sources
close to the hotspots and is therefore likely to be an issue related
to dynamic range limitations in these regions. This is particularly
prominent in the northern lobe of 3C223 where the dynamic range
is greatest. For the purposes of our analysis, the increased RMS
close to the source remains fractionally low compared to the inte-
grated ﬂux (.1 per cent at HBA frequencies) and should therefore
not impact signiﬁcantly upon our results.

3.2 Morphology

From Figure 1 we see that both 3C223 and 3C452 have a classi-
cal FR II morphology consisting of edge brightened, diffuse lobe
emission with clear hotspots towards the end of the source. The
morphology of 3C223 closely matches that of previous studies (e.g.
Leahy & Perley, 1991; Orr´u et al., 2010) with previously known
structure at comparable resolutions being successfully recovered.
While for 3C223 the observed morphology is what one would ex-
pect for a classical FR II, 3C452 proves to be a more interesting
case.

It was recently suggested by Sirothia et al. (2013) that 3C452
may be a so-called double-double (DDRG; Schoenmakers et al.,
2000). DDRGs contain two pairs of radio lobes resulting from two
separate episodes of AGN activity: a pair of faint outer lobes from
a previous active phase, and a pair of bright, inner lobes from the
current outburst of activity. Panel A of Figure 3 shows the image

presented by Sirothia et al. (2013), where two pairs of these lobe-
like structures are clearly visible, and the LOFAR image presented
within this paper with a comparable ﬁeld of view. While the active
inner lobes of 3C452 recover the same structure in both images, it
is immediately clear that the outer remnant lobes are not observed
in the LOFAR observations. We discuss the possible causes of this
missing emission in Section 4.1.

3.3 Energy density and magnetic ﬁeld strength

Within errors, the integrated LOFAR ﬂuxes of both sources agree
well with the original observations at other frequencies made by
Croston et al. (2004, 2005); however, the now well constrained
spectrum of the emission at very low frequencies provides some
potentially interesting differences with respect to the total energy
content of the lobes of these sources. The integrated spectrum at
these frequencies is much steeper than previously expected with an
index of 0.85 for 3C452 and 0.71 for 3C223, implying a greater
amount of energy is contained in the low-energy electron popula-
tion than previously thought.

From Figure

the
synchrotron/inverse-Compton model ﬁtting under the assumption
that this steep spectral index is representative of the underlying
initial electron energy distribution (Table 6), one ﬁnds that in order
for the model to match the observed 1 keV inverse-Compton ﬂux,
an energy density of 1.2 × 10−12 J m−3 is required for 3C452
and of 2.8 × 10−13 and 3.2 × 10−13 J m−3 are required for
the northern and southern lobes of 3C223 respectively (Table 8).
Comparing these values to those presented by Croston et al. (2004,
2005) we ﬁnd a change in the total lobe energy density by a factor
of 5.0 for 3C452 and by 2.3 in the northern and 2.0 in the southern
lobes of 3C223, a signiﬁcant increase over previous estimates.

One consideration that should be made when determining
the total energy content of the lobes is the uncertainty associated
with γmin. While this value remains unconstrained, Croston et al.
(2005) show that even if γmin = 1000 in the lobes, the effect on the
total energy content is small, varying by only a factor of ≈ 2 for the
injection index values used here. This is due to the electron energy
spectrum’s normalization increasing to maintain equipartition, so
offsetting the reduction at the lowest energies and remaining con-
sistent within the measurement errors. Therefore while a signiﬁcant
shift in γmin could cause the total energy content of 3C223 to be in
closer agreement with previous estimates due to the injection index
of αinj = 0.5 assumed by Croston et al. (2004) scaling logarith-
mically (Section 2.3) rather than by Equation 4, this is unlikely to
be the case for 3C452 where the difference is much larger.

‘Frequency’ refers to the frequency at which measurements were made
for each ‘Source’. The corresponding ﬂuxes are listed in the ‘Integrated
ﬂux’ column with errors in the measurements shown in the ‘Uncertainty’
column. The ‘Reference’ column gives the origin of each value, de-
noted as follows: (1) Laing & Peacock (1980); (2) Kassim et al. (2007); (3)
Croston et al. (2005); (4) Croston et al. (2004); (5) Leahy & Perley (1991);
(6) Hardcastle et al. (1998).

The magnetic ﬁeld strength is also affected by these revised
estimates of the initial electron energy distribution. Comparing the
results of Table 8 to those of Croston et al. (2004, 2005) we see
an increase in the magnetic ﬁeld strength of ∼60 per cent for
both 3C452 and 3C223. However, as a natural consequence the in-
creased electron energy content at low frequencies also impacts on
the equipartition value, causing it to increase from ∼0.50 to 0.87 nT
in 3C452, and from ∼0.35 to 0.45 nT in 3C223. The values derived
from X-ray constraints therefore remain lower than the equiparti-
tion value as originally shown by Croston et al. (2004, 2005). We
discuss the implications of the steeper than expected low frequency
spectrum and the potential implications of the derived values fur-
ther in Section 4.3.

4 DISCUSSION

The morphology and energetics of powerful radio galaxies play an
important role in our understanding of the life-cycle of radio galax-
ies and the impact they have on their environment. Properties such
as the total lobe energy content and magnetic ﬁeld strength are key
parameters which must be reliably determined if we are to derive
properties such as source ages, lobe pressures and, ultimately, the
total energy output of radio galaxies which can impact on galaxy
evolution as a whole.

In this paper we have presented results which explore the low-
frequency morphology, energetics and integrated spectrum of two
powerful radio galaxies, 3C452 and 3C223, which suggest a dispar-
ity from previous investigations. In the following section we exam-
ine possible causes for our ﬁndings and their implications for our
understanding of the FR II population.

tively and are taken directly from Croston et al. (2004, 2005). ‘Length, Ra-
dius’ are the source dimensions assuming a cylindrical geometry and δ is
the electron energy power law index given by δ = 2αinj + 1 where αinj
is the injection index of the source. Note that for 3C452 we use the total size
of the source, as opposed to the individual lobes, to allow direct comparison
to the results of Croston et al. (2004, 2005).

4.1 Remnant emission in 3C452

Until recently, 3C452 was thought to be a prototypical example of
an FR II type radio galaxy with its strong hotspots and a classi-
cal morphology. This assertion was supported by observations pre-
sented by Nandi et al. (2010) who searched for remnant lobes us-
ing the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT; Swarup et al.,
1991), but found no evidence for episodes of previous AGN ac-
tivity. The discovery by Sirothia et al. (2013) that it may instead
be a DDRG was therefore unexpected, with potentially signiﬁcant
consequences for models of radio galaxies, the uniﬁcation of radio-
loud AGN, and their application in cosmological studies. The steep
spectrum of remnant lobes makes low-frequency observations such
as those used within this paper ideal for the study of such emission.
Assuming a (very) conservative estimate for the spectral index for
the outer lobes of α = 0.5, correcting for the smaller LOFAR beam
size, and extrapolating the 3 sigma contour of Sirothia et al. (2013)
back to 138 MHz, the faintest detected remnant emission should
have a surface brightness of around 6 mJy beam−1. If we assume
the spectral index of 2.3 given by Sirothia et al., this increases to 27
mJy beam−1, with brightest remnant regions being around 48 mJy
beam−1. This is well above the < 1 mJy RMS noise of the LOFAR
images and so should be clearly visible but, as was noted in Section
3.2, this emission is not detected in our observations (Figure 3).

In order to determine the cause of this missing emission,
we reprocessed the 325 MHz GMRT data originally used by
Sirothia et al. (2013) along with an additional observation at 153
MHz available in the GMRT archive under project code 13SPA01
(Table 9). We reduced these archival observations using the SPAM
data reduction package (Intema et al., 2009). After initial ﬂagging
of strong radio frequency interference (RFI) and dead antennas,
ﬂux, bandpass and instrumental phase calibrations were derived
from the single scan on 3C48 (adopting the ﬂux standard as de-
ﬁned in Scaife & Heald, 2012) and subsequently applied to the tar-
get ﬁeld visibilities. Several iterations of self-calibration and wide-
ﬁeld imaging were started off with an initial phase-only gain cali-
bration of the target ﬁeld against a simple local sky model derived
from NVSS, WENSS and VLSS. Each iteration also included ﬂag-
ging of weaker but more abundant RFI. The resulting images were
corrected for primary beam attenuation, small astrometric offsets,
and gain errors due to system temperature differences between ﬂux

calibrator and target ﬁeld. From the resulting images shown in pan-
els C and D of Figure 3 we again see that the putative outer lobes
are not detected at either frequency.

Additional information can also be gained by considering the
integrated ﬂux of the source. Figure 5 shows the integrated spec-
trum of 3C452 between 74 MHz and 1.4 GHz with the GMRT
images presented within this paper and by Sirothia et al. (2013),
alongside LOFAR and archival data. We see that within the errors,
all measurements fall along a power law with the exception of the
inner lobes of Sirothia et al. (2013). This is further reinforced by
the fact that this value can be bought back into agreement when the
ﬂux from both the inner and outer lobes are combined, suggesting
that ﬂux from the inner lobes has at some point during the reduction
process been shifted to form the outer lobes.

Given that the remnant emission should be easily observable
at low frequencies but is not seen in either the LOFAR, GMRT 150
MHz or archival observations (e.g. Kassim et al., 2007, at 74 MHz),
that we are unable to reproduce the additional diffuse structure pre-
sented by Sirothia et al. (2013) in the GMRT 330 MHz map, and
that the integrated ﬂux can be brought back into agreement when
the integrated ﬂux of the inner and outer lobes are combined, we
conclude that the most probable cause of the observed outer lobes
is due to artefacts introduced during the self-calibration and/or the
imaging of the source. We therefore conclude that 3C452 is not a
DDRG, but is a standard FR II as was originally assumed.

4.2 Departure from equipartition

Equipartition between a source’s particle and magnetic ﬁeld energy
densities is a common assumption made in the study of radio galax-
ies in order to provide an estimate of the magnetic ﬁeld strength but,
as was described in Section 3.3, the addition of X-ray observations
allows the value of the magnetic ﬁeld strength to be determined free
from this constraint. While for an intrinsically steep initial elec-
tron energy distribution (discussed further in Section 4.3) the ab-
solute magnetic ﬁeld strength increases by ∼60 per cent compared
to Croston et al. (2004, 2005), its relative strength remains much
lower compared to equipartition irrespective of model, being only
∼50 and ∼75 per cent of the equipartition values for 3C452 and
3C223 respectively.
Deviation from equipartition is observed in similar FR
II sources by Croston et al. (2004, 2005) and in 3C452 by
Shelton et al. (2011), who ﬁnd B ≈ 0.3Beq using inverse-
Compton measurements independent of those of Croston et al.
(2005). Such a difference therefore comes as no surprise, but as
a consequence the age of sources as derived from their spec-
trum are also affected. Spectral ageing, the preferential cooling
of high energy electrons due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton
losses (Kardashev, 1962; Pacholczyk, 1970; Jaffe & Perola, 1973;
Tribble, 1993), has long been used as a method of determining
the age of radio galaxies and is a practice which continues to
this day (e.g. Carilli et al., 1991; Jamrozy et al., 2005; Orr´u et al.,

‘Frequency’ refers to the frequency of the map, ‘Off-source RMS’ refers to
RMS noise measured over a large region well away from the source. ‘In-
tegrated ﬂux’ values are listed at each frequency for the two lobes where
‘Lobe 1’ refers to the northern and eastern and ‘Lobe 2’ to the southern and
western lobes of 3C223 and 3C452 respectively.

2010; Heesen et al., 2014; Brienza et al., 2016), but there is of-
ten a large discrepancy between the ages determined in this way
and those determined from a dynamical view point (Eilek, 1996;
Harwood et al., 2013, 2015). In many cases, a simple solution to
this problem is a weaker magnetic ﬁeld strength, leading to lower
radiative losses and older spectral ages. For example, in the case of
3C438 a magnetic ﬁeld strength of only B ≈ 0.5Beq is required
to bring the spectral age back into agreement with the dynami-
cal age. However, in order to determine whether these departures
from equipartition are able to provide the magnetic ﬁeld strength
required to bring the two ages into agreement for the population as
a whole, a detailed ageing study of a large sample of radio galaxies
where both X-ray and radio observations are available is required.
It is of course not feasible to use X-ray observations for all
sources studied but, while the absolute magnetic ﬁeld strength for
both 3C452 and 3C223 is plausibly greater than previously esti-
mated, the increased total energy density of the lobes also changes
the equipartition value as a natural consequence of the assumed re-
lationship between the two values. Consequently, the ratio between
the equipartition value and that found from synchrotron/inverse-
Compton model ﬁtting for both 3C452 and 3C223 remains roughly
constant, varying on the order of only 10 per cent. The results of
Croston et al. (2005), who ﬁnd a strong peak around a value of
0.7Beq, are therefore likely to be robust and provide a better es-
timate of the magnetic ﬁeld strength in FR IIs than equipartition
alone. Future studies using low-frequency radio surveys and the in-
creased availability of archival X-ray observations will further re-
ﬁne this value, but these weaker ﬁeld strengths may go at least part
way to resolving the outstanding problem of explaining the spec-
trum of powerful radio galaxies. We suggest that such deviations
should be carefully considered in future studies of FR IIs in order
to provide a more accurate estimate of a source’s age.

As the loss time scale, τ , of an electron radiating via the syn-
chrotron process scale as

τ =

E

dE/dt ∝ 1/E ∝ 1/ν 2

(5)

it is commonly assumed that for all but the oldest sources (i.e.
those on the order of a few 100 Myr or more), the low frequency
spectrum of radio galaxy lobes maintain their original power law
form, providing a proxy for the initial electron energy distribution.
Previous studies of 3C452 and 3C223 (e.g. Nandi et al., 2010 for
3C452; Orr´u et al., 2010 for 3C223) suggest that both sources fall
well within the required age range for this assumption to be valid;
however, the ﬂux measurements presented in Section 3.3 show that
the integrated spectrum at low frequencies is much steeper than the
traditionally assumed injection index value of αinj ≈ 0.5 (δ ≈
2.0)3.
One possible cause of this observed steeper than expected in-
jection index is that the measured spectrum at LOFAR frequencies
is not representative of the underlying electron energy distribution.
This is expected if the source undergoes time dependent adiabatic
and radiative losses throughout its life (e.g. Murgia et al., 1999)
and is supported by simulations of FR II radio galaxies that sug-
gest the integrated spectrum at these frequencies may be driven to
steeper values due to changes in the magnetic ﬁeld strength, mix-
ing of electron populations, and the environment as a function of
time (Kapinska et al., 2015). Under such conditions, the spectrum
would not provide a good proxy for the initial electron distribution
and typical models of spectral ageing which are applied to the inte-
grated ﬂux (e.g. CI models, Pacholczyk, 1970) would not provide
an accurate description of the particle energy spectrum leading to
an unreliable measure of a source’s intrinsic age. Indeed, the fact
that for 3C223 the X-ray spectral index (constrained by the bow ties
of Figure 4) appears ﬂatter than the radio spectral index indicates
that the electron energy distribution ﬂattens towards lower ener-
gies. The X-ray photons are produced by electrons/positrons with
γ ∼ 1000, a factor of & 2 less than those responsible for the radio
emission in the LOFAR HBA band, and comparable to those radiat-
ing in the LBA band, assuming a magnetic ﬁeld strength ∼ 0.5 nT.

3 It is interesting to note that these values also agree with the average low-
frequency (178 - 750 MHz) integrated spectral index of the 3CRR sample
(Laing et al., 1983) and those of Nandi et al. (2010) who ﬁnd an injection
index of 0.78 for 3C452. There is also some evidence that the jets of FR
Is are slightly (but signiﬁcantly) steeper then the expected αinj = 0.5
(Young et al., 2005; Laing & Bridle, 2013).

with 1 sigma errors on the ﬁtted inverse-Compton model (blue dotted line).
The green dash-dot line shows the expected location of the X-ray in the case
of synchrotron self-Compton.

An alternative explanation is that a break in the spectrum oc-
curs at a much lower frequencies than is classically expected for an
FR II radio galaxy. If this is the case, the spectrum may eventually
ﬂatten to injection index values closer to the expected value of 0.5
and the total energy content of the lobes will be in better agreement
with those derived by Croston et al. (2004, 2005). The low fre-
quency archival observations used in the model ﬁtting suggest that
the integrated spectrum of both 3C452 and 3C223 remains steep
down to ≈20 MHz, although the uncertainty on these measure-
ments does allow for some moderate curvature to be present. Ob-
servations at the very lowest frequencies (≈10 MHz; Braude et al.,
1970; Laing & Peacock, 1980), are limited by their large errors bars
(≈ 25 percent) and so it is not possible to conclusively determine
whether a break at very low frequencies is present in the spectrum.
MHD modelling suggests that producing integrated spectra with
such a low-frequency break is possible (Hardcastle et al., in prepa-
ration), but requires a spectrum not typically described by models
of spectral ageing and there is no easy physical interpretation as to
why such a break would occur.

The most intuitive physical explanation for the steep low-
frequency electron energy distribution observed in both 3C452
and 3C223 is a weaker than expected shock due to a slow mov-
ing jet, as may plausibly be the case for less powerful objects
such as 3C438 (Harwood et al., 2015). Theres has been some
suggestion of a correlation between jet power and injection in-
dex (Konar & Hardcastle, 2013) with weaker shocks resulting in
a steeper initial electron energy distribution; however, the strong,
bright, compact hotspots observed in both 3C452 and 3C223 mean
that this is unlikely to be the case. It is therefore more plausible
that the emission results from a fast jet. It is theoretically possible
to produce a high injection index under certain conditions through
models such as those presented by Konar & Hardcastle (2013), al-
though further investigation is required to determine if this is in-
trinsically the case.

Support in favour of an intrinsically steep injection index also
comes from the spatially resolved spectra of FR II radio lobes.
Harwood et al. (2013, 2015), who consider the spectrum of 4 other
FR II radio galaxies on smaller spatial scales, ﬁnd that in all cases
the injection index is also steeper than previously assumed. These
studies attempt to account for low-frequency curvature when deter-
mining the injection index (hence electron energy distribution) of
a source and, due to being well resolved, should be relatively un-
affected by the superposition of spectra due to limited resolution.
Injection index values found in this way agree well with the low-
frequency spectral indices presented in this paper and have proved
robust against simulations (e.g. Stroe et al., 2014). We note that
preliminary tests (which will form part of paper II of this series)
also ﬁnd a similar distribution using the methods of Harwood et al.
(2013, 2015) implemented in the BRATS4 software package; how-
ever, a similar assumption is made that the injection index is con-
stant over the lifetime of the source. As simulations of FR IIs are
currently unable to trace the spatial evolution and mixing of the un-
derlying electron population, it is not yet clear on what scales such
variations exist and to what extent this impacts upon the determi-
nation of injection index values determined in this way, but further
developments should make this possible over the next few years.

A physically plausible argument can therefore be made for an
intrinsically steep injection index which, if correct, would have a
signiﬁcant impact on our understanding of the energetics of FR II

the lobe listed in the ‘Lobe’ column. ‘Pext’ is the external pressure taken

galaxies. Assuming no signiﬁcant ﬂattening of the spectrum at fre-
quencies .20 MHz, we can infer that a greater electron population
is present at very low energies than previously assumed, resulting
in the total energy content of the lobes increasing by a factor of be-
tween 2 and 5 compared to previous ﬁndings (Table 8). Using the
standard equation for a relativistic plasma, Plobe = U/3, where
Plobe is the lobe pressure and U is the total energy density, we see
a signiﬁcant change in the estimated internal pressure of the lobes
(Table 10). Comparing these values to the external pressures at the
tip of the lobes derived by Shelton et al. (2011) of 1.1±0.1×10−13
Pa for 3C452 and by Croston et al. (2004) of 9.6 ±38.3
8.8 ×10−14 Pa
for 3C223, we see that they are overpressured by a factor of about
4 for 3C452, with the lobes of 3C223 being approximately in pres-
sure balance with the external medium.

For these revised values, our results for 3C452 broadly agree
with those of Shelton et al. (2011) who also ﬁnd that the lobes are
overpressured; however, our revised estimate of the total energy
content increases the internal overpressure by a factor of 2 com-
pared to their ﬁndings. Using the standard equation relating the
Mach number of the shock, M, to the internal to external pressure
ratio (Longair, 2011) and rearranging in terms M we ﬁnd

M = p2((γsh + 1)Pext + (γsh − 1)Pint)

2√γsh√Pint

(6)

where Pext and Pint are the external and internal pressures and,
for a monatomic gas, γsh = 5/3 is the ratio of speciﬁc heats. This
gives a Mach number of M = 1.8 implying the lobes are expend-
ing supersonically and driving a shock as the lobes push through
the external medium. Although such a relatively weak shock is un-
likely to be observable with current X-ray instruments, a tempera-
ture increase is observed in the external medium just beyond the tip
of the lobes (region 3 of Shelton et al., 2011). We can therefore be
fairly conﬁdent that the lobes are both intrinsically overpressured,
and expanding through the external medium supersonically.

For 3C223, our results once again agree within errors to those
of Croston et al. (2004) with the tip of the lobe being at minimum in
pressure balance with the external medium. While the results pre-
sented in this paper suggest that the internal pressure of the lobes
may be signiﬁcantly higher than those derived by Croston et al.
(2004), the large uncertainty on the X-ray measurements from
which the external pressure is derived means that both the overpres-
sured and pressure balance cases are plausible. If one is to obtain
the ratio of internal to external pressures to a higher degree of ac-
curacy (e.g. to test the case of overpressured lobes) then improved
X-ray measurements are required. While we cannot therefore rule
out either case, this pressure increase supports the interpretation of
Croston et al. (2004) that the source does, at minimum, have the
required internal pressure to support the observed lobes. This is in
line with other recent investigations in to the pressure balance of

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

FR IIs (Ineson et al., in prep) which suggest that, while some ex-
ceptions are observed (e.g. 3C444, Croston et al., 2011), the FR II
population as a whole is at minimum in pressure balance with the
external medium when the magnetic ﬁeld strength is derived from
synchrotron/inverse-Compton model ﬁtting.

From the results presented in this paper, it is clear that a re-
vision in our understanding of radio galaxy lobes at LOFAR fre-
quencies is required. Either the low-energy electron population is
much greater than previously assumed, or new models describing
the emission from the lobes of radio galaxies are required if we are
to accurately determine the dynamics and energetics of FR-II radio
galaxies.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented a low-frequency study of two FR
II sources, 3C452 and 3C223. Using LOFAR and complementary
archival observations we have explored the morphology of these
sources and, by constraining the integrated spectrum between ∼10
and 8000 MHz, have investigated their energetics. We have used
synchrotron/inverse-Compton ﬁtting to test 2 possible models of
the low energy electron population and, for the case of an intrinsi-
cally steep injection index, provided revised estimates of the mag-
netic ﬁeld strength, total energy content and pressure of the radio
lobes. We went on to discuss the impact of these ﬁndings on the
pressure balance with the external medium. The key points made
within this paper are as follows:

(i) The morphology of 3C452 is that of a standard FR II type
radio galaxy, contrary to the DDRG classiﬁcation of Sirothia et al.
(2013).

(ii) In order to ﬁt

the low-frequency spectrum, either the
injection index must be steeper than previously assumed or a break
must be present at very low frequencies.

(iii) For an intrinsically steep initial electron energy distribu-
tion, we provide revised total energy content estimates which are
between a factor of 2 and 5 greater than previous ﬁndings.

(iv) For these revised values, we ﬁnd that the magnetic ﬁeld
strength of both sources is greater by around 60 per cent compared
previous estimates, with values of 0.45 nT for 3C452 and 0.36 and
0.32 nT for the northern and southern lobes of 3C223 respectively.

(v) The ratio between equipartition ﬁelds and those derived
through synchrotron/inverse-Compton model ﬁtting remains
consistent with previous ﬁndings at 0.50 and 0.75 for 3C452 and

(vi) We suggest that the observed departure from equipartition
may, in some cases, provide a solution to the spectral versus
dynamical age disparity problem.

We therefore conclude that the morphology of both 3C452 and
3C223 are that of classical FR II galaxies, but with an integrated
low-frequency spectrum steeper than has previously been assumed.
We will further investigate these ﬁndings and the spectrum of these
sources on resolved spatial scales in the second paper in this series.
