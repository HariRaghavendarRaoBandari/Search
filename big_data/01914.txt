A SUPERCONVERGENT HDG METHOD FOR THE MAXWELL EQUATIONS

HUANGXIN CHEN, WEIFENG QIU, AND KE SHI

Abstract. We present and analyze a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for the
Maxwell equations on general polyhedral meshes. The divergence-free condition is imposed on the electric
ﬁeld u, then a Lagrange multiplier p is introduced, and the problem becomes the solution of a mixed curl-
curl formulation of the Maxwell’s problem. For arbitrary polyhedral elements, we use polynomials of degree
k + 1, k, k to approximate u, ∇ × u and p respectively. In contrast, we only use a subspace of polynomials
of degree k + 1 to approximate the numerical trace of the electric ﬁeld and polynomials of degree k + 1
to approximate the numerical trace of the Lagrange multiplier on the faces. The HDG system is shown
to be well-posed and the convergence of the HDG method is derived. Moreover, by exploiting the duality
argument, an optimal L2-error estimate of the electric ﬁeld is obtained. From the point of view of degrees
of freedom of the globally coupled unknown: numerical trace, this HDG method achieves superconvergence
for the electric ﬁeld without postprocessing. Finally, we show that on simplex meshes, by a special choice of
the stabilization parameters, the approximation for the primary unknown u is globally divergence free and
the errors for u, ∇ × u are independent of the Lagrange multiplier p.

In this paper, we consider the Maxwell equations of the following form:

1. Introduction

(1.1a)

(1.1b)

(1.1c)

(1.1d)

∇ × (∇ × u) + ∇p = f

∇ · u = 0

u × n = g

p = 0

in Ω,

in Ω,

on ∂Ω,

on ∂Ω,

where Ω is a simply connected polyhedral domain in R3 and the unknowns are u and p. Here f is the source
term and g is given on ∂Ω. The above Maxwell’s problem follows from ﬁnding an approximation of the
following problem within a three dimensional domain:

∇ × (∇ × u) = f, ∇ · u = 0, u × n|∂Ω = g.

In order to have a better control on the divergence of the electric ﬁeld u, a Lagrange multiplier p is intro-
duced (cf.
[2, 3, 14]), and we consider a generalized mixed formulation (1.1). The Lagrange multiplier p
accommodates the possible non-zero divergence of the source term f. Obviously, p = 0 if f is divergence free.
Various numerical methods have been studied to solve the Maxwell’s problem in the literature which
include H(curl, Ω)-conforming edge element methods [15, 16, 8, 13, 23], discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods
[18, 19, 5, 10, 11, 4, 17, 9, 7], interior penalty method with C0 ﬁnite element [3] and weak Galerkin FEM
method [14]. The DG methods have several attractive features which include the capabilities to handle
complex geometries, to provide high-order accurate solutions, etc. For instance, the mixed DG formulation
for the problem (1.1) was proposed and analyzed. However, the dimension of the standard approximation DG
space is much larger than the dimension of the corresponding conforming space. Hybridizable discontinuous
Galerkin (HDG) methods [6] were recently introduced to address this issue. The HDG methods retain the
advantages of standard DG methods, and the resulting system is only due to the unknowns on the skeleton
of the mesh. The HDG methods were introduced in [17] for the numerical solution of the time-harmonic
Maxwell problem. Compared to the IPDG method for the Maxwell equations in [10, 11, 7], the HDG methods
have less globally coupled unknowns.

In order to apply HDG method, as usual, we ﬁrst write the Maxwell equations (1.1) into a system of ﬁrst
order equations. To this end, we introduce a new unknown w = ∇ × u. Now we can write the Maxwell
equations (1.1) in a mixed curl-curl formulation as follows:

(1.2a)

(1.2b)

(1.2c)

(1.2d)

(1.2e)

∇ × u = w

∇ × w + ∇p = f

∇ · u = 0

u × n = g

p = 0

in Ω,

in Ω,

in Ω,

on ∂Ω,

on ∂Ω.

The objective of this paper is to develop a new HDG method which is absolutely well-posed for the above
mixed curl-curl formulation (1.2). By an appropriate choice of numerical trace of the electric ﬁeld on the
faces, we prove the well-posedness of the HDG system and analyze its convergence property. The enhanced
space for the primary variable of numerical trace was ﬁrst introduced in [12] for diﬀusion problem which
numerically showed that the methods provide optimal order of convergence for all unknowns. Recently, the
authors in [20, 21, 22] applied this approach for linear elasticity problems, convection-diﬀusion problems
and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and gave the rigorous analysis. In this paper, we extend this
approach to the Maxwell equations. We notice that the curl operator contains a non-trivial kernel space,
which will be considered in designing the enhanced space for numerical trace of electric ﬁeld on faces. The
polynomials of degree k + 1, k, k (k ≥ 0) are used to approximate u, ∇ × u and p respectively. An enhanced
subspace of polynomials of degree k + 1 is used to approximate the numerical trace of the electric ﬁeld on
the faces and polynomials of degree k + 1 are used to approximate the numerical trace of the Lagrange
multiplier on the faces. We prove optimal convergence for the discrete H(curl)-norm error and discrete
H(div)-norm error in electric ﬁeld u, and the L2-norm error in w. The duality argument is applied to derive
the optimal convergence for the L2-norm error in the electric ﬁeld. From the point of view of global degrees
of freedom, this HDG method provides optimal convergent approximations to the electric ﬁeld and achieves
superconvergence for the electric ﬁeld without postprocessing. Finally, let us point out that in the case of
simplex meshes, by taking a special choice of the stablization parameters as well as a modiﬁed projection
operator, we can obtain globally divergence free approximation for u while maintaining all the existing
optimal approximation properties and the errors for u and w are independent of the Lagrange multiplier p.
The rest of paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our HDG method for the problem
(1.2) and illustrate the well-posedness of the HDG system. In Section 3, we present the adjoint problem and
give the main a priori error estimates. The detailed proof of the main results is provided in Section 4. In
Section 5, we present the special case on simplex meshes which provides better approximation properties.

2. Preliminaries and the HDG method

To deﬁne the HDG method, we consider conforming triangulation Th of Ω made of shape-regular polyhedral
elements which can be non-convex. We denote by Eh the set of all faces F of all elements K ∈ Th and set
∂Th := {∂K : K ∈ Th}. For scalar-valued functions φ and ψ, we write

(φ, ψ)Th := X

K∈Th

(φ, ψ)K , hφ, ψi∂Th := X

K∈Th

hφ, ψi∂K .

Here (·, ·)D denotes the integral over the domain D ⊂ Rd, and h·, ·iD denotes the integral over D ⊂ Rd−1.
For vector-valued and matrix-valued functions, a similar notation is taken. For example, for vector-valued
i=1(φi, ψi)Th . Finally, for a vector-valued function φ, on any interface
F ∈ Eh we use φn, φt to denote the normal and tangential components of φ respectively. Throughout the
paper we use the standard notations and deﬁnitions for Sobolev spaces (see, e.g., Adams [1]).

functions, we write (φ, ψ)Th := Pn

Like all other HDG schemes, to deﬁne the HDG method for the problem, we need to introduce some new
unknowns called numerical traces on the skeleton of the mesh, Eh. In the case of Maxwell’s equations (1.2), we
need to impose two numerical traces into our HDG formulation. Namely, our HDG method seeks an approx-
h to the exact solution (w|Th , u|Th, p|Th, ut|Eh , p|Eh)

The stabilization parameters τt, τn are deﬁned on each F ∈ ∂Th. For the sake of simplicity, we assume

that τt, τn are two non-negative constants which will be determined later from the analysis.

To end this section, we present the well-posedness result of the above scheme which can be summarized

as follows:

Lemma 2.1. If the stabilization parameters τt, τn are positive everywhere, for k ≥ 0, the HDG system (2.1)
is well-posed.

Proof. Since (2.1) is a linear square system, it suﬃces to show that if all the given data vanish, i.e. f = g = 0,

then we will get zero solution for all unknowns. By taking (r, v, q, η, ζ) = (wh, uh, ph,but

(2.1a)-(2.1e) and adding these equations, after some algebraic manipulation, we can obtain:

h,bph) in the equations

Now by applying the deﬁnition of the numerical ﬂux (2.1f) and (2.1g), we have:

(wh, wh)Th − huh · n −bun

h · n , ph − bphi∂Th + hbut
(wh, wh)Th + hτn(ph − bph) , ph − bphi∂Th + hτt(PMut

h × ni∂Th = 0.

hτt(PMut

h × n − but

h × n), uh × n − but

h × ni∂Th = hτt(PMut

Since we assume that τt, τn are strictly positive on ∂Th, the above two identities imply that

By these results together with (2.1f) we have

wh = 0

and ph − bph = 0, PMut

h − but

h = 0 on ∂Th.

Next we rewrite (2.1a) by integrating by parts on the second term to have:

bwh = 0.

If we take r = ∇ × uh, by the above result and the orthogonal property of L2-projection PM, we have:

(wh, r)Th − (∇ × uh, r)Th − h(uh − but

h) × n , ri∂Th = 0.

∇ × uh = 0.

4

HUANGXIN CHEN, WEIFENG QIU, AND KE SHI

Since wh = 0, bwh = 0, now (2.1b) can be written as (given f = 0):

(2.3)

− (ph, ∇ · v)Th + hbph, v · ni∂Th = 0.

Taking v = ∇ph and integrating by parts for the above equation and the fact that ph − bph = 0 on ∂Th, we

can obtain:

∇ph = 0

on each K ∈ Th.

This implies that ph is piecewise constant on Th. By the fact that ph = bph on Eh, we conclude that ph = 0
on Ω, and hence bph = 0. So far, we have shown that wh, ph,bph vanish.

Finally, taking q = ∇ · uh in (2.1c) and integrating by parts, we have

Since that

we have

(∇ · uh, ∇ · uh)Th − huh · n −buh · n , ∇ · uhi∂Th = 0.

uh · n − buh · n = −τn(ph − bph) = 0 on ∂Th,

∇ · uh = 0

on each K ∈ Th.

To conclude, recall that ∇ × uh = 0 and uh ∈ Pk+1(K) on each K ∈ Th, this means that there exists a

piecewise polynomial φh ∈ Pk+2(K) for each K ∈ Th such that

uh = ∇φh

on each K ∈ Th.

The above fact together with the deﬁnition of the space Mt

h implies that

PM(ut

h) = PM(n × ∇φh × n) = (∇φh)t = ut
h,

since on each interface F ∈ Eh we have (n × ∇φh × n)|F ∈ [∇Pk+2(F )]t ⊂ Mt(F ). This implies that

which, together with the facts that

and both but

h,bun

h · n are single values on Eh, implies that uh ∈ H(curl, Ω) ∩ H(div, Ω) satisfying:

on ∂Th,

h · n on ∂Th,

h

ut

h = but
uh · n = bun

∇ × uh = 0
∇ · uh = 0
uh × n = 0

in Ω,
in Ω,

on ∂Ω.

This yields uh = 0 by the assumption of the domain Ω (cf.
This completes the proof.

[13]). Therefore, we also have but

h = 0 on ∂Th.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.2. In the case of simplex meshes, the condition for τn can be relaxed to τn ≥ 0. Although the
proof for the well possedness needs to be modiﬁed, see Section 5. In this case if we take τn = 0, (2.1g)
becomes

together with (2.1e), we have that uh ∈ H(div, Ω). In addition, if we apply integrating by parts on (2.1c)
and take q = ∇ · uh, we can conclude that

h · n = uh · n on ∂Th,

bun

(2.4)

∇ · uh = 0.

In addition to this globally divergence free property, it can be shown that the error estimates are independent
of the pseudo variable p. More details will be discussed in Section 5.

3. Main results

In this section we present our main error estimates results. To state our main result, we need to introduce
some notations. We use k · ks,D, | · |s,D to denote the usual norm and semi-norm on the Sobolev space
H s(D). We discard the ﬁrst index s if s = 0. The norm k · ks,Th is the discrete norm deﬁned as k · ks,Th :=

PK∈Th k · ks,K. We also deﬁne the discrete norm k · k∂Th := PF ∈∂Th k · kF . To derive an L2 error estimate of

ku − uhkΩ, we need a regularity assumption of an adjoint problem stated as follows: Find (φ, θ, σ) satisfying

(3.1a)

(3.1b)

(3.1c)

(3.1d)

(3.1e)

∇ × φ = θ

∇ × θ − ∇σ = eu
∇ · φ = 0

φ × n = 0

σ = 0

in Ω,

in Ω,

in Ω,

on ∂Ω,

on ∂Ω.

We assume the following regularity estimate holds for the solution of the above adjoint problem (cf. [2, 3, 14]):

(3.2)

kφk1+α,Ω + kθkα,Ω + kσkα,Ω ≤ CregkeukΩ,

where 0 < α ≤ 1.

We are now ready to state our main result.

Theorem 3.1. If the exact solution of (1.2) satisﬁes (u, w, p) ∈ [H t(Ω)]3 × [H s(Ω)]3 × [H 1
1 ≤ s ≤ k + 1, 1 ≤ r ≤ k + 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ k + 2. Taking the stabilization parameters as τt = O( 1
we have

0 (Ω) ∩ H r(Ω)] with
h ), τn = O(h),

kw − whkΩ + k∇ · (u − uh)kTh + k∇ × (u − uh)kTh ≤ C(cid:16)ht−1kukt,Ω + hrkpkr,Ω + hskwks,Ω(cid:17).

In addition, if the regularity (3.2) holds for the adjoint problem, then we have

ku − uhkΩ ≤ C(cid:16)ht+α−1kukt,Ω + hr+αkpkr,Ω + hs+αkwks,Ω(cid:17),

where 0 < α ≤ 1 is deﬁned in (3.2).

Remark 3.2. When the exact solution (u, w, p) of (1.2) is smooth enough, that is, (u, w, p) ∈ [H k+2(Ω)]3 ×
[H k+1(Ω)]3 × [H 1
0 (Ω) ∩ H k+1(Ω)], one can directly derive ku − uhkΩ ≤ Chk+1+α. In particular, if α = 1, we
have ku − uhkΩ ≤ Chk+2. In the global degrees of freedom viewpoint, this error estimates reveals that the
new HDG method achieves superconvergence for the electric ﬁeld without postprocessing.

We begin by introducing the error equations that we need for the error estimates. We deﬁne the projection

of the errors as below:

4. Proofs of the error estimates

eu := ΠV u − uh,

ep := ΠQp − ph,

Here all the projections ΠW , ΠV , ΠQ, PM , PM are the standard L2-projections on the ﬁnite dimensional
h, Mh respectively. In the analysis, we will use the following standard approximation

We are now ready to present the error equations that we need for the error estimates.

Lemma 4.1. Let (w, u, p) and (wh, uh, ph,but

h,bph) solve the equations (1.1) and (2.1), we have

(ew, r)Th − (eu, ∇ × r)Th + hebut × n , ri∂Th = 0,

(4.2a)

(4.2b)

(4.2c)

(4.2d)

(4.2e)

(ew, ∇ × v)Th − (ep, ∇ · v)Th + hw − bwh, v × ni∂Th + he bp, v · ni∂Th = 0,

h · n , ζi∂Th = 0,

for all (r, v, q, η, ζ) ∈ Wh × Vh × Qh × Mt,0

Proof. It is obvious that the exact solution (w, u, p, ut|Eh, p|Eh) also satisﬁes the system (2.1):

(w, r)Th − (u, ∇ × r)Th + hut × n , ri∂Th = 0,

(w, ∇ × v)Th − (p, ∇ · v)Th + hw, v × ni∂Th + hp, v · ni∂Th = (f, v)Th ,

−(u, ∇q)Th + hun · n , qi∂Th = 0,
hw × n , ηi∂Th = 0,
hun · n , ζi∂Th = 0,

for all (r, v, q, η, ζ) ∈ Wh × Vh × Qh × Mt,0
inclusion properties between the ﬁnite dimensional spaces, we can write the above system as:

h. By the orthogonality of the projections as well as the

hun · n , ζi∂Th = 0,

for all (r, v, q, η, ζ) ∈ Wh × Vh × Qh × Mt,0
(2.1) from the above equations.

h. Finally we obtain the error equations by substracting
(cid:3)

We ﬁrst present the estimate for ew which can be achieved by several steps. First we carry out an

important identity by a standard energy argument.

Proof. Taking (r, v, q, η, ζ) = (ew, eu, ep, ebut , e bp) in the error equations (4.2a)-(4.2e) and adding, after some
algebraic manipulations, we obtain:

Notice that by the deﬁnition of the numerical traces (2.1f) and (2.1g) we can write

h · n − eu · n , ep − e bpi∂Th = 0.

w − bwh − ew = w − bwh − (ΠW w − wh) = w − ΠW w + (wh − bwh)

Inserting the above two expressions into (4.3) together with the orthogonal property of the L2-projection
PM we complete the proof.
(cid:3)

Based on the identity in the above lemma, we are ready to estimate ew.

Lemma 4.3. If the regularity of the exact solution (u, w, p) of (1.2) holds as assumed in Theorem 3.1, the
stabilization parameters τt = O( 1

for any η ∈ Pk+2(Th) := ⊕K∈ThPk+2(K). Due to the orthogonal property of PM and the deﬁnition of the

T12 ≤ kw × n − PM(w × n)k∂Thket

u + (∇η)tk∂Th

for any η ∈ Pk+2(Th). We notice that on each K ∈ Th, the ∇× operator is an injective mapping from
Pk+1(K) \ ∇(Pk+2(K)) onto Pk(K), therefore, the two norms:

min

kv + ∇ηkK ,

k∇ × vkK

are equivalent in the ﬁnite dimensional space Pk+1(K). A simple scaling argument implies that

(4.4)

Owing to the above inequality and (4.1d) we have

for 1 ≤ s ≤ k + 1.

To conclude the estimate for kewkΩ, we need to bound k∇ × eukTh. To this end, taking r = ∇ × eu in

the error equation (4.2a) and integrating by parts, we have

(ew, ∇ × eu)Th − k∇ × euk2

Th − h(eu − ebut ) × n , ∇ × eui∂Th = 0.

By the fact that n × (∇ × eu)|F ∈ Mt(F ) for all F ∈ ∂Th, we can rewrite the above identity as

k∇ × euk2

Th = (ew, ∇ × eu)Th − h(PMet

u − ebut ) × n , ∇ × eui∂Th

If we combine the estimates for T1-T4 and apply Young’s inequality, we have

for 1 ≤ r ≤ k + 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ k + 2. The last step is obtained by inverse inequality, triangle inequality and
(4.1b), (4.1f), (4.1g). From all the above estimates, we can see that if we take τt = O( 1
h ), τn = O(h), we
obtain the estimate stated in the lemma.
(cid:3)

Next we apply a duality argument to show the superconvergence of keukΩ. We ﬁrst present the following

identity that we are going to use in the analysis.

Lemma 4.4. Let (φ, θ, σ) be the solution of the adjoint problem (3.1), then we have

:=T1 − T2 + T3 + T4.

AN HDG FOR MAXWELL EQUATIONS

Proof. By the adjoint equation (3.1) we have
keuk2

Ω = (eu, ∇ × θ − ∇σ)Th − (ew, θ − ∇ × φ)Th − (ep, ∇ · φ)Th

= (eu, ∇ × θ)Th − (ew, θ)Th

+ (ew, ∇ × φ)Th − (ep, ∇ · φ)Th
− (eu, ∇σ)Th

= (eu, ∇ × ΠW θ)Th − (ew, ΠW θ)Th + (eu, ∇ × (θ − ΠW θ))Th − (ew, θ − ΠW θ)Th

+ (ew, ∇ × ΠV φ)Th − (ep, ∇ · ΠV φ)Th + (ew, ∇ × (φ − ΠV φ))Th − (ep, ∇ · (φ − ΠV φ))Th
− (eu, ∇ΠQσ)Th − (eu, ∇(σ − ΠQσ))Th .

By integrating by parts and the orthogonal property of the projections, we have

keuk2

Ω = (eu, ∇ × ΠW θ)Th − (ew, ΠW θ)Th + het

u × n , θ − ΠW θi∂Th

+ (ew, ∇ × ΠV φ)Th − (ep, ∇ · ΠV φ)Th − hew , (φ − ΠV φ) × ni∂Th − hep , (φ − ΠV φ) · ni∂Th
− (eu, ∇ΠQσ)Th − heu · n , σ − ΠQσi∂Th .

Taking (r, v, q) = (ΠW θ, ΠV φ, ΠQσ) in the error equations (4.2a)-(4.2c), inserting these equations into the
above identity we have

keuk2

u × n , θ − ΠW θi∂Th

Ω = hebut × n , ΠW θi∂Th + het

− hu · n − bun
−hebut × n , θi∂Th = 0, hw − bwh , φ × ni∂Th = 0, he bp , φ · ni∂Th = 0, hu · n − bun

Notice by the regularity assumption of the adjoint problem, and (1.2d), (1.2e), (2.1d), (2.1e) we have

h · n , ΠQσi∂Th − heu · n , σ − ΠQσi∂Th .

h · n , σi∂Th = 0.

Inserting the above zero terms in the last expression of keuk2
This completes the proof.

Ω we obtain the desired identity in the lemma.
(cid:3)

Finally, we are ready to present the estimate for keukΩ.

Lemma 4.5. Under the same assumption as Lemma 4.3, in addition if the regularity assumption (3.2) holds
for the adjoint problem, then we have

keukΩ ≤ C(cid:16)ht+α−1kukt,Ω + hr+αkpkr,Ω + hs+αkwks,Ω(cid:17),

for 1 ≤ s ≤ k + 1, 1 ≤ r ≤ k + 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ k + 2 and 0 < α ≤ 1 is deﬁned in (3.2).

Proof. We will estimate T1-T4 in the above Lemma separately. For T1, we rewrite it into two parts:

T1 = h(PMet

u − ebut ) × n , θ − ΠW θi∂Th + h(et

u − PMet

u) × n , θ − ΠW θi∂Th := T11 + T12.

Applying Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on T11 and then (4.1d), we have

the last step is due to the regularity condition (3.2). For T12, we will apply a similar argument as the estimate
for T12 in Lemma 4.3. Namely, for any η ∈ Pk+2(Th), by (4.1d) and (3.2), we have
u + (∇η)t)) × n , θ − ΠW θi∂Th

For T3 and T4, we can use the expressions in the proof of Lemma 4.2 below (4.3).

T3 = hw − ΠW w + τt(PMet

u − ebut k∂Th + τtku − ΠV uk∂Th).

By (4.1b), (4.1d) and then (3.2), we obtain

T4 can be estimated in a similar way with the following bound:

τt = O( 1
(cid:3)

h ), τn = O(h).

Finally, by triangle inequality and (4.1a), (4.1c), Theorem 3.1 is a direct consequence of Lemmas 4.3, 4.5.

n kep − e bpk∂Th in Lemma 4.3, we can also derive the error
Remark 4.6. Besides we get the error estimate for τ
estimate for k∇epkΩ. Actually, this can be obtained by taking v = ∇ep in the error equation (4.2b) and
applying integration by parts, the Cauchy- Schwarz inequality, trace inequality and the estimates in Lemma
4.3 and Theorem 3.1. Then the error estimate for k∇(p − ph)kΩ can be further deduced by the triangular
inequality.

5. A special case on simplex meshes with τn = 0

As indicated in the Remark 2.2, by taking τn = 0 we can obtain globally divergence free electric ﬁeld uh.

However, in order to ensure well-posedness of the scheme, we need to restrict on simplex meshes.

Lemma 5.1. If Th is a simplex triangulation of the domain, the linear system (2.1) is still well posed if
τn = 0, τt > 0.

Proof. Since most of the arguments are similar to the proof of Lemma 2.1, we will only point out the few
places that are diﬀerent from the original proof. First, due to the choice of τn = 0, the energy identity 2.2
becomes

(wh, wh)Th + hτt(PMut

h × ni∂Th = 0.

Hence we can only obtain:

With same lines we can also obtain

wh = 0 and PMut

h × n − but

h × n), uh × n − but
h −but

h = 0

on ∂Th.

Since here we don’t have ph − bph = 0 directly from (2.2), we need a special treatment for (2.3). Namely, by

integrating by parts, we have

bwh = 0, ∇ × uh = 0.

(5.1)

(∇ph, v)Th + hbph − ph, v · ni∂Th = 0,

for all v ∈ V h.

On each K ∈ Th, we choose v ∈ P k+1(K) to satisfy the following equations:

AN HDG FOR MAXWELL EQUATIONS

11

(v, ˜v)K = (∇ph, ˜v)K ,

hv · n , µiF = hbph − ph , µiF ,

for all ˜v ∈ P k(K),
for all µ ∈ Pk(F ), F ∈ ∂K.

The existence of such v is ensured if K is simplex. For instance, by the above degrees of freedom uniquely
deﬁne a function v ∈ RTk(K) ⊂ P k+1(K). Here RTk(K) denotes the Raviert-Thomas space of degree k
on the simplex K. By this special choice of v, (5.1) gives

This implies that

(∇ph, ∇ph)Th + hbph − ph,bph − phi∂Th = 0

and hence ph = bph = 0. The rest of the proof follows exactly the same lines as in the proof of Lemma

2.1.

(cid:3)

∇ph = 0,

bph − ph = 0,

With τn = 0, we could improve the error estimates as follows:

Theorem 5.2. If Th is a simplex triangulation of Ω and τn = 0, τt = O( 1
solution (u, w, p) of (1.2) as in the Theorem 3.1 holds, then we have

h ), the regularity of the exact

k∇ · (u − uh)kTh = 0,

kw − whkΩ + k∇ × (u − uh)kTh ≤ C(cid:16)ht−1kukt,Ω + hskwks,Ω(cid:17),

for all 1 ≤ s ≤ k + 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ k + 2.

In addition, if the regularity (3.2) holds for the adjoint problem, then we have

ku − uhkΩ ≤ C(cid:16)ht+α−1kukt,Ω + hs+αkwks,Ω(cid:17),

where 0 < α ≤ 1 is deﬁned in (3.2).

Notice that comparing above result with the Theorem 3.1, we can see that the errors for u, w are inde-
pendent of the Lagrange multiplier p. The main ingredient for the proof is the use of the BDM projection
instead of L2-projection for the variable u. More precisely, we deﬁne

ΠV u = Πk+1

BDMu,

here Πk+1
BDMu is the BDM projection of u in Pk+1(K), for all K ∈ Th. For all other unknowns we still use
the L2-projections in the corresponding spaces. With this modiﬁcation, we will brieﬂy sketch the proof of
the above result by going through the changes in Lemma 4.2 - Lemma 4.5.

First, the basic inequalities (4.1) still hold. In addition, it is easy to verify the error equations in Lemma
4.2 remain the same form. As a consequence, the energy identity in Lemma 4.2 is still valid since it is only
based on algebraic manipulation of the error equations. However, in this case T3, T4 and τnkep − e bpk2
vanish since τn = 0 and the orthogonal property of the Πk+1
reduced energy identity as

∂Th
BDM on the interfaces. Therefore, we have a

kewk2

Ω + τtkPMet
= −hw − ΠW w , (et

u − ebut k2
u − ebut ) × ni∂Th − hτtPM(ut − (ΠV u)t) × n , (et

∂Th

u − ebut ) × ni∂Th .

Next we only need the bounds for the two terms in the right-hand side of the above identity (T1, T2). The
estimates for these two terms remain the same as in the proof of Lemma 4.3. Hence, Lemma 4.3 reduces to
the following estimates:

(5.2)

kewkΩ + τ

t kPMet

u − ebut k∂Th + k∇ × eukTh ≤ C(cid:16)ht−1kukt,Ω + hskwks,Ω(cid:17),

for 1 ≤ s ≤ k + 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ k + 2. Notice in the estimate we don’t have k∇ · eukTh on the left hand side since
∇ · eu = 0 by Remark 2.2.

Finally, for the duality argument (Lemma 4.4), we need to modify the projection on the dual variable φ

to be

eΠV φ = Πk

RTφ,

12

HUANGXIN CHEN, WEIFENG QIU, AND KE SHI

here Πk
RT denotes the RT projection onto the local space RTk(K) ∈ Pk+1(K). Under this modiﬁcation,
the derivation of the dual identity still holds since most of the argument is only algebraic manipulation

and the modiﬁed projection eΠV shares the same orthogonal property as the L2-projection for the spaces

∇ × W h + ∇Qh. Therefore the proof of Lemma 4.4 is still valid. In addition, by the property of the RT
projection, we have

since on each ep − e bp ∈ Pk(F ) for each F ∈ ∂Th. For the last term T4, we have

T2 = hep − e bp , (φ − eΠV φ) · ni∂Th = 0,

T4 = hu · n − buh · n − eu · n , σ − ΠQσi∂Th

= h(u − ΠV u) · n − (buh · n − uh · n) , σ − ΠQσi∂Th

by Remark 2.2,

= h(u − ΠV u) · n , σ − ΠQσi∂Th ,
= h(u − ΠV u) · n , σi∂Th
= h(u − ΠV u) · n , σi∂Ω = 0.

This implies that the dual identity reduces to be:

keuk2

Ω =h(et
:=T1 + T3.

u − ebut ) × n , θ − ΠW θi∂Th + hw − bwh − ew , (φ − eΠV φ) × ni∂Th

To conclude, we only need the same estimates for T1, T3 in the proof of Lemma 4.5 to obtain the error

estimate for eu as

(5.3)

keukΩ ≤ C(cid:16)ht+α−1kukt,Ω + hs+αkwks,Ω(cid:17),

for 1 ≤ s ≤ k + 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ k + 2 and 0 < α ≤ 1 is deﬁned in (3.2). We can obtain the ﬁnal estimates in
Theorem 5.2 by (5.2), (5.3), (4.1) and the triangle inequality.
