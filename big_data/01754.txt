IDENTIFIABILITY OF ELECTRICAL AND
HEAT TRANSFER PARAMETERS USING

COUPLED BOUNDARY

MEASUREMENTS

Chang, Yifan

March 8, 2016

1 Abstract

In this paper, we show that a hybrid method using coupled boundary measurements can
determine electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and the product of heat capacity
and heat density within a bounded domain on the plane uniquely up to a boundary-ﬁxing
diﬀromorphism.

2 Introduction

It is a classical problem to try to determine the internal structure of an object by
collecting external information. There are many examples of successful approaches to
this type of question: CT in medical imaging, seismic imaging in geophysical prospection,
and nondestructive testing in industry. In recent years, particularly in medical imaging,
there has been interest in developing hybrid methods, i.e. combining diﬀerent imaging
techniques. This idea has proven to be useful, since a given method can provide extra
interior information for another which can be used to get a better resolution: see [4],
[18], [20], [26], [24], [10].

In [17], the authors proved uniqueness for a new hybrid method they proposed to
determine both the electrical and heat transfer parameters within some bounded domain
in Rn, n ≥ 3, by using coupled boundary measurements. In this paper, we generalize
their results to the two dimensional case.

Given a bounded domain Ω ⊂ R2 with smooth boundary, we consider two physical
2 (∂Ω) at the boundary ∂Ω, and
processes. First, we put a voltage distribution f (x) ∈ H
assuming there are no sinks or sources inside Ω, the resulting voltage distribution u(x)
throughout the whole domain is governed by the conductivity equation

1

∇ · (γ(x)∇u(x)) = 0, x ∈ Ω

and u|∂Ω = f.

(1)

Here γ(x) is the electrical conductivity of Ω, the ﬁrst unknown we want to determine.
Since γ(x) may be anisotropic, it is represented by a positive deﬁnite matrix at each
point, and we assume it is bounded below by a positive number. The standard existence
theory assures us that for each f (x) ∈ H
2 (∂Ω), there exists a unique solution u(x) ∈
H 1(Ω) for (1). We can also let the boundary voltage distribution vary in time, i.e.
f = f (x, t) depends on t. For any ﬁxed time t0, we can still solve (1) in the same way
to get a voltage distribution u(x, t) that depends on t.

1

The second process is heat transfer. It is known that current generates heat which
will diﬀuse throughout the domain. We model this by considering the temperature
distribution ψ(x), which is governed by the heat equations

κ−1(x)∂tψ(x, t) = ∇ · (A(x)∇ψ(x, t)) + S(x, t), x ∈ Ω and t ≥ 0,
∀x ∈ ∂Ω and t ≥ 0,

∀x ∈ Ω ψ(x, t) = 0,

ψ(x, 0) = 0,

(2)

(3)

where κ(x) = c(x)−1ρ(x)−1 is the reciprocal of the product of the heat capacity c(x)
and density ρ(x) and A(x) = (aij(x)) is the thermal conductivity. The term S(x, t),
which is called the energy density of the electrical ﬁeld, is given by S(x, t) = ∇u(x, t) ·
γ(x)∇u(x, t), where u(x, t) is the solution for (1) and will act as a source term in the
heat equation. The initial and boundary condition (3) means that the temperature is
zero (after some shift) at ﬁrst and the boundary temperature is kept at 0 for all t ≥ 0.
We will assume that the heat transfer is suﬃciently slow so that the quasistatic model
(1) for the voltage u(x) is still realistic, as in [17].

Deﬁne coupled boundary measurements, namely the voltage-to-heat ﬂow map Σγ,κ,A,

as follows:

Σγ,κ,A :

f (x, t) ⇒ ν · A∇ψ(x, t), x ∈ ∂Ω.

(4)

That is, we set a time-dependent voltage f (x, t) at the boundary, and measure the
out-coming heat ﬂow ν · A∇ψ(x, t). We study what information about the internal
parameters γ, κ, and A, can we recover from the boundary measurements Σγ,κ,A.

The question to determine the inside conductivity by using voltage-to-current mea-
surements at the boundary is known as Calder´on’s inverse problem. It was ﬁrst proposed
by Alberto Calder´on who came across it while working as an engineer in the 1940’s and
published his result [7] in 1980. Since then, Calder´on’s problem has both been applied
in industry and become of further theoretical interest. In geophysical prospection, the
Schlumberger-Doll company was founded to ﬁnd oil by using electromagnetic meth-
ods. In medical imaging, Calder´on’s inverse problem is known as Electrical Impedance
Tomography, which has been used for detecting pulmonary emboli (cf.
[11]). Mathe-
matically, there have been many results on uniqueness ([7], [16], [30], [31], [13], [12], [9],
[23], [2]), stability ([1]), reconstruction and the corresponding numerical methods ([22],
[21], [25], [5]). See [33], [34] for general reviews. For the question of determining the
heat parameters through boundary measurements, there have also been some results [8],
[14], [15].

Unlike [17], where the authors consider isotropic conductivity and show that Σγ,κ,A de-
termines the parameters γ, κ and A uniquely, we allow the conductivity to be anisotropic,
and may encounter some nonuniqueness as a consequence. As we know for the anisotropic

2

Calder´on’s problem, given any boundary-ﬁxing diﬀeomorphism F , we can deﬁne the
pushforward of γ as F∗γ(x) = DF γDF T
◦ F −1(x), and this satisﬁes Λγ = ΛF∗γ since
|DF|
the conductivity equation is independent of the choice of coordinates. In the two di-
mensional case, it has been proved that this will be the only obstacle to uniqueness: for
more details, see [32], [19], [28], [3]. Similarly we can do the same change of coordinates
for the heat equation, so for this new hybrid method, the best one can hope for is that
Σγ,κ,A determines the parameters uniquely up to a boundary-ﬁxing diﬀeomorphism. We
prove that this is indeed the case:

Theorem 1 Assume Ω ⊂ R2 is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, κi(x) ∈
C∞( ¯Ω), κi > c > 0 for some c, γi(x), Ai(x) ∈ C∞( ¯Ω) is positive deﬁnite and bounded
blow by a positive number, i = 1, 2. If Σγ1,κ1,A1 = Σγ2,κ2,A2, then there exists a smooth
diﬀeomorphism F : ¯Ω ⇒ ¯Ω, which ﬁxes the boundary, i.e. F |∂Ω = id, such that κ2(x) =
κ1|DF | ◦ F −1(x), γ2(x) = DF γ1DF T
◦ F −1(x), where
DF = ( ∂Fi
∂xj

◦ F −1(x) and A2(x) = DF A1DF T

|DF|

)ij is the Jacobian matrix of F .

|DF|

We remark that the regularity assumption is not optimal and may be improved by
a more reﬁned analysis. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 3 we
explain the outline of the proof. In Section 4 we do a brief review of the nonuniqueness
caused by the change of coordinates.
In Section 5, we show that the conductivity is
determined uniquely up to a boundary-ﬁxing diﬀeomorphism. An important density
argument is proved in Section 6 and after that in Section 7, we show how to determine
the heat parameters up to the same diﬀeomorphism as in Section 5. From now on, we
will use the same regularity assumptions without further mentioning.

3 Outline of the Proof

In this section, we give the outline of the proof for Theorem 1.

• First, we recover the quadratic form related to the conductivity equation (1) from
the voltage-to-heat ﬂow map Σγi,κi,Ai. This is done by taking special input data
(almost static ones), and the physical interpretion is that in the static case, the
quadratic form stands for the energy needed to maintain the boundary voltage due
to the energy lost by the heat eﬀect caused by the current, so this energy should
be equal with the heat energy coming out. Then based on the exiting result for
the two dimensional Calder´on’s problem, we prove that the two conductivities are
the same up to certain boundary-ﬁxing diﬀeomorphism.

• The conductivity equation (1) and the heat equation (2) are related through the
electrical energy density Si(x, t) = ∇ui(x, t) · γi(x)∇ui(x, t), which is the outcome
of (1) and acts as an input of (2). Now we consider particularly the case that the
boundary voltage f is separated in x and t, i.e. fi(x, t) = h(x)g(t), then the corre-
sponding solutions will have the form ui(x, t) = ui0(x)g(t), where ui0 is the static
solution with boundary value h(x), and Si(x, t) = (∇ui0(x) · γi(x)∇ui0(x))g(t).

3

Deﬁne a bilinear form Bi(ui, vi) , ∇ui(x) · γi(x)∇vi(x) where ui, vi are solutions
of (1) with conductivity γi. Since (2) together with (3) are a linear system, having
the quadratic form Si(x, t) = Bi(ui0, ui0)g(t) as input is equivalent with having the
bilinear form B(ui0, vi0)g(t) as input. Next we show the space spanned by those
bilinear form B(ui0, vi0) are actually dense in L2(Ω)(then space spanned by the
quadratic form is also dense, we just use the bilinear form for simplicity), which
means that Σγi,κi,Ai actually contain information for putting arbitrary variable-
separated source S(x, t) = w(x)g(t) into (2). The method to prove density is to
use special solutions to the related Schr¨odinger equation(including the Complex
Geometric Optic solutions, or CGO solutions for short, and the solutions used by
Bukhgeim in [6]).

• Based on the fact in the second step and a change of coordinates(resulting from
the ﬁrst step), the problem have become that if for any variable-separated source
S(x, t) = w(x)g(t), the heat ﬂow coming out are the same, then the heat parame-
ters must coincide. This is proved in [17]. The basic idea is to take special source
term(approximately w(x)δ(t)) and solve the heat equations using eigenfunctions
of the operator κi∇ · (Ai(x)∇) in some weighted L2 space. And with the help
of some boundary determination results, it can be proved that all the eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions of the two operator κi∇ · (Ai(x)∇) are the same, which leads
to A1 = A2 then κ1 = κ2.

4 Obstacle to uniqueness

In this section, we review some facts about the obstacle to uniqueness when we allow
anisotropic conductivities, i.e. a boundary-ﬁxing diﬀeomorphism of Ω, or in other words,
a change of coordinates and the results in this section are valid for any dimension.

In this whole section, we will assume that F : ¯Ω ⇒ ¯Ω is a smooth diﬀeomorphism of
¯Ω which ﬁx the boundary, i.e. F |∂Ω = id. We ﬁrst start with the conductivity equation
(1) and have the following result.

Lemma 1 If u(x) is a solution to (1), then ˜u(x) , u ◦ F −1(x) = u(F −1(x)) solves (1)
with conductivity ˜γ = F∗γ , DF γDF T
◦ F −1, which is sometimes called the pushforward
|DF|
of γ and DF = ( ∂Fi
)ij is the Jacobian matrix of F as usual. As a result, we have
∂xj
Λγ = ΛF∗γ, where Λγ is the standard Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DN map) as in the
Calder´on’s problem.

1

This can be shown in various ways instead of calculating directly, for example relate
the equation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator ∆g for some properly chosen metric, i.e.
g , |γ|
2 ∆gu and ˜u(x) solves (1) with conductivity ˜γ
is just another expression in diﬀerent coordinates for the fact that u solves the Laplace-
Beltrami equation which is deﬁned intrinsically. But we may have a problem when n = 2,
since the metric will not be well deﬁned then, we will ﬁx this problem later in the proof of

n−2 γ−1, then ∇·(γ(x)∇u(x)) = |g|

Lemma 2. Another way to see it is using the fact that u(x) solves (1) if and only if u(x)

minimize the energy Eγ(u) =RΩ ∇u(x)·γ(x)∇u(x) dx within the class of functions with

boundary value f . And the standard existence and uniqueness results for the solution
of (1) implies the existence of a global minimizer. An easy observation using a change of
coordinates shows that Eγ(u(x)) = EF∗γ(u ◦ F −1(x)). So u(x) minimize Eγ(·) implies
that u ◦ F −1 minimizes EF∗γ(·), which means u ◦ F −1 solves (1) with conductivity F∗γ.
To show that Λγ = ΛF∗γ, either use the Riemannian geometry approach which will be
explained below, or just calculate directly using the explicit expression plus the fact that
F is identity when restricted to the boundary.

Then we move on to the heat equation and show the following result.

Lemma 2 If ψ(x, t) solves the heat equation (2) with the initial and boundary value con-
dition (3). Deﬁne ˜κ(x) , |DF (F −1(x))|κ(F −1(x)), ˜ψ(x, t) , ψ(F −1(x), t), ˜S(x, t) ,
|DF (F −1(x))|−1S(F −1(x), t), ˜A(x) = F∗A(x) , DF ADF T
◦F −1(x), then ˜ψ(x, t) solves
|DF|
the system with parameters ˜κ(x), ˜A(x) and ˜S(x, t). As a result, the two system give the
same out-coming heat ﬂow at the boundary, i.e. ν · A∇ψ(x, t) = ν · ˜A∇ ˜ψ(x, t), x ∈ ∂Ω.

Proof 1 Denote that y = F (x), according to the deﬁnition, the only thing need to show
here is that
|DF (x)|−1∇x ·(A(x)∇xu(x)) = ∇y ·( ˜A(y)∇y ˜u(y)) = ∇y ·(F∗A(y)∇yu(F −1(y))) (5)
We will use the metric arguments mentioned above. First when n ≥ 3, ∀A(x) positive
deﬁnite with a positive lower bound, we associate it with a metric

gA(x) , |A(x)|

And here are some basic facts which can be veriﬁed easily.

• |gA| = |A|

• ∇ · (A(x)∇u(x)) = |gA|
• The metric associated with ˜A = F∗A is just the pullback of gA under F −1, i.e.
gF∗A = (F −1)∗gA. |F∗A(y)| = |DF (x)|2−n|A(x)|, |gF∗A(y)| = |DF (x)|−2|gA(x)|

2 ∆gAu = |A|

n−2 ∆gAu

Then it is easy to see that

∇x · (A(x)∇xu(x)) = |gA|

)

2 ∆g ˜A

u ◦ F −1 = |DF (x)|∇y · ( ˜A(y)∇y ˜u(y))

To show that ν · A∇ψ(x, t) = ν · ˜A∇ ˜ψ(x, t), we can either calculate directly, or relate
it with the interior product of ∇gu and the volume form dgV since we have the relation

(∇gψ y dgV )|∂Ω = (ν · A∇ψ(x, t))dS,

(7)

5

where dS is the Euclidean volume form restricted to ∂Ω. Then we get what we want since
∇gψ y dgV is independent of the choice of coordinates plus the fact that F is identity at
the boundary.

When n = 2, we can not use the arguments above since the term |A(x)|

n−2 in (6)
makes no sense, or from another perspective, in the Laplace-Beltrami operator ∆g =
|g|− 1
2 g−1 always has determinant one for the two dimen-
sional case, which is not satisﬁed by general A. We ﬁx this by normalize A ﬁrst, deﬁne

Then just simply take a metric g = A−1, we get

∇ · (A(x)∇u(x)) = ∆gu+ < ∇g log |A|

and similarly, ∇·( ˜A(y)∇˜u(y)) = ∆˜g ˜u+ < ∇˜g log | ˜A|
2 , ∇˜g ˜u >˜g. Notice that when n = 2,
˜g , ˜A−1 does not coincides with (F −1)∗(g), but satisﬁes that ˜g(y) = |DF (x)|(F −1)∗g(y).
Combined the fact that |A(x)| = | ˜A(y)|, we have

1

∆˜g ˜u(y) = |DF (x)|−1∆gu(x), < ∇ log | ˜A|

1

2 , ∇˜u >˜g |y = |DF |−1 < ∇ log |A|

2 , ∇u >g |x,

which ﬁnishes the proof that ˜ψ solves the equation with ˜κ, ˜A and ˜S.

To show ν · A∇ψ(x, t) = ν · ˜A∇ ˜ψ(x, t), we can also either calculate directly or use
the same arguments mentioned above with some small modiﬁcation. Notice that when
n = 2, the relation (7) becomes

|g|− 1

2 (∇gψ y dgV )|∂Ω = (ν · A∇ψ(x, t))dS.

(8)

Then use the fact ˜g(y) = |DF (x)|(F −1)∗g(y), |˜g(y)| = |g(x)|, d(F −1)∗gV = |DF |−1d˜gV ,
∇(F −1)∗g

˜ψ = |DF |∇˜g ˜ψ, we get

∇gψ y dgV |x = (∇(F −1)∗gψ y d(F −1)∗gV )|y = ∇˜gψ y d˜gV |y,

plus the fact that F is identity at the boundary, we ﬁnish the proof.

5 Determination of the Conductivity

In this section, we recover the conductivity from Σγ,κ,A, most of the arguments fol-
low from [17]. We start with a property that will be used to solve the heat equa-
tion. Consider the operator P , −κ∇ · (A∇) in the weighted L2 space L2
κ−1(Ω)
with weight function κ−1(x), i.e.
the space equipped with the weighted inner prod-

uct < u, v >κ−1= RΩ u¯vκ−1 dx, we start with the domain of P as C∞0 (Ω) and then

0 (Ω) ∩ H 2(Ω). It is well known that, given κ, A both positive with lower
extend it to H 1
bounds strictly greater than zero, P is positive self-adjoint, furthermore the spectrum of

6

P consist of real positive eigenvalues {λi}∞i=1 of ﬁnite multiplicity which accumulating
at +∞(we may assume that λi is non-decreasing), and the corresponding eigenfunctions
{φi}∞i=1 form an orthonormal basis of L2

κ−1(Ω).

And now we return to the topic of this section, determining the conductivity through
Σγ,κ,A. The method used here have a strong physical interpretation. Recall that ac-
cording to the classical theory of Calder´on problem, the conductivity is determined
by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map Λγ up to a boundary-ﬁxing diﬀeomorphism. And
knowing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map Λγ is actually equivalent with knowing the

quadratic form, or the energy function Qγ(f ) = Eγ(u) = Λγ f (f ) = R∂Ω γ∇u · n dS =
RΩ ∇u · γ∇u dx, where u is the solution to (1) with boundary value f . The physical

meaning of Q(f ) = Eγ (u) is that, it is the energy needed to maintain the boundary volt-
age f . We know that energy is conservative, so it must transfer into some other form,
and the answer is heat. So it is quite nature to expect that in the static case, i.e. when
we ﬁx the boundary voltage to be f and wait long enough so that the temperature does
not change, the energy we put into the system should equal to the heat coming out, i.e.

assume u and ψ solves the static conductivity and heat equation, i.e. u, v solve (1),

Q(f ) = Eγ(u) = −R∂Ω A∇ψ · n dS = −R∂Ω Σγ,κ,Af dS. This can be proved as follows,
(2) and don’t depend on t, then R∂Ω A∇ψ · n dS = RΩ ∇ · (A∇ψ) dx = −RΩ S(x) dx =
−RΩ ∇u · γ∇u dx. This is just an intuitive proof since in this case ψ doesn’t satisfy the
data f (x, t) = f (x), and show that R∂Ω(Σγ,κ,Af )(x, t) dS → −Qγ(f ), as t → +∞
Lemma 3 If we take f (x, t) = f (x), then limt→+∞R∂Ω(Σγ,κ,Af )(x, t) dS = −Qγ(f ).

initial condition. But it gives us the essential idea and now we prove it rigorously. The
idea is still the same, we try to recover the quadratic form Qγ by taking the static input

Proof 2 Assume u0(x) solves (1) with the static boundary data f (x, t) = f (x), then
the source term will also be static (independent of t), S(x, t) = S(x) = ∇u0 · γ∇u0 and

Qγ(f ) = RΩ S(x) dx. After that we solve the heat equation (2) by the decomposition

ψ(x, t) = ψ0(x) + ψ1(x, t), where ψ0(x) solves the static heat equation with the static
source term,

∇ · (A∇ψ0(x)) + S(x) = 0, x ∈ Ω, ψ0(x) = 0,

∀x ∈ ∂Ω,

(9)

and ψ1(x, t) ﬁx the initial condition,

κ−1∂tψ1 = ∇ · (A∇ψ1), ψ1(x, 0) = −ψ0(x), ∀x ∈ Ω, ψ1(x, t) = 0, ∀x ∈ ∂Ω.

(10)

From the standard existence theory, we know there is always a unique ψ0(x) ∈ H 1
solves (9). Also notice that

0 (Ω)

Z∂Ω

A∇ψ0 · n dS =ZΩ

∇ · (A∇ψ0) dx = −ZΩ

S(x) dx = −Qγ(f ).

And for φ1, we solve it by using the eigenfunction expansion as follows. First we do the
eigenfunction decomposition for the initial value −ψ0,

− ψ0(x) =

∞Xi=1

aiφi(x),

ai =< −ψ0, φi >κ−1= −ZΩ

ψ0 ¯φiκ−1 dx.

(11)

7

Plug this into the equation, we get ψ1(x, t) =P∞i=1 aie−λitφi(x). Since λi ≥ λ1 > 0, we

know that ψ1 converge to 0 exponentially as t → +∞, so is the out-coming heat ﬂow for
ψ1. Then we have

t→+∞Z∂Ω

lim

(Σγ,κ,Af )(x, t) dS =Z∂Ω

A∇ψ0 · n dS = −Qγ(f )

.

In this way we recover the quadratic form Qγ, then according to the theory for the two
dimensional Calder´on’s problem (see [2], [3] for reference), this determine the conductiv-
ity up to a boundary-ﬁxing diﬀeomorphism, and we also have some recovering algorithms
for it.

Lemma 4 If Σγ1,κ1,A1 = Σγ2,κ2,A2, then there is a boundary-ﬁxing diﬀeomorphism F
of ¯Ω, s.t. γ2 = F∗γ1

6 A Density Argument

In this section, we prove the density argument mentioned in Section 2 as a preparation
for determining the heat parameters. The main result is stated as follows.

Lemma 5 Assume γ is regular enough, then the space spanned by ∇u(x) · γ(x)∇v(x),
where u(x) and v(x) are arbitrary solutions of (1), is dense in L2(Ω).

In order to show span{∇u(x) · γ(x)∇v(x)} is dense, we prove that span{∇u(x) ·

γ(x)∇v(x)}⊥ = 0, i.e. if f (x) ∈ L2(Ω) satisﬁes that RΩ f (x)∇u(x) · γ(x)∇v(x) dx = 0

for any pair of solutions u(x) and v(x), then f = 0.

First we claim that since now we are working in the two dimensional case, we may
assume that γ is isotropic, i.e. γ = γ(x)I. Since it have been proved in [3] that ∀γ, there
is a quasiconformal homeomorphism F ∈ W 1,p
loc (C; C) of the whole plane with asymptotic
behaviour F (z) = z + O( 1
2 I, i.e. we can ﬁnd a change
of coordinates to convert any anisotropic conductivity to a isotropic one. And it is
not hard to see that f ⊥ span{∇u(x) · γ(x)∇v(x)} is equivalent with (f ◦ F −1) ⊥
span{∇(u ◦ F −1) · F∗γ(x)∇(v ◦ F −1)}, so the density of span{∇u(x) · γ(x)∇v(x)}
in L2(Ω) is equivalent with the density of span{∇(u ◦ F −1) · F∗γ(x)∇(v ◦ F −1)} in
L2(F (Ω)).

z ), such that F∗γ = det(γ ◦ F −1)

1

To show that f = 0, we use some special solutions of (1). The outline is that we ﬁrst
use the CGO solutions to show that f χΩ ∈ H s(R2) for any s > 0. Then by the Sobolev
embedding, we know that f must vanish to inﬁnite order at the boundary ∂Ω(actually
we only need it to vanish to the second order). Then we can apply integration by parts

0 = RΩ f ∇u · γ∇v dx = 1

2RΩ f ∇ · (γ∇(uv)) dx = 1

2RΩ ∇ · (γ∇(f ))uv dx. After that,

use the Liouville transform and the solutions Bukhgeim proposed in [6], we derive that
1
γ ∇·(γ∇(f )) = 0 in Ω. Combining the facts that f vanishes to all orders at the boundary
(once again, we only need it to vanish to the ﬁrst order), the unique continuation results
for elliptic equations show that f = 0 which ﬁnishes the proof.

8

So now we focus on the ﬁrst key ingredient in the proof, prove the smoothness of f χΩ

by using CGO solutions.

Lemma 6 Assume γ is smooth enough, then if f ∈ L2(Ω), f ⊥ span{∇u(x)·γ(x)∇v(x)},
where u, v are arbitrary solutions to (1), then f χΩ ∈ H s(R2) for any s > 0.

Recall the standard Liouville transform that transform (1) into a Schr¨odinger equation
with potential q = ∆√γ
√γ . In [27], the authors proved that if g ⊥ span{uv}, where u and
v are the solutions to the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation, then gχΩ ∈ H s(R2) for
0 < s < 1. They used pairs of CGO solutions whose product was approximately eik·x
to derive estimates for the Fourier transform of gχΩ for large k. We extend this result
and show that gχΩ actually belongs to H s(R2) for any s > 0 and similar arguments can
be used to show that f χΩ ∈ H s(R2), ∀s > 0 when we come back to the conductivity
equation.

2 (±k⊥ + ik) (the factor 1

First we review and modify the construction of CGO solutions for the Schr¨odinger
equation, which was ﬁrst introduced in [29]. For ∀η ∈ C2 large enough, s.t. η · η = 0, or
equivalently η = 1
2 is just for notation simplicity), ∀k ∈ R2 with
suﬃciently large norm and k⊥ stands for the vector obtained by rotating k clockwise
by π
2 , we construct CGO solution u for the Schr¨odinger equation in the form u(x, k) =
eη·x(1 + r(x, k)). The correction term r(x, k) can be proved to be small in certain norm
(like the W 2,p(Ω) norm) by solving r(x, k) out explicitly. Actually it was shown in [29]
that for η = 1

2 (k⊥ + ik), we have an expansion for the correction term r(x, k),

r(x, k) =

a(x)
i¯k

+

b(x, k)
(i¯k)2

,

(12)

where we have uniform bounds(in k) for the norm of b(x, k). And based on this, [27]
showed that gχΩ ∈ H s(R2), 0 < s < 1 if g ⊥ span{usvs}. To extend the result to any
s > 0, we need to modify the expansion (12) with the following result.

Lemma 7 ∀n ∈ N+, when the potential q is regular enough(like in C n+2( ¯Ω)) and |k| is
large enough(depends on ||q||C n+2( ¯Ω)), we can construct CGO solutions with correction
term r(x, k) in the following form,

r(x, k) =

n−1Xj=1

aj(x)
(i¯k)j +

bn(x, k)
(i¯k)n

,

(13)

where aj = (−2∂ + χP q)j−1χP q, χ(x) is any smooth cut-oﬀ function which equals 1 in
Ω, the norm of b (like the W 2,p(Ω) norm) is bounded by the norm of q (like the W 2,p(Ω)
norm) and independent of k.

In the following, we will use the usual notation ∂ = 1

2 (∂x + i∂y) and
switch between vector and complex notation without further mentioning, for example
k, x stands for the vector (k1, k2)T , (x1, x2)T while k, z stands for the complex number
¯kz(1 + r(x, k)) solves the Schr¨odinger
k1 + ik2, x1 + ix2. Then eη·x(1 + r(x, k)) = e

equation (−∆ + q)u = 0 is equivalent with (∆ + 2η · ∇ − q)r = q, or written in complex

notation (4 ¯∂∂ + 2i¯k ¯∂ − q)r = q. This is solved by ﬁrst formally setting r =P∞1 ri, where
ri satisﬁes (4 ¯∂∂ + 2i¯k ¯∂)ri = qri−1(r0 = 1), then proving the summation converges(this
is where we need |k| to be large enough) and solves the equation. So the core of the
problem have reduced to solve the following equation inside the domain,

(4 ¯∂∂ + 2i¯k ¯∂)r = f.

(14)

The ﬁrst thing to do is factorize the equation like 2 ¯∂(2∂ + i¯k)r = f . Instead of solving
it inside the domain, we extend f and do all the operations on the whole plane while
only requiring the constructed solution satisﬁes the equation inside Ω. Notice that, there
are various way to extend f , later on we will actually need the extension to be regular
enough. Then we can ﬁrst invert the ¯∂ equation by the standard Cauchy transform P ,
i.e. P f (z) = 1
z−w dw, where dw is the usual Lebesgue measure on
the plane (we have modiﬁed the standard deﬁnition by a factor of 1
2 for simplicity). The
properties of P have been studied quite carefully, see [35] for instance. If f is regular
enough, we know P f is always one more time diﬀerentiable than f and then P f solves
the equation in the weak sense implies P f also solves the equation in classical sense
point-wisely. So as mentioned above, since we only require the solution to solve the
equation inside the domain, we may multiply P f by a smooth cut-oﬀ function χ(x)
which is 1 inside Ω.

(z) = 1

Now we are trying to solve the equation

(2∂ + i¯k)r = g,

(15)

where we are taking g = χP f . Notice that 2∂(eik·x) = i¯keik·x, similar to integration
factor, we have (2∂ + i¯k)r = e−ik·x2∂eik·xr, which means that 2∂ + i¯k is actually 2∂
conjugated by eik·x. Then we can solve the equation (15) using ¯P , which is deﬁned as
the convolution with 1

¯z and acts as the inverse of 2∂, and get

r = e−ik ¯P (eikg) = e−ik ¯P (eikχP f ).

(16)

Due to the mapping properties of P and ¯P , if we solve the equation this way, the Lp
norm of r is the same order as the size of f and independent of k.

But the expansion structure is not very clear if we solve it like this. Instead since (15)
is a linear equation with constant coeﬃcient, we may solve it using Fourier transform
and get i(¯k + ¯w)ˆr(w) = ˆg(w), then ˆr(w) = 1

i¯k+i ¯w ˆg(w). Rewrite

Remember that d2∂g(w) = i ¯wˆg(w), so it is clear from here that why we require some

regularity for g = χP f , which can be obtained if we require some regularity for f . Then
if we take the inverse Fourier transform, we have

(19)

where r(n)(x, k) satisﬁes the equation (2∂ + i¯k)r(n) = (−2∂)ng = (−2∂)nχP f . Based on
the argument above, the Lp norm of r(n) can be controlled by the norm of D(n−1)f and
is independent of the size of k. To sum up, the more regularity we have in f , the higher
order we can expand in (13). We remark here that of course we can get the same result
here by setting

r =

(20)

directly and another thing is we will get the same solution no matter which order we
expand to, as long as they make sense, i.e. ∀n, m ∈ N+,

Now to get the expansion structure mentioned in Lemma 7, we ﬁrst regularly extend
the potential q to the whole plane with compact support by standard technique(∀m ∈
0 (R2) and we will still use q instead of qext for simplicity),
N+, we can make qext ∈ C m
then apply the above arguments to ri up to (n − i)-th order, 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 2 and sum them
up. The i-th order term has the form (−2∂ + χP q)i−1χP q can be proved by induction.

Finally the summation r =P∞i=0 ri converges and solves the equation can be proved by

the same arguments used in [29] which we are not going to repeat here since basically
we are talking about the same solutions. For instance, to get an expansion up to the
third order, we have

For ˜η = 1

the expansion expression for the corresponding correction term

˜bn(x, k)
(ik)n ,

˜aj = (−2 ¯∂ + χ ¯P q)j−1χ ¯P q

(25)

Now we can show Lemma 6 using Lemma 7. First we show the similar result for the
Schr¨odinger equation, which is actually a generalization of the results in [27]. To show
that ∀g ∈ span{uv}⊥, gχΩ belongs to H s(R2) for 0 < s < 1, they take CGO solutions

u = e( 1

2 (k⊥+ik))·x(1 + r(x, k)),

v = e( 1

2 (−k⊥+ik))·x(1 + ˜r(x, k)),

for |k| suﬃciently large. Plug these into the assumption RΩ guv dx = 0, they get

ZΩ

geik·x(1 + r + ˜r + r˜r) dx = 0 ⇒ dgχΩ(−k) =ZΩ

geik·x(r + ˜r + r˜r) dx.

(26)

Then they use the expansion (13), (25), up to the second order, to showed that | −

k|sdgχΩ(−k) is in L2(|k| > R) which implies gχΩ ∈ H s(R2) since only the large k
behaviour of dgχΩ matters. They stopped here since it was enough for their purpose,

while we can actually prove gχΩ ∈ H s for any ﬁxed s > 0 by expanding (13), (25) to
higher order plus a bootstrap process.

For instance, if we expand r and ˜r up to the third order, then (26) becomes

for |k| large and from here we can show that for 0 < s < 2, |−k|sdgχΩ(−k) ∈ L2(|k| > R),

g(x)˜b3(x, k)(1 + r(x, k))eik·x dx,

(ik)3 ZΩ

so gχΩ ∈ H s(R2).

• The terms in the ﬁrst line, like |−k|s
i¯k

\a1gχΩ(−k), belongs to L2(|k| > R) is based
on the fact that it have already been shown that gχΩ ∈ H t(R2) for 0 < t < 1,
a1 is a regular enough function(depends on the regularity of the extension of q)
with compact support, then a1gχΩ ∈ H t(R2), which means | − k|t \a1gχΩ(−k) ∈
L2(|k| > R).

• The terms in the second and third line, like | − k|s

\a2gχΩ(−k), belongs to
L2(|k| > R) since all the Fourier transform is in L2(R2) while the rest like | −

(i¯k)2

(i¯k)2 is bounded.

• The terms in the last line, like |−k|s

to L2(|k| > R) since |−k|s

(i¯k)3 RΩ g(x)b3(x, k)(1 + ˜r(x, k))eik·x dx, belongs
(i¯k)3 ∈ L2(|k| > R) given that 0 < s < 2 and the rest
RΩ g(x)b3(x, k)(1 + ˜r(x, k))eik·x dx is bounded in k by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
|ZΩ

g(x)b3(x, k)(1 + ˜r(x, k))eik·x dx| ≤ ||g||L2(Ω)||b3(x, k)||L4(Ω)||1 + ˜r(x, k)||L4(Ω).

The L4(Ω) norm here is in x variable but is uniformly bounded in k, which ﬁnishes
the proof.

In general, for any ﬁxed s > 0, we can show gχΩ ∈ H s(R2) by a bootstrap process like
above by expanding r and ˜r up to higher order, which require more regularity on the
potential and its extension. We remark here that this argument can be used to ﬁx the
little ﬂaw in [6], where it started with the assumption that g ∈ C 1( ¯Ω).

Now when we come back to the conductivity equation, just take the CGO solutions

obtained by the Liouville transform, i.e.

u = γ− 1

2 e( 1

2 (k⊥+ik))·x(1 + r(x, k)),

v = γ− 1

where R = R(x, k) = r(x, k) + ˜r(x, k) + r(x, k)˜r(x, k). The leading order in |k|
is actually the same as what we get in (26), so we can run the same arguments to
prove f χΩ ∈ H s(R2). Remember when proving the similar smoothness result for the
Schr¨odinger equation, we need some regularity for the potential function, which is now
related to the conductivity by the Liouville transform as q = γ− 1
2 . As a result, here
we need the conductivity to be regular enough to run the above arguments.

2 ∆γ

Now we are ready to prove Lemma 5.

13

Proof 3 The lemma is equivalent with that for any f ∈ L2(Ω), s.t. f ⊥ span{∇u·γ∇v},
where u, v are arbitrary solutions of (1), f is identically 0.

As mentioned above, we may assume the conductivity γ is isotropic. By Lemma 6, if
the conductivity is regular enough, we have f χΩ ∈ H s(R2), for any ﬁxed positive s. By
the Soblev embedding, f χΩ belongs to C m(R2), ∀m ∈ N+, which implies f ∈ C m(R2)
and vanishing to m-th order at the boundary.

In particular, we prove up to f χΩ ∈ C 3(R2) so both f and ∂ν f vanish at the boundary,

then by the assumption that f ⊥ span{∇u · γ∇v}, we have

0 =ZΩ

f ∇u · γ∇v dx =

1

2ZΩ

f ∇ · (γ∇(uv)) dx =

2ZΩ

∇ · (γ∇(f ))uv dx.

(28)

Use the Liouville transform, any solution u of (1) can be written as u = γ− 1

us is solution to the related Schr¨odinger equation. So we have RΩ

2 us, where
1
γ ∇ · (γ∇(f ))usvs dx =
γ ∇ · (γ∇(f )) ∈ C 1( ¯Ω), then it have
γ ∇ · (γ∇(f )) = 0 by using special constructed solutions and the

0. Since f ∈ C 3(R2) and γ is regular enough, 1
been shown in [6] that 1
stationary phase method.

Finally by the unique continuation result for elliptic equations, 1
together with both f and ∂ν f vanish at the boundary imply that f = 0.

γ ∇ · (γ∇(f )) = 0

We remark here that the methods used above to construct the CGO solutions can
also be used to construct the solutions Bukhgeim used in [6], i.e. ∀φ(x) = u(x) +
iv(x) analytic(or ˜φ = −u + iv anti-analytic), we construct solutions for the Schr¨odinger
equation in the form u(x) = eiτ φ(x)(1+r(x, τ ))(or v = eiτ ˜φ(1+ ˜r)). Since in this case, we
also have ∆eiτ φ(x) = 0(or ∆eiτ ˜φ = 0), and ∇φ(x) = ∇u(x) + i∇v(x) = (∇v)⊥ + i∇v(or
∇ ˜φ = −(∇v)⊥ + i∇v) due to the Cauchy-Riemann equation, which is quite similar with
the CGO solution where we have ∆eη·x = 0, ∇eη·x = η = 1
2 (k⊥ + ik). But we can not
get the similar expansion structure as we have in Lemma 7.

7 Determination of the Heat Parameters

With all the preparation above, we can now determine the heat parameters in this
section.

Assume F is the diﬀeomorphism obtained in Corollary 4, then according to the results
in Section 4 and the uniqueness for the Dirichlet boundary value problem for (1), we
have

u2(x, t) =u1(F −1(x), t)
S2(x, t) =∇u2(x, t) · γ2(x)∇u2(x, t) = ∇u1(F −1(x), t) · F∗γ1(x)∇u1(F −1(x), t)

we know that Σ˜γ1,˜κ1, ˜A1
S(x, t). As we mentioned above, we take special boundary data which is separated in
x and t, i.e. f (x, t) = h(x)g(t) then S(x, t) = (∇u(x) · γ(x)∇u(x))g(t), where u(x) is
arbitrary solution to (1). By the density arguments from Section 6, the linearity and
continuity of the heat equation, we know that the out-coming heat ﬂow are the same for
the two systems (one with coeﬃcients ˜κ1, ˜A1, the other with κ2, A2) when we replace
the source term S(x, t) in (2) with ¯S(x, t) = w(x)g(t), where w(x) is arbitrary function
in L2(Ω). From here, we can conclude that

κ2 = ˜κ1, A2 = ˜A1,

(31)

which has been proved in [17]. We are not going to repeat the proof here but the main
idea is to take special input in the form S(x, t) = w(x)δ(t), then solve the equations
using the eigenfunction expansions.

8 Summary

In summary, we generalize the higher dimensional uniqueness result for a new hybrid
method proposed in [17] to the two dimensional case. The main diﬃculty is to show a
density arguments, which is proved in Section 6. Since the two dimensional anisotropic
Calder´on’s inverse problem is well understood, in this paper we allow the conductivity
to be anisotropic and so we can only expect to have uniqueness up to a boundary-ﬁxing
diﬀeomorphism. The method actually doesn’t provide any interior information, so we
should not expect any improvement in stability while on the other hand, we can recover
three coeﬃcients all together and the use of electric boundary sources may be easier
than controlling the temperature at the boundary. Further work may include requiring
less regularity of the parameters, numerical reconstruction, improve the model since the
boundary voltage is varying in time, etc.
