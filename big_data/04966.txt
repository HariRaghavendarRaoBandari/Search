REMARKS ON DERIVATIVE NONLINEAR SCHR ¨ODINGER SYSTEMS

WITH MULTIPLE MASSES

CHUNHUA LI AND HIDEAKI SUNAGAWA

Abstract. We prove global existence of small solutions to the initial value problem for a
class of cubic derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger systems with the masses satisfying suitable
non-resonance relations. The large-time asymptotics of the solutions are also shown. This
work is intended to provide a counterpart of the previous paper [20] in which the mass
resonance case was treated.

This paper is a sequel to [20]. We continue the study of the initial value problem

x, i = √−1, mj ∈ R\{0}, and u = (uj(t, x))1≤j≤N is a CN -valued

where Lmj = i∂t + 1
unknown function. The nonlinear term F = (Fj)1≤j≤N is assumed to be a cubic homogeneous
polynomial in (u, ∂xu, u, ∂xu). Our main interest is how the combinations of (mj)1≤j≤N and
the structures of (Fj)1≤j≤N aﬀect the behavior of u(t) as t → ∞.
Let us ﬁrst recall backgrounds brieﬂy. As is well known, cubic nonlinearity is critical
when we consider the large-time behavior of solutions to nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation.
In general, cubic nonlinearity must be regarded as a long-range perturbation. According to
Hayashi-Naumkin [7], the solution u(t, x) to

(1.2)

behaves like

as t → ∞, where α is a suitable C-valued function. An important consequence of this
asymptotic expression is that the solution to (1.2) decays like O(t−1/2) uniformly in x ∈ R,
while it does not behave like the free solution. In other words, the additional logarithmic
factor in the phase reﬂects a typical long-range character of the cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equations in one space dimension. There are several extensions of this result. If we restrict
our attentions to the single case (N = 1), the most general case is considered in [11] (see
also the introduction of [22] for a survey of recent development on cubic derivative nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations in one space dimension). Next let us turn our attentions to the system

case (N ≥ 2). Recently, a lot of eﬀorts have been made for the study on systems of nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations with multiple masses (see e.g., [1], [4], [6], [19], [13], [21], [16], [15],
[14], etc.). An interesting feature in the system case is that the behavior of solutions are
aﬀected by the combinations of the masses as well as the structure of the nonlinearity. Note
that similar phenomena can be observed in critical nonlinear Klein-Gordon systems (see e.g.,
[25], [23], [2], [24], [18], [17]). In the previous paper [20], we have considered the case where
the masses satisfy suitable resonance relations. Roughly speaking, that is the case where the
operator Jm = x + it

which is valid only when m = µ1 + µ2 + µ3 (see the condition (a) in [20] for a precise
expression of the mass resonance condition). In [20], several structural conditions on the
cubic nonlinearity have been introduced under which the small data global existence holds,
and time-decay properties of the global solutions have been investigated. When we restrict
our attentions to the 2-component system

(1.4)

(1.5)

with m, µ ∈ R\{0} and κ, λ ∈ C\{0}, we can see that the conditions of [20] are satisﬁed
only if µ = 3m and Re(κλ) < 0, Im(κλ) = 0 (see Remark 5.2 below for the detail). We also
note that the system

(cid:26) Lmu = κu2∂xv,
Lµv = λu2∂xu,

t > 0, x ∈ R

(cid:26) Lmu = κ∂x(v3)
Lµv = λ∂x(u3)

t > 0, x ∈ R

is not covered by the result of [20] regardless of the ratio of m and µ.

In the present paper, we are interested in the non-resonance case, i.e., the case where (1.3)
is not valid. For simplicity of exposition, we concentrate our attentions to the simple model
systems (1.4) and (1.5) with the initial condition

(1.6)

u(0, x) = u0(x), v(0, x) = v0(x),

x ∈ R.

The general N-component system (1.1) will be discussed in the ﬁnal section.

To state our results, let us introduce some function spaces. For s, σ ∈ Z≥0, we denote by
H s the L2-based Sobolev space of order s, and the weighted Sobolev space H s,σ is deﬁned
by {φ ∈ L2 | hxiσφ ∈ H s}, equipped with the norm kφkH s,σ = khxiσφkH s. The main results
are as follows:
Theorem 1.1. Assume m 6= 3µ and µ 6= 3m. Let u0, v0 ∈ H 2 ∩ H 1,1, and assume ε :=
ku0kH 2∩H 1,1 + kv0kH 2∩H 1,1 is suﬃciently small. Then the initial value problem (1.5)–(1.6)
admits a unique pair of global solutions u, v ∈ C([0,∞); H 2 ∩ H 1,1). Moreover, there exist
u+, v+ ∈ L2(Rx) with ˆu+, ˆv+ ∈ L∞(Rξ) such that

Theorem 1.2. Assume µ 6= 3m and µ 6= 2m. Then the same assertion as Theorem 1.1
holds for the initial value problem (1.4)–(1.6).

Remark 1.1. In Theorem 1.2, we do not need any restrictions on κ and λ. This should be
contrasted with the resonance case µ = 3m. Indeed, if µ = 3m and (κ, λ) = (0, 1), we can
show that

t→∞kv(t)kL2 = ∞
lim

with a suitable choice of (u0, v0), which implies that v cannot be asymptotically free.

We close the introduction with the contents of this paper. The next section is devoted to
preliminaries. In Section 3, we will get an a priori estimate for the solution to (1.5)–(1.6),
and Theorem 1.1 will be proved in Section 4. In Section 5, we will give an outline of the
proof of Theorem 1.2. In Section 6, we will discuss a generalization of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2
to the N-component system (1.1).

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we summarize basic facts related to the Schr¨odinger operator Lm = i∂t +
x. In what follows, several positive constants are denoted by the same letter C, which

may vary from one line to another.

2.1. The operators Jm and P. We set Jm = x + it
m∂x and P = x∂x + 2t∂t. As is well-
known, these operators have good compatibility with Lm. We can check immediately that
(2.1)

(2.2)

[Lm,P] = 2Lm,

[Lm,Jm] = 0,

[∂x,Jm] = 1,

[∂x,P] = ∂x,

Jm∂x = P + 2itLm,

which will be used eﬀectively in Section 3.

2.2. Factorization of the free evolution group Um(t). We set

so that Um can be decomposed into Um = MmDFmMm = MmDWmFm. The following
lemmas are well-known.

Lemma 2.1. Let m be a non-zero real constant. We have

Lemma 2.2. Let m be a non-zero real constant. We have

m (f1f2f3)kL∞ ≤ Ckf1kL2kf2kL2kf3kL∞.

We skip the proof of these lemmas (see e.g., §3 of [20] and its references).

2.3. Smoothing properties. We recall smoothing properties of the linear Schr¨odinger
equations. Let H be the Hilbert transform, that is,
p.v.ZR

Hψ(x) :=

ψ(y)
x − y

With a non-negative weight function Φ(x) and a non-zero real constant m, let us also deﬁne
the operator SΦ,m by

Lemma 2.3. Let m, µ1, µ2 be non-zero real constants. Let f be a C-valued smooth function
of (t, x), and let w = (w1, w2) be a C2-valued smooth function of (t, x). We set Φ = η|w|2
with η ≥ 1, and S = SΦ(t,·),m. Then we have

Lemma 2.4. Let m1, m2 be non-zero real constants. Let f = (f1, f2), w = (w1, w2) be
C2-valued smooth functions of x ∈ R. Suppose that q is a quadratic homogeneous polynomial
in w. We set Φ = η|w|2 with η ≥ 1, and Sj = SΦ,mj for j = 1, 2. Then we have

3. A priori estimate for (1.5)–(1.6)

This section is devoted to getting an a priori estimate for the solution to (1.5)–(1.6).
Throughout this section, we always assume that µ 6= 3m, m 6= 3µ and u0, v0 ∈ H 2 ∩ H 1,1
with ε = ku0kH 2∩H 1,1 + kv0kH 2∩H 1,1. Let T ∈ (0,∞], and let u, v ∈ C([0, T ); H 2 ∩ H 1,1) be a
pair of solutions to (1.5)–(1.6) for t ∈ [0, T ). We set

We also deﬁne

with γ ∈ (0, 1/4). We are going to show the following:
Lemma 3.1. Assume m 6= 3µ and µ 6= 3m. There exist positive constants ε1 and K, not
depending on T, such that

(3.1)

implies

E(T ) ≤ ε2/3

C. LI AND H. SUNAGAWA

|α(t, ξ)| + |β(t, ξ)| ≤ K2εhξi−1

under the assumption (3.1), where K1 and K2 are positive constants not depending on
T . Then the desired estimate follows by setting K = K1 + K2. So our task is to show
these two estimates. Before going into the proof of them, let us point out the diﬀerences
between the approach in [20] and the present one. In the present setting, we cannot use
the operator Jm directly because the Leibniz-type rule is not valid for (1.5) without growth
in t. Instead of doing so, we use the dilation operator P through the relation (2.2). The
facts that P is independent of m, µ and obeys the usual Leibniz rule allow us to obtain
the ﬁrst estimate (3.2). This idea is originated by Hayashi-Naumkin [8] in the study of
the generalized Benjamin-Ono equation, and applied to single cubic derivative nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equations in [9], [10] (see also [22]). In the derivation of the second estimate
(3.3), we use the factorization of Um(t) and reduce the original system to simpler equations
satisﬁed by α, β. The oscillating factor in the reduced equation enables us to get the desired
estimate (3.3) under the non-resonance condition µ 6= 3m and m 6= 3µ. Similar idea was
used previously in [2], [24], [18], etc., for the Klein-Gordon case and in [5] for the ﬁnal state
problem for a quadratic nonlinear Schr¨odinger system.

3.1. L2-estimates. The goal of this part is to get (3.2). Proof is divided into ﬁve parts: we
will derive four kinds of L2-estimates ﬁrst, and then piece them together.

(i) Estimates for ku(t)kL2 and kv(t)kL2. We ﬁrst remark that (3.1) and Lemma 2.1 yield

ku(t)kW 1,∞ + kv(t)kW 1,∞ ≤
Then we see from the standard energy method that

whence

ku(t)kL2 + kv(t)kL2 ≤ Cε +Z t

Cε2

(1 + t′)1−γ/3 dt′ ≤ Cε(1 + t)γ/3.

(ii) Estimates for kJmu(t)kL2 and kJµv(t)kL2. We note that (2.1), (2.2) and (1.5) yield

Jm∂x(v3) = P(v3) + 2itLm(v3) = 3v2Pv + 2v3 + Lm(2itv3)

and

Pv = Jµ∂xv − 2itLµv = −v + ∂xJµv − 2iλt∂x(u3).

We also remember the commutation relation [Lm,Jm] = 0. From them it follows that

where

Lm(cid:0)Jmu − 2iκtv3(cid:1) = r,

r = −κv3 + 3κv2∂xJµv − 6iκλtv2u2∂xu.

DNLS SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLE MASSES

Since this r can be estimated as

krkL2 ≤

Cε2

(1 + t)1−γ/3 ,

the standard energy method leads to

kJmu − 2iκtv3kL2 ≤ kxu0kL2 +Z t

Cε2

(1 + t′)1−γ/3 dt′ ≤ Cε(1 + t)γ/3.

Therefore we obtain

kJmu(t)kL2 ≤ 2t|κ|kvk2

L∞kvkL2 + Cε(1 + t)γ/3 ≤ Cε(1 + t)γ/3.

In the same way, we have

kJµv(t)kL2 ≤ Cε(1 + t)γ/3.

xφkL2 + kJmφkL2 + kJm∂xφkL2(cid:1)

and that (2.2) yields

kJm∂xφkL2 ≤ kPφkL2 + 2tkLmφkL2.

Therefore, by piecing together the estimates obtained in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), we arrive at
the desired estimate (3.2).

3.2. Estimates for α(t, ξ) and β(t, ξ). The goal of this part is to prove (3.3). When
0 ≤ t ≤ 1, the desired estimates follows immediately from the Sobolev embedding. Hence
we have only to consider the case of t ∈ [1, T ).

It follows from the deﬁnition of α that

(cid:3)

In this section, we will prove Theorem 1.1. We ﬁrst recall the local existence. For ﬁxed

4. Proof of Theorem 1.1

(4.1)

t0 ≥ 0, let us consider the initial value problem

Lemma 4.1. Let ϕ, ψ ∈ H 2∩ H 1,1. There exists a positive constant ε0, not depending on t0,
such that the following holds: for any ε ∈ (0, ε0) and M ∈ (0,∞), one can choose a positive
constant τ ∗ = τ ∗(ε, M), which is independent of t0, such that (4.1)–(1.6) admits a unique
pair of solutions u, v ∈ C([t0, t0 + τ ∗]; H 2 ∩ H 1,1), provided that kϕk + kψkL2 ≤ ε and

∂x(cid:1)lψ(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)H 2−l(cid:17) ≤ M.

We omit the proof of this lemma because it is standard.

Now we are going to prove the global existence by the so-called bootstrap argument. Let
T ∗ be the supremum of all T ∈ (0,∞] such that the problem (1.5)–(1.6) admits a unique
pair of solutions u, v ∈ C([0, T ); H 2 ∩ H 1,1). By Lemma 4.1 with t0 = 0, we have T ∗ > 0 if
ku0kL2 + kv0kL2 ≤ ε < ε0. We also set

T∗ = sup(cid:8)τ ∈ [0, T ∗) | E(τ ) ≤ ε2/3(cid:9).

Note that T∗ > 0 because of the continuity of [0, T ∗) ∋ τ 7→ E(τ ) and E(0) ≤ Cε ≤ 1
2ε2/3 if
ε is suitably small. We claim that T∗ = T ∗ if ε is small enough. Indeed, if T∗ < T ∗, Lemma
3.1 with T = T∗ yields

E(T∗) ≤ Kε ≤

ε2/3

for ε ≤ ε2 := min{ε1, 1/(2K)3}, where K and ε1 are mentioned in Lemma 3.1. By the
continuity of [0, T ∗) ∋ τ 7→ E(τ ), we can take T ♭ ∈ (T∗, T ∗) such that E(T ♭) ≤ ε2/3, which
contradicts the deﬁnition of T∗. Therefore we must have T∗ = T ∗. By using Lemma 3.1 with
T = T ∗ again, we see that

and

as well as

sup

ξ∈Rhξi(cid:16)|α(t, ξ)| + |β(t, ξ)|(cid:17) ≤ Kε

for t ∈ [0, T ∗) and ε ≤ ε1. In particular we have

sup

(t,ξ)∈[0,T ∗)×Rhξi(cid:16)|α(t, ξ)| + |β(t, ξ)|(cid:17) ≤ C ♭ε

for ε ≤ ε1 with some C ♭ > 0. Next we assume T ∗ < ∞. Then, by setting ε3 =

for ε ≤ ε3. By Lemma 4.1, there exists τ ∗ > 0 such that (1.5)–(1.6) admits a unique pair of
solutions u, v ∈ C([0, T ∗ +τ ∗); H 2∩H 1,1). This contradicts the deﬁnition of T ∗, which means
T ∗ = ∞ for ε ∈ (0, ε3]. This completes the proof of the global existence part of Theorem
1.1. We also conclude that the estimates (3.2) and (3.3) are valid for (t, ξ) ∈ [0,∞) × R.
Next we turn our attentions to the asymptotic behavior. For given δ > 0, we set γ =
min{δ, 1/5} ∈ (0, 1/4). Recalling the argument in §3.2, we see that
i∂t(cid:16)α(t, ξ) − A1,1(t, ξ)(cid:17) = A1,2(t, ξ) + R1(t, ξ)
|R1(t, ξ)| ≤
hξi3t1/2 ,
for t ≥ 1, ξ ∈ R. These estimates allow us to deﬁne α+ ∈ L2 ∩ L∞ by

m α+. Then, because of the relation

α(t, ξ) − A1,1(t, ξ) = α(1, ξ) − A1,1(1, ξ) − iZ t

we have

kA1,2(t′) + R1(t′)kL2∩L∞dt′ ≤ Cε2t−1/4+γ.

Combining the result obtained above and using Lemma 2.1, we have

ku(t) − Um(t)u+kL2 = kFmUm(t)−1u(t) − Fmu+kL2

for t ≥ 1. Similarly, we can specify the large-time behavior of v(t, x) with the aid of the
asymptotics for β(t, ξ).

5. Concerning Theorem 1.2

In this section, we give an outline of the proof of Theorem 1.2. The argument is almost

parallel to that for Theorem 1.1. So we only point out two main diﬀerences.

(1): Since the nonlinear term of the ﬁrst equation in (1.4) is not the divergence form,

we need a modiﬁcation to get the estimate for kJmukL2. If µ 6= 2m, it holds that

u2∂xv =

∂x(u2v) +

µ

µ − 2m

Therefore we can show that

2mµ

it(µ − 2m)(cid:18)u(Jmu)v − u2Jµv(cid:19).
u2v(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)L2≤ Cε(1 + t)γ/3.

Jmu −

2iκµt
µ − 2m

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

(2): The reduced equation satisﬁed by α becomes

i∂tα(t, ξ) =

with

ω3 =

m(µ − 3m)
2(µ − 2m)

.

So, if µ 6= 3m and µ 6= 2m, we can obtain the desired pointwise bound for α(t, ξ) by
taking the oscillating factor into account.

Remark 5.1. In the case of µ = 2m, both of the good things mentioned above are missing,
and we have no idea how to treat this case.

Remark 5.2. The case µ = 3m is covered by the previous work [20], if we put the additional
restrictions

(5.1)

Re(κλ) < 0

and

Im(κλ) = 0

(cf. the condition (b0) in [20]). To see where these restrictions come from, let us focus on
the reduced system satisﬁed by (α, β). In the case of µ = 3m, the argument analogous to
§ 3.2 yields

∂tα =

α2β + r1,

∂tβ =

µξκ

t

3mξλ

t

α3 + r2,

DNLS SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLE MASSES

15

where r1, r2 are suitable harmless terms. Under (5.1), we can choose c > 0 such that
λ = −cκ. With this c, we have

∂t(cid:16)c|α|2 + |β|2(cid:17) = 2 Re(cid:16)cα∂tα + β∂tβ(cid:17)

2cµξ

=

t

Re(cid:16)κα3β − κα3β(cid:17) + (harmless terms)

= 0 + (harmless terms).

This allows us to obtain the a priori estimate, and thus the small data global existence.
However, the asymptotic proﬁle of the solution cannot be speciﬁed in this case. This point
should be contrasted with the non-resonance case.

6. A generalization

In this section, we give a generalization of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 to the N-component
N = {1, . . . , N, N + 1, . . . , 2N}. For z =

system (1.1). We set IN = {1, . . . , N} and I ♯
(zj)j∈IN ∈ CN , we write

z♯ = (z♯

k)k∈I ♯

N

:= (z1, . . . , zN , z1, . . . , zN ) ∈ C2N .

Then general cubic nonlinear term F = (Fj)j∈IN can be written as

Fj(u, ∂xu) =

Xl1,l2,l3=0 Xk1,k2,k3∈I ♯

N

C l1,l2,l3
j,k1,k2,k3(∂l1

x u♯

k1)(∂l2

x u♯

k2)(∂l3

x u♯

k3)

with suitable C l1,l2,l3

j,k1,k2,k3 ∈ C. We also introduce the following notation:

˜mk =( mk
−m(k−N )

(k = 1, . . . , N),

(k = N + 1, . . . , 2N).

The following theorem is a natural generalization of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.
Theorem 6.1. Assume that the following (i) and (ii) are satisﬁed for all j ∈ IN and
k1, k2, k3 ∈ I ♯
N :
(i) C 0,0,0
(ii) ˜mk1 + ˜mk2 + ˜mk3 ∈ {0, mj} implies C l1,l2,l3

j,k1,k2,k3 = 0 for l1, l2, l3 = 0, 1.

j,k1,k2,k3 = 0.

Let ϕ = (ϕj)j∈IN ∈ H 3 ∩ H 2,1, and suppose that kϕkH 3 + kϕkH 2,1 is suﬃciently small. Then
(1.1) admits a unique global solution u = (uj)j∈IN ∈ C([0,∞); H 3 ∩ H 2,1). Moreover, for
each j ∈ IN , there exists ϕ+

j ∈ L2(Rx) with ˆϕ+

j ∈ L∞(Rξ) such that
in L2(Rx)

where

where

αj(t, ξ) = FmjhUmj (t)−1uj(t,·)i(ξ).

To control the L2-norm of Jmj uj, we use the following algebraic lemma:
Lemma 6.1. If µ1 + µ2 + µ3 6= 0, we have

f1f2∂xf3 =

µ3

µ1 + µ2 + µ3

∂x(cid:16)f1f2f3(cid:17) +

R

it(µ1 + µ2 + µ3)

,

R = µ2µ3f1(cid:16)f2Jµ3f3 − (Jµ2f2)f3(cid:17) + µ1µ3f2(cid:16)f1Jµ3f3 − (Jµ1f1)f3(cid:17).

By virtue of this lemma, we can choose a suitable cubic term Γj such that kJmj uj(t) −
Γj(t)kL2 is dominated by Cε(1 + t)γ/3 under the assumption E(T ) ≤ ε2/3. To obtain the
pointwise estimate for αj(t, ξ), we derive the reduced equation including the oscillating factor
t eiωtξ2 with
ξ

16

C. LI AND H. SUNAGAWA

Remark 6.1. The assumption (i) says that each Fj contains at least one derivative of the un-
x u♯
knowns. The assumption (ii) means that the cubic interaction of the form (∂l1
k2)(∂l3
is permitted in the j-th equation only if ˜mk1 + ˜mk2 + ˜mk3 6∈ {0, mj}. Note that the assumptions
µ 6= 3m and µ 6= 2m in Theorem 1.2 can be read as

k1)(∂l2

x u♯

x u♯

k3)

(−m) + (−m) + µ 6∈ {0, m} and m + m + m 6∈ {0, µ}.

Finally, let us give a sketch of the proof of Theorem 6.1. The main step of the proof is to

get the a priori estimate for

E(T ) = sup

0≤t<T Xj∈IN(cid:20)(1 + t)− γ

3(cid:16)kuj(t)kH 3 + kJmj uj(t)kH 2(cid:17) + sup

ω =

m2
j

2 (cid:18) 1
mj −

1

˜mk1 + ˜mk2 + ˜mk3(cid:19) ∈ R\{0}.

This enables us to get an a priori bound for αj(t, ξ). The other parts of the proof are
essentially the same as those for Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, so we omit the detail.
