ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present a new method to select the faint, background galaxies used
to derive the mass of galaxy clusters by weak lensing. The method is based on the
simultaneous analysis of the shear signal, that should be consistent with zero for the
foreground, unlensed galaxies, and of the colors of the galaxies: photometric data from
the COSMic evOlution Survey are used to train the color selection. In order to validate
this methodology, we test it against a set of state-of-the-art image simulations of mock
galaxy clusters in diﬀerent redshift [0.23 −0.45] and mass [0.5 −1.55 ×1015M⊙] ranges,
mimicking medium-deep multicolor imaging observations (e.g. SUBARU, LBT).
The performance of our method in terms of contamination by unlensed sources is
comparable to a selection based on photometric redshifts, which however requires
a good spectral coverage and is thus much more observationally demanding. The
application of our method to simulations gives an average ratio between estimated
and true masses of ∼ 0.98 ± 0.09.
As a further test, we ﬁnally apply our method to real data, and compare our results
with other weak lensing mass estimates in the literature: for this purpose we choose
the cluster Abell 2219 (z = 0.228), for which multi-band (BVRi) data are publicly
available.

INTRODUCTION

Being the largest gravitationally bound structures in the
Universe, galaxy clusters are the most powerful gravitational
lenses on the sky. Their lensing signal is often detectable up
to a few Mpc from the cluster center. While strong lens-
ing events such as multiple images of distant galaxies and
gravitational arcs occur in the cluster cores, at larger radii
lensing by clusters appears in the so-called weak-lensing
regime. In this case, the lensing induced distortions of the
galaxy shapes are tiny and the lensing signal is detectable
only by averaging over ensembles of a suﬃcient number of
lensed galaxies. The measurement of their coherent distor-
tions can be used to constrain the gravitational potential

⋆ Based on data collected at the following facilities: Subaru Tele-
scope (University of Tokyo) and obtained from the SMOKA
(Baba et al. 2002), which is operated by the Astronomy Data
Center, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan; the Large
Binocular Telescope, an international collaboration among insti-
tutions in the United States, Italy and Germany.

of the cluster and therefore to map its mass distribution
(Bartelmann & Schneider 2001).
Gravitational lensing oﬀers several advantages compared to
other methods to measure cluster masses. Indeed obser-
vations of the X-ray emission by the cluster intra-cluster-
medium or the kinematics of the cluster galaxies can be
used to measure masses only under the assumption of some
sort of equilibrium between the baryons and the cluster
gravitational potential. On the other end, there are sev-
eral possible sources of biases in the weak lensing mass
estimates due to residual
instrumental distortions, dilu-
tion, wrong assumptions on the source redshift distribu-
tion, large-scale-structure and halo triaxiality which should
be properly taken into account in the analysis (Hoekstra
2003; Corless & King 2007; von der Linden et al. 2014;
Hoekstra et al. 2011; Giocoli et al. 2014; Hoekstra et al.
2015; Sereno et al. 2015).
Image simulations probed to be very helpful for under-
standing some of the limitations of the lensing analysis and
for quantifying and possibly reduce these biases. The weak

2

I. Formicola et al.

lensing community has been involved in a series of large
simulation-based challenges to identify the best perform-
ing algorithms for shear measurements (Erben et al. 2001;
Heymans et al. 2006; Massey et al. 2007; Bridle et al. 2010;
Kitching et al. 2012). Despite the fact that none of these
experiments addressed the issue of shear measurability in
regimes of relatively large shear signal (such as around clus-
ters), these simulations resulted to be extremely useful to
quantify measurement biases and to calibrate the methods.
Meneghetti et al. (2010) used the image simulation software
SkyLens (Meneghetti et al. 2008) to mimic SUBARU and
HST observations of a set of mock galaxy clusters. These
simulated observations were then processed with a Kaiser-
Squires-Broadhurst (KSB) weak lensing pipeline to measure
the ellipticities of background galaxies (Kaiser et al. 1995;
Luppino & Kaiser 1997; Hoekstra et al. 1998). Comparing
diﬀerent techniques to convert the shear measurements into
mass estimates, it was possible to quantify the scatter in-
duced by triaxiality and substructure. In a subsequent work,
Rasia et al. (2012) used analogous image simulations to in-
vestigate the dependence of accurate mass measurements on
the cluster environment.
In this paper, we speciﬁcally address the issue of the correct
identiﬁcation of background galaxies for the weak lensing
analysis. Unlensed sources in the sample used for the shape
measurement cause the dilution of the lensing signal which
is stronger at small radii due to the higher number density of
cluster galaxies, leading to underestimate the cluster mass.
Several approaches have been proposed to achieve this goal,
which generally employ multi-band photometry. When pho-
tometric data are available in only two bands, the se-
lection of background sources is generally done by iden-
tifying the galaxies redder than the cluster red-sequence
(Broadhurst et al. 2005). A suitable color cut has to be
applied in order to avoid the contamination by faint red
cluster galaxies which can result from dust reddening, in-
trinsic scatter in galaxy colors and measurement errors
(Okabe et al. 2013). However, the number density of back-
ground galaxies obtained by such selection could not al-
low us to reach the accuracy in the statistical analysis re-
quired by the weak lensing analysis of galaxy clusters. Galax-
ies bluer than the cluster red-sequence, chosen by prop-
erly deﬁning a color oﬀset, can also be included as back-
ground galaxies but are highly contaminated by foreground
cluster members (Medezinski et al. 2010; Huang et al. 2011;
Okabe et al. 2013). If more than two bands are available,
a more careful selection can be attempted by identify-
ing the regions of the color-color (CC hereafter) diagrams
populated by background galaxies (Medezinski et al. 2010;
Umetsu et al. 2010, 2012; Medezinski et al. 2013).
Here, we propose a novel approach which optimises the se-
lection of lensed background sources by employing the pho-
tometry of galaxies in the COSMic evOlution Survey (COS-
MOS). The colors of the COSMOS galaxies are used as train-
ing set for the separation of background/foreground galaxies
in the images of the galaxy clusters under study. The method
is based on the assumption that the galaxies in the COS-
MOS data-set (Ilbert et al. 2009) are representative of the
colors and of the redshift distribution of the global galaxy
population in the universe and that they allow us to charac-
terize the distribution in the CC space of galaxies in diﬀerent
redshift ranges. Simultaneously, we tune the color cuts on

the basis of the amplitude of the shear signal of the back-
ground selected galaxies. We use simulations made with the
SkyLens software to validate this method assuming diﬀer-
ent color information and diﬀerent lens masses and redshifts.
We also made comparison with others approach, such as the
selections based on the identiﬁcation of the cluster red se-
quence and on photometric redshifts. Finally, for each se-
lection method we derive an estimate of the cluster mass,
which we compare to the true mass of the simulated clus-
ter. While testing the performance of the selection method,
we also process the simulated data as done for real obser-
vations, including the process of measuring the shear from
the galaxy images. This serves as a further validation test
for the weak-lensing analysis pipeline that we recently used
in Radovich et al. (2015).
To test our approach on real observations, we apply our
method to the galaxy cluster Abell 2219, for which medium-
deep SUBARU and LBT archival observations in the BVRi
bands are available. Abell 2219 is a very well known clus-
ter for which several
independent weak lensing analyses
have been published (Bardeau et al. 2007; Hoekstra 2007;
Okabe et al. 2010).
The paper is structured as follows: in Sect. 2, we describe
the image simulations used to validate the method. The code
used to derive the galaxy ellipticities is described in Sect. 3.
The selection method developed is outlined in Sect. 4 and
compared with the method proposed by Medezinski et al.
(2010). In Sect. 5, we describe the application of the selection
method to simulated clusters using diﬀerent combinations of
photometric bands, cluster redshift and mass. In Sect. 5.2,
we quantify the contamination of the selections, and in Sect.
5.4, we discuss how well the weak lensing masses reproduce
the true masses of the simulated galaxy clusters. In the sec-
ond part of the paper, we show the analysis of Abell 2219
(Sect. 6). More precisely, we give an overview of the prop-
erties of Abell 2219 and of the previous lensing analyses of
this cluster. Sect. 6.3 describes our data reduction. Sect. 6.4
outlines the selection of the background galaxies and the
derivation of the cluster mass, which is subsequently com-
pared to previous results in the literature. Finally, we sum-
marize our conclusions in Sect. 7. Throughout this paper,
we assume a ΛCDM cosmology with ΩΛ = 0.7, ΩM = 0.3,
H0 = 70 km s−1Mpc−1.

2 LENSING SIMULATIONS

image

To test and validate the selection method, we use
realistic
simulations produced with SkyLens
(Meneghetti et al. 2008, 2010; Rasia et al. 2012). The code
uses real galaxies taken from the Hubble Ultra-Deep-Field
to create mock observations of patches of the sky with
virtually any telescope. Being coupled with a ray-tracing
code, it allows us to include the lensing eﬀects from any
mass distribution along the line of sight. As shown in
Meneghetti et al. (2010) and in Rasia et al. (2012),
it is
particularly suitable to simulate weak and strong lensing
eﬀects by galaxy clusters.
The mock galaxy clusters used here are generated with
the code MOKA (Giocoli et al. 2012). The cluster mass
distributions have multiple components, namely a triaxial
halo, modelled with a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) proﬁle

(Navarro et al. 1997), substructures described by truncated
Singular
(Metcalf & Madau 2001),
and a brightest central galaxy (BCG) modelled with an
Hernquist density proﬁle (Hernquist 1990). More details
about MOKA can be found in Giocoli et al. (2012).
To evaluate the performance of the selection algorithm we
need to populate the ﬁeld-of-view around a mock galaxy
cluster with cluster members, foreground and background
galaxies. Most importantly, galaxy colors have to be as
much realistic as possible. MOKA populates the dark
matter sub-haloes using the Halo Occupation Distribution
(HOD) technique. Stellar masses and B-band luminosities
are assigned to each galaxy accordingly to the mass of
the dark matter (sub-)halo within which it formed, fol-
lowing Wang et al. (2006). The morphological type and
the spectral energy distribution (SED) are deﬁned on
the basis of the stellar mass and such to reproduce ob-
served morphology-density and morphology-radius relations
(van der Wel 2008). We veriﬁed that colors reproduce the
expected red-sequences for clusters over a large range of
redshifts.
The photometry of foreground and background galaxies is
computed starting from the best-ﬁtting SEDs determined
by Coe et al. (2006) for the HUDF, and convolving them
with ﬁlter transmission.
The redshift distribution of the input sources also matches
that of the HUDF. Given the exposure times and the
observational set-up used in our simulations, the median
redshift is zm ∼ 1. All simulations in this work have a FOV
of 30′ × 30′. For simplicity, we adopt a spatially constant
gaussian PSF with FWHM 0.6′′.
We produced several sets of images with diﬀerent cluster
mass and redshift, and combination of ﬁlters which we
analyze in Sect 5.
One set of simulations mimics the archival Subaru and LBT
observations available for Abell 2219 which is analyzed in
the second part of the paper. More precisely, we simulate
images in the BVRi bands with exposure times as listed in
Table 4. We reproduce the telescope throughputs, accord-
ing to informations retrieved from the Subaru and LBT
telescope websites. In this case, the cluster simulated with
MOKA has the same redshift of Abell 2219 and its virial
mass is chosen to be 1 × 1015M⊙, consistent with previous
mass measurements found in the literature for this cluster.
We assume a concentration of 3.8, consistent with values
expected for clusters of this mass on the basis of recent
concentration-mass
2014).
Using this set of simulations, we explore the eﬀect of several
selection techniques on the mass reconstruction, based on
diﬀerent ﬁlter combinations. Hereafter, the analysis of this
dataset with our selection method is coded with case 1 and
case 2 if the photometry in BVR and BVRi bands is used
respectively, while analyses of this dataset with alternative
selection methods are coded with case 1-2.
Then we investigate how the method works under diﬀerent
cluster redshifts. In this case, we mimic Subaru Suprime-
Cam observations in the gri bands. Here we consider the
case Mvir = 1.55 × 1015M⊙, cvir = 3.8, and three cluster
redshifts: zl = 0.23, 0.35, 0.45 which are coded as cases 3,4
and 5, respectively.
Finally, we investigate the mass dependence on the selection
method. In this case we simulate Subaru Suprime-Cam

simulations with photometry in gri bands have an exposure
time in the g and i bands of 1800s while we double it in
the r band, which is used for the shear measurement. The
setups of the simulations are listed in Table 1.
We derive the multiband photometry running SExtractor
in dual-mode, with the R or r band images used as
detection images. In the next section, we describe the shear
measurement on these images that closely resembles that
applied to the data analysis of A2219.

3 SHEAR MEASUREMENTS

The observed shear signal produced by the gravitational
ﬁeld of the clusters is measured using the KSB approach
(Kaiser et al. 1995; Luppino & Kaiser 1997; Hoekstra et al.
1998). This method uses stars to remove from galaxy el-
lipticities the PSF contribute due to the atmosphere and
the telescope optics, giving a shear estimator uncontami-
nated by systematics. These distortions can be taken into
account considering the PSF as made of two components:
one isotropic, which smears images mimicking the eﬀect in-
troduced by seeing, and one anisotropic (due to guiding er-
rors, coaddition, optics, bad focusing etc.) that introduces
anisotropic distortions which mimic a lensing signal. The
eﬀect of the PSF anisotropy depends on the galaxy size
and is stronger for the smallest sources. In the formalism
described below, source ellipticity is a complex (two com-
ponents) quantity. The correction of the observed ellipticity
eobs for the anisotropic component, as prescribed by the KSB
method, is given by:

eaniso = eobs − P smp,

p = e∗

obsP sm∗−1

,

(1)

(2)

where p measures the PSF anisotropy and P sm is the smear
polarizability tensor given in Hoekstra et al. (1998). The
tensor p can be estimated from images of stellar objects
(the quantities with ∗ symbol are computed on stars). The
relation between the intrinsic ellipticity e of a galaxy and
the reduced shear g = γ/(1 − κ) will be:
eaniso = e + P γg,

(3)

where the tensor P γ, called the pre-seeing shear polarizabil-
ity tensor (Luppino & Kaiser 1997), describes the eﬀect of
seeing. P γ has the following expression:

P γ = P sh − P smP sh∗P sm∗−1 = P sh − P smq,

We
Radovich et al. (2015). The main feature of our pipeline
is that the PSF is modelled as a polynomial function of
the position, evaluated with the PSFex software (Bertin
2011), which extracts models of the PSF from the image.
The p and q terms are derived at each galaxy’s position
using this PSF model. For each galaxy, the output quantity
eiso = eanisoP γ −1 is computed and used to derive the aver-
age reduced shear, being hgi = heisoi under the assumption
that the contribution of the intrinsic ellipticities vanishes
when averaging over a large number of galaxies.
The main quantities described by the KSB approach are
weighted through a gaussian window function of scale
length θ to beat down the noise. The size of the window
function has a crucial role since, if it is not properly chosen,
noise will bias the ellipticity measurements. We ﬁnd the
size of the window function that maximizes the ellipticity
signal-to-noise ratio (Eq. 5), deﬁned by the Eq. 16 in
Erben et al. (2001):

SN e(θ) = R I(θ)W (|θ|)d2θ
σskyqR W 2(|θ|)d2θ

;

(5)

as described by Huang et al. (2011).
Hoekstra et al. (1998) ﬁrst pointed out that quantities from
stellar objects should be calculated with the same scale as
the object to be corrected. This is done in our implemen-
tation of the KSB analysis. The selection of stars used to
correct the distortions introduced by the PSF components
is made in the magnitude MAG AUTO 1 vs. δ = MU MAX
-MAG AUTO space, where MU MAX is the SExtractor pa-
rameter indicating the peak surface brightness above the
background. The quantity δ is used as the estimator of the
object size to separate stars from galaxies. When we ana-
lyze simulations, we use stars with r or R magnitudes in the
range [15, 19] to correct for the eﬀects introduced by PSF
anisotropy and seeing.
The tangential and the cross components of the reduced
shear, gT and g×, are obtained from the quantities e1iso and
e2iso used, respectively, as g1 and g2 in Eq. 6 and Eq. 7:

gT (i) = −g1(i) cos 2ϕ − g2(i) sin 2ϕ;

g×(i) = −g1(i) sin 2ϕ + g2(i) cos 2ϕ.

(6)

(7)

Here (i) indicates the i-th galaxy and ϕ the position angle
determined assuming the position of the BCG as the cluster
center. The radial proﬁles are obtained by averaging both
shear components in annuli centered on the BCG.
We exclude from the catalog galaxies with SNe < 5 (our
choice of SNe < 5 corresponds to roughly SNR < 10, if we
use the deﬁnition SNR = FLUX AUTO/FLUXERR AUTO,
where FLUX AUTO and FLUXERR AUTO are SExtractor
quantities) and galaxies with corrected ellipticities e1iso > 1
or e2iso > 1, for which the ellipticity measurement is not
meaningful. The performances of our KSB code are exten-
sively discussed in Radovich et al. (2015). In addition, in

the appendix we give an estimate of the bias in the shear
measurement using the set of simulations tailored on obser-
vations of Abell 2219 as described in the Sect. 2. We ﬁnd
that our KSB pipeline on average underestimates the mea-
sured shear by about 5% with respect to the input values.
Therefore we apply a calibration factor of 1.05 to the mea-
sured ellipticities and use the corrected ellipticities to derive
cluster masses.

4 SELECTION OF THE BACKGROUND

SAMPLE

In this section, we describe the technique that we developed
for the selection in CC space assuming that observations in
at least three bands can be used.
Medezinski et al. (2010) did an extensive work on the usage
of colors to identify the background galaxies for the weak
lensing analysis. Using SUBARU Suprime-Cam observations
of the three clusters A1703 (z = 0.258), A370 (z = 0.375),
RXJ 1347-11 (z = 0.451), they derive the CC diagrams of
the galaxies in these ﬁelds. More precisely, they used r -i vs
g-r (A1703); R-z vs B -R (A370) and R-z vs V -R (RXJ
1347-11).
In Medezinski et al. (2010) (Fig. 1) the cluster member pop-
ulation is identiﬁed in CC space adding the information on
the mean distance of all objects from the cluster center in a
given cell of the CC diagram. The region in the CC space,
where the mean distance is lower, corresponds to an over-
density of galaxies comprising the cluster red sequence and
blue later type cluster members. The identiﬁcation of fore-
ground and background populations is done looking at the
galaxy overdensities in CC space and at the corresponding
weak lensing signal. In particular, CC diagrams (Fig. 2 in
Medezinski et al. (2010)) appear to be characterized by a
clump of red objects with a rising weak lensing signal at
small radii corresponding to background sources in the red-
shift range 0.5 < z < 2. This clump is located in the lower
right side of the CC diagrams. Two others clumps lying blue-
ward of the cluster in CC space are populated by blue ob-
jects. The redder one is located near the center of the CC
diagrams and is populated by foreground unlensed sources
since they show a little weak lensing signal and no clustering
near the cluster center in their spatial distribution. Galax-
ies belonging to the bluer clump are also unclustered near
to the cluster center and have a weak lensing signal similar
to that of the red background galaxies indicating that these
blue objects are background galaxies in the redshift range
1 < z < 2.5. This clump is located in the left side of the CC
diagrams.
Here we propose a variation of the method adopted by
Medezinski et al. (2010). More precisely, we introduce two
novelties in the selection process, namely:

(i) we use the galaxies in the COSMOS, including their
colors and photometric redshifts, to identify the regions of
the CC diagrams populated by the galaxies at redshift higher
than the cluster. COSMOS colors are used as a training
set for the separation of background/foreground galaxies
in the images of the galaxy clusters under study. We use
the COSMOS photometric redshift catalog of Ilbert et al.
(2009). The redshift measurements are based on the photom-
etry in 30 broad, intermediate and narrow bands spanning

Selecting background galaxies in cluster weak-lensing analyses

a range of wavelengths from the UV to the mid-IR. Based
on a subsample of spectroscopically conﬁrmed sources, the
accuracy of the photo-zs at magnitudes i +
AB < 24 and red-
shifts z < 1.25 is σ∆z/(1+zs) = 0.012, where ∆z = zs − zp
is the diﬀerence between the spectroscopic and the photo-
metric redshifts. Photo-zs up to z ∼ 2 are less accurate:
σ∆z/(1+zs) = 0.06 at i +
AB ∼ 24. The source redshift dis-
tribution is characterized by median redshifts zm = 0.66
and zm = 1.06 for sources in the magnitude ranges 22

AB < 22.5 and 24.5 < i+
(ii) A ﬁne-tuning in the selection of background galaxies
is done by maximizing the amplitude of the shear proﬁle, in
particular in the inner radial bins, where the dilution of the
shear by cluster members is higher.

AB < 25, respectively.

The implementation of our method is based on the following
steps:

(i) We determine on the COSMOS (col1, col2) CC plane
the line (a · col1 + col2 + c = 0) separating background and
foreground galaxies at the cluster’s redshift. This line is de-
ﬁned as the tangent to the ellipse ﬁtting the 20% density
contour in the foreground galaxies’ CC distribution, parallel
to the ellipse major axis.

(ii) For each i-galaxy observed in the cluster ﬁeld with

colors col1i, col2i, we compute its distance from this line:

di =

a · col1i + col2i + c

√a2 + 1

;

(8)

and make an initial separation between foreground (di > 0)
and background(di < 0) galaxies.

(iii) In a similar way, we can deﬁne in the COSMOS CC
plane additional color cuts that allow us to improve the sepa-
ration of foreground and background galaxies at the cluster’s
redshift as detailed later in Sect. 5.

(iv) We deﬁne a threshold in magnitude below which un-
certainties in the measured ﬂuxes are too high to derive re-
liable colors, but which most likely come from background
galaxies: galaxies fainter than this threshold are included in
the background sample.

(v) We measure the shear signal (Eq. 6) from the back-
ground galaxies and ﬁne-tune the a, c coeﬃcients to maxi-
mize its amplitude. To this end, we randomly vary a around
±50% of its initial value, while we randomly vary c of ±0.2
around its initial value. Then we make a new selection of
background galaxies di(an, cn) < 0, with an and cn being
the coeﬃcient values in the n-th realization: as a result of
this iterative procedure, we select the values of a, c that max-
imize the amplitude of the shear signal in the three inner ra-
dial bins. Simultaneously, we also check that the tangential
shear proﬁle of the foreground and cluster member galaxies
is consistent with zero at all radii.

Despite the limited size of the COSMOS ﬁeld, several tests
show that using the COSMOS colors as starting point for
the identiﬁcation of distant sources is safe. For example, if
we apply the color cuts based on the COSMOS photometry
to select high redshift galaxies in the Hubble Ultra-Deep-
Field, we ﬁnd a low contamination by low redshift sources.
The method can be also applied to data observed with a
diﬀerent ﬁlter set. In the examples discussed later in this
paper, we use the software ZEBRA (Feldmann et al. 2006)
to derive the SEDs of the COSMOS galaxies and we use
them to calculate magnitudes in other ﬁlters by convolving

with the ﬁlter transmission curves.
In Sect. 5, we show the application of this approach to simu-
lated images of clusters in diﬀerent redshift and mass ranges

ies is derived and discussed in the Sect. 5.2.

5 ANALYSIS OF SIMULATED DATA

In this section, we show the results of the application of our
selection method to simulations. First, we consider diﬀerent
combinations of cluster redshifts (zl) and ﬁlters: zl = 0.23
(BV R, BV Ri, and gri; cases 1, 2, 3), zl = 0.35 (gri; case 4)
and zl = 0.45 (gri; case 5). In these cases, the mass of the
lens is Mvir = 1015M⊙ (cases 1, 2) and Mvir = 1.55×1015M⊙
(case 3, 4, 5). Cases 1, 2 are tested also against alternative
methods to identify the background galaxies. Finally, we
complement these simulations with additional two test cases,
where we keep the lens redshift ﬁxed at zl = 0.23 and assume
the lens mass to be Mvir = 0.5 × 1015 M⊙ and Mvir =
0.75 × 1015 M⊙ (cases 6 and 7). The ﬁlter combination used
in these last two cases is the same used in the test case 3.

5.1 Selection process

As outlined above,
in all these scenarios, we start by
deriving the CC diagrams of the COSMOS galaxies for
the corresponding ﬁlter combinations. As an example, Fig.
1 shows the r -i vs g-r diagram of the COSMOS galaxies
and the foreground/background galaxy separation in the
case of a cluster at redshift zl = 0.45 (case 5). Galaxies
with photo-zs > 0.47 are plotted in red, while those with
photo-zs 6 0.47 are plotted in yellow. A margin of 0.02
in redshift is used to account for photo-z accuracy when
we select galaxies at a redshift higher than the cluster
redshift. Density contours of background and foreground
galaxies are shown in blue and in green respectively. Also
displayed is the ellipse ﬁtting the 20% foreground contour;
the dot-dashed line is the tangent to this ellipse. Fig. 2
summarizes the full procedure. The dot-dashed lines in
the left panels correspond to the initial values of the a, c
coeﬃcients, derived for all the test cases here considered.
Obviously, the results depend on the ﬁlter combination and
on the lens redshift. The coeﬃcients a and c obtained for
test cases 1-5 are listed in the Table 2. Test cases 6-7 are
omitted because the results are identical to test case 3 (the
selection based on COSMOS data does not depend on the
lens mass). The second step of our procedure consists in the
ﬁne-tuning of the selection based on the amplitude of the
shear proﬁle derived from the galaxies which are classiﬁed
as background sources. Therefore, we consider now the CC
diagrams built using all galaxies in the simulated cluster
ﬁelds. We start by identifying the background sources based
on the lines derived in the ﬁrst step. For each galaxy, we
compute the distance di from these lines and looking at
the amplitude of the shear proﬁle of sources with di < 0
we derive new coeﬃcients (a, c) as explained in the Sect.
4. The adjusted lines separating the background from the
foreground and cluster galaxies are given for the test cases
1-5 by the dashed lines in the left panels of Fig. 2. The
lines derived from the COSMOS data are also shown for

I. Formicola et al.

(ii) di < 0, 21 < R 6 26 mag;
(iii) di > 0, V -R < 0.1 and 21 < R < 24.2 mag.

The foreground and the cluster galaxies are separated as
follows:

V -R < 0.35 and R < 24.2 mag;

• foreground galaxies: di > 0, 0.7 6 B -R < 1.3, 0.12 6
• cluster galaxies: di > 0, 0.2 < V -R < 0.6, 1.3 6 B -R

< 2.2 and R < 24.2 mag.

If the selection is performed in the color space R-i vs B -V,
the criteria (i) and (ii) above obviously remain valid. In this
case, the background sample is composed by galaxies sat-
isfying the criteria (i) and (ii) and by those satisfying the
following conditions: di > 0, R-i < 0.03 and 21 < R < 24.2
mag.
In addition, we identify the foreground and the cluster galax-
ies as follows:

< 24.2 mag.

• foreground galaxies: di > 0, 0.03 6 R-i < 0.16 and R
• cluster galaxies: di > 0, 0.16 6 R-i < 1.1 and R < 24.2.
cases 3, 6, 7: in these cases, the cluster redshift is zl =
0.23 and the ﬁlter combination is gri. However, the cluster
mass is diﬀerent. The selection is performed in color space
col1 =r -i and col2 =g-r. In the test case 3, the background
sources are selected following the criteria:

• di > 0, 25 6 r 6 26 mag;
• di < 0, 22 < r 6 26 mag;
• di > 0, 22 < r < 25 mag, g-r > 1.7.

The foreground galaxies and the cluster members are instead
identiﬁed as follows:

mag;

• foreground galaxies: di > 0, 0.1 < g-r < 0.5, r < 24.5
• cluster galaxies: di > 0, 0.5 6 g-r 6 1.5, r < 24.5 mag.
We ﬁnd that these criteria change very little when consid-
ering the test cases 6 and 7.
case 4: in the case of this cluster at zl = 0.35, the criteria
to identify the background galaxies are very similar to those
found for the test case 3. Indeed, the ﬁlter combination is
identical and the selection must be modiﬁed only accounting
for the shift of the cluster galaxies in the CC diagram. The
optimal criteria for identifying the background galaxies are:

• di > 0, 25 6 r 6 26 mag;
• di < 0, 22 < r 6 26 mag;
• di > 0, 22 < r < 25 mag, g-r > 1.8.

The foreground and cluster galaxies are instead selected

based on the conditions:

mag;

• foreground galaxies: di > 0, 0.1 < g-r < 0.65, r < 24.5
• cluster galaxies: di > 0, 0.65 6 g-r 6 1.78, r < 24.5

mag.

simulated data: for the test case 5, outlined in Sect. 5.1, we show
the CC diagram of COSMOS galaxies and the identiﬁcation of
background galaxies based on the photometric redshift estimates

than the cluster redshift (zl = 0.45) are indicated by red and
yellow dots, respectively (the corresponding number density con-
tours are given by the blue and green solid lines).

comparison (dot-dashed lines). The optimized coeﬃcients
after the ﬁne tuning with the shear signal are listed in
the Table 2. Given that ﬁne tuning is done on the CC
diagrams, which also include the cluster galaxies, being the
lens diﬀerent, the lines optimized for the test cases 6 and 7
diﬀer slightly from that derived for the test case 3.
The ﬁnal results of the selection process are shown in the
left panels of Fig. 2 for the test cases 1-5, where background,
foreground, and cluster galaxies are shown in magenta,
green, and orange, respectively. The detailed classiﬁcation
of the sources in the CC diagrams corresponding to each of
the test cases is given below.

cases 1, 2: when using the colors col1 =V -R and col2 =B -
R to separate background, cluster and foreground galaxies,
we ﬁnd that the selection which maximizes the amplitude
of the tangential reduced shear proﬁle is obtained using the
following criteria for the background galaxies:

case 5: ﬁnally, in the case of the cluster at the highest red-
shift among those we have considered (zl = 0.45), operating
in the same color space of cases 3-4, we optimize the identiﬁ-
cation of the galaxies in the cluster background by applying
the following color and magnitude cuts:

(i) di > 0, 24.2 6 R 6 26 mag;

• di > 0, 25 6 r 6 26 mag;

give a lengthy description in Sect. 5.1. The left panels show the identiﬁcation of background (magenta), foreground (green), and cluster
galaxies (orange) in color space. Unclassiﬁed galaxies are indicated by black dots. The dot-dashed lines in the left panels correspond to
the initial separation between foreground and background galaxies based on COSMOS data. Dashed lines correspond to this separation
after the ﬁne-tuning with the shear signal. In the middle panels, we show the radial number density proﬁles of background, foreground,
and cluster galaxies. The results for the three galaxy sub-samples are shown using the same color-coding as in the left panels. The right
panels show the corresponding radial proﬁles of the tangential (gT ) and cross components (g×) of the reduced shear.

I. Formicola et al.

• di < 0, 22 < r 6 26 mag;
• di > 0, 22 < r < 25 mag, g-r > 1.85.

Again, we distinguish between cluster members and fore-
ground galaxies:

mag;

• foreground galaxies: di > 0, 0.1 < g-r < 0.7, r < 24.5
• cluster member galaxies: di > 0, 0.7 6 g-r 6 1.82, r

< 24.5 mag.

In all cases, for a fraction of galaxies, the identiﬁcation is
uncertain. In Fig. 2, background galaxies that are located
too close to foreground galaxies in the CC diagrams, are
marked as black dots. The radial proﬁles of the galaxy num-
ber densities and of the tangential and cross components of
the reduced shear, measured in each of the three sub-samples
of background, foreground, and cluster galaxies, are shown
in the middle and right panels of Fig. 2. Again, we use the
magenta, green, and orange colors to distinguish between
the three classes of sources.
As expected, in all cases we notice that the number density
of background galaxies drops at small radii. The decrement
of number counts is in large part due to magniﬁcation, which
becomes stronger when approaching the cluster critical lines
(Broadhurst et al. 2008). In addition, a fraction of sources
at the smallest distances from the cluster center remains
hidden behind the brightest cluster members.
On the contrary, at least in the test cases 3, 4 and 5, the
number density proﬁles of the cluster members have the op-
posite trend, rising towards the center of the cluster. This is
less evident in the test cases 1 and 2, corresponding to the
lowest cluster redshift among those we have investigated. In
these cases, the proﬁles are quite ﬂat and a small increment
of galaxy counts is seen only in the innermost radial bin.
The tangential shear proﬁles of the background galaxies
nicely rise towards small radii, as expected in the case of
centrally concentrated lenses. The proﬁles of the cross com-
ponent of the shear are all consistent with zero, indicating
that the measurements are not aﬀected by systematics.
The tangential shear proﬁles of foreground and cluster galax-
ies should be consistent with zero. We ﬁnd this not to be the
case in several of the test cases. In the next section, we will
see that the origin of this behaviour is due to the contam-
inations of these two samples by background galaxies. We
want to stress that the goal of our selection method is to
obtain a sample of background galaxies with a low contam-
ination by unlensed sources, this implies to lose a fraction
of background galaxies lying in the same regions of the CC
space populated by foreground and cluster members.

5.2 Contamination

Working with simulated data, we can easily quantify how
precisely we are able to distinguish between background,
foreground, and cluster galaxies. We quantify the perfor-
mance in terms of contamination of the subsample of back-
ground galaxies by other kind of galaxies. Although identi-
fying the cluster and the foreground galaxies is not the main
goal of this analysis, we can verify also what is the level of
contamination by background galaxies in the sub-samples of
foreground and cluster galaxies.
We compute the contamination of the background sample

by foreground galaxies as:

ff or =

nf b
nb

,

(9)

where nf b is the number of galaxies with redshift zt 6 zl (zt
input redshift) identiﬁed as background galaxies and nb is
the total number of background selected galaxies.
Similarly, the contamination of the background sample by
cluster galaxies is given by

fclus =

ncb
nb

,

(10)

where ncb is the number of cluster galaxies mis-identiﬁed as
background sources.
We also deﬁne the fraction of background galaxies which are
incorrectly assigned to the foreground sample,

fbackf =

nbf
nf

,

(11)

where nbf is the number of galaxies with zt > zl mis-
identiﬁed as foreground galaxies and nf is the total num-
ber of foreground galaxies, and the fraction of background
galaxies contaminating the sub-sample of cluster galaxies,

fbackc =

nbc
nc

,

(12)

where nbc is the number of galaxies with zt > zl erroneously
assigned to the sub-sample of cluster members, which con-
tains nc galaxies.
These quantities are listed in columns 3-7 of Table 3 for the
seven test cases described above (column 5 shows the total
contamination, resulting from the both foreground and clus-
ter galaxies, ftot = ff or + fclus). Using the method that we
have developed, we ﬁnd that the contamination by cluster
galaxies is always very small, of the order of ∼ 1% in all the
test cases. Instead, the major contaminants of the sample of
background galaxies are sources in the cluster foreground.
In this case, the contamination ranges between ∼ 6% and
∼ 10%, being larger for lenses at larger redshift, as expected.
Given that the total level of contamination is always . 11%,
we can conclude that the method works well.
The level of contamination of the sub-samples of foreground
and cluster galaxies allows us to interpret some of the results
shown in Fig. 2. As noted earlier, the tangential shear proﬁle
measured from galaxies in these two sub-samples often varies
as a function of radius, while, in absence of lensing the pro-
ﬁles should be ﬂat and consistent with zero. From Table 3,
we see that a signiﬁcant number of background galaxies
are indeed mis-identiﬁed as cluster members or foreground
galaxies. The contamination of these two sub-samples varies
from ∼ 32% to ∼ 64%. The level of contamination depends
not only on the lens redshift, but also on the ﬁlter combi-
nation used to deﬁne the color space. For example, consid-
ering the test case 1, we see that the number of background
galaxies included in the samples of foreground or cluster
galaxies amounts to ∼ 63 − 64% of the total. The addi-
tion of the i-band allows us to reduce the contamination to
∼ 50%. Given that our goal is to optimize the selection of
background sources for the subsequent lensing analysis, we
consider the contamination of the sub-sample of foreground
and cluster galaxies a fair price to pay.
It is also important to note that the method produces the
same results when applied to lenses of diﬀerent masses. This
is evident comparing the results for the test cases 3, 6, and 7.

Selecting background galaxies in cluster weak-lensing analyses

9

While in Sect. 5.1, we showed that changing the mass of the
lens only weakly impacted on the choice of the coeﬃcients
a and b, we see here that the contamination of the sample
of background sources is also independent on the lens. We
have to bear in mind however that the same prescriptions
were used to populate the lenses with galaxies and to assign
them a SED.

5.3 Comparison to other selection methods

An interesting question is how the performance of the
method proposed here compares to that of other techniques
to identify lensed galaxies behind clusters. To answer this
question, we implement some of these other methods and
apply them to our simulations.
We consider here three further approaches, which we ap-
ply to the lens at zl = 0.23 used in the test cases 1 e 2
above. The ﬁrst is based on the identiﬁcation of the clus-
ter members through the location of the red-sequence in the
color-magnitude diagram (see e.g. Okabe et al. 2010). Even
in this case, some boundaries on both sides of the red se-
quence must be deﬁned in order to separate the candidate
background sources from the cluster members. This is done
again by maximizing the amplitude of the tangential shear
proﬁle derived from the sources ending up in the background
sample. Therefore we identify the cluster red sequence in the
V -R vs R color-magnitude diagram and we apply the Ok-
abe’s method.
We further consider a selection based on a simple magni-
tude cut, selecting the galaxies with 22 6 R 6 26. The idea
behind this simple method is that the faintest galaxies are
likely to be in the cluster background, while the brightest
ones are in large fraction foreground and cluster galaxies.
Finally, we consider the identiﬁcation of background sources
based on photometric redshifts. Of course, the precision of
the measurements depends on the number of bands avail-
able and on the depth of the corresponding exposures. In
order to make a fair comparison to our previous results, we
use the simulated BVRi photometric data produced for the
test cases 1 and 2. We use the ZEBRA code in Maximum-
Likelihood mode to ﬁt the source SEDs with a library of tem-
plates and derive the photometric redshifts (Feldmann et al.
2006). Given the limited number of bands used, we decide
not to include galaxies with photometric redshifts higher
than zphot = 2 and with measurement error σz/(1+z) > 0.1.
We select as background galaxies those having zphot > 0.27.
Fig. 3 shows the radial proﬁles of the galaxy number counts
(upper panel) and of the tangential and cross components
of the reduced shear (bottom panel) for the sub-samples of
background, foreground, and cluster galaxies identiﬁed us-
ing the photometric redshift technique. Comparing to the
test case 2 in Fig. 2, we notice that our conservative cuts
lead to a lower number density of background galaxies (∼ 8
gal/sq. arcmin) compared to the test case 2 (∼ 10 gal/sq.
arcmin).
The tangential shear proﬁle derived from the sub-sample of
background sources is steeper than measured in test cases 1
and 2. We also notice that the corresponding proﬁle obtained
using those galaxies classiﬁed as cluster members grows to-
wards the cluster center, leading to the suspect that this
sub-sample is contaminated by background galaxies. In the
last three rows of Table 3, we list the contamination esti-

Figure 3. Selection with photometric redshifts. Background
galaxies having zphot > 0.27 are marked with magenta squares,
cluster galaxies having 0.19 6 zphot 6 0.27 with orange trian-
gles and foreground galaxies having zphot < 0.19 with green dia-
monds. The rise towards the centre of the gT proﬁle of the cluster
member galaxies is due to the limited accuracy of the photometric
redshifts derived.

mates obtained by analyzing the simulations with the three
alternative methods outlined above. It appears that the se-
lection based on the photometric redshifts leads to a contam-
ination of the sample of background sources similar to that
found in test case 2 (the total contamination is ∼ 6%). The
contaminations of the sub-samples of foreground and cluster
galaxies are smaller using the photometric redshift selection
than found using our selection in color space (∼ 37 − 38%
vs 49 − 51%).
The methods based on magnitude cuts and on the identi-
ﬁcation of the red-sequence lead to deﬁne sub-samples of
background sources which have the highest contamination
(at the level of ∼ 10 − 13%). In these two cases, we did not
attempt to separate foreground and the cluster galaxies.

5.4 Mass estimates

As a last test based on simulations, we quantify now how
the selection of background sources impacts on the estimate
of the lens mass.
Mass estimates are obtained by ﬁtting the reduced tangen-
tial shear proﬁles. Obviously, only the sources classiﬁed as
background galaxies are used for this analysis. The ﬁtting
model is based on the NFW density proﬁle (Navarro et al.

10

I. Formicola et al.

1997):

ρ(r) =

ρs

r/rs(1 + r/rs)2 .

(13)

The model depends on two parameters, namely the scale ra-
dius rs and the characteristic density ρs. Most commonly,
the NFW proﬁle is parametrized in terms of the concentra-
tion, c = rvir/rs, and of the virial mass:

Mvir = 4πρsr3

s(cid:20)ln(1 + c) −

c

1 + c(cid:21) .

(14)

The analytic formulas describing the radial proﬁle of the
shear for such a model can be found in (Bartelmann 1996).
The ﬁt is performed minimizing the log-likelihood function
(Eq. 15 (Schneider et al. 2000)):

lγ =

Nγ

Xi=1"|ǫi − g(~θi)|2

σ2[g(~θi)]

+ 2 ln σ[g(~θi)]# ;

(15)

where ǫi are the observed ellipticities of the background
sources, g(~θi) is the reduced shear predicted by the model at
the position ~θi, and σ[g(~θi)] = (1−|g(~θi)|2)σe. The variance
of the intrinsic source ellipticity is assumed to be σe = 0.3.
The computation of the cluster mass requires to know the
critical surface density Σcr of the lens,

Σcr =

(16)

N PN

DSi (cid:17),

where DS, DL and DLS are the angular diameter distances
between the observer and the sources, between the observer
and the lens, and between the lens and the source, respec-
tively. While DL is ﬁxed for a given lens, the sources are
not all at the same redshift. They have a redshift distribu-
tion which should be accounted for. The dependence of Σcr
on the source redshift zs is contained in the function β =
DLS/DS = β(zs). We adopt the approximation of a con-
stant hβi for all galaxies. Its value, hβi = 1
is computed using the COSMOS photometric redshifts, ap-
plying to the COSMOS catalog the color and magnitude cuts
which led to the identiﬁcation of the background galaxies.
The values of hβi in all test cases are listed in Column 12 of
Table 3. We verify that the hβi value computed in this way
is equivalent to that obtained assuming that all galaxies lie
at the same mean redshift hzsi: β = DLS (hzsi)
DS (hzsi) . In Column
11 of Table 3, we summarize the measurements of the virial
masses for all the test cases considered. In all cases, the ﬁt
is performed keeping the concentration constant and equal
to the input value used to generate the lens mass distribu-
tions with MOKA (c = 3.8). Thus the ﬁt of the tangential
reduced shear proﬁles is done assuming only one free pa-
rameter, namely the virial mass. The ﬁt is performed in the
radial range of 30
. The results show that the
masses obtained from the galaxies selected in color space
diﬀer from the true masses by . 10 − 15%. On average, the
ratio between estimated and true masses is ∼ 0.98 ± 0.09,
thus consistent with no mass bias. The values of hβi based
on the COSMOS photometric redshifts are similar in all the
test cases where the lens has the same redshift (hβi ∼ 0.74).
This value is consistent with the true value obtained from
the input source redshift distribution, when truncated to
mimic the depth of the simulated observations. As expected,
hβi is smaller for lenses at higher redshift (test cases 4 and

of the plot we apply an oﬀset of 0.2 arcmin to the black squares.

5) when the depth of the observation is ﬁxed.
In Table 3, we report also the mass estimates obtained in the
three cases where we have used alternative methods to iden-
tify the background galaxies (bottom rows). The selections
based on the identiﬁcation of the cluster red sequence and on
the magnitude cuts give the highest contaminations by fore-
ground and cluster galaxies, thus resulting in masses that
under-estimate the true masses more signiﬁcantly (−17%
and −22%, respectively). When we select sources based on
photometric redshifts derived with the ZEBRA code, we ﬁnd
that the value of hβi estimated from the photometric red-
shifts themselves is smaller than the true value (hβi ∼ 0.62).
In part, this is due to the choice of using only sources with
zphot < 2. However, we notice that, for a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of galaxies, the photometric redshifts under-estimate
the true redshifts. Indeed, the median photometric redshift
of the selected sample is zphot,med = 0.86, while the median
true redshift of the same galaxies is ztrue,med = 0.99. This
results in under-estimating β. Since this appears in the de-
nominator of Eq. 16, the mass of the lens is over-estimated
by ∼ 11%.

5.5 Eﬀects of mis-centering

Finally we verify if the selection of background sources can
be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the choice of the cluster centre,
which is used to measure the tangential shear proﬁle of the
background galaxies. For this purpose, we repeat the proce-
dure by assuming a center which is oﬀ with respect to the
true center (BCG position) by ∼ 30′′. The radial density
proﬁles of background sources selected in both cases of cor-
rect and wrong identiﬁcation of the cluster center are shown
in Fig. 4. They are barely distinguishable, indicating that
the mis-centering has little eﬀect on the identiﬁcation of the
background galaxies.

Having evaluated the performance of the method on simu-
lated data, we apply our procedure to select the galaxies in
the background of Abell 2219. The choice of this cluster is

6.1 General properties

6.2 Previous weak lensing analyses

Abell 2219 is a galaxy cluster at zl = 0.228 with X-ray lu-
minosity Lx = 2 × 1045 ergs s−1 in the 0.1-2.4 keV energy
range (Ebeling et al. 1998). This makes it one of the most
luminous X-ray clusters in the northern sky. Its X-ray sur-
face brightness distribution has quite elongated structure.
The core is dominated by a massive cD galaxy.
Smail et al. (1995) reported the discovery of two systems
of giant arcs which allowed them to constrain the (dark)
matter distribution in the central region. They found that
this is not well aligned with the gas, interpreting this result
as the signature of an on-going merger event. On the basis
of other multiple images identiﬁed by Smith et al. (2005),
Richard et al. (2010) estimated a projected mass within a
radius R < 250 kpc MSL = 2.33 ± 0.23 × 1014M⊙. The Ein-
stein radius was found to be (15.6 ± 0.6) arcsec.
The study of the internal dynamics of the cluster on the ba-
sis of TNG spectroscopic data (Boschin et al. 2004) gives
a value for the line of sight velocity dispersion of σv =
1438+109
km s−1, while the mass within the virial re-
−86
gion is ∼ 2.8 × 1015h−1M⊙. On the basis of the multi-
wavelength analysis obtained using both optical and X-ray
data, Boschin et al. (2004) also suggested that the cluster is
not dynamically relaxed and likely to be a merging system.
At X-ray wavelengths, Chandra observations reveal the pres-
ence of a large-scale shock front (Million & Allen 2009)
with kT . 16 keV, high pressure and entropy which can
be associated with a merger-driven shock front. The X-
ray mass of Abell 2219 was estimated by Mahdavi et al.
(2008) on the basis of data available in the Chandra X-
ray Observatory public archive, obtaining a value of M500 =
17.32 ± 6.50 × 1014M⊙, and by Mantz et al. (2010) who ob-

We brieﬂy summarize some results of previous weak lensing
analyses of Abell 2219. Bardeau et al. (2007) investigated
this cluster as part of a sample of eleven X-ray luminous clus-
ters selected from the XBACs catalog (Ebeling et al. 1996)
in the narrow redshift range at z = 0.21 ± 0.04. The weak
lensing analysis was based on wide-ﬁeld images obtained
with the CFHT12k camera at the Canada-France-Hawaii-
Telescope (CFHT) in the B (5400 s), R (6300 s), and I
(3000 s) bands. The background galaxies were selected by
applying the magnitude cut 22.2 < R < 25.3, followed by
the color selection R-I & −0.7 to isolate galaxies above the
cluster red sequence. The resulting source number density
is 8 − 10 gal arcmin−2. The mass and the concentration
were estimated to be M200 = 2094± 435× h−1
70 1012M⊙ and
c200 = 3.84 ± 0.99.
Hoekstra (2007) performed an independent weak lensing
analysis using the same data of Bardeau et al. (2007). After
selecting galaxies in the magnitude range 21 < R < 25, he
used the photometry in B and R bands to remove galax-
ies that lie on the cluster red-sequence. The shear proﬁle
was corrected for the residual contamination by increasing
the observed shear by the factor 1 + fcg(θ), where fcg(r)
is the fraction of cluster galaxies at radius r. The value of
fcg as function of radius was determined by stacking sev-
eral other clusters. Using a value of hβi = 0.54 inferred
from the redshift distribution of the Hubble Deep Field
(HDF) (Fern´andez-Soto et al. 1999), and ﬁtting the tangen-
tial shear proﬁle with an NFW model, the resulting virial
mass was 11.3+3.2
−2.7 × h−1 1014M⊙. The ﬁt was done assum-
ing one free parameter (the mass) and using the relation
between concentration and mass proposed by Bullock et al.

12

I. Formicola et al.

(2001).
Okabe et al. (2010) also performed a weak lensing analysis
of Abell 2219 as part of their study of 30 clusters from the
Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS) sample. They
used only SUBARU data in R and V bands. The exposure
times were 24 and 18 minutes, respectively. The selection
of background sources was done combining the magnitude
cut 22 6 R 6 26 with color cuts to identify galaxies red-
der and bluer than the cluster red sequence. The optimal
selection was found by maximizing the mean amplitude of
the tangential shear proﬁle with respect to the color oﬀ-
set from the cluster red sequence. The resulting number
density of background sources was found to be ∼ 10 gal
arcmin−2. They estimate the virial mass and concentration
72 1014M⊙; cvir = 6.88+3.42
to be Mvir = 9.11+2.54
−2.16.
However, given the quality of their ﬁt to the tangential shear
proﬁle (reduced χ2 = 2.26 and the value of the signiﬁcance
probability Q used to quantify the goodness of the ﬁt of the
model), Okabe et al. (2010) concluded that the NFW model
does not describe well the data.

× 27

The observations of the cluster Abell 2219 were performed
with the Suprime-Cam mounted at the prime focus of the
SUBARU telescope, an 8.2 meter telescope located at the
summit of the Mauna Kea. The camera is a mosaic of ten
2048 x 4096 CCDs which covers a 34
ﬁeld of view
with a pixel scale of 0.20
. We analyze data publicly avail-
able in the BVR bands, retrieved from the SMOKA Science
Archive.
Images are reduced using the VST-Tube imaging pipeline
(Grado et al. 2012), a software designed to work on optical
astronomical images taken with diﬀerent instruments and
instrumental setups. The data reduction consisted in the
following steps: overscan correction, ﬂat ﬁelding, correction
of distortions due to optics and sky background subtraction.
The astrometric solution describing the distortions produced
by the optics and telescope was computed for each exposure
using the ASTROMC code (Radovich et al. 2004). This was
then used in the SWARP tool, which was used to resample
and coadd all exposures. The absolute photometric calibra-
tion of the images in each ﬁlter was achieved using standard
Stetson ﬁelds. The SDSS i -band image of Abell 2219 was
taken with the Large Binocular Camera mounted on the
prime focus of the 8.4m Large Binocular Telescope. LBC
has a ﬁeld of 23
and provides images with a sampling
of 0.225
/pixel. The data were taken in 2010; the data re-
duction was done by the LBC Data Centre using a pipeline
speciﬁcally designed for LBC data. Magnitudes in the BVRi
ﬁlters are in the AB system. The observation nights of the
images in each ﬁlter, the total exposure time, the photomet-
ric zero point of the ﬁnal coadded images and the average
FWHM for point-like sources are given in Table 4. Finally,
galaxy magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction us-
ing the maps produced by Schlegel et al. (1998).
We use the deep R band image to perform the weak lens-
ing analysis, while photometric catalogs in the B and V
bands are derived using SExtractor in dual-mode, with the
R band image used as the detection image. The masking of
reﬂection haloes and diﬀraction spikes near bright stars is
performed with the ExAM code described in Huang et al.

derived within the COSMOS survey by Capak et al. (2007):
+0.19 (B ), +0.04 (V ); according to Huang et al. (2011),
no oﬀset is required for the R band. We convolve the stellar
spectra from the Pickles’ library (Pickles 1985) by the trans-
mission curves. Comparing the colors obtained with those
derived for the stars in our catalog, we derive an oﬀset in
i magnitudes of +0.065. Fig. 5 shows this comparison after
adding the oﬀsets. We veriﬁed that the addition of these oﬀ-
sets improves the match of stellar colors in our data with
colors obtained from the convolution of the stellar spectra
from the Pickles’ library by the ﬁlter transmission curves.

6.4 Weak lensing analysis

6.4.1 Shape measurement

The observed shear signal produced by the gravitational ﬁeld
of the cluster Abell 2219 is reconstructed using our new KSB
implementation described in Sect. 3. The selection of stars
used to correct the distortions introduced by the PSF com-
ponents is made in the magnitude MAG AUTO vs. δ = MU
MAX-MAG AUTO space.
In Fig. 6, the star locus is deﬁned by objects populating
the vertical branch (green dots). Objects with δ lower than
stars are classiﬁed as spurious detections (black dots) while
galaxies are marked with blue dots. Saturated stars are
marked with red dots. We use stars with R magnitude in
the range [19, 22] to correct for the eﬀects introduced by
PSF anisotropy and seeing.
In Fig. 7 the ﬁrst three panels show stars measured, ﬁt-

ted and residuals ellipticities, while the last one shows stars
measured ellipticities (marked with blue dots), stars mod-
elled ellipticities (marked with red dots) and their values
after the correction (green dots). We obtain heaniso,1i =
(0.6 ± 1.2) × 10−4, heaniso,2i = (−6.9 ± 1.7) × 10−4.
The tangential and the cross components of the reduced
shear, gT and g×, are obtained from the quantities e1iso and
e2iso used, respectively, as g1 and g2 in Eq. 6 and Eq. 7.
The radial proﬁles are obtained averaging both shear com-
ponents in annular regions centered on the BCG.
We exclude from the catalog galaxies with SNe < 5 (our
choice of SNe < 5 corresponds to about S/N < 10), for
which the ellipticity measurement is not meaningful, and
galaxies with corrected ellipticities e1iso or e2iso > 1. The ﬁ-
nal catalog which will be used for the analysis has a number
density of ∼ 20 gal arcmin−2 .

6.4.2 Selection of the background galaxies

In this section, we describe the selection of the background
galaxies obtained with our method based on colors (Sect.
4 and Sect. 5.1). For comparison, we also use the alterna-
tive methods introduced earlier and based on photometric
redshifts, magnitude cuts, and identiﬁcation of the cluster
red-sequence.

6.4.2.1 Selection in color space We derive the V -R
vs B -R and the R-i vs B -V CC diagrams of the galaxies
in the ﬁeld of Abell 2219. Applying the selection described
in the Sect. 5.1 for the V -R and B -R colors we obtain a
background population with a number density of ∼ 13 gal
arcmin−2. The selection in V -R vs B -R space is represented
in the upper left panel of the Fig. 8. In all panels of Fig. 8,
galaxy sub-samples are shown using the same color-coding
of Fig. 2.
The selection based on the colors R-i and B -V according to
the criteria in Sect. 5.1 is represented in Fig. 8 (bottom left
panel). The number density of background galaxies is ∼ 14

gal arcmin−2.
The radial number density proﬁles of cluster members
clearly show overdensities at small radii as expected for clus-
ter member galaxies. The radial number density proﬁles of
background and foreground galaxies do not show cluster-
ing at small radii which rises from cluster member galaxies,
while they appear almost ﬂat since they are equally dis-
tributed on the sky except for a decrease at small radii due
to area loss by bright sources and the magniﬁcation bias
(Gray et al. 2000; Broadhurst et al. 2008) clearly evident in
the background samples and with a lower amplitude in the
foreground samples indicating the presence of background
sources in foreground selected samples. We check that the
decrease at small radii is eﬀectively due to the magniﬁca-
tion introduced by lensing measuring its signal in the case
of background galaxies selected in the V -R vs B -R space:

the outer region i.e. for θ > 10′. We obtain the following val-
ues for s = 0.02±0.001 and n0 = 16.8±0.3 galaxies arcmin−2
that we use to derive the expected magniﬁcation for a lens
described by a NFW density proﬁle as shown in Fig.9 (red

ﬁcation applied to the sample selected with the magnitude
cut 22 6 R 6 26 (back points in Fig.9). In this case, the rise
in the number counts at small radii is a clear evidence of
the presence of cluster members in the sample. The model
curve (black dot line) is overplotted to data.
The gT proﬁles of the cluster and foreground galaxies show a
positive value in some bins. This is similar to what found in
simulations, where we noticed that the subsamples of clus-
ter and foreground galaxies are contaminated by background
sources. The gT proﬁles of background sources nicely rise at
small radii. The g× proﬁles for each identiﬁed population
are consistent with zero, indicating the lack of systematic
errors arising from an imperfect PSF correction.
The consistency of the real and simulated data is further
veriﬁed showing in the Fig. 10 the magnitude distributions
of the background sources selected in V -R vs B -R diagram
in the two cases; and in the Fig. 11, their size distribution

6.4.2.2 Alternative selection methods We compare
results obtained with our selection method to those obtained
with other techniques to identify lensed galaxies: the identi-
ﬁcation based on a magnitude cut, that based on the iden-
tiﬁcation of the cluster red-sequence and ﬁnally the use of
photometric redshifts.
The selection based on magnitude cuts consists in consider-
ing as background galaxies those having magnitude in the
range 22 6 R 6 26.
The selection of background galaxies on the base of the col-
ors respect to the cluster red-sequence is done as described
in Sect. 5.3 (Okabe’s method).
In the following we reported our analysis with photometric

lected in V -R vs B -R diagram of Abell 2219 (red points) and with

redshifts. We use the photometry in four bands to derive
photometric redshifts using the ZEBRA code in Maximum-
Likelihood mode as described in Sect. 5.3. As done analyzing
the simulations, we do not use galaxies with photo-zs > 2
and σz/(1+z) > 0.1. For the galaxies with spectroscopic red-
shift given in Boschin et al. (2004) we ﬁnd hzphot − zspeci =
−0.017± 0.003. The sample given in Boschin et al. (2004) is

rived caused by a limited spectral coverage.

ric redshifts obtained, due to the limited number of bands
available and in particular to the lack of photometry in the
u passband.
For comparison, we compute the fraction of background
sources common to both the BVR and the photo-z selec-
tions. We ﬁnd that the two samples overlap at the level of
68%. In the case of the BVRi and to the photo-z selections,
we ﬁnd that the 72% of the sources are in common.

6.4.3 Mass estimate

Mass estimates of Abell 2219 are derived by ﬁtting the re-
duced tangential shear proﬁle with an NFW lens model, as
described in the Sect. 5.4. In this case, we perform the ﬁt
in two diﬀerent ways in order to compare our results with
those presented in literature. In the ﬁrst case, we use cvir and
Mvir as free parameters. In the second, we adopt the mass-
concentration relation proposed by Bullock et al. (2001) to
get rid of one of the two parameters. We denote these two
methods to estimate the mass with the acronyms nfw and
mnfw, respectively.
In Table 5, we summarize the results of our analysis. The
ﬁrst column describes the selection method applied. The
second column reports the number densities of background
sources selected in each case. The recovered masses and con-

characterized by galaxies with z 6 0.4 so it is not possible
to verify the accuracy of sources which have higher redshift
value. The accuracy of the photometric redshifts derived for
z > 0.4 is checked from the comparison with the Sloan Digi-
tal Sky Survey photometric redshifts of galaxies in the Data
Release 9, although the latter are obtained from shallower
images. We ﬁnd hzphot − zsloani = −0.066± 0.007. We select
as background galaxies those having zphot > 0.27 (Fig. 12,
both panels, magenta squares), as foreground galaxies those
having zphot < 0.19 (Fig. 12, both panels, green diamonds)
and as cluster galaxies those having 0.19 6 zphot 6 0.27
(Fig. 12, both panels, orange triangles). The number den-
sity of background galaxies selected in this way is ∼ 14 gal
arcmin−2. The radial number density proﬁle of foreground
galaxies shows an overdensity at small radii indicating the
presence of cluster galaxies in the sample (Fig. 12, upper
panel). This result reﬂects the low accuracy of the photomet-

centrations are given in columns 4-8. For comparison we
add the results in the case of a magnitude cut selection
and in the case of color-magnitude selection as described
in Okabe et al. (2010). We perform all the ﬁts in a range
< θ < 1000
of 30
since the lower limit for the radius
(θ = 30
) is chosen suﬃciently large so that the weak lens-
ing limit gT ≈ γT holds. The shear proﬁles obtained from
the selection in CC spaces and with photo-zs and the cor-
responding ﬁtted models are displayed in Fig. 13. In the
following, we compare our estimates of the mass of Abell
2219 with previous analyses found in literature. The weak
lensing analysis made by Bardeau et al. (2007) gives a value
of M200 = 2094± 435× h−1
70 1012 M⊙ and c200 = 3.84± 0.99.
The comparison of our results with those found in the pa-
per of Bardeau et al. (2007) is done performing the NFW
ﬁt with the ﬁxed value of cvir = 4.83, corresponding to
c200 = 3.84. The values of M200 found in our work are
smaller by a factor of 2.4 − 3 with respect to that found
in Bardeau et al. (2007).
The weak lensing analysis of Hoekstra (2007) gives a virial
mass of 11.3+3.2
−2.7 × h−1 1014 M⊙ derived using the relation
of Bullock et al. (2001), in agreement with our results.
Okabe et al. (2010) derived the weak lensing mass on the
base of SUBARU data in only two photometric bands (R
and V ). They found a value of Mvir = 9.11+2.54
72 1014
M⊙ and a concentration of cvir = 6.88+3.42
−2.16.
In order to get a comparison with the result obtained by
Okabe et al. (2010) we performed all the ﬁts using the same
values of the cosmological parameters of their paper and
ﬁxing cvir to the value found by the authors. The value of
the virial mass found by Okabe et al. (2010) is in agreement
with our results except for that derived selecting in the R-i
vs B -V space. However, the authors concluded that the ﬁt
of the NFW model to data does not give an acceptable result
on the base of the signiﬁcance probability Q used to quan-
tify the goodness of the ﬁt of the model, unlike the results
of this work. This can be due to the diﬀerent selections of
background sources in both works. This is further supported
by results on simulations in which the Okabe’s method is ap-
plied. In this case, the ﬁtted mass is lower than those derived
by the selection based on colors (Tab. 3). Okabe et al. (2013)
presented a new analysis with a signiﬁcantly revision of their
color-cut technique used to select background sources. The
paper shows the results of the stacked analysis of 50 galaxy
clusters but the individual cluster masses are not reported.
They claim that the new masses are higher by 14% − 20%
compared to the previous analysis, suggesting that such dif-
ference could arise from systematics in the shape measure-
ment methods and contamination by unlensed sources.

7 CONCLUSION

Dilution of the lensing signal due to unlensed sources can
crucially aﬀect the estimation of the cluster mass. We de-
veloped a new selection method for the background lensed
sources based on the simultaneous analysis of the shear sig-
nal and of the colors of the galaxies, with the photome-
try from the COSMOS used as training set. Our selection
method can be applied to the weak lensing analysis of clus-
ters, under diﬀerent cluster redshifts, masses and ﬁlter com-
binations. Its performance in the selection of the background

sources and its eﬀect on the dilution bias are tested using
simulations. To this end, we produced realistic SUBARU
and LBT images containing lensing signal with the SkyLens
code under diﬀerent cluster redshifts (z = 0.23 − 0.45),
masses (Mvir = 0.5 − 1.55 × 1015 M⊙) and ﬁlter combina-
tions. We showed with simulations that three photometric
bands are enough to obtain a safe sample of background
sources for the weak lensing analysis. The values of Mvir
obtained from the ﬁt of the expected NFW proﬁle to the
shear for the simulated clusters support a low contamina-
tion by unlensed sources in the samples selected by cuts in
the color-color space.
We ﬁnd that the ﬁtted values of Mvir obtained with our
selection agree with the true masses within . 10 − 15%.
On average, the ratio between estimated and true masses is
∼ 0.98 ± 0.09.
The simulations also allowed us to estimate the residual frac-
tion of unlensed galaxies in the samples of background galax-
ies, and the fraction of background galaxies misidentiﬁed as
foreground and cluster members. Color selections and pho-
tometric redshifts give less than the 11% of unlensed sources
contaminating the background selected samples, even if the
photo-zs have a low accuracy due to the limited spectral cov-
erage. A fraction of background lensed sources is lost since
they are misidentiﬁed as foreground and cluster galaxies in
a percentage varying for each kind of selection done. How-
ever, the low accuracy of the derived photo-zs could lead
to an additional bias in the cluster mass reconstruction due
to the wrong identiﬁcation of the value of hβi when esti-
mated from the photometric redshifts themselves. Its value
is smaller than the true value resulting in a over-estimate
of the mass of the lens by ∼ 11% with respect to the input
value.
Selections based on a simple magnitude cut or on the anal-
ysis of the color-magnitude diagram following the technique
described in Okabe et al. (2010) lead to a lower mass due to
a residual contamination by unlesed sources.
We further apply the developed selection method to Abell
2219. In our work, we used a new KSB implementation based
on the PSFex code (Radovich et al. 2015) to measure the ob-
served shear signal produced by the gravitational ﬁeld of the
cluster. As shown by simulations the high purity of the se-
lected samples obtained allows us to derive ﬁducial samples
of background sources on which an accurate cluster mass
reconstruction can be performed.
The virial mass of Abell 2219 was obtained for each kind of
selection by ﬁtting the NFW model to data. Our results are
in agreement with the previous analysis of Hoekstra (2007)
and Okabe et al. (2010) (for this last one makes exception
the selection in the R-i vs B -V space). However diﬀerently
from our results, Okabe et al. (2010) found that the NFW
shear model does not ﬁt the observed shear. This can arise
from diﬀerent selection criteria and source redshifts iden-
tiﬁcation used in the analyses, which can origin the other
diﬀerent results found in literature.
To conclude, in this paper we showed how using colors from
three photometric bands can improve the selection of back-
ground galaxies for the weak lensing analysis of galaxy clus-
ters: the selection is driven both by an external photometric
catalogue with known redshifts (the COSMOS catalogue),
and the maximization of the amplitude of the shear in the

Selecting background galaxies in cluster weak-lensing analyses

APPENDIX A: BIAS IN THE ESTIMATED
ELLIPTICITIES

The accuracy of the weak lensing analysis crucially depends
on the performance of the method used to correct for the
distortions introduced by the PSF components. Tests on
mock images were launched in the past to exploit this issue
(Erben et al. 2001; Heymans et al. 2006; Massey et al. 2007;
Bridle et al. 2010; Kitching et al. 2012). Ellipticities derived
by diﬀerent methods for the shape measurement are aﬀected
by a multiplicative (m) and an additive (c) bias deﬁned as:
eobs − etrue = metrue + c (Heymans et al. 2006). We try to
quantify this multiplicative bias measuring the shear from
the simulated images and comparing it to the true input
value. To this end we use the set of simulations described in
the Sect. 2 tailored on Abell 2219 observations in the BVRi
bands with exposure times as listed in Table 4. Simulated
images are characterized by a spatially constant gaussian
PSF with FWHM 0.6′′. We derive radial proﬁles of the tan-
gential component of the reduced shear, obtained using the
measured ellipticities (Fig. A1 top panel, black squares) and
their input values (Fig. A1 top panel, red squares) for back-
ground galaxies selected on the base of the input value of the
redshift in the simulations. In each radial bin θi we compute
the diﬀerence between the mean tangential reduced shear
obtained using the measured KSB ellipticities hgT(KSB)i and
that derived using their true input values hgT(REAL)i:

l(θi) = hgT(REAL)i − hgT(KSB)i

hgT(REAL)i

.

(A1)

We derive the mean value of l avoiding the three inner bins
characterized by a low statistic. In Fig. A1 (bottom panel),
we show how l(θi) changes with the amplitude of the mean
true reduced shear value hgT(REAL)i. We ﬁnd that, for these
simulations, our KSB pipeline on average underestimates
the measured shear of about 5% with respect to the input
values. Since the background sources derived in the analyses
of A2219 and of the simulated data are both dominated by
a SNR 6 40 (Fig. A2), we apply the correction factor of
1.05 to the measured ellipticities and use the so corrected
ellipticities to derive the cluster mass. A dependence of the
amplitude of the multiplicative shear calibration factor on
the amplitude of the shear signal could arise in intermediate
lensing regimes. We will further investigate this aspect in a
future work.

Figure A1. Top panel: gT radial proﬁles for the simulated lensed
galaxies obtained using the measured KSB ellipticities (black
squares) and their input values (red squares). Background galax-
ies are selected on the base of their input value of the redshift in
the simulation. Bottom panel: l(θi) as function of the amplitude
of the mean true reduced shear value hgT(REAL) i.

ground galaxies selected in the V -R vs B -R CC diagram in the
