Cells may control ﬂuctuations in protein levels by means of negative autoregulation, where transcription
factors bind DNA sites to repress their own production. Theoretical studies have assumed a single binding
site for the repressor, while in most species it is found that multiple binding sites are arranged in clusters.
We study a stochastic description of negative autoregulation with multiple binding sites for the repressor.
We ﬁnd that increasing the number of binding sites induces noisy oscillations of gene products. By tuning
the threshold for repression, we show that multiple binding sites can also suppress ﬂuctuations. Our results
highlight possible roles for the presence of multiple binding sites of negative autoregulators.

The state of living cells is determined by the molecules
they produce and their numbers [1]. Cells can control
the production of molecules by means of gene regu-
latory networks [2].
In these networks, transcription
factors are key proteins that bind DNA to activate
or repress synthesis [1, 2]. Negative autoregulation is
a common component of these networks in which a
transcription factor binds a speciﬁc site in the DNA
and prevents its own synthesis [2].
In E. coli, about
40% of transcription factors are negatively autoregu-
lated [3, 4, 2].

It is thought that negative autoregulation can speed
up response times [2, 4] and tame ﬂuctuations [5, 6, 7].
Since the number of some molecules in the cell can be
small and the process of molecular synthesis is subject
to ﬂuctuations in the cellular environment, the result-
ing molecule numbers are in general noisy [8, 7, 9, 10].
Such circuits can suppress noise by regulating the num-
ber of molecules that a cell produces, permitting or re-
pressing synthesis depending on the relative amount of
the molecule [5, 6]. However, negative autoregulation
can also boost ﬂuctuations if transcription factor bind-
ing is too strong [11]. A balance of timescales is key
for negative autoregulation to be able to act as a noise
suppressor [12, 13]. Furthermore, it has been argued
that the cost of suppressing noise by negative autoregu-
lation may be high due to ﬂuctuations in intermediate
signalling events [14]. Such intermediate events may
also introduce eﬀective delays and cause oscillations in
molecule numbers [15, 16, 17].

Despite its ubiquity, the eﬀects of noise on negative
autorregulation are still poorly understood. Theoret-
ical studies often assume a single binding site for a
transcriptional repressor or an eﬀective Hill function.
However, multiple binding sites for the same transcrip-
tion factor are known to form clusters within regula-
tory domains [18, 19, 20, 21]. This feature has been

widely observed in E. coli [20], eukaryotes [22, 23],
invertebrates [24] and vertebrates [25].
In fact more
than half of the human genes contain clusters of bind-
ing sites for the same transcription factor [25]. This
suggests that multiple binding sites for transcription
factors may play an important role in gene regula-
tion [25, 26].

In a deterministic system, multiple binding sites
can enhance non-linear eﬀects [27]. In a stochastic de-
scription, their occupation can have multiple states and
stochastic switching will occur between these states.
This could set an additional timescale which aﬀects
ﬂuctuations. Here we study how ﬂuctuations are af-
fected by multiple binding sites, in the framework of a
stochastic binding theory in which a single transcrip-
tion factor represses its own production, Fig. 1.

Multiple stochastic binding. We consider a single gene
encoding a protein that can bind to any of N sites to
repress its own synthesis. We introduce negative au-
toregulation as a dependence of the production rate

Figure 1: Negative autoregulation with multiple bind-
ing sites. Protein (blue circles) is synthesised from the
information in the gene (blue stripe) at a rate r(m).
Protein binds to the N binding sites (orange) at a rate
kb and falls oﬀ at a rate ku. Bound proteins repress
production when more than M proteins are bound
(blunted arrow). Free and bound protein are degraded
at the same rate d.

Fig. 1. We focus on noncooperative binding, that is the
aﬃnity of proteins for binding sites kb is not aﬀected
by how many molecules are bound already. Bound pro-
teins fall oﬀ from the binding site with a rate ku per
molecule. Both bound and free protein have a ﬁnite
half-life and decay at a rate d per molecule.

The statistics of the stochastic process can be de-
scribed by the probability distribution P (n, m, t) to
have n free proteins and m bound proteins at time
t [28]. This probability distribution obeys the master
equation

+ kb ((N − (m − 1))(n + 1)P (n + 1, m − 1, t))
− kb ((N − m)nP (n, m, t))

+ d ((n + 1)P (n + 1, m, t) − nP (n, m, t))
+ d ((m + 1)P (n, m + 1, t) − mP (n, m, t)) .

The ﬁrst line accounts for molecule production, the
second and third for the binding process, the fourth
for the unbinding process, and the two last lines for
degradation of free and bound molecules. The regu-
latory function r(m) can be adjusted to describe dif-
ferent regulatory mechanisms. In this work we focus
on threshold regulation, in which synthesis occurs at a
rate r0 while there are M or less bound proteins, and it
is fully repressed when there are more than M bound
proteins:

In general, changing parameters in the system will
aﬀect the steady state, in particular the mean value of
the total number of proteins (cid:104)nT(cid:105) = (cid:104)n + m(cid:105). We work
under the assumption that autoregulation controls the
level of proteins to keep it at some functional value in
steady state [2]. To meaningfully asses the eﬀects of
adding multiple binding sites we ﬁx (cid:104)nT(cid:105). To achieve
this, we adjust the synthesis rate r0 to compensate the
changes introduced by adding multiple binding sites.
In the following we choose the value (cid:104)nT(cid:105) = 20 for
illustration [11, 29, 13].

Methods. We generate trajectories satisfying equation
(1) by means of a standard Gillespie algorithm [30,
31]. We obtain the free n(t), bound m(t) and total
nT (t) = n(t) + m(t) number of proteins. The total
number of proteins nT is useful to compare theoreti-
cal results with experiments which do not distinguish
free and bound molecules. We use this approach to
analyse the dynamics of various quantities and to ap-
proximate steady state statistics. We also employ a
complementary approach to solve the master equation
(1), similar to [32]. The master equation can be writ-
ten in the form dP(t)/dt = AP(t) where A is a ma-
trix and P(t) is a vector of probabilities with elements

are the diﬀerent rates of the master equation (1). Each
line of the matrix A connects state {n, m} to other
states {˜n, ˜m}. We obtain the steady-state probability
distribution P (n, m) in the truncated space by solving
m,n P = 1.
From these probabilities P (n, m) we can compute the
statistics of n, m and nT in steady state.

the system AP = 0 with the constraint (cid:80)

Oscillations. We ﬁrst study the case in which a sin-
gle bound protein fully represses production, M = 0,
and vary the number of binding sites N . Deviations of
the total number of proteins nT from its mean value
(cid:104)nT(cid:105) increase with N , Fig. 2(a-c). Adding binding sites
to the system leads to bursty kinetics, with increasing
burst size and consequently longer decay times. This
is reﬂected on an increasing Fano factor, deﬁned as the
variance to mean ratio F = σ2
nT

/(cid:104)nT(cid:105), Fig. 2(d).

These bursts occur with some temporal regular-
ity. The time interval between two consecutive max-
ima naturally deﬁne burst duration T . Burst dura-
tion becomes longer while the relative dispersion of
the distribution around the mean decreases with in-
creasing N (Supplementary Information), as reﬂected
in the coeﬃcient of variation CV = σT /(cid:104)T(cid:105), Fig.2(e).

Protein numberFano FactorBurst Duration CvQuality Factor(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)(f)tiple binding sites introduce an eﬀective timescale in
the system, the time taken to exponentially decay from
the maximum to the minimum value of total number
of proteins (Supplementary Information). In addition,
the multiple binding sites act as a buﬀer for the bound
proteins: as long as the occupation number m is larger
than one, there can be ﬂuctuations in m and the system
is still repressed.

Noise suppression. We now turn to the eﬀects of chang-
ing the regulatory threshold M for a ﬁxed value of total
number of binding sites N . As M changes, we ad-
just the synthesis rate r0 accordingly to keep the mean
value (cid:104)nT(cid:105) ﬁxed. Increasing the regulatory threshold
M , ﬂuctuations decrease to a minimum and then rise
again, Fig. 3(a)-(d).

This minimum occurs when synthesis ﬂuctuations
are driven by the binding and unbinding of proteins
(Supplementary Information). For lower values of M ,
ﬂuctuations around the mean value of bound proteins
(cid:104)m(cid:105) are not suﬃcient to give rise to synthesis events
because a small number of molecules is enough to over-
come the low threshold. For higher values of M , ﬂuctu-
ations that bring m below threshold are more frequent
and synthesis rate is slower, resulting in a lax control
of the mean value of proteins (cid:104)nT(cid:105).

Noise suppression with multiple binding sites out-
performs the single binding site control system, see its
smaller variance and Fano factor, Fig. 3(c),(e). This
stronger noise suppression occurs for a range of M val-
ues, Fig. 3(f). Even in cases in which single binding site
regulation N = 1 increases ﬂuctuations [11, 13, 35], the
presence of multiple binding sites may bring noise be-
low the level for unregulated synthesis. Moreover, the
turnover of molecules does not change with the thresh-
old value, that is the number of molecules degraded
per unit time is constant for diﬀerent values of M ,
Fig. 3(g). This indicates that this noise suppression
mechanism comes at no extra cost for the system.

Oscillations and noise suppression are robust. So far
we focused on a set of parameters in which the bind-
ing and unbinding rates are equal, kb = ku. We now
relax this constraint and analyse the eﬀects of adding
multiple binding sites N and changing the regulatory
threshold M , Fig. 4. In the three diﬀerent cases span-
ning three orders of magnitude, adding multiple bind-
ing sites generates oscillations for low M , Fig. 4(a)-(c).
The smaller the ratio ku/kb, the larger the Quality fac-
tor and the region in {N, M} space where oscillations
are enhanced. Increasing the binding aﬃnity generates
longer decay times of the oscillations together with a
larger memory eﬀect.

The noise suppression mechanism discussed above
is present for a wide range of ku/kb ratios, Fig. 4(d)-
(f). We introduce the relative Fano factor FR, deﬁned
as the Fano factor normalised to its single binding site
value (N = 1 and M = 0). Values of FR smaller than
one reveal a region in {N, M} space in which noise
suppression outperforms the single binding site case,

without increasing the turnover. (a-e) Time series of

ulation N = 1, M = 0. Orange line indicates the mean

The single binding site result is displayed for reference
(dashed magenta line). Parameters: kb = ku = 335.5,
d = 1.

Thus, the characteristic time governing bursts timing
becomes both longer and more precise.

Temporal precision can be further characterized by
the frequency spectrum and the quality factor Q, de-
ﬁned as the ratio between bandwidth ∆f and main fre-
quency fc, Q = ∆f /fc. Higher values of Q indicate a
narrower frequency spectrum and a more deﬁned char-
acteristic time [15]. We ﬁt a Lorentzian distribution
to the frequency spectrum to obtain the quality factor
from numerical simulations (Supplementary Informa-
tion). We ﬁnd that Q grows with N above Q = 1,
indicating that noisy oscillations occur in the system.
Thus, in contrast to common wisdom about deter-
ministic systems [33, 34], we ﬁnd here that noisy oscil-
lations are possible even in the absence of explicit de-
lays or intermediate steps in the regulatory loop. Mul-

of transcription factors. This noise suppression occurs
without increasing the product turnover, suggesting a
mechanism that could decrese the high cost of regu-
latory control systems [14]. Noise can be tamed even
when single binding site regulation aggravates ﬂuctua-
tions with respect to unregulated synthesis [11, 13, 35].
Thus, noise suppression can be rescued from this sit-
uation without changing the aﬃnity of the molecules
for the binding sites.

Cellular control systems use negative autoregula-

tion in diﬀerent contexts either to generate oscillations [36,
41, 42], or to control the level of some target molecules
by suppressing number ﬂuctuations [5, 6, 2]. Multi-
ple binding sites, occurring in diﬀerent natural reg-
ulatory systems [25, 20, 18, 37], may enhance these
functions. While there may be other mechanisms that
perform these feats, as for example cooperativity [43]
and cooperative binding [44, 45, 19], we argue that
adding binding sites to the regulatory region of a gene
might be a simpler and more straightforward evolution-
ary path [2]. Short local duplications of the genome
can easily increase the copy number of binding sites
for transcription factors [26]. Microsatellites, which
are tandem arrays of multiple copies of a short se-
quence [26, 46], have a signiﬃcant overlap with tran-
scription factor binding sites [47, 48]. Our results could
be useful in the design of synthetic control systems that
either generate oscillations [41, 42] or tightly control
ﬂuctuations around the mean number of molecules [5,
6].

is a regulatory threshold M that reduces ﬂuctuations.
As the ratio ku/kb increases the region of noise sup-
pression becomes larger and the relative suppression
eﬀect stronger. This is in line with the ﬁnding that
weak binding is critical for the ﬁdelity of autoregula-
tion [13].

Discussion. We studied the stochastic dynamics of
a negatively autoregulated gene with multiple bind-
ing sites for the repressor, Fig. 1. We showed that
increasing the number of binding sites induces noisy
oscillations of gene products, Fig. 2. This is at odds
with the result for deterministic systems, where explicit
time delays or multiple intermediate steps are required
together with strong nonlinearity in order to gener-
ate biochemical oscillations [33, 34]. The system we
study here does not include such intermediate steps or
delays, but the stochastic dynamics of multiple bind-
ing sites occupation introduces an additional eﬀective
timescale that triggers the oscillations. Thus, our re-
sults establish a paradigm for biochemical oscillators.
The vertebrate segmentation clock [36] may be a good
model system to test our results. This genetic oscilla-
tor acting during embryonic development is thought
to be driven by negative autoregulation of her/Hes
genes, which have several regulatory binding sites for
the repressors [18, 37, 38]. Although it is thought that
autoregulation of such her genes involves eﬀective de-
lays [39, 37], it is possible that the presence of multi-
ple binding sites enhances oscillations. This hypothesis
could be tested for example by interfering with binding
sites [40].

For a ﬁxed number of binding sites we showed that
tuning the threshold for autoregulation, noise suppres-
sion can be enhanced, Fig. 3. Noise suppression ap-
pears to be strongest when synthesis events are di-

the total number of binding sites N increase the mean

since the sum of all the power spectrum is not normal-
ized. The Lorentzian function has a location parameter
fc which speciﬁes the peak of the distribution, and a
dispersion parameter γ which speciﬁes the half-width
at half-maximum. 2γ speciﬁes the full width at half
maximum

where fc is the central frequency and ∆f the half power

narrower frequency spectrum and a more deﬁned char-
acteristic time. In oscillatory time series the Quality
factor measures the number of oscillations over which

Supplementary Note 3:
Amplitude distribution, Burst duration
distribution, and decay time for M = 0

When only one protein inhibit the synthesis, this is
when M = 0, the oscillatory dynamic is deﬁned mainly
by two types of events, the bursty expression, and the
decay of the proteins, FIG 2 main text. We can try to
estimate both the amplitude and the duration of the
cycles from the parameters of the system. Expression
events, the bursts, occur only when when m = 0.

For illustration we can start in the initial state
(n, m) = (0, 0), production is the only possible reac-
tion of the system with a rate r and a characteristic
time τ = 1/r. Once we have a production event the
system is in the state (n, m) = (1, 0), and now degra-
dation and binding events are possible in the system.
After ˜n production events the state of the system is
(n, m) = (˜n, m). In this situation the probabilities of
degradation, synthesis, and binding are:

and are the only possible reactions during a burst event.
For typical values of this work when M = 0 and ˜n > 1,
r (cid:29) d˜n and kbN ˜n (cid:29) d˜n , so the probability of the
degradation reaction pdeg,˜n ∼ 0. We can neglect degra-
dation events and only analyse synthesis and binding
events during the burst.

From probabilities (6) and (7), and the fact that
there is no degradation, can compute the probabil-
ity distribution of a binding event after ˜n production

is shown a time series with the decay prediction. The
cycle stops when the last bound protein m = 1 unbinds
from the DNA or is degraded and a new synthesis burst
occurs.

We want to estimate is how many proteins there
are in the system before the regulatory region in the
DNA is free again, this is the value of nT when m = 1.
From the stationary probability matrix, we can com-
pute the probability distribution for nT total proteins
in the system and only one protein bound to the DNA,
this is P (nt | m = 1). This probability distribution
let us compute the last number of total proteins or the
minimum value of total protein number in the cycle

protein event

After a binding event m (cid:54)= 0 and no more synthesis
events are possible, setting the maximum value of the
total protein of number nT = ˜n for the cycle. With
the probability distribution (8) we can compute the
distribution and the mean value of the burst maxima,
FIG 7(a).
After the initial burst and a binding event, since
kbN ˜n (cid:29) d˜n the bound protein often fully occupies all
available sites, m ∼ N . Under this condition ﬂuctua-
tions of m that cross the threshold M can be neglected
and decay time can be analysed in a more determinis-
tic fashion. When there is at least one protein bound
to the DNA, only events of degradation, binding and
unbinding are possible. In terms of the total amount
of protein nT = m + n, events of binding and unbind
do not change the total amount of proteins and only
degradation events change the number of proteins. The
deterministic diﬀerential equations when m > 0 for the
the free, bound and total proteins are

= −kb(N − m)n + kum − dn
= kb(N − m)n − kum − dm

We can add both equations to analyse the evolution of
the total number of proteins nT = n + m

Using the maximum value of the burst nT,burst, the
minimum nT,min, and the decay evolution (11) we can
compute the duration of the cycle as

with probability distribution (8). In ﬁgure 7 the distri-
bution of burt duration is shown with an estimation of
the mean duration and the standard deviation. This
characteristic time is set by the burst size, the decay of
the total number of proteins, and the number of bind-
ing sites N and regulatory architecture M of the DNA.

Noise suppression and bound proteins statis-
tics

We computed the mean value and the statistics of the
bound proteins m for diﬀerent parameters in order to
give an explanation to the behaviour of the CV when
M varies, FIG 3 Main Text.
We computed the mean value of the bound pro-
teins (cid:104)m(cid:105) and the conﬁdence intervals in a situation in
which there is no degradation and no synthesis for a
ﬁxed value of total number of proteins, d = r = 0 and
nT = 20, FIG 8(a). This situation provides a refer-
ence of the ﬂuctuations of the bound proteins because
the binding and unbinding dynamics and not because
of ﬂuctuations in the number of proteins due to syn-
thesis or degradation. The mean value (cid:104) ˆm(cid:105) and the
conﬁdence interval under this situation are indepen-
dent of the regulatory threshold and only depends on
the binding and unbinding rates and the number of
binding sites.

When there is degradation and synthesis, for low
values of M bound protein m ﬂuctuations around the

mean (cid:104)m(cid:105) are not enough to cross the threshold, FIG 8(a).
Degradation of the total number of proteins is needed
in order to obtain synthesis events. This degradation
down-deviates the mean value of the total number pro-
teins from the mean value (cid:104)nT(cid:105). Since probability of
ﬁnding the gene active is very low, FIG 8(b), synthe-
sis events occur in a burst leading to deviation over
the mean, in order to ﬁx the mean value (cid:104)nT(cid:105) = 20.
The need of degradation to obtain synthesis events,
and the very short synthesis activity events leads to a
bursty dynamic and high and long ﬂuctuations from
the mean. Because of the need of degradation, mean
value of bound proteins is lower than in the no produc-
tion no synthesis case (cid:104)m(cid:105) < (cid:104) ˜m(cid:105), and the ﬂuctuations
of bound proteins are bigger.

For high values of M bound protein m ﬂuctua-
tions are enough to cross the threshold. Further more,
for the highest values of M the mean value is under
the threshold (cid:104)m(cid:105) ≤ M , FIG 8(a).
In this situation
the probability of ﬁnding the gene active is big and ,
FIG 8(b), and in order to keep (cid:104)nT(cid:105) = 20 the synthesis
rate is low. This leads to a slow response when the total
number of proteins is under the mean down-deviating
the total number of proteins. Since the number of free
binding sites is typically low, binding events that over-
come the threshold are not so frequent. This leads to
an over synthesis even when the number of proteins is
over the mean value nt ≥ (cid:104)nt(cid:105). The slow response in
both situations results in a lazy control and increase
the deviations from the mean.
