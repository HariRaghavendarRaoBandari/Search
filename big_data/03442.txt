Using the chiral kinetic theory we derive the electric and chiral current densities in inhomogeneous
relativistic plasma. We also derive equations for the electric and chiral charge chemical potentials
that close the Maxwell equations in such a plasma. The analysis is done in the regimes with and
without a drift of the plasma as a whole. In addition to the currents present in the homogeneous
plasma (Hall current, chiral magnetic, chiral separation, and chiral electric separation eﬀects, as
well as Ohm’s current) we derive several new terms associated with inhomogeneities of the plasma.
Apart from various diﬀusion-like terms, we ﬁnd also new dissipation-less terms that are independent
of relaxation time. Their origin can be traced to the Berry curvature modiﬁcations of the kinetic
theory.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays there is a widespread interest in relativistic plasmas with a chiral asymmetry. This interest is driven
by a recent progress in the understanding of basic properties of numerous relativistic or pseudorelativistic systems,
ranging from Dirac and Weyl semimetals in condensed matter [1], whose low-energy quasiparticle excitations are
described by the Dirac and Weyl equations, to strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma created experimentally in heavy-
ion collisions [2–4], and to the primordial plasma in the early Universe [5, 6]. One of the most unusual features of
a chiral relativistic plasma, which is absent in a conventional non-relativistic one, is the possibility of a macroscopic
realization of the celebrated quantum anomalies [7]. For example, in a chirally asymmetric plasma in a magnetic
ﬁeld B with an imbalance between the number densities of right- and left-handed fermions (described semirigorously
by the chiral chemical potential µ5), the chiral anomaly induces a new type contribution to the electric current:
ej = e2µ5B/(2π2c) [8–11]. The latter is known as the chiral magnetic eﬀect [12, 13]. The Maxwell equations,
amended by such a contribution to the electric current, become anomalous Maxwell equations [14–23].

The inclusion of the anomalous currents drastically changes the self-consistent evolution of chiral charge densities
and helical magnetic ﬁelds [14, 18, 19, 21–23]. Moreover, the nonlinear interactions due to anomalous processes induce
an eﬀective mechanism for transferring the energy from magnetic modes with short wavelengths (strongly aﬀected by
dissipation) to modes with longer wavelengths (and longer lifetimes) — a phenomenon similar to the inverse cascade
in ordinary magnetohydrodynamics [24], but driven not by turbulence. Depending on the chosen initial conditions,
it was found that the helicity can be transferred from the fermions to the magnetic ﬁelds or vice versa. These results
support the suggestion made in Ref. [25] that all degrees of freedom with non-vanishing axial charge are equally
excited in the equilibrium.

The chiral anomaly in a relativistic matter exhibits itself not only via the chiral magnetic eﬀect. Even if a chiral
asymmetry is absent, a nonzero magnetic ﬁeld can induce an axial current j5 = eµB/(2π2c) in a plasma with a nonzero
electric chemical potential. This phenomenon is known as the chiral separation eﬀect [26]. Another prediction of the
anomalous Maxwell equations in a relativistic plasma, that utilizes an interplay of the chiral separation and chiral
magnetic eﬀects, is a new type of collective excitation known as the chiral magnetic wave [27]. Further development
of these ideas is anomalous hydrodynamics, which contains new terms due to the chiral anomaly [22, 28–33].

The present study investigates the role of inhomogeneities in the chiral plasma evolution. Since the chiral anomaly
relation is local, it is clear that the electric and chiral chemical potentials should be inhomogeneous just like the
helical electromagnetic ﬁelds. An important question is whether additional contributions to the electric current exist
in the inhomogeneous case. The authors of Ref. [15] postulated the absence of such currents, while a diﬀerent set of
equations was proposed in a recent study [22]. The present paper derives such inhomogeneous currents in a systematic
way. Our starting point in the analysis is the chiral kinetic theory [34–36].

This paper is organized as follows. We brieﬂy review the chiral kinetic theory and kinetic equations in Sec. II.
The expressions for the electric and axial currents and equations for the local equilibrium chemical potentials in

2

inhomogeneous chiral plasma in the drifting state are derived in Sec. III. The electric and chiral currents to the
second order in electromagnetic ﬁeld and derivatives are calculated in Sec. IV in the case where neutral particles exert
a substantial drag on the system. The summary and conclusions are given in Sec. V. Some table integrals and useful
relations are collected in Appendix A.

II. CHIRAL KINETIC THEORY

The chiral kinetic theory describes a time evolution of the one-particle distribution functions fλ(t, x, p) for the right-
(λ = +) and left-handed (λ = −) fermions. It was recently suggested [34, 37, 38] that chiral fermions in external
electromagnetic ﬁelds are described by the chiral kinetic theory given by [34, 35]

where the factor (1 + eB · Ωλ/c)−1 accounts for the correct phase-space volume [37, 38] and Ωλ = λp/(2|p|3) is
the Berry curvature [39]. The Berry curvature is a crucial ingredient in the chiral kinetic theory that allows one
to capture the fermionic nature of particles [34–36]. The group velocity is deﬁned from the quasiparticle energy as
follows: v ≡ ∂ǫp/∂p. By imposing the constraint of the Lorentz invariance in Ref. [34], it was suggested that the
dispersion relation for chiral fermions in a magnetic ﬁeld B should be taken in the form ǫp = c|p| − λep · B/|p|2,
which is valid to linear order in the ﬁeld when |eB|/(cp2) ≪ 1. Interestingly, however, such a deﬁnition for ǫp may be

problematic because the absolute value of the resulting group velocity, v = cp1 + 2e (B · Ωλ) /c + O(B2), appears to

be larger than the speed of light when (B · Ωλ) > 0. In the present study, we will use the dispersion relation ǫp = c|p|
for which the group velocity equals c.

Eq. (1) is the kinetic equation for the distribution function f i

λ of particles (i = p). A separate equation can be
written down for antiparticles (i = a). The corresponding equation can be obtained by simply replacing e → −e and
λ → −λ in Eq. (1). Below, when there is no risk of confusion, we will omit index i and assume that the expressions
are given for particles. In the end, the results for charge densities and current densities will have to contain both
particle and antiparticle contributions.

The term on the right-hand side of the kinetic equation (1) is a collision integral. In the simplest approximation,
one can take Icoll = 0. This corresponds to the so-called collisionless limit, which is useful when the collective particle
dynamics is driven primarily by averaged electromagnetic ﬁelds. One of the simplest approximations beyond the
collisionless limit is the relaxation-time approximation with Icoll = −(fλ−f (eq)

)/τ [40, 41], where τ ∼ 1/(cid:2)e4T ln(1/|e|)(cid:3)

is the local equilibrium distribution function. In the absence of electromagnetic

(2)

where ǫp = c|p|. The corresponding equilibrium distribution function for antiparticles is obtained by replacing
µλ → −µλ. Here we introduced the notation for the chemical potentials of the right- and left-handed fermions,
µλ(t, x) = µ(t, x) + λµ5(t, x).
It should be noted that, in the case of local equilibrium, the temperature T in
distribution functions could also depend on the space-time coordinates, T (t, x). However, in order to simplify our
analysis below, we will neglect such a dependence in what follows. In the presence of electromagnetic ﬁelds, the choice
of f (eq)

(t, x, p) is a delicate issue and we will discuss it in more detail below.

In a general case, the local equilibrium chemical potentials µλ evolve with time. Therefore, one of the central and
crucial points of our analysis is the evolution equations for µλ which we derive from the kinetic equation. Integrating
the left-hand side of the kinetic equation (1) over momentum leads to the continuity equations for the electric and
chiral currents, where the latter equation includes the chiral anomaly term. This means that in order that the particles
densities be conserved it is necessary that the integral of the collision integral over momentum be equal zero. This
requirement will play a crucial role in our analysis below.

in the presence of strong magnetic ﬁelds, where the chiral chemical potential evolves with time, it is crucial to use

We checked, however, that the results obtained for the BGK-type collision integral with f (eq)

approximation with Icoll = −(fλ − f (eq)

As we see, this contribution is a total curl and, thus, does not contribute to the continuity equation. However, such a
current aﬀects the Maxwell equation (6). From the structure of the corresponding equation and the structure of the
current, we see that the integral on the right hand on Eq. (10) plays the role of a magnetization. Then, the current
itself can be viewed as a “magnetization” current [44].

It is instructive to emphasize that, in the case of hot relativistic plasmas, it is essential that the complete expressions
for the electric/chiral charge densities, as well as the corresponding currents contain the contributions of both particles
and antiparticles. This is in contrast to the case of dense relativistic plasmas at low temperatures, T ≪ |µλ|, when
the contributions of antiparticles are exponentially suppressed and, therefore, could be safely neglected. In the high-
temperature regime, T ≫ |µλ|, which is of prime importance in cosmology, the antiparticle number densities are given
by the same expressions as in Eq. (7), but in terms of the antiparicle distribution functions f a
λ. Taking into account
that antiparticles carry the opposite electric charge, we will ﬁnd that, as expected, the corresponding high-temperature
plasma will be almost neutral. Perhaps even more importantly, antiparticles will contribute approximately as much
as particles to the electric current and, thus, will eﬀectively double the result.

It is interesting to note that taking the contribution of antiparticles into account is critical also in order to obtain
the correct chiral anomaly relation from Eq. (8). The right-hand side of the corresponding equation for particles is
proportional to the local equilibrium distribution function f p(eq)
(p = 0), which depends on µλ and temperature. This
seems to be at odds with the topological nature of the corresponding relation. The same is true for antiparticles.
λ does satisfy the

conventional continuity equation with the correct anomalous term e2E · B/(2π2c). Note that, in the low-temperature
regime, the correct result is saturated almost exclusively by the contribution of particles. (Of course, it is easy to

check that the electric current ej =PiPλ=± eiji

The complete set of the Maxwell equations (3) through (6), the kinetic equation (1) in the relaxation time approx-
imation supplemented by the deﬁnitions of the number densities (7) and currents (9) form a system of self-consistent
equations for the one-particle distribution functions of the left- and right-handed fermions and electromagnetic ﬁelds.
Therefore, to study, for example, the evolution of inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds and chiral asymmetry in magnetized
plasma, one should solve the corresponding system of equations. The corresponding task is formidable. In order to
simplify it, we will derive an approximate set of equations in the case where electromagnetic ﬁelds are weak.

λ satisﬁes the usual non-anomalous continuity equation.)

Before proceeding to the derivation of a complete set of equations that describe the evolution of an inhomogeneous
chiral plasma coupled to electromagnetic ﬁelds, it is instructive to identify generic classes of such plasmas, depending
on their composition and underlying dynamics. In particular, as will become clear below, an important role in the
analysis is played by a possible presence of additional neutral particles and their interactions with the charged carriers
of the plasma.

In order to understand the role of neutral particles better, let us remind a very special property of a plasma that
contains no such particles. When a conﬁguration of perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E ⊥ B (assuming only
that E < B), is applied, such a plasma drifts as a whole with the velocity perpendicular to both electric and magnetic
ﬁelds [45]

¯v = c

E × B

B2

,

(11)

see also Sec. III below. It is crucial that the drift velocity ¯v does not depend on the speciﬁc values of charges (and
masses, if present) of particles. In fact, despite the drift, the plasma is in perfect equilibrium. It is described by a
boosted, rather than the usual form of the Fermi–Dirac distribution function. (This can be also understood from a
diﬀerent angle: there is no electric ﬁeld in the boosted reference frame, moving with the velocity ¯v with respect to
the laboratory frame.)

It should be clear that the above-mentioned drifting state of the plasma should be profoundly aﬀected whenever
a background is present that exerts a drag on the system. In solid state materials, for example, the corresponding
background could be due to the lattice of ions or impurities. In other plasmas, it could be due to neutral particles,
which are not aﬀected by electromagnetic ﬁelds directly. In the latter case, of course, it is assumed that the time scale
for the neutral component to develop its own drift (via the interaction with the charged particles) is much longer than
the characteristic time scales for the evolution of electromagnetic ﬁelds and inhomogeneities.

In this paper, we will discuss both cases with and without a drift of the plasma as a whole. Perhaps one of the best
realistic examples of the plasma that is subject to the drift is a relativistic QED electron-positron plasma. An example
of a plasma where the drift may not fully develop to involve the background of neutral particles is the quark-gluon
plasma at suﬃciently high temperatures. The (electromagnetically) neutral particles in the latter case are gluons. In
the case of chiral plasmas in Dirac/Weyl semimetals, the background is due to the lattice ions or impurities that do
not develop any drift at all.

III. CHIRAL PLASMA IN THE DRIFTING STATE: EXPANSION IN Ek, B, AND DERIVATIVES

In this section, we will derive the equations describing the evolution of a weakly inhomogeneous chiral plasma and
electromagnetic ﬁelds without any additional components (e.g., neutral particles, pinned impurities, or ion lattices)
present that could exert a substantial drag on the charged particles.
If additional components are present, it is
assumed that their interaction with charged particles is negligible and has no qualitative eﬀect on the electromagnetic
dynamics. We will use the kinetic equation (1) in the relaxation time approximation. The distribution functions for
charged particles (i = p) and their antiparticles (i = a) satisfy the following equations:

the drift of the plasma as a whole by a modiﬁed distribution function. The line of arguments that allows one to obtain
the corresponding function is well known.

Before considering a general conﬁguration of electromagnetic ﬁelds, let us start by recalling that a ﬁeld conﬁguration
with constant E ⊥ B (and E < B) has no dissipative eﬀects on the plasma. (Of course, this will change when the
parallel component Ek is added later.) The whole system simply drifts with the velocity ¯v [45], see Eq. (11). Of
course, this is connected with the fact that, in the reference frame K ′, moving with the drift velocity ¯v with respect to
the laboratory reference frame K, the electric ﬁeld is absent [46]. In the absence of electric ﬁeld in the K ′ frame, the
equilibrium state is naturally described by the standard Fermi–Dirac distribution function in the relativisitic notation
[47] (for the sake of simplicity, we suppress the particle/antiparticle index i)

assumes that either no neutral particles are present or that their interaction is too weak to change the evolution of
electromagnetic ﬁelds in the inhomogeneous plasma on the timescale of order τ .

By performing the inverse Lorentz transformation in Eq. (13), we easily ﬁnd the equilibrium distribution function

diﬃcult to check that the distribution function (14) is indeed a stationary solution of the kinetic equation (12) for
constant perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

The velocity ¯v = cE × B/B2 is known in the plasma physics as the drift velocity [45] because the motion of charged
particles in constant perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds is the superposition of circular motion around a point
called the guiding center and a drift of this point with the velocity ¯v. It is crucially important for us that the drift
velocity does not depend on the charges (and masses) of particles. In fact, this remains true also in a non-relativistic
plasma.

It should be emphasized that the plasma drift is well deﬁned only when E⊥ < B.

In this case the drift speed
¯v = cE⊥/B is smaller than the speed of light c. In the opposite case, E⊥ > B, there is no reference frame K ′, in
which the perpendicular component of the electric ﬁeld vanishes.

By using function (14) as the zeroth order approximation for the distribution function, let us proceed to the analysis
of the general case when the parallel component of the electric ﬁeld Ek is also present and drives the system out of
equilibrium. We will seek the solution for fλ in the form of an expansion, i.e.,

This is a new topological contribution, associated with the drift of plasma. It is induced when there are both parallel
and perpendicular components of the electric ﬁeld. While it is intimately connected with the chiral magnetic eﬀect,
it is not just a Lorentz boosted form of it in the laboratory frame.

To the ﬁrst order in gradients and ﬁelds, the magnetization current is given by

plasma.

Note that, in the limit of small drift velocities ¯v/c → 0, these functions are nonsingular: g0 ≃ 2/3 + O(cid:0)¯v2/c2(cid:1),
g1 ≃ O (¯v/c), and g2 ≃ O(cid:0)¯v3/c3(cid:1).

The result in Eq. (24) renders the standard chiral separation and chiral magnetic eﬀect currents.

Eq.(21) gives the following currents due to the Hall eﬀect as well as its generalization to the case of axial current:

These have the expected structure and are not very surprizing. Much more surprizing are the new contributions to
current densities in Eq. (25). The corresponding currents appear to be of topological origin. Indeed, they appear
due to the presence of the Berry connection in the deﬁnition of current (9) and do not depend on temperature or the
relaxation time τ . They give rise to the following electric current and axial current densities:

These currents resemble the chiral magnetic/separation currents, but ﬂow perpendicularly to the magnetic ﬁeld.
They are of the ﬁrst order in electromagnetic ﬁelds and appear to be non-dissipative. The fact that these currents are
proportional to E·B may hint at their possible connection with the chiral anomaly. We also observe that currents (33)
and (34) are deeply connected with the existence of the plasma drift. They exist only when both the perpendicular
and parallel components of the electric ﬁeld are nonvanishing. This latter suggests that the new topological currents
cannot be eliminated, or reduced to the chiral magnetic/separation currents, by a simple boost transformation.

The Ohm’s current in Eq. (27) has only the longitudinal projection with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld. This is
due to the fact that the perpendicular component of the electric ﬁeld is exactly accounted in the drift velocity. In
addition to the standard Ohm’s and diﬀusion currents, given by the ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (27), there are also other
(3)
dissipative contributions in j
λ , which are associated with the inhomogeneity of the drift ﬂow. These latter appear
to be connected with a nonzero viscosity of chiral plasma.

In the complete set of the anomalous Maxwell equations, these two relations determine how local equilibrium electric
and chiral chemical potentials evolve in a self-consistent way in a chiral plasma.

IV. EXPANSION IN POWERS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AND DERIVATIVES

In the previous section, we studied the chiral plasma in the drifting state. This allowed us to account for the plasma
drift exactly in the zeroth approximation of the distribution function. In this section, we consider the case where
neutral particles exert a substantial drag on the system so that one can use the Fermi–Dirac distribution function
(2) as the equilibrium distribution function. We will treat both electric and magnetic ﬁelds as perturbations. From
a physics viewpoint, this is the regime of a large collision rate [45, 48]. In this case, an expansion in powers of both
electric and magnetic ﬁelds is justiﬁed. Since the calculations in this case become much simpler than those in the
previous section, we will derive the expressions for the densities and currents to the second order in electromagnetic
ﬁelds and derivatives.

A. Distribution function to quadratic order in electromagnetic ﬁelds and derivatives

We seek the solution to Eq. (12) in the form of a series in powers of electromagnetic ﬁelds, i.e.,

fλ = f (eq)

λ + δf (1)

λ + δf (2)

λ + · · ·

(38)

and treat each space/time derivative as an extra power of electromagnetic ﬁeld. By substituting the above ansatz in
Eq. (12) and keeping the terms up to linear order in electromagnetic ﬁelds, we obtain:

(40)

Here, by deﬁnition, Eλ ≡ E − e−1∂µλ/∂x. By making use of this result, we derive the following formal results for the
densities and currents:

where sign(ei) was included in order to correctly account for the contribution of antiparticles. As is clear, to this
order, the magnetization current in Eq. (10) does not contribute. Then, by making use of the continuity equation, to
linear order in the ﬁelds and derivatives we obtain

This result implies that the time derivative of µλ unlike the case of the drifting state considered in the previous section
vanishes to linear order. In fact, as we will see below, it is of second order in ﬁelds. Taking this into account, the
leading order correction to the distribution function takes the following form:

Having determined the corrections to the local equilibrium distribution function in the ﬁrst and second order in

To this quadratic order, we had to also take into account the magnetization current in Eq. (10). The corresponding

where we used the Maxwell equation (4) in the last equality. In the continuity equation, of course, such a current

These equations determine how local equilibrium electric and chiral chemical potentials evolve in an inhomogeneous
chirally asymmetric plasma. In order to complete our derivation of anomalous Maxwell equations for inhomogeneous
chiral plasma, we should ﬁnd the explicit expressions for the currents to the second order in electromagnetic ﬁeld and
derivatives.

Since electric and chiral chemical potentials are much smaller than temperature in a primordial plasma, it is useful

It is interesting to point that the equations of motion for the chemical potentials contain the diﬀusion terms, pro-
portional to ∇2µ5/3 and ∇2µ/3, with the diﬀusion constant given by τ c2/3. This is in agreement with the general
arguments in Ref. [27]. Our derivation in the present paper not only establishes such a term, but also leads to a formal
expression for the diﬀusion constant in terms of the relaxation time. In general, in the presence of a nonzero magnetic
ﬁeld, one expects that there are two diﬀerent diﬀusion terms, a longitudinal one proportional to ∂2
z µλ and a transverse
one proportional to ∆T µλ, see, for example, Eq. (9) in Ref. [49]. By making use of the chiral kinetic theory, both
diﬀusion terms can be rigorously derived. As we see from our analysis above, to the quadratic order in the ﬁelds, the
longitudinal and transverse diﬀusion constants are the same. It can be shown, however, that the longitudinal diﬀusion
constant will have a nonzero correction of order B2 that comes from the term of the type (B · ∇)(B · ∂µλ/∂x).

In the case of a constant magnetic ﬁeld and vanishing electric ﬁeld, the above set of the equations has a solution
in the form of a (diﬀusive) chiral magnetic wave. Indeed, by setting E = 0 and assuming that the magnetic ﬁeld B is
constant, we ﬁnd that there is a solution that describes a diﬀusive chiral magnetic wave with the following dispersion
relation:

Obviously, the ﬁrst term describes the current of the chiral magnetic eﬀect, which is the current induced by a nonzero
chiral chemical potential along the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. The second terms combines the Ohm’s and diﬀusion
currents. Let us note that the conductivity equals

In order to apply our results for a deconﬁned quark-gluon plasma, one could ﬁx the relaxation time parameter by
using the lattice results [50, 51] for the quark-gluon plasma conductivity (obtained at T = 1.45Tc) and Eq. (68):

τ ≃ 0.37

αT

≃ 375 fm/c(cid:18) 240 MeV

T

(cid:19) .

(71)

The last ﬁve terms in Eq. (67) are new types of terms that are produced by time dependent electric and magnetic
ﬁelds and gradients of the chemical potentials and, to the best of our knowledge, have not been discussed in the
literature before. We will discuss the physical meaning of each of them, as well as their possible implications in the
subsection below.

A few words are in order about the third term in Eq. (67), which is nothing else but the celebrated Hall current. At
the ﬁrst sight it appears to be strange that the corresponding current is proportional to the square of the relaxation
time. Yet, we emphasize that this is a standard result in the limit of large collision rate (small τ ), see for example,
Sec. 6.10 in Ref. [45]. Moreover, the usual experimental setup for measuring the Hall eﬀect, in which one enforces
jy = 0, will lead to the well known relation between the electric current in the x direction and the electric ﬁeld in
the y direction, i.e., jx ∝ n2Ey/(µB) up to small corrections suppressed by the second power of the magnetic ﬁeld
and the relaxation time [48]. Now, the leading order term in such a result is indeed standard and independent of the
relaxation time.

Similarly, after performing the sum over λ in the expression for the axial current density in Eq. (56), we derive

(72)

The ﬁrst term in j5 is the celebrated chiral separation eﬀect current. The second term is a diﬀusion current. The
third term is the axial current associated with the chiral electric separation eﬀect [52]. The rest are new terms.

E. New contributions to the electric current

Let us discuss the new terms in the electric current (67) connected with inhomogeneities of the electric and axial
charge densities in chiral plasma. The ﬁrst of the three new types of currents is associated in a simple way with a
chiral diﬀusion,

j∂χ = −

2eτ µµ5

3π2c

∂µ5
∂x

.

(73)

It is induced in a plasma in which both the fermion-number and chiral chemical potentials are nonzero. The direction
of the current coincides with the gradient ∂µ5/∂x. The current of the second type goes perpendicularly to the
magnetic ﬁeld, as well as to the gradient of the electric/chiral chemical potential, i.e.,

jB×∂ =

eτ 2µ

3π2 (cid:18)B ×

∂µ

∂x(cid:19) +

eτ 2µ5

3π2 (cid:18)B ×

∂µ5

∂x (cid:19) ,

(74)

therefore, we will call this current the Hall diﬀusion. The currents in Eqs. (73) and (74) occur already in absence of
electric ﬁelds. The current of the third type is driven by a time-dependent electric ﬁeld,

j∂tE = −

eτ 2T 2

9c (cid:18)1 +

3(µ2 + µ2
5)

π2T 2 (cid:19) ∂E

∂t

.

(75)

This current is clearly a time-dependent electric ﬁeld analogue of the Ohm’s current, cf. the second term in Eq. (67).
Finally, we also get the following contributions due to the magnetization current:

j(curl) = −

eτ µ5
6π2c

∂B
∂t

−

eτ
6π2

E ×

∂µ5

.

(76)

The second term is very interesting. It describes a current perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld and the gradient of
the axial chemical potential. Such a current resembles the anomalous Hall eﬀect current [53], which happens in the
absence of magnetic ﬁeld. In the case of the chiral plasma at hand, it describes the anomalous chiral Hall eﬀect.

F. New contributions to the axial current

Let us now turn to the new terms in the axial current (72). The ﬁrst of them, i.e.,

j5,EB =

e2τ 2µ5

3π2

E × B,

(77)

is a chiral analogue of the Hall eﬀect with the axial current induced in a medium with µ5 6= 0. The existence of
this term is very interesting. In principle, it allows one to determine experimentally the sign of the chiral charge of
dominant carriers in a chiral plasma. The corresponding sign could be extracted from the direction of j5 in orthogonal
electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

The current of the second type is driven by gradients of the electric and chiral chemical potentials and a perpen-

dicular magnetic ﬁeld, i.e.,

j5,B×∂ =

eτ 2µ5

3π2 (cid:18)B ×

∂µ

∂x(cid:19) +

eτ 2µ

3π2 (cid:18)B ×

∂µ5

∂x (cid:19) .

(78)

13

Obviously, this current is a chiral analogue to the Hall diﬀusion current in Eq. (74). The last contribution to the axial
current is given by two terms

j5,∂tE = −

2eτ µµ5

3π2c

∂µ
∂x

−

2eτ 2µµ5

3π2c

∂E
∂t

.

(79)

Since current (79) vanishes in a plasma where µ or µ5 equals zero, this current deﬁnes diﬀusion and time-dependent
electric ﬁeld analogues of the current of the chiral electric separation eﬀect given by the third term in Eq. (72) (note
that the corresponding numerical coeﬃcients of the currents match too). At last, the magnetization current gives the
following contribution to the axial current density:

j(curl)
5

= −

eτ µ
6π2c

∂B
∂t

−

eτ
6π2

E ×

∂µ
∂x

.

(80)

The last term is analogous to the anomalous chiral Hall eﬀect current, given by the last term in Eq. (76). However,
the corresponding contribution to the axial current is perhaps even more interesting. It implies that, in an electric
ﬁeld, the perpendicular component of the gradient of the chemical potential should lead to a nonzero j5.

Before concluding this section, let us emphasize that the main results of this section are the explicit expressions
for the currents in an inhomogeneous chiral plasma. These expressions provide a critical ingredient in the analysis
of the anomalous Maxwell equations (3) through (6), together with the equations for time-dependent and spatially
inhomogeneous chemical potentials. The corresponding complete set of equations is a starting point for the future
studies of the inverse cascade scenarios with a realistic treatment of plasma inhomogeneities.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, by making use of the chiral kinetic equation, we derived a closed set of anomalous Maxwell equations
relevant for the study of relativistic plasmas with chiral asymmetry and inhomogeneities. By utilizing an expansion
in powers of electromagnetic ﬁelds and derivatives, we derived electric and axial currents as well as a closed set
of the coordinate-space equations for the electric (or fermion number) and chiral chemical potentials. We studied
the two regimes in which the zero order distribution function is given by the standard Fermi-Dirac distribution
function and a boosted one. The latter realizes the drifting state where the plasma drifts as a whole with the drift
velocity perpendicular to both electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In this case, the expansion proceeds only in powers of the
component of electric ﬁeld parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld whereas the perpendicular component of electric ﬁeld is taken
into consideration exactly. In addition to the Hall current for the electric current, we found its analogue for the axial
current generated by the axial density. The chiral magnetic eﬀect current is reproduced exactly in the drifting state.
What is surprizing is that we also found two additional electric and axial currents of a possible topological origin.
They resemble the chiral magnetic/separation currents, but ﬂow perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld and are driven
by the perpendicular component of electric ﬁeld, as well as the scalar product of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

While a relativistic QED electron-positron plasma provides perhaps one the best examples of a plasma in the
drifting state, quark-gluon plasma at suﬃciently large temperatures may give an example of plasma where the drift is
not fully developed because electromagnetically neutral gluons provide an essential drag on the charged particles. For
such a case, we treated both electric and magnetic ﬁelds as perturbations and derived the expressions for the densities
and currents to the second order in electromagnetic ﬁelds and derivatives. In the special case of vanishing electric
ﬁeld, we found a solution in the form of a diﬀusive chiral magnetic wave with the propagation speed vCMW ∝ |eB|/T 2,

see Eq. (66). The diﬀusion constant is given by c2τ /3, where τ ∼ 1/(cid:2)e4T ln(1/|e|)(cid:3) is the relaxation time [42].

In the framework used, we also derived the explicit expressions for the fermion-number and chiral densities, as
well as the corresponding currents. The results are in agreement with the continuity equations, supplemented by the
appropriate quantum anomaly term. The ﬁnal results reproduce several previously known eﬀects. In the case of the
electric current, we reproduced the Ohm’s and diﬀusion currents, as well as the the chiral magnetic eﬀect. In addition,
we found several new types of contributions connected with inhomogeneities in relativistic plasma that have not been
reported before. They are the chiral diﬀusion and two diﬀusion terms of the Hall type perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld. There is also a term driven by a time-dependent electric ﬁeld. One of the very interesting new contributions
is the anomalous chiral Hall eﬀect current, which describes an electric current perpendicular to the applied electric
ﬁeld and the gradient ∂µ5/∂x. The origin of this current is related to the Berry curvature. We also ﬁnd that there
is its counterpart in the axial current density, which is driven by the electric ﬁeld and the gradient of the chemical
potential. It is even more amazing because it can be induced even in a chirally symmetric plasma.

In the case of the chiral current, we reproduced the well known results for the chiral separation and chiral electric
separation eﬀects. We also found an expected diﬀusion current and several new types of currents including a chiral

14

analogue of the Hall eﬀect, which may allow one to experimentally determine the sign of the chiral charge of dominant
carriers in a chiral plasma. In addition, there are two new types of chiral diﬀusion currents of the Hall type and two
diﬀusion and time-dependent electric ﬁeld analogues of the chiral electric separation eﬀect.

The theoretical framework of our study here is a starting point in the study of the inverse cascade scenario proposed
in a number of recent papers. In the simpliﬁed analysis of the corresponding dynamics, it is often assumed that a
space-average currents and density correctly capture the underlying dynamics of the inverse cascade.
It is quite
natural to suggest that such an assumption may not be justiﬁed. Indeed, the underlying mechanism relies on the
clear separation of the short- and long-range modes at the scale set by the chiral chemical potential. If the latter
is not uniform, a whole window of length scales opens, where the dynamics does not have a preferred direction of
the cascade. If the underlying processes in this region would happen to enhance the degree of inhomogeneities, the
corresponding window of length scales would widen and prematurely quench the cascade. Indirectly, this may have
been conﬁrmed by a recent study in Ref. [54], although the conclusions of that study are not unambiguous.

The natural continuation of the present study is a critical re-examination of the cosmological inverse cascade
scenario, in which plasma inhomogeneities are properly accounted for. The corresponding investigation seems possible
only by making extensive use of numerical methods. That is beyond the scope of the present paper, but will be
attempted in the future study and reported elsewhere.
